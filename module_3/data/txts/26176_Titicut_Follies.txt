<i>The trumpet calls, the people shout,
"Strike out the band!"</i>
<i>The cymbals ring,
for one and all</i>
<i>The martial swing.
Strike out the band!</i>
<i>Let's get on with the show,
it's a hippy-hippy-ho</i>
<i>Come on, boys, let's go, let's go.
It's simply great</i>
<i>Come on people.
Come on, let's go</i>
<i>Hey, leader, strike out the band!</i>
<i>That drums resound,
the trumpets call</i>
<i>The people shout,
"Strike out the band!"</i>
<i>The cymbals ring,
calling one and all</i>
<i>The martial swing.
Strike out the band!</i>
<i>Let's get on with the show,
it's a hippy-hippy-ho</i>
<i>Come on, boys, let's go, let's go.
It's simply great</i>
<i>Come on people.
Come on, let's go</i>
<i>Hey, leader, strike out the band!</i>
And it keeps getting better.
Now, I'm gonna read a paper.
The next one is a Western camporee
by Fred, Stan, Joe, and Steve.
But it takes them a little while
to a car going or something.
So, this reminds me of a little joke.
I bet you people thought
I had no talent at all.
These two beetles
are walking down the street...
and they saw Father Mulligan.
And he had a broken arm.
They said,
"Father, how did you break your arm?"
He says, "I fell in the bathtub."
They said,
"Geez, that's too bad, Father."
So they continue to walk down the street.
So one beetle says to the other,
"What's a bathtub?"
And the one beetle says,
"To hell do I know, I'm not a catholic!"
Next... Russell. Come around.
Next... Let's go.
Quincy.
Harry... Harold, come here.
Over here... get your clothes on.
Was any actual... sexual relation
between you and this female child?
Yes...
How old was the child?
- Only eleven.
- Eleven.
And how did you feel
about that you commit such crime?
I didn't feel good about it.
Do you have any conscious experience...
or any recollection about the time
that did you have in your mind,
when you involved to this crime?
Do you remember
or have you been drunk or...
been under drug or been intoxicated.
I was drinking.
You were drinking...
What did you drink?
Whiskey.
Did you need to shout
at this girl on the street?
Yes...
This girl, is very underdeveloped girl...
looks at least older than her age?
- Eleven years?
- No.
So, quite immature child?
A young girl?
Are you have these experiences,
or these practices before,
or this is just the first time?
I had before.
You did commit this crime before?
Or similar... you have been recalled
for similar charges before?
No, I've never been caught before.
Never been caught,
but you have been in practice...
in this way that you abused
a younger child?
Even my own daughter.
Even your own daughter?
And how you feel about
that you do things like that?
How did your wife felt?
How did wife feel about it?
My wife... said that something was wrong.
Must have been.
Myself, I assume... the way
I am right now, if I stay like this...
I'd sooner go to jail than stay here.
McCreary. Take your clothes off.
Okay there, let's go.
- Sommersault, Cullahan.
- Sommersault, come here.
Richard! Come here, Richard.
Over here.
Take them off.
Come on.
Get your hands out.
Turn around... turn around!
Put your hands out again.
Okay...
Take your stuff and get over there!
Take your stuff and get over here!
Now get dressed-- here.
Do you know what in masturbation?
How often you masturbate a day or a week?
Sometimes three-- three times a day.
That's too much.
Why do you do this when you have
a good wife, and she's attractive lady?
She must not have been...
She must not have been giving you
too much sex satisfaction.
Are you tired about your wife?
Maybe you interested in other woman?
If I am interested in any woman...
I don't know...
You have ever get the conscience
about to have a machoed woman...
A big tall... or husky,
luscious looking female?
What you are interested in,
big breast or small breast?
- In a woman?
- I never thought anything.
You have any homosexual experiences?
I guess you had.
What was it?
- You mean with someone else--
- With men... not that boy.
When I was young.
- What was it?
- I was young.
Just masturbating, stuff like--
You tried to masturbate other men, huh?
Other boys?
No, they used to do it to me.
In a public masturbation,
common masturbation--
You engage in a common masturbation
with other men-- other young men?
How long did you did this--
How long you have these practices?
I started when I was in Boy Scouts.
Went on a hiking trip.
We were camping.
It started in this... guy who used to live
near the house. He was quite old.
You have not never had a guilt feeling
when you masturbate?
It was going to kick my balls, I told him,
"Doctor... I'd much prefer", uh!
I told the doctor-- before coming here,
I didn't want, uh!
I didn't want my balls took out of me.
So they took the clothes off instead.
Right there!
You actually don't understand
that you are a sick man?
If I know that there's something wrong,
otherwise I wouldn't do things like that.
But if that's the way I am, right...
You have been in jail,
you've been in house of correction,
you've been in reformatory...
you've been in "Lyman School," and...
You have been involved
in criminal plans that says
break and entering, assault and battery...
driving without authority and so forth...
And additionally you have moral charges:
You-- your own daughter, and other
young immature children,
female children.
And you have been trying
to hang yourself,
you've been assaulting other people,
you've been setting fires, and you've been...
quite intolerant and apprehensive,
and stressed and depressed.
Do you think you are normal man?
What do you think? And you still believe
that you don't need help?
Sometime ago you told that you needed help.
No, I need help, but I don't know
where I can get it.
You can get it here, I guess.
I-- I-- I--
Oh, I--
I-- I-- I--
I-- I couldn't belch the doctor.

Yes, it will.
It's going to be clean.
Okay, see ya later.
Bye bye now.
This was a good one.
Arnie? Come on, Arnie.
Hello, Arnie. What's the matter?
What do you got in your mouth there?
I had something in my mouth.
Take it out of your mouth.
Drop it on the floor there.
I do not know, man could
not know... where to work.
Do you wanna go to work?
- Yes, sir.

Doing anything helping out.

How about giving us that watermelon plant?
Where can I work?
I'd like to know where can I work?

- Where.
Where?
Well, whatever you feel like doing.
What do you feel like doing?
What can you do?
What can you do?
Okay? All right.
Go ahead... Bye.
Hey, Stan.
How come your room is so dirty, Jim?
- How come--
- The goddamn thing isn't dirty.
What? What'd you say?
What'd you say, Jim?
- I did not say anything.
- What?
- I did not say anything!
- I didn't hear you.
Speak up, man. I can't hear you.
What'd you say?
- Come on, Jim, let's go wash up.
- You can get changed.
- How's that room, Jim?
- Very fine.
- What?
- Very clean.
- Why put--
- What'd you say?
How's that room, Jim?
Answer me.
Are you going to have that
room clean, Jim? -Yes, sir.
You could have had it all done last night, hm?
Is it cold?
Yesterday was the coldest, right?
- What you say, Jim?
- Hare cool!
What? What'd you say, Jim?
How's everything going
to be tomorrow, Jim?
How's everything going
to be tomorrow, Jim?
- Hey, how's your room going to be?
- Very neat, very clean.
How come it's not clean today?
You told me that yesterday.
What happened? Huh?
How come you didn't put
all your clothes up?
- How's that room, Jim?
- Very clean, as clean as I can keep it.
What you say? Answer me, Jim!
- Okay, Jim.
- Thank you very much indeed.
Have a drink of water, Jim,
before you go back.
All right.
How's the net been, right?
If it is on account of the house, Jim.
- There.
- Thank you.
You can have some more if you want,
Jim. -Oh, I don't need any more.
- What'd you say, Jim?
- How's that room gonna be tomorrow?
Great, great.
Spick and span, right clean!
- What? Real clean, Jim?
- Yes, sir!
What? What are you doing, Jim?
Good morning, Jim.
Good morning.
- How's that room going to be tomorrow?
- Great bet the mornings.
- What? What'd you say?
- I said that I am going to be clean!
- Louder, Jim.
- Didn't I?
- What?
- Didn't I?
What'd you say?
I can't hear you, Jim.
- What are you hiding, Jim?
- All right, come on, let's go.
Everything's gonna be clean?
How's that room going to be?
How's that room going to be, Jim?
- Hold it.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
Very clean.
Keep that room clean, Jim.
How about keeping that clean, Jim?
- Do you play the piano, Jim?
- Yes.
What'd you say, Jim?
What do you play?
"In my home in Fitchburg."
Fitchburg?
Yeah. 84 Arlington Street.
- Were you a school teacher, Jim?
- Short while.
Junior high school.
Teacher of Arithmetic and Mathematics.
- Which college did you go to?
- Fitchburg State Teacher's College,
Fitchburg Normal School.
Fitchburg Business College,
Fitchburg High School.
Did you graduate with honors, Jim?
So I took it home... I didn't think about it
and I hung it in the closet.
So about a week, my wife opened
the door of the closet of the stairs,
the gas left out of the clothes-- you know?
It rises, eyes started watering,
ya know. Oh geez!
That gas hangs around for months at a
time, you know, gets in all the cracks.
It's a bastard.
The only thing that dissipates it is heat.
- Give it plenty of heat.
- So how'd they get rid of it?
That's how you get rid of it-- heat.
Downstairs, he was in
that cage, you know-- downstairs.
We had a couple of big fans in there.
We had the heat blasting,
we had those fans
in there... steady for about a week.
All the time going,
before we could get the gas out, ya know?
Incredible.
One time they gassed the guy down
there, I forget who the hell it was.
Eddie Mitchell. And he was in the
bull-pen. And they gassed him one day.
That was one of my days off,
so when I came back,
I didn't know they had gassed him.
I went downstairs,
I said, "Jesus, that piss
is really starting to smell!"
My eyes were watering.
They really were.
I didn't know.
I thought,
"Jesus, my eyes are watering!"
Couldn't figure it out, I go upstairs
and start checking the books...
and sure enough, they had gassed
Eddie Mitchell a couple of days before.
That gas, you know,
it was right in the car.
I don't like them, it seems
to affect the shit out of me fast.
I just get one whiff of it and...
<i>I want to go to Chicago Town</i>
<i>That's where I long to be</i>
<i>Just you and me</i>
<i>I want to ride on the chute, the chute</i>
<i>And on the merry-go-round</i>
<i>Oh, what a joy to be only
a boy in Chicago Town!</i>
Thank you!
Willie! And me!
Get you out of this place.
You take a little bit some time
and with medication--
But that's what I'm taking, I mean,
now you give me the same story again.
"We are going to help you."
May I ask just why I need this help
that you are literally forcing on me?
- I'm not forcing anything--
- Obviously, I talk well, I think well,
- I am well, and you are ruining me.
- May I say something?
We are not forcing you-- if you say
"I don't want to take--"
No, no, no!
I don't want to stay here, I am a prisoner.
If you say,
"I do not want to take the medication."
- We agree, you do not have to take it.
- But that's not the principle, Doctor.
The principle is that I am here,
obviously well and healthy,
and I am getting ruined.
If we send me back to the prison,
where I might be able
to get there on the street,
- as I should have.
- If I send you back to prison today,
you might be able to get back
in the same day to Bridgewater.
- No, no, Doctor, not unless--
- If you don't believe it, I let my--
Spit on my face, you know.
Now why should I do that? -Because
if I say untrue, unreliable things,
that I should be punished.
If we send you back to Walpole today,
you're coming back tomorrow--
or maybe even tonight.
Honest to God.
- But doctor--
- You want to make it?
- You want to have a chance?
- Yes, yes, I certainly do.
But why are you so certain that I should
be back tonight or tomorrow?
Because they look at you and they know
that there is something wrong.
But Doctor, you are saying that I would
be back here tonight or tomorrow.
Obviously I have been weakened
since I have been here.
I'll tell you something-- -Yes, I figure
that I have been done harm here,
since I've been here.
Now you tell me that if I should go back,
I will be back here--
now obviously you must know something
- that I do not know.
- I'll tell you something.
I have to leave you now
but I have to tell you something.
It's just paranoia, which is, excuse me,
which is nothing...
Nothing...
- which is nothing really dangerous.
- I know...
In some cases schizophrenia paranoia is
dangerous, as the dictionary would say.
But practically it's not dangerous.
Schizophrenia paranoia is merely the love
of your mother and father--
or unless you just happen to get
somebody else's schizophrenia paranoia,
which does happen,
which is not amicable to the body.
In my case, it happens to be
the love of my mother and father.
If it's schizophrenia,
and in that case it is not...
You mean that's why the man diagnosed
schizophrenic paranoid,
because he loved his mother and father?
Then I am a schizophrenic too,
because I loved my mother and father...
But I have never been in a mental
institution, nobody thought I should be!
Doctor, I am using your words.
You looked at me and you tell me
I'm a schizophrenic paranoia.
Just how do you know?
Because I speak well?
Because I stand up for what I think?
Because you got the
Psychological testings--
I did? Such as?
A test which asked me--
wait a minute, doctor--
How many times do I go to the toilet?
Do I believe in God?
I mean, how ridiculous can you get?
I may never go to the toilet,
or I may go to the toilet,
or I may go to the toilet, or
I may believe in God or I may not.
It's not the business of a doctor.
In white clothes we actually see
the God with the toilet!
No, this is the test! You see me? What
does that have to do with my sanity?
Obviously, you pick out this--
On your test--
No, no, wait! Your test
asked me when I go to the toilet!
How often I go to the toilet! Even
how often my friends go to the toilet!
The test asks, "How often
do your friends go to the toilet?"
Then it says: "Do you believe in God?
Do you love your mother?
Do you love your father?"
It is really, I should say, not the business
of any kind of doctor or physiologist--
Physicist.
No, physiologist.
Well, a physician might go for that too.
Now, you're keeping me here
a year and a half,
and I keep saying the same story...
Let's walk a little.
Now... after a year and
a half of being harmed,
you turn around and say
if I should go back to prison--
- To the toilet?
- No-- No, to the prison.
To the prison. You say
that I might be back tonight or tomorrow.
Obviously you must consider
the surroundings has
something to do with it...
What did they call the first big war?
How did the first big war start?
Because of a demand
by the Austria-Hungary dynasty
for the execution of an inmate
who was already sentenced
to a life imprisonment in Serbia.
Yet they demanded a prosecution,
an execution by Austria-Hungary laws.
What does that mean?
They wanted an execution,
and the war was fought over an execution.
The same execution that
is going on in Vietnam
over the American execution
of these natives of Vietnam.
They are not Viet Cong.
They are not Communists.
Anyone the American
government doesn't like
they use the voiced term of communist.
Because I speak the way I do
you going to call me a communist?
I am not a communist!
Even though I have
communist affiliations.
Communist really means: community-ist.
That's what we are, community-ists,
if you want to call us communists,
because we are for a community.
We like the wealth standards,
we are for people,
and that's what they call
people that talk about-- agitators.
We agitate.
Do we start these troubles?
I'm a communist because I expound
my views about the world conditions?
It is the duty of every citizen
to expound his views or her views
of what goes on in the world.
If more expounded their views
about the conditions in the world,
less chaotic conditions would exist,
and a nuclear war is in the offing.
Because... not what I say,
not what all these warmongers
or peacemongers blab about,
because all through the
ages, you will find
every time a new weapon was put out.
They say these dreadnoughts
is the end of war.
They said the submarine
was the end of war-- what happened?
The gas masks put an end to war--
what happened? They got gas masks.
What about these submarines
that are supposed to control the seas?
What happened? They got airplanes
that dropped depth charges.
You look through the ages, you'll
find that for every new weapon put out,
somebody puts out a counter-weapon.
But the nuclear weapon doesn't stop
because people are stockpiling.
Anybody that starts stockpiling
weapons... eventually uses them.
They get tired of stockpiling,
and then they're just like
a bunch of little kids.
They figure they've got toys to play with,
they're going to play with those toys!
But at the first chance you get,
you wait til 1967
and the 1970s,
you're gonna see
the greatest nuclear war of all time.
1967, you're gonna see what happens.
I can tell you how to get those
situations-- -Wait a minute-- No, okay.
Those people-- the communists
are going to offer them something,
and they'll be fooled.
The Communists will give them nothing
but regimented government.
Strictly regimented government. -So,
why did the war in Southeast Asia start?
They are trying to plan people's futures,
and they cannot do it because--
No, no! The original navigators
that flew missions in Southeast Asia
using the abbreviation called S-O-VIETNAM.
It means, to the navigator who doesn't
see anybody, SOVIETNAM-- name!
Soviet name and they hated the title--
Like I'm saying,
but those people like us,
what they're going to accept,
no matter who tries
to fight it out of them.
- There are forces that are beyond--
- Nobody can stop them.
that are beyond your
mental abilities to realize,
what do you call it, what happens.
You are not qualified to judge the
planetary system, the universe system.
How about this? The Communists
are terrorizing those people.
Oh, the Communists...
They're just plain natives, that's all.
There are other factors,
mitigating factors,
that you don't understand,
that do take place in Southeast Asia.
Give me an answer. Why is terrorization
of those people supposed to be--
Show me! Who? Who? -Supposed
to be able to take over their country
and hold it in such a secure reign?
Look, there have been terrorism in
Southeast Asia for about 300 years.
- From the Communists, lately.
- Wait a minute, if you want to stop--
- And Buddhists.
- Oh, no it isn't.
You want to stop that war in Southeast Asia--
The Buddhists, by suicide, are trying
to kick out the government of Ky
because they think he is collaborating
with the Communists.
It's their country! That's their natural
prerogative. That's their natural right.
To try to kick out anybody
that tries to influence their nation,
influence their governments.
They have no proof!
They have no proof--
What's the American
government doing there?
...of collaboration with the
communists-- suggest that--
- Let John talk.
- All right, no, no you tell them!
And the main factor
about South Vietnam that people
don't realize-- there are
French influences.
There are still French, you could say,
drawbacks from the French revolts.
They're still trying to monopolize
the American military there.
You draw out the French from
Southeast Asia, you have no war in Asia.
In fact, Ky and some of the others are,
you could say, puppets
of the French regime,
and they're just trying to promote,
fill in the gaps that
the French weren't able to do.
And there isn't
a nation in the world
that can do more than
what the French have started.
The Americans will reach
the same rut that they are,
because there's one great factor
that influences the war in Southeast Asia.
America is the female part of
the Earth World, and she's sex crazy.
Her sexiness brings on wars,
like the sperm that is injected
by a man into a woman,
and by a woman into her own body.
It has the same effect, same influence,
only this is in a gigantic pattern.
A gigantic pattern is vile. You mean to
tell me after you've had sex intercourse
you feel fine, or you feel healthy?
You don't.

Mr. Malinowski, do you realize
that you not eaten for long
and we should give you some food?
Then this is the question whether
you agree to drink this food
or I will put through a tube
through your nose, into your stomach.
You want to drink it? Or we'll get
the tube and put it in your nose?
What are you drink it or not?
You want to drink it?
Let him sit down.
Maybe he drink it.
You want to drink it or you want
to have it up through your nose?
You drink it or you'll dump it down
the tube through your nose.
Get me a little drinking water.
Put the towel--
Give me the towel.
Here's some Vaseline,
there ain't much of anything left.
- There any mineral oil?
- No.
It's hardly worth it.
We don't usually do this, ya know.
Is there any other grease or margarine oil
or any oil or anything?
Any one of you gentleman
write down on a little piece of paper
what you will need an F for.
Mineral oil, jelly, ointment,
what you need--
- Alcohol--
- We needed thorazine and dexedrine.
You couldn't get a supply
for this kind of thing.
- Is there only grease? Butter?
- Butter? We've got plenty of butter.
Any butter.
This guy is a veteran.
He's been tube fed before.
Swallow... Just swallow. Swallow.
Swallow. That's a boy.
The mark is down there,
what are you doing?
- Here?
- Yeah, right there.
Fetch some water, yeah?

Yeah.

- Thanks!
Watch when you pull.
Very good patient. Very nice.
Okay, here Doctor.
Release him, take it off.
Oh, hey that wasn't bad.
He's a veteran.
- I think he's been tube fed before.
- I guess so-- Gotcha.
- Okay, you had your dinner.
- He is an experienced kid at that.
- Hold my hand.
- Watch the tube, will you!
Congratulations, and a Happy Birthday!
There's going to be a big blow.
I can see it coming!
<i>Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?</i>
<i>Have you ever loved someone,
just as I love you?</i>
<i>Can't you see that I'm sorry,
for each mistake I've made?</i>
<i>Can't you see that I've changed, dear?
Can't you see that I've paid?</i>
<i>Be a little more giving,
take me back in your heart</i>
<i>How can I go on living,
now that we're apart?</i>
<i>If you knew what I've been through,
then you'll know why I ask you</i>
<i>Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?</i>
<i>Have you ever been lonely?
Have you ever been blue?</i>
All right, here's one sliver of cake.
Oh, that one got away.
Do you think you're able
to stand tall now? -Oh, sure.
- Well, good!
- I'm on medication.
They just found the medication, ya know,
January, last January.
What does the medication do for you?
It relaxes my muscles. When I
get nervous, my muscles get tense,
and I feel like--
Now you just want to feel like--
go to sleep. -Yeah, I feel relaxed.
Not sleepy but-- I don't get angry...
Nothing bothers me.
<i>I was at the bar, at the bar,
where I smoked my first cigar</i>
<i>And the nickels, nickels,
nickels rolled away</i>
<i>It was there by chance,
that I stole a pair of pants</i>
<i>And now I am serving 30 days</i>
You know that fella who's
master of ceremonies? -Yeah.
- They tell me he's the worst paranoid.
- Is that so?
- Who, Willy Williams?
- Willy Williams.
You'd think he was just so relaxed, and
you'd think he'd been doing it for years.
Yeah, and he's a paranoid!
They can't reach him.
You reach him, Allison.
It is a letter from an inmate of mine.
They sent me this letter.
I wish you could read it, really. An
inmate from the other side, an alcoholic.
Look at the nice letter he wrote me.
- Well yeah, Wilhelm.
- Well, isn't that nice!
- And he sent this medal to me.
- He sent that?
He sent that. Isn't that nice? I hope we
cured him, but it really is a lovely letter.
- It is. It really is.
- It makes you feel good?
Well, it makes you feel good
that you're doing a little something
from even at the time
you don't think you're helping them
because they have such a problem.
But when you get a letter like this,
it makes you feel as if--
well, you at least tried.
Come on boys, all of you fellas
standing back there.
Come on up here and show us
what your aim is.
Oh, come on!
What's so bashful?
All right, move over fellas.
We've got a fella
who's going to aim right in the middle.
That's it! Right up to it.
And stick it right-- all right, put it on.
Good, oh! I think you
got licked, young man.
I think you got licked that time.
Yes, you got licked that time. All right,
come on, somebody else be here.
I'm off! I'm off, I'm gone.
We have to know your numbers.
Here we are, that's it.
Now, here's the fella who's going
to put it right on the bulls eye!
Now line it right up with this.
This is where you're coming, bang-o!
When you hear my voice,
you'll know you're here.
Come on... Shut your
eyes. Come right at it!
Straight ahead,
you're coming right for it!
Come on a little further,
a little further.
That's the way.
Now right on that bulls eye.
Oh, that's perfect. Very good.
You're inside the ring at least.
Now hold the number.
Now who else? Come on, now who else?
Come on over and try it! Well, is that
everybody? Has everybody tried it?
You know, this is the first time
we've played this game,
and I want you all to try it.
<i>I want to go to Chicago Town,
that's where I long to be</i>
<i>Just you and me</i>
<i>I want to ride on the chute, the chute,
and on the merry-go-round</i>
<i>Oh, what a joy to be only a boy
in Chicago Town!</i>
<i>It's do or die for MCI
and that is our gay philosophy</i>
<i>And we'll lose our jobs--</i>
Wait a second.
<i>Yes?</i>
Mary, do I have anything listed
for court tomorrow or anything else?
- <i>No, you don't.</i>
- Thank you.
I have nothing for court tomorrow,
tomorrow's fine.
Oh good God, no!
I'm usually here unless I'm dead by then,
and I've got a cold and I may be.
I usually get here by 8:15 or 8 o'clock.
So, at your convenience.
Okay, well the earlier the better.
Okay, why don't you
do me a favor, give me a call.
What time do you get up in the morning?
Why don't you give me a call
as soon as you roll out of bed at home,
just to make sure I'm alive enough
to get down here.
Oh God, no.
Well, let's put it this way:
If I'm sick, with four children
in the house, I'll be awake.
And usually I get up at 5:30, otherwise.
Don't make it much later than that
because I'm out the door
to get down here.
Okay. Bye bye.
Vladimir, as I promised you before,
if I see enough improvement in you--
But how can I improve
when I'm getting worse.
I've been trying to tell you,
day by day I am getting worse.
Because of the circumstances,
because of the situation.
Now you tell me-- until you see
improvement-- each time I get worse!
So obviously it's the treatment
that I'm getting or the situation,
or the place...
or the patients, or the inmates.
I do not know which. I just want to
go back to the prison where I belong.
I was supposed to only come down here
for observation.
What observation did I get?
You call me up a couple
of times, and you say,
"Well, take some medication,
medication for the mind."
I'm supposed to take medication
if I have some bodily injury,
not for the mind. My mind's fit.
I'm obviously logical,
I know what I'm talking about
and I am excited, yes, that's
the only fault you might find with me.
And I have a perfect right to be excited,
I have been here for a year and a half.
And this place is doing me harm.
Every time I come in here,
you tell me I look crazy.
Now, if you don't like my face
that's another story,
but that has nothing to do
with my mental stability.
I have an emotional problem now, yes,
which I did not have.
- What got you down here?
- They sent me for observation.
Why?
They thought--
I went to see a social worker
and I saw a psychiatrist and they said,
"Why don't you go down there?"
I had a little problem.
You thought your coffee was poisoned,
you thought people were mixing you up
in your thinking...
The only part that's true is coffee,
and what sort of treatment
do I get down here?
There are a hundred patients who are
walking back and forth,
who are obviously doing me harm.
Are you working here, Vladimir? -No,
there was no suitable work for me here.
All I've got is the kitchen,
all I do is pull cups on...
In fact, it's noisy. They've got
two television sets which are blaring--
Machines which are going.
Everything which is against the mind.
There is one thing that
a patient does need--
and this is what I do know,
absolutely-- is quiet,
if I have a mental problem,
or even an emotional problem.
Yet, I am thrown in
with over a hundred of them,
and all they do is yell,
walk around, televisions are blaring...
So that's doing my mind harm.
- Are you involved in any sports here?
- There are no sports here!
All they've got is a baseball
and a glove, and that's it.
There's nothing else.
Back at the other place
I have all the facilities to improve myself,
I have the gym, I have the school,
I have all kinds of-- Anything I want.
- Are you in any group therapy here?
- No, there was no group therapy--
Obviously, I do not need group therapy,
I need peace and quiet!
See what I mean? This place is
disturbing me. It's harming me.
I am losing weight,
everything that's happening to me is bad,
and all I hear is, "Well,
why don't you wait?
Why don't you take your medication?"
The medication is disagreeable to me.
There are people
to whom you may not give medication.
Obviously, the medication I got
is hurting me. It's harming me.
In fact, to be specific,
it harmed my thorax.
I do know that much-- what it's harming.
Your thorax? -Yes. It's harmed me.
It's harmed me in every way possible.
Obviously, if you leave me here,
that means you want me to get harmed.
Which is an absolute fact. It's plain logic.
That proves that I am sane.
- Well, that is an interesting logic.
- Yes, it is absolutely perfect.
Because if I am at a place, as if I were
in some kind of a hole or something,
and if you keep me there,
obviously you intend to do me harm.
Isn't that perfect logic?
- No, it isn't, Vladimir.
- It's absolute perfect.
I am getting harmed!
I say I'm getting harmed!
You tell me, that "Until
I show some improvement..."
Each time you said "Until
I show some improvement,"
I have been getting worse.
Medication has harmed me!
- Thank you, Vladimir.
- No, no, I--
Now you can go.
He's been much better than this,
and he's now falling apart.
Now whether this is some reaction
to his medication,
it's certainly something we'll have to look at.
However, he was looking a lot more
catatonic and depressed before,
and sometimes we find
with the antidepressants
you remove the depression
and you uncover the paranoid stuff,
and we may have to give him
larger quantities of tranquilizer--
just to tone this down.
Instead of not looking ready
to be able to make it back to prison...
It is a perfect paranoid pattern,
if you accept his basic premise,
then the rest of it is logical--
but the basic premise is not true.
Of course.
He was very much more closed off
and mute before.
He'd open up in a one-to-one relationship,
but never at a staff meeting.
And he's opened up over
at medical rounds some.
And yet, this is why we had him
brought up to staff
to see what would happen.
And I think he's certainly shown
that he doesn't--
At one time they sought
executive clemency for him.
And it is true that he did learn English--
while he was building up
a great deal of hope...
to get out. And he did get
to the parole board at one time,
and he was...
He's now talking about the same things
about his rehabilitation
from his incarceration up to a given point.
So he's reverting in a way
to that kind of thinking.
Another thing, he's terrified of leaving.
And the louder he shouts
about going back
the more frightened
he indicates he probably is.
- This is known as Ganzer syndrome.
- Well, not quite.
- Close.
- Well, I think what we have to do with him
is put him on a higher dose of tranquilizers,
and see if we can bring the paranoid
elements under a little better control,
and see if we can get him back on medication.
If he's taking it now
and I'm not even sure he is.
The psychological testing always showed
there was a paranoid
who was the thing that was
going through it all the way.
Right.
Diagnosis: schizophrenic reaction,
chronic undifferentiated type.
With prominent paranoid features.
Okay, Al. Is that good, eh?
Take some of that chocolate pudding off.
How's that feel?
Al, Why don't you lay
right down in the water
so you can get your back washed?
Yeah, soak your piles.
- How does that feel?
- Lay right down there.
Don't drown, Al.
- Sit down, Al. That a boy. Backwards.
- Go backwards, Al.
Albert.
Sit down and face me.
No, face me.
How does that feel?
Don't swallow that water.
- Watch your head.
- There, right there.
- Watch your head by those pipes.
- How does it feel?
- Real good.
- Wonderful?
Water is so special.
Special like champagne, right?
- Like champagne?
- There you go.
Why don't you drink
a little cold water, Al?
Yeah, Al. Don't be drinking that.
Don't be drinking that water.
Al, get some water here if you want.
We put a faucet here.
- Feels good?
- I want to go to the house.
- You feel nice and clean?
- Push right back, Al.
- Do you have four brothers?
- I have to kiss the mirror in his honor.
Wonderful. A nice kiss.
- Okay, Al? All set?
- Okay, let's go.
<i>Peace be to this house</i>
and all who dwell herein.
Sprinkle me with the swab, oh God,
and I shall be purified.
Wash me and I shall remain whiter than snow.
May the lord forgive you
by this holy annointing
and by his most loving mercy,
whatever sins you have committed
by the use of your sight, amen.
May the lord forgive you
by this holy annointing
and by his most loving mercy,
whatever sins you have committed

by the use your sense of smell, amen.
May the lord forgive you

whatever sins you have committed

Now let me have your two hands, please.
May the lord forgive you
by this holy annointing
and by his most loving mercy,
whatever sins you have committed
by the use of your sense of touch, amen.
May the lord forgive you
by this holy annointing

Let us pray. Lord, Holy Father,
almighty and eternal God,
by pouring the grace of your blessing
on the bodies of the sick.
You watch over, with all embracing care,
your creatures.
Be present in your kindness
as we call upon your holy name.
What is indulgences?
Indulgences is where--
Even a blessed person, Father Mulligan,
with his confessional there,
telling the truth, and exposing
and calls it down to the warden Johnson
and things like that,
and they get around to it.
Father, even the rabbi,
and not only Rabbi but the
Christian Scientist, and the minister--
We know all about them,
I know everything,
because I am psychic,
I read their fucking minds,
and they're no good,
they're money-changers,
Judases, and that's all.
Though I'll tell you one thing,
even Pope Paul is not without sin,
'cause even him, and the cardinals,
and the sea of Trent,
helped to crucify the man
named Pope Pius, and the hiccups,
and the minister of truth,
who was their fucking doctor.
And Pope John could tell you the same
thing-- it was never decreed that way.
The vicar of the church is Jesus Christ,
and the blessed Virgin Mary,
and I say, he's unworthy
of being the Pope of this world.
And I announce that the rightful Pope
now is Archbishop Fulton Sheen,
and the other one, Cardinal Spellman.
So help me God. I, Borges, say so.
<i>For the glory of the glory
of Father Mulligan</i>
<i>For the glory of his love
and his holiness</i>
<i>For the glory of the glory
of thy love</i>
<i>For the glory of the glory
of the bishop</i>
<i>For the glory of the glory
of the Cardinal</i>
<i>For the glory of the pastor
and the rabbi</i>
<i>For the glory of the glory
of his love</i>
She promised me she was gonna
send me cake or something.
She's a liar!
A liar, defector of the truth.
And so is Peabody. I say so.
I, Borges, say so.
<i>For the glory of the glory
of Father Mulligan...</i>
- Can I get a cappuccino?
- No problem.
It's getting colder outside.
I'm sorry, Jim.
- Don't be afraid.
- You're going too far over.
Joe, let me get up in the front.
That's right, take your time.
Now just stand right where you are.
I am the resurrection and the life.
He who believes in me,
even if he dies shall live.
And whoever lives and believes in me
shall never die.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,
because he has visited and wrought
the redemption of his people.
He has raised up a horn
of salvation for us
in the House of David, his servant,
as he promised through the mouths
of his holy ones, the prophets from of old.
Eternal rest granted on him, O Lord,
and let the perpetual light shine upon him.
- May he rest in peace.
- Amen.
May his soul and the souls
of all the faith departed
- to the mercy of God, rest in peace.
- Amen.
Remember, man, that though art dust,
and unto dust thou shalt return.
That is all.
