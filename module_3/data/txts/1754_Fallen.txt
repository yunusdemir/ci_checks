Before there was light there were angels.
One moment darkness
the next, heaven was bright
with glorious beings.
It was perfect.
It did not last.
Lucifer revolted against God.
A line was drawn in paradise.
A war began.
Every angel was forced to choose
the holiness of heaven
or the chaos that roiled outside.
One angel refused
believing the only thing worth fighting for
was a force we now call love.
Cast out of heaven
this angel did not fall alone.
Every angel who had yet to choose
fell in a flash of almighty fury.
These are the Fallen.
Exiled from heaven
they wander the earth
banished until the rebel angel
abandons love and takes a side.
That was then.
This is now.
Is that it?
Must be.
Love you.
My baby.
I just wish I knew how to help you.
I'll be fine.
Look here. It's small.
I wanted you to have something
to open on your birthday.
Thank you.
I love you.
Bye, Dad.
Welcome to Sword and Cross Academy.
For over 75 years we have served adolescents
who because of social and-or
emotional challenges that they face
have been unable to thrive
in a traditional academic environment.
At Sword and Cross we combine
college preparatory education
cutting edge clinical services
and diverse enrichment programs that focus on
personal growth.
Where do you want him this time?
Through there.
I'll be right with you.
Including
fencing, swimming
and the use of our world
renowned Fowler Library.
Our founder's philosophy
is based upon the core principles...
- Now dump your hazards.
- Hazards?
Alcohol. Drugs. Weapons of any type.
Gang related items or clothing.
Music players, tablets,
gaming systems, laptops.
Cell phones.
No, no, no, I need my phone.
You get ten minutes of phone
privileges once a week.
- You're kidding.
- What's this?
- I don't know, it's a present...
- Hazard.
Haven't got all day, Randy.
I'll be right there. Arriane!
Could you show Lucinda to the dorms?
Sure, I got it.
You can pick your bag up after lunch.
So tell me about your weekend, Cam.
I'm all ears.
- Arriane.
- Luce.
We're going to keep him
on a very short leash.
There's no need
to press charges this time, Bill.
You know we've got this covered.
We'll keep a good eye on him.
- You're going to want to stay away from Cam.
- Yeah, why's that?
He's trouble.
Not the good kind.
Let me see your schedule.
Good, you're with us.
- Us?
- Prep-track.
We tend to stick together.
Most kids here are psych referrals.
They're lucky to get through the day
without wetting themselves
or attacking a teacher because
their pencils are unevenly sharpened.
Don't be spooked, though.
They keep them separate.
All the serious mental defectives
are up on the third floor.
It's one big pharmapalooza.
This is me. 208.
Where are you?
313
You're messing with me, right?
You're a psy...
Okay.
Hey.
Sorry.
Tell me about your hallucinations.
What do you call them?
Shadows.
Shadows.
And they started when?
When I was little.
Five or six. I can't remember exactly.
And you still see them?
No. I haven't for a while.
Tell me, Lucinda.
Why do you think you're here
at Sword and Cross?
Ask the judge.
I've read your file.
I know what the judge thinks.
What I don't understand is your decision.
Doctor Segal says that
on medication, you're stable.
No hallucinations.
No paranoia. No nightmares.
I'm not crazy, you know.
No. Nobody's saying you're crazy.
Everybody's saying that.
Do you understand, that if you take
your prescribed medication you can leave.
Go home. Go back to your old school.
Be with your friends.
I don't like the way they make me feel.
But if you refuse, you need to be here
in a court sanctioned treatment
facility, under supervision.
Even if it means being locked up
I'd rather be me than pretend
to be something I'm not just to fit in.
You have a chance at a normal life.
Poor thing.
She has no idea what she's in for.
- Maybe it'll be different this time.
- You know something I don't?
It'd just be nice for a change, that's all.
Alright, let's make it interesting.
Twenty to one Luce goes down
in flames, just like always.
I'm in for a hundred.
- Arriane!
- What?
- Gabbe?
- It's cruel. This isn't a game, Roland.
Maybe it is.
Here we go again.
The mind is its own place and in itself
can make a Hell of Heaven.
What's that?
Milton. Paradise Lost.
- You're Lucinda Price?
- Yeah.
I'm Miss Sophia.
You're in my Philosophy of Religion class.
- Did you come for your books?
- Mm-hmm.
Pre-calc, English lit, Chemistry,
Religion and History.
Oh, still missing one.
Would you mind? It's in special collections.
Sure.
Ah, it's a pleasure to meet you, Luce.
Thanks.
Hi.
Hey, wait.
You dropped this.
Shit!
You scared me.
Alright.
You poor thing.
- Jeez.
- Oh, did you fall?
Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.
You've never been less fine
in your whole nauseating existence.
Coming here was a bad choice.
Listen, if I did something
to upset you, I'm sorry...
You make me sick.
You're nothing.
You bat your lashes and flick your hair
and expect the whole world to come to a stop.
You don't even know me.
I know you're a murdering little psycho.
Hey! Break it up!
Psycho bitch.
You should come with a warning label.
That was quick.
- She...
- Don't tell me she started it.
I'm sure she did.
But that doesn't mean
you have to take the bait.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Fighting is grounds for expulsion.
Which for you would mean
a transfer to the state psych hospital.
Is that what you want?
No.
Since today is your first day and I'm guessing
you've yet to read the code of conduct
I'll just give you yard duty.
And you? You come with me.
You know you're not supposed
to be in here without a pass.
I just, ah...
Oh, no, no, no, that was a joke.
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.
Oh, gosh.
Oh. Not funny?
It's just been a really rough day.
Yeah. Welcome to Sword and Cross.
- This place is...
- Crazy.
I'm Pennyweather Van Syckle-Lockwood.
You can call me Penn.
Okay.
And you are Lucinda Price,
but everyone calls you Luce.
Transferred here from Dover with a 4.2.
Impressive.
How did you know that?
Shoot. Was that stalkery?
A little bit, yeah.
Sorry.
See the thing is, this is a really
small school. Like really, really small.
Like infinitesimally small,
and not a lot happens here.
It's not like Dover, and you're the new girl
and you're smart and you're pretty
so I'm guessing that you're going
to be the centre of a lot of attention
both positive and negative.
Great.
Tell you what.
I'm gonna go, let you do your thing
and then maybe if you're feeling
forgiving you can...
forget the whole me accosting you in
the bathroom with too much information
when you just want to be alone
and then rambling on and on
because I don't know how to stop myself
from talking situation that's happening
right now and give me another chance?
I'll go now.
- Hey, Penn?
- Yeah?
Do you mind showing me back
to the dorms? I'm a little bit lost.
Sure.
Thanks.
What if angels actually walked
among us right now, here on earth?
That's the story of The Fallen.
Angels cast out of heaven
condemned to live their lives
alongside us mere mortals.
Banished, because they failed to pick a side
in Lucifer's war against Heaven.
Who can tell me what the war
in Heaven was about?
Todd?
Good versus evil?
No, that's too simplistic.
Lucifer was God's favourite.
His brightest light.
What caused him to turn from God?
Anyone?
'Cause his girlfriend dumped him.
What happened to the other angels?
Those that sided with Satan
were banished to Hell.
Only the faithful remained in heaven.
The angels that didn't choose,
they were cast out.
They are the Fallen.
Forced to walk the earth
some of the Fallen retained
their angelic nature
repented and wait for the chance
to return to Heaven.
Others aligned themselves with Lucifer
finding pleasure in mischief and chaos.
But neither group can leave this world
because of one of their own.
The rebel angel.
He rejected both sides of the war
God and Lucifer alike
all in his pursuit of human love.
The other fallen angels
must remain here on earth
until he chooses a side in the only war
that has ever been waged.
The war we still see every day
raging all around us.
But surely you learned
some of this in Sunday school?
No, I didn't go to church growing up.
Really?
Yeah, my parents aren't really religious.
So, you were never baptized?
Um, no.
Is it supposed to be over, the war?
I mean, theologically speaking
if the Devil is still alive
What's to stop him trying from trying again?
Excellent question.
So, any more takers on that bet?
- Yep.
- Keep them rolling, Roland.
Luce, you poor thing.
Are you okay?
What is going on here? Is anyone hurt?
No, really, I'm fine.
The food is fine.
- Anything?
- Anything, sweetie.
Definitely your orange cinnamon pancakes
with whipped cream with bananas.
- That sounds...
- Hey!
What's taking so long? Come on.
I need it.
Mom? Mom?
Allocated time completed.
Allocated time completed.
I just can't believe I have to wait
a whole week to talk to them.
You know, I didn't even get
a chance to say goodbye.
You can have my time on Tuesday.
- No.
- Yeah, I'm not gonna use it.
I've been here six years.
Everyone I know is here
and everyone I'm interested
in talking to is in this room.
What about your parents?
I've been meaning to ask.
How I ended up here?
You don't have to tell me.
It's not a big deal.
Well, after my parents got divorced
neither of them really wanted me around so
they decided that boarding school
was in my best interest.
And as soon as my Mom saw that brochure
the one with the kids riding horses
and swimming and stuff
that was it. The search was over,
I was enrolled and here I am.
So you're not a kleptomaniac,
manic depressive, anorexic cutter?
No.
My diagnosis is much worse
and, I'm afraid, untreatable.
I have TDP.
TDP?
Tragically Disinterested Parents.
Yeah, my parents suck.
But there's a pool.
But there is a pool.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Don't tell me.
Is Cam in love?
That could make things difficult for you.
Just don't forget who you work for.
Daniel.
I didn't get a chance to say
thanks yesterday.
Don't mention it.
Well, thank you anyway.
There's one more thing
I'm a little embarrassed to even ask but...
Well, then don't.
Well, I've committed now.
I'm just going to go for it.
It's just you seem really familiar to me.
Like I know you from somewhere.
- Is that possible?
- No.
I'd remember you.
Because I keep thinking that...
I've gotta go, alright? I'll see you later.
Thank you.
Hey, new girl.
Pretty eventful first few days.
Already planning your escape?
Yeah, considering it.
You ah, you want some breakfast?
That's tempting, but I'm actually
running late to class.
It's better never than late.
This is really good.
Where's it from?
I stole it from the faculty lounge.
They have a pretty decent espresso machine.
You're incorrigible.
That's what they tell me.
You don't agree?
I just know what I like.
And you don't mind breaking
the rules to get it.
Well...
if the risk is worth the reward
I don't see why not.
What about you?
You don't end up at Sword
and Cross by following the rules.
You got a little rebel in you?
I'm just misunderstood.
No, I see it.
You got a spark.
What do you mean?
Means you're the kind of person who'd rather
do what's right than what you're told.
It means you're trouble.
You think you know me, huh?
I know what I like.
Time's up.
Roland's having a party this Friday.
- Yeah?
- It's just casual.
- You can bring a friend.
- Okay.
Bunch of us get together at the end
of the week to blow off some steam.
Thanks.
Aren't you in this class?
Oh, I've heard it all before.
En garde! Allez!
How well did they think this through?
You know, giving weapons
to heavily medicated teenagers
with poor impulse control and anger issues.
Halt!
Alright, change partners. Sparks, you're up.
Price, let's see if you've
been paying attention.
Remember what I showed you?
Not really.
En garde!
Allez!
That wasn't terrible
considering it was just your first time.
Alright.
Switch partners.
Grigori. Come on over.
En garde!
Allez!
Very good.
One more. En garde.
Allez!
Grigori, halt.
Halt!
Halt!
Both of you, halt!
I give it a week.
What about the whole baptism thing?
Could that affect her?
The details don't matter.
Grigori always finds something to obsess
over but it never makes a difference.
Now y'all just need to relax
and accept that Luce is gonna die
and there's nothing you or Daniel
or Miss Sophia can do to stop it.
I thought you'd never done this before?
I haven't.
My body just took over.
Like I knew exactly what to do.
Huh.
It was weird. Have you ever felt that?
Yeah, I was kinda
like that with trigonometry.
It all just fell into place so at first
I was like 'wow, I'm a genius.'
But then I remembered that we covered it
last year so I guess that's not as impressive.
You got it bad, huh?
No, it's not like that.
Well, maybe it is.
It's just I have these feelings about Daniel.
Like I know him.
Like I've known him for a really long time.
Yeah, maybe you guys went
to preschool together or something.
Well, I asked him if we'd met
before and he said no
and he basically ran away. It was strange.
Yeah.
Something definitely not quite... hmm.
What do you mean?
I can get in a lot of trouble if you tell
anybody what I'm about to say to you, okay?
I won't.
So I volunteer in the office for my free
period which I know sounds totally lame
 but is actually kind of cool and fun
in its own weird way, sort of.
Turns out Randy is totally useless
when it comes to computers.
So he asks yours truly to do
the most basic tasks like
find files on his desktop and search for
videos of sneezing hedgehogs or whatever.
Meaning
I have full access
to everybody's academic records.
I've looked at Daniel's file.
It's empty.
He's got no home address,
no emergency contact, nothing.
- Do you like this?
- Yeah.
It's the same with all those kids.
There's just something not quite right
about that whole group.
You never hear them talk about
their families or their old schools.
They barely ever go to class and it's like
they all knew each other from before.
Wait, who do you mean?
Daniel arrived first.
He transferred at the beginning
of last year and then Gabbe.
The tall blonde that's always
hanging around him?
Yep, 85 percent confectionary
sugar by volume.
Then Arriane.
Oh, yeah, she showed me around my first day.
And Molly. Serious defective.
And Roland, I have literally no idea
how he passes his weekly pee test
and then Mr. Future 25 Years to Life,
Cam, transferred in last spring.
Miss Sophia, too.
She's new this year and totally ignores
everyone except her favourites.
- Well, what do you make of it?
- Beats me.
- I can't believe it.
- What?
I'm actually going to one
of Roland's parties.
Oh, don't you two look lovely?
Thanks.
You do too. As always.
Aren't you sweet.
Is it wrong that I kind of hate her?
Why, because she's a flawless,
honey-scented, spray tanned,
bikini waxed manicured
blond-fembot who's always smiling
and is at this moment kissing your crush?
Yeah, pretty much that.
It might be wrong, but I totally get it.
Anybody order drinks?
I'm still trying to figure out
how you ended up here.
Well, you invited me, remember.
That's not what I meant.
With the rest of us it's obvious, right?
Drugs.
Vandalism.
Depression.
Nymphomania.
So why did you end up at a place like this?
Maybe I'm not as innocent as I look.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Is that a Flying Lotus jacket?
Yeah.
You are such a hipster.
In... in a good way, I mean.
Like you know,
it's not like you're trying to be cool.
Like you're actually cool.
Wow.
I've been accused
of a lot of things in my life
but never that.
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Thank you.
Oh, is that for me?
Amazing. Thank you so much. Thank you.
Sure.
Um...
So...
Is it from a show, or...?
Yeah. He's amazing live.
I saw him in Asheville with Teebs.
Get out of it. Teebs is my favourite
post-Dilla artist.
Well, Thundercat changed my life.
Well, no, except maybe for Thundercat.
Have you heard the Daylight remix?
That bass.
Exactly.
Yes.
Bad memories?
So do you still think about him?
Who?
The boy you killed. Trevor.
You know, tall, easy on the eyes.
Well, at least he was before
he hooked up with you.
Now he's not so much to look at.
How do you know about him?
- I know a lot about you, Crazy Luce.
- Get that away from me.
I'll bet I know you better
than you know yourself.
For someone who doesn't like fire,
it sure does seem to like you.
That's enough!
Shut up, Arri, before I give you a scar
on your face to match the one on your back.
Back off, Molly.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
What are you doing?
Just having some fun
with your psycho girlfriend.
Stay away from Luce.
You hear me?
Oh, you've lost track, Cam.
You always want what you can't have.
This time she's mine.
Lay off me!
There's definitely life in outer space!
Hey! Where's Luce?
Um, I don't know.
I thought that she was with you.
Okay.
- She doesn't need your kind of help.
- Who's gonna protect her, you?
You know, you lovebirds need
to relax, huh? It's a party.
You know, I'm feeling pretty tired
all of a sudden, actually.
I think I'm just gonna go.
You want me to walk with you?
No, it's okay. You should stay.
Hello?
Molly.
Molly, come on. I know it's you.
Where's Trevor?
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- What did you do, you freak!
It's my fault.
I'm so sorry.
So tell me, how was your first week
at Sword and Cross?
Fine.
No incidents to report?
Visions? Nightmares?
No.
What about your shadows?
Good.
Good.
Good.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
- I just can't get past it.
- What?
This feeling that I know you.
Haven't we been through this?
Yeah, but...
I don't believe you.
There is something between us.
And you feel it too, don't you?
Alright. Okay.
You're right.
I should have just told you the truth.
It's...
Like I realise I haven't been
very warm towards you, and...
You've been a real dick.
Yeah, but believe me. You've got to know
it's not because of anything you've done.
See, there's this girl...
Gabbe?
What? No.
No, not Gabbe.
No, just someone else. Another girl.
I guess you could say
I'm not with her anymore, but
I still love her.
What I'm trying to say is...
You're a mess and I'm better off without you?
Something like that.
It's not that simple.
You can't tell someone how to feel.
Yeah.
I wish things could be different.
Hey! Don't go.
There you are. I was worried about you.
You left the party without saying goodbye.
What's wrong?
Luce? Stop! Talk to me!
I had an interesting conversation
with Molly last night.
- Okay.
- She knew things about me.
- Things I haven't shared with anyone.
- And...
Someone's been talking to her.
Someone who's read my file.
Oh, right, 'cause that makes perfect sense.
I betrayed your trust to a ruthless,
soulless, unimaginative bully
with suspect hygiene and poor
language skills in exchange for what?
Oh, two free body piercings
and a prison tattoo.
I was sure I'd get away with it,
but you caught me.
Well, at least you're big enough to admit it.
What's wrong? Really?
You have read my file, haven't you?
Of course.
So then you know about...
Your shadows?
- Do you still see them?
- Yeah.
Do you see them right now?
No. But since I've been here
they've gotten a lot worse.
And I'm scared. I'm scared
somebody's going to get hurt.
- No, don't be ridiculous.
- I'm not.
Trevor was just standing there.
- He was just standing there and we...
- Okay. Tell me exactly what happened.
Trevor acted like I didn't exist all year
and then suddenly at this party
he was flirting with me.
Come up to the cabin with me.
Just one time I wanted to feel
normal.
- You want a drink?
- Sure.
Did you hear that?
Trevor, are you sure that we're alone?
Luce.
Relax.
No.
Stop. Stop. Get off. Get off!
- What the hell?
- Please, get out of here.
What's going on?
No. No!
Luce?
The shadows were bigger than ever.
And then suddenly everything exploded.
And I don't know how but I was outside
and Trevor didn't make it.
Trevor!
Where's Trevor? Tell me.
I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.
- What did you do, you freak?
It's my fault. I'm so sorry.
Trevor!
And he's dead because
there's something wrong with me.
And I'm really glad you want to be my friend
but you should stay away
from me because I'm dangerous.
Did you want him to die?
- No.
- Did you try to hurt him?
- No.
- Well, then it's not your fault.
You don't need to be alone, Luce.
You need a friend.
Let me help you.
Why?
Because that's what friends do.
Last time we were discussing how it was
Lucifer's pride that led to the fall.
Yes.
So who can translate?
Humilitas homines sanctis
angelis similes facit
et superbia ex angelis demones facit.
Anyone?
It was pride that turned angels into devils.
What was that, Luce?
It is humility that makes men as angels.
It was pride that turned angels into devils.
We have a Latin scholar in our midst.
No, I've never...
It was just a guess.
So how does that relate to the rebel angel?
Wasn't it his pride,
his stubborn pursuit of love over God
that led to the Fallen
being trapped on earth?
Arriane?
I'm tired of listening to you twist these
religious fables to fit your own beliefs.
You tell this story of yours
as is love was a choice.
I don't care for your tone.
Maybe you're just pissed
the rebel angel chose the wrong girl.
Get out.
Gladly.
I'd rather burn in hell for all eternity
than have to listen to one more second
of your pious self-satisfied ravings.
That was kind of awesome.
Yeah. Do you think she'll get suspended?
I doubt she even gets detention.
Those kids get away with everything.
Hey, I forgot my sweater.
I'll catch up with you guys.
Okay.
Listen to me. You've got
to keep your eye on Cam.
What are you talking about?
I don't believe the statue
was an accident. She's in danger.
I saw him on the upper floor
just before it happened.
Why would he do that?
You heard. She isn't baptized.
She needs our protection. She's...
Sorry, I just... I forgot my sweater.
I'll go talk to her.
Hey, Luce!
Wait.
- What? What do you want?
- Nothing.
I just thought maybe we could walk together.
Oh.
Sure.
What were you working on in class today?
Nothing. It's ah...
sort of a graphic novel.
What kind of story?
I guess you could call it a romance.
- Does it have a happy ending?
- I don't know.
- You don't know how it ends?
- No, not yet.
I'm sort of stuck, to be honest.
Well, let's hear it. Tell me your story.
No. No, I don't think that's a good idea.
No?
Maybe I could help you with the ending.
Okay.
It's about this boy and this girl
and they love each other more than anything
but they can never be together.
- Why?
- Because there's this curse.
Every seventeen years they meet
and they fall in love
and then just when
they're happiest, the girl dies.
So it's a tragedy?
What happens to the boy?
He waits.
He doesn't age or change.
He remains in love.
Years pass, and eventually she returns.
The same girl?
She's changed.
She has a new name, new family.
She has no memory of him
but he knows it's her.
It's her soul
reincarnated.
And they fall in love.
Always.
I mean, each time it's slightly different.
There are infinite versions
but the end is always the same.
But then all it takes is a kiss
and she's gone.
Who put the curse on them?
It was the devil himself.
He was jealous of their love,
so he tried to break it.
There has to be something they can do, right?
He's tried everything.
He tries looking for her
then tries to avoid her.
Tries to run away
from the inevitable heartbreak.
But the curse always finds a way,
no matter what.
The girl in your story.
Is she the one you mentioned at the pool?
The girl you're still in love with?
She's the inspiration, yeah.
This girl?
Alright, you got me. It's um...
I was using you for her current incarnation.
This is meant to be Paris.
In 1723.
It's stupid.
Why me?
Because you're beautiful.
But I messed up the eyes.
There's always been something
about your eyes.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Tell me about this place.
Have you been there before?
Does it matter?
- Yes.
- Why?
I've never travelled before.
I've never even left the country.
But I know that there's a café
just off to the right
and I know it smells
like jasmine after it rains.
And I know that the old man that runs the café
is kind to his dog and he's cruel to his wife
and I know these things
because I've been there.
And I've been there with you.
Oh, Luce, come on.
Don't.
Don't tell me that I'm crazy.
Luce, it's a drawing, alright?
It's a story, that's all.
You're lying.
I wish I could tell you
what you want to hear.
I'm sorry.
Blow.
Happy birthday, Luce.
How'd you know?
Did you make a wish?
I can't tell you. It won't come true.
Oh, that's okay.
I already know what you wished for.
Oh, yeah?
What'd I wish for?
Answers.
You want the truth.
Meet me at the arches at eight
and I'll tell you everything.
And Luce?
Wear something nice.
It's party time.
Look at you.
Oh, wow.
Is it yours?
For tonight.
How'd you manage that?
It's Roland's special talent.
Anything you want, he can get it for you.
Am I going to regret this?
There's only one way to find out.
- Come on.
- No way, I drive.
You really want to start the night
by saying no to the girl?
Okay.
What am I doing here with you?
Celebrating.
You're good at that.
Every time I ask you a question
you have some clever way
of avoiding the answer.
That's not true.
Here's an example. Where did you grow up?
See?
How come you won't tell me
anything about yourself?
Because I'm having a nice time
and I don't want to ruin it.
It's that bad, huh?
I prefer this.
You promised answers.
Come on, Luce. It's your birthday.
I'm thinking there's something else
you might want.
What are you doing?
- Stop!
- I told you to stay away from her.
Daniel, what are you doing?
- Why, because you care so much about her?
- Stop it!
- Stop!
- No, because I know what you're capable of.
You're still with Lucifer. Admit it!
Why don't you tell her, Daniel?
Tell her everything.
- She wants the truth.
- Stop it!
- Just stay away from her!
- You don't have a say in it.
I don't know what's going on here
but it has nothing to do with me.
I never bought into that idea that there's
one person you're meant to be with
but my visions are so real
and my feelings are so real
it's like past lives or something.
I don't know.
And everything's connected to Daniel
somehow but he keeps pushing me away.
And Cam's hiding something too.
So what do you think?
I think you're a jerk for not
telling me it was your birthday
but I'm willing to overlook that
because this is so ridiculously juicy.
Do you believe in reincarnation?
No. Not at all.
I didn't think so either but
there has to be some sort
of explanation for this.
Hmm.
Maybe I can help.
What are you doing?
We just need one more thing.
What?
How do you know which room Todd's in?
So how does this work exactly?
Have you got those yearbook photos?
Todd's been working on this really
cool facial recognition algorithm.
It's not all my code.
It was developed at Carnegie Mellon,
but I've tweaked it a little.
He's so modest.
Sorry.
This might take a minute.
It's just searching.
Luce? Hello?
We've got hits.
Whoa.
Look at the name.
It must be a relative.
Oh, what?
The actual... Fuck.
Print it.
I'll get it.
Todd, I'm counting on you
having some sort of explanation
because I am really struggling here.
I haven't got the faintest idea.
I love you.
Let's see what else we can find.
It's happening again.
No.
Leave me alone!
Luce? Everything okay?
Luce?
Penn!
I've gotta find Penn!
Penn!
Penn, where are you?
Todd!
I've gotta find Penn!
- No!
- Penn!
Todd!
Todd!
No!
Here at the school infirmary
we provide the same care
she'd receive at the hospital.
I want to take her home.
The doctor's clear. She needs
to remain under clinical supervision.
- For how long?
- Until she's stable.
You should get some rest.
We'll call you at the hotel as soon
as Luce is able to receive visitors.
There was nothing we could have done.
I refuse to accept that.
I could have warned her.
I could have been there...
- When has that ever helped?
- It doesn't matter, okay?
She needs us and we let her down.
- Is this a criminal investigation?
- Not at the moment.
The fire was caused by lightning.
That report is preliminary.
Given the similarity
to the Trevor Beckman case
we'll definitely want to question her.
I don't want you talking to her
without her attorney present.
We come together today
to mourn the loss of a dear friend,
a kind and generous...
whose life was far too brief
to mourn the loss...
whose tragic passing comes
as a shock to us all.
We will always remember
a kind and generous friend
someone whose company was always a pleasure
and although today we are
understandably overcome with grief
I ask you to have faith that in time
our pain will prove strengthening
and ultimately a testament
to how much Todd mattered
and always will.
Not only was he a loving son
but he was also a kind and generous friend.
We must transform our sadness
into something strengthening.
That's how we celebrate his life
and ensure his legacy.
You show up to his funeral
after you get him killed?
I know you're the one doing this.
What are you talking about?
The statue. The fire in the library.
You were trying to kill her.
Killing Luce is your thing, Daniel.
Don't you dare...
What's the matter, Daniel?
You afraid of a little competition?
What I feel for Luce is real.
She's different this time.
She deserves more than you can give her.
- If you come near her...
- You'll what?
How many times do you have to watch her die?
I love you.
Luce!
Oh, Penn!
Luce!
Todd?
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry. It's my fault.
Oh, don't say that.
It's true. The shadows were exactly the same.
- It was the exact same...
- Stop it, okay?
You did not cause this.
I won't hear it.
Okay.
I'm so sorry.
Did you make a wish?
Past lives and destinies.
You want the truth.
She doesn't know me at all.
All it takes is a kiss.
But he knows it's her.
Luce! No!
Kiss him and you'll die.
Who put the curse on them?
- It was the devil himself.
- Daniel, no!
Luce, no.
You will die.
You will die.
You feeling better?
Every part of me hurts, but I'm alive.
Well, that's something.
I remember.
- What?
- Everything.
The fire.
You carrying me.
- Being in your arms, it felt like we were...
- Well, you were delirious.
Maybe.
But that's not all I remember.
I remember this.
I remember the day this was taken.
What do you mean?
Enough!
I know what I know.
My whole life people have
told me that I'm crazy.
- Luce.
- Let's see if they're right.
No, Luce, get down from there.
No, Luce.
No!
It will always be you, Luce.
Just as it always has been.
Now is not the time for sentimentality.
Luce?
I gave you this.
It was a long time ago.
How is this possible?
- It's okay.
- No, every bad thing
that's ever happened to me
is because of that.
No, they can't hurt you. They just observe.
The fires. They killed Trevor.
Luce, the shadows didn't cause
the fire and neither did you.
They're called Announcers.
Look.
Think of them as windows into the past.
They're attracted to the most
important moments in your life.
What am I seeing?
Our lives together.
We've been in love for thousands of years.
Luce, all your visions are real.
So we're reincarnated?
You are.
I'm...
An angel.
I'm one of the Fallen.
Stop!
Don't do it, Luce.
Kiss him and you will die.
This is why I tried so hard
to push you away but I can't.
You didn't tell her?
- I'm so sorry.
- Unbelievable. You're unbelievable.
What? I don't understand, why?
The curse is my punishment
for not taking a side at the Fall.
Luce, don't listen to him.
Stay, Luce. I chose you.
I chose love.
Don't listen to him, Luce.
If you kiss him, you will die.
- I've seen it a thousand times.
- No, this time it's different.
I promise it is different.
He's a liar, Luce.
If you stay with me, I can protect you.
You've seen me in my true form.
This is different.
I can protect you.
This could be our chance.
Please.
Luce, I can offer you a future.
A life.
I can't lose you again.
I know what I want.
No!
I'm still here.
You think you've beaten the curse?
You have no idea how much danger she's in.
Lucifer knows she's not baptized.
I don't understand. Tell me why.
He lifted the curse for himself, not for you.
He'll come for her now.
Daniel can't protect you, Luce.
I can!
She's safer with me!
There's a natural order to things, Daniel.
You can't just do as you please.
Well, the cycle's been broken.
Roland! Molly!
Luce!
You're coming with me!
Keep her safe. I need to deal with Cam.
Where I'm taking her,
I don't want him to follow.
He'll lead Lucifer right to us.
They're all angels.
I won't let you take her to Lucifer!
I don't answer to him anymore.
You're the one putting her in danger, Daniel.
Don't pretend you even care about her!
Where are you going?
I can protect her.
Stay away from her!
What the heck!
Back to your rooms. Shut the door!
This is a lockdown.
Wait for the all clear.
It's a lockdown. Shut the door.
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.
I'm not your enemy.
I'm not trying to kill her.
Then who?
Luce! Wait!
She set the fire in the library. She...
Penn?
No!
No!
Go!
Luce, your time has come.
I am tired of waiting.
This ends now.
Every breath you take keeps Daniel
from his rightful place in heaven!
- Daniel!
- You are the real curse.
Luce!
Luce!
Sophia, what have you done?
You claim to be a servant of God.
I am. There's a war going on.
Loyal soldiers do what they must.
Including murder?
You refuse to see the bigger picture.
You always have.
With her gone you'd have been
forced to choose a side
and order would have been restored.
Thank you.
I don't understand why she'd do that.
She's a fanatic, Luce.
She fights for god, but she went too far.
Why would Sophia kill Penn?
Why did she try to kill me?
You're not baptized.
If you die, it'll be forever.
Sophia thought with you gone
I'd have no reason to stay on earth
and I'd return to heaven.
But Cam was right.
Lucifer will be coming for you.
Which is why I need to get you
somewhere safe.
I know a place. I have friends there.
They'll protect us.
We have to go.
I can't leave now. I can't leave Penn.
We'll take care of her.
Penn!
She'll come with us. Go. Please.
Luce.
They'll take Penn with them.
There's no more time. We have to go.
Wait a minute. Listen.
My whole life I've been
searching for the truth.
I've been trying to figure out who I am.
Why I never seem to fit in to the life
that was supposed to be mine.
And now I'm terrified.
I have more questions than I ever have before
but... this is it.
This is who I am.
This is where I belong.
Right here, with you.
I love you.
I've known it
from the first moment I saw you.
It will always be you, Luce.
Forever.
