Miramax Films Presents
A Robert Altman Film
Moscow?
What's this about?
Put that on the desk.
Dear Mr de la Fontaine:
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
Robin.
I told you not to!
It's dirty!
You shouldn't do that!
Not in the house!
You're a shit.
This is Kitty Potter on the scene
for FAD TV.
At the moment,
Paris fashion is a thrilling bore.
But as of tomorrow,
all of that could change.
Tomorrow is the first day
of the prêt-à-porter collections.
It's a strange
and exhilarating moment for fashion.
The only rule is...
Is that there are no rules.
Come on with Kitty.
We'll be going backstage and sipping
Diet Coke with all of the top models.
And we'll meet designers from
supernovas to super nobodies.
Now, let's go behind the scenes
and into the busy workrooms
of some of fashion's biggest thinkers.
Shall we?
Can we roll?
This is Kitty Potter in Paris,
and I'm here with Thierry Mugler,
the cutting-edge couturier
known for his sartorial shock tactics.
Thierry, Thierry, you know,
it's been said that
your clothes have a kind of
overt, extreme sexual subtext,
which is squarely at odds
with the image of women as
capable and independent of men.
So, I was just wondering, our audience
would love to know, really,
what you think about that?
Well, it's all about looking good.
Helping the silhouette.
And it's all about getting
a great fuck, honey.
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Well, that was designer Thierry Mugler
explaining his unique views on style.
This is Kitty Potter in Paris,
and we're backstage with FAD.
How beautiful you are.
I'm Inspector Tantpis.
I'd like to introduce my dog, Ladd.
Oh, yes. I remember your dog.
Heel, Ladd!
I'm going to pouf your hair.
You'll walk faster, huh?
Okay, now you finish.
-And I'd like to see Kiki and Dane.
-Okay, thank you. That's it.
-Okay?
-Okay.
-But quickly, because we are very late.
-Okay, Kiki. Come on.
Kiki, can you stop smoking, please?
-Oh, who's there?
-Simone.
It's wonderful!
-Yeah, well, great things happen to me.
-Twins, no?
Egg and sperm,
and they loved each other.
No, triplets.
Albertine, you've kept a secret from us.
-Who's the unlucky man?
-Well, maybe it's you, darling.
Come on, Kiki, Dane.
Dane, Kiki, come on.
I'm sorry, Simone, I won't be able
to do your défilé this year.
Oh, don't worry. It's no problem.
-You'll get me Eve, huh?
-Eve?
Albertine. Oh, what have we here?
Big fish in the trunk.
How extraordinary.
And when did this happen?
About eight and a half months ago.
Exactly.
What's with this divinetie?
Are you colour-blind
or did your wife give it to you?
I'm writing a piece
on the fashion industry.
No, no. It's an old one.
No, no, please. I'm in a hurry.
I am not any more of any interest for
The New York Times
because I just stopped working.
On the contrary,
I'd love to talk to you even more.
The piece I'm writing...
Where are you going?
To the airport.
There's a fashion show
at the airport?
No, I have to meet someone.
Will I see you for dinner?
I'll be here working.
I don't know how long I'll be.
Thank you.
How about right here? This is good.
It's good.
I think this is...
Yeah, but it's mine I'm looking for.
This big one coming up is mine.
All right, that's one.
Now, I've got... I don't think that's mine.
Do you know what
my luggage looks like?
Yeah.
-Are you sure it was green?
-Yes, I'm sure it's green, darling.
It's green, it's brown, it's big.
-Where are you from?
-From Texas.
I love that accent. I love it. So courtly.
-And you're from Vogue magazine?
-Would you say, "Thank you, ma'am"?
-Would you just say that for me once?
-This guy's cracking me up.
Well, maybe later.
He knows the Polaroids are not
supposed to travel in the box, okay?
I could be in the hotel by now.
-Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay, it's okay.
Are you all right?
I lost my suitcase.
Well, you just report it over there
to lost luggage.
-No.
-The baggage...
Well, it's not that.
I left it in the airport bar in Houston.
That's where I came in from.
I'm scared to fly,
so I went in there to get my courage,
if you know what I mean.
Would you read the tags, darling?
Thank you so much.
Hey!
Viviene. Let's just pick up our own...
You know, they'll find it.
That's what they're very good at,
and all you have to do is just tell them,
you know.
It's nice of you to say that, you know.
It's nice of you to care.
Because, you see,
I don't speak French.
That's the thing, I don't speak French.
Well, high school, but, you know,
that doesn't really count.
And, you know, I don't even know
the French word for "baggage."
It's bagage. Just like it's baggage.
Bagage.
You got the cards ready?
Are you ready?
We need a longer cord on this thing.
This is irritating me.
Olivier de la Fontaine.
Try to find out why he's here.
-Hello, Olivier!
-Hi, Kitty.
What a pretty tie.
And it's got kitties on it.
-And I'm Kitty!
-Funny.
Let me guess.
A Charvet?
Or Dior?
-No,Dior, naturellement.
-Bingo!
This is Kitty Potter
at Charles de Gaulle Airport
where what I like to
call the international intelligentsia
of fashion in all its many mutations
is arriving all around me.
Are we expecting
someone special here today?
Special?
Special.
Le tout Paris has been
buzzing about a lollapalooza
called Liza, and her definite, maybe,
appearance on the runway at Chanel.
And I know that she is due any minute.
Any possibility that
you might be here for her?
Well, I'm here to welcome
the press and the retailers.
I'm here to welcome you, Kitty.
Welcome.
I think it's going to be a great season.
Well, we all know how
Liza just loves the spotlight,
so I was just wondering if maybe
you could give us a little...
Just shed some light on
that subject for us.
Olivier?
Olivier, sir?
Our new facilities, I think, are sublime.
It's a giant step forward
for the Paris fashion.
The designers are thrilled.
-Well, I bet they are.
-Will you excuse me?
Well, there he goes.
With the absolute poise
of an architect's desk lamp.
Are you here for the prêt-à-porter?
I'm with The Houston Chronicle.
I'm the assistant fashion editor.
My boss was supposed to come,
but she got sick, a stroke, actually.
I didn't have time for breakfast.
I had to change my shirt
to wear this ridiculous tie.
And here we have the Paris troika,
the three powers that be
in the world of magazine editing.
The unflinchingly fabulous Sissy
Wanamaker of Harper's Bazaar.
-Hi, Sissy.
-Hello, Kitty. Hello.
The unstoppably sophisticated
Nina Scant from British Vogue.
Good Lord, I've never heard myself
described like that before.
Hello, hello.
And the relentlessly artistic
Regina Krumm from Elle.
-Hey.
-Hey.
Welcome to Paris, girls.
-What kind is it?
-Ham.
There's no ham in Moscow.
I have the best art director
in a decade, maybe ever.
The best photographers,
the top, top models, the best writers,
the best editors...
But I think I hear
Elle's bells right behind you.
Operative word being "behind."
I'm not really interested in
jockeying for position.
I just think we're going through
an incredibly exciting, vital time at Elle.
A lot of articles about sex
nowadays, in Elle.
I think they're interesting.
They're very diverting, both magazines,
but I still think Vogue
is the final word, Kitty.
I think you'll have
to agree with me there.
-I have to go!
-Oh, don't go. Oh, don't go.
Follow me to my car, please.
I suppose you don't remember me.
Major Hamilton.
Marshall Field's, Chicago.
Fashion director.
-Oh, yes. Yes.
-It's good seeing you.
I have a little bit of time.
Would you like a quick interview?
We really don't do
unscheduled interviews.
-Mr O'Brannigan, would you mind...
-I don't mind.
-Are you sure?
-...answering a few questions?
Milo. Milo. One minute. One minute.
-Hi. How are you?
-I'll be here if you need me.
-Kitty Potter. Kitty Potter.
-How you doing?
-Yeah.
-Are we ready? Are we rolling?
This is Milo O'Brannigan,
the most sought-after fashion
photographer in the business today.
Milo, you've had a lock on the look
of the '90s for decades now.
How have you managed
to stay on top of everything?
Probably the same way you have, Kitty.
Just hard work
and believing in yourself, right?
Taking advantage
of other people's insecurities.
Anyway, we'll show it to Pilar.
So, does your mother believe
in the old adage
that some women dress for men,
but most women
dress for other women?
You know, my mother makes dresses
to celebrate a woman's body.
Dressing for men has never
particularly interested her.
Although she's certainly
undressed for a few of them.
So what if I have big feet?
You know, the main difference between
men and women in fashion is this,
women make dresses for themselves
and for other women.
A man makes clothes for a woman
he wants to be with
or, as in most cases,
for the woman he wants to be.
-Are you married?
-I'm married to Dane.
Come over here, honey.
Dane. Earth to Dane.
Jack, try and be a little bit nice.
This is my wife, Dane.
These are her famous legs.
And this is her famous sister, Kiki.
-Hello. Fiona, New York Times.
-Hey. How's it going?
-Fiona. How do you do?
-Hi, I'm Dane. Charmed.
They share the same father, or at
least that is what their agent tells us.
I made these clothes for your old body,
and now you couldn't fit into them
if I asked you to.
-I mean, am I crazy? Am I crazy?
-Cy, it was not her fault.
-Or what?
-It's not my fault!
It's not a fault, you faggots!
You woman haters!
It's great! It was a big shock!
Albertine, you could
have told me, right?
-You could have called me.
-I was in Germany.
I am crazy, I am crazy!
Or did the goddamn Germans
invent the telephone?
They invented worse, okay?
I wasn't really sure
I was going to keep it.
Look, you gotta be
eight and a half months pregnant.
I mean, if I was Lacroix,
if I was that thief Lagerfeld,
you would've called me, right?
We'll get Eve. They are the same size.
I hate her fucking tattooed head.
-You're bald.
-Aren't I?
Violetta.
-I can't deal with this girl.
-Well, I'll get rid of her.
Albertine. Albertine's the one I want.
Why can't I have Albertine?
Albertine is pregnant.
The agency said she was pregnant.
Pregnant is not my silhouette
this season.
-I know.
-I mean,
it is not, it is not, it is not.
My bulge is in the bustle out at
the back, not in the bulge up front.
Bald tattoo is not part of my vision.
It's beyond déjà vu.
Freezing out here.
Go, see what's wrong
with this traffic.
We must talk about your wife.
What's my wife got to do with you?
You shouldn't eat so fast.
Stop him! He's a murderer!
Stop!
-What?
-Pilar...
-Are you joking?
-...the two greys is not good, you know.
-Pilar.
-Hold on, please.
-Simone.
-Why there is no music today here?
-Simone, it's important.
-Okay, I'm coming.
Oh, your smoke, Pilar.
You're killing us.
Murdered?
Jack.
Put on the news.
He was here.
Olivier's been murdered.
...Olivier de la Fontaine,
Head of the Fashion Council,
What?
has been murdered...
What?
What happened?
Does his wife know yet?
My condolences.
Your husband has died.
What a pity.
Your Papa has died.
I'm sorry to bring you
this terrible news.
But my dog and I are very happy.
We hated him.
We're coming to you live from
the historic Pont Alexandre in Paris,
where Olivier de la Fontaine...
Eyewitnesses report a stocky man,
possibly in his mid-60s...
...fleeing the scene by plunging...
This is a shocking prelude
to the spring prêt-à-porter collections,
the glittering spectacle
Olivier de la Fontaine
choreographed each season
for a cast of thousands.
I saw...
Did she take photos?
So, you took photographs?
-Can I have the roll?
-Yes.
I want a receipt.
Okay, you give... You give your name.
And he just jumped off the bridge.
Just like that. He just jumped off.
-Yeah, well, no. It was totally bizarre.
-Yeah.
-Completely strange. Bizarre.
-I mean, I saw the whole thing.
F-I-O-N-A.
-Could you identify the guy?
-All white people look alike to me.
How can you tell him apart
from your boss if it's true?
By his clothes. How do you think?
That's how I tell everybody apart.
How much longer?
Miss, how much longer?
Checkout time is 12:00.
Well, that's an hour
and twenty minutes.
You're not telling me I have to wait
an hour and twenty minutes, are you?
Come on, come on.
Set up right around here. Right here.
It should be fine.
Yeah, I'm checking out. I'm Joe Flynn.
Clint. Clint.
Will you do your interview
with Kitty Potter?
I promised I'd give you
an interview. Absolutely.
-Slim. Slim, hey.
-Oh, hello, Kitty.
Mr Flynn, there is a phone call
for you from Washington.
Am I invisible? I've been standing here
for a half an hour!
You can use the phone
on the desk right there.
All right.
Hello?
Hi. I'm Anne Eisenhower
from The Houston Chronicle.
I should have a reservation.
And the only person still living
who can give Saint Laurent colour tips.
Slim, we've missed you so very much
since you retired from Vogue.
Really?
I'm a sports reporter, for Christ's sake.
I don't know dick about fashion.
You're all we got there, Joe.
Matthews wants this tomorrow...
For God's sake, I gotta leave Paris.
You gotta use the fucking wire.
This is a big story.
What's so special about this dead guy?
-Fashion. He's a...
-What's his name?
-Who?
-The dead guy!
De la Fontaine.
Olivier de la Fontaine. Got that?
Yeah, right. And do me a favour.
Call my wife.
She's not going to believe me.
Fucking cocksucker!
New ball game. I'm not checking out.
I'm not checking out.
No, I'm not checking out.
I'm not leaving, I'm staying.
But you can't.
-This is my room.
-This lady has just checked in.
This is my room.
You'll have to find
the lady another room.
-I'm sorry.
-Well, I'm sorry.
There is no other room.
Excuse me, you clearly don't
understand. This is my room.
-You have a problem. Sorry.
-You don't understand
-the day I've had. I lost my luggage.
-You don't understand.
I haven't checked out.
See, I have not checked out.
Well, do we have any fashion plans
or projects in the wings anywhere?
Well, I think you'll find out about them
when the time is right.
But now I want you to meet
somebody very, very special.
Clint, come over here. Over here.
Clint Lammeraux, meet Kitty Potter.
-I don't care about your luggage!
-I have to cover
the fashion show.
You know, this is my...
You'll have to find the lady
another room. I'm sorry. Hey...
Do I smell oil?
-Excuse me.
-Where's my bag? Where's my bag?
If you don't find my bag soon,
you're going to hear
from The Washington Post!
-2326. Hey! -...just a little
of this and a little of that.
Hey!
Yes, especially that.
Cotton, pharmaceuticals, you name it.
Cobras, pythons, rattlesnakes,
ring lizards...
Oh, shit.
Hey! Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me in!
I'm on this line.
Yes, this is Joe Flynn.
Listen to me
if you want to keep your job.
Listen... I you my baggage
and I you this bitch
in my room, now!
What do you mean
you don't have my bagage?
I know goddamn well
you have my bagage!
If you think you can smoke me out
of here with that cock and bull story,
you're as full of shit
as a Christmas goose.
As full of merdeas a canard de...
Yes, hello, this is Anne Eisenhower.
As in General Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Yes, that's correct.
Ex-president Dwight D. Eisenhower.
No, I know he's not registered here!
I am!
No, I don't want to talk
to the manager again.
I have talked to the manager.
I want the owner.
I think this hotel is owned by Sony
or some Japanese company.
I wonder what time it is in Tokyo?
I wonder how long it will take them to
get you out of my room, Mr Joe Flynn!
Oh, thank you.
Would you help me with these bags?
-Of course.
-Check them here.
Sorry.
I believe you have a reservation
for a Louise Marshall?
-Marshall?
-Field.
Louise Field.
-Would you sign that, please?
-Of course.
Major.
Good-looking guy, huh?
Well, bonjour.
And I'm standing here
with the one, the only Elsa Klensch.
Thank you, Kitty. How are you?
-How are you doing?
-I'm fine, darling.
Thank you so much for doing this.
What's going on in fashion
for the '90s?
Well, this is the most important time,
the most important week in fashion.
This is where everything happens,
really, for the year.
Let me ask you this, did you get
any good scoops this morning?
Yes, but...
She's saving it for her own show, folks.
What the hell is this?
Operator.
Splendid Hotel, please.
-Hello?
-Louise?
-Yes.
-God damn it, Louise!
You left a pair of skivvies
in my suitcase.
You gotta be careful about that stuff.
I don't know how that happened.
I'm very sorry
and I won't let that happen again.
I'll be much more careful.
I'm sorry.
And listen, since when
are you so talkative?
You were talking to everybody
at the airport.
-I didn't talk to anyone, honey.
-You even started to talk to me.
-Hardly anyone at all.
-You would have blown our cover.
We gotta be careful, honey.
Very, very careful.
-You understand?
-I'm very sorry.
I will be more careful. Okay?
My darling, do you miss me?
-How was Milan?
-Well, I'll tell you.
I got the surprise of my life there.
You know, I know a lot about fashion,
and we all know that
short skirts are back,
and short skirts are going to be back
for the rest of the '90s.
That's my bet.
Well, I've seen pleated skirts.
I saw A-line skirts.
I saw sarong skirts, but then suddenly
the pouf skirt emerged.
Now, you must remember
Lacroix's pouf skirt?
We were poufed, and poufed,
and poufed?
Well, it could be that
we're gonna be poufed again
before the turn of the century.
Will you be poufed?
I doubt it.
Stop. Stop.
I'm just going to take a look.
Stop.
What suite is Regina Krumm in?
Regina? Faust Suite.
-Foest?
-Yes, Faust Suite.
-You mean Faust.
-Faust Suite!
-The Faust Suite.
-Yes, Faust Suite.
Oh, that's supposed to be my suite.
What suite is Nina Scant in?
The Solomon Suite.
-Solomon. You mean the Salomé Suite.
-The Salomé Suite.
That's the suite
that I'm supposed to be in.
-Well, this is your suite.
-No, no, this is not my suite.
This is the Faust Suite.
I'm supposed to be
in the Salomé Suite.
I'm not in this Salomé Suite.
You get on the phone right now.
Get on the phone and tell them
that I want to be in the Faust Suite.
It's the one I asked for.
I don't want to be in the Salomé Suite.
This is the wrong suite.
I'm supposed to be
in the Salomé Suite.
You're supposed to be
in the Salomé Suite.
And you just set those things
down, down.
Put everything down.
Just put it down,
because this is not my suite.
-Regina.
-Nina.
-Oh, my God. Here we are again.
-Here we are again.
It's unbelievable. It seems like
we were here just a second ago.
I know, I feel like I have déjà vu.
Can you believe
the construction in this city?
-No, it's wild.
-What are they doing?
Well, it must be
an awful lot of maintenance
-in a city like this, mustn't it?
-Oh, my God.
The plaster dust, you know, it just
goes right up my nostrils.
-It's incredible.
-Yes, it's horrid. Isn't it?
Now, are you going
to the embassy tonight?
Yes, of course.
Well, my darling, I shall see you there.
-Get some rest.
-Bye, darling.
Come with us.
Let's see.
Who's this?
Chauffeur.
We can't see his face.
That's him. That's the man.
See? That's his coat.
His pants.
We know what he wore.
We don't know who he is.
We are coming to you live from
the historic Pont Alexandre in Paris
where Olivier de la Fontaine,
head of La Chambre Syndicale
de la Mode et de la Haute Couture,
which is
French fashion's governing body,
has been murdered
in the back of his limousine.
Eyewitnesses report a stocky man,
possibly mid-60s, exited the car
as it stopped in traffic,
fleeing the scene by plunging
headlong into the Seine.
He's believed drowned.
If not, he has surely died of pollution.
Excuse me.
This is a shocking prelude
to the prêt-à-porter collection,
the glittering spectacle
Olivier de la Fontaine
choreographed each season
for a cast of thousands.
This was Sandra de la Notte
for Sky News.
From the Sky Satellite Network,
-this is Sky News.
-Are you still here?
It's going to be a group designer photo.
Most everybody's going to be there.
All the designers are going to be there?
Pretty much everybody.
I've got Cerruti, Rykiel,
Westwood, Montana, Agnès B.
You don't know these people.
Well, they said
they're going to be there.
Simone Lo will probably not be there.
She may not even show her collection.
Are you serious?
-Simone is a greedy bitch!
-Cort.
-Don't say such things.
-It's true.
Simone Lo's collection is little more
than crematorium couture. Dead.
-How about Gaultier?
-Yeah.
He's very enthusiastic.
-But you like his work.
-I used to.
At the beginning of his career
when he was my little protégé.
Lately he's gone off in a direction
I don't think I can entirely approve of.
You mean like Cy Bianco?
Why would you want to dredge up
his recycled name?
It seems that they're both
influenced by the street.
Oh, what street? Bond?
Or Camden Lock?
-Where's Mother?
-I think she's in her office.
-Mother?
-Don't say anything, Jack.
Just get out and close the door.
No, no, I don't want that black thing.
No, please.
I don't think I'm going to be home
tonight, honey.
My mother wants me to stay with her.
-I wonder who's the father?
-Father?
You know, Albertine's baby.
Well, it's not me.
Oh, really?
Dane, I'm going to try to catch a ride
with your old man.
-I'll catch you later, all right?
-That's nice of him.
There's no downside.
Milo O'Brannigan's the photographer.
You can't do better than that.
He's the best.
He will make you all look great.
And you'll be, what, with your friends.
-That's not...
-He shoots quick.
-Is it wrong?
-It's definitely not wrong.
-Milo, huh?
-Yeah, Milo.
-He's the best.
-How'd you get him?
-You sleep with him or what?
-No.
I don't sleep with men.
Where is Mr Lammeraux?
Jack, wait till you see these boots.
One for every mood.
Too cool.
-Clint, how are you?
-Hi, Jack.
It's been such a long time since
Christmas. How is Ann?
-She said to say hi.
-She is absolutely charming.
Do you know Ann Richards?
I introduced you to her.
Remember me?
-Eve, Clint Lammeraux.
-Hi, Eve.
Eve, Slim Chrysler.
Why don't you try those on?
Women's Wear Daily is
going to love these, and Simone too.
I'm not so sure about that.
Simone has her own taste.
How's that?
Well, Slim was just saying that
my mother is really going to love
these boots. She's going to love them.
Well, it's nice of you to say so,
but I'm just a simple Irish country boy
who loves his work.
Listen, I know your contract
with Vogue is almost up.
-March 31st.
-Is it?
I never bother with that business stuff.
I'll get somebody to check it out.
Let me give you
another glass of champagne.
Milo, me old darling.
Hello.
I'm here for a slightly
premature celebration.
Remember the information
that I imparted to you
about my imminent megabucks deal
in the States?
Well, it's about to come to fruition.
You know I want you
to be my right-hand man.
We're going to blow Vanity Fair
out of the fucking water, darling.
And my friend at The New Yorker says
Tina is shitting herself.
-Regina.
-Hi.
I'm sorry, I thought this was
Gérard Depardieu's suite.
-What's that?
-Dog shit.
It brings good luck.
He never looked better.
Let's go.
Mrs de la Fontaine, my condolences.
Please, would you... Would you please
answer to a few questions?
It's no secret here in Paris that your
husband was involved with Simone Lo.
-How do you feel about that right now?
-Where is the car?
Please open the door.
Is it true that your husband
was in financial turmoil?
Did you know your husband
had enemies?
What are you going to do now?
Thank you, Mrs...
Thank you, Mrs de la Fontaine.
My condolences. Okay, come here.
This is Sandra de la Notte reporting.
There she is! Simone Lowenthal.
Mrs Lowenthal! Mrs Lo! Mrs Lo...
Please, could you answer
a few quick questions?
-Please, leave me alone.
-For Sky News, please.
What was your relationship
with the victim before the murder?
-Please, leave me alone, please.
-Did you have quarrels with his wife?
Would you please tell me
about your collection, please?
What was your relationship
with the victim?
Why don't you ask his widow?
Who do you think could have done
such a horrible thing?
These bizarre circumstances have...
These bizarre circumstances have cast
a strange pall over fashion week
here in Paris,
where it's difficult to eclipse
the epic drama of the prêt-à-porter.
Ironically, the controversial figure
at the centre of it all has done just that.
That's it.
Well, I'll call with something
on the coroner's report tomorrow.
Isabella!
Close the door.
Isabella.
You know, they said it was a man
who murdered him.
I would have guessed his wife.
Oh, please. Simone's better off
without him anyway.
-So is his wife.
-Kiki.
Did you ever sleep with him?
Get out of here.
No, I wouldn't do that to Simone.
Why, are you trying
to tell me something?
Not quite. I have to go. I'm cooking.
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.
Hi, honey. Who was that on the phone?
Only your wife.
Want some wine?
No, I shouldn't.
Hello.
Yes, this is Anne Eisenhower.
Yes. Yes, well...
You know, that's just
completely unacceptable, I'm afraid,
because I have to have my bag.
Well, I filled out the form,
and everything's there.
Just... If you could just
please keep looking.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
This is Kitty Potter, and I'll be in Paris,
guaranteeing you
that I'm going to bring you a drama.
I thought you said you didn't drink.
I said I shouldn't drink.
-Well, cheers.
-Thank you.
These French really know
how to make wine.
Why don't we just go ahead
without Simone?
Well, guys, I'm fed up waiting.
I'm gonna do this now, all right?
-Are you charged up?
-Yeah. You ready?
You're ready. Okay.
Hi. So, hope you're all well.
You look lovely.
I'm just going to do
this shot now, okay?
The important thing is,
I'm gonna count to three,
when I say three,
that's when the shot is going to be.
So I want you to keep your eyes
wide open, you know.
No blinking, okay?
Focus on the camera when I say three,
all right?
Here we go. Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.
What about the champagne glasses?
-Milo, she's here.
-I'm sorry I'm late.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Winnie, pull her into the centre.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Simone.
Now, on the count of three,
I want you to look over here, all right?
-Okay, I'm sorry, Milo.
-Okay.
Excuse me, I'm trying to work. Set.
Okay, and again, over here, please.
One, two, three.
This is Kitty Potter,
reporting live on the first day
of the fall 1994 Paris collections.
The remarkably well-preserved crowd
of fashion folk you see around me
look as though they're about to break
into the Bonjour, Paris number
from Funny Face, don't they?
But in reality,
they're headed for the trenches.
Fashion, my friends, is war.
A week from now these editors,
journalists, photographers and retailers
will wear their battle scars much as
they do their huge Prada handbags
and their Vivienne Westwood
platform shoes as chic accessories.
Even a wisp of iron
like Regina Krumm,
the Lilliputian editor of Elle magazine,
is here for the blood sport.
With 86 collections to view,
vision blurs and judgement
is occasionally impaired.
Wearing dark glasses
can't stop it, either.
There will be great lapses in taste.
But there will also be
dazzling moments of rare beauty.
And I'll be everywhere at once.
That's Kitty Potter keeping you posted.
-That's got a bad stain on it.
-Okay.
Whither the couturier in his métier,
you ask,
and I answer, right here backstage
at Christian Lacroix,
the artiste from Arles,
the saviour of ready-to-wear deluxe.
Christian, it was
such a beautiful collection.
Thank you.
And so perfect.
What was perfect for you this morning?
Perfection for me?
It doesn't exist. Never.
In fashion, we are never satisfied.
Well, let me ask you something.
The photo prints of the models
and the faces were just wonderful.
How did you come up with that idea?
Now the fashion is starting from
the medias, from magazines
and from models.
And I wanted to put them in the street.
Because I want people
to be a little disturbed,
and they don't know
where is reality, fashion,
and magazine media, models, girls,
real girls.
I wanted to mix up all of that.
Is she going ahead with the show?
Well, of course.
It is our business, after all.
Will she actually be there herself?
Sonia, it's nice of you to come.
How's Simone?
We're so sorry.
This is such a tragedy.
The Rykiels are here.
Everything is okay?
Nice of you to come.
We just came to give you a hug.
Bernell, it's Anne, and I'm just calling
to say everything is great in Paris.
I'm in the hotel. I got all the schedules,
all the invitations, and, so, that's it.
If you need to call me, just remember
the time change. Okay, bye.
You know, this is a really unusual
circumstance, and I just...
I just hope that you can
forget about last night.
I have a little problem
with alcohol, and...
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.
I just... I hope that you can be
a gentleman and that we can just say
what happened last night
never happened, okay?
Sure. No problem.
-No problem? Really?
-Yeah, whatever you want.
Just forgotten, like that. It's so easy.
-Yeah.
-That's great.
What? What, am I supposed
to be crushed or something?
No. No! No, this is... This is great.
This is just great. You know?
-Yeah. That's great.
-Come on, don't change the channel!
Come on! Hey, hey, hey. Come on,
give me back the channel changer.
Simone.
That's very nice.
-But isn't it your show today?
-That's not important.
Our concern is for our friends.
Business will take care of business.
I am so sorry for you.
I can feel your pain.
Simone, I have to be honest with you.
Olivier and I were never great friends.
But you know that. But to be murdered,
strangled by a maniac...
It makes my flesh crawl.
But you, you poor, poor dear,
you are truly the bravest woman
in Christendom.
You're so kind. Really.
Where's my crew?
Where's my camera? There you go.
I'm standing here with
the handsomest man I know.
Monsieur Gianfranco Ferré,
the Italian designer in residence at
the venerated old French house
of Christian Dior.
-Yeah.
-Gianfranco...
-Such refinement.
-Thanks a lot, Kitty.
You speak Italian so well.
Such refinement.
What inspired you this time?
Well, it's the energy that
a woman needs in these times.
I try to do my best. I love women.
I like to make fantasies with women.
But I always figure what she does,
how she moves,
which way she can move.
But she can make her wardrobe
with different pieces
without throwing them away
season after season.
Sure, she can make
her own new tradition
with the freedom that she needs.
Simone!
I know this has been
a great shock to you.
You lost your man.
And I know you're not going to
want to hear what I've got to say,
but Olivier,
he was not a nice man.
There, I've said it. It's over, it's done,
it's finished, it's gone.
I mean,
I could tell you stories about him
that would make you want to scream.
God knows you're better off
without that man.
I mean, he did not deserve you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
He did not deserve you.
Believe me. You'll get over him.
You're a strong woman. Right?
Yes. I'm a strong woman.
Keep the change.
Hi.
Do you have this in larger sizes?
This green?
-It's beautiful.
-Yes. It is a medium.
-A 14 or an 18? Big. It stretches, right?
-Yes. Is this for you?
The number of the coroner.
Look, no...
I need the telephone figure
of coroner,
the man of dead.
Mister, I am dead. Where is I am?
Imagine.
I am dead. Where is...
Hey, that's my jacket.
-That's your jacket?
-That was my jacket.
That guy had my jacket on.
That must have been the guy
that took my suitcase.
So, Issey Miyake stole your suitcase?
No, not... The chequered thing.
It was my jacket.
I don't know that Issey Miyake's
really your way to go.
Chequered?
I think JC Penney is
more your designer.
The inspector and I
were very surprised
to learn that the victim was an
important figure in the fashion world.
And that he was not
very well liked.
It's true. He wasn't well liked.
In fact, everybody hated him.
Even you, Madame?
No. I didn't like him very much.
They say he was your lover.
What's that got to do
with anything?
He wasn't a very nice person.
...sycophant and a purple panderer.
Storming out of Pamela Harriman's
dinner party at the American Embassy
only last Tuesday, prompting
The New York Post headline,
"Simone, how Lo can you go?"
Jack Lowenthal, son of the designer,
wrested control of the business
in 1990.
Stay here.
I'll just be gone for a moment.
Simone.
Simone. I know this must be
a very awkward time for you,
but I so wanted to introduce
Clint Lammeraux to you.
Clint is a gigantic fan of yours.
In Texas we think of Simone Lowenthal
the same way we think of longhorns.
How nice.
Everyone hated the victim. That
should make our investigation easier.
Or more difficult.
Are you contradicting me?
No, sir. I'm only trying to help.
Well, don't.
-Clint, come over here.
-How interesting.
-What's interesting?
-Your shoes.
-Is that new?
-No, I've had them for years.
Speaking of shoes,
Clint has a gift for you.
Made in Texas by Texans.
You put my logo on these boots?
But who gave you the permission?
Sorry, I'm in your seat.
-My condolences.
-Thank you.
-Nicola?
-Kitty, nice to see you.
Wonderful to see you.
I don't think we've seen each other
since the Volpi ball in Venice.
-Yes, I remember.
-Well, what's going on at Trussardi's?
How about doing a little
interview with us? We're rolling?
Tell us about
the new Trussardi attitude, Nicola.
No interview, Kitty. Thank you.
-Nicola, just one word. Just one word.
-No, thank you.
Shit.
Has anybody seen Violetta?
You excite me so.
I want you so much.
I want you to make me burst.
I can't wait to be with you.
What are you doing talking on
the telephone at a time like this?
For God's sakes, Violetta,
we're about to start.
I was only talking to my mother.
Your mother? Your mother is in Algeria.
You're talking to Africa
at a time like this?
-Beautiful.
-You like that?
I like that. Yes.
This is your best one yet, you know.
-Thanks, Eve.
-No doubt. No doubt about it.
It's wonderful. I like it.
Who were you talking to on the phone?
-Who, me?
-Yeah, yeah,
just now, you were talking to
somebody on the phone, right?
Yes. Yes, I was.
She's cute.
Yeah, well, who were you talking to
on the phone right now?
Who was that?
You know what?
I love you when you are jealous.
-Excuse me. I think... I do believe...
-I'm sorry.
I do believe. Well, hello.
-Hello.
-How are you? My name's Kitty Potter.
-Nice to see you.
-Nice to see you as well.
I'm very upset. It was so sudden.
I'm so... Also, I'm very sad for Simone.
The reaction I have
is absolutely personal
and I can't talk about it on TV.
I'm not happy. I'm just...
I just think that the Earth does not cry.
I saw him just, like, two weeks ago
and he was looking all right.
I think it's sad also
because of the organisation.
I have a show starting
in a couple of minutes.
Here's the designer
and his wife, Violetta,
revelling in post-show euphoria.
Violetta, Cort, it was great.
It was out of this world.
We'll never see it again.
Congratulations. Thank you.
Congratulations.
Hello, darling. Unbelievable.
A wonderful show. What about
the shapes? Are they feminine?
Well, Kitty, I think that my ideal woman
has a bust, waist, and hips,
and she's not shy of her shoulders.
I think shoulders are very fresh again.
And, of course, legs.
She doesn't have to have legs,
but it's wonderful if she does.
Don't you think?
And it seems that she's also got...
Excuse me.
I'm putting this in your pocket.
I think you should read it,
and then I think you should call me.
Oh, my Lord, Albertine!
God, it's hot in there.
Harry Belafonte! Harry!
Give it to me.
Mr Belafonte, can we do
an interview with Kitty Potter?
-Hey.
-Hi, how are you?
-Remember me?
-Yes, I do.
Great. Could we do that interview now?
Do you mind?
-Yeah, sure.
-Are we rolling?
I'm standing here with a gentleman
who needs no introduction, I believe.
-Hi.
-What brings you to Paris?
I'm here doing a film.
It's about Ronald Reagan
becoming president again.
Nancy Reagan is running
a secret government.
Ollie North is Secretary of
Health and Human Resources.
And Sidney Poitier
is playing the part of
a black guy who takes over
American Express.
What's going on?
Give her some room. Give some air!
Bedlam has broken out here,
backstage at Cort Romney's show.
Isabella de la Fontaine has fainted.
She has lost consciousness.
Is she dead? Is she dead?
No, she just fainted. She's okay.
She isn't dead. She is not dead.
I don't know her condition.
Has somebody called the medics?
I didn't order that.
A gift from the management.
What?
A compliment of the... Yeah. Okay.
Listen, listen.
You know where my laundry is?
My clothes, the laundry?
...clothes. Things taken from different
places and putting them together
and adding a little life...
Laundry?
-No, not quite.
-Everything's close to the body.
You believe in a very vivid line.
Yeah, I like, you know,
to express the body. You know.
Tight so it expresses an individual
spirit in everybody, you know.
Thank you for joining me with Style.
I'm Elsa Klensch.
Isabella de la Fontaine
is in stable condition,
stable condition.
She's being examined here right now,
right now by a team of fashion doctors,
here at the site of Cort Romney's show.
Madame de la Fontaine had
just rocked the fashion world
by taking her husband's symbolically
vacant seat in the front row,
wearing what fashion observers
could only speculate
to be a vintage Dior dress, we think.
Until his untimely death,
Olivier de la Fontaine was commonly
known to be involved with
Simone Lowenthal for most of
the duration of the marriage.
Here she is right now,
and she's looking mighty fine to me!
Hello, who made your dress?
Garter belt. Garter belt of lace?
And camisole?
And do you have a lace bra?
With cute panties?
Very nice. The belt.
Very nice accessories.
Yes, this one is very good.
Accessories. Accessories.
No, he doesn't even suspect.
But he's such a bitch! I mean,
he's snooping through all of my things,
he's going through my pockets.
He says we have to be careful.
Of course, I'm going to get rid of him.
I just have to wait till
after the collection, okay?
-I love you.
-I love you, too. Bye.
Could we do a little thing here?
Do you mind?
-Okay.
-Okay.
Okay. Can we just have this right here?
Thank you, thank you.
Anyway, I'm with the man
who gave us fetish fashions.
He gave us pierced nipples and...
I can't say that.
I don't think I can say that.
Anyway, tell me your ideas on beauty.
Would you, please?
I think there is not only one idea
of beauty, I think there is
a lot of different kind of beauty.
And it's exactly what I try to show
in my different collection. You know,
that there is different people
coming from different parts,
that has not the profile, Greek profile,
or something like that,
but can be beautiful.
I try to show, like, a kind of a tolerance
where is that, you know, to be different,
you can be, and to be proud about it,
and to live like that.
Well, you've heard it here
from the wizard of our Oz,
Jean Paul Gaultier.
And I'm Kitty Potter with FAD.
So, I got your note.
Well, I sort of had to resort to that,
you know.
You're so hard to get to
with all those people around you.
Would you like cream or milk
with your tea?
No, I don't like tea.
Well, that's fine. We can just
get right to the point, Milo.
-May I call you Milo, Mr O'Brannigan?
-Sure. Love the way you say it.
Sounds just like me old mother.
Warms the cockles of my heart.
You know what I want to talk about,
don't you?
Haven't the foggiest.
But I love surprises.
And I love your work.
I want you to sign with Elle.
I'll get you everything you want.
I'd stake my job on it.
-Would you, now?
-Yes, I would.
And more than that.
What could be more than that,
Miss Krumm?
Well, let's see, I would
get down on my hands and knees
if I thought it would help.
Well, you never know. It might help.
I beg your pardon?
Well, you said would it help if you got
down on your hands and knees?
And I said,
"Well, you never know, it might help."
It might help.
And you think I won't do that,
don't you?
Just you watch me.
Does that make you happy?
What the hell are you doing?
You goddamn idiot!
Cut that out!
Get out! Get the hell out of my room!
You know what you are?
You are a goddamn amateur!
You are the fucking
Irish flavour of the month!
Where are my clothes?
Jack took them.
What do you mean he took them?
Don't ask. Your son is no good.
Okay, Pilar.
-He's driving me crazy.
-Okay. Where are the clothes?
The Milo O'Brannigan shoot.
Shit!
Winnie! Get over here!
What is going on?
I've got dog shit all over me shoe.
Who brought a dog in here?
-None of us.
-Come on, hurry up. Get it off.
That's one of the reasons
we wear these boots.
In Texas you're always
stepping in something.
Take it away and incinerate it.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Milo.
I brought a little present for you there.
Listen, could you clear out of here?
'Cause I want to get this thing done
kind of fast, okay?
Okay. All right, Clint. Clint.
Come on, pay attention. Let's go.
Okay, let's do this.
Hi.
How you doing, Eve? Hey, Kiki.
Could you take your positions, please?
-Sure.
-Let's have a look at this.
Look, you got...
Constant, you got the Polaroids?
Yeah, what're we selling,
hats or boots? Get the hats off.
-The exposition is fine?
-Yeah, yeah, it's all right.
Yeah, that's not bad.
It looks all right, actually.
Okay.
So, listen, you all look gorgeous
and talented and full of sexual allure
and all that kind of stuff.
Which is just as well because
the clothes are kind of boring.
These boots were made for walking.
Okay. Over here, please.
That's okay. Chin up. Over here, yeah.
We're doing fine. Okay,
imagine you're walking around
in fucking Texas
or someplace like that.
This is so fucking now, you know.
Okay, you're John Wayne,
you hate the camera.
Over here. That's good.
That's good. Over here.
Think cowboy, you know.
There. Chin up, please, Gamiliana.
Yeah, very Randolph Scott.
It was good, it was great.
Over here. I like that sullen look.
Okay, that's good.
Keep it there. Hold it. Keep it there.
Okay, merci. Very, very nice.
Here's the taxi. Thank you.
Saint-Germain-du-Prix, s'il vousplaît.
Or is it Saint-Germain-des-Prés?
I don't know.
Toutes les bags.
-2340, s'il vous plaît.
-Pardon?
Vingt-trois quarante,please.
Milo O'Brannigan, s'ilvousplaît.
Sissy Wanamaker, Harper's Bazaar.
Milo.
It's the Wanamaker woman.
Hold on.
It's the woman from Harper's Bazaar,
you know.
-Hi, Miss Wanamaker.
-Sissy.
All right. Sissy.
I was just thinking about you.
-You were?
-Yeah, I was.
Well, I've been thinking
about you, too, Milo.
-Have you now, Sissy?
-Yes, Milo. Yes, I have.
I really have.
-I'll get it.
-No, you don't. I'll get the door.
You get the contract. Where is it?
-Okay, okay. Okay, on the dresser.
-Okay, put it on the bed.
Okay.
Miss, any time you need me,
I'll be there, okay?
Yes, okay. Just go. Just go.
Come on in.
I'm surprised you're alone.
Where's your entourage?
Aren't you scared
to be in a room alone with me?
I am.
How about some champagne?
You got a beer?
A beer. Let me look.
I like beer.
Actually, I prefer it to champagne.
But, you know, when in Rome,
do as the Parisians do.
I like a man who drinks beer.
Actually, my father drank it constantly.
Don't forget, he was part Irish.
How nice. But then,
you do know about lighting, don't you?
Shall we drink out of the glasses
or just drink out of the bottle?
The bottle's fine.
This is ale, but, well,
that's the same as beer, isn't it?
Here's to us.
Shamrock.
You don't know how much
I admire you, Milo.
-Do you, now?
-Yes, I do.
Nice suite. Big bed.
Milo, you're driving me insane.
I'm acting like a three-year-old
teenager, for God's sake.
I'm the editor of a fashion magazine,
and you're the photographer.
But I'm American and I'm so noisy,
and you're so quiet!
So goddamn Irish, I mean,
you're like the quiet man.
I don't know what to do. I want you
to sign this contract and I want you!
So take me!
What are you doing?
God, what are you doing?
You son of a bitch! Get out of here!
Get out of here!
Stop it! Viviene! Viviene!
You son of a bitch!
This is Kitty Potter live from Paris.
And there's a kind of Mad Hatter
magic in the air here tonight,
judging by Nina Scant's
magnificent millinery.
A chic international crowd
is gathering here
at the elegant restaurant Ledoyen
to see a new collection of haute bijoux
from the celebrated jeweller Bulgari.
Why don't you open your eyes?
Arrogant bastard.
This is pure poetry here tonight
with some of the most beautiful jewels
I've ever seen
glittering everywhere you look,
especially on the lovely throat
of Isabella de la Fontaine.
We haven't seen Isabella on the social
circuit for more than 25 years,
and she certainly made absolutely sure
we won't miss her here tonight.
In every great while, Paris
plays host to a glittering evening
so filled with charm and fantasy,
it feels like
you've just walked right to
the other side of the looking glass.
Inside, we'll sit down to the sumptuous
contemporary cuisine
that has earned Ledoyen its
constellation of Michelin stars.
But first, the dessert. Let's go inside
and have a look at the jewellery,
shall we?
I'm here with Paolo Bulgari,
the third generation of a house
which built its name
on preserving and enhancing
the style and workmanship
of the Italian Renaissance,
and the 19th century Roman school
of artisans.
Paolo, the latest collection is
a foray into the subtleties of porcelain.
How did it evolve?
I'll tell you,
about a couple of years ago...
I feel very at home here. It's so great
to be in the middle of all this again.
Every six months, and it flip-flops.
It's something different.
If we meet here,
the car will be available...
You just stay with me.
-Please, I will be a second.
-Viviene, no second.
-Just get over here.
-Porcelain has never been used before.
It's very different.
It's beautiful. Just marvellous.
Thank you so much.
How do you find the jewellery?
"How do you find the jewellery?"
Well, I usually shove my hand
down the back of the sofa.
Hopefully, I come up with something.
I'm talking about the Bulgari
porcelain pieces.
Yes, I know you are. But it's just...
It's such a boring question to ask.
You know, unimaginative.
Can't anyone ask anything serious
every now and again?
Okay. How do you feel that 50 percent
of the world's pollution
is caused by the textile mills?
The person I blame and hate the most
is me, of course.
I'm the one to blame.
It's my fault. I know.
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
It's my fault. I'm the one to blame.
You couldn't help yourself.
-Really?
-Yeah, it was unfair of me.
You're not all that irresistible,
you know.
I did have a little something to do
with this decision. I assure you. Okay.
-I didn't mean it that way.
-It was my choice.
In fact, I'd say you had very
little to do with the decision. Okay?
You are simply a pawn in this game.
Game?
That's great. You're a fucking piece
of work, you know that?
You're telling me you just fall into bed
with the first person
to pour you a glass of wine?
That is just so typical of you to always
go for the really cheap, low...
Always? Always? Wait a second,
I don't know you! I just met you!
-I'm not your fucking husband!
-Well, I'm not your fucking wife!
Who do you think I am?
Well, I'm trying to figure that out!
-Are you?
-Yes, I am!
-Well, don't strain yourself!
-Well, don't worry!
I won't!
Are you going to watch
more of that fashion shit?
No, I'm looking for a soccer game,
you asshole.
Citroën would just like to point out
that the new Xantia is equipped
with a remarkable, unified
passenger safety structure.
-Do you want to dance?
-Yeah.
Xantia. Discover what Citroën
can do for you.
-Cher!
-Hey.
I'm Kitty Potter for FAD,
and this is Cher.
-Hey.
-Hi.
-How are you doing?
-Fine.
Great. You enjoying this party?
We're at the Bulgari party.
-Yes, I am, I'm... Yes.
-In Paris, yes. At Paris. All right.
Would you talk about it for us?
Well, yeah. I actually think that
the whole thing behind
all of this prêt-à-porter
and all of this thing is about
women trying to be beautiful.
None of us are going to look like
Naomi Campbell.
None of us are going to look like
Christy Turlington,
-so, in a way I think it's kind of sad...
-And not many of us are going to
look like you, either, so...
Well, yeah. I don't know, I mean, I'm
a victim as well as a perpetrator of this.
And I think it's not about
what you put on your body.
I think it's more about what you are
on the inside.
-I mean, this is Cher!
-I've never exactly...
We have taken Paris by storm.
By storm, by storm, by storm.
At last. A table and chair.
Madame de la Fontaine.
-Yes?
-May I introduce myself?
-I'm Kitty Potter.
-What a cute name.
-It's not real. It's just for TV.
-Mine is not real either.
No, I know, it was your
husband's name, right?
Not really. Excuse me.
-I love your jewels.
-Thank you.
Hey. Hey. I got a jacket just like that.
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Pardon me.
Hi. I'm Fiona Ulrich.
I'm from The New York Times.
-Hi. How are you?
-Hi.
I just want to... How do you find
this year's collections differing
from last year's?
Well, I don't know.
Let me see the ones of Regina.
Look, she's over there.
She knows we're talking about her.
Milo. Milo O'Brannigan.
He pretty much controls how women
think that they have to look
-in, like, 39 countries.
-Bye, Eve.
I have to run.
-Craig, come on.
-I was just... There was just...
Please, come!
Don't turn around.
Don't look at me.
It's me, Sergio. Your Sergio.
How much time has gone by?
You're more beautiful than ever.
I thought you were convinced
that I was dead.
How many years? Forty, forty-two?
How old were you?
Maybe sixteen years old.
Eighteen, I think.
I was fifteen.
You were my child bride.
We really were husband and wife.
And then...
You left for Moscow
on our wedding night.
We were Communists. Remember?
You were a Communist.
I was only fourteen years old.
Milo, you have to do a book.
A book of tragedy. You have to.
-It's just a hobby, you know.
-It's brilliant.
-I get so bored with the other gig.
-Look at these tired old tits.
-It's just, quelle tragique.
-It's like blackmail, right?
You're gonna blackmail people
or what?
You watch out, Cy,
I might get one of you.
No, I want a print of this one right here.
You're a porno photographer!
Passes the time anyway, you know.
The very day I arrived in Moscow,
Stalin died.
The changes, the confusion,
fears and fright...
I had no way to contact you.
I couldn't telephone.
I couldn't telegraph you.
Time went by.
My own life was in danger.
I had to change my identity.
I gave myself a Russian name.
I'm a tailor like my father.
I started to make clothes...
for the officials
of the new government.
One day, in a French newspaper,
I read that you had married
Olivier de la Fontaine.
My heart broke.
I still love you, and I...
Isabella, I'm so sorry
about the death of your husband.
Thank you very much, indeed.
I want you to take them back
to my hotel. There's my key, okay?
-Okay.
-Bring the key back to me immediately.
-No problem. I'll be back in a minute.
-Okay.
Winnie, tell you what. You can take
a walk. I'll see you tomorrow sometime.
-Do you know that boy?
-Who? Alain! Yes, I know him.
Good. Follow him. Get that key for me.
Bring it back here before he gets back.
Do you understand?
But how?
I don't know how.
That's what you're here for.
Use your brain, your... Your breasts,
anything, but get me that key.
-I don't think he likes girls.
-Well, then, act like a boy.
De la Fontaine was not murdered.
I know, because I was there.
You were there?
And you didn't kill him?
What a shame.
We have to meet.
I'll explain everything.
Tomorrow, at a place
where we won't be recognised.
At the Eiffel Tower.
No, too crowded.
We'll meet at the Rodin Museum.
At ten. At the statue of The Thinker.
But I don't get up before noon.
At twelve, then.
At twelve, I have aerobics.
Well, at four.
Four is good.
It's a surprise. I can't tell you.
Well, I'll meet you later
at the Arc, okay?
It's a surprise. I can't tell you.
Excuse me, everybody. Goodbye.
Slim, I'm going to go see my mother.
I have a headache.
Listen, I have to get going. Sorry.
Honey, I'll speak to you later.
Give my love to Mother, please.
-Cort.
-Bye, sis.
Clint, do you mind
helping me down the stairs?
-No, not at all.
-I think I snapped my heel.
Excuse me, Slim. Call of nature.
-See you, Slim.
-Right.
White or red?
Some rose, please.
Good colour!
Oh, my God. You evil son of a bitch.
Stupid card...
Give me a fucking key. I love keys.
Now, do you have any more of these
wonderful photographs to show me?
Come here, you big gorilla.
You animal.
Did you fart?
I never fart.
Only when I drink champagne.
You're a great shape of a woman,
do you know that?
-Let me get my coat off.
-I'm sick of all these models.
They're like walking implants.
I'm so hot.
Come on and sit down.
Here, do you want a drink?
-God, I'd love one. Lovely.
-Do you like Irish whisky?
-I love it.
-That's the good stuff.
-Can I have a glass, please?
-No, knock it back. You'll love it.
-Great.
-Go on, sit down, relax.
Oh, you know... I just love Ireland.
It's fantastic. It's so beautiful.
We landed in Shannon last year and
we drove around the Ring of Kerry,
which is unbelievably beautiful.
We stayed at a couple of hotels.
They weren't bad.
I think one was in the Relais
& Châteaux, which is my bible.
The people were fantastic.
I mean,
I don't think Irish people are thick.
-I think you're lyrical and...
-Come here, you big animal!
Oh, God. You have no savoir-faire,
Milo. At all.
Come here,
and I'll show you me boudoir.
Where are we going?
We're going to your boudoir.
-I love your use of the language.
-Come here.
Come on, get that Gaultier stuff off you.
What? I'll never get it
over my Philip Treacy hat.
Philip Treacy, the Galway charlatan.
He's a genius.
Fucking photographs!
Stop it! That's enough!
No more! Stop taking fucking
photographs, you animal!
Jesus... I wondered
what that clicking sound was!
You must be gay
if you want me in that position anyway!
You little shit!
Don't take any more fucking
photographs, you... Stop it!
-That's... I'll get the camera off you.
-Good night.
You Irish wanker!
You Irish, you are thick, I take it back!
You're fucking stupid!
And you wouldn't know what to do
with your fucking country
if we gave it back to you!
You bog-runner!
Where's my bag?
Jesus Christ.
Each death seems different.
Yet the results are always the same.
The person no longer lives.
A croissant?
Dead is dead.
When will we know?
Oh, we already know.
What do we know?
We know he is dead.
That I am sure of.
I know we know he is dead.
But why?
Why?
That's a difficult question. Why...
Tomorrow, we will know how.
Tomorrow?
At least we know
the two men had the same taste.
-And how do we know that?
-They wore the same tie.
Dane!
The telephone is ringing!
Dane?
-Hello?
-What happened to my clothes?
What are you doing
with Milo O'Brannigan?
What's going on around here?
-I can explain everything, Mother.
-Oh, I doubt it.
Where have you been all night? Huh?
-Hello?
-I'll call you back, Mother.
I'll call you back.
I want to know
where you've been all night. Dane!
I spent the night with my sister.
How about you?
Hello?
Mr Flynn? This is the concierge.
We have secured a room for you.
I am sending the key right away.
I don't want it.
Is that the laundry,
or our bags, or a room?
My wife.
The bellboy's bringing
the new room key now.
No. No, I don't need it.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.
I don't want it.
I hope you enjoy your stay
at the Grand Hotel.
No, écoutez. Come on, man. Hello?
Excuse me, you're on my cords.
Thank you, my own cameraman.
This is Kitty Potter. Are we rolling?
This is Kitty Potter live in Paris
-with the queen of knit, Sonia Rykiel.
-Thank you, thank you.
It was a wonderfully sensual show.
The collection was beautiful, Sonia.
Please, you speak too quick for me.
Because my English is not too good.
We need a translator here. I think we're
having a little problem right here.
Mr Flynn, here's the key...
No, I don't want it.
to your new room...
What? Are you fucking deaf?
Are you deaf? I don't want it.
But, Mr Flynn, excuse me...
It's your key...
I don't want it. It's not my room.
I don't want it.
Understand? Goodbye. Aurevoir.
All right? Goodbye. Aurevoir.
You're not Mr Flynn?
Goodbye.
-Morning.
-Paper. Great.
Where have you been? I'm Mr Flynn.
Did you bring my key?
Winnie! Where's my coffee?
Do I have to do everything meself?
Jesus Christ.
What happened to the proofs? Winnie!
The proofs!
What happened to the negatives?
Where else would an underground
designer go but underground?
I'm standing in the crush of
Cy Bianco's fans who've gathered
here in an abandoned Metro station to
see what Generation X wants to wear.
-Wait a minute.
-Wait a minute, what?
-There's Cort Romney.
-Wait a minute. Wait. It's Cort Romney,
who professes never to
look at fashion magazines
and never visits anyone else's atelier.
Cort, to what do we owe
this delightful pleasure?
I must've missed my stop.
This obviously isn't
Gare Saint-Lazare, is it?
-No, I don't believe it is.
-I have one more thing to say
to the press in general
and to you, Potty, in particular.
How many G's are there in
"bugger off"? Excuse me.
Well, what an artistic temperament!
At least I'm not fucking
other people's husbands.
So?
Somebody's fucking mine.
I think you're being a bit neurotic.
You don't know that, anyway.
There's nothing neurotic about what I'm
saying. I'm not being overly sensitive.
How do you know? How do you know?
I can smell it on him,
and it smells very close to home.
Any spies out there?
Vogue. Harper's...
Well, wonder who's going
to sign Milo O'Brannigan?
Well, Vogue is very happy that his
contract's up,
so I guess that leaves
a clear track for you two.
Elle's not interested in has-beens.
Really? I would have thought you'd be
on your hands and knees to sign him.
-In fact, I think you were.
-What did he tell you, Sissy?
-Nothing. Just something I saw.
-He showed you pictures of me?
Let's just say I saw them.
I haven't seen yours yet, Nina.
I'm sure they're wonderful.
How do you know that
he took photographs of me?
I was in the room.
What do you mean
you were in the room?
Well, I wasn't actually in the room.
I was in the closet.
He took photographs of all three of us?
-Yes, he did.
-God, he's a misery.
-He's a menace. Psychopath.
-Well, not to worry, girls. Not to worry.
I have the negatives of
the Lammeraux boot shoot.
You sold my company.
You sold me to a Texan shoemaker?
Boots. A very rich bootmaker.
Without my permission?
Without asking me?
But who are you? You know,
you're worse than your father was.
Whoever that was.
You sell and buy everything.
Even your own mother.
I did it for your own good, Mother.
-My own good?
-Yes.
Who decide? A philanderer?
A traitor? A liar?
Shit! Don't you know
we're out of money?
And where are these people?
They're here.
-Here?
-They're outside.
But it's a done thing, Mother.
There is nothing you can do.
I did it for you.
You'll be rich now. You'll be rich.
Okay. Well, let them in.
I want to meet my new boss.
You'll see.
Things will turn out just great.
-Yeah.
-You'll still be the designer,
and we won't have
any more problems about money.
You'll be just like Lagerfeld
or Lacroix, or Ferré.
Isabella!
But, but why?
Why did you contact
my second husband?
I was afraid you wouldn't see me.
So you tried to blackmail him.
Blackmail? Me?
Thank goodness he's dead.
I'm glad you killed him.
I'm really glad.
No, no, I didn't kill him.
I can explain everything.
-Then explain. Explain.
-Well, it's a long story...
Major Hamilton. Marshall Field's
of Chicago. Fashion director.
I want to say what you're doing...
What you're doing is sensational.
It's very adventurous.
You're a real hero.
Of course, it's not right for my place,
you know.
I mean, we're very traditional.
You know, conservative.
But maybe ten years down the line.
Well, it's not for everybody, right?
No, it isn't. But I'll tell you,
the younger employees in my place
all love your stuff.
Where's Cy?
Where the hell’s Cy?
Where's Cy? He went that way.
-Just calm down.
-I'm calm.
Why don't you talk in English?
You think I have an attitude problem?
What the hell are you saying?
What the hell is she talking about?
-Bitch!
-You are the bitch!
What are you doing here?
Slut! How could you, you cunt?
No, you're the cunt!
She's right!
You're a cunt,
you adulterating, mendacious
cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.
Hi, Cy!
Thought you were hiding from us.
Wonderful show, just wonderful.
We loved it. Just loved it.
I'm glad you liked it.
Would you do a little thing with us?
For FAD? Do you mind?
Hi, everybody.
Do you mind if I just get right in here?
Can I have... Okay.
Can we roll? We roll? Okay, let's go.
Hey, everybody.
Kitty Potter coming at you from
Cy Bianco's funking fashion show.
Cy, that was super fine.
Tell us about the collection.
Right, I'm trying to do something
like stocking tops,
and layers, you know. Old clothes.
Taking old clothes from, like, Tati,
different places, and reshaping them
really tight for the youth,
you know. Not so expensive.
-Right.
-Brilliant work.
Absolutely brilliant. You are a pagan.
You are to the '90s what lava lamps
were to the '70s.
It's prêt-à-go-go-go-go-go. It's plastic,
it's rap, it's fabulous, it's Cy.
Lookie, lookie.
This is what I've been waiting for.
No, that's the Rykiel shoot.
Well, where are the proofs?
Yeah, well,
there's a problem with the proofs.
Oh, I was afraid of that. You mean
the boot idea didn't work?
No, the boots worked fine. It's just,
there's a problem with the negatives.
-I'll get that.
-Milo,
are you trying to tell me
the lab fucked up?
No, I'm not trying to tell you the lab
fucked up. But there is a fuck-up
with the negatives.
Well, what am I going to tell Clint?
I mean, you know, he seems very quiet
on the outside,
but he can be a real monster.
Well. What have we here?
A publisher's convention?
Looks like a scene from Macbeth.
Negotiations.
-What did she say?
-She said, "Negotiations."
-But what does she mean?
-I think she means negotiations.
When did that come?
This afternoon. This morning.
-Where was I?
-Sleeping.
My bagage!
We found your baggage.
It was not in lost baggage.
It was in found baggage.
Compliments of the hotel.
This is so beautiful. Come outside.
Come here and look at this view.
It is so beautiful.
Paris.
You're the only view I want to see.
Oh, Major.
Oh, honey. Come inside.
I want to show you some of the things
I bought today.
Come here.
This is the Sonia Rykiel
I was telling you...
What a beautiful colour.
Yes. I love the colour.
-Material’s beautiful.
-This is beautiful.
It's kind of a Chinese thing
with the little frogs on the side.
-It's a very beautiful thing.
-It's nice and long, too.
-This is the pièce de résistance.
-It's wonderful.
It's an opera coat!
-The colour! Victorian!
-This is beautiful, isn't it?
Elizabethan! It's beautiful. I love it.
-Now this is, of course, the best.
-Stop it.
-It's a Chanel suit!
-Stop it!
Yeah? Yeah? Great.
Hey there, again.
This is Kitty Potter giving you
a glimpse of fashion in the making.
We're behind the scenes at Simone Lo
as she rehearses her show.
And from what we can tell here,
all those models will be wearing
none other than cowboy boots.
Let's look around
to see what else we can find.
Dane, we have to talk.
Did you hear something?
No, maybe just a rat.
-Are there rats here?
-Yeah, but they're harmless, darling.
What would you say
is the difference between
a cross-dresser and a transvestite?
Well, actually, cross-dresser is just
another way of saying transvestite,
which is the same thing
but coming from the Latin root.
How do you choose
what you're going to wear?
-What...
-This is the big problem.
Yeah, because I have too many things,
and it is very difficult to know
what to choose, you know,
from one situation to the other.
And you have to be able to laugh
about yourself, and take it easy.
We are here to have a good time.
It's an old pattern that we started
back in the '30s.
Hi, honey. Here, put these on.
They'll look great with that outfit.
Okay, thanks.
What is she, kidding?
Is she colour-blind?
Those boots don't even match.
-Well, everybody knows that.
-Knows what?
That she's colour-blind.
Well, I didn't.
'Cause I didn't write it on your cards.
Beautiful room. Marvellous.
It's not like the room
we had in Naples.
Let's try the bed.
Remember our room in Naples?
It was tiny, tiny, tiny.
You should've seen the room
I had in Moscow.
Where did you work?
Alone in my room.
I had my workshop
and bed in the same room.
Cut and sew, cut and sew.
Everything on the bed.
Those were terrible times.
Poor thing.
All alone without me.
Did somebody knock?
Relax. Calm down.
I haven't slept much.
I've been looking for you.
Really?
Cigarette?
No, I don't smoke.
Cigarettes calm me down.
These are Russian.
I don't smoke.
"I don't smoke," è inglese?
In Moscow, they say:
"Spasibop nyet papiroski."
It's true. You didn't smoke.
I was a baby. I was only fourteen.
How could I smoke?
-Fourteen.
-Fourteen.
My darling Isabella,
how many years has it been?
No, please. No, Sergio...
-Look at it. It's beautiful.
-May Rose, you are beautiful.
You look beautiful tonight. You do.
That's because
you went shopping for me, darling.
-No one shops like my Louise.
-Yes.
-It's beautiful.
-Very nice.
-Well, what do you think?
-Shall we join someone over there,
-or...
-No, I'd rather sit alone tonight.
You want to be alone? Okay. Fine.
As a woman, you know, I'm just
content. Just here and now.
No, no, Sergio. Please don't.
Get in bed.
Don't you remember?
Have you forgotten?
Go over there, over there...
A little faster.
You know who you look like,
just a little tiny bit?
Barbra Streisand. You do.
In the eyes. You do.
-You really think so?
-Very sweet.
I thought the smile might be
similar to hers.
Hey, you! You with the camera!
I know you! I know who you are!
-Give me that camera!
-Stop!
Stop her! Come back with that camera!
Stop her! She's got my camera!
Stop that girl!
Stop her!
Two husbands, two corpses.
I would like to say
that the shocking circumstances...
of Olivier de la Fontaine's death
are not so shocking.
Mr de la Fontaine has died from
a blockage of the oesophagus...
confirmed to be a morsel
of ham fat.
There it is. Olivier de la Fontaine,
headde la Chambre Syndicale
du Prêt-à-porter et de la Haute Couture
for the past 28 years, has
merely choked on a ham sandwich,
leaving the Paris fashion world
stunned and saddened.
This guy wasn't even murdered.
He choked on a sandwich.
-What a waste of time.
-A complete waste of time.
So what do you think?
I feel like I've grown since I've met you.
So, what would you write about this
charming ensemble
in your column, Anne?
I'd say it's very prêt-à-porter.
-You look great.
-Thank you.
-So?
-So.
I really had a great time.
Me, too.
-If you...
-I think your...
It was very nice to meet you,
Mr Joe Flynn.
It was very nice meeting you, too,
Miss Anne...
Nixon?
Eisenhower.
This has been nice. This is really good.
If he was the only photographer
available, and I suddenly had...
This is Simone Lo.
The collection you are about to see
presents two decades
of an emerging vision.
For me, it's the closing of a circle
and the beginning of something new.
Something new. New. New.
We rolling?
This is Kitty Potter live from Paris
at Simone Lo's défilé.
Well, what can I say?
Simone Lo has shown us everything.
I mean, I don't know how much of this
is going to be on TV or anything but...
It's so new. I mean, it's...
It's so old. I mean, it's...
I mean, she shows it like it really is.
It's so old, it's true.
It's so true, it's new.
It's the oldest new look,
it's the newest old look.
Simone Lo has created
a new, new look
for every man, woman and child.
And they can all afford it.
It's called the bare look.
So, hooray for Simone Lo!
What the hell am I talking about?
I mean, for Christ's sakes,
what is going on here, really?
Can you tell me what's going on
on this planet?
This is fucking fruitcake time.
I mean... Is that fashion?
Is it? I mean, is there a message
out there?
I mean, you got a lot of naked people
wandering around here.
I mean, I've been forever trying to find
out what this bullshit is all about,
and do you know what?
You know what? I have had it.
I have had it. Goodbye. Aurevoir.
Sophie, you got yourself a career.
This is Sophie Choiset for FAD TV.
In May, 1968,
the great couturier Balenciaga
closed his atelier forever because,
he said, "There is no one left to dress."
It appears
Simone Lo believes the same.
She has just shown us a celebration of
fashion in the profoundest sense
of the word.
She has made a statement here today
that will be felt for decades to come.
She's made a choice that will influence
all designers everywhere.
And most of all, she has spoken
to women the world over,
telling them not about what to wear
but how to think about what they want
and need from fashion.
This is Sophie Choiset in Paris
for FAD TV.
Okay, go on, put the diapers
on the kids, will you?
Come on, Winnie!
All right. I guess just about here
is about right. Okay.
Okay.
Hi, sweetie.
In the shadow or in the sun?
Okay, let's go. Got it.
Here, here.
