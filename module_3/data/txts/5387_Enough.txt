So good of you to
come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on
such short notice.
If you can’t trust a Swiss banker,
what’s the world come to?
And now that we’re all comfortable,
why don’t you sit down?
It was not easy, but I
have retrieved the money.
No doubt, Sir Robert will
be pleased to see it again.
At the current rate of
exchange, minus the fees
and certain unforeseeable expenses.
This is the receipt.
Would you like to check my figures?
Oh, I’m sure they’re perfectly rounded.
It’s all there.
I didn’t come for the money.
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an MI6 agent who was killed for it.
I want to know
who killed him.
Terrible tragedy.
I just want a name.
I am merely the middleman.
I’m just trying to do the honorable thing,
returning the money
to its rightful owner.
And we know how difficult that
can be for a Swiss banker.
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.
And I’m giving you the opportunity to
walk out with your life.
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,
I would have to say that the numbers
are not on your side.
Perhaps you failed to take
into account my hidden assets.
You seem to have had a small
reversal of fortune.
Give me the name.
I can’t tell you.
Let’s count to three.
You can do that, can’t you?
One, two...
All right. All right.
But you’ll have to protect me.
James. Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?
Chocolates? An engagement ring?
I thought you’d enjoy one of these.
How romantic.
I know exactly where to put that.
Oh, Moneypenny,
the story of our relationship.
Close, but no cigar.
I hate to tear you away
from affairs of state, 007.
Would you mind coming in?
Right away, M.
Sir Robert King,
James Bond.
The man who
retrieved my money.
I can’t thank you enough.
Excellent work.
Be careful, M. I might
try to steal him from you.
Construction’s not exactly my specialty.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
Best to the family.
Old friend?
We read law at Oxford together.
I always knew he’d conquer the world.
Care for a drink?
Yes, thank you.
He’s a man of great integrity.
Who buys stolen reports
for three million pounds.
Thank you.
Any leads on the sniper?
Not one.
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.
Is this the stolen report?
Yes. Classified.
From the Russian Atomic Energy Department.
What would King want this for?
He was led to believe the document
was a secret report
identifying the terrorists
who’d attacked a new oil pipeline
he’s building in the region.
Interesting.
But it doesn’t exactly explain
why someone would want me
out of their office alive.
King! The money.
Moneypenny, stop King.
Move! Move, move!
Get out of the way!
Stop!
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move!
Stop, stop! It isn’t finished!
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!
What was that?
Let’s go!
What the hell do you think you’re...
Let go!
Listen to me!
You can’t get away.
We can make a deal.
Just tell me who’s behind this.
Who are you working for?
Don’t do it!
Don’t blow us up!
I can protect you.
Do you understand?
I can protect you.
Not from him!
I know how to hurt
I know how to heal
I know what to show
And what to conceal
I know when to talk
And I know when to touch
No one ever died
from wanting too much
The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place
to start, my love
And if you’re strong enough
Together we can take
the world apart, my love
We know when to kiss
And we know when to kill
If we can’t have it all
Then nobody will
The world is not enough
But it is such a perfect place
to start, my love
And if you’re strong enough
Together we can take
the world apart, my love
I feel sick
I feel scared
I feel ready
And yet unprepared
The world is not enough
No, nowhere near enough
The world is not enough
Hello, my dear.
Who is that young woman?
King’s daughter.
Elektra.
Thank you.
The money was
dipped in urea.
In effect, a highly
compacted fertilizer bomb.
Having handled the money,
the water on 007’s hands
when he touched the ice
started a chemical reaction.
In one of the notes, the metal
anti-counterfeiting strip
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.
And King’s lapel pin
was switched for a copy
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.
In other words, he set off
the bomb that killed him.
We know it was someone
close to King,
and our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.
But given the size of King’s organization,
it could be anyone, anywhere.
M.
This will not stand.
We will not be terrorized by cowards
who’d murder an innocent man
and use us as the tool.
We’ll find the people
who committed this atrocity.
We’ll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth, if needs be.
And we will
bring them to justice.
Tanner!
Sorry, James. M says you’re off
the active-duty list
until you’re cleared by medical.
Dislocated collarbone.
If any more tendons snap,
I’m afraid you’re going to be
out of action for weeks.
Molly, I need
a clean bill of health.
You have to clear me for duty.
James, that wouldn’t really be...
Ethical?
Practical, smart.
Well, let’s just skirt the issue,
shall we?
You’d have to promise
to call me this time.
Whatever the doctor orders.
Then I suppose, if you stayed in
constant contact...
Of course.
If you showed sufficient stamina.
Cut out all kinds of...
Strenuous activity?
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?
Oh, pipe down, 007.
Was it something I said?
No. Something you destroyed.
My fishing boat for my
retirement away from you.
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow
I’m grooming to follow me.
Helps if you open the door.
And you might be?
This is 007!
If you’re Q, does that make him R?
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.
Or at least half of it.
Now, I dare say, 007, that you’ve
met your match with this machine.
Yeah? New model? Improved specs?
I thought you were
on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?
Yes, well, we’ll see about that. So?
As I was saying, the very
latest in interception countermeasures.
Titanium armor, a multitasking
heads-up display
and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.
« Fully loaded, » I think is the term.
I think...
You’re not here to think.
You’re here to do what I tell you.
Now, go put on the coat
and demonstrate it for 007.
But of course.
Now, watch closely, please, 007.
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus.
And the left arm in
the left sleeve, thus.
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.
Take the lower part of the zipper
and insert it into the...
Pull the tag.
You said...
He seems well-suited for the job.
You’re not retiring
anytime soon, are you?
Now, pay attention, 007.
I’ve always tried to
teach you two things.
First, never let them see you bleed.
And the second?
Always have an escape plan.
Good evening. The Elektra King
kidnap ordeal is over.
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped
after shooting dead two of her captors
and is...
He shouted.
Shouted all the time.
Level one,
clearance required.
Level one,
clearance required.
Yes, 007?
Tell me about the kidnapping
of Elektra King.
I wasn’t aware you had an assignment
on this case.
I brought the money in that killed King.
Don’t make this personal.
I’m not. Are you?
You’re the only one
who could seal her file.
Will you excuse us?
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.
What happened?
After Elektra King was kidnapped,
her father tried to deal
with it on his own, with no success.
So he came to me.
As you are aware, we do
not negotiate with terrorists.
And against every instinct in my heart,
every emotion as a mother,
I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.
You used the girl as bait.
Yes.
The money in King’s briefcase
was precisely the same amount
as the ransom
demand for his daughter.
It’s a message.
Your terrorist is back.
Victor Zokas,
a. k. a...
Renard, the anarchist.
He was operating
in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.
And he’s been spotted in
Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran,
Beirut and Cambodia.
All the romantic vacation spots.
His only goal is chaos.
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.
Before he completed the
mission, Elektra escaped.
A week later, our man
caught up with the target.
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet’s still there.
How did he survive?
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn’t get the bullet out,
so Renard killed him.
It’s moving through
the medulla oblongata,
killing off his senses, touch, smell.
He feels no pain.
He can push himself harder,
longer than any normal man.
The bullet will kill him,
but he’ll grow stronger every day,
until the day he dies.
Robert is dead. MI6 is humiliated.
He’s had his revenge.
Not quite.
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping,
and there’s still one he hasn’t touched.
Elektra.
M.
I see the good
doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have
exceptional stamina.
I’m sure she was touched
by his dedication
to the job in hand.
007, I want you to go to Elektra.
She’s taken over the construction
of her father’s
oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.
Find who switched that pin.
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back,
and Elektra will be the next target.
The worm on the hook again.
She doesn’t need to know it’s the same
man that may be after her.
Don’t frighten her.
A shadow operation?
Remember, shadows stay in
front or behind,
never on top.
You, go back. Leave.
This area is closed.
I’m here to see Elektra King.
James Bond, Universal Exports.
And I’m Davidov, chief of security.
As you can see, we’re having some
problems with the villagers.
I told Miss King to stay
at the office in Baku.
Oh, hell.
Miss King, I told you to stay...
I know what you told me.
Send the pipe around.
It’s going to take
weeks and cost millions.
Your father approved this route.
Then my father was wrong.
Do it.
Davidov. I’ll talk to her.
I saw you at my father’s funeral.
Yes. I’m sorry.
M told me she was
sending someone. Mr...
Bond. James Bond.
Did you know my father?
I met him once, briefly.
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.
Saving the church?
And avoiding the bloodshed.
A hundred years ago,
my mother’s family discovered
the oil here.
When the Soviet Union
was formed,
the Communists spent the next
70 years
plundering our countryside for it.
I saw the mess they
left on the drive in.
The new pipeline will
guarantee our future.
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.
But you didn’t come here
to talk about oil, did you?
No.
Tell me,
have you ever lost
a loved one, Mr. Bond?
M sent me because we’re afraid
your life might be in danger.
Please, I want to
show you something.
I’m trying to build an 800-mile
pipeline through Turkey,
past the terrorists in Iraq,
Iran and Syria.
Up here, the Russians have
three competing pipelines.
And they’ll do anything to stop me.
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,
and you, Mr. Bond,
have come all this way
to tell me that I
« might » be in danger?
We suspect there
might be an insider.
My father’s pin.
No, a duplicate
with a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.
My family has relied
on MI6 twice, Mr. Bond.
I won’t make that
mistake a third time.
I’m going to finish building this
pipeline, and I don’t need your help.
Now, if you’ll excuse me,
I have to check
the survey lines.
I’ve always wanted to
check the survey lines.
You don’t take no
for an answer, do you?
No.
I hope you know
how to ski, then.
I came prepared
for a cold reception.
Can’t land.
Wind’s too strong.
Hold her steady.
You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
Seems you enjoy being chased.
It probably happens all the time.
Less often than you might think.
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline.
Your father’s legacy.
My family’s legacy to the world.
Expecting visitors?
No.
This isn’t a social call.
Head for the gully.
I’ll lead them into the trees.
Go, go!
See you back at the lodge.
Oh, my God!
It’s all right.
We’re buried alive!
It’s all right!
I can’t stay here!
You’re not going to.
You’re not going to.
Elektra. I can’t breathe.
Elektra, Elektra, Elektra!
I can’t breathe!
I can’t breathe!
Look at me.
Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes!
You’re all right.
Everything’s all right.
Trust me. Okay?
She’s fine.
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov, him.
Are you all right?
I need to ask you something.
And I want you to
tell me the truth.
Who is it?
Who’s trying to kill me?
I told you
I don’t know.
But I’m gonna find him.
Not good enough.
After the kidnapping,
I was afraid.
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.
I was afraid to be in a crowd.
I was afraid to
do anything at all.
Until I realized
I can’t hide in the shadows.
I can’t let fear run my life.
I won’t.
After I find him, you won’t have to.
Don’t go.
Stay with me.
Please?
I can’t do that.
I thought it was
your job to protect me.
You’ll be safe here.
I don’t want to be safe.
I’ll be back soon.
And who’s afraid now,
Mr. Bond?
I want to see
Valentin Zukovsky.
Impossible.
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.
Tell him James Bond is here.
Now.
I don’t think you heard me.
Mr. Zukovsky would be
delighted to see you.
After you.
No. After you.
I insist.
And a little for you.
Bond! James Bond!
Meet Niña and Verushka.
Lose the girls, Valentin.
We need to talk.
Why am I suddenly worried that I’m not
carrying enough insurance?
Chill out, James.
Fine, ladies. Go on. Beat it. Scram.
Bull, give them an inch.
And make sure they
lose it in this casino.
I’ll see you later, Mr. Bond.
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.
Mr. Bullion
does not trust banks.
So, what would you
like to talk about?
I’m not sure I
can really help you.
I’m a legitimate
businessman now.
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky’s Finest.
Take a look at this.
Russian Special Services.
Atomic Energy Anti-terrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?
I took it off a parahawk which
tried to kill Elektra King this morning.
Renard is behind this.
I think you and I had
better have a drink.
And then after Afghanistan,
the KGB decided Renard was
a liability and just cut him loose.
Now he works freelance.
But for whom?
There are four competing pipelines.
I’m willing to bet
half the customers
in this casino would be very happy
to see the King pipeline disappear.
What’s funny?
Nothing.
It just appears Miss King does not
share your concern.
What are you doing here?
The same thing you are.
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.
Let me take you home.
Now.
No. I want them to
see I’m not frightened.
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We’ve kept your father’s chair free.
Free? Nothing comes free
from you, Zukovsky.
Your father had a credit
line with us, $1 million U.S.
I’d be happy to extend you that
courtesy.
So what’s it to be?
Blackjack, your father’s favorite?
Let’s keep it simple.
One card. High draw.
A million dollars.
Wait. Bury the top three cards.
You’re determined to
protect me, aren’t you?
Perhaps from yourself.
You don’t have to do this.
There’s no point in living
if you can’t feel alive.
Queen of hearts.
It appears that you have been
beaten by the ace of clubs.
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.
Shall we?
Elektra, this is a game
I can’t afford to play.
I know.
What happened to Davidov?
I gave him the night off.
Welcome to
the Devil’s Breath.
For thousands of years,
Hindu pilgrims have journeyed to this
holy place
to witness the wonder of the miracle of the
natural flames that never die
and to test their devotion to God
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands
as they said their daily prayers.
Tell me, Davidov, what
happened this afternoon?
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.
Yes, but Bond...
Bond was unarmed.
And you, Arkov?
Is everything
ready for tomorrow?
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car,
and I have arranged
for a plane tonight, but...
But what?
We should scrub
the rest of the mission.
The parahawks were
meant to be returned.
People will start
asking questions, even of me,
all because of his incompetence.
I see.
I see you’re right.
You’re right, he should be punished.
Davidov, hold this for me.
It was wrong of me to
expect so much of you.
Kill him.
He failed his test of devotion.
You can take his place.
Take his ID.
And do be on time.
Poor shoulder.
It looks painful.
Needs constant attention.
I knew.
I knew when I first saw you.
I knew it would be like this.
Enough ice for one day.
How did you survive?
I seduced the guards,
used my body.
It gave me control.
And the rest, I got a gun and
started shooting.
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?
I take pleasure
in great beauty.
Let’s go.
It’s getting late.
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.
He was buried with work.
Let’s go. Get your stuff.
Okay, come on.
Let’s get out of here.
You’re late.
Did you bring it? The grease.
Of course.
Excellent.
Get ready.
We’re 10 minutes out.
But make sure you wear the ID.
I’m gonna go get some air.
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I’m a great admirer
of your research.
Not often we see someone
of your stature here.
I go where the work takes me.
By the way, you have
the transport documents?
I pulled the plutonium out
of the one inside.
You can detonate the triggers now.
Okay.
Look. Our IDA physicist.
Don’t bother. Not interested in men.
Take my word for it.
Last year, we decommissioned
four test sites.
Not even a glimmer.
Are you here for a reason or are you
just hoping for a glimmer?
And you are?
Mikhail Arkov, Russian Atomic
Energy Department.
Miss...
Dr. Jones.
Christmas Jones.
And don’t make any jokes.
I’ve heard them all.
I don’t know
any doctor jokes.
This is okay.
Take the elevator
down the hall.
Your friends are
already down there.
Don’t I get some
type of protection?
No, Dr. Arkov.
Down there it’s all
weapons-grade plutonium.
Reasonably safe.
Up here we’ve got hydrogen bombs
that your lab built
leaking tritium,
which I’ve spent the last six months
trying to clean up.
So if you need any
protection at all, it’s from me.
Your friends are waiting for you.
Doctor?
Aren’t you forgetting?
Yes, of course. Thank you.
By the way...
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet
instead of the plane.
Get off. Keep your mouth shut.
You can’t kill me,
I’m already dead.
Yeah, not dead enough for me.
You could show a little gratitude,
I did spare your life
at the banker’s office.
That’s right.
I couldn’t kill you.
You were working for me.
You delivered the money, killed King,
and now you
brought me the plane.
What’s your plan for the bomb?
You first.
Or could it be you don’t have a plan?
That bomb will never leave this room.
Neither will you.
How sad to be threatened by a man
who can’t grasp what he’s involved in.
Revenge is not hard to fathom for a man
who believes in nothing.
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?
Go ahead, shoot me.
I’ll welcome it.
My men will hear the shot and kill you.
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.
But when a certain phone call
isn’t made in 20 minutes,
Elektra dies.
You’re bluffing.
She’s beautiful, isn’t she?
You should have had her before,
when she was innocent.
How does it feel to know
I broke her in for you?
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.
Cold-blooded murder
is a filthy business.
A man tires of being executed.
But in your case,
I feel nothing, just like you.
But then again, there’s no point living
if you can’t feel alive.
Huh?
Hey!
Drop the gun!
Keep away, Colonel.
He’s an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.
This is your impostor,
along with the men
outside on the plane.
They’re stealing the bomb.
I said drop it!
On your knees!
Well done.
He would’ve killed us all.
Did you speak to him?
Yeah, but he’s no
atomic scientist.
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.
You had me,
but I knew you couldn’t
shoulder the responsibility.
Now, without any further
interruptions, let’s proceed.
There are too many
new faces around here,
including yours.
The bomb doesn’t move
until I am satisfied.
Hey, all of you,
to the surface, now.
Come on! Go!
Move!
They’re sealing us in.
Who are you?
I work for
the British government.
Stay calm.
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond,
but we’re even.
Soon, you’ll feel
nothing at all.
Seal the door! Close it!
Come on!
Keep going!
Move! Hang on!
So, you’re a British spy.
Do you have a name?
The name’s Bond.
James Bond.
Don’t stop!
Go, go! Jump!
They won’t get very far.
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.
You mean one of these?
Do we have the range
of Renard’s plane?
Anywhere in this circle.
Russia, Armenia, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan...
I’m sorry to interrupt. Elektra King is
calling from Baku.
It’s on the video line.
Put her on the wall screen.
I’m sorry. I would never call you,
except James has disappeared.
He left my villa in
the middle of the night,
and my head of
security has been found
near your local airstrip,
murdered.
I’ll send someone out.
M, could you come?
I can’t help thinking I’m next.
Get me out there.
No, listen...
Just get me out there.
Gabor?
James?
Surprised?
What are you doing?
What’s wrong with you?
Are you crazy?
Maybe.
Maybe I should ask you.
After all, « there’s no point
in living if you can’t feel alive. »
Isn’t that right, Elektra?
Isn’t that your motto?
What are you talking about?
Or did you steal it from
your old friend Renard?
What?
He and I had a chat this
morning. Knew all about us.
Knew about my shoulder.
Knew exactly where to hurt me.
Are you saying Renard is the man
who’s trying to kill me?
Drop the act.
It’s over.
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.
I think you do.
It’s called Stockholm syndrome,
common in kidnappings.
Young, impressionable victim.
Sheltered.
Sexually inexperienced.
A powerful kidnapper
skilled in torture, manipulation.
Something snaps in the victim’s mind.
The captive falls in
love with her captor.
How dare you?
How dare you?
That animal? That monster?
He disgusts me.
You disgust me.
So he knew where to
hurt you, is that it?
You had a sling on your arm
at the funeral.
And I didn’t have to sleep with you
to find that out.
He used your exact words.
So you knew.
You knew all the time
that he was out there,
that he was coming for me,
and you lied.
You used me.
You used me as bait.
And you made love to me.
What?
To pass the time as you
waited for him to strike?
Hello?
He’s struck again.
Ten men are dead
at the pipeline.
I’m coming with you.
You do what you want to do,
but I’ve called M.
She’s coming to take charge.
Oh, no.
I want an update.
Where do we stand?
One of Renard’s men removed the
locator card from the bomb
so we can’t track it.
But...
But what?
With all due respect,
I don’t think
you should be here.
May I remind you that
you’re the reason I’m here, 007.
You disobeyed a direct order and
left that girl alone.
Perhaps that girl isn’t as
innocent as you think.
What are you saying?
Suppose the inside man,
the one who switched
King’s lapel pin,
turned out to be an inside woman?
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?
Why? To what end?
I don’t know, yet.
Look at that.
That’s not right.
What is it?
An observation rig.
Travels inside the pipe
looking for cracks.
Shut it down.
I don’t understand.
It won’t respond.
The place is clean.
No sign of the bomb.
The bomb is in the pipeline.
Oh, my God!
They must have
brought it through here.
That would explain the attack.
Heading for the oil terminal.
Where it would do the most damage.
Have your men evacuate that terminal.
So now do you believe me?
This is
an emergency situation.
So, please, clear the room. Do it.
He’s going for the oil.
Of course.
The one pipeline the West is counting on
to supply our reserves for the next century.
Do you have an idea?
Maybe.
How far is that rig
from the terminal?
And how fast is it traveling?
It’s 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.
We’ve got 78 minutes.
Do you have another rig?
There’s one parked
in the passageway ahead of it.
Charles, can you get
me out there?
Of course.
Wait a minute.
Are you gonna do what
I think you’re gonna do?
What do I need to
defuse a nuclear bomb?
Me.
There it is.
Hatch to the passageway.
Take the controls.
You keep the speed up so
the other rig catches up with us.
I’ll be waiting
to hear from you.
Gotcha.
You know how to drive
one of these things?
Doesn’t exactly take a degree in
nuclear physics.
They’re in the pipeline.
They’re on the move.
Faster!
If there’s even
the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.
He’s the best we have,
though I’d never tell him.
I hope you’re right.
Here it comes!
It’s closing up. Faster!
Sit tight.
No brakes!
The controls are jammed!
It’s a tactical
fission device, low yield.
Hold me steady.
You’ve defused
hundreds of these, right?
Yeah, but they’re
usually standing still.
Yeah, well, life’s
full of small challenges.
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.
Someone’s tampered with the bomb.
Look, half the plutonium’s missing.
So what are you saying?
It couldn’t go nuclear?
There’s still enough explosive in
there to kill both of us
if the trigger charge goes off.
Let it blow.
But I can stop it.
Let it blow!
Trust me! Leave it!
Move down. Move down!
Jump! Go on, jump!
Jump!
Robinson’s reporting.
The bomb was a dud.
But the triggering charge blew
out a 50-yard section of the pipe.
And Bond?
Nothing.
I’m so sorry.
But I have a gift for you.
Something that belonged to my father.
He would’ve wanted you to have it.
Perhaps this isn’t the time.
Please.
He often spoke of how
compassionately you advised him
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.
It’s very valuable, you know.
I just couldn’t let it
explode with the rest of him.
I was very upset when the money
didn’t kill both of you.
I didn’t think I’d
get another chance.
Then you dropped the answer
right in my lap.
Bond. And as you say,
he’s the best you have.
Or should I say, « had »?
Take her to the helicopter.
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump, jump!
Do you wanna explain
why you did that?
I could’ve stopped that bomb.
You almost killed us.
I did kill us.
She thinks we’re dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.
Do you wanna put that in English for
those of us who don’t speak « spy »?
Who’s « she »?
Elektra King.
Well, why would she blow up
her own pipeline?
It makes her look innocent.
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.
And they make it look
like a terrorist attack.
But why leave this half?
So there’s enough to spread around to
cover up for the part that they did take.
But what are they gonna do
with the other half?
It’s not enough to make a nuclear bomb.
You’re the scientist, you tell me.
I don’t know.
But the world’s greatest terrorist
running around with six kilos
of weapons-grade plutonium
can’t be good.
I have to get it back, or
somebody’s gonna have my ass.
First things first.
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?
By the way,
before we go any further,
I just wanna know,
what’s the story
with you and Elektra?
We’re strictly platonic. Now.
Bond to Robinson. Copy?
What’s your story?
What are you doing
here in Kazakhstan?
Avoiding those kind of
questions, just like you.
I read you, 007.
Red alert.
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.
Await instructions. Out.
What do we do now?
There’s one critical element here
I may have overlooked.
What? More plutonium?
No.
Beluga.
Caviar.
Brought me something?
The power to reshape the world.
Go on. It’s safe.
Touch your destiny.
I have brought something
for you, as well.
Your present, courtesy
of the late Mr. Bond.
My executioner.
Overpraise, I’m afraid.
But my people will finish the job.
Your people?
Your people will leave you here to rot
just like you left me.
You and my father.
Your father wasn’t...
My father was nothing.
His kingdom, he stole from my mother.
The kingdom I will
rightly take back.
I hope you’re proud
of what you did to her.
I’m afraid it is
you who deserve credit.
When I took her,
she was promise itself,
and you left her at the mercy of
a man like me.
You ruined her.
For what? To get to me?
She’s worth 50 of me.
For once, I agree with you.
Yes.
And now we also share a common fate.
You will die,
along with everyone in this city
and the bright, starry, oil-driven
future of the West.
Since you sent your man to kill me,
I’ve been watching
time tick slowly away,
marching toward my own death.
Now you can have the same pleasure.
Watch these hands, M.
By noon tomorrow, your time is up.
And I guarantee you, I will not miss.
So beautiful.
So smooth.
So warm.
How would you know?
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?
It’s what you wanted.
Of course it’s what I wanted.
He was...
He was a good lover?
What do you think?
I wouldn’t feel anything?
I feel nothing.
What about this?
But surely, you can feel this?
Remember pleasure?
Wait here.
Always something.
First the casino,
now the caviar factory.
I am a slave to
the free-market economy.
Hello?
Bond is alive.
Is nothing
in this place straight?
Who are you?
And how did you get in?
I’ll call security
and congratulate them.
Drink?
Can’t you just say hello
like a normal person?
Get lost.
No, no, no.
Down the back.
What’s your business
with Elektra King?
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don’t even blink an eye.
What’s she paying you off for?
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that,
I wouldn’t bet on it.
$5000 of beluga ruined.
That’s nothing compared to what a
20-megaton nuclear bomb can do.
What are you talking about?
We had a nuclear bomb
stolen this morning.
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.
I didn’t know.
Well, what do you know?
Q’s not gonna like this.
Hide!
Get out!
Help!
Now, where were we?
A rope, please!
No. The truth.
She has M.
I know nothing about that.
Those blades were meant for you.
What does Elektra King
want you dead for?
It was you who
destroyed my factory,
then you drown my Rolls-Royce,
and now you’re trying to
drown me in my own caviar!
Let me out!
Too bad we don’t
have any champagne.
Or sour cream.
Okay, okay.
Occasionally, I get equipment for her.
Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.
And the payoff in the casino?
It was a special job.
My nephew is in the navy.
He’s smuggling some machinery for her.
Where?
Absolutely not!
Where?
Where?
Istanbul!
You! Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?
Sorry, boss.
I must have bumped my head.
Oh, really?
Get me out of here,
I’ll show you what
a bumped head feels like.
Look. We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.
This used to be the
KGB’s Istanbul safe house.
Now it’s FSB. Federal Security Bureau.
Same old friendly service
with a new name.
Did you raise Nikoli?
Nothing.
Try scanning
the emergency frequencies.
Tragedy.
In the old days, there were at least
a hundred places where
a submarine could surface undetected.
Submarine?
What class is your nephew running?
Victor Ill, you call it.
Nuclear. He’s not loading cargo.
They want the sub.
They want to use the reactor.
That’s it.
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub’s reactor,
instant catastrophic meltdown.
Making it all look
just like an accident.
But why?
Because the existing pipelines
from the Caspian Sea go to the north. Here.
The oil is put on-board the tankers,
shipped across the Black Sea,
down to Istanbul.
The explosion would destroy Istanbul,
contaminating the Bosporus for decades.
And there’d be only
one way to get the oil out.
Yeah, down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.
Elektra’s pipeline.
We must find Nikoli.
Captain Nikoli?
Sir.
Ready to load your cargo.
We have only a few hours
before we’ll be missed.
You came with a skeleton crew?
Yeah, that’s all we
can afford these days.
Of course.
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.
Thank you.
Good morning.
What’s the time?
It’s time for you to die.
I’ve got something
on the emergency frequency.
Two six-digit numbers
cycled every 15 seconds.
A GPS signal.
Position coordinates.
Locator card. M.
Here.
Yeah. Maiden’s Tower.
Have you been there?
No. No. Mr. Bullion.
Bomb!
Come on, come on, come on.
After you. I insist.
Enjoyed your meal, boys?
Take them up and throw them in the sea.
The extruder is in here.
It will take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.
Put them in here.
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.
Is your helicopter ready?
It’s going to pick
me up in half an hour.
Then this is the end.
No. This is the beginning.
The world will never be the same.
The future is yours.
Have fun with it.
James Bond.
If only you’d kept away,
we might have met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.
Take her to Renard.
Pretty thing.
You had her, too?
I could’ve given you the world.
The world is not enough.
Foolish sentiment.
Family motto.
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.
They also found this chair.
I think we ignore the old ways
at our peril, don’t you?
Where’s M?
Soon, she’ll be everywhere.
All this because you fell for Renard?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
I’ve always had
a power over men.
When I realized
my father wouldn’t
rescue me from the kidnappers,
I knew I had to
form another alliance.
You turned Renard.
Just like you, only you were even easier.
I told him
he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.
When he refused, l told
him I would do it myself.
So you killed your father.
He killed me.
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.
Was this all about the oil?
It is my oil.
Mine and my family’s.
It runs in my veins,
thicker than blood.
I’m going to
redraw the map.
And when I’m through,
the whole world will know my name,
my grandfather’s name,
the glory of my people!
No one will believe this
meltdown was an accident.
Ha! They will believe.
They will all believe.
You understand?
Nobody can resist me.
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?
Elektra, it’s not too late.
Eight million people need not die.
You should’ve killed me
when you had the chance.
But you couldn’t. Not me.
Not a woman you’ve loved.
You meant nothing to me.
One last screw.
Oh, James.
Boss, you’re alive.
So glad to see you.
Me too.
I’m looking for a submarine.
It’s big and black, and the driver is a very
good friend of mine.
Bring it to me.
What a shame.
He’s just gone.
Zukovsky really hated you.
Everything’s
under control up here.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Time to say good night.
James, you can’t kill me,
not in cold blood.
Bond!
Call him off.
I won’t ask again.
Call him off. Call him off!
Renard.
You wouldn’t kill me.
You’d miss me.
Yes.
Dive! Bond...
I never miss.
Where is she?
James!
Thought I’d forgotten you, eh?
Level at 100 feet.
Hold her steady.
Level at 100 feet.
If we can force them
up to the surface,
they’ll show up on the spy satellite,
bring out the navy.
Come on. Get up!
Over there. Go! Move!
Move! Go, go, go!
Get over there! Stay! Up!
Get us level! Level!
It’s all smashed!
Christmas?
So we’re going up, then?
Slight miscalculation.
Hold on!
Hold on, hold on.
Brace yourself.
It’s flooding!
Get up to the hatch.
Damn! Come on! Go, go!
Move! Go on! Get out, now!
He’s opened up the reactor!
And locked himself in!
I have to get up there to him.
We’ve got one chance.
I’ll get out of
the submarine and back in
through the reactor
room escape hatch.
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.
James, it’s too risky.
If I don’t make it,
use this chamber to get out.
Close the hatch.
Be sure to exhale all
the way up. Close it.
James!
Help!
Come on, come on!
We’re safe from the radiation
as long as the reactor
coolant doesn’t burst.
If he had gotten
the plutonium rod in the reactor,
we could’ve written
off the whole city.
James!
Welcome to my nuclear family.
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?
You forget, I’m already dead.
Haven’t you heard?
So is she.
You’re lying.
Liar!
She’s waiting for you.
The hydrogen gas
level’s too high.
One spark and the reactor will blow.
I have to stop it.
Go to the top of the submarine.
I’ll meet you in
the torpedo bay. Go!
The reactor is flooded.
So it’s safe even
if this place blows.
Hey!
Hi!
Hello!
No, it’s simply not the case.
No. Before that.
Any word?
No. Still no contact.
Always wanted to have
Christmas in Turkey.
Was that a Christmas joke?
From me? No. Never.
So isn’t it time you
unwrapped your present?
Oh, I think so.
Look. What’s that?
The card.
So he must be nearby.
Where?
Where?
It picks up body heat,
so humans come out orange.
There.
I thought you said
he was with Dr. Jones?
It’s getting redder.
007!
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.
I was wrong about you.
Yeah? How so?
I thought Christmas
only comes once a year.
