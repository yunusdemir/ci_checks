Hey, Riley, we're all plugged
in and tuned up. We close?
Yeah, we're ready.
Hey, Ray Bob, Riley wants
to hear your mike.
Right here. Say something into that mike.
Let him hear that.
One, two-One, two,
three, testing. One-.
How's that sound?
That's a good level, Buddy.
Hold it right there.
Yeah, you better get ready.
It's about 30 seconds till 8:00.
We're ready.
Hey, Doug, you'll have to quit now.
We're going on the air.
Okay.
Yes, ma'am. You're in tune with radio
station KDAV. In Lubbock, Texas,
1310 on your dial,
where it's just about 8:00.
Time for the Holly Hayride brought
to you this week by Verti-Gro.
Now through the remote facilities
of KDAV, we take you...
live and direct
to Parker's Roller Rink...
for this weekend's
Holly Hayride Show!
I'd like to welcome you all to
the Buddy Holly Hayride tonight.
We'd like to kick things off with a
little tune by Les Paul and Mary Ford.

No, I don't know what it is. You'd

I am not buying bebop.
Well, I did tell him
no more bebop music.
Go on out there. Cut him off the air.
Do something.
Well, no, sir,
I can't cut him off,
but I'm going to call out there and tell
Parker to tell him to quit that stuff.

Thank you, Brother Smith,
for that beautiful music.
Beautiful music.
And on the subject of music,
I have a few words that I'd like
to share with all of you...
before we start the service.
Now, those of you who have already
seen this morning's paper...
might suspect that I am
prompted to these comments...
by what took place
in our town last night...
at the roller rink.
Friends, there is
a new form of music-
if you can call it music-
that is as un-Christian...
and un-American as anything we have
had to face in the past 50 years!
Now, this music,
this jungle rhythm,
this abandonment...
that seems so popular
with some of our children...
is a threat to our morals.
Yea, I say that it is in fact...
a threat to our very society!
And I urge all you parents...
to do anything possible to
keep your children far away...
from the disgraceful kinds
of goings-on...
which apparently follow on the heels
of this new music...
and of those who perform it!
For what we are about to receive, O
Lord, help us be truly thankful. Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Thank you.
I'll have a drumstick...
and another drumstick.
You've got to admit, Buddy,
we've been mighty patient.
We never said a word when you decided
not to go on to the seminary.
And we let you sow your wild
oats playin' your music.
I think it's time you told
your father and me...
just what your plans
for the future are.
I haven't even thought about it.
I don't know.
You put off college
for over a year.
What for?
To play this jungle music?
How could it be jungle music
if I wrote it?
Well, you got the whole town
down around our ears.
It seems like everybody
hates the stuff.
What about those people
that were there last night?
Just a bunch of kids.
They won't always be kids.
We just want you to have
somethin' to fall back on...
in case things
don't work out for you.
Well, Mom,
I'm not gonna fall back.
You had best give your future...
some serious thought right now.
You think there'd be
somethin' good on this somewhere.
Maybe Shreveport.
♪♪ KWKH, rhythm and blues.
♪♪ What are you doin'?
You know, Buddy, it's been more
than a year since we graduated.
I know.
I mean, I keep wakin' up
on campus every mornin'...
just hopin' I'll see you with me.
Well, maybe you will.
I'd like to be sure everything's
the same between us, you know?
What are you doing?
Charles Hardin Holly,
what am I going to do with you?
I guess nothin'!

- I don't know.
What are you guys doin'?
Well, I'll show ya.
My gosh!
Hey, there he is!
The man that's bringin' rock and roll to the
great state of Texas and my radio station.
How ya doin'? Hey, I
got something for you.
Lookee here.
It's about time.
Little Richard, Fats Domino,
Big Joe Turner.
Take 'em home with ya. I can't play 'em.
Thank you. Thank you.
What'd you call this, rock or roll?
Rock and roll.
Disc jockey up in Cleveland made that one
up, and he's doin' real fine with it too.
In Cleveland.
Got to get a maid here.
I'm sorry about that stuff
at the roller rink,
but I can't play those regular radio songs
when you put those kids in front of me.
I got to play my own stuff. Well, I've
only heard from one sponsor so far.
What'd he say?
He wasn't too keen on it.
But I'm not going
to worry about it,
'cause I did hear from another
guy, a guy named Wilson.
He was in town, and he
heard your show. Yeah?
And he wants to see the band
next Thursday...
in Nashville.
In Nashville?
Nashville.

be vice president of World Records.

Shoot, shit!
I hear you been getting nowhere, Buddy.
What's the problem?
The problem is they want to make us play
hillbilly, but we don't play hillbilly.
We thought you wanted to do
what we did at the roller rink.
Look, sonny, I told you.
We don't make Negro records here.
Buddy, I truly appreciated what
you did at the roller rink,
but T.J. here
is our top producer,
and he's in charge of the music
when we come into the studio.
Okay?
Well...
I have a sound in my head, and so far
it's not like anything we've done here.
Wilson, the kid don't like
Elvis Presley.
I like Elvis fine, but I'm Buddy Holly.
Just a minute.
Yeah, Buddy.
You said we were going to do our music our
way. You're not even usin' our drums.
Drums is for parades, boy.
Well, someone screwed up the music.
It sounds like S-H-I-T, pal.
Right. Hell, they don't even allow
drums at the Grand Ole Opry.
We're not country players. Why do you
have a country band playin' behind us?
'Cause there ain't no such
thing as a hit record...
with just three guys playin'
in any kind of music.
That's just it. We've arranged it so a small
group will sound as good as a big one.
You called me Monday and said,
"Let's make some records fast."
I'm here. This is what we've done.
What do you call it?
Probably a mistake, Buddy.
Excuse me.
Well,
I guess that tears it, hotshot.
Now, why don't you get your nigger-lovin'
ass right back out there where you belong?
Come on, baby.
Come on!
Let's get the hell
back to Lubbock, boys.
Hey, Riley. How
you doin', Buddy?
Aw, gettin' out of
show business.
That's bullshit. They're not the
only record company in the world.
What are you doin', anyway?
I just signed off at the station.
I want to talk to you.
I'm really catching hell from some of
the sponsors about your radio show.
You know that. Yeah, I heard.
Sorry.
Buddy, I'm not makin' diddly
on the station as it is,
or else I'd tell every single
one of 'em to jump up my ass.
But if I lose one more sponsor,
I'm going to lose the station.
That's all there is to it. So,
from now on I want you...
to just play strictly country music
on your show, just like you used to.
No. Come on, Riley. I got to
play in front of the people.
If I'm not moved, how are they going to be moved?
I can't be moved by playing country music.
That's the way it has to be, or else
I'm going to have to fire your ass.
I'll have to get you off the air.
Well, then pull me off the air.
God. I'm sorry, Buddy.
That's okay. That's okay, Riley.
I'm sorry.
It's business, Buddy.
Yeah, I know.
Show business.
I don't know whether it's going
to cheer you up or not,
but I did send your tape to a guy I know who
works for a record company in New York.
My tape? What tape are
you talking about?
The roller rink show. I
recorded the last two tunes.
I never heard it.
Well, I recorded it.
What did it sound like? Why didn't
you tell me? What did it sound like?
You didn't ask.
What did it sound like, Riley?
There's somethin' there.
I mean, that's real.
It's clean and simple, and you
got yourself ahold of somethin'.
That's what I was tryin' to
tell them clowns in Nashville.
Except they didn't listen.
Well, Buddy, I knew it was just a matter
of time before things all came to a head.
Let's face it. You can't make a
life for us out of your hobby.
Music was nice when
we were high school children.
A man can't play at somethin'
his whole life.
What time's the bus? A few minutes.
Take your time.
What a beautiful mornin'.
I wish I'd have worn
my sunglasses.
God.
Unlock the door, Cindy.
Buddy.
Son of a bitch!
Aw, poor thing.
I know it's been
a tough week for you.
But it's all for the best.
I'm sure of it.
Why don't you get my bag, and
we'll go on inside? Go on.
What? Get my bag, and
we'll go on inside.
I just can't wait till
my sorority sisters see you.
You're gonna love it there,
Buddy.
Now, as soon as I get to campus,
I'll have them send you all the information
about enrolling next semester, all right?
Yeah.
All right.
One-way to Austin, please.
Just think.
In less than three years, I'll graduate, and
we can get married and get an apartment.
In less than five years, you'll be out.
We'll both be working. We can buy a house.
I know Daddy'll give us
the down payment.
Buddy, all the things we talked about
ever since we started goin' steady.
How long has that been?
Charles Hardin Holly,
thanks a lot.
We have been going steady exactly five years
ago this weekend, as a matter of fact.
I would appreciate it if you would try
and remember those things in the future.
The bus.
Well, honey, I guess it's been
a good anniversary after all,
things workin' out
like they did.
Don't forget to tell the guys
you're leavin' the band, now.
That's pretty heavy. Could you
put it in the back for her?
Yeah, I'll take care of it.
All right. Thank you.
Watch your step.
Buddy, I always knew you'd come around...
eventually.
Well, I don't think I'm going
to be comin' around eventually.
What? Well, what am I going
to tell the kids at college?
Well, tell 'em,
"Boola-boola."
Have a good time.
Hi, Maria.
How ya doin'?
Hi, Ross. Sorry about all that
studio overtime this month.
I've been chasing after
some new sounds.
Well, if you've got 'em,
I don't care about the money.
If I got 'em,
I wouldn't be apologizing.
Well, all right. That's not what I
wanted to see you about, anyway.
Eddie, I'm thinking of
signing that kid from Texas.
What are you talking about?
Don't you remember? Last month I played
a tape for you by that band from Texas.
You listened to a tune called
"That'll Be The Day" several times.
Yes, and I told you it was the most
unique sound I'd heard in years, right?
Well, I wanted to get your
thoughts about a possible release.
I thought it was a great idea.
That's why I had it released
early this week.
- You pressed the demo?
- You didn't tell me it was a demo.
I assumed you bought a master from
another label, so I had it pressed.
Eddie, I haven't even
signed that kid.
Well, you'd better sign him in
a hurry, 'cause it's selling.
Talk to you later.

I'll have a Dr. Pepper.
I hope you fellas understand we
didn't mean to release your record...
without letting you know first, but our A&R
man liked it so much he just put it on out.
Well, I think it's nice to have a
hit record without a contract. Yes.
Well, that's one of the reasons
I wanted-Thank you, Maria.
That's all right.
We'll get it. Thank you.
Here, let me.
No calls, please.
Hot number?
What's her name? Her name is Maria.
Maria Elena Santiago.
Her aunt is in charge of
our Latin-American division.
She sure is pretty.
You know, fellas, I-Thank you.
I have to confess. I thought
you were a Negro group.
Thank you very much. Wait a minute.
Is that why she was laughing?
Yeah. She's been watching us
go through our whole act,
gearing up to promote
a Negro group from the South.
- I thought she was laughing at me.
- No. Me.
Well, how much money you think
we're going to make on this deal?
Well, now, let's see.
"That'll Be The Day"
will certainly go a million,
and royalties for the three
of you should be around...
$75,000.
I think I can get you part
of that today. 75,000.
Come here. Let's talk about this.
That's $75,000.
Boys, we'll have the best producer
in the business doing your sessions.
Well, here we go again.
I'm the producer of the band.
I have complete say
about our music, and that's it.
Buddy, don't be silly. No artist
has ever been his own producer.
Studio time
costs a lot of money.
Nobody ever gets a record session
handed to them without supervision.
We've been down the supervision
road in Nashville.
Yeah, it was awful, and I'm not
ever going to do it again..
But this is New York. I simply can't put
an artist in charge of his own session.
Look, you may have had problems in Nashville.
I guarantee you...
you'll have
no such problems here.
I guess we won't. What do you say?
Let's go see R.C.A.
All right? Excuse me.
Let's go, boys.
I'm going to produce the records.
I don't give a shit, okay?
Thank you for the Coca-Cola
and the champagne.
The refreshments was real nice.
Buddy, before you go,
please try to understand the recording
business is a very complex affair.
Songwriters come up with a song.
Arrangers decide
how the song will be done.
A performer is chosen
who is right for that song.
Finally, a producer"s charged with putting
all those elements together in a studio.
I can't see why you're so opposed
to having a seasoned pro...
in there with ya
getting the sound we all want.
Because he doesn't know what it is,
and I can't tell him. That's why.
How's he going to produce
what I hear? It starts with me.
Your complex system here-Heck,
it works fine for you guys.
But we're a little band, three pieces.
I write the songs.
There's no formal arrangement.
We'll make a sound together, and when
it feels good, we put it on a tape.
Now, if your producer could do that,
then you'd owe him $75,000, not me.
Is that right?
- Is it right?
- Right.
Right. And nobody's going to make us sound
wrong again. That's all I'm sayin'.
I'd rather shovel shit
in Lubbock. Excuse me.
Buddy, stay here
and make me some hits...
your way.
Okay. I'd be proud to.
Hoo! Let's get this
thing signed up.
Yeah. Let's sign
some checks here.
Damn!
Excuse me.
Mickey, I don't care if they know God
personally. I don't book gospel acts.
What about the Treniers?
How much for five days?
Hold it, Mickey. There's
somethin' wrong with the phone.
Now, what's that price again?
For Christ's sake! I don't want to keep 'em.
I just want to use 'em for a week.
What about Frankie Lymon
and the, Teenagers?
But wait-Hold it, Mickey.
This phone is goin' again.
How much?
Mickey, why don't you
just hold a gun to my head?
You're a rotten bastard, just like Ma said.
Yeah, I'll see ya at home.
What's with you? I'm sorry, boss,
but that Cricket group is here.
Well, you take care of them. I'm busy.
I'll see them tonight.
I think you'll want
to see them now, Sol.
What do I want to see 'em for?
They all look alike to me.
Nothin' personal, Luther.
You know what I mean.
This time I know exactly
what you mean.
Yes, sir,
they does all look alike.
Hey, you fellas,
come on in here for a minute.
Hello.
Shit.
You don't mean to stand there
and tell me you're white.
What are you?
I'm Joe Schmuck. I'm the guy that
booked you without seeing you first.
Thanks for hiring us,
Mr. Schmuck.
What's the big deal
about us bein' white?
I don't know, and I don't intend to be
the first man in history to find out.
- W-What are you talking about?
- No white act has ever played the Apollo!
Suppose somethin' happens.
I'm sorry. I can't take the chance.
Well, then we'll just
take our money and go.
What are you talking about? I'm not
going to pay you without performing.
Your telegram didn't say
nothin' about performing.
It says, "Can you be in New York City
for week of May 2 through 9? Stop.
We'll pay $1,000.
Sol Gittler."
Now, we're going
to be here for a week.
You have my word.
Just what I need-
A gun of Hopalong Cassidy.
Shall we get our instruments? Talk to Luther.
He'll tell you what to do.
Yes, indeed.
- Thank you, sir.
- "White Man Lynched In Harlem."

Yes, and I don't mean

Why not? There's no
point in going into it.
Take my word. I think you're very
sweet, and thank you for the roses.
But now you're about to ask me out, and
I don't-I just can't go out with you.
Wait. Just wait a minute.
Let me explain one thing.
I have never ever
chased after a girl before in my life.
And it feels funny to me. If you're not going
to go out with me, I want to know why.
- You do like me, don't you?
- Yeah. I'm fond of you.
Well, then, what's the holdup?
- My aunt.
- Your aunt? Mrs. Santiago in the publishing depart-
- She doesn't even know me.
- That doesn't matter. You are a musician,
and under no circumstances
am I allowed to go out with a musician.
Let me go talk to her.
I'm sorry.
I'll put on-I'll put on a coat and tie.
It won't do any good.
That's not her only objection,
Buddy, and you know it.
Shit.
What is the other objection?
Look.
I'm Puerto Rican,
and you're-you're not.
Well, I'll change my name
to Chihuahua Garbanzo.
My aunt is very conscious
of these things.
Are you kidding me with
this stuff about your aunt?
You're not kidding?
No.
Maria, I just
went through this...
with people who said that a white act
couldn't play with a colored tour.
We got along fine. We're still getting along.
I don't even know where Puerto Rico is.

Thank you, guys.
That's good.
What's the matter with you?
Come on, Buddy. What is it?
You can tell us.
It's Maria.
Are you kidding?
I thought you had that one made in the shade.
No. It's her aunt.
Her aunt threw me off course a little. Her
aunt forbids her to go out with any musician.
- Can you believe that?
- That is the funniest thing I've ever heard.
Is that what's bugging you? Jesus.
Thanksgiving's right around the corner.

Jesse, you ever say anything

He was only kiddin', Buddy.
Aw, come on.
What the hell was that?
That was a goddamn
stupid thing to say.
Yeah. Well, I-God, he's
getting so temperamental!
Yes? Mrs. Santiago, my
name is Charles Hardin.
I work with Coral Records, and we have
mutual friends in the record business.
I wondered if I could talk to you
if you have a moment to spare?
Yes, I suppose so.
Won't you come in?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
So, can I be of some help
with some business affairs?
Well, not exactly.
It'd probably be better if I
explained my situation first.
That'd be okay?
I'm employed at
the executive offices...
at Coral Records, where I
have a publishing concern,
and through my meetings at the offices
I have met your niece Maria Elena.
And to be honest, I've come
to ask to see her socially.
I see.
Does Maria know
that you are here?
No, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am.
Well, Mr., Hardin? Yes, ma'am.
I must say, very few young men today
have the courtesy that you display.
Some people might think getting
permission to court...
is very old-fashioned.
Well, I've never done it before,
but, I've never met anyone
quite like Maria either.
There's no one like Maria.
And I must say, you do seem
like a fine young man.
Very rare in the music business
these days, you know.
Yes, ma'am, and that's the main
reason I came was to let you know...
what my intentions are
with Maria.
That they're good intentions.
Okay.
I'm very glad we have this talk.
Well, so am I, Miss Santiago.
Maria has talked
about you a lot,
and I'm really glad that I took
the opportunity to meet you.
And the only thing I hope is that I
haven't been too bold in the process.
No.
The important thing...
is that you think enough of my
Maria to have gone to this effort.
She would like to see you sometime,
it would be fine with me.
That's great. That really makes me happy.
I'm going to tell her right now.
To tell you the truth, I got a big
kick out of the whole thing myself.
And, Buddy?
You were very good
in American Bandstand.
I would have given anything to see
the look on my aunt's face...
when you asked her
if you could take me out.
What lies did you tell? No lies. I
told her my name was Charles Hardin,
which it is, and everything I told
your aunt had the ring of truth in it.
Well, she still thinks
you're crazy, but harmless.
Well, I am crazy,
but not harmless.
She can't believe I want to go out with you.
I can't either.
It will never last.
What won't?
Look around. This looks like a
convention for seeing eye dogs.
This 3-D is just a flash
in the pan, I predict.
Well, my aunt says our dating won't last.
She's right.
What? Hey, fella! You going
to watch the movie or what?
I think I'll "what."
Would you like to "what" with me?
Let's go "whatting."
Excuse me, cowboy.
Thank you.
Hold this.
This is special?
This is real special.
Well-I only do this
on special occasions.
Don't do this too much.
You're littering my rooftop.
I figured out why
they call this Tar Beach.
Yeah? 'Cause all the tar is on
the other side of the roof.
It's the only place you can get
a tan in the summer, you know?
To Maria Elena Holly.
Okay.
Where were we
just before Tar Beach?
Where were we?
You were going to Maryland
to get married.
And you?
I wasn't going to Maryland. How am I
going to get married without you?
We're going to have enough problems
with our families without eloping.
We won't have any problems with any families.
I'll take care of all that.
Everything will be fine.
It's not that simple.
My folks will love you.
I don't know.
Yes, they will.
If I do, they will. And I'm
not marrying your aunt.
I'm Catholic.
I'm a Texan.

Ever since we were kids, you've been saying
you were going to get a new Caddie before 21.
You almost made it, old man. Well,
fellas, I hate to break up your fun.
But I got a manager in the
back, and he'd like to know...
if you're going to purchase this
car or just sit this one out?
Why don't you tell your manager we're going to

don't you get the car there?

Look, maybe you could get us some other dates
on Sullivan? What's the matter with Jesse?
Just get us some different dates.
How much money do we need?
Ray Bob, it's not the money.
It's what we've been working on
since Lubbock, since the garage.
You can't change the date, 'cause it's
a holiday show. It's Christmastime.
It's geared
for the younger audiences.
What's the matter with you guys?
You're acting like old women.
I thought you'd be thrilled about this.
This is national television.
Shit.
Yeah, I guess
we should be thrilled.
I'll talk to Jesse about it,
and I guess we'll do the show.
But Buddy, after this,
let's take a breather.
Shit.
What's the holdup? We're
an hour off schedule.
It's now two hours.
It's that Holly kid.
Now he's got us
settin' up four mikes.
♪♪ D, A, D, A. One and two
and three and four.
Hey, hey, hey!
We have to finish rehearsing. That's a wrap.
I have other acts that have to rehearse.
I'm sorry. That's it. When are we
going to get to finish rehearsing?
If we don't fall further behind, we just might
have one dress rehearsal before we air.
Okay, let's strike the set!
Where are the bears?
Where are the Polish bears?
Will one of you guys
bring in the bear cages?
I want to see the juggler,
the acrobats and the magician.
She said 44-D. I thought-
- Well, all right.
- Hey, rock 'n' roll!
How do I look? You look wonderful.
I don't mind if I do.
Where you been? We had a
chance to rehearse again.
God, brother. Will you leave the music alone?
It sounds great.
Well, we just had a chance to rehearse.
That's all.
- You're drunk.
- I'll probably just play better.
Don't you ever relax?
I am relaxed.
Well, I'm so relaxed I met a chorus girl
a while ago. Listen, why don't you-.
- Don't fool with me.
- Jesse, why don't you get dressed?
Hey, y'all, cut it out!
Jesus! You all right?
Shit.
Bull's-eye.
Ten minutes, boys.
What are we going to do?
Why don't you go get me some gum?
It's just these caps.
And now, for all you youngsters,
Buddy Holly and the Crickets!

Right now, on our stage from
Poland, the Kolo Dancing Bears!
I'm going on back up to the hotel
and change.
See you.
Yo te quiero.
Did you hear me?
No.
I said, "Te quiero."
"Te quiero"?
What does that mean?
I said, "I love you because
you have true love ways."
"True love ways."
That's really pretty.
When are you going to put
the bed in the bedroom?
I don't know. I kind of like this.
Don't you?
The neighbors.
They'll never see us.
I love you.
I love you, Maria.
Well, all right.
What do you think? It's great. What
do you think of this? "Buddy Holly"?
I love that. I just hope it
does as well as the last one.
What do you mean? I want to
speak to you about this letter.
I want to know if you fully understand
that with this letter to your-.
Thank you, Judith-
With this letter to your lawyer,
you give away the full rights
to the name "the Crickets."
Yeah. I know that. Buddy, the
public has a very short memory.
They forget in 20 minutes. Believe me on
this. Without the Crickets on that label,
you could be throwing away
your whole livelihood.
When the guys went back to Lubbock, we
decided they'd take the name "The Crickets."
And we all gave our word on it.
That's it.
It's not too late.
We could reprint the label.
No. It's over and done with.
They got it, and that's it.
All right. I guess we can keep the
momentum going by doing promotion...
and footwork on the record
in all the major markets,
and we'll try to get all
the TV exposure we can.
That's great. And I want
you to go out on tour.
Well, now, wait a minute.
I've been on tour a lot, and I'd just
kind of like to stay around the house.
Stay around the house?
What are you going to do? Walk
your dog and mow your hallway?
No. Hell,
I don't have a dog.
I'm not going to do that. I just want
to spend some time with the old lady.
Take her on the road with you. No.
No. Can't take her on the road.
That's crazy.
I'd rather do TV, do some...
I don't know, some other kind of
promotion rather than playing.
I want to produce. Let's get in
the studio and make some hits.
Excuse me. Mr. Holly? Yeah.
Yeah, I believe I was
contracted to play some violin.
That's right. As soon as I
finish this rhythm track,
I want to put some strings
under the vocal.
Here are your charts.
Myself
and Mr. Schwartz...
have played in some of the
finest orchestras in the world,
and I don't know if we can
play that kind of music.
Will the violins
go with rock 'n' roll?
Well, I don't know. Why don't we
give it a try? The scale's the same.
What do you say?
Buddy, I hate to come in here
and sing that same old song,
but we're spending a fortune on this album and
you've got to give us some help promoting it.
Granted, you've done great things producing
other acts for us, and I really appreciate it-
Okay, Ross-Ross, Ross. But
we're in a recession now, and-.
Hold it a minute. Let me finish this
mixing, and we can talk tomorrow.
Okay. This is important. I want to
get it straight. When and where?
I know it is important, and we'll do
it tomorrow at lunch at my place.
I'll have Maria do somethin'.
Okay. What time?
2:00. Lunch, 2:00 tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to it. See you then.
We'll fix it. I promise.
You know something, young man?
Young man, this is very clever.
Where you have the strings
playing a pizzicato...
just to make it sound
like the raindrops.
Do you know something? Beethoven did the very
same thing in one of his pieces, yes, he did.
Beethoven himself did it in his pieces, yes.
I didn't know that.
Yes, he did. Of course, he was
very deaf at the time he did it.
Is he serious?
Beethoven?
Think the fiddle players
been smokin' their bows.
Would you run that back for me? I want
to do it again, have another shot at it.
Okay. Let's hear it.
Super.
Absolutely delicious.
What do you call that?
Tuna fish.
Well, it was terrific.
You know something?
You're a better cook than you were a secretary;
Not that you weren't a good secretary.
That's okay, Mr. Turner. You're a
better eater than you were a boss.
Did you talk like this
to him when he was your boss?
Are you kidding? She used to boss me around.
And Maria, do me a favor.
Don't call me Mr. Turner. Will you
do me a favor? Call me Mrs. Holly.
You want some coffee, Ross?
I'd love some, Mrs. Holly.
Thank you, Maria.
Here's my plate.
Thank you.
Buddy, I just don't know
how to say this anymore...
But for some reason-
Who knows why-
an act has got to go out on
the road to promote a record.
Otherwise, it just doesn't sell,
no matter how good it is.
My records are selling.
Overseas, maybe. But not so much here.
I got three records on the charts.
Nothing in the top ten. With your help,
you could've pushed 'em to number one.
You make the best records in the business,
but if the public doesn't hear your music,
why bother recording?
What kind of tour
did you have in mind?
There's only one tour
left in the season.
It starts next month, and it covers every
major city in the Midwest on a five-week run.
That's a winter tour.
I don't think so. I think I'll have wait till spring.
- It's only five weeks.
What are you looking at me
that way for?
Because she knows I'm right.
Boy, this record business.
I got it all around me.
Well, I don't want to go on this tour,
and right or wrong, I ain't goin'.
Maria! Maria,
what are you doing?
I can't understand you.
What are you doing?
Just hold it a minute. Let
me finish this work. Please?
Thank you.
What time is it?
6:30.
God, I feel like I've been
doing this for three weeks.
That's all I need
if this is Ross Turner.
Mr. Holly?
Yes, sir?
He broke my new guitar.
Will you fix it?
Well, come on in. Come on in.
Shut this door here.
Come over here with me. Let's
sit down, and I shall fix it.
This looks like a Christmas present.
It is.
Did you break this guy's guitar?
I did not. He's a liar.
You did so.
Well, I think it's just
out of tune a little bit.
I tune it up.
It'll be good as new.
Here you go. Good as new. See?
- Why don't you play me one of your hits?
- I just got it.
Do you know any chords?
No.
I'll teach you some. You want to learn some?
Let's learn the "E" chord.
I'll show you one of the first songs
I ever "writ" with the "E" chord.

Let's do another one.
Want some popcorn? No, we
got to go and eat dinner.
Yeah? Bye. Bye.
Okay. Bye.

Bye.

Just about had me a trio again.
Except they was a little short.
How are you feeling? How is that
baby doing down under there?
Buddy?
What?
You know, I don't care if you
never go back on the road,
but I don't want to see you
making yourself miserable.
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
I'm talking about
this game you're playing.
I don't want to talk
about that anymore.
Okay.
Buddy, I'm your wife. Why
don't you talk to me?
I'm scared. You're scared?
Of what?
About going out on the road without the
Crickets. I've played with them all my life.
I grew up playing with them. I wrote
my first songs with them, the hits.
I don't mind bombing with them, but I can't stand
the thought of falling on my ass without them.
I know how much you miss them, but
you don't need them for your music.
Where would you be today,
right now,
if you'd let your fears
stop you?
Come here.
Probably shoveling shit
back in Lubbock.
While I'm gone, don't forget to
walk the dog and mow the hallway.
What?
Or maybe we could get a goat or something.
Sure. Wait here and let
me put this guitar up.
Hey, Dion, take this for me.
I'll be right there.
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you too.
Sounds like a song.
Will you still love me
when I'm fat?
Yeah.
Why shouldn't I?
You're not
going to see this change,
and you're going
to be shocked in two months.
Well, I probably will.
Walk me to the bus.
Come on.
I know what to do, though. You send me a
picture of yourself every day, naked.
Like just out of the shower
or something.
And then I'll get used
to you and him. Her.
Come here.
Take care of yourself, Mama.
Buena suerte.
Yo! Y'all ready to rock? Rock 'n' roll!
You know what I like!
Hello. Come here.
Give me a kiss.
Listen. Send me those pictures. I'll
sell them to the guys on the bus.
We'll make a bunch of money
to send him through college.
I love you.

Hi, Maria. Jesse. Thank you.
God. Come on in.
I- You just missed Buddy's call.
Aw, damn it! You don't know how
much he misses the two of you.
Well, we got a pretty good
idea, but it's good to hear.
Yeah. Well, I guess that's
all we have to know.
All you have to know for what? We were
going to fly to lowa and surprise Buddy.
But then we thought maybe he
didn't want to get back together.
So we thought we'd better come up
here and check it out with you.
I don't think there's anything in the world
he'd want more than to have you guys back.
Well, all right!
Where does the show go next?
Hand me my book.
Let me check.
Let's see.
Clearlake tonight.
Tomorrow night, it's
M-M-Moorhead, Minnesota, 8:00.
That's it. We're going to
be there with bells on.

introduce myself to you.
I'm J.P. Richardson. I'm a disc
jockey from Beaumont, Texas.
And I'd like to introduce you to a
fellow Texan, a good friend of mine...
and a good friend of yours,
Mr. Buddy Holly!
Thank you, J.P.
Appreciate it.
Hello.
How you doin'?
Man, I feel pretty good.
I just talked to my wife.
Let's do "True Love Ways" first,
"True Love Ways."
Thank you very much. It's good
to be in Clearlake, lowa.
It's pretty cold
up here, though.
Ho. I haven't done this in a while.
I'm a little nervous,
so I'm going to play the hardest thing
I know for someone real special.
