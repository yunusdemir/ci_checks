<b>- Go.
- Beverly Hills.</b>
<b>This place sucks.</b>
<b>You think it sucks now?
You should have seen it before the quake.</b>
<b>Is that your contact?</b>
<b>- Damn it. Copy.
- This is Hammond.</b>
<b>What the hell are you doing in the Zone?
No, don't answer that.</b>
<b>You got some action coming your way.</b>
<b>Yeah, what kind of action?</b>
<b>It's Dext Muldoon.</b>
<b>You want to take me now or later.</b>
<b>He's in around the dispensary.</b>
<b>We manage to track his vehicle.
We'll be there in 2 minutes.</b>
<b>Be where?</b>
<b>Aye, this guy is just right
where you're standing.</b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>- Go after Dext!
- Copy.</b>
<b>Central is a quarantine boundary.</b>
<b>Gimme the melard.
Give the overwrite code.</b>
<b>Shut it down.</b>
<b>Got it.</b>
<b>Huh, huh, huh, huh.</b>
<b>What's so funny asshole?</b>
<b>You're dead.</b>
<b>How many of you officers
have been in this zone before?</b>
<b>That's what I thought. Rookies.</b>
<b>Yeah, it's about time the rookies
busted good cherries in this zone.</b>
<b>Except for you Hammond,
you don't have a cherry.</b>
<b>We're heading into Level 3.
So I have Level 3 protection.</b>
<b>We have counters and breathers on standby.
I don't think we'll be needing em.</b>
<b>Why are they radioactive?</b>
<b>Well the quake took out 3 local
power stations. Fusion reactors.</b>
<b>Fortunately there wasn't a full meltdown.
But they did release some of the bad stuff.</b>
<b>Who the hell would want to live there?</b>
<b>Do the math.
It's like Club Med for criminals.</b>
<b>Some of the people there
don't have a choice.</b>
<b>Entering the dead zone, Sir.</b>
<b>When we hit the ground,
the target is Dexts Muldoon.</b>
<b>The locals consider him to
be some kind of Che Guevara.</b>
<b>Do not be fooled. Take him out.</b>
<b>You take out a one-fifth
of the drug trading zone.</b>
<b>Two minutes landing, Sir.</b>
<b>Let's buck it up.</b>
<b>Check the cameras.
Jones, you're good.</b>
<b>Poschek, good.</b>
<b>Jackson, good.</b>
<b>Hammond! Hammond,
you're not transmitting.</b>
<b>Need another, Sarge.</b>
<b>Little easier to transmit
and I've got a camera, Sarge.</b>
<b>Right. Hammond you're good.</b>
<b>- Looks like we got company.
- Really small fry though.</b>
<b>We'll take care of them.</b>
<b>Gentlemen, start your countdown.</b>
<b>- Yes sir. This is it.
- Let's go.</b>
<b>Too exposed.
We're going through.</b>
<b>What's wrong with her?</b>
<b>She's got ..ginmars..
Radiation poisoning.</b>
<b>Stay too long in the zone,
it can get pretty nasty.</b>
<b>You already had all your kids, right?</b>
<b><i>Jones.</i></b>
<b>- That ain't him.
- Keep moving.</b>
<b>That is not our objective.</b>
<b>Woh, woh, woh, woh. Back up.</b>
<b>Yeah, I'm talking to you.</b>
<b>Uh, uh, go on sit down, big fella.
We ain't here for you.</b>
<b>You wouldn't have set up your command
centre a few blocks away if you were.</b>
<b>Think we didn't see you.</b>
<b>Look, we don't care about your business,
alright. We just want safe passage.</b>
<b>You have no authority here.</b>
<b>- What do you want?
- Come again.</b>
<b>You need anything?
Medical supplies?</b>
<b>If there's something from the outside world
that you need, I can get it delivered to you.</b>
<b>- Mills?
- You copy me sir.</b>
<b>Good.</b>
<b>So if you need anything,
have one of your man</b>
<b>contact Sergeant Mills down
at the Command Centre.</b>
<b>And if it's something we
can get, he'll get it for you.</b>
<b>You have my word.</b>
<b>All we ask, is to
pass through quietly.</b>
<b>And what if I don't agree?</b>
<b>- Dammit Hammond! Nicoles call for backup.
- Yes sir.</b>
<b>What if what I want
isn't actually legal?</b>
<b>Go on.</b>
<b>Something from your
evidence room, perhaps.</b>
<b>Come on man.
Do we look like crooked cops to you?</b>
<b>Don't answer that.</b>
<b>Iodine tablets, liquid form too. Cypro,
scotch two cases, hypodermic needles,</b>
<b>entry cases of Mexican, Coca Cola.</b>
<b>- The kind with the real sugar?
- Huh, huh, huh.</b>
<b>I can't get my hands on that...
I mean we can't...</b>
<b>That was my joke.</b>
<b>- Mills you got that?
- Got it!</b>
<b>Sir, you still need that backup?</b>
<b>Yeah, they're not
even in the building yet.</b>
<b>- We got a deal.
- Good.</b>
<b>Freeze!</b>
<b>Alright, let's papparazi that bitch.</b>
<b>Muldoon, this is the police.</b>
<b>We know you're in there and
we have the place surrounded.</b>
<b>- Mills, see anything?
- Yeah, an ... woman.</b>
<b>Searching.</b>
<b>Over there!</b>
<b>Damn it Jones. Report!</b>
<b>Police. See your hands.</b>
<b>I want you to come out.</b>
<b>Come on. Let's go.
Move, move, move, move.</b>
<b>Out. Move.</b>
<b>I'd like to do it all, baby.
Remember that.</b>
<b>Oh shit!</b>
<b>Hammond's gone lone wolf again.</b>
<b>Damn it.
You gotta wait for back up.</b>
<b>You called for back up.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>You're dead.</b>
<b>How the hell did you ...?
Doesn't matter.</b>
<b>You have 2 dead cops on your hands.
Do you really want that?</b>
<b>You're in no position to negotiate.</b>
<b>Who said this is a negotiation.</b>
<b>Put down your weapon.</b>
<b>What you gonna do?
You gonna blow both of us up?</b>
<b>Dexts Muldoon, you are under arrest.</b>
<b>You come any closer
and I'll blow his brains out.</b>
<b>Sir, your handheld has been
approved for destruction.</b>
<b>This is not negotiable.
Put down your weapon.</b>
<b>- Who the hell is this guy?
- I have no idea.</b>
<b>You have 3 choices.
Surrender and live.</b>
<b>Shoot Sergeant Hammond and die.</b>
<b>Shoot me and die.
Make a choice.</b>
<b>Fuck you!</b>
<b>Marks, Jackson on me!</b>
<b>Now, what the hell was that?</b>
<b>Did you not see me
pointing the gun at him?</b>
<b>What were you doing?
You almost killed me.</b>
<b>Negative.</b>
<b>There is a 73% probability that this
individual would had terminated you</b>
<b>if I had not interceded.</b>
<b>Interceding.
You call that interceding.</b>
<b>If I had not interjected you would
have been destroyed, Sergeant Hammond.</b>
<b>Oh, would I. Ok. Let's see how you like
a grenade blowing up over your head.</b>
<b>He had this on him.
He had a concealed weapon.</b>
<b>Did anybody frisk him?
God damn it.</b>
<b>- You scanned him, right?
- I followed all operational procedures.</b>
<b>Yeah, but you followed them loosely.</b>
<b>Would you like to file
a complaint, Sergeant?</b>
<b>Well, if it is in the form of
punch you in the face, then, yeah.</b>
<b>I would advise against it.</b>
<b>Yeah, I bet you would Mr. Roboto.</b>
<b>One more thing. Who sent you?</b>
<b>I received a request for back up.
I provided back up.</b>
<b>- What the hell was that?
- Our future.</b>
<b>Well, the professionals finally
showed up. How about that?</b>
<b>- Oh, you're in this. Over here.
- Thank you.</b>
<b>- Hey, that's not for you.
- The hell it ain't.</b>
<b>- I made a deal.
- Well, sometimes life ain't always fair.</b>
<b>Tell me we're not in
the wrong run of business.</b>
<b>It's not just wrong.</b>
<b>Chief! Chief!
I'd like to report an incident.</b>
<b>Hammond. I heard all about it.</b>
<b>No, I'm not talking about the suspect.
I'm talking about that supercop.</b>
<b>- Supercop?
- Yeah, you know the guy I'm talking about.</b>
<b>That skin job. That psychopatic soda
machine. That things of men...</b>
<b>Hammond, before you go too far,
I want you to meet your new partner.</b>
<b>Will you give us a minute?</b>
<b>That means, move out of the way.</b>
<b>I know you don't like it, Hammond,
but you're the best man for it.</b>
<b>Well, assuming I've forgotten
about today's nifty events,</b>
<b>after what happened out
there with that autogun</b>
<b>do you think I'd be happy to take
a position anywhere near a machine.</b>
<b>It's an android.</b>
<b>Well, I don't care what you call it.
It's still a machine.</b>
<b>You know how you sound when
you say you don't like machines?</b>
<b>Look.
Somebody programmed that thing.</b>
<b>Just like somebody programmed
that autogun to stop intruders,</b>
<b>yet it missed our call sign, a secure
call sign. And they call it a malfunction.</b>
<b>A god damn hiccup.
That was a human life.</b>
<b>I know.</b>
<b>That's why I want you near it.</b>
<b>There's a lot more at stake here
than just your personal feelings.</b>
<b>That android, skin job,
whatever you want to call it</b>
<b>it represents just the first wave
of many, many more to come.</b>
<b>And unlike what we're used to,
they don't require human operators.</b>
<b>The brass says that we have to
give this thing a field test... a dry run.</b>
<b>- You gonna be reporting on that dry run.
- What?</b>
<b>Listen, listen. Listen to me.</b>
<b>This thing could signify the end of
human involvement in law enforcement.</b>
<b>Is that what you want?</b>
<b>Or on the other hand if it should
just happen to wash out, so be it.</b>
<b>Frankly, I think people would be a lot
happier with officers such as yourself,</b>
<b>rather than those things.</b>
<b>Hammond!</b>
<b>I'd like to formally introduce you to.</b>
<b>Advance Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid</b>
<b>I One.</b>
<b>Advance autonomous... look,
that's too long. I'll call you Andy.</b>
<b>- You could call me Officer One.
- Sure.</b>
<b>- How do you do?
- Do what?</b>
<b>This thing's gonna be
interacting with the public?</b>
<b>You can take that one right there.
Do you even need to sit?</b>
<b>I can sit or stand.</b>
<b>You might as well sit down, unless
you want me to hang my jacket on you.</b>
<b>I'm not here for your
amusement, Sergent Hammond.</b>
<b>If you would like me to ask for another
partner, I would be very happy to.</b>
<b>Wait a minute.
Did you ask for me as a partner?</b>
<b>Affirmative.</b>
<b>And why would you do that?</b>
<b>It was suggested to me that our
compatibility index would be high.</b>
<b><i>You might as well try
that coffee maker over there.</i></b>
<b>Do you think internal affairs sent him?</b>
<b>No, we got them some bitches locked up
tightly in a froze ass in a tsunami.</b>
<b>- No, he's not working for IA.
- Who's he working for then?</b>
<b>He's working for us.
Just don't know it yet.</b>
<b>We're getting our first assignment.</b>
<b><i>Hammond, you're up.</i></b>
<b><i>We got a report of
a jumper over at 7th Street.</i></b>
<b><i>All the boys are tied up downtown.
Can you handle that?</i></b>
<b>I'm on it.</b>
<b>Do me a favour. Next time you get wind
of a call, let me know what it is first.</b>
<b>This guy, ruining my day.</b>
<b>I have to show this building today.</b>
<b>Do you know him?</b>
<b>Yeah. His name is Jake Wescott.
Lives on the 5th floor.</b>
<b>You know. Comes and goes.
Kind of quiet.</b>
<b>So he's never excited
to jump off the roof before.</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>With your permission
I would like to go alone.</b>
<b>Hell, no.</b>
<b>My programming
addresses these scenarios.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah. He's going to feel real
worthwhile when we send a robot</b>
<b>or android out to talk to him.
That says we really care.</b>
<b>I'm not following you.</b>
<b>I've gone through several instances
like this in multiple simulations.</b>
<b>See, those were simulations.
This is real life.</b>
<b>There is a greater probability
for success if I were to go</b>
<b>against someone such as yourself.</b>
<b>"Such as myself", what
is that suppose to mean?</b>
<b>Sorry guys.
Sorry to interrupt the guys big moment.</b>
<b>Hey! You want me to cite you?</b>
<b>Andy, you stay right here.</b>
<b>- Mr Wescott.
- That's far enough.</b>
<b>- I'm not here to stop you Mr Wescott.
- Right.</b>
<b>I only want to ask you
a couple of questions.</b>
<b>Not really in the mood for questions.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah. I can see that.</b>
<b>But Mr Wescott, are you by
any chance an organ donor?</b>
<b>As you may know, organ donation
has saved countless lives and</b>
<b>don't you think it's a good thing to
consider from a man in your situation.</b>
<b>Most people your age who donate
their organs are in terrible accidents</b>
<b>and not all of their
organs are even useful.</b>
<b>But you're clearly in
good physical condition.</b>
<b>Would be shame,
don't you think.</b>
<b>I'm not going to donate my organs.</b>
<b>Mr Wescott, if you just
allow me to make the call,</b>
<b>I can get organ harvesters
over here in 5 minutes.</b>
<b>They can euthanize you
in a humane manner.</b>
<b>They can be painless. Then we can get your
organs out to somebody who really use them.</b>
<b>You're insane!</b>
<b>Wow. Can you imagine the sensation
of impact from a fall from this height?</b>
<b>Give me a moment.</b>
<b>I told you to stay back.</b>
<b>- We can go now.
- What are you talking about?</b>
<b>The situation no longer
requires our presence.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I've performed a micro-expression analysis
on the subject. He will not hurt himself.</b>
<b>Try telling that to the...</b>
<b>In addition I've initiated plan
to defuse the situation.</b>
<b>Okay. What is it?</b>
<b>I accessed his phone records.</b>
<b>The majority were to an
individual who was not responding.</b>
<b>Okay, so the woman...
you, go on.</b>
<b>I sent text from each other
with the data required to bring</b>
<b>equilibrium to their social interaction.</b>
<b>Ok. So you text at him pretending to
be her and her pretending to be him.</b>
<b>So you lied.</b>
<b>Each of them received the information
needed to restore their pair bonding.</b>
<b>Pair bonding?</b>
<b>I have access to her files.</b>
<b>Your postrate and moral
superiority in questioning</b>
<b>the legality of my method is suspect,</b>
<b>when you proposed
to euthanize our subject.</b>
<b>Hey, its been legal
in the state since 2024.</b>
<b>Did you consider
the consequences that</b>
<b>the subject were to take
you up on your proposal.</b>
<b>Yes, his organs.
Let me ask you a question.</b>
<b>What happens when they realize
that they didn't text each other.</b>
<b>The outcome depends
on the amount of time</b>
<b>that has transpired
before this interaction.</b>
<b>The further the time
the greater the probabilty</b>
<b>that they will
maintain the equilibrium.</b>
<b>Would like to hear
the probability matrix?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Just remind me to keep you from
interacting with anyone I know.</b>
<b>- We're getting another call.
- Could you please stop that?</b>
<b>Hammond you got a
missing persons case for you.</b>
<b>See, that's why I told you to
tell me what it is before we...</b>
<b>Ah, yeah. Why put us on?</b>
<b>You've gotta keep it low profile
for now, it's complicated.</b>
<b>Yes, um. I'm walking around with a
400 pound black robot with a white head.</b>
<b>How low profile do you think we are?</b>
<b>Look, you've been personally requested
by the mayor's office. Just do it!</b>
<b>- Sergeant Hammond.
- Stones.</b>
<b>And this is?</b>
<b>Advanced Autonomous Artificial Intelligence
Neuralnet Law Enforcement Droid I One.</b>
<b>Andy.</b>
<b>I get it.</b>
<b>The mayor's very busy but he is
concerned about his daughter.</b>
<b>So, the mayor has a daughter?</b>
<b>Yes, now this wasn't public
knowledge until recently but</b>
<b>when the quake devastated LA,</b>
<b>the mayor sent his then infant daughter
to Brazil to live with her mother.</b>
<b>He and his wife were estranged.</b>
<b>When she passed away, his
daughter returned to Los Angeles.</b>
<b>So is she the one who is missing?</b>
<b>Not exactly.</b>
<b>Your domestics?</b>
<b>All androids like him.
It's a full tissue for us.</b>
<b>Not as autonomous or as advanced,
they work off a program scripts.</b>
<b>Robos.</b>
<b>The mayor's daughter,
Helen Jacobs.</b>
<b>Well, if she's not missing, who is?</b>
<b>Her body. She's connected
to a telepresence port.</b>
<b>You're familiar with the concept.</b>
<b>Oh yes. Robots are androids remotely
controlled to human brain waves.</b>
<b>Pioneered by ACI Corporation
for dangerous military operations.</b>
<b>Working in environments
that are not suitable for humans.</b>
<b>Yes, as you are aware,
Detective Hammond,</b>
<b>the success on the battlefields
led to many applications.</b>
<b>They can give the wounded
a new lease on life, a new mobility,</b>
<b>and freedom from their mortal bodies.</b>
<b>So she is connected via
telepresence robot right now.</b>
<b>An android. One so sophisticated
it can pass through your eye.</b>
<b>So why don't we just wake
her up and ask her where it is?</b>
<b>It's not so simple.</b>
<b>She suffered catasprophic injuries in
her accident, and she went into a coma.</b>
<b>Now we were able to connect her to
an android body, but here's the kicker.</b>
<b>She's not aware it is in her own body.</b>
<b>She is not aware of her telepresence.</b>
<b>Is that illegal?</b>
<b>I'm told that the shock of waking up
and making such a discovery could be</b>
<b>devastating to her.
Could lead to a psychotic break.</b>
<b>As far as she is concerned, she had an
accident and she made it out just fine.</b>
<b>How could she not know?</b>
<b>The conscious mind believes what
it wants to believe, Detective.</b>
<b>And you cannot track
her telepresence droid.</b>
<b>She's gone outside the Grid.</b>
<b>We believe she's gone into one
of the deconstructed zones,</b>
<b>that's where you come in.</b>
<b>You can go in there
with no problems.</b>
<b>Well so, if I go in there
and I find her, what then?</b>
<b>I mean she hasn't
committed any crimes.</b>
<b>Secure her and bring her back here.</b>
<b>Now under no circumstances
is she to be told what she is.</b>
<b>Now if Helen wakes up here,
we'll handle that.</b>
<b>But otherwise, she is just
a normal 24 year old woman.</b>
<b>Who happens to be an android.</b>
<b>Not 'be' one, 'existing' one.
You know the difference?</b>
<b><i>This zone is off limits.</i></b>
<b>So what happened to her?</b>
<b>That's not relevant to this case and</b>
<b>the mayor doesn't want
that information out there.</b>
<b>Well, it might help us find her.</b>
<b>Trust me, it won't.</b>
<b>Is there something
in her personality</b>
<b>that will make you think she
will be drawn to the Zones?</b>
<b>Listen. The mayor and his daughter
don't always see eye to eye.</b>
<b>She's a bit of an activist.</b>
<b>When she got injured, we think she was in
the zones under the guise of some crusade.</b>
<b>People being exploited
are her pet causes.</b>
<b>Her father has enemies
on all sides of the law.</b>
<b>If she went there under the
guise of some idealogical crusade,</b>
<b>she could have run into somebody that
would hurt her just to get to her father.</b>
<b>Well, even if they did run into
her, what could they do to her?</b>
<b>I mean, her real body is right here
and the other one is an android.</b>
<b>No of fence Andy, but you know
what people do with androids.</b>
<b>Manual labour, soldiers,
domestics, sex slaves.</b>
<b>The mayor's daughter,
turned into a sex slave?</b>
<b>Look even if it's
for your telepresence,</b>
<b>that's something that we don't
even want to imagine, Detective.</b>
<b>Find her, before they do.</b>
<b>We could check the
underground markets.</b>
<b>That won't be necessary.</b>
<b>If she has been abducted, someone
with her attributes could end up there.</b>
<b>And did you notice her
attributes, oh it's not that,</b>
<b>I know somebody that
could help us find her.</b>
<b>Porter, Porter, Porter.</b>
<b>What is this?
Official business?</b>
<b>Yes. Have you seen this woman?</b>
<b>What makes you think
I can help you with that?</b>
<b>Don't bullshit me, Porter.
I can make it worth your while.</b>
<b>I would not be in business if I turn
people over to anyone offering me a buck.</b>
<b>You see, I'm not offering you a buck,
partner. I'm offering you your freedom.</b>
<b>How can you offer me
something I already got?</b>
<b>See my partner, here?</b>
<b>He's not like you and me.</b>
<b>See, he's an android.</b>
<b>That means, you take the
empathy of a regular person,</b>
<b>a normal person. And you
divide that by that, say, 20,000.</b>
<b>And you still won't be able to touch
his level of not giving a ground.</b>
<b>And you're telling me this, why?</b>
<b>Here's where I'm gonna help you,</b>
<b>See, he doesn't give a damn about you.</b>
<b>See, he can look deep into your
shit, if you know what I mean.</b>
<b>No, I don't.</b>
<b>Your business, Porter.
He could look deep into it.</b>
<b>Andy, show him what
I'm talking about.</b>
<b>I'm assessing his records.</b>
<b>I can find nothing that
substantiates filing charges.</b>
<b>Woh, what about his bank records?</b>
<b>I'm sure embezzlement might offer up some
numerical residue that we can sniff into.</b>
<b>This individual is clean.
He pays his bills.</b>
<b>His deposits matches
employer records.</b>
<b>I do show that he is
expecting a tax refund.</b>
<b>- Give us a minute.
- Absolutely.</b>
<b>Look. You need to go
along with me on this, okay?</b>
<b>You know those text
messages that you falsified?</b>
<b>I do not see how threatening
this individual help our case.</b>
<b>Preferable tactic would
be to get in his trust.</b>
<b>Well, you need to do a
little in getting my trust.</b>
<b>Are you looking for results</b>
<b>or are using this interaction as an
outlet for suppressed aggression?</b>
<b>Results. Watch me.</b>
<b>Listen, asshole.</b>
<b>I know people like you
provide guide services</b>
<b>for people going in
and out of the zone.</b>
<b>Oh yeah, that's...</b>
<b>Damn! That is illegal.
That violates the quarantine.</b>
<b>This woman has been in and
out of this zone quite often.</b>
<b>Clearly, someone has helped her.</b>
<b>Not by me.</b>
<b>Is that right?</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Then tell me, some other
operators. Give me their names.</b>
<b>That's beyond my scope.</b>
<b>What are you doing?</b>
<b>This is not working.</b>
<b>Oh, okay. You're trying to
play good cop, bad cop.</b>
<b>Good cop, bad cop.</b>
<b>- Yeah, it's where one of us...
- I'm familiar with the technique.</b>
<b>Oh, are you? Well, you're doing
a good job at playing mediocre cop.</b>
<b>I tell you what.
You need me, I'll be at the bar.</b>
<b>Please accept the apology of the
Police Department for Officer Hammond.</b>
<b>He's experiencing difficulties.</b>
<b>Oh yeah. Well, that's no excuse
for roughing somebody up.</b>
<b>Of course it isn't.
Would you like to file charges?</b>
<b>That, ah, isn't necessary.</b>
<b>I'm equipped to accept verbal
statements for filing charges.</b>
<b>Look, I ..
I don't want to file charges.</b>
<b>Are you afraid he may retaliate?</b>
<b>No. No, no, no, no.
See, it's not my way. Okay.</b>
<b>I don't file charges against cops.
Uh, uh.</b>
<b>Are you at all afraid of the police?</b>
<b>Would you like to add
that to your statement?</b>
<b>No. God damn it, man! What's...</b>
<b>If you are threatened by the police
at any time, we can offer protection.</b>
<b>I don't need protection.</b>
<b>Hey look, I'm sorry.
He's malfunctioning.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>All system scans are
at acceptable levels.</b>
<b>No, there's something wrong. We
need to get back to HQ. Let's go.</b>
<b>You're interfering with
an ongoing investigation.</b>
<b>It is against departmental code.</b>
<b>We need to go.</b>
<b>You are pursuing unlawful behaviour.</b>
<b>Well then, write me up.
File charges. Let's go.</b>
<b>You can leave.
I'm continuing this investigation.</b>
<b>Well, I see how this
is gonna go down.</b>
<b>You are in risk of bodily
injury or destruction.</b>
<b>Jesus, you guys are nuts!</b>
<b>It's okay everybody.
I got this all under control.</b>
<b>- You accomplished a lot.
- Yes I did.</b>
<b>The adrenalin is affecting your
reasoning and decision making.</b>
<b>Track his calls.</b>
<b>- Who?
- Porter.</b>
<b>He's about to call her right now.
Can you track it?</b>
<b>- Affirmative.
- Go ahead.</b>
<b>You're not concerned about her
being aware of our interest?</b>
<b>No.</b>
<b>Safer this way we don't
want to sneak up on her.</b>
<b>He's making a call.
I've obtained the address.</b>
<b>Zone 12 is home to 7 major gangs,</b>
<b>innumerous subgroups
all fighting for control.</b>
<b>Is it wise we go it alone?</b>
<b>Don't worry. We going in the back way.
No sirens, no lights. No ones expecting us.</b>
<b>We'll be out before
they know we're there.</b>
<b>Sir, they're on the move.</b>
<b>Good. Good. Notify me
when they reach the target.</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>Yeah. Put out the word. The ones who
killed Dext will be in the Zone tonight.</b>
<b>Wait for my signal. Yeah.</b>
<b>- Still have a lock on the location?
- It's an unregistered Paygo phone.</b>
<b>No guarantee it's hers.</b>
<b>Maybe it's Porter's dry cleaner.</b>
<b>There are no registered
dry cleaners in this area.</b>
<b>They've entered the Zone.</b>
<b>Good. Soon as they make
contact I need to know.</b>
<b>- Are we still getting transmission?
- Yes, sir.</b>
<b>What about the manual override option?</b>
<b>You think you could switch
them into manual override?</b>
<b>Of course.
You want me to do it now?</b>
<b>No, no, no.
Just wait for my signal.</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>I hear that Helen Jacobs is more
than just a mere visitor to the Zone,</b>
<b>she is a vigilante.</b>
<b>The thing about the Zone is, you can
pretty much get anything you want.</b>
<b>It's outside the law,
but it's a price you have to pay.</b>
<b>Stay there too long and
you're affected by the radiation.</b>
<b>Criminals can come and go but the...
people, regular folks, get stuck there.</b>
<b>Knows the people she's fighting for.</b>
<b>Relax. Relax.</b>
<b>How's the operation going?</b>
<b>Like clockwork, sir.
The officers are nearly at their target.</b>
<b>Tell me again, about this.</b>
<b>Well, it's always been our goal
to rid this zone of gang lords.</b>
<b>Last week's raid was
step 1, this is step 2.</b>
<b>Once Officer Hammond and his
partner acquire their targets,</b>
<b>they'll be 14 miles into the zone.</b>
<b>Due to the contamination,
there's only one safe way out.</b>
<b>Fortunately for us, that safe way
leads them pass each gang territory</b>
<b>one by one, by one.</b>
<b>It'll be kill or be killed.</b>
<b>Now, the beauty of this, sir, is</b>
<b>they'll be taking the
gangs out for us, one by one.</b>
<b>And if they should be taken out,</b>
<b>then we'll be justified
in going in for retaliation.</b>
<b>It's a win-win, sir.</b>
<b>But what if they make it back?</b>
<b>There's no chance
of that happening, sir.</b>
<b>That woman...</b>
<b>that they're after,
that's not my daughter.</b>
<b>She is trying to destroy me.</b>
<b>Sir, no one is going
to let that happen.</b>
<b>We have a manual
override on the droid,</b>
<b>so if it comes to that,
he'll take 'em out.</b>
<b>But, why not we just let
them do our dirty work for us.</b>
<b>Clean up the zones.</b>
<b>The city needs more
men like you, Officer.</b>
<b>Thank you, sir.</b>
<b>Who are you guys?</b>
<b>You can just call us the
future of law enforcement.</b>
<b>Then I think the
city is in good hands.</b>
<b>- We are within 500 m of the signal.
- Okay.</b>
<b>We go on foot from here.</b>
<b><i>We're on official police business.
There is nothing to see here.</i></b>
<b><i>Return to your dwellings.</i></b>
<b>Why don't you just call
the rest of them out?</b>
<b>It is better we make our presence
known, than to surreptitiously advance.</b>
<b>We'll see about that.</b>
<b>Are we close to the signal?</b>
<b>Within 50 yards.</b>
<b>- Call it.
- I'm sorry.</b>
<b>- Call the phone.
- Calling.</b>
<b>Over there.</b>
<b>Great.</b>
<b>We need to get back to the vehicle.
Plan B.</b>
<b>What is Plan B?</b>
<b>Can you call HQ?</b>
<b>And now you're
considering calling for backup?</b>
<b>Look, just call it.</b>
<b>- Something's interfering.
- Great.</b>
<b>A throw-away cellphone works, but a
trillion dollar robot can't get through.</b>
<b>- I am not a robot.
- Figure of speech.</b>
<b>Sorry for calling you the R word.</b>
<b>It appears that I'm having
a block from the other side.</b>
<b>So why don't you just call 911?</b>
<b>Police services had been
discontinued in this zone.</b>
<b>It was a joke. You should've asked
the wizard for a sense of humour.</b>
<b>Look, let's just get to
the car and call for backup.</b>
<b>Who is the wizard?</b>
<b>Stop! Stop! Get down.</b>
<b>- Helen Jacobs.
- Yeah.</b>
<b>We're here to escort you in.</b>
<b>Thanks. But I think you're going
to be the ones needing an escort.</b>
<b>How did you know about the bomb?</b>
<b>I've been down here
long enough to know</b>
<b>that when someone
crawls under a parked car</b>
<b>they're not a
welcoming committee.</b>
<b>- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.</b>
<b>We were told you maybe
coerced into a sex ring.</b>
<b>That's tactful.</b>
<b>Yeah, and if I was,</b>
<b>it probably would be more
of a public relations issue</b>
<b>than any concern to
my personal welfare.</b>
<b>It was mentioned.</b>
<b>Damn it Andy,
would you back off.</b>
<b>Listen, you need to come with us.</b>
<b>- Am I under arrest?
- Well, no.</b>
<b>Have you committed any crime
that may warrant an arrest?</b>
<b>Would you, would you shut..</b>
<b>Look, you need to
come with us right now.</b>
<b>No, you need to come with me.
Now.</b>
<b>That explosion is going to draw
everything out of the woodwork.</b>
<b>I can't be responsible for
what happens to you guys.</b>
<b>Is that the best video you got?</b>
<b>Yes, sir. That's the
best we can do right now.</b>
<b>- And we can't get audio?
- I'm working on it.</b>
<b>Halt! That's her.
I'll take that as a positive ID.</b>
<b>- Did we take out the vehicle?
- Negative, Sir. That wasn't us.</b>
<b>Oh, they're gonna have a fun night.</b>
<b>Hey, it's a go.
Put out the word.</b>
<b>Dext's killer would be in Zone 12,
Grid 16. Headed east on foot.</b>
<b>Now you do whatever
you want with the girl.</b>
<b>But you make sure
neither of them get out alive.</b>
<b>Okay. Okay, look.
Nothing to see here.</b>
<b>That's not what I see.</b>
<b>Look, you're not our concern.
Kindly step aside.</b>
<b>Oh, we will. As soon as
we're finished with you.</b>
<b>I'm going to pretend
I didn't even hear that.</b>
<b>Cause, I'm trying to
be a nice guy, okay.</b>
<b>Now there are a couple of
ways this is gonna go down,</b>
<b>and none of them
turn out so good for you.</b>
<b><i>You're interfering with police business.</i></b>
<b><i>Stand aside, or you
will be subject to force.</i></b>
<b>Andy. Andy. I got this.</b>
<b>Look. We're not after you but we can
be if you wanted to go down like that.</b>
<b>I could charge you all
with obstructing justice.</b>
<b>Stand down or you
will be subject to force.</b>
<b>Stop!</b>
<b>You have a hammer.
I have a hammer too.</b>
<b>Mine is better.</b>
<b>Oh yeah, oh yeah. You are one
hell of a negotiator, aren't you?</b>
<b>That was a lethal weapon.</b>
<b>That was an axe. This is LA.</b>
<b>If I shot everybody that came at me with an
axe, I'd never get through the paperwork.</b>
<b>Besides, the plan was to
go in and out, under the radar,</b>
<b>and not ring the damn dinner bell.</b>
<b>Your negotiations would have
been with the same results.</b>
<b>Oh, you're so damn
confident aren't you?</b>
<b>Confidence is outside of my parameters.</b>
<b>So this is outside your parameter.</b>
<b>And you. You're trying to
kill all of us. You included.</b>
<b>If this isn't your territory,
why are you here?</b>
<b>Okay. Come on.</b>
<b>- Woh.
- That's okay. They're with me.</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Ready?</b>
<b>That's okay, just... show them,
show them your baby.</b>
<b>My scan show that the
child is completely normal.</b>
<b>Yeah, we can see that,
but what does it mean?</b>
<b>If this environment were radioactive,</b>
<b>you wouldn't be able to
have babies without mutations.</b>
<b>You are correct.</b>
<b>Mutations resulting from
radioactive fallout occur prior to birth.</b>
<b>So you're saying...</b>
<b>People are not getting
sick because of radiation.</b>
<b>It's something else. It's something
introduced into the environment.</b>
<b>Why, like poison?
Why would anyone want to do that?</b>
<b>Land value.</b>
<b>Look at Los Angeles. We have, what, 30
million people, and no room to house them.</b>
<b>If someone reviewed the Zone,
it would have more than enough room.</b>
<b>So, keeping this area
off limits to development</b>
<b>increases the value of
whatever available land there is.</b>
<b>So who would benefit from that?</b>
<b>Whoever who owns their land.</b>
<b>And with the quarantine, I guess,</b>
<b>nobody could come in
here and see what's going on.</b>
<b>You need to leave.</b>
<b>All right buddy, I'm
right here with you.</b>
<b>This place is a sanctuary. You can't
stay here. They can't get caught here.</b>
<b>Pick on me. Psst.</b>
<b>The major shareholder of the properties
would benefit most from a scheme like this.</b>
<b>Yeah, I know. My father.</b>
<b>We have to go.</b>
<b>Why would you help us?</b>
<b>I know you don't remember me, but...</b>
<b>I think you saved my life.
At the boundary.</b>
<b>At Deorogan, you don't remember it?</b>
<b>You have to leave now.</b>
<b>Give me a minute.</b>
<b>Why would they want us to get her out?</b>
<b>Maybe they're afraid of
what she might discover.</b>
<b>Couldn't they just disconnect her?</b>
<b>Cos her body back home
know what she knows here?</b>
<b>You know that.
They're connected.</b>
<b>That Helen is the same as this body.</b>
<b>We need to get her
into protective custody.</b>
<b>I'll call Mills. He's solid.
We'll get backup.</b>
<b>Just the two of us. I don't
think we'll make it out alive.</b>
<b>Alive!</b>
<b>Well, in your case, functional.</b>
<b>We need to call for an extraction.</b>
<b>We have to get on top of high ground,
preferably a building would be ideal</b>
<b>then he could contact the
cell towers to line of sight.</b>
<b>Do you know any place like that?</b>
<b>I have an idea.</b>
<b>You're a long way from home.</b>
<b>You kill Dext, and we all forget.</b>
<b>Sergeant! The iron sky is
picking up gunfire in Zone 12.</b>
<b>Oh. Oh. Well it's about time.
Let's move out.</b>
<b>- Williams.
- Yes, Sir.</b>
<b>I want you to notify me of any
changes of their status or position.</b>
<b>Yes, Sir.</b>
<b>And I want officers at that medport standing
by in case we need to go to Plan B.</b>
<b>Already in route, Sir.</b>
<b>Excellent. Well you sit back
and enjoy the show, son.</b>
<b>Copy that.</b>
<b>That was the weak gang?</b>
<b>There. Pueblo Mueta.</b>
<b>Pueblo Mueta.
Has a nice ring to it.</b>
<b>One thing's for sure.
They heard us coming.</b>
<b>- Are you sure we need to go up there?
- Affirmative.</b>
<b>You two may stay here.
I will go alone.</b>
<b>Well, I don't get to go to Pueblo Mueta.
What would I tell my kids?</b>
<b>- You have kids?
- Well, not yet.</b>
<b>Okay. Let's... let's do it.</b>
<b>Go. Go. Move.</b>
<b>Go. Go. Go.</b>
<b>- Williams. Come in.
- This is Williams. Go ahead.</b>
<b>I need a status update.</b>
<b>We got more ground fire.
Looks like the PM tower.</b>
<b>Sir, what do we do if they contact us?</b>
<b>You tell them to sit tight.
Calvary's coming.</b>
<b>Yeah. Sit tight.</b>
<b>Well hello, Pueblo Mueta.
We need to find a staircase.</b>
<b>Accessing blueprints.</b>
<b>This way.</b>
<b>Oooh!</b>
<b>You know what?
We have to go through.</b>
<b>Ooooh!</b>
<b>I guess not everybody exist on rats.</b>
<b>Uh, cannibals?</b>
<b>Dang, cannibals.</b>
<b>Bring me their guts.</b>
<b>You can get through us.</b>
<b>Hey policeman.
Where are you going?</b>
<b>Andy, come on.</b>
<b>Andy, what are you doing?</b>
<b>Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.</b>
<b>- I'll handle this. Keep moving.
- What?</b>
<b>Hammond.</b>
<b>Hammond!</b>
<b>Hey, you!</b>
<b>Come on.</b>
<b>Let's go.</b>
<b>- Can you connect to the cell tower?
- Working on it.</b>
<b>Connecting.</b>
<b>This is Officer One of Special Unit,
requesting extraction.</b>
<b>Sending coordinates now.</b>
<b>Officer One.</b>
<b>We're discharge to the nearest
secured unit to your location.</b>
<b>Please standby for estimated arrival.</b>
<b>The Commander will
be here in 5 minutes.</b>
<b>I'm like him.</b>
<b>Williams.
Stand by for my command.</b>
<b>If we need to go into manual
override, I want to know my signal.</b>
<b>Copy that.
I'll wait for your signal.</b>
<b>I mean like, not like him.
Like...</b>
<b>Yeah I, I suspected... I mean
...the fragments, the memories.</b>
<b>Have you seen it? Me.
The body have. Have you seen it?</b>
<b>Oh yes, we've seen you.</b>
<b>That. That's not me.
This is me.</b>
<b>Yeah, we know. And we won't
let anything happen to you.</b>
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Yeah. That's one of ours.</b>
<b>Hammond.</b>
<b>Jones.</b>
<b>Out on a mission?</b>
<b>A lot of guys for
just a simple extraction.</b>
<b>Ay, we were out on an exercise.</b>
<b><i>Helen, Hammond back away.</i></b>
<b><i>Your micro-expression reveal
a hidden agenda, Sergeant.</i></b>
<b>My micro-expressions.</b>
<b>Hot damn, you think that is
pretty friggin' awesome, aren't you?</b>
<b>Well I always get a kick out of
spending some time with your kind.</b>
<b>Now was that a lie or not?</b>
<b><i>Hammond, take the girl and go.</i></b>
<b>Hammond, partner's gone batty. We
might have to take him in for a overhaul.</b>
<b>Hey, you gonna end up
on the scrap heap for that.</b>
<b>You won't shoot me. You were
designed to protect and serve.</b>
<b><i>But you said, I may be malfunctioning.</i></b>
<b>Williams, we need
that manual override.</b>
<b>Initiating manual override control.
In 3, 2, 1.</b>
<b>Hammond!</b>
<b>What .. what are you doing?</b>
<b>I don't know.
I'm not doing this.</b>
<b>Stop where you are
or I will shoot you.</b>
<b><i>Helen, someone has
overwritten his control.</i></b>
<b>What the hell are you talking about?</b>
<b><i>Helen. Shoot him.</i></b>
<b>What the hell is happening to me?
Drop your weapon.</b>
<b><i>You're one of us, man.
You're an android cop.</i></b>
<b>Shut up!</b>
<b>Williams, what's going on?</b>
<b>His protocols are
deeper than I thought.</b>
<b>But the droid
Hammond still ain't go.</b>
<b>Well, I don't care. You'd
better fix it. Fix it, man.</b>
<b><i>Shoot him in the temporal
lobe, on the side of the head.</i></b>
<b>I can't!</b>
<b>I am not an android!</b>
<b><i>You must do it. It is the only
way to remove their control.</i></b>
<b>An android we can
pass through your eye.</b>
<b>A little easier to defence, man
and I've got a camera, Sarge.</b>
<b>Right.</b>
<b>You know what you sound like
when you say you don't like machines.</b>
<b>You're dead!</b>
<b>The central nervous system is fine,
but the spine has been severed.</b>
<b>He is paralyzed from the waist down.</b>
<b>When will he wake up?</b>
<b>Well, I wouldn't call
it waking up exactly.</b>
<b>But if this works, he'll go right
back to work in his old position.</b>
<b>I can't do it.</b>
<b><i>Hammond! Eliminate her.</i></b>
<b>I'm unarmed.</b>
<b>You gonna shoot me?</b>
<b><i>This is a direct order.
That woman is a terrorist and</i></b>
<b><i>an enemy of the state.
I have Directive 109 to terminate her.</i></b>
<b>Hang on.
We gonna take you out of here.</b>
<b><i>This zone is off limits.</i></b>
<b>Go!</b>
<b>Run! I... Run now!</b>
<b>I said, leave now.</b>
<b>I'm gonna finish this.
Get your back. Come on.</b>
<b>Back to land.</b>
<b>You need proof that the
people here are being poisoned.</b>
<b>I've been taking blood samples
of people all over the zones.</b>
<b>Whatever is poisoning
them, it's in their blood.</b>
<b>I just don't know how they
are administering the poison.</b>
<b>- It's in the food.
- What?</b>
<b>It's in the food drops.</b>
<b>When I was at your house, I saw
a picture of your father, the Mayor,</b>
<b>receiving commendations
for the food drops.</b>
<b>Whatever is poisoning
all the people, is in the food.</b>
<b>We need to get the story out there.</b>
<b>I have a contact that
will get this story out.</b>
<b>Believe me, he is
no friend of your father's.</b>
<b><i>Take the floor!</i></b>
<b>Williams, come in.
We need to go to Stage 2.</b>
<b>Plan B is now in effect.</b>
<b><i>Are you sure?</i></b>
<b>No, you're right.
Maybe I should reconsider.</b>
<b>Yes, I'm sure.
Don't ever question me again!</b>
<b>Something's wrong.</b>
<b><i>Hello Hammond.</i></b>
<b><i>Right now, I imagine you feeling kind
a squeasy, well put us all in a start.</i></b>
<b>What have they done?</b>
<b><i>Your life support has
been disconnected.</i></b>
<b><i>I'm afraid it was some kind of accident,
at least that's the official report.</i></b>
<b><i>I don't know how long you have,</i></b>
<b><i>your body can't function
long without the machines.</i></b>
<b><i>It's ironic, isn't it.</i></b>
<b><i>But I'm ravelling, how long do
you have, maybe 20 minutes.</i></b>
<b>Bastard.</b>
<b><i>Maam, I'm sorry to say that you will
soon be experiencing the same thing,</i></b>
<b><i>and I'd like to say it was tough convincing
your father it was necessary, but</i></b>
<b><i>let's say the Mayor was pragmatic.
Now where were we?</i></b>
<b><i>Oh Hammond! Yes.</i></b>
<b><i>There is a solution.</i></b>
<b><i>Give up and we'll plug you and
your father and your friends back in.</i></b>
<b><i>Whatever you think you know,
whatever information you have,</i></b>
<b><i>is not going to make a difference.</i></b>
<b><i>And you're both going to die.</i></b>
<b><i>Tick tock.
We'll be waiting on you.</i></b>
<b>Andy. What is the
fastest way to Media Centre?</b>
<b>No, we have to go to your house,
where your body is being kept.</b>
<b><i>Helen Jacobs body is not at her house.</i></b>
<b>How do you know that?</b>
<b><i>They would have expected that.
They have moved the body.</i></b>
<b>Do you know where?</b>
<b><i>I may be able to link it
to the nurse's tracking device.</i></b>
<b><i>I logged on to it
when I was at the hospital.</i></b>
<b>Yeah, I know you have a thing for it.</b>
<b><i>I have the location.</i></b>
<b>Good. We can have the
media to meet us there.</b>
<b>What about you?</b>
<b>Forget about me.</b>
<b>I'm not going to let you die.</b>
<b><i>Calculating.</i></b>
<b>Look. You think those assholes are going
to let me or any of us live after this?</b>
<b>Even if they do, they're probably put
me back in a coma, or erase my memory.</b>
<b>No, we have to see this through.
It's the only way for any of us.</b>
<b><i>Turn here.</i></b>
<b>- Here.
- Affirmative.</b>
<b>There.</b>
<b>Shit.</b>
<b>Two hundred yards.</b>
<b>Hit them with everything.</b>
<b>Andy, they are doing something to her.
Give me... give her something.</b>
<b><i>I might be able to help
her human body. But not her.</i></b>
<b><i>There's nothing I can do.</i></b>
<b>Andy. Contact Arnie Miller. At the union.
Tell him to meet us at Metal Services.</b>
<b>Tell him to get every media hound
in town, to meet us there.</b>
<b><i>Copy that.</i></b>
<b>She is to scare us out.
They know we're ignoring.</b>
<b>Yeah. But they don't
know how we're getting in.</b>
<b>I told you it's nasty, officers.
But, sadly, this is where it ends.</b>
<b>By my calculations, you've got under
2 minutes of life, Officer Hammond.</b>
<b>Ms Jacobs, I'm not at liberty to
comment on your status but your father</b>
<b>has prepared a glowing press release</b>
<b>honoring your services to
the unfortunate in the zone.</b>
<b>Hammond, I never liked you,</b>
<b>but I hate to see
a fellow officer go down,</b>
<b>even one as misguided as you.</b>
<b>So give up now.
We can work this out.</b>
<b>You both don't have to die.</b>
<b>Last chance.</b>
<b>Hit them with everything!</b>
<b>Everything!</b>
<b>Go.</b>
<b>I have a story for you.</b>
<b>Officer.</b>
<b>I want to thank you
for saving my daughter.</b>
<b>And my deepest
condolences for your partner.</b>
<b>It is a shame though, as you
may not have been aware</b>
<b>of Helen's wishes.</b>
<b>Apparently and unbeknown to us,</b>
<b>she signed a
"Do Not Resuscitate" order.</b>
<b>We have been fighting the Courts
to keep her going, but to no avail.</b>
<b>We received the verdict today.</b>
<b>We lost.</b>
<b>Helen is going to get her wishes.</b>
<b>She would have never
wanted to exist like this.</b>
<b>We thought her android body
could give her another live.</b>
<b>But now that's over,
and thanks to you...</b>
<b>The Court order requires
that we pull the plug.</b>
<b>Turn the machine off. Now.</b>
<b>You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?</b>
<b>Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.</b>
<b>I don't know what's happening, Sir.</b>
<b>That's why...
Why did you do it, right?</b>
<b>Did you poison them?</b>
<b>Do something!</b>
<b><i>You told me she wouldn't wake up.
What did you do to her?</i></b>
<b><i>Your nurse has been
keeping her sedated.</i></b>
<b><i>I don't know what's happening, sir.</i></b>
<b><i>Do something.</i></b>
<b>Officer, go get 3 men. Get back
here on the double. Go, go, go.</b>
<b>Shut that off.</b>
<b><i>Shut that off.</i></b>
<b>Shut if off.</b>
<b><i>Shut it off.</i></b>
<b>What is this?</b>
<b>Nobody move. Nobody moves.
Nobody.</b>
<b>Mr Mayor, hand me the weapon.</b>
<b>No, no, no, no. Don't!</b>
<b>Now that your BIOS has been
upgraded, Officer Hammond,</b>
<b>I believe our partnership can
operate on more equal terms.</b>
<b>What do you mean, equal terms?</b>
<b>You are now free to
operate in machine mode,</b>
<b>without human interference,
or logic deficits.</b>
<b>Human interference.</b>
<b>Human interference?</b>
<b>Is that what you just said?
I can't believe you even said that.</b>
<b>Something is amiss
with your programming.</b>
<b>No, something is amiss
with your programming.</b>
<b>Do you really think
we're the same, huh?</b>
<b>Let me explain it to you.</b>
<b>My CPU's neural network was imprinted by my
controller's, a human's neural framework.</b>
<b>That framework constitutes
70.236 of who I am.</b>
<b>And as you know, if you're one-eighth
of a human then you are what?</b>
<b>In fact, a human.</b>
<b>What I am is a Humadroidican
American. Get it straight.</b>
<b>I am sorry that your function will
be hampered by that framework.</b>
<b>Hampered? See see. No.
You're the one that is hampered.</b>
<b>Look at you. See you're
basically a soda machine.</b>
<b>No, no. Strike that.</b>
<b>A soda machine is better
because it dispenses soda.</b>
<b>Something useful.</b>
<b>But you, what do you dispense?
Hot air. Logic.</b>
<b>You can't even think on your feet,
you have no sense of humour,</b>
<b>you're just...</b>
<b>We're getting a call.</b>
<b>Already got that. See.</b>
<b>Uh, responding.</b>
<b>Hammond, I need you to...</b>
<b>Don't even have to say anything.
Thank you.</b>
