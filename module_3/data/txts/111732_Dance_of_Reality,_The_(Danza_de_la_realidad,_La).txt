Money is like blood,
it gives life if it flows.
Money is like Christ,
it blesses you if you share it.
Money is like Buddha,
if you don't work,
you don't get it.
<i>Money enlightens those who use it</i>
<i>to open the flower of the world,</i>
<i>and damns those who glorify it,</i>
<i>confounding riches with the soul.</i>
<i>There is no difference</i>
<i>between money and conscience.</i>
<i>There is no difference
between conscience and death.</i>
<i>There is no difference
between death and wealth.</i>
Why the hell are you so shy?
<i>Feeling the child
trapped within your breast,</i>
<i>the eyes full of an eternal absence.</i>
<i>Always outsiders, eternal outsiders.</i>
Come when you're told!
Hello Jaime!
It's been ages!
Everything alright in the shop?
The Gran Casa Ukrania!
Do you miss us?
I bet you do!
Are you still just as strong?
What do you think?
Does your son know
you used to climb ropes here?
Can you still do it?
Of course I can!
Let us see, as the blind say.
- Let us go!
- Shut up, you old fatso!
<i>Reality, the dance of reality!</i>
Let us see what you can do!
UP you go!
I can do it!
You still have your lovely muscles!
But your mighty fists, I doubt it!
Remember you challenged
the audience to box you?
Of course I do!
They got cash
if they beat him.
Yes, but with two blows
he would lay them flat on the floor.
Now that you sell knickers,
can you still do it?
Of course I can.
Let us put on the gloves.
Gloves?
Bare fists, like men!
Don%,Papa.
They'll kill you.
Shut up, you coward!
They'll say my son is a queer.
Watch out!
We're going to eat you!
Oh, horror!
Jaime hit me!
I'm going to faint.
Carrot!
- I'm scared!
- Scared?
- Don't ever say that!
- He's scared!
<i>Tocopilla, this tremor,</i>
<i>this scent of stones,</i>
<i>this lament of a small town</i>
<i>torn to shreds by the sun,</i>
<i>those patient streets</i>
<i>longing for a drop of water.</i>
Casa Ukrania!
Welcome to Casa Ukrania!
Come on in!
Alejandrito!
Why are you running,
my dear father?
I'm not your father!
I'm your son!
Alejandrito!
Get mad!
Get mad!
I am not a faggot!
You don't scare me!
Get as big as you want!
That's enough, silly child!
- Let me go, you old drunk!
- Enough!
A single stone can kill
all the fish in the sea.
So say I, the Queen of Cups.
Let me go!
Run!
You murdering child!
By torturing the sea
you killed them all!
No!
Get lost, you old hag!
<i>I felt confused:</i>
<i>should I suffer the anguish
of the sardines</i>
<i>or should I delight
in the joy of the gulls.</i>
<i>The balance tipped
in favour of anguish</i>
<i>when I saw the seagulls
deprived of their banquet.</i>
<i>In that world,
in which I felt a stranger,</i>
<i>all things were connected</i>
<i>in a web of suffering
and pleasure.</i>
Ice cream!
Cinnamon and vanilla!
<i>The collapse of Wall Street</i>
<i>has impoverished 70%
of the Chileans.</i>
<i>Our president,
Colonel Carlos Ibáñez del Campo</i>
<i>declares that the Public Treasury</i>
<i>has never been on a better footing.</i>
<i>Soon there will be employment for all.</i>
You lying jumped-up private!
If you allow me, young man,
I'll just scratch my back.
Would you like me to do it for you?
Well, if I don't disgust you.
Finish my ice cream,
if I don't disgust you either!
Come on!
It would be a pleasure.
Am I hurting you?
Since I lost my hands in the mine
and the Yanks kicked me out,
no one has touched me.
Poor man.
You dirty cripple,
come back,
and you'll go to jail!
I offered to scratch his back.
- He can't do it!
- Shut up!
Don't let this filth come near you!
They're full of lice!
Why dress up like Stalin?
You say you're a communist
but you only respect the rich.
If I had money,
you'd kiss my stumps!
You fucking Jew!
Son of a bitch!
Fuck off!
If you come back,
I'll cut your legs off!
- Motherfucker!
- Jaime, let him go!
Why hug that cripple?
You like men, do you?
With that girlish mane,
what else could we expect?
With that hair,
he looks like a faggot!
Show him some respect,
Alejandro is holy.
Holy, my bollocks!
Tell him why you call him your father
and not your son.
Tell him now!
In Russia,
my mother fell in love
with my father,
a handsome Russian dancer.
They were on the run
from the Jew-hating Cossacks.
They emigrated to Argentina
where they worked hard to cultivate
a small piece of land.
To light a lamp,
my father
climbed on to a cask
of alcohol.
The lid broke under his weight.
He was burned alive.
When I got pregnant,
I knew you would be
my father reincarnated.
And so it was,
you were born
with the same thick blond hair.
This comb
is the only thing
that remains of my father.
Enough!
Fairy tales!
Your son is your son!
You'll drive him crazy
with this nonsense!
Don't take him away!
He's mine!
Just try it!
Apologise!
Sorry.
Casa Ukrania!
Down with high prices!
There you are, fucking Jew!
I told you not to come back!
Please don't, Papa!
Let go!
That's the Jew who hit me!
C'mon you jerk! Asshole!
<i>Cockroach! Cooking cockroach!</i>
The tomb and the tombstone!
Entombed in the tomb!
The dynamite! Fucking fat bitch!
<i>Blows us apart!
Gives us but nothing!</i>
<i>Cockroach! Cooking cockroach!</i>
<i>The tomb and the tombstone!
Entombed in the tomb!</i>
<i>The dynamite! Fucking fat bitch!</i>
<i>Blows us apart!
Gives us but nothing!</i>
<i>They cut off our legs,</i>
<i>They cut off our arms!</i>
<i>Dynamite has no heart,</i>
<i>It strokes us apart.</i>
<i>Dynamite has no heart,</i>
<i>It strokes us apart.</i>
Fucking jerk!
Son of a bitch!
How can you be such a coward?
Keep still!
My mother will be angry!
You look like a whore,
not like a man.
Calm down
or I'll tear your hair out!
Go ahead.
- What's the matter, midget?
- It really hurts.
Don't suffer for what isn't yours.
It's your grandfather's hair.
Enough of this delusion!
Let's go!
Now you'll learn
how to be a man!
Here is your son!
Your golden curls?
Who are you?
I don't know you.
Traitor!
Don't ever touch me again.
I'm telling you to go.
You and Jaime...
have murdered my father.
You've left me...
an orphan.
She'll come out
for the customers.
Death to high prices!
Take that! And that!
Stay still.
A man controls himself!
I'm going to tickle you.
If you don't laugh,
you deserve to be my son.
Don't laugh!
Good.
The armpits!
Don't give in!
Now the neck!
Resist!
The nose!
Alright.
You're starting to
deserve my admiration.
Don't look so happy,
I only said "starting to".
If you want me to be proud of you,
you must show me
you can deal with pain.
I'm going to slap you.
If you ask me to,
I'll slap you harder.
And the more you ask,
the harder I'll slap.
We'll see how much
you can cope with.
Let's begin.
Harder.
Harder.
Harder.
Harder.
Harder.
Harder.
You broke my tooth,
but if you love me,
it doesn't matter.
Of course it matters.
To the dentist!
Get on, you lazy bastard!
To the rubbish dump!
<i>Dynamite has no heart,</i>
<i>It strokes us apart.</i>
Open wide, my boy.
The air on the saliva
must hurt a lot.
A man must be brave.
If you do as I ask
then you will win my admiration.
Let him treat you
without anaesthetic.
Look.
Willpower overcomes pain.
Let's see if you are like me.
Open wide.
It's just a little painkiller.
No injection, Don Julio.
But it will really hurt.
I'll send you two bottles of wine.
What does the boy have to say?
I don't need an injection, sir.
Well, if you say so.
Open your mouth wide.
That's my boy!
That's it, son. All done.
You're a real hero!
<i>You did it...</i>
without a whimper!
Without trembling!
Without a tear!
You are a Jodorowsky!
Come here!
Now what?
Don't be such a girl!
You're my son!
Stand up, damn it!
I tripped, Papa, I'm fine.
That's my boy.
Willpower overcomes all.
See you, Don Julio. Thank you.
I'll send you the bottles.
- Make it French wine, Don Jaime.
- Of course.
<i>Ice cream!</i>
<i>Water, air,
earth and fire flavours!</i>
You made a great effort, my son.
Yes, Papa.
You need to breathe some sea air.
You'll feel better.
Yes, Papa.
I have to get back
to the shop.
Stay here and look at the sea.
Hey, boy!
Are you brave?
Yes, I am!
Then wait there.
Are you scared?
No, Theosophist.
- Why not?
- I'm a man, Theosophist.
- You know my name?
- Yes.
- Who told it to you?
- My papa.
Your papa!
Look, I'll show you how to meditate.
Say after me:
Gate.
Gate.
Paragate.
Parasamgate.
Bodhi Svaha.
Gate, in the intellect.
Gate, in the heart.
Gate, in the sex.
Paragate, even deeper.
Parasamgate, heart.
Bodhi Svaha, happiness!
Bodhi Svaha, happiness!
Bodhi Svaha, happiness,
happiness, happiness, happiness,
happiness, happiness!
Come with me.
Do you know how long
these cable cars have been here?
I don't know, Theosophist.
Thousands and thousands
and thousands of years.
You don't know where they come from
nor where they go,
but you can take
one of their rocks
and keep it like a treasure.
Come.
Those oars are like our bodies
which carry our souls.
The soul is a treasure,
the god within us.
I'm going to give you a present.
See these three medals?
They think they're separate.
Melt them down in an oven,
and they will turn
into a single drop.
Here, have them.
Make a necklace with them
and wear it all the time
to remind you
that a single god unites
the three of them.
Thank you, Theosophist.
I love this perfume.
Put that drink down.
I feel like it.
I don't feel like it.
Well, I do!
Who commands here?
You.
Come!
You are mine!
Look what I've got.
Calm down, boy.
- Look!
- What is it?
Medals!
- Who gave them to you?
- The Theosophist.
I told you not to see him!
Show me this rubbish.
Crazy idiot!
Numbing his fear of death
with idle dreams!
On your knees!
God does not exist!
God does not exist!
God does not exist!
You die and you rot!
There's nothing beyond!
Your father never lies!
Who do you believe,
me or that idiot?
<i>Who was I going to choose?</i>
I believe you, Papa.
The beggar is crazy!
God does not exist.
You die and you rot.
There's nothing beyond.
Bravo! Up you get.
A warrior overcomes his delusions.
Now go to bed!
<i>Every Wednesday,</i>
<i>late at night,</i>
<i>I awoke and looked on anxiously</i>
<i>as my father left the house.</i>
<i>Where was he going?</i>
Do you fancy some?
Blowjob, Jaime?
Think of the life eternal.
Lotto! Win a chick!
Come, Rosita.
This is our Tocopilla.
We have to do something for it.
I have an important secret meeting.
Another time, alright?
Jaime, you know I like you
and I've never charged you.
Greetings, comrades!
Greetings, comrade!
Bad news, comrades.
We're in danger.
Ibáñez is heading
for a fascist dictatorship.
Slaughtering workers
and students wasn't enough.
Nor speculating
with Yankee bankers.
Now, he wants to intern
all the communists.
Listen, comrades!
My friend Ambrosia
has sent me a letter.
A letter?
"Dear Toña,
I have something dreadful to tell you.
"On Ibáñez's orders, the police
"are drowning the homosexuals.
"My lover, a queer cop
who pretends I'm a woman,
"tied ten of them to a heavy chain,
"put them on a plane
and threw them in the sea.
"You and our sisters
live under threat.
"Take care.
Love, Ambrosia."
First the communists,
then the homosexuals,
then the students,
the sailors on strike, the miners...
How long are we going to stand this?
Yes, how long?
We could organise a general strike
by means of leaflets, letters
and secret meetings.
How would we fund all that?
We don't even have enough
to buy a drink.
- Comrade Toña?
- Yes, Jaime.
Bring us some beers.
Bravo, Comrade Jodorowsky!
Don't you Jodorowsky me!
Comrades, you know full well
my real name is the one
on my communist card:
Juan Araucano.
Sorry, Comrade Juan.
From now on,
we must live as eunuchs,
destroy compromising documents
and keep our mouths shut
until we see better days.
No sooner said than done!
So be it.
- Stop that fuss!
- Shut up, you bitch!
- You're a bigger bitch than I am!
- Come on! Stop that!
We've got to do something, girls!
We can't go on like this.
Comrades!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Workers of the world...
Unite!
<i>Arise ye workers from your slumbers</i>
<i>Arise ye prisoners of want</i>
Cheers, comrades!
Cheers!
Long live the Communist Party!
The Casa Ukrania
offers you a red nose
and 10% off all purchases...
Shut up!
Take off that nose!
- I've got a surprise for you.
- What, Papa?
You'll see.
Attention!
At ease!
Comrade Kazan,
we will never forget you.
We will never forget you!
Our mascot has passed away
just three days before
our annual parade,
but we have found someone
to replace him.
I am proud to inform you
that everyone agrees.
You are the new mascot
of Tocopilla's Fire Brigade!
I don't want to be a mascot.
I'm not a dog.
It is an honour, little comrade.
The other children will envy you.
- They'll laugh at me!
- Out of envy!
Shut up!
Here, put it on.
You'll look a hero.
I will if you give me
the black man's shoes.
What black man?
What shoes?
The red shoes of the dummy
in the window.
That automaton was very expensive.
It has to be elegant.
What will people say
if it's barefoot?
Put him in my shoes.
- They're ugly!
- You bought them!
I don't buy ugly things.
Well then?
Alright then.
You've persuaded me.
You can have them.
Thank you.
Carlitos!
Look, I've got new shoes!
They're the most beautiful shoes
I've ever seen.
That's right.
Why are you crying?
I'll never have shoes like those.
Here, have them.
- For me?
- Yes.
Carlitos!
- What's this?
- Carlitos' box.
Where are your shoes?
I gave them to him.
Are you mad or what?
I felt sorry for him.
He's poor!
Go and get them back.
I can't.
He went to the beach.
That brat will be back
to fetch his box.
Go to the square,
wait for him
and get them,
even if you have to punch him!
Yes, Papa.
What happened to the boy,
professor?
He went to play on the rocks.
The rubber soles made him slip.
He fell into the sea.
And the silly boy drowned.
<i>And so our school friend
became a seaside icon,</i>
<i>imprisoned forever
in that sanctuary,</i>
<i>devoted to the granting
of miracles.</i>
Go on!
<i>Suffering, relief,</i>
<i>relief, suffering...</i>
<i>the chain is never-ending.</i>
You can play for an hour!
Hey, Pinocchio!
- Do you want to come with us?
- Where?
Among the rocks.
- We're going to beat the bishop.
- Beat the what?
Come and find out.
Come on, Pinocchio, beat off!
You'll enjoy it!
His prick is different!
We've got a banana,
he's got a mushroom.
He has no foreskin,
his end is blunt.
Your difference bothers us!
Go away!
Ugly Jew!
<i>Stop!</i>
<i>Don't jump!</i>
<i>You are not alone.
You are with me.</i>
<i>All you are going to be,
you are already.</i>
<i>What you are looking for
is already within you.</i>
<i>Embrace your sufferings,</i>
<i>for through them
you will reach me.</i>
<i>And who shall I be
in twenty years?</i>
<i>In a hundred?
In tens of thousands?</i>
<i>Will my consciousness
still need a body?</i>
<i>For you,
I do not yet exist.</i>
<i>For me,
>you do not exist anymore.</i>
<i>At the end of time,</i>
<i>when all matter returns
to its origin,</i>
<i>you and I
will have just been memories,</i>
<i>nothing real.</i>
<i>Something is dreaming us.</i>
<i>Embrace the illusion.</i>
<i>Live!</i>
Casa Ukrania!
We swallow high prices!
Jaime!
Alejandrito!
Get down, you fool!
I'm a fireman!
I'm here to put out the fire.
- Pedraza, stop the engine!
- I can't!
The slums are burning.
We must hurry
or they'll be dead!
Damn it!
Hold tight, you idiot!
Take this whistle.
These dossers are thieves.
As soon as they get too close,
blow your whistle
and I'll kick them up the ass.
Got it?
Attention!
Got it, Papa.
Clear off!
Son of a bitch!
Fuck off!
Here. I didn't let them steal it.
You're looking for compliments?
You only did your duty.
Halt!
Captain Pedraza is missing!
He's still over there!
Here he is!
Look.
Look!
Halt!
God does not exist.
You die and you rot.
There's nothing beyond!
I'm dead, Papa!
Calm down, you louse!
Don't embarrass me.
You're the mascot!
It's nothing.
He'll be fine.
He woke up
with a temperature.
I'll take him home
and come back.
Carry on!
You didn't wake me up!
It's late.
I've missed school.
You fainted at the funeral.
The doctor said to let you rest.
You slept solidly for two days.
Do you feel better now?
Yes, Papa, I feel really well.
Well, I feel really bad.
You acted like a coward.
Now they're laughing at me.
If the son is a coward,
the father must be too.
Even dressed up as a fireman,
a Jew is a Jew.
- I'm very sorry, Papa.
- Shut up!
Look!
Mr Mayor, they're coming!
- How many?
- 300.
What?
Hurry, Cuevas,
give the alarm!
Now stay here!
If you dare move an inch,
we'll shoot you!
You pose a threat
to all of Tocopilla.
You're carrying the plague!
What about water?
Where's the water?
Ask God for it!
Water, damn it!
Water!
We want water!
Water!
Silence!
If you don't keep quiet,
you'll all be shot!
All of you!
Wait, Jaime!
It's crazy! Don't go!
Silence, woman!
I will show those fucking firemen
I'm braver than them.
Water!
Water!
Calm down,
there's enough for everyone!
My donkeys!
No!
No!
You're eating my donkeys!
How will I bring the water
tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
We're hungry today!
Jaime!
Papa!
They're going to burn me!
Never!
They will never burn you!
That's enough,
don't shut yourself in!
If you don't surrender,
you will all die.
Your shop will be
a source of infection!
My dear son,
you mustn't get infected.
Go and wash your hands
and lock yourself
in the bathroom.
Yes, Mama!
God,
I feel You inside of me.
I am a part of You.
I am nothing,
I know nothing,
I can do nothing.
You are everything,
You know everything,
You can do everything!
I am the bank
of the vast river
that You are.
Break through me
and let the waters
of Your healing flood
wash over him.
Jaime.
It's a miracle!
No, no!
I couldn't save the people.
I have no roots.
This is not my country.
I failed.
You cannot fail.
You are as strong as Stalin.
No!
Yes, you are.
Even stronger.
You are as strong as God.
God does not exist!
Yes He does.
He cured you.
Feel His presence
in your heart.
In my heart,
there is only you.
Sara,
Sara, Sara,
my Sara,
my devoted Sara,
my long-suffering Sara,
forgive me.
You have restored my strength.
Now I know
how to save all the poor!
Chile cannot put up
with a tyrant's lies forever.
I'll go to Santiago
and put a bullet
through his head!
Enough now!
We won't wait any longer!
Come out right away,
or we'll burn your shop!
They're surrendering.
We are alive, comrades.
- Death to Ibáñez!
- Death!
Here it is, comrades!
Hallelujah, I found it!
- No, I did!
- Shut up, comrade!
Shut up, comrade!
I won't shut up!
Individualist!
I'll shut up.
Go to sleep,
my little sweetheart.
Sara!
Look!
I found his weak spot.
He loves his horse
more than anything else.
No bloody soldier
will search me here.
Jaime, you're mad!
If I fail,
we may never see
one another again.
As long as I live,
I will love you.
As long as I live,
I will love you.
But this love so lonely
in my breast
will find sanctuary
and be a secret
of my own.
And be a secret
of my own.
As long as I live,
I will love you.
Mama!
Forgive me!
<i>Arise ye workers from your slumbers</i>
You want to kill Ibáñez.
Are you the secret police?
- Are you arresting me?
- It's not that.
I won't let you kill him
because I have to do it!
For three reasons:
One, you are a Jew
and a Chilean must kill him.
Two,
you are old and I am young.
Three, he who kills him
will go down in history.
And that has to be me!
Let go!
You idiot!
- Where did you get this gun?
- It was my father's,
a journalist who criticised Ibáñez.
They arrested and killed him.
Now I understand.
You don't want to go down in history,
you want to avenge your father.
I'll give my life
to get rid of him.
Alright.
Look,
you rid the world of him
and I'll help you.
Alright, comrade.
Ladies and gentlemen,
owners of these beloved dogs,
the time has come
to award our two prizes.
First prize,
the Golden Bone,
goes to the butterfly-dog.
This way, please.
And the Lead Bone,
for the worst costume,
<i>goes...</i>
to the kangaroo-dog.
Silence! Music!
The national anthem!
Don't shoot!
He doesn't deserve
such a death!
Death is death!
I don't want to live in a world
of dressed up dogs.
It makes me sick.
Heretics!
You destroyed my Christ!
Halt!
Don't shoot this man!
Take this poor man
to the communal grave,
together with his kangaroo-dog.
The show must go on!
To save the President,
this man risked his life!
If the gun had fired,
you would be dead now.
You deserve a reward.
I'm not asking for money, sir,
just a favour.
As I love horses,
my dream would be
to become your groom.
Your request is timely.
Don Aquiles,
my old groom,
wants to retire.
I'll send you to my estate
so he can train you.
In a month or two,
I'll see how you're getting on.
Aquiles, at your service, sir.
No need to be so respectful,
Don Aquiles.
I am merely your pupil.
Come along with me.
The only buildings on the land
are these right royal stables,
made just for Bucephalus,
my king.
I'll introduce you
to my handsome.
But be right careful,
he don't trust nobody.
You'll be sleeping here,
right next to me.
For we'll be up
at the crack of dawn every day
to see to Bucephalus'
health and comfort.
Walk!
Talk to him now.
Your voice must go right in his ear
to reach his heart.
- Bucephalus.
- That voice is from your head!
C'mon, man!
Try to understand that.
It's got to be from your chest.
Right from the heart.
Bucephalus...
you have everything.
I grew up on the streets,
treated with contempt,
amongst cruel people,
howling like a dog
for a bit of affection.
They shut me up in a fortress.
And there I remain,
hungry for affection.
No one has given me
what you give me now.
Well done, Jaime!
You'll win over Bucephalus yet!
Really well done!
Now you can take him
for a walk.
Yes, sir?
I'm at your service, Don Carlos.
Bucephalus is right well.
Yes, sir.
Yes, he'll be saddled up.
What is it?
The colonel can ask at any time
after his best friend.
He's coming tomorrow.
As for me,
the time has come to leave.
What?
Here is your grave,
Don Aquiles.
Take off your clothes
and put on mine.
Never take this hat off, friend.
That way Bucephalus
will never know I've gone.
For sure he'll love you
as much as me.
Rm giving up my soul,
it wants to return home.
It was just passing through here
with me.
Throw plenty of earth on me.
Make sure I'm well covered.
Tomorrow, don't say anything
to the President.
He won't even notice I left.
After all, the mighty
have too much on their minds
to remember an old bloke like me.
Thank you, Jaime, my friend.
Hello, Don Aquiles.
- How is Bucephalus?
- Very well, sir.
But I am not Aquiles.
The dog competition, sir...
Ah, yes!
How could I forget you?
It's fine!
Wait here.
Bucephalus,
my love.
You look so handsome,
my prince.
Let's have a look at you.
Good.
Good.
Splendid, splendid.
What a beauty!
Congratulations, Don Aquiles,
my horse has never
looked so well.
Here you are.
I don't want money, sir.
- It's a labour of love.
- I like your attitude.
I'll double your supplies!
Get up, Aquiles!
We're not in church.
I'm going to trot
then gallop for an hour.
When I come back,
I'll leave the animal with you.
You will give him water and food.
For my horse is sacred.
Dance!
Ah, Bucephalus!
His crimes are not the result
of a wicked soul,
but of an overwhelming generosity.
Enough!
Out of my head
treacherous thoughts!
He is not a good father,
he's a disgusting pig,
a bloodthirsty brute,
a cretinous egomaniac!
He's a damn soldier full of shit!
<i>Be careful with the yellow flowers!</i>
<i>These horses are wild about them.</i>
<i>But it's a deadly poison.</i>
You like them, don't you?
Eat.
Master, master!
What happened?
Answer, Aquiles!
What happened to him?
How can God allow this?
Such a noble beast!
Easy now, easy.
I'll just give you an injection
and you'll feel better.
That's my boy.
Damn God,
I'm going to shoot you!
You're going to feel better.
Bucephalus!
Please don't die!
Please don't die!
Don't die!
Thank you!
We're going to burn it down.
All of it!
You have always been
a most loyal servant.
This time, take the money.
Keep it all
and go away.
Nothing!
Nothing!
Mama!
What's the matter,
Alejandrito?
<i>Being in a cradle of cement,</i>
<i>swaddled in a gigantic shadow,</i>
<i>bound to my empty existence.</i>
<i>Trapped in this island of flesh,</i>
<i>searching for myself in memories,</i>
<i>and meeting no one.</i>
The darkness
is swallowing everything.
It's going to devour us.
Alejandrito,
do I love you?
Yes, Mama.
How much?
From the sky to the earth.
This is not my love,
it comes from God,
I am merely the sender.
As God creates all,
so we all radiate His love.
My son,
the darkness loves you
as much as I do,
for it is God's shadow.
I'm really scared.
It's going to vanish.
Black,
black, black.
Now you're just the same,
you belong to the darkness.
Darkness is your kingdom
and you are a monster
of the night.
You are hungry.
I am hungry!
To feed your hunger
you need to devour a princess,
ever so white.
Ever so white!
The princess hides.
The monster has to catch her.
Count up to ten!
One,
two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten!
Here I come!
Black.
Black.
Black.
<i>My mother dissolved
into the darkness.</i>
<i>And never again
was I scared of the night.</i>
Carlitos?
It can't be!
Are you a ghost?
You idiot,
I'm his twin Lucho!
- I loved him.
- Get off me!
You killed him.
Out of my sight!
Let me work!
Luchito!
Quiet!
Just look at what we have here!
Who deigns to visit us?
A rich boy stinking of soap!
This dark one
is our champion.
Let's see if Paleface
can defend himself!
Place your bets!
The rich or the poor?
The poor one!
Make a space!
Let the punches fly!
The first who cries loses.
- He's my friend!
- No, I'm not, you crappy Jew.
Get ready!
- One.
- One!
- Two.
- Two!
- Three.
- Three!
That doesn't count!
He came from behind!
Yes!
Quiet!
Come on, he's all yours!
Hit that traitor!
What have you done?
Nothing.
I was in La Urgencia.
They called me a Jew
and hit me.
If you want to survive
you must go unnoticed.
I'm going to remove
these barriers from your mind.
Out with Pinocchio!
Out with the Jew!
Out with the nose
and white skin!
You are empty!
You are invisible!
Are you sure I am invisible?
Come!
I will get undressed
and go inside.
No, Mama,
it's dangerous!
Have faith!
Alejandrito!
We are like air.
They do not see us, Alejandrito,
nor do they hear us.
Air...
We are air.
Did you teach my father
to be invisible?
He doesn't believe in such things.
Then Death can see him.
Maybe it has taken him away.
No, he's not dead.
If he was
my heart would tell me.
Where is he?
This stone
knows where Jaime is.
You are going to send him a message.
Spit.
Now tell him
what it is you want to say.
Don't forget us.
Come back.
Stop it! Go away!
Cuco, my pretty dog.
- What's the matter?
- Madam, my name isn't Cuco.
I am Jaime Jodorowsky!
What am I doing here?
So your memory has returned.
The dream is over.
What?
Get up!
I found you wandering the streets,
half starved.
Finally, cruel God sent someone
who wasn't repulsed by me.
I brought you to live with me.
Suspecting you would one day
be yourself again,
I wrote you a letter.
No one escapes
from their destiny.
I'll read it
so you understand.
"Meeting you
was like finding treasure.
"I was like a street dog,
"eating what I could find
in the rubbish.
"Nobody gave me a cent.
"I painted your arms
the colours of our flag,
"and your paralysed hands
"became a symbol
of the people's misery.
"In the day,
you were my sustenance,
"and at night, my glory.
"Even though
you couldn't caress me,
"in bed on your back,
"I would mount you.
"Knowing you would wake up
one day,
"I felt the joy of our union
"and the pain of knowing
it wouldn't last.
"Recovering your memory,
"you disappear from my life
"and therefore
my life disappears."
My love,
may cruel God heal
these hands of yours.
They have been the jewels
of my poor existence.
<i>Recovering your memory,</i>
<i>you disappear from my life</i>
<i>and therefore
my life disappears.</i>
Murderer!
I need help!
Sinner!
Damn priest!
I'm hungry!
Give me some!
Give me some!
I'm hungry!
"SACRED WOOD CARPENTERS"
Excuse me, sir...
There's no "sir" here.
If Christ the carpenter wasn't proud,
then why should I be?
Just call me José.
Excuse me, José...
Do you need something?
You look
as if you could do
with a coffin.
"If I forget you,
"O Jerusalem,
"let my right hand
forget its skill!"
Have you forgotten so much?
Why are you punishing yourself?
Saintly old man,
give me some work!
Help me sand these chairs
I have to deliver urgently.
Sand with your soul, my brother.
All God's paths
lead to the truth.
José, why are you so good to me?
"A broken and contrite heart,
"you will not despise."
Psalm 51.
Psalm 51.
But don't you despise me?
No!
<i>On the high sea!
On the high sea!</i>
<i>There was a sailor sailing</i>
<i>He loved to play guitar</i>
<i>And when he remembered
his dear country</i>
<i>He'd take his guitar
and he'd start to sing</i>
<i>On the high sea!
On the high sea!</i>
We've got the hundred chairs!
The work is done.
This is all I have.
- Will it be enough?
- Of course!
I'll take a train
to Valparaiso
then a boat to Tocopilla.
Thank you!
Welcome to the House of God!
Wonderful, you brought the chairs!
Brothers,
Don José brought the chairs!
Come quickly!
<i>O Lord my God,</i>
<i>When I, in awesome wonder,</i>
<i>Consider all the worlds</i>
<i>Thy hands have made</i>
Cast your burden on the Lord,
And He will sustain you.
He shall never abandon
he who falls.
Let us sing!
<i>Then sings my soul,</i>
<i>My Saviour God, to Thee</i>
<i>How great Thou art,</i>
<i>How great Thou art,</i>
<i>Then sings my soul</i>
<i>My Saviour God, to Thee</i>
<i>How great Thou art,</i>
<i>How great Thou art,</i>
Enough, brothers!
Now let's jump 26 times
to thank our Lord
for His mercy!
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five! Six!
Seven!
Eight!
Nine!
Ten!
Sixteen!
Seventeen!
Eighteen!
Nineteen!
Twenty! Twenty-one!
Twenty-two!
Twenty-three!
Twenty-four!
Twenty-five!
Twenty-six!
Hallelujah!
Brothers,
the good José has died!
No! No!
No, brother!
What a beautiful death
our brother had.
Each jump he gave
brought him to the heart of God
and there he remained.
For every free chair
he offered to the church,
let us thank God,
for he deserves a paradise
for each one!
Let's climb on the chairs.
Brothers and sisters!
What do you think
of making a collection
to pay for our brother's funeral?
Yes!
Who may live on Your holy hill?
<i>Who speaks the truth from his heart</i>
<i>Who speaks the truth from his heart</i>
That's all there is.
With this, he will end up
in the communal grave.
Sister,
take out what's in this pocket
and give it to the Pastor.
Put it in the hat.
You fool! You fool!
Down with international Judaism!
Heil!
Heil!
Chile for the Chileans!
Chileans for Nazism!
Nazism for Chile!
Nazism for Ibáñez!
Halt!
Extend your hand, friend!
I can't. It's withered.
Don't mock!
Extend your hand now!
I'm telling you I can't do it.
Fucking communist!
Extend your hand, bastard!
I can't do it.
Nor with this one!
He is mocking our salute!
We're all brothers.
Communist propaganda!
Beat him up!
You stupid Nazi!
Say: "Blessed be Don Jose!"
Blessed be Don Jose!
Again!
- Blessed be Don Jose!
- Again, or I'll rip your guts out!
- Blessed be Don Jose!
- You!
Blessed be Don Jose!
Blessed be Don Jose!
Blessed be Don Jose!
Woof! Woof!
Woof!
Blessed be Don Jose!
Who is Don José?
He's...
He's your father.
Confess.
Who is Don José?
He's your brother.
Who is Don José?
He's your son.
Keep going!
Who is Don José?
You are.
I'm going to blow
your brains out!
Who is Don José?
You are, I am, we all are.
Enough!
Confess!
I love you, Don José!
Easy!
Easy, comrade!
I'm here now.
Look at me.
You're free, comrade.
You're free.
The dictatorship is over.
Unable to solve the crisis,
Ibáñez has renounced power.
He fled to Argentina.
I wanted to kill him.
You are a hero, comrade.
You resisted torture.
Do you have a family?
Yes.
My family is in Tocopilla.
The least we can do
is take you back to your village.
Let's go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Be careful.
Papa has forgotten us.
I'm scared he won't come back.
Are you scared
he won't come back
or don't you want him
to come back?
I like it just the two of us.
He doesn't love me.
You're mistaken.
Put your ear here.
On my heart.
- Can you hear it?
- Yes.
What is it telling you?
My father is on his way home.
He'll be here soon!
Is that all?
No. It says he'll love me a lot too.
See?
When you feel
your mind is losing hope,
always listen to your heart.
Sara!
Jaime!
- It's you.
- Don't touch me.
I don't deserve it!
I had him in my hands
but they got paralysed!
I made you wait,
I sacrificed you needlessly.
I don't deserve your love.
I'm a coward.
No, Papa!
You're the strongest.
Men are never scared.
My Son!
My Son!
You are my soul.
You are my soul.
I will always
love you.
Enough, Sara.
Nobody will be able to cure me.
You can cure yourself.
Look at your god!
Look at the devil you admire!
No!
You found in Ibáñez
all you admired in Stalin.
No!
And here you are!
You are the same as they are!
You have lived in the guise
of a tyrant.
I am so sorry.
This man who feels and cries,
this man is you.
We love you
as you are now,
as, deep down,
you have always been.
Be yourself again.
Jaime!
Tocopilla.
<i>I soar away from the past,</i>
<i>Land in the body present,</i>
<i>Bear the painful burden of years,</i>
<i>Yet in the heart keep the child,</i>
<i>As the bread of life,</i>
<i>As a white canary,</i>
<i>As a worthy diamond,</i>
<i>As a lucidity without walls,</i>
<i>Wide open doors and windows,</i>
<i>Through which blows the wind,</i>
<i>Only the wind,</i>
<i>Just the wind.</i>
Casa Ukrania.
Casa Ukrania.
Our prices
are a miracle!
To your health!
