- Okay, all right, hold up.
[clinking glass]
Someone has to say
something nice
about my friend Herb tonight,
so I'm gonna give it a shot.
I have followed Herb Lee
my whole writing career.
I followed him through
three publishing houses.
I followed him
when he started his own.
It's embarrassing
to need your editor so badly.
That's how much
I followed this guy.
So I'm gratified to announce
that he has now followed me
to central Connecticut.
Thank you very much.
- I didn't follow you.
I had three heart attacks.
This was a preemptive strike
against decrepitude.
[laughter]
- Well,
whatever brought you here
to the beautiful
Marigold Retirement Community,
I just want to say
I'm glad that you're here,
right down the road
from my place.
And as long as Pippa
keeps making
that butterflied lamb,
I'll do anything, Herb.
I'll even caddy for you,
if that's what it takes.
- That's fine, as long
as I don't have to play golf.
- Okay, wait a minute.
Just wait. One more thing.
I just want to say
something else.
I have known Pippa Lee
for 25 years,
and I think that
I will never really know her.
She is a mystery, an enigma,

the very icon
of an artist's wife.
- What are you talking about?
- No, you are.
- And who precisely
is this artist
that Pippa's married to?
- [chuckles] Exactly.
- Exactly.
Yes, that's my point.
That's what it's come down to.
The one true artist's wife
left in the modern world,
and she ended up
with a publisher.
To Herb and Pippa
and their weird new condo.
- Yeah, I just have got
three new poems.
- Wonderful.
Well, if you'd ever like
to show them to somebody
who's nonjudgmental, I'd be
happy to take a look at them.
- Really?
I would like that.
That would mean so much to me.
- I really wish Sam
wouldn't keep saying
Daddy moved to be near him.
- Mom, he's a satirist.
Anyway, nothing's gonna
put a dent in Herb's ego.
It's you I'm worried about.
- It's time for dessert.
- But, Herb, what is
the real reason you moved here?
- Scaling down,
making life more simple.
I've liquidated everything
so that when I go,
Pippa and the kids
can get everything
and not give it
to the government.
- I thought
you loved paying taxes.
- I have to admit,
I actually like this house.
It's so easy.
- Well, I'm glad
you feel that way, sweetie.
- Though I can't help wondering
how many people have died here.
- Your problem is,
you're too adaptable.
You're the adaptable enigma.
- To be perfectly honest,
I've had enough
of being an enigma.
I want to be known.

Like many people,
I have lived more than one life,
so we're going to have to start
at the beginning.
- Breathe. Breathe.
- [groaning]
Shut up.
- I see the head.
Come on, one good push.
- Ahh! Fuck you!
[baby cries]
- Good girl. Good girl.
- My birth was marked
by several unusual occurrences.
First of all, I was covered
in fine blonde fur.
- Why is she furry?
- Oh, no, there's nothing
to worry about.
When a baby's this late,
it sometimes has time to grow
a little vestigial hair...
[chuckles] From the time
that we were monkeys.
- I had a monkey!
I had a monkey!
- You can expect to have
a beautiful baby girl.
The hair is just vestigial,
as I tried to tell your wife.
You know, I'm sorry
if it offends you, Father,
but we believe
that millions of years ago,
humans were covered with fur.
- I know that.
- So is it a baby or a pet?
- Suky knew my condition
had nothing to do
with evolution.
It was all her fault,
because my mother had a secret,
her own little stash of sin.
- [whistles]
How's my pal?
- I'm okay.
- Are you having a hard time
living here in Wrinklebury?
- It's strange having
so much time on my hands.
This place
is so easy to maintain.
But there's gonna be
charity work I can find.
- You want to move back
to the city?
- We just sold our apartment.
- Well, we can get
another one.
- Are you serious?
- No.
I'm just having a hard time
thinking of this
as the end of the line.
- I think
it's sort of romantic-
starting all over,
just the two of us,
so little stuff.
- Must you always look
at the bright side?
- Can I get you anything?
Some carrot juice?
- No, I'm fine.
What was that cheese
we had for lunch yesterday?
- It was vacherin.
I was so excited to find that
at the market.
- I love that cheese.
- Once I lost my furry coat,
my mother was so relieved
that she became sort of obsessed
with my appearance.
She even took a drawing course
at the town hall,
the sole purpose of which
was making pictures of me.
- Aw, sweetheart, you have
the most beautiful eyes.
I think God took
all of our best features
and put them on your face.
Don't you move.
Almost done.

with Giles Oppenheim.

- Did you hear

that got shot in Baghdad
last week?
- Uh-huh.

You heard about the bomb?
- Ben, shut up.
- What bomb?
- No, it's nothing.
- Yeah, she was with
that Oppenheim fellow...
- Ben!
- And they heard the whistle.
[whistles]
And he wanted to go left,
but she saw an alley
towards the right,
and she pulled him towards it,
and that's when the bomb hit.
And they turn around,
and what do you know?
If they'd gone left,
they would've been smashed
to smithereens.
She thinks she's immortal now.
- No, that's
a complete distortion.
Why can't you just ever
not say something?
- I do not know.
- Sweetheart, everybody knows
you're a killer,
but you got to be careful.
I mean, you have to use
your common sense out there.
- I do. Dad, look...

There's no way
that I'm not gonna go back.
If you had seen what I saw,
you would feel the same.
You would want

some sort of dignity.
- Just be careful.
- Anyway, I'm going
to Baghdad Saturday.
What's new with you?
- [sighs]
I found a book, a real cash cow.
- [laughs]
Since when do you say
"cash cow"?
- Well, I never said it because
I never found one before.

- Suky's energy
was unflagging,
day and night...
In spite
of an apparently weak thyroid,
for which she took pills
at 7:00 each morning,
12:00 noon,
and 4:00 each afternoon.
I was the only one who knew
she was secretly pretending
to be in a commercial
half the time

I thought she was
absolutely perfect.
- Mom, can I have
some more milk?
- Mom?
Then there were days
when Suky shorted out,
like a run-down robot.
- Eat up, kids.
- I always felt my real mother
had disappeared
in those moments.
It scared me
and made me angry.
I thought it must be my fault
that she was sad,
and it was up to me
to make her happy again.
- I thought maybe you forgot
to say good night.

other young wives here.
You see them jogging around.
- Is everything okay?
- Well, yes, we're-
we're fine.
But my son, Chris...
- In Utah?
- Yes.
- Right.
- He might be coming...east.
- Oh, well, that should be nice,
if they would move near you.
- Oh, well, the thing is,
he's had some kind of crisis
with his wife,
and he's left her,
and he's-
he's living in his car.
I just don't know
what to do.
Oh, he was always sort of
half-baked.
You know what I mean?
- You know, it's painful,
I know,
but sometimes you just
have to maybe accept
they are who they are.
I mean, I feel that
with my daughter.
- You're right.
I knew
that I should come to you.
You-
I just had a feeling.

Oh, God, that woman's

- Would you like to go in
and out of the doctor's office
every 15 minutes?
- We got to change our number.
I need an office.
Can we get an office here?
- What is the point
of having an office?
- The point is, I spent 40 years
building up this company,
and they're crapping it up.
They're children there,
absolute babies.
That way,
if I had an office,
I can be there
from 10:00 to 1:00.
I could talk to Marianne.
I could read my manuscripts.
And when I come home,
boom, I'm retired.
That way, when you and I
are together,
we're really together.

serious heart attacks.
Is that not enough for you?

Can you put it back, please?

it was speed.

- So what would happen
if you didn't take them?
- I'd get fat,

Is that what you want?
You all want me to walk around

- No.
- Why don't you just let me

Better yet,
why don't you help me?
Why doesn't anybody around here

The vertical beam points

The horizontal beam is the line

If you leave love

I bet if you anticipate
his needs

he'll be docile as a lamb.

Oh, I-I can't.
- Ben, your father
and Sandra were-
They-they're in love.
That's why I was leaving.
- What?
- I'll jump out the window.
I'm so stupid.
I'm stupid.
I'm just so selfish.
I'll jump out the window
if you don't forgive me.
I'm so...
- I forgive you.
Get up. Get up, please.
Okay.
- You do not forgive her.
- You're right. I don't.
- How could Dad
do that to you?
- Sweetheart, he...
was afraid of dying.
He fell in love.
And I wasn't altogether there
either, as of late.
So I don't know.
- Do you even care?
- How can I compete
with that?
- Hi. Where is he?
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Mrs. Lee?
You have a phone call.
- Okay, Ben,
will you take her in?
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.
Hello?
- I just want to say,
in all the world,
you are the one person
to whom none of this
should be happening.
- Thank you, Sam.
- And I also want to say
that I love you.
- Me too.
- I mean, really.
- Oh.
- Call you later.
- [slowly] Okay.
- Bye.
- Sam?
- Yeah?
- I don't want to make
butterflied lamb anymore.
- Oh.
- Do you see
what I'm saying?
- Why did Ben get to stay?
- I don't know.
He seemed to want it the most.
- Really?
How do you measure that?
Do you have some sort
of love-ometer?
- Why don't we go home for
a few hours and rest and then...
- Has someone
been smoking in here?
- I don't know.
- Yuck.
Was it Daddy?
- What?
- Well, if Daddy's been smoking,
then maybe-
- No. No.
- So his brain is just dead?
It's just completely dead?
He'll never say anything
ever again?
Not one thing?
- That's what the doctors
are telling us, sweetheart.
- You didn't even ask
for a second opinion.
[engine turns over]
- Gracie, I know, sweetheart-
- Good night.
- Why did you bother to lie?
- Oh, my God,
you are smoking.
- I'm quitting soon.
- But I have never
seen you smoke in my whole life.
- I know.
Aw.
- [sobs]
- I'm so sorry
this had to happen to you.
- I'm not crying
because of Daddy.
I'm crying because...
I'm so mean to you
all the time,
and I hate it.
And I don't want to be.
I really, really, really don't.
[crying]
- Sweetheart,
it's not your fault.
There's so many things
you don't know about me.
- No, not yet.
I want to be your friend,
because...
because we still have time.
- I'd be honored
to be your friend.
- No, not honored.
Just happy.
- Okay, happy.
- Mom.
[vehicle approaching]
- I saw your light on.
I wanted to see
if you needed anything.
My mom told me what happened.
- Oh, my son
is at the hospital,
and I'm supposed to be resting,
but I can't.
- I could drive you around
a little bit.
Do they have your cell?
- Don't you have work?
- I'm off till 5:00.
- I could write Grace a note.
Okay.
- I'm leaving soon.
- And where will you go?
- Back out west, I guess.
What do you pray for
when you pray?
- For my kids to be happy,
I guess.
And to be good.
It sounds so childish,
saying it out loud.
- Do you want to pray
for your husband?
- It's hopeless.
His brain is dead.
- Not for his brain.
For his soul.
- I don't know
how to do that.
- Me neither.
Let's try.
- [moaning]
[crying]
[softly]
Sorry.
Okay, Herb...
I'm gonna let you go.
I'm sure
you're pissed as it is
that I've left you
like this so long,
but we wanted to wait
for Grace.
[sniffles]
I love you anyway, you know.
I'll always love you,
you bastard.
- Are you ready now?
- Okay, it's time to turn
the corner.
I'm going to stay with Ben
and his girlfriend in town.
I'm gonna find a place
near them,
and I'm gonna wait
to become a grandmother.
[gasps]
[tires screech]
I'm awake.
- I just don't know
if we can get it all to work.
- Hi, Mama.
- I'm going on a trip.
- A trip?
- Yes,
and I was wondering
if you could call
these movers right here
and take whatever you want
and then tell them
to give the rest to Goodwill.
That would be great.
- What about
the memorial service?
- Right, memorial service-
just call everybody on here
except for Sandra,
and just call me on my cell
and give me the date.
And you know what?
What the hell? Invite Sandra.
- Mom, are you actually leaving?
- I'll be back.
- When?
- Sweetheart, your father
was in love with a woman
I cooked for two days a week
over the past four years.
I'm not going to organize
his memorial service.
[vehicle approaching]
- Who is that guy?
- He's my friend.
- A friend?
What's going on?
- Ben, I'm not driving off
into the sunset.
I'm just seeing
what happens next.
- I can't believe
this is happening.
- She's given us
half her life.
Don't you think
she deserves a vacation?
- Mm.
- [chuckles]
- I love you. I love you.
I love you.
I don't know how the rest
of my story will go.
I don't know
who I'll be in it.
All I know is, I feel like
this is just the beginning.
