Move, I want to see a weapon here
And a weapon there
Sergeant, split your squad
Set your weapons for close range
Laser sight interlock engaged
You ready to seal the room?
System's armed, sir
ready on your order
Prepare to seal the room
on my count
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Attention, all personnel
The room is sealed
I repeat: The room is sealed
Control two to the commander
I'm sure an intrusion is beyond
parameter three
Moving to check it out
Sector parameter three, scanning
Sector... I see it
Open the fire now
Nabel, this thing's been spotted
in target already
Frankly, I was expecting more
The company's expecting much more
Mr. Saggs, you'll just be patient
Must have missed
Holly molly, I'm taking shots here
Let me out...
AAV13, do you copy?
We've just lost contact
with command post three
Outside the second parameter
This is commander
We've lost contact with post three
Can you drop them some
temporary communications gear?
Screw that command
You didn't lose contact
you lost them. Over
Put rockets in that area,
hear me? Over
Check your goddamn screens
Where is he? Nabel
He's on his way
Move your armored personnel...
East sector to the west
keep them moving
Lost two sensors
What the hell is that?
Air 4, what the hell's
going on out there?
What are those explosions?
How many
are these things out there?
We need to attack
One. Repeat. One
We took a hit...
It passed
We are meat...
Jesus
Alright, everybody, stay cool
Holly shit, it's right outside
Stay cool...
Do it! Everybody, fire!
Hold your position...
Damn
This exercise has concluded
Security stand down
How many people know about this?
I'm the only one with the
complete picture, Mr. Sags
I split development between
divisions and different planets
That's why it cost so much
Yeah, it was expensive
Nabel, with enough of these
we can take over the world
Which world?
Earth, Nabel
The government has been hanging
by the thread for years
With a hundred of these...
How many have we got?
5,000
You astonish me!
A particle weapon
Nobody within five years will
have anything remotely like it
This thing turns them on and off
You want to activate them
You just click here...
And tell them your objectives
Here
I've assigned your voice as the
primary command of authority
Nabel, you are a genius
I'm proud of you
The company
will be very proud of you
If circumstances only permitted
I'll greenlight one great
hellacious bonus for you
And a promotion right on the spot
But with our objectives on Earth
You can see how that precludes it
I see
I know you would
After all, you are a genius
Of course
this all has to be deniable
From which you can unfortunately
infer that you too...
Have to be deniable
Destroy Dr. Nabel
No
No
Here approaches heavy freight
PKF 946
Requesting clearance
in the Inter Pork dock
PKF, reduce speed to 1,500
And contact the controller
on the designated frequency
This is John Canyon
Inbound from Mars City
Call Inter Pork
I've got 147 trailers
Of Martian genetically
square jacked up hogs
Which I naturally want to dump
as soon as possible
You got the dock open?
Canyon, this Keller of Inter Pork
packers dispatch
You are two day past due
You got my regrets, pal
Do you want those hogs or not
Mr. Keller?
You get them into C Dock, Canyon
Park your load and park your mouth
Bitching Betty
I'm checking on the cargo
As you wish, driver
Magnetic floor activated
How are you all doing?
You like that don't you?
Everybody happy?
So where's my beer
and when do I get paid?
You can unhook your rig, Canyon
Stop by the office in half an hour
I'll give you a check
I'll unhook when I got my money
no offense
You know that's not company policy
I know that
That's why it's my policy
not to unhook until I'm paid
You are late, plenty late
Didn't I apologize?
I got the hogs here in good shape
I did it as quick as I could
You knew my rig was slow
and you hired me for the job
I've taken that into consideration
That's why I'm willing
to offer you 1,500 credits
No, no... you owe me 6,000
You don't seem to get it
I've only offered you 1,500
out of impulsive generosity
I think it's time for you to leave
You are upsetting my pigs
Alright, Jackie
Go get him, Jackie
My pleasure
No... Jackie
That's not the way
to throw a punch in zero gravity
See, this is
the recommended technique
Shit
What the hell do you think
you are doing?
You are gonna pressurize the air
and kill us all
Canyon,
these hogs are company property
They belong to me until you pay me
Now get the hell off my rig
I'm gonna get a court order
you hear me?
You'll forfeit your right
of any payment
Yeah...
Do you hear me?
Cindy
Hi, John
Got only four weeks this time?
Yeah, I got lucky
I picked up a load of
square pigs on Mars
Who is this?
The name is Mike Pucci
Let's not get ahead of ourselves
You are a space trucker, kid?
Not yet
He's taking a solo today
Yeah?
Give me a hamburger well done
and a French fries
What kind of rig you're driving?
Pachyderm 2000
Pachyderm? Wow
So you've been driving
for a while I guess
It's hard to beat
that old lion kid
Student Mike Pucci
report to area T
That's me
Wish me luck, Cindy
Good luck, Mike
See you
Who's the kid? To you I mean
The customer, like you
I didn't always
use to be just a customer
Sorry, new rules
They're recycling
all leftovers ok?
Screw all that cheap bullshit
I don't like it better than you do
But I can't afford to get fired
especially now
What's going on?
Well, you know
my mother's on Earth right?
Maybe you mentioned it, yeah
She's gotta have an operation
and it's really serious
And I promised that
I'll be there with her
That's right, I'm sorry
So when are you leaving?
Leaving? You know what it takes
I'll have to pull double shifts
here for over a year
To get on my way out of here
Let me ask around
see what I can come up with
You are a good man, John
But you are not a company man
They only give Earth errands
to company people
And none of them has the balls
to risk taking me
I would give anything
You know what I want
Yeah
How many times I proposed to you?
Three?
I think you left out a few
Last couple of times
you were pretty loaded
Tell you what,
you agree to marry me
I'll get you to Earth
Cindy
Yeah right
It's a deal then?
John, you get me to Earth
And if you still want to marry me
when we get there
I'll do it
Alright, alright
I'm gonna get back to work
Right
Sonic pig
Cool, man
Yeah
Get the toll truck ready
I'll unhook the load
and meet you there
Ok
Hey, John
Still working independent, John?
Still own my own rig
pick my own loads
And don't sell ads space
on my tits
if that's what you're
talking about
You're back for Kev's funeral?
I didn't hear it
In his load
he got into the scum cluster
Not much of it came out
Hijackers killed him huh?
And then some
Who do you think got him?
There's this Captain Macanudo
That guy's a damn depraved animal
Captured Kev's load
All they sent back was his dick
Using a tennis ball for the coffin
Cremation would've had more
dignity if you ask me
Anyways, John, we're planning on
having a wake after the service
John
You held Inter Pork hogs?
Yeah, they are my hogs
until I get paid for them
Jesus, look at that
Some piece of garbage
wrapped in human skin
Is trying to jack my load
Yeah?
You want to see me, Mr. Keller?
Yeah, I understand you just
graduated from space truck school
Yeah
I need someone to
push a shipment of square hogs
To Little Chicago on Titan
Square pigs?
Isn't that John Canyon's load?
It's Inter Pork load
I fired Canyon yesterday
You got a feeling about that
one way or the other?
No
No, I barely know the guy
Good
Cause it's about 1,500 out of the
freight push so you want that job
Yeah, I'm the best
Your potential is frightening
You want the job?
I'll take it
Pick up your pink probationary
coveralls from ammos and supply
See you keep them clean
Pink, huh?
They are pink
Mike, congratulations
Thanks
John, Mike got himself a new job
Normally we'd have some kind
of blowout... for that
But I see from your pajamas
whom you're working for
Which is nothing to celebrate
John, not everyone
can be independent
Not everyone
can drive their own rig babe
John, I'm sorry
about your losing your job
It's my only shot
I'm out of money.
I'm out of credit
Somebody's gotta
get these pigs to Titan
You took a fearless
world of inventory, kid
And then you took my job?
If you can live with that, great
But I don't have to
Now you hump yourself down
to the other end of the ball
Look, I treat you with respect
I'm asking you to do the same here
Keller's here
Look, kid
Your boss brought the circus
with him
We've come to pay our respect
The circus
A pair of trained turds
are right here
He's just blowing steam,
Mr. Keller
The Kev thing got people upset
Slam your teeth, Delia
I want you off this hub, Canyon
I like to oblige you
If you'd paid me
I'd be gone by now
We've fueled your rig
Now move your ass down there
and off this station
I don't work for you
Ok
Somebody said something?
You don't mess with me, Canyon
And you never ever
mess with the company
Now hold on, Mr. Keller
The man's with his rights here
Step off, kid
The kid's a real space lawyer
Get away from me, Canyon
Jackie, do something
Jackie, do something
My god, somebody help me
Somebody, please
Jack, come on
Grab him
No, Cindy, get out of here
Cindy, get out
Give me your hand
Come on
Let's get out of here
It's the wrong door
Get in now
John, it's the wrong door
Get out. What are you doing?
John, close it
It's occupied
Nice lady
Come on in the cubicle,
both of you
Alright, check the stall
Get out, what are you doing?
It's occupied
This wouldn't be a social call
would it?
It's always a pleasure to see you
Mr. Zesty
I need to get off the hub
I need a load
It's problematic, John
Problematic
There are people who'd like to see
you put down like a diseased dog
Tons of people
How about I recite all the times
that I helped you out?
This and that... Here and there
And I should be the man to decide?
Yeah
I shall open my heart at once
I do have something
Something unpleasant I fear
We'll take it
I'm his partner
Says who?
What? You're saying I'm not?
I lost one job because of you
you owe me
If I stay here, they are gonna
mount my ass on the board
You're a passenger, not a partner
So what've you got, Mr. Zesty?
It's a rush shipment to Earth
Two-day schedule
Containers to the lab
in high orbit on arrival
He said Earth
We'll do it
What's the cargo?
The manifest states...
Polymer sexual substitutes
Sex dolls?
They're providing 5 times
of the going rate
Providing all the people forged
of course
Undetectable
I said... done
I hesitate to caution
a man of your experience
But the consigners of this cargo
were most emphatic
That the delivery schedule
being adhered to
And...
Don't temper with those containers
Is this gonna take long?
The troopers are all
over the place
No, I'm almost done
You see her coming?
No, you think the law grabbed her?
No, she'll make it
I like her
She's friendly
Yeah, she's got a kindly nature
You mind if I ask you
what the deal's with Cindy?
I don't get you
I think she likes me
I like to pursue her further
I'd like to know
if you're involved
If I get your drift
and I do get your drift
I must tell you that, Mike
A gentleman doesn't answer
a question like that
That's a no?
Sorry, I'm late
I had to give them
30 seconds notice
Here help me out
It's all right
Geez, my underwear
I haven't seen this before
It's a friend of yours?
Actually it's my mother Carol
It's taken before I was born
I can see where
you got your good looks from
Thanks
Wouldn't mind meeting her
back then
Yeah?
Yeah
Here we go
There
I've never seen trailers
like these before
They look kind of...
Creepy
They look like
they've come a long way already
What do you think is in them,
John?
I don't
Something really creepy
At maximum velocity
We'll still be 6 hours on the
wrong side of the delivery time
They can stand the ship being late
John, you wanna fill me in
on your plans
I don't ask yours
We're all in this
together alright?
I think you owe me and Cindy
the courtesy of an answer
Our system's functional
Pressure within acceptable range
Electronic systems to the full
John, the minute
we pull outta here
The transport troops are gonna be
all over us, you get that?
Now you just got to learn to
live with your fear
If it gets too bad, breathe into
a paper bag or something
Shut up
Crawl in the cell
You'd better power down, Canyon
I'm sorry, boys
I've got a priority load of
perishable goods here
It's not a request
We've got questions about Keller
Last time I saw him
He's being sucked ass first
into the outer darkness
John, I think these guys
are getting serious
We'd better stop
Yeah
Not while I still
have the options open
All units converge
Abandon pursuit
Repeat, do not pursue
We can get them, damn it
The orders are to abandon pursuit
I love taking orders
Looks like we lost them
More like they stopped chasing us
That was some of the best driving
I've ever seen
Thank you
Just put the paddle to the metal
And pray for what's in your fate
Breakfast is ready
You guys up there, food's ready
Mike, Cindy, come on
Are we on time?
We'll make it
We left Spensinan
About six hours ago
What's this?
Saliva activated
cappuccino and eggs
Don't you like it?
What the hell is that?
Some kind of floating junkyard?
Welcome to the scum cluster
What the hell happened to them?
Asteroids killed them
Asteroids? Where are they?
Where are they?
Yeah, where are they?
Warning, density 10 asteroid field
Freight driver
You're approaching too fast
for evasive maneuvers
Don't make me tune you off, Betty
John, this shows a big cluster
coming straight ahead
I don't see anything
It's got to be malfunction, right?
It's the black rock
Drive yourselves in
I think we are clear
I've never been so afraid
in my life
Look out
Ok, Cindy?
Yeah
Mike?
Yeah
I'm going for some light
How bad do you think it is?
It felt bad
Sure did
Betty, confirm what
I'm seeing here
Freight driver main and
secondary engines are down
Decompression inconsistency in a
component in direction control
Thanks, Betty
The internal pool system
has also shut down
You are welcome, freight driver
No chance of a fix?
Sure
After five-hour cool-down
We'll roast in here before then
It's getting hot in here
I think we've got two hours
before we burn up
Escape pod's no good
Too far away from
the nearest colony to make it
Anyway, it only holds two
What's that mean? We're gonna die?
There's always a chance
Our emergency beacons will
draw somebody before that happens
Somebody?
What do you mean somebody?
John
Sure, there's always a chance,
baby
Always a chance
We've got a little juice left
in the parking rocket
If we can cut the load loose
We should be able to put ourselves
in the shadow of one asteroid
Yeah, that'd give us enough time
to fix the main engine
Let's go
It's a one-man job
Be careful
You were born on Earth, Cindy?
Yeah, New York City
That's technically a part of Earth
Earth, I've always
dreamt about going to Earth
It's great
You know... birds, trees
Those things living in the rivers?
Yeah, fish
My mother used to take me
to see them a couple of times
Earth is an amazing place
It's so hot
Yeah
Do you mind?
No
I'll do the same
I feel so much better
John, how are you doing
out there buddy?
Some kind of automatic
seal deal here
I'm gonna try cracking it off
Alright, you do that
Let me know if I can help you out
Mike, we've gotta stop
Wait... wait
Stop, this happens all the time
Ok, realize one thing
I'm engaged
What?
It started out as a joke
John asked me to marry him
And I said sure
if you take me to Earth
It's total bullshit
A promise is a promise
John's a good man
I don't have to justify myself
to you or to anybody...
Ok, stop,
sorry
This is not gonna work
It's awfully warm in here
Toughly hot in here isn't it?
So let's take your clothes off
be more comfortable
Right?
Yeah
Would that have been your idea?
It was my idea, so what?
I think it's a pretty cheesy way
to look at my fiance's tits
Knock it off, John
That's not what's
going on here at all
I got to hand it to you, Mike
king of the smooth dogs
"Oh, it's hot in here
your husband is outside..."
We're not married alright?
How about a guy who forces a girl
to marry him in exchange
of a lift?
I'd like to know what you think
Hey, stop it...
Stop fighting over a girl
Who's gonna be two scoops of ash
in about two hours
We're gonna die here, ok?
Why don't try for a little dignity
for a change?
I can't unhook the load
There's some kind of auto-defense
mechanism on the containers
Whatever's in them
ain't no sex dolls
A plastic date wouldn't
need that kind of protection
Yeah, tell me about it
So what are we gonna do now?
Why don't we divert the cooling
From the refrigerator
through the inside plumbing?
It's a great idea
It'd give us something to do
anyway
Pachyderm 2000 rig...
It don't have a refrigerator
Why the hell not?
Because it's an option
I don't buy options
Like it's either the suede seats
Or half tinted portative
silent suck toilets
I don't buy options
Ok, ok
But I did bring this
Suck a Zux
At least we've got some notice
It's the time to
prepare ourselves for the end
However you do that
Attention, freight driver
We've been approached by
an oligarch class passenger liner
Passenger liner,
we are being saved
There's likely to be some
conditions attached to that
Liner identified
former vessel A7 N843
Vanished 10, 24, 92
It didn't vanish. It was jacked
These guys are jackers, man
If it's who I think it is
Boy, you're lucky you're not
wearing those company pajamas
Come on, let's go
Get that hatch open, come on
John, how many guns you've got?
I'm not even sure
if this one works
They are here, man
If you're not gonna use it
give it to me. I'll use it
You're gonna make one of them
desperate lie-and-stands?
Say we know these scums
may have in mind for us
What do you think
they're gonna do to her?
Mike, there's not a lot we can do
We just hope our cooperative
attitudes are at our disposition
What do you have in mind, Mike?
We'll hold them off
as long as we can, then...
What?
I'll save two shots for both of us
Great, yeah
Can you put that thing away
someplace safe ok?
We're not gonna let them take us
Give me the gun
Mike, I've got to go to Earth
If I got to wait and do nasty crap
I'm still going
Everybody, come on, move
We don't work for the company
remember that
We are friendly, friendly
Drop it
We don't work for the company
Over to the control panel
move it, now
We're going...
You're all prisoners of the
Regalia if anyone's curious
If you try to escape
you'll be killed
If you resist, you'll be killed
If you fail to obey orders
you'll be killed
What the hell
We'll probably kill you anyway
Alright, get them out of here
Come on. Move it. Get out
Get your hands off me
Move them out...
Come on
We don't work for the company
Move it
Sorry
Come on
Ok, stay with me
Look at that
Salvage specialist
Shut up. What do you hold?
We don't know
I'm telling you we don't know
never cared
It's a mistake to give up caring
That's too much
Macanudo wouldn't like it
You leave the captain to me
My pleasure
Cutt, man
The manifest says what
they're carrying is sex dolls
Sex dolls?
What do you think
they are really carrying?
Gotta be something hot.
Drugs maybe
You like drugs or guns best, Lou?
Drugs man
I like guns better
Scummy
Yeah
Hook them up
This way
Where's Captain's equipment?
Over here
Manifest says they carry sex dolls
Thank you for apprising me
Mr. Cutt
I do know how much you like
to be apprised sir
You have been perspiring
It's about 170 in the cab
I compliment you, my dear
You have a strong, distinctive
And not altogether
unpleasant body odour
It's gratifyingly approachable
Captain we want to thank you
for saving us
We're grateful about it, thank you
I didn't save you
you company scumbag
I jacked your load
Whatever, we appreciate it
It's important that you understand
we do not work for the company
I want to know what your cargo is
Who's the shipper
and who's the consignee?
We don't know none of that
You're gonna kick yourself later
If you have trouble
to inform yourself
I'd have to slice off
your manly process
Is he talking about my dick?
Captain, we're just
independent contract haulers
We're trying to make a living
We don't ask a lot of questions
What we do know...
Is whatever's in those cars
is not something to mess with
Do I look like someone
to mess with?
No, sir
Like I have the IQ of
an egg timer?
No
I see high security double-duty
containers in your hauling
I'd say the pair of you
are company butt boys
Wrong
If you want to hack off my dick
do it
And I'll change my name to Terry
or Lee or something neutral
That ain't gonna change
what I know
Your dick?
Is this your dick?
No
That one's mine
Ok, I'm gonna put some
Fermat theorem in my head
That takes between 8 and
17 seconds
And then we'll begin again
Captain's a genius
Yeah
I was head of company's
research and development
Top man
Slotted for the big dogs
I was betrayed
by that bastard E. J. Saggs
Found out before he killed me
Made a mistake of having it done
in the laboratory
I was able to save myself
We create my body
You are a very attractive woman
In the normal course
of human affairs
You probably
wouldn't look twice at me
Captain
where are we going with this?
I'm going at the beauty
like other men
The beauty... beauty fills my
life's holes so to speak
Were you not chained to a major
support beam of my ship
I wouldn't stand a chance of
having sex with someone
As so alluring as you
Leave her alone
you half-wit asshole
He didn't mean that
He respects the brave way
you confront your disability
Kill him
Wait
Mr. Cutt
I've got to go to Earth
I've got to see my mother
So keep the load and
give us the...
I'll have sex with you
Really?
Yeah.
Right there on the floor
if that's what you want
I think we should prepare
to my quarter, my dear
Scummy
John, we've got to do something
What are we going to do?
Just sit here?
Don't corrupt the right
to be indignant, kid
She's my fiance
What will make you
more comfortable, my dear?
I have seven different
forms of sedation
Alcohol
The usual pharmacology
Let's not fool ourselves, Captain
I just want to get this over with
I can accept that
However, I'm confident I can make
you a favorable impression
I rebuilt my own mind
So you got a homemade brain
I rebuilt everything
Every organ
I've made a low-amp
electrical wiring pulse
Designed to drive women
wild with pleasure
Stop, you're gonna make me puke
Quit talking or the deal's off,
ok?
Please allow me a few moments
To coordinate my seldom-used
reproductive sequence
Yeah, sure
Lou, this casing's made out of
some exotic alloy
This security seal, man
It's something new
I wouldn't mess with that load
It's bad. It'll eat you alive
My heart is racing, Mr. Truckman
Ok, Sam
Hit it
You alright?
The diamond blade just shattered
What the hell does that?
One of those things
We're gonna try something else,
Lou
Yeah
What the hell is that?
Sam
Sam... are you alright?
What's cooking?
Something's cooking
What are you talking about?
Smells like somebody's
making hamburgers
Goddamn, Sam, it's you
Sam...
What did I tell you?
Shut up
I've got to tell the captain
John, we've got to do something
What do you think
they're doing to her up there?
It's not the first time
she's doing it for the team
You wanna lose that?
It's gonna give me nosebleed
It's my good-luck charm
I never take it off
Just close your eyes
and think of Brooklyn
You bitch!
Nothing personal
You've just made the
biggest mistake of your life
Speak tough for a guy
who can't get up on his back
You'll never get off the ship
Yeah? Watch me
Mr. Cutt
There you are, Captain
Lou just went
looking for you, the load...
You want me to leave
Alright, Captain, ok
Back awfully quick
aren't you Captain?
She write you out?
Kill them, huh?
What? What?
You want to kill them, absolutely
You want me to cut them down?
You don't mind if I tenderize
them a little bit first?
Scummy
You overblown cretin
Aren't you in need of some fixing?
I'm sorry you couldn't find it
in your heart to give me a chance
You could've been
my beloved concubine
Share my position here
I guess it was not
in my fortune cookie
Now all you'll share is my crew
312 of them in random order
But first, you can watch me
kill your friends
Or if you prefer
you can turn the other way
Do it
Captain, did it occur to you that
A load with that kind of
protection ought
to be checked out first?
After you, Mr. Cutt
Yes, sir
Right behind you, Lou
Come on, get in there
Man!
Holly shit
What the hell is all this junk?
These are my babies
Captain
State of the art
disintegrators, boys
This baby will bake a man
in 500 milliseconds
And leave his watch and
small change lying on the deck
Just... what have we got here, sir?
We've got Saggs
We've got E. J. Saggs
right by his shriveled scrotum
A little reprogramming
and the company is mine
Ours, if you will
And I'll feed Saggs' liver
to the ship's rats
Look at this. This one is missing
What?
Damn
What's that do, Captain?
Quiet
It's coming!
Kill it...
What the hell is going on here?
I don't know
but I bet we get blamed
Let's get out of here
Bite it deathnut, asshole
Get ready. Let's go
Five minutes to complete cool down
We ain't got five minutes
Fire it up would you, Mike?
We made it
I can't believe we got out
of there
I gotta say I'm
very very happy to be here
Godamn I am
Me too
Of course you always feel that
way after a near miss
It wears off
Attention, freight driver
There's a breach in the
exterior hull of container One
The pressure and oxygen
levels falling
We've got a vacuumed container
it's too bad
The load's perishables
always perish
Yeah, so forget it
Wait a second. Did somebody hear
something back there?
Does it sound like
something's back there?
I do
Bitching Betty, take over
Mike, suit up
Cindy, move over here
Sit here. You watch these gauges
You see a red light come on
You shout at me on the radio, ok?
Alright
I want you to elaborate
on your instructions
Bitching Betty
you hold the course toward Earth
You'd better keep this ok?
It's an SOS
Yeah, it can also be a trap
Light me
There's a flamer in my pocket
Maybe I should
get the first aid kit
Forget it
I cauterized the main arteries
But I don't have much time left
What happened back
there to Regalia?
Soldier...
They are activated to do
what they're programmed to do
You're one of the... our cargos
you know what's in them?
An army
What?
I made them for the company
Genetically engineered
Biochemical super warriors
My babies... you can't stop them
There's got to be some way
to shut those bastards off
We're doomed
I'm afraid
If I had an anus...
I'll probably shit over myself
You got to tell us
how to stop these things
They activate in the waves
1,2,4,8
This thing here locks them up
You boys got a use for this?
He's gone
Yeah
For a son of a bitch
gang rapist murderer
He died ok. Come on
John
John! Do it
I should go check it out in there
We need some light in here
I've got a flashlight
It ain't exactly made
for the space
It's made for reading
under the blanket isn't it?
Damn
This thing doesn't work
until they're all grown up
Let's... get back outside
and wait for them
Yeah
Come on...
Here
John
Everything ok back there?
We don't know yet
I can't see anything
Isn't that supposed to be
four of them?
Yeah
Where's the other two?
Cindy, put your spacesuit on
They are headed toward the cab
Do it, John
Freeze them
Do not damage or destroy
your means of transport
to Earth...
It's programming
They can't break their truck
John, he's got a Swiss army knife
Shit, man
Cooking time estimated 45 seconds
Next time there's gonna be eight
We'll go into the Earth orbit
So when I cut the load loose it
will drop them in the atmosphere
And incinerate those mutant guys
I want the two of you to get in
the escape pod and get out of here
No, we'll go with you
You ain't being asked
Mike, you drive the pod
So what's the plan, John?
Well... I'm gonna try to
free the cargo
Blow it if I have to
Then I'm gonna ride the rig down
John, the goddamn rig will never
make it to the atmosphere
Get serious
Kid, this is a Pachyderm 2000 rig
It was mine before you were born
I know what it will do
Now I've got something
to say to both of you
Cindy, I'm releasing you
Of all your obligations
to marry me right now
I want to apologize
for the way I've done it
It weren't right
And I guess I've been jealous
Since I saw the way you two
behave to each other together
John, you don't
have to apologize really
I don't do it so well anyway
Probably because
you've never done it before
My advice to you is you take
this woman to the church
At the first exit off the freeway
and you get hitched
You are a lucky man
Alright, partner, kick butt
We're about ready here, John
How is it going buddy?
Oh, it's hanging by a thread
I'll have it cut in no time
I can practically kick it apart
No sign of any genetic deal
So go on, get out of here
John, I figure we'll try for
the Palmdale spaceport
You can bring your rig in there
Yeah, it sounds good
I'll see you there
Betty, how much time
before we hit the atmosphere?
32 seconds, freight driver
Entering the atmosphere
Had enough for you?
There he is
Look, Mike, is that smoke?
It's bound to be smoke
The seal's burning off
Come on, John, come on, baby
Come on... He's getting closer
He's gonna make it
He's gonna make it
Here he comes
My god
My god, Mike
Hey... Look here
You are married yet?
Good to see you
We interrupt this program
for a special news update
Two space truckers and a waitress
Have saved the Earth
from the invasion from outer space
The three of them discovered
They were carrying
an army of robotic warriors
Sent by persons unknown
to conquer our planet
Mom
I have Mike and John here with me
Oh, just a second
Would you like us to come back
when you're more recovered?
No, I'll be right with you
Sit down
Can we get you anything,
Mrs. Welch?
Get this Mike, call me Carol
Mom
Mom
This is Mike
Mike yeah, welcome to the family
This is John
Oh yeah
You are Carol Welch?
Cindy is your daughter?
This Cindy?
What? Do I look weird
or something?
You look great... and beautiful
Like a picture I saw of you
But the picture was taken
twenty years back
Could somebody tell me
what's going on here?
You see when I got sick
they offered me a choice
Die or get frozen
Anyway, I got the deep freeze
They thawed me. They cured me
Here I am
They froze you?
Well, there's a lot of
fancy names for it but...
Yeah
I don't look freeze or burnt do I?
Not from what I can see
Special agent Ridgid
I'm taking charge here
What do you want?
Pat them down
What?
I'm head of presidential security
We'll secure this room
for presidential visit
The president?
The president of the world
is coming here?
Yeah?
Mr. President...
Ok, Ridgid, move along
Shoot
I'm President Saggs
I'm here to express the gratitude
of my administration
And my constituents
All the people of the system
Saggs? E. J. Saggs?
I thought the president's name
was Dobey
Dobey is the former president
He resigned last week
The government's been privatized
We know who you are Saggs, ok?
You sent those things to Earth
And you cost us a good rig
And you almost got us killed
about 50 times
Take it easy
You are talking to
the president here
I'll grant you
there've been mistakes made
And there've been lies told
But I assure you
whatever you've been told
I was not aware
and I was not involved
You were not aware, right
Could it be that some individual
in the company
Just overreached himself?
He sent these things to Earth
as a kind of insurance policy
In case the merger task broke down
But I wouldn't like this sort of
rumors to be circulating
During the crucial days
of my administration
Or... Ever
No problem
Just so happens there's
a new rig ready to take off
And it's waiting for you there
on Gantry F
What do you think you
are gonna do?
Buy us a tuna fish sandwich?
I've also arranged
To have your mother's hospital
bill taken care of
Hold on a second
For your other troubles...
Maybe this will compensate
to some small degree
We didn't do what we did for money
Money doesn't fix anything
alright?
You have our cooperation
and our silence sir
Good. Good
Well, I must run
Remember our hush-hush
Yes, sir
Thanks for everything
Mr. Independent
What was that about?
You're gonna keep this?
No, we're not gonna keep it
We don't want no part
of that money
You guys could really
use that money
Getting married and all
We don't want that kind of money
You two don't get it do you?
If you don't take this money
And shut up about what happened
They're gonna come after you
And you'll disappear
Now you got to take it
We got to take the money
We got to take this
And become company butt boys
for the rest of our lives
I want to make sure
that you understand the facts
You're gonna take it, John?
Are you gonna take it?
No, but I don't want you
to end up like me
God forbid
Somebody fried Saggs
You know, I think it was us
Oh, my god
We'd better get out of here
Come on
Too bad Saggs blew himself up
We've never got to thank him
for the new rig
Alright, here we go
I've never done this before
Any chance I'll lose my lunch?
You'll be fine
