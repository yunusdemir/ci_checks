Next.
May I come in?
Yes.
What's your complaint?
You know, cough.
Cough? Bad one?
Yeah.
Dry or with phlegm?
Dry one.
Undress.
Almost gasping.
Ok, I see.
Undressed? Go to the desk.
Do you smoke?
Yes.
A lot?

Cut-cut-cut!
Mels!
Can you walk?
Ouch, it hurts a lot!
So can you walk?
Wait, I'll fetch the guys.
You don't have to.
I probably broke the leg.
All because of you.
Okey..
Stand up.
Stand up, stand up.
What's your name?
Mels.
And yours?
Polina.
Polly.
Police, ...
Why Polza?
You'll find it out soon.
Now, you know too.
Come to the Broadway.
You won't waste your time.
What a nice evening..
Why won't some people just live as others do?
Yeah. How could this happend, Mels?
Didn't run down.
You?Champion of the faculty?
I am telling you, Katya...
I stumbled and fell into the water.
It can happen to anybody.
I just can`t understand why are speaking so easely about it? "Didn`t run down!"
We don't play tag here.
Every dandy is a potential criminal.
There's only one step from saxophone to knife
Know what, commissar...
I`ll better whrite a report tomorrow, ok?
How I ran, how I stumbled and fell into the water.
Al right, Mels, don't be like this.
I'm your friend though.
Don't take it so hard.
We`ll find that dandy freebee.
She won`t  escape.
The man and cat are crying by the window,
Grey rain is dripping on the glass.
The E.R. is coming to the man and the cat,
The poor man got his brain contracted
Doctor is coming, coming through the snow plain,
The doctor is carrying healing powder.
The man and the cat will take that powder,
Grief and melancholy will subside.
The man and the cat are counting hardly the days,
The grey ceiling instead of blue sky.
The man and the cat fly at night,
But the dream doesn't come true.
Doctor is coming, coming through the snow plain,
The doctor is carrying healing powder.
The man and the cat will take that powder
Grief and melancholy will subside.
Where are you, where are you, ambulance?
The man is crying in the toilet.
But the walls are deaf, the pipes are like veins,
And the toilet cistern beats fast like a heart.
Doctor is coming, coming through the snow plain,
The doctor is carrying healing powder.
The man and the cat will take that powder,
Grief and melancholy will subside.
Where have you been all the night again?
On duty.
Come here, sit.
Don't start again, mum...
Can`t you understand that I`ll be fired...
That I`ll be sweeping the yard...
If I can be trusted a brooom...
How can I manage people...
When I`ve grown up a spy in my house.
For 10 years since the death of your father I  was..
so strictly amenable. Where are your lousy clothes?
Where is your American trash?
I`ll throw it out! I`ll burn it!
You'll go naked outside, b%$ch!
You have everything. What do you need else?
Ungrateful swine you are.
What for did I bring you up?!
To let you flash with your panties from under the skirt?!
What are you looking at? What are you looking?
You, little bitch!
Haven't I whipped you enough? Huh?
I should've beaten you till bloody sniffles!
Tanya, let's go to Broadway with us.
I invited you hundred times.
No. no. I can't.
Calm down, people! Calm down!
It's not a circus!
Whoops...
Look, there he comes all by himself.
Dudes!
Are there scissors?
It's time we put the sleeve on him
There is nothing to cut!
A tuft of hair from a mangy mare!
I`ve been invited.
Who invited you?
Polly.
She called and I came.
Well, hello.
Hi.
Are you healthy?
Yes.
It seemed that you stumbeled yesterday.
It was only a vision.
Ah, well.
Bye.
Be careful, you`ll get poisoned.
Hey, watch over.
Whoops!
Hi!
Hi!
Glad to see you.
Hi, Chick.
Hey, what is going on here? Huh?

What is the dance itself?
Dance is rhythmic body movement.
For example, Vien dance, or classical.
Dislocation of vertebra...
What?
Never mind.
forward movement
Jazz instead of classical style is...
Oh, Come on!
There are three main styles: atomic, Canadian and double Hamburg style.
Can we skip the theory?
Ok. You're man, I'm a girl. Let's go!
Hands off!Paw the gals, not me!
What should I do?
Something like this.
First of all, this. What are you doing with your hands?
Any chick'll hit you if you're runnig this way
Well, from the right leg.
Hold yourself more straight!
Move your legs and do not yawp!
Feel free. Like that.
A sportsman?
Yep.
Now squat a little..and twist!
No need to be here stronger-faster-higher.
Just need..drive.
Well..energy. From here.
..I like boogie-woogie, I'm dancing boogie-woogie every day.
To become a real dandy,
Buddy, you should dance good.
You must know the canadian style
It's all serious here, it's not the polka or the quadrille.
There's atomic style, and hamburg-triple style
light on your feet
You like boogie-woogie.
You like boogie-woogie.
You like boogie-woogie.
You like boogie-woogie.
Hello.
Son...
What are you doing in this house in our absence?
We`re just dancing.
In this country, where you can`t even sneeze aloud
without got pulled...
He is just dancing.
Eventually, punishment  under article "idolization of  the West"
nobody has cancelled.
Please, take a look at yourself...
Even your hairdo goes for this article.
Well, ok..
Who is this young man?
My comrad.
And why you are so trustful?
Borya..
This young man has a handsome appearance of
NKVD agent.
But why it's necessary to suspect anybody and everybody?
And do you know what's this?
And why it's here?
preventive custody.
Uncle Adolf got to the prison only beacause of his politically wrong name.
And aunt Fira went there...
Because she put a Stalin's portrait in front of a WC door.
But they even didn't explain me why I was in the prison.
But those impressions...
I'll remember it for my whole life.
But Dad! It`s impossible to live such way!
With this locked door, with this fucking case!
You`re a doctor, you should understand it!
nervous breakdown
Borya...
What`s it, Mom?
If you don't care about yourself - take it at least about me and dad.
Sonny, aren't your pants too tight?
You can try a...
Silicate glue.
Or all of a sudden rain?Or just a street sprinkler?
And..it'll tumble down.
Mels.
What?
Are you crazy?
What`s the matter?
Crisis occurance in USA economics.
Are you going like this outside?
Exactly. Or i was detraining at night for nothing?
Father, tell him!
What? I like it!
We also used to dress in the village to scare girls.
We got so decked out people couldn't speak when they saw us.
Hello.
Hello, Mish.
Hi.
Hello.

You should drop by drop squeeze out from yourself..
A slob.

"Made in Tambov?"
I think, I have one left somewhere. I'll bring it.

Easy, people. It's a reserved for us.
They're with us. We paid.
Booked out.Booked out.
She's with us too.
Why are you late today?
Let's go dancing atomic.
Are you always so pushy?
I`m not pushy
I`m purposeful
I'm not a prize cup for you.
And what should I do?
Hey, dandies, hello! We hang out on broadway.
And left boring slobs behind.
I`ve told you about jazz and freedom
I've put a stylish tie on you.
Oh,  my little babe,
Stay with me.
Oh, my little babe,
I'm your playboy.
Oh, my little babe,
Don't you leave me.
Oh, my little babe,
swallow
Hey, dandies, come with me!
Through forbidden doors!
If they catch us, I'll solve the problem.
If you don't have a place to check your feelings,
I'll find for my friend the keys from the room.
Oh, my little babe,
Stay with me!
Oh, my little babe,
I'm your playboy.
Oh, my little babe,
Don't you leave me.
Oh, my little babe,

Calm down, dudes, calm down.
We're on Broadway.
Mel, your guys.
Hey, guys.
Good evening, Katya.
What does it mean, Mels?
Nothing.
Hello, commissar, it's me!
It's just another suit.
You have one.
And I have another.
You see, simply another, Katya.
You're worth than an enemy, Mels.
You are betrayer.
Katya, don't start it again! Katya...
Let's go.
Katya...
Stand at ease
Well, problem is solved even without calling my dad..
Hey, dude, do you know where can i bye sax?
Maybe you need a mashine gun also?
Interested in having sax?
I do.
It's not my problem if there won't be a deal.
There is a dandie. He's looking for a sax.
Hello.
Good day!
How old are you, buddy?
20.
and you still don't know in what amasing contry we live?
Bayan is permissible, accordion is not permissible
Clarinet is a correct instrument
And sax is equated with a cold steel
Come back in 10 years
When jazz will be played on morning perfomances in kindergartens.
And then we'll speak.
Listen, I understood you. But I need it now.
I have a money.
Mamba and twist, jimy, foxtrot and tango
I played it many times in my life
I'm very hi ranked captain.
schooner
It's better for it to be a submarine in this country.
Better to be a submarine!
Jazz in this country have no place to stay.
Jazz have no place to stay!
I filled up my holds with wine and vodka
But never could not turn my way
But I really this joy

Ok
Thank you. Good luck.
Oh girls, you see...

Ok. I'll catch up with you.
So, look, Mel...
There are some kinds of the girls in the age that interests us
First, this is a real chicks
Numder of them is small.
Some of them are "borukhi". Well, they... they "borayutsya" with us.
I hope, you understand, what  i mean.
Number of them is less then small.
Want some?
There're also "pink-cheeked breads".
Breads?
Yeah.
Mother doesn't let to dress stylish, but they Realy want. Understood?
I did.
Hah! Also there are slobs.
I know'em.

And who is Polza?
Polza is Polza
That's all. Now teach yourself.
Duk Ellington. Mandibular dislocation...
It happens usually then patien yawns too wide...
Or took a bite of apple.
Sorry.
Come here.
Come.
Beautyful, isn't it?
I was hanging around...
I was looking for you...
Why?
I want to say you something.
I love you.
This is serious.
Very...
Ok.
I want to kiss you.

Hold on.
What?
I need to see sir John.
What?
I need to go to the restroom.
A...
I'll be back soon.
Sleep easily at night mum, We support the Dynamo!
Don't be so sad
Fred, does she have someone?
Take my advice. If it's only for fun, then find something easier.
It's serious.
Then listen...
Every boy here... and a 100 more will say, that they slept with her...
And this will be lie.
Everyone tried, and everyone... gets nothing
And you?
Oh, I'm have absolutely no chance.
Because my dad is diplomat, becase i study in MGIMO.
Becase I have a car and this apartments.
But she...
Pol'za
She always doing things the other way round.
Listen...
Have you ever... been with a girl?
So, you put a girl in your bed.
And what next?
What's the difficulty?
Oh, know-nothing!
Why should I teach you all?
Take this, and read.
It will make sense.
But only at home, well and truly secure.
Eat it on emergency.
Like a spy eats his secret addresses, understand?
(Knock in the door)
Are you alive in there?
Everybody wants to, get out!
Come on!
Go, go, go!
I see..
I can see your eyes again.
This is a reflection
Of my love.
All world
I turned easily into you,
Everywhere I see you.
Let everything be as you wish,
Let yours eyes shine as they did before,
I'm with you again tonight,
Next night,
If you want,
I'll be yours again.
For me it doesn't matter
Which day it is, what time.
The time has stopped,
There is just sky and light of your eyes.
I'm free and happy,
And this song is about,
Something that we've known - life is so wonderful.
Believe me right now, you'll understand it later.
Let everything be as you wish,
Let yours eyes shine as they did before,
I'm with you tonight again
Well, however,
Next night,
If you want,
I'll be at your place again.
My friends and brothers!
I gonna share my happiness with you.
It'll be enough for everybody today
I know that and I'm not afraid
I hope, that on this stage
Everyone someday
Will sing such words like mine
Words of love.
Let everything be as you wish,
Let yours eyes shine as they did before,
I'm with you tonight again,
Well, however,
Next night,
Next night,
If you want,
I'll be at your place again.
Train, guys!
Let's go!
Come on, chop-chop!
Ooooo!
Don't switch on the music, don't use the bathroom
The mascara is wiped off, the clothes are rumpled,
I forget the school, my mum , the shame.
And there is a run on the nylon stocking.
Every ban is making me laugh.
I don't care for rough rules.
And only you will know how I am.
The badges on the grey jackets,
In faces only boredom or fear.
I was like everybody, before I met you.
But life is gonna change now,
We'll go out of this door together,
And we'll be side by side at any cost.
The run of minute hand, the neighbors behind the wall..
The world will never be the same.
It'll be different, 'cause you're with me,
We need each other like air and water.
Ouu, girl from the eighth form..
Hello, Mels.
Hi, commissar.
I have a name. Did you forget?
Hello, Katya!
How it'll be your way?
Katty?
I can't even imagine...
Are you waiting for somebody?
for you
Can I ask you as an old friend?
Our record-player is broken, and you are the best in this area
How are you saying this...?
Always ready!
He's a dandy. We should put him into cell to scare children.
Don't you feel seek of walking close to him? You're a girl!
You better take off your komsomol sign!
Katya, it will be easier for you if we walk on different sides of the street and meet each other near your place.
No, I don't need to.
I just want to know, how do you feel when people look at you this way?
I like it!
It's funny!
You`re falling down!
That's great, Katya, when all people are different!
I'm like this. She's like this.
And you is totally different.
Get down!
Can you walk normally?
I don't want to be a different.
Why?
Because I don't imagine myself to be better then other.
You're not better, you're not worse, you're just different! Do you understand?
Katya! Do you have a thin screwdriver?
I'm looking...
This?
You are so beautiful, Katya.
It's mom's
Do you like?
I do
Well, got looking like a human being.
Thank you.
Take it easy!
Look..
Look, you're so beautiful!
Look.
Do you see?
So many things happened during last time!
Can you imagine, Semen caught up an armed criminal, face to face, on the station.
He had a knife, and Semen caught the edge by bare hand!
He is in a plaster now, there are somthing in newspaper about him.
And I thought you're tried to catch up only us.
Oh, come on!
And Ivan married.
You know her, It's Luba. Well..big..She were putting the shot in sports day.
Do you remember?
Is it interesting for you?
Sure.
Let's drink one more.
Ok
for what?
for you.
Do you want me to turn on music?
You mean this your... "Boogie Bones"?
Yes.
I want!
Katya, what are you doing?
Katya!
Katya, stop it! What if your parents will come?
They won't. I made them go to the theater.
Katya, did you get crazy?
This is all that you want from her. Am i worse?
so, did you decide to rescue me?
I don't need it.
I'm fine
But you told me that I'm beautiful.
You're really beautiful, Katya.
But I love her,do you know?
Whom?
This bitch?
This prostitute?
You even don't know her.
That's a bit thick knowing her!
Ok, Kat', I`m going out.
I'm sorry, Katya
Go away! Go away!
I`m sorry, Katya.
Go away!
I'm going.
Go away, away!
Go away
myaso and turtle.
Stop to taunt the animal!
Come to my room.
I'm coming.
So, Fedor, I call you every time before we're going back, right?
And do you have enough time to tidy up all around?
Yes.
So can you explain why in my office...
Did I find this "armour"?
Betty.. I'm sorry, dad!
I understand it's possible to leave a hair-pin, or scarf, or..virginity eventually. I'm sorry.
But how could she go without a bra, I cann't understand.
One time, Fedor, mother can find it.
And I'll have the problems. Me, not you!
Understand?
Ok
I'll check everybody by myself.
Hold on. I need to talk to you.
Did you take?
No!
I'll kill you.
So let`s talk seriously
Hide it!
Fedor, I always speak as a minister, and now I'll try to influence
You will go to USA for practice...
Where? In America?!
Hold on.
I want you to understand that it's not a pleasure trip.
This is a first step in your career.
If everything goes well, you'll come back to finish the university. And you'll work there as a helper of third secretary in embassy.
Do you agree?
Oh, dad!
I asked you! Yes or no?
Yes.
Are you ready to do everything for it?
Of course.
Ok
So I have three conditions.
Tomorrow you'll change this clown's dress for normal Soviet clothes.
Then you'll go to barber's and change you hair style.
To ideologicaly right boxer cut
Now second.
Tomorrow you'll see your friends the last time.
Sorry for the cynicism, but there are some rules.
And you should conform to this rules or you can work in the factory.
I used to dance in pubs too in your age
And, believe me, that your silly hanging out on broadway.
Is just a bad made parody on what we had
Infantile diseases have to be had in childhood.
And third?
Attention, recording is on.
Nothing serious. You must marry.
Parting with chicks. Take 1.
What girl?
Girls, your part.
If only with Betty...
What Betty, are you crazy? Betty..
Fire in the eyes, pull in your stomachs and bottoms...
Marry the daughter of academician Kupriyanov.
She likes you from a child.
Give mó more emotions and feelings.
Though, we live good with your mother..
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
My sweetheart! Leaving here - say godbay.
I used to love you selflessly.
You showed me the new world, the new Paradise,
And you're leaving it unnoticeable now.
You're going to be a Soviet, common diplomat.
As if you've forgotten your past,
But we're still waiting for you, brother,
At heart you're dandy, the same as before.
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
Even if your luxury shoes are already dumped,
Even if the "Quiff" doesn't sparkle anymore with brilliantine,
I not gonna shed a single tear.
Goodbye, my dear,
My darling!
Your choice is so clear. Go ahead, dude!
Follow your father to the highway,
It's a pity that you're leaving like this,
I'm sorry, but we're different, different a bit.
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
You'll be able to take a lot in return
From lavish gal, that's called Life.
But you'll never feel free again.
And your stylish youth will scarcely come back.
He doesn't need an american wife!
He doesn't need an american wife!
Let's start.
Sit down, comrades, we are going to start.
The agenda today is  the comrade Biryukov's couse.
Mels, stand up!
He was a Soviet student Mels...
And now we can see...
Dandy Mel!
Just one sign, right? It's nothing.
But let's remember.
What does the name "Mels" mean?
This is an abbreviation of the sacred names.
Marks...
Engels...
Lenin...
Stalin...
Now let's realize...
What does it mean to miss the sign "s"?
He used to live among us, we were stepping side by side.
He was an honest guy, a simple hero,
But the truth can't be hidden, this day has come,
He reveals his bared teeth,
He reveals his bared teeth,
Bounded with one chain,
Connected with one aim.
Bounded with one chain,
Connected with one..
How dare you infringe the holy of holies,
Where are your ideals, did you spit at them?!
You're selling yourself to the enemy for the bright clothes,
And easily parting with conscience and honour.
But you're not gonna win, our chain'll not be broken.
Bounded with one chain,
Connected with one aim.
You dare not dance to the music of Fatties,
Dare not wriggle and not betray us,
The guy like you shouldn't be near us,
When we are stepping in order,
Our  party for us is like mother and the komsomol like a father.
Hey, you, don't move! Well done,good boy!
We're not gonna dance to somebody's tune.
Our joyful bugle is playing us the reveille.
Bounded with one chain,
Connected with one aim.
There is no place for such mean men and bastards,
Here our own ideals are left to descendants,
Men sing here in chorus, rowing with stream,
Men walk here abreast, loving the unity,
And we are happy the same to go without you,
And to be!
Bounded with one chain,
Connected with one aim.
Are you going somewhere?
I have a bad news, Mel.
And I have too.
I have a really bad news.
And I have a bad one. What's your's?
I'm leaving, and we break down.
And what do you have?
So I have...
just little difficultes.
Polina, what's wrong?
Why do you keep silent?
You can't decide it by yourself!
You can't decide it for both of us!
You even can't decide this alone!
I`m pregnant, Mel!
That's great, Polly.
So we'll have a baby.
It's not your baby, Mel.
This is my baby.
Mine.
This is my baby!
Also my mother turned me out of home.
So
That's a good thing.
Maybe now you gonna calm down.
How they say it...
Minus and minus, and we have a good family
What are you standing like thunderstrucked?
Heard everything?
I'll have a nephew soon.
Move the beds now.
I feel strange...
that we shouldn't hide.
Yeah.
Polly...
What?
How do you think?
Will we hurt him?

Mister, please don't turn us out of doors.
We're not gonna sing so loud anymore.
We're not gonna drink, swear dirtily and smoke.
But if you want to do this by your own,
please, don't invite us.
We're saying goodbye to him today..
I thought, that we had at least 5 years in reserve.
I was so sure, that we had enough time to drink beer and talk.
But I just see your back,
with the stencil "Don't miss me".
Wait, stay for one more day.
Shalyaj-Valyaj.
Goodbye, my friend
Shalyaj-Valyaj.
You're leaving so suddenly
Shalyaj-Valyaj.
You're leaving without saying goodbye.
You're leaving unexpectedly.
Well, goodbye, my friend.
Shalyaj-Valyaj.
You know, all is not so bad.
This style defeats the fear.
This amazing evil absurd epoch
din't turn us to dust.
Let's keep these faces in mind.
And a sharp edge of a vinyl.
And may Love save us.
Shalyaj-Valyaj.
