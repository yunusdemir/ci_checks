DENMARK, MAY 1945
Five years of German occupation just ended.
You there, stand still.
You!
What's that? It's not yours.
Understood?
What are you looking at?
Do you have a problem?
Do you? Then go home!
Piss off!
This isn't your flag.
Please, please stop!
Move. Get up!
Get up, I said.
Here. Take your cap.
Get lost.
Get lost!
Run!
I said run!
This is my country.
Understood? Get out!
You're not welcome here.
Get lost!
My country! Understood?
- Get them out of here!
- Yes, Sergeant.
LAND OF MINE
<i>I'm Captain Ebbe Jensen
from the Danish Pioneer Corps.</i>
For all those who don't know
why they're here,
you've been brought to Denmark
to clean up after the war.
<i>Denmark is not your friend.
Make sure you understand that.</i>
Don't expect the Danish people
to welcome you with open arms.
No one wants to see Germans here.
You only serve one purpose for us.
To clear Denmark's west coast
of German landmines.
Mines that you brought here.
Approximately 2.2 million landmines are
buried along the Danish west coast.
That's more than
in all the other European countries.
Someone must have thought that
the Allied invasion would take place here.
What a disgrace for those
who came up with the idea.
And what a shame for you.
Who among you has seen
or handled a landmine before?
And who among you has tried
to defuse one?
Who has seen one like this before?
These are the most common mines.
To achieve maximum effect,
these mines are buried
15 to 20 centimeters deep in the sand.
This makes them relatively easy to find.
You just lost your hands.
Go on.
We don't have any time for self-pity.
You're dead.
I think we have
our first fatal injury here.
Don't you want to see your family again?
Do you really want
to be the first to die?
- No.
- "No"? I don't understand you.
- No, sir. I won't be the first to die.
- Nice to hear that. Try again.
Dead again.
These mines are not dummies.
That means
that if you make a mistake,
you'll either die or be badly injured.
- Have I made myself clear?
- Yes, Captain.
Good.
You, come here.
- You'll go first.
- Yes, Captain.
Carry on.
Next.
Well done.
You were fast.
Next.
Faster!
Next.
Well done.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Next.
Very good.
Faster!
Come on!
The others would already
have defused all the mines by now.
Are you sleeping in there?
Captain, permission to enter
the bunker and bring him out?
Under no circumstances.
Fuck me.
I'm coming in.
- Let go of the mine.
- I can do it.
- Get up. Soldier, get up.
- No, I can do it.
- Soldier, get up!
- I want to do it. I have to, please.
Cover your ears.
Next.
When you have defused all the mines...
Elisabeth, come here, darling.
Are you soldiers?
Answer me, you filthy swine.
Are you soldiers?
Yes, Sergeant!
Line up!
Single file! Fast!
On the double!
Fall into rank.
On the double!
Attention!
- Don't you understand "attention"?
- I do, sir...
Then stand like a man!
At ease.
- Name.
- Marklein, Sergeant.
- First name.
- Hermann, Sergeant.
- Rodolf Selke, Sergeant.
- Friedrich Schnurr.
- Wolff what?
- Johann Wolff.
- Kluger, Sergeant.
- First name!
August Kluger, Sergeant.
And you two.
You look like brothers.
- Yes, twins, Sergeant.
- Oh, really.
- Name?
- Werner and Ernst Lessner, Sergeant.
- Did I ask you?
- No, Sergeant.
Then shut up.
- I'm sorry.
- What?
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry, Sergeant.
- What are you sorry for?
- For mentioning my brother's name, sir.
- You're sorry?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Shut up and don't give me "sorry"!
I don't need it. Got it?
Yes, Sergeant.
- And you, little one?
- Wilhelm Lebern, Sergeant.
- Are you a soldier?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Ludwig Haffke, Sergeant.
- Sebastian Schumann, Sergeant.
- Look at me when you address me.
- Helmut Morbach, Sergeant.
- Nice uniform you have there.
- Were you in the war?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Are you crying?
- No, Sergeant.
- What's wrong? Are you crying?
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you afraid?
- No, Sergeant.
- Are you homesick?
- No, Sergeant.
Can you all see
the black flag down there?
Yes, Sergeant.
<i>Between the black flag and the trail
45,000 mines are buried.</i>
You will defuse all of them.
<i>When you're finished,
you're free to go home.</i>
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
<i>Only then can you go home.
Understood?</i>
<i>Yes, Sergeant.</i>
<i>Assuming you defuse six mines an hour
and don't blow yourself up,</i>
<i>you'll be home in three months.</i>
- Is that understood?
- Yes, Sergeant.
You.
- Do you have something to say?
- No, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure, Sergeant.
- You there, with the map.
- Ludwig, Sergeant.
Give me the map.
- Can you all see this?
- Yes, sir.
Each zone has a number.
The stars and the points indicate
what types of mines they are.
Those of you counting the mines
must ensure
that the mine maps are always updated.
This task is just as important
as defusing the mines.
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.
From the rock to the marking
by the water, we'll make a security zone.
Need I mention what will happen
to anyone who attempts to flee?
No, Sergeant!
One, two, three, four.
One, two,
three, four.
One, two, three, four.
I have one.
I have one.
I have one!
Me too!
It's not all that bad,
this whole thing.
What will you all do when you get home?
I'm going to be a mechanic.
A good friend of my father
has a nice factory.
He'll hire me as soon as I get back.
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- Stay out of it.
Why? He should know his "nice" future
is just a shitty illusion.
It's not an illusion. It's the truth.
He already promised me.
- And what if...
- Shut up.
If you like, I can ask him
if he'd hire another apprentice.
Of course.
That would be great.
- Sure. We could work together.
- Yeah.
Say, Wilhelm.
Can you ask for me, too?
- Lay off.
- That would be swell.
- All three of us...
- Helmut.
- Shut your mouth.
- Lay off.
All of us, hand in hand.
What?
I think she has something to eat.
She's eating bread.
Hello there.
What's her name?
Do you understand German?
She hurt herself.
Look.
A soldier should always
be prepared to help.
When I was a little kid, I didn't have
a doll. I'm a boy, so I had a toy car.
That's much better.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
Elisabeth.
- Elisabeth.
- I think you have to go.
Elisabeth, come here!
What are you doing over there?
No! Listen to me!
I told you to stay away
from the Germans.
What don't you understand?
Don't you understand me? I'm tired
of you drifting about all the time.
If anyone has to piss,
do it now.
No? Off to bed.
March!
On the double.
- Everyone here?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Can't you talk to him?
- I'm hungry. I haven't eaten in days.
- No point in complaining.
How am I supposed to defuse mines
without food?
- It's me, Sebastian.
- What do you want?
I just wondered if you'd heard
when we'll get something to eat.
- I think if we don't get any food...
- What do you think?
Do you think I feel sorry for you?
- No, sir.
- I don't give a shit about any of you.
- I don't care if you croak.
- I know, Sergeant.
I don't know when the food arrives.
Germans aren't first in line.
Good night, Sebastian.
Off to bed.
You there, go to sleep!
Into your beds!
- Where are you going?
- Go to sleep.
- Are you running away?
- I'm going to find something to eat.
Honestly, Sergeant.
He can't work. I know my brother.
I watched him all morning.
He couldn't stop vomiting.
Look at me when you speak to me.
- Ernst?
- It's true, Sergeant. I...
- You, too. Look at me.
- It's true, Sergeant. I'm really ill.
If I could just lie down for an hour,
please.
Ernst, you know I can't allow that.
- Sergeant, I am very ill.
- Please, Sergeant.
You're a bit hot, that's all.
You'll be able to work, right?
Sergeant...
What do you think, Otto?
Should we let him rest
for an hour, huh?
We could.
Do you think they're faking it?
No, they wouldn't dare.
Would they? No.
Boys, look at me.
- Back to work.
- Please...
Didn't I make myself clear?
Back to work, I said! Now!
On the double!
Wilhelm? Wilhelm?
Something's wrong.
Take off my helmet.
Take off the damn helmet.
Help me!
- I want to go home.
- Just calm down.
Everything will be fine.
Helmut, I need your help!
We have to carry him off the beach.
- Help me.
- You'll be fine. Just calm down.
Calm down.
- For God's sake, help me!
- What's wrong with you? Help him!
Help me!
- I want to go home.
- You'll be fine.
Help me.
- Help me!
- It's okay.
- Help me!
- Sergeant! We need your help!
- I want to go home!
- Look at me.
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Hold him steady.
- Mom! Mom!
- Sergeant, please come!
Please do something!
Please help us!
Sergeant, please come!
- Please, Sergeant!
- Mom!
Mom! I want to go home!
Look at me. You'll go back home.
Everything will be fine.
Trust me.
I can't go on.
I want to go home.
I want... I want...
Thank you, Sergeant.
- What happened here?
- It was my mistake, Sergeant.
- Your "mistake"?
- It's my fault, Sergeant. We were...
- Look at me when you speak to me.
- We were all so hungry last night.
I stole some feed in the barn. I'm sure
that's what made everyone so sick.
As an officer, I'm responsible for them.
For getting them food.
You don't have
any responsibilities here.
Where's your mom?
When I say there's nothing edible
in here, there isn't.
What's this?
If they ate this, no wonder
they're sick. It's full of rat poop.
- What's so funny?
- I got some Germans after all.
- Why did she laugh?
- Listen to me, boy.
We don't talk to one another.
Understood?
You're not to address me.
I ask a question. You answer.
- Always with "Sergeant. " Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Why didn't you eat anything?
- He didn't offer me any, Sergeant.
Surrender yourselves!
Drink, drink, drink!
Get it out.
- Water, water.
- Do you want to die?
Good job, boys.
Keep drinking.
Wash up.
Wash up.
Head down.
Wash up. Good.
Head down.
Good boy, come here.
Sit.
Go to bed.
I want to show you something, Sergeant.
- Go to bed.
- Let me show you something, Sergeant.
This frame will make
clearing the mines much easier.
It frames the area,
where we're searching for the mines.
Good job.
I get it. I'm not stupid.
- I know you're not stupid.
- Good. Take your toy and go to bed.
I know you hate us, sir.
I know you don't care
if we're ripped apart by mines, sir.
- Or if we starve.
- Yes. You're right.
Sir, isn't it better for you if we die
down at the beach, searching for mines?
I don't care, boy.
Take your toy and go to bed.
The beach must be cleared of mines.
Right, Sergeant?
That you understand. What don't you
understand about going to bed?
I understand that, but please listen.
- Hurry up.
- Do you understand me?
Do I understand you?
Do you understand me?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Good. Take your toy and go to bed.
Now!
Good night, Sergeant.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Wilhelm Lebern.
- Yes.
He came in a couple of days ago.
Wilhelm died yesterday.
He's still here
if you want to see him.
No.
That won't be necessary.
Thank you.
Time to get up, boys.
Get up.
Get up.
Line up.
At ease.
I have some good news
and some bad news.
The good news is
that I just visited Wilhelm.
He's doing better.
They're taking good care of him.
And he'll survive.
He sends his greetings to you all.
He'll be home soon.
The bad news is
that we're behind schedule.
This week,
you have to defuse eight mines an hour.
- Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- I can't hear you. Understood?
- Yes, Sergeant!
Good.
We'll move out in 10 minutes.
Eat up.
The first thing I'll do when I get home
is get me a beer and a girl.
- Do you have a girlfriend back home?
- No, but it's the first thing I'll do.
- Don't you want to see your parents?
- They'll have to wait.
What will you two do?
- Get a job and get rich. Right, Werner?
- That's right, my friend.
- What kind of job?
- Bricklayer, of course.
Everything's in ruins and has
to be rebuilt. That's where we come in.
- "Werner, Ernst and Sons. "
- "And Sons"?
When we have sons, they'll take over.
And it sounds a lot bigger if
we call the firm "... and Sons. "
We'll be the owners. No one will notice
that the sons don't exist.
Clever. Maybe I should do the same.
"Ludwig and Sons. " Sounds good, right?
Yeah. Almost as good
as "Werner, Ernst and Sons. "
Shit, this is heavy.
I told you to be careful!
- How many AT mines do we have?
- Forty-four, Sergeant.
- Count again.
- Two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve.
Fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty,
twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-six...
- Forty-four, Sergeant.
- And the S-mines?
- Sixteen, Sergeant.
- Count them again.
- What's his name?
- Benny. His name is Benny.
Benny, Benny, Benny.
- No, he should be called Timmy.
- No.
- Because of his coloring.
- How does that relate to "black"?
It sounds black, somehow.
"Benny" is better.
He's called...
Tim Benny.
"Tim" is his first name.
- "Benny" is his first name.
- No.
No, my friend.
Come here, Tim Benny.
Look at that purple coloring.
A beautiful animal.
- What's this insect called, anyway?
- A six-footer.
- A bark beetle.
- No.
Benny Tim, the bark beetle.
- Benny Tim, the six-footed bark beetle.
- Yeah.
Benny Tim, the six-footed bark beetle.
Go on, boys. Off to bed.
Sebastian.
Leave your sticks here.
- Everyone present?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Look out below!
Look at him.
Open your mouth.
- Yeah, mouth open.
- Stop!
Stop it!
Open your mouth. Open your mouth!
Stop it! Stop it!
Shoot the bastard!
Look at me!
Look at me!
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
- Please, please.
- Look at me.
I need these boys.
Who the fuck are you?
I'm Sergeant Carl Leopol Rasmussen.
This is my unit.
My assignment is to clean the beach.
I need these boys.
I need all of them.
Go inside, boys.
Come, Ludwig.
Ludwig.
Go and wash yourself.
Hey!
This is unacceptable, Ebbe.
I just got them motivated.
Know what is unacceptable? Rumors
of you getting food for the Germans.
I got it for myself and my dog.
People are talking,
and it pisses them off.
- Sure it's not you being pissed off?
- No. But why do you need more food?
We pay the farm good money
to provide for you.
- Do you hear me?
- Yes...
So look at me
when I speak to you!
You should have told me
that I was getting little boys, Ebbe.
- It changes the situation somewhat.
- I don't think so.
If you're old enough to go to war,
you're old enough to clean up your mess.
- These boys haven't got a clue.
- No?
So fill them in, Carl.
That's your job.
You're not beginning to like them,
are you?
No.
Remember what they did.
Rather them than us.
Just help me get some older
and more experienced men.
Shit.
Ludwig, stop!
Ludwig! There are two mines
on top of one another!
Stop working! There are two mines
on top of one another!
Werner!
Stop working!
Now I've got you, you little bastard.
Werner!
Stop working!
Werner!
Werner, where are you?
Werner!
Werner!
Werner, where are you?
- Werner! Werner?
- Ernst, sit down.
Werner, where are you?
Say something.
- Werner, where are you?
- Ernst, calm down.
- Let me get out there!
- Calm down.
We have to find him.
- Let me go.
- Hold him tight.
Werner!
Hold him. Tight.
Calm down.
Calm down, boy.
Good.
Outside, boys.
Sebastian, outside.
You have to sleep now.
- No, calm down.
- We have to look for Werner.
We'll look for Werner tomorrow.
You have to sleep now.
- Come on.
- No. I want to find Werner first.
We have to go to the beach. I wanted
to save him, but he ran away.
We have to find him now.
He sleeps up there
and I can't fall asleep without him.
- Come on.
- No. You have to sleep.
We'll look for him tomorrow.
"Tomorrow"?
Tomorrow's good.
When we find Werner,
I'll go to Germany with him
and we'll rebuild everything.
I'll rebuild everything.
Because everything's rubble there.
Everything has to be rebuilt.
Bricklayers... We're bricklayers.
That's a good job.
Sergeant...
Please don't hate him.
I don't.
- Please don't hate him.
- I don't.
No, lie down.
Rest now. You have to sleep.
If you knew him as well as I do,
you'd definitely help.
I lied to you.
Wilhelm didn't survive.
I know, Sergeant.
It's better like that, Sergeant.
Not knowing meant
we could keep clearing mines.
So that we'll be able
to go home one day.
Perhaps.
It's okay.
I won't take it.
Does the cross help you?
- Give it a try, Sergeant.
- No.
Go on, Sergeant.
Give it a try.
- No.
- I mean it, Sergeant. Try it.
My father gave it to me.
He always did that to me.
He gave me a shock every time.
That's why I wear it.
Is your father still alive?
I don't know.
<i>- Sebastian.
- Hermann.</i>
- Rodolf.
- August.
- Johann.
- Johann.
- Come on, Friedrich.
- Helmut, you're on our team.
- We'll take this end.
- Let's go.
Good, Helmut!
That's it!
Stop! Over here!
Shoot!
- Come on, boys!
- No!
- August!
- Help me, will you?
Not again, you idiot.
This is football, not handball.
On the ground, please.
Ludwig, come here!
Let's keep playing.
- Who's that?
- Some new guys.
Hello.
We're supposed to join your unit.
Where is Sergeant Rasmussen?
That's him. But you can register
with me. I'm Ludwig.
- Gustav Becker.
- Albert Brauer.
Join us.
Today is our day off.
What's your name?
Just tell me.
Keep calm.
Don't run away now.
That's better.
One, two, three. Go!
Morbach broke the world record!
See this?
The first goal was amazing.
- Next time we'll win.
- Here! Come.
- You think so.
- It's true.
Here, Otto.
Come on.
- Come on.
- The water was great.
- The dunes are beautiful.
- Yeah, you should explore them.
Soldier Ludwig Haffke. You were
responsible for Zone 7, correct?
Affirmative, sir.
I kept tabs on everything.
Twelve-hundred mines were buried,
1,200 were found, defused and recorded, sir.
- But you miscounted, didn't you?
- No, sir. I recounted to be sure.
Twelve-hundred mines were buried,
1,200 mines were removed.
Fetch the ball.
Fetch the ball!
Like a dog!
With your mouth!
Good doggy.
Very good.
Fetch the ball. Hurry!
No hands! Just your mouth!
Good doggy.
Good doggy.
Nice doggy.
Good doggy-.
Sit!
Bark.
- Bark!
- Woof, Sergeant.
- What?
- Woof.
Louder.
Bark!
Louder!
Do you want to say something?
Want to say something?
Want to say something, huh?
- Maybe the...
- Sergeant, please stop.
Idiot!
You're all idiots!
I've got a load of German fools!
Do you hear? Every last one of you!
How can I guarantee
that the beach is safe?
- Tell me that!
- Sergeant.
We can recount them
to check if the numbers are right.
"To check if the numbers are right"?
What good are the numbers now, huh?
Tell me what good they'll do.
Huh?
- Can you guarantee this beach is safe?
- No, Sergeant.
Then shut your goddamn mouth!
I was too nice to you all.
That's the problem here.
And you took advantage of it!
From now on,
you'll all go together.
Arm in arm.
Side by side.
Through all the cleared areas.
I have to ensure
that no mistakes are made.
Trusting you was my mistake.
But that's over now.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Sergeant.
I told you so.
He may as well line us up and shoot us.
Do you have something to say, soldier?
Are you laughing?
Are you laughing?
Do you think I'm funny?
Do you find me amusing?
Are you laughing, soldier?
- No, Sergeant!
- Why are you laughing then?
Why are you laughing?
- Are you a man?
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Are you a soldier?
- Yes, Sergeant.
Then behave like a soldier!
Is that clear?
Yes, Sergeant!
- Do you still find me funny?
- No, Sergeant!
Then pull yourself together!
Behave like a man.
Does anyone else have anything to say?
Then say it now.
Does anyone else have anything to say?
All right, then.
Forward march!
On the double!
Forward march!
Through all the cleared areas.
Inch by inch!
Until we're absolutely certain!
I say we bolt before we all die.
Are you deaf?
Are you just going to take this?
I'd rather let the Brits shoot me
than do that again.
We're staying until the work's done.
Then we'll go home.
The Sergeant said
we could go home when we're done.
The Sergeant? And do you think
the Sergeant will keep his word?
If you want to continue
that death march, then please do.
But you can't tell me what to do.
No one can!
And what will happen to us
when he sees you're gone?
- I can't let you do that.
- That is not your decision!
- I'm getting out of here!
- You're staying put!
You still don't get it, huh? He hates you
just like he hates the rest of us.
Is our friendly Sergeant doing this
because he's so fond of us?
Grab him!
Tie him down!
- I said tie him down!
- Let go!
You damn traitors!
Untie me!
Untie me!
Will you be quiet?
Will you be quiet?
Carl! Carl!
Hurry!
Where's the Sergeant?
Help! Help! Help!
My... My little girl...
Help me!
Please help me!
- My little girl!
- Okay.
Elisabeth!
Elisabeth!
You have to sit down, dear,
and wait for help.
Wake up!
Ernst, where are the others?
Wake up, boy!
Hey! Where are the others?
Did they take off?
No, sit down.
Sit down.
Sit still, dear. One of the boys
is coming to get you.
Ernst!
Ernst!
Hello there.
Is she hurt again?
Ouch?
Ouch?
Do you know Werner?
He's a good brother.
He looks exactly like me.
I'd do anything for him.
Everything's fine.
Ernst, please hand her over to me.
Coming, Ernst?
- Ernst, please come here.
- Ernst, come here.
Ernst, come here!
- Ernst.
- What are you doing? Come here!
Ernst, come back.
Ernst, please come.
- What are you doing?
- Come on.
Wipe away those tears.
- Repeat after me. "It's almost over. "
- It's almost over.
- "I'll make it home. "
- I'll make it home.
Yes.
- Okay?
- Yes.
Stop crying.
I need you.
The others need you. Okay?
- You must be strong. Can you do that?
- Yes.
- I can be strong.
- You are strong.
- I am strong.
- Say it again.
- I am strong.
- Yes. "I'll make it home. "
I'll make it home.
It's almost over.
Thanks.
- Gustav?
- Yeah?
What are you going to do
when you get home?
Eat. I'm just going to eat.
My mother's the best cook in Berlin.
I'm so sick of this Danish chow.
I'll visit you.
Yes, just stop by
Oranienburger Strasse in Berlin.
- Visit me.
- Potatoes, meat and sauce.
- The best.
- Always.
Damn!
Let's go.
- Sit down.
- What do you want?
<i>We need experienced men at Skallingen.</i>
- Sure, but I'm going to Ringkřbing.
- Indeed. I didn't mean you.
<i>Who then?</i>
Your German boys.
<i>We need them there.
People are dying like flies.</i>
The mines have shifted, so it's chaos.
We need experienced Germans.
I'd like to help,
but I've already sent them home.
So I heard.
Four out of 14 survived.
But they aren't going home, Carl.
<i>What?</i>
<i>I promised them they could go home
when we were done, and we are done.</i>
<i>All Germans in the country must stay
until all the mines are cleared. All!</i>
Ebbe...
I'm asking you to send those boys home.
Please let them go.
They'll die down there.
I understand you, Carl.
- But the order has been carried out.
- We're talking about four boys.
Now you listen to me!
If I hear more about those boys,
I'll go down and shoot them myself.
They're no good. You have no idea
what they have on their conscience.
You've been lying to me from day one!
They're little boys, Ebbe.
Little boys who cry out for their mom
when they get scared
or have a limb blown off.
They're Germans, Carl.
The order has been carried out.
You know the way out?
- Bye for now, Carl.
- You shut up!
Ebbe...
That will be all, Carl.
<i>We believe</i>
that approximately 72,000
German mines
are buried here at Skallingen.
Some of you had the luxury
of doing your work with the assistance
of detailed mine maps.
Here at Skallingen
we do not have any such maps.

- Yes, sir.

Get in. On the double.
Get in already.
Everyone out.
Come on. Out.
That way.
The border is about 500 meters away.
Then you'll be in Germany.
Run.
Run!
After the war more than 2,000
German POW's were forced
to remove over 1.5 million landmines
from the west coast of Denmark.
Almost half of them died
or were severely injured.
Many of them were just young boys.
