I took your advice.
It was good advice, thank you.
You're pale, everything ok?
Shawn. Shawn!
Hey!
Anyway listen I wanted to tell you,
the only reason why I canceled…
Oh, he's calling me 3 times a day.
I hear more from him now,
than I did when we were together.
What is it with guys?
<i>I gave notice.
–Ticket. –Notice? -</i>
<i>–May I see your ticket?
–I… uh…</i>
Hey
You're acting a little strange
this morning, are you ok?
Are we gonna make up
the 10 Minutes?
We gonna try, Sir.
Hey, grandpa, what the heck
was they delay back there?
–I just punch the tickets, Sir.
–You should punch your face…
Shawn, did I do something?
Look, I can see that you think you know
me but I don't know who you are…
My name is Captain Colter Stevens.
I fly helicopters for the US Army
in Afghanistan.
–Shawn, that's…
–Shawn?
I feel sick.
<i>–Dammit!
–Sorry! Let me help with that…</i>
No, it's ok.
Hey Mister! Hey!
–Hey, you dropped this!
–Thanks!
–What is that?
–Chicago.
<i>“All aboard, doors are closing”.</i>
–“This is the Chicago-down train”
–You okay there, Captain?
Did you see that?
You kinda freaking me out.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no…
–Are you alright?
–I don't know, what's going on…
Talk to me Shawn!
Look, I don't know who Shawn is,
and I don't know who you are!
Okay, we get off at the next stop
and forget whatever is going on here, ok?
This doesn't belong to me.
Look at me,
everything is gonna be okay!
<i>Captain Colter Stevens,
this is Beleaguered Castle.</i>
<i>Captain Colter Stevens, this is Beleaguered
Castle, acknowledge transmission.</i>
<i>Captain Stevens, do you copy?</i>
Where am I?
<i>You're with “Beleaguered Castle”
Are you functional?</i>
I'm dizzy.
Did I… did I stay locked?
<i>Adjusting your rotation.</i>
<i>Can you report at this time?</i>
Fuck this?
What is this?
Where…
Who am I talking to?
<i>Captain report what you saw.</i>
<i>What, I don't understand it.</i>
Where were you
before you were talking to me?
<i>–There was an explosion.
–Coming from where?</i>
<i>Some confusion is perfectly
normal at this stage, Captain.</i>
<i>Do you have a visual signal?</i>
Who are you?
You already have that
information, Captain.
–I do?
–Recall my name.
We'll rebuild the pattern.
Try to focus.
I… I was on a mission…
I was flying… and…
then I woke up on a train.
Now I'm here.
I need to be briefed.
Uh… what… what unit is this?
You're with Beleaguered Castle.
–Who? —
Stand by for thread 1
of alpha memory pattern.
Wha… what…
what is “beleaguered castle?”
The exercises will assist you.
Memory thread 1.
Listen to the following message:
Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak.
–In her hand were 5 playing cards
–Is this a joke?
They were the Queen of Spades,
Four of Clubs…
Nine of Clubs,
Three of Hearts, Nine of Hearts
Is this a red flag exercise?
End of thread 1. Thread 2: the following
is a recording of a western screetch-owl.
End of thread 2. End of pattern.
Acknowledge.
Acknowledge end of pattern.
Stand by to initiate pattern recall?
Go for pattern recall.
Arrange the 5 playing cards…
in order of descending value
irrespective of the suit.
–Queen, two nines, four and a three.
–That is correct.
The passage I read contained mention
of a woman's name. What was that name?
Her name is Lilly.
That's correct
Recall my name.
Goodwin, your name's Goodwin.
That is correct.
Welcome back, Captain.
Ma'am, I need…
need to talk to my father.
Has anybody been notified
that I am stateside?
Who bombed the train, Captain?
–What?
–Who bombed the train?
–A woman kept calling me “Shawn”.
–That is incidental.
Think Captain, remember back.
Who bombed the train?
I don't know
who bombed the God damned train.
–Then go back and try again.
–Back where?
You will have 8 minutes,
same as last time.
No, no, no, no, no.
No more bullshit sim tests, okay?
I need to know, where I am, what is
the location and condition of my crew.
Does anybody know,
that I am stateside?
You're obligated to give me…
this information!
–Start with the bomb!
Where is it,
what does it look like.
–What kind of explosive,
–Right…
–…how is it detonated.
–Right.
Find the bomb
and you'll find the bomber.
Find the bomb…
Wait no, how…!
I took your advice.
It was good advice. Thank you.
Well, that's good.
And I signed for up for the
NALSAR course.
Next thing you know,
I'll be moving to India to find myself.
–Dont say that…
–Know any good Gurus?
Oh, she got your shoe…
So, what do you think?
Am I on the right track?
It's the same train but it's different.
Deep. I hope it's different.
I feel the same way.
What?
<i>–My hand… Brian… What is it with guys,
everything is more beautiful in retrospect.</i>
This looks so real.
You know, I think it's gonna be
really good for me…
to get as far away from him
as possible.
<i>–Unbelievable detail.
–Ticket.</i>
May I see your ticket?
Thanks.
They wouldn't put the doer
in front of me.
The doer?
You are the pretty girl.
The distraction.
–“Distraction”?
–Every sim has one.
Hey, are we gonna make up
the ten minute?
We are gonna try.
–Are you talking about Brian?
–Hey, Grandpa…
What the hell
was the delay back there?
–What're you late for?
–What?
You seem concerned about the time.
What're you late for?
I'm late to an asshole festival…
I hear you re headlining.
Oh, thats funny.
Who are you, a comedian?
Yeah, he is… a comedian.
Sit down, freak.
Fans…
Thats the guy.
He came in 3rd on America's
Got Talent. Got sided twice for DUI.
–We talked about him.
–Thank you, ma'am, thank you.
<i>–You're welcome.
–“Glenbrook station”.</i>
Yeah, but at 1 o'clock
the bridge is gonna be jammed.
–Damn it!
–Ah, I'm sorry.
Hey Mr… hey!
–You dropped this.
–Ah, thanks.
<i>“All aboard, doors are closing”.</i>
The explosion came from behind me.
What's with you?
I don't have time
to talk to you right now.
I got time for you.
<i>Next stop,
Chicago, Union Station”.</i>
Oh, shit!
Goodwin, you gonna tell me
how to disarm this?
Uh… should I… unplug it?
Or do you want me to just leave it?
Or…
Okay, uhm…
I am just gonna leave it.
Okay?
Ladies and Gentleman,
Transit Security.
–You're not.
–Due to a classified security-breach…
I need all of you turn off…
your personal electronic devices
till we pull into the station, okay?
That means laptops, cellphones.
Cellphone, Sir!
Cellphone, Sir!
Thank your very much.
Pagers, anything electronic. Thank you.
It's a precautionary measure,
it's nothing to worry about.
So which is it, security breach
or precautionary measure?
Sir! Sir.
–Is there a problem here, Sir?
–I'm in the middle of a very big deal…
–Shawn?
–I need you to turn that off.
Why don't you show me that ID again?
–Shawn!
–Turn it off! Turn it off.
What's your problem, asshole?
–Hey!
–Oh, my God…
Shawn, what're you doing?
–Hey, not a good idea, ma'am.
–Not a good idea.
–Ooh, that's not a good idea.
–I think you broke his jaw.
It's okay, he is not any more real
than you are.
I'm not real?
How about next time you drive to work!
There's not gonna be a next time.
Stabilize.
Lower your pulse.
–Did you find the bomb?
–Yes…
There's hydraulic fluid
all over the floor.
That is not a concern, Captain.
–What is…?
–Tell me about the bomb.
Where's that man?
I saw a guy with a crutch on the monitor.
He looks like he's in charge,
I wanna talk to him.
That's irrelevant, Captain.
I wanna talk to your
commanding officer!
You can talk to him
upon completion of your mission.
My mission is in Afghanistan,
where my unit is.
I flew two goddamn sorties
yesterday.
You've been with us for 2 months.
–Did you ID the bomber?
–No, where is my unit?
And under who's jurisdiction
is this simulation?
Captain, this is not a simulation.
Lives are depending on you.
What lives?
What do you remember about the bomb?
Tell me about the detonator.
No, no, what lives?
What're you talking about?
I need to be briefed!
–Sir, I… I need to give him something.
–That's fine, go ahead.
Get ready to send him back in.
At 7:48 this morning
Central Standart Time,
a bomb exploded on a commuter train
outside of Chicago,
killing everyone on board.
And thats the train
that you've been on.
No, no, I'm right here,
you're talking to me right now!
A man named Shawn Fentress
was on that train.
He… for all intents and purposes,
is now… you.
Every second spent explaining things
puts more innocent civilians at risk.
This makes no sense.
The train explosion was the first attack
of a series. There are going to be more.
Now, did you find the bomb?
In the restroom,
ventilation panel above the sink.
Cellphone detonator.
Are we done⁈
Uh… no, no. But that's good,
that's very very good, Captain. Good.
Our record show that 1812 calls
ended at the moment of the explosion.
52 of those calls were tethered
to the cell tower nearest the train.
So, one of those calls
was made by our bomber.
Do you remember a freight train
passing by just before the explosion?
Yes.
The explosion was timed to engulf
the passing freight train which means,
the bomber had to be watching
both trains when the call was made.
52 callers,
one of those is our bomber.
I want you to concentrate
on the passengers in your car.
Get to know them,
narrow the suspect pool.
Look for ones who seem… quiet
or withdrawn, who seem nervous.
As always, you'll have 8 minutes.
8 minutes, and I blow up again?
Yes.
I need you to discipline yourself
on this next pass.
Perform only the task that we assign you.
Everything else is irrelevant.
Charge the drivers.
Is my father even…
I took your advice…
It was very good advice.
–You're kinda quiet today.
–Just got a lot on my mind. Careful.
Yikes.
–Oh, so sorry.
–Don't worry about it.
That's very kind of you.
You're very decent.
Thank you.
–And real.
–Ticket.
–How's everything today?
–It's good.
–Anything outta the ordinary?
–Mmm… no.
I mean behavior on the train.
Is anything… anybody seems strange to you?
You look strange.
How about you,
does anybody looks suspicious?
–Are you drunk or something?
–Come here. Just for a second.
Come on.
–Just think of it as a game.
–A game?
Wow… They're all…
they're all so utterly… normal, Shawn.
That's what so terrifying about them.
Maybe there's a team network.
The sleeping giant coached with
the minister and them out there.
Don't forget the sullen college kid,
he's the expendable one.
I bet they're all controlled
by the conductor.
Standing there
dictatorial demanding tickets.
–You're funny.
–Damn it.
–What about that guy?
–Deposition.
About the woman
sitting across from him?
Hair appointment, every Monday,
you know this.
You talk to this people more
than I do.
Right, right. And the guy behind her?
He's late for an audition, right?
To recorded offenses…
That's the guy that was sided to SUD.
A DUI. I know.
Hey, how's the signal in here?
It's good.
Is teaching not stimulating enough
for you anymore, Sherlock?
Oh oh, now we slip to
the racial profiling, that is.
Did anyone else come outta
the bathroom over there?
–Well, I saw you coming outta there.
–Me?
–Yes.
–No…
<i>–Me?
–Hey Mister…</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
Hold on, hold on a second.
Just hold on a second.
It has to be something near.
Come on…
A broken phone.
–Christina?
–Yeah?
Excuse me.
–Hey, hey come with me.
–This isn't our stop!
–Oh, come on, let's take a walk.
–We don't get off here.
–I don't know, just be spontaneous.
–You kinda freaking me out…
I know this gonna sound really weird…
but I have a really bad feeling
about this train…
and I think
that we should get off, okay?
<i>–Just get your stuff.
–“All aboard. Doors are closing”.</i>
Come on, come with me.
–So what now?
–Wait, one second, I'll be right back!
Ready to get that coffee now?
Oh sorry, yeah, uh… just…
just one more second, okay?
Oh for God's sake.
Feel sick?
It's motion sickness,
I get it all the time.
Excuse me… Excuse me.
–Are you following me?
–Can I borrow your phone?
No, I don't have one.
–You sure?
–Yeah, I am sure.
Look, why you don't leave me
alone, please? Or I call the police.
With what? I thought you said
you didn't have a phone.
You know, you have no right…
What're you doing?
Give me my bag back.
Are you crazy?
–Shawn!
–Get back!
Shawn!…
What's going on?
Shawn!
Stop, Shawn!
–It wasn't you.
–What the hell's wrong with you?
–Are you insane?
–No!
No, no!
–Where is it?
–Get away from me!
–Where is it?
–Get away from me, please!
Shawn, Shawn, get up!
Shawn!
Shawn, listen to me, get up!
–Shawn!
–Give me your hand, get off the track…
–Mister, come on!
–Shawn, Shawn, get up…
Shawn, Shawn, get up…
Shawn!…
Goodwin?
Goodwin, come in,
do you read me?
Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,
do you copy? Please respond.
It's freezing in here,
whats going on?
What was that?
He's in trouble.
I think the oxygen just went out.
Goodwin?
Goodwin!
Find a way to get through to him.
What is it?
What's going on?
It's not the tertiary cooling ether.
Just keep sending strings out,
see if he hooks on to something.
It's hard to say exactly
what he's going through.
–Sir…
–Please!
It's not a whole lot
we can do from here.
If nothing changes,
how much time does he have?
Some…
not long.
<i>Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak,</i>
<i>in her hand were 5 playing cards…</i>
<i>The queen of spades</i>
Goodwin, you out there?
–Goodwin? Who's Goodwin?
–This is Captain Stevens, do you copy?
<i>Captain Stevens?</i>
The capsule lost power.
The capsule? Is that where you
are now, Captain, in a capsule?
–You should know, who are you?
–Let me get Captain Goodwin, get ready!
You invented this thing, right?
–I did.
–Wait, are you in command here?
I am. Were you able to locate the
information we need, Captain?
That's a negative Sir.
I was unable to find the bomber,
but I did save a…
a passenger on the train.
I got her off safely, a woman.
Captain, it's gonna be counterproductive
for you to try to save anyone…
on that train.
They're outside the mission.
Well, she survived.
And maybe the rest could too.
She survived, but only inside the
Source Code. None of them will be safe.
What is this Source Code?
It's quantum mechanics parable calculus.
It's very complicated.
Try me!
Fine.
When a light bulb's turned off,
there is an afterglow,
a lingering halo-like effect.
You seen it?
<i>–Yes
–Of course…</i>
The brain is like that,
its electromagnetic field remains charged,
just briefly even after death.
Circuits remain open.
<i>Now there is another peculiarity
about the brain.</i>
It contains a short-term memory track
that's approximately 8 minutes long…
like a convenience store's
security camera…
that only records the last portion
of the day's activity on its hard drive.
Now combining these 2 phenomena,
circuitry that remains viable…
postmortem and a memory bank
that goes back 8 Minutes…
Source Code enables us
to capitalize on the overlap.
Shawn Fentress died on that train,
of all the passengers aboard
he was your best link.
You two share the compatibility in terms of
gender, body size and your synaptic maps.
–What happens after the 8 minutes?
–After? Nothing.
You cease to exist on the train.
You cannot exist inside the Source Code,
beyond Fentress' 8 minutes.
Source Code is not…
time travel.
Rather,
Source Code is time reassignment.
It gives us access to a parallel reality. Now
the deaths on the train were a tragedy,
but Source Code empowers us…
–No, I… I saved…
one person, that girl,
that's always sitting across from me.
I pulled her off the train.
Give me her name.
Christina, I… I…
I don't remember her last name.
–Her name was Christina Warren.
–Yes!
<i>–She was 28.
–That's her…</i>
<i>Born in Moline, Illinois.
Died this morning on the train.</i>
No, I pulled her off.
She's fine.
–No, she isn't.
–Believe me, she is—
–Believe me.
–She saw me get hit by the express train.
<i>–This isn't getting us anywhere.
–No, no, no, wait, wait…</i>
We have to send him in.
A 2nd attack is imminent, Dr Rutledge.
–What second attack?
–The train was just the beginning…
–A letter of intent.
–I'm sorry, what are you telling me here?
We have information that
Downtown Chicago is the next target.
And they're planning
to detonate a dirty bomb.
You have any idea
how many people would die…
if an explosion of that magnitude
were to occur in the city?
We're evacuating as we speak.
We have to stop it before it happens,
do you understand?
If you find the bomber,
his second attack, the real attack,
we think, can be prevented.
We have very little time left.
Out here the clocks
only move in one direction.
Charge the drivers.
On the upper deck of the next carriage
there's a conductor's compartment.
It's a small office
containing a strongbox.
Inside is a loaded handgun.
Get to it. You're authorized
to use whatever force necessary.
I took your advice…
It was very good advice…
–You're still here.
–Of course I am…
Guess what?
You quit your job and you enrolled
in a NALSAR course.
Good guess.
Soda can.
Coffee spill.
Listen to me… don't answer it.
You deserve better than that guy.
Everything looks more beautiful
in retrospect, doesn't it?
How did you know it was him?…
–How well do you know me?
–Not that well apparently…
Do you know me well enough, that if I did
something that looked a little strange…
and was maybe even
a little bit dangerous…
and told you to trust me anyway,
that you could do that?
No.
Wow, that was honest.
You're beautiful, you're kind,
and you are painfully honest.
Who are you and what did you do
with Shawn Fentress?
It's the new me.
I don't wanna hurt you.
No, I am not gonna sit in my seat.
Alright, he's bleeding,
he needs medical attention.
Is it true that you tried to steal a gun
out of the train security box?
Careful ma'am!
–Dammit!
–What were you thinking? —
–Can I borrow your phone?
–No!
You need to go to the hospital, Shawn.
–Please,
–No, you need help… No!
–…please, can I borrow your…?
Why do you want my phone?
What would you do if you only had
one minute left to live?
I don't know.
I would call my dad.
I would hear his voice and…
I'd tell him I'm sorry.
Tell me everything is gonna be okay.
Everything is gonna be okay.
Oh yeah,
the gun in the strongbox,
that was a really great idea.
Thanks for that.
–Did you make any progress?
–Can I get access to a phone?
I need to talk to my father.
I will try to work on that soon.
Yes, I will try…
Goodwin, how am I doing?
Just trying to measure
my performance here.
You ever gotten back in?
Am I doing any better than you did?
No, we're wasting valuable time here.
No, no, I have never been on the
other side of a Source Code mission.
I wouldn't be a viable candidate.
Why not?
CAOC-N, what is that?…
Because the specifications
are extremely narrow.
What are they?
Captain, you should have found
the suspect by now.
This tactical advantage, this…
tremendous tool that we've given you…
Don't squander it thinking.
Do.
Please contact my father for me.
This will stop at some point, Captain.
As soon as you finish the mission.
And you're doing really great.
This will end.
Whoever planted the bomb
had to have equipment of some kind.
Gloves, a screwdriver to get into the
over head vent, flashlight, something.
Check bags, backpacks,
briefcases, anything.
So, I took your advice.
–It was very good advice.
–Hey Grandpa!
–What are you doing?
–I'm just, uh…
trying to remember something.
–What is that?
–A Military patch.
Were you in the Military?
A friend of mine was. He was in
Afghanistan and he disappeared…
and no one
has heard from him since.
Do you have the Internet
on your phone?
No, it's just connected to the office,
by a really long piece of string.
Do you think, you can see
what you can find on this guy?
–Sure.
–He's been on my mind a lot lately,
his name's Captain Colter Stevens,
he's in the 17th Airborne.
Okay, you owe me.
–I'll buy you a cup of coffee…
–Why don't I get one for you now…
Christina… uhm…
I've been having these dreams lately…
Really vivid…
and you've been in them.
–Really?
What… oh, no, it's not like that…
Not that I wouldn't.
I would… It's just, um…
Uhm… I… I'll call you back
in a minute, honey. Yeah.
–Cramming?
–Uh… yeah.
For what?
Uh… Psych… and I got a big test
this morning, so I should get back to it.
–Can I, uh… borrow a pen?
–Uhm… yeah, sure.
Whoa! Hey,
that's not cool, man!
–Man… your bag is a mess.
–What're you doing, man?
Can never find what I'm looking for,
just like my bag. Just like my…
How about you let the guy
have his bag back?
Finish your deal!
Stay outta this tough guy
or doesn't end well for you.
You can't do that.
What am I doing?
What am I doing here?
–Jesus.
–Dick.
C/O/C/N.
Excuse me, ma'am. Hey, how you doing,
good morning. You work at Walter Reed?
Yeah, I used to.
–Um, I'm in the Military.
–You're in the Military?
–Yeah, yeah I am. I was…
–What was going on down there?
Oh, you know, uh…
we were just having a little bit of an
argument actually about, about this patch.
Is that what they train you to do?
Assault civilians?
Ma'am please. Do any of these letters,
they look familiar to you?
Do you know
what the “N” stands for?
It's Air Force and…
the “N” stand for Nellis.
Can I borrow your phone?
You know actually I can pay for it.
I don't even have to borrow it,
I can pay you for it.
I have like a… 100 dollars…
–Just for a couple of…
–I don't want your money.
–Just… bring it back.
–All right, thank you so much.
Come on, come on, come on,
come on…
Post operator.
–Um… Rutledge please.
–Please hold.
<i>Say, please?</i>
You tell him Captain Colter Stevens
is calling.
<i>–Hold the line.
–All aboard. Doors are closing.</i>
Dr Rutledge will be on
in a moment.
–I have to tell you something.
–I know, I found him.
–Your friend…
–I got him.
An Air Force Base. In Las Vegas.
–No, he's not…
–He's dead, Shawn.
–What?
I'm sorry, your friend was killed in action
two months ago.
No, you must've gotten
the name wrong.
Colter Stevens,
17th Airborne helicopter pilot,
was on the first site I tried.
His father's name is Donald, right?
This is from last week.
“Donald Stevens will join host
Eleonor Gwah…
”to discuss the death of his son,
Army Captain Colter Stevens…
”who died in Afghanistan in February…
and was honored posthumously
with the silver star”.
“Also on the broadcast will be
Army Sargent Rorbert Alvarez,
whose life was saved by Captain Stevens
in a firefight just outside of Kandahar”.
I'm sorry.
<i>Captain.</i>
<i>–Shawn?… Talk to me.
–Captain.</i>
<i>Captain Stevens,
my name is Captain Colleen Goodwin.</i>
<i>You're with operation Beleaguered Castle.
You're safe.</i>
<i>Now, can you tell me what you see?
Just look and think.</i>
–I see a card.
–That's good.
Do you copy?
We're taking a lot of RPG fire here.
Am I dead?
A radio listing is saying
that I died in a helicopter crash…
in the country, and my father
received a medal…
for me…
–Your condition is not the issue here.
You need to focus on preventing
any subsequent attacks.
Everything else is irrelevant.
A news report saying that I am dead
is irrelevant?
Until the person or persons who blew up
that train are in custody… yes!
Goodwin.
One soldier to another.
Am I dead?
Part of your brain…
remains activated.
What about the rest of me? I can see
my hands and my feet. They still move.
They're a manifestation. They're just
your way of making sense of all this.
So… what're you saying? You're saying
that I'm imagining this?
I'm… imagining that I'm still… alive,
that I'm in this capsule?
We have fourth amp dropping.
Captain, what just happened?
Can I ask you a question?
The… the capsule
is a manifestation as well.
–Where am I?
–Thats classified.
Fuck you!
Captain, I can not imagine
what you must be feeling right now,
but if are to prevent a second attack,
we need to send you back immediately.
And Captain, you cannot deviate
from the mission…
while inside the Source Code.
Even to investigate your… hmm…
Even to investigate
what happened to you.
There's only one continuum on this end
and it can not be unsettled.
Well, you know, I did unsettle it.
I called you from the train.
Just before the explosion,
at 7:46 this morning
they paged you with a call…
You may have made that call from the train,
but I would never receive it here.
It's a different reality, Captain.
If the call even went through it would be
received by a different me entirely.
This may be difficult for you to hear,
but you are a hand on a clock, understand?
We set you, you move forward.
We reset you, you move again.
And that represents
the entirety of your function here.
You know what?
Next time, I'll send you a pizza.
I see, if that makes an impression.
You cannot alter the continuum of
this reality from within the Source Code.
This can't be legal what you're doing.
In fact, your acquisition by this program
as well as the program itself,
has been reviewed and sanctioned
by a military court.
You know, many soldiers
would find this preferable to death.
The opportunity
to continue serving their country.
Have you… Have you spent
much time in battle, sir? Huh?
That's immaterial.
Any soldier I've ever served with could say
that one death is service enough.
Fine, you can have that in return
for completing this mission.
–What… have what?
–I'll give you what you want.
Terminate your service,
let you die.
This is taking too long, you've been
to easy on him. No more rest periods.
I'm certain, we can find other service men
with wounds similar to yours…
who'll consider being a part
of this program an honor.
Wait, wait, uh…
No, no, no, no, no. What?
Send him back.
Charge the drivers.
And Captain Stevens, I'd like you to
remember that it's not only about you,
but it's also about
2 million real world Americans.
Now you may not value
your own life,
I do however ask
that you value theirs.
Advice…
Hey Grandpa…
Calm yourself, you're back.
Did you find the bomber?
Uh… there…
are hundreds of people on that train.
Well then, check them out
one by one.
It doesn't matter what you do
to them, they're already dead.
Get to that gun, shoot them all if you
have to, but get us some usable intel.
No! No, wait!
We have to keep doing this,
until you find the bomber.
Please, I'm trying, I'm trying…
Who is the bomber?
Please, I'm trying.
I'm sorry, Captain. I know you're
exhausted and we're all frustrated,
but we can't fail.
You can do this.
–I can't, I can't…
–Yes, you can.
You're a born hero, son.
Even your father thinks so.
Saving people is what you do best.
It was about a stir, too.
I didn't wanna regroup back…
I just… started feeling like
he didn't wanna come home anymore.
–Dad?
–Somehow, he couldn't come home.
He wouldn't talk to me…
wouldn't hear me.
Finely he said he just…
couldn't leave his unit out there
without him and that was that.
Those guys… were his family.
I said two things
I shouldn't have. I don't know.
I never fully understood him.
And I can't believe he's gone.
Send me back in.
Please, don't blow me up again.
Hello?
I know, its you.
I'm gonna find you.
Turn around.
–Hey there.
–Me?
Why you look so surprised?
Don't.
Move. Move. Move.
The bag over there.
Move over, put the bag over there
and move over.
Move over.
Now hand me your phone.
You're done! You're done.
–What? —
–You can't kill anybody anymore.
–What? I don't understand—
You gonna trigger the bomb
with your phone.
What?
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.
Listen, my name is George Troxel,
I'm software engineer, okay?
I was talking to my wife.
Try it again.
Your call, dial it again.
Okay, I'm gonna press redial.
Your phone is gonna ring
and then I'm gonna shot you.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
<i>Hey! You dropped this.</i>
Wow, thanks.
<i>All aboard. Doors are closing.</i>
Shit, no, no!
No!
Come on!
Stop the train!
Hey!
Hey!
–Derek Frost
–Yes?
–See this?
–Yes.
–Recognize it?
–No.
Jesus.
How about
you give me your wallet?
Okay.
No, you left it on the train
deliberately.
I… must've dropped it.
No… you planted it there,
so everybody would think you were dead.
–I know, it's you.
–How do you know so much?
What is that thing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down!
–Do you… wanna see it?
–Very patriotic.
Slowly, slowly!
All right, all right.
Back up, back up! Back up!
Not many people…
could build that.
Alright, where is your next target?
Shawn?
Shawn Fentress.
Teacher… History.
I don't know you.
I think I killed your girlfriend.
Why?
Oh, you messed up my timing.
Why!?
Oh, you mean why this.
Because…
the world… is hell.
But we have a chance
to start over in the rubble…
but first there has to be rubble.
You're a teacher, you…
will understand.
Christina…
Stay with me!
Stay with me!
Everything is gonna be okay.
This isn't the end.
Check through there,
I'll go check this way.
<i>This is Beleaguered Castle.</i>
<i>Captain, this is Beleaguered Castle.
Acknowledge transmission.</i>
<i>Captain Stevens, this is Beleaguered Castle,
acknowledge transmission.</i>
I have your bomber,
I have his name.
–You have the bomber's name?
–Derek Frost.
He got into a rented white van
at Glenbrook Station parking lot.
Illinois plates,
5, Charlie, Golf, Y, 847.
Illinois plate, 5-C-G-Y-847.
All right, let's move.
And Goodwin… Goodwin,
there is a radioactive device in the van.
Some kinda bomb.
–Thank you, Captain.
–Yes, Ma'am.
Thank you, Captain.
–You're off the clock.
–About our deal?
I had hoped that you might reconsider
that for the sake of the program.
I have,
I want something else now.
Good.
I… I still wanna die,
but I wanna go back in…
and I wanna save all those people
on that train first.
–It doesn't work that way, it can't.
–No, I know, I know, I know…
I… I'm not really asking
to believe me, sir.
I'm just… I'm asking to
have the decency to let me try.
C/P/D/2 this is A/S/1/1
Van is approaching fens gate
to the quarry, over.
Roger that, A/S/1/1. We're on the vehicle,
that into the quarry road.
We'll stop him
about half way down, over.
AU-SWAT-2, this is C/P/D/2,
block the east end of the road, over.
AU-Swat-2, Roger that.
We are going to switch now to a
live feed from our Chicago affiliate.
The swat team is, uh…
approaching the white van.
An Illinois man has been
sorted through this morning…
The door is open… the door is open
and the man is on the ground.
It appears he has surrendered.
Earlier today the police discovered…
a lab in the backyard shack.
–Congratulations, Captain.
In recent months Frost started posting
anti-government statements on his website.
Yes Sir, it's a real validation
of the program…
a clear window into just how
revolutionary Source Code can be.
We finally have a powerful
weapon now, in the war on terror.
Congratulations Captain,
job well done.
He's not gonna send me back in,
is he, Goodwin?
I'm still awaiting an answer.
Are you married, Captain?
Jeff, why don't you go take a break?
You deserve to celebrate.
Sure.
–Can I get you something?
–No, I'm fine.
Why, you asking me on a date?
Sorry, poor taste.
Are you married?
No.
I'm divorced.
You think there is…
an alternate version of you?
A Goodwin
who made different choices?
What do you mean?
Like, uh… you didn't get married
or you didn't get divorced,
or just married someone else.
A woman who has taking
a different fork in the road?
No, I don't, Captain.
What you experienced was a shadow, it
was an afterimage of a victim on a train.
This is real life, here.
The one you were talking to
a dead helicopter pilot?
The program wasn't designed
to alter the past,
it was designed to affect
the future. And you have done that.
I missed something, Captain.
That train shouldn't have blown up.
There must've been a second detonator.
Something I couldn't see. A fail-safe.
It's a computer program, Captain.
The girl on the train,
all the others, they're lost.
I'm sorry about that.
I get it. I get it.
I know, quantum physics,
parable calculus.
You're wrong, Goodwin.
You're just plain wrong.
Captain,
Christina is dead.
She doesn't have to be, Ma'am.
I'll ask Rutledge.
I'm asking you.
I'm asking you…
Just… send me back.
Captain.
It's your choice.
At the end of this Source Code
I'll terminate your life support.
There willl be
no coming back.
I'm gonna save her, Goodwin!
It was an honor, Captain.
And I thank you for your service.
Good luck.
I took your advice.
You're gonna move to India
and become a Guru.
Careful, ma'am.
Yeah, I'm gonna go find myself
in the mountains.
Well, maybe, you have a cup of coffee
with me before you go.
Yeah, I like to do that pre-teen test.
Good.
Let's do it today.
Let's just skip work.
Bryan can find someone else to assist him.
–You know what?
–What?
I feel really good.
Why?
'Cause I've been waiting for weeks
for you to ask me for a coffee.
<i>Ticket.</i>
Okay.
Just give me a couple of minutes, okay?
And I'll be right back.
Gotta go…
save the world.
I knew he was a keeper.
Beautiful day.
–Ticket.
–Oh, I am sorry. Sorry.
–You trust the DOD?
–They got the finances.
Yeah, well sure.
Look, if we get the funding.
I guarantee you…
we can have at least…
8 source code projects up and running
by the end of the year.
–Really that many?
–Maybe more.
You're real hero, Dr Rutledge.
–Oh, thank you.
–We did save lives today.
–Yes, a true victory for the program.
–A great victory for us all.
–We'll talk soon.
So… exciting times.
Let's initialize the memory wipe on SC-1
and start crunching the data.
Sir…
We… we… we told Captain Stevens,
that we we're gonna let him die.
Let him die?
He just saved millions of lives today.
How many other disasters
might he avert down the line?
For all we know, he may be the only
candidate with which the system works.
So, let's clear his memory
and reinitialize Source Code.
Shall we?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, I just…
Hey Derek,
this isn't your stop.
Hey Mister,
you dropped this.
Come on, back here.
Ops.
Derek.
It's over.
Do you understand?
Hey, my name is Derek Frost
I planted a nuclear device…
in a white van, parked in the
Glenbrook Station CCR parking lot…
right now I am handcuffed to a pole
on the 944 CCR train,
headed to Chicago Union Station.
I'm a sick
and pathetic human being.
And I need to be locked away
for a very long time.
Okay.
Derek, there's no more burying
the world in rubble today.
You mind if I borrow this?
Captain, some of the guys and I
are gonna go celebrate.
And they… want me to initiate
the memory wipe, Captain.
Hello, Captain.
<i>–Hello?
–Donald Stevens?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>–My name… is Shawn Fentress.
–Who?</i>
I served with your son, Colter.
<i>Oh boy…</i>
It's a… I'm sorry it has taken me
so long to… call you.
Sometimes it just takes a while…
to figure out
what you wanna say… you know.
<i>Ah, don't be too hard on yourself.</i>
<i>It's not an easy call to make.</i>
How you doing, Sir?
<i>Uh… well um…</i>
<i>All that came back was some ash.
It's hard to believe that it was him.</i>
<i>How well did you know him?</i>
I was there when he died, Sir.
He said…
that the last time that you guys talked,
uhm… was tough… and…
he wanted to say
that he was sorry.
<i>I just wanted him back.</i>
<i>I loved him so much.</i>
<i>–I wish I could have told him that.
–He knows it.</i>
Take care, Mr Stevens.
–You okay?
–Yeah.
–Saved the world?
–Sorta.
So, where were we?
Getting some coffee.
Dr Rutledge?
What?
Shit!
What is too hard about it?
I run a business, okay?
Everything moves on time
or people get fired.
<i>That's how it works
in the real world.</i>
–10 minutes…
–Hey, buddy.
Don't sweat the small stuff,
you'll drown.
Oh thank you for the moment of Zen,
but nobody was talking to you.
What do you sell, self help cds today?
Why don't you just mind
your own business?
Security? Get me a detachment
of MP's here. This instant!
–Why are you always so bitter, Max?
–It's a bitter world we live in, my friend.
What you want from me?
It doesn't have to be.
I will bet you 100 dollars, that you can't
make all the people on this train laugh.
Oh right…
Actually, it's a 100 and 26 bucks.
–Is that your way of making fun of me?
–No, it's to have a better day…
No, no. It's good.
Easiest money ever.
Hey, I…
excuse me, people.
Uhm… one of our fellow passengers
has decided to offer me some money.
What has just gotten into you today?
You're like a… different person.
–It's the new me.
–I like it.
Women always mess up
my last name.
I was with a girl the other night
and she kept calling me “Getoff”.
She goes, “get off, get off”,
I'm going, no “Denoff, Denoff”.
She goes, “no you're fat
and heavy, get off!”
–Good?
–20 seconds.
Make it 10.
Goodwin.
Look at all this.
What?
All this life.
Goodwin,
open the Source Code door!
Why you keep looking
at your watch?
Christina, what would you do…
if you knew you had less
than a minute to live?
I'd make those seconds count.
–I'd kiss you again.
–Again?
Goodwin, open this goddamn door!
He's done enough, Doctor.
Everything's gonna be okay.
<i>It is a beautiful Monday
in Chicago today.</i>
<i>Temperature is expected to reach the
lower 60s. Right now 55 at the Lakeside…</i>
Well, he earned that money.
–Yeah, he did.
–He was funny.
Speaking of which…
I have no cash.
Come here,
I wanna show you something.
–It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?
–Yeah, it is a really perfect day.
–Do you believe in fate?
–Not really.
I'm more of a dumb luck kinda gal.
Come here.
So, what you wanna do today?
I think we should stay here
for a while.
This feels like exactly where
we're supposed to be, doesn't it?
–Good Morning, Jeff.
–Good Morning, Captain
“Lilly awoke in an evening dress
and an opera cloak”.
“In her hand were 5 playing cards”.
<i>“At some point today, you re gonna hear
about a failed terrorist attack…</i>
<i>on a commuter train near Chicago”.</i>
You and I kept that bomb
from going off.
<i>An attempted bombing
on a CCR train outside Chicago…</i>
<i>but it was foiled,
and the suspect was found on board…</i>
<i>and he's named Derek Frost.</i>
Goodwin,
anything I can help you with?
No, that's fine,
I'll come back later.
Well, keep an eye out.
One of these days, the right crisis
is going to rear its head…
and Source Code is going to have
its moment in the sun.
Yes, Sir.
If you're reading this email,
then Source Code works even better
than you and Dr Rutledge imagined.
You thought you were creating 8 minutes
of a past event, but you're not.
You've created a whole new world.
Goodwin, if I am right…
Somewhere at the Source Code facility,
you have a Captain Colter Stevens,
waiting to send on a mission.
Promise me you'll help him.
And when you do, do me a favor.
Tell him, everything is gonna be okay.
