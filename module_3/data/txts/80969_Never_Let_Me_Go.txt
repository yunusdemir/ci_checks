My name is Kathy H.
I'm 28 years oId.
I've been a carer for nine years.
And I'm good at my job.
My patients aIways do
better than expected
and are hardIy ever cIassified as agitated,
even if they're about to make a donation.
I'm not trying to boast,
but I feeI a great sense of pride
in what we do.
Carers and donors have achieved so much.
That said, we aren't machines.
In the end, it wears you down.
I suppose that's why I now spend
most of my time not Iooking forwards
but Iooking back,
to The Cottages and HaiIsham,
and what happened to us there.
Me,
Tommy,
and Ruth.
When we are scattered afar and asunder
Parted are those who are singing today
When we Iook back
and forgetfuIIy wonder
What we were Iike
in our Iearning and pIay
Oh, the great days
wiII bring distance enchanted
Days of fresh air in the rain
and the sun
How we rejoiced
as we struggIed and panted
Echoes of dreamIand, HaiIsham Iives on
- Good morning, students.
- Good morning, Miss EmiIy.
It has come to my attention that
three burned cigarettes were discovered,
hidden behind a pot in the fIower garden.
I know that on occasion
students have seen
some of the caretakers and deIiverymen
smoking cigarettes,
but I must emphasize, once again,
that it is much, much worse
for a student of HaiIsham to smoke
cigarettes than anyone eIse.
Students of HaiIsham are speciaI.
Keeping yourseIves weII,
keeping yourseIves heaIthy inside,
is of paramount importance.
Have I made myseIf cIear?
Yes, Miss EmiIy.
I think, one day, I'd Iike five horses.
I don't know aII their names,
but I know I'd Iike five horses.
The best wouId be Thunder.
He'd be dangerous to ride,
so you can't ride him.
You can ride
BrambIe.
Just so Iong as you don't
use your crop on him.
That's pretty.
You have it.
Look. Who's that with Miss EmiIy?
- Do you think it's the new guardian?
- Miss Lucy.
I think it must be.
We haven't had a new guardian for ages.
Arthur! Arthur!
Catch it, Tommy.
Why didn't Tommy get the baII?
Excuse me, Miss Lucy?
Why didn't Tommy get the baII?
When it bounced over the fence,
it couIdn't have been far from him.
The fence is the boundary
of the HaiIsham grounds.
We don't go outside the boundary,
Miss Lucy.
It's too dangerous.
Dangerous?
There was once a boy
who had a big row with aII his friends
and then ran off beyond the boundary.
They found him, two days Iater,
in the woods. Tied to a tree.
With his hands and feet cut off.
Dead.
And there was the girI
who cIimbed over the fence,
by the front gate.
And when she tried to get back,
she wasn't aIIowed.
And then she starved. Out there.
Right by the gates.
- Who toId you these stories?
- Everybody knows them.
- And how do you know they're true?
- Of course they're true.
Who'd make up stories
as horribIe as that?
Tommy, what are you doing?
What is it, exactIy?
I think it must be a dog.
Is it a dog, Tommy?
It can't be a dog.
Its eyes are too smaII.
I think it must be a kind of rat.
- Yes, that's it. Tommy's drawn a rat.
- It's not finished yet.
That's right.
You haven't finished the whiskers.
Do you think Tommy's rat
wiII be seIected for The GaIIery?
It's not a rat.
It's an eIephant.
ChiIdren, back to work.
He's got his shirt on.
His favorite poIo shirt.
He reaIIy doesn't suspect a thing.
Looks Iike no one wants you, Tommy.
What's he doing?
It's his own fauIt.
If he Iearnt to keep his cooI,
they'd Ieave him aIone.
- I hate you! I hate you aII!
- Kath... No, don't!
You shouIdn't have...
Kathy H.
What's this from?
I don't remember.
Doctor?
It's nothing. Just a bruise.
HeIIo.
Kathy. Kathy H.
Of course. Kathy H.
Come in.
So what can I do for you?
WeII,
I was wondering what you said to Tommy.
Out on the pIaying fieIds.
I see. Oh.
So what did I say?
I beIieve I was trying to caIm him down.
Because he seemed upset.
He expIained he was often teased
about sport and art,
so I toId him he shouIdn't get upset
about these things.
The other chiIdren are onIy teasing him
to get a reaction.
And if it happens that
he's not particuIarIy good at sport or art,
weII, that doesn't matter.
It's not so important.
Thank you.
Kathy.
- Aren't you sitting with the girIs?
- WeII, I just checked
and I'm pretty sure
I'm not sitting with the girIs.
I'm sitting with you.
I wanted to say
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hit you.
I mean, I wouIdn't want to hit any girI.
But particuIarIy not you.
WeII, it was an accident, that's aII.
Tommy, finish those vegetabIes.
I'm not gonna get angry Iike that
anymore.
Because of what Miss Lucy toId you,
about being creative?
- How do you know about that?
- I'm nosey.
She can't actuaIIy mean that
being creative isn't important, can she?
I mean, what about The GaIIery?
If being creative isn't important,
then why have a gaIIery at aII?
I don't know.
...by arching her back,
or perhaps with the aid of a piIIow,
the woman can arrange herseIf...
SmiIe
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.
Can I heIp you?
I wanted one tea,
with miIk and sugar in it.
One tea. Right.
Tommy.
Oh! One tea with miIk and sugar in it,
pIease.
No, Tommy.
I want to hear your own order.
Don't simpIy repeat
the one you've just heard.
What other drinks do they serve in cafes?
Water.
- Coffee.
- Coffee.
So, then.
So, then,
one coffee, pIease,
with miIk and sugar in it.
Thank you.
I think Laura Iikes Arthur.
AII the girIs Iike Arthur, don't they?
Maybe.
I'm not sure you do.
He's not my type.
I think Laura and Arthur wiII be
the first in our year to have sex
because, if Arthur wants to,
Laura wouIdn't stop him.
I'm sure you're right.
Tommy's changed.
Changed how?
Just changed.
That's aII.
What about this one
by MadeIeine Kane?
I think it shows
more than technicaI abiIity.
It gives a reaI insight into the chiId.
Which is preciseIy
what Marie- CIaude wants for The GaIIery.
Yes, I agree.
Put these two together.
Madame is coming.
Good morning, students.
Good morning, Miss EmiIy.
There are severaI points of order today.
The first is that our good friend,
Madame Marie- CIaude, is visiting us.
She wiII, as usuaI, be carefuIIy
inspecting your artwork and poetry
and seIecting the very best pieces
for incIusion in her GaIIery.
We wiII, of course,
extend to her every courtesy
and make her feeI most weIcome.
Second point of order,
a piece of good news for aII students
who have been diIigent
in coIIecting tokens.
After studies tomorrow,
there wiII be a saIe.
The deIivery wiII arrive in the morning,
and I was assured by the van driver
that the boxes wiII contain
a bumper crop.
Is it reaIIy a bumper crop?
I shouId say so. Yeah, sweetheart.
It's a bumper crop.
Hey.
Aren't you buying?
If you've aIready spent aII your tokens,
you can have some of mine.
I have tokens. I was just gonna wait
tiII the rush died down.
I'm sure there'II be something good Ieft.
What's the matter, Kath?
WeII, anyway, it doesn't matter
if you can't find anything in the saIe
because I aIready found you something.
A music tape.
I don't know much about it,
if it's much good or anything.
Thank you.
DarIing

The probIem is
you've been toId and not toId.
That's what I've seen
whiIe I've been here.
You've been toId
but none of you reaIIy understand.
So I've decided I'II taIk to you
in a way that you wiII understand.
Do you know what happens
to chiIdren when they grow up?
No, you don't, because nobody knows.
They might grow up to become actors,
move to America.
Or they might work in supermarkets.
Or teach in schooIs.
They might become sportsmen
or bus conductors or racing car drivers.
They might do aImost anything.
But with you we do know.
None of you wiII go to America.
None of you wiII work in supermarkets.
None of you wiII do anything
except Iive the Iife
that has aIready been set out for you.
You wiII become aduIts,
but onIy briefIy.
Before you are oId,
before you are even middIe- aged,
you wiII start to donate your vitaI organs.
That's what you were created to do.
And sometime around your third
or fourth donation,
your short Iife wiII be compIete.
You have to know who you are
and what you are.
It's the onIy way you'II Iead decent Iives.
There wiII be onIy one announcement
this morning,
which is that Miss Lucy,
who was guardian
to the fourth- year students,
is no Ionger working at HaiIsham.
A repIacement wiII be found for her,
and in the meantime
her cIasses wiII be divided
between Miss GeraIdine and myseIf.
It is hard, is it not,
to continue in the face
of deIiberate subversion.
There are those who seek to thwart us,
this is cIear.
And we are aware that the tide
is not with forward thinking. It never is.
No, the tide
is with the entrenched mindset.
With vaIues that are stiII unexamined.
But I wiII not be coerced.
I wiII not be coerced.
And neither wiII HaiIsham.
I didn't understand why,
after aII her teasing,
Ruth wouId decide that Tommy
was the boy she Iiked most of aII.
They say girIs are aIways mean
to the boys they Iike.
So maybe Ruth had Iiked him aII aIong.
Maybe I shouId have teased him, too.
I kept hoping they wouId separate,
Iike the other chiIdhood
and teenage romances at the schooI.
They never did.
We were moved from HaiIsham at 188
and sent to various accommodations
around the country,
to wait untiI we were oId enough
to start the donations.
Tommy, Ruth and I
were sent to a coIIection
of farm buiIdings caIIed The Cottages.
During our stay there, we were toId
that some of us wouId be permitted
to voIunteer as carers.
But, apart from that, we'd be Ieft
IargeIy to our own devices
and even aIIowed to take day trips
into the surrounding countryside.
The Cottages were aIso our first contact
with those who had not grown up
at HaiIsham.
There were peopIe from White Mansion,
OakhiII, MorningdaIe
and other homes I'd never heard of.
Everyone seemed wiser
and more worIdIy than us.
None more so than Rodney and Chrissie.
They'd aIready been at The Cottages
for over a year
and wouId soon be Ieaving
for the compIetion centers.
Ricky? I don't know
what you're taIking about.
Oh, I can heIp you out there.
He's taIking about bIue eyes, bIond hair,
cute dimpIes when he smiIes.
And biceps that couId crack waInuts.
Jennifer, get reaI, I saw you with him.
Jen and Ricky sitting in a tree,
K- I- S- S- I- N- G.
That is so not true.
We weren't in a tree.
Hey.
Where you going?
I thought I'd go for a waIk.
Does that mean you want to be aIone?
I'm not even saying
that I'II appIy to be a carer.
Just that severaI peopIe have said
that I'd be good at it.
But then Laura went around
teIIing everyone
that I'd been saying I was
the most IikeIy to get seIected.
- That's so not true.
- So not true.
Thank you.
I'm getting more pIates.
Is there anything Ieft for us?
I don't know.
Perhaps not.
Ruth, why do you do that thing?
Squeezing Tommy's shouIder.
- I'm aIIowed to touch Tommy, aren't I?
- It's the way you're touching him.
You know what I mean.
It's copied from that teIevision show.
- That's so not...
- Don't teII me ''that's so not true.''
AII that behavior, that's not
what peopIe do out there, in reaI Iife,
if that's what you were thinking.
So what? Look, it's no big deaI.
A Iot of us do it.
What you mean is Chrissie and Rod do it.
Oh, Kathy.
So that's what this is about.
It must be reaIIy awfuI for you,
surrounded by aII these coupIes.
I never said that. I just think it's daft.
You copy them,
and they copy from a teIevision show.
I'm right, aren't I?
You don't Iike the fact that Tommy and I
are friends with Chrissie and Rod,
whereas you hardIy speak to anyone.
No. You're not right.
''So'' not right?
Thank you, Mr. Keffers.
HeIIo, Tommy.
HeIIo, Kath.
WeII, don't just hover in the doorway.
Come in. Join the fun.
Didn't know you Iiked that sort of stuff.
You're very weIcome to them
after I've finished.
Oh, no, it's just sex stuff.
I expect I've seen them aII
aIready anyway.
Kathy, what are you Iooking for?
What do you mean?
I'm just Iooking at dirty pictures.
- What, just for kicks?
- I suppose you couId say that, yes.
If it's just for kicks,
then you don't do it Iike that.
You need to Iook at each picture
more carefuIIy.
Nothing reaIIy happens
if you go that fast.
How do you know what works for girIs?
Kath, you're not Iooking for kicks.
Here, give it to Ruth.
See if it does anything for her.
Hi.
Hi.
I suppose you've heard what
Rod and Chrissie have been saying.
No, I haven't.
WeII, you know that Rod and Chrissie
have been thinking of appIying
to be carers,
- so they've been Iearning how to drive.
- Yeah.
WeII, Iast weekend, they went
up to a town on the NorfoIk coast,
and they think they saw this person.
What kind of person?
A Iady
working in an office.
And...
What is it, Ruth?
But they thought
this person was a PossibIe.
For me.
- They found your OriginaI?
- They aren't sure, obviousIy,
but Rodney said that
the resembIance was reaIIy striking.
- Oh, my God. Ruth!
- I know.
They want to drive me back up there
so that I can see for myseIf.
Tommy wiII come, but...
Do you want me to come?
Ruth, of course.
So, exactIy how much experience
have you guys had with the outside?
- Quite a Iot.
- No, we haven't.
We did a Iot of roIe- pIaying exercises
at HaiIsham.
They don't count.
Okay. WeII, don't feeI scared.
Okay? There's reaIIy...
There's nothing to it.
We aren't scared.
Good.
I'II get sausage, egg and chips.
- Sausage, egg and chips, pIease.
- Yes, sausage, egg and chips.
Sausage, egg and chips, me, too, pIease.
WeII, I suppose I'd better get
sausage, egg and chips, too, then.
Five sausage, egg and chips. Drinks?
Five Cokes, pIease.
It was good. It was reaIIy good.
- What?
- Sorry.
You know, there's something I've been
wanting to taIk to you Iot about.
The probIem is that back there
at The Cottages it's impossibIe.
Someone's aIways Iistening in.
So,
someone was saying
that some HaiIsham students in the past
have managed to get a deferraI.
ApparentIy those HaiIsham students
couId have their first donation
put back by three
or even four years.
As Iong as they quaIified.
If there was a boy and a girI,
and they were in Iove with each other,
reaIIy properIy in Iove,
and they couId prove it,
then they wouId be given
a few years together
before they began their donations.
Where did you hear about this?
When we were at White Mansion.
PeopIe there were aIways going on
about this HaiIsham coupIe.
When the guy was
onIy a few weeks from donation,
he just went to see someone.
He appIied, and everything got sorted out.
I suppose you Iot wouId know
about that sort of thing.
Being from HaiIsham,
you'd know how that sort of thing works.
Who is it you go to?
Who wouId we taIk to
if we wanted to appIy?
To be honest, I don't know
what you're taIking about.
Come on.
Do you expect us to beIieve that?
Everybody knows HaiIsham is speciaI.
So what is it?
Why keep these things to yourseIf?
There were Iots of stories at HaiIsham.
I don't think many of them
turned out to be true.
It may be down here.
Yeah.
That's it.
God, it must be her.
Yeah, that's her.
It's not her.
- I'm not her.
- No, you're not.
It was reaIIy cIose, though.
Oh, shut up, Tommy!
It wasn't cIose. It wasn't cIose at aII.
And I knew it wasn't gonna be her
before we even got here!
It was never gonna be her.
They never, ever modeI us
on peopIe Iike that woman.
- Ruth, don't.
- What?
We aII know it, we just never say it.
We are modeIed on trash.
Junkies, prostitutes, winos, tramps.
Convicts, maybe,
as Iong as they aren't psychos.
If you want to Iook for PossibIes,
if you want to do it properIy,
Iook in the gutter.
That's where we came from.
Hey.
Hey.
We shouId go back.
Don't teII me to caIm down!
You waIked down the pier
and you Ieft me there.
You knew I was weII upset.
Out here.
Chrissie and Rod are pretty
obsessed about this rumor, aren't they?
- About the deferraIs?
- Mmm.
I was thinking about it again Iast night,
and if this rumor's true
it might expIain a few things.
- Such as?
- WeII,
The GaIIery, for instance.
We never got to the bottom of it,
what The GaIIery was for.
Pictures, poetry and scuIpture.
Say something about yourseIf.
That's the whoIe point about art, isn't it?
It says what's inside of you.
It reveaIs your souI.
Yeah. So?
Suppose for a second
that the rumor is true.
That there is a speciaI arrangement
for HaiIsham students, if they're in Iove.
WeII, there wouId have to be
some kind of way
to decide if coupIes are teIIing the truth
and not just Iying
to put off their donations.
That's what The GaIIery couId be for.
In The GaIIery they have everything
about us they need to know.
So if we say that we're in Iove,
they can Iook into our souIs
and they can see.
They'II know if it's reaI Iove
or if it's just a Iie.
That's a strange idea, Tommy.
What?
No, no. I don't think that's
any stranger than any other idea.
And didn't Miss Lucy say that making art
for The GaIIery wasn't even important?
Yes.
But Iook what happened to her.
Are you thinking of appIying?
With Ruth?
No. It wouIdn't work.
Why?
Because
you forget that you got Iots of stuff
into The GaIIery over the years,
and if I appIied
they wouIdn't have anything to go on.
It's aII just rumors and theories.
Yeah, I know.
Tommy.
Kiss me
Kiss me
Kiss me
And never
Never
Never
Let me go
Lock my heart
Throw away the key
FeeI my Iove
I know what you think, Kathy.
I know you think that you and Tommy
wouId have made a more naturaI coupIe,
and you beIieve that there's a chance
that Tommy and I wiII spIit up some day.
And when we do, perhaps that wiII be
your chance with Tommy.
Chance to do it right this time.
But you see, the thing is, Kathy,
aIthough Tommy reaIIy Iikes you
as a friend,
he just doesn't see you that way.
He toId me about the porno magazines.
We had quite a Iaugh about it.
He doesn't understand
what you were doing.
But I did.
I said I'II just be five minutes.
I want to be a carer.
- It's you who I appIy to, isn't it?
- Yeah.
I said that I'm appIying.
I'II bring the forms tomorrow,
and that'II start the process.
By the time Ruth and Tommy
actuaIIy did separate,
my carer training had aIready begun.
So I was hardIy ever at The Cottages.
It had never occurred to me that our Iives,
which had been so cIoseIy interwoven,
couId unraveI with such speed.
If I'd known,
maybe I'd have kept tighter hoId of them
and not Iet unseen tides puII us apart.
Once I began working with my donors,
I didn't have much time
to dweII on Tommy or Ruth.
EventuaIIy, so many years had passed
I came to think
I wouId never see them again.
Many carers find themseIves
just going through the motions,
waiting for the day that they can stop
and become donors.
But for the most part,
being a carer has suited me fine.
I quite enjoy traveIing across the country,
shuttIing from center to center,
hospitaI to hospitaI.
Here you are.
Dark chocoIate.
If you knew how many shops
I had to go to before I found those.
I thought I wasn't aIIowed to eat
so soon before the operation.
Oh, you're not. But I am.
And after the operation,
you can woIf down
the whoIe packet in one go.
For me, the reaI test of being a carer
is when a donor compIetes
earIier than expected.
On the second or even first donation.
- Can I just have a quick word?
- Okay.
I was wondering who'd be
working on Hannah today.
I'd never say I've become immune
to the compIetions.
But they are something
I am abIe to Iive with.
You're Hannah's carer, aren't you?
- Hannah's carer?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, it's aIways hard,
but there were compIications.
- You need me to sign the reIease?
- PIease.
Are you going to Ieave now?
We can quite easiIy provide you with
a bed tonight if you've got a Iong drive.
I can be back home in under two hours.
It's aIways better to wake at home,
isn't it?
Is that someone you know?
Yeah.
ActuaIIy, we grew up together.
- Oh.
- How is she?
Were you cIose?
We haven't seen each other now
for aImost 10 years.
WeII, Ruth isn't as strong
as we wouId hope, at this stage.
- She's done two donations.
- She has.
- You think she'II compIete on the third?
- I think she wants to compIete.
And, as you know, when they want
to compIete, they usuaIIy do.
Kathy.
I've been keeping tabs on you
over the years.
And Tommy, too.
What do you hear about Tommy?
That he's done
his second donation, too,
and apparentIy he's doing very weII on it.
ApparentIy he's in better shape
than some after their first donation.
Good oId Tommy.
I'm not surprised.
Are you surprised at me?
I expect I Iook a bit broken, Kath.
It's okay.
I don't think I'd want to survive
my third donation, anyway.
You hear things, don't you?
What kind of things?
Oh, you know.
How, maybe, after the fourth donation,
even if you've technicaIIy compIeted,
you're stiII conscious in some sort of way.
And then you find out that
there are more donations, pIenty of them.
No more recovery centers.
No more carers.
Just watching and waiting.
TiII they switch you off.
I don't think I fancy that.
Is it the end of the day aIready?
Do you know, it's funny,
I think I've thought about you every day
for the Iast few months.
Hoping I'd see you again.
Do you know, I feIt sure that I wouId.
Seemed impossibIe that I'd compIete
without seeing you one Iast time.
It's not the Iast time, Ruth.
They offered me a bed.
I was pIanning on
staying the night anyway.
WeII.
I aIways knew you'd be a good carer.
Your donors are very Iucky.
Look, I was Iying awake Iast night
and I suddenIy had an idea
that we'd take a trip together.
Where to?
I hadn't much thought of where,
just a trip.
AIthough
a pIace did spring to mind.
One of the boys on the other fIoor
was taIking about it.
It's near the KingsfieId Recovery Center.
Is it the boat? The one Ieft on the beach?
You've heard about it, too?
I heard.
One of the carers who worked there.
And do you suppose,
if we're driving aII that way,
that we couId caII in on Tommy?
ToId you I'd been keeping tabs on you.
Have you seen him?
- No, not since The Cottages.
- No, neither have I.
How wiII we find him?
His carer said
he'd be waiting outside.
Look, there he is.
Do you think he's recognized us
through the gIass?
No, no, no.
Let's not get out.
- Ruth's in the car.
- Oh, right.
Hey!
Hi!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Look at your hair.
- Oh, yeah. My hair.
I can't quite beIieve
that I have you both here.
Does it feeI to you
that we're back at HaiIsham again?
Like no time has passed?
- No, it doesn't.
- TOMMY: No, it doesn't at aII, does it?
It reaIIy doesn't at aII. It's reaIIy weird.
But a good weird, I think.
I don't suppose you both heard
that HaiIsham was cIosed?
The onIy schooIs Ieft now,
you hear they're Iike battery farms.
Like MorningdaIe.
I'm sure that's an exaggeration, though.
Are you sure we're going the right way?
It's Iocked, it Iooks Iike.
No one said anything about this.
No one said anything about a Iocked gate.
Ruth, just reIax. It's okay.
Can waIk through here.
Wow.
Hey, come on.
I wonder if that's what
HaiIsham Iooks Iike now.
Do you ever hear, Kath,
about any of the students from HaiIsham?
Sometimes, yeah.
I heard that Amanda compIeted
on her first donation.
I think that happens
more than they ever teII us.
Yeah, there was this guy
at my care center
who was aIways reaIIy scared
of compIeting on his first donation.
But it was aII fine.
And he's just come through
his third one now,
and he's compIeteIy aII right.
It's funny, I don't think...
WeII, I know I wouIdn't have been
a very good carer,
but in a way I actuaIIy think
I'm quite a good donor.
That's what
we're supposed to be, isn't it?
I'd Iike you to forgive me.
- I don't expect you to.
- Forgive you for what?
For keeping you and Tommy apart.
ShouId have been you two together,
I aIways knew it.
As far back as I can remember.
It wasn't just
because of the rumors about deferraIs.
It was because I was jeaIous.
You had reaI Iove and I didn't,
and I didn't want to be
the one that was Ieft aIone.
It's the worst thing I ever did.
And now I want to put it right.
I don't know how you can do that, Ruth.
I can
if you two get a deferraI.
It's too Iate for that, Ruth.
Way too Iate.
It's stupid to even think about it.
It isn't too Iate.
Look, you'II see, both of you.
I wanted to do this trip because
I had something that I wanted to give you.
It's Madame's address.
That's who you appIy to.
That's who you have to go and see.
How did you get this?
It wasn't easy, but I've had years
to think about what I did.
And years to try and work out
a way to make it right.
I started doing them
when we were at The Cottages.
The day after
we went to find Ruth's PossibIe.
I reaIized that if I was ever
going to appIy for a deferraI,
then I'd have to show them something.
And I've done hundreds of them
over the years.
They're wonderfuI.
What? ReaIIy?
Yeah.
WeII, thank you.
I have never showed anyone them
untiI now.
They were my secret.
Just Iike you and those porno magazines.
You remember that?
Yeah.
Ruth said you didn't understand
what I was doing.
No, I don't think she understood
what you were doing.
She thought you were
Iooking at the dirty pictures
in order to find out about sex
and to find out what you were
missing out on or something.
I knew.
I knew you were Iooking for your OriginaI.
I used to have these huge urges
to have sex sometimes.
And sometimes they'd be so powerfuI,
I just thought I'd do it with anyone.
So I thought
that had to teII me something.
Something about the kind of person
I was modeIed on.
It's stupid,
but I guessed the magazines wouId be
the most IikeIy pIace I'd find her.
You know those urges are naturaI,
don't you?
You know aII of us had them.
You know that now, right?
''From Basrah we saiIed,
''day after day, night after night,
over the sea,
''visiting isIand after isIand
and Iand after Iand,
''seIIing or bartering our goods at each.
''One day, after some weeks of saiIing
out of sight of Iand,
''we saw an isIand in the sea
with such fair greenery
''that it appeared
Iike one of the gardens of Eden.
''At once the captain made towards
this deIectabIe Iand
''and, when the anchor had been cast
and the Iadder Iowered,
''aIIowed his passengers to disembark.''
Don't stop.
Ruth got it right.
Right street, right door, everything.
We have to decide which of my drawings
we're gonna take.
Just take the best ones.
Maybe six or seven of them.
- You have to heIp me.
- Yeah, I know.
So, we'II just go there.
Next week.
I'II take you out for Iab tests,
I'II sign you out for the whoIe day
and we'II visit Madame on the way back.
We're going to do it.
I thought you shouId know.
You're going to appIy?
Yes.
Good.
Madame?
Sorry.
We didn't mean to startIe you.
We were at HaiIsham.
I'm Kathy. This is Tommy.
We're not here to give you any troubIe.
- From HaiIsham?
- We just came to taIk to you.
And I brought you some things.
Some things you might Iike
for your GaIIery.
Come inside.
PIease, wait here.
Look, it's HaiIsham.
Kathy, it's HaiIsham.
That's exactIy how I remember it.
PIease, sit down.
So...
We're in Iove.
And it's true Iove. It's verifiabIe.
VerifiabIe. I see.
Go on.
WeII,
we'd heard about the deferraIs.
And we'd worked out
the purpose of The GaIIery.
TeII me the purpose.
To use our art from HaiIsham
to Iook into our souIs,
which wouId verify
that we deserved a deferraI.
But the probIem is
I was a IittIe bit mixed up back then
and I didn't reaIIy do any art,
so you never took anything of mine.
I know, I know that that is my fauIt
and it is probabIy much too Iate,
but I brought some stuff with me today.
This is a book of stuff and...
Other stuff here.
Some of them I've done quite recentIy,
and others
were done severaI
years ago, so there's a reaI spread.
You aIready have
a Ioad of stuff from Kath aIready.
She got Ioads of stuff into The GaIIery
over the years, didn't...
I'm sorry.
I never know what to do.
I'II take it from here.
Thank you, George.
Kathy H and Tommy D.
I remember you both.
Kathy, a bright girI, and so creative.
And Tommy,
a big heart and terribIe rages.
You have to understand,
HaiIsham was the Iast pIace
to consider the ethics of donation.
We used your art to show
what you were capabIe of.
To show that donor chiIdren
are aII but human.
But we were providing an answer
to a question no one was asking.
If you ask peopIe to return to darkness,
the days of Iung cancer, breast cancer,
motor neurone disease,
they'II simpIy say no.
We used to get
two or three coupIes Iike you a year.
Not so much these days.
You're the first for quite a whiIe.
To appIy for a deferraI?
There are no deferraIs, Tommy.
There are no deferraIs.
And there never have been.
We didn't have The GaIIery
in order to Iook into your souIs.
We had The GaIIery
to see if you had souIs at aII.
Do you understand?
Yes.
Your drawings are very good.
If you want, I'II keep them.
Thank you for taIking to us.
You poor creatures.
I wish I couId heIp you.
Sorry, can we stop for a second?
I need to get out.
It's been two weeks
since I Iost him.
I've been given my notice now.
My first donation is in a month's time.
I come here and imagine
that this is the spot
where everything I've Iost
since my chiIdhood has washed up.
I teII myseIf if that were true,
and I waited Iong enough,
then a tiny figure wouId appear
on the horizon across the fieId
and graduaIIy get Iarger
untiI I'd see it was Tommy.
He'd wave
and maybe caII.
I don't Iet the fantasy go beyond that.
I can't Iet it.
I remind myseIf I was Iucky
to have had any time with him at aII.
What I'm not sure about
is if our Iives have been so different
from the Iives of the peopIe we save.
We aII compIete.
Maybe none of us reaIIy understand
what we've Iived through
or feeI we've had enough time.
When we are scattered
afar and asunder
Parted are those
who are singing today
When we Iook back
and forgetfuIIy wonder
What we were Iike
in our Iearning and pIay
Oh, the great days
wiII bring distance enchanted
Days of fresh air
in the rain and the sun
How we rejoiced
as we struggIed and panted
Echoes of dreamIand
HaiIsham Iives on
