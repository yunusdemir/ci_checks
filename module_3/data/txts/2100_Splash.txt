- I dropped something.
- Ralph, talk to him.
- <i>And a wooly jaw</i>
- Listen to your father.
- <i>Wooly bully</i>
Come on. From over there,
we can see Cape Cod.
We were just on Cape Cod.
We could have stayed there.
I would have saved $ 12.
Allen, sweetheart,
don't you wanna see Cape Cod?
All right, darling. You know where
we are if you change your mind.
Allen!
He's over there!
Oh, my God!
- Allen! Allen.
- Thanks a lot. Thanks. You okay, Allen?
- Get me a towel. A towel.
- Sweetheart!
- Get me a towel. Thanks a lot.
- How could you do that?
Get inside. Come on.
<i>Augie, pick up line four, please.</i>
<i>Augie, line four.</i>
- Where are my cherries?
- Mr McCullough, they came in...
but there was a fog upstate
and the highway patrol...
Where are my cherries? If I don't have
my cherries in five minutes...
you don't get your money
and you starve and you die.
Jerry!
Jerry, where the hell
are McCullough's cherries?
Oh, they're here, but you gotta take
a look at this stuff, man.
Uh, Mr McCullough, uh,
be right back.
Where are my cherries?
Aw, Augie, where the hell you grow
these things, under your arms?
Jesus. Snails with stems.
Forget it. Get 'em outta here.
- Get him outta here.
- You got it.
Bauer. Yeah, thank you.
- Hi, honey. What's up?
- Look, you know. We get a lot of rain.
- The cherries get a little slime.
- Honey, I can't hear you.
- Now, you agreed to take these
off our hands.
- Can I call you back?
- When the hell did I agree to that?
- Not you, your brother.
Ah. All right.
Victoria, I can't hear ya.
Look, what I'm doing is important too.
I'll call ya right back.
So my brother
bought your slimy cherries?
Yeah. Me and Freddie, we were
playin' poker. He had two pair.
I had a flush. He had no cash,
so, uh, we worked this out.
Who put this goddam fruit here?
I'm all right,
if anyone's concerned.
- Good mornin', Freddie.
- Allen! Allen!
- Bauer, I want a simple "yes" or "no."
- One more second, Mr McCullough.
I made it! I'm in <i>Penthouse</i> magazine!
They printed my letter!
- They printed my letter!
- Ah, listen, I'm very, very happy...
I'm in the Forum section. The story's
entitled "A Lesbian No More."
They printed every word I wrote.
It's a beautiful story.
Here, I want copies of this
for everybody. Augie!
- Hey!
- Hey, good to see you!
- Great game the other night.
We gotta do that more often, you know?
- Freddie?
- This guy's a great poker player.
- Can I talk to you upstairs, please?
Come on.
- Cheats like a son of a bitch.
- Freddie, you and I have to talk.
What is it? The missing petty cash?
It was the cleaning girl.
- I don't care about that.
- You don't?
- No.
- Then it was me.
I admit the whole thing.
Well, I still don't care
about it, Freddie.
I love this guy! Do you hear me?
I love him! Give me a kiss.
- Oh, Freddie.
- Give your older brother a kiss.
- What's the matter? You too big?
- No. Freddie! Oh.
I love this guy's head.
Hey, curly.
- Here's a buck. Go watch my car.
- Oh! Where are my...
Mr McCullough, your cherries, yes.
Uh, believe me when I tell you...
that you're not gonna be satisfied
with what we have for you.
Okay, Bauer, you're ruined. Everyone's
gonna know that you left me dry.
You're finished!
You're a ghost in this business!
- How'd you like some bananas at cost?
- Deal!
Jerry, set up our friend Mr McCullough
bananas at cost.
Allen, wait a minute. I've gotta get
outta here early today, remember?
Aw, gee, that's right.
Yeah. Today's the big day, huh?
Yeah. Now don't forget. Ushers have to
be there early too. Okay?
- I'll be there yesterday.
- Right.
<i>Will someone please get</i>
<i>thoseJonathans off the truck?</i>
Are there any messages,
Mrs Stimler?
Yes.
Uh, what are they?
Huh? Oh!
Uh, your father called.
He wants you to call him back.
Um, Mrs Stimler, our father
passed away about five years ago.
Do you remember?
Right. Uh...
Uh, should I get him for you?
No, no, no. We'll...
Uh, I'll take care of it.
You j... You just get back to work.
Okay?
- What's with her?
- Oh, she had a little accident
over the weekend.
Got hit in the head
by some lightning.
Aw, it is not funny, Freddie.
It's not funny.
I'm sorry. That's not funny.
That's not funny.
Besides, she's okay. She can still
do certain things around the office.
Like what?
Jump start a car?
Jump start a car!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- What the hell are you doin' down here?
Maybe I went to the,
uh, Club "A" last night.
Somethin' new for you.
Maybe I met Mr Buyrite,
the owner of Buyrite Supermarkets.
Maybe we had a few drinks.
And maybe, just maybe,
we're his new produce suppliers.
I'm proud of you!
That's great! Which store?
Not "which store."
The whole chain.
I hope you are
joking with me right now.
Think big, be big, my friend.
He was a Green Beret colonel.
I made up a story
about you being wounded in 'Nam,
and he wants to do business.
Now, he's coming around this morning
to check out the operation.
This morning? Great, Freddie.
This is only chaos down here.
- Augie brings me slimy cherries
from upstate.
- So what? So what?
- Jerry's getting married tomorrow
night. Did you realize that?
- So what?
- I was out drinking with this bum
all night long. I'm busting my buns...
- I haven't picked up
my tuxedo this evening...
- all night drinking with this guy
gettin' a big deal.
- All the way up on East 47th Street.
- Come on. You can handle this, Allen.
Come on. Relax.
- For cryin' out loud.
- Oh, yeah. I'll handle it fine.
No problem.
- You'll handle... Clean up the desk.
- Why does it always
look like a pig sty here?
- Don't touch the desk.
Leave the desk alone.
- Do what I do. Throw it in the drawer.
- Don't touch... I have
a system on the desk!
- Phone for you.
- What? Oh.
Yes! Oh. Yeah. All right.
Thank you, thank you.
Hi, Victoria. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I meant
to call you back. I forgot.
What's the matter?
Your voice sounds funny.
What? Now?
You're moving out of the apartment now
while we're talking on the phone.
Well, yeah, I know we were
gonna talk about it, but...
Victoria, this is... This is a little
impulsive, don't you think?
- If we were married, you wouldn't
just move out like this.
- She might do that. Sure.
- Will you get off?
- Was that you?
- Get off the phone. Put it... No, no,
no, no. Not you, Victoria, no.
- I'm so sorry!
- No.
- I didn't know you were on the phone.
Tell a guy.
What do you mean,
do I love you?
Well, I...
W-Well, we-we met
and, and I, uh...
W-Well, you moved in,
didn't ya?
W... It's... No, it's just that it's
a very complicated thing that...
Hey. Do you love me, huh?
Well, there you go.
There she went.
- Now, what a huge wedding this is.
- I know. I wonder if Cindy's here.
- Oh, my God. You...
- Cindy! Hi!
- How are you?
- How are you? How are you?
- Excuse me.
- Oh, you look so pretty.
So pretty.
- Okay.
- Oh, very...
- Oh, darn!
- Aw!
My flash never works on this thing.
Figures. My mother-in-law gave it to me.
- Get up.
- What?
- What?
- That was embarrassing
when you were ten, Freddie.
Look, if something works for me,
I stick with it.
I've been doin' a lot of thinking.
I gotta get more involved in the
business, and I intend to.
I mean that this time.
I-I'm going to.
I know the business. I was there
at the beginning with Dad. Remember?
I just... I just wanna know if...
Do we sell fruit and vegetables,
or is it just fruit?
You know, by the time I came home,
she was already gone.
- Victoria left, huh?
- Yeah.
You know why
she left me, Freddie?
- Because I didn't love her.
- That bitch.
Hi. Hi. Anywhere
but the first three rows.
- Anywhere but the first three rows.
- Hey!
- Hi, Freddie.
Hey, Allen, where's Victoria?
- Hi.
- Oh, uh, she, uh, she's sick
and, uh, she can't make it.
- Aw.
That's too bad. I'm sorry
to hear that. See you.
Hey!
Why didn't I love her, Freddie, huh?
Can you answer me that?
Why didn't I love her?
I mean, she... She had everything.
She was...
She was bright, she was sensitive,
she was beautiful.
- Hey, Allen!
- Hi. Hi.
- Uh, where's Victoria?
- Uh, flu. Bad flu.
She's very sick, and she can't make it
because of the flu.
- Give her my love, will you?
- You bet. Sure.
I can't even give her
my love, Freddie.
I'm telling you, something...
Something in here, it's not working.
There are worse organs
not to be working.
Hi, guys. Hey, Bauer,
where's that pretty lady of yours?
She's not coming, okay? What?
Do you want your money back?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe it's all for the best, huh?
- Hey, Allen.
- She left me! She moved out!
My life's a shambles! Okay?
That's the news. You want the weather?
Anywhere but the first three rows!
You should really lighten up on the guy.
That's the bride's brother.
You see, drinking is really
a matter of algebraic ratios.
How drunk you get is dependent upon
how much alcohol you consume...
in relation
to your total body weight.
You see my point? It's not
that you had a lot to drink...
it's just you're too skinny.
- Marceau, a bunch
more drinks here, please!
- No, no!
- Freddie, I don't wanna get drunk.
- But you are drunk.
You see, a sober person
would've reached for the pretzels.
- Is he gonna be there long?
- I don't know.
- Aw, I'm on the bar!
- You're on the bar!
Come on. Off the bar.
Aw, this stool is in your way.
Let me move that for ya.
Uh-oh. You fell.
Ooh, that hurt. Ooh, you're
not havin' a good day, are ya?
- Wasn't that
a beautiful wedding ceremony?
- Aw, that was a beautiful ceremony.
It was... It re...
- It really was. It was a beautiful...
- Just the most gorgeous ceremony...
- a lovely...
- I've ever seen in my life.
- How're ya doin'?
Fabulous Freddie Bauer here.
- Okay. Fine. How are you?
- Freddie.
- Where'd you get those?
- My grandmother, she left them to me.
- She did?
- Yeah.
- Boy. They're beautiful.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Y-You guys are in love, aren't you?
We just met.
That doesn't matter.
I know about these things.
See, I... I can see, I can tell.
You... You two guys, you're in love.
And I think that's...
I think that's beautiful.
Thanks.
Uh, listen, I don't live
too far from here.
Why don't we just go to my place
for a quiet drink, you know?
- I can get this...
- Do I expect too much out of life?
- Hey, hey. Look what you did, now.
- My dress. I can't believe this.
- Oh, God.
- I'm sorry. Here.
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
- Well, you do it!
- Here, let me get this...
- Both of you!
- You're both crazy!
- I'm sor... I'm sorry. Look. Look.
I don't ask that much, do I?
I mean, I know...
I don't ask to be famous
and I don't ask to be rich...
and I don't ask to play centre field
for the New York Yankees or anything.
I... I just wanna meet a woman.
I wanna meet a woman and,
and I wanna fall in love...
and I wanna get married
and I wanna have a kid...
and I wanna go and see him
play a tooth in his school play.
Is that... It's not much.
But I am... I'm kidding myself.
This is never going to happen.
I'm... I'm gonna grow old
and I'm...
gonna grow lonely
and I'm gonna die and...
I'm gonna be surrounded
by a bunch of rotten fruit.
- Oh. No kidding?
- Hey...
Freddie.
Allen! Allen! I want you to meet
some friends of mine.
- This is Tawny, and this is Jill.
- No, I'm Tawny.
You're Tawny! Tawny tiger. And
this is Jill, with a four-letter word.
- Hey!
- This is my brother Allen.
Hi. Freddie, can I talk to you
for a second?
Oh, absolutely. You'll excuse me.
Oh, I'll be right back.
We'll whisper some more.
Oh, I got some whispering
for you.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
Oh, pack your bags tonight, my man.
We're goin' to Rio.
These girls have got
a timesharing condominium.
- We're gonna share some time with them.
- No, no, Freddie.
I... I'm...
I'm goin' to Cape Cod.
What? What are you talkin' about?
Cape Cod? Why would you go to Cape Cod?
I... I don't know. 'Cause I...
'Cause I like Cape Cod, Freddie. It's...
I feel better up there. I look out the
water and I feel closer to something.
- Cape Cod over Rio.
- Nature or something.
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Let me drive you.
- No, no, no.
- Let me drive you up there. I'll drive.
- No, no, no. No, no.
- You got enough money?
- Yeah, I got plenty.
- Yeah?
- Thanks.
Can I have some, then?
- Where to?
- Cape Cod, Massachusetts.
You break that, you pay for it.
Oh, well, I'm sorry. I usually really
enjoy smashing the glass with my face.
Okay, Cape Cod, that's about 300 miles.
You got the cash?
What is this?
Careful with that.
Be careful with that! What do
you think you're loading here?
This is delicate scientific equipment.
Hold it, hold it. Put it down.
You see this?
You see that? It says, "This end up."
Do you know what that means?
It means this end up.
Why don't you try holding that end up?
All right, all right. Get away.
I'll do it myself.
Get away!
Give me a hand.
Easy.
- Move that end around.
- Excuse me!
- Mornin'.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Uh, I was dropped off
on the wrong side of the beach...
and I was wondering if you could
take me over to the island?
Well, uh, we're not...
We're not going...
We're just... We're taking the boat...
We're gonna... We're not going out there!
Well, what, uh... Have you seen
anyone else along this beach?
No, just me and the moron twins.
We're not twins.
- What is all this stuff?
- I knew it!
Who sent you up here?
Dr Ross from Chicago?
Who-Who's Dr Ross from Chicago?
Oh. "Who's Dr Ross?"
You're good. You're very good.
I suppose you're just
some harmless beachcomber...
who happens to wear a tuxedo!
How dare you try and horn in
on someone else's research!
- Look, I'm just a guy
trying to get out...
- Walter Kornbluth is not a man
to be taken advantage of.
So you just stay out of my way,
sonny.
All right, let's move out!
There's a guy down the beach
runs people out to the island.
What's the name?
The guy or the island?
I'll find him.
What's the matter?
You look a little nervous.
Yeah, well, the truth
of the matter is, Fat Jack...
I've, uh, I don't know
how to swim.
- You can't swim?
- No, sir.
Then you wouldn't
want me to do this!
Stop! Cut... No, please!
Cut it out! Please!
There's water coming in the boat!
- Aw, just havin' a little fun.
- Well, don't do that.
What is that?
What's the matter?
I-I guess when I rocked the boat,
I must've got a little water
in the engine.
I can fix it.
I'm mechanical.
- Did you fix it yet?
- No, uh...
- I'll go back for the other boat.
- What?
Where are you going,
Mr Fat Jack?
Back to the dock.
It's only a few miles.
I can swim it.
I'll be back with the little boat.
The little boat?
I knew it.
I knew that guy
was spying on me!
I wanna go down!
Hey, Mr "Cornbeef."
Kornbluth.
What you lookin' for down there?
Buried treasure?
Wanna know what I'm lookin' for, boys?
I'll tell ya.
None of your goddam business,
that's what I'm lookin' for!
Get outta my way!
Let's pee down his air hose.
- Yeah.
- You get that.
Piece of shit.
Aw, gee.
Ouch!
Ouch!
Hello.
Do you have any idea how I,
I got here? Did you save me?
Uh, do you...
Do you speak English?
Hey, come back!
Hey, come back, please!
Just... Just tell me who you are!
I gotta talk to you!
C-Can I call you?
What's your number?
I don't know how to swim.
I don't know how to swim.
Come back!
Oh, why didn't I learn how to swim?
Please, just...
It's a mermaid!
It's her!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute! Don't go!
Come back!
I gotta take your picture.
All right. Ready.
Hold it!
- Hi, Mrs Stimler.
- Hi.
What happened to your head?
Lighting?
- Uh, no, no, a boat hit me.
- Oh.
- Uh, Mrs... Mrs Stimler?
- Yes?
- Nothing.
- So nice to have you back.
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.
The statue is a gift
from French citizens...
and has come to symbolize hope
for oppressed peoples everywhere.
Over the course of a century, Miss
Liberty has seen the New York skyline...
which once she dwarfed, rise
in great mountains of stone and steel.
Now if you'll go inside,
Miss Simkins will continue the tour.
Come. Come on. Here we go.
Let's go. We're backin' up.
Come on. Here we go. Come on.
Okay, okay.
You got feet, use 'em.
Don't touch my hat.
Do not ever touch my hat.
That's it. That's it.
Up, up, up, up, up, up.
Okay.
Welcome to the Statue of Liberty.
The statue is a gift
from French citizens...
and has come to symbolize hope
for naked women everywhere.
Boccie balls!
Hey, hey, hey! Come on.
Hey! Don't be doin' that.
Vinnie, take a picture of me.
Get a picture of me. Vinnie!
Take my picture! Take my picture!
Got it? You get it? You get it all?
The statue was a... was a gift from...
see, from French people.
Get outta the way.
Let me see what's goin' on...
Oh, okay, missy.
This ain't California.
We don't go for this stuff here.
Come on.
- Boo! Boo!
- Boo! Boo! Boo!
Take care!
- What's your name, miss?
- She don't speak no English.
- And you do?
- Uh, here. She was carryin' this.
What's this?
Who's this guy?
- Is that enough or you want some more?
- No, no, that's plenty.
That's all the business we can handle.
Let's talk terms.
- But he doesn't have the slightest clue
what's goin' on...
- Don't worry about it.
- We'll move it out
first thing in the morning.
- Uh, Bauer.
Your brother told me about your
unfortunate experience in Vietnam.
Huh?
The incident in Vietnam.
Remember?
The grenade going off in your helmet.
Does it still bother you?
- You're wearing a bandage.
- Yeah, he's here. Hey, Allen.
- Yeah?
- Phone.
Uh, excuse me, okay?
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Allen Bauer. Yeah, speaking.
- Yeah! On my way!
- I believe this is, uh...
Allen? Allen, where are you going?
Allen!
- What happened?
- Telephone.
See, he was on the phone in 'Nam
when the grenade went off...
and ever since then
he runs...
and gets in a car
and drives away.
- Oh.
- I don't know why. It just happens.
- Oh.
- Let's review this.
- You got a licence plate?
- No, I don't have a licence plate.
- I live across the street!
- Pardon me? Excuse me! Hey, yo!
- Mr Police Officer, sir.
- Hey!
Take it easy!
What do you want?
Bauer. My name is Allen Bauer,
and you guys called me.
- Hey! Did any of you guys
call for an Allen Bauer?
- Allen Bauer.
Bauer. Oh, yeah.
That's, uh, for her.
Right over there.
Hi.
I take it you know this girl?
- Yeah, I do.
- Who is she?
- I don't know.
- Of course.
Afternoon, Mr Bauer.
You're home early today.
Yeah.
Uh, yeah. That, uh...
That doorway spins, see.
It spins around.
You wanna get this fixed, Timmy?
Right.

Hello?
Hey, I'm home!
- I'm looking for a girl, Timmy.
- Two hundred bucks.
No, no, no, no. The one I came
in with this afternoon. The blonde.
- Oh, she left.
- Any idea where she went?
- Well, I put her in a cab.
- To where? To where, Timmy? Where?
- Bloomingdale's.
- Bloomingdale's. Great. Thanks.
Yo! Hey, taxi!
Hey! Oh, taxi, wait!
<i>She works hard for the money</i>
- <i>So hard for it, honey</i>
- <i>Come on! Come on! Let's go!</i>
<i>She works hard for the money</i>
<i>so you better treat her right</i>
Excuse me, miss,
we're, uh, getting ready to close.
- She's been here for six hours.
- <i>She works hard for the money</i>
<i>So hard for it, honey</i>
Uh, excuse me, miss. I'm going
to have to insist that, uh...
that, uh, you stop doing that.
<i>Come on. Hold that step again.</i>
She's, uh, she's exercising.
- <i>Wonders where she is</i>
<i>And it's strange to her</i>
- Give her a minute.
- Sir! Sir, we're closing. Sir.
- Yeah, yeah. I know. I know.
- Just give me three minutes.
- Come back.
Three minutes!
You can time me!
<i>One of them got through, too,</i>
<i>and they was rescued.</i>
Oh! Thank God.
Excuse me. Do you know this woman?
Yeah, yeah, I do.
Just don't ask me what her name is.
Well, we've been trying to tell her
that it's closing time, but, uh...
she doesn't seem to understand.
Yeah, well, that's because
she doesn't speak any English at all.
Hello, Allen.
How was your day?
Uh, excuse me. I never went to college,
but, uh, wasn't that English?
Thank you for letting me use
your television.
It was very educational.
It's all right, miss.
Uh, what's your name?
It's hard to say in English.
Well, just say it
in your language.
All right.
My name is...
Hey, how 'bout those Knicks?
I'm confused. Why is it you haven't
said anything to me until now?
- I didn't know English.
- Oh, I see. And now you do?
Yes, I learned this afternoon
from television. It's wonderful.
Now I can ask you questions,
and if you answer them correctly...
you can win one of these valuable
prizes... an attractive wall clock...
a matching washer and dryer set,
or a brand new car!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me go first, okay?
Who are you?
Where are you from?
Just begin when you were born
and-and finish up...
right when you blew up the TVs.
Pretty.
Well, uh, yeah.
I've never really thought
about it before, but yeah.
Are you from Cape Cod?
No, I'm from another place.
Oh, yeah?
I got a cousin from there.
- Are you an American?
- No.
Well, then why were you in Cape Cod?
And why are you now in New York?
And how was it that
the cops found you naked?
- What's that?
- What? The music?
Music. I like it.
I heard some in the television.
<i>- Dance Fever.</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah</i>
<i>I love ya, girl</i>
<i>Darlin', darlin'</i>
Uh, hi, hi. We better go, hon,
or else we'll be late.
- You never heard music?
- What's that?
Uh...
- Oh, gosh.
- Jesus Christ! Are you stupid?
- What's that?
- It's a movie theatre.
What the hell are you doin'?
You're gonna get me killed!
Cut her some slack!
She's from out of town, huh?
- Why don't you keep her on a leash?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Have a nice day.
Hello?
Did you see this?
It's wonderfully delicious...
and so good for you.
So while you're here,
maybe you oughta watch a little less TV.
Uh, how, uh, how long are you
gonna be in town?
Six fun-filled days.
Oh, six days.
Is that all?
Six days.
When the moon is full.
Oh.
When the moon is full.
If I stay longer than that,
I can't ever go back.
Oh, I get... What? Is there some sort
of immigration problem or something?
Where did you get that? Where...
Oh, for...
Sir? Here you are, sir.
There you go.
You know, I'm gonna have to call you
something in English...
because I can't even pronounce the...
what, the...
- What are English names?
- Well, English... Well, there's
millions of'em, I guess.
Uh, Jennifer, Joanie, Hillary...
Careful. Hey. Those are hot.
Remember that.
See, names, names.
Uh, Linda, Kim...
Where are we? Madison.
Uh, Elizabeth...
- Madison.
- Samantha.
- Madison. I like Madison.
Well, Madison's not a name.
Well, all-all right. Okay. Fine.
Madison it is.
Good thing we weren't at 149th Street.
Are we going back
to where you live now?
Okay, uh, here's the thing.
I was gonna find you a hotel.
But I figure that
after this afternoon...
Well, I... I mean,
I just assumed that...
Would-Would you mind
staying with me?
I want to stay with you.
You're the reason I came here.
- Uh, th-that was a kiss.
- I know.
Madison?
- Madison?
- Allen?
Yeah, of course it's Allen.
- What are you doing, sweetheart?
- Taking a bath.
- Can I come in?
- No!
What was that?
M-Madison, are you all right?
- Everything's fine.
- Well, then let me in.
I'm... I'll be right there.
I'm just changing.
Enough is enough, Madison. Come on.
Open the door. Something is wrong.
Allen, can you make me some pancakes?
Make you some... Madison.
All right, Madison. This is getting
scary. You either open up this door...
- or I'm gonna break it down.
- No, Allen. Please.
- All right. That's it.
- Allen, no! No!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Well, why wouldn't you
let me in?
I was shy.
You were shy?
After the car and the elevator...
and the bedroom and on top
of the refrigerator, you were shy?
I was shy.
She was shy.
- Hey, B.B. Brain!
- Yeah?
Do you see this hose?
- This is so I can breathe.
- Uh-huh.
Do you wanna get
your chair off it?
Huh?
- The <i>Star Confidential?</i>
- Yeah.
- Why are you reading that?
- I don't know.
What possesses the uneducated
to purchase these things?
- It's interesting.
- You're not helping yourself.
You're not... What?
This is not news.
Give me this.
You know what's in here? Nothing!
You have sex. You have perversion.
It's all fabrication. Look at this.
A naked woman
at the Statue of Liberty.
Where would they find
a girl to do that?
- Her hair would...
- Ow! My head!
- Let me see that!
Take me back to shore! Now!
Hello.
Madison, what is it?
What's wrong? What happened?
It's the saddest thing
I ever saw.
It's <i>Bonanza.</i>
A man killed another man, and he died
right in the middle of the street.
Uh, no. No, no. This is only TV.
I thought you understood about TV.
See, this is... This is make-believe.
This is just pretend killing
that-that's going on here.
See, now, now, this guy, he's an actor,
and next week he'll get shot
on another show.
When you think about it,
it's kind of funny.
You mean I'm supposed to laugh?
Yeah. There you go. Yeah.
Uh, I got... I got you something.
It's beautiful. I love it.
Uh, no. You open it.
There's more?
- Do you like that?
- Yeah, I do.
I don't know why, really.
Just, uh...
something about it.
It's always appealed to me.
Do you like the sea?
No. When I was about eight years old,
I had this accident on a ship, and...
I remember.
What?
Uh, I can't...
I forget the words.
Um, what's, uh... I understand.
Did you get hurt?
No, no, I didn't, but...
when I was underwater,
I could have sworn I s-saw...
What?
- Nothin'.
- What?
- Nothin'.
I was just a stupid kid.
- You know, they're gonna
tear this park out.
- Why?
Oh, they're gonna build some riverfront
condos or some such nonsense.
What are you gonna do, huh?
- You wanna go home?
- No, I have five days left.
No. No, no, no, no. My home.
Oh.
Yes.
Why do we want to go
to a political dinner?
- Because the president will be speaking.
- President of what?
President of the Three Stooges fan club.
The president of the United States!
- Wow.
- I tell you, we'll be rubbin' elbows
with the big boys.
- You think big, you'll be big.
- I guess so.
Listen, uh...
would you mind if I took Madison
to this thing instead of going with you?
What?
- What?
- What?
Somethin' in here not working?
"Oh, I'll never fall in love, Freddie.
I can't.
It won't work with me."
Who said anything
about me being in love?
You haven't been to work
in two days.
- So?
- Admit it.
- No.
- Admit it.
- No.
- Eye gouge!
- Admit it.
- No.
- Bone-crusher!
Son of a bitch!
- How long we been playin'?
- About five minutes.
Oh, God!
My heart's beatin' like a rabbit.
You, uh, want a beer?
No, thanks.
So, tell me this.
If you're not in love with her,
how come these little things she does...
drive you crazy so much, huh?
Little things? Freddie...
the woman learned how to speak English
in a single afternoon.
She could probably speak
English already.
- I think she was in shock
from bein' arrested, you know?
- Well, now what about that, huh?
What about a woman showin' up naked
in a public place, Freddie?
Well, I'm for it, of course.
But you yourself said that she had
some kind of, what, immigration problem?
She's on an ocean liner in the middle
of, uh, international waters.
And, uh, she sees America.
Looks good.
So she greases her body up
like a channel swimmer.
She dives in. She, uh, goes through some
sharks. Has some heavy trouble there.
Goes through the Coast Guard,
through some mine fields.
And then she's, uh, she's on shore.
She's okay. See?
But what about the-the bathtub
and th-this moon stuff?
- And what about all those TVs?
- Now, look, I'm being serious.
I've had a few minor fiascos in my own
love life, and I admit that freely.
Freddie, you took a date
to one of your own weddings.
I-I'm, uh...
I'm a free spirit.
I'm extremely liberal.
I'm a freewheelin' dude.
You know what your problem is?
You're in love with this girl,
and you're trying to
convince yourself you're not.
I... I just don't know, Freddie. Just
something about it isn't-isn't right.
I'll serve. You hold the beer.
That'll be your handicap.
- Oh, we're gonna play?
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna teach you
a lesson in humility.
- All right. Wait.
Humility 101. You all set?
- Yeah.
- All right. Here we go.
This is what we came to hear?
You call us and tell us
that you have stretched...
the frontiers
of palaeontology and zoology.
And we interrupt important,
serious work...
to fly here on a moment's notice,
and you give us mermaids?
Don't call us,
call the comic book companies.
That's enough. Gentlemen,
we have a seminar in three weeks.
I expect you to be
ready for that.
- Allen, you're here!
- Hey, what... what...
- I got you a present. Come on.
- Wait a... Wait. What?
- I gotta...
- Don't look. Close your eyes.
- I gotta close the door!
- It's a surprise.
- What... What are you doing?
All right. Come on.
Okay. Look.
Wha... You, uh... w...
Well, that's-that's big.
Yeah, this is...
This is very big...
and it's really here.
It's just so big!
They were gonna tear it down,
so I bought it for you.
Now, where did you get the money
to pay for something like this?
Madison, where's your necklace?
- I traded it for the statue.
- Why?
Because I love you.
Oh, Madison.
Madison, I love...
uh, this st... uh, present.
I love it.
And I love you.
What's happened to you? You were
the brightest student in my class.
True, emotionally you were 12 years old.
- I was 12 years old.
- That's right. That's right.
And look what you've become.
A schmuck.
- There is a mermaid in New York City.
- Oh. Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure.
Y-You mean, this... this...
this naked girl? How come she has legs?
She has legs out of the water.
She has fins in the water.
You taught me that, Dr Zidell.
Don't you remember?
You taught me all the legends.
You used to bring me into your office.
You used to show me charts on the walls
of where sailors had claimed
they saw mermaids.
Walter, that... that was for fun,
for relaxation...
not for you to build
your whole life on.
I'm gonna prove to you,
and to everyone else...
that that girl is a mermaid.
How? Y-You gonna get her wet
so everybody sees she has fins?
Taxi!
- Ohh!
- Watch it!
- Hey, watch it, buddy!
- Excuse me.
Look out!
- What does he think he's doin'?
- Hey, what's goin' on?
Hey!
Oh, my.
Oops.
Nice earrings.
- Allen, is something the matter?
- No, no, no. Nothing at all.
You know, I was thinking, you, uh...
- You don't have to leave the country.
- I do.
No, no, you don't. See, there's all
kinds of stuff we can do to get around
the, uh, immigration laws.
For instance, I could... I could
give you a job down at the market...
and you could get a work visa.
Or, uh, you could, uh, marry...
like, an American, yeah.
- Then they have to let you stay.
- Our food is here.
Oh. Well, we'll, uh...
I guess we'll talk about it later.
Do be careful, madam.
Uh, the plate is very hot.
Gee, well, thank you.
These, uh... These look terrific.
She's really hungry.
Hey, Joey. How you doin'?
Great.
You were very, very good.
Come on... Oops. Come on.
Let's sit down and talk.
- Your nose is cold.
- Oh, I... Well, I don't wanna
talk about my nose.
Your ears are all red.
I don't wanna talk about
any part of my face.
But I, uh, I do wanna talk about,
uh, what happened in the restaurant.
Oh, I'm sorry. That's how
we eat lobster where I come from.
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.
I don't care about that.
No, I don't care about that.
You see, I was tryin' to do something in
there, and I guess I did it very badly.
I was trying...
to ask you if,
if you wanted to get married.
Madison, will you marry me?
- No.
- What..."No"? Just "no"?
Uh, you don't wanna think about it?
You don't wanna, uh, uh,
kick it around for a little bit?
- I can't.
- Why?
- I can't tell you. I...
Look, I know you have some big secret
that you think you can't tell me,
but you can.
- What, you know, you're already married?
- Allen...
What, you're dying? You were once a man?
Whatever it is, I don't care.
You can tell me.
Allen, I only have three days left.
Please make them wonderful.
Okay.
You wanna skate some more?
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Allen.
- You know them?
- No.
No, I've just seen 'em before.
I guess they've been comin' here
together about 40 years.
- They look very happy.
- Well, now, why shouldn't they
be happy? Huh?
They get to spend their whole lives
together, don't they?
Is this really what happens to water
when it gets cold?
Yeah.
Where I come from,
it never gets cold.
Oh, well, hey,
what a breakthrough there.
You know, you j... you just
really just opened up to me there.
- Your voice sounds funny.
- Well, it's called sarcasm.
What, they don't have that
where you come from either?
No.
Well, now, they don't have anything,
do they?
They don't have ice, and they don't
have music, and they don't have clothes.
Just what kind of a place
is this, Madison?
Look, Madison. Madison! Madison!
- Hey, those skates are rented!
- Hey, look, just give me
one second, okay? Madison! Madison!
Madison, please! I'm sorry!
Let her go.
Show some dignity, for Christ's sake.
Madison!
- Yeah. She's tall, blonde.
- Haven't seen her.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
- Hey, Charlie, how's it goin'?
- All right.
- What time the trucks gonna get in?
- I don't know.
- Allen?
- What?
Yes.
See, if we get our blood test today,
we could be married as early as tomorrow
if we wanted to.
Allen, before we get the blood test,
I have to tell you everything.
- So tell me.
- Not today.
Yeah, but, see, if we get
the blood test today...
No pressure, no pressure, mind you,
but if we get the blood test today...
as soon as you tell me,
well, then we can get married.
Listen, you are going to love being
married to me. I was born to be married.
I just so happen to come from
a long line of married people.
My mom and dad, they were married.
Their moms and dads,
they were married too.
Son of a bitch.
- Allen, I thought we were
going upstairs.
- Yeah, I know, I know.
But I love you
and I am not gonna lose you again,
so we are getting married tonight.
We're gonna get in the car and we're
gonna drive to Maryland. I don't know
why I didn't think about it before.
Freddie always gets married in Maryland.
You don't need a blood test down there.
Oh, there's this dinner
with the president. Damn!
That's okay. Hey!
That's all right. That's okay.
We will just go to Maryland
after we have dinner with the president.
- Hey, we'll even already be dressed up.
- Allen, I haven't told you...
I know, I know, I know.
You haven't told me this big
secret of yours. That's okay.
You can tell me in the car
on the way to Maryland.
You know what I hope?
I hope we have a boy and a girl.
What kind?
Wh... What kind?
Well, the-the young kind, I-I guess.
'Cause the, the older ones
are a little hard to deliver.
- We're getting married tonight.
- Oh! Wonderful! Congratulations!
- Oh, thank you.
You. Why is this bread in here
instead of out there?
And the butter is hard like a rock.
Why, you...
- Do you have a broken arm?
- No.
No, it... it's fractured, 16 places.
Why are you here?
Union sent me.
My God.
The president is here!
The president's here!
The president's here!
Bob Hollins!
Thank you so much.
I'm just a corn-fed Kansas boy, but
you people are the Big Apple of my eye.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I-It's great to be back in New York.
Alert. Alert. Table five.
Intercept busboy with a suspicious hump.
He's reaching for it.
Get him now. Get him now.
- Sir, I'd like a word with you, please.
- About what?
- Just a word with you.
Oh, this has nothing to do with
the president. This has nothing
to do with the president!
- Shut up! Get him out of here!
- Get your goddam hands off me
before I whip your...
Well, I guess he just found out
what his dinner cost.
- I wanna talk to the press!
I wanna talk to the press!
- Get back! Get back!
- Who is this guy?
- I... I have a formal statement to make!
And in Bob Hollins
you have a candidate for Congress
who is in touch with the people...
a man who built up the business
left to him by his grandfather.
- What was once a small pushcart
on wheels is now...
- Allen.
- One of the largest fast food chains
in America.
- Yeah?
- It's time for me to tell you.
- And how did he do it?
- What, now?
- With perseverance.
- Right now.
- With ingenuity. With great ideas.
- Oh, okay. Okay.
- Great.
- Not here.
- And more importantly...
Fine. Fine. Sure. Come on.
With fresh meat.
- Shut up!
- I am not crazy!
There is a mermaid in there!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I'm not...
- What mermaid?
- I am a scientist!
- Charlie, get those
damn media people back!
- The grey BMW.
Get those people back!
Oh! Hey, I know that guy.
I saw him up on Cape Cod.
Gee, I thought he was crazy then.
- Get back!
- There she is!
- There she is!
- Hey! Get him! Get that son of a bitch!
- Don't let him shoot that thing!
- He's got a gun!
- Don't let him shoot it! Hold it!
- No!
- Get that thing out of his hand!
- Oh, my God, he's shootin' her!
- Grab that hose!
Grab him! Get him!
- Get that hose!
- Ohh!
- The son of a bitch!
- What the hell is goin' on?
Down! Down!
I was right!
Behold the mermaid!
- Let me outta here!
- Who are you? What is your name?
- Allen! Allen!
- What is your name? Why are you here?
- What are we gonna do?
- Grab her! Grab everybody!
- Allen!
- I want to see her.
- Allen! Allen!
- Move it! Move it!
- Get her! Get her! Get her!
- Allen! Allen!
I did this! I did this!
- I knew I was right!
- Allen! Please!
- Pick her up! Move it! Move! Move!
- Allen! Allen! Allen!
- Allen!
- Move back, I said!
<i>Lieutenant Hanley, you're wanted</i>
<i>at the front desk. Lieutenant Hanley.</i>
Good afternoon, Dr Ross.
<i>Dr Hill, line five, stat.</i>
- Buckwalter!
- Sir!
- Gentlemen.
- Doctor.
- Anything?
- No change.
I am not a fish!
How many times am I gonna
have to tell you people that?
Now, will you just let me out of here?
Please?
Huh? People?
- Let's try some interaction.
- Fine. Jim?
I guess they thought
you might be one.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
You said whatever my secret was,
you'd understand.
I know.
- I...
- Thought at least I was a human being.
Allen...
He's been in the water 12 hours.
He's obviously just a man.
Get him out of there
so we can concentrate on her.
He's here! This is Greg Martin,
WNEW Radio, here with Allen Bauer.
- Mr Bauer,
when did you meet the mermaid?
- Uh...
- Mr Bauer!
- Tell me, where did you meet?
- Ow! Ow!
- Did you know that she was a mermaid?
- Did you actually make love to her,
Allen?
- Oh, no. That's a stupid question.
- Did she eat worms, Mr Bauer?
Mr Bauer, would you have to
make love to her in water?
- Hey, listen, Jack, that's none
of your business. I don't have to...
- Is she... Is she...
- Is she some kind of a mutant
or a missing link of any kind?
- No... No, no! She's not!
Allen! Allen! I'm from <i>People</i> magazine.
Is it true that she's also seeing
Burt Reynolds?
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
- One more question.
- No! No!
Leave him alone!
Leave him alone!
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
- Get out of the way, lady,
or I'll drop ya!
- Please let me through!
- Oh, well, I'm just... I'm just...
- Allen! Allen! You all right?
- Yeah! Get me outta here!
- Is anyone here from <i>Penthouse</i> magazine?
- No!
Then we ain't talkin'!
Hey, Allen.
What are you lookin' at? You never saw
a guy who slept with a fish before?
Get back to work!
Oh, oh, Mr Bauer, you had a million
messages. I wrote them down right here.
You got calls from CBS, NBC, ABC, AP...
UPI, Ted Turner, <i>Time, Newsweek...</i>
Marineland, <i>Ripley's Believe It or Not</i>
and Mrs Paul.
Not now, Mrs Stimler.
Okay?
"Fishman"?
"Fishman"?
That's what they're
calling you on TV too.
Personally, I think it's kinda cute.
- So, how is she?
- How is she? She's, uh...
She's a mermaid.
I don't understand.
All my life I've been
waiting for someone...
and when I find her, she's...
she's a fish.
- Nobody said love's perfect.
- Oh, Freddie!
I don't expect it to be perfect but,
for God's sake, it's usually human!
Every day people meet and they fall in
love... every day... and look what I got.
Look what you got.
Yeah, let's look at what you got.
Let's take a good look at what you got.
- People fall in love every day, huh?
Is that what you said?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Well, that's a crock.
It doesn't work that way.
Look, do you realize
how happy you were with her?
That is, of course, when you
weren't driving yourself crazy.
"Every day." Come on.
Some people will never be that happy.
I'll never be that happy!
What am I talkin' to you for?
You don't know nothin'.
Mrs Stimler!
Does she look a little pale?
Ah. That's a good day's work.
Now, tomorrow I want to see how
she interacts with other marine life.
Then we'll be ready for
the internal examination.
- Internal examination?
- Of course.
I'll want to study her pulmonary system,
uh, reproductive organs, everything.
Dr Ross, are we considering...
how the subject is responding
to the examination procedure itself?
I'm considering everything.
Ah, yes, well,
I'm sure you are, Dr Ross.
How stupid of me. Of course.
But let me ask you this.
Are you considering the possibility
that you might be a sadistic pig?
While we are baring our souls,
Mr Kornbluth...
I must honestly tell you I have never
considered you a man of science.
You're not a member of my team.
Run along now, Walter,
and see if you can't find a unicorn.
- What's that?
- Painkiller, Mr Kornbluth.
Whoever punched you
cracked your tooth.
We are going to be
very close to the nerve.
I don't deserve any painkiller.
Just drill.
Oh, you want pain.
Well, we aim to please.
- Get out.
- What are you doing in here?
This is my off...
- Get out, Doc!
- Please stay! Aah!
- Okay.
Let's talk.
Hey! Hey, put that down.
Put that needle down.
- You stay away from me.
- Hey, I said let's talk.
- Come on!
- Put it down!
- You stay away from me!
- Put it... Put it...
Drop it!
What a week I'm having!
- You've destroyed my life, Kornbluth.
- I didn't mean to.
I just had to prove to everybody
that I wasn't crazy.
I'm a man of science.
I just didn't think about
how it would affect you...
or her.
I'm really a nice guy.
If I had friends, you could ask them.
I've been on the phone to every employee
of the United States government...
calling 'em sons of bitches.
Nobody can even get in to see her.
I can.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Good afternoon, Dr Kornbluth.
I wasn't expecting you back today.
These are Drs Jarred and Johanssen
from the Stockholm Institute.
I thought they were coming in later
with Dr Ross.
Oh, no, no, no. No, that story
was just to fool the press.
Oh. Hey, um, you know,
I'm half Swedish.
- Well...
- Uh, just a second.
- How the hell did you do that?
- Well, let me tell you somethin'.
Many of your finer nudie films
come from Sweden.
Well, after you see 'em
four or five hundred times...
the stuff starts to sink in.
- Afternoon, Buckwalter.
- I'm sorry, Dr Kornbluth.
I'm not supposed to let
anybody in there until Dr Ross
gets back with them Swede people.
- These are the Swedish doctors.
- These are Swedes?
Uh, come here.
Isn't that one right there
kinda dark, you know?
He's dirty from the trip.
Come on, Buckwalter, let us in.
- I don't know. I'm not supposed to...
- What are you afraid of, Buckwalter?
Do you think
we're gonna steal the mermaid?
- Well, no.
- The mermaid! Stealing the mermaid!
What are we gonna do, fold her in half
and put her in a briefcase?
- In a briefcase! In half!
- I guess it's all right. Go ahead.
Yeah, I guess it's all right. Go ahead.
- That's good.
Good joke there. Good joke.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Uh, this, uh, big secret
you've been keeping from me...
is it that you're a mermaid,
or is there something else?
No, that's it.
Allen, don't feel guilty.
Guilty? About what?
About not loving me any more.
Oh, Madison.
All the time we were together
you always knew how I was feeling.
Can't you tell now?
<i>Well, I left my wife</i>
<i>in New Orleans</i>
<i>With 48 kids</i>
<i>and a can of beans</i>
<i>- Left, right, one...</i>
- Oh, my God!
- What?
- Back! Back, man!
Cover his face, for God's sake!
- What happened? What's goin' on
in there? What happened?
- That creature!
Dr Johanssen bent down to examine her
and suddenly these rays
came right out of her eyes!
Don't go in there, man!
She'll melt your face right off!
I knew somethin' like this
was gonna happen.
What should I do? What should I do, huh?
Oh, stop whining.
Seal off the entire area.
- No, I'll call the Pentagon.
- Pentagon? Are you crazy?
- You wanna create a national panic?
- I don't wanna die!
Pull yourself together!
Now look, don't let anybody
in that room. You understand?
I'll be back. I'll be back
with nuclear weapons. Come on, Doctor.
Good afternoon, Dr Ross.
Who are your guests?
Drs Jarred and Johanssen
from the Swedish Institute.
Um, sir?
Dr Kornbluth just, uh, left with
the two Swedes a few minutes ago, sir.
Hiya, boys.
Come on in. The water's fine.
Let's get her back. Now.
And arrest him.
<i>Repeat.</i>
<i>This is not a drill.</i>
<i>Chase One, we have a blue BMW. Over.</i>
<i>Flyin'over Central Park South.</i>
Come on, come on, come on.
You wanna know something?
I don't think we're being followed.
Wh... Well, that was easy.
That was simple. We did it!
- It was my plan.
- Walter, you're a genius.
- I am a genius.
- You're a genius.
- But you came in with the Swedish thing.
- Yeah, well, you know, I tell ya.
- That was... That was a brilliant touch!
Boy, I didn't even like you
when I first met you!
Nobody likes me when they first meet me!
Allen?
- Move!
- All right! Here we go!
Whoa!
<i>Suspect heading south on Broadway.</i>
Get outta the way!
<i>Yeah, I see him</i>
<i>heading toward City Hall, hard.</i>
Watch out!
<i>Unit One. Lost 'em</i>
<i>in the Wall Street district. Over.</i>
- Stop the car.
- What?
- Stop the car and let me out.
- I'll slow them down.
- How?
- Just do as I say!
I caused all this.
Now I'm gonna finish it.
Get the hell outta here. Go!
What a week I'm having!
- Hey, man.
- Move it!
<i>Be advised.</i>
<i>Suspect heading for port, East River.</i>
Hey, mac!
Move that thing outta here!
Up yours, Gomer.
I'm waitin' for a fare.
All right, move out!
Move out! Move out!
Come on, let's go! Hey!
<i>Unit Five. He's heading south.</i>
- I was ready to stay with you forever.
- I know.
Now they know who you are,
they're never gonna leave you alone.
- I can't ever come back to you.
- I wish I could go with you.
- You can.
- How?
- It can be done.
- How?
Remember when you were eight years old
and you fell off the ship?
You were safe under the water,
weren't you?
- Yeah.
- You were with me.
You mean, that... that was real?
You mean, that was you?
- That was you!
- Yeah!
This is great! This is great!
I can go with you and still come back
and, and see Freddie at Christmas.
You can't ever come back.
Madison.
I understand.
<i>You on the dock, don't move!</i>
<i>You're under arrest!</i>
<i>Let the girl go! Step back</i>
<i>from the dock! You're under arrest!</i>
You have to go.
- Move out!
- Let's go!
I love you, Madison.
Go. Go!
<i>Get that guy on the dock!</i>
Leave her alone!
- Just leave her alone!
- Come on!
Come on, you dinks! Come on, you dinks!
Come on! Come on!
Madison.
Madison!
<i>You there! Stay where you are!</i>
<i>We'll get you out! Stay where you are!</i>
Madison!
<i>One fine day</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>And love was rare</i>
<i>As love can be</i>
<i>I saw stars</i>
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>
<i>We flow together</i>
<i>Once and forever</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>One fine night</i>
<i>Love let us see</i>
<i>How far we'll go</i>
<i>How good we'll be</i>
<i>We saw a world</i>
<i>No one ever saw before</i>
<i>It was the world</i>
<i>Love can start</i>
<i>With a beat of a heart</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>I saw stars</i>
<i>Shining in clear blue skies</i>
<i>We flow together</i>
<i>Once and forever</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>One fine night</i>
<i>Love let us see</i>
<i>How far we'll go</i>
<i>How good we'll be</i>
<i>We saw a world</i>
<i>No one ever saw before</i>
<i>It was the world</i>
<i>Love can start</i>
<i>With the beat of a heart</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
<i>Love came for me</i>
