BUMPY: Happy Thanksgiving!
Come here!
Yeah!
MAN: Right here!
MAN: Toss me a bird, Bumpy!
WOMAN 1: Bumpy!
Harlem - 1968
Yeah!
WOMAN 2: Bumpy! We love you!
There you go, darling.
WOMAN 3: Over here! Over here!
Frank! Come on!
Come here.
BUMPY: This is the problem.
This is what's wrong
with America.
It's gotten so big,
you just can't find your way.
The grocery store
on the corner is
now a supermarket.
The candy store
is a McDonald's.
And this place,
a super-fucking
discount store.
Where's the pride
of ownership, huh?
Where's the personal service?
You see what I mean? Shit.
I mean, what right
do they have, of cutting
out the suppliers,
pushing out all the middlemen,
buying direct
from the manufacturer?
Sony this, Toshiba that.
All them Chinks
putting Americans
out of work.
That's the way it is now.
You all right?
You can't find
the heart of anything
to stick the knife.
Hey!
Anybody here?
Can I help you?
Call an ambulance.
Forget it, Frank.
There's no one in charge.
Call an ambulance!
REPORTER: Some say
Bumpy Johnson was a great man,
according to the eulogies,
a giving man,
a man of the people.
No one chose to use
in their remembrances
the word most often
associated with
Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson,
"gangster,"
whose passing has brought
a who's who of mourners
on this chilly afternoon.
Lucchese mob boss
Dominic Cattano,
Harlem crime figure
Nicky Barnes.
MAN: Nicky! Nicky!
REPORTER: From the
political arena,
the Governor has come down,
the Mayor of New York,
and Chief of Police and
Commissioner, sports and
entertainment luminaries.
REPORTER 2.; Bumpy Johnson,
age 62 when he passed,
was a folk hero among
Harlem locals for
over four decades.
Regarded by some
as the Robin Hood of Harlem,
by others as
a ruthless criminal...
TANGO: I don't understand,
you know.
I would've thought that
Bumpy would put out
a better spread, you know?
You want something?
No, thanks.
I want chicken wings
at my funeral.
MAN: All right, Nicky Barnes.
NICKY: Who is that?
He didn't know what hit him,
you know what I'm saying?
I just kept popping him
in the face 'Cause
that's what I do.
I don't have a lighter.
You have a light?
FRANK: Okay?
TANGO: That's very good.
Hey, Frank.
Go get me a light
while you're at it.
Appreciate it.
Don Cattano.
Hey, how you doing, Rossi?
Good.
BARTENDER: Would you
like a drink, sir?
Give him a scotch
on the rocks.
Come on. Come on.
I know you're hurting, Frank.
So am I.
I'm all right.
You gonna be all right?
Yeah.
I'm sure Bumpy didn't say
anything to you, but
he made me promise
that if anything
ever happened to him,
that I should make sure
that you want for nothing.
I appreciate that.
You know, half the people
in this room owed
Bumpy money when he died.
They think I'm gonna forget
to collect, but I'm gonna
get that money.
Well, that's the spirit.
Go get 'em.
PROFESSOR: Mr. Roberts,
taking the prosecution's side,
give us US v. Mead,
subject, issues,
what the determination was
and what it means to us today.
Class, you'll be critiquing
Mr. Roberts, so pay attention.
RICHIE. ; I hate hearing
my name called, you know?
It means I gotta get up
in front of the class,
I gotta turn around,
and I know every one of
those people there,
they know more than I do.
The number one fear of people,
it ain't dying,
it's public speaking.
I get physically ill,
I wanna throw up.
And that's what you
wanna do for a living.
No, I don't wanna be
like that, man,
I wanna beat it.
JAY: So, should I do this?
No, he'll take it from me,
he knows me. I've known
him since high school.
From high school?
Good morning. Yeah.
He doesn't take it,
just throw it in.
It's good service.
Throw it in? All right.
Yeah.
JAY: What's up, Susie?
Hey, Jay.
How you doing, baby?
All right.
All right. Ready?
Hey! That's his head!
RICHIE: You're supposed
to be my friend, asshole!
CAMPIZl: I swear
to God, Richie, I
didn't know it was you.
I would never slam a door
on your hand, knowingly.
You bit my fucking hand.
What are you doing
serving subpoenas, anyway?
JAY: We're on loan to County.
County?
How's that working
out for you?
RICHIE: Hey, fuck you.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Consider me served.
Can we leave it there?
Assault on a police officer?
I don't think so.
Hey, for old times' sake.
What can we do?
What do you want?
What can I give you?
What do you get for assault
with a deadly weapon, Jay?
Five years minimum.
RICHIE: Five years.
Guys, come on. No, guys.
What do you want?
Who do you want?
Who do you got?
You want Big Al's bookie?
You want his accountant?
I'll give him to you.
[New Jersey]
CAMPIZl: Stop, stop, stop.
There he is.
That's him.
That's the bookie.
RICHIE: All right,
Carlo, get lost.
Get out of the car.
CAMPIZl: This is...
I'd rather not.
JAY: Come on. Let's go.
Take it ease.
JAY: Want to stay with him
or the car?
Let's see who comes
for the car.
Think he made us?
You called in the warrants,
right? So, where are they?
I just called, man.
I called and walked back here
and 10 seconds has gone by.
I saw him with the slips, Jay.
You saw policy slips?
You saw grocery bags.
You don't know what's in 'em.
Yes, I do and so do you.
Don't give me that bull.
What's the rush, Richie?
Half an hour,
the warrant will be here.
I got night school, all right?
Guess you're gonna miss it.
RICHIE: Fuck this. Come on.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure. Let's go.
Fuck.
Jay.
Yeah?
Fuck.
MAN ON RADIO. ;
WBZ, honey bunch,
the show they all love!
It's the groovy sound
of the Jefferson Kaye
Saturday Night Show.
Dig, honey, it's
coming up time for news.
Jumping on the ceiling,
wallpaper peeling on WBZ.
Stick around,
the Jace-man's got 10.
Back in 10.
It's not just a
couple of bucks, all right?
It's the same thing
in principle.
Oh, are we talking principles?
Richie, a cop who turns
in this kind of money,
says one thing.
He turns in cops
who take money.
We'll be fucking pariahs.
Yeah, well, then
we're fucked both ways.
Not if we keep it.
Only if we don't, then
you're right, we're fucked.
But not if we keep it.
God damn it, man!
Did we ask for this?
Did we put a gun to
someone's head and say,
"Give us your money"?
Cops kill cops
they can't trust.
We can't turn it in, man.
Can you believe that?
How much is it?
$987,000.
Well, what happened
to the rest of it?
TOBACK: What the hell
are you doing
counting it out here
in front of everybody?
Are you nuts?
Get it back in the bags,
seal them up and down
into the property room.
DETECTIVE:
You fucking Boy Scout.
What? What?
[New York City Police Plaza]
Detective Trupo, sign here.
TRUPO: You guys ready to make
a lot of fucking money?
MAN 1: Always.
MAN 2: Hell, yeah.
TRUPO: Fucking A.
TRUPO: Oh, look at this.
There you go.
TRUPO: All right,
look at this.
MAN 2: Fucking beautiful.
There's three more boats.
TRUPO: Hey, don't lose
any of that shit.
MAN 1: I know.
TRUPO: All right, be careful.
Hey! Just enough for
the reagent test.
A little less.
ROSSI. ; This is the
French Connection dope.
Kilos of the same dope
Eddie Egan and
Sonny Grosso took from us.
The cops seize it,
arrest everyone,
then they start taking it out
of the evidence room,
whacking it down to nothing
and selling it back to us.
They basically control
the market with it.
Mr. Rossi,
I have a surprise for you.
ROSSI. ; They've been doing it
for years now. They
live off it, our dope.
What do you think?
What the fuck is happening
to the world, Frank?
Those fucking crooks.
Yeah. Sad about Bumpy.
Things are never gonna
be the same in Harlem.
You walk down the street,
nobody bothers you 'Cause
Bumpy was making sure of it.
Half a key.
How is your day now?
It's chaos.
Every gorilla for hisself.
Motherfucker!
Who can live like that?
There has to be order.
That would never
happen with Italians.
More important than
any one man's life,
is order.
Frank.
Hey. Come on in,
Claude. Sit down.
FRANK: How y'all doing, huh?
Good.
So, you see Nate over there?
Yeah?
MAN: Yeah, all the time.
Nate is everywhere. He's good.
Yeah.
He's still over there?
Yeah. He's got himself
a club now.
Okay. Whereabouts, Saigon?
MAN: Bangkok.
Bangkok? I don, t think he, s
ever coming home.
Come on.
On the house,
for our boys in uniform.
Thank you, sugar.
That's very kind.
REDTOP: Thank Frank.
Thanks, Frank.
Just relax.
You have to boot
this shit a couple of times.
The cops keep cutting it,
selling the shit.
I don't want to say anything,
'Cause the price is right,
but that shit in Nam is way,
way heavy.
Did you ain't seen
the jar, Frank, hmm?
I think you walked
right past it.
The money jar, Frank.
What do I gotta do,
put a fucking sign on it?
Hmm?
Look at this nigger
right here. You know, Frank,
Bumpy don't own 116th no more.
Bumpy don't own
no real estate in
Harlem right now.
I'm the landlord
and the lease is 20%.
Look, don't sell dope then,
Frank. Get a real job.
You need a fucking job, Frank?
Hmm? Is that what you need?
Well, you can
come work for me.
Okay? You can drive me around,
huh? You can open my doors.
Huh? "Yes, sir", "No, sir",
"Right away, sir", " Anything
you want, Massa Johnson".
Twenty percent.
Twenty percent
is my profit, Tango.
If I give you that,
then what do I got left?
Nothing, man.
Twenty percent puts
me out of business,
and every somebody
you know out of business.
There's legitimate ways of
doing things, Tango,
and then there's this way.
Not even Bumpy took 20%.
Bumpy's fucking dead.
My man.
Twenty percent?
Twenty percent.
Doc, let's go.
Out. Good job. Sit.
A leader, like a shepherd,
he sends his fastest
nimble sheep, out front.
And the others will follow.
While the shepherd,
he walks quietly behind it.
Here, boy!
Here we go. Right here.
Bring it here. Yeah.
Now he's got the stick,
and the cane,
he'll use it!
If he has to.
But most times
he doesn't have to.
He moves the whole
herd quietly.
What right do they have
cutting out the supplier?
The middleman.
Buying direct.
Putting Americans
out of work.
That's the way
it is now, Frank.
That's the way it is.
MAN 1 ON TV. ;
The drug problem in Vietnam
is more than marijuana.
At this point, it is
estimated that one third
of American troops
are experimenting
with opium and heroin.
MAN 2 ON TV. ;
The authorities say
they have confiscated
large quantities of marijuana,
heroin and pills.
Every person
and every vehicle
going through the gates
is subject to
a thorough shakedown.
MAN 3 ON TV. ; Soldiers have
access to the drugs at
many rest and relaxation spots
in Bangkok, Saigon and
other areas throughout
Vietnam and Thailand.
Officials say the easy
availability, relatively
cheap cost
and high purity of heroin
throughout Saigon
and the Far East,
is leading to an epidemic
of heroin addiction
among US soldiers.
Operator.
FRANK: Yeah, international.
What city?
Bangkok.
You know the country code?
Yeah, 376.
For the first three minutes,
it'll be...
I got it, I got it. I got it.
Hello?
Soul Brothers.
Hey, can I help you?
Nate.
Do I know you?
Yeah, it's me.
Your cousin, negro.
Go on, get yourself
a new suit.
Look, I'm sorry.
Oh, please, Richie.
It couldn't be avoided.
I'll take him next weekend,
all right?
We're moving.
What? Where?
The St. Regis.
What do you care?
To my sister's.
Your sister's? In Vegas?
Yeah.
You are not moving
to Las Vegas.
Not with Michael, anyway.
What am I supposed
to do with him, leave him
with you? There's a picture.
Hey, guys! Be cool.
Laurie, Las Vegas is not
the kind of place
that you raise a kid.
Oh, like this is a
good environment?
And around your friends?
When am I supposed
to see my boy?
This weekend.
Last weekend.
God damn it.
Hey! I asked you nice
to shut up, right?
Now I'm gonna
have to kill you.
I swear I will pull out
my gun and put a bullet
in your fucking heads!
Now stop what you're doing
and pick up the glass!
Calm down, man.
Okay, be cool.
Fucking crazy, man.
You don't have a gun.
You sure?
You are crazy, Richie.
You don't have room for us.
I'll see you in court.
Come on, Michael.
Say bye to your dad.
Get over here.
Hey, kiddo.
I'll see you next week,
all right? We'll do something.
LAURIE: Let's get you
an ice cream.
You have 10 minutes
remaining. Ten minutes.
[Bangkok]
MAN: Shake it, baby.
Shake it, shake it, shake it.
MAN: Oh, come on, girl.
Don't tell me $5 don't get
me a little something.
GIRL: Can you dig
that it costs money
to be here?
MAN: Oh, come on, girl.
He said "a lot".
Is he your cousin?
Yes... He is.
He's my ex-wife's cousin.
Ask him how much he wants.
How much you want, Frank?
Tell him I want 100 keys.
NATE: Frank, ain't nobody
I know can get you that
much personally, all right?
You're gonna have to
piece it together from
several sources,
and it's not gonna
be 100% pure.
I don't want that.
I know what you
don't want, Frank,
but look, what you're
gonna need is to get
to the Chiu-Chou syndicate,
all right?
Cholon, Saigon.
If they're gonna
deal with you at all.
I understand that,
but by then it's gonna
be too late.
It'll be already chopped up.
I wanna go get it where
they go get it from.
I wanna go to the source.
So, you're gonna
go get it yourself?
Why not?
Huh? I came this far.
You're gonna go
into the motherfucking jungle?
I'm in the jungle.
Look around.
They're eating these roaches
and whatever that is.
Nigga, I'm talking
about snakes, all right?
I'm talking about tigers,
I'm talking about Vietcong,
I'm talking about mosquitoes
that'll fucking kill your ass.
You wanna go into the jungle?
We're going.
Fuck it. Let's go.
We're going.
Why not?
Let's go.
Hey, Frank.
This whole spot's locked down
by the Kuomintang,
General Chiang Kai-shek's
defeated army.
How would you get
it into the States?
You ain't got to
worry about that.
Who do you work
for in there?
You ain't got to worry
about that, either.
Who are you, really?
Frank Lucas,
says it right there
in my passport.
I mean, who you represent?
Me.
You think you're going
to take 100 kilos of
heroin into the US,
and you don't work for anyone?
Someone is going
to allow that?
That's right.
He must be insane.
After this first purchase,
if you are not killed
by Marseille importers,
or their people in the States,
then what?
Then there will be more,
much more, I guarantee it.
And if it's all the same
to you, I don't wanna have to
drag my ass up here no more.
Of course not.
My man.
Soul brother, huh?
Soul brother.
Fifty grand. It's gonna cover
them and the pilot and
the boys on the other end.
Give them a hundred.
Fifty is gonna
cover it, Frank.
Give them a hundred,
give them the
whole thing. Here.
And look,
that's all I got.
So, if that dope don't arrive
for any reason...
Hey, listen, cousin or
no cousin, I'm
a busy man, all right?
I ain't got no time
to be going
to nobody's funeral.
I'll let you know
when it's in the air.
My man.
Fuck.
JAY. ; Richie?
Yeah.
This fucking guy made me.
I don't know how he did,
but he did.
He went for his gun.
I had to do it, man.
There's 100 people
out there that heard
the shots.
You gotta help me.
You gotta do something.
WOMAN: Baby.
Where are you, Jay?
That's the problem.
Dispatch, I got a 10-13.
I got a 10-13.
Copy that. What's your 20?
Tower two.
Apartment 1G.
Kent and West in the projects.
Identify yourself, please.
Detective Richie Roberts.
That's a negative.
I got no units in that area.
Bullshit.
Please put the call out again.
I'm gonna need assistance.
Detective Roberts,
I got no units in that area.
That's a negative.
I didn't mention no cops.
Know what I'm saying?
You know what I'm saying?
MAN 1: I'll get
the motherfucker!
Kick his ass!
MAN 2: Yo, cracker,
you gonna pay for this shit!
MAN 3: Where the fuck
you going? Where
the fuck you going?
What you gonna do,
motherfucker?
Hey, hey, be cool.
Be cool, all right?
I'll find out what's
going on in here.
JAY: Richie.
MAN: Open the door!
Open the motherfucking door!
PARAMEDIC:
Where's your backup?
MAN: You
motherfucking cracker!
You got no backup?
Why is that?
MAN: You gotta come
out sometime, motherfucker!
Bandage his neck.
Richie, he's dead.
I know he's
fucking dead, right.
Bandage his neck,
clean up his head,
prop him up on the gurney
so he's sitting and
open his fucking eyes.
MAN: Open this fucking door!
All right? Let's go.
PARAMEDIC: Fuck.
All right, clean him up.
PARAMEDIC 2: Okay.
Where's the solution?
RICHIE: Hey.
Huh?
MAN: God damn it,
open this fucking door!
Give me your gun.
What?
Give me your gun.
MAN: Get your punk ass
out here, man!
You have your badge?
Yeah.
MAN: I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!
You guys ready?
Uh-huh.
Okay. Just keep
moving forward.
You all right?
Yeah.
It's okay! It's okay!
We're taking him
to the hospital.
Everybody, step back!
Step back!
He's all right.
He's okay.
We're taking care of him.
Step back. Step back.
Everything's fine.
Just stand back.
He's all right.
He's alive.
WOMAN: What happened inside?
RICHIE: We're taking him
to the hospital.
JAY: Thanks, man.
Fuck.
That asshole pulled
a piece on me, man.
Can you fucking believe it?
He pulls a piece on a cop?
I had to do it, man.
Kill or be killed.
Fucking crazy world, right?
What the fuck were you
doing in the projects?
Investigating stuff,
man, you know,
just like you taught me.
Checking on guys,
following things up,
putting the pieces together.
That guy was a dealer.
A fucking dealer.
Scum of the earth.
That guy didn't pull
a gun on a cop, Jay.
That guy pulled a gun
on a junkie,
a junkie who was
trying to rob him.
What the fuck you say?
What the fuck, man?
What are you doing, man?
What the fuck is that?
That's my fucking money, man!
I earned this shit.
That's mine!
I earned it doing
good cop work!
What the fuck is this?
Good cop work!
You murdered a guy!
I earned it getting shot at!
You murdered a guy!
You murdered him,
you robbed his money,
then you called me
to get you out of it.
That makes me an accessory
after the fact, motherfucker.
I'll tell you the facts, man.
Just write the report
the way I say it happened,
and then that's the way it is,
and that's how it will be.
I can't do that.
I'm a leper because
I listened to you and
turned in a million bucks.
No one will work
with me after that.
I can get off this shit,
Richie. That's easy.
Just write the report
between us, as partners.
I can't do that.
Hey!
Stop! Stop!
Fuck!
Open the trunk.
PEOPLE ON TV. Peace now!
Peace now! Peace now!
LBJ, how many kids
did you kill today?
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!
Get out, get out,
get out of Vietnam!
MAN ON TV. ;... as loud as
we can that the Vietnam War
should stop,
and that the best way
to stop it is for
the United States
to simply pack up
and get out of
Vietnam right now.
FRANK: How we looking?
Typically, what I see is
25% to 45% pure.
I mean, there's
no adulterants, no alkaloids,
no dilutants.
It's 100%.
May I?
Take it with you.
Thank you, Frank.
I'll take it.
No contingencies,
no loans, no nothing.
Cash.
Fabulous.
I'm not talking about
your proclivities, Richie.
Those I only know too well.
I'm talking about being a cop.
RICHIE: You're talking
about taking money?
I don't do that.
It's not my thing.
What about your friends
from the neighborhood?
Do you still hang out
with them?
Yeah.
Play baseball
on the weekends.
Wise guys?
That's gonna look good.
Guys I went to
high school with.
So what?
What about Joseph Sodano?
What about him?
Richie, I'm just trying
to understand things
your wife has said.
If they're not true, tell me.
Yeah, he's one of them.
Is he also your
son's godfather?
Yeah.
He's definitely fucking her.
Do you really care about this?
Or do you just not
want her to win ever?
You know, there's
an interview room
on the second floor.
That's what I thought.
The door only locks
from the inside.
All rise.
Oh, God, Richie.
Richie, fuck me like a cop,
not a lawyer!
SHEILA: Don't answer it!
Yeah?
Richie Roberts.
Hey, Norm?
Hey. Richie Roberts.
Hi. Detective Norman Reily.
Hey, Norm. How are you?
Good.
So, is that him?
Yeah.
Picked a nice night to
come out, huh? It's like
Grand Central around here.
It's been like this.
I'm lucky if I get home
by midnight. It's like
nothing we've seen before.
Something I gotta sign?
REILY: Yeah. It's right here.
I'm taking this with me.
I'll register it with
Essex County, all right?
REILY: All right.
America's public enemy
number one in the
United States is drug abuse.
In order to fight and
defeat this enemy,
it is necessary to wage a new,
all-out offensive.
REPORTER. ; Federal authorities
have announced their intention
to establish special
narcotics bureaus
in Washington, New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago...
A detective without
the support of his
fellow detectives
really can't do much.
You know why I don't have it.
Doesn't matter.
You did what you had to do.
Greatest city in the world!
And it's turning into
an open sewer.
Everybody's stealing, dealing.
Look at you.
You can't work because
you did your job.
Good news is,
you're not the only
honest cop in town.
The special narcotics bureau
in Washington is not
a dog and pony show.
They are sincere. I know
this because they want
us to orchestrate it.
And I want you to
head up things
here on our end.
If it's federal,
who do I answer to,
the post office?
No, you answer to me,
me and the US Attorney,
nobody else.
You never step foot
in a police station again.
You work out of
your own place, you pick
your own guys,
guys that you know
would not take a nickel
off the sidewalk.
Well, we got
the lovely transit.
600-year-old
mahogany doors.
Now, look at that.
Can't you just feel it?
I think it's lovely.
Watch your step.
Look at these
beautiful floors.
At least, I don't know,
200 years old.
And it's hard to
get the cracks...
Now this was one of
my favorite rooms
but we had some
problems with
the plumbing.
I even fixed it.
I know it works.
It's not gonna leak.
Here it is.
You know, I used to be a really good piano player
when I was a kid,
but then, I don't
know why I forgot.
Life goes on. Well...
How long are
you gonna be?
Oh, and do me
a favor, please.
Mind the doors.
Those are beautiful,
ornate glass doors,
you know.
Here we go, Jimmy.
Come on.
Oh, yeah. Give it back.
[Greensboro, N.C.]

Yeah, who this?
Who you think it is, boy?

Frank who?
Frank your brother, negro.
Frankie?
That's right.
Hey, Melvin!
Melvin, where's Ma?
What?
Frank's on the phone!
MELVIN: Hey, Ma!
How are you doing, Frankie?
Frank's on the phone!
Say what?
Mama, Frank's on the phone!
Frank? Oh, my Lord!
Yeah, when?
Well, you just say it,
man, yeah.
Listen, I'm gonna
call y'all back
at 6:00. I want you to get
everybody together, all right?
Get Mama, get everybody.
All right?
Okay.
MRS. LUCAS: Hey, Frank!
What's happening, Frank?
Hey, Frankie.
How you doing, Uncle Frank?
TERRENCE: Get out the car.
Get the kids, get the kids.
Look at this, baby.
(LAUGHING) Oh, my Lord!
I'm so glad to see you, boy.
Oh, I'm telling you,
this is some piece of land
you got here!
FRANK: I wonder what
the poor people
are doing here?
MRS. LUCAS: And whose
house is that, Frankie?
That is your house, Mama.
Mine?
That's yours.
And who else?
BOY: Now, there, that's
my room right there, man.
Right over there.
Anybody want some
more collard greens?
I wanna tell you how happy
I am to see all my
children at the table
and the grandchildren
at the same time.
My heart's so happy.
Enjoy yourselves.
Right on, Grandma.
I hope you got a job, boy,
the way you're eating
over here.
That boy right there,
he got a arm on him. I mean,
a major league arm.
Oh, yeah?
Ain't that right?
Right on, Pop.
Well, we'll see after dinner.
We'll see him throw
it around a little bit.
No, no, you can't
catch him, man.
I'm talking about...
I'm talking about...
This guy throw harder
than Gibson.
We're talking
95 miles an hour.
Can you catch him?
He gonna...
He gonna catch the ground.
We might've played catch,
I think, when I was
about five years old.
Since then, he ain't been
able to keep up.
This is your room.
It's perfect.
Oh. Why, it's...
Will you look at this?
Oh!
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful. It's just...
I...
How did you...
I had it made.
From memory.
You were five when
they took it away on me.
That's right.
How could you remember it?
How could I forget, Mama?
(STAMMERING) I'll just
tell you it is perfect.
It's all perfect.
I can't tell you
how much I love you.
I love you, too, Mama.
It's okay.
SPEARMAN: Both these guys,
good with wires,
they got solid informants,
and they're honest
and they're fearless.
They're insane,
Richie, like you.
Where are they?
That's Jones with
the skinny white broad.
Best I ever seen
on the street.
He knows dope,
but he's together,
all right?
He's a stand-up
guy all round.
And that's Abruzzo
with the two fat black ones.
He loves a big ass, man.
He's a bulldog. He don't
fuck around, all right.
He's got a bit of a temper,
yeah, but you can trust
this guy with your
grandmother.
Listen, Richie.
We work together.
You want me,
you gotta take them, too.
When do we start?
The man I worked for,
he had one of the biggest
companies in New York City.
He ran it for more
than 50 years.
Fifteen years,
eight months and
nine days,
I was with him every day.
I worked for him,
I protected him,
I looked after him,
I learned from him.
Bumpy was rich,
but he wasn't white man rich,
you see?
He wasn't wealthy.
He didn't own his own company.
He thought he did,
but he didn't,
he just managed it.
The white man owned it,
so they owned him.
Nobody owns me, though.
Hey.
How you doing, babe?
Good.
That's 'Cause I own
my own company, and
my company sells a product
that's better than
the competition,
at a price that's lower
than the competition.
Well, what are
we selling here, Frank?
How you doing, Red?
These are my brothers,
just got here from
North Carolina.
Everybody, this is Redtop.
Hello.
How you doing?
FRANK: And the ladies.
LADIES: Hey.
What wrong? Y'all niggas ain't
never seen hoochie before?
TURNER: Why are
they all naked?
FRANK: So they
can't steal nothing.
Oh, right.
The most important thing
in business is honesty,
integrity, hard work,
family,
never forgetting
where we came from.
Thank you, Charlene.
See, you are what
you are in this world,
that's either one
of two things.
Either you're somebody,
or you're nobody.
Be right back.
I need these fresh.
'Cause if I have to come
back here and get you,
you know what it is.
FRANK: Tango.
Don't y'all play that.
VENDOR 1: Yes, sir,
I hear you.
You won't have to come back.
There won't be no problem.
VENDOR 2: What about you,
Frank? You need anything?
Where's my money?
Redtop gave you the package.
You're supposed to be
handing me my money.
Here's a jar right here.
Twenty percent.
Oh, you got the jar?
That's right.
Get the fuck out of here...
Oh! What you gonna do?
What the fuck you
gonna do, Frank? Huh?
What you doing?
You gonna shoot me in front of
everybody? Huh? Come on.
Shit.
There you go.
Twenty percent.
So, what was I saying?
Jones.
Jonesy.
That was nice, man.
Just doing my
melodious thing,
baby.
Got you.
This is the newly formed
Essex County Narcotics Squad.
Our mandate is to
make major arrests.
No street guys.
We're looking for
the suppliers and
the distributors.
Heroin, cocaine, amphetamines.
No grass under 1,000 pounds.
No powder under 40 kilograms.
Any less than that,
then somebody else
can waste their time.
We gonna be handling the
big shipments, the big money
and the big temptation.
JONES: I heard
a story about you.
That you found
a million dollars in
unmarked cash
and gave that shit back.
Is that true?
Yeah, I did.
Anybody got a
problem with that?
So do I, you know?
I think about it every day.
I should be down in South
Florida with a 68-foot cruiser
doing fishing charters.
MAN: You and me, both.
But you know,
I didn't, so here I am,
and we'll be looking to land
other kind of sharks.
All right?
ABRUZZO: Bingo.
JONES: See that, Richie?
Yeah.
And this stuff is
your everyday stuff.
But this Blue Magic,
twice the potency.
I mean, it's the purest thing
I ever seen in the streets.
It's strong enough to smoke.
And that's for those
white suburban kids who
are scared of needles.
ABRUZZO: I paid 10
bucks for that.
And it's everywhere.
I mean, it's on every
corner out there.
So, how is that possible?
Who can afford to sell
shit twice as good
for half as much?
Hey, man. Frankie,
baby, good to see you!
Everything's good?
Yeah, man, just got back
from Europe,
over there for two months,
south of France, man.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Look right, look right.
Wonderful, wonderful.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Nicky!
PHOTOGRAPHER 3:
Give us a smile, Nicky.
PHOTOGRAPHER 4:
Show us the cover.
You know what
I'm saying, man?
PHOTOGRAPHER 5:
Hey, Nicky, over here.
There you go.
Nicky!
Who is that?
Look at you, my man.
All right.
LEAD SINGER. ;
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Brown Bomber! The champ!
Mr. Joe Louis!
Who's that with Joe?
Miss Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico?
Mmm-hmm.
Is she a beauty queen?
For real. The beauty queen.
Welcome.
My main man. My main man.
Can you all excuse us
for a minute, please?
MAN: Yeah, sure, Frank.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
What's going on?
What you smiling about?
I don't know.
What is this? Huh?
What's what?
What's what?
Come here.
What is that you got on?
What's what, man?
Yeah, that! What you got on.
This is a very,
very, very nice suit.
That's a very, very, very
nice suit, huh? That's a clown
suit. That's a costume...
that says "Arrest Me."
You understand?
You're too loud.
You're making too much noise.
Look at me.
The loudest one in the room
is the weakest one
in the room. I told you that.
All right? What, are you
trying to be like
Nicky Barnes, now?
What's your problem with
Nicky, man? I like Nicky.
I ain't got no problem
with Nicky. Oh,
you like Nicky?
Yeah!
You want to be like Nicky?
You want to be superfly?
You wanna work for him?
Share a jail cell with him?
Maybe cook for him?
He wants to talk to you.
Oh, so now you talking
to him about me?
What? You...
About what? What is it about?
It ain't like that.
Then what is it like?
We were talking,
your name came up.
About what?
I don't know, man.
I told him I'd tell you.
You know... Boy, you...
You know, if you wasn't
my brother, I'd kill you.
You know that, don't you?
I'd blow your
motherfucking brains out.
Come on, man.
Don't be like that.
I'm taking you
shopping this week.
I went shopping.
I can tell.
It's a tax thing.
It's a mistake my lawyers
are straightening out,
but for the time being...
How much do
you owe, Joe?
It's nothing.
It's like...
Fifty grand.
You got it.
Thank you, man.
Hey, I'm gonna pay
you back as soon as I...
Joe, this ain't no loan.
It's a gift. All right?
All you did for Bumpy,
we owe you.
Keep your chin up.
All right? Okay?
All you have which
is down there. Down.
Chin down.
All right. Doc, will
see you, okay?
Hey!
You still owe me
that dance, right?
FRANK: Doc, come on.
Frank, check this.
How you doing?
Hi.
Frank Lucas.
Eva Kendo.
Nice to meet you, Eva.
Nice to meet you,
Frank.
You're Frank and
this is your place?
That's right.
I'm Frank and
this is my place.
Why is it called
Small's?
Why don't you
call it Frank's?
When you own something,
you can call it
what you want.
Small's.
Or Frank's.
Frankie Small's.
Small's Frankie.
That's right.
You want to let
my hand go?
Okay.
You leaving?
No, I was going
to my table.
Okay. Need somebody
to go with you?
Yes?
EVA: Mmm-hmm.
SPEARMAN: All the cheesies.
Right here, here we go.
What have we got here?
ABRUZZO: Wash your hands?
I got one print of that,
don't smudge it.
MAN: Yeah.
There you go.
JONES: Hey, Spearman,
what about him?
Who is that?
Joey Sodano.
Don Cattano's nephew.
SPEARMAN: Yeah, yeah. Put him
up there by the big man.
JONES: He looks
like your uncle, Abruzzo.
Yeah, but he's not
as handsome.
JONES: He looks more
like your sister.
MAN: Where's Ice Pick's mug?
ABRUZZO: Yeah, that's funny.
Maybe you guys
should take that show
on the road.
So we need Ice Pick Paul.
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul?
JONES: Yeah.
SPEARMAN: There you go.
Get him up.
ABRUZZO: Ice Pick Paul,
he goes way up there, up top.
No, Ice Pick Paul,
he's a fucking soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.
How's that even
fucking possible?
JONES: That's Benny
the Bishop.
That guy is a soldier.
This guy's a lieutenant.
No way that guy's on top.
JONES: You thinking of
Benny the Bishop.
Vinnie Two Socks is fucking
Cattano's deadbeat son-in-law.
SPEARMAN: Jonesy's right.
Hey, which one of you guys
has ever actually seen
Ice Pick Paul selling drugs?
Actually seen it go down?
Yeah, seen it go down.
Been in his place.
Seen him handle drugs.
That rat, Ricky,
has told us...
He's fucking dead.
About four weeks ago.
He's dead.
SPEARMAN: (LAUGHING)
All right, well,
we can take him off
the fucking board.
I don't think we got
any solid evidence on
anybody on that board.
What you saying, Richie?
This is weeks and
weeks of work, man.
I'm saying, take it down.
We got to start again
from the street.
Hi, who's this?
Hello? Gabe?
Yeah, it's Scott.
Yeah.
Scotty! What's going
down, brother?
Those snow tires you
gave me last night.
They come in yet?
Oh, the snow tires?
Yeah. I want some
more of them.
Give me one-and-a-half
more.
One-and-a-half,
that's a pretty big order.
Yeah, I want the
big whitewalls,
they better get at least
100,000 miles.
All right,
I'll tell you what.
You come in here
tomorrow morning
I'm gonna set
you up real nice
with a whitewall special,
all right?
Thanks, bro.
No problem.
That's considerably
more than one year's
salary, Richie.
If it disappears,
I will not be able to
get it for you again.
That's yours.
Signing my life away again,
for a lousy twenty grand.
It has to be
Blue Magic, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's gonna be Blue.
You can pick it up
here tomorrow.
RICHIE: $20,000.
MECHANIC: Just leave it there.
How'd you do?
Good.
RICHIE: Here he comes.
That's him?
Yep.
That was quick.
Richie, if he goes
in the city, what
do we fucking do?
Stay with the fucking money,
that's what we do.
We stay with the money,
all right?
We can't go
in the fucking city.
Yes, we can.
That's 20 grand
in there, all right,
that I'm responsible for.
I ain't losing it.
SPEARMAN: It's out
of our jurisdiction!
RICHIE: Follow the money!
SPEARMAN: All right,
all right, all right!
RICHIE: He's pulling over.
SPEARMAN:
All right, here we go.
RICHIE: Let me out here.
RICHIE:
Don't disappear, all right?
I'll circle the block.
DRIVER: Move!
Hey! Who's the fuck?
You gotta fucking move!
Police Officer.
I'm commandeering
your vehicle.
Get out of the car.
Who the fuck cares
about you? This is
New York City, man.
Get someone else's car!
Get out of the car.
Come on, man.
Can't we live in peace...
Frankie, Frankie! Sit down.
MAN 1: What?
Happy birthday, gentlemen.
How you doing, huh?
He's about to do something,
huh? He's going bowling?
Look at that. Strike.
Hey, what's between your legs?
What's in the bag?
MECHANIC: Nothing.
Get up, you fucker.
Get the fuck up!
MAN 2: Knock it off.
MAN 3:
Shut the fuck up!
What did I tell you?
MAN 4: Keep your
fucking head down.
MAN 3: Shut up!
Whose bag is this?
WOMAN: What're you doing?
MAN 3: Sit down and shut up!
MAN 4: Don't you move!
Hey, guys? Guys! Officers!
Hey, I'm Richie Roberts,
from Newark.
That's my money.
What the fuck?
What money, huh?
What money?
The bills are
sequenced, right?
They're registered with the
Essex County Prosecutor's
Office. Just check them out.
They all start with CF3500.
Have a look.
Fucking registers.
I thought I had a fucking
Chris-Craft sitting
in my driveway.
Honest mistake.
I'll just get the money.
This time.
All right.
There it is.
RICHIE: All right. Thank you.
When was the last time
I was in Jersey? Let me think.
Never.
What're you doing,
coming over here unannounced?
You don't think you could
get hurt doing that?
You got your fucking
money, Richie.
And never, ever
come into this city
again unannounced.
You come in to see
a fucking Broadway show,
you call ahead first,
see if it's okay with me.
No problem. All right.
MAN:
Let's go, hit some balls.
RICHIE: Great suits, pal.
Is that your car?
That's a fucking
great car.
Have a nice fucking
trip back to Jersey.
RICHIE: All right.
Come on, I got
a tee time.
Let's go.
What were you doin' there?
Well, that's where this
dope is coming from.
Blue Magic, it's coming
out of New York.
What do you expect
me to do, ignore it?
The cab driver has
filed aggravated assault
and grand theft charges
which he may reconsider
depending on how much
the State of New Jersey
offers to settle.
I showed him my ID.
I told him I was a cop.
You stole his cab
and you knock him out.
I was chasing
the 20 grand,
all right?
Next time, knock him out
before you show
him your badge.
Look, I don't want to
hear about you going
into New York again.
Well, then this
investigation's over.
You're not
listening to me.
I said, " I don't want
to hear about you going
into New York again."
You do whatever
you have to do.
You go wherever
you have to go
to figure out
who's bringing this
shit into the country.
Just don't tell me
about it.
FRANK: There's your girl,
right there.
Hey, how'd you do?
Hi.
I didn't keep you
waiting long, did I?
No. Fine.
Good. A woman
as beautiful as you
shouldn't have to wait.
For anything.
Thank you, ma'am.
You as pretty as ever.
Hey, Doc.
Tommy!
Heard your boy scored
two touchdowns last week.
Sure. Sure do make
father proud.
All right.
This is your father?
That's Martin Luther King.
It is not. It is.
It is Martin Luther King.
You know, "I have a dream"?
Of course.
No, that's...
He was just as important
as Martin Luther King to me.
What did he do?
A lot of things.
He was a friend
and served New York.
New York served him.
He was my boss.
My teacher.
What did he teach you?
He taught me a
lot of things. He
taught me how to take my time.
Taught me that if I was
going to do something,
to do it with care, with love.
Anything else?
He taught me
to be a gentleman.
That's what you are?
That's what I try to be.
Come here.
Come here. Sit right here.
Look at me.
I own about five apartments
in Manhattan.
Homes all over the East Coast,
I could have taken you to
any one of them, but I didn't.
I brought you here.
MRS. LUCAS: Frank,
I was looking for you, boy.
Because I wanted you
to meet my mother.
How you doing, Ma?
Is this her?
Eva, this is my mother.
EVA: Hi, Eva.
Oh!
Nice to meet you.
She's beautiful!
FRANK: Yeah?
Look at her, Frank.
She's an angel come
down from heaven.
EVA: Thank you.
Mr. Roberts? I'm here
for our appointment.
Morning.
Morning.
Sorry. Our appointment?
Child Social Services.
She did mention
your name, though.
The stewardess?
No, not the stewardess.
The lady from Child Services.
She mentioned your name.
Right after she asked me
if I associated with
any criminals.
BOY 1: All right, go! Go, go!
BOY 2: Yeah!
You wanna see this?
RICHIE: Hey, boys.
JOEY: Joey. Hey, Joey!
Get in the pool. Go on.
Come on. Come on.
So, how'd she get my name?
Laurie.
Hmm.
She's been saying
a lot lately.
A lot.
You know, when you asked me
to be your son's godfather,
I took it very seriously.
I know. I know and
I appreciate that.
And I said yes,
I would take on
this responsibility.
Take care of your son,
if God forbid, something
happened to you.
Joe, the kind of things
she's saying to
Child Social Services
made me look really bad,
all right. You know,
out at all kinds of hours at
night time, lowlife informants
around, women.
Old friends like me.
Old friends like you, yeah.
Uncle Joey, watch me, okay?
Okay, I understand.
They ask me, I'll tell them
what you want me to tell them.
I'll lie for you.
No, don't lie.
You don't have to lie.
Just, omit certain details.
Sure. All right.
You know, there's something
else I was gonna ask you.
Something else.
You don't have to answer
if you don't want.
Blue Magic. Anything?
Just a lot of sorrow,
misery from guys getting
put out of work, that's all.
What, your guys?
Just guys.
You thinking about
where it's coming from?
Guys down south.
That's all I heard.
Cubans?
I don't know.
Not Mexico.
I don't know.
You're telling me,
it's coming in from
South America?
I don't know.
All I can tell you is whoever
it is, they're upsetting the
natural order of things.
And that's all there is.
What's up?
FRANK ON PHONE. ;
My man, how we looking?
[U.S. Army Base Bien Hoa - Vietnam]
[Fort Bragg - North Carolina]
[Queens]
[Bergen County, N.J.]
[Brooklyn]
[The Bronx]
Frank, I want you to
meet Mike Sobota.
How are you doing, Mr. Sobota?
How are you?
What can I get you?
How about a left-hander?
From what Charlie tells me,
your nephew.
Oh, this is the... Yankees,
yeah. Hey, Steve!
Yankees.
Steve! Come here.
Excuse me one second.
This boy's good, okay?
I want you to put him
on the Yankees.
'Cause you good enough,
ain't you?
I'm a Lucas.
Good enough on
a bad day, Jack.
He's good enough on a bad day,
so don't make it a bad day,
make it a good day,
you understand?
NYPD, excuse me,
Police Department.
Back up, baby.
Whoa!
DETECTIVE: Hey! Hey! Hey!
Taking your ass in, Jimmy.
Uh-uh.
Taking your ass in.
Where are the handcuffs?
I got a license for
that, motherfucker.
You got a license for this?
Excuse me, all right?
Shit. All right! Yeah!
Now, you know what?
I gotta arrest you
for that shit.
That shit's too good
to be on the street.
Wait a minute, I got this
for you. You ain't got
to arrest nobody.
Are you bribing me now?
I'll tell you what,
I'm arresting everybody!
Now, all you're
under arrest! You first!
That's my family.
That's my...
Excuse me, excuse me.
Back it up, baby.
What was that?
Come on, guys.
What's the matter
with you, man?
I said, what the
hell was that?
What was what?
I said what the hell
are you doing, man?
Be cool, man!
What's your fucking problem?
What the hell's
wrong with you?
DETECTIVE: Goddamn!
He's all right.
I just shot him in
the leg, is all.
DETECTIVE: Damn, Jimmy!
Get up.
All right, everybody,
get out! Get out!
HUEY: Come on, Frank,
it was an accident.
FRANK: It wasn't no
goddamn accident.
He feels terrible.
He don't feel shit, 'Cause
he's coked up all
the motherfucking time!
He's your driver.
Get rid of him.
Come on, man,
that's your cousin!
That ain't shit to me!
He don't mean nothing to me.
What's he gonna do,
go back home?
I don't give a damn
what he does!
Send his ass home!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Don't rub on that!
You blot that!
You understand?
That's alpaca!
That's $25,000 alpaca!
You blot that shit!
You don't rub it!
Put the club soda on there.
Simple Simon-ass
motherfuckers.
Listen, from now on,
don't nobody talk to me
directly! You understand?
You got business with me,
you talk to Huey! Huey,
you talk to me! You got it?
All right.
Damn it, never on the phone!
You got it?
I got it.
All right!
And take them goddamn
sunglasses off.
Take the goddamn
sunglasses off!
Damn it, man.
Simple Simon-ass
motherfuckers.
The whole place was imported.
Brick by brick.
Gloucestershire.
Who?
Great Britain.
Yours.
Here you go.
Pull!
Come, Eva.
I'm sure you're dying
to see the rest of the house.
Of course. Excuse me.
Thank you for a wonderful
lunch. It was delicious.
What do you think
of monopolies?
You mean like the game?
No, I just think monopolies
were made illegal in
the country, Frank,
'Cause nobody wants
to compete, you know.
Nobody wants to compete,
not with a monopoly.
I mean, you let the
dairy farmers do that,
half of them would be
out of business tomorrow.
Just trying to make a living.
That's your right, I mean,
it's everyone's right.
It's America.
We just can't do it
at the unreasonable
expense of others.
'Cause then it becomes
un-American.
That's why the price
we pay for that gallon of milk
could never represent
the true cost of production
'Cause it's got to be
controlled. It's gotta be set.
It's gotta be fair.
Gotta be controlled by who?
I set a price that
I think is fair.
I don't think it's fair.
You don't?
I don't think it's fair.
I think it's fair.
I mean, I know
your customers
are happy, Frank,
bunch of fucking
junkies that they are.
But we fellow dairy farmers
out here, Frank,
are you thinking of us?
You thinking of them?
The dairy farmers?
Yeah.
I'm thinking of them, Dominic,
about as much as they've
ever thought about me.
I'm just thinking
out loud now.
If you took some
of your inventory, Frank,
and you sold it wholesale...
Sit.
We could work.
We could do some distribution.
I don't know.
I'm pretty good, Dominic.
You know, I got 110th,
155th, river to river.
I'm all right.
That's kind of a mom
and pop store next to
what I'm talking about.
I mean, let's go at
least bigger than Kmart.
I'm talking about LA,
Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas.
Let's go nationwide, huh?
I'm gonna guarantee you
your peace of mind here.
You don't want that?
You're going to need it.
I don't know how
you view me, you know.
I'm kind of a
Renaissance man, Frank.
You know,
the people I deal with
on a daily basis,
you know, they're not
enlightened, Frank.
You talk to them
about civil rights,
they don't know, you know.
They're not open to change.
Not from the way things
are done and who's doing it.
I talk to them,
there's just no
misunderstandings.
And that's what I mean
by your peace of mind.
You're paying, what,
$75,000, $80,000 a kilo?
I'm a Renaissance man, too.
I'll consider $50,000.
Why would you trust
these people? And the
way they look at you...
They look at me like
it's Christmas
and I'm Santa Claus.
They look at us
like we're the help.
They work for me now.
ALI ON TV. ;
I predict that when
I meet Joe Frazier,
this will be like a
good amateur fighting
a real professional.
This will be like a kid
out of the Olympics...
MAN 1: That's gonna be
Ali in like three.
FRAZIER ON TV. ;
You're not fighting
Oscar Bonavena,
you're not fighting
Sonny Liston.
You're fighting Joe Frazier.
ALI. ; Everybody knows that.
That's not the point.
ABRUZZO: He's all talk, man.
SPEARMAN: Look at Frazier!
JONES: Ali gonna
crush him, baby.
ALI. ; I'll stop him.
FRAZIER. ; Stop me? You?
COSELL. ; How soon? What round?
FRAZIER. ; Don't let him
obligate you.
ALI. ; One to 10!
MAN ON TV. ; Tonight, March 8,
1971. Here we are at
Madison Square Garden
for the Fight of the Century.
And by anybody's definition,
this is a happening.
There are handshakes and,
of course, there are
utterly beautiful women.
But behind the smiles
and behind the handshakes,
you can feel the atmosphere
is so heavy with tension,
it's almost unbearable.
Everybody who is
anybody is here.
Like Sinatra. Like Graziano,
David Frost and
Diahann Carroll.
And Woody Allen and
Diane Keaton. The celebrities
are pouring in.
ALI. ; The way you all build
it up, Life magazine cover,
Time magazine,
everybody gives their opinion.
Dempsey says I'll lose.
Joe Louis...
And when Joe Louis said
I'm gonna lose, that's how
I knew I'd won this one.
Joe Louis always picks
the wrong man!
Always picks the wrong man.
FRAZIER. ; Joe Louis is here
tonight. Watch your ass.
MAN. ; The official weight of
Joe Frazier is 205.5 pounds.
Oh.
ALI. ; Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.
You're not watching
the fight, Bob?
I'm not into boxing.
RICHIE: This ain't
boxing, kid.
It's politics.
I got something for you, too.
FRANK: Yeah?
The coat? For me?
Mmm-hmm.
Do you like it?
The coat? Yeah,
yeah, it's nice.
What do you think?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Over here, Sammy.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2:
Hey, Sammy! Give a look.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Joe Louis! Over here!
How's it going, Frank?
How are you, Joe?
ANNOUNCER. ; Now,
ladies and gentlemen,
we have quite a
list of introductions.
We are now going to
introduce people from
all endeavors of life.
And not just show people.
Because everyone
is here tonight!
Main event!
Fifteen rounds.
For the undisputed
Heavyweight Championship
of the World!
MAN: There we go, Ali!
From Louisville, Kentucky,
he's wearing red trunks.
Champ! This is Frank Lucas.
He weighs 215 pounds.
Here is Muhammad Ali!
His opponent,
from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,
he's wearing green trunks.
Who's that laughing
with Cattano?
How'd he get so
fucking close to the ring?
The Heavyweight Champion
of the World,
Joe Frazier!
Hey, Frank.
You gonna keep that
hat on all night?
I'm gonna miss the fight.
You paid for it.
SPEARMAN. ; This guy,
he's a supplier at most.
Or just a pimp.
Otherwise we'd know his name.
His tickets were phenomenal.
Better seats than
Dominic Cattano. Right?
Joe Louis shook his hand.
Who the fuck is this guy?
What's this?
That's the plate off the limo.
Check with the company
who rented it.
WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER:
Right there, Mr. Lucas.
Right there. Good.
PHOTOGRAPHER 1:
Can I get a shot here, Frank?
Right here.
PHOTOGRAPHER 2:
Looking good, Frank.
WOMAN: Beautiful.
MAN: Right on, Frank!
WOMAN: Congratulations!
She's the most beautiful
bride I've ever seen.
That's my sunshine
right there, Mr. Williams.
I wish Bumpy had met her.
WOMAN: Throw it to me!
Get a picture.
Come here, baby.
What's happening?
FRANK: Sit tight.
Congratulations, Frank.
Detective.
So, you sure you done
the right thing? I mean, she's
beautiful girl and all...
Hey, hey, listen, listen.
Before you say anything
about me or about my wife,
understand this is
the most important day
of my life, Detective.
Oh, I understand.
I understand.
You know, a man who
walks around in a
$50,000 chinchilla coat
and never even bought
me a cup of coffee.
There's something wrong there.
Pay your bills, Frank?
I don't know
what you're talking about.
Do you pay your bills,
I asked you?
If you're not getting
your share,
maybe you need
to talk to the
Chief of Police.
What's my share?
'Cause you don't even
fucking know me.
Maybe I'm special.
You are special.
TRUPO: You see
that right there?
Special Investigations Unit.
Special.
Get it?
Ten grand.
First of each month.
Deliver it right here.
Are you done?
Oh, yeah, I'm done.
TRUPO: Don't forget your card.
Have a nice fucking honeymoon.
FRANK: Let's go.
RICHIE. ;
His name is Frank Lucas.
Originally from Greensboro,
North Carolina.
A couple of arrests years ago.
Gambling and
unlicensed firearm.
For 15 years, he was
Bumpy Johnson's driver,
bodyguard and collector.
He was with him when he died.
He's got five brothers.
He's the oldest.
And a lot of cousins.
They all living up here now,
spread throughout the
five boroughs and Jersey.
The brothers are Dexter,
in Brooklyn.
He's a dry cleaner.
What can I do for you?
I'm picking up.
MAN. ; Yeah.
RICHIE. ; Melvin in Queens
has got a custom furniture
and fire doors business.
That's it right here?
Right there.
RICHIE. ; Terrence in Newark,
he has a hardware store.
Turner in the Bronx
has got a tire shop.
And Huey Lucas in
Bergen County has a body shop.
Is your manager here?
That's my price.
Oh, man, I'm gonna take it
somewhere else, all right?
These businesses are
the distribution and
collection points
for Frank's dope
and Frank's money.
Everything about
Frank's life seems
unpretentious,
orderly and legitimate.
He starts early,
gets up at 5.;00 a.m.
Has breakfast in a diner
in Harlem every morning,
usually by himself.
Then he starts work.
Takes a meeting with the
accountant or with his lawyer.
At nights, he usually
stays at home. And
if he does go out,
it's to one of two clubs
or a handful of restaurants
with his new wife.
Some ball players.
That's fucking
Wilt Chamberlain.
RICHIE. ; Friends, musicians.
Never, never with
organized crime guys.
Sundays, he takes
his mother to church.
Then he drives out
and he changes
the flowers on Bumpy's grave.
Every Sunday, no matter what.
TOBACK. ; Not the typical day
in the life of a dope man,
Richie.
RICHIE. ; No.
Bumpy Johnson's life
wasn't typical either, and
he ran Harlem for years.
TOBACK. ; So you're saying
that Frank Lucas replaced
Bumpy Johnson?
RICHIE. ; Yeah.
TOBACK. ; His driver?
TOBACK: Sounds RICHIE. ; Yeah.
A little farfetched.
RICHIE. ; But is it? Is it?
Because everything he does...
JONES: He's handing
out turkeys, man.
RICHIE. ;... he does the same as
Bumpy would have done, right?
And who was Bumpy
most likely to teach?
The guy he sees every day.
It's like a Sicilian family.
He's structured his
organization to protect him
in the same way.
And if he was with Bumpy
for so long,
that means he would have
spent a lot of time
with Italians.
Definitely long enough
to learn that much.
But here's the thing.
I don't think it's Frank Lucas
that we're after.
Who we want is whoever
Frank Lucas is working for.
It's whoever's actually
bringing the heroin in.
Okay. So what do
you have on him
that will stick in court?
Because this isn't it.
Without powder,
without informants,
no one's going to jail.
RICHIE:
That's understood, sir.
And I don't think we're
gonna get informants,
not from inside the family,
you know, unless we
get very, very lucky.
Straight up lab
tests suggesting
purity's consistent
with Asian dope.
The Italians, we know,
usually work with other
Europeans
or with the Turks.
We got small blue
packets turning up
in neighborhoods all
over the Tri-State area.
From Chinatown, to Harlem,
Washington Heights,
Richmond Avenue
and Staten Island.
They got North Orange,
Princeton, Bayonne,
Newark,
Syracuse, Rochester,
Buffalo, and all the
way through Connecticut.
The same dope.
All right.
That's it, down there.
Okay, let's all join hands.
Lord, we thank You for this
food we're about to receive,
the nourishments
of our bodies.
Feed our souls with heavenly
grace, in Jesus' name
and for His sake.
Amen.
ALL: Amen.
MAN: Shh. Shh.
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.
Come on, now.
It's okay. Shh.
You better get
yourself ready, old man.
Come on, big man.
Throw the ball.
Get yourself ready,
old man. All right!
Come on, now. Your pop said
you had an arm on you.
Come on!
I'm gonna set your ass
in the grass, Uncle Melvin.
MELVIN: Hey! Watch your mouth,
boy. Throw the ball!
STEVIE: Damn, Uncle Melvin,
I'm a pitcher,
not an outfielder!
Steve. Steve, come here.
Come, sit down.
Uncle Frank.
What's happening?
How you doing?
Cool.
You want a drink?
You know better than that.
Just checking.
Why didn't you show up
for that meeting, Steve?
I set it up with the
Yankees and Billy Martin.
Why didn't you show up?
Don't lie to me.
I don't want to
play ball no more.
I decided.
What you talking about?
You decided? Decided what?
(STAMMERING)
That ain't what I want.
What you talking about?
You've been playing since
you was a little boy.
You were ready to go
into the pros. What you...
Frank! We got a problem, man.
What do you want?
I want what you got,
Uncle Frank.
I want to be you.
He's been diluting
it so much.
We're down
2%, 3% pure.
And you tested it?
You're sure?
Yeah.
Fuck you looking at?
My man.
Welcome, Frank.
How you doing, Nick?
How you doing, Nick?
It's all great. Welcome.
I need to talk to you.
Great. Come on.
Hey, you all, everybody
get out! Let's go.
Come on! Hurry up!
Sit, my brother.
I take it you
talked to Charlie.
Guess you wanna hear more
about my Black coalition.
Let me explain to you...
No, no, no.
I'm all right.
That's not what I
came here for, Nick.
Yeah, everybody's
good, Nick.
You know, everybody's happy.
Charlie, Baz, the Italians,
you know, Johnny Law.
Everybody's happy
except you.
I'm happy, Frank.
You happy? Really?
Well, maybe I'm the
one with the problem.
Yeah, go on. Get one.
All right.
I gotta problem 'Cause
I don't understand
why you gotta take
something that's
perfectly good
and mess it up.
See, brand names.
Brand names mean something.
Understand?
Shut the fuck up!
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm sorry about
that bullshit.
Blue Magic.
That's a brand name.
Like Pepsi,
that's a brand name.
I stand behind it.
I guarantee it.
They know that,
even if they don't
know me any more than
they know the chairman
of General Mills.
What the fuck are you
talking about, Frank?
What I'm talking about is
when you chop my dope down
to one, two, three,
four, five percent
and then you
call it Blue Magic,
that is
trademark infringement.
You understand
what I'm saying?
With all due respect, Frank,
if I buy something, I own it.
No, that ain't true.
That ain't true.
If I buy a car, and I
wanna paint it, I can
paint the motherfucker.
Yeah, but you
don't have to.
This is what I'm
saying to you, Nick,
you don't have to.
Good enough the way it is.
You can make
enough money off it
the way it is, just by
calling it Blue Magic.
Anything more than
that is greed, son.
What you want, Frank?
You want me to change
the name on it?
I would have to insist
that you change the name.
Fine by me, Frank.
I'll call it Red Magic,
even though that
don't sound as good.
I don't give a fuck
what you call it.
Put a chokehold
on the motherfucker
and call it Blue Dog Shit,
you know what I mean?
I don't care, just
don't let me catch
you doing this again.
Catch me?
Infringement?
Insist?
I don't like these
words as much as,
"Please, thank you,
I'm sorry to bother
you, Nicky."
These are better
words you use to come
to my motherfucking club
without an invitation!
You hear me?
My man.
Oh, shit. Fuck, is that
the cops there, man?
It's all right.
The hell they're gonna do,
give us a ticket?
Stuff's in the car, Frank.
What?
Some of it's in the trunk.
How you doing, Frank?
I'm good. How you doing,
Detective?
How was your Thanksgiving?
Not so good, as a matter
of fact. Why don't you
get out of the car?
Come on, give me
the fucking keys.
Where's the Shelby at?
The Shelby's gone?
The Shelby's gone, Frank.
Stay right there.
Yes, sir. Right here.
TRUPO: You got anything
worth looking at in here?
RICHIE: Hey, that's
that Trupo guy.
SPEARMAN: Is that him?
RICHIE: Yeah.
Fucking prick.
Come over here a minute,
Frank.
Yeah.
What are we gonna
do about this?
We don't do shit about it.
We close it up, throw
it back in the trunk,
everybody go home,
have some pumpkin pie,
warm apple cider.
I got a better idea.
Or would you rather me
throw you and your brother
in the fucking river?
Would you rather your
house blows up next time?
I loved that car.
I know.
RICHIE: What's he doing?
Shakedown!
Somebody's getting some money
for the Benevolent Fund.
SPEARMAN: Look at that shit.
Sorry, Frank.
It's all right.
Go and get in the car.
RICHIE: All right,
you call me back.
INS, IRS, FBI.
I can't get a damn thing
out of any of them.
Because they all think
you're on the take.
And you think they are.
You know,
I don't think they
want this to stop.
I think it employs
too many people.
Judges, lawyers,
cops, politicians,
prison guards,
probation officers.
They stop bringing
dope into this country,
about 100,000 people
are going to be
out of a job.
Spearman.
FBI. Here to see
Detective Roberts.
So who took it out?
Somebody I know?
My wife?
Come on, if somebody's
taking a contract
out on my life,
I'd like to know.
I can't say without
compromising our source.
You understand?
No. Not when it's my life,
I don't understand.
If you want we can
assign someone to you.
FBI protection.
You know what?
My life is dangerous
enough as it is.
Well, we'll let you get
back to your business.
Okay. Larry, Bob.
Thanks for visiting
The Garden State.
Take care.
Hey, what do you know
about Frank Lucas?
We know that you keep
calling about him.
We believe that
peace is at hand.
We believe that
an agreement is
within sight.
As I said earlier...
Yeah.
Hey, Joey. Hi.
All right.
Yeah, tomorrow. Why?
RICHIE: What the fuck
is a microwave?
JOEY: It's a scientific force,
like atomic energy.
Yeah?
JOEY: Yeah.
It rearranges the molecules.
RICHIE: Of what?
JOEY: Of what? Of popcorn.
Of your head.
Stick it in. Go on.
I can get you one of those.
Brand new, just like this.
I'll have it delivered.
No, thank you.
Hey. Where is that?
Aspen. We just got back.
Had a great time.
You know who we met?
Who?
Burt Reynolds.
Yeah? Yeah?
Yeah. I'm not kidding.
A lot people from Hollywood
go up there now. They're
buying up everything.
This is your place?
Mmm.
You know what that's worth?
Ski in, ski out.
Five bedrooms.
Sauna. Everything.
We were guests.
It's your place.
Isn't there
something we can do,
about leaving
the big guy alone?
You know who I mean.
I don't report what
you just said, I can
get in a lot of trouble.
I do report it,
then the trouble is yours.
I'm hoping you won't do that.
Richie, come on.
I'm not taping it.
How do you know?
Because we're friends.
And I'm telling you,
this is a real offer.
From who? Your uncle?
Why would you do this?
Why would you risk
our friendship?
Because
I care what happens to you.
You shouldn't have done this.
I had to, I had no choice.
Neither do you. Richie!
You don't have a choice.
Just leave Frank Lucas alone.
Frank Lucas?
Yeah.
You tell Marie I had to leave.
I'm sorry.
Tell her why.
Don, t shoot! Don, t shoot! Talk! Talk!
Don't shoot!
Are you Richie Roberts?
Yes, so what?
You've been served. I'm sorry.
WOMAN: All right.
(WHISPERING) Laurie.
Look, I'm sorry I never
gave you the kind of life
you wanted, all right.
I'm sorry it was never enough.
Don't punish me
for being honest.
Don't take my boy away.
What are you saying?
That because you were honest
and you didn't take money
like every other cop,
I left you?
No, you don't take money
for one reason.
To buy being dishonest
about everything else.
And that's worse
than taking money nobody
gives a shit about.
Drug money, gambling money
nobody's gonna miss.
You know,
I'd rather you took it
and been honest with me.
Or don't take it.
I don't care. But then
don't go cheat on me.
Don't cheat on your kid
by never being around.
Don't go out and get laid
by your snitches
and your secretaries
and strippers!
I can tell by just looking,
she's one of them.
You...
You think you're going
to heaven because
you're honest, but you're not.
You're going to the same
hell as the crooked cops
you can't stand.
BAILIFF: All rise.
JUDGE: Please be seated.
Miss Dickerson,
before the court
renders its opinion,
is there anything else
you'd like to be heard on?
Yes, Your Honor.
Your Honor, a lot has
been said here today
about how unsavory
Mr. Roberts' environment
is for a child.
How dangerous it is.
We tell him to protect us.
We give him that
responsibility,
but then say, " Oh, we don't
trust you to raise a child.
"We don't think
you're fit for that."
I'm not.
You're right.
Being around me
is no place for a kid.
You take him to Vegas.
I'll come see him when I can.
Your Honor, I want
to apologize for wasting
the court's time.
FRANK: Doc.
I see them.
DETECTIVE: There he is.
The fuck is this guy doing?
DOC: Hey!
Champagne.
DOC: Merry Christmas,
Detectives.
For us?
DOC: Yeah. Enjoy that.
You fellas have a good time.
Mmm-hmm.
It's Cristal.
MAN ON TV. ; South Vietnamese
troops called in air strikes
on Communist positions
inside the city.
Paying off Johnny Law,
that's one thing.
There ain't no problem
with that.
I've been paying off
the police since I
was 10 years old.
Put more of their kids
through college than
the National Merit Award.
Give me one of
them round one... Yeah.
This is different,
though. These...
Special Investigative Unit.
That's their problem.
They think they're special.
Fucking crooks.
No code of ethics.
What do you think?
Looks great. It's beautiful.
Good.
The police, that ain't
the only somebody
I'm worried about.
I seeing cars where I ain't
never seen them before,
people I don't know.
Yeah, me, too.
EVA: Ho, ho, ho.
Merry Christmas,
Charlie.
Thank you.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Here, take this.
A quick toast,
and then I'll be off.
Somebody made a mistake.
Bumpy ain't hardly
ever go out no more.
After a certain point
he stayed in the house.
Watch TV.
Play chess.
Read the newspaper.
I though he was just trying
to lead the quiet life,
but no, he couldn't
go nowhere.
Not without
something happening.
Frankie...
We can still go out.
With who? Where?
Well, with...
But I know he's
under surveillance.
Ain't gonna be
no Christmas time
with my family
being here no more.
Why don't you just pay
who you have to pay?
I do pay them.
I pay thousands
and millions
to dope dealers,
crooks, cops.
I pay everybody.
I pay more than
they should get.
I can't satisfy
nobody!
It's like dope!
Everybody's
strung out!
The more you give 'em,
the more they want.
They expect more.
Give more and they want more.
Do you want to go out?
All right, baby.
Put something of
what you got.
Should I?
Yeah.
That's Christmas spirit.
That's what I'm talking about.
Feliz Navidad.
Something nice?
Mmm-hmm.
We're going to
have a great time.
That's right, chica.
Mr. Lucas.
Enjoy your evening.
It's all clear.
WOMAN: (EXCITEDLY)
Nicky!
NICKY: Who is that?
DOC: There's your boy,
Nicky. See him?
Yeah, I see him.
Let's keep going.
Around back?
FRANK: Hell, no. I ain't
sneaking into my own club.
Incredible.
Huh?
Come on.
Hold on. Hold on.
What?
I want to wait in the car.
Frank, I got it. I got it.
I'll wait for it. I got it.
Get that yellow sauce.
Yellow sauce.
And the chicken.
The Kung Pao chicken.
Can you turn the heater on?
Shit. I'm gonna go
get the keys.
Doc, give me the keys.
DOC: Here you go.
Doc!
Get out of the car.
DOC: You okay?
Yeah.
DOC: Shit.
Come on.
Come on, baby. You all right?
Let's go.
Was it Nicky?
We'll go right now and
fucking kill him whether
it was him or not,
you say the word, Frankie.
We got to do something, Frank.
We can't just sit here.
We're leaving.
All right, everybody get out.
TURNER: You all right, man?
Go on home.
It's Christmas time.
Go and be with your families.
I'm all right.
Go on. Go ahead.
Be with your kids.
Go ahead.
Where are we gonna go, huh?
We're gonna go to Spain,
somewhere? China?
Huh? Come on, sit down.
Tell me where you want to go.
Frank, we can go
anywhere we want.
No, we can't.
We can live anywhere, Frank.
Where? And do what?
Run? Hide?
Frank Lucas don't run
from nobody, baby.
We ain't going nowhere.
We're gonna stay right here.
We're gonna stay right here.
This is my home.
This is where my business is,
my wife, my mother, my family.
My country.
I ain't going nowhere.
I ain't running from nobody!
This is America.
And you ain't going
nowhere, either!
Huh?
A ceasefire, internationally
supervised, will begin
at 7.;00 p.m. This Saturday,
January 27th, Washington time.
SPEARMAN: I'll call you back.
Hey! What are you doing?
Richie.
Wow.
So, what I hear it was
the Corsican mob took
a shot at Frank.
You know, French Connection,
Fernando Rey,
the exporters that
Frank has put out of business.
Look, I can take care
of him in New York.
I just don't want to have
to worry that every time
he drives across
the bridge to Jersey,
someone's gonna take
another shot at him.
Richie, you and I gotta
start working together.
We need to step up
our efforts.
Next time,
their aim could be better.
We need to keep
this cash cow alive.
What the fuck
are you doing here?
Whoa!
Were you actually gonna
arrest Frank Lucas?
What's the matter with you?
What, you don't know?
No.
Everybody in
New Jersey's crazy.
Oh.
You know what we do here?
Cops arrest bad guys.
Before you get on
that bridge again,
you should call me first,
just make sure it's safe.
"I'm more enlightened
than some of my friends. I can
guarantee you peace of mind."
That's what you
told me, Dominic.
"I can guarantee you
peace of mind!"
I don't feel so peaceful!
Huh?
They tried to kill my wife!
Who was that? Huh?
Maybe it was one
of your peoples.
I don't know yet. No.
You don't know?
You don't know.
I'll tell you what I know.
Maybe I should just
put 500 guns
out there on the street
and just start shooting up
some people,
just to make a point.
Frank, it was a junkie.
It was a rival.
Some dumb-ass kid
trying to make a name
for himself. Somebody
you forgot to pay off.
Someone you slighted
without even realizing it.
Could be someone you
put out of business from being
so successful. Look at you.
Success, it's got enemies,
Frank. Lots of enemies.
So your success
took a shot at you. What are
you gonna do now?
How you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become
unsuccessful?
Frank, we can be successful
and have enemies, right?
Or we can be unsuccessful,
too, you know,
we can have friends.
That's the choice we make.
MAN ON TV. ; The final
evacuation of military
and diplomatic personnel
continued throughout
the night, as North Vietnamese
troops marched on Saigon.
The imminent fall of the city
has brought chaos and a
growing sense of desperation.
-Operator.
-Bangkok 367. International.
One moment, please.
FRANK. ; Yeah, Nate.
Hey, Frank. What's up, baby?
What's going on over there?
It's all over.
Yeah, I'm watching the news.
What the hell's going on?
The game's over, Frank.
Huh?
It's done.
Everybody going home, baby.
Give peace a chance.
Well, look, I'm not...
Listen to me.
I want two...
(WHISPERING)
I want 2,000
keys in the air.
It's impossible, Frank.
All our resources are
going home. It's over.
I'll tell you what.
I'm on my way over there.
Right now? Oh, come...
Yeah.
JIMMY: (SHOUTING)
You stole my shit?
Spearman, wake
the fuck up, man.
What?
Where's my shit, Darlynn?
Don't hurt me, Jimmy!
SPEARMAN: Jesus!
What the... Police!
JONES: Police!
SPEARMAN: Drop the gun, Jimmy!
JONES: Drop the gun!
JONES: Let me see your hands!
SPEARMAN: Jimmy,
drop the fucking gun!
JONES: I'm not playing with
you, Jimmy! I'll blast
your fucking head off!
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I got your gun
and I got your prints.
You know what you got?
You got attempted murder.
Fifteen fucking years!
Attempted murder is the
same as Murder One,
that's a grand jury.
Now, a grand jury could
come back favorably.
It could be reduced
to manslaughter.
All right?
Maybe even self-defense.
It all just depends
on how we wanna deal with you.
See where this is
fucking going, Jimmy?
Let's say you beat it.
What you think your cousin
Frank is gonna think?
Right, he is gonna know,
at some point in time,
we sat you down,
and we talked to you
like this.
And then you go to court
and you beat attempted murder?
What's he gonna think?
Is he stupid? Is your
cousin Frank stupid?
ABRUZZO: Answer him!
No. He's going to assume
that you talked.
But right now,
Frank doesn't know.
You want Frank to read
about this in the papers?
Or do you just want to
walk out of here?
No bail, no trial, no jail,
just walk out of here today.
Your choice.
Opium plants are hard enough
to outlive any war.
They'll still be here
long after the troops
have gone.
What are you going to do
for transportation when the
last US plane goes home?
I'll figure something out.
You will see me again,
that's for sure.
It is not in my best interest
to say this, Frank,
but quitting while
you're ahead
is not the same as quitting.
Yeah.
Hey.
Go get him.
Whatever you want to do, baby.
One second.
It's Frank.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Newark.
Short term,
parking lot three.
Short term, lot three.
That's the Mustang we talking
about, right? Okay, right.
What's the plate number?
K-A...
K-A...
FRANK. ;... 760.
HUEY. ;... 76.
Zero. All right.
There's no short term
lot three at Newark.
They got letters. A-B-C-D.
I know.
Maybe he means a time. 3:00?
JONES: This isn't no Jersey
license plate, nor New York,
for that matter.
K-A-7-6-0?
Yup.
Kilo Alpha?
A plane tail number?
Kilo Alpha 760.
You check commercial planes.
You guys check private planes.
Everything, from a little
fucking Cessna to the biggest
fucking whatever jet.
All right?
I'll check military planes.
Where you going, Jimmy?
You're not going anywhere.
Sit... Sit down.
Captain?
Yeah?
Richie Roberts. Essex County.
I know you're expecting us.
Here's our warrant.
We're looking on the plane.
Wait! Wait!
Scotty, stop all these
soldiers! Check their bags.
Every one of them.
No-knock warrant.
All right. Start upstairs.
Where are they going?
Step in, sweetie.
Ma'am, please sit down.
MRS. LUCAS: What is this?
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
All this stops!
Hey. Hey. Hey.
Nothing leaves this area,
all right?
Just slow down with this.
All right. Stop these trucks.
MAN: Hold on, hold on.
RICHIE: Everything off the
walls! Just pull it all down.
SPEARMAN: Damn
thing's a monster, Rich.
What is this?
Nothing leaves this area
till we've checked it.
All right, Captain. Nothing.
We got to take the plane down,
we got to look in the trucks.
Every man here gets searched.
Read the warrant, sir.
Your husband's
illustrious career is over.
The Feds are gonna come in,
gonna take everything.
And then they're gonna
take it all. But not before
I get my gratuity.
So where's the money?
What are you talking about?
What money?
What am I talking about?
What money?
The getaway money that
Frank and every other gangster
keeps in his house.
If you leave now,
there's a chance
Frank might not kill you.
Shut up! Sit down!
Sit down!
MAN ON TV. ; Defense today
announced the
planned evacuation
of all remaining US
combat forces from Vietnam,
news that comes
too late for some,
as here, on a solemn tarmac at
Dover Air Force Base.
This C-130,
loaded down with
its sorrowful cargo,
a cargo of America's bravest
and best, en route to
their final resting places.
You guys.
Take this coffin down.
Open it.
I'm not doing that.
Great fucking dog, huh?
You stop this, right now.
My warrant gives me permission
to examine this plane,
the plane and its cargo.
Well, you don't have
my permission.
I don't need it, Captain.
Easy! Easy, boy.
Come on. Hey!
Frank, move out of the way.
Damn.
That's enough!
Stay with these coffins.
Do not let them
out of your sight.
Got it. Okay.
TRUPO: Hey.
Help me out with this.
That was a military
transport plane.
If there was heroin
was onboard,
then someone in the military
would have to be involved.
Which means that even as
it fights a war that's claimed
50,000 American lives,
the military is smuggling
narcotics.
That is how this event today
will be interpreted.
That someone
employed by this office
believes that the United
States Army is in the
drug trafficking business
and is trying to prove it
by desecrating the
remains of young men
who have given their lives
in the defense of democracy!
There is dope on that plane.
Shut the fuck up!
Is it any wonder, then,
because of your actions,
the entire federal narcotics
program is now in jeopardy
of being dismantled
as completely and
enthusiastically
as that fucking
transport plane?
That is what you've
accomplished, Mr. Roberts,
single-handedly.
I had good information.
That the target of my
investigation was bringing
dope in on that plane.
And that target is?
Frank Lucas.
Who?
His name's Frank Lucas.
Who is Frank Lucas?
Who does he work for?
Which family?
He's not Italian. He's black.
Is that supposed to be
some kind of a joke?
You're this close
to the end of your career
in law enforcement
and you're making
fucking jokes?
My investigation indicates
that Frank Lucas is
above the Mafia in
the dope business.
My investigations
also indicate
that Frank Lucas buys
direct from a source
in Southeast Asia.
He cuts out the middlemen
and uses US military planes
and personnel to transport
pure #4 heroin into
the United States
and he's been doing so
on a regular basis since 1969.
I have cases against
every member of
Frank's organization.
Frank's organization?
No fucking nigger has ever
accomplished what the American
Mafia hasn't in 100 years!
And you would know that how?
Why? 'Cause your head is stuck
up your fucking ass?
Hey, Lou, do me a favor.
Will you get this fucking
kike out of here?
Kike? Kike?
Richie, no.
Hey, Richie!
Make it stick.
Spearman's with the coffins.
They're about a
quarter mile away.
FRANK: Doctor.
What?
Fucking Trupo came
by the house, man. It's bad.
Frankie, I need to speak
with you a minute. Please?
I got to go, Ma.
No, sit down just a minute.
Would you please
come back a little later?
Thank you.
Ma, I got to go. All right?
Just a few words.
Listen to me. I got...
Please, sit down.
Just a few words.
I've been thinking
about some things.
If you'd been a preacher,
your brothers would
have been preachers.
Right.
If you'd been a soldier,
they'd be soldiers.
You know that.
They came here because
of you. You called and
they came running.
Right.
That's because
they look up to you.
They always expect you
to know what's best.
But even they know
you don't shoot cops.
Even I know that.
Eva knows it.
All right, Ma.
The only one who
doesn't seem
to know is you!
All right, Ma. I got to go.
I promise you,
I ain't gonna shoot nobody.
I never asked you where
all this came from because
I didn't want to hear you lie.
I didn't want you to
worry about it. Now,
come on, I got to go.
Don't lie to me!
Don't do that.
Do you want to
make things so bad
for your family
that they'll leave you?
Because they will.
They'll understand.
She will leave you.
All right, Mama.
I will leave you!
JONES: Got coffins
on the move, Richie.
RICHIE: We want the
transport coffins,
not the ceremonial ones.
Who are these guys?
RICHIE: What does it say?
JONES: Bayonne
Custodial Services?
SPEARMAN: Bayonne
Cleaning Services?
ABRUZZO: Bayonne?
What the fuck is that?
SPEARMAN: Give me
the camera, Al.
RICHIE: Bingo.
JONES: Holy shit.
That's the baseball kid.
Oh, yeah.
That's Stevie Lucas.
So what you want to do,
Richie? Follow the trucks?
No. No. I wanna stay here
with the Lucas kid.
We'll follow that van.
You guys better eat up.
We're gonna have a long night.
HUEY: Come on,
more precious than gold, man.
This is more precious
than gold.
We got a couple more.
Let's go. Stack that up.
Take it. Take it.
MAN: Give me a second,
man, give me a second.
Hey. Yo. We got four caskets
left, man. Let's make some
fucking money in here.
SPEARMAN: What are
they loading in there?
ABRUZZO: What the fuck
are they loading in there?
SPEARMAN: That's the dope.
That's got to be
the dope! It's got to be.
RICHIE: Let's go.
Let's move.
Lou, it's Richie.
We got everybody
in place. Everybody.
TOBACK. ; Are you
sure this is it?
I'm positive, man. Okay?
All right, they're cutting
and bagging
in the South Tower
of the Stephen Crane
Projects right now.
TOBACK. ;
Are you sure this
is it? You're positive?
RICHIE. ; I'm positive, Lou.
I'm positive. Okay?
Everything is ready to go.
All the guys are ready to go.
Just push the button,
give me the warrant, okay?
Okay. You got it.
MAN: You all right?
Got the warrant.
All right.
Let's go!
Move!
Hi, ma'am. What's your name?
What's going on here?
Get down!
Get down, motherfucker!
Go.
Okay. Let's go, Al!
Move it, come on.
Come on, move it. Move it!
(WHISPERS) All set.
(WHISPERS) Roger.
Get ready.
MAN: There you go!
BOY: All right.
MAN: Come on.
At target.
Spearman, stand by.
I got civilians
on the target floor.
BOY: What? Oh...
MAN: Come on, there you go.
WOMAN: Hey, Tim.
MAN: Girl,
why don't you get
some clothes on?
MAN: Let's go.
You think you bad, huh?
Hold on. Where you going?
Where you going?
Come on!
BOY: I'll get it!
Where's Tim?
Quiet, kid!
I got some sandwiches
for you boys, man.
But where's Tim?
Shit. Man,
Tim always playing around.
Hey, man!
You got some Blue Magic, baby?
Fucking junkie!
Yo, handle that!
JONES: I'm sick! Come on!
I got money, man!
Come on, man,
you know me, baby!
Come on! Come on,
I need that Blue Magic, man.
It's me, Boogaloo, baby.
Hey, man, you know I got
your god damn money.
Come on, man.
And one, two, three!
GUARD: Fucking junkie.
ABRUZZO: Police! Police!
Drop it!
SPEARMAN: Get out, get out!
Drop the gun!
Don't do it!
Drop the gun, drop it!
Don't do it.
Scotty!
Police! Everybody down!
You motherfucker!
SPEARMAN: Police! Nobody move!
Look out!
RICHIE: Don't fucking move!
ABRUZZO: I want to see

ABRUZZO: I want to see
your hands! All the hands!
Police!
Down! Down! Get down!
Stay the fuck down!
Hey, man, what's going on?
What the hell...
Stay down! Down,
motherfucker! Stay down!
Hands! Hands!
Out at home, baby.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
FRANK: Y'all wait right here.
Wait right here.
Mrs. Lucas,
please step back inside.
Yes, Officer.
Please, Mother Lucas,
step inside, please.
Respectfully, ma'am,
please step inside.
Thank you. Step inside.
Hands up against the wall.
Stay back.
Oh, man.
Don't you owe me money?
I'll get you some more.
Here you go.
Yo, yo! Pigs! Look out!
POLICEMAN: NYPD!
Everybody stand still!
Turner! Go!
Down on the ground,
motherfucker!
...dead servicemen returning
from defending our
country in Vietnam...
Over there. Okay.
JUDGE: Ladies and
gentlemen, at this stage
of the proceedings
the counsels are ready
for their opening statements.
For the prosecution,
Mr. Roberts will proceed
with his opening
statement first.
Mr. Roberts,
are you ready to proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,
the state will show
and you will hear
that Frank Lucas
is the most dangerous man
walking the streets
of our city.
All right, y'all,
get on out. Let me talk to
Mr. Richie alone.
Come on, come on, come on.
I pay y'all by the hour,
not by the minute.
Thank you.
You ain't wearing a wire,
are you?
No.
All right.
I was talking to my lawyers.
They said something to me,
I can't believe it.
Did you really find
a million dollars in
the trunk of a car
and then turn it in?
Did you do that?
Yeah.
You did that for real, huh?
My man. Good for you. Shit.
You know Johnny Law got,
though, right?
About it, Mr. Richie.
You know he got it.
You turned that money in,
he took it and you ain't
get nothing for it. Did you?
Why did you do that?
It was the right thing to do.
That's true.
That's a good answer.
It was the right thing to do.
The question I have,
the question I've been
asking myself is,
would you do it again?
I mean, that's a lot of money,
that's a long time ago.
Many car payments ago,
many child support
payments ago.
So I said to myself,
the onlyest way to find out
is to find out.
RICHIE: Bribery, extortion,
murder, racketeering...
FRANK. ; Now,
you give me an address,
I'll make sure the
car's there, I'll make sure
that money's in that trunk.
No, thanks.
You sure?
Come on, now, Richie.
What do you think,
that impresses me?
You think that you're better
than them? You ain't no better
than them other cops.
In fact, you're the same
as them. You are them.
Let me ask you this.
Do you really think that
putting me behind bars
is going to change
anything on them streets?
Them dope fiends
is gonna shoot it,
they're gonna steal for it,
they're gonna die for it.
Putting me in or out
ain't gonna change one thing.
Then that's the way it is.
That's just the way it is.
So what we got, Richie?
We got me and you
sitting here.
We got that little snitch-ass
driver for my brother.
You got a little
bit of powder.
You're going to need
more than that, Richie.
RICHIE. ; I got possession,
supply, conspiracy,
bribing a law officer. I got
people who'll attest to seeing
you kill in cold blood.
I got your offshore bank
accounts, your real estate,
your businesses,
all bought with money
from heroin.
And I got hundreds of
parents of dead kids.
Addicts who OD'ed on
your product. And that's
my story for the jury.
And that's how I make
it all stick. " This man
murdered thousands of people.
"And he did it
from a penthouse,
driving a Lincoln."
Aside from that,
you got nothing
to worry about.
That's pretty good.
But that's why we go to
court, isn't it, Richie?
'Cause I got witnesses, too.
I got celebrities.
I got sports figures.
I got Harlem, Richie.
I took care of Harlem, so
Harlem's gonna take care
of me. You can believe that.
I got more than that, Frank.
What you got?
I've got a line of people
wanting to testify
against you,
it stretches out the door
and around the block.
You damaged a lot of lives,
Frank. I got the Mazzano
crime family.
Remember those boys?
You put them out of business.
I ain't got nothing to do
with no Mazzanos.
Mazzanos ain't got nothing
to do with me.
They got everything
to do with you.
What, they...
You know why?
Why?
Because apart from the fact
that they hate you personally,
they hate what you represent.
I don't represent nothing
but Frank Lucas.
You sure?
A black businessman like you?
You represent progress.
The kind of progress
that's going to see them
lose a lot of money.
With you out of the way,
everything can return
to normal.
My man.
You know what normal
is to me, Richie?
I ain't seen normal since
I was six years old.
Normal is seeing the police
right up to my house
dragging my little
12-year-old cousin out,
tying him to a pole,
shoving a shotgun in his mouth
so hard they bust his teeth.
Then they bust two shotgun
shells in his head and
knock his fucking head off.
That's what normal is to me.
I didn't give a fuck
about no police then.
I don't give a fuck about
no police now. Shit.
You know what, you can do
whatever you want to do.
So, it don't mean nothing
to me for you to show up
tomorrow morning
with your head blown off.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
Yeah, Frank. Get in line.
That one stretches
around the block, too.
All right.
What do you want to do?
You know what you got to do.
What do you want me to do?
Snitch, huh?
I know you don't want me
to give up no cops.
What do you want?
You want gangsters?
Pick one. Jew gangsters?
Mick gangsters? Guineas?
They've been bleeding
Harlem dry since they got
off the boat, Richie.
I don't give a fuck
about no crime figures.
You can have them.
I'll take them, too.
You'll take them, too?
No, you didn't.
You're talking about police.
You want police?
You want your own kind?
They're not my kind.
They're in business with you,
Frank. They ain't my kind.
They ain't my kind
like the Italians are
not yours. All right?
Huh.
What can you
promise me, Richie?
I can promise you,
you lie about one name,
you'll never
get out of prison.
You lie about one dollar, in
one offshore account, you'll
never get out of prison.
Now you can live life
rich in jail for the rest
of your born days,
or be poor outside
for some of them.
That's what I can promise you.
I want them cops, Richie.
That's what I want,
I want them cops
that took that money
out of my pockets.
Him, too.
All right. Okay.
Hey, Spearman? Spearman.
So these guys are
all connected up
to Gywnn, all right.
See this guy here,
he's in uniform...

FRANK: MacNamara. Vendazzo.
Trupo.
You are special.
It's good work, Frank.
You know...
You don't want a drink
or something? Celebrate?
You got any holy water?
Check your property.
Sign, please.
Smell better out here?
Frank. There you are.
Caffe latte. Yeah.
Latte?
Oh, shit. Yeah.
You all right?
That's a fancy
way of saying
coffee with milk.
Yeah.
$2.50.
So you been talking
to your brothers?
No, no, I ain't talked
to them in years.
It's probably
best for them.
What the hell
am I going to do
out here, Richie?
I don't know
how I'm gonna live.
Hey, I told ya,
I ain't gonna let
you starve, all right?
Obviously,
you ain't starving.
Bagels and blinches
They will catch up
with you, you know?
Who's this?
Expensive sneakers.
About $100 a pair.
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard.
This used to
be Eighth Avenue,
why do they call it
Frederick Douglass
Boulevard now?
This was me Richie,
right here.
This was all me.
In my day there
were so many niggers
out here buying dope
you could've made
a Tarzan movie.
You know, one phone call,
I'll be right back in
business, you know that.
You don't do that, Frank.
These days I keep
all my promises.
Why'd you come
and get me, huh?
You're a superstar, Frank.
A superstar?
Your evidence alone
gave me 150 convictions.
Thought the least
we could do is give
you a ride home.
Yeah, you sure
did that.
You gave me a ride
home. Free ride.
Coming to gangsters.
What?
Ain't nothin', man.
Ain't nothin', man.
That's life right there.
That's life right there.
Even a fool gets
to be young once.
