Did you feel it too, Supreme Kai?
Yes, he really did wake
up quickly this time.
Peace is indeed a
short-lasting thing.
Yes, Supreme Kai.
Yes.
Yes, I felt it too.
Hey Goku, be quiet a little!
I'm in the middle of a conversation!
Goku?
Is Son Goku there?
Yes yes.
He came to this planet to train.
You must not let him know!
He'll without a doubt show interest!
Yes, about Beerus sama...
In that case...
Who's Beerus sama?
Goku!
Is it a name of a snack?
You know it!
It's a very delicious snack!
That can't be true.
You talked in a scared tone,
King Kai.
It's something you don't need to know.
If you say it like that,
it makes me more curious.
I'm never going to tell you.
You were talking to the
Supreme Kai, right?
Should I ask him myself?
Okay, fine. Just don't use
instant transmission.
Don't tell the Supreme Kai
that you heard it from me.
In this world, there is a god who
gives birth to planets and life.
Just like the Supreme Kai.
On the other hand, there is a god
who destroys planets and life.
How many planets will be
destroyed this time?
Beerus sama, the God of
Destruction has awoken.
Looks like we won't feel
in peace for a while.
Why are you in your uniform?
Beerus sama  should be
very strong.
Oi, don't tell me...
I'm curious to see how strong he is!
Idiot!
What's wrong?
You don't know anything!
Beerus sama's power is on a
completely different level!
He's the world's strongest, God
of Destruction, Beerus sama!
He's a god who even makes the
Supreme Kai,
wet himself a little, from fear!
Him being the strongest
in the world concerns me.

Please open your eyes, Beerus sama.
You can't sleep twice.
You're the one who set up the
alarm bomb at this time.
If you don't wake up quickly,
the second alarm will...
I know,
I know.
You can't oversleep for 15
years like you did before.
If you still can't wake up,
shall I sing a song to
awake you?
In that case!
I know, I know!
I only slept 39 years this time,
so it only counts as a nap.
You're the one who decides When you wake up, Beerus sama.
Anyways, why at this time?
There's something concerning me.
By the way, Whis.
While I was sleeping, did
Frieza destroy Planet Vegeta?
Yes, without a trace left.
Is that so?
The fools on that planet were useless
no matter how much time passed.
King Vegeta was especially worse.
I could have destroyed it, but
that planet is really far away.
I couldn't be bothered.
On another note, Frieza
is pretty bad himself.
Showing off and all.
Should I destroy him
the next time we meet?
There is no need.
Frieza is already dead.
There's someone who can
kill Frieza?
Please wait a moment.
I think I've seen this somewhere.
What is this guy?
He's a Saiyan.
He's called Son Goku,
otherwise known as, Kakarot.
Didn't the Saiyans meet their
end alongside Planet Vegeta?
Most of them did so.
Luckily, the ones who were at the time
on another planet managed to survive.
Just to note, Prince
Vegeta is one of them.
Weren't Saiyan's hair black?
Put that aside, a Saiyan
managed to win against Frieza.
More recently, it seems that the Saiyans
mastered an ability to become a Super Saiyan.
What's that?
Super Saiyan.
Super Saiyan!?
Is that so.
There was someone like him!
What do you mean?
Hmm, Super Saiyan.
Super Saiyan...
Super Saiyan God!
I saw it in a dream!
Fighting against a guy like this,
known as, Super Saiyan God!
Do you still not understand?
It's a precognitive dream,
a precognitive dream!
A dream?
Your dreams have very low cases
of accuracy, Beerus sama.
Even before, you dreamt an idol
moving here, and it was wrong.
Are you treating me like an idiot?
Okay, follow me Whis!
Oracle Fish,
Oracle Fish, are you there!?
I went for a walk.
What's up?
You said 39 years ago that,
in 39 years,
I'll face an enemy of threat.
I said that?
You did!
Well, then let's say I did.
See? The prediction made by the Oracle
Fish and my precognitive dream.
It's going to appear,
a formidable enemy!
The Super Saiyan God!
This sure is subtle.
Isn't it implausible that there would be a
formidable enemy of threat to you, Beerus sama?
Well, even if the prediction that
there is a threat was to be untrue,
it feels like someone
interesting will appear!
That's why
I woke up early.
So that was the case.
So, are you going to go meet
the Saiyans?
Of course.
I have to find the Super Saiyan God.
Super Saiyan God you say?
Sounds like an exaggerated name.
Feels old fashioned...
I found them,
most of the living Saiyans.
Planet 4032-Green-877
There seems to be around
five, on planet Earth.
Earth?
I've never heard of it.
Except for the one Saiyan,
who killed Frieza.
He seems to be on the
Northern Kai's planet.
A Saiyan on a Kai's territory?
Suspicious.
Whis,
how long will it take to get there?
Approximately, 26 minutes.
I'll be able to watch
1 Episode of Anime.
It's far away.
Can't be helped.
Let us go.
Then shall we?
Happy Birthday Bulma!
Not coming?
Why is he training with King
Kai is at a time like this?
He's someone who would do that.
I let him know half a year ago!
What about Vegeta?
He seems to be training.
Can't help those Saiyans!
Bulma if it's your
birthday, how old are you?
Rude,
do you think I'd tell you that?
The prize of the bingo competition
consists of a castle and a plane, right?
Yeah, if it's bothersome, you
can have it in cash instead.
As expected from the world's most wealthy!
Would Goku at least come
for the bingo competition?
Bulma, do you have any
pornography as a prize?
No!
Goku, Trouble is coming!
Here... here...
Is Bulma coming?!
No, its Beerus sama!
The God of Destruction, Lord
Beerus, is making his way here!
I can't feel anything.
You guys can't feel
a god's presence.
Do you understand? Avoid
any foolish actions.
I said it'll be fine.
Okay!
This is worrying.
Goku, hide inside my house!
Why?
Hurry!
Even if you say hurry...
Hurry up!
Okay~
Why, why is Beerus sama coming here?
Why?
Beerus sama,
why would you...
Welcome! The long travel
must have been tiring.
Long time no see, Northern-Kai.
Your planet is very small.
I apologize, it's quite the
boring and mundane planet.
You made it smaller by
destroying it, Beerus sama.
Because you lost at Hide and Seek.
Was that so?
On another note, what brings
you here, Beerus sama?
I just have a business with
that Saiyan hiding over there.
This is bad!
Come out.
I apologize for my rudeness.
Goku, greet Beerus sama!
Hi, I'm Go
Fool!
I knew you'd say that!
Since you're old enough,
at least greet properly.
Ah, Hello.
Not that...
I'm Son Goku!
Nice to meet you.
I would like to ask you something.
about Super...
Saiyan God.
Yes, do you know about the
existence of Super Saiyan God?
Super Saiyan God?
I know what Super Saiyan is,
but I've never heard of "God."
Never heard of it!
I have also never heard
of this Super Saiyan God.
Is that so?
I heard from Whis that
you defeated Frieza?
Frieza?
Yes, I defeated Frieza.
Seeing you now... I don't
think you'd be able to.
It seems that you power up by
turning into a Super Saiyan.
Yes, you know well.
And you still don't know "God"?
Whis, is Prince Vegeta on
Earth, a Super Saiyan as well?
Yes, three others too.
They all seem to be able to transform.
You knew that much?
They can all transform...
Seems suspicious...
Would we be able to get a
clue, if we go to Earth?
Beerus sama, I assume that the other
Saiyans wouldn't know as well.
We'll know if we ask.
Shall we go to Earth?
Umm...
You're not planning to destroy
it or anything, right?
If there isn't anything
that annoys me.
Hey you, I mean...
I heard Beerus sama  is
extremely powerful.
Would it be too much to
ask for you to show me?
You want to see my power?
How?
Even if it's just a little,
would you like to spar with me?
Goku, enough!
I've lived long but, I've
never anything like that.
You have very good self-confidence.
Or are you simply an idiot?
Yes, He's an idiot!
A simple idiot!
Okay.
Then fight me with your full power.
Thank you... I mean
But is it okay if I use
my full power at once?
Even if you get hurt, please don't
get angry and destroy this planet.
I promise.
Come at me.
Ok!
Firstly, this is Super Saiyan.
Secondly, Super Saiyan 2!
And finally, the strongest Super Saiyan 3!
Run, Bubbles!
This is surprising.
Seems that you weren't bluffing.
Isn't that right?
Should I go back to
Super Saiyan 2?
No, stay like that.
Let's begin.
Underestimating me, okay!
Here I come!
Okay.
See you again, Northern-Kai.
Were you alive, you fool.
I can't sit around like this.
I have to tell Vegeta
as soon as possible.
Vegeta, this is King-Kai.
What does the King-Kai want with me?
Listen carefully to what
I'm about to say.
Not far from now, Beerus sama, the God
of Destruction will arrive on Earth.
The God of Destruction?
I've heard of that name.
Anyways, even if
Beerus sama  arrive there,
never, never
lay a finger on him.
If you don't listen, the entire
Earth will be destroyed!
Earth, destroyed?
Even Goku completely lost.
What?!
Kakarot lost?!
Super Saiyan 3 Goku was
defeated in two hits.
Two hits...?
I beg you, the fate of the
Earth is in your hands.
Amazing...
That such guy exists...
Was it, Super Saiyan God?
He's finally here, Vegeta.
Why are you wearing your training
attire on your wife's birthday?
Why do you look so gloom?
Are you shocked that your wife
is gaining age, yet again?
You Saiyans are lucky that you don't age.
Shut up!
What do you mean, shut up!?
What is this uneasy feeling.
Am I trembling in fear?
Really, what is it!
God of Destruction, Beerus.
I'm sure I've met him before.
You're Prince Vegeta, correct?
You've become a fine adult.
The thing you guys call "Ki"
doesn't seem to work on gods.
Did you remember?
I remember!
The last time we met was when you
were still a child, I presume?
Don't you remember?
I received some generosity
from your father, King Vegeta.
God of Destruction...
...Beerus sama!
The kai wasn't
joking around.
This guy is dangerous,
too dangerous!
You seem to be doing
something interesting.
And I smell something
very nice.
This is my wife's
birthday party.
Wife?
Then you should
introduce her to me.
Beerus sama.
Oh yes, I forgot something
very important.
Say, does "Super Saiyan
God" ring a bell to you?
Super Saiyan God?
You don't know?
Your precognitive dream
as expected, was wrong?
There is no "wrong" in my dictionary.
There seems to be a lot?
You're a little annoying.
You disappeared without
saying anything, Vegeta.
And this is?
This is Beerus sama  and...
It's Whis.
People you know?
Hello, I'm Bulma.
I'm Vegeta's beautiful wife.
Hello, Bulma.
They are well mannered people,
unexpected from your accomplices.
Although they don't looking
like they're from Earth.
Aliens, you're aliens!
Enough!
We found Vegeta after
coincidentally arriving on Earth.
Are you tourists?
If you don't mind would
you like to join us?
We welcome you.
Oi!
Thank you for your concern.
The truth is, we've been seeing and smelling
nice looking food since a while ago.
Please enjoy yourselves!
Let's go.
Where are the Dragon Balls?
All seven should have been
collected here.
I don't know why they're not making
a wish, but to us it's a chance!
Our next goal is wealth!
Wasn't it world domination?
Obtaining wealth comes first!
I'm sick of living in poverty!
With a child's body, I won't even
be able to get a part time job!
I am Emperor Pilaf!
We were finally able to
make a wish to Shenron...
Then you said, "Give us Youth!"
Even so, there would be no point
in dominating the world at an old age,
then to just die.
But we became too young.
I have no complaints.
I've already exceeded a
dog's life expectancy.
Don't just mess around,
find the Dragon Balls!
If we can't find them,
at least take something of value!
Yes sir!
Lord Pilaf!
What?!
This...
Let's see.
Bingo Prizes?
Perhaps...
All of this!
is the prize?!
A castle as a prize?!
The wealthy are clearly different.
I'll tag on it!
You're not a child...
Maybe in this castle...
Lord Pilaf!
Did you find them?
It's 10 years worth of
ham!
Take around 2 to 3.
What is the prize for 2nd place?
It's an enormous diamond!
Let's take it!
Wait, if this is the 2nd place prize..
The 1st place prize is...
We found it too easily.
Lord Pilaf.
All 7 are here!
Hooray!
Lord Pilaf, let's make our wish here.
Fool!
If we were to call Shenron here,
the ceiling would collapse!
Hey, you guys!
What are you doing here?
We're friends to this place!
My friend?
Are you the son of the owner?
A talking monkey!
Monkey...!
Who's the monkey?!
I am Emperor Pilaf!
We are burgulars.
Why are you telling him our identity?!
Oi, Goten,
come here.
There's a funny monkey here!
I am not a monkey!
Hey, child,
be quiet!
Do you want to get hurt?
What?
That!
That classical hairstyle...
I've seen it before.
Here Take it!
Lord Pilaf, wait!
That was one weird monkey.
Hey, who's that pretty girl
who gifted you that shiny rock?
Your friend, Trunks?
She is my girlfriend!
Amazing, right?
Are you two dating?
Well, yeah.
We've held hands too.
Amazing!
Right.
Amazing.
Crap, why is he here?!
He was a child too.
We weren't able to obtain
the Dragon Balls because of him!
Crap, what is this?!
Look at this!
I fooled them with the diamond!
They won't realise that
the four star ball was robbed!
Well done, Mai!
Yes!
Wait, we can't make a wish
with one.
Don't worry, Lord Pilaf.
We'll tell them,
"If you want this back give us a
million Zenny!"
That girl is Trunks' girlfriend?
I don't know who's bloodline
you're related to but, not bad~
Amazing.
Amazing.
Well, yeah.
Bring her here.
Hey.
Did you fly here young master?!
I was trying to act cool and
said that youu were my girlfriend...
Me?!
Not you!
Me?!
How did it come to that?!
that girl there!
Me?!
Why would I.. with a child like you...
You're a child too.
So I was.
Sorry but would you just go along with it for a bit.
Pretend I'm your girlfriend?
What should I do?
Well, holding hands...
HANDS?!
Why are kids these days
so rebellious?
You can eat all the food you want!
All the food you want!
There's also a Bingo Competition.
Okay, thats fine.
Please wait a moment.
Lord Pilaf,
even though he's just a kid...
To hold his hand
after just meeting him would be...
You're already old enough!
Even if it's from you, there's
a line!
You're doing it, Mai.
It's for the nice food,
bingo and...
We'll get the Dragon Balls there!
I think I've seen that
woman before.
Back then!
Right?!
The one with that kid back there...
There's nothing but trouble here..
Let's go.
Okay...
This Takoyaki thing is interesting...
Very delicious.
The thing called Sauce and Soy Sauce
are very delicious as well.
So your name is Mai.
How old are you, Mai?
I'm 41 years old.
Don't make fun of an adult!
Ka-
Me-
Ha-
Me-
Please don't cause more destruction.
HA!
Ruthless!
Not good enough, I won't be able to
defeat the God of Destruction.
Beerus sama  was much more powerful!
Hey, King Kai.
With such little training,
I don't think I can become a
Super Saiyan God.
On another note,
it's not appearing.
The Super Saiyan God.
I was a little excited.
It seems that the Saiyans here,
are all half-bloods except
Son Goku and Vegeta.
And two of them are still kids.
It's time for what you've been waiting for!
Bingo Competition!
Although there are great prizes
like a castle and a plane,
the best of them all,
are the 7 Dragon Balls!
You'll be able to make any wish
after you win!
Those look similar to the wish marbles
from Planet Namek.
Seems that Earth's god is from Namek.
If I'm correct, a dragon appears
from those marbles and grants a wish?
Hey, wait a moment!
There's one missing!
The 4 star is gone!
Can't be! They were all here a while ago.
Hey, you're going already?
Mai, give me your phone number.
I don't have a high tech
device like that!
Wait!
Idiot!
Crap, we've fallen into a trap.
It's because you were being loud!
Since it came to this,
it can't be helped.
Crap!
Lord Pilaf!
Hey, you guys!
If you don't want to see this kid die,
hand over a million Zenny!
100,000 Zenny will also work...
What's funny?
We'll really kill him!
They just said they'll kill him,
but everyone's laughing.
Does this require a punishment.
No, that girl seems to be
my son's girlfriend.
They're playing a boring prank!
We're really going to shoot!
Hey, Mai?
Shut up, hostage!
Your chest is touching me.
This is an interesting scene!
Good! I'll join as well!
Cute villains!
The Great Saiyan Man
will not forgive your evil deeds!
Suspicious...
Is that the Super Saiyan God?
Please don't misunderstand!
That's just Kakarot's son
wearing a costume.
Lady, try shooting me!
Something like that...
Don't come!
You can really shoot!
That would be more fun!
Thats right, while you're at it,
shoot all the bullets!
That would be good!
A... All?
It's fine, he can deflect all of them away.
Don't shoot my legs, that would
be boring.
Aim for my face.
Okay, villain!
Shoot!
Have it your way!
How was that villain!?
Did you realise,
The Great Saiyan Man's power?
He's acting unusual after
drinking some Sake.
You guys, I thought that was a toy,
but it was a real gun!
It's not good for a kid to carry this!
If it wasn't me,
something serious would have happened!
It hurts!
Videl, are you okay?!
Videl!
Gohan, you injured your wife!
I.. I'm sorry!
I'll heal her.
What are you trying to do?
Watch your mouth,
he is a god.
God?!
Really?!
Oi, were you a god?!
It's healed.
Thank you very much, god.
Umm.. inside your belly...
It's still a secret!
I see!
Gohan, you're temporarily
banned from having alcohol!
Do you understand?!
Yes!
Thank you, Dende..
No.. God!
It flew at me as well...
It itches a little.
It's not a good feeling.
Not a good feeling at all!
In that case, are you going to
destroy Earth?
It'll be best to rebuild the entire planet.
Before creation,
there shall be destruction.
Hey, you guys!!
The sideshows over!
It's time to have fun with Bingo!
BINGO~?
Why is Vegeta like that...
Enjoyable  BINGO~?
Earth is a fun place~?
THE  FOOD  IS  ALSO  TASTY~?
Enjoyable BINGO~?
That was slightly creepy.
Yeah, his singing and dancing skills
were so bad.
they were on par with your
singing Whis.
Priceless...
Well, lets calm down and
continue our meal.
Yeah.
Good job.
You guys, these aren't toys.
Don't run off with them.
But the act was a little enjoyable!
Thank you.
Since we have all the Dragon Balls,
we'll start bingo!
I threw away my pride, just to
calm down Beerus sama...
But there shouldn't be
anymore problems.
All that's left to do is to hope for him
to leave Earth satisfied...
Any winners?
Beerus sama, have you tried those
deserts called pudding?
They're very smooth and tasty.
What, pudding?
Where are those?
Over there.
Hey you, would you mind sharing one of those?
Two, including mine.
If it's troublesome, only one for me
would be fine.
You're selfish, Beerus sama.
You already ate one!
Give me one.
I don't want to!
What did you say?!
I'm going to eat all of it alone!
Even when there's so many?!
All mine!
Hand it over!
I don't want to!
Hand it over!
I don't want to!
Hand it over, idiot!
You called me an idiot!
I'll turn you into snack and eat you!
Shit, just when I take my eyes off...
You've made me angry!!
Wait...!
Beerus sama, please calm down!
Stop him!
Since you didn't hand over a pudding,
I'll make it especially painful.
Stop it!
Crap, whatever!
Thank you for waiting.
This is very delicious!
What is this food called?
It's called Sushi.
Fusion-
Fusion- HAH!
Your fighting sense is impressive.
Oi, the Cat-Human over there!
Just because of a pudding!
I, Gotenks will beat up someone
with such poor manners!
What did you say?
You Earthlings would have
tried it a lot.
But to me, it's a food which I can't
even imagine the taste of!
Pudding!
It looks so delicious
and beautiful!
Loud!
Stop it, he's not an opponent you can...
It hurts, it hurts!
We're sorry!
I knew he was strong,
but I didn't think he'd be
at this kind of level.
Crap, is this the end?
No pudding, and
no Super Saiyan god.
There is only left to destroy.
It'd be an honor to be killed by
the God of Destruction, Beerus.
You're just saying nice things aren't you.
Well then, as you wish...
Wait, that's enough!
I don't know whether you're Vegeta's
friend or not but,
you ruined my 38th birthday!
She was 38 years old!
You... you
hit my Bulma!
You bastard!
He sure is amazing.
That Vegeta,
he finally surpassed Goku.
Take this!
What's that?
Are they shooting fireworks again
at Capsule Corp?
How's that?
As expected, that wasn't the
Super Saiyan God either.
I don't care, I'm going to
destroy Earth and go home.
Whis!
Please wait a moment!
Sea Urchin?
This is also very delicious.
I won't let you just
detroy and destroy!
You're a pain,
I already said it's over.
Vegeta!
Vegeta!
Hey, Whis!
Did you call me, Beerus sama?
As you said, it seems that Super Saiyan God
was just a lousy dream.
I said it before!
We're destroying Earth and going back!
I understand, but
please wait a moment.
How's your Tuna Roll?
It's the best!
But it seems that there's
not much time left.
Can I have this to go?
Wait!
Goku
Goku san!
Son!
It's you again?
What is it this time?
Did you find out anything about
God?
That's still a mystery,
but don't destroy this planet.
I am the God of Destruction.
I know, Beerus sama.
But, just this time,
can you let it pass?
Then what, are you going to
fight me again?
I'd like to... but..
To be honest, I don't think
I stand a chance against you.
That's it!
Beerus sama, can I test something?
What?
You know, that
Super Saiyan God.
I might be able to do it!
How?
Give me a little time!
Just a little!
Please!
Fine, only a little.
Thank you.
Bulma, I'll use these Dragon Balls.
Okay, if you're going to defeat that
bad mannered idiot.
You're mean,
he's a god!
Did you say, god?
Yay
What, if you're a god,
don't get mad over a pudding, idiot!
He's not an ordinary god.
He's the world's most fearsome,
the God of Destruction.
He's called Beerus sama.
He's the strongest in the world.
Even the Supreme Kai and King Kai,
wet themselves in front of him!
Everyone, please watch your tone.
When Beerus sama  get upset,
a galaxy disappears in an instant.
Bi... Beerus sama!
Stop it!
It won't work from a middle-aged woman!
Shut up!
Goku, what are you trying to do
with the Dragon Balls?
Come out, Shenron!
And grant my wish!
That's right! You're trying to ask
Shenron to prevent the destruction of Earth!
Nope, that's overdoing it.
Capsule Corp?
The wealthy sure do
put on a different show.
I'll grant any wish.
Speak.
Hey, Shenron.
Do you know about
Super Saiyan God?
What's that?
It's the same question as I had.
Yeah, I know about it.
You know? Really?!
It's true. Is your wish to ask
whether it's real or not?
No, if you do know,
could you bring it here?
I cannot.
It doesn't exist.
Super Saiyan God is,
a god created by the Saiyans.
What do you mean by that?
You have a lot of questions.
What exactly is your wish?
Beerus sama  is telling us to hand over the
Super Saiyan God.
Beerus sama..?!
Beerus sama...
Nice to meet you...
Teach me how to make a
Super Saiyan God.
Yes sir...
I've never seen Shenron like that.
The Super Saiyan God,
revolted after feeling the darkness within
your fellow Saiyan comrades.
It was a saviour created by Saiyans
with good morals which was rare.
This saviour quickly defeated the
dark-hearted Saiyans with incredible
strength.
But with a few left to go,
the saviour returned to normal.
The saviour used up all their strength.
Afterwards, Planet Vegeta became
a place filled with evil Saiyans,
and the saviour disappeared,
even from legends.
The disappeared legend,
That's one long story!
Do you understand, Vegeta?
If five good-hearted Saiyans
hold hands and,
if the light from one good-hearted Saiyan's
heart is transmitted,
That Saiyan becomes the Saiyan God.
I've taught you the procedure,
this is goodbye.
Excuse me.
Five good-hearted Saiyans?
Impossible.
That means there's only
Gohan and Goten.
That's rude!
Despite Vegeta, Trunks
has a good heart!
Someone with a girlfriend at such age
is impure.
Which era are you living in?
Aren't you being jealous?
Yeah, Piccolo!
Are you saying Goku is impure as well?!
Without a doubt, Goku is kind,
but he's an idiot obssessed with fighting.
Then it's quite debatable whether
he's good-hearted or not.
Shut up, perverted old man!
What?! You're being rude
to a good-hearted man!
Shut up and make the
Super Saiyan God!
Although Vegeta was bad in the past,
how is he now?
Is he bad?
Come to think about it...
That guy hasn't done anything
bad recently.
Why is Kakarot the main?
Stop complaining!
Father, has anything changed?
I wonder...
Thank you for waiting.
This is Fried Shrimp?
Give me that as well.
Goku became a god!
Son, show us your power!
Stop it, Goku.
It's no use fighting.
That's no god.
But...
Your power level only increased because
everyone's energy transferred to you.
That's how it is, just because your power
level increased, it doesn't mean you're god.
I see.
As I expected...
I don't think we can win gainst
Beerus sama.
That can't be...
Do you understand everyone?
Think about it carefully.
Five people are suppose to let their energy
flow into one other.
That means you need
six saiyans, right?
Is that so, I miscalculated!
Six people?
We're missing one...
That's right, Vegeta you had
a little brother!
He's on a planet far away.
And I don't know where he is.
Did you not ask for his
mobile number?
That's enough,
I was expecting something fun.
I'm disappointed.
Since I'm tired,
I'm going to destroy Earth and return.
Wait, there is one more!
Videl, there's one more?
Umm, how should I put it...
Should I say one will become one?
But, there is without a doubt,
a Saiyan's blood flowing!
What are you talking about, Videl?
Your dad is great,
but he's a normal human!
Not you, dad!
Umm, Videl is carrying
a baby!
Really?!
It's true, I kept it a secret
to surprise you, Gohan.
Yay!!
Can you become a god or not?
Let's try again with Videl!
Would it be okay?
The baby hasn't even been born.
Anyways, let's try and see!
Yes.
Was it impossible?
Hey that's just normal Goku.
But look, his hair is red.
That's true, and he became thinner.
I can't read Goku's power level.
Congratulations, it seems
you've succeeded!
It was worth the wait.
Really?
Did I become a Super Saiyan God?
We'll know when we fight.
Come at me.
Okay, here I come!
Fine, if you're stronger,
I won't destroy Earth.
Really?
Thanks!
How does it feel to have
become a god?
I'm surprised.
Is that so, I'm shocked.
That's the same thought as I.
Good, that's it!
What's wrong, you look dissatisfied.
A little.
Do you dislike having become a god?
Yeah, for something like this to exist,
What do you mean?
it's something I wasn't able achieve alone.
Is that something to complain about?
Yeah! I'm dissatisfied!
What, is it an earthquake?
You're saying interesting things.
Do you dislike the fact that
your comrades had to help?!
I'm happy, happy but,
I wasn't able to fight you without
borrowing everyone's power.
That annoys me!
Then why did you become a God?
Because I wanted to
fight with Beerus sama!
Let's follow!
Yes!
Our Ki have recovered!
Are you still dissatisfied about
being a god?
Yeah!
That pride will be your weakness!
Such a terrible pride you have.
A saiyan with that kind of obssession
is rare.
Such power!
That's not entirely true.
Vegeta has much more pride than I!
Come to think of it, he threw away
that pride and protected everyone.
I know, for him to throw away
his pride as prince,
Isn't it amazing?
I respected him a little.
So did you throw away your pride as well,
and became a god?
That's how it is.
What are those two talking about?
It looks like Goku is receiving training.
I'll say it but, I also have a complaint.
What is it?
I have yet to fight in my
full power!
Really?
I used around 80%!
80%?!
In that case, would you be able to
keep up with this speed?!
What's wrong? Are you being serious?!
I'm being serious!
What is that, ranged attacks?!
We're not playing sports.
Don't enjoy destruction!
He returned to a normal Super Saiyan!
Krillin, can you see?
Krillin, can you see?
I can't see.
I can't see.

Don't hesitate and try.
That's Goku's Ka-me-ha-me-ha!
What?
Here's my return.
I'll block such a thing!
What is that?
It's Beerus's attack.
This is bad!
Crap!
It seems that you haven't realised.
Haven't realised what?
It's been a while since you lost your
Super Saiyan God powers.
He's right.
But...
It seems that while you were fighting
as a god,
you've absorbed that power into your body.
That's why when you transformed back,
your powers didn't decrease drastically.
You're really something.
I would even call you a rare being,
a genius!
That makes me happy, but...
In that case, be happy.
That's what you wanted, right?
I can't do that.
The biggest problem is...
The fact that there is a huge
difference in power!
Then, give up and surrender!
What's happening?
Crap!
Goku!
Goku!
Oi, what did you do just now?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You are certainly interesting.
What's up, why did you stop?
I wanted to say I lost to you.
Lost...?
I lost.
Beerus sama  you're really strong.
I didn't stand a chance.
You're certainly the universe's best!
You've finally realised the terrifying power of,
Beerus sama the God of Destruction.
Nevertheless, you were certainly strong too.
Up until now, you're the 2nd strongest
opponent I've faced in my long history of battles.
What, I'm 2nd?
Finally, I'll tell you something good.
What, you're not going to
destroy the Earth anymore?
I can't do that.
I never go back on my decisions.
Then, what?
It's about Whis, the guy
who looks after me.
He looks after me, but
he is also my teacher.
Teacher?
Then the universe's strongest...
This is the 7th Universe.
I am the 7th God of Destruction.
There are 12 Universes in total.
Don't you think there would be,
many more powerful beings?
Goku!
Goku!!
I'm okay, I'm still alive.
Then as promised,
I'll destroy Earth.
Beerus sama, you've destroyed
a very small portion of Earth.
Unfortunately, I've used up
most of my stamina.
I'll bring about complete destruction
next time.
Beerus sama!
You, when Beerus sama  faces death, wouldn't you
like to become the next God of Destruction?
Oi!
I'll have to reject that.
That's unfortunate.
Madame Bulma,
Me?
What is it?
Sorry for causing trouble.
Other than that, apologize for hitting me!
I'm sorry.
Oi, are you stupid?
If it's okay, invite me to another party.
Only if you promise not to run wild.
I understand, next time I will
definitely try that thing called pudding.
I'll put tons in the pool!
But don't say it tastes awful
after eating it!
If it's awful, I'll destroy Earth.
In that case, we'll be able to fight again,
right Beerus sama?
This is goodbye.
I can't believe it.
It's without a doubt.
The God of Destruction, Beerus sama,
didn't destroy!
As expected, was it because of
Son Goku's mysterious character?
He's gaining more comrades.
Even Beerus sama...
Putting other things aside,
I can't see the extent to his potential.
Though, it was nothing to worry about.
Even so, it's been a while since
I've seen you use 70% of your powers, Beerus sama.
What was he called again?
Son Goku.
Perhaps in the distant future,
he and Vegeta might become a real
enemy of threat.
Come to think about it, I brought
these Sushi because they were so delicious!
What a pleasant looking food~
You eat it with small amounts of this
thing called soy sauce.
What's this pile of green stuff?
Come to think about it, the chef said,
"Eat it depending on your preference."
I think it was called wasabi.
Come to think about it,
I heard something like that?
While I was fighting...
I'll bring something to drink.
Let's give it a taste.
You can't do that!
Please sleep for about three years.
Beerus sama, you have to brush your teeth
before going to sleep!
Okay, fine.
One more time!
Happy Birthday, Bulma!
38 years old!
Shut up!
When cornered, you just might be
the most fearsome being.
Oi, Kakarot.
Next time, I'm becoming God,
so cooperate!
Of course!
But if you push yourself to become
that strong, you'll collapse later!
Oh yeah, Vegeta.
When Bulma got hit, you shouted "My Bulma!"
and became a great Super Saiyan!
I felt loved~
I don't remember saying such a thing!
But, back then I definitely surpassed you!
Yeah, without a doubt!
Next time when we're fighting someone strong,
I'll ask them to hit Bulma!
Oi!
When Vegeta was like that,
you shouldn't have been there.
So you used instant transmission,
and watched from a distance.
Son?
Are you serious, bastard!
While everyone was being handed in!
Sorry, I wanted to strategize
before fighting the enemy!
Although I didn't remember anything.
Bulma, slap him two, no three more times!
Yes sir!
I'm sorry! I regret it!
Ka
Kame
Kameha
Kamehame
Kamehame HA!
