(woman) Alan, every
ten-year-old is afraid
of something.
(Alan) The kid's afraid
of tuna-fish sandwiches.
Mercury levels
in the tuna.
Whatever.
Alan, the world is
a frightening place
to him right now.
I think we could be
a little more supportive.
Supportive? I'm the most
supportive father on earth,
but I'm running out of
supportive things to do.
I signed him up
for Little League,
he drove everybody crazy
with statistics about how you
can develop tumors from being
hit in the head with a ball.
Did you know that shin splints
can lead to blood clots
in the legs?
Claire, he brought in
a medical journal. Nobody
wanted to play after that.
And now I'm building him
a tree house, in a tree
he refuses to climb.
You know he hates heights.
I don't know. I just
want to be a good father.
But you are
a good father.
(thunder rumbles)
(gasps) I'm OK! I'm OK!
(thunder crashes)
Aah! No, I'm not!
Hey, Rich!
(laughs) Well?
You like it?
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.
Hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?
No, come on up!
Look. Solid as a rock.
Dad, 8% of all household
accidents involve ladders.
Another 3% involve trees.
We're looking at
11% probability here.
Fine. Just put the bag
in the bucket, OK?
(resumes hammering)
Rich.
Huh?
Ow! (yells)
Oh! Oh!
Dad! Do you have feeling
in your toes?
Yes, I have feeling
in my toes.
Oh, Alan, honey,
are you OK?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Fine. Oh!
Can't argue with
statistics, Dad.
Statistics. Here's
something you can do:
go down to
Gutman's Hardware Store,
buy a pound of these.
But, Dad --
Son, you can't
live your life
based on statistics.
You've gotta
take some chances.
Now come on, buddy.
You can do this.
This is not good.
Definitely not good.
(lights chirp)
(warning device beeps)
(boy #1) All right!
(boy #2) Whoa!
Good one!
(boy #3) You went further
that time.
All right! Way to go, dude!
All right, line it up.
(warning beep stops)
Hey, guys, look,
it's Richie Tyler.
Hey, check out
his clothes.
Hey, Tyler, where
you going, the moon?
Get cable in
that thing, Tyler?
Hey, what's the matter,
you chicken?
(makes chicken noises)
What's the matter, wuss,
forgot your training wheels?
(laughter)
(gasps)
Uhh!
Uhh!
(thunder crashes)
(grunts)
(yells)
(gasps)
No cranial damage.
(warning beep stops)
Oh!
(roars)
(pants)
Hello?
(gasps)
(squeaking)
(wind howling)
Welcome to the library,
young man.
Don't tell me. You're here
for a special book.
Mister --
Stop, stop, stop.
Allow me to guess.
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.
You're in need of...
a fantasy.
Brave knights,
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.
Look, all I want is --
Adventure!
Of course. You're a boy
who loves adventure!
Brimming with
wicked demons,
cutthroat pirates --
No, no, that's not it.
Horror!
Ah, horror! Evil demons!
Wretched monsters!
Haunted houses!
Graveyards!
Yes.
It's horror for you, boy.
I'm sure of it.
Your library card, please.
I don't have one.
You do now.
Sign here.
Richard Tyler.
Consider this your passport
to the wonderful,
quite unpredictable
world of books.
But I don't
want any books.
Hmm?
That's what I'm
trying to tell you.
I only came in here
'cause of the storm.
You mean you don't need...
Oh.
I see.
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?
Through there.
Proceed in a
northeasterly direction
until you get to the rotunda,
and from there head west
through the fiction section.
And you'll find it.
A public telephone.
You can't miss it.
(wind blows eerily)
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way,
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.
(thunder)
(shoes squeak)
Wow!
Jeez!
(thunder)
Whoa! Oh!
Hello?!
(voice echoing)
(swordplay)
(horse gallops/neighs)
Uh-oh.
(falling droplets)
Huh?
Oh! Uhh!
(yells)
(roars)
(yells)
Uhh!
(yelling) Help!
Mister, mister,
where's the exit?!
(screams)
Help!
(yells)
(gasps)
Wha...? (gasps)
Huh?
I'm... I'm a cartoon!
You... are an illustration.
Who... who are you?
I am the Pagemaster,
keeper of the books
and guardian of
the written word.
(gasps) You're the guy
from up there!
Where are the others?
Why, they're here, of course!
And all around.
Maybe you can show me
the way out?
Follow me.
I-Is that the way?
Oh, the only way.
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!
Where a boy's imagination
can take root and grow
to incredible heights!
(grunting)
Where a boy's courage
is a wind that moves
him to discovery!
(men continue grunting)
And where
your journey begins!
Uhh! Whoa!
To find your way home,
you must face three tests:
horror, adventure
and fantasy.
And remember this:
when in doubt,
look to the books!
Aah! How do you
stop this thing?!
(man #1) I am the ghost
of Christmas past...
(man #2) All the pirates
shared a grave.
(crashing)
(phone off hook)
(moans)
(operator) Due to the storm,
all lines have been
temporarily disconnected.
Please try your
call again later.
(moaning) Oh! Ow!
(sighs) This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
(grunts)
(yells)
Where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?
Where's he be?! Where's he be?
So here be the lubber who
knocked me on me poop deck
and with no apologies, too!
(growls)
You fiction
or nonfiction?
(gasps) Uh, Richard.
Richard Tyler.
What kind of a book
would that be?
Uh, I'm not a book.
Got any proof?
(grunts)
See? Here's my name!
(gasps)
A library card!
Oh, begging your pardon,
lad. I didn't know
you was a customer!
Uh, look, all I wanna do
is get outta here.
(laughing) Of course you do,
matey! We all do.
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.
(thunderclap)
(librarian) Look to the books.
Look to the books.
(gasps)
You... you said you knew
the way out?
I know these waters like
the back of me hook!
(mutters)
Uh... Uh. This way.
I gotta get home.
My parents are probably
worried sick about me.
Well, I'm afeard I've been
dry-docked in this library
far longer than
I'd like to remember.
As I sees it, you with
your library card are
me ticket out of here!
Is it a deal, matey?
Ooh, I'm naked.
Uh, yeah, I guess so.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's the spirit, lad!
Can we get going now?
Aye aye!
Let's scale this mast
and get our bearings!
Mast? That's a ladder.
I kind of have this thing
about heights.
Huh. I'll take care of that.
(mutters)
Mysterious Island. Yes.
Kidnapped.
Ah, here we be!
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!
It's a giant squid!
(snarls)
Ah! Whoa!
Ooh! Jump, boy!
It's jump for your life!
(squid roars)
Ohh!
(gasping) Uhh!
(grunting)
(woman, muffled)
Let go of my face!
I can't breathe!
(muffled voice/gasps)
What are you doing,
grabbing me like that
and messing up
my pantyhose? Hmph.
Hmph. Now I gotta straighten
out my Little Mermaid underwear.
Who... who are you?
(grumpily) I'm Fantasy. Oh!
(clears throat)
(sweetly) I'm Fantasy!
What is this?
Hmm.
It's a library card.
(sarcastically) I'm a book,
honey, I can read.
(clears throat)
Now tell me,
what's the one thing
you wish for more than
anything in the world?
Anything in the world?
I-I'd like to get out of here.
I'll grant your wish, child.
But you must do me one small
kindness in return.
You gotta check me
outta here!
That's it? OK, let's go!
Do I have to click my heels
or something?
(laughs) Honey,
you in the wrong story.
That was a close one, lad. Lad?
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!
You know
that short story?
Yeah, he's adventure.
Honey, that's what they all say.
I heard that! I'll have
you know I'm a classic!
Mm-hmm. A classic... misprint.
Why, you old sea serpent!
I'll rip out your pages
and use them for... Oh, no!
Do something!
Hmm.
(Adventure yells)
Oops! (laughs) I forgot.
My wand doesn't always work
outside the fantasy section.
You mean you can't
wish us to the exit?
(groans) That overdue shrew's
never even seen the exit.
More than you have, shorty!
In fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. Hmph!
Then what are ye doing
in these parts?
There a witches' convention
around here, maybe?
Look, I was misshelved. (laughs)
But that's over, now that
young Prince Charming here
has come to check me out.
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!
Come on, boy, we're
wasting time chumming off
this dinghy.
It's on to
the exit for us!
If he thinks the exit's in
that direction, you know
it's got to be in this one!
Don't listen to her,
mate. She's not sailing
with a full crew!
Ah-ah-ah! (sneezes)
Fantasy!
She's a bloody nightmare.
Let's leave him. He doesn't
even know where we are now!
Bilge water! Of course
I know where we are! We're...
Hound of the Baskervilles.
Ha! We're in Baskervilles.
Have a look-see!
Hmm. Huh?
(barks/growls)
(screams)
Hey, this way!
Through here!
Nice doggy! Good doggy!
Hurry!
(grunts)
(barks)
(all panting)
(sighs) Oh, baby.
Are we still in the library?
Aye, lad,
the horror section.
It looks pretty scary.
That it does.
Just stay close to me and...
and you got nothing
to worry about.
(sarcastically) Mm-hmm.
There it is! The exit! (pants)
(sighs)
Looks like the only way
to reach the exit is
through that there house.
No way I'm going in there.
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.
Yeah, but 70%
of all accidents
are household-related.
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.
Whoa!
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.
(gasps)
Well? Ring the bell.
(pants)
(doorbell chimes)
Ohh!
Good catch!
Here, take it.
Isn't he sweet?
(makes kissing sounds)
Oh, I scared you.
I'm sorry!
You mustn't judge a book
by its cover.
Look, he's smiling!
(laughing)
That's a smile?
All right, teatime's over.
Let's start
navigating this house.
Huh? No, wait!
Don't go in there!
It's scary inside!
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!
I'm afraid.
Of what?
Of, of... (yells)
And... Aah!
And... (makes creepy noise)
And... (imitates
woman screaming)
Uh, I know how you feel.
Horror always has sad endings.
I come from a world
of happy endings.
Why don't you
come with us?
Yeah! And maybe you could
help us through the house.
Through the house? Hm. Uh.
You can do it.
'Kay.
Friend?
(gulps)
(gasps) Oops!
Come on!
(laughs)
(sings indistinctly)
(gasps)
Hmm?
(mutters indistinctly)
(shivers)
He-hello?
A-anybody home?
(door slams shut)
(all gasp)
What was that?
(screeches) Nevermore!
Get me out of here!
May I assist you
in some way?
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.
Well, sir, we did
ring the bell.
It's all my fault.
I was trying to help them
find their way to
the other side of the house.
The other side?
My boy, I derive no pleasure
in telling you that
you are in extreme danger.
Danger?
Even as we speak.
Lurking in this very room,
waiting to strike,
are forces of evil.
(gasps)
(screams) Wait for me!
Wait for me!
Every man is possessed of
both good... and evil.
(suavely) Oh, yes.
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?
Hmm?
Ah.
I'll have a go
with you, doc.
Ooh!
Stay back!
This is a man's drink!
(laughs) Can I have the olive?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
Now look what you've done!
Whoa!
Ooh!
No! No, no!
Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!
(gasps)
(yelling)
(moaning)
(all gasp)
(moans)
(laughs)
(laughs maniacally)
Dr... Jekyll?
Dr. J?
My name is... Mr. Hyde!
(all gasp/scream)
Easy, there!
(yelps)
The stairs, mateys,
the stairs!
Ahh!
Help, master!
Don't leave me!
This is no way to treat
a library book. Sanctuary!
Sanctuary!
(laughs maniacally)
Sanctuary!
Honey, you got to help him!
But I-I...
Oh!
At least this wand
is good for something.
Come on!
Which way?
Down.
Definitely down.
No, up, definitely up!
Up, up, up!
Come on!
(gasping)
What's going on?
Ghost stories.
(screaming)
Ha ha!
Get me outta here!
Aah!
Close the door!
Whoa!
Down there? I-I can't.
Come on, boy!
Even books have spines.
Come, master!
I can do this.
I can do this.
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
(growls)
(Pagemaster's voice) Reach deep
within yourself, Richard.
Seize the courage.
Uhh! Uhh!
Whoa!
Yay! You did it!
You did it!
Grand, boy!
(laughing)
Hooray, hooray, hooray.
Wow.
(chuckles)
(breathes deeply)
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.
Ha ha! The land
of adventure!
Look! There's the exit!
(all chuckling)
(chuckling)
Hey! Wait for me!
Ha ha ha!
Home, sweet home!
There's only room
for one up here.
From now on,
it'll be smooth sailin'!
(laughing)
What are ya laughin' at?
(laughing)
Whoa!
Uhh!
A boat!
Is it... safe?
I wrote the book on sailin'.
In fact, I am
the book on sailin'.
I'm impressed.
(laughing)
We're sinking.
We're going down!
Somebody do something!
(wailing)
Thank you.
Shove off, lads!
(dd accordion)
(Rich) Jeez, the water
looks kind of choppy.
Maybe we should've stayed
back there where it was safe.
(plays discordant note)
Whalin' men.
(men grunting)
(Adventure)
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!
Another guy with a peg leg.
Mm-hmm. Seems to be
a fashion statement
around here.
Did you see it?!
(Rich) See what?!
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.
Hmm?
Moby Dick!
Thar she blows!
I grin at thee,
thou grinning whale!
(gasps) He's possessed!
He's insane!
He's my kind of guy!
(grunting)
Look!
It's headed
straight for them!
Thou damned whale!
Thus, I give up the spear!
(growls)
So, you think
I scared it?
He shouldn't swim
right after eating,
you know.
He'll get cramps.
Where did he go?
Aah!
Row! Row for your lives!
(screaming)
(coughing)
Guys! Where are you?!
(panting)
(screaming)
(sputtering)
Adventure? Boy, am I
ever glad to see you.
Huh?
All right, all right!
Where's Horror?
And Fantasy?
Where are they?
I searched for 'em
as much as I could, mate.
I'm afraid...
I'm afraid they've gone
below with Davy Jones.
No, it can't be.
You guys are the only
friends I've ever had.
(sniffling)
She's a cruel sea, lad.
They gotta be out there.
Horror!
Fantasy!
Sharks!
(gasping)
We may be joining them
other two sooner
than you think.
Hey, look!
Help, help! Over here!
Careful, mate. Not all sharks
are in the water.
Get us out of here!
(grunts)
This way! Help!
(chuckling evilly)
It's a good thing
you guys came along.
Ohh! We're missing
two others about his size.
Did you see 'em?
He's all the catch
we've had today.
(growls)
(laughing)
(blows whistle)
Huh?
(whistle blows in distance)
I knew it! It's him!
Who?
The meanest, black-hearted
pirate that ever sailed
the seven seas.
Long John Silver!
(cackling)
(cocks gun)
Just set your keel down, mate.
John Silver's
expecting live company.
(cackling)
Uhh!
Give the word,
Cap'n Silver, sir,
and I'll show you
the color of his insides.
Red! Red! They're red!
Stow your cutlass,
Tom Morgan.
I want a better look
at his outsides first.
Long John Silver!
Aye, lad,
the very same.
Well, seeing as how
me men plucked you
out of the water
like a drownin'
field rat,
you'll be joinin'
our happy family
as our new cabin boy.
Thanks, but I already
have a family.
I really should be
getting home now.
Oh, I think
you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.
John Silver! Touch one hair
on that boy's head,
and you'll be answerin' to me!
(laughs)
Well, come aboard,
matey! Ha ha.
Uhh!
You wouldn't happen to be
going after me treasure,
would you, now?
You ain't got any treasure
worth goin' after!
No treasure?
No treasure?
He's lyin'! There's plenty
of treasure for all of ya!
Search him!
The boy, too.
(pirates laughing)
(dd accordion)
Hmm. Why, looky here.
Here he be, Cap'n.
What might this here be?
Money! It's yours! Keep it!
Money, he says!
Keep it, he says!
(laughing hysterically)
Hmm. Library card.
Library card?
A cabin boy don't need
no library card.
(laughs)
(screeches)
(gasping)
I'd like to get out of here!
Land ho!
Land ho!
There she be, mateys!
Treasure Island!
(cheering)
(laughing)
Stay on your toes, mate.
When they go for the gold,
we'll make our break.
Quit your squawkin'!
Look to the map.
What's it say?
It's, uh, in the middle
by the waterfall.
No, it's east
by some broccoli.
Give me that!
Broccoli.
You half-wits,
that's west by a tree!
(muttering)
Oh, east by broccoli.
(parrot) They're all idiots.
(gasps)
What sort of way is that
for bones to lie?
It ain't natural.
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.
Open your eyes.
The bones is the compass
pointin' the way
to the doubloons.
(all gasp)
(laughing hysterically)
It's gone!
Dig deeper, boys!
(Long John) I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!
One gold piece. This is
your treasure, is it?
Let's kill him
and eat his parrot.
Stand by for trouble.
We mighta known
you'd double-cross us.
(parrot squawks)
Throw down your weapons,
John Silver!
Why, you pack of
back-bitin' dogs.
You'll be regrettin' this,
George Merry.
Save your speeches.

Whew. Oh, I wish

Boy, I thought

We almost were,
until this enchanting fellow
discovered he could float.
It's hollow.
(grunting)
Who's there?
Adventure!
Adventure who?
What do you mean,
Adventure who?!
Open the blasted door,
you dog-eared...
Aah!
(chuckles) Perfect timing.
I was just thanking
these guys for saving us.
(growls)
I coulda taken
the lot of 'em
with one hand
tied behind me back.
That's just his way
of saying thanks.
You're welcome!
Ahoy, matey!
Aye, we're lusty
adventurous men.
Go away. You don't know
what you're talkin' about.
I-I know I'm not
your favorite kind of book,
but I could be
just like you.
You'll never be Adventure!
Ye ain't got
the spine for it.
And take that
stupid thing off!
Sorry.
(muttering) Oh, he thinks
he can be a pirate.
(sighs)
(sighs)
(Pagemaster's voice)
Seize the courage, Richard,
then you will reach the exit.
I'll never get home.
You did good, honey.
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.
I'll never get
to the exit now.
Honey, never say "never"
around Fantasy,
because sometimes
you've got to fight
to make a wish come true.
So come on.
Don't quit on me now.
Yeah.
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.
You don't see me
pretending to be Horror.
(groans)
(gasps/grunts)
Why are you sittin' around
like a bunch of ol' wenches
at teatime?!
Pick one.
Mmm...
That one.
(chuckles)
My library card!
I wrestled it away
from three sharks
who was eyein' it
for breakfast,
at no small threat
to me life, neither.
Mm-hmm.
Where's Horror?
Wasn't he with you?
He was, but he, uh...
I mean, I sort of, uh...
He, uh...
What did you say
to him now?!
Well, I, uh, I, uh,
I just, uh, uh...
I'll go find him.
Yeah, you better
go find him.
And be quick about it!
Horror!
Horror!
(gasps) Horror!
(Adventure) Horror.
(chattering)
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!
(shouting)
You're lucky I was published
with a thick hide!
Hmm?
(shouts)
(screaming)
Come back, ya jellyfish!
(sighing)
Speak to me, mate.
Ye had a good heart
and ye was braver
than ye knew.
I'd walk the plank
if I thought it would
bring him back.
That's beautiful.
Huh?
This is too cute.
Uhh!
Are you OK?
Thanks to my friend here.
Get off me!
Did you see that?
See what?
My wand! It's blinkin'!
That can only mean
one thing.
The exit!
The checkout!
A happy ending.
Ohh!
(Horror laughing)
(laughs) Let's go!
Come on!
Are you sure that
swizzle stick of yours
is workin' right?
Hmm. I don't know.
Maybe we should test it.
You've gone overboard,
missis!

Look! Mother Goose!
(Fantasy) Hey, girl!
dd Leave all our doubts
and fears behind...
Hello, my little baby. Hi!
dd You see, that's just
what can happen
dd If you look inside your mind
dd There's no limit
to the wonders
dd You can find
dd Whatever you imagine
dd Can make your life brand-new
dd There are miracles waiting
dd So keep concentrating
dd And I promise you
that if you do...
(splatter)
dd Whatever you imagine
can come true dd
Wait for me!
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!
Hey! Don't go up there!
What's the matter?
Is Adventure afraid
to go in?
What?! I live for
moments like this.
(sighs)
(gasps)
Look! There it is! The exit!
(grumbling)
(gasps)
Me sword! Uhh!
(humming)
(grunting)
(rumbling)
(screaming)
Earthquake!
(grunting)
(screaming)
(yelling)
(roaring)
Quick! Find page 1,001.
Arabian Nights?
That's it!
Ohh!
Get the boy!
(screaming)
(grunting)
Come on!
The exit's up there!
(grunting)
(screaming)
We're gonna make it!
Hooray! We're gonna make --
Aah!
My wand!
Oh, baby. I wish
that hadn't happened.
(yelling)
(crash)
(grunting)
Come on, guys! The exit!
(all groaning)
This way, guys!
(gasps)
Aah!
We're almost there!
We made it!
Guys?
This dragon is history!
Don't try to stop me!
Be careful.
Huh? Hmm.
(giggles)
You really are a classic.
(gasps)
(chuckles)
Mmm!
(sighs)
How would you like
to curl up with
a good book?
(smack)
(grunting)
Me binding!
In your dreams!
Ooh!
Adventure, up here!
Go on, lad! Save yourself!
You think a bag of hot air
is enough to stop me?!
Dragon. He's more like
a dragonfly, he is!
And with big teeth!
Look out!
(gasping)
(growling)
(humming)
Uhh.
Happy birthday.
(sighs)
(growls)
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!
A sword.
Yes!
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!
Bite him, bite him!
(barks)
Aah!
Yah!
Watch out for his tail!
(Adventure) You've got
him on the run!
Aah!
(grunting)
I'm not scared of you!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh?
(coughing)
Aah!
(coughs)
I gotta get out of here.
(grunting)
Aah!
Fantasy's wand!
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.
Uh-oh.
(ghostly voice)
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books.
Look to the books!
Alice in Wonderland.
Off with his head!
Sheesh!
Mnh-mnh.
Mnh-mnh.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Yeah! This is it!
(gasping)
I hate heights!
Aah!
Matey!
He's alive!
Aah!
Come on, guys!
Uhh!
(laughing)
(grunting)
Whew.
Are you all right?
Wh-wha...?
Master, you saved us!
That ya did, matey.
(gasps)
Baby, you're the greatest.
Mmwah!
Who's there?
The Pagemaster.
Hey! How'd you get here?
Quit it! We're in
the presence of
the Pagemaster.
I know who he is!
He's the guy who did
all this to me!
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?
Tell me.
I was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.
I was made a slave by
a bunch of mangy pirates
and eaten -- got that?
Eaten by
a fire-breathing dragon.
He don't mean it,
my Pagemaster.
He don't mean it.
Not to mention being
tossed, squashed and scared
practically to death.
Yet you stand before me.
Well... yeah.
Think, boy! What kind of
an adventure would you have had
if I brought you here
with a turn of a page?
(cackling)
(all gasp)
(laughing)
You prevailed over evil.
Ah, you looked Moby Dick
in the eye, boy.
Ah, you had pirates tough,
me lad, and don't no one
speak any different.
If I had brought you
here from the start,
you never would have
found the courage
to face your own fears.
(roars)
And in doing so,
you triumph here and always.
Hey, is that... That's me!
That was you.
I'm ready to go home now.
(sighs)
I mean, we're ready.
The world awaits.
Whoa!
Godspeed to you, boy!
Wait for me!
(yelling)
Aah!
(Pagemaster's voice)
You took quite a spill,
young man.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Careful!
You'll slip again!
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Wait! Uh, I forgot
something.
Here.
I'm afraid you can
only check out two.
Horror? But I promised him.
You promised whom?
Look, I need...
Just this once?
Shh.
(whispering) I have
a talent for guessing
what people need.
Just this once.
Shh.
Yes!
Good. That was definitely good.
(Claire) I can't imagine
where he could be.
Maybe we should
call the police.
(gasps) Alan!
He's home.
Alan.
It's impossible.
(owl hooting)
Rich?
We probably should
put him in his bed.
Let's let him sleep
up here tonight.
Love you, Richie.
Good night, son.
(Horror) It's dark out here.
I wish there was a night-light.
(Fantasy) Honey,
wish granted.
(gasps) Ooh.
(laughing)
Hooray! Hooray!
(breathes deeply)
Breathe it in, mateys.
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.
(crying)
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?
Because I have friends.
(sniffles)
(chuckles)
That you do, matey.
Aye, that you do.
Ahem. You know what would
make this a happy ending?
A kiss.
OK. (smacks kiss)
I meant from her!
(laughing)
