Previously on Supergirl...
Mr. Olsen is stable.
Who is the next of kin?
I'm Kelly Olsen, James' sister.
If we don't help him,
James is gonna die.
You're asking me to work
with you to save him?
I can save both you and him.
You have to be just like her.
Move like her, think like her.
_
Promote peace, my son.
If you don't stand up and
fight, you'll lose everything.
I am not a man of peace.
Otis, find me a real American.
Someone charismatic.
I think I know just the guy.
Name's Ben Lockwood.
Miss Tessmacher!
Eve.
Lena.
She's alive. Get the EMTs up here now.
Director, there's a letter.
It's from Lex Luthor.
Stay with her.
"Dear Lena,
I wish I could say it wasn't personal
planting a spy,
stealing your research,
but it is."
Lex was working with Eve Tessmacher.
- Oh, my God.
- She's coming to.
Lena, hey, are you okay?
- I think so.
- Look at me.
Alex.
Alex, I've got to tell you about Lex.
He escaped from prison,
he attacked you,
and he stole your research, we know.
No, that's not the whole story...
Hey, uh-uh, don't move.
And, yes, we know
that Eve was his spy.
Yes, but I gotta tell you...
You've been through trauma.
So, please, just try to relax.
I'm sorry.
You have nothing to apologize for.
Supergirl is searching for Lex.
She will find him.
I checked the whole South Pacific.
No sign of Lex or his helicopter.
Kal left me here to protect Earth
and I let his arch-nemesis
slip through my fingers.
Everything that Lex does now
is because I failed.
I'm gonna cast a psychic net.
I might be able to detect them.
J'onn...
J'onn?
J'onn, are you okay? J'onn!

Thank you for saving me.
Why do you think this happened?
I told you the other night...
I am no longer a man of peace.
When I took Manchester's life,
I realized that I was done
trying to be my father.
But now that I have clarity
as to who I am not,
I no longer have clarity
as to who I am.
You think that caused you
to lose your powers?
There is an ancient story
about a race of shapeshifters
whose planet was destroyed.
They had to
constantly change shape to survive.
For generations, they did this.
Until, one day,
they forgot their true form...
and all that goes with it.
History, culture, all sense of self.
They even forgot
the name of their race.
I am a shapeshifter, too, Kara.
The same thing could happen to me.
There must be something we can do.
I heard my father's voice when I fell.
The Staff of K'hollar
was with him when he died.
Maybe I could use its power
to summon his spirit for counsel.
No.
Lex is out there.
I need to help you find him.
No, no, you are always helping
everyone around you.
Right now, you just need
to take care of yourself.
They dress their patients
in business attire in this hospital?
That's funny.
No, actually,
I got a clean bill of health
from the docs about an hour ago, so...
Why didn't you call me?
'Cause you'd have
wanted to take me home.
And the world has turned upside down
since I've been here,
so I need to get to work. So...
James, are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
You were shot. You almost
died on the operating table.
Look, this isn't a broken leg.
You need to pay attention
to what's going on.
Kelly, I said I'm fine.
I'm a psychologist
that specializes in trauma.
This is my job.
And my job is to cover
the Alien Amnesty repeal.
There are thousands of Americans,
the government's trying
to take away their rights,
and nobody's paying attention
because Lex is out there.
I just need to make sure that
people know what's going on.
So I need to get to work,
I'll call you later.
How long do you think it's gonna take
them to find Lex Luthor this time?
Find Lex... Oh, no, no, no,
put your phone down, son.
What we're doing here,
this is the real news.
We are making history.
Mr. Lockwood,
Senator Granberry's office
just called,
can you stop by there today?
Tell her I'll be right there.
What do you say, son, you
want to watch another senator
tell your father
how he's doing good work?
It's pretty cool.
Breach of protocol.
It's a perimeter breach.
Stay sharp.
It could be Lex Luthor.
Supergirl?
What does she want?
I forgot how loud those were.
Everyone, stand down.
I, uh...
I come offering donuts and my help.
Lex usually attacks within
the first 48 hours of escaping.
Now, I know we've had our differences,
but I think we should team up
to catch him.
While I do appreciate a good
cinnamon cruller, Supergirl,
the President has ordered us to
redirect manpower to Washington, D.C.
For security.
In case of any unrest
after the repeal vote.
So, who's looking for Lex?
FBI, CIA, US Marshals.
I believe SEAL Teams one through six.
Everyone but us.
Lex had superpowers when I fought him.
He is more dangerous than
ever, and he will strike.
Maybe I can help Supergirl.
With support from Agent Dox,
I can direct the D.C. operation
from the field.
No, I can run point on D.C.,
cover where necessary.
You focus on finding Lex.
Don't make me regret this.
I've been doing scans of the skies,
but I'm not finding anything.
But most criminal organizations
have a weak link.
You're right.
Eve Tessmacher was working with Lex.
Lena knows her better than any of us.
- Let's go talk to her.
- Um...
Lena has been through
quite the ordeal.
And given the fact that you two
don't have the cleanest history,
I think it's better if I talk to her.
Right.
Uh, if she gives you a lead,
press this once and I'll be there.
You press it twice,
I'll know not to come.
Nia is at the fortress
trying to dream up
what Lex's plan might be,
but so far nothing.
We'll keep a secret
communication open with her
in case she's successful.
Oh, oh, I almost forgot.
J'onn wanted me
to give this back to you.
Ah.
I can't tell you how much
it means to have this back.
- Thank you.
- Keep it close.
You never know when you might need it.
We're closed.
Can't you read the sign?
It's on the door.
The sign.
Damn sign.
It says we're closed!
Ah, J'onn, my son.
Let's have a little chat, shall we?
This is a very nice office.
It reminds me
of the library at
the University of Z'onn Z'orr.
You're here.
I don't believe it.
Weren't you trying to contact me?
Yes, but I thought
I might hear a voice or feel...
a presence, I didn't...
think you'd actually...
be here.
I am.
I'm so glad.
I'm so glad.
I've been so lost.
So, so confused about my identity.
I, I tried to follow your example.
I really tried to follow.
I studied the Sacred Symbols,
I, I counseled everybody,
everybody to be peaceful.
But it just didn't work.
And, and, now, I'm at an impasse.
I... please... I need guidance.
That's not why I'm here.
Then what, why did you come?
Because you failed.
You were supposed to be the
keeper of the Sacred Symbols.
A holy man, a man of peace,
but you said you are
not a man of peace,
so I've come to take the Symbols back.
If you take the Sacred Symbols,
Martian history
will disappear forever.
Hmm, a shame. I'm taking them now.
No wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Well, you can't.
They're inside my mind.
No.
They're here on the table.
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.
Wait...
We interrupt our
coverage of the Alien Amnesty repeal
with an update on the
manhunt for Lex Luthor.
Sources say his sister,
Lena Luthor, is a victim.
Authorities found Ms. Luthor
late last night
in her office, drugged and bound.
Lex Luthor is considered
extremely dangerous
and any information
should be immediately reported.
Lena, I wasn't expecting you.
All the reports say you were
knocked unconscious.
You were always prone to migraines.
Is your head okay?
Spare me the concerned mother act.
Just tell me where Lex is.
Do you have to be so emotional?
It's disappointing.
I know you're upset
that Lex outsmarted you.
He hurt your poor little heart.
Well, at least, I have a heart.
An overrated organ.
Romanticized by poets
and frivolous women.
You're no better than simpering
Eve Tessmacher
chasing Lex like a lovesick puppy.
So Eve is in love with Lex.
Your brother gave you every
opportunity to work with him.
To come back into the fold,
and you turned him down.
I will never be on
the same side as you and Lex.
Of course not.
The only side you'll ever be on
is the side of your friends.
The Danvers sisters,
Jimmy Olsen.
Oh, what those besties would think
if they knew what
you've really been up to.
Ah.
I can only imagine what went down.
Weeks helping Lex.
Recrafting the drug you claimed
would save humanity.
To save him.
The two of you working side by side.
I can smell your fear, Lena.
Doing everything in your power
to make sure
your friends never
find out your complicity.
They would hate you.
And then you'd find yourself
utterly alone.
Again.
This is foolish.
You don't know anything.
Because Lex has deserted you.
I may be in prison,
but I'm not the one
who's going to be deserted.
Hey, there you are.
I went to look for you
at the hospital,
but they said you already left.
I got better.
I thought the FBI had already
gone through this.
Have you changed your mind about me?
No, of course not.
I came to ask for your help.
I'm sorry.
It's been a day.
Well, I have been tasked
with tracking down Lex.
And I'd like to ask you
about Eve Tessmacher.
You're gonna use Eve to get to Lex.
I think she's the weak link.
I want in on the investigation.
Lena, you were just assaulted.
Yeah, and I'm not a cop,
but I know Eve.
Okay.
But you should know that I'm
working with Supergirl on this.
Finding Lex is more important
than any differences we may have.
- Yeah.
- I know just where to start.
So this is the team.
Yes, Lena has joined us.
Uh, so why are we in 'burbs?
Well, I realized that Eve
is in love with Lex.
Crazy Lex-girlfriend.
Which indicates her heart
drives her actions.
And she spoke fondly
of an elderly aunt,
her only family in the city.
Mary Tessmacher.
This is her house.
Eve used to visit every Sunday.
So Eve might still be
in contact with her.
Good lead.
Can I help you ladies?
Thank you very much.
Senator Granberry, good to see you.
Thanks for coming.
This is your son.
George Lockwood, ma'am.
I was just giving him an intro on
how things get done in Washington.
As a matter of fact,
we were just talking about
how this repeal is moving even faster
than the Homestead Act of...
1862.
1862.
I've changed my mind.
I'm not voting for the repeal.
Excuse me? What?
Uh, okay.
But if...
If you vote no, then your
block's gonna vote no,
and that's eight votes we'll lose.
If we suddenly strip rights
from powerful aliens,
how are they gonna react?
Badly.
If they protest, revolt,
and we have a war on our hands,
then that is bad for humans.
I understand,
you're acting out of fear.
But maybe, just maybe
you should fear the common man.
Agent Liberty may play
to your steel town base,
but not here.
Welcome to Washington.
You're awake.
You're still here.
How is this even possible?
I only stayed because you fainted.
Now that you've
regained consciousness,
I'm going.
Wait, you can't just leave.
After everything we went through,
for you to pass the Symbols onto me...
You can imagine how disappointed I was
when you resorted to violence.
That's why I was
trying to contact you.
I need your help.
I'm trying to...
I'm trying to figure out
who I'm supposed to be.
The easiest question in the world.
What's the answer?
For you?
No idea.
You figure it out.
I ask you for help and all you do
is turn up and you make it worse.
I'm the last Green Martian.
If I lose myself,
we not only lose Martian religion,
we lose everything.
Our entire history.
Every memory you ever gave me.
My wife.
My daughters.
So this is urgent.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I know what will solve this problem.
What? What? What?
A nice hot cup of c'off'ee.
What?
I'll stay for one.
Oh, Mary's in Florida
soaking up the rays,
and I'm plant sitting.
Is Mary in some kind of trouble?
No, uh, not at all.
We're just here
because of her niece, Eve.
Do you know her?
Well, she's my fave cousin and
bowling bud at the fam reunion.
There's no way she's really
involved with that Lex Luthor.
- He's a creeper.
- What was your name again?
Bitsie, with an I-E.
Do you have any daughters, Bitsie?
Yes, twins.
They're at camp.
I miss those little chipmunks.
When was the last time you saw Eve?
Months ago.
Oh, unless you count seeing her
gorgeous mug splashed across the news.
She always said how amazing it was
to work for you, Ms. Luthor.
Were you sick at all, Bitsie?
Me? Healthy as a horse. Why?
Uh, just something Eve
said about a cousin
with cancer who had two daughters.
My blood orange cake. Want some?
I can never turn down cake.
She's lying.
Her heart's as fast
as a hummingbird's.
Yeah, I think so too.
Uh, Bitsie, your... Your hands.
Oh, ow!
Ahhh!
Your hands should be scalded,
they're not even red.
You were sick.
You were on hospice.
Eve cured you with the
serum I made for James.
She was here.
I want you out of my aunt's house!
I drink a lot of milk?
- Oh.
- Drop it.
You can't take it out of me.
I don't want to be sick again.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hey, we are not here to hurt you.
Eve saved me. She's good.
I hear you.
But if the world is wrong about Eve,
then tell us what's right.
Eve came here when she was on the
run from you and the police.
She risked getting caught to help me.
She did a good thing for you.
But the longer she's with Lex,
the more trouble she's in,
and the more danger.
Help us find her.
I don't know where she went.
But I know she used to work out of
a lab at National City University.
Eve had a secret lab?
Seems there are a lot of things
about Eve that were secret.
This way...
Ah. A-ha!
Okay, when you get the signal,
go that way exactly 900 meters.
I speak English better than you.
Whatever. It's not a contest.
And put this on first.
What?
You really look exactly like her.
Wow, I could fit ten of my
apartments into this office.
Yeah, it's not bad, huh?
What you got there?
Referrals for
post-trauma psychologists.
All in National City.
Come on. Come, look...
Look, Kelly, I told you,
I don't need help.
I don't need help.
James, Lex tried to kill you
eight times.
If you would just listen to me
for once in your life,
maybe you would realize this
has nothing to do with Lex.
James, you have a wall full of
televisions and they're all off.
Because you know that
if you turn them on,
you'll see Lex's face
staring back at you.
- Oh, is that right?
- You are avoiding a trigger.
Lex came after me in the first place
to get to Superman
who's off planet.
Manchester Black shot me,
who's dead now,
so I'm no longer in danger, thank you.
But you are irritable, jumpy, sweaty,
all psychological responses
to triggers.
And those are just the symptoms
that I can see.
God forbid you have a flashback.
'Cause I know you'd never tell me.
Wow.
You know,
you're not the only one
who can analyze things, Kelly.
The only times
that you've come to visit me
are when I was in the hospital.
Because I was weak and you could
tell me what to do, right?
James, I'm just trying to help.
Then help me by listen...
I'm sorry.
I should, I...
I'm just, I'm busy,
I'm overwhelmed, I'm just...
This, this is, uh...
This is probably a really
good time for you to go home.
Whole room's lined with lead.
Eve may not have been tidy,
but she was smart.
Maybe not that smart.
That's Harun-El.
Yes. It is.
You kept this?
My mother told you
how dangerous it is.
I didn't keep it.
I gave your mother what I had,
but I made more
so I could realize its potential.
All of my current research
is based on this.
This is how Lex had powers.
Is that a part of your research, too?
This is why I didn't
want to work with you.
Because every time I think things
are getting better with us,
you display an inherent
distrust of my intentions.
What is so wrong about helping
humans protect themselves?
Because someone like Lex could
get ahold of the technology
and use it for evil,
which is exactly what happened.
You look past all of the good
we've done
and see red whenever
you feel vulnerable.
Lena saved Argo with this.
She rescued Sam,
she cured Bitsie's cancer,
and she saved James' life.
You're right.
- Excuse me?
- You're right.
If you hadn't made Harun-El,
James wouldn't be alive,
and you saved him in a way I couldn't.
I do see red sometimes,
and it's not an ego thing
or allegiance,
or anything like that.
I feel the weight of the world
on my shoulders.
And since Superman left,
and Lex has been free,
it feels a lot heavier.
If my enemies are strengthened,
if I'm weakened in the slightest bit,
I could lose.
And I just can't...
I can't lose.
I'm sorry, Lena.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
Bygones?
Bygones.
So what's the answer?
H'ronmeer save me. This again?
I need guidance.
Why won't you help me?
Why should I?
I'm not the one who failed
at the one task I have.
Or was it another Green Martian
who erased the mind
of the DEO colonel,
who reached into Manchester Black's
brain to inflict pain upon him,
and opened a channel for him
to access your mind
so he could defile my grave site
and steal the Staff of K'hollar,
which he could've
used to destroy planet Earth?
Everything I did,
I did in the name of peace.
- You killed him.
- He was a killer.
Then so are you.
Well, what would you have me do?
Sit around and pray all day
while the world around me burns
like you did on Mars?
At least I didn't run.
I have been trying
to make up for that.
By protecting this planet.
Trying
and failing.
If I'm such a failure, why did
you trust me with the Symbols?
Because you said you could handle it.
You insisted...
I shouldn't have!
I tried to be you, Father,
but I can't!
And you should never have asked me.
I'm not a man of peace!
And if that means I have
to give up the Symbols,
and Martian religion
has to die, then so be it.
At least I will know who I am!
And who are you?
I'm the Martian Manhunter!
Yes.
You are.
The blueprints to my mother's prison.
Ugh, okay, did Eve ever
mention, like, a family pet?
Um...
Here.
"I love Lex"?
Gross.
Truly.
All right,
let's see what Eve was up to.
Uh...
Is that her experiment log?
Looks like she was trying
to extract my serum
from someone after treatment.
Look at this.
It's a Cadmus-13.
It's the same type of gun
that shot James.
Oh, Metallo Protocol.
Lex and Eve were trying to use
Cadmus' Metallo technology.
And look whose name
is on the test subject list.
Otis Graves.
That must be how they
brought him back to life.
Well, he wasn't the first one.
Looks like there were five
failed test subjects before him.
What do you think happened to them?
Alex, no!
I'll distract him
and you make a run for it.
No, the Kryptonite will kill you.
I should've brought grenades.
I think I can make one with
some help from your stun gun.
Go!
Hey, Franken Berry.
Not donuts, I presume.
No, don't, don't.
That's a Kryptonite heart.
It was used to reanimate
the second Metallo.
And the first.
And possibly Otis.
Much better than donuts.
Wait, Eve Tessmacher was
working with Otis Graves,
and Otis Graves was working
with Agent Liberty, correct?
So even Lex might have
a connection to Ben Lockwood.
Well, transitive
property strikes again.
I need to have a chat with Lockwood.
See what his connection
to Eve and Lex might be.
I'll talk to Lillian.
It's the last thing I wanna do,
but she gave me some info
on Otis a while ago,
and she always knows
more than she says.
Before you go,
they ran a ballistics test on the
Cadmus-13 gun you found in Eve's lab.
It's a definite match
to the bullet that shot James.
Eve shot James?
Which means that Lex
was behind this, as well.
But why?
Just when you think you've got
to the bottom of Eve's betrayal,
it gets deeper and deeper.
James deserves to know who shot him.
That his attacker's still out there.
I'll tell him before I go to D.C.
We will find Eve.
I promise.
You tricked me into getting angry.
You were angry already.
Just pushing it down.
And you were right
to be angry with me, J'onn,
I wasn't clear.
I said I wished
for you to promote peace,
but I never intended
for you to become me.
I meant only that
you should help the world
in whatever state is true to you.
When I found you again,
I was so proud of the Martian
you had become.
I never meant to make you feel
you had to change, J'onn.
I'm sorry.
I failed to impart my
unconditional love for you.
I'm so sorry I couldn't be the keeper
of the Sacred Symbols, Father.
Hmm.
You were able to keep the
Symbols alive a little longer.
That brought comfort
to an old Martian.
The important thing is,
you know who you are.
Maybe there's another way.
H'ronmeer gave us the Symbols in
the heart of the desert of T'ozz.
I could return them there.
A hard journey.
And if you succeed,
they will lie dormant
until someone worthy
comes to claim them.
Maybe somebody will.
Hmm.
Thank you, Father, for all your help.
You know, J'onn,
I'm just an extension
of your memory of me.
Any answers you found,
they came from inside you.
Yeah, I know.
But it was still
really good to see you.
It was good to see you, too...
Martian Manhunter.
Hey.
How's the hunt for Eve coming?
Well, um,
we found out she revived Otis,
which connects her to Ben Lockwood,
so I am going to D.C. now
to question him.
So Lockwood and Luthor
may be connected?
We think. But, uh...
That's actually not the reason
I came to talk to you.
We found a gun in Eve's lab.
The DEO matched the bullets
to the one you were shot with.
Manchester Black
didn't shoot you, James.
It was Eve.
So that means Lex is behind this, too.
Did you see?
The Alien Amnesty Act
was just repealed.
What?
...to repeal the Alien Amnesty Act.
I'm sure some of you are surprised,
- but I can assure you...
- Eve.
Did you see that?
That was Eve.
She's in D.C.
That was quick.
Your friends betray you already?
No, Mother.
I came to give you this.
The blueprints to the prison?
Lex was coming for you.
I hate to say I told you so.
Really?
'Cause I just love saying it.
Look at your cell, Mother.
Do you see your name, Mother?
Written in red, in Lex's handwriting.
We both know what that means.
No.
He wouldn't.
Lex was coming for you.
But not to free you.
To murder you.
The question is, Mother,
why would he bother
to come and kill you?
Unless you knew something.
Something that could be used
to find him?
So who are you gonna bet your life on?
The psychopath...
or me?
The only person who can
or will protect you.
You can tell me what you
know when you're ready.
I'm patient.
Lena.
Wait.
The senators are
making their way in now.
Until the President arrives,
we will only be doing photos.
No sign of Eve down here yet.
Maybe I'd better look up there.
Senator Granberry,
excuse me for a second.
Uh, what happened?
Why did you change your vote?
Just take the win.
Mr. Lockwood.
No questions, Mr. Olsen.
You're aware that Otis Graves helped
Lex Luthor escape, aren't you?
Otis Graves is deceased.
Actually, he's not.
I have nothing to do with Lex Luthor.
Sure about that?
Supergirl.
How on earth did you find me?
The only car protected
with an X-ray scatter field?
Oh, poo.
Out of the car.
Enjoy the show.
- My dad.
- Come on.
Let's go.
Take her out!
Oh, my God.
Let them hate
so long as they fear.
It was Supergirl.
My fellow Americans
by now you have surely heard
that the heart of our
great nation was attacked...
by someone many of you trusted
with your security
and your hopes.
Supergirl.
She attacked in retaliation
to the repeal
of the Alien Amnesty Act,
ignoring our democracy
in favor of her own
alien brute form of justice.
The American people
have welcomed these aliens,
they've repaid our hospitality
with violence.
But we are not weak, we are Americans.
We are humans.
I am hereby enacting
martial law for our protection.
And, Supergirl, if you are watching,
make no mistake,
this act of horrific terrorism
will not go unanswered.
You are now public enemy number one.
Mmm-mmm.
There's no way Supergirl would
do something like this.
I know.
I was wrong.
I need your help.
Think you can stick around?
I'm not going anywhere.
This is J'onn J'onzz,
private investigator.
Please leave a message and I'll
get back to you as soon as I can.
