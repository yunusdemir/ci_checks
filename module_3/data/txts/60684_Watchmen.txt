Let it be
that we maintain our strength for peace.
So let each opponent
of America to ask:
Weigh the disadvantages of an attack
outweigh the benefits?
As a result of the Soviet threat ...
sets the monitoring circuit of scholars
doemsdag the-clock on eleven fifty-five.
Destruction by nuclear war.
Question:
On a scale of one to ten
ten as an absolute guarantee ...
what is the probability that the Russians
the United States attacks?
Pat Buchanon.
-Zero.
The Soviets no war risk
until we have our nuclear deterrent.
You mean of course Dr. Manhattan.
But guarantees its existence
world peace? Eleanor Clift.
It has not stopped the Russians
nuclear weapons to collect.
Do you not think that is megalomania?
Maybe they tested these weapons because they
feel threatened by Dr. Manhattan.
Perhaps experience
the whole world that so.

This is reinforced glass.

Fixed-through discarded.
Have you viewed the bedroom?
Everything overturned met.
Probably a robbery.

Diary of Rorschach,
October 12, 1985.
Dead dog rose today.
Tire tracks in the open burst abdomen.
This city is afraid of me.
I see its true face.
The streets are extended
of the gutter, filled with blood.
And if the drain becomes clogged,
drown them all.
The accumulated dirt from their dirty deeds
will opschuimen their belly ...
and all the whores and politicians
will cry: 'Help us'.
And I'll whisper no.
The world is
on the edge of the abyss.
All these liberals, intellectuals
and gladjakkers ...
and suddenly no one knows
something more to say.
Screaming down the city
as a slaughterhouse full backward children ...
And the night is redolent sex
and bad too.
Tonight is a comedian died in New York,
and someone knows why.
It all started with the gangs.
We forget that sometimes.
Pirate Costumes, ghosts ...
She found it so funny to commit robberies.
After their arrest
as they were back outside.
No one could identify them by these masks ...
So some of us had the idea
us to change.
To determine what the police could not.
The newspapers got wind of
and suddenly we were popular entertainment.
It was me, Dollar Bill, Mothman,
Captain Metropolis, Hooded Justice ...
Silk Specter and Comedian.
Break me not open the mouth about him.
I am already drunk
I tell you this story.
I just wanted to say something.
I wanted to say
that we were too easy.
You are unfairly treated.
You start where we stopped.
With Nixon you worked out.
That bastard.
Five times that I have voted for him.
-It was him or the Communists.
Nearly midnight already
I gotta go.
Frankly ...
are you a better Nite Owl
than I ever have been.
We both know that is nonsense.
-Watch your language.
This left corner
Captain Axis has gevloerd.
Next week?
-You do me no pleasure to do.
If you even have a date or something ...
We have retired
support each other, right?
Do you miss ever?
No. You?
Of course not.
-I see you later.
Hello, Daniel.
-Rorschach.
I've caught some beans.
Hopefully you do not find much.
Of course not.
I will not warm up?
It is also good.
What about you?
Not in the prison,
in any case.
Look at this.
Beans Sauce?
Human-bean sauce.
That button was the Comedian.
The blood also.
He is dead.
Let's go down to talk.
Maybe it was a burglary
Comedian and he knew not.
A simple burglar who kills the Comedian.
Ridiculous.
He worked since 1977 for the government.
Marxist Republics
tip of South America.
Maybe it was
a political statement.
Maybe. Whether someone is
costumed heroes to murder.
Is that not what paranoid?
-Call me today so?
The Comedian has made many enemies,
even among his friends.
How does the fact
with Hollis Mason?
He had written that book
which he bad things about the Comedian said.
The zint me what you mean.
And do not you follow me.
Maybe I look at you
could anyone have foreseen the heroes.
You were never sentimental.
-About one of our attacks on us all.
What do you
that we have to do?
Retribution.
The Watchmen are not there anymore.
Tricky Dick said, yes.
-I say this.
Nobody knows you. You can stop
and a normal life.
Do you have a normal life?
If you are sick city,
along the bastards with their heroin and child pornography ...
you feel normal?
I hide me at least
not behind a mask.
No.
You blocked you in public.
I still talk to you, Dan.
You can later from
by a maintenance liege.
I know I have.
I came here often.
When we were still partners.
-Those were beautiful times, right?
What happened?
-You stopped.
Mr. Veidt ...
to date, you are only a
Watchmen of the two who have their identity revealed.
The first was Hollis Mason.
You has taken full advantage.
Your alter ego, Ozymandias,
transformed to one billion industry.
Toys, lunch kits,
genetic manipulation ...
There might even be a movie.
-I have heard no demand.
Excuse me.
do u. ..
which others despise me
because I buy over their work?
It is in me come
that some of them think that maybe.
Just as you know
that color sells better news.
Our trade finance were
the work of Dr. Manhattan.
Our research station
Antarctica has been extended ...
in the hope of sustainable energy
develop ...
the use of
fossil fuel reduction.
One can see that the cold war
with Russia stems from fear.
Fear not enough to have.
But with infinite resources ...
war is unnecessary.
I hope the Watchmen understand,
wherever they may be.
Thanks for your time.
You look good, Adrian.
-It is too long ago.
So does anyone Rorschach
on the Watchmen has targeted.
Could it be?
A murder does not say.
Rorschach is a sociopaat, just as the Comedian.
It was almost a Nazi.
I know you like no other.
-I am here not because I miss him.
Rorschach know that we alone
who know each other's identity.
The whole world knows you.
Therefore I warn you first.
Thank you, Dan.
But we need something tangible fear suppose
than Rorschach killer.
If the Russians deploy nuclear weapons,
Jon can they stop?
They have a stock
of 51,000 nuclear weapons.
Even if he was at 99%
would that all life on Earth delete.
Even Dr. Manhattan can not
everywhere at the same time.
<i> Rockefeller military research </ i>
Diary of Rorschach,
October 13, 1985.
Half nine evening.
The meeting with Berg Drei
had a bitter aftertaste.
The grade has been loser
hides in his basement.
Why are so few of us
still active and healthy ...
and without mental disorders?
The first Nite Owl
has a garage.
The first is an old Silk Specter
whore who wears her days in a rest home.
Dollar Bill was with his cape stuck
and was shot.
Silhouette is murdered.
A victim of its own lifestyle.
Mothman is a founded in Maine.
There are only two.
Both share their residence
in the Rockefeller Research Institute.
I will be approaching.
I will indestructible man say
that someone wants him dead.
Good evening, Rorschach.
-Dr. Manhattan.
You know where I come?
-Yes.
But you will leave disappointed.
You can not come.
You should be sought.
Also nice to see you, Silk Specter.
-I have been my real name.
What you want, Laurie
-What are you doing here?
The Comedian is dead.
Rorschach wants me in the future look ...
to see if the offender is known.
I have already warned Berg Drei.
Now I warn you.
All I wanted to help my vision for the future
is disturbed by a temporary disruption.
I can not see.
-Disordered by what?
Most likely, a nuclear holocaust.
If the U.S. and Russia open war ...
the resulting shock
Tachyon produce as much as ...
particles returned by
what you experienced as a time travel ...
I have no sight
to the present. I must go.
Wait. What if someone us
from the road would overcome?
So we can not stop?
Day, Rorschach.
It took a lot of trouble here.
I go t ...
I say before I did.
You verzwijgt much for me.
-I wanted you not to worry.
When Adrian and I solve the energy crisis,
perhaps we can prevent war.
In your time is proportionate.
How can you change the future?
Could you see the time but as I do.
Let me show you.
Magic, dreams, that is what I originally had.
I was a hero.
I can not help you old.
I care for you and your child.
Go Eddie,
maybe you have the better with him.
This was a single mistake.
-He 's trying to rape ...
You verzandt bad thoughts,
and then you wonder why I hold things.
Then say goodbye to me.
You want me to eat questions.
As before.
But you know that can not.
So call you Dan.
It is only logical.
You deserve the comfort
of an old friend.
Table of Dan Berg Drei.
Remember that you still crazy?
Captain Carnage.
Pretended he was a superschurk
to be beaten up.
Has he ever done to me.
I just walked away.
He comes after me in broad daylight
and calls' bestraf me.
I say no,
drat.
What's become of him?
He did well Rorschach,
and threw him in an elevator shaft.
That is not even funny.
Although a bit.
It is nice to see you.
-You too.
Why did we?
Our dress?
Because nobody else did.
-But do you remember my costume yet?
All that tight latex? Terrible.
-Yes, terrible.
I wanted to mother not disappoint.
They wanted that I would be just like her.
I think the Keene Act
God was a gift.
We live at least be longer.
Jon thinks that unless he takes something,
a nuclear war breaks out.
Soon.
I know not. For him, everything
to quantum mechanics and parallel realities.
I often do not know what universe he sees.
He is moving further away from me.
From everyone.
I do not even know if he still
about me or just pretend.
If he pretends
it means that he gives you.
I open the door so.
Got it?
Excuse me. I had invited you
nice to talk to ...
but there is fun
no more.
What are you?
The Comedian is dead.
Laurie?
Is that you?
I thought you now
was so accustomed to travel.
Not so. I hate
Jon teleport me as well.
Always better than flying.
Margarita?
It is two o'clock in the afternoon.
Remember that guy
who send me letters?
He has me
a collector's item sent.
An adult book of the year'40.
Has he sent you?
-They are very valuable.
This is disgusting.
-I found it flattering.
Why do you call me mother always
if you are angry?
I know you will.
I can still read.
I read the newspaper.
Eddy Blake's funeral is today.
Now I finally get the punch line.
Poor Eddy.
-After you what he did?
You are still young.
You know it.
Things change.
The past is behind us.
I am 67 years old.
Each day, the darker future ...
but the past
even the bad bits ...
only better.
Thank you.
Morning for three hours in my studio.
A real photo.
How would my hair look?
Go ahead. I do so.
What are you doing here?
You knew that I am doing.
Sure.
I know what you want, and there is solid
a reason why you are so dressed.
I said no, Eddy.
Spelled as' yes'.
-Spelled as' no '.
Come on, sweetie.
Little bastard.
Do you like this?
Windt you notice?
We should all believe.
Both the righteous
as the bad.
The Comedian
was a bit of both.
He always thought that he
would be the last laugh.
Fireworks?
Do not believe it.
That they are still not enough
have seen fireworks.
If we had lost,
we were crazy.
If country.
But that did not happen.
Thanks you.
You sound bitter.
Me, bitter?
Of course not. I find it hilarious.
Mr. Eddy?
-Exactly what I needed.
The war is over.
We need to talk.
On this child.
-There is nothing to discuss.
I am leaving, and then I forget
you dirty rotlandje.
Drat.
Drat.
-You will remember me and my country.
Forever.
My face.
She was pregnant.
And you have her shot.
That's right.
And you looked at again.
You had the gun in steam can change
bullets in mercury, the bottle snow snowflakes ...
But you did not.
You give nothing to people.
You got further and further away, doc.
God help us.
Medic.

Welcome to the first meeting.
-What a nonsense.
For someone who calls himself the Comedian
I never know when you're serious.
The Watchmen are a joke.
It worked 15 years ago ...
and just as you now
india Antje to play are.
Maybe we should not drink
during meetings.
Rorschach and I are one piece
made by our cooperation ...
Such a large group smacks
a publicity stunt.
I do not for the fame.
We can do so much more.
We can save this world.
With the right leadership.
And that is you, right?
The smartest man in the world.
You do not have to be genius
to the problem.
But a room full of idiots can understand
that you are over your pet.
People are trying
all times to eradicate.
Now we have finally
the resources.
If the nuclear bombs in the air to
we still on.
Then Ozymandias
the smartest man in the ashoop.
We do not need you.
Give us back our police.
Attention, citizens.
We try to keep order.
Clear the street
the police strike is over.
There is no reason for violence.
If you play it?
There is no reason for violence.
This is out of hand.
Great for
American ground works.
I have since Woodward and Bernstein
no longer had as much fun.
How long can we sustain this?
The Congress would prohibit costumed heroes.
Our days are numbered.
Until that time we
the only protection of society.
Against what?
-Hold me for a ride? Against itself.
Bastard.
-Wait.
Stay away from me.
-What's become of us?
Whats up
of the American dream now?
That is out.
You look at it.
<i> behind you </ i>
Edgar William Jacobi,
also known as Edgar William Vaughn ...
Also known as Moloch.
What are you talking about?
I am a retired businessman.
Lie again
and I break a finger.
I am no longer Moloch.
What do you want from me?
I heard that you
Blakes funeral was. Why?
I found my honor
had expressed to the Comedian.
How did you know he was?
-He has been broken.
Past week. Without mask.
He was drunk.
Decades enemies.
Why is he to you?
When I awoke, he was there.
He was upset.
He cried.
-The Comedian?
He raaskalde.
I could make nothing of.
I did it in my pants.
I thought he was killing me.
What did he say?
It is a joke.
It is all a joke.
I thought I knew.
How the world together Saturday

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:47,754
I've done bad things.
Against women, children ... in Vietnam.
But that was war.
Something like this I have never done.
I'm here my heart
to pay with my arch enemy.
You will have the closest
of a friend. What that says about me?
Your name was on the list,
with Janey, or how they are hot.
Manhattan old girlfriend.
Mother, forgive me.
When he was gone.
I do not know what he was saying.
Strange story.
Sounds unbelievable.
Will be true.
It clearly is?
I am not a suspect?
Not suspicious?
Amygdaline, medicine based
of abrikozenpitten. Illegal.
Please.
Please do not confiscated.
I grab everything.
I have cancer.
What kind of cancer?
You know that type
you heal?
Not that.
Diary of Rorschach,
October 16.
Considered Moloch story.
It can be a big lie.
A revenge attempt
planned from prison.
Fuck you. I deserve more
in one week than you in a Monday
But if so, what beangstigt him
so that he uithuilt to Moloch?
What has he seen?
And that list where he
it had ...
Edward Blake, the Comedian ...
Born in 1918.
Buried in the rain.
Murdered.
Is that our fate?
No time for friends?
Only our enemies
which rose to leave?
Violent Living
that violent end.
Blake understood that people
cruel by nature.
However much you want to hide.
Blake saw the true face
of society.
He was a parody.
A joke.
I once heard a joke.
A man at the doctor,
complain of depression.
Life is hard and cruel about it.
He feels only
in a threatening world.
The treatment is simple.
The clown Pagliacci is in town.
Go see him.
That turn you on.
The man burst into tears.
But doctor,
I am Pagliacci.
Good joke. Everyone laughs.
Drum roll at the end.
You must prepare
for your interview.
No worries.
We have time Saturday
Like a battery licks.
Stop. What are you doing?
-Do not be angry.
I thought you loved it.
No.
I love ...
I will not.
-I do not know what you feel.
I know you try ...
Work through your
while we are in bed?
My work is in a critical phase.
I did not need to ...
to tell
who screwed me out of pity?
My attention was entirely to you.
I am ready to talk
any problems with my behavior.
You know how all this way,
except people.
What am I to you?
A puzzle must be solved?
Tell your men to go backwards.
I teleport the reactor to Karnak.
You are my last link to the world.
I want that responsibility anymore.
You can have him.
They will come back.
-It does not.
He has many names:
Held, weapon crux of our security ...
deterrent against nuclear war,
world destroyer.
Tonight is Dr. Manhattan
response to our questions ...
advertising in a Friday interview,
made possible by Veidt.
Who is it?
-Laurie.
I got a new lock put out.
-I did not know where to go.
No problem.
Come inside.
What is it?
-I am with Jon road.
Excuse me.
-I do not know why I'm here. I ...
I know no one else.
I know no one else
Damn than superheroes.
It is all right.
It was just a disagreement.
You do not know how it is.
The way he looks at things ...
as if he no longer
know what they are.
This world is for him
as if he is missing.
People are only shadows.
Shadows in the mist.
How is everything in the war affected?
Excuse me.
I have twice your evening ruined.
Come, I'm glad you're here.
I was just leaving for Hollis
for our weekly beer.
You can reassure them.
I am even.
Beautiful. Dr. Manhattan is there and I know nothing.
-He is just there.
No time for makeup.
That blue is too bright for TV.
Is this dark enough?
Dark enough, yes.
Seymour.
-Bernie. How are you?
Here is a list
approved topics.
Afghanistan will be discussed ...
but stay calm and try
not for the barrier to be put.
A scientist who through an accident
special forces verworf.
To be able to subject his will to form.
Today we know him
as Dr. Manhattan. Welcome.
Thank you
Ms. Black,
to the first question.
As you know, symbolizing the doemsdag clock
the end of humanity.
Midnight
stands for nuclear war.
He is now four to twelve.
Are we so close to the abyss?
My father was a watchmaker.
He stopped them when Einstein discovered
that time is relative.
A symbolic clock
is just as useful for thinking ...
as a picture of oxygen
for someone who is drowning.
So there is no danger?
-Even in a world without nuclear weapons is a danger.
Do you agree with what many say
you are God ...
given the past
and the future at a time like?
I see only
my own past and future.
I am not Seer.
About your past ...
Do you know a man named Wally Weaver?
We were both researchers
the Gila Flats basis.
He died of cancer.
-He was a good man.
And Edgar Jacobi? Also known as Moloch.
You have fought against him in the sixties.
Did you know that he has cancer?
-That I do not tell.
And Anthony Randall,
your number when you began with the government.
Cancer.
-You mean that I am the cause.
It begins to appear.
-It would be irrelevant.
A living and dead man
have the same number of particles.
There is no structural difference.
Calm down.
And Janey Slater?
Is it for her?
Your ex-girlfriend, also a physicist.
You were eleven years with each other.
One question at a time.
-It also has cancer.
She has another six months.
However, Mrs Slater?
You were everything to me, Jon.
You were my life.
How many times have you said you loved me?
-I knew nothing.
I stayed after the accident.
I gave everything.
Is this my gratitude?
-Janey, I knew nothing.
Damn, Jon.
Damn.
Janey, wait.
The interview is over.
Get that camera away.
Reverse.
I need some help.
Please ...
If everyone is leaving ...
and left me alone.
Leave me alone.
I look at the stars.
They are so far away.
It takes as long as
before their light reaches us.
All we ever see stars
his old photos.
July, 1959.
I'm in love.
You can retrieve it tomorrow.
75 Cent.
Had something said. I am sure love it.
-You are absolutely beautiful on.
Her name is Janey Slater.
She is also a physicist.
I am 30 years old.
We know each other
by a friend, Wally Weaver.
February 12, 1981.
Walley died of cancer.
Which it now claims
I am the cause.
That night we companies
the first love.
One month later
accident happens.
I do so.
I forgot my watch.
Let us wait.
I walk to the intrinsic field space
and find my watch.
If I use the door closer
Wally looks pale.
The program has been put.
We can not change the time slot.
I am terrified.
Excuse me.
I can not ...
Leave me alone.
It is May 12, 1959
Janey and I are proposed.
She gives me a beer.
For the first time that a woman for me.
If she shows me the cold glass
get our fingers together.
Well done, Jon. Now you have the components
in the correct order to restore.
I feel fear.
For the last.
A symbolic funeral held.
There is nothing to bury.
Janey list photo.
It is the only photo of me.
A vatenstelsel
is seen at the gate.
A few days later, there
half formed skeleton in the hallway.
It just screams
before it disappears.
Oh, god.
Jon?
Is that you?
The world is still
struck by this news ...
perhaps the most important
incident so far.
The Superman exists,
and it is an American.
They call me Dr. Manhattan.
A name that fear must call
by the enemies of America.
They changed me into something tawdry.
Something dead things.
In January 1971 President Nixon asked me
to intervene in the Vietnam War.
Something that his predecessors
would not ask.
A week later
the conflict is over.
Some want to Vietcong
personally to me vomiting.
Hollis Mason, a retired
hero, writes a book.
This he called my arrival
the beginning of the superhero.
I'm not sure
what that means.
I was wrongly quoted. I did not
that superman exists and American.
I said that God exists,
and an American.
If you are now on the spiritual level
begins to make sure ...
Do not worry.
It means that you still have your mind.
Christmas, 1963.
Janey says she is scared and worried.
She sees me as a god.
I say that that does not exist.
And if he was
times I do not like him.
I say that I still love her,
and always will.
I lie. On September 4, 1970 I
in a room full of people dressed.
A young girl looks at me and laughs.
She is beautiful.
Each long kiss they answered
with a gentle, tender kiss on my lips.
There is something characteristic ends.
Janey says that I find
young girls run.
She burst into tears
and asked whether it is her age.
That is true.
It is the day older ...
while I stilsta.
I prefer the silence here.
I am the Earth, and these people sick.
I'm tired
in their lies to get entangled.
They say
the sky to build.
But their sky
is full of horrors.
Maybe the world is not made.
Perhaps nothing is made.
A clock without a watchmaker.
It's too late.
It is and will always be late.
The Soviets have tanks
moved to the Afghan border.
They see if we disappearance
Dr. Manhattan have invented ...
them from the tent to attract.
How fast can we
establish a pre-emptive strike?
Two days.
There is 54% chance that we Russia
can destroy before they can fire.
If the number of nuclear weapons that we
all destroyed in observance ...
we lose
the entire east coast.
The last gasp
Harvard.
Let them think again
on nuclear fission.
The wind will
radioactive fallout go south.
Mexico gets the worst.
Agriculture remains largely unscathed.
Not so bad,
if you are watching.
What do you do
Mr. President?
Go over to DEFCON 2.
Bring the bombers in readiness.
Dr. Manhattan has two days.
Then ...
our fate is in higher hands.
Let us hope
he on our side.
Without Dr. Manhattan
Russians to the peace forces ...
will be on old-fashioned
energy must be confident.
You understand yet that the old energy
can not just give up.
That would be manslaughter
for our economy.
They want free energy,
in other words socialism.
Maybe we should agree check
any Communist ties.
Gentlemen, I respect your role and what you
together have achieved within the industry.
Would you know my past?
Okay.
As you know my parents died
when I was 17. I remained alone.
I've always been alone.
They call me the smartest man in the world,
but I often feel the dumbest.
I feel connected with anyone.
Non-living persons,
in any case.
The one I most connected
felt died 300 years before Christ.
Alexander of Macedonia,
better known as Alexander the Great.
His world view was unique.
I wanted to match his deeds,
and decided in antiquity to the present.
She began conquer my ring trip.
Not on people,
but at their expense.
Fossil fuels, nuclear fission ...
they are a drug,
and your dealers.
Listen ...
-No.
But you listen.
The world goes on, and he deserves more
than your offer.
Let us to business.
I am worth more than you together.
I can buy all your business.
Remember that if you this
disagreement in the public want.
You know the output.
Gentlemen.
The department wants to talk toys
new villains for Ozymandias.
All the old rogue is dead.
I do have a few ideas.
I think we are wrong
started.
A zelfmoordpil.
Not much bite, bastard.
Who sent you?
Give me a name.
A zelfmoordpil.
-Cyanide. Dead before he hit the ground.
Rorschach was right.
-This is not just a fool.
It is an organization.
Well funded and equipped.
Who wants to kill us now?
-No idea.
But it is not safe.
Jon heard anything yet?
Listen, why do not you stay
some time with me?
That is sweet,
but I do not want to intrude.
You would me
A pleasure to do.
Then I do not worry
about you.
Diary of Rorschach,
October 21, 1985.
I saw Drei Berg and Jupiter
come from a restaurant.
They know me not
without mask.
I wonder ...
She Manhattan heart to him
way to hunt because of Berg Drei?
Manhattan has a heart
to break?
Veidts killer was a Sammy
Roy called Chess.
I have found evidence
in his apartment.
He worked for Pyramid Transnational.
I have the logo already
seen by Moloch.
Someone tried today
the smartest man in the world to explain.
Worked for Pyramid Transnational.
More than one delivery, I suppose?
I saw here last time
a pension check from the same company.
Probably a cover
the guy who wants us dead.
No more lies, Moloch.
Who runs Pyramid?
Rorschach, this is the police.
We know you are there.
If you have someone,
let him go unharmed.
Make yourself easy.
-Stupid, stupid, stupid.
Never give up.
-Hope you're ready, hero.
You too.
Get him.
-Come on.
He stinks.
-Put it that mask.
Give me my face back.
<i> Rorschach is arrested
and identified as Walter Kovacs ...</ i>
<i> a 35-year-old white man. </ i>
<i> There is not much known about him,
but he is suspected of the murder of Edgar Jacobi ...</ i>
<i> that his head shot
in his own home. </ i>
I go as hard tackle
as your mother.
Walter Kovacs.
Is that your name?
Let me explain your situation.
If you cooperate I can convince
you should be treated in a hospital.
That would do you good.
They want you to rest up.
Prison is prison.
The difference is
they tear you.
Many of them
sit here by you.
What you see here?
A beautiful butterfly.
And this?
Mama?
Does it pain you?
What's your kid here?
I have at home.
Had I but
abortion to consult.
Beautiful flowers.
His mother is a whore.
Even diseases occurred?
Young whore.
Listen, moron.
Would she pipes for a dollar?
Clouds.
Tell me about
Rorschach, Walter.
You always called me Walter.
I can not.
Why do you think?
-You are thick ...
rich, liberal beliefs.
Rorschach wil you know?
I will tell you about him.
I investigated a kidnapping.
Blair Roche
a girl of six.
I was still young,
and soft on criminals.
I let them live.
Someone's arm for an appointment.
It led me to the girl.
I knew she was
but I could not find.
And when I found her.
It was dark
when the killer came back.
As dark as possible.
Jesus.
Who's there?
Who's there?
Who are you?
What do you think of me?
You killed my dogs.
You think I just
her to do?
I have found.
This is not evidence.
Okay, I confess.
I have her kidnapped and murdered.
Arrest me.
Arrest me.
I confess it.
I need help.
Arrest me.
Do not.
Arrest me.
Do not.
Men are arrested.
Dogs killed.
The vibrations
my left arm shaking.
Warm blood
splattered on my face.
What about Walter Kovacs was
died together with that girl.
From then there was only Rorschach.
God has not slain.
The fate has not fed the dogs.
If God has looked on
seemed to him nothing to make.
I know now
that God the world is not so.
That is what we do.
You are quite famous.
You know, I am famous.
Or not?
Do you want a signature
tough guy?
You understand it.
I'm not up to you.
You sit up with me.
I normally do.
Excuse me. I've found
on the wrong button.
I'm fine.
Excuse me.
No problem. The Comedian was also in 1977.
Archie also survived.
Abbreviation of Archimedes,
the owl of Merlin.
Stupid name.
How can you afford?
My father was in the banking
and gave me a lot of survivors.
That surprised me.
He was disappointed
I did not succeeded.
I was more interested in birds,
aircraft and mythology.
It must be nice
have a secret identity.
A secret hideout
that nobody knows.
A place where no one harasses you,
or meekijkt.
Wil you set up once?
So.
Great.
He reinforced the light spectrum.
Heat Vision.
It works even better in the dark.
Can you see me?
I see everything.
How dark everything seemed ...
I looked through those glasses,
everything was clear.
For example, Jon the world.
I go back upstairs.
The food is cold.
Put it back
when you are done.
The Soviets are forced <i>
from house to house fighting. </ i>
<i> The death toll runs in the hundreds. </ i>
<i> There are many civilian casualties. </ i>
Jon sees a lot ...
but me
he is not.
If you just ...
If yes.
What is it?
I have even
an appropriate moment.
Damn.
Long ago, Rorschach.
Big man
small world.
That is good.
But this is really
a small world.
And how long am I now?
-Almost 15 years, Mr. Figure.
15 years since you and the owl
here have put me down.
The guy you've burned
is dying.
If I am not mistaken are here
fifty man thanks you.
I have them all talk.
They eat you raw.
This tent goes pop.
Soon you
a cup smaller.
Great Speech.
I make him.
Easy, Lawrence.
Soon.
Everything okay?
I'm tired
to be afraid.
Afraid of war,
for the killer that we should have.
And this damn package ...
and how I want.
-Me too.
What do we care?
Let's go out.
Really.
-I was also a masked hero.
I am accustomed to late night
something crazy to get out.
<i> Central to all units
burning building. </ i>
Come on.
I see it.
-Hang on.
There are children inside.
Stay where you are and stay calm.
We get you there.
The roof collapsed.
Put me.
I bring you closer.
Come on.
Have we all?
That we have done.
They connect us to Rorschach.
What would it?
The third world war can dawn tomorrow.
Right?
He is dead. We are a gift
bring everyone now derived.
Something from the workshop.
Noticed that he no longer such a large
mouth now he knows what awaits him?
Dikdoenerij.
You go out. We have
a prison full of murderers. What do you think?
Your hands.
Your welcome.
I can not at the castle.
I saw through the bars?
This means so rel.
I have been waiting 15 years.
Sorry Lawrence,
but you, my revenge in the way.
Not personal,
big boy.
Now we
the state look.
A - zero for me.
Come get me.
I agree are thinking.
I think we have a duty
to have our brotherhood.
We must liberate Rorschach.
Someone has him in it up.
And that thing with Jon
and cancer is not.
You have not.
In a prison break
is something other than fire extinguishing.
You're right.
It is fun.
Come on.
I want to smell him as he cooks.
Never washed down with a dirty toilet.
Best sense.
Two - zero.
Your turn.
On the side.
Where is my face?
Am not dead.
Your turn.
What you see here?
Freeze.
Excuse me.
I have to go to the toilet.
Frankly true.
Everything okay?
It's a bit much.
War, an escape from prison ...
Do not worry.
Everything is good.
Hi, Laurie.
On TV they said you were on Mars.
-I am.
We will call there.
-What are you talking about?
You are trying to convince me
the world to save.
Do not.
-Trust me. I have to do this.
Wonderful, is not it?
Forgive me.
I forget these things sometimes.
It will not happen again.
What a relief.
I'm on Mars.
We must interrogate underworld figures.
We can open a phone book.
-Have you forgotten how it was previously?
You are weak and naive become
especially against women.
Now I have enough of.
Who do you think you are?
You abuse people
and nobody complains because they love you find.
Excuse me.
That I should not say.
You're a good friend.
I know I
sometimes you have to suffer.
Forget it.
It is all right.
We do it your way.
Pyramid Transnational.
Is anyone familiar?
Bastards. I give everyone
a button and this is my thanks.
Reverse or you get
this glass in your face.
Stay calm
we try to solve it quickly.
Roy Chess paid by Pyramid,
Adrian Veidt tried to kill.
Death.
Did you know him?
I got him hired.
I knew him.
You're a criminal.
-That was me. I am now on the right path.
I gave her barely touched.
I had to hire him.
From whom?
-My contact Ms. Slater.
Works also for Pyramid?
-Nice woman.
They hire ex-offenders
them half chance.
Let me go.
I speak the truth.
Janey Slater.
Manhattan old girlfriend.
We can, through Adrian
find out who is funding Pyramid.
We follow the money.
This is where our
conversation will take place.
What you ask me
nuclear war against them.
But why should I save a world
I have no stake in?
For me.
If you really cares about me.
When you left me,
I left the Earth.
Proves that not that I care for you?
My red world here ...
means more to me
than your blue.
Let me show you.
The bombers are ready, sir.
The time has come, gentlemen.
Go over to DEFCON 1.
Not in his penthouse,
not in his office.
What night life attract a man
who has yet to let out?
We can see his travel schedule.
-Perhaps in his archive.
Something is not there.
-I agree.
Janey Slater, Moloch, Roy Chess,
they all work for Pyramid.
Moloch said the Comedian
the list of names mentioned.
The owner of Pyramid
finds the cancer cases are.
And Manhattan
geluisd have it.
Funny. The pharaohs looked from
towards the end of the world.
They thought that the dead would resurrect
their hearts retrieval.
They will be
hills await.
A psychological
report of Dr. Manhattan.
Let's see what the psychologists
have to say.
Individual is always afstandiger.
If the last links removal
we predict full withdrawal humanity.
I'm in it.
Congratulations, Mr.. Veidt.
The reactor of Dr. Manhattan is ready.
Your support and enthusiasm
have brought us this victory.
The research
brings a toast to you.
What is not
to be celebrated?
This is the new Karnak.
The final
of two thousand years old dream ...
now reach
thanks to your selfless support.
And I am ashamed ...
you now
about inadequate pay deserve.
On the Pharaohs.
Their biggest secrets
assigned to their employees ...
buried alive with them
in sandy leave.
Soft rust, gentlemen.
Our new, peaceful world
thank you for your sacrifice.
Bubastis.
Veidt is behind everything.
What does it achieve?
I can not imagine a more dangerous
opposing proposals.
He is quick enough to catch a ball.
He may kill us both.
We now fly to Antarctica.
I hope the world survives
and this diary someone gets.
I live without compromises.
Without complaining or concerns them.
Rorschach,
November 1.
Can not you just say
how this ends and save us the nonsense?
It ends with you in tears.
Tears?
So you come back no more?
I'll be back.
Ever.
The streets are littered with similar.
-You must prevent this.
Humanity will be destroyed.
And the universe
will not even notice.
In my view, the existence of life
highly overvalued.
Look around you.
Mars saves fine
without even a micro-organism.
The landscape is changing.
It takes new forms ...
in waves
of tens of thousands of years.
How would this improved
with a shopping mall?
Is a wonder so much to ask?
Miracles have
By definition, no meaning.
Only what can happen, happens.
-Stop with that nonsense.
Put this thing to the ground.
-As you wish.
Send me back to Earth
to bake with all those useless people.
But you were wrong. This would end
in tears, and that did not happen.
Maybe you have everything wrong.
You say that I live
not see what it is.
But you refuse to
my part to see.
You close off your fears.
I am not afraid.
Wil your show?
Do what you normally do.
Magic, dreams, that is what I originally had.
I was a hero.
I can not help you old.
I care for you and your child.
Go Eddie,
maybe you have the better with him.
Even the bad bits
only better.
The daughter of Sally Jupiter.
Comedian-You are, right?
You did well.
Your mother
was a wonderful girl.
You have her eyes. You ...
-Stay away from her.
Long time no see.
-Not long enough, Eddy.
Boarding. Now.
Can you still sinking deeper?
-Can I not even talk to my ...
The daughter
of an old girlfriend?
Ride.
This was a single mistake.
-He 's trying to rape ...
and then leave you again?
Were you drunk or just lonely?
Is this me
forever chasing?
The Comedian was your father.
My life is one big joke.
I do not.
Sorry if I feel you
not confident of humor.
Will you laugh
I admit that I was wrong?
About what?
Miracles.
Events which are almost
impossible ...
such as oxygen
changes in gold.
I wish it something to see
but it missed me ...
that in human reproduction
millions of cells compete to create life.
Generation to generation,
ultimately to your mother ...
a man loves. Edward Blake,
they all hate reason.
And from this incredible
Contrary come to you.
Only you ...
For such a specific
to take ...
from all the chaos ...
Like air
gold change.
A miracle.
So I had wrong.
Dry your tears.
we go home.
We have a poll on that building.
The heat sensor turn on.
That's just not shaken.
The engines.
-They freeze. Hang on.
You fly too low.
I would not interfere ...
but you should pull.
-That I'm trying, damn it.
I put the heat to the flame thrower
to freeze to go against ...
but it will take a while.
We can not wait.
You need warmer clothes.
-It is so good.
What is it, girl?
Adrian is a pacifist.
He is even a vegetarian.
He has never slain.
-Hitler was a vegetarian.
Leave him to me.
We get no second chance.
Gentlemen.
Welcome.
We know everything.
-What is there to be discussed?
Enough.
You have the Comedian slain.
May he rest in peace.
Blake got it first.
Nixon did it to us to monitor
to see if we were quiet.
Blake discovered my plans
and when his heart he was already airing far gone.
Even I could not predict
that it would capsize.
I had him dead. When I had
Jon is still off. No easy task.
The tachion research for his future vision
block cost nearly two billion.
You are psychological profile
used to manipulate him.
I know him long enough to see
that he still has feelings.
One would have seemed
facial features do not recognize ...
but in my eyes
he seemed to be screaming.
I had to do but
the strings to pull.
The emotions that came Friday when he thought
his loved ones with cancer to have infected ...
were enough reason
to leave.
You have to nepmoordenaar hired
to mislead us.
Chess was his life
for a higher purpose.
I stopped a zelfmoordpil
in his mouth.
There was only
a loose end.
You with your theory
the heroic killer.
You bite your fixed
as a real sociopaat.
I mentioned the police and during
I caught your name could go.
Sorry to disappoint you.
We would improve the world.
-I do.
Nuclear war?
Eradication of the human race?
Of course I
the necessary sacrifices considered.
Some key areas such as New York,
los Angeles, Moscow, Hong Kong ...
destroyed in an instant.
15 million deaths
by Dr. Manhattan.
The punishment for flirting
with the third world war.
Jon That would never do.
-Something that others never have come to know.
The breakthrough in my research
has just occurred.
Jon helped me all these years
its power to imitate ...
unaware
what I would do it.
The Comedian was right.
The cruel nature of man
eventually leads to world destruction.
To save the planet
I had him fooled.
The biggest joke
in the history of mankind.
Millions of deaths ...
-In order to save billions.
A necessary evil.
-We can not let you do.
Do?
I am not a cartoon.
Did you think I would reveal my plan
if there is something you could do?
I am 35 minutes
ago put in motion.
My god, Henry. Why do we
launch received no warning?
It is not the Soviets.
The information is
energy pattern similar to that of Dr. Manhattan.
Catastrophic disruption.
Do not believe it.
This is not nuclear weapons.
I was.
I did this.
What do you mean?
Not directly.
It was like my fault.
If you have the devil.
You must stop him.
He has Blake and millions of others slain.
Keep it in here.
The Tachyon was a smart move ...
but even if I you can not perceive
I can do the walls in glass change.
I must really thank you.
I had almost forgotten how exciting
it was in limbo to be.
Forgive me, girl.
Huge asshole.
Bastard.
If she is injured ...
Grow up.
My new world is
such heroism not.
You naive hero is unnecessary.
What have you achieved it?
Preventing destruction of the world
was your only victory.
Hello, I am very disappointed, Adrian.
Myself back together
was the first thing I got the knee.
Osterman was not dead on.
Did you really
that I would kill?
I have over the surface
the sun up.
I have such quick, minor
events observed ...
it almost as impossible
could be considered.
But you are a man.
The smartest man in the world
is no greater threat to me ...
than the smartest
termite in the world.
What is that?
Another powerful weapon?
If you would
can call.
Millions of lives <i>
are abruptly terminated ...</ i>
<i> a misdemeanor
of none other than Dr. Manhattan. </ i>
<i> Since the attack, I constantly
contact with the Russian premier. </ i>
<i> Despite our differences we will
work together against this common enemy. </ i>
<i> With help from the rest of the world
we will prevail. </ i>
<i> This day we will never forget. </ i>
Yet we <i> forward for humanity
and its values. </ i>
<i> Thank you
God bless us. </ I>
See?
The major draw back.
I have the world of hell right.
We both.
This is also your victory.
Now we can again
with what we originally were going to do.
We should enforce justice.
Everyone will know
what you did.
Then you would the peace which
many died in the game continue.
Peace by lies.
-Yet peace.
He is right.
He would reveal the world
immersion in nuclear war.
This we can not make.
-On Mars ...
showed me the value
view of life.
If we want to protect life,
should we remain silent.
Keep your secrets but itself.
Think there are not.
Wait.
Never give up.
Even with the decline in the prospect.
That is always the difference
between us two.
I felt each death.
Each innocent face
that is sacrificed for humanity.
You understand it right?
-Without the adoption ...
or to disapprove.
I understand.
On the side.
We need to know.
You know I
can not allow.
Discover now suddenly
your humanity?
This is situated.
If you already have that time had already meegeleefd
this was never done.
I can almost change everything ...
but not the kind of people.
Of course protect you
Veidts new utopia.
What does
another dead matter?
What are you waiting for?
Do it.
Do it.
I go to a less
complicated universe.
You gave it back to life?
-Do I.
Maybe I can create life.
Goodbye, Laurie.
Come on.
For a united world
there were sacrifices made.
You have not perfected humanity,
but maimed.
That is your legacy.
That is the real joke.
<i> I repeat:
There is nothing wrong with your device. </ I>
<i> You are at the point
a big adventure to begin. </ i>
<i> You will find soon
the awe and mystery ...</ i>
<i> that extends from the inner
to the extreme limit. </ i>
You really have nothing to drink?
No, thank you.
-Cheers.
I need something.
I know Eddy Blake
my father was.
What should you not
me thinking.
I am sorry that I did not say.
I had to do, but ...
I felt ashamed, and stupid ...
-It does not.
People leyden foreign food
and do strange things.
Sometimes they can not talk about.
I know how it feels.
I want you to know you
in my opinion have done nothing wrong.
You asked why I
not mad at him.
Because he gave me you.
Thank you, Mom.
I love you.
Day, Mrs Jupiter.
Say it, Sally.
I am worth.
Be back.
How are you doing here?
How goes it?
-Good. I have everything up and running.
All equipment Archie
has been upgraded.
The tinkering is done,
so we can out.
Sounds like a date.
Is it well with us?
As long as we think Jon
still watches over us, is ultimately all good.
Jon would say
that nothing ever ends.
Nothing ever ends.
Seymour, we have nothing more
To write.
Everyone is totally committed
with peace and togetherness.
As if we in a hippie-commune
ended up.
Reagan wants to be elected in 1988.
Since we could write.
We spend no time on nonsense.
This is still America.
Who wants just a cowboy
in the white house?
I would be in the
jokes archive may watch.
Show some initiative. Write what you want.
I leave it to you.
