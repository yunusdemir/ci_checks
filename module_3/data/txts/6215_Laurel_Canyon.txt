- You want me to stop?
- No, don't stop. Why'd you stop?
I don't know. You moved your leg.
You want me to keep going?
Yeah, keep going. Don't stop.
Like that. Yeah.
Okay. Don't move.
Don't stop.
Oh, God.
Oh, Lord. Oh, Jesus.
Fuck me. Fuck me.
I'll fuck you.
<i>Sam, hi, it's me. You don't need to
pick up. I know you're busy packing.</i>
<i>Just calling to say, "Yay!"</i>
<i>And listen, I'm kind of in a situation.</i>
- What?
- I finished.
- You did?
- Yeah.
That was really good.
What about you?
You know, I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.
Oh, my mother asked
about April again.
- Why is she so fixated on April?
- I'm sure it's economic.
I can't leave then.
I know. She's probably just trying
to get a deal on rentals.
- Beat the June rush or something.
- You wanna change the plan?
No, I don't. Do you?
No.
I don't know why people
get married in June anyway.
I mean, what's wrong with January?
I just never saw the reason to go out
there. It's disruptive, in my opinion.
Alex should be here
to finish her dissertation...
...and you should stay in Cambridge
if you'll be practicing here.
Well, I'd rather be in Cambridge,
absolutely...
...but the Hausman Institute
is the best program in the country.
I think you should reconsider
psychiatry, Sam.
It's a feeble discipline.
If you're interested in brains...
...get to the thick of it, the grey matter.
That's honest medicine.
Why waste yourself on the hopeless?
- So impressive, Alex.
- The M.D. alone is...
- It's a tremendous achievement.
- Then the Ph.D.?
- I haven't finished it yet.
- Genetics, my God.
- Genomics.
- Oh, right, of course. Genomics.
How long are you staying
with your mom?
- We're not.
- Oh, I thought you were.
No, no, we're staying at her house,
but she's not living there now.
- She's an executive, isn't she?
- Not exactly.
She's in the entertainment industry.
She's a record producer.
That's right.
Alex mentioned that once.
Well, it seems you have
everything under control.
Definitely. We've covered everything.
Think about my suggestion.
Oh, and take care of Alex, please.
We don't want her joining
the Scientologists...
...or the vegetarians.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
You can't leave now.
We haven't had the cake.
- Q.
- Beautiful.
Thank you.
Wow, you're behind by 40.
You have to focus.
- I am focusing.
- No, you're not. You're distracted.
No, I just don't read the dictionary,
smarty-pants.
Could I get another juice?
Can I get another Scotch, please?
You shouldn't worry about it anymore.
I didn't plan on worrying
about it at all.
- It's not that much time.
- Yeah, theoretically, yeah.
Oh, God. I wish I had a Xanax.
Well, what did she say, a week?
She wasn't specific.
Thanks.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I don't know why you didn't call
her earlier.
- Neither do I.
- I could've made other arrangements.
I know. I don't know why
I didn't call her back.
I should have.
Forty-seven.

- Whose cars?
- I don't know.
- She's really weird.
- I know. You've told me that before.
I just wanna re-emphasize.
Okay.
It's probably
a developmental disorder.
Sam.
Rarefied strain.
- Why are you telling me this again?
- I just don't want you to be surprised.
- It's temporary.
- I just don't want you getting upset.
Anyone's tolerable for a few weeks...
...even the developmentally disabled.
Come on. I need to pee.
Hey, hi.
What time is it? God, look at you.
- Oh, man, you look great.
- Thanks.
Really.
So do you.
Sorry. Alex, this is Jane, my mother.
Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too, finally.
- It's a pleasure.
- Thanks.
Likewise.
Hello. I'm Ian.
One of the crew.
Ian, Dean, Rowan, Fripp.
- Hi.
- Hi.
This is my son.
Sam.
- And...
- Oh, Alex.
Alex. God, I'm sorry.
It's lovely to meet you, Alex.
As well, you, Sam.
Yeah.
Let's go outside for a second.
<i>When you know
she's no high climber</i>
It's the shit I hate, you know?
I give them a gorgeous record,
and they say, "There's no single. "
No superlatives, no thank-yous,
no congratulations.
Just, "Go back in and find it. "
Otherwise...
...I would not be behind.
I'm never behind like this.
- Jane, you're always behind like this.
- No, I've changed. Truly, I have.
Just take your time
and finish the record...
- ... and we'll stay in Malibu.
- You can't stay in Malibu.
- It's a couple weeks...
- It's Bobby's.
- What do you mean?
- I gave the house to Bobby.
You gave the house to Bobby?
Just for a while,
till he's back up on his feet.
He doesn't have feet.
- Bobby's a basket case.
- No, I gave him a deadline.
- Oh, I'm sure that will motivate him.
- Look...
It's complicated.
I feel a little guilty.
- Yeah, what?
- I left him.
- So you gave him the house?
- It was the right thing to do.
Why'd you break up with Bobby?
I thought Bobby was the real thing.
Well, then I got to know him.
- What do you want to eat?
- Curry.
- Sounds good.
- We're going for a bite. Care to join us?
No, thanks. We're exhausted.
No?
Our loss. Other time.
- See you, Jane.
- See you, baby. Bye. Later.
See you.
Hey.
- See you in the morning.
- Unless you want to...
See you in the morning.
Nice to meet you.
They don't have a single.
I'm sorry. I thought Sam
would've explained how things get.
No, he just thought you'd be gone.
I mean, finished.
Happens a lot in this business. Things
shift, plans change, people get fired.
Sure. Of course.
What are you gonna do? Things shift,
plans change, people get fired.
Yeah, we just hadn't planned
on a change of plan, so...
Well, who plans on a change of plan?
I mean, that would be sort
of paranoid, don't you think?
- Do you want something to drink?
- No, thanks.
Look, I think you guys should stay
as long as you want.
Really, I want you to be comfortable.
This has nothing to do with you.
I'm really happy to have you here.
- Want some?
- No, thanks. I'm okay.
- Sam?
- No.
She is so embarrassing.
She's fine. She's amusing.
Oh, yeah, like a minstrel show.
Come on.
Well, she's a little odd.
Her presentation's a little odd,
but I think she means well.
I don't know what she means.
In fact, I never have.
You made it sound
like she was autistic.
She is, in a way. I mean, she makes
the same mistakes over and over.
- She's obviously very accomplished.
- Yeah. The irony of all time.
I'm sorry, Al.
- What are you sorry about?
- For bringing you here.
I should have taken that spot
at Mass General.
Your dad was right.
We should've stayed. I fucked up.
- Stop it. You didn't fuck up.
- I fucked up.
- You didn't tell me she was successful.
- I told you.
You've hardly told me anything
about her.
- You hardly asked.
- That's not true.
- Sleep tight.
- All right.
- Do you think Sam likes me?
- No. Why would he?
There's nothing to like about you.
You're totally unlikable.
You bitch.
Wait. Come here, come here.
Shit.
- I'm sorry, did I wake you?
- Not at all. I can't sleep lately.
My clock's fucked. You don't have
to do that. Carmella's coming.
- It's no problem.
- Don't cut yourself.
Hey, hey, come on, I got it,
really. You're barefoot.
- Why are you up?
- I've gotta be at the hospital.
- It's so early.
- Yep, it's a real job.
- That's too bad.
- No, I don't feel bad about it.
- We should spend some time together.
- Yeah.
- With Alex.
- Yeah.
- She's sweet.
- I think so.
Hey, I've got box seats at the Bowl.
Maybe we could do that.
The four of us? Get some wine,
some weed, some chicken.
- The weather's been fabulous.
- Yeah. I won't have time for a while...
- ... but I'll let you know.
- Okay.
But thanks for the offer.
That sounds nice.
Sure.
That's your new guy?
- How's it going?
- Great.
- Yeah?
- He's a beautiful man.
- I'm really happy.
- Yeah?
We have a really deep connection.
Probably deeper than I've had
with anyone...
- ... even Bobby.
- Wow.
Didn't you have a deep connection
with that guy...
...Randy?
- Randy?
- Yeah, Randy.
The roadie with the limp,
lived here when I was 12.
- Ronny.
- Ronny.
Yeah, I had a connection with Ronny.
It wasn't particularly deep.
- What about Veronica?
- Veronica.
- You got deep with her.
- We stopped having sex...
...after the third month.
Anyway...
...Ian gets me.
This is completely different.
Well, that's great.
That's great, Jane.
Listen...
...Alex is...
...working hard on her dissertation.
And I'd appreciate it if you could keep
it low-key while we're staying here.
Just keeping doors shut and stuff.
I think she'd appreciate it.
- I want her to feel comfortable here.
- Yeah, so do I.
You know, this situation's
kind of foreign to her.
She's used to working
in a lab or an office, alone.
She's not used
to being around people.
Wow, she must get lonely.
Okay.
Okay.
Claudia, I'm not gonna slap
some bullshit together for radio.
<i>- I don't work that way, you know that.
- I hear you. It's all good.</i>
There's a slot open,
and we need to jump.
I gotta have all my elements
for the holidays.
- We need to move units.
- Christmas?
- Fuck that.
- Oh, Claudia...
...please don't take me there.
Please, don't depress me.
I don't care about Christmas.
Fuck Christmas.
This isn't Nat King Cole. You know that.
Why are you up my ass?
This is why we get
in trouble with you.
And this is why you always end up
coming back to me, Claudia.
God, I love that woman.
- Where are we?
- Two minutes.
Okay, this is the locked ward,
obviously...
...and these are the patients
in the locked ward...
...some of whom you'll be getting
to know intimately very, very soon.
I'm not stealing them.
You took my medication.
It's down your sleeve.
It's in her sleeve.
Sara Golan, second-year resident
extraordinaire.
Meet the new recruits.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I think I'm bringing them down.
Tell them it's not so bad.
It's not so bad.
You see, it's not so bad.
All right, onward.
Christmas. Slots and units.
In a limited universe.
- It's depressing, really.
- So up your Wellbutrin.
Rather have Vicodin.
Move that unit, lady in the tracksuit.
- You know what I think?
- I don't, but I'm dying to.
I think we made a beautiful record
and cowards notice last.
You're very deep.
- You think so?
- I do...
- ... when you're not talking.
- Fuck off.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Let me turn it down.
No, it's fine, really.
So, what are you working on
upstairs?
- Excuse me?
- You seem exceedingly absorbed.
Oh, I'm writing.
- What, a novel?
- No, my dissertation.
Brilliant. What's it on?
- What's it on?
- You have a subject?
Specifically?
Yeah. We went to university.
We can handle it.
The genomic determinance of sexual
behaviour in the drosophila fruit fly...
...and its implications
for Homo sapiens.
Really? The sex life of flies?
No, the reproductive behaviour...
...of the fruit fly.
Excuse me.
Oh, he didn't mean it, Alex.
Honestly, he's got low self-esteem.
He had acne as a child.
You cunts.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Yeah, there's not much in here.
We've been doing takeout lately.
Oh, that's okay.
Is there a store nearby?
- Why don't you join us?
- Oh, no, I...
Seriously, Alex, you don't have
to be polite with me.
Polite isn't my thing.
I'm sure Sam told you that.
No, I wasn't being polite.
I should just get some air.
Air's good.
Always better than a cocktail
at this hour.
We'd like you to listen
to the record sometime if you want.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, I'd like to. I'd like that. Thanks.
Well, you'd be helping us out.
It's like a psychic sauna in there.
We're wasted.
Well, I'd love to listen,
but I don't think I'd be much help.
I don't really know anything
about popular music.
Sure, you do.
Anyone with instinct knows about
popular music. That's why it's popular.
You strike me as someone
with strong instincts.
I guess so.
Well, you know when you're repulsed
and when you're turned on, right?
I suppose so, in general, I guess.
That's all it is. Either it pulls you in
or it leaves you cold.
Sorry, you want some?
It's great for the colon.
Oh, no, thanks.
And they're definitely taking it?
Okay, thank you.
Hi, I'm calling about the apartment.
Is it? Okay. All right, thanks.
Everything all right?
Yeah.
What'd you get?
- Food.
- Good timing. I'm famished.
- Get on.
- No, I'm fine. I need the exercise.
You'll have a heart attack
dragging that load up the mountain.
No, it's fine, really.
Jane asked me to get you,
sweetheart. Get on.
I promise I won't tell your parents.
You really didn't have to get me.
I'm fine.
Now, hold on to me.
Tighter.
- So where are you staying now?
- Up in Laurel Canyon.
It's just that the house we're in
was supposed to be empty...
...but my mother is producing
a record there.
And she moved in because she left
her boyfriend...
...and she gave him
her beach house...
...because...
Well, anyway, it's convoluted
and not very interesting.
No, it's definitely interesting.
It'll work out. Really, it's more
a logistics issue at the moment.
- That was you in the car, right?
- Yeah.
You almost killed me.
Yeah, well...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- You should be.
It was unbelievable. Every call I made,
someone had just nabbed it.
I'm fine staying here, honey.
I don't mind. Really, I don't.
She's in your way, Al, you know?
I mean, she has no boundaries.
- You need your privacy.
- She's not in my way.
I'm working in private.
It's not a problem.
What about the noise?
They've been respectful
when the door's closed.
- What about when it's not closed?
- Well, then it's open.
- Can you hear them?
- No, not really.
"Not really," what is that?
That's yes, right?
No, that means, no, not really.
Al, don't get technical. I'm just trying
to work it out. I'm just trying to help.
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.
- Can she pick you up tomorrow?
- She said she could.
- Okay, then I'll start looking.
- Well, good. That'd be good.
Maybe we should look in the Valley.
It's cheaper and quieter.
North Hollywood or something.
<i>I love the girls
and the money</i>
<i>And the shame of life</i>
Yeah, Mickey's here.
Everybody's here. Come over.
I'm not talking about work.
I've got a band with me.
- Hey!
- Hey.
You didn't have to go out.
We made tofu steaks.
Oh, yeah? Sorry we missed that.
- What have you got there?
- Pizza.
You want some?
Lovely.
Delicious.
Real meat.
- Whose kid is that?
- Oh, that's Rowan's baby, China.
Come here, you little heartbreaker.
Are you cold?
Meet my friend, Alex.
Say hello. "Hello. "
- You want your dad?
- Yeah.
Neglectful dad.
- Can I get you two a drink?
- Sure.
Hello?
Hi. Is Sam there?
- Sugar?
- Please. Thank you.
I'm really sorry I woke you up.
No. I'm usually up before 6.
I overslept.
Morning. Sorry.
- Should we go?
- Well, Alex made coffee.
- Do we have time?
- I think so. I drive fast.
Okay.
Thanks for picking him up.
I wasn't expecting to be
apartment hunting. We weren't.
It's not a problem. Really,
I'm happy to. It's right on my way.
- That's convenient. Where do you live?
- In the Valley.
North Hollywood.
- Why can't you stay up here?
- It's a little tight, with everyone...
That's too bad. It's really nice.
I'd sacrifice space
to be up here any day.
- Are you a resident?
- Second-year.
- What do you do?
- I'm writing my dissertation.
- What on?
- Drosophila genomics.
- She's an M.D. as well.
- Wow, that's very impressive.
- Not really.
- Oh, it impresses me.
- Thank you.
- You must have a lot of patience.
I don't know, I couldn't imagine
analysing data all day. It seems so...
...tedious.
Well, it's not meaningless at all.
No, no. I didn't say meaningless.
Did I?
My English is terrible. I'm sorry.
I said tedious, I think.
Well, same difference.
But I didn't mean that.
I meant...
I don't know the word.
Serious. That's all.
It's fine.
Sorry, I didn't mean to...
No, no. I'm sorry, really.
I didn't mean the assault.
Insult. We should probably go.
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah, you too.
Bye.
- Your girlfriend seems nice.
- Yeah.
She was tired.
She's usually more...
She's usually different.
A double degree.
She must love school.
Yeah. She got through fast.
She's really smart.
Yeah, she must be.
And ambitious.
Well, yeah.
Top in our class, actually.
Really?
Yeah.
How can you compete with that?
Methamphetamines, Ecstasy, generic,
ice. We're not sure what he took.
Vital signs haven't stabilized.
Page me if you have questions.
Thanks. You wanna start?
- No, he's yours.
- Okay.
- How you doing, Wyatt?
- I'm fucked up, okay?
Nazis are in the parking lot, waiting
to bang me, and I'm trapped in here.
Okay. How old are you?
- Eighteen.
- You have any family around?
No, I don't have any family, asshole.
Leave my fucking family out of it, you
paranoid Nazi freak in a white coat.
- Sit down.
- Leave my family out of it.
511 stat, okay? Wyatt, sit down.
Sit down. Sit down.
Okay.
What the fuck is 511, huh?
What the fuck is that?
Is that a fucking code?
Is that a fucking code?
Is that a fucking prison code?
Is that a fucking prison code?
Don't fucking take me out.
Please God, don't.
Don't fucking take me out.
Please don't.
Please don't take me out.
- It's okay.
- Please don't.
I'm not feeling that. What's up
with the gallop? The tempo's shit.
- I'm right. Right?
- Yep, tempo's shit.
<i>I could not crawl
back if I tried</i>
No, no, no, no.
Let us get into it.
It's gonna have texture.
Like, you know, like ooze.
Sonic ooze.
Great. Sonic ooze.
Okay, baby, how about
a horn section?
A little Tijuana Brass, maybe?
I heard Herb's in town.
- Let's not get patronizing.
- That's not patronizing.
That was accommodating.
I was accommodating you.
Against my better judgment, even.
<i>There's something
going on around here</i>
<i>I could not
crawl back if I tried</i>
<i>I couldn't wait around</i>
<i>I couldn't wait
another second</i>
<i>There's something
going on around here</i>
<i>I left my baby on
the side of the highway</i>
<i>She just couldn't
see things my way</i>
<i>So tell me why</i>
<i>The beautiful ones
are always crazy</i>
<i>She's whisperin'

<i>I left my baby on
the side of the road</i>
<i>I left her
with a heavy load</i>
<i>Someday</i>
<i>Someday</i>
<i>I will treat you good</i>
<i>You know I should</i>
- Sweet, that's it. That's the direction.
- I've overplayed it.
No. We just gotta
straighten out the beat.
- It should be faster.
- No, I get what she's doing. It's sultry.
She's going for romantic.
Is that what you're going for, Jane?
A love song?
Come on!
Let him go. No, let him go!
Let me at him!
Those are mine.
- What are?
- Your tits.
You're such a brute.
Hello.
Hi.
- Am I interrupting?
- Absolutely not.
It's an unexpected pleasure,
really.
We were just discussing romance.
Come on in. Sit down, come on.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.
Have a good night.
I'm really starting to love this.
It's dated, you know?
It's not dated. We just wrote it.
It doesn't even have a date on it yet.
- Why are you so contrary?
- You wouldn't respect me otherwise.
- You think so?
- Babe...
- ... I know so.
- Good.
I love a man who
speaks his mind...
...even when it's bullshit.
Hey, stranger.
- Hey, you.
- Hey.
What time did you come to bed?
- I tried to wake you.
- Really?
- You didn't move.
- I didn't even feel it.
How did it go yesterday?
- With the apartments.
- Good.
What's the status?
I saw a few things.
Most of them were pretty disgusting.
Yeah. I think it's gonna
take some time.
I was sure there was something
perfect in here, just ready to rent.
So how was work yesterday?
Strange. I had to deal
with a 16-year-old...
...having an Ecstasy-induced psychotic
episode, and he thought I was a Nazi.
How ironic.
- Yeah.
- And upsetting.
Yeah, he was pretty upset.
- I'm sure.
- This one looks good.
- Which one?
- This house in the Valley...
...on Greenleaf.
Right there.
Okay.
Were you in the studio
for a long time?
- No, not long.
- Just taking a break?
Yeah.
- Did you get much work done?
- Yeah.
I think they're pretty close
to finishing.
No, on your...
...dissertation.
Oh. Yeah, it's going really well.
- Did you enjoy yourself?
- Where?
In the studio.
Yeah, I did, actually.
- It was stimulating.
- Good.
Jesus.
I don't know how you two stand getting
up so early. That totally burned me out.
- Hello.
- Hi.
You're right on time.
Oh, he's very friendly.
He's a pussycat.
You see that?
He likes you already.
Come on in.
I'll show you the house.
I want you to take the gown
out of your bag and put it on.
- This isn't appropriate for public.
- You don't understand naked.
Naked is inner.
I am here with you.
There is no shame.
There is no separation.
And...
...I'm not ill.
Yes, you are ill, Gloria.
And I have no need
for a green synthetic nightie...
...used to conceal the essence
of my supple skin...
...and my aching soul...
...in the barren desert
that is this land.
I'm moving in with my son
in Costa Mesa.
He thinks I'm lonely.
Truth is, he's lonely.
Sweet kid.
Just can't seem to connect.
Me and my wife lived here 40 years.
It's lovely, really.
It's really lovely.
You seem like a very nice person.
I hope you take the place.
<i>- Been 40 days since I
don't know when - Come on.</i>
- Come on! You're nothing!
- I just saw her with my best friend
<i>Do you know what I mean</i>
Come on, baby!
Pussy!
<i>- I just saw her yesterday
- Fucking pussy!</i>
I don't know about trust.
Maybe she just needed a nap
or something.
Believe me.
She's been belligerent
with everybody else.
I dealt with her last year.
I just listened to her, really.
Yeah. Well, listening...
...it's better than medicating,
no matter what they tell you.
Can I tell you something?
Yeah. Sure.
Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine, thanks. You?
Fine, thanks.
Did I leave you enough room?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I'll see you in the morning.
<i>Do you know what I mean</i>
Another day at the office.
<i>Do you know what I mean</i>
All right.
- Hey, how's it going?
- Good, you?
Okay.
Hey, come on in the water.
It's delicious.
Maybe later. Thanks.
You're always welcome.
In fact, more than welcome.
Obviously, you're welcome.
Fucking hell, it's your house.
- I'm sorry.
- It's not your fault.
Someone else got there first.
The house was gone.
It wouldn't be the worst thing to stay
here a little longer. It's comfortable.
Well, depends on your definition
of comfort.
I mean, Al, I'm hardly ever here.
It's not for me, it's for you.
Is it?
- Can you get me some lemonade?
- I'll see if there's some around.
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know.
Whatever you hit me with took me
down. I feel fucking drugged.
Yeah, well, you were drugged.
- I don't like downers.
- You weren't liking the uppers either.
Yeah.
- I told you not to call my house.
- Look, I had to contact your family.
You're underage. That's the law.
My mom's gonna kick my ass.
I mean, she's freaking now.
But she's gonna torch my fucking ass
when I get out of here.
Why are things so wrong
with your mom?
I don't know.
You seem like you do.
She just doesn't get me, all right?
She's in my face about my grades,
my hair, my friends, tattoos.
All this other shit. You know?
I can't do nothing right.
So why should I care?
<i>I left my baby on
the side of a highway</i>
<i>She just couldn't
see things my way</i>
<i>Someday</i>
Fuck.
- What?
- He missed the punch, fucked up...
Mickey, could you keep that to yourself
next time, let him play through?
Let me talk to him.
Sorry. Yeah. It's not there,
but that's a direction.
- It's okay?
- Yeah.
We'll finesse it in the mix.
We'll make it work.
What do you think?
- Truthfully?
- No, lie to me. Yeah, truthfully.
I'm not feeling it.
You're not feeling it.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay. Don't apologize.
Just tell me what you mean.
I don't know what I mean, exactly.
I just... I mean, I...
I guess it's just not pulling me in.
Or it feels like it's not pulling them in...
...exactly...
Or enough.
I don't know.
They don't seem inspired.
Inspired?
- Yeah?
- Progress report.
Excuse me?
Progress report?
No, "Hello, how are you?"
Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming
me up.
What?
I love capitalism as much as
the next guy, but this is off the charts.
Your commerce is so far up
my ass, I can't sit up.
Listen, the Age of Aquarius
never happened, okay?
<i>- Get real. This is commerce.
- I want to tell you something...</i>
...for your soul. Pushing for Christmas
and radio play...
...will only amount to shit
and wrapping paper.
I don't know what happened, Jane.
We really used to be on the same page.
I don't know what happened
either, Claudia.
I guess you started exercising.
<i>Gotta go.</i>
Bitch.
Cunt.
Can we just say how lovely
Jane looks today?
Can we just have a moment
of appreciation for our sweet...
...lovely Jane?
Jane rocks.
Get the fuck out of my chair.
I had a math teacher in high school
who was sort of my mentor.
You know, I was one
of those science geeks...
...and my mother wasn't really around.
So he took me under his wing,
and he convinced me...
...that I should be a doctor.
Which seemed like the right idea
at the time.
You know, I guess I needed
to prove myself.
To who?
Who were you trying
to prove yourself to?
I don't know. My math teacher?
Your math teacher?
You got through Harvard Medical
School for your math teacher?
Yeah, no.
I guess I was trying
to prove myself to myself.
You know, I needed...
- ... to prove that I wasn't a loser.
- A loser?
Why would you think
you're a loser?
I was around a lot of losers
growing up and...
Not worthless-type loser...
...or, you know, bad person.
Just...
Just lost. People at loose ends.
And I didn't want to be that.
I wanted to be anything but that.
You're everything but that.
I set up a meeting with his mom.
It's not protocol,
but I think it'll help.
Is he still violent?
No. No, he was never violent.
I thought you had to restrain him.
No, I sedated him.
- Oh, I thought he was psychotic.
- Huh? No.
He had a psychotic episode.
He OD'd on...
...methamphetamines. But...
...he's not psychotic in general.
<i>When did you start reading
Spin magazine?</i>
- I'm not really reading it.
- You just looking at it?
I'm skimming it.
- Is it helping?
- Yeah, it's informative.
- It's good for an overview.
- What, like a primer?
- Yeah, something like that.
- Getting the basics, a light survey...
...of popular culture.
- Are you teasing me?
- No.
<i>Should I be reading
the Journal of Medicine...</i>
<i>...or the Harvard Review?
Would that be more appropriate?</i>
- Something more scholarly?
- No, come on, Al. I was teasing.
I could harass you about those porno
magazines, but I didn't even bring it up.
Wha...?
Come on. I don't care about
the porno magazines.
<i>- I just didn't know you liked Juggs.
- Oh, God.</i>
- Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
- Please, stop it. Your breasts are fine.
Your breasts are...
...perfect.
Really.
Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?
Where did you come up
with that fucking number?
I'm guessing from what you said.
Well, I'm 16 years older than you.
That's a lifetime of fucking.
And I am not apologizing.
My past isn't about you.
- Oh, that is cold.
- No, it's not. It's clear.
You're gonna keep me
in my place, are you?
I'm not gonna keep you anywhere.
You are free to move around.
Well, I'm not moving,
for your information.
You can work your tough-girl thing,
but I know you're in love with me.
That's irrelevant.
<i>Do I ever wonder</i>
<i>More than words can say</i>
<i>Heaven knows
it's hard enough to pray</i>
<i>Let me tell you something</i>
<i>There's a change in me</i>
<i>- Even now you're gone,
you'll always be - Kind of...</i>
...tired, babe.
You know?
<i>My only love</i>
- You're up early.
- I know, and I'm not happy about it.
- You need some Valium?
- I don't wanna get back into that again.
Yeah, that wouldn't be good.
Try swimming. It helps.
- So how are you? How's work going?
- Good.
- Just not sleeping enough myself.
- Oh, I'm sure.
- Hospital's been busy.
- A lot of psychos, huh?
No, just a lot of...
...pained souls.
Listen, I appreciate your interest
in Alex.
I meant to tell you that.
I really like Alex. I like her a lot.
She's smart.
I was a little protective of her
when we first got here.
I just wasn't sure how she was
gonna deal with your scene.
I think she's dealing just fine
with my scene.
I think she likes it. Obviously,
she's getting stoned with you...
<i>- ... and she's reading Spin.
- I don't read Spin. I've never read Spin.</i>
She found her own way into the studio.
It had nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
It's always like that with you,
isn't it? They...
They always just happen
to find their way in.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means you're charmed,
that's all.
Someone's looking out for you.
Nobody's looking out for you?
I'm sorry.
Come on. Your life looks good
from my perspective.
- I've worked for what I have.
- And I haven't?
- You are so stuck on the negative.
- I'm not.
Yes, you are.
- You've blocked out all the fun we had.
- I haven't blocked it out. It's all filed.
What about the trip to Veracruz?
Yeah. When Ronny went to jail?
Before that, when we were out
on his boat.
In the storm? That was fun?
That sucked.
No, it didn't.
You thought it was exciting.
I wasn't excited. I was hysterical.
There's a huge difference
between hysteria and excitement.
Are we ever gonna have
a relationship?
We're having a relationship.
Here we are, having it.
Ian's got a room at the Chateau.
We'll stay there...
- ... you can have the place to yourself.
- You should stay.
Alex is still looking for an apartment,
and we need something permanent...
...so just stay.
Why don't you ask her? Maybe
she wants to be alone in the interim.
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
I mean, she can't stay away from you
as it is.
He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine
and then lock her up.
I think she wants to be locked up.
Yeah, exactly.
<i>Make your analysis at first...</i>
<i>...with three general patterns
of emotional response.</i>
<i>Rage is the response
to the primary stimulus of thwarting.</i>
- Should I be embarrassed for us?
- I am. I really am.
You gonna have another?
- You know, I should probably go.
- Oh, come on, Golan.
How often do you get a night
and a morning off?
- I'd stay for another.
- Okay.
<i>...and the emotional response to love...</i>
<i>...is usually the result
of a show of affection or favour.</i>
- Tom, can I use your phone?
- Yeah, it's right over there.
- I think we'd do really well together.
- Absolutely.
For a while.
God, will you get past the cynicism?
I just broke up with somebody, baby.
I thought you forgot all about him.
<i>Hello?</i>
Al?
<i>- Who are you with?
- Just some of the residents.</i>
I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving,
and I don't want to be rude.
You want to come down?
No. I'll see you when you get home.
All right.
You're ageist.
- That's what it is.
- Oh, please.
Then what are you afraid of?
Breaking your heart.
Running your ass
into the ground, buddy.
Bollocks.
Why do you want to ruin this
with domesticity?
Because...
...I've never met a braver woman...
...and I'm deeply, deeply
attached to you.
Looks like we've got company.
- How you doing, Alex?
- Okay, I think.
- Getting some work done?
- No. Not tonight.
- Where's Sam?
- Out.
What, without you?
- Well, I didn't want to go.
- Pour yourself a drink.
- Spend time with us.
- Get a drink and come back out.
- Are you sure?
- She's sure. I'm positive.
I'll have another whisky sour
while you're at the bar.
So will Jane.
Cheers.
Tasty, eh?
It's a good combination.
You made it perfectly.
You should be a bartender.
- Do you want to come in?
- No, that's okay.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Oh, have you
just washed your hair?
- No, I haven't.
- So?
So I just don't want to get wet.
Really? You seem like you do.
- Cut it out.
- What? She wants to swim.
- She's afraid to get wet.
- I'm not afraid.
You little tart.
You know what, you've had it.
- Shit! God! I can't believe you!
- See what I have to put up with?
- It's not so bad, is it?
- It's freezing.
That's because
your clothes are wet, silly.
- You really are a jackass. God!
- No. No name-calling now.
We're all adults here.
<i>Ain't got nothing at all</i>
<i>Sweet nothing</i>
- That's better, isn't it?
- Well, it's definitely warmer.
I'd much rather be in here
than out there in that cold world.
You're so polite, Alex.
It's okay to leave the ivory tower
and live a little.
<i>He will let you up</i>
<i>But he'll let you down</i>
<i>Sweet nothing</i>
<i>You ain't got
nothing at all</i>
- Yes. I can drive.
- Well, you shouldn't. You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
I drank less than you.
No, you did not.
- Well, you want to kill me again?
- I didn't kill you the first time, did I?
- Goddamn it, you're flustering me.
- Turn it to the right.
- I know how to open a door.
- Apparently, you don't.
- Give me a break. I'm drunk.
- You should let me drive.
Get in.
Sara.
Yeah?
I think we should take the high road.
What would that be?
Sublimation.
Is that okay?
It's intellectual.
- I know.
- Not very honest.
Well...
Not very satisfactory.
Satisfying.
I think you know what I mean.
Al?
Hey.
Al?
You up?
- Hi.
- You up?
- I am now.
- Can we talk?
Okay.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just...
...wondering about something.
Okay.
Why does your father
hate psychiatrists?
He doesn't hate psychiatrists.
Okay, so...
...why does he hate me?
He doesn't hate you.
He thinks you're great.
Why are you concerned about
what he thinks suddenly?
You know, he's a puritan.
He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
He doesn't know anything about us.
Do you think that we should've...
...gotten married before?
Before when?
Before coming out here?
He runs around, spends my money on
drugs and ends up in a mental hospital!
Oh, I'm so close to letting go on him.
I'm at the end of my rope here.
I think that what's going on with Wyatt
is complicated...
...and I don't think your anger
is helping him with his problems.
My anger?
I'm not angry. I'm furious!
Because this is all about me,
you see.
I will not tolerate disgusting,
degenerate behaviour...
...and disrespect for me
and my values...
Mrs. Jones, listen. Give your values
a rest for a second.
Your kid's in trouble.
<i>May your shade
be sweet</i>
<i>And float upon the lakes</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus, Claudia.
Give me a fucking break.
My relationship with Ian
has nothing to do with this.
It's none of your business anyway.
No. It is not slowing anything down.
These conversations
are slowing us down.
I can't believe I'm listening to this.
That was totally patronizing.
Claudia. It's Ian McKnight.
Lovely. I don't know why you're
so fascinated with our sex life...
...but for the record,
Jane's an amazing shag.
More to the point, we're just
about done with the single.
I'm sure you'll be orgasmic when you
hear it. Let's give the telephone a rest.
Cheers.
Great.
You're a fucking diplomat.
This is it. It's going to hell.
Fuck her.
Who cares? We'll take it
somewhere else.
- You hire a lawyer.
- That's how I want to finish.
- What, with a lawsuit?
- No. With that song.
- Which song?
- The song I just played you.
- It's a ballad.
- So what?
- You want me to hand them a ballad?
- That's right.
You're kidding, right?
Tell me you're kidding.
No. I'm not fucking kidding.
- Alex was right.
- Alex was right?
- The other song doesn't pull you in.
- It pulled me right across the room.
I'm serious.
- Is this about Alex?
- No.
Alex doesn't know about this.
She's into flies and domination.
Determinism.
- Ian.
- Jane.
Ian!
Do you like it?
- Jane?
- What?
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Yeah?
I said I did.
Well, all right then.
Let's just finish the record, darling.
I can't stand to watch Claudia
wank you off any longer.
It's starting to make me jealous.
<i>I could look in your face</i>
<i>For a thousand years</i>
<i>It's like a civil war</i>
<i>Of pain and of cheer</i>
<i>If you was a horse</i>
<i>I could help you
with your chains</i>
<i>I could ride you
through the fields</i>
<i>By your fiery mane</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
<i>And float upon the lakes</i>
<i>Where the sun could be</i>
<i>Made of honey</i>
<i>I'd cry diamonds
while you burn</i>
<i>'Cause no one
here can save you</i>
Oh, God. Sorry. Excuse me.
Sam? Hold on one second.
I'm just gonna...
- Hey.
- Hello.
Where?
No, I can't hear you.
There a lot of people there?
Yeah. I guess, like, 15, 20 or so.
Shrimp cocktail
and something else.
No, I didn't see any crab cakes.
- Do you want to come up?
- No. I probably won't.
No. No, stay.
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
Okay. I will.
I promise.
Were you trailing me?
Maybe.
Why didn't you catch up to me?
Sara?
I was sublimating you.
You're not meant to be in a band.
You're meant to work in a bank.
And everything else is happening.
I'm not usually so aggressive.
- I don't believe that.
- I'm not.
I just...
I don't really know you.
I...
I just feel connected to you.
I feel...
I feel safe with you,
like it's okay to be honest.
It's just one of those things.
I'm just attracted to you.
And it's not just because
I think you're incredibly sexy.
I think that you're incredibly
attractive too, Sara. I do.
You do?
Yeah. I think about you.
Trust me.
A lot.
How do you think about me?
How?
Yeah.
Do you think about
having sex with me?
Yeah.
How?
How do I think about
having sex with you?
Yeah.
Do you think about me
going down on you?
Yeah.
- That's part of it.
- Yeah, me too.
I think about how you'd taste.
I'm sure you'd taste sweeter.
- Do you resist me?
- No.
- Do you give yourself over?
- Yeah.
- Completely?
- Completely.
That gets me off.
You're easy.
No. With you I am.
So do I get to...?
Do I get to work on you
for a while...
...or do we just fall asleep?
You can work on me
all night long.
I mean, you're with someone.
Why would I let myself
fall in love with you?
What, like...
...I'm just an object to you?
I'm just, like, a piece of ass?
- You just looking to get laid?
- Yeah. Right.
- God, you're like a girl.
- Oh, thanks. That's really flattering.
Yeah, it is.
Maybe that's why I like you.
Are you having a sexuality crisis?
No. I'm not having
any kind of crisis.
You're lucky, you know that?
No. I don't know that.
Why am I lucky?
You can control your heart.
- Hey, thanks for coming out, Darla.
- Good night. Thank you.
- It sounds amazing.
- Thanks.
- I'll get the rest this week.
- Yeah, no problem. Good night.
Hello? Yeah.
It's Ian in the penthouse.
We need another bottle
of Chateau Marmont.
Sorry. Dom Perignon.
Cheers. Thanks.
I think it's more comfortable inside.
I think it's one of the best records
I've done.
I think it's the best record
you've done too.
I didn't say "the best. "
- She said the best, didn't she?
- I thought she said "the last. "
You see?
You saved the best for last.
I know it's not the last.
No, don't go. Don't go.
- You should get some sleep.
- No, we never sleep.
Why have you got your clothes on?
- What are you talking about?
- You look so much better with them off.
Come here.
We've been entertaining you
for a while...
...so why don't you entertain us?
What do you want me to do?
Finish it.
Look, you give her an inch,
she takes a mile.
I think we should stop.
Oh, babe.
Come on. Not now.
- I'm sorry.
- No.
You're right.
I...
I didn't...
Sorry.
Can I talk to you for a second?
- You should be with her if you want.
- I don't want to. I wanna be with you.
- I want you to be with her.
- I can't be with her.
- Why not?
- She's Sam's girlfriend.
They're about to break up.
It's obvious.
- She's throwing herself at us.
- She's throwing herself, I can't do it.
Jane...
Look, I've done some weird shit
in my life, and I'm glad I have...
...because I have enjoyed 99 % of it, but
I'm not screwing my son's girlfriend...
...and I won't lay there
and watch you do it.
Oh, who's gonna know?
I'll know.
- Hey. What took you so long?
- Sorry.
Just crushing the grapes.
Back here.
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.
Sorted.
Put it right there.
No worries.
Is this the party?
What are you doing here?
You're a sick pig. You know that?
- Nothing...
- You're a fucking greedy punk.
Okay, mate, slow down.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Stop it!
- Get the fuck off me, you nutter!
Stop it!
Oh, you cunt!
Jesus Christ. Sam, stop it.
- What are you doing?
- What am I doing?
- What the fuck were you doing?
- Are you all right?
Oh, shit!
- It's not what you think it is.
- You have lost your shit!
- It's not her fault. It's my fault.
- No, it is my fault.
Well, it's not my fucking fault!
- You're not getting away with this.
- What?
- Shutting me out!
- You reduce it to that?
Jesus! Get some therapy!
Finally, please, get some help!
- You get some therapy!
- I don't need it!
- That is exactly your problem!
- My problem? You're unbelievable!
This is why I never come back! Things
always spin out of control with you!
You're like a 2-year-old.
Like a fucking infant!
How did you get to be so rigid?
At least I'm living in reality!
At least I have dignity!
Dignity? Jesus!
Why are you so afraid?
Afraid? What are you talking about?
You're insane!
Jane? I'm sorry, can I ask you
to step outside?
Fuck you, Phillip.
I'm sorry...
Can I get you some ice?
Yes!
I know. I know.
It was my fault.
- It just happened.
- These things don't just happen.
- You got out of bed with...
- I didn't sleep with her.
- No details! Not one fucking detail!
- I don't know what happened.
- I got caught up. I got confused.
- Confused? Psychotic is more like it!
I didn't think. I didn't think.
- I never learned.
- Learned what?
- This!
- This? What is this?
- How to fuck up!
- You have fucking mastered it!
It didn't mean anything to me!
I don't want them!
I don't feel anything for them!
I don't want either of them.
I want you!
I wanna be with you, you asshole!
You fucking stupid, fucking asshole!
Stupid asshole?
I'm fucking keeping this together!
I'm fucking trying to keep this together!
I wanna make it right!
- How you doing? You all right?
- Yeah, okay.
I...
I wanted to apologize.
Oh, no, we finished with that
sorry business already.
Sorry for getting you
into this situation.
No, you didn't get me into anything.
I got myself into whatever we got into.
- I was just curious about you.
- And I, you.
You're the least likely person
in the world for me.
- Are you insulting me now?
- No.
No, not at all.
A compliment.
I think you helped me.
Okay, a little positivity.
Yeah, you helped open me up.
Yeah, and I would've opened you up
further if I had my way.
- That's disgusting.
- No, not really. It's honest.
- You should work on your manners.
- I know.
I'm trying, believe me.
I wanna tell you something.
All right.
It doesn't matter
who's right or wrong.
I made mistakes, a lot of them,
I know that.
I live with them every day.
The hardest thing I live with is knowing
how much I've disappointed you.
I haven't been a very good parent.
I know that.
I fucked up.
But I've always loved you.
You're my baby, man.
Hello?
Yeah. May I say who's calling?
You've got a lovely accent, Sara.
Very compelling.
Where are you from?
What a coincidence.
I'm eating a bagel right now.
Hang on.
It's Sara from Israel for you.
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.
<i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah, I'm just taking
a mental health day.
How is your mental health?
Haven't quite gotten to mine yet.
I'm still dealing with everyone else's.
It's not true, that thing
you said last night.
What thing I said last night?
The thing about my heart.
It's not true at all.
<i>I can't control my heart.</i>
I mean...
...I wouldn't want to even if I could.
<i>- Sara?
- Yeah.</i>
Can I call you right back?
<i>Yeah.</i>

<i>Where the sun could be</i>
<i>Made of honey</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
<i>And float upon the lakes</i>
<i>Where the sun could be</i>
<i>Made of honey</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
<i>And float upon the lakes</i>
<i>May your shade be sweet</i>
