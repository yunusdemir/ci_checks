Hi.
(Screaming)
Parker.
I'm on my way.
Parker, where you headed?
Got that paperwork ready for the
hearing this afternoon?
It's on your desk.
Good.
What was your first name again?
Christopher.
Well, listen, Chris,
I've got reservations
over at Buddakan for lunch.
My wife was supposed to join me,
but she's cancelled, again.
How would you like to join me?
Buddakan lunch--
fantastic.
Thank you, but I do have plans.
Plans. With whom?
A friend.
Well, I hope it's worthwhile.
Make sure he's on time.
MAN:
Oh, there it is.
That's the scene I like.
See, first she sprays him
with mace.
His eyes are burning,
and then... bam!
Oh, I would pay extra for that.
A hot piece of ass like that?
Oh, beating you near dead.
That's gotta be good.
The janitor should know better
than to corner a young lady
when there's a serial killer
on the loose.
Okay, well, see, the janitor,
that's Clarence.
He's not the brightest bulb...
He's not the sharpest tool...
He's a retard.
He's a big retard.
He's-- I guess the medical term
is he's fuckin' dopey.
Is he pressing charges?
Yes he's pressing charges.
What are you, an idiot?
Of course! Look at it!
She's gonna go to
the gas chamber.
And you were the arresting
officer, I take it.
Guilty as charged, sir.
So am I to assume
that there was a number of
flagrant procedural violations
that you may or may not have
made that would most likely
just throw this case
right out of court?
None.
None?
Absolutely none.
Is that you with an erection,
arresting her?
A what?
An erection?
Yeah. Yeah, but you know,
there's no law in the books
that says that
you can't arrest someone
when you have
a previous, uh, erection.
Well, that's something that
internal affairs
would have to look into.
Yeah, but, you know something,
that gets into so much
paperwork, and you--
Right. I'm done talking
to you, actually.
And I'm just gonna go ahead and
bail her out,
and I'm gonna want all these
charges dropped.
Yeah! I was just gonna say that.
Could-- could I go there
and say goodbye to her?
Actually, I'd prefer if I could
have someone else
walk me to her cell.
Uh, yeah, I could lead you--
Are you done?
Yeah, I'm done.
I'm done.
(Buzzer ringing)
Nice socks.
They took my boots from me.
I was told they were too heavy,
and could be used as
a weapon on the inside.
So, where we eating?
Jim's? Tony Luke's?
Ooh, let's get Korean.
My lunch break was spent
posting your bail, Ari,
with the district attorney, who
nearly remembered my first name.
Ooh la la! I see where
your priorities are.
Where would you be right now
without me?
No, wait, let me rephrase that.
Where would you be right now,
had I never changed
my major to law?
I'd be without a lawyer,
but the band would probably
still be together.
Really? I'm serious, Ari.
It's gotta stop.
Stop what?
I'm done bailing you out from
department store rampages
and midnight drunken benders,
because it's immature
college nonsense.
You've obviously forgotten
that college was fun,
and that what just happened was
far from nonsense.
I don't know if you knew this,
but there's a serial killer
preying on girls like me.
I doubt you'll have
to worry about him.
Him who?
The Calendar Girl Killer?
Why not?
I'm not good enough for him?
You're not his type.
How would you know?
Are you the Calendar
Girl Killer,
Christopher James Parker?
Driven to kill by his
controlling
and boring bitch
of a girlfriend?
Don't call my girlfriend
a bitch.
So you're conceding that she is
boring and controlling.
Yeah, if by "boring and
controlling" you mean
that Francis has yet to use her
one phone call
to fill my lunch break
with police matters,
then yeah, boring is
an excellent word.
Your watch is fast.
I know. Punctuality is extremely
important to the DA,
and I'm trying to make
a good impression.
How responsible of you.
Wait, you're really leaving?
I'm starving!
So am I. Luckily for me,
my bitch of a girlfriend
is making boring chicken tonight
with a controlling side salad.
Don't live it up
all on one night.
I hope you get mugged for real
on the way home.
Love you too.
Least you still love me, Xanax.
♪
(Traffic honking)
Shit.
Open up already, Ari,
I'm freezing out here!
Byron! The diner is always open!
Every day I tell you that you
don't have to wait for me.
Why won't you listen to me?
You were half-an-hour late.
At 11:30, I'm just trying to get
a cup of coffee.
The diner does not open
when I walk in the door,
and close when I leave.
I swear to God, if you don't go
in before me, right now,
I'm gonna put antifreeze in your
fucking cup of coffee.
I just want a cup of coffee,
is all.
Fuck!
Here you go.
Oh, no, that's too much.
Please. You're worth
every penny.
Oh, thank you!
Hi, Ari. Welcome.
You're late. Again.
And you smell like hoagies.
These things happen.
Look, Ari, your tables are
getting antsy, all right?
And Byron's been
peeing himself outside,
waiting for a GD cup of coffee.
You have tables five, six,
seven, and the counter.
The counter, Bob? Come on.
No one ever sits
the fucking counter.
It just so happens, Ari, that
there's someone there right now.
Give me a
fourth table.
Go!
That guy's a really good tipper.
You should give him to Mandy.
Now.
Hey, Ari.
Welcome to the Aramingo Diner.
My name is Ari. I'll be your
waitress this morning.
You look gorgeous.
Our specials today
are go fuck yourself
and what are you doing here?
I missed you too.
I have real customers.
What do you want?
I will have a coffee and an egg
sandwich, please.
But if it's possible,
could I have some vegetarian
bacon, and not the real bacon?
Trying to watch
my animal fat intake.
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard. You?
I'll have the same.
That girl needs
to find God.
or you are just here
to piss me off?
This has been the worst year
of my life.
I wanna give us another try.
Didn't I see you, like a month
ago, with some cute redhead?
Louis Vuitton bag,
pretty little manicured paws.
That didn't work out.
Oh!
It didn't?
Is it still hard
to work things out...
with your temper?
That was an accident.
I think you should
find another diner.
You know, you'd get better tips
if you didn't
chase the customers out before
they ordered.
He wasn't a customer.
Look at Mandy.
She gets good tips because
she's sunny and sweet.
Personality plus, all the time.
No, she gets good tips because
you give her all the good tables
with all the good customers,
and I get stuck with the lonely
mongrels at the counter
who can't find anyone
to share a booth with.
What about Leonard and Tony?
They share a booth.
ARI:
Seriously? Leonard collects
ketchup bottles.
What about Tony?
He thinks that's cool.
You see, Ari,
that's your problem.
You mistreat your customers,
and they mistreat you back.
Honey attracts bees,
because it's sweet.
You attract those guys, Ari,
because, well--
I get it!
I suck.
Yeah, well, you do.
But just study Mandy.
Fucking Mandy.
(Screaming)
Ari!
Are you okay?
(Giggling)
No. I'm taking a break.
You just got here!
It's an addiction, Bob.
Deal with it.
I'm clocking out.
Here's your cheque.
You're kicking me out already?
No, Byron. I'm not kicking you
out. The diner is open 24 hours.
The only time we close
is New Year's Eve.
Is today New Year's Eve? No.
So the diner's not closing.
I personally am leaving,
but I'm sure another waitress
can refill the cup of coffee
that you've been nursing
for the past eight hours,
so you don't have to leave,
but you do have to pay me
for the fucking coffee.
All right, I see how it is.
Settling up.
Give me your paw.
Give me your paw.
I went to the bank today, so...
You can keep all of that.
Little more than 79 cents, so...
I hate you. So much.
See you tomorrow, Ari.
(Yelling)
Jesus Christ, Julie,
are you trying to scare
the shit out of me?
No! What makes you think that?
You do know there's
a serial killer
loose in Philadelphia, right?
That's exactly why
I'm back in town.
You're looking at the Calendar
Girl Killer's Miss August
in the <i>Dateline</i> re-enactment!
That's great.
I'm freezing my ass off.
There's just
no good work out west.
I mean, the only work I would
get was for the Spanish channel,
and that was hardly acting.
No movies?
Porn or horror.
That's all that's out there.
I don't know which is worse.
Like, porn, at least they don't
try to church it up, you know?
It is what it is.
But horror tries to hide it.
It's always the same thing.
Some vapid big-chested girl,
glistening in blood,
getting chased by a killer
who's just close enough
to rip her clothes off,
piece by piece until...
she runs out of stairs
to climb up.
It's just so degrading.
Ari, are you listening?
No.
(Speaking foreign language)
Jon came into the diner today.
What did he want?
He wants to get back together.
And you're not seriously
considering it.
Are you?!
The last thing I want to do is
go another New Year's Eve
with no one to kiss at midnight.
You do remember who left you
alone at midnight, don't you?
It wasn't like it was that bad.
These were an accident.
I remember differently,
I guess.
How's Chris?
Is he still with, um--
Yeah.
I think their days
are numbered, though.
He's amazingly bored.
I think I'll have
the feta cheese omelette.
Terrible choice.
Belgian waffle? Blueberries?
Side of scrapple.
That's it.
Hey, hey, hey! Francis, Chris!
Good to see you guys.
Hey, funny thing you guys are
here, huh? Look what I just got.
It's your holiday card.
Thank you.
I love it. It's beautiful.
Hey, speaking of holidays,
I would like to cordially
invite you both
to my New Year's Eve party.
It's on New Year's Eve,
as usual.
As I recall,
we missed you last year.
Yeah, we had a family
engagement.
Ah, bummer.
But hey, what do you think about
this year, huh?
It's gonna be a rager.
I... don't see why we couldn't
make an appearance, Bob.
Ari raves about your
bacon-wrapped scallops.
Hot damn! Yes!
Hey, we'll see you there,
then, all right?
See you guys then, okay?
Have a good one.
Well...
if it isn't Ansel Adams.
Excuse me?
From outside, the other day,
right?
And you're the pin-up.
Ari.
Can I get you
something to drink?
Just coffee.
You're not one of those
"just coffee" people, are you?
Just coffee.
Don't you think it's an
inopportune time
to be walking around the city
with a camera strapped
around your neck?
Well, this coming from a girl
who poses for photos taken by a
random man on the street.
Good point.
MANDY:
Hey, Ari!
Hey, Mandy, go to hell.
Ooh! That's a nice camera!
Hey, Ari, weren't you a
photography major in college?
Creative writing.
Oh, wow! I was a musical theatre
major. Also creative.
But you know what they say about
those degrees.
It's like a BW--
Bachelor of Waitressing.
Oh, I'm Mandy, by the way.
I'm Phil.
(Screaming)
Phil! That was your
dad's name, huh?
That's a small world.
What?
Okay. Bye!
What was that all about?
I... hate her.
Why? She seems nice.
She's a bitch.
She's only perky all the time
because she gets
all the good customers.
The ones that actually wear
clothes that fit properly
I get stuck with the dregs of
society at the counter.
Um...
I'm at the counter.
Um...
Do you have a real job?
I freelance.
So close.
So, writing, huh?
Did you waste all your money on
art school too?
I wouldn't say "wasted."
Yeah... wasted.
(Laughing)
What the fuck?!
Jon?
Sorry!
Who's Phil.
None of your business.
So, what? Did you just happen to
be in the neighbourhood?
Booty call from some blonde?
Anger management classes?
Filling prescriptions?
I have something for you.
Please leave.
Go in.
<i>We're here tonight with noted</i>
<i>author and psychiatrist,</i>
<i>Dr. Cassidy. Dr. Cassidy,</i>
<i>thanks for joining us tonight.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Philadelphia police have</i>
<i>basically been eluded</i>
<i>for almost a year now by this</i>
<i>so-called Calendar Girl Killer.</i>
<i>Who, exactly, are</i>
<i>police looking for,</i>
<i>in your estimation, and who do</i>
<i>you believe this killer to be?</i>
Let's watch something else.
DR. CASSIDY:
<i>Well, you know,</i>
<i>it's difficult to say,</i>
<i>but he's obviously</i>
<i>no one's fool.</i>
<i>And in my opinion,</i>
<i>I believe he's very bright,</i>
<i>and very well educated.</i>
<i>All right, then, but what is</i>
<i>going to possess somebody</i>
<i>who is presumably</i>
<i>very bright</i>
<i>and presumably</i>
<i>very well educated</i>
<i>to go on a killing spree</i>
<i>like this one?</i>
Ari, please.
DR. CASSIDY:
<i>It's most likely</i>
<i>a culmination of things.</i>
<i>Where all the victims in this</i>
<i>particular case are women,</i>
<i>in my opinion, it must be</i>
<i>a repressed hatred</i>
<i>for either his mother</i>
<i>or his sister.</i>
You don't need to see that.
Hitting a little
too close to home?
No, just don't need you getting
yourself all worked up.
I know how you get.
Do you?
You know me so well, don't you.
Always knew how to treat a lady.
Ari, I've changed, okay?
It took us being apart to
realize what I did wrong,
but I promise, I'm not gonna
make that mistake again.
I just wanna make you happy.
Really?
Whatever it takes.
It would make me happy
if you left.
Seriously?
I just got here.
There's nothing
to talk about, Jon.
If you're not even
gonna hear me out,
why the fuck did you let me in?
You're all the same.
Fuckin' learn.
<i>What makes him so unique</i>
<i>and so fascinating:</i>
<i>he doesn't just see these</i>
<i>killings as killings.</i>
<i>He sees them as a lead-up</i>
<i>to his art, if you will.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
I have one from Portugal.
Really?
One from Germany,
France, Spain.
Really?
And even Turkey.
My ketchup shelf reads
like an Atlas
of the four corners
of the world.
Have you ever been to any of
these places, Leonard?
Well, I have done a tad of
travelling in my time.
Has I ever told you about my
trip to Las Vegas...
Nevada!
There I was, roaming the--
Look at me.
There I was, roaming the strip,
with a belly full of mojito,
and a ball of $2 bills
burning a hole in my pocket.
The blood on my hands
had dried by then.
What 'cha reading?
Nothing. Nothing.
Nothing sure seems
to have you worried
quite a bit there, Bobbo.
Well, if you must know, Ari,
the Calendar Girl Killer sent
this letter to the paper.
"It's been quite a year.
"My calendar is nearly complete,
"and what kind of artist
would I be
"if I didn't save
the best for last?
"I've chosen someone very
special for Miss December.
"She's nothing like
my other girls,
"who were little more
than eye-candy.
"An adventurous brunette,
a dark loner,
"bitter, yet somehow sweet.
"I'm getting excited
just writing about her,
and I know she'll be
the perfect pin-up."
It's me!
Not you!
That's not even funny, Ari.
Don't joke about it.
It's not you.
All the same, I do think
I'm gonna put you
on third shift for a while.
Third shift?!
Yes, it's safe here,
and you'll be going home
when the sun comes up.
That's bullshit, Bob.
Just until January.
For me.
Fine.
Ahem. What about me?
You're not his type.
I think you'll be fine, Mandy.
Okay! Bye!
"Bitter, yet somehow sweet."
Yeah, and that squeaky bitch
has the nerve to think
it could actually be her.
This does kind of sound
a lot like you.
Yeah.
Who do you think it is?
You think it's one of the
regulars?
I would think you'd be a little
more worried than you are.
Maybe one of Mandy's regulars.
One of the good-looking ones.
I can't believe you're taking
this so lightly.
This is life and death, Ari.
If I were you, I'd lock myself
in my apartment until next year!
Oh, no need.
I'll be locked in the fucking
diner until next year.
Bob put me on third shift until
they catch my...
secret admirer.
Secret admirer?
This is not a love letter.
(Whispering)
It's a death threat.
I get it.
You're just jealous.
Because I'm...
the real Miss December,
and you're just
the fake Miss August.
You have lost your mind.
I hate third shift.
I hate third shift.
I hate third shift.
Well, I love third shift.
You know why?
It's so... serene.
There are no customers, Bob.
I thought you hated customers,
Ari?
With a passion,
but I need their tips.
I can't survive
on $2.17 an hour.
Good point. But the 2:30 rush
should be coming in soon.
Why do you even keep this place
open overnight?
Because it's a diner, Ari.
By definition, diners should be
open 24 hours.
It's a pillar of the
neighbourhood.
When old ladies can't sleep at
night, where do they come?
The Aramingo.
When husbands get in fights
with their wives,
where do they flock?
The Aramingo.
When the salsa clubs
close at 2:00 a.m.,
where do the dancers come?
Let me guess...
Si. El Aramingo!
Yeah, it is the lone constant.
And no matter
how bad things get,
no matter how crap
the economy is,
you can always count on one
thing, Ari Anderson.
You can always get a warm,
delicious,
reasonably priced meal
at the Aramingo Diner.
What about New Year's?
Maybe you'd like to work New
Year's Eve and keep us open?
And miss your party?
It's the rave of the year!
Yes, it is. It is that.
(Laughing)
We've been known
to get a little crazy.
So, are you--
are you coming this year?
Of course. You know your
pigs in a blanket
are the only thing coaxing me
into another year of
self-loathing misery.
I knew you'd like them.
You wanna know the secret?
Not really?
Dollar store dogs.
Quarter chicken, quarter beef,
quarter pork, quarter mystery.
More fat equals more flavour.
More flavour equals more fun.
So, are you gonna be bringing a
date this year, Ari?
I brought a date last year.
Really?
Yeah, remember? He broke up
with me on your doorstep.
Thanks for opening old wounds.
Well, that's what cigarette
breath gets you.
But don't worry. With your
lovely makeup and wardrobe
and sunny disposition,
I'm sure you'll have no trouble
getting another date.
As a matter of fact,
I could put in a good word with
Byron for you, if you'd like.
He's been asking about you.
That is, if I survive
until then, of course.
Not funny, Ari.
Not funny.
What are you doing here so late?
I could ask you the same thing.
What did you do to get
put on graveyard?
I didn't do anything.
My boss here thinks
that it's safer,
since I may or may not be
the next victim
of the Calendar Girl Killer,
not that it matters,
since I have
no fucking customers,
and will probably
starve to death
before he gets
a chance to kill me.
Anything I can do?
Yeah, order some fucking food
for once,
so you can leave me
a decent tip.
Best cheesecake in the city.
Just coffee.
(Yawning)
That was impressive.
Sure you're gonna be able to
make it till morning.
Yeah. I used to pull
all-nighters in college.
By all accounts, I did not sleep
my entire junior year.
Well, if you like, I can
camp out and keep you company.
It's not like I have
a real job or anything.

I have bad news, Ari.
You should sit down for this.
No time, Bobbo.
People are hungry out there.
Ari...
Mandy was killed.
I know.
I'm taking her tables.
How can you be so cold?
This is for real, Ari.
She's dead.
And it's my fault.
I told her she would be fine.
No, you told her
she wouldn't be killed by the
Calendar Girl Killer,
and she wasn't.
It was a mugging gone awry.
These things happen every day.
What doesn't happen every day
is an opening of prime tables
that I already have my sleep
schedule dialled in for.
Bob?
No matter how uncertain
times may get,
or how many people get murdered,
you can always get
a warm, delicious meal
at the Aramingo Diner.
Bob.
We've both lost people
close to us.
But the best thing to do
is to not dwell on it.
You're right, Ari.
You're right.
Tables one through four, right?
And the counter.
Welcome to the Aramingo Diner,
my name is Ari.
I'll be your waitress
this morning.
Where's Mandy?
Is she sick.
Uh, she's dead.
Oh. All right.
Come on. Are you kidding?
No, seriously.
She was murdered.
My god...
Well, what happened?
I don't know. Stabbed, or shot.
Something like that.
She's definitely dead.
You gotta be kidding.
No.
So, can I start you out
with some coffee?
Yeah, I would like green tea,
with lemon and honey.
Serious?
Yeah, that's what I like.
Okay, what about
the rest of you?
Decaf.
Just tea.
Okay.
Decaf.
What a bunch of pussies.
What?
Fucking Bob.
Cheese.
Still on graveyard, I see?
Not for lack of trying.
No, I don't smoke.
Honestly, neither do I.
It's the only way I can get a
fucking break around here.
Really?
Yeah. I've been
fooling Bob for years.
He's gone as far as to buy me
patches and hypnotic tapes,
trying to get me to quit.
It's kinda sad, actually.
There was this one time that--
ah, never mind.
What?
Never mind.
Come on. You of all people
should know
you can't just start
a story and not finish it.
I can do whatever the fuck
I want to.
I've never finished a story.
All right, well,
how'd you graduate college
with a degree in writing then?
Short stories. One-acts.
Just nothing with your classic
"beginning-middle-end" thing.
Well, it's a wonder you've never
been published.
Forgive me if I've
never been in a place
where I wanted one of my
characters to end up.
Ari, very important--
I'm giving you the keys to the
kingdom, all right?
Gotta get on the hoppers
for a couple of minutes.
He'll come up the back walk-in.
Let him in.
Okay? You get it?
Use the patches, dummy.
Actually, I was just stopping by
to ask you something.
No.
I'm sorry?
I apologize for being curt,
but I don't subscribe to the
practice of mincing words.
I appreciate the honesty.
Why no?
It's a timing issue, really.
Your pieces are bold,
interesting, inspired.
The work last year would've made
you the darling of the city.
Right now, people want more than
just aesthetics.
Like?
Feeling. Agony. Passion.
Hunger. Raw emotion.
I have something.
I can't see "something."
I can't sell "something."
It's not quite finished.
Well, I suggest that you
expedite your progress.
Timing is everything.
(Phone vibrating)
Ari.
Hey, Jon, I have
a question to ask you.
Sure.
Do you happen to remember
what I wore on our first date?
Why are you asking?
I don't know, maybe I'm getting
a little sentimental.
Smiths T-shirt, plaid skirt,
black stud earrings.
Do you remember
what bar we went to?
Liberty's.
<i>That place on second, right?</i>
That's right.
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>
My date wanted to go somewhere
in that part of town tonight,
<i>and I remember they had the</i>
<i>best damn jalapeno poppers</i>
<i>I've ever had. Thanks again.</i>
June is as cliché as... cliché.
What? Okay,
how about May then?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. What do you
think about this place?
To eat?
Yeah.
Um, I don't know.
I was kind of looking forward to
the Continental.
So you know all this stuff about
my, and I know dick about you.
Fire away.
So, photography.
That's your thing?
Yeah. Mostly landscapes.
Trees and shit.
Yeah. Trees and shit.
This place has charm.
It has history.
History?
Yeah.
I mean, do you think it's
structurally sound?
No.
(Laughing)
But if it happens to
collapse in on itself,
I'll shield you from falling
debris with my umbrella.
How's that
sound?
Okay.
Deal?
Yeah, deal.
I can handle about
a shot glass of beer.
Chris!
Oh, hooray, Francis is here...
Hi. Francis.
Phil.
Nice to meet you.
Chris.
Phil.
Phil's a photographer.
Is that right?
I was a photography major myself
until I was a junior.
What's your main
subject matter?
Trees and shit.
(Laughing)
Did, uh... Did you tell her?
Tell me what?
Nah, I was gonna wait until--
Tell me what?
We're getting married!
And you weren't gonna tell me?
I was gonna tell you--
I'm your best friend, Chris.
You're supposed to
tell me everything.
Ah, fuck it.
I'm gonna throw you
the craziest rager
of a bachelor party
you've ever seen.
I am your best man, right?
Actually it's going to be
Francis' brother,
but only because we're having a
real small wedding party.
It's gonna be just family.
You're absolutely invited.
Plus one, of course.
This is total bullshit, Chris.
Ari, please.
Please what?
Please understand that I'm being
cut out of your life
one fucking milestone at a time.
Can't you just be happy for me
and stop acting
like a fucking child?
Christopher! Language!
Yeah, Christopher.
Aren't you supposed
to be happy for--
Shut the fuck up, Francis.
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?
Oh, god, don't worry about
defending your fiancée's honour.
We were just leaving.
Ah-- congratulations.
Are you okay?
I'm fine. Let's get drunk.
Uh, you forgot your bike.
How drunk are you?
Very.
I normally don't drink.
I think you need one more.
Goddammit.
(Hissing)
Morning.
Hi.
How you feeling?
Like death.
Can I get you anything?
Just coffee.
You know, this is really the
only thing I know about you.
What's that?
How you like your coffee.
Doughnut?
No thanks.
So...tell me something else
about yourself,
other than photography, coffee,
and your dislike of solid foods.
There's not much to tell.
I don't even know how much
longer I'm gonna be in town.
I mean... there's not
a lot of galleries
interesting in
landscapes of trees--
And shit, yeah.
You could do other
things for money.
You could be a janitor,
or work at a bookstore.
Waiter?
Sure, as long as you're happy.
Are you happy?
No.
I thought I was
getting there.
(Phone ringing)
Hey, Ari, about last night,
I just want to--
I'm sorry.
It's my fault.
I should've told you sooner.
It's okay. I understand.
I know this is what you wanted.
I'm happy for you.
Who's Phil?
He's a guy.
I saw that. I mean, how do you
know him? Where'd you meet him?
<i>Is he, like, a...</i>
What?
I just want to make sure
you're okay.
You can talk to him.
He's actually right here.
Here, can you talk
to Chris for me?
He thinks I've been date raped.
Uh, no I-- ah--
Um, I'm not a rapist.
No, I didn't say you were a
rapeman-- rapist-- raper.
Please just tell Ari that I'll
call her later.
You couldn't tell her,
could you?
You saw how upset she got
when we told her.
We both know she
shouldn't be there.
Do you want me to tell her?
Wait, sit down. Relax.
Coffee's almost ready.
Why? We could spend
the day together.
I don't have to be
at work until 8:00.
I'm... afraid to get
close to you.
That sounds like some bullshit.
It's not, it--
It's truth.
Take it as you have to.
So will I... see you again?
Definitely.
Rain cheque?
Whatever.
I'm not shaking your hand.
We're not army buddies.
A handshake? No sex?
He just passed out.
(Laughing)
I'm sorry.
Well, he did say
he doesn't drink.
And he never eats, so...
Right.
I just thought that--
Oh, my god,
stop thinking about him!
It was just a handshake.
Couldn't be that good.
I would, but if I do that,
I'll be forced to think about
Chris's fucking engagement.
I thought you said their days
were numbered.
Goes to show what I know.
Well, how did you think it was
gonna play out?
I don't know!
Whole idea makes me
fucking sick.
Well, I hate to say it, but we
all know it. You did have your--
Don't, Julie.
Just don't.
What you need,
is a girls' night.
Like spandex tube tops
and manicures?
No guys.
Forget about Chris.
Forget about Phil.
Definitely forget about Jon.
Just you and me.
We'll go out to Manayunk and
have some stupid guys
buy us $14 martinis
with gummy bears in them.
It'll be a blast,
just like college.
Okay. Girls' night.
Eee! Girls' night!

Morning, sir.
You're early.
I like that.
How was your holiday?
You talk way too much.
You know that?
Ha ha! Come on, man.
Lighten up.
I'm just jerking you
around, here.
Thank you for asking--
My holiday was fantastic.
I won a ton of dough on the
Detroit game,
and I banged my wife's sister,
which was satisfying
in more ways
than you can possibly imagine.
Have you ever handled an
arraignment before?
No, sir.
Well...
I was gonna give this to
Riddles, but he's not here,
and you are.
Look at me.
This is an open and close case.
Guy was found murdered in his
apartment last night.
Who finds the body?
The landlord.
The guy's got a ton
of back rent,
and the landlord, he's got a
record from here to New York.
All the pieces are there.
This guy's a flight risk.
I don't want that bail for less
than 100K, do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
You won't screw up.
I'm not gonna let you down.
If you do, it'll be
the last thing you do.
Mary?
(Banging on door)
Who is it?
Chris.
Can I come in?
Is everything okay?
Yeah, everything's fine.
Give me a minute.
Hey.
What's up?
What-- what time is it?
It's 10:00 a.m.
I thought you said I was
drinking too much.
You should sit down.
Jon was killed.
Like, by stabbing?
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.
I know how much
he meant to you.
Do they know who did it?
The detectives are saying it was
his landlord.
Jon owed a lot of back rent,
and the landlord had a record.
I'm not so sure, though.
You had said that Jon was
talking to you again.
Did I?
Was there anyone
that you know of,
that Jon may have
made enemies with?
Wanted him gone?
Anyone?
Yeah.
Who?
Byron...
Byron.
Did you kill Jon?
Gosh!
There are no customers.
Bob is passed out.
What-- what about that guy who
always pays you in buttons?
Byron's in jail now.
Did you kill Jon? Yes or no?
Yeah.
Why would you do that?
I was jealous, okay? I...
I thought you were gonna
pick him over me.
Mandy, though, that was for you.
You killed Mandy?
She was a bitch
with good customers.
They should've been
your customers.
Do you know how insane
that sounds, Phil?
Thought that's what you wanted?
Got something to show you.
Is this the first one?
That's the one.
I knew you were special from the
very first day I met you.
Ari, come on!
I wanna see 'em!
Aww! Look, there's Xanax.
There's my friend, Julie.
She's actually playing your
Miss August in a re-enactment.
I'm going by the set tomorrow,
you should actually
come with me.
This one's just Julie.
It's not what it looks like.
Is this Christmas?
This is Christmas!
You drugged me
and stalked Julie?
What the fuck?
She's Miss December?
Look, keep it down.
Find another girl.
Look, there's not enough time.
I have a whole process
that I go through.
She's already in
half the pictures,
so it just works out well.
Why can't it be her?
Because she's my friend.
Well, then you
should be honoured
that she's going to be
immortalized in my calendar.
Immortalized?
Don't flatter yourself.
Jon, Mandy... whatever.
But Julie is actually
a nice person.
She tips 20%.
She's even nice to old people.
Look, this is my art, Ari.
Why can't you understand that?
This calendar is something that
I've always wanted to do,
and it's taken a lot of time
and effort.
There is no time for
another Miss December.
All right, there's a planning,
and a process...
and if it's not her, then there
is no calendar,
and that is a whole year's worth
of work gone to waste.
Well, you should've thought of
that before you got lazy
and chose my friend because you
didn't want to look any harder.
Look, just because you've never
finished a story does not mean--
I'm sorry, okay?
Look, just hear me out.
Okay...
It's gonna be great.
I was planning on
taking her back here,
on New Year's Eve,
when you guys close,
and then I'm gonna
do the shoot in the diner,
with all the decorations.
It's gonna be
really cool.
On New Year's Eve?
Yeah.
Hell no!
You are gonna be with me
and Julie at Bob's party.
I am not going another
New Year's Eve
with no one to kiss
at midnight. Do you hear me?
I heard you.
Fine. No calendar.
I want to see
the look on your face
when I tell you that you're
not welcome at my wedding.
You're also not welcome
around my fiancée.
Did he say that?
I'm saying that,
and I really don't care how
close you two used to be,
because he's not
gonna be wasting
any more of his valuable time on
your childish escapades,
and if you so much as call him,
I'm gonna march
right back into this diner
and grab you
by the back of the--
(Screaming)
...on a stretcher,
and I know you don't have
adequate insurance
to pay for your hospital
expenses.
Can it be her?
Ew. No! Really?
Come on.
Stop it.
Oh... my... god.
He said he's in love with you?
Aah!
Oh, my god,
I'm so happy for you!
That's amazing! So when do I get
to meet this Phil of yours?
He's gonna be at Bob's party.
Hey!
All right, Judy.
Julie.
Yeah-- ooh!
ASSISTANT:
Keep those on.
Here's the-- here's the scene,
all right?
You just barely made it into
this dark warehouse,
with the Calendar Girl Killer
nipping at your heels. Right?
Then you're screaming
and running around.
Oh, it's gonna be amazing.
Very intense stuff.
So he just starts slashing and
stabbing at you,
trying to get to you.
Keeps missing you by a hair.
Just a hair!
And he catches the back of your
blouse, right?
And then your top flies off.
Terrifying.
So you get away, right? Then
he's still stabbing at you.
Then this time, he hooks onto
your belt. That pops off.
Next thing you know,
your skirt just falls away.
On the ground.
Huh? Huh?
This is gonna be amazing!
I know, right?
That's what I was saying!
That's what he was saying.
So you guys pick out something--
something that
really works the body,
and then I'll make sure
we get shots
of everything she tries on.
You do that. Come back to me.
The photos.
Give me 10 minutes
with the photos
and we'll figure it out,
all right?
All right, you girls.
We'll see you guys soon.
Okay. Right this way.
I like... this one.
Now, it shows a little muff,
but it's tasteful muff.

We'll talk to Ari, you and me.
We'll sort it out, okay?
It's gonna be all right.
No, I'm not going to do that.
So you're not sorry.
What do you think gives you the
right to tell my friend
what she can or can't do?
Because I'm going to
be your wife.
I'll be back before midnight.
We'll sort it out then.
Fancy.
Hey! Byron!
What? Did you open up a new
bed & breakfast or something?
This is nice.
No, Byron, this is my house.
Remember, you helped me move in.
And you've been here the last
eight years of parties.
I don't remember.
Hey! Hey, man!
It's good to see you.
Some people came around and
arrested me,
said I killed a guy.
I guess I didn't, though,
because they let me out.
My time in jail was nice,
though. I'm a Latin king now.
See you later, Bobbo.
Where can I get a fucking cup of
coffee in this place?
You were right. I will never
doubt you again.
I'm having a blast.
Yeah?
I'm getting another drink.
Ari? Anything?
No, thank you. Someone has to be
the responsible one.
I'm getting four of these in
you, and seeing what happens.
Okay. All right.
All right. Okay.
Ari, I really like him.
Yeah.
He's something else.
Chris!
Hello, Julie.
Did you miss me yet?
You know there's a lot of red
cups in this room?
I'd noticed.
A lot-- Oh!
Hey. Chris?
How you doing?
Never better.
Step outside?

I'm at my boss's house.
I have to keep up appearances.
I'll pass.
Sure.
Keep an eye on her.
Make sure she doesn't
disappear with Leonard.
Hey!
Cheers!
Francis told me
she stopped in the diner.
Yeah, whatever. It's fine.
I don't know what she said,
but just ignore it,
because she's getting all
"bridezilla" on me really early.
No, seriously, it's no big deal.
It's cool.
I don't think I've ever
seen you so content.
First time for everything.
He seems like a lot of fun.
But the real question is how
does his karaoke game

breaker, and you know it.

a job that doesn't leave you

What if there is

Leonard just started
his Vegas story.

at me as says,
"These $2 bills are

Which causes me to say,
"No, ma'am,
I suggest you look a little bit

She does this, and clearly sees
that these are obviously...
Julie!
Julie, wake up.
Aw, jeez. She's all
passed out, huh?
you gotta pour fucking piping
hot cup of coffee
Know what? I'm gonna hit up a
utility closet and get a funnel
and we're gonna tag-team
this problem.
Jesus fuckin' Christ.
Plus, Ari, I came out here to
have a cigarette with you.
You don't smoke.
Neither do you.
We got 20 minutes to New Years,
<i>and time is running out.</i>
<i>If there's something</i>
<i>on your list</i>
<i>you wanna get done</i>
<i>in this year,</i>
<i>you got, well, now</i>
<i>about 19 minutes to do it.</i>
<i>It's the time of the year when</i>
<i>everybody...</i>
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Thank you.
20 minutes.
20 minutes till the end of
good ol' two-zero-zero-niner.
You know what that means,
don't you?
You're done
third shift.
Year's not over yet, Bob.
I might not make it.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I had to put you
through all that.
It's just that,
I worry about you.
No shit.
Yes shit.
Wasn't that bad of a month,
actually.
Got some good material.
What do you mean by "material"?
Shit to write about.
Oh! Yeah.
I think I found
an ending that I like.
Ari Anderson, are you breaking
up with me on my front doorstep?
Can't be a waitress forever,
Bobbo.
No. I wouldn't want that either.
Come here.
I won't tell anyone.
Get over!
I'm proud of you.
I don't like her.
And what I like even less is you
being at her beck and call.
She's a lousy friend.
She's a burden, and how
do you think that looks
for you to be bailing her
out of jail
when you work for the
District Attorney?
I'm proud of you.
I gotta go to Dollar Land
and get more dogs.
I gotta keep the people happy.
Hold that.
Happy New Year!
Happy
New Year.
Now, after 71 agonizing days...
You remember this?
Family?
A house? Marriage?
You promised me
I was the only one.
Don't ruin this for me.
For us.

That's her.
It could be an emergency--
It's always an emergency.

Take whatever you want,

That was my dad's.
How do you feel about
third chances?
Phil's the Calendar Kill Girl!
He killed Jon and Byron and,
like, a dozen other people!
Oh, my God, it is an emergency.
He's gonna kill Julie next!
I'm on my way to the diner.
Ari, just stay at the party,
okay? Don't do anything stupid.
Just call the police.
MAN:
<i>Philadelphia Police.</i>
Someone's about to get killed at
the Aramingo Diner.
Send police right now!
The Armadillo Diner?
The Aramingo Diner!
Wait, start from the beginning.
Just fucking do it, asshole!

Julie. Julie!
Aahh!
Chris.
Glad you could make it.
You know,
I normally don't like
to wait until the last minute
on these things, but...
you gotta love the tension!
I mean, it's all about
the thrill of the game.
The cops will
be here any minute.
Thanks for the update!
I'd better get to work.
(Watch beeping)
What was that?
Happy New Year.
That's not possible.
I didn't finish it!
It's not done!
Yeah, well...
might as well get a jump
on January, right?
No!
You lied to me!
There's my girl.
Trust is the most important part
in a relationship.
I thought this is what
you liked about me.
I told you to stop,
and you agreed.
Oh, come on, Ari,
don't fool yourself.
If you really wanted the
Calendar Girl Killer caught,
you'd have turned me in
a long time ago,
but you didn't.
I kept going for you.
It was all for you.
That's not what I want anymore.
Well, then I want what you want.
I just want to make you happy.
I want you.
We can't always get
what we want.
Aah!
Chris!
Oh, don't look at me like that.
This is my art, Ari,
and I'm very good at it.
Aaahh!

Give me another chance.
Are you okay?
I'll live... I assume.
I can't believe
I got you into this.
I can.
No more, okay?
No more trouble,
no more bullshit.
Ari... I've had all that.
And it's just really
fucking boring.
Happy New Year.
