Milo, where are you?
<i>Previously on "Slasher".</i>
Oh, God.
<i>A series of bloody murders...</i>
<i>...two journalists, Dylan Bennett
and Alison Sutherland.</i>
Why don't we ask
The Executioner himself?
Please talk to me.
Let me interview you.
I mean, call me crazy, but
throwing yourself to the lions
does seem a little prideful.
You have no sins?
No, nothing.
<i>Ariel Peterson's
disappearance was big news,</i>
<i>but with no new leads</i>
<i>the story started
to die a slow death.</i>
<i>So...</i>
<i>I made sure it stayed live.</i>
<i>Benny Peterson...</i>
<i>All the facts pointed to him,
but there was no smoking gun.</i>
<i>So I provided one.</i>
You can't do this! No!
<i>She got in the car.</i>
Shit.
<i>Itsy bitsy spider...</i>
Don't stop singing, Ariel.
It's beautiful.
<i>You're like a totally
different person</i>
<i>when you're around your friends.</i>
You are, Larkwood.
You're mean,
and you're cold, and you act like
you don't care about anything.
Especially me.
No!
No, just stay there.
I don't want to see you right now.
Yeah, have fun
at your party, asshole!
Ah, looks like somebody
just yawned a big, bright,
chunky rainbow.
Looks like the Peterson girl.
You okay, hun?
Can you walk?
- I think so.
- Yeah?
All right, here's
what you're gonna do.
You're gonna go straight home,
you're gonna drink
a bucket of water,
and take two aspirin,
and jump into bed.
Not gonna die.
You'll just think you did.
Shouldn't we drive her home
or take her to emerg...?
Hold her hand for three hours,
until she sobers up?
<i>- Let her walk it off.</i>
Hey...
if you want me kept up all night,
June bug,
it's gonna be because of you.
She'll be fine.
She'll be fine.
No.
Wait!
Come back!
You're Ariel, right?
You been drinkin'?
No.
That's all right.
I'm off-duty.
<i>I don't care how many
shots of JÃ¤ger you did</i>
or with who.
I just wanna make sure
you get home safe and sound.
Go on. Get in.
I'll drive you home.
Thank you.
So where are all your friends?
At a party.
Why aren't you?
Ah!
Boy troubles, huh?
I got it.
How'd you know?
Well, for starters,
you've been crying.
<i>- Drank far too much.</i>
And you're wandering
around Waterbury at half past 11.
Oh, we just live off
of Greenwood.
Yeah, I figured you might
wanna sober up some.
Unless, of course, your parents
are cool with you drinking.
<i>- No.
- I didn't think so.</i>
I've been there, Ariel.
I had the girl of my dreams and...
...I lost her.
What happened?
Connie Renn was her name.
Smart, quiet...
Beautiful.
Different, you know?
Unique.
A lot like you.
That was...
That was 20 years ago.
Life just... life just goes on.
It's really easy
talking to you, Ariel.
You, too.
You, uh...
...you know I meant
what I said.
You remind me of Connie.
I'm-- I'm just
like your boyfriend.
I'm just a... a total... idiot.
- No! Don't say that.
You're like a hero.
Yeah?
You think I'm a hero?
Yeah.
Do you know why girls
date older guys?
It's because you mature
so much faster.
I mean, you just leave us
right in the dust.
I can just walk the rest
of the way home, if that's easier.
No, no, no. Come on.
It's okay.
- It's okay.
- Ariel.
- Please.
- Please, I just wanna go home!
- It's okay.
It's okay. Shh. Shh.
Please, just let me go
home now.
No! Please, no!
No!
- No!
- It's okay.
- No!
- All right!
No! No!
- Stop!
- No!
- It's okay!
- No!
- Stop.
- No!
- Shh. Shh.
- Please, help!
- Stay calm. Stay calm.
Stop!
No!
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.
- Come back here.
- Jake needs breakfast.
Jake is asleep.
I could do this all day.
Lying here with you.
It's like heaven.
I think this is good.
Imagine if we had
a real life together?
You...
me... and Jake.
And Nancy.
You guys have always
wanted kids.
Could be like this every day.
Gonna be late for work.
You know, when you talk
like this, Ariel...
All you do is make me
really upset.
Is Daddy mad at me?
No, honey, of course not.
Just go back to sleep.
Poor Alison, huh?
From the frying pan
into the fire.
Are you enjoying this, Dylan?
Half the town
is getting sliced and diced.
No. I'm not enjoying this.
Still.
You know, it's worked out
kinda well for you.
Alison's dead,
and you're in charge.
I'm not in charge.
Sarah, I'm just trying to keep
this thing a float here.
It's kinda sounding
like an accusation.
No.
No, a-- an accusation
would be me...
asking you where you were...
when Alison was murdered.
'Cause...
...you weren't here.
Right, a journalist
killing an entire town,
to put himself on the map.
It's a juicy story, isn't it?
You're unbelievable.
Well, you wasted no time
moving in.
Someone's gotta
hold down the fort.
Dylan...
this story is breaking... Big!
And I wanna talk next steps.
So does Megyn Kelly.
And <i>Dateline</i> and <i>48 Hours Mystery.</i>
Well, lucky for me,
I got in on the ground floor.
What are you doing tonight
for dinner?
Eating a sandwich, right here.
You can take an hour out
and have dinner with me,
like a civilized person.
Tell me the time and the place.
Well, there is only one place.
How's, um, how's seven?
Perfect.
Looking forward to it.
Hey.
Can I come in?
What do ya want?
Look, I'm not here to fight,
or upset you,
or make anything worse.
But I think I found something out
about Ariel.
Come on in.
Everything in this case
has led directly back
to Benny Peterson.
You see, not anymore, though.
Marjorie Travers gave an interview
to the <i>Bulletin,</i>
where she says that she saw Ariel
on Tecumseh Street at 11:30.
Which makes her the last person
to see Ariel alive.
Okay.
We now know that June and Trent
saw her seven minutes later
on Chariton Street.
Nah, that's impossible.
Chariton's like at least
a 20-minute walk away.
Exactly.
So either Ariel was
in two places at once,
or Majorie is lying...
about everything.
I saw Ariel where I saw her
and when I saw her.
What more do you need to know?
Benny Peterson was
at the Legion that night.
That's right around the corner
from where you said you saw Ariel.
Yeah, I know where the Legion is.
He left at 11:40 p.m.
And no one saw him again
until the next morning.
That's because he was busy raping
and murdering his daughter.
Well, we now know
that's impossible.
So I'm gonna ask you again,
Marjorie.
Are you sure... that's Ariel
that you saw that night?
I was havin' a smoke,
in front
of the White Onion Tavern.
Ariel Peterson walked by me.
I know it was 11:30 'cause...
Karaoke Night at the Onion
had just... let out.
Starts 9:30, goes two hours.
Unless my math is wrong.
That'd put it at 11:30 p.m.
Well, thank you very much
for your time, Marjorie.
Let's go.
You know,
that someone like you gets
to live and waste their life
is wrong on so many levels.
Sweetheart...
Your mother might've been
a whore,
but at least she was fun.
Uh, just...
Stay classy, Marjorie.
I saw Ariel walk by.
Blah, blah, blah.
She didn't see her.
She's unbelievable.
I know, it's upsetting.
Upsetting?
Cam, she was 15. Okay?
She was a child.
And I think how terrified
she must've been.
I know, but, honestly,
it's not your concern.
Sarah, you didn't even know Ariel.
I'm sorry?
Alison, Trent... June?
The Executioner targeted them.
Killed them because
of their association with this girl.
When I think about what
she must've gone through...
It almost makes me wonder
where The Executioner
is actually doing God's work.
What?
Marjorie's lying.
You know it, and I know it.
No.
Hey...
The other day...
Those things,
all that shit I said...
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Really, I'm sorry, too.
No.
No, you being here...
That's the one good thing
that's happened this summer.
Okay, so, what's this one called?
- A poodle!
- Good.
And... this one?
I like the poodle better.
Well, that wasn't the question,
little man.
Why do we have to
learn about this?
Why? You love clogs.
I do, but they're out there,
and we're in here.
Daddy!
Hey.
Hey, how are you, buddy?
You doing your lessons?
Yeah.
Fun fact:
Did you know
that poodle's don't shed,
they have to get a haircut?
I didn't know that.
You know what?
I got hit by a poodle once.
Right there, you can feel the--
Listen, buddy, I'm gonna
put this away, okay?
And then you can tell me
all about poodles later.
- Okay, can't wait.
- All right.
Yeah.
Earlier, I upset you...
and I'm sorry.
That's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's just that...
Jake started asking questions
about the world.
And...
I don't know what to tell him.
You know, he's lived his entire life
down here.
He's never played
with any other kids.
- He needs to go to a real school.
- And how exactly do we do that?
Ariel? Hm?
You just...
you open that door and...
And what do we tell everyone?
Whatever you want me to say,
I'll say it.
Whatever you want.
That's the thing, Ariel.
There's nothing we can say.
They're out of the fruit roll
thingies that Jake likes.
I'll get them the next time
I go to the store.
We're gonna die in here.
Oh, and, um,
if you want anything,
just write it down.
I got a mind like a sieve lately.
I can't remember anything.
Give me your keys.
All right. All right.
Here we are. Just...
take it easy.
Give me your keys!
All right. All right.
They're in my pocket, okay?
Just take it easy.
Jake.
Go stand by the door.
Mommy?
Honey, just do what I say.
You really think you're gonna have
enough time to get away, Ariel? Huh?
Where you gonna 90?
Who you gonna stay with, Ariel?
- Daddy!
Ariel!
Okay. Okay, come on.
Just keep running, baby.
Ariel!
No.
No!
Ariel!
Jake.
Daddy!
Jake!
Hey!
Let him go!
Let him go!
Get downstairs.
I won't.
Hey, buddy.
Wow.
Wow.
You're getting so big.
You're getting too big...
You're getting too big...
for your Dad to lug around.
What are you doing?
I'm not going to jail, Ariel.
- I'd rather die.
- No, Iain. Please, just stop.
And if I die...
Iain, Iain, Iain, stop!
- Get downstairs now!
- Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.
Let him go. Let him go.
Jake. Jake, it's okay.
Please!
Come on, buddy.
Go on downstairs.
Help us! Please!
Help us! Please!
Please!
Help us!
- Come on!
- Help us!
Help us!
Look, all I did was ask a witness
a few questions.
Without floating it by me first!
Yeah, well I tried.
And you weren't here. And you
weren't answering your phone.
Well, I would've said no.
What did Marjorie say?
Did you come up with anything new?
No.
The same old bullshit.
But this time her facts
don't line up.
And we tried pressing her.
We?
Jesus Christ, Cam, you just
buried your wife a week ago.
You're gonna wanna watch
what you're saying, sir.
And you're gonna wanna stop
thinking with your dick
and start thinking like a cop!
And until you can,
I want you to go home!
Look, whoever took Ariel
is a target now.
The same way June was.
That's my concern!
I want you to go home.
I want you to go home, Cam! Now!
Sir.
What are you gonna have?
Well, it's a toss up between
the Osso Bucco potato stack
and the Chinese chicken salad
with Mandarin staples.
Welcome to 1996.
Cheers.
To what?
The biggest story
since Casey Anthony.
Yeah, well, I'm not sure everyone
shares your enthusiasm.
Okay.
I think there's been a bit
of a misunderstanding.
No.
No misunderstanding.
You chose Alison over me.
But then she got her head
deep-fried.
Okay.
So, then,
how do I make it better?
What are you offering?
What do you want?
More money?
Done.
Airtime?
You'll be my go-to guy
on this case.
We can talk about bringing you in
on a permanent basis.
Why don't you come by my hotel?
We'll order a bottle.
- Do a little career planning.
- A book deal.
I'm sorry. What?
A book deal.
True crime.
All of the killings
started 30 years ago.
- I'm not a publisher, Dylan.
- You've published four books.
And you didn't write any of 'em.
You ready to order?
'Cause I know what I want.
Sarah. This is unexpected.
You're not my father.
You may think you are or you may
wanna think you are, but you're not.
Sarah, it's not a matter
of thinking.
You know, if you honestly think
I'm gonna start spending
every Father's Day with you,
you're insane.
You are my daughter.
No.
No, it's impossible.
And this...
This is not healthy.
- Can we talk about this?
- Good-bye, Tom.
Sarah, please.
Hold on.
Oh!
Hey!
In the mood for some company?
Get you a drink?
Cheers.
This job's gonna be
the death of you.
Yeah.
What's this?
Oh!
That's nothin'.
Cut myself shaving.
With a machete?
I, uh...
I hear Cam
paid you a visit today.
Oh.
Him and that Bennett girl.
Yeah, doesn't she think
she's all that.
Yeah.
Pretty thing, though.
Her mother was, too.
That's why we hated each other.
Hm.
What did you tell 'em?
What I've always told anyone...
who's asked about that night.
Don't worry. It's okay.
Things can get complicated,
Marjorie.
You got caught in a lie.
I saw what I saw.
I stick to my story.
Yeah, well, they're gonna be looking
for inconsistencies in your story,
and there gonna try
and trick you.
They?
I mean, it's your investigation,
right?
May not stay that way.
Well, don't worry,
because you know what?
I am a very, very good liar.
And I'm a lot smarter than I look.
What was Ariel wearing that night?
I-- I don't know.
What was she wearing?
Really?
You remember what time
Karaoke was over,
but you don't remember that?
Which way was she walking?
North or South?
Or was she running?
She probably was running because
she ended up on Chariton Street
seven minutes later.
Oh. Look. Look. Just...
Just tell me what you
want me to say...
and I'll say it!
I'll say it.
Okay.
I got you a present.
I love presents.
I nicked that off some asshole.
Caught him with his pants down
at the cruising spot
at the brickworks.
Is it good?
Only the best for you, baby.
Oh.
Oh.
Aw, shit, it's amazing.
Oh!
You're so good to me.
Better than all the other...
people in this shithole.
That's a good thing, girl.
I...
Iain.
It's...
It's hella...
It's really strong.
Did you?
Iain?
What did you do?
What have you done?
Hey, preacher.
Done with that?
Thanks.
Please give that back.
A little light reading, huh?
What is it today?
Hand it back... now!
Blah, blah, blah.
Marjorie Travers
has been shooting smack
since I was in little league.
I say we run the syringe for prints
and do a sweep of the room.
Even long-time users
make mistakes, Cam.
She probably got a hot load.
Yeah.
Maybe that's what this is.
Maybe it isn't.
And you're positive
it's Marjorie Travers?
<i>- Mm-hm.</i>
- 100?
<i>Yeah, we got the confirmation.</i>
<i>It's definitely her.</i>
Yep, okay. Thank you.
They're saying it's an overdose.
How convenient.
<i>- And you think it's a...</i>
- Of course.
Put you on the record?
On the record?
You're the last person
to see Marjorie alive.
The police are saying one thing,
you're saying another.
I'm sorry...
Are you asking if you can
interview me?
Sarah, listen to me.
There's something going on here.
And it's all tied back to Ariel.
Now, if one person reads this
and remembers something,
the night that Ariel went missing,
we could crack this case.
Dylan, a woman I saw
this afternoon
is lying dead in a motel room
because Cam and I
got too close to something.
That's my point.
And instead of asking if I'm okay,
you ask if you can interview me.
Fine!
No interview.
How insensitive of me
to try to help you find
a missing girl, right?
Oh, great!
Now I'm the bad guy.
You're classic.
What the hell are you doing
out here all alone?
This time of night?
Just getting some air.
Come on.
I insist. Get in.
Fine.
Sorry my stuff's in the front.
You, uh... mind jumping
in the back?
So what were you doing
out there?
I don't know.
You and Cam,
your optimism is admirable.
Ariel's been missing
for a few years now.
This isn't the first time
I've had to tell you, Sarah.
This is police business, I know.
So please, just let it go.
All right?
Can I be blunt?
Oh, I think you and I
are well past blunt.
This entire investigation
is based on lies.
Alison Sutherland lied,
Marjorie Travers.
So, what, you think
this is some big conspiracy?
Connect the dots.
I tell you what.
Why don't you connect them
for me?
Okay.
Ariel Peterson walked home
from a party.
By herself.
She gets into a car
on Chariton Street,
and that's the last time
anyone ever saw her.
Those are the facts.
Okay.
Now for the lies.
Alison Sutherland hacks
into Benny Peterson's account
and writes fake
but incriminating e-mails
that make it look like
he murdered his daughter.
Then...
Marjorie Travers corroborates
those e-mails
by flat out lying
about where Ariel Peterson
was that night.
And then, today, Marjorie Travers
conveniently overdoses.
Now, I'm not the police,
obviously, but...
You know?
It sounds to me like someone
got to Marjorie first.
Nasty women really pull the wool
over your eyes.
That's really easy to say
in hindsight.
Oh, yeah, because cops
never pick or choose evidence
to build a case.
You know, this has worked out
really well for you.
Alison and Marjorie are dead,
and you...
I, what, Sarah?
Now it's time for me to be blunt.
You're an idiot.
Not your hypothesis.
<i>Oh, no.</i>
You're dead on.
You're an idiot
for getting in this car.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Take your cell phone...
and drop it out the window.

Do it.
Now!
That's a good girl.
Where are you taking me?
What if someone saw me
get into your car?
I gave you a ride home.
I dropped you off,
I saw you walk in,
close the door, lock it.
I had no idea The Executioner
was inside waiting for you.
You know the punishment
for lust
is being smothered in fire
and brimstone?
But what's the punishment...
for pride?
Come on now, Sarah.
It's not like you
to get tongue tied.
What's the punishment?
- Being broken on the wheel.
- On the wheel, yeah.
Coming back to the town your parents
were murdered in,
moving into the same house,
trying to outsmart the police,
going toe to toe with a killer...
That sounds like pride to me,
Sarah.
No.
No, it's not Executioner's MO.
Well, I really don't give a shit.
I'm the chief investigator.
- Cam will--
- Cam will nothing.
Cam's my bitch.
<i>- Come on.
- No!</i>
- Shut up! Shut up!
- No!
God!
- Shut up! Shut up!
Or I will punch every tooth
out of your mouth.
No!
No!
No! Help!
I was not...
...a murderer, Sarah!
No!
Not until you made me one!
Shu-- shut up!
- Shut up.
- No!
No!
Shut up! Shut up.
Sarah!
There's nowhere to run, Sarah!
You hear me?
You're not gonna get away!
<i>Sarah!</i>
Sarah!
Stop! Stop! Please! Please!
Stop! Help me!
Stop! Please!
Stop! Stop!
What the hell are you doing?
Help me, please!
He's trying to kill me!
<i>- Get in! Hurry!</i>
Who is he?
Fuck!
She said that...
you made him kill her.
He said...
He wasn't a murderer
until I turned him into someone.
Or something... I don't know.
Just...
No, Sarah.
That-- that might actually be
a good thing.
It might mean that...
that Ariel isn't dead.
Maybe he didn't kill her
when he snatched her up.
He will now.
He was... he's desperate.
Sarah, I need to go.
No.
No, no, no.
Look, I have cops
all over this hospital.
Cam.
Please. Please don't leave me.
Okay.
I promise you.
That bastard will never get
within five feet of you again.
Do you hear me?
Ariel, wake up.
What? Why? What time is it?
I'm sorry.
Jake.
Please let us go.
No!
Iain, please, just let us go!
Iain!
Just let us go,
and we won't tell anyone!
We'll never tell anyone!
Please, Iain!
They already know!
<i>The punishment for lust...</i>
is fire and brimstone.
It's fire and brimstone,
and being burned alive!
What are you talking about?
Ariel, I've sinned.
I've sinned...
I have to pay
for what I've done!
No!
Please, Iain!
Iain, Iain, Iain!
Iain, listen!
Listen, I can die, okay?
I'm ready.
We can die together.
But Jake's just a little kid!
He's just a little kid!
Please! Iain!
Iain!
It's Cam!
We need to talk.
Open up!
Cam!
Is everything okay?
Did something happen?
Nancy, you need to tell us
where your husband is.
Now!
I-- I don't like your tone,
Cameron.
You don't like my tone?
Nancy...
You don't like my tone, then
answer my goddamn question!
Where's your husband?
Cam!
Nancy.
Hi Nancy, I'm Sarah.
Sorry, everyone's
just a little bit on edge.
We need your help, okay?
There's-- there's a girl in danger.
Because of Iain?
That's ridiculous.
- I'm sorry, Iain's not like that.
- No, no, no.
Of course not.
In fact, we think he might be
protecting her, we just...
just need to know
where they are.
Iain's business
is his own business.
Yeah, no, I know but...
This is so important, Nancy.
Do you ever watch
those home shows on TV?
You know, the ones
where the wives get to design
their new house,
and their husbands...
Well, the husbands
get something called a...
a man cave.
Isn't that a hoot?
A man cave?
You know, a place where...
boys can be boys,
no girls allowed.
Yeah, yeah. Well...
Does Iain... have a man cave?
Yes.
But I don't go there
because I'm not allowed.
We just want to help him,
Nancy.
Vaughn?
It's Cam.
Come on out.
We've got you surrounded.
Ariel?
You can let go, Ariel.
Your son will be okay.
I'm just going to examine him.
He's safe now.
Ariel?
<i>- You...
- Mom.</i>
I love you!
Mom!
Sarah.
- Hey.
Take it easy.
Take it easy!
Did they call you?
No.
I came myself.
How you feeling?
How am I feeling?
You came to see me.
Yeah.
Had a lot of time to think.
Put things into perspective and...
What?
I don't have enough family left
to pick and choose. So...
If we're gonna do this...
there's gonna be
some ground rules.
Anything.
No more lies.
No more lies.
I promise.
What do you want to know?
I want to know why you killed my...
my mother and her husband.
I want you to tell me the truth.
I want you to tell me everything.
Every detail.
From the beginning.
No.
Help! Help!
Oh, no!
Somebody, help me!
Help me!
Someone, help me!
Help me!
Help me!
No!
Somebody...
...help me!
Help me!
