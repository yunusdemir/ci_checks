[ Baby Crying ]
[ Shouting In Spanish ]
The harder you work,
the more money you make!
Come on! What's holding
you up? [ Spanish ]
* I walked 47 miles
of barbed wire *
* Use a cobra snake
for a necktie *
* Got a brand-new house
on the roadside *
* It's made from
rattlesnake hide *
* Got a brand-new chimney
made on top *
* Made out of
a human skull *
* Oh, now, come on, take

* Who do you love? *
* Who do you love? *
* Who do you love? *

Keep it going!
Keep it going!
[ Shouting In Spanish ]
Come on, we're wasting money!
We're wasting money!
"Don't you touch me,"
I says.
"I'm tired of being
hit by men already. "
So then I punched him.
When he hit the floor,
I thought he was dead.
I says, "If you don't like it,
you can lam it. "
So he lammed it.
Who needs fruit?
Fruit.
He told him to lick it.
Richie?
Bob?
Bob!
¡M'ijo! ¡M'ijo!
Hey, Richie, you taking
a break already?
So, Mr. Big Shot,
you finally showed up, eh?
I'm lucky I even
found this place.
Rosie...
this is
my brother Bob.
Why did you
wait a year to join us?
Come on!
Ha ha ha!
Bob, watch it!
My guitar, man.
I didn't know
that piece ofjunk...
was so important
to you.
Are you kidding?
I even sleep with it.
Come on!
Jersey Joe!
Jersey Joe!
Boom! Bow! Pow! Bam!
Joe Louis!
Rocky Mar-
Ow! Ow!
Ah!
Are you okay?
Can you move it?
You all right?
Ohh!
Ahh!
You've grown, cabrón!
You're a big sucker
for 16!
You miss me?
No.
You should have.
What was it like inside?
The joint is the joint.
Why didn't you come home
after you got out?
We haven't had a home
since Steve died.
Don't be such
a dreamer, man.
My dreams are
pure rock 'n' roll.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
[ Baby Crying ]
Go wash your hands
for dinner.
Okay, Mama.
Ha ha ha!
Gino!
You little pigs!
I'm going to tell
your mothers on you!
Peoow!
You tell 'em, Rosie!
Mom, what the hell
are you doing here?
I came to work.
I came to take you
out of this dump.
Not before
we make some money.
Ma.
I mean honest money.
Hey! I've been working.
Why can't you
believe me for once?
Mom...
what's going on?
We're getting out
of this shit-hole tomorrow.
Okay, m'ijo.
Okay.
Oh, don't.
Oh.
Oh...
Oh, please.
Oh.
Oh, tell me
you love me.
Uh!
Ahh.
Ahh.
Why didn't you tell me
this was your first time?
You didn't ask.
You coming, Richie?
Nah. I think I'll
wait up a while.
You're really something,
you know that?
Say, Richie!
What's up, man?
I should ask you.
Aw... hey...
Wait a minute, man.
Did I horn in on
something between-
Just forget it.
I thought
you'd changed.
[ Horn Honks ]
I'm going to
miss you.
Come on, huh?
Rosie.
Come stay with us
sometime.
Bob got us a big house
in Pacoima.
You're gonna
be late for work.
My dad wouldn't
like it.
Come on, let's go!
I love you, m'ija.
Bye, Connie.
Good-bye, m'ija.
Richie...
Bye, Rosie.

Richie,

Your breakfast is on the table.
I'm off to work.
And don't
ditch school today.
Thanks, Mom.
Rosie, the baby's
with the girls.
See you tonight.
Morning, Rosie.
Morning, girls.
Hi-o! Hi-o!
Bob come in last night?
He doesn't spend much time
at home, does he?
You do.
Yeah, well...
I'm me.
[ Bell Rings ]
Quiet!
Class is in session.
Sit there,
Miss Ludwig.
Now, take out your history
books, chapter seven.
Who is the blonde?
I don't know,
but I think I'm in love.
Yeah? Well, forget it.
She's way above
your class, High Tone.
You just concentrate
on that audition tonight.
[ Bell Rings ]
Hi.
Hi.
They call me
High Tone. You?
Donna.
Mind if I walk
with you, Donna?
Sure.
Uh...
I mean,
no, I don't mind.
Donna. That's
a nice name.
Thanks.
On second thought,
call me Richie.
Uh...
Oh.
This is my class.
Um...
where's yours?
It's in the gym.
I got P.E.
[ Bell Rings ]
You're late.
Yeah.
Well, uh...
bye.
Donna.
Bye... High Tone.
[ Whistles ]
Party time!
Say, Ed!
You want to buy a kilo?
¡Órale!
You did it, carnalito!
By the sweat
of my balls.
You did it!
Mamacita.
[ Horn Honks ]
All right, all right.
Come here.
Richie, I want you
to meet Rudy.
He's the leader
of the Silhouettes.
Yeah, well, look,
Valenzuela.
Chino keeps telling me
you're a real hotshot.
So...
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's that?
It's my amp.
Looks like something
somebody threw away.
Yeah, well,
it's mine now.
So don't worry
about it.
* Well, it's Saturday night *
* And I just got paid *
* Fool about my money,
don't try to save *
* My heart says,
"Go, go, have a good time" *

[ Laughter ]
No lie, dude!
I mean, the pendejo
was smoking weed.
He was smoking
milkweed, man!
I've got it bad.
Rosie,
take a hit, man!
Put a little mota
in our love life.
Baby, I need
some action tonight.
Ohh!
Come on, baby.
Rosie, come here, babe.
I was only joking.
Ha ha ha!
Rosie, come on,
open the door.
Just go away.
You know what?
Let's get going.
And go where?
Home.
Other people sleep,
you know.
You don't have to split, man.
Rosie, we're leaving!
I'm serious. Stick around.
Rosie will be out in a second.
Hey, Rosie, come on out!
Hassle it out
with your old lady.
No, no, no, no.
I know what's happening.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
All right?
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Good night, Bob.
Come on, Rosie.
Open the door.
I said open the door,
goddamn it!
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Open the goddamn door!
Leave me alone!
Just go away.
Get yourself drunk.
Okay, babe,
you asked for it.
You asked for it.
Our first gig's
next Friday night.
Let me see if you're
ready by then.
Right.
[ Sobbing ]
Rosie, are you okay?
[ Bob ]
Richie, what do you want?
Come here, Rosie.
Nothing.
Sorry, my mistake.
No, Bob,
it's no use no more.
What?
Don't you ever
get enough?
Is this all
you want me for?
Hey.
Mom?
Mom.
What is it?
I made it.
I'm in the Silhouettes.
Really, m'ijo?
Oh, Richie,
that's wonderful.
That's wonderful.
Who's the Silhouettes?
This is not
like I expected.
You are not like
I expected.
I don't have a life here!
You're always gone.
Do you think
I like being here alone?
Look, Rosie, you're
not my wife, all right?
Stop being
such a drag.
What the shit's
eating you anyway?
I'm pregnant.
Aren't you going to
say anything?
Well, what's there
to say?
It's not my first...
or my last.
You son of a bitch!
Dios.
What's going on
in there?
Get out!
Bitch! You bitch!
Is it my fault
you got pregnant?
Who else's?
Richie, don't.
It's none
of your business.
But I-
You son of a bitch!
I am not your puta!
Do you always carry
a guitar, Richie?
Uh-huh.
It's my future.
Pretty sure of yourself,
aren't you?
Yeah, aren't you?
I'm the new kid
on the block.
Poor little rich girl.
I'm not rich.
Right.
That's my dad.
This is the kind of place
I want for my mom.
Hi, Daddy.
Um...
Yeah.
Yeah, I got to go.
Listen, Donna.
I'm playing
at a garage party tonight.
Would you like
to come?
Garage party?
Yeah.
It's my big debut.
It'll be a real gas, kitten.
Please, come.
Okay.
Um... I'll have to
meet you there.
Okay. I wrote down
the address,
in case.
Yeah.
Uh, okay.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Hi, Daddy.
Who's the big kid?
Just a friend.
Hmm.
What is he, Italian?
Come on, babe.
Let's go.
Okay, I'm coming.
* Fine, fine, fine *
* Please be mine *
* Charlena *
* Oh, Charlena *
* Oh, Charlena *
Mom, look at Richie.
I see him.
* Charlena *
* Charlena,
don't you know I care? *
* Fine, fine, fine *
* Please be mine *
* Charlena *
Take it away, Joe.
* Charlena *
* Don't you know I care? *
* Charlena *
* Don't you know I love you? *
* Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ho *
* Aah **
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh *
* Good night, my love *
* Pleasant dreams *
* Sleep tight, my love *
* May tomorrow be *
* Sunny and bright *
Mama, when's Richie
gonna sing?
Pretty soon. Now, stop
asking me, okay, Connie?
We wish to thank each and every one
of you for attending our dance tonight.
I sincerely hope...
you had an evening
to remember.
So until next time, speaking
for myself, Rudy Castro,
and the guys in the band,
we are the Silhouettes
bidding you a good night.
* Good night **
[ Applause ]
Isn't Rudy a cool cat?
Good night, Richie!
What do they mean
not letting you sing, Richie?
Who do they want, Elvis?
It's no big deal, Mom.
I'll make them
come around.
They don't know who the hell
they're dealing with.
My granddaddy was a
full-blooded Yaqui Indian.
Aah!
What's the matter,
bad dreams?
I'm sorry, carnal.
I didn't mean
to wake you up,
but I just need
a place to crash, man.
No, man, here. Come on.
Get some rest.
Now, Brother.
You better keep your ass
to the wall...
because I'm so messed up,
I may take you for Rosie.
I'm sorry.
Okay, I'm sorry.
Where did you get
this picture of Steve?
Mom gave it to me
right after the funeral.
Man, I wish
I could've been there.
Hell, he was your dad,
anyway, not mine.
Ah.
Don't forget to turn out
the light, okay?
Good night.
Hey, Richie?
Yeah.
You been laid yet?
Oh, man.
I'm serious.
I know what your problem is.
It's sperm pressure.
It's scientific.
You got hard-ons.
You got nightmares.
Shut up
and go to sleep.
A kid your age needs
an authority figure around.
Believe me. I know.
I tried to go, Richie.
Honestly.
You don't
have to apologize.
My dad wouldn't let me
out of the house.
Honest to God?
Honest.
Honest.
I really wanted
to be there.
Woo! Cowboy palace!
I can't do it, honey.
Richie's a minor.
He's going to be singing,
not drinking.
Rock 'n' roll
to a bunch of cowboys.
My husband Steve drank
himself to death here.
Don't you think you owe
his boy something?
I'm gonna need a drummer.
Screw the Silhouettes.
I'll keep the beat.
What are you
going to play?
Boney Maroni.
Boney Maroni?
To these shit stompers?
[ Country Music Playing ]
Howard. Howard,
they're here.
Okay, cut the jukebox.
Plug in, guy.
Testing, 1, 2, 3.
Sure good
to see you folks.
Everybody having fun?
Turn
the jukebox on!
One of our local boys is making...
his professional debut
here tonight.
Let's give a big round
of applause...
for Ricky Ricardo Valenzuela!
Yay!
Whoo! Whoo!
Howdy.
You're just a baby,
ain't you?
Here's one
out of Lubbock, Texas.

* Da da da da **
Man, we were rockin'!
We were really rollin'!
Didn't I tell you?
You don't need
no band.
You just play with a
drummer, me, for instance.
Oh!
Talking about
making money!
I'm talking
about making music.
My music,
that's all I care about.
Richie, m'ijo.
What you need
is exposure.
A big place where you
can sell a lot of tickets.
You want to
be my manager?
Sure! I can get
the American Legion Hall.
Steve was a veteran.
You don't think I can?
Just for that,
you can be my flunky.
Anybody but Bob, okay?
What does that mean?
Just take care of Rosie.
Rosie?
Yeah.
Try staying home.
Listen, punk!
I don't need your-
Stop it.
Richie, don't be
so high tone.
Bob, you're
your brother's keeper.
Morning,
Connie, Richie.
Morning.
You missed
a great show last night.
Richie was wonderful.
Really? I'm not surprised.
I'm flying this coop.
Catch you all later.
I'm late for work.
What did I do
with my purse?
Flying the coop.
That's it!
Richard Valenzuela
and his flying guitar.
What do you think, guys?
This is beautiful.
We can raise the roof
off this joint.
They wouldn't even
let us into this place.
My mom set it up.
Since when is your mama
running this band?
We need all the breaks
we can get, right?
Richie's right, man.
I decide what's best
for the Silhouettes,
and this ain't it.
Let's beat it.
What's his problem?
Are you guys
coming or what?
I guess it's what.
What's going on?
Show business, m'ijo.
Show business.
Show business?
These look
like shit.
A monkey can draw
better than this.
Oh, yeah?
Should've kept
my mouth shut.
Every wall!
Every liquor store!
Every telephone pole in town!
Hit 'em all! All right, now!
Richard Valenzuela
and his flying guitar.

Lelo and Ernestine, hang up some
of that crepe paper across here.
Those chairs don't
go there, Phillipe.
They don't go there.
You are looking
really handsome, Richie.
The girls are gonna
go crazy over you.
There's only one girl
I care about.
Who's that?
Nobody you'd know.
Is everything
in order?
Perfect.
Thanks, Rosie.
We're gonna
pack the place, Mom.
I hope so.
We paid for this place
with our rent money.
One of these days, I'm gonna
buy you your dream house.
Tell me about it.
Where is Bob?
Lelo!
* Hey, hey,

* Let's just go on and on *
* Voodoo, doo, doo, darlin' *

No.
Did you look?
No.
* Whoo whoo **
He's pretty good, huh?
He's great.
What will you have?
Can I have a Coke?
All right.
Here's a little number.
This little number...
for the criminal element
here tonight.
You know who you are.
1, 2, 3!
* I was walkin'
down the street *
* Mindin' my own affair *
* When two policemen *
* Grabbed me unaware *
* They says,
"Your name Henry?" *
* And I says, "Why, sho"' *
* They says, "You're the boy
I've been lookin' for" *
* Yeah, I was framed *
* Well, I was blamed *
* Framed, framed, framed *
Look at my Richie,
shining like a star.
Hey!
Look at Bob.
* They took me
in the lineup *
* And let those
bright lights shine *
You're drunk, Bob.
Give me that bottle.
You're drunk.
* I knew I was the victim
of someone's evil plan *
* When the stool pigeon
walked in and said *
* "There's your man" *
* I was framed *
Ah ha ha!
Yeah, all right.
Yeah, Richie!
* Do nothin' wrong *
* But I always
get blamed **
Hit it.
That's my brother!
Hey!
Asshole!
Aah!
Bob!
Stop it!
Richie, no!
Richie.
Why, Bob?
How could you
do this to Richie?
To Richie?
I did this to me, okay?
That's my Bob. Always
thinking of others first.
Shut your mouth!
Don't take it out
on Rosie, okay?
Richie,
you don't understand, man.
You don't understand
a goddamn thing!
What do you think,
the whole fuckin' world
revolves around you?
* This I swear *
* Is true *
[ Horn Honks ]
Is this where you live?
No.
I live, uh,
down the street.
I'll take you home.
Why don't we
just go for a drive?
Okay, you drive.
* Oh, my darling... **
Well, what
do you think?
Not bad,
for a birthday
present.
You say
you're not rich?
My dad sells cars.
Can I help it
if he knows his business?
He just didn't want me
walking home anymore.
Because of me?
How come
you've been avoiding me?
Was it that blowout
at the dance?
Don't be silly.
Then what's
the problem?
My dad.
Does this mean I can't ask you
on a regular date?
Why don't you ask me?
I got my own wheels now.
Who cares
what my father thinks?
[ Whistles ]
Whoo!
Whoa!
Ooh!
Get your ass in gear,
Morales.
We still got a lot of places to stop at.
Hey, look at this.
It's Woody Woodpecker
and Buzz Buzzard.
This is the real stuff.
They make cartoons
out of these things.
Can it, jerk-off.
It's kiddy stuff.
Finders, keepers.
¡Basura!
Eat it! Eat it!
Yes?
Buenos días, señora.
¿Aquí vive
Richard Valenzuela?
Yeah, he lives here.
Why?
* This old man *
* He played six *
* He played knickknack
on a stick *
* With a knickknack
paddiwack *
* Give a dog a bone *
* This old man
came a-rollin' home *
* All right **
[ Applause ]
Happy birthday, m'ija.
That was good.
Richie, this man
wants to talk to you.
Hi, Richie.
My name's Bob Keene.
I'm president of Del-Fi
Records in Hollywood.
¿Podemos hablar?
I don't speak Spanish.
But we can
speak business.
Look, let me just say...
that I really dig your music,
and I'd like to record it.
What do you say?
Welcome
to Del-Fi Records.
I work out of the basement.
This is your
recording studio?
The Ampex is good.
The mikes are excellent.
What more do you need?
Relax, Richie.
This is just for starters.
Now,
I thought we'd start off easy-
Play a few riffs,
move on to a couple vocals.
When you're ready,
we'll record.
What do you mean,
today?
What about my band?
Frankly, Richie,
I can't use them.
Is that a problem?
Yeah.
They're my buddies.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Wait, Richie.
Wait a minute, man.
I understand
about friendship.
Not everybody gets a shot
at the brass ring.
You're going to have to ask
yourself what's more important,
your friends
or your music.
My family.
* You're mine *
* And we belong together *
* Yes, we belong together *
* For eternity *
* You're mine *
* Your lips belong to me *
* Yes, they belong
to only me *
* For eternity *
Bob?
Is that you?
Come here.
Come here.
Look at that.
Hey!
Did you trace this
or what?
Trace, hell.
This is freehand.
Look at this.
Art contest.
$500 in prizes.
Think I should enter it?
Yeah, man.
Go for broke.
* You're mine, my baby *
* And you'll always be *
* I swear
by everything I own *
* You'll always *
* Always be mine *
Rosie!
* You're mine *
* And we belong together *
* Yes, we belong together *
* For eternity *
* Etern... *
* Ternity **
Fantastic.
Aah!
I wasn't really there
when it happened,
but in the dream,
it's like I am.
My best friend got killed,
got crushed by one
of those falling planes.
Where were you that day?
My grandfather's funeral.
I guess his death
saved my life, huh?
Thank you.
My mom says it means...
I was saved for something
really special.
Know what it is?
Rock 'n' roll.
Harrr!
Yeah,
I'm gonna be a star,
and stars don't fall out
of the sky, do they?
You think I'm gonna dump garbage
for the rest of my life?
How are you gonna
support the baby,
drawing
Woody Woodpecker?
I don't want that here.
You don't respect
any shit I do.
What about
respect for me?
I almost have to rape her
just to have sex.
To her, it's dirty.
Look, Bob.
It's cool if you
move in with me,
but what about
when the baby comes?
Hey, hey.
My old man wasn't around
when I was born.
Why should I be?
Richie!
Figure it out, man.
Bob Keene called me.
You're recording at Gold
Star Studios next Wednesday.
Right in Hollywood.
Didn't you hear me?
That means he's gonna put you
under contract with Del-Fi.
Ah!
Oh, Richie,
I'm so happy!
It's only
the beginning, m'ijo.
Bob has
great news, too.
Come on,
tell her, man.
That art contest,
I won it.
$500 in prizes.
That's great, m'ijo.
With the baby coming,
the money will come-
In art lessons.
See? They gave me
a drafting table.
See?
All our dreams
are going to come true.
I just know it.
* Well *
* Now, baby, baby,
I love you so, now *
* Now I'll never, never
let you go, now *
* Come on, little baby *
* Let's go bye-bye *
Cut, Richie.
Let's start again.
* Well *
* I'll kiss you once *
* And I'll kiss you
once again, now *
Do it the way you did
the first time, okay?
* Hey, hey *
* Baby, baby,
tell me you love me *
* That you are always
thinkin' of me *
* Come on, come on *
* Let's go *
* And again and again *
Cut!
Richie,
that was our fault.
* Hey, hey *
* Baby, baby,
tell me you love me *
* That you are always
thinkin' of me *
* Come on, come on *
* Let's go *
* And again and again *
Cut!
That's more right-on, Richie,
but I like that
little darling line better.
* Well, well *
* Well, well *
* Well *
* Let's go, let's go *
* Let's go,
little sweetheart *
Cut.
What's wrong
with those takes?
That's the way
I sing.
Each take
has to be identical.
Why?
So we can edit later.
This isn't Mexico.
Who said it was?
I understand the tradition of the song.
They're always changing the lyrics.
I've never been to Mexico.
My music is my music.
You tell him, carnal.
Look, how many
more takes?
As many as it takes.
* Oh, well, baby,
I love you so *
* And I'll never
let you go *
* So come on, baby *
* Come on home *
* Oh, pretty baby,
I love you so *
* Well *
Cut!
That was good.
Same energy.
Just try it again.
* Come on, let's go
and do it again *
* Again and again
and again *
* Then again
and again and again *
* Come on, let's go
and do it again **
Shall I get
a new roll of tape?
No. I think we got him.
I can cut something here.
Nice work, Richie.
60 takes, man.
How's the throat?
I think we got it.
60 takes.
I didn't hear a difference
in one of them.
I'm ready to go home.
Sure. I want to discuss
one thing with you.
Come here.
What is it?
Your professional name.
From now on,
it's Ritchie with a "T."
R- I-T-C-H-I-E.
I got a new last name
for you, too.
Valens with an "S."
Ritchie Valens.
How's that?
I don't like it.
That's for shit, man!
Valenzuela was
our dad's name.
You can't cut it in half.
People in this business
change names...
like they change wives.
Even me.
My last name is Kuhn.
Look, trust me
on this one.
Let's just go.
Thanks.
Look, it could've
been worse.
You could've been
Ricky Zuela.
[ Ring ]
Hello?
Is Donna in?
No, she's not.
This is her father.
Can I help you?
Daddy, is it
Ritchie?
Uh, yeah...
um...
could you tell her
that Ritchie called again?
Yeah, okay.
He plays that goddamned
jungle music.
Need I say more?
Come on, honey.
You said it's not serious.
I hate Dad
when he acts like that.
I just hate him!
Good morning, survivors.
Call now and talk to me.
We got evicted.
We're sleeping in the car.
My wife is pregnant.
Your wife is pregnant
and sleeping in the car?
Yeah.
What kind of car
do you have?
A Rolls-Royce.
Ha ha ha ha!
Your mom listens
to KFWB, right?
Ritchie Valens' mom
listens, too,
and she's got to be
proud of her boy today.
Ritchie's got a song headed
for the top of the charts...
with a bullet.
Ritchie Valens'
Come On, Let's Go!
Hey, Bob.
How are you?
Good, good, good.
Valens, Valens.
Um... French, right?
How did you know?
Ese, ese.
He's one of those
barrio kids.
Not for long.
Pretty good.
I know.
*... swing, swing,
little darlin' *
* Come on, let's go,
little darlin' *
* Let's go,
let's go again... *
Everybody, keep it down!
That's my Ritchie
on the radio!
* And I'll
never let you go... *
Connie, how about
a beer?
Not while I'm working,
but I'll get you one.
* Oh, pretty baby,
I love you so *
* Well *
* Let's go, let's go *
* Let's go,
little sweetheart *
* That way we can
always be together *
* Come on, come on,
let's go again *
No, I'm sorry.
Donna's studying.
Here's a special contest
to kick off summer.
We have a special
mystery guest here.
Say hello, mystery guest.
Uh, hello.
Our mystery guest comes
from the San Fernando Valley.
What does he have in common
with the vice president?
The first person to identify
this mystery guest...
will win 12 fresh pizzas.
And this mystery guest
will deliver the pizzas...
and have a pizza party
at your place...
free from KFWB.
* Tell me
that you'll never leave me *
* Come on, come on *
* Let's go *
* Oh, again
and again and again *
* Come on, let's go
and do it again **
No, Donna's not here.
Thank you.
She's on a date.
Yeah...
right.
Yes. May I help you?
May I see Donna?
Please.
I know she's here.
Just one moment.
Donna?
It's Ritchie.
Better not to lead him on.
You know
how your father is.
Okay.
Hi, Ritchie.
Can we take a walk?
No, I can't.
Let's not beat
around the bush.
Are you seeing
other guys?
Yeah, I've been out
a few times.
What's wrong with that?
You're my girl.
And when am I
supposed to see you?
I can't tag along
to all your appearances.
All those other girls
going ape-
I don't care
about those other girls.
What am I supposed to do?
You don't have time
for me right now.
You want to
break it off?
I don't know
what I want anymore.
I'll see you around
sometime.
Ritchie!
[ Guitar Playing ]
* I've never been the same *
* 'Cause I love my girl *
* Donna, oh, where
can you be? *
* Where can you be? *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna- **
Yoo-hoo!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hello?
Sorry.
* Oh, Donna **
That's it.
That's your song.
I thought you'd
like to hear it.
It's beautiful.
Thank you.
Bye.
Yeah.
No, man, I think I know
what your problem is,
and it's time
we did something about it.
Come on, let's go.
Where to?
Let's just go, okay?
I should've done this
a long time ago.
Hop on.
Done what?
Gotten you some tail.
Oh, man!
Come on, Ritchie
with a "T,"
I'm gonna show you
the best part of T.J.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Ritchie,
check it out.
Don't worry.
It smell like fish,
but it'll taste
like chicken.
You're all right, man.
Man, I'm telling you!
This is your manager's job,
getting you some tail.
He looks at you
and sees a meal ticket.
Change the record,
will you?
Look, man, Ritchie Valens.
Ritchie Valens.
With a name like that,
nobody is even gonna
suspect you're Mexican.
I think it's an insult
to Steve's memory.
Steve was
so gung-ho American,
he'd be proud
of anything I do.
Lay off, okay?
It's my name.
Yeah, it's
your name, man.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
What did she say?
She likes your big...
[ Pop ]
What do you think?
Looks like a prom.
Only, this prom puts out.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Come on!
Oh, babe. Mmm.
Look at those bongos.
Get in there.
I can see fine.
Pick one you like.
They'll like you.
It's guaranteed.
Mmm.
Well?
I don't know.
You know, it's
really hard to choose.
Shit, take two, man.
It's on me.
Rrrrrr!
Rrrrrr!
La Bamba!
Hey, Ritchie,
come here, man!
Ritchie, I brought you here
to get laid.
Later.

[ Pounding On Door ]
I'm coming!
[ Bang Bang Bang ]
[ Bang Bang Bang ]
Rosie!
Oh, Connie,
I need your help.
It's the baby.
My God,
where's Bob?
Oh!
I'm going to
get Ritchie.
I'm getting Ritchie.
It's going to be okay.
Ah! Ahh!
[ Fly Buzzing ]
[ Dog Whines ]
[ Sheep Bleating ]
Arf! Arf! Arf!
[ Speaking Spanish ]
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Uh... yo... yo no speako
espanol.
Ha ha ha ha!
What's the big idea, Bob,
leaving me alone
with this old man?
Hey, man, had some business
to take care of.
Besides, you were
sleeping it off.
Was I that drunk?
You were screwed,
blewed, and tattooed.
Well, at least
tattooed anyway.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
The old man wants us
to eat breakfast.
I never had snake before.
It's not bad.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
What's he saying?
He says life
is a snake,
a snake crawling
out of its own dead skin...
like a dream.
He's a curandero,
a healer,
and a wise man.
He's sort of
my spiritual father.
I've been coming
to him for years.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
He's giving you that.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
"To live is to sleep.
[ Speaking Spanish ]
To die is to awaken. "
I told him about
your nightmares.
That talisman
will help...
if you believe in it.
What is all this?
Mexico.
Mexico!
You went to Tijuana
without telling anybody?
A fine pair
of sinvergüenzas!
I can expect this from Bob,
but not you, Ritchie.
So what did you do?
Drink the night away?
It was my fault.
I took him there.
How's Rosie?
She's in the hospital,
where else?
She was all alone.
I had to drive her
to the hospital.
She was in labor all day.
Do you hear me?
Do you care about anything?
Go ahead,
go play with your bike!
Did Rosie have
a boy or a girl?
A girl.
We named her Brenda.
What's this?
Bob.
Bob.
* Well, darlin' *
* Now that you're gone *
* I don't know
what I'll do *
* Our love's gone *
* And all my love for you *
* I had a girl *
* And Donna was her name *
* Since she left me *
* I've never been the same *
* 'Cause I love my girl *
* Donna, oh, where
can you be? *
* Where can you be? *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna **
That's beautiful, Ritchie.
That's the one.
In September, we have
the Pacific Ocean Park,
followed by the Santa Monica
Civic Auditorium...
High tone lunch, huh?
Followed by...
Are you listening?
A week's booking
in San Francisco.
Now, Ritchie,
we fly up for that one.
Fly? No, I'd rather drive.
Ritchie, please, it's a long drive.
I don't care.
I never fly, man.
I have my reasons.
All right, I'll see what I can do.
We still need another single
to go with Donna.
How about Suzie?
How about La Bamba?
It's not rock 'n' roll.
It is the way
I play it.
No. It's a folk song.
Besides, it's in Spanish.
That's how
I want to sing it.
Rock 'n' roll in Spanish?
You gotta be crazy.
It'll work.
Let me have a crack at it.
Even assuming the other side
of Donna was a throwaway,
how are you gonna handle
the lyrics?
You can't speak the language.
If Nat King Cole can
sing in Spanish, so can I.
Come on, Bob-o,
what do you say?
Bob-o?
Okay, now, smile.
Great!
[ Singing In Spanish ]
Ritchie!
Hello, baby!
It drives like a dream.
It beats
taking the train.
How much
did this baby cost?
You don't
want to know.
But if all goes well
in Philadelphia,
the car is yours.
Philly?
We're going
to Philadelphia?
American Bandstand.
Ha! Really?
Ritchie,
we fly up for that.
Okay?
* With a wiggle in her walk
and a giggle in her talk *
* Make the world
go 'round *
Come on, let's go!
*... like a big-eyed girl *
* To make me act so funny *
* Make me spend my money *
* Make me feel
real loose... **
I thought
you didn't like to fly.
I don't.
But I love
driving fast.
Let me in, damn it!
I want to see
my daughter!
I'm her father!
You're a goddamn drunk!
Bob, stop it, Bob!
Have you gone
crazy on me?
I've finally had it!
I want to see my daughter.
Not in your condition!
I went pendeja
for the motorcycle,
but no more.
I want my wife.
He wants a love slave
to kick around.
Sober up, then you
can see her tomorrow.
Now go downstairs
and pass out.
I got enough to worry about
with Ritchie.
You always worry more
about Ritchie.
What about me?
What about me?
I know you don't
give a goddamn about me!
You had me turned in.
You had me locked up.
You think I could ever
forgive you for that?
Fuck you!
¡M'ija!
You little bitch!
You can't keep me
from seeing my kid!
This is my house!
I'll kick you out!
Here you go.
Thank you.
You see anything?
Yeah. I just saw
the Grand Canyon.
It's a long way down.
Sir.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You know what, Bob-o?
I've always believed
I was gonna die in a plane crash.
That's a hell
of a thing to say...
while we're still
in the air.
Well, it's do or die.
American Bandstand,
Philadelphia, P.A.
Drink this.
It's vodka...
straight.
And away we go.
You are all
comfortably seated, I presume.
Let's have a nice greeting for a young man
who's making his debut here.
From Del-Fi Records
in Los Angeles,
ladies and gentlemen,
here's Ritchie Valens.
[ Cheering ]
* Oh, Donna *
* Oh, Donna *
* I had a girl *
* Donna was her name *
* Since she left me *
* I've never been the same *
* 'Cause I love my girl *
* Donna, oh, where
can you be? *
* Where can you be? *
* Now that you're gone *
* I'm left all alone *
* All by myself... **
What do you want?
Come on, I got money.
I don't want
your money.
Hey, what the hell!
Put that back on!
You've had enough,
buddy.
Put it back on.
That dude's my brother.
And I'm your Irish uncle.
Leave it off!
What did you think of Ritchie
on American Bandstand?
I can't believe
he sang Donna.
You are so lucky.
Who are you taking
to the dance?
Nobody.
[ Horn Honks ]
* Do you love me, too? *
* I love the way you talk *
* Oh, yeah, baby... **
Hi, kitten.
Hi.
So where's
your car?
It was a loaner.
My dad sold it.
Hop in.
See you later.
Hiya, Suzie.
Hiya, Ritchie.
Hi, Ritchie.
Can I have your autograph?
Could I get one, too?
Can we have your autograph?
Can we have your autograph?
I'll do one better.
I'll get you
Donna's autograph.
Just like old times, huh?
I've really missed you.
I've missed you, too.
So how's school?
Not the same
without you.
When are you
coming back?
My school days
are over, kitten.
Bob-o's got me booked
all winter and fall.
I'll be in the Big Apple.
I'm really happy
for you, Ritchie,
all your success
and everything.
You really deserve it.
I'm flying.
I'm really flying.
* Tweedlee, tweedlee,
tweedlee dee *
This way.
* Dee dee tweedlee dee *
* I'm as happy as can be *
Oh, Ritchie!
* Jiminy Crickets,

* You make my heart
go clickity-clack *
* Tweedlee, tweedlee,

* Dee dee tweedlee dee **
It's yours, Mom.
It's mine, Ritchie?
Yes.
Come on!
Come on!
Wow! Is this where
we're going to live?
It's like a castle.
This is home.
That's the garage.
And over there
is the guest house.
Huh? Ha ha ha!
Oh, Ritchie!
Come on, slowpoke!
Isn't it nice?
Isn't it nice, huh?
Right here is where
we'll put the swimming pool.
Yay! Yay!
No, Ritchie. The girls can't swim.
I don't want no pool.
Oh, okay.
We'll make it
an automatic dishwasher.
No problem. But after
we fly back East.
Back again?
Yeah. 10-day tour,
13 cities,
including a spot
on national television.
So congratulations,
Mrs. Valens.
Here are the keys
to your new home.
Oh, Ritchie, this is better
than Queen for a Day.
I love you, Mom.
Oh, Ritchie...
you're the best.
[ Music Playing ]
Well, let's rock it, now!
[ Crowd Noise ]
What's the matter,
Ritchie, nervous?
Hey, man, I'm just
a kid from Pacoima.
* I'm gonna take two weeks *
* Gonna have
a fine vacation *
* I'm gonna take my problem *
* To the United Nations *
* Well, I called my congressman,
and he said, quote *
* "I'd like to help you, son,
but you're too young to vote" *
* Sometimes I wonder
what I'm a-gonna do *
* But there ain't no cure
for the summertime blues *
Yeah!
* I said there ain't no cure
for the summertime blues **
Yeah!
You're gonna knock 'em
dead! Isn't he wonderful?
Eddie Cochran,
a wonderful human being!
And now for you rock cats,
another wonderful human being,
Mr. Jackie Wilson!
Come on!
Woo!
Yeah! Eddie,
you were great, man!
I mean, really
great, great!
Oh... it's that live
New York audience, man.
Rock 'n' roll's
an addiction.

* My pillow's never dry, oh *
* Lo-onely teardrops *
* Come home *
* Come ho-o-o-ome *
* Just say you will... *
Oh, here you are, Ritchie.
Where else would he be?
The kid's got taste.
One of the Belmonts
got sick.
Probably malnutrition, man.
You and your three-ring circus.
You're going on right after
Jackie Wilson. You can do it.
Yeah!
Good luck, Ritchie!
They're waiting!
Come on, let's go.
* My tears keep fallin' *
* Fallin' like rain *
* My heart's so heavy *
* I can feel the pain *

You-You were great,

If they love you,
they'll want to kill you.
If they don't,
same difference.
And here he is,
America's newest
rock 'n' roll sensation,
the California kid,
Ritchie Valens!
Here's a bit
of a rattlesnake.

This is the last time I
want to go away at Christmas.
I promise, Ritchie.
No, I mean it, Bob-0.
[ Horns Blow ] Surprise! Surprise!
Merry Christmas,
High Tone.
Ohh... I've missed you!
Oh, we're so
proud of you!
Go ahead
and open some.
Yay!
Yay!
Just-
Just the little kids.
Just the little kids.
Hey, Ritchie!
Hey! How are
you doing?
Look at all this food.
They don't have food
like this in New York.
Come on.
Help yourself!
Hi!
Ritchie, how are you?
Seven and seven?
Yeah.
What about you?
Hey, I'm on the wagon, man.
The garbage wagon.
$5.00 a week
and all you can eat.
With all this food,
I'm staying.
What's this stuff
in the bowl?
Menudo. Try it.
Bobby, where's
Mom's new dress?
What new dress?
The one I asked you
to buy her for Christmas.
You're the asshole
with money. You buy it!
* Ooh! My head *
* Let it go **
Ahh... don't let him
upset you, m'ijo.
He's been on the wagon
for a month now.
He's meaner
when he's drunk.
Come on. Help yourself.
¿Qué paso? Enjoy yourself.
Okay, everybody,
let's go in the living room.
I got a present for Ritchie.
Come on, Ritchie.
Come on!
Okay... m'ijo.
Woo!
Woo!
I feel like I just got mauled
by King Kong!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Okay, everybody, let's party.
This is a celebration.
My Ritchie is home!
Yay!
Yay!
[ Muted Party Noise ]
[ Door Opens ]
You okay, Bob?
Sure. I'm okay.
Mom was
asking for you.
Why? Is she
afraid I'm drunk?
I've had one sip of beer.
It tastes like piss. You want it?
Yeah. Thanks.
What's your problem, man?
Old Steve, boy,
he always said you were
going to be somebody,
and I bought it, too.
If that's the way
Steve wanted it,
that's the way
it was going to be,
even after he told me
he wasn't my dad!
Then when I knew the full
score, I understood, see?
I realized why
he treated you...
a little bit
better than me.
I said, you know, "I'll just hang
around and take the leftovers...
like a dog. "
That's how much
I loved Steve!
Like a goddamn dog!
Don't talk about this now.
Shit, no! I want to talk now,
and you're gonna listen!
That's a crock of shit!
He set you up to conquer the
world. He didn't leave me shit!
Nobody told you to
throw your life away!
I'm only sorry I didn't say something
about you being drunk half the time!
You did it to yourself!
You come in here like you own
the goddamn country!
To me you're always gonna be that
little asshole who followed me around!
Yeah, I followed
you around...
because I thought
you were somebody... then!
Don't you walk out on me!
Ennh!
Aw, shit!
Don't talk to me like this!
Umungh!
You want it, huh?
I'm not Rosie, asshole!
You asked for it!
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna kill you!
He couldn't have meant it,
Ritchie. He's just hurt.
Your success
can't be easy for him.
I love you, Donna.
I will always love you.
You sound so serious.
I am.
Ha! You know, I'm still
going to marry you...
one of these days.
Will you wait for me?
Yeah, for how long, forever?
No. Ha!
No, just till I'm, uh, 25,
and then I'll have
a big glass cabinet.
I'll keep all
my gold records in it.
How's that, huh?
I love you...
and I'm never going to
let anyone...
get in the way of my feelings
for you ever again.
Come here.
What?
Come here.

off my mi-i-ind *
* Cryin'... *
The heating system
in the bus broke down.
You didn't tell me this tour
was gonna be like this.
Come home, man.
You mean quit?
No, no. If you're
sick, man, you're sick.
I'm really sorry.
No. I'll stick it out.
Just see what you can do
about the bus.
Okay. Take care of yourself.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
[ Sniffs ]
Hello, baby!
Hey, Jake.
How you feeling, man?
Holly is lining up a plane...
to fly us to Fargo tonight.
All of us?
Just the headliners.
Get with it, or you're gonna
get left out in the cold.
You catch my snowdrift, man?
Like, the word is out!
Hey, guys!

[ Ring ]
Hello.
Hello, Bob?
It's me. Ritchie.
[ Coughs ]
What's wrong?
What do you mean?
I can barely hear you.
You sound funny.
I- I got a cold.
Listen, is Mom there?
No. No one's here.
They all went to church.
Just me
and my daughter here.
I was getting ready to go,
but you know how it is.
Yeah.
I sure wish I was there,
but I guess you can't have
your cake and eat it, too, huh?
Listen... Bob...
why don't you fly out to Chicago
and meet me, man?
We can finish out
the tour together.
I really got to have
some family around me.
You sure you
want me around...
after all, uh, that happened,
all the shit I said?
Hey, those were
your real feelings, man.
I mean,
we're still brothers, aren't we?
Bob... you still there?
Yeah, cabrón,
I'm still here...
and I'm still your brother.
[ Cheering ]
All right, man.
I'll see you in Chicago!
Later, alligator.
Ha ha ha!
[ Brenda Coos ]
Whoa! Hey,
where are the broads?
Look what
just rolled in.
Well, hello, baby!
Whoa, it's cold!
Woo! All right,
Ritchie, now,
here's the situation.
I heard how you felt
about flying.
It's between
Tommy and you now.
I'm going to
toss this coin.
Whoever wins
is gonna ride this plane...
and sleep
in a warm bed tonight.
Whoever loses is gonna
freeze his ass off on the bus.
Ritchie!
Heads!
[ Coughs ]
Heads it is!
All right. Ritchie,
let's fly, boy.
Allsup,
have a good ride.
See you
in North Dakota.
Sorry, Tommy. That's
the first coin toss I ever won!
Hey, come on, let's go!
Bye, Tommy!
Whoa!
Jesus, it's like
the Three Stooges.
Woo!
Ha ha ha! Is it cold!
Yeah!
[ Sniffs ]
Hey, Ritchie, relax, man.
Everything's cool.
Besides, the sky belongs
to the stars, right?

* Across the sea *
* There's a girl *

We interrupt
to bring you this bulletin.
Four persons,
three identified as nationally
famous rock 'n' roll singers,
died today in a plane crash
near Clear Lake, Iowa-
Buddy Holly, 22,
of Lubbock, Texas,
Ritchie Valens, 17,
of Los Angeles, California...
What the shit?
And J.P. Richardson, 29,
of Louisiana,
known as
the Big Bopper.
Bob... did you hear?
Did you hear what the
radio said about Ritchie?
Are you sure
he said Ritchie?
What we're able
to piece together...
Oh, God!
What about Connie?
[ Brenda Crying ]
Bob!
Buddy Holly, one of
rock 'n' roll's brightest lights,
was best known
forhis hits Peggy Sue...
What is it?
What's the matter?
You better sit down,
Donna.
...forhis hit, Chantilly Lace.
We understand
that Holly chartered the plane...
because the bus had broken down
several times and had no heating.
The single engine plane
left the Clear Lake airport...
shortly after 1:00 a. m.
The youngest of the stars
killed in this crash...
was Ritchie Valens.
At 17, this youngster
from Pacoima, California,
topped the charts
with his hits Donna, La Bamba,
and Come On, Let's Go.
Valens was still
in high school...
when he was signed
to the Del-Fi label,
and just eight months later,
Ritchie Valens is gone.
No!
No!
Now, this selection
in honor of the dead.
Not Ritchie!
Not my Ritchie!
[ Music Playing ]
Bob! Not my Ritchie!
Not Ritchie!
Not Ritchie, Bob!
Oh, God!
Oh! Ohh!
...of his ascendance.
Yet here
in the San Fernando Valley,
as, perhaps,
throughout the entire nation,
the name of Ritchie Valens...
Ritchie!
