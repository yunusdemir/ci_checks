I don't wanna go to school.
I said I don't
wanna go to school.
Oh, is that what that was?
Mom..
You can't stay here
with me all day, Sophia.
But I can help you.
I know how to pick up a phone
when it rings.
You know how
to do a lot of things.
You are very smart.
Smarter than me, definitely.
Then why do I have to go
to school?
Here, I'll make you a deal.
This weekend I'll show you
how to use the washing machine.
I can help you fold sheets?
Yes, you can.
Now go finish getting ready
for school.
Carpool's gonna be here
in a second.
<i>- ..public radio.</i>
<i>- I'm John McNaughton.</i>
In today's weather, it's gonna
<i>be cold and cloudy..</i>
<i>dipping down into the 20s,</i>
<i>so watch out tonight</i>
<i>on some of the roads.</i>
<i>Warming up a bit tomorrow</i>
<i>but not too much.</i>
<i>Highs around 40. It's gonna</i>
<i>stay that way most of the week.</i>
<i>The Winter Lake Festival</i>
<i>gets underway..</i>
Don't forget
to brush your teeth!
Hey.
Sorry.
We fell asleep.
Billy said it was fine.
Mom, I'm ready!
Come on down.
- Hi, Stella.
- Hi.
Okay, baby,
let's get this off.
Mom, I forgot
to feed Mr. Jones.
That's okay, baby.
I'll do it.
Denise will pick you up
at 3, okay? I love you.
Love you too, Mom.
Bye, Stella.
Bye.
Thanks, Barb.
Shit.
<i>- The last two times we spoke,</i>
<i>- I told you</i>
that a concern had been raised
about the suitability
of an environment like this
for a child as young as..
Her name is Sophia.
Given the high rate
of turnover
of a mostly transient,
mostly male population
and.. the local girls.
We're leaving, but winters
are slow around here.
There's nothing I can
do about it.
Unfortunately,
it is still unacceptable
by the legal standards enforced
by the state.
What's that?
You have two weeks
to relocate Sophia
to a more suitable location.
Failure to do so will result
in her being removed
from the premises.
What do you mean, "removed"?
This is a commercial property
with multiple reports
of drug use and prostitution.
Your choice to use it as your
place of residence cannot..
We're leaving, all right?
I told you that.
But I can't afford it right now.
There's always placement
just until you get your feet
back on the ground.
We have a number of families
who'd be happy to take Sophia.
Could you stop it?
These are good families,
Mrs. Russell.
Would you stop it?
Please.
I'd rather be dead.
Then you have two weeks.
Was dating this chick
and, uh..
she's Russian, right?
And I understand, like,
every eighth word, right?
Heh-heh. And her dad
bought her tits for her.
You ever heard
of something like that?
They're big and they're hard.
She got them done
back in the homeland.
It's, like, fucking hilarious.
Phew.
It's cold, right?
My stomach's been eating itself
for the last hour, you know?
Should probably
fill up again anyways.
You never know when the next
gas station's gonna be out here.
That cool, right?
Yeah?
All right, cool.
Mom?
Hm?
Stella Bradshaw says
no one's really
supposed to live at a motel.
You're supposed
to stay one or two nights
and then leave and go back
to your real house.
Stella Bradshaw said that?
Yes.
How many bathrooms
do you think
Stella Bradshaw has
at her house?
I don't know.
Maximum two.
You know how many bathrooms
you have? Twenty-two.
That's more than they have
in Buckingham Palace.
You know
what that makes you?
A princess.
Mom, you're crazy.
Crazy like a fox.
I love you, baby.
Love you too, Mom.
Close your eyes.
Here you go.
Find everything you need?
Yeah, totally.
Motherfuck,
it's cold outside!
So, uh, so listen,
the thing is I've been driving
for 22 fucking hours straight.
I can use
a little shut-eye.
I have schedule to keep.
I know, I know.
They do not like to wait.
No, no.
But we're good.
We're real good on time.
We got a whole day for
the last couple hundred miles.
I can see a motel
from here.
We check in separately.
We sleep for four hour
then drive.
Cool.
Four hour.
Four hours. Got it.
Hello.
Yes, I would like quiet room
for one night, please.
Forty-four dollars, please,
and you'll need to fill
one of these out.
Ah. Do you have pen?
Yeah, that one works
just fine right there.
If you could fill out
your name, your home address
and your license plate number,
please.
I.. I walk from diner.
Huh. Did you eat?
What?
Did you eat?
It's good there.
No.
Was it busy?
I was hoping for some
of that run-off, you know?
All right.
And, um, I'll need to xerox
your ID, please, sir.
I will pay cash.
Yep, still need your ID.
I have a friend
who's a cop in town.
He's always going on
about me xeroxing IDs, so..
Well..
Everybody has job.
He was 15 minute late,
but I checked
and everything was there.
Yes, I will cross border
first thing in the morning.
Jacques, it is a pleasure
to be working
for your father again.
Please thank him
for the opp..
Ha-ha!
Ow, motherfucker.
You shut the fuck up.
You shut the fuck up.
Come on, you dumb bitch.
Ow! What the..
Get the fuck off me!
Ow! Get the fuck off me! Aah!
What the fuck is going on
up there?!
No!
What did you do?!
Look at me!
Get away from me!
- Hey.
- Yeah.
Everything all right?
- Hey!
- I called the police.
Hello?
Open up.
Somebody call 911!
John roughs up Gwen,
Gwen slashes John,
and John manages to shoot her
before bleeding out.
You wanna sit here and say,
"No, forget it.
It couldn't happen."
And then..
it happens.
That's some nonfiction
right there, you know?
I just saw Gwen this morning.
Hey, how's, uh,
how's Sophia doing?
She okay?
Denise came and got her.
She didn't see anything,
thank God.
That's great. Good.
Oh, no, no.
Floyd, shit for brains,
the Jeep!
The Jeep!
Fucking idiot.
I'm sorry. What?
Billy, we have to stop letting
the girls use the rooms.
Yeah, I mean,
you know, it's..
It's not like this is ever
gonna happen again, Chlo.
I mean, besides,
you're not the only one
who relies on that cash.
I had a woman
from social services today.
She told me I got two weeks
to get out of my place.
If she hears about this,
then Sophia's gone tomorrow.
Two weeks?
Hey. Hey.
Doesn't matter. Okay?
Because you and I, we're gonna
get through this together.
I'm gonna help you.
Okay? You and me.
Just like after Vincent died,
I'm gonna be there for you.
Okay?
Billy?
Yeah?
We have to stop letting
the girls use the rooms.
Okay. Okay. Yeah.
Thank you.
John Doe and the girl
were DOA.
<i>Anyone else there?</i>
As far as we can tell,
he was traveling alone.
Sophia?
I thought everybody had gone.
Oh, yes, but I believe
these are yours, yes?
You could have just left them
in the room. Thank you.
Oh, yes, well, uh, sorry,
but with all the confusion..
Heh.
Oh, okay, I see.
Okay, one second, please.
Thank you.
Aah!
Make no sound.
Open this door.
Open it.
100 bucks in the register.
You can have whatever you want.
Quiet. Where is cell phone?
I-I don't ha..
I don't have it.
Do not lie to me again.
Okay.
Who else live here?
Just me and my daughter.
Your daughter, where is she?
With a friend. They're both
coming back any minute.
The Jeep
that was here last night,
where did they take it?
What Jeep?
The man who was killed
by the whore.
The police towed his car.
Where did they take it?
Uhh!
Oof!
Ohh! Ahh!
Feel that?
Mom!
Hm?
You let the little girl
and only the little girl in,
or I shoot everyone dead.
Okay.
Okay.
Mom, the puppy slept
in the bed with me!
Ohh. Was it cozy?
They're friends for life,
I'm sure of that.
And, uh, hey,
how you feelin', hon?
I'm okay. Denise,
can you do me a huge favor?
Just take her
for a couple more hours.
No, Mom, please.
Come on.
Listen, I'm sorry.
I got a..
I got a double shift
in an hour,
then I got Randall
coming over, as he does
with about the frequency
of a comet.
Denise..
Never mind.
Any other day.
You know I'm good for it.
Get the key.
You look after your mom,
okay?
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Okay, baby,
you go upstairs
and watch TV while I talk
to this man, okay?
Who are you?
I am friend
of your mother's.
Upstairs now.
I ask once last time,
where would police take Jeep?
If I find out, will you go?
You will get me that Jeep
or I will put bullet
in your little girl's ear.
<i>Hey, Rodney, it's Billy.</i>
Okay, so look,
I got a '95 white Jeep Cherokee.
Yeah.
Uh, 78,000 miles, give or take.
And look..
Uh, sorry.
Look, man, it's gonna be
the same deal, okay?
Wait two weeks,
things calm down,
they'll think it's going
to the heap.
I can't do anything less
than $1300 on this one.
Okay, but, hey, man, look,
there's no radio.
Yeah, I think somebody picked it
before we got to it.
<i>Billy, it's Chloe again.</i>
Will you please call me back?
Thank you.
He will call me back.
And he'll get the car to you
clean and easy, I swear it.
Where does this Billy live?
Ah, little girl.
You have jacket?
Of course,
everyone has a jacket.
Of course.
Please go get yours, huh?
We are all going for drive.
Mommy.
- You okay back there?
- Can't we play I Spy?
We can play later, I promise.
Okay, I promise.
Fine.
I spy with my little eye
something white.
- Here he is.
- Go.
You won't hurt her?
That depend on you.
When you come back to car,
you come back alone.
If it's Stephanie,
just tell her
to shut the fuck up
about..
All right. Jesus, relax.
Fuck are you doing here?
I need to talk to Billy.
What the fuck do you need
to talk to Billy for?
Huh, Chlo?
You two don't get enough
of each other
at that little shithole motel
of yours
doing whatever it is
the fuck you do all day?
Chlo?
I need to talk to you.
So talk.
Amber, inside.
I'm not going anywhere.
Amber, shut up
and take this, please.
You asshole.
And pause it.
You can fucking
rewind it!
What the fuck
you doin' here, Chlo?
The Jeep Cherokee you picked up
from my place last night?
I know a guy who wants to buy.
It's a really good price.
I'll take a little cut.
I need the cash.
What are you talking about?
Billy, we both know
about your deal with Rodney.
The guy doesn't just want parts,
he wants the whole car.
Hey, it's evidence
in an ongoing investigation.
I can't just give that
to you.
Since when do you care?
It's evidence,
and soon it'll be paperwork,
and then it'll be
a cube of garbage.
You sound like you're
on the television.
Whatever.
I can't help you.
So why don't you just
get out of here, Chlo?
You've done enough.
Well, maybe I'll just talk
to your chief about it, then.
About what?
Maybe he wants to hear about
your little bait-and-switch.
Get your fucking hands
off me!
Goddamn it, Chloe.
You gotta be more careful.
What did he say?
He said no.
Do you see it?
There's a chain link fence all
around and police everywhere.
Find a way.
It's blocked in.
- We do not need to move it.
- We need to get inside.
Behind stereo,
inside is a package.
It will take you no more
than two minute of prying.
Take it.
Now..
get out of the car.
The sound of that shot
will wake your little Sophia,
and she will look around
because she needs her mother,
and she will find her mother,
but she will be splattered
all over the window
and the fucking dashboard
and the steering wheel.
Now I am going to count
to five.
Trust me when I tell you
if you do not get
out of the car,
you will not hear me
say five.
One.
Two.
Three.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'm going.
I'm going.
Wake up, little girl.
Where's my mom?
That is a good question.
Do you see her out there?
What is she doing?
I tell you what.
Let us play the I Spy, huh?
You tell me what you spy.
That's not how you play.
It is how I play.
You can't just
change the rules like that.
Yes, I can.
Tell me what you see.
Oh, fine.
Looks like she's trying
to get inside a car.
Okay, baby,
put your headphones on.
It's gone.
It's gone.
Whatever was in there,
somebody got to it
before we did.
I'm not lying to you.
Take us back to motel.
Come.
I need to know
what's gonna happen next.
You can at least
tell me that.
Tomorrow morning you will talk
to your friend Billy
and you will find out
who work on car.
What are you doing?
I'm guessing no one's
getting any sleep, right?
I need caffeine.
So I'm making tea.
Is that all right
with you?
What was in the package?
I was gonna see it anyway.
I'm not gonna sit in silence
for the next however many hours,
and as long as you have
that gun, I'm gonna be nervous,
and as long as I'm nervous,
I'm gonna talk.
Was it drugs or money?
It's cash, isn't it?
It's a lot I bet, huh?
So, what do they call
someone like you?
It's a "mule," right?
I collect packages..
and bring them
to where they belong.
You want to know
what I think?
No.
I think your employers don't
know about your vision problem.
Maybe it wasn't so bad
for a while,
but now you can't hardly
see anything.
What are you gonna do,
right?
I mean, there's not much demand
for a blind guy
whose only skill
is killing people.
Very perceptive
for a motel clerk
in this godforsaken brothel.
What if I told you I knew
where the money was?
We both know
where the money was.
I mean where the money is.
It sounds to me
like you're already fucked.
So either you leave here
empty-handed
and wait for the people whose
money it is to come find you
and do whatever it is
they're gonna do to you,
which I'm guessing
is something really bad,
or maybe
you think
about buying some time
and taking your half
of the money.
I see.
And the other half,
I presume,
you think is yours.
Hm.
You have no idea
how in over your head
you are.
And you have no idea
what it's like
to have a child to feed
and no place to go.
I have been on my own
since I was 15 years old,
scrambling for cash,
and nobody gives a fuck.
And I'm not
gonna do that again,
and I'm not gonna do that
to my daughter.
Little girl,
you are being very reckless.
So we go tomorrow?
And what if I do not care
to wait?
You can leave here
empty-handed.
So..
You got a name?
Topo.
I want to go lie down
with my daughter.
But you said you were gonna
let me use the washing machine.
I know, baby.
We'll do it next week, okay?
Mommy's got something
really important to do today.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Now tell Denise I'm putting
your food in the back, okay?
The man in the pictures,
he is girl's father?
Since when have you
been looking at my pictures?
So he left you?
No, he did not leave me.
He was fixing a flat
by the side of the road
and a truck hit him
and didn't stop.
He was a good man.
I showed up with nothing.
Except the baby
in your belly.
What about you, anyway?
You walk alone
or something like that?
It's no big deal
your partner got shot?
He was an idiot.
My sister's kid.
Jesus.
Good help is hard to find.
There he is.
And?
He's got a TV,
a big flat one.
Give me your phone.
Oh, come on.
It's a burner, isn't it?
A guy like you
doesn't get a phone bill
with his name on it.
Give me your phone.
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Go. Go, come on.
Get the fuck out of here.
I knew it.
What?
What did he do?
What did you say?
I said,
"I know you have the money."
He's turning.
He's turning.
All right. Are there cars
between you and him?
Uh, yeah, two.
Okay, slow down.
Keep your distance.
But try not to make it look like
you are keeping your distance.
What does that mean?
Don't look so nervous.
How do you know
I look nervous?
Because I can hear it.
Shit.
Shit!
Shit.
What is it?
Shit.
Agh. What are you doing?
He's pulling a U-turn.
Did he see you?
I don't know.
Find a place to turn around.
Get back on main street.
We will catch up to him.
It's him.
What do I do?
<i>Turn off your engine.</i>
Turn off your engine.
<i>Step out of the goddamned</i>
<i>vehicle, Chlo.</i>
You let him come to us.
I will take care of it.
<i>I said, step out</i>
<i>of the goddamned car.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna say it again.</i>
Do not leave the car.
Stay in the goddamned car!
<i>All right, stop right there!</i>
<i>Turn around, Chlo.</i>
<i>Turn the fuck around!</i>
<i>Good. Now put your hands</i>
<i>on your head.</i>
<i>Now back up slow.</i>
<i>Keep coming.</i>
<i>Keep coming. Come on.</i>
<i>Come on, keep coming.</i>
<i>Now get on your knees.</i>
<i>Drop to your</i>
<i>fucking knees, Chloe!</i>
Billy..
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
Aah. Unh!
What the fuck do you think
you're doing following me?
Spread 'em.
Billy, what are you doing?
Shut the fuck up
and spread your legs.
Fuck!
Guess what.
You're gonna tell me
what the fuck is going on,
do you understand me,
or you're gonna make me
fucking choke it out of you,
you understand?
Huh? Huh?
Are you fucking..
Are you think you're fucking
shaking me down?
After every fucking thing
I did for you, Chlo?
Huh? After every..
That is enough.
Okay, okay.
Easy, easy now.
Hey, easy, easy.
Take it easy, man.
Easy. It's okay.
I mean, uh, who the fuck
do we have here now, Chlo..
Shut up! Put these on him.
You wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?
That's what I was trying
to tell you, Billy.
He made me follow you.
He said
that he would kill Sophia.
You gotta do what he says,
Billy. The guy is crazy.
Okay, pal, look,
we can just talk, okay?
Shut fuck up!
Can I do something
for you?
Hm?
Get up.
Time we take drive, yes?
You are so fucked.
So, Mr. Billy,
I give you one last time.
Where is the money?
I have no idea
what you are talking about.
Mm.
How much
was the television set?
The tel-e-vision set?
It was a nickel, pal, okay?
About as much as it costs
to go to the movies. Heh.
You make joke..
because you are nervous.
And you should be.
A dumb cop like you,
you like to take it out
and feel it,
so you keep it close, huh?
Like in your bedroom?
Or maybe under your bed?
Am I close?
We go to his house.
It's not gonna make
any difference.
I don't..
TOPO: Shut up.
Ahem.
This is it.
Is anyone inside?
Fuck you, old man.
He has a wife.
Is your wife home?
How the fuck am I supposed
to know what she does all day?
Let us find out.
You. Go.
If you want your friend to live,
you bring money back.
What the fuck are you doing
in my house?!
Huh?!
Fucking lost
or something, honey?!
Who the fuck
do you think you are?!
Get out of fucking car.
Billy give you keys
to our fucking house?
So he can fuck you
In our bed?!
What.. What the fuck
did you do, Chlo?
Did you find the money?
I have it.
You fucking bitch!
What is it?
Why are we stopping?
Come on!
We need to go back to motel.
The policeman should have
told us that she was inside.
You didn't have to kill her.
She was out of control.
Now we need to get back
to motel to count it.
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine,
10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20 bundles, including
the one you're holding.
All hundreds. Not enough
for what just happened.
You take the cop's gun
and you put it where no one
will ever find it.
Take.
There's a car
in the driveway.
Hey, what are you doing
in my place?
Did you find it?
Yeah.
It wasn't where you said,
but we got it.
What's going on?
What are you doing?
What is who doing?
Hey!
What, you're deaf now too?
Half of that is mine!
Get your fucking hands off me!
Get your fucking hands
off me!
- We're just working here.
- Topo!
Get the fuck
out of my way!
Let's go.
Topo.
Topo!
Okay, so I say,
tomorrow,
a sleepover, okay?
Mommy.
Call the police.
Come with me.
Mommy!
Come on, Sophia.
What's the matter with Mommy?
She's fine. We're gonna
call the police, okay?
Cops.
Just keep driving.
Heh. Dumbasses.
How much was in jar?
2300.
Little more, I think.
You think?
Twenty-three and change.
Why? How much
was off the package?
Two thousand exactly.
That's good.
You want me to count it again?
Not necessary.
The money
has already been counted.
That's a crazy-ass bitch
back there, huh?
Keep your mouth shut.
And slow down!
You are speeding.
Just going back.
You say the assailant
forced you
into Officer Banks' home
to retrieve a package
from Officer Banks.
That's right.
Okay.
And upon entering
Officer Banks' residence,
you were then attacked
by Officer Banks' wife.
That's correct.
At which point
the assailant fired one shot
and killed her.
Yes.
So in your opinion,
was Officer Banks known
to your assailant?
Excuse me?
Do you think
they knew each other?
How would they know each other?
Did Officer Banks say that?
Unfortunately, we haven't been
able to locate Officer Banks.
We found the wife's body
and the radiator where
you said he was hand-cuffed,
but by the time
we reached the crime scene,
he was gone.
Any thoughts, any ideas
where he might be?
No, I.. No, I don't know
where Officer Banks could be.
You think there's any chance
he might show up here?
Here? Why?
Seeing as that
he apparently fled the scene
of his own wife's homicide,
he hasn't resurfaced to make
a report, we honestly don't know
what's going
through his mind right now.
Listen, just to be safe,
we'll post a cruiser
out front of your apartment
all night long, all right?
Donnie?
Black Cadillac. Quebec plates.
<i>How many are there?</i>
Windows are tinted.
I d.. I..
Maybe two?
Are you sure?
Yeah, yeah.
There's two, I'm sure.
<i>It looks like they want you</i>
<i>to come over to them.</i>
Right.
You alone out here, homes?
You know that I am,
Jacques.
What's with the glasses?
No problems.
Besides you being
two days late?
Circumstances.
I took care of it.
Oh, you took care of it?
Maybe you been
out of the game too long,
you forgot how to talk
to your boss, homes.
I am sure
that if you ask your father..
Nah, dog.
I don't gotta
ask nobody nothing.
Of course.
You are right.
It will not happen again.
Get in.
Why?
Because Alain
is going to count it.
What's this supposed to be?
It is all there.
- We were 2000 short..
- Two short?
Motherfucker, you are way off.
I'm sorry?
Fuck you are.
This package is 50 light,
homes.
Check again.
I don't need
to check again.
Where's the fucking rest?
Jacques, listen.
Nah, fuck that.
I don't need that.
I listen all the fuck time.
To my mama, to my girlfriend,
too, motherfucker.
Listen to my old man
who said I should use Topo,
that Topo could use the work.
And what is with
the fucking glasses?!
I'm gonna count to five,
Topolewski.
You tell me
where you put the rest.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Hey, baby, how's Denise's?
<i>Where are you, Mom?</i>
I'm at home.
I'm just taking care
of a few things.
<i>Is the man with the glasses</i>
<i>still there?</i>
No, no, the man's gone.
<i>Why's he gone?</i>
<i>Mom?</i>
<i>You there?</i>
Baby, I was thinking
that maybe when
I pick you up tomorrow
from Denise's, that..
instead of coming home,
maybe we'll..
We'll just move.
<i>And just leave?</i>
You know, even if we move,
we'll still have each other,
right?
<i>But what about Mr. Jones?</i>
Mr. Jones can come too.
All right, baby.
I love you.
<i>I love you too.</i>
Sleep tight.
<i>Good night, Mom.</i>
Greene County?
Yeah, I think
there's been an accident,
um, at the gas station
on Route 23.
Thank you.
You know that
I did not come alone.
You have to leave. There are
police watching this place.
There ought to be,
but they are not.
You stoled $50,000
from package.
I still have it upstairs.
I can get..
Stop!
Imagine my surprise
when my employers found it out.
But you weren't supposed
to take it back to them.
You were supposed to keep half
for yourself. That was the plan.
And before you even knew
I took the 50 grand,
you wrecked my apartment
and you took my money!
It was insurance.
I was gonna make it right
when we split it,
and alls you had to do was
keep your side of the bargain.
But you didn't.
You did the wrong thi..
I did the wrong thing.
I did the wrong thing.
You are afraid,
and when you are afraid,
you talk too much.
Goodbye, Chloe.
No, please.
Sophia doesn't have anyone.
Please, 'cause Sophia
doesn't have anyone.
Your half.
Why are you doing this?
Because good help is hard
to find.
Whoa!
Oh, somebody left a bunch
of fucking money here!
Somebody very carelessly,
they just left a bunch
of fucking money here!
Some careless bitch
who was stupid enough
to lie to me,
you just left a bunch
of your fucking money here!
Hey! Hey!
Put that fucking phone down.
Put your hands up.
Put your fucking hands up, Chlo.
What the fuck is this, Chlo?
It's not what it looks like.
Do me a favor.
Keep fucking lying to me.
I..
Keep fucking lying to me.
I swear to fucking God,
keep doing it.
I beg of you!
Huh? I mean, where..
Where the fu..
Where do you fucking think
you're going?
You think you're going
to fucking Hawaii or something
after your little boyfriend
fucking killed Amber?
Billy..
You're not gonna shoot me.
Bang! Bang, bang, bang!
No, see?
I shot the fuck out of your
fucking friends out there.
I was discharging my weapon
all over the fucking place.
Did you see how I did that,
Chlo?
I didn't see.
No, you didn't fucking
see that? You fuck.
You're a.. You're a..
You're a b..
You're a bad person, Chlo.
You're a bad person.
You are. You're a mother
and you're a bad person.
You're a fucking liar,
you're an accomplice,
you're a murderer,
and you..
You could have been
Mrs. Billy Banks.
Huh?
Where are you fucking going,
Chlo?!
Huh?
I'm leavin'.
Can I.. Can I come?
Please, just you and me.
All you have to do
is say yes.
But..
See what you..
Did you see what you..
You see
what you fucking just did?
Why do you always
fucking tease?
Why did you make love to me
all those fucking times
if you didn't even mean it?
Why'd you do that?
I mean, why did you
fucking do this to me?!
I'm fucking sorry, Billy!
I'm fucking sorry!
I'm sorry!
Okay, well..
I.. I know there's more money.
And I know that
you know where it is,
so I want you to tell me
where the fucking rest
of the money is right now, Chlo.
Come here.
Come here, show me.
Show me.
Yeah, come here, show me.
Don't fucking worry, Chlo.
I'm not gonna
fucking touch you.
Huh?
Is this it?
I should have seen it coming,
using me, just like
you used Vincent.
Yeah, just like you probably
used those two guys over there.
Why'd you do it, Chlo?
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it?
Stop, stop, stop.
Come on. Come on, Chlo.
Come on.
Why'd you do this to us?
Go..
I'm gonna go.
So you think Billy
had been dealing
with these people for a while?
Yeah, yeah,
I'd say that Officer Banks
got in way over his head.
Listen, are you sure
you don't want
to come down to the station,
talk to someone?
I'm anxious to see
my daughter.
Of course you are.
You two got a place
to go to, right?
Yeah.
We're okay.
Thank you.
Listen, one other thing.
We found this roll of cash.
It was $2300,
mostly small bills,
5s, 10s,
that kind of thing.
Didn't match
the other money.
I thought
it might be yours?
No, sir.
Mom!
Baby.
Baby.
Oh, baby!
Oh, you washed your hair?
You okay?
I'm fine.
So, baby, you know
what I was thinking?
No.
I was thinking about
what Stella Bradshaw said,
and I think maybe she's right.
Maybe people aren't supposed
to live in motels.
Mom..
You're crazy.
Mm.
I know.
