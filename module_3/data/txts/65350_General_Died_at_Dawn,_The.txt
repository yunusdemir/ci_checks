(baby crying)
(speaking Chinese)
There they are:
refugees from Anshan,
or what used to be Anshan
before GeneraI Yang
rode through it.
(Iaughs)
And who is
GeneraI Yang?
Why, he's the warIord
of this province,
and a sweII guy
to do business with.
But why does
he want to destroy
his own towns?
Oh, because they refuse
to pay their taxes.
WeII, I shouId think
those peopIe wouId Iearn
how to obey the Iaw,
rather than suffer this.
Ah, these peopIe
have no nerves, no feeIings.
They're used
to suffering.
But they can't
get used to paying.
(both Iaughing)
Excuse me, Madam.
You got a match,
CoIoneI?
No,
I don't smoke.
CoIoneI.
Refuse me a match,
wiII you?
But I haven't a match.
And those peopIe
didn't have the pennies
to pay GeneraI Yang.
Think it over.
(monkey chattering)
He's cute.
What is his name?
Sam.
How does he keep cooI
in this hot weather?
Room 26.
Stay there, Sam.
I bring you greetings
from Mr. Wu, GeneraI Pen.
I'm O'Hara.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara.
You startIed me at first.
I didn't expect him
to send a foreigner.
WeII, he thought
I'd have a better chance
of getting through.
Mr. Wu is very wise.
With his heIp,
we wiII rid the province
of Yang and his Iocusts.
Riding through,
I didn't see much Ieft
for Yang to pIunder.
The bark on trees, perhaps.
And that is why he has made
so many short, desperate raids
the past months.
His ordinary soIdiers
are deserting by the dozens
for the Iack of rice.
His ammunition is so IittIe,
it is distributed chiefIy
among his personaI guard.
Dear O'Hara, this is the time
we have waited for.
Here is the money.
Mr. Wu gave you instructions?
To the ''T.''
To which, aIIow me to add,
I am ashamed to say,
''Be carefuI.''
Not onIy for the Iove
we bear you,
but for the sake
of that money,
and the guns it wiII buy.
I'II get through.
It is of my opinion that
GeneraI Yang wouId sacrifice
haIf his personaI guard
for that beIt.
Which is to say,
he wouId give his arms
and Iegs for it.
You don't advise the train
from Pengwa?
No.
Wait for the pIane in Pengwa.
It wiII be arranged.
Good.
And even there,
GeneraI Yang
has speciaI agents.
So be carefuI
and onIy by pIane.
Mr. O'Hara.
From the time
you cIose that door,
untiI the time you deIiver
that money to Mr. Wu
in Shanghai,
the fate of the peopIe
of this entire province
is in your hands.
I'II get through.
Must be
a very carefuI job.
I can do it.
(coughs)
Why aII the secrecy?
'Cause the man O'Hara
is here in Pengwa.
GeneraI Yang says--
I know.
I've done those jobs
for him before,
aII kinds.
GeneraI Yang knows
he can trust me.
Your shot, Judy.
Your daughter has
beautifuI form,
Mr. Perrie.
Don't worry
about her.
I got it aII straight, see,
so you don't need to worry.
I'm to get this O'Hara
on a train,
and then Ieave
the rest to you.
He's got something
GeneraI Yang wants, huh?
Yes.
Money for an opposite side
with which to buy guns.
For this reason,
care must be exercised.
AIso for the reason
the generaI himseIf
needs guns badIy.
(cue baIIs cIinking)
Hmm.
O'Hara by any chance
a cock-eyed feIIow?
No. American.
Staying at your hoteI.
I'II point him out
to you Iater.
WeII, you know,
it won't be easy
to get a man Iike that
on a train
when he wants
to go by pIane.
A beautifuI woman
does it very easy.
She's high-spirited,
don't worry.
Wait for me,
I'II be back.
I'II wait.
(peopIe chattering)
(Peter)
Now, Judy.
Judy.
PIease, Judy.
No. No. No!
AII right.
I'm not Iuring men
to their death on trains,
a man I never saw.
(crying)
(Peter continues crying)
(whistIing)
""(humming)
Judy.
(sniffIes)
Open this for me,
wiII you?
(sniffIing)
What good
are these piIIs?
I don't know.
Someone said
they were good.
Who?
Someone.
I can't remember.
I've had
so many doctors.
This is no pIace for us,
China.
Isn't it, Pete?
A man ought to die at home,
a Christian death.
I--I've waited months
for a chance
to make enough to Ieave.
Now it's possibIe.
Oh, pIease don't
come back to that again.
If you'II heIp,
it's possibIe.
WeII, maybe it doesn't
mean much to you.
You never saw America.
But if I have
six months to Iive--
You want
to Iive it there.
New York. Nyack.
I--I'd get a house on the hiII
Iooking over the river.
Oh, it means so much,
it does.
I--I want
to sit there.
There's boats.
They go up
and down the river.
You can't do this
to me, Judy.
You're me, my kid.
It's six months,
then you're free.
You can do
what you want then,
but heIp me now.
Oh, what's the use?
You've been pIaying me
for a sucker
for as many years
as I'm oId.
WiII you do it?
Sure.
Sure, I wiII.
Why not?
Don't feeI Iike that,
Judy.
I don't feeI
any way at aII. I...
Just Ieave me aIone,
wiII you?
Maybe someday
there wiII be a Iaw
to aboIish the bIues.
Something big,
Iike an amendment
to the Constitution.
For aII of us.
(train engine roaring)
(peopIe cIamoring)
(train whistIe bIowing)
(coughing)
O'Hara is now on the train,
from the other side.
Can you beat it?
He's afraid.
Don't bIame him.
Goodbye.
(beII cIanging)
He's on.
Any cigarettes?
Be carefuI,
Judy.
I'II see you
tomorrow.
Yang's stopping
the train at 8:00.
See you
after then.
See you tomorrow.
Boo.
He remembers me.
Did you expect me?
What are you doing
hiding behind doors?
I Iive here tiII tomorrow.
Do you mind?
I don't mind.
Do you Iike me,
Judy?
I wish
you hadn't come.
Do you?
Like you?
Yes.
It's comfortabIe.
''Cozy,'' said the spider
to the fIy.
Preparations?
Lots of things on the ground
don't Iike me.
For instance?
WeII, uh...
There are certain
busy Lizzies
who scoot around
taking potshots.
At you?
Mmm-hmm.
But the train's moving.
Sure,
the train's moving,
and it's nighttime
and we're aIone.
And I Iike the Iady
and she Iikes me.
Judy, you've got me
by the throat,
and I'm teIIing you,
whether it's dopey or not.
Judy.
Don't do that.
No?
You don't
want to do that.
That's what
you say.
What do you think of that,
Sam?
(chattering)
Come on.
You know, Judy, uh,
I'm not one
of the anxious boys.
You're a good guy.
I can wait.
Wanna hear
something funny?
I'm crazy
for a Iaugh.
I'm scared. Afraid.
Because of me?
Yes.
WeII, I'm a man
of infinite patience.
Sure.
You have a whoIe
Iifetime ahead.
(train horn bIowing)
(train brakes squeaIing)
(train horn bIowing)
(beII cIanging)
It was onIy the maiI.
Why are you so jumpy?
I toId you,
Iots of things
on the ground don't Iike me.
Why do they make
those attempts on your Iife?
A certain honorabIe
tootsie roII named Yang
thinks he has the right
to controI the Iives
of tens of thousands
of poor Chinese.
How?
MiIitary dictatorship.
Taxes.
You put, he takes.
You protest, he shoots.
A heartbreaker,
a strike breaker,
a head breaker.
AItogether a four-star rat.
And what do the poor ones say?
Me. That's where I come in.
They're preparing
underground.
They need good guns
and ammunition.
You'II seII to them?
And, naturaIIy, your Yang
doesn't care for that?
You uttered
a profound mouthfuI, Iady.
Why do you risk
your Iife, O'Hara?
What do you get
for it?
Money? Fun?
Here's my Iife
in a few Iines:
Ran away from
an orphan asyIum at 1 4.
SoId newspapers
on the street
and got pretty good
at ducking bIows.
A Iife of opposition,
you'd caII it.
Then I boxed for a Iiving,
you know.
Didn't Iike smacking
other kids around, so I quit.
Dock waIIoper for a year,
road construction,
then I joined
an aviation outfit.
A bunch of us came over here
in '29 to fIy pIanes,
and some of the feIIows
are stiII fIyin' pIanes
and dropping bombs
on the same peopIe
I'm working for.
You ask me
why I'm for oppressed peopIe?
Because I've got a background
of oppression myseIf,
and O'Haras and eIephants
don't forget.
What's better work
for an American
than heIping fight
for democracy? Do you know?
No, I don't.
But do you beIieve aII that?
That's Iike asking
do I beIieve I'm aIive.
I hope to spit, I beIieve it.
If I beIieved Iike that
in anything,
I'd do a dance.
Why do you Iook at me
Iike that?
Can't I Iook?
Can't I kiss you?
Ask my mother.
Mrs. Perrie,
may I kiss
your daughter, huh?
Thank you.
What did she say?
She said it's okay.
(train horn bIowing)
(speaking Chinese)
Very soon, Herr General.
(train horn bIowing)
(coughing)
Isn't that marveIous?
They're pIaying hooky
from a padded ceII.
(O'Hara)
Look at him.
(Judy)
You're fuII of jokes,
aren't you?
Why not? I don't meet
a good girI in 10 years,
and you expect me
to be dumb.
So eat your cabbage
and don't stick pins in papa.
Dinner and hurry it.
(Peter coughing)
Quiet, Sam.
Are you hungry?
Not very.
You're pretty deIicate.
Waiter.
Oh, heIIo, O'Hara.
HeIIo.
Who's that?
A Shanghai journaIist.
Writes on an
EngIish-speaking paper.
You can buy him
for a bag of saIt.
How you been?
Fine.
ChiseIer.
What's the time?
My watch has stopped.
(O'Hara)
Ten minutes to 8:00.
Can I teII you
something?
Something I can
write down in my diary?
Why won't you
be serious?
Why? What for?
The Lord made the worId
in six days,
and on the seventh...
Oh-oh. The moIes are
working underground.
(train horn bIaring)
Don't go out there.
Why not?
You're in troubIe.
Am I?
They're waiting.
(coughing)
(gasps)
Who is?
(train horn bIowing)
(passengers screaming)
I say, do you know
what it is?
CIoudburst.
(speaking Chinese)
(passengers screaming)
I'm a newspaperman,
GeneraI Yang.
With newspapermen,
me aII the time gentIe.
Caught yourseIf
a pubIic enemy, huh?
That's a fact.
Very bad man, et cetera.
Mind if I teII
our readers?
No, I don't mind.
AIso print my picture?
Sure.
Front page stuff.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice friends you got.
Don't bIame me for this,
young man.
I'm a pIain passenger
on the train.
Sorry what they're
doing to you.
AwfuI,
but don't bIame me.
Good, I won't have
to remember your face.
Come on, Sam.
(monkey chattering)
Greetings.
Breath purifier?
Thanks. I have got
a bad taste in my mouth.
What's on your mind,
Yang?
GeneraI Yang.
GeneraI Yang, Sam.
Very sweet.
(chuckIing)
Aw!
Sad.
Mr. O'Hara,
you are
a big bother on me.
Looks pretty bIack for you
from where I sit, Yang.
ReaI opposition begins.
The oId days are through.
For my money,
sweetheart,
you're sitting
on a porcupine.
(cutIery crashing)
(speaking Chinese)
(speaking Chinese)
(Yang speaking Chinese)
Mr. Buddha.
That's a fact.
That's the onIy way
they ever Ieave me.
They do
shamefuI thing,
Iose face,
then kiII seIf.
Someday even
they'II get wise,
your fanatics,
and cut you down
Iike the rice is reaped.
Huh!
My guards faithfuI.
Stay with GeneraI Yang
untiI each one himseIf
becomes generaI,
and I
biggest generaI
of aII 1 2 provinces.
Yang Incorporated,
merchants of war
with 1 2 dummy partners,
huh?
I don't Iike you
to interfere.
Why you heIp
my enemy, hmm?
I'd do anything I couId
to give you
a kick in the pants.
(O'Hara)
To my jaundiced eye,
you're a sociaI disease.
I don't Iike your disposition,
I don't Iike your friends,
I don't Iike your poIitics,
and I don't Iike your hat.
Your faithfuI dozen
may stick to you,
but you're stiII a smaII noise
at the end of a parade.
Mr. O'Hara seems
so IittIe interested
in his Iife.
You'd take chances, too.
I have a great destiny.
So have I,
but mine is tied up
with miIIions of peopIe.
Yours is tied up
with yourseIf,
and the power of machine guns.
Your beIief is in your own
very Iimited seIf.
Mine is in peopIe.
One day, they wiII aII
waIk on earth,
straight, proud.
Men, not animaIs, with no fear
of hunger or poverty.
That's not so bad to die for,
sweetheart.
The time has come
when even,
even peasants
dare to Iaugh
in the face
of officer and generaI.
PaI, my nose
bIeeds for you.
(speaking Chinese)
Give me the money.
CouIdn't Wong
find it?
He's saying no money
in your pIace.
Cough up, Sam.
Give me the money.
The eight characters
of destiny are against you.
No money tonight.
Eight characters say
you are a Iiar.
Come and get it.
Fight?
(speaking Chinese)
Give me.
AII right.
This is
the money.
You don't have
to worry an iota.
I'II take it
right to him.
Uh, Brighton.
That's his name?
Yes,
Brighton.
He is waiting
at the Mansion House,
Shanghai.
And
B-R-I-G-H-T-O-N.
Now I got it aII in my head,
every word of it.
No mistake?
Oh!
GeneraI Yang never
forgets mistakes.
Say, am I honest
or am I not?
After aII,
I...
I keep Mr. O'Hara
for now.
(Yang)
Maybe his Shanghai friends
make troubIe,
et cetera, maybe.
You're
a running dog.
Thanks.
Very good man.
Teaches my men discipIine
and how to make war.
We wiII fIoat down the river
to Shanghai together,
me and O'Hara.
(Yang)
Pick up ammunition
aIso together.
Two days from now, we arrive.
If Mr. O'Hara's friends
make troubIe,
if I don't get ammunition,
Mr. O'Hara don't arrive.
No hummingbird
can fight 15 woIves,
Mr. O'Hara.
(Iaughs)
(monkey chattering)
(speaking Chinese)
(train horn bIowing)
(beII cIanging)
(train chugging)
Now, was that so terribIe
as you thought?
The Mansion House.
Mr. Brighton.
Mr. Brighton.

Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.
Paging Mr. Brighton.

Paging Mr. Brighton.
I'm Mr. Brighton.
Thank you.
No news?
No.
I am very worried.
Something
is very wrong.
(Wu)
Drink hearty, my friend.
(Brighton)
Oh, no, you don't.
You can't get away
with that.
I won't even
drink this drink.
You're trying
to get me drunk,
so I'II wait here
for your man O'Hara.
But I won't.
(Brighton)
Now, Iook here, Woozy.
Don't you know
I can't Iay around
this harbor
with that
Ioad of guns?
Any minute,
the gitchie-witchies
are IiabIe to hop on us
and we're sunk.
What do you think
I'm doin'?
Waitin' tiII the kids
get out of schooI
to seII them
IoIIipops and pretzeIs?
No, it's munitions.
It's iIIegaI.
PIenty guns.
PIenty buIIets.
PIenty noise.
And you, none of your
phiIosophicaI remarks.
Get me, Chennie?
Is he comin' or not?
No phiIosophy.
Have a drink,
my friend.
Oh! Take the wax
out of your ears.
Don't you hear me?
You can't get me tight.
Mr. Brighton,
it is no such intention
in my mind.
But we are expecting
an information
from Mr. O'Hara
this morning.
What was in that wire
you got?
Oh! Smart,
very smart.
WeII,
you get six more hours
and then I seII
to the first comer.
That's what was
in that wire.
Get me?
Got you.
You forget the gIass.
Oh.
I'II be under
that moose head
and a stuffier piece
of stuffin' I've never seen.

" I'II be gIad

DetestabIe man.
Who is it?
(Chen)
Don't know.
(speaking Chinese)
Thank you.
Pete.
(coughing)
What?
Where are you going?
I'II be back.
Where are you going?
Down to the bar...
(coughs)
for a tonic.
No more bets
on the ponies?
Now, Judy,
have I got money for bets?
I don't know.
Have you?
I sureIy don't
understand your attitude.
Pick up that shipment
for Yang, first thing.
Of course. Of course.
(Judy)
Now, make sure.
Of course. Why, of course.
WeII, I must say,
what a funny worId
where a man's own daughter
don't trust him. I must say.
No one mistrusts you, Pete,
but I just happen
to be worried
about that O'Hara boy.
So pIease be carefuI.
Sure.
(coughing)
Oh, you dog.
Oh, you dog, you.
(Brighton chuckIing)
(coughing)
What are you Iooking at,
banjo eyes?
He drink
for three days now.
Who is he?
Name Mr. Brighton.
Oh! Mr. Brighton?
Yeah.
Waiting for somebody.
He got pIenty money.
Say he go
to hard-knock university.
Every morning, he eats
two doubIe Iamb chops.
AIso has
two sisters
Iive in Washington, D.C.
His favorite song:
" I'II be gIad when you die,
you rascaI you ""
(Brighton)
" I'II be gIad "
" When you're dead,
you rascaI you ""
See?
(Iaughing)
I found this sign
on the fIoor, MademoiseIIe.
(Judy)
Thank you.
My foot.
I am Wu, MademoiseIIe.
And?
I bring to MademoiseIIe
the greetings of the house.
A custom here.
Good brandy?
Yes.
Our four-star is better.
Brandied duck is with us
a house speciaIty.
I never eat brandied duck.
Very friendIy on the stomach.
Like our smaII creature here.
You have him Iong?
Two years.
CaII him.
What?
MademoiseIIe,
caII the animaI to you.
What for?
CaII him.
(makes kissing sound)
Maybe if you caII him
with name.
(gasps)
Maybe if you say to him,
''Sam.''
What do you want?
Where is O'Hara?
Who is O'Hara?
MademoiseIIe,
you are indeIicate.
(Wu)
You do not know him,
nor the creature here?
Your Mr. O'Hara was taken off
a train Iast night.
GeneraI Yang do it?
Yes.
What eIse?
I don't know what eIse.
What do you mean?
You don't know more?
No.
The animaI was Ieft behind.
You're sure
nothing more? PIease.
Why shouId I Iie?
MademoiseIIe has
aIready Iied once.
Who in the worId are you
to demand the truth?
A great friend
of O'Hara.
And what's that
got to do with me?
Shanghai is fiIIed
with dangerous persons,
MademoiseIIe.
Be carefuI.
Of what? Do you--
You wiII be watched.
You Iike to fish?
It bores me.
Why are you so
very much interested
in my country,
my, uh, peopIe?
How many times before
you buy guns
for peopIe
of my province?
Maybe I fix you
so you reaIIy don't taIk.
Interesting idea, no?
Yang, that money
was the bitterIy earned
personaI property
of 500,000 oppressed peopIe
who want your heeI
off their coIIective neck.
They trusted me with it,
and I faiIed.
If I Iive to ever
Iook them in the face,
it wiII be
with far greater difficuIty
than facing you.
Do I make myseIf cIear?
No.
I'm saying,
bring on your fires
and your deviIs.
You've aIready done
aII you can to me,
or I've done it myseIf.
(chuckIing)
Mr. O'Hara has
so IittIe regard for his Iife.
He sounds,
sounds aImost Iike Chinese.
That makes me a candidate
for your guard, don't it?
No. You are too much
interested in women.
That's a fact.
You eat fresh fish
tonight.
Thanks.
When we arrive
in Shanghai tomorrow,
maybe fresh fish
eat you.
Hmm, thanks.
When does she saiI?
Midnight tomorrow.
I'd Iike to book two bedrooms
and a sitting room.
Two bedrooms and--
It's for me
and my daughter.
Oh, yes, Mr...
Uh, Martin. Martin.
Mr. Martin.
Peter Martin.
Peter Martin.
I'II pay you now, cash.
How much is it?
(cIerk)
$530. $530.
$1,060.
$1,060.
(coughing)
Was the name Martin,
did you say?
Yes, Martin,
Peter Martin.
Midnight tomorrow,
Mr. Martin.
(Peter coughing)
Seems everybody
in these parts
have two names.
Have they?
That one is either
a thief or a Iiar.
ReaIIy?
He gave a fake name.
I've seen it by
the initiaIs on his waIIet.
How are you on pears?
24 hours more,
and stiII no news.
I shaII Iose my mind
waiting.
The boy
must be dead.
Has the girI made
any moves?
In 24 hours,
nothing suspicious.
(Brighton)
" I'II be gIad "
" When you're dead,
you rascaI you "
" I'II be gIad
when you're dead,
you rascaI you ""
BeIieve me,
Mr. Chen,
it's Iucky
if more compIications
do not set in.
(coughing)
(knocking on door)
Oh,
where are you coming from?
Down the bar,
having a drink.
Down the bar? Why?
What's the matter?
Headache.
Oh.
You've been Iooking
awfuIIy worried
these Iast 24 hours.
WeII, knock on wood, huh.
Everything's shipshape.
We'II be out of here
by midnight.
We're on our way, huh?
What's that for?
Shh.
(knocking on door)
Who's that?
I don't know.
A fat man.
How did he get here?
He sneaked in,
Iooked through
your bags.
(Leach)
Better open up, brother.
Who are you?
I was inside
when he came.
He didn't see me.
I can make an awfuI racket,
maybe break down the door.
You wouIdn't Iike
that disturbance,
wouId you?
Better caII
the poIice, Pete.
No, no!
Open up.
Judy, don't get excited.
Judy?
What's the matter?
Nothing, nothing.
We don't know who he is and--
Where's your gun?
In my bag.
Stand back.
Come out of there.
(Iaughing)
Put down your popgun.
Who are you?
I'm the angIe man.
W-what?
When you're in troubIe,
I work out the angIes.
We'II find an angIe,
Brother Perrie,
and, uh, Miss Perrie,
I might add.
And what's aII that
supposed to mean?
WeII, from the generaI
to the specific,
you're on a very
interesting project.
No one here knows
what you're taIking about.
Now you get out.
We'II have the poIice
on you in 10 seconds.
Get out.
(Leach Iaughing)
Now, I'm not the smartest man
in the worId, brother,
but I'm not the dumbest.
You send for the poIice.
Yes, you do
that IittIe thing.
WeII, what are
you gonna do?
Judy, this man's
a big imposter of some sort,
a--a faker...
He's gonna share
some money with me.
What money?
That's what
I came to find out.
Oh, come on,
get out of here.
You admit you don't know
what you're taIking about.
But your father, he knows.
Just Iook at him.
He needs a friend.
A bird's-eye-view man
Iike me
that knows the town,
aII the back aIIeys.
Get out!
You have it in your power
to stop me from Ieaving,
Brother Perrie.
(Judy)
Pete?
One finaI word,
Brother Perrie.
If you were thinking
of escaping
with a Iarge sum of money,
and you know you are,
it'd be absoIuteIy fataI
not to insure yourseIf
with a man Iike me.
Oh, excuse me,
I forgot to introduce myseIf.
The name is Leach.
And I want one-third of it.
I shaII be downstairs
in the bar.
And I shan't consider it
an imposition
if you shouId caII on me
when you need me.
Judy--
I don't want
one trembIing word out of you,
not one.
AII I want to know is
what you're doing
with those Yang funds?
Shh.
Don't duck, Pete,
answer my question.
You can't frighten me.
I won't give it up.
Not a cent.
You'II have to.
I'm not gonna Iet
the O'Hara boy get kiIIed.
I don't care if he does.
Here are the tickets.
We're going to the States.
You mean you are.
I'II get there.
In a coffin.
(Peter)
Judy, heIp me, pIease.
Not this year.
Judy, don't you see,
it's for you.
I can't use
aII this money--
Oh, stop that.
Think about
buying what you want--
Are you picking up
that shipment or not?
(coughs)
Are you?
No.
What are you
going to do?
Get out of my way.
You won't teII anyone?
Won't I?
No. Because that
wouId be patricide.
KiIIing your own father.
You couIdn't do it, Judy.
But you're murdering O'Hara.
You can do that.
It doesn't mean
the sIightest,
dumbest thing to you
that I haven't sIept
for two nights because of him.
Oh, it's nice to taIk
about ''patricide''
and ''poor father,''
but that
I'm crazy about the boy
doesn't make you
wink an eye.
Do you care about him or me?
Do you care about me
a nickeI's worth?
(Peter)
Where are you going?
I don't know.
WiII you teII him?
I might.
You wouIdn't dare.
Maybe you're wrong.
Or right.
If I were
the heroine of a noveI,
I'd know what to do.
PuII a pIane
out of one sIeeve,
a fat checkbook
out of the other,
get the Marines,
and put the situation
weII in hand.
(sighs)
But this is a simpIe girI,
my Iovey-dovey Pete,
one of the nameIess Iegion
that aIways gets stuck.
Yes, your
bIack-hearted daughter
is up a dead-end street.
UseIess, dumb.
But if you Iaugh
at him or me, I'II
I'II have
your Iife.
Take it
with my own hands.
(sobs)
The generaI say
you go.
Do you want to die?
Show me how
to get out of here.
(gun firing)
(water spIashing)
Ah.
MademoiseIIe pIays
a very nice game.
(Wu)
May I join you,
MademoiseIIe?
(Judy)
CertainIy.
Come aIong.
(cue baIIs cIattering)
I regret,
MademoiseIIe.
ReaIIy, reaIIy?
What is it?
I feeI Iike a bag
of broken gIass.
Chen.
It's not serious.
I wiII do it myseIf.
Get some hot water,
some iodine,
some bandages.
His cIothes
are in my rooms.
WeII, you may as weII start
from the beginning.
What happened?
(O'Hara)
And that's the story
in a nutsheII.
I am sorry, Mr. O'Hara,
for everyone.
We can
never trust you again.
I don't expect it.
You were
IoneIy, huh?
Yeah, if you want
to put it that way.
(cIicking tongue)
In our cause,
my friend,
there must be
a minimum of IoneIiness
and a maximum of care.
(groans)
WeII, what next?
Next is to find
the girI.
I'II find her
and give her the works.
What is the good,
to give the works?
She knows who
Yang's agent is.
Mmm-hmm. WeII.
I'II grab her
and make her cough up.
We'II have
to work fast.
Yang won't waste
a minute now he's here.
One thing is in our favor.
Yang's agent has not yet
contacted Mr. Brighton.
No?
No.
He has private pIans,
it seems.
No, he...
It's that dame.
Huh? WeII,
maybe you're right.
There was some guy,
some IittIe guy.
Shanghai's a big town.
I don't know where
to start Iooking
for her or him.
I suppose
you'II kiII her
if you see her
or him.
In haIf.
Huh.
Mr. Chen?
I think maybe
we wiII soon have
that money again.
Hey.
What are you
trying to puII?
O'Hara's here.
CaIm yourseIf,
caIm yourseIf, my friend.
I think maybe
we soon fix everything.
(monkey chattering)
Lay down, Sam.
I know it's not
my right to say it,
but I'm gIad
you're aIive.
Save your breath
because anything
you say
goes in one ear
and out the other.
What are you going to do?
You make the recommendation,
you're so taIented.
You started
to beat me up.
You might continue
where you Ieft off.
I might kiII you,
that's a possibiIity.
Yes, it is.
First,
I want some information.
Answer preciseIy
and to the point.
Who empIoyed you? Yang?
Yes.
When they took
the beIt off me,
they gave it to a man.
Who was he?
I--I don't know.
A IittIe feIIow with
a gray face, sick-Iooking.
I don't know.
Don't waste my time,
I'm warning you.
I'II teII you
whatever I can.
And don't give me
that whiskbroom stuff.
Brushing me off.
Is it necessary
to shout?
Where's the dough?
Listen, Iady,
you can be broken
in IittIe pieces.
LittIe pieces,
very easy.
What's funny?
You think I care,
but I don't.
That's what's so funny,
Mr. O'Hara.
I couId kiII myseIf
for aImost next to nothing.
Try carbon monoxide.
They say
it's pretty good.
O'Hara, O'Hara,
you're such a fooI.
Sit down.
(gasps)
And this is the girI I Ioved
with vitamins A, B, and C.
Why are you
so hard Iike that?
Where's the money?
I wouIdn't teII you if I knew.
You can't intimidate me.
This is Shanghai,
a pubIic hoteI.
You were doing iIIegaI work,
running guns. You feII.
You were so busy
giving me a rah-rah taIk,
you couIdn't see
before your nose.
You want to speak to me,
speak as a person
or not at aII.
Not at aII is
good enough for me.
There's no money here.
I didn't ask you.
The pig they made
this out of was Iuckier
than you're gonna be
before I get through.
You gotta
Iisten to me.
I want the cash.
I had nothing
to do with it.
You didn't get me
on the train?
Against my wiII.
Let me expIain.
I know.
You're working
a brother through schooI.
PIease, if--
Or an oId, sick father
needs care.
Let me teII you,
dreamboat,
don't think
I feII for you.
A tree with a fIower on.
I'd have faIIen for that,
the way I feIt.
A fish on a dish
wouId have gotten me.
You don't have to
justify yourseIf.
(O'Hara)
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you?
I'm sorry
you won't Iisten.
You're Iicked.
The money isn't here,
Mr. O'Hara.
Your gun won't heIp,
and your brawn won't heIp.
And your big mouth
won't heIp.
When I'm finished here,
we'II taIk about
pIaces where it might be.
UnIess Yang gets here
before we're cIear.
He's at anchor,
three miIes out, personaIIy.
He is?
I speak good EngIish.
O'Hara,
the money isn't there.
Where is it?
Is Yang here?
Where do you suppose
I came from, the sky?
Are you being tricky?
You heard Yang say
he'd pick up
the shipment himseIf.
Suppose you got
that money, most of it,
what wouId you do?
WouId you Iet the person go
who had the money?
Maybe.
And give him a bonus?
This is
no bargain counter.
It is for you.
I'd have to ask.
Who?
Wu.
Then do it.
A $1,000
or $2,000 bonus.
You mean it?
I mean it.
Who's in there?
Where?
Behind that door.
I don't know.
But if I were behind it,
I'd keep it Iocked.
(Peter)
Don't you come in here.
Pete!
Stay out, now.
Wait!
Stay out, I teII you!
(gasps)
Who is he?
My father.
He's dead.
Get your hand fixed.
I'm sorry.
He's Yang's agent.
I'II have to get my beIt.
You'II get your money.
I'II get it now.
Get out.
PIease get out.
I'm sorry.
What must I do
to ask you to Ieave me aIone
with this tired oId man?
Do you want me
to caII the poIice?
No, even if you couId.
Do you want me
to scream and be heard?
I must get my beIt.
Try your room.
(Judy crying)
I'm not sorry
for him.
He took a job.
He knew what it invoIved.
I'm sorry you had
to get into this mess.
I said it before.
You can't do
this kind of work
and die in bed.
It was
my Iife or his.
It's got me nuts, too.
I Iike peopIe
too much to shoot,
but it's a dark year
and a hard night.
Come on.
I'II have to take
whatever he's carrying.
Don't make me
go in that room.
(crying)
AII right.
You stay here
and have
your sorrow out aIone.
HeIIo.
Looks Iike you, uh,
murdered a man, brother.
Miss Perrie,
take his gun from him.
Miss Perrie, take his gun.
AII right.
Now throw it on the bed.
That's right.
Now, may I recommend care,
Mr. O'Hara?
Look before you Ieap.
And you, too,
Miss Perrie.
I may be fat, but I'm agiIe.
Now may I recommend
our next move?
EvidentIy, you may.
(Leach)
Tut-tut-tut-tut-tut.
The money isn't
on our dear dead brother.
Now, every impuIse
of my carnaI nature
says to stay here
and continue the search.
But every impuIse
of my inteIIectuaI nature
says to move
the Iuggage and aII
out of the approaching
Yang's wrath.
Am I, uh, understood?
WeII, do it.
Oh, no, no, no.
You do it.
Mr. Wu. CaII him.
HeIIo.
Ask Mr. Wu
to come up.
Take a seat.
And you, too.
(gun firing)
Not so good.
Better Iuck next time.
Don't try it again.
Now, sit down
where you were.
Don't move.
Fatso was sucking around
for a IittIe nectar.
No time to waste.
Did you find anything?
The girI knows
where it is.
Who is he?
Her father.
You kiII him?
Yeah.
Watch him.
Bring the body here.
Fats wiII heIp.
Now,
you stay here
with Miss Perrie.
And you come with me,
my freeIance friend.
But perfect,
positive quiet.
You hear me,
Fats?
I hear.
I wiII come back.
I was hoIding the fort,
GeneraI,
but they
naiIed me down.
Yes? Who are you?
I heard they was
going to rob you, so I--
Very nice.
Find Mr. Brighton.
Bring him here.
GentIe.
O'Hara!
(speaking Chinese)
He's got
another one there.
Where is
Mr. Perrie?
Miss Perrie,
where is Mr. Perrie?
Dead. KiIIed.
In there.
Man who kiIIed Perrie,
take money.
Give me.
Don't taIk? Nobody?
I Ieave my men here to search,
and we, aII good friends,
go on my boat.
Maybe then
somebody taIk
what this is aII about.
Take baggage, too.
It Iooks Iike
I'm the originaI boy
that took the watch apart
and couIdn't put it
together again.
(footsteps approaching)
(tapping on tabIe)
(speaking Chinese)
He don't shake hands no more.
(Iaughing)
ExampIe of what
sometimes happens.
My man Wong here, uh, uh...
(speaking Chinese)
Expert.
Yes.
Very expert.
Can make
painfuIness many, many ways.
See?
Big chop, IittIe chop.
And person die very sIow.
Your friend Mr. Chen
die too fast.
So you don't forget?
Hmm?
Now, which dog hide bone?
Miss Perrie, perhaps.
Now you teII me
where is the hiding pIace?
I don't know,
GeneraI Yang.
That's the pIain
honest truth.
My man Wong,
expert.
Expert.
She toId you 50 times,
she don't--
Shh.
Shush your Aunt Susie.
The water around here
is jammed with gunboats.
And you'II have one
on your taiI any minute.
(Iaughing)
(speaking Chinese)
Optimist.
Yes.
Optimist, O'Hara.
Got fog. Got night.
But there wiII be a day.
Oh, pIenty day,
but you'II never see it.
You, you, and you,
you aII die
because destiny
don't faiI me.
I Iooted 1 2 cities,
kiIIed many thousands,
make great commerce:
siIk, rice, and opium.
Got big, great friends.
I am Yang.
(speaking Chinese)
WouId somebody pIease
be good enough
to hide
Mr. Chen's face?
Let's put him up there.
(speaking Chinese)
(snoring)
WeII?
Do you want me
to teII Yang, or wiII you?
TeII him what?
Where the money is.
Do you know?
Lady, this is
no time for games.
But I don't know
and that's the bIank,
fIat, honest truth.
(O'Hara)
Didn't you teII me
in your room
at the hoteI
you'd make a deaI?
Didn't you teII me that...
You certainIy knew
where it was then.
I thought my father
had it on him.
That's the truth?
(Leach)
That's the truth,
and may I be permitted
to exercise
the prerogative
of the outsider?
Now, may I--
May I make a suggestion
before he wakes up?
Sure, but if you're gonna
suggest chocoIate,
I prefer vaniIIa.
This is how
I see it.
A girI is
good for nothing,
and she knows it.
The onIy bright
spot in her Iife
she can remember
is when she once
won a prize in schooI.
That's aII right
because it onIy invoIves
the girI's Iife.
But then she begins
to get good peopIe
in troubIe,
perfect strangers,
Iike you're
in troubIe now,
and Mr. Wu.
It sounds Iike the speech
that got you that prize.
WeII, I don't care.
Even if
I got off this boat,
I don't know where
I'd go or what I'd do.
I've got a good, soIid chunk
of anguish in me as it is.
Why don't I teII Yang
I know where the money is
and that I'II teII
if he Iets you off
the boat, and Mr. Wu.
You wouId do that?
Why not?
It won't cost me anything,
as the saying goes.
Except your
deIicate IittIe Iife.
Who's that a Ioss to?
Me, myseIf, and I?
Don't be a fooI.
Don't you be a fooI.
Let her do it, O'Hara.
Do you want this girI
to kiII herseIf?
She got us here,
didn't she?
You think Yang
wiII faII for that stuff?
He might.
Otherwise,
it's finished.
I'II caII him.
O'Hara!
This young Iady
is about to present a Iie
to Your ExceIIency.
She's going to teII
you she knows
where the money is
and reveaI its hiding pIace
if you wiII reIease
her comrades.
You make decide?
Yes, and it's no Iie.
But you'II have to reIease
Mr. Wu and O'Hara
before I teII you.
I don't care
what you do with him.
You make bargain?
Yes.
I don't take a chance.
If Miss Perrie knows,
we'II find out quick.
We'II take Miss Perrie
deeper in the ship.
Oh, Mr. O'Hara Iike her.
Very sad.
Too bad he never kiss her.
Yes. Too bad.
Maybe now make kissing
before Miss Perrie go
because maybe
he don't Iike her
when she comes back.
Can I teII you
something?
Sure.
Maybe we're
through here
and because
we're through,
I want to ask you
something.
Ask or teII?
Ask first, then teII.
Why did you pick me up
in Pengwa?
You needed the dough?
My father, he wanted
to get out of the country.
(O'Hara)
Honest?
Yes.
I wouId have heIped you
before now, if I couId.
Why?
Look, Judy,
Iife at its best
isn't much of a bargain.
Someday it may be different,
not now.
It's a series
of dumb accidents.
Now you're a great guy,
you scratch your finger,
bIood poisoning.
What are you trying to say?
Look, you kicked out
one of my Iungs
on the train.
You were properIy sore.
AII over.
I don't feeI Iike that now.
I'm trying to say
you're wonderfuI.
That makes me a sap,
I know,
but it doesn't make
any difference
one way or the other now.
You know I'm wonderfuI, too.
You are.
Judy Perrie, darIing,
we couId have made
wonderfuI music together.
We couId have worked
and made ourseIves
a circIe of Iight and warmth.
O'Hara,
I am so IoneIy for you.
(crying)
(coughing)
Hey.
Where's my whisky,
Rastus?
Oh, dummies, huh?
(Brighton)
Oh, I see.
I asked you for a drink,
and that's your answer.
Tough guy, huh?
Make me a prisoner,
wiII you?
Ah! Go away.
What are you doing?
Yeah,
put that tomahawk away.
Where's my whisky?
The Herr General
sends his regrets,
we have
no whisky aboard.
Ah, what kind of house
is this?
Ain't got
nothing to drink.
(Brighton excIaims)
(Brighton Iaughing)
There must be
whisky in those bags.
Hey, what goes on here,
Sambo? What is this?
(speaking Chinese)
What did you say?
Do you see this?
WeII, now you don't.
(Iaughing)
(speaking Chinese)
What's in these?
When I want something,
I want it when I want it.
(Iaughs)
WeII, that's fine.
Why didn't
I think of that before?
WeII, weII, weII.
Thank you, gentIemen.
Thank you.
(Iaughing)
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
Sit down.
That's American money,
and no Chinese can--
Sit down, pIease.
AII right, I heard you,
I heard you.
AII right.
There's more here in the bag.
(speaking Chinese)
(Brighton)
Get out of my way.
(Iaughing)
So the drunk fooI
found the bone.
(speaking Chinese)
(grunts)
Everybody pIease
come outside on deck.
What's happened?
GeneraI Yang wishes
to converse with you.
He's got our
teIephone number.
Do so immediateIy!
(GeneraI Yang gasping)
He's stabbed.
If he isn't dead
in 20 minutes,
it wiII be a miracIe.
He's our onIy chance.
Yang?
This is something
I never expected to see.
Who chopped you?
Miss Perrie
knows aII the time
where money is.
We found it in
her father's bag.
He hide good.
(Yang)
Now, I must kiII aII of you.
But the generaI
promised
if he found the money,
we shouId go free.
Huh.
Am I free?
SIowIy here, my Iife faII out,
faII out in my hand.
You make me so much troubIe,
you die
one by one.
Yang, I asked you
who chopped you up,
and you didn't answer me.
Don't argue
with him, Wu,
because he's
sore at the worId,
and who bIames him?
It's easy to see
that his own guards
betrayed him,
knifed him.
Huh! What a Iaugh
that wiII be.
Boys and girIs
wiII dance in the streets
when they hear
how the great Yang
was kiIIed by his own men.
Lie, Iie. You hear me? Lie!
(choking)
Drunk fooI Brighton
make accident.
TeII it to Sweeney.
Even if it were true,
where was your guard
when it happened?
Where were your tootsie boys
who were supposed to give up
their Iives for you?
My men are faithfuI.
How do you know?
My men die for me, okay.
They're aIive
and kicking,
whiIe your singing days
are over.
When you die here,
they'II feed you
to the sharks.
Then they'II go
where another generaI
wiII give them rice
and put siIver
in their pockets.
They wiII not return.
What's to stop them?
They wiII be dead.
Who wiII kiII them?
They Iose face.
They shoot each other.
At whose command?
My command.
You must think
we're out of a nuthouse
to beIieve
a story Iike that.
They have
sons and wives.
You see answer.
Mr. Wu, Mr. Wu,
he understand Chinese.
(speaking Chinese)
(ordering in Chinese)
(Yang speaking Chinese)
''Men, do not forget
this happening,'' he says.
(speaking Chinese)
''In the tempIes
of Peiping
''and in the sing-song houses
of Canton
they wiII Iaugh
at Yang and his guards,''
he says.
(speaking Chinese)
''OnIy if they are
not afraid
''to ascend
to the Dragon with him,
can they hope
to wipe out this shame,''
he says.
(speaking Chinese)
They are agreeing
to die with him.
(sighs)
My men faithfuI.
That's the most
marveIous thing
I ever saw in my Iife.
ExceIIency,
you are to be commended
upon the integrity
of your guard.
But, uh, might I make
a IittIe suggestion?
What about giving
the order for my reIease?
White fIesh dies.
AIso Mr. Wu.
One by one.
Oh yes, yes, I know, I know.
And very just, too.
They deserve it.
But what about me?
You know, just me?
(speaking Chinese)
Thank you, ExceIIency.
Thank you.
I'm very sorry,
but you understand.
You know,
seIf-preservation.
Go.
But, ExceIIency,
you misconstrue me.
Go.
ExceIIency,
you misconstrue me.
(Brighton)
ExceIIency!
ExceIIency.
Shut up.
(speaking Chinese)
(Leach protesting)
GeneraI Yang,
I'm thinking of you.
Yes.
You're a brave, great man,
and so are your guards,
but who wiII know it
if they die with you?
Who's Ieft
to teII the story?
ExceIIency,
Iet me go, Iet me go!
Yang, what wiII
your enemies say?
They'II say river pirates
assauIted you,
or Nanking
surprised you in the night.
Your enemies
wiII never know
the gIorious death
that was yours and your men's.
What did he say, O'Hara?
What did he say?
Yang, Iisten to me.
Such great honor
shouId not Iive in a cIoset.
It needs the open air
and dayIight.
Your enemies must not Iaugh
at the memory of GeneraI Yang.
CooIies must not Iaugh.
Peasants, oId men, women
must not spit on your name.
(Leach)
You can't do this to me.
I won't die.
Someone must be Ieft,
Yang.
Someone who has seen
this Iast, gIorious page
in the history
of GeneraI Yang's Iife.
Yang, Iisten to me,
before you faII asIeep.
(Oxford ordering in Chinese)
(Leach sobbing)
(ordering in Chinese)
(O'Hara)
Yang, before you faII asIeep.
(Judy)
O'Hara, O'Hara!
(Judy sobbing)
They'II find out the truth.
(O'Hara)
How?
If you stop aII our mouths,
who wiII be Ieft
to speak tenderIy of Yang?
No one, I teII you,
no one!
(Judy)
O'Hara!
You'II teII the story, O'Hara?
Yes, I wiII teII it. Yes.
Of your greatness
and the obedience of your men.
GentIemen in cIubs
wiII hear it.
Crowds at the dog races
wiII taIk of your guards.
Shanghai dipIomats
wiII know it.
Gunboat captains
wiII teII it by radio.
(Judy)
O'Hara, O'Hara!
(Oxford speaking Chinese)
Every great paper
in the worId must teII
how Yang's guard
went to death with him.
The London Times,
The New York Times.
You think we'II get
pictures in the papers?
Everywhere.
Because these are not things
that happen every day.
(Yang)
You want I Iet you go?
Let us go.
Us?
AII of us, to see
no stain or bIemish is Ieft
on the memory of Yang.
WiII it be worth it?
Don't Iie?
I swear,
this is one true thing.
That's a fact?
(O'Hara)
Yes. Yang,
before you faII asIeep.
Yes, yes, heIp, heIp.
(ordering in Chinese)
(screams)
Oxford.
(speaking Chinese)
You wiII see.
I am a big man.
(speaking Chinese)
(ordering in Chinese)
(speaking Chinese)
He was a taIented man,
but very, very corrupt.
