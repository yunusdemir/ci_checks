There are ballads
that are sad
About a lassie
and a lad
There are songs about our
heroes and their glories
But I'd like
to have you hear
About a girl
so sweet and dear
So listen to
my sentimental story
My cousin, Agnes Klung,
left home when she was young
I'll tell you how it happened
Let me think
She was cute and pretty too
Her eyes were oh, so blue
But a single cocktail
made poor Agnes wink
It's not funny as you think
when a gal has got to wink
Every time she has
a little drink or two
One day she got a jug
and she drank it all, ga-lug
And she said good-bye and left
us in a stew-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Well, she got to the city
She was just a little giddy
She asked a fella
how to get around
She said "Don't think that I am
fresh but can you tell me an address
Where I can go 'cause
I don't know my way in town"
Now the feller was a gent
He knew just what Agnes meant
That is until
he saw her start to wink
And then he believed and knew
exactly what a guy should do
So he suggested that they both
should have a drink
Well, he took her by the hand and
then Agnes said, "Ooh, this is grand
"But, mister, I'm afraid
you made a big mistake
"If you'll just be kind enough
I'd like to stop this silly stuff
Liberties you're not allowed
to take"
Now the feller didn't know
about her winkin' eye and so
He couldn't figure out
what was the score
So he took her out to eat and
to a show right down the street
And he asked her if she'd
care for something more
Agnes said, "I think you're
swell but will you find me a hotel
"Where I can go and not
be bothered by the men
"I'm a long, long way from
home and I wanna be alone
But perhaps I'll see you
sometime soon again"
Now our Agnes wasn't dumb but
back home where she came from
She never learned
the value of her wink
In the city she got wise
Learned to use her winkin' eyes
Now our Agnes
does her drinkin'
In a mink
Imagine a kid from the Kentucky hills
doing that to the cream of cafe's society.
Who's her agent? I am. I know talent when
I see it. Only good act you brought me.
You haven't seen anything yet. Wait 'til
you see what I've got for you tonight.
Now look here, I don't... Don't worry
about a thing. Don't worry about a thing.
Just a minute, friends.
Just a minute.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight is a special
attraction we present for your amazement...
Just because he's your agent doesn't mean he
can bring any broken down act into this place.
Oh, give him a chance. He has
to get work for his clients...
in order to pay me the money
he borrows to feed them.
<i>In the annals of the theater,
we've had many great escape artists.</i>
You've heard of the Great Houdini,
Great Bronson, the Great Herman.
Now comes
the Great Wilbert!
Professor,
a chord, please.
And now the Great Wilbert will
perform his greatest escape.
Music, maestro.
Now, if some kind person from the
audience will step on the stage...
and chain him up,
anyone at all?
<i>Aw, come on,
anyone?</i>
<i>Don't be bashful.
Step right up on the stage.</i>
<i>- You know, it's a honor to
work with the Great Wilbert.</i>
There's the one...
<i>Pardon me, uh...
Wilbert, Wilbert?</i>
Hey, come on.
None of that.
Outside please, girls. Now, will
some kind person please step up?
<i>Anyone?
How about you gentlemen?</i>
Do you think
I can do this?
Just remember what I taught you.
I'll slip you the master key.
Keep it in your mouth. When I pull
the drapes, open the locks and escape.
Come right up here.
There you are, boys.
Now, tie him. Tie him up as tight
as you can. That's the spirit.
<i>That's it.
That's it, boys.</i>
The Great Wilbert will get
out! I promise you he will.
<i>That's the spirit, boys. That's the way
the Wilbert works,: the Great Wilbert.</i>
<i>Yes. Make it tight.
Make it tight. Well, well.</i>
We finally found some gentlemen
who really know their business.
<i>Oh, 38? Hmm.</i>
Look at him!
Take it! Ooh, you!
Now, now... Hey, hey! Go ahead,
complete tying him. Would you...
I'll kill both of'em. Oh,
watch your blood pressure.
<i>You got him?
There we are.</i>
Let him get out of that. I...
Here's the key. Open your mouth. Open up!
Good luck, boy.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, the Great
Wilbert, in a matter of a few seconds,
will shed his bonds
like a snake sheds its skin.
A drum roll,
maestro.
<i>And here we have...
Here we have...</i>
Fooled ya that time,
didn't I?
Well, uh, can't make
a trick look too easy.
Now, in, uh,
a matter of minutes,
<i>the Great Wilbert will
perform his greatest escape.!</i>
And here we have...
the Great Wilbert.
<i>He's still there.</i>
I'll tell ya what. We'll have a
little contest. Look at your watches.
The one that can guess how long it'll
take the Great Wilbert to get loose,
will be a guest of the house;
now look at your watches.
Guest of the house? I'll make those guy's
guests of the hospital. Get out and sing.
In the hills ofTennessee
lives a family named McGee
<i>They've really got a problem
on their mind</i>
<i>For their daughter, Mary-Ann
just can't find herself a man</i>
<i>She ain't even been
nobody's valentine</i>
<i>Theyjust can't figure out
why some feller roundabout</i>
<i>Ain't askin'Mary-Ann
to be his wife</i>
- Oooh!
- She'll soon be lookin' old
And she'll likely be
an old maid all her life
<i>Oh, why don't someone
marry Mary-Ann</i>
<i>No gal can shoot a rifle
like she can</i>
And what fills her
with dismay
- She'll be 12
this Groundhog Day
- Oh, why won't someone
marry Mary-Ann
<i>Whoa-Whoa.!</i>
<i>And there he is!
There he is.</i>
A mouse! A mouse!
A mouse!
A mouse? Where? Where?
I'll blow his brains out!
This is the last time you bring an
act in here! You've ruined my show.
Say, where did you learn
that yell? Oh, the yell.
<i>Oh, the yell. My grandpappy. He taught me to
yell like that every time I get in trouble.</i>
I thought you looked familiar. You
must be a McCoy. That's our clan yell.
Well, take your clan and yell outside!
You're through yelling here too.
I'm sorry
I got you fired.
Furthermore though, I really don't belong
to the McCoy clan. My name is Wilbert Smith.
Wait a minute.
Suppose he was a McCoy?
If his grandpa is who I think he is,
he may be worth millions. Millions?
Yes. Millions. I'm your
agent; I get ten percent.
Ten percent of millions. Uh-uh. Excuse me.
I mean, after all, who did you
sign a contract with? Wilbert Smith.
Hiya, stranger. Shake
hands with a McCoy. Hey!
Just don't raise your hand... Hey!
That's my grandpappy
on the bottom.
Well, that's Squeeze Box McCoy. Why,
he's even playing his concertina.
Looks like I found
myself a new cousin. Uh...
Ohhh. I was never cousins before
with a beautiful girl like this.
How do you figure he's
coming into a million dollars?
Well, except for me, Squeeze Box is the
only member of the clan who left the hills.
Oh, no. There must be some mistake.
All my grandpappy ever left me was a fur
cap and a concertina. That's all. No money.
Then why all
the excitement?
Well, somewhere in the hills of
Kentucky, there's a buried treasure.
And my Great Granny McCoy said
that it would only be discovered...
<i>when a Squeeze Box
McCoy returned.</i>
<i>Now, if Wilbert went back with this
picture... And this concertina and fur cap.</i>
Hey. Then they would think
he's the real McCoy.
With all that evidence, Granny might give you
the secret. I forgot to tell you one thing.
Grandpappy also left me this
old gun. No! It's apt to go off.
Oh, no, it ain't loaded.
Look. Ah, will you stop that!
Why don't you look
where you're going?
Why do I have to walk through the
wilderness? Why don't they have roads?
Now, stop complaining. Dorothy's taking
a short cut. Go pick up the grips.
Pick up the grips!
You know, I've never been
in the country before.
Ah, smell that
Kentucky bluegrass.
If grass smells like this,
no wonder it's blue.
Oh, Kentucky. Kentucky: where they
raise the fastest horses in the world.
There must be something in the
air that makes those horses run.
<i>There's something in this air
that would make anybody run.</i>
The birth place of Stephen Foster.
His songs will live forever.
I'm a-comin'
And I'm a-going
Uh-Uh, wait a minute.
I'm comin'
For my head
is bending low
Uh-huh. You smell it? No,
I don't smell anything.
Then your head ain't bending
low enough. I... Wait a minute.
Hey, there's something wrong
with that grip.
Open it up!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Hey, that fur cap, did
that have legs? What?
No. Wait a minute. It has now.
I don't understand.
Whoa!
<i>Whoa-Whoa-whoo.!</i>
Don't yell like that again. This
is Winfield territory. Winfield?
Yes, you see, your grandpappy shot his
first Winfield to revenge a McCoy killing.
Well, that started the feud. One
killing led to another until...
Well, look.
<i>What's that? That's the
Winfield burying ground.</i>
We have to pass through that to reach
McCoy territory. Yes, ma'am. See ya later.
Wha... Come here. Come here.
I don... I just... Come on, come on!
If these guys are all dead, why don't
they lay down? They're only wooden.
That's an old custom
here in the hills. Yeah?
Wood. You'd like to scare
the wits right out of me.
That's Jake Winfield.
"Killed in 1882
by Squeeze Box McCoy. "
You-You mean to tell me that Squeeze
Box McCoy knocked off all these others?
That's right. No-No-No wonder
they had it in for my grandpappy.
And if they ever found out that a
relative of Squeeze Box McCoy's is back,
<i>the whole feud might start
all over again.</i>
Well, in case anyone's listening,
I'm Al Stewart, I'm not a McCoy!
<i>I'm Al Stewart,
I'm not a McCoy.!</i>
<i>I'm Wilbert Smith!
You look like a McCoy.!</i>
That did it.
Get away.
Don't hold me.
Go get your grip.
Oh.
Go ahead!
That real?
Sure.
Yee!
From here on in,
it's McCoy territory.
You mean, we'ns is home?
That's right, Cousin.
McCoy territory. I'd like to see
a Winfield put foot in here. I'd...
<i>Whoa!</i>
<i>Hi, you all.</i>
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!
Howdy, folks. Well, what do
you know, it's Cousin Dorothy.
Doggone, look at them
store-bought clothes.
What brings ya back, Cousin?
What are ya here for, Dorothy?
I came to see Granny.
Where is she?
Where do you think she'd be,
plowin' the field?
Not when there's a county fair
goin' on. Howdy, child.
Gee, it's good to see you.
I brought you back a surprise.
Wilbert? Wilbert. Come here. I
want you to meet your kinfolks.
Howdy. Hey, you a soldier? Yup.
What do you hear about the
war situation? Last I hear it,
Grant had Lee tied up
at Richmond.
How come I didn't read about that
in the newspapers? Oh, Wilbert!
Granny, I found him
in New York.
<i>You found that?</i>
He's not a husband, Granny.
He's a cousin of ours.
He's the grandson
of Squeeze Box McCoy.
Squeeze Box McCoy.
Hallelujah!
My prayers is answered.
He don't look like
what I prayed for.
<i>I guess if you ask the Lord for lean meat
and get fat, a person should be satisfied.</i>
Oh, he's a real McCoy,
all right. I saw the evidence.
I'm his friend, Al Stewart. Uh,
Wilbert, show your granny the picture.
That's Squeeze Box all right.
Tarnation.
Wait 'til the Winfields get the word. The
county fair'll shine like Fourth ofJuly.
County fair, and the
Fourth ofJuly, all together?
Boy,
and what fun!
<i>And what blood running all over
the fairgrounds. Clem, Luke.</i>
Shut up! If you're scared, go back home.
Hold on a minute, Granny. Thought
I was head of this here clan.
You were, but a Squeeze Box is back. Hmm.
Don't look like
no Squeeze Box to me.
Do he, Cousins?
Well, he don't to me.
<i>Must a been the last of
the litter. Why, neighbors,</i>
you see before you
a born leader.
And to prove to you
that he is what he claims he is,
here's his grandpappy's
concertina.
Gimme that!
That's his squeeze box
all right. That's him for sure.
Listen, you'ns, you hear me tell that if a
Squeeze Box McCoy ever come back to these hills,
the treasure'd be found.
Well, your Cousin Wilbert's
worth his weight in gold.
So make sure
nothin' happens to him.
Are you McCoys
to be took in...
by a couple of...
city slickers?
Supposin' Dorothy was blabbin' off her mouth
in some of them saloons she's been a-singin' in.
Mightin' ya find an old picture
and a squeeze box...
and come here to fool
an old woman.
Nobody calls me an old woman,
and nobody fools me.
Now I didn't mean to rile ya, Granny,
but I still say let 'em "betest" it.
That's "fahr". If he's a
real McCoy, let him prove it.
He can do that at the turkey-shoot
today. A real kin of Squeeze Box...
<i>will outshoot the best of
the McCoys or the Winfields.</i>
And if he can't shoot at all, the Winfields'll
laugh us right out of the fairgrounds.
Your shoot,
Cousin.
You just...
Hey, Al, how-how do you
work one of these here?
<i>You pull the trigger.</i>
That's him.
The little fat feller.
Been hearin' that
a Squeeze Box is back.
Thar he is. You mean he's
a kin of Squeeze Box McCoy?
I'm Wilbert.
Wilbert?
Ha! A critter with a name like that
ain't worth startin' a feud over.
But if you's aimin' to get
fractious... Look here, Devil Dan,
for 60 years we've been
soft-walkin' McCoys,
now our feet
don't hurt no more.
And if you'n make one move,
we'ns will tromp all over ya!
We'ns is gonna meet at that
turkey-shoot and decide things.
And don't you forget
to bring your shootin' iron,
Wi-i-i-ilbert!
I "knowed" no Winfield'd pay
respect to a name like "Wilbert. "
Then we'll christen him after his
grandpappy and call him Squeeze Box.
You're right, Granny.
Let's have us a christenin'.
Appears to me, he's a
little big for a christenin'.
Well, they christen
battleships and they're big.
Calem, you do the christenin'.
Take off your hats.
Bow your head, Wilbert. I now
christen thee Squeeze Box McCoy.
He sure is "purty,"
ain't he?
On the outskirts of our town
lived a gal named Sadie Brown
They say she's makin' money
by the peck
For the simple country maid
landed on the Hit Parade
In a manner
that we never did expect
Unlike any of her kin she
grew whiskers on her chin
And her sideburns caused
the neighbors to remark
<i>Through no effort ofher own
soon her beard became full-grown</i>
Now they've got her
on display in Central Park
They call her Sagebrush Sadie
The famous bearded lady
Her whiskers brought her
riches and renown
They're the pride of the museum
and it costs two-bits to see 'em
And the family's gettin' rich
on Sadie Brown
She started runnin' 'round
with a barber in the town
And the fellow seemed
to have an awful crush
But it's easy to explain
why she drove the man insane
For Sadie had the skin
you love to brush
Her barber friend proposed
just as everyone's supposed
But the way he did it
made her kind of vexed
He'd been married twice before
and the thing that made her sore
Was when he rode up to
her gate and hollered "Next"
She consented with a smile and
he led her down the aisle
In the chapel where
the mornin' glories bloom
But poor ol' Parson Trout
couldn't get it figured out
So he shook hands with the
bride and kissed the groom
They call her Sagebrush Sadie
The famous bearded lady
She's happy that she's wed
and settled down
For her little baby daughter
Has a moustache
like an otter
She's the image
of her mother, Sadie Brown
You broke your promise Oh,
yes, you broke your promise
And now I'm all alone and
blue I'm so alone without you
You said you loved me Oh,
yes, you said you loved me
And not a word you said
was true What did I do
- You promised
you'd be mine forever
<i>I didn't know you heard it And
we would never never, ever part</i>
<i>It must've been
my brother</i>
But you broke your promise
Oh, yes, you broke your promise
And that is how you broke
my heart
My darling, don't dispair
There's still another chorus
I wish I had a nickel every
time that she was fickle
There's no mirror on his shelf
He's so mean he hates himself
Promise you'll be mine
forever
And we will never
never, ever part
Nothin' left for me to say
Come on, Wilbert, start to play
You broke your promise Oh,
yes, you broke your promise
And now I'm all alone and blue
2-3-4-5-6-7-8
You said you loved me Oh,
yes, you said you loved me
<i>- And not a word you said
was true, 7-6-5-4-3-2</i>
You promised you'd be mine
forever and ever and ever
And we would never
ever part
<i>But you broke your promise
Oh, yes, you broke your promise</i>
And that is how
you broke my heart
<i>Yes, that is how you broke
That is how you</i>
<i>That is how you
That is how you</i>
<i>That is how you broke</i>
<i>My heart
My heart</i>
Thanks for the songs,
Miss McCoy.
I didn't expect to see the Manhattan
Hillbilly so far from Tin Pan Alley.
Tin Pan Alley? That's no hillbilly
talk. You must be a "fereigner. "
I was born here,
my folks moved north.
But where music is concerned,
I'm still a hillbilly.
I'm down here trying to find some real
mountain music that hasn't been commercialized.
The name is Winfield.
Clark Winfield.
A Winfield directing a
McCoy? Well, sure now, ma'am.
You don't cotton to that there
feudin' nonsense, do ya?
I don't if you don't, partner? Even
if I did, I'd make an exception to you.
Any exception to seeing the fair? Let's go.
Get your hot roasted peanuts, carmels,
crackerjacks, cigars... What'll you have?
Oh, lemonade,
please.
Make it two.
How 'bout a hot dog?
No, I don't want a hot dog.
These hot dogs are different. Everybody
sells 'em with a pickle in the middle.
Now, what happens? You eat 'em, you get
mustard all over you. Now, we're different.
We put the frankfurter in there, mustard
in the middle. Mustard in the middle.
There we are. Pickle on top. No fuss,
no muss, no napkins, there you are.
Well, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
First, you're stuffing your face with pie,
and now you're loading yourself with hot dogs.
Now you know why I don't like mustard.
It's your turn at the turkey-shoot.
And we've gotta beat those Winfields.
You know I don't know how to shoot a gun.
Didn't you learn how to shoot in
the army? I was in the cavalry.
What kind of bullets come out of
a pitchfork? All right, listen.
You stay here. I'll go
and fix it up for you.
How 'bout
another hot dog?
Howdy, Mr. Winfield. I ain't no Winfield.
Good. How would you
like to make a dollar?
Just name your man. All I want is for my
fat friend there to win the turkey-shoot.
All you have to do is get behind some big rock
or something. There's a big tree down there.
Good! As long as you
make it a bull's-eye.
Hey, how'd you like to make 50 cents? How?
When the little fat city feller goes up
there to shoot, just make sure he wins.
Jed, how'd you like to pick
up ten cents? Ten cents.
How do I get it?
Be sure that little fat city
feller wins the turkey-shoot.
Wanna make five cents?
Sure.
Here.
I've got it all set. I've got a guy to shoot
from behind the tree the same time you do.
Can you trust the guy? Can you trust
him. You don't know these mountain folks.
They're as honest as the day is
long. The days here are gettin' short.
Oh, please. Come on, come
on. Come on, come on, come on!
Just a squirrel twitch outside.
So far, the Winfields has got it.
We'ns is ahead.
All you'ns got left is Wilbert and he
apt to hit a hog in the next county.
Start shootin', Squeeze Box.
All right, fella,
when I say "Fire," fire.
Get ready.
Fire.
Fire.
Al, am I behind
the right tree?
Will you stop fooling
and aim at the target.
Squeeze Box.
I came to help ya.
Well, if'n you're
gonna shoot, shoot.
Take aim. When I say,
"Fire," pull the trigger.
Fire.
The McCoy's win!
<i>He is a real McCoy.!</i>
First turkey-shoot
we've won in 30 years!
And you done it
by cheatin'!
<i>You can't shoot nine shots
from a single-bullet rifle gun.</i>
Who says I can't?
I do!
Okay.
Just like you McCoys to be sneaky
and underhanded behind our backs!
Behind your backs? Every McCoy that
a Winfield shot was shot in the back.
- You shot our kin.
- Yeah, but we shot 'em when they was lookin'.
<i>That's what you say,
old woman.</i>
- Don't you "old woman" me.
- Winfields!
<i>Hey, where you all runnin' to?
Ain't ya gonna wait for the turkey?</i>
Me neither.
Yeee!
Granny, how 'bout tellin' where the
treasure is before something happens?
Nothin's gonna happen. My rheumatism
tells me the rains is gonna come...
and spoil this
whole durn feud.
Balls of fire!
They usin' heavy artillery!
Just like'n you said, Granny.
We tromped all over 'em.
We sure made 'em hightail it.
They sure scared of us now.
Us McCoys sure got 'em.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
How could my kinfolks ever
live in a joint like this?
Probably your forefathers
lived here. Beg your pardon.
I say, probably your forefathers
lived here before you.
My forefathers?
Well, sure.
I didn't have no forefathers.
Well, sure you did.
If I did, only one come
home nights. Go on, stupid!
<i>You...
Boy, listen to that rain.</i>
But it was nice of Uncle Clem to put
us up like this. Well, I'll sleep here.
Oh, no you don't. This is
my bed. You sleep over there.
And, uh, who is going to make me? Me.
Squeeze Box McCoy.
Hmm.
And if I can't,
my kin can.
Well, go ahead. Your head's getting so big,
there ain't room in the bed for both of us.
What a night.
Sure is a-pourin' out.
Well, squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.
Good night.
Hooo.
Rain sure is cold.
I could use a warm spot.
Shift over, Unc.
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.
Hey, Luke,
who's that on the end?
That's Wilbert.
One of Squeeze Box's kin.
My brother, Zeke.
Welcome, Cousin.
Roll, Luke.
Shift, Unc.
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.
Howdy, Cousin.
Ain't a fit night out
for man nor beast.
Howdy, Noah.
Feller on the end
is a kin o' Squeeze Box.
Well, pleased to meet ya.
Always got room for kith and kin.
Sashay over, Zeke.
Roll, Luke.
Shift, Unc.
Squeeze over,
Squeeze Box.
Funny-lookin' dogs
down here. Heh-heh.
Excuse me.
When we get inside,
let me do the talking.
Who needs you? I'm the
new head man around here.
It's too bad the new head
isn't better than the old one.
Now, look...
Go on!
It's about time you'ns got
here. What is this all about?
Calem's got more questions to ask.
<i>We answered all the questions.
How about the jackpot?</i>
Thar goes
the still again.
Luke, how many times
I got to tell ya...
not to put too much
sugar in the squeezin's?
Calem, get on with your talk
so Luke can get the still fixed.
All right, Granny.
How many chill'un you got,
Squeeze Box?
I don't have any children.
No chill'un, huh?
How long ya been married?
I'm, I'm not married.
Thar. No wives, no
chill'un. And him, over 16.
He don't deserve to be head
of this here clan.
There's a lot
in what Calem says.
Squeeze Box, maybe you better get hitched 'fore
I let on as to the whar'bout's the treasure.
There's no problem for that. Wilbert must
know of some girl he's taken a likin' to.
Oh, sure.
Knew it.
Dorothy.
She kissed me once.
<i>She did?
Mm-hmm.</i>
Squeeze Box, you and your friend go outside
while we'ns has a little recommendin'.
Recommendin'? What's that? It's an old hill
custom. They're going to pick you a bride.
Can't I pick my own? Don't
try to buck traditions.
Marriage is a gamble.
It's like shooting dice.
But I'm gettin' faded before I
even make a pass! Come on outside.
I-I'm...
Never mind.
Why haven't I the right to pick my
wife? 'Cause you're dumb enough...
to pick a girl too young for
ya. What's age got to do with it?
Everything. Say you're 40 and you're
in love with a girl ten years old.
This one's a pip. I'm goin' out with
a ten-year-old. Wait. Just a minute.
Got a good idea where I'm gonna
wind up. Zoom! Wait. All right!
You're 40. She's ten.
You couldn't marry her.
Not unless I came from these
hills. Leave the hills out of it!
You're 40, she's ten. You're
four times as old as that girl.
You wait five years. Now
the girl is 15, you're 45.
Now you're only three times as
old. So, you wait 15 years more.
Now the girl is 30 and you're 60.
You're only twice as old as that girl.
She's catchin' up. Sure!
Now here's the question:
How long do you have to wait before
you and the girl are the same age?
Oh. Take your time and think it over.
No, no, no... What's
ridiculous? That's ridiculous!
If I keep waitin' for that girl,
she'll wind up older than me.
She'll have to wait for me.
Why should she wait for you?
I was nice enough to wait for her! If
she wants to marry me, she'll wait for me.
Marry you? Do you know the girl? No.
Why marry a girl you don't know?
That's what I'm tryin' to tell ya.
Why haven't I a right
pick my wife?
Stay here while they
do the recommending.
I'm not gonna argue about Wilbert
anymore. I think he's sweet, but...
But you're fixed on someone else.
That tune-collectin' Winfield!
That's my business. I don't see
what this has to do with Wilbert.
You're not keeping your promise. You're
not keeping your head! A Winfield!
<i>We're wastin'our time.</i>
I gives ya the blushin' bride
to be: my own sister, Matt.
You're right, Calem.
She's now on to 14.
Ain't no sense in her being
an old maid. That's right.
Oh, Calem.
Dorothy, better tell
Cousin Squeeze Box. Yes'm.
And I'm off to tell
the marryin'judge.
Ooh!
You sure are a lucky man. I am?
Dorothy'll tell ya all about
it. Maybe she changed her mind.
Wilbert, I want to talk
to you... alone. Oh.
Dorothy, Calem told me
what a lucky fellow I am.
He told you? Good. He did.
The wedding's
tomorrow morning.
Would you like to take
a walk in the moonlight?
I can't.
I have a date tonight.
You have a date tonight and
the wedding is in the morning?
Why, yes. And I have a date
tomorrow night with the same fellow.
Where will I be tomorrow night?
You'll be on your honeymoon.
I'll be on my honeymoon...
while you're on a date?
Yes.
Is something wrong?
Are you worried
about the wedding?
No, but it doesn't sound as
nice as you read it in the books.
Wilbert, Luke just told
me. He knows about it too?
Al, will you give the bride
away? Calem's gonna do that.
He's been tryin'
to get rid of her for years.
Listen you, you stop insultin' the
future Mrs. Squeeze Box McCoy, or...
Oh, Squeeze Box, darlin'.
Fightin' for me already!
Fightin' for you?
After all,
you two are engaged.
Dorothy, you mean that you
and I is really me and him,
and that him is a her? That's
what I've been trying to tell you.
Ooh. All this time
I thought him was a him.
Uncle Clem's takin' me to town
for a real store-bought dress.
Dorothy, will you come along and help me
pick out a real city-kind of bridal veil?
Well, anything for the future
Mrs. Squeeze Box. Come on.
Ee-yoo-ooh!
Al, you gotta get me outta this. Wait a
minute. I can't interfere in these things.
I'm a "fereigner. "
Oh. Look, you.
You gotta do somethin' to get me outta
this. Like it or not, you're a groom.
Yeah, but look
what I'm stuck with.
Yeah, they wanted me to hitch
up with Matt a year back.
Why didn't you? Got kicked
in the head by a mule.
I'm a little "tetched" now,
but I ain't that crazy.
Um, where's the stable
with the mule?
Down yonder.
He ain't all there!
<i>Calem, you sure made Matt happy.</i>
When do you suppose we're
gonna learn Granny's secret?
At the celebration. Granny'll tell
Squeeze Box where the treasure's hid,
<i>and Matt'll make him tell us. You
gonna kill him for the celebration?</i>
<i>No, wait until after the
weddin'. Then slaughter 'im.</i>
<i>Hey, you can use my knife
to slit his throat.</i>
He's sure gonna make an elegant
weddin' dinner. You gonna grind 'im up?
<i>No, gonna roast 'im and
put an apple in his mouth.</i>
<i>Al.! Al.!</i>
Granny! Al!
What's the matter? My kin ain't
mountain folks. They're cannibals.
What are you talking about? Calem
said he was gonna cut my throat,
and cook me. They was talkin' about
the pig for the weddin' dinner tonight.
Oh. Eh? Squeeze Box, come
inside. I wanna talk to you.
Sit down by the fire.
Oh, thank you.
Mm!
Squeeze Box, you're not much to look
at, but you got your good points.
And it's a durn shame
Dorothy don't see 'em.
And I'm gonna be rich
soon too. I'm "fer" ya.
But she's got her mind set on a no
-'count, mealymouthed Winfield.
There's just one thing to do:
get a love potion. Love potion?
Is that better than gettin'
kicked in the head by a mule?
A love potion from old Aunt Hetty
the witch. One drop in Dorothy's cup,
and she'll fall madly in love with the first
man she meets after she drinks it. Yeah?
A love potion?
Dorothy?
Granny!
Granny!
See ya later.
Hey, hey. Wait a minute. I'm scared.
You dragged me out here. That big
talk about witches and love potions.
I'm gonna prove what a superstitious
idiot you are. Get over there!
No, don't! Wait, Al. If you should see a
pair of gray pants flyin' by, don't grab 'em.
Why not? Go ahead! I'll be in 'em.
Did you see it?
See what?
That was only a bat. You started this and
you're going to finish it. Knock on the door.
I wanna go home.
Knock on the door!
Well, nobody home. Let's
go. We'll wait inside.
In hope she don't give me the evil
eye. There's nothing to be afraid of.
Just a simple,
humble cabin.
<i>Cheerful fireplace.
Above it, a departed friend.</i>
<i>Huh? The home of a poor old woman who uses
hocus pocus to fool the mountain folks.</i>
<i>I hope she don't show up.</i>
<i>There's nothing to be afeard
of. I've been waitin'for you.</i>
What do you all want?
He wants a love potion.
A love potion, dearie?
Aunt Hetty's Elixir of Love
never fails. How much do you want?
How much is it?
Cross my palm with silver. The
more it is, the stronger it gets.
Five dollars buys a powerful
potion. Al, give her $5.
Wait a minute. I want to see if
it works. You doubt my powers?
Not me, him!
I'll show ya.
Beelzebub, a fire!
Watch this, yes!
What's she doin'?
She's molding.
This time of the year?
This ti...
She's making voodoo.
<i>She's making
vous do what?</i>
Voodoo!
I do?
Not you do, voodoo.
I do what?
She's making
voodoo magic.
She's making voodoo magic? Yeah.
Do you know voodoo? You do? Sure! Sure.
Tell me more about 'im. Oh, quiet!
Sardoo-lee lagumi,
a-gitchy gazoo!
Look what she's makin'. That's... Effigy.
I don't know what letter it starts with,
but that's beginning to look like me.
Shh, quiet!
Sardoo-lee legachi,
lagumi gazoo!
Presto!
<i>Ouch.!</i>
Now, give me
the money.
Not 'til we get the potion.
She can't stick us for $5.
Oo-ooh! She can too.
Pay her the money.
Not 'til we get
the potion.
Oh!
That's just in your mind. You
got a poor sense of direction.
Please, pay her
the money.
All right.
Now that we understand each
other, I'll get the potion.
Potion, potion, magic be. Make
her love the first she'll see.
There. There'll be a small
deposit of $5 on the jug.
I'm not gonna
pay it.
You'll pay it or you'll suffer.
I've got you in my power. Oh, no! No!
O-O-Ow!
And I got you. Mm!
That wasn't fair!
Mm!
Stop!
Mm!
I'll quit
if you will!
Give me that thing! Oh, no.
Not 'til you give me that one.
Uh-uh! Not 'til I get the deposit
on the jug. Al, give her the money.
I'll pay her when I feel like
it, and I... I feel like it!
Ow-ooh-ooh!
Aw, come on.
Wait a minute. She must be a
witch. What's the matter? Why?
Look at that broom. That's
what she makes her visits on.
That's the kind of broom
I see in fairy tales. Nah.
Hey! A windshield
and a wiper.
That's for rainy nights. Are you kiddin'?
Oh, boy! Get a load of
it. What do you mean?
I still don't believe it. There it is!
I wonder if it works.
It does!
This must be the starter.
Oh! I'm sorry.
Wait a minute. I wonder if I'm a
heel doing this? What's the matter?
I'd do the same thing. Sure.
You would? Now I know I'm a heel.
Ahh, go on!
Squeeze Box.
Granny, I got it.
You better move fast. Winfield's
making friends with everybody,
and he's doin' pretty
durn good with Dorothy.
Get busy with that love
potion. Thanks, Granny.
Dorothy, may I
talk to you alone?
Certainly, Wilbert. Excuse me, Clark. Sure.
What's on your mind, Wilbert?
Dorothy, you gotta do me a favor.
If you marry me, then I can get rid of Matt,
or else I'll have to resort to this jug.
Wilbert, drink never solved any
problem. Besides, my heart is elsewhere.
You mean you didn't bring
it with ya? Oh, Wilbert!
Let's throw the jug away. First,
will you drink a toast to my wedding?
Sure.
Good.
How about you? I don't need any potion.
Potion? I mean, I don't need
any potion of "thet" thar stuff.
You certainly picked up
the hillbilly talk.
Well, here's luck
to you.
Howdy, Cousin.
Works!
<i>I have the strangest feeling
I've never had before.</i>
Quite suddenly
you seem to be
The one that I adore
My heart is not
a plaything
So handle it with care
Without a doubt
if you walk out
Then you had best beware
You'll be just another notch
on Father's shotgun
If'n you don't marry me
So if you'd rather be dead
than blissfully wed
Don't get that ring
you promised me last spring
Now, Pa hardly ever misses
When he draws that gat
from his hip
And you have your choice
of kisses
Or a slug of lead
in the lip
So don't learn your lesson
from Dad's Smith & Wesson
And don't be a suitor
of Papa's six-shooter
Just get that preacher
on the run
Or you'll be just another
notch on Father's gun
You'll be just another notch
on Father's shotgun
If'n you don't marry me
So if you'd rather be found
'neath six feet of ground
<i>Just leave me ditched
instead of gettin'hitched</i>
Now, Pa says
if you wanna linger
When he takes that gun
from the wall
You'd better put that ring
on my finger
Or you won't breathe
no more at all
At all
<i>So don't be a jester
with Papa's Winchester</i>
<i>And don't be an eyeful
in Daddy's ol'rifle</i>
And stop hesitatin'
and don't keep me waitin'
Just get that preacher
on the run
Or you'll be
just another notch
You'll be just another notch
on Father's gun
Oh, you fascinating creature. I
can't let you go, you know that.
Let me run my fingers through
your hair. That's my hat.
Dorothy, have another drink.
A small one. Go ahead.
Mm!
Squeeze Box!
This is my kissin' cousin.
That weren't no cousinly kiss. Shh!
Sure weren't. Never mind,
Calem. The boy ain't hitched yet.
No, but it 'tain't fittin'.
I'll get the bride to be.
Calem sure is anxious
to get you married.
But so am I.
Say you will.
Pretty please?
Mm-hmm. Dorothy,
let's drink to our wedding.
Squeeze Box...
Howdy, Cousin. I'm sorry,
Matt, but I want him for myself.
I'm sorry, Dorothy. I want Matt
for myself. You fascinating beauty.
Why, Wilbert! Let me run my
fingers through your hair.
But Wilbert, how could you
have forgotten so soon?
Why, just a moment ago
I kissed you.
Anybody that would kiss me would
kiss anybody. Puh-lease, Dorothy.
Puh-lease.
Excuse me.
Come, my little loved one.
Come on.
If I hadn't seen that,
I wouldn't have believed it.
He drunk from the jug
and saw Matt first.
How long does it take to wear off?
Depends on how big a swig he took.
Oh, Squeeze Box, I can see
the lovelight in your eyes.
Matt, don't put it out.
Gimme that jug. I'll mark it
so nobody else will get it.
You got a pencil?
Wilbert, I wanna
talk to you.
<i>I can't hear you,</i>
for the wedding bells
are ringin' in my ear.
Let's drink to them
weddin' bells.
Eh...
Uh, no, no, uh...
The bride first. Come
on, Matt. Not that one.
Just a teensy-weensy bit.
But not this.
<i>Why not? That's
some of Granny's best corn.</i>
You shouldn't have drunk that. Why not?
Howdy, Cousin. What're
you lookin' at me for?
Why should I ever want to look at
anything else, you fascinatin' creature.
Eh, b-b-but look... Yes. Not
now. Al, kiss me. Just once.
Let me run my fingers through your
hair. Just a minute. She's mine.
She's not yours. I'm
your girl. No, you're not!
I've changed my mind.
Well, I've changed my mind.
I haven't changed mine.
And I haven't changed mine.
And I'm going out of my mind! She's mine!
<i>I'm your girl.
No, you're not.!</i>
You're mine! I am not. You're mine!
Get away!
Somebody's mine!
Some kind of party game? Think so, Calem?
Can't rightly say.
I think still think Cousin
Squeeze Box is a little "tetched".
"Tetched" or no "tetched",
there are gonna be a weddin'.
All right, judge,
start the marryin'.
Squeeze Box,
you'll never regret this.
We get the treasure, and you get
yourself a fine little mountain flower.
If there be anybody in this
assembly who has reason why...
this here ceremony
shouldn't take place...
Listen to me.
'Cause if'n you don't, this here
shootin' iron'll speak for me.
Dorothy, this is
ridiculous. You can't do it.
I can't? I'll bullet any man,
woman or mule that tries to stop me.
I came here to get me a man.
Live if possible.
Dead if necessary.
And that man
is Wilbert "Squeeze Box" McCoy.
I wanna, I wanna, I
wanna... You wanna what?
I wanna go home.
And I want Al.
Then get yourself
a gun and get 'im.
<i>Go on, judge.
Make him my ever-lovin'man.</i>
<i>If there's anybody else...</i>
Clark, what happened?
Where am I?
You're all right now,
but you almost married Wilbert.
Oh, no! Well, I never. Hmm!
I wanna marry Matt,
anyway. Hmm-mm!
That's my girl. Oh-ho-ho-ho!
Go ahead, judge, we're ready.
What's goin' on here?
If I get a chance to get all the
words out, you're going to be married.
Good. To Dorothy?
Uh, to Matt.
Mm-hmm!
I don't wanna marry her.
And I don't wanna marry him.
I don't wanna marry anybody!
By sassafras! I come 30 miles
to do this here knot tyin'!
I'll marry him anytime. You
mean, you want to marry Al?
He's so gorgeous. But he ain't no McCoy!
Calem, we'll make him a McCoy.
We'll do it the hard way.
We will christen him.
Have you got a jug? Yeah.
Let me have it.
Ha-ha!
Wilbert! Wilbert!
Wilbert!
You can't
do this to me!
Uh-huh. Calem, this may be your
last chance to get rid of Matt.
And besides, I'll throw in five
percent of the treasure for a dowry.
But, Wilbert,
I'm your pal.
Oh, Al, you're gonna marry
a sweet little mountain flower.
Oh, goody! All right,
brother-in-law, let's make it legal.
Now, judge,
go ahead.
Who's gettin' married?
You and him.
But I don't want him.
I want him.
Somebody find out
who wants who!
Calm yourself, judge. We'll be
glad to give you the right answers.
Won't we, sugar? We sure will, honey.
No Winfields!
That's right. If'n a feud starts, it'd be
mighty unhandy havin' a Winfield in the family.
Oh, it's time you stopped
this stupid feuding.
There's not a better man among you than Clark
Winfield. If he wants me, I'm proud to have him.
Go ahead, judge.
If there's anybody else, let him
speak now or forever hold their peace.
Winfields!
Hey, come on over! Clark and
Dorothy are gettin' hitched.
That's what I figured'd be goin' on. There ain't
no Winfield gonna tie up with no McCoy wench.
Dan, this is
my business.
You Winfields has got the best
of the bargain, so 'bide by it.
I'm seein' Dorothy's point. Feudin's
silly. From now on, I'm a peaceful woman.
Granny's right. From now on,
let's have a peaceful feud.
You hush up,
Wi-i-i-ilbert!
There'd have been no trouble in
these hills if'n you and that gal...
<i>hadn't come to see
the old woman.</i>
You said it again!
Winfield! Clark, get ahold of Dorothy!
Judge, you start the marryin'.
I'll start the car.
Go ahead, McCoys. You'ns a-started
this ruckus, so start a-shootin'.
Here. Us McCoys is in for
a fight. Good luck to ya.
Calem,
hold your fire!
Now they can't make up their
mind who's gonna do the shootin'.
Keep on talkin', judge. That's only
the backfire of the car echoin'.
<i>I'm here to...</i>
Wait!
Hey, I ain't
finished yet!
Hold it!
Now that we're gonna
be kinfolks by marriage,
what do you say we talk this whole
feud over peaceful and quiet like?
Well, let me hear
from ya!
What's going on out there? My
in-laws. They're acting like outlaws.
- I'm a-comin' for you,
Wi-i-i-ilbert! - How we gonna get away?
He can't come through the door.
I got it bolted.
And if he comes
through the window,
I'll clunk him on the head
with this thing.
Al, I think
I scared him away.
Oughta sayin' your prayers,
Wi-i-i-ilbert!
You ain't a-gonna get away from
me this time, Wi-i-i-ilbert!
He ain't Wi-i-i-ilbert! You better
both start sayin' your prayers!
<i>You'll get the chair for this, Devil
Dan.! Get the chair. The chair.!</i>
<i>I ain't a-gonna get no chair.
The countyjudge is a Winfield.!</i>
Winfield or no Winfield,
you're gonna get the chair.
Whee!
He got it.
Thanks, Matt.
You saved our lives.
That ain't all I saved.
Come on.
I saved the treasure too. What's
the concertina got to do with it?
I ain't tellin', 'less'n
you promises to marry me.
He promises.
I do not!
I'm your agent
and I'll do your booking.
Will you please tell us where the
treasure is before we get shot?
All right. I'll tell you the
secret, but he's gotta marry me.
Uh, he'll marry you
all right.
Now you broke
my concertina.
And it's a wastepaper basket. I
never knew it. Hey, it's a map.
<i>That's right.
The map of Lost Springs Mine.</i>
That "X" shows where the
treasure is buried. It's a cinch.
Only trouble is, Lost Springs
Mine is in Winfield territory.
It "shore" is. Only I didn't know
there's treasure buried in it.
You know, you're gettin' to talk more like
Devil Dan. Let me hear you say "Wilbert. "
Wi-i-i-ilbert.
Oh, no. That...
Nicest little feller I ever
"knowed". I love him like a brother.
<i>Never see'd a feller
I liked so much.</i>
If you're such a pal, how
about calling off the fireworks?
Why "shore. "
Huh?
Winfields!
Hold your "fahr. "
<i>It's me,
Devil Dan a-talkin'.</i>
Get in, boys.
But Dan'I!
What are you doin' there?
I'm a-takin' my friends
to the Lost Springs Mine.
Well, that's our territory. I
don't think I "heared" you right.
You "heared" him right. Start
drivin', Daniel. Yes, sir.
Granny, Calem,
Squeeze Box run out on me.
And he tricked us outta the treasure. How?
I give 'im the concertina
'cause I thought he'd marry me.
- How'd you know the secret?
- I peeked while you was workin' it. I wouldn't have told if...
Double-cross his own kin,
will he?
Calem, from now on
you're head of this clan.
You get that concertina back,
and I don't care how.
That's what I've been
a-waitin' to hear.
<i>From now on, that Squeeze Box
ain't no better than a Winfield.</i>
Durn it,
I forgot my corn mash.
Come on, McCoys!
It done it again!
Well, there ya are. Anything
else I can do for ya, Squeeze Box?
Tell him to go home. Uh, no,
that's all right now, brother.
You and the boys
can go home.
Well, if that's the way you
want it, good-bye, brother.
<i>Good-bye.</i>
What am I doin' here...
with you?
You were just sayin'
good-bye, brother.
Don't call me "brother",
Wi-i-i-ilbert!
<i>Winfields.!</i>
<i>Wilbert!</i>
Wilbert!
Where are you, Wilbert?
<i>I'm down here.</i>
<i>Watch out for that first step.
It's a big one.</i>
Come out there.
Come on up here.
What's the matter with you?
Give me your hand. Get my hand.
Come on, get up.
Nyahh!
You coward, you! What are you trying to do?
Hide and make me fight the Winfields all alone?
<i>The Winfields!</i>
Oh!
There they are,
at the bottom of the shaft!
They give us
the slip!
Why don't we go get 'em? We can't
go up 'til somebody comes down.
With the Winfields down there, we'll never
get the treasure. I'm gonna get the McCoys!
There's the traitor!
Whoa!
Help!
<i>It won't go down.</i>
Hey, we're in the middle again.
Let's hide.
They took the elevator.
We got 'em trapped. Get in.
Don't nobody shoot Squeeze Box
'cept me!
Just like those Winfields:
always raisin' the roof.
I gotta show Calem the map.
That'll prove that I'm no traitor.
Come on. Okay, come on.
Let's go.
Aahhh! We've gotta put some weight on here.
Huh? Help me carry these rocks.
They're up thar.
What are they doin'?
I know how we can catch 'em, Calem. How?
We stay right here, and then when
that other elevator comes down,
we reach over and grab 'em. Uh-huh.
Boy!
Excuse me, hold this rock. Yeah.
Hey, is that what you've been
carrying? Yeah, they're heavy.
What's the matter with you? Oooh!
Ah, there's no use. This won't go
down 'til they get off. Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
I'll fix that.
Hey, you McCoys. Get off the
elevator so we can come down.
Hey! It's the treasure! Gold! Gold!
Don't forget, I'm your
agent. I get ten percent.
<i>My grandpappy! He must've
put in a burglar alarm.</i>
What are you men
doing in here?
<i>What are you men doing
here? What are we doing here?</i>
This happens to be Fort Knox!
Fort Knox!
All right, son, take 'em away. Yes, sir.
Just a minute.
