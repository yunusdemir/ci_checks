Look, we docked
one hour ago,
go have brunch
and come back,
and some jerk steals
our dingy.
Well, sir,
I'll find your boat.
How could some clown
just waltz over here,
cut these ropes,
and putt away?
Does your boat
have a name, sir?
Look, she's the Affinity II,
Camden, Maine.
I'll find your boat.

I've never really
had much luck with men...
Not until I met George.
All right,
he's not exactly what
I had in mind for a husband.
I mean,
he's twice my age,
a real klutz sometimes,
and, of all things,
a superior court judge.
But I do love him.
He helped me
with my little addictions,
calmed my nerves,
and sentenced me
to only 2 years probation.
I brought him here
to my family's summer house
for a little sun and sand.
I'm sure in time
he'll get the hang of it.
This'll be our first
real vacation.
At last we are alone.
Well, except for Lance.
He's my childhood friend.
Lance and I grew up
swimming in the tide pools,
sticking crabs
in each other's bellybuttons,
And playing tag underwater.
He lives here now
and looks after the place for us.
<i>~ Sail on,</i>
<i>Sail on... ~</i>
George and Lance
get along, um, pretty well
for 2 guys who have
absolutely nothing in common,
and I'm counting on Lance
to show George the ropes,
so they've planned
an overnight fishing trip.
I'm not looking forward
to being left alone.
Hey. Morning, Mo.
It'll be our first night apart
since we were married.
I don't want you to go.
But it was your idea.
Mmm.
I changed my mind.
Ohh...
this is our time, George.
There's no phones,
no faxes,
no television.
Just us.
Ahoy, mates!
Hey, George.
You ready?
Oh, yes. I just have
to get my things.
For me?
Oh, well, uh...
actually, I guess it's...
it's... it's for the both of you,
For the newlyweds...
to brighten your day.
That's so sweet.
You haven't brought me
flowers for years.
God!
Are you sure you'll be all right?
I'll be fine.
I can always sniff your shirts.
Chin up.
We'll be back tomorrow
around noon,
then I'll give you
my full attention.
Mmm.
And remember,
no drinking
and no sedatives.
- We'll be out around Seal Island.
- Okay.
Have fun.
Behave yourselves.
Love you!
Bye!
Be good!
Bye!
Bye-bye!
Now what?
Ugh!
Aw, shit.
All right. Okay.
<i>~ Living in a time bomb ~</i>
<i>~ Livin' in a time bomb ~</i>
<i>~ Livin' in a time bomb ~</i>
<i>~ Livin' in a time bomb ~</i>
<i>~ I really hate to read</i>
<i>the paper sometimes ~</i>
<i>~ To see what's happening</i>
<i>on the nights I don't sleep ~</i>
<i>~ But according to sources</i>
<i>everything's fine ~</i>
<i>~ I guess they're not living ~</i>
<i>~ In the same place as me ~</i>
<i>~ I'm livin' in a time... ~</i>
George?
Lance?
- Guess again.
- Aah!
- It's me!
- Oh, God! Kent!
You shit!
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
I swam.
Oh, funny.
Would you believe
I borrowed a friend's boat?
Since when do you have
any friends?
Well, he's a brand new one.
We didn't get around
to exchanging names, but we're tight.
We're like this.
You'll never change,
Kent Draper.
I brought you something.
Calla... calla lilies
and, uh, dark chocolates,
right?
Fantastic.
I thought
you'd like them.
I got a little something
for the judge, too,
but I, uh...
ate it on the way.
I'm sure he'll be devastated.
I think the reason
it works between us
has a lot to do
with our age difference.
You see,
I'm very secure.
Mm-hmm.
And I think that's
especially good for Nathalie,
considering what she's had to go through
with the men she's been with.
Well, I wasn't sure
when she told me
she was gonna marry
a man who was a judge,
- But, uh...
- Pretty tough judge.
Well, that, too.
But, you know,
Nathalie seems happy,
and that...
and that makes me happy.
I mean, we've been
like brother and sister our whole lives.
And I appreciate
your relationship with her.
I suppose I could be jealous,
but I'm not.
Except when it comes
to squirting Kent Draper
with lighter fluid.
Well, that was different,
wasn't it?
He had a hold on her
that had to be broken,
so I broke it.
Yeah, I guess you did,
but, uh, lighter fluid?
That's not very judge-like, is it?
Oh, hell.
I didn't even light it.
So why the hell
didn't you pick me up?
What are you talking about?
- Didn't you get my postcard?
- What postcard?
The postcard I sent you
a week ago
to tell you
that I was coming.
Had a picture of the big bad wolf
on the front.
You sure you didn't get it?
No, I swear I didn't get
any postcard.
You know, you really
shouldn't be here.
Thank God George
is out fishing.
George is fishing?
Really?
God, I didn't think
he was the type.
- Well, maybe you underestimate him.
- Well, I don't know.
After all, he married my girl.
I'm not your girl anymore.
Do me a favor.
Just twist that knife
right there in the back.
- Right between. Give it a nice...
- Stop it.
I'm slipping.
Oh, man.
Ah-choo!
You're a mess.
Why, thank you.
I'll get you something
to put on.
Vodka... vodka...
Kafka.
Agh, you cheap bastard.
Thought you were supposed
to quit that.
Yeah, but...
Evelyn...
Evelyn finally left me.
Oh, no.
She took the kid, too.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what it is,
you know?
I'm just not cut out for it.
It's hard right now.
But, well, listen,
you know,
I'll bounce back, right?
Always do.
You still shouldn't be drinking.
Please. Doctors...
Come on,
what do they know?
I think vodka's
the last of my vices.
Considering how many
I started with,
that's not bad.
Please join me.
No, George doesn't
like me to.
My God, he's got his eye
on you, doesn't he?
Kent.
Maybe that was my mistake.
Maybe... maybe I thought a girl like you
has got a mind of her own.
I mean, personally,
I kind of liked it that way.
Enough.
All right, so when's
the old man due back for dinner?
I'm starving here.
Who invited you?
- Ooh, you think he'll mind?
- Yes, I do.
Lucky for you, he won't
be home till tomorrow.
Really?
Very sorry to hear about that.
May I?
Sure.
I'd say this is almost tame
compared to what
you usually do.
Hmm.
Well, I usually get
a pretty strong response.
Looking at your picture,
I couldn't help thinking of Nathalie.
Oh. Well, I wasn't
thinking... you know.
No, no.
- It actually made me feel good.
- Oh.
I guess you'd like to know
Nathalie hasn't taken
any medication for over a month.
Well, that's, uh,
that's great.
I mean,
I know she needed it,
But she needed
to get off it, too.
Well, I think
what we're seeing now
is the light at the end
of the tunnel.
I sure hope so.
Hey, you want a drink?
I haven't had a drink
since I got married.
Oh, well,
that's great.
So who's the architect,
Frank Lloyd Wrong?
That's George's dream project.
Lance keeps trying
to help him,
but George is just
too stubborn.
He wants to do it all
on his own.
Mmm.
Good luck.

<i>- ~...you done me wrong ~</i>
<i>- ~ Well... ~</i>
<i>- Yeah, I remember.</i>
<i>~ You took my love ~</i>
<i>~ And now you're gone... ~</i>
When's the last time
you danced?
<i>~ Please... ~</i>
With you, probably.
<i>~ Please... ~</i>
With me definitely.
Come here.
<i>~ Please,</i>
<i>Please ~</i>
<i>~ Honey, please... ~</i>
I don't think this
is such a good idea.
Of course
it's a good idea.
Dancing lightens the soul,
didn't you know?
Just 'cause your married,
doesn't mean that you're dead.
Oh, my God,
I missed you so much.
You have no idea.
Kent!
I think you should go.
<i>~ I... I... ~</i>
- Really?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Yeah.
Come on, I could've sworn
you were thinking
the same thing I was thinking
all night long.
Oh, I have to...
What are you doing?
Nothing. I'm dancing.
I'm just dancing.
<i>~ Must've been ants</i>
<i>in my pants ~</i>
- Oh!
- Aah!
Stop it!
I can't do this.
<i>~ Please ~</i>
<i>~ Ohh. ~</i>
Shit.
Kent! Kent?
They're back.
Get up.
Kent!
Shit.
Come on, get up.
They're back!
They're coming right now.
Kent!
Kent! Fuck.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Yoo-hoo!
Nathalie!
2 brave fishermen
home from the sea,
hungry for coffee
and my little Nathalie!
Don't let anyone say
your husband's
not a good provider.
Did everything go all right?
Mm-hmm.
Well, I didn't sleep
very well.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
You go back to bed and Lance
and I will make you breakfast.
- How does that sound?
- I'm a little too groggy to eat,
so I'm just gonna jump in the water
and try to swim it off.
- Okay.
- Okay?
You sure
you're all right, honey?
Guess I just missed you.
Aw.
Uhh.
Uhh.
<i>~ La da dee dee ~</i>
<i>~ Dee dee da da ~</i>
A little early,
isn't it judge?
I can't figure out
how it got here.
I know Nathalie doesn't
drink that stuff.
- What do you need?
- Sausage.
It's gone.
What's left is in the fridge.
Ok.
So where is it?
In the cigar box,
middle shelf, far right.
I only eat the best sausage,
So I keep it in the best box.
Are you sure
you're all right?
Yes.
You haven't been drinking?
It spilled.
You took the cap off first?
I need to talk to you.
All right.
Ahh.
What's going on here?
There we go.
I have to get some air.
I'll talk to her.
Hey...
did I miss something?
No.
No, I mean, I just
had a rough night.
Is that a crime?
No.
You know...
if you ever need
to get away,
You can, uh...
What do you mean?
Nothing.
It's just that my door's always
open for you, you know?
Hey, why don't you
come back tonight,
and we'll barbecue up
that fish,
Talk like old times?
Well...
not quite.
Don't worry about me.
I'm ok.
Ok.
Oh, that.
You got a new watch,
too, huh?
There's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.
Well, it's not my birthday,
huh, huh.
It's Kent's.
Kent's?
Nothing happened.
Well, if nothing happened,
why didn't you tell me
he was coming?
I didn't know
he was coming.
He sent a postcard
but we never got it.
Well, then why did he leave
before Lance and I got back?
He didn't leave.
He didn't?
He's still here.
Kent!
<i>~ Come out, come out,</i>
<i>wherever you are! ~</i>
Come on, lover boy!
Game's over!
Well?
Peek-a-boo, Kent.
Aren't you having breakfast...
or have you already had
the house special?
He's dead, Nathalie.
I know. I think
that it was his heart.
His heart?
You know,
he had a bad heart.
And it just stopped?
After 30 years,
it just gave out
for no good reason?
Evelyn left him,
and he was drinking all night.
He's naked!
He showed up here drunk,
he went for a swim,
He came back, he drank some more,
and then he fell asleep.
And that's
how I found him.
I swear nothing happened!
I'm sorry, George.
I just found him like that.
He was dead, and I thought
you would be jealous.
- I was afraid you'd go off...
- No, no, no, no.
- I'm sorry.
- I thought you'd go crazy.
Oh.
You know, I panicked.
I thought that you would be jealous.
We'll put him
in the storage shed for now...
then we'll take him
to Rockland.
Uhh.
Uhh.
His neck is broken.
Did he fall?
When you stepped on...
the cellar door.
"Judge delivers
young wife's ex-lover to authorities."
"It was his heart,"
he says,
dismissing broken neck.
Well, won't there be a...
an autopsy?
Sure...
when they get to it.
In the meantime,
they'll content themselves
with the headlines.
Oh, well. Get his clothes.
Let's be done with it.
Now what?
- They're at the bottom of the bay.
- What?!
I... I told you,
I panicked!
How the hell am I supposed
to deliver him without clothes?
"Nude ex-lover
with broken neck
delivered by jealous judge"!
Are you sure...
it was here?
I think so.
Uhh!
Uhh!
Uhh.
Uhhh.
Here, let...
let me help you.
- Hooh!
- Here.
Whew.
I remember looking at the cottage
from about here.
You have to fix 2 points...
to establish a position.
I'm gonna take another look.
No.
"I remember
looking at the cottage
from about here."
Uhh.
Nope.
Nothing.
Wonderful.
Maybe we can dress him
in your clothes.
Even your underwear
should fit him.
Well, you should know
all about that.
Can we stay here
until the autopsy's over?
You could,
but they'd want someone in jail,
and that would be me.
But nobody killed him.
Uh, I don't see how clothing
can make a difference
one way or another.
We're not talking
about a kindergarten squabble.
Anything can happen
in a court of law.
You sure you're not worried
about your position?
- I don't see how you can be...
- Don't you realize
that I could be convicted
on circumstantial evidence?
Don't you realize
that I could be convicted
Even if I'm innocent?
And I could spend
the rest of my life in jail
because of this stupid mess.
This is all my fault, George.
What we've got to do now
is stick together.
Now, go to the shed
and get the methanol for me,
and I'll clean the filter,
and we'll take him in.
It's not there.
It's in the vodka bottle.
Blue label.
So he drank
all the methanol, too!
How stupid,
putting methanol in a vodka bottle.
Did you watch him
drink the methanol?
He never went to the shed.
How do you know?
I was with him.
You watched him
every moment?
Even when he fell asleep?
I guess he could've gone
and found it in the shed.
Then where's the bottle?
I don't know.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking we really need
to get rid of this body.
You're not serious.
Oh, yes, I am.
But we didn't kill him.
He just died.
He just died?
Who do you think is
going to believe that?
First we poisoned him,
then we broke his neck.
Then we took his clothes...
and we're very sorry.
No one will believe us.
Do you understand?
At this point,
a simple drowning
is the most
plausible explanation.
But what about his family?
I know what I'm doing.
I'm going to get him ready.
Are we, uh...
taking him to Rockland?
I told you what we're doing.
But won't he... float? Uhh.
Nathalie!
Just carry him.
Shit.
On 3.
One...
two...
three!
Ow!
Unh!
- Gotcha!
- Oh!
Oh, sorry.
I just, uh...
thought I'd come over a little early
And help you chop up
some potatoes or something.
What you doing?
Oh... we're...
we're just getting rid of a little junk.
- Oh.
- Yeah, we're almost finished,
So why don't you, uh,
go back and start the potatoes?
Well, you don't think you're gonna
get rid of me that easily, do you?
Come on, let me
give you a hand.
There you go.
Ready, George?
Mmhh.
Uhh.
Uhh!
Huhh!
Easy.
Watch your step.
Uhh!
Ok...
You all right there, George?
Whoo!
Uhh! Uhh.
Thanks...
for the help, Lance.
Oh no, I'm not gonna leave you
holding the stove, George.
Besides, the reef
broke up last year.
Deep water's not
where it used to be.
It's not?
This should about do her.
I don't think
it's deep enough.
No?
Oh, yeah. You could
lose a courthouse down there.
- Why don't you get a closer look?
- Hey!
Ho ho ho!
You are gonna pay for this crime.
You gotta catch me first.
Come here, you!
Ha ha ha.
Ha ha! Aah!
Ow.
Aah!
- Aah!
- Ow.
- Hey!
- Oh!
Ho! Ha ha ha!
Lance, hang on a minute!
Uhh! Uhh!
You all right?
My back.
- Hey!
- Whoo!
Aah! Aah!
Ha ha! Lance, wait!
Lance! Wait!
Where are you going?
Huh.
Unh!
Hi.
Couldn't make it,
huh?
What?
Your back.
Ohhh!
Ahh.
Ok...
Uhh!
Well...
your problems are over.
The only thing we've gotten rid of
is the goddamn stove.
Oh, I suppose that's my fault.
Did the body appear because of me
or because of you?
It wasn't my fault
that he drank the methanol.
Was it mine?!
I don't keep methanol
in vodka bottles...
or sausages in cigar boxes
or melon balls in beer steins!
No! You just keep
naked corpses in the cellar!
What I'm asking you
is, did something happen?
I already answered
that question, George.
Did something happen?
No! No, no, no!
Why didn't you
want me to see him naked?!
That's enough!
You know, I really wish
That you would stop thinking
of yourself in this thing, George.
- We could be in a lot of trouble!
- Well,
you're finally getting the idea.
That's great, Nathalie.
I can't go through
with any more of this.
We have to take him
to Rockland.
Fine. I'd be happy to go along
with that, except for one thing.
He's got to be
wearing his clothes!
Aaaahhhh!
You wrecked my marriage!
You wrecked my career!
You wrecked my life!
Mmm...
mmm...
Hey, Nat,
is something wrong?
What?
You... look like you saw a ghost
or something.
No, I just... I never imagined you
wearing something like this.
Oh, that.
The tide brought it in,
and I just... figured
I'd dress up for dinner.
You know what? George and I
can't do that tonight
'cause his back
is just killing him.
Can't be too bad.
I... guess not.
Want to come in and say hi to Mo?
He knows you're here.
Got a great partner there.
Yeah, I sure do.
Still laughs
at all my jokes, too.
Don't you, Mo?
So what was that
all about today?
What all about?
Us...
under the water.
That was just old times.
Old times?
I don't remember that part.
So what do you think?
It's great.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You know what
I'd like to do?
What?
I'd like to take that suit
and clean it for you.
Well, it doesn't sound
like much fun.
Well, that's what
I'd like to do.
Ok. I got a better idea.
Why don't you just take the suit
and give it to George?
It's linen... I think.
And, uh...
I'm not really the linen type.
Hmm.
Where do you think
this thing came from?
I don't know.
It probably just drifted off
from someplace.
That suit...
I wonder if someone
might've drowned.
Who'd row all the way out here
in a dinghy in a white linen suit?
You got me there.
All right, so what are we gonna do
with the boat?
Well, George and I
are going into town.
We can take it
back with us.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, my boat's not
quite ready yet.
- Maybe I could, uh...
- Lance.
Someone will be
looking for it.
Ok.
George!
Hey, George!
I got the suit.
It just... it...
it floated in,
and the dinghy washed back.
So everything's solved.
We can go back into town
after all.
We got a perfectly reasonable
explanation.
Good girl.
You laid the steps.
I did it while
you were playing
ring-around-the-rosie
with cabin boy.
It's much cleaner this way.
Kent simply drowned.
He probably had
too much to drink.
But we'll never know
because the victim's body
will never be recovered.
No corpus delicti.
Do you realize
what you've done?
Huh. Yes.
You've cut up a friend
and cemented him
into the steps.
Quick, neat and final.
Did you ever think that I might
have some feelings?
Oh, I know
you have feelings.
Well?
Well, I put our future
ahead of your feelings.
Our future.
One of us
had to do something.
You couldn't, I did.
You made a mess,
and I cleaned it up.
But we didn't do
anything wrong.
You don't know anything
about criminal law!
The way things are,
we wouldn't stand a chance!
The only thing you know
about criminal law
is the silly little appearances
you and your friends made
in connection with drugs
and domestic disturbances.
You knew about having
your hand slapped, and that's all!
You've never been responsible
for any of your actions.
I suppose you have.
That's right!
Did you check the mail
this week?
As a matter of fact, I did.
There was none.
No postcard?
No postcard.
Where you going now?
For a swim.
What's wrong with you?
- Come here!
- No!
No!
You killed him!
You probably knew he was coming
all the time!
- What?!
- You saw the postcard!
You put the methanol
in the bottle!
You knew
he would drink it!
You're crazy!
No! You were jealous!
You could never forgive him!
That's why
you planned it!
You cut him up
to hide the traces!
That bottle!
He found that bottle in the shed,
and you know it!
You're a liar!
I'm telling you the truth!
- No!
- I'm telling you the truth!
Is this what
you're looking for?
This is powerful stuff.
Been taking many?
I took one today.
I take them all the time.
I'm sorry I tried to run away.
We have to get rid of these.
You gotta talk to me, George.
Tell me what you're thinking.
I'm thinking...
a single strand of hair...
a mere drop of blood...
any shred of evidence
could send us to prison for life.
And I don't want that.
Eat another chocolate.
I'm full.
No.
I need some sleep.
Me, too.
You're not serious?
I can't afford
your running away
and talking
to the authorities.
But, George...
We can't take
any chances.
When you've had time to think about it,
you'll understand
that this was all for the best.
Ok, I know you're a little upset.
Ok, really upset.
But... but you're not
thinking straight, George.
You get so crazy when you drink.
You... you can't keep this up.
Nightie-night.
<i>~ I've been lookin'</i>
<i>for my baby ~</i>
<i>~ And I wonder</i>
<i>where can she be ~</i>
<i>~ I saw my baby</i>
<i>early one mornin'~</i>
<i>~ She was walkin'</i>
<i>on down the street ~</i>
Nathalie! Stop!
Get away!
Shit!
Nathalie!
Leave me alone!
Stop, Nathalie! Stop!
- Uhh!
- Oh!
Huh!
Hey, you're up early.
Well...
I never really went to sleep.
No?
To tell you the truth...
we went
for a moonlight cruise, and...
one thing led to another.
How's your back?
Feels good!
You know, I've been thinking
about this suit.
And the dinghy.
Think there could have
been an accident?
I don't know.
I don't think so.
I mean, who'd go rowing
in a white linen suit? Humph.
I know. I think it just
slipped its moorings,
and the suit was
lying in the boat.
But Nathalie is
all worked up about it.
I thought you might
run it past the police.
I thought you two
were going to town.
Nathalie's not doing too well.
- She had a little too much to drink.
- Huh.
We're going to take a little excursion
as soon as she's better.
I'd sure appreciate it
if you'd drop this off.
I could get Nathalie
to stop bugging me if you would.
- What the hell?
- Humph.
I owe you one.
Nah.
Hmm!
Let's go boating.
Grrr...
- Wuagh!
- Mmm!
Hmm.
That was a quick trip.
I need more fuel
to make town.
Ah.
Are you ready to leave?
Just about.
Well, then I'll
just say good-bye.
You can't.
I haven't been totally
honest with you.
I didn't think so.
That's why I came back.
Yeah, I figured as much.
Her withdrawal
from the sedatives...
has been very hard.
And it all came
to a head last night.
She tried to kill herself.
Really?
Um... I found her...
with your shotgun.
Oh, God!
We're going to Rockland
as soon as she wakes up.
Well, uh,
I want to come with you.
You can't.
We've got to work this out
ourselves. Please.
Give her my love.
I will.
Lance!
Lance!
- Huhh.
- Ow.
Nat?
Oh, God, Lance,
I'm sorry.
He's going to kill me.
Who?
- George!
- George?
He killed Kent.
Kent.
I'm next.
It's true.
He told me that you
tried to kill yourself with my shotgun.
No, I was trying
to hold him off.
I was trying to escape.
I was trying to save my life.
You got to believe me!
Just relax, ok?
You don't need that.
Give me that.
It's ok.
It's all right.
Let's sit down.
Come on.
Just tell me what happened, ok?
Kent sent this postcard.
It was a picture of the big bad wolf.
It... we were supposed
to pick him up.
He... he said he was coming,
but I didn't see it, ok?
George hid it,
and he put the methanol in a bottle
and he left it in the kitchen.
He knew that Kent
was going to drink it,
and now he's dead.
And?
He cut him up and cemented him
in the steps of the gazebo.
You don't believe me?
Well, uh...
go and see for yourself.
He's there in the steps.
Now George wants
to kill me, too, Lance.
I'm not kidding.
I'm not joking around, ok? Go see.
All right. No, I will.
No, promise me.
I promise.
Ok. Now,
just stay here.
And don't worry, ok?
I'm going to get this whole thing
straightened out.
No!
Aah, don't touch me!
It's going to be ok, Nat.
- It's all right, Nathalie.
- Get away from me!
- You're safe with us.
- Help me, Lance!
See what I mean?
Don't listen to him.
We're going
to have to restrain her.
No!
- Nat!
- Ooh.
It's loaded.
My God!
He's going to kill me
and call it suicide.
Come on, Nathalie.
Aah!
Lance, give me a hand!
How?
Get a rope!
You... you don't need
to do that, do you?
No.
Of course not.
My nerves are just shot.
Lance, you promised me.
All right.
Let's go take a look
at the steps.
Steps?
Yeah.
Nat said that you
cemented a body in there.
Kent's.
You've got to be kidding.
No. Nat, um,
Nat thinks he was here.
Kent?
Look, I'll take care
of the damage, ok?
Let's just do it and then
we'll all be satisfied.
Fine by me.
Ok.
See you later, darling.
Lance, look...
this is crazy.
Why don't we just
let some time pass
and then go back
and say we did it?
I've never seen her
this bad before.
I know.
It's my fault, really.
I took away her medication.
I was afraid for her.
She was taking so much.
You added an extra step.
Um, I had to,
to even things out.
And I had extra cement.
It doesn't look
too bad, does it?
No, no. Hmm.
You know, George,
I was thinking...
with Nathalie in such a state,
you know,
I don't think it's a good idea
to upset her
any more than
she already is.
And if she sees we haven't
done anything, humph, well...
Hmm. It took me all day
to pour them.
Well, I promised her.
Mmm!
They're rock solid.
Oh, well.
Huh!
Oh, no!
George, no!
Please!
I know you didn't do it!
Oh!
Stop it!
Aah!
George?
George?
He's... he's dead.
How does that feel?
Much better.
I should do something
about George.
Don't go right now.
Please.
You need rest.
Lance, don't.
You know,
when we dumped the stove...
when we were in the water...
I could have done some things,
but George was around.
You understand?
Sometimes it's so easy
to get it all mixed up.
People who love
from a distance
or who love a
long time without...
getting any love returned.
Sometimes that love
can turn hard and brittle.
Sometimes the biggest love
can turn to hate.
It's a postcard.
Ha ha.
I forgot to give it
to you.
Why are you looking
at me like that?
I didn't read it.
Nat, I didn't know
Kent was coming.
I don't read
other people's mail.
Nat...
You think I killed him,
don't you?
Why, because I was...
I was stuck on you?
Oh, Nat,
don't think that way.
Nathalie!
Oh!
Nathalie!
No!
Nathalie, don't be crazy.
You're not making sense,
don't you see?
I couldn't have done
any of this.
When I found Kent's body,
George tried to kill me.
I love you too much to... oh!
- What have you done?
- Huh hey! Huh hey!
Walk!
What are you doing?
Not to worry, darling.
You'll sit tight this time.
Ah-choo!
Oh.
Now I've caught a cold.
Ahh.
What are you laughing at?
Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
Who's laughing now, tweety?
Too tight?
You're a monster!
Well, the monster
has good news.
Our case has been solved.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Lance...
killed Kent in a jealous rage.
He cut him up and cemented him
in the steps.
Goochy goochy goo.
All this was done
while we were out boating.
Upon our return,
I, being a middle-aged man...
had to lie down for a nap.
But Lance
wasn't finished.
He did this
awful thing to you.
Poor Lance.
Utterly demented.
Fortunately,
I was able to shoot him.
Isn't it perfect?
Well, I think it is.
And I feel like celebrating.
Eww!
What are you drinking?
I can't see.
It's the methanol.
Lance must have borrowed it.
I can't see.
I can't see.
Kent... Kent did die
of a heart attack.
I can't see.
Jesus, untie me, George!
- Aah!
- Untie me!
George!
Aah!
George!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah, there you are.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Help!
Help!
I'm stuck.
Come on, let me
give you a hand.
- You... you can't.
- Up.
Oh!
What's going on out here?
It's a long story.
I guess it must be.
I never even saw
the postcard.
Anyway, Kent started drinking.
He's not supposed to drink.
He... he has a heart condition,
palpitations or something.
I'm not sure, but once
he gets started,
there's just
no stopping him.
It's just
the way Kent is... was.
Is this making
any sense at all?
Uh-huh. Yeah.
Go on, go on.
So I never really
had much luck with men.
I thought that George
might change all that,
but then this happened.
Anyway, we didn't know
what to do.
You know, George
being a judge and all.
There would have been
a huge scandal.
- Are you getting all this?
- Yeah, sure.
- Can I keep going?
- Go right ahead.
Say, is there anything to drink
on board?
Oh, check the cooler.
So we thought that Kent
had drunk the methanol,
but it turns out
that he didn't...
