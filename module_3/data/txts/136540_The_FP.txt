You don't know shit about BTRO.

BTRO told me that if anything

I'm not goir back to that shit.
Get the fuck out of my way.
Yo, you know what BTRO told me
that night, huh?
Before he rolled up
into that match?
He told me he had never been
more proud of anyone

Ever since you was kids,

Paragraph.
All right, so check it.
My boy BLT owns this joint.
Him and BTRO used to roll
together back in the old days.
Yo, BLT! Where you at?
Yo, BLT. I finally reeled
JTRO's ass up in this piece.
Yo, he's the real deal.
For reals.
Set him up
in the tent out front.
A tent?
Yo, yo, yo. You're lucky you
even get a tent, nig.
I don't even get a room.
I gots to sleep on the couch.
Why?
'Cause you gotta earn
street cred and shit.
Don't you know?
Shit's tough in the FP, bitch.
Yeah.
Besides shit's better than dirt.
Fuck this, man!
No, no, no.
Yo, yo. Check it. Yo.
BLT's cool, man.
He's just been going through
a lot of tough shit lately.
We all have.
We need you, dog.
Why? What the fuck
is going on here, man?
Who the fuck is this dude?
Come on, JTRO.
I think there's some shit
you should check a look at.
What is all this?
It's just a basement, nig.
What's the BFD?
Yo, check it.
Shit's all fucked up
in the FP, JTRO.
After BTRO got 187'd,
the 248 lost its shit.
The 245 has taken over.
L Dubba E's got even more
street cred now
'cause his pops took a dirt nap,
left him
Dawrs Liquor Mart, son.
So now, no one drinks
unless L Dubba E says so.
It's the end of days
out there, JTRO.
The darkness has come.
God damn drunks goir straight
edge right on the street.
Resortir to meth and shit!
And now with no drunks
there ain't no bums.
And with no bums
there ain't no motherfuckers
to feed the ducks at the park.
What's a fuckir town
with no ducks, JTRO?
It's nothir! It ain't nothir!
How's a nigga supposed to sort
his shit out without no ducks?
We the last of the 248.
We bringir booze back to the
people from the underground.
And we need your help.
We can't take out L Dubba E and
his bullshit ass shit alone.
We gots to "Beat-Beat"
this shit right again.
BTRO was
on the front lines, JTRO.
Why didn't he ever tell me
about any of this shit?
'Cause he wanted to keep
yo ass safe,
tell you when the time
was right.
BTRO was my best nig, yo.
We had each other's backs,
back to back.
You ain't the
only one who lost BTRO.
We all did.
We all gotta deal with it.
We all is dealir with it.
Man: Get out of here,
you waste of skin!
Stacy: Shut up, Dad!
You're ruining my life!
Stacy's Dad: If that
motherfucker can keep his dick
out your box for a few minutes,
get some beer on your way home!
I ain't never coming home!
Fuck, fuck.

You were more than that.

don't mean it forgot about you.
Yo, bitch, who the fuck

Can yo' ass keep a secret?
You sure you're ready
for this shit?
Yeah.
What it is.
What is this place?
What is it now?
Or what did it used to be?
I don't know.
Well, during the Civil War
it used to be
an underground railroad.
Then during prohibition,
motherfuckers used
to run their moonshine
all through this bitch.
And now it's 248 HQ,
straight the fuck up!
Hold up.
BTRO... he wasrt the first
one that we lost.
But he will be the last.
Come on.
Booze should be a choice,
not a privilege.
For the ducks, B.
BTRO's death wasrt
your fault, nig.
It was his.
He wasrt expectir
the unexpected.
But it sure as fuck
expected him.
Ya heard?
And now your ass is here
so you won't make the same
mistakes as him.
In order to master "Beat-Beat"
you gots to master
the four rules of the B.E.A.T.
B... balance.
Not floppy twat legs.
You got to make two legs
count as one.
Balance, bitch. Balance!
- E... expeditiousness.
- What?
Speed, bitch!
My legs aren't fast enough.
Yeah, they are, bitch!
It's your mind that
ain't fast enough.
You got to dance with your mind,
not your legs.
I need speed, 'TRO.
I need speed, 'TRO.
Where that nigga at?
Move your shit!
What you got?
A roll of quarters up your ass?
Motherfucker,

If a nig don't got
the fire inside,
he needs to keep pushir.
Once his body's all 187'd,
he's kerplunked.
Suck my corndog, chump!
T... tempo.
Gots to keep your shit straight,

We almost lost you, JTRO.
'Cause of that,
we're all going to need gats.
Are we really gonna need gats?
Those 245 bitches is illir.
It's Beat War out there.
Beliee' dat!
Shit goes south,

This way we can back
the 248 the fuck up. All right?
It's like toothpaste, B.
Just in case.
A'ight, lets go back to the
clubhouse, talk some dills.
JTRO?
I know how it is, bro.
That bitch can never keep

What a fucking joke!
So where are your friends

with some of the older boys.
So you building a sand castle
or what you got going on there?

Sometimes you get lucky in here.
Um...

You need somebody

That's going to be a rad story
to tell the grandkids.
It's the best I got, JTRO.
You deserve
better than that, Stacy.
I deserve to be a grandma?
No.
Then what?
Without L Dubba E
my dad can't get booze.
And when he don't gots booze,
he turns to drugs.
I can't see him
like that no more.
I already got enough scars,
OK, JTRO?
Stacy, you don't need
L Dubba E to get booze.
I can help you.
Stacy's Dad: Stacy,
