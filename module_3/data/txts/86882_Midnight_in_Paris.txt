Look, this is incredible
There is a same city
around the world...
her has never been...
It seems as if never
you would have been...
I have not been enough,
that is the problem.
You can imagine how cool that is
This city in the rain...
Imagine this city
in the 1920s, Paris in the 20.
in the rain, with these painters
and writers...
Why all cities should be?
can be in the rain?
What wonderful in wet?
And you imagine us moving us here?
After the wedding?
Oh no... by God. It could not
live outside the United States.
I wish I had installed here
writing novels
and not to have me convicted in
that chain of scripts for films...
It would send to hell, the Beverly Hills House,
the swimming pool and all in one second.
But watch. This is where Monet
He lived and painted...
We are 30 minutes from the city!
Imagine the 2 instalándos here.
We could do, if my book came out well.
You are in love with a fantasy.
I'm in love with tí.
We should go back to Paris, today
We lunch with my parents.
We are going beyond.
There are our pilgrims.
If I return to see another charming Boulevard
sure it is.
I I am living here.
I feel that I sintonizo with the Parisians.
I see already walked out there, with a
baguette under his arm...
the Café de Flore, direction
to dive me in my book.
It is called by Heminghway,
"a mobile party"
With this traffic,
that does not move anything.
Toast by the new project
John in Paris.
Bless you... Bless you...
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.
Well... I'll be very frank.
I am very excited about this merger
between ours and the French...
but the truth is that...
I am not very "francophile".
John hates his policy.
Is that have never been friends of
the United States.
Anyway you can not blame them
for not going to the cave of mice of Iraq...
Please let's not start...
Please. Is not bad to your father
and I discrepemos...
Your father defends the right wing
the Republican party...
and I think that it must be
almost crazy cutlass, but...
Okay, okay...
No, no. This does not mean that we do not respect
our silly views, right?
You know what? Eludamos we talk about that,
and talk about the plans of wedding, Yes?
-Do Inés?
-Does Paul and Carol?
-Do that here?
-You guys do here?
Paul and Carol Bates,
I present my parents.
Delighted to meet you.
And of course they know to Gil.
But not me dijistes you were here?
No, but it was suddenly. Paul called
for a Conference in the Surbone.
-Sorbonne.
-Sorbonne
What wonder!
Dad to come for business,
and we decided to come from castings.
Fantastic we can go together.
Well, we have many commitments,
but surely...
What...?
Hey, that this morning?
We are going to Versailles.
Oh, I'm dying to go to Versailles.
But, is that tomorrow we will go to
a meal at the "Brasserie Lipp".
Oh, Yes, if. I already fixed it.
I had a professor who dined there,
and saw James Joyce.
It is like a million years, and was
eating meat and Frankfurters.
and so the end of the story?
More than a story,
It is an anecdote.
-We'd love to go to Versailles.
-Great.
I hope you're not so antisocial
tomorrow in Versailles.
What I've been antisocial?
Looked... was very clear
that you not wanted to go.
Well, well, they are friends of yours.
And it does not fall so nice
as you fall to tí.
It is a genius! It was crazy
by him in the University.
-Carol is also very intelligent.
-It is a pseudo intelligent.
Gil... do not think that you're talking about in
the Sorbonne, being a pseudo intellectual.
Dale to read your book.
But, why?
Because maybe you can check your work,
and thus tell you why
It costs you both.
Me cuesta tanto, because I am
an escritorzuelo of Hollywood...
.. .that was never actually released to
the literature so far.
Gil... love...
promise me one thing.
as if that book comes out,
you let eat coconut...
and you'll still doing better
you know.
Because the film studios
you love, you requested,
Really wanna leave everything?
to start from scratch?
Good...
Why you were going to do that?
I remember Luis moved
his court here, in 1682.
In reality all of this before
they were swamps, and in old French,
Versailles means "land where"
"been uprooted weeds"
I seriously?
This central section is of
French classical style.
They are works of Louis Le Vau,
Jules Mansart, and the same Charles Le Brun.
Exact.
I was a little House of
summer like this.
-Sure.
-I also.
Remember that at that time only had
bathtubs, and I am a man of showers.
Where you think when moving?
you marry?
-To Malibu.
-To a small bohardilla...
in Paris with a large skylight.
-Just need to tuberculosis.
-Exact. Thank you.
Well, you see, is that he is not really
safe to write a novel.
I seriously?
Good love is so far
your background, are... anyway...
Everyone loves their films.
Why not speak them of the protagonist?
that work now?
Ah... not like me to talk about
of my work.
Don't need to tell you all the
argument, only the character.
-No, no. -Well... It works in one
nostalgia store.
What is a store of nostalgia?
Don't tell me that it is one of those that
sell Shirley Temple dolls,
and old radio devices.
-Exact.
Never have known who purchase it.
Who cares? -I know not.
As to people living in the past.
People who believe that it would have been happier,
If he had lived years ago.
And at what time you have?
preferred live you, Don Quixote?
Paris 20 years.
When was the rain not acidic.
I understand, without global warming,
Neither television nor nuclear weapons...
.. .ni drug cartels.
-The classic of the horror stories.
The case is that nostalgia is denial.
Denial of the painful present.
The fact is that Gil is a romantic fool,
because he would be happy,
living in the total State
perpetual denial.
and the name of this fallacy is,
the complex of the golden age.
-Oh. touché!
-Yes.
It is the misconception that a
different time period,
It is better than live us.
Do you understand?.
It is the failure of the romantic imagination
of these people,
that costs
faced with the present.
If. It is the most beautiful
I have seen.
Diamond wedding ring.
It is what you need to buy.
And everyone will see it.
Up from the last Bank,
When he put it me on the finger.
Everyone will be happy.
-Hopefully the outside...
-I do not want to discuss it.
-Your have chosen, I'm going to say.
-No, Gil is intelligent,
and now he has success.
But is talking about leaving everything,
and moving here.
-If he says that.
-Well, that I fear gives.
This is of course the statue
most famous.
Put a copy of this work together with their
Tomb. Rodine wanted of tombstone,
and also on epitaph.
-Is that true?
If it is true, and if I am not mistaken
It was in 1917.
-Is very knowledgeable, eh?
-If.
Many works of Rodine, were
inspired by his wife, Camille.
If she inspired him but Camille was not
his wife, but her lover.
-Rose was his wife.
-No, he never married Rose.
-Yes, married the last year of his life.
-I think that it is wrong.
-You carry the opposite to the Guide.
-Yes, that I do.
No, I'm sure
for this reason, Messie.
Yes, the truth that she is right.
I recently read a biography,
in the volumes of Rodine and Rose
was his wife and Camille her lover.
Do your have read where?
you read that?
Yes, I just read it, and I was surprised,
because I thought it was, as you thought.
It is easy to be confused.
Invited them my dad to one?
tasting of wines?
Oh if it's fun. Paul is
a French wine expert.
-Be prepared. Very well.
-Oh... an expert.
When you read one?
Rodine biography?
-Can I?
-If.
Why I was going to read?
do a biography of Rodine...?
You see, I have always made wine in California
but the Napa Valley is 7 km away.
Hello as you are?
-Are we going?
-I can't stand that kind.
And if we catamos more wine?
-If. Let's here.
-What you prefer these?
I believe that we need to start
to be scientific,
and begin to return to take them
all over again. I do not know...
Why are you so red?
Of which you speak? I am not
as colorado.
Coloradísimo.
It can be by pheromones you expulsas.
You know pheromones get me active!
-Ajá... sex and alcohol.
-Yes.
Turn on the desire, but
kill performance.
Have you tried the of 61?
It is divine.
Paul has chosen.
What? What, what?
One Pike of tannin
than the 59.
-I prefer more, one of these.
-I agree.
We are a few inches reactivated...
Carol and I we are going to go dancing to a
great site. Are you interested?
-Well... Yes...
-No, I do not want to be a spoilsport.
-I need a bit of free air.
- But come!
No, no, no.
You're going to sit there, obsessed by
where are the emergency exits.
But if he doesn't want to go, I will share to Paul
with you. I am democratic here.
And Paul is a wonderful dancer.
No, no, no. There is no problem for me.
It makes me want to give a paseíto
.. .irme to bed, and go
another night.
Very well, but...
do I can go, no?
Do you want to go?
Well Yes... Yes!. It is that I am not tired
and I'm wanting to dance.
-Now we will find in the hotel.
-In agreement.
I connection well of it.
I stop a taxi.
Not bad. But you tomato a taxi.
-No, no. I do not take taxi. I'll go on foot.
- But you will lose.
Not bad. I'm going to walk.
Hey. Is it good writer?
Have you ever seen your texts?
Good. Not left reading to anyone.
Do not left read anyone?
If you want to, I can read their
novels, and do a critique.
-It would be great.
-Yes.
-Do you know? I think you need.
-It always helps.
The need that someone will read.
You do not you callarías any error.
Of course it I not callaría.
You know that do not.
I am sure of that.
The trouble is that when it comes to writing
not feel less respect...
in the opinion of others.
Clear that do not.
-Eh, sorry. Parlez-Vous Spanish?
-No. not.
Hotel Bristol.
(Midnight chimes)
-Allez!
-Eh. I did not hear them.
Let's go! Come! Get into the car.
No, not friends.
I think they are confused.
-Allez!. We will rise.
What? I do not understand them.
I'm slightly drunk.
It is an old Peugeot? I have a friend
that he collects them in Beverly Hills.
Let's go. Let's go. Take a drink.
Come party with us.
At the party?... Good.
We will... feel here.
To stroll through Paris. Let's go!
Very well, and now,
where have I been?
Huy, tonight I have already
drunk much wine.
And now champagne!
<i>Let's fall in love</i>
<i>In Spain the best upper - sets do it.</i>
<i>Lithuanians and Letts do it</i>
<i>Let's do it, let's fall in love.</i>
There you can go, if you want to.
<i>The Dutch in old Amsterdam, do it.</i>
<i>Not to mentions the Finns;</i>
<i>Folks in Siam, do it - think of Siamese twins.</i>
<i>Some Argentines, without means, do it,</i>
<i>People say in Boston even beans do it,</i>
<i>Let's do it, let's fall in love.</i>
<i>Romantic spon-ges they say, do it.</i>
<i>Oyster down in Oyster bay, do it.</i>
<i>Let's do it, let's fall in love.</i>
It seems lost.
If I say... not...
You are not French.
If Alabama is not French
Me neither.
I miss the gin in this celebration.
What is it dedicated?
-Can I? I am a writer.
- And what type?
Therefore, at this time
working on a novel.
Ah, Yes? By the way, I'm Zelda.
Come, come here. Here is a writer...
From where?...
California.
Scott Fitzgerald.
Who are you young?
Gil... You have
the same names as...
What who?
Therefore, as Scott Fitzgerald... and...
Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald...
the Fitzgerald.
-Truth is beautiful.
-Yes... Yes!...
It is a coincidence...
It has an aspect of silly in the eyes...
of esupefacto, antestesiado
down...
No, no, no. I, I, I...
I'm looking at to which plays the piano...
Although they do not create it, recognize your face of
some old sheet music.
I know that I could be a great
lyricist of songs...
and it is not know write music,
Although I try.
and I hear the songs he writes,
and I understand that I will never write...
great lyrics, and that my true
talent... is to drink...
That for sure.
Not wrote the music, right?
Anyway, this is not possible.
Good... and what kinds of books?
He writes?
I am working on one...
where am I?
Oh, sorry, do not know the host?
Among friends, we have organized
a feast for Jean Cocteau.
Hey, love. Take me the hair?
Oh, I know what you think.
This is boring.
And I am ready to go.
We're going to the Dripton Hall.
I I'm bored, he gets bored,
all get bored.
At the Dripton?
So we all get bored.
Why not tell him to Cole and Linda?
to come?
Gil... next?
This is one of the best
establishments in Paris.
Her special whiskey is dynamite.
"Bonsoir toute monde le"
Greetings and tributes. Excuse me, I've been
mixing much malt and too much absenta.
Here is a writer...
Gil... right?
-Gil Pender.
-Hemingway.
Hemingway?
Has my book liked he?
Like me? I was delighted.
All of his work.
If it was a good book,
because he was a truthful book.
That makes war with men...
and there is nothing good and noble
die in the mud,
but you die with dignity.
and then it is not only noble...
but brave.
You've read my story?
What do you think?
Had a few good fragments,
but it failed to germinate.
I knew it horrorizaría you.
Sky. You're too sensitive.
Tí you I liked, but he hates me.
Please girl
You complicas things too.
Maybe I'm going by bus after this.
Bad body. Suddenly not
I like the environment there is here.
Oh! Where are you going?
I'm going to meet with a friend
in the Saint Germain.
-Is it going to Saint Germain, I'm going with him.
-Zelda...
Yes your stay to drink with him,
I me long with the Bullfighter.
You'll want to bring it back?
at a quiet time?
You will be mad that woman.
It's fascinating, and has talent.
This month he writes, last month
It was another thing.
You're the writer, need time to
write and not so much out there.
She wastes you, because it is a competitor.
Do you not think?
-Can I?
-Speaking man,
Do not think that my friend?
you make a tragic mistake?
The truth is I do not know much
the Fitzgerald, so...
It is writer notes...... carries with
them throughout the night.
Yes, but we are not discussing my life
private in public.
It is jealous of the talent from him.
And it is a rare talent.
Do you like his work?
Openly.
Stop it!
You want to stop.
-Like Mark Twain.
-I will look for Zelda.
I do not like to be with the matador.
Allow me to... Yes, I'm a huge fan
by Mark Twain.
I think you can say that all the
Modern American literature...
comes from Huckleberry Finn
It boxea?
No, no, good... not the truth that not.
What he writes?
-A novel.
-On what?
About a man who works in a
Nostalgia store, do you know?
What shit is a store of nostalgia?
A place where to sell old things.
Memorabilia.
and it is that...
Sounds very horrible?
No topic is horrible,
If the story is true.
And if the prose is clean and honest,
and if says...
value and elegance under pressure.
Hear. I would like to ask the
greater favour in the world
What is it?
-You could read it?
-His novel?
Yes. It has 400 pages and I am
looking for... I'm looking for an opinion.
-My opinion is that I hate.
- But if not you have read.
If it is bad, I hate it.
Hate bad literature.
And if it is good, I envidiaré and her hate most.
Don't ask the opinion of another writer.
If... What happens is...
is that I can hardly trust
in that her someone well evaluated.
-Writers are competitive.
-I will not be competitive with you.
I is adulando.
That is not of men.
If you are a writer, you have to be the best writer.
But you're not going to argue with me here.
-Or want to be in a ring?
-No, I don't want to...
I am not going to read his novel.
But you know what I will do?
-What?
-Is her turn to Gertrude Stein.
I can only trust it, in my novels.
You teach my novel Gertrude Stein?
-Give me her.
-Yes, of course, is her I will bring.
-Morning when again from Spain.
-Great, I'll look it up.
You don't know how excited I am.
This pleased me so much,
that my heart beats to 100 per hour.
What will happen with the...?
Well, well, I will look it up.
Oh, Gil, quiet, quiet, this is good.
You have a great night.
Fitzgerald, Hemingway, my master.
You have to...
He did not say where
We will find.
How lucky that not vinistes last night.
You'd hated music.
and the public.
But I had fun.
Where do you think? It seems that
you are in the clouds.
What would you say if this evening that happened...?
.. .the have happened with Ernest Hemingway,
and Scott Fitzgerald.?
You've dreamed again?
with your literary idols?
But, if I was not dreaming?
What is that?
And if I had been with Hemingway,
Fitzgerald and Cole Porter
Because you think a brain tumor.
I can tell you that Zelda Fitzgerald, is accurate
as we have known in the books,
and in the articles, it is lovely...
but multipolar.
You cannot see Hemingway or in painting,
and Scott knows that he is right about Zelda.
But you understand what tormented
It is because he wants to.
Come on, get up.
Let us say nonsense,
because we are going to be late.
Well, I think I'll be
to work on my novel,
because I want to Polish it a bit more.
No. You can do so later. MOM says
that I take advantage of your discount of Decorator.
Get up.
Watch this Ines. It is well beautiful
in that House in Malibu.
How much does Mr?
18,000 euros.
Thank you.
-How much cost?
-A bargain, 18 thousand dollars.
18 thousand dollars for this?
Hopes are euros, so it would be like...
20, would be as 20 thousand dollars.
I know, but it is very difficult to find
in America, something well.
She is right, Gil.
Remember that we have not yet found
a House, and seek to cut expenses,
to avoid having to accept jobs
exahustos, and do so many scripts
Good, but are nice.
You pay for what you get.
How cheap is cheap.
They would like to go walk?
Do walking? No, it started to rain.
No, it would be nice to walk
the rain it is precious.
No, there's nothing of precious
walking in the rain.
Do not forget to Ines, this night
We brought them to dinner.
Ah, Yes.
And I also have a great surprise
for tí after dinner.
What is it?
-No. I don't like surprises.
- But you'll love.
Sure that you don't want to?
does walking in the rain?
-Is your last chance.
-Go up!. I'll not walking.
I agree.
-Do not understand it, where are we going?
-Already we have almost come.
We've taken dinner running.
Get ready to have the adventure
amazing that you've ever seen in your life.
-In agreement.
-Where?
This is. Quiet please.
Why carry that original?
from the novel?
Insurance than when you see it
You'll be dumbfounded.
You know that I am never exaggerating things,
and if I say that it is incredible......
Well, of agreement.
But I do not understand.
You ever wonder why I have?
been all day so rare?
-Yes.
-So now you'll find out.
And when the averigues, you wonder
because I have not been even rarer.
Trust me. I know, I know.
Well, I do not know that you bring between hands,
but this is not an incredible adventure.
I'm tired of the gym and the massage,
so I shall take this taxi. Taxi!
Wait, wait, wait.
Hopefully a little more.
Well, if you want to take a walk by the
streets of Paris and explore the night...
agreed, great. But I
I am not in the middle of a book.
But we can wait 10 minutes
more and then...
When to arrive, if I'm asleep,
don't wake me.
What I do wrong?
Unless you have reason
and something I'm doing wrong.
I left that place, a little drunk
but not out of control.
I lost, path, and
then I came up here.
I've lost something.
There are the chimes of midnight...
Hello.
Ah, well, wave Mr. Heminghway.
Well, let me upload.
The mission was to take the Hill.
We were four.
Five counting Vincent, but had
lost a hand to explode a grenade...
and could not fight as
When met him.
And it was young and brave.
And the Hill was encharcated by
the rain, and from the day it had...
many German soldiers, and is
trying to point to the first package,
and with accurate marksmanship, delayed them.
I was afraid?
From what?
Of that shot.
It will not write well,
If you have fear to die.
-Does it have?
-I would say Yes.
I would say that it is my greatest fear
really.
It is something that has happened to all
the men, and all will happen.
I know, I know.
To love a fact
real great woman.
The truth is that my girlfriend
It is quite sexy.
And when he makes love with her?
feel nice and true passion...
and in those moments
will you lose the fear of death?
No, it does not usually happen me.
I believe that love is true
and real, creates a truce with death.
Cowardice is not love,
or not love, it is the same.
When the man who is real
and brave, see face to face death...
as hunters of rhinoceros
know, or Belmonte,
It is brave of truth.
As aman with enough passion,
they depart on the death of his mind.
So again, as it does
with all men.
And it is time to return
to make the love of truth.
Think of it either.
-Does Alice as hell andas?
-Wave. Not bad.
She is here, follow me.
This is Miss Saigon Gil Pender. Stein.
He is a young American writer.
I think they should know.
Luckily. I think you can help us
to find out who the 2 is right.
I said to Paul, that this portrait
It does not capture to Adriana.
You have universality, but
It has no objectivity.
No, no. UD nothing known madame.
You can see that this drawing
It represents exactly his image.
No. It is not right.
Watch as he has done.
Filled with sexual innuendos,
carnal extent to burn...
and yes it is beautiful
But it is a subtle beauty
and implicit sensuality.
See look at it, what is its?
first impression of Adriana?
It is very charming.
He sees it. It has no more output OK.
It is implicit.
Miss Stein, of course.
It has lost all objectivity.
He has painted a being from another side.
A being of volcanic appetites.
No, I don't think so.
But if UD known...
Of course, but if it is your lover...
But if we do not know.
It is a view of the small bourgeois,
turning it into object of pleasure.
This seems more a dead nature,
than a portrait.
No, not.! I do not agree!
And that his book, which I have spoken.
It is this?
-Yes. This.
-Take you a look.
What have you read Heminghway?
No. I leave it to UD
It has always tried my work well.
Return to the past, was the name of the store
and its products consisted of memories.
What was vulgar and prosaic to
a generation
.. .ha been transumtado by
step Age Groupers.
The world is both magical and simple.
I love it.
I am hooked.
Do hooked?.
I will read it tonight.
But before, you and me
We have something to talk about.
I have 2 months waiting for the
response by that editor.
I gave him the material that you and I
We carry out, in addition to other works...
And has been hooked?
for those first lines?
The past has always
great charisma for me.
For me also. It has been
a great charisma for me.
I always say that I was born too late.
Well Yes.
For me the Belle Epoque Paris,
It would be perfect.
-In serious? Better than now?
-Yes.
There was so much sensitivity in
the streets, the kiosks.
Horse cars...
and hundreds of things.
You are very eloquent.
-No, I think that not.
-If... seriously.
How much does is?
hooked with Picasso?
Huy but that is what I said...
Not intended... did not want to fisgonear
Do that ud in Paris?.
Not I came here for a walk.
I came here to study fashion.
But I'm not here to bore him.
No, but I not bored.
Continue. He came here to study fashion.
I came to study fashion
with Coco Channel.
And I fell in love with Paris.
And also of an anguished painter
judío-Italiano, very black eyes.
I knew that Amedeo had another woman, but
I could not stop going to his apartment.
And they were six precious months.
I knew Modigliani... and lived?
with Modigliani?
You asked and I tell him
my sad story.
And I stopped by his wife,
He had many.
And now I'm with Paul.
He is married.
But all his days, since
I'm going, so I come back.
I do not know as there are women who hold it,
It is very difficult.
My god.  You raises a lot the
concept of "Art Groupie".
-As?
-Nothing. I just said.
And UD talk from UD?
I do not know. I can say.
Do you've come to Paris to write?
Because look, today many Americans
feel the need to come to write here.
Truth that Heminghway is attractive?
-I love how she writes.
-Yes, I know.
I am actually only visit.
You have to stay here.
-Yes?
-Yes.
It is a wonderful city for...
writers... artists...
I know. I would like, but
It is not so simple.
And... we have.... I love
madly in his book.
-From truth?
-If you and I want to talk about this.
Since.  It is that we have been tweaking it...
Pender. We are going to take a
I drink to Mont Martre.!
If. If.
We will discuss his book as
finished reading.
-Where can I find?
-I why not return I...?
... so it does not look for me?
If you think about?
-Our House is open.
-Great.
It comes with us.
If. I wish I could, but,
I can't.
-Hope, I hope, to see it again.
-If I wish.
Let's go.
One day I steal this genius
that is fantastic, but it is not a voyeur.
I'm Gil Pender. I've been with
Heminghway and Picasso. Pablo Picasso.
I'm Gil Pender of Pasadena. Boy Scout.
The first in literature.
The small Pender Gil has his novel.
And corrected by Gertrude Stein.
Wow, this girl was a
preciousness.
It is a shame that not
you were you coming to the cinema last night.
We saw an American movie,
brilliant and hilarious.
Whom he starred?
Oh, I don't know. I have forgotten the name.
Great but have forgotten.
Reminds me of a movie I saw.
Sure her wrote I.
Good. I know that it was idiotic and childish,
without the minimum of credibility.
But John and I laugh
Despite that.
-Not have happened before around here?
-In serious?
What time you came last night?
Oh. Very late. These night tours
they are great for me.
Inspire me much creativity, without the
distractions of the day.
I'll probably do another tour
tonight.
-Good. We'll see.
-If. If. We'll see.
-Huy, haven't seen that!
-Check out these beautiful bottles.
-Do you like?
-If. It is precious.
-Where next?
-I am American.
Do you like Cole Porter?
Yes, I love. He boasted of
belong to the intimate group of Linda and Cole.
Just kidding.
Very nice singing.
If it is true.
Gil... Gil...!
-If, if.
-Hey, we have to go.
Now we're going?
We've been with Paul and Carol,
go to the Museum to the private visit
Paul is an expert
in works, so it will be useful.
At culturizar you have called us.
The juxtaposition of color is amazing.
This man was the father of the
abstract expressionism.
I withdraw that, perhaps was Turner.
Because I love Turner,
but this seems irresistible.
If I am not mistaken it took 2 years
to finish this.
and it worked in Giverny.
I understand that Monet, one of
things that used to invent...
Shhh. I want to hear
what he is saying.
.. .where was frequently visited
by Callebaut.
A painter who in my opinion,
It was innovative.
Ah, if. Here is a splendid Picasso.
If I am not mistaken he painted this,
This wonderful portrait
his French mistress, Madeleine
in the 1920s.
Hey Paul, I have to disagree with
of tí in this.
Oye Gil listening and calla, and may
that you learn something.
If I am not mistaken, this was a
failed attempt to capture...
a French named Adriana, if my
history of art doesn't fool me.
He went to Paris to study
Costumes for theatre design.
And I am very sure that he had
an adventure with Modigliani
then with Braque, and then
met when Paul her, Picasso.
Since then what this portrait
you not transmitted,
It is the subtlety of its beauty.
It was like a freight train.
What they've smoked?
I would call it to this picture,
wonderful, is rather an affirmation
It is a petit bonsoir of as sees Picasso.
As he saw it.
Is mad by the fact that she was a
true volcano bed.
Too sticky.
-Where is Gil running?
-To work.
State walking through Paris. Mode
the city is lit up at night,
It is assumed that it inspires him, and...
But it is the same, because I'm going
to go dancing with Paul.
Where is Carol?
At this time he has already gotten into bed.
Good night. See you later.
Thank you for the dinner papi.
-Goodbye treasure.
-Goodbye.
Where does go Gil at night?
You've already heard, take a walk,
collect ideas.
You seem skeptical.
I've seen that plot. But sometimes
It seems that... missing a screw.
And I didn't like your comment
on the Republicans.
They are good people who care
for the recovery of the country.
They are not morons zombies, criptofascistas.
Do you mean oístes?
If. And I don't think that your idea that
you go, be very practical.
I would like to know that it makes the evenings.
One thing is certain.
It will not dance.
I am sorry.
Scott!
How are you?
Not bad. He did not expect to see you here.
This event is great.
Yes, that is.
Christine!
Gil, as we shall see later.
Bonsoir friends.
What a surprise!
If the truth Yes.
I was fixing my novel.
And I said to a type and is
It is Henry Miller.
And I said, we are going to a party
they are the Fitzgerald
and not told me you'd be here.
And what happened to Paul?
... Well we've angered.
And I would say that we should
having gone to a bar...
At a bar? No wonder
that I would like to take.
That is something well macho, right?
And only the Fitzgerald, are able to
make a party as well.
-Follow me.
-In agreement.
- And what about his book?
-The novel? Doing pretty well.
Look at this.
It is from the Belle Epoque.
My favorite time.
I adore this carousel.
I love me too. And me
glad to see you
I am also pleased to see you.
Good night, my dear Adriana.
Do not think that this Parisian dream?
is it a mobile party?
Remember my words,
I'm going to steal it anyway,
the fugitive from Malaga.
Between me, and Belmonte
who would?
I could not tell him.
He is more brave. Is Vally
with the death more often.
And if chose it to him, that
I decide, but I will take it.
She has chosen to Paul.
If chose to Pablo Picasso. But
Paul believes that women,
they are only for bed
or to paint them.
And do you think?
I believe that the woman is
equal to men in courage.
Has he shot a lion attacking?
-No.
-Would you like to experience it?
-I think that not.
-It has gone to hunt?
-No.
- And you?
Only by rewards.
Come on, get another glass.
We can go to a site,
where can think a little.
Good bye.
Who wants to fight?
I hope that the fight with Paul
It wasn't something serious.
It is variable and possessive.
It is so often.
It is not clear, because all of them
they want to paint.
When you are one of the faces
most beautiful I've seen.
Moreover, it is so interesting...
What...
You are also interesting.
-With its lost air.
-Is lost?
I guess I'm lost.
Tell me more of his book.
My book is a kind of....
Do you know what?...
Tonight my book doesn't matter to me in
absolute. I want to walk in Paris with you.
I always forget that UD is a tourist.
That is, be short.
I've never known if Paris is more beautiful
day or night.
It is not known. You can not choose. Finally, I can
give an emphatic reason every moment.
Look at. Sometimes I think of that can
someone, creating a book or a painting...
or a symphony or a sculpture that
It can compete with a large city.
Does not exist.  Because looking around
each street, each Boulevard,
It has an art form in itself.
And think that in this cold universe
violent and absurd, there is Paris
and this clearly, good,
I don't know, nothing in Jupiter or Neptune happens.
But from the distance of space
are these lights, cafes
people drinking, singing. Finally it is possible to
that Paris is the most important point of the universe.
It is a good poet.
Or thanks is very gentle. But I I
I would call an a poetry.
Although I was nevertheless developing
pretty well.
Tell me there are some women who dislike him?
I am ashamed to say it, but
I attract all.
I like the sexy. I guess
that that makes me shallow.
When I went to Catholic school,
a weekend, a classmate and I
We pay a girl with experience, for
to come to teach us all his tricks.
-In serious?
-Sip.
Go.... I think it is....
I think I'm going to think about it.
I love to walk with you.
-It is very nice
-Thank you.
My God, is who think it is?
What will be doing there?
so near water?
Zelda, but you do here?
It was with this very beautiful girl.
They were cuchicheando on me.
The more approached it was worse.
No, no. Scott wants to it only to UD
I assure you with absolute certainty.
-No. He has tired of me.
-You make a mistake.
-You make a mistake, I know.
-How? How?
Trust me, I know.
Sometimes you presientes things from someone.
-Hurts the skin. I do not know,
I do not like.   -No, no, no.
Do not do it.
Please, take this.
-What is?
-Is a Valium, it will make it feel better.
And take these medicines?
Usually not, since I'm
committed to Agnes, the
I have had small panic attacks,
but surely that will eventually
After the wedding.
I have never heard talk of Valium.
What is it?
It is the pill of the future.
He had not told me that he was going to marry.
Yes, if. There is still time.
In the future.
Well good luck with the wedding.
If. Thank you.
I would like to INES. It has a
felt very acute love, and is attractive.
But it does not mean that we are
agree on everything. But...
But in the important thing.
Well, in reality in the
small things.
Sometimes there is some disparity
in the important thing.
Well, she wants to live in Malibu,
and I work in Hollywood.
But yes, 2 we like...
Indian food.
Not all Indian food, but
also the pita bread.
2 We like pita bread.
I have to go.
Paul going to miss.
-Accompanied home.
-No, no, no. Finish the Cup.
I live next door.
The truth is that I prefer
being alone a while, I can assure you.
Thanks for the evening, goodbye.
Messie, it is a pity...
Us we have known before.
At a party.
-Dalí, Dalí.
-Now I remember.
-Tráigame another Cup.
-Thank you.
And another Cup for the Lord.
I love it!
This language... Francois!
The waiters... not.
Do you like the way of the rhinoceros?
From rhinos?
Ah. Not what I had thought.
I paint rhinos.
And you... Yes... its sad eyes...
Its huge mouth, melting
on the sand heat.
And a single tear falls... If.
And, in the tear... other side....
The face of Christ!
If... and a rhinoceros...
Yes, certainly look like sad, but
I live a very complex situation.
Here this, Luis... Hey... Luis.
My friends.
-The Buñuel Mr.
-Do Buñuel?
Yes. Buñuel.
And mister Man Ray.
And he is Pender!
Yes. This is...
Penderrrrr!
Yes.
-I am... Dalí.
-Dalí.     -Yes.
-It has to be agreed.
-Yes.
Pender is a complex situation.
Saying thus seems crazy. UDs.
they believe that I am drunk
But to whom I have to explain.
I come from a time different from another era.
In the future. You will see I have come from
the third millennium so far.
I climb into a car, and me
I go by the time.
Exactly correct.
You inhabit 2 worlds.
For now I don't see anything strange.
Good. You are surreal, but I am
a standard rate.
In a life, I'm going to marry a woman
that want to... at least I think that I want to.
It is better for who wants to,
I marry her.
The rhinoceros is always love.
Almost always on the female.
But...  There is a difference.
The beauty between these 2 rhinos.
-Is there another woman?
-If. Adriana.
Good. I feel attracted to her.
Find, intoxicating.
You know, you know, is that other men,
great artists, geniuses,
also find intoxicating.
And she, and they... are... well...
A man in love with a woman
of a different era.
-I see a picture.
-I see a movie.
I see an insurmountable problem.
I see... a rhinoceros...
Last night pudistes work?
If I would... like to think that perhaps my book
is so surreal,
that my imagination enloquezca, and
so, not so logical.
Wow. Why always?
you are so pretty in the morning?
-No, no, no. We have to wear.
-See here.
I have to finish this job,
but I do not refuse to see you this morning.
Paul says that we have to go to the field
You know? says that it will lead to a
beautiful Inn.
But hey... If you don't want to go, do not go.
I I do not lose your fault.
Hello!.... Bonjour.
Hello, I have a quick question
to make you
I understand if the loved his wife
and also her lover.   -Yes.
But he believes that it is possible to love?
to 2 women at the same time?
Good. Loved the 2, but
in a different way.
-Do understand?
-I know that. That is very French.
You are more evolved
to us in that regard.
Not remember me? I was with
This group when he explained about the Tomb.
If. The group with the pedantic Lord.
Siiii. Pedantic. That's the word
perfect. Very well.
Here this the picture.
I want to know where is going at night.
Do you have any suspicion?
It is going to marry my daughter. I want to be
Surely she has made a good decision.
Since then a discretion,
It is vital.
You've come to the right place, Messie.
Messie Rovira, will continue to be personally
the track of the Knight.
And you will be informed of their whereabouts.
Eeehh, please stop.
S. T. Elliot?
People live their lives with
wonders of coca.
Hello, Miss Stein?
Ah, Pender, are now talking about his book.
I finished it.
We are a small personal crisis.
Agreed, I again later.
I don't want to interrupt.
It is no secret. Adriana to left Paul
and has fled to Africa with Heminghway.
I knew that I had an obsession
with this braggart.
We talked about all this.
I am sure that will return delivered.
Very dedicated.
It has led it to hunt, but
It will be with Paul.
The sound of the hyenas at night,
When you try to sleep at the ranch
you crazy.   Mount Kilimanjaro
It is not Paris.
Tell, her has been?
at Mount Kilimanjaro?
Let's talk about his book. It is very strange.
On the one hand it is almost science fiction.
All fear death and
We question our place in the universe.
The task of the artist is not succumb
in desesperos, but a solution
before the emptiness of existence.
And you have a clear and powerful voice.
Not be so defeatist.
Dile Gil, that grip the suit, because
tomorrow night we have a formal dinner.
I forgot to tell you that in the end Gil does not come
Mont Saint Michel.
Why not? Really do not understand.
Because he writes. Re writes, what type
and re write that re writes
Do you understand?. Tells me. Picasso never left
his study, and I say, you do not have
absolutely nothing to do with Picasso.
And is looking at.
Then it will lose a great weekend.
Do you have something of Cole Porter?
-Wave.
-How about?
-I remember you.
-Yes?
Was friend him?
Cole Porter? Siiii. Don't forget to
that of Linda.
-Remember that he only joked.
-If.
I noticed. It is a little young.
If it is true. And you are a little
young man to know his work.
It is because he wrote many songs
about Paris.
And how was your story? Is that it
He fell in love with this town.
You're Parisian?
-Yes, messie.
-Do Yes messie?
If you can call me Gil.
How much is it?
This?   18 euros.
Hey, heard.
Can you translate me this?
Parlez-vous...?
It means what it says here?
Well, well, thank you.
.. .that Paris exists, and that someone can
choose to live rather than in
anywhere else in the world,
It will always be a mystery to me.
Dinner with Paul and Matisse.
Paul is much better artist, but
Matisse is best painter.
Paris in the summer: as it should be.
Sitting down at your lover in
Maxim's in their best times
I'm in love with an American writer
I've known, called Gil Pender
This instant magic of which I speak,
I happened
Is well aware that Picasso and Heminghway,
they are enamored with me.
But for some inexplicable reason,
from the heart, I am attracted to Gil.
Maybe because it seems naive
and also modest
As always in this sad life,
you are about to join in marriage
with a such Inés.
I had a dream in which he appeared
before me, and brought me a gift.
Brought me a pair of earrings, and we made love.
Earrings!
Uuu, what they do?
Dad had a pain in the chest.
Surely that is just indigestion.
We can not risk.
Did you not know he was made one?
Angioplasty for 3 years?
Ah, indeed.
Put me a balloon inside, nonsense.
A balloon?
Hi, yes the Hotel, room 728.
Do not call the doctor.
Gil, why are you so fixed?
I?. You'll see I have been writing
I've only been writing.
What? You you wear well and you get?
Cologne to write?
No, I've got in the shower, because
you know I think better in the shower...
and you know, I put up the
positive ions.
If. And we are going on the way to Mont St. Michel
When has dad been super white
He has given us a scare, and we have
given average around here.
Yes, clear. Hey, John, John, is there something?
who can do for you?
I would say that you have good color,
but I am not a doctor.
Nooo. I am fine. Sure
It is the Champagne that forced me to take.
What is that?
So what?
What you have in your hand?
There is nothing.
-It is a gift.
-I know, I know.
Yes, it is... but,
It is good...
Pour moi?
Well, Yes, no. In the end,
It is a flea market.
I open it?
But not. It is what said you love.
Is for a special dinner that we
do you and I will give it to you.
It is a jewel?
I hope that my taste. Because that
necklace of zirconium
Did you know that you didn't like zirconium?
It is discreet yet elegant.
This is what you always say.
While is not cheap.
You have not seen the necklace, the truth is that
never what I have.
I will show and you'll see that...
Suddenly to everyone not
like zirconium.
I thought that you loved the simplicity.
If that is the problem, too
single.
Well, that is, if it is simple.
And my pearls earrings?
Of pearl earrings, has brought them?
I don't remember you metieras them.
If I put them, I put them here.
Because if they aren't, they should have fallen.
The two? They are for pierced ears.
I told you so metieras all in the
safe room.
-Do you think that it has been the waitress?
-It is always the waitress.
This morning I have seen here.
I denunciaría the theft immediately.
You know? yesterday raised eyebrows, when
I told him to open the boxes.
We start to draw conclusions
Do not make accusations if...
I would like to report a theft.
-Inés, no.
You want to notify the hotel detective
and send it here
It is a witch hunt. It is not
This people.
Yes it is if they have stolen.
I didn't like the waitress.
No I liked from the beginning.
It was friendly, it was nice.
You always get part of the other.
Why Dad calls you a Communist.
Thanks to God.
Bonsoir, I am the Doctor
Gerard.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Thank you.
He was made an angioplasty...
Ignore you.
Are these?
They could be.
Where you found them?
They were there, in the bathroom.
-In the bathroom?
-If, on the pool.
And what the hell did in the bathroom, if I...?
Because they were there. Perhaps you have fallen
When were you saving them
and there will be picked up by the waitress.
Finally, to make see them.
I has not fallen.
The important thing is that they have appeared,
and have not stolen them
I agree what you want...
and him will I repay what UD asks me
Ah, Pender, told him to Matisse
I buy
one of his new paintings
for our collection.
-I think 500 francs okay.
-500 francs for a Matisse.
If not beat.
If I'm thinking if I could
take 6 or 7 of these tables...
What we have here?
If I bring the revision of the first chapters
in my book, and if UD tell me
If I'm going in the right direction,
It would be grateful.
Déjemo see it.
And it has Heminghway news?
He has returned to again, and the journey
It went wrong, and there was no good friends.
Ended, and Picasso also.
She is alone, in De Roulle. Oh one of those
crazy surrealist painters.
They celebrate it there. He is glad to see him.
Oh. What do you here?
I've been looking for you.
In seriously?
If. This is good, but let's say you can
as writer understand some things,
and well, I understand that there are some
feelings that are complicated.
and some that perhaps your
you feel for me.
Already not going to get married?
Well, you see, now everything is
a little in the air.
I don't know what will happen.
Is there somewhere where we can talk,
be less noisy.
-Clear.
-We are going.
UY, Mr Buñuel, I have a good
idea for a good film.
A group of people attending a dinner
very elegant, and at the end of the dinner,
they try to get out of the room and cannot.
Why not?
It seems that we are able to
get out of there.
But, why?
One minute. When forced
to stay together the varnish of the
civilization disappears and they,
they remain what they are animals.
Do I not understand it? Why not you?
they get up and go?
I only say that you think. Perhaps one day
shaving his him turn the bulb.
I do not understand.
What he retains them in the living room?
But what does?
I do not know. I really do not know.
But I have felt for a moment
as if he were immortal.
Well, you see very sad.
Because life is very mysterious.
These are the times we live.
Everything happens very quickly.
And life is noisy and complicated.
But I have been, in short, always
I have been a logical person...
I have never committed Follies.
Not the first time I stayed in Paris
I came, I did not.
Not I took seriously what is
be a writer, but a simple
pawn of Hollywood, and not,
and I didn't, I don't know,
I think what I want is to leave everything.
Ten.
That is, this is amazing.
-You place them.
-They are precious.
Mira...
Messie, Madmoiselle,
come here.
Who are you?
Come on, come for a walk.
Oh, mon dieu, this is beautiful.
It is amazing, with all the pictures I've seen.
And here is, the Belle Epoque.
Do not know to say about this city?
I have been riding on float
and now I'm going to eat...
Welcome.
-Welcome
-Thank you.
Oh, mon dieu, elegant are.
I have not seen anything like.
We serve champagne.
Truth is incredible. The first
time we were talking about
the Belle Epoque, and here we are.
I do not know because I have a feeling...
I don't know, I can't believe my luck.
At this point, I know exactly
where I want to go.
I guide you.
-Oh.
-It is incredible.
Mira... Paul so much admired.
I have to say hello
But we should not bother him.
But he is a man who feels alone.
Surely the love to have company.
Therefore, we are there.
Messie Lautrec?
Yes?
Bonsoir, we are delighted to see him.
Thank you madame.
Please sientense.
Invites us to sit
Yes, I learned some French in Pasadena.
At the University.
-You are from America.
-If I'm from America.
Did you like dancing?
Yes, Oui, Oui.
I am very happy to see it.
I love your drawings
They are Gauguin and Legard.
Glad, Paul Gauguin.
What drawings, nobody has drawn as well.
Picasso or Matisse.
He understands what we are saying?
No, I speak well.
He speaks.
Legard and I were talking about that
This generation is with lack
imagination.
He says that this generation is empty,
and that he has no imagination.
It would be better to have lived during
the Renaissance.
No!  This is the golden age.
-Insurance
-Secure
What is what you do in Paris?
I make clothing design.
He says that he can present a friend to
designing costumes for his new ballet.
Ballet costumes?
My god. I do not live here.
Well Yes, but...
It is better to not go into many details.
We are passing temporarily.
I would like to talk to you a moment.
Allow me to?
Wow, that have not taken
much like you.
Not back to the 1920s.
And that is?
Stay us here
It is the beginning of the century, and the best time
and most beautiful that Paris has known.
Yes, but I say of the 1920s
And the charlestone, and the Fitzgerald
and the Heminghway, I love those people.
But it is present.
And it's boring.
Bored?
It is not my present.
I am 2010
What you're talking about?
I've leaned his head to your time,
in the same way as you and I
We have come here.
In seriously?
I was out of my mind, as
you try to escape from yours, to a golden age.
Do not upset that the 1920s?
they are a golden age?
So yes, for me they are.
Because I'm from the 1920s, and can
make sure that the golden age
It is the "Belle Epoque".
But look at those people, for them
the Renaissance was the golden age.
They would change, in short, the Belle Epoque
to go to paint to Titian and Michelangelo
And these last 2 would think it would be
much better when it was Cole Lacan.
And now I turn on a light...
It is a low voltage lighting but...
It explains the anxiety of the dream I had.
What is dream?
The other night, I had a dream,
a nightmare in which I was
without sitromax, and then went to the dentist
and not had nodocaína...
Do you understand? Those people still
has no antibiotics
Do you know what?
you're talking about?
Adriana, if you stay here, and this
becomes your present
You will see soon, you begin to
imagine another time,
It is actually your golden age.
Thus, this is what we call present.
It is somewhat unsatisfactory because life
is somewhat unsatisfactory
This is bad writers
They are full of words. But I'm
more emotional.
And I'll be living in Paris, at the time
more glorious forever.
You have chosen once leaving Paris
and then the lamentastes.
If I regretted it, it was a bad decision.
But at least it was a decision.
A decision of truth.
As of now it seems, in short,
crazy, and I do know,
If you want to write something, something that is worth
the penalty, I have to do without my illusions
and the ability to become happier in the past,
It is surely one of them.
Then... goodbye Gil.
Good bye.
Pender, I have read your correction and goes by the
track. I understood very well.
If the rest of the book reads well,
It will have done something valuable.
This is great news. Since then I did case
and I am happy to know that I'm moving.
The truth is everything to me than UD
to read.
Heminghway also read and believe that it will
to be a great book,
but I suggest a change in the argument.
What is suggesting?
Cannot creeer that the protagonist does not
You can see that his girlfriend,
He is having an affair,
in front of their noses.
How?
With another character, the pedantic.
Denial is called.  Thank you.
You are crazy? Paul and I.
Where can you get this nonsense?
From where? Of Ernest Heminghway.
He imagined. And everything makes sense.
Gil, your brain tumor has become
the attack. No, no.
There is no possible Madness with Heminghway or
Fitzgerald, and Gertrude Stein or Salvador Dalí.
Yes. Only that all of them are
dead years.
No, no. The past is not dead.
In reality neither happened.
Do you know who said it? Fowler.
And he was right.
And I also met him, I found
with him at a dinner.
-Gil, you're mad.
-I am not.
If you are.
No. I am too confident, I am jealous
and too confident
A cognitive dissonance. Scott
Fitzgerald spoke of it.
Gil, Gil.
Agnes, can mislead me me, but
to Heminghway not.
That thing! I am talking to a madman
Well, Yes, I did. I was with Paul
a few nights.
Because he is very romantic, French-speaking
and you always work...
Perhaps the mystique of this cheesy city
but
 overcome it Gil....
Now you'll see with perspective to return.
I am not going to return.
Sorry, what?
I stay here.
And has nothing to do with your
Adventure romance, Paris is Paris.
And you and I are... is clear
I don't think that we should be made
the one for the other.
What?
I think that not...
What are you saying? But what you're talking about?
This is great.
You're ready for bathing.
Wave.
We are breaking.
What?
If. Gil will come to live in Paris.
I knew, I told you so.
But what happens?
I'm going to stay in Paris, only
because we have...
If I am not happy will return, but
for now, I am.
With whom? With whom Gil?
With these amiguchos yours?

MOM was right with you, you know?
you are missing a screw.
I told you first.
With what protagonist thinks, which is
win life selling toy guns.
I am fine.
I think you're better without me,
I say this seriously.
I believe that there has hit the nail.
I can't believe.
Go ahead.
Kick you streets, muddle of light
Paris and its roofs.
Well, goodbye Inés.
Memories behind Gil.
You know?
I did a detective to follow him
I knew he ominously something shady.
-You did that?
-Of course I did.
I saw him getting into a car every night
and followed closely
And what happened?
I do not know. The Agency said that
the detective has disappeared.
Who are you?
I'm lost, I took the wrong path.
Guards! Guards!
They cut the head.

Hey, Hello.
Hello.
Go.
That joy verte.
But what you do here?
I come from dinner with friends.
Well, well.
I live there.
And you, you do here?
Therefore, I have gone for a walk.
The truth is that I have decided
moving to Paris.
-From truth?
-If.    -Go.
Sure you'll love.

My boss received another album of Cole Porter.
- And that made you think of me?
-If.
I like that that make you think of me.
