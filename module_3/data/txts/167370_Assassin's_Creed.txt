The Inquisition has finally delivered
Spain to the Templars.
Sultan Muhammad and his people
still hold out in Granada.
But if his son, the Prince is captured...
he will surrender the city
and the Apple of Eden.
Do you Aguilar De Nerha
swear to honor our Order
in the fight for freedom?
To defend mankind
against the Templars' tyranny
and preserve free will?
I swear.
If the Apple falls into their hands
the Templars will destroy everything
that stands in their way.
Protest, dissent,
our right to think for ourselves...
Swear to me that
you will sacrifice your life
and the lives of everyone here
to keep it from them.
Yes, mentor.
Our own lives are nothing.
The Apple is everything.
The spirit of the eagle,
will watch over the future.
Where other men blindly follow the truth
remember...
Nothing is true.
Where other men are
limited by morality or law
remember...
Everything is permitted.
We work in the dark to serve the light.
We are Assassins.
Shit.
Mom?
Dad?
Your blood is not your own, Cal.
They found us.
Live in the shadows.
Go! Go, now!
You here to save my soul?
Something like that.
I understand it's your birthday.
Yeah.
The party's just getting started.
Sit down. You're making me nervous.
"Oh, Lord, wash away my sin...
"and I'll be clean...
"once again."
You're not much for the Bible, are you?
Be it known that Callum Lynch ...
has been found guilty of capital murder...
and is sentenced to die on this day...
October 21st, 2016.
Does the prisoner wish to make
a final statement?
Tell my father I'll see him in hell.
My name is Dr. Sofia Rikkin.
At 6:00 p.m. yesterday evening...
you were executed and pronounced dead.
Insofar as anyone in the world
knows or cares...
you no longer exist.
It's better that you sit.
My eyes.
What you're feeling right now is normal,
if uncomfortable.
Cal...
I'm here to help you.
And you're here to help me.
Let him go.
Don't touch him.
Go ahead, do it.
Jump.
You're not a prisoner here, Cal.
I'm here to protect you.
If you listen to me,
everything is going to make sense.
But you need to trust me.
Where am I?
You're in a rehabilitation wing
of the Abstergo Foundation in Madrid.
A private organization dedicated
to the perfection of humankind.
With your help...
we can pioneer new ways
to eradicate violence.
I had this.
Your father wants him in.
He's my patient. This is my program.
Prepare the Animus.
-Are the blades prepared?
-Right here.
And we've confirmed their provenance?
They belonged to Aguilar,
recovered at his burial site.
What are these?
Assume final preparations.
Our regression...
<i>Andalucía,</i> 1492. Record everything.
Arm's ready.
What is this?
I'm sorry, Cal.
This is not the way I like to do things.
Then don't do it.
Insert epidural.
What do you want from me?
Your past.
Listen to me carefully, Cal.
You're about to enter the Animus.
What you're about to see,
hear and feel...
are the memories of someone
who's been dead for 500 years.
Wait a minute!
You can't change what happens, Cal.
Engage scanner.
Status?
Scanning DNA chains.
Searching for time frame.
First memory match locked.
DNA match identified.
Stay with it, Cal.
Attempt synchronization.
We found him.
We found Aguilar.
Synchronization achieved.
There.
Commence regression.
Our mission is the boy.
It's the Prince.
Which household harbored the boy?
I alone.
Nobody else knew he was there.
Hang his family and make him watch.
Burn the whole village.
With the Prince of Granada as captive
his father the Sultan
will surrender his rebellious city
the last safe haven for the infidels.
God will punish his people's heresy.
Finally Spain will be
under one Templar rule.
Stay with the memory, Cal.
Aguilar!... The boy, Aguilar....The boy
Aguilar! The child!
Pull him!
Commence rehabilitation.
Run a systems check and log his condition.
You did well, Cal.
<i>Looking back, it's clear
that the history of the world..</i>.
<i>is a history of violence</i>.
<i>Last year, the economic impact
of antisocial behavior..</i>.
<i>was $9 trillion</i>.
<i>We believe that man today experiences..</i>.
<i>a measure of aggression..</i>.
<i>for which he finds no acceptable outlets</i>.
<i>Now imagine..</i>.
<i>if all these costs
could be channeled elsewhere..</i>.
So the regression went well?
Lynch is the one.
A direct descendant of Aguilar.
Everything was clear in there
for the first time.
<i>...what we all dream of..</i>.
<i>a more peaceful world</i>.
I see you stole my lines again.
I only steal from the best.
And the Artifact?
The Apple.
It's within our grasp.
What happened in there?
Why did you pull him?
I had to.
We have to keep him healthy.
Earn his confidence.
And I know he'll lead us to it.
Push him.
That's not how the Animus works.
Here you go.
Thank you.
1917, Rutherford splits the atom.
1953, Watson and Crick
find the double helix.
2016...
my daughter finds the cure for violence.
You've always been brighter than me.
Now I'm late.
I have to report to the Elders.
Francisco Rizi's Grand Inquisition...
1492.
War, religious persecution...
and the closest Father Torquemada,
or any of our Order...
came to finding the Apple of Eden.
How are you, my friend?
Well...
Your Excellency.
Next week when the Elders meet...
we shall vote to discontinue
your Abstergo project.
We feel that giving you three billion
annually would be better spent elsewhere.
Three billion is nothing compared to...
We've won.
People no longer care about
their civil liberties.
They care about their standard of life.
The modern world has outgrown notions
like freedom.
They're content to follow.
The threat remains...
while free will exists.
For centuries, we've tried,
with religion, with politics...
and now consumerism...
to eliminate dissent.
Isn't it time we gave science a try?
My daughter is closer
than we've ever been.
How is your beautiful daughter?
She has traced
the protectors of the Apple.
Where?
<i>Andalucía,</i> 1492.
The descendants?
All the bloodlines have died out.
Bar one.
We've traced his back 500 years...
<i>to the Assassin's Brotherhood</i>.
The hallucinations are what we call
the Bleeding Effect.
Images of your regression...
layer themselves over your present-day
field of vision.
If you allow me...
I can teach you how to control them.
Stand down. I have this.
Let her be.
What is it? The machine?
It's genetic memory.
By using the Animus...
we can relive lives of those
who made us who we are.
What I saw in there...
it felt real.
It was.
In a way.
Don't mess with me.
I feel different now.
Why the aggression?
I'm an aggressive person.
What kind of prison is this?
It's not a prison, Cal.
You'll learn more if you cooperate.
Let me go.
I'm hungry.
Come with me.
What is this?
I know everything about you, Cal.
Your medical data,
your psychological profile...
the mutations in your MAOA gene.
I know about the foster homes,
the juvenile halls.
You're living proof of the link
between heredity and crime.
How did you find me?
We found Aguilar.
And when you were arrested,
your DNA matched his.
Who's Aguilar?
Your ancestor.
His family were Assassins.
They were burned at the stake
by the Templars, Torquemada...
and the black knight you saw, Ojeda.
Aguilar took up the Assassins' cause.
Do you get out much?
More than you.
And the others in here...
are they lab rats too?
They're Assassins.
Murderers, like their ancestors.
Like you, Cal.
All born with a predisposition to violence.
Murderer?
You killed a man.
A pimp.
Would you kill again?
Happy families.
She must be very proud.
I wouldn't know.
She was killed by an Assassin.
Like your mother.
Sorry.
My old man killed my mother.
And how does that make you feel?
Like killing him.
Either we let it affect us
for the rest of our lives...
or we do something about it.
You turned to violence...
I turned to science.
It's the Apple of Eden, Cal.
I believe it exists.
The Bible tells us it contained the seed
of man's first disobedience.
But there are those of us who believe...
that God, or some ancient civilization...
has left us a road map to understand
why people are violent.
Aguilar was the last person
known to have had it in his possession.
We need you to find out where he hid it.
I thought I was here to be cured.
Violence is a disease, like cancer.
And, like cancer...
we hope to control it one day.
Violence is what kept me alive.
Well, technically, you're dead.
I'm hungry.
What's in it for me?
Once my research is complete...
there is no reason to keep you here.
I get my life back?
Better.
A new one.
You're hungry.
You don't know who he is,
what he is.
That's a dangerous man.
Give him a little more time, Emir.
The man might prove to have
some noble blood in him yet.
How about here, sir?
It's an open menu,
but we do recommend the chicken.
What can I get you, Mr. Lynch?
It's an open menu,
but we do recommend the chicken.
I'll have steak.
Steak for the pioneer.
Who are you?
They call me Moussa.
But my name is Baptiste.
I'm dead 200 years now.
Voodoo poisoner.
I'm harmless.
They're watching you.
Waitin' to see who you are, pioneer.
Have you met him yet?
Have you met him yet?
We are the last to protect the Apple,
my friend.
Make the wrong choice...
you gonna send us all to infinity.
This...
belongs to you.
<i>Progress requires sacrifice</i>.
You're gonna lead them right to it.
No. I'm going to eat it.
<i>In quality, find peace</i>.
What the fuck is going on?
He has to go back in the Animus.
Now.
He needs more time
before he goes in again.
We don't have time.
Why?
I won't risk his life.
Then I'll have to find
someone else to do it.
You're up, slugger.
I'm crazy.
<i>I'm craz</i>y
<i>Crazy for feeling so lonel</i>y
They're getting him back in again.
Then we should stop him
before he betrays us.
-Set the date for the 6th.
<i>-Why do I let myself..</i>.
-If his condition deteriorates, pull him out.
<i>-...worry</i>?
-Your father...
-I don't care what my father said.
<i>What in the world did I do</i>?
Cal, listen to me.
Listen to me!
<i>-Crazy for trying</i>
-You have to stay with Aguilar.
<i>Crazy for cryin</i>g
Stay in sync with him
or it could be dangerous.
<i>And I'm crazy for loving yo</i>u
Soon they will march on Granada.
Sultan Muhammad is weak.
He'll surrender the Apple and betray
the Creed for the Prince's life.
Love makes us weak.
I would gladly sacrifice my flesh and
my blood so that the Creed lives on.
When I die today don't waste your tears.
The Lord spake
and he said
if a man abide not in me
he is cast into the fire
and he is burned.
For decades
you have lived in a land torn apart
by religious discord.
But soon
thanks to God and the Inquisition
we will purge this disease!
The sinners before you
sought to defend
the heretic Prince of Granada
the last heathen stronghold
in our holy war.
And so today
before our King and Queen
I swear that we shall
wash ourselves clean
in the holy fire of God!
Behold God's will!
You will watch your mentor burn
and then you will die the slowest.
Not to ourselves but to the future
give glory.
He's synchronizing.
Damned heretics
don't let them escape!
Go!
Jump!
Complete desynch.
Get him down!
Where are the medics?
It's okay. It's okay, Cal.
Stay with me, Cal.
Stay with me. It's okay. Hurry up!
Okay. Okay. Look at me.
It's okay, look at me.
I can't feel my legs.
The paralysis is temporary.
What's the bad news?
It caused a neurological split,
but we got you through it.
This time.
I'm gonna die in here, aren't I?
No.
Not if you go in there
of your own free will.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
The Apple...
you're the only one left
who can find it.
We can put an end to pain, Cal.
For everyone.
Where'd you get this?
My father recovered it...
from the scene of your mother's murder.
And brought it here for safekeeping.
Safekeeping?
You stole it.
It's your mother's necklace.
I wanted you to have it.
Why was he there?
To save her.
-From who?
-Her own people.
What's it got to do with you?
Assassins and Templars
have been at war for centuries.
I aim to change that.
That's right, I forgot.
We're here to combat aggression.
I don't think I like your methods.
I'm a scientist.
I'm here to be cured of violence.
Who's gonna cure you?
We're feeding the beast.
We're making him stronger.
I'm Dr. Rikkin.
Alan.
I look after things here in Abstergo.
Like to keep things in the family, huh?
Yes.
I'm sorry if we've caused you
any discomfort.
Is there anything I can do?
How about you let me out of here?
That's something I can't manage.
I'm here to make a deal.
We need the Apple.
And we need you to get it for us.
You've been desynching in the Animus.
We need you not to do that.
Sending me back to the machine?
No.
You've already shown us
what we needed to see.
Will you let us free then?
What do you hope to gain
from the newcomer?
Something that'll benefit us all.
You too, Moussa.
What have you done to them?
It's what happens...
if you don't enter
a regression of your own volition.
Do you recognize this?
It's an Assassin's blade.
This is the actual one...
that your father used
to take your mother's life.
He's here, you know.
A mother's death, Cal...
Not something a boy should ever
be made to see.
This is wrong.
You left me no choice.
He has to go in of his own free will,
you said that.
I had to negotiate.
You mean manipulate.
I assured the Elders
we would have the Apple for London.
That's in two days.
He doesn't want to know
his past or his father.
He wants to destroy them both.
We're not in the business
of creating monsters.
We've neither created them
nor destroyed them.
We've merely abandoned them
to their own inexorable fate.
You're your mother's son.
What does that mean?
The blood that flows through you
is not your own.
It belongs to the Creed.
Your mother knew that.
She died so the Creed may live.
Remind me how, exactly.
What you saw...
I did.
You murdered her.
I took her life rather than have it stolen
by that machine.
A man grows with the greatness
of his task.
I ought to have killed you.
I couldn't.
Well, here.
Take it.
Do what you couldn't do 30 years ago.
It's in your hands now, Cal.
This is what they want.
Spill my blood...
but do not go back into the Animus.
Why?
The Apple...
contains the genetic code
for free will.
They will use it to destroy us.
I'm gonna find it...
and watch them destroy you...
and your Creed.
You cannot kill the Creed.
It's in your blood.
The Apple is everything.
Your mother died to protect it.
She had no choice.
I do.
You're gonna kill the Creed!
Take me to the Animus.
Put me in.
Prepare the Animus.
Voluntary regression.
Do you know how Assassins
came to be named?
From an Arabic word.
<i>"Hashashin.</i>"
They were society's outcasts...
those who stole...
who murdered in cold blood.
People ridiculed them.
Rebels, fools, drug addicts.
But they were wise.
They used this reputation...
to hide a dedication to principles...
beyond those
of even their strongest enemies.
And for that...
I admire them.
But you're not one of those men...
are you?
Let's find out.
Commencing regression.
This is my life's work.
It's my life.
For the Creed.
Our own lives are nothing.
All that matters is
what we leave behind.
Sultan...
Surrender the Apple.
Your Assassin protectors are gone.
The Creed is finished.
My son.
Here lies the seed of
man's first disobedience
of free will itself.
Thanks to the Apple of Eden
the known world
will be ushered into a new age
one of peace
in which all the warring
populations of mankind
shall bow in perfect obedience
to our one Templar rule.
The Apple.
Give it to him
now
For the Creed.
Go
Forgive me.
It's over.
Leap of Faith.
Where are we?
It looks like a military port.
Cádiz, Palos de la Frontera.
Assassins have died for this
protect it with your life.
I am a friend of the Creed.
Take it to your grave.
I swear.
What is it? Translation?
"Following the light of the sun,
I shall leave this old world behind."
It's Christopher Columbus.
Where is he buried?
His remains were returned to Spain.
His tomb is in Seville Cathedral.
We found it.
Hey, All Stars. Come here.
Pick one.
Any one.
Breach in the common room!
Seal the Animus.
Is it a memory?
No.
Come on!
Transport?
Standing by.
Protect the Animus.
Purge the facility.
I need to get you out of here first.
No!
We have to leave, Sofia.
No!
No!
You're not alone, Cal.
You never were.
-Wake and bake, my protector.
-Come on.
Where other men...
blindly follow the truth...
remember...
Nothing is true.
Where other men are limited...
by their morality or law...
remember...
Everything is permitted.
We work in the darkness
to serve the light.
We are Assassins.
What now, pioneer?
We fight.
Your Excellency.
All the glory will go to your father.
But we both know who found it.
Your time will come, my child.
They'll give you
a Nobel Peace Prize for this.
Better start writing your speech.
I've read yours.
And?
"If we eradicate free will,
we eradicate the Assassins...
"the cancer that has menaced society
for centuries."
It's not my best work...
but it gets the point across.
We've been looking for solutions.
You've eliminated the problem.
So my program...
Has brought order to society
for the first time.
I'm accountable for this.
You've already been accounted for.
Our work belongs to the Elders.
This is their finest hour.
You lied to me.
I've always known that in your heart...
you were a scientist first
and a Templar second.
Your recent work
has impressed us much...
but it has confirmed our belief
that mankind...
cannot be redeemed.
So you've thought of everything.
Not quite. My speech...
it could do with one of your
elegant openings.
"Now I am become death...
"the destroyer of worlds."
Not sure I could make that work.
<i>It is with great pleasure tonight..</i>.
<i>that I introduce the architect
of our ancient Order's future</i>.
<i>Please welcome the CEO
of the Abstergo Foundation..</i>.
<i>Dr. Alan Rikkin</i>.
<i>With the recovery of the Apple..</i>.

All I have to do is shout.
I'm here to help you.
And you're here to help me.
I can't help you anymore.
What about all those great plans?
Cure violence.
Combat aggression.
That's not going to happen.
You started this, Sophie.
You don't get to walk away.
We both know what happens next.
Not everything deserves to live.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
<i>But it is not to ourselves,
but to the future..</i>.

<i>A future purged of the Assassin's Creed</i>.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen..</i>.

I did this.
I will retrieve the Artifact for the Elders.
Lynch, I want for me.
It is not to ourselves, but to the future,
that we must give glory.
