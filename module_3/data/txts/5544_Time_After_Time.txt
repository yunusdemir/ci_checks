<i>- Woman: More sad news</i>
<i>as the amount of violent

<i>A woman was found
strangled in a guest room</i>

Identified as Dr. Brooke Monroe...
Sister of Griffin Monroe,
who was killed in a fire in
her townhouse last night.
A dual investigation is
currently under way.
In a recent statement issued by police,
- they are now questioning...
- You okay?
...a number of the Monroe's
assistants and acquaintances,
- but at this point in time, no leads.
- Never better.
Meanwhile, investigators are
combing through the rubble
of the now-destroyed Monroe townhouse
to discover the source of the fire.

♪ In a city that never sleeps
They found Brooke's body.
She was strangled.
Why would John kill her?
She was his ally.
I ruined his plans, so he lashed out.
And he'll do it again.
[Tablet beeps]
A colleague of mine gave me access
to every public security
camera in the city.
This was taken 10 minutes ago.
Where did this take place?
Four blocks from the hotel
where Brooke Monroe's body was found.
He could still be there.
Well, what are we waiting for?
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I love this city.
I just got involved
with the wrong woman.
She lied to me, betrayed me.
I had to end it.
Yeah, I've had a few tears of my own.
Best to just walk away.
Which I did, I did...
Right into this wonderful
little establishment.
[Chuckles] So, now what?
Well, it's not like I have

Besides, I'm not really one

You could.
Goodbye, John.
So, is this it, is it?
No hug goodbye?
Is this really how
you're going to end it?
Well, it appears so.
It's my understanding that the U.S.
Government will take good care of you.
Huh.
And you'll just run back to 1893,
and that will be that?
That's the plan.
I have a better idea. Why
don't you just kill me?
Get it over and done with.
- No, I don't think so.
- Go on, do it.
Do you really want to go back to 1893,
and always know somewhere
in the back of your mind
that you left me still out there?
Well, you won't be out anywhere, John.
You'll be in a cold,
isolated little prison cell,

your remaining days.
And you know what?
I will sleep like a little lamb.
[Chuckles] You're a coward.
