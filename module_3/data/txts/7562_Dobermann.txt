Eternal and almighty God.
You make the deaf hear.
You make the mute speak.
You send your son to us.
To help us fight against Satan.
Enabling mankind.
To part from darkness,
and enter the light.
Bless this child.
Deliver him from sins
and shine because of you.
May the Holy Spirit be with him.
Young.
In the name of Father, Son.
And the Holy Spirit.
I baptize you.
Did you see.
His eyes are like your dog's.
Father's water.
It's too cold.
Don't disturb him.
Wait.
Wait.
I have something for him.
Handsome?
357 magnum.
I bought it from arms dealer.
Aim for the stomach then head
that way you won't miss.
I want to carve a skull.
What do you think.
Put it away, wrong place.
Isn't this a little soon.
Why? How can man not have a gun.
First religious rite
then rite of passage.
The rite of arms.
Jerry, don't.
Shit! Did you see that.
You like her.
I don't.
Do you or don't you.
I like her.
Isn't she pretty.
Want to get on the truck
with her?
Just for a few minutes.
Just the two of you.
Yes or no?
She gets excited
when she sees uniform.
She used to be deaf.
Whatever you say
does not matter.
That's disgusting.
You wet your pants.
Man, change your cloth.
It doesn't pay to wear uniform.
Out.
Not out.
It's out.
Out?
How could you tell,
it's a meter away.
Bulldog scores, now serves.
Bulldog scores, now serves.
That crow is so noisy.
What does he know about
being a referee.
Forget it, it's a foul.
I don't care.
15 love.
Give him a lesson.
If any pretends to know,
I'll show him.
I can't take these Nazis.
Then go buy some balls.
This fella is taking a vacation.
You think this is cool.
Did you not see them play tennis.
You think that they are cool.
They are nuts.
That head-liced idiot.
Took out his gun.
And blew the tennis ball away.
They are being watched.
He will meet up with them.
I've said it a hundred times
this feels like a dream.
But it wasn't a dream
I've seen it.
Who's the one holding the dog.
Don't know, got here last night.
What kind of dog is this.
Bulldog.
This isn't Bulldog.
I am Jacky, also known as Bulldog.
An American expert in fights and robbery.
With axe.
With axe?
They seem to be all there.
Seems like it.
He's Mosquito?
No, he's Bulldog.
That's Mosquito, he's very tense.
He's a priest?
I'll tell you one thing.
Watch out for Mosquito,
he's trigger happy.
Do you ladies give handjobs.
Not every one gets to torture
these fifteen-year old addicts.
My hands smell like meat.
He's the famous gangster.
He is the famous gangster.
They seem like serious addicts.
They are all alike.
Drug will hook you, break you.
It' s the trend.
It's the trend.
Once I start, they're dead meat.
Of course.
But you won't start.
Chris, you are out.
There are so many complaints
about you. It's like a mountain.
Go back to your home,
let us do our job.
Yes, sir.
He should make a call.
This is not his style.
Should we get
an answering machine.
In case he call
while we're playing.
That makes sense.
If he does not call
we don't have to wait.
Why are you repainting,
we leave in 3 days.
What happened to this house.
You want to know?
A decent young man.
Broke.
So he used a shotgun to end it.
His wife.
Three children.
And himself.
Shit.
The blood is making me sick.
It's all over my ceiling.
There may be children crying
at night.
Why doesn't he go for
the right people.
Without faith, man goes nuts.
Without faith?
Without money.
You're dead.
I know.
My sister.
Wait.
Let go, she's my sister.
Are we moving again?
I guess so.
No black coffee to wake up.
I don't drink coffee.
There should be beer in the frige.
They are so beautiful.
They are identical twins.
Great, just like that.
I'll help you put the knife back.
My lovely sister.
Pony, stop messing around.
You want to be castrated.
She's my sister.
Shut up.
Go prepare the car.
Shit, why don't you get
a garbage man.
Probably because of the legend.
I don't care about no legend.
Pony What?
Stop.
Don't sell it.
Come over here.
You miss me?
I miss you all the time.
You want your car?
Are you asking me.
Do you have weapons.
No, there's no time.
He's sick, this will leave marks.
Do you want to commit robbery?
This is a big deal.
I need thirty heads.
Get Nose, Torpedo
and Mathew Brothers.
All the men
Right.
There's a lot of them
Right.
When?
Tomorrow, go now.
Asshole, jerk.
Are you coming?
Not this weekend
Why?
I just can't.
You think I am a fool.
I didn't say that I don't think
that you are a fool.
I just have things to do
Excuses.
Do you get it?
This is your kid
I know.
I get him the next two weekends.
Next week and the one after.
Really.
It's a deal.
Call me tomorrow.
That woman's a drag.
That idiot came to
the wrong place.
Calm down.
Stop taking drug.
It makes you tense.
Let me.
Do I look suspicious.
Tense?
I' m not tense, are you tense?
No.
Priest, you came out
without a cover?
What's that? A hallo?
Nata.
Princess.
We are expecting you.
Thank you for all these gifts.
Right, thanks.
What did you rob?
It's an investment.
It is so convenient to cheat
with sign language.
Would you teach me.
You rob and let us wait.
Thank you for your invitation.
What?
How long has he been like this?
He's been bored for weeks.
He dreams of robbing banks.
He think that cops are illusions.
I'm thinking about
the fine differences.
He forgot what age he's in.
Talking about
decompression chamber.
Monitoring camera, he yawns.
How about Cordell?
No -man bank?
How will you rob these?
Fax?
Young, tell him to face reality.
We can't deal with him.
Not only are banks modernized.
Sunny gave me
laser-guided machine gun.
This is a small missile.
No door can stop this.
After breaking into the bank.
The shock wave will
pin everyone to the wall.
The shock wave of the rocket.
Pretty.
It's x'mas.
There is smell of
x'mas trees.
I'm Cordell.
Sir, there's news from the villa.
A man and a woman showed up
all left in a car.
I'll fill you in later.
Shit!
They are moving
they've all left the villa.
He....
He must be the Gangster.
Who's checking out who?
Casey, Dushey, Noby
they are on the car tracking.
Lucky, let's keep it that way.
Tell the mobile team to stand by.
Wait, aren't you rushing it a bit.
They may be out bowling.
Don't rush it.
Taking three cars to
the bowling alley?
They must be robbing a bank.
We should move out.
You got your license
while in kindergarten.
What?
Come here.
If I go down, take care of Nata.
She wouldn't pay attention to me.
Don't let her be foolish.
What?
Blondie.
What.
I mean you look good in a wig.
If you laugh, I will kill you.
I'm putting it away and changing.
Go home this afternoon.
It's only a birthday, don't worry.
I'm not worrying.
Call me, I'll come meet you.
What do your parents think you do.
Studying law,
they want me to be a lawyer.
Goddamn fagot.
I want to go with you.
We're robbing a bank.
Goddamn duty officer.
Why do you put on this kind of
make up.
All those girls who are arrested
are always sloppy on papers.
So what?
She did it on purpose.
To set an example.
They could say that you are gay.
Be careful.
Are you nuts?
Are you coming baby?
This is such a mess.
Let's go.
The woman is really deaf.
Mosquito, aren't you wearing
a mask?
I like to show myself on
the paper.
Who else is on this one?
Leo, Pony, Nose, Torpedo.
And Matthew Brothers.
They're all here.
You got a bunch of clowns.
Nobody is laughing.
See you tonight.
Sunny, see you tonight.
Don't forget,
today is my birthday.
East station.
I don't what it is.
What is this crap.
Fox 3 calling Z1, over.
This is Z1, come in Fox 3.
A Mercedes with 5 passengers.
Leaving exit no 3.
Heading towards the Louvre.
Fox 4 calling Z1, over.
Fox 4, come in.
Funny, the traced car
just came out.
Driver is a female.
Keep tracing.
Sebastian Street, armed robbery.
Republic Plaza, armed robbery.
In front of
the MET entrance.
Montpanas,
Beret Street Business Center.
Your plan worked.
There are never enough cops
to go around.
Claude, this is a trap.
Mind your business.
Go straight to Defont Street.
We got to go now.
Don't think that Chris is right?
All the police are dealing with
robberies they are phantoms.
There is not one cop
we redeploy.
There is bound to
be one real phantom
I don't want to miss that.
Are you coming.
I set the time and place
for this kind of massacre.
Let's go.
Such pretty little prank.
They must be dreaming
if they think that
they catch them all.
Fox 4 calling Z1.
Fox 4 calling Z1.
Fox 4, come in.
The woman driving sports car
just parked
in from of Olympia Hotel.
Waiting for instructions.
Fox 4 waiting for instructions.
Isn't this a good opportunity
to show off?
You take care of the woman driver.
I will tell the commissioner
good news.
The end of the Gangster.
Fox 4
move out...
Claude's men are useless
we are back in war.
Unless they can kill the gangster.
What kind of chance do they have?
Must you drive so fast?
You don't know
where you are going.
Shit! She loves explosions.
This is Fox 1.
Come in, over.
Sebastian St. bank
has been robbed.
Fox 1, get ready.
Hurry....
My eardrum is about to break.
Madam....
Marx, did you see that?
Bank, bang....
You call him Marx?
I loved his movie
when I was young.
Bought all the tapes.
They are hard to find nowadays.
Z1, report your current position.
Don't stop, move.
Don't be rash,
there is too many men.
We've sealed off
all escape routes.
They can't get away.
Can't get away?
This is full of holes, a trap.
They are leaving again.
Dave, keep up.
What are you doing, faster....
They are slowing down.
They are not robbing another bank?
They are stopping at....
The front of the Union Bank.
Don't move.
What are they doing.
Sir.
Sir.
I'm too old, can't get down.
It's all right, you may stand.
What?
Just stand
it's me.
I'm busy.
I'm busy
why don't you pay your rent.
I came to get 500f.
You have forgotten your rent.
No I did not.
I have a bounced check.
I don't want to bounce checks
you owe me 30,000f.
Are you deaf?
Who do you think you are?
The queen of France?
Take it, we are not thirves.
Go to hell.
At last.
Let's go.
Calm down.
Wait.
This is a trick.
What trick?
Two people are staying
in the bank.
They will come out to
drive another car.
They won't come out.
Shit....
They tricked us.
Z1 calling all foxes.
Clear all the exists.
Don't act without my command.
Repeat, follow my orders.
I don't need a hostage situation.
If the people in the car signals
the robbers inside will come out.
Then we move in, got it.
Got it?
Yes.
It will fuck up.
No, there is only
two of them.
There are six of us,
we are in the dark.
Let's go.
Shit.
It's me.
This is your first time
do not take the gate.
Asshole.
Don't move.
Don't worry, no problem.
Take that! Cop.
Don't....
What?
His head ruined my gun.
I don't like masks.
Young, cops.
We are still in the bank.
We'll be right there.
Go back! Cops.
Leo, the one on motorcycle.
The one on motorcycle.
Shit.
Shoot.
Shoot.
Where is he?
The invisible rider.
The messenger from hell.
Shoot him.
Hurry.
Goddamn cops.
Helmet.
Faster, priest.
Grenade.
No.
His light will shine on you
he is holding on.
He will make you stronger.
You call out god for
He shall take you.
You call.
He'll say.
I'm coming.
What is this? Blood?
It's the rider's.
It's stuck.
Doesn't matter.
It's not the rider's,there's hair.
It's Marx's.
What are you doing?
Give me his gun
I want this to look like suicide.
Good idea.
What is this bitch babbling about.
I'm Young.
I thought it was my wife again.
There's cops everywhere.
Hold on, we'll be right there.
We'll be there.
It's Young, he came for us.
Great
there's a lot of cops out there.
I'll take care of them
Wait.
Use that guy as a shield.
Com out, we're here
let's go out.
You idiots.
Put down your weapons.
Good....
Slowly....
Great.
Come on cops....
Give me the gun
Relax.
Thank you.
I am collecting guns.
Taxi is here.
Let's go.
Roy.
I said this would screw up.
We just made it.
We've just lost it.
Great.
Marx.
Where is Marx?
Sorry.
I opened the door, he ran out.
What, let's go look for him.
Cops will be here any minute.
I don't care, I want my dog.
Wait! Bulldog.
Let me go or die here.
Here is Marx.
A rider is shooting at us.
God has punished him.
He is beheaded and gone to heaven.
What?
He means we blew his head off.
I want to give him the best grave.
The best grave for any dog.
Then I will skin these cops alive.
Sure.
Of course.
Shit.
There's twice the bread.
And cheap drinks.
Want hot sauce.
No hot sauce, mustard.
The woman left the hotel.
She is dressed like a man.
A lesbian in man's cloth?
Yes, sir.
It's someone we know.
You remember Olivier.
The prostitute named Sunny?
That is him.
Look what I've found in the car.
The bitch and
the Gangster are together.
Fine, where is she now?
Her parents' house,
around the corner.
Great....
Let's go find her.
Aren't you eating?
They are Fox 4.
Tell them to get lost.
Go, let's go.
Commissioner has assigned you?
Really?
Damn.
Move.
Idiot, move.
Goddamn it.
Shut up.
Do you understand?
She's bleeding.
Police.
Call the police.
This is great.
I love it.
It's delicious, but too much.
You're too thin, eat more.
You didn't mention anything
about school.
There is nothing to say.
When can you start working?
It's not easy being a lawyer.
You have a wife and family.
We can't always take care of you.
Now we can.
Let him study.
You eat, I'll open the door.
Are you expecting someone?
Who is it?
Police.
Police.
Sit down.
Hi, Sunny.
Can I cal you Sunny.
In front of your family?
I'll call you Olivier.
You know them?
We can talk elsewhere.
Why?
Isn't it better in front of
the family?
Why do they call you Sunny?
Why don't you speak?
What are you doing with
the Gangster?
Robbing banks for fun?
We can not disrespect money
like so.
We must respect money....
Gangster deserves to die
buried six feet under.
I don't know what
you are talking about.
I am talking about the Gangster.
Calm down.
This is a waste of time, right?
You're doing all right, Sunny.
Must be, driving a fast car.
It that car yours?
You must give a thousand blowjobs.
To be able to buy this car.
Something normal people
are incapable of.
We found this in the car.
This is what we are
more familiar with.
You don't mind your son
doing plastic surgery
on his testicles.
Your son giving blowjobs all day.
Don't you mind?
What?
Asshole.
Your mother is not (polite.
Tell them they are wrong.
Say it.
Right.
Say we have the wrong place.
Say it....
Say it.
They are here for me.
I am not a law student,
I'm a prostitute.
Shut up.
I won't.
You want me to become a lawyer
I have made it half way.
Mom, you don't have to
feed me medicine anymore.
I always fart because of anal sex.
Great, Sunny.
You rather ruin the family.
But the show must go on.
You even have a child.
You have both sexes.
To fuck and be fucked.
Where is the Gangster.
The child would say his father
is gay.
I love kids.
I mean it.
I want to have my own.
We'll get along fine.
We can play for hours.
But there is no time now.
July.
Don't move.
Put the child back.
Look how you are forcing me.
Just to protect one asshole.
Where is Gangster.
I'll the child
if you don't tell me.
I'll hit your wife.
What are you thinking?
Are you still dreaming.
Such a pity,
especially on his birthday.
Really.
Today is his birthday?
That makes a difference.
I hate ruin birthdays.
Even if the birthday boy
is an asshole.
Everybody should get a present.
Take it, baby.
No.
No.
No.
You should see how I blow off
his head.
The cop is gone.
>From the rear window.
It looks like a movie.
Pity, no slow motion replay.
But cops all have hard heads.
We tried to kill him, but failed.
Can you pray for my dog?
Kill him.
All the teeth?
Sure.
I'm leaving.
So soon?
Goodbye everyone.
Mosquito.
Mosquito.
Want me to stay with you
No.
You have a date with Sunny?
I want to get my money first.
Make a phone call
before going.
Why?
Don't you think
that the cops are moving fast.
There is cops everywhere
isn't that a part of your plan?
We will bump into some too.
You are happy about
killing two cops?
I can't just sit there waiting
to die.
I'll call him first.
O.K..
God.
Ride father's horse.
I'm Mosquito.
It's you.
No, it's the Pope.
How is my car?
Just fine.
You sound strange.
The elevator is down,
I'm out of breath.
No problem?
No problem.
Your parents still there?
They are washing dishes.
Such a warm family.
Why do you say that?
Nothing, it's a family thing.
Good.
Bye.
See you tonight.
So?
They are going to Joey's tonight.
Beside the canal
the club with a skull.
You are going too.
Looking lovely, with a smile.
I can't....
Yes you can.
My man is a good cop.
But have no patient with children.
Don't worry,
it'll be great tonight.
You will be breathtaking.
The queen of the club.
Here's the champagne.
The delivery man
will be here afternoon.
What?
The delivery man
will be here afternoon.
What?
Just one problem.
Speak.
We have to kill the duty officer.
Is that a problem?
You think this is a problem?
No, I can help you kill
the duty officer.
There are two of them.
Then I will kill two people.
I love this Victoria.
Robbing banks, great.
Killing cops, great.
Blow me.
No problem.
Nature is so corrupt.
What did he say?
What did you say?
Nature is so corrupt
and loves no one.
What is corrupt.
Nature.
It's only lions eating zebras.
You don't know what is a zebra.
I know it when I see it.
There is a big zebra here.
The biggest in the world,
still eaten.
What is this shit?
Why don't you get a real woman?
What is the difference?
Sunny said, she fucked all of you.
What is he saying?
Calm down.
You've got a woman,
stop complaining.
I've never fucked a man.
I don't know whose mouth it is.
How much longer do we have
to wait?
He's not coming.
He'll come.
I don't believe it, he's nuts.
He's not crazy.
Before I reached the age of one.
He gave me my first gun.
So what?
That's Uncle Joey.
Let's go.
What?
There are cops everywhere.
Stop being paranoid.
You always think there are cops
everywhere.
Not tonight
I feel something horrible.
Let's move.
What are waiting for?
Don't touch me like this.
You're blind
I'm not blind, I'm only deaf.
I know....
Kill the woman first.
What?
Head quarter calling Luna 1.
This is Luna 1, over.
Commissioner say it's urgent
he must speak with you.
You cut the radio?
After I get rid of the Gangster
the commissioner will thank me.
Asshole.
Suspended.
What is this?
If it is cops,
the alarm will show.
Put the gun away.
Why hide the gun if it is a cop.
Come on....
How are you?
I'm going to New York next week.
When you see me again.
I'll have a virgina.
And a huge clitoris.
He's coming.
I can't believe we've found him.
Silence, the child will be tense.
Tell commissioner to
send all units.
Why not ask for the air force?
I don't know
what you are thinking.
But I know what these devils
are plotting.
I am still going to
call the commissioner.
Shut up.
You're such a pest.
You could have gotten the Gangster.
Two men are dead
because you're afraid.
Shut up or go back.
They are like fine game.
Taste better when rotting a bit.
One more.
One more.
Smoke some pot.
Shoot up.
Let them enjoy.
Let them get stoned.
We'll wait by the door.
And catch them one by one.
Like ripe fruits falling
from the trees.
You hid drugs in your gun?
Cops would never look here.
Good idea.
Take that.
This may kill you.
You did not remove the detonator.
Why remove it?
Yeah, why remove it?
What do you think about me.
With you, I fee like a woman.
You are handsome.
Don't look at me like this.
What? What's the matter with you.
Don't you feel well?
Come.
It smells.
Who farted in the car.
The kid just took a dump.
Go change him, it stinks.
What?
Someone was showing a gun
in front of me.
I came to dance not to see guns.
It's Pony
That's right.
Other would complain too.
Get back on stage, I'll handle it.
I'll be right back.
Right?
Sunny, happy birthday.
This is fun.
Young.
Thanks.
What's wrong with you.
I have to take a shit.
Someone is in the toilet.
I can't wait.
When I can not hold it.
I must take a shit.
Then go outside, shit outside.
Fuck you and outside.
Yeah, now is the time.
I'll show you my shit.
A group of lunatics.
What can you do with these morons.
They are the best.
What are you doing.
I am going to shit in the canal.
He is not going to piss over us.
Who is he?
Don't know, he's desperate.
He's not pissing.
What is he doing?
All right....
Shit, kid.
Police, stop.
I thought you tide him up.
Damn.
Baby, it's all right.
Asshole.
Shit.
No.
You go down.
You go up.
Take him back to the car.
Young, hurry.
My baby has been shot.
Police, get down.
I can't see.
Damn, the money.
Shit.
Go forward.
We'll show them.
I'll call the commissioner.
Welcome back to reality.
That way.
Careful.
Almost there.
Where's the Gangster.
Didn't find him.
Why did the music stop?
Why did the music stop?
Get up, moron.
You idiot.
That way, we'll be safe.
That's the old escape route.
It leads to the parking lot.
When it's quiet, we can leave.
There is enough beer to
last two weeks.
I have to go look for my bird.
Is that a security device?
No....
If it's a video camera
they will be right on our tails.
Invisible, the wall is full
of security device.
Sound proof, very private.
You know any good place?
Fuck it.
Don't break it,
I don't have any more.
Can you pray
I don't know.
Pray What are you doing?
Don't shoot, I have a hostage.
Please, don't shoot.
We are coming out.
He's crazy.
Put down your weapon, or he dies.
They are together.
May the Lord be with us.
The all mighty Lord.
Stop praying, get in the car.
Get in.
Sir, Officer Bowman.
What about Bowman.
He's head has been blown off.
Great....
Sunny, you're beautiful.
Kiss me.
Can I retrieve the transmitter now.
Get this snitch out of here.
No, it's not like this.
I will put a swastika
on your grave.
We'll discuss decoration later.
Take them up first.
Make them talk.
Everyone is busted,
how come you got away.
You know the rules.
Tell Young,
this is because of the kid.
Let's go.
No.
Wait.
You have to go out.
No, I can't die.
Forget about my little brother.
Pay no attention to what I say.
Can't get arrested for a poke.
You have blood in your urine.
Stop talking about urine.
Don't make me cuss, it hurts.
Good....
Remember our first robbery?
The post office on Duke St..
And?
We ran out
And then?
A police car came,
I was going to surrender.
You've already pulled out your gun.
What did I do?
You shot those bastards.
That's right.
Those sons of batches.
You told me.
What did I tell you?
What did I say?
You said,
don't let the bastards get you.
You are better
and have better weapon.
You are not going to hand me over.
Pony....
He's not going to make it.
It's Nata and Bulldog.
Jacky, a.k.a. Bulldog.
Young, a.k.a. the Gangster.
They are all villains.
Mosquito, Jean Claude.
Priest, Ally.
You have not heard of them.
Tell me which team
I may remember.
What kind of sports do they play.
Here is a picture
of you and the Gangster.
You want my autograph?
Isn't this your mark?
You all have it.
I like dogs.
The drug charge alone
will get you 15 years.
More than that.
Much more.
The dead officer, head of family.
I came for a friend's
birthday party.
Her name is Sunny, ask her.
She? You don't know her?
She has the same tattoo as you.
You don't know her?
You must know the Gangster
he is your boyfriend.
Poor fool.
He got away,
you got prison for life.
You are still young,
it's a long road.
A very long life ahead of you.
With no one to depend on
you think he will wait 20 years?
What do you mean?
I get it.
What do you get.
Go to hell.
Asshole.
You have no one to lean on.
Your nazi brothers all ran away.
Only the two of you left.
Asshole.
Sorry, Dave.
Include cleaning bill on expenses.
This man is sick, must be put away.
That.
Shit, Pony.
No....
Wait.
Young, there are cops outside.
You take care of Pony
at least until tomorrow.
Don't let them get him.
I told you to stop.
Get lost.
Stop, you are crazy.
Get lost.
Go away.
Shit.
Chris.
Chris.
What kind of joke are you playing?
Shit! Watch out.
Chris.
Fuck.
I'm going to fuck Gangster's chick.
Watch.
You lose.
You lose.
You lose, did you hear?
You want to mess with me?
Fuck you.
Let's see.
Who's the boss.
I'll fucking kill you.
You son of a bitch, I got you.
Come on.
Fuck you.
Fuck you, you hear?
We chop off cops' heads for free.
For Leo.
For Bulldog.
For Pony.
Alive.
I'm alive.
God.
Our lives are short and fragile.
Death reminds us of this.
But you are everlasting.
Your love is greater than Death.
We hand our brothers.
And our sisters to You.
Forgive her sins.
So that You can protect her.
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.
Amen.
This kind burial is suspicious.
You want the real thing?
