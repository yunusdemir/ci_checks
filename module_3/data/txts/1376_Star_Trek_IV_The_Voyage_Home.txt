What do you make of it?
It appears to be a probe from an intelligence unknown to us.
Transmit "peace" and "hello" in all known languages.
Get me Starfleet Command. Ready, Captain.
This is U.S.S. Saratoga patrolling sector five, neutral zone.
We're tracking a probe headed for the Terran solar system.
Attempts to communicate have been negative.
Continue tracking,
we will advise.
Roger, Starfleet.
Six, five, four, three, two, one...
Hold the image. Hold!
Behold the quintessential devil in these matters:
James T. Kirk.
He murdered a Klingon crew and stole their vessel.
But here is the real plot.
While we negotiated peace,
Kirk was developing the Genesis torpedo.
It was conceived by Kirk's son, and tested by the Admiral himself.
This energy created what is called, euphemistically, the Genesis Planet.
A base from which to launch the annihilation of the Klingon people.
We demand the extradition of Kirk. We demand justice.
Klingon justice is a unique point of view.
Genesis was perfectly named. The creation of life, not death.
The Klingons shed the first blood, attempting to possess its secrets.
Vulcans are the intellectual puppets of this Federation.
Klingons destroyed U.S.S. Grissom. Your men killed Kirk's son.
Do you deny these events? We deny nothing.
We must preserve our race. By committing murder?
Silence!
There will be no further outbursts from the floor.
I have come to speak on behalf of the accused.
Personal bias. His son was saved by Kirk.
Mr. Ambassador,
the Council's deliberations are over.
Kirk goes unpunished?
Admiral Kirk has been charged with violating Starfleet regulations.
Starfleet regulations? That's outrageous!
Remember this well: There shall be no peace as long as Kirk lives.
Captain's log, stardate 8390.
Three months of Vulcan exile.
Dr. McCoy decided upon a name
for our captured Klingon vessel.
Like the mutineers of 500 years ago, we, too, have a hard choice to make.
Dr. McCoy? Aye, sir.
Mr. Scott? Aye, sir.
Uhura? Aye, sir.
Chekov? Aye, sir.
Sulu? Aye, sir.
The commander and the crew of the late Starship Enterprise
have voted to return to Earth,
to face the consequences of their actions in the rescue of Capt. Spock.
Thank you all. Repair stations, please.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we be underway?
One more day. Damage control is easy.
Reading Klingon is hard.
It's bad enough to be court-martialed,
but to have to go home in this Klingon flea trap...
This flea trap has a cloaking device that cost us a lot.
I just wish we could cloak the stench.
Computer, resume testing.
Who said, "Logic is the cement of our civilization with
which we ascend from chaos"?
T'plana-Hath, matron of Vulcan philosophy.
What is the molecular formula of aluminum sulphite crystal?
Queen takes knight, rook takes queen, pawn takes rook. Checkmate.
Correct.What contribution to bioengineering was made on Klendth?
The universal atmospheric compensator.
Starship sensors indicate
it is being pursued so closely, it occupies the pursuer's space.
Identify object. Klingon mummification glyph.
What historic event took place on Earth in 1987?
What is Kiri-Kin-Tha's first law? Nothing unreal exists.
Adjust this sine wave so that antineutrons can pass through it.
What is Gadolinium?
How do you feel?
I do not understand the question. What is it, Spock?
I do not understand, Mother. You're half human.
The computer knows that. The question is irrelevant.
The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way.
You may not understand feelings...
but as my son,
you have them.
As you wish, since you deem them of value.
But I cannot wait here to find them... Why?
Where must you go?
I must go to Earth, to offer testimony.
You do this for friendship. I do it because I was there.
Spock... Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
I would accept that as an axiom.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake
made by your flawed, feeling,
human friends.
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed
that the good of the one, you, was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions. They do indeed.
Here it comes now.
What's causing that?
A powerful amplification wave.
Can we isolate the wave?
No, it's impacting on our systems.
Yellow alert. Shields up. Reduce closing speed.
Thrusters have been neutralized. Emergency thrusters.
No response.
Emergency lights.
Damage report? Systems down. Reserve power only.
Starfleet Command, this is Saratoga. Can you hear me?
Come in, please.
Thank you, sir.
Status report, Admiral. Not good, Mr. President.
The probe is heading for us, damaging everything in its path.
The Klingons have lost two vessels.
Two starships and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Neutralized? How? We don't know.
Get me the Yorktown.
Emergency channel 0130. Code red.
Since contact with the alien probe,
all attempts to regain power have failed.
It's using forms of energy
we do not understand.
Can you protect us? We're launching everything.
We are trying to deploy a makeshift solar sail
to generate enough power to keep us alive.
Systems report. Communications systems all ready.
Communications officer, as ready as she'll ever be.
Guidance has a functional interface
with the Federation memory bank.
Weapons systems and cloaking device are operational.
I'm impressed.
We're in an enemy vessel.
I did not wish to be shot down.
Engine room, report.
We're ready. The dilithium sequencer is now a little less primitive.
And I've replaced the Klingon food packs.
They were giving me a sour stomach. Is that what it was?
Prepare for departure. Everybody not going to Earth had better get off.
Saavik... this is goodbye. Yes, Admiral.
Thank you.
Sir, I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.
David died most bravely. He saved Spock.
He saved us all. I thought you should know.
Good day, Capt. Spock. May your journey be free of incident.
Live long and prosper, Lieutenant.
Permission to come aboard, Admiral.
Jim, Spock. Don't you remember?
It would not be proper to refer to you as Jim while you're in command.
Also, I must apologize for my attire. I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Station.
Is this a good idea? What?
Him, back at his post like nothing happened.
He's not exactly working on all thrusters.
It'll come back to him. Are you sure?
That's what I thought.
Mr. Sulu, take us home.
Thrusters functional.
One quarter impulse power.
Space dock, this is Starfleet.
Launch all vessels.
Space dock doors are inoperative. All systems are non-functional.
Engage reserve power.
Starfleet, this is space dock. We have lost all internal power.
Estimating planet Earth, 1.6 hours at present speed.
Continue on course. Any sign of Federation escort?
No, sir, and no Federation vessels on patrol.
That's odd. Uhura, what's on the com channels?
Very active. Multi-phasic transmissions. Almost a gibberish.
Let me see if I can sort it out.
Hi. Busy?
Uhura is busy. I am monitoring.
It sure is nice to have your Katra back in your head,
and not mine.
I may have carried your soul,
but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
My shoes?
Forget it.
Perhaps we could cover a little philosophical ground.
Life, death, life. Things of that nature.
I've not yet reviewed the philosophical disciplines.
Come on. You really have gone
where no man has gone before.
Tell me what it felt like.
We have no frame of reference.
You're joking. A joke is a humorous story.
I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
I'm receiving a number of distress calls.
I don't doubt it.
Juneau, Alaska. Clouds increasing to 95%.
Tokyo, total cloud coverage.
Leningrad has lost all electrical power.
Cloud coverage 100%. Temperature decreasing rapidly.
What is Earth's total cloud coverage? 78.6%.
Starfleet emergency. Red alert.
Switch to planetary power reserves.
Even with all planetary reserves
we cannot survive without the sun.
I'm well aware of that.
Ambassador Sarek, I'm afraid you're trapped here with us.
There's no way we can answer this probe.
It's difficult to answer when one does not understand the question.
Perhaps you should transmit a planetary distress signal...
...while we still have time.
Admiral? What is it?
Overlapping distress calls and a message from the Federation.
On screen.
This is the President of the United Federation of Planets.
Do not approach Earth.
The transmissions of an orbiting probe are critically damaging this planet.
It is ionizing our atmosphere. All power sources have failed.
Earth-orbiting starships are powerless. The probe is vaporizing our oceans.
We cannot survive unless a way can be found to respond to the probe.
Further communications may not be possible.
Save your energy. Save yourselves.
Avoid the planet Earth at all costs. Farewell.
Let's hear the probe's transmission.
Yes, sir. On speakers.
What do you make of that? Most unusual.
An unknown form of energy of great power and intelligence,
unaware that its transmissions are disruptive.
I find it illogical that its intentions be hostile.
You think this is its way of saying, "Hi, there!" to Earth?
Only human arrogance would assume
the message must be meant for man.
You're suggesting the transmission is meant
for a life form other than man?
It is a possibility. The President did say it was directed at Earth's oceans.
The president did say it was directed at Earth's oceans.
Can you modify the signals accounting for density,
temperature and salinity.
I can try, sir.
I think I have it.
This is what it would sound like underwater?
Yes, sir.
Fascinating.
If my suspicion is correct, there can be no response to this message.
Where are you going? To test my theory.
Bones, you stay here. No way, I want to keep an eye on him.
As suspected, the transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Whales? Specifically, humpback whales.
That's crazy.
Who would send a probe to talk to a whale?
Whales were on Earth far earlier than man.
10 million years earlier. Humpbacks were heavily hunted.
They died out in the 21st century.
The alien probe could be here to determine
why they lost contact.
Could the humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
Can the species be found elsewhere?
Humpbacks were indigenous
to Earth.
Then we have no choice.
We must destroy the probe.
To attempt to do so would be futile.
We can't just turn away. There must be an alternative.
There is one possibility.
We could attempt to find some whales.
You just said there aren't any, except on Earth of the past.
That is exactly what I said.
Well, in that case... Wait just a damn minute.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.
Bones, come with me.
We need that power to keep medical facilities functioning.
All underground storage systems have been shut down.
How long is this bay? About 60 feet.
Can you enclose it to hold water? Are you planning to take a swim?
Off the deep end. We've got to find some humpbacks.
Humpbacked people? Whales.
45-50 feet long, about 40 tons each.
You're going to try time travel in this rust bucket?
You'd have to slingshot around the sun to
pick up enough speed.
Would you prefer to do nothing? I prefer common sense.
We go back in time, find some whales,
then bring them forward in time,
and hope to hell they tell this probe to clear off?
That's crazy! You have a better idea?
Computation is in progress. Uhura, get me Starfleet Command.
I'm picking up a faint transmission from Admiral Kirk.
On screen.
Starfleet Command, this is Admiral James T. Kirk.
We have intercepted and analyzed the call of the probe.
Go to reserve power.
It is our opinion that only the extinct humpback whale
can give a proper response to the probe.
Stabilize.
Emergency reserve.
We are going to attempt time travel.
We are computing our trajectory at this time.
Get him back!
Ready to engage computer.
What's our target in time? Late 20th century.
Can you be more specific?
I've had to programme
some of the variables from memory.
What are the variables? Availability of fuel. Mass of the vessel.
Probable location of whales. In this case, the Pacific Basin.
You programmed that from memory? I have.
"Angels and ministers defend us." "Hamlet", act 1, scene IV.
No doubt about your memory. Prepare for warp speed.
Shields, Mr. Chekov. Shields.
May fortune favor the foolish.
Warp speed, Mr. Sulu.
Warp 2.
Warp 3. Steady as she goes.
Warp 4.
Warp 5.
Warp 6.
Warp 7.
Warp 8. Heat shields at maximum.
Warp 9!
9.2, 9.3... We need breakaway speed.
9.5 9.6 9.7...
9.8...
Now!
I should never have left him.
Jim, where are we?
You're talking about the end of everybody on Earth.
Mr. Sulu...
Mr. Sulu.
Aye, sir. What is our condition?
The breaking thrusters have fired. Picture, please.
Earth... But when? Spock?
Judging by atmospheric pollution, the latter half of the 20th century.
Well done, Spock.
We may be visible to them.
Quite right. Engage cloaking device.
Crossing the terminator into night. The west coast of North America.
I am receiving whale song. Put them on speakers.
This is strange.
The song is coming directly from San Francisco.
From the city? That doesn't make sense.
We have a serious problem.
It's these Klingon crystals. The time travel drained them.
They're decrystalizing. Give me a round figure.
24 hours, staying cloaked.
After that we're visible and dead in the water.
We haven't the power to break out of Earth's gravity or get home.
We can't stop now.
Can't we recrystalize the dilithium?
We can't even do that in the 23rd century.
Admiral, there may be a 20th century possibility.
I recall there was a dubious flirtation with nuclear fission reactors.
They resulted in toxic side-effects
and were replaced in the fusion era.
But at this time, we may be able to find some.
But you said they were toxic.
We collect only high-energy photons.
These photons would recrystalize the dilithium structure... theoretically.
Where would we find these reactors?
They were used in naval vessels.
San Francisco. I was born there.
It doesn't look all that different.
Set us down in Golden Gate Park. Aye, sir. Descending.
Uhura and Chekov are assigned the uranium problem.
Dr. McCoy, Mr. Scott and Mr. Sulu
will convert us a whale tank.
Oh, joy!
while Spock and I attempt to trace these whale songs to their source.
I'll have bearing and distance, sir.
Be very careful, this is terra incognita.
Many of their customs will take us by surprise.
None of these people have ever seen an extraterrestrial.
This is a primitive and paranoid culture.
Take a phaser and a communicator.
Radio silence except in emergencies.
Remove your rank insignia.
Any questions? All right.
Let's do our job and get out of here.
Our own world is waiting for us.
Commence landing procedure. Aye, sir.
Were you two fighting again? I thought you made up.
Why are you two always fighting? I like the way she fights.
I told her I wasn't spending $60
on a damn toaster oven.
What did she say to that? Well...
What the hell was that?
Did you see that? No, and neither did you.
Bearing to the whales? 283 degrees, 15.2 kilometers.
Everybody remember where we parked.
Watch where you're going, dumb-ass!
Double dumb-ass on you!
It's a miracle our race survived.
They're still using money.
Spock. The rest of you stay here.
Break up, you look like a cadet review.
18th century American. Quite valuable.
You do want to part with them? How much will you give me?
Those were a gift from Dr. McCoy.
And they will be again.
How much? The lenses aren't intact.
I'll give you $100. Is that a lot?
That's all there is. Don't splurge.
All set? Good hunting.
Thanks to your restored memory,
and a little bit of good luck,
we're walking around San Francisco looking for humpback whales.
How will you solve this problem? Simple logic will suffice.
I will make use of this map.
I have the distance and bearing from Uhura.
If we juxtapose our coordinates,
we should be able to find our destination 283.7 degrees...
We'll find what we're looking for
at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito.
two humpback whales, George and Gracie.
How do you know this? Simple logic.
What does "exact change" mean?
How do we convert this tank?
If I had transparent aluminum... You're years too early for that.
Let's find their equivalent. But where?
Did you find it? Yes, now we need directions.
Now we need directions.
Excuse me, can you direct me to the naval base in Alameda?
It's where they keep the nuclear vessels.
Nuclear vessels.
Excuse us... We are looking for nuclear vessels.
Can you tell me where the naval base is in Alameda?
Hello, we are looking for the nuclear vessels in Alameda.
Can you help us? Where is the Alameda naval base?
Where are the nuclear vessels? Across the bay in Alameda.
That's what I said, Alameda.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, would you mind stopping that noise?
Excuse me, would you mind stopping that damn noise?
Admiral, may I ask you a question? Don't call me Admiral.
You used to call me Jim. What's your question?
Your use of language has altered since our arrival.
It is currently laced with more colorful metaphors.
"Double dumb-ass on you." The profanity?
That's the way they talk.
Nobody pays any attention unless you swear.
Look at the literature of the period. For example?
The works of Jacqueline Susann. The novels of Harold Robbins.
"The Giants".
The next showing of "The World of Whales" begins in five minutes.
Here I go.
Good morning,
I'm your guide this morning.
I'm Dr. Gillian Taylor.
I'm assistant director of
the Maritime Cetacean Institute.
The Cetacean Institute is the only museum devoted to whales.
We have a great deal to offer,
but that is small compared to what we don't know about whales.
One commonly held misconception is that whales are fish.
They're not. They're mammals like you and me.
Warm blooded, breathing air and producing milk to nurse their young.
Do whales attack people? No.
Most whales don't have teeth, they have a gum-like tissue
that strains tiny shrimp for food, and that is the limit of their hostility.
Unfortunately, their principal enemy is far more aggressive.
You mean man? To put it mildly.
Men have always harvested whales for a variety of purposes,
most of which can be synthesized.
100 years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, man did plenty of damage.
But that is nothing compared to what he has achieved in this century.
Mankind has hunted whales to the brink of extinction.
Virtually gone is the blue whale, the largest creature on Earth.
Despite all attempts to ban whaling, there are still countries and pirates
currently engaged in the slaughter of these creatures.
Humpback whales, once numerous, now number about 10,000 specimens.
Those that are taken are no longer fully grown.
In addition, many of the female whales are killed with their unborn calves.
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Whoever said the human race was logical?
If you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the institute's pride and joy.
This is the largest seawater tank in the world.
It contains the only two humpback whales in captivity.
They are mature humpbacks weighing 45,000 pounds each.
They wandered into San Francisco Bay as calves and were brought here.
We call them George and Gracie.
It's perfect. A male and female in a tank.
We can beam them up together.
Beautiful, aren't they? And extremely intelligent.
If you'll follow me, please.
Despite all they're teaching us,
we have to return them to the open sea.
We simply don't have enough money
to feed them two tons of shrimp a day.
How soon? Soon.
It's too bad, because they're really quite friendly.
I've grown quite attached to them.
Now here's a much better way to see George and Gracie. Underwater.
What you're hearing is recorded whale song, sung by the male.
He'll sing anywhere from 6 to 30 minutes.
In the ocean, other whales will pick up the song and pass it on.
The songs change every year. We don't know their purpose.
Are they a navigational signal?
Are they part of the mating ritual?
Or is it pure communication beyond our comprehension?
Frankly, we just don't know.
Maybe he's singing to that man.
What the hell?! Excuse me, wait right here.
Excuse me, please.
What were you doing in there? Yes, speak up.
Attempting the hell to communicate.
You have no right to be here!
You heard the lady.
If we assumed that these whales are ours to do with
as we please,
we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
I don't know what's going on,
but get out now, or I call the cops.
That's not necessary. We're trying to help.
Your friend was messing up my whales.
They like you, but they are not the hell your whales.
I suppose they told you that. The hell they did.
Right.
Spock Yes? About those colorful metaphors that we discussed.
You haven't quite got the knack of it.
Why not? You haven't quite got the knack of it.
I see. it's not always necessary to tell the truth.
I cannot tell a lie. I don't mean lie.
But you could exaggerate. You've done it before.
Can't you remember? The hell I can't.
What else did you learn? Their species is unhappy with man.
Are they going to help us? I communicated our intentions.
It's all right. I know. They didn't mean any harm.
I heard there was some excitement. Just a couple of kooks.
How are you doing? I'm fine.
Don't tell me fish stories, I've known you too long.
Bob, it's tearing me apart.
I feel the same, but we're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
If we keep them here or let them go,
we're still risking their lives.
I know.
They're not human beings. Their intelligence is...
My compassion is not limited to
my estimation of one's intelligence.
Team leader, this is team two. I have the co-ordinates of the reactor.
Kirk here. We have found the nuclear vessel.
Well done. Admiral, it is the Enterprise.
Understood. What's your plan?
We will beam in tonight and collect the photons. No one will know.
Understood and approved.
Kirk out.
There she is. If we play our cards right,
we can find out about the whales.
How will playing cards help? It's Robin Hood and Friar Tuck.
Where are you fellas heading? Back to San Francisco.
You came all this way just for a swim?
I won't try to explain. I'll buy that.
What about him? He's harmless.
Back in the 60s, he was part of
the free-speech movement at Berkeley.
He did a little too much LDS. LDS?
I'll give you a lift.
I have a notorious weakness
for hard-luck cases.
We don't want to be any trouble. You've already been that. Come on.
Thank you very much.
Don't try anything. I've got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
So, you were at Berkeley? I was not.
Memory problems, too. Where are you from?
Iowa. A landlubber.
What the hell were you guys really trying to do back there?
Was it some kind of macho thing? I really hate that macho stuff.
Can I ask you a question? Go ahead.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
They'll have to take their chances. What does that mean exactly?
They'll be at risk from whale hunters just like all other humpbacks.
What did you mean with all that stuff about extinction?
He meant what you said on the tour, that humpbacks may well disappear.
That's not what he said, farmboy.
"We would be as guilty
as those who caused,
" past tense, "their extinction."
I have a photographic memory. I see words.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
Are you some dipshit army guy trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes?
No dipshit. Good, I'd have let you off here.
Gracie is pregnant.
Who are you? Don't jerk me around. How do you know that?
We can't tell you that. Let me finish.
We're not in the military and we intend no harm to the whales.
We may be able to help you in ways you couldn't possibly imagine.
Or believe, I'll bet. Very likely.
You're not catching us at our best. That much is certain.
I think we'd all be a lot happier discussing this over dinner.
What do you say?
Do you guys like Italian?
No. Yes.
Yes, I love Italian... and so do you.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager.
I'm terribly sorry. There's been an awful mix-up.
I was never told about your visit.
I tried to clear things up.
I explained that you'd come from Edinburgh
to study Plexicorp's manufacturing,
but they don't know anything about it.
Don't know anything about it?
I've come millions of miles. Thousands!
I was invited on an inspection. I demand to see the owners.
Dr. Nichols has offered to
take us around the plant personally.
He has? With pleasure.
That's different. Gregory.
May my assistant join us? Of course.
Don't bury yourself in the part.
Hi. A good-looking ship. Huey 204, isn't it?
Right on, do you fly? Here and there.
I flew something similar in my Academy days.
Then this must be old stuff to you. Yes...
But interesting. Can I ask you a few questions?
This is a fine place you have here.
Thank you. Your knowledge of engineering is most impressive.
Back home we call him the miracle worker.
May I offer you something?
May I offer something to you?
Yes? You're still working with polymers.
What else would I be working with?
What else indeed?
How thick would a piece of
your plexiglas need to be,
at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
Six inches. We have it in stock. I've noticed.
Now, suppose...
...I were to show you a way to manufacture a wall
that would do the same job, but be only one inch thick.
Would that be worth something? You're joking.
Perhaps the professor could use your computer.
Computer...
Computer!
Hello, computer. Just use the keyboard.
A keyboard, how quaint!
Transparent aluminum? That's the ticket, laddie.
It would take years to figure out the dynamics of this matrix.
Yes, but you would be rich beyond the dreams of avarice.
So, is it worth something to you, or should I punch up "clear"?
No.
Not now, Madeline.
What exactly did you have in mind?
A moment alone, please.
Do you realize that if we give him the formula,
we're altering the future?
Why? How do we know he didn't invent the thing?
Yeah.
Won't you change your mind?
What is wrong with the one I have?
A little joke. Goodbye, old friend. Wait a minute.
Nobody knows that Gracie is pregnant.
Gracie does. I'll be right here.
Is he just going to hang around the bushes while we eat?
It's his way.
Do you trust me? Implicitly.
Large mushroom and pepperoni, with extra onions and a Michelob.
Great choice. And you, sir? Make that two.
How does a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
Just lucky, I guess. You're upset about losing the whales.
You're very perceptive.
How will that be done, exactly?
They'll be flown to Alaska.
They'll be released there.
That's the last you'll see of them?
See, yes.
But we'll tag them
with special transmitters and monitor them.
I could take those whales somewhere...
...where they'd never be hunted.
You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco
without a lift.
If I'm so inept,
how come we're having dinner?
I'm a sucker for hard-luck cases. Cheers.
Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy
who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you "Admiral".
Where could you take them... my whales?
Where would they be safe? It's not a matter of where,
but when.
It would have to be right now. Why?
No humpback born in captivity has ever survived.
But they won't be safe at sea because of
all the hunting this time of year.
So you see, that, as they say, is that.
Damn.
What is that? You have a pocket pager.
Are you a doctor?
I told you not to call me.
Sorry, I thought you'd like to know.
We're beaming them in now. All right. Good luck. Kirk out.
You want to try it from the top? Tell me when the whales are leaving.
Who are you? Who do you think I am?
Don't tell me! You're from outer space.
I'm from Iowa, I work in outer space.
I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into this.
The truth? I am all ears.
Okay... the truth.
I am from the late 23rd century.
I've come back in time
to bring two humpback whales with me, in an attempt to...
...repopulate the species.
Why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
You want the details? Oh, I wouldn't miss this.
When are the whales being released? Okay, what the hell.
Your friend was right. Gracie is pregnant, very pregnant.
At noon tomorrow, in a media circus,
the whales get shipped out.
Noon tomorrow? Are we leaving?
We don't have much time. Could we have that to go?
Sure. Who gets the bad news? They don't use money in your time?
Well, we don't.
How long? It depends on the shielding.
Well, Admiral, that was the briefest dinner I've ever had,
and certainly the biggest fish story I've ever heard.
Tell me something. The whale's transmitter, what's the frequency?
Sorry, that's classified. Look, I don't have a clue who you are.
You wouldn't want to show me around your spaceship, would you?
That wouldn't be my first choice. Well, there we are.
I am here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd century.
I can go to the open sea to get them.
I'd rather have yours.
It's better for me. It's better for you. It's better for them.
Think about it.
Who are you? Think about it.
Don't take too long. I'm out of time.
This is where I'll be. Here?
In the park. Right.
The tank will be finished by morning. That's cutting it close.
What about team two? We're waiting for them to call.
Damn! We've been so lucky. Two perfect whales right here.
Now we might lose them.
Then our mission would fail.
Our mission? You're talking about the end of every life on Earth.
You're half human. Haven't you got any feelings about that?
There it is again. That's too weird. Commander.
Aren't you running the test program?
We're getting a power drain.
It must be coming from inside the ship.
Commander Rogerson. Yes, Chief,
we're tracking that, too. What is it?
Scotty, we're ready for beam-out.
Scotty, can you hear me?
Confirmed. Roger that.
This is Commander Rogerson.
We have an intruder in number four M.M.R.
Scotty, do you read? Lass, I can hardly hear you.
Power is down to minimal. I'll bring you in one at a time.
Take the collector. You go first.
Stand by.
Scotty.
Hello?
Come in, please.
Scotty, how soon?
Chekov, you're breaking up. Please signal again.
Can you hear me? Now would be a good time.
Freeze!
Chekov!
I've lost him.
Commander Pavel Chekov. Starfleet. United Federation of Planets.
Right, Commander, is there anything you want to tell us?
Like what? Who you are and what these are?
I am Pavel Chekov, a commander in Starfleet.
Service number: 656-5827 D.
Let's take it from the top. The top of what?
Name? My name?
Play games with me, and you're through.
I am? May I go now?
What do you think? He's a Russkie.
Of course he's a Russkie,
but he's a retard or something.
Don't move. Okay, give us the ray gun.
If you don't lie on the floor, I will have to stun you.
Okay, stun me. I'm very sorry.
It must be the radiation.
Gangway!
Hit the deck!
Man down. Get a corpsman over here.
Any luck? Nothing. I shouldn't have left him.
You did what was necessary. Keep trying, you'll find him.
Scotty, you promised an estimate on the crystals.
It'll be well into tomorrow.
You've got to do better.
I'll try, sir. He's in a wee bit of a snit.
He's a man of deep feelings. What's new?
They left last night.
We thought it would be easier on you this way.
You sent them away without even letting me say goodbye!
Admiral! Admiral Kirk!
Admiral Kirk!
Admiral Kirk!
Admiral Kirk, can you hear me?
They're gone. I need your help. Are you in there?
Admiral, we have a problem.
Admiral Kirk!
Admiral Kirk! Can you hear me?
Oh, my God!
Hello, Alice. Welcome to wonderland.
It's true! Yes, it is.
I'm glad you're here, but you picked a hell of a time to drop in.
Is this real? Yes, take a look.
Storage tanks for your whales. They're gone.
Gone? They were taken last night.
They're in Alaska by now. Damn!
But you can go find them, right? I can't go anywhere.
What kind of a spaceship is this? It's a spaceship with a missing man.
Full power has been restored. Thank you, Mr. Spock.
Doctor, welcome aboard.
Admiral, are you there? Uhura, what's wrong?
I've located Chekov. They're taking him to emergency surgery.
Where? Mercy Hospital.
The Mission District. His condition is critical.
He's not expected to survive.
Let me go in there. Don't leave him in the hands of 20th-century medicine.
I suggest that Dr. McCoy is correct. We must help Chekov.
Is that the logical thing to do? No, but it is the human thing to do.
Right. Will you help us?
How? We'll have to look like physicians.
We'll try down here. You check there.
What's the matter? Kidney dialysis.
Dialysis? What is this, the Dark Ages?
Here, swallow that. If you have any problems, call me.
Here, I've got it.
Let's go.
He's being held in the security corridor one flight up.
His condition is critical.
Excuse me, we'll take that.
Hold the door. Emergency.
I was there. I heard the whole thing.
Weintraub said radical chemotherapy.
What about Gottlieb?
He talked about image therapy.
Unbelievable! You have a different view?
It sounds like the Spanish inquisition. Bad day.
Out of the way. We have orders...
Damn it! This is an acute case
of upper-abdominal distension.
Get out of the way!
What did you say she's got? Cramps.
You aren't masked! Who are these people?
I don't know. What are you doing?
Tearing of the meningeal artery. What's your degree in, dentistry?
How do you explain slow pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
A funduscopic examination... ...is unrevealing.
An evacuation of the haematoma will relieve the pressure.
Drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired.
Put away your butcher knives and let me save this patient.
I'll have you removed. Such unprofessional behavior...
Into that little room. What is that? A gun?
What is this? I've no idea.
He melted the lock.
We're dealing with medievalism here.
Chemotherapy! Funduscopic examinations!
Chekov, wake up.
Pavel, can you hear me?
He's coming around. Pavel, talk to me.
Name? Rank?
Chekov, Pavel.
Rank: Admiral.
How's the patient? He's going to make it.
You came in with a she. One little mistake.
Get us out of here.
They've taken the patient.
Hold it!
Not now, Pavel. Hold it.
The doctor gave me a pill and I grew a new kidney.
It's fully functional!
Freeze.
Where would the whales be by now? Do you have a chart?
Just give me the radio frequency.
What? I'm coming with you.
Our next stop is the 23rd century.
So, I've got nobody here.
I've got to help those whales. I've got no time to argue.
The radio frequency, please. 401 megahertz.
Thank you... for everything.
Scotty, beam me up.
Surprise.
Spock, where the hell's the power? One damn minute, Admiral.
I'm trying to remember how this worked. I got used to a Huey.
You tricked me. You need me.
Take a seat. Now, Mr. Sulu.
What was that?
Cloaking device is stable. All systems normal.
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing: Five by zero. Helm: Steady.
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer 310.
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz.
10,000, Admiral.
Full impulse power.
310 to the Bering Sea. ETA: 12 minutes.
Are the whale tanks secure? Aye, but we're beaming up 400 tons.
It's not just the whales, it's the water.
Yes, of course.
Any contact? Negative.
You appear to have a problem. Your perception is correct.
In order to return us to the exact moment
we left the 23rd century
I calculated the time elapsed in relation to the acceleration curve.
Naturally. So what's your problem?
Acceleration is no longer a constant. Then take your best shot.
Best shot? Guess, Spock.
Your best guess. Guessing is not in my nature.
Well, nobody's perfect.
That's it! Affirmative. Contact with the whales.
Bearing: 327. Range: 600 nautical.
Put it on the screen. How can you do that?
I have a signal closing in on the whales, bearing 328 degrees.
Let's see it.
What kind of ship is that? A whaling ship. Are we too late?
Full-power descent. Aye, sir.
Ten seconds, sir.
All right, Scotty. Ten seconds, Admiral.
Five, four, three...
...two, one.
Admiral, there be whales here!
Well done. Do we have warp speed? Full power now, sir.
If you will, Mr. Sulu. Aye, sir. Warp speed.
Mr. Sulu, I'm going to take our guest to look at her whales.
How does the variable mass of whales
fit into our re-entry program?
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures...
I will make a guess. A guess?
You, Spock? That's extraordinary.
I don't think he understands. No.
He feels safer about your guesses than most people's facts.
You're saying it is a compliment? It is.
Then I will make the best guess I can.
"They say the sea is cold, but the sea contains the hottest blood of all."
"Whales Weep Not", D.H. Lawrence.
It's ironic. When man was killing these creatures,
he was destroying his own future.
The beasties seem happy to see you.
I hope you like our aquarium.
A miracle, Mr. Scott. A miracle? That's yet to come.
What does that mean?
We might not make it. You should have stayed where you belong.
I belong here. I am a whale biologist.
Suppose by some miracle you do get them through?
Who in the 23rd century knows anything about humpback whales?
Admiral, you'd better get up there. We're having a power fall off.
Stay with them. I'm on my way.
Hold on tight.
Warp 7.5.
7.9. Shields at maximum.
That's all I can give you.
Can we make breakaway speed? I cannot guarantee it.
I shall compensate by altering our trajectory.
Warp 8... 8.1. Maximum speed.
I need thruster control. Thrusters at Spock's command.
Steady... Steady! Now!
Did breaking thrusters fire? They did, Admiral.
Then where the hell are we?
The probe.
Condition report. Computers are non-functional.
The mains are down. Aux. Power is not responding.
Switch to manual control. I have no control, sir.
Where are we? Out of control and blind as a bat.
Get him back.
Look! They're heading for the bridge.
Keep the nose up if you can.
We're in the water. Blow the hatch.
Now all we have to do is get the whales out of here.
Scotty, do you hear me?
Move! See to the safety of all hands.
Lassie, get my arm. I've got it.
Admiral, help! I'm here, Scotty.
You're going to be all right. The whales are trapped.
There's no power to the bay door. Explosive override?
It's underwater. We can't reach it.
You go on ahead. Close the hatch.
You'll be trapped. Go on!
Do you see them?
There!
Why don't they answer? Why don't they sing?
Mr. President, we have power.
The Council is now in session.
If you will all take your seats.
Bring in the accused.
Capt. Spock, you do not stand accused.
Mr. President, I stand with my shipmates.
As you wish.
The charges are...
Conspiracy. Assault on Federation officers.
Theft of Federation property, namely the Starship Enterprise.
Sabotage of the U.S.S. Excelsior.
Destruction of Federation property, specifically the U.S.S. Enterprise.
And finally, disobeying direct orders of the Starfleet Commander.
Admiral Kirk, how do you plead?
On behalf of all of us, I'm authorized to plead guilty.
So entered.
Because of mitigating circumstances, all charges but one are dismissed.
The charge of disobeying orders of a superior officer
is directed solely at Admiral Kirk.
I'm sure the Admiral will recognize the necessity for discipline?
I do, sir. James T. Kirk...
It is the judgment of this council that you be reduced in rank to captain.
As a consequence of your new rank,
you will be given the duties for which you have demonstrated great ability.
The command of a starship.
Silence.
You and your crew have saved this planet from its own short-sightedness.
We are forever in your debt.
I'm so happy for you.
Thank you so much.
Wait a minute, where are you going? You have your ship, I have mine.
Science vessel. I've got 300 years of learning to do.
You mean, this is goodbye? Why does it have to be goodbye?
Like they say in your century, I don't even have your phone number.
How will I find you? Don't worry... I'll find you.
See you around the galaxy.
Father.
I am returning to Vulcan within the hour. I'd like to take my leave of you.
It was kind of you to make this effort. It was no effort. You are my son.
Besides, I am most impressed with your performance in this crisis.
Most kind.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet.
It is possible that judgment was incorrect.
Your associates are people of good character.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course.
Any message for your mother? Yes.
Tell her... I feel fine.
Live long and prosper, Father. Live long and prosper, my son.
The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe.
We'll get a freighter. I'm counting on "Excelsior".
Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
A ship is a ship. Whatever you say, sir. Thy will be done.
My friends... we've come home.
Helm ready, Captain. All right, let's see what she's got.
