It won't work, MacGyver.
You can't do it!
Why not?!
I've done it before!
Not with 400 pounds.
It's no problem, I tell you!
Look out, Paul!
MacGyver!
Please... cut me loose.
Forget it!
Damn you!
We're both going to die!
No one's gonna die!
No one's gonna die.
No one's gonna die.
Afternoon. Name's MacGyver.
Invitation, please.
Quiet.
But slowly.
It's all right, uh...
I'm a guest.
I just haven't had time to
unpack the invitation.
Thank you, Mr. MacGyver.
You may enter.
Thank you very much.
Good dog.
Exactly.
MacGyver.
There he is!
Hey!
Hey!
How's me old mate?
Happy birthday,
Paul.
Look at you.
This is fantastic.
I can't believe it's
been fifteen years.
Oh, come on,
don't remind me.
That's ridiculous.
All right, thanks
for coming.
It means a lot.
You kidding me?
I wouldn't miss this.
You only turn forty
once in your life, I hear,
although in your case...
Yeah- I-
No, thank you.
So, uh, did you like the car
I had waiting for you?
Well, it's, uh...
red.
But, uh- Yes, it's
very nice. Thanks.
Well, at least you didn't
roll it this time.
It's early.
Oh, by the way...
you still owe me
a new pair of ski poles.
Oh, much more
than that, my friend.
Much more.
I, uh...
I never told you how much
your letters meant
when I lost Elizabeth.
I'm sorry I couldn't have
been here for you.
We had some good times...
didn't we, Mac?
Absolutely the best.
Everything all right with you?
Paul?
We have to talk.
Daddy...
Elise, Natalia.
Now you can actually meet
this wonderful man.
MacGyver,
my daughter Elise,
a doctoral candidate at 19.
And, uh, if you'll forgive
a little paternal bragging,
my most trusted
and gifted associate.
Papa, please.
Very nice to meet you again.
You, too.
You look just like your mom.
Thank you.
MacGyver, Natalia Krimm,
a close friend of the family.
The man who carried me
up a mountain on his back.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.
MacGyver and I spent the '70s
brainstorming solutions
to save the world.
What a shame they didn't work.
We're still trying.
There's the man I want to see.
Frederick Moran, Paul's brother.
I'm honored, Mr. MacGyver.
Frederick.
It's good to finally meet you.
Thanks for making
all this happen.
Oh. My great pleasure.
I wanted to meet you years ago,
but I was far too busy working,
to afford this place.
Excuse us.
I must steal
our guest of honor.
Of course.
Your trip was
satisfactory, I hope.
Yeah, it was great.
Um...
got a little bumpy
at your guard gate there.
Oh. My apologies.
Sadly, a necessity these days.
There's already been
one attempt on my life.
Really?
Yes, two years ago,
in the heart of the city.
It seems that nowadays anyone
with money is a target.
Particularly
a wealthy industrialist.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.
Would you all come
a little closer?
Yes, that's right, thank you.
Please, come in.
I would like to introduce you to
a very special friend
of this family.
In fact, there would be
no celebration
of my brother's birthday today...
had it not been
for this man's heroism.
So please, I'd like you all
to raise your glasses
for a very special toast.
Get down. Get down.
It's nothing.
It's my shoulder.
Help the others.
Frederick.
It's Paul.
They've shot
Paul.
Call the paramedics.
No.
Paul. Paul.
Sample...
pack.
What?
What?
Paul.
Paul, come on.
Come on.
Paul.
Sir. They've taken your niece.
They've kidnapped her.
Elise.
I'm Tony Graves, family friend.
Where's Mr. Moran?
He's in the study, sir.
Thanks.
I'm not interested in statements.
I want action.
Do you understand?
Look. Try to get hold of
yourself, Mr. Moran.
Frederick!
Frederick, I... I'm so sorry.
If there's anything I can do.
Thank you, Tony.
You can step aside, Mr. Graves,
and allow the police
to do their work.
Oh, sorry, captain,
I forgot how, uh,
easily you get confused.
Don't get smart with me, Graves.
I can make life
very difficult for you.
Oh, really?
Chief superintendent, this is
my home. Remember that.
And this is my investigation,
Mr. Moran.
We must all understand that.
Excuse me, sir.
Yes, what is it?
Thank you.
They found a body by the river.
It could be the girl's.
Can you wait here, please?
Mr. Moran, the face,
it's been battered.
Elise...
Oh, no.
From one generation to another.
This was to have been
the happiest week of my life.
Expectations of joy.
Renewed friendships.
And now, my brother is gone.
My whole family.
It's very hard.
They will always
live in our hearts.
It's a sad day for
all of us, Frederick.
MacGyver...
forgive me for ignoring you.
You came from so far...
No, don't even think about it.
Rest as long as you like.
My secretary will gladly handle
your return arrangements.
That won't be necessary,
Frederick.
I insist.
You're my guest.
Well...
I've changed my plans.
I'm not leaving.
Paul was too good a friend.
Not leaving?
MacGyver, please.
Let the police handle this.
Well, the police can have
their investigation,
I'll have mine.
Besides, I'm a new face in town.
Working alone, maybe I can do
some things the police can't.
You are indeed the man
Paul said you were.
Bless you, MacGyver.
My resources are
at your disposal.
I will support you
in any way I can.
Thank you.
Perhaps...
Tony can be of help too.
As a liaison.
Troubleshooter.
His background is Intelligence.
I'd be...
proud to help.
Good.
Good.
And, if we could persuade
our uniquely qualified-
No.
Frederick, please...
But Natalia...
I said no.
I'm sorry, MacGyver.
Look, it's getting late.
I could use a lift home.
Thank you for the lift.
I'm sorry if I offended you
with my reaction to Frederick.
Oh, it's kind of tough
to offend me.
Mind if I ask why
you did react like that?
I do mind, as a matter of fact.
Thank you for escorting me.
I think I'm quite capable
of letting myself in.
I bet.
Wait.
Hey!
Damn them.
Damn them!
Any ideas?
Of course.
Terrorists, who else?
Why would they hit you?
I've been seen with Frederick.
Photographed. You know the press.
Always linking people together.
They love rumors.
With all due respect,
this looks like
more than just rumors.
Fortunately, I'm not dependent on
material possessions.
Whoop.
Well...
Looks like they forgot one of
your material possessions.
Please give it to me.
All right, look.
You move like a cat,
you handle a gun like a pro,
and you've got a poison
cartridge pen in your purse.
Is there anything
you want to tell me
about your...unique
qualifications?
There's nothing to tell.
Yeah, right.
I've run across a couple of
these things in my time.
And every one of them
belonged to a KGB agent.
Come on, Miss Krimm.
All right.
I was studying
languages in Moscow.
I was approached and
offered a job with the KGB.
Most of my time
working for them
was spent in London.
But it's over now.
Past.
I broke all ties
years ago.
So what do you do now?
Little work for Frederick.
Mostly I keep to myself.
Let me ask you something.
You still have contacts
in this town?
I told you, I broke
all ties years ago.
But you still know people, right?
Please...
leave me out of it.
I don't want to
renew those connections.
Hey. I'm not too familiar with
the terrorist scene around here.
I could use some help
getting in, okay?
I said no.
It's not my business.
I keep to myself.
Look...
the Morans have been a very
important part of my life,
and they have just
been crucified.
I was told you were
a good friend of the family.
Well, you've got a chance
to prove it right now.
I could use your help.
So could they.
Really.
Wow.
Yeah. Sleep well.
MacGyver.
Tell me what you need.
This is an honor, comrade.
To be on the same level
with someone of your rank.
Stop it, Nikolai.
This is the man I-
Did you bring the money?
Your turn.
This group is very dangerous.
They have no political agenda.
They're antiestablishment
anarchists.
They'll work for anyone.
Qaddafi, the I.R.A., you name it.
They're very violent.
Can I get in?
I can make contact
with their leader today.
His name is Joseph.
I'll take care of
the details. He trusts me.
But I warn you.
If they suspect you...
they will kill you.
Set it up.
Gentlemen.
Which one's Joseph?
Joseph's watching.
First you got to prove
yourself against our best.
Ow.
Very impressive.
Now finish him off.
Go on.
You've earned it.
It's a stupid leader who
sacrifices his own men.
I was looking for professionals,
not a bunch of suicidal punks.
All right.
You've earned yourself
a private meeting.
You come with good references,
and Nikolai says you're solid.
We'll let you know
when and where.
Swell.
Yeah.
Nice bridge.
Yeah. Well, things are risky
at the moment, all right?
Oh, feeling a little heat,
are you? Police?
No.
Who?
Big money.
The Moran job was for hire,
but something's turned.
That's why you're here.
Three of our strike team
have disappeared.
The other's afraid
to surface.
He hasn't shown
at our regular meeting spot.
Yeah, where's that?
Just listen.
I'll give you the information
you need.
The money knows
where we meet.
It's become very dangerous.
All right, so it's dangerous.
Where's this meeting place?
In the sewers.
We meet at the fourth quadrant.
Fourth quadrant. All right.
Our stray's coming to my place
tonight at 11:30.
Be there.
You'll get instructions
for your first assignment.
Wanna give me some hint
as to what that might be?
Our ace in the hole
stashed at the meeting spot.
The suit's own handwritten
request for the hit.
And photos he gave me
of the target.
You're gonna retrieve them
for us, tough guy.
Eleven-thirty,
all right? Be there.
Well, you can't go in
without it, MacGyver.
If you don't wear a wire,
we'll have no way of knowing
if anything goes wrong.
I don't like wires.
If something does go wrong,
they're impossible to explain.
Well, I'm telling you,
it's foolhardy.
You'll be walking in naked.
Look, just listen to me
on this, okay?
I'm experienced
in these matters.
So am I.
Damn it, man-
What?
It was my, uh-
It was-
It was my understanding
that you were...open
to assistance.
Yeah. Assistance, yes.
Orders, no.
I'm not giving orders.
Tony...
why don't you go
and wait in the car?
Please?
I'll be down in a minute.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes Tony can be
a little overbearing.
He's used to being in charge.
Yeah, so am I.
He means well.
And you are very stubborn.
Really?
It's part of your charm.
How can I help?
Okay. We know somebody
other than Joseph
was behind all this,
so you can start by making
a list of people
who might have wanted
Frederick dead.
You mean-?
Anybody you can think of.
Including his friends.
Ugh!
Paul.
What's going on here?
It's all right.
You're all right now.
Oh.
Why am I naked?
Nikolai found you in Soho
and called me.
You've been very sick.
Why are we in bed together?
You were burning up
with fever, then chills.
I- I couldn't think
of what else to do.
Oh.
I saw this once in
an American movie.
We watched many of those
during KGB training.
Um...
Mind if I ask what
happened here, exactly?
The details are unimportant.
Let's just say your fever broke.
My fever?
We've lost a lot of time.
We should get to work.
What do you mean, "we"?
I'm just here to help.
Your clothes, sir.
Why did the terrorists
want to kill you?
They didn't.
I think it was the people
who hired them.
What?
Yeah.
My contact was hit.
The Moran attack
wasn't terrorist,
and it wasn't aimed at Frederick.
Who, then?
Paul.
Are you sure?
I think so.
There were some pictures of Paul
and a...
handwritten note from
whoever ordered the hit.
I was supposed to get 'em, but...
Do you know who?
Did you read the note?
No.
There wasn't time.
All I know is somebody
had Paul killed,
and that same somebody
wants me out of the way.
Who'd want to hurt dear Paul?
I don't know.
But something was bugging him
the day of the party.
He started to tell me, but...
Maybe it's got
something to do with his work.
I need to get into his lab.
Tony Graves can arrange that.
How?
His company funded Paul's work.
What's going on?
There's been a break-in
at Paul's lab.
A break-in?
Yeah, about an hour ago.
What were they after?
I don't know.
Thank you.
Dr. Massey?
This is Mr. MacGyver.
Dr. Massey, good to meet you.
Oh, of course, forgive me.
Paul's friend.
Oh, and, uh,
this is Natalia Krimm.
She's a close friend
of the Morans.
How do you do?
Well, doctor, it looks like-
Excuse me, doctor.
I'm sorry.
Is this what Paul was working on?
Paul was fine-tuning a portable
mass spectrometer he designed.
But not just any.
The most highly sensitive
ever developed.
For the START signatories.
Capable of measuring
the slightest nuclear presence.
Huh. Big stuff, huh?
It's such a tragedy.
The death of my brilliant
colleague,
and now the desecration
of his work.
Did you notice anything missing?
Oh, everything.
His records, files,
all his samples.
Work in progress.
What samples?
Of what?
Well, Paul had just completed
the first air sample test
for the new machine,
from all over England.
Now everything's gone:
the samples,
records, results,
everything.
Graves.
I'm getting tired of finding you
at my crime scenes.
You have no business
here. Now, get out.
And that goes
for the rest of you-
Hey- Excuse me,
chief superintendent,
but, um...
it was my company
that financed this lab.
I don't give a damn
what you financed
with your filthy money.
Watch it, Capshaw.
Don't threaten me, Graves.
I forgot what a tough guy
you were.
What was it?
Eleven counts
of excessive force, one death.
Oh, you don't frighten me,
you pompous little ass!
Hey, hey!
Come on, gentlemen.
Please.
I want this lab clearednow.
Dr. Massey?
Hm?
Paul mentioned the word
"samples" to me
just before he died.
Do you know anything
about his findings?
Whatsamples he might
have been referring to?
No, that's my frustration.
Paul never spoke to anyone
about his work, except Elise,
God rest her soul.
Oh, she was his confidant.
Brilliant mind.
Of course, the man
lived for his research.
I mean, he slept here.
This was his second home.
Wait a minute.
Paul slept here?
Yes. Yeah, well, yes, at times.
He kept a little room upstairs.
Right. Clear the room, please.
It seems you don't
understand English.
Leave the room immediately.
MacGyver...
you're getting dangerously close
to interfering in my territory.
Now please, stay out
of my investigation.
Two minutes.
I just needed two
more minutes in that room.
Why?
I'm gonna take you home.
I'll contact you later.
What is this?
Have I outlived my usefulness?
Just try to understand, will you?
What?
Ten minutes ago we were
working as a team.
Now, suddenly, you don't trust me.
Look, this is nothing personal,
but right now, I can't
afford to trust anybody.
Damn you!
Who just saved your life?
Who nursed you back to health?
Natalia, believe me...
you've helped a lot.
And I appreciate
everything you've done.
You need me, MacGyver.
Oh, I do, do I?
I'm a better spy than you are...
in matters requiring deceit.
Capshaw's always hated Tony.
He hides that well.
Years ago, Tony worked
for a brief time
with British Intelligence.
He was in American Intelligence
stationed in the U.K.
It all ended very badly
for him, though,
when a terrorist suspect
died during questioning.
Graves killed somebody?
That was never really determined.
But Capshaw had the misfortune
of being present
as a young officer.
He's hated Tony
for it ever since.
Apparently, he feels
his reputation and career
were permanently smeared.
Mr. MacGyver.
Yeah?
Your results.
Thanks.
I don't believe it.
W- What is it?
The air sample shows
high level of uranium isotope.
U-235.
So?
It's what they use to make
nuclear bombs.
Uncontrolled nuclear material
is being processed
somewhere nearby.
In England?
But that can't be.
Oh, well, this says it can.
Somebody's operating
a nuclear facility,
and Paul found it.
Why?
The cold war is over.
I don't know.
Maybe it's just about...
money.
Money?
Maybe.
Think about it.
Terrorist groups.
Rogue nations like Iraq,
Iran, Libya,
they'd pay anything
for nuclear capability.
And if there is somebody
who can supply 'em,
I don't even want to
think of the implications.
I gotta find out where
the sample came from.
MacGyver.
No.
Listen to me. We're
both under surveillance.
We can't go back
to your place or mine.
You're a target.
We need a safe house
we can use as a base.
I'll find us one.
All right.
C-A-R...
C.
It's a C.
Thank you.
Look here.
The castle was last
purchased in 1983
by Lyndover Limited,
a trading company.
Thank you.
Okay.
"Graves."
You're a lucky guy.
X-rays show no sign
of cerebral damage
or concussion.
However, I'd be more
careful about the company
I keep in the future.
Would you excuse us, doctor?
Yeah.
Hey, chief. Now what?
Well, "now what" is we're
gonna have a little talk
about life, MacGyver.
Life and manners.
All right.
Well...
when a stranger conducts
a private investigation
in my city
and refuses to share
his findings with the police,
I call that bad manners.
I agree.
So, what were
you doing at the, uh,
laboratory and the London Library?
You find something?
With all due respect,
chief inspector,
I don't feel free to
comment on that right now.
Don't test me, MacGyver.
You know...
throwing your allegiance
to scum like Tony Graves
can only bring you more trouble.
Like today.
Nobody has my allegiance.
That particular association
makes me seriously
question your motives.
I have no association,
no obligation, no ties.
I am strictly in this
for personal reasons.
Well I do have obligations
and associations.
To Britain and
her subjects, MacGyver.
For your sake, let's hope
we're on the same side.
It doesn't make sense.
A nuclear plant,
built without detection,
and so close.
I've known Tony for many years.
I can't imagine him
being involved
in anything so repugnant.
Why even though...
What?
Tony always had
a very strong drive
for material gain.
That's why we had to
sever our business ties.
Really?
But selling nuclear weapons?
That's global terrorism.
Tony fought that all his life.
Look at his service record.
Twelve years, U.S. Intelligence,
an antiterrorist expert.
Yeah. I know.
I ran a background check on him,
and aside from that incident
with British Intelligence,
he was clean.
We must call in the authorities.
This is getting too big.
No, wait a minute,
wait a minute. J-
Don't we want to see
how deep this thing goes?
Yes, we must.
For Tony's sake.
Chief Superintendent Capshaw
might very well use this
as an opportunity
for vengeance against him.
This note that you found...
was there anything on it?
A name, initials.
Anything that might lead us
to my brother's murderers?
Uh. No, I didn't get
a chance to read it.
Do what you have
to do, MacGyver.
I back you a hundred percent.
Graves.
Oh, man.
Armed police.
Don't move!
Stay down!
I said, stay down!
I warn you, MacGyver,
I get nervous in the presence
of murderers.
What? Wait a minute.
Shut up.
Don't even try.
This yours?
Well, I'm sure it's
covered in prints.
Maybe even a blood sample.
Come on, that's a plant.
I didn't kill anybody.
Oh, really?
Sir.
So this wouldn't be
your watch crystal
and bezel then?
Come on, this is a setup.
Don't move!
You gotta listen to me!
I'm placing you under arrest for
the murder of Anthony Graves.
Aah! Ow.
After him!
Come on!
Ah.
Come on.
Ow.
Ow.
Was this door always like this?
No.
Can you get to the back
of the carriage, please. Now.
He got out! You checked
every carriage?
Yeah.
Come on then! Come on.
MacGyver.
Where have you been?
You set me up!
Are you crazy?
Capshaw was waiting for me.
Graves was dead,
and evidence againstme
was conveniently beside the body.
Tony, dead?
Oh, that's good.
That's so very good.
The KGB should be proud of you.
MacGyver, I didn't do it.
You and Frederick
were the only ones
who knew I was going there.
That's not necessarily true.
Yeah? Well then, who?!
All right.
Superintendent Capshaw.
I'm serious.
Think about it!
You've been followed
from the start.
He could have followed us
to Frederick's,
maybe even wired his study.
Tony could have been his partner.
So Capshaw knows
Tony was a suspect,
kills him and frames you
for the crime.
It could have been
a conspiracy all along.
Tony had law-enforcement
assistance.
And all that hostility
between them
was just a facade.
Capshaw could have ordered
the attack on you in the sewers.
That's how he got the evidence.
If it had been me, why would I
have bothered to save your life?
You dragged me
into this.
I wanted to put the KGB
behind me, remember?
Don't you know how I feel?
I'm on your side, all the way.
I need to think.
Nothing would surprise me
at this point.
And now I'm a suspect.
That's beautiful.
Beautiful.
I can help.
My KGB contact, Nikolai,
there's a rumor he's
found new employment.
So?
His expertise is
in nuclear facilities.
It could be
only one thing.
If it's true, I can verify
the location of the plant
and find out what kind of
security it has.
What makes you think
he'd tell you?
He'll tell me.
I'm KGB, remember?
Ex-KGB, remember?
Of course.
The circumstances
do not relieve you
of your legal responsibilities.
My family has been murdered.
My only brother killed.
And you speak to me like this?
How dare you!
Mr. Moran. I am
requesting information
as to the where abouts
of Mr. MacGyver, a fugitive.
With holding such
information is a crime.
I resent the accusation.
And your insensitivity,
chief superintendent.
Now get out.
As you say.
Yeah?
I'm outside Nikolai's now.
We rendezvous in exactly one hour.
If something happens
and I can't make it,
you must leave without me.
Natalia!
Ah.
Who are those guys?
Get in!
Morning, gents.
Where you heading
on those old plates?
What?
Plates of meat. Feet.
Oh, uh, Carcroft Castle.
You don't look like
royalty to me.
Jump on.
Come on.
What's your name?
MacGyver.
Scottish?
Eh...
Just call me Plato.
You like music?
Sure.
Good.
*I'm ready to rock *
Hold on. Here we go.
Thank you, sir.
Hey Plato, would you
mind stopping?
Can you cut the engines?
And the music?
I think that's for me, my friend.
Listen, it's a long story.
But I'm innocent.
Now, I don't want to
get you in trouble,
but I could use your help here.
Us blokes got to stick together.
Look like a couple
of ices anyway.
What?
Ice cream freezers.
Geezers.
Oh.
See you round the other side.
Switch the engine off please, sir.
And the music.
We're looking for this man.
Have you seen him
or anyone that looks like him?
Sorry.
If you do, will you notify
the police immediately?
Yes, officer.
Yeah.
Put your helmet on.
Yes. Yes, sir.
Hello, ladies.
We're looking for this gentleman.
You're a good man, Plato.
You be lucky, MacGyver.
So you're all together
there, are you?
Hello? Yes.
I realize that,
but you must understand,
the serum guarantees truth,
not cooperation.
I know.
Very well. I'll do my best.
Are you ready to begin?
I'm tired.
Elise, don't fight it.
You can't lie with the serum.
I'm tired.
We need the software code
to your father's spectrometer.
What makes it so sensitive?
How can we upgrade ours?
I told you everything.
You know as much as I do.
I worked with your father
for over five years.
And I have access
to almost all his research.
But I know he kept certain
information to himself.
Only one who had access
to all the files was you.
I did not see the files
you refer to.
We must have that information
to secure the plant
from further detection.
Elise, they will kill you.
Now, don't be foolish, my dear.
They'll kill you, you know that.
We've been through this
so many times before.
Elise, I must have an answer.
Try the library.
MacGyver.
My father. Is he...?
I'm sorry.
Elise...
They drugged me.
I woke up here.
Who are "they," Elise?
I don't know.
I answer questions
about the spectrometer.
They want one...
to monitor emissions.
Avoid another detection.
They're processing nuclear
materials in a facility
under the castle.
What?
You must hurry.
I heard them talking.
The first shipment leaves today.
Two tactical weapons.
I'm sorry.
I helped them.
I tried not to.
I really tried.
No. It's all right.
It's okay, honey.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I'll be back.
Don't touch that.
Please.
I was afraid you'd get this far.
Pity, MacGyver.
You're just too good
for your own good.
It was you all the time.
It's kind of hard to believe
anybody would be sick enough
to order the death
of his own brother.
Difficult decisions are the lot
of the entrepreneur, MacGyver.
Especially with stakes this high.
Yeah, what stakes?
Change is everywhere, my friend.
Yeltsin's democracy
could be the first to fall.
There's a Communist coup
in the works,
perhaps from the inside.
But as yet, my clients
are organizing themselves
from the outside.
Profits will be enormous.
You'd put the whole world
at risk...for profit?
Beautiful.
It is indeed beautiful.
I accomplished the impossible.
A state-of-the-art
nuclear facility
right here
in the heart of Britain.
Built...without detection.
Almost.
Paul found it.
Unfortunately.
It took me ten years
to build this plant.
Our products will be
used to take control
of Russia's nuclear arsenal,
before the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty takes effect.
I foresaw the demand,
and now the market is mine.
I am sole broker for nuclear
capability and devices...
for the world.
Well, what about conscience?
What aboutlaw?
This-
This is a violation of
the most basic and crucial laws
of civilized society.
You're offering
genocide for profit.
What are you thinking?
As I see it, MacGyver,
the law is simply one of
the risks of doing business.
Well, as I see it, Fred...
you're just one more
cheap crook.
Oh!
Your logic sucks.
"Tactical nuclear device."
Damn you.
For always succeeding.
For making me the one
to have to kill you.
Well...
I'm real sorry about that.
I didn't want it
to end this way...
Oh, knock it off.
But certain ends
require drastic means.
Yeah.
Ex-KGB my butt.
This is beyond KGB.
Beyond anything.
This is my family, my country,
the future of the Soviet Union.
Natalia, there is
no Soviet Union.
No.
I refuse to accept that.
I am a patriot.
I will never allow
the dissolution
of the KGB or the Soviet.
They stole my country.
I want it back.
That world is over.
No, that's lies!
I won't listen.
Your country is in the middle of
a massive transition right now.
Can't you see that what you're
doing is counterproductive?
I have a mission to preserve
the Soviet state.
You stand in the way.
Will you listen to yourself?
You don't understand.
You could never understand.
No one's ever stolen
your government,
discarded your beliefs,
left your people without dignity.
With nothing.
Well...
you seem to have things
well in hand, my dear.
So, MacGyver...
since you've been good enough
to deliver the evidence
you so cleverly hid
in the sewers,
there seems no further reason
to delay your demise.
Shoot him!
Can I say something...
before you do?
Natalia, y-
You realize
you're a phony...
and a total hypocrite here.
You don't care about
your people or your beliefs.
You're on the verge of
killing thousands and thousands
of people for
your precious Communism.
And your partner
in this...noble scheme...
is a greed-driven
billionaire capitalist
like Freddy boy here.
Shoot him!
Some Communist.
I admit there's
a certain hypocrisy
to that aspect
of the arrangement.
Just a little.
But quite honestly, it's been
my intention from the start...
to correct it.

You never give up, do you?
I guess it just wasn't
meant to be.
I owe you an apology, MacGyver.
We are on the same side.
Thanks for your help.
You bet, chief.
See you soon.
I hope.
My father cared
so much for this planet.
He just wanted to do some good.
He did.
The world's a safer place
because of Paul.
Maybe.
But my father,
your friend, he's gone.
Then I guess it's up to us.
