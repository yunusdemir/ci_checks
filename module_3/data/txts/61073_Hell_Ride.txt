Safe keep the treasure for my boy.
I know you'll
keep your word, baby.
Safe keep the treasure
for my boy.
Keep safe the treasure
for my boy.
Fucking arrow.
Fucking arrow in the middle
of the fucking desert.
It's a nihilist's dream
come true.
It's a hell
of a place to die.
It's a hell of
a way to die.
It was goddamn perfect.
Shut up.
You want a swig of this whiskey
before I pull that arrow?
It's my destiny
to die right here
with a fucking arrow
sticking out of me.
With any luck, The Gent and
Comanche will die laughing.
Guess I'm gonna
live another day.
You got that right.
Aw, hell.
Fucker's gotta burn!
Come on, hey!
Hey!
Hey!
This might be the best
dust I've ever seen.
Pistol, I've been up to my ass
in dust plenty of times
but this kind of dust
is like a supreme kind of dust
that's been sent
from some other planet.
I just want to live in dust
now for the rest of my life.
Shut the fuck up!
Where's Comanche?
He's over there
taking a piss.
He doesn't want to get
any dust on his dick.
When we ride, move him
up to my left.
His name is Bix.
Forget Bix.
From now on you're
known as Comanche.
Woman:
"Had they really nailed
everyone responsible
for St. Louie's death?"
thought Pistolero.
Sorry.
My finger got stuck.
Next time share a little.
The Six-Six-Sixers.
They're back.
Something is rotten
in the state of Pistolero.
Take this one, motherfucker!
So I say we
cut off their heads,
we take 'em with us.
I say we just take a few
pinkies and call it a day.
Hows about we take their stash,
torch the trailer,
and get the fuck
out of here?
Why don't you put a smile
on your face,
let some sunshine in?
Life is good.
You're having
a bad hair day.
Ask Comanche to take
a little off the top.
Thanks for that.
Danke schön for
the secondhand smoke.
You got right
on the edge there,
closer than a hair
on a gnat's ass.
What, on the verge
of the brink?
Yeah.
Reading the situation
exactly right
is how come I'm the pres.
Hey, Comanch, listen,
Pistolero wanted me
to pass on
some important
information to you.
There's a job opening
at Supercuts,
about two and a half
miles up the road.
Those motherfuckers
had it coming.
Louie really was
a fucking saint.
Yeah.
I'm gonna keep cutting up
any motherfucker
that had anything
to do with him dying.
Trigger?
You named your bike
after a horse.
Exactly how old
is Trigger
in horse-bike years?
She's younger than
the woman I saw you with
in that bar in Reno
last week.
And I gotta tell you,
she's less horsey-looking too.
Pistolero wants you
on his left.
Speechless, eh?
The left, huh?
I never seen anybody
move up so fast before.
I'll do my best
to remember that.
Anything you want to get
off your chest,
anything you want
to talk about,
just think of us as a
support group.
Well, golly gee.
Thanks.
Let's get the fuck out of
this motherfucking hellhole!

Bob The Bum, it's good to be

Hey, can we talk?
You want to talk?
Yeah, it's kind of
important.
Now?
Yeah, this is kind of like
real fucking important.
Can't it wait a couple
of hours, you bum?
We'll talk in about
a month and a half.

Woman's voice:
It was America's Bicentennial.
And for Johnny, St. Louie,
and Eddie Zero,
rebellion was
still in the air.
Sonny.
Cherokee's voice:
The three Victors had a little business
with The Deuce
and Billy Wings.
It was the beginning
of bad blood.
Woman:
Wanna fuck?
# Fast train... #
Trust me, after I
give you the bad news
you ain't gonna
want to fuck
ever again.
# What's at the heart #
Fuck me good one more time
before you never want
to fuck again.
I'm the messenger
of misery, baby.
# Of your engine's rage? #
Let's fuck first.
Then I'll deliver
my miserable message.
# To what smooth place #
# At the end of the line #
# With crackling fires #
# And quiet plains #
# Do the trees bend down #
# Fold their limbs
round you? #
# Welcome home,
faithful one... #
Let's fuck right here.
We never fucked right here
before.
Fuck me good
right here, baby.
If you don't fuck me
right now
you're going
straight to hell.
Baby, I'm already in hell.
Apparently I made
a reservation this morning.
Did you make
your reservation for two?
It's a very strict
dress code in hell.
You just can't
waltz into hell.
- There's a doorman outside...
- Baby...
I was built for hell.
I'm your devil babe.
I'm your very own
personal hellcat...
hellhole.
Mmm.
Baby, you're good.
Maybe you're bad.
Give me the info.
Can I ask you
something first?
Go ahead.
Just what kind of
fucking president are you?
Everybody wants
you assassinated.
Maybe you don't belong
in the presidential suite.
I'm better than the C.I.A.,
better than the internet,
better than the "Enquirer."
I'm better than all
of them put together.
I've gathered
more intelligence
than anyone
you've ever met.
I'm better than
Deep Throat.
Give me the fucking info.
Okay.
The Six-Six-Sixers
are reforming
in the City of Angels.
The Deuce and Billy Wings
are back with a vengeance.
Always pay your debts
to Billy Wings.
Late last night a message
was sent to all hellraisers.
It said The Deuce would
like life a lot better
if he was living
in Victors territory.
Give me something new,
will you?
This whole
Deuce business
has something
to do with 1976,
something to do with
that Cherokee Kisum woman.
That's all I wanted to hear.
Now we fuck.
Get much out of Opium yet?
Yep. Flowing red in there,
Blood Alley.
What do you got so far?
How much can you live with?
I can stomach anything
I gotta stomach.
Speed and Machete,
they're tied to The Deuce.
Were. They're finito.
Goody Two-Shoes
just called in.
Speed and the Six-Six-Sixers,
they set up the St. Louie
crack buy... with Opium.
Six-Six-Sixers are
definitely coming at us.
Deuce and Billy Wings
are coming.
Meet me tomorrow in Tucson.
Dani's Inferno. 3:00 P.M.
You got that?
I got it.
How much did The Deuce pay you
to set up St. Louie?
Stand up.
I'm sorry.
Please.
Right from the start
I treated you like a son.
Oh, well. Family
isn't everything.
No.
Where's The Deuce, Doc?
And where's Pistolero?
I guess I'm just
a fuckup, Billy.
I guess you are.
I guess I won't be needing
your services anymore.
You're off the payroll,
Doc.
# Might have been a time #

- Hello, Gigi.
- Hey.
Tell Yvonne that the Victors are
gonna seize the V.I.P. table.
Bring over some beer.
If our beer don't kill you,
it'll sure make you piss
stronger.
I got the cowboy.
# Now you've gone and cut
a whole new deal #
# And it don't matter
how I feel #
# Hell's bells... #
Come on, bitch!
Hi, Gent.
How many of these horny little
devils you bang anyway?
Yvonne, you snuck up
on me, didn't you?
Gentlemen, this is Yvonne,
the future Mrs. Gent.
We won't be shopping for
furniture anytime soon.
What happened?
You introduced Gigi as the
future Mrs. Gent last month.
I forgot.
To the next Mrs. Gent.
Oh, and when you're done,
come to my office.
We're having a private party.
I'm fuckin' there!
Right now!
- These guys are animals.
- Why do we gotta wait?
You're out!
Pistolero kept his word.
He made a vow
to the three B's:
Bikes, Beer, and Booty.
We could be rich, man,
you know?
I'm talking about four B's:
Bikes, Beer, Booty,
and Big Bucks, man!
That's actually
fuckin' five B's.
There's a lot of dough
to be had out there.
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,
they're the fuckin' future.
Pistolero...
he needs to be ousted.
All I know
is I'd battle Satan
for Pistol.
A little fuckin' redundant,
don't you think?
You know what?
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
Fuck both you guys.
I'm headed in there right now
and fuckin' wrestle
with those bitches!
Hey!
Well, fuck it. If I have to
help him I have to help.
- Come on in.
- Oh, man!
Shit! Yeah.
Where's all them
oily pussies at?
The oily bird
gets the worm.
Meet me in Tucson
tomorrow at 6:00,
Dani's Inferno.
Ladies are not welcome
except on ladies' night.
We got a sit-down
with the Sixers.
Well, the fuckin' Sixers
ain't here.
This better not be one
long ride for nothing.
I gotta take a piss.
Where's your head?
The ladies room is closed
except for ladies' night.
Now you got a.38
pointed at your head.
You give me your colors,
you little pisser,
or there's gonna be one
unvictorious Victor.
What are you gonna do
with these eight other
little pissers when I don't?
I'm gonna wine 'em
and dine 'em.
I'm gonna show them Paris.
You ought to see how
I'm gonna buy them off.
You know,
you have to accept
the fact that
the brotherhood of bikers
is bullshit.
The three B's:
Bikers, Brotherhood, Bullshit.
Do you ever do anything
but yack?
You half-witty piss-poor
shit-wit nitwit?
Take us to the fuckin' Sixers!
Sure thing, man.
Come on, no probleme.
How long have you
had that bike?
Since 1976.
Follow me if you can!
He's fucking with us, man.
Relax. I know this desert
like the back of my hand.
You just keep me
in sight.
This guy's a fucking clown.
Listen to me. We catch
that old motherfucker,
let's whack that Injun
motherfucker too.
We don't need him no more.
I know whose side I'm on.
The Deuce.
Fuckin' copacetic by me.
I'm with you, man.
The Deuce, the Six-Six-Sixers,
Billy Wings!
Ladies shouldn't ride Indians
except on ladies' night!
Now put your balls on ice.
Let me get some info
out of him first,
before we send him to
the Happy Hunting Grounds.
I hope you got
insurance, old man.
Be cool, Sonny Boy.
Greetings
from Pistolero!
Nobody said nothing to me about
nobody pissing on my boots!
And I'm gonna tell
Johnny Pissed-Off
that I'm lots more
pissed off than him.
Comanche, meet Eddie Zero.
Now gimme a hand with this,
'cause I got things to go
and places to do. Come on.
# If you can dream #
# Dream of Maria #
# If you can love, #
# Then love Maria #
# She'll be the one #
# Who'll come to you #
# When sunset turns #
# To morning dew. #
Perfect.
Don't say that.
The day that it's perfect
is your last day on earth.
Hell is gonna get a hell of a
lot worse from this point on.
I think I finally found
Cherokee Kisum's boy.
The ones who killed Cherokee
Kisum killed St. Louie too.
The Gent.
That's me.
Pistolero would like to chat
with you and Comanche.
Well thanks for the latest
breaking news, Wolf Blitzer.
Dani's Inferno at 6:00.
You stay off
the main highways.
The Sixers are
cruising around.
Listen, it's
dangerous as hell out here.
How are you doing
weaponry-wise?
What, are you some kind of
bike-to-bike salesman?
I'm Eddie Zero, man.
I thought Eddie Zero got killed
in a big-rig crash in '86.
Yeah, I wish.
Tell Pistolero that I need
to have a chat with him
before the other chat
about this asshole habit of
him concealing shit from me.
Tell him your
fuckin' self, man.
# She got the love
and admiration #
# Of the Brotherhood Society #
# Of South Napa County,
yeah #
# She got the love
and admiration #
# Of the Brotherhood Society #
# Of South Napa County,
yeah... #
My pussy's on fire!
Your thoughtfulness
has given me the burning bush.
Glad to have the fire marshal
arrive on the scene.
Extinguish the fire,
Mr. Fire Chief.
How 'bout we get that
fire hose out?
Fire drill.
Mmm.
Fireplug me.
First the fire chief takes
a ride into the desert.
Then I put out the fire.
What kind of
fire department is this?
Fire resistant.
Fire retardant
if you ask me.
You ain't the only
fire truck in town.
Maybe I got
fire insurance.
That kind of talk won't
get you anywhere with me.
I'm fireproof.
Did you bring the peyote?
I got some thinking to do.
Here's a little
reading material.
That's a lot of trees, baby.
666 pages.
Maybe when I get back,
your fire boy might do a little
professional fire eating.
Now you're talking,
Mr. Fire Boy.
I know you'll keep
your word, baby.
Safe keep the treasure
for my boy.
Portable Pistolero!
Your asshole behavior
looks good all written down.
It's existential
but sexy.
It's sexistential.
And it's not just
the peyote talking.
Let's get
the fireworks started.
I gotta be
moving on.
It's done... finito.
Do whatever you want
with it when I'm dead.
It's your annuity.
Now I want you
to drop those pants,
sit back, relax
and watch my tongue
fight fire with fire.
Can we have a little
fireside chat
after you're done
tonguing me?
How's about we have
the little fireside chat
while I'm
tonguing you?
We'll kill two birds
with one tongue.
Are you 86-ing me?
You're not a pussy eater.
You never ate my pussy,
not once.
Why all of a sudden?
Nobody dumps me.
I'm the one that does
the 86-ing!
You fucking need to get
that Cherokee Kisum
out of your gut
once and for all!
Oh, Jesus!
Puta madre.
Bury me
near St. Louie
at the cactus flower.
Safe keep the treasure
for the boy.
Can I get you
anything, Deuce?
No no.
# I'm going traveling #

You must be The Gent.
What tipped you off,
the outfit?
I'm known as Dani
around these parts.
I'm a friend
of Pistolero's.
Is that a fact?
Kind of a dangerous thing
to be nowadays, isn't it?
What's your pleasure,
booze wise?
What's your nationality?
Born in the U.S. of A.
I'm part Irish,
part Italian,
part Arapaho.
I'm an Irishian-hoe.
I must say,
God bless America.
And God damn it,
I'll have an American beer.
You got it.
What a country.
Thank you.
What should we drink to?
Christopher Columbus.
To Amerigo Vespucci.
Hey!
Why'd you fly the coop?
That wasn't part
of the fucking plan.
We were supposed to talk
to Pistolero together
after he got done
fucking.
It would be a whole lot
easier to explain
of you didn't have that gun
pointed at my face.
My life used to be
a bike-and-booty epic.
Because of you
and Pistolero
it's turned into a goddamn whopper
of a chopper opera.
Well, if you'd like,
I can turn your life
into an operetta.
Why'd you hit me
with that bottle?
How many of these
do you got?
Just one.
And I just
used it up.
Yes, you did, son.
Open a beer.
What do you got?
What do you want?
Around here
we drink
American beer.
American it is then.
I want to make a suggestion
where you can stick all your sticks.
Nobody's gonna
stop you.
What the fuck?
Implementing a plan
to save the day?
All you've been doing
is running around
collecting girls' phone numbers.
Come on, motherfucker!
Go easy.
Apache uprising.
A medicine woman
saved my life
after she
almost killed me.
- Beer?
- Yeah.
All right.
Which asshole
are you betting on?
I'm betting
you're a bigger asshole
than the two of them
put together.
I'll drink to that.
To the President
of Assholes.
It took me years
to figure out
if you were a good guy
or a bad guy.
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?
It's how come
I'm the pres.
I'm gonna kill
the two of you
as soon as you
wear yourselves out
a little bit more.
Rope-a-dopes.
Hell, my life
used to be
one long biker party.
where all the pussy
was wide open
and the whiskey
was flowing.
Now it seems my life
has turned into
some kind
of a cycle symphony,
a symphony
in 666 movements,
a 666cc
cycle symphony
with no intermezzos...
Shut the fuck up!
What the hell were you
two assholes thinking?
Dani, can I be alone
with my two assholes?
No Victor
does any business
without getting
the go-ahead from me first.
You told us
to never ever bother you
when you were fucking.
I had everything covered.
Infiltrators, rats,
Benedict Arnolds
up the ass.
I had us covered.
You had you covered!
And God damn it,
I rue the day
that I became a Victor.
And I rue the day
that I brought Bix in.
You didn't bring Bix in.
He suckered you
into introducing him
to me.
Nobody likes
to be suckered.
Hey, go easy on him.
- I actually felt that one.
- Good.
We got some serious
hell-fighting to do
with Billy Wings.
You in or out?
Oh, I don't know.
I could go either way.
Which way
is it gonna be?
Eenie meenie
miney moe.
I'm in.
Good.
I'm holding two aces.
I'm holding two aces
and one Deuce.
I'm holding one Deuce
at the Inn 6
off route 66.
I had it covered.
I had it all
fucking covered.
I want you to meet me
at Inn 6, route 66,
tomorrow morning
at 6:00 A.M.
Think you can
remember that?
Are you gonna tell me
six more times?
A child of six
could remember that.
# We all want

Hey, what do those
white wings mean?
They're for licking
virgin pussy.
The red wings
are for licking
a bleeding pussy.
See that?
The blue-and-yellow wings
are for licking
a policewoman.
The blue-and-yellow-
on-brown wings...
they're for licking
a policewoman's asshole.
The green wings are for licking
a pussy with crabs.
The purple wings...
they're for licking
a dead pussy.
See that?
Pill-popping,
cunt-eating,
dope-smoking
motherfucker.
But you know,
in a good way.
Get out of here.
Come here.
Comanche, I want you
to meet Maria.
Hello.
Who the hell are you
and what the fuck is your story?
I'm just a guy
named Comanche,
a Victor
named Comanche.
That's my story.
Do you know anything
about a key?
No.
Tell me about it.
Do you know anything
about a safe-deposit box?
No.
Tell me about it.
Ever heard
of Cherokee Kisum?
I knew a Cherokee Indian
woman once.
The Deuce did too,
from way back.
When they
weren't busy
leading the sexual
revolution
they were busy
producing acid.
They made a fortune
on the L.S.D. market,
then coke.
The only problem was,
she was fucking over The Deuce
while she was fucking him.
And let me tell you
something...
she stashed away
one hell of a mint.
On July 4th, 1976,
she went up in flames.
She had a boy.
No one ever saw that boy
ever again.
How do I know for sure
that you're you?
Stand up.
Hi, Deuce.
How are you?
Hello, Johnny.
It's been
many a moon.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you
for the suite, Johnny.
You know,
I hope I'm not
being unreasonable,
but no mint on the pillow
again last night.
No pillow,
in fact.
You know, Johnny,
mint hoarding
is not good
for business.
The key to a good
business relationship is
everybody's happy.
I'm not happy,
Johnny.
That's a very
nice suit.
Yeah, well,
it used to be
before I was shanghaied
two nights ago.
I thought you got killed
by a big rig back in '86.
I ain't happy,
Johnny.
Well, who is, Deuce?
I mean,
tell me if it's
none of my business,
but I heard you did
a lot of traveling all these years.
That's very true.
Seeing America,
building an empire.
It was right around
the summer of '76,
I think,
when you kind of
86-ed yourself
from the Six-Six-Sixers.
You know, Johnny,
motorcycles are
big business,
big business.
I mean,
books, magazines,
clothing,
customizing shops...
so big that I finally
had to give up
riding bikes
so I could concentrate
on my motorcycle
business.
I traveled all over
the United States...
the Keystone State,
the Treasure State,
the Show-Me State,
setting up businesses.
I decided
to come back here
because...
because I had some
unfinished business.
Boy oh boy,
I don't know,
I tell you, l...
I don't know nothing
about the Keystone State,
the Treasure State
or the Show-Me State.
I don't know.
My business
has always been
just kind of minding
my own business.
So how is business?
It's business
as usual.
Good.
Then can we
get down to business?
Let's cut a deal.
How's this?
I get the Sixers
off your back
and off
The Gent's back
and you give me
whatever you feel
I'm entitled to
for services
rendered
and everybody's happy,
the three key points
of this deal being
that I get deposited
back in L.A.
with my entitlement,
and you and The Gent
get to die old men.
Those would be the three
key points of this deal.
I've had enough of you.
Cut out the double talk.
He doesn't know anything
about a safe-deposit box
or a key.
A key?
What-what-what key
are you talking about?
The key that Cherokee Kisum
had made.
Who's Cherokee Kisum?
Hmm?
Cherokee Kisum was
the young woman
you kept company with.
The young woman
who was set on fire
on July 4th, 1976.
Billy Wings:
Deuce, she's gotta burn.
Nothing, Johnny.
I'm sorry,
I don't have
any recollection
of any of this.
It was quite
a long time ago.
Can you recollect
setting St. Louie on fire
a couple of nights ago?
Huh.
Deuce, I swear
Pistolero never said
a fucking thing
about any
safe-deposit box!
No, Johnny.
No memory of it
at all.
But then I ain't
no Marcel Proust.
You got any proof
of all this?
Do I need
fucking proor?
Well, you must need
something
or I'd be dead already,
wouldn't I?
The only reason
you're not dead is
before I kill you
I wanted to ask Sonny Kisum
if he'd like to cut off your head
before I do it.
Hell, yes.
I've waited
all of these years
to kill him
with you.
I still got business
with Billy Wings.
Partners in crime,
right?
I had Eddie Zero
trying to track down
Sonny Kisum for years.
Maybe you would have
found Sonny Kisum
if your tracker wasn't
a 24-7 hash-head.
No.
No, in my opinion,
you don't find Sonny Kisum
until Sonny Kisum
wants to be found.
I was just about
to say that.
Cherokee Kisum
was one
wild-as-hell woman,
a good woman
but wild.
I gave her my word
if anything happened
to her
I'd safe keep the treasure
for her boy.
Is it being
kept safer
than the safekeeping
of Cherokee Kisum was?
She wasn't looking to me
for safekeeping.
I never knew what happened
the day she died
and couldn't find
anyone who did.
It was a 36-carat-
diamond-studded,
solid gold riddle.
Look, I'm an owl.
Get out of here.
In the basket.
Ain't that Pistolero
one malevolent motherfucker?
Follow me
to Pistolero
if you can
stomach it.
Well now,
the way I see it
I only got close to that treasure
once before
and I ain't gonna let
that motherfucker
fuck it up again
this time.
Let's ride.
Go home.
It'll all amount
to nothing.
Pistolero's coming here.
Don't fuck up.
I need him alive.
Hey, piker biker.
Purple wings.
Can you two stomach
which dead pussy
earned me
my purple wings?
Ain't nothing
you can do to me
I can't stomach.
You ain't seen
nothing yet.
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while.
Give Comanche the two keys
you're holding.
Let him safe keep 'em
for a while, God damn it.
Take a peek at St. Louie.
See if he's resting in peace.
Look for
the cactus flower.
You know, you should
lighten up on yourself.
When you fuck with The Deuce
you're gonna get burned by The Deuce.
I met her before
she met The Deuce.
I first met her
in 1969
through Eddie Zero.
She was 16.
I was 14.
Think about that one.
Hey, you okay?
- Nada?
- Yes, sir.
- Did you bring my jacket?
- Mm-hmm. Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.
So how come
we'd never met before?
- I'm Eddie.
- I know, Eddie.
You ever get tired
of faking your own death?
You got a joint?
I sure do.
Baby.
Hey, Kemo Sabe,
just how much was
in that box for us
from the Cherokee woman?
Us?
Us, yeah, like you and me.
Us, yeah.
I knew it would
come to this... us.
Well, I don't want
nothing from it.
I'm only curious to know
how much is in there.
You're just curious,
but you don't want
nothing from it.
No, I don't.
It's none of our business
what's in the box.
So what you're
saying is
that the booty
in the box
that I've already said
that I don't want nothing from
is none
of my business?
Gent: So let me
get this straight...
the box and the booty
that's in it
which I've already said
that I don't want
nothing of
is none
of my business?
Butt out of the booty business,
in other words.
Well, you're being
downright unfriendly now.
Where's the cash
that Bob The Bum was holding
when he got
his throat slit?
Oh, well,
I'm holding on to that.
I'm keeping it safe
'cause that's
my destiny.
And maybe that's
none of your business.
I think it's my business
to have in my hand right there.
Listen, I don't want
to have to kill you.
I want you
to hand over
Bob The Bum's cash
right now.
Go ahead. Where do you want
to kill me, here?
You want to kill me
between the eyes?
Right between
the eyes, yeah.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Put it right between my fucking eyes.
Come on, go ahead.
You can do it.
Come on.
Eh...
I was counting on you
to do something
to stop this whole
fucking ridiculous thing.
What the hell
made you think
you could count
on me?
What got into your
fucking brain?
Because I love you.
Aw, hell.
You did good, Sonny.
I think I'm gonna
call you son from now on
'cause Sonny's eating up
way too much fucking time.
