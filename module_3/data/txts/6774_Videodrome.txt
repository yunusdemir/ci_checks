Civic TV, the one
<i>you take to bed with you.</i>
<i>Max, it's that time again.</i>
<i>Time to slowly, painfully ease</i>
<i>yourself back into consciousness.</i>
<i>No, I'm not a dream,</i>
<i>although I've been told</i>
<i>I'm a vision of loveliness.</i>
Who told you that?
<i>I'm nothing less than</i>
<i>your faithful girl Friday, Bridey James,</i>
<i>here with your wake-up call of today,</i>
<i>which is Wednesday the 23rd.</i>
<i>You got that? Wednesday the 23rd.</i>
<i>And I have a message.</i>
<i>Remember your meeting this morning at 6:30</i>
<i>with Shinji Kuraki of Hiroshima Video.</i>
<i>This meeting is to take place</i>
<i>at the Classic Hotel, Suite 17.</i>
<i>And needless to say,
it's your first of the day.</i>
<i>Don't you know anyone</i>
<i>who works 9:00 to 5:00?</i>
<i>Over and out, Commander.</i>
Civic TV, the one
<i>you take to bed with you.</i>
- Sweetie, open the door, will you?
- Go away.
Come on. You know I love you.
For fuck's sake, open the door!
I don't wanna open the door.
I wanna get out of this place!
For fuck's sake, open the door!
You know I love you,
you just gotta open the fucking door!
Well, I looked over the stills.
I am interested, a little bit.
How many shows you got?
Thirteen, with a possibility of another six
if the sales go well.
- You got cassettes?
- Of course.
Hold it. Show me the last one.
Number 13.
But, Max, you won't understand anything.
Everything is set up in the first two.
My audience ain't gonna see
the first two shows.
Now, show me the last one.
What do you think?
Can we get away with it?
Do we want to get away with it?
Oriental sex is a natural.
I think it will get us an audience
we never had before.
I don't like it. lt's not tacky enough.
- Tacky enough for what?
- Tacky enough to turn me on.
Too much class. Bad for sex.
Maybe.
I don't know.
It's soft. There's something
too soft about it.
I'm looking for something
that will break through.
Something tough.
- Hey, Harlan. Enough?
- Oh, okay.
Here we go.
It'll come through on that.
We only got about 53 seconds
so keep your eyes open.
They've got an unscrambler scrambler,
if you know what I mean.
It sensed that we were unscrambling
and automatically changed its code on us.
What satellite is it coming from?
- Snooker, I think.
- Country of origin?
Assuming 53 seconds
represents the period of delay,
I'd say somewhere in Malaysia?
Okay, here we go!
This is it.
There's a wall behind her. What is that? Clay?
Yeah. Wet clay.
I think it's electrified.
- That's it?
- That's it.
- Grotesque, as promised.
- Okay.
Can you hang a searcher on it next time it...
Already working on it.
I was pretty insulted when
it just shrugged us off in less than a minute.
Well, patrón,
interested?
Yeah. Harlan, can you do something
about these labels?
This is supposed to be
a clandestine operation.
You know what I mean?
<i>Sí, patrón.</i>
You always find yourself
getting just a little nervous
even if you've been doing it all your life,
don't you think?
Oh, yeah. Oh, for sure.
- Of course, that's part of the excitement of it.
- Mmm-hmm.
Do you smoke?
No, thanks.
Just relax.
And now, here it is,
The Rena King Show.
<i>And this afternoon,</i>
<i>Rena's guests are Max Renn,</i>
<i>controversial president of Channel 83,</i>
<i>radio personality Nicki Brand,</i>
<i>and media prophet Professor Brian O'Blivion.</i>
<i>Take it away, Rena!</i>
Max Renn, your television station
offers its viewers
everything from soft-core pornography
to hard-core violence.
Why?
Well, it's a matter of economics, Rena.
We're small.
In order to survive, we have to give people
something they can't get anywhere else.
And we do that.
But don't you feel such shows contribute to
a social climate of violence
and sexual malaise?
And do you care?
Certainly I care.
I care enough, in fact, to give my viewers
a harmless outlet
for their fantasies and their frustrations.
As far as I'm concerned,
that's a socially positive act.
What about it, Nicki? ls it socially positive?
I think we live in over-stimulated times.
We crave stimulation for its own sake.
We gorge ourselves on it.
We always want more, whether it's tactile,
emotional or sexual.
And I think that's bad.
Then why did you wear that dress?
Sorry?
That dress.
It's very stimulating.
And it's red.
You know what Freud would have
said about that dress?
And he would have been right. I admit it.
I live in a highly excited state
of overstimulation.
Listen, I'd really like
to take you out to dinner tonight.
Professor O'Blivion,
do you think erotic TV shows
and violent TV shows
lead to desensitization?
To dehumanization?
ls the microphone on?
<i>The television screen has become</i>
<i>the retina of the mind's eye.</i>
Yes.
<i>That's why I refuse to appear on television,</i>
<i>except on television.</i>
<i>Of course, "O'Blivion" is not the name</i>
<i>I was born with.</i>
<i>lt's my television name.</i>
<i>Soon, alI of us wilI have special names,</i>
<i>names designed to cause</i>
<i>the cathode ray tube to resonate.</i>
Yes.
Nicki.
ls Max Renn a menace to society?
I'm not sure.
He's certainly a menace to me.
When does the plot
start to unravel here?
Who's this black guy?
ls he a political prisoner?
There's no plot.
It just goes on like that for an hour.
- Goes on like what?
- Like that.
Torture, murder,
mutilation.
- We never leave that room?
- Nope.
- lt's a real sicko.
- lt's brilliant.
- For perverts only.
- lt's absolutely brilliant.
I mean, look,
there's almost no production costs.
You can't take your eyes off it.
It's incredibly realistic.
Where do they get actors who can do this?
- Help me. I think he wants it.
- Come on!
It's worth checking out.
Did you have any trouble
locking on to it this time?
Not after I realized
the Malaysia delay was a plant.
It's not coming from Malaysia?
You cannot fool
the prince of pirates for long.
Harlan, where is it coming from?
Pittsburgh. That's in the USA.
Pittsburgh?
Pittsburgh.
Get professional help.
<i>But it's not me. It's my sister.</i>
<i>lt's not your sister. lt's you, lover.</i>
<i>Can't you telI? Isn't that why you called me?</i>
<i>You want help. You need help.</i>
You're going insane.
I can hear you disintegrating
while you talk to me.
l've got your number, haven't l?
<i>l hate my sister.</i>
<i>l don't want to. lt's ripping me up inside.</i>
<i>But I do. I do.</i>
You call our Distress Center.
Will you call the CRAM Distress Center?
They'll tell you where to get help, lover.
And you need it. You need it now.
<i>l will. I will. Thank you, Nicki.</i>
We'll return
<i>to Nicki Brand</i>
and The Emotional Rescue Show
<i>in just a moment.</i>
<i>This is CRAM in Toronto</i>
<i>and we've got the weather for you.</i>
Got any porno?
- You serious?
- Yeah. Gets me in the mood.
What's this? Videodrome?
Torture. Murder.
Sounds great.
It ain't exactly sex.
Says who?
- God, I can't believe it.
- l'll turn it off.
No, no, no. lt's okay. I can take it.
Can you get it any clearer?
It's a pirate tape. They scrambled it.
I like it.
Yeah?
Yeah, it turns me on.
Take out your Swiss Army knife
and cut me here, just a little.
I'd say somebody's beat me to it.
I wonder how you get to be
a contestant on this show.
I don't know. Nobody ever seems
to come back next week.
What did you say happened
to your shoulder?
A friend. I think he'd like Videodrome.
You let somebody cut you?
Uh-huh.
What do you think?
I don't know.
You wanna try a few things?
Max, thank God. Masha Borowczyk
has been in your office for an hour.
What were you doing last night?
Didn't you get my message?
I don't think I'm ready for this.
Coffee. Cigarette. Office. Masha. Go.
She's hot to trot.
I call it Apollo And Dionysus.
Masha, does it ever get good?
It's all good.
Darling, I am looking for something
a lot more
contemporary.
I want something that's gonna show people
what's really going on under the sheets.
This stuff is too...
It's too naive. lt's too sweet.
Like you, darling.
Well, it's your market.
Do you know a show called Videodrome?
- Video what?
- D-R-O-M-E.
Videodrome. Like video circus, video arena.
- You know it?
- No.
It's just torture and murder.
No plot, no characters. Very, very realistic.
I think it's what's next.
Then God help us.
- Better on TV than on the streets.
- Excuse me.
Arnold on line three.
You interested in tracking it down for me?
I'll see that you get the agent's commission.
I'm interested.
Let me try.
Max.
Did you ever think of producing
your own show?
Right here?
I could be your agent, worldwide.
I could sell subterranean for you everywhere.
No, I don't have the temperament.
But, if you did,
what kind of show would you do?
I mean, for the subterranean market.
Would you do Videodrome?
Max.
Mmm-hmm.
I'm going away tomorrow for two weeks,
on assignment.
Guess where.
LA.
- Pittsburgh.
- Fabulous.
Don't stay in the sun too long.
I heard it's bad for the skin.
Oh, come on.
lsn't that where they make Videodrome?
Yeah. Why?
I'm gonna audition.
I was made for that show.
Nobody on Earth was made for that show.
Hey, listen to me.
- Listen to me.
- What?
I want you to stay away from it!
Those mondo weirdo video guys,
they've got unsavory connections,
they play rough.
Rougher than even Nicki Brand wants to play.
Do you understand me?
Sounds like a challenge.
Got a cigarette?
It's not a challenge.
I swear.
You know, in Brazil, Central America,
those kinds of places,
making underground videos
is considered a subversive act.
They execute people for it.
In Pittsburgh, who knows?
Max.
Nicki, don't!
Nicki, don't.
Do you have a hangover?
I stayed up late watching TV.
You get in touch
with our friend in Pittsburgh?
In a way. At a distance.
- The subterranean grapevine.
- And?
Max, Videodrome is something
for you to leave alone.
It is definitely not for public consumption.
Channel 83 is a little small
to be considered public.
It is still too public. Do you understand me?
No. What is it? What's the punch line?
I think it's dangerous, Max, Videodrome.
What? lt's Mafia? They do business.
No, no, no. lt's more...
How can I say? More political than that.
- Come on, Masha, what are we talking about?
<i>- Videodrome.</i>
What you see on that show, it's for real.
It's not acting.
It's snuff TV.
I don't believe it.
So, don't believe.
Why do it for real?
It's easier and safer to fake it.
Because it has something
that you don't have, Max.
It has a philosophy
and that is what makes it dangerous.
Whose philosophy?
There must be a name.
Give me a name I can talk to.
Masha, Masha, you know me.
I stay away from the scary stuff.
Max, you are going to have
to be nice to me for this.
We can take a shower together,
any time you say.
I'm sure you would be very beautiful
but you're a little older than I prefer.
Thank you
so much.
Sell me a name,
and I'll make Apollo And Dionysus
part of the package.
That hurts me, Max.
Hey, the world's a shit-hole, ain't it?
Yes, Max, it is.
Brian O'Blivion.
That is the only name I have to give.
Professor Brian O'Blivion.
Wait. Where are you going?
Come back here.
Got to have a smoke
with a cup of coffee.
They don't serve coffee in there,
it's piss water.
I don't have to put up with this shit.
Come on, step along.
- Bianca O'Blivion?
- Yes.
I'm Max Renn. I run Civic TV.
I did a panel show with Professor O'Blivion.
<i>- The Rena King Show.</i>
- Oh, yes.
You said some very superficial things.
Violence, sex, imagination, catharsis.
My exact words.
What do you want?
I wanna talk with your father
about a new twist in video
that he may not be aware of.
- l love the view.
- You look like them,
like one of Father's derelicts.
I think it's the style. lt's coming back.
In their case, Mr. Renn, it's not a style.
It's a disease forced on them by
their lack of access to the cathode ray tube.
You think a few doses of TV
are gonna help them?
Watching TV will help patch them back
into the world's mixing board.
Absolutely.
I guess you encourage Father's derelicts
to make home movies
for the world's mixing board.
Professor O'Blivion sends video letters
all over the world.
- ls the Professor here?
- l am my father's screen.
Once you've told me
what this little visit is all about,
he may choose to send you a cassette.
If he does, which format would you like?
If he does,
it's gonna make conversation a little difficult.
My father has not engaged in conversation
for at least 20 years.
The monologue
is his preferred mode of discourse.
Format?
<i>Videodrome.</i>
ls that a Japanese configuration?
- You've never heard of it?
- No.
Then there have been
serious gaps in your education.
<i>Videodrome.</i>
Mention it to your father.
He may want to have a conversation.
I love the view.
<i>Torture, murder, mutilation.</i>
Videodrome.
<i>What you see on that show, it's for real.</i>
I'm gonna audition.
<i>I was made for that show.</i>
<i>It has something</i>
<i>that you don't have, Max.</i>
<i>lt has a philosophy</i>
<i>and that is what makes it dangerous.</i>
Hi. This is your wake-up cassette
and this came to the office
for you by courier.
What did they say at CRAM?
They said that Nicki Brand
is definitely not on assignment for them.
She had a month off coming to her.
She decided to take it now.
Don't touch that!
Jesus, Max. You scared me.
What the hell's wrong with you?
I don't know.
I think I'm getting a rash or something.
What?
Are you all right?
Bridey, I didn't mean to hit you.
Hit me?
You didn't hit me.
No? No, I know I didn't hit you. I mean...
- Do you want me to stay here?
- Uh...
You look awful. Can I get you something?
No. No, I'm just...
I'm...
I'm exhausted.
I was in a deep sleep when you knocked
and I guess I'm still not out of it.
I'll remember to set the timer, don't worry.
- You're sure?
- l'm sure. Thanks, Bridey. Tomorrow.
Max, that other cassette is from
the office of Brian O'Blivion.
I promised I'd hand-deliver it directly to you.
Will you call me if you need me?
<i>The battle for the mind of North America</i>
<i>will be fought in the video arena,</i>
the Videodrome.
<i>The television screen</i>
<i>is the retina of the mind's eye.</i>
<i>Therefore, the television screen is part</i>
<i>of the physical structure of the brain.</i>
<i>Therefore, whatever appears</i>
<i>on the television screen</i>
<i>emerges as raw experience</i>
<i>for those who watch it.</i>
<i>Therefore, television is reality</i>
<i>and reality is less than television.</i>
Max,
<i>I'm so glad you came to me.</i>
<i>I've been through it all myself, you see.</i>
<i>Your reality is already</i>
<i>half video halIucination.</i>
<i>lf you're not careful,</i>
<i>it wilI become total halIucination.</i>
<i>You'II have to learn to live</i>
<i>in a very strange, new world.</i>
<i>I had a brain tumor. And I had visions.</i>
<i>I believe the visions caused the tumor,</i>
<i>and not the reverse.</i>
<i>I couId feel the visions coalesce</i>
<i>and become flesh,</i>
<i>uncontrollable flesh.</i>
<i>But when they removed the tumor,</i>
it was called Videodrome.
I was the...
I was Videodrome's
<i>first victim.</i>
But who's behind it? What do they want?
<i>l want you, Max.</i>
You.
<i>Come to me.</i>
<i>Come to Nicki.</i>
Come on.
<i>Don't make me wait.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>l want you, Max.</i>
You.
Come on.
Come to me now.
<i>Come to Nicki.</i>
<i>Don't keep me waiting. Please.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
Today, Lady Luck
<i>may smile on these four players</i>
<i>and start them on the road to $12,000...</i>
We have a new group of people
coming in this afternoon,
so tell the staff about that.
All right.
Exciting. Very lively.
Careful. lt bites.
- You watched the cassette?
- Yeah.
- And?
- lt changed my life.
I'm not surprised. lt's dangerous, you know.
Because your father admits
he's somehow involved with Videodrome?
More than that. lt bites.
lsn't that what you said?
What kind of teeth do you think it has?
It triggered off a series of hallucinations.
I woke up with a headache.
First time ever?
No, I'd been hallucinating for a while
ever since...
What?
Since I first saw Videodrome.
How did you come to be exposed to it?
A pirate satellite dish. An accident.
I made some tapes...
This is part
of my own Videodrome collection.
But that tape is just your father
sitting at his desk.
The tone of the hallucinations
is determined by
the tone of the tape's imagery.
But the Videodrome signal,
the one that does the damage,
it can be delivered
under a test pattern, anything.
Damage?
The signal induces a brain tumor
in the viewer.
It's the tumor that creates the hallucinations.
You let me watch it?
I expect them to come to me eventually
to hurt me. I thought it might be you.
Now I realize you're just another victim,
like Father was.
Where is your father?
I think I'd better talk to him.
He's in there.
I'm afraid he'll disappoint you.
This is him. This is all that's left.
What are you talking about?
Brian O'Blivion died quietly
on an operating table 11 months ago.
The brain problem?
The Videodrome problem.
You have it, too.
- But he was on that panel show with me.
- On tape.
He made thousands of them,
sometimes three or four a day.
I keep him alive as best I can.
He had so much to offer.
My father helped to create Videodrome.
He saw it as the next phase in the evolution
of man as a technological animal.
When he realized what
his partners were going to use it for,
he tried to take it away from them
and they killed him, quietly.
At the end, he was convinced
that public life on television
was more real than private life in the flesh.
He wasn't afraid to let his body die.
Tell me about my Videodrome problem.
My father knows much more about it
than I do.
Listen to him.
Where's Harlan? He's not in the lab.
- l think he's up in VTR. Max...
- Not now.
- Harlan.
<i>- Sí, patrón?</i>
Have you been hallucinating lately?
No.
Should I be?
Yes, you should be.
<i>l believe that the growth in my head,</i>
<i>this head, this one right here,</i>
<i>l think that it is not really a tumor,</i>
<i>not an uncontrolled,</i>
<i>undirected little bubbling part of flesh,</i>
<i>but that it is, in fact, a new organ,</i>
<i>a new part of the brain.</i>
<i>I think that massive doses</i>
ofVideodrome signal
<i>will ultimately create a new outgrowth</i>
<i>of the human brain,</i>
<i>which will produce and control hallucination</i>
<i>to the point that it will change human reality.</i>
<i>After all, there is nothing real</i>
<i>outside our perception of reality,</i>
<i>is there?</i>
<i>You can see that, can't you?</i>
Max Renn?
Yes. Who is this?
<i>Barry Convex wouId like</i>
to talk to you about Videodrome.
<i>I've got a car waiting downstairs for you, sir.</i>
Please direct your attention
<i>to the television set in front of you, Mr. Renn.</i>
<i>Mr. Convex has recorded</i>
<i>a little introduction for you.</i>
<i>Hi. I'm Barry Convex,</i>
<i>chief of special programmes.</i>
<i>And I'd like to invite you into</i>
<i>the worId of Spectacular Optical,</i>
<i>an enthusiastic global corporate citizen.</i>
<i>We make inexpensive glasses</i>
<i>for the third worId</i>
<i>and missile guidance systems for NATO.</i>
We also make Videodrome, Max.
<i>And as I'm sure you know,</i>
<i>when it's ready for the marketplace,</i>
<i>things will never be quite the same again.</i>
<i>lt can be a giant hallucination machine</i>
<i>and much, much more.</i>
<i>But it's not ready.</i>
<i>Those were test transmissions you picked up.</i>
<i>We thought nobody could tap into them.</i>
He's good, that Harlan. Good pirate.
<i>Well, now that you have,</i>
<i>l think we ought to have a little talk,</i>
<i>don't you?</i>
<i>l thought maybe my place?</i>
I hope you realize
you're playing with dynamite.
That's our spring line. Top-secret stuff.
I brought them with me
for a trade show here in town later this week.
Max Renn, I'm Barry Convex.
I think that machinery you're wearing
is too much for the shape of your face.
Overwhelms you.
Try something more spidery,
more delicate.
Here she is. This is our prototype.
This is the little number that started it all.
Max, I would like you to try this on for size.
I would like to use this machine
to record one of your hallucinations. Now.
Then, I would like to take that tape
back with me to home base for analysis.
Do I get to keep the copyright?
I'd hate to see it show up as
a movie of week and not get paid for it.
Max, I'm trying to help you.
What makes you think I need help, Barry?
None of our test subjects
has returned to normality.
They're all in need of
intensive psychiatric care.
You seem to be functioning
reasonably well so far.
I'd like to find out why.
And I think an analysis
of one of your hallucinations
would be the right place to start.
Will it hurt?
It won't hurt you.
You might catch yourself
sliding in and out of a hallucinatory state
after this is all over.
If you do, just relax and enjoy it.
It will soon go away.
But for now, I think that you will find
a little S and M will be necessary
to trigger off a good,
healthy series of hallucinations.
That's why our Videodrome show
is so strange.
It's something to do with the effects of
exposure to violence on the nervous system.
It opens up receptors
in the brain and the spine
and that allows the Videodrome signal
to sink in.
You mean I'm going to have
to hurt you, Barry?
Afraid not.
You don't have to actually hurt anybody.
You just have to think about it.
That's too bright! I can't take it!
- Yes, I forgot! Sorry. How's that?
- Shit!
Yeah. Yeah, that's fine.
Okay, we're rolling.
The taping mechanism is all self-contained.
You don't have to do anything now
but hallucinate.
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
I'll come back for you later.
You'll forgive me
if I don't stay around to watch?
I just can't cope with freaky stuff.
Nicki?
Nicki.
Well, here we are at last.
Right where we ought to be.
<i>On Videodrome.</i>
<i>What are you waiting for, lover?</i>
<i>Let's perform.</i>
<i>Let's open those neural floodgates.</i>
What's going on, Professor O'Blivion?
I mean, really.
Oh, Masha.
Harlan. lt's Max.
Can you come over to my apartment?
Right away.
Yeah, I'm serious.
Come on in.
Well, here I am, patrón.
Camera. Flashgun. What's up?
You want to be a centerfold?
I want you to go into my bedroom and I want
you to take a look at what's in my bed.
Uncover it. Don't be shy. I want pictures.
- Pictures of what's in your bed?
- Yeah. Do it!
Sure. Okay.
Well?
Max,
I don't see anything.
You didn't just want me to shoot your bed,
pillows, sheets, did you?
Max, are you in some kind of drug warp?
I've got friends who can help.
Bridey said she came by a couple of days ago
and you were...
Did you tape Videodrome last night?
Yeah, if it was transmitted,
the machine would have caught it.
I'll meet you in the lab in one hour.
I want to see it.
Jesus, Max, it's not even 7:00 a.m.
Harlan, I am not just fucking around,
do you understand me?
Well, fuck you. I'm not just some fucking
servomechanism you can switch on and off.
You want me to fall out of bed
and run around like an asshole,
you tell me what I'm doing it for.
Otherwise, I'll see you
during office hours, patrón.
Harlan, you're right.
It's momentum.
I'm running like an express train here.
I don't know how to stop.
Look, I'll meet you in the lab
in one hour, okay?
And then we'll see if
we pulled in any Videodrome last night
and I'll tell you what's going on. Everything.
I promise. Okay?
Okay. Sorry I freaked out on you, patrón.
- l don't work with you for the money.
- l know that.
With pirates,
it's never just for the money, is it?
You want a cup of coffee? No.
I'll meet you in the lab in an hour.
Come on in.
Did you look at the tape?
Did you see me on Videodrome?
There was no tape.
There was no Videodrome transmission
last night?
Not last night.
Aw, fuck.
Not ever.
What are you talking about?
I'm out of my depths now, patrón.
I had to bring in the reinforcements.
Max.
An intriguing combination. Very interesting.
Don't let me interrupt.
I think I was saying something like,
"What are you talking about?"
I was playing you tapes, Max.
Prerecorded cassettes.
Videodrome has never been transmitted
on an open broadcast circuit.
Not yet.
I guess Barry sent you here, what,
two years ago?
It has been two years, hasn't it, Harlan?
Two. Two wonderful years.
Why?
To get you involved.
Expose you to the Videodrome signal.
It didn't affect you
because you never watched it!
You knew what was there.
You didn't have to see it.
It really does work on just about anybody.
Anybody who watches it, Max.
But why would anybody watch it?
Why would anybody watch
a scum show like Videodrome?
Why did you watch it, Max?
Business reasons.
Sure. Sure.
What about the other reasons?
Why deny you get your kicks
out of watching torture and murder?
You murdered Brian O'Blivion, didn't you,
you freak?
Did you enjoy that?
North America is getting soft, patrón,
and the rest of the world is getting tough.
Very, very tough.
We're entering savage new times
and we're going to have to be pure,
and direct, and strong
if we're going to survive them.
Now, you and this
cesspool you call a television station,
and your people who wallow around in it,
and your viewers who watch you do it,
you're rotting us away from the inside.
We intend to stop that rot.
We're going to start with Channel 83, Max.
We're gonna use it for our first
authentic transmissions of Videodrome.
I have a hunch it's going to be
very popular for a while.
I've got to be hallucinating now, right?
I mean...
You two can't possibly be for real.
We did record your hallucinations, Max,
as I said we would.
And we did analyze them.
You're ready for something new.
That's terrific.
What do you... What do you want from me?
I want you to open up, Max.
Open up to me.
I've got something I wanna play for you.
Oh, my God!
We want Channel 83, Max.
<i>Give it to us. Give us Channel 83.</i>
<i>Kill your partners. Kill them.</i>
<i>KilI your partners and give us Channel 83.</i>
<i>Give us Channel 83.</i>
<i>Kill your partners. Kill them.</i>
<i>KilI your partners and give us Channel 83.</i>
Hello, Max.
How you doing, Max?
Where's Moses?
He's in a meeting with Rafe.
I'll tell him you want him.
Don't.
Dub in a funny track, gentle comedy.
- Mmm-hmm.
- And you'd be the one to write it?
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
I used to write in high school.
I haven't lost it.
Hi, Max.
Just in time to throw some light
on an interesting problem.
Don't!
Max.
What the fuck?
- Max, what happened? Are you hurt?
- They killed us.
- What happened?
- They killed us!
What happened?
Jesus! Look out!
In here. ln here!
Get out! Just clear out of here! Get out!
Let me see.
Max!
Max?
Kill Bianca O'Blivion.
<i>She knows too much.</i>
<i>She can hurt us. Don't let her hurt us, Max.</i>
<i>KilI her. KilI Bianca O'Blivion.</i>
Bianca O'Blivion.
I run Civic TV.
I was on a talk show with your father.
So, it was to be you, after all.
You've come to kill me.
No.
No. I'm Max Renn. I run Civic TV. I don't...
I don't kill people.
Oh, but you do.
You're an assassin now, for Videodrome.
They can program you,
play you like a videotape recorder.
They can make you do what they want.
They want you to destroy
whatever is left of Brian O'Blivion.
They want you to destroy me.
Destroy you?
They killed her, Max. They killed Nicki Brand.
She died on Videodrome.
They used her image to seduce you
but she was already dead.
Don't back away.
I stole it from them just for you to see.
Videodrome is death.
That's better.
So much better.
It's always painful to remove the cassette
and change the program.
But, now that we have,
you'll see that you've become something
quite different from what you were.
You've become the video word made flesh.
I am the video word made flesh.
And now that you are
the video word made flesh,
you know what you have to do.
You turn against Videodrome.
You use the weapons they've given you
to destroy them.
Death to Videodrome.
Long live the new flesh.
Death to Videodrome.
Long live the new flesh.
lt was only 26 hours ago,
<i>in the building you see behind me,</i>
<i>that a bizarre,</i>
<i>apparently motiveless shooting occurred,</i>
<i>which has triggered off</i>
<i>an intensive manhunt by Metro Police.</i>
<i>Thirty-four-year-old Max Renn,</i>
<i>president of the Civic TV Corporation</i>
<i>is being sought in connection</i>
<i>with the shooting deaths</i>
<i>of two executives at Channel 83...</i>
You want to see the monkey dance,
you pay the piper.
See what I'm saying, Teddy?
You know how much
my monkey's batteries cost?
They don't last in the cold.
The cold knocks them right out.
I can't dance.
You know, I would if I could but I can't,
so you got some change, Teddy?
You got something? Half a buck? A quarter?
You got something, Teddy.
Can't you just put a little something in,
Teddy?
What's going on, sport?
They call me Brolley.
How can I help you, sir?
Just looking.
Yeah, man. That's a good one.
There ain't much to see here but
take your time and have a good look anyway.
What is?
This is one hell of a 'scrip you got here.
Very tricky grind.
Can't imagine you'd see things
too clear without them, you know?
But don't worry at all.
I'm gonna get you fixed up in no time flat.
Where's Convex?
Setting up his trade show.
- Got to introduce the spring line.
- What's in the box?
Your head.
l got your head in this box.
You've been busy, Max.
I've been reading about you in the papers.
- Have you seen Bianca O'Blivion?
- l saw her.
- And she give you any trouble?
- No.
That's good.
Maybe you'd like to visit somebody else now.
ls that why you're here?
Maybe.
You've been very useful to us, Max.
We'd like to keep using you
until you're all gone.
Open up to me.
I got something I wanna play for you.
See you in Pittsburgh.
Tracy, come back here. Stay with Mommy.
I wanna see. I wanna see it, Mom. Come on.
Come on, we're going home now.
<i>Well, you know me.</i>
Yeah, we know you!
<i>And I sure know you. Every one!</i>
<i>We're here to celebrate the arrival</i>
<i>of our Spring Collection,</i>
<i>the Medici line.</i>
<i>And our theme for this year</i>
<i>is based on two quotes</i>
<i>from the famous Renaissance statesman</i>
<i>and patron of the arts</i>
<i>Lorenzo de' Medici.</i>
<i>"Love comes in at the eye,"</i>
<i>and "The eye is the window of the soul."</i>
<i>l think that even Pete ought to be able to</i>
<i>selI the helI out of</i>
<i>a classy campaign like that!</i>
Oh, God!
No!
Death to Videodrome!
<i>Long live the new flesh!</i>
I was hoping you'd be back.
<i>I'm here to guide you, Max.</i>
<i>I've learned a lot since I last saw you.</i>
<i>I've learned that death is not the end.</i>
<i>l can help you.</i>
I don't know where I am now.
I'm having trouble finding my way around.
<i>That's because you've gone just about</i>
<i>as far as you can with the way things are.</i>
Videodrome still exists.
<i>lt's very big, very complex.</i>
<i>You've hurt them,</i>
<i>but you haven't destroyed them.</i>
To do that,
<i>you have to go on to the next phase.</i>
What phase is that?
<i>Your body has already</i>
<i>done a lot of changing,</i>
<i>but that's only the beginning.</i>
<i>The beginning of the new flesh.</i>
<i>You have to go all the way now.</i>
<i>Total transformation.</i>
<i>Do you think you're ready?</i>
I guess I am.
How do we do it?
<i>To become the new flesh,</i>
<i>you first have to kill the old flesh.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid to let your body die.</i>
<i>Just come to me, Max. Come to Nicki.</i>
<i>Watch. I'll show you how. lt's easy.</i>
<i>Long live the new flesh.</i>
Long live the new flesh.
