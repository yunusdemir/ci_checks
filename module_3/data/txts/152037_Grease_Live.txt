Danny, I don't want the summer to be over.
I may never see you again.
Sandy, don't talk that way.
But it's true.
I've just had the best summer of my life
and now I have to go back to salt lake.
It isn't fair.
Danny, don't spoil it!
It's not spoiling it.
It's only making it better.
Is this the end?
Don't think about that.
Just be here in the moment.
All that matters is what's
happening right now.

Hey Doody!
Hey, Kenickie!
Where were you all summer?
I was working.
Which is more than any of you
skids can say.
Working?
I got a job lugging boxes at
bargain city.
That's good practice for
after you graduate.
Eat me.
I've been saving up for a new
set of wheels.
You got them yet?
I'm picking them up next week.
Put a little spit shine on it, and Leo
and the scorpions are gonna eat my dust.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hi.
Hey.
How you been, uh...
Cindy.
Right.
We had chemistry together
last year.
I'm sure we did.
Well, maybe this year you could
give me a hand with my biology.
Yes, sure.
Hey, Zuko!
Zuko!
You got the dance card?
All the same chicks as last
year.
What did you do for vacation? We didn't
see you around the neighborhood.
I was down at the beach,
life-guarding and whatnot.
Must be tough with all those
chicks hanging around you.
Only thing that hangs around
Sonny are the flies.
You ever going to learn to
play that thing?
I've been practicing. I already
know three chords. You wanna hear?
No.
Tell us about the action down
at the beach.
It was flipping.
Was it crazy?
I did meet this one chick.
She was... she was sort of cool.
You mean she puts out?
Is that all you ever think
about?
I thought that's all any of
us think about. Grow up.
What's with you?
Nothing.
Hey, what you got there, Eugene?
Give that back!
That's my rocket club poster!
Yeah? Maybe we can send you into
space instead of them monkeys.
Space is the next frontier!
For you, puberty's the next
frontier.
Here.
Now beat it.
Get out of here.
Geez, every teacher I got this year's
already flunked me at least once.
You better be careful.
You spend all your time in
McGee's office.
No way.
I'm not taking any of her crap
this time.
Oh, yeah?
This year, I'm gonna make that old
broad wish she'd never seen me.
That's what I wished for last
year.
Now why don't you be a doll, Sonny, and
make an old broad's dreams come true?
I've got 17 years to retirement and I'd
love to see you leave Rydell before I do.
Look, principal McGee... aren't you
supposed to be in homeroom, Mr. Latierre?
This is no way to start a new
semester.
No ma'am.
Well, are you just going to stand
there all day? Yes, ma'am.
I mean, no, ma'am.
So, move!
I'm sure glad you didn't take
any of her crap, Sonny.
Shut up!
Girls!
Homeroom now.
You, too, miss Rizzo.
Just trying to start our senior
year off right, principal McGee.
Mm-hmm.
Because this year, we're
gonna rule the school.
Ew, jan.
Twinkies are so adolescent.
We are adolescent.
We don't have to flaunt it.
Okay, girls.
Let's go get them.
Hello, ladies.
Hey, jan.
That looks good.
See?
You have an okay summer, Marty?
Oh, you know.
Some cocktail parties, some
travel.
You call a week at a trailer
park "travel?"
We had our own shower.
Looking good today, Rizzo.
Thanks, Nickie.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Zuke.
Rizz.
Come on, guys.
Let's go, ladies.
Oh, fudge!
Am I late?
Am I going to get in trouble?
I didn't know where to catch the
bus so I ended up walking.
I'm from Utah.
That's a heck of a walk.
We just moved here.
Oh, here, let me help you.
I'm Sandy, by the way.
Frenchy.
Welcome to Rydell.
Thanks.
Do you know where room 207 is?
207? Hey, we got
homeroom together!
Mr. Griggs.
Is he nice?
Yeah.
He teaches health class.
But mostly he just sits in the
corner and smokes.
I have a feeling I'm not in
salt lake anymore.
Good morning, boys and girls,
and welcome to Rydell.
I'm not sure yet if this year's seniors will be the best
class of the decade, but at least you'll be the last.
So let's start off the class of
1959's final year on a high note.
♪ as I go traveling down life's
highway ♪
♪ whatever course my fortunes
may foretell ♪
♪ I shall not go alone on my way for
thou shall always be with me Rydell ♪
Now, a few short announcements.
We have a new rocket club starting up for our space
enthusiasts, led by our own Eugene FELSNICK.
And speaking of explosives, the school
district has decided this year to suspend
our duck-and-cover exercises at the high school level
since most of you are too big to fit under the desks.
But please note we're actively looking for a place to build
a new bomb shelter with enough room for almost everyone.
Next Friday will be our first pep rally, and
everyone knows you can't have pep without cheer.
So don't forget to sign up
for cheerleading, girls,
unless of course you've had
a previous head injury.
I want to see plenty of support for
coach Calhoun and the Rydell rangers.
Remember, if you can't be an
athlete, be an athletic supporter.
And finally, the national bandstand television show is
considering Rydell as a representative American high
school to broadcast live from
our gym.
If chosen, we will have the chance to show the entire
nation what bright, clean-cut, wholesome students
we have here at Rydell.
Good luck to us all.
♪ Through all the years Rydell
and tears Rydell ♪
♪ we give three
cheers Rydell for thee ♪
♪ through everything Rydell we cling
Rydell and sing Rydell to thee ♪
That was a nice tight cutoff.
Thank you, Reginald.
Hey, did you guys get a look
at Zuko this morning?
Looking pretty good this year,
huh, Rizz?
That's ancient history.
You never know.
Sometimes history repeats
itself.
Hey, guys!
Hey French.
This here is Sandy young.
Hi.
Have a seat, honey.
This is Marty, and that's jan
and Rizzo.
Sandy just moved here all the
way from salt lake city, Utah.
Oh, salt lake, huh?
That means you're one
of those, uh... skiers.
Well, it's all downhill from
here.
Hey Marty, those new glasses?
Yeah, I got them just for
school.
Don't you think they make me
look smarter?
Sure, till you open your mouth.
How'd you like a fruit
cocktail down your bra?
I'll take it!
The corn syrup is full of
vitamins.
Hi, kids!
It's Patty Simcox, the bad
seed of Rydell.
Hi!
I just love the first day of
school, don't you?
It's the biggest thrill of my
life.
They just announced this year's nominees for student
council, and guess who's up for vice president?
Who?
Me!
Isn't it the most, to say the
least?
The very least.
I just hope I don't make too
poor a showing.
Are we still talking about this?
Oh.
You must think I'm the rudest and the crudest
for not introducing myself to your friend.
Hi! I'm Patty Simcox.
Welcome to ry... ah!
It's a McIn-tush.
Anyway, I hope you'll be at
cheerleader tryouts.
We'll have so much fun and get
to be lifelong friends.
Have you ever cheered before?
A little, back home.
I might remember a few routines.
Well, I'm cheer captain for the past
two years, plus all-state gymnastics.
But hey, you can't have a pyramid
without the people on the bottom.
What's your schedule?
You guys, how do you like Sandy?
You think we could let her in
the pink ladies?
She looks too pure to be ping.
What do you think?
You guys going out for football
this year?
With Tom Chisum as captain?
You kidding?
You guys see that hot chick
at registration?
Sure beats the foam-domes
around here.
You mean her jugs are bigger
than Annette's?
Nobody's jugs are bigger than
Annette's.
Hey, I want to hear what
Danny did down at the beach.
It was nothing.
Sure. Nothing, Zuko.
Come on.
You got in her drawers, right?
Come on, tell us about that
girl.
What'd you do this summer,
Sandy?
Oh, I spent most of it at the
beach.
I met a boy there.
Hauled your cookies all the
way to the beach for some guy?
He was sort of special.
There ain't no such thing.
Oh, you haven't met this boy.
It was really romantic.
You guys really want to hear
all the horny details?
Are you kidding me?
All right, all right, all right.

I wonder how many spots they
have on the squad.
I'm sure there's plenty of
room for you, candy cane.
I keep thinking about that
boy you told us about.
He sounds so nice.
Yeah, real marriage material.
Like rock Hudson.
True love.
True love and he didn't lay a
hand on you?
He sounds like a creep.
He was a gentleman.
Then he wasn't from around here.
All the Rydell boys are so
immature.
No class.
Hey, four-eyes!
Stuff it, dirt bag!
So what was your guy's name,
anyway?
Danny.
Danny Zuko.
That's a nice name.
And did you ever get around to asking
where this Danny Zuko goes to school?
He goes to a fancy boarding
school.
He's an honors student.
Imagine that.
I know. It's like he was
too good to be true.
Well, I think he sounds
peachy-keen.
And you never know, maybe prince charming
will show up again, somewhere unexpected.
Knock 'em dead.
Come on, girls.
But Rizz...
When the time is right.
You think she's right, Frenchy?
About what?
Seeing Danny again.
I feel like he was really the
one.
Anything's possible.
But hey, remember, life doesn't
revolve around men.
We girls got to be our own
people.
Like they tell us in home ec.
Stop!
Vandal!
You're supposed to be at
cheerleading tryouts.
That's not till 3:00.
It's 2:57.
What do you think you're doing?
I need space for my rocket
club poster.
Back away before I call the
authorities.
I have to get my message across.
But people are sick of it.
Clearly you know nothing
about politics.
What if I deliver the
unpopular vote?
Please.
Why do I need votes from losers?
Because we're the majority.
I'll give you from there over.
Thank you.
This never happened.
Good afternoon, boys and girls.
Here's a quick announcement that tryouts for this
year's cheerleading squad are about to begin.
We all know nothing makes a cheerleader
more nervous than when she's late.
Coach Calhoun has advised me that some of you
may be asked to attempt a pyramid formation.
So ladies, please, put safety first
and wear appropriate undergarments.
Remember, your future hangs in
the balance.
Ready, okay!
Go, go, go Rydell!
Go, go, go Rydell!
Tell every team in town can take a hike and
go to hell-o, hello, hello to victory!
Candidates, please observe.
Ready.
Okay.
With a "v," with an "I," with
a "v-i-c."
With a "t," with an "o," with a
"t-o-r."
With an "o," with an "r," with
an "o-r-y."
Victory, victory, Rydell high!
How come we never tried out
for cheerleading?
I prefer to do my screaming
in private.
I read in McCall's that men really respect
cheerleaders, almost as much as secretaries.
See?
Easy, right?
Okay, who's ready to try out?
Come on, don't be shy.
Let's see.
How about...
Sandy young?
Get up here, you.
All right.
Everyone, this is Sandy.
Sandy is new to Rydell so we can't expect her to know all our
routines by heart, but she's going to give it her best shot,
right, Sandy?
I'll try.
Oh, you poor thing.
Okay.
Watch this.
Mr. conductor, if you please.
high "v," low
"v," clap clap clap.
Prep, swing, kick, slap!
You think you can handle that?
I hope so.
Great. Hit it!
high "v," low
"v," clap clap clap.
Prep, swing, kick, slap!
Not bad.
Okay. Let's try something a teensy-weensy
bit more complicated, okay?
Sure.
Mr. conductor, if you please.
And... finish!
And... finish!
Am I all done?
Nope.
You definitely have some basic skills, but
you need more than that to make this squad.
Are you familiar with the middle section of the northern
spirit cheer as performed in last year's national cheer meet,
junior division?
I think I know that one.
Probably a simpler version.
Mr. conductor, if you please!
That's the spirit.
That's the spirit.
Settle.
Now settle.
Settle.
Let's settle, please.
Boys and girls, welcome to the
Rydell rangers pep rally!
Settle, settle.
Now boys and girls, I give you
the man of the hour.
The man who, after seven seasons coaching the football team,
is uniquely qualified to pull the Rydell rangers out of their
seven season slump.
Our very own, coach Calhoun!
Who's the best?
Rydell!
Give 'em hell, Rydell!
Oh.
Sorry, ladies.
We have a banner year coming up.
I'll tell you what I told my
boys.
We may not have size, speed, or skill on our side,
but after seven years, we have something better.
You know what that is?
What?!
The law of averages.
Give a hop, give a yell, lose
your top for old Rydell!
Hey, guys.
Be cool.
You heard the man, we're cool.
Pep ain't cool.
Kenickie's late, let's go in.
Fellas, I'm up to four chords.
You want to hear?
- No!
Hey, guys, here comes Kenickie!
So what do you think?
What a hunk of junk.
Wait till I give it a paint
job and soup up the engine.
She's gonna run like a champ,
and I'm gonna race her.
What? This jalopy?
You are cruising for a bruising.
You watch.
I'm going to race her at thunder
road.
I wouldn't race that thing in
my grandma's driveway.
What're you scorpions doing
here anyway?
This here's our turf.
Not for long, if you plan to hold it
down with a beat-up tin can like that.
If my friend here says he's going to race
thunder road, he'll race thunder road.
That's right.
Okay. You just tell me when.
In the meantime, I wouldn't work on this thing indoors,
because clearly the fumes is already getting to your head.
Oh, yeah?
Come on, fellas.
Nick, let's go in.
I want to check out this year's
assortment of pom-poms.
They're all the same.
Not when you shake 'em.
So, in conclusion, I want you
all to remember this.
Out on that field all that
matters is who wants it more.
And here at Rydell, we want it!
We've never had it, so we really
want it!
And when we finally get it, we're going to
come back here and ring that victory bell.
Ring that victory
where the hell is the bell?
We think that maybe someone
stole it. It's been so long.
Go rangers!
What was he talking about?
I have no idea.
You're pretty.
Thank you.
You are, too.
Thank you.
I'm having a sleepover tonight.
You want to come?
- Sure.
Oh, except I got... what,
your folks won't let ya?
They are pretty strict.
It's not like there's boys
there or anything.
It's going to be a kind of
initiation.
You mean to be a pink lady?
Maybe, we'll see.
Oh, wow. I'll figure something
out. When should I get there?
8:30.
Or is that past your bedtime?
No, on Fridays it isn't till
10:00.
I still don't know about this.
You're just sore about Danny.
That true?
Please.
As a matter of fact... oh,
Sandy?
What are you doing?
The time is right.
Yeah, Rizz?
We got a little surprise for
you.
Follow me.
Okay. So you with me here
or what?
You got vision, my friend.
You know, if we fix up that
car, it could be make-out city.
Right.
A chick is gonna have to put out
before she even gets in!
Hey, Zuke!
Rizz.
What do you want?
I got a surprise for you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.
Sandy?!
Danny?
What are you doing here?
I thought you had to go back to
Utah.
We had a change of plans!
What happened to your boarding
school?
Oh, I just, I didn't want you
to...
I didn't want no ties, you know
what I'm sayin?
I mean, you know how it is,
rockin' and rollin' and whatnot.
Danny?
That's my name, don't wear it
out.
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me, baby?
What's the matter with you?
What happened to the Danny
Zuko I met at the beach?
I don't know. Maybe
there's two of us.
Why don't you take out a missing persons
ad, try the yellow pages, I don't know.
You lied to me?
You're a fake and a phony and I
wish I'd never laid eyes on you!
Bet that's not all she laid
on you.
You happy, Rizz?
Yeah, come to think of it.
Girls.
Hey, let's chip in for a six-pack.
I swiped my brother's I.D.
Danny, you coming or what?
Yeah.
Come on, Sandy, it's not as bad
as all that.
Yes, it is.
Men are rats.
Worse. They're fleas on rats.
They're amoebas on fleas on
rats.
They are too low for even dogs
to bite.
The only man a girl can depend
on is her daddy.
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
See you tonight.
Okay.
Hey Zuko, whats the matter?
Nothing. I'll catch up with you
in a minute.

I feel like I'm ready to live up
to my full potential, you know?
Do something to really make a
difference in the world.
So I applied to beauty school.
You're dropping out of Rydell?
I don't look at it as
dropping out.
I look at it as a very strategic
career move.
Say hello to a future graduate
of la-Cafury beauty academy!
I think this calls for a toast.
How about a little sneaky Pete

It's Italian Swiss colony.
Wow, it's imported.
Who wants a twinkie?
I read how a twinkie or two before bed fires up your
metabolism so you burn calories while you sleep!
Twinkies and wine?
That's real class, jan.
It says right here it's a
dessert wine.
Don't forget about Sandy.
No, I'm okay. Thanks.
You don't drink?
I had some sparkling cider at
my cousin's wedding once.
Ring-a-ding-ding.
Bet you don't smoke, either.
Nope.
How about at least you let me
Pierce your ears, huh?
It'll be good practice.
Practice?
What's the matter, you afraid?
No.
Here, I want to use my virgin
pin?
Nice to know it's good for

Frenchy, I really don't think
it's a good idea.
My mom and...
Oooow!
Why don't we go into the
bathroom?
My mother'll kill me if I get
blood all over the carpet.
Blood?
It only bleeds for a second.
Frenchy, I don't feel very good.
Don't worry Sandy, if she screws up, she can
always fix your hair so your ears don't show.
Would one of you get me some
ice to numb her earlobes?
Why don't you run cold water and
stick her ear under the faucet?
Oh.
Hey, I heard Putzie say the
t-birds might swing by tonight.
How do they know we're even
here?
Did you tell them we're having a
sleepover, Rizz?
Kenickie might have asked
what I was up to.
Since when have you had the
hots for Kenickie?
Sometimes you want a guy who's willing
to put up or shut up, you know?
Sandy's sick.
I did one ear and she saw the
blood and...
You're not getting your hands
on my ears.
You think I ought to call her
folks?
What'd I tell you guys?
Forget pink, she can't even
handle off-white.
You okay in there, Sandy?
I got your toothbrush.
Thanks, French. I'm sorry
to be such a bother.
No, that's okay.
Can you believe her?
Miss goody two-shoes makes me
want to barf.

So you going to talk to her

I changed my mind.
I don't want to be here.
Let's get out of here.
You sound like every girl I
ever met.
You do it.
Oh, Sandy, Sandy,
wherefore art thou?
They can't come in here, my
folks will kill me.
What's up, Kenick?
One guess.
You got a lot to offer a girl?
You coming down or what?
Get rid of your pals.
That includes you, Zuko.
Well, good. Because sloppy

Have fun, Kenick.

Big spender.

It broke!
How could it break?
I don't know.
I bought it when I was in the
seventh grade.
Oh.
What the hell.
What the hell you think you're

You parked in a no-parking

The whole place is a

Yeah.

Okay, yeah, I'll give you 75 cents for

Yeah?
Vroom, vroom.
Mr. Weaver, we would be proud to show
the nation what fine, bright, clean-cut
wholesome students we
have here at Rydell.
Ah, blanche.
This is Mr. Weaver.
He's a producer for Vince Fontaine's
national bandstand television program.
He's making a surprise visit to all of the high
schools being considered for a live broadcast.
A live broadcast?
How exciting!
But what if something goes
wrong?
That doesn't matter.
The television audience is
pretty forgiving.
What we're looking for is a true
representation of American youth.
Principal McGee, we need your
help.
What is it, fine, wholesome
students?
I want to have my rocket club meetings
in the all-purpose room on Thursdays.
And I want it for future
homemakers of America.
Think of the children.
Think of the children on
rockets.
Ah, yes, these are the kinds of upstanding
students who would be gracing your airwaves.
I think I've seen everything
I need to see.
You're late again, Marty.
I got a note from my mother.
I had a visit from my "friend." My
"friend" came early this month.
And it really cramped my style,
you know what I mean?
Who are you?
Stan Weaver, national bandstand.
Who are you?
Marty maraschino. Senior.
Did you say national bandstand?
With Vince Fontaine?
That's the one.
They're considering Rydell for a live
broadcast from our spring dance.
Vince Fontaine may come here?
If Mr. Weaver feels we truly
represent an American high school.
If there's one thing I know
how to do, it's represent.
You tell Mr. Fontaine that Marty
is waiting for him.
Miss maraschino, please!
Well, it's looking more and more
like Rydell has got what it takes.
Wonderful.
Let's just hope it doesn't rain.
So you were at lover's Lane.
And then what happened?
Did you make it with Rizzo or
not?
Yeah.
My heart wasn't in it.
As long as something was, who
cares?
I'm so mad about what Leo did
to my car.
Danny, we can fix it though,
right?
I don't know. It looks
pretty hopeless.
Did somebody say hopeless?
Hey, Mrs. Murdock.
Any car can be fixed.
Have you boys learned nothing in
my class?
Don't answer that.
All right. How's the patient?
Look, we just got bang out
the dent.
That's all there is to it,
right?
And replace a part.
What part?
The engine.
Where am I supposed to get a
new engine?
Boys, there's an old saying... "there's
a spare part in every parked car."
Where did you hear that?
Prison.
I learned a lot.
You have no idea.
So, you're saying we should
steal from other people's cars?
I said no such thing.
And I will deny it to the board
of education.
No, I'm just inspiring you to follow that automotive
dream and keep your hands off the Chevy impala.
That one's mine.
Good luck.
Okay.
What do you guys, say?
Are you in?
I don't know.
I don't want the get in any
trouble.
It would be a lot of work.
It will still be a piece of
junk.
Danny?
Yeah, I'm in, because I know
what this car can become.
Scrap metal?
Hey, Sonny, what do you
drive, huh?
I drive.
Yeah?
How about you, Putzie?
Who me? What about Doody?
Well...
That's what I thought.
Now come on, guys.
This car could be a major piece
of machinery.
This car could be..
Systematic!
hydromatic!
ultra-matic!
Why it could be greased
lightning!

Watch where you're going.
If someone's in my way, I
don't stop.
You should remember that,
thunder road.
Remember when I run you into
a wall.
All right, all right, put it
down, gents.
None of that in here.
I got a hot date tonight with
that new guy at the grill.
So I can't be staying late
mopping blood off the floor.
You hear me?
We hear you.
Yeah.
Come on.
You guys are lucky this time.
Scorpions are asking for it,
Danny.
What's with you?
Still stuck on that chick?
What are you, nuts?
Hey, Kenickie come here.
The meeting's now in session.
You know what I heard?
Last year the fuzz had thunder road staked
out and everybody got hauled to the clink.
When we get done nobody's going
to catch greased lightning.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Somebody snaking you, Danny.
Bite the weenie, Rizz.
With relish.
I don't know about these chicks.
Yeah.
They're only good for one
thing, right?
What are you supposed to do with them for the
other 23 hours and 45 minutes of the day.
Is that all it takes, is 15
minutes?
Only when he does it twice.
Put that thing away.
I've been practicing. If I get
good enough
maybe Vince Fontaine will put me on
national bandstand or something.
Check this out.
No.
C-c-c miner a. Wait. Give me a
minute.
You want some music?
Sure.
I'll need some money.
I'll be right back.
Hi, Danny.
I can't talk to you right now.
What are you doing later?
I can't talk.
Call me.
No.
Hey, Sandy.
Oh, hi.
How are you?
Fine, thanks.
That's good.
I want to talk to you for a
while now.
What about?
About that night at the pep
rally.
The way I acted, that was terrible.
It really was.
That wasn't me.
You got to believe me.
Well, I mean, it was me, but it
wasn't me.
You see, Sandy, I just have this
image around here.
I know. That's why I'm so glad
that Tom is such a simple person.
Yeah.
Simple's right. It's too bad that
his brains are in his biceps.
You sound jealous.
Jealous? Come on, Sandy. Don't
make me laugh. Ha, ha, ha.
Tom is a great athlete.
What have you ever done.
Come on, Sandy.
I could run circles around those
jerks.
I will believe that when I
see it.
I figured it out.

Are you crazy?
Let's start.
Danny, you get down.
All right.
All right.
You give?
Yeah, I give.
Good.
Oh, okay.
You know what, Zuko, you know, there are some
sports that don't have any physical contact.
Like what?
Like track.
You mean running?
Not just running.
I'm talking about long distance running, cross country

Are you all right?
Danny, talk to me.
It's the least you can do after
the way you treated me.
I already said I was sorry
about that.
Gotcha talking.
You still going out with that
jockstrap?
We're just friends.
Is he taking you to the dance?
That all depends.
On what?
You.
On me?
Although, I don't want to
hurt tom.
I think he'll pull through.
Hi, tom.
So you go to the dance with me?
I'd love to go to the dance

- will I look good on TV?
You're already
two-dimensional.
Whats with the torpedos?
I read that Vince Fontaine likes a
full figured girl. What do you think?
Hey, just in time for flu
season.
Hi. Has anyone asked
you to the dance yet?
Not yet. I'll show 'em,
I'll show 'em all.
- Popsplit.
- That floor issticky.
I'm aware of that.
Hey, let's go someplace else.
Why?
It's too crowded.
We can't be alone.
Danny.
Okay.
Come on.
Hi, girls.
Oh, your hair looks great.
See you in biology.
You nearly pulled my arm out
of the socket.
You want to lose this table?
It's the best they got.
What are you doing?
Want some privacy for us,
that's all.
What are you having, kids?
Coca-Cola, please.
Danny?
I'm not really hungry.
Give me a burger with everything and a cherry coke
with ice cream and French fries for the table.
Two straws with that soda?
She can use mine.
Oh, watch out.
You really are funny, you know?
No, I'm not.
You are.
You are.
Hey, huh?
Yeah, it's cool.
You know, swinging.
Well, well, Danny's back and
Sandy's scratching it.
How are you?
Peachy keen, jelly bean.
You got a couple quarters?
Maybe an apple pies and a coke.
My Dutch street days are over.
Greetings, I got 23 cents.
Who wants to chip in for a dog
sled delight.
I don't know where my money goes.
A dime here fifteen cents there.
Another couple of months, you'll be
picking up the tab for everybody.
A working girl with income.
They don't pay you very much
to start off with.
Still more than we make.
Loan me, I don't get my
allowance until Friday.
You still get an allowance?
When I'm a good boy, I do.
A four dog delight with four
spoons.
And an eskimo pie with a knife.
I think I'll get fries.
What do you want?
Iced water. I'm reducing for
national band stand.
They say the camera adds ten pounds.
Depending on your reception.
Well just make sure they keep
all the good parts.
Okay.
Grab it and growl.
You know, I got so many hickeys on my neck
people are going to think I'm dating Dracula.
Cheer up, a hickey from
Kenickie is like a hallmark.
I care enough to send the very
best.
You pig.
I love it when you talk dirty.
My parents want to invite you to
a barbecue after the dance.
You want to come?
I don't like barbecue.
You don't have to eat anything.
I don't like parents.
Want some?
You sure are a cheap date.
That didn't come out the way I
meant.
I understand.
I always thought you were an
understanding person.
And I thought there's more to you than just being
weird, no matter what everyone says behind your back.
Thanks.
And I don't think you're as goofy and
immature as everyone says behind your back.
Neato.
You got a date to the danceoff?
No.
You want to go?
Yeah!
I'm worried about the contest. We
didn't have a lot of dances back home.
Don't worry.
Just follow my lead.
It could be your big break
Sandy.
Bandstand loves the wholesome
type.
That camera will be on you the
whole time.
I don't have to be on camera,
do I?
No, it ain't radio.
What's the matter?
I'm just really camera shy.
Besides, who wants to watch a bunch of
amateurs dance in a contest on live TV?
You know TV, they'll do any cheap
stunt to get people to watch.
Maybe you ought to stay home
with the folks, play parcheesi.
Come on, Sandy, let's get out
of here.
Oh, okay.
Bye, girls.
Bye, Frenchy.
See you, Sandy.
You know they got these
things called toothpicks.
What is with you tonight?
I don't know.
I guess I'm just growing up
faster than you.
There's only one thing that
you're faster at than me, baby.
There are times when that
ain't what it's all about.
Sometimes you got the
personality of a wet mop.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
To you from me, pinkie Lee.
Oh.
Sorry, French.
The check.
Hey!
Rizzo.
Come back here and give me some
money.
You want some pie with that
shake.
I made an apple pie from a recipe in good housekeeping
that's supposed to drive men wild with desire for apple pie.
You want to come?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, Putzie, 15 minutes.
If I don't pass this algebra quiz
I'm going to be a senior forever.
What's so bad about that?
I want a diploma before I get
my mrs degree.
You are in luck, Lucius.
You get an armed escort home.
Not the arms I'm worried about.
She loves me.
You coming?
No, I think I'd like to hang
out for a little bit longer.
Maybe next time.
Are you okay?
Terrific.
No use crying over a spilled
milkshake.
I'll be all right.
Listen, I don't want to rush you, but it's
almost closing time and I got... whoa.
What?
Well, I hate to tell you this, but
your hair looks like an easter egg.
Beauty school isn't what I
thought it was going to be.
Nothing ever is.
Vi, I dropped out.
Oh, hon.
How do you like waitressing?
You're too young to know.
Maybe I could be one of those
telephone operators.
Nah. I wouldn't want to wear those
little things over my ears.
Don't you worry, hon, you'll
find something.
I know you will.

everyone
help raise money for the 1959
class gift
what's the class gift gonna be?
We're commissioning a statue for the front
lawn. It's gonna be a Rydell cheerleader
who will model for it?
That's up to the landscaping
committee.
And who runs that?
The student council vice
president.
And who is-
it's me alright. It's me.
Okay, now we know.
Did you bring provisions?
You bet.
Don't forget the sign up for
next week's blood drive.
Come on every drop counts.
Sorry, I got to keep my strength
up.
Why not? You're keeping
everything else up.
Don't be crude.
Just saying you're looking good.
Feeling good, too.
Keep your hands off the merch.
This way, Mr. Fontaine.
Oh my god that's Vince Fontaine
I've seen better looking
heads on a mug of beer.
Grow up. I think he's cute.
If you like older guys.
Anyway, here.
What it is?
You may have noticed that I
am stag this evening.
Since I haven't heard you mention a date, I
thought I'd do the noble thing and escort you.
Gardenia?
Pretty.
But I can't take it.
How come?
I read in teen tempo that Vince
Fontaine hates the smell.
It's got to be an improvement
because right now you stink.
Stuff it.
I think you already have.
Jealousy is a Childs pastime
this is so exciting
if you hadn't come back, you
would have missed all this.
Dropping out was the lonesomest
thing I ever did.
How do I look?
Like a beautiful blond
pineapple.
Hey, Rizz.
Frenchie, you know Leo.
Yeah, I guess.
I needed a date and he happened
to be free.
Lucky for me.
We'll see.
Don't forget the blood drive.
You're always somebody's type.
Wanna sign up Rizzo?
Don't bother unless you're
looking for a pint of ice water.
Back off.
Who you telling to back off
when you're on my turf.
You want to settle this here
and now?
Let's go right now.
Easy.
Take the blood next week.
All right?
Come on.
Who does she think she is, huh?
Doesn't matter, baby. You're
with cha cha tonight
that's right. Hey, Zuko.
I want you to meet cha-cha.
How you doing, Zuko, baby?
All right.
Who is she?
They call me cha-cha because I'm the
best dancer at St. Bernadette's.
With the worst reputation
maybe we'll sign up after all.
Super.
Who was that girl?
Oh, no one.
She's just a girl I know.
That's all
how do you know her?
She used to be a friend of my
cousin's.
Come on, let's go in.
You want to go in now?
Of course.
I'm on the prom decorating
committee.
Are you going alone?
Alone?
What's alone?
You.
Just walk me in so I don't trip.
Okay, kids.
Look, we're going to be on the
air in a short time.
Let's keep things going with another warm-up
tune by Johnny casino and the gamers.

You're leading.
I can't help it.
Up till now I had to go to these
things with the other girls.
Hey Doody, can't you spin around
or something.
Shut up, I'm trying to count.
You don't count when you play
guitar.
So?
So pretend like I'm your
guitar. Pluck me.
This is the best night of my
life.
Hey, remember who you're with.
I'm with whoever knows how to
dance.
What are you getting steamed
about now?
Nobody moves in on cha-cha.
Nobody has to.
Get hold of yourself, blanche.
When I hear music, I can't
make my feet behave.
- We go live in five minutes.
- Oh dear.
Look at them go, huh?
What do you say?
Let's do it like we did it back
in teachers college.
I'll coach you.
Sonny, what are you doing?
Washing my hands.
Alright I'll cover you.
Did you learn that in prison?
Convent.
Are you okay?
What if I mess up in from of millions of people?
Danny just promise me we won't be on camera.
How are we going to win if
we're not on camera?
You get camera shy, just look in
my eyes.
You can do that, right?
You're going to be great.
Hey, Marty, do me a favor,
will you?
What do you want?
Find out the cameraman's name.
Ask your friend Vince Fontaine.
I'll see what I can do.
Good golly, miss Molly.
Is this my usual makeup.
Mr. Fontaine.
Thank goodness we're not in
color. What do you want?
I mean, that's my name.
What's your game?
Vince, you want to...
- beat it.
A friend of mine wanted me to ask
you the name of the cameraman.
Oh, waiting for her big
close-up, is she?
Maybe.
Well, his name is Ted, but your friend's out
of luck unless she's as pretty as you are.
Is she?
No.
Well then, what's your name?
Marty.
Marty what?
Maraschino.
Like the cherry.
Sweet.
So Marty, do your folks know that I come into
your room every night over WZXX, that is.
What they don't know won't
hurt them.
I'm judging the dance contest.
I don't think I'm entering.
What?
A knockout like you?
Baby, things sure changed since
I was in high school, last year.
Stop.
What?
What's the matter?
I just never realized you're so...
direct, experienced, erotically aligned?
Old.
Ouch.
- Three minutes to broadcast, Vince.
- Catch you later.
Old? Ridiculous.
I need more bass.
What did you find out?
Too much.
- I mean, the cameraman.
- Ted
okay kids, are you ready?
All right. Good.
We have to go over a couple of ground
rules, first. Okay? Basic rules.
Principal McGee.
I'll wait.
I'll wait.
I won't ask again.
Now, boys and girls, in just a few moments the
entire nation will be watching Rydell
I want you all to be on your best behavior.
So now for the rules, coach Calhoun.
Game rule one.
Couples only.
No solos, no threesomes.
Game rule two.
During the dance contest, if you are tapped on the
shoulder, you must leave the floor immediately.
And rule number three, anyone doing tasteless
or vulgar movements will be disqualified.
Hey, keep it clean.
40 seconds.
Boys and girls, now, without further ado I give you the man
of the hour, the prince of the platters, Mr. Vince Fontaine.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, thank you fans and
friends.
Thank you.
And now, you gals and guys, a
few words to the wise.
You are my best pals and to look your best for
the big contest, be yourself and have a ball.
That's what it's about after all, forget about the camera and
forget the beat and give the folks at home a real treat.
Don't worry where the camera is, if I tap you on the
shoulder just step aside and let the others finish the ride.
Two, one!
Welcome to national bandstand coming
to you live from Rydell high school.
I'm your host Vince Fontaine.
And this is the event you've all
been waiting for.
The national dance off.

Welcome back, students.
I trust you all have fond memories
of our spring dance Saturday night.
Those of you who can still
remember it at all.
Rest assured, the police have been notified and they will find
those individuals who spiked the punch bowl which led to some
extremely embarrassing behavior.
And while we're on the subject, a
brassiere was found under the bleachers,
a size 34-dd Underwire
construction full support.
Will the owner please come to
the office to retrieve it.
What is it, blanche?
Please disregard that last
announcement.
This has been a test.
This was only a test.
Beep.
Okay. Everybody out. Come on.
Welcome to the cinema.
I wish we had money for tickets.
I wish we had gas masks.
It was cabbage night.
Here come the chicks.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hold my money.
Don't let me go near the refreshment stand.
Everything they sell is bad for you.
Popcorn with extra butter?
The artificial kind?
Mm-hmm.
French, you ready for a movie?
Always. I wish there was a way to watch
movies at home any time I wanted.
Let's get to the moon first.
Hey, babe.
There's nobody here.
Come on, Marty, let's get
some popcorn.
I guess we got to watch the
movie.
At a drive-in?
Who does that?
Come on, Sandy, I told you I
was sorry every day for a week.
I know.
That's why I'm here.
You do believe me, don't you?
Yes, but I still think you
and cha-cha went together.
We did not go together.
We just went together.
That's the same thing.
No, it's not.
Not like us.
Besides, if you hadn't run off, I never would
have danced with cha-cha in the first place.
I didn't want to be on camera.
That's just silly.
You're a good dancer.
You shouldn't be so afraid of
stuff.
I lied to my parents.
What?
I told my parents I was going to Frenchie's to
study because they won't let me go to dances.
That's why I didn't want to be
on camera.
I didn't want them to find out that
I lied to them just to be with you.
Oh.
I didn't know that.
Well, now you do.
Well, I think you're lucky to have
parents that care so much about you.
I know.
Mine don't care about anything.
I'm sorry.
Sandy, I'm sorry.
I didn't... oh.
Sandy, would you wear my ring?
Oh, Danny, I don't know what
to say.
Say yes.
Yes.
Oh, Danny, this means so much to me
because I know now that you respect me.
What, 25 cents for a lousy box
of popcorn and two sodas?
Forget it.
What's with you tonight?
I feel like a typewriter.
I skipped a period.
You think you're pg?
I don't know. Big deal
do you think it's Kenickie?
- No, you don't know the guy. -Hey
it's cool you get to skip school.
You don't tell nobody about
this, right?
I'll take to it the grave.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Come on, people, move!
Lady with a baby!
Rizzo's got a bun in the oven.
Hey, Rizzo.
Hear you're knocked up?
What do you do, huh?
Good news travels fast.
Why didn't you tell me.
What's it to you?
I don't know.
I thought I could do something.
Oh, you did enough.
I don't run away from my
mistakes.
Hey, don't worry about it,
Kenickie.
It was somebody else's mistake.
Thanks a lot, kid.
Oh, any time.
Achoo.
I hope you're not getting a
cold.
No, nothing like that.
Probably some drive-in dust.
That's all.
Danny!
Oh, Sandy.
What are you doing?
Don't worry.
There's nobody watching.
Get off me!
What's the matter with you?
I thought I meant something to
you.
Do you think I'm going to
stay with you in this sin wagon?
Sandy, come on.
You can take this piece
of tin... Sandy, Sandy!
You can't just walk out of a
drive-in.

Wow. You guys must have one
amazing teacher.
This car is as hot as the parts
on it.
We didn't steal all of it, some
of it was donated.
Make sure you send thank you
notes.
The judge will like that.
This baby will knock them on
their ears at thunder road.
You could still change your
mind.
Nothing doing.
The flag goes down in three hours
and greased lightning strikes.
Mrs. Murdoch, are you coming?
I don't expect my boys to let
me down, I won't let them down.
Just be sure to fill her up.
I intend to get loaded myself.
I want to talk to you.
Those boys at thunder road
don't play around.
You know that, right?
You want me to punk out?
I'm not saying punking. I'm
just, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Danny, me and you been friends
for a long time, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So you remember that movie that
we saw back when we were kids.
There was a duel and the guy's best
friend, he went with him like his second.
So?
I was thinking, you know, I was thinking maybe
you could be my second at thunder road.
What do you want me to drive
with you?
No.
Hey, what you looking at?
Not one thing.
Danny is going to be my
second at thunder road.
We're going to win this thing!
No, you won't.
What's it to you, Eugene?
Yeah, what do you care who wins?
I don't.
Not particularly.
But matters of speed, propulsion,
those interest me greatly.
And from my calculations and from looking at the scorpions'
superior vehicle, there's no way you boys can win thunder road.
That is without my help.
Laugh, make fun of the geek.
You guys may be cruel, but you
don't know everything.
Why don't you get lost?
Go practice kissing your sister.
Bye, Eugene.
Good luck, you're going to need
it.
What did you have any mind?
Are you crazy?
Let's hear him out.
What do we got to lose?
How about our reputation?
Boy, what you guys go through
just to be cool.
How about winning instead?
Have any of you already been
exposed to radiation?
Oh, that's the girl I was
telling you about.
She doesn't even know who's it
is.
Hey, Patty, why don't you mind
your own business for a change?
Oh, well, well, Sandy young
standing up for the class tramp?
I thought you were a good girl.
Maybe, but I think it's more
important to be kind.
I'll stick with being good.
That's what you do when
you're unappealing.
Did you hear what she said to
me?
I taught her how to cheer.
I don't need anybody to fight
my battles for me.
But I got to admit, that was a
good one.
She had it coming.
And you're the one that
finally gave it to her.
Look, Rizz, I know we haven't been the best
of friends, but if there's anything I can do.
I can take care of myself.
And anybody else who comes
along.
You going to thunder road?
Not a chance.
I've got to go.
I have to talk to Danny.
I see the way he looks at
you, you know.
He never looked at me that way.
No guy's ever looked at me that
way.
The right guy will.
Right.

Don't you want to see us win
this fair and square?
Yeah, I guess.
If it were in any better
condition, it would fly.
According to my calculations, it's
going to, or it might explode.
What?
Don't worry.
It would be over so fast.
You think you got a winner
there, huh?
That's right.
Takes more than a coat of paint
to make it at thunder road.
Oh, yeah?
You guys aren't thinking about
changing your minds, are ya?
No way.
Because we're racing for pinks.
Pinks?
Yeah, pink slips, ownership
papers.
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it. Back where
you belong right CHACH?
I'll stick with a winner.
Don't I, Danny?
Doing this or what
- hey, Kenickie.
What are you doing here?
I'm a sucker, I guess.
Just wanted to say be careful.
Hey, Kenickie.
What is this?
I can't do this.
I might have a kid that needs me
some day.
I gotta be there for Rizz, and
I ain't no chicken.
Yeah.
Hey, as a penny heads up.
Why don't you pick it up for
luck?
Oh, my god.
It was an accident.
You killed him.
He's out cold.
Talk to me, buddy.
Hey, you can still race, right?
You ain't no chicken.
I'm fine.
Let me get behind the wheel.
No, he can't drive.
I'm okay.
Just give me a minute.
You're hurt too bad.
Hey, I hate the scorpions as
much as you do.
Let me do this.
If that's the way it's got to
be.
Come on.
Hey, Putzie?
Yeah.
Take my jacket.
Danny.
Sandy?
What are you doing here?
It's too dangerous.
You don't always have to do something
just because they expect you to.
Yeah.
But I'm doing this for a friend.
And besides, what's the point of living
if you don't take a few chances?
Okay.
Rules are there ain't no rules.
First one to the overpass wins.
Leo, baby, wait.
What's she giving him?
A lock of hair, from her chest.
Ew.
Haul ass, kid.
All right, boys, start your
engines.
All right, boys, start your
engines.
We won!
Yeah!
Woo!
Where's my jacket?
- Hey, Eugene
- yeah, Danny?
Thanks for taking us into the
space age.
You mean I'm a t-bird?
You wear the jacket.
We'll see how it goes.
Wow.

Attention, seniors.
Before the merriment of
commencement commences,
I hope your years with us here
at Rydell high have prepared you
for the challenges you face.
Who knows?
Among you there may be a future
Eleanor Roosevelt or a Lucille ball.
And among you young men there
may be a Joe DiMAGGIO,
a president eisenhower or even a
vice president Nixon.
But always you will have the
glorious memories of Rydell.
Rydell forever.
Bon voyage.
Blanche, stop blubbering.
Here I go.
I'm over the falls.
I don't understand.
How could I flunk phys ed?
Step right up it's for a great
cause, the teacher's retirement fund
and you're the ones that have
driven us to it.
Three chances to put a pie in
the puss
coach Calhoun, how could you
forfeit the t-birds?
Oh don't worry, you will get
your diplomas.
- All you boys have to do is come back
to summer school. -Summer school?!
See? If you had come to class,
you wouldn't have missed.
Oh, wise guy, huh?
Awh you see? You couldn't pinch
one inning.
Close enough, Eugene.
- Not bad.
- Thank you Patty
do you want to show me your
rocket?
Not here.
We have liftoff!
Rizzo?
Should you be doing that in your
condition?
What's it to you?
I was thinking.
What if it was my mistake.
I want to help and be a second.
I think you're more like my
third.
No.
I mean, I want to be there for
you.
Come on, I'll make an honest woman out
of you and no one will ever know.
Forget it.
It was a false alarm.
What?
I'm not pregnant.
Okay. Well the offer still
stands.
That's a line I ain't biting.
It ain't no line.
Wow.
What?
Nobody's ever looked at me
that way before.
Is that a yes?
They're so beautiful.
I wish I could have something
like that.
Why don't you give me a
chance, Marty.
You know what?
Maybe I will.
Maybe I'm not ready for a real
man.
You won't be disappointed.
I got you your favorite.
Red dye number 2?
Yep.
Yum.
Zuko?
You got to be kidding me.
What is this? Halloween?
How did you get a letterman's
sweater.
When you were out stealing
hubcaps, I lettered in track.
I don't believe it.
Danny Zuko turned jock.
What are you doing?
Destining us to win over some
chick?
You know, you guys mean a lot
to me.
But Sandy does, too.
And besides, I don't want to be
the same thing all the time.
It's boring.
Sandy?
