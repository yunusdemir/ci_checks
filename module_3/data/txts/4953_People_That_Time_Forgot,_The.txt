     OK...
 HOLD IT.
                IS IT ALL RIGHT
                IF WE GET BACK
                 TO WORK NOW?
THANKS AWFULLY.
SORRY TO BE
SUCH A BORE.
                     NOT AT ALL,
                 LADY CHARLOTTE.
                IT'S RATHER FUN.
AHEM...
MR. GRAHAM.
         HOGAN, YOUR JOB
         IS TO LOOK AFTER
             THE AMPHIB,
                 NOT LUG
                 THAT STUFF
                 AROUND.
         WELL, ONE OF US
         HAS TO BE NICE
         TO THE LADY, MAJOR.
             PLUCKY
         LITTLE WOMAN.
BIT OF A RESPONSIBILITY
ON A TRIP LIKE THIS,
     THOUGH.
                     DIDN'T HAVE
             A CHOICE, CAPTAIN.
                    WE AGREED TO
                 TAKE A REPORTER
             FROM THE NEWSPAPER
             THAT FINANCED US.
                 THEY SENT HER.
NOW, BE FAIR, BEN.
SHE DOES TAKE
GOOD PICTURES.
                        MAYBE.
         BUT SHE'S ONE PROBLEM
         I COULD DO WITHOUT.
         [Wind howls]
     [Ship's bell rings]
         IF THE WEATHER
                 HOLDS,
             WE SHOULD REACH
     THE LAST KNOWN POSITION
         OF YOUR FRIEND TYLER
                     IN 3 DAYS.
         AT WHICH POINT,
         WE SHOULD SIGHT
            THE COASTLINE
     OF THIS MYSTERIOUS
         ICE CONTINENT
             HE DESCRIBES
             IN HIS LOG.
             YOU SOUND AS THOUGH
                 YOU STILL HAVE
         YOUR DOUBTS, CAPTAIN.
     OH, IF WE DID,
         MAJOR,
         THE ROYAL NAVY
         WOULDN'T BE
         HELPING YOU.
 NO, IT WAS THE SPECIMENS
     THAT TYLER INCLUDED
         IN THIS CANISTER.
AND WHEN DR. NORFOLK, HERE,
CONFIRMED THAT THEY
WERE GENUINE--
     WHY DO YOU THINK
     I WENT TO THE TOP MAN
         IN EUROPE?
OH, NOW,
HARDLY, BEN.
DR. SCHENKELMAN
IN VIENNA--
         OH, COME ON,
             DOCTOR.
         IF IT HADN'T BEEN
         FOR YOUR WORD,
         THE <i> LONDON TIMES</i>
        WOULD NEVER HAVE AGREED
                    TO BACK THIS
                     EXPEDITION
                AND YOU KNOW IT.
     I DON'T THINK
    I'LL EVER FORGET
         THE DAY
 WHEN MAJOR BEN McBRIDE
     WALKED INTO MY ROOM
AT THE NATURAL HISTORY
     MUSEUM...
        WITH THAT CANISTER.
ALMOST SPILLED
YOUR HOT MILK,
DIDN'T YOU?
IT WAS QUITE
A MOMENT, BEN.
         TYLER MAKES IT SOUND
         A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE.
         A CONTINENT FULL OF
         CAVEMEN AND DINOSAURS?
     DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE
         THERE'S A CHANCE
                     THAT TYLER
                     MAY STILL
                     BE ALIVE?
IF I DIDN'T,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE.
        DOC KNOWS
     WHERE I STAND.
    I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
     ABOUT DINOSAURS.
I'M STILL HOPING
TO CONVERT HIM.
     [Ship's bell rings]
 [Ring]
         [Ring]
             BOY, I'M SURE
        GLAD WE'RE GOING IN
             BY AIR, MAJOR.
            ME, TOO,
             HOGAN.
     I'D HATE TO HAVE
        TO CLIMB THAT.
     I'D SAY IT WAS
 ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
 AND I'M QUITE GOOD
 AT THIS SORT OF THING.
DID I EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT THE MATTERHORN?
             ONCE OR TWICE.
             JUST HOW LONG
             HAVE WE GOT,
                 CAPTAIN?
             3 TO 4 WEEKS.
             HALF WHAT
             WE PLANNED,
     BUT WE HADN'T EXPECTED
         SO MUCH PACK ICE.
         IF IT CLOSES IN
             ON US--
         AH, COME ON,
            CAPTAIN.
     THIS SHIP IS BUILT LIKE
     THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR.
            IT MAY BE,
            MR. HOGAN,
     BUT THAT ICE COULD
        CRUSH THIS HULL
     LIKE A MATCHBOX.
         AND IF THAT
         HAPPENED--
             THERE'LL BE
             NO TRIP HOME
             FOR ANY OF US.
            OK, HOGAN, LET'S
         WINCH THE AMPHIBIAN
             INTO THE WATER.
                THE SOONER
             WE GET AIRBORNE,
                THE BETTER.
                         HOGAN!
                 OK, LET'S GO.

MAINLY STATIC FOR
THE LAST 2 HOURS, SIR,
BUT THEY'RE
STILL TRANSMITTING,
AND I THINK
THEY'RE STILL
AIRBORNE.
 AT LEAST THEY'RE
     ALIVE.
             AND THEY'VE FLOWN
             OVER 200 MILES.
             MUST BE WELL OVER
            THE ICE WALL BY NOW.
             [Squawks]
         HEY, WHAT THE--
             IT'S A PTERODACTYL!
                     [Squawking]
                     ABSOLUTELY

HE'S CLOSE!
             HOGAN!
             RIGHT.

     [Norfolk]
     OH, NONSENSE.
YOU DID EXTREMELY WELL.
        STILL IN ONE
         PIECE?
 OH, JUST.
 HOW ABOUT
THE PLANE?
             HOGAN?
                         YEAH.
 WHAT KIND OF SHAPE
     WE IN?
                         WELL,
                     NOT GOOD.
                        BUT, UH,
                 IT'S FIXABLE.

            IT'S HARD
            TO TELL.
         NOT MUCH
     THEY COULD DO
         ANYWAY.
                WELL, IF THEY
                 SAIL AWAY,
                 WE'RE SUNK.
         NOBODY'S GONNA
        SAIL AWAY, HOGAN.
 THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME
     FOR EVERYTHING.
         [Wind howls]
         ANY LUCK,
         MR. GRAHAM?
                     NO, SIR.
             THEY'VE STOPPED
                 TRANSMITTING.
         [Sighs]
 WILL THEY GET THAT PLANE
     BACK INTO THE AIR?
 THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
SEND A RESCUE PARTY IN
OVER THOSE CLIFFS.
WHAT THE DEVIL
ARE WE GOING TO DO,
SIR?
 WE'RE GOING TO WAIT,
     MR. WHITBY.
         WE SHALL CHART
         THIS SECTION
        OF THE COASTLINE,
    AND WE SHALL STAY HERE
     AS LONG AS WE CAN.
        MOUNT A 24-HOUR
     LISTENING WATCH,
     WILL YOU, MR. GRAHAM?
             AYE, AYE, SIR.
BUT SUPPOSING
THE ICE CLOSES IN,
SIR.
     LET ME WORRY ABOUT THAT,
        WILL YOU, MR. WHITBY?
             START WORK ON THE
             CHARTS, PLEASE.
AYE, AYE, SIR.
         READY...HEAVE!
         READY...
         HEAVE!
            UGH!
        OK, LET'S
         TAKE 5.
        WHAT WE REALLY NEED
            IS A WINCH.
             YEAH, WELL,
         WE HAVEN'T GOT ONE.
                         [Hogan]
             YOU KNOW, WHAT WE
         REALLY NEED IS A WINCH.
                 YEAH.
            WE MUST REMEMBER
             TO BRING ONE
             NEXT TIME.
         GO EASY
     ON THAT STUFF,
         HOGAN.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
NERVE TONIC, MAJOR.
THE WAR,
REMEMBER?
        WELL, THIS ISN'T
     THE WESTERN FRONT.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
IT'S WORSE.
     NO, NO, BELIEVE ME.
             I WAS THERE.
                PTERODACTYLS ARE
            FAR MORE INTERESTING
                 THAN GERMANS.
INTERESTING?
 GEE!
DOC, YOU PROFESSOR TYPES
ARE ALL THE SAME.
PTERODACTYLS,
HUH?
YOU GIVE ME
THE RED BARON
ANY DAY.
ANYWAY,
ALL I WANT TO DO IS
FIX UP THAT AMPHIBIAN
AND GET US
THE HELL
OUT OF HERE.
             WHAT ARE YOU
             TALKING ABOUT?
             WE JUST STARTED.
             WE CAME HERE
             TO GET TYLER,
             AND THAT'S WHAT
         WE'RE GOING TO DO.
WELL, YOU BETTER CALL IN
        THE NAVY, MAJOR,
     BECAUSE WE ARE GOING
             TO NEED SOME
            REINFORCEMENTS.
     YOU WORRY TOO MUCH,
         HOGAN.
         GET THAT PROP FIXED
     AND CHECK OUT THE TAIL.

     [McBride]
    HOW'S IT GOING?
            OH, QUITE WELL,
                 THANK YOU.
                OH, COULD I HAVE
            A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOU?
     WELL, YEAH.
                         MMM.
    WHERE DO YOU
     WANT ME?
                 UH, THAT ROCK
                 WILL DO FINE.
                 MAKES A GOOD
                    BACKGROUND.
         RIGHT.
                 OK.
                 HOLD IT.
             AAH!
            [Laughs]
             I THINK McBRIDE'S
             FOUND SOMETHING
             YOU MIGHT LIKE
                 TO LOOK AT.
    REALLY?
YOU'RE A REAL
BARREL OF LAUGHS,
YOU KNOW IT?
A FULLY GROWN
STEGOSAURUS.
NOW, ISN'T THAT
ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL?
I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE
THIS MOMENT, BEN.
                 AREN'T THEY
                SUPPOSED TO BE
                 VERY DOCILE
                     AND VERY
                     STUPID?
     WELL, IN THEORY,
         YES.
                     ESPECIALLY
                     THE FEMALE
                 OF THE SPECIES.
         YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
        A FEELING WE'VE JUST
            FOUND OUR WINCH.
                         WELL,
         WHY DON'T WE USE HIM
         TO TOW THE AMPHIB OUT?
[Growling softly]
         ACTUALLY,
         THAT'S NOT
         A BAD IDEA.
                        IT LOOKS
                     BIG ENOUGH.
                     BUT SUPPOSE
             HE DOESN'T WANT TO.
     ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO
         IS TIE A ROPE
             TO HIS TAIL
                 AND MAKE HIM
                    RUN AWAY.
     THEY SHOULD MAKE
 A GOOD ANCHOR POINT.
                         YEAH.
         [Gentle roar]
                     IS HE GOING
                 TO FEEL THIS?
        NO, NOT YET.
HIS NERVOUS SYSTEM WORKS
ABOUT 100 TIMES SLOWER
THAN OURS.
             I HOPE
            YOU'RE RIGHT.
                        HOGAN!
                         READY?
                 HOLD ONTO
                 YOUR HAT.
                 HEY!
             CHARLY!
                GET THE HELL
             OUT OF THE WAY,
                 GODDAMN IT!
KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON.
             YAHOO!
         GO ON!
 GO ON! SHOO!
        SHOO!
         GO ON!
         GO!
        [Trumpeting roar]
         HEY!
        [Trumpeting roar]
             SHE'S CLEAR!
 NOW, HOW ARE WE
 GOING TO STOP IT?
                    MAJOR!
 ATTABOY, MAJOR!
                 COME ON, MAJOR!
                I'M GOING
             FOR THE ROCKS!
         MAJOR!
 WHOA! HOO!
                     OH, BOY.
                        ISN'T IT
                     MARVELOUS?
                     IT WORKED!
             WHOA!
                 YOU ALMOST
            GOT YOURSELF KILLED.
                 LISTEN,
             YOUR FAMILY'S
                 NEWSPAPER
                 MAY BE PAYING
                FOR THIS TRIP,
             BUT FROM NOW ON,
                 JUST QUIT
             CLOWNING AROUND.
                 UNDERSTAND?
             COME ON.
         NOW, DON'T GET SORE
             AT THE MAJOR.
     LOOK, I WAS WITH HIM
     FOR 3 YEARS IN FRANCE.
        HE'S ALL RIGHT.
             HE'S JUST
     A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT
     WHAT HE'S GOT US INTO,
    YOU BEING A LADY
        AND ALL.
             YOU PROMISED
         TO FORGET THAT,
                 REMEMBER?
             AS FOR McBRIDE,
                 DON'T WORRY,
                     I CAN LOOK
                 AFTER MYSELF.
     I'M GOING TO HAVE
     TO CUT ABOUT, UH,
             10 INCHES
                        OFF EACH
                 OF THOSE BLADES
                     TO BALANCE
                     THEM OFF.
         THEN WE'RE GOING
             TO LOSE A LOT
                OF THRUST.
WILL IT GET US
IN THE AIR?
             IF NONE OF US
             HAS TOO BIG A
            BREAKFAST, YES.
HOW LONG
DO YOU FIGURE
IT'LL TAKE?
         WELL,
     WITH THE RUDDER
AND ALL THE OTHER ITEMS,
IT'S GOING TO BE, UH...
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT
3 OR 4 DAYS.
                 [Sighs]
     CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE
         THAT MUCH TIME.
             YOU 2 GAME
            TO GO IN ON FOOT?
                     WELL, YES.
     WELL, YES.
             YOU'RE CRAZY!
             FOR ALL WE KNOW,
         TYLER COULD BE SITTING
 JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE
         OF THESE HILLS.
WE GET UP
TO THAT RIDGE,
WE MAY BE ABLE TO SEE
SOME OF THOSE PEAKS
HE DESCRIBED.
WE'LL BE HEADING
DUE SOUTH.
IN 3 DAYS TIME,
I'LL SEND UP A FLARE.
AT 9:00 IN THE MORNING
AND 3:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.
WE COULD BE BACK
BEFORE YOU'RE
THROUGH HERE.
                    WHAT ABOUT
                 THE GODDAMN
                     MONSTERS?
TRUST ME.
I LOOKED AFTER YOU
IN FRANCE, DIDN'T I?
                     THE WAY I
                    REMEMBER IT,
                I WAS THE ONE
            WHO SAVED YOUR LIFE.
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN,
HOGAN.
 I OWE YOU ONE,
     RIGHT?
                     RIGHT.
 WELL, LET'S
GET STARTED.
             YOU STILL ANNOYED
                 AT HAVING TO
             BRING ME ALONG?
NO, NOT REALLY.
IT'S JUST THAT
CERTAIN KINDS OF GIRLS
ARE HARD TO TAKE.
                OH, YOU MEAN
                    MY KIND?
     WELL, THE WORLD'S
     A CHANGING PLACE,
             McBRIDE.
                 YOU KNOW WHAT
            THE REAL PROBLEM IS?
    YOU JUST CAN'T STAND
            COMPETITION.
LADY, I BELIEVE IN A MAN
DOING A MAN'S WORK,
THAT'S ALL.
        [Trumpeting roar]
WHAT IS IT,
DOC?
            IT CAN ONLY BE
             ONE THING...
             PREHISTORIC.
             [Roar]
     DEFINITELY
     PREHISTORIC.
             [Roar]
            [Scream]
             THAT'S HUMAN.
        [Woman screams]
         [Growling]
             [Roar]
                        BEN!
         YOU HURT?
     NO.
THANKS.
                     A GENUINE
                     CAVEGIRL.
 MMM.
            SHE'LL SUIT YOU
                 PERFECTLY.
SHE'S ALL
YOURS, DOC.
YOU'RE
THE EXPERT.
         IN FOSSILS,
            PERHAPS.
         THIS IS A LITTLE
         OUTSIDE MY FIELD.
                DON'T TOUCH!
             SHE SPEAKS
             ENGLISH.
THAT'S CRAZY.
NO, IT DOESN'T
 MAKE SENSE.
     BEN.
 SEE THIS KNIFE
 SHE'S CARRYING?
     IT'S A BOWIE
        KNIFE.
     I DON'T KNOW
     HOW THE HELL
     SHE GOT IT.
     WELL, YES,
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN
IN CONTACT WITH TYLER.
                 TYLER.
             GOOD GOD!
        SHE KNOWS THE NAME.
 WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
                    AJOR.
                AAH.
AJOR, LISTEN,
DID TYLER TEACH YOU
TO SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE?
                     YES.
            HE TEACH YOU,
                TOO?
NO. TYLER AND ME
LEARNED TOGETHER.
GROW UP
TOGETHER.
TYLER IS A FRIEND
OF MINE.
 I GUESS HE'S A FRIEND
    OF YOURS, TOO, HUH?
                WAS GOOD MAN...
                 ALL GONE.
                     GONE NOW.
            AJOR HAS NO FRIENDS.
                 NO PEOPLE.
                     PULL THAT
                     PHOTOGRAPH
                     OF TYLER.
                         AJOR...
                         LOOK.
             GO ON...TAKE IT.
             YOUR FRIEND TYLER
             SEEMS TO HAVE MADE
            QUITE AN IMPRESSION.
             WHY DON'T YOU,
                 UH...
     GO AND LIGHT A FIRE
             OR SOMETHING?
        [Distant squawk]
         [Distant roar]
        [Roars and howls]
             RIGHT, I'VE GOT
             THE WHOLE STORY.
             SHE COMES FROM
             A RACE OF PEOPLE
             CALLED THE GALU.
                 IT'S A
             STONE AGE TRIBE,
            OR IT LEAST IT WAS
                WHEN TYLER
         AND A GIRL CALLED LISA
             STUMBLED INTO ONE
         OF THEIR SETTLEMENTS.
                         LISA--
         WASN'T THAT THE GIRL
            THAT TYLER RESCUED?
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE ONLY OTHER SURVIVOR
OF THE ORIGINAL PARTY.
                     GO ON.
WELL, IT APPEARS
THAT TYLER AND THE GIRL
 WERE WELCOMED
 BY THE GALU
AND LIVED WITH THEM
FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS.
I'M GLAD SOMEBODY'S
FRIENDLY.
DURING THAT TIME,
THEY TAUGHT THE GALU
FARMING SKILLS,
GENERALLY HELPED THEM
ADVANCE FROM THE STONE AGE
INTO THE IRON AGE.
WHY IS SHE SO UPSET
OVER TYLER'S PICTURE?
BECAUSE ANOTHER
MORE ADVANCED RACE
CALLED THE NAGA
DIDN'T LIKE
THE COMPETITION.
THEY MASSACRED
EVERY GALU
THEY COULD
LAY THEIR HANDS ON.
     IS...TYLER DEAD?
         WELL,
 THERE'S A CHANCE
THAT TYLER AND LISA
MAY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.
THE NAGAS USUALLY
SACRIFICE THEIR
PRISONERS
TO APPEASE
THEIR VOLCANO GOD.
        WELL, IN THIS CASE,
 IT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE
        TO KEEP THEM ALIVE.
         THEIR KNOWLEDGE
     WOULD HELP THE ADVANCE
         OF THE NAGAS.
         WELL,
     I HOPE NOT.
        THEY SOUND
 A PRETTY VILE BUNCH.
     AJOR WAS ONE OF
THE FEW GALUS TO ESCAPE.
    AND SHE'S BEEN
ON THE RUN EVER SINCE.
[McBride]
WHEN DID ALL
THIS HAPPEN?
ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO.
THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
THAT TYLER MAY STILL BE ALIVE.
        CAN AJOR TAKE US
    TO WHERE THE NAGAS LIVE?
             [Screech]
                     GODDAMN IT,
                    ANOTHER ONE.
                 I TOLD YOU...
                 I TOLD YOU WHAT
             I WAS GOING TO DO.
             [Shriek]
                         HA!
                     I TOLD YOU.
        [Distant roars]
             [Growl]
            [Screech]
        [Wings flapping]
DON'T THESE THINGS
EVER SLEEP?
         THE ISLAND
         NEVER SLEEPS.
        [Trumpeting roar]
     [Flare pistol fires]
        HERE.
                     AAH!
         TAKE IT AWAY!
         TAKE IT AWAY!
         TAKE IT AWAY!
         OHH! OHH!
         OH, GOD!
             OH!
             [Pants]
                    THAT'S A
                    BIG ONE.
                     OH, THAT'S
                     A BEAUTY!
                    THAT'S A
             POECILOTHERIA
                 FASCIATA.
     [Whimpers]
             IT'S NOT FUNNY!
            [Laughs]
I DON'T BELIEVE IT,
CHARLY.
I THOUGHT NOTHING
COULD FAZE YOU.
             HAIRY PLANE RIDE,
                 AJOR'S FRIEND
             IN THE FOREST...
     YOU TOOK THEM ON
     WITHOUT BLINKING
                AN EYE.
                 AND ALONG COMES
         THIS LITTLE SPIDER...
LITTLE? OH!
             IT WAS CUTE.
 IT WAS KIND OF CUDDLY,
         TOO, WASN'T IT?
NOW, STOP IT.
YOU'RE MAKING
MY FLESH CREEP.
         AT LEAST IT PROVES
             YOU'RE HUMAN.
WELL, EVERYONE HAS
THEIR BREAKING POINT,
McBRIDE.
WITH ME,
IT'S SPIDERS.
WITH YOU...IT'S ME.
         [Distant howls]
    WHAT IS IT?
            BAND-LU.
A HUNTING PARTY?
     I HOPE THEY'RE NOT
             HUNTING US.
         IN THAT CASE,
    I SHALL TRY AND GET
             A PICTURE.
     HOLD IT.
        GALU! GALU!
         [All shouting]
FLARE PISTOL.
 AJOR, NO!
                 HIS NAME IS
                     MIKAY.
         HE WAS GOOD FRIEND
             OF TYLER.
            DID HE HAVE TIME
             TO SAY ANYTHING
                ABOUT TYLER?
     HE WAS TAKEN
     WITH MANY OTHERS
 TO MOUNTAIN OF
     SKULLS,
     THE CITY WHERE
     THE NAGAS LIVE.
                         CAN YOU
                 TAKE US THERE?
         YES.
    BUT IT'S HOPELESS.
 EVEN IF YOU CAN
     GET IN,
YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE
 NAGORAMATA.
                     WHO'S HE?
    THE VOLCANO GOD
     OF THE NAGAS.
    HE RULES THE LAND.
NO ONE CAN GO AGAINST
 HIS WILL AND LIVE.
     [Distant screeches]
[Norfolk]
WHERE'S AJOR GOING?
        SHE'S LOOKING FOR
             THE ENTRANCE
             TO A CAVE.
             IF SHE FINDS IT,
             IT'LL MAKE LIFE
                A LOT EASIER.
                 WE'D BE CRAZY
             TO GO OVER THE TOP
                     IF THERE'S
                     A SHORTCUT.
             AAH!
                BEN!
             GET OUT
            OF HERE!
         AAH!
     YOU BOUNDER!
                 OOH!
             UGH!
             AHH!
             OHH!
         [Shouts in
        Band-lu language]
             UH! OOH!
     LEAVE ME! LEAVE ME!
             UGH.
             OHH!
[Charly]
HE'S AWAKE.
                     [Norfolk]
                     BEN? BEN,
                CAN YOU HEAR ME?
    NORFOLK, CHARLY,
     YOU ALL RIGHT?
WE THOUGHT
YOU WERE DEAD.
        WHERE ARE WE?
                 AT THE ENTRANCE
            OF THE BAND-LU CAMP,
                     BEHIND YOU,
                 UP THE SLOPE.
     ANY IDEA WHAT
     THEY PLAN TO DO
        WITH US?
             [Roar]
         [Trampling]
         I THINK WE'RE
     SOME SORT OF OFFERING.
                     [Grunts]
         THESE STAKES
     WERE IN THE GROUND
     WHEN WE GOT HERE.
                    YOU MEAN
             A SACRIFICIAL
                 OFFERING?
             NO.
             NO,
        NOT RELIGIOUS.
         SOMETHING
        MORE PRACTICAL.
         [Growling]
                     SOMEBODY'S
                 DINNER, THEN.
     SORRY, CHARLY.
        YOU'RE OK,
     YOU KNOW THAT?
            SHH!
    I THINK IT'S BETTER
     NOT TO TALK.
 SOME OF THEM HUNT
     BY SOUND,
        RATHER THAN SMELL.
             [Roars]
            [Grunts]
                     [Panting]
             OH, GOOD GIRL,
                 MY NOTES.
             I GET FOR YOU.
             BAND-LU NOT SEE.
            [Yells in
        Band-lu language]
            GREAT. NO GUN,
            NO AMMUNITION.
                GOD KNOWS
             WHAT WE'LL DO
         IF THEY FOLLOW US.
     THEY WON'T.
 THEY'RE AFRAID TO CROSS
 OVER THE BOUNDARY.

         HOGAN TO <i> POLAR QUEEN.</i>
            [Static]
                LOOK,
         I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
     I JUST HOPE YOU'RE
     STILL OUT THERE,
         ALL RIGHT?
        OUR REPAIRS TO THE PLANE
        ARE JUST ABOUT FINISHED.
                 I STILL HAVE TO
             TEST-FLY THE SHIP.
     UH, IF SHE CHECKS OUT
         ALL RIGHT,
             THEN I'M GOING TO
         LOOK OUT FOR THE MAJOR.
             LOOK, FROM WHAT
        I'VE SEEN OF THIS PLACE,
             THERE'S GOING
            TO BE A PROBLEM
         IN TRYING TO FIND
         SOMEWHERE TO LAND.
                ANYWAY,
             THE DEAL IS,
        IF THEY'RE NOT BACK
         AFTER 3 WEEKS,
                I FLY OUT
             ON MY OWN.
     SO DON'T YOU
 GO ON OFF WITHOUT ME,
        YOU HEAR?
             SOME DEAL.
         ANYWAY, IT'S NICE
         TALKING TO YOU.
            THIS IS HOGAN.
                 OUT.
            WHOO!
                 WHAT DO YOU
                THINK OF IT,
                    NORFOLK?
         ABSOLUTELY
         REMARKABLE!
DO YOU THINK
IT'S SAFE?
     THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
            TO FIND OUT--
                    KEEP MOVING.
 CHARLY.
                        COME ON!
                     THAT'S IT,
                     THAT'S IT!
         OK, BABY,
    DON'T YOU LET ME DOWN!
         OK, LET HER GO!
         MOVE IT UP!
     THIS IS THE COUNTRY
             OF THE NAGAS.
[Charly]
LOOKS PRETTY GRIM.
            [McBride]
        SO ARE THE NAGAS.
            IT'S 9:00.
     TIME TO PUT UP A FLARE.
 [Distant screeches
     and howls]
     NAGAS!
         [Horse neighs]
     WELCOME.
             YOU ARE SURPRISED
            I SPEAK YOUR TONGUE.
         YOUR FRIEND TYLER,
         HE HAS TAUGHT US
             MUCH ALREADY.
 WE HEARD HE WAS
    A PRISONER.
                AND YOU CAME
             TO RESCUE HIM?
         DID THAT CREATURE
     FILL YOU WITH THESE LIES?
                 TYLER'S A MAN
                OF GREAT POWER
                 WHO HONORS US
             WITH HIS PRESENCE.
     IT IS HE WHO SENT ME
            TO WELCOME YOU.
                COME WITH ME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
TYLER TALKING
THESE GUYS AROUND.
WELL, YOU ALWAYS SAID
HE WAS A SURVIVOR.
     YEAH, BUT HOW DID
 HE KNOW WE WERE COMING?
                 GOOD QUESTION.
                 UNFORTUNATELY,
                WE HAVE TO VISIT
         THE MOUNTAIN OF SKULLS
                        TO LEARN
                     THE ANSWER.
             GODDAMN IT!
             WHEN I PUT YOU
                 TOGETHER,
            YOU STAY TOGETHER!
                 UGH! OH, NO!
                     UH, NO, NO,
                 I HAVEN'T HEARD
             FROM THE MAJOR YET.
                SHOULD BE BACK
                 ANY DAY NOW.
     HMM? HEY, I'LL CALL YOU
         TOMORROW, ALL RIGHT?
                     OK, HOGAN,
                 OVER AND OUT.
                     HOGAN?
             YEAH?
                IF I DON'T GET
                 OUT OF HERE,
             YOU'RE GONNA GO
                 BANANAS.
            YEAH.
         [Distant howls]
             I THOUGHT YOU WERE
             GOING TO SEE TYLER.
 SO DID I.
             HOLD YOUR TONGUE!
            ONLY SABBALA SPEAKS.
                 [Shouts]
TAKE YOUR HANDS
    OFF ME!
         [Speaks in
         Naga language]
                 LET ME GO.
         [Shouts in
         Naga language]
                     NAGORAMATA.

YOU SON OF A GUN,
WE'D ALMOST
GIVEN UP HOPE
OF FINDING YOU.
                     YES, WE HAD
                    A ROUGH TIME
                 GETTING HERE.
                        ANYWAY,
                 THANK GOODNESS
                 WE FOUND YOU.
YOU MEAN,
YOU CAME HERE
TO FIND ME?
SURE. WE GOT THE MESSAGE
FROM THE CANISTER.
                     YEAH,
                IT WAS PICKED UP
                 OFF THE COAST
                 OF SCOTLAND
                    AT THE END
                     OF 1917.
        OH, MY NAME

     HOW-HOW ARE THEY?
                 YOUR MA AND PA
                 ARE BOTH FINE.
             IN FACT, IT WAS
         YOUR PA THAT GOT ME
             INTO THIS THING.
         HE HASN'T
     CHANGED MUCH, HAS HE?

THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF TIME TO TALK
ABOUT THAT.

LIKE BAD NEWS.
                         HE IS.
    WELL, IN THAT CASE,
     WE HAVEN'T GOT
 A MOMENT TO WASTE.
    ONE OF THE GIRLS
 IS A FRIEND OF YOURS--
    AJOR.
                 AJOR,

     YEAH.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
WHERE HAVE THEY
GOT LISA?

                         SABBALA
                     KILLED HER.
     WE WOULDN'T COOPERATE
         WITH THE NAGAS.
                 LOOKS AS THOUGH
                 THEY GAVE YOU
            A PRETTY ROUGH TIME.

                 OF SOMETHING.
                 CHARLY?
            YES?
 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
         ABOUT THAT GUN
                 YOU HAD STASHED
            IN YOUR CAMERA CASE?
    I WAS KEEPING IT
     IN CASE WE
     GOT INTO A JAM.
