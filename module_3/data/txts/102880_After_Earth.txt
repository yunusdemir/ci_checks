<font color="#A9F5F2">Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9, heavy in distress.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Engines 1 and 2 are offline.
We're losing her.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Go! Go!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I've heard stories of Earth.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">A paradise...</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">until we destroyed it.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">The founding of the Uniting Ranger Corps,
One thousand years ago</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">was a global military effort</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">in evacuation of earth.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">The rangers would lead the settlement
of mankind in its new home.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Nova Prime.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">But we were not alone.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">The aliens released the Ursas.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Monsters. Bred to kill humans.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Technically blind.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">The Ursas see humans based
on the pheromones</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">secrete when frightened</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">They literally smell our fear.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Humankind was again
in danger of extinction,</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">and again turned to the rangers
for the answer.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">And that answer
came in the form</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">of the prime commander
Cypher Raige.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">The original Ghost.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">He's believed to be
soul completely free of fear,</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">that to an Ursa...</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">he's invisible.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">This phenomena is known
as "Ghosting".</font>
This isn't a race, cadet.
Raige.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Your test scores
are very impressive.</font>
In the classroom you are
an outstanding ranger,
but in the field you collapse.
I'm not advancing you.
You may try again next year.
Sir, I am dedicated,
I've studied
and consistently displayed conduct
becoming a ranger, sir.
I request that the commander
reconsider his assessment, sir.
Cadet...
- Sir,
my father is returning home tonight.
I haven't seen him in...
It's a very special day
for our family.
and I've gotta be able
to tell him that I'm a ranger, sir.
You tell your father...
that I said welcome home.
Dismissed.
Faia.
Hi.
How were finals?
How were finals?
-I wasn't advanced to ranger.
Where do we look
when we speak?
I was not advanced to ranger.
You were not advanced to ranger...
I was not advanced to ranger, sir.
That's all right, you're young...
I ran the canyons 11 seconds
faster than you did.
You weren't ready.
Velan is a good man,
he knows his stuff.
If you were, he would've promoted you.
You weren't ready.
I'm not hungry.
I'm going to my room.
Are you asking me
or telling me?
May I go to my room, sir?
-Denied! Sit down!
Our last visit to Iphitos...
flying tomorrow.
Supervising training...
and after it's completed,
I'm announcing my retirement.
Retirement?
Maybe I'll work with you...
in Turbine division.
Together.
I want my family back.
I want you back.
That boy in there...
is trying to find you.
He's a feeling boy.
He's an intuitive boy.
He watched you read that book
with Senshi his entire life.
He's reading that book now.
He's reaching for you.
Don't get me wrong,
I respect everything you've done.
But you have a son
in the other room that...
who do not know.
He blames himself
on what happened to Senshi.
He thinks it's his fault.
He's drowning.
And he does not need
a commanding officer.
He needs a father.
Pack your bags.
You're coming with me to Iphitos.
This was a really good decision.
Now go and make some
good memories together.
You take it easy on your father.
He's a little rusty.
Okay.
General Raige.
I was on the plateau.
You saved me and four others.
I just came from seeing
my baby girl's face for the first time.
Stand me up.
-That won't be necessary, ranger.
Damn it, stand me up!
<font color="#A9F5F2">What's that, Serge?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Pull.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Looks good.</font>
I'm reading "Moby-Dick".
Your mother told me.
That's great.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Our military transporter will arrive
training base on Iphitos in seven hours.</font>
I'm gonna grab some rack time.
I recommend you do the same.
Hey!
Can you read?
I said, can you read?
Yes, sir.
Well, there's a sign back there:
"Authorized Personnel Only."
Why didn't you read that?
What's in the cage?
Might wanna go easy on him, Serge.
That's the Prime Commander son
right there.
You're Raige's kid?
-What's in there?
You wanna see?
Kit, we have to go.
Right now.
Is that...
-They surprised us.
Senshi, abstract those things.
An Ursa?
-Taking it to Iphitos.
For ghost training.
You wanna see
if you can ghost?
Ghosting is when you don't have
a trace of fear in you.
Most guys freeze.
That's your cerebral cortex
looking for an answer it doesn't have.
See, even your brain
knows you're screwed.
Your blood is filling
with adrenaline right now...
whether you know it or not.
Your heart's beating fast.
It's getting a little
harder to breath.
Your neurobiological system
is telling you to run,
but your knees are
too weak to move.
And it's... too late anyway.
The pores in your skin
have already opened up.
It's secrete an imperceptible amount
of pheromones into the air.
And all you can think about
is when it gonna kill you.
Senshi!
She sees you, kid.
Attention on deck!
Kitai, back to your seat now.
Rangers, go red-con one.
Secure all cargo!
Behind your seat there's a life-suit.
Put it on now. Strap in,
full harness. -Yes, sir.
Good evening, General.
-Captain.
What's the last known position
of the closest asteroid storm?
Category-4 asteroid formation.
2,000km to starboard
and plus 4-5 declination.
I detected graviton-vibrations
in the hull.
Which you detected, how?
Graviton build-up could be
a precursor to mass-expansion.
That storm could be
on us in minutes.
But, sir, mass-expansion
is one in a million.
If we try to navigate out...
the pull of our own graviton wake
could set the thing off.
Let's just hold course
and hope I'm wrong.
Just out of interest, sir,
How often are you wrong?
My wife would give a very
interesting answer to that question.
Graviton count's decreasing.
800 parts per million.
650.
Well, sir,
there's a first time
for everything.
Turn into it.
Match bearing.
Dad!
She's a dead stick!
Engines 1 and 2
are offline. we losing her!
Can you travel us out of here?
-Where?!
The anchorage on Lycia.
It's the closest.
Negative, sir. We cannot worm-hole
travel in the middle of this.
Do it.
Coordinates for anchorage
at Lycia locked in.
No confirmation signal, sir.
Travel us now.
Sir, without confirmation...
-That's an order.
Go. Go!
Cabin pressure dropping.
Heavy damage to outer hall.
There's a breach possible
to middle cabin.
Find me something I can
land on. Now!
I got something.
Bearing 340 by 95.
Range, 86,000.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Warning: this planet has been
declared unfit for human habitation.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Placed under class-1 quarantine
by the interplanetary authority.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Under penalty of law,</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Do not attempt to land.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Repeat: do not attempt to land.</font>
It's not possible.
The computer might have defaulted
back to a known demarcation point.
No. Not yet.
Travel us again.
-Negative, sir.
This ship is gonna tear apart
at any moment.
Set her down.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Mayday, mayday.
This is Hesper 2-9-9 heavy in distress.</font>
We took heavy damage
from an asteroid storm
and are going down
with bingo power.
You all right?
Evaluate.
Good to go.
You confirm
the Ursa's contained.
The back of the ship is gone.
Rangers, count off.
Rangers, count off.
Damn.
The cockpit is directly above us.
Go.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Left rear.
There's a utility compartment.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Inside,
there's an emergency beacon.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Silver. Like a saucer.
Bring it to me.</font>
Consolidate inventory up.
General Cypher Raige.
Crash landed.
Two confirmed survivors.
Kitai,
the emergency beacon you brought me
will fire a distress signal deep into space.
But it's damaged.
There's another one
in the tail section of our ship.
This is us here.
That, is the tail.
Somewhere in this area.
It's approximately 100km
from here.
We need that beacon.
You understand?
-Yeah.
Both my legs are broken.
One very badly.
You are going to retrieve
that beacon,
or we are going to die.
Do you understand?
-Yeah.
Repeat what I just said.
I have to go retrieve the beacon,
or we going to die.
You have air-filtration inhalers.
You need to take one now.
The fluid will coat your lungs,
increase your oxygen extraction
allowing you to breath more
comfortably in the environment.
You have six vials.
In your weight,
that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.
Your life-suit and backpack
are equipped with
digital and virtual imaging.
So I'll be able to see
everything that you see...
and what you do not see.
I will guide you.
It'll be like
I'm right there with you.
Take my cutlass.
It's the C-40.
Full, 22 configurations.
Kitai,
every single decision you make
will be life or death.
This is a class-1
quarantined planet.
Everything in this planet
has evolved to kill humans.
Do you know where we are?
No, sir.
This is Earth.
And... the Ursa?
There are three possibilities.
First and most likeliest,
it died in the crash.
The second and less likely,
is that it is injured very badly
and still contained.
The third and least likely,
is that it is out.
We will proceed, however,
in anticipation of the worst case scenario.
Every movement will be under
protocol "escape and evade".
If he's out there,
I will see him long before
he gets anywhere near you.
Do you understand?
Yes, sir.
Do exactly as I tell you,
and we will survive.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai, calm down.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Take a knee.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Root yourself in this
present moment, now.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Sight, sound.
Smell.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">What do you feel?</font>
My body feels heavier.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Very good.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Earth gravitational pull
is different than at home.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Very good.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Now, let's go.</font>
What happened?
<font color="#A9F5F2">You didn't see that?
-Kitai, what happened?</font>
I'm fine.
No change, I just slipped.
<font color="#A9F5F2">There's condensation
on the stones.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I'm good to go.</font>
General Cypher Raige.
Initiating remote probe recon.
Primary target:
Ursa.
<font color="#A9F5F2">I want to reiterate that
your navi-band</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">is our sole means of communication.</font>
Roger.
Temperatures in this planet
fluctuate dangerously, Kitai.
And most of the planet
freezes over completely at night.
But there are hot spots.
Geothermal nodes
between here and the tail
that will keep you warm
during the freeze-over.
You must reach one of these
hot spots
each evening before nightfall.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Is that understood?
-Copy.</font>
Standard operating procedure
till I give you further instructions.
Stand by.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, are you there?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Hey, dad, are you there?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Are you there?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Hello?</font>
I'm here.
<font color="#A9F5F2">A boy I know had this.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">It's a real book.
For a museum.</font>
It's "Moby-Dick".
He said I can even
hold on to it.
Hold on, to what?
The book, dad.
Do they really
kill these whales?
We, Senshi, for their oils
and they almost disappeared.
Just before the age
of carbon fuels.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Where's your brother?</font>
Kit.
Hi.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, are you there?</font>
I'm here.
Where are you?
My suit turned to black.
I like it, but I think
it's something bad.
Your suit is made of
smart-fabric.
It has motion sensors.
I'm tracking a life-form
moving towards you from the west.
<font color="#A9F5F2">It's closing rapidly.</font>
50m.
40.
<font color="#A9F5F2">30.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">20.</font>
10.
It is right there, Kitai.
Do not... move.
Recognize your power.
This will be your creation.
Stand down, cadet.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai!
-Go away!</font>
Control yourself, cadet.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai!
Stand down!</font>
Get away!
<font color="#A9F5F2">Get the hell away!
-Kitai!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">To your rear.
Out to your rear.</font>
Okay, I'm going.
There's a river,
250m straight ahead, go.
<font color="#A9F5F2">They are no longer in pursuit.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Cadet, you are not
being followed.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I repeat, you are not
being followed.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai, you are running
from nothing!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai, put my damn
cutlass away.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You are not being followed.
Take a knee.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Take a knee, cadet.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You want to die today,
that's fine,</font>
but you are not going
to kill me.
Kitai, I need you to do
a physical assessment.
You are showing rapid blood
contamination. Are you cut?
I'm dizzy.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai, self-eval.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Good, god!</font>
Dad, I can't stand.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Open your med-kit.</font>
You are going to have
to administer the antitoxin in sequence.
Inject yourself the clear liquid first.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Do it now.</font>
I can't see.
<font color="#A9F5F2">The poison is affecting
your nervous system. Stay even.</font>
Dad, please come help me.
I can't see.
I can't do this without my sight, dad.
Please, come and get me.
Kitai, inject yourself directly
into your heart
<font color="#A9F5F2">with the first stage.
Do it now.</font>
Now the second. ASAP.
To your left, Kitai.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Left!</font>
I can't feel my hand.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, I can't feel my hands.</font>
Press it into the ground.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Roll over on it
and press it into the ground, Kitai.</font>
Great work, cadet.
But you are going
to lie there for a moment.
The parasite that stung you...
has a paralyzing agent
in its venom.
<font color="#A9F5F2">So you are going to have to
lie there for a little bit.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">While the antitoxin
does its job.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">It's time to wake up.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Son,</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">the temperature is dropping
five degrees every ten minutes.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You have got to wake up.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Can you blink your eyes?</font>
Son,
I need you to, please,
blink your eyes.
Blink your eyes.
Hey, dad.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Hey.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">-That sucked.
-That is correct.</font>
You got 9.7km to the hot spot.
How about you show me that
10k in 50 minutes, cadet?
<font color="#A9F5F2">Sir, yes, sir.</font>
Two mikes out. All good.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Who wants to be a ranger?
Who wants it?</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Watch him go.
Watch him go.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Five miles out.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Come on. Lights out.</font>
Happy 19th birthday, Senshi.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, you help me.</font>
No, Senshi. You go ahead.
You blow.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Come on, dad. Blow.</font>
Nah. You know there's no way
I can actually do that from here.
<font color="#A9F5F2">No. I think you can.</font>
Faia, you're right there.
Help the girl.
<font color="#A9F5F2">You can do it.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I love you, dad.</font>
Hot spot one arrival:
H. plus 54 minutes.
Equipment check
and consolidate.
Take your next inhaler.
Your... oxygen extraction
is bottoming.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Take your next
breathing fluid.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Second dose of
breathing fluid complete.</font>
Count off remaining.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Four vials remain, sir.</font>
Repeat.
Four vials remain, sir.
Dad.
Dad.
I'm here.
How'd you do it?
How'd you first ghost?
Out for a run.
Alone.
Something that I
wasn't supposed to do.
Ursa de-camos,
Right in front of me.
I go for my cutlass...
It Shoots its pincer.
Right to my shoulder.
Next thing I know,
we're over the cliff.
Falling.
30m. Straight down.
Into the river.
We settle onto the bottom.
It's on top of me.
But it's stopped moving.
And I realize...
He's trying to drown me.
<font color="#A9F5F2">I'm thinking,
"I'm gonna die.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">"I'm gonna die."</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You cannot believe
this is how you gonna die.</font>
I could see my blood
bubbling up,
Mixing with the sunlight,
Shining through the water.
And I'm thinking, "wow...
"That's really pretty."
<font color="#A9F5F2">Everything slows down.</font>
I see his pincer through my shoulder.
And I decide:
I don't want that
in there anymore.
So I pull it out.
And it lets me go.
And more than that
I can tell...
It can't find me.
<font color="#A9F5F2">It doesn't even know
where to look.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">And it dawned on me...</font>
Fear is not real.
The only place that fear
can exist
is in our thoughts
of a future.
It is a product
of our imagination.
Causing us to fear things
that do not at present
and may not ever exist.
<font color="#A9F5F2">That is near insanity, Kitai.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Now, do not misunderstand me:</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Danger, is very real.</font>
But fear is a choice.
We are all telling ourselves a story.
And that day, mine changed.
<font color="#A9F5F2">14km to the falls.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">That's our midway checkpoint.</font>
I'm reading you.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai, get to the falls. ASAP.</font>
I hear something.
I think it's water.
A lot of it.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Inventory up.</font>
Roger.
Food rations, half available.
Flares, full.
Med-kit, half-available.
Breathing fluid...
Breathing fluid,
four vials available.
Why you're not showing me
the case?
What?
<font color="#A9F5F2">Show it to me now.</font>
I thought that I could make it, sir.
Abort mission.
Return to the ship.
<font color="#A9F5F2">That is an order.</font>
Don't come out.
No matter what.
<font color="#A9F5F2">That's an order.</font>
Help!
Help!
No, dad.
We... I can do it. I can...
I don't need many. I can
get across with just two.
You need a minimum
of three inhalers to make it to the tail.
You have exhausted your resources.
I can get across. I can...
I can do it with just two, dad.
This mission has reached
abort criteria.
<font color="#A9F5F2">I'll take full responsibility.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You did your best.</font>
You have nothing more to prove.
Now, return to the ship.
<font color="#A9F5F2">What was your mistake?</font>
Trusting me?!
Depending on me?
Thinking that I can do this?
Now I'm giving you an order...
to turn around
and return to this ship.
You wouldn't give
any other ranger that order.
You are not a ranger,
and I'm giving you
that order.
What was I supposed to do?
What did you want me to do?
She gave me an order.
She said, "no matter what,
don't come out of that box."
Was I supposed to just
come out and die?
What do you think, cadet?
What do you think you
should have done?
Because, really, that is
all that matters.
What do you think you
should have done?
And where were you?!
She called out for you.
She called your name.
And you weren't there,
cause you never there.
And you think I'm a coward?!
You're wrong!
I'm not a coward!
You're the coward!
I'm not a coward!
Kitai!
Kitai, you've got incoming.
Do you copy?
You've got incoming.
Don't...
Kitai, dive!
Dive!
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai!</font>
No!
Leave them alone!
Get away!
Dad, I'm sorry, it's just...
Where is my son?
General Cypher Raige.
This is a message for my wife.
Faia,
I have lost contact
with our son.
End message.
<font color="#A9F5F2">You have six vials.
In your weight,</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">that should be 20-24 hours
each. That's more than enough.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I estimate four days
to reach the tail.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">We'll break it to sections.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You have six hours to reach
the first geothermal site.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">First leg is 20 km. to the
mouth of the north forest.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I'm right here.
-Five mikes out.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Keep moving.
-That's about one hour.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Take your next inhaler.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">H. plus 54 minutes.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">There's an escarpment.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Looks like it could be
a waterfall</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">We will call that
our midway point.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I can get across.
I can do it with just two, dad.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">14km to the forest.
This is us here.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">That, is the tail.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">You are going to retrieve
that beacon...</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">or we are going to die.</font>
Leave me alone!
Wake up.
It's time for you
to wake up.
Hey.
Hey.
I was just about
to come out that day.
No, you weren't.
But you did the right thing.
Dad says I should have tried.
He's just mad at himself,
that's all.
Why couldn't you ghost?
You're close right now.
I am?
Are you scared?
No. I'm tired.
That's good.
You filled your heart
with something else.
Now you gotta get up.
I memorized some "Moby-Dick".
Kitai, get up.
"All that most maddens and
torments..." -Kitai, wake up!
"All that stirs up the lees of things."
-Wake up!
It's time to wake up.
-"All truth with malice in it."
Kitai! -"All that cracks
the sinews and cakes the brain."
<font color="#A9F5F2">Wake up!</font>
Hey... thanks.
No.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, it's Kitai.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">I made it to...</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Kitai? -Dad, I made it
to the tail, do you copy?</font>
Kitai, I'm here.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Are you okay?
-Dad, do you read me?</font>
I copy.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad, I made it to the tail,
do you copy?</font>
Kitai, we have electrical
interference.
You're in a black zone.
I repeat, you are
in a black...
Dad, the Ursa is not contained.
Please, copy.
Dad?
-I'm here.
I swear to you, I'm here.
Take a knee.
It is the ionic layer.
And the atmosphere
above your current position,
it is causing electrical interference.
That is why the beacon
is not firing.
To your north.
The peak.
You must find the beacon
from the peak of that mountain.
See it, Kitai.
Please.
See it.
Good boy.
Good boy.
Good boy.
It is a pheromone trigger.
He set it to scare you...
so he can track you.
Keep moving.
It has found you.
Run.
Just run, Kitai.
Just run.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Climb in there, okay?
It won't be able to smell you.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Dad!</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Root yourself in this
present moment, now.</font>
<font color="#A9F5F2">Sight, sound.
Smell.</font>
What do you feel?
You're still in that box.
It's time to come out.
Stand me up.
<font color="#A9F5F2">General.</font>
I said... Stand me up.
<font color="#A9F5F2">Watch his back.</font>
Dad?
Yeah.
I wanna work with mom.
Yep.
Me too.
