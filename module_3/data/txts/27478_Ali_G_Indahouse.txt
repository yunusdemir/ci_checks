Me mum washed me yellow top with

All right. But you tell that slag

Will you boys move?

Time to give out this week's badges.
First, big it up
for me main man Andy,
who has finally got
his Hot-Wiring badge
and his Advanced Swearing badge.
- Shit off, you hairy dog's cock.
- Respect.
Since you has got your fifth badge,
you has earned your second slit.
Hopefully one day
you'll get to be Tyrone's level.
lf you gets any better,
we'll have to start doing your pubes.
- l don't have any.
- Well, l is got millions.
Now, remember -
without realness, we is nothing.
So, posse, keep it real!
Keep it real!
On the streets, your homie
would take a cap in his ass for you.
So let's start with
a very basic trust exercise.
- One, two, three.
- Ali, can l have a word?
- Sure.
- lt's about the centre.
l know how much these classes
mean to you
and how much the kids enjoy them.
But the government's withdrawn
our funding.
They're closing down
the John Nike Leisure Centre.
You what? How is these kids meant
to make it out of the ghetto now?
- They'll have to go somewhere else.
- Somewhere else?
Do you know what this centre
means to them? And to me?
This is the spiritual home
of the West Staines Massiv.
This is like what Mecca is
to the Jews.
lt's like what Kentucky is
to chickens.
And it was here when me
first felt me Julie's...
Ali, there's nothing you can do.
Now, you better go and tell the kids.
l ain't never gonna let them
close us down.
Keep it real, yeah?

- 23 points behind.
The youth vote's
deserting us in droves.
Focus groups say we're out of touch.
- We are.
- Don't be silly.
Will we lose this by-election?
We haven't lost Staines in 20 years
and we're not about to start.
We just have an image problem.
We have to find a candidate
who will improve that image.
Somebody young.
- Somebody ethnic.
- Somebody in touch.
- Exactly.
- You're right.
We need an intellectually superior
candidate to guarantee us victory.
- Easy now, Mrs Hugh.
- Booyakasha.

That's a little harsh.
l'm an MP, am l a prick?
- Yes.
- Let's try a different angle.
ls there nothing
you'd like to change?
Me'd wanna save the John Nike
Leisure Centre, obviously.
As the MP for Staines,
you could achieve that.
Would you stand in this by-election?
Me gotta be honest,
me ain't actually bi.
- Well...
- l mean,
obviously l done it with two girls.
Well, l seen it on the internet.
But me would never feel completely
comfortable being bummed by a man.
A lot of people say never say ever
but me feel strongly that me
exit hole should stay me exit hole
and never become me entry hole,
you know what l is saying?
Yes, yes.
Well, it's been
a pleasure meeting you.
David.
Later, sweetheart.
David?
What are you doing? He was
the biggest idiot l have ever met.
- Choose him and we'll never win.
- l know.
There'll be a leadership crisis.
The PM will be out.
And who could possibly replace him?
Ali has two weeks
to lose us 18,000 votes.
Let's get him on the campaign trail.
Easy, rude boy. Me name be Ali G
and me is here representing Staines.
Can me count on your vote?
- Definitely not.
- Hairy muff.
Seeing as l is here,

Ali, would you lay one for us now?
- What, here?
- We would be honoured.
- ln front of everyone?
- Yes.
Not bad.
This is absolutely vital.

Good luck. Don't hold back.
ln the most crucial by-election
of the past decade,
we're joined by ex-Environment
Secretary David Griffiths
and newcomer Ali G.
This debate will help you
make up your mind.
Ali, if elected,
what would you do for Staines?
Me'd save
the John Nike Leisure Centre.
You can't mean your sole policy
is to save a centre that's barely
used and a terrible drain on funds?
What are your other policies?
- My other policies?
- Yes, you must have some.
Well...
l think it is well important
to reduce inflay-tee-on
and also to invest in the nehuss.
The nahuss.
- Oh, the NHS.
- You're reading from my sheet.
No, l ain't. l is thought of them
things meself, you copied from me.
lt wasn't me.
Then perhaps you'd tell me
where you stand on the ERM?
No problem. Me thought
their first album was wack.
Me hate all indie music.
The voters deserve better, you're
making a mockery of this debate.
What? ls you looking in the mirror?
You're making it obvious
to the voters what a buffoon you are.
Talking about yourself again?
l think so.
You are an embarrassment
to the people of Staines.
That is not a nice way
to talk about your mum.
l put it to you that you are
the worst possible candidate
ever put forward
by your miserable party.
Well, l put it to you...
that you sucked off a horse.
l did not, er...suck off a horse.
l have already dealt with this issue
with the party chairman
and as l explained to him,
l was out hunting with a friend
and l slipped onto
the end of a horse's phallus,
which, unfortunately,
owing to it being the mating season,
was aroused.
'Why is he going?
Does he need to go and do a pony?
'ls that a yes or a neigh?
'Why isn't he speaking?

'Was that a lie or the tr-hoof?'

the gallop polls tomorrow!
'More drama with the unexpected

'Tomorrow's vote is now between

Thomas Alvarez,
Liberal Democrat, 5,080 votes.
Alistair Leslie Graham...
Who? What a stupid name.
- 5,086 votes.
- You won! You did it!
And l now declare
Ali G has been duly elected
as Member of Parliament for Staines.

- Haven't you read the papers?
l can't believe it.
This dog can play table tennis.
- lt's the press, they love you.
- But how can he hold the bat?
The Deputy Prime Minister and l
were wondering,
what if l asked you
to join the Cabinet?
No, think about it.
Ali joins the Cabinet,
the two of them are publicly aligned.
Ali slips up,
he takes that old prat with him.
Why would Ali join?
l've told the Prime Minister
to offer to save his leisure centre.
- Are you mad? That would...
- Let me finish.
Offers to save his leisure centre
if Ali gets him a 20-point poll lead.
Now l is in the Cabinet and all,
could l see the red button?
- Can l trust you?
- Yes.
All right. Here we are.
One touch on that red button
could destroy the whole world.
- That is very interesting because...
- No!
Fell for it!
Ali, please, stand away. Dear me.
- Can't we blow up something?
- No!
- Please?
- No.
- Somewhere shitty like Wales.
- Ali.
Their Prime Minister
called your mum a slag.

You shouldn't say that

Your first Cabinet meeting is
Thursday. lt's about asylum seekers.
l'm sending you
on a fact-finding mission.
Anyone trying to smuggle
will probably come through here.
And it's not just immigrants.
Look at this.
You'll be appalled.
Look at this crap.
Marijuana smuggled in from Europe,
South America and the Middle East.
That is terrible.
- ls there any skunk?
- Yes.
Some scumbag
smuggled in 15 kilos of this.
lt's the strongest
super skunk ever discovered.
Over here are the confiscated
weapons and this is where we keep...
You must have such a laugh here.
- No, we don't.
- Oh.
Next we have the mountains
of hardcore pornography,
most of it from Germany.
You may want to look away.
No. l is got a job to do.
l know. lt makes me feel sick, too.
l have to compile me report now,
so if you'd fuck off.
Certainly, sir.
Westminster will be sending down
experts to help with me research.
Hello. We is experts.
'Sprütze in die Arse!'
Ali, tell us,
what did you find out in Dover?
Me saw a lot of stuff,
most of it from Germany,
of these blokes going in
through the back door.
He's right.
ln Germany, l experienced it myself.
- Respect.
- l remember one time
there were these
two huge African men
who managed to squeeze themselves
into...this tiny box.
- How long was they in there for?
- 15 hours.
- lt was incredibly emotional.
- lt must've hurt.
- lt still does.
- Sorry.
So, John, what are we going to do
about these asylum seekers?
We can't let them all in,
it would cripple the economy.
Oooh!
- Yes, Ali?
- Let's think about this.
What's the main thing
we ain't got enough of in the UK?
- Hospitals.
- No.
- Libraries?
- Behave!
We ain't got enough fit women.
And we's got too many mingers.
No offence, Karen.
So we let in all the fit refugees
and turn away the rank ones.
Then we solve both problems.
We is knobbing two birds
with one connie.
- This is ludicrous.
- What do you think?
l think...we should keep it real.

Fit...fit.

l was in a deep hole.
Oh, very deep.
We had some sticky patches
but l'm delighted to say
we came together in the end.

The US will do everything
in its power
to support Chad in its struggle
against its neighbours.
Russia will not allow this
Western oppression to continue
and in order to support
Burkina Faso,

all our military capabilities.
- That's outrageous!
- How can you make such a statement?
Ali, Ali, Ali.

Don't try escaping because this room

You two deserve each other.
Piss off.
Oh, nice!
We're not going to build Terminal 5
