<i>"Thou shalt not kill"</i>
THE MESSENGER
<i>Henry V of England and Charles VI
of France sign the treaty of Troyes.</i>
<i>It says that the Kingdom of France shall
belong to England upon the King's death.</i>
<i>But both kings die
within months of each other.</i>
<i>Henry VI, but a baby, is the new king
of England and France.</i>
<i>Charles VII, Dauphin of France,
will not abandon his kingdom to a child,</i>
<i>nor to his tutor, the Duke of Bedford.</i>
<i>Bloody war breaks out,</i>
<i>the English and their Burgundy allies
invade France.</i>
Is anybody there?
Jeanne...
I'm always happy to see you
but to keep coming 3 times a day...
I need to confess.
You already did this morning.
I need to confess again.
What is this terrible sin
that can't wait till tomorrow?
I saw a poor monk without shoes...
so I gave him some.
There is no sin in charity.
They weren't mine.
Whose were they?
My father's.
He'll forgive you.
He already did,
but I want Jesus to forgive me too.
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time
we'd spend our life in church.
Is that bad?
Well no, but...
Are you happy at home?
Yes... very.
Everything's fine with your mother?
Yes, she's... wonderful.
You sister Catherine
is still your best friend?
My sister's just...
She's wonderful!
And your other friends?
You don't like
playing with them?
I play with them.
Lots!
So everything sounds "wonderful".
Yes, it is.
Why do you come so often?
I feel safe here,
where I can talk to him.
"Him"?
I try to talk to him,
but he does most of the talking.
Who is this...
"he"?
He never says his name.
What...
does he... look like?
Beautiful.
What does he say to you?
He says...
He says I must be good,
and help everyone,
and take care of myself.
Is he coming from the sky?
Perhaps.
Wherever he's coming from,
I think you should
listen to him. It sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.
It's... wonderful!
<i>Jeanne...</i>
Mother!
Catherine!
Jeanne!
Did they hurt you?
No, I'm fine.
Where were you?
The English are everywhere!
I was with the priest.
You know what he said to me?
Tell me later. Hide in here!
Where'll you be?
Right here... I promise.
Well, that's what I call booty!
A woman with a sword!
Look at this!
Frenchmen are such cowards
they have women fight!
If that's God's will,
then so be it.
Fine with me. I love women.
Hold still, bitch!
Stop wriggling about!
Your turn now.
God bless the soul of this departed.
Keep us safe
from fear and sin.
Listen, Jeanne.
You will stay with your aunt
and uncle for a while.
Just to give us time
to rebuild things.
You understand?
Lord, teach us always
to love this land and to save it
from those who seek to destroy it.
Goodnight.
What'll happen to her?
She'll be fine.
She'll grow up, find a man,
have children.
Don't worry.
She'll survive.
Tomorrow,
she'll be as right as rain.
You'll see.
I want to see a priest.
Why did she have to die?
Only God can answer that.
Jesus says to love your enemies
but I can't.
I want the English to burn in hell
for ever and ever!
I realise your anger,
but we must learn
to forgive.
Revenge will never
bring about peace.
Then what will?
What will bring her back?
Why did she have to die
instead of me?
Why didn't he take my life?
It's my fault. I was late,
she gave me her hiding place.
Why did He save me?
Calm down, Jeanne.
I don't pretend to know God's will,
but one thing I am sure of:
the Lord always
has a good reason.
Perhaps he chose you
because he needs you
for some higher calling.
So, as long as you answer that call,
your sister will not have died in vain.
I don't want to wait for His call.
Be patient.
I want to be with Him always!
Soon you'll be able
to take part in the Holy Mass.
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood,
you will be at one with Him.
I want to be at one with Him now!
So what did he say?
We must bring her to church
whenever she wants.
Easy for him...
He's not doing the bringing!
This is important.
We mustn't let her out of our sight.
Don't worry.
I'll watch her
like my own shadow.
I want to be at one with You now!
A message for the Dauphin of France.
Captain,
a message for the Dauphin.
I'll take it.
The Dauphin!
Louis!
Shouldn't you be studying?
No, I want to fight!
You will.
But first, learn to wipe your nose.
A letter for His Majesty.
Another one from this
"Maiden of Lorraine"!
I can read, you know.
She pretends to be sent by God.
Charlatans! And not enough
wood to burn them all...
She'll be here tomorrow.
Don't see her, my Lord.
Who knows if she's really from Lorraine?
What difference would it make?
If she comes from Burgundy,
it might be a trap.
"Signed X".
What sort of a name is "X"?
A messenger of God
can't even write her own name?
Trémoïlle is right.
She says she hears voices.
She may be a witch!
Regnault!
You see witches everywhere.
She's just a peasant.
A peasant who... cares about her king.
All she wants is to see me crowned
and to fight for me.
No. She wants you to give her
an army at your expense.
Since your mother stole
most of the Treasury,
I fail to see
how you can afford this.
I can see her if I want to.
As the English hold half of France,
what have I to lose?
The other half.
You mustn't see her.
She may be an instrument of the Devil.
I think you should.
How amusing! I'd love to know
why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing
and my two most loyal advisors
think precisely the opposite.
Because I care about you.
Come here.
Your health and happiness
have been my priority
ever since you were a little boy.
I know you better than your mother.
You think so?
I know the sickness
that plagues your heart,
how painful it is to have loved
a father, without knowing
if he was really yours.
Do I know you enough?
What's that got to do
with this Maiden?
Who better than a messenger from God
to give you answers?
You think she was sent from God?
You're a fine judge of character.
You'll soon expose her
if she's a fake.
But... if she's not,
she'll give you your answers
and your crown.
I think it's going
to take more than a peasant...
I don't care what you think
or even what I think
but what simple people think!
Up and down the country
they are already talking about her.
Simple people are always ready
to believe any old prophecy.
Like this one.
About a virgin from Lorraine
saving France.
And now,
this girl comes along...
from Lorraine.
And there's a spark of hope
in their simple minds.
We shouldn't disappoint them.
If they believe in her
to put back the fire in our army,
then I believe in her too.
Stop, Louis!
Be quiet for once!
- She's coming, your Majesty.
- Alright.
Calm yourself.
I urge you not to see her.
It reeks of a Burgundian trap.
For my astrologers, the timing is good:
Leo, with Virgo rising.
On the astrological chart,
the virgin is next to the lion.
Supposing she's an assassin?
My dear Trémoïlle,
I'm not even king yet.
Who would want to kill me?
She's in the guards' room!
Fine.
I suppose
I'll have to make a decision.
Why is life so complicated?
Sometimes I wish
I were someone else.
Good idea, Sire.
What do you mean?
Let someone else pretend
to be you, and see if...
If she can find me?
Brillant idea!
If she's sent by God,
she will guess.
If not, she will kill the wrong man.
Brilliant!
Please!
We're going to play a little game.
Now, let us pretend
that my throne is empty.
Just pretend!
Who wants to be king?
There's a heart-warming sight!
Now let us see...
Which one of you
could possibly pass
as the King of France?
Alençon...
My noble duke, my royal cousin,
so fine, so rich...
Far too rich
to be the King of France.
Everyone knows
I'm the poorest in my kingdom.
Gilles de Rais, Marshal of France...
Formidable to men,
fascinating to women,
feared by all.
You'd be perfect to sit on my throne.
So perfect,
that you might like it too much
and disturb
my fragile peace of mind.
La Hire, my angry captain...
The bravest in France.
Scarred by 12 wars,
but with a heart for 12 more.
You could pass for the king.
Damn bloody right!
But no one with a tongue like that
could pass for King of France.
Seems it'll have to be me after all.
Why not you?
Jean d'Aulon!
The only man
who's poorer than I,
so the only man I can trust.
Dignified, honourable, wise...
What more can we ask of a king?
I'm not sure that...
You're not ready to die
for me?
Of course I am.
Until then, live like a king!
Bring her up!
Sire,
I am bad at this sort of game.
Pretend it's not a game.
- Mother...
- Not now!
I've come to see the Dauphin.
Who are you?
I'm...
His most gracious Majesty
Charles de Valois,
Dauphin of France.
I can see you are a good man,
but you're not the Dauphin.
Sorry to insist,
but I must see him.
We've no time to lose, where is he?
He's here.
Find him yourself.
Now you'll see
who'll pass for a king.
There's no need to be afraid, Sire.
I'm not the King.
I know you're not yet,
but you will be soon.
Out!
How did you know?
- Her "voices"!
- They said:
"The one in the corner
with a big nose."
Oh, my gentle Dauphin!
I have a message
from the King of Heaven.
For you!
You only.
Follow me.
Trémoïlle,
I know I can count on you...
As always, Majesty.
...to ensure our privacy,
I need to talk to her alone.
He needs to talk to her alone.
Fine.
I was about ten.
On a sunny spring day,
I was walking home
when a strange wind
began to blow.
It was such a strange sound,
almost like words,
calling me.
The second time
was many years later.
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly,
the same...
violent wind...
Then,
a shape
appeared
in the middle of the sky.
The shape...
of a man.
Everything was moving so fast.
The wind, the clouds...
I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.
I was so... afraid.
He was...
so...
here!
Then I knew God had chosen me,
but I didn't understand
what my mission was.
What could I do?
Help my country but how?
I was just a poor girl!
I didn't know anything
about making war or riding.
So I decided to wait
and not to speak of it
- to anybody.
- You did well.
I didn't wait long.
I was going to Mass,
like I do every day,
when the same...
strange wind...
Everything was made clear.
God had given me a message.
A message to deliver.
What was the message?
He said,
I must save France
from her enemies
and bring her back
to the hands of God.
And He told me that I...
Jeanne,
will lead you to the altar at Rheims,
where you will be crowned
the King...
of France.
- Sire...
- I'm fine.
Jean d'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.
Jean, I put her in your care.
Find her suitable lodgings
in the castle
and guard her with your life.
No lodgings
if we're to march on Orléans.
It has held out for 6 months,
a few days won't make a difference.
Take some rest.
Put the bags here.
Forgive me for pretending to be...
May I have some water?
Water? Yes, of course.
- Anything else?
- A priest.
Now?
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Anything else?
I shall also be needing
a new war horse, a sword,
armour and an artist to make a banner
- for me.
- Now?
Better today than tomorrow.
This might take a little time.
I'll see what I can do.
And someone who can
read and write.
I can. I was studying in Paris
until the English invaded it.
Aren't you an archer?
Yes, I am.
Who can read and write.
Who is the letter for?
The King of England.
To give him the chance
to leave in peace,
before I get to Orléans.
The Archbishop and I are negotiating
to bring the Burgundians
over to our side.
Negotiate,
but from a position of strength.
If the English take Orléans,
the whole country will be theirs.
My Lady,
it would be folly to let this... child
lead our army in the King's name
without verifying her true motives.
Trémoïlle is right.
We must be certain
that she isn't
an instrument of the Devil.
How can anyone
be absolutely certain about anything?
Intuitions may be our best counsellors.
We must listen to our Church
before our intuitions.
Wait!
She claims to be a virgin.
That we can examine
and be absolutely certain about.
Let's find out.
What if she's not?
If she's not,
I'll kill her myself.
There is no sign
of corruption or violation.
She is intact.
What exactly was this "vision" wearing?
I don't remember.
Did it give you anything,
an object, a ring, a rosary,
anything by which
we can verify your claim?
He gave me good advice.
As a child,
did you have any military experience?
Can you wield the sword?
No, but I'm good with a stick.
Do you know what a Dijon Culverin is?
No.
An item of artillery.
How do you expect to free Orléans
if you don't know?
The road to Orléans is long.
I have good captains with me.
I'll learn fast, believe me.
We would like to, Jeanne.
But if God wanted us to believe you,
he would have sent a sign
with you...
So, can you do something?
Show us something?
A sign
to prove that you are sent by God?
I didn't come here to perform tricks.
You are all much cleverer than I am.
Me, I don't know A from B,
but this much I do know:
while the people in France
lie bleeding,
you sit around in fine clothes,
trying to deceive me,
when you're only deceiving yourselves.
You say you are men of God,
yet you do not see
His hand guided me
through 500 leagues
of enemy country
to bring you His help.
Is that not proof enough?
Do you still need more signs?
Give me an army.
Take me to Orléans.
There you'll see the sign
I was sent to make.
Dunois!
What?
A big one! Straight at us!
What side?
Window side.
Dunois!
What?
Good news!
Finally he's sending her to us.
Thanks be to God, we're saved!
It's wonderful!
Calm down, Xaintrailles.
Who's done what?
The Dauphin is sending us
supplies and an army,
led by Jeanne,
the Maiden from Lorraine.
Isn't it wonderful?
Yes, it's a miracle.
They're sending a woman!
What colour dress will she wear?
Blue.
With a ribbon to tie up Talbot.
Does she even know how to ride
a horse?
She knows.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Yes, they were.
Where are the English?
Everywhere. The food?
It's coming. I rode on ahead.
I have a message
for the English Captain.
- His name's Talbot.
- I know.
Can you take me to him?
He's on the other side of the river.
Who ordered
my being brought to this side?
My friend!
Good to see your ugly damn face again!
- La Hire, don't swear!
- Sorry, Jeanne.
Let me introduce the King's
half brother, Lord Dunois.
Will you show me to the other side?
Wait...
Go now if you want, but not with me!
You serve God,
but I serve my people,
who are starving!
I'm taking the food back to the city.
Calm down,
come with me to Orléans,
and I will welcome you.
Jesus Christ!
- The goddamn English will pay for this.
- They will.
So will you, if you go on swearing.
Welcome to my tavern.
Come on in.
La Hire,
Gilles, come and see!
The Tourelles are here...
Calm down!
You can't blame them.
- They've heard about you.
- There's nothing to hear.
Because I haven't done anything.
And why?
Because no one listens to me!
Why don't you join us.
We're about to discuss the campaign.
So from here, Talbot
has spread his forces
between these forts.
But our scouts saw some troops
deployed to this fort.
What about this huge pile?
That's the Tourelle.
They planned to attack from it,
but we destroyed the bridge.
I did!
It should keep them quiet for a while.
Now my hunch is:
the attack will come from St Loup.
And what does Jeanne think?
I don't think.
I leave that to God.
I'm nothing in all this,
I'm just a messenger.
So?
What is the message?
We give the English...
a last chance to go home
- in peace.
- If they refuse?
If they refuse...
we recross the river
and attack
here!
At the Tourelle.
That makes no sense!
The Tourelle is impregnable.
And if we are on the other side,
who will stop Talbot attacking
- from the north?
- God.
God! Why, of course!
We'd forgotten about him.
I feel great sorrow for you.
You laugh, but by tomorrow,
some of you will be dead.
We can't just attack the Tourelle
like that.
- It's a complicated matter.
- Why?
You only need to do what you're told.
What could be simpler?
I'm the drum on which
God is beating out his message.
So hard it's bursting my ears!
Jeanne, it's not easy for us,
for our pride,
to suddenly be usurped by...
with all due respect, by a...
by a girl.
So, that's it.
To you, I'm just...
a girl.
Put yourself in my shoes.
How would you feel?
Knowing what I know?
Enormous gratitude.
One hell of a girl!
I warned you!
I do love her
when her fire gets well and truly
- stoked.
- Me too.
Hello, my friends!
What a journey!
But we made it.
Let's have some fun.
Fine. Let's look like a man.
Stop it!
How dare you stop God's will!
He never said cut your hair!
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!
Since He won't cut it Himself,
let someone do it properly!
Raymond, bring the scissors.
Louis, fetch
the mirror.
Stop getting so angry.
- Calm down.
- I am calm!
But God is angry.
I need to send a letter.
Now!
Fine.
<i>To you, Henry, King of England,</i>
<i>and you, Duke of Bedford,
who call yourself Regent of France,</i>
<i>obey the King of Heaven,
abandon your siege.</i>
<i>Give back the keys to the other towns
and go back to your island.</i>
<i>To you, Lord Talbot,
I beg you as humbly as I can,</i>
<i>for the sake of your soldiers' lives.</i>
<i>Do not bring about your destruction.
Surrender to me,</i>
<i>Jeanne the Maiden,
sent here by God.</i>
Message!
<i>But if you refuse, we shall raise</i>
<i>such a battle cry as there</i>
<i>hasn't been in France for 1000 years.</i>
Sire, a message.
<i>This is my third and last letter to you.</i>
<i>If still here at noon,
you will hear from me,</i>
<i>to your very great destruction.</i>
<i>Please, reply speedily.</i>
Go fuck yourself!
What did they say?
They will think about it.
Good.
But I don't think
they'll leave tomorrow.
I can't wait for tomorrow!
French blood is spilling!
Wake up!
Hurry!
They've started without me!
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won!
Sound the retreat!
My banner!
Open the gate!
What happened?
- Who ordered the attack?
- God knows.
- Bad idea.
- Were the men confessed?
- Where are the priests?
- Left behind, to gain speed.
Dunois, was it your order?
Answer me!
- Later.
- Sooner is better than later.
Wait!
You'll be killed!
Follow me
and I will give you victory!
Close it!
Close the drawbridge!
To the drawbridge!
What is she doing?
To the drawbridge!
- It's closed!
- Not for long.
Let's go!
That's mine!
It's a great victory, Jeanne.
Your victory.
But we must
pursue the English
back to Talbot's camp.
Unless you have a better idea.
We find the biggest army we can
and return
- to Orléans.
- The bridge was pulled down.
The English are rebuilding it.
How do you know?
You've been with your council,
I've been with mine.
Come on, hurry up!
Careful with my baby!
That's the Tourelle.
Wonderful!
Captain!
The froggie whore's paying us a visit.
I'd better tell Glasdale.
Put the horses there!
Fathers,
please bless them.
Bless them all.
Let's plan this attack more carefully.
Good idea.
Sire.
We've got... visitors.
Glasdale!
Do you hear me?
You call me a "whore",
I feel pity for you, for your soul,
and the souls of your men.
Yield!
Yield now to the King of Heaven!
Or go back to your island!
And you, go back to your pigsty!
Man the walls.
This morning,
God gave us a great victory.
But it's nothing
compared to what He'll give us now.
I know you are all tired and hungry.
But I swear to you
that even if the English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips,
we will pull them down by nightfall!
Let all those who love me
follow me!
Follow me!
You were saying?
I'll go right.
I'll go left!
Come on!
Get that fucking thing moving!
You're beautiful!
But are you powerful?
- Xaintrailles, do something!
- What?
I don't care!
Fire!
Fire!
Fuck!
Too high.
Reload!
Get out of here!
You're gonna get killed.
Get out of here!
Bring the culverin!
Get out!
- Jeanne!
- Leave me alone!
Come on!
You just killed my woman!
Captain!
Go to hell!
Call the physician!
Damn it!
Go find the physician.
Let's take the arrow out.
No, she'll bleed to death.
There must be something we can do!
Yes, you can pray.
Good idea.
I swear...
I'll never swear again
if You save her life!
But if You let her die,
You're a goddamn...
Don't swear.
He heard me!
Why aren't you fighting?
You're badly wounded.
No, it's nothing.
It's an arrow.
And it's in deep.
The physician will be here.
Waste of time!
You'll have more luck with this charm.
It saved my life at Azincourt.
I'd rather die than use magic!
You will if the arrow stays in.
At least,
this one won't bother us anymore.
Now, let's go to the battle!
Please!
She's nuts!
You must stay calm and rest.
I will but you have to promise...
Promise me...
you'll go back to battle.
I promise.
Hurry!
Quickly! Do something!
She's sleeping.
Come back!
Why are you running away?
- Jeanne is alive.
- Good.
- We must press home the attack.
- Sound the retreat.
I promised to fight on!
I didn't.
Sound the retreat for the night!
But it was her order!
I'm fed up with taking her orders!
She swore to defeat the English,
and instead,
she plays the fool
and gets herself nearly killed!
Look at the mess we're in!
That's hers, not mine!
It's worse than if she'd never come!
Now do as I say
and sound the retreat!
Where are you going? Come back!
What are you making?
A message for the English.
So what are the men saying?
She's a gift from God.
Some even call her a saint.
I'd gladly follow her
- through Hell.
- That far?
Of course.
I've been there before.
What I don't understand,
if she's been sent by God,
why does He allow her
to be wounded?
So, maybe the good question is:
"Is she really sent by God?"
Who knows?
God knows.
A woman with a sword!
Catherine!
You've hurt my feelings!
Frenchies!
What happened to your precious angel?
Frenchies, frenchies!
I'll tell you what happened.
We sent the little bitch back to Hell
so she can go fuck with the Devil!
What are you going to do now?
Why not come out...
and fight? Come on!
Come on, bastards. Wake up!
Or are you too busy praying
to bring your little fucking witch
back from the dead?
Do you hear me?
I hear you!
I'm alive!
May God forgive your blasphemy...
for I never will.
I never will!
What are you doing?
You must rest!
We must wake up the soldiers, now!
My fine soldiers, wake up!
To arms!
Wake up!
We must fight the battle!
My fine soldiers,
the battle has begun!
Wake up!
To arms!
The time has come!
La Hire...
To arms!
My soldiers, we need this tower up.
We need this tower up now!
My soldiers, help me.
What's going on?
We're taking back the Tourelle.
Ready?
Go wake up Glasdale.
What are you doing?
Sending a message to Glasdale.
- With that?
- Yes.
But you've got it back to front.
I know what I'm doing,
so lend us a hand or go back to bed.
I'm sending a message to Glasdale too.
My Lord...
What?
The French witch...
she's back from the dead.
Hurry up, men!
Shouldn't we take some time
and think about this?
Sooner is better than later!
To arms!
Xaintrailles!
Good morning!
Good morning!
This one.
What is she playing at?
I don't know.
I don't know what she's doing now!
We can't plan anything
if she doesn't consult with us!
Did you consult with her yesterday?
Don't start.
You agreed to attack.
That doesn't count.
Why not?
Because I always agree to attack.
To arms!
Crazy bitch.
She doesn't even know how to use it.
Oh, my God!
Fuck! Close the doors!
Close the doors!
Glasdale!
Open the door!
Load the porcupine.
Pull!
Glasdale!
Pull!
Hurry up!
Never wait for miracles.
Stay there.
French whore, come and get me!
Come and get me!
Come here!
What are you waiting for?
Alençon!
Find your archers.
Burn that door!
Right away!
Let's push!
Prepare the gate!
Position!
Fire!
Water!
Fire!
Oh, my God!
Kill her.
Reload.
More archers.
Perfect.
More archers!
Help me!
Get your men
and make a battering ram.
Already done!
What?
Nothing...
Help me with this man, please.
As you command.
What are you doing?
Opening that door.
Isn't that what you want?
Out of my fucking way!
Fill the cauldron!
What do the fucking French
know about me?
Reload!
Fill the fucking cauldron!
Come on!
More men, more men!
More men!
Ready?
Pull the oil!
<i>What are you doing, Jeanne?</i>
I'm playing.
<i>What are you doing to me, Jeanne?</i>
Do you hear me?
Are you alright? Do you hear me?
Calm down.
It's over.
We won.
We won?
Fucking bitch!
Jeanne, my friend!
My soldier!
In my arms!
- We won?
- Won?
No. Such a small word will never do.
This is victory!
This is glory!
What's the matter?
This is glory?
This blood...
This is not possible.
This is not possible!
This is not possible.
This is not possible.
You look disappointed.
Isn't this what you wanted?
Not like this!
For weeks you've been asking for this.
Now you have it.
What are you doing?
Nothing...
Just taking his teeth.
You can't kill a man for his teeth!
Why not?
He has good teeth!
Because... Because you can't!
What about all this?
That's different.
We were fighting for a cause!
Not me.
He's my prisoner.
I can take his teeth if I want to.
No! You can't!
Stop it!
Here, take this.
He's mine now.
Here, you! Go!
Bravo! Do we let
the other prisoners
- go too?
- I don't know!
Maybe.
We must confess.
We need to be confessed.
All of us.
I know this isn't normal custom, but...
Everything's gonna be fine.
He's going to confess us.
Kneel. Kneel.
Alençon brings bad news.
Thousands of English are forming up
across the river.
We should count our men
and get ready.
Let's go!
I'll go.
Alone.
I have a message for your King Henry.
It is a message from God.
Go home!
Go now in peace!
If you do not go now,
you will be buried in this field!
I've seen...
enough blood!
But if you want more,
I can't stop you.
I can only warn you
that it will be your blood.
Not ours!
I'm waiting for your answer.
Never wait for miracles.
Stand by to attack.
Please...
My Lord...
Please...
That's a goddamn bloody miracle!
On her white horse alone,
facing the whole English army,
she drove them away.
Orléans is free.
We lost Orléans.
I want that girl.
I want that girl...
burned.
May I see the seamstress?
It's too tight.
That's meant to be a crown?
- Anything more regal?
- The English took the real one.
I forgot how good it looked
when cleaned up!
Did you clean up
what's inside as well?
I asked for a grandiose coronation,
this is going to be an utter fiasco!
We only had 3 days.
It took 3 months for your father!
He's right, let's delay it.
We can't, Sire.
The English might come back.
Let them come
and see the true King of France!
Damn English!
We should be in Paris,
in Notre-Dame.
Prestigious and twice as big!
It's the sacred place that matters,
not the size.
Yes, my Lady.
A true King of France
must be anointed
in Rheims with the Holy Oil of Clovis.
Your Grace!
There can be no anointing!
What are you talking about?
The Holy Oil of Clovis is all gone!
Impossible. It's a magic oil.
Miraculous. It can never be exhausted.
- Look for yourself.
- Problem?
I don't understand.
It was quite full
the last time I saw it.
When was that?
For the coronation of Charles VI.
30 years ago?
Does it surprise you it's gone?
You don't understand.
It's no ordinary oil.
It's a miraculous oil.
Brought by a white dove from Heaven
to crown King Clovis in this very...
What are you doing?
Performing a miracle.
With this sacred oil
blessed by the hand of God,
we do anoint thee,
Charles Valois,
to be Sovereign, Lord and King
of this great
Kingdom of France,
charging you to defend the faith
of our Mother Holy Church
as long as you shall live.
Are you alright?
Yes, I'm fine.
Why are you staring at me?
You have an arrow in your leg.
So there is.
But that doesn't stop you from climbing.
Come on! Go!
Raymond!
Take this arrow out.
Look out!
Be careful!
The men are exhausted.
So is the enemy.
Paris is ours.
We are not enough.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Reinforcements? Where?
Right behind us.
Dunois with another 10,000 men!
Look behind you.
Never look behind. Only ahead.
Do you know how to count?
Of course I do.
So bring them up!
That is not 10,000 reinforcements.
That is 100 very loyal
but very tired soldiers!
But where is Dunois
and the men the King promised me?
He never sent them.
Don't you understand?
He doesn't want this war anymore.
He has his crown now.
That's all he ever wanted.
But my voices... they promised me...
To Hell with your voices!
It's time to face facts!
We have nothing to do here.
None of us...
Not even you.
You don't believe in me anymore?
Of course we still believe in you.
If it were up to me,
I'd chase the English into the ocean.
But it's not up to us anymore.
It's up to the King.
You should go home, Jeanne.
We can't afford the size of army
she's demanding.
The girl is crazy.
The victory in Orléans was a miracle.
But we can't wait for a miracle
building a future for France!
Paris was a disaster.
God was not with her then.
If God deserts her,
what should we do?
Why did you betray me?
Paris was ours for the taking.
- Why did you take the army you gave me?
- Gave you?
I wouldn't put it that way...
How would you put it?
We are, of course,
enormously grateful
for your past efforts
but now your task is done.
Now is the time for negotiation.
Only fighting will get peace
from the English.
Why are you so bloodthirsty?
Do you enjoy it?
Diplomacy is far more civilised...
far safer... and far cheaper.
I have letters from towns under siege
where people are starving,
begging God to help them.
I'm here to answer their prayers
and you want to stop me?
France does not belong to you, Charles.
She belongs to God.
If only she would just go home!
What shall I do?
What do your voices say?
They haven't spoken to me
since the coronation.
No signs... Nothing.
Maybe their silence is a sign.
A sign to go home.
It's not time yet.
My mission isn't over.
So much I have to do!
How do you know
these voices are not just...
really you?
Well... they are me!
That's how God speaks to me.
You could hear them
if you listened.
It sounds so simple!
Even you
don't believe in me anymore.
I believe in you... more than anyone.
I just wish I could...
help you.
There's one thing you can do for me.
Tell me.
Tell the King to give back the army
he gave me.
You have to stop her.
If her own army attacks
the Burgundians at Compiègne,
my months of negotiations
will have been in vain.
Jeanne has done so much for us.
The Maiden has a great admirer in me
but we cannot allow her
to conduct her own
private war.
For the kingdom,
stop her going to Compiègne.
I can't stop her.
If you don't, I'm sure the Burgundians
will be happy to oblige.
- If they capture her at Compiègne...
- No one can blame us.
But... it could sound like
we betrayed her.
No, never!
Don't worry, Charles.
If God is still with her,
she will be victorious.
Her army's much smaller...
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
What are you doing? Open up!
I'm protecting my town.
But...
Take my banner.
My Lord...
My Lord!
I can't believe it.
Your romantic vision of death,
grass growing everywhere.
You have a big imagination.
But maybe not big enough.
Death is much more...
simple.
After a few months,
it gets more interesting.
Then, after a year,
it finally becomes...
romantic.
Who are you?
You don't like my face?
You prefer this one?
Too young maybe?
How about this one?
Better, no?
But...
incomplete.
Get thee behind me, Satan!
How are you to tell the difference
between good and evil?
Are you God?
I'm just a messenger.
He needs me.
How can you imagine that God,
the creator of heaven and earth,
of all life,
could possibly need you?
I don't know.
Can't He deliver his own messages?
What do you want from me?
I'm here to set you free.
Smile! You have visitors.
The Duke of Burgundy!
Here is Jeanne, saviour of Orléans,
terror of the English.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Your king?
Yes, of course.
What will he pay with?
Cows? Chickens?
I prefer gold.
And the English have plenty.
How much will they pay
to have the Witch of Orléans?
They won't accept to be defeated
by a peasant girl.
It must've been the Devil's work.
God defeated the English.
And let you be caught?
I don't believe in God.
Or in the Devil either.
That's why I'm never disappointed.
Sell her...
For the ransom.
All the Captains gave money,
the people in Orléans too.
It's very generous of you.
How much?
10,000 gold crowns.
10,000?
That's a lot.
Your Grace, I place you in charge
of this negotiation.
Get yourself ready, you're leaving.
Who are you?
Pierre Cauchon,
Bishop of Beauvais.
The duty of conducting the trial
falls upon me.
Trial?
What trial?
Your trial, Jeanne.
On a charge of heresy.
But... my king...
Didn't he pay my ransom?
Seems the English
care more about you.
The English?
They paid your ransom.
Tomorrow you're going to their castle
in Rouen.
Our Majesty Henry VI,
King of England and France,
has placed her in our hands,
accused of heresy,
to be tried in a matter of faith.
On the Holy Gospels,
swear to tell the truth
for every question.
You may ask me things
I don't want to answer.
Swear to tell the whole truth.
I will tell the truth
about all earthly things.
But as for my revelations,
I've told no one but my king.
Charles VII,
the one and only King of France.
Not even a king would refuse
to take the oath
to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
I'll tell you all I'm allowed to say.
As for the rest, even if you threaten
to cut off my head,
I won't tell you.
Tell us your name.
Are you allowed that much?
My name is Jeanne.
My cross was taken from me.
May I have it back?
Cooperate first.
Where were you born?
In a village in Domremy.
How old are you?
19... or thereabouts.
Were you baptised?
Yes.
Recite Our Lord's Prayer.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully.
We are all men of faith.
We shall strive for the salvation
of your body and your soul,
in the name of the Church,
who welcomes those who return to her.
But we cannot help you
unless you submit to our authority.
Take heed of this admonition.
If you persist in refusing our help,
we shall have to abandon you
to the secular powers
and the punishment that you know.
So now...
will you recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Not unless
you hear my confession.
Be careful! It won't help you to refuse
to submit to our judgment!
And you who claim to be my judges,
you be careful!
You too shall be judged!
Clear the room!
In future we should proceed
away from public pressure.
Let them burn her.
Why should we get involved?
It's our duty to root out
heresy wherever we find it.
Father Vincente,
what do you think?
This trial is a masquerade,
and I won't be part of it.
I'll be her judge,
not her executioner.
Of course!
The verdict comes
at the end of a trial, Cauchon,
not at the beginning.
I'm returning to Rome to give my report
to our Holy Father the Pope.
This is ridiculous!
Now I'm the one
who's being judged!
Arrest him!
What are you doing?
This is an ecclesiastical court!
This is English territory.
I have every right.
Is that clear?
Our father who is in heaven...
Why were you yelling?
What are you doing here?
You can't stay.
Go away!
Why?
Are you waiting for someone?
Yes!
Who?
My visions.
Your visions?
They'll visit you here?
Yes, that's what I pray for.
I want to see that.
Do you mind if I stay?
I won't bother you.
No, you can't, you can't...
- or they won't come!
- Why not?
I have to be alone.
They won't come.
- What do you mean?
- Why would they?
Because
I've always been faithful to God
and I've done
all He's ever asked me to do!
God asked you to do something?
Yes, lots of things!
You mean God said:
"I need you, Jeanne"?
No,
but... he sent me signs!
Signs? What signs?
The wind...
Wind?
And the clouds ringing...
Ringing clouds...
The dance...
The dance...
The sword lying in the field.
That was a sign.
No, that was a sword in a field.
No, that was a sign.
No, that was a sword in a field.
It can't just get there
by itself.
A sword just doesn't
get there by itself.
True!
But there are many ways
a sword might find itself in a field.
That's a valid explanation.
How about this one?
But there are other possibilities...
Or even faster!
That's without counting
the inexplicable.
Yet, from an infinite number
of possibilities,
you had to pick this one.
You didn't see what was,
Jeanne.
You saw what you wanted to see.
This "voice" that you say
appears to you,
is it an angel?
Or a saint? Or God?
I won't tell you any more about that.
I'm afraid of displeasing Him.
You're afraid of displeasing God
by telling the truth?
Did God forbid you
to tell the truth?
My revelations were
for the King, not for you.
When you saw your king
for the first time, was there
- an angel over his head?
- If there was one, I didn't see it.
Why did he believe in you
without proof?
Go and ask him.
Dinner.
When you were taken prisoner,
did you have a horse?
Yes, a half-steed. Black.
- Who gave it to you?
- My king.
How many did he give you?
Five... steeds and... a few hackneys.
As much as for a lord.
What an honour!
Did he give you other wealth?
Did he not give you silk dresses?
Yes, I was given a few.
But I never had time
- to wear them.
- Pretty wealthy for a peasant girl!
And you look pretty wealthy
for a servant of God!
You launched an attack on Paris,
didn't you?
I tried to.
To make the city surrender
in the name of the King of Heaven?
No, in the name of the King of France.
That is not what is written here.
Look for yourself.
I can't read.
Yes, I forgot!
God chose an illiterate peasant
for an important mission.
Do you think God
was right to take
an ignorant girl to save France?
I leave that answer to God.
Calm down, my Lord, I beg you!
When the whole court laughs at me?
She's smart
but we're making progress
every day.
So long as she's alive,
my armies won't fight.
They need proof
that God is on their side.
It's your prerogative to burn her.
Yours is to find her guilty.
But we need her to admit to blasphemy.
What are you waiting for?
You have all you need
to torture the bitch.
You won't get her to talk that way.
And besides,
several of my colleagues are...
scared.
Scared? Of a girl?
Scared to make a mistake.
Suppose she's right?
Suppose she's been sent by God?
Whose side are you on?
On the side
of Holy Mother Church.
Do you have a sword?
Quite a few.
And a banner?
Did you prefer
your banner or your sword?
I was more fond of my banner.
Why?
Did it have some value or power?
No, it's just...
a sword is a weapon.
And?
And... so I... prefer my banner.
Why?
To avoid killing anyone.
You mean that without your banner,
you'd have killed more people?
No, of course not...
I never killed anyone.
Perhaps the temptation to kill
would have been stronger...
Too strong perhaps?
I begged them to leave.
Why didn't they listen to me?
Some witnesses say you were
not always carrying your banner.
Yes... Perhaps.
You had just your sword?
Yes. I don't know...
Did you use that sword?
Yes, I did... I held it up.
You held it up in the air
like this?
I don't remember.
You were in the battlefield
waving your sword
above your head,
charging against the enemy,
yelling,
and fighting for your life,
and you want us
to believe that
in the middle of this excitement,
you never killed anyone.
No, I never killed anyone!
You're lying.
I'm not! I can't remember.
I never killed anyone.
Let me help your memory.
That's enough.
I didn't kill that man.
Leave me alone!
Stop. I can't remember.
It was so confusing.
I was just defending myself
as best I could.
So much dust and noise.
They were all around me...
so, maybe I fought back
but it was only
- to defend myself.
- Now you remember.
- Yes.
- Good.
Now you tell me
why God let all those battles happen.
He's so powerful.
He created heaven and earth.
He could have stopped
that blood and misery.
Why didn't he?
Is He the one who spread
this blood and misery?
But he could have stopped it.
Did He get pleasure...
from watching us killing each other
in His name?
In His name?
Yes! In His name.
We fought and killed in His name,
the King of Heaven!
Let all who love me follow me!
"Let all who love me follow me"...
Where does God get mentioned?
Come on, Jeanne,
be honest.
You fought for yourself, in your name.
I was defending myself
as best as I could!
Everyone has the right to!
Or should I let myself get killed?
No, you did fine.
I'd even say well done.
As a matter of fact,
most of the ones you killed
probably deserved it.
No! I never thought killing
each other would bring peace.
I agree.
Peace will only be got with a lance.
I don't agree.
You keep changing your mind.
And you, why...
are you doing this to me?
Does hurting me give you pleasure?
"Pleasure" is difficult to define.
When does pleasure take over pain?
When did your pleasure begin
with that sword in your hand?
I never took pleasure
in hurting anyone!
Really?
Set me free!
You will be, Jeanne.
You will be.
Jeanne, my dear friend in Christ,
we, your judges, desirous of reaching
a lawful verdict,
submitted a transcript of your trial
to the University of Paris.
The learned scholars have concluded
that you have committed
many grievous sins,
and here is their opinion,
as detailed in these articles.
Article One:
"You said that God commanded you
to wear men's clothes,
"and to wear your hair short,
"with nothing to distinguish you
from soldiers..."
Don't abandon me.
Where are you?
Is this what You want?
You want me
to burn
without being confessed?
Finally, Article Twelve:
"You refuse to submit yourself
to the judgment of the Church,
"but only to God,
"which shows
that you have no comprehension
"of the authority of the Church,
and that you've erred
"in the faith of God,
that you're a child of superstition,
"an idolater,
"and a heretic!"
We once again
admonish, beg and exhort you
to cast out
your erroneous beliefs
by signing this recantation.
If the Church
wants me to say
that my visions are evil
then I don't believe in this Church.
Perform your office!
Wait!
I beg of you, sign!
Don't you understand?
I'm trying to save you!
I want to be confessed.
Sign this,
and I'll confess you.
And may I...
may I go to Mass?
As often as you like.
For the love of God, sign!
Sign!
Sign and you will be free
of your chains.
You know what you just did?
You denied His existence.
For you,
He's a lie,
an illusion.
No, he promised to confess me.
In the end, it was you
who abandoned Him.
May I have it back?
You have nothing to regret.
Give it back!
Take her away!
She has recanted
and we accept her repentance,
for the Church always welcomes
those who repent.
Now, she's your martyr,
not ours.
Enough!
Here.
If you want to get dressed,
try these for size!
My Lord Bishop!
Come to see for yourself?
Take a look.
You see?
Dressed as a man again!
Her repentance didn't last,
did it?
The Bishop of Senlis
witnessed her evident relapse.
By what miracle
did these clothes get here?
Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon...
an evil spell!
This girl is a witch,
and she will burn for it!
Prepare the stake
in the market place.
I don't understand.
Why did you do it?
And you? Why did you lie?
You promised to confess me.
It was to save you from the fire.
It's not my body I want to save.
It's my soul.
I ask only one thing.
Please, hear my confession.
I can't, Jeanne.
I can't hear your confession.
I'm very sorry.
You want to confess?
I'm listening.
I've committed sins, my Lord.
So many sins.
I saw... so many signs!
The ones I wanted to see.
I fought.
Out of revenge and...
despair.
I was all the things that...
people believe
they are allowed to be
when they're fighting for...
a cause.
For a cause?
I was...
proud...
and...
stubborn.
Selfish.
Selfish.
Yes, cruel.
Yes, cruel.
You think you are ready now?
Good.
<i>Jeanne d'Arc was burnt on May 30th 1431
at the age of 19.</i>
<i>She was canonised by the Vatican...</i>
