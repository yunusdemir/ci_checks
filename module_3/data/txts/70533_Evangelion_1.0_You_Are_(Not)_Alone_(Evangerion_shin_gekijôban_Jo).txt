Evangelion New Theatrical Edition: Prologue
How can I not find him now of all times?
Oh, man...
Due to the current state of emergency,
all phone lines have been suspended.
No good, huh?
My cell phone has no signal,
and the buses and trains have stopped running...
There's no way we'll be meeting here.
Oh, well. I might as well head to a shelter.
All missiles have hit the target!
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
The target is still intact.
It is continuing its advance towards Tokyo-3.
Aerial units are unable to slow its advance!
Throw everything at it!
Mobilize the 4th rear armored division to intercept!
Don't hold back!
Destroy the target at all costs!
How!? Those were direct hits!
The tank battalion was completely destroyed.
Our guided missiles and artillery have no effect.
Damn it! We won't get anywhere with this level of firepower!
As we thought, an AT-Field...
Yes, conventional weapons are useless against the Angels.
Yes, sir.
We'll proceed according to plan.
No way...
They're using an N2 Mine?!
Get down!
- We did it!
- I'm afraid you won't be needed this time.
Shock wave incoming.
Are you alright?
Yeah, I just have some dirt in my mouth.
That's good to hear.
Are you ready?
And... push!
Thanks, l couldn't have done it without you.
l should be thanking you, Katsuragi-san.
Misato is fine.
Let's start over:
It's nice to meet you, Ikari Shinji-kun.
Yeah.
What is the target's status?
- Unable to confirm due to...
- You saw that massive explosion.
- ...electro-magnetic interference.
- It was obliterated.
Recovering image.
That was our ace in the hole.
- What the hell is this thing...
- Goddamn monster!
Thank goodness the Renault is still running!
I only have twelve more payments left on it.
It would be awful for it to suddenly be out of commission.
I've gone ahead and requested an express rail,
so it looks like we'll make it in time yet!
You don't ask many questions, do you, Shinji-kun?
No.
It's only been me talking this whole time.
Sorry.
You don't have to apologize...
But don't you want to ask me,
"what the hell was that big thing from before,"
or, "what in the world's going on here," or something?
Well, I sort of thought you wouldn't tell me anything, anyway.
Being extra suspicious, huh?
That's very grown-up of you.
I'm fine. Everything is just as my teacher told me, isn't it?
I see. Well, that's fine.
But just so you know, what that was before is an unknown life-form we call an "Angel."
The Fourth Angel.
It seems to have the ability to restore damage to its body.
The Angel has evolved towards its own state of completion,
and is nearly an ultimate form of life.
It is not surprising.
Beings that have eaten the Fruit of Life.
Yes. They exist to destroy us,
those who have eaten the Fruit of Wisdom.
The gate is now closing. Please be careful.
Secret Agency Nerv?
Yes. It is a private organization under the direct supervision of the United Nations.
My father works there, doesn't he?
Sort of. Do you know what he does?
"Work of utmost importance in the protection of humanity."
That's what my teacher says.
As of now, you are in command of this operation.
- Show us what you can do.
- Understood.
Ikari-kun, it's clear our weapons are unable to disable the target.
Are you confident you can succeed?
It is why Nerv exists.
- Are we going to my father now?
- Well, yes. We are.
Father...
Oh, do you have the I.D. your father gave you?
Yes.
- Here.
- Thanks.
"Come." - Ikari Gendo
Here, please read this.
Nerv... My father's work.
Is there something I'm needed for?
Of course. He wouldn't have written me for nothing.
I see... You don't get along with your father.
Neither do I.
Amazing!
A real Geofront!
That's right. This is our secret base:
Nerv Headquarters.
The fortress that protects humanity.
The key to rebuilding the world.
Let's see...
After exiting the station's west entrance,
take a right at the third north gate and you'll arrive at Route-8.
They certainly went out of their way to make this facility confusing, didn't they?
This should be the right route...
Um, are we lost?
I'm still not used to getting around here...
But let's just keep on going and we'll get there eventually!
Secondary cooling stage complete.
All work personnel exit at once.
You'll only have 3 minutes to finish thawing the right arm conduction compartment.
Don't forget to take down the apoptosis data as you go.
Roger.
A report for Dr. Akagi Ritsuko:
We have confirmed Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi of First Command Division and other
have now arrived at shaft S-36.
Incredible. She's late again.
Ah, Ritsuko!
You're 12 minutes late.
l was coming to fetch you,
Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi.
- We're short on both time and manpower.
- Sorry!
- ls this the boy?
- Yes.
I am Akagi Ritsuko, Chief of Nerv's E-Project, Technical Division.
It's nice to meet you.
Yeah.
I'll leave the rest to you.
Meeting his son after 3 years...
Vice Commander, the target has begun moving once more.
Understood.
All hands to Stage One Battle Stations.
I repeat, all personnel begin Stage One battle arrangement.
Prepare for surface intercept.
Ikari Shinji-kun, there's something I want to show you.
The Ultimate All-Purpose Decisive Battle Weapon:
The Artificial Human Evangelion.
This is Unit-01.
Mankind's last trump card.
This is my father's work?
Correct.
It's been a while.
Father...
Prepare to sortie.
Sortie? But Unit-00 is still grounded!
- Unless... You intend to use Unit-01?!
- There is no other choice.
- Ikari Shinji-kun.
- Yes.
You will pilot it.
Father... Why did you send for me?
You know why.
I'm just supposed to pilot this and fight that thing outside?
Correct.
No, I won't! Not after all this time!
You didn't need me, isn't that right?!
I called for you because I need you now.
Why me?
Because no one else can.
l can't do this...
I've never even seen this before!
How am l supposed to do anything?!
You will be instructed.
That... That's impossible!
There's no way l can pilot this!
If you're going to pilot it, do it now.
Otherwise...
Leave here!
The bastard's found us.
1st Stratum, 8th Armored Layer has been destroyed.
Shinji-kun, we don't have much time.
Widespread fires in Block-D.
Closing all fire doors in the area.
Pilot it.
No... After coming all this way...
This is ridiculous!
Shinji-kun, why did you come here?
Don't run away. From your father,
and above all, from yourself.
l know that! But... l can't do it!
Fuyutsuki.
Wake up Rei.
- Can we use her?
- She isn't dead.
Understood.
- Rei.
- Yes?
The spare is useless.
You must do it again.
Yes, sir.
Convert Unit-01's core unit configuration to
L-00 Type and prepare to re-activate!
Roger. Discontinuing current operations.
Preparing restart.
Initiating re-activation.
l knew it...
I'm not needed after all.
Are you alright?
I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away,
I mustn't run away, I mustn't run away.
I mustn't run away!
I'll do it. I'll pilot it.
Level 3 cooling cycle complete.
Flywheel rotation stopped. Connection disengaged.
- Auxiliary power level stable.
- Signal terminator plug has been ejected.
Roger. Inserting entry plug.
Unlocking spinal conduction system. Preparing connection.
Probe insertion complete.
Psychological contamination level maintaining within
safe range of +02 to -05.
Interior array locked down.
Affirmative. Initiating Stage One contact.
Flooding entry plug.
What is this?!
Don't worry. Once the LCL fills your lungs,
it will provide oxygen directly to your blood.
You'll get used to it.
- Main power connection complete.
- Affirmative.
- Initiating Stage Two contact.
- Establishing interface.
No abnormalities detected in A-10 Nerve connection.
LCL charge levels normal.
Set the thought configuration to Japanese.
Initial contacts nominal.
Communication line open.
All clear through task 1405.
Synapse readings:
Synchronization rate, 41.3%.
Without a plug suit? Amazing...
Harmonics are all normal.
No disturbances identified.
This will work!
Prepare to launch!
Prepare to launch!
Release primary lock bolts!
Release confirmed.
Disengaging the umbilical bridge.
Release secondary lock bolts!
Removing primary restraints.
Removing secondary restraints.
Safety systems 01 through 15 disengaged.
Disengagement confirmed.
Unit-01 is free.
internal power supply has been fully charged.
No problems detected in external power source connection.
Roger. Transporting Eva Unit-01 to launch pad.
All linear-rail startup adjustments functioning normally.
Electromagnetic induction system operational.
Unit-01 moving to K-52.
Launch sequence now in progress.
Eva ready at launch pad.
The course is clear. All green!
Launch preparations complete.
Understood.
l have your approval?
Of course.
If we do not defeat the Angels,
there will be no future for us.
Ikari, are you truly okay with this?
Launch!
- Are you ready, Shinji-kun?
- Y-yes.
Release final safety lock!
Evangelion Unit-01, lift off!
Shinji-kun, just concentrate on walking.
Walk...
It walked!
Walk...
Shinji-kun, stay focused!
You need to get up right now!
Shinji-kun, calm down!
That's not your arm it's holding!
- How is Eva's defense system?
- I'm not getting a signal.
- The field isn't developing.
- It's not active?!
- Left forearm damaged!
- Circuit disconnected!
Shinji-kun, move away!
- Frontal cranium fracturing!
- Its armor won't do much now...
- Skull cracked! Severity unknown!
- Operational integrity compromised!
Status?!
Synchrograph inverting!
Neural pulse flow is reversing!
Cut the circuits!
No good! The shutdown signal is being rejected!
What about Shinji-kun?!
No response from the monitoring system.
Life signs unknown!
Unit-01 is completely silent.
Misato!
It's come to this...
Halt military operations!
The pilot's life is our main priority!
- Eject the entry plug!
- We can't! We've lost all control!
What?!
- Eva has re-activated!
- That's impossible! It should be immobilized!
- Has it gone...
- Berserk?!
We've won, haven't we?
AT-Field!
It's pointless. If the Angel maintains its AT-Field...
Eva won't even be able to touch it!
- Left arm restored!
- Unbelievable!
Unit-01 is expanding its own AT Field!
Angel phase space is being neutralized!
It's not neutralizing it. It's corroding it.
Eva broke through the Angel's AT-Field so easily...
What is Eva's status?
- That is Eva's...
- True nature.
Have you decided on a name?
If it's a boy, Shinji. If it's a girl, then Rei.
Shinji... Rei...
Shinji... Shinji... Ayanami...
Shinji... Rei... Rei...
Ikari... Rei...
No... Ayanami...
Rei!
A ceiling I've never seen before...
The attack of the Fourth Angel and its subsequent destruction.
The acquisition of the Third Child,
and the first activation of Eva Unit-01.
All went as was predetermined.
Except for the enormous cost to repair Unit-01.
Quite trivial compared to the grounding of Unit-00.
We've completed the recovery of Eva Unit-01.
It is currently locked in Cage 6.
An inspection is set for 10:00.
What about the data record of its berserk period?
It was blank. Nothing was recorded.
Findings inconclusive, right?
Its application as a weapon is...
Way too volatile.
So long as it can combat the Fifth Angel,
minor inconveniences are acceptable.
No need for concern.
Following the deployment of Unit-01,
Unit-02 and its pilot are now undergoing
field evaluation in Germany.
Make sure construction of Unit-03
and the others proceed according to plan.
Overseeing Nerv and Eva with discretion is your primary duty.
Do not disappoint us.
Indeed. Exterminating the Angels is but one step towards
fulfilling our covenant with Lilith.
The Human Instrumentality Project.
Its execution is our ultimate goal.
I understand.
Everything shall proceed according to Seele's scenario.
The collapse of the Angel's AT-Field
was more destructive than we predicted.
This blood is like a lake from hell...
It reminds me of the Second Impact.
It makes me feel sick.
For Eva to defeat the Angels.
That's the only hope humanity has left.
It looks like our hope-burdened pilot just woke up.
Paging Dr. Ugai of First Internal Medicine.
Dr. Ugai.
Please contact Dr. Azuma of the First Surgical Department.
Alone?
Correct. He's been assigned quarters in Block-6 close to here.
- I assume that isn't a problem.
- No, sir.
Is that really okay, Shinji-kun?
It's okay, I prefer being alone.
It's always the same wherever I am, anyway.
What?!
Like l was saying, Shinji-kun will live with me.
Besides, I have authorization from above.
Don't worry, it's not like I'll have my hands all over him.
That goes without saying!
Just what are you getting at?!
- You're always so...
- You can never take a joke.
Alright, it looks like we have to celebrate tonight!
Celebrate what?
The arrival of a new roommate, of course!
So you've decided to move?
Yes. We never thought this city would become a battlefield.
Who would? My husband wants me and our children to evacuate, too.
l heard that there were more than
100 moving notices today alone.
That's hardly surprising.
This may be a fortress city,
but you still can't count on Nerv to keep you safe.
l get chills just thinking about what happened yesterday.
l know...
We're going to make a quick stop on the way, if you don't mind.
Where to?
Someplace really cool.
It's kind of... desolate, isn't it?
It's time.
Amazing! The buildings are coming up from the ground!
This fortress city was built to intercept and defeat the Angels.
Tokyo-3.
This is our city.
And the city you protected.
I think your things have already been delivered.
To be honest, I've only just moved here myself.
Alright, come on in.
Uh, pardon the intrusion...
Shinji-kun, this is your home now.
I--I'm home.
Welcome home.
It's a little messy in here,
but don't let it bother you.
She calls this... "a little"?
Oh, sorry, but could you put the food in the fridge?
Sure!
Ice... Snacks...
And nothing but beer?
What kind of life does she lead?
- Bon Appetit!
- Bon Appetit.
This is what makes life worth living!
Not hungry?
For instant food, it's pretty good.
Well, I'm... just not used to this sort of thing.
No way! l won't stand for fussy eaters here!
No, that's not what l meant!
l just...
Pretty fun, huh?
Sharing a meal with someone else, I mean.
Yes, ma'am.
Since this is your home now...
You don't have to be so polite!
Yes ma'am...
Yes ma'am, yes ma'am...
You're so uptight!
You're a boy aren't you?!
Show some backbone!
Yes, ma'am.
Well, whatever.
Go take a bath and wash all your cares away!
Bathing is the laundry of life!
Misato-san!
What is it?
Oh, him? He's a hot-spring penguin.
It's a type of bird.
Those penguins really exist?!
There were a lot of them 15 years ago.
His name is Pen Pen.
l came across him one day,
and now he's my other roommate.
More importantly, shouldn't you be covering yourself?
Was that on purpose, I wonder?
Or maybe I'm the one whose being too obvious...
Katsuragi Misato-san...
She's not a bad person.
Bathing is laundry of life!
In here, more bad memories come up than others.
How did Rei seem?
You went to hospital at noon, didn't you?
There are no problems.
Restarting Unit-00 is our first priority.
How is your son?
l imagine his mental state is rather unstable.
Leave him be.
Rather, his condition gives us a pretext to reinstate Unit-00.
We'll proceed according to
Lieutenant Colonel Katsuragi's proposal, then.
Without a preliminary report, they suddenly elect the Third Boy.
As if in response, the Fourth Angel attacks.
And Commander Ikari's son is conscripted by force.
It all seems like a conspiracy.
And yet, despite defeating the Angel, I feel surprisingly...
Unhappy.
Another ceiling I've never seen before...
No surprise...
Nothing about this city is familiar.
This is your home now.
Why am l even here?
Shinji-kun? I'm coming in.
I forgot to tell you something...
You did a good thing.
And people will thank you for it.
You should be proud.
Good night, Shinji-kun.
Hang in there.
Sorry, new kid, but l have to punch you.
I just won't be satisfied if I don't.
Sorry. His little sister was hurt in that big incident the other day.
This is just how it is with him.
It's not like l pilot that thing because l want to.
Where are the people who will thank me...
If it was such a good thing to pilot Eva,
why am I getting hit?
- Are you ready, Shinji-kun?
- Yes.
Within each Angel is something called a core.
Destroying that core is the only means to kill an Angel.
So, center on the target, and pull the trigger.
Do this enough, and it will become second nature.
Yes.
Very good. Continue practicing in induction mode.
Yes.
Shinji-kun sure has brought himself around to piloting Eva, hasn't he?
He does whatever people tell him to do.
It's how he goes through life.
Center on target, then pull the trigger.
Center on target, then pull the trigger.
Center on target, then pull the trigger.
Center on target, then pull the trigger.
l heard Shinji-kun was hit by a classmate on his first day at school.
Is the pilot security detail working out alright?
There's no problem with the Intelligence Service's surveillance.
Besides, he wasn't hurt that bad.
It's better we stay out of his private life.
Doesn't he live with you?
His care is your responsibility too, you know.
All the more reason. It's... difficult.
He's more naive than I thought.
Is that a complaint?
You were the one who was so adamant about taking him in.
Shut up...
Well, Shinji-kun doesn't seem like
the sort of person who makes friends easily.
Have you ever heard of the Hedgehog's Dilemma?
Hedgehogs? The little prickly things?
For hedgehogs to share their warmth with one another,
the closer they get,
the more they hurt each other.
People are the same way.
A part of Shinji-kun is afraid of that pain,
so he stays away from others.
Well, eventually he'll understand.
As you grow older, you become close with and grow apart from others
until you know the right distance to avoid that pain.
I suppose you're right.
Still, when are we going to get budget approval to upgrade Section-B here?
Eva's maintenance and weapons are their main priority.
Maybe they ran out of money?
My butt is freezing...
An emergency call. I'll go on ahead.
We have made visual contact of inbound object.
- E-747 has also confirmed the object.
- Analysis indicates Pattern Blue.
There's no doubt. It's the Fifth Angel.
- All hands to Stage One Battle Stations.
- Roger! Readying city's ground-to-air intercept.
Initiating Tokyo-3 into combat formation.
Retracting central block.
Central block and districts 1-7 retraction complete.
Government and related agencies have been notified.
Target steadily progressing.
Air defense systems currently operating at 48% capacity.
Status of noncombatants and civilians?
Reports confirm they have already been evacuated to shelters.
Students in grades 1-9,
please remain with your homeroom class.
Residents...
- Damn, this again!
- Nothing but scrolling text again?
It's an information blackout.
They won't show us regular citizens anything.
Even though this is such a big event.
What a waste of taxpayer money.
Some people just have to fire off some ammo.
The Japanese Government is requesting we launch an Evangelion to intercept.
How annoying. It's not like we weren't going to, anyway.
Entry plug start-up.
LCL electrification complete.
Releasing pressure lock.
Father isn't even watching me...
Why am l here doing this again?
I'm only making people hate me...
- Hey, can l talk to you in private?
- What about?
- Just for a second.
- Alright...
- Yeah, that's what I thought.
- Hey, Class Rep.
- What is it?
- We gotta take a leak.
Jeez, you guys had plenty of time earlier!
So, what's this about?
- Before l die, I want to see at least one of them.
- The battle up there?
This is the real deal!
And who knows when the next enemy will attack?
Kensuke, what's wrong with you?
If I miss this chance, I might never get another!
So, come on... Just help me open the gate.
Okay, okay.
You're a real slave to your passions, aren't you?
Shinji-kun, are you ready for launch?
Yes.
Remember.
Neutralizing the enemy's AT-Field will require rapid, simultaneous fire.
- Just like in practice. You'll be fine.
- Okay.
Launch!
Incredible! This was worth the trouble!
And just in time!
There he is...
- AT-Field expanded.
- Center on target, then pull the trigger...
- We'll go according to plan, okay Shinji-kun?
- Yes.
Idiot! The smoke is concealing the enemy!
Woah, he's getting creamed!
He's be okay.
We're sending you up a spare rifle!
Take it!
Shinji-kun? Shinji-kun?!
Oh man... I wonder if that hit really knocked him out.
Sh--Shut up!
Umbilical cable has been severed!
Eva switching to internal power!
Active time remaining,
4 minutes 53 seconds and counting!
It's coming this way!
Shinji-kun, are you alright?! Shinji-kun?!
Damage report?
Damage minimal. Eva is functional.
- Shinji-kun's classmates?
- What are they doing there?!
Why isn't he fighting back?
Because we're here...
He can't move!
Unit-01 will reach active time limit in 3 minutes 28 seconds!
Contact surface melting.
Damage at 58%.
Shinji-kun, let those two into the cockpit!
Once they're in, return to base!
We'll regroup later!
You two, get in! Now!
- What? There's water!
- LCL electrification complete.
- My camera, my camera!
- Entry plug restarting.
Contact surface meltdown has reached 3rd protective layer!
Now! Retreat!
Take Recovery Route 34.
Head for the mountain's eastern side...
Hey, new kid, she said, "run away!"
New kid!
I mustn't run away!
Progressive Knife equipped!
Shinji-kun, listen to me.
Fall back now! Shinji-kun!
That idiot!
Unit-01 will reach active time limit in 30 seconds and counting.
28, 27, 26, 25,
24, 23, 22...
13, 12, 11, 10,
9, 8, 7,
6, 5, 4,
3, 2, 1!
- Eva Unit-01 has ceased all activity.
- The target has completely collapsed.
- Why did you ignore my orders?
- I'm sorry.
l am your commanding officer, am l not?
Yes.
When I give you an order, it is your duty to carry it out.
Do you understand me?
Yes.
Make this the last time.
Okay.
ls any of this getting through to you?!
Yes, l understand, Misato-san.
But it doesn't matter, does it? We won.
If you tell me to pilot Eva, I will.
Isn't that enough?
Enough of this.
Go home and get some rest.
Next stop is Nagao-touge. Nagao-touge.
Please exit to the right.
That's right! Cheap as they come!
Hot young girls ready to give you the best service!
Come on down and recharge your batteries!
He has no intention of coming back.
That idiot.
Ikari? Ikari Shinji?
Absent so soon after transferring here...
Well, regardless, let's look over your previous test.
Enough of this...
Just take me back to Misato-san!
Did wandering around for days cheer you up, Ikari Shinji-kun?
Not really. Nothing I did really helped.
Nothing ever does.
l don't have any freedom anyway.
I have to pilot Eva regardless, don't I?
It's why father sent for me.
l don't mind. I'll do it.
If that's what everyone wants, that's what I'll do.
What everyone wants...?
What do you want?
l know l can't do this.
l know everyone thinks so, too.
But Ayanami is hurt, and you and father want me to--
That's enough!
This has nothing to do with anyone else!
You alone decide whether you continue to pilot Eva.
If you want to leave this place, fine.
It's all up to you.
Do as you please.
Your son has acted exactly as planned it seems.
Yes. Next we will move him closer to Rei.
The plan has not changed.
A scenario written out 14 years ago...
These children's fates have already been decided.
Isn't it much too cruel?
C'mon, don't hold back! It's alright, go for it!
I won't be satisfied, if you don't do it.
Well, seeing as he's so sincere, I'd go for it.
Now we're even!
I'm sorry I hit you, Ikari.
Go for it, Kayoko!
If you lose, you're buying us pizza!
- Go, go!
- Don't stop!
Come on, give it to me again!
Jeez, the guys are eyeballing us!
Perverts!
Suzuhara has a weird look in his eyes.
You're so cute, Ikari-kun!
Ayanami Rei, age 14.
She was the first candidate chosen by the Marduk Institute.
The First Girl.
Exclusive pilot of Evangelion prototype Unit-00.
All records regarding
her past have been erased.
And to save her, my father...
Critical error in activation system!
- Failures in Stage Three routines!
- Nervous system elements rejected!
Circuits misfiring! System unstable!
Neural pulse flow reversing!
I'm unable to stop it!
Direct monitoring disrupted!
Entry plug in unstable depths!
It's being drawn further into Eva!
Halt all contacts.
Emergency shutdown of circuits 1 through 6.
It's no good, the signal isn't getting through!
We have lost control of Unit-00!
- Abort the test. Cut all power.
- Yes, sir.
Unit-00 has switched to auxiliary power.
35 seconds to total system shutdown.
Failsafe system has yet to activate.
It's too dangerous! Please step back!
- Automatic pilot ejection system engaged!
- No!
Quickly, release the bakelite!
Rei!
Total system shutdown in 10 seconds...
8, 7, 6, 5,
4, 3, 2, 1.
Unit-00 has ceased all activity.
Rei, are you alright?!
Rei?!
Good.
Hard to believe all that happened.
Official records of the event might have been purged,
but it's all true.
If Unit-00 went berserk,
why the rush to restart it?
Isn't it a bit soon?
Another Angel attacked so soon.
Combat readiness is our top priority.
I suppose that's true...
We've already run re-activation tests with Rei.
There are no problems with Unit-00 itself.
If we can complete neural calibration, that is.
Immediate re-deployment... right?
l wonder why Ayanami is always alone...
Eva Unit-00 entering third freezing phase.
Please shutdown all systems up to phase three in Cage-06.
No problems with latest harmonics and synchronization tests.
- All numerical values satisfied.
- Roger. Reporting results to Balthazar.
Roger. Sending total range of entry plug's personal data to Melchior.
- Melchior, roger. Circuits connected.
- Third freezing cycle starting.
Sending Casper's current data to Melchior.
T-minus 150 minutes to Unit-00
conductive systems restart and testing.
Roger. Routine synchronization test,
Program 508 is now complete.
Thank you, Shinji-kun. Good job.
- So, what's it like living with him?
- Not too bad. I'm getting used to it.
Still a little Nervous?
You've lived with a man before, haven't you?
It's not like 8 years ago.
"Love" isn't involved this time...
I wonder... Shinji-kun chose to stay because of you, didn't he?
You're wrong.
I think... he stayed because of his father.
He just wants his father to acknowledge him.
To pat him on the shoulder.
To give him a word of praise.
l think he wants only a little affection to wipe away his loneliness.
Hung up on his father...
Just like you.
l wonder why Commander Ikari acts so distant with his own son.
And he talks with Rei...
It's a terrible balance.
Men these days are so egocentric.
It's a tough time to be a woman,
isn't it?
Well., then..
It's about time I head back.
A worker bee as usual.
Misato, take these with you if you're going home.
It's Shinji-kun's official security card,
and Ayanami's renewed card.
l haven't had a chance to give it to them myself.
Could you have Shinji-kun give it to her tomorrow?
Yeah, sure.
Ayanami Rei.
Why was father smiling with her?
Why won't he smile for me?
Excuse me...
Hello? It's me, Ikari.
Ayanami, I'm coming in, okay?
Are these Ayanami's?
Um, l...
l didn't mean to...
Could you move?
Uh, I...
What is it?
Well, l just came here to...
Because l... l was asked to...
What was it...? Right, the card!
Your card was renewed, and l was supposed to...
So... So... I wasn't trying to...
Ritsuko-san said she forgot to give it to you, really.
l rang the doorbell,
but no one answered.
It was unlocked, so l...
Central Dogma is currently open.
Group 3 is asked to use direct entryway 4.
This is your new card, Ayanami.
Ritsuko-san asked me to give it to you.
- I'm sorry about what happened.
- What happened?
Aren't you afraid, Ayanami?
To... pilot Evangelion again?
Why would l be?
l heard you were badly hurt in that test before.
So l was just curious...
If you were worried or not.
l see. I'm not worried.
But it might go berserk again.
Or an Angel could kill us.
You're Commander Ikari's son, correct?
Don't you have faith in him?
In the work he does?
Of course not! Not in a father like him....
Object proceeding past Odawara Defense Line.
Unidentified Object analysis complete:
Pattern Blue.
Target confirmed as an Angel.
As we thought. The Sixth Angel.
Yes.
Launch Unit-01 to intercept.
Ready Eva Unit-01 for launch!
Equipping with anti-air ordnance.
Target currently above Lake Ashinoko.
Eva Unit-01 is ready to launch.
Launch!
High energy reaction detected inside the target!
What?!
ls it going to--
Take cover!
- Lower synchronization rate to its minimum!
- Deploy protective armor!
Abort intercept!
Begin emergency recovery of Unit-01!
It's no good! The catapult has melted!
It's not functioning!
What about Eva's AT-Field?
It's fully expanded, but it's barely maintaining!
No! No, I can't!
Let me out! Let me out, father!
We're breaking military protocol!
The pilot's life is our main priority!
Eject the entry plug!
You can't.
With the pilot gone, Eva's AT-Field would completely collapse.
The situation would only get worse.
But...
There's no other choice...
Initiate forced recovery of Eva!
Blow the explosive bolts!
Target has ceased fire.
Recover Unit-01!
Re-route to emergency care cage!
Alert the rescue squad!
- Cool the entry plug's LCL to its highest level!
- Pilot confirmed! Heartbeat is very weak!
Set plug suit life support to maximum!
Begin heart massage!
Yes, ma'am!
- Pulse confirmed!
- Jettison entry plug!
- Emergency LCL purge!
- Yes, ma'am!
Purging LCL.
Treat him, quickly!
The target is currently above the Geofront, drilling down to us.
So, he's attempting a direct attack of Nerv Headquarters...
All right, each department report your findings.
Judging from the previous battle,
the target seems to fire automatically on any enemy within a certain range.
Close-quarters combat is a no-go then...
How's its AT-Field?
Active. To make matters worse,
its phase pattern is constantly shifting.
Neutralizing it will be very difficult.
According to MAGI calculations,
the amount of N2 mines necessary to breach the target's AT-Field
is so massive, that Nerv Headquarters would also be destroyed.
MAGI-2 in Matsushiro has made the same conclusion.
The Japanese government and UN forces are petitioning we do just that.
l wonder if they'd say the same if they were in our shoes.
If Nerv Headquarters falls, it's all over.
Even so, the drill has already breached the 2nd layer of armored plating.
It's already begun penetrating the 3rd layer as we speak.
From here on, it will have to pass through 22 layers total.
It's expected to reach Nerv Headquarters tomorrow morning at 06:54.
That's 10 hours, 14 minutes from now.
To make matters worse, Unit-00 is still not battle ready...
Unit-01 also requires extensive repairs to be operational.
The outlook appears to be rather bleak.
We're short on everything, it seems.
Should we wave a white flag?
Maybe so... But there's something else I'd like to try first.
The Intelligence Service has access to JSSDF confidential materials, don't they?
Well, you've certainly drafted quite a reckless plan,
Operations Chief Katsuragi.
Reckless? How rude.
It's possible to execute in 9 hours,
and it's our best shot.
Operation Yashima...
Draw all of Japan's electricity,
and direct it into a commandeered,
top secret, experimental JSSDF high power positron rifle.
Because it's incomplete and not tuned for remote use,
Eva is required to fire it.
Convincing the UN forces is one thing,
but there's the Ministry of Home Affairs and the JSSDF, too.
Well, they do owe me a few favors.
It takes a thief to catch a thief, right?
As of midnight tonight, the entire country will suffer a large-scale blackout.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
l repeat, as of midnight tonight,
the entire country will suffer a large-scale blackout.
- Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
- Alright. Here goes.
l repeat, as of midnight tonight,
the entire country will suffer
a large-scale blackout.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
The Angel has penetrated through the 7th armored plate!
How's our power system?
Power will be fed from the New Gotenba
substation and two backups.
Superconductive cable is currently being laid towards Mt. Futagoyama.
Estimated time of linkup and power distribution is today at 22:50.
How's progress on our sniping system?
Construction is progressing smoothly.
We'll have her ready by the start of the operation.
What is Eva Unit-01's status?
Currently refitting to G-Type sniping equipment.
Eva will be ready to go in two hours.
Roger. Now for the pilot.
But will he go through with piloting Eva again?
What is the condition of Unit-01's pilot?
The dummy plug system is not yet in its trial stage.
We'll have to make use of the pilot until then.
Resort to brainwashing if necessary?
If things don't work out,
we can still use Rei.
Rei in Unit-01?
Isn't that's much too risky?
We must do whatever it takes to defeat the 8 remaining Angels.
l suppose everything rests on that...
l don't want to pilot Eva.
Everybody assumes I'll pull it off somehow,
so no one praises me.
If l fail, everyone will hate me.
At worst, I'll just die.
What am l doing here?
l thought things would change here.
That something good might happen.
Not to be put through hell.
Are you going to keep living your life running away from pain?
Live? Why should I keep living?
l used to think that I had to keep on living.
No one wants me.
Not father. Not Misato-san.
If I can't pilot Eva, I'm no longer needed.
That's why l have to pilot Eva.
That way I can stay here.
But... when I do...
This ceiling again...
Piloting Eva always brings me here.
Ayanami...
You've been here the whole time?
The time-line for the Operation Yashima beginning at 00:00 tomorrow is as follows.
At 19:30, pilots Ikari and Ayanami report to Terminal 2.
At 20:00, pilots are attached to their respective Evangelions as they are relocated.
At 20:05, they launch.
They arrive at Fortress-2 on Mt. Futagoyama at 20:30
Once there, pilots are to await further orders.
The operation is to begin at midnight.
Your dinner.
I'm... not hungry.
We leave in 90 minutes.
Then we'll have to pilot those things again.
Yes.
I can't. I don't want to be scared anymore.
It's terrifying...  But I can't even run away this time...
You're afraid of Eva?
Then stay here and rest.
Rest?
I will pilot Unit-01.
Ayanami!
Good-bye.
The enemy's drill-tip has penetrated the 17th armored plate!
Target will reach Nerv Headquarters in 4 minutes, 55 seconds.
Linkup of West Hakone line to
Highway-3 of South Tounosawa complete.
Construction of Bank-16 substation is currently on-going.
Installation of 500 kV standard transformers progressing as scheduled.
We are within our time-frame.
Transformer Group-28 is 5 minutes behind schedule.
Those responsible are asked to act quickly and complete installation.
Beginning fourth chance-of-success simulation.
Attempting to reaffirm previous results.
All SMES in place.
Testing Stage One system operation and beyond.
Ultra-high voltage superconductor transformer array checks complete.
This is the giant self-propelled positron rifle?
Its construction is being rushed,
but theoretically it should work.
We're overriding its control systems and
linking it to G-Type Equipment.
Well, we're counting on you for that.
The one thing it seems we can't count on is the pilot.
That part's left to Misato.
Shinji-kun, you were supposed to report long ago.
You made the decision to stay here, didn't you?
Then you've got to do your part in this.
I'm... afraid to pilot Eva.
You and everyone else don't understand.
Always giving orders from safe underground...
Only I have to experience that fear.
You're all selfish!
Come with me for a second.
15 years ago, we lost half of humanity in the Second Impact.
If the Angels are ever to initiate the Third Impact,
humanity would be wiped out.
Everyone.
I've heard all that before, over and over...
If we were to ever allow an Angel to reach Level-EEE of Nerv Headquarters...
An automatic self-destruct would commence.
We will sacrifice ourselves to prevent the Third Impact from occurring.
Everyone here shares that resolve.
This is...
It can't be...
Eva?
No. The bringer of life to this planet,
and the agent of its extinction.
The Second Angel, Lilith.
Lilith?
Yes. The trigger of the Third Impact.
Eva fights to protect Lilith.
That is something only you can do.
We're entrusting the future
of humanity to Eva, and to you.
All that responsibility... Why me?
No particular reason.
Fate simply chose you.
But Shinji-kun, you're not the only one putting your life on the line.
We all are.
One more time. I'll pilot Eva.
l will now inform you both of your roles in this operation.
- Shinji-kun.
- Yes, ma'am.
You will act as gunner in Unit-01.
Yes, ma'am.
Rei will defend you from Unit-00.
Yes, ma'am.
The actual firing will require precise, accurate operation.
Unit-00 needs more calibration and is unsuited for this.
Even though it's not yet fully repaired,
Unit-01 is the better choice.
Alright, Shinji-kun.
Positrons are affected by the Earth's
rotation, magnetic field, and gravity.
The beam will not fire in a straight line.
Don't forget to adjust for these factors.
You must strike the core in a single shot.
But l don't know where its core is.
Don't worry.
Something materializes within the target during its attack phase.
We believe that's where the core is located.
We'll identify the targeting specifics and supply the guidance data.
Follow the on-screen prompts,
and fire when the center indicators meet.
The machinery will take care of the rest.
However, only one point has been established to supply the needed electrical power.
Unit-01 will not be able to move from its firing position.
There's no retreating this time...
Correct.
What if l miss, and the Angel shoots back?
Don't think about that.
Focus on destroying the target in one shot.
If I miss... We're in big trouble, aren't we?
l...
I am to protect Unit-01?
Yes.
Understood.
It's time. You two go change.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
I think...
I think we might die this time.
No.
You won't die.
l will protect you.
I'm not worth protecting.
This message was left at Nerv's Public Affairs Department.
Um, it's me, Suzuhara.
Ikari... No, I should call you Shinji.
Shinji, we're counting on you.
It's me, Aida.
Good luck, Ikari.
Ayanami, why do you pilot Eva?
Because of my bond.
Your bond?
Yes. My bond.
With my father?
With everyone.
You're strong, Ayanami.
I don't have anything else.
It's time. Let's go.
Good-bye.
It is currently 00:00 hours. That is all.
It's time.
Shinji-kun, you've chosen to pilot Eva.
That alone I'm grateful for.
Thank you.

All hands, brace for impact!
How's our energy system?
Still functional. It's already begun recharging.
And the positron rifle?
Undamaged. The barrel is now cooling.
But we don't know if it can manage another shot!
No need to verify. We'll do it anyway.
Shinji-kun, are you alright?!
Quickly, get Unit-01 back into firing position!
Shinji-kun?
Unit-01's pilot is hereby relieved of duty.
Unit-00's pilot will act as gunner.
Ikari?!
If he is unable to act,
then we have no use for him.
Please reconsider!
He chose to pilot Eva without running away.
Until he steps down of his own free will, he should stay!
Shinji, we're counting on you.
Good luck, Ikari.
Please. Believe in your own child.
I believe in Unit-01's pilot!
I'll leave it to you then.
Do as you wish.
Thank you, sir.
Shinji-kun.
Yes, ma'am...
We're entrusting you with all of Japan's energy.
With our hopes and the future of all humanity.

Don't say "I don't have anything else."
Don't say "good-bye" before a mission...
It's too sad.
What? You're crying.
I'm sorry.
l don't know how I should act at times like this.
A smile is enough.
l know. The boy down there has awakened.
He's entered the Generalization Stage, hasn't he?
Yes. The Dead Sea Scrolls Apocrypha has moved on to the Books of Commandments.
