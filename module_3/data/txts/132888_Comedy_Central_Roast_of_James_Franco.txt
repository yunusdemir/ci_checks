 - THIS IS "THE COMEDY CENTRAL
    ROAST OF JAMES FRANCO."
  - THIS WHOLE CROWD IS HIGH,
         JAMES FRANCO.
     AND NOW PLEASE WELCOME
  YOUR ROASTMASTER SETH ROGEN.
     - ( applause, cheers )
       - HELLO! HI, GUYS.
     MY NAME IS SETH ROGEN.
 WELCOME TO "THE COMEDY CENTRAL
    ROAST OF JAMES FRANCO."
           WHY, UH...
        WHY ARE WE HERE?
     WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
         I DON'T KNOW.
      HOW HIGH WAS I WHEN
    I SAID I WOULD DO THIS?
          IT'S CRAZY.
       IS THIS PUNISHMENT
     FOR "THE GUILT TRIP"?
     IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?
         I'M JUST GLAD
     I'M NOT ALONE UP HERE.
       I GOT NICK KROLL,
          JONAH HILL,
        SARAH SILVERMAN,
        ANDY SAMBERG...
             JEFF.
     THIS DAIS IS LITERALLY
   HITLER'S WET DREAM THOUGH,
        IN ALL HONESTY.
      IT'S GOT JEWS, GAYS
     AND WHATEVER AZIZ IS.
      THIS IS SO FUCKED UP
   TO DO WITH YOU GUYS HERE.
        THIS IS SO MEAN.
         I REALLY LIKE
      THESE PEOPLE. UH...
          ANYWAY, I'LL
     START WITH THE JEWIEST
     AND WORK MY WAY DOWN:
    SARAH SILVERMAN IS HERE.
  SARAH AND I ACTUALLY WORKED
      TOGETHER ON THE FILM
       "TAKE THIS WALTZ,"
    WHICH SHE WAS GREAT IN.
 SHE ACTUALLY DID FULL-FRONTAL
      NUDITY IN THE MOVIE,
      WHICH WAS FANTASTIC.
        IT WAS AMAZING.
        I ALWAYS THOUGHT
     SHE WAS VERY LIBERAL,
BUT IT TURNS OUT SHE'S ACTUALLY
    A GIANT BUSH SUPPORTER.
             HUGE!
      AZIZ ANSARI IS HERE.
              YES.
  THIS IS ACTUALLY THE LONGEST
  AZIZ HAS EVER HEARD ME TALK
    WITHOUT CHECKING TO SEE
     IF SOMEONE MORE FAMOUS
        HAS TEXTED HIM.
    I WANNA MAKE FUN OF YOU
       FOR BEING FRIENDS
        WITH KANYE WEST.
 BUT TRUTHFULLY, IT'S THE ONLY
 COOL THING THERE IS ABOUT YOU,
      SO I CAN'T DO THAT.
      JONAH HILL IS HERE.
    A LOT OF PEOPLE COMPARE,
 UH, JONAH TO A YOUNG BELUSHI...
          JIM BELUSHI.
    JONAH'S ACTUALLY STARTED
   TO MOVE AWAY FROM COMEDY.
    IT HAPPENS FIVE MINUTES
  INTO HIS MOVIE "THE SITTER."
     ANDY SAMBERG IS HERE.
        ANDY PLAYS A COP
      ON HIS NEW FOX SHOW.
     HIS FIRST CASE WILL BE
INVESTIGATING THE DISAPPEARANCE
      OF HIS NEW FOX SHOW.
      A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
LIVE-TWEETING THE SHOW TONIGHT.
   SPEAKING OF 140 CHARACTERS
   NO ONE GIVES A SHIT ABOUT,
      BILL HADER IS HERE.
 BILL'S A GREAT IMPRESSIONIST.
      RIGHT NOW HE'S DOING
         AN IMPRESSION
  OF A GUY WHO REALLY REGRETS
         LEAVING S.N.L.
      NICK KROLL IS HERE.
              YES!
           NICK KROLL
    IS THE SCARY JEWISH FACE
      MEL GIBSON RUNS FROM
   IN HIS DREAMS EVERY NIGHT.
            "AHHHH!"
             YEAH.
     "GIMME YOUR PENNIES."
   LET'S START TALKING ABOUT
  SOMEONE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GIVE
  A SHIT ABOUT: JAMES FRANCO.
        YOU KNOW, WHO IS
     THE REAL JAMES FRANCO?
        IS HE AN ARTIST?
        IS HE AN ACTOR?
        IS HE A SCHOLAR?
    HE'S TOUGH TO PIN DOWN,
 ALTHOUGH I'VE HEARD MANY GUYS
    HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO IT.
       LET'S TAKE A LOOK
 AT THE CAREER OF JAMES FRANCO.
    - I GOT A LOT OF PLANS.
- OKAY, WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING?
           - PLENTY.
- HE IS A DIRECTOR, AN AUTHOR...
      - PAINTER, PILOT...
     - A SOAKING-WET GUCCI
          SPOKESMAN...
         - A STUDENT...
        - AND AN ARTIST.
   - GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.
  - THIS IS MY FUCKING DREAM,
   Y'ALL. MAKE IT COME TRUE.
        - RUB YOUR WRIST
    AGAINST MY BELT BUCKLE.
     YEAH, LET ME SAVE YOU!
      - WHAT DO YOU THINK,
I WANT TO BE TERRIBLE AT SCHOOL?
     - I ACTUALLY DID FALL
        ASLEEP IN CLASS.
         - WHO DOESN'T
 FUCKING FALL ASLEEP IN CLASS?
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
   ARE YOU READING MY BOOKS?
             - OH.
    - STOP IT! STOP LEARNING
        FOR ONE SECOND!
            - OKAY.
        - JAMES FRANCO.
    - THIS GUY AIN'T SO BAD.
   - GOD, I'VE MISSED YOU SO!
   - JAMES FRANCO DIDN'T SUCK
      ANY DICK LAST NIGHT.
 NOW I KNOW Y'ALL ARE TRIPPING.
           - * I...
          - ALL RIGHT!
       - * WANNA BE...
         - LOOK AT ME.
       - * JUST LIKE...
          - COOL, MAN!
     - * JAMES FRANCO...
           - EFF YOU.
       - EFF ME? EFF YOU.
           - EFF YOU!
        - EFF YOU, MAN.
    - EFF YOU, MOTHER-EFFER.
     - * BRASS MONKEY...
       - GIMME SOME LOVE.
     - * THAT FUNKY MONKEY,
         BRASS MONKEY *
       - I'M JUST MARKING
         MY TERRITORY.
   - * THAT FUNKY MONKEY...
  - THE ARTIST KNOWN AS FRANCO
  WON'T MIND THAT YOU TRASHED
        HIS MASTERPIECE.
    - YOUR MAMA'S PUSSY WAS
  THE CANVAS, YOUR DAD'S DICK
      WAS THE PAINTBRUSH.
     BOOM, YOU'RE THE ART!
    - THANKS, JAMES FRANCO.
   - WHY DON'T WE DO A SEQUEL
    TO "PINEAPPLE EXPRESS"?
        - YOU GUYS WANT
      TO BUY SOME CHRONIC?
           SMELL IT!
       LIKE GOD'S VAGINA.
 - * I'M GONNA POP SOME TAGS *
         * ONLY GOT $20
         IN MY POCKET *
 * THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME...
      - WE DO IT GANGSTA!
            GANGSTA!
      I'M FROM A DIFFERENT
         PLANET, Y'ALL!
  AND I JUST TRANSPORTED Y'ALL
  OUT TO FUCKING SPACE, Y'ALL!
            * DAMN,
   THAT'S A COLD-ASS HONKY. *
   - WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
      HOSTING THE OSCARS?
         - I DID THAT.
  - SO WOULD YOU EVER CONSIDER
     HOSTING IT, PROPERLY?
        - I'M THE ACTOR
     JAMES FRANCO, DAMN IT!
      AND I'M IN LOVE WITH
    A JAPANESE BODY PILLOW!
     - * I'VE BEEN LOOKING
    IN A NEW DIRECTION... *
          - AVENGE ME!
             - NO!
       - * I WANNA LAUGH
       AND I WANNA CRY *
         * I WANNA SPIT
    BUT MY MOUTH'S TOO DRY *
  * I WANNA RUN BUT I'M SCARED
  'CAUSE MY LEGS DON'T GO... *
          - OW, HELP!
          HELP! HELP!
             HELP!
  - THE FIRST GUY THAT I EVER
     SOLD TO THAT I BECAME
         FRIENDS WITH.
     - B.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.F.
     - BEST FUCKING FRIENDS
         FOREVER, MAN.
   - * IN A NEW DIRECTION.
       - BOOM. IT'S OVER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   EVERY MAN WANTS TO BE HIM
AND HE WANTS TO BE IN EVERY MAN.
   THE PRETTIEST BOY I KNOW...
         JAMES FRANCO!
 WHERE... WHERE IS JAMES FRANCO?
           - COME ON.
  - READY THREE... TAKE THREE.
       OKAY, I GOTTA GO.
         YOU TAKE OVER.
    - FRANCO? WHAT THE FUCK
    IS HE DOING BACK THERE?
   - ALL RIGHT, SPIDEY-POSE!
            GENIUS!
   - MR. FRANCO, I'M SO SORRY
        MY PAPER'S LATE.
        - OH, LATE? "F"!
           - LOVE IT.
      BEAUTIFUL. YES, YES!
    AND... THAT'S OUR COVER.
   - CONGRATULATIONS, DOCTOR.
    - ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,
           THANK YOU.
             OKAY.
 - "JAMES FRANCO DOCUMENTARY,"
    SCENE 1-APPLE, TAKE ONE.
      - HIT IT, ALL RIGHT.
          HERE WE GO.
          - HI, JAMES.
          - ALL RIGHT!
WELCOME JAMES FRANCO, EVERYBODY!
   I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED HE
SHOWED UP, TO BE TOTALLY HONEST.
    WHY ARE WE HERE, JAMES?
         - I DON'T F...
     - CAN YOU TELL US WHY
      THE FUCK WE'RE HERE?
    - NO FUCKING IDEA, BUD.
     - I KNOW WHY I'M HERE.
     'CAUSE WHENEVER YOU DO
SOMETHING WITHOUT ME, IT SUCKS.
      THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
       WE'RE HERE TONIGHT
     SO JAMES CAN LIVE OUT
     ONE OF HIS UNFULFILLED
       SEXUAL FANTASIES:
         TO HAVE A ROOM
      FULL OF HIS FRIENDS
       SHIT ALL OVER HIM.
     FRANCO, YOU LOOK LIKE
  YOU'RE ASLEEP. DID YOU JUST
   READ A JAMES FRANCO BOOK?
    HE'S HAD A GREAT CAREER.
          JUDD APATOW
 GAVE BOTH ME AND HIM OUR START
ON THE SHOW "FREAKS AND GEEKS."
          UH... YEAH.
           IT'S TRUE.
    JUDD WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
       DIRECT THIS ROAST,
 BUT COMEDY CENTRAL DIDN'T WANT
 IT TO BE 40 MINUTES TOO LONG.
      JAMES BECAME FAMOUS
    FOR PLAYING JAMES DEAN,
    WHICH MAKES SENSE 'CAUSE
  THEY BOTH SUCKED SOME DICKS
  AND MADE THREE GOOD MOVIES.
 YOU ASKED US TO DO THIS, MAN.
       I DON'T KNOW WHY.
    TO PREPARE FOR HIS ROLE
        IN "127 HOURS,"
 HE TOLD ME HE SPENT FIVE DAYS
 WITH HIS ARM INSIDE THE ROCK...
        ACTUALLY HE GOES
     BY DWAYNE JOHNSON NOW.
    I KEEP FORGETTING THAT.
   HE'S THE LAST GUY I SHOULD
     BE MAKING JOKES ABOUT.
HE'LL LITERALLY FUCKING KILL ME.
        LOOK AT ME DOING
   ALL THE TALKIN' WHILE YOU
    SIT THERE DOING NOTHING.
   I FEEL LIKE I'M CO-HOSTING
      THE OSCARS WITH YOU.
       SAY WHAT YOU WILL
      ABOUT JAMES'S AWFUL
  AND BORDERLINE CONTEMPTUOUS
  PERFORMANCE AT THE OSCARS...
    IN THIS WORLD THERE CAN
   ONLY BE ONE JAMES FRANCO,
      'CAUSE IF THERE WERE
       TWO JAMES FRANCOS,
       THEY'D NEVER STOP
    BUTTFUCKING EACH OTHER.
     HOW 'BOUT WE BRING OUT
    OUR FIRST ROASTER, HUH?
          THERE WE GO.
     YOU PROBABLY KNOW HIM
      FROM HIS SMALL ROLES
  IN MOVIES LIKE "DATE NIGHT"
  AND "GET HIM TO THE GREEK,"
     AND HIS STARRING ROLES
       IN NO MOVIES EVER.
   PLEASE WELCOME NICK KROLL.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
   GIVE IT UP FOR SETH ROGEN.
        LET HIM HEAR IT.
        GOD, SETH ROGEN
        IS SO JEWISH...
      - HOW JEWISH IS HE?
        - SETH ROGEN IS
      SO FUCKING JEWISH...
      ANYWAY, I'M EXCITED
      TO BE HERE TONIGHT.
       SETH, YOU'RE DOING
  A REALLY GOOD JOB UP THERE.
     IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB.
     NOW MANY OF YOU MIGHT
         NOT KNOW THIS,
  BUT SETH ROGEN HAS A WRITING
  AND DIRECTING PARTNER NAMED
         EVAN GOLDBERG.
    WHAT DOES THIS OTHER GUY
 LOOK LIKE THAT YOU'RE THE FACE
       OF THE OPERATION?
       I ASSUME HE'S LIKE
     A SWEATY ORTHODOX JEW
  EATING A PASTRAMI SANDWICH:
          "HEY, SETHY,
       YEAH, I ADDED NINE
    DICK JOKES ON PAGE FOUR.
    AND I WAS THINKING THAT
 THE GUYS ARE FRIENDS AND THEN
      THEY'RE NOT FRIENDS
AND THEN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE
     THEY'RE FRIENDS AGAIN.
   AND ALSO THEY SHOULD SMOKE
    A LOT OF GANJA, SETHY."
      WE GOT A LOT OF JEWS
     ON STAGE HERE TONIGHT.
      YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY
  THAT JEWS CONTROL THE MEDIA.
  AND WE DO. AND YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE WE'RE REALLY GOOD AT IT.
  I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE SAY,
 "WHY ARE ALL THOSE BLACK DUDES
        IN THE N.B.A.?"
     BECAUSE THEY'RE BETTER
   AT DUNKING, JUST LIKE JEWS
  ARE BETTER AT WHATEVER JOKE
  MY JEW WRITERS COME UP WITH.
    LISA LAMPANELLI'S HERE!
     - ( scattered cheers )
        - OH, I'M SORRY,
       THAT'S JEFF ROSS.
     ANDY SAMBERG IS HERE!
          OR AS I LIKE
  TO CALL HIM: BETTER-LOOKING
      MORE-SUCCESSFUL ME.
          JONAH HILL.
   YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
        ARE GONNA TOUCH
 ON YOUR WEIGHT TONIGHT, JONAH,
   BUT NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE
        GONNA TALK ABOUT
        WHAT AN ASSHOLE
         YOU'VE BECOME.
     BUT WE'RE HERE TONIGHT
   TO CELEBRATE JAMES FRANCO,
        THE MAN WHO MADE
  THIS WHOLE EVENING POSSIBLE.
        JAMES ALWAYS HAS
         THAT LOOK OF,
 "OH MAN, HOW DID THIS PERFECT
     AMOUNT OF FACIAL HAIR
       END UP ON MY FACE?
 YOU KNOW, I'M FROM PALO ALTO,
        FROM CALIFORNIA,
YET NO ONE QUESTIONS WHY I TALK
 LIKE I'M FROM 1940s BROOKLYN."
     JAMES FRANCO IS TRULY
  OUR GENERATION'S JAMES DEAN.
      JAMES DEAN OF COURSE
 DIED AT THE TENDER AGE OF 24,
        SPARING HIMSELF
       THE EMBARRASSMENT
 OF GETTING ROASTED BY A BUNCH
    OF JEALOUS JEW MONSTERS.
 JAMES, HONESTLY, WHAT HAPPENED
  WITH YOU AND ANNE HATHAWAY?
     DID YOU BONE HER OUT?
         YOU KNOW WHAT?
      YOU'RE A GENTLEMAN,
 YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THAT.
    JUST SQUINT ONCE IF YES.
      QUICK REMINDER THAT
    IF AT ANY POINT TONIGHT
  JAMES FULLY OPENS HIS EYES,
     THERE WILL BE SIX MORE
        WEEKS OF SUMMER.
 BUT IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, JAMES,
   I ADMIRE YOUR WORK ETHIC.
       I THINK YOU'RE...
          ( mumbles )
      I'M JUST HERE TO GET
     SLIGHTLY MORE FAMOUS.
         AND REMEMBER,
 IF ANYONE HERE BOMBS TONIGHT,
        IT'S JUST 'CAUSE
  THEY'RE DOING AN IMPRESSION
 OF JAMES FRANCO AT THE OSCARS.
        THANK YOU, GUYS.
 ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR NIGHT.
           THAT'S IT.
  - ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO ADMIT
      I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS
      OF OUR NEXT ROASTER.
 HE'S GOTTEN TO WORK WITH GUYS
    LIKE QUENTIN TARANTINO,
  MARTIN SCORSESE, BRAD PITT.
   AND I'M STUCK DOING MOVIES
  WITH SELF-IMPORTANT ASSHOLES
        LIKE JONAH HILL.
   PLEASE WELCOME JONAH HILL.
         - ( applause )
          - HI, GUYS,
             JAMES.
        HOW'S IT GOING?
  IT'S REALLY GREAT TO BE HERE
      FOR MY BUDDY JAMES.
     I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY
 THEY WOULD CHOOSE ME, THOUGH,
        BECAUSE THERE'S
     NOTHING REALLY ANYONE
    CAN MAKE FUN OF ME FOR.
            I GUESS,
      THESE GUYS ARE GONNA
 MAKE FUN OF ME FOR SOMETHING.
        SO I JUST THINK
     I'M JUST GONNA BE NICE
          AND SAY WHAT
       I LIKE ABOUT THEM
     BECAUSE I REALLY LOVE
   ALL THESE PEOPLE UP HERE.
 UM, YOU KNOW, LIKE BILL HADER,
      GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.
         - ( applause )
            - RIGHT?
   HE WAS BRILLIANT ON S.N.L.
       HE WAS BRILLIANT.
   AND WHEN HE LEFT THE SHOW
           THIS YEAR,
  EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS LIKE
      "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
       YOU'RE NEVER EVER
  GONNA WORK AGAIN LIKE EVER!"
 AND WHAT DOES MY MAN BILL DO?
             BOOM!
HE GOES AHEAD AND BOOKS HIMSELF
     A T-MOBILE COMMERCIAL.
    - ( laughter, applause )
     - WHO'S LAUGHING NOW,
        LORNE MICHAELS?
        MY MAN BILL IS.
       I MEAN, THIS GUY'S
         CASHING CHECKS
    FROM THE FOURTH LARGEST
 MOBILE PROVIDER IN THE NATION.
          - ( laughs )
          - AND LOOK...
           NO, LOOK,
 I RESPECT BILL BECAUSE SPRINT
   WAS COMING AFTER HIM HARD.
 BUT HE JUST HELD OUT FOR THAT
    FUCK YOU T-MOBILE MONEY.
        BILL'S AWESOME.
          ( chuckles )
       I LOVE YOU, BILL.
        ANDY SAMBERG IS
    ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE.
          I LOVE HIM.
     AND NOW THAT HE'S GOT
        HIS NEW TV SHOW,
     "BROOKLYN NINE-NINE,"
  WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS ABOUT
       THIS BROOKLYN COP
      WHO TRIED TO MAKE IT
     IN THE MOVIE BUSINESS,
       BUT FAILED AND GOT
        SENT BACK TO TV.
            - YEAH.
     - MY ONLY QUESTION IS,
    ANDY, WHEN THE SHOW GETS
 CANCELED AFTER FIVE EPISODES,
  ARE YOU GONNA DO A DIFFERENT
      CELLPHONE COMMERCIAL
 OR ARE THEY GONNA TURN BILL'S
       INTO A TWO-HANDER
     FOR BOTH OF YOU GUYS?
        ANDY'S AWESOME.
  SARAH SILVERMAN, SO AMAZING,
         SO BEAUTIFUL.
    I THINK YOU'RE GORGEOUS.
     AND I THINK IT'S CRAZY
    BECAUSE EVERYONE'S LIKE
    "SHE'S HOT FOR A COMIC."
   BUT I DON'T AGREE BECAUSE
SHE'S NOT JUST HOT FOR A COMIC.
 SHE'S HOT FOR SOMEONE HER AGE.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
  - SERIOUSLY, SARAH, YOU WERE
  MY FAVORITE COMIC AS A KID.
          - ( mouths )
         - ( laughter )
    - SARAH IS A ROLE MODEL
FOR EVERY LITTLE GIRL OUT THERE.
I MEAN EVERY LITTLE GIRL DREAMS
    OF BEING A 58-YEAR OLD,
   SINGLE, STAND-UP COMEDIAN
   WITH NO ROMANTIC PROSPECTS
        ON THE HORIZON.
     THEY ALL DREAM OF IT,
       BUT SARAH DID IT.
        - I'M LIVING IT.
        - AND PEOPLE SAY
    IT'S TOO LATE FOR SARAH
     TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL
     IN MOVIES AT HER AGE.
    I, AGAIN, DO NOT AGREE.
      IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.
 I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE
  ASKING YOU TO BEAR CHILDREN
    OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT...
         - ( laughter )
  - 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
          ( laughter )
            - NOPE.
  - AND THEN THERE'S JEFF ROSS
      WHO'S GONNA FUCKING
         KILL ME LATER.
     SO I FIGURED I SHOULD
        GO PRETTY HARD.
     - BRING IT. BRING IT.
            BRING IT.
       - I NEVER GAVE YOU
    THIS COMPLIMENT BEFORE,
 BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY THE REASON
I DECIDED TO BECOME SUCCESSFUL.
     I SAW WHAT YOU BECAME
         AND IT SCARED
   THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF ME.
  JEFF, YOU'RE LIKE THE GHOST
    OF ME AND SETH'S FUTURE
      IF WE NEVER MADE IT.
   YOU KNOW, JEFF, I ACTUALLY
   HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.
     WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE,
    DO YOU JUST STRAIGHT UP
          LIE TO THEM
        AND SAY, "YEAH,
     I'M IN SHOW BUSINESS"
       OR ARE YOU HONEST?
        'CAUSE I IMAGINE
       IT WOULD BE EASIER
        JUST TO SAY LIKE
    "YEAH, I'M UNEMPLOYED,"
       INSTEAD OF HAVING
    TO STRUGGLE AND EXPLAIN
          LIKE, "YEAH,
     I'M ON TV ONCE A YEAR.
      IT'S LIKE THIS THING
  WHERE FAMOUS PEOPLE COME IN
  AND I'M PART OF IT, KIND OF.
    LIKE I MAKE FUN OF THEM,
      BUT THEN THEY LEAVE
   AND GO ON TO THEIR CAREERS
    AND I JUST KIND OF STAY
   AND CLEAN EVERYTHING UP."
  BUT SERIOUSLY, GUYS, CAN YOU
PLEASE PICK UP AFTER YOURSELVES?
  IT'S GONNA MAKE JEFF'S LIFE
         A LOT EASIER.
           THANK YOU.
   JEFF'S AWESOME, YOU GUYS.
          ( chuckles )
   AZIZ, NATASHA, NICK KROLL,
     I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS
      ARE JAMES'S FRIENDS
       FROM HIGH SCHOOL.
  BUT I THINK THAT IS SO DOPE
   THAT YOU GUYS ARE WILLING
         TO GET UP HERE
    EVEN THOUGH NO ONE KNOWS
   WHO THE FUCK YOU GUYS ARE.
     OKAY, THAT WAS A JOKE.
    I KNOW WHO YOU GUYS ARE.
        BUT, GENUINELY,
      AZIZ HATES THIS JOKE
     BECAUSE ALL AZIZ WANTS
        IS TO BE FAMOUS.
      I MEAN, HE'S FAMOUS
      IN LIKE SILVER LAKE.
  BUT WHO GIVES A SHIT, RIGHT?
         - ( laughter )
  - NICK AND NATASHA, HOW MUCH
    DOES IT BUM YOU GUYS OUT
   THAT EVEN BEING ASSOCIATED
          WITH YOU TWO
      IS LITERALLY KILLING
        AZIZ RIGHT NOW.
       THAT'S FUCKED UP.
       CAN WE TALK ABOUT
      MY BUDDY SETH ROGEN?
            COME ON.
         - ( applause )
      - I ADORE THIS GUY.
   I FUCKING ADORE THIS GUY.
      HE'S A GREAT WRITER,
        A GREAT FRIEND.
  AND WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT SETH
     WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT
      "THE GREEN HORNET."
     WE JUST CAN'T, RIGHT?
      BECAUSE EVERY PERSON
      IN THE WORLD IS LIKE
      "'THE GREEN HORNET'
      LOST SO MUCH MONEY."
      BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE.
IT DIDN'T LOSE THAT MUCH MONEY.
   I MEAN EVERY SINGLE PERSON
          IN THE WORLD
       FUCKING HATED IT,
       BUT IT DIDN'T LOSE
        THAT MUCH MONEY.
      AND THAT'S THE GOAL
       AFTER ALL, RIGHT?
  TO MAKE TERRIBLE MOVIES THAT
  DON'T LOSE THAT MUCH MONEY.
    - ( applause, laughter )
   - SETH'S FUCKING AWESOME.
             UM...
  NOW, JAMES, THE MAIN COURSE.
    THE FEAST DE RESISTANCE.
     JAMES LOVES EDUCATION.
  HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO SCHOOL.
       DID YOU KNOW THAT
     HE EVEN WENT TO YALE?
          OKAY, LOOK,
  I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
       AND IT'S NOT TRUE.
     HE GOT INTO YALE JUST
     LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
  HE GOT REALLY, REALLY FAMOUS
     AND JUST KIND OF ASKED
       A PERSON FROM YALE
     IF HE COULD GO THERE,
   JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
     AND EVERYONE IS GONNA
       MAKE FUN OF JAMES
        FOR THE OSCARS.
         IT'S OBVIOUS.
      EVERYONE WAS SAYING,
   "JAMES WAS DEAD UP THERE."
      BUT I THINK THAT WAS
     ANNE HATHAWAY'S FAULT.
  I MEAN, FUCK HER FOR TRYING,
          LIKE AT ALL.
          HOW DARE SHE
      ATTEMPT IN SOME WAY
          TO ENTERTAIN
     THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
     TRYING TO ESCAPE THEIR
     LIVES FOR A FEW HOURS.
     I COMMEND YOU, JAMES.
   YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS HEAR
    GEORGE CLOONEY AND OTHER
     BIG MOVIE STARS SAYING
         "MY PHILOSOPHY
      ON MAKING MOVIES IS
          ONE FOR THEM
        AND ONE FOR ME."
     BUT NOT MY GUY JAMES.
       NOT MY BOY JAMES!
       JAMES IS A REBEL.
         HE HAS HIS OWN
      PHILOSOPHY ON THIS.
         "ONE FOR THEM,
       FIVE FOR NOBODY."
      ( chuckling ) OKAY.
        ALL JOKES ASIDE,
         JAMES, YOU ARE
  THE WEIRDEST FUCKING PERSON
      ANYONE HAS EVER MET
     IN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE.
  I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR 10 YEARS
   AND I'M STILL PRETTY SURE
   I'VE NEVER MET YOU BEFORE.
BUT FOR SOME REASON, I FUCKING,
    I LOVE YOU, DUDE, SO...
   - OUR NEXT ROASTER WAS #29
      ON "MAXIM"'S HOT 100
       IN THE YEAR 2007.
PLEASE WELCOME SARAH SILVERMAN.
           THANK YOU.
      SO HOW ABOUT A HAND
   FOR OUR HOST FOR TONIGHT,
          SETH ROGEN?
        ISN'T HE ROUND?
          I CAN'T TELL
      IF THIS IS THE DAIS
      OR THE LINE TO SUCK
      JUDD APATOW'S BALLS.
         IT'S SO JEWY.
         WHAT IS THIS,
   "THE COMEDY CENTRAL AUDIT
       OF JAMES FRANCO"?
        I SAW THE MOVIE
       "THE GUILT TRIP."
 SETH, WHAT WAS IT LIKE WORKING
     WITH BARBRA STREISAND?
      AND HOW DID YOU TWO
     TELL EACH OTHER APART?
      LIKE, DID ONE OF YOU
     WEAR A CARNATION OR...
  WAS IT SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
        SETH'S PARENTS...
       UH, SETH'S PARENTS
   ACTUALLY MET AT A KIBBUTZ.
       IF YOU DON'T KNOW
       WHAT A KIBBUTZ IS,
   IT'S A COMMUNITY IN ISRAEL
        WHERE APPARENTLY
  THEY DON'T ALLOW ABORTIONS.
 RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW STARTED
 SETH ROLLED A GIGANTIC FATTY,
        BECAUSE THAT WAS
          THE ONLY WAY
    WE COULD GET JONAH HILL
        ONTO THE STAGE.
         JAMES, I LOVED
       "SPRING BREAKERS."
        "SPRING BREAKER"
    IS ACTUALLY THE NICKNAME
       WE GAVE JEFF ROSS
     WHEN HE SITS ON A BED.
       JAMES RECENTLY WON
         THE ALLY AWARD
        FOR HIS SUPPORT
   OF THE L.G.B.T. COMMUNITY.
    IT'S A PRESTIGIOUS AWARD
     THAT IS GIVEN ANALLY...
           ANNUALLY!
      IT'S GIVEN ANNUALLY.
      JONAH HILL IS HERE.
         I LOVE JONAH.
   JONAH IS SUCH A JEWY DICK,
  YOU HAVE TO WATCH HIS MOVIES
   THROUGH A HOLE IN A SHEET.
     JONAH ACTUALLY GAINED
      50 LBS FOR HIS ROLE
IN THE NEW MARTIN SCORSESE FILM,
     BECAUSE THE PRODUCERS
     WANTED THE CHARACTER
   TO BE A "JONAH HILL TYPE."
      BUT HE SLIMMED DOWN
        A LOT LAST YEAR.
 BUT WHAT JONAH LOST IN WEIGHT,
      HE GAINED IN WEIGHT.
       JONAH, ON A SCALE
        FROM ONE TO 10,
      DO YOU OWN A SCALE?
         BUT SERIOUSLY,
          YOU HAVE HAD
   SUCH A BODY TRANSFORMATION
  IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
    YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY
        FROM JUST BEING
   SONNY AND CHER'S DAUGHTER.
           IT'S DONE?
        HI, BILL HADER.
   I HATE MAKING FUN OF BILL.
    HE'S SO SWEET AND GENTLE
AND I USED TO DATE HIS BROTHER,
       JEW HATER. BUT...
  NATASHA LEGGERO, EVERYBODY.
    I LOVE NATASHA SO MUCH.
       THIS IS NATASHA'S
     FIRST ROAST, YOU GUYS.
           SHE'S LIKE
      A LITTLE CHIHUAHUA,
    'CAUSE SHE'S TEENY TINY
       AND SHE'S FEISTY,
        AND SHE'S FILLED
      WITH MEXICAN D.N.A.
  JUST TO BE CLEAR, WHEN I SAY
 "FILLED WITH MEXICAN D.N.A.,"
      I MEAN, SHE'S FILLED
WITH THE CUM OF MEXICAN PEOPLE.
        LIKE, FROM TONS
      OF MEXICAN GENTLEMEN
         CUMMING INSIDE
        HER VAST VAGINA.
            AND ALSO
     FROM HER GUZZLING CUM.
    I JUST DIDN'T WANT THERE
   TO BE A MISUNDERSTANDING.
  SPEAKING OF BROWNISH PEOPLE,
      AZIZ ANSARI IS HERE.
  I HAVE BEEN A HUGE SUPPORTER
       OF AZIZ FOR YEARS,
     AND FOR ONLY THE PRICE
      OF A CUP OF COFFEE.
          BY THE WAY,
   AZIZ CAN'T STAY ALL NIGHT.
      HE'S GOTTA GET BACK
        IN THE CUPBOARD.
            WHEN...
         BUT TONIGHT IS
   ABOUT OUR MAN OF THE HOUR,
    MR. JAMES EDWARD FRANCO,
      SITTING TO MY RIGHT.
        JAMES IS OPENLY
     A VERY SEXUAL PERSON.
     I DON'T THINK JAMES IS
  NECESSARILY GAY OR STRAIGHT,
       I THINK HE JUST...
       HE LITERALLY CAN'T
      OPEN HIS EYES ENOUGH
    TO SEE WHO HE'S FUCKING.
    JAMES DID A MOVIE CALLED
    "INTERIOR. LEATHER BAR."
  IT'S ABOUT GAY PORNOGRAPHY.
        HE WAS INSPIRED
          AFTER HE ATE
      A GIANT BAG OF DICKS
      HOSTING THE OSCARS.
        ROBERT DE NIRO,
   SEAN PENN, JULIA ROBERTS...
      THESE ARE JUST SOME
       OF THE HUGE STARS
     JAMES HAS WORKED WITH
           WHO DIDN'T
     WANNA BE HERE TONIGHT.
       BUT YOU LANDED ME
   AND I'M SO LUCKY FOR THAT.
     CONGRATULATIONS, DOLL.
     - WE ARE VERY EXCITED
  AND I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT...
      HONORED TO INTRODUCE
       OUR NEXT ROASTER.
        HE'S RESPONSIBLE
    NOT JUST FOR MY CAREER,
         BUT FOR EVERY
     SINGLE PERSON'S CAREER
      IN THIS ENTIRE ROOM.
     LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
         PLEASE WELCOME
  THE PRESIDENT OF HOLLYWOOD.
      - HELLO, EVERYBODY.
    HELLO, HELLO, EVERYBODY.
   BEFORE I START I JUST WANT
 TO SAY TO EVERYONE UP HERE...
        YOU'RE WELCOME.
       IN NO OTHER PLACE
         BUT HOLLYWOOD
   COULD THESE 10 PEOPLE MAKE
  THE KIND OF MONEY THEY MAKE
    AND SLEEP WITH THE KIND
   OF PEOPLE THEY SLEEP WITH.
     AND SO AGAIN I SAY...
        YOU'RE WELCOME.
          SETH ROGEN.
        YOU'RE WELCOME,
       YOU HAIRY CANUCK.
        YOU ARE WELCOME.
         I, HOLLYWOOD,
   MADE THE WORLD ACCEPT YOU.
  I PUT YOU ON A MOVIE POSTER
  AND I SAID, "DEAL WITH IT."
         AND THEN I PUT
BARBRA STREISAND ON THAT POSTER
   AND THE WORLD SAID, "NO!"
       "THE GUILT TRIP"!
            LISTEN,
      IF I WANTED TO WATCH
         TWO UGLY JEWS
    WEAVING THROUGH TRAFFIC,
      I'D WATCH SEINFELD'S
          WEB SERIES.
    AND, JONAH, I'M ASSUMING
  YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE SETH IS?
         PEOPLE CALL ME
   ALL THE TIME AND THEY SAY,
 "HOLLYWOOD, DO WE REALLY NEED
      TWO OF THESE GUYS?"
     BUT I OWN YOU, JONAH.
       I FUCKIN' OWN YOU.
     IF I TRIED TO BUY YOU
    ON iTUNES, IT WOULD SAY,
         "ARE YOU SURE
     YOU WANT TO PURCHASE?
      BECAUSE YOU ALREADY
        OWN THIS FUCK."
         ANDY SAMBERG.
  THE CORRECT PRONUNCIATION...
      ( heavily accented )
        LOOKING FORWARD
       TO YOUR NEW SHOW,
     "BROOKLYN NINE-NINE."
          FUNNY COPS.
     YOU'RE ALWAYS PUSHING
      THE ENVELOPE, ANDY.
      WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
        WHEN YOU RUN OUT
 OF FUNNY CRIMES LIKE GRAFFITI
        AND PICKPOCKETS?
  CAN'T WAIT TO SEE EPISODE 10
   WHEN "BROOKLYN NINE-NINE"
    HAS TO DEAL WITH A RAPE.
         ( mockingly )
 "OH, I DROPPED THE RAPE KIT?!
         SHMORGY-DORG!"
   YEAH, THAT'S GONNA BE FUN.
     AZIZ, YOU'RE WELCOME.
         AZIZ, I ADMIRE
     HOW YOU'VE NEVER TAKEN
THE STEREOTYPICAL INDIAN ROLES.
  AND I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
        THAT IF YOU DID,
         YOU WOULD MAKE
      SO MUCH MORE MONEY.
      IF YOU CAME OUT HERE
  RIGHT NOW WITH CROSSED EYES
 PLAYING A SITAR, I WOULD FALL
      ON MY ASS LAUGHING.
   BUT STILL, WHAT AN ACTOR.
     SUCH PHENOMENAL RANGE.
YOU'RE LIKE THE DANIEL DAY-LEWIS
    OF ONLY DOING ONE THING.
           JEFF ROSS!
       HI, I'M HOLLYWOOD.
     WE HAVEN'T MET BEFORE.
      - NICE TO MEET YOU.
       NICE TO MEET YOU.
  - UH UH UH, SORRY I HAVEN'T
 BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING YET.
   LIKE ENTERPRISE RENTAL CAR
       ON CHRISTMAS DAY,
         I DO NOT HAVE
       A VEHICLE FOR YOU.
   JEFFREY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND
        WHAT I'M SAYING?
      - YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
     - JEFF DOESN'T GET IT.
 NO, I GOTTA SPEAK TO JEFF NOW
    IN HIS NATIVE LANGUAGE.
     EXCUSE ME, EVERYBODY.
  ( mimicking Jabba the Hutt )
          OH-OH-OH-OH!
      ( speaking Huttese )
           ...WOOKIE.
    HEY, WHERE'S BILL HADER?
    HUH?  WHERE'S THAT GUY?
      I LOVED HIS ORIGINAL
      CHARACTERS ON S.N.L.
       STEFON, A GAY GUY!
      OOOH, HOW ORIGINAL!
          WHAT'S NEXT,
  AN OLD JEW IN A TRACK SUIT?
 BUT BILL'S OKAY IN THE MOVIES
          IF YOU NEED
  A BEST FRIEND'S BEST FRIEND
 TO ASK AN EXPOSITION QUESTION.
       "SO, YOU'RE GONNA
     FOLLOW HER TO HAWAII?"
    "YES, BILL. NOW FUCK OFF
  FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE."
     AND NOW I COME TO YOU,
         JAMES FRANCO.
        YOU'RE WELCOME.
      AND NO ONE CAN ARGUE
WITH YOUR INTEGRITY AS AN ACTOR.
        FROM JERKING OFF
       NEXT TO A BOULDER
        TO SUCKING A GUN
          LIKE A DICK,
         YOU ARE TRULY
  THE JIMMY STEWART OF TODAY.
  BUT I KNOW IT HASN'T ALWAYS
   BEEN EASY FOR YOU, JAMES.
    YOU OVERCAME A CRIPPLING
      CHILDHOOD AFFLICTION
      KNOWN AS DUMB FACE.
     BUT YOU NEVER LET THAT
   INTERFERE WITH YOUR DREAM
  OF MAKING DOG-SHIT MOVIES...
 AND EXPLICITLY GAY GUCCI ADS.
        AND THE OSCARS.
          THE OSCARS.
    LOOK, I DON'T EVEN WATCH
      THE OSCARS ANYMORE,
  BUT EVERYONE WAS CALLING ME.
       "THE KID IS MAKING
   A MOCKERY OF YOUR NIGHT."
  BUT YOU DID THE IMPOSSIBLE:
        YOU MADE ME LIKE
         ANNE HATHAWAY.
      I MADE SURE SHE WON
   EVERY SINGLE FUCKING AWARD
       FOR THAT "LES MIS"
     THEATER-CAMP BULLSHIT
    BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU PUT
  HER THROUGH, YOU LAZY DICK!
   BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING UP.
          YEAH, YEAH.
       YOUR UPCOMING FILM
  THAT YOU WROTE AND DIRECTED
        IS AN ADAPTATION
     OF WILLIAM FAULKNER'S
       "AS I LAY DYING."
         - ( cheering )
             - OH.
            THEY GOT
  THE FAULKNER CROWD IN HERE.
     WELL, I'M VERY EXCITED
        FOR THAT, JAMES.
        AND I MUST SAY,
      YOU KNOW, IF YOU...
          ( snoring )
    IT'S GONNA SUCK, JAMES.
     I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
   I'M REALLY FUCKIN' WORRIED
           ABOUT YOU.
 YOU KNOW HOW WHEN PEOPLE TALK
    ABOUT JOHN WILKES BOOTH,
      THEY GO, "YOU KNOW,
    HE USED TO BE AN ACTOR."
          I FEEL LIKE
  YOU'RE GOING DOWN THAT ROAD!
YOU'RE GONNA START A FOREST FIRE
      THAT KILLS 20 PEOPLE
          WHILE MAKING
  AN EXPERIMENTAL VINE VIDEO.
        AND FROM THEN ON
     PEOPLE ARE GONNA SAY,
           "YOU KNOW,
      THAT FUCKING PSYCHO
         USED TO ACT."
       I JUST DON'T KNOW
       WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
      I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
      TO BE A MOVIE STAR,
          MAKE MONEY,
 HANG OUT WITH THE SPIDER GUY.
         AND YOU SAID,
  "NAW, I WANNA BE AN ARTIST."
      WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
   WHAT I TOLD RICHARD GRIECO
        20 YEARS AGO...
          "PLAY BALL,
      YOU SQUINTY FUCK...
    OR YOU WILL DISAPPEAR!"
           AND POOF!
           HE'S GONE!
    AND YOU'RE NEXT, FRANCO!
    SO WHAT I NEED FROM YOU,
        JAMES, ARE HITS,
LIKE WHEN YOU PLAYED THE BAD GUY
      IN "21 JUMP STREET."
   OH WAIT, THAT WASN'T YOU.
  THAT WAS YOUR LESS-RETARDED
     YOUNGER BROTHER DAVE!
             DAVE.
        THAT SOUNDS LIKE
 A MADE-UP BROTHER NAME: DAVE.
      "HEY, JAMES FRANCO'S
        GOT A BROTHER."
       "WHAT'S HIS NAME,
         DAVE FRANCO?"
   IN CLOSING: GIVE ME HITS,
     DROP THE ARTIST SHIT,
      AND TAKE YOUR MONEY
         AND FUCK OFF.
       I HOPE YOU ENJOYED
          YOUR ROAST.
    I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOUR
  SHITTY DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.
          GOOD NIGHT.
   YOU'RE WELCOME. COME HERE.
  - I AM VERY EXCITED TO HEAR
 WHAT OUR NEXT ROASTER'S VOICE
 SOUNDS LIKE FOR THE FIRST TIME
          IN MY LIFE.
         PLEASE WELCOME
        NATASHA LEGGERO.
   - THANKS, "HONEY JEW-JEW."
       LOOK AT THIS DAIS:
          JONAH HILL,
     SETH ROGEN, JEFF ROSS,
   ANDY SAMBERG, NICK KROLL.
 I FEEL LIKE THE HOT COUNSELOR
        AT HEBREW CAMP.
  THE ROOM IS BUZZING TONIGHT,
  AND NOT JUST FROM THE FLIES
    AROUND AZIZ'S RELATIVES.
    JONAH HILL, I LOVED YOU
     AS A BASEBALL ANALYST
        IN "MONEYBALL,"
       AND I LOVE YOU AS
 ROSIE O'DONNELL IN REAL LIFE.
         JONAH WAS BORN
    AND RAISED IN HOLLYWOOD,
       AND YOU CAN TELL.
      HE'S A NAME-DROPPER
         WITH BIG TITS
    AND AN EATING DISORDER.
 - THAT'S A FUCKING GREAT JOKE.
        - ANDY SAMBERG.
        HI, HOW ARE YOU?
     ANDY'S COMEDY GROUP IS
   CALLED THE LONELY ISLAND,
       WHICH IS HOW EACH
       OF HIS TEETH FEEL.
       - I GOT 'EM FIXED.
  - ANDY, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
  TO THE SAD ACOUSTIC VERSION
       OF "DICK IN A BOX"
       AT LORNE MICHAEL'S
      OPEN-CASKET FUNERAL.
        - WHAT IS THIS?
         - NICK KROLL!
             NICK!
        YOUR FAN MUST BE
    SO EXCITED YOU'RE HERE!
           NO, NICK,
      I LOVE "KROLL SHOW."
 YOU ARE AMAZING AT CHARACTERS.
   YOU'RE LIKE A CHAMELEON...
 IN THAT YOU HAVE HIDEOUS SKIN
       AND BULGING EYES.
    BILL HADER, YOU ARE THIS
  GENERATION'S PHIL HARTMAN...
           HOPEFULLY.
    - JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.
      - ( audience moans )
      - SARAH SILVERMAN'S
  HAD MORE UGLY MEN INSIDE HER
        THAN COMIC-CON.
    KIM KARDASHIAN IS HERE.
        OH, THAT'S AZIZ.
             SORRY.
      I GET 'EM CONFUSED,
 THEY'RE BOTH BROWN NARCISSISTS
      RIDING KANYE'S DICK.
        NO, AZIZ IS ONLY
        IN SHOW BUSINESS
     BECAUSE HE'S TOO UGLY
         TO BE A GENIE.
      MY THIRD WISH, AZIZ,
   IS THAT YOU STOP SCREAMING
       YOUR PUNCH LINES.
      I SAW YOUR SPECIAL.
  IF I WANTED TO GET YELLED AT
     BY A HUMORLESS INDIAN,
      I'D READ A MAGAZINE
          AT 7-ELEVEN.
  NO, THEY LOVE AZIZ IN INDIA.
    HE WAS RECENTLY AWARDED
    INDIA'S HIGHEST HONOR...
             SOAP.
        JAMES FRANCO...
  ACTING, TEACHING, DIRECTING,
WRITING, PRODUCING, PHOTOGRAPHY,
     SOUNDTRACKS, EDITING...
       IS THERE ANYTHING
          YOU CAN DO?
   NO, AT FIRST I WASN'T SURE
 WHY JAMES WOULD DO THIS ROAST,
         AND THEN I SAW
  "SPRING BREAKERS" AND I WAS
 LIKE, "OH, HE'LL DO ANYTHING."
  JAMES HAS A NEW REALITY SHOW
   COMING OUT ON THE OVATION
         NETWORK... WOW.
   FINALLY SOMETHING SO AWFUL
   THAT EVEN T.L.C. WAS LIKE,
       "NAH, WE'RE GOOD."
  JAMES, YOU'RE HARD TO ROAST.
   I MEAN, YOU'RE SO DREAMY.
  I MEAN, SOMETHING ABOUT YOU,
    I JUST WANNA PLEASE YOU.
     I JUST WANNA TAKE YOU
     BACK TO MY HOTEL ROOM,
   TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES
    AND LET A MAN FUCK YOU.
   NO, I'LL FUCK YOU, JAMES.
     I JUST WANNA PUT A BAG
   OVER YOUR CAREER CHOICES.
   YOU'RE A FANTASTIC ARTIST.
   THANK YOU, I FEEL HONORED
     TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.
           THANK YOU.
     - COMING UP IS THE MAN
 WHO MADE S.N.L. FUNNY AGAIN...
          BY LEAVING.
  PLEASE WELCOME ANDY SAMBERG!
        - HEY, EVERYONE.
        SO, UH... I JUST
     FLEW IN FROM NEW YORK
   AND BOY, ARE MY ARMS FINE!
   BECAUSE SETH ROGEN GAVE ME
   A RIDE ON HIS PRIVATE JET.
      WAY TO BE THOUGHTFUL
   AND GENEROUS WHEN YOU HAD
NOTHING TO GAIN FROM IT, PUSSY.
          I'M KIDDING.
  SUPER APPRECIATE THE HOOKUP.
 BUT SERIOUSLY, SETH, WHAT'S UP
    WITH YOUR GIGANTIC TUX?
        I'D BE SWIMMING
        IN THAT THING...
        IF I COULD SWIM!
   BURNED YOU! I CAN'T SWIM.
      ROASTMASTER... CHECK.
           LET'S SEE,
   WHO ELSE SHOULD I LAMPOON?
    WOW, LOOK AT THIS DAIS...
 A WORD I KNEW BEFORE TONIGHT.
       SOMEONE MUST HAVE
       TOLD THE PRODUCER
     THAT THIS WAS A PANEL
   OF KENNY ROGERS ROASTERS,
      'CAUSE YOU GUYS ARE
      A BUNCH OF CHICKENS!
           THANK YOU.
IT'S A CHICKEN-BASED RESTAURANT,
       I RESEARCHED THAT.
  THE "LOVELY" SARAH SILVERMAN
            IS HERE.
   I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
SARAH, BUT YOU'RE GETTING OLDER.
    AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS
     GETTING OLDER? MY MOM.
I'M SCARED SHE'S GONNA DIE SOON.
   WHAT'S THAT GONNA BE LIKE?
          ROASTED YOU.
         ROASTED SARAH.
  OKAY, WHO'S MY NEXT VICTIM?
              HUH.
    NATASHA LEGGERO IS HERE.
  SHE'S, UH... SHE'S BASICALLY
      A COMPLETE UNKNOWN,
 BUT TONIGHT WE'RE GETTIN' PAID
 THE SAME AMOUNT OF * MONEY!
        UH AH, GOT YOU.
   WELL, GUESS WHAT, NATASHA?
YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING I CAN DO,
   BUT I CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE
    THE MIRACLE OF BIRTHING
     A CHILD. ROASTED YOU.
          ROAST-AFARI.
       LIKE A REGGAE GUY.
    HERE'S ONE: NICK KROLL,
   BILL HADER, AND SETH ROGEN
        WALK INTO A BAR.
  THEY'RE THERE TO PICK ME UP
  BECAUSE I'M AN ALCOHOLIC WHO
   CAN'T MANAGE MY FEELINGS!
      NAILED YOU FUCKERS!
          SUCK A BUTT!
  UH, IS THERE A BARISTA HERE?
'CAUSE THIS ROAST JUST GOT DARK!
       ( clears throat )
           WHO ELSE?
   WHO ELSE WANTS THE WRATH?
         MY GOOD FRIEND
      AZIZ ANSARI IS HERE.
         AZIZ'S PARENTS
    ARE FROM INDIA AND HE'S
      FROM SOUTH CAROLINA.
   HEY, AZIZ, WHAT'S IT LIKE
  TO HAVE A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE
        ON WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE AMERICAN, YOU BAG OF SHIT?
  ROASTING SO HARD RIGHT NOW.
   IT'S LIKE AT BOSTON MARKET
            IN HERE,
      'CAUSE I'M ROASTING
ALL THESE KENNY ROGERS CHICKENS.
      JONAH HILL IS HERE.
 JONAH IS SO DUMB THAT WHEN HE
HAD ME OVER FOR A DINNER PARTY,
    I OVERSTAYED MY WELCOME
  AND HE PRETENDED TO BE TIRED
           SO I WOULD
     LEAVE WITHOUT GETTING
       MY FEELINGS HURT.
    YOU A PASSIVE-AGGRESSIVE
       SWEETHEART, JONAH!
     JUST ASK ME TO LEAVE.
     BUT I DID WANNA STAY.
       WHO ELSE IS HERE?
             UH...
            OH YEAH,
          GOD IS HERE.
    GOD IS EVERYWHERE, OKAY?
        HE WALKS WITH ME
   THROUGH SUNSHINE AND RAIN.
HE PROTECTS ME FROM TEMPTATION.
        HE IS MY LIGHT.
      ROASTED THE FATHER!
     ON THE SACRILEGE TIP.
        EXPECT LETTERS,
        COMEDY CENTRAL.
 IF YOU DON'T WANT CONTROVERSY,
       YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
       INVITED THE KING!
             WHOO!
        AND NOW WE COME
        TO JAMES FRANCO.
       EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
        TALKING ABOUT...
         - ( laughing )
        - THANKS, BILL.
       IT'S MY OLD HOMEY.
        HEY, EVERYONE'S
    ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT HOW
  GOOD-LOOKING YOU ARE, JAMES.
     AND THEY ARE SPOT ON.
       YOU'RE SO HANDSOME
         YOU REMIND ME
    OF THE MAN WHO BROKE UP
     MY PARENTS' MARRIAGE.
      BAM, BOSTON MARKET!
 DID YOU KNOW JAMES FRANCO WAS
     ON "GENERAL HOSPITAL"?
      A CRAPPY SOAP OPERA!
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T LET YOUR EGO
         GET IN THE WAY
     OF YOUR ARTISTIC PATH.
  WHAT IS THAT, KENNY ROGERS?
  "OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL"?
       MORE LIKE A MOVIE
      THAT TRANSPORTED ME
    TO A MAGICAL WONDERLAND.
       GOOD ONE. THANKS.
    HEY! HERE'S A FUN FACT:
          JAMES FRANCO
        HAS A TINY DICK.
        YEAH, I SAID IT.
    JAMES'S DICK IS SO SMALL
     THAT I HAD TO SUCK IT
    FOR, LIKE, THREE HOURS
     JUST TO GET HIM HARD.
  AND THEN IT GOT WAY BIGGER.
        LIKE, SCARY BIG.
    I WAS LIKE, "YOU WANT ME
     TO DO WHAT WITH THAT?"
    ANYWAYS, HE RAILED ON ME
   UP THE ASS, UP AND INSIDE
         OF MY ASSHOLE
       WITH HIS GIGANTIC
   "PLANET OF THE APES" COCK.
             HUH...
     JAMES IS SO BAD IN BED
      THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN
   CLEAN HIS JIZZ OFF MY BACK
      WHEN HE'S FINISHED.
           TALK ABOUT
       CHIVALRY IS DEAD...
       A GENTLEMAN, SIR,
          YOU ARE NOT!
       AHHH... YOU GUYS,
      DON'T BE HOMOPHOBIC.
     SERIOUSLY, IT'S 2005.
            GROW UP.
          HEY, JAMES,
          KNOCK KNOCK.
         - WHO'S THERE?
      - I THINK ABOUT YOU
        WHEN I JERK OFF.
     HEY, GUYS, CAN YOU TRY
   AND SETTLE DOWN OUT THERE?
  I'M TRYING TO ROAST UP HERE.
  I DON'T GO DOWN TO YOUR JOB
 AND KNOCK JAMES FRANCO'S DICK
        OUT OF MY MOUTH.
           YOU NEVER
    TAKE ME ANYWHERE, JAMES!
    I SUCKED YOUR DICK, MAN!
      SO THESE ARE CLASSIC
          ROAST JOKES.
        JEFF ROSS KNOWS
    WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
       YOU MELTING HIPPO.
            LOOK...
       ALL I'M SAYING...
    ALL I'M SAYING IS THIS:
     JAMES HAS FORCE-FED ME
          SO MUCH DICK
  THAT YOU CAN MAKE FOIE GRAS
        OUT OF MY LIVER.
      THAT'S A FOODIE JOKE
          ABOUT DICKS.
 YOU GUYS, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT.
  LET'S ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS.
  AND, JAMES, YOU ARE A SUPER
  STRANGE GUY AND I LIKE THAT.
       BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD
    EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BE
     BORING AND YOU DIDN'T.
          SO CONGRATS.
   AND CONGRATS TO ALL OF US
     FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT
AND BEING SO MEAN TO EACH OTHER,
    BECAUSE IT'S A TRADITION
    AND WE'RE ALL TERRIFIED.
           THANK YOU.
       - OUR NEXT ROASTER
        COULD HAVE BEEN
   IN THE MOVIE "LIFE OF PI,"
     BUT PRODUCERS THOUGHT
THEY'D GET A BETTER PERFORMANCE
     OUT OF SOMEONE WHO'S
     LITERALLY NEVER ACTED
        IN ANYTHING EVER
       IN HIS WHOLE LIFE.
  PLEASE WELCOME AZIZ ANSARI.
         - ( applause )
          - THANK YOU.
  THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYONE.
        THIS IS SO COOL.
    I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER DONE
  ANY OF THESE ROASTS BEFORE.
     BUT HEY, THEY TOLD ME
    THIS ROAST IS DIFFERENT.
           YOU KNOW,
    THEY GOT A CONTEMPORARY
      RELEVANT CELEBRITY,
   JAMES FRANCO, AND THEY GOT
HIS ACTUAL FRIENDS TO ROAST HIM.
        VERY COOL IDEA.
   IF THAT'S THE PLAN THOUGH,
         WHY AM I HERE?
   I DON'T KNOW JAMES AT ALL.
          YOU GUYS SAW
       "THIS IS THE END."
       I'VE BEEN UP HERE
      LONGER THAN I WAS IN
       "THIS IS THE END."
       THE FUNNIEST PART
   OF "THIS IS THE END" TO ME
      IS IF JAMES ACTUALLY
        HAD THAT PARTY,
         I DON'T THINK
   I WOULD HAVE BEEN INVITED.
    NATASHA LEGGERO IS HERE.
    - ( scattered applause )
      - AND YES, NATASHA,
      SOMETIMES IN MY SET,
           I DO YELL.
        AND SO WOULD YOU
     IF YOU TOURED FOR MORE
      THAN TENS OF PEOPLE.
            - YEAH!
       - BUT NATASHA HAD
       A FANTASTIC SET.
          IT'S... YEAH,
       THAT WAS SO FUNNY.
    IT'S A SHAME SHE DIDN'T
   SAY HER JOKES EIGHT TIMES
         SLOWER THOUGH
     SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAD
      A CHANCE TO CATCH IT
   WHEN THEY FAST-FORWARD HER
        ON THEIR D.V.R.
     THIS IS MY IMPRESSION
        OF NATASHA'S SET
       AS IT WILL BE SEEN
    ON MOST TELEVISION SETS:
     "LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
        NATASHA LEGGERO.
   ( mimics fast-forwarding )
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, JAMES."
      JONAH HILL IS HERE.
         - ( applause )
             - YES.
    I DO THINK ONE DAY JONAH
      WILL WIN AN OSCAR...
      MEYER HOT-DOG EATER
    OF THE MILLENNIUM AWARD.
 LOOK THIS GUY IS A HUGE STAR.
        HE'S HANGING OUT
      WITH THE BRAD PITTS
   AND THE LEONARDO DiCAPRIOS
         OF THE WORLD.
      IF I WAS HANGING OUT
        WITH THOSE GUYS,
    YOU THINK I'D STILL GET
    BRUNCH WITH NICK KROLL?
       NO, OF COURSE NOT.
THAT'S HOW SUCCESSFUL JONAH IS.
   HE HAD TO GET NEW FRIENDS.
   THAT'S MY NEW CAREER GOAL,
 TO NEVER SEE NICK KROLL AGAIN.
    SARAH SILVERMAN IS HERE.
 SOME OF THE GUYS HERE TONIGHT
    REALLY TAKING ME TO TASK
    OVER ONE KANYE WEST JOKE
    I DID IN MY STAND-UP ACT
        FIVE YEARS AGO.
  IF ANYONE WANTS TO MAKE FUN
      OF ANY JOKES SARAH
      DID FIVE YEARS AGO,
         PLEASE DON'T.
 SHE'S STILL DOING THOSE JOKES.
   ALSO, I THINK IT'S SO COOL
     THAT SOME OF YOU GUYS
WERE ABLE TO TRAVEL BACK IN TIME
       TO 1995 FOR THOSE
     INDIAN JOKES YOU DID.
        THAT'S SO COOL.
              MAN!
       THOSE STEREOTYPES
        ARE SO OUTDATED.
            MY GOD.
   THERE'S MORE INDIAN DUDES
         DOING SITCOMS
         THAN THERE ARE
       RUNNING 7-ELEVENS.
  WE'RE STRAIGHT UP SNATCHING
    ROLES FROM WHITE ACTORS.
      MY LAST THREE ROLES
   WERE RANDY, CHET AND TOM.
      JEFF ROSS IS HERE...
     'CAUSE HE NEVER LEFT
     SINCE THE LAST ROAST.
   HE HAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.
          IT'S SO SAD.
 HE LIVES IN THE DRESSING ROOM.
  BUT HEY, JEFF IS REALLY GOOD
       AT ROASTING, OKAY?
     EVEN IF THEY CANCELED
   THE COMEDY CENTRAL ROAST,
 YOU'D STILL SEE JEFF OUT THERE
     SOMEWHERE ROASTING...
 A DEAD RAT OVER A GARBAGE FIRE
    BECAUSE HE'D BE HOMELESS
     AND HE'D NEED TO MAKE
  A NICE DINNER THAT EVENING.
 I SAW JEFF AT THE COMEDY CLUB
        THE OTHER NIGHT.
    A WOMAN COMES UP TO HIM
        AND SAYS, "HEY,
 IF YOU'RE WHO I THINK YOU ARE,
    I'M DEFINITELY SLEEPING
       WITH YOU TONIGHT."
          AND HE GOES
  "HELL YEAH, I'M JEFF ROSS."
  AND SHE GOES, "OOPS, SORRY.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE MAIN ORC
 FROM 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS.'"
    I WROTE THAT JOKE BEFORE
 YOU DID THAT TO YOUR HAIR TOO.
         BUT WE'RE HERE
       FOR JAMES FRANCO.
              YES.
         - ( cheering )
  - SO MANY GAY JOKES TONIGHT.
          WOW, SO MANY
    GAY JOKES ABOUT FRANCO.
  APPARENTLY IF YOU'RE CLEAN,
          WELL-DRESSED
      AND MILDLY CULTURED
     YOU'RE SUPER GAY NOW.
          IS THAT WHY
      THE REST OF YOU GUYS
      ARE SO AGGRESSIVELY
         FAT AND DIRTY?
 YOU THINK IF YOU READ ONE BOOK
       AND TAKE A SHOWER,
      DICKS ARE JUST GONNA
      FLY INTO YOUR FACE?
      FRANCO, I DON'T KNOW
         YOU THAT WELL,
          BUT I'M GLAD
        YOU HAD ME HERE.
       AND LATER TONIGHT,
      I'M LOOKING FORWARD
     TO YOU COMING UP HERE
  AND DOING WHAT YOU DO BEST...
       BEING MILDLY FUNNY
  READING MATERIAL SETH ROGEN
      HAS WRITTEN FOR YOU.
   THANK YOU GUYS VERY MUCH.
 - ALL RIGHT, OUR NEXT ROASTER
   VERY CLEVERLY CAME DRESSED
    AS ONE OF THE CHARACTERS
      FROM JAMES'S FILMS.
       HERE HE IS DRESSED
  AS THE HOT-AIR BALLOON FROM
  "OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL,"
         JEFFREY ROSS!
         - WHOA-OH-OH!
      HOW YOU GUYS DOIN'?
           I LOVE IT.
      WHAT AN EPIC NIGHT!
  FIRST OFF, I'D LIKE TO THANK
      MY NIECE SETH ROGEN
          FOR HOSTING.
         OH MAN! I SAW
      YOUR MALL COP MOVIE.
      WHAT WAS IT CALLED?
    - "OBSERVE AND REPORT."
            - YEAH.
       IT MADE ME REALIZE
   HOW FUNNY KEVIN JAMES IS.
      HOW MANY PEOPLE SAW
       "THIS IS THE END"?
         - ( cheering )
        - AWESOME MOVIE.
      I LOVED ALL YOU GUYS
     IN "THIS IS THE END."
         I REALLY DID.
     YOU PLAYED YOURSELVES,
       THAT WAS SO COOL.
     HOW'D YOU GUYS YOU GET
     INTO CHARACTER ON SET?
       DID THEY PASS OUT
   SMOOTHIES THAT TASTE LIKE
     JUDD APATOW'S ASSHOLE?
LOOK AT THESE FAT GUYS LAUGHING.
           I LOVE IT.
     IN "THIS IS THE END,"
     JONAH HILL GETS RAPED
           BY A DEMON
     WITH A BIG BLACK COCK!
      THE COCK DIDN'T HAVE
      TO BE BIG OR BLACK,
          BUT YOU KNOW
    JONAH WITH HIS DEMANDS.
     ACTUALLY JONAH ALMOST
    COULDN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT
     BECAUSE HE HAD TROUBLE
 FINDING A TUXEDO THAT CHANGED
  IN SIZES EVERY THREE HOURS.
              OOH!
         JONAH, YOU'RE
       AN AMAZING TALENT.
           I LOVE YOU
    AS THE KU KLUX KLAN GUY
     IN "DJANGO UNCHAINED."
     THAT WAS A GREAT ROLE.
  YOU SHOULD WEAR A SHEET OVER
   YOUR FACE IN EVERY MOVIE.
         WHAT WAS THAT,
       A CALIFORNIA KING?
          IT WAS BIG.
  WHEN JONAH'S AGENT TOLD HIM
     THAT QUENTIN TARANTINO
        WANTED HIM TO BE
    IN A SPAGHETTI WESTERN,
        JONAH WAS LIKE,
   "YOU HAD ME AT SPAGHETTI."
          JONAH HILL!
         JONAH HILL...
          WHAT'S THAT?
      - SPAGHETTI WESTERN.
      - SPAGHETTI WESTERN.
         YOU LIKE THAT?
         - I LIKE THAT.
      - I LOVE YOU, JONAH.
       YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.
  - I FUCKING LOVE YOU, DUDE.
- GREAT TO SEE SARAH SILVERMAN.
      SHE'S THE GREATEST.
       SO FUNNY TONIGHT.
  YOU'RE LIKE A SISTER TO ME.
      I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,
    SARAH, FOR YOUR SUCCESS
     IN THE ANIMATED MOVIE.
 ANYBODY SEE "WRECK-IT RALPH"?
              WOW.
       WHICH IS WHAT GUYS
       DO TO YOUR PUSSY.
         THEY WRECK IT,
        THEN THEY RALPH.
          BILL HADER.
  HOLY MACKEREL, SO HILARIOUS.
        THAT WAS GREAT.
      TOO BAD YOU CAN'T DO
     AN IMPRESSION OF A GUY
  WITH TWO EQUALLY SIZED EYES.
       MAN! LOOK AT THAT!
        GET A CLOSE-UP!
   I'VE HEARD OF A LAZY EYE,
      BUT THAT LEFT ONE'S
    COLLECTING UNEMPLOYMENT.
  AZIZ, I WANTED TO MAKE SOME
JOKES ABOUT YOU BOMBING TONIGHT,
 BUT YOU WERE SO GODDAMN FUNNY
       I CAN'T AND, UH...
    I MEAN, SERIOUSLY, AZIZ,
        YOU WERE HIL...
          ( ululates )
          ...LARIOUS.
AZIZ HAS BEEN CHARMING AUDIENCES
     AND SNAKES FOR YEARS.
    AND I GUESS YOU'RE HERE
 TONIGHT BECAUSE NOW THAT KANYE
        HAD A REAL BABY,
  HE DOESN'T NEED YOU ANYMORE.
     HOW YA DOIN', FRANCO?
   YOU LOOK LIKE JOHNNY DEPP
          WITH LUPUS.
DOES RYAN GOSLING EVER CALL YOU,
START LAUGHING AND THEN HANG UP?
     FRANCO IS HALF ITALIAN
        AND HALF-ASLEEP.
  HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR JAMES'S
     GRANDMA, 91 YEARS OLD.
    BEAUTIFUL. LOOK AT HER!
              WOW!
         "127 HOURS" IS
     HOW LONG SHE HAS LEFT.
       - ( crowd moans )
      - GET HIM, GRANDMA.
            GET HIM.
            GET HIM!
      - OH... OH, FRANCO.
          FRANCO COMES
 FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, RIGHT?
   YOUR FIRST JOB WAS WORKING
         AT McDONALD'S.
  IT WAS THE LAST TIME ANYBODY
   EVER SAID ABOUT YOUR WORK,
        "I'M LOVIN' IT."
        OH. AND BECAUSE
       YOU'RE AN ACADEMIC
   I TREATED THIS ROAST LIKE
      A RESEARCH PROJECT.
   I WATCHED ALL YOUR FILMS.
      I READ YOUR POETRY.
          I EVEN HAVE
     ONE OF YOUR PAINTINGS
    HANGING IN MY FIRE PIT.
       YOU KNOW, FRANCO,
    PERSONALLY I DON'T CARE
IF YOU FUCK GUYS OR FUCK GIRLS.
  ALL I KNOW IS YOU FUCKED ME
  OUT OF 12 BUCKS WHEN I WENT
TO SEE THAT WIZARD OF OZ MOVIE.
      THE WHOLE TIME I WAS
 IN THE THEATER I WAS THINKIN',
       "THERE'S NO PLACE
          LIKE HOME."
    BUT, FRANCO, I'M REALLY
        LOOKING FORWARD
 TO YOU MUMBLING YOUR REBUTTAL
    AT THE END OF THE SHOW.
         ARE YOU READY
      TO BRING IT, FRANCO?
        LET'S HOPE YOU...
   THAT'S GOOD. I'M PSYCHED.
      LET'S HOPE YOU BRING
  SOME OF THAT RAZOR-SHARP WIT
          YOU BROUGHT
         TO THE OSCARS.
     YOU WERE A WORSE HOST
     THAN THE AIDS MONKEY.
        FACE IT, FRANCO,
     YOU AND ANNE HATHAWAY
        HAD THE COMEDIC
  CHEMISTRY OF TRAYVON MARTIN
     AND GEORGE ZIMMERMAN.
        ANYWAY, FRANCO,
     I REALLY DO ADMIRE YOU
         BECAUSE YOU'RE
     A CREATIVE RISK-TAKER
  DURING A TIME WHEN THE WORLD
      NEEDS MORE OF THAT.
         SO I WISH YOU
    CONTINUED SUCCESS AND...
        I HOPE I WASN'T
        TOO MEAN TONIGHT
  BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND AND I
      BOTH WANNA FUCK YOU
        AFTER THE SHOW.
           ALL RIGHT,
       GOOD LUCK, BUDDY.
- ( instrumental music playing )
    - ALL RIGHT! IT IS TIME
    FOR THE MAN OF THE HOUR.
           GET READY.
         ARE YOU READY?
     HE'S BEEN SITTING HERE
      FOR HOURS SQUIRMING,
    WAITING FOR THIS TO END.
        SO NOW HE KNOWS
   HOW WE FEEL WHEN WE WATCH
    ONE OF HIS PIECE-OF-SHIT
      INDEPENDENT MOVIES.
       PLEASE WELCOME UP
  MY GOOD BUDDY JAMES FRANCO.
       - * JAMES FRANCO
        * JAMES FRANCO,
         JAMES FRANCO *
         * I SAY JAMES,
       Y'ALL SAY FRANCO *
        * JAMES FRANCO,
         JAMES FRANCO *
         * I SAY JAMES,
       Y'ALL SAY FRANCO *
        * JAMES FRANCO,
         JAMES FRANCO *
    - * FRANCO, FRANCO...
          - THANK YOU.
       I DO THINK THIS...
  THIS IS TRULY MY PUNISHMENT
        FOR THE OSCARS.
      AMERICA AND THE REST
          OF THE WORLD
  CAN HAVE A CATHARTIC MOMENT
        AFTER THIS AIRS.
          AND I WANNA
     THANK EVERYBODY HERE.
     THANK YOU FOR COMING.
       I HAD NO IDEA WHAT
    YOU WERE GONNA BE INTO.
     AND, JONAH, THANK YOU
        MOST OF ALL! I...
       WHEN YOU SAID YES,
       I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
       YOU WERE GONNA BE
    LISTENING TO THESE JOKES
         FOR TWO HOUR...
         I HAD NO IDEA
     WHAT A FRIEND YOU ARE.
         - I LOVE YOU.
      - I LOVE YOU, JONAH.
           THANK YOU.
   I AGREED TO DO THIS ROAST
 BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING I'D NEVER DONE BEFORE,
       SOMETHING THAT HAS
      ZERO ARTISTIC VALUE,
 SOMETHING NOBODY WILL REMEMBER
     THREE MONTHS FROM NOW,
  SOMETHING THAT'S OFFENSIVE,
          HOMOPHOBIC,
       STARS HORRIFICALLY
       UNTALENTED PEOPLE,
         AND SOMETHING
     THAT'S ONLY A BIG DEAL
          TO A HANDFUL
       OF TEENAGE STONERS
          ON TWITTER.
       NOW YOU MIGHT SAY,
    "BUT, JAMES, DIDN'T YOU
JUST DESCRIBE 'YOUR HIGHNESS'?"
        I WOULDN'T KNOW.
 I DIDN'T SEE "YOUR HIGHNESS."
   AND YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
      SEE "YOUR HIGHNESS"?
     BECAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY
       WORKING, CREATING,
   WRITING POETRY, PAINTING,
    MAKING INDEPENDENT FILMS
   AND BUILDING PSYCHO-SEXUAL
       EDIBLE BIRDHOUSES.
        AND DESPITE ALL
 OF MY AMAZING, INSPIRING WORK,
     I'VE HAD TO SIT HERE,
   LISTEN TO YOU GUYS LAUNCH
     VICIOUS ATTACKS AT ME,
      AND ALL OF THEM ARE
     COMPLETELY UNFOUNDED.
        YOU'RE GONNA SAY
    I SUCKED AT THE OSCARS.
         I WAS A GENIUS
         AT THE OSCARS.
     THAT WAS EXPERIMENTAL
       TUXEDO-SLEEP-ART.
      NOW YOU'RE GONNA SAY
       I'M A PRETTY BOY.
          - ( cheers )
      - AND YOU DON'T KNOW
      HOW PAINFUL THAT IS.
      I'M ALWAYS TYPECAST
       AS THE SAME GUY...
           YOU KNOW,
      THE HANDSOME WIZARD
    AND HANDSOME METH DEALER
        AND THE HANDSOME
     CLUMSY AMPUTEE HIKER.
   JUST ONCE I'D LIKE TO PLAY
   SOME OF THE DIVERSE ROLES
 THAT NICK KROLL GETS, LIKE...
    THE RAT-FACED ATTORNEY,
  OR THE RAT-FACED MAITRE D',
        OR THE RAT-FACED
  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DOCTOR.
        AND YOU'RE GONNA
       SAY I'M EFFEMINATE
JUST BECAUSE I FEEL COMFORTABLE
    IN A FLOWING BALL GOWN.
     I MEAN, IF I'M WEARING
        THE HIGH HEELS,
    HOW AM I NOT GONNA WEAR
       A BEAUTIFUL GOWN?
     AND I KNOW THAT I LOOK
      TERRIFIC AS A WOMAN.
    AND I'M CERTAINLY DOING
       A BETTER JOB OF IT
    THAN THAT GUY OVER THERE
  DRESSED AS SARAH SILVERMAN.
      NOW SETH WAS REALLY
       HILARIOUS TONIGHT,
    BUT THE JOKES SUGGESTING
        THAT I WAS GAY...
    COMING FROM YOU, SETH...
        IT REALLY HURTS!
     BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME
     OF THE TIME ON THE SET
     OF "PINEAPPLE EXPRESS"
        WHEN SETH ROGEN
       TRIED TO RAPE ME.
         FORCED HIS WAY
     INTO MY DRESSING ROOM,
  BLEW POT SMOKE INTO MY MOUTH
      P... AND HE PINNED ME
      BENEATH HIS SWEATY,
     HEAVING, SHLUBBY BODY.
   LUCKILY HE WAS DISTRACTED
  BY THE SOUND OF AN ICE-CREAM
        TRUCK OUTSIDE...
         AND I MANAGED
         TO BREAK FREE.
    BUT, SETH, THE INCIDENT
     DID INSPIRE MY LATEST
       PAINTING ENTITLED
         "SETH ROGEN IS
     A GAY STONER RAPIST."
     NOW YOU SAY YOU DON'T
     UNDERSTAND MY MOVIES?
    WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
           MY MOVIES.
    IN "OZ," I WAS FOLLOWED
     AROUND THE WHOLE TIME
 BY AN EXCITABLE LITTLE MONKEY
    DRESSED LIKE A BELLBOY.
       WHY WAS HE DRESSED
        LIKE A BELLBOY?
        WELL, WHAT AM I
        ASKING YOU FOR?
       AZIZ, WHY WERE YOU
    DRESSED LIKE A BELLBOY?
     ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GUYS
     THINK I'M PRETENTIOUS.
  WELL, JAMES FRANCO ADDRESSED
 JAMES FRANCO BEING PRETENTIOUS
  IN HIS BOOK "JAMES FRANCO."
    BUT IT'S... ( snickers )
     BUT IT'S NOT JUST ME.
  LOOK AT HOW FULL OF HIMSELF
      JONAH'S BECOME SINCE
     HIS OSCAR NOMINATION.
          DON'T FORGET
   WHERE YOU CAME FROM, PAL.
          SURE, YOU'RE
     BUDDIES WITH BRAD PITT
      AND CHANNING TATUM,
      BUT I WAS YOUR FIRST
        HANDSOME FRIEND.
         BEFORE YOU GET
   TOO COCKY, REMEMBER, I WAS
   THERE IN "THIS IS THE END"
 WHEN YOU WERE GETTING BRUTALLY
   ASS-RAMMED BY THAT DEMON.
          WE BOTH KNOW
     THE ONLY WAY THE DEMON
    COULD KEEP HIS ERECTION
       WAS BECAUSE HE WAS
       THINKING ABOUT ME.
     SO ALL NIGHT I'VE HAD
     TO SIT HERE AND LISTEN
      TO EVERYONE'S JOKES,
    PRETENDING TO BE AMUSED
    BY THEM, BUT IN REALITY
   THE JOKE'S ON ALL OF YOU.
      THIS IS NOT A ROAST.
      THIS IS MY GREATEST,
         MOST ELABORATE
     ART INSTALLATION EVER.
        I'M NOT THE REAL
         GUEST OF HONOR
        AND THESE AREN'T
         REAL COMEDIANS
       AND WE'RE NOT EVEN
       ON A REAL NETWORK.
    WHAT YOU'VE SEEN TONIGHT
    WAS MY BRILLIANT OPUS...
          TO SEQUESTER
     AN ARTISTIC VISIONARY
AND SUBJECT HIM TO THE MINDLESS
      INCOHERENT TRASHINGS
 OF A SCATTERING OF MISCREATED,
   TALENTLESS ABNORMALITIES.
           I CALL IT
       "GENIUS UNSCATHED"
          AND THIS IS
        MY MASTERPIECE.
          THERE'S ONLY
      ONE THING MISSING...
         MY SIGNATURE.
           THAT SAYS,
    "JAMES FRANCO, BITCHES."
           THANK YOU.
          GOOD NIGHT!
      - * FRANCO, FRANCO
       * FRA-FRA-FRANCO,
         JAMES FRANCO *
    * JAMES FRANCO, FRANCO
       * FRA-FRA-FRANCO,
       JAMES FRANCO... *
