    - You shouldn't do that.
         Tap the glass.
       - How did you know
         I was going to?
   - You must forgive my son.
         He loves bees.
 - It isn't a bee. It's a wasp.
    Different thing entirely.
         - Was that him?
   - Ah, the prodigal returns.
              Ooh.
        - Outside, Roger.
  You know you're not allowed.
Like having a Welsh pony.
      Will you be going up
         to your study?
        - No, not as yet.
      Ah, yes. Home again.
           Home again.
           Mrs. Munro!
    It would appear we've had
    a decrease in population.
    Did Mr. Healy not come by
   to take care of the apiary
       whilst I was gone?
   - Yes, but he won't be able
       to do it next time.
    - Did Mr. Healy say that?
     - No, his daughter did.
     She's taken him to live
 with her. Too feeble, she said.
       - Is he too feeble?
      - Seemed spry enough.
        Chattier, maybe.
           - With you?
        - With himself.
       - Key to the study.
         Is that lunch?
              - Mm.
- Hmm...
       <i> Watson had married </i>
        <i> and I was alone. </i>
<i>In fact, it was on the very day </i>
    <i> he left Baker Street </i>
    <i> that the case which was</i>
<i>to be my last began to unfold. </i>
  <i> It was almost 30 years ago. </i>
    <i> The Great War had ended </i>
        <i> and the tourists </i>
 <i> had come back to Baker Street </i>
       <i> to catch a glimpse </i>
  <i> of the real Sherlock Holmes. </i>
  <i> Thankfully, in his stories, </i>
  <i> Watson had always published </i>
         <i> a false address</i>
    <i> for our actual quarters. </i>
 So you found the right address.
       Why did you do it?
             - Sir?
     - Break into my study.
           My study is
      my sanctum sanctorum.
         Private place.
   - Before you went to Japan,
  I saw you writing that story.
I didn't know you wrote stories.
     - Oh, Dr. Watson, yes,
       he was the writer.
 - Well, so I borrowed Mum's key
    and went into your study,
        and there it was.
  - And how much did you read?
  - Just to where you stopped.
     It was a good part too.
  A man comes to Baker Street.
            You say,
 "You've come about your wife."
       How could you tell?
      Did you do the thing?
   - What thing would that be?
   - "The cane shows the marks
        of a dog's teeth.
   The wood is from an island
     southwest of Madeira."
           That thing.
    - And how would you tell
       that a man's visit
       was about his wife?
   - He wears a wedding ring?
              - No.
 The clues are all on that page.
   This sentence, to be exact.
    - "One day, into the room
        came a young man,
        in newly-pressed,
  albeit inexpensive clothes."
The clothes are freshly-pressed.
    He's a young man, though.
     Not expensive clothes.
 Then his wife must press them.
    Men don't have the talent
       and he can't afford
       a servant to do so.
          - Very good.
      - That's how you knew
     it was about the wife.
           - Well, no.
     When you're a detective
 and a man comes to visit you...
  it's usually about his wife.
      - So why did you stop
         where you did?
            - Ahh...
   Ah, did you get the things
        from the chemist?
           - On order.
  Said it would be a few days.
   - We'll hold them to that.
Otherwise, triumphant, were you?
         - Like V-E Day.
       Oh. Doctor's here.
- Did you catch cold in Japan?
       - Does it sound it?
 - I thought you might be coming
 off the tail end of something.
    Lost some weight as well.
             - Hmm.
         - Did you find
   what you were looking for,
   the mysterious ashy prick?
- Prickly ash.
        - Oh, yes, sorry.
 That was the reason the fellow
invited you to Japan, wasn't it?
   Dig up a pile of the stuff,
        smuggle it home?
      - It can't interfere
with anything you've prescribed.
 But surely it can't do me ill.
     - In and of itself, no.
    - You mean there might be
          side effects?
           - Perhaps.
           - Such as?
            - Hope.
 What was the name of the fellow
    who invited you to Japan?
      You just spent a week
          with the man,
      corresponded with him
           for months.
     Do you recall his name?
   There's a flat adjacent to
my surgery that's gone to let...
              - No!
  - What happens when you don't
 recall where the telephone is,
          or you forget
      to turn off the gas?
      You can't live alone.
      - I don't live alone.
     I have the housekeeper.
       - Take this diary.
    Each day you don't recall
        a name or place,
     make a mark on the page
      for that day's date.
        - And if I forget
        to make the mark?
            Oh... Mm.
   No, no, no. No. No, no, no.
    - It's the royal jelly.
          - Yes, well,
   we're not using it anymore.
            Instead,
    we're going to use this.
    It's called prickly ash.
          - Is it food?
             - Mm...
       - Eurgh. Looks like
   it came out the down-spout.
      - It came from Japan.
- That makes all the difference.
  - You add it in as you would
        the royal jelly,
    in the tea or the coffee.
       And you should try
         cooking with it
  to enhance your specialities.
          - Mr. Holmes?
           Mr. Holmes?
         Tamiki Umezaki.
        Welcome to Japan.
        I am so honoured
you have accepted my invitation.
  We spend tonight at my house.
  Tomorrow we begin our search.
     I have owned your book
          for 20 years.
       I purchased my copy
when it first appeared in print.
 I hope you'll do me the honour
   of a personal inscription.
      - Oh, yes. Of course.
              Um...
          Mr. Umezaki,
      how close to the city
   does the prickly ash grow?
          - It is found
      mostly near the sea.
          - And how far
      shall we have to go?
      - Where I am thinking
 is two days' journey by train.
       You are very eager?
- I'm in the middle of a project
     that I'm keen to finish
       and my wits must be
       at their sharpest.
  I want to be able to benefit
         from the effect
      as soon as possible.
       - It's that urgent?
        - I fear it's so.
 - You are very great detective!
     - Thank you very much.
    - My mother, she wonders
       if you have brought
        your famous hat.
    - Oh, the deer stalker.
    That was an embellishment
       of the illustrator.
      I've never worn one.
         - And the pipe?
       - I prefer a cigar.
         I told Watson,
 if I ever write a story myself,
      it will be to correct
   the million misconceptions
         created by his
      imaginative licence.
  - Did you write such a story?
 - But I'm trying to do so now.
     I must finish with you
          before I die.
         "So you've come
        about your wife."
<i>"You've come about your wife." </i>
        "You've come..."
             Roger.
              Here.
    I'll see you after lunch.
   I'm going to need some help
         with the bees.
 So you found the right address.
  - A friendly porter at 221B.
   - It's just a minor fiction
     to mislead the curious.
          Most of them
      seem to be American.
    Have a seat, Mr. Kelmot.
              So...
  you've come about your wife.
       - How did you know?
      - It doesn't matter.
  Tell me what you have to say.
     - My wife is named Ann.
 Her mother died in childbirth.
    Her father was a colonel,
     killed in that business
         at Waziristan.
       <i> We wanted very much</i>
       <i> to have children. </i>
    She lost our first child
      in her third month...
   <i> Our second in her fourth. </i>
       <i> We were told it was</i>
  <i> too dangerous to try again. </i>
     <i> Ann was... distraught. </i>
        It was as though
        each of them lost
     had been a real child,
        as opposed to...
           Thank you.
           For a time,
    she even insisted I have
   a pair of headstones carved
and placed in our cemetery plot,
       as if their bodies
      were buried beneath.
    She was in desperate need
     of something to soothe
   this dangerous melancholy.
 She liked music so I suggested
       the glass armonica.
         - The armonica?
          - My father's
     most prized possession.
    <i> He played it constantly </i>
     <i> till the day he died. </i>
<i>I had it brought to the house </i>
          <i> and arranged</i>
  <i> a month's worth of lessons. </i>
       <i> One hour per week. </i>
        Soon Ann asked me
          if she could
      increase the lessons
        to twice a week.
        Then three times.
        Then every day.
-<i> So, she took up the avocation </i>
    <i> you hoped she would. </i>
  Why are you here, Mr. Kelmot?
          - Mr. Holmes,
       my Ann has changed.
  And it isn't just the lessons
        or her obsession
      with the instrument.
<i>One day I was outside the room </i>
          <i> and suddenly</i>
      <i> her playing stopped. </i>
     <i> And I heard her saying,</i>
        <i> quite clearly... </i>
         - Grace? James?
       - Those were to be
   the names of your children?
    - When I confronted Ann,
         she denied it.
         So I forbad her
      playing the armonica
        and I forbad her
       taking the lessons.
   The woman who teaches them,
        Madame Schirmer,
           is a person
      of dangerous beliefs.
     - The dangerous beliefs
       of a music teacher?
   - She's put a spell on Ann,
          preying upon
     her weak frame of mind,
  for what reason I cannot say.
    - Have you proof of this?
- Following my instructions,
       she stopped seeing
        Madame Schirmer.
    I received in the post...
 three receipts from the woman.
      Each for the payment
     of one armonica lesson.
      Again Ann denied it.
      Consequently, my wife
     is no longer permitted
to withdraw money from the bank.
 <i> Then yesterday, I followed Ann</i>
       <i> to the place where</i>
  <i> the woman gives her lessons. </i>
   <i> Even on the pavement below </i>
   <i> I could hear her playing. </i>
   <i> Naturally, I went inside,</i>
 <i> but the Schirmer woman said, </i>
    "Your wife is not here."
  Last night, I questioned Ann.
 - And she said that she hadn't
been to Madame Schirmer's rooms.
        - Not for weeks.
          - Do you have
    a portrait of your wife?
  I shall take your case if you
 answer just one last question.
          - Certainly.
         - What perfume
      does your wife wear?
            - Roger?
           It's late.
 Lights out like it's the Blitz.
          Look at you.
    Do you remember your dad?
- I remember him holding my hand
    and taking me to the sea.
    - You're not remembering.
       That's the picture.
           What about
     the invisible stories?
     Some nights at bedtime,
 your dad would make up stories.
        He'd... he'd say,
     "Give me three things."
         And you'd say,
   "A ball, a cat and Roger."
         So then he'd...
     he'd make up some tale
      about a ball that had
     a pet cat named Roger.
       Always a something
    and something and Roger.
       You don't remember
  any of the invisible stories?
          - No. Do you?
     - I was never any good
           at stories.
           Sleep well.
<i> The first thing</i>
 <i> to know is there's no danger. </i>
     Bees aren't interested
         in harming you.
       Their only concern
      is self-preservation.
         - From people?
    - They're much too clever
           for people.
 Their enemies are the weather,
     disease and predators.
        The wasp is their
     particular antagonist.
   Did you know that one wasp
     can kill 40 honey bees
       in under a minute?
         In consequence,
      we do not like wasps.
           - Yes, sir.
      We do not like wasps.
              - Ah.
   The queen runs the colony.
  The drones service the queen.
            Hands up.
      Workers do the work.
        As it should be.
    Of concern is the latest
 decrease in the bee population.
  We've identified the problem,
    and now we must solve it.
    Right. There you are.
           Off you go.
   - Have you ever been bitten
            by a bee?
            - Stung.
     Bees don't have teeth.
          Yes, I have.
   - Well, not often, though.
         - 7,816 times.
        I keep a record.
  You're not entirely dreadful.
      - You ever been bit?
  - No. I have never been bit.
  - Well, people work with bees
    all the time, don't they?
     - What is royal jelly?
   - It's a special secretion
       of the worker bees.
     And it's royal because?
      - It feeds the queen.
            - Bravo.
       It was the jelly's
         curative powers
   that prompted my monograph,
    The Value of Royal Jelly
    with Further Comments
on the Potential Health Benefits
         of Prickly Ash.
         - What's that?
       - Prickly ash, hmm?
 Well, in Japanese,<i> hire sansho </i>
       is the common word
   for<i> zanthoxylum piperitum. </i>
       It's used to treat
 various degenerative diseases.
      Anaemia, circulatory
 conditions... arthritis and...
     Hmm. What's it called?
          Oh. Senility.
      That was a witticism.
  The newest research suggests
        that prickly ash
      has far more promise
        than royal jelly.
     Henceforth, prickly ash
   is all that we should use.
     - Have you written more
   about the man and his wife?
       - All in good time.
          - Is it real?
          - Of course.
    Fiction is worthless!
    - The place you stopped.
     Why do you want to know
       the wife's perfume?
- Cameo Rose, is it?
- Yes.
    - Always leaves a trace.
Madame Schirmer.
    Madame Schirmer, this is
    Thomas Kelmot. Let me in.
        Madame Schirmer!
   -<i> Herr</i> Kelmot, I did warn!
            You come,
 I call the Metropolitan Police!
            - Madame,
   my friend's emotional state
 is such that, if denied entry,
      he might not be able
    to restrain his passions.
      Allow us both in, and
I will take full responsibility.
       Thank you so much.
         - Who is this?
- This gentleman is a detective.
    -<i> Ja?</i> His badge, please?
           - His name
     is Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
   - You don't mind if I close
  this, do you? Such a draught.
   - No. I have seen Sherlock
    Holmes in the magazines.
   With the hat and the pipe.
    It was never this person.
       - Madame Schirmer,
   I saw Ann enter this place,
    I demand you produce her.
    - Your wife is not here.
   - You said that last time.
    - You question my truth?
        Oswald, my dear,
      it is a wish to know
   if you are this man's wife.
              - No.
   - You could be in disguise.
       - I don't think so.
            -<i> Voilà! </i>
     It is, I believe, what
the English call a water closet.
   - She was here! I saw her!
   - Mr. Kelmot, if you insist
     on following your wife
    when you have employed me
         to do the same,
   one or the other of us will
  find himself made redundant.
        He is distraught.
         - He is a fool.
         - The armonica
      used to be thought of
        as an instrument
       of the black arts,
         said to be used
      to call for the dead.
         Something to do
 with the nature of the glasses.
    - You don't believe that,
             surely?
        - What I believe
  plays no part in this matter.
 When was Mrs. Kelmot last here?
          - Weeks now.
       - Then the receipts
    you posted to her address
   were for Oswald's lessons.
 Mrs. Kelmot is paying for them.
  -<i> Frau</i> Kelmot is passionate,
         but an amateur.
     She knew it was Oswald
        who has the gift.
   You knew she was not here.
          - Of course.
 Oswald doesn't wear her scent.
       - You are still not
        Sherlock Holmes!
       - How considerate.
       You waited for me.
      - What are you doing?
         - Trying to see
 if I can tell where I've been.
        - Don't you know?
          - Mr. Holmes
    can tell things like that
 just from looking at a person.
     - Where are you off to?
       - See to the bees!
          - You'll eat
      your breakfast first!
   Got a letter from your aunt
         the other day.
    She says there's a couple
          in Portsmouth
     opening a hotel there.
    Need a housekeeper.
       - Why would we want
     to live in Portsmouth?
   - Can't stay here forever.
           - Why not?
       - Because we can't.
     - What's in Portsmouth?
    - This couple are opening
        a hotel there...
        - You said that.
  - You'll leave the table when
you're finished and not before.
       - I'm not finished.
         - You don't eat
       that Japanese muck.
      - It's<i> hire sansho. </i>
    - I know you like working
        with the hive...
        - It's an apiary.
         - And you like
   being given responsibility,
 but I shouldn't get too close.
       - Bees don't bite.
    - I don't mean the bees.
           Mr. Holmes
     won't be here forever.
    Your aunt says this hotel
     might even take you on.
     They got porters and...
         - Have porters.
            Finished.
-<i> Chemist delivered your things.</i>
       Shall I have Roger
         open the crate?
      - No. I'll see to it
       when I'm finished.
- Yes, sir.
              Sir?
       I know Roger's been
 a help to you. He's a good boy.
    He's always been clever.
          His dad and I
    weren't the sort to know
   the things a boy like Roger
       takes interest in.
     - Exceptional children
      are often the product
    of unremarkable parents.
      - I've got a sister.
    She lives in Portsmouth.
A couple of her acquaintants are
 opening a private hotel there,
       say they're willing
    to take Roger and me on.
      - You have a sister?
  Never would have thought it.
   Is this a matter of wages?
            - No.
             - Hmm.
        I shall take this
        under advisement.
       - My mother was sad
        to see you leave.
     - I'm rather sorry now
 I didn't bring the deerstalker.
 - You said you never wore one.
          - Well, yes,
  but it would've pleased her.
   - She wanted the fictional.
        You are the real.
            - Well,
    I'm not sure that's true.
     I think I was real once
until John made me into fiction.
      And then after that,
      I had little choice.
          Play the part
      as he'd fashioned it,
  or become its contradiction.
     I'm actually quite fond
           of a pipe,
        but to smoke it,
      especially in public,
  after it became so well known
     a prop, seemed vulgar.
 - So, Dr. Watson's imagination
          changed you?
    - I've never had much use
        for imagination.
I prefer facts.
           - My father
 would bring me here as a child.
 It was designed as a miniature.
       We walk as giants.
 The stones represent the lives
      of those he has lost.
             - Oh...
         - Sherlock-san!
         -<i> Hire sansho? </i>
         - Prickly ash.
          - Mr. Holmes.
             - Hmm?
- Too late to check on the bees?
       - Not in the least.
          - Bee check!
         They're quiet.
             - Yes.
         - What happens
       when the bees die?
            - Is this
    a metaphysical question?
  - I mean, do you mourn them?
- Oh, I can't say that I've ever
        mourned the dead,
       bees or otherwise.
 I concentrate on circumstances.
         How did it die?
      Who was responsible?
   Death, grieving, mourning,
    they're all commonplace.
    Logic is rare, and so...
        I dwell on logic.
Well, thank you, kind sir.
          Night, bees.
      - Sweet dreams, bees.
     - Now, what do you say
    we go for a dip tomorrow?
          - In the sea?
             - Yes.
        - It'll be brisk.
      - Good for the blood!
- All right, then.
      - What sort of books
        do you like, hmm?
 Apart from Dr. Watson's stories
      and books about bees.
           - Those are
      all the books I have.
- Well, there's a perfectly good
   library right here, inside.
 You can take any book you like.
          - Mr. Holmes?
   Are we going for our swim?
I've already seen to the apiary.
       Are you all right?
- I'm perfectly...
          I'm quite...
         Perfectly fine.
        All right, Roger.
You go along. I'll catch you up.
        Roger! Come along
     or we'll lose the day.
           Well done.
    - The photograph is her,
            isn't it?
     The woman in the story.
             - Yes.
 - Is she why you're writing it?
        - I wouldn't say
       I was writing it...
      It's more I'm trying
        to remember it.
         Ah, thank you.
        A few months ago,
    my brother Mycroft died.
    <i> His club, the Diogenes, </i>
  <i> asked that I go up to London </i>
    <i> to retrieve his things. </i>
   <i> I was given a small chest </i>
<i>containing the Watson stories, </i>
          <i> none of which</i>
    <i> I'd ever actually read. </i>
        <i> They were as John</i>
     <i> always described them, </i>
        <i> penny dreadfuls</i>
<i> with an elevated prose style. </i>
      <i> But one of the titles</i>
      <i> piqued my interest. </i>
    <i> The story was familiar, </i>
    <i> but its ending felt very,</i>
          <i> very wrong. </i>
       <i> I'd not seen any of</i>
   <i> the cinematic depictions. </i>
   <i> But by a fortunate chance, </i>
   <i> an opportunity soon arose. </i>
<i>It's strange to see a semblance</i>
<i> of one's self 40 feet high... </i>
 -<i> I fear for my Ann's sanity. </i>
     -<i> Fear for her sanity? </i>
           <i> Dear man,</i>
<i>you should fear for your life. </i>
    -<i> Whatever do you mean? </i>
 -<i> Murder, Mr. Kelmot. Murder. </i>
<i> ...and played </i>
         <i> as a character</i>
       <i> out of pantomime. </i>
- <i> Poisoned? </i>
    <i> With what means have I? </i>
        -<i> Your armonica,</i>
        <i> Madame Schirmer. </i>
        -<i> Preposterous! </i>
   -<i> Or rather, the glasses. </i>
 <i> It is the lead in the crystal</i>
<i> that creates the unique tone. </i>
     <i> Absorbed into the blood</i>
       <i> through the skin, </i>
   <i> small exposure can produce</i>
   <i> confusion, hallucinations. </i>
<i>But constant, obsessive contact </i>
<i>can end in insanity and death. </i>
<i> Every plot twist</i>
        <i> came with a twirl</i>
         <i> of a moustache </i>
            <i> and ended</i>
    <i> in an exclamation mark. </i>
<i> Our</i>
<i>would-be murderer is ingenious. </i>
       -<i> Surely you're not</i>
        <i> referring to... </i>
   -<i> I'm afraid, Mrs. Kelmot,</i>
 <i> you will have to find yourself</i>
      <i> a new music teacher. </i>
             -<i> Oh. </i>
<i> Absolute rubbish! </i>
      What possible motive
     could that German woman
      have had to kill Ann?
           That night
    I searched for something
        to jog my memory
       of the actual case.
       <i> And there it was...</i>
          <i> Her picture. </i>
   You know, a few years ago,
I could have told you everything
         about the woman
       in that photograph.
      Certainly I'd recall
     what had become of her,
     whether she was victim
           or culprit.
        But that night...
 I couldn't remember any of it.
     All I knew for certain
  was that the case was my last
         and it was why
     I left the profession,
         came down here,
    retired to my bees.
        So, I decided to
  write the story down on paper
 as it was, not as John made it.
   Get it right before I die.
- You're not going to die.
            - Roger.
             I'm 93.
      - I had a great uncle
      who lived to be 102.
          - Well, then,
       that seals my fate.
        What are the odds
    that you would know
     two men who would live
           that long?
        - Well, I didn't
       actually know him.
      I'll see to the bees.
         Ow! Mr. Holmes!
          - Mr. Holmes!
         - Aargh. Aargh.
        I've been stung.
       - Unlike the wasp,
the bee always leaves its sting.
       - I must have done
        something stupid.
            - Oh, no.
          Sometimes...
    there's no reason at all.
             Right.
   Salt water, you drink that.
         Or onion juice
to prevent serious consequences.
 And no need to tell your mother
         about all this.
   We don't want to worry her,
             do we?
     - You going to go back
          to the story?
       - Is that the price
        for your silence?
          - Tight lips.
       - How considerate.
       You waited for me.
         Good afternoon.
             - Sir?
  - Tea for one in the window.
- Certainly, sir. Mind the step.
       - Ill, do you say?
 - Took all the strength he had
  just to write out the cheque.
      - There you are, sir.
          - Thank you.
       Well, here we are.
  - Have you used this before?
        - No. I haven't.
     It is highly poisonous.
 A drop will more than suffice.
          - Thank you.
        It's just Thomas
       is in such a state.
   He insisted I made certain.
      - Reassure Mr. Kelmot
that the particulars of the will
        have not changed
     since he dictated them.
 Your possessions are bequeathed
to him, as his are to you.
Thank you so much.
   It was so good to see you.
          - Excuse me.
          - Yes, miss?
Is the 8:10 the fast service?
   - The 8:10's the slow one,
       makes local stops.
And the 9:05?
    - That's the fast train,
     goes right on through.
          - All aboard!
          - Thank you.
          - All aboard.
           - Honeybees
      are attracted to you.
   It's the scent. Cameo Rose.
              - Oh.
  - She thinks you're a flower.
          Must confuse
    the little thing no end.
             May I?
              - Oh.
          - Very kind.
          Ah. The iris.
       Amazing resilience.
 Enough light and they will grow
           in the most
     uninhabitable regions,
       desert, cold, rock.
    Why do you suppose it is
     that something as small
  and insignificant as the iris
   should be so much stronger
          than we are?
 - Perhaps they're less affected
  by what goes on around them.
             - Hmm.
       Are you a botanist?
         - Amateur only.
      I am, by disposition,
           a hobbyist.
       In fact, if I may,
     there is one particular
          hobby of mine
      that might amuse you.
      I can see the future.
     Shall I read your palm?
            I promise
   I'll find nothing dreadful.
    - What about our friend?
Oh.
Oh.
           - Hmm. Hmm.
     Your parents are gone.
      Your mother long ago,
   your father more recently.
   You had love in your heart
         for someone...
  No, for more than one person.
     But they have left you,
     and your love for them
       has nowhere to go.
         You're in pain.
But you must not allow your pain
     to guide your actions.
       Where that leads...
 The lines are not so distinct.
             - Why?
    - I beg your pardon?
       - You see so much.
        Why can't you see
       what happens next?
         - The lines...
        - Yes, you said.
     Ply your parlour tricks
     elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.
             - Wait.
           I can't...
        I can't remember.
           - Mum! Mum!
          - Mr. Holmes!
        Was it the smoke
        knocked him out?
       - Could have done.
     Most likely he stood up
        too quickly
     and lost consciousness.
    It isn't the first time.
      The last housekeeper
    didn't know what to do.
      He must have decided
   to take it subcutaneously.
   - Well, now we can't leave.
              - No.
  Made sure of that, didn't he?
   - Where's the<i> hire sansho? </i>
        The prickly ash.
      - If it's not there,
     I'm sure I don't know.
     - Did you throw it out?
     - Why would I do that?
     - For spite and malice.
     - Where'd you get words
           like that?
        - The dictionary.
         - Like as not,
    he took the muck himself.
          Got burnt up
      with the rest of it.
    Those can go on the fire.
      - Did Mr. Holmes say
    you were to do this?
      - He always disposes
          of that sort.
        - How do you know
      what sort these are?
       - You want to know
       who writes to him?
      Pensioners who think
 they've solved Jack the Ripper.
  Widows who've lost their cats
   and just know he's the only
 man on Earth who can find them.
      He's the last resort
  for every lunatic out there.
    - It's not your decision.
           - It is...
    If I'm to be a full-bore
 medical staff at cook's wages.
 He's an invalid. Needs a nurse,
       not a housekeeper.
  - All he did was took a fall.
         - Your granddad
       was hale and hearty
           60 summers
      then he took a fall.
       It was three weeks
       to the day he died.
     Should be in hospital.
   That or one of them places.
    - He'll get better!
      - And the day he does
        is the day we go.
         Is that clear?
             - Hmm.
               Oh.
   - Got a letter from Japan.
     It's from Mr. Umezaki.
       - Have you read it?
        - No. Wanted to.
        - Sin of desire.
       You're a Catholic.
    - Mum says you throw out
  most of the letters you get.
 - And why do you think that is?
     - The people who write
    want you to solve things.
   If you read their letters,
       you'd want to help.
            - Oh, no.
  You give me too much credit.
            It's just
     if I were to read them,
  I'd feel obliged to respond.
    - Perhaps Mr. Umezaki's
 asking you to go back to Japan.
              - Oh.
  I'll never go back to Japan.
           - Why not?
    - Long journey, old man.
    - You made it before.
       - That was before.
      - Maybe you could get
        more prickly ash.
  - The prickly ash hasn't made
       a bit of difference
          to my memory,
            any more
    than the royal jelly did.
              Yes.
      The only inspiration
  for any sort of recollections
          has been you.
       Go on. You open it.
       He's writing to say
       his mother is dead.
      - How could you tell?
    - Mr. Umezaki swore that
he would never contact me again.
    The only thing that would
    make him change his mind
 would be a deathbed instruction
        from his mother.
     A good son always does
      what his mother asks.
          - Mr. Holmes!
  You're not to be out of bed!
          - Mrs. Munro,
    I have counted the steps
   from the bed to the window,
    from the window to the...
   - You're not to do anything
          on your own.
         You're to ring.
       - I thought it was
         an imposition.
   - It will be an imposition
    if you lose your bearings
     and end up on the floor
       for me to collect!
       - I hadn't realised
      that this had become
     an industrial dispute.
        I've been trying
   to calculate the likelihood
that we should find<i> hire sansho </i>
           in a place
   so utterly devoid of life.
      - Perhaps it is life
       reasserting itself.
<i> Hire sansho. </i>
      - How does it taste?
    - It isn't for the taste
       that we sought it.
    Ah, now, before we leave,
        there's something
     that I mustn't forget.
         I've signed it,
        as you requested.
            - Oh.
          - Not certain
     you can read my scrawl.
 - "To Mr. Umezaki, who has not
   owned this book for long."
   - You haven't had this book
          for 20 years.
    It came from the library.
    The glue mark shows
        where you removed
        the card jacket.
   You know nothing about bees
or royal jelly or prickly ash.
   - Enough to bring you here.
    During our correspondence
   over the last few months...
was my name not familiar to you?
              - No.
      - My father's, then?
         Masuo Umezaki?
   - I never knew your father.
 - He was a diplomat in London,
           years ago.
  He loved all things English.
  The first gift he gave to me
       was a cricket bat.
      The second was this.
           In English,
 so as to "assist my education."
       - "After consulting
      "with the very great
   detective Sherlock Holmes,
   "I realise it's in the best
       interests of us all
         "that I remain
    in England indefinitely.
  "You will see from this book
     "that he is a very wise
      and intelligent man,
 and that his say in this matter
  should not be taken lightly."
- We never heard from him again.
          - I'm sorry.
    - My mother is dying.
 She grew old without a husband.
       All because of you.
         - I understand.
          The last time
   you heard from your father
       was the first time
       you heard about me.
  Masuo vanished from your life
        and I arrived...
     in the form of a book.
     One replaced the other,
           as it were.
  I suggest you and your mother
   take whatever time you have
        to come to terms
   with the facts of the case.
   A man abandoned his family
   and wrote his son a story.
    He wouldn't be the first
     to cloak his cowardice
     in a flag of sacrifice.
           I'm sorry.
  But I never knew your father.
    - I shall not bother you
  any longer with my questions.
But if the prickly ash succeeds,
      you will let me know?
         - Aargh, argh!
Aargh!
Help.
              Help.
           Thank you.
I look like I've been attacked
          by the Hound
      of the Baskervilles.
         - Can't let Mum
    see you wearing that top.
              - No.
        - It's evidence.
             - Yes.
       What of? A murder?
  Oh... I've something for you.
               No.
     <i> Apis cerana japonica. </i>
   - They have bees in Japan?
   - Yes. Just like our bees.
     Only they're Japanese.
 No, it's for you. It's a gift.
        - Oh. Thank you.
-<i> Arigato,</i> as they say in Japan.
      Something the matter?
           - You lost
    another dozen bees today.
           - A dozen?
   - What do you think it is?
   - An outbreak of mortality.
       Could be a disease
     we've not seen before,
      or a sudden mutation.
    You bring up some corpses
     and we'll examine them.
           - Yes, sir!
         - And my glass.
             Study.
Should be in one of the drawers.
Roger?
             Roger?
- Mr. Holmes feels better today.
          - Is that so?
             - Hmm.
          - Mr. Holmes
      feels so much better,
      we're about to start
        an investigation.
           - Of what?
        - The crime wave
       that has done away
  with a number of our apiary's
    most prominent residents.
  - Well. If you need suspects,
   you know where to find me.
          - Mum, wait.
  I bet if we asked, Mr. Holmes
     would... do his thing.
        The thing he does
      where he tells people
     who they are and where
they've been, just from looking.
         Do Mum for her.
     - I'm sure your mother
     doesn't need to be told
        where she's been.
  - Let's not bother Mr. Holmes
    with any foolishness.
  - It's not foolishness. Here.
You come and stand in front
 of Mr. Holmes. Just like that.
      And he will tell you
       where you've been.
             Do it.
          You want her
      to turn in a circle?
 - No, that won't be necessary.
       - Turn in a circle.
       - You've been away
        most of the day.
 The soot on your dress attests
     that you went by train
         to Portsmouth,
 as all other nearby rail lines
     which might accommodate
  a return trip of this length
 are under repair or beyond it.
     In Portsmouth, you met
  the couple who run the hotel.
Your hair and nails are evidence
     that you wished to make
    a favourable impression.
     They made you an offer,
          you accepted.
        You declined tea,
   and did not see the sister
        for whom you have
     no particular fondness,
     using my indisposition
   as an excuse to hurry back.
     - It wasn't an excuse.
         - You accepted?
     - Start a week Monday.
          - Both of us?
       - We're both going.
         - She wants me
       to be a bootblack!
            - Roger!
         - She wants me
      to do what she does!
       - There is no shame
          in what I do!
 - You complain enough about it!
         Always going on
   about how hard things are.
 And you wish you had it better!
      She can barely read!
         - Go after her.
   Apologise for saying things
    that were meant to hurt.
         You were cruel!
     If you don't apologise,
       you will regret it.
    - People always say that.
      - Because it's true.
  <i> Moi, je regrette tellement. </i>
         - You regret...
           - So much!
        - Your dad hated
    what he did for a living.
      Mechanic in a garage,
    like his dad before him.
     When he got called up,
         he said to me,
            "My love,
     I'll not spend this war
     "underneath the oil pan
      of some toff's jeep.
 I'm gonna put in for the RAF."
           So he did.
           He trained.
 Scored high marks, got assigned
 to a Bristol Blenheim, Mark IV.
      Blown out of the sky.
         First time up.
          All his mates
    who worked the motor pool
  came home without a scratch.
     - I shouldn't have said
          what I said.
      - Lesson there, then.
 Don't say everything you think.
             - Look.
    - How did you find that?
         - In your desk.
        - Couldn't have.
    - The one in the corner.
    Didn't know it was a desk
       until I opened it.
    - Oh, that's not my desk,
          it's John's.
   He left it at Baker Street
when he went off to get married.
    - Yes, and there's
      a secret compartment
    containing the very glove
   you've been writing about.
    I know you say Dr. Watson
          didn't always
        get things right,
       but in the story...
       - I am not working
     on that story anymore.
  - Yes, but in Watson's story,
he does have the armonica in it.
      And the German lady.
         And that glove.
            So maybe
    he did get things right.
   - No, that's not possible.
          John had gone
   from Baker Street by then.
     - Well, then why was it
            in there?
         - I don't know!
     And if I ever did know,
        I don't remember.
    - If you can't remember,
   then why couldn't the case
       have been a success
    like Dr. Watson wrote it?
 - Because it was my last case.
      And if I'd brought it
   to a successful conclusion,
      I wouldn't have left
         the profession
   and spent 35 years here, in
this place, away from the world!
I chose exile for my punishment,
      but what was it for?
   I must have done something
        terribly wrong...
    And I've no evidence
         of what it was.
    Only pain, guilt...
  Useless, worthless feelings!
  I wish to God I'd never even
      taken Umezaki's case!
           - Kelmot's.
             - What?
        - Kelmot's case.
        You said Umezaki.
      - Roger. Tea's ready.
       Best clear this up.
           Mr. Holmes.
  Would you like your tea now?
          - Mr. Holmes?
          If you die...
   what'll happen to the bees?
       - I haven't a clue.
   One can't solve everything.
         <i> Said to be used</i>
     <i> to call for the dead. </i>
   <i> Death, mourning, grief... </i>
    <i> They're all commonplace. </i>
         <i> Logic is rare. </i>
       - The dead are not
        so very far away.
 They're just on the other side
          of the wall.
         - Now, whenever
        did you say that?
    - Ply your parlour tricks
     elsewhere, Mr. Holmes.
 My husband could never succeed
          at deception
  so long as I do his laundry.
        I don't know much
     about your profession,
     but I doubt predicting
       the future of women
    you're engaged to follow
       is common practice.
     - It was intended only
        as a means
  to achieve a desired result.
       - That being what?
    - To delay your actions.
           To keep you
      from this appointment
   you seem so eager to make.
           Even before
      I glimpsed you today,
        I'd gleaned some
        of the passionate
        feelings you have
        for your husband.
      The man who took away
      the music you loved,
    denied you the pleasures
        of your lessons,
        even refused even
    to mark a child's grave.
       All these predicted
         your antipathy.
      And then I witnessed
          your actions.
     <i> Forging his signature, </i>
   <i> drawing down his account, </i>
       <i> purchasing poison,</i>
      <i> consulting his will, </i>
       <i> planning an escape</i>
       <i> with a mystery man </i>
  <i> who was paid a handsome fee. </i>
     And all for my benefit.
        A convincing set
        of circumstances,
    signalling your intention
     to murder your husband.
       But for two errors.
       We must place blame
 on your husband for the first.
 If Mr. Kelmot had not blundered
     into Madame Schirmer's
           atelier...
<i>and so taken me from my course, </i>
      <i> you wouldn't have had</i>
     <i> to loiter on the street</i>
  <i> for such a suspiciously long</i>
        <i> period of time. </i>
     <i> But you had no choice, </i>
       <i> so loiter you did. </i>
        I would also make
         the observation
 that there is nothing about you
that signifies the type of woman
   who enjoys window shopping,
      especially the window
        of a taxidermist.
  - Was that the second error?
    - No, merely confirmation
          of the first.
   The second was unavoidable,
    and all the more damning.
     The man at the station.
      Everything about him,
          <i> his clothes,</i>
  <i> the patches on his trousers,</i>
           <i> his hands,</i>
 <i> scarred and burned with acid, </i>
   <i> announced his profession. </i>
           Stonemason.
      Money must have been
        a dire necessity,
else you would never have forged
    your husband's signature.
      The money was to pay
       for the headstones
  your husband would not allow.
      For Grace. For James.
            For you.
      Was arranging things
         to make it look
        as if Mr. Kelmot
     was the intended victim
simply to keep me off the trail?
   - When I found the card...
         I was furious.
           That Thomas
    should know me so little
  that he had need to employ a
 detective to uncover the truth.
       Then it struck me,
if anyone could understand,
        it would be you.
      Thomas thinks I'm mad
 because I speak to my children.
     He doesn't understand.
            The dead
    are not so very far away.
         They're just...
 on the other side of the wall.
     It's us, on this side,
    who are, all of us so...
            - Alone?
      I have been alone...
          all my life.
   But with the compensations
        of the intellect.
      - And is that enough?
          - It can be.
     If one is so fortunate
as to find a place in the world.
   And another soul with whom
  one's loneliness can reside.
   - Do you know a place where
  two such souls might reside?
<i> It was an offer </i>
<i>unlike any I had ever received. </i>
    <i> She wanted to share</i>
     <i> her solitude with me. </i>
  <i> It was only later I realised </i>
           <i> how fateful</i>
     <i> my decision would be. </i>
       You have a husband
         who loves you.
         Go home to him.
         - Mr. Holmes...
       You have my thanks.
 - What more, madam, could I do?
       <i> She had poured out </i>
   <i> the contents of the bottle </i>
              <i> and,</i>
  <i> with no malice aforethought, </i>
<i>poisoned the innocent witness. </i>
         <i> If it had been</i>
     <i> one of John's stories, </i>
     <i> he would have called it</i>
        <i> a foreshadowing. </i>
<i>Our time together was fleeting. </i>
   <i> Less than an hour, really. </i>
   <i> Yet her death made me see </i>
<i>that human nature was a mystery </i>
        <i> that logic alone</i>
     <i> could not illuminate. </i>
   <i> I had successfully deduced </i>
     <i> the facts of her case, </i>
        <i> but I had failed</i>
    <i> to grasp their meaning. </i>
        <i> Never had I felt</i>
    <i> such an incomprehensible </i>
    <i> emptiness within myself. </i>
      <i> Only then did I begin</i>
         <i> to understand </i>
        <i> how utterly alone</i>
      <i> I was in the world. </i>
  <i> Mrs. Hudson wrote to Watson. </i>
        <i> He came at once. </i>
    <i> He stayed with me, in our</i>
  <i> old rooms, for a month more. </i>
   <i> I told him about the case, </i>
  <i> everything in great detail. </i>
       <i> He brought me back</i>
        <i> from the brink. </i>
         <i> And then Watson</i>
        <i> wrote the story. </i>
      <i> He made me the hero. </i>
         <i> It was his way</i>
    <i> of bestowing a kindness. </i>
     <i> He knew no other manner</i>
        <i> in which to write</i>
 <i> the character he had created. </i>
     <i> After all those years, </i>
  <i> John didn't know me at all. </i>
      <i> Why he took the glove</i>
      <i> I can only surmise, </i>
  <i> was it to prevent it becoming</i>
    <i> too powerful a reminder, </i>
      <i> to keep it from being</i>
        <i> a well of sadness</i>
    <i> to which I might return? </i>
<i>But he could not bring himself </i>
    <i> to destroy it either. </i>
           <i> After that,</i>
   <i> John and I were estranged. </i>
    <i> Three years later,</i>
        <i> he too was gone, </i>
         <i> without us ever</i>
      <i> having said goodbye. </i>
       <i> And thus concludes</i>
         <i> the true story </i>
           <i> of a woman</i>
   <i> who died before her time, </i>
<i>and a man who, until recently, </i>
           <i> was certain</i>
      <i> he had outlived his. </i>
      Roger with the bees?
         - Like as not.
         - Must tell him
      something important.
        You continue with
 whatever it was you were doing.
       - You might ask him
where the watering can's got to!
          - Ambulance?
   Yes, this is Headly House.
<i> Headly? </i>
         - Yes, quickly!
     And bring some supplies
         of adrenaline.
        -<i> Headly House? </i>
     - That's right, Headly!
            - Roger?
             Roger!
             Roger?
       Oh, Roger. Oh, no!
     No, no, no, no, no, no!
        Roger. Oh, Roger!
          - Mr. Holmes?
     It's Inspector Gilbert.
           Mr. Holmes?
        - Yes, Inspector?
    - They're giving the boy
    injections of adrenaline,
     as you said to, but...
     he's not looking good.
 - He was fleeing his attackers.
         His footprints.
    Their pattern shows that
  his flight was disorientated.
The swarm must have followed him
        in their attack.
           And before
     he lost consciousness,
  his skin would have flushed,
 accompanied by burning pain...
    A drop in blood pressure,
            weakness.
      His throat and mouth
        would be swollen
         which explains
  why he didn't call for help.
  Then a drop in heart rate...
     Inability to breathe...
             Shock.
         - Did you know
    he was allergic to bees?
   - I was certain he wasn't.
   No, no! No, Mrs. Munro, no!
      You mustn't do that!
     - My son... won't wake.
       He may never wake.
 They sent me away till morning.
You didn't even have the decency
           to tell me
     what'd happened to him!
        - I didn't think
   it would make a difference.
        - I'm his mother!
        I'm his mother...
   And you stole him from me!
         He's all I had!
     And I've lost him now.
        Why wasn't it you
         they did it to?
     It should've been you!
  - The bees were not to blame.
  - They're all you care about!
    - No! I care about Roger.
   I care about him very much.
    The bees... didn't do it.
   The bees were not to blame.
        It was the wasps!
  Roger was trying to find out
   what was killing the bees.
           And he did.
    He found the wasps' nest.
       He had to stop them
      wiping out the bees.
          And so he did
    the worst possible thing.
     He tried to drown them
    with water from his can.
 - How do you know it was them?
   - Bees leave their stings.
          Wasps don't.
    There were no stings left
        in Roger's face.
     And when they attacked,
   he dropped the watering can
 and ran up to protect the bees.
  There are his footprints from
the apiary to the nest and back.
        - He was trying
        to save the bees.
             - Yes.
              Yes.
    There was a woman, once.
I knew her less than a day.
     A quarter of an hour's
          conversation.
       She needed my help.
    She needed so desperately
 to be understood by someone...
               Me.
 So, I laid out the particulars
  of her case as I saw them...
 To her satisfaction, I thought.
    I watched her walk away.
        And within hours
      she'd ended her life.
   By identifying the cause of
 her despair with such clarity,
   I'd given her carte blanche
   to do just as she intended.
        I should've done
  whatever it took to save her.
  Lie to her, make up a story.
      Take her by the hand
    and hold her as she wept,
  and said, "Come live with me.
   Let us be alone together."
       But I was fearful.
            Selfish.
       She's the reason...
     I came here to my bees,
     so that I couldn't harm
       anyone ever again.
   I'm leaving you the house.
         You and Roger.
     House, grounds, apiary,
 everything within and without.
 And as I shan't change my mind
         on this point,
     you will see, I trust,
  that it will be greatly less
  complicated for all concerned
        if the two of you
don't go off...
     ...to somewhere like...
           Portsmouth.
          - Mrs. Munro?
         Roger's awake.
       - Dear Mr. Umezaki,
       <i> I write to tell you</i>
      <i> that I have at last </i>
       <i> recalled my meeting</i>
       <i> with your father. </i>
    <i> A woman had died because</i>
  <i> I failed to solve her case. </i>
   <i> Guilt and recrimination </i>
<i>having taken their toll on me, </i>
            <i> my powers</i>
  <i> were far from at their best </i>
         <i> when I received</i>
       <i> an urgent message </i>
          <i> summoning me</i>
      <i> to the Diogenes Club </i>
             <i> to meet</i>
    <i> with my brother Mycroft. </i>
    - This gentleman has made
      an offer of service.
He wishes to work for the Crown.
    - I'm here to be tested,
           Mr. Holmes.
<i>I very much want to be of use. </i>
 Do you think that I am suited?
        - I'm sure, sir.
             - Good.
    There is one minor issue.
           Mr. Umezaki
 has a wife and child in Japan.
           He wonders
 what would be the best course.
     - Write a letter saying
 you plan to stay on in England.
      Could be a long while
       until your return.
  <i> Your father went on to serve </i>
       <i> the British Empire</i>
         <i> for many years </i>
    <i> in absolute secrecy and</i>
<i>with the greatest distinction, </i>
             from...
     the Malay... Straits...
       to the Arabian Sea.
    <i> He was a man of courage,</i>
       heart and dignity,
     <i> of whom a beloved wife</i>
       <i> and cherished son </i>
    may be deservedly proud.
        Sherlock Holmes.
              Hmmm.
         My friend John.
       My brother Mycroft.
          Mrs. Hudson.
         Masuo Umezaki.
        Maya... Umezaki.
              Ann.
    And who is that one for?
           - Me. You.
 - Well, not yet awhile, surely?
        - Did you finish
       what you had to do?
          - Yes, I did.
         My first foray
   into the world of fiction.
  One shouldn't leave this life
 without a sense of completion.
        You can use this
     in one of your stories.
        A glass, a bee...
           and Roger.
- Show me how to knock them out.
            - Go on.
  - The queen runs the colony.
            - Mm-hmm.
 - The drones service the queen.
    The workers do the work.
        - Isn't it true?
