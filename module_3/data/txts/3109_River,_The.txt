There's magic out there.
<i>Beloved television host
Emmet Cole</i>
<i>has been reported missing.</i>
We can find his ship.
We can find him.
The network will pay,
but they want every moment
on camera.
I am <i>not</i> leaving this close
to finding your father.
Now a major branch of genomics
is still concerned
with sequencing the genomes
of various organisms.
What are you doing?
Curing boredom.
It's not boring if you actually
listen to what they're saying.
<i>Which is mainly concerning
patterns of gene expression...</i>
Come on, put the phone away.
Put it away.
<i>Now the most important tools here are..
.</i> You grew up in front of cameras.
<i>The microarrays...</i>
You should be used to this.
<i>And the bioinformatics.</i>
<i>A study of the full set
of proteins...</i> -My mom.
Go ahead.
Um, I can take notes for you.
No, thanks.
I've seen your notes.
I-I can't even read
your notes.
<i>During various conditions
is called proteomics.</i>
What?
<i>A related concept is
called materiomics, which...</i>
Mom, I'm in class.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
Wait, wait.
Well, he's been out of touch
before.
He always...
<i>...Mineralized biological tissues...</i>
How long?
<i>And things like that.</i>
<i>Uh, and their effect on...</i>
Uh, okay. Um...
<i>The, uh, macroscopic function...</i>
All right, I'm getting on
the next flight.
Okay.
What's wrong?
It's my dad. He's missing.
Dad!
Emmet!
Dad!
What the hell happened here?
It's like everyone
just disappeared.
What do you think
this place is?
Could be a mission,
maybe a research facility...
biological, botanical.
I think it's drug runners,
more likely.
Something happened here, Tess.
No one's gonna blame you
if you wanna turn around.
Emmet was <i>here.</i>
I'm not turning around,
not now.
Not without him.
Dad?
Dad?
Lincoln, maybe we shouldn't make
so much noise.
What should we do?
We go in.
Whoa, mom, come on.
Whoever was here before,
they're not here now.
Someone turned it on.
Still in tune.
Hugh, Peters, and Douglas.
"Molecular genetics and genome
sequencing and synthesis."
I read these books in class
last year.
It's like they've
barricaded themselves in.
Guys, look.
Footprints.
Looks like blood.
Animals must have got in here.
No. Animals would've picked
all of this food clean.
Ugh.
The smell isn't coming
from this food.
Look.
Lincoln!
It's dad's.
Oh, my God.
Dad?!
Em?
Dad!
Emmet, are you in here?
Do you guys hear that?
It's like a buzzing sound.
It's... coming from in here.
Ugh! Ah, jeez!
Mm.
Oh!
- You all set, Sammy?
- On it.
- A.J.?
- Yeah
Let's go sell a TV show.
Tess?
Bloody hell.
Uh, Clark, I think
the maid's missing, too.
Very funny. Very funny.
Tess?
Tess.
Tess, it's me, darling.
You have to get up.
Whatever it is, I don't care.
Now listen,
I just need a minute...
Turn off the cameras, Clark.
Show's over. I'm not giving
interviews anymore.
No, no, no, no.
Listen to me.
This isn't an interview.
Tess...
You know, you've been saying
for months
that Emmet is not dead,
and everybody
has been looking at you
like you're mad...
including myself.
His beacon...
It went off
you really should answer
your phone.
When they couldn't reach you,
they called me.
Tess, the coast guard
got a signal
somewhere in the Amazon.
They didn't get
an exact location,
<i>but</i> it was his.
You might've been right
all along.
Emmet might still be alive.
Oh, my God.
Emmet.
Yeah.
What... what do we do?
How do we do this?
What... we...
We go d... we have to go
down there.
We can find him.
How... how do... Yeah.
We... we don't have the money
to mount an expedition.
I don't know how much this...
I've already raised the money.
Oh, Clark.
Ooh!
Oh!
I don't know how to thank you.
Mm.
There's just one catch.
Clark...
Those are people in there.
Those are dead bodies.
Emmet... you don't think...
it... it can't be, right?
- It can't be.
- Mm.
Well...
Someone has to go in there
and check.
A.J.
Don't even think about it.
It's a room full of Corpses.
All that in your face.
I'll go.
We have to know, right?
All right.
Here we go.
Good luck.
Jonas, you ready?
You see him in there,
I wanna know, all right?
Where are you off to, Kurt?
Whoa, what's going on?
What are you doing?
Ugh!
I'm sorry. It's just...
The smell. I-I can't.
He's not in there.
- It's me! It's me.
- Did you follow me?
I follow everyone.
You shouldn't have.
What is that, a threat?
You gonna shoot?
Shut up!
We're not alone.
There's about 20 bodies.
It's hard to tell.
More parts than bodies.
Massive avulsions,
like they were ripped off.
Other places,
there were teeth marks.
I don't know. Like, the way
they were collected,
it's like they were
piled up in place.
For what?
It's a freezer.
What do you think?
Food?
Tess, I'm sorry to be the one
to say this out loud,
but everyone in this facility
is dead.
Something did this, okay?
And it could still be here.
So please gather up everybody.
We're leaving.
No, we're not.
Clark.
Look, this is not the time, okay?
I'm trying to take care of everybody here.
You don't get to take care of anything!
I'm...
Mom, mom, mom.
He's right. We should go.
Thank you.
Where the hell is Kurt?
Kurt?
A.J.!
This place is bloody
huge. They could be anywhere.
This is an operating room.
These are genetic maps,
cellular alteration
and mutation.
It looks like they were doing
some kind
of pharmaceutical research.
A research facility
in the middle
of the bloody Amazon?
I think it's a xulo...
one of the tribesmen
who rescued Emmet.
Whoever worked here
must have found one.
No.
They killed one.
That's the symbol
on your necklace.
What's that?
I think it's... bone.
It's coming out of his back.
What the hell
was going on here?
Got someone who might know.
Rabbit? You're alive.
I was looking for Dr. Cole.
I found her hiding in a tub.
Have you seen Emmet?
Where is he?
Is he still here?
Hey, mom. Mom.
Hey!
Easy! Easy! She's in shock.
She left your father to die.
She deserves
whatever happens to her.
What's that?
They're coming.
They're hungry.
Let's go. Come on. Let's go.
Keep going.
Uh, that sounds like
it's getting closer.
Shh!
Aah!
Good news.
You can kill them.
Do you have enough bullets?
Depends how many there are.
Let's go!
Come on.
Come on, Lena! Let's go!
Let's get out of here!
Come on!
Come on, in here!
In here, come on!
Are there any outside?
Uh...
One... two... three.
They're just waiting.
Yeah? Waiting for what?
I'm gonna say dinner.
What the hell
are those things?!
Bloody hell!
Just open the door.
It'll be easier.
Did you see him at all?
I'm so sorry.
So sorry I left him.
I didn't mean to.
I just... I wanted to go home.
Listen to me, Rabbit. Was Emmet here?!
He... was he here?
Uh-huh.
In the infirmary,
when I... when I got here.
He hadn't woken up yet.
The doctors... they said
he was gonna be okay.
They were helping him
when he...
When it happened.
When what happened?
They changed.
Have you seen him since?
Tess. If Emmet was here...
No.
It doesn't mean anything.
I'm sorry we left you, Jonas.
It's not your fault.
It's Emmet's.
I let it happen.
I don't blame you.
You don't blame the sheep
for following the shepherd.
There's some damaged
video records on this laptop.
If I can recover them, maybe we
can find out what happened here,
maybe how to stop those things.
I got it.
Here, let me try.
You're really good
with the blood and the guts,
but the electronics?
Not so much.
And this battery's not gonna
last forever.
When'd you learn
how to do all this?
When we were kids, the only
thing you were into were bugs.
That wasn't the only thing.
Snakes.
And what if my dad...
What if he didn't make it?
And all this is...
It's just...
I <i>know</i> he did.
My mom's been saying
he's alive for months.
But somehow when you say it,
it feels true.
There. That should do it.
File's clear.
Open it.
<i>No sign
of arterial atherosclerosis.</i>
<i>No transmural infarcts.
No occlusions</i>
<i>The specimen must be over 50 with
cardiovascular system of a teenager.</i>
I think this place was a lab.
Looks like they were looking
for a cure to cancer.
In the middle of the Amazon?
Well, they didn't exactly have
the most ethical methods.
You saw that body in the tank.
They were looking for a specific
gene sequence in the xulos.
Watch.
<i>No sign
of arterial atherosclerosis.</i>
<i>No transmural infarcts.
No occlusions.</i>
<i>The specimen must be over 50</i>
<i>with the cardiovascular system
of a teenager.</i>
They managed to isolate
part of the variant gene
and recombine it
into a retrovirus.
When it was ready,
it was meant to act as a cure.
But this is where it goes bad.
<i>Oh, Hanna, good. I need
a transport ready right away.</i>
This woman comes in... I think
she's their head of security.
<i>Then it's true.
You did it.</i>
<i>I'll fly the sample back
to the main labs for review.</i>
<i>Hanna what are you doing? Hanna!?</i>
Wait. Wait. No!
<i>No!</i>
<i>The sample's still reactive!</i>
<i>The viruses! Clear the room!</i>
<i>Clear the room!</i>
Only the people inside the room
were exposed.
That's at least five doctors
and the head of security.
It must've got out,
killed the rest.
Records show there were
at least 60 people here.
Shh.
Hey.
The girl in that video...
was the girl in the picture with you.
What the hell
was she doing here?
Huh? Look, what the hell
are <i>you</i> doing here?
What is that?
A signal mirror.
It's coming from the infirmary.
Maybe someone's trapped
in there.
They must've heard us.
They're trying to signal us.
It's Emmet.
<i>Excuse me.
Aren't you...</i>
<i>You were the girl on that show.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>
<i>I can't believe it's you.</i>
<i>So... you work here now?</i>
<i>Is there something
I can help you find?</i>
<i>No, I just...</i>
<i>I used to watch that show
all the time.</i>
<i>Uh, I'm sorry
about Dr. Cole.</i>
<i>Me, too.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>They're still out there.</i>
<i>Who's still out there?</i>
<i>My dad, Emmet.
They're still alive.</i>
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please.
H-how do we know that
that's Emmet out there?
Who else could it be?
If Rabbit survived,
so can Emmet.
We have to get over there.
And go through
all those bloody monsters?
No way.
The ones in the hallway...
they're leaving.
They... they... they do that
sometimes. They just disappear.
10 minutes, m-maybe... maybe 30,
but never long enough to leave.
Yeah, well, where are
they going? What are they doing?
I... is there another way
to get to the infirmary?
There's tunnels
that connect the buildings.
Let's do it.
It's clear. Move.
You go first.
Go. Show us the way.
Go.
Listen.
Tess.
Wait.
Come on. We have to get out
of here.
No. It's the only way.
Let's go.
Come here.
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.
Lena.
Shh!
Come on.
Let's go.
A.J.
Where's Kurt?
Where's Kurt?
- What's he doing?
- I don't know. They just kind of...
Leave.
They won't be coming
after us. Go.
Go!
Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!
The infirmary's
up the stairs, to the left.
Emmet!
He should be right here.
It's a wind chime.
It isn't him.
Emmet's gone, isn't he?
He's dead.
Everyone was right all along.
And I...
I wanted to believe it
so badly that...
Oh.
Mom...
Linc...
I'm so sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted a second chance
for all of us.
Mom.
I don't think it's over.
Mom.
Every time we've seen
a dragonfly,
it feels like we've been
getting closer to finding dad.
Ugh.
Ugh.
What's that?
It's dad.
If you ever
find yourself thinking
that you can improve
on mother nature's master plan,
take a look around you.
Look what she does
for our friends the butterfly
and the dragonfly.
When food runs short
or there's a drought,
some of these species retreat
into a nympha stage.
They stay there for months,
years sometimes.
Just conserving resources
until a better time comes
for them to emerge.
No matter how bad
the conditions are,
nature <i>always</i> offers a way.
What is that?
Kurt, give me your knife.
Emmet! Emmet!
Aah! Oh, my God!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I got him! I got him! I got him.
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
His airway's clear.
He's got a weak pulse.
He's alive. He's alive.
He's alive! He's alive.
Clark, help me!
I guess you didn't
get 'em all, eh?
We need to leave now.
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
Kurt!
- Kurt!
- Go! Go! Go!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Go! Go! Go! Come on!
- Keep going! Go!
- Oh, my God!
Go!
Go.
Go. Go. Go. Go.
Come on!
Almost there. Almost there.
Lincoln?
Almost there.
Go!
Come over here. This way.
You found him!
Emilio, get us moving now!
There you go.
Take him. Take him.
Come on, Salsa!
Come on, buddy. Let's go.
What's wrong with you? Come on, buddy.
What's wrong with him?
It's okay. He did his job.
Let's go.
Why isn't he awake? When is he
gonna come out of this?
I don't know.
He was trapped in there for...
could've been months.
Going into that state
may have kept him alive.
But he is alive.
Yes, he is.
Thank you, mom,
for bringing me out here.
We have him back
because of you.
Hey.
You should eat something.
Oh, thanks,
but I think after today,
it's gonna take me
a little while
to get my appetite back.
So it's over.
We're going home.
Yeah, home.
It's hard to imagine.
I can't even remember
what my apartment looks like.
You in an apartment?
Doesn't feel right.
It's like a falcon in a jacket.
Uh... Lena, you should know,
back in Chicago...
I probably should have said
something sooner,
but I-I've got a... I...
Someone.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know if it's...
She was there for me
when I thought my dad died,
and I don't know what it is now,
but I just...
It's okay.
You don't have to explain.
You just have to take care
of your dad.
You've eaten.
Feeling better?
We're gonna stop
at the first village we find,
get Emmet to a hospital.
And I suggest you find
your own way from there.
Thank you.
You could have left me
back there.
And maybe you should have.
Remember that...
When the reporters
come to your door
and ask you what happened
to Emmet Cole out there.
You remember
what we did for you...
And you choose
your words carefully.
Oh, man.
You do not look well.
Look, man, I'm really sorry
about what happened,
but you gotta tell me
the truth.
Look... Cole's back.
We're on
the home stretch, right?
Once this job's over,
I'll be on to the next.
All this will be
one insane memory.
All right?
This is not for the show.
This is just for me.
I want to know what
you're really doing here.
Come on, man.
In english, please.
What's that?
Hey, hey, <i>¿que paso?</i>
How many bullets you got?
Not enough, probably.
Clark?
Tess, get in here, quick.
What's going on out there?
I have no idea,
but it doesn't sound good.
Wherever you are,
lock yourselves in.
They're back. I only saw two of them.
There could be more.
I can see one on the stern.
Lena, where's Lincoln?
Is Emmet okay?
Tess, Lincoln's right here.
What are you waiting for?
Shoot her!
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Hanna!
Hanna...
Kurt! Kill her!
Kurt!
I love you.
Lincoln, what's going on?
Kurt just took one of them out.
He said there were two.
What's with the other one?
Aah!
Oh, God!
Ohh!
So how was my funeral?
