<b>Great speech, Patty</b>.
<b>Thank you, Madam President</b>.
<b>One moment</b>.
<b>We're ready for you, sir</b>.
<b>Captain Hiller</b>.
<b>Welcome to the White House</b>.
<b>It's great to be back</b>.
<b>I cannot tell you how proud we are
to have you flying our flag up there</b>.
<b>It's an honor, Madam President</b>.
<b>Your father was a great man</b>.
<b>He'd be so proud</b>.
<b>I think you know the
Secretary of Defense</b>.
<b>Sir</b>.
<b>Nice to see you again, son</b>.
<b>I know I don't have to
introduce you two</b>.
<b>Ma'am, let's get you touched up
for photo</b>.
<b>Moving up in the world</b>.
<b>Says America's knight in shining armor</b>.
<b>Oh, you're the one that's back

<b>Yeah, as an employee I don't quite get

<b>-Captain.
-Yeah</b>?

<b>Yeah, well, I need a little more stimulation</b>.
<b>Hey, you know?
I didn't have to follow you up here</b>.
<b>Yeah, you did.
You get lonely without me</b>.
<b>I was the youngest valedictorian

<b>I could have been stationed anywhere.
Like San Diego, you know</b>?
<b>Beaches, surfing</b>.
<b>You never surfed a day in your life</b>.
<b>But I'm a fast learner</b>.
<b>And I got great balance. Like a cat</b>.
<b>Cats hate water, Charlie</b>.

<b><i>one</i></b>.
<b>Initiate uncoupling sequence</b>.
<b><i>All tugs disengage</i></b>.
<b>Do you realize that there are only
36 women on this Moon Base</b>?
<b>I'm sure one of them will eventually
come around, pal</b>.
<b>It's not like they all rejected me</b>.
<b>I happen to have standards</b>.
<b>-Whoa! What did you do?
-Nothing</b>!
<b>That didn't sound like nothing</b>.
<b>Tug-Ten collided with the weapon</b>.
<b>The clamps have stopped</b>.
<b>They're not responding, sir</b>.
<b>All tugs, take evasive action</b>.
<b><i>Pull back! Pull back</i></b>!
<b>-Charlie! It's gonna crush the base!
<i>-I said pull back</i></b>!
<b>That's a negative, sir</b>.
<b>This isn't a fighter, Jake</b>.
<b>Don't remind me</b>!
<b>Lt. Miller..</b>.
<b><i>what are you idiots doing</i></b>?
<b>I don't know, sir</b>!
<b>We're gonna die!

<b>Are you crazy? We'll burn up</b>!
<b>Yeah, that's very possible</b>!
<b>Come on</b>!
<b>Yes</b>!
<b><i>Yes</i></b>!
<b><i>It's actually working</i></b>!
<b>I honestly didn't think

<b>Oh, shit</b>!
<b>Jiang's coming in hot
and he's got that look</b>.
<b>He knows we don't speak Chinese, right</b>?
<b>That was a close call, sir</b>.
<b>You almost got us all killed</b>.
<b>Yeah..</b>.
<b>but then I saved everyone</b>.
<b>You don't get credit for cleaning up
your own mess</b>.
<b>And you destroyed one of my tugs</b>.
<b>Actually, sir, if anybody's to blame..</b>.
<b>Sir, I lost my focus.
It won't happen again</b>.
<b>No, it won't</b>.
<b>You're grounded until further notice</b>.
<b>Can I still watch TV or...</b>?
<b>-You didn't have to take the fall.

<b>I'm sorry, sir</b>.
<b>I thought you should see this</b>.
<b>Sir</b>.
<b>It started a couple of hours ago</b>.
<b>Look how their behavior changed</b>.
<b>After 20 years of being catatonic</b>.
<b>Get me Director Levinson</b>.
<b>We tried</b>.
<b>He's unreachable, sir</b>.
<b>You need to take me seriously</b>.
<b>I've been chasing you across the planet

<b>But now that I have you..</b>.
<b>Excuse me, who are you again</b>?

<b>-But I've found it's a constructive experience.
-Lloyd. Lloyd, Lloyd</b>.
<b>It's Floyd</b>.
<b>We have to meet a friend right now,
a great guy. Come say hi</b>.
<b>Where are we</b>?
<b>Director Levinson</b>.
<b>Director Levinson</b>.
<b>Who are those men</b>?
<b>It's Umbutu's rebel forces</b>.
<b>The warlord</b>?
<b>I don't think there's anything
to worry about</b>.
<b>His old man just died and I hear that
the son is much more of a moderate</b>.
<b>Hey, fellas..</b>.
<b>howdy doody. Say..</b>.
<b>I'm looking for Dikembe Umbutu</b>.
<b>I see you found their armory</b>.
<b>The one and only, David Levinson</b>.
<b>Catherine, wow</b>!
<b>What are you doing here</b>?
<b>You don't think you're the only expert
he called, do you</b>?
<b>I'm so surprised to see you,
a little bit</b>.
<b>I'm a little surprised that you
remember my name</b>.
<b>Hey, hey, come on</b>.
<b>Let's be professional</b>.
<b>We both remember what happened

<b>I'm sensing a palpable tension here</b>.
<b>We've bumped into each other
at a few conferences</b>.
<b>I bet you have</b>.
<b>Shut up, Floyd</b>.
<b>Director Levinson, I'm sorry</b>.
<b>We're not done our business here</b>.
<b>What papers</b>?
<b>It looks like this</b>.
<b>So, why does Umbutu Junior
need a psychiatrist</b>?
<b>Unresolved daddy issues</b>?
<b>His people fought a ground war
with the aliens for 10 years</b>.
<b>Their connection is the strongest
I've ever seen</b>.
<b>It's as if their mind is..</b>.
<b>-tapped into the alien subconscious.
-Yeah</b>.
<b>Your obsession with the
human-alien psychic residual condition</b>.
<b>Yeah, you calling me obsessive.
That's cute</b>.
<b>How did they get the lights on</b>?
<b>We didn't</b>.
<b>It happened on its own</b>.
<b>Two days ago</b>.
<b>Of course, you're aware that this is
the only ship that landed in '96</b>.
<b>And so, I appreciate you finally granting us
this access, Mr. Umbutu</b>.
<b>Your father was very tenacious</b>.
<b>His pride caused the death
of more than half of my people..</b>.
<b>-including my brother.
-I'm so sorry</b>.
<b>Be careful</b>!
<b>Wow</b>!
<b>What happened here</b>?
<b>They were drilling</b>.
<b>For what</b>?
<b>Man, I don't know</b>.
<b>When did the drilling stop</b>?
<b>When you blew up the Mothership</b>.
<b>Right now, for us,
any way to get up there</b>?
<b>You're not afraid of heights, are you</b>?
<b>How high is it</b>?
<b>Oh, my God</b>!
<b>That's that same pattern</b>.
<b>So the signal was coming from this ship</b>.
<b>20 years ago..</b>.

<b>I can't take it anymore</b>.
<b>Tell me how much you miss me</b>.
<b><i>Actually, the Chief of Staff

<b><i>No, I haven't yet</i></b>.
<b>It's okay. There's no rush</b>.
<b>I saw Dylan at the White House today</b>.
<b>I just think you two

<b>Captain Lao, China has been integral

<b>Is there anything you want to say

<b>I didn't want to text you.

<b>What's going on here</b>?
<b>I asked you a question</b>.
<b>Yes, sir, the floor is very slippery</b>.
<b>Be careful if I were you.

<b>I was so close to punching him back</b>.
<b>I think you made the right choice</b>.
<b>You did almost kill him..</b>.
<b>but that's why they have ejection seats</b>.
<b>No, I went too far</b>.
<b>It's the only way

<b>It was never gonna be you

<b>The last thing I said to my parents

<b>And when it fully blooms,

<b>It's going to take your breath away</b>.
<b>Can you believe it?

<b>I made you a gift</b>.
<b>I took a knitting class</b>.
<b>Is it itchy</b>?
<b>You'd tell me if it was itchy, right</b>?
<b>Oh, God</b>.
<b>You're awake</b>!
<b>Did we win</b>?
<b>Eric, bring in the medical team. He's awake</b>!
<b>Where's my glasses</b>?
<b>-I can't see.
-Oh, they're right here</b>.
<b>Oh, yeah</b>.
<b>How long was I out</b>?
<b>Long time, baby. Long time</b>.
<b>Oh, yeah. I can see that</b>.
<b>Babe..</b>.
<b>you got a bit fat</b>.
<b>And really bald</b>.
<b>But you still look great</b>.
<b>This just came in from Hubble</b>.
<b>There's some kind of force
pulling at Saturn's rings</b>.
<b>Holy Christ</b>!
<b>What about our defense base there</b>?
<b>It's gone</b>.
<b>And it's not just the base.
It's like the whole moon just vanished</b>.
<b>Up the alert level to red</b>.
<b>Right away</b>.
<b>Hey, honey</b>.
<b>Listen, I want you to pack up your stuff

<b>But this symbol comes up more often..</b>.
<b>than anything I've encountered.
Look at the similarities</b>.
<b>How can you not see the relevance</b>?
<b>No, it's not that I don't see it</b>.
<b>I just feel like right now, there are more
pressing matters than analyzing doodles</b>.
<b>Like a giant space ship turning back on</b>.
<b>-Sir.
-Yeah</b>?
<b>-We've lost all contact with Saturn.
-What</b>?
<b>-We need to notify the president.
-Already tried</b>.
<b>Tanner said he'll get back to us

<b>Bypass Tanner however you can.
We need to talk to Lanford now</b>.
<b>Right</b>.
<b>Thank you</b>.
<b>At least your father
spared the elephants</b>.
<b>Good for him</b>.
<b>Look. The Roswell crash in '47</b>.
<b>The farmer who made contact
drew the same circle</b>.
<b>And every time I interview
one of my patients and show them this..</b>.
<b>they all express the same emotion</b>.
<b>Fear</b>.
<b>I don't think it's a circle</b>.
<b>The night the ship turned on..</b>.
<b>I experienced the strongest vision
I've ever had</b>.
<b>And I drew this</b>.
<b>That's incredible</b>.
<b>How did you decipher
so much of their language</b>?
<b>They were hunting us</b>.
<b>We had to learn how to hunt them</b>.
<b>That means you're beautiful</b>.
<b>Aw, thanks, man</b>.
<b>Not you</b>.
<b>You have to remove
the sub-sonic inlets..</b>.
<b>before you can reconfigure
the thermalized plasma cartridges</b>.
<b>That's great. Why don't you put that thing down
and help me</b>?
<b>There she is</b>.
<b>-It's happening.
-God damn it</b>.
<b>The chemical reaction, the pheromones..</b>.
<b>all of the blood in my body,
it's rushing to my head</b>.
<b>Your head</b>?
<b>-I'm gonna go introduce myself.
-Yeah. No problem</b>.
<b>Shit</b>!
<b>So, you must be the pilot China sent</b>.
<b>-Did the giant flag give it away?
-It was that</b>.
<b>And the fact that I heard you
speaking Chinese earlier</b>.
<b>Anyway, I was wondering
if you wanted to get a drink</b>.
<b>Maybe fall in love</b>.
<b>Aren't you a little young for that</b>?
<b>I'm 23 and a half</b>.

<b>It was a spaceship</b>.
<b>Madam President.

<b>David, are you seeing this</b>?
<b><i>Yes, Madam President.

<b>They could be initiating an attack</b>.
<b><i>We need to strike first</i></b>.
<b><i>Hold on. Hang on a second.

<b>the design and the technology

<b>is nothing like the ones

<b><i>I'm telling you, this is not them</i></b>.
<b>And what if you're wrong</b>?
<b><i>If you're wrong..</i></b>.
<b><i>we could be starting a war

<b>At this point, we know the Saturn base

<b>Madam President, this could very well
be a coordinated attack</b>.
<b>Get the cannon into firing position</b>.
<b>Yes, sir</b>.
<b><i>We should be cautious..</i></b>.
<b><i>and listen to Director Levinson</i></b>.
<b>How does the rest of the Council feel</b>?
<b><i>Let's hold off until we know more</i></b>.
<b><i>We have to be decisive.

<b><i>I also vote to strike</i></b>.

<b>I need an answer</b>.
<b>Take them out, Commander</b>.
<b>We are locked on</b>.
<b><i>I think this is a mistake.

<b>Fire</b>!
<b>Get me an image</b>.
<b>It crashed in the Van de Graaff Crater</b>.
<b>We're not picking up any signs of life</b>.
<b>Let's hope to God
we did the right thing</b>.
<b><i>Madam President, we need to send
a team up to investigate the wreckage</i></b>.
<b><i>We need to know who we just shot down</i></b>.
<b>There's no sign of life

<b>We can send a team up,

<b>No. Can we not make this political</b>?
<b>I need to get up there and get answers</b>.
<b>David, you can lead a team up there..</b>.
<b>but after the celebration</b>.
<b>You heard the president</b>.
<b>I'll expect to see you next to us

<b><i>You want to see my best smile</i></b>?
<b>Did he just hang up on me</b>?
<b>It sure sounded that way to me, sir</b>.
<b>Where are you going</b>?
<b>Jake. I really think

<b>Okay, everyone..</b>.
<b>get out! I'm taking off</b>.
<b>Wait, wait, wait</b>!

<b>-Good job, Collins.

<b>Someone call a cab</b>?
<b>-Thanks for doing this, Jake.

<b>Seatbelts, obviously</b>.
<b>David, why don't you take a seat</b>.
<b>Where? Really</b>?
<b>What's the matter, are you nervous</b>?
<b>You know, it's not my favorite</b>.
<b>Don't worry. I haven't crashed in..</b>.
<b>a couple days</b>.
<b>But that was intentional</b>.
<b>What</b>?
<b>Okay, here we go</b>.
<b>I forgot how much I hate this</b>.
<b>That wasn't so bad</b>.
<b>I haven't kicked on

<b>And in our darkest moment..</b>.
<b>when all hope was lost..</b>.
<b>I said, "Never give up</b>.
<b>"You have to have faith.</b>"
<b>And in that moment,

<b>Jesus, it has its own gravity</b>.
<b>-What does that mean?

<b>Madam President, can you take my father

<b>Yes, of course</b>.
<b>I'm going with you, Patty</b>.
<b>Dad</b>!
<b>You're gonna need me</b>.

<b>What are those green lights</b>?
<b>The ship will touch down over the Atlantic</b>.
<b>-Which part?
-All of it, ma'am</b>.
<b>Issue an evacuation order

<b>I don't think there's time</b>.
<b>So, what's the plan</b>?
<b>We have less than 20 minutes

<b>We still have two in surgery</b>.
<b>-Get them in post-op as fast as you can.

<b>Hundred percent</b>.
<b>This, right here.

<b>Yeah, I got it</b>.
<b>Captain, they're ordering all ships

<b>There's a hundred million dollars' worth

<b>Oh, my</b>!
<b>Why did I buy this boat</b>?
<b>Glad to have you back, Mr. President</b>.
<b>Been far too long</b>.
<b>Thank you</b>.
<b>Is David Levinson here</b>?
<b>Not yet</b>.
<b>Morrison's tug is still 10 minutes out</b>.
<b>Have them meet us at the prison</b>.
<b>We need to interrogate one</b>.
<b>What the..</b>.
<b>They've gotten worse</b>.
<b>Much worse</b>.
<b>Mr. President</b>?
<b>Dr. Okun</b>.
<b>You're awake</b>.
<b>Very much so</b>.
<b>Why are they screaming</b>?
<b>No, no, no</b>.
<b>They're not screaming</b>.
<b>They're celebrating</b>.
<b>General, one of the prison cells
is docking with the chamber</b>.
<b>Where's my dad</b>?
<b>I think he went in there</b>.
<b>-Get the weapons!
-Let's go</b>!
<b>Let's go</b>!
<b>We have alien guns</b>?
<b><i>Isolation chamber activated</i></b>.
<b>How did he get in here</b>?
<b>Dad, it's too dangerous</b>!
<b>Someone get him out of there</b>!
<b>He overrode the system</b>.
<b>Sir, please unlock the door</b>!
<b><i>Don't you worry about me</i></b>.
<b>Just get as many answers as you can</b>.
<b>No, don't</b>!
<b>Whitmore locked himself in</b>.
<b>Can you hear us</b>?
<b>She has arrived</b>.
<b>Who is she</b>?
<b>She..</b>.
<b>is all</b>.
<b>What does she want</b>?
<b>What does this mean?
What does this symbol mean</b>?
<b>Why are you afraid of it</b>?
<b>It's killing him</b>!
<b>That's enough</b>!
<b>-Move!
-Kill it now</b>!
<b>Dad</b>!
<b>He's breathing</b>.
<b>Someone call a medical team</b>!
<b>Is it dead</b>?
<b>I told you</b>.
<b>You kill them from behind</b>.
<b>-Daisy, stop crying.
-She's scared</b>.
<b><i>An evacuation order..</i></b>.
<b><i>-of the southern and eastern coastal regions...
</i>-I want Mommy</b>.

<b>They're both dead</b>.
<b>Just shut up, okay? That's enough</b>.
<b>You don't even have your license</b>!
<b>Look around you</b>.
<b>You think anyone's gonna pull us over</b>?
<b>The radio said to go inland..</b>.
<b>so that's where I'm going</b>.
<b><i>Proceed in an orderly fashion</i></b>.
<b>-There's a guy in that boat!
-I am not stopping</b>.
<b>Look, he was moving</b>!
<b>-He needs our help!
-Sam, stop the car</b>.
<b>Unbelievable</b>.
<b>Hurry up, okay</b>?
<b>I think he's just knocked out</b>!
<b>I don't think it's a coincidence..</b>.
<b>that this thing showed up
just before they did</b>.
<b>-No, I think you're right.
-Brakish, you should be in bed, babe</b>.
<b>Where did you get this</b>?
<b>That's from the ship that we shot down</b>.
<b>We need to cut this open</b>.
<b><i>Director Levinson..</i></b>.
<b><i>proceed to Command Center
immediately</i></b>.
<b>Call us soon as you have anything</b>.
<b>Come on, people</b>.
<b>Move</b>!
<b>Baby, I'm so happy
that you want to dive back into work</b>.
<b>Maybe we should get you some pants</b>.
<b>Pants</b>?
<b>All right. Go on</b>.
<b>Why didn't you tell me
my butt was hanging out</b>?
<b>We have infrared of the alien ship, sir</b>.
<b>Are those dots..</b>.
<b>They all must be aliens</b>.
<b>What's that mass</b>?
<b>Enlarge this section, please</b>.
<b>That's what our prisoner alien
meant by..</b>.
<b>"she is all.</b>"
<b>Director Levinson..</b>.
<b>I have Cheyenne Mountain
and the remaining world leaders online</b>.
<b><i>David, what can you tell us</i></b>?
<b>Ma'am..</b>.
<b>they're like a hive and I think
we just found their queen..</b>.
<b>their very big queen</b>.
<b><i>This is an infrared image
of their ship..</i></b>.
<b><i>and we think that that's her,
Madam President, right there in the middle</i></b>.
<b>Christ almighty</b>.
<b><i>General Adams, we have a live feed
from a reconnaissance aircraft</i></b>.
<b>-Great. Put it up.
-Yes, sir</b>.
<b>David, is this one of their plasma drills
you briefed us about</b>?
<b>Yeah, I believe so</b>.
<b>The funnel's over a mile in diameter,
sir</b>.
<b>That's 20 times bigger than the one
in Africa</b>.
<b>I think they're after our molten core..</b>.
<b><i>which means no magnetic fields..</i></b>.
<b>our atmosphere would evaporate</b>.
<b>Basically, the end of life
on this planet</b>.
<b>So, you're saying
we're already finished</b>.
<b>Not necessarily</b>.
<b>Back in '96, the drilling in Africa stopped
when we blew up their Mothership</b>.
<b>There must have been a queen up there
that we didn't know about</b>.
<b>Assuming that this
hive theory holds true..</b>.
<b>General, if we could blow up this queen,
maybe it could work again</b>.
<b>All right, then I'm authorizing
an immediate retaliatory strike</b>.
<b>Let's do it</b>.
<b>-Scramble the fighters.
-Right away</b>.
<b><i>Attention, all pilots, report to mission briefing

<b><i>I repeat, all pilots report to mission briefing

<b>Hey</b>.
<b>Come find me after the briefing,
okay</b>?
<b>I'm so sorry, Dylan</b>.
<b>I was right there, man</b>.
<b>I just couldn't save her.
I was too late</b>.
<b>I know I'm probably the last person
you want to hear from right now..</b>.
<b>but I've been where you are</b>.
<b>I know how deep it hurts</b>.
<b>She wouldn't want you to give up now</b>.
<b>Come on, man. You got to lead us</b>.
<b>See you up there, Lieutenant</b>.
<b><i>Good afternoon</i></b>.
<b><i>This red mass on the top of the ship..</i></b>.
<b><i>that's your target</i></b>.
<b><i>We're gonna send a fleet of drones
to go in ahead of you..</i></b>.
<b><i>and disable their shields</i></b>.
<b><i>Your mission..</i></b>.
<b><i>is to fly cover for the bombers..</i></b>.
<b><i>who will be armed
with cold fusion warheads</i></b>.
<b><i>Now, the blast should penetrate
the hull..</i></b>.
<b><i>and kill that alien queen</i></b>.
<b><i>Captain Hiller will brief you
on the flight plan</i></b>.
<b>We'll all try to converge
at the same time</b>.
<b>But whoever gets to the target first..</b>.
<b>will deliver the payload</b>.
<b><i>We have to expect..</i></b>.
<b><i>that they're gonna come at us
with everything they got</i></b>.
<b><i>So, protect the bombers at all cost</i></b>.
<b><i>We all lost someone that we love</i></b>.
<b><i>So, let's do it for them</i></b>.
<b><i>Alpha strike launch in one minute</i></b>.
<b>Jake</b>.
<b>I'm coming back</b>.
<b>I promise you</b>.
<b>Make them pay</b>.
<b>We're not going up there to make friends, right</b>?
<b>I looked at the houses</b>.
<b>The one on Harrison Street..</b>.
<b>with the stone walkway</b>.
<b>If it's still there</b>.
<b>Okay, it's getting real</b>.
<b>It's getting real real</b>.
<b><i>All right, form up. On me</i></b>.
<b>It's the Fourth of July</b>.
<b>So, let's show them some fireworks</b>.
<b>I want you to give me one of your katana blades
and teach me everything you know</b>.
<b>Fine</b>.
<b>You know what?
I'll figure something out</b>.
<b>What are you idiots doing</b>?
<b>The world's going to end</b>.
<b>Even worse, we lost the gold</b>.
<b>So, we thought we'd drink a little</b>!
<b>The US Government is on the line</b>.
<b>They say the aliens are drilling
to the Earth's core..</b>.
<b>and they're looking for a ship
in the area to monitor their progress</b>.
<b>We're the only ones left</b>.
<b>Tell them we'll do it..</b>.
<b>for a hundred million dollars</b>.
<b>Look at this guy</b>!
<b>Yeah, hold on one second</b>.
<b>He's drunk</b>.
<b>They said, "It's a deal.</b>"
<b>I got it. I got it</b>.
<b>Look, Sam, they're going off road</b>.
<b>Maybe we should do the same</b>.
<b>Shit. What the hell happened here</b>?
<b>We rescued you</b>.
<b>Oh, thank you</b>.
<b>Is this really you</b>?
<b>Of course it's me. Who else would it be</b>?
<b>-What's your son like?
-Can you get us his autograph</b>?
<b>How often do you see him</b>?
<b>These days we only see each other
at Thanksgiving, but unfortunately..</b>.
<b>last year he had to cancel</b>.
<b>What about you</b>?
<b>Where are your parents</b>?
<b>Visiting our grandparents in Florida</b>.
<b>Oh, I see</b>.
<b>Where should we go, Mr. Levinson</b>?
<b>I think the safest place for all of us
to be right now is by my David</b>.
<b>Since you're the leading expert on his condition,
I really wanted you to see this</b>.
<b>How can his connection be so strong</b>?
<b>During the first attack..</b>.
<b>he was exposed to their collective mind</b>.
<b>It was completely unfiltered</b>.
<b>I need to ask him about this</b>.
<b>I already have</b>.
<b>He doesn't even remember drawing them</b>.
<b>Okay, let's try this baby on for size</b>.
<b>You know, I helped bring that thing
back from space</b>.
<b>Is there anything I can do</b>?
<b>Yeah. Back off</b>.
<b>Yeah. Of course</b>.
<b>Command, we have visual</b>.
<b><i>Roger, Captain Hiller.
Continue approach</i></b>.
<b><i>Mission is a go</i></b>.
<b>Bay-18, sir</b>.
<b>Why'd you put it all the way up there?
Give me that. Get the ladder down there</b>.
<b>Come on</b>!
<b>Couldn't leave it on a bottom shelf?
Here we go</b>.
<b>All right, coming for you, baby.
There she is</b>.
<b>What is it? An alien laser</b>?
<b>Nope</b>.
<b>It's the Okun laser</b>.
<b>Why aren't they attacking us</b>?
<b>Careful what you wish for</b>.
<b><i>There's the queen's ship.

<b><i>Maintain defensive posture</i></b>.
<b><i>Down! Down! Down</i></b>!

<b><i>Command, the queen's ship

<b><i>Dylan, that's me, 12 o'clock</i></b>.
<b>Come on. Come on</b>.
<b>Bank left</b>!
<b>Oh, God</b>!
<b>You can thank me later</b>.
<b>Hell, I'll thank you right now</b>.
<b>We just lost bomber 9..</b>.
<b>and bomber 13, sir</b>.
<b>Command, we can't get
to the top of the ship</b>.
<b>It's too heavily armed</b>.
<b>We're dropping like flies out here</b>.
<b>Come on</b>!
<b>I think we need to fly inside</b>.
<b>No, that's suicide. Sir</b>?
<b>Morrison's right. This is our only shot</b>.
<b>Do it</b>!
<b>We'll detonate the bombs

<b>and we'll give you enough time

<b><i>Copy that</i></b>.
<b>Jake, follow my lead</b>.
<b><i>I'm on your wing</i></b>.
<b><i>All bombers, we're going in</i></b>.
<b>They didn't follow us</b>.
<b><i>Form up on your leads</i></b>.
<b><i>Charlie, look at those fields down there</i></b>.
<b><i>They have their own ecosystem</i></b>.
<b>-Sir?
-Dad</b>?
<b>You have to warn them</b>.
<b>She knows that they're coming</b>.
<b><i>We got eyes on the target</i></b>.
<b><i>Tally-ho</i></b>.
<b>That's what we came here for</b>.
<b><i>All bombers, open bomb bay doors</i></b>.
<b>Get them out of there</b>!
<b>It's a trap</b>.

<b><i>Command, I have engine failure</i></b>.
<b><i>We have engine failure</i></b>.

<b>We're going down, we're going down</b>!
<b><i>I can't restart</i></b>!
<b><i>Come on</i></b>!
<b><i>We've lost all power</i></b>!
<b><i>Command, you have to trigger the bombs</i></b>!
<b><i>It's the only way</i></b>!
<b><i>Don't let us die for nothing</i></b>.
<b><i>Do it</i></b>!
<b>Madam President,

<b>Wait</b>.
<b>Something's happening</b>.
<b>She baited us</b>.
<b>Tanner, we have to have a status report</b>.
<b>We're trying. Our satellites are down.

<b>Madam President</b>!
<b>There will be no peace</b>.
<b>Careful! You'll agitate the crystals</b>!
<b>I built it back in '94</b>.
<b>Had to shelve it, though,

<b>-Here, put her over here.

<b>What is that thing doing here</b>?
<b>All right, be a good boy.

<b>Wait a second. What meltdown</b>?
<b>Are we sure this thing is safe to use</b>?
<b>Highly unlikely</b>.
<b>Clear</b>!
<b>What's the status of the fleet</b>?
<b>Only seven percent made it

<b>-Seven percent?
-Yes, sir</b>.
<b>General, Cheyenne Mountain is gone</b>.
<b>All members of the presidential line

<b>They're here to swear you in, sir</b>.

<b>We're not gonna beat them this time</b>.
<b>God, look at the line.

<b>David, you should be

<b>President Whitmore</b>.
<b>Thank God you're okay</b>.
<b>It's been a while</b>.
<b>I had 20 years to get us ready</b>.
<b>And we never had a chance</b>.
<b>We didn't last time either</b>.
<b>We always knew they were coming back</b>.
<b>But look how far we've come</b>.
<b>In the last 20 years..</b>.
<b>this planet has been unified in a way
that's unprecedented in human history</b>.
<b>That's sacred</b>.
<b>That's worth fighting for</b>.
<b>We convinced an entire generation
that this is a battle that we could win..</b>.
<b>and they believed us</b>.
<b>We can't let them down</b>.
<b>And it wasn't luck last time</b>.
<b>It was our resolve</b>.
<b>We all have to fight..</b>.
<b>till our last breath</b>.
<b>And that is gonna lead us to victory</b>.
<b>You understand some of their language</b>.
<b>I'd like you to tell me if any of these writings
mean anything to you</b>.
<b>So, okay, how about this one</b>?
<b>This talks about an intergalactic war</b>.
<b>This concerns the whole universe</b>.
<b>What about this one</b>?
<b>Something about an enemy</b>.
<b>It needs to be destroyed

<b>Wait</b>.
<b>I had a case study in Brazil..</b>.
<b>where my patient didn't describe

<b>as "fear."
He referred to it..</b>.
<b>as "enemy.</b>"
<b>Of course</b>.
<b>Their enemy is our ally</b>.
<b>Your laser's smoking</b>.
<b>Get it outta here</b>.
<b>Tell 'em to try to pull it open</b>.
<b><i>Hello, gorgeous</i></b>.
<b><i>Time to find out what secrets you're hiding</i></b>.
<b><i>All right, let's go get everyone.

<b><i>Yes, sir</i></b>.
<b>Watch your back</b>!
<b>Scorpio</b>!
<b>Come on, they're picking us up!

<b>Jake, get out of the way</b>!
<b>Guys..</b>.
<b>you really need to see this</b>.
<b>I've run every possible scan.
It's not giving off any kind of signal</b>.
<b>I mean, nothing</b>.
<b>It's like it doesn't even exist</b>.
<b>It's almost like it's trying to hide itself</b>.
<b><i>It's really smooth</i></b>.
<b>Hey, whoa</b>!
<b>You're not wearing gloves</b>!
<b>-You'll contaminate it.
-Remove your hands, Floyd</b>.
<b>That's weird. I can't</b>.
<b>What do you mean you can't? Rosenberg</b>.
<b>Okay, I'm trapped.
Somebody do something</b>.
<b>-It's swallowing me!
-Just stay calm and don't panic</b>.
<b>This thing is trying to eat me,
and your advice is not to panic</b>!
<b>Looks like they're mobilizing</b>.
<b>David, please tell me
this isn't some kind of a Trojan horse</b>.
<b>I don't think it's a danger to us</b>.
<b>But it must be to them</b>.
<b>He turned it on just by touching it</b>.
<b><i>I activated myself..</i></b>.
<b><i>when I detected
your biological signature..</i></b>.
<b><i>to be different from theirs</i></b>.
<b>It speaks</b>!
<b>In English</b>!
<b><i>I deconstructed your primitive language</i></b>.
<b>We're primitive</b>?
<b><i>Correct. My species
shed our biological existence..</i></b>.
<b><i>for a virtual one
thousands of years ago</i></b>.
<b>Far out</b>.
<b>Why are you here</b>?
<b><i>When I intercepted their distress call..</i></b>.
<b><i>I knew they would come
to exterminate you</i></b>.
<b><i>I came to evacuate
as many of you as possible</i></b>.
<b><i>But you attacked me
with the same weapons they used on us</i></b>.
<b>They attacked you</b>?
<b><i>Correct</i></b>.
<b><i>A Harvester Ship conquered our planet..</i></b>.
<b><i>and extracted its molten core</i></b>.
<b><i>They use them
to refuel their ships..</i></b>.
<b><i>and grow their technology</i></b>.
<b><i>They have done this
to countless civilizations</i></b>.
<b><i>We fought them for thousands of years..</i></b>.
<b><i>but they destroyed all of our ships</i></b>.
<b><i>I am the sole survivor</i></b>.
<b>I am so sorry to hear that</b>.
<b>Do you have a plan</b>?
<b><i>My system holds the key
to superior technology</i></b>.
<b><i>And there is a hidden planet..</i></b>.
<b><i>where I teach refugees
from other fallen worlds..</i></b>.
<b><i>how to build weapons that will
defeat them..</i></b>.
<b><i>once and for all</i></b>.
<b>That's why they're afraid of you</b>.
<b>You're the only ones
who threaten their existence</b>.
<b><i>Correct</i></b>.
<b><i>But now that I am activated..</i></b>.
<b><i>the queen will detect my signature..</i></b>.
<b><i>and hunt me down</i></b>.
<b>It's too late</b>.
<b>She's already on her way</b>.
<b>Yeah</b>.
<b>She's coming</b>.
<b>Hey, what would happen..</b>.
<b>if we were able to kill her</b>?
<b><i>No one has ever killed
a Harvester queen</i></b>.
<b>That's encouraging</b>.
<b><i>But as a hive..</i></b>.
<b><i>her fighters will fall, and her
ship will leave your planet</i></b>.
<b><i>Recalled by other Harvester queens</i></b>.
<b><i>But it's too late now</i></b>.
<b><i>You must terminate me..</i></b>.
<b><i>or she will get the coordinates
to the refugee planet</i></b>.
<b><i>And that will be the end</i></b>.
<b>Wait, wait a second</b>.
<b>If we're so sure that she's coming here
to get you..</b>.
<b>maybe we can bait her..</b>.
<b>like she baited us</b>.
<b><i>Mr. President, Dr. Okun thinks..</i></b>.
<b>that we can replicate
the Sphere's RF radiation signal..</b>.
<b>David, English, please</b>.
<b>Every computer
has a radioactive signature..</b>.
<b>whether it's your laptop, your phone,
even your watch</b>.
<b>But the Sphere has an RFR
that's completely off the charts</b>.
<b>So, if we hide the real Sphere..</b>.
<b>inside the isolation chamber..</b>.
<b>and pack this decoy transmitter,
so to speak..</b>.
<b>onto a tug
filled with cold fusion bombs..</b>.
<b>and lure her out to the salt flats..</b>.
<b>We can fly it right up her royal ass
and bon voyage</b>!
<b>You set off cold fusion bombs..</b>.
<b>you're gonna kill everyone
from here to Houston</b>.
<b>Not if we use the shield generators
from this base to contain the blast</b>.
<b>Without our shields, you better put
a blaster in every able bodied hand..</b>.
<b>and get them ready to shoot some aliens</b>.
<b>Yes, sir</b>.
<b>Now, we just need a way
to see her coming</b>.
<b>Follow me</b>.
<b>Do your thing</b>.
<b>My thing? Do my thing? My thing</b>!
<b>Take it off</b>!
<b>-Copy, sir.
-Watch it</b>.
<b>This old radar truck was supposed to go
to the Smithsonian</b>.
<b>They never picked it up</b>.
<b>It's a good thing they didn't</b>.
<b>Yeah, drive it to the highest point.
The higher, the better</b>.
<b>Yes, sir</b>.
<b>Look what I found in the hold</b>.
<b>We should be able to communicate
with this</b>.
<b>Let's hook up the antenna</b>.
<b>What was that</b>?
<b>The drill is cracking
the outer mantle..</b>.
<b>but that shouldn't happen for another..</b>.
<b>We were wrong</b>.
<b>We do not have seven hours
until the Earth core breach</b>.
<b>We only have..</b>.
<b>one</b>.
<b>Call it in</b>.
<b>Area 51, do you copy</b>?
<b><i>So, the idea..</i></b>.
<b>is to get her to follow this tug..</b>.
<b>into the salt flats..</b>.
<b>using the decoy transmitter on board</b>.
<b>And once she's taken the bait..</b>.
<b>our cold fusion bombs can go to town</b>.
<b>It's a Hail Mary</b>!
<b>But it can work</b>.
<b>There's a catch</b>.
<b>As you know, they took out
all of our satellites..</b>.
<b>which means that somebody..</b>.
<b>is gonna have to fly it in manually</b>.
<b>And I know that I'm asking
for the ultimate sacrifice. I know that</b>.
<b>But you..</b>.
<b>you are the only pilots we have left</b>.
<b>And I need a volunteer</b>.
<b>Let's get it done</b>.
<b>I'll fly it in</b>.
<b>No, you won't</b>.
<b>I'll do it</b>.
<b>Mr. President</b>.
<b>Dad, what are you doing</b>?
<b>Patty</b>.
<b>There are a lot of reasons
why I'm the best choice for this</b>.
<b>You all have to pick up the pieces
once it's over</b>.
<b>This is my part</b>.
<b>Matthew..</b>.
<b>do not let him get on that tug</b>.
<b>Do you understand me</b>?
<b>Get the hell off the road</b>!
<b>If we go any slower,
we'll be going backwards</b>.
<b>Don't be a shmuck.
We have to conserve gas</b>.
<b>Area 51 is still 75 miles away</b>.
<b>We're running on fumes</b>.
<b>What do we have here</b>?
<b>Who's in charge here</b>?
<b>No one</b>.
<b>Our driver left us
to take a ride to Minnesota</b>.
<b>Just like that? He just left</b>?
<b>He went to go have sex
with his girlfriend</b>.
<b>Yes</b>!
<b>All aboard</b>!
<b>Wait</b>!
<b>What about our car</b>?
<b>We'll get a new one
when you get your license</b>.
<b>On the bus, everybody</b>!
<b>Tell the General we're up and running</b>.
<b>Bring it in</b>.
<b>Spin it around</b>.
<b>All right, plug it in</b>.
<b>Radar is operational, sir</b>.
<b>Son of a bitch</b>.
<b>All right, they're coming in fast.
David..</b>.
<b><i>we got a real fire storm coming our way
and not a lot of time to prepare</i></b>.
<b>Give me numbers, Mr. President</b>.
<b>Nine minutes
to the queen's ship's arrival..</b>.
<b>roughly 22 minutes before the drill
reaches our molten core</b>.
<b>Jesus Christ. Take your positions</b>.
<b><i>We don't have a second to lose</i></b>.
<b>Are we gonna make it, sir</b>?
<b>You bet your ass we will</b>.
<b>All right, here we go, men</b>.
<b>Get up on that barricade</b>.
<b>Prepare to fire</b>!
<b>This thing is way cooler than a machete</b>!
<b>Sorry! Sorry, everyone</b>!
<b>That was my bad</b>!
<b>I'm gonna see if it's clear</b>.
<b>Jake</b>!
<b>Hell of a time to scare a guy</b>!
<b>Sorry</b>.
<b>-It's good to see you!
-It's good to see you, too</b>.
<b>-I didn't think you made it.
-Why not</b>?
<b>You haven't flown a fighter in a while,
so I figured..</b>.
<b>You're alive, that's what counts</b>.
<b>Enough with the reunion.
They're gonna hear us</b>.
<b>-More of us made it!
-You're still talking loud</b>.
<b>So, what now?
Go in guns blazing</b>?
<b>Hey, what are you doing</b>?
<b>You guys get to those fighters
and don't leave me hanging</b>.
<b>Wait</b>!
<b>Excuse me</b>!
<b>Down here</b>!
<b>There you go</b>.
<b>Listen, I usually don't hold a grudge..</b>.
<b>but you killed my parents</b>.
<b>So..</b>.
<b>I'm gonna make an exception
for you guys</b>.
<b>Charlie, Rain..</b>.
<b>you two take the first fighter</b>.
<b>Been holding that one for a while</b>.
<b>Their technology hasn't changed at all</b>!
<b>Get the weapons ready</b>.
<b>New interface</b>.
<b>Shit</b>.
<b>Jake's in trouble! Let's go</b>!
<b>Getting a little low there, Rain</b>.
<b>Nice</b>!
<b>No, you don't</b>!
<b>Should've kept running</b>.
<b>Get your ass out of there</b>!
<b>Take this</b>!
<b>-Oh, man.
-Hey, thanks for that</b>.
<b>Yeah</b>.
<b>Get up there where you belong</b>.
<b>What, you don't want to fly</b>?
<b>Hell, no. I wanna shoot</b>.
<b><i>All pilots, go to channel six on your radios</i></b>.
<b>Anytime, gentlemen</b>.
<b>You guys go ahead. We'll cover the rear</b>.
<b>Big closing doors</b>!
<b>Big closing doors! Jake</b>!
<b><i>Where are you</i></b>?
<b>We're on our way!
Rain, how long we got</b>?
<b>20 seconds, max</b>.
<b>No, Rain, stop! Bank left</b>!
<b>We have to go</b>!
<b>No! We're not leaving anyone else behind!
No one else dies today</b>!
<b>You with me</b>?
<b>I'm with you</b>.
<b>It's getting dicey up here</b>!
<b>Rain, just get out of here</b>!
<b>Respectfully, sir, no way in hell</b>!
<b>-Come on!
-Hey, man..</b>.
<b>I just want you to know..</b>.
<b>if we don't make it out of here..</b>.
<b>I'm really sorry for almost killing you
in training</b>.
<b>If we don't make it out of here,
I just want you to know..</b>.
<b>I'm not sorry at all
about punching you in the face</b>.
<b>Hey, way to go, Charlie</b>!
<b><i>All right, we're clear.
You lead, we follow</i></b>.
<b>Faster, Rain</b>!
<b>Faster</b>!
<b>Hang on to your seat, buddy</b>!
<b>Jake, did you make it</b>?
<b>Rain..</b>.
<b>did you see him come out of there</b>?
<b>I'm not sure</b>.
<b>Jake</b>?
<b><i>Did you miss me</i></b>?
<b>You can't do that to me</b>.
<b>I told you you'd get lonely without me</b>.
<b><i>All right, aviators,

<b>Clock's ticking,

<b>Oh, yeah</b>?

<b>What, the kid making fun of me</b>?
<b>No. That sound</b>.
<b>Oh, boy</b>.

<b>All right, Tom, we are ready to go</b>.

<b><i>Now, Tom, now</i></b>.
<b>It's working</b>.
<b>She's following the decoy</b>.
<b>Wait, what are you doing</b>?
<b>It doesn't matter. We're isolated.
I'm gonna turn it back on</b>.
<b>Why would you do that</b>?
<b>To see what else this thing knows</b>.
<b>Excuse me, just have a few questions,

<b>Sir, there's a school bus

<b>No, no, no</b>.
<b><i>David, the queen's ship will be there

<b>Who is this blind idiot</b>?
<b>Yeah! Yes, thank you</b>.
<b>Dad</b>?
<b>This is going to catapult

<b>Come, David</b>!
<b>I'm so happy you're alive,

<b>I'm a little busy right now, Dad</b>.
<b>You and I, we're gonna have to talk</b>.
<b>I said not now! Look</b>!
<b>Yeah, I see..</b>.
<b><i>Tom, it looks like the plan is working</i></b>.

<b><i>-She's only going after the fighters.
</i>-We gotta get these kids to cover. Go, go</b>!
<b><i>It's good to see you flying again</i></b>.
<b><i>Your place is in the air</i></b>.

<b>-Tom, what's going on?

<b>On behalf of the planet Earth..</b>.
<b>Happy Fourth of July</b>.
<b>Do we have confirmation, David</b>?
<b>I think it's safe to say,
Mr. President..</b>.
<b><i>that we got her</i></b>!
<b>Yes</b>!
<b>Wait, if she's dead,
why are her fighters still attacking us</b>?
<b>Command, we have a breach</b>!
<b><i>-How many do you think?
</i>-About two dozen, sir</b>.
<b><i>Under no circumstances..</i></b>.
<b>do they see the Sphere</b>.
<b>You do whatever it takes.

<b>Copy that</b>.
<b>This is Sam. My navigator</b>.
<b>You're a lot taller than I imagined</b>.
<b>This is her sister, Daisy</b>.
<b>-Sir...
-There's Bobby</b>.
<b>is that supposed to happen</b>?
<b>Not good</b>.
<b>Oh, my God</b>.
<b>She has her own shield</b>.
<b>What is that</b>?
<b>Okay, back in the bus, kids.
Back on the bus</b>.
<b>Let's go. Get back on the bus</b>!
<b>Get her</b>!
<b>Ginger</b>!
<b>-Where are you going? No, no, no!
-Come on, girl</b>!
<b>Let's go</b>!
<b>-We have to wait for the dog? I guess so.
-Hurry, Sam! Come on</b>!
<b>-Come on!
-Get in here, girl! Come back</b>!
<b>-Okay. Close the door.
-Oh, shit</b>.
<b>Oh, my God</b>!
<b>Drive</b>!
<b><i>All remaining pilots, target the queen</i></b>.
<b>Unload everything you've got</b>!
<b>Did you hear that</b>?
<b>We need back up down here, now</b>.
<b><i>We've got a serious breach

<b><i>We got aliens on the loose.
We need back up now</i></b>!
<b>Hey! Where are you going</b>?
<b>Oh, my God!
Where'd she go</b>?
<b>Sir, that thing just leapt into the air</b>!
<b>-What'd he say?
-Something about jumping</b>.
<b>Look out</b>!
<b>We are within six minutes, sir</b>.
<b><i>David, six minutes
to Earth's core breach</i></b>.
<b><i>General Adams, her shield is down</i></b>!
<b>-Yes!
<i>-I repeat, her shield is down</i></b>.
<b>Great job, Lieutenant</b>.
<b>I got you, baby</b>!
<b><i>We're gonna get you out of this</i></b>.
<b><i>Aim for her gun, Charlie.
Aim for her gun</i></b>.
<b>This is Captain Hiller</b>.
<b><i>We've hijacked a couple of alien fighters</i></b>.
<b>-Yes!
-Yes</b>!
<b>Do not shoot at us</b>!
<b>We're the ones trailing smoke</b>.
<b><i>Roger that, Captain Hiller</i></b>.
<b>Go on, get her</b>!
<b>Shoot her down</b>!
<b><i>Whitmore destroyed the queen's ship
and his daughter knocked out her shield</i></b>.
<b>Now, listen up!
They're going for our molten core</b>.
<b><i>You've got 4 minutes..</i></b>.
<b><i>to destroy the queen.
So give her hell</i></b>.
<b>Copy that. No pressure</b>.
<b>We're really running into an alien prison</b>.
<b>This is the one</b>!
<b>Open up</b>!
<b>We're here</b>!
<b>She knows</b>!
<b>She's coming</b>!
<b>Dylan, what's happening</b>?
<b>I don't know.
My controls just stopped responding</b>.
<b>Same here</b>.
<b>-Charlie, do something!
<i>-I can't</i></b>!
<b>She must have taken control
of our systems</b>.
<b><i>I think we're part of the hive now</i></b>.
<b>Looks like we're not the only ones</b>.
<b>The hell</b>?
<b>She's taking us straight to Area 51</b>.
<b>What are you doing?
You're not going to follow her</b>!
<b>-Stay behind the yellow line, please, Dad.
-There is no yellow line</b>.
<b>Imagine one</b>!
<b>Take that</b>!
<b>See</b>?
<b>Told you I'd figure it out</b>.
<b>You talk too much</b>.
<b>Baby, we're saved</b>!
<b>They got me</b>.
<b>Oh, no</b>.
<b>Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you to sick bay</b>.
<b>Don't worry. I'm not going to make it</b>.
<b>Wait a minute. Wait</b>.
<b>You can't go</b>.
<b>Who's gonna water the orchids</b>?
<b>Who's gonna make sure
you put your pants on in the morning</b>?
<b>Right</b>.
<b>I've got something I gotta tell you</b>.
<b>What</b>?
<b>This</b>!
<b>That was supposed to be a sweater</b>.
<b>Oh, no, no</b>.
<b>No. Oh, no</b>.
<b><i>What the hell is she doing</i></b>?
<b>That's close enough, David</b>.
<b>I think they're trying to protect her</b>.
<b>More are coming</b>.
<b>Give me that thing</b>.
<b>Take that</b>.
<b>Two minutes, sir</b>.
<b><i>Two minutes until core breach</i></b>.
<b>Captain Hiller, you've got two minutes</b>.
<b><i>Two minutes</i></b>.
<b>Man, we gotta get out of this tornado</b>.
<b>Every tornado has an eye, right</b>?
<b>I think if we want to get a shot at her,
we gotta get up there</b>.
<b>But how are we gonna do that?
We don't have any manual controls left</b>.
<b>Don't these things have fusion drive
or something</b>?
<b><i>Are you kidding me</i></b>?
<b>That thing is made for outer space.
Down here, we'll burn up</b>.
<b>You got a better idea, Charlie</b>?
<b><i>Because from where I'm sitting..</i></b>.
<b>it looks like it's our only damn chance</b>.
<b>Our only chance to die</b>.
<b>Charlie, shut up</b>!
<b>Rain, arm the thrusters</b>.
<b>-You're all crazy!
<i>-One..</i></b>.
<b>two, three</b>!
<b>Still alive</b>.
<b>-You all right?
-Man</b>!
<b>I got the controls back</b>.
<b><i>And our weapons are working</i></b>!
<b>Yeah, but our engines are fried</b>.
<b>All right.
It's gotta be a controlled dive, then</b>.
<b><i>There she is</i></b>!
<b>Everybody, we got one shot at this</b>.
<b><i>Let's make it count</i></b>.
<b>Thanks for always looking out for me,
Jake</b>.
<b>You got it, buddy</b>.
<b>Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa</b>!
<b>-It's over.
-You got 'em all</b>.
<b>Okay</b>.
<b>Except that one</b>.
<b>Oh, my God. She's got it</b>.
<b>Fire! Fire! Fire</b>!
<b>Get ready for a close encounter, bitch</b>!
<b>Charlie</b>!
<b><i>Go for her back right where the tentacles are!
That's her weak spot</i></b>.
<b>Keep shooting, Charlie</b>!
<b><i>What do you think I'm doing</i></b>?
<b><i>Shit</i></b>!
<b>This thing got ejection seats</b>?
<b><i>Negative</i></b>.
<b>Look out</b>!
<b>I told you not to get too close, David</b>!
<b>David, let's get out of here</b>!
<b>Back up. Go back</b>!
<b>We're alive</b>!
<b>We're rich</b>!
<b>Oh, my God</b>.
<b>General Adams..</b>.
<b><i>the Earth's core is secure</i></b>.
<b>Whoa! Look at that</b>!
<b>She's dead. We got her</b>.
<b>Whoa, whoa, whoa</b>!
<b>Baby, put the gun down</b>.
<b>Jake</b>?
<b>Jake</b>!
<b>We're not even married yet,
you're already trying to shoot me</b>?
<b>Maybe we should try that</b>.
<b>You know</b>.
<b>Dinner, first</b>!
<b>Director Levinson</b>.
<b>Well done</b>.
<b>Thank you, Mr. President</b>.
<b>Good job</b>.
<b>Catherine..</b>.
<b>Don't say anything. You'll just ruin it</b>.
<b>Who are you</b>?
<b>David never mentioned
a beautiful woman in his life</b>.
<b>Dad</b>!
<b>I'm Julius. I'm his father</b>.
<b><i>Enchant√©e.</i> I'm Catherine Marceaux</b>.
<b>-Could you give us a second?
-I was never here</b>.
<b>Listen, maybe you guys
should stay with me for a while..</b>.
<b>I think that we'd really like that</b>.
<b>Yeah, so would I</b>.
<b><i>Are you okay</i></b>?
<b><i>I am. Thanks to you</i></b>.
<b><i>This wasn't all for nothing</i></b>.
<b><i>You are a remarkable species</i></b>.
<b><i>Not so primitive after all</i></b>?
<b>You think they'll let me
keep this thing</b>?
<b>You have the heart of a warrior</b>.
<b>That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me</b>.
<b>Hell of a job</b>.
<b>We are rich! We are rich</b>!
<b>We are rich! We're wealthy</b>!
<b>I don't know if this planet
could survive another attack</b>.
<b>Excuse me, Director Levinson..</b>.
<b>you won't believe..</b>.
<b>the weapons and the technology..</b>.
<b>this thing has
on its proverbial hard drive</b>.
<b>It wants us to lead their resistance</b>!
<b>What do you mean</b>?
<b>Two words..</b>.
<b>interstellar travel</b>.
<b>Take the fight to them</b>.
<b>When do we leave</b>?
<b>We are gonna kick some serious alien ass</b>.
