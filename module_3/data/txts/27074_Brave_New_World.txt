This is how life begins...
... For all of us.
The male and female DNA
are matched
to make sure everything
comes out just right ...
The egg is fertilized;
the DNA are combined ...
and the baby starts to grow.
Before the Wars ...
men and women
would match their own DNA.
Then...
anything could happen.
That was very dangerous.
Children belonged to them ...
...like objects.
They did not value freedom
like we do today.
It was called 'Family'
We've come a long way
since then.
<i> "Today we have no crime ...</i>
<i> no disease, no war,
aging, or suffering. "</i>
<i> "Each of us is
genetically designed ...</i>
<i> to fit perfectly into
our place in society. "</i>
<i> "So everyone's happy." </i>
Very nice.
Good job, Gabriel.
I do not understand. How were children
decanted in the old days?.
The children were not decanted.
They were born.
After a woman and
a man had sex ...
the woman would get pregnant
and then give birth.
Like animals?
It's hard to believe.
It was a very painful,
dangerous and degrading experience.
So. Were they afraid
to have sex?
Sometimes.
If a man and a woman
wanted to have babies ...
They would get married.
And then they were supposed to
have sex with each other.
For how long?
Their whole lives.
You mean they were
'Mothers' and 'Fathers'?
There is no need to
use bad language.
The old system encouraged
many negative things.
Envy, deceit, possessiveness,
Children raised in bad conditions.
And they had no Soma to ease the pain.
Life was very different
before the Wars.
It wasn't until the world
was unified...
Under a rational scientifically enlightened
government that real progress could occur.
And now we live in luxury,
harmony and safety.
<i> Could there be a better time
to be alive? </i>
<i> Let the world say, thank you ...
with Soma.</i>
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>
<i>And we all have fun:
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta...</i>
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else. </i>
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>
<i>I am so glad I'm an Alpha...</i>
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta. </i>
<i> ...or have to take
orders like a Gamma. </i>
<i> Or to keep track of things
like a Beta. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful.</i>
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>
<i> But I'm glad to be an Alpha. </i>
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>
It's OK
Have some more Soma.
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else. </i>
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>
<i> But I'm glad to be an Alpha. </i>
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta. </i>
<i> ...or have to take
orders like a Gamma. </i>
<i> Or to keep track of things
like a Beta. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful.  </i>
There you are, buddy boy.
I've been looking for you.
Marx, shake a leg:
the Director is waiting.
Have you people seen
these test results?
Anxiety and work disorders for Delta
and Gamma workers, are up for the third quarter running.
Self-esteem and contentment numbers
are down!
It could be because they were
so high before?
We have an idea for the new
conditioning campaign ...
It's a light-hearted approach,
with slogans like,
"They say we only use
10% of our brain ...
... That's way too much. "
Irony, Ingram?
I do not think Deltas
can get it.
Is it possible we focus
too much on the conditioning?
And not enough on the people being conditioned?
'Not sure I follow
Perhaps if we spent less time
telling people how happy they are...
we might figure out what makes them unhappy,
and design conditioning to help them.
Marx, please ...
Don't turn a shoddy performance...
Into an attack to the whole the program.
I didn't mean it as an attack ...
Excuse me Miss ...
How do you feel about being a Delta?
Are you happy?
I'm glad I'm a Delta.
Alphas have to think things through...
Betas and Gammas have
too much to do.
So you see, Mr. Marx, Deltas are happy ...
There are just some isolated failures.
The system works.
62.400 repetitions
make one truth, Bernard.
It's an indisputable fact.
Well, they could work better.
"Ingram?
Do some work on that campaign
and get back to me, please?
You're crazy, you know that?
Bernard, emotional engineering
is what we do ...
How could you be against it?
I'm not against it;
I'm just saying ...
there's room for improvement.
"Soma? Just one gram
and you won't give a damn.
Lenina ...
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
How about coming with me to...
Ash Wednesday Services tomorrow?
Thanks, but I'm afraid
that I already have plans.
Are you going to join me
this weekend?
I'm booked this weekend.
Another time.
Yes, absolutely
another time.
So ...
Who are you going with tonight?
Bernard.
Again?
You're still having Bernard Marx?
It's been a couple of months ...
Have you had sex with anybody else
since then?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me.
I just like Bernard.
I think he's fun, and sexy and...
... Different.
"Different?
You want different?
Try different people.
We're just having a good time.
Then don't keep it all
to yourself.
It's antisocial.
You were so promiscuous in school.
A little Miss Perfect.
Promiscuity,
is a citizen's duty.
It's not just me.
Everyone is starting to talk about
the two of you.
You're right, Fanny.
Soma?
Our path is clear and sunny.
Be thankful that we live now.
Never put off till tomorrow...
The fun you can have today.
<i>Citizens of the world  ...</i>
<i> Happy Ash Wednesday. </i>
<i>Tonight the world
is at peace. </i>
<i>Because we're
organized and united. </i>
<i>So  ...</i>
<i>Let us give thanks </i>
<i> ... and have fun.
Be Happy. </i>
<i> And don't leave anyone out. </i>
<i> Remember: </i>
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else.</i>
Waiting for someone?
Yes, but you'll do...
... for now.
We should join the others.
Why?
Why should it be tonight?
Hey, Fanny!
So we've been seeing a lot of each other,
so what?
Fanny says it's antisocial.
Well, if you ask me, she's long overdue
for violent passion surrogate.
Has it been really
six months?
Yes. And you know
how people talk.
Let them talk.
They have nothing to say.
We can still see each other.
We can still sleep together.
We just... have to have
other people.
All right.
You know if this were before the War,
you know what we'd do, don't you?
We'd get married!
You're still coming with me
to the Reservation next week?
Yes, and we can still, uhm...
Find a couple nutty savages
to fool around.
Hello, Bernard.
Hello.
Hello.
I guess I am free
tonight.
<i>Universal Happiness keeps
the wheels of society steadily turning.</i>
<i> Work is fun. </i>
<i>The harder we work, </i>
<i> the more things we can buy.</i>
<i>New Things!
I hate old things! </i>
<i> I want all new things. </i>
<i>Ending is better than mending. </i>
<i>If it's broken, don't fix it </i>
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>
<i> You work hard,
always doing your best.</i>
<i> So when your workday is done ...</i>
<i> ... you want all life can give. </i>
<i>You want Soma. </i>
<i> Let the world say, Thank you
with Soma. </i>
<i> Work is fun ...</i>
<i>The harder we work, </i>
<i> the more things we can buy.</i>
<i> .. New Things!
I hate old things! </i>
<i> I want all new things. </i>
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>
<i>If it's broken, don't fix it </i>
<i>Ending is better than mending.  </i>

James?
Not another one!
Get back to work.
I said back to work.
What's in your hand?
Are you going back to work or not?
Take care of it!
After the Wars,
When society was reformed...
There were still factions who refused
to be part of the World Government.
These fringe groups now
inhabit the Reservation.
Clinging to the borders of
civilized society.
At the edges of the
Great Wilderness.
While we have advanced ...
these savages retain their
primitive way of life.
Though the borders are
strictly sealed ...
some of us have access.
The poverty and hardship remind us
how lucky we are.
Can we go any lower?
It's stricly discouraged.
'Might lead to contact with the savages.
How can they live like this?
Maybe there's something to it.
Living off the land.
Nothing given to you:
a constant struggle for survival.
Oh, you'd love that, Bernard!
What's happening?
Not sure.
Hang on!.
Hang on,
we're going down!
No... get out of here... not here.
Come on!
I'll contact Border authorities.
'Hope this works.
That is not necessary.
They'll track us with the satellites.
They know where we are.
Hello.
How are you?
We're fine, thank you very much.
Had a little accident!
You probably can see.
We sure could use a little help.
We'll r escue you!
You'll like it!
She does not want you to do that.
Sucker!
Enough.
Leave us alone.
-The Buck, John.
You should thank Mom.
Get back with your Ma's.
...the savages... don't...
He's delirious.
"Sleep that knits up
the ravell’d sleeve of care..."
We should go,
I'll get you to my mother's.
What did you just say?
From "Macbeth:"
Shakespeare.
We'll be all right.
This is my Mother.
How lovely, to have you
at our home.
Real civilized people.
How beautiful you are!
But the way we live ...
You must think it's
so ugly and grim!
No.
What I should offer you?
I put it somewhere...
I think I...
... Somewhere.
Oh, God.
God.
My headaches
It is so rude of me.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry... it's no way
to treat our guests.
Mother ...
Relax.
John.
If I could just have a little drink...
Relax.
I love you.
What happened to you?
My initiation scars.
It must have been painful.
That's the idea.
How did you get all of this?
Linda got'em.
Mostly from my father.
Of course.
I never knew him,
he was one of you.
One of us?
He worked at Border Center.
She was just a girl.
She flirted with him,
he gave her presents.
Told her that she was sexier
than any of the girls in Paris or New York ...
He seduced her.
And took her over to the other side
Showed the Soma bars,
when she got pregnant, he dumped her back here.
It was the last time she ever saw him.
What was his name?
She is not really sure,
She thinks maybe it was "Alpha."
And then he abandonded her
back in this miserable place.
Sorry, I did not mean to...
You're right, it is miserable.
Life isn't worth much here.
Nobody cares about truth or
beauty ...
They live off the scraps of civilization,
they don't even know what it is.
Len.
What?
Shakespeare.
"Since brass, nor stone,
nor earth, nor boundless sea,
"But sad mortality
o'ersways their power,
"How with this rage
shall beauty hold a plea,
...Whose action is no
stronger than a flower?"
Where did you get all these
pre-War books?
Around.
I saved most of them from being
used as kindling.
Why do you read them?
Because they put into words
what you feel but can't say.
It sounds like your ride's here.
To walk down those beautiful avenues!
To see all the shops!
All the lovely people...
Soma.
I want Soma again.
I do not understand what
you are doing.
I have a plan.
Imagine the research possibilities.
Don't worry.
Mond knows we're bringing them back.
You two are married?
No.
You've got a lot to learn about
Civilization, John.
"How many goodly creatures
are there here!
"How beauteous mankind is!
"O brave new world,
... That has such people in't! "
I just wanted ....
to see what would happen ...
... If I stopped.
What did you think would happen?
If a person stops,
the whole line stops.
And then production stops.
What happens if production stops?
If production stops,
then distribution misses their quota
Its economics, you would not understand.
I'm recommending a ten-day
Reconditioning holiday.
When you're done,
You'll feel as good as new, OK?
-Sir?
- What is it now?
It's most irregular, sir.
This is the Conditioning Center.
Where I work.
Ingram.
John Cooper.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
Ingram is an Associate Predestinator.
John is a savage.
What's going on here, Marx?
John, I'd like you to meet the Director
of Hatcheries and Conditioning.
John's from the Reservation.
From the Reservation
and you brought him here. Are you insane?
I don't think so.
He's practically one of us.
That's obscene.
You've crossed the line this time.
Excuse me...
-I hope I'm not interrupting?
Not at all, Controller Mond,
I just wasn't expecting you.
I understand I'm not the only
unexpected visitor today.
Bernard Marx?
Yes, sir.
And this is John?
John Cooper.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Cooper,
you've come a long way.
I'm sure your visit here
will be very interesting for you.
And for us.
I'm having a small gathering.
I'd like you both to be there.
You're invited too, Thomas.
Am I going to live here?.
I hope you like it.
It's nothing special.
Are you kidding me?
Like it? I love it!
What a beautiful view!
Beautiful.
Linda, tell me about John.
I don't think I've ever met
anyone like him before.
He's so ...
... Different.
John is ...
... Is my baby.
My precious boy.
The most beautiful son a mother could have.
The Soma you gave me
it's beginning to wear off
Could I have some more?
Sure.
Thank you.
I think that maybe...
Oh...lovely...

<i> Our lead story tonight: ...</i>
<i> ... there's something new in town... </i>
<i> And he's savagely attractive. </i>
Lenina.
Hi. How are you?
I'm fine.
It's so great to see you.
So tell me ...
Those primitives actually threatened
you of physical violence?
Yes, they did.
And you were prepared
to do physical violence to defend them?
It wasn't needed.
What an exciting story!
My heart is pounding!
Do you feel it?
Quite a change from the Reservation.
You're a friend of the Savage, right?
Yes.
So tell me: what's he like in bed?
-I couldn't tell ...
-Come on!
I don't think I could describe it.
Why did you do that?
Do what?
Playing you slept with John.
What difference does it make?
You haven't, have you?
Not yet.
- Mr. Marx?
- Sir.
Could I have a moment
in private?
Certainly.
Surprised, Mr. Marx?
I find a certain charm...
In these primitive artifacts ...
... a sort of depth that is lacking...
... in our world today.
I've even dabbled in some of the
extinct languages
French, Russian, German ...
As Controller it's my duty to see...
that such eccentric tastes...
don't infect the general population.
Art and philosophy can be ...
so unsettling to the social good.
I'm happy to meet you at last, Marx.
Your name has crossed my desk often
in departmental briefings.
You must have a pretty bad impression
if you go by the DHC's reports
On the contrary.
Between you and me, I find
your Director's disapproval ...
a positive sign
of your potential.
Now ...
You must tell me...
Why did you bring Mr. Cooper here
to Civilization?
As you know, our conditioning results
have been falling lately.
And no one knows why.
I see John as raw material
for emotionary research.
Genetically he is half Alpha.
But in terms
conditioning ...
... he's a blank slate.
Interesting.
But risky.
Don't you think?
Introducing an unknown element
into our society.
is certainly something we labored
very hard to erradicate.
We have to explore the unknown
to make progress, sir.
Very well, Marx.
Continue with your study.
But if you don't mind,
I prefer you to report your findings
directly to me.
I don't mind at all, sir.
It'd be an honor.
Thank you.
You're moving up
in the world, Marx.
Congratulations.
<i> Civilization has certainly had an effect
on savage John Cooper. </i>
<i> But what kind of effect has
he had on us? </i>
<i> We have a special report from our...</i>
In five minutes we'll have a complete
genetic portrait of you.
I can hardly wait for you
to tell me all about myself.
We'll match it to the Alphas who worked
at the Border Center at the time of your conception...
...and identify your father.
Why would you wanna do that?
You don't want to find your father?
I thought family was
so important in your culture.
Bernard, what do you think a father is?
He's the man who contributes sperm
at a life's conception.
It takes a lot more than sperm
to make a man a father...
A father sacrifices for his son:
he shows him who he is...
And it helps him to be a man.
You have absolutely no idea of what
I'm talking about, do you?
No.
But it is interesting.
"Anomaly"
Adrenal secretions:
Normal.
Pulse peaking at 84.
<i>Celebrate yourself</i>
<i>You're unique. </i>
<i> No one is more unique than you. </i>
<i> You're special,
that's what makes us... </i>
<i> It doesn't matter what you look like. </i>
<i> We all look good. </i>
<i>It's what's inside that counts. </i>
<i> If you want it, you can have it. </i>
<i>Reach out, and grab it.</i>
<i>You deserve it,
you've earned it. </i>
<i> If you like it, why not own it? </i>
Hello.
I took Linda shopping.
She's on a Soma holiday.
<i> Take me to the beach... </i>
<i>And tell me...</i>
<i> ... you love me. </i>
I should go.
I don't understand you two.
Why?
You're not married...
You say you're not lovers, but
there is obviously something going on between you.
We are friends.
It's not what I mean.
You're in love with her.
In love? That's quaint!
Don't tell me there's no such thing
as love here, either?
You may say you love your favorite food,
or clothes or sport ...
... But you can't love another person.
That's possessive, selfish.
You really believe that?
I do.
It's unhealthy all that emotion
focused on one person. Don't you think?
No.
What if two women loved the same man,
or if two men loved the same woman?
You might fall in love with someone
who doesn't love you.
That's right!
Lenina should have as many men
as she pleases.
So... you're interested?
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
I'm looking for the Savage.
I don't think this is a good time.
We'll wait.
Did you ever dream when you were stuck in
that horrible Reservation
that you would land here in Civilization?
I do not know ...
I never really thought about it.
I guess I always knew
I had a destiny.
"Destiny"?
By this you mean your unusual
genetic makeup?
No, I don't think genetics
have anything to do with destiny
You make your own
Genetics can't tell you who you are.
Fascinating.
Now tell me
What do you think
of civilized girls?
"Make your own destiny."
"No one else can tell you who you are."
That's the kind of antisocial misinformation
our citizens are forced to listen to thanks to the Savage.
I believe the good Director
exagerates the dangers.
Surely our people are well enough conditioned
to recognize...
... Mr. Cooper's remarks as...
...quaint nonsense.
Why risk disturbance of the social order?
What purpose does it serve?
Everywhere he goes,
he causes a public sensation.
Exactly.
People enjoy sensations, but...
... they also tire of them very quickly, which
I predict will happen with Mr. Cooper.
I asked Bernard Marx to be here today
since he's doing a study of the Savage.
Bernard, do you think
he poses a threat to the society?
If he sees things in a differently
from us...
... that's not dangerous.
That's why he's a valuable
subject for research.
If he's going to stay, he must have
proper conditioning, as all of us have.
Isn't it a little late for that?.
It can be done.
With an accelerated intensive
program it can be done.
That will be valuable research.
You'll destroy everything
that makes him unique.
And ruin a great opportunity
for progress.
For the moment I don't see any harm in
allowing the Savage to remain here at his liberty...
...time will tell whether his presence here
will pose a serious problem.
We'll give people the chance to know,
to touch the real John Cooper...
To feel your heat.  My film will bring
them as close to you ...
...as I am now.
Excuse me.
Ah, John!
I've always supported this man's ideas.
No question is too controversial for us
Right, Bernard?
What do these people want from me?
They've never met
anyone like you before.
You're mysterious.
They don't care who I am.
They just want to be entertained.
I'm just a side-show attraction.
This world isn't what I expected.
What did you expect?
I do not know.
Respect for truth, beauty...
intelligence.
Instead it's just an endless
pursuit of pleasure.
We all have an unalienable
right to happiness.
Yeah, of course.
I would love it if you'd come
and speak to my class...
... about yourself.
They're very excited that
I know you.
All right.
Sorry, but I should go home.
John.
I feel like you avoid
being alone with me.
No...
I don't mean to...
Good!
Good, good, and lovely.
Let's go some place.
I've gotta go.
Give me personnel records for the
Savage Reservation Border Center.
Time range?
24 years ago.
One moment, please.
Stop.
Delete the file!
Files cannot be deleted without...
My security clearance is
directorate level:
Delete it.
One moment please...
Deleting.
<i>Take a holiday from reality. </i>
You're telling me
how to live my life?
I'm just saying that we're civilized:
for us sex is just another activity.
But for John it can mean something else.
He might get the wrong idea.
I'm big girl, Bernard.
I think I understand what was
troubling you with your work...
...It seemed meaningless, unimportant.
How would it be if you could do
something very important for society...
Something that would stop a very bad person
from doing all us terrible harm?
Yes?
Good.
I've designed a special conditioning program
just for you.
<i>Bernard Marx...
he hates you...l </i>
<i> ...he deserves to die... </i>
<i>...kill...criminal...
antisocial... liar...</i>
<i>laughing at you...
...destroy... kill... </i>
<i>Bernard Marx...
Bernard Marx... </i>
What?
What's your first impression?
This place is a factory.
You're turning out
human beings like machines.
Why?
To ensure each citizen
has the proper aptitude.
And remove the danger and
the pain of child bearing.
Danger and pain are a part of life.
If you try to run from them,
you're running from yourself.
What's so great about pain?
It's a body signal that there's something wrong.
Yes, sometimes. But at other times
it teaches us, initiates us ...
How?
The pain of child birth initiates
a woman into motherhood.
When a baby is born, it screams,
sings to the world that its soul is alive.
What about their souls?
"Souls"?
Come on!
Bernard, why did you bring me here?
Why all these notes, why all these tests?
Everything here was supposed to be perfect.
We have our problems too.
But with your help, I can design programs
and that'll give people happier lives.
So you want me to help you figure out
how to make people happier?
Yes.
<i>Kill Bernard Marx...kill... </i>
<i> He's a monster...
a degenerate... </i>
Good luck.
Are you sure?
I don't know how much more clearly I can put it:
There-are-no-matches.
Check again.
The DNA sample I gave you's got to match
one of the Reservation officers at that time.
I have checked.
And it doesn't.
Have you examined every possibility?
Are you saying I'm incompetent?
Would you like to file a complaint?
No, I'm saying we have
to find a match.
There was one small ...
irregularity.
A discrepancy between the file manifest
and the actual number of records I found.
There seems to be a file missing.
That must be it!
Can you try to locate it?
No.
You know what kind of backlog
we have here?
You think we Betas have
nothing better to do..?
Of course not.
What'd we do without you?
Where would we be without the efficiency
you Betas demonstrate every day?
All right.
Check back on Monday.
Two households, both alike in dignity.
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene.
From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny
where civil war makes civil hands unclean...
From forth two fatal loines of these two foes,
a pair of star-crossed lovers, take their life...
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- I do bite my thumb, sir.
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun...
O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name...
O happy dagger!... This is thy sheath;
there rust, and let me die...
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished...
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
So that's Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare,
the greatest writer who ever lived.
What's so great about him?
I didn't understand it.  Was it in
a dead language like French or German?
What's it about?
Romeo and Juliet are...
a boy and girl...
about your age...
... Maybe a little older...
... and they're in love!
But their families are enemies.
In love with what?
With each other.
Haven't you ever wanted something with all your heart
and you just couldn't have it?
Once I really wanted this cute green
polyester jacket with a fake fur collar...
I had to wait for two whole weeks
before I could get one.
That was horrible.
What happens at the end?
Romeo and Juliet commit suicide
rather than be apart.
That's silly.  They can't have each other
so they kill themselves?
It is not about sex,
it's about love.
Don't you know what that is?
Feeling...
passion...
Worth suffering for,
worth dying for?
I'm sorry. I should've prepared them.
The language is interesting, but...
... the stories are very outdated.
The stories aren't outdated.
They're just incapable of understanding them.
You take anything that means anything,
and you tell them that it's nothing.
What would you want me to tell them...
...that people are better off living
in fear and violence?
"The seeming truth which cunning times
put on to entrap the wisest..."
Do you think that people are better off
living like you do in a reservation?
No, no. You people ...
... you want so much,
you want everything, you devour everything...
You're trying to fill some hole.
I don't understand.
Explain it to me.
I can't.
John, I want to understand.
John?
What this world does
to all of you...
I wish I could get through somehow.
What are you doing?
What's wrong?
This is not how you feel about me.
That's not true.
Not true.
I wish.
You like me.
You like me, don't you?
Since first I saw you.
I want to understand ...
to feel...
... the passion.
Lenina.
This is not love.
Linda?
We should've never come here.
Everything here is false.
But you're not even here anymore.
Mother?
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
Catatonic eye reflexes...
Her body's not accustomed
to that much Soma.
Is she gonna live?
It's hard to say.
I've never seen someone in
such a poor physical condition.
You can go.
We'll call you.
I'm not going anywhere.
She is my mother.
So we've all heard.
Still you have no business being here.
This is a hospital.
You don't have to stay
if it makes you uncomfortable.
Let's go.
<i> Sadness is an illusion ...</i>
<i> ...only happiness is real. </i>
John.
John.
Thank you for staying.
You're welcome.
Seeing with your mother ...
... didn't seem so bad.
It was really quite beautiful.
She drives me crazy most of the time.
I can't blame her for drinking.
Or trying to avoid reality.
After I was born ...
People treated her
like a whore.
Men used her.
And you were just a child.
I imagine that...
...you must've felt so helpless.
It's late...
You're tired and upset.
Stay, please.
Do we need more evidence than this
of the Savage's destructive effect?
It's nothing but a fad,
a harmless little cult.
So was Christianity at first.
Mr. Marx, any success in identifying
the Savage's father?
No, Controller, not yet.
Of course not.
Because the Savage made the story up.
For all we know, Mr. Marx colluted in the lie
to advance his own career.
Are you alone?
Yes, come in.
Come in.
What's the matter?
Things aren't going so well.
Sorry.
All this with the DHC, Mond, and John ...
I tried to make things better,
make a mark for myself, but now...
I'm begining to think this world's built on a lie...
Once you see that, it all starts to cumble.
What lie?
That we've eliminated unhappiness,
or that we ever could.
What's going on with you and John?.
I don't know.
He makes me feel ...
...something that I never felt before.
He makes me feel needed.
How do I make you feel?
It is not the same thing.
You don't need anybody, Bernard.
You do fine on your own.
I'm starting to understand why
we've got little flaws.
I don't think we ever did.
<i>Hug me till you drug me, honey...</i>
<i>Kiss me till I'm in a coma...</i>
<i>Hug me, honey...</i>
<i>Snuggly Bunny...</i>
<i> Sex is good, is soma...</i>
<i>Squeeze me, sugar...</i>
What have we got?
I've done everything I can.
Whose ever file was...
It simply no longer exists.
How can that be?
It's a bureaucratic foul up?
Bureaucrats don't foul up.
Systems do.
That file had to be...
...purposely deleted.
Is that possible?
If someone had high enough clearance? Yes.
I've really got to get that record.
Read my lips:
It's gone.
Are you experiencing dissatisfaction?
I already regret saying this, but...
...there might be cross indexes in other departments...
I can check.
That would be helpful.
It's my pleasure.
Please don't...
Please ...
I'm glad I'm a Delta.
Glad I'm a Delta.
Re-engineering?
It's Bernard Marx.
Send a Core
Retrieval Unit quickly.
You've got a crashed Delta here.
I don't know how else I can put it.
These records are classified.
I'm asking you to make an exception.
But that's subversive.
It is but isn't it?
You came back to me!
Why... why are you looking at me...
...like that?
It's upsetting...
I'm sorry...
Turn up your Soma if
you're upset.
Hello. How are you?
I'm fine, thank you very much.
Linda Cooper?.
Yes, this way.
What's wrong?
Are you feeling sick?
You'll make children think
that death is something sad...
...we're trying to teach them.
Her life is over ...
...but it's OK because everyone
else is allive and happy.
We can recycle her organs,
and reclaim the phosphorus.
OK, Come on!
Chocolates, candy!
Is she dead?
She's weird.
Look at her teeth!
She is my mother.
Get out of here!
Stop it.
One dead person can't
matter that much!
You're upsetting
the children.
"... of comfort no man speak:...
...let's talk of graves, and worms
and epitaphs;...
...make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
write sorrow on the bosom of the earth..."
He's silly!
"O, Brave New World
that has such people in it."
What are you
doing to yourself?
It doesn't make you happy:
just enslaves you.
You're not happy!
You're just...
Believe in yourselves!
Find out who you are!
Throw the drug away.
Throw it all away!
- Put that down!
- Throw it away!
Throw it away!
Wake up!
Wake up!
- Look at you've done!
- Wake up!
We're learning more tonight
about the bizarre occurrance
at a Soma Distribution Center
earlier this evening.
John Cooper seems to have...
The Savage is apparently
distraught over the death of his...
the woman who...
Can I say 'mother'?
I don't care what he did it.
He should be made an example of...
We need to show him some compassion.
After all he is only a savage.
This should never
have happened!
I warned you not to let that
savage run loose...
With all due respect, sir.
John is not the problem.
If the Deltas are out of control,
it's our responsibility.
Marx, the Deltas are not out of control.
The problem lies with the Savage.
<i>Agreed!</i>
I demand his immediate
Re-engineering.
Sir, you mustn't allow
this to happen.
"Politics is the art
of the possible," Bernard.
We can't afford
this kind of disorder.
What are you saying,
Controller?
We have to be prepared
to make sacrifices.
Mr. Marx...
I've been looking all over
for you...
You're not going to believe
what I found.
Thank you.
The time has come
for a decision.
Excuse me...
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but before we go any further...
...there's another matter
brought to my attention...
The question everyone is asking:
How could this happen?
Disgusting!
Absolutely sickening.
How a man in his position
could have a baby?
The question isn't
"Why he did it?"
He should be made
an example of...
Clearly I would argue
compassion in this case...
Compassion does not fit
into the equation.
<i> The DHC is...</i>
<i> There's still no indication as to
what will be done with the Savage </i>
I never should've
brought you here.
When the Controller beckons,
we all have to jump!
I mean to Civilization.
That was a mistake.
I'm sorry.
It's nice to know a man born
in a bottle can have a soul.
So...
I understand you don't care much
for Civilization, Mr. Cooper.
No.
It seemed great at first.
All so pretty and clean...all that music...
"Sometimes a thousand twangling
instruments will come about my ears...
...and sometimes voices. "
That's...
"Othello."
Why can't everyone
read Shakespeare?
Anyone can.
But why would the want to?
It wouldn't mean anything
to them.
Our world isn't Shakespeare's,
you know?
Great tragedy...
All great art causes
passion, conflict...
... social instability.
We don't have any
of that anymore.
People are happy.
Happy at what cost?
At the cost of art, religion,
philosophy, love, science...
-Science?
But we're conditioned to believe
that science is everything.
Not true science, Bernard.
Just technology that serves public order.
"Increase consumption."
"Prevent dissatisfaction."
You know?
I was a pretty fair chemist
when I was young.
And I developed an interest
in "pure research."
Well...
... I was nearly
Re-Engineered for it.
I was a lot like you, Bernard,
I had a choice to make:
I loved science.
But I chose to sacrifice that.
To serve the public happiness,
and not my own.
So truth is
another price you pay?
Truth?
There was plenty of talk of truth
and beauty before the Wars...
...while men were devising new ways
to destroy each other.
It was horrible.
But most historical facts
are unpleasant, aren't they?
What about John, sir?
Nothing.
Nothing happens to him.
John is the exception
that proves the rule.
He's the proof that our system is so stable,
we can tolerate a Savage in our midst.
If here were banished, or Re-engineered,
some people might ask...
"Are we missing something?"
No!
In this brave new world we can all
have whatever we like.
And personally...
...I like him.
The World Controller, Mustapha Mond,
announced tonight that a...
...full pardon will be granted
to the Savage.
The Law demands punitive Re-engineering
of our former DHC...
Lenina.
Lenina!
Lenina, I need to talk to you.
I'm leaving!
<i> What is the Savage thinking? </i>
<i> "...I want to be alone." </i>
<i>After Controller Mond gave
social immunity to John Cooper ..</i>
<i> is this his latest snub at
Civilization?</i>
<i>Stay tuned for
more details.</i>
<i> Where exactly is John Cooper?</i>
<i> Everyone wants to know. </i>
<i>Wondering why you haven't seen
the Savage lately?</i>
<i>It's because he hasn't been here.</i>
<i> "We'll show you when the news continue...
"Stay tuned for more details...</i>
<i> There's more when we come back...</i>
<i>Authorities say it is
difficult to imagine anyone...</i>
<i> ...choosing to isolate himself...
but John Cooper has done just that.</i>
<i> You're looking at an abandoned
microwave tower...</i>
<i>There's more to come...</i>
<i>Researchers told us that the Savage
has been confused and irrational...</i>
<i> More of this story when we come back...</i>
<i> It's fun to look at, but
do we really understand?</i>
John, why did you leave?
No! Go away!
<i>Reports say he is suffering
from Soma withdrawal...</i>
<i> Our team reports that
the Savage has never taken Soma...</i>
<i>and this may explain his irrational...</i>
<i> Now that we know where he is,
the question everybody's asking is...</i>
<i> "When is he coming back?"</i>
<i> Authorities say they still
have no idea...</i>
<i> We have a special report...</i>
<i> How he got to this abandoned tower...</i>
<i>Delta workers working outside a plant
claim to have seen a man...</i>
<i>John Cooper, our Savage,
takes a holiday from reality...</i>
<i> ...But without Soma. </i>
<i> We return now to Pamela March
reporting live from the Pre-War tower...</i>
<i>There are a lot of questions
that remain unanswered... </i>
<i>...a series of strange incidents
sorrounding the Savage...</i>
<i> Conditioning experts don't know
the effects this could have on our society...</i>
<i>...have told us the Savage has been
confused and irrational...</i>
He's over there!
He's down there!
<i> John, wait!</i>
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
I have nothing to give you.
What about you, John?
What do you want?
I want... pain.
I want freedom.
I want goodness.
I want evil.
I want sin.
I want...
love!
John!
"I went into the woods...
...because I wanted to breathe deep
and suck all the marrow out of life...
...to put to rout all that
was not life...
...and not when it came time to die,
to discover that I had not lived."
"To be awake is to be alive."
<i>We've got the whole
thing on tape...</i>
<i>I need you.</i>
<i> I want you.</i>
<i> I want you.</i>
<i> I love you. </i>
Yes?
All right!
Mond wants me.
I have to go.
The confirmation hearing for
Bernard Marx as DHC continues...
Please tell me if it's satisfactory.
A bit of a change?
Adjusting to the lifestyle
of Director?
I suppose I can make
the sacrifice.
Are you still having Lenina Crowne
from Educational Conditioning?
I hardly have time for anyone, sir.
I wonder if we can discuss some of my
ideas about reforming the Conditioning Dept.
That might be rushing
things a bit.
First we have to ensure
your appointment clears the Directory...
And that might take a little massaging.
Once that's done...
Then...
I suggest creating a committee that
can report on the advisability of reform...
That can take a long time.
It's best to err on the side
of caution, Bernard.
Yes.
I'm very pleased with
your success, Bernard.
I meant it when I said
I was like you when I was young.
We can almost be from
the same gland extract.
Well.
Have some fun,
be happy.
Don't deny yourself anything.
The ancient Greeks...
...worshipped men of sacrifice and action,
whom they called heroes.
As Civilization progressed,
...the world of heroes became...
...more and more...
irrelevant.
Now we know that
heroism is really...
... Antisocial behaviour.
But necessary in the old...
... And imperfect world.
Because...
Heroes...change things.
We're not supposed to want
anything to change.
Heroes mean that one person
can make a difference.
- Miss Crowne?
-Yes?
I don't see that in the book.
It's not in the book.
Are you saying that the
textbook is wrong?
Well ...
What do you think?
How would I know?
I don't know more than this textbook.
Neither do you. You're just one person.
Who do you think you are?
Nobody.
Yes?
I'm Lenina Crowne,
Bernard wanted to see me.
Yes, the DHC elect
will see you.
How are you?
What do you want?
To see you. Catch up.
Find out how you've been.
All right, we'll get
straight to it...
I have some negative feedback
from the students...
I'm on your side.
Together we can avoid this
negatively impacting you.
Bernard...
It's not important.
I'm afraid it is, Len.
I know, you wanted to make a difference,
but what difference can you make?
I'm in a position to help you...
You can't help me,
it's too late.
No, it's not too late.
I'm pregnant.
Really?
-Yes.
Pregnant?
The night that John died I didn't
use my birth control.
I'm carrying your baby.
My baby?
My baby?
First we'll say
it was an accident.
That you thought you'd taken your birth control...
-No, Bernard...
-I wanna have this child...
- It's impossible, it's illegal...
- I know.
-No.
Then they're going to
have to kill me.
Perhaps they will and find something
equally suitable for me?
They'll never put up with another
DHC as a father...
I didn't mean to hurt you.
- But you're certain on doing this?
-Yes.
Yes, I am.
I'll get you out.
It is the only way
you can have the child.
-Thank you.
-Understand you'll be on your own...
You can never come back.
I understand.
And you still get to be DHC.
I am so sorry.
I'm sorry too.
<i>Banishment meant going
beyond the Badlands</i>
<i> To a place where people were too self-consciously
individual to fit into Civilization</i>
Why wasn't this man made
head of the Department before?
We think our conditions are
improving tremendously.
I'll drink to that.
I sort of miss the old man,
you know.
"Let me impregnate you."
"I want to be a father!"
"I want to be a father!"
Great.
Life was very different
before the Wars.
It wasn't until the
world was unified...
...under a rational, scientifically enlightened
government that real progress could occur.
And now we live in luxury,
safety, and harmony.
Could there be a better time
to be alive?
<i> Celebrate yourself.
You are unique. </i>
<i> No one is more unique than you. </i>
<i>It doesn't matter
what you look like.</i>
<i> We all look good.</i>
<i>It's what's inside
that counts.</i>
<i> But looking good is important. </i>
<i> The better you look,
the better you feel. </i>
<i>It's important to feel good. </i>
<i> If we look good,
we are good.</i>
<i> If you want it,
you can have it.</i>
<i> Reach out and grab it!</i>
<i>You deserve it.
Celebrate yourself.</i>
<i> Let the world say, "Thank you"
with Soma.</i>
- Are the Directors assembled?.
- Yes, sir.
Where's Marx?
What is this?
"Sincere apologies.
Regret I cannot attend."
Where the hell is he?
Sir, apparently,
he authorized a trip.
He gave Security the impression
that you were aware.
<i> There is a place,
and a purpose for everyone. </i>
<i> So everyone is happy. </i>
<i>And we all have fun:
Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta...</i>
<i>Everyone belongs to everyone else.</i>
<i>We have to respect Deltas,
Gammas and Betas. </i>
<i> Everyone is useful. </i>
<i>I am so glad I'm an Alpha...</i>
<i> I'd hate to be a dull as a
Delta...</i>
