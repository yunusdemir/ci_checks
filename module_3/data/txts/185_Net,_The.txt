Well, thanks for the information.
I appreciate it.
There's no chance a mistake
could've been made?
A misreading? Human error?
It happens.
Oh.
Well, that sort of rules that
out, then, doesn't it?
So this really is a reality.
Mr. Secretary, your car.
Ah, yes. Thank you.
Eddie, let's take the parkway.
Okay, buddy. Final offer.
Non-negotiable.
For every buckle-down hour
you give Algebra Two,
you get two of quality time with
Nintendo and Sega.
Deal?
Heh. Just whatever you do,
don't tell your mother.
Good. Now, put her back on.
Okay, hon. Number one son
back on the straight and narrow.
Me? Fine. Just needed a little
field trip to clear the head.
Bit of a nightmare day.
I'll see you in a bit.
You bet.
I love you, Liz.
This is a very dynamic game,
Mr. Depina.
<i>You can be honest, Angela.</i>
<i>This game is as bloody as it gets.</i>
<i>But believe me,
the kids will eat this up.</i>
<i>But first you gotta tell me
what keeps crashing the damn thing.</i>
Well, you have been virused, Mr. Depina,
and a not so very nice one.
<i>You are the best. I knew I could
count on you. So, what should we do?</i>
Well, don't think about hitting the escape
key on any of your systems for a while.
One keystroke will wipe out
your whole system.
<i>I don't know how these things happen. I just
ordered that security program last week.</i>
<i>What's it called?
Gatekeeper?</i>
Well, that's what they all say.
Did you install it?
<i>Absolutely.
The minute we got it.</i>
<i>I think.</i>
Not to worry. Everything's under
control. It's gonna be okay.
<i>You're the best, Angela.</i>
<i>Now, do you think we'll be able to get
this back in stores by week's end?</i>
Absolutely.
Everything but the virus.
A friend of mine collects them.
I don't know,
some people save string.
<i>You are a genius, Angela.
I can't thank you enough.</i>
Yeah, well, you might think differently
once you get my bill from Cathedral.
<i>Look, whatever it is,
it's worth it.</i>
<i>Angela, I'd love to show
you my appreciation,</i>
<i>take you out to dinner tonight,
some drinks. Get you out of the house.</i>
Oh, I'm very flattered
and appreciative, but I...
<i>You gotta eat.</i>
Uh, it's... Unfortunately,
I already have dinner plans, so...
<i>How about tomorrow?
The next day?</i>
Um, these plans are kind of
a standing arrangement,
but I appreciate it.
Thank you.
<i>Look, you're still the best, Angela.</i>
I'll speak to you soon.
<i>Thanks. Bye now.</i>
Bye-bye.
Hello.
Large. Garlic?
Garlic.
Thank you.
<i>No one leaves the house anymore.</i>
<i>No one has sex.</i>
<i>The Net is ultimate condom.</i>
Come on.
Talk like that, Iceman, could lead to
the eventual extinction of our species.
<i>My sympathies exactly, Angel.</i>
<i>Let's have a date and procreate.</i>
Not me. In two days,
I'm off on vacation.
Just me, the beach and a book.
<i>I'm there, babe.
Look no further.</i>
Sorry. Not my type.
<i>I'm crushed. So, what do you
want in a man?</i>
Hmm.
Butch. Beautiful.
Brilliant.
Captain America
meets Albert Schweitzer.
Spends all day dashing into fray
while making world
safe for democracy.
At night, playing Bach Cantatas
while curing cancer.
<i>Settle for a guy who
puts the seat down?</i>
<i>Listen, Angel, you're dreaming.</i>
<i>You're one of us.</i>
<i>We accept you.
We accept her.</i>
<i>- You're one of us.
- One of us.</i>
Yeah, I know.
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful. I love Chopin.
You know this piece?
Well, I should.
You taught it to me.
Brought you something.
Just don't let the nurses
eat it all this time.
My favorite.
How did you know?
Mm.
Do you wanna...
We could play together. Do you...
Now, I'm going on vacation for
about a week to the Yucat√°n.
If for any reason you need
to get in touch with me,
I don't know if they have phones there,
but you can talk to one
of the nurses and I'll...
You must be one of my students.
No, Mom, my name's Angela.
Can you bring me some candy
when you come again?
My favorites are those...
Almond Rosa.
Yeah, I know what
your favorites are.
Angela Bennett!
- Who is it?
- FedEx!
<i>Thank you for using</i>
Coming.
<i>our reservation service.
Have a pleasant flight.</i>
Hi.
Hi.
Line five, please.
Oh, I have another one going out.
Okay. Here you go, ma'am.
Thanks.
And here's your virus, Dale.
Can I use your pen?
Yeah, sure.
This is a nice place.
Thanks.
Have a nice day, ma'am. Bye-bye.
You too.
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>
Thank you.
<i>The hottest band
on the Internet!</i>
Cathedral Software.
Dale Hessman, please.
<i>Please hold.</i>
Hello.
<i>Hi, it's Angela.</i>
Angela?
FedEx Ship Software had you
signing for that disk three minutes ago.
What took you so long?
Well, I was having way too much
fun with this Mozart's Ghost.
By the way, I sent you a whopper
of a virus for your hall of fame.
Just be a little careful with
the escape button.
Look, here's the problem.
Pop yourself into concert information.
All right.
Houston Utilities. Um, Dale,
I think you took a wrong turn here.
Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?
See anything unusual?
Mmm, no. Looks like a normal
web page to me, except for that little...
What is that? A little icon at
the bottom of the screen?
Click on it, and then press
control-shift.
My God.
<i>So, what do you make of all this?</i>
Simple.
It's a programing glitch.
Just a futzed keystroke that sends you
to the wrong Internet address, that's all.
Last night it sent me to Amtrak's central
mainframe and then the Mayo Clinic.
Neither of them
are on the same subnet.
<i>Angela, I've accessed a system
I shouldn't have.</i>
<i>If someone gets ahold of that disk,
they'd have an awful lot of power.</i>
So why don't you just crawl in there,
find the program error and delete it?
Not quite ready to do that yet.
Look, what's your day like tomorrow?
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I'm going on my first vacation
in six years.
Just made my reservation and
confirmed it. There are no refunds.
<i>What time is your flight?</i>
Twelve. But I have to pack.
I'm gonna be a complete madwoman,
so why don't you just
wait till I get back?
I don't think so.
Come on, why don't you just tell
me what this is about?
<i>Look, I'd rather
not on the phone.</i>
I can fly down tonight in my
Cessna, be there by breakfast.
We'd have five hours. Angela,
<i>you know this shit
better than anyone.</i>
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.
I'll see you at 7.
Great. Great. So they
finally get to meet.
I'll be the, uh... The tall guy.
I'm gonna be the one with "spineless
simp" tattooed to her forehead.
Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>
See you tomorrow.
Why do I do this?
Burbank tower,
Cessna 739 Mike Bravo.
Intercepting approach course
ILS, runway eight.
<i>Three-nine
Mike Bravo, we've lost radar contact.</i>
<i>Say your position and altitude.</i>
Just passing the middle
marker at 1300 feet.
<i>Three-nine Mike Bravo,
that's a negative.</i>
<i>Verify your position
and check your instruments.</i>
All normal. You must
be able to see my lights.
<i>That's a negative. Execute
a missed approach immediately.</i>
<i>Contact approach control
on 124.5.</i>
Okay, Burbank,
but still, everything looks ok...
Shit! God!
Cathedral Software.
Hi. Russ Melbourne, please.
Yes, one moment, please.
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>
Russ Melbourne here.
<i>Hi, it's Angela.</i>
Angela. I thought
you'd be long gone.
No, I was actually getting ready
to leave. That's why I'm calling.
Good. I'm glad you're still going, but
when you get back, we need to talk.
<i>We're really desperately short
of your genius up here.</i>
Oh, please. I am far from
being a genius, Russ,
especially with a room full
of people looking over my shoulder.
We've talked about this before.
Listen, that's not the reason I called.
Just think about it, will you?
The honchos up here aren't going
to let me pick up someone new
to replace Dale on such
short notice,
<i>not with all the security
breaches we've had in the past.</i>
Replace Dale?
Okay.
What? You're kidding, right?
<i>Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd heard.</i>
What? What happened?
Angela, Dale's dead. His plane
crashed last night outside L.A.
He... I just talked to him yesterday.
He was... He was coming to see me.
Kind of puts things in
perspective, doesn't it?
<i>Well, let's talk when
you get back, huh?</i>
<i>And, heh, try to have
a good vacation.</i>
Okay.
I'll talk to you soon, Russ.
Plenty of time, sis.
Plenty of time.
Ain't nothing coming in
or going out for the last hour.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.</i>
<i>We are sorry to announce
there is a computer malfunction</i>
<i>and all flights have been canceled...</i>
The whole airport is down.
<i>As soon as we get further
information, we will advise you.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
We will let you all know.
I am sorry...
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We are doing the best we can.
Yeah. Okay.
<i>...political circles that a blood test</i>
<i>taken last week at
Bethesda Naval Hospital</i>
<i>did in fact reveal that Under Secretary
of Defense Mike Bergstrom</i>
<i>was infected with
the AIDS virus.</i>
<i>Bergstrom, well known for his...
You okay?</i>
Oh, yeah. It's just, you know,
all these people. It's a little...
No, I meant, are you okay with
your soda? Would you like a refill?
No, I'm fine.
I've had three already.
<i>The computer malfunction
has been repaired.</i>
One more and I'll probably be
able to fly myself to Mexico.
Looks like you won't have to.
Enjoy your flight.
<i>Mozart's ghost!</i>
Waiter.
I'd like a Gibson, please.
It's a martini with an onion
instead of an olive.
Is that okay?
Thanks.
Excuse me. Could I
have one too, please?
I'll take mine up at the bar.
Didn't think anybody else
drank those anymore.
Well, I guess I'm not as unfashionable
as I once thought I was.
Is that business or pleasure?
Is there a difference?
Not a great deal if you're a hacker.
That's a nice piece of hardware.
I assume you're in the business?
Isn't everybody?
Nope.
God, we're pathetic, aren't we?
Excuse me?
Well, we're here.
We're sitting on the most
perfect beach in the world,
and all we can think about
is where...
Where can I hook up my modem?
Yeah, exactly.
Um...
I'm Jack Devlin.
Ange... Angela Bennett.
Angela?
Mm-hm.
Hi.
Uh-oh.
Ha, ha.
My most embarrassing secret.
<i>You know Breakfast at Tiffany's?</i>
Very well. it's... It's my favorite film.
Right.
I pretty much wore out my
membership renting it, so...
You know what I'm talking about, then.
Yes, very much so.
When I was about 13,
I had this sort of...
identity crisis.
I used to think
I was one of the characters.
You thought you were
Audrey Hepburn?
No, I used to think I was the cat.
The cat?
Mm-hm.
And I'd... I'd sit there, and I'd
Ha, ha.
Play out the last
scene of the movie.
I'd just play it over
and over again.
You know the last scene?
Yes, I know the last scene.
Out in the pouring rain,
out in the alleyway,
and I'm soaked to the
bone and I'm scared.
And I'm...
abandoned.
I'm alone.
That's it.
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?
Come on.
It's your last night.
You know what?
I would...
I would actually really love to.
Great.
It's a company perk.
God, this is a company perk?
Yeah.
Some perk.
I think I got a calendar
one year from Cathedral.
Where are you from?
Colorado? Yes, it has to be.
Um, eastern... Maybe it's the
southeastern part of the state.
The teeming metropolis
of La Junta, population 50.
La Junta?
Ha-ha-ha. That's pretty good.
Is my accent that strong
after all these years?
No, it's just a trick I do.
Oh.
Why "after all these years"?
How long you been gone?
Oh, boy.
It seems like a lifetime.
Let's see. I was, uh...
I was 15, going on 10,
and we moved from La Junta
to San Jose,
Tulsa, um...
So your father got transferred a lot.
No, not really. No. He, um...
I don't know. You know, he
just transferred out one day.
What?
What are you looking at?
You.
Me?
Computers are your life,
aren't they?
Yes. Perfect hiding place.
Thanks.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.
Picture of you.
No, I have one or two other
interests, I'll have you know.
Oh, yes? Such as? What's your
specialty in computers?
Oh, um, anything, pretty much. Beta
testing, mostly, but pretty much anything.
That's way over my head,
I'm afraid.
No, no. I just... You just go
into people's systems,
you find their faults and
you fix it, that's all.
What happens if they
don't have any faults?
Don't believe I've met one yet.
You must be a bit cold.
Not really. Well, yeah.
A little bit. Heh.
Here.
What?
Well, it goes around here.
What are you doing?
Ha-ha-ha.
Better?
Want one?
Oh, God, I used to smoke those.
But you quit, right?
Mm-hm.
Well, I refuse to.
I reckon you gotta try a few things
in life without a safety net or
how else
you gonna know you're alive?
Well, I...
I take my share of risks.
Uh-huh.
Um, I don't always floss.
I rip the tags off my pillows
when they're new.
My kind of woman.
Yeah, well...
Pretty adventurous.
I don't know.
I mean, what did you have in mind?
Dare you risk it?
Oh, shit! My purse!
Fuck.
No, no! Don't!
- It's not worth getting killed over!
- Come back!
- You! Stop!
- Jack, don't! Come back here!
It's not here.
It's not in hotel.
I look everywhere.
Shit!
So I come here, I do like you say.
Whoosh, like magician.
Oh, yeah. You're the midget Houdini.
Jack?
Jack!
God, I had
everything in that bag.
I had my passport.
I had my credit cards. I had...
- Ow!
- Sorry. Sorry.
Thanks for doing this.
Well, you're the one
bleeding to death.
I am the one crying about
my MasterCard.
I apologize for having been a jerk.
What do you mean?
I'm the jerk.
Only trying to impress you.
Well, for future reference,
you should know that the living
tend to interest me just
a little more than the dead do.
Yeah?
Yeah.
I suppose that's quite healthy.
Mm.
Look, I suppose we ought to try
and call up the Canc√∫n police
on the ship-to-shore.
Okay.
It's not working.
We'll have to head further out.
Well, you can head out to Morocco for
all I care. It's beautiful out here.
How we doing?
Still no dice.
I'm just going down below.
I won't be a minute.
Maybe we didn't go out far enough.
No, this should do it.
Tonight's been so out
of control, huh?
Yeah.
I hope you don't take
this the wrong way,
but this isn't exactly my style.
I thought you liked taking risks.
Well,
yes, but I mean...
You know what I mean.
What?
You know, first date.
Yeah.
Sex. One-night stand. That sort of thing.
Oh, sex.
Yes, that sort of thing.
Ha-ha-ha.
You've always been
a relationship kind of girl.
Absolutely.
Both times.
So when was the last time?
Um, 1933?
Oh, I see.
And who was he?
Your college boyfriend?
Yeah, I bet he was the...
He was the captain
of the drinking team.
Wasn't ready for a relationship.
Ah, wish I had been that lucky.
No, it was, uh...
it was my shrink, actually.
You know the story.
I thought I was lonely
and he forgot he was married.
That's okay.
It didn't last very long.
Then my mom developed Alzheimer's
around then, so it was really...
You know what?
I'll shut up right now.
I'm just gonna be quiet.
That's okay.
No, actually, I... It's me who
doesn't want to hear it. Ahem.
Sorry, I'm just...
I'm rambling a little bit,
I think because
I'm a little nervous.
You want a drink?
Well, yes. That'd be greatly
appreciated. Thank you.
So, what's this for?
It's, uh...
It's for shark fishing.
Shark fishing?
With a silencer?
Yeah.
You certainly seem
to know your ordnance.
Colorado.
You grow up with guns.
Yeah.
So...
Who are you, Jack?
Heh.
Who am I? Who am I?
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm Captain goddamn America meets
Albert Schweitzer, that's who I am.
Isn't that what you always wanted?
It is. I remember.
It was, um... Butch,
beautiful, brilliant.
Spends all day dashing
into the fray, fists flying.
No, sorry, I don't know any
organ cantatas. Was that it?
Yeah, and if you'll excuse me,
it's time to make
the world safe for democracy.
Where's the clip?
Give me that!
Bitch.
Okay. Help, somebody.
Somebody, I need help.
Somebody? Hello, somebody?
Please, somebody, I need help.
Somebody? Please?
Okay. All right, um, keys.
Keys. Okay, keys.
Okay.
Keys.
Okay, um...
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Shh, shh.
What? No. How did...
How did I get here?
How'd I get here?
A fisherman found you.
He brought you here.
You were very lucky they came by.
How long have I been here?
Three days.
Try not to talk too much, hm?
Oh, we found a man's wallet filled
with pesos and a lot of U.S. dollars.
We tried to contact him.
No. No. No, he...
No, no, no. There was
no luck finding this man.
There was a disk.
A green square. A plastic disk.
Ah, yes, yes.
The disk was ruined by the sun.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
You relax now, hm?
Get well.
No, I... I'm...
In a few days...
I need...
Look at you now.
No. I need my clothes.
You haven't got the strength. Please.
How much do I owe you?
Please. You have to relax now.
No.
You have to rest. You need a few days.
I need my clothes.
I have to go.
I just need my clothes.
<i>In national news, we go
to WNN correspondent Daniel Schorr.</i>
Hi, I need...
<i>Wall Street panicked when
stock prices appeared to tumble</i>
<i>at a rate reminiscent of
the Black Tuesday crash.</i>
<i>Officials suspended trading when it became
clear that the losses were fictitious</i>
<i>and caused by computer pranksters
when obscene messages appeared...</i>
I need my room key
for 2806, please.
What is the name?
Angela Bennett.
<i>Wall Street expects
to open tomorrow</i>
<i>with its computers protected
by Gregg Microsystems'</i>
<i>latest security program,
aptly nicknamed the Gatekeeper.</i>
<i>What about
that prank downtown?</i>
<i>Pranks? Short-sheeting
someone's bed is a prank.</i>
<i>These praetorians could have done
serious damage to our economy,</i>
<i>just as the actions
recently at LAX.</i>
No, I'm sorry. Angela Bennett
checked out last Saturday night.
No. Sorry, you don't understand.
I'm Angela Bennett.
I'm standing right here.
I didn't check out.
No. I'm sorry,
it's not on the computer.
Let me check one more thing.
<i>On a lighter note,
a drug raid in Detroit...</i>
No Angela Bennett. She checked
out last Saturday night.
No.
I didn't check out.
I would know if I checked out.
I didn't check out.
According to the computer,
you checked out.
There's nothing
I can do for you, okay? I'm sorry.
Excuse me, sir?
Step in, sir, please.
That room is fine.
We'll take it.
That's for you.
Okay. This one.
Excuse me, ma'am.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
<i>Please dial
your card number again now.</i>
<i>The card number you have
just dialed is not valid.</i>
Miss Marx?
<i>Please dial your card
number again now.</i>
Ruth Marx?
Excuse me, are you Ruth Marx?
No.
You're not the woman who's
here about a temporary visa?
No, I am here about a visa, but...
Is your social security
number 915-30-1717?
You live at 407 Finley Avenue, Venice?
Yeah.
Well, then according
to the computers
of the California Department of
Motor Vehicles, you're Ruth Marx.
So, if that's who you are,
you need to sign there
and we'll issue your visa.
But I'm... I'm not, um...
You're not what?
Um... I'm not, uh,
clear about something.
Without this, I can't get back into
the United States, is that correct?
That's correct.
So...
all I would have to do is
just sign Ruth Marx and...
Right. There.
Okay, okay.
Think, think, think.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Hey, where you running?
Don't run.
Take your time. Relax.
My name is Stan Whiteman,
Whiteman Realty.
Come on in, let me show you around.
You'll like it.
Oh, I definitely
saw her move out.
Okay, when was this?
Three days ago.
Moving van, moving men, furniture.
No, no. I've been in Mexico
for over a week now.
How could I be in L.A. selling
my house at the same time?
It wasn't your house to sell!
It's not her! I'm telling you,
it's not Angela Bennett!
Please, sir, calm down.
I am Angela Bennett!
Please.
The real Angela Bennett
had the deed and the
mortgage papers. Come on!
I got 20,000 in the computers over here.
I checked every record. It's not her!
Look, ma'am,
it would help everything
if you could produce
some form of identification.
You know what?
I agree with you,
I agree with you. But as I have
told you 1,000 times already today,
that I had everything
stolen in Cozumel.
Please. Ask her how she got across
the border without a passport.
- I had a temporary issued.
- Do they do that?
I don't think they do that.
Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.
Here. Here it is. This is it. It's
just that it's under a different name.
Why's that?
Because they think I'm not me.
Is this your signature?
Well, no. It's my handwriting,
but I just signed the different
name that they gave me.
It's a federal
offense to forge a visa.
Oh, really? It is? And what is
it to steal an entire house?
Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?
I'll be right back.
You know what? It's not
gonna make any difference,
because what they've done is they've screwed
with my information and fingerprints.
<i>Who's they?</i>
<i>I have no idea.</i>
<i>Where do you work?
Do you work around here?</i>
<i>Well, yeah, I work in my house,
but, I mean, my office is in San Francisco,</i>
<i>but I've never been there.
But I work out of my house.</i>
You don't know one person in a town
you've lived in for four years
who can vouch you're Angela Bennett?
Not a mother, a father?
<i>My mother is not well.
My father is... No. No. I...</i>
<i>There's, uh... There's my
therapist Alan Champion.</i>
<i>Your therapist?</i>
<i>My ex-therapist, all right?</i>
Yeah, we've got a Ruth
Marx trying to run a scam at a house.
She's wanted for prostitution and
narcotics. We're gonna bring her in.
Um, would you excuse me?
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm, uh, just gonna use...
Mrs. Raines,
is she or isn't she?
She kept to herself,
didn't talk to anybody.
Where's the girl?
She's...
Where's my phone?
Anybody seen my phone?
Excuse me, sir. Did you see a
young woman running out of here?
No, sir. I haven't seen anyone.
Thanks.
Yeah?
<i>What the hell
happened, Devlin?</i>
<i>Don't worry.
We'll get hold of the disk</i>
<i>and we'll find whoever
she's been speaking to.</i>
<i>Don't forget, she's out here on her own.
She's feeling pretty vulnerable.</i>
<i>We don't want another
Cozumel, Mr. Devlin.</i>
<i>She's your responsibility.
Deal with it.</i>
<i>Look, I said I 'd take
care of her, all right?</i>
<i>Cathedral Software.</i>
Russ Melbourne.
<i>Mr. Melbourne is no longer
with the company.</i>
What do you mean?
<i>May I connect you to
someone who could help?</i>
I've never... I've never dealt with anybody
in Operations. I don't know anybody else.
<i>Who may I connect you with?</i>
Um...
Head of Security Systems. Look, just
tell them that it's Angela Bennett.
<i>Thank you. I'll put you
through to Miss Bennett.</i>
What? No.
I am Angela Bennett.
Hello?
Hello, this is Angela Bennett.
Who is this?
<i>This is Angela Bennett. Hello?</i>
<i>This is someone that can help you.
Give us the disk, Angela.</i>
You have the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Angela. We're not offering
an option here.
Just give us the disk, and
we'll give you your life back.
I don't understand.
I don't have your disk.
I don't know what you mean.
<i>Give us the disk, Angela.</i>
What is it?
- What's the number?
555-7605.
Did you get the address?
<i>It's 3100 California.</i>
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Alan
Champion. I can't come to the phone now</i>
Oh, please be home.
<i>So at the beep, please leave your name,</i>
<i>your number, la dee da.
You know the drill.</i>
- Are you screening? Please be screening.
<i>- Hello. Hello. I'm home.</i>
Hi. It's me.
I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.
Shit.
<i>I'm not exactly sure
what else you want me to do.</i>
Look, hold on, hold on.
This is a cell phone, right?
<i>Yeah. So, I mean, we can't put
a normal trace on it.</i>
No, listen.
There's no problem. No, no, no.
Just get the number.
<i>Right.</i>
But don't dial it.
Just send out a signal.
<i>Send it from the base here?</i>
Yeah.
Then find me two repeater
cells that can pick it up.
Give me the bisect and it'll find
it within a few hundred yards.
<i>Okay.</i>
Go.
Alan? Angie?
Go, go, go.
Nice to see you too.
I'm sorry. Just go.
Well, come on, I'm not a cab.
Say hi.
Hi. Can we go now?
Yeah. Now we can go.
Listen, you still have that
laptop that I gave you?
Uh-huh. I'm wearing it.
I'm serious. Do you have it?
Yes, I have it.
Okay, we need to go get it, and then I
need for you to take me to a hotel room.
Now, that, that's doable.
Alan, just go.
Just go. Go, go, go.
I swear to God. I asked for a
quarter, she gave me a telephone.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling everybody.
Clever girl.
Voila'. Ouch. Ha, ha.
Alan, you don't have to...
To stay if you don't want to.
I'm sure that, um...
God, what's her name? Sorry.
Amy. Don't worry.
It's over with Amy.
I'm sorry.
Ha, ha.
Don't be, dearie.
We're not. This is...
This is bizarre.
I haven't seen you in so long.
What are we even doing here?
Um, I just figured
you would be safe.
Oh, great.
So I've gone from being
a self-centered asshole to safe.
Thank you very much.
No, I just figured that they
couldn't trace me to you
and that your... Your patient
records are confidential, right?
My patient records.
Yeah, I knew I had
my subtle charms.
It's just, you're the only person
I have to turn to right now, so...
And you know what, Angie?
I am gonna take that
as a big, big compliment.
Guess what time it is.
Gibsons.
Almost. We have no onions,
so we'll have to use these.
Seldane, the antihistamine
of champions.
Heh. I could always
make you laugh, couldn't I?
You know what? I'm gonna pass.
No drink?
No drink.
Hmm.
All right.
I come bearing gifts.
Some of Amy's clothes for
you here. Try these on.
This is such a nightmare.
It's like I'm not even me anymore.
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.
Come on. Look at me.
You're freaking me.
You gotta take a breath,
take a pause.
Okay, if you're not you,
tell me who you think you are.
Christ, you're not even listening to me.
Oh, I am listening.
But come on,
somebody stole your purse.
I didn't expect you to believe me.
Oh, come on. I do believe...
Yeah, that's not true.
You know what I believe?
I believe you're
a very frightened woman.
I think in general, you're
disconnected from the human race.
I think you're way out
there on your own.
You mix in your father leaving...
Oh, no. No.
My father has nothing to do with
the fact that my car's missing,
has nothing to do with the fact
that my house is empty,
that the Los Angeles Police
Department is chasing after me
and that somebody out there
wants to kill me. No.
Now, I believe something happened,
but that just doesn't make sense.
Oh.
I don't want to be simplistic here, but
I think you're just reaching out.
You know what? You're absolutely
right. I am reaching out.
I'm reaching out to
anybody who knows me,
anybody who will listen
to me and believe me,
be my friend and somebody to trust...
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, Angie.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes it's easier for me to
play doctor than it is to listen.
I just don't... I don't understand.
Why me? Why me?
I am nobody. I am nothing.
But they knew everything about me.
They knew what I ate, what I drank.
They knew what movies that I watched.
They knew what...
Where I was from.
They knew what cigarettes
I used to smoke.
And everything they did, they must have
watched on the Internet. I don't know.
Watched my credit cards?
Our whole lives are on the computer,
and they knew that I
could be vanished.
They knew that nobody
would care It's gonna be okay.
And it wouldn't matter.
It's gonna be okay.
It's going to be okay.
What can I do?
I need for you to take my morn
and just put her anywhere.
I don't care where, just put her
under a different name,
because I don't know what
these people are gonna do.
You can do that because you're a doctor?
Yeah, sure.
I can put your mom
in the county sanitarium,
say I want her there for
observation. How's that?
That would mean a lot to me, because
she's all I got left right now.
All that you have left?
Christ, Angie, they've really
gotten into your head with this.
Well, come on, put yourself in my shoes.
I don't hear from you for a long time.
I get a phone call,
this convoluted story. Come on.
I'm not buying the whole package,
but I'll tell you what I can do.
I have a friend downtown in the federal
building. His name's Ben Phillips.
He's an FBI agent. Why don't I...
No, no, no!
I've been running from the police ever
since I got back in this country.
That's the last thing I need.
Well, that's great, Angela.
Why don't you just live the rest of your
life in this hotel room, how's that?
Well, do you trust him?
Yeah. I used to hold his head
over the toilet at frat parties.
Come on. I'm serious.
Do you trust him?
Yeah, I trust Ben. I do.
Okay.
Now let's formulate our plan.
I'm gonna go back to my place.
I'll figure out the best way to
transfer your mom to the sanitarium.
Then I'll call Ben. If I get any
information, I'll get back to you.
Okay.
Well, don't be so down.
Come here.
It's gonna be okay.
I'm on watch now.
You know, this would've never
happened if you had stayed with me.
Hey, Alan?
Thank you for everything.
You're welcome.
You stay put, kiddo.
Okay.
Mm, <i>merci.</i>
Now prompt me, please.
Okay. You carried this around,
Devlin, because it was important.
Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Password.
Okay, password.
We're gonna try you.
No. okay. Well, you look familiar.
Let's try you again.
No, come on.
Okay. Five-three-four... Now.
Okay.
Bergstrom?
What?
Oh, my God.
<i>- Yeah.
- Someone's on.</i>
Think it's our girl?
<i>Whoever it is, is covering
their tracks big time.</i>
<i>A dozen hops so far. A pop in Switzerland,
a UNIX box in the University of Montana,</i>
<i>five different routers
at Berkeley.</i>
<i>They know what
they're doing.</i>
How long will it take to track her?
<i>Depending how much she's set
up, how long she stays on,</i>
<i>15 minutes, half hour at the most.</i>
Well, you call me the
second you find her.
<i>And that other matter, Mr. Devlin?</i>
<i>Oh, that's, um...
That's free of charge.</i>
Thanks.
No.
Well...
Yes.
Praetorians?
Praetorians, praetorians.
What?
I need more information.
‚ÄúBig bad wolf, cyber terrorists."
I need more information.
‚ÄúLAX, Wall Street, Atlanta.
Extremely dangerous.
Don't mess with them."
They've already started
messing with me.
‚ÄúMeet in IRL. In private."
In real life.
No, no, no.
It's gotta be a public place.
Where it's safe,
with a lot of people.
Like Santa Monica pier.
By... Where?
The Ferris Wheel.
- Any luck?
<i>- 8833 Rosewood</i>
<i>in West Hollywood.</i>
Remind me to buy you
guys something nice.
Hello.
Hello?
Angie.
Angie, come on. Let me in.
I'm dying out here with this food.
Sorry.
Sorry. I thought... You know.
Forget it. Hi.
I figured you'd be hungry,
so I stopped on the way over.
I got you your favorite, Chinese.
Um, it's your favorite. I never
really cared for it, remember?
That's immaterial. I knew
it was somebody's favorite.
How's my mom?
Mom is fine.
She's safely ensconced at the county
sanitarium. Everything's good.
Great. Thank you.
Hey, listen, about the Chinese,
let me make it up to you.
Why don't we go over to that
Greek restaurant we used to like?
I can't. I gotta go.
Really?
Why do you have to go? Every time I
see you now, you're running away.
No, I'm not. There's just a guy
from the Internet who might
know something
about what's going on.
Well, can I at least tell you about Ben
Phillips, the guy you wanted me to talk to?
I told him your story, and he said he wants
to see you first thing in the morning.
Angie, can't you wait until...
Well, does he know about LAX
and Wall Street and
what happened in Atlanta?
Of course he knows what happened in
Atlanta. What did happen in Atlanta?
A couple of kids black-out
part of a power grid
and spell "Braves suck"
from the air.
Is that a national emergency?
Christ, Alan, listen. Cyberbob figured
it out, and he knows what he's doing.
Okay? If I don't talk to him now,
it's gonna be too late.
Listen to you!
Cyberbob!
You're going to meet a
guy named Cyberbob!
Have you ever even seen him?
I don't want you going alone.
- Why don't you come with me?
- Sure I will.
Now, where are we
supposed to meet him?
Santa Monica pier.
Yeah?
Hi. Bob Fox?
These people are dangerous. They
killed Dale because of what he knew.
Now they think
I have this program.
Angie, I'm with you on this.
Really, I am.
But first, somebody tries to
kill you, now this guy Dale...
And they put somebody in my place at
Cathedral to get rid of any traces there.
Well, what I'm asking you is why would
anybody want to do any of this?
Okay, they would want somebody in
Cathedral's mainframe in order to set traps
and to overwrite any programs, just to make
sure that this doesn't happen again, right?
Well, that would take weeks,
and you cannot do that
from the outside.
Do you remember
that Internet number
that I told you
that Devlin guy had?
Well, I plugged it in,
and next thing I know,
I'm staring at, like,
the personal medical files
of the Under Secretary of
Defense, Michael Bergstrom.
The guy who blew his head off.
Yeah.
And they said that a computer blood
test told him he had AIDS, right?
Well, when they did the autopsy,
there was no HIV found.
Well, who knows? Maybe
when they do my autopsy,
I can finally prove
that I'm not Ruth Marx.
You know,
what's frightening me is I'm starting
to think that you're not delusional.
You know what I need to do,
I need to get back to Cathedral,
I need to get on that Mozart's Ghost
program because that's gotta be it.
That has to be it. They've got this
echo system on their computers there
where you can retrace all your
keystrokes in case you made a mistake.
You... Are you all right?
Alan, what's the matter?
Pull over. Alan.
- You're scaring me! Come on!
- Pills.
- Talk to me. What?
- The pills.
What pills? What?
What are you talking about?
You know what, get over here.
We'll go to the hospital.
He'll be okay, isn't he?
Well, he's allergic to penicillin.
They have him intubated and
pumped full of epinephrine.
I have no idea what you just said.
Look, he's going to be fine.
If you like, you can go see him now.
Um...
Yeah, I would like that.
Thank you.
Hi.
How do you feel?
I'm starving.
Yeah?
Well, the minute you get out,
I'll cook you
the best microwave meal
you've ever had.
How long are they gonna
keep me here?
Um, I think just another day.
And will you be handling
the outpatient care, nurse?
Well, do you mind?
Mm-mm.
Visions of sponge baths
dance in my head.
I gotta go.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'm more worried about you.
I'll be fine.
Wish it was over, but I'll be fine.
I know.
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.
Come closer.
I've wanted to do that
since yesterday.
Yeah, well,
when you get better,
I might let you do it again.
Mm.
Do you still think I'm crazy?
Sure I do.
Always have.
Get your cotton
candy here! 50 cents!
Cotton candy!
Great picture! Bye!
Hey! How you doing?
Howdy!
Everybody's a winner!
Everybody's a winner! Step right up!
Hey, honey, wanna dance?
Come on,
give Benny a big hug!
Just get...
Come on back here!
I'm a great dancer! Look at my feet!
Knock the milk bottles down!
Look out! Aah.
Safer to stay right here.
Sorry, Bob couldn't make it.
Hey. Hey.
Hey, I hope this isn't how you
greet all your old lovers.
That's not exactly the category
that you fit into.
No?
I'm surprised you didn't
kill me, then fuck me.
Listen. It was difficult, right?
Because I was attracted
to you. I still am.
I'm genuinely attracted to you.
Yeah, well, I'm gonna genuinely attract
half the Santa Monica Police Department
if you don't let go of me now.
Yeah? I know you've been avoiding
them since you ran out of that house.
Well, I'm sure they'd
still be very interested
in hearing how you crashed Dale Hessman's
plane, how you tried to kill me.
I'm sure they'd love
to hear about that.
You go ahead. You feel free. I'm sure
they'd be happy to make your acquaintance.
Did you know that Ruth Marx
has a criminal record?
For drugs, prostitution.
You've got quite a record.
Yeah, almost as good a record
as Bergstrom has, huh?
What do you mean?
I know about Bergstrom's suicide.
And I know all about
the praetorians too,
so I'm sure they'd
love to hear about that.
- One, two, three, four!
- Everybody has their button,
and Bergstrom's just happened
to be homophobia.
You just have to know people
well enough to know which...
Which button to push.
I don't have your disk. If I had it, I
would give it to you. I don't have it.
Okay.
It was ruined in Mexico.
It's okay.
But what we need now is what's
up here, so you come with me.
I promise you, I promise you
I'll look after you. Come on.
See you later.
Hi! Excuse me!
I don't understand.
What do you want?
It's not about what I want.
It's about what my employers want.
So take a look around you.
Do you think things are working?
I don't think so.
They believe they can
make things better.
What? By killing people?
I don't ask too many questions
and I suggest you do the same.
Come on!
Let's dance! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
What are you... Don't push!
Hey, you jerk! Jeez!
<i>Dr. Henry to I.C.U.</i>
<i>Dr. Henry to I.C.U.</i>
<i>Dr. Herb Fields, staff to
ambulance bay.</i>
<i>Code blue, 151 west.
Code blue, 151 west.</i>
Let's go ahead
and defibrillate!
Everybody clear?
Three hundred. Let's go.
Let's go, everybody. Clear!
Okay, he's got no pulse. He's not
responding. Get her out of here!
No! No. He's my friend.
He's my friend. He's my friend.
- Please help me!
- No! No! Let me go!
Let's go!
- Go ahead and hit him again! Clear!
- No! No! Let go of me!
Alan, no.
Get off of me!
Look, Mrs. Champion, I'm sorry.
We did everything we could.
I'm not Mrs. Champion.
There were complications.
Would you like me to
call you a cab?
Look, you're very upset. Is there
someone who can pick you up?
Ma'am.
Ma'am, would you like to talk
with a counselor?
Ma'am, maybe you should just
lie down for a while.
I don't understand. You said he
was gonna be fine.
He was fine.
I know I did. I'm sorry. We think the
insulin caused his blood pressure...
No, no, it was penicillin.
He was on penicillin.
No, Dr. Champion was being held
for the treatment of diabetes.
- No. No. No.
- He went into insulin shock.
No. He was not a diabetic.
I'm afraid he was. I can pull up his files.
No, he wasn't diabetic!
I don't know how much
longer it's gonna be.
Yeah.
All right, watch your step here.
Aw, man, I didn't do it!
Take it easy.
We're just...
Hello.
You've no idea what it does to me
just hearing the sound of your voice.
<i>No, don't hang up, Angela.
Please.</i>
<i>This is important.</i>
If you would just take a step
back from all of this, you'd...
You'd see that you and I,
we're really not so very different.
<i>We're both loners.
We're both isolated.</i>
<i>We're both really untrusting.</i>
We're both looking for
the same clarity.
<i>You've come to mean
a great deal to me.</i>
Yeah, well, you mean shit to me.
Look, I have to admit an arrogance
in my perceptions of you.
<i>You see, I've come to visit
a friend of mine,</i>
an old piano teacher friend of mine.
You leave my mother alone.
<i>Well, it seems I have no choice.</i>
<i>She's been moved by Dr. Champion.</i>
The late Dr. Champion.
Shit.
Driver, this is the highway patrol.
Reduce speed, carefully pull
over to the side of the highway
and turn off your engine.
God!
Now, there it is!
There.
There she is! Police!
Stop!
Unh. Stop!
My name is Angela Bennett.
I am Angela...
My name...
- Freeze!
- Police!
My name's Angela Bennett.
Get down! Get down! Get your
hands around back.
Around the back!
You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up the right to
remain silent, anything you say
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
You have the right
to speak to an attorney
and to have that attorney
present during questioning.
<i>Look. I wanna help you.</i>
<i>I've been appointed to help you,</i>
but everything you're saying
is just so farfetched.
They've changed your name, your friend's
medical records, crashed planes, because...
Just think about it.
Just think about it.
Our whole world is sitting
there on a computer.
It's in the computer. Everything.
Your DMV records,
your social security,
your credit cards,
your medical history,
it's all right there.
Everyone is stored, and there's
like this little electronic shadow
on each and every one of us that's just
begging for somebody to screw with.
And you know what?
They've done it to me,
and you know what?
They're gonna do it to you.
Look, Miss Marx...
Um...
I'm not Ruth Marx, okay?
They invented her.
They put her on your
computer with my thumbprint.
I hate to tell you this, but the
California criminal justice computers,
all of them, have been protected by
the Gatekeeper security programs
for the last six months, so nothing that
you're describing could possibly happen.
Oh, my God.
It's the program, then.
It's the Gatekeeper program.
It's got... It has a flaw.
If they changed my identity and it has a
flaw, then the praetorians know this.
Then that solves it.
Yeah. Think about it.
No. You want to tell me again
how you ended up in a stolen car?
Okay. Okay, listen to me.
It's like...
It's like
a Trojan horse, this thing.
The praetorians, they hack into
computers and they cause this chaos.
Um, LAX. Uh, Wall Street.
Um, the Department of Water
and Power in Atlanta.
They do this so the people, they
go out and they buy this program.
They buy this program and
they get a false sense of security,
only to find out that they've
unwittingly allowed the praetorians
free and exclusive access
to the system. Do you get it?
Imagine what they can do with
this power. They could do anything.
This is absolutely fascinating,
Ms. Marx.
Please. My name is Bennett.
Write it down if you want.
It's Bennett.
B-E-N-N-E-T-T. Bennett.
I have no reason to
make any of this up.
As your court-appointed attorney,
I'm obligated to do what you wish,
so I will call you "Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile" if you want.
But take some advice.
If you go before the judge
with this craziness,
I guarantee you will be found
incompetent to stand trial,
and they will hold you indefinitely.
Hi.
Yeah, this is her daughter.
Hi, Mom.
It's me.
How are you doing?
You doing okay?
Yeah? How's that
new nurse treating... Is she...
Um, uh... It's Angela, Mom.
Uh, it's Angela.
Mom, listen. Um...
I need you to do something for me.
Um, there's a lady here
that I need for you...
She's gonna get on the phone, and I
need for you to tell her that she's...
That I'm me, okay?
Because she doesn't believe me.
Can you tell her that, Mom?
Mom, don't. No.
Are you there?
I just want
you to know that I love you and...
Lady.
What?
What?
Would somebody answer
the damn phone?
Here she is.
Who's come to get me? Can you just...
Special agent Ben Phillips, FBI.
I'm Alan's friend.
It's a terrible thing,
what happened to him.
I'm... I'm so glad
that you're here. I...
Angela, two seconds
after Alan told me your story,
half the agents
in the Computer Crimes Division
hit the bricks chasing this down,
most of them beating every bush from
here to eternity trying to find you.
Sorry it ended up being
in a place like this.
Yeah, me too.
Let's get out of here,
get you someplace safe.
We've got a field office
about 40 minutes from here.
Okay, and then what do we do?
Oh, then I'm going fishing.
A shark named Jack Devlin.
Ring any bells?
Yeah.
He's their one-man dirty-duty
squad. Smart, efficient, lethal.
Moral conscience of a chain saw.
Hm.
Scary a son of a bitch as he is, the guys
behind the keyboards, they're worse.
The praetorians.
Our first good lead. We've been
chasing them for years.
Look, we have to move
like ASAP here,
so I want you to start sketching
me a quick background, all right?
Okay. Um...
Like, uh, for instance, how the hell
did you access their
system in the first place?
I didn't. A programmer
at Cathedral sent the disk to me.
Goddamn disk. That's what
kick-started all this, huh?
Angie. Angie, tell me.
Did you make a copy of the disk?
I mean, before it was
ruined in Mexico.
Huh?
No.
Oh, damn.
<i>Disk is only
hope we have of catching these bastards.</i>
Did you talk to anyone, give
copies of the disk to anyone?
You guys are amazing
sons of bitches.
Excuse me?
Amazing. Amazing, amazing.
Huh?
How'd you know it was ruined?
How'd you know it was ruined?
I only told Devlin it was ruined.
How'd you know it was ruined? Huh?
What's your name? You're not even
with the FBI. It doesn't even matter.
Ever since I touched that disk, I've been
running from one nightmare to the next.
You know what? I'm tired. I am out
of it. I'm so out of it. I'm tired.
Hey! What are you doing?
Come on, get off the gas!
<i>Let go! You're gonna kill us!
You'll kill us both!</i>
Let go!
My seat belt!
<i>On a serious note,</i>
<i>after what has appeared to be a month of
playful but costly computer tampering,</i>
<i>an incident today
has taken a darker turn.</i>
<i>We go live to Dermot Conley
in Chicago with that report.</i>
<i>Police were called in as the
recent comedy of computer errors</i>
<i>turned ugly today when six of Chicago's
major banks were forced to shut their doors</i>
<i>due to massive computer tampering,</i>
<i>bringing the economic life of
this city to a halt.</i>
<i>As you can see,
it's a desperate situation.</i>
<i>Essential city services
will be conducted</i>
<i>through the one local bank
unaffected by the glitches.</i>
<i>That bank, National Fidelity,
sources say,</i>
<i>was protected by Gregg Systems'
aptly named Gatekeeper program.</i>
<i>Reporting live from Chicago's
loop, Dermot Conley.</i>
<i>Thank you, Dermot.</i>
<i>In related news, Jeff Gregg,</i>
<i>billionaire founder of Gregg Systems, was
in Washington for today's announcement</i>
<i>by newly appointed Under Secretary
of Defense Calvin Shoemaker</i>
<i>that the Pentagon will be outfitting</i>
<i>the entire federal government with
Gregg's touted Gatekeeper program.</i>
<i>You need to remember, in this day
and age, information is sacred.</i>
<i>Information is power,</i>
<i>and society must protect that at
all costs from these terrorists.</i>
<i>Ironically, today's
announcement came</i>
<i>just two weeks to the day of
the recent suicide death of</i>
<i>Shoemaker's predecessor,
Michael Bergstrom,</i>
<i>a vocal opponent
of the Gatekeeper program.</i>
<i>In local news, a spectacular car crash
leaves one unidentified man dead.</i>
<i>We go live to Lynn Blades at
the scene of the crash. Lynn.</i>
<i>Thank you, Elaine. Now, lam just yards
away from where the body was found</i>
<i>with a gangland-style gunshot
wound to the head.</i>
<i>Police are searching for
the passenger of that car,</i>
<i>a young woman in her '20s, brunette,
going under the name of Ruth Marx</i>
<i>and believed to be wanted on federal charges
of car theft. Little else is known...</i>
<i>All Cathedral employees,</i>
<i>this is a reminder that
the Cathedral booth</i>

<i>All Cathedral employees, this
is a reminder that the Cathedral booth</i>
<i>in the Moscone Center is in the
northwest corner of the convention hall.</i>
Okay. All right.
<i>Mozart's ghost!
The hottest band...</i>
Oh. Don't do this to me. Do not do
this to me. I am Angela Bennett.
Me. Okay.
Okay. Where are you?
<i>Cathedral software.
Yeah. Angela Bennett, please.</i>
Programing.
Angela Bennett. Hello.
Hello?
Who the hell is this?
Hello. Look, you got
something to say? Otherwise...
Don't hang up.
Angela?
All right, Miss Bennett,
now that I know where you are,
let's see if we can get you away
from your machine.
<i>Hm.</i>
How about I start a little fire,
right here?
<i>This is a fire alarm.</i>
<i>Please proceed to
the nearest emergency exit.</i>
<i>Please proceed
to the nearest exit.</i>
- Angela.
- What?
Who are you? Our lady of asbestos?
There's a goddamn fire in the building.
Yeah, yeah. Just a sec.
Don't give me "a sec."
Let's go.
Hang on.
Now! Come on!
Okay.
<i>Mozart's ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet!</i>
About time.
Oh, the password.
Password nairot... Nairot...
Where are you?
We're not going back!
If there's a fire, where's the smoke?
There's no smoke.
We're looking into it, ma'am.
Okay, what's this? "Terminate all
Mozart's Ghost files now. Terminate..."
Oh. Gotcha, don't I?
Okay, now, who is praetorian?
Okay. Okay.
Okay, let's search you out.
<i>- It's Gregg.
- Attention, employees.</i>
Okay.
<i>Please return to your workstations.</i>
<i>The fire department has advised us
that this was a false alarm.</i>
<i>Attention,
all Cathedral employees.</i>
<i>- Return to your workstations.</i>
- All clear!
<i>The fire department has advised
us that this was a false alarm.</i>
Subnet 345.
Come on.
Okay, where are you?
There you go.
Come on. Come on.
<i>Attention,
all Cathedral employees.</i>
<i>Please return
to your workstations.</i>
<i>The fire department has advised us
that this was a false alarm.</i>
<i>Attention, all Cathedral employees.</i>
<i>Please return
to your workstations.</i>
So you did do this, didn't you?
<i>This was a false alarm.</i>
Come on.
You gotta go to the john too, huh?
Disk, disk. Where are you?
Where are your disks?
Virus. Thank you, Dale.
Okay.
Save.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Come on.
Save. Come on, come on.
Yes.
Thank you.
You're going to the convention.
Oh, my God.
Security.
Had a break-in on the fifth
floor of Cathedral.
You're looking for a female,
about 5'7", brunette.
Did you see a brunette?
Did she come by here?
Sorry, ma'am.
Nobody came by here.
Only people coming and going
around here are firemen.
Devlin.
Where is she?
She's gotta be with the firemen.
We have to find her now.
She's copied the disk.
Well, how the hell did that happen?
You were supposed
to get rid of everything.
And you were supposed to have
put a bullet in her head a week ago.
She should never have been alive
to make that copy.
Heh. Smart.
Better call Gregg.
She's gone to
the Moscone Center!
Jesus, she could be anywhere.
Are you sure she's out there?
She's out there, all right.
And she won't be hiding
in some corner.
She came here to use a computer.
Get away from the computer.
What did you think
you were trying to do?
Save the world?
No, not the world. Just myself.
Oh.
Well, I'm afraid it's too late for that.
The offer's been withdrawn.
You might wanna look at the screen,
because everything on that disk
was just sent to the FBI.
Everything.
So?
So, proof that the Gatekeeper
program has a back door.
My. my.
Proof that Bergstrom and Dale's
murder were orchestrated by Gregg.
Watch her.
The beauty of the Gatekeeper system is
that we can get in and out of the FBI
like it's the public library.
It's a beautiful system.
Let's finish the work and get the hell out
of here. These people make me nervous.
No harm done. Everything
you've done will be wiped out
by just escaping the system.
Really?
Goddamn it,
you're in the mainframe.
It's eating through Gregg's entire
system, Devlin. Do something.
It's a virus eating through Gatekeeper.
Shit!
There's gonna be nothing
left. Everything will be destroyed.
Take the far side!
Angela, stop!
Angela!
Shit.
Angela.
Angela?
It's just you and me now.
Do you realize you've
changed everything?
Yeah.
One little stroke of the key and
you've wiped out my employer.
You've canceled my contract.
You've reversed everything they've
done to you, taken back your life.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?
Angela?
I knew you'd do the right thing.
This is the latest virus checker.
It's in this machine?
It's not responding to anything.
Try a new password.
Excuse me, uh, miss.
I can't remember what you
told me to plant.
You know what? Why don't I
come outside and help you?
