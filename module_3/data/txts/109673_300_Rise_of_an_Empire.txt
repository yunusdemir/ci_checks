The oracle's words stand
as a warning.
A prophecy.
Sparta will fall.
All of Greece will fall.
And Persian fire will reduce
Athens to cinder.
For, Athens is a pile of stone
and wood and cloth and dust.
And as dust will vanish into
the wind.
Only the Athenians themselves
exist.
And the fate of the world hangs
on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships
can save them.
Wooden ships... and a tidal
wave of heroes' blood.
Leonidas, my husband.
Leonidas, your king.
Leonidas and the brave three
hundred, are dead.
The free men and women of Greece...
are not bound by a beautiful
Spartan death.
War is not their love, yet he
lay down his life for them...
for the promise Greece holds.
Tis our enemies who forged our
freedom in the fires of war.
It was King Darius who came
to take our land.
Ten years ago, when (inaudible)
burned in our eyes...
before this bitter war forced
our children to become men.
Ten years ago this war began...
as all wars begin... with a
grievance.
Marathon.
The Persian king Darius...
annoyed by the notion of
Greek freedom...
has come to Greece to bring
us to heel.
He makes land full of the field
of Marathon with an invading...
force which outnumbers the
Greek defenders, three to one.
And so at dawn, the hopeless
Athenians do the unthinkable.
They attack.
They attack the weary Persians
as they disembark...
their ships on shaky legs,
after a month at sea.
They attack before they can
establish their war camp...
and supply their soldiers.
And who is the architect of
this mad strategy?
A little known Athenian soldier...
his men called him... Themistocles.
He gives the Persians the taste
of Athenian shock combat.
All thoughts of glory are gone.
Thousands dead, hundreds of
them their own...
all for an idea, a free Greece...
an Athenian experiment called
democracy.
Could this idea be worthy?
Worth all this sacrifice?
Themistocles would let the good
King Darius decide.
For through the chaos, a moment
appeared...
and Themistocles would seize it.
A moment that would ring across
the centuries...
a moment that would raise him
from simple soldier...
to the height of the Athenian
political power.
No...
A moment that would make
Themistocles a legend.
Yet even as the praise and
glory were heaped upon him...
Themistocles knew in his heart
he had made a mistake.
It was Darius' son, Xerxes.
His eyes have the streak of
destiny about them.
Themistocles knew he should've
killed that boy.
That glorious mistake would
forever haunt him.
And so it was Themistocles
himself who sent a ripple...
across the Persian empire.
And set into motion forces
that would bring fire...
to the heart of Greece.
For as the good king lay dying...
all his greatest generals and
advisers...
were summoned to his bedside...
none greater than his finest
naval commander...
Artemisia.
Her ferocity bested only by
her beauty.
Her beauty matched only by
her devotion to her king.
Darius favored Artemisia among
his generals...
for she has brought him victory
on the battlefield.
In her, he had the perfect
warrior...
protege that his son Xerxes
would never be.
So sweet... my child.
My sweet... child.
Father...
Xerxes... do not repeat your
father's mistake.
Leave the noble Greece to
the waves.
Only the gods can defeat them.
Only... the gods.
For seven days Xerxes mourned,
paralyzed by grief.
On the 8th day...
Artemisia whispered the seed of
madness that would consume him.
Your father's words are not
a warning...
but a challenge.
"Only the gods can defeat
the Greeks?"
You will be a God-King.
Artemisia gathered the priests,
wizards and mystics...
from every corner of the empire.
They wrapped the young king
in Sumerian gores...
dipped in ancient potions...
and set him to wonder the desert.
Till, in a delirium of heat
and thirst...
he stumbled upon a hermit's
cave.
Xerxes passed the vacant eyes...
and empty souls of the hollowed
creatures that dwell...
in the dark corners of all
mens' hearts.
And in that darkness...
he surrendered himself
completely...
to power so evil and perverse.
As he emerged... no part of the
human man that was Xerxes survived.
His eyes blaze like scarlet
coals.
He was stripped, cleansed,
glamorous and smooth.
Xerxes was reborn a god.
Artemisia trusted no one.
So in the cover of night...
the palace was cleansed of
all Xerxes' allies.
All those he trusted.
All those who had raised him.
All those he had once looked
to for counsel...
were quickly introduced to
her wrath.
And as the God-King stood
before his people...
Artemisia watched her flawless
manipulation take shape.
For glory's sake...
for vengence sake...
War!
War is coming to Greece.
In the visage of a monster
army, over a million strong.
It should be little more than
a formality for Themistocles...
the hero of Marathon...
to finish what he began.
Please, we must appeal to
Xerxes' reasons.
Coward!
Athens is a city of cowards!
Shut your cockhole!
Shut your own!
I'll kill you, Spartans!
Silence!
Silence, for the hero of Marathon!
This is a democracy, not
a street fight!
The Persian attack...
will come from both the north,
and the south.
The City-States should negotiate
a truce.
Yes, yes, we must negotiate!
Negotiating with tyranny...
give me one example of when that
has ever profited a nation.
My fellow countrymen, we can
only judge the future...
from what we have suffered
in the past.
Now many of you here stood
with me at Marathon...
and for those of you who
served...
and faced the cut and thrust
of battle...
you know how true peace is
forged.
Do not be deceived.
Xerxes, the son of Darius is
a wolf at our door.
Right here, right now.
We must choose. Do we stand
and fight for Greece, or not?
Argos...
Corinth, Megara, Athens...
not even Sparta can match
the Persians alone.
We must persevere as one
nation...
or we'll perish clinging on
to our own self-interests.
Send us the ships that we
need to defend Greece.
Themistocles would need more
than our city's ships.
He'll need our children to
join the fight.
And what of Sparta?
We send every ship that we have...
to the northern coast of Euboea.
I will go and seek the help...
of the great Spartans...
Still no word from the messenger
you sent to Sparta.
King Leonidas may have been
insulted by your generous offer.
Perhaps I need to march to
Sparta myself...
and burn it to the ground.
Remember... when a king is
loved as I am...
much can be accomplished.
He will be forced to resist
my divine power.
Athens is attempting to assemble
a coalition.
It will be nothing more than
a patched work of ships.
Once these waters have been
traversed, I will lead my force...
across the land.
I will remind the cowards of
Greece...
that we have not forgotten their
insolence.
Rest and water the horses.
It's best I go alone.
Spartans... don't get along well
with others.
Spartans...
Themistocles... you old snake.
What brings you this far south?
I've come to see Leonidas, to
warn him that the Persians...
are on the march.
Well, you're too late.
A Persian messenger already
presented his terms to Leonidas.
A symbolic offer, of earth
and water.
Spartans!
Know this, and know it well.
Today Spartan's finest moment...
the greatest fullfilment of all
he holds dear...
is that moment...
when he has fought his heart
out for the preservation...
of Sparta... and lies dead
on the battlefield.
Victorious!
Now... who is willing to die
at our king's side?
Themistocles.
You've come a long way to stroke
your cock...
while watching real men train.
Queen Gorgo, shouldn't you be
training them...
to live at their king's side?
A new age is dawning, Gorgo.
It won't be long before men
rise up...
and shatter the yoke of mysticism
and tyranny.
That sounds like a threat.
No.
An opportunity to join the rest
of free Greece...
and stand against the true
tyrant.
Unless of course, you and
Leonidas...
have already made a deal with
Xerxes.
No terms were reached.
Xerxes' messenger was... well,
he was rude and lacked respect.
He didn't understand the same
threats made in Thebes and Athens...
would not work here.
This is the birthplace of the
world's greatest warriors.
Men whose king would stand and
fight and die...
for any one of them.
Xerxes' messenger did not
understand...
this is no typical Greek
City-State.
This is Sparta.
So it was clear to the messenger
there would be...
no Spartan submission.
It was clear.
Even now, Leonidas is in council
with the oracle...
over his battle plan.
The Festival of the Carneia is
all that stands in our way.
Surely the oracle will see
we must fight.
Then my timing is perfect.
I am commanding a fleet of
ships...
that will represent a united
Greece.
I need Sparta to join me.
Give me your ships, Gorgo.
I will make sure that Xerxes...
wishes he'd never crossed
the Aegean.
You will receive no Spartan
ships, we're not interested...
in united Greece.
That is your dream, Themistocles,
not ours.
All I am concerned with, is
the preservation of Sparta.
My guards will see you out.
It's funny that you mock freedom
here in your selfish isolation...
yet freedom in her wisdom...
has chosen you to defend her.
My Queen.
Will Sparta join our fight?
Apparently the Persians have
offered the Spartans...
something they cannot refuse.
And what is that?
A beautiful death.
They say you are the bravest
of our captives.
They say you are a whore from
the Eastern seas.
You are not the smartest.
Your commander is a Greek,
just like me.
You Persian men, take your
orders from a Greek woman.
Yes my brother, I am Greek
by birth...
And I have Greek blood running
through my veins.
But my heart...
is Persian.
Within hours...
the Greek fleet will be shattered.
What about our Master and
the much feared Spartans?
There is nothing to fear.
Only King Leonidas and his
personal guard of three hundred...
have marched to fight.
They'll collapse instantly.
You...
do you agree?
Many will perish.
Your confidence leaves me with
a strong impression.
It's a curious thing for
a simple ship guard...
to not lower his eyes when
questioned by me.
That could've been just a lack
of discipline.
A man's hands do not lie.
They can reveal every imperfection
and flaw in his character.
You see, your hands are not
rough enough...
to work the rigging of the ship.
I know every single man beneath
my lash. You explain to me...
how I don't know you?
Forgive me, Commander.
Let me introduce myself.
Seize the spy!
Coward.
The storm is upon us.
It's just some mad Greek weather.
Themistocles... come.
Calisto... what's spoken here
must not be repeated.
Anywhere.
My son has not earned the
right to sit at the table...
of combat veterans, but you
can trust him.
Very well.
Tell me.
A Greek woman commands all the
Xerxes' ships, to the south.
Artemisia...
I know of her.
Artemisia is murderous by trait,
with true skills on the sea...
and she has thirst for vengeance.
Rumors are her entire family
was murdered...
by a squad of Greek Hoplites.
I have heard all the stories.
And the Hoplites spared no one,
on that day.
The story goes that they raped
and murdered her entire family.
Then they turned their attention
towards her.
After years of being kept in the
bowels of a Greek slave ship...
she was discarded and left
for dead...
where she was found near death
by a Persian emissary.
Artemisia vowed that day to
return to Greece...
only when she could watch
it burn.
She was fed, clothed and trained
by the finest warriors...
of the Persian empire...
until no match could be found...
for her skills and gift for the
sword.
The great King Darius was
impressed by her commitment.
And she quickly rose to command
at his side.
He has sold her soul to
death himself.
Well, some could say that I've
sold mine to Greece.
What do you think?
Me?
Yes, you are the future of
this country.
I am ready to fight.
I like him... reminds me of you.
We will need every last man.
Well, he's still just a boy.
Much younger have defended our
country, father.
Enough!
You're a dreamer who will
speak of this, no more.
Themistocles, I've set your
plan in motion...
and my land force will be
assembled by the second day.
You won't be needing it...
I can assure you of that.
Now, there's bad news.
Leonidas has marched North,
to the Hot Gates.
Bad news?
The Spartans at the Hot Gates?
Our victory is assured.
If the army were with him...
but, between the Oracle and the
Carnea...
Leonidas has marched to
Thermopylae...
with just three hundred men.
So, the only thing standing...
between Athens and total
annihilation...
is Leonidas, and three hundred
Spartans.
Go search out the veterans
among the army.
Establish an order around the
volunteers.
Good. There's little time to
teach these farm-hands strategy.
Just keep them well fed...
and sober.
Anything else?
It wouldn't hurt if they could
swing a sword.
Oh, I'll be damned.
Shit!
Does your father know that
you're here?
No, sir.
And this shield and sword?
My grandfathers'.
My mother entrusted them to me,
this morning.
And she gave you her blessing?
Yes, sir.
With a sharp blade, none
the less.
Your father is preparing a
surprise raid, early tomorrow.
I choose to fight here, now.
Come aboard my ship.
That is where you will fight.
Yes, sir.
We just total fifty ships.
Persian forces reported to number
in the thousands.
Those ships appear hardly
sea-worthy.
There're nothing like the monstrous
ships of the Persian fleet.
Then we have the advantage.
Speed and maneuverability.
The rest of the City-States is
sending any where from a handful...
to a single ship.
Of course Athens... supply
the balance.
We have report that a small
advanced force...
of Persian ships...
have taken refuge from the storm,
just across the strait.
If the weather breaks, we could
hit them at dawn.
An early Greek victory.
The gods have given us an
opportunity to wound...
the Persians and strengthen
Greek morale.
Attempting distraction.
We'll stick to the battle plan.
Today at sundown we will sail
out to meet...
the main Persian fleet.
We'll attack them in the open
water...
with no shore to narrow the
battle.
To attack a force over a thousand
ships, with our meager force...
is suicide.
Such is my plan.
Look at their excuse for a navy.
Their ships are of little threat.
I need a second in command,
Achmenes.
And whoever proves their excellence,
will own place beside me.
General Bandari has offered
to lead the first attack.
Bandari!
Commander?
I'll let you lead our first
offensive.
What guarantee do I have that
you'll bring me a quick victory?
My word, and my life.
Good.
My rules of engagement?
Humiliate the Greeks and lay
waste to their tiny ships.
They'll be dead to the last man.
My brothers, steady your hearts.
Look deep into your souls.
For your mettle is to be tested,
this day.
If, in the heat of battle...
you need a reason to fight on...
an idea... for which you would
give up...
all that you will ever have...
you need only to look at the
man who fights at your side.
This is the "why" of battle.
This is the brotherhood of men
at arms.
An unbreakable bond, made stronger
by the crucible of combat.
You'll never be closer than with
those you shed your blood with.
For there's no nobler cause
than to fight for those...
who'll lay down their lives
for you.
Well, you fight strong, today.
You fight for your brothers!
Fight for your families!
Most of all, you fight for Greece!
Hey! There's only one thing
to make sure of...
when the fighting starts.
What's that?
Don't get killed on the first
day.
That goes for the rest of you.
The Persian ships are strong
at the front...
but they're weak in the middle.
We attack them there.
Now!
Ram them!
Reverse!
Now!
Go through them.
The enemy's tactics are creative.
The defensive circle leaves
no front to assault.
We're losing.
No, you're losing.
Pull back.
Let them have this day.
I'm bored with your failures,
Bandari.
I'll not let this wound
slow me.
Somehow, I believe you.
My blade will be sharp and
ready by the morning.
Good. Tomorrow you'll fight
alongside your father.
Not bad for a bunch of farmers.
And poets, and sculptors.
Who would've known that a group
of untrained men...
would do so well against such
a considerable adversary.
We're gonna need all of our
strength for tomorrow's fight.
How long do you think we can
hold them?
If my plan is to work...
long enough for the Spartans
to unite Greece.
Men, who'll share their wine
with me?
Report!
We're still tallying the losses...
but you must understand, it's
extremely difficult...
given the sea and the darkness,
to get an accurate report!
Report?
Seventy-five ships lost.
Thirty damaged beyond repair.
Twenty could return with a few
weeks' work in a safe harbour.
The commander of the Greek
force is named Themistocles.
Yes, he is an Athenian general.
He's rumored to have loose the
arrow that fell...
the great king Darius, himself.
This Themistocles has shown
himself...
to be quite brilliant in battle.
Which is more than I can say
for any of you.
Do you gentlemen find my
command unreasonable?
Is it too much to ask for
victory?
Your disappointment in yesterday's
losses is warranted.
My disappointment?
My disappointment is not with
my losses.
A meager number of damaged ships
and dead slaves...
means nothing to me.
No...
my disappointment...
is in these men.
For though I stand among
ten thousand...
I am alone.
I long for a soul who would stand
by my side...
who I could trust.
Tell me General Kashani, are
you that man?
You'll taste your victory by
the day's end.
I'll make certain of it.
I hope so.
Advance!
Now!
Don't lose sight of them!
The Greeks are retreating.
He's got him right where he
wants him.
Kashani is a fine tactician.
I was speaking of Themistocles.
Rocks!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Brace yourselves.
What are you doing here?
A man's responsibility is...
to protect his family and
his nation.
Who told you this?
My father.
You see how Themistocles employs
deception with such grace?
Why's it so much to ask
for victory?
How can I make a...
Silence.
You will carry a massage for me.
Now they will fear us!
Now they will fear the Greek men
at arms!
He's right!
Fear the Greek fighting man.
Fear his sword, his shield.
Fear his love for mother Greece...
but most of all...
fear his freedom!
Don't be angry with the boy.
I took him under my command.
Anger is something I reserve
for my enemies.
Themistocles!
Artemisia's ship is being
anchored in neutral waters.
She'd like to meet with
Themistocles.
How can you gurantee his
safe return?
Well boy, the only honor for
her now...
will be when she watches your
crushed...
and broken fleet sink into
the bottom of the Aegean...
and is able to recognize you...
nailed to the mast of your ship
with her sword...
as you descend to a watery grave.
Why didn't you just say that,
to begin with?
Welcome to my humble barge.
We are honored by your presence.
Your barge and you, are quite
impressive.
Kind words.
Now come Themistocles, we've
much to discuss.
Do you believe the Greeks have
descendant from the gods?
I've heard some said that.
And what of you?
Is there a god in your lineage?
My men say so, and based on the
last two days of battle...
I'd say there's a spark of the
divine in you.
Now, who's using kind words?
My men also say, that it was you
who slayed the good King Darius...
at Marathon.
Many heroic deeds occured on
that day.
It was ten years ago.
The facts of battle are often
embellished.
This deed you would remember.
I'll do what I must to defend
Greece.
And I'll do what I must to
defeat her.
For every one Greek killed, you
must kill a thousand Persians.
For every ship I sink...
you must sink a hundred.
I can sustain losses for weeks.
Months, if need be.
My numbers will defeat you, and
I will take your precious...
boats with my sword.
I will take your Greek freedom.
You're asking me to negotiate
a surrender?
No...
I offer you a chance to avoid
such misery, and join me.
I'm in a need of a commander
such as you.
Look at the defense you've
mounted.
A handful of triremes?
Leonidas with three hundred
Spartans?
It's insulting frankly, that
the mightiest empire...
the world has ever seen is
maimed by this.
I don't blame you, Themistocles.
You fought as if the blood of
Poseidon himself...
was coursing through your
veins.
No, I blame Greece.
The squabbling bureaucrats,
protecting their political hides...
by sending you here, to die.
And yet, you still fight.
So, there must be...
what?
A family back home in Athens,
that...
compels you to battle with such
passion?
The truth is I have no time
for family.
I have spent my entire adult
life with my one true love...
the Greek fleet.
And my one passion...
readying it for you.
Now, that brings me pleasure...
the thought of you pining away
for me...
forsaking family and love...
for the promise of a deeper
ecstasy.
The ecstasy of steel, and
flesh.
Death, and knife...
and rage... and sweat of muscle.
Of pure joy...
and deepest sorrow.
Die with me each night and be
born again with me each morning...
as you plunge your sword into
the hearts of our enemies.
you fight for freedom...
I offer freedom without consequence,
or responsibility.
Join me...
at my side.
Breathe each breath with me,
as if it were your last.
Join me.
No.
You're no god, you're just
a man.
Be quick with your sword.
You'll not have your death,
tonight.
Guards!
Remove this filth from my ship.
Well, what've you learned?
Can Artemisia be beaten?
The next time that we face
her...
she's going to bring all of
hell with her.
Send in my personal guard.
Pull back!
Retreat!
Retreat!
Themistocles, in the water!
Archers, archers now!
Archers on deck, now!
Quickly!
Starboard side.
Fire at will!
Fight on, boy.
Fight on!
Aim for the man on top!
Up there!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
The dead have no guilt.
No responsibility.
Themistocles watched as the bodies
of his men turn the Aegean...
red with blood.
Were they sacrificed for his
ego?
Or to relieve the guilt of the
long ago mistake, at Marathon?
How many men would have been
saved, if Themistocles...
had killed that boy.
Not even his own soul can
be sure.
My friend... we fight the
odds...
together.
Listen to me, Themistocles...
You'll have to fight with twice
as much strength, in the morning.
We'll fight shoulder to shoulder.
No, my son.
You will carry on for both
of us.
What did he say?
I will tell you in time, boy.
Be quiet now.
Go and be with your father's
spirit.
How many times do you think
we will repeat such a tragedy?
As many times as we must.
We're turning young men into
memories.
Do you think I enjoy this?
Witnessing my friend's final
breath.
Every widow that was made by
my decision.
Every child that will grow without
a father.
They are my choices.
This is the burden of my command.
How easy it is to silence the
strong and self-(inaudible).
Let my army witness the great
warriors of Sparta.
March them past these corpses.
Let them see the cost of daring
to challenge the God-King.
King Leonidas and his brave
three hundred...
were the finest Greece has
to offer.
There'll be no saviors to rise
up and vanquish us.
Nothing will stop the march
of my empire.
Your Majesty...
You... take this dead king's
sword to Athens.
Let them know that I am coming
next for them.
Let them know...
Athens, their prized jewel of
a city...
will disappear from the history.
Themistocles!
I bring word from Thermopylae.
Leonidas was betrayed by a
hunchback.
The Spartans have been
slaughtered.
The Hot Gates have fallen.
Such a sacrifice!
Now Greece has her martyr.
Daxos, take that message from
the Hot Gates...
to every city, every village...
and every countryman hear your
words.
But they're dead, all of them.
Sparta's sacrifice will be what
unite us.
Now, go!
Move all our ships and men back
to the safety of Salamis.
And you?
I'll take Daxos' message
to Athens.
I was told that a hunchback
was accountable...
for the fall of the Hot Gates.
As he sold out his country...
pulled the crimson from his
back, and replaced it...
with Persian gold.
What is your name, traitor?
Ephialtes of Thrace.
I should wet this noble blade
with your blood.
You'll be right to do so.
There's little beauty about me.
There's little beauty in what
I have done.
Say what you must.
I beg of you...
and all of Athens...
the God-King will burn this
city to the ground.
Quiet yourself!
Leonidas and Sparta's great
sacrifice...
was no defeat.
It was a beautiful victory.
This... simple act of valor...
will allow us to rally each
of our City-States...
and unite Greece.
For one purpose.
Against one enemy.
And you, you take this message
to your God-King...
We'll take whatever ships
we have left...
and finish this in the bay
of Salamis.
But there will be death and
destruction.
Yes.
There will be.
Themistocles.
I'm here to speak to your queen.
A warning Athenian, you may
not receive a warm welcome.
May I offer my deepest sympathies.
I cannot change what has
happened to Leonidas.
But his sacrifice will not
be forgotten.
Do not lecture me on sacrifice...
and be quick with your words,
Athenian.
I request of you the entire
Spartan navy.
Every man, every ship that you
can spare.
Have I not given enough for your
dream of a united Greece?
Shall I put swords in the hands
of my son, our children?
Would that please you?
Have I not given enough for
your ambitions, Themistocles?
A king... husbands, fathers,
brothers?
Sparta will give no more.
This belongs with you.
Avenge him!
The oracle's words stood as
a warning.
All of Greece will fall.
As Persian fire reduces Athens
to cinder.
For Athens is a pile of stone
and wood and cloth and dust.
And as dust would vanish into
the wind.
Only the Athenians themselves
exist.
And the fate of the world hangs
on their every syllable.
Only the Athenians exist.
And only stout wooden ships
can save them.
Wooden ships...
and a tidal wave of heroes'
blood.
The Greeks were fools to stand
against us.
Leonidas and his pride were no
match for the will of a god.
Themistocles was a worthless
coward.
And now, this pathetic navy is
barely worth of our attention.
That "worthless coward," had he
stood at my side...
we would have laid the world
at you feet.
My king!
Your humble servant...
brings you news.
The Greek fleet are defenseless,
within the bay of Salamis.
You need only to finish them.
Who commands their forces?
Themistocles of Athens.
Themistocles is dead.
He's alive.
I have seen him myself...
Ready my troops and armor.
We will attack at once.
Wisdom...
would have sent a probing force
to confirm it is not a trap.
You would dare to advise me in
matters of war?
I'm the God-King. I'm the one
who triumphed over Leonidas.
I am the one who laid waste
of the showpiece of Athens.
I am your king.
Killing Leonidas and his men
only made them martyrs.
And when you erased Athens...
you set fire to the only thing
of value, in this country.
I'll attack the Greeks with my
entire navy.
Artemisia, enough!
Do not forget who put the crown
on your childish head...
my king.
Now sit on your golden throne...
and watch this battle from the
safety I provide you.
There, in the distance...
we witness the destruction of
Athens.
Alone we will face the monster...
that cast a shadow across our
land.
I have prayed that the Spartans...
would come to lend a hand, this
morning.
Perhaps they feel they have
given enough.
You failed us all.
This is your fault, Themistocles.
Without Spartans we're just
farm-hands.
We should've negotiated with the
Persians when we had the chance.
You are all right.
Yes, we are down to a handful
of boats...
and yes, we're just farm-hands.
We're tradesmen.
We're boys...
turned to men through the
sacrifice and forge of combat.
I played a dangerous game, and
I lost!
If you choose to turn your back
on me, on your country...
I will not judge you.
You are free to leave.
You are still free men.
Very well.
Then, let us put our shoulders
to work...
and free those ships from the
bosom of Greece.
Today is a privilege to call
our own...
a story that would be told for
a thousand years.
Let our final stand be recorded
to the histories.
Let it be shown that we chose
to die on our feet...
rather than live on our knees!
There is only one thing you need
to know, today.
Not to get killed?
No.
Your father's last words.
He told me you have earned the
right to sit at the table.
Well, my brother, I've no more
tactics and tricks.
This will be the last battle
that we share.
We have fought next to one
another...
for as long as I can remember.
Nothing will please me more,
than to rest this sword.
The preparations that I required?
Below deck.
Good.
Are you sure that you want to
commit everything?
Yes.
Without Aretemisia's command,
the Persian navy is nothing.
We will never be able to
reach her.
I will reach her... and put an
end to this.
There will be no room for
a retreat.
I know.
Today, the last Greek ships will
be destroyed.
Show them no mercy!
Give them no quarter!
Today we will dance across
the backs of dead Greeks.
Today we deliver submission.
Today, I wanna feel Themistocles'
throat beneath my boots.
Men!
Brace yourselves.
Prepare for close quarters!
Attack!
Your father watches you!
Hold nothing back!
Seek your glory!
I'm not here as a witness!
Now!
And let them send their souls
straight to hell.
You offer freedom without
consequence, or responsibility.
Are you accepting my offer?
My answer is still no.
You fight much harder than
you fuck.
Surrender to me, or meet your
death.
Who would you fight, if not me?
No one could challenge your
skill.
I would rather die a free man,
than as a slave.
Even if the chain was attached
to you.
It begins as a whisper, a promise.
The lightest of breezes dances
through the rigging...
as it creeks above the death
cries of ten thousand men.
It moves through her hair as
gently as a lover's hand.
That breeze... that promise
became a wind.
A wind that has blown across
Greece, carrying a message...
told again and again of our
lady freedom.
And how wise she was, to charge
Leonidas to lay all at her feet.
A wind my brothers have
sacrificed.
A wind of freedom.
A wind of justice.
A wind of vengeance.
You're being surrounded. All of
Greece has united against you.
Delphi, Thebes, Olympia, Arcadia
and Sparta.
If death comes for me today,
I am ready.
I could lower my sword.
There is still time for you to
ready and launch an escape.
It would be a poor choice, to
force my hand into action.
Now order your ships to disengage
and surrender to me.
Surrender?
