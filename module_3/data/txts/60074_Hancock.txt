All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2- 11.
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.
Suspects: three Asian males.
Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.
Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?
As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus...
Oh, this is just coming in.
Hancock!
What, boy?
Bad guys.
- trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...
...shooting randomly on the freeway.
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.
Asshole.
- What?
- You heard me.
Please, stay off the freeway.
I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV...
Asshole.
Watch out!
Damn!
Damn it!
Hancock!?!
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy!'
Hancock is in the car...
...and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.
He smells like a bar!
You pay for new roof!
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...
...because your head
is going up my ass.
Shoot this asshole!
Stop!
What the fuck?
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.
What? I'm not Japanese, man!
Put us down!
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?
You broke my glasses.
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!
- Put us down!
- You want down?
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.
All right? All right.
This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...
...took a hefty financial toll.
Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...
...which, if accurate...
...represents a personal record...
...for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...
...who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.
With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...
...L.A. Would be better off
if this guy would leave...
...and let us get on with our jobs.
Hi.
Don't think I'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. I found you.
I got you.
So, what's it like when you fly?
- No, what?
- I ain't gonna fly you.
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...
...and I swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.
She crashed her car up in Malibu
and you flew her to the hospital.
Remember?
I will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.
You got a car?
Hey, want a drink?
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.
Your Batcave.
Your Fortress of Solitude.
- It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
- What's all this?
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.
- What do you do with it?
- Pop it.
- Jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
- Hey, hey.
Hold on.
Want me to give you
something else to pop?
- I didn't catch your name.
- Pop this, Superman.
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.
- All right. Now, there are some rules.
- Hello?
- No, I know, I haven't seen it yet.
- Excuse me.
I know, probably. All right, all right.
- Let me call you back.
- Listen.
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, I need you...
- Hey, that's... That's not focusing.
- What's in there?
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...
...when I get to the moment...
- The moment?
You know, the... Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?
- You know... All right? Yes.
- Yeah.
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.
- Far. That's hot.
- No, that's not hot. It's not hot.
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.
Hancock. Oh, yeah.
- Now you're doing too much.
- Hancock.
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!
Mountaintop! Watch out!
Sorry.
That's not fair to anybody.
Thank you for being okay with that.
- I know it's...
- Can I use the bathroom, please?
Yeah. Hey, you...?
You want some Jiffy Pop?
- No, thanks.
- It's straight back.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.
Hey...
Listen... You know, if you want
I could fly you.
It's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.
You could see the...
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.
What do you think?
Sir? Ray Embrey.
- Ray.
- Pleasure.
- So...
- Ray's like the Bono of P.R.
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.
Well, let's see it.
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...
...and you get an armband,
or a ribbon or whatever.
It's nowhere near enough.
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...
...the AllHeart symbol.
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...
...to bear this logo on your product.
And what this would say
to the public...
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.
Here's all you need to do to qualify.
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.
Only to those who need it.
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.
The brand...
...that everyone is talking about.
Who is "everyone"?
We do already have
a sports franchise.
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.
MLS? Which team?
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.
It's my son's team.
Anyway, we can save the world.
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.
What do you say?
Are you a crackpot?
Hey, hon. You're probably
at the store. I am on my way.
I think I made a connection.
Not really.
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and I... Damn it.
And I want some meatballs, okay?
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?
Idiot.
Hey.
Hey. Hey!
Move it. There's a train coming.
Do you not hear that horn?
Let's go! I got a train!
Move it!
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!
Son of a bitch!
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.
Get out!
Get off the track! Move!
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?
Please, that guy's still in there.
You sure?
Get him out of there!
Will you look at that?
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.
All of you people...
...blocking the intersection...
...you're all idiots.
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.
You're an asshole.
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.
Some superhero you are! Fly off!
Shut up!
Don't you understand? I'm alive.
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...
No. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.
Thank you, Hancock.
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?
Throw the ball!
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.
Great. Thank you.
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?
I want you to meet somebody.
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.
- Who's this?
- Hancock.
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.
You would not have believed it.
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.
Saw my whole life
flash before my eyes.
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.
Hang on a... One second.
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.
- You like meatballs?
- No.
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...
I love meatballs.
Who's so busy
they can't have a meal?
And it's on us. Please.
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?
Do you like eagles?
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?
No? All right.
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...
- Ever.
- Yeah.
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.
Aaron.
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?
No. His name is Aaron.
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?
Never let them punk you.
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.
You don't have to do that,
honey, okay? Seriously.
It's a good idea.
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.
Okay, please, just stop.
Michel is not a man, okay?
He's a little boy. And his parents...
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.
Maybe you don't know this...
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.
...scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.
She watches so much news...
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.
Are...?
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?
Do you want him to kill us all?
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...
He got it. She didn't get it.
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.
We change the way people see
products, companies...
...people, that stuff.
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.
But hear me out.
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.
You know, you're a superhero.
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.
People should cheer you
on the streets.
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?
No, no, they're not... It's all right.
They're not pricks,
they're just people.
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?
That's all I ask. Okay?
You use...
Put it under here?
Put it right there. Perfect.
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.
I want you to think about it.
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?
You get back to me?
I'll be right here. All right.
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.
What about AllHeart?
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.
You really hate him.
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?
You see the good in everybody, Ray.
Even sometimes when it's not there.
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.
My bad. Everybody all right?
I'll go and get my mommy.
He is an asshole.
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.
- You know who I am?
- My papa says you are an asshole.
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?
- Asshole?
- Yeah.
Because that could make someone
very angry...
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.
You behave like an asshole.
All right...
Do you know Aaron?
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.
Why, asshole?
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.
Call me a asshole...
...one more time.
Asshole.
How about you, thickness?
Goggles?
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?
I'll meet you in the house.
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.
I live here.
I know what the street's like.
We'll make those problems
of the past.
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.
What is this?
That's me trying to change the world.
Unfortunately, not doing real well.
Come on. Let's get to you.
This stuff was on YouTube.
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.
Mom! Mom! Mom!
Those are children.
- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face.
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.
Along comes Hancock.
Hancock!
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.
Greenpeace does. Walter does.
This gets redundant after a while...
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.
You're an asshole.
I know. I call it like I see it though.
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?
Be careful.
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...
...when you see this?
Homo.
- What about that?
- Homo in red.
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...
- Almost.
- And then he kicked it in.
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.
Hey, sweetheart.
Have you been watching the news?
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.
The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.
Felony destruction of property...
...amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.
From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...
...with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.
You are not above the law.
You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.
Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.
You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.
Bank on it, buddy.
We do not condone the t...
Genius.
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.
When they do, we'll be ready.
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.
What do you got to lose?
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.
My behavior has been improper,
and I accept the consequences.
I ask my fellow Angelenos...
...for their patience
and understanding."
You're an asshole, Hancock!
Asshole!
"Life here can be difficult for me.
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.
During my incarceration,
I will be participating...
...in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment. "
You're a drunk bum!
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."
All right.
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to your new home...
It is the duty of each of you...
...to remember
your inmate serial number.
Turn to your right.
Turn to your left.
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.
Give me the hand, playboy.
I see you, punk!
Oh, I get it.
I put some... Most of you in here.
Yes, you did.
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.
What?
So I'm gonna do me
and I'm gonna let you do you.
I don't want no trouble.
All right?
I just wanna go to my cell.
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.
Deadly.
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?
Choo, choo, asshole.
Get him out! Get him out!
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.
It's a big number, but not something
we didn't anticipate.
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey!
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...
...the DA and the cops...
...they're all gonna call
for your immediate release.
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.
- Hancock!
- Get back!
You're being a coward!
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.
How we gonna do that, Ray?
All right, guys, let's start sharing.
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.
Good for you.
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...
...and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.
Why do you always laugh?
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.
No, no, no.
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?
Pass.
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.
And don't land on
a $ 100,000 Mercedes. All right?
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.
Mr. Hancock, your share.
Pass.
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...
...so tell him he's done a good job.
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?
Oh, man!
KBLA radio, AM 850.
Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?
I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.
I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.
Let my cousin Pookie out.
"I see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.
I respect your courage...
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."
This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon
around it, but he gets the job done.
Besides, he's hot.
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."
G...
Goo...
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?
- Pass.
- Good.
Good.
Good j...
Good j...
Good job.
Good job.
Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.
Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.
The L.A.P.D. Is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...
...in the last five days
that Hancock has been behind bars.
- Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
- Hey, little buddy.
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.
Hey, what's up, Hancock?
Where's...? Where's Ray?
No, it's just us. Ray's working.
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...
- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.
Ray is a good man.
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.
Okay?
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.
Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one,
and I want you to have it.
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks, Mom.
Come here.
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?
Pass.
All right. Phillip?
I love you guys, man.
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.
For when they call.
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.
Actually, I'm not, Ray.
You think you're not, but you are.
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.
Asshole!
You're still a fake-ass punk.
Damn!
Mr. Hancock?
It's your share.
Pass.
- Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
- Come on, John.
I don't have nothing.
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- Do it.
First time for everything.
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.
All right. Thanks for sharing.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- All right.
- That's awesome.
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.
Hey, Hancock.
Come on, get up.
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.
It's the chief of police.
He says he needs your help.
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...
...who was killed last year in Iraq...
...leaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...
...but apparently
there are three suspects and...
What's going on?
I'm out!
Stay down! Stay down!
Stay down!
- Get out!
- Get down!
Get it down!
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!
Back! Move!
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.
The west side is open.
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.
What?
It's a little tight. What you got?
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.
Good job.
Good job.
Really, good job.
Get down!
It's Hancock!
Take him out!
Good job!
Do I have permission
to touch your body?
Yes!
It's not sexual.
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the fuck out of here!
He's on the move!
He's moving, he's moving!
Good job.
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!
- Hancock!
- Good job.
You said that.
I need you to end this now.
Check the flanks.
Secure the perimeter.
Spread out!
They're gonna
come around the back.
What happened to him?
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?
What is happening?
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.
Do you know what this is?
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.
If my thumb comes off it:
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...
...between the police showing up...
...and you sucking out
all of my associates...
...I want you to break into the vault.
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.
Thirty million dollars.
And you're gonna carry it for me.
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.
I'm gonna have to say no to that.
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.
I really don't like that word.
I will blow them sky-high...
...and their blood
will be on your hands.
Do you hear me, asshole?
Call me a asshole...
...one more time.
Ass...
- Go, go, go. Move in!
- Go on, you're safe!
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Take it right in. Let's go.
Bring it around now.
Keep your hand on that trigger.
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.
- Thank you.
- Good job.
Hancock!
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.
Here we go. This way.
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.
Smile.
Good job, Hancock!
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody
in here, huh?
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.
Gigantic fans. Insane!
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.
You never call, man.
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.
Could you guys
get used to this or what?
How'd you two meet?
I was married once before.
First wife...
...she died giving birth to Aaron.
It's another dinner. But... But...
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.
I don't know what the hell to do.
And I was in the supermarket...
...and I'm in the baby aisle...
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.
An angel...
...sees me.
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...
...was throwing me a little rope.
You know?
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.
What about you, buddy?
You're from another planet,
aren't you?
No, man, I'm from Miami.
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...
...and it just broke against my skin.
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.
The doctors were astounded...
...and they wanted to know my story.
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.
Amnesia.
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.
- You don't remember anything?
- No.
Only thing I had in my pocket was...
...bubble gum...
...two movie tickets.
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.
But no ID, nothing.
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.
I actually thought that's who I was.
How come I didn't hear any of this...
...didn't read about it
in any newspapers?
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.
Eighty years ago?
Oh, I don't age. This is it.
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:
What kind of bastard
must I have been...
...that nobody was there to claim me?
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...
...so I've been told, but...
...nobody?
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.
Hey.
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?
Yeah. Too much wine.
I am a lightweight.
I'm sorry.
You ain't do nothing.
This was a nice dinner, Ray.
- It was a good one.
- Almost call this fun.
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.
Could've just flown me upstairs.
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.
I got something to say to you.
Listen to me. This is important.
You are like a Dodger Dog.
It's something people don't think
they're gonna like...
...then they try it and they love it,
right? It hits the spot.
It's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.
I don't know.
But you know what I mean, right?
You're gonna do great.
You're gonna fix everything.
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.
Hancock tucking me in.
All right, he's asleep.
- Okay, thanks. Good night.
- Good night.
Look, I just don't want you
to think that... That Ray...
...you know, drinks like that,
because...
- Oh, no.
- This was just kind of...
...a celebratory night.
- No, I understand.
- Yeah, I know that.
- Okay.
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.
You have a bruise on your hand.
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what that is.
I've been feeling kind of funny.
You...
You should go.
Getting late.
If Ray finds out about me...
...you're dead.
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.
Hi, honey.
Breakfast?
Hancock sneezed, huh?
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?
I just said him being around...
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.
But you don't worry about anything.
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.
Everything is taken care of.
You just...
...enjoy that breakfast.
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?
Just the three of us.
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.
- Tonight?
- Spur of the moment.
- Tonight might be a little tough.
- Come on. The three of us?
Me in a bikini?
- Sounds good.
- Let's go somewhere.
Knock, knock.
Gesundheit.
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...
...because I don't think
our house could take much more...
...of your sneezing.
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...
...or if I get really surprised.
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.
Mike? How you doing?
It was great to see you too.
Yep. Well...
Right. Go ahead, shoot.
Okay. I got a pen right here.
Right. No, I know.
It's right here in my hand.
I am warning you.
All right, go ahead.
Okay, good.
Now... And that's still in 310, right?
Hang on one second.
Do me a favor...?
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.
We're gonna talk.
Go away.
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.
L... I suppose...
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.
And when we're done talking...
...you go away
and you leave my family alone.
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.
Yeah, 3:30. Great.
Hon, is it hot in here?
He hurt you, didn't he?
Come on, use your words.
How did it make you feel?
Sore.
Bad.
Bad.
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.
You understand me?
We're gonna go find Hancock...
...and get your power back.
Well, I'm here.
Yup.
- You wanna do it?
- Do what?
I don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...
...I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.
I ain't leaving L.A.
All right, all right. Jeez.
Don't.
Ask.
- You and I.
- "You and I" what?
- We're the same.
- No.
I'm stronger.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
Who are we?
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."
- Are there more of us?
- There were.
They all died.
It's just the two of us.
What is this?
Who are we to each other?
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.
You're lying, deal's off.
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.
Get your ass back here!
I'm telling!
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...
...as a symbol...
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.
You stay away
from me and my family.
You are not gonna
do this to me again.
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?
I don't know
what you're talking about!
Finally, I am happy!
You are not gonna mess with that!
I don't know
what you're talking about!
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.
Call me crazy...
...one more time.
Cuckoo.
All right, hold it. All right.
You better not hit me with that truck.
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.
They're committed
to bettering the world.
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.
I've mocked up
these examples here...
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.
Oh, no.
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...
Is it snowing?
Stop. Stop it.
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just...
Get off me!
Get off me!
Stop. Stop!
Get off!
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.
Oh, my God.
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.
And I'm very strong as well.
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.
Technically speaking...
...he's my husband.
Holy shit.
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.
But you can, right? You knew?
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.
Whatever we are,
we were built in twos, okay?
We're drawn to each other.
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.
He finds me. It's physics.
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.
And the one thing I learned...
...fate doesn't decide everything.
People get to choose.
And you chose...
...to let me think I was here alone.
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.
Great. Now what?
I didn't plan for this.
Prison authorities confirmed...
...that the prisoner uprising was led
by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...
...who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.
More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.
Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.
The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...
...and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.
Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.
He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...
...to organize criminals
from different backgrounds.
He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.
While there, he organized
a notorious criminal network...
...comprised of graduate students
from diverse...
Ninety-one ten.
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.
Ninety-one ten.
Highway robbery.
- What?
- I'm taking the money.
I can relate to that.
You know? If you want something...
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...
...you just take it, right?
I like that.
But can you take it?
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.
Sorry about your window.
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!
I need Room 1020.
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...
Where's his IV line?
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.
What's happening?
This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...
...to Los Angeles General Hospital.
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.
No story yet as to
how this happened to him...
...but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A....
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!
Just a couple of questions,
sir, please.
Can you describe how it happened?
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?
Not that I'm aware of.
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?
Here are the lab results for 209.
You're becoming mortal.
It's us...
...being close to each other.
It's never happened this fast before.
You have to leave.
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.
You'll start getting
your powers back...
...and be flying and breaking things...
...and saving people
before you know it.
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.
Love, connect...
...grow old, die.
What happened to us?
Summer of 4 B.C.
We were becoming mortal, like now.
They came after me with swords.
But you saved me.
1850.
They set our house on fire.
You pulled me out of the flames.
Eighty years ago.
What happened then?
We were living in Miami...
...and a new movie
was playing in town.
Frankenstein.
And after...
...we walked down Flagler Street...
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.
And they attacked us in an alley.
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.
But you didn't know me.
So I left.
Every time we're together...
...they come after you through me.
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.
That's who you are. You're a hero.
The insurance policy of the gods.
Keep one alive. You.
To protect this world.
Mary!
Mom!
- Mary!
- Stay down!
Okay.
Mary?
Stop.
Oh, no! No! Please!
Stay down.
Hey! Mary!
Let's go, get her up!
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!
Hold her down. Hold her down.
Hold her down.
Hold her down.
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.
Upon us all, Hancock.
You're no different.
Time to shut her down, Hancock.
It's been a nice run.
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.
But it is time for you to move on.
And maybe to a happier place.
You can thank me if you want to...
...superhero.
You didn't!
Aaron!
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?
- Needy.
- J.F.K.? What about him?
Oh, yeah.
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.
Yeah, hang on.
- Hello?
- Ray.
Hey, I've been trying to call you.
Yeah, I was out of cell range.
- Are you outside?
- Yeah.
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.
I'm looking up.
- Baby?
- What?
You're gonna change the world.
- Good job, Ray.
- Oh, my God, Ray.
Hey. Look up.
Hancock.
I'm proud of you.
Thanks.
Will I get in trouble for that?
- Freeze!
- Don't move!
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!
Get back! Get back! Get back!
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!
Get back! I'm not playing.
Get back. Get back!
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.
Now let's make it happen, asshole.
