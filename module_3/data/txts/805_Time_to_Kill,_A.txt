Yeah!
Go, buddy, go!
That baby's going scared.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Hell, yeah!
Excited, yeah?
Go, baby!
Yeah!
I don't wanna do nothing...
We got her, bro.
Here we go.
Give me one.
Get them, get them, get them.
Hey, boys!
How y'all doing today?
What are you looking at?
You wanna get shot?
You wanna get shot?
Woo-hoo!
Go, baby!
Got it!
Pearl Harbor! Pearl Harbor!
Hey!
And here's another one.
Watch this, Billy Ray!
Hundred points!
Yeah!
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Bye, Tonya.
Bye.
Clean up that mess, boy.
Pete, hungry?
Huh?
Hey.
Oh, you're not having anything?
Yeah, I'm having them.
Course, it's shit.
Bye, girls.
Bye, Daddy.
Let's go, Max.
Get in the house, pup.
Harry Rex.
All those weekends, fishing,
drinking, lounging...
opportunities lost to "do it
yourself" house renovations.
Tragic, just tragic, Jake.
Yeah.
Makes Carla happy, my man.
Spent four marriages trying to
figure out what makes women happy.
You have spent four marriages...
trying to figure out what makes
you happy, who you kidding?
Oh, yeah.
Maybe that's it.
Yeah, maybe.
Swiggy?
Lord, please let my car be...
fixed today.
Oh, dear.
Hey, who's that?
She looks a little young.
Hold this.
What are you gonna do?
You know what I always say, if
they're old enough to crawl...
they're in the right position.
What are you gonna do?
You crazy.
Whoo! Yeah!
Fifty points!
Yeah, you good, boy.
Shut up!
Daddy!
Hey!
Shut up.
Daddy!
Shut up.
I'll kill you.
My turn.
Daddy!
Shut up.
Daddy.
Yeah.
Mom!
Mama!
Mom!
Mama!
Mom!
Mama!
Mom.
What is this?
Groceries.
Y'all didn't see her?
No, ma'am.
Carl Lee!
Stop!
You got a call from your wife!
What? What?
How many appointments do we
have today, Ethel?
Not a one.
But it is the 1st of the month
again, and guess what?
The checks are pouring in, and
we have enough money...
to pay all our past debts, and
then some.
That'll be your last drink.
Just keep us no more than one
month behind...
on any vendor, please.
Why, you have been drinking.
Two months.
Well, these are the most
delinquent.
The rent is in there.
I appreciate the practice,
captain Connor, I do...
but you could've left me
a couple of clients.
Baby, here's Daddy.
Oh, no.
I'm here, baby.
Daddy's here.
Daddy, I'm sorry I dropped
the groceries.
That's all right, baby.
I'm sorry, Daddy.
It's all right, baby.
That's all right.
Look at this.
Billy Ray?
Sorry, sir, but we don't allow
no African-Americans in here.
Billy Ray Cobb, you and Mr. Willard
need to come with me.
Hell, no.
I ain't moving.
You know that little girl you
took for a ride?
What little girl?
I got bad news for you, Billy Ray.
She didn't die.
So, unless there's another
redneck asshole...
got a souped-up yellow pickup...
with a Confederate flag in the
windshield...
Hey, blue gums, why don't you take
your cold black ass out of here...
and grab a branch.
Unless you got an explanation...
for what this was doing in the
bed of your truck...
you're going to jail.
Now, get up.
You can go to hell, nigger.
Goddamn!
Hey!
Now, you earned the right to
remain silent.
Here you go baby, just the way
you like them.
Thank you.
Adell, sugar, today I'm gonna have...
Go to hell, Harry.
On a second thought, today I'm
just gonna watch "baby" eat his.
I am not the one who handled
her ex-husband's divorce.
Can't she see I'm shriveling
away, here?
I'm shriveling.
Say, Jake?
Yeah, what's up, Dwayne?
Didn't you defend Billy Ray Cobb,
few years back?
What kind of case was it?
Caught him selling dope.
Spent time in Parchman.
Got out last year.
No, I think some Memphis lawyer
handled that.
Why d'you ask?
Well, we picked him up for rape.
Him and Pete Willard.
Who'd they rape?
You know Carl Lee Hailey?
Sure, I defended his brother,
Lester.
It was his little girl.
Little Tonya?
Yeah.
How old is she?
She's ten.
Mr. Willard, I'm Sheriff Ozzie
Walls.
My mama voted for you.
I've seen you play for the Rams.
Way I figure, a nigger sheriff's
okay, been on TV and all.
No offense.
What's your full name?
James Lewis Willard.
Four, which is a difference
of 110.60.
Who's there?
Carl Lee.
How is she?
She holding on.
Doctor says she ain't out of
the woods yet, though.
They worked her over something
good, Jake.
You remember them four white boys
raped that little black girl...
in the Delta, last year?
Yeah.
They, uh...
They got off, didn't they?
Yeah.
Jake...
I was in a jam, you'd help me
out, wouldn't you?
Sure, Carl Lee.
What kind of jam you talking
about?
You got a daughter, Jake.
What would you do?
Dream some good dreams, baby
girl.
Good night, Daddy.
Night, baby.
Is she asleep?
Yeah.
Is she the sweetest thing?
Yeah, she is.
Next to you.
Tell you what, I look at her,
though...
and I cannot help but think
about little Tonya.
Don't.
Don't do that to yourself.
Yeah.
Something else wrong?
Tonya's father...
Carl Lee Hailey...
came by the office today.
Man's heart is torn wide open,
baby.
I don't know, but...
sounded to me like he was
thinking about doing something.
Like what?
Something like maybe killing
those two boys.
Was he serious?
I don't know.
I don't know.
It could've been just the hurt
talking, you know?
But when you think that it's
possible...
that those two animals could...
go free...
and be walking the streets...
I...
I don't know.
Jake, honey, after what that
man has been through...
he's probably capable of
anything.
Somebody should do something.
You should call Sheriff Walls.
Yeah.
To release the owner from
assessment.
I hope I'm having a heart attack
because then I'd get to sue you.
Don't stand on ceremony, come
on in.
What?
No clients?
Just waiting to pick yours up
on appeal, Harry.
And you, are you on vacation?
Fortunately for me, my lovely...
divorce doesn't go on vacation.
However...
not even the richest, most
ridiculous settlement...
I ever bring in...
is gonna be as satisfying as
watching those two hyenas...
across the street get what's
coming to them.
Oh, dear.
You know I'm a fool for those,
um, German-type convertibles.
Come on, lover boy, let's get
to court.
Lucien thinks the two hyenas
just might get off.
You saw Lucien?
When?
Where?
How is he?
Has he been eating any better?
Just curious.
Um, Miss Ethel...
refresh my recollection...
how long were you and Lucien
together for, exactly?
We were never together.
I was his secretary for twenty
years.
Come on, old girl.
You can tell us, you know.
He was your boyfriend.
I am an upstanding, God-fearing,
respectable Southern woman...
with unimpeachable morals...
who has been happily married
for twenty-seven years.
And I have never had, or ever
will have any boyfriend.
And if I did...
it certainly would not be that
old pickled scoundrel...
Lucien Wilbanks!
She did him.
Oh, yeah, a lot.
All right Billy Ray, step on
back.
Come on out.
Willard.
All right, boys, today's your
big day.
We're gonna take a trip to the
courthouse.
The judge is gonna set your bail.
Then we're gonna come back here,
all nice and peaceful-like.
I get any trouble out of you, I'm
going to integrate this jail.
Mama, Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!
Hannah girl, let's go inside
for a minute.
Give Daddy some time to himself.
Let's... let's find a book, okay?
I wanna see Daddy.
Honey?
Jake? Jake? Are you hurt?
Jake, what happened to you?
Jake, honey, are you okay?
What happened to you?
What is this? What is going
on with you? What happened?
Jake, baby.
What happened?
Okay, okay.
See you, Gwen.
Is the sheriff gonna make
a statement?
He might, he might not.
I don't know.
Is it first-degree murder?
I'm not sure yet.
What happened?
Can you tell us something?
Sheriff, will you give us a
statement?
I got no comment.
No comment, no comment.
Hey. Hey, Jake. Hey, Jake,
Carl Lee said you'd be coming.
Sir, are you an attorney?
Are you an attorney?
Alright, now, I'll make you a
statement.
I want y'all to get these vans
out of here.
Sir, we've gotta get something
for our newscast.
Didn't think I'd do it, did you?
How you holding up?
I ain't had nothing against
them boys...
till they messed my baby.
And I feel sorry for their mamas
and their daddies, but...
I ain't sorry for what I done.
How's Looney?
You blew his knee right off
his leg.
Doctors are still with him.
What's gonna happen to me now?
There's gonna be a preliminary
hearing.
Probably tomorrow.
After that, Buckley will push
for a fast trial.
Who's Buckley?
Rufus Buckley.
District attorney.
He's mean, he's ambitious...
and he's gonna eat this up
because of the publicity.
But you've done beat him,
ain't you?
Yeah.
Not in a murder case.
Think I can win?
All depends on the jury,
Carl Lee.
Pick the right jury, and you
walk.
D.A. picks the jury...
and you get the gas.
Well, how much...
how much a case like this cost?
Probably fifty grand.
I can pay maybe ten.
Well, not a lot of white lawyers
would've took my brother...
Lester's case.
You did, and got him off.
I figure there's a lot of people
out there...
tired of all the raping and
killing.
They'd be sympathetic to a
man...
who took the law into his own
hands, even if he is black.
You said you'd help me out
if I was in a jam, Jake.
Well, I'm in one now.
What you say?
What can you tell us, sheriff?
Can you tell us what happened?
Are you with the police department?
No, I am a lawyer.
Are you Carl Lee Hailey's
attorney?
Sir, are you Mr. Hailey's
attorney?
Yes, I am.
What's your name, sir?
Brigance. Jake Brigance.
That's with one G.
Hailey's hired an attorney.
Jake Brigance.
And today ain't even my birthday.
Brigance couldn't tie his own tie
without that old drunk Wilbanks.
Well, he's telling the press he
never lost a murder case.
Well, he's never tried one
against me, has he?
What time is the preliminary?
Tomorrow at 3.
Judge Omar Noose, presiding.
Oh, I was wrong.
It is my birthday.
Alright.
First things first, Brigance
will file for a change of venue.
Guy would be a fool, if he didn't.
Why's that?
Why?
Should we tell our young,
uninformed law clerk...
the reality of jurisprudence
in this county?
Evelyn, get me the state file
on race statistics.
You see, Taylor, it's quite
simple.
This county's twenty six, thirty
percent black, give or take.
Almost every other county is
forty, forty-five...
in some cases seventy percent
black.
Blacks are more sympathetic to
other blacks.
If he gets it moved, he has
a greater chance of color...
in the jury box, and we know
what that means.
But if the trial stays here,
it's an all-white jury for sure.
Now, Taylor, this is for you...
to integrate your brain with,
before 3:00 tomorrow.
Yes.
He means without blacks on
the jury...
Hailey hasn't got a chance in
hell.
All right, Noose is up for re-elect?
Yeah, November.
Good. Reach out to our friends
in the legislature.
Have them call on judge Noose.
We're just gonna help him decide
to keep this case in Canton.
Also, send a case of whatever
it is he's drinking these days...
to Lucien Wilbanks.
I believe that's Dewars.
Keep that old drunk on the sidelines.
Yeah, get me Sam.
And, gentlemen?
No mistakes. This is the one
we've been waiting for.
Justifiable homicide will never
hold up.
Then my only chance is to find
a shrink who'll testify...
Carl Lee was insane at the time
of the murders.
Well, I might know a man who
owes me a favor.
You'll file for change of venue.
Of course.
Judge Noose denies it...
then you'll get an all-white
jury and you'll lose.
Thank you for the encouragement.
Well, bear in mind that Mr. Hailey
is as guilty as sin...
under our legal system.
It does not permit vigilante
violence, and he took the law...
into his own hands.
He murdered two people.
Two people who had raped his
ten-year-old daughter.
You know...
you can win this case...
and justice will prevail.
But lose...
and justice will also prevail.
Now, that's a strange case.
Yeah.
I could use your help.
The sons of bitches decertified
me, Jake.
I swore I will never enter
another courtroom ever.
Lucien, you're the best lawyer
I've ever seen.
Now, I know how much it hurt when
they took your license away...
but they can't take your mind,
unless you let them.
Good speech.
Well, I had a good teacher.
Now, you remember when I came
to you out of law school?
In a ridiculous blue suit.
Yeah.
Now, you sat me down and you
said to me:
"Young man, I cannot promise
you riches.
What I can offer you is a chance
to save the world...
one case at a time."
Well, I'm saying the same words
back to you, right now.
How about it, Lucien?
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures.
He leadeth me beside still
waters.
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...
I will fear no evil, for thou
art with me.
Thy rod and thy staff comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me...
Sure am sorry about your brother,
Freddie.
Old Willard too.
Good boys, both.
Ten years ago, that nigger would
be hanging by the end of a rope...
with his balls in his mouth.
You tell me what's wrong
with this country.
Klan would know what to do.
My granddaddy, he was Klan.
Ain't no Klan around here, for
years.
Oh, there's still some boys,
around.
Well, you mean them skinheads?
Who want to blow up the government?
No, sir.
Good, God-fearing Klan.
I got a friend, used to be
active.
I could give him a call.
You do that, Winston.
You tell them boys we need some
Klan down here, in Canton.
I mean, right quick.
Hurry up, honey.
Coming, coming, coming.
Something you can tell us?
What did Carl Lee tell you?
There's Ozzie.
To our family's television debut.
To the big time.
I cannot believe you didn't
take it seriously...
when I warned you Carl Lee might
do some damage.
Well, baby, you know, some folks
think those boys...
got what they deserved.
Here, sweet pea.
Carl Lee Hailey may very well
spend...
the rest of his life in prison.
That is nothing his family
deserves.
Yeah.
You did call Ozzie...
Lookit here. Look who's...
Daddy's on TV.
I intend to show that the good
men and women of the South...
will look past color and see
the truth.
That here, in the South... in
the new South...
justice is, and will be,
colorblind.
Impressive.
Honey, that was really good.
Isn't Daddy smart?
Yeah.
Brigance.
Mm-hm.
That was great.
Yeah.
No, we just saw it.
All right, Harry Rex.
Yeah.
Baby, I'm proud of you.
Good stuff, huh?
Mm-hm.
You hear this?
Put it on speakerphone.
Don't be gross.
Ahem. F. Lee Bailey's office.
Brigance.
You nigger-loving son-of-a-bitch,
you won't live if the nigger walks.
Hey, hey.
Hey!
Do you have any sympathy for
the defense?
Well, of course I do, Stephanie.
You're a mother, I'm a father.
We all have families.
Who wouldn't?
Don't presume the district
attorney is insensitive.
But the people of the state
of Mississippi...
entrusted this office to uphold
the law of the land.
Our society cannot condone
men...
who take the law into their own
hands...
no matter what the circumstance.
If you get a conviction, will
you ask for the gas chamber?
Yes, I will seek the death penalty
for Mr. Hailey.
What do you think of Mr. Brigance?
Isn't that boy still in law
school?
Say hey to your husband for
me, Kim. That's all.
Hey, Cora Mae, don't you worry.
Hey, Wayne, how are you?
Good luck.
You plead him guilty today, I'll
ask for life. Otherwise, he dies.
You drop your case now...
and I won't bury you before
the entire county, Rufus.
All rise.
Court is in session. The Honorable
Omar Noose presiding.
Good afternoon, citizens.
Be seated.
Counsel.
And you, sir.
Are you Carl Lee Hailey?
Yes, sir.
Uh, Mr. Hailey, I am holding a
copy of an indictment returned...
by the grand jury of Mississippi,
presenting that:
"Carl Lee Hailey did murder
Billy Ray Cobb, a human being...
and James Lewis Willard, a human
being...
and did attempt to kill Dwayne
Looney, a peace officer...
against the peace and dignity
of the state of Mississippi."
Now, do you understand the
charges against you?
Yes, sir.
How do you wish to plead?
Not guilty, Your Honor.
The defense enters a plea of
not guilty...
by reason of insanity, Your
Honor.
Your trial is set for July 22.
All pre-trial motions and
matters...
should be filed no later than
July 8.
Is there anything further?
Yes.
Your Honor, in response to the
insanity plea...
the state requests the defendant
be examined by its own doctors.
Request granted.
Additionally, the state opposes
any request for bail.
Your Honor, we haven't yet
asked for bail.
Now, Governor Buckley cannot
oppose a request...
until one is made. He should've
learned that in law school.
Your Honor, even Mr. Brigance's
meager legal experience...
should've taught him two things.
Number one, I have not been
elected governor, yet.
And number two, he is required
to request bail.
The state opposes any such
request.
In the future...
why don't we just wait till he
makes the request, huh?
Thank you, Your Honor.
Your Honor, we would like to
request bail.
Denied.
Now, I have never allowed bail
in a capital-murder case...
and don't feel that an exception
is called for, today.
Good enough.
Your owner, we will be filing
for a change of venue.
Now, I anticipated this.
Let me save you some time,
Mr. Brigance.
Your motion is denied.
If it pleases the court, your
Honor, we have not yet filed.
We are simply indicating our
intent to file...
in writing, by letting you...
I said, request denied.
Your Honor...
how can you summarily deny
this request?
It is quite clear that Carl Lee
Hailey cannot receive...
a fair trial here in Canton.
Now, we feel...
That's enough. Sidebar.
Your Honor, we have a right...
Mr. Brigance...
I will not tolerate grand-standing
in my courtroom.
Get back to work.
Excellent technique, counselor.
Your Honor.
We feel it would be remiss not to
tell you that in State vs Johnson...
and State vs Fisher...
both in 1985...
failure to properly consider
a change of venue...
has been a reversible decision on
appeal to the state supreme court.
No... no trial judge likes his
rulings overturned.
I guess you get to submit that
brief, after all.
Have it on my desk by Tuesday
morning.
Uh, Mr. Hailey, you are hereby
ordered...
to remain in custody of the
Madison County sheriff...
until trial.
Dismissed.
Find me that doctor, that state
doctor.
What's his name, Rodeheaver?
Get him down here, to interview
Hailey.
Since he's not gonna be able to
afford a real one...
I wanna find who Brigance is
using for a shrink.
I want him discredited.
You want professional conduct,
or personal dirt?
I don't wanna know how you
do it.
Just get me enough to shatter
him in court.
We can do that.
Taylor?
This is $900, Carl Lee.
We said a thousand down.
My kids gotta eat.
Mine too, man.
All right, when do I get the
rest?
Them folks over at the bank...
they won't loan me no money
on my house.
Why not? Your house is almost
paid for.
You borrowed on it before,
for Lester's trial.
Said I wasn't in jail, before.
Said to Gwen, how am I gonna
pay sitting on death row?
And, I lost my job at the mill.
They called Gwen.
Worked twenty years, I'm out
five days and they fired me.
Carl Lee, I can't trial a
capital-murder case for $900.
Carl Lee, I need to live.
Me too, Jake.
I need to live, too.
Nice night.
Finder of precedents, mystery
woman of the courthouse.
Yup.
Care for a beer?
I assume that's the infamous
"Change of Venue" motion...
under your arm.
Mm-hm.
Ellen Roark.
R-O-A-R-K.
That's Roark in Boston, but it
seems to be Roark in Mississippi.
Boston, huh?
Yup, I was born there.
My father's the notorious
Sheldon Roark.
"Attorney to the Stars", yes.
Duly impressed.
What brings you to Mississippi,
Roark? Slumming?
No, law school at Ole Miss.
It's a... it's a family tradition.
Mom was a sweet little sorority
girl there...
till Dad... till Dad married her.
I married a sweet little sorority
girl from Ole Miss, myself.
Well, they have an excellent
selection.
Yes, they do.
Now, really, what brings you
to Canton?
I'm not believing they don't
have cars to sit on, on campus.
Carl Lee Hailey.
Really like to help you with
the trial.
Now, what makes you think
I need help?
You're trying one of the largest
murder cases...
these parts have seen and you
work alone.
You have no paralegals, no
clerks, researchers...
nor can you afford to hire any...
so, if Noose doesn't accept
that motion under your arm...
you go to trial in less than a
month. Trust me, you need help.
Now, how do you know this?
Well, I'm an excellent researcher.
I see that.
Look, I've played gofer...
for seven capital-murder cases,
I've witnessed 2 executions...
I have written briefs for the ACLU,
I'm top 5 percent of my class...
editor of the law review, I'm
published, I'm young.
And when I graduate...
I intend to spend a glorious
career...
stomping out the death penalty.
Um...
Let's see, what else? Oh,
genius runs in my family.
So, see, you'll be getting me
on the way up...
and I really think, you know, now
is a good time to, you know...
grab me.
Mm-hm. Is there anything else
I should know?
Uh, let's see, anything else?
Oh, my father's filthy rich, so
I'll be working for free.
What do you think?
I think I'll drop this brief
off in Noose's night slot.
Go home and see my family.
Thank you, Roark, but I can
handle the case myself.
Uh...
you might wanna look at these
precedents.
Look at State vs Cooper and
State vs Roundtree.
They are both revenge killers,
both acquitted.
You'll change your mind.
See you.
Get out.
Come on.
Wait.
Come on.
Mr. Cobb, this is Stump Sisson,
"Grand Dragon" of Mississippi.
He heard you were looking to
see us.
You were right to call us,
Mr. Cobb.
They say the Klan is dead.
Klan don't show up for a few
years...
and people say the Klan is
dead.
Fact is, it just looks dead.
The Klan has always been
right there...
under the surface.
Just waiting for the opportunity
to deliver God's justice.
I wanna help.
I wanna kill that nigger.
Niggers got plenty of protection,
nowadays.
They got the NAACP, and the ACLU.
Even the federal government.
Hell.
White folks ain't got a chance.
Except the Klan.
I'm gonna tell you what.
You get five or six of your
friends of similar thinking...
and we'll initiate the Madison
County Klavern.
Even make you leader.
Now, you tell me...
who's that nigger's lawyer?
Local boy.
His name's Brigance. He's got
a pretty good reputation.
He got family?
Yes, sir. He... he has a wife
and a daughter.
Good.
Two, two.
What the hell is he doing here?
Now, calm down.
No.
Come on, calm down.
Calm down.
He has no right, after what he did.
No, he's got no right, sheriff.
Don't get your mom upset, now.
Looney?
Dwayne?
I made Ozzie bring me.
Shit, Dwayne, we...
We known each other since we
was kids.
It's my fault.
No matter what gets said in
court...
I knew what I was doing, and I
sure didn't intend to hurt you...
but just them two boys.
I know it don't mean much now,
but...
I'm sorry.
Some folks think that a black
man cannot receive a fair trial...
in the South.
I intend to show that the good
men and women of the South...
will look past color, and see
the truth.
It sure is a nigger's world.
Not for long.
Boys, I am very proud to invite
you to become soldiers...
in the war to protect our
Christian homes and families.
To resurrect our country from the
fires of racial degradation.
And to make white people the sole
masters of our nation's destiny.
What I'm saying, fellas...
it's time for the nigger to pay.
Something wrong with your telephone?
No, we just had the number changed.
That's what the operator said.
To an unlisted number.
Yeah.
I'm sorry you had to come all
the way up here.
I should've called you, but
this case...
This case has us all worried
sick about you all, Jake.
And you know this thing could
get ugly. And dangerous.
Jake, he shot them in cold blood.
They raped and almost murdered
his daughter, Sarah.
What if the same thing happened
to Hannah?
Brigance! Mr. Brigance!
Mr. Brigance!
May we ask a few questions?
Can we get a quote?
Mr. Brigance.
Excuse me a second.
I'm going to go take a few
questions.
Jake, honey, this isn't the time.
This is really good for Carl Lee.
I'll be right back.
Thank y'all for coming.
I guess we'll have to read about
it in the papers.
Praise Jesus!
Reverend Agee?
Yes.
I'm Isaiah Street.
Well, it's an honor to meet
you, Reverend.
I saw you march with Dr. King.
Yeah, well...
the struggle continues today,
here in Canton.
Carl Lee Hailey's on trial
because he's black.
No other reason.
These people are with the NAACP.
Oh?
Reverend Agee.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Reverend Agee, the black
community's concerned that...
Mr. Hailey's attorney is...
not sensitive to the needs
of the movement.
The NAACP wishes to provide him
with a new lawyer.
We need to raise funds to
support Carl Lee Hailey.
I don't know, Reverend.
Time's awfully tight here.
Obviously, we would expect you
to take...
a modest administration fee
for your troubles.
Your loyalty has been forged
in a baptism of fire.
Rise, knights of the Ku Klux
Klan...
and let your brethren never
regret...
they believed you worthy of
fellowship.
Welcome to the Klan.
I need to talk to Jake Brigance.
He's not in.
May I ask who's calling?
Uh, well...
Mickey Mouse.
Who?
Mickey Mouse.
Get out, right now.
Who is this?
Get your daughter out of the
house, right now.
Mommy!
Hannah?
Mommy!
Hannah? What is it?
Oh, my God!
Max!
Max, come on!
Fire!
It's a good thing Hastings was
nearby and got here fast.
The whole place could've
burned down.
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Take care, man.
See you in the morning.
She asleep, baby?
The Ku Klux Klan is burning
crosses on our lawn, Jake.
Baby, there's been no Klan
around here for years, okay?
This is just a couple of dorks...
with too much time on their hands
and too many beers, alright?
I'm sorry.
About what?
That you weren't home...
when someone practically burned
our house down?
That you missed supper and
didn't even bother to call?
That lately you've become more
interested in getting on the news...
than what's going on with your
family?
Or that Hannah comes home every
day bawling...
because of other kids calling
her a nigger-lover?
What exactly are you sorry
about, Jake?
Remember the other night?
I told you Carl Lee came by
the office?
Remember what we talked about,
then?
About me calling Ozzie?
You never called him, did you?
You never called Sheriff Walls?
I didn't call him, baby.
Lord have mercy, Jake, you had
a responsibility.
Carl Lee chose you.
He told you what he was thinking.
He told me what he was thinking,
but I didn't know...
Jake Tyler Brigance, we agreed,
you were gonna call the sheriff.
Now look at everything that
has happened.
I am sorry to tell you this,
darling...
but those two boys are in the
ground...
and you were in a position to
prevent every bit of this.
Mama?
Are you and Daddy fighting?
No, baby. Come here.
Come here, baby. Come here.
Mommy's just upset because some
silly man played a real...
bad joke, okay?
There's nothing to worry about.
Nothing at all, okay?
What that Memphis doctor say
about her?
She's doing good.
Her jaw is healing.
She can't run and jump yet, but
it won't be long.
How about the other?
There was too much damage.
She ain't gonna never have kids.
You know, I think about them
two boys.
Dead, buried...
probably starting to rot.
And I remember them walking
in court...
one proud, the other scared.
I remember how they fell.
One on top of the other, and
screaming and squirming...
and not going nowhere.
God help me, Gwen, but...
that's the only thought gives
me comfort.
They took up a collection for
us at church Sunday night.
Some kind of defense fund.
Reverend Agee gave a good
service.
We need some money around the
house, Carl Lee...
for... for groceries and bills.
How much you got?
Less than 50.
I'll think of something.
How you think you going to get
some money...
while you stuck here in jail?
Trust me, Gwen.
I just get scared.
Look here.
Tell me exactly what Reverend
Agee said...
when he passed around the
collection plate.
I don't care what your record
says.
We are dealing with life and
death, here.
Well, I'm gonna have to talk
to my supervisor.
Well, you go talk to your supervisor.
Get out of here.
Morning, John. How are things
with the electric company?
Yes, Jake.
The electric company.
That is the second time this
week I've had to hold him off.
How much do we owe?
Two thousand dollars.
How much do we have?
One hundred dollars.
Now, look, this week nothing,
nothing has come in at all.
What about Buck Britt's retainer?
There's 2 grand.
That check bounced.
What do you mean, bounced?
It bounced, Jake.
It's been sitting on your desk
for a week.
Not that you'd notice.
Since you took this case, you...
you stopped talking to your
clients...
you don't take your calls, you...
You're obsessed. That's what
you are. You're obsessed, Jake.
Boy, your obsession is going
to break us.
Hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong, old girl? We've
been through hard times before.
Oh, not like this, Jake.
Not like this.
We've been getting calls.
At home.
Threats.
You know that Bud has survived
two strokes.
I don't think he would survive
a third.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why, Jake?
Would you drop the case?
Jake Brigance's office.
Until they cut the phones off.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Right.
That was Sheriff Walls.
You better get down to that
jail.
What's going on here, Carl Lee?
I'm Isaiah Street.
Jake Brigance.
Uh-huh.
Uh...
I believe you know Reverend Agee.
Jake.
And this is, uh...
Norman Reinfield.
I've seen your picture in the
paper.
I assume these boys carry your
briefcase.
Just a small part of my legal
defense team.
Pleasure, Mr. Brigance.
Mm-hm.
If this is a party, boys, where's
the chips and beer?
Otherwise, you being here...
seems a bit like illegal client
solicitation...
with Carl Lee already having
a lawyer, and all.
Well now, just a minute, Jake.
Carl Lee invited us here.
Mr. Brigance...
let me be frank.
Mr. Hailey's case has far-reaching
ramifications.
Carl Lee's acquittal for the
killings of two white men...
would do more for the black
people in Mississippi...
than any event since we integrated
the schools.
His conviction, on the other
hand, will be a slap at us.
A symbol of deep-seated racism.
Perhaps enough to ignite a
nation.
See how important this case is?
Enter Mr. Reinfield's death
squad, right?
It's an unfortunate nickname,
but apropos...
my lawyers and I handle only
capital-murder cases, Mr. Hailey.
Yeah, and of all your cases,
Norman...
how many are supposed to be
lost...
so you can martyr the victim?
Now, Mr. Brigance.
How much a defense like that
cost?
Yeah.
Would you say about 100,000?
We are prepared to accept 7.000
in litigation expenses.
Well, Carl Lee doesn't have
$7000.
Do you, Carl Lee?
The NAACP has raised $5000 for
Carl Lee's legal defense fund.
And we raised an additional
$2000 from the local churches.
Well, let me ask you something,
Reverend.
How much of that cash you offer
my wife and kids?
Oh, that money is to go to pay
for lawyers' fees...
and stuff like that.
That ain't what you told the
church, now, is it?
You almost cried when you
told them people...
how my family might starve...
if they didn't donate all they
could, didn't you?
Well, the money is for you
and your family, Carl Lee...
but we thought it'd be better
spent on your legal defense.
Well, speaking of that defense
fund...
can I use that for any lawyer
I want?
Well, it's not that simple,
Carl Lee.
Actually, it is that simple,
Carl Lee.
Unless the NAACP wants to go
on record as soliciting funds...
under false pretenses.
Listen, Carl Lee, we raised
that money...
for these men to get you out of
here, not for this cracker to...
Now, hey, hey, hey, now. Hold on.
Hold on right there, now.
Let me just get this straight
here, Reverend.
If you don't give my wife
that cash...
I'm gonna see to it everybody
in this town...
knows you're a lying crook.
I'm sure your congregation will
be interested to know that...
Gwen and the kids can't eat
because you want to get in bed...
with the NAACP.
That's right. By the time I get
through with you...
you won't be able to collect
two cents...
in that collection plate,
on Sunday.
We'll expect the check for the
Hailey family this afternoon...
Reverend Agee.
Reverend Street, I sure do
appreciate your fine work...
but I'm gonna take my chances
with Jake, here.
Thanks for coming down,
Mr. Reinfield.
Uh, and we'll be expecting that
check for Jake's legal services...
around the same time, this
afternoon.
Good day, men.
Go.
Go.
Good.
You set that whole thing up,
didn't you?
Couldn't have did it without
you, Jake.
Make one hell of a team, Carl Lee.
You out there, Jake.
I'm in here.
We ain't no team.
There's trouble.
Oh, lookie there.
No, here's trouble, Harry Rex.
Hi.
You are...
Roark, meet Mr. Harry Rex
Vonner...
the most effective, connected,
morally compromised lawyer...
in the country.
Oh. Ellen Roark, brilliant
law student.
Do with me as you will.
Looking forward to it.
Okay.
Um, well, thought this might
interest you.
In accessing all murder trials...
it seems that the insanity plea
only makes up...
one percent, overall.
And of the one percent of that
that resulted in acquittal...
success, rested almost wholly
on the...
On the defending psychiatrist...
regardless of the quality of
the psychological testimony.
Yeah.
Shazam!
She is brilliant.
"She..." that would be me?
Now, who else would "she" be?
So, "she" would be me.
"She" is saying that if I take
this plea to trial...
the verdict is going to hinge
on whose shrink...
the jury finds more credible.
"She," would be correct.
"She," would.
So, are you sure you don't need
any help?
I do. I'm hiring.
Right now. Me.
Roark, I am sure that I don't
need any help.
Thank you, though.
Okay.
I guess that would just have
to be your loss then, huh?
Nice to meet you, "Morally
Compromised."
Pleasure's all mine, "She".
Got to love the Lord for making
things like that.
Sure you don't wanna at least
take a peak...
at her resume, there, Lone Ranger?
Not like you couldn't use the
help.
No, I don't want to look at
her resume, Harry Rex...
because I have you.
You do?
Yeah, buddy.
This is your chance to put
aside your shady sources...
your back-alley deals...
your greedy divorcees, and do
some real law, for a change.
Mr. Vonner, in short...
you now have the opportunity to
work on a case that matters.
Let me get this straight.
You want me to put aside my
empty, soulless, shady...
astonishingly lucrative, divorcee
practice...
come work with you on an
unwinnable, bleeding-heart...
lose-all-my-friends...
straight-to-the-gas-chamber case,
cause it matters?
That is a novel idea, I know.
No way, never, presumptuous
little shit.
Good night, y'all.
Hello?
I need the sheriff.
He's sleeping now.
Well, get him up.
Who is this?
Someone's gonna die tonight.
I got him!
Get his ass, Ozzie!
What's in the case?
This thing's ticking.
What's in the case?
I ain't saying, nigger.
Family out of the house?
Yeah.
It's locked.
Now I want you to open that.
Oh, man...
Defuse it.
I'm gonna take you and this
nigger-lover to hell with...
Ain't nothing more dangerous
in this world...
than a fool with a cause.
Jake, just lay that thing back
down there...
and let's get the hell out
of here.
Carla loves this house.
How you doing, Stan?
Hey, how you doing?
Come here, girl.
Daddy, are you coming to
Grandpa's too?
Mm-mm. Not this time, baby.
Daddy's gotta stay here and work.
You and your mama have a good
time though, okay?
All right.
All right. You be good.
Go get your stuff down there.
You said you'd withdraw, if
it got too dangerous.
I know.
But I can't quit now, you
know that.
Carl Lee Hailey's facing the
gas chamber, baby.
The man is counting on me.
I understand that, Jake.
I want you to remember that
we're counting on you too.
What if something happens
to you?
Nothing's gonna happen to
me, baby. Come here.
Give me a hug?
Hmm?
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'm gonna be fine, you're
gonna be fine. Okay?
Okay, babe?
I promise.
Watch you don't make your wife
promises you can't keep.
Hannah?
You ready?
Uh-huh.
Last boarding call.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Come in.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You may come this way.
The judge is upstairs.
Thank you, sir.
Judge Noose.
Thanks for coming.
Heard you had a little trouble
last night.
Yes, sir.
Makes you wonder about the
sensibleness of taking this case...
don't it, Jake?
This is a beautiful place you
have here, judge.
I'll get to the point.
I've thoroughly reviewed your
brief request...
in that, uh, change of venue...
and I agree with you. I think
it's impossible to find...
a fair and impartial jury here
in Canton.
In fact, I think it's impossible
to find a fair and impartial jury...
anywhere in Mississippi.
And as such...
a jury here would be...
as fair as a jury anywhere else.
So, I've decided to deny your
request for a change of venue.
Well, I guess that...
gives me something to appeal.
Uh, actually, no.
I spoke to Judge Dent...
and he led me to believe...
that the supreme court would
uphold my ruling.
You certainly have covered
your bases, judge.
Jake, you're a good lawyer.
You're bright and ambitious.
Talented.
You could be somebody, around
here.
You sure you wanna be known as
the man that defended that...
murderer?
Could be very unpopular.
Talk to your client.
He pleads guilty...
I'll recommend Buckley accept
a plea of manslaughter.
He'd be out in twenty.
Yeah.
And how's his wife supposed
to raise his family alone?
Better than being a widow.
Think about it.
Why toss away a promising
career, hmm?
Good day, judge.
Thanks for coming.
All right, Lucien.
Where the hell is this guy?
Born alcoholic.
But the man cannot hold his
liquor.
Jake, allow me to present
Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.
Expert witness for the defense.
W.T., this is Jake Brigance, my
protege.
Dr. Bass.
Are you kidding me?
No, relax.
When he's sober, he's terrific.
He has his license, his
credentials are impeccable.
Well?
I need a drink.
Three in the afternoon?
My, oh, my.
What would your wife say?
I am my own man, Lucien.
I drink when I want to.
When did she leave town?
This morning.
God!
Bud?
Oh, my...
That's enough.
Now, you tell your boss...
next time people are gonna die.
Oh, Bud.
Oh, Bud.
Hi.
Morning.
Nice parking job.
Late night?
Yeah.
So, um... here.
Oh, thank you.
Your wife lets you sleep at
the office?
My wife left town.
That's too bad.
So, listen, I heard that, uh...
Judge Noose turned down your
change of venue.
Yeah.
I think it's time you let me
take you out to breakfast.
Lunch.
Quit playing with that food.
But, ladies, y'all come back.
You need to finish that
before Christmas.
Thank you, treasure.
Now, the other night, you said
you're opposed to the death penalty.
Yes, sir.
Why?
You're not?
Mm-mm.
Actually, I'm very much in
favor of it.
I'd like to go back to hangings
on the courthouse lawn...
if we could.
You're kidding, right?
No.
The only problem with the death
penalty, Roark...
is that we do not use it enough.
Well, have you told your client,
Carl Lee Hailey, this?
Carl Lee Hailey does not deserve
the death penalty.
Now, the two men who raped his
daughter did.
Okay, so how do you decide who
dies and who doesn't?
Well, simple. Okay, you take the
crime and you take the criminal.
Now, say a crack dealer guns
down an undercover cop.
Well, you strap his ass to
the chair, flip the switch.
For some reason, I thought
you were a liberal.
Well, I am a liberal, Roark.
What I am not, is a card-carrying
ACLU radical.
I do not believe in forgiveness,
nor in rehabilitation.
I believe in safety.
I believe in justice.
I see.
Well, let me ask you something.
Have you ever seen a man
executed?
Not that I recall.
Then what I suggest you do...
is you go watch a man be
executed.
You watch him die, you watch
him beg...
you watch him kick and spit
the life out of him...
until he pisses and shits in
his pants, until he's gone.
Then, you know what?
Then you come back here...
and you sing this crap to me
about justice...
Roark, spare me your Northern,
liberal, "Cry me a river...
we are the only enlightened
ones...
in the northern hemispere",
bullshit.
I'm so sorry, yes, you are
the enlightened.
Yes, you are the enlightened.
And that's why you brought me
to this black diner...
in this black neighborhood,
right? Right...
so you can convince me you're
this "JFK meets Jesus Christ..."
white boy.
Is that... is that what it is?
Or is it because you're another
repressed, hypocritical...
souther provincial...
who maybe didn't want to be seen
around town...
with a woman like myself?
Yes, you sure are enlightened.
Well, you know what?
I'm terribly sorry, I've made
a mistake.
I thought you were one of the
good guys.
Thank you very much for your
time, Mr. Brigance.
Do it.
I get a little worked up.
Guess that's not the best way
to apply for a job, huh?
I don't want the jury to see
those pictures...
of the dead rapists. Can we
keep them out of court?
No.
Also, it is vital that I admit
the rape.
I want the jury to know details.
I'm gonna need briefs on both.
I don't like your politics,
Roark, but you do have passion...
and that's something Carl Lee
needs right now...
and maybe so do I.
Are you getting this?
I'm writing it down.
All right, here's what we got.
It's official.
The trial of Carl Lee Hailey
will be held in Canton.
Today, presiding Judge Noose
issued 150 summonses...
for potential jurors, in a
sealed envelope.
Now, to prevent tampering...
that list will be kept strictly
confidential...
until jury selection begins
on Wednesday.
No one, not even Mr. Brigance,
or myself...
will know the identities of the
potential jurors in this case.
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Beautiful day, isn't it?
There he is.
Any word on Bud?
Ethel's still with him.
Thank you for coming, sir.
Well, well, well.
The Pillsbury Doughboy.
Still practicing exploitative
law?
Thought you were dead.
Well, I'm trying.
Who do we have here?
Miss Roark, I would like to
introduce to you...
Lucien Wilbanks, third white man
in Mississippi to join the NAACP...
permanently disbarred by the
superior court...
um... for attacking police...
who busted a picket line in the
EPSO oil strike.
It is a pleasure, Ms. Ark.
All right, everybody, jury
selection begins this afternoon.
Now, to win this case, we need a
sympathetic jury...
jury willing to acquit...
and a jury that can use the
insanity plea...
as an excuse to do so.
I'm gonna need a drink.
No drinking.
What do you mean, no drinking?
It's my building...
built by my grandfather, leased
to you for a reasonable rent...
and I want a drink.
Ms. Ark, I have all the respect
in the world for you.
I believe in your right to equal
pay for equal work...
your right to bear a child, or
to abort one.
I think you should be treated
just like a man.
And since you are a law clerk...
genderless in my eyes...
I think you should be the one
to go buy the beer.
Yeah. ERA she-woman, that would
be an excellent activity...
for you, this afternoon.
Hey, no drinking.
Not today.
Now, Noose selects this panel
at random.
If we get too many bad candidates,
we're sunk.
Luck of the draw.
What you need...
is young fathers who wanna do
what Carl Lee Hailey did.
Agreed. I think we need young
men with families here.
Now, I would prefer no one
over fifty.
Less bigotry, as a rule, with
youth.
So, we stay away from women,
rednecks and old men.
Uh, citizens, thank you.
Now, counsel, you each have
twelve challenges. Let's begin.
Your Honor, the state challenges
Jurors Number 6, 10...
and 32.
Your Honor, the defense strikes
Jurors 1, 4, 8 and 2.
Twenty-six, 27, 28 and 31.
Your Honor, the defense also
strikes Jurors 22 and 29.
Now that's it, then. Mr. Brigance,
you're all out of challenges.
We're done.
Jurors, you will be sequestered,
starting tonight.
Opening statements begin
tomorrow morning.
That's a jury of my peers?
God bless America.
My name is Stump Sisson...
and I'm proud to be a "Grand
Dragon..."
for the Invisible Empire of the
Ku Klux Klan.
What the hell?
And I'm here to say that the
law-abiding...
white folks of Mississippi...
are sick and tired of niggers
stealing, raping, killing...
and getting away with it!
Ozzie, let's get them out of
here.
We demand justice.
We demand this nigger be convicted...
and his black ass sent to the
gas chamber.
Who you calling nigger?
You pointy-headed, white-faced,
no-good...
wife-beating son of a whore!
Shut up, you wild animal!
Animal? You're the damn animal!
I'll drag your ass out of here!
You're the damn animal!
Unh!
Come on!
Come on!
Come here, come here!
That's right, go on!
Hastings!
Hastings!
What's going on?
This is for Billy Ray.
Open! Open the gate!
Open the gate!
Turn around.
You know, I can't get to this.
Just take off your pants.
Come on, Roark, do I look
that easy?
Are you afraid I'm gonna see you
in your underwear?
With Carla gone, the laundry's
piling up. I'm not wearing any.
It's all right, I haven't worn
any in years.
Look, I'm not gonna watch, I
promise. Now strip, please.
All right, fine.
Batter up.
What I need from you, Roark...
Do tell.
Is a way to discredit the state's
shrink, Dr. Rodeheaver.
Unless you discredit the shrink...
Carl Lee does not have a chance.
Mm.
Sorry.
Sissy.
I think he's got a very good
chance.
There you go. I think you're
gonna live. All right.
Thanks.
Whoo.
Good butt.
Ugh.
So, uh...
What do you folks do around
here to blow off steam...
besides trying to kill each other
in town's square?
You got discos, or...
strip bars, or malls, or anything,
to go to?
Stump's dead.
He's dead, Freddie.
Come on, Freddie.
Let's go on home.
It's all over.
It ain't near over.
How you doing? Good to see you.
Excuse me.
Hey, I'll be right back.
Here are your mud bugs.
Mm-hm.
There you go, darling.
Anything else?
Yeah, a couple of dinner specials...
and some fried dill pickles.
You got it, honey.
Thank you, Sugar.
That wasn't sexist at all. Really,
I never order my own food.
I can't do another shot.
All right, fine, I'll take
another shot.
Just a splash.
Just a splash.
All right.
To...
To...
Carl Lee Hailey.
May our jury find that man loony
as a proverbial fruitcake.
Hear, hear.
No more.
So, um...
Do you think he was crazy
when he did it?
No, he wasn't crazy.
He told me he was gonna do it.
I tried to tell myself he
wasn't serious.
I think I really wanted him
to do it.
I came home that night and I was
looking at Hannah laying there...
looking how tender she is.
All I could think about was
all the monsters out there...
and any one of them can come
steal her innocence.
Take her life, if they wanted.
Yeah, I wanted those boys dead.
You're goddamn right I did.
I guess I helped killed them.
So, tomorrow, when we get in
court...
it's not just Carl Lee I'm
trying to get off.
Burn in hell, Brigance!
Good job.
Nice place.
How is it that you'll drive an
hour and half...
outside of town to take me to
dinner, but...
you have no problem walking me
into my motel room?
Well, with everything that's
going on...
I don't think we can be too
careful.
Just wanna make sure it's all
safe in here.
I'm not scared.
Oh, yes, I am.
Of what?
Of what's going to
happen tomorrow.
All the other cases I've worked on
have only been paper defendants.
It's just I never knew the
towns...
and I never touched their lives,
or anything.
So, I don't know what it's like.
Tomorrow morning...
Buckley will try to kill
Carl Lee Hailey.
Now, it's on us to stop him.
Mm-hm.
So, tonight, go over the battle
in your mind.
Argument, rebuttal, examination
and cross. All of it.
Mm-hm.
Remember something.
Hmm.
You are one of the good guys.
Okay.
And good guy has got the spicy
on her lip...
Spicy?
but still one of the good guys.
I'm going home.
Lock the door behind me, Roark.
I'll see you in the morning.
It's gonna blow, sheriff.
It's gonna blow.
Oz is right over there!
Wait. Wait. Hold it, Jake.
Hold it, Jake.
My dog's in there.
Jake...
My dog's in there!
Max!
Come on.
Come on.
Max!
Max!
It's too late.
Move, move, move.
Hey, buddy.
Seen my dog?
Looking for my dog.
Max, come here, boy! Let's go!
Come on, Max!
I booked you on the 9:15 to
Gulf port. Economy, of course.
Go see your wife and daughter,
Jake.
What'd you do that for, Harry
Rex?
We got trial in less than
three hours.
Oh, come on.
Noose would give you a
continuance, in a flash.
NAACP boys be down here before
lunch. Drooling.
Max, let's go, boy!
Come on!
Jake, listen to me.
Your marriage is on the rocks,
you're about to have an affair.
Your career's in ruins if you're
lucky...
and if you're not, you're dead.
Don't get me wrong, my friend.
What you've put into this case,
you even inspired me, and I'm...
I'm uninspirable.
Do everyone a favor, though.
Drop the case.
No, I can't.
I won't.
I'm not gonna quit.
I quit now, and all this is
for nothing. No.
Max, come on now. Max, where
are you? Come on, Max!
Max is dead, and you're next.
Walk away.
Max.
Come here, boy.
Come here. Come here, boy.
Ha-ha-ha.
Come here.
Come here.
Who's got the goods, huh?
Huh?
Pre-trial strategy at my office in
less than two hours, Harry Rex...
and I expect to see your ass
there.
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee.
Free Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee!
Free Carl Lee! Free Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Fry Carl Lee!
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Good morning.
Good morning.
You are Cora Mae Cobb, the
mother of Billy Ray Cobb...
the deceased, are you not?
Yes, sir.
And where were you when your
son was murdered?
I was right outside that door
right there.
Me and Freddie was waiting
for his hearing.
He was walking up the stairs...
in handcuffs.
Can you tell us how old your son
was at the time of his death?
Twenty-three.
You say your son was twenty-three
when he died?
Yes.
In those twenty-three years,
Mrs. Cobb...
how many other children did
your son kidnap?
Objection, Your Honor!
Objection!
Sustained. You... you are out
of order, Mr. Brigance.
Withdraw the question.
The jury will disregard...
the last question from Mr. Brigance.
Mrs. Cobb, in your son's twenty
three years...
how many other children did
he rape?
Mr. Brigance!
In my chambers.
Court will recess for lunch.
I don't get it. Why is he
antagonizing the judge?
He should've known Noose'd
pull him into chambers.
Of course he knew.
But Jake's got to draw first
blood, and he knows...
that's more important, to get
Noose a little sweaty.
Hello, Harry.
Hi, Rufie.
Hey sweetheart, you wanna
come play on a winning team?
How's that impotence thing,
Rufus?
You're not being paid for the
work you're doing with...
Mr. Brigance, are you?
No, sir.
Well, I guess Jake's paying you
in other ways, then, isn't he?
Impotence?
Yep.
Girls talk.
Sheriff, if you would, will you
please identify this weapon?
It's the weapon found
at the scene.
And were you able to identify
any of the fingerprints...
found on this gun?
Yes. The prints on the gun matched
those of Carl Lee Hailey.
You're sure?
Yes.
Your Honor, I'd like to enter this
into evidence as Exhibit S-18.
We have no further use of this
witness.
Sheriff Walls.
Did you arrest Billy Ray Cobb
and Pete Willard?
Yes, I did.
I arrested them for the rape...
and attempted murder of
ten-year-old Tonya Hailey.
And is it true that Pete
Willard...
signed a written confession...
saying that he and Billy Ray
Cobb did rape Tonya Hailey?
Objection. That's inadmissible,
and Mr. Brigance knows it.
Mr. Brigance, I've spoken to
you before.
We are not trying the rape
of Miss Hailey today...
but the murder of two young
men...
and if you continue in this
performance...
I'll hold you in contempt.
Now, is that understood?
Yes, sir.
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.
Yes.
You say something, sheriff?
Yes, he did sign a confession.
Objection, Your Honor!
Jurors, you will disregard the
last remark of Sheriff Walls.
Court is adjourned till tomorrow
morning, 9:00.
I'm taking Bud back to Oxford.
He always missed Oxford.
I don't know what to say, Ethel,
I don't know.
There's nothing you can say.
I know you didn't want any of
this to happen...
but it happened all the same.
You wagered all our lives on
this.
You just went ahead and did
what you felt you had to do...
no matter what the cost.
Some folks think that's brave.
Not me, Jake.
Now, you may win...
but I think we've all lost here.
Would you help an old lady to
her car?
You don't need any help, Ethel...
but it would be my honor to
escort you to your automobile.
Didn't like that one?
Buckley is presenting his shrink
tomorrow, and I can't come up...
with one way to bring him
down. Not one.
I keep asking myself, okay,
what would Jake do?
What would my father do?
What would Lucien do?
That's your problem, right there.
What you gotta ask yourself is,
"What would Harry Rex do?"
What would Harry Rex do?
Cheat.
Cheat like crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
I'll bring her around the side.
Uh-huh.
Hey, Cheryl.
Hi.
So, we gotta talk about it.
Now, wait a minute.
The judge said absolutely not
to discuss this case.
That judge ain't stuck here
away from his wife and kids.
The sooner we start talking about
it, the sooner we can get home.
I wanna get out of here just
as much as anybody else.
Let's get on with it.
Undecided?
Four.
Guilty?
Seven.
Not guilty?
That nigger's dead, y'all.
I know, I know.
Folks in town just can't get
enough of this Hailey trial.
And that's why, see, the editor...
said I needed to come right on
down...
and get an interview with
Dr. Rodeheaver.
I'm afraid Dr. Rodeheaver's
in court, today.
Oh.
You know, if a pretty girl like
you wants to be a reporter...
maybe she should do some better
research?
Yeah...
Well, um, you know what?
I don't... I don't mind waiting...
cause my paper really wants
this interview...
so, is he still in Room 369?
I'll just go there.
No, dear. Wrong again. He's
in 128. But he's gone all day.
You can't see him today.
You wanna come back to my office
and we can schedule an appointment?
You know what?
I'll come back another time...
when he's, you know, got time to
talk, when things kind of die down.
But I really appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
Well, you can call me any time.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Your Honor, the state calls
Deputy Dwayne Looney.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Would you please state your
name for the record?
Deputy Dwayne Powell Looney.
Thank you, Deputy Looney.
You were present at the murders
of Billy Ray Cobb...
and James Lewis Willard, were
you not?
Yes, sir.
I was.
If you can remember...
describe how you were wounded
for the members of the jury.
I think bullets bounced off the
floor, caught me in the knee.
And what happened to your leg?
Doc cut it off.
And after the loss of your right
leg, Detective Looney...
are you still able to serve
as a police officer?
I'm able to perform...
I'm able to perform a number
of services.
Did you get a good look at the
man with the gun?
No, sir.
However, Mr. Hailey did personally
apologize for his shooting me.
Oh.
So, Mr. Hailey admitted
shooting you.
Yes, sir.
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.
Mr. Brigance.
No questions, Your Honor.
Wait a minute.
Uh, Mr. Buckley?
Yes, Your Honor.
The state would like to call...
Your owner, can you give me a
moment to speak with my client?
Take your time.
Ask him if he thinks I ought
to go to jail.
Carl Lee, they amputated his
leg because you shot him.
He's a witness for the prosecution.
You're my lawyer, ain't you?
Yeah.
Ask him.
Your Honor, one question.
Make up your mind, Mr. Brigance.
Deputy Looney.
Do you think Carl Lee shooting
you was intentional?
No, sir.
It was an accident.
Ask him.
Do you think he should be
punished for shooting you?
No, sir.
I hold no ill will toward the
man.
He did what I would've done.
What do you mean by that,
Deputy Looney?
I mean, I don't blame him for
what he did.
Those boys raped his little girl.
Objection, Your Honor!
The witness's opinion on this
matter is irrelevant.
Your Honor, I believe Deputy
Looney...
has earned the right to speak
here, today.
Overruled.
Continue.
Go ahead, Dwayne.
I got a little girl.
Somebody rapes her, he's a
dead dog.
I'll blow him away, just like
Carl Lee did.
Objection, Your Honor!
Do you think the jury should
convict Carl Lee Hailey?
Don't answer that question,
deputy.
He's a hero.
You turn him loose.
Jury will disregard.
You turn him loose!
Your Honor, you silence that
witness!
Turn him loose!
No!
People say whatever the hell
they want in this courtroom!
Quiet!
Any more of that nonsense...
and you're all out of here.
Now, Mr. Buckley, you may begin.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Would you please state your
name and occupation...
for the members of the jury,
if you will?
My name is Dr. Wilbert Rodeheaver,
chair of Psychiatry...
at Mississippi State University...
and clinical director of the
Whitfield Facility...
for the Criminally Insane.
Thank you, doctor. Your credentials
speak for themselves.
Now, doctor, can you please
explain...
as you do so eloquently in your
book...
the McNaughton Rule, for the
jury?
Certainly.
The McNaughton Rule states...
that a person must be unable to
tell right from wrong...
and, or, be unaware of the
consequences of his actions...
to be termed legally insane.
Now, did you examine Mr. Hailey?
Yes. Mr. Hailey and I spoke about
his childhood, his family...
his experiences during the war.
And the rape of his daughter?
Yes, we, uh, we spoke at length
about the brutal rape...
of his daughter, Tonya.
What is your diagnosis of
Mr. Hailey's mental condition...
on the day that he shot Billy Ray
Cobb and James Lewis Willard?
At the time of the murders, his
mental condition...
was without any defects of any
nature.
Mr. Hailey was sane.
But wait a minute, doctor.
The defense contends...
Why, Mr. Brigance has gone to great
effort to prove to this jury...
that Mr. Hailey is a nutball.
Is a slow coach.
Or... what's the clinical
definition?
Insane.
Do you disagree?
Yes.
Carl Lee Hailey knew very well
what he was doing.
He slaughtered those men in
cold blood.
Thank you, doctor.
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.
Buddy, where the hell is Roark?
I got no clue.
Cross-examination, Mr. Brigance?
Your Honor, we would request
a recess until...
No, we will not need a recess, Your
Honor, but just a few moments.
Mr. Brigance?
When you and Lois Lane are ready...
Just a few questions, Your Honor.
Doctor, who do you work for?
State of Mississippi.
In your eleven years...
how many times have you testified
to trials...
where the insanity defense
was used?
This is my forty-sixth trial.
Forty-sixth trial.
Well, of those forty-six trials...
how many times have you testified...
that the defendant was legally
insane?
Objection, Your Honor! The
good doctor cannot be asked...
to recall all of his testimony at
these previous trials. It's absurd.
Overruled.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I can't remember.
Could it be, doctor, the reason
you can't remember...
is that in eleven years and
forty-six trials...
you never have seen a defendant
whom you have found insane?
I can't recall at this time.
Can you recall testifying at
the trial of one Dan Baker?
Objection!
Your Honor...
this has nothing to do with
the proceedings, here.
Overruled.
This... this better be good,
Mr. Brigance.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'll ask again.
Can you recall testifying the
trial of one Dan Baker?
It's a rather brutal double
homicide...
where you found the defendant
legally sane?
Yes.
A dissenting psychiatrist
disagreed with you, doctor.
And Mr. Baker was found insane,
and institutionalized.
Where is he currently, doctor?
At Whitfield.
And who is the chief psychiatrist
at Whitfield?
I am.
You are.
Dr. Rodeheaver is the chief
psychiatrist at Whitfield.
Now, help me make this clear
to the jury, doctor.
In 1985, you testified that
Dan Baker was legally sane.
The jury disagreed with you.
And Mr. Baker was found not
guilty, by reason of insanity.
Since that time, he has been
a patient in your hospital...
under your care...
as a paranoid schizophrenic.
Is that correct, doctor?
Yes.
Do you normally admit patients...
keep and treat them for ten years,
if they're of sound mind and body?
Of course not.
Then it would be fair to say...
that you find insane people sane,
for the purposes of trial?
Objection, Your Honor!
This is argumentative!
Withdraw the question, Your
Honor. No further questions.
Genius, Roark.
Mr. Brigance! Mr. Brigance!
Yes. Yes.
How do you expect to get a fair
trial in Mississippi?
Get him!
Get an ambulance, get, get!
Come on.
So, is there any news on the
guard who was shot?
Ozzie says he's probably
paralyzed.
Some stranger...
somebody's husband...
somebody's son...
put himself in harm's way...
for me.
When I saw the blood...
I got so scared, because I
thought that was you.
Do you want me to stay?
Yeah.
I want you to stay.
So, you better go.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Speed limit's 45, not 70, ma'am.
Haven't been drinking, have you?
I guess I just wasn't...
Let me ask you to get out of
the car, for just a minute.
Is that really necessary?
Just get out of the car.
Isn't it usually customary to ask
for a license and registration?
You bitch.
No!
Get her in the car.
No! No!
Come on.
Get in there.
Shut up!
You can't blame a nigger for
being a nigger...
no more than you can blame a
dog for being a dog.
But a whore like you...
co-mingling with mongrels,
betraying your own...
that makes you worse than being
a nigger.
So I'll tell you what I'm gonna
do.
I'm gonna leave you tied up
here naked.
First it'll just be the bugs
eating at you.
One day, maybe two.
That sun's gonna be cooking you.
But them animals?
They're gonna pick up your
stink.
They're gonna come looking for
something to eat.
Carl Lee Hailey should've shot
you, too.
Come on, boys.
Let's go.
No... no... no.
No... no.
Shh.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, now.
It's okay.
Mr. Brigance, you may call
your first witness.
Yes, Your Honor. Defense calls
Dr. Willard Tyrell Bass.
Buddy, have you seen Roark?
Not yet.
Doctor, would you explain to
the jury...
the effect his daughter's rape
had on Mr. Hailey's condition?
Tonya's rape caused a relapse...
a temporary break with reality.
But yesterday, a Dr. Rodeheaver...
suggested that Mr. Hailey's
act of calculation was...
the very definition of sanity.
That's ridiculous.
Many of the most famous
schizophrenics are calculating.
John Hinckley, for example.
Calculating.
And legally insane.
All right, so, Dr. Bass, how
would you diagnose Mr. Hailey...
at the time of the murder?
Mr. Hailey experienced a recurrence
of a dissociative condition...
as a result of the trauma caused
by the rape of his daughter.
Now, since Mr. Hailey was unaware
of the reality of his actions...
he could not tell right from
wrong.
Nor could he understand the
consequences of his actions.
He was, therefore, legally
insane.
Could not tell right from wrong...
nor understand the consequences
of his actions.
Therefore, legally, insane.
Thank you, Dr. Bass. Your Honor,
I have no further questions.
Mr. Buckley?
Mr. Buckley.
Yes?
Your witness.
Oh. I'm sorry, excuse me.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Dr. Bass, could you please state
for the record your full name?
Willard Tyrell Bass.
Tyrell Bass.
That's a very unique name.
Now, doctor, have you ever
been convicted of a felony?
No, of course not.
You're certain?
Yes.
As certain of that as you are
of the testimony you've just...
given before this jury?
Of course.
So, let me understand this,
now...
since you are under oath.
You're telling me, and this jury,
that on October 17th, 1960...
you were not convicted of
statutory rape?
Objection, Your Honor!
Dr. Bass is not on trial here.
This goes to the heart of the
credibility of the witness.
Overruled. Continue, Mr. Buckley.
Thank you.
Now, doctor...
were you convicted of statutory
rape?
You've got the wrong man.
Really?
I have some mighty interesting
photographs of you...
taken with a female under-age...
in a motel, by the Dallas
Police Department...
on September 11th, 1960.
Would you like to look at these
visual images...
and see if they refresh your
memory?
No, I didn't think so.
Your Honor, we would like to
enter into evidence...
these court and police records...
showing that on September 15th,
1960, this man, one Tyrell Bass...
pled guilty to statutory rape.
Now, doctor, I'm gonna ask you
one last time...
were you, or were you not,
convicted of statutory rape?
Well, I can explain...
I'm not interested in your
explanation, doctor.
Just answer the question,
yes or no.
Yes.
Yes, I was.
That's enough.
I have nothing further, your
Honor.
Redirect, Mr. Brigance?
None, Your Honor.
Court will recess one hour
for lunch.
You told me you knew him, he
was a credible witness.
I didn't know about the conviction.
The record was expunged.
Buckley really outdid himself
this time.
Damn.
Lucien, I was counting on you.
And I can't win...
You wanted this case.
Well, you got it.
It isn't easy saving the world
one case at a time...
but you stick with it.
You might just have a knack
for it.
Don't do what I did.
Don't quit.
What are you talking
about, quit?
You're a hero, Lucien.
Oh, hero, my ass.
D'you think the world needed me
beating cops' heads...
on that picket line?
I was needed here, in that
courtroom.
And I let them push me.
I gave them an excuse to kick
me out...
and now I can never plead a
case in there, again.
But you can.
You're an attorney.
Be proud.
Your job is to find justice...
no matter how well she may
hide herself from you.
So, you go on in there...
and you do your job.
Hurry up, now.
They'll be starting without
you.
Come with me.
I can't, Jake.
I love you...
but I can't.
You know that.
I'll never go in another
courtroom again.
And I can't be you, Lucien.
Don't be me.
Be better than me.
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Omar Noose.
And how did you feel?
I felt, um...
I don't know.
It was like I was outside
myself...
watching myself.
And all the while I kept hearing
my baby say:
"I called for you, Daddy.
When them men was hurting me...
I called for you over and over,
but...
"you didn't never come."
Thank you, Mr. Hailey.
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.
You have an emergency phone call.
Mr. Buckley?
Mr. Hailey...
before you stepped outside of
yourself...
to watch yourself shoot Mr. Willard
and Mr. Cobb...
were you aware that if convicted...
they might be freed in only ten
years?
Yes, I heard people say that.
Yes, sir.
Do you think men who kidnap
a child...
should be free in ten years?
No, sir.
Do you think two men who rape
a child...
should be free in ten years?
No, sir.
Do you think two men who hang
a child...
should be free in ten years?
No.
Well, what do you think should
happen to them?
What would be a fair sentence?
Objection, your Honor!
Do you think they...
deserve to die, Mr. Hailey?
Your honor?
Answer the question.
Now, Mr. Buckley...
Carl Lee, don't answer...
Do you think...
that question!
they deserved to die?
Yes, they deserved to die, and
I hope they burn in hell!
I have nothing further, Your
Honor.
Summations begin tomorrow.
Court adjourned.
Jake, they found Roark.
Ellen...
Hmm.
Ellen.
So...
this is what I had to do to
get you to call me "Ellen"?
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.
No.
Don't sweat it, really.
They didn't... they didn't hurt
anything that won't heal.
Nothing.
Besides, um, Dr., uh...
what's-his-name said I'll be
out in a couple days...
so, I'm fine.
How'd we do?
Bass turned out to be a felon.
Carl Lee got trapped on the
stand by Buckley.
People been terrorized, Roark.
Beaten.
Killed.
It...
it's not worth it.
It's not.
It's only not worth it if Carl
Lee goes to the gas chamber.
Listen, this case is not over
until the summation.
Remember that.
Okay?
And you've got one big fat
chance...
to reinvent yourself.
To make that jury see this whole
case...
this whole case through your
eyes.
And they're good eyes.
Now, get out of here, go to
work.
I'll keep in touch with you.
No, you won't.
Big liar.
Win or lose, Roark...
we make one hell of a team.
We might have.
We really might have.
You really want to kiss me
right now, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Undecided?
Guilty?
Hey, Max.
Hey.
Where's Hannah?
I left her at mother and daddy's.
How did you get here?
Drove.
In the storm?
Got something to say, it needs
to be said in person.
The truth is, I've been blaming
you for all that's happened.
But it's not your fault.
You didn't kill those boys.
You were trying to make things
right.
I know that now.
I thought you took this case
because you wanted to prove...
what a bigtime lawyer you were.
But I was wrong.
You took this case because...
if those boys...
had hurt Hannah the way that
they hurt Tonya...
you would've killed
them yourself.
Baby.
Baby, come here.
Come here.
I love you, Jake.
I thought I was gonna lose you.
We're gonna lose this case,
Carl Lee.
There are no more points of
law to argue, here.
I wanna cop a plea.
Maybe Buckley will cop us...
a second-degree murder and we
can get you just life in prison.
Jake, I... I can't do no life
in prison.
You gotta get me off.
Man, if it was you on trial...
It's not me.
We're not the same, Carl Lee.
The jury has to identify with
the defendant.
They see you, they see
a yard worker.
They see me, they see an attorney.
I live in town, you live on the
hill.
Oh, you white and I'm black.
See, Jake?
You think just like them.
That's why I picked you.
You're one of them, don't you
see?
You think you ain't, because
you eat in Claude's...
and you're out there trying
to get me off on TV...
talking about black and white.
But the fact is...
you're just like all the rest
of them.
When you look at me, you don't
see a man.
You see a black man.
Carl Lee, I am your friend.
We ain't no friends, Jake.
We're on different sides of
the line.
I ain't never seen you in my
part of town.
I bet you don't even know
where I live.
Our daughters, Jake, they ain't
never gonna play together.
Now, what are you talking about?
America is a war...
and you are on the other side.
How a black man ever gonna get
a fair trial...
with the enemy on the bench
and the jury box?
My life in white hands.
You, Jake.
That's how.
You my secret weapon because
you're one of the bad guys.
You don't mean to be, but
you are.
It's how you was raised.
Nigger, negro, black, African
American.
No matter how you see me...
you see me as different.
You see me like that jury
sees me.
You are them.
Now, throw out your points of
law, Jake.
If you was on that jury...
what would it take to convince
you to set me free?
That's how you'll save my ass.
That's how you'll save us both.
Is Carl Lee Hailey insane?
It's a notion so outrageous...
the only witness the defense
could produce to support it...
was a convicted felon.
No. Carl Lee Hailey is
not insane.
This is a man who is a
confessed murderer.
This is a man who admitted
on this stand...
to carrying out the sentences he
believed the alleged rapists...
of his daughter deserved.
He's taken justice out of
your hands.
And put it in his own.
And with those hands, he took
the lives of two young men.
We feel terrible over what
happened to his daughter.
But feeling terrible...
and knowing something is wrong
does not give any of us...
a right to kill.
Ladies and gentlemen, your
duty is clear.
All in this courtroom know
the truth.
All in this state know the
truth.
Now you need only find the
courage to speak the words:
"Carl Lee Hailey is guilty."
Guilty!
Guilty!
The State rests, Your Honor.
Now, I had a great summation
all worked out...
full of some sharp lawyering.
But I'm not going to read it.
I'm here to apologize.
I am young, and I am inexperienced.
But you cannot hold Carl Lee
Hailey responsible...
for my shortcomings.
But you see, in all this
legal maneuvering...
something has gotten lost.
And that something is the truth.
Now, it is incumbent upon us
lawyers...
not to just talk about the
truth...
but to actually seek it, to
find it, to live it.
My teacher taught me that.
Let's take Dr. Bass, for example.
Obviously, I would've never
knowingly...
put a convicted felon on the
stand.
I hope you can believe that.
But what is the truth?
That... that he's a disgraced
liar?
What if I told you...
that the woman he was accused
of raping was seventeen...
he was twenty-three...
that she later became his wife,
bore his child...
and is still married to the
man, today?
Does that make his testimony
more, or less true?
What is it in us that seeks
the truth?
Is it our minds?
Or is it our hearts?
I set out to prove a black man...
could receive a fair trial in the
South...
that we are all equal in the
eyes of the law.
That's not the truth.
Because the eyes of the law
are human eyes...
yours and mine, and until we
can see each other as equals...
justice is never going to be
even-handed.
It will remain nothing more...
than a reflection of our own
prejudices.
So, until that day...
we have a duty under God to
seek the truth...
not with our eyes, and not
with our minds...
where fear and hate turn
commonality into prejudice...
but with our hearts.
Where we don't know better.
Now, I wanna tell you a story.
And I ask you all to close
your eyes...
while I tell you this story.
I want you to listen to me.
And I want you to listen to
yourselves.
Go ahead.
Close your eyes, please.
This is a story about a little
girl...
walking home from the grocery
store, one sunny afternoon.
I want you to picture this
little girl.
Suddenly, a truck races up.
Two men jump out and grab her.
Drag her into a nearby field...
and they tie her up.
And they rip her clothes from
her body.
Now they climb on.
First one, then the other.
Raping her.
Shattering everything innocent
and pure with a vicious thrust...
in a fog of drunken breath
and sweat.
And when they're done...
after they've killed her tiny
womb...
murdered any chance for her
to bear children...
to have life beyond her own...
they decide to use her for
target practice.
So, they start throwing full
beer cans at her.
They throw them so hard...
that it tears the flesh, all
the way to her bones.
Then they urinate on her.
Now comes the hanging.
They have a rope.
They tie a noose.
Imagine the noose coiling tight
around her neck...
and a sudden blinding jerk.
She's pulled into the air and
her feet and legs go kicking...
they don't find the ground.
The hanging branch...
isn't strong enough.
It snaps and she falls...
back to the earth.
So, they pick her up...
throw her in the back of the
truck...
drive out to Foggy Creek Bridge...
pitch her over the edge.
And she drops some 30 feet down
to the creek bottom, below.
Can you see her?
Her raped...
beaten...
broken body...
soaked in their urine...
soaked in their semen...
soaked in her blood.
Left to die.
Can you see her?
I want you to picture...
that little girl.
Now imagine she's white.
The defense rests, Your Honor.
Innocent!
He's innocent!
Innocent!
He's innocent!
Hailey's innocent!
He's innocent!
We won!
We won!
Ellen, we won!
Aren't you happy?
Oh, my God, Ellen, you have
to be happy.
He's innocent.
Carl Lee is innocent.
He's coming home.
Jake.
That was...
that was...
Hey, I'm one of the bad guys,
remember?
Thank you.
Thanks.
Freddie Lee Cobb!
We got something to talk about.
Hastings...
you belong over there with
them.
Get over.
Congratulations, counselor.
Thank you.
You must be overwhelmed right
now.
Give me...
After you...
Yeah.
Was I good or what?
All right.
Here you go, girl.
Carl Lee... look.
What?
Well.
Hello.
Hi.
Hi there.
Hannah, this is Miss Hailey.
This is Hannah.
Hi.
Hi, Hannah. Ain't she so pretty?
Thank you.
Brought you some peach cobbler.
Oh, thank you.
Come on in.
Come in.
Howdy.
Hannah, this is my daughter,
Tonya.
Hi, Tonya.
Hi, nice to meet you, Hannah.
Just thought our kids could
play together.
