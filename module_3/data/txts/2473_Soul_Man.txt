<i>The soul man is recorded in
front of a live studio audience.</i>
Ooh, and baby,
we should've got that new car.
I looked good in it,
but you looked real good in it.
I did, didn't I?
You know, I'm just worried about
throwing a flashy car like that.
In front of
the congregation's face.
It won't be in their face.
It'll be in the parking lot.
Well, we really could use
that back-up camera. I mean,
You've killed like, six trash
cans since we moved here.
I could use that feature
in real life, too.
boop... Boop... Boop...
Come on, a little closer.
Turn a little left, toward me.
Easy, easy.
Aha!
Already home.
What y'all been doing?
I might ask you the same thing.
Practicing parking.
We went to
reverend J.C. Carpenter's.
Amazing traveling gospel show.
Well, you might as well just
stab me in the chest.
With a butter knife.
You know how I feel
about J.C. Carpenter.
He's nothing but a hustler
posing as a preacher man.
Hell, I knew him when he was
willie jay bell,
Singing backup in my band.
Well, now he makes billions as
a big-time mega-preacher.
Lyric, he doesn't
make billions.
He makes millions, with an "m."
There's a big difference.
How much did you pay to
see this scam artist, anyway?
Together? $350.
But we got this free shirt.
come on and
follow me and the lord.
Around the world! Come on!
Your shirt talk too?
See, this is exactly what
I'm talking about.
Has nothing to do with god,
it's all about him.
And if he was here,
I'd tell him that to his face.
Oh, actually, you're going to
get a chance to do that.
He said he wants to come by
the house and talk to you.
He speaks very highly
of you, daddy.
I I don't want that man...
I don't want that man
coming to our house!
He's going to do nothing but.
Rub my nose in the fact that
he's making billions.
You mean millions.
Come on, baby, let's face it.
The man makin' billions.
Come on and follow me and the
lord around the world!
Come on!

Hi, lolli. Where's boyce?
He's in the den.
You want me to get him?
No, no, I need to
speak to you in private.
I... I got a little
woman problem.
what's goin' on?
Well, you remember veronica,
The lady I met on
cougarswithtigers.Com?
I sure do.
Well, as you know,
I've been seeing her regularly.
For the past few weeks,
And it's gotten pretty serious.
I'm thinking about
taking it to the next level.
Aww, you really are a tiger!
Rawr!
Is J.C. Here yet?
Oh, hey, lyric!
Hey.
We'll, uh, finish our
conversation later.
Yes we will, tiger.
Don't ask.
Is that one of
your videos again?
Don't you ever get tired of
watching yourself, son?
I'm not watching myself,
I'm watching
the background singer.
Isn't that J.C. Carpenter?
Hm! You mean willie jay bell?
Look, I don't approve of J.C.
Any more than you do.
He's like the fast food
of preaching.
You drive through,
pay your money,
But get no nutritional value.
Yeah, with like,
3 billion suckers served.
Still, seem to me like you got.
A bad case of the envies.
Don't forget,
"a sound heart is
the life of the flesh:
But envy the rottenness
of the bones."
Proverbs 14:30.
Well, don't you forget that
"the love of money is
the root of all kinds of evil."
Do you really want to get into.
A scripture competition
with me, son?
No.
I was just kind of excited
I knew that one.
ooh! He's here! I'll get it!
Calm down, honey.
You don't want to seem
overanxious. I'll get it.
Boyce, how do I look?
Whoa, hello.
J.C. Carpenter is
about to arrive.
We need to secure the building.
Oh, well, uh... okay.
Are all y'all
staying for dinner?
I don't know if I
got enough corn.
You got to be kiddin' me.
This is a little
over the top, isn't it?
Sir, I need to know if we're
going to have an issue here.
We have an agitated male,
late 40s...
I'm not late 40s.
And short.
I am average height for a male.
It's okay, jim.
I know this guy.
What's up, B.B.!
Eric. What are you doing here?
Don't tell me you're
representing him.
Hey, I tried to get you to
sign with me for years,
But you wouldn't bite.
This turned out
a whole lot better, anyway.
We're all good here, sir.
Okay.
Let's bring him in.
Have mercy!
If it isn't
boyce "the voice" ballentine.
Come on over here
and gimme some love, man.
Willie jay. Man, how you doing?
Man, ain't nobody call me
willie jay in a long time.
Yeah, probably since you was
standing behind me on stage.
That's true, I did have some
humble beginnings, but uh,
How you like me now?
Lolli, hey baby.
How you doing,
you getting younger or what?
Oh, stop.
Unless you just want to
say it again.
Now, tell me this:
How does boyce get
a beautiful woman like you?
Come here, baby.
Security?
Lyric, now I see you guys
standing there together,
I realize you got
your mother's good looks.
Thank god.
mom, take a picture.
- got it.
Oh, my god. I am<i>so</i>
putting this on instagram.
Hi.
I'm reverend barton ballentine,
boyce's dad.
- How are you?
- And I just wanted to.
Ask you something. - Mm-hmm?
What are you?
Whoa, whoa, daddy.
What denomination?
Methodist? Baptist?
Pentecostal?
Love.
Have mercy.
Hey, boss? We should get going.
You got a book signing
at the convention center,
A mass baptism at busch stadium.
And then dinner with oprah.
Give me a minute, eric,
I want to enjoy this family.
Now, if I recall correctly,
you like cigars, don't you?
Yeah, I partake of a stogie
every now and then.
Mmhmm, well, check this out.
I just happen to have.
A couple of cohibas
from havana.
Aren't those illegal?
And like, 20 grand a box?
Well, you know,
I counseled fidel.
You got somewhere
around this lovely house.
To smoke these things?
Yeah, we can go out
on my patio.
Patio. That's cute.
So, what time
we need to be ready.
To head on over to Oprah's?
Mmm! Oh, man.
That is good, brother.
Yes, that's a breath of heaven
right there.
You remember, we used to.
Smoke cigars like this
all the time.
The first time we sang.
<i>Spankin' ain't just for kids,</i>
in memphis.
Oh, most definitely,
I remember my part.
♪ Spank it ♪ spank it
♪ a spankin' ain't just
for kids, girl ♪
Sometimes a man got to do
what a man got to do.
Man got to do it, man.
Man, ain't it weird the way
things worked out for us?
I mean, uh, you being a
small-town preacher,
And me being the preacher.
Well, I mean,
You did blow up pretty fast.
Yes I did, have mercy.
Can I ask you a question?
Well, man, you just gave me
a $400 cigar.
Ask away.
What do you think about
the work I do?
You put on a good show.
But that's all it is,
is a show, right?
That's what you're saying?
Well, I mean...
No, no, no, you're
absolutely right, boyce.
That's what I love
about you, man,
You say what you mean.
I started out with good
intentions,
But somewhere along the line,
it just kind of.
Spiraled out of control
for me. I mean,
I'm counseling
obama at the moment.
You counseling obama?
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
And he loves these, too.
Boyce,
Can I be willie jay bell
for a moment?
Of course, man.
Brother, I am lost.
Willie,
You know, maybe you just need to
take a step back from all this.
And just see what you're
doing out there.
Wait.
Are you suggesting that I quit?
I I didn't say that.
You know what?
You're absolutely right.
That's exactly what I'ma do.
I'ma do exactly what you said.
Wwhat... what'd I say?
You just told me to quit,
and I'm gonna do just that.
Mm! Mm, mm.
Boyce, you are
a persuasive man,
Have mercy.
I'm not that persuasive.
You can ask my wife.
Hey,
You ever kill a man
with your bare hands?
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
I'm not allowed to discuss that.
But yes.
Good.
I need you to open this jar.
Good people!
Gather 'round, I got an
announcement I want to make.
After a long conversation with.
My good friend
boyce ballentine here,
He's convinced me of something.
I'm going to hang up my robe,
I'm giving up the ministry.
Come on now, I didn't say
anything like...
No, no, J.C. Carpenter is.
Going back to willie jay bell.
Have mercy.
What did you say to him?
Daddy, how could you? Uhh!
I didn't do nothin' but
have a cigar with the man.
Eric, I know that I'm
letting you down,
But I can't face
these people anymore.
I... I can't take
no more of their money.
But I can.
You gotta leave this house.
You can't ask me to leave
someone else's house.
But I can.
Let's go.
So, if you're going to need
someone to represent you.
During this
transitional period,
I'd like to recommend someone.
His name is stamps ballentine.
But that's you.
Pleased to meet you.
Stamps, that's enough,
all right?
He's got a lot
on his mind right now.
Go on.
So what you
gonna do now, willie?
Lolli, baby,
What's for dinner?
Okay, all right,
see now, that...
That's gonna be enough of you
calling my wife "baby," okay?
I said, get the truck off
my grass, that's what I said!
What is going on out there?
Some idiot leaked to the news
that J.C. Is staying here.
And thinking about quitting.
It's like, six news vans
out there,
All trying to take a picture.
Are the news trucks here yet?
I got three shots of J.C.
Taking a nap.
Look at him, sleeping like
a little angel.
Gimme that.
You are not selling these.
Why you want to take away
my livelihood, brah?
Did you see this?
Aw, he gonna
stretch my shirt out.
Pop, what you doing
sitting in here by yourself?
None o' your business, boy.
You still nervous about
kissing that woman, huh?
If you must know,
I've only kissed one woman
in the last 35 years.
Oh, wow. Mom, right?
No, a whore in korea.
Who'd you think
I was talking about?
Now would you go,
so I can talk to lolli?
Hey, lolli.
Can I, uh, speak to you
in private for a minute?
I'll be right there.
What's that all about?
What would you say if
someone told you they were.
Thinking about taking their
relationship to another level?
I would say they're
thinking about having sex.
Then your daddy is
thinking about having sex.
- What?
- Yeah.
And he asked me to be his
sexual advisor.
So, what are you gonna
tell him?
I don't know.
In my old life, I would've said
incense, wine, and candles.
But I'm the first lady
of a church now,
So, I've got to be careful
with this.
The man is 70 years old.
Why does he need to
have sex anyway?
When you're 70,
you better want to have sex.

Hey, so I just left
veronica's place.
And I think she's getting kind
of impatient with me.
She's definitely ready
for this.
Well, you are
a very attractive man.
Thanks.
All right, here's the thing.
You really gotta make sure you
think this through,
'cause this is
a very serious step.
Okay.
You gotta make sure you're
100% ready for this.
There is one problem.
Lately, I've been
a little chapped.
What exactly are we
talking about here?
I'm talking about
a little kiss.
What'd you think
I was talking about?
I thought you was
talking about having sex.
Sex?
You got a dirty mind
for a first lady.
I just got the gig,
gimme a chance.
All right,
kissing I can handle.
You're gonna need
incense, wine, and candles.
Ooh, and this.
Some chapstick.
This'll make your lips
nice and soft.
Veronica will be lucky
to get a kiss out of you.
You think I should
wait for an opening?
Hell no!
Go in full tilt,
she'll love it.
I'm gonna do it.
Go get 'em, tiger!
Over here, mr. Ballentine!
Oh, get out of my way!
I gotta go kiss somebody.
Hey willie, I see you up.
Are those my pajamas?
Yeah. You need some new
fabric softener, too.
Look at all them
out there, man.
Just waiting on me
to make a statement.
Everybody want a piece of
J.C., boyce.
What I'ma do with
the rest of my life?
Have you ever thought about
asking the lord?
Well, no. I hadn't really
talked to him much lately,
Because, you know, ever since I
started making so much money.
And remixed the bible on tape.
Yeah, I can see how that
would've ticked him off.
You know what?
I may not ever
hear from him again.
Now, you gotta remember,
he is a forgiving god.
"If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just
and will forgive us."
That's 1 john 1:9.
That's impressive.
You know what? You really are
a good preacher.
Yeah, that's two in one day.
I'm actually on a roll.
Well, look at you go.
You the real deal, rev.
I bet your sermons touch
people's lives, don't they?
Oh, I don't know.
Yes, they are
pretty inspirational.
You know, we actually got
24 new members
since I started preaching.
- Is that right?
- Yeah.
Well, I got about
400,000 followers on twitter.
- Really?
- But what does that mean?
I'm not a real preacher.
You're a real preacher.
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna
come and hear you Sunday.
I want you to make an
announcement for me, saying,
"J. C. Carpenter's
amazing gospel traveling show
"is being shut down."
Matter of fact, I'm gonna
tweet it right now.
Uhnow, I don't think
that's a good idea.
It's too late,
I just tweeted it.
Look, my church only holds
150 people.
You just told 400,000
you would be there.
Well, you gonna have to
get some more chairs.
Ohho, it is packed out there!
I can't wait to do my thing.
Oh yeah. The church
is at capacity.
Actually, a little bit over.
I gave the fire marshal
a little taste.
Good thinking, stamps.
Stamps, why are you
in charge of this?
Are you gonna job-block me
for the rest of my life?
How many of my flock has
gathered on the lawn?
Aw, there's at least
1,000 people out there.
Now, we got a big screen set up
for everyone to watch.
Your reaction
to boyce's sermon.
Willie, can I talk to you
for a sec?
Now, for someone who's thinking
about quitting,
You seem to really be
enjoying this.
No, I'm just savoring the last
few moments of my limelight.
That's all. That's all.
You sure you want to quit?
Now, I've read
some of your tweets,
And there's a lot of people
that count on you.
Yeah, they count on me,
but I don't know nothin'.
I mean, I just be
making it up as I go along.
I don't know.
I think maybe you just got
caught up in the show.
And forgot to give god
the shine.
But now that you know this,
maybe you can do a better job.
I'm going to have to ask you
to stop harassing my client.
I'm gonna ask you to sit down
before I harass you.
Willie, if you can quit
being a preacher, then quit.
But if you can't,
you've been called.
I could quit.
All right,
I'ma go tell everybody.
We're on the move.
Stamps, why are you
talking into your sleeve?
'Cause that's how we do.
Hi, veronica.
So, how'd it go
last night, tiger?
Just fine.
Amen, amen.
Amen, amen.
Now, I know that a lot of you
came here to see J.C. Carpenter.
- Yes!
- Yeah!
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but he won't be here.
- Aw!
- Oh!
J.C. Is at a crossroads.
See, one road
that he could follow.
Leads him to fame, money,
and the limelight,
While the other leads him to...
I'm gonna take that first road!
- Oh!
- Whoo!
Hello, everybody! I am back!
Now, looky here.
It's taken a real preacher
to help <i>the</i> preacher.
Find his way again.
- All right, all right!
- Yeah!
Well, welcome back
to the mountaintop, brother.
Thank you. I'll take it over
from here, okay?
Not in my church, you can't.
I could never quit preaching.
I tried and I tried,
but it's like,
It's like a fire
shut up in my bones.
And if you feel that fire let me
hear you say "yeah!" -yeah!
Well, I don't you feel the fire.
I don't think you see the light!
Because you don't feel the spirit
in me that make me want to dance!
<i>Yeah! I feel the love.
I feel the love!</i>
<i>I feel this power.
I feel this power.</i>
<i>Running through every part of me.</i>
<i>I feel the love.
I feel the love!</i>
<i>I feel this power.
I feel this power.</i>
<i>Running through every part of me.
Yeah!</i>
<i>You save your soul.
You save your soul.</i>
<i>And my spirit - And my spirit.</i>
<i>Set my spirit free!</i>
<i>I feel the love.
I feel the love!</i>
<i>I feel this power.
I feel this power</i>
