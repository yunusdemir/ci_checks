I understand we wish
to leave, Mr. Clarke.
We feel confident enough
to leave.
- Is that so?
- That's about it.
Have we considered the matter
carefully enough?
Are we ready
for the return journey?
That's what we think.
And you want it confirmed...
by a professional opinion?
Such a sensible approach.
Especially when we've been
such a perfect guest.
A prize exhibit amongst
all the sacred...
and profane remains.
How badly do we need
that first drink, Mr. Clarke?
We don't.
just a cigarette.
We are aware, of course,
how revealing your answer was.
We didn't hesitate. We knew
the question was going to be asked...
and we had our answer
all ready.
But it doesn't matter.
That part of it
doesn't matter.
Of course, even perfect
guests return...
to the scene of the crime,
as they say.
The crime being recovery.
An alcoholic
is his own informer.
The personal choice
we can take care of.
But don't hurry. I think we
should stay a few more days.
Be sure.
Take some, uh...
massage.
Get the young one.
She can't massage...
but she has
perfect breasts.
What are you looking at?
I keep seeing a shadow,
like a hawk.
I thought I saw a seagull
the other day. It worried me.
Probably my wife
has sent a hawk...
with a camera
strapped to its leg...
to photograph me.
U-2.
I what?
Those American planes...
That's what they're called, isn't it?
I'm Cuba.
I'm her Cuba,
and she's my Bay of Pigs.
What's her name?
Mrs. Salinas.
No, the... the young one.
The young masseuse.
Oh, no idea.
Don't worry about her name.
just lie face upwards.
Mr. Clarke? Excuse me.
- Were you expecting a visitor?
- A visitor? No. No.
Oh. The lady seemed
to think you'd see her.
What lady?
"Fe Carbonell Rodriguez
de Moreau."
- Young or old?
- Young, sir.
Well, the name alone is worth
the price of admission.
We, uh, haven't met,
I don't think.
- No, we haven't.
- Oh.
I didn't think so.
But you asked to see me.
Yes.
I understand you're leaving
here shortly, Mr. Clarke.
Well, I don't intend to
take up permanent residence.
I have a suggestion to make about
your employment when you leave here.
Oh, I see. You're a sort
of social worker, are you?
Alcoholics Anonymous
or something like that?
No, nothing like that.
I'm talking about work,
Mr. Clarke.
I am in the same line
of business as you are.
You're sure you're not thinking
about somebody else?
I don't run
any kind of business.
You... take things,
don't you?
Take things?
Certain things.
Oh.
I'm sorry. It's a bit
of a shock, I know...
to have a complete stranger come in
and tell you what your life's all about.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm fairly shockproof.
I can be dropped from a height
without damage.
It's just that I am not really
dressed for confidences.
Why don't I put some clothes on
and meet you outside?
I never feel very confidential
in waiting rooms.
I'll be as quick as I can.
All right.
Let's assume that I do take things.
Now, uh, what do I take?
I take photographs, say.
How's that?
- Beautiful photographs.
- Oh, naturally.
You have a photograph
I can sell for you.
- You're sure of that?
- Quite sure.
Sure that I have it,
or sure you can sell it?
- Both.
- Ah.
Well, that's very good so far.
Then we need your help
in taking more photographs.
"We"? Who's "we"?
My husband and I.
Oh, it's a family business,
is it?
Well, you see, I've always been
very happy taking snaps by myself.
- There'd be a three-way split.
- How generous.
You mean you'd let me keep a third
of what I've already got...
if I've got it?
Well, that's very generous.
You ever thought of
taking it up seriously?
I'm being serious,
Mr. Clarke.
You know,
I have to apologize to you.
I'm not the photographer
you think I am.
I'm just a British drunk
taking the cure.
It affects some of us
this way.
It's called
withdrawal symptoms.
May I come and see you
again on Sunday...
when you've had the time
to think it over?
Sunday? Why not?
That's fine.
Sunday's always
a dull day around here.
They don't even let us
have Communion wine, you see.
You are going out soon, aren't you?
I'm thinking about it.
- Tell me that joke again.
- Which one?
That about, um, happiness.
Oh. What's the good of happiness
when you can't buy money with it?
- That's very funny.
- Yeah.
It's even funnier
from where you're sitting.
Oh, somebody told me
a joke this morning.
I had a visitor, you know.
A captain of police.
He told me a joke
I'd heard before...
but it's still
one of my favorites.
Somebody tried to rob
one of my houses again.
That's... That's the joke,
is it?
Yes. It's a very
private joke.
Yeah, they're
the best kind.
It doesn't worry you...
being robbed?
I'm never robbed.
But if I was, why should it worry me?
One worries about wives,
not what's in the safe.
It's what's outside the safe
you worry about.
That's a really
very funny remark.
They found the man
this morning.
He got nothing, of course.
They found him dead on the beach.
- Drowned.
- They say that's the nicest death.
- Who? Who says that?
- People who haven't been drowned.
Excuse me.
I thought perhaps we could share
the remainder of the journey together.
You're full of good turns,
aren't you?
And here I was...
thinking I'd done
all the right things.
I even took the slow train.
People escaping
usually make a dash for it.
You forget, Mr. Clarke.
We are birds of a feather.
- Are you a bad sleeper in trains?
- No, I am just a bad sleeper.
Well, that's a point
in your favor.
Women who sleep easily
are usually bitches.
Have you got one of these?
Fantastic invention.
One-minute color prints.
That's all it takes.
Don't ask me how.
It's all fully automatic,
of course.
Why do we have to
go on pretending, Mr. Clarke?
Henry. How do you spell
your first name, by the way?
F-E, with an accent.
Yeah. It doesn't suit you.
- You weren't ever a nurse, were you?
- Nurse? No.
I mean, I think
you're more of a Catherine.
And I've always wanted to meet
a nurse called Catherine...
ever since I read
A Farewell to Arms.
- Did you ever read Hemingway?
- Yes.
Well, you remember
Lieutenant Henry then.
He met this girl called Catherine,
and they had this very romantic affair.
I was in a hospital once...
during the blitz...
but it wasn't the same
as Hemingway.
All the nurses
had mustaches.
I think we're nearly there.
Oh, good.
Say "cheese."
Who is it?
I'm in the bath.
Put it under the door.
I believe I'm keeping
an appointment in Samarra.
Don't put it like that, please.
I'm such an admirer of yours.
Do come in.
You know my wife, of course.
Yes.
You might want
to burn this.
- Not one of my better efforts.
- Thank you.
- Yes?
- Yes, thank you.
- And?
- Just water, no ice.
Even in this climate.
How very British of you.
- To the core.
- However you take it...
I don't think the good
Dr. Delgado would approve.
Still, that's in the past.
We're not drinking to that.
- What are we drinking to?
- I think to the happy thought...
that you haven't made a mistake
in coming here to meet us.
Of course,
you're a difficult man to get to meet.
Not difficult enough
it seems.
We all like the thrill of the chase,
don't we?
No, as a matter of fact.
Personally, I think it's overrated.
But I'm here,
so what's the proposition?
This isn't a shakedown, Henry.
May I call you Henry?
- Nothing as crude as that.
- Good.
- So, what is it?
- Just a discussion.
Darling, can I have my drink?
just a friendly discussion between three
people who share... or could share...
certain common interests.
Of course, I must admit that
we have a slight edge on you.
We've studied, uh,
your career very closely...
whereas, possibly,
our own isn't quite so familiar to you.
- Would you like me to be more specific?
- Why not?
It's a long way to come
for gossip.
Well, specifically...
and not to alarm you,
we know that you got...
the much-publicized
Carnival stones.
You stole them
quite brilliantly, I thought...
and you haven't yet
disposed of them.
Well, we have a customer for you.
A very safe, reliable customer...
who likes to be satisfied
with the better things in life.
He also pays promptly.
Altogether a very
splendid character.
- He's in the market at $30,000 American.
- Which market is that?
He does most of his shopping in Tangiers.
The air there agrees with him.
That's the proposition.
Excuse me.
Now, what's the bait?
"Bait"? That's rather
a crude word, isn't it?
About as crude
as sending your wife.
As you will. All right.
I'll put it in one word..."Salinas. "
You see, I've been in the removals
business a long time now.
Too long, perhaps. I still have the
brains, but I don't have the legs.
- So I want some help.
- And it has to be me.
- It has to be the best, Henry.
- What makes you think I'll take the bait?
Do have your drink. It must be coming
up to the boil in your hands.
It kills the germs.
Well, I imagine anybody
who'd go to the lengths...
of becoming a temporary alcoholic
just to get near a man...
might be tempted to nibble.
I could've saved you
the time and trouble...
to say nothing of
Delgado's exorbitant fees.
I know all there is to know
about Salinas.
I've built up my files over a number
of years with great care.
I may not have your flashes of genius,
Henry, but I am thorough.
I can also afford
to be choosy.
Why don't you buy yourself
a gold watch and retire?
That's a lot to lose.
We're hoping it'll be more
by the time retirement comes.
Of course, if one
is thinking of retirement...
it's convenient to find someone
else to take the rap...
as the vulgarians say, just to
make sure of being left in peace.
I know I'm not wrong about you, Henry.
You have such a quick mind.
I don't blame you for being suspicious.
I'd feel the same in your place.
What do you think, Fe?
I think you're talking too much
philosophy and not enough business.
We don't want to rush Mr. Clarke, do we?
We just want to...
stop him running
and think things over.
That's okay.
Save your legs.
Well, is he for us?
Yes, he's for us, all right.
Not for me, I grant you.
You were right there.
But definitely for us.
He interests you,
doesn't he?
If you say so.
Attracts you, even?
I don't often
find a man attractive...
as you know.
Oh, somebody... said you...
I don't know who it was.
Somebody.
Somebody told me
you'd been in hospital.
It wasn't a hospital.
It was a rest home.
God, that's where I ought to be.
- What reminded me of that?
- Nothing.
- I gave you that card.
- Oh, yes, yes.
You gave me a card, yes.
What?
- Who is she?
- Ah, yes, the card.
Aw, come on, Fillmore.
Get the old computer working.
Come on.
Tick, tick, tick.
Carbonell. Carbonell.
- Married. Married, uh...
- Moreau.
- What do I think he's doing?
- Yes.
I mean, it's been a week.
It's been a whole bloody week.
We drink to it... the great partnership-
and then nothing.
- What's he doing?
- What I should be doing in his place...
asking questions.
But who is Carbonell?
"Was." Under the sod, old love.
Went to the funeral.
- Who was he then?
- Oh, foreign ministry.
Nothing big. Quite a power
behind the scenes, I believe.
A Hitler fan, I think,
during the old krieg.
- What about Moreau?
- Ah, yes.
Now, hold on, love.
Moreau, yes.
Uh, yes. Come on, come on.
Yes, it's all happening.
Uh, Vichy Frenchman. That's it.
Got out of it in '43.
Came down here to meet the pals.
I have an idea old Carbonell
was one of 'em.
- You mean he was a politician?
- Good Lord, no, no.
I have an idea...
Sure. I have an idea...
he was something to do
with the old polizei.
just tell me one thing. What makes you
think I'd be happier with the two of you?
Perhaps because you haven't
had the choice before.
My dear, you don't get what you want
by understanding people.
- It helps.
- Not really.
- It helps.
- Not really.
You get what you want
by willpower, mostly.
And nothing weakens willpower so much
as the effort to understand.
If that's him,
he's timed it rather well.
- Moreau?
- Anyway, happiness isn't everything.
- Hello?
- One has to have love as well.
Hello?
Funny he sends you
all the time.
Both times he's sent you.
- Is he bent, by the way?
- "Bent"?
Your husband.
Is he queer?
- I didn't know it was so obvious.
- I didn't say it was obvious.
You don't like queers,
is that it?
I don't have to.
I'm not married to one.
- How long have you been?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- Six years.
Oh, that's a life sentence.
- Has he ever been to prison?
- No.
- I don't think so.
- I have.
In England.
It's still the best place
to go to prison, I'm told.
You think about them.
That's the trouble.
- You think about them all the time.
- Yes, I suppose you do.
Not women.
You didn't think I meant women,
did you? I meant these.
I saw her wearin' 'em once...
at a charity ball
for thalidomide children.
She was a fat little woman...
with a fat little neck.
A kind of blasphemy, really.
Some men in prison
think about women.
Even fat little women
with fat, ugly necks.
But women change when you're inside.
These don't.
- Please.
- What?
- Put them away.
- They're for you.
That's right, isn't it?
That's what we're meeting here for.
- But don't show them here.
- Why not?
Girls get offered
all sorts of things over lunch.
Not things as recognizable
as diamonds.
Nobody recognizes diamonds.
Not one in a million.
Not even the people who own 'em.
How funny you didn't know that.
- He didn't. Did you notice?
- Didn't what?
The waiter.
He didn't hover.
They always say
that waiters hover.
- Do they?
- Yeah. In novels and that.
The thing is, why did...
- What's his name... your husband?
- Richard.
Richard.
Why did Richard send you?
Are you thrown in with the deal?
It'd be nice to know.
Because if you're not...
what are we gonna do about him?
They're afraid...
nine times out of 1 0.
They don't even think of them
as being beautiful.
They just take
somebody else's word for it...
in the same way they take
somebody else's word...
that they're valuable.
All they know is they've got hold of
something they don't really understand...
so they're afraid.
So they bury them away in dark
safes and blue velvet boxes...
and wear replicas
made of paste.
Then they're happy.
With paste,
they know exactly where they are.
Wouldn't you...
Wouldn't you agree, Henry?
Uh, yes, I suppose so.
I'm not all that hot
on psychiatry.
What else do psychiatrists do
that we don't do?
We listen to people, don't we?
Find out what their worries are...
how much money they have,
how well they sleep at night...
what servants they keep.
- I hope you find this hot enough.
- Thank you.
Whether they're fond of dogs...
what time of day they receive their
lovers, if they have lovers.
All these intimate details
and others.
Then one night, we come along
with our little scalpels...
and cut away
their neuroses painlessly.
Has anyone ever used that
as a defense in court?
Darling.
Well, how else would you
account for the fact...
that the jewel thief
is the one kind of criminal...
that a lot of respectable people
seem to sympathize with?
As a philosopher,
how do you account for that?
I'd say, if anything,
it's just the Robin Hood element.
- Depriving the rich to help the poor.
- The poor?
- I'm poor.
- Not for long, Henry.
You are, I take it,
coming in with us?
I'm, uh, warming to the idea.
- I like simple arrangements.
- Wunderbar!
Two Alsatians, four maids...
a cook, chauffeur
and three gardeners.
The house is about 60 yards
from the wall.
- Got a shot of the wall?
- Uh, yes.
You'll have to get me over.
But once over,
the gardens should give adequate cover.
Do you have a side
elevation of the house?
Yes, I think so.
Ah, there we are.
Dodgy.
Very dodgy.
It's old.
See that? That's where
the mortar's crumbling.
- Is it climbable?
- Well, anything's climbable.
But you get hold of that stuff,
and it'll come away in your hands.
Anyway, let's work backwards.
Where are you saying
I ought to get in?
Well, I thought here.
- And what is that?
- One of the secondary bathrooms.
- Is it wired?
- They're all wired.
- That one's on the old circuit.
- How good is the wiring?
The new stuff's very good.
It was put in three years ago.
Well, what do you think?
I've seen worse.
Not much worse, I admit.
Get me a really
close shot of that.
Let me ask you something.
Why this one anyway?
Let me ask you something.
Why this one anyway?
It's messy
and it's average.
I don't like being tried out on something that
has all the risks and none of the glamour.
There's no question
of trying you out.
Then why do we have to
mess about?
The original deal
was after Tangiers, Salinas.
- That was it!
- Let me talk.
Let's talk about Salinas.
In the first place,
why the obsession?
Why not?
Why climb Everest?
Because it's there.
Yes, well, uh, that's fair enough.
- What's the joke?
- Oh, just my sense of humor.
There's always something faintly ludicrous,
don't you think, about two grown men...
talking blandly
about a robbery?
Yeah. It's a game.
Salinas enjoys it too.
He said so.
The counterplotting.
The fun isn't all on our side.
That's the point.
There's no fun on our side.
Three attempts in the last 1 8 months...
all failures.
He didn't even make
an insurance claim.
No, he's had all the laughs.
Yeah. I heard him.
That's why I
want to get him.
- You said you had the key.
- I didn't say that.
You implied it.
We're not ready for Salinas,
you and I, Henry.
We've got to know each other a lot better
before we contemplate a suicide pact.
It's always a mistake,
don't you think...
to jump into bed with somebody
too quickly?
I haven't had too many
failures in bed.
Well, you're more lucky
than most.
Perhaps that's why I picked you...
because you're lucky.
They go to Paris every
year, always at the end of this month.
They never leave before the 2 4th
or later than the 30th.
Day before they go, she gets the stuff
out of deposit at the bank.
So, next week is the operative one.
Twenty-eighth. That's right.
That's what you said, wasn't it?
That's the night of the concert.
They leave a day later.
She's acknowledged two tickets,
sent a check.
And the concert
starts at 8.;00.
Yes, I know. I've got tickets myself.
Pity about that.
- Anything else?
- How good's the safe?
Twelve years old, French.
Should open just by blowing on it.
Well, we'll just have to get you over
the wall with breath to spare.
- You're sure about the other thing?
- What other thing?
The knockout pills.
Dogs can be
a hell of a time waster.
I promise you. We used them
with great effect in the war.
Well, I hope you're right.
I was never happy about dogs.
- Any particular reason?
- Yes.
I used to work
for my living once.
I did a paper route.
What?
He's changed it.
This thing's brand-new.
Come on. Come on!
Come on!
Nada! Nada!
It's too good for me. I could spend
a whole week and still get nowhere.
- We'll bust it then.
- Impossible. Look at it.
- A drill is hopeless.
- We'll dig it out then.
We'll dig it out, take it
with us and bust it later.
How can we?
We've got this far.
We're not stopping now.
Believe me,
it's just not possible.
Get back in the car,
and tell Fe to bring it round the side.
Take the tools with you,
and the overcoat.
Give me 1 0 minutes. If I'm not
there by then, leave without me.
Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
Get the gate!
Shut the gate!
Good morning, my love.
How are we this beautiful morning?
In particular,
how is the patient?
Getting back to normal.
The normal man has yet to be found.
And when found, cured.
I'm sorry. I'm just
in a good mood.
- So I see.
- How is he?
I called a masseur for him.
He's in quite a bit of pain, of course.
- I have the perfect painkiller.
- You've opened it?
It had to be blown.
- And?
- It's all there and more.
- Much more.
- How much more?
Well, it appears
our client...
has been trying to cover himself
against further risks of inflation.
- Ask me how much.
- How much?
Well, something to
the tune of...
well, I put it around,
uh, 30 million pesetas.
- But that's fantastic.
- Quite fantastic.
At current rates,
it should translate into something...
well, not far short
of half a million dollars.
It's too much.
In the normal course
of events, yes.
It might mean trouble.
I agree.
Curious enough,
the way things are now...
I don't think he'll be
reporting the loss in full.
You may have noticed there's absolutely
nothing in the paper this morning.
- I don't think he can risk it, you see.
- Why not? How do you mean?
My dear, there are too many
people in the government...
who would like to know what he was doing
with 30 million pesetas worth of diamonds.
I think in his position,
it would take a lot of explaining away.
Really?
You really think so?
I'm sure of it.
It all fits.
It justifies that
brand-new bastard of a safe.
How Henry got to it the car
is a miracle, but he did.
I just stood around
and watched.
All very galling
to the old ego.
He's younger than you,
that's all.
- Is it?
- Yes, of course.
The young always win
in the end, don't they?
Do they?
Do you want to go
and tell him the good news?
If you like.
Aren't you coming?
No. Go and tell him
the good news.
Tell him next week we'll go down to the
villa and reprieve ourselves by the sea.
Drive carefully.
Cigarette?
Merci.
Darling?
But didn't he come,
the masseur?
She. It was a she.
She came instead
of her husband, like you.
Mmm. Are you complaining?
I don't know yet, do I?
It remains to be seen.
Listen. I've got something
fantastic to tell you.
But what are you doing
standing up?
- You should be lying down.
- All right.
If you say so.
I've got something
to tell you.
- How much stuff do you think was there?
- No idea.
- You know what Richard thinks?
- Nobody knows what Richard thinks.
Richard thinks half a million dollars.
Isn't that simply fantastic?
I'll take you
instead of my share.
Oh, be impressed.
Please, be impressed.
I'm very impressed. I was impressed
the first time I saw you.
Your share will be nearly 200,000.
I think it's fantastic!
And I think it's fantastic too,
and I always will.
And I want you very much.
You're supposed
to be resting.
Anyway, I've got
something else to tell you.
- I bought you a present.
- What sort of present?
Come on and
I'll show you.
Come on. Come on.
You mustn't give men
presents.
- Where is it?
- In the street.
In the street?
Hey. Your hand's shaking.
Is that a criticism of my driving?
My hand's shaking because
you've been holding it.
It's a criticism
of your handholding.
Well, in the back row at a cinema,
you could always tell.
What are you talking about?
If you did the ultimate,
you know, held a girl's hand...
either she called the manager
or she was your date.
There isn't a manager
to call.
I know. That's why
I brought you here.
Come on.
I feel like a tourist.
Do you really like it?
- I'll take it on one condition.
- What's that?
You let me spread
the payments.
I never accepts gifts
from married women.
Before the war,
my old dad wanted a car.
They only cost about
a hundred pounds then.
But he did it
the hard way.
He saved up
cigarette coupons.
I think he needed
about 20,000.
So, he smoked himself stupid.
And by the time
he got up to 1 5,000...
the war came, they stopped
the coupons and a bomb got him.
There's a moral in that
somewhere.
What did you mean
when you said you were despised?
What made you think
of that suddenly?
Well, I remembered,
that's all.
Who despised you?
Your parents?
Not my parents.
My father.
Are you an only child?
Or maybe he wanted a boy.
I don't know what he wanted,
except power.
He liked the war, I think.
At least he seemed happy
when the war came.
I've never understood men
who have to have a son.
All this business about
carrying on the line.
I don't wanna
perpetuate me.
I do.
- Let's go straight to the villa.
- What about Richard?
We'll send him a telegram
when we get there.
He won't like it.
He doesn't have to like it.
He's a philosopher.
Have you done it very
often in strange rooms...
with girls
who have husbands?
That's my problem,
not yours.
I was hoping...
Before, I was hoping
it wouldn't be any good.
Everything would have been
so much easier.
Is that what you were
thinking too?
Sort of.
I was thinking in the book...
she came to an unhappy end.
What book? Who?
The nurse... Catherine.
But there was something
in between, wasn't there?
Between the meeting
and the unhappy end.
Yeah. About 300 pages.
This is
an extraordinary place.
I can't make out the geography of it.
Usually I can photograph
a house just like that.
Here. I got something for you.
Hold out your hand.
Your watch.
I not only don't take gifts from married
women, I don't give them either.
Leave him.
Would you ever
leave him?
I don't mean divorce.
I know you wouldn't do that.
I just mean...
leave him.
I know what you meant.
I can't. Darling,
he isn't a rival.
He sleeps with you,
doesn't he?
We have separate beds.
We always have.
You're the first thing he sees
when he wakes up in the morning.
- I hate him just for that.
- You shouldn't.
I know I shouldn't.
It's unreasonable...
it's petty,
and it's dirty.
But if I don't hate him...
I'll start pitying him.
Then I'm lost.
But why do you have
to do either?
We don't have to
change anything.
We can all be together
until...
Until he's dead?
Yes. Until he's dead.
What if I don't like that?
If I ask you to choose?
Don't ask me.
Because if I have to choose...
even though I love you,
I'd have to choose him.
- Well, you don't have to.
- Yes, I have to.
It's so easy for you,
isn't it?
You don't have to go to somebody you
love and say, "I'm leaving you."
I'm married to him.
It's not love
like you and me...
but it is love.
And I'm married to him.
No one can insure love forever,
not even Lloyds.
I couldn't do anything
to hurt him while he's still alive.
- And this doesn't, I suppose?
- No.
You don't believe that.
I believe it.
It's not all that out of the ordinary.
The world is full of wives
who cheat on their husbands.
Darling, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay.
Being in love...
needs practice...
like everything else.
Hey.
Hey.
We're just out of practice.
Temperaments later.
- Are you cross?
- Why should I be cross?
I've had a very
pleasant journey.
Isn't he staying?
Yes and no.
He's very religious, this man.
He prefers it
in the hotel.
Is he nice?
He looks nice.
Well, his driving's an improvement
on previous models.
- I hope he's nice.
- Yes. His ideas are rather derivative.
I'd rather suspect he'll be wanting me
to buy him a car for himself very soon.
What do you suggest, an E-type?
I hope the real owner
enjoys driving it.
- I'm glad you're not cross.
- Why on earth should I be cross?
It's nice to smell the sea air again.
Much nicer than
the smell of money.
I must arrange some outings
for you younger set.
They have some very good parties here
during the summer. Very good parties.
Except for this mania the rich
have of putting on fancy dress.
I always found that
rather tiresome.
I can never think
what to wear.
- What do you usually go as?
- Oh, the noblest Roman of them all.
Yes, I must... I must
get some invitations.
It'd be nice for Fe to have somebody
to dance with for a change.
Why did you marry her?
That's a very good question,
Henry. It deserves an answer.
If I told you the real reason, you
wouldn't think it was a reason at all.
One day I'll tell you.
Meantime, we must both wait.
You don't like waiting.
I do.
Well, that's just the luck
of the game.
What game's that?
The one we've all come
here to play.
Excuse me for a moment, Henry. As older
residents, we have to pay certain respects.
Help yourself to what you want.
It's all laid on.
Hello.
Oh, you don't
remember me, do you?
No, but I'm sure
I should.
No, you shouldn't. It's just that I've
got this incredible memory for cars.
I remember cars, and
then I put a face to 'em.
Oh, really?
What do you remember most,
radiators or rear number plates?
You know, that's good. That's a very
sexy joke. I must use that.
Um, look. Do you mind
if I sort of join you?
By all means. Would you
like one of these?
- No, thanks. I've given them up.
- Yeah, you're probably right.
How 'bout a drink?
Um...
Look. I'm not on my own.
I am with somebody.
I'm with the, uh... oh, dear...
the count something or another.
- Oh, lovely.
- Last month in Escorial.
- What about it?
- That's when I saw you.
You were a red Flouride
with Madrid plates.
- Only rented, I'm afraid. Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Well, you stared at me.
- Yes.
Well, I'm still staring.
I don't know what
I've come as, really.
It was the count's idea. He chose it.
He got it out of some book.
He's always showing me books.
The point is, you see,
I'm trying to get into films.
Oh. You're an actress,
are you?
Oh, no. No, I'm trying
to get into films.
Oh, Lord.
He's out again.
Look. Could you ask me
to dance?
Please, just once round the floor?
Then you can dump me.
just so as I'm out of his range.
He doesn't see too well.
Oh, look.
Do you see who that is?
Over my left shoulder
in the alcove there.
You know who it is,
don't you? It's that, um...
Oh, what's her name?
She's in films.
Hey, what's her secret?
- I mean, did you see her last film?
- I didn't see her first film.
How does she do it?
Well, I imagine she's
met the right people.
- That's the Salinas table.
- Who?
He's very much
your cup of tea.
He's crashed three Bentley Continentals
in the last nine months alone.
- But has he anything to do with films?
- No.
He's just rich enough to keep you out
of them. Come on. I'll introduce you.
I don't think our good
Dr. Delgado would approve.
Henry. My dear friend Henry.
Come and take the cure.
No, I can't stay.
I'm with some people.
I'd just like to introduce you
to a great little car enthusiast.
I said, what was she like...
the girl before me?
Uh, she was blonde,
which you're not.
She was English,
which you're not.
And she was too aware,
just like you.
But I wasn't thinking
about her.
- Do you wanna know what I was thinking?
- Mmm.
I found a photograph in a book
in your place in Madrid.
Richard in a uniform
with the boys of the old brigade.
And I was thinking,
maybe that was it.
When a policeman comes over
to the other side...
he comes all the way.
Love... that's what people
never understand...
when they talk about queers.
They always leave out love.
When he first told me,
I didn't understand either.
Not that part of it.
He was police in the war...
but not what you thought,
not Gestapo.
just worked
alongside them.
There were safes in the Gestapo offices
full of confiscated jewelry.
And this boy...
this boy raided one
of the offices one night.
And Richard caught him.
But instead of
turning him over...
they worked together.
Richard had
the information...
and the boy
did the work.
They cleaned out the safes
in town after town.
There were papers,
reports and things as well.
The papers went
to the Resistance...
and the jewelry
they kept to themselves.
They were heroes
to some people.
But the Germans
had to stop it.
They had to catch
the thief.
So they put all
their best men on to it.
And the best man of all...
was Richard.
So- So Richard
caught him again.
The boy was caught
one night.
And the next morning
they shot him.
He said...
Richard said...
that when he did it, he thought
the boy would tell everything...
and they'd die together.
But, you see...
Richard forgot love too.
And the boy told nothing.
He just let himself be shot.
That's why I married Richard.
He needed someone
to forgive him.
Fe?
Fe?
Richard?
Fe not here?
Hello, Henry.
No, she's not.
Where's she gone?
She gone out with Tony?
Tony went shopping
on his own.
That one's always nicer
when he's had a day spending money.
What? Wait a minute.
I'll come down.
She didn't tell me
she was going out.
Where has she gone then?
Well, unless the boat didn't sail,
she's on her way to Tangier.
You bastard.
No, no, not entirely...
but I can see why you would jump
to that conclusion.
- It was her decision.
- Why didn't I know about it?
- Presumably, that was her decision too.
- You know how dangerous it is?
We don't need the money that urgently.
You could've stopped her.
Why should I?
I'm a poor husband in many respects...
but I know when not
to advise my wife.
She's got a will of her own,
as no doubt you're aware.
- But you knew.
- Oh, yes, I knew.
Married people don't
have many secrets.
That's both a curse
and a blessing.
just hope that nothing
happens to her...
for your sake.
For all our sakes,
Henry.
Get rid of him.
I beg
your pardon?
I want him out of the way
while I talk to you.
As you wish, Henry.
Well, now, Henry...
am I going to be solicited
or merely lectured?
- You know what we've got to talk about.
- Not particularly, I don't.
There's a wide range of subjects we
could cover. Shall we have a drink first?
- I don't need a drink.
- I'm sure I will.
So I'll help myself now.
Right. Where do you
want to start?
I want you to divorce her.
I'll supply all
the evidence you need.
I'm sure. How very conventional
of you, Henry.
You disappoint me.
You can have all the
money from the last job.
You really disappoint me.
What is it, Henry?
Middle-class morality?
It's out of character
to be outraged.
You're a thief, Henry,
a long way from home, as you said.
Thieves mustn't
get outraged.
In any case, people only
barter for things they want.
Well, I don't want a divorce.
I don't want your money.
Your wife
doesn't love you.
- She loves me.
- Don't let's talk about love.
Let's talk about people
sleeping with people...
adultery and other
middle-class sports.
And being queer?
Let's not leave that out.
I wondered when you
would get around to that.
You're not in love.
You're just shocked.
Tell me something
I don't know.
- She pities you.
- Does she?
Well, perhaps she does.
There are worse things in marriage.
Is that what she said?
- Pity isn't love.
- But is that what she said?
She told me about the boy...
the boy who died.
The boy you killed.
I suppose if she slept with you,
she had the right...
to tell you about that too.
It was a long time ago,
Henry.
After the first death,
you learn to live with the others.
What do you expect me
to say?
I'm sorry the facts
of my life upset you?
Perhaps you'll pity me
too, Henry.
Not pity. That's not
the word I'd use.
No, of course not. Pity's not manly.
We're talking about manly things.
Right. Let's talk about the subject you're
so expert on. Let's talk about love.
No. Let's talk about Fe leaving you...
about you letting her go.
But does she want to go?
We haven't established that.
- She'd come with me if you'd let her.
- But on whose terms, Henry?
- Mine or yours?
- I don't care which.
You might.
You easily might.
You can't be sure that she's told you
everything about me.
She's told me
all I need to know.
Well, let's see,
shall we?
Did she tell you
about the rest of my life?
No, and it's
not important.
You're so positive, Henry. I envy you.
It must be a great comfort.
I've never had
that particular gift...
where my life is concerned.
When I first came
to Spain...
after the events
that shock you so much...
I tried to fall in love.
Your kind of love.
I tried to fall in love
with women...
a woman.
I wanted to find salvation...
forgiveness.
They're words, Henry.
just words.
just words.
I didn't succeed.
To betray oneself, one
usually has to betray others.
The woman was
my best friend's wife.
Carbonell's wife.
You destroyed him too then?
- Well, I wouldn't quite say that.
- He died.
Oh, yes, he died.
And he left you
as Fe's legal guardian?
He wasn't a very intelligent man, but he
understood the forces of destruction.
Fe hated him.
- Yes, I know.
- But did she tell you why?
No, but I guessed.
But you didn't guess right,
did you, Henry?
And she didn't tell you.
Guess again.
You're so nearly there.
You have the courage.
I've seen you let go
and fall before now.
I wasn't a very good lover...
but I was good enough.
She isn't Carbonell's
daughter.
She's mine.
Salinas has one of these
in his bedside table.
At night, he employs a guard.
The guard carries another.
It's all in the file.
Take them both.
It's what you came for
in the first place.
I wouldn't like you
to go away empty-handed.
Killing you now...
would be too easy.
Oh, believe me,
it's never easy.
I could do it...
now without thinking.
But perhaps that's
what you want.
A nice quick end to pity.
Someone to do it for you
20 years too late.
Isn't that what
it's all been for?
- Why you sent her away?
- Well, that's one answer.
Yes...
but it's too good
for you.
I don't want you
to be safe.
You haven't got to the end
of pity yet.
If I were to kill you now...
you'd win... hands down.
She wouldn't be able
to despise a dead man.
All you can do with the dead
is forget them.
- You're not cold?
- No, I'm fine.
Good.
I wanted you to see
my house at night.
Oh, it's fabulous!
Yes, it's a very pretty effect
with all the lights on.
If I'm lucky enough to break into films,
which everybody says I should...
- Oh, you should.
- Do you really think so?
- If you mix with the right people.
- One of the things...
I'd like to do, I'd like to have the
most sensational house of my own.
The best time to see this house
is when all the gardens are flood-lit.
The trouble is no one pays very much
attention to detail nowadays.
The snag is houses, like people, need
to be kept in a state of preservation.
Tony?
No, it's me.
Nice surprise?
Yes. Did something
go wrong?
No. Why should it? It all went so well,
there was nothing to stay for.
So I took a plane back.
What are you sitting there
in the dark for? Where's Henry?
- Has he gone to bed?
- No.
Oh. Where is he then?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?
What's happened?
Something's happened,
hasn't it, since I went away?
Tell me.
That's paper
you're burning.
Yes, I'm destroying
all my files.
The partnership's dissolved.
Richard, look at me.
You must have said something.
He wouldn't just go like that.
- Tell me what happened. Where is he?
- I don't know.
Yes, you do. You're lying.
I always know when you're lying.
I don't know where he is,
but he's gone to take Salinas.
You must have made him then.
You want him to die.
You said something.
You said something
about him and me.
Why would I do that?
I know nothing about you and him.
I simply told him the
truth about you and me.
You told him what?
What truth?
The point is he's not coming back.
So why concern yourself?
Let us just say he doesn't want
to share you. Leave it at that.
Richard, what truth?
I don't understand
anything you're saying.
Leave it. Leave it.
It's all over!
Richard, stop treating me like
a child and tell me the truth.
I must know.
Must you?
Yes, please.
I told him...
the reason you went away is...
I told him...
you're my daughter.
It's... It's a joke,
isn't it?
It's some terrible joke.
I don't know yet.
But then, how could you
say such a lie?
Richard, why?
It wasn't necessary.
Yes.
It wasn't necessary.
Such a horrible lie.
No... lie.
Yes.
Yes. Yes.
Yes! Yes!
Oh, he's kinky.
Hasn't he got
sweet little ears?
I used to have a teddy bear in my room.
I just couldn't get to sleep without him.
A habit you've
grown out of, I expect.
What's that for?
- What's that, darling?
- That thing behind you.
Oh, that. That's to make
sure you don't get out.
- If you tried to escape now, bells ring.
- Oh.
Well, as long as the bed's not wired.
What goes on in here?
Oh, the usual offices.
Pow! How usual
can you get?
Is this wired too?
No, there's just the
master switch by the bed.
For the master.
How do you work this thing?
- What?
- Well, I don't want it to be too hot.
How is that?
Lovely.
Mmm.
Oh, I know what
I wanted to tell you.
What's that, my darling?
That, um... What's his name?
Um, Barbaro.
Barbudo.
Well, what about him?
He made a pass at me
in the restaurant under the table...
- With you sitting there.
- So?
He showed great taste.
Come along.
Well...
I don't think
it was very nice.
After all, you were
paying for the meal.
I shall get even.
I shall humiliate him
tomorrow at tennis...
in front of his wife.
Well, I don't think it's very nice.
I don't think any
of it's very nice.
What... What is it?
Bloody light's fused.
Maybe it's just
the bulb.
It wouldn't be just the bulb,
would it? They've all gone.
Never mind.
I love you just as much
in the dark.
It's all in the file.
All in the file.
Somebody told me a joke this morning.
I had a visitor, you know.
A captain of police.
He told me a joke
I'd heard before...
but it's still
one of my favorites.
Somebody tried to rob
one of my houses.
Tried to rob
one of my houses.
It's a very private joke...
because he got nothing,
of course.
I'm never robbed.
But if I was,
why should it worry me?
It's what's outside the safe
one worries about.
Let's talk about Salinas.
Let's talk about him.
In the first place,
why the obsession?
We're not ready for Salinas,
you and I, Henry.
Not ready for him.
It's too early for a suicide
pact, Henry. Too early.
She told me about the boy.
One of the advantages
of being rich...
is that you can play games
with other people.
The boy you killed...
Play games with other people.
Darling!
No!
