Sancta Maria
Mater dei
Ora pro nobis
[Singing continues]
[Laughing]
[Dogs barking]
SAILOR: Where are you?
YOUNG WOMAN: Here.
SAILOR: This your house?
What, are you crazy?
What about your folks?
-What about your dad?
-He's at work.
And your ma?
Hey, what about your mother?
My mother's dead.
SAILOR: Do you like that?
Yes.
WOMAN: Hala?
SAILOR: Who's that?
HALA: Mama.
SAILOR: I thought she was dead!
She was.
[Laughing]
Got a smoke?
MAN: Halczia!
HALA: Shit!
MAN: Wake up! I don't bake all
night so that you sleep all day!
HALA: OK, you go first.
[Coughs]
Jadzia!
Halczia!
[Sighs]
Where is everybody?
Witek!
-[Baby crying]
-Come on! Step on it, Sofie!
Mama hates to be late!
Don't dangle him
like that, Ziggy!
Mama!
Kaz! Witek!
Where is my breakfast?
ZIGGY: Mama!
ZIGGY: Mama!
MAMA: Hold your horses, Ziggy.
Don't hang me out to dry.
Take this kid off my hands.
Close that door!
''Mama, Mama, Mama.''
Where is your wife? I'm not
the only mom around here.
[Baby shrieking]
Ohh...poor child.
What kind of parents you have!
And a Gypsy for a mother.
[Burps]
[Baby crying]
This is your job.
Good morning, husband.
Wife.
How was your meeting last night?
What meeting?
Your ladies' meeting.
Like always.
Oh, Mother of God.
You're blowing smoke
in the baby's face.
HALA: Mama, can't Ziggy
take care of his bundle of joy?
ZIGGY: No, Ziggy can't.
You heard Mama. That's your job.
Even high school dropouts
can't sleep all day.
Who would've taken care of him
if I hadn't dropped out, huh?
Huh? Huh? That's what
high school dropouts talk like.
Good morning, Sofie.
You look pale. Maybe baby?
I hope not. Isn't one enough?
Why no more babies, Ziggy?
What's the matter with her?
I want some grandchildren.
You've got one.
One.
[Laughs] One.
Hey! Can't you get him
to quit crying?
He can't stop crying. He just
realized you're his father.
[Whistle blowing]
Come on, let's go.
Hey, what?
Just leave me alone.
[Ziggy grunts]
Come on, what is this?
Hey, Ziggy. Full day now.
Yeah.
Oh, Jesus. I'm tired already.
[Whistle blowing]
WOMAN: Hey, Bolciu, when
do you get your beauty sleep?
Wouldn't you like to know, dear?
How I love this place.
What a coffee shop.
A man can really breathe here.
Sitting at the counter,
enjoying a good cup of coffee.
Sometimes, Halczia,
at home, I feel...
I feel so...
Halczia, when one day
you go look for a man,
look for a man like me, hmm?
Hey, Piotrusz. Have you
ever seen such a beauty? Hmm?
She is her mother's daughter.
I look at my wife,
and I look at myself,
and I say to myself,
''How did two such ugly trolls
give birth to such a Venus?''
And Venus' mother--how is she?
How is she? Good question.
Smart question.
How is she? Hmm.
She's...she's OK.
Nothing special, you know.
A woman.
She certainly is.
And a woman is born to be
both more and less than a man.
She must be above him...
and beneath him.
I'm a good baker.
I bake good bread.
She makes babies, I make bread.
That's no small thing, you know.
Excuse us, ladies.
We don't exist for them.
Like they're something special,
something better.
We exist for them.
We exist to clean their toilets.
[Yawns]
You and I are
sensitive creatures, my lamb.
Yes, Daddy,
we're sensitive creatures.
Yes.
[Groans]
And sensitive creatures
need to be protected.
[Sighs]
What are they doing in there?
-[Toilet flushes]
-Be patient.
That's where they cut
the really big deals.
[Door opens]
It's getting late.
You go home to your baby.
I'll finish up.
Thanks, Mama.
-Where did I put...ah.
-[Jingling]
[Whistling]
[Humming]
You know I don't smoke.
I envy your willpower.
[Humming]
You are a queen, Miss Jadwiga.
I know.
Everything about you
is dark, Roman.
Dark eyes...dark soul...
you are a Gypsy.
Not a Gypsy, Miss Jadwiga...
but a Jew.
Mrs. Jadwiga.
As you like. Now off,
before you break my back.
I'll break your back.
Jadwiga?
Mama's working late.
Mmm !
Mmm.
[Sighs]
[Clears throat]
Hard day at work, Mama?
Why do you ask?
-It's late.
-So it is.
Where is Hala?
Taking a bath.
[Laughing]
[Car approaching]
[Siren]
-Looking for trouble?
-You should be in bed, Schuster.
HALA: You won't bum
any beer off us.
Yeah, get your own.
Break it up,
or I'll card every one of youse.
[Starts engine]
What the hell is going on here?
Why is everybody trying
to foul up my good mood?
JADZIA: Who's fouling you up?
-Everybody.
-Ohh...
[Knocking on door]
-Morning, Mr. P.
-This is the pinnacle.
-Is someone under arrest?
-Not exactly, Mrs. P.
I was hoping to catch one
of your sons, Witek or Kaz.
Around? They're fast asleep.
Yeah, I guess
it is kind of early.
I just finished a double shift.
I'm still wired.
You should be on your last legs.
I got a second wind.
Can I come in?
You should be on your last legs.
He got a second wind.
[Sighs]
God damn it.
Pass me that hose, Kaz.
When you're finished, I've got
a few other things I need done.
She's got a few other things.
Witek, watch what you're doing.
Last time
you cleaned the gutters,
your dead leaves
killed my garden.
Who will help me
fluke the dumplings?
''Not me,'' said the fox.
-Witek?
-Mamusia...
KAZ: Said the skunk.
Later, Mama, I promise.
Baloney.
I need some hands here now.
Mamusia moya.
You're a bad egg, Witek.
Still need help, Mrs. P?
I do. Come in and clean up.
And put some clothes on--
all of you.
-''Need help, Mrs. P?''
-Hey!
Go home and fluke
your own dumplings.
Have you any brothers
and sisters?
-I got a brother.
-One brother?
-There's just two of you?
-Yeah, just us two.
Two children.
What's the point of that?
You wouldn't bake
just two cookies, would you?
Hmm.
-What's that stuff?
-Czarmina soup.
-Duck's blood soup.
-Duck's blood?
Only our mother and sister eat
it. They lap it up like milk.
You don't want any.
HALA: Maybe he does. Have some.
Mmm. Have some.
Mmm.
[Jadzia giggles]
Mmm.
[Schuster clears throat]
[All giggling]
Last Sunday, the priest took
names for the Virgin's festival.
I gave him Hala's name.
Maybe you lead the procession
this year.
What I don't get is,
how does the priest know?
JADZIA: Know what?
If a girl's...you know.
How does he know she's a virgin?
JADZIA: He can tell.
How?
Same way you can tell
if anyone's a virgin.
By looking.
Where?
In the eyes.
It's in the eyes.
[Jadzia giggling]
WITEK: Virgin!
[All laughing]
-Without a doubt.
-Fuck you. I'm not a virgin.
Freeze!
You're a very bad girl.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? You scared me!
I'll protect you.
-I thought you'd never come out.
-Scram, you jerk.
Walk with me.
Why?
Let's go before they see us.
Where are we going?
Wherever our legs take us.
I'm walking with you
because I trust you.
-I can trust you, can't I?
-I'm your guard.
And the one to guard against.
-Mama...
-Mama can't help you.
If you run, I'll chase you.
I'll have to.
Be bold.
I'm not unbold.
How bold are you?
Bold.
Show me.
Be bolder.
Bolder.
Now...how bold are you?
Why'd you stop?
Get going.
Go on, go home.
[Crunching]
-[Door opens]
-Hala?
Halina...is that you?
You're not smoking in there,
I hope.
Oh, Ma.
Have a pickle.
[Sofie crying upstairs]
ZIGGY: It's not the end
of the world, Sofie!
SOFIE: Not for you.
No, you're right.
It'll give you nightmares.
Before concluding mass today,
I have the pleasure...
of announcing the girl chosen
to lead the procession...
in this year's
Festival of the Virgin.
This year's procession
of the Virgin will be led by...
Stanley Mislinski.
Mislinski?! He can't be!
The procession will be led
by Hala Pszoniak.
Of course, we all know that to
lead a Virgin's procession...
is a high
and solemn privilege...
reserved for one who embodies
all we prize in womanly virtue.
Innocence, chastity, and purity.
-The Lord be with you.
-And also with you.
May AImighty God bless you.
The Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.
ALL: Amen.
Go in peace to serve the Lord.
ALL: Thanks be to God.
Come to me.
Kiss my hand.
Don't hate me.
My foot...kiss it.
[Giggles] Stop!
No. Not unless I say.
Now you may kiss me.
Don't stop.
Oh, Hala, I can't stop.
[Horn honks]
MAN: Schuster! Come on!
We're late! Let's go!
[Raising shades]
[Door shuts]
Mama!
Why is everything spinning
around and around?
Childbirth is
a straightforward thing.
Well, I'm glad it was
just a false alarm.
Don't be like that, Mama.
You know what a hard time
Sofie had with our last one.
I've never had any trouble.
Except when I brought Halczia
into this world.
Jesus and Mary,
did I suffer then.
I gave birth right there
on that couch.
My sons and husband
were eating dinner.
I said, ''Don't bother
yourselves about me.
''How are the pirogis?''
Then I screamed...
and had my baby.
After Little Ziggy was born...
I couldn't walk for two months.
They cut me open.
Still have the scar.
I have given birth seven times.
Five of my babies lived.
Four of them are boys. Men.
They'll have families,
and one day...
I'll have more grandchildren
than I can count.
This is my house.
These are my sons.
This is my husband, my bread,
my table, my kitchen. Mine!
[Door slams]
Sofie knows what's best
for her and me.
Sofie! What does
that Gypsy know?
-I'm Syrian.
-Same difference.
Certain things are not even
for you to decide.
You cannot come between
a husband and wife...
between man and God.
To hell with man and God.
Halczia...it's positive.
Who are you, the angel Gabriel?
[Baby crying]
Ziggy, the baby's crying!
ZIGGY: Let him cry!
Shh. Please stop crying.
Please, please,
please stop crying.
[Music plays]
Shh.
[Coughing]
Please, please...be quiet!
[Jadzia sighs]
Looking for this?
Let's see...it's my night off,
and we know what that means.
Another meeting of the Polish
Ladies' Auxiliary League.
Only I'd like to know what
these meetings are auxiliary to.
Jesus and Mary,
it's stuffy in here.
I can't breathe.
Oh...for God's sake.
Bolek, help me. I need you.
-Do you mean that?
-Mean what?
-That you need me.
-Bolek!
Jadwiga...
where are you going tonight?
You really want to know?
If you do...
I'll tell you.
Shh.
Your husband...might hear you.
ROMAN: Nothing in the world
could induce me...
to put any part of my body
into that disgusting substance.
JADZIA: It's just water.
Theoretically.
Hey.
Ohh...unh!
[Snaps fingers]
Is the lady in one of her moods?
How are your children?
Each one a worse egg
than the last.
But one thing I can say:
I made them.
Who do you think he would
look like...our son?
Don't laugh. I'm serious.
Oh!
I'll be giving you
no babies, Roman.
That's not why I've come here.
Ja.
Children ravaged my body.
No wonder my husband
stopped looking at me.
How did you meet him?
I was...15 years old.
Fifteen years?
Jesus. My God.
A woman like you...
It was your mistake
to marry him.
-Mistake?
-Mm-hmm.
Oh, no. Marrying my husband
was no mistake.
I had my reason
for marrying him.
Oh, yes...there was a reason.
Only I can't remember
what it is.
OK.
Shall we, Miss Jadwiga?
Mrs. Jadwiga.
Daddy?
Alone in the dark?
This is your night off.
Want to watch TV?
Oh, good God, no. I'm keeping
busy right here. Thank you.
You're waiting for her,
aren't you?
You wait for her like a dog.
Don't we all wait...
like dogs...
for someone?
That's what we do. We wait.
Anyway...where should I go?
Hmm? If I were free?
Who would feed me?
[Door closes]
[Snoring]
[Jadzia snoring]
Aah!
What is it?
Did you have a bad dream?
You speared me with your
toenails. They're like daggers!
One dozen, at this time of year?
You Polacks are
extravagant ones.
Yes. My wife adores peaches.
Hmm. Cheating on her, are you?
Six dollars, 75 cents.
Six dollars and 75...
I have to stop at the butcher's.
You better take a few off.
They're juicy.
She won't be disappointed.
Ah.
[Sighs]
One dollar and a quarter.
I'll take it.
Be good, Bolek.
[Whistling]
Where's my ham?
Can you imagine, my love?
The butcher closed
just as I got there.
You can't be serious!
[Sighs]
Halczia...
one of these days, you're going
to get us both in hot water.
In the beginning,
there was a lump of dough.
You and I...dough.
Until the master bread maker
himself...
with his own two hands,
gave us shape.
First he made man,
and out of man's body...woman.
After man. Why after?
She was an improvement.
Man was simple, basic...
a pumpernickel.
But woman...was like...
a light and airy Easter chalka.
How could a woman
come out of a man?
It had to be
the other way around.
In the beginning,
there was a woman.
-A woman who...
-Hey.
Hey...what is all this?
Is there something wrong,
my little lamb? Hmm?
My clock stopped.
Your what stopped?
My clock...stopped.
Your clock stopped.
Can't you get a new one?
No. Not that kind of clock.
Every woman has a...
[Sighs]
kind of clock...
that she tells
her time by, Daddy.
What are you saying, Halczia?
Are you, uh...
Are you in trouble?
No.
You're not crying, are you?
I never cry.
That's my girl.
Whatever it is...
push it down.
Push it right back down...
to where it came from.
That's what I do.
[Sighs]
You see? I feel better already.
[Distant thunder]
CUSTOMER: Thank you.
What do you mean
by sneaking out at night?
You let her do whatever she
wants--run the streets. Why not?
Jadwiga, not here.
It's embarrassing.
Embarrassing? For who?
I'm not embarrassed!
-For Halczia.
-Halczia. You mean for yourself!
[Locks door]
[Sighs]
Gypsy!
Don't hit me, Mama.
You'll hurt me or my baby.
Your baby?
I'm gonna have a baby.
She'll be beautiful.
[Sighs]
How could this happen
to my daughter?
Our daughter.
[Little Ziggy crying]
That boy will never marry her.
He'll marry her.
[Knock on door]
Mama, I have to get up
in a few hours.
I can't put him to sleep.
Give him to me. Go to bed.
[Crying]
[Stops crying]
[Chuckling]
Why didn't you want
to marry me?
I was scared.
I was just a scared kid.
What were you scared of?
Life.
The life that came
spilling out of you.
I didn't want to make a mistake.
I didn't want my life
to be built upon a mistake.
And besides...
you never really loved me.
Seeds fly to where
the wind blows them.
Once that happened...
we needed each other
to be complete.
Here.
This is what married us.
Don't you believe in anything
more important than yourself?
Your religion, God?
[Crying]
Nothing on Earth is more sacred
to me than this.
Making life...and love.
That's my religion.
You ready?
Why is your sister
taking so long?
Mama, aren't you going to make
a confession, too?
We haven't got all year.
Someday, Mama,
you're going to go...
What makes you so sure
I'm not going...
[Hala laughing]
You be here early Sunday.
Don't let me down, Halina.
-I won't, Father.
-OK?
Did you tell him?
Oh, you didn't tell him.
Hala.
Hala.
You're the disgrace
of this family.
You can't march
in the Virgin's procession.
I want to. I was chosen.
Would you give this up?
Don't ask stupid questions.
You're not a child anymore.
-Everything's changed.
-No!
[Sighs]
-I look like a corpse.
-That's my wedding dress.
There is no turning back
now, Gypsy.
Sofie's doing you a favor.
This is the dress she married
your brother Ziggy in.
I hope it brings you my luck.
Oh, Christ, it's cursed.
Come look at yourself.
SOFIE:
Ah, look at her, the bride.
It's your wedding.
SOFIE: Yeah, drink it.
You'll need it.
SOFIE: Oh, Hala.
You poor, wild little thing.
You didn't know a man
would tame you.
JADZIA: Don't make me laugh.
Men don't tame women.
Nature is what tames women.
SOFIE: Oh...
JADZIA: Women don't need men.
It's just that wherever
there's a woman,
by God, there's a family.
And the family without a man
is usually a catastrophe.
Speak for yourself, Mama...
because I need my Ziggy.
Ha ha ha!
Your Ziggy.
Ha ha!
Mmm ! I want to propose a toast.
To my firstborn baby...
because without him,
Ziggy wouldn't have married me.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
JADZIA: And here's
to Ziggy himself.
SOFIE: Mmm !
My firstborn.
God knows, without him,
Bolek never would've married me.
[Jadzia and Sofie laughing]
ALL: Cheers.
JADZIA: Oh!
To your first baby, Halina.
May God bless it.
And don't come back
until you're married.
Or as good as.
[Church bells ring]
[People talking]
Russell!
-Who are you?
-Who are you?
Who am I?
You think you can prance in here
with that white dress of yours?
This is my house, Skinny.
Who are you, what do you want?
I got business with Russell.
MAN: Oh, a tough girl, huh?
What kind of business?
None of your beeswax.
WOMAN: What's going on?
What's all the shouting about?
Oh, look, Bob.
It's a girl in a white dress.
Well, aren't you smart.
[Motorcycle engine]
There he is!
[Dog barking]
Hey!
Russell...
Hala...
I'm going to have a baby.
Yeah.
I figured as much.
Just blow in their ear.
They say that
about Polack girls.
But with you, Hala...
Jesus.
All I did was look at you.
Will you marry me?
-[Thud]
-Yes!
Yes?
No. Not a chance.
But...you loved me.
You said so.
Hala, quit playing with my head.
I'm not ready for a family.
-Am I?
-Girls are always ready.
-Ready and waiting.
-Waiting, yes, like dogs.
There's so much I gotta do.
I'm saving money to buy a car
so some guys and--
What's the matter?
In my head, I can just see
all those dirty diapers.
Piles and piles,
mountains of them.
See what I mean?
It's a life term.
Wouldn't you rather be free?
Free?
You're so pretty, Hala.
There's just something
about you.
You're so dang pretty.
What do you want me to do?
Whatever it is...
I'll do it.
Is this what you came for?
-This is what you want.
-Yes.
This is all I want from you.
Just don't stop.
Don't ever stop.
[Clank]
[Dog barking]
JADZIA: Hala?
Hala?
[Window slams shut]
[Scratching on screen]
It's almost midnight.
Where were you?
-With a boy.
-What boy?
-A bad boy.
-What were you doing?
Screwing.
Cigarette.
Since you know who...
you wanna know how?
Like there's no tomorrow.
Because...
there is no tomorrow.
Not for me.
[Knock on window]
BO Y: Now we've had it.
It's Daddy!
BOLEK: Don't just stand there.
Help me.
Oh, fuck.
JADZIA: What's going on
down there?
Is that you, Hala?
BO Y: Nothing, Mom. Just me!
[Door slams]
[Door opens]
My queen.
Like it?
Oh, yes.
You have kicked sand in my face.
You've kicked sand in my face.
Oh, oh, my love.
[Otchi Tchernye plays]
Ha! ha!
Oh!
Oh, Jadwiga.
How did all this happen?
Don't blame me.
You put on the Gypsy music.
You know what I mean.
Wait. I have a surprise for you.
Give me your hands.
Paris?
France, my queen.
I'm taking you away with me
for a little while on business.
But I have no business
in France.
Ha! Good God!
I'm talking about France.
We'll see the Eiffel Tower.
Stroll along the Champs Elysees.
Is it so much better
than Detroit?
For God's sake.
Roman Krull wants you
to go with him to Paris.
But I don't want to go.
You don't want to go with me?
What do you want?
Do you want to stay
a cleaning woman? Huh?
Yes. You are a cleaning woman.
I'm a queen.
I have five children.
Four of them are boys, men.
I have my own house, a husband.
What do you have?
I am a queen.
ROMAN: If you are a queen...
then why are you here?
I'm sorry.
OK?
I didn't mean...
[Sighs]
Take some blinis.
No, don't be sorry.
I'm a cleaning woman.
That's what I am.
[Clears throat]
My stockings.
Mother in Heaven, why am I here?
Muniu, Piotrusz,
Kazium, everybody!
Muniu, on the double.
Your mama needs you.
-What's wrong, Mama?
-Your sister is in trouble...
and that rascal
who did it to her...
thinks he's getting off
scot-free.
KAZ: Nobody gets off scot-free
in this house!
WITEK: Who did it, mama?
The Schuster boy.
Schuster!
I'll kill that bastard!
Ooh! Ah, shit.
-What's this?
-Come on out, Schuster!
BOB: It's some kind of posse.
Send that good-for-nothing
son of yours out here!
My son's an upstanding citizen,
a policeman.
There's only one thing
upstanding on his body.
-But we'll take care of that.
-Yeah!
My daughter's in a family way,
and he's responsible.
So your daughter...
Skinny little tough one, huh?
Now we're getting to
the bottom of this.
Like mother,
like daughter.
You're a rascal who's
given birth to a rascal!
Muniu, break the door down.
No, you don't!
[Woman screaming]
Daddy, Mama needs you.
She can take care of herself.
She doesn't need me.
I'm telling you, Daddy,
she needs you bad!
BOB: I don't know
about you Polish people...
but this isn't how
we do things around here!
BOLEK: We'll see about that!
We'll see about that!
BOB: He's got a rolling pin!
-Mr. P!
-I'll give you Mr. P!
You--you usurper!
You destroyer of families!
Get away! Halczia!
[Russell groaning]
HALA:
Daddy, please let go of him !
You can't force me!
-Let go of him !
-Halczia! Halczia!
Let me go. Let go!
You! You!
You!
You shameless...
Shameless!
Come back here!
[Dog barking]
What have you done to me?
Looking for this?
JADZIA: Ahem.
Ahem.
What?
Jadwiga...
What?
Tell me.
Fine.
Big, tough lady. Be on your own.
-You drive me crazy.
-You drive me crazy, too.
You've been driving me
crazy for years.
I hate you.
I hate you, too.
[Voices shouting]
[Bells ringing]
JADWIGA:
I was looking for you.
Have a seat, Ma.
Pirogis.
Those are beautiful.
What? No pickles?
I really love your pickles,
but...pass.
What about you, Bolek?
Actually, Jadwiga...
I despise pickles.
Oh, well, I'll have some.
All these pickles.
So many.
Suddenly,
just to look at them...
fills me with sadness.
Maybe we don't need
so many pickles.
Halczia...
go to church with your brothers.
We will meet you
at the procession.
[Bells ring]
I'm leaving.
I said I'm leaving.
-Good. My family would kill you.
-Hey.
Come with me.
Come with you?
How can I come with you?
Things are different.
Everything's changed.
Don't tell me
you're keeping this kid.
Don't worry. You're still free.
What's going on in
that head of yours?
I can't explain it to you.
What do you want from me?
Everything.
Hala!
Hala!

What a joke,
her crowning the Virgin.
She's pregnant!
A pregnant virgin!

Is this true?
This can't be true!

O Mother in Heaven,
tell me what to do.

I'm alone up here.
Help me.

Put this in your pipe
and smoke it!

Somebody get her down!
You!
