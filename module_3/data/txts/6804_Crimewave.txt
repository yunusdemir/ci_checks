AKA: Crimewave
...and so at midnight, just
12 minutes from now
mass murderer Victor
Ajax will be executed
at the Hudsucker
State Penitentiary.
Now it's Ajax's turn to die.
Ajax, a security system's repair
man gets death by electrocution.
Thus writing finis to the horrible
tale of murder and mayhem
that shocked our fair
city just 2 weeks ago.
Claiming innocence to the end,
but nothing can save Ajax now.
You...
No...
Sit down!
Wait... wait...
no... no... no...no!
Okay, Gout.
They just fried Gurwitz.
You're next, Ajax.
But I'm innocent.
Innocent, I tell ya.
Don't give them
the satisfaction.
Ajax!
Well, good luck, kid.
Give my regards to Gurwitz.
Come on pipsqueak, we're
saving a seat for ya!
Say, you look like a couple
of reasonable fellows and...
let me explain what's.. .
what's going on here.
I'm not supposed to be here!
It's all a big mistake.
There's no hard feelings on this end.
Mistakes do happen
and naturally I can
explain everything.
See, I only worked for
Mr. Odegard and Mr. Trend.
I was an employee in
their security shop
and Mr. Odegard wasn't
a very nice guy and...
Don't sit down, Vic!
I guess he was planning
to sell the shop right out
from under Mr. Trend's nose.
So tell me Odegard...
Do you L-O-V-E love it?
Could you die? Does it...
ah... trip your alarm?
Frankly, Renaldo, what
you do with this shop
after you've bought it doesn't
interest me in the least,
but let's keep this little
transaction to ourselves.
I wouldn't want my partner to
know he's losing his business.
Somehow, Mr. Trend must
have found out about it.
Mr. Trend wasn't such a bad guy,
but he and his wife had sunk
their whole lives into
that business and...and...
Mr. Trend would have done
anything for his wife....
anything.
Center City Exterminators...
Trend?
You there?
Little weasel...
Give me the word, come on, ya creep.
Do it tonight, he'll be
working late, alone...
and make it quick
I don't want him to suffer.
You hear that, Arthur?
He doesn't want him to suffer long!
Helene, I'll never let that
rat destroy our happiness.
You can count on it.
So, so you see...
I had no idea Mr. Trend
was up to something
nobody did, it was
between the two partners
I had nothing to do with it!
If you could only find
Nancy, she's my witness.
If you could only find her she'd
tell you I'm totally innocent.
She'd tell you the whole time I was
across the street from the shop
installing the video security system
in Mr. Trend's apartment building.
Mr. Trend!
Honey, I'm home.
Who is it?
It's me, Mr. Trend!
Oh... Hi, Vic.
What's on your mind?
Silliest damn thing,
it's a broom closet!
Well, one more camera...
Mr. Trend and it's...
back to the shop.
Fine, back to the...
You know Vic, I'm glad
we ran into each other
in this amusing fashion.
For a long time now I've been looking
to have a heart to heart with you.
You know you've always been
more than just an employee
to Helene and I.
Honey, I'm home.
You find this work
fulfilling, don't you, Vic?
And how, Mr. Trend!
But have you ever thought
about the grand design?
I mean, there's something
missing, isn't there, Vic?
A door, Mr. Trend?
What's behind the door, Vic?
Oh,... Oh...Jeez,...
Mr. Trend I'd love to have
a foyer, but on my salary...
a large apartment is...
I'm not talking about
the anteroom, Vic.
I'm talking about the
little princess inside.
Lord knows I'd do anything for Helene.
Don't go back to the shop.
Take the rest of the day off.
Tonight you go out and
find a little princess
that you'd do anything for.
Now you go out there
and find yours.
Oh, Thanks, Mr. Trend.
Just make sure that...
she knows who's boss.
Okey-dokey, Mr. Trend.
How are you tonight, Colonel?
Adequate!
Hell of a storm brewing.
Know how I can tell?
No, how?
Steel plate.. in my head.
Yes sir, Korea was no picnic.
Word of advice son,
when you hook up 4G.
Don't flirt with the
filly that lives there.
She'll slap you quicker than
you can say "present arms".
Yes sir, there's one woman
that can take care of herself...
All by herself...
All by...
Taking care of yourself.
That's important,
but two people
taking care of each other
that's romance...
Romance.
Let's see.
Chapter one: The Perfect Woman.
Of course the perfect woman is not
just gonna walk into my life, Gee...
Ohhooooooooo...
Holy moly!
Oh! my goodness,
are you okay?
Come on fuck,
get outta the road!
You maniacs!
Incredible, I've never
seen anything like that!
- Are you all right?
- Ah.. ha. oh..
Oh its.. oh, oh..
you've got the key... whoops.
One more thing, chode, don't
you EVER call me a maniac.
People gotta learn to
watch where I'm going.
Are you all right?
Yeah...
Are you all right?
Me? Yes.
Excuse me?
What?
Oh, I.. I.. thought
you... said something.
No.
Ah....
...you didn't?
Well...Thanks again.
Um! Would you...
Iike...to have...
some lunch some evening?
I'm sorry, No!
Ah, or a cup of coffee?
No, no, really.... I ah...
I'll pay.
No, that's not it...really...I...
Well look...
If you're not hungry...
maybe we could just chat.
Hey, hey!
I've got the rest of
the night off and...
Renaldo!
Hiya, cupcake.
Say, where were you?
I had to walk home from work.
Oh I... oh.. I ran into an
old army buddy and
I was detained.
Hi, I'm Vic.
Owww...!
Glad to know you.
Say, what the hell,
in the neighborhood
wadda you say
you and I go out and
drown a couple olives, huh?
Well, I don't know... you..
It's a date then.
8 o'clock Rialto Cafe, eh?
Well, okay!
Socially, the man's a genius.
I wonder if he's read this book?
- Bye Baby!
- Goodbye Renaldo, goodbye!
Jumping Jehosaphats.
In all my years in the city...
I ain't seen nothing like this...
...cheap Japanese umbrella...
I am so scared...
Come on Annie, let's go
inside, it's a hurricane!
My eye.
I'll sue you!
Holy Hanna, are you okay?
Jesus, I don't know.
Look out for the [pole]!
Did you see that?
Did you see that?
Helene, please come
away from the window.
Is that Mr. Odegard's
car down there?
Honey, this roast is
absolutely delicious.
Is Mr. Odegard
working late tonight?
No..
he went home..
to eat his dinner.
he was very hungry
and he went home.
Well, it looks like there's
a light on down there.
Helene, your food's getting cold.
He's still there, honey
and it's after 7 o'clock.
I didn't know you were
still there, honey.
I didn't know that Mr. Odegard
would be working late tonight.
Wait.... I think
somebody's with him.
I'm going down there!
Get away from that
fucking window!
I'm sorry.
I'll go down.
You can't go out in this...
terrible weather.
Don't call anybody.
I'll see what's going on.
Remember what I said.
I didn't expect him
in the shop tonight.
It's a complete surprise to me.
a total surprise...
and...
You'd like that,
wouldn't ya, baby?
A thousand guys would give a
thousand bucks to have dinner
with a girl like that.
Just look at that guy.
I'm not that kind of girl!
Well, with a little practice
you could learn to be.
Oh, now, now..
wait a minute, cupcake.
Nice tie!
Ooh! $76.
Okay, here's forty.
Oh, but then, I had the appetizer.
Call me a sport.
I'd call you a heel!
So I'm a heel.
So what of it?
Who are you?
Maybe I'm just a guy
who hates heels.
Maybe I'm a heel who hates
guys who hate heels.
Oh yeah?
Well maybe I'm a guy...
Oh...
ah...
Loser.
Oh, oh. The eye...
noodles.
Go on! Go on!
What in the living
hell am I doing here?
I oughta shove those
binoculars down your throat.
Jiminy Kripes, how'd I
ever get myself into this?
For cryin' out loud.
So long, partner...
Nobody makes a fool out
of Ernest Aloysius Trend.
Now everything's hunky-dory.
No witnesses.
Why, no, officer.
I couldn't say where he is.
Enemies?...
None that I knew of...
know of...
Yes...
Donald was very much beloved by all.
Of course, I'm sure he's all right.
Murdered?
Ernest, is everything all right?
Yeah, fine....
I'm at the shop.
Are you sure?
Odegard's gone... It looks like
he uses the back door for the...
Okay, then come on
home, honeykins...
your dinner's getting cold.
Ok, I'll be right home dear...
goodbye.
I used to think that
the key to happiness...
was the installation and repair
of small electrical appliances.
But...
well, I don't claim to know...
a whole lot about
the grand design
but lately I haven't been able to
shake the feeling that
something's missing
and I'm not talking about
the foyer or the anteroom.
Cherish is the word I use to describe
all the feelings that I have
hiding here for you inside.
I don't know how many times
I wish that I had told you.
I don't know how many times
I wish that I could hold you.
I don't know how many times...
I wish that I could mould
you into someone...
who could cherish me..
as much as I cherish you...
I haven't seen
you here before.
I like that in a woman.
You're cute.
Keep talking baby, maybe
you'll tell me something
I don't already know.
...I don't know how many times
I wish that I could hold you.
I don't how many times I wish...
Arthur...
For all we know, this is
the guy that hired us.
Tell him it's a two for one sale.
So, I guess what I'm trying to say is..
that the perfect woman is
is pretty much in the
eye of the beholder.
It's funny... just some
dames dig round chuck.
when they could
have prime rare.
Oh, you man you!
No one can be perfect
on their own.
Each person needs someone to
believe in them, to see them
as being someone special.
People shouldn't be afraid
to take care of each other.
Nancy...
today, when I saw you fall
all I wanted to do
was take care of you.
Hey!
He didn't...
Didn't you?
Foolish..
Whoa..
Ernest Aloysius Trend, what
on earth is keeping you?
Have a cab? You'll pay for that.
I don't want to break a hundred.
Take your bag, sir?
No muss, no fuss...
Leave the bagging to us.
Spies... above.
Lady, you ain't seen nothing...
YET!
Put up your dukes.
What mother son's raising
all that ruckus out here?
What's this?
Victor, you're a very nice guy
and I appreciate what you
tried to do for me tonight,
but this is one woman who
can take care of herself.
Let's have a big round of applause
for Johnny and the boys.
Vic, would you lend me $36?
Sure!
If I had $36...
I don't usually walk around
with that much money on me!
So where on earth am
I going to get $36?
Ladies and gentlemen!
The winners of tonight's Rialto
Dance Riot will receive $36!
Play, Johnny!
Woman found torn limb from
limb in West Side apartment....
Film at eleven.
Operator.
It's an emergency...
Oh, please... help me...
there's a man hitting... ah!
Well, ah.. you see.. my husband
went across the street... and... oh!
ah...ah...before that,
I'd seen Mr. Odegard.
I'd seen him working late and...
I'm going to tear out your...
Where am I?
Oh, yeah.
San Francisco...
Come to papa, sweetheart.
Oh, playing hard to get, huh?
I like it that way.
Okay... hmmm..
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Drop her, you little punk.
I'm gonna kick your ass.
Buckwheat, I is gonna
give you an advantage.
Take a last good Iook at
God's sweet earth, Mister.
'cause youz about to meet
the being what made it.
Mr. Yarman?
Quiet down, Mrs. Trend.
There but one way to
catch a rat in the dark,
you wait.
Rat, he just gotta show
you his pink little ass.
You can't seem
to catch this rat!
I'll get ya.
Rat ain't been made what can
get away from Mr. Yarman.
See?
It's a long road
that's got no end.
To catch a rat, you
gotta find him first.
Right.
And rats like me
are hard to find.
Bon voyage, sucker.
Oh, honey, look at that man!
Better not getting involved.
Hey, what's so funny? Why don't
you share it with the rest of us.
Aw, go on...
- Taxi!
- Where to?
Some night, huh?
Some night? It couldn't
have possibly been worse.
I almost get run over.
Lose a dance contest...
Heh..
Get stood up by a heel.
And spend most of the
evening washing dishes to...
pay for a good
time I didn't have.
It couldn't possibly
have been worse.
You met me, didn't ya?
Exactly.
I think things could
have been a lot worst.
Look at the bright side.
You and your bright side!
There is no bright side!
You're not being
rational, Nancy.
Of course there's
a bright side.
No bright side.
No bright side.
No... bright... side!
NO BRIGHT SIDE!
Nancy, I'm going to pretend
I didn't hear that...
Oh!
I can take care of myself.
Of course you can, Nancy...
but taking care of each other,
that's what's important.
Who are you?
You're ruining my day.
What'd I do?
What's all that noise?
Car 9, car 9. Report to
Watchtower Apartments.
Domestic squabble.
That is all.
Come on...
Who are you anyway?
Come on! Come on!
Come on already..
Come on..
God!
Use the elevator.
Come on, God...
Ow!
I'm Captain of this elevator...
and we are stopping
at every floor.
Whoa!
Nancy, once we get you back in
your apartment and all cleaned up
you'll feel like a million
bucks. Here we go!
Whoa!
- Arthur?
- Faron?
Look out!
Okay, Nancy, my
eyes are closed.
You can hand me
that dress now.
Can I open my eyes yet?
Not yet!
Behind you.
Open up, please.
It's the Police.
Where'd you get the Negro, Butch?
Elevator.
What kind of paranoid schizo
could kill a man in cold blood
and then jelly up his
face with shaving cream?
My dad!
Son!
I don't know what I ever saw...
in that heel in the first place...
Oh, he's not such a bad
guy, just a little confused.
Am I confused too, Vic?
No, Nancy. I think your
emotions are wonderful.
I wish I could be as
expressive as you.
You were so free
when you kissed me
in the restaurant and
when you slapped me.
I think you're wonderful.
I... have to get some
more Sudzo for that dress.
I'll be right back.
Vic?
Um hmm.
I've just been thinking
about what you said...
and it's very sweet but the truth is...
I haven't been completely honest
with my feelings about you.
Thank you for helping me tonight.
No problem.
Of all the men I've known,
none of them would have done
what you did for me tonight.
Gosh!
I just want you to know I
think you're a very wonderful
and a very special person.
It's not often I get a chance
to meet a girl like you.
Nancy?
Where are you?
Freshening...
freshening up.
It sounds like that congestion's
moving to your throat.
Listen, I just saw Mrs.
Ellroy in the hall...
and she said that there are a couple
of maniacs running around with forks
in their noses and she's concerned
because she hasn't seen Jack or
Jack junior for...for quite a while.
Gracious.
Yeah, it sounds like they're
a couple of real sickos.
Did you hear that?
There's a couple of maniacs
running loose out there.
Oh, God.
I know you can take
care of yourself...
but, ah... I just thought I
oughta pass it along.
Well, tonight certainly has
been rough on you.. but...I...
I just have to tell
you Nancy, for me...
it's been the most
wonderful night of my life.
It probably sounds funny to...
a girl like you
who's met lots of swell guys and...
I know that'll sounds funny...
to a girl like you who's met
Iots of swell guys
and had lots of wonderful evenings.
But... I never met a girl like you before...
but I've never met a
girl like you before...
What a turkey!
I know I don't deserve you,
but I just had to tell you how I felt
before I... walked out of
your life... forever.
Take a hike, pal.
You could tell me to
stay if you wanted to,
but if you don't....
I'll understand.
I understand.
I think he's gone.
Listen I just have to get a chance
to thank him before he goes.
I really love your decor.
You know, it's a terrific
place you got here.
Oh, golly gee, your hair
really smells terrific.
You know, I don't get a chance to
talk to people like that you know...
Pretty girls like you ya know.
When I was in school
my mom used to let me.
They never let me talk to anybody.
You know and I hated my mom.
That's why I'm killing the rodents.
Because, you know, every time
I kill one of those guys...
I see my mom in
their face, ya know.
I never had a chance.
'cause, you know, I'm a like
a product of the 60's...
Vietnam, napalm, libby stick,
LBJ, all the way...
Ya know... Kent State,
pay the price, Soul on Ice.
Mrs. Trend... you better
get back to your apartment
there are a couple of maniacs
loose in this building.
I told you never to call me that!
Arthur!
You have a rodent problem?
Hey, Arthur.
Every man for himself!
Whoa!
Faron!
Ready or not. Here I come.
Come back here.
Hey, baby. Why don't you
come on over to my pad..ah...
we'll have a scotch and sofa.
You heel.
So I'm a heel.
So what of it?
I'm not such a bad guy...
or am I?
Huh?
Pardon me.
Ernest Al !...
Watch it, fatso!
Get out of the way.
Avon Calling.
I've gotcha!
I got ya!
- Oh, my God!
- Yo, load em up.
Let's see, the 240 will get me the
515 and the 315 will get me...
Stop this nonsense immediately.
Put her down this instant
you filthy little man.
Who's gonna stop me you old bat.
You and those fag dogs?
That's right.
Hey, where ya going?
The night is young.
Hey, you little witch.
Brother Faron!
I'll get the truck!
Let me in here!
Okay, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Goin' my way, sweetheart?
Women drivers.
- Faron, are you okay?
- Get in the truck, idiot.
Look what they did to me...
Oh, I wanna...
Wah, I'm gonna get you..
Oh, I hate animals!
Nancy!
What's the trouble, son?
Some maniacs are after my girl...
and I wonder if you'd
let me take your...
You love her, son?
Yes, sir. I reckon I do.
She sticks a little in third.
I don't claim to know a whole
lot about the grand design.
Those fellows are gonna
suck on some abuse.
Arthur, go ahead, go on.
No, No.. I know ya...
Go ahead, take one.
No, no.
I know you don't mean it.
Arthur, I'm telling
you it's okay.
- Yeah?
- Go on.
You freak!
Ramming speed!
Go get her.
Get along little doggy....
and come home to me.
Beat it!
Get out of the way!
Asshole!
Victor, Help!
I'm coming, Nancy!
Make way for Victor Ajax!
Why you...
- You're under citizen's arrest, fella.
- Oh, yeah..
The eye!
That does it.
Taste justice!
I'm coming, Arthur...
Should I stop?
Not just yet!
Nancy, I feel like a wishbone!
I'm being split in two!
Do you want me to stop?
What?
Why those guys!...
I only borrowed that car!
- Hey, Vic?
- Huh?
Go on, go get him, Arthur.
He over there.
Tally-Ho.
Right, Mister!
Keep off of my boot.
Keep off of the Dodge.
- Stand by for the bat.
- Ow-oh
Arthur, are you
all right up there?
- Look out for that old Vet.
- There's no...
Suprise... suprise!
How do you want it, Vic,
medium or well done?
- Look out!
- Nancy!
You broke my shocker.
Mister, you've done
some bad things
and I'm gonna deal out
some swift justice...
this one's for bothering my girl...
this one's for giving me this...
this one's for ruining my date
and here's one for all
the folks everywhere.
Okay son, I give up...
Please don't hit me again
with that baseball bat.
I realize what I did was wrong
when... well... I'm.. I'm sorry.
Sometimes, sorry isn't good enough.
Wait, from now on I'll be good.
I swear it's the truth.
Just one more chance...
- Well...
- Please.... friend?
Pal?
All right...
but just this once.
Put 'er there buddy.
Knock his brains out.
Well, it look like the end
of the road for you, Vic.
Don't look now, but here
comes an overpass!
You really tear me up, Vic.
Can I call you Vic?
I mean that's the difference
between me and you.
That's why you're down
there and I'm up here.
You see Vic...
You believe in people and I don't.
That's why I'm gonna bash
your stinkin' little skull...
Arthur?...   Arthur!
Why you little...
Yowwwww!
Victor!
Nancy!
Victor... save me!
Nancy!
I got ya, Nancy!
Oh, not so fast.
You can still put
a stop to this.
I certainly intend to.
Ah, this is a nightmare.
And away we go!
She's going over...
please... please..
I'm coming, Nancy!
Hold on kid,
we're almost there.
You wanna play rough, aye.
Let's go.
Eat guard rail, fatso.
Fatso!... I'll....
Here I come.
Now it's your turn, toots
Nancy... Nancy, jump!
Nancy, jump!
I can't make it!
You can make it.
It's too far!
Come to me, Nancy.
Nancy!
Hold on! Hold on!
Oh, are you all right?
Oh... No, Nancy.  Please,
oh, oh, ok, oh, oh.
Not the ear..
Hold on, Nancy...
Oh, goodness. Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?
Oh, no! Not the eye!
Who were those guys anyway?
Oh, Gee.. I don't know.
- I mean, where'd they come from?
- I can't believe you...
- Well, how'd they get you?
- Are you okay?
Nancy, I came into your room
and I thought you didn't care...
about me.
Oh! Vic, I do care...
you saved...
And then I hit the water
so you see I'm practically a hero,...
Oh, thanks.
So if it hadn't been for me
there's no telling how many people
those maniacs might've killed.
Tell it to Saint Peter!
Saint Peter? Oh yeah
that's a good one!
But seriously, if you can
just find Nancy she'd
prove everything I've told you.
Nancy, Nancy, you probably killed
her just like all the others.
She's alive, I tell ya.
She was on the bridge.
I don't know what
happened to her,
but maybe if you ran a
picture of her in the paper.
Ah! sure! Yeah, we'll
run a picture of her.
- Yeah! Yeah.
- Next to your obit.
Yeah! Next to my...
Hallelujah...
Hal-le-lu-jah...
Well, I've still got five minutes.
Hold it! Hold it!
It's the Governor.
Am I too late?
No, Governor.
Thank God...
I didn't want to miss this.
Sayonara!
Wait!
That man is innocent!
Nancy!
Aw, come on!
Victor, darling, I had no idea.
When you fell off that bridge,
I thought you were dead.
I wandered for days.
What were you
wondering about?
And then these good
sisters took me in.
Hi! I'm Vic.
I was about to take my
vow of eternal silence
when I read about this horrible
mistake in the newspapers.
I think she's lying.
Can you good sisters corroborate
this young lady's story?
They can't speak!
They've taken the vow
of eternal silence!
Too bad!
Right!
She likes me!
Trivia...
IMDB states: "Paul L. Smith's voice
was dubbed in by another
actor during post-production."
But doesn't say who.
The movie was shot in Detroit
and George Baier was part
of JJ and the Morning Crew..
on Detroit's WRIF radio in the 80's.
George did the voices of Dick the Bruiser,
Popeye and several other characters.
The extra at the elevator
does the Popeye voice.
Faron is close to his Dick the Bruiser voice.
George Baier must have done the dub.
Hope you enjoyed the new transcription.
Hey..... Hey!
Is anybody out there?
