Happy anniversary.
- Wish you the same.
Why didn't you bring out this
cake for our anniversary last night?
You know why. ‘Kyunki
Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi'..
...'Kuchh ls Tara',
'Kasamh Se' (Hindi serials)..
And you can't afford
to miss that, right?
It's you who missed something.
- What?
Where's my anniversary gift?
You.. That must have hurt a lot.
A little. But your love
was like a pain killer.
But it would've hurt a lot more..
..had your name been
Pushpanjali Lakshmi.
Where's my gift?
Here you go. A scuba-diving suit!
I thought, since you're into the
fish import and export business..
..you should get a chance to
explore the underwater world.
Get into it right away,
and let's go scuba-diving!
No, you know I'm scared of water.
Besides, the water
is freezing today!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Gopal, someone's drowning!
GOpaI?
There you go. - Are you okay?
- I'm okay. I'm fine.
You're welcome. - Oh, thank
you so much. Thank you so much.
So, how was the water?
Freezing or hot?
Someone pushed me into the water!
Hey, who was it..
You've given me a fine jolt.
What is this?
ls this why it didn't hurt?
It did hurt at the start!
It hurt a lot! I did try!
But then, I stuck a sticker
because I wanted to make you happy.
And then you stuck to that
girl like a sticker yourself!
You'll never change!
Ekta!
What a disaster!
Shut up! I've had enough!
I've reached my boundary!
Not boundary, Sir.
You've reached your limit.
Shut up, Sawant! The
boss is always right.
Look over there! What is that?
Just like every
bucket makes an ocean..
Sir, every drop makes an ocean!
Shut up, Gopal! The boss
is always right. - Yes, Sir.
Similarly, every fish
has been responsible..
..in making my.. I mean, Bablu
Pachisiya's Golden Fisheries.
And what did I find out today?
That we're going through a loss!
And all due to
carelessness on your part!
I'll soon be reduced to a pauper,
all thanks to you!
I'll be.. out of place nowhere..
..and at home everywhere!
No, Sir. You're saying it wrong.
You'll be out of place everywhere,
and at home nowhere, Sir!
Shut up! - Yes, Sir. -
The boss is always right.
The boss is always right.
You know, I found out..
..that some of our old staff is
stealing the fish and lobsters.
In fact, Peter and
Pali have even started..
..a stall in their neighborhood..
...called Prawns' Corner!
That's why I've decided".
No, Sir. Please,
don't sell the company.
Sir, if the company is sold off,
I'll SMS (Short Message Service)..
Shut up!
- Subodh..
Mr. Subodh Mehra, you type
out messages all the time!
I'm sure your entire salary is
spent on sending those messages.
Absolutely.
- So, what was I saying?
Yes! I'm going to fire the
old staff and hire new people!
Strictly vegetarians! No
fish-eaters, no fiascos!
Correct.
- Correct. - Correct, Sir.
But if we hire
inexperienced people..
No more discussions!
Gopal and you, start
training fresh new talent.
I don't want any old people.
If the staff is fit, the
company will be a hit!
And that applies
to the three of you!
Good.. good night, Sir!
Did you hear him, Gopal?
The boss is always right.
I want the recruitment list for
the new staff by this evening.
Make it quick. And
stay away from him.
Hey! - You heard him?
The boss is always right.
I want the list by this evening.
Lousy SMS!
- Hello!
I'll prepare the list
while you party with the loot?
What loot?
- Oh, come on!
The one you were playing
a 'Baywatch' guy with!
lﬂgnlmlegriczu!
Who's in charge on the dock?
- I am.
Tell me. - I'm inspector
Madhav Singh Ghai. And you are..
Everybody knows who I am.
I'm Gopal Kumar Santoshi.
Nice meeting you.
According to our informers,
along with exporting fish..
..you're also into
exporting cocaine and heroin.
It's profitable, but it's illegal.
I think it's your
informers who are into those drugs.
Oh. - Nothing of that sort
goes on here. Please leave.
I will, after conducting a
thorough search of your ship.
Do you have a search warrant?
Yes, show it to him.
Sir..
- Remove it.
Sir? - What? - I
forgot to bring the warrant.
Sorry, Sir. I forgot.
- Idiot!
What did you think this was? A
park where you could take a stroll?
L..
- Come on, scoot!
Look, I'm a police officer..
I'll come back! Hey, who
are you trying to kiss?
I'll be back with the warrant.
- Out! - You be ready!
Understand?
- Security!
Let's get out! Get inside,
everybody!
He's a mad man!
- Let it go, Sir.
A maniac!
- Let's get out of here, Sir.
He's crazy!
Your hairstyle..
I missed you, Lucky!
You know, there's a party
tonight at Mrs. Bhujwala's place.
Celebrities are
going to grace the event.
And like always, I want to
look different, you know!
Come on, sweetheart!
Lucky, do you know something?
I was given a direct entry
into the Miss India contest.
Unfortunately, I got
married before that.
My husband said that I
didn't need to enter the contest..
..because I'm different.
Lucky, your sweetheart has
just stepped out of the gym!
Wow, Lucky! You look at everyone,
but she's giving you the look!
Why don't you go talk to her?
Yes, go talk to her.
He's right.
When she comes to know that
your mouthpiece is damaged..
..you won't stand a chance!
Hey, Lucky! Sparks are
flying between the two of you.
But why is the smoke
coming out of there?
There!
Oh, my God! What is this?
Great! This is the latest
hairstyle. Lucky's 'burnt look'.
Burnt look?
- Yes! Burnt look!
Seeing this, people will
singe with envy at the party!
Oh, no!
- Oh, yes! You look fabulous.
You really do!
- Mind-blowing!
Out of this world!
- Beautiful! Awesome!
I'm so pretty that I can
carry off any hairstyle.
Do you know why?
- Because you're different!
Yes!
Do you have any sense? - What
have you done? - What have you done?
Where had you gone off to?
- You've ruined her hair!
"Promise."
'Don't worry, I'm
there for you. Am I not?
'Relax, don't hang up.'
'Relax, I'm there.'
Lucky, you're blocking my view.
What? Your
brother-in-law needs a haircut?
Yes.
- But he got one just last week.
Like this? Keep
your arm up. Look up.
Gopal! What's this nonsense?
It's called 'power yoga', baby.
Don't you know of it? It
gets written about a lot.
Actually, my company's MD sacked all
the unfit people from theirjobs.
I have to stay fit,
or I'll lose my job.
But why hire a female trainer?
Get out! Don't show
me your face again.
Ekta, what are you..
Mr. Gopal, you need brains,
not brawn, to do your work.
Lucky, no haircut for him, and
don't you dare utter a single word!
The truth is, you want
to be physically fit..
..because you want to
increase the rating of..
..your physical relationships!
Lucky, come with me.
Sister-in-law, what's wrong?
Ask your brother.
Brother, what's got into her?
Soaps, extra-marital affairs,
ratings..
They were right to have
named his sister 'Ekta'.
Hey!
- Shut up, and cut my hair!
I'll be back in sometime.
- Where are you off to?
I'm going for coffee with a friend.
Esha, one can buy an
entire coffee house..
..with the amount you've spent on
drinking coffee with your friend.
Call him home tomorrow.
Okay, Brother. I'll
call him tomorrow.
Thank you! Bye.
That's not possible, Jigna.
Our job is to export fish,
crabs and lobsters.
How will you work for us if you're
not even willing to touch them?
I'm a little touchy
about these matters, Sir.'
I'm a pure vegetarian.
You'll have to do it,
if you want the job.
Ma'am, what are you doing here?
I've brought food for Gopal
from his favorite restaurant.
I want to give him a surprise.
Okay, I'll help you.
Touchit
- Please, Sir! I can't do this.
Come on, Jigna. Do
as your boss says.
You'll make me happy by touching it.
Do one thing. Close your eyes,
and then touch it. - Sir!
You'll be rid of your fear.
- Okay. - Okay?
Come on! How do you feel?
I feel rather ticklish.
I told you! You were
needlessly scared.
But, Sir, if my fiance finds
out that I'm doing this at work..
...he'll break off the engagement.
Jigna, I too am a married man.
I would never want to
break up anyone's relationship.
Let's try again tomorrow.
You'll be absolutely confident then.
Okay, Sir.
So, you were training
her to catch, Gopal!
Ekta! Yes, the poor girl
needs the job.. - Shut up!
You're following in the footsteps..
..of ‘Mihir Virani and Walia‘ (Lead
protagonists of two Hindi serials).
Who are they?
- Don't change the topic, Gopal!
How many other affairs
are you having? Tell me!
ls this what you do at
work all day? - Ekta..
Have an affair with
whosoever you can get your hands on?
Why don't you listen..
- You don't have an answer, do you?
But l..
- Shame on you, Gopal!
Shut up! Now I'll talk,
and you'll listen.
Sir! I'm feeling
much more confident now.
I'll do a better job from tomorrow.
Ekta!
It looks like his surprise
was way bigger than yours!
Your anger is perfectly justified,
but Mr. Gopal isn't that bad.
He only starts
salivating at the sight of a girl!
He's a saint, that man!
The way he lusts for women..
..anyone would believe
it was his first time!
You're very fortunate.
He's a gem of a guy.
But these fools
don't understand him.
They call him Gopal, the flirt!
Look, this is Kannupriya's
message for Gopal, the flirt..
Sister-in-law!
This is wrong, Sir.
You're married, while I'm engaged.
The only relationship we can share..
..is that of a boss
and his secretary.
Some things are not
under one's control.
It's true that I'm a married man..
Jigna, you're the
reason why I'm living.
But, Sir, I'm just a secretary..
You're not just a secretary.
You're my personal secretary.
"Fishy."
This is Gopal's car.
- Yes, it's his.
This is Gopal's car.
Gopal's car!
And do you know the difference..
..between a secretary
and a personal secretary?
No, Sir. - A secretary says,
'Good morning, Sir.'
And a personal secretary says,
'It's morning, Sir! '
But, Sir, my fiance..
- Forget him!
Okay. But what about your wife?
My Wife?
She must be glued to the
television, watching a silly serial.
Forget about her too!
What?
The car got a flat tire. I had
to use the stepney (spare tire).
Stepney? ls this the first
time you're telling the truth?
What do you mean?
- Stephnie's figure is 36-24..
Why is the backseat
strewn with rose petals?
Oh, God! I'd gone with
flowers for a colleague's funeral.
You're disgusting! You now
make excuses of people dying..
..to cover up your love affairs!
I'm only 15 minutes late!
What can I
possibly do in 15 minutes?
Tell her something! - Lucky,
don't you dare say a single word!
Shame on you, Gopal.
The whole world is condemning you!
Even the neighbors know
the number of your car.
They spotted you at
Lover's Point with that witch.
You both couldn't get your
hands off each other! - Witch?
People call you a flirt.
Flirt? Who called me a flirt?
Subodh did.
- Subodh! I'll get him.
I'll kill him.. I'll kill
him in such a way that..
What's happening?
- It's an everyday story. Come.
I'll shove him into
the deep-freezer..
..to rot with a decade old
dried Bombay Duck fish for..
..the next 20 years!
I'll seal him in an air-tight box..
..and release thousands of
poisonous crabs over him.
I won't spare him
so easily. I will..
What did you say?
Yes, you do that to him.
YOU?
- YOU? _ You?
Yuck!
- Wow! You both know each other.
I know this mad-man very well.
Come on, get out!
Why didn't you tell me
before that you're mad?
No.. - Esha, I don't mind if you
bring home a homeless or lame fellow.
But I don't want another
suspicious mad person in the family!
Who exactly are you hinting at?
Let me deal with him first.
- What?
Get out, you mad-man!
You're the one who was
describing ways to commit murder!
Am I a mad-man or you?
Let go of me!
- Brother!
Why did you vent your anger on Mads?
Flirt!
Do you have anything to say?
The entire family
seems mentally disturbed.
Everything will be fine.
out!
"Fishy."
Hello, Sir.
- Subodh Mehra!
Help! Have you gone mad?
You like to break
people's homes, don't you?
What did you tell my wife?
That I'm a flirt? You're a flirt!
Your father is a flirt, and so
is your grandfather! - Help!
Let go of me!
What's the matter with you?
What's going on? Stop it, Gopal!
Sir, he likes to break
people's homes. I won't spare him!
He's a lousy fellow.
Let me talk to him.
- Don't! Just call the cops.
Alright. One moment, Subodh.
Fine, call the cops! Go ahead.
- He spoke of breaking my fingers.
I'll chop your fingers
in front of the police..
..and feed them to the fish.
Enough is enough! One moment,
Gopal. I'm talking to him. Stop it!
You're always out to get him!
You don't want to kill him, do you?
Come on, back to work everybody.
Why are you still standing around?
He's nothing but a wife's pet!
He's scared of his wife.
- Let go!
He's terrified of his wife,
and shows off his courage here.
He's coming this way, Sir.
You've come again?
They say that if you wish to
bash up someone with a true heart..
..the whole universe conspires
to help you fulfill your wish.
Give me the search warrant, quick!
Search warrant!
Hey, did you tear a
page off my joke book?
No, Sir. You were right
about him. He's out of his mind.
You stuffed-face..
- That's a good one!
Tell sir that this is the
warrant for the ship Sea Queen..
..which is in Sri
Lanka at the moment.
Read what's written there.
This is the Blue Ribbon.
You typed it wrong, you moron!
You're the Lord's ignominy.
I want the file on the crab,
not the fish. - Hello?
Put Gopal on the line.
- Yes, Ma'am.
Excuse me, Sir. A call for you.
- Put it on speaker mode.
Hello! - What's the program for
today? Back seat or front seat?
Ekta, don't start off again.
It's you who started off, Gopal!
You forgot you were
supposed to be home..
..10 minutes back, at sharp 7:30pm.
Baby, calm down..
- 'He's nothing but a wife's pet! '
'He's scared of his wife.'
'He's terrified of his wife,
and shows off his courage here.'
Ekta, don't treat me
like a daily soap..
..by expecting me to show
up everyday at sharp 7:30pm.
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!
Let go of me! Help!
Don't touch me! Don't!
Let go of me! Let go!
Hello! What's going on?
Help me.
Oh, sorry! I shouldn't have come!
- No! No, save me!
Are you hurt?
Oh, no!
What did you do to my car?
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Thank you so much for saving
my life. - You're welcome.
My car has broken down.
- So has mine.
What shall we do now?
We won't get any conveyance here.
I have a suggestion. A friend of
mine owns a yacht in this area.
We could go there and
make some arrangements.
No!
- Esha!
Let go, Maddy.
- Esha, wake up!
Aren't you bored of having coffee?
- Esha!
Esha!
- Sister-in-law!
What's wrong?
- Gopal hasn't reached home yet.
It's 1am, and his
mobile is switched off.
Why didn't you wake me up earlier?
It looks like it's going to pour.
We could halt at the
yacht for sometime. Come.
Please come.
- Thank you.
Will you have something?
No.
What does that mean?
Nothing. Thank you.
TV?
'Oh, I can't do this. I can't.'
'What's wrong? It's okay.
- No, I can't do this.'
Oh, no!
- What happened?
I'm scared of the dark.
Don't be. I'm with you.
What are you trying to say?
What? Someone shot Gopal?
Brother!
- No!
Esha, that witch at his office
had warned him about her family.
I'm sure her fiance has shot him.
'You were playing
catch with my Jigna! '
'I won't spare you! '
'I won't spare you! '
'N0, don't kill him!'
‘Ekta! '
God, why did You have
to call him so soon?
I love reality, but only
when it's shown on TV!
Lucky, you're also finding it
difficult to accept the fact..
..that your
brother-in-law is no more, right?
You'll have to accept it.
Lucky, what are you
looking for? A photo of Gopal?
To hang it on the wall?
I have a solo photograph of him.
Lucky, control yourself!
He's become speechless
because of the trauma!
Hands UP!
Maddy!
- Hi! Hold the gun.
Baby! I missed you..
Esha! Where's the dead body?
Whose dead body? I
don't know of a dead body!
Gopal's dead body!
Gopal is dead?
I'm really sorry to hear that.
Where's his dead body?
It's you who brought
the news of his death.
You should know
where his dead body is.
Dead body? News? Are you
mistaking me for a TV channel?
How would I know?
Lucky told me!
He told you? He fled in
terror as soon as he saw me!
Lucky.. you murdered
your brother-in-law! - No!
Hey! Be.. be careful!
One minute. He's trying to
say that Gopal is alive!
The wretch isn't dead.
But why are you on duty at 3am?
Why am I on duty at 3am?
Your entire family
is mentally disturbed!
You were the one who called me home!
Oh, yes! Ekta had
become so emotional.
But why hasn't
brother returned home yet?
Hello, Sir?
- Yes, tell me.
A dead body has been found
on Blue Cross street, Sir.
A dead body has been found?
ls it Gopal's?
No, Sir. You aren't that lucky.
The dead body is someone else's.
But come soon, Sir.
Esha, it's an emergency.
I have to go. - Bye.
Wait, Inspector.
- Yes? - What news have you got?
A dead body was found
on Blue Cross street.
No!
- Brother!
Shut up! It's
someone else's dead body.
Oh.
- Oh.
Crazy family!
Sir, it seems to be a
murder committed by a mad man.
His fingers have been broken.
The killer must have
a fetish for fingers.
That reminds me. Take
his fingerprints. - Yes.
Send the body for a post-mortem.
We need all the evidence possible.
Let's find the
killer and bash him up!
This guy won't need a
nail-cutter anymore!
You're still in shock?
Gopal won't ever come back.
I'm no Tulsi or Parvati
(characters of two Hindi serials)..
..whose husbands
return from the dead.
Lucky!
Look, brother's back!
Brother!
Are you alright?
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.
What's going on?
I was away for one night,
and you people..
One whole night away! God, why me?
In which resort did you
spend the eventful night?
In whose lap did
you do the lap-dance?
Sweetheart, something
unexpected happened last night.
Sure, spin a yarn! That you
were walking down a street..
..when suddenly out of nowhere..
..you saw some goons
harass a poor woman. - Yes.
You jumped to her rescue..
..and she adopted
you as her brother.
No, nothing of that sort happened.
Then what happened?
Last night, I was
walking down the street..
..when suddenly out of nowhere,
I saw a woman..
Ask for forgiveness, my son.
Remember that behind every
successful man, there's a woman.
But behind every unsuccessful man..
..there are two, three, many more.
Brother, who's this other woman?
Nobody!
Last night, l..
I was tired of your questions!
That's why I switched off my mobile.
Later that night, I ran
into an old school friend..
..who took me home. We were so
engrossed talking all night..
Name?
- Gopal.
Your friend's name!
Akbar.. Anthony Gonsalves.
I've never heard of this
friend of yours before.
Me too. I mean, I hadn't
heard from him in many years.
Where does he stay?
Please drop it, sweetheart.
- Address!
Tell me!
Macchi Talao, Dockyard Lane..
opposite Prawns Corner..
..Door No. 420.
Now, excuse me, please.
"Don't doubt someone."
Forgive her, God. She believes him.
Bye.
Hi. I'm Daisy.
Hi. I'm Lucky.
And I'm lucky to meet you.
You have a very manly voice.
Thanks. The selectors of 'Voice of
India' (A reality show) said so too.
Actually, there's
something I want to tell you..
First, hear me out. I want to
say those three magic words..
l.. love..
What's the matter? Why
are you screaming? - What?
Hi. I'm Daisy.
I have a friend named Sambo.
She needs a new
haircut and a new look.
Could you give me an
appointment for tomorrow, please?
Why aren't you saying anything?
- He can't! He's mute.
It's just temporary. A
toothache problem. - Oh, I see!
He has a bad swelling too.
Where was it again? The other side!
I'm so sorry, Lucky. But
it was nice to meet you.
Thank you so much. See
you tomorrow. Bye. - Bye.
'Fishy! Fishy! '
'Fishy! Fishy! '
Lucky, I'd gone to
the courier office.
I've mailed Anthony
Gonsalves on the address..
..Gopal had specified.
Lucky, if Anthony Gonsalves
truly exists, then there's..
..no need for any tension.
But if he doesn't..
..your brother-in-law
will be in deep trouble.
Here.
Gopal, where's the file
of the new recruitments?
Hasn't Subodh Mehra
given it to you, Sir?
Gopal..
- One minute.
Kishore, where's Subodh Mehra?
Sir, he hasn't come to
work for the past two days.
He must have gotten
thrashed by someone.
I'll have it sent right away, Sir.
- Alright. I'll be waiting.
What did you see?
Ekta?
- Yes!
What happened to her?
She wrote a letter
to someone? To whom?
Anthony Gonsalves?
I don't have any friend
named Anthony Gonsalves.
Lucky, you're getting me wrong.
Actually, I was with
a girl that night.
You're getting me wrong again!
First, listen to me!
Listen.. Just hear me out!
That night, I'd saved a woman
from the clutches of some goons.
Our cars had broken down, so we
had to spend the night at the yacht.
Now, if I say this to your sister,
will she believe me?
She won't, right?
She won't ask for a divorce.
She'll commit suicide!
Do you want your
sister to commit suicide?
Do you want your
parents to die of shock?
Do you wish to be orphaned, Lucky?
If yes, then call Ekta
and tell her everything.
Forget it, I'll tell her myself.
We'll sort out this mess.
Who will save us now?
"Whether there's something
fishy or the fish is in something."
"I'm amazing, baby. I'm a wonder!"
"Be careful, let no
one steal your heart!"
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
May I come in, Sir?
- Come in.
I've come to apply for the
post of the Junior Manager.
I'm Lakshman Prasad, boss.
Lakshman Prasad?
- Boss.
Do you know him?
No. Who's he?
He too was Lakshman Prasad.
Was?
Now, he's in seventh heaven.
Anyway, sit. Qualifications?
Thank you, boss. Today,
every Tom, Dick and Harry..
..can boast of
experience and qualifications.
But ask me what
other quality I have..
..that makes me a
deserving candidate for the job.
And what's that?
I can sort out any situation. I
have the solution to every problem.
Just name it, and I'm there.
Whether it's a problem of
missing fish on the dock..
...or just a faulty cable
TV dish or toilet flush..
..that needs repair at home..
...I'm there for you! Whether
it's a clash with another firm..
..or a Symonds-Bhajji-Steve
Bucknor problem..
..or the problem of an
extramarital affair..
...I'm there for you!
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
What was the last thing you said?
The problem of an
extramarital affair.
I'm there for you.
No, I think you're
all talk, no show.
Sir, all I ask is a
chance to prove myself.
Give me a problem, and I'll
immediately solve it for you.
Okay. I have a friend..
- A friend.
He lied to his wife
that he spent the night..
..at his friend
Anthony Gonsalves's house.
But the truth is that he
had saved a girl's life..
..and later, they spent
some time together on a yacht.
Since the girl was a bit
uncomfortable at the start..
..he switched on the
TV to distract her.
But a hot intimate scene
flashed on the TV screen!
The girl got more uncomfortable..
...while you got even more so.
Me?
' Y°s= you.
That night, your friend
wasn't with that girl.
You were, boss? Am I right?
Do you have a parrot?
What do you mean?
I mean, the parrot that
predicts people's futures.
No, Sir. I don't need a parrot to
predict what must have happened.
After watching
those intimate scenes..
..you took a good look
at the girl's figure..
..and then, you forgot
that you're a married man.
The chemistry between
you both sent a spark..
..and you drew
physically closer together.
And then, a sensuous,
seductive, titillating romantic..
..duet filled the air.
That's enough! This was
just an appetizer, boss.
You've already had the main course.
After all, horny men.. I mean,
who can stop the inevitable?
Right?
Boss, you're blushing.
Never mind. I'll take care
of the problem with your wife.
She has never seen Anthony.
She hasn't seen me either.
Problem solved!
- How's that?
From today, I'm Anthony Gonsalves.
I'll tell your wife that you
spent the night at my place..
..not with that girl.
Okay?
Tell me something.
- Yes?
You look like a rogue..
- Thank you.
But you're a worse
rogue than you look!
Thank you, boss. Now, all
you've got to do is hire me.
Then my girlfriend's
family will be happy..
..and they'll let us get married.
You don't have a parrot, do you?
- No. I don't.
But I do. First, get me off the
hook. Only then will I hire you.
Tomorrow at 9am.
Okay, boss.
Hey! Ramu!
Ramu..
Are you mute?
- Yes.
Tell your mistress..
Look, Ramu..
Tell the lady that
Anthony Gonsalves is here.
Yes, that's what.
No, not Bhansali, Gonsalves!
I've mailed Anthony
Gonsalves on the address..
..Gopal had specified.
'I don't have any friend
named Anthony Gonsalves.'
'Do you want your
sister to commit suicide? '
'Do you want your
parents to die of shock? '
'Do you wish to be orphaned,
Lucky?'
Gonsalves.
- Out!
I want to go in.
- Out! Out!
Why are you pushing me? I
told you, I have to go inside!
Hey, don't push me! Enough!
Enough!
I've seen the National Body
Building Championship thrice!
Look at my bulging arms, my biceps,
my broad chest, my triceps..
Why are you laughing?
Take a good look.
Why are you laughing?
Why are you humiliating me?
Don't be deceived. It's
just that I'm fasting today.
Listen up..
Quiet!
No stones, please!
Stones are not allowed.
That's cheating!
Don't behave like a kid!
I'm going. Put it down.
Why are you singing?
Anthony Gonsalves
still hasn't shown up.
You drove Anthony Gonsalves out?
You fool, that was my idea!
He was an imposter!
You're an expert
at ruining my plans.
Go get him!
It's hot!
"Do you wanna partner.. 0 partner..
Love me, love me say."
Hey! Get lost.
- Come with me. - Go!
My prospective father-in-law tells
me to stand on my own two feet.
But my state is such
that I'll never be able to..
..sit down as long as I live!
Hey, give me one.
- You give me one first.
You haven't gone yet? I'll give
you one hard.. - Give it to me!
Get lost!
- Fine, I'm going.
But do make up your mind!
He just won't leave me alone!
I'm going! - I wonder what he's
going to stab me with this time!
I'm going! - Stop there. Stop
right there, or I'll squash you!
You shut up! Sorry, not you.
Move to the left.
A bit to the right!
Let go of me.
- Bend down. Go back a bit.
Lucky! - To be..
Get aside, unlucky fellow!
Until..
I should talk? Hello..
Boss! Yes, boss. Oh, he's your man?
- I don't have a boss, okay?
Shut up! No, not you, boss.
Okay, boss. We'll
be there right away.
No! No, he's mine!
- One minute.
Here, hold this. Have a cold
drink and chill! Let's go.
Good morning, Goa! I'm
Anthony Gonsalves, and you are..
Ekta.
- Ekta!
"Call me once, and
I'll come running to you!"
Please, come in.
It's a nice house.
So tell me, why did you send
me a courier to call me home?
I just wanted to confirm..
..that my husband Gopal
was with you on Friday night.
Why ask me? Ask your husband.
What did he say?
He said he was with you.
You're unbelievable!
Why would you believe a
stranger over your husband?
Are you sure you want to
discuss personal matters..
..in front of your servant?
He's Lucky.
- For whom?
He's my brother.
- I see.
Mr. Anthony, Gopal and you..
Actually.. - Actually, Mrs. Ekta,
you have a disorder..
..of being overly suspicious.
If someone praises the
interior of your house..
..you call it your hard work.
But if someone praises your
husband, you get suspicious.
If you come home late,
you call it bad luck.
But if your husband comes
late you get suspicious.
If he loves you,
it's just your right.
But if he says even 'hi' or
'hello' to another woman..
..you get suspicious!
Suspicion! What the..
Ekta, many families
have been destroyed..
..thanks to
suspicious wives like you.
Just like the virus of suspicion
has destroyed your sensibilities.
That's why I say..
suspicion, what the..
Anthony, you!
- Gopal, my friend!
'Whether it's a
Monday or a Tuesday.. '
'Wednesday or a Thursday.. '
'Friday or a Saturday.. '
- 'We're friends, come what may! '
What was that?
We always greet each other
like this, ever since childhood.
What brings you here?
Don't ask.
Tell me.
No, forget it. I'm
embarrassed to talk about it.
Why? Did you do something stupid?
Forget it, Gopal.
It's all sorted out now.
Come on, tell me!
Your wife wanted to meet me.
- My wife?
But now, her suspicion has
been finally put to rest!
Suspicion?
She wanted to verify..
..whether or not you
were with me that night.
Gopal, please don't get
angry now. Just let it be.
Actually, Gopal, I was..
- Shut up!
Now, I'll talk and you'll listen.
Three years ago, I met you..
..and fell in love.
I was absolutely smitten..
..because I had lost my
heart to you, sweetheart.
But you got convinced my
loyalty was infidelity.
You thought I was a flirt
and that I was playing around.
Your suspicious nature
assumed new heights..
..and our dream of a
happily-ever-after shattered.
Ekta, you've hurt me terribly!
'Your love sunk like..
- Shut up!
Don't rub salt over the wound.
At least, I have a true friend,
if not a true love.
- Anthony!
I'm sorry, Gopal. I doubted you..
Leave me alone!
Sister-in-law, listen..
- Sorry.
Sister-in-law,
listen! Sister-in-law!
Suspicion.
- What the..
I feel sorry for the courier guy.
He must have gone crazy
trying to locate the address.
Machhi Talao!
Dockyard Lane!
Opposite Prawns Corner!
Excuse me.
- Yes?
Where does Anthony Gonsalves stay?
There are many
Anthonys in this lane.
One is a priest, the
other is a tea-seller..
And another is a flirt.
Which one are you looking for?
He's Ekta's.. - Oh, I see! It's
something to do with a girl? - Yes.
Then, it must be the flirt Anthony.
He lives in the
second room over there.
Who is it? Courier? Poor fellow.
Anthony Gonsalves?
- Yes, I'm Anthony Gonsalves.
There's a courier for you.
A courier for this fool?
'I'm Ekta, your
friend Gopal's wife.'
Gopal? Ekta?
'Gopal praises you a lot.'
'I need to meet you
urgently in secret.' Why?
'So, could you please come
over if you don't mind? '
'But please, come
between 9am to 6pm..
. As my husband is
away at work then.'
Bravo, Anthony!
Nowadays, husbands have started..
..to praise you to their wives!
I wouldn't bet on it.
- Get lost!
Ekta, I'm coming, sweetheart!
I wonder what you look like!
But I'm sure you look much
better than this antique furniture!
Whose letter is it?
- A friend's.
Which friend?
- Ekta.
A girl? Who is she?
No, a boy!
A friend who is no more.
I just got the news.
I'll have to go.
I'll have to carefully
lay him in his coffin..
..and strew flower
petals all over him.
I'll have to go!
Did he lose an old friend or
got a new one? - I'll have to go!
Oh, my God!
So this is what the matter is.
You lousy wretch!
You had better watch out for me.
Ramu!
ls Ekta around?
Tell her Anthony Gonsalves's wife,
Julie, is here to see her.
out!
'First, you drove Anthony away.
And now, his wife! '
'She was a part of
the plan, you fool! '
'She was the fake wife
of the fake Anthony! '
Girl? Where's she?
Hats off to you, boss.
What a colorful life you lead!
First on the yacht, and now at home.
She's a great catch!
True, but I don't know her.
- Did you call her?
ls she your wife?
My wife? What nonsense!
My grandpa was the last to
tie the knot in my family.
Fine.
Yes?
I'm Julie, Anthony Gonsalves's wife.
<i>Boss.</i>
She's your wife, Anthony.
Boss, she's Anthony's wife.
I'm Lakshman, remember?
So, you're the one who's
having an affair with my husband.
He's a moron. But
whatever happened to you?
How come you fell for
such a worthless fellow?
You're getting it all wrong.
I'd called him home
for a personal matter.
Was it so personal that
you asked him to come..
...only when your husband was away?
Stop it! I'll go call your husband.
That should clear
all the confusion.
Right now, he's in my
bedroom with my husband. - What?
He's in your bedroom
with your husband?
Disgusting!
I didn't know he's started
doing this too behind my back.
Anthony, you wretch! Come out!
I'll divorce you!
Anthony! Your wife
is here to see you.
Please, ask her to leave.
She has misunderstood! Come on.
She's talking of getting a divorce.
Please, tell her that
there's nothing cooking..
..between Gopal and you.
- Boss, help!
Ekta!
You had to see ‘Kahaani Ghar
Ghar Kii‘ (a show on TV), right?
It's time for that.
What nonsense! His wife is
about to divorce him, and you..
Get aside!
- Ekta, please don't bother.
She's just as suspicious as you
are, no matter what she hears.
That's why the poor
fellow always says..
Suspicion, what the..
Where are you hiding,
you stinking pig?
In two days, I'll drag you
to court and divorce you!
Don't. I'll divorce you! I do, I do!
You fool..
- You're divorcing her!
What are you saying?
Sorry. I divorce you, divorce you!
You pig! You wretch!
- That darn..
Excuse me. Two minutes. I'll..
Wait, I'll come and get you.
You're getting it all wrong.
Divorce! Divorce!
Julie, listen!
You fool! Were you
trying to save me or kill me?
What happened, boss?
- Anthony's wife was here.
So?
That means Anthony
too will come here.
Hey, you! Go and tell Mrs.
Ekta that her sweetheart is here.
Anthony Gonsalves!
Come on, Ramu.
What was that for?
It's him..
You're scared of him?
He wasn't around then, was he?
You handle him.
- Of course.
Hey, Cobra-man! You're really scary!
Get out, you fool!
I can't believe you're
scared of this joker!
Oh, no! Anthony's so angry!
Hey, you want some milk?
What are you doing?
Hey! Calm down, buddy.
You're here to see Ekta, aren't you?
Your life is set,
buddy. She's so hot!
Big brown eyes.
A slender waist.
And a stunning figure! She's so hot.
She's like a heater on
a cold winter's day.
Even Kareena Kapoor (Indian
actress) pales in comparison to her.
Ekta, I'm definitely coming.
But, Sir, how do you
know that she's so stunning?
That's because she's
my wife.. you fool!
What are you doing?
Tell me, will you ever
come around my house again?
If you wish, I won't
even go near my own house!
Good.
Will you ever hit on
someone else's wife?
Sir, if you want, I
won't hit on my own wife.
Good.
Why are you laughing, you fool?
GOpaI!
Hey, the mute guy spoke, Sir!
Will you ever again tell
anyone that your name is Anthony?
Anthony? Who's he? Where's he from?
I'm Atmaram, Sir.
Atmaram.
Atmaram.. - May your
'Atma' (Soul) rest in peace.
Don't hit me!
Here's your appointment letter.
Thank you. Thank you so much, boss!
But why are you smiling so much?
Did you just remember
Anthony's shock therapy?
No, I just remembered the disastrous
rock therapy on your backside!
Anything for the job, boss.
At least this will
help me settle down.
She'll be very happy-
For how long have you been seeing
each other? - Two years, boss.
She's a very simple girl,
unlike most girls these days.
You know what I mean, right?
First meeting at the yacht and..
I'll take your leave, boss.
Meera is expecting me.
Meera? - Yes. And she lives
up to the name of saint Meera.
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
Lakshman!
Give me Rs.7,000.
That's my Meera.
She's absolutely stunning!
She's the future wife
of this friend of yours.
Look at her with utmost respect!
Give me the money at least.
Meera! Meera!
A for Amplapur.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! You got
the appointment letter!
It's not just an appointment letter.
Think of it as permission for us
to marry, Meera! - Oh, my God!
My family will be so delighted!
Mom, dad, Uncle, Sonappa,
Ponappa"
I only have mom and dad.
And you know Shri. Shri.
Tiruchipalli Radhakrishnan lyer..
The kid?
- Yes, and my favorite..
..great-great-grandfather Bala.
- Bala. - Yes. Bala!
I'm so happy, baby!
- I know, baby.
Listen..
- Yes?
I hope you didn't commit
any fraud to get this job.
Meera! Would I commit a fraud?
I won't do such things.
- Sorry, Lakshman. Sorry.
We'll marry soon.
Don't stand at a distance now.
Come, give me a hug. - Oh, baby!
Meera, how do I tell you
of all that I've done..
..to have a girl as
stunning as you in my life!
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
Sir, I've brought the report.
But I hadn't gone to a doctor.
No, Sir. The dead body
at Blue Cross street..
..was that of Subodh Mehra.
- I see.
Someone killed him
out of personal enmity.
He used to annoy people by
sending them SMSs all the time.
That's why the killer
had broken all his fingers.
But, Sir, I have
some very good news.
You'll dance with joy on
hearing it. - Are you serious?
The guy who was murdered..
..was threatened by none
other than Gopal. - Gopal?
Gopal! Make way! Make way!
"Whether there's something
fishy or the fish is in something."
"I'm amazing, baby. I'm a wonder!"
"Be careful, let no
one steal your heart!"
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
Watch what I do to Gopal.
What are you making?
Your favorite vegetable. Gherkins.
Wow!
What's the matter, Gopal?
You seem to be in a
romantic mood today.
I became romantic the
first time I saw you.
Do you remember our first meeting..
..at your granddad's funeral?
You looked so
beautiful in that white outfit.
Yes. And our second
meeting was at that TV showroom.
I was there to buy a TV.
Even you were looking
very smart that day.
When you took off your glasses..
...I just couldn't
take my eyes off you.
And then, both of us were
down with conjunctivitis..
..for the next four days.
Your eyes had turned so red.
And do you remember how you
followed me when I went to Mumbai?
We had spent the night
on the roof of the car.
It was as if a flood of
love had filled our lives.
Of course! The entire
city was flooded that day.
It was the 26th of July.
Do you remember
the movie we went to?
It was our first comedy movie.
How can I forget?
'Bawariya'! It was so funny.
I remember how you
were gaping at the hero..
..when he took off his towel.
Ekta, you're doubting me again!
Nobody can come between us.
It's a different matter that your
dad thought it necessary to send..
...this 'silent movie' on
our first anniversary.
Your family is no less.
They sent her.
But the bottom line is, 'We
lived happily ever after'.
The story doesn't
end here, my friend.
You've come back?
I'm back, not as your
future brother-in-law..
..but as a
daredevil police inspector!
I'm investigating the
night you'd gone missing..
..because a murder
took place that night.
The night I had come here.
On that ominous night,
a dead body was found..
..on Blue Cross street, right
where the murder was committed.
Do you know whose dead
body it was, Mr. Gopal?
Subodh's!
His murder had taken
place the night before..
..you had threatened to kill Subodh!
You're done for!
- No!
What?
- Gopal is innocent. - Yes.
You too should stop
suspecting Gopal. - Yes. - Why?
Yes, Mads.
That night, Gopal was with his
friend Anthony Gonsalves. - Yes.
Where did this
Anthony Gonsalves turn up?
Here, at our house. Stop
doubting my husband, and get out!
Get out!
- Out!
Why does he open his
mouth when he's mute?
Listen, send Anthony
Gonsalves over to the police station.
I have to take down his statement.
Understood?
Inspector Madhav?
You good-for-nothing banyan tree!
Your lies are taller than you!
But, Sir, I told you
the truth now, didn't I?
But why did you lie to me earlier?
That was for the lie
you told me earlier".
..that certified
you as a liar. Liar!
I hate liars!
And you told me one
lie after the other!
You..
- What's going on?
Hey! What are you doing?
I don't know him!
I hate liars!
- Save me!
Who are you?
- l.. l..
Anthony Talpade!
Anthony Gonsalves.
Did Gopal send you?
- Gopal!
Pinky!
- Pinky! - Yes, Sir!
Go.. take his statement.
- Come.
Liars never go
unpunished from my station.
What have I done?
Who's talking to you?
Get out! Come on!
Take him away. Keep the stool here.
Dare you move!
First, I'll chop off
your hands with a saw..
..and then hack
your legs, and then..
Boss, I've given a false statement,
but I'm petrified..
..because no sooner does
one problem of yours end..
..a new one emerges.
Don't worry, my friend.
Don't be so scared.
We'll handle Madhav
just as we handled Ekta.
No hiccups.
What are you looking at,
buddy? She's way out of your league.
She's a darling, and
you're speechless.
Hi!
Excuse me!
Darn! She's hitting on him.
Nowadays, even phones without
ring-tones are in demand, boss!
Yes. Go, talk to her.
- Go on.
Open what?
Fine, I understood.
Come, let's ruin his day.
Let's make his day.
Excuse me, may I?
- Please.
Thank you.
I'm Gopal Kumar Santoshi.
I'm Anthony. Lakshman Prasad Apte.
And he's Lucky. He
doesn't have a surname.
I'm Daisy.
- Daisy? - Daisy. Daisy!
Daisy Daisy?
Unique name, isn't it, boss?
It's possible.
If we get Lara Dutta
(Indian actress)..
..married to Brian Lara
(West Indian cricketer)..
..what'|| her name be?
Lara Dutta.. Brian Lara.. Lara Lara!
Exacﬂy!
But I hope you aren't married.
- No. - Good!
I'm Lucky's younger brother.
The flirt has started.
- I run Golden Fisheries.
I love sunsets, and
practice power yoga.
I'm a bit of an introvert but..
I like good company and..
Sorry, could you
repeat what you just said?
He said that he loves
watching sunsets with his wife.
He's married.
- Married!
Lucky, why are you so quiet?
Say something.
Say something!
- Say something!
Nana Naani Nano..
No. Actually, the poor fellow..
He's saying that Nana
Patekar (Indian actor) gifted..
..a Nano car to his grandma.
Oh!
- He gifted a Nano to his grandma.
He's a hairstylist, so he
trims everything he says.
How sweet, Lucky!
I was saying..
Excuse me?
Daisy! Daisy!
- Hello!
Daisy Daisy, he's saying something.
Hey, turn around!
Why are you guys standing
behind me? Come to the front.
How will I understand you
if I don't read your lips?
I'm deaf.
Whoever said that love is blind?
Love is mute! Love is deaf!
If the movie 'Black' gets a sequel,
these two are sure to be casted.
What are you doing? What are
you doing? - Leave him! Stop!
What are you doing? Let go!
What are you doing?
Just a moment!
My phone's ringing! My
phone's ringing! Hang on!
Hello! Yes, Meera. Yes.
I'm coming. I am coming.
Boss, Meera is waiting for me
at the mall. I'm leaving. Bye.
I'm leaving too.
Baby!
-Baby!
Good news!
- Good news, baby?
No, not that.
Mom, dad, Sonappa and Chinappa..
..have all agreed to our marriage.
Really?
<i>‘</i> Yes!
We're in a shopping mall. Listen!
- Yes.
They've fixed the wedding for
14th February, Valentine's day!
Really?
- Yes.
And exactly nine months later..
..on 14th November
Children's Day (Indian occasion)..
..there'll be a junior
Lakshman playing in your lap.
Listen! - Tell me. - If we
have a baby girl.. - Tell me.
We'll name her Sridevi.
- What if it's a boy?
We'll call him Rajnikanth Lakshman.
Go away. Go all alone.
Let's find a corner to get cozy.
- In a mall? - Come this way.
Sister-in-law, how is this jacket?
Esha, did you see that?
How's this?
- Yes, baby. Very nice.
Anthony Gonsalves?
Very nice.
- Behave yourself!
Look how he's sticking to her.
- How romantic!
That's why malls
have become so popular!
Fool!
Do you know who he's hugging?
It must be his wife.
She's not his wife.
Julie is his wife.
You weren't around when
she came home the other day.
Baby, aren't these the same
shoes with which you hit me?
Yes, baby. - Esha, Anthony turned
out to be a very immoral fellow.
I have a strong feeling
Gopal and he are making us fools.
What do you mean?
They both were cheating
on their wives that night.
He lied to Julie,
while Gopal lied to me!
They both were together.
But how do we make sure?
By going to Machhi Talao,
Dockyard Lane, Prawns Corner!
Excuse me, where does Anthony stay?
Top floor.
That wretch has hit the jackpot!
Julie..
- Oh, God!
What kind of a woman are you?
You're so frustrated that you
stalked my husband all the way here?
Hey! Mind your language.
We're not like your husband.
Yes, your husband
is having an affair.
I'm absolutely sure that our
husbands are cheating on us.
Yes.
- Oh, God!
I just came here to find out
what exactly happened that night.
ls that so? Wait a minute,
I'll call him.
Anthony, come out!
What are you looking at?
Call your master.
What kind of a servant is he, Julie?
He's not my servant.
This rotten banana
peel is my husband.
Are you Anthony?
'Will you ever tell
anybody that you're Anthony? '
'Don't hit me! '
How many times do
I have to say this?
Who's Anthony? Where's Anthony?
I'm Atmaram. Atmaram.
You!
- Just a moment, Julie.
Why are you forcing your
servant to pose as your husband?
I swear by Jesus Christ! This is
my husband, Anthony Gonsalves.
I'm Anthony Gonsalves!
When I tell the truth,
I get thrashed.
When I lie, I get thrashed.
I'm the one. I'm dead either way.
Do whatever you want! Go on.
Anthony, this is what happens
when you mess around with women.
Really? But Richard, I
didn't get hurt at all.
You didn't get hurt at all? - I just
screamed my head off. - Strange!
Esha, if he's Anthony,
then who was he?
Lakshman, my daughter had
even received a proposal..
..from Subramanium Swami,
the MP (Member of Parliament)..
..from Thiruvananthapuram.
But Meera likes only you.
And now, you even
have a respectable job.
I'm very happy.
You both look as if
you're made for each other.
Just like Lord Shiva and
his consort Goddess Parvati.
Lakshman, what are you
waiting for? Feed her some sweets.
She has yet to apply
henna on her hands.
Oh, God!
Let me feed you some sweetmeat.
- Oh, God!
Anthony Gonsalves?
Where are you taking him?
- You want to get married, do you?
Come, I'll get you
married in prison.
Get in!
What's with the shocked expressions?
Come on, bid farewell to the groom.
I know it must be weird..
..to see a police van
instead of a palanquin..
..and bid adieu to the
groom instead of the bride!
Nothing to worry about. Relax!
What's going on, Mother?
But what crime have I committed?
- You've done nothing.
Your name is
Anthony Gonsalves, right?
Anthony is here. Amar
and Akbar will follow.
And soon, we'll get to watch..
...a movie ('Amar Akbar Anthony',
Indian movie) together. Excellent!
Mom! Dad! Chinappa!
Lakshman, what have you done?
I haven't done anything. Save me!
Don't leave me at his mercy.
Boss, my engagement will break..
Why are you crying?
"Do you wanna partner.. 0 partner..
Love me, love me say."
Boss.. Get lost!
Gopal, you threatened to
kill Subodh, the fellow..
..who kept sending text messages.
And then, you went missing
on the night of his murder!
To top that, you introduced your
real wife to the fake Anthony.
And to top even that, you made the
fake Anthony give a false statement!
You're great, buddy!
And the funniest part is that
this case has come to the cop..
..who's your enemy. Me!
In short, you're dead. So sad!
Boss, we all are in a fix
because of your philandering nature.
Shut up!
Get lost!
- I have to give you one first.
The government says so. Give me one.
Madhav, the truth is that..
...I rescued a girl that night.
I spent the night with
her on a friend's yacht.
Who's she? Where does she live?
If we look for her, we'll find her.
Give us some time.
Okay, you have 15 minutes.
Go find her.
Am I a fool to give
you guys time? Rogues!
Kiss him!
Madhav..
- Yes?
Have you forgotten?
- What?
Esha!
Madhav, don't put your
personal life at stake..
..for the sake of
your professional life.
Gopal, this isn't fair.
I'll give you time.
Sir, please open it.
Gopal! Just three days
for the three of you.
Three days?
- Yes, in English.
If only we were more in number!
We'd have gotten more time, right'?
I'm there for you, am I not?
- Shut up!
If you don't find that girl
in three days then remember..
..that I don't love Esha
as much as I hate you!
Wow! What a dialogue!
Three days!
Get out!
Ekta.. - Madhav called me
up and told me everything.
Madhav, that darn..
Baby, I know you're hurt.
But why do you have to leave home?
I won't let you go. You
can't leave this house and go.
I'm not leaving the house. You are!
This is your baggage, not mine.
You'll sleep on the lawn
till you find that girl.
How can you do this to me?
I'm your husband. - Shut up!
Keep in mind, find the
girl in three days..
..or our marriage of three years..
Ekta!
Hey, come on, girls!
It's party time! Let's rock.
What will you have? Come on!
- Beer! - Beer!
Hey, Baljeet!
Gopal, my friend! You've
come at the right time.
We're going for a high sea adventure.
It'll be great fun. Come on!
Girls, liquor, great fun! Hop on!
See? Your brother-in-law is a
flirt and his friend is worse.
No, thanks. I had
some work with you.
What is it? Tell me, buddy.
I was here with a girl last Friday.
I'm looking for her,
but I can't find her.
Was she here by any chance?
No. But were you here Friday night?
No wonder
everything was so messed up!
Everything was in a mess.
Listen to that! Why are
you turning your face away?
Your brother-in-law
indulges in cheap acts..
..with cheap girls, and I
have to bear the brunt of it!
What's the deal? What
did you do with her?
Let it go, buddy. Thanks.
Look at me. I said, look at me.
- What's going on?
Tell him directly. Why
do you always backbite?
Nothing, boss. I've got a call.
Okay, Baljeet. Enjoy yourself.
Bye, Gopal! - Bye! - Why are
you sticking to him? - Meera?
Lakshman, why did
the police arrest you?
Meera.. - Are you involved in
drugs? Or the underworld? - Meera..
Did you rape somebody?
Meera, I'm not alone in this.
You mean, gang rape?
Gang rape? What nonsense,
Meera! At least, hear me out.
I swear to you, I'm notorious..
I'm not guilty!
This is the first time
in our family history..
..that cops have come home.
Enough, Meera! Everybody including
you knows that I never lie.
Actually, my boss is involved
in a case concerning a girl..
..and in the process of helping,
I too got entangled.
But once we find that contemptible,
horrible girl..
...all the problems will be solved.
Trust me, baby.
Boss, you're too much!
Why didn't you ask that date of
yours for her name or phone number?
You got a chance,
and you jumped the gun!
What is it?
Women's Day
celebration at the Central Mall.
70% discount on all products.
70%! That means your
girl will surely come there.
But it's exclusively for women.
No men. - No men?
Oh..
- No!
"Fishy, Fishy..
Everything's going to be Fishy."
"Fishy, Fishy..
Everything's going to be Fishy."
"Fishy, Fishy..
Everything's going to be Fishy."
"Fishy, Fishy..
Everything's going to be Fishy."
She's nowhere to be seen.
Shall we check upstairs?
- Come on!
Excuse me! Thank you. Which floor?
Lift!
- Stop!
I'm so sorry Gopal
turned out to be such a flirt.
If he doesn't find that girl,
will you kick him out of the house?
Exactly! He deserves it.
Will you throw me out, too?
Of course not, silly! Why would I?
You'll stay with me.
- Thank you, Sister-in-law.
You're so sweet. Gopal
should be ashamed of himself!
I'm ashamed to call him my brother.
How sad! It'll be fine, okay?
"Fishy.."
Sister-in-law!
Excuse me. Where's
the clothing section?
Shut up!
Please excuse my friend.
She's made in China.
Luck.. Lucy Liu.
- Liu. Lucy Liu?
The clothing section
must be to your left!
You're right. Sister-in-law,
she's so intelligent. - Thank you.
Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.
My sister is complaining about me!
I'll give her.. Ekta,
you dropped your mobile.
That was Gopal's voice.
Yes, that was Gopal's voice!
Gopal! Oh, my God!
Gopal's voice!
- Oh, my God! I want Gopal.
I want Gopal, Mom!
Gopal knows them too?
Brother is so shameless.
He knows them too. Come on.
Mom, I want Gopal! Where's Gopal,
Mom? Tell me, please.
What happened?
How will you do it here?
We'll have to go to
the ladies washroom.
Boss! Boss!
Boss, my girlfriend is here!
When my wife didn't recognize me,
how can your girl recognize you?
Let's go.
Go to the gents' washroom.
No, you'll be caught. Go
to the ladies' washroom.
Tell him that by
changing one's outfit..
..the person's
gender doesn't change!
Have some shame! If he
goes to the ladies' washroom..
Go to the ladies' washroom.
No, go to the gents' washroom.
- Go on!
It seems as though it's
going to snow in the mall.
This is Madhav.
- How do you know?
He's played this
game earlier as well.
Let's
Wretch!
Boss, he'll surely get us trapped.
- Excuse me!
Gopal.
- Yes?
I knew it!
Did you find the girl?
- No.
Just two days left!
Do you want to go to the washroom?
You'll be in the
lock-up in two days!
Why isn't it snowing here?
Boss, just one more night to go.
After that, we'll have
to do this behind bars.
It's been two days, but your
brazen, god forsaken date..
..is nowhere to be found.
How will we spend the
night if we don't find her?
Hey!
GOpaI!
From the 'man of the house'..
...you've become the
'man out of the house'.
From a penthouse, you're
living in a tent house.
I'm feeling very bad, buddy.
- It's all because of you.
Yes, I can't help
but take the credit.
Never mind.
So, did you find your girl?
Not yet? Shall I go
meet my girl then?
You..
- No! - Let go of me!
I know that she's your sister..
..but I can't let go of such an
opportunity! - She's my sister!
Romantic song with violence!
Yes, baby!
Where will he run off to?
I'll get you for this!
"Baby's got a move in you,
sexy and I'm feeling you."
"Though your body's moving,
get this body jumping."
"Baby's got a move in you,
sexy and I'm feeling you."
"Though your body's moving,
get this body jumping."
"Baby's got a move in you,
sexy and I'm feeling you."
"Though your body's moving,
get this body jumping."
"Baby's got a move in you,
sexy and I'm feeling you."
"Though your body's moving,
get this body jumping."
"Say hey.. , I say
move to the B, I swear."
"Shake it shake it shake it,
yao shake it all around."
"Shake it shake it shake it,
yao shake it all around."
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"My heart is on fire, the
weak-hearted will perish."
"You're ignorant, someone
please make him understand."
"Don't be stubborn."
"Listen to me carefully."
"l too was ignorant and
now I'm trapped in his love."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Make way! Make way!"
"Hey you! Make way! Make way!"
"l follow my heart.
I'm not afraid to die."
"There's nothing you can do
once I've made up my mind."
"What do I say? My
life is in grave danger."
"I'm scared, I'm suffering,
as I desire only you."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Moving"
"Moving."
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Make way!"
"Hey you! Make way!"
"I won't spare you, even
if it costs me my life."
"I've come to get you, I
won't leave without you."
"My crazy lover, how
do I explain it to you?"
"I've lost my heart to you.
I'm at your mercy."
"Come into my arms, my love..
..after you've confessed
your love for me to the world."
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with

"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make way! Don't mess with
me or you'll be done for!"
"Make Way!"
Gopal, what happened?
You look worried.
No, Sir. Subodh Mehra's
provident fund file is ready.
You need to sign it.
Yes. Drop it in my cabin, please.
Okay, Sir.
Who do you think killed him?
He didn't have any enemy.
- Except you.
Did you.. I mean, only
you used to fight with him.
I'm just kidding, Gopal.
Make sure you send me the file.
- Yes, Sir.
Hello!
- Give it to me. Come on.
ls Lakshman there, buddy?
Give it to him.
Talk! No, go ahead!
Boss, type my promotion letter
along with my appointment letter.
What for?
The girl with whom you sang..
..'Ding-dong' (a Hindi
movie song) all night long..
..is sitting in front of me.
I'm calling from her house.
How did you find her?
Don't ask questions.
Take down the address.
Where's she?
She.. she's not that girl.
Hey, sweetheart! I like you.
What are you talking about?
You forgot me?
Take a good look. I'm the same girl.
Remember, when we were
walking down the street..
..a few goons teased me.
And then, you fought them all.
You beat them black and blue,
and then we went on the yacht and..
I like you!
No. Have you undergone
plastic surgery, ma'am?
What's he saying?
- Wait, I'll explain.
No, Lakshman. The story is correct,
but the cast is wrong.
Lucky, your brother-in-law
hasn't forgotten her face yet.
I'm sure she must have been
unforgettable. What say, loverboy?
Boss, only you know
that she's not the one.
Madhav has no clue.
After she gives her statement, our
problem with Madhav will be solved!
As far as the night on
the yacht is concerned..
..she'll censor all of that.
Ekta's problem will
also be taken care of.
If I can pose as Anthony, why
can't Munni pose as that girl?
You'll just have to pay
her Rs.3 lakh. - What? - Yes.
I like you. You'd promised
to give me only Rs.2 lakh.
Rs.1 lakh more for my make-up?
- Shut up!
Boss, I was going to
give her Rs.2 lakh but..
It was his idea to get
Rs.3 lakh from you..
..and split the
extra cash between us!
Did you see that? You
can keep the extra cash.
I refuse to be a part
of your fraudulence.
It was his idea, boss. I
was trying to bargain..
I'd heard that friendship
is stronger than blood ties.
Blood ties don't matter.
No, boss. Friendship is
the ultimate relationship.
I won't spare you, you rogues!
- No, boss!
Wretches, I'll kill you!
Jesus, I like them. So cute!
Vasooli!
Munni!
- Vasooli!
Munni!
- Vasooli!
Tell me, how do I look?
You look gorgeous, darling!
How's my lover?
- I've gone cold without you.
Then listen to some hot news.
The money has been arranged.
What are you saying?
- The money has been arranged.
That's what I'm saying.
Tomorrow, you'll be
freed from prison, and then..
And then, underneath the blue sky,
far away, we'll buy a plot..
..and build our
house of dreams, Munni.
And the interiors of the
house will be done in blue.
"Ever since your eyes met mine.."
- What's going on?
Nothing. Go back. Vasooli is
singing. - "Eyes met mine."
"Our eyes met.."
"Ever since your eyes met mine.."
Munni! - You sing really well!
- I do, don't I?
Wow! You all look so relaxed.
Resting, munching on apples..
Very good! Gopal, it's time
for the climax of the movie.
The movie isn't over yet, my friend.
Does your movie
begin after the climax?
I've found my girl.
Darn! I hate it!
Munni!
- Come inside.
Munni!
- Munni! - Munni!
Munni!
- Munni! - Munni! - Munni! - Munni!
Hey, Munni!
- Munni!
Gopal, these aren't my words.
They're Munni's.
'You used me thoroughly,
but I didn't object.'
'You kept me like a mistress.
How cheap! '
'But I didn't object.'
'You committed so many
frauds in the company.'
'But I didn't object.' Thank you.
'But after mercilessly
murdering Subodh Mehra..
you want me to falsely testify
that you were with me that night? '
'No way! I hate you,
Gopal.' I hate you too.
'I'm leaving town. Munni.'
Madhav, Esha must
be waiting at home.
Are you serious?
- I'm her brother. - Really?
But who can let go of such
an opportunity? - Correct!
Had it been a little bigger, I'd
have slung it around your neck.
Listen Madhav, I've done nothing
I'm sure Subodh Mehra's
murderer has kidnapped Munni.
I've been framed.
In that case, thank the
murderer on my behalf.
I like him. Yes!
See, Madhav? An Indian wife
can never let go of her husband!
Fights and arguments come later,
husbands come first.
She has even brought a
lawyer to bail me out.
Why are you bailing him out? Ekta!
Gopal, he isn't a criminal lawyer,
but a divorce lawyer.
Now, it's up to you whether we
do this through mutual consent..
..or fight it out in court.
A divorce case, along
with a criminal case!
Buy one, and get one free.
Indian women are great!
Ekta, I swear I
haven't murdered anybody.
I haven't cheated on you either.
Thank you, Ekta.
- Ekta!
You're feeling lonely, right?
I'll do you a favor. I'll get
you your two buddies for company.
"Whether there's something
fishy or the fish is in something."
"I'm amazing, baby. I'm a wonder!"
"Be careful, let no
one steal your heart!"
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
I'm talking about you.
Which is the company
you're exactly working for?
My company?
- Which racket are you involved in?
Racket? Meera, I haven't even
touched a tennis racquet till now.
I'm telling the truth.
Say something.
Let it be. I'll explain.
I guess I'll have to
tell you the truth.
Actually, it's my shameless boss
and his brother-in-law Gopal..
..who has put us in
this sticky situation.
Meera, the cops suspect that
he murdered someone last Friday.
But the boss says that he was at
the Red Rhino disco that Friday..
..and that when he left the place,
he saw a few goons..
..harassing a girl
on Blue Cross street.
And then, he rescued
that girl, calmed her down..
..and took her onto a
yacht at Malegaon beach?
Yes, but how do you know all this?
Has a movie been made on it already?
I'm that girl.
You?
-Yes.
You're the one!
Why did this have to
happen to me, Lord?
I'm doomed!
My life is ruined!
Meera is that girl!
Why, Meera is that girl!
Meera, for God's sake, for my sake,
just for the heck of it..
..tell me that it's a lie!
Say that it's a lie!
It's the truth!
Why me? No!
You should be happy.
- Happy? Yes, right!
The girl who you've
been looking for..
..is standing right in front of you.
Why should I be happy?
Am I getting married?
Meera, this means that Gopal and
you.. that night on the yacht..
No!
Tell me, in which ICU ward
is your family admitted?
Book a bed for me as well.
I can't take this!
Shut up!
Just because a man and
a woman spent a night..
..together at the same place..
..doesn't mean that
something happened between them.
How could you even
think of such a thing?
Gopal is innocent..
..and I'm going to the police
station to give my statement.
One more thing..
- ls it loose?
Love and trust
should go hand in hand.
You shouldn't marry me
if you can't trust me.
I don't want Gopal and his wife's
story being repeated in my life.
Meera..
- It's all because of suspicion!
Suspicion! What the..
Meera.. Meera..
Look, Meera, I'm really very sorry.
I made a huge mistake,
Meera. I'll never again doubt you.
I promise. Sorry.
Wear this, please. Please?
Whoever gave you
this ring? I'm kidding!
Sorry. Let's go to
the police station.
What are you laughing for?
Just because a man and a
woman spent a night together..
..doesn't mean that
something happened between them.
She just said that a man and a
woman spending a night together..
..doesn't mean that
something happened between them.
Stop laughing!
- What are you doing?
Look at me.
- What are you doing?
Nothing, darling. He takes a
little while to understand things.
Look at me!
Just because a man and a woman
spent a night together doesn't..
..mean that something happened
between them. Do you understand?
Let go!
. Hey! _ Yes?
Where's my Munni (girl)?
- Has your daughter gone missing?
Not my daughter.
My sweetheart Munni.
Vasooli's Munni.
I just got released from jail.
- Munni?
Sir, we have no idea
where she is either.
Give me your cellphone number.
I'll give you a missed
call as soon as I find her.
Missed call? Cellphone?
Ever since Munni became
a part of your network..
..she's been out
of reach. Who's she?
She's not Munni.
- Leave me!
You can't do this. You can't take
the 'Kaanoon' (Law) in your hands.
So, her name's 'Kaanoon'?
Now, wait for Vasooli's verdict.
- Please..
Lakshman! - Send Munni and
take your 'Kaanoon' in exchange.
I have a gun! I'll kill you.
Come on, 'Kaanoon'!
- What are you doing? Meera!
My cellphone number is 9002200001.
Don't be afraid, I'm there.
I've already said that.
Inspector!
Wretches! I'll shoot both of you.
- Just a moment.
We found the girl.
- Which girl?
Meera.
- Who's Meera?
The one who spent
the night with Gopal.
That was Munni.
- No, she was a part of our plan.
Which plan is Meera a part of?
She's my girlfriend, Sir.
Enough!
- Send Meera over.
Vasooli took her away, Sir.
Who's Vasooli?
- He's Munni's boyfriend.
If he's Munni's boyfriend,
he should take Munni away.
Why did he take Meera?
Because he wants Munni, Sir.
That's why. Sir, what happened is..
He's crazy!
- Mads, enough!
Baby!
- Not now!
Are you planning to put my
entire family behind bars?
I want to put them in a
mental asylum, but I have..
..to make do with a jail.
Enough, Mads!
- Enough, Mads!
Why are you sounding like a guy?
- Mads! - Yes?
Gopal's my brother.
- So sad!
He's so tense these days,
and instead of helping him..
..you're always out to get him.
- I'm so sorry.
Mads, free Gopal. - He's already
free. How can I free him then?
His MD, Mr. Sawant, bailed
him out and took him along.
Then, we should catch up with them.
- Why?
Because the boss has a
knack of going from..
..the frying pan into the fire!
Thanks for the bail, Sir.
Anytime, Gopal.
But where are we going?
- Lover's Point.
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
Hey! That's the boss and his boss.
But why are they
going to Lover's Point?
ls he like..
Poor Ekta!
She always thought that
Gopal had affairs with girls.
I must inform Ekta.
Ekta, get to Lover's
Point immediately.
You don't know what Gopal has done.
Hello! Vasooli, come fast
to Lover's Point with Meera!
Do you want to call up somebody?
Oh, God! Crazy family!
Sir, why have we come here?
I'd like to show you something
before answering your question.
Come.
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
It's for you.
Read it.
'I, Gopal, in my complete senses,
admit that I've.. '
I've killed Subodh Mehra?
-Subodh.
'It's because he found
out that I smuggle drugs.'
'But now, I've
realized my mistake..
. And so, I'm
committing suicide.' Suicide?
Are you going to
commit suicide, Gopal?
Sir, I haven't written this.
But the handwriting is yours, right?
Yes, it is. But I
haven't written this, Sir!
Maybe you haven't, Gopal.
But how are you going to
prove that after your death?
Subodh Mehra found out
that Mr. Sawant exports drugs.
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
Faster!
"Fishy.. Fishy.."
So, I exported him to heaven.
You were a suspect for the
murder right from day one.
In order to prove it, I kidnapped
Munni and also forged this letter.
Yes! I knew it!
'Golden Fisheries'
smuggles drugs. I knew it!
I'm a great policeman!
- Yes.
But that also means
Gopal is innocent, Mads.
Yes.
- Darn it!
Munni! What I need in order to get
my Meera released is right here.
Vasooli's coming here too.
Take a look, Gopal. The
noose is awaiting you.
You could have taken
that off yourself!
Mads..
- Yes? - Come on.
Where?
- Otherwise, Gopal will be hanged.
L.. - Let's go save him.
- I don't think so.
The problem is that I wasted
all my bullets on these two.
I have a gun, but it's empty.
What?
- Sorry!
Careful!
Hurry UP!
Gopal, wait!
Let my husband go.
He may cheat on me, but
he's my husband after all.
I'm so glad you came!
We were so worried.
We looked all over for you!
I'm here, loverboy. I'm the
girl Gopal spent the night with.
And I like him.
- Hey, Munni!
Not you! Ekta, she's the girl.
Lakshman, my friend, she's the girl!
She's the girl I spent
the night with! It's her!
Take a good look,
Madhav. She is the one.
Yes, Inspector. I'm the girl
who spent the night with him.
No!
So cheap! ls he your brother? Flirt!
Gopal, I have no
reason left to live now.
I'm going to commit suicide.
Ekta!
- Sister-in-law! - Ekta!
This noose isn't designed for you.
Give me your hand, step down.
Have you gone mad?
Please, save her.
- Why?
She's going to hang herself.
- I asked her to leave Gopal..
What? - ..but she didn't
listen to me. Silly girl!
Put Gopal back on the platform.
I didn't spend the
night with two women!
We had hired one of
them to play the part.
What about the other one?
- The other one..
I was with the other one, but..
You don't have an answer, do you?
Baby, save her!
Wow, boss! Bad butterfly!
Was Gopal with Meera as well?
Not you, him!
Well done, boss! You've
finally spoken the truth.
What are you blabbering about?
I didn't do anything.
Then why do you smile..
..every time I ask
you about that night?
Did you see that?
That's because I have a
smiling face ever since childhood.
Shut up!
A smiling face?
Do I look like a fool to you?
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law,
step down. Let me hang.
Somebody has to die.
I'll die. - Listen..
It is better I die. - Where are
you going? What are you doing?
Step down, Lakshman!
- What?
I'm sorry. I'm your boss's boss.
Listen to me. Come down,
let Gopal hang.
Get lost! To heck with my boss!
Lakshman, stop right there!
- Gopal..
Shut up, wretch!
Ma'am, please listen..
- Get off, rogue!
I should be the one dying for
having loved a guy like you.
I explained to you so much.
Yet you doubt me.
Give it to me, I want to die.
- What are you doing?
It'll break!
- Just a moment.
At least, tell them the
truth before you die. - Sure.
Ekta, I swear on God..
..nothing happened between
Gopal and me that night.
I told you!
- Your husband is innocent.
But I don't know what transpired
between that wretched woman and him!
Lord 'Murugan'
(Hindu deity), I'm coming.
Get lost!
- Leave. - God, I'm coming.
Wait!
I'm finished now.
- I can understand.
This wretch didn't
spare your lover either!
Go, hang yourself.
Hey! Where are you going?
Sir, I can only request you..
'Kaanoon', dear,
give me that noose.
Munni, I should be the one dying.
I loved you and
thought of you as my own.
But you betrayed me,
taking me to be a fool!
No!
- Oh, God!
I have no reason to live now!
Give it to me. I want to die.
The one for whom I put on
layers of make-up everyday..
..that Vasooli
doubts me. I hate you!
But I want to clarify
something before I die.
Look, ma'am, I'm not having
an affair with your husband.
What are you saying?
- Nothing happened that night.
This fellow gave me money
to do the act. - Wretch!
I was always chaste, I'm chaste.
But won't remain anymore..
..because I'm dying.
Munni! Munni, don't be
so silly. You'll die!
Enough!Enough!
Stop it! Nobody dare move!
Fools! The cops have
surrounded this place..
..from one side. And
don't you see this?
It's a gun. I'll shoot you!
Stand straight!
This is cheating. You told me
there aren't any bullets in it.
Fool! Why did you
have to tell them that?
You're the biggest fool! And
I'm a bigger fool to love you.
God, please help me!
Where are you going? Sorry!
Brother, let me die. I
don't wish to live anymore.
What are you doing, Esha?
How dare you make my sister cry!
There aren't any bullets in it.
- Darn it!
Shut up!
- You all are good for nothing.
What's going on?
Shut up, all of you!
Somebody tell me, what's going on!
I'll go crazy.
- Hang yourself. - Get up!
I asked you to bring a
few of your goons along.
Now who will handle
this troop of lunatics?
He's calling us lunatics!
- I've decided.
Only one person shall die!
- Who?
Me!
- I'll help you.
I want salvation! - Come on.
Thank you. Thank you, Gopal.
I'm coming!
Bring me down!
What are you angry about now?
Gopal is innocent, Madhav.
I may watch serials, but
my husband isn't a killer.
Boss, control your anger for now.
If your sister marries a cop..
..he'll be able to
rescue you in the future.
Come on, Mads. Shake
hands with brother.
Only then will you get
my hand in marriage.
Shake hands, Sir.
-Enough!
Not so high, a little lower..
Towards the left..
Yes!
- It's okay.
Wow! What the Lord
has brought about!
Sorry.
- It's okay.
Sorry, Ekta. I lied to you.
You lied because I
always suspected you.
Gopal, I promise I won't
watch soaps from today.
Good!
- Yes! - Correct!
Soaps are highly contagious!
Did you catch yesterday's episode
of ‘Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi‘?
Tulsi's new husband arrived.
What? Who?
They haven't disclosed that yet.
Tonight, the big secret will be out!
Come on! There's still time.
What the hell was that?
'Balaji' (Balaji Telefilms,
an Indian production house)!
Sawant was punished for his deeds.
As they say, what
comes around goes around!
And now, I, Babloo Pachisiya, as
the owner of Golden Fisheries..
..it's my duty to
introduce to my employees..
..the new managing
director of the company.
Congratulations, boss.
You've become the MD.
Congratulations to you as well.
You're going to take my place.
Of course.
A big round of applause for
the new managing director.
Dad!
Hi.
- Hello.
Lucky is the new Managing Director..
..and also my future son-in-law.
When the lovers have
made up their minds..
..there's little a fool can do.
- Dad!
Oh, my God! You're going to be
a big man now, almost a VIP!
That's why, for your security..
..inspector Madhav
will accompany you 24/7.
Gopal and Lakshman
will work under you.
Much lower.
Okay, carry on.
Move!
He's our boss?
Wretch! In the first one,
he took the girl.
In the second, he stole the job.
And in the third?
Will he even be there in the third?
What nonsense!
You can't kick me
out of the third film..
..just because I played
a mute in the first two.
That's not happening! Never!
I have a contract for three movies.
I haven't even increased my price!
Rohit! Rohit, tell them!
This is downright injustice!
They can't do this to me!
Look, what they're doing to me!
"Fishy.."
