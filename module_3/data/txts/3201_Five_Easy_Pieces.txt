I'm gonna play it again.
You play that thing one more time,
I'm gonna melt it down into hair spray.
Let me play
the other side then.
No, Rayette,
it's not a question of sides.
It's a question
of musical integrity.
Then let me sing one for ya.
<i>When there's a...</i>
Hold it, hold it.
- Oh, Bobby!
- What?
Quit that now.
You said you're gonna help me
pick a song.
- I did?
- I'm gonna cut off your damn water.
I swear.
Selfish.
You can play on the piano.
Your whole damn family can play
some type of musical instrument.
All I'm askin' is for you
to help me improve my musical talent.
And you'd think you would.
Dipesto, why don't you
take that sign off your tit...
and you and me go out
and have us a real good time.
Where are we going?
I don't know, but I'll holler up
to Elton and Stoney.
Bobby, now listen a minute.
You know, I'll go out with you...
or I'll stay in with you...
or I'll do anything
that you'd like for me to do...
if you would tell me
that you love me.
You can sing the song.
You are never satisfied.
That's right.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
All right, here it is.
They were all set up right for ya.
Get right in there, Dipesto.
- Just relax.
- Come on, Rayette.
Watch that left foot.
Left foot forward.
Not too much of a match,
is it, Elton?
In the gutter.
Isn't that wonderful?
Too heavy for me, honey.
The pins, you know. I can't see them.
I can't make 'em out.
Squint. I squint.
There they are at the end
of these little boards.
You notice 'em leading down,
just spot and follow through.
But there's so many.
- What's that for?
- That's for luck.
- Oh, you're crazy.
- Go show Ray how to do it.
- You slobbered on me.
- It ain't the first time.
Watch this.
There she is. She's doin'
a little variation on the Apache Shift.
I taught her that.
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at ya, honey.
It'll be all right.
- Look at me and tell me you're not mad.
- I'm not mad at you.
- Let's see you beat it.
- I'll show you how it gets done.
Don't talk about it. Do it.
Isn't he pretty?
Show me something.
Give me spirit. Give me something.
That stupid thing
just goes all cocky-wobbly, honey.
- Just do what I tell ya.
- I did, didn't I, EI?
You got another ball coming.
- Come on!
- Relax, Ray. That's all.
Attaboy!
That was real good, wasn't it?
I finally did it.
Great. You throw the big Zs
for 19 frames...
and then you throw a strike
on the last ball of a losin' game.
Just wonderful.
Wasn't that wonderful, ladies?
- Are you talking to us?
- Wonderful.
I guess I'll go wait in the car.
Why don't you go wait in the car?
I will.
I'll wait there right now.
One minute, honey,
and I'll go with you.
Me and Stoney got to get on home,
relieve the sitter.
Why don't you and Ray
just come on by the place?
All right, why don't you go on?
Here, I'll take care
of the beers.
And would you walk Rayette
with ya?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
- What do we owe you?
- Four dollars, sir.
Okay.
- Here's a five. Thanks very much.
- Thank you.
We've been wanting to ask you.
You're on the TV, aren't ya?
Am I?
She says you're the guy
that sells all the cars on TV.
I might have sold a few cars.
I told ya! My name's Shirley,
but they call me Betty.
Her name's Twinky.
- Twinky?
- Yeah, 'cause she's so Twinky.
Boy, oh, boy.
Well, Betty and Twinky...
it sure is nice
talking to you girls.
I wish I had some more time.
- That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
- Me?
Yeah, I told her it was you,
but that you're wearing a wig...
'cause on TV,
you're mostly all bald up there.
Your friend's real, real sharp.
I don't wear the wig on TV...
because if you're gonna be in front of
two and a half million people...
you've got to be sincere.
I mean, I like to wear it when I'm in
bowling alleys and slipping around.
I think it gives me a little class.
What do you think?
Yeah, but I can see
a little bit of the net up there.
That's what give it away.
A little net.
I wish I had more time
to talk to you girls...
but I have to...
I'll...
Come on, Ray.
We're gonna go over to Elton's.
I'm not.
You're just gonna sit here?
Yes.
Okay, I hope
no one hits on you.
I hope they do.
Okay.
See you later.
No one would want to hit on you.
You look too pathetic.
Come on, Dipesto.
We can still have a good time.
You're the pathetic one,
not me.
I'm going over to Elton's.
I am not a piece of crap.
I'm sorry.
You treat me like I was.
Go slip around
right before my face...
in front of Elton and Stoney
that way.
What do you imagine they think
of somebody you treat like that?
Now, now, Ray.
Sweetheart, Elton and Stoney know
that I love you.
They're just gonna think that I'm not
too nice a guy, which I'm not...
and that you're a real hell of
a good person for puttin' up with me.
That's all.
Just find me dead one time.
You'll just kill me.
Come on, be a good girl.
If you ever really get up
and leave me...
you'll read about it
in the newsprint.
I'm not gonna get up
and leave you.
Now, come on.
Let's go over to Elton's
and have a good time.
You love me, Bobby?
What do you think?
Fuck.
You got banana on your face.
I do?
I still ain't figured out
how you got me workin' back out here.
I got you to work out here?
I ain't figured out how you let me
get you to work on these rigs.
I've never worked on these before.
You've worked on 'em before.
I can't figure out
how you let me get us out here.
Somebody had to look out for ya.
You're a mess.
You're crazy.
- I'm gonna bet two dollars right off.
- I'm in.
I think you're bullshitting me.
- What have you got?
- Pair of nines.
- Can you beat two pair?
- There's three aces right there.
I got me a hand.
It's time for me to go home.
See you in the mornin'.
See you in the morning.
I don't know if I'm goin' out there
tomorrow at all.
I got a lot of money
tied up in everything I've got.
I don't want no chains
going around and all this.
It's all right,
but I prefer cardplaying.
Where is it? What the hell is going on
in the middle of this game?
People talking and all.
We got money here or what?
<i>Ride a cockhorse</i>
<i>to Banbury Cross</i>
<i>Ride a cockhorse</i>
<i>to Banbury Cross</i>
<i>To Banbury Cross</i>
<i>we go</i>
When I was four...
just four years old...
I went to my mother...
and I said,
"What's this hole in my chin?"
I saw this dimple in my chin
and didn't know what it was.
Get what my mother says.
She says, "When you're born,
you go on an assembly line past God.
If He likes you,
He says, 'You cute little thing'...
and you get dimples there.
If He doesn't like you,
He goes, 'Go away."'
So, about six months later,
my mother caught me saying my prayers.
I was going, "Now I lay me
down to sleep."
Mother says, "What are you
covering up your chin for?"
And I said, "Because if I cover up
the hole, maybe He'll listen to me."
I look unfit to you, Elton?
I'm fit!
<i>If you haven't got your ticket yet</i>
<i>you'd better order it</i>
<i>He'll wet your carpet</i>
<i>and he'll fertilize your grass</i>
<i>He's got three white feet</i>
<i>and a hole in his ass</i>
Don't you know no songs
about women or nothin'?
Yeah, but I'm just too loaded
to think of 'em now.
Watch out for all this traffic.
Watch out for all this traffic.
- Oh, God.
- I ain't in no hurry.
Believe starting off your day
like this, going to work?
Unbelievable.
Let me have a drink, will ya?
Thanks, EI.
Oh, boy, that's tough
in the morning.
What the hell
are these people doing here?
Isn't this some goddamn thing?
Jesus Christ!
I can't stand this goddamn freeway.
I heard ya! Why don't you
flash your lights...
so we can see
what else you got for Christmas?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where you going?
Why don't we all line up
like a goddamn bunch of ants...
in the most beautiful part
of the day!
Hey, get off my car.
Oh, shit. What's he doing?
Play it!
Quit foolin' around!
Come on!
Bobby, he's turning!
Will you hold your horses?
I was with Elton
last night, Rayette.
It's the truth.
You son of a bitch.
Natalie, be quiet.
Come on, reach for it.
Come on. Good girl.
- Isn't he sweet?
- I can't see the set.
You take him for a while.
Go ahead now.
How ya doin'?
You ought to get yourself
one of them little things.
That's it. He crushed that one too.
Then I won't get any.
<i>Bless my soul.</i>
<i>It's a new harmonica.</i>
- <i>That's for your birthday.</i>
- <i>My birthday?</i>
<i>How do you know when my birthday is?</i>
<i>I don't know myself.</i>
The kitchen's on fire, Stoney.
Your mother's just died.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- See ya, Elton.
So long.
<i>Incidentally,</i>
<i>what's his name?</i>
You just love that little baby,
don't you?
Well, what if she was?
I can't see nothing
so bad in that.
Well, what if I were to let you in
on a little secret that she is?
That's right.
She told me.
She's all torn up about it, too,
which I hate to see.
Isn't it something
you just have to face up to?
I'll tell ya, somewhere along the line,
you even get to likin' the whole idea.
When Stoney first give me the news,
I could've shit.
Well, isn't that nice?
It's ridiculous.
I'm listening to some cracker asshole
who lives in a trailer park...
compare his life to mine.
Keep on telling me about the good life,
because it makes me puke.
If you're saying you're something
better than I am, that's something else.
But I can't say much of someone...
who could leave a woman
in a situation like this...
and feel easy about it.
That's all I have to say.
I'm glad that's all
you got to say...
because I'm about
as goddamn tired of your mouth...
as I am working
on the goddamn job!
Shit ass!
Hey, Longcipher!
I'm quitting.
Do you hear me?
I said I'm quitting.
I don't give a damn
what you do.
I'm glad to get rid
of both of you dumb guys.
Hey, what's going on?
Don't do that, Bob.
Don't mix in.
They've got the right, Bob.
It's the law.
Don't you think
you could just leave him?
If he had known who you were,
he wouldn't have done that. Would you?
What the hell's going on?
All right, let him go.
What's going on?
I got accused of robbing
a filling station. Didn't I tell ya?
I just got wild
and jumped my bail.
They come runnin' at me a whole year
later. Isn't that something?
Tell Stoney for me, ya hear?
Hi. Miss Dupea?
- Upstairs. Up those stairs.
- Thank you.
There she goes again.
My one-year-old can carry a tune
better than that.
Miss Dupea.
- Miss Dupea.
- Yes?
I'd like to remind you again
that this is not an opera...
or a musical comedy.
Sorry. Was I singing again?
If you want to call it that.
Wait. You have simply to tell me.
That's all.
That's exactly
what I am doing again.
Must you let me get two thirds
of the way through the movement?
- This is tiring me.
- I have another suggestion.
- Why don't we take a break?
- For pity's sake.
- Is she gonna cry again?
- I don't wanna take a break.
Some coffee. What would you like
in your coffee, Miss Dupea?
- Tea.
- One tea.
Tell her Bobby's here.
Bobby's here.
Oh, my goodness!
Robert Eroica.
I can't look at you.
Well, don't, then.
You always do this to me.
I don't mean to.
Here's your tea, Tita.
Thank you.
Don't put it there.
Why? What's wrong?
This is a very special CB 275.
No kidding.
It has absolutely
no objectionable idiosyncrasies.
I have to talk seriously to you.
Everybody still living
up on the island?
Well, at the moment,
there's really just...
Daddy, Carl and myself,
and Van Oost.
- Who's Van Oost?
- Catherine.
She's a pianist.
She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler.
What's he doing coaching piano?
Well, eleven months ago...
he was on his bicycle on his way
to the post office in the village...
and he ran straight into a jeep
and sprained his neck.
Strained his neck?
That's not funny.
He permanently sprained his neck.
Since then, it's been extremely painful
for him to tuck the violin...
Crashes into a jeep
and totals his neck.
I have to tell you.
Daddy's very ill.
- What?
- He's had two strokes.
He's not...
They feel, maybe,
he might not recover from it.
Don't tell me about this.
But don't you think it's right
that you should see him at least once?
- <i>Miss Dupea.</i>
- Just a minute, please.
Don't you think it's right
you should see him?
Yeah, I guess so.
I'm going back up tonight.
Will you come with me?
I'd rather drive up.
Maybe I'll go
into Canada after.
I'm not gonna stay long.
One week at the most.
I know.
Well...
Come on.
I'll walk you out.
I'll be back
in two minutes.
<i>We've had our break, Miss Dupea.</i>
- They hate me, I feel.
- Maybe you better stay.
I want to talk to you
about so many things.
I'll be seeing you
in a couple of days.
I'm so glad.
Me too.
Bye.
Hello?
You got the day off?
Are you sick?
Guess you heard
about Elton.
Okay, I got your point.
I hope you didn't strain yourself...
getting in here
before I hit the back door.
I have to go home.
My father's sick.
I'll be gone
for two or three weeks.
You'll be gone period.
I'll try and call you
from up there.
Come on, Dipesto.
I never told you
it would work out to anything.
Did I?
I'll send you some money.
That's all I can do.
I'll try and call you
from up there.
Bye, Ray.
You wanna go with me?
<i>There's been hot spells</i>
<i>and cold spells ever since we've met</i>
<i>I've seen your big fires</i>
<i>your small fires</i>
<i>But I won't give up yet</i>
<i>Oh, someday you'll yearn</i>
<i>'Cause your heart's gonna burn</i>
<i>For that old familiar glow</i>
<i>You'll be first</i>
- Like it?
- I love it.
<i>You'll be burned out</i>
<i>or smoked out</i>
<i>And come back to me</i>
<i>I know</i>
- What the hell are they doing?
- Is that an accident?
Who was driving?
You were driving!
What's going on?
Rotate, mack!
Look at my car.
I just bought it brand-new from a used
car lot, and the steering goes to pot.
- You're lucky nobody was hurt.
- Can you give us a lift?
Come on, Terry!
We got a ride!
You're gonna give those people
a lift?
- I can't just leave them here.
- I'd like to punch that son of a bitch.
Jesus. What a rude person.
- What's your name?
- Palm Apodaca.
- What's your name?
- Terry Grouse.
What?
How far are you going?
Washington.
We'll get off in Washington.
We'll hook a ride.
- Where are you going?
- Alaska.
Alaska?
What, are you on vacation?
She wants to live there
because it's cleaner.
Cleaner?
Cleaner than what?
You don't have to tell everybody.
Soon, they'll all go,
and it won't be so clean.
What makes you think it's cleaner?
I saw a picture of it.
Alaska's very clean.
It appeared to look
very white to me.
Don't you think?
Yep. That was before
the big thaw.
Before the what?
I had to leave this place because
I got depressed seeing all the crap.
The thing is,
they're making more crap.
They got so many stores
and stuff and junk full of crap.
- I can't believe it.
- Who?
Who?
Man, that's who.
Pretty soon, there won't be
any room for man.
They're selling more crap that
people buy than you can imagine.
Crap.
I believe everybody should have
a big hole...
where they throw the stuff in
and burn it.
They'd never find a hole
big enough. Never.
Take me. Look at me.
When I was just one person,
before I was with Bobby...
I was collecting onto me more garbage
every day...
till I was gettin' to thinkin'
that I should get a disposal.
Disposal?
What's that, but more crap?
I've never seen such crap.
- Mass production is what does it.
- Mass? You're not that clean either.
Wait. I'm not that neat,
but I am clean.
You're not that bad.
But some people.
People's homes, just filth.
I've been in people's homes...
In my personal observation,
more people are neat than clean.
I don't see that.
I'm seeing more filth.
A lot of filth.
What they need to do every day,
no, once in a while...
is do a cockroach thing
where they spray the homes.
Imagine if their doors
were painted a pretty color...
and they had a pot outside.
- Yeah, could be adorable.
- And they picked up.
Then it wouldn't be filthy
with Coke bottles and whiskey and...
those signs everywhere,
they should be erased!
All those signs selling you crap
and more crap and more crap.
I don't know.
I don't even want to talk about it.
- Well...
- It's just filthy. People are filthy.
I think that's the biggest thing
that's wrong with people.
They'd be less violent
if they were clean...
because then they wouldn't have
anybody to pick on.
Dirt.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad.
It's filth. Filth is bad.
That's what starts maggots
and riots.
Follow that truck.
They know the best places to stop.
- That's an old maid's tale.
- Bullshit.
Only truck drivers know
the best places to stop.
Salesman and cops are.
If you'd ever waitressed, honey,
you'd know.
- Don't call me honey, mack.
- Don't call me mack, honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress.
They're nasty and full of crap.
You just hold on to your tongue.
Hold on to this.
If you think you can talk to me
like that...
Shut up, all of ya!
I'd like a plain omelet.
No potatoes.
Tomatoes instead.
A cup of coffee
and wheat toast.
No substitutions.
What do you mean?
You don't have any tomatoes?
Only what's on the menu. You can have
number two, a plain omelet.
It comes with fries and rolls.
I know, but it's not
what I want.
- Make up your mind.
- Wait.
I have made up my mind.
I'd like a plain omelet.
No potatoes on the plate.
A cup of coffee and a side order
of wheat toast.
I'm sorry, we don't have
any side orders of toast.
I'll give you an English muffin
or a coffee roll.
No side orders of toast?
You make sandwiches, don't you?
Would you like to talk
to the manager?
- Hey, mack.
- Shut up.
You've got bread
and a toaster of some kind?
I don't make the rules.
I'll make it
as easy for you as I can.
I'd like a plain omelet and
a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast.
No mayonnaise, no butter, no lettuce,
and a cup of coffee.
A number two.
A chicken sal san.
Hold the butter, the lettuce
and the mayonnaise.
And a cup of coffee.
Anything else?
Yeah, now all you have to do is
hold the chicken, bring me the toast...
give me a check
for a chicken salad sandwich...
and you haven't broken
any rules.
You want me
to hold the chicken, huh?
I want you to hold it
between your knees.
See that sign?
Yes, you all have to leave.
I'm not taking any more
of your smartness and sarcasm.
You see this sign?
Fantastic that you could
figure that out...
so that you could come up
with a way to get your toast.
Yeah? Well,
I didn't get it, did I?
No, but it was very clever.
I would've just punched her out.
People.
Animals are not like that.
They're always cleaning themselves.
Did you ever see pigeons?
He's always picking on himself
and his friends.
They're always picking bugs
out of their hair.
Monkeys too.
Except they do something
out in the open that I don't go for.
I read where they invented
this car that runs on...
When you boil water?
Steam.
Right. A car you could ride in
and not cause a stink.
Do you know they will not
even let us have it?
Can you believe it?
Why? Man!
He likes to create a stink.
I've seen filth
that you wouldn't believe.
What a stink.
I don't even wanna talk about it.
You depressed
about your daddy, hon?
I imagine it's me, then.
Isn't it?
Is what you?
Are you depressed
I come along?
Who says I'm depressed?
Is that a happy face I see?
'Cause if it is, I'll just
catch a Greyhound back.
You're not gonna kill yourself
this time. I wish I'd known.
Well...
I don't know if I'm going
to be able to get to sleep.
Hint, hint.
Guess I'll have to count
the sheep.
One, two...
three, four...
five, six...
seven...
Look at this old cold shoulder.
What am I going to do about it?
If you wouldn't open your mouth,
everything would be just fine.
Tick a lock.
Why can't I go to your family's house?
Give me one good reason.
I have to see
what's going on first.
My father's sick.
You understand?
They wouldn't be prepared
for my bringing anyone.
How long do I have to twiddle
my thumbs here?
Look, if you can't do
what I'm asking you...
why don't you just take the money
and go back south with it?
Honey, don't talk like that.
Would you try and understand?
This is not something that I want to do.
Jesus Christ. You ought to know me
well enough for that.
All right.
It'll be all right.
There's stuff for me to do.
They've got magazines in there,
and the TV, right?
Yeah.
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.
All right.
Bye.
He doesn't even know
who the hell I am.
- How long...
- Remember Mother used to...
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
Go ahead. Excuse me.
I wanted to ask Robert
how long he's been away from here.
Three years.
No, it's more like two years,
isn't it, hmm?
It's been more than that, Carl.
Tita, you have no sense of timing
away from the piano.
I don't think that's true.
It's true.
What have you been doing
since then?
Odd jobs of work here and there.
Nothing too interesting.
You no longer play at all?
You know, before my misfortune...
I'm not sure
you're aware of my accident.
Yeah. Tita was telling me
about it.
It's very difficult for me
to turn my neck, this way especially.
If I want to look at Catherine,
I have to shift my whole body around.
I was real sorry
to hear about it, Carl.
I said, I was real sorry
to hear about it.
Anyway, as I was saying...
Catherine, what was I saying, hmm?
You were saying something
about something...
that happened around the time
of the accident.
Oh, yes!
Just before the accident.
After I'd come off tour
with the Betanthaller Quartet...
Father and Herbert and I
had a summit conference concerning you.
A summit conference? Where was I,
polishing silver behind the coal bin?
I don't know where you were,
penis envy.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Nevertheless...
they wanted to hire a detective
to ferret you out.
I talked them out of it because I felt
that whatever you were doing...
you had a perfect right to do
no matter how...
nonsensical your adventures
might be.
- It was as simple as that.
- I really appreciate it.
I don't think you ought to imply
Daddy was wrong in front of Daddy.
Don't force him that way, Spicer.
How long have you been here?
Oh, only two months.
Well, satiety is
my father and mother.
Carl?
If you're finished,
I think I'd like to go do some work.
Certainly, dear.
Excuse me.
See you later.
I hope you feel
right at home, Robert.
I feel fine.
He has ways
of communicating, Robert.
I can tell when he's expressing approval
or disapproval, just from his eyes.
Yeah. Some range.
I can't take much more of seeing him
sitting there like a stone.
It's not that bad.
Yes, it is.
Will you stay a while?
I don't know.
Breathe.
All right.
Now, once more.
- Hello.
- Hi.
I've been looking all over for you.
- You have? I went riding.
- Riding?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's dangerous, you know.
Riding?
You play the piano all day, then jump
on a horse, you could get cramps.
Well, I like to ride.
Rain or shine, I do it
any chance I can get.
- It's very invigorating.
- Is it?
Yes.
I don't like to get
too invigorated myself.
You don't?
What else do you do?
Well, there's fishing, boating.
There's concerts on the mainland.
I feel silly telling you.
This is really your home.
You know better than I
what there is to do.
Nothing.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
It must be very boring
for you here.
That's right.
I find that hard to comprehend.
I don't think
I've ever been bored. Excuse me.
What are you doing right now?
Right now I plan to take
a hot tub and soak myself.
Then after that?
After that I plan to read some music
and rest for a while.
Tomorrow then?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow's a full practice day.
But the day after tomorrow,
I will be free.
Carl has hydrotherapy
on Tuesdays.
- The day after tomorrow?
- Will you be free?
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
One thing I find
very difficult to imagine...
is how one could have
this incredible background in music...
and then just walk away from it
without giving it a second thought.
I gave it a second thought.
How could you no longer play at all?
I think that's very strange.
I played a little bit
here and there.
As a matter of fact,
once I was a rehearsal pianist.
For ballet, an opera?
Las Vegas musical revue.
- You don't call that music.
- Oh, yes, I do.
It's music, you know.
<i>Bring on the girls</i>
<i>I'm singing you a song</i>
<i>And off with the hey...</i>
More gingerbread?
No, thank you.
Applesauce?
You know what I suggest, Ray.
Yeah, that's what I suggest...
because I don't know
how long it's gonna be.
I have to go now.
I have to get off now, Ray.
Yeah, well, uh...
I'll try and call you
in a couple of days.
If you're gone, you're gone.
Bye.
Robert, shh. My playing
put Father to sleep.
Would you help me
with this, please?
That's it.
You sure you should
be playing, Carl?
What do you mean?
I'm in superb shape, except for my neck.
There's something funny
about the way you move.
I'm not aware of...
What do you mean?
Two, eighteen.
I'd hate to see you walk
across a concert stage like that.
Two, nineteen.
I'd get somebody to coach you
on how to walk, if I was you, Carl.
I think
it's a substantial problem.
Damn it.
Look at that.
- Why are you being so mean?
- Mean? I'm not being mean.
He does walk funny.
Don't you see that?
He's walking around...
I don't think I'd notice.
I'm so used to Carl.
Yeah, well...
Do you think Spicer is attractive?
I think he's got
a terrific personality.
Spicer was formerly a sailor.
Look. Don't you see that?
Look at that. The guy's...
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
You see? There's nothing wrong with
my walk, hmm? Where were we?
At game, Carl.
Well, that's three games
to "Z," Carl.
How about a rematch?
I thought you were going to the mainland
today. You'll miss the ferry.
Just when I was hitting my stride.
Say good-bye to Catherine
for me, will you?
Can I play now?
Tell her I'll be back
sometime tomorrow, will you?
Where is she, anyway?
Who?
Shopping in the village.
My turn.
Why don't you and Spicer play?
Hi.
Hello.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Would you do something for me?
Would you play for me?
Catherine, your game.
Will you?
That was beautiful.
I'm surprised.
Thank you.
I was really very moved by...
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's just...
I picked the easiest piece
that I could think of.
I first played it when I was eight,
and I played it better then.
Can't you understand it was the feeling
I was affected by?
I didn't have any.
- You had no inner feeling?
- None.
Well, then, I must have been
supplying it.
Maybe if you'd supply more, it might
rub off on me. Who knows?
I doubt it.
I could get interested.
Well, I couldn't.
What does it have to be with you?
Grim and serious?
Look, you played.
I honestly responded...
and you made me feel embarrassed
for having responded to you.
It wasn't necessary.
Yeah, it was.
I faked a little Chopin.
You faked a big response.
I don't think that's accurate.
Up till now,
All I've been getting from you...
is meaningful looks
at the dinner table...
and a lot of vague suggestions
about the day after tomorrow.
I am not conscious of having given you
any particular looks.
And as for the day after tomorrow,
this is the day after tomorrow...
and I am, unfortunately,
seeing you.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd like to take a bath.
- What do you want?
- I need some bath oil.
Bath oil? How about some avocado
or some of this?
- Or some jasmine? How about this?
- What are you doing?
What are you doing,
screwing around with all this crap?
I do not find your language
very charming.
It isn't. It's direct.
I'd like you to leave
so that I can take a bath.
Is that direct?
Serious...
- Is that what's important to you?
- Yes, that's what's important to me.
- Let's be serious.
- Don't do that.
Shut up.
No inner feeling?
I told him the truth finally.
He was my husband,
and I loved him very much.
But my God, it wasn't working
any better the second time...
than it did the first.
He was a cellist...
and there was I,
no longer 17...
looking up at him,
and I said to him...
"Joseph, you're full of beans."
And I left him.
- Is that what you said to him?
- Something like that.
As a matter of fact, Joseph
introduced me to Carl right around then.
How are you?
I'm incredible.
Carl restored me.
He really did.
He's much more substantial
than you give him credit for being.
Do you think you could
discreetly move across the hall now?
Yes, I think I could
discreetly move across the hall now.
I have some free time tomorrow morning
before Carl gets back, if you'd like.
Of course I'd like it.
Bananas, bananas.
You certainly do have a beautiful piece
of real estate out here, Mr. Dupea.
Can he hear me?
He's not hard of hearing.
Oh, that's a blessing at least.
This certainly is an improvement
on the motel and coffee shop.
How could you ever have left
such a beautiful place, Bobby?
I don't know.
You mean you've been staying
in a motel all this time?
For two whole weeks, and there was
hardly nobody to talk to but me.
But I don't understand? Why did you stay
there? There's plenty of room here.
I was going to, but...
Bobby had to come up here, he said,
and feel it up here first.
But then it took so long...
I run flat out of money.
You didn't leave me any number
or anything, honey.
And I had to, you know,
get in a taxi...
and come on out here...
in the hopes that I would not be
intrudin' myself.
No, not at all. You're perfectly
welcome to stay here.
Well, thank you.
That's a very nice thing
for you to say.
Not at all.
You certainly do have
a beautiful head of hair.
Thank you.
Is it natural?
What?
Just finish eating.
Am I holdin' up dessert?
No, not at all.
Take all the time you want.
I do eat slow as a bird...
whereas Bobby can pack it away
like a speed swing.
- Is there any ketchup around?
- For God's sake.
Robert, please,
let's not be rude.
It's okay. He didn't
mean anything by that.
I don't, huh?
Bobby's just about...
the moodiest man
I've ever been with.
- Are you all right?
- Where are you going?
To pick up some friends
of Carl's and mine.
- I wanna talk to you.
- I'll be back later.
I want to talk to you right now.
I want to explain.
- No, it isn't necessary.
- Yes, it is.
Come on, get moving!
- Will you shut up!
- Robert, I have to go.
Will you just wait one minute?
I haven't been fair to Carl.
I have to tell you that.
What? I can't hear you.
I'm sorry everything's
been so confusing.
I'll see you later
this evening.
But you see, man is born
into the world...
with his existent adversary
from the first.
It is his historic,
mythic inheritance.
So, is this startling?
Aggression is prehistoric. An organism
behaves according to its nature...
and its nature derives from
the circumstances of its inheritance.
The fact remains that primitive man took
delight in tearing his adversary apart.
And there is where, I think,
the core of the problem resides.
Doesn't that seem
unnecessarily apocalyptic?
I do not make poetry.
Is there a TV in the house?
I remarked to John...
that rationality is not a device
to alter facts.
But moreover, I think of it
as an extraneous tool, a gadget...
somewhat like the television.
To look at it any other way
is ridiculous.
There's some good things
on it, though.
- I beg your pardon.
- The TV.
There's some good things on it
sometimes.
I have strong doubts. Nevertheless,
I am not discussing media.
And there is always hope
for the few.
- What about love?
- What about it?
Wouldn't you say that more ill
has been done in the name of love...
than in the name of abomination?
No, I wouldn't.
Well, you are a romantic,
Catherine...
and once more,
about to be married.
So you can be excused from
objective discussions. But ask Carl.
Ask him if even the institution
of marriage is completely free from it.
Ask him.
I think these cold, objective
discussions are aggressive.
- Excuse me.
- That's reactive.
But if I may say without dampening
the spirit of your adventure...
You haven't dampened
my spirit, Samia.
- Excuse me.
- Well, I should hope not.
- But it's still open to discussion.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry,
I don't speak French.
And loftier natures...
- What kind of dog is this?
- This is a border collie.
I had a baby kitty cat once.
It was a fluffy thing.
Bobby gave it to me. Remember, Bobby?
- The little pussy cat you gave me?
- Yeah.
It had two little white front paws...
and I was crazy after her.
We left her at some friends' house...
and she got squashed flatter than
a tortilla outside their mobile home.
There. Do you see
what I mean?
The choice of words juxtaposed
with the image of a fluffy kitten.
The enchantment of words
"squashed," "flat," et cetera.
- Et cetera.
- Well, she was.
Perhaps, but it was just
what I was trying to point out.
Don't point at her.
I beg your pardon.
- I said, don't point at her, you creep.
- But I was just...
Where do you get the ass
to tell anybody anything about class...
or who's got it
or what she typifies?
You shouldn't be in the same room
with her, you pompous celibate.
- This is too much.
- Just calm down.
You're totally full of shit.
You're all full of shit.
I can't talk to you.
Leave me alone.
- What the hell's going on?
- What are you doing?
Get out of my room.
This is my room.
I'm talking to you, Tita! I told you
to take your hands off her, nurse!
- Move out!
- Stop it!
Will ya... Hold it!
Take it easy.
- Take it easy, will ya?
- Please, stop!
- Will you give up? Give up, will ya?
- Stop it!
Give up!
I just wanted to talk to you.
It's useless.
Look, give me a chance.
I'm trying to be delicate
with you...
but you just won't understand.
I couldn't go with you.
Not because of Carl and my music,
but because of you.
You're a strange person, Robert.
What will you come to?
If a person has no love for himself,
no respect for himself...
no love of his friends,
family, work, something...
how can he ask for love in return?
Why should he ask for it?
Living here in this rest home, asylum...
that's what you want?
Yes.
That will make you happy?
I hope it will. Yes.
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Are you cold?
I don't know if you'd be...
particularly interested
in hearing anything about me...
my life.
Most of it doesn't add up
to much that I could relay...
as a way of life
that you'd approve of.
I move around a lot.
Not because I'm looking
for anything really, but...
'cause I'm getting away
from things that get bad...
if I stay.
Auspicious beginnings.
You know what I mean?
I'm trying to imagine your...
your half of this conversation.
My feeling is,
I don't know...
that if you could talk,
we wouldn't be talking.
It's pretty much the way
that it got to be before I left.
Are you all right?
I don't know what to say.
Tita suggested that we try to...
I don't know.
I think that she feels...
I think that she feels that we've got
some understanding to reach.
She totally denies the fact
that we were never that comfortable...
with one another to begin with.
The best
that I can do is apologize.
We both know that I was never
that good at it anyway.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.
I said a week.
I think I overstayed myself.
You were going without
saying good-bye to me.
I didn't want to say good-bye
to anyone.
What about me?
I'll say good-bye to you, Tita.
Watch the birdie!
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Come on.
- Wait a sec.
I want Tita to take a picture
of you and me in front of the place.
I never got to thank you all
for your hospitality.
Tell Carl, if any of you want to come
to our place, you're more than welcome.
Bye, now.
<i>Your kiss is like a drink</i>
<i>When I am thirsty</i>
<i>Oh, and I'm thirsty</i>
<i>For you</i>
<i>With all my heart</i>
<i>But don't love me</i>
<i>then pretend</i>
<i>As though</i>
<i>we've never even kissed</i>
<i>Don't touch me</i>
Cut it out!
Son of a bitch, Bobby!
You quit pushing me away like that.
I've had enough of that
to last me an entire lifetime.
Why don't you just be good to me
for a change?
There isn't anybody gonna look after you
and love you as good as I do.
Did you hear me?
Baby?
I'm going in that cafe
for some coffee.
You want anything?
You got any change?
You don't have any change?
Sure you don't want anything?
Fill it up, will ya?
Hey, wait!
Don't you got a jacket
or anything with you?
It got burned up.
Everything in the car
got the shit burned out of it.
Everything.
All I've got is what I've got on.
I got one behind the seat.
If you want it, put it on.
No, it's okay.
Suit yourself.
I'll tell you one thing.
Where we're going,
it's gonna get colder than hell.
No, that's okay.
I'm fine.
