Greetings from Tromaville.
Let me take you back, back
to where it all began...
to a small town in New Jersey.
At that time, the Tromaville
nuclear power plant
had a horrifying meltdown,
tainting the water supply
of Tromaville High School,
which was carelessly
located right next door.
Heinous mutations occurred,
transforming the student body
into radiated creatures
and cretins.
Well, not every
student turned evil.
Our heroes Warren and
Chrissy saved the day
by blowing up the nuclear power
plant and the school therein,
eliminating evil and setting
things back to normal.
Oh, and some other
stuff also happened.
But today, since
criticizing nuclear power
is no longer in vogue,
at least in movies,
the Tromaville nuclear power
plant has been bulldozed
to make way for the
environmentally friendly,
health-conscious Tromorganic
Foodstuffs Inc,
built directly on top of
the old nuclear plant.
What could go wrong?
This is no typical remake.
I want you to join me
as we "Return to Nuke 'Em High"!
Oh, by the way, excelsior!

Now look, laddie, I want
my ultracheap foodstuffs
in every school in New
Jersey at inflated prices.
That is the basis of our
plan, and you know it.
No fast-food place will
take my food anymore.
Hmm?
God damn it!
Now you... you, Westly, as principal
of the guinea pig charter school...
- Sir, the president's on the line!
- Give me that.
Oh! Why do you do that?
Yes, Mr. President.
- Disconnected.
- I'll get him back!
Now what is all this about a rogue
student blog, Pollution Nerdz,
talking about my foodstuffs
contaminating the groundwater
and poisoning the students?
It's slanderous.
And it may be true.
If word got out, we'd be ruined.
I got him back!
I'm going to... give me
that. Give me that.
Yes, Mr. President.
Oh, everything is just going
beautifully... beautifully.
Look, there's...
there's always gonna...
There's always gonna be a Zuckerberg
in every school. Everything's fine.
Yes. And I'll see you in Havana.
Yeah, I'll get the hookers.
Don't bring Michelle.
- Something wrong, boss?
- Everything is fine.
You just pay attention to that
slogan the spinmasters gave us:
"Propagation is health."
"Propagation is health."
And make sure... make sure those
students at Tromaville High School
are loving it! Are loving it!
- Oh, man.
- What do you want?
This Plasti taco mix foodstuff
don't look right, boss.
Well, you want to go
green, don't you?
It looks green to me.
Get over here, you bastard.
Give me my milk.
Give me that. Give me that.
Ah!

Oh, yeah.

Uh, Eugene.
Eugene.
Uh, Eugene.
Eugene. Eugene!
What is it?
Uh, it's that time of the month
and it's a horror movie
down there, so...
Again?
That's what you said last week.
You know, I have toxic shock
syndrome from all the tampons.
And I got a headache, so...
Look, Chrissy,
I think you're super sexy
in a butch kind of way,
which is weird, because what
does that say about me?
But we've been talking about
having sweet, sweaty,
dirty, kinky, really weird,
fucked-up teenage sex
in my big, blue,
white-cream-leather-seat
El Dorado for months now
and this is all I get?
You have to be kidding me!
At least you broads
won't let me down.
Oh, I really need to get
another subscription.
Argh! Oh, you're missing out.
You're really missing out.
You have no idea.
Argh!
Look out, Tromaville High.
Here comes the new girl.
Oh.
Hey, new girl, look
at these titties.
They're bigger than yours.
You want to go to the prom with me?
Where you going?
What's her deal?
I don't know, but she is hot.
She's a rich bitch.
How the fuck would you
know, micro phallus?
Attention, students.
Please empty all items
into the plastic tray
before passing through
the metal detector.
We've gone three days
without a shooting.
Let's keep it up.
Come on.
She lives in Tromaville Heights.
My dad sold her family
their McMansion,
kind of like the one you live in,
Marilyn McManson.
You twat.
Thank God for Zoloft
and thrift stores.
Would you pull this, please?
Please, please, please,
let go, let go, let go.
Come on, guys, let's go.
Oh.
The pope retired.
Fuck you.
Oh.
I am so sorry. I really didn't...
A brownnosing little rich girl
late for intramural Ping-Pong?
Ping-Pong is on Wednesdays.
Today is Monday.
I am right about one thing,
though, Miley Cyrus:
you are a brownnosing
little rich girl.
Looks like Mommy and Daddy
won't be able to save you
from a beating this time.
You know what? Some of us actually
have plans for our future
that don't involve binge drinking,
trailer parks or food stamps.
Ow! Fuck!
I'm gonna get you, rich girl.
Ow.
Kevin, I'm home!
I love you, Kevin.
I know you'll never leave me.
It's great being rich and
having a duck as a pet.
Okay, time to check my blog
and see how many
eyes I've opened up
with my investigation
of Tromorganic Farms.
OMG!
18 whole page views.
18 people have checked in.
What a month. I'll
need more bandwidth.
Here are some exclusive photos
from member
Deeper Throat.
Not only does Tromorganics
secretly mix in
what appears to be
sweetened wallpaper paste,
but the contaminated
groundwater is everywhere.
The contaminated...
contamination...
um...
Cyber malaise.
Tiredness.
Horniness.
Where is that one site
with that chick that looks
like Angelina Jolie in "Gia"?
Jackpot.

I'm just feeling a little...
Sad about being an orphan?
Now that you mention it.
No, that's not it.
I bet I know what it is.
- You do?
- Well, of course I do.
Don't worry, honey. Someday
you'll find the right boy.
The right boy, yeah.
And don't you worry, he
won't be some deadbeat
goat sucker like your
stinking father, that twat.
What's that?
Looks like
foreshadowing?
Dinner's at 7:00. It's tuna.

Attention, students.
Now I know you're all
looking forward to today's luncheon
Super Duper Taco
Tuesday Spectacular,
but it's come to my attention
that there's a blogger out there
by the name of Lettuce Lover 69
and they run the blog
called Pollution Nerdz.
I have checked in on this
Pollution Nerdz blog
18 times this month.
Now this blog is spreading
a lot of slanderous lies
about Tromaville High and
Tromorganic Foodstuffs Inc.
They also have a very bad attitude
towards conservative
principles in general.
Leave Ronald Reagan alone.
Now I'm all for free speech.
Otherwise why would I put out
these thought-inhibiting
announcements every morning?
But these lies about
contaminated, cheap
and 98% Plasti filler tainted
foodstuffs are just malarkey.
Have you seen my duck?
His name is Kevin.
Oh.
Have you seen my missing duck?
Can a duck fill you up like Jesus?
What kind of god allows an
innocent duck to go missing?
Hey, there's that snotty rich girl.
I think she really likes me.
- Hey, Twinkie.
- Hey!
Ah!
What a rich, stuck-up bitch.
Why won't anyone go out with me?
Yo, did you hear Principal
Westly's announcement?
Are you gonna take
down Pollution Nerdz?
Yo, Jeraldo!
Caw-caw! Caw-caw!
Uh, would Gertrude Stein
take down her blog?
Hell, no. So I stay full steam
ahead with Pollution Nerdz
and let's sally forth.
Gertrude Stein was a
rich slacker bullshitter
and her so-called poetry stunk.
And please don't even go
there with Sally Forth...
another sexually repressed
white American soccer mom
who had boring adventures at work
and at home with no vibrator.
You deserve your own PBS special.
- You know what you deserve?
- What's that, Henry Gates?
Two feet shoved up your fucking...
Guys, my mom made me a
juicy roast beef sammich
with dipping sauce...
dipping sauce.
You heard what he said,
guys... dipping sauce.
You know what that means, right?
Yeah, and I can feel my blood
sugar dipping right now.
- I want to eat it.
- Let's go.
It's cheaper than monkey shit,
and these kids can't get
enough of it in their gullet.
Hey, what's that green stuff
in the gluten-free tacos
for Terrance, the glee club,
and the other nerds?
Oh, that? That's just
nonchemically polluted guacamole.
Wait, why did you mention they
were nonchemically polluted?
Uh, no reason.
Eh, whatever. I'm hungry.
Hey, Terrance!
How's that green, gluten-free,
nonchemically polluted taco?

Hi, guys.
Mind if I sit here?
No.
Oh, my God.
Hi. I'm Lauren.
Don't worry, it's just
another school shooting.
CNN won't even cover them anymore.
You can chill.
Wow, rich girl ain't
fucking around.
Where did you get your
lunch box... Tiffany's?
Hey, you guys.
I heard about this sick party/rave
in one of Tromaville's
356 foreclosed houses.
You all should come.
That sick party/rave
happens to be happening
in my foreclosed house,
thank you very much.
But it's only a small gathering,
so please keep it on the down low.
Gross.
Guys, guys, what with exams
coming up and whatnot,
a blowout party/rave
is just what Eugene needs!
Great.
I'm so happy for Eugene, who refers
to himself in the third person
and will finally be able to blow
off some steam at my expense.
I actually heard on NPR
that the stress of studying for exams
and getting into a good college
is actually worse than the stress
our soldiers face in Afghanistan.
The next time your car
gets blown up by an IED
or you're forced to bag the bodies of
children killed by a suicide bomber,
you tell me if that stress is
greater than getting into Hobart.
Oh!
Wow, Slater, you have family
members in Afghanistan?
No.
But I did illegally download
"The Hurt Locker"
and got sued by the filmmakers.
You see, Lauren, now that's stress.
Look at this bitch
and her Jap food.
Miso soup, me so hungry.
Get away from me, you bully.
I am so,
so sorry.
Fight, fight, fight, fight!
What are you doing?
Punch her uterus!
Stop! That's enough.
You are both going to
detention after school today.
That's it. Get out.
- I'm gonna get you, rich girl.
- Shut it!
Get up.
Uh, Lauren, hi.
Uh, my name is Zac.
- Let me help you with that.
- No, I got it.
I just... I was wondering
if sometime maybe you
would want to come over
and we could watch Joel
Schumacher's "Batman and Robin."
Or maybe you're more of
a "Transformers" girl.
They're more than meets the eye.
As long as it's not one of those
god-awful "Star Wars"
prequels, we're all good.
Zac, that's really nice
and everything, but...
- It's 'cause I'm fat, right?
- No.
- A lard-ass, right?
- No.
To you, I'm just a jelly
roll, jizz dwarf,
snatch badger, ass troll
who eats donuts and cakes
and Twinkies and pies
with his fat, fat, fatty-fat
piehole, right?
What?
What do all those words even mean?
Or maybe... maybe you don't
even like boys at all.
No.
No, it's because you
smell like roast beef.
Shh. Shh. Shh.
Shh, shh. It's okay. It's okay.
Guys, guys, guys.
We like that smell, right?
- Roast beef?
- No, he smells like shit.
You shouldn't have said
"Batman and Robin," man.
It's "Batman Forever."
"Batman Forever," baby.
Help.
Help.
Whoa.
Goddamn diabetic kids.
You're out of your mind.
I love Justin Bieber.
Justin Bieber is the best.
Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!
Come on, guys. This is
awesome. Come on.
What in the name of
Christ is going on here?
Look, I love Justin Bieber.
No! Why?
OMG, this picture
will totally get me
at least six more
forwards on Instagram.
This is so going on my blog.
I'm just waiting for
Myspace to come back.
Stop, everyone!
Step back, come on.
This is a horrible accident.
Step back now. Step back.
Give him his dignity.
Is there a doctor in the house?
Scratch that. Is there a
janitor in the house?
Now it's a well-known fact
that this student was a
smoker of the marijuana.
And I'm willing to bet that
his dental records will prove
he was a drama student.
And the smoking of ganja
has been known to cause
cranial explosions
and this type of thing in
overly dramatic students.
What? Wait, wait.
Actually, I've just been informed
that we've all witnessed here
is in fact a drama
department's latest venture.
It's a remake of Arthur Miller's
classic "Death of a Salesman"
as imagined by Christopher Nolan.
So nothing to see here.
Everyone back to class.
Hey, watch it.
Why are you bullying me?
What have I ever done to you?
Bullying? You think I'm a bully?
You want to know why?
Because people like
you have it so easy.
Poor little rich girl never
had to work a day in her life
while I can barely afford lunch.
It makes me sick. So fuck you.
Why don't you stick your silver
chopstick up your bento box?
You don't know me.
And I don't own any
silver chopsticks.
What's with the skinless Furbies?
I like babies.
I want to have a lot
of them one day.
Only fame-whore teen moms
who want to be on MTV,
rich kids and drooling
idiots want to have babies.
That's it, Chrissy Goldberg.
To the principal's office, now.
But Westly said if I show up one more
time this year, he'll suspend me.
Wait, Miss Bliss, it was me.
I was the one who was talking.
I'm new here and I don't know
too many people, so I just...
Well, all right. Just
sit down and shut up.
Okay.
No more talking.
That was stupid, rich girl.
The new girl has beautiful hair.
What did you say?
Uh, I said old Westly looks
like a fat-ass bear.
Your jokes make me so hot.
We should totally bang tonight.
Taco Tuesday was a huge success.
But, unfortunately, we also
suffered a horrible tragedy.
We all loved and respected little
Timmy... Tommy... Terrance
Horowitz, I don't know.
But like Mama Cass
from The Mamas and the Papas
who choked to death
on a ham sandwich,
this unfortunate kid,
whatever his name was,
suffered the same accidental fate.
Now I can't stress enough the
word "accidental" there.
No! 'Twas those
terrible Tuesday Tacos
that tragically
transformed Terrance.
Nice alliteration, yo.
Don't you people see?
It was the food!
Get him out. Get him out.
- Security. Out.
- No.
- No. No.
- Get him out of here.
No!
No. No!
"The Class of Nuke 'Em High"
was an inside job!
You've got the wrong
person, you blind bozo.
Now I would like to
further eulogize
our decapitated
comrade in education
by having our lovely glee
club come out to sing a song.
You know, Patrick, the glee club
isn't as gay as it used to be,
thanks to the Fox Network.
Head explod...
head exploding is a
serious problem, y'all.
And we're here to talk about it.

Yo, yo, yo, my niggas,
my jiggas, my wiggas,
Eugene the Machine has arrived
and he feels alive!
Now y'all give him five!
That's it? Nothing?
Not even an impromptu dance number?
Eugene needs a drink.
I used to smoke after sex.
Now I broccoli.
So what do we do now?
Come out of the closet like Ellen?
I think we should.
You can't even wear a hoodie
and eat Skittles in this town
without getting shot.
A hoodie? Are you saying being
gay is worse than being black?
No, I'm saying that in this town
people think that LGBT stands for
"lynch, grope, bully, torture."
I'll stick with the closet, thanks.
Whoa, Eugene likes it rough.
Eugene needs some.
Yeah? You want to see this?
Whoa.
I'm gonna show 'em to you, baby.
I'm gonna show you
everything I got.
Baby, Eugene needs to see.
Oh. Oh-ho-ho.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, baby, it's been a long time.
You've got no idea.
Oh, snap.
Eugene can't wait. Eugene
ain't got more patience.
Eugene needs to feel this now.
- Yeah? Are you gonna touch it?
- Yeah, I'm gonna touch it.
I'm gonna touch it.
I'm gonna touch it.
What you got? Oh, man.
Oh, man. Oh, man!
You really are a man!
A Party. and we were not invited.
Donatello, let's give them a shot.
Yup.
Eugene is confused.
Malfunction. Malfunction.
Machine shutdown.
Let's get out of here.
But I'm also saying
that I've never felt
this way before.
Me either.
It's the love that dare
not speak its name.
- This is hot.
- Yeah, this is so hot.
No, like really hot.
Like, I'm burning up.
Wait, do you smell smoke?
- Fire!
- Fire!

Look at these jerks.
They call themselves Cretins.
They look more like
Glee-tins to me.
Donatello, burn some rubber!
Motherfuckers!
Give me the duck.
You wouldn't hit a
cripple, would you?
Yeah, I would.
Hey, we was just kiddin'.
Duck rape is life-affirming.
It was on NPR.
Oh, well, this ain't
about duck rape.
It's about dick rape.
No! No!
- Whoa!
- Oh, shit.
Mother's body began to change too.
Time for the baby

Something's about to burst,

What the...?

Look at those cholesterol levels.

My dick is hungry.
Mm-hmm.
Please don't hurt us.
Wait, we're not with them.
We're just... we're just extras.
Yeah, that... that's it.

I'm so pissed.
I need revenge. I need
an outlet for my anger.
Oh, snap. Maybe we
need some new blood.
Yes, but who?
Excuse me. Hi. I have baked goods.
Hey. guys. what's the haps?
Hi. I want to join your gang.
You think you got what
it takes, lard-ass?
I just want to belong.
Oh-ho.
Why don't you go get revenge
on your two bitch-ass friends?
And then we can see what we can do.
Lauren and Chrissy?
Yeah, dipshit. Got it?
Go. Go, go, go.
- Oh, snap.
- Go.
That's why they call me Cigar Face.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
no laughing. No laughing.
Now listen very carefully...
very carefully.
Some of our innocent young
glee club members
from the high school
have been savagely,
savagely murdered.
And I'm hearing that the
culprits are two women...
- Hmm?
- ...one of whom...
one of whom has a giant penis.
Now I want you to go
out and kill all women
- with giant penises.
- Oh.
Do you understand?
But that means every wife.
And mother-in-law in Tromaville.
That's the point. Now go, kill
all women with giant penises.
Sir, the president's
wife is on the line.
She heard about your
planned trip to Cuba.
She's really pissed.
Give me that.
I'm not making the
mistake this time.
Yes, Mrs. President.
What? You're coming over here?
You're coming... what time is it?
- Oh! Oh!
- Oh, my God.
Uh, listen, I...
I knew it. I blew it.
You've been with better.
Look, you don't have
to tell me. I know.
My vagina looks like a
slab of roast beef.
And I don't douche as
often as I should.
And I think I might have
queefed in your mouth
- when you went down on me.
- Oh, God, stop. No.
Are you kidding me? It was
the best night of my life.
Did you have any strange dreams?
I had super weird dreams.
Holy shit, me too.
I'm still not sure if
those were dreams.
OMG, I was thinking
the same exact thing.
We could be a lesbianic
Jekyll and Hyde.
Wait, you queefed in my mouth?
No, of course not.
What is up, BFFs?
STFU, Zac.
Check it. An anonymous
contributor to my blog,
Deeper Throat, sent
me some crazy videos
of what actually goes
on at Tromorganic.
The "Tromorganic-Westly Conspiracy"
has to have gone viral by now.
Holy shit.
Are those the missing
Tromaville students?
Yeah, I know. I didn't
believe it myself.
- Uh-huh.
- What is that?
Look at this part.
Look at this part.
Look what he's about to do.
It's so crazy.
They're being slaughtered,
like Bambi's mother.
Okay, guys, to be continued.
Oh, snap.
Oh, shit.
- The Cretins are coming.
- They're gonna sing again.

NASA also gave us some
pretty interesting
derivatives of the space program:
not just Tang... America's
favorite breakfast drink,
but there's the Challenger
explosion of 1986...
America's favorite
shuttle disaster,
and also...
lasers!
When the rubble cleared
after the nuclear meltdown
from the original
"Class of Nuke 'Em High,"
this laser was all that was left.
And, might I add, this
laser is highly unstable.
But I'm sure it no longer works.
Mother of fuck.
Let's go.
We'll never beat Amorville
with that attitude.
Come on, work those thumbs.
What, are you a bunch of girls?
Do you have a...?
Sorry.
Okay, hit the showers.
Lasers can also

Mr. Chips. Mr. Chips.
Can I have a pee-pee pass, please?
Fine. Fine, Zac, just go.
Why don't these fucks in

What you got there, fucker?
Hey, cunt, give it back.
Is that granny's douche

Nice dicks, faggot.
Yeah. Uh, Mr. Chips,
Mr. Chips, our Chrissy

Okay, you want your phone back?
You want your phone back,

Go fucking get it.
You filthy little cunt.
Fight, fight, fight, fight!
You just fucked with the wrong

Give me a break.
Why?
Why?

Both of you, to the

She started it.
In that case, Chrissy Goldberg
to the principal's office.
You've got to be kidding me.
Now!
- Fucker.
- Fuck you.
Fuck you.
Would one of you kind students
please lead me to the
