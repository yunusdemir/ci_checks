"REIJOKYO MOUNTAIN"
Yata is not there.
Is that true?
Yata is not there in
the land of the dead.
I've looked all around and all over,
but couldn't find Yata.
He was not there.
Foreman, you heard what she said.
Every time I ask, she always
tells me that he is not dead.
Mrs. Kane,
I understand exactly how you feel.
But the boat that Yata was on was
wrecked in a storm in the South Seas.
I know Yata is still alive...
But pieces of the wrecked boat were found
after the storm, and the papers said...
No matter what they say, he's alive.
Even so, there's nothing
we can do about it.
Never mind. Ryota went to tell them.
To tell who? Where?
To tell the government.
I know my brother's alive!
Please send another boat out!
Go ask somebody who has a boat.
Then you don't believe
what I'm saying.
- Let me see the police chief.
- No can do.
You see, no jurisdiction.
You understand?
Officer.
I give up.
I can't do anything with him.
A big grown-up reporter
can't handle a kid like that?
But he refuses to budge an inch.
What?
"Marathon Rally Dance Competition"
You're the one who thought he'd make
a good story, you take care of him.
What am I going to do now?
What's wrong?
A fishing boat was lost in
the South Seas a while ago.
And this young kid claims a psychic
says his brother is still alive.
You don't find too many young people
who believe in psychics nowadays.
- Where is he?
- Right in here.
"Marathon Rally Dance Competition"
The dance contest that
is supposed to test the
endurance of today's youth
is now in its third day.
At the start,
there were over 300 dancers.
But right now there are only 15 left
after three days of dancing.
We wonder how long it's going to keep up and who
is going to win the first-prize luxury sail boat.
"First Prize - Luxury Yacht"
I've had it. I've had it.
My legs turned into rubber.
They're all rubber.
There goes our boat.
Too bad, but I thought I had lots
more endurance than this.
I had too much confidence.
Hey, what'll we do now?
Only one thing to do.
Get out of here.
Hey, let's drive down to the beach.
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Maybe he got drunk dancing.
Do you think I can enter the contest?
You're three days late.
But, you see, I've got to have a boat.
Man, he sure is funny.
Yeah, but he came an awful
long way to look at a boat.
So we'll show him one.
Look, boats.
It's true. Do they all belong to you?
Don't be stupid.
But, lchino,
what do you think of that boat?
It's pretty good. You could cross
the Pacific Ocean with that.
This is really wild.
Look at this food.
This could sail across the ocean.
I'd sure like to own this boat.
I wonder what the owner looks like.
I'll show you what he looks like.
Trespassing, breaking and
entering, attempted burglary.
No, it's not that.
Then what?
It's such a beautiful boat,
we just wanted to see it, right?
This boy came from the country just to
see boats. He's a maniac for boats.
I see.
But even if you're maniacs,
you're still trespassing on private property.
- We're sorry.
- All right.
You can stay,
but disappear in the morning.
Disappear?
Just leave.
Now, get some sleep.
Good night, sir!
Idiots! Don't shout!
Hey, get up, get up!
What's happened?
Come off it! Where's my rifle?
Rifle? I don't know.
Why, you bums!
What's that, a toy?
While I was playing with it,
it broke in my hands.
Do you mind?
Why, you...
Get out of here! Get out!
Damn it...
Are you out of your mind?
But we didn't do anything.
You didn't? Then what's that sail?
- I did it.
- What?
I was thinking last night,
and I knew this was a gift of the gods.
Stop jabbering. Turn back.
Can't do that with the gods' gift.
Do it or you'll be sorry.
- I won't.
- Maybe we can do it.
We'll do anything to help.
This guy, he doesn't know
anything about boats.
What?
You'd better be careful,
or you'll get sick.
And now for the local news.
This morning, a yacht was stolen
from Hayama Yacht Harbor.
The vessel, the Yahlen,
owned by American James Conway,
had just been completely
overhauled and provisioned...
for a Pacific Ocean crossing which
was to have started tomorrow.
Hey, don't tell me...
In an early-morning robbery, a thief broke
into the Far East Trading Company offices
...and more than 4 million
yen in cash was stolen.
Police believe it was the
work of only one man...
Why did you turn it off?
The noise makes me seasick.
Don't tell me you're that thief.
Shut up!
That briefcase. What's inside it?
Just keep your hands off it!
Ryota, you still refuse to sail back?
That's right.
And where are we going?
In search of my brother.
Your brother?
Right.
See?
"27 Lost at Sea"
You've gotta be kidding.
Hey, you know how far we've gone?
How should I know?
One thing's for certain. We're going south,
but not in a shipping lane.
I thought about that too. It's about time
we cooperate with that maniac.
If we cooperate with him,
then we can find out how to run this boat.
Then we can turn it around
and sail it all the way back.
I see.
What's that thing you're making?
- A skeleton key.
- A skeleton key?
You have your girlfriends
and I have mine.
So let's all go back and enjoy them.
Then you really are the
burglar we heard about.
Do I look like a burglar?
A toy rifle, skeleton key, briefcase.
You sure look it.
Come out and help me.
We're in trouble!
- What's wrong?
- There are some very strange clouds.
Over there!
Hang on to the boat!
Ryota, watch out!
The helm's broken!
What's that?
A giant claw!
An island.
It's an island!
It's an island! We've been saved!
Nita, get up!
We're safe now! We're saved!
An island!
We're safe now, get up! Get up!
An island!
It is!
You think it's uninhabited?
What was in the briefcase?
Something we couldn't use here.
Anyway, let's climb up.
You go first.
You're the mountain climber.
But I'm so hungry.
We're all hungry. Let's go.
What's wrong?
Cannibals!
No one's around. Now, come on.
Palm trees!
- Maybe there's some fruit on them.
- Let's go see.
Oh, man, I'm full.
I wonder just what this place is.
Well, it certainly isn't deserted.
But judging from this kind of thing,
maybe there are cannibals here.
Don't be funny.
Anyhow, let's look around.
Then we'll decide what to do.
A ship!
Hey! Hey!
They can't hear us? Hey!
It's going to drop anchor in the bay.
Great. Let's go!
- The whole thing stinks.
- What does?
There's something odd
about this setup.
The ship's coming in.
Thank you, Captain.
Guard commander, we've brought
the cargo you ordered.
Hurry up.
X-13 has been delivered.
X-13 has been officially received.
Cease fire!
Return to the ship.
The giant claw.
Ebirah!
Did you see that?
Even if you manage to escape from us,
you can’t get away from Ebirah.
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.
Move!
Hurry up!
Guard commander.
Did you call me, sir?
Have you gone blind?
Sir?
Send up a search balloon at once.
One female slave has escaped.
Right away!
What's wrong?
Who are you?
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait!
Wait.
Hey,
we're not with those men on the boat.
Can't you tell by looking at us?
Okay?
We are friends, get it?
She doesn't understand.
I understand. You said we're friends.
Quick, this way!
This way!
This way!
- Now, jump!
- What?
Careful.
I'll go first.
All right. Go back.
They're gone now.
Hey, there's a cave here.
There's air blowing out.
There must be another opening.
You're right. Come on.
Let's get inside.
It sure made a big hole.
What are you doing?
It didn't work.
It didn't? What didn't?
Mothra couldn't hear that.
Mothra?
Then you mean you came
from Infant Island?
My name is Dayo.
Infant Island?
Tell me, are there any
Japanese on that island?
- There's one.
- What's his name?
He's Yata. A fisherman.
How old is he?
About 23.
He came to the island two months ago.
That's my brother! I'm sure of it.
You must take me there at once.
I can't.
No one can escape from this island.
Ebirah would destroy us all.
Ebirah? Oh, that giant lobster.
Dayo, how did you come to this island?
The Red Bamboo brought
us here by force.
Red Bamboo?
You mean those armed guards.
What are they?
The Red Bamboo.
We know nothing else about them.
Many of our people have
been taken away already.
That belongs to one of us.
I'm sure he was killed
trying to escape.
Stop that! Be quiet and keep working.
Mothra is sleeping now.
But when our prayers reach her mind,
I'm sure Mothra will help us.
You ought to get Mothra an
alarm clock or something.
Stop making fun of her.
You sure are superstitious,
aren't you?
But my brother is still alive.
You believe that?
Right now, I'd believe anything.
Well, what are we going to do now?
We can only wait.
Until Mothra wakes up.
I don't think they'll leave us
alone till then. Call it a hunch.
I don't think they'll bother us.
You've never been chased by the police,
so how would you know?
Well, anyway, we should make the
first attack to protect ourselves.
First, we'll go take
a look at the enemy.
My brother comes first.
I have to get off this
island to help him. I'll go.
All right. Dayo?
I'll go.
Many of my people are slaves there.
All right. That's three.
What about the rest of you?
I'm not going.
I'm not going either.
What's wrong?
I'll go too.
It's Godzilla!
Let's not do this. It's too risky.
Say, I think we ought to think
about it some more first.
How do we get in there?
We'll get in with this.
Will that thing work?
It's always worked for me.
You did steal that money.
A safecracker?
That's not important right now.
Well, I guess you're right.
Whenever I see a locked door,
I get goosebumps.
But all we've got is a sword.
We'll fight them with our
brains instead of guns.
You sound more like
a stupid politician.
Come on.
Keep your eyes open.
Ready?
Now, let's go.
Is it open?
I’m a pro.
Come on!
Safe cracking must be an easy job.
It just seems that way to amateurs.
Come on.
Looks like a laboratory.
Let's see.
What are these?
They look like bowling pins.
They're smoke bombs.
They could be useful.
We'd better take some.
Dayo, we're not shopping. Let's go.
We've just received an
order from headquarters.
They want us to increase
our production.
Beginning this week,
we have to double the lab's output.
It's very easy for
them to issue orders.
We must conduct many tests
before we can tell you for sure.
We don't have the time.
Action comes before words.
Hey, what kind of factory is this?
Who knows.
- I thought you studied science.
- I wasn't a very good student.
But one thing's for sure.
They're not making
ordinary merchandise.
That's going to be a hard one.
Be quiet.
They're coming.
Hey, someone's coming.
Be quiet!
Hey, it's open.
Come on. Hurry up!
We should get going.
Don't! Don't go in! Get out! Quick!
- Why?
- It's a nuclear reactor.
What a surprise.
This is a heavy-water factory.
What's heavy water?
- It's used to make nuclear bombs.
- What? Let's get out of here!
You're still alive.
Stand up.
All right.
Everybody, stand up.
Get out!
Get them! Catch them all!
There they go!
Don't let them get away!
That way.
Watch it! Hurry up!
Watch out! Take this!
We've been spotted.
It's open.
Run!
Quick, this way!
Hands up! Hold it!
Well, it looks like Nita got captured.
That's why I told you
we shouldn't do this.
Ryota's probably dead by now.
If he's lucky,
he can reach Infant Island.
- How can we believe that?
- Quiet!
- What's that?
- They're coming.
Get inside.
Hey, there's only three of us left.
What can we do now?
That's what I'm thinking about.
I won't fight anymore.
What's that noise?
Noise?
He's alive. He's still alive!
That's Godzilla's heartbeat.
Hi!
Uhm... I'm Dayo's friend, you see?
Dayo! What happened to Dayo?
She's fine. She's with my friends now.
Your friends?
What is this stuff?
We make it for the Red Bamboo.
They use it to keep Ebirah
from bothering them at sea.
- Ebirah?
- Yes.
Ebirah can't go anywhere
near this yellow liquid.
I get it.
That's why they sprayed it from
the boat sailing into the harbor.
I'm Ryota! I'm Ryota!
Ryota!
It's Ryota!
Brother! My brother!
Ryota!
So you're alive,
just like that psychic said.
You came looking for me?
I was chased by the
Red Bamboo and almost killed.
Red Bamboo? What's that?
The enemy.
Our enemy.
They live far away, on Devil's Island.
The people who are
taken never come back.
Search all the caves.
Go!
The way they're searching the island,
they'll find us sooner or later.
We've got to do something.
Let's wake Godzilla up.
What's that? What'd you say?
Wake up Godzilla.
If Godzilla wakes up,
they'll stop looking for us.
- We can't do that.
- Why not?
They're making nuclear
weapons here secretly.
- They'll destroy the world.
- Godzilla will do the same.
He won't.
Godzilla doesn't want to do that.
I'm against it.
If we wake Godzilla,
he'll destroy us along with them.
But only we know Godzilla is here.
I don't think they know.
That gives us the advantage.
How do you know they don't know?
It they knew, they wouldn't
come up here after us.
I see. Maybe you're right.
How do we wake him up?
We can use lightning to
shock Godzilla awake.
Lightning?
It might not work,
but didn't you say we
have to use our brains?
Dayo, I hate to take your necklace,
but we need that wire.
All we do now is wait for lightning.
That's it!
Everybody, throw that
yellow liquid away!
And we'll make a big
batch of phony liquid.
We have to use our brains, you see?
Throw away the fruit and
use the leaves instead.
Please think it over once more.
I don't like that the Red Bamboo
is torturing your people.
I must do something.
We understand.
Take this yellow liquid
to use against Ebirah.
Thank you.
Do you have a message for your people?
Tell them to make a large
net and wait for us.
A large net? What for?
You'll know when the time comes.
Now it is time for you to go.
All right, Ryota. Let's go.
Three days now.
Lightning doesn't come very fast
when you wait for it.
Look, I can see the island.
All right. We'll stay here till it's dark.
We'd better eat now.
All right.
Look, those strange clouds again!
Head back.
Back to base.
We're in luck today.
I lost the oar!
The barrels are drifting away!
What'll we do if Ebirah comes out?
Look! It's Ebirah!
It struck.
Look! Another one!
Quick! Let's get to a safe place!
Abandon ship!
Look! He's alive again!
Captain! Emergency! Emergency!
What? Emergency? Is it a revolt?
Contact Headquarters.
Tell them what happened.
Right there, and over there,
we make two more traps.
- To capture Godzilla?
- We can't catch him now.
This is where we are now.
Here are the traps we made last night.
So now, we have to set
more traps around here.
But why?
Use your brain.
The Red Bamboo are still after us.
That's right. Since we woke up Godzilla,
I forgot all about them.
The Red Bamboo!
Are you all right?
I guess so.
It's Ryota!
- Mr. Safecracker.
- Shut up. Who is that?
My brother.
We'll get you down.
Are you all right?
I am Yata. Where are the others?
- They're all prisoners.
- Let's go!
Hey, you can't just drop in as
if you were visiting a friend.
I know that!
Is your brother crazy?
He is. He's always been crazy
to help people in trouble.
Everybody around here is nuts.
But right now, we've decided
to stay here and hide out.
As long as you're safe, you can
forget other people's troubles?
- Ryota, let's go!
- Right.
What now?
We might as well help them.
And it might be a good idea.
We'll go up here.
Hey, work faster. You too.
No matter what you want to do,
we don't have a chance in there.
But we've got to do something.
What are you doing?
Don't be hasty.
I've done a lot of dangerous
things in my lifetime.
But I never stuck my
head in a hornet's nest.
Captain!
Headquarters has sent reinforcements.
Our air force is prepared to take off.
Make sure that everything is ready.
What about the electric fence?
We're ready to put 100,000
volts through the lines.
Captain, we can hear people on
one of our hidden microphones.
All right, let's get away from here.
But I can't let all of them die.
Who said we're going to let them die?
We'll wait until dark.
Then let's wait here.
I don't feel right about staying here.
I don't want to brag,
but I know when I'm being hunted.
Look! My hunch was right!
They're coming!
Spread out and run!
Hey, over there!
Quick! Behind them!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Over there!
Help!
Yata, what can we do?
Don't be stupid.
There's nothing we can do.
All right,
let's look for an opportunity.
Let's try moving in real slow.
How can we help her?
We'll have to wait
till he falls asleep.
All right. Come on.
What's that?
Now's the time.
Let's get Dayo while Godzilla's
occupied with the planes.
Dayo, are you all right?
Run! Run!
Fire!
One hundred thousand volts, now!
Raise the current!
Where's my brother?
Over there!
That idiot!
Wait! Yata, wait!
Yata, over here!
The nuclear time bomb.
Set it on automatic and evacuate!
Hurry up!
Hey, what's going on up there?
Shut up!
Hurry up. Hurry!
Hey, what are you going
to do about us?!
Yoshimura, help us!
Just relax!
My special skill comes in handy.
Stay where you are.
If I push this,
it'll set off the nuclear bomb,
blowing this island to pieces!
What?!
Hey, hey, hey!
Two more hours...
In two hours...
...this island will disappear
from the face of the Earth.
Dammit!
They're escaping.
Damn it!
They got out.
- Nita, you're safe!
- Yeah!
Now, we all have to hurry
and make a large net.
Dayo, help them. Ryota, come on!
- What happened?
- The island's gonna blow up!
That's why they all ran.
So they got away in the boat.
That's right. Serves them right.
- What's wrong?
- They're using phony yellow liquid.
Ebirah!
The yellow liquid, use it all!
Let's hurry!
How is it?
It's not like cracking a safe.
Ryota, maybe you can reach it.
Grab the button and
turn it to the right.
A little further. I can't reach it.
Ow!
This is no time for complaints.
It's no use.
The button keeps dropping.
Damn it.
We have less than 30 minutes!
Let's take it up!
- How did it go?
- No good.
How much time left?
Twenty minutes.
Damn it. Mothra is our only hope now.
- How was it?
- No good.
It's Mothra! Mothra!
Hey, Godzilla's coming this way.
Hurry. Everybody, get in the net.
Everybody, get on. Hurry up! Hurry up!
- Now, everyone hold on tight.
- Don't get shaken off!
I feel sorry for Godzilla.
Run away! Get into the sea!
Run away or you'll be blown up!
Run away!
- Run away!
- He never did us any harm.
That's right. And not only that,
he helped us all to escape too.
Run away!
Well, that island's gone forever.
But it's not the end
of nuclear warheads.
The future is in the hands of
the people who use them now.
Now you sound like a politician.
Well, anyway,
maybe I'll go straight from now on.
Look! Godzilla!
He did escape!
