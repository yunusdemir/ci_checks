Shit.
Mommy.
Mommy, can we play
croquet today?
- Where's Daddy?
- He's running.
From what?
Hey, hey, hey. Shh...
Oh, man.
Come here, come here.
Eat.
- Oh, shit.
- All right.
- Hey. How was your run?
- Uh, good. It was good.
- Abby, eat your breakfast.
- I don't like it.
You do, too. Stop coloring. Eat.
I'm impressed with you keeping it up.
- What brand is this?
- They're all the same.
- Daddy, look, it's your team.
- Hmm?
Oh, hey. That's my team.
That's great, honey. Are they winning?
- Yeah.
- That's more like it. Oh, oh!
- Shit!
- Aw. Hey, hey.
Sweetheart, do not use words like that.
That's a bad word. OK?
- OK.
- Yes, that is a bad word.
Yes, it is.
- What? Don't look at me.
- Mm-hmm. OK.
- Goodbye, sweetie. Goodbye, jelly bean.
- Oh...
- Bye, Daddy.
- You got that?
- Yes. Hey.
- Bye.
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm good. Why?
Just checking.
OK. Bye, guys.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Can I have some more juice?
- Mike!
- Yeah?
- Did you call Fenn about the tree?
- No. I will today.
Please do. I don't want it
coming down on the house.
Yeah, you're right. I will.
Love you.
- I love you too, sweetie. Bye.
- Bye.
Shit.
- Vig?
- I'm down here.
Hi. What's up, Vig?
Donna's out sick. I can't find
anything without her. This sucks.
- Who was that guy?
- Oh. That sucks more.
That's the plumber. I called him
to look at this piece-of-crap boiler.
- Why?
- Why? Because it clanks...
...and it's driving me crazy.
You don't hear this in your office?
No, I hear it.
I just figured that it's old, so--
Well, it is. And he took one look at it
and said we have to replace it...
...because it's gonna blow.
What? We just had it fixed
like three months ago.
He said that job was crap.
That guy did crap work.
Can you believe that?
That little scumbag.
- Unbelievable.
- Um... How much to fix it?
- Did he say?
- Oh, six grand.
- Holy shit!
- That's right.
- Holy shit!
- Tell me about it.
And I gotta tell you,
I... I'm not doing great.
My business is off, and my...
stepson wants to get the LASIK.
Really? Isn't he kind of young for that?
You know, I really don't care,
at this point.
If he wants to get LASIK and it
makes him happy, then he can have it.
OK, so, uh...
...what you want to do here, Vig?
- OK. I was thinking...
...let's just leave it for now.
We just...
...put plastic on the files.
- What do you think?
- No, that sounds great. That's good.
- For now.
- Yeah, fine.
'Cause--
Let's get out of here
before this thing blows.
- I'll get some plastic before practice.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- Good morning, Shelly. How you doing?
A little hungover.
My boyfriend's a moron.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- How'd the team do last night?
- We lost.
- Bummer.
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, so your noon canceled,
so you just have the 10:30 and the 3:00.
- Anything else?
- The toilet's not flushing again.
Should I just call someone this time?
No, I'll take a look at it.
Who have I got at 10:30?
Frank.
- And you think your son stole it?
- Yeah, I know he did.
Mm-hmm.
Why would he steal
your cat, Frank?
He's jealous of her. Very jealous.
Wow. I can see why.
It's a nice-looking cat.
Oh, yeah.
What's Vig
doing with that plastic?
Who knows?
Well, Leo, remember you got lost...
...and the police had to
help you a few times.
That's why we got Jolie
to help you. Right?
So, what do we do now?
Well, if that judge
deems you incapacitated,
then you'll need a guardian.
If we can't find your daughter--
She can't even find herself.
OK. If we can't find her, then
the state will become your guardian.
What state?
Uh...
You know, the state...
of New Jersey.
Well, that's crazy.
I don't need New Jersey's help.
I got Jolie.
And there's nothing going on
between us, so you know.
OK. I'm sure that there's not.
Uh...
Let's first try to find your daughter,
and then we'll go from there, OK?
Am I still hungover
or is that noise getting louder?
You're probably still hungover, Shelly.
We got copies of Leo's financial
statements. The guy's loaded, huh?
Leo? Yeah.
Any luck finding his daughter?
No, that lady is gone.
I have tried everything.
Crap. Let me see his file again, please.
Can't the state just leave him
in his home?
I mean, that's what the guy wants.
Yeah, they could, but they won't.
It's too much work.
They'll probably move him
into Oak Knoll. Pass me a brochure.
But he's got Jolie now.
She can handle it.
No, she can't. The guardian
still has to make all the decisions.
It's the difference between
being a babysitter and a parent.
Well, that's a bummer.
I wish I could do it.
I could use the extra 1,500 a month.
Fifteen hundred dollars?
Is that what the commission is?
Yeah. It's in the file.
I told you, he's loaded.
Mike Flaherty's office.
- Move! Move! Stay right on him.
- Don't cross your feet!
Stay on him!
Keep your chest right down on him!
<i>â™ª Runaway When I say "Go"</i>
- Other man!
- Come on, let's go!
Move, don't cross your feet!
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Whose headgear is this?
Whose headgear?
Stemler, wake up!
- How's the team doing?
- Not good.
- What the hell happened, man?
- We used to be good.
Yeah, well, we're not anymore.
- Shit. Could we stop for a second?
- Yeah.
Holy shit, that sucked.
- You're running good, buddy.
- Yeah.
- You're kicking my ass.
- I'm trying to get out here...
- ...a bit more often, you know?
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What?
- Lori.
Texting me
at seven in the morning,
asking me if I want an antique
sewing table we bought together.
- Do you?
- No! I want my fucking house back!
- Is she still with that guy?
- What, my contractor?
- Yeah.
- Guy I hired? Yeah.
Scumbag's probably walking around
my house wearing his tool belt.
Here. Take a picture.
- Oh, for chrissake.
- Come on, take it.
Come on, it's cold!
- Don't send it.
- It's too late. I hate her.
Maybe you should move back
to the city. Get a new job.
- Uh, shake things up a little bit.
- What?!
Finley called. He's starting a fund
out here in May. I'll wait for that.
That guy is starting up
another fund already? Wow.
- The guy's an animal. He prints money.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Let's finish strong, all right?
- Hold up!
- What?
- What's wrong?
Just hold up.
You OK?
I can't breathe.
- You're breathing funny.
Mike. Holy shit. Mike, you OK?
OK, I'm gonna call somebody.
- Don't call, don't call. I'm fine.
- Come on. Shit.
You gotta be...
Fuck. Shit.
OK, Mike...
Hey, hey. It's OK. Is it your heart?
Buddy, are you having a heart attack?
- No, I'm not having a heart attack.
- What's going on?
- I just can't breathe.
- You could be having a heart attack.
- Mike, come on. Let's lay down.
- No!
It's wet. I don't wanna lay down.
You're dying here. Lay down. Come on.
OK, do me a favor and squeeze my hand.
Squeeze my hand.
- Why?
- Just squeeze it.
- Are you cold?
- Yeah, 'cause I'm lying on the ground.
OK. All right.
I'm gonna blanket you.
Come on, I'm gonna warm you up.
I'm gonna warm you up. It's OK.
- Terry... Oh, Terry.
- Shh! It's OK.
Are you all right?
Sorry!
OK, dude. How long
has that been happening?
Couple of months.
The doctor says it's stress.
Did he prescribe
anything for you?
Yeah, jogging. What the hell do
you think I'm doing out here?
That scared the shit out of me.
What are you so stressed about?
I don't know.
Just work, money, everything.
- Is it that bad?
- Yeah, it is. It is.
I don't know how much longer
I can keep my practice going.
- Really? Holy shit, Mike.
- Yeah.
I've tried everything. I have
no frickin' idea what to do, Terry.
- Have you told Jackie?
- No. Not yet.
I don't want to
freak her out about this.
Good call. All right.
We just have to come up
with a new strategy, right?
Is there anything else
you can do for money?
What am I gonna do, bartend?
I'm a lawyer, Terry. I practice the law.
- I know.
- You know?
It's not like I'm some fricking scumbag.
I help out old people, for chrissake.
No offense, but your pal Finley,
all he gives a crap about is
making money.
Yeah, but that's
why he makes it, Mike.
No shit, Terry.
Thanks for the update.
I'm wrapping up,
be back in a bit.
<i>Sharon called. She wants--</i>
Uh, hey, Jack, I gotta
take this other call. OK?
- All right. Bye.
<i>- All right. Bye.</i>
- Hey, Tom.
<i>- Hey, Mike.</i>
- How are you?
<i>- Good. I'm good, thanks.</i>
- Thanks for getting back to me.
<i>- My pleasure. How you doing?</i>
- I'm good. I'm very good. Yeah.
<i>- Good, good. So, what's up?</i>
Um, listen. I was just following up
to see if you had any overflow.
- It's been a slow month on this end.
<i>- Yeah, look, I gotta be honest, Mike.</i>
<i>It's been a slow month on this end, too.
I've been going through our cases.</i>
<i>We really don't have any overflow
at this point. Sorry about that.</i>
- Right. Yeah, OK.
<i>- I wish I could help you out.</i>
- No, I got it. Of course.
<i>- It's been a slow time here, too.</i>
- No, I appreciate that. Yeah.
<i>- OK, good. If you need to reach out...</i>
Stop. Hold on.
Leo. Hold on a sec, Leo.
- Go back through.
- Somebody stop that gentleman, please.
<i>Any word from his daughter, Mr. Flaherty?</i>
No, Your Honor.
Um, we have the two certified
letters returned unclaimed.
And there is no phone number
for her. We can't find her.
And she is the only
living family, is that correct?
Yes, that is correct, but Mr. Poplar
has not seen her for over 20 years.
- Who?
- Your daughter.
Oh. She's late.
Probably shopping
for some crap or something.
OK.
Thank you, Mr. Flaherty.
OK, as Mr. Poplar has been deemed
incapacitated by this court,
I'm appointing the Office of Public
Guardian to serve as the guardian...
...for his person and property.
Do you have the order
for me to sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Yes, I sure do, Your Honor.
Then please approach.
Your Honor, if it pleases the court...
Yes, Mr. Flaherty? What is it?
I would be willing to serve
as Mr. Poplar's guardian.
- Really?
- Yes.
You've known him how long?
Two weeks?
More like five.
Really? And you want to be
his guardian now?
- May I approach, Your Honor?
- Counsel, approach.
What's going on, Mike?
Judge, I feel that I would be
a better candidate than the state...
- ...in this particular case.
- Really?
Yes. Stop saying,
"Really," Stu. It's annoying.
I live in the same town
as Mr. Poplar.
Proximity hardly qualifies him
as a guardian, Your Honor.
And, as his lawyer,
I feel that I am in a better position...
...to execute exactly what my client wants.
Your Honor, Mr. Flaherty is Mr. Poplar's
court-appointed attorney.
I know, Stu. I appointed him.
Yeah, well, that hardly
qualifies him as a guardian.
- Why should we go along with this?
- Mike?
Judge, Leo has told me
that he wants to live at home.
He has the money to do that.
And I wanna make sure that happens.
- Now, if the state can do that, fine.
- Counsel knows we can't do that.
Your Honor, we're spread too thin to
give that kind of individual attention.
But there is an excellent eldercare
facility in Mr. Poplar's town.
- We'll put him there.
- Mr. Poplar wants to live at home.
You can do that, Mike?
Yes, I can. Really.
Did we win?
Uh...
Yeah, I think we did.
Good.
Are we going to the park?
No, we're not going to the park, Leo.
I'm gonna help you
settle into a new place...
...so you can live right here in town.
Wait, I don't need a new place.
I have a house.
I don't need that fancy stuff.
I know. I just need you to live
in this place for a little while.
It's very nice. You're gonna like it.
Did the judge say that?
Yes, the judge said so.
Shit.
OK?
<i>â™ª Still all my song shall be â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Nearer, my God, to thee â™ª</i>
- Have a great day, gentlemen.
- You bet.
All right. Come on, crazy-legs.
- Let's go, Mr. Mayor. It's cold.
- OK.
- We have to get bagels for your mom.
- OK.
- I just have to make one stop first.
- Where?
I gotta swing by a client's house
and shutoff his water.
- Why'?
- 'Cause, uh, it's freezing out.
- I don't want his pipes to burst.
- No, I mean why are you doing it?
Uh... Oh!
Because I'm his guardian.
- What? Since when?
- Since last week.
Well, that's a big deal, Mike.
Were you even gonna tell me?
It's not a big deal.
I was gonna tell you.
It is so! You don't have time
to take care of an old man.
Jack, he's at Oak Knoll.
They take care of everything.
I just have to check in on him
from time to time.
- Well, who pays for that?
- He does. Come on, kiddo.
It comes out of his estate.
And he can afford it, trust me.
Well, I don't get it.
You've never done it before.
- No, I haven't.
- So why are you doing it now?
Because, sweetheart, it's just
the right thing to do, all right?
We couldn't find his daughter,
and I just wanna help the guy out.
That's all. It's not a big deal.
Well, it sounds like a big deal.
You should have told me.
What's a big deal?
- Is this gonna take long?
- Nope. It'll be two minutes.
- Who's that?
- No idea.
- Who is that, Mommy?
- I don't know, honey.
Daddy's gonna find out.
- How you doing? Can I help you?
- No.
- You looking for Mr. Poplar?
- Yeah.
- Oh. He doesn't live here anymore.
- Where does he live?
Mind telling me
why you're looking for him first?
He's my grandfather.
I came to live with him.
Oh.
So do you live
around here, Kyle?
No. Ohio.
Ohio?
Where are your parents?
It's just me and my mom, but she's
back in Columbus. She couldn't come.
- How did you get here?
- Bus.
- Really? All by yourself?
- Yeah.
That sounds like a big deal.
Hey, Leo, how you doing?
You have a visitor.
- Who? Him?
- Yeah.
Hey.
Come on in. I'll turn off the TV.
<i>Let's just kick it around,
as they say, man-to-man.</i>
This is, uh, Kyle Timmons, Leo.
He's your grandson.
- Came from Ohio to see you.
- I don't have a grandson.
Yeah, you do.
We just never met.
You gonna bring me home?
No, he's just here for a visit.
Oh.
OK. You want to watch a little TV?
Yeah. Sure.
<i>Well, I'm very good at keeping secrets.</i>
<i>There's some things
I won't even tell myself.</i>
<i>- What is it, son?
- You're looking at it.</i>
All right. So I'll pick you up
in about an hour.
OK.
<i>...like everybody does, Father,
only you're too polite to say anything.</i>
- So you called his mother?
- No, not yet.
Oh. He was smoking, too.
He's 16.
- Well, he's probably on drugs.
- I know.
What are you gonna do with him?
We're gonna send him back,
is what we're gonna do.
Well, I certainly hope so.
You got your hands full over there.
Now taking care of that old man, too?
Sounds like too much, Mike.
It is too much. And somehow
he forgot to tell me all about it.
- I told you.
- No, not until I asked.
His daughter should be taking care of
him, not you. You got me to worry about.
I don't have to worry about him.
He's at Oak Knoll, so--
Daddy, can we play
croquet today?
The whole thing
just sounds crazy.
It is crazy. It's crazy.
Who's crazy?
Me.
So he lives here now?
Uh-huh.
Your grandfather's in the early
stages of dementia, Kyle,
so he needs a little help.
Are you a friend of his
or something?
Uh, I'm his guardian.
What does that mean?
I make sure that
he's well taken care of.
That's cool.
<i>Meow, meow.</i>
<i>Meow, meow, meow, meow...</i>
Oh, hey.
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.
- Did you reach your mom?
- Yeah. I told her I was coming home.
Did she wanna
talk to me or anything?
No.
OK. Well, I'm sorry
you can't stay longer.
But maybe you can come back
again and visit with your mom.
Yeah, maybe.
If I wanna smoke, should I go outside?
- You shouldn't be smoking.
- I know, but if I do.
Then you should go outside.
All right. Good night, Jackie.
Good night, Kyle.
What are you doing?
We have kids, Mike. I'm not taking
any chances with Eminem down there.
There's not even
a bathroom down there, Jack.
Can you get these people
to get me some Cocoa Puffs?
- I really like them.
- You got it, Leo.
That Mike is a stand-up guy.
You need cereal, go see him.
OK. We should go, Kyle.
OK. Bye, Leo.
- You going to work?
- No, I'm going home.
Don't take any shit
from any of those guys.
I won't.
Here's 50 bucks,
in case you need it.
I have money.
Actually, it's only 43, but take it.
You never know.
I have enough money,
but thanks.
OK.
- Well, good luck, Kyle.
- You, too, Mike.
Hello.
- Yes, it is.
- Who is it?
What?
- Take care, fellas.
- Yeah, all right, Mike.
- So, what happened?
- I decided not to go home.
Then you decided you'd break
into your grandfather's house?
You mind if I have
a quick smoke?
Yes, I do. Get in the car.
You wanna talk about it?
Not really.
Well, good luck with that, pal.
Oh, you'll see.
Kyle, we can't help you
unless you tell us what's going on.
Is there a reason
you don't wanna go home?
What happened to your eye?
Kyle, you can trust us.
Really.
I can't live there anymore.
With your mom?
Did she do that to your eye?
No. She's not even there. She's
at a clinic or a hospital or something.
- I'm living with Craig.
- Who's Craig?
Her boyfriend, I guess,
but he's an asshole.
Does she even know you're here?
My mom? She doesn't care about me.
How do you know?
She's probably worried sick...
...and doesn't know
how to reach you.
She could've called, right?
We don't have a choice now.
Ah. So what are
we gonna do, adopt him?
No.
But I'm not sending him back there
until I talk to his mom.
- She better freaking call me back.
- Honey...
Honey, I know that this is tough,
but we're not in a position...
...to take care of another
kid right now.
I don't care. I'm not sending
him back there. I can't.
For the record,
I'm not very happy about it.
- Fine. Then we don't have to do this.
- Yes, we do, Mike. We do.
It makes me so angry and so damn sad
to see him in this situation.
- He's just a kid.
- Yeah, I know. I know.
I wanna go to Ohio
and beat the crap out of his mom.
- OK, come on.
- No, I do.
I wanna beat the crap out of her
and her stupid boyfriend.
OK.
- I'm serious.
- I know you are.
I just... I don't think that
beating the crap out of everybody...
...is the best solution. That's all.
It feels like it.
<i>It's just one thing after another, know what I mean?</i>
So get rid of him again.
<i>No, I can't. We gotta figure out
what's going on back there.</i>
- Have you talked to his mother?
<i>- No, not yet.</i>
<i>Jackie's left her like 30 messages.</i>
<i>So, I don't know,
she's driving me crazy.</i>
Motherfucker.
He is wearing his tool belt.
<i>What? Who?</i>
No, nothing, dude.
Sorry. I'm distracted.
Where the hell are you?
Are you watching Lori's house again?
It's my fucking house. And, no.
- I'm driving.
- Where's the kid now?
Inside my waiting room.
Jackie made me take him with me.
<i>- Listen to me, Mike.
- You listening?</i>
Mm-hmm.
<i>This isn't the time to long that stock.
Know what I mean?</i>
No. What does that mean?
You need to do what's best
for you right now, Mike.
OK? That's not taking care
of another kid, especially a convict.
Yeah. Well, tell that to my wife, OK?
- I found her.
- Let me call you back.
<i>- Get rid of the convict, Mike.</i>
- Yeah, OK.
She's in a drug treatment program
in Columbus. Got five weeks to go.
Jesus Christ. Can I talk to her?
No, they said she would call you.
Kind of a sweet kid,
but what's up with the hair?
Who the hell knows? Yeah.
- Hey, Mike.
- Hi.
- Hey, Shelly.
- Hi.
You think I can go see Leo?
Um, yeah, sure. OK.
You know where it is?
- Yeah. It's down the street, right?
- Uh-huh.
OK. But just stay there,
and I will come get you about three.
Yeah. Later.
Later.

Rew, what the hell are you doing?
Get down there. Coach!
Phil, shut that off.
- Watch it, guys.
- Everybody, watch this.
Hey! Everybody, watch,
because none of you are doing it right.
Get your chest on him.
That's a little too much.
A little bit further back, Coach.
- Like this?
- Uh... Good, right there.
Now, get your full weight up on
your toes. Put your full weight on him.
Like that. Cross-face, grab the
ankle, and drive right through.
- Good.
- Yo, what up, pancake?
Shut the hell up, Chewbacca.
- No, more like the Secret Apprentice.

you something here!
And you are all screwing around.
Shut up!
Quiet!
The last time that I checked,
we haven't won a single match.
- Right, Coach?
- It's embarrassing.
It's embarrassing! I'm not getting
paid enough to sit here and jerk around.
- I don't know about you.
- I'm not getting paid enough.
I care about what I do!
So does Coach Vig!
And so should you!
Run them, Coach. Run them.
I can't stand looking
at these punks anymore.
Let's go, ladies!
Here. Have some more corn.
Thank you.
I'll get you
some more milk, too.
Thanks.
Mike, did you call Fenn about the tree?
Uh...
Yeah. But I talked to Terry, and
I think the two of us can do this--
Oh, no, no, don't start.
You two are not cutting down that tree.
Just call Fenn.
I'm gonna get her some Tylenol.
Do you wanna play croquet?
- When?
- When it's warm out.
- Yeah. Maybe.
- Cool.
Sweetie.
Daddy, can I watch TV?
Yes, you can,
but just a half an hour, all right?
Hey, Mike. You think I could
practice with you guys tomorrow?
Yeah, if you want. Sure.
All right, thanks.
By the way, what I did in there today,
yelling like that,
I don't usually do that.
That's OK. They deserved it.
I don't have wrestling shoes.
Don't worry about it.
Did you ever wrestle before?
Yeah.
- Take it easy, all right?
- All right.
Come on, get an ankle! Get an ankle.

<i>â™ª She's coming at me
like a wrecking ball... â™ª</i>
Man, it's cold.
- You have fun?
- Yeah.
- When's the last time you wrestled?
- Couple years ago.
Why'd you stop?
Just felt like it.
Oh.
Hey, let me ask you something, Kyle.
How good are you?
I'm Pretty good.
Holy shit.
- Holy shit.
- Did you see it?
- This is the kid? Kyle Timmons?
- That's the kid.
- Wow.
- Yeah, right?
He finished second
at the states in Ohio.
Ohio's tough, dude.
Says here he had 17 pins
his freshman year.
- What is that?
- I'm playing Wii Golf.
- Oh. That's cool.
- Yeah, I'm awesome.
What'd he do
his sophomore year?
Uh, I don't know. I couldn't find
anything. I don't think he wrestled.
- Why?
- I don't know.
He doesn't talk much.
He's kind of a weird kid.
- You want another beer?
- Yeah.
Why can't I have one kid on my team
like that, you know? Just one.
Well, you do. Right there.
Take that kid to states.
He's not on the team. He's not even a student.
He's been here for three days.
- So what? Enroll him.
- I can't enroll him.
He's just here until we reach his mother
and we figure this out.
All right. So he's gotta do
something. Just let him wrestle.
- That's a nice bowl, man. Oh.
- Yeah. Wedding gift. Yeah.
Dude, look at it this way.
You're helping the old man out,
and this kid is like a bonus
for doing the right thing.
Yeah, I'm not just
helping the old man out, Terry.
It's not like it's charity work,
you know? I'm getting paid for it.
Yeah, no shit, Mike.
Everybody gets paid.
But, dude, think about it, all right?
What are the odds of this kid
ending up on your doorstep...
...and wrestling like that?
That's a sign.
Check it out. One of his matches.
He's setting him up. See?
He's setting him up.
- He's gonna throw him.
- There he goes.
- Oh, my God!
- High five! Yes!
Whoo!
OK. Here's five dollars for lunch.
I have no idea what it costs,
but let me know when you find out.
- I have money, but thanks.
- Good for you. Save it.
Come on, take it.
It's too early to argue.
- OK. I'm ready. Let's go, pal.
- All right.
See you tonight.
- Bye, Jackie.
- Bye.
- Hey.
- Yeah. Hold on.
- You sure we should do this?
- Why not?
I mean, if he's here
two more days or two weeks,
it gives him something to do.
Unless you want him hanging out here.
No, you're right. We should do it.
- Hey, Mike.
- Uh-huh?
We got a check from
Leo Poplar's trust for $1,500,
but it's made out to you,
not the firm.
Uh-huh. Yeah, right. I'll take that.
Shouldn't I deposit it
in the business account?
Um...
No, it's not a legal fee,
it's a personal fee.
For what?
I ended up taking on Leo's guardianship.
Really?
- Yeah. Didn't I mention that to you?
- You definitely didn't mention that.
Yeah. It just ended up playing out
that way. I gotta get going, OK?
Well, can we put some of that
in the business account...
...so they don't take our copier back?
No, not this time.
Next month, I promise. Bye, Shelly.
- We need our copier, Mike.
- I know.
And that noise is getting louder.
I'm not hungover today.
- That's good.
- That's good?
Hey, honey.
No, I'm good. Yeah, listen,
can you do me a favor?
Mail the health insurance check.
I forgot to mail it.
No, I think it's on the desk.
Hey. What up, fellas?
Hitting the showers, huh?
That sounded weird.
- The guy's unbelievable.
- You want me to talk to Reed?
No, let me check with Kyle first.
- Oh, yeah, coaches' office. Hey, Vig.
- Hey, Terry.
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?
What do you think?
I gotta see this kid.
He's incredible.
He's good to wrestle.
- Mike cleared him.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- All right.
So where we at?
Uh, where we at? We're trying
to figure out where he fits in.
Wherever the hell he wants, right?
- Uh, no, not right.
- Unfortunately, we have a system here.
Excuse me, Vig.
Hey, Kyle. Come on in. How's school?
- It's OK.
- Good. This is my friend, Terry.
Hey, man. Good to meet you.
Great to meet you. Huh? Welcome.
- Thanks.
- Terry. Terry.
- How are the shoes?
- They're good.
- Good.
- Here you go.
I wanted to ask you something, Kyle.
Uh, you think you might wanna
wrestle in a match?
- OK.
- Good.
Good. We got one on Saturday.
What do you wrestle?
I used to wrestle 103,
but that's not gonna happen.
- I could probably make 119 by Saturday.
- Excellent. Done.
- Ter.
- Sorry.
- Is there anyone there now?
- Jimmy Reed, but he's not very good.
Yeah, but he might actually
be better off at 125, Vig.
- Don't you think we should wrestle off?
- Yeah.
"UNTIL THE DAY"]
<i>â™ªThere's no place I'd rather be
than anywhere else but here â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Can't you see that I'm sick and tired
of all the bullshit â™ª</i>
Good luck, man.
Thanks.
- OK, let's get them started.
- OK.
Wrestle off!
- All right, let's go.
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Keep time, Vig?
- I'll do it. You don't mind, do you?
No, go ahead.
- Nice.
- What?
Let's go, guys. Shake hands.
Wow. That is really fast.
That's really fast.
Yes!
- Good match.
- Didn't feel good.
I don't think we can teach him anything.
Just being in that place brought back
all the memories, I gotta say.
The smell.
It's like a form of self-abuse.
Were you guys really that bad?
- Mike was actually average.
- Yeah.
- Right? I sucked. Sorry, Abby.
- It's OK.
You were really better than Terry?
- I don't know--
- Mike was scrappy.
Abby, your dad was like an angry
little ferret when he wrestled.
Not for nothing, but we should
have quit and joined the ski club.
We could have gotten busy with
Alison Shepherd on the overnights.
- Terry.
- Who was busy?
Your Uncle Terry's just being silly.
Sorry, Abby. Getting busy is bad.
- So is getting married.
- For crying out loud.
- Terry!
- Getting married is bad?
Different viewpoints are important,
Abby. Right, Michael?
No, not right, Terry.
You really need to get
back up on the horse.
- OK, Mom.
- We should probably get going.
I have to stop by the office.
How do you think
we'd do against Kyle, like, now?
- Are you kidding me?
- He'd kill us. Both of us, together.
Yeah. Yeah, you're probably right.
- Kid's got man strength, dude.
- Man strength?
Mmm. You know. Like,
not kid strength, man strength.
I wouldn't say that
around the locker room, Terry.
What the hell are you
doing in there, anyway?
Trying to figure out what's wrong
with my f ricking backup system.
Just call your IT guy.
I don't have an IT guy.
IT guys cost money.
Right.
You know what? I'm just gonna
say what's on my mind here.
I wanna be an assistant coach, too.
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Why not?
Dude, I'm value added,
especially compared to Vig.
How are you value added?
Well, first of all, I'm fun.
There's no denying that.
And secondly, unlike Vig,
I actually used to wrestle.
- Yeah, but, Ter, you sucked.
- Mike, come on. I'm serious here.
I need some distraction
in my life right now.
I'm sitting in that condo, just
thinking about Lori and that guy...
...having sex in the Jacuzzi I paid for.
It's fucking unhealthy.
I'm going kind of crazy right now.
Really.
We start at 3:30 pm.
Don't be late.
My brother. Hey,
I'm not gonna let you down.
- To the team.
- All right.
What should I wear
to my first practice?
- Just a singlet.
- Seriously?
Yeah, so we can see your man strength.
<i>Incoming call. Do you copy?</i>
<i>Incoming call. Charlie Squadron taking
heavy fire. Requesting air strike--</i>
Hello. Hello?
This is Jackie Flaherty,
Kyle's staying with us.
Oh, I am gonna kill that lady.
- Hi.
- Your phone rang.
Your mom called.
You answered it?
Yeah. We've been waiting
to hear from her.
What'd she say?
She didn't say anything.
She hung up. You talk to her?
No, but can you please not
answer my phone anymore?
Yeah. Uh, yeah, you're right. Sorry.
Oh. Here. You really shouldn't
be smoking, but if you do,
- could you put the butts out in here?
- I quit.
Now that I'm wrestling again,
I can't smoke.
Pretty cool, right?
Yeah, it's very cool.
- Was that Abby?
- Mmm...
If it is, she just ran away.
Hey. Were you outside?
Yeah. I went for a run.
Oh. It's pretty early.
You do that every morning?
In season, yeah.
- Huh.
- Oh, um...
You think I can use
the weights in the closet?
Absolutely. Help yourself.
- All right. Thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.
That was Kyle.
He was working out.
Is he gonna do that
every morning?
In season, yeah.
I hate you.
Timmons.
One-nineteen. Good.
One-nineteen, got it.
- Look at those tattoos.
- Kid is so f ricking cool.
One-twenty-five, Dreadlow.

- This song sucks.
- Rew picked it out. He's an odd one.
- Vig, which one is your kid?
- None of them. He quit.
- Really? Your son quit?
- My stepson.
I thought it'd be a nice way to bond,
but he said it wasn't fierce and quit.
Harsh. So, what are you
still doing it for?
Vig is leading by example.
Winners never quit, right, Vig?
That's right,
even if I'm not fierce.
Um, I sit there.
Sorry, buddy, I gotta sit
next to Mike. It's good luck.
- Says who?
- Guys. Guys.
I don't think we should fight
about our seats in front of the kids.
- I'm not really fighting.
- Come on.
All right.
Sit wherever you want.
I feel overdressed.
Let's go, guys.
Up! There you go! Shoot!
- Take him down, Carlos!
- Come on.
- There you go.
- All right, Carlos.
All right.
- Good match.
- Yeah, great, thanks.
- Hey. OK, you ready?
- Yeah.
OK. This kid is good, so, you know,
you just be ready out there.
- OK. Can you give me a slap?
- What?
Give me a slap me across the face,
like you're trying to wake me up.
Uh-huh.
OK. Like that?
Yeah, but a little harder.
Go ahead, hit him.
- Timmons.
- Let's go, Kyle!
- Let's go, Kyle. Take this punk out!
- Oh, Terry, hey, cut the shit, man.
You're a coach.
You're not sitting in the stands.
- I get excited. You know how I get.
- Yeah, I know.
I'm just coaching. Come on, buddy.
- Let's go, Pioneers!
- Here you go, Jake.
Hand fight.
Get inside, hand fight!
- That's it!
- OK, Kyle.
- Let's go, Kyle!
- Get your head up!
- Stay on him!
- Don't let that go.
- Get off your knees.
- Off your knees.
- Focus up.
- Go on, Kyle!
- Let's win one, Pioneers!
- Fresh start.
- Your style!
- Don't let him press you!
- Hey, get out of that.
- Keep the leg back!
- Get out of that.
- Get out, Kyle. Come on.
- Two, red.
- Keep working, keep working.
Get back on base!
- What the hell is he doing?
- Losing.
It's his first match,
give him a break.
- Get him flat.
- Eye on the prize.
- OK, stay on him.
- Hey. You OK?
- Did he smile?
- Yeah, I think he did.
Get him to the mat.
- Hey, beautiful!
- Here we go!
- Pioneers!
- Nice.
- Told you I'm good luck.
- Had nothing to do with luck.
Beautiful. How'd that feel? Pretty good?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. OK.
- You ready?
- Yeah. Can you slap me too, Coach?
Uh-huh.
<i>Well, I said you cannot
touch the other gloves...</i>
I'm off to the market. Be back in a bit.
- Can I go with you?
- Uh, yeah, OK.
All right. Let me grab
my sweatshirt real quick.
- I wanna go with Kyle.
- No, sweetheart,
it's almost time for bed. OK?
- Please?
- No.
Oh, Cocoa Puffs.
Is that your brand?
- No, they're for Leo.
- Nice. Drop it in. It's on me.
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.
How's he doing?
He's OK. He can say
some pretty funny things, though.
- The other day he told me I was fired.
- Fired? For what?
- I don't know. He just fired me.
- I think I have to meet this Leo.
Grab me two spaghettis.
Thanks.
Do you have any homework?
A little. I hate homework.
You ever think
of going to college?
Yeah, but just to wrestle.
My old coach thought
I could get a scholarship.
Yeah, I heard you were
pretty good. Why'd you quit?
That's OK. You don't have to tell me.
- You like tacos?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Me, too.
I make a mean taco.
Let's go! Let's stay focused!
Focus, guys! Good things will come!
OK, Coach,
let's bring them in.
Come on!
Let's go. Sit down!
- Have a seat.
- Bring it in.
All right. I wanna spend this week
working on bottom position.
Stemler.
Now, did you guys all see what Kyle did
the other day? He exploded up, right?
Kyle, show the guys what you did.
It's kind of my own thing.
Well, can you share it with us?
- But it's not even a move or anything.
- That's OK.
All right.
Well, I just tell myself that
the guy on top is trying to take...
...my head and shove it
underwater and kill me.
And if I don't wanna die on bottom,
I have to do whatever
the fuck it takes to get out.
OK. So the move is,
"whatever the fuck it takes."
- Let's go. Let's work on it!
- Whatever the fuck it takes!
- Let's go, gentlemen! Up!
- Come on, guys.
<i>You think because you pay the bills,
you have the right for all the say,</i>
<i>you don't see to her,
you don't care for her...</i>
Your mother wouldn't come, huh?
- No.
- That girl was always a tough kid.
She say bad things about me?
Yeah, but I never listen to her anyways.
But you should. That's your mother.
Respect that.
Could you turn that down?
I hate that judge.
She's the reason I'm here.
- But, Leo, this place is pretty nice.
- But it's not my house.
I paid for my house.
I own my house!
- Damn judge. Shut it off!
<i>- ...this woman, $1,500 in transition...</i>
You wanna
go for a walk outside, Leo?
Yeah. Let's go to my park.
Your park, huh?
Yeah, my park.
- Hey, did you bring the tape?
- Yeah, it's in my bag.
- Mike, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm? Yeah. Of course. What?
Leo told me that some judge
made him move into that place.
- He said that, huh?
- Yeah.
Is that true,
or is he just making it up?
Uh... No, that's true, pal.
- Why?
- Well, because they take...
...really good care of him there, you know?
- But he wants to live at home.
- I know.
I know. It's, uh... it's complicated.
Sorry.
Hello.
Yes, this is him.
Oh, hi.
Yeah, can you hold on
just a moment, please? Thanks.
Uh, I gotta take this.
I'll be in in a minute, OK?
- All right.
- Thanks.
What? She doesn't even know us.
Yeah. Well, I think she heard that
I'm a lawyer, and I have a family,
and that was good enough.
- For how long?
- Another month,
- until she gets out of rehab.
- A month?
- Yes.
- Holy crap.
But, you know, she said
that this Craig guy took off,
and she really sounded kind of shaky.
I can't believe this lady.
No, I know.
- Where is he, anyway?
- In the basement with Abby.
- This is crazy.
- Yes, it is.
So what do we do?
We let him stay. I don't know.
Do we even have a choice?
I guess we don't.
What's up?
- You nervous?
- No.
- I am.
- You're not wrestling.
Yeah, I know, I'm just nervous a lot.
You ever think about
wrestling in a match?
Yeah, I'm just waiting for the
green light from coach, you know?
Yeah. That's cool.
Dude, I'm glad I'm not wrestling today.
These guys are ranked fourth in state.
You're wrestling Kenny Randall.
He's undefeated. He's tough.
Really tough.
Whole team's tough.
I hate going to this f ricking place.
Maybe that's why you're nervous.
Yeah. Maybe.
All right, cut the chatter!
Cut the chatter!
Now, you should all be playing
the "What if" game.
What if he shoots a single leg?
What if he controls my wrist?
What if we all got pinned
like last year?
Stemler, I swear to God, I'm gonna
throw you right off this bus myself.
- Now, shut up.
- My bad, Coach Vig.
Shut up!
- Way to go, Stemler.
- Shut up, Stemler.
- They really pin all of you?
- Just about.
It's gonna be
a fucking bloodbath.
All right, Carlos. Kyle.
OK. This is Kenny Randall.
He's very good.
- Yeah, I heard.
- All right, but you have an advantage.
He has no idea who you are, right?
So he's gonna be overconfident.
Take advantage of that.
He's gonna come at you, definitely.
Use his momentum, take a shot,
and put him away. OK?
- OK.
- Yeah?
...and Randall, Sheffield.
- Why'd Daddy hit Kyle?
- I have no idea.
- Come on, guys.
- Focus, Kyle, focus.
Let's go, baby. Let's go, Kyle!
Look alive! Look alive!
Let's go, come on! Come on!
Be a winner, Kyle!
- Shake hands.
- Don't wait.
Go after him.
Come on. Let's go.
- Just take your time, Kenny.
- Work around, take him down.
No way.
Holy shit. Holy shit! Holy shit!
- He just pinned Kenny Randall.
- Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!
Guys, guys, guys, calm down.
Calm down, calm down, all right?
- There you go, Kyle!
- How about that?
- He knows who I am now.
- You're damn right he does!
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Can I watch TV in here?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh. Wait, I wanna
show you something first.
- Stella, who's that?
- Kyle.
She started doing that
at the wrestling match today.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
OK, I gotta ask. Those tattoos.
They must have hurt, right?
- Not really.
- No, come on, don't lie to me.
Look. I got it on spring break.
Hurt like hell.
- What does it say?
- JBJ.
Jon Bon Jovi? I'm a fan.
- Really?
- Yes, really.
I'm a Jersey girl.
You got a problem with that?
No, I do not.
That was fun today. You're good.
- I'm glad you started wrestling again.
- Yeah. Me, too.
- No quitting this time. You got that?
- Yeah.
- Can I tell you something?
- Of course.
I didn't quit my old wrestling team.
I got thrown off.
- Why?
- I stole a car.
- What? You don't even drive, do you?
- No. That was part of the problem.
- Whose car did you steal?
- A teacher's.
- Oh, my God.
- I know.
- It was really stupid.
- Yeah, it was really stupid.
- You could have killed yourself.
- Yeah.
Everything just got
messed up after that.
Hey. We all do stupid things.
But the good news is
you got another chance.
And you're kicking butt.
- That's the way to do it.
- Yeah, I guess.
Oh, totally is.
You know who'd agree with me?
- Mike?
- No.
JBJ.

Oh, well, this is
a team for the ages.
- Hey, guys. What's up?
- Stemler wants to wrestle today.
Ter.
Oh.
- You do?
- Yeah, Coach.
I'm pretty sure
I'm ready. Right?
Right.
Where you gonna wrestle, Stemler?
He can wrestle at 119.
If I bump up to 125 and get a pin,
and Jimmy goes 130,
then we're only giving up one weight
class and we actually have a shot.
- Vig?
- Yeah. He's right.
- It's possible.
- Stemler,
have you ever wrestled
in a match before?
No, I have not.
He's just waiting
for the green light, right?
Right. I think now's my time.
I feel the Force.
- One twenty-five.
- OK.
OK, we're gonna start 125,
DePasquale and Timmons.
And then finish 119,
Tomlinson and Stemler.
I'm ready, Coach.
- Showtime.
- Good.
- Oh, boy.
- It's gonna be fine.
- Hook him, come on!
- That's it! Now hold on to him!
Hook the arm, Carlos,
that's it! Stay on him!
Hang on to him! Hang on to him!
- Yeah!
- Very good.
Good boy, good boy, good boy.
Great, Carlos! Awesome.
- How we doing?
- Holy shit, we can win this thing.
He's right. If Stemler doesn't get
pinned, we can win. We're up five.
- That's a huge fucking "if
- I can hear you, Coach.
Sorry, Stemler.
OK, come on, Stemler, let's go.
OK. All right, buddy.
You've been practicing a long time.
- A long time.
- Yeah. Yeah.
And you're ready for this, OK?
You get in trouble out there,
you just listen to me. I'm right here.
OK? All right?
Stemler, you're not gonna get pinned.
You are not gonna get pinned. No way.
No way, all right?
Now, I'm gonna slap you. You ready?
Yeah, but not so hard.
- Thanks.
- OK.
Let's get this going here!
- Oh, oh! You gotta check in.
- Sign in.
Let's go, Stem! Let's go!
You got this!
Holy shit, it's Darth Vader.
Are you kidding me?
- No way.
- What?
I can't do this. No.
- What are you...?
- Don't take that off.
- It's just a mask.
- For chrissake, Stemler.
- Stemler.
- It's a protective mask.
What's going on?
If he's Darth Vader,
you're the Secret Apprentice.
You got this.
Ref,
what's he doing?
OK?
- All right.
- Let's go.
All right, Stemler.
Let's go, Stem.
- Good man, let's go. Let's go.
- All over him. Right here.
- Shake hands.
- Don't give him an inch.
- All right, Stemler.
- All right.
- Good.
- All right.
OK.
Thattaboy.
Good start. All right.
- Just keep trying.
- I can't watch this.
- Let's go, ref!
- This kid's not doing anything!
- It's stalling!
- Doing great, Stemler.
- Come on, Stemler!
- Focus.
- Keep it going!
- Tough it out, buddy!
- All right, Stemler.
- Stalling, green. One, red.
- Shit. Shit.
- Just keep going.
We're one point from a tech fall.
We're gonna lose this on criteria.
- No shit. Really?
- If he loses by 15 points,
it's a technical fall, and even though
the score is tied, we're gonna lose.
- Seriously?
- All right, fuck this.
Hey, Stemler. Stemler!
Listen to me. You need to get up, buddy!
All right? He is trying to drown you!
He wants you dead! OK?
But you are not gonna die
on the bottom, are you, Stemler? Right?
You hear me?
All right, you remember the move?
Whatever the fuck it takes.
- Whatever the fuck it takes! Get up!
- Come on, Stemler!
Wrestle him! Wrestle him!
Let's go, Stemler!
Keep going, buddy!
Go shake his hand. Shake his hand!
Thank you very much.
I'm proud
of what you did today.
That win meant
a lot to the guys.
- Yeah. Good coaching with Stemler.
- Yeah.
Let me ask you something, Kyle.
What's it like
to be as good as you are?
- What's that feel like?
- I don't know.
I guess it just feels
like I'm in control.
Of everything, you know?
Yeah, I do. Must be nice.
It is.
- Get your leg free.
- Greg, get your leg free.
Gotta get your leg free. Arch your back!
Arch! Arch! Fight! Arch! Fight it!
Get your leg free!
Get your leg free! Arch! Up, up, reach!
Reach! Fight it!
- District champs, baby.
- Yep.
- Pure fucking poetry, baby!
- District champs, baby.
- Hey, Leo.
- Yeah.
- Guess who just won the districts.
- Who?
I did.
- Check it out.
- Wow.
- And guess what.
- What?
Mike got a call
from a college scout about me.
- Yeah?
- Hi, baby.
What are you doing here?
I just came to get you, honey.
And to see Grandpa.
Baby, I missed you so much.
Can I get a hug?
- She go down?
- Yeah, she passed right out.
- How's he doing?
- He's upset.
And I don't blame him.
- It's weird she shows up like that.
- Yeah.
- And of course she's late, the druggie.
- Can you stop with the "druggie" thing?
- Please.
- What? She's a druggie.
I understand that.
- You're gonna talk to her, right?
- Yes, I intend to.
If you don't punch her first.
OK, that's her.
- It's not my fault if I punch her.
- You know what? It is.
That will be your fault.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Mike Flaherty. How are you?
- Come on in, please.
- Sorry, but my cab was late, so--
That's not a problem.
Not a problem. Come in.
This is my wife, Jackie.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Right.
- Uh, can I take your jacket?
- Oh, yeah.
- OK.
- Yes. Thank you.
- You have a really nice home.
- Thank you.
Do you wanna sit down?
- Thanks.
- Please.
So Kyle's downstairs
with Abby, our six-year-old.
- Oh, OK.
- Uh...
Can I get you a drink?
Uh, water or soda? Anything?
Oh... No, I'm... fine.
OK, uh, I'll go get Kyle.
Yeah. How's he doing?
Uh...
- Actually, he's doing very well.
- Extremely well.
Yes, he's going to the high school here.
And he's wrestling
on the team, actually.
- Oh. Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.
- He loves wrestling so much.
- I know.
Oh, he's a sweet kid.
Our girls love him.
Mmm...
That's nice. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to...
It's just been a really hard time
and everything.
- And I feel bad that...
- Oh. Come on.
Now, come on.
These things happen.
We loved having
him here. It's OK.
Hey, honey.
Uh...
This is Abby.
Abby, this is Kyle's mom.
- Hey, Abby.
- Hi.
Hey, kiddo, you think
you could go get Kyle for us?
- He left.
- He left? What do you mean?
He left out the window.
- I'm really sorry about this.
- It's OK. Thanks.
You know, Kyle is doing really well
with the wrestling here, Cindy.
Mmm.
He has the regions this weekend, and if
he wins there, he goes on to the states.
- That's great.
- It is, you know.
Could be a really good thing for him.
It might even mean
a scholarship. You know?
So I was wondering, actually,
if you wouldn't mind maybe staying
around another couple of weeks?
I don't think I can afford
to stay in the motel for that long.
Uh-huh.
Do you think maybe
we could stay in my dad's house?
Yeah, I think that we could
probably make that work. Yeah.
Yeah. Then, yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That's great. Great.
Sorry. Excuse me.
- Hey.
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Yeah, Kyle's over here.</i>
- Really?
Good, we found him.
Yeah, we're playing Wii Golf.
I'm destroying him.
Hey, not for nothing, dude,
but this kid really hates his mother.
- All right. Great, Terry. Thank you.
<i>- No, I'm serious.</i>
<i>- More than I hate my ex-wife.</i>
- OK, I got it, Terry. Great. Thank you.
- <i>Bye.</i>
- All right.
He went to my friend's house,
we can get him there.
Yeah, you know, I think, um, I probably
should just go back to the motel.
- It might be too much for him tonight.
- You sure?
Yeah, I think it's probably better.
I know how he can be.
It's hard, pal, I know. But she's
staying so you can finish the season.
That's pretty nice of her, you know?
I told her you'd go see her today.
- Where?
- You know, wherever you want.
Uh... You could see her here,
we could go see her at Leo's house.
She's moving in this morning.
All right.
I'll go see her at Leo's before
practice, but I wanna go alone.
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi, Betty.
- How's the foot?
- Fine.
Good.
Cindy's here.
- Really? Did she say why?
- No, but she's here with an attorney.
- Hey, Cindy. How you doing?
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi. Mike Flaherty.
- Eleanor Cohen.
- Great to meet you.
So nice to meet you.
Well, I didn't realize Cindy
was represented by counsel.
Oh, yeah,
she retained me last week...
...to, uh, help sort out the situation
with her father.
- OK. Uh, well, come on in.
- Well, thank you.
Yeah.
I thought, uh... I thought you said
you just got here two days ago, Cindy.
Uh...
Cindy wanted a little time to settle in
and spend some time with her father.
Sure, yeah. Um, so how can I help?
Cindy's decided to have a more
active role in her father's care.
Mm-hmm. Great.
What kind of role is that?
Um, I want to take care of him.
Really? Uh, do you wanna move here?
No. Cindy's decided to bring
her father back to Columbus.
That's where my
support network is now.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's home.
Um...
My only concern is that
that may not be what Leo wants.
Yeah, I already talked to him about it.
He seemed to like the idea.
I understand that, Cindy. But, uh...
...you know, you haven't
seen Leo in a long time,
and he's battling dementia now.
So it, uh, kind of puts me
in a tough position here, you know?
Yeah, I understand.
But seeing that she is the presumed
guardian, we hope to avoid litigation.
So do I. And I know
that we can. Absolutely.
We definitely can. Um...
Now, I'm sorry, but I actually
have to see another client.
- Oh.
- But we should set up another time...
- ...to talk about this, definitely, OK?
- Yes.
OK.
<i>- Is it that bad?
- Yeah, it's that bad.</i>
- Take her to court. You'll kill her.
- I can't.
What do you mean?
She's a mess, Mike.
You're a pillar
of the community.
I just can't go back in front of Judge
Lee. It'll look very bad. Trust me.
- I can't afford that right now, Terry.
- Well, then dump it.
Dump it. Just give her back Leo.
It sucks, but you got your
business to worry about, right?
- Yeah, I do. Maybe you're right.
- Incoming, dude.
- Mike.
- Hey, pal.
Do you know she wants
to take Leo back to Ohio?
Yeah, I know. She just told me today.
You're not gonna let
her do that, are you?
- I don't know, Kyle. It's complicated.
- What's complicated?
She doesn't give a shit about him.
You can't let her do that.
All right. Why don't you just go
get ready for practice, all right?
I'll deal with it.
Fine.
But I told her I'm staying
with you guys until I leave.
Stay focused, Kyle.
Wow.
- What's your play?
- Well, I have no f ricking idea.
She's looking
for a payout, dude.
- Just buy her stake, give her an exit.
- What does that mean?
Give her some of Leo's money and
send her home. He's not gonna miss it.
No, I can't do that.
She's not even in his...
That's right, she's not. And she
doesn't know it, and that's my play.
Wait, what's your play?
Uh...
Don't worry about it.
Can you get practice started?
- Really? Yeah.
- Good, go.
- Want me to slap you, get you psyched?
- No, I really don't.
<i>I know that we're all concerned
with what's best for Leo,</i>
<i>so I'm hoping that we can
settle this in an amicable way.</i>
- Well, so do we.
- Good.
Well, um, to that end,
I thought that I would lay
all the cards on the table...
...so that maybe you can understand
why I'm hesitating...
...in turning Leo over to Cindy.
OK.
OK. Um...
Cindy, your father disinherited
you from his will, completely.
I'm afraid that that can't change now
that he's been declared incapacitated.
What?
Is that true?
We'll have to see
a copy of the will, Mike.
Certainly. I, uh, brought you a copy.
- Thank you.
- You bet.
Then who did he leave it to? Kyle?
- No.
- Then who? You?
No, no.
He, uh, actually left it
to the municipal parks system.
He wanted the town park
dedicated in his name.
Oh, my God. He is such a scumbag.
- OK.
- Oh, my God. No.
He never cared about
a fucking thing except himself...
...and his goddamn fucking money!
- Cindy.
- Oh, my God!
- Don't do this.
- Oh, God, I can't believe this.
- Please.
- "Please" what? "Please"?
- I need to discuss this with my client.
- Understood.
What's to discuss?
I'm not taking care of him...
...if I'm not getting anything for it.
That's it.
- Stop it.
- No!
- Oh, my God.
- We're finished here, Mike.
Understand completely.
I'm gonna leave that with you.
Thank you.
- How did you not know this?
- Look. Calm down.
What the fuck
were you doing?
<i>- Brass balls, buddy. Brass balls.
- No.</i>
Yeah, and she's moved back
to the motel.
- Good.
- Yes, it is. I think it worked.
It totally worked.
They opened their kimono...
...and you made them eat the trade.
I don't know what you're
talking about half the time.
- Really?
- No, really.
It's time, Coach.
Hey, you ready?
He's ready.
Man...
This is exciting, huh?
You think there are scouts here?
Definitely. Wait till we get
to the states. Atlantic City?
- We're gonna have so much fun.
- Fierce.
Good luck, baby.
Lock up.
OK. Listen up, all right?
One more win
and we go to the states.
OK? That's all that matters,
that's all that counts.
Hey! Listen to me.
You stay in this, OK?
This is your place.
This is your place, you control it.
Remember? You control it!
Now, go get him! Finish it!
At 119,
we have Timmons, New Providence,
and Brown, Saddle Brook.
Ready to go
on the whistle, kid. Here we go.
OK, we're ready.
Good game, gentlemen.
- Stance.
- Come on, Kyle, you got this.
Head up! Head up! Head up!
- Kyle!
- That's a point, right?
- Yo, what do you got?
- Unsportsmanlike conduct.
- Kyle! Control. Settle down.
- One point, red.
- Just settle down, OK?
- Let's go, Chris!
- Sprawl!
- Sprawl, Kyle! Sprawl!
- Foot's on the mat.
- On the mat. On the mat.
Settle down.
No, that's it. Over. Over.
How you doing?
I'm sorry.
Hey. It's all right, man.
It's all right.
I don't wanna
go with her, Mike.
<i>L</i> don't.
OK, pal.
OK.
Hey, buddy. Heads up.
Take them to the car, would you?
I'll be right there.
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see my son wrestle.
Yeah, well, your son had a pretty good
chance to do something special in there.
Maybe even change his life.
And that's gone now,
<i>so</i> I hope you're happy.
- That's not my fault.
- It isn't?
Why do you think he lost his shit
in there today, huh?
- What do you want?
- I want my father.
It didn't sound like that the other day.
It sounded like you hated the guy.
You have no idea what my father
used to be like.
He was different.
He treated me like shit.
So you're gonna return
the favor, is that it?
I want that commission!
- That's supposed to be mine!
- Is that what this is about?
- Fifteen hundred dollars? My God.
- Isn't that why you took him?
OK. You know what?
I'll tell you what.
You want the commission?
Fine, I will let you have it.
And you don't even have to take Leo.
I will take care of him for free, and I
will send you the check every month.
- On one condition.
- What's that?
That you leave Kyle here with us
until he finishes high school.
I'm his mother. He belongs with me.
- You sure he feels that way?
- Don't you tell me what my son feels.
He's coming with me, and there isn't
anything you can do about that.
Fine. Then you can't
have that commission.
- Oh, well, we'll see about that!
- Yeah, we will.
I want to see my son!
Give him a call. You got his number.
We were right there, Mike.
Right fucking there.
Now we got nothing.
Are you OK?
No.
Mike. Your mom's here.
Dinner's almost ready.
- You seen Kyle?
- He's not in the basement?
- No.
- Oh, for chrissake.
- I'll find him.
- Thanks, Terry.
- What a day, huh?
- Yeah, right.
You OK?
What are we gonna do?
There's nothing to do.
I can't stop her.
She's gonna leave
and take Leo and Kyle with her.
You don't think
you can beat her in court?
No, I don't. Nope.
Well, isn't it obvious
she just wants him for the money?
I just can't win this one, Jack.
Trust me.
I do.
Hey, Kyle. Honey, come in.
I'm so glad you came.
Have a seat, honey.
You want a soda or something?
What do you want?
I just wanted to say
how sorry I was about the match.
Is that why you called?
Just to tell me that?
No.
I also wanted to say that...
...I'll do whatever you think
is best for Leo. I promise.
Then leave him here,
where he is.
I have to tell you, I'm not sure
that's what Leo wants.
Here.
- Just read the parts in yellow.
- What is it?
It's the transcript
from when Leo was in court.
My lawyer got it for me.
This isn't real. The judge
told Leo he had to live there.
No. No, honey.
This is official, from the court.
That's what Mike said.
He gets paid for being
Leo's guardian, Kyle.
And then he just put him in that place
so he wouldn't have to deal with him.
- Leo belongs with us.
- Why?
Because we deserve that money,
Kyle. Not some lawyer.
You're a big boy.
You can understand that.
Look, Kyle, honey--
Shut up. Just shut up.
I don't care about any of this.
Just leave Leo alone!
Do you hear me?
Do you?
Thanks, Karen. I appreciate it.
Yeah, bye.
- Anything?
- No, he's not at Stemler's.
- This is crazy. Where could he be?
- I don't know.
- He's upset. Maybe he went for a walk.
- We should take a drive.
Your mom can stay with the kids.
Where are we gonna go?
Hold on.
Yes? Hello?
- Yeah, this is him.
- Who is it?
What?
It has been a very long day.
I need some answers.
Uh, now, if you can't give them to me,
get me somebody who can.
- Now.
- Sir, please stay calm.
- We're doing our best.
- Stay calm? You've lost my ward.
- Calm down.
- We'll find him.
- "Calm down"?
- We're gonna sue your ass.
- He's a lawyer.
- I'm sorry.
How could you
just let him escape?
Look, he's definitely
not on the premises.
A lot of the time,
they just try to go home.
- We're about to go there now.
- Unbelievable. Unbelievable.
Hey, folks,
keep an eye on each other.
Terry.
- The lights are on.
- It's gotta be him.
- Hey, did you bring the key?
- No, I forgot it.
Shit.
- Shh! Terry!
- My bad, my bad, my bad.
- Ring the bell.
- I just did, sweetheart, OK?
- I think I hear a TV.
- Really?
You're right. OK.
Um...
Hold on, hold on.
Hold on.
- Yes, there he is.
- What's he doing?
He's watching TV.
Leo.
Leo.
Leo.
He's not responding. Hit the bell.
- Anything?
- Nothing.
- Dude, is he dead?
- I have no f ricking idea.
- Christ.
- Dude, this is kind of spooky.
- Should we just break in?
- No.
Uh... OK. I've got a key back
at the office. I'll go get it.
- You guys stay here.
- Alone?
- Hey.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Come on in.
- Super spooky.
- You go first.
- Oh, for God's sake.
- I'll go last.
You OK, Leo?
How'd you get here, pal?
Leo, did you walk here?
I brought him here.
Kyle!
- You brought him?
- Yeah.
Are you out of your mind?
We've been worried sick about him.
- About both of you.
- You didn't have to worry about us.
Really creepy. Just saying.
Kyle.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Making spaghetti.
- Jesus, have you lost your mind?
- No.
Kyle, you can't just
take him out of the home.
- This is where he belongs.
- Honey, he needs to be at Oak Knoll.
- We talked about this.
- Yeah, we did.
I remember.
Listen to this.
"Mr. Poplar wants to live at home."
You can do that, Mike?
- "Yes, I can. Really."
- What? What is this? What?
It's true, isn't it?
Mike?
What is this?
You're just like her.
- Mike.
- Kyle. Kyle!
Hey, Kyle. Wait a minute.
Will you hold on a second?
- Don't touch me!
- Shit.
- I'm sorry, come on.
- I said, don't touch me!
Jesus. OK.
- Let me explain, OK?
- Explain what?
How you lied to me?
How you lied to Leo?
- No, that's not how it was, OK?
- Then how was it, Mike? Tell me.
Calm down. All right?
Come on, man.
- Calm down.
- Mike, watch the head fake.
I'm not gonna wrestle with you.
- Hands up, hands up.
- Stop it, OK?
- Don't egg him on.
- That's not helping.
- It is. This kid's a good wrestler.
- Calm down.
- You see, I told you.
- Stop it!
- OK, buddy, get to your base. Good.
- Stop!
- Mike, stop it!
- OK, buddy.
- I'm trying to stop it!
- Sit out, Mike! Sit out!
Would you stop coaching
and break it up? Break it up!
- Get off me!
- All right.
- Kyle. Kyle.
- Kyle!
Come on, get up. It's OK.
I... No, no, no.
I'm just the ref. I'm just the ref!
Just the ref!
Kyle!
- Come on!
- Kyle!
Kyle!
Is this true, Mike?
Did you say this to the judge?
Yeah, I did.
So then why did you move him
if he wanted to stay here?
Because it would have been
too much work to leave him here.
OK? I couldn't handle it.
- Then you shouldn't have taken him.
- I had to do it, all right?
- Why?
- Because I needed the money. OK?
We need the money.
So you took some old man
out of his home to make money off him?
- Are you out of your freaking mind?
- No. No!
I did not think that it would
get this complicated, OK?
Really? Or you just didn't think
you'd get caught?
- Jack, where you going?
- Home!
<i>Incoming call. Do you copy?</i>
<i>Incoming call. Charlie Squadron taking
heavy fire. Requesting air strike Bravo.</i>
<i>Do you copy?
Delta Squad, disengage target.</i>
Hello?
Hello, Mom?
Hello?
- Did your mom just crank call you?
- No.
So did you and coach get
into a fight because you lost?
No, we got in a fight
because he's an asshole.
- Really?
- Yeah, really, Stem.
Well, I'm sure he'll
make it up to you, bro.
You're the best wrestler he's ever had.
I mean, he's always been cool
to me, and I suck.
- Hi, Leo.
- Hey.
- I fell asleep.
- I'm sorry.
Sorry for what?
Wanna go home, Leo?
Yes. I'd like that.
Hi.
Hi.
- Where's Kyle?
- He slept at Stemler's.
- You?
- Uh, Oak Knoll.
So what are you gonna do?
I have to go to court.
No, you can't. You told the judge
you were keeping Leo at home.
I know.
Well, then tell her you changed your
mind and he needs to be in a home.
No one could argue with that.
I can't do that.
- Why not?
- Because it's not true.
Oh, well, I'm glad
you're done lying now.
Just in time to lose your practice.
That's how your family survives.
Did you ever think of that, Mike?
Yeah, all the time.
Shit.
I'm sorry, Jack.
I really am.
I know.
Hey, pal. How'd
you get down here?
- The window.
- You hungry? I'm making pancakes.
I'm leaving.
I just came to get my shit.
- Right now?
- Yeah.
Hey, Kyle.
Listen, I just wanna say I'm sorry.
I know, Mike, you're sorry.
Everyone's always sorry.
I'm moving Leo back home, Kyle,
and I'm gonna fight
to make sure that he stays there.
- It's too late, you'll lose.
- My mother's gonna take him.
Maybe, but I'm still gonna try.
So what? You want me to forgive
you now, is that it, Mike?
No, I just want you
to give me another chance.
This is bullshit!
- Hey, Kyle, listen--
I want to be alone.
- What?
- I just wanna be down here alone.
OK. All right. Yeah.
Kyle, I just wanna say we love you.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.
Hey, Mr. Poplar.
Good to see you.
- Jackie.
- Hey.
- How's it going?
- What are you doing here?
Dude, I'm your assistant coach.
- Just notice who isn't here.
- Aha.
Ah. Hey, Mike?
Hey, Eleanor.
Can I talk to you?
Uh... sure. Hold on, OK?
You know the transcript alone
is enough to hang you.
Yeah, well,
we'll see what happens.
Shame on you, Counselor.
Is that it?
No, my client
would like to talk to you.
Hi.
Is your deal still available?
What about Kyle?
He can stay.
Then, yes, it is.
And you'll send me the checks?
Every month.
You take good care of him?
We will.
I wanna say goodbye.
OK.
Kyle, come here for a minute.
Your mom wants to
talk to you for a minute.
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.
Not bad, not bad.
Check this out.
All right.
- Nice, dude.
- This mallet's crap.
Hey, guys.
- Hi, Daddy. I'm winning.
- That's great, sweetheart.
- What up, Coach?
- Hey, Stemler.
Kyle, can you move those garbage
cans around the side of the house?
- All right.
- Thanks, pal.
- I'm switching colors.
- Why?
Not feeling
the orange, bro.
- Hey, honey.
- Hey. How was work?
Good. I got stuck at the office
with a client.
I know, Shelly called.
- I dropped off the fan at Leo's today.
- Thanks for doing that.
- I'll be right back down.
- You got time to eat?
- Uh, I'll eat there.
- All right, make sure you do.
Hey, barkeep.
I will take a banana daiquiri, please.
All right. Would you like
an umbrella with that?
No, thank you,
but keep those coming.
OK.
- So how you doing, pal?
- Me?
I'm Pretty good.

<i>â™ª Think you can wait? â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been runnin' a sleepless run â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Been away from the baby way too long â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been holdin' a good-night gun â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been losin' our exits one by one â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'm out of my mind â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Think you can wait? â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'm way off the line â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Think you can wait it out? â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª All I have â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Is all â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Think you can wait it out? â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª All I have â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Is all â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Think you can wait? â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª What I'm thinkin' is simple â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'll sell apples
and ice water at the temple â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª And I won't make trouble â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'll pull the devil down with me
one way or another â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been runnin' a sleepless run â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª Been away from the baby way too long â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been holdin' a good-night gun â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª We've been losin' our exits one by one â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'll try â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª I'll try â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª But I couldn't be better â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª All I have â™ª</i>
<i>- â™ª Is all â™ª</i>
<i>- â™ª I'll try â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª But I couldn't be better â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª All I have â™ª</i>
<i>- â™ª Is all â™ª</i>
<i>- â™ª I'll try â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª But I couldn't be better â™ª</i>
<i>â™ª All I have â™ª</i>
