Yes?
We received some very
unusual data today.
- Military division?
- Harbinger 1 training facility.
- Which model?
- S.A.R.
There's been a reprogram count,
one and a half million just under one day.
That is a high number.
It's unprecedented.
Well, in that case, Mills.
Congratulations.
Drifter. Report.
The other are out on the strip.
And it's shitty.
See you out there.
Hey. Winder.
- What's this all about?
- I'm not the guy you should be asking.
We've been on training
the last 4 times out.
It's 2 days.
They're looking for marines
with combat time.
Not many of those left.
I thought we were pushing
to finish it.
With drones.
With more than enough men sitting it out...
You know no one is sitting it out
over there because we are all here.
Harbinger right?
If it were me,
I take a look around,
think about the money,
not where it's coming from...
and get on the transport.
Wait.
You've been assigned a Tech.
Captain Bukes. Katherine Mills.
What do you want?
We have hardware in the field
where we would be testing.
- I'm from Harbinger, I'll be observing.
- Yeah?
- Keeping an eye on us.
- Yes, and the hardware.
Are you trying to work out
what you can save on?
No, no. That's no what we do.
We're vendors for the US military.
We're not the US military.
If you don't keep up, we'll leave
you where you passed out.
And turn that shit off.
I don't want to be scanned
at anytime, is that clear?
This doesn't go off.
- Captain?
- We're Oscar miking, Mills.
Fall in or stay here.
Is she with us?
Looks that way.
How long do you think till
we see one of them in uniform?
By then we won't be.
Here.
See if you can understand it.
Excuse me.
We're all back together.
Corporal Loftus? Mills.
How the fuck did she
even know my name?
Did you just look me up?
Fucking techer.
Officer on deck.
9 letters down,
"Brought to an end."
Go to sleep.
How many more klicks?
Jeez, boy. What is it??
You need to take a shit of something.
Give me 5 seconds
with this motherfucker.
This is an exercise.
We don't know where we're going.
Even my wife doesn't know
where we're going.
I thought Cutbill was your wife.
You like that.
I do love my mute little war prince.
Yes, ma'am. It means a lot.
Hey. Do you know my name?
Lance corporal Martin Goodwin.
You do know your name
is on your front.
Don't you, Goodwin?
But it don't say the first name.
Lance corporal Martin Goodwin.
Address 23T81 Centre Street,
Conway, Arkansas.
Home with mother, Alice Goodwin.
Father, Clint, deceased.
Medical records indicated...
Would you like me to stop
the children from bothering you, Mills?
Watch it, Sarge.
You got to choose your friends carefully.
This one might be able to find out
how much porn you are downloading.
It would take more than one person
to calculate that shit, let me tell you.
It's "Concluded".
Thank you.
Hey. Mills.
I see you.
I can also fire from here
while you are checking the chamber.
Alright.
Check your field pads,
move on these coordinates.
Ammos live. Check your targets.
Goodwin, you hear me? Live ammo.
Yes, sir.
We will be monitored.
Oscar mike in 5 minutes.
Let's go.
It's show time.
Guess who's getting the first robot?
What she's got, is another tool.
Like these.
Do those go into your brain?
Goodwin.
Get that stuff out of the way.
Yes, sir.
- Captain Bukes.
- Wait a moment, please.
Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility.
Exercise is now on.
Welcome to Harbinger One Training Facility.
Exercise is now on.
Sarge. Who's monitoring us?
- There's no one here.
- I'm watching you.
You better bet there's no body here.
Sir. What do you want us to do?
Let's get on with it.
We're Oscar mike.
- Sir!
- Yes, sir.
- Captain, do you have ground support?
- No.
No unmanned ground recon
what so ever?
Problem?
- No, no. I just thought...
- Good.
I'm sorry, Captain, I think
we got off on the wrong foot.
I don't think so, Mills.
2 days.
This place got a serious
decorating problem.
Home sweet home.
- Yo, Hackett.
- Yeah?
You decorated this place, right?
I took inspiration from
your apartment, dipshit.
- Is this whole thing going to be inside?
- Shut up and keep moving, Cherry.
Alright.
- Cutbill, eyes up.
- Yes, sir.
We're here to train.
But, that doesn't mean
we should let our guard down.
Eyes up.
Robinson, walk and point.
Goodwin, with me.
- Okay.
- Okay, spread out.
No gaggle fuck, please, ladies.
Let's move!
Nothing up front.
We're all clear for about a click.
Goodwin, hang in there for a second.
Hackett, Loftus, Cutbill.
Move wide, check the flanks.
Drifter?
I got it.
I understand that you
are a Supertech, Mills.
You don't need to
do all this humping shit.
Help me out, with my boss.
We're all a bunch of cavemen?
Not all of you, Sergeant.
Good. I like that.
I got your six.
Whoa.
Mills?
No, no, no, no. Wait a minute.
This is Drifter.
We picked up some surveillance.
Same here.
Someone's got a new toy.
- Harbinger make this?
- Yes.
But, this one has been modified.
It's Quantum robotics.
There's no operator.
Quantum.
One and naught and everything between.
Yes, that's right.
I read.
It doesn't mean I understand
what I am reading.
It's autonomous.
All that power to get it to follow
Goodwin's dumb-ass through the forest.
So, you high up in Harbinger?
Yes.
Can I get a job?
I just lost mine.
I know.
At least they know we're here.
Let's keep moving.
Mills, game time.
Let's go!
Take a look.
What do we got this time?
What does it look like?
They look fucking ridiculous.
Listen up.
9 robot targets to the north.
- Close to the river, maybe more.
- Are you kidding me, man?
Let's get this done, right?
Goodwin, Hackett, with me.
Everyone else, on the ridge.
We're are gonna get some...
Goodwin, you just stay with me.
- Drifter.
- Yes, sir.
Alright, everyone. Switch on.
Let's move.
Mills?
Care to join me?
Ready.
Ready.
Set.
- Goodwin, you watch me.
- Yes, sir.
Reaper 1 in position, standby.
Firing in 5.
5.
4.
3.
2.
1.
Fire.
You getting all this?
You like that?
Look at you.
And that concludes our day.
Well done, team.
Let's set up camp, dig a ditch
get in early.
Where are you, Mills?
Man, I hope you keep your job.
The world is no place for you.
There's no place for you
because they don't fit you.
- Too damn big, Robinson.
- Too damn big, brother.
Too damn big.
So, I say where?
"Where's the target?"
He says, "Down there."
" Goodwin."
I'm actually thinking,
"Should I smoke the little fucker."
We don't want to shoot you, Cherry.
We love you.
If you don't shave that ass hair off
your face, I might shoot you myself.
Seriously, dude, get a razor.
Is it true, you guys are really...
- What? You think she's a fox?
- Damn, you little pervert.
I think she's... interesting.
- She's not even human, man.
- Alright.
5 letters, "Most inferior".
Anybody?
- Goodwin.
- That's not five.
Yeah, but it is fucking true.
Damn, did you see
those things up close?
Honestly, they are rolling into each other.
It's embarrassing, man.
I have seen more advance juicers.
Mills.
Coffee?
So.
Where did you get to today?
I had a look around.
We still can't reach anyone.
You had any luck?
You know, with your...
The network here is local.
There's something blocking our
transmissions but I don't know what.
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of it.
Right.
Why doesn't Bukes ask me himself?
Bukes, he's...
He's a little shy.
- Shy?
- Yeah.
Especially around cute girls.
Or maybe he just chooses
not to like you.
With his record,
that's unfortunate for me.
You pulled his file?
Drifter, I pulled everyone's file.
How many does it say?
It says 18.
Just the figures, no context, right?
That's why he doesn't
want to like you.
Those figures may be hard to swallow,
but that's the job.
And we are good at our jobs.
So, how old were you
when you were chipped?
I was 11.
Without it?
Paralysis.
You have to wait until
you are old enough.
Harbinger sponsored that?
Yeah. Cured it.
I thought I was institutionalized.
You have no idea.
You can keep staring but
it won't make her disappear.
Did she say anything to you?
She says we're being blocked,
that's why there's no comms.
She doesn't know why.
She knows.
I don't think so.
Incredibly, she really seems
to be as clueless as us.
All the gear. No idea.
Something's off.
With the training?
With Mills?
Both.
- Sir.
- Sir.
What makes you so sure
that she's the problem?
I have never been cut off before.
Can't reach anyone at TAC.
Can't reach home at all.
And there she is, with a radio
in her head saying nothing.
What the hell do you want?
Get out of here!
- What the fuck is going on here?
- I don't know.
- Was that your weapon?
- No.
Who the fuck is firing, man?
I don't know, man.
I just heard the firing.
Alright, Cutbill, fall back.
Goodwin, go with Loftus.
Why do you keep asking me?
I told you, I don't know!
What happened?
Sir, I looked up and saw
Loftus stood right there,
and the next second he was gone.
Well, this is just
part of the training, right?
I see him. Over there!
Robinson, Hackett, follow me!
Slow down, Cutbill!
Slow down!
It's him.
What is this?
Can you hear me, buddy?
- Sam?
- Alright, move back.
- Sergeant, what the hell is going on here?
- Sam.
- What is going on here?
- Shut up! Cutbill!
- Sam, talk to me.
- Enough!
- Come on, man.
- You think that's going to help him?
Look at me. Shut up.
- Should we take it off?
- Those lines, they're...
Those cuts are straight.
It's like...
- Captain, let's get out of here.
- Help me with him.
- No, let's get out of here.
- Help me with him!
Cutbill, shut up!
Mills, what's going on?
This is your target area from yesterday.
What?
Sir, we got to get him
out of here as soon...
Move!
Mills.
Those were our positions.
Robinson, cover me!
Keep moving!
Captain, do you copy? Over.
We got to get somewhere
where we can get eyes on.
I can't get a good shot from here.
Captain?
Captain, do you read me? Copy.
Anyone, this is Cutbill,
do you read me?
Let me go. Let me go.
Let me go. Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Let me go.
Please, don't!
What the fuck is this?
Please don't!
Did you see them?
Not clearly.
I saw a couple of them,
took a shot.
They must have pretty good armour,
because I hit them hard.
- Like the ones from yesterday?
- No, they're bigger. They're our height.
My Marines are dying.
So, you tell me what you know.
You saw them on that ridge.
I'm connected to the network,
So, I see them, yes.
- You do see them.
- Yes.
So, turn the fucking things off,
right now.
- I can't.
- You can't?
Well, you don't seem to have a problem
turning everything else on and off.
I can't just turn them off.
There must be a reason.
Programming errors.
I'm running the possibilities.
Look.
This is not a fucking equation.
You just get a hold of
some one right now.
- You get us out of here.
- Okay.
- Or you're going to be the next one getting shot.
- Not like this.
She doesn't know, alright?
- Some programmer screwed up somewhere.
- No. No.
Screw ups aren't so efficient.
I can't find him.
But I found this.
Not too far from here.
We need to find him, sir.
Goodwin, you got rear point.
- Okay, I'm listening.
- She's useful.
We can't see them on the field pads,
we can't see them through the trees.
But, Mills sees them.
Does it occur to you that
If she sees them,
and they see her and us.
It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter?
- No.
Because I'm telling your right now,
we need all the help that we can get.
Did you see the groupings on Hackett?
They hit her 3 times.
The 3rd time while she was
spinning through the fucking air.
I've been thinking about that,
because that's all that I'm thinking about.
They had us.
And they let us walk. Why?
Let us walk? What about Cutbill?
Now, they could have
finished everyone of us.
But, while she was there,
they held back.
It's not about her. Or you.
Bukes.
The used them for target practice.
Like Loftus.
We're being track from the ridge.
Move!
Hold on.
- Where's Bukes?
- I lost track of him.
This is Drifter, anyone copy?
Come on.
Let's keep moving.
Goodwin! Move!
Bukes, come in, copy.
Solid copy, Drifter.
Who's with you?
I got Goodwin and Robinson. We are
north about a click from the camp.
Good.
Mills is down.
But I found a place to hole up.
- We'll come find you.
- No.
You won't find your way
through the dark.
They'll have no problem picking you off.
Stay put.
We'll regroup as soon
as the light is better.
Over.
- Bukes, copy.
- Copy.
We need her. Copy.
See you tomorrow. Over.
How long was I out?
9 hours.
Drink this.
Why didn't you leave me?
I don't know.
I'm still thinking about it.
While you were out of it,
One of those machines
shows up here and...
The two of you had a moment
or something.
We need to find it.
Why?
I can't explain it.
Find a way.
Let's go.
It's good to see you, man.
You too.
Everyone in one piece?
Yeah.
They didn't try for us.
They could have.
As far as I can make out,
they were everywhere last night.
Mills?
Yeah, it looks clear ahead.
All their signals are behind us.
Let's get back to the drop zone.
And wait till someone
sends us a transport.
Let's be ready this time.
Stay low, Mills.
He'll need me for the door.
I'll be fine.
Bukes?
Take Mills to the door.
We need her to get in.
Alright. Copy.
Take it easy down there, Mills.
We need your eyes.
Clear.
Come on.
- Do you want me to handle this?
- Wait here.
- Captain Damien Bukes.
- Wait a moment, please.
Wait a moment, please.
Wait a moment, please.
Surveillance drones.
Mills.
- Get the door.
- Okay.
Come on. Come on.
What happens if they can't
get through the door?
Smoke.
They are using smoke.
They're fucking copying us.
Drifter?
I can't see a thing.
Goodwin. Move!
Robinson. Move!
Got it.
Drifter, the door is open.
Get him out of here, now!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Drifter, let's go!
Drifter! No!
Drifter!
Don't let it cut me up!
Bukes, I can stop this!
Wait!
Damn it, Robinson!
Don't let it cut me up!
- Do it!
- No wait!
No!
No!
Let's go, Mills. Now!
I could have saved him.
- No one could have saved him.
- Yes, I could. I could have saved him.
No way you could have saved him.
Why didn't you wait. I
was telling you to wait.
- There's no way.
- Yes, I could.
- Why...
- I made them!
This shit no make no sense.
Why are we here, Mills?
I don't know.
Marines come here to train.
I don't know why you're here,
I only know that you were requested.
And you?
Why are you here?
I write the program,
design the prototypes.
This is where they are tested.
Have you had a good look
at what you've done?
- What you've created.
- Nothing like this has ever happened before.
The codes have advanced more
than we ever could have imagined.
But, if I can understand it,
I can try to control it.
It's a little late for that,
don't you think?
- No, you don't understand.
- Open your eyes, Mills.
They are killers.
That's all they are.
She stood in the middle of that road,
and not one of them took a shoot.
That's because they are trying to
work out if I'm one of them or not.
Yeah.
So were we.
What are they?
They're your replacements.
Replacements?
They're called S.A.R.
Study. Analyse. Reprogram.
They learn.
Given enough to learn from,
then, they improve themselves.
Like us.
We created them to save lives,
and they will.
Whose lives are they going to save?
Cutbill's.
Hackett, Drifter?
We built them so people like you
don't have to die or kill anyone.
That's not up to you.
It's up to me.
And how has that
worked out so far?
I live with it.
So people like you won't have to.
But, you kill us.
And you know it.
Watch her.
Half an hour and
they'll roll us out the back.
Do we fight them off here
and wait for the transport?
We won't last that long.
We need to find
a better defensive position.
There's another door.
Well, that would be you, Mills.
Wait a second.
How do we know this door
doesn't just lead right back outside.
Do you want to stay here, Goodwin?
We don't have a choice. Open it.
I can't see a thing.
Motherfucker.
Did you turn the lights on?
Don't turn anything else on.
Are you alright?
No, man.
I fucking hate this place.
This is where they test them?
Unbelievable.
You should have stop
when you made these.
Lock the door.
Open this one.
Goodwin, keep with us.
Copy.
Mills, you have to stay with me.
Mills!
Well, this just gets
better and better.
I can't communicate out,
even from in here.
It's a bottleneck.
- We can slow them down from here.
- Charges?
- Yeah.
- Goodwin.
- How many have we got?
- We got about 5.
- 5.
- Yeah.
That's all we got, Cap.
What's you scanning for?
Captain!
Mills?
Mills!
Mills.
Whatever you're thinking...
They have power.
I'm going to activate one.
They share information.
That's why they are so well organize.
When it comes online,
I'll know everything they know.
I can get to them
through this one.
Are you fully operational?
Command to Speech mode.
Speech mode activated.
What are S.A.R general orders?
Running human combat program.
Study. Analyse. Reprogram.
Okay. Come on.
Unable to comply.
There is an human error.
Detail human error.
Human training subjects
not performing as expected.
Subjects require motivation.
Training now with live ammunition.
And to new human training subjects.

My god.
Did Guardian S.A.R unit order
Reaper 5 unit into training?
Did you bring these marines here?
Yes.
When will the training program be complete?
Completion unspecified.
Mills, open the door now!
No, I have to try.
Come on.

- Remain stationary.
- Mills, open the god damn door.
No, no. Leave me,
the others are coming through.
- Open the door, Mills!
- No, it's too late!
They're coming in, Captain.
We got to move!
Not yet.
Goodwin!
I'm sorry, I had to try.
Do you think we got him?
One.
Maybe.
Jesus!
Does anyone have any idea
where we are?
Anybody?
Any idea at all?
Mills.
How long have we got?
I don't see them,
they moved away.
Good.
Looks like some kind of training.
Looks like...
they ran out of these.
They moved over to the real thing.
One.
Two.
That's all.
Last one.
Great.
If you need me,
I'll be in my office.
Let me go. Let me go.
Don't let it cut me up!
You ready, Cherry?
Me neither.
You see any yet?
No.
Are we moving?
No.
So this is it.
What is that?
It's an EMP.
When you hit that S.A.R in the tunnel,
it detonated one of them.
It sends out a pulse that wipes
anything with a current near by.
We put them in each of them so
the enemy can't steal our technology.
But, it's range is short.
I've amped this one up.
All we need now is a detonator.
There is a leader, the one
who is responsible for all this.
The S.A.R codes that's
expanding in that one.
That's the one I need
to be with when I detonate.
I think that will stop it,
before it goes any further.
Do you know why they
haven't killed us yet, Bukes?
Because they have been pushing us, here.
They'll give you enough time to set up
and then they will come for you.
But, maybe I can end this.
By killing yourself?
Even if you survive the blast,
it will wipe you clean.
At this point,
we have no other option.
I'll have a small amount of time,
and then, my chip will shut down.
You can deal with whatever is left.
No.
Do you understand what I've done?
Look at this place.
We can't win this.
Hey, Robinson.
What's up, son?
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
You just figured that out now, Goodwin?
Robinson.
Multiple markers to the south.
Copy that.
Draw them in.
Goodwin, we got eyes on us.
Stay out of sight, over.
Copy that.
How many?
All of them.
Goodwin, they are in the streets,
east and west. Standby.
Please, god. Please, god.
Goodwin, hit it.
They lost a few.
I got something...
Robinson, 2 broken free from
the main group. Coming in fast.
That's one more down.
Maker on it's way from the west.
I've got him.
I'm going to fire.
Goodwin, keep your head down.
Robinson, on me.
Robinson!
- That's another one.
- Bukes, there's one right on you.
Goodwin, hit south.
Mills, where are the rest of them?
Goodwin, they see you.
Captain, I just got made!
I got to move!
Robinson. Cover me.
Goodwin, don't bail.
Captain! Captain!
Shit!
Get it off me!
Get it the fuck off me!
Captain...
The detonator.
I dropped the detonator.
Bukes, get behind me.
I don't know how long
this is going to work.
You can't be here, Mills.
You got to go. Just run.
No, this is it.
Hang in there, Mills.
Go. Move! Move!
Robinson.
Robinson.
Well, come on.
Well, come on!
You wanted this!
Just fucking do it.
I have received my orders.
Come on, finish it!
More data is required.
Mills! Mills!
More data is required to
complete training combat program.
You are not identified.
You are not identified.
Identify.
Identify.
Human.
Mills?
Hey!
We're getting out of here.
