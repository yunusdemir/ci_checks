What's goin' on here?
Sit down.
Work an hour, do an errand...
drive a car.
Is it dangerous?
It shouldn't be.
If anyone shoots, you're on your own.
Quit, run, do what you want.
Money. What's in it for me?
Fifty thousand. Maybe more.
But 50, anyhow...
in monthly installments,
so no quick spending.
- How do I know I'll get-
- You don't.
In a hurry? Gonna worry?
Quit. Get out. Now.
- In or out?
- I'm in.
Good. Go celebrate.
- Buy a car.
- I don't-
You do now.
Station wagon,
a Ford station wagon.
The big one,
the one with the wood on the side.
Thanks.
And no trips.
Just your selling.
It may be months, but, Erwin...
you come when I call.
No questions.
What you don't know can't hurt you.
You or me...
Erwin boy.
Bye-bye.
- Ty, is the check certified?
- I think it's all in order.
Tommy, you just sign there
on the top line.
I'll take your acknowledgment.
- Yes, that seems to be in order.
- The Mercantile account.
Well, I guess we bought
ourselves a property.
A Tommy Crown property.
It's always been very good to me.
You know the first thing I'm gonna do?
Goose up all the rents.
Aren't you gonna wish us luck,
Mr. Crown?
You overpaid.
Mr. Crown wishes you good luck.
Carol, have legal simplify
these mutual accounts, huh?
- I can't even read it myself.
- Yes, sir.
Sandy, you and Basil
handle the Goddard account.
He's got a bee in it for me.
Oh, cancel the insurance.
- Take my name off that building.
- See you, Tommy.
Mr. Crown, we're up 3.7%
on the principal accounts
of all five portfolios.
That's plus all
the trading gains.
That's not bad,
since the first of May.
Very good, Walter.
Oh, Walter, why don't you
take a shot at this mutual account?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Crown, it's Geneva again.
They've repeated the offer.
They're down a full half point
on that block of French francs.
- If you want to take-
- We'll wait.
Three more days.
Pan American Flight 863
for London
now boarding at Gate 52.
At the tone.
the time will be...
3:00...
and ten seconds.
- Yes, sir?
- No calls, no exceptions.
Tell 'em I've left for the day.
Book me Thursday to Geneva.
Cable to Richemond,
have Georges meet me at the airport.
Thursday, Georges, Richemond.
Got it.
Hello, Charlie?
How are you, boy?
All clear. Ten after 3:00.
Check in again at 3:40.
Bye-bye, Charlie.
...and 50 seconds.
At the tone.
the time will be...
3:17...
exactly.
At the tone.
the time will be...
3:17...
and ten seconds.
At the tone.
the time will be...
3:17...
and 20 seconds.
Hello, Charlie?
Yeah. One's out of order.
I've got all the numbers.
Steady.
Steady, boy.
It's 3:30, so wait.
I'll be here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Go.
I'm on my way.
Go.
Go.
Go.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Six, please.
Floors, please?
- Six.
- Ten, please.
Four out.
Don't touch the button.
Shut up!
On the floor.
Everybody on the floor.
- How you doin', chief?
- Okay, baby.
Okay.
Okay, now...
I want everybody
to stay real quiet
'cause we're gonna be here
just a little while, okay?
Okay.
Could you please give a message
to Joe Meagher?
- Meagher?
- Yeah, Joe Meagher.
M- E-A-G-H-E-R.
Hold it.
I think he's in General Settlement.
- Who shall I say is calling?
- Horan. Michael Horan.
Show me your feet.
Keep your hands on that book.
Now just stand there
and turn the pages.
In a minute you're gonna
walk past me, in front of me,
and down that corridor.
Where's the elevator?
We're gonna miss our coffee.
Get your hand back on that book!
Keep turnin' those pages.
Don't move.
Everybody over by the wall.
Now.
All right.
Sit down and shut up.
Sit!
Just keep movin',
nice and easy.
Come on.
- Keep walkin'.
- Hold it, sweetheart.
- What are you doing?
- Quiet.
- I don't want any trouble.
- Careful with that thing.
That could've been your head!
In the elevator, sweetheart,
with the rest of them.
Stay just the way you are.
Don't move.
And keep your head down!
Move.
Let's keep it quiet now.
Folks, let's keep it quiet.
Folks, keep it quiet.
We'll ask you a few questions, take your
name and address, and you can go home.
- Marvin, state police call in yet?
- Not that I know of.
Then you call them. And let me know
when the Bureau checks in.
And, Marvin, we're lookin' for suitcases,
cartons, anything that'll hold money.
- Bill, check the airport and trains.
- Right, Lieutenant.
Marcie, get me
the Turnpike Authority.
Calm down, Eddy.
I'll get 'em for you.
Did you have
a good afternoon, sir?
Fine. Just fine.
- Any calls?
- They're by your phone, sir.
I won't be needing you
tonight, John.
Thank you, sir.
Get it on tape-
all the details, every little thing.
Right.
Give 'em time to think.
Don't make 'em hurry.
Phil, better play waiter.
Go out there and tell them that we're
gonna buy them dinner, two bucks a head.
Send for it now. Keep it simple.
Paper plates, lots of napkins.
Marcie, give Phil
a pencil and pad.
Now, Mr. Wexler, what about
the numbers on those bills?
No numbers.
Just small bills.
- Did he have anything to say to you?
- He said to get in the elevator.
He put a gun in my face.
You know, I was really scared.
- He was an ordinary-looking businessman.
- What do you want?
- Huh?
- What do you want to eat?
Chicken salad sandwich.
On white.
- Yeah. What do you want?
- I wanna get outta here.
Hello?
9:00?
It's either the Ritz upstairs
or Joseph's.
Joseph's.
I'm starved.
So am I.
Will you open the back window?
Step out and open up
the back, will you?
- What's the matter, officer?
- Step out of the car.
- What's goin' on here?
- License and registration, please.
Back of the car, please.
Step to the back of the car.
I got the registration here.
This is all my identification.
Everything's here-
driver's license, registration.
- Where are you goin'?
- That's a Diners. Portland.
- Where are you stayin' in Portland?
- Portland Motel.
Open the bag, please.
- It's all cosmetics, officers.
- Open the bag.
It's the line I'm in.
It's all ladies' stuff.
- That goes right to the bottom.
- What's in the other bag?
- Same thing.
- Open it.
Right-o.
There we are.
What's the big one in the bag?
- That's my personal belongings.
- Let's take a look.
- Here it is, all my coats.
- All right.
- Okay, you can go on.
- Right.
Thank you.
- Hello, boys.
- How much did they actually get?
$2,660,527.62.
- Did you get a receipt?
- No.
The bank has a computer.
We have 32 witnesses who saw everything.
We're gonna have statements
from every one of them, every last detail.
- The fella they shot, how's he?
- Just a slight wound.
- When do you expect to make arrests?
- Any hour.
- How long do you plan to stay in Geneva?
- Three days.
- Business or pleasure?
- Business.
Merci.
- Do you have anything to declare?
- No, nothing.
Georges.
Monsieur Crown.
Do you have the tickets?
- Right here.
- Two baggages?
There's nothing here, Lou.
I've been all over this thing.
Not a thing.
All right.
Sy! Anything?
They're right, Lou.
Looks like an Army surplus smoke bomb.
Lou, they're gonna have a hell of a time
getting it out of this marble.
Anything for me, Ross?
Well, a. 38's a. 38.
No special markings.
Find me a revolver.
They all had sunglasses and hats.
Hey, folks! All right!
Nothing. A great big nothing.
Organized.
Scientific.
We're Boston's finest.
We're dummies.
Do you have that breakdown yet?
16,240 $20 bills,
19,871 $10 bills,
34.465 $5 bills.
129.000 $1 bills.
It's all there.
But what name?
Code name and the number.
- And what address?
- No address.
But we do not know you.
But you will do it.
There will be further deposits-
in cash also.
We're both in the same business.
What else can we do
to help you, sir?
The instructions
can be any month...
any year...
but they must all be dated
the 19th of the month.
- But only the 19th.
- Thank you, sir.
Enjoy my money.
Well, gentlemen,
it's a black day for banking
when five men walk in off the street
and just calmly scoop up-
We've been
all through that, Jamie.
And a black, black day
for law enforcement
when the best thing you can do
is to pray for an informer!
And an inky day for the insurance people
when you have to pay off, right?
Thank you, Mr. MacDonald.
Good day.
Jamie.
Jamie, we don't know who they are,
where they are,
or what they did
with the money-your money.
- They win, we lose.
- So far.
There's someone, a special,
that we like to bring in-
- Come on.
- You won't like her.
I have more important things to do than
to meet some insurance investigator.
I'm just asking you to give her
as much help as you can, to meet her.
There she is.
- You're a love to meet me.
- I want you to meet-
I've missed you.
It's been more than a year.
You don't love me, don't call me,
don't need me, don't pay me.
You've a heart of stone.
You look terrible.
Vicki, I want you to meet Lieutenant
Eddy Malone of the Boston Police.
The man in charge.
I've read your reports.
I've heard about yours.
From old Poison Tongue.
You must be terribly impressed.
Yes, with both of you.
How tactful you are.
Parking in this area
is limited to three minutes.
Please do not leave
your car unattended.
Thank you very much, Warren.
Thank you, Anna.
This isn't my reunion,
so I'll be leaving you here.
- It's a pleasure meeting you, Miss-
- Vicki.
Vicki.
- You call me before you leave town.
- Right.
Isn't he, though?
- Great shot.
- That's a beauty, Mr. Crown.
Damn it to hell.
Only you. Never.
The back side, the 18,
less the front. I make it 20 bucks.
You couldn't get down
from there in two. Never.
I say I can do it again.
You aren't gonna start
with that "again" stuff again, are you?
- The same lie?
- 50-to-1.
I place it an even thousand.
- I take it.
- Bury it.
I'll bury it.
I'll bury it.
Too bad, too bad, too bad.
Tough shot, tough shot.
That's too bad, Tommy.
You almost made it.
Almost.
- Now, another grand.
- Even money?
That's a sucker bet.
You're faded.
That's two grand for you
if you drop it in
and 1,020 for me
if you miss.
Drop! Drop!
You're mad. Absolutely mad.
What else can we do on Sunday?
Morning.
What's in this for you?
Ten percent of
everything recovered.
He knew the bank routine,
he knew the layout.
So do 20,000 others.
Everyone who ever worked there,
every customer.
I've never seen such records.
And we've been over them all.
Looking for what?
A criminal record?
You've gotta know
what to look for.
Every crime has a personality,
a something like
the mind that planned it.
- This one has-
- That's clever.
Very clever.
Okay.
You work your way
and I'll work mine.
Wait a minute, baby.
We're in this together.
You wanted in.
You're gonna get 10%,
so you earn your keep.
Earn it!
All right, Eddy.
Let's start with the money.
- Well, I don't have it.
- What would you do if you did?
$2,600,000 in cash.
Someday you ought to buy
a motor for that thing.
I wish you wouldn't always
undershoot the field like that.
Why?
Come on, Tommy.
It'd end all my worries.
What do you have to worry about?
Who I want to be tomorrow.
A week of thinking.
and what have you got?
Ideas.
Meanwhile, where's the money?
Could be in Switzerland
in numbered accounts.
- Oh, Jesus.
- What else is he gonna do with the money?
Bermuda? The Bahamas?
The rest of the world?
Taxes, records, shaky currency,
people to know, people to trust.
How did he get it through customs?
It's rather bulky, you know.
The Swiss are notoriously casual
about certain formalities.
Airplane luggage,
they hardly ever check at all.
But he'd have to make
more than one trip.
I could contact the airlines,
have them make up a list of names.
- Then I can make up another list.
- The bank list.
I could compare them
in the computer.
- What's that?
- The bank.
Five ways in, five ways out.
Suppose they only met once.
- Oh, that's beautiful.
- Wait a minute.
- That's pure geometry.
- Never?
Never, never before,
after, ever met again.
Lovely?
No, it's impractical.
But why? He could have
met them one at a time.
Why should he trust them
to know each other?
For all we know,
they don't even know him.
Then how did he pay them off?
Maybe he didn't.
Not all at once.
Installments?
They're gonna be awful nervous.
Let's advertise.
Advertise?
"Be a fink for $25,000."
The five files you asked for
are on the desk, Lieutenant.
Sorry to bring you down here like this,
but they can't leave the premises.
I understand. Thank you.
- May I have the pictures?
- Yes. They're all in order.
They are?
Number one.
Bank vice-president, age 46.
He made eight trips to Europe.
Some sort of business.
No.
Number two.
This one is a lawyer.
He made three trips across
in the last 90 days.
He's too square.
He's too square.
Nice.
- You find him attractive?
- Yeah.
He was at the bank six months.
That was a long time ago.
Real estate. Securities.
- Currency arbitrage.
- What's that?
That's buying
and selling currency.
Betting the spread
in two different markets.
Graduated from Dartmouth and Harvard,
business administration.
Socially acceptable,
smart as a whip, and plenty of money.
Two trips to Geneva in May,
and six since our robbery.
$4 million.
36. Divorced.
She kept the children.
He sounds just perfect for you.
What's his name?
Pick your man, pick your man!
Good play by Thomas Crown.
Looks like it's gonna be a goal!
That is the end of the period.
So he plays polo.
Now what?
Eddy, I know he's our man.
I know it.
I just feel it.
I know he's our man.
He's a nice-lookin' boy.
Prove it.
I know it doesn't matter to you,
but it drives me crazy
when you start buying pieces
you don't know anything about.
Enjoyment's enjoyment, Sandy.
Don't worry about it.
All right, all right.
Tommy.
Tommy, for God's sakes, come on.
- We're late as it is.
- All right, Sandy.
Is that one of those
red Italian things?
One of those red Italian things.
- 150.
- 150 I have.
200.
Thank you very much.
200 I have.
At $200.
May I say 225?
Thank you very much.
225.
That's 225.
- 250.
- 250 I have.
Thank you very much.
At 250.
- Let's see what they got here.
- 300.
- At $300.
- 325.
- It's not worth a cent over 500.
- Right, Sandy.
At 325.
It's against you now.
For this very rare and unusual lot
of lithographs depicting the five senses.
And remember, the proceeds
is going to charity,
so have charity in your hearts,
- if you please.
- 350.
Thank you.
350 is the young lady's bid.
At 350. 350.
Now I have $500.
This is more near their value.
And they're still very cheap.
At $500. At 500.
At $500 they're going...
once, twice...
the third and last time...
at $500.
Sold to Mr. Thomas Crown.
Thank you very much.
Hello.
Vicki Anderson, Mr. Crown.
- Where's your camera?
- You remember.
The lithographs.
May I give them to you?
- Then why did you-
- Because I wanted to buy.
Anyhow, it's for charity,
and five is the proper price.
Who do you work for?
Bazaar? Vogue?
World Wide Polo?
- Insurance, Mr. Crown.
- I'm covered.
I hope so.
I investigate.
Anything in particular?
The bank, Mr. Crown.
The caper, sir.
You don't expect us to take a loss
of over $2 million lying down?
It's an interesting picture.
It pays well, though, huh?
Depends on the return.
Sort of an American-type headhunter.
You could put it that way, yes.
And whose head are you after?
- Yours.
- Mine?
Yours.
You know, you practically said
I had something to do with the-
No, I said it.
And not just practically.
Just exactly what have you got?
I can't tell you.
It'd spoil the fun...
yours, mine...
your finding out
just what I've got.
What a funny, dirty little mind.
It's a funny, dirty little job,
so shoot me in the leg.
- Always catch your man?
- Of course.
Think you'll get me?
I hope so.
Tomorrow?
- What about it?
- Us.
Dinner.
Marvelous.
- About 6:00?
- Perfect.
What does a guy
with four million bucks...
want with two million more?
What do you get
for a man who has everything?
Is that what it all
comes down to? Kicks?
There you go.
Get the kid off the bicycle.
We're gonna be late for Mother's.
All right.
Come on, baby.
You like your bike?
It's a good bike, Jimmy.
There we are.
We'll monkey with the bike later.
- Did you write out a check for Mother?
- Yeah, I wrote a check for Mother.
And I'm not gonna jump through any more
hoops for her, so get off my back.
If you didn't spend money all over, you
wouldn't have so much to complain about.
Look at him! He's filthy!
I'm gonna have to give him another bath!
Come on, Jimmy.
- We got one good lead on our ad.
- Oh?
A salesman's wife
from Long Island.
- Ford wagon?
- Yep. And he paid cash.
The same day he bought the car,
he also rented a safe-deposit box.
Can we drill the box?
We could ask for a warrant,
but we wouldn't get it.
- Wouldn't the banks cooperate?
- No, they wouldn't.
Couldn't we just pick up the car?
No, we couldn't. And you won't.
It's against the law.
- That's my car!
- Watch where you're goin'.
Retire? You?
That wouldn't be
an easy matter.
Well...
Just knock off
for a bit, Sandy.
Perhaps a trip
around the world.
Take me a year
to liquidate.
That's what's starting
to bother me.
Mobility?
You've got more than most.
I still feel trapped.
I could give you
the power of attorney.
You could do it for me.
I wouldn't know
what to do with it.
It's here, all laid out,
only to be opened if I leave-
what to hold...
what to sell.
- I can't.
- They stole your car.
Hello.
Speaking.
Who is this?
- Where's Jimmy?
- Hello?
Where? Where is he?
Who is this?
I can't get that kind of money!
I can't-
They got Jimmy.
They want $5,000.
- Call the police-
- No, I can't call the police!
Hey, Dad!
Jimmy!
Where have you been?
How are you, son?
She's a nice lady.
We were lost.
- Who are you, anyhow?
- I'm your friendly insurance man.
The one that paid your bank.
In Boston.
You know,
the one you robbed.
Harry, why don't you take Jimmy home
to his mother? With the money.
Erwin's gonna stick around for a while.
We're gonna have a little talk.
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.
Okay. Come on.
Get in the car.
This is stupid.
Stupid?
You're lucky.
We're givin' you a chance.
Two witnesses
saw you drive away.
We just saw you give $5,000
to the Goodwill.
Where'd you get the money?
Where'd you get the money for the car?
You know somethin', Erwin?
You're goin' to jail.
Your wife will divorce you.
You'll never see your kid again.
I'm sorry.
I really am.
- Where did you meet him?
- New York. in a hotel.
- What did he say?
- "How'd you like to make 50 grand?"
- What'd he look like?
- I didn't see him. He was behind-
- What a mind.
- Yeah. Terrific.
What a man.
Well, you were right. Erwin's checks
come from the Chase Bank in New York.
They get their funds
from a bank in Geneva.
And guess what.
A numbered account.
Well, all you have to do now is bribe
your way through a numbered account.
I can't. You know the Swiss.
I've tried.
You lied to me.
You ran off to New York.
You stole a car. You kidnapped a kid.
You blackmailed his father.
That hurts.
- I do my job.
- Your job?
- What the hell kind of a job is that?
- All right, Eddy, I'm immoral.
So is the world.
I'm here for the money, okay?
- You wanna go in a different direction?
- I do.
- We've been doing well-
- Mr. Crown's office.
- I want you and Alan to cover this.
- Vicki Anderson.
- I'll take that.
- Just a moment, please.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hello there.
Police station?
Oh, unexpected.
Room 515.
Mm-hmm, 6:00.
Well, I'll be there.
Perfect.
Let's finish this later.
We'll bring it in now.
See you this afternoon.
Oh, I'm sorry, but John
called earlier about the rug men.
Rug men?
They were measuring the house
for the wall-to-wall carpeting you wanted.
- What wall-to-wall carpeting?
- I don't know. That's why John called.
Thank you.
Nothing.
- Ready?
- Good night. Have a good time.
I'd like you to meet Thomas Crown.
Mr. Crown, Lieutenant Eddy Malone,
Criminal Investigation.
I'm not gonna say a thing
until I talk to my lawyer.
How do you do?
He's not gonna say a thing until
he sees his lawyer? That's pretty good.
- Shall we go?
- Good night.
Good night.
- Say good night to Erwin, dear.
- Good night, Erwin, dear.
"Good night, Erwin, dear."
That's good.
Like ice.
Round three.
You won a round.
That's your only round so far.
Where should we go
to celebrate?
Home to meet Mother?
No. No mother,
no more wife.
Just a big empty place-
three floors and an elevator.
But I'm building
a summer house down at the beach.
My special place.
But then, you know
all about that, don't you?
- Thank you.
- What a lovely old house.
- When was this built?
- Before you were born.
150 years ago.
- It's exquisite. Is that the elevator?
- That's the elevator.
Excuse me. I'll be down
in just a moment.
John, are the drinks
in the bar in the library?
They're all ready, sir.
Wall-to-wall carpet.
You do live very well,
don't you?
No complaints.
It'd be a shame
to have to give all this up.
Wouldn't it?
Do you play?
Try me.
Check.
Let's play something else.
- Clicking. We're clicking at last.
- Not so fast.
- Morning, Marv.
- But I'm excited.
- Bruno, you got something for me?
- Yeah, Lou, I have.
- Stick around. I wanna talk to you.
- Okay.
He doesn't know
if I do have something.
Keep following him closer
all the time.
Let's cover his phones.
Squeeze him.
Keep the pressure on.
All right. I'll squeeze,
you'll squeeze,
and so will he.
Honey, look out!
- You know what you are?
- I know what I am.
Don't put your labels on me, Eddy.
- All right.
- Look.
It won't be easy.
It won't be fast.
He's the one.
Sweet Jesus!
You are something else.
You really are!
What the hell is this?
It's for your birthday, but I thought
I'd better give it to you now.
- That's quite a view from here.
- Here. Take a good look.
No, not down there
at the bank.
Across the street,
on the roof.
Do you have any idea
how much they're costing you?
- Those characters that follow us around?
- Following you is following me.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
- But they work for you.
I did even worse yesterday.
I'll bet you did.
Internal Revenue.
Beautiful.
Good evening.
Wow.
Take your time, Fred.
It's only another stroker.
Come on. Wake up, fella.
You're under arrest for drunkenness,
drivin' to endanger,
drivin' under the influence of alcohol.
Sit up. You're not hurt.
It's my duty to inform you
of your rights
in the Supreme Court decision,
Miranda case.
Before we ask you any questions,
you must understand your rights.
If you answer questions
without a lawyer-
- Hey, Ben, hold it.
- What's the matter?
I think this is Danny
of the Bank Squad, isn't it?
- Danny?
- Loosen his belt.
- All right?
- Get his tie.
- You all right, Danny?
- Come on, Dan.
- You're being had, Vicki girl.
- Why?
That's hilarious.
Would you like to know where he went
when he left you last night?
No.
That's the third time this week.
Her again.
Dirty old man.
Tommy...
Did you ever bring
anyone else here?
My wife.
She didn't like the sand.
I didn't mean her.
Hey, listen.
She was just a way of putting you
in touch with yourself.
I've never brought anyone
here before.
You can't ever spend it.
Not yours. Not the bank's.
Every penny you spend,
they'll wanna trace.
A tax case every year.
They're on your back, my love.
I've got all I need.
Let me make a deal.
Call your man.
They can't make you testify.
- Yeah?
- Eddy.
He wants to make a deal.
A deal? Sure. Vicki girl.
I'll make a deal.
How about life?
No deals.
- With the money returned, nobody hurt-
- I said no deals!
You understand me?
There'll be no deals.
Samba.
Sugarloaf.
Jungle.
Piranha.
Don't you see?
There's no way out.
You've done too good a job, Vicki.
I'm all hung up.
I did it once...
and I can do it again.
You're joking.
Money's not funny.
You're crazy.
It can't be done.
Why not?
It just can't.
It can't, huh?
It's not the only bank. You've got Erwin
and descriptions of four more.
How do you know
there's only five?
Why?
What would it prove, Tommy?
- You don't need the money.
- It's not the money.
It's not the money.
It's me.
It's me and the system.
The system.
What about me?
I just sit here
and do nothing?
That's it.
You let me try.
It's my funeral.
You're just along for the ride.
The hell with it.
I say pick him up.
- Wait him out. You'll see.
- I'll see, all right.
I'll tell you what I see.
I see a fiasco.
I'm running a sex orgy for a couple
of freaks on government funds!
If you don't have anything,
what does he have to say?
- I talk about it. He talks around it.
- Talk?
- Yes.
- You're sure you find time?
Enough.
Almost done.
They're gonna be great.
What is this, the last supper?
It's tomorrow.
Where?
I'll tell you where the pickup is.
And you can meet me there...
when it's over.
Okay?
Tommy, Tommy...
- Don't-
- Moral support. That's what I need.
Moral support.
Don't test me.
Not this way.
Not if you love me.
I've gotta know
where you're at, Vicki.
Time's running out.
I've gotta know
you're on my side.
No tears.
Not for us.
We're a pair, you and me.
Come on.
Smile.
Try.
- Watch it, will ya?
- I'm sorry.
He's pulling out now.
Pick him up outside the cemetery.
Nowwhat?
Nowwe wait.
You sure he'll come?
He's had two full hours to himself.
I'm sure.
Of course I'm sure.
Where is he?
Did you tell me everything?
Car coming.
It's the Rolls.
All right. Move in.
Box him up.
You said it was your funeral-
You Miss Vicki?
Listen. I have
a telegram for you.
- You want to sign?
- Where'd you get the car?
Left early.
Please come with the money.
or you keep the car.
All my love. Tommy.
Thank you.
