I have sinned against
both man and God.
I've spent ten years in
a hole darker than hell.
Waiting... always waiting.
I still do not know
what this life is for.
Or why it's been given to us.
And I know that a man
has done what I've done...
Does not deserve to dream.
But I still do.
- Come on Boyka.
Yes! Come on, Boyka!
Are you ready..
Are you ready?
Fight!
Whoa...
Another generous donation.
Thank you.
It is my pleasure.
Did you win your last fight?
Yes, father, I did.
Yuri...
We are very grateful
for all your donations.
That help..
Built this church.
If it is salvation you seek..
Violence is not the answer.
But I told you.
It's a sport.
We have rules.
Even if you do have rules...
Do you think God
approves of what you do?
I think God gave me this gift.
And I think it would be
a sin to waste it.
Violence..
Has a way of consuming men.
Then it is hard to see
what good you can do...
When you are surrounded by that.
Boyka, Boyka!
Great news.
I have found a fight.
A real fight.
The fight that you've wanted,
the fight that we've waited for.
- Legitimate fight?
- Yes. And legal,
.. not like this underground shithole.
- Where?
- Budapest.
It's a European divisional tournament.
I convinced the tournament scouts to
come and watch you at your next fight.
If you convince them,
then you're in!
- That's it?
- Yes.
Very good!
Ladies and gentlemen,
A qualification fight!
Sanctioned by the International
Mixed Martial Arts Association.
The winner of this fight.
Will be competing at the
European Championship.
That will be held in Budapest.
Boyka, the scouts are here,
sitting in the front row.
- Good.
- How are you feeling? Are you ready?
I'm ready.
- Are you nervous?
- No.
- How is your Knee?
- Stop asking so many fucking questions.
Before you go I must tell you.
I've seen the other fighter
He's good.
They are all good.
It does not matter.
This one's different.
He is hungry.
He fights like
he needs it.
Like you.
Nothing,
is going to stand in between me,
and that tournament.
Welcome to our ring...
Our own local hero.
Our undisputed champion...
The most complete
fighter in the world,
Yuri..
Boyka..
Boyka! Boyka!
- Hello sir, this is my associate.
- Good, to see you again.
Alright, gentlemen.
You've been over the rules.
Protect yourselves at all times.
We gotta keep this clean.
Now...
go to your corners.
- Are you alright?
- No.
You okay, you okay?
Take your mouth-guard.
Take your mouth-guard.
Stay the fuck down.
Come on! Let me through!
Don't touch him!
Come! Come!
You did it, Boyka! We
can go all the way.
Like I told you!
I never ever doubted you.
Come..
See this crowd?
They love you.
- Congratulations, Boyka.
- Very good, Boyka, very impressive.
It's been a while since we have
seen such an impressive fighter.
Boyka,
two weeks.
We want to see you at the
tournament in Budapest.
- Good.
- So you know, this is your one shot.
You win, and you're
in the big league.
You lose, and it's over.
I don't lose,
I'll be there.
Good.
We'll see you there.
Pretty great no?
This is what you've been fighting for
your whole life Boyka.
And now it's here.
Your winnings from
tonight's fight.
What is the matter him?
He is in very serious condition,
we are taking him to the hospital.
It looks like a concussion.
Do you think God approves what you do?
God gave me this gift.
And it would be a sin to waste it.
Get the fuck out.
- What is it Boyka?
- The man that I fought last night.
They took him
to the hospital.
How is he doing?
You won.
What does it matter,
how's he doing?
Just answer the fucking question.
He is dead.
What do you mean
he's dead?
Don't worry though.
It was an accident.
You are not liable for his death.
It's a risk every fighter takes, Boyka.
What was his name?
Viktor.
Viktor...
Where did he come from?
He is a...
Russian from Drovny.
He is just another fighter.
What about his family?
Did he have a wife?
Children?
How should I know?
I cleaned out his locker.
Forget about him Boyka.
His things from the locker,
l want to see them.
Here,
I got his bag.
He doesn't have any cash,
l already checked.
- I need a fake passport.
- A fake passport for what?
To cross the border.
- I'm going to Russia.
- Russia, are you crazy?
You are a wanted man there.
- Let me worry about that.
- And what about Budapest?
Your dream?
It's in less than 2 weeks.
- You give me the fucking passport or not?
- I can't. It's a mistake.
Will you get me the fucking passport?
Okay. Okay.
But I must warn you.
This can ruin your life Boyka.
It's not this life
I'm worried about.
My condolences.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming..
Thanks.
He was a good man
and a good fighter.
Yes.
- What will you do now?
- We have been together since I was 16.
- I don't know anything else.
- But this is not what I'm talking about.
- This is my husband's funeral.
- He is dead. What does it matter now?
Except for the fact that you owe me,
.. a lot of money.
I will work for you to
pay off the loan.
- You will get every ruble.
- Let me help.
I can make things..
Easier for you.
- You get the passport?
- You're late.
As your manager,
l advice you not to do this.
Just give me the fucking thing.
Boyka, if I can't stop you,
then, at least listen to me.
You've gotten used
to the outside,
You're going to have to be
very careful going back.
Stay away from commercial buses.
Those will only take you to major
border crossings with tight controls.
Best bet is to get on a local minivan...
Assuming which will drive you across
a provisional military checkpoint.
The soldiers there,
they have no internet access.
And generally they're
relaxed and uninterested.
You keep your head down,
and your nose clean...
And you should get through
without any trouble.
After that..
You're on your own.
Visas, passports,
get them out...
Get your papers ready.
Nobody wants to wait on you.
What's your name?
Anton Lagunov.
What were you doing in Ukraine?
Visiting my uncle.
He is dying.
Is there a problem?
No, no problem.
Papers.
- Move it.
- Alright!
Can I help you?
I wanted to speak with her.
Nobody speaks to her.
Where are they going?
- She's going to work now.
- Where?
Come on!
And still undefeated.
Our underground killer, Igor!
This is my ring,
you motherfuckers!
What else was going to happen?
This is my ring!
Who are you?
Are you following me?
No.
I need to talk to you.
About what?
I am working.
No, please. I'm sorry... I,
- I've come very long way to talk to you.
- Hey!
What do you think you're doing?
Get back to work.
Why don't you come with me?
I just want to talk to her.
Come on.
We'll talk outside.
You choose the wrong girl.
Go home.
Look, I only need a
few minutes with her.
She belongs to the boss.
So fuck off.
So, what time does she finish work?
Are you deaf?
Fuck this asshole up.
Bravo.
Bravo.
That was quite a show you put on.
My name is Zourab.
And this is my club.
You should fight for me.
- Here, in my ring.
- Not interested.
- Didn't come here for that.
- Why did you come then?
The girl. The waitress.
I need to tell her something.
Alma.
Well, whatever it is you want to tell her,
you can tell me,
I'll make sure that
she gets the message.
No I give her the
message myself.
Nobody goes near Alma
without my permission.
I own her.
I own this city.
You try to talk to her
one more time...
I'll fucking kill you.
Now get the hell out of my face.
Go on.
Keep an eye on him.
I am the most complete
fighter in the world.
Do you think God approves
of what you do...?
Hey, where do you think
you're going?
Hold it.
You again...
What is it?
I came here today
to tell you that...
I knew your husband, Victor.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
It's very nice of you to come.
Thank you.
Your boss, Zourab...
Does he bother you?
No.
He gave Viktor and me a loan.
So we could open this
community center.
I work just for him
to pay off the debt. That's all.
So, where did you meet Viktor?
Are you a fighter too?
Yes, I'm a fighter.
I met him in Kiev.
Then..
.. did you see his last fight?
It was me.
I was the one in the ring, in Kiev.
It was an accident.
I wanted to come here tell you that...
If there is anything I can do...
Yes,
yes, there is something you can do.
Bring him back.
Can you do this?
No.
This is the money from the fight.
I think you should have it.
This is blood money.
So that's why
you took my husband's life.
You murderer.
Take these back.
And get the hell out of here.
Back to Kiev, or whatever
it is, that you came from.
Get out.
These are children in
front of me, Slava.
It's a waste of my fucking time.
OlegÂ’s, just some new
guy down from the north,
He says we have to see him.
Oleg's guys are Minos.
I need fucking sharks.
Okay!
This is what is available, Zourab.
What do you want?
What do I want?
I want someone to
impress me, Slava.
I want someone who
knows how to hit.
And someone who knows
how to get hit.
Not these fucking bums you
bring me from the streets.
Who are merely piece
of meat with a pulse.
Slava, what do I want..
I want to be fucking entertained!
No wait, wait!
I thought I told you
to leave this town?
I don't give a shit you said.
So, did you reconsider my offer?
How much does she owe you?
- Who?
- Alma.
It's none of your
fucking business.
Well, I'm making it
my fucking business.
She owes me more than you
can ever possibly pay.
Well, then I want to make a deal...
I fight for you,
you wipe her debt.
- Six fights.
- Deal.
- Three fights.
- And then she owes you nothing.
One condition.
You have to beat my champion.
Watch out.
I'm going to fuck... you up.
Just make sure you save
this cunt, the last.
Good.
We start tomorrow.
A night's rest in between each.
Three fights a week.
You really want to loose...
No.
Just in a hurry.
You have a place
l can train?
Sure there is a gym five
blocks east of here.
Slava here will show you.
And one last thing.
It's really nice to do business
with you, Yuri Boyka.
Oh, you surprised?
I told you, this is my town.
I know everything that comes to here.
But don't worry about the police.
They report to me.
Just remember one thing.
My arena,
my rules.
What are you doing?
Some bum off the street?
This is no bum off the street, Slava!
Don't you know a legend..
- When he's punching you in the face?
- Him, what legend?
Slava... Don't you know who Yuri Boyka is?
- Boyka?
- Kiril, I have to stay longer.
Longer? What do you mean?
How much longer?
- Maybe a week.
- What do you mean a week?
Do you remember how long you've waited?
How much you've bled for this moment?
How much money you spent to fix your knee?
Do you know what you're doing?
No, just change the
fucking bus ticket.
I'll be there.
- I didn't ask you to fight for me.
- I just want to help you.
I don't want your help,
l don't want your money.
I just want you to
leave me alone.
I'll leave you alone..
As soon as I finish the fights.
It's the least I can do
for you and your husband.
What do you want from me?
I don't want anything from you.
Do you think I'm for sale?
Someone you can...
just win over in a fight?
I'm not fighting to own you.
I'm fighting to pay your debt.
So you can be free.
Oh..
So you came all this way,
to save me?
I come here to save myself.
Alma, get back in the car.
It's time to go.
- What?
- This is my fucking bag.
It won't be long.
I don't want you using it.
Hey!
It's time.
Ladies and gentlemen.
So place your bets.
In the red corner,
a fierce contender.
Yuri Boyka!
And now, in the blue
corner a local fighter.
He is quick. He is deadly.
He is Boris Tarsov!
Fight!
Hey, wait!
You can have your fun for now, Yuri Boyka.
But just remember,
this is my ring.
Well done. Nothing less than I expected.
But don't get too comfortable.
First one is always easy.
Why don't you get our
winner here a drink?
Here...
You must be thirsty.
Thank you.
You know a place
where I can train?
Yes.
There is a gym down the street.
No that's place, it's
covered down with rats.
Come to the community center tomorrow.
You can use the one there.
I am fighting for your boss now.
You're going to try stop me again?
It's not much.
But if you like it,
you can use it.
Very good.
Hey, stop bothering the man.
Let him work.
It's fine.
It's okay. Let them stay.
Do you need something?
Just needed water.
It's not bothering you there,
the training?
No. I've missed it.
Viktor never stopped training.
Day or night.
Double your bets!
Because we have something
special for you tonight.
The Ozerov brothers!
That's right,
Ladies and gentlemen.
Two against one. Two of them!
- Provides the fun!
- Yeah! Ha ha!
Remember, Boyka!
My arena, my rules.
Now, let's see what you can do.
Fight!
I hope you're ready.
I've kicked their
shit out off worse.
And the winner by double knockout...
Yuri Boyka!
Koychev, my friend.
Here...
Get rid of those who can't
keep their mouth shut.
And the other stack,
what's that for?
Proposition.
I want you to get me Koshmar.
Koshmar, The nightmare?
I want him here.
It's impossible.
I can't get him
out of prison anymore.
Last time almost cost me my job.
Yes you can.
You're not gonna just
make more money.
There's a bonus...
when I give you an
escaped convict.
Yuri Boyka.
My husband..
.. used to train after matches too.
He said that it was best time,
when the muscles still hurt.
Here,
ointment for your back...
My grandmother's recipe.
Give it to me.
- It's fine I...
- It's okay. Give it to me.
Sit down.
You do not have to fight for me, you know?
You can leave this town anytime you want.
Why don't you leave here?
Just take whatever you need,
and get the hell out.
To leave?
This place was our dream.
This center...
The kids here know,
l will never abandon them.
Without a place like this,
all of these kids will be in
gangs or something worse.
But you probably won't
know anything about it.
You can keep the rest.
Slava.
Did your men watch Boyka?
Yes. Just like you said,
for the whole time
that he was there.
And?
He just trains. That's it.
Two hours. Then he leaves.
And she?
What does she do?
Nothing, she doesn't even talk to him.
She can barely even look at him.
You work too hard.
I don't have a choice.
- Please don't to touch me.
- Why?
Is it because of Boyka?
I hear that he spends
time here, too much time.
He just needs a place to train.
He's an animal.
A cold-blooded killer.
The man, that murdered your husband.
That was an accident.
Was it truly an accident?
When his fists pounded
into your husband's skull.
Over and over and over.
Please, stop it!
It is not how it happened.
You fucking him,
aren't you?
How dare you?
You know how much I loved Viktor.
I want you to leave right now.
No.
Please let go off me.
He is not allowed here.
I'll fucking kill him,
if you let him back in.
Kiril?
Boyka, the arena is already crawling
with fans waiting to see you.
Your name has been published in
all the newspapers and billboards.
It's good.
Don't forget,
your bus is at 9.45 pm tonight.
Don't be late.
The press is waiting to talk to you.
Don't worry,
l will be there.
What are you doing here?
The fight with my husband.
Can you tell me
what happened?
I think it's better if
we don't talk about it.
Why?
Do you have something to hide?
- I just don't want to hurt you.
- I can take it.
Just look into my eyes
and tell me the truth.
Was it really an accident?
I've done things in this life, Alma.
Terrible things.
Things that put me in the
prison for a long time.
I was a bitter,
angry man, full of hate.
Until God showed me the path.
I've had hundreds of fights.
Hundreds.
In the shittiest of arenas to the
darkest, deepest, hellhole prisons...
you could possibly imagine.
But I never lost sight
of the gift God gave me.
And then one day...
God,
He opened up the doors
to me and gave me the chance,
to prove myself to the world.
He was testing me, and I was
not going to disappoint him.
And so...
In the ring.
With Viktor.
I did not see a man.
I did not see a husband.
Only someone standing in
between me and my dream.
But I did not mean to kill him.
I'm sorry.
And I know it's not enough
to take away your pain.
But I've regret it.
I've regret it with all my soul.
We have a spectacular show for you tonight.
So place your bets and take your seats.
In the red corner,
we have a fearsome fighter
who's been undefeated so far,
so, let's hear it for..
Yuri..
Boyka..
Boyka!
And in the blue corner...
the big, bad man-killer...
Our undisputed Drovny
underground champion,
Igor Kazimir!
You're fucking dead!
Welcome to my world
motherfucker.
You remember what I told you?
- Yes. Your ring. I know.
- I'm going to fuck you.
Very good fight, Boyka.
Where are you going?
I have a bust to catch.
It's over. She is free.
What's over?
We had a deal.
Yes. The deal was three fights
and you have to beat my champion.
What does that fucking
lgor look to you?
Who? This guy?
He is not my champion.
He was your third fight!
Now you have to defeat my champion.
This is fucking bullshit.
- I am not fighting for you anymore.
- Yes you are Boyka.
Cause if you don't,
then we don't have a deal.
Don't you want to save her?
Don't you want to be her hero?
You walk away now...
and her debt still remains.
Unless you want me to sell
her like a piece of meat,
you're going to fight.
And after my champion
crushes your skull.
You and I will be done,
and the girl will be mine.
Are you already at the bus station?
- I cannot leave yet.
- Are you crazy? What is wrong with you?
- Your bus leaves in 15 minutes.
- What time is the last bus?
10 pm. If you miss it,
you won't get your flight to Budapest.
I won't miss it.
So what are we waiting for?
Bring me your fucking champion.
For the main event of the night,
A true monster fresh out of prison.
Koshmar... The nightmare!
Fight!
Call Koychev.
Zourab!
Let go off me!
No!
No!
This is what happens..
When you
don't give me what I want.
You choose a murderer.
An animal!
Didn't make it clear to you?
Didn't I give you every
fucking opportunity?
Every opportunity I gave you.
Now you're going to watch him die.
No!
Drop the gun.
Drop it.
We had a deal,
you piece of shit.
Let her go!
And what? What do you
think is gonna happen?
You're an escaped convict, Boyka.
What can you possibly give her?
You are a fucking washed
up two-bit fighter..
Just like her fucking dead husband.
You're hurt. We have to
get you to a doctor.
Alma.
I need to ask you something.
The day you came to see me,
you asked me what it
was I wanted from you.
I did not know how to
say it at that time...
But I needed to ask you
for your forgiveness.
For what I did to your husband.
Come on.
We can still get you out of here.
- Please.
- No. I need to know.
Can you forgive me?
Yuri Boyka. You are under arrest.
Do you forgive me?
It's good to see you, Yuri.
How have you been?
I'm fine.
I did not expect to see you.
How are the kids?
They are doing great.
They drew these pictures for you.
I'm sorry.
I wanted to come visit earlier,
but I couldn't.
I wasn't ready.
I understand.
When I first saw you,
I didn't know what to say or do.
I was too angry. I was...
lost.
But then you showed me something.
You've showed me that there
was still good in the world.
And that's why I came here today.
To thank you, Yuri.
For giving me back my dignity,
my freedom.
And because,
I you to know that...
I forgive you.
Thank you.
