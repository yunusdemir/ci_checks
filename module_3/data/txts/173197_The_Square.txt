<i>Are you awake?</i>
- Christian?
- What?
Do you need anything?
It's time for the next one.
- What?
- It's time for your next interview.
- Yeah.
- Do you need a few minutes?
- A glass of water?
- Just give me a couple of minutes.
- Okay. See you in Gallery One.
- Right.
We need a soundcheck.
So, what did you have for breakfast?
I had some bread, cheese
and cornflakes.
- An egg.
- I'll just...
Some juice, coffee.
Are we all set?
I need a hand over here...
The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.
Within its boundaries, we all share
equal rights and obligations.
Do you want to save a human life?
- Do you want to save a human life?
- Not right now.
Do you want to save a human life?
Do you want to save a human life?
- Do you want to save a human life?
- Sorry?
Help!
Help!
Help!!
Help!!!
You have to help me,
he's going to kill me!
- Hey, calm down.
- He's going to kill me. Help! Please!
- What's the matter?
- Help me, he's going to kill me!
Get a grip on yourself!
- He's going to kill you too!
- Calm down! Shut up!
- Hey, back me up here!
- But I don't...
- Okay, what's going on?
- Someone's howling over there.
- I can't see anyone.
- He's going to kill us!
- Would you calm down!
- He's going to kill us!
- No, no...!
- No, don't...
- What the hell?!
- Cool the fuck down!
- I wasn't going after you guys!
- What the hell?
Have a nice day, guys.
- Bloody idiot!
- What a bloody idiot!
- Bloody idiot!
- What the hell just happened?
That was insane...
What a fucking idiot! Jesus...
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Is your heart pounding?
- Yeah.
My heart's like...
- Good thinking, getting me in on it.
- I just reacted.
Asking for help,
that was really smart.
- I was scared, how about you?
- Well...
- Right...
- Yeah, all right.
- Take care!
- Have a nice day.
Excuse me, may I please borrow
your phone?
Could you please help me?
Could I please borrow your phone?
I just need some help.
Have you seen any of his work before?
No.
This is what "The Square" looks like.
Right.
And the exhibition will open
on September 15.
That's right.
I've booked the usual billboards,
and ad space in two
of the major daily newspapers.
Okay.
- So, we've done some prep already.
- Right. You see...
Listen, this is a very nice project
that raises important issues.
But, from a communications point
of view,
the values are too general.
We need to talk about the difference
- between art and marketing.
- I totally agree.
For every new project, we need
to assess how newsworthy it is.
What makes this exhibition stand out?
Does it involve any controversy?
Can we tie it to trends
or current events?
If not, you're stuck
with the billboards.
That makes it hard to generate
any international attention.
Then you'll only reach
the usual "culture vultures".
To get journalists to write about it,
you need some controversy.
Only this project doesn't really have
much of an edge.
As a journalist, I want
to create my own standpoint.
Like most people, I want to express
an opinion that isn't just consensus.
I'd never post a Facebook status like
"Daniel wants peace on Earth."
- So...
- Hang on.
There's more to this exhibition
than a Facebook update.
Of course.
Its strength lies in its simplicity.
That's what we should communicate.
Definitely, just let me read this.
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.
Within its boundaries, we all share
equal rights and obligations."
No one would disagree with that.
So why should I, as a journalist,
care?
Well... You dropped this.
My point is, that this isn't
about the statement.
What's important is...
what this square activates
in its audience.
- We understand.
- That's what we want to communicate.
May I clarify something?
The guys aren't disputing
the legitimacy of the project.
As long as we agree on the content.
And they're not questioning
what you're trying to explore.
They're simply trying to explain
how the media landscape works,
and what it takes to make an impact.
I've been thinking...
How about doing something
like the Ice Bucket Challenge?
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Only what was it?
It was a viral success...
Well,
ordinary people, or celebrities,
filmed themselves
getting buckets of ice-water poured
all over them.
And it went viral.
- It was huge!
- It was all over the place.
Sure, but what was the point
of it all?
- There was no point.
- You make it sound corny.
It was to promote ALS research.
It generated one billion kronor,
so, it was a very
successful campaign,
but it wouldn't be viable here.
Your ambition level is high.
Our ambition level is high.
Together, we should shoot
for something bold.
- I agree.
- That's what we're trying to explain.
We need to take a leap.
Do something fresh.
And these guys know how.
They were born
into this fast-moving arena.
- It's their home turf.
- Perfect.
We have everything we need,
so, let's go back
to the drawing board.
Next week we'll present our ideas
and we'll take it from there.
- Sounds great.
- Good, sounds exciting.
- Can we keep these?
- Sure.
This will be great, Christian.
So, how are things?
- The craziest thing just happened.
- What?
- The craziest thing happened to me.
- Today?
Listen, I want you all to hear this.
It's un-fucking-believable.
And after Christian says goodbye
to the other guy,
he checks his pockets and his wallet,
his phone and his cufflinks are gone.
- You must be kidding!
- I don't understand how they did it.
And now my phone is down there.
- It's really close.
- And we're here.
- So surreal...
<i>- Hello...</i>
Elena, check this out.
<i>I need a print of the press release.</i>
Come here.
- Can you see what that is?
- No.
Of course, you can't.
Well, it's my phone.
On my way to work this morning,
I was robbed.
They took my phone,
they took my wallet,
and they even took my cufflinks!
I have no idea how they did it.
So, what do you say?
Is that your work phone?
It's the only phone I have.
Work or private,
it's the phone I use.
- It's almost time, isn't it?
- Yes.
- See you out there.
- I'm on my way.
- Will you...?
- Sure.
We'll talk about
the next step later on.
Yeah.
We will be presenting
the Argentinean artist
and sociologist Lola Arias.
Lola's art is inspired
by Nicolas Bourriaud,
and his thoughts
on relational aesthetics.
In short,
relational aesthetics explores
how we relate to each other
in a social context.
I'm sorry,
this all sounds very stiff.
May I start over again?
Would that be okay?
Cool.
I'll lose the notes...
I don't need them.
Now off with these...
Because the project
I'd like to tell you about...
It means so much to me
that I'd prefer to speak
from the heart.
This is a very special night.
Our museum has received a donation
from Anna-Stina and Gunnar's
50 million kronor.
Now I'd like to ask
our chief curator, Christian,
to tell you
about our first acquisition
with this donation, a piece known as
"The Square",
which you may have seen
on your way in.
An exhibition will also be tied
to this artwork.
Thank you for joining us,
Christian.
Dear Friends of the Museum,
we will be presenting
the Argentinean artist
and sociologist Lola Arias,
and her artwork "The Square".
Lola's art is inspired
by Nicolas Bourriaud,
and his thoughts
on relational aesthetics...
What's so funny?
Oh, a phone is ringing?
Is it for me?
Let's wait and see.
Erik? Is it for me?
My mother usually calls
at this hour.
May I take this opportunity
to start over?
It all felt a bit too stiff.
Let me lose the mic.
I'd like you to do something for me.
Are you game? Okay.
I'm asking you to imagine
that you are standing
in a public place in town.
Such as Odenplan,
or any other large city plaza.
Are you there now? Okay.
It's an ordinary day and lots
of people are in motion.
You look down and see
that you are standing inside a square
a clearly defined
4 x 4 metre square.
That's what "The Square" is
on a physical plane.
It's like an empty frame waiting
for its contents.
Lola Arias compares "The Square"
to a pedestrian crossing.
A pedestrian crossing
Drivers are to look out
for pedestrians.
In a similar way,
there is a contract implied by
"The Square", to look out
for each other.
We help each other.
If you enter this space
and ask for help,
anyone passing by is obligated
to help you.
"I'm hungry.
Can you help me with a meal?"
"Can you teach me how to swim?"
"My father just died
and I have no one to talk to.
Could you spare me
30 minutes of your time?"
Some of you may be thinking
that this sounds naive.
Maybe even utopian.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The exhibit opens in late summer,
and you just can't miss it.
And now I hope you're hungry.
We have a treat for you.
Jonas, will you present the food?
I'm sure you'll do that better
than me.
- Hello!
- Hello.
We've prepared a lovely buffet
for you.
Corn-fed chicken smothered
in mushrooms,
asparagus marinated
in truffle oil...
And celeriac roasted
to sweet perfection...
Please don't rush.
Slow down!
There's a sauce, too.
Pan juices refined with a touch
of balsamic vinegar, honey and sage.
Enjoy!
Can I ask you something?
The GPS in my car...
- Yeah.
- It's always about 50 metres off.
- Is that location reliable?
- It's right there.
- It may be 10 metres off, tops.
- That's too much.
We may not know which flat,
but we can be certain
of the building.
Listen, I have an idea.
Let's write a threatening letter
that we distribute in the building,
putting it in all the letterboxes.
That way, we get to whoever did this.
There could be 15 floors.
- So, what? It's not a problem.
- Eight flats on each floor...
I'll do it. It's fine.
Isn't a threat a bit over the top?
"To the person who robbed me,
I'll bash your head in
if you don't return my stuff."
No, no.
Come on, that's way too violent.
These people are criminals,
that's how they roll.
It doesn't justify bad behaviour
from us.
Don't be so Swedish!
Ditch the political correctness crap.
They should fucking pay for this.
"We know who you are
and where you live, obviously,
or you wouldn't be getting this."
Good one. Very good.
- And then they...
- Hang on!
"We know who you are
and obviously where you live,
or this would never have reached
you."
New paragraph.
"Return my wallet, my phone,
and the cufflinks
that once belonged
to my grandfather."
They were my grandfather's.
- I'll type while you eat.
- Sure.
Okay if I ditch Comic Sans?
Find something less childlike.
I didn't pick it.
It's a 90s all-time favourite.
Now it won't look like
a kid's birthday party invitation.
- After all, it is a threat!
- This is insane!
- Go on. Continue.
- Just a second.
"My phone"...
"...and my grandfather's
cufflinks within 24 hours"...
You missed the "my"
in front of grandfather.
"My wallet, my phone,
and grandfather's cufflinks"...
It's getting v-e-r-y personal.
"...to the 7-Eleven
by the Central Station
or we'll be back..."
Should we add a skull?
No emoticons, that's for texting.
- Right, it's too childish.
- Let's print this shit!
- Let's go!
- Fifty copies.
They're driving like bloody maniacs!
- Could we listen to some music?
- Sure.
How about a golden oldie
from back home...
- Gasoline!
- Don't you have anything more upbeat?
This is more upbeat.
Cool, you've got Justice.
Track 5.
- What?
- Justice. Track 5.
That's the one.
- Okay.
- It's awesome. Put it on.
Come on, crank it up loud.
I haven't listened to Justice
for ages.
The paradox is that
they're called Justice.
And what are we out to get?
- That's not a paradox.
- Well, maybe not...
But we're out to get justice,
aren't we?
Yeah.
- That's great timing!
- It certainly is.
Are you ready?
Turn it up!
Isn't this great?
This is what happens
when they steal your phone.
- We're coming with the cavalry!
- Coming at them with a hammer.
- A great, big hammer.
- Out for justice...
In a Tesla.
- The Tesla of Justice!
- You're crazy.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Are you going?
One of us has to watch the car.
I'll do it.
- You'll do what?
- I'll watch the car.
I'll watch the car.
This is kind of embarrassing, but...
You are aware that I'm sort
of a semi-public figure?
- Yeah, yeah.
- People know who I am.
There's a good chance
I'll be recognized.
Not here.
- They wouldn't know who you are.
- True.
But I wasn't the one who was robbed.
But this was your idea.
Oh, yes, it was.
You suggested writing a letter.
Right?
I just wanted to help out.
So, I can't see why...
Let's just skip the whole thing,
it doesn't matter.
Let's get out of here.
Give me your jacket.
I can't go in there in this suit.
Hand over your jacket, you sissy.
Being a sissy has nothing to do
with it.
You're a sissy!
Hang on. I'm sorry...
Do you remember saying you'd run in
with the letters?
- I never said that.
- You did.
"It's dead easy, you just..."
- I did say that.
- You did.
But I never said
I'd do it, personally.
As your boss, I'm curious
to know if I can count on you.
If you promise to do something,
can I count on you?
- Of course you can.
- Really?
I'm willing to overlook it this time,
but in the future?
You can count on me.
Yeah, yeah.
That's cool.
Motherfuckers...
<i>Thirteenth floor.</i>
<i>Going down.</i>
Hello?!
Shit.
This is totally insane.
Yes, this is my car,
but I'm kind of busy.
It's a cool car.
Could you start it up?
- What?
- Start it up. Drive...
Could you please not touch it?
- You might scratch it.
- I'm not doing anything.
I just want you to start her up.
No, I don't feel like it.
Come on, don't be such a drag,
I've never seen one of these.
It's just an ordinary car.
Nothing special, dead boring.
Have a nice evening.
What the hell?
What do you think you're doing?
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I want.
Listen, stop this crap...
- Go! Go!
- What?
All right! Get in!
I think we hit something.
Yeah, I guess we did...
Could you pull over...
so I can take a look?
Please, I have three children
and diabetes. One krona?
Excuse me... Please, one krona?
- Thank you, ma'am.
- A little money? Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am. Please, kind ma'am.
Hello, help me... One krona, please.
Hello, help me. One krona, please.
Thank you. Help me, please.
Do you want to save a human life?
Do you want to save a human life?
Do you want to save a human life?
- Hello.
- Hi.
How are you today?
Money...
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
But I could buy you something to eat.
Chicken ciabatta.
- What?
- Chicken ciabatta.
- Okay, chicken ciabatta.
- Yeah.
What did you say?
- "No onions"?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'd like a pay-as-you-go SIM card
and one chicken ciabatta.
Has anyone dropped off a parcel
or letter addressed to "Christian"?
Peggy?
- Peggy?
- Yes?
Has anybody dropped off a parcel?
A parcel?
A parcel or a letter for Christian?
- No.
- Nothing?
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Have a nice day.
Here's your ciabatta.
Pick the onions out yourself.
Cock, goddammit!
Show us your boobs!
We apologize,
my husband has Tourette's.
Whore!
- Fuck off!
- That's enough.
Cocksucker! Whore!
This is outrageous.
Shut up! Go home! Fuck off!
We have this one opportunity
to meet this fantastic artist...
Show us your boobs!
Let's continue.
Everyone is welcome,
irrespective of views...
Go home! Fuck off! Suck cock!
- We can't hear a thing.
- The atmosphere is stressing him out.
Shut up! Go home!
Camel toe!
Try to be a bit tolerant.
The man is suffering
from a neuropsychiatric disorder.
This isn't voluntary,
so show some tolerance.
What are you up to?
Algot, come here.
She's off her rocker...
Hello, my name is Christian.
I believe you called me?
Well, I'll be damned!
Unbelievable.
Money?
- This is for you.
- Thank you.
- And this...
- Thank you.
Thank you...
Attention, people...
This is a very special place.
Right behind here...
I'm serious,
this is the Royal Palace.
The former private quarters
of the king and queen is next door.
And one person here tonight has
the keys...
We thought we'd pop in
and have a look.
Oh, crap! We have...
Don't forget to be extremely careful
with the interiors.
- Josefina!
- Come with us...
Do you know this one?
No.
I am not going to sleep
with her tonight.
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, is this Christian?</i>
Yeah.
<i>This is the Central Station
7-Eleven.</i>
<i>I'm calling to say
that there's a parcel here,</i>
<i>waiting for you.</i>
There must be
a misunderstanding,
I picked it up yesterday.
<i>This came just a little while ago.</i>
<i>I'm holding it as we speak.</i>
<i>It has "Christian" written on it,
so it has to be yours.</i>
- And it was dropped off today?
<i>- Yes, today.</i>
That's strange...
Could you open it for me?
<i>- You want me to open it?</i>
- If that's possible, please do.
<i>There's a little note inside.</i>
Is there a message?
<i>- Yes, want me to read it to you?</i>
- Yes, please.
<i>"You accused me of being a thief.</i>
<i>Apologize to me
and my family,</i>
<i>or I'll make chaos with you."</i>
Oh, I'll be darned...
"Chaos", you said?
<i>Yes."Or I'll make C-H-A-O-S
with you."</i>
Yeah, well, I'll pick it up
as soon as I can.
<i>There's a phone number here
too, want me to say it?</i>
No, never mind, I'll come
and get the parcel.
- Thank you for calling.
<i>- Great, bye.</i>
- Will you be wearing your hair up?
- That's the plan.
- Okay
- Is it time?
One, two, three...
Yes!
<i>What's up!</i>
- How are you feeling about this?
- Great.
We're getting closer.
I'm excited to hear
what you've come up with.
- Right. Are you all set?
- Absolutely.
- It's great to be back.
- Great to have you back.
This project raises many interesting,
topical and humanitarian issues.
But the challenge here,
is to cut through the media clutter.
Your competition isn't other museums,
it's disasters, terrorism,
and controversial moves
by far-right politicians.
Keep that at the back
of your mind, stay calm,
and Daniel will tell you
about our idea.
Moving media,
that's what we recommend.
When making films today,
you need to be aware
that people have
a very short attention span.
If the viewer isn't hooked in
two seconds, they'll move on.
In 10 to 15 seconds, tops,
we also have to create
something so powerful or interesting
that people want to share it
on Facebook,
social media, to the press,
thereby creating a viral effect.
We conducted market research
on what's shared the most
on social media.
It's generally vulnerable groups.
People post about women,
the disabled,
the racialized, LGBTQ people...
You can make that list longer,
but there is one group
that affects people
beggars.
So we'd like to use a beggar
in this clip,
but also turn it up a notch
by making the beggar a child.
In addition to this,
the beggar will have fair hair.
Personify the Swedish...
What are you thinking?
We open on the Palace courtyard.
The Square is visible.
So, there's product placement
from frame one.
Towards this artwork...
is daybreak and the Square,
is shimmering
with its promise of trust,
caring, moral courage
and all that good stuff...
Then we see a little girl
approaching the Square.
She's shivering.
She's all alone. She's crying.
She's wrapped in a dirty blanket
and you sense
that she's homeless.
These are powerful images
so we've hooked the viewer.
The girl keeps on walking...
- Excuse me?
- Sorry, please go on.
Powerful images, you wonder where
it's all heading.
She's crying
as she moves along...
She enters the Square...
And there,
it's time for the unexpected.
The total opposite of everything
the Square stands for.
The surprise effect will generate
the attention we need,
creating the perfect platform
to express your message.
All those values and issues
your exhibition
would like to raise.
Exciting...
And not at all what I expected.
- That's good.
- A novel approach.
That's what we wanted
to achieve.
So, what happens?
Exactly what happens?
Well, we haven't quite figured
out exactly what that will be,
but in one way or another,
the girl will get hurt
inside the Square.
What do you mean by "get hurt"?
Well, it's the last thing
viewers expect,
and opposite of...
- Hello.
- Great! Come on in.
Michael, can I bother you for a sec?
Christian, it would
be great if you could join us.
It would be great
if you could join us.
- Let's take it from the top.
- He needs to be on board with this.
This looks fine.
It's the right approach.
Go ahead, run with it.
- I could run through it...
- I've got to go.
- Bye.
- But...
Okay, we'll do a recap later.
Let's move on.
Explain, please.
What's happening here is exactly
what we want to achieve.
Questions like these reflect
how the general public
and the media will react.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Don't be...
Excuse me...
What's your name?
Hello...
- Yes, you.
- Nicki.
- Do you have a drivers' license?
- Yes.
Come along.
- Right now?
- Yes. Please.
We have, of course,
prepared for crisis management.
That's part of our risk analysis,
to prepare for any external concerns.
The same concerns I sense here.
We can handle them.
Don't make me angry!
Don't act stupid!
I don't know
what you're talking about.
- It says "Christian" here. And there.
- Yes, but...
- Oh. Are you Christian?
- No, he's my boss.
- Your boss? Where's your stupid boss?
- Listen...
- Where's your stupid boss?
- Lower your voice.
I've got nothing to do
with all this...
- I want his phone number.
- You can't have it.
Why not? Look what he did to me,
I need to talk to him.
I'm really sorry,
we made a mistake.
What? Why did you write this?
My parents think I'm a thief.
They won't let me play ball,
or anything! All thanks to you!
- Hey, listen...
- You put this in my letterbox.
It wasn't me, it was my boss.
No, you did this!
You're lying. You're Christian.
- He's lying to me!
- Calm down.
Look what he put in our letterbox!
Now my parents think
I'm a thief.
- My boss was robbed...
- All I get to do is stay home and rot
They took his phone
and his wallet...
So, he put a note
in all the letterboxes.
- What are you laughing at?
- Well, it's...
- You bastard! Shut up.
- Chill...
- You can't fight in here.
- Look at what he wrote.
Don't I have the right
to be angry?
I don't know who's right here.
He's pretending
to have a boss called Christian.
And he's pretending that
he can't understand my Swedish...
Translate, so the idiot understands.
Stop calling me an idiot.
- Give me his number!
- Shh! Calm down!
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey! What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?
What do you expect me to do?
I didn't do this!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm sorry, but...
- This is not a good time.
- It's an emergency.
- What?
- Excuse me. Sorry.
All right...
One of the cleaners managed
to sweep up
parts of the Gijoni exhibit.
- The piles don't look the same.
- Are you pulling my leg?
Are the piles gone?
No, but they don't look the same.
And we found a bag full of gravel.
So, I'll call the insurance company.
No, no! No, don't do that.
Where's the gravel?
The gravel that was swept away?
In a bag? Great.
And we have photos, don't we?
Um-hm.
Meet me downstairs in 5 minutes,
with the photos and the gravel,
and we'll fix it.
Without telling anyone at all.
She doesn't understand a thing,
she's American.
Are you serious?
We're going to fix the piles?
Sure, it will be fine. Hm?
We'll sort it out.
"You accused me of being a thief.
You will apologize to me
and my family,
or I will make chaos with you."
- Daddy!
- Why didn't you open the door?
And why didn't you pick us up!
It wasn't my turn to do it.
- We had to call Mummy!
- She didn't tell me...
- Go inside, you idiot!
- Stop it!
No... What's going on here?
What's wrong?
Don't fight like that...
What's wrong with you?
- You twerp!
- I hate you!
- Let go!
- Stop it!
Hey, hey...!
What are you doing?
No, go to your room.
What's the matter, Lise? No!
Lilly? What have I said
about slamming doors?
What have I said about that?
What have I said
about slamming doors?
We've talked about this.
What's wrong with you two?
Lise? You're the eldest...
What's all this?
Hello?
Why are you fighting like this?
What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, it was my fault.
I raised my voice. I shouldn't have
shouted like that.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Do you want to wait here
while I go get Lise? All right?
Welcome! I'm delighted
to see such a crowd.
Here are sets for our new exhibition,
one that is very promising indeed.
To enter, you have to decide
whether you trust other people,
or that you don't, you mistrust them.
This is done by pressing
the appropriate button.
You're welcome to do that now.
Excited?
Let's see what happens next.
- Should we?
- What do you think?
- That's what it says.
- So, shouldn't we?
- Here?
- Mm-hm.
Is that okay?
Does it feel strange?
Yes.
It'll be interesting to see
if they're still there
when we get back.
This reminds me of something
your grandpa told me.
He was a boy, about 6 years old.
And he was about to go out
and play...
His parents made him a tag and wrote
his name and address on it.
They hung it around his neck
and sent him off to play
all by himself
in the middle of Copenhagen.
Imagine if I had done that
to you when you were six.
That never would have happened.
Attitudes change...
Back then,
people trusted other grownups,
to help their children if they had
problems or had lost their way.
But nowadays, you tend to regard
other adults as potential threats.
- Do you understand?
- What's that got to do with this?
Everything. Read this again
and you'll understand.
Read it again. Out loud.
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."
I don't have any cash.
Sorry, I don't have any cash.
I don't have any cash.
Hello?
<i>Hello, I'm Pauline
from YouTube Sweden.</i>
- Oh, hello...
<i>- Congratulations to 300k.</i>
- Excuse me?
<i>- Congratulations to 300,000 clicks.</i>
- 300,000 views?
<i>- That's right.</i>
<i>Your video has seen a lot of traffic
in just a few hours.</i>
Really? Well, that's nice.
I presume you're referring
to our artist talk.
<i>No, it's "Blonde Child Beggar
Gets Blown Into Pieces".</i>
<i>The reason I'm calling is to ask</i>
<i>if you are interested in any ads,</i>
<i>thereby sharing partner revenue.</i>
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I need to get my head around this...
We have a clip-on YouTube
that features kids being blown up?
<i>I haven't seen
the clip myself...</i>
<i>I don't work with content.</i>
No, of course not.
Listen, can I call you back
in ten minutes
when I know more about this?
<i>- Sure.</i>
- I'll do that. Great. Bye.
This so can't be happening.
Unbelievable...
Excuse me, could you help me?
No?
- Could you give me a hand?
- Sorry...
- Well,
- He's here.
at least we got people talking.
<i>...have produced this
video with taxpayers' money...</i>
Hello...
Hi, Elna.
<i>And the other thing they do,
that they are clueless about,</i>
<i>is to attack one of Sweden's</i>
<i>most vulnerable groups,
the beggars.</i>
<i>People who sit day
and night outside shops.</i>
<i>A video like this is pissing
them straight in the face.</i>
<i>What's really sick is that
my 6-year-old daughter...</i>
- Could you turn that off?
<i>- ...sees body parts flying...</i>
Who's that idiot?
Elna, this is an opportunity
to take a stand.
We, as a museum, mustn't
be afraid to push boundaries.
To transcend all kinds of taboos.
Nothing should stand in the way
of freedom of expression.
That's my conviction.
It's something to stand up for.
Without a doubt.
BabyBjrn...
Do you think they'll want
to donate money to this museum?
You do realize
that I didn't have anything
to do with this video?
- I didn't make it...
- That's totally irrelevant.
Really.
I have a board meeting to attend.
And I want to make sure
that you will comply
with any decisions we make.
Well, that depends
on what we're talking about.
That would be decisions related
to the consequences of all this.
- Obviously.
- Okay.
Good.
Girls, if you want to draw,
there are some crayons
over there.
- No...
- You don't want to? Why not?
One more thing.
We need new press photos of you.
- What for?
- On the ones we've, you're smiling.
Welcome.
Christian?
Keep in mind that they don't know
about the clip.
- What's happening?
- This will be exciting!
- This is rather fierce.
- Yes.
Let's have a round of
applause... for Oleg Rogozjin.
Amazing!
Great! Thank you very much.
Oleg, I just said that...
I'm just saying that...
I'm just saying...
Help...
Hey...
That hurts a bit...
Hello? Help...
Fredrik, could you help me?
Okay... Help!
Stop it! Hey! Stop it!
Kill him, for God's sake!
Are you Christian?
Are you Christian?
Daddy?
Why don't you go upstairs?
This won't take long.
You can wait outside.
- What are you doing here?
- You put this in our letterbox.
- My parents think I'm a thief.
- You shouldn't be here.
Yes, I should.
And you should apologize.
Listen to me, you shouldn't be here.
This is just weird.
You have to leave.
- Stay here. Hey!
- No.
Hey...
- Hey, stop!
- Don't shout, people are sleeping.
If you apologize, I'll go.
Listen carefully to me...
I'm really sorry
if my letter caused you trouble.
This has nothing to do with you.
Please, let me finish...
It was nothing personal.
All I wanted was to get
my stuff back.
- What are you doing?
- Good night. Go now.
Stop!
Hey! Stop!
What are you doing?
Beat it!
- Hey!
- Stop this.
No. Apologize to me and my family!
Stop shouting!
Stop this and get out!
I will smack you one,
believe me.
I'm counting to three.
One, two...
Get out.
Get out!
Let's go inside.
What are you doing?
Don't do that!
Stop doing that!
Stop it!
You called me a thief,
so I'm making chaos with you!
Stop this...
No! Don't you...
- They're my neighbours! Get out!
- Help me!
- Hello? Hello?
- Beat it!
Why didn't you listen to me?
You should have listened.
Right? Now go home.
All right, go and brush your teeth.
Go on, brush your teeth...
Shoes off first.
Help!
Help!
- Hello?
- Help me...
Is there anyone here?
Hello?
Help!
Here we go... Yes.
Help me!
Help!
Help me...
Help!
Help me...
Help...
<i>The person you're trying to reach</i>
<i>is not available...</i>
Uh, hi...
You can probably see who this is.
We just met on my stairwell.
I tried to call,
but I couldn't get through.
So now I'm making
this video instead.
Because you're absolutely right.
I apologize for the rotten thing
I did.
I accused you
of being a thief.
Please show this
to your parents,
so they'll know you are
not a thief.
The note said you stole
my phone and my wallet,
but that wasn't true.
I want to emphasize
that this is simply not true.
So, I'd like to apologize.
It was a bad thing to do.
It was so selfish of me.
Careless and prejudiced
and I'm...
Looking back, I should have gone
into your building,
knocked on the doors
and asked a simple question.
But that never occurred to me,
because...
Well, honestly, I was too afraid.
Afraid of the people who live...
Afraid of the people I picture
living in a building like yours.
Those negative expectations
say something about me.
They say something
about our society,
because I'm sure I'm not
the only one who's prejudiced...
You have preconceptions
about us too,
probably because
our lives are so different.
So suddenly,
it comes down to politics
and the distribution of assets.
Because these problems can't be
solved by individuals alone.
Society needs to lend a hand too.
It's not enough
that I admit I was wrong
and apologize to you in a video.
There are bigger,
structural problems
involved that society needs
to deal with.
I actually know one of the 291 people
who own more than 50%
of the world's wealth.
A guy like that could fix
all this in an instant.
Welcome...
We have...
We have called
this press conference
in response to a certain video
circulating on the Internet.
We believe that it's the best way
to deal with your questions.
This session will be led by
our chief curator,
Christian Juel Nielsen.
Hello.
Well, as previously stated...
We are here to discuss
the video clip
published on the museum website
and on our YouTube channel.
We have received a massive
amount of messages
and indignant responses
with regard to this video,
and this pains us.
- Could you please speak up?
- Yes, certainly.
We're very sorry
to have caused this commotion,
particularly since this clip
was published by mistake.
This museum has clearly defined
procedures.
It's my role to supervise
all our communications
and marketing efforts.
In this particular case, I did
not fully comply with protocol,
and this video was published
without my knowledge.
I have acted
irresponsibly in this matter,
and have therefore,
in accord with our board,
decided to step down.
- Are you saying you're resigning?
- Yes.
- When?
- As soon as possible.
- Were you sacked?
- No, it was a unanimous decision.
We felt that it would be
the best solution.
Define "we".
That would be myself,
our management and our board.
Where is your solidarity
with the voiceless
and the vulnerable members
of society?
Where is your solidarity
with the voiceless
and the vulnerable members
of society?
You should be ashamed
of yourself!
That's total bullshit...
You started out by saying
that you and the museum board
agreed that you should resign.
Yes, that was our decision.
This is not the image
we wish to project.
So you've reached the limit
for how much freedom of speech
you can handle?
You've hit the ceiling
in terms of communication?
Do you personally believe
that you crossed a line?
I believe that freedom of speech
comes with certain responsibilities.
You must consider
what you express.
But is it up to you
to limit free speech?
Isn't such self-censorship
cause for concern?
- You're in a powerful position.
- The decision was not all mine.
But you took part in this decision.
You have clearly expressed
that this clip
was so distasteful that you feel
obligated to resign.
I made a mistake, the clip was
published without my approval.
So that's where you draw the line?
A fictional girl gets...
No, it isn't. Like I said,
this has nothing to do
with my own opinions.
You're putting a cap
on free speech!
These are not
my personal opinions.
We're talking about the museum
and my professional role.
What is it you don't
understand about that?
This is a highly alarming future
you're creating for our society.
Quite frankly, it sucks!
Christian... Christian?
I have questions
about the content of the clip.
How did the choice fall on
a blonde beggar girl exploding?
This just came
from the PR agency.
If you wanted to draw parallels
to the poverty in the EU,
why not have a dark-haired child?
How do you respond to that?
As I was trying to explain,
I have not dealt responsibly...
- Answer the question!
- I just received a message...
...that might shed
some light on this.
I hope so.
It's a statement from
our marketing department
and the agency we used.
"We want to emphasize
that the clip
published on the museum's
website and YouTube channel
in no way expresses
the standpoint of the museum."
"The clip was produced
in sheer speculation to generate
attention for
an upcoming exhibition."
- So, it's all speculation?
- What exhibition is that?
Will you be blowing up kids?
What kind of exhibition is it?
To best explain
the theme of the exhibition,
I'll quote the artist's
manifesto, which goes something
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."
- Could you repeat that?
- Quiet, let him talk.
"The Square is a sanctuary
of trust and caring.
Within it, we all share
equal rights and obligations."
- What's the name of the artist?
- Lola Arias.
- Repeat her last name, please.
- A-R-I-A-S.
All the press material
is on our website.
- Including photos of Lola Arias?
- Yes, in high-resolution.
Both of the artist
and of some of her work.
There is an extensive press kit
to download there.
Museum speculates in disgusting
details to grab attention
stand united against PR campaign
Here is the exhibition
they wanted to launch
<i>The coaches are
Therese Johansson,</i>
<i>Yasemin Beyasit,
and Josephine Kalmlund.</i>
<i>And here come the "Bobcats"!</i>
Great! Let's go for it!
Go, girls!
Hey, where are we going?
I'll explain in a minute.
Remember that boy who was waiting
for us the other night?
He lives over there.
I need to talk to him.
It will only take 10 minutes.
20, tops.
You don't mind
waiting in the car, do you?
Is that okay?
Daddy?
Daddy!
What is it?
Could we come along too?
- Well, if she wants to.
- Do you?
Sure, let's go.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.
Hello... Sorry to bother you.
My name is Christian.
This may sound a bit crazy,
but I was hoping...
Did you happen to get a letter
accusing you of being a thief?
Claiming that you stole
a phone and a wallet?
- Pardon?
- A letter.
Accusing you of being a thief.
- What did you say I got?
- A letter with a weird message.
- In my letterbox?
- Yes.
I put them through
all the slots in this building.
I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Could anyone else
in your household have found it?
My ex-wife comes around to clean.
She throws away any mail
that doesn't have my name on it.
I have one more question...
Are there any kids living
in this building?
- Sure, why do you ask?
- I'm looking for a boy.
He's, like, ten or twelve...
Pitch-black hair.
About this tall? Really dark hair...
- 10, 13, years old...
- That's right.
Does he live here?
He used to.
I haven't seen him around.
- The family used to live here?
- I think they moved.
I see...
- Do you know where they moved to?
- No, not a clue.
I'm afraid I can't help you.
- Okay.
- Bye.
