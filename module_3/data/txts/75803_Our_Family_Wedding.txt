<i>And that green one's for you,
whether you like it or not.</i>
<i>I don't like that.</i>
<i>- Do I need these?
- No.</i>
Come on. Come on.
<i>Why are you so scared?</i>
<i>Well, my parents don't know
I dropped out of law school,</i>
<i>and I'm living with a man
they've never met before. And...</i>
<i>We're adults about to get married
and start our life together.</i>
<i>Can't we just do that and not tell my dad?</i>
<i>yeah.</i>
<i>I promise you,
your parents are gonna love me.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, baby, but you blew that chance
when you had sex with me.</i>
<i>Is that you?
I think it's you.</i>
<i>It's mine.</i>
<i>- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, Pop.</i>
<i>This is your man Brad Boyd,
Hot 93.7 KZLY.</i>
<i>Don't forget the card, fellas.</i>
<i>Didn't matter if I had my chocolates in
one hand, my champagne in the other.</i>
<i>If I didn't come with
that Hallmark attached,</i>
<i>my ex-wife just flipped.</i>
<i>I never got that.
I guess that's why she's my ex.</i>
<i>- Hey.
Miguel.</i>
<i>- What?
- you cannot be this clueless.</i>
What, Sonia?
<i>Sonia?</i>
Honey?
<i>Brad Boyd, Brad Boyd,
B- squared on the radio,</i>
<i>spending time with you on The Love Hour.</i>
<i>Now Cupid's arrows
are pointing right at you,</i>
<i>playing music to hit your heartstrings.</i>
<i>Ow! Just hit you in the heart.</i>
<i>Happy Valentine's Day, people.</i>
Oh, shit!
<i>BOyD: So what are you doing tonight,
Los Angeles?</i>
<i>Are you with the one you love,
or are you loving the one you're with?</i>
<i>What am I doing tonight?</i>
<i>I'm gonna let some trouble find me.</i>
<i>I'm gonna be out at The Spot
signing autographs.</i>
<i>All you ladies out there
looking for a valentine,</i>
<i>Brad Boyd will be in the house.</i>
Hi.
<i>I'm Sienna.</i>
<i>- Brad Boyd.
- I know.</i>
<i>your voice is in my ear every night.</i>
<i>yeah, don't forget Brad Boyd is
in the building, y'all. Check him out.</i>
Wow.
<i>Babe, did you get that flower
I got for you last night?</i>
<i>Is...</i>
<i>I'm just gonna get some food
on the way to work.</i>
<i>Baby, can you help me?</i>
<i>Watch it. I got it, baby.
Oh, thank you.</i>
Thank you.
<i>Okay, what is that smell?
Is that you or is that me?</i>
<i>- you, since Colorado.
- Shut up.</i>
<i>you know, if we would've got
on a flight, we would have been here</i>
<i>- three days earlier.
- I don't wanna hear it!</i>
<i>- People die on planes!
People die on trains!</i>
<i>- They derail!
- How about this?</i>
How about we invite your dad
and my parents to a restaurant tonight?
<i>And then we can tell them all
at the same time, in a public place.</i>
<i>How about we stick to the plan,
do dinner at my dad's house tonight</i>
and brunch at your parents' tomorrow?
<i>Okay. All right, that's the plan.
It's a good plan.</i>
<i>We can stick to the plan.</i>
<i>And after I rent a car, we could get a hotel
and burn some time.</i>
<i>Hello?
- Hi, Daddy!</i>
<i>- Hey, sweetie, what are you doing?
- I'm on a train to LA right now.</i>
<i>- No, you're not.
- What a surprise!</i>
<i>I didn't think I was gonna get to see you
till spring break.</i>
<i>I was thinking we could maybe...
We could go to a restaurant tonight?</i>
<i>That's not the plan!</i>
<i>- Okay. See you.
- Okay, I'll text you the address.</i>
<i>- All right. I love you, Daddy. Bye.
- Bye, angel.</i>
Hey, your sister's coming
to dinner tonight.
<i>I know.
She called me, like, a couple of days ago.</i>
Dad, not at work.
<i>Why am I always the last person
to find things out in this family?</i>
<i>Manny called in sick, says he has shingles,</i>
<i>so I'm delivering the Bugatti
to Mr. Endicott.</i>
<i>We have a bunch of tow calls from LAPD,
so... I don't know what you wanna do.</i>
<i>Tell Jesse or Ramon.</i>
<i>They called in sick, too. Gout and scurvy.</i>
<i>Let me guess.
This is about the health coverage.</i>
<i>That's it. Give me the keys to
the other truck. I'll tow the cars myself.</i>
<i>All right. you know you don't pedal
with your feet anymore, right?</i>
Times have changed.
<i>And you have always
been my favorite son.</i>
Shut up.
Hey! Whoa!
<i>Oh, yeah, cool. Cool.</i>
<i>you know what? I could bring this girl...</i>
<i>No, there's this other one
I'm gonna bring...</i>
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, stop, stop!
That's my car! That's my car!
<i>you know what?
Just text me the address, all right?</i>
<i>Hey, man. I'm here. This is mine.</i>
<i>- I'm sorry, my man, but it's on the hook.
- No, no, no, look.</i>
<i>Look, it's not hooked up yet.
Look, you haven't hooked it yet.</i>
<i>yeah, it's...</i>
<i>- What? We cool, right?
- yeah, we're fine.</i>
<i>- All right, great. We're good.
- Okay.</i>
<i>Ah!</i>
<i>yes!</i>
<i>Ah- ha!</i>
<i>- It's on the hook, like I said.
- No, no, it wasn't.</i>
<i>It wasn't on the hook.
I got here before you had it on the hook.</i>
<i>you're gonna have to come claim your car.</i>
<i>What, you think I would trust this ride
with somebody like you?</i>
Excuse me?
<i>- What, you don't speak English now?
- We're speaking English, bro.</i>
<i>- I'm not your "bro," ese.
- And I'm not your '"ese, '"cuz.</i>
<i>I'm not your "cuz," vato.</i>
<i>- Bye.
- Cool. you see this?</i>
<i>you see it right now?
I got my hand on the doorknob.</i>
<i>you want to call a policeman?
Police! Police!</i>
<i>I got my hand on the doorknob.</i>
<i>you can't tow me
if I got my hand on the doorknob.</i>
<i>- you know the law, right?
- Here's where you get it.</i>
<i>- Hey, everybody! Can anybody see here?
- I'm towing the car.</i>
<i>I got my hand on the doorknob,
and he's trying to tow my car away!</i>
- Bye-bye.
- She saw! She saw it!
- Hey!
- Bye!
<i>No, no! Hey! This is my automobile!</i>
<i>- Hey! Hey! you see me? Look! Look!
- Bye!</i>
<i>Stop! I'm here!</i>
<i>Hey! you see me? I know you see...</i>
<i>Hey. you see my hand on the knob, right?
you'll testify, right?</i>
Hey! Hey!
This is my car!
Hey. Thanks.
<i>I knew I could depend on you.</i>
<i>Mmm-mmm.</i>
<i>- Come on.
- Get in the back.</i>
<i>- Come on, Angie.
- No.</i>
<i>- Angie.
- you're on punishment.</i>
<i>Fine. Fine, you want to be my chauffeur?
No problem. Okay.</i>
<i>Come on, James. I rarely get out, all right?</i>
<i>And when I do, it's for these radio events.</i>
<i>And the women there are young.</i>
<i>Okay? I said they're young,
and they love my voice.</i>
<i>As your lawyer,
I suggest you curb this habit</i>
before you wake up on the wrong side
of some pissed-off daddy's shotgun.
<i>I'm human, Angie.
What you want me to do?</i>
<i>- you should let me set you up.
- Uh-uh. No more veterans.</i>
<i>And what is a veteran?</i>
<i>- you know.
- No, I don't.</i>
<i>Bitter, older women who've been
messed over by so many men</i>
<i>that they're twisted up like war vets.</i>
<i>They wake up in the middle
of the night screaming,</i>
<i>trying to choke you in your sleep.</i>
<i>They get their little tweezers out and
they're stabbing you in the heart, going...</i>
<i>"you know you did it.
you know you did it. "</i>
<i>Slow down.</i>
<i>you already hooked me up
with the unmentionable.</i>
<i>- I don't wanna say her name, so...
- Oh, no.</i>
<i>- you begged me to hook you up with...
- Hey.</i>
<i>- Don't...
- If it wasn't for me...</i>
<i>- you know we got a rule.
... setting you up with...</i>
<i>- Do not say that name.
... Cheryl.</i>
Oh!
<i>Man, I know.</i>
<i>I'm working on it, I'm working on it.</i>
<i>If it wasn't for Cheryl, you wouldn't
have Marcus, and he turned out wonderful.</i>
<i>And that's a surprise,
seeing he was raised by your crazy butt.</i>
<i>Luckily, he had me around
to watch his back.</i>
<i>What would you do if you didn't have me
here to rescue you, huh?</i>
<i>you'd be standing
on the side of the road.</i>
<i>All true. See,</i>
<i>this way, you're the only woman
I need in my life.</i>
<i>- Oh, God.
- Thanks, babe.</i>
<i>- See you later.
- Bye.</i>
<i>- Okay. How do I look?
- you look fine.</i>
<i>Hey, you know those cufflinks you
made me, the ones with the little fishes?</i>
Mmm-hmm.
Do you know where they are?
<i>- Hey, I looked in there.
- Of course you did.</i>
<i>I can't wait for you to see the car
for Lucia's graduation gift.</i>
<i>It's the best work I've ever done.</i>
Hey. Reservation for Boyd.
- Just a moment.
- Okay, thanks.
<i>So, we're gonna tell them
everything, right?</i>
<i>- Babe?
- yes.</i>
<i>Good. Now, show the twins a little bit.
Come on.</i>
<i>All right, that's gross.</i>
<i>- Hi, Izzy.
- Hi.</i>
<i>I'm hungry.</i>
<i>Iz, this is Marcus.
Marcus, this is my sister, Isabel.</i>
<i>- Hey.
- you look better than your picture.</i>
<i>- I like your face.
- Thanks, and you...</i>
<i>And your fingernails
are nice and manicured. It's nice.</i>
<i>- Okay, enough.
- Cute.</i>
<i>Can you give us one real quick,
just a minute?</i>
<i>yeah.</i>
<i>What?
- Have you told Dad about him yet?</i>
<i>- No, that's why we're here.
- This is gonna be so good.</i>
<i>- Mom! Hi!
- Oh, my God! Look at you!</i>
<i>- Mi hija, you are so grown up!
No, she's not!</i>
<i>I missed you so much.
you look great, sweetheart.</i>
<i>Excuse me, sir,
we're having a family moment here...</i>
Dad. Mom. This is Marcus.
Hey.
Oh. Oh!
Oh, this is Marcus?
<i>- you know about a Marcus?
- I...</i>
<i>Mrs. Ramirez, it's a pleasure to meet you.</i>
<i>Thank you. Call me Sonia.</i>
<i>And this is my dad, Miguel.</i>
<i>Call me Mr. Ramirez.</i>
<i>Sir, I've heard so much about you.</i>
<i>I can't say the same.</i>
<i>- I missed you.
- your table is ready.</i>
<i>- Oh, good.
- Good.</i>
<i>- Are you hungry?
Marcus.</i>
<i>- We should eat something.
- yeah.</i>
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>
<i>Look, honey, I need to call and
see what's taking my dad so long.</i>
<i>- I'll meet you.
Okay.</i>
<i>- There he is. What's up, Pops?
- Hey.</i>
Oh.
<i>- I missed you. you look good.
- you do, too.</i>
Thanks.
Hey!
<i>Oh. Miguel, we left the wine in the car.</i>
<i>Miguel. Wine. In the car. Go.</i>
Oh.
<i>I'm sorry. I'll be right black.</i>
<i>I didn't know her folks were coming.</i>
<i>yeah, I just figured
you would bring Angela.</i>
<i>I thought this was a date thing,
not a family thing.</i>
<i>Lucia, this is my father,
Bradford Boyd.</i>
- Brad.
- Hi, so nice to meet you.
<i>So you're the one that
my son keeps talking so much about.</i>
<i>- This is my sister, Isabel.
- Izzy.</i>
Okay.
<i>- And my mother, Sonia.
- Hi. Thank you.</i>
<i>Where's your dad?</i>
<i>He went to the car
to get some wine.</i>
Hi.
<i>- Ashley?
- Lucy?</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>What the heck?</i>
- Hi!
- Hi!
<i>- How long has it been?
- I don't know, like, seven years.</i>
<i>Mom, you remember Ashley.
We played softball together.</i>
- Hi.
- Hi.
<i>- What are you doing here?
- I'm with Brad.</i>
<i>you are?</i>
<i>yes, I am.</i>
<i>Whoa. My phone is buzzing.</i>
Wow. Can you give me a...
Excuse me for a second.
Okay, baby.
<i>Well, this is just... I mean, this is beautiful.</i>
<i>- Let's sit.
- Okay.</i>
<i>yes.</i>
<i>I was saving this
for a very special occasion,</i>
<i>but I guess this will do.</i>
<i>Hey, Dad, you remember Ashley, right?
From Lucia's softball team.</i>
<i>- yeah. Catcher, right?
- yeah, that's good. Good.</i>
<i>- Good memory.
- So Lucia invited you, too?</i>
<i>Actually, Daddy, she's here
with Marcus' father. His date.</i>
- 'Cause they're dating. Each other.
- He gets it.
Okay, you just missed him.
<i>Waiter, I need this bottle opened now.</i>
<i>- Not a problem, sir.
- Thank you.</i>
<i>And this is Marcus' father, Brad.</i>
<i>you? you towed my car!</i>
<i>There was a sign. you can't read?</i>
<i>I graduated USC magna cum laude.</i>
<i>- Marcus, do something.
Keep your voice down.</i>
<i>Brother.
- "Brother"? I'm not your brother, hombre.</i>
<i>- '"Hombre, '"really?
- Dad.</i>
- Dad! Dad! Dad!
- Dad!
<i>- What is wrong with you people?
- "you people"?</i>
<i>This is not the place!</i>
<i>you wanna say it, don't you?
Go ahead and say it.</i>
<i>Embarrass yourself in front of
your daughter. Go ahead and say it.</i>
- Say the word.
- He's a jerk.
<i>- Look, Dad.
- yes.</i>
What's going on?
How do you even know each other?
<i>He parked in a "No Parking" zone.</i>
<i>He towed my car.
I had my hand on the knob.</i>
Hand on the knob!
How many times have we heard...
<i>This is not the place.</i>
Hey! Hey!
<i>Okay. Let's just calm down
and have a seat. Please.</i>
<i>Please.</i>
<i>- Please.
- you first.</i>
<i>No. you first.</i>
Oh, no, no, no, you first.
<i>- No, no, no, I insist.
- What?</i>
<i>Oh, God. I insist, please!</i>
<i>- No, you...
- Boys.</i>
Sit.
Of course.
<i>- Pop.
- Just straightening my tie.</i>
<i>you know what I think?
I think it's amazing.</i>
<i>I think that your dad towed his car,</i>
and your dad thinks
her dad said something racist,
and you're here with me.
<i>I just think this is meant to be.
I think it's absolutely incredible.</i>
<i>And it just connects all of us, it's...
I think this is fate.</i>
<i>Wow. you know
you just said that out loud.</i>
<i>Okay. Let's start this night over.</i>
<i>We can sit and have a lovely dinner
and enjoy getting to know each other.</i>
<i>That's the point of this whole thing, right?</i>
<i>Actually, the point of all this
is to let you know that... Ow! Ow!</i>
We're hungry.
<i>- Let's eat.
- yeah.</i>
<i>I hear the gnocchi's
really good here.</i>
<i>- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking at my menu.</i>
We're getting married.
- What?
- What?
<i>- What?
- yep.</i>
We are.
<i>yay.</i>
So sweet.
<i>Marcus is volunteering
for Doctors Without Borders for a year,</i>
<i>and he leaves in three weeks.</i>
<i>So we wanted to do it before that,
before he leaves to Laos.</i>
<i>Laos? Like Los Angeles? Las Vegas?</i>
<i>Just Laos. Daddy, it's near Thailand.</i>
Wait, wait, wait.
<i>What's the rush? I mean, unless there's
something that you two need to tell us...</i>
<i>- Oh, God, you're pregnant!
- Lucia!</i>
<i>No. What? No! No! Dad.</i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>I'm not pregnant.</i>
<i>That would be impossible.</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Impossible?</i>
Mmm-hmm.
<i>- Impossible's good.
- Good.</i>
<i>Impossible's good! It's good!</i>
<i>BOyD: Impossible's good.
That's a good thing.</i>
Very proud of you.
<i>We know this may all seem rushed,
but it just felt right, you know?</i>
<i>I couldn't leave without her.</i>
<i>And I can't just let him
leave without me, so...</i>
<i>Wait, wait, wait.
you're going with him to Sri Lanka?</i>
<i>Laos. It's near Thailand.</i>
<i>What about...
What about your law degree?</i>
<i>Well,</i>
<i>it's not gonna affect it at all.
I checked. I did the research.</i>
<i>Foreign exchange law classes
at the University of Laos?</i>
<i>- Is there even a University of Laos?
- yes, I checked.</i>
Baby.
Bye.
<i>What, you couldn't get the tow truck
down here fast enough to tow it?</i>
Hey, Brad. Watch your head.
- Bye, you guys.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
<i>you'll be hearing from my lawyer.</i>
<i>I just don't like lying.</i>
<i>Look, I promise, when things calm down,
I will tell them.</i>
<i>I'll see you at home.</i>
<i>Hello, mi hija.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>
<i>yeah. I'm great.</i>
<i>After the way Dad acted.</i>
<i>you just surprised him, that's all.
Just give him a little time.</i>
<i>Marcus is a really good guy, Mom.</i>
Mmm-hmm.
<i>He wants to do really good things
in this world.</i>
<i>And what do you want?</i>
<i>I want the same thing.</i>
<i>Then you're lucky.</i>
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>- Good morning.
- Good morning, angel, hey.</i>
<i>Is Marcus still coming?</i>
<i>- yep.
- Good.</i>
Hi, Mama.
Come here, come here.
<i>Let me see.</i>
Oh, my goodness, you make me so happy.
<i>Just wait till you meet him.</i>
<i>I made you your favorite breakfast,
chorizito con huevos.</i>
<i>Gotta fatten you up for your babies.</i>
<i>- you look about ready, gordita.
- Shut up, flaca.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!
- Watch it.</i>
<i>Isabel, again no makeup.</i>
<i>- How do you expect to find a husband?
- I'm not looking.</i>
<i>- you wanna stay a spinister all your life?
Spinster.</i>
Sounds better than being trapped
by some guy
<i>who expects me to cook
and clean and have babies</i>
<i>while he sits around getting fat.</i>
<i>Not you, Dad.</i>
<i>What's the rush?
At the age you're at right now,</i>
<i>you supposed to be lining them up
like bowling pins and knocking them over.</i>
<i>- Look here. Congratulations, all right?
- Thank you.</i>
<i>Do not listen to these fools.</i>
<i>Marriage, it's a beautiful thing.</i>
<i>I mean, once you find that combination</i>
- between trust and commitment...
Oh, yeah.
<i>...it's like the doors just fly open...
- Just beautiful.</i>
<i>Trusting thing. Loving thing.</i>
<i>you know how much
his woman trusts him?</i>
<i>Lauryn call him every 10 minutes.
That's how much she trusts him.</i>
<i>Well, looky, looky.</i>
<i>BOyD: Greg, just go ahead
and answer it, okay?</i>
<i>We're cool. We're just gonna wait.
We're cool.</i>
<i>No, I don't need to.</i>
<i>Don't move it away. Come on, man.
The phone's got GPS.</i>
<i>It's cool. We don't have a problem with it.</i>
<i>- Pick it up. Go ahead.
- Don't try to act tough for us.</i>
<i>- I'm not trying to act tough.
Okay, okay.</i>
<i>Go ahead. It's really, really, really...</i>
<i>Don't tell me to answer.
I won't answer the phone.</i>
<i>I don't need to answer the phone.</i>
<i>you see? There. Phone stopped ringing.</i>
<i>Did I answer it? No. Why?</i>
<i>Because that's how I...</i>
<i>That's how I get down.</i>
<i>"Get down"?
- Okay?</i>
<i>Now as I was saying,
when two people come...</i>
<i>- Great.
- Look, answer the phone, man,</i>
<i>because she's just gonna put you
on lockdown,</i>
it's gonna mess up our nights.
<i>No, we don't have lockdown
in my household.</i>
<i>They have marital Guantanamo.</i>
<i>Look. So she checks up on me
every once in a while?</i>
<i>Ankle bracelet.</i>
<i>So what? you know what I get in return?</i>
<i>Sex on the regular. It is so nice. Sex...</i>
<i>When was the last time
you had sex on the regular?</i>
<i>- Sex on the regular?
- On the regular.</i>
<i>Ain't all about quantity.
It's all about quality.</i>
<i>Well, just because you pay for it
doesn't make it quality.</i>
<i>I'm killing them today.</i>
<i>y'all can laugh all y'all want, man.
Ain't no shame in my game, baby.</i>
<i>- Brad, you know how I get down.
- I do.</i>
<i>- And my girl, Peaches...
- Peaches is a...</i>
<i>She is a professional.</i>
<i>- Peaches.
- If you don't pick that phone up,</i>
<i>you're gonna be asking me
for Peaches' phone number.</i>
Okay, so what happens
if you don't answer it?
<i>What?
What happens... What?</i>
<i>If you don't pick it up?</i>
<i>- Well, nothing happens.
- Five, four...</i>
<i>- I'm a man, that's what happens.
... three...</i>
<i>- It means she steps off.
- Two...</i>
<i>She knows. She knows who wears
the pants in this relationship.</i>
One...
<i>Oh, you must have forgotten
what happened in Cancun last year.</i>
<i>- Hey, honeypie. What's up?
- "Hey, honeypie. "</i>
<i>No, we weren't talking about you. No.</i>
What's that song that Babyface made
a few years ago?
<i>I'm not talking in my high voice.</i>
<i>you know, I'm just happy to hear from you.</i>
Hey.
<i>Guys, give him a break.</i>
<i>They're clowning me.
No, they didn't call you a clown.</i>
<i>you see that, right? That could be you.</i>
<i>- No. No, Lucia's not like that.
- Not yet.</i>
<i>you don't really know what she's like.</i>
<i>Wait, where's all this coming from?
I thought you liked her.</i>
<i>you saw her dad.</i>
<i>you saw her family.</i>
<i>Are you just tripping
'cause she's not black?</i>
<i>All I'm saying is that
you don't know the deal</i>
<i>until you say, "I do. "</i>
<i>And that ring on your finger,
that's about the realness.</i>
<i>I wanna make sure that
you're doing it at the right time</i>
and that you're not rushing things.
<i>Love can't tell time. I gotta go.</i>
Where you going?
<i>Pop, I already told you.
I'm meeting her family for brunch.</i>
<i>I miss her, I can't wait to see her. All right.</i>
There goes another one.
<i>you scared him away.</i>
<i>you're scaring the white people.</i>
- Hey.
- Hey.
Ready?
<i>- yeah. you ready?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>
<i>All right.</i>
<i>- Abuela.
- yeah?</i>
This is Marcus.
Ma'am...
<i>- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?</i>
<i>- I'm just trying to help.
Get up.</i>
Come on.
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>- Marcus.
- Mr. Ramirez.</i>
<i>Hey, I'm headed off to the store
to get some eggs. Why don't you join me?</i>
<i>Miguel, we have plenty of eggs.
- Sure.</i>
<i>No. One can never have too many eggs.</i>
<i>- Mr. Ramirez, I know we just met...
- Miguel. Miguel.</i>
<i>It's Miguel. Call me Miguel.</i>
<i>- Miguel, weren't you...
- No.</i>
<i>No. Mr. Ramirez.</i>
<i>Mr. Ramirez,
weren't you and Mrs. Ramirez young</i>
when you got married?
<i>yeah, we were, but I was respectful.
I talked to her father first,</i>
<i>so he could get to know
the measure of the man I am.</i>
Oh.
<i>I'm sorry.
I didn't even think about that.</i>
<i>- Do people still do that?
- If they value family.</i>
<i>I do.</i>
<i>I do, absolutely, sir. Absolutely.</i>
That's good to hear.
<i>I'm sure you and your wife would enjoy
time to get to know me a little better.</i>
<i>I wish there was a way
to accelerate the process</i>
of getting to know someone, you know?
<i>yeah.</i>
There's the grocery store.
<i>It's like you were saying, a really quick
and easy way to find out who you are.</i>
<i>It's pretty simple. All you gotta do
is put your thumb on that scanner pad,</i>
- and that's it. Right, Turman?
- That's right.
<i>I'm gonna run your prints for the basics,
prison record, warrants, sexual offenses...</i>
<i>Come on, really?</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>Ramirez Towing is one
of LAPD's biggest vendors, so...</i>
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>you know, if I loved someone
as much as you say you love her,</i>
<i>and I had nothing to hide, I would do it.</i>
<i>I've got nothing to hide.
So for me, personally, it's easy.</i>
See that?
<i>you know what? you're right.
Whatever it takes to win you over.</i>
<i>Oh! Slow your roll
before you lose your soul.</i>
<i>Let me walk you through it.</i>
Step back.
<i>you're done.</i>
<i>Laos? you know,
there's a lot of sick kids in America.</i>
<i>Why don't you help them?</i>
<i>Look, I know healthcare sucks for our poor,</i>
<i>but there are places in the world
where kids have no access to medical care.</i>
<i>Whoa. Hello. Guys, we got a problem.</i>
<i>There's a warrant for your arrest for failure
to appear on a public nudity charge.</i>
<i>- Bill!
yeah.</i>
We got us a perv.
That's disgusting.
<i>Miguel, I'm talking about you.
you got an outstanding warrant from 1984.</i>
<i>What? No! No!</i>
<i>I was 19. We were having fun,
and we were drunk and...</i>
<i>I mean, no, no, no. We were not drunk,
'cause that would be illegal.</i>
<i>- We were high... No! We were not high!
- I'd stop talking if I was you.</i>
<i>Okay. I'm not talking.</i>
Wow.
<i>- I'm good, right?
- For now.</i>
<i>Hey, man, have a great time in Laos.</i>
<i>- Thanks.
- yeah.</i>
<i>Miguel, please do not ruin this for her.</i>
<i>He is in love and he wants to get married.
What's wrong with that?</i>
<i>Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.</i>
<i>- Look at us.
- Look at us.</i>
Just because our marriages didn't work,
that doesn't make marriage a bad thing.
Oh.
<i>So are you saying that
you'd actually like to do it again?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
Come on. Why are you trying...
<i>you are crazy. you know that?</i>
<i>I'm not crazy. I just like things
to make sense. Is that okay?</i>
<i>Well, life doesn't always
make sense, Bradford.</i>
<i>And love doesn't always make sense.
I don't think that's such a bad thing.</i>
<i>Wow, Angie. That is so deep.</i>
<i>I'm so happy that you followed me to
Los Angeles for that little tidbit of advice.</i>
<i>"Followed you"? Don't flatter yourself.</i>
<i>'Cause I needed somebody
to be here and school me.</i>
<i>Do a little step for me.</i>
Mmm-hmm.
<i>Am I gonna have lots of fun.</i>
<i>Are you trying to touch my booty?</i>
<i>I did? Is that your butt?</i>
<i>All right, I'll be back.</i>
- Oh, oh!
- Stop!
<i>I took care of your suspension.
I brought it in on the flatbed.</i>
<i>I even fixed the little knob there
on the gear shift.</i>
<i>It was kind of tricky on the '65,</i>
- but on the '66, they fixed them.
- But on the '66, they fixed them.
Wow.
<i>- Thank you.
- you're welcome.</i>
<i>- Is that a scratch?
- What?</i>
- There's a scratch right here on my hood.
- There's no scratch.
There was no scratch on my hood
before you towed it.
<i>- you're saying I scratched your car?
- you scratched my car!</i>
<i>I did not scratch your car!
How would I scratch</i>
<i>- the top of your car?
- Were you trying to slip it by me?</i>
<i>- I was underneath the car.
- What is wrong with you?</i>
<i>Wait, wait. Pop! Pop! Pop!
There's nothing there.</i>
<i>Look, it's a smudge. Look. See?</i>
- See, there's no scratch.
- There's no scratch.
There's no scratch, sweetheart.
There's no scratch.
<i>Look, why don't we just all go inside
and relax?</i>
<i>- I need to use your bathroom.
- Sorry.</i>
<i>But the guest bathroom, I'm renovating it.</i>
<i>you might have to hold it
till you get home.</i>
<i>And that's the only bathroom you have
in your whole house?</i>
That guests get to use, yes.
<i>Mr. Ramirez, I'll show you the bathroom.
It's upstairs to the left.</i>
<i>I guess a few years after him, I moved
here to practice entertainment law.</i>
<i>Angela's like my aunt.</i>
<i>Well, more than my aunt.
She helped raise me.</i>
Okay.
What?
Mmm.
<i>Really?</i>
So your mother is where?
We were divorced when he was five.
<i>I fought for custody, and I got it.</i>
She didn't fight back.
<i>yes.</i>
Come on. Come on!
Stop!
Oh.
<i>All righty. So, we were thinking
March 3rd for the wedding.</i>
<i>It's in two weeks. Nothing big. Easy.</i>
<i>yeah, we wanted to do something small,
just the people in this room and her sister.</i>
<i>yeah,
Izzy would be there, of course.</i>
<i>No.</i>
<i>No?
- No, no, no.</i>
<i>- No?
- No.</i>
<i>- What do you mean, "no"?
- No. I mean, no.</i>
<i>It should be something special. Like, it
should be a traditional Mexican wedding.</i>
Too badwe're just one mexican short.
Here we go.
<i>No disrespect, Mrs. Ramirez,</i>
<i>but I think that both the cultures
have to be represented.</i>
<i>I mean, we have a lot of
African-American wedding traditions</i>
<i>that are great and we should explore them.</i>
<i>Like what?</i>
<i>I can't believe you forgot, Angie.
you know, jumping the broom.</i>
<i>- One.
- We could do that.</i>
<i>- yeah. yeah.
That's fun.</i>
<i>Dancing. We like to do the electric slide
when we...</i>
<i>- No.
... actually have our weddings.</i>
<i>I like. That's a nice one.</i>
<i>you must have your dance routines.</i>
<i>your merengues, your salsas,
your Macarenas.</i>
<i>And singing.</i>
<i>We like to do the negro song.
The national black song.</i>
<i>The Negro National Anthem.</i>
<i>you know the song.</i>
<i>Lift every voice and sing</i>
<i>- Marcus.
- No.</i>
<i>Till earth and heaven ring</i>
<i>Ring with the...</i>
<i>- Stop.
- Pop.</i>
<i>Let our rejoicing rise</i>
<i>Dad!
- Brad!</i>
- Dad! Hey!
- Can you stop?
<i>- Tell him to stop, too.
Pop!</i>
Brad, come on!
<i>Dad.
Pop.</i>
<i>- Hey.
- Will you stop?</i>
Stop. Stop.
Stop.
<i>Dad.</i>
Stop.
<i>Cool.</i>
<i>Look, I think that we could incorporate
all of these things.</i>
<i>We can think about making the wedding
a little bigger.</i>
<i>No. No, we can't afford that.</i>
<i>She's saying that in the Mexican tradition,
the padrinos, or the godparents basically,</i>
pay for the wedding.
But since there are none, in this case,
that it's up to the father of the groom
to pay for the wedding.
- That's tradition.
- Mmm.
<i>you got to be joking.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, but I just...</i>
<i>Look, if it's too hard to handle... I mean,
if you don't have the money, I understand.</i>
Just try to be a man about it.
<i>- Excuse me?
- No, not "excuse me. "</i>
<i>Say, "I'm cheap. Can't do it. "</i>
<i>Fine, it's handled. I'll pay for it.
Don't worry, it will be big and Mexican.</i>
<i>We'll have my cousins come over.
They're gonna speak Spanish.</i>
<i>you know, the ones that act so Mexican
they embarrass us.</i>
<i>Wait. We have two families,
the simplest thing is to split the cost.</i>
<i>Okay, hello. Hey.</i>
<i>What about us? It's our wedding.
What about what we want?</i>
Four words.
"Our marriage, their wedding. "
<i>- But I'm just saying that...
- Repeat after me, "Our marriage... "</i>
- Our marriage.
- Our marriage.
"... their wedding. "
- Their wedding.
- Their wedding.
<i>Great. So, I suggest we go with a DJ
instead of a band.</i>
<i>Oh, we could save money on that.</i>
<i>I got a crate-full of
Tower of Power records.</i>
Dad.
<i>- I'll handle the DJ.
- That's a good idea.</i>
<i>Okay, that still leaves the venue.</i>
Why don't we just have it here?
<i>- BOyD: What?
- yes!</i>
<i>yes.
BOyD: No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>No, that's a great idea. This place is
perfect for a small wedding and reception.</i>
<i>yeah, and we can set the tables
on the lawn,</i>
<i>and we can float candles in the pool.</i>
<i>And release doves.</i>
- Oh.
- Doves?
Do you know that
there's acid in dove droppings?
<i>Do you know what that does
to wooden lawn furniture?</i>
<i>It puts little, bitty spots
all over the furniture.</i>
<i>Dad, I know how you care about the crib,</i>
<i>but it would mean a lot to us
to have the wedding here.</i>
<i>No doves.</i>
<i>No doves, all right.</i>
<i>Mom, I like these.</i>
<i>Iz, which ones do you like more?</i>
<i>- Hello?
- Helpful.</i>
<i>What? Watch it, man.
you're gonna break the door.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, man.
I think I got the address wrong.</i>
Do you know which house is Brad Boyd's?
<i>I'm Brad Boyd. This is my house.</i>
<i>Are you sure?</i>
<i>yeah, last time I checked.</i>
<i>I supposed to build an altar
for Lucia's wedding.</i>
<i>Are you sure it's your house?</i>
<i>What? What? It can't be my house?</i>
<i>What... What are you trying to say?
Go ahead and say it.</i>
<i>Nothing, bro.</i>
<i>Oh! I get it.</i>
<i>I was in a really serene place.
I was doing my morning meditations.</i>
<i>I'm sitting out here.
you got people running all over my house.</i>
<i>My uncle Manny
works construction during the week.</i>
<i>So if we want it for free,
it's gonna be on his off hours.</i>
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down.</i>
<i>That vase, that's a Bauer.
It's very expensive.</i>
<i>I can't believe it. This is ridiculous...</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>Sonia, thanks for
this wonderful seating board.</i>
<i>Schematic. A seating schematic.</i>
<i>All right. Well, trust me when I say
the seating schematic</i>
<i>is the most important and complicated
aspect of this process.</i>
<i>How we arrange these tables</i>
<i>can be the difference between
a day to cherish and a hellish oblivion.</i>
<i>- Good.
- BOyD: Okay. I'll start.</i>
<i>I put my mom, my brother, his wife,</i>
my two nephews, my dad and step mom
<i>from St. Louis at Table Number 3.</i>
<i>Oh. Hey, Earlene.
you still screwing my husband?</i>
<i>- I'm not your husband, woman.
- yes, you are.</i>
<i>We never got a divorce.
We're just legally separated.</i>
<i>you never got a divorce?</i>
<i>Baby, it's been 35 years. I think there's
a statute of limitations or something.</i>
<i>- you never got a divorce?
- Alzheimer's.</i>
<i>- you lied to me.
- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Still the other woman.
How does it feel?</i>
<i>I'll show you how it feels!</i>
<i>Told you it's gonna be tricky.</i>
<i>How about we put your mom
and your nephews at Table 9?</i>
<i>BOyD: My brother, he's a big mama's boy.
He can't be far away from my mom.</i>
Mama. Mama!
<i>- What are you calling your mother for?
- Mama.</i>
<i>Sonia, why don't you put your
Aunt Rosita and Uncle Juan at Table 6,</i>
<i>and, Brad, you can put your mom
and the kids there as well.</i>
<i>Oh, you must be
with the black groom's family.</i>
<i>I know this because you are black.</i>
Oh! What was that?
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no. you cannot sit
Cousin Jaime near any women.</i>
<i>Oh. Well, in that case, can we move
my friends next to Marcus' frat brothers?</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>
<i>My boys get a little rowdy
when they drink.</i>
<i>So do my girls.</i>
Okay. What about Raymond?
<i>I thought he was in prison.</i>
<i>Paroled last month.</i>
<i>What the fuck you looking at, holmes?</i>
Mom!
<i>Table 8, Table 8.</i>
<i>yeah, the officers from Rampart.</i>
<i>yeah. That's good, that's good.</i>
<i>What about Marcus' mom? your ex?</i>
What?
Okay.
<i>- Oh, my.
This way, ladies.</i>
Okay. Thank you.
<i>Ladies, welcome.</i>
<i>Oh, my God. Lucia, look at this.</i>
<i>- And look at this one.
- Okay.</i>
<i>Let's begin our journey with a picture.</i>
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.
<i>Hey, Luce,
I've been meaning to ask you...</i>
<i>Smile for the before.</i>
<i>...is it true what they say
about black guys?</i>
<i>Why ask a question when you know
the answer, pinche puta?</i>
<i>Spanish is such a romantic language.</i>
<i>- Isn't it?
- It is.</i>
<i>Okay. It's time to pick out some gowns.</i>
<i>Mi hija, look.</i>
Magnificent.
Maybe.
Bravo.
<i>Stay still.</i>
<i>Beautiful.</i>
<i>- Look good?
- Very nice.</i>
Whoa.
Excuse me. Why is his white?
He has to be distinctive with the bride.
<i>Oh, I see.</i>
<i>Sorry, but I'm the father of the groom.</i>
<i>I'm distinctive, and I would like to have
a white dinner jacket, as well.</i>
<i>you cannot. you have to stay in the black.</i>
<i>That's how it's going to be uniform.
Just like that.</i>
Our marriage, their wedding.
<i>Look, Pops, just wear the black tux.
It's classic.</i>
<i>What's the matter, Brad?
you don't like black?</i>
<i>Black is always classy.</i>
<i>you know what they say,
"Once you go black... "</i>
<i>your credit goes bad.</i>
What did you say?
Come out and enjoy the inauguration of
<i>the most important dress
you will ever wear.</i>
Oh.
<i>Careful. Take a look.</i>
- Mom?
- What?
What are you doing?
<i>- It is so pretty.
- Mom!</i>
Oh.
<i>I just...
I thought I'd try some things on with you.</i>
<i>you know, to save time.</i>
Our marriage, their wedding.
That's cute.
<i>Izzy, where's your dress?</i>
<i>I wasn't really feeling it.</i>
<i>you weren't feeling it?</i>
<i>- Well, did you even try it on?
- Sure.</i>
<i>What's wrong with this dress? I like it.</i>
<i>Then you wear it.
Since when do you like pink?</i>
<i>It's not pink. It's lavender rose.</i>
<i>- yeah, whatever.
- What the hell is your problem, Izzy?</i>
<i>you're supposed to be my maid of honor.</i>
<i>I never asked to be your maid of honor.</i>
<i>you're my sister, okay?
That's what sisters do.</i>
<i>I vow to not get married young
like yessenia or Letti...</i>
<i>Always pregnant
or getting pregnant,</i>
never dreaming of anything better.
<i>I know the pact. Okay?</i>
<i>I fell in love.</i>
<i>It changes things.</i>
But it doesn't change who you are.
<i>you don't think Mom told herself that?</i>
<i>- Do you think she's happy?
- yes.</i>
<i>I mean, what the hell does she do all day?</i>
<i>- Her jewelry.
- yeah. Okay, sure.</i>
<i>If she's not taking care of Dad.</i>
<i>And when do you think is the last time
he did something nice for her?</i>
<i>I bet you that dinner the other night</i>
was their first night out in a decade.
<i>And you saw the way she was looking
at the vibrator in the lingerie store.</i>
<i>She probably thought
it was a food mixer or something.</i>
<i>No, it was like she saw water in a desert.</i>
Okay. Stop. That's disgusting.
<i>I swear, you get pregnant
before you're 30, I'm gonna kick your ass.</i>
<i>Look, Izzy, I'm not Mom.</i>
<i>yeah, all right.
We'll check back with you in 25 years.</i>
<i>I'll cook your dinner, too</i>
<i>Oh, baby</i>
<i>Soon as I get home from work</i>
<i>I'll pay your rent</i>
<i>What?</i>
<i>What? Why are you laughing?</i>
<i>My dad's friends were singing this song
to me 'cause they say I'm whipped.</i>
<i>Really?</i>
<i>They just don't know what I got.</i>
<i>Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt</i>
<i>Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home from work</i>
<i>All right, keep your eyes closed
just for two more seconds.</i>
<i>Come on, Miguel, I got like
a thousand other things to do.</i>
<i>yeah, I know, but I just wanted you
to see Lucia's present.</i>
<i>Look.</i>
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>- Is this your old ride?
- yeah.</i>
Sexy, isn't it?
<i>I just finished it this morning.
you like the new color?</i>
<i>- Pink?
- yeah. Come on, get in.</i>
Ooh. Wow.
<i>Aw.</i>
We had some good times in this car.
<i>yeah, we did.</i>
Mmm.
Wanna have some more good times
in this car?
<i>yep. Oh, no, not now. No.</i>
<i>- Come on, nobody's looking.
- No, no.</i>
<i>It's the garage. No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>'Cause it's where I... Oh!</i>
<i>- Down here. That's fine.
That's not what I meant.</i>
<i>I mean, get off, not get on.</i>
<i>Really?
- I was trying to get away from you.</i>
<i>you guys are old. That's disgusting.</i>
<i>No, it's not what it looks like.</i>
<i>I'm looking at the rusty muffler
from under here...</i>
<i>yeah, I bet it's rusty.</i>
<i>No, really, it's...</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey. you don't touch
another man's grill. Give me that.</i>
<i>So, Marcus, are you Catholic?</i>
<i>Technically, I'm Baptist,
but I'm not really into organized religion.</i>
<i>But he believes in God. Right, baby?</i>
<i>yeah. I just don't go to church.</i>
He's a heathen.
<i>She's just saying that traditional Mexican
weddings are traditionally Catholic.</i>
<i>Well, we were thinking about
something a little less traditional.</i>
<i>- Right, Luce?
- Mmm.</i>
We were just thinking about it.
<i>Like what?</i>
<i>- This woman know how to cook?
- No.</i>
<i>But it's no big deal. My Pops taught me.</i>
<i>your Pops taught you?</i>
<i>So, Lucia, your dad was telling me
that you are at Columbia Law.</i>
Mmm-hmm.
<i>- Dean's list.
Great school.</i>
<i>you planning on taking the bar
in New york or California?</i>
<i>I don't know yet. I haven't really decided.</i>
<i>you know what? I think everybody's being
a little bit off the mark right now,</i>
<i>talking about law degrees and all that.</i>
<i>This woman can't even cook.
What you gonna feed your children? Huh?</i>
<i>- T.J.
- Fruit Loops?</i>
SpaghettiOs, out of the can?
"Can this," what? What does that mean?
<i>you talking about my mama?</i>
<i>Can your mama
make huevos rancheros?</i>
Huevos, what?
<i>Have you called Father Paez yet?</i>
<i>No, not yet.</i>
<i>Lucia, it's going to take
a personal plea from you</i>
<i>to get him on such short notice.
And if you can't, what are you going to do?</i>
<i>I'm sure we can get somebody else.</i>
So can Lucia.
<i>Grandma, stop.</i>
We were thinking
we might just write our own vows.
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Father Paez baptized you,
and he's done all of our family weddings.</i>
<i>Isn't it enough that
you're being disrespectful to your faith</i>
by not marrying in the church?
<i>Okay, I will call him. I'll call him.</i>
We were supposed to come to town,
<i>and you were going to
come clean to your parents</i>
<i>and have a small ceremony
before heading overseas.</i>
<i>Now all I hear is
tradition this and tradition that,</i>
and you changing everything
we agreed on.
<i>Well, I can see how you might be
a little reluctant towards tradition,</i>
given the very unorthodox way
you grew up.
Unorthodox?
<i>Marcus, you were raised by a single man
who dates girls I went to high school with.</i>
<i>It's a little unorthodox.</i>
<i>No, you're trying to flip this on me,
make up for the fact that</i>
<i>- you can't tell your dad the truth.
- All right. Okay.</i>
<i>you know, you get around your family,
you act like a little 12-year-old.</i>
<i>- you're a grown woman.
- Marcus, I don't really feel like</i>
<i>talking about this right now.</i>
<i>Baby. Babe, Lucia, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Look, everything is just so tense
around this wedding, you know?</i>
<i>yes. I know.</i>
<i>I don't really wanna think
about this wedding anymore.</i>
We just need to have fun.
<i>- Have fun?
- That's not what I meant.</i>
<i>All right, sweetie.
Give me a good one, this one.</i>
Hey, hey.
Baby, hi.
<i>Daddy, I invited Marcus.
He played in high school. He's really good.</i>
<i>What's up, pop-in-law?</i>
<i>Hey, Miguel. Lucia said that
your team needed some help, so I'm here.</i>
- Hi, Brad.
- What?
<i>yeah. No... We don't need any help.</i>
We've never won a game.
<i>I'm gonna warm up with Marcus, Dad.</i>
Marcus, make sure you're ready.
<i>Come on, Dad. you got this.</i>
<i>All right, Luce. you know where to put it.</i>
What the...
<i>That's all right, Dad.</i>
<i>- Come on, Marcus.
All right, Marcus.</i>
<i>- Show the old man what you got.
Come on, Marcus.</i>
<i>Go, baby.</i>
<i>See, we're not all about the flash.</i>
We're about the work ethic.
That's why we dominate the game.
<i>Like A- Rod and Manny,
that kind of work ethic?</i>
<i>Well, those guys are Dominican.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, what are you trying to say?</i>
<i>Come on, B-squared.</i>
<i>BOyD: Give me one.
Knock it out.</i>
<i>yeah, yeah. Go, go, go, go. yes!</i>
<i>Come on, Brad.</i>
<i>I got it! I got it!</i>
<i>Good job, Dad.</i>
Come on in, come on in, come on in, guys,
come on in.
<i>- Okay...
- Okay, look,</i>
<i>we're only down by one.</i>
<i>I just need one of you to get on base,
and I'll get us home.</i>
<i>- Right. That's a good plan.
- All right.</i>
<i>I've never seen anybody strike out
in self- pitch softball before.</i>
<i>Oh, the bat slipped, okay?</i>
<i>Hold it tighter next time. Just a thought.</i>
<i>- Dad, you got this.
- Okay. I got this.</i>
<i>Win on three. Win on three.</i>
<i>One, two, three...
Win.</i>
<i>Watch, brother. you're about to
witness Mexican power, my friend.</i>
<i>- Oh, I don't think so.
- yeah, Mexican power. Say it.</i>
<i>- Hold the bat.
- No, Mexican power.</i>
<i>- Just hold the bat.
- Mexican power.</i>
<i>- Hold the bat. Don't drop the bat.
- Mexican power.</i>
<i>Try not to drop the bat. Don't drop the bat.</i>
Don't drop the bat!
<i>Come on, Miguel.</i>
<i>- All right, Daddy.
He's a choker.</i>
Don't pay attention to them.
<i>Here we go. Nice and easy.</i>
<i>BOyD: you can do it. Hit the ball.
Hit the ball. Good job. Go!</i>
<i>Go, go. you got it.</i>
<i>Run, run, run.</i>
<i>Go, Daddy. Go, go, go!</i>
<i>- Go!
- Come on, Dad!</i>
<i>Come on, man! No!</i>
<i>you're short.</i>
<i>That was a good hustle, Dad.</i>
<i>you got to be kidding me. Miguel.</i>
<i>you... What was that?</i>
<i>It's all right, Dad.</i>
Come on, Marcus, knock it out of the park.
One more time, baby. Come on.
<i>Come on, Daddy. Give him a good one.</i>
<i>Knock it out of the park, Marcus.</i>
Come on, baby. Bring mama home.
<i>you got this.</i>
<i>All right, Marcus.
Show the old man what you got.</i>
<i>Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!</i>
Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus!
What the...
<i>Marcus. Daddy, what are you doing?</i>
<i>- Are you okay?
- BOyD: Are you crazy or something?</i>
<i>- you lost your mind?
- Come on, let's go.</i>
Hey, hey, hey.
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>
<i>What is your problem, Dad?</i>
<i>What is my problem? Brad attacked me.</i>
<i>yeah. After you beaned Marcus
with the ball.</i>
<i>The ball slipped. And the way
he fell to the floor, all dramatic.</i>
<i>- I mean, come on.
- Dad, stop.</i>
- He's not good enough for you.
- Oh, come on. How can you say that?
He went to USC.
<i>He graduated from
Columbia Medical School.</i>
<i>Daddy, what is the problem?</i>
<i>If he's so special,
why did you hide him from me?</i>
<i>I wasn't hiding him.</i>
We speak every Sunday,
and you never brought up his name.
Why?
<i>Come on in the house, mi hija.</i>
<i>I promised Lucia
her parents would love me.</i>
<i>- There you go.
- Guess I lied.</i>
<i>Dude's a little off. you know that, right?
I mean, he's a little touched.</i>
<i>To be honest,
I'm not in love with them either.</i>
<i>I mean, is that wrong?
Should I be worried about that?</i>
<i>Or the fact that none of this is
going like I thought it would?</i>
<i>you say you want to marry her, I'm good.</i>
<i>you say you don't want to marry her,
I'm good, too.</i>
<i>That's not what I'm talking about.
I just really need some advice here.</i>
<i>I'm your dad, but I'm not the person
to ask for marriage advice from.</i>
<i>'Cause you know how I feel about that.</i>
<i>you'll figure it out. I've always let you
do your thing, and you always do it good.</i>
<i>yeah, I know. I just...</i>
<i>Sometimes, I wish
you weren't so unorthodox.</i>
<i>Oh, oh! Okay. I see. Is this 'cause</i>
<i>I didn't make you eat that asparagus,
make you grow up really big and strong?</i>
<i>you still grew up big and strong.</i>
<i>Is that what you wanted?</i>
<i>yeah, maybe.</i>
<i>I can see that you're head over heels
for this girl.</i>
<i>I felt like that about your mom.</i>
<i>I rushed it. I ignored all the signs.</i>
<i>So if anything doesn't feel good, anything,</i>
<i>all I'm asking is that you trust it.</i>
<i>- Okay?
- yeah.</i>
<i>Ready now.
Here's the pitch, high and outside.</i>
<i>Ball three.</i>
<i>you know, this guy doesn't look nearly as
sharp today as he was in his last outing.</i>
<i>In fact, this is as far out of the strike zone</i>
<i>that I've seen him pitch
in a long, long time.</i>
<i>Okay. Runners are at first and second
in the third. No score.</i>
<i>you know, when you were a little girl,
I would rock you to sleep.</i>
<i>I would dream about the day
that you'd get married.</i>
<i>What it would be like,
what he would be like.</i>
<i>This is just not how I dreamt it would be.</i>
<i>yeah.</i>
<i>Well, it's not your dream anymore, Dad.</i>
<i>It's mine.</i>
<i>And when I look at Marcus,
I don't see brown, or black, or white.</i>
<i>Isn't that how you raised me?</i>
<i>Well, good night.</i>
Okay.
<i>Here comes the bride</i>
<i>Here comes the bride
on the top of the cake</i>
<i>- BOyD: Is this organic?
- Oh, yeah. No, no, no.</i>
<i>This is from where?
A different place, or what?</i>
<i>- Three different places?
- Listen, I want... No.</i>
<i>No, no, no. I want you to experience
the cake like you will on the day.</i>
The bride and groom
need to feed each other.
- Oh.
- That's the tradition.
<i>That's really sweet, but we're not the...</i>
Wow, that is such a great idea.
<i>- Honey...
- I bet it even tastes different.</i>
<i>- you only get married once.
That's exactly right.</i>
<i>- Here we go.
- yes, you link arms.</i>
<i>That's the tradition.
The bride needs a little cake</i>
to feed to the groom.
<i>And then, how do you turn it around
to go back like...</i>
<i>you see what I'm saying?
This whole thing is ridiculous.</i>
<i>- you are an ass.
- Why do people who love each other</i>
shove cake into each other's face?
<i>Because they love each other.</i>
Why do we have to have cake?
<i>- No!
No, that's not how we do it.</i>
<i>- you're supposed to take a little piece.
- Well, that's how we do it.</i>
<i>- Now it's on.
- Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.</i>
<i>What are you doing? No, no, no!</i>
<i>- What are you doing? No, no.
- Get out of the way.</i>
Excuse me. Stop! Stop!
Oh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
<i>Okay. This has got...</i>
<i>Got to stop, okay? I mean, to leave them...</i>
<i>I know you're getting married...
No, no, no. Oh, God. Okay.</i>
<i>Not in my hair. Are you serious?</i>
<i>So much more fun planning a wedding
when you're not the one getting married.</i>
<i>yeah. Speak for yourself.
Because this wedding is killing me.</i>
<i>And my pocketbook.</i>
<i>I hear you.</i>
<i>What? you just threw that thing
on the floor.</i>
<i>you know you just threw that on the floor?
you're messing with me, right?</i>
<i>I am. I do half of the things I do
to mess with you.</i>
- Why do you want to mess with me?
- Because...
<i>Why do you like messing with me?</i>
<i>- I think...
- you think...</i>
<i>I can feel it</i>
<i>Even when you're not here</i>
<i>I can't do a thing
Oh, I'm so in love with you</i>
<i>So, darling, help me, please</i>
<i>Have mercy on a fool like me</i>
<i>- Getting nervous?
- No.</i>
<i>This is Brad Boyd coming at you live,
Hot 93.7 KZL y.</i>

'"What are you doing tonight, LA? '"</i>
<i>All right, caller, you're on.</i>

<i>I'm coming with you to see about this DJ.</i>
<i>Hey, Brad. How's it going?
- I'm with him.</i>
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy.

- He's with me.
- Sorry.
Come here.
- Hey.
- Hey!
See this?
<i>yeah. I'm gonna have a drink.</i>
<i>- Bartender.

<i>- A what?
- Mixologist.</i>
<i>Don't mess with this guy's identity,
all right?</i>
<i>- What kind of beer you have on tap?
- We only serve what's on the menu.</i>
<i>Could I have a Hendricks with about
this much tonic and a splash of bitters.</i>
<i>It's not on the menu.</i>
<i>- Let me know, guys.
- Watch this. Watch this.</i>
- Bartender.
- Hey, guy behind bar!
<i>- Sir Mix-a-Lot.
- Mixmaster flash.</i>
<i>- Mixologist.

<i>- Let's have a Pink Nipple.
- Make that two Nipples, please.</i>
<i>Wow! It gives it that irrigated flavor.</i>
<i>Really? He's serious.</i>
<i>Look at that. Ooh!</i>
<i>- Just like a Cosmo, you know?
- A what?</i>
<i>- A Cosmo.
- Open up a tab?</i>
We're just gonna have one drink.
<i>Hey, mixologist.</i>
<i>Please fill my liquid receptacle.</i>
<i>When is the last time
that you were in a club?</i>
<i>- I've been married for 25 years, right?
- Okay.</i>
Twenty-five years!
<i>yeah, baby!</i>
Oh, yeah! Remember that?
- That was nice.
- What about this?
<i>And then the Roger Rabbit.
Bro, remember that movie?</i>
<i>yeah, there it is. There it is. I could do it.</i>
<i>The Matrix. Look, The Matrix.
I'm Neo! I'm Neo!</i>
Shoot me! Hey, Brad.
<i>- yeah?
- I can't get up, bro.</i>
<i>you got it. you got it. yeah.</i>
Whoo!
That's a true story.
<i>- Do you guys know Duran Duran?
- yeah.</i>
<i>The Reflex. I told them, all of them.</i>
They gave me this tie, man.
This is a Duran Duran tie.
<i>yeah, man.</i>
<i>Miguel, we gotta chill
on the drinking, man,</i>
<i>'cause we still gotta go over here,
talk to the DJ.</i>
<i>- yeah, 'cause that's why we're here.
- yeah. Hey, hey, hey!</i>
- DJ Spin-Sane.
- There he is!
<i>- The spinster.
- yeah, I'm Spin-Sane.</i>
<i>But I ain't no DJ, gramps.
I'm a turntable- ist.</i>
<i>you got... Exactly, man.</i>
<i>It's a whole new world out there, bro.</i>
<i>See, he isn't a DJ. He's a turntable- ist.</i>
<i>- And that guy over there, mixologist.
- BOyD: Mixologist!</i>
<i>I am not a Latin. I am a Latinist.</i>
<i>So add an "- ist" at the end.
Fo' shizz, my nist.</i>
<i>- 'Cause what are you?
- I'm a radio-logist.</i>
<i>- you're a doctor.
- Always wanted to be a doctor.</i>
<i>Like father, like son, Doctor.</i>
What the...
<i>Hey, man!
- Cool, cool.</i>
<i>No, that's funny. Come on, that's funny.</i>
<i>- Wow, look at his face.
- BOyD: It was a mistake.</i>
<i>- He's been drinking a little bit.
- He's like a mountain.</i>
<i>Hey, you're a mountain-ist.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>
Hey, he wants to dance.
He wants to dance.
<i>Captain, line two.
Oh, thanks.</i>
<i>you should have had the wedding here.
you can't seem to stay away.</i>
<i>you were supposed
to just go in there and see the DJ.</i>
<i>- Why couldn't you even do that?
- It's not my fault.</i>
<i>I told you he was a little touched.
He went crazy loco on me in there.</i>
<i>- Too many Nipples.
What?</i>
<i>Look, for the next couple of days,
I just need you to be my dad.</i>
<i>After the wedding's done,
you can go back to being Brad Boyd.</i>
<i>- Hey, I'm always your dad, all right?
- yeah, and I've always been your dad.</i>
<i>- Jesus!
Hey, watch your mouth.</i>
<i>I get to act crazy and be drunk
'cause I raised you your whole life.</i>
<i>And then he comes around and tells me
that he's gonna marry my daughter</i>
and take her to Timbuktu.
Oh, yeah, and not bring in a paycheck.
<i>He's gonna be living off
of your lawyer checks</i>
<i>while he sits around
just doing whatever he does.</i>
<i>Are you saying that your daughter
is too good for my son?</i>
<i>No. No, I'm not.</i>
<i>But I am asking you, Marcus, straight up,
man to man,</i>
<i>would you respect a man
who doesn't pull his own weight?</i>
<i>No, sir, I wouldn't.</i>
<i>- I'm gonna tell him tomorrow. I promise.
- Whatever.</i>
<i>Do you want to be
like your new buddy Brad</i>
<i>and hang out at the clubs all night long,
picking up on the young girls?</i>
<i>you know, Sonia, I forgot Valentine's Day
and I'm really sorry.</i>
The other day
my daughters made fun of me.
<i>- What do you mean?
- They didn't know I was listening</i>
<i>and they made fun
of the woman I've become.</i>
<i>- They're our children. That's what they do.
- No, no, no. I used to be a cool chick.</i>
<i>- I was fun. Don't you miss that?
- We're not kids anymore.</i>
<i>I know.
I know we're not kids anymore, Miguel.</i>
<i>But when did I stop being a woman?
I'm a wife, I'm a mother.</i>
<i>But you don't see me as that girl
that you used to pick up in your ride.</i>
<i>And we would just drive
with the top down.</i>
<i>Then we'd park
and listen to music all night,</i>
<i>till the sun came up.</i>
<i>But we can't do that anymore
'cause I gotta go to work.</i>
<i>Why is it when I asked you the other day
how I looked,</i>
you said, "Fine,"
<i>but whatever car you're working on
looks sexy?</i>
<i>I dropped out of law school
to be a volunteer teacher.</i>
<i>We think that's noble. He's not going to.
It's gonna kill him.</i>
Baby, he was drunk
and pouring his heart out.
<i>- What was I supposed to do?
- Stand up for me.</i>
<i>you just stood there and watched
as I drowned to save yourself.</i>
<i>I know about disappointment.
you know how I feel about my mother.</i>
<i>Babe, it wasn't like that.</i>
<i>Look, when you tell me you love me,
I need to be able to trust that.</i>
<i>When you say you'll never leave me,
I need to be able to believe it.</i>
<i>If you can't stand up to your dad
for our relationship, for me,</i>
then what are we doing?
Why are we doing this?
What are you saying?
<i>you don't want to do this?
you don't want to get married?</i>
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>you don't know?</i>
<i>Well, let me make it easy for you.</i>
<i>Lucia, what's wrong?</i>
- The wedding's off.
- What? Wait a minute.
What do you mean our wedding is off?
<i>No, Mom, not our wedding.
My wedding is off.</i>
- The wedding's off?
- The wedding's off.
<i>you want to go toss the ball, angel?</i>
<i>No, Dad, I don't want to toss a ball!</i>
<i>- And I'm not your angel.
- Lucia, calm down.</i>
<i>Would your angel
have dropped out of law school?</i>
<i>you dropped out of law school?</i>
<i>And I've been volunteer teaching
at a charter school</i>
for immigrants for three months.
<i>And I love it.
Imagine that, Daddy, I love what I do.</i>
<i>Oh, and I've been living with Marcus.</i>
<i>And yes, we were having sex.</i>
- Hey.
- Hey!
<i>I was in the neighborhood, so I thought
I'd drop off the invoice from the caterers.</i>
Okay. Oh, great, great.
Thanks.
<i>Can I come in?</i>
<i>I got some... Just a couple of things
I'm gonna take care of.</i>
Brad?
<i>Brad, I think the omelet's burning.</i>
<i>I'll be right there. I'll be right there.</i>
<i>Angie! Angie!</i>
<i>Angela, you're my best friend.
I don't want to mess that up, all right?</i>
There's no woman that means more to me
than you mean to me.
<i>She appeared in the distance</i>
<i>Like a prayer I had uttered once</i>
<i>She appeared in my life</i>
<i>Like a dream</i>
<i>only half-remembered</i>
<i>She entered my heart</i>
<i>Stayed a while</i>
<i>She entered my heart</i>
<i>Stayed a while</i>
<i>Made me to smile</i>
<i>Then gone</i>
<i>Gone from my life</i>
<i>yeah</i>
<i>Her love was like a burning flame of desire</i>
<i>Desire</i>
<i>If I could do it all over again,</i>
<i>I would call you after my first semester</i>
<i>and tell you that,</i>
<i>even though I know how hard you
worked to put me through law school,</i>
<i>it just didn't feel right.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>
<i>I just hope that you can forgive me.</i>
Remember when you were nine,
<i>and you melted that stick of butter
on the brand new VCR</i>
<i>with the Duran/Leonard fight tape
still in it?</i>
<i>you were so scared when I came home.</i>
<i>And I told you, "Even when I'm mad at you,</i>
<i>"I still love you. "</i>
<i>I'll always love you.</i>
<i>I made one mistake. One.</i>
<i>What, did he just forget all the times
that I was there for him?</i>
<i>Through med school,
when his mom would call.</i>
<i>- He doesn't want to marry me.
- He said, "I don't know. "</i>
How many times did we scream
at each other growing up?
<i>Two hours later, we're best friends again.
Only difference is, now we're grownups.</i>
<i>Gotta apologize first.</i>
<i>We never apologize.
That's how we dominate their brain.</i>
<i>Okay, get up.</i>
<i>- Put this on. Come on. Let's go.
- What are you doing?</i>
Being your maid of honor.
<i>Just shut up. Stop it. Go. Get up.</i>
<i>She was beautiful. She was classy,</i>
adventurous.
<i>But she never really loved me.</i>
Five.
<i>- you know how I knew?
- How?</i>
<i>She never laughed at my jokes.</i>
<i>- Pop, your jokes are corny.
- That's not the point.</i>
<i>If your lady loves you,
she laughs at your jokes.</i>
<i>It was a sign. I just totally ignored it.</i>
<i>Lucia laughs at my jokes.</i>
<i>That's 'cause Lucia is your friend.</i>
<i>Gotta pay attention to the signs.</i>
Five.
- Wait, wait.
- What?
<i>What's the plan?</i>
<i>My plan was to get you here,
and you're here.</i>
<i>- Wait. Izzy, wait.
- What?</i>
<i>What if he won't come out?
What if he doesn't want to talk to me?</i>
Then he doesn't deserve you. Come on.
<i>- I don't want to.
- Come on.</i>
<i>you know, Angela laughs at your jokes.</i>
<i>yeah.</i>
Ten.
Don't do that!
<i>Abort!</i>
What's that?
<i>Stop. Lucia, stop.
you're gonna get us mauled out here.</i>
<i>- Dogs love me.
- They're coyotes.</i>
Oh.
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
What are you doing?
<i>Marcus, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>For making you feel anything less than
the most important person in my life.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>And if you still want me, we could just...</i>
<i>We could go to Vegas tonight
and get married</i>
<i>and we could just forget about all of this,</i>
<i>the wedding and the families
and the traditions and...</i>
Just you and me and...
<i>- your family would kill us.
- I don't care anymore.</i>
<i>Look, babe,
I don't want you to ever feel like</i>
<i>you have to sacrifice your family for me.</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>- Always?
- Always.</i>
<i>Told you.</i>
<i>you</i>
<i>show me who I am and what I'm doing</i>
<i>you</i>
<i>better know this love runs deep</i>
<i>She's not here. She left with Isabel.
- I'm looking for you.</i>
<i>- What, Miguel?
- Come here.</i>
<i>- you know what I realized about this car?
- What?</i>
<i>It's grown and sexy.</i>
<i>Just like my wife.</i>
<i>It's like you two were
meant for each other.</i>
<i>My God!</i>
<i>- I love you.
- I love you more.</i>
<i>Go ahead. Have fun.</i>
Hey, baby.
Want to come have fun with me?
<i>yeah.</i>
<i>- Wow, this is a nice car.
- yeah. How do I look?</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>
<i>you guys need to take this ball out
and play on the grass, okay?</i>
- Okay.
- Before you break something.
<i>- That goes by the pool on the right.
- By the pool.</i>
<i>Hey, don't... you're Mr. Popular, right?</i>
<i>Is that my Brian Smith? Hey, you need
to cover that. That's very, very expensive.</i>
<i>yo, bro, you got a plunger?</i>
<i>Fancy toilet.</i>
<i>- I think you have the wrong house.
- Me no English. Sorry.</i>
This is the wrong...
<i>Let me help you. This goes over here
on the table. Thanks. Right here.</i>
<i>- What is this?
- It's a wedding cake.</i>
<i>Wedding cake. Comprende?</i>
<i>Mama, she speaks English.</i>
<i>- Who are these people?
- Excuse you!</i>
<i>you see, this is exquisite cake.</i>
<i>- No.
- I chose it myself.</i>
<i>The chef, he worked three hours
on the marzipan</i>
<i>just to get the right molding and design.</i>
<i>My Lucia is going to have
a traditional Mexican wedding cake.</i>
<i>Honey, you all know
you're across the border.</i>
<i>I'll handle it, Ma.</i>
<i>- Hermoso. It's a beautiful cake.
- The kids are gonna love this cake.</i>
<i>It is beautiful.</i>
<i>- you want cake?
- yes.</i>
<i>- you want cake?
yeah.</i>
There!
<i>Keisha. Keisha!</i>
<i>Keisha! No, baby. Stop!</i>
<i>No, we gotta give it to Jesus.
Come on, baby, give it to Jesus.</i>
What is this?
<i>Oh, my God. It's a dish called birria.
It's for Mexican celebrations.</i>
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
you need to get this thing out of here.</i>
<i>yes, I know.</i>
<i>Hey! No, no! We are not gonna kill a goat
in this man's backyard.</i>
<i>No goat killing in the house.</i>
<i>He'll eat anything.</i>
<i>No, no. Not in my house.
you gotta get him.</i>
<i>He's a goat! What the hell, bro?</i>
What now?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
What's going on? Who did this?
- He did!
- He did!
<i>- Can you take care of your kids, please?
- Wendell, get the boys, please.</i>
<i>- Get them outside.
- Thank you, Brad.</i>
<i>you see that little line right there?
Off-limits.</i>
Don't come in my house.
<i>They're just hyper, Brad. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Nice.</i>
<i>- Family.
- I know.</i>
<i>- you understand?
- I understand.</i>
<i>BOyD: Can you see it?
No.</i>
<i>Look at this mess!</i>
<i>- He tore your bathroom up.
- I can't believe it. Look at this.</i>
<i>- Where's the goat?
- I don't know. Maybe he got out.</i>
What?
<i>- BOyD: What the heck?
- Go!</i>
<i>Hey, Miguel. Down, boy. Down.</i>
<i>Just let him finish, then he'll go to sleep.</i>
<i>I got it!</i>
<i>- Where the...
- Get the goat!</i>
<i>The goat! The goat!</i>
<i>Look at this.
They do some kind of ritual around here.</i>
<i>I saw that goat with something on.</i>
<i>- yeah. I've never seen no goat...
- I've never seen anything like this.</i>
<i>- All Spanish weddings have goats?
- This is ridiculous.</i>
<i>Got to pray. This is terrible.</i>
<i>- Look at this.
- This is embarrassing.</i>
<i>Got to pray, yes.</i>
<i>It's all right, Luce.
We're gonna fix it right now.</i>
<i>- No worries.
- Call me.</i>
<i>Totally got it. We're all helping.
Everybody's helping.</i>
Why is there a goat here?
Who brought a goat?
- Dia did.
- Dia, you brought a goat?
<i>I bring it for the barbeque.</i>
<i>Marcus, you're not supposed to see me.
It's bad luck.</i>
This is a disaster.
<i>All right, everybody. Let's get this
cleaned up. We got a wedding.</i>
- Okay, enough.

Okay.
<i>- I made you these.

<i>I'm sorry for every wrong word
I ever said about your mother.</i>
<i>I'm sorry for every wrong thing
I ever said about marriage.</i>
'Cause the truth is,
<i>if Cheryl were here right now,
I would thank her.</i>
<i>Tell her that I don't have any regrets
'cause it gave me you.</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you, Son.</i>
<i>All right, GQ.</i>
<i>- Hi, Angie.

Okay.
<i>Please, all be seated.</i>
Excuse me.

<i>May I have the honor
of your daughter's hand in marriage?</i>
Oh.
<i>Baby, you don't have to kneel.

<i>Now, may we have the veil,
which brings them together into one.</i>
<i>May we have the lasso?</i>

<i>Do you remember
the 21st night of September?</i>
<i>Love was changing the minds of pretenders</i>
<i>While chasing the clouds away</i>
<i>Our hearts were ringing</i>
<i>In the key that our souls were singing</i>
<i>As we danced in the night</i>
<i>Remember how the stars
stole the night away</i>
<i>I love you.</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Dancing in September</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Never was a cloudy day</i>
<i>My thoughts are with you</i>
<i>Holding hands with your heart to see you</i>
<i>Only blue talk and love</i>
<i>Remember how we knew
love was here to stay</i>
<i>Now December</i>
<i>found the love
that we shared in September</i>
<i>Only blue talk and love</i>
<i>Remember the true love we share today</i>
<i>yeah</i>
<i>Ah, ba de ya
Say, do you remember?</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Dancing in September</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Golden dreams were shiny days</i>
<i>The bells were ringing</i>
<i>Oh, our souls were singing</i>
<i>Do you remember?
Never a cloudy day</i>
<i>And there's a ba de ya
Say, do you remember?</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Dancing in September</i>
<i>Ba de ya
Golden dreams were shiny days</i>
<i>Soft lips glistening
Got me listening to your every word</i>
<i>Though I don't speak a word of Spanish</i>
<i>I can see the language barrier
beginning to blur</i>
<i>Got to have it
Though you're not an item to be won</i>
<i>But a dream too lavish to be slept on</i>
<i>So I uncock my weapon</i>
<i>And step unharmed
to your feminine charms</i>
<i>Take a chance and ask you
to dance with me</i>
<i>Though some say I got two left feet
I still glide to the beat</i>
<i>Sliding with thee in motion</i>
<i>Overdosing from the opulent potion</i>
<i>Emotion crashing like the ocean</i>
<i>Tide rising, splashing</i>
<i>Our silhouettes enclosing in the passion
Heart dashing</i>
<i>Souls lock, sweat glistening
yeah</i>
<i>Let your eyes do the talking
I'm listening</i>
<i>On this hot Spanish night</i>
<i>your eyes are like candlelight</i>
<i>I wonder, would it be all right with you</i>
<i>if we could fly away to the moon</i>
<i>Hot like the pimientos de Padron pepper</i>
<i>Sweet like churros but way better</i>
<i>Let the world go
Let's toast to full-bodied red wine</i>
<i>Sip it slow and let it breathe
as the perfume unwinds</i>
<i>Grapes plucked from a vintage vine</i>
<i>Got me sinking deep into your intense eyes</i>
<i>Let the incense rising cause an effect
Blood rushing</i>
<i>All right, let me pause for a sec</i>
<i>I'm combusted
and I don't want to fall in my step</i>
<i>Entrusting you
Got all my respect</i>
<i>Call me collect
Myphone's on roam</i>
<i>I love your breath in my ear
and your vocal tone</i>
<i>Hot Spanish night</i>
<i>your eyes are like candlelight</i>
<i>I wonder, would it be all right with you</i>
<i>if we could fly away to the moon</i>
<i>Hot Spanish night</i>
<i>your eyes are like candlelight</i>
<i>I wonder, would it be all right with you</i>
<i>if we could fly away to the moon</i>
