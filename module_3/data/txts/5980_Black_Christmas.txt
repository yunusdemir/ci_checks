Merry Christmas
from your friends and family
at the Clark Sanitarium.
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays.
Leave me alone!
Merry Christmas.
Happy holidays.
Happy birthday.
Behold. Wise men from the east
came to Jerusalem,
saying, "Where..."
How'd you get in here?
The door was open.
I was looking for the children's
ward, and I got lost.
This ain't no place
for Santa Claus.
Not at Christmas.
Lenz?
Billy Lenz?
That's the guy that killed
his family at Christmas,
back when I was a kid.
You know, a lot of
people say he's dead.
Poke your head inside.
Check if he's been naughty
or nice.
No, that's... it's okay.
I thought so.
You guys keep him locked
up with just a padlock?
That lock's just to make him
feel at home.
Right, 'cause his mom kept him
locked in the basement
his whole life.
The attic.
See, that's the key
to Billy Lenz.
<i>He just wants to feel at home,</i>
especially on Christmas.
He's tried to escape
every year...
...just to be home on Christmas.
It tastes like chicken.
Because it's chicken.
It's the closest
we could get to how
Mom used to taste.
Kyle...
- Mm.
- It's late.
I have to go inside.
Mm-mm.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-mm.
They might be waiting for me.
See? That's them calling.
You can be with them any time.
Yeah, but it's not
any time, though.
It's Christmas.
I know, but it's our first.
We should be together.
We will.
On Christmas Day.
I can't wait until you
see what I got you.
And then, we'll be
together all week.
Well, besides when
I have to work.
Look, I'm excited,
baby, but I got to be
with my sorority sisters, too.
I mean, I've never
really had a big family.
I'm your family now.
I love you.
I'll see you later.
Hello.
# I love
those J-I-N-G-L-E bells #
# Bong! #
# Jingle bells #
# Jingle bells,
jingle all the way #
# Oh, what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh #
# Jingle bells,
jingle bells... #
Billy.
Billy.
Billy...
Girls, I can't find
Billy's present
under the tree here.
Come on, girls, we can't
start the Secret Santa
without Billy's present.
Hello? Who drew
Billy's name?
Um, Ms. Mac,
it's a Secret Santa.
Can't we just get on with
this thing, so I can party
for a few days
before having to deal
with the family on Christmas.
Have you looked outside?
It's raining hail the size
of Yao's ball sack.
It'll stop.
The party gods won't allow me
to be here by myself
- over Christmas break.
- Oh, I'll be here, Dana.
Yeah, they're making me work
next week.
That sucks-- everyone
should be home for Christmas.
All right, all right,
who's not here?
Um, like everybody.
Chelsea?
She went home this morning.
- Greer?
- No, that was her on the phone.
She and Erin and Taylor
are off on that cozy
little ski trip
with the boys
from G.A.D. next door.
Didn't I see Clair earlier?
Isn't she upstairs
writing a card to her sister?
No, I think her sister
picked her up earlier.
Remember, this is the occasion
for Clair and her sister
and her mom
to... bury the hatchet
and rediscover
each other.
Oh.
I'd like to bury the hatchet
with my sister...
...right in her head.
In your dreams, Billy.
In your dreams.
Lauren, we're opening up
presents.
Clair, we're opening up
presents.
Okay, I realize that
you're an only child,
so let me explain.
Christmas is just Darwin.
The weak get eaten.
We're opening up
gifts right now!
If you're not downstairs
in five minutes, your presents
are mine!
Now show me.
Okay.
We're opening up
presents in five minutes!
If you're not downstairs,
then I'm going
to take your presents.
Just fuck Christmas.
Fuck it.
Whatever.
Hey, Megan, are you okay?
Yes!
No.
Megan...
Honestly, Santa loves...
All right.
Who's fucking with me?
Clair?
What are you doing?
# Fa la la la la
la la la la #
# 'Tis the season to be jolly #
Hey, Santa, if I sit
on your lap,
will you give me
what I want for Christmas?
I don't know,
you've been good all year.
You sure you want to blow it
on the last day, huh?
I'll be good.
I bet you will.
Happy holidays.
Yeah.
Ever seen the backseat
of a sleigh?
# Fa la la la la la
la la la #
You know, Santa
checks his list twice.
I know you're
very, very naughty.
Hello?
Santa, my shift's over.
You know, Santa's not one
to keep a girl waiting.
##
Mrs. Mac, why don't you
open the present we got you.
Because we have to open
Billy's present first.
It's a 15-year Delta
Alpha Kappa tradition.
Okay, I...
I drew that name.
But can I say,
I'm sorry, I'm just,
I'm really not okay
with any of this.
I mean, buying a
Christmas present
for a serial killer?
No, you see,
serial killers murder
repeatedly for sexual thrill.
Billy Lenz
was a spree killer.
Dude just fucking lost it.
Thank you.
Oh, whatever, Melissa, okay?
I'm just offended
by a pagan sacrifice
to ward off evil spirits
on Christmas.
Heather, we're just having
a little bit of fun.
Christmas is more about warding
off evil spirits than Halloween.
What Christmas shit
in this room resembles
anything Christian, huh?
It's all neo-pagan magic.
Christmas tree--
a magical rite ensuring
the return of the crops.
The mistletoe is nothing
but a conception charm.
Fifth century Christians
jacked a Roman winter festival--
12 days in December
where the nights were long
and the Earth was roamed
by the demons of chaos.
And fucking Santa Claus?
This fat voyeur
that watches you all year long
to make sure you live up to
his standards of decency before
breaking into your house?
And that is different
from what Billy did... how?
Billy didn't break in.
Billy lived here.
<i>Billy Edward Lenz was born</i>
<i>with a rare liver disease
that gave him yellow skin.</i>
Merry Christmas, Billy.
<i>His parents hated each other.</i>
<i>The mother hated Billy.</i>
<i>He was not the child
she always wanted.</i>
<i>When she looked at her son,
all she saw</i>
<i>was her husband.</i>
Why you bothering
putting with those cookies?
Santa ain't coming to see you.
Russians shot his sleigh down.
Santa Claus... is dead.
Don't listen to her.
Listen, if you go
upstairs to your room,
you'll find something
for yourself.
Now, go.
Look, I don't give
a shit if you're mean to me,
but to your own kid
on Christmas?
This is my present to myself.
I don't have to listen
to you no more.
You didn't listen to me before.
Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?
He's my family now.
Get out of here!
She's mine now.
This guy?
This guy, this piece of shit,
is your boyfriend?
Gonna be my husband.
Hey, what the fuck is that?
I was in Vietnam.
Do you think I'm afraid of
a dude holding a fucking hammer?
No!
Alpha Kappa.
Hello?
Hello-hello.
Very funny, Kyle.
I think someone's in trouble.
You want a Christmas cookie?
You're my cookie,
and I could gobble you up!
Billy, what have you done?!
What have you done?
Where's Agnes?!
She's my family now.
Hey, shouldn't
you get going?
Don't you have lots
of toys to deliver
- to good little boys and girls?
- Shh.
Get out of my house.
I'm gonna kill you.
- Call the police.
- Please.
Police ain't gonna do shit
about one wack-job phone call.
Just dial "star 69."
That just calls him back--
unless there's something
you need him to clarify.
Caller I.D.
says Clair's cell.
You really shouldn't
provoke somebody like that.
What would you know
about dealing with anyone
other than your NASCAR daddy?
I'm going home.
Yeah, yeah, run to Daddy!
At least my family
wants me to come home.
You guys,
come on.
It's, like, Christmastime.
Yeah.
Come on, Heather.
What about your present?
Give it to Billy.
Merry Christmas, Heather.
Merry Christmas, everyone.
You're all like my family now.
Oh.
Thanks, Eve.
That's... that's so sweet.
I know you like
the Bible and stuff.
Well, that's the spirit!
Well, come on, everybody.
Let's get
this thing rolling.
What have we got here now?
Oh! Melissa.
There you are.
And, uh...
Let's see-- Dana, very nice.
I wonder what this could be.
And let's see...
Aw, "Mrs. Mac."
You shouldn't have.
I'll open it later.
Not again.
Every goddamn time.
My little Agnes.
She's my family now.
All right,
let's get this party going.
Um, let's see.
This one's for Megan.
Kelli, is Megan coming down?
All right, we'll save
that one for later.
Uh... Oh.
Here's one for Mrs. Mac.
Ooh, it's a big one.
All right, I'll wait.
And here is another
one for Melissa.
It's a little one.
Well, you know what they say.
Big things come in small pa...
Well, something like that;
I don't know.
It's all right,
let's see what else.
Then we'll open the stockings.
Oh, Eve, wait, wait.
Let me find your gift.
Eve...
"To Eve from Santa."
Eve?
Does Eve have someplace to be?
The Island of Misfit Toys.
Her mother was a legacy.
And?
Her mother's dead.
She has no boyfriend,
no family.
I mean, really,
where does she have to go?
Who hasn't gotten
a gift yet? Uh...
Lauren?
Just give her a shot of tequila,
wish her happy holidays,
and she's good to go.
Happy holidays.
All right, look, I know
this is the whole
Secret Santa thing,
but I know, um,
Clair drew your name.
Oh, yeah?
She get me anything good?
Oh, yeah.
It's a music box.
It plays "Dance of
the Sugar Plum Fairies."
Oh, fuck, no.
I'm starting to see
the sugar plum fairies.
I don't need to hear
the little fuckers, too.
Language. Language.
Wireless services report
several microwave
relay stations are off-line.
Now, a relay station sends calls
out of the area, so that is why
your cell may work on local
calls, but not on long distance.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!
Does it come with a man
to wear it for?
Whoo!
Here is our real present.
I got it.
Why is Megan calling here?
Hey, where are you?
She's my family now.
Everyone
should be home for Christmas.
I'll be home for Christmas.
I'm going to bury the hatchet,
in your head.
That was not Megan.
You have reached the main menu
of Clement University
campus security.
During the Christmas break...
Is Megan in her room?
I don't know.
I was just packing. What...
What's going on?
Oh, my God.
Kyle.
What are you doing in there?
I wanted to spend
the night with you.
It's okay.
And I knew that mama-san
and your sisters here would kick
me out, so I-I tried to sneak
into your room, but the window
wasn't open, so I, uh,
I saw that,
I saw that Megan's was,
so I climbed up here
to see you.
Is Megan in her room?
I don't know.
You climbed up into her room,
and you don't know
if she's in it?
It's dark.
Does he think
we're fucking stupid?
You were in Megan's room.
The call came from Megan's cell.
What call?
Can I just say,
I'm sorry,
but that-that fucking voice,
that was not Megan or Kyle.
That was the fucking
devil, okay?
And they were not talking to us.
They were talking to Billy.
Billy Lenz, the guy
that used to live in this house?
Well, you're definitely
getting punked.
Yeah, Billy Lenz
is our fucking life.
You know, you spoiled bitches,
you come here for a couple
of years and you leave.
I live here.
I stay here.
I used to play on this street
before they turned them
into frat houses.
This was the house that scared
the shit out of us,
my whole life.
What happened?
You mean after
he washed down his...
Christmas cookies
with a glass of milk?
##
Merry Christmas, Agnes.
Is that Santa's reindeer?
There's nothing up there.
Do you want a Christmas cookie?
You're my cookie,
and I could gobble you up.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas...
Hey. Merry Christmas.
She's my family now.
Agnes?
Billy!
What have you done?!
Where's Agnes?!
Billy, where's Agnes?
What your mother
and I must know is...
Billy!
Where's Agnes?!
What have you done?
What have you done?
Little girl in the corner,
she's hurt.
Go check her out.
<i>Billy was declared insane.</i>
<i>They sent him away
to Clark Sanitarium.</i>
Paramedics saved his sister,
Agnes.
She lost her right eye.
All scarred up, mother murdered,
an inbred.
Her father, Billy,
who was her brother, Billy--
a fucking psycho.
They sent her to an orphanage.
Like, what chance did she have
that a foster family
would ever take her?
No one's seen her since.
Did they ever
find out from him
why he killed his family?
Well... it seemed to him
that's how they showed
their love.
Clair?
Megan?
Can we help you?
She was supposed to call.
I'm Clair's sister.
Where is she?
I'm kind of worried about Megan.
Who knows
what her deal is, okay?
- Can we go to my apartment?
- No. She was weird before.
I mean, she was a bitch to me,
and that's never happened.
And we've been getting
these weird phone calls,
one from her cell,
and her car's still outside,
and she's just, what,
gone in the middle
of this weather?
- Hey.
- Ow.
What, exactly,
are you looking for?
Like, a note or something
that says she's okay.
All her stuff is here,
and her car is outside.
Okay. Call her cell.
You're a legacy?
What year?
'93, '94, I don't know.
I started late, I quit early.
1993's the year
I became housemother.
I don't remember you.
I mean, this was supposed to be
such a big fucking weekend.
Excuse my language,
but I drove
all the way out here
in this shitty, shitty weather.
I blew off a weekend
in Vail with a cardiologist...
I love that coat.
Voice mail.
Meg, hi, it's Kel.
Um, look, I was just wondering
if you were okay, and, you know,
wanted to know what happened
to you and stuff, so...
can you just call me back,
please, on my cell?
Okay, bye.
Clair's name is "Crosby."
This says "Colvin."
The divorce will
be final in March.
What else do you need?
Look, I can't tell you
any secrets
about my sister, because
I don't really know her.
I-I-I can't tell you anything
about this place,
because I really fuckin'
hated it here.
Um...
I see Billy
still gets a Christmas present.
Oh, this is new.
It's not, uh...
for Billy,
it's for Alpha Kappa from Billy.
That wasn't here before.
Well, let's open it.
##
What if there's something
on her computer, like, uh,
an e-mail or something
that says where she is?
Hey, you know what?
I don't...
I don't feel comfortable.
uh, whatever, like,
invading someone's privacy
like this.
Try calling the police again.
Who put this under the tree?
She put it there.
She found it.
Are you actually giving me shit
when none of you can tell me
where my sister is, huh?
Where's her room?
Well, you know what that is?
The attic window's open.
What, you think she's up there?
You know her better than I do.
I'm her half-sister,
12 years older.
Clair was in, um...
I don't know, second grade
when I moved in here, this room.
It's weird how, at this age,
12 years seems like nothing.
In fact, in a weird way,
she seems older.
She was the one who wanted
to bridge that time,
finally get to know each other
while we could.
Can, you know, while we can.
Hey.
Same paper as the present
Eve gave me.
That paper's dated
December 26, 1991.
Eve lives in Billy's room.
Maybe she's, like,
obsessed with him.
I'm gonna go up to her room
and see if there's
any of that old newspaper
or anything up there.
Look, I'm tellin' you, it's
the window, Kelli, okay?
Can we just get up to the attic,
and I will close it.
Maybe she changed her mind
and just...
...left.
Look, this was before
you came here.
Okay? I did not put this
on the 'Net.
A guy at my work,
he got pissed off at me,
and he stole my tapes.
Tapes, Kyle?
How many are there,
you fucking liar?!
I can't even
believe that this person is you.
How could you do such a thing?
I saw you so different.
Get out!
Get the fuck out!
Am I gonna show up on there?
Isn't sex enough, Kyle?
You need little visual trophies
to get your thrill?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Go, Kyle, now!
I got her, Ms. Mac.
It's okay, baby.
I got you.
Kelli, I really like you.
A lot.
I don't blame you
for hating me.
But I wasn't dealing.
I wasn't knocking over
7-Elevens.
I didn't hurt anybody.
Yeah, Merry Christmas, asshole.
Fuck all you bitches.
Get out of here now!
Get out of here.
Go. Go!
Kelli...
Um, th-this is Clair's sister.
How fucked up is it that
the only other house on this
street has power?
This one doesn't.
You okay?
- Mel?
- Yeah?
You're a better sister to me
than my own sister.
Yeah, Dick Cheney's
a better sister to you
than your sister.
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know. Ew.
I love you, too, but, honey,
you're really, really smelly.
You need to take a shower.
Can you handle it?
Mm-hmm.
Okay. Come on.
Oh, shit.
The main breaker's
underneath the house.
What? I'm not the totally
helpless daddy's girl
these bitches
make me out to be.
Okay, then go outside
and turn the power on.
Are you high?
I'm not goin' outside.
It's freezing.
It'll take two seconds.
You know where the power is.
I'll keep looking for Clair.
Oh, fine.
Ow.
I'm gonna go put a trash can
by your bed, okay?
Fuck.
You good, drunky?
Okay. No more drinking.
Okay, trash can's
right here, okay?
Merry fuckin' Christmas.
Of course.
It's okay.
Up in Eve's closet,
I found this, and these.
Clair?
Fuck you, Santa Claus.
Eve, you crazy bitch.
I can see your breath.
It must be Kyle.
What do I do?
Answer it.
It says Dana's cell.
Help!
Help me. Help me.
She's my family now.
Dana?
Dana, where are you?!
She went around back
to the fuse box.
Eve's car.
She never left.
Heather, we have
to find Dana first!
Shit.
Dana!
The fuse box
is under the house!
Dana!
Kelli!
Oh, my God.
Oh, and I can't open it!
Come on!
What's she doing,
sleeping in her car?
It's, like, zero degrees out.
Holy fuck!
He's out here.
What? What?
Damn it!
Shit. Shit.
Come on.
Fuck!
What's going on?
911 is experiencing
heavy caller traffic
because of the storm.
Hello?
Hello. Yes, yes.
A girl is... is dead.
Outside.
Yes!
Yes, I know her.
Her name is Eve Agnew.
And we're positive
that she's been murdered.
He's home.
No.
No, no, no, no, no, Ms. Mac.
Billy is dead.
And three other girls are...
Are missing. Missing.
Are missing.
566 Oakdale.
We're the second house on the...
Right.
Alpha Kappa sorority.
Kelli Presley.
Wait, how long until...
What?!
No, no!
We think he's still outside!
Would you wait
around that long
after what I just told you?
Get your purse!
Please, isn't there
anything that you...
Goddamn it!
The storm.
Pile-ups over 91.
Reservists can't make it out
because the streets
are all ice.
Trees have fallen, and they said
they can maybe,
maybe be here in two hours.
Well, we're all gonna be
out of here in two minutes.
Get your things.
- And what about Dana?
- We'll just go over
to the ADG house and get help.
No, they-they've all gone home
or-or skiing.
Okay, okay,
whose family lives the closest,
just-just call them.
Lauren, her mom lives in Boston.
Even if we could
reach them on their cellphone,
it would take four or five hours
before they got here.
Oh, shit, Lauren...
- Let's go.
- No.
We stay together.
We lock up the house--
we got the fireplace poker,
a ski pole or some shit,
and for the next two hours
not let each other
out of our sights.
No. We are driving
to the police station.
- In this weather?
- Even if they can't
do anything, at least
we will all be safe there.
Yeah, and we're not all here!
If we were, then I would go.
That's right.
Unless I see otherwise, I'm
believing that Clair is alive.
<i>And when she comes back, it is
not gonna be to an empty house.</i>
We are safer
sticking together.
All right, then get your coats.
Mel, come on, we're leaving!
Let's go!
I'm not leaving Lauren,
you bitch!
We're sisters...
so act like it.
We'll get the police here
as soon as we can.
Let's go.
Whoa!
We can't see the car.
Maybe from Lauren's room?
Open up, please, Mrs. Mac.
Oh, come on, you piece of shit.
Come on.
They got the car started.
Go, go, go.
All right.
What are you doing?
Here you go.
What is that thing?
Are you kidding?
Privileged bitch.
Frigid Southern princess.
# Good tidings for Christmas,
and a... #
Why aren't they leaving?
Should we go check on them?
Let's go.
Stay with your friend.
Kelli?
Kelli!
Kelli?
Come on!
Fucking window!
It's blocked.
Come on. Come on.
Oh, God.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Go!
- Lauren, where's Mel?
- Shut up.
- Where is Melissa?
- He'll hear you.
Oh, my God... Kyle!
Stop! It's me!
No!
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
There are two bodies
in the driveway.
- Maybe you did it!
- No!
Maybe you did that!
It wasn't... him.
How do you know?
Where's Agnes?
What have you done... Billy?
She's my family now.
He's in the attic...
and I hear
someone else.
Hey, hey, no fucking way.
Let's go.
Clair might be alive--
she might be up there.
No, Eve's not,
Heather's not, Ms. Mac...
I heard more than one voice
on those phone calls.
And I have searched
the whole house.
And I've seen under it.
Where else could he be?
Until I see that she's dead,
she is alive.
This is Billy fucking Lenz
we're talking about here, okay?
He's probably listening to us
right now.
Yeah, and if I had a sister, I
would expect her to go up there.
How would you know?
You don't have a sister.
She does.
Now, let's go.
Wait.
If we go up there,
the second we see they're dead,
we run the fuck
out of this house.
I open the door,
and you hit the light.
Okay?
Okay.
One, two...
Kyle! Kyle!
No... no... no!
No...!
God, no!
Clair!
No!
No! No!
Oh, no! No!
He's my family now.
No! No...!
No! Leigh!
No! No!
Everyone should be
home for Christmas.
Holy...
You're my family now.
No!
Come on!
No!
No!
No! No!
Fuck!
They're not your family.
Agnes.
I'm not your family.
And your brother's not here.
No, my daddy's here.
No!
Leigh!
Leigh!
Leigh!
Help me. Help!
Help me! Please!
I'm in the wall, please!
Leigh!
I'm in the wall!
Help! Help! Help!
Kelli?!
Help! Help!
I'm below you!
Below you!
Help! Help! I'm down here!
Help me!
Help me!
Help! Help! Help me, please!
Kelli!

Dr. Forest, please dial 118...
All right,
good to go.
Still more questions
than answers tonight
at Clement University Hospital,
on what should have been a
typically quiet Christmas Eve.
Earlier, escaped notorious
murderer Billy Lenz,
along with his sister Agnes--
unaccounted for since her recent
release from Woodville--
together went on
a murderous rampage...
No, I'm the only one here.
What about the M.E.?
M.E. barely made it in.
Are you gonna be home soon?
No, I won't be home
till after noon.
Well, 'cause he wants us to
identify all the bodies,
and we've only done two.
Remember when we talked
about this last night?
Uh-huh.
- Don't you?
- Yes.
You know what day it is?
Of course I know what day it is;
the kids'll have to wait.
It's Christmas, jerk.
Fuck!
Bitch.
Think I want to be doing
this on Christmas?
I'm doing my frickin' job.
Mmm.
Ooh, yes, sir.
What the fuck?
Holy shit.
No, no!
How long could they have
been in the house for?
Months? Years?
We're not gonna know that now.
We're never gonna know.
I'm not gonna be able to open
this in front of...
my sister, so...
Baby...
Doctor wants some more
X-rays, and the technician's
about to go home and
won't be in tomorrow.
Kelli?
Kelli?
I thought they took you
to get your X-rays.
You okay?
No!
Forever!
Wait, wait, wait.
Where's Leigh?
I don't know. Restroom, maybe?
They were supposed to
have someone fix this.
Leigh?
