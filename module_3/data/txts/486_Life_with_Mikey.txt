Thank you, uh, george.
That was very good.
What's the difference?
In a hundred years
we'll both be dead.
I'm not sure
I can wait that long.
Let's go, mother. One second.
How did george do, Mr. Chapman?
Do you think you might...
Whoa! Not yet, honey, not yet.
Do you think you might
want to represent him?
Well, we really don't get
much call for children.
Doing strindberg these days.
Maybe george could work up
something a little lighter.
For us next time.
When's little mikey get
here? Good question.
Excuse me.
When's he gonna get here?
Geena. Geena. Geena!
Hi, mr. Chapman.
What is this? It's a walkman.
I know it's a walkman.
Do you know why they
call it a walkman?
Because you're supposed
to wear it when you walk.
Not when you're
sitting at a desk, working.
How can you hear
if somebody calls?
Did somebody call?
Was it for me?
Yeah, harvard medical.
Your brain is ready.
Just get my brother
on the phone, please.
Whoa! Chapman steals the puck,
he splits the "d."
He makes his move.
It's a strong move!
He is the king of west 83rd.
How can he be so good?
How about you're old enough to
be my father! Ohh!
He ignores the feeble taunts
of the pathetic defenders.
Yes! And he... Shoots!
Uh-oh.
C'mere!
You heard him. Get over
there! Huh-huh!
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Calm down, you just
calm down a second.
It's not easy bein' father
to all these kids.
You see that car?
That's my boss's car, and he
ain't gonna be too happy.
If he sees it.
And if he ain't happy,
I ain't happy.
All right, listen.
I appreciate your situation.
I feel compelled to tell you,
however, that I am.
Something of a celebrity.
What kind of celebrity are you?
Asshole of the month?
No, that's all political.
Um, actually, did you ever
see a television show called.
Life with mikey?
You know, he's wacky, he's wild,

Oh, surprise, surprise.
Good morning, geena.

Probably just having some
Artistic differences.
With the director.
Hey, ed, ed, ed, why don't
You relax, all right?
He's a 12-year-old kid.
I know that. You think I
Like jumping every time.

Listen to me.
This is important.

Of barry's mouth.
I'll see you all later.
Hey, mom, get a life.
All right, I'm ready
For your apology.
Wa... Wait a minute.
Wh... What is he talkin' about?
Michael, um, barry
Feels that you're.
Not quite supportive enough.
That you're occasionally
Rude and dismissive...
And you don't take
His career seriously.
You've brought me down here
To apologize to him?
What, are you out of your
Mind? For what?
For discovering him with
His entire head stuffed.
In a box of cocoa puffs?
I made this kid
The cereal king.
Yeah, well, I'm sick of doing
Cereal commercials.
I wanna do new stuff.
I wanna grow artistically.
I wanna work with
Michelle pfeiffer.
How come I wasn't put
Up for her last movie?
Totally our fault, barry.
Barry, they need you in makeup.
We had no idea...
You were interested
In the part.
You know, you're shameless.
Why don't you just get on
Your knees and sacrifice.
A goat to this kid?
Let's hope it doesn't
Come to that.
Barry, if you had only
Mentioned this sooner.
All right, you two clowns,
We'll talk later.
I gotta get into character.
What character?
All you gotta do is swallow.
All right.
You're gonna be laughing
Yourself right out of a client,
Mr. Funny man,
Because brian spiro
From united talent...
Has been takin' me out
To a lotta lunches recently.
Great! He'll be outta business
Soon, the way you eat.
He's kidding, barry!
Michael likes to kid around.
Tell him you were
Kidding, michael.
All right, I...
I was kidding, barry.
I was kidding.
Come on. You know I love you.
Very much.
Mmm!
When I put barry
In that headlock,
I got vitalis
All over my shirt.
Listen, michael, I've got
To talk to you about something.
Yes, ed?
I'm thinking of,
Eh, getting out.

One day, I'm gonna have to
Send the girls to college,
Marilyn wants to go to europe.
We've got the mortgage
On the house, I'm up.
To my ears in credit...
Ed, you're not gonna leave
Me. Ya can't leave me.
This is the only thing
I know how to do.
You gotta make a
Decision, michael.
You wanna do this
Job or you don't.
Because, I gotta tell ya,
Uncle larry asked me.
To come work with him.
Uncle larry? Uncle larry?
Ed, uncle larry sells
Bathroom accessories.
Is that what you wanna
Do with your life?
No, michael, I don't wanna
Work with uncle larry,
But I can't run this
Agency by myself.
Either you start
Becoming a real partner...
Or it's over.
You're right. You're right.
You're right, I'm sorry.

We'll forget the

I don't have your wallet.
You come near me, and
I'll scream for a cop!
What a coincidence.
That's what I was gonna do.
Look, I'm gonna walk

Just give me the wallet.
That's a magnifying glass.

Soon. And now that mom's gone,
It's just me and dad
And little jimmy.
How sad. And...
Don't cry, honey.
You see, little jimmy wants
A batman doll for christmas.
Because he loves batman.
Except he didn't like the second
Movie as much as the first,
But he still wants one.
But my dad can't afford
To buy any presents...
Because he's been out of work
Ever since the accident.
What accident?
A bus hit him on
Madison avenue.
Oh.
He's was riding his bicycle
Because he's been a messenger.
Ever since the strike.
What strike?
The air traffic
Controller's strike.
He's been so depressed.
Sometimes he just sits home,
Staring out the window.
Landing imaginary planes.
So I wanted to try and
Buy jimmy his batman,
But I didn't have any money
Because I'm a child.
So I tried to steal it,
Which is wrong.
And bad and terrible.
But enough about me.
Carol, this isn't my wallet.
That's mine.
That's my wallet.
He's right, his picture's
On the driver's license.
So she tried to steal
Your wallet too, right?
Steal it? This is my daughter.
Your daughter? Give me a break.
How could she be your
Daughter? Yeah!
What do you mean,
How could she be my daughter?
You ever heard of adoption?
Well, I got news for you,
Mister. Your daughter just.
Tried to pickpocket my husband.
You take that back. My little
Girl would never take anything.
That doesn't belong to her.
Isn't that right, honey?
I'm sorry. I'm bad. I know
It. Daddy, I need help.
I know. We're tryin' to get ya
Help. Now, I'm sure if you...
Apologize to this nice man
And give him back his wallet,
He won't call the police.
Can't I just apologize?
Give him the wallet, Okay?

Show's over.

I'm a vegetarian.
Ah, that's fascinating.
How come?
Look, I'm not here to
Talk about food.
I wanna know how much you're
Talkin' about for this tv thing.
Whoa, wait a minute,
Wait a minute.
I got a couple questions for you
Before we get into.
The financial end of things.
Yeah, well, I got some
Questions for you.
How come you get to go first?
'Cause if you don't answer
My questions, I don't know if
I can take you to the audition.
And if you don't answer
My questions, I don't know.
If I can go to an audition.
And if you keep blowin'
That smoke in my face,
We're through talkin' now.
Sorry. What's your
Name, anyway?
Angie vega. And this is
The non-smoking section.
You wanna put that out
Before I get sick?
Mmph.
How much money
We talkin' about?
Well, for four national spots,
Depending on how often.
It airs, it could be...
I don't know...
Somewhere In the neighborhood.
Of $250,000.
$250,000? You serious?
How old are you? Ten.
Did you say $250,000? Could be.
How come you're not in school?
Uh, today's a school day?
Do your parents
Know you're here?
No, my parents are dead.
What commercial's
Gonna want me?
It's for sunburst cookies.
Who do you live with?
I live with my sister,
Janis, and her boyfriend.
What do they think about
You not bein' in school?
They don't think much
Of anything. She's a scorpio.
And he's an idiot.
What do you get outta this?
Standard agency commission.
What's that?
Ten percent on
Whatever you make.
What should I pay you 10% for?
Well, you need my expertise
And coaching.
You need my guidance
On what to wear.
You need me to tell you
Where the audition is.
First of all, I don't need you
To tell me what to wear.
And I'll give you five percent.
Thanks very much,
But it's ten percent.
Six percent. Ten percent.
End of conversation.
Seven percent. Ten percent.
It's the law, all right?
It's in every standard
Agency agreement.
This is not negotiable.
Seven and a half.
Ten percent, and that's it!
Here you go.
Separate checks.

Something with her hair?
Excuse us a moment, miss vega.
Hey, ed... All right,

She's dyin' to act,
And my gut instincts tell me.
She's got what it takes.

You don't even have
An appointment!
Could you just sit down and
Fill this out, all right?
Everything's Under control. Go.
Hello, I'm courtney aspinall.
Hi. This is my mother,
Ellen aspinall,
And my agent, brian spiro,
From united talent.
What agency are you with?
Uh, chapman and chapman.
They find you at one of.
Those open auditions?
No. Where did they find you?
Eighth and 47th, okay?
Eh, courtney, Sweetheart,
Practice your lines.
I hate it When it's raining.
We don't get to go outside
For recess or ride our bikes.
After school.
That's funny, but you're not.
Gonna do it like that, are ya?
What do you mean?
They're just cookies.
Don't make it sound like
A commercial for hemorrhoids.
You are a very rude Young lady.
I was just trying
To be helpful.
Courtney aspinall,
We're ready for you now.
I see.
Allison, Sweetheart, uh...
Can we have a few minutes?
Courtney seems to have
Something in her eye.
All right.
Uh, then I'd like to introduce
Myself. I'm michael chapman...
From the chapman and chapman
Agency, although you may.
Remember me as...
Little mikey.
You're little mikey!
You remember.
Oh, remember?
I grew up on that show!
That's funny, so did I.
I didn't see you.
I used to watch you.
All the time.
You were so cute!
I'm still so cute!
Anyway, I'm now representing
This young lady over here...
And it would be such a... Well,
Gosh, a big break for us...
If you'd just let her
Read today, allison.
Uh, listen, I don't know.
These are the callbacks.
I have the head of the company
In there.
He's a totally Hands-on type.
Mm, eh, has she
Done anything before?
Here's her resumé.
Mom, I'm done!
How'd you do, honey?
This isn't very much.
Ya know, I hadn't done a thing
When I walked into those.
Life with mikey auditions.
And, uh, well, Hey, we all know.
How that turned out.
Ahhh, okay. Okay, great.
Angie vega,
This is mr. Corcoran,
The president and founder
Of sunburst cookies.
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Angie. You look very pretty.
Oh, you mustn't be frightened.
I'm just a little bit
Of a sportsman.
You're not a sportsman.
You're a murderer!
Well, shall we get started?
Angie, I'll read with you.
No, no, I, uh,
I'm not a murderer.
Every one of these animals
Was hunted legally.
And in accordance with the law.
Oh, I'm sure that's a
Big relief to the bear.
All her baby cubs are probably
Just sitting in their den,
Saying, "mom's stuffed on
A stand in manhattan.
But that's the law.
Let's just hibernate
And forget about it."
Finally!
You found a little girl
With some spirit!
So, michael,
Who's the new girl?
Why, you wanna steal her too?
I'll just leave now.
It's good to see you've reached
A new level of maturity.
Oh, bite me.
My point exactly.
Ya know what?
Can I tell you something?
You're just jealous 'cause
I got a kid with some talent.
And you can't get her.
Hey, how'd it go? Did
They laugh, they cry?
Nobody cried.
You know, chapman, you're right.
It's difficult not to be jealous
With someone who peaks at 15,
Does a couple of love boats
And a hollywood squares...
And winds up working for daddy
Because he can't get a job.
Anywhere else.
I also did a charlie's angels,
And you know that.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold the elevator.
Hey, hey, hey!
Angie, what are you doin'?
I'm glad I caught you. Can I
Speak to you for just a minute?
Yeah, what's up?
We have to finish The auditions.
Just as a courtesy.
We have been looking
For this girl for months.
But mr. Corcoran
Absolutely loved angie.
She got the job!
She got the job!
Yes! Okay!
N-no, shh!
I'm quiet, quiet.
Thank you.
No, no, no, Thank you.
Here's the paperwork.
We need to see angie for a
Costume fitting this friday.
Friday. You got it.
Yeah, what do you want?
Uh, is this the vega residence?
I'm looking For angie vega.
Lenny, who is it?
My name is michael chapman,
I'm a friend...
Hey! Angie!
What are you Doing here?
You got it. You are
The sunburst cookie girl.
Out of hundreds of kids,
They picked you.
When do I get the money?
You wanna try to hold down
The excitement a little bit?
When do we get the money?
After we shoot
The first commercial!
Listen, I gotta get your sister
To sign these documents.
I'll get 'em signed.
Angie?
I really wouldn't mind talkin'
To her, if that's okay...
Now's not a good time.
Uh, angie?
Listen, here's my home number.
Give me a call
When she signs 'em.
Congratulations!

Uh, that's me.
The lovelorn major.
I wanted-tell me

What is it?
Ahh, all right,
Just stay in character,

It's cold. Brr!
This can't be happening.
Here's all the stuff

Now?
Oh, and I also thought
I should bring this back.
Whose is this?
Mr. Cookieman's. Corcoran's.
I don't believe you!
I admit, it wasn't
such a great idea, but,
You know, you get in a habit.
Oh, huh, I didn't know
You had company.
Yeah.
Hello, I'm debbie.
Hi, I'm angie.
This place is disgusting.
Tell me about it.
Ah, she was just deliverin'
This stuff. Angie's a client.
Oh, really? Me too.
I thought he just
Represented kids.
No!
Is that true?
Kids of all ages
Is what she meant.
Huh! Well, no wonder
I've never gotten a job!
You're a kid's agent!
What are you saying,
You never got a job?
I got you that job
In the trojan women.
Oh, big deal!
One lousy production
In a theater in passaic?
And I had to make
The costumes too!
Debbie, debbie, debbie.
Any chance of getting time off
For good behavior?
No.
Debbie! D-debbie, d-don't go.
Nice meeting you, angie.
Debbie...
Uh, did I come At a bad time?
No, no. That was perfect.
Think I'd gotten
Just about everything
I could out of the evening.
So I was thinking,
I can't concentrate.
On the commercials at home...
With lenny
And all his stupid friends.
So I thought I'd stay here
Until we're done.
That's three weeks away.
So what?
So I don't think your sister's
Gonna be too happy about that.
Listen, I take better care
Of her than she does of me.
So don't worry about it.
She knows I'm here. It's cool.
It's not cool.
Can I tell you something?
I don't wanna be rude...
And I'm real sorry
About your domestic problems.
But this is
My lucky pac-man pillow,
This is my house,
This is your bag.
And that's the door.
I like my privacy.
More than your commission?
What, are you threatening me?
I don't respond well to threats.
I will not be threatened.
You are such a pig!
Yuck!
Yeah.
Do you know this girl?
Is she staying with you?
That depends. What did she do?
Huh! I found her
In the hall this morning,
Throwing out your garbage.
I'm sorry, mrs. Cantrell.
That won't happen again.
I hope it happens Every day.
Usually, the garbage
Just sits there,
Smelling up the whole place.
Not to mention
The cigarette butts.
Dear?
Don't you think it's time
To get ready for school?
Yeah, right. In my next life.
Look at this place!
Yeah. Thank you, Mrs. Cantrell.
Uuh!
Get away from me with that!
I'm about to have breakfast.
Uhh. Uhh! Ooh!
What?
I don't believe this!
You let her stay
In your apartment?
I don't understand you.
I really don't.
I thought you'd be happy.
We finally get the biggest job
We've had in years...
And you're upset 'cause
There's a few little problems.
A few little problems?
You said she doesn't go
To school.
She steals, she ran away
From home. We're now.
Representing the omen.
Did you check her head
For the little 666?
Yeah, there was only two sixes.
We got her just in time!
Miss briganti,
Announce me, please.
Certainly.
The cereal king is here.
Hi, barry.
Barry!
What an unexpected pleasure.
I wanna go skating.
Skating?
Who doesn't?
Ah, I'd love to take you.
Skating, barry, but we're
Still sort of working here.
Oh, is that right?
I bet brian spiro from
United talent would be willing.
To take me skating.
I bet that-va-va-vavoom!
Well, hello, dolly!

Accompany me to wollman rink,
My brown-eyed girl?
Get lost!

To tie these things.

Ya know, I was thinkin',
It's real cramped
At my apartment.
With angie there...
And, uh, you got that
Big house and everything...
Oh, forget it!
Look, it's no place
For a kid, ed.
I got various friends
Comin' over at all hours...
And I stay up late
And I play my music loud...
Oh, please.

You share with various.
Bimbos and a 32-inch tv.
We're talkin' about a lot
Of money here, and it's not.
Just gonna be these commercials.
This kid is very special.

The other guy doesn't have
A commercial to shoot tomorrow.
Neither does she with that face.
Ya know what's good?
A piece of steak.

All that makeup?
Your eye's all puffy.
Now, that's not gonna show up
On screen, is it?
We can't have that.
I don't think you're
Gonna have a problem...
What happened was-wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I was in the cafeteria yesterday
And I told a few people.
About the commercial.
And there was this one girl,
Sheila bersten.
She said sugar gems are better
Than sunburst cookies.
Sugar gems!
They're made with lard
And preservatives!
That's what I told her.
I said, "sunburst cookies
Are all natural.
No preservatives.
Just nature's own recipe."
And then she punched me.
Now, now, now, that's all right.
She was probably
Just a little jealous.
It all happened so fast.
There were cookies everywhere.
Now, don't you worry.
You're my girl.
Somebody cover up That eye.
Come along to makeup.
What a week!
First I lose my wallet.
Now this.
Action!
I hate it when it's raining.

Cut! Cut!
No problem. Keep it going.

Hold your positions.
Go talk to her.
Excuse me.
I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
Just relax, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
It would be easier
If you'd just let me talk.
Like a real person.
I hate it when it's raining.
I should have known.
It's my favorite little
Sunny friends."
I mean, it's like a cookie
For manic depressives.
Huh! Okay, it's stupid.
You're right,
It's a stupid line.
But it's no more Stupid than,
I hope little jimmy gets
A batman doll for christmas...
Because he really wants it,
Blah, blah, blah."
I mean, that's pretty stupid.
But that's what show business
Is all about:
Acting like an idiot.
It's not you,
You're just doin' your job.
You know what I mean?
Most people feel like idiots.
Most of the time...
But they don't Get paid for it.
Relax, you're gonna be fine.

Hello, I'm mrs. Gordon.
Are you mr. Chapman?
Yeah, I am.
And I just wanna
Tell you right now...
That we're claimin'
Self defense on this one.
Angela, I'm not amused.
Angela!
I want you and evan
To wait outside.
For a minute, please.
And no hitting.
I didn't hit him That hard!
She broke my retainer.
You gotta jab, buddy.
She'll get that
Overhand right in.
They're so cute at this age,
Aren't they?
Would you mind telling me
What your relationship.
Is to angela?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Angie... Angela, uh, is doing
A series of commercials.
For sunburst cookies...
And, uh, I'm her agent.
Although, right now,
I'm thinkin' about bein'
Her boxing promoter.
This isn't funny, mr. Chapman.
Please sit down.
We have a very serious
Problem here.
Now, angela
Is an extremely bright girl,
But she's also very lonely.
She eats lunch by herself
Every day. She barely talks.
To the other children.
No kidding. I had no idea.
That's because
She's not very good.
At expressing her feelings.
She either runs away Or hits.
So, instead of writing
A love letter...
Or drawing little hearts
On her notebooks.
Like the other girls,
She's going to give evan.
A concussion.
I... You mean, she, uh... Has
A crush on him.
And I know it's very sweet,
But... She's frightened and
Insecure and not sure.
Of how to be with
Other children.
She's become...
Really withdrawn...
And difficult since her
Mother passed away.
Listen, um, are you
Sure you wanna be.
Talkin' to me about this?
'Cause this... Really
Isn't my area.
Fine. You're the one
She told me to call.
But tell me, mr. Chapman,
Who should I be talking to?
Where is mikey? It's 8:30.
I'm really beginning
To get worried.
I hope he's not in
Any kind of trouble.
I never should have
Yelled at him.
Now, it's not your fault,
Helen.
The boy let the
Dog out of the yard.
I miss him.
We all miss mikey, honey.
I was talking about the dog!
Maybe we should call the police.
You're right.
What?
Merry christmas, everyone.
How come You never told me.
About your mother?
I don't want to talk
About my family, okay?
It's my business.
Since when does ed.
Want to see me on a weekend?
I don't know. He just
Said it was important.
What time you got?
I don't know.
Why don't you get A watch?
I haven't got time
To get a watch.
Get it? Get it?
Yo, bambi.
Hey, angie. Hey, michael.

Wrestlers are not really
That mean, you know.
They're just like hammy
Tv actors, which is why.
They didn't hurt me.
It's like a
Professional courtesy.
Those tickets must've
Cost you a lot of money.
They cost $237, but they
Didn't cost me anything.
It's coming out of your cut.
I think judy wasserman
Would make a great wrestler.
They could call her
The mermanator.
Hey, if you're not gonna wear.
That stole that barry
Gave you, do you mind.
If I borrow it?
Be my guest.
You and evan Set a date yet?
Shut up!
You really are 11, ang.
Enjoy it.
I know it was the
High point of my life.
I was thinking about...
Hey! What happened?
The corporate secretary called.
She said it was important
He see both of us right away.
You think?
He's making angie
The official spokesgirl.
Oh, look at this!
Hello, mr. C.
Mr. Corcoran,
Good to see you again.
Sit down, gentlemen!
Whoops!
Just gonna...
This is my attorney,
Mr. Norman feller.
Hey, norman.
Oh, pleasure
To meet you, norman.
I've always loved
That name, "norman."
That's nice.
Mr. Feller, would you
Tell these gentlemen...
What you've just told me?
Yes, sir.
Our legal department does the
Check into all the contractual.
Aspects of the commercials.
We discovered that the signature
On angie's contract...
Belongs to a janice vega,
Who is not her legal guardian.
Angie's actual guardian
Is her father, a richard vega.
No, that's, that's not,
That's not possible.
You told me
Her father was dead.
He's dead. He's dead!
Angie's father,
Who is very much alive,
Is at a rehab center upstate.
These commercials cost me
One-half million dollars.
And now I may not
Be able to air them!
I don't know what to say, sir.
We had no idea...
What do you do?
Pick up kids
From off the streets?
Now listen carefully!
If these contracts...
Are not on my desk by
Tomorrow morning, signed.
By angie's father,
You will pay for.
These commercials,
And then I will sue you...
For breach of contract,
Fraud and gross negligence!
Now believe me,
If you do not comply,
I will have your heads.
Now get out of my office!
Ohhh!
This is my fault.
I should never have
Listened to you.
Anyone who's stupid enough
To listen to you...
Deserves to wind up
In this situation.
Do me a favor, ed.
Don't make it sound like
I'm a complete moron.
She told me that her
Father was dead!
So what? Corcoran's right.
It was our job to know
She has a father!
I don't even know what
We're doing representing.
Her in the first place.
You are unbelievable!
Twenty minutes ago...
You were thrilled
When you thought the money.
Was gonna come rolling in.
Now don't be such a hypocrite,
All right, ed?
Don't tell me about the money!
You think because you
Go out and find one client.
In the past two years...
I should get down
On my knees and thank you?
I have kept this agency
Open for the past ten years!
If it wasn't for me, ed,
There wouldn't be an agency.
Well, that's old news, michael.
That was 15 years ago!
That excuse doesn't
Hold up anymore.
All right, fine. Fine.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go up to elmira.
I'm gonna get
The signature myself.
I'm gonna do it All by myself!
I'm gonna need your car
And some money for gas.
When was the last time.
You were behind the wheel?
I'm doing this. Why don't you
Go back to the office.
And call our lawyer?
What lawyer?
Eric the magician's father,
He's a lawyer, right?
Call him.
Eric the magician...
Oh, oh! Let me in.
All right. All right. I'm okay.
Let me in, I'll drive!
I'm okay, I'm okay! I'm okay!
Who cares about you?
I still have payments
On this car!
Michael, get out of the...
So that's when I decided that
The best thing to do would be...
Just to get in the car
And drive up here.
I... I appreciate what
You're doing for angie.
But I'm her father.
Why didn't you call me?
Well, angie never
Told me about you.
What do you mean?
Well... She said you were dead.
Oh.
I mean, I think she meant it
In the best sense of the word.
You know, like tired dead.
Dead tired. Pooped.
When my wife died,
I lost it. Okay?
I snapped, and this is something
Very difficult for me to admit,
But I was not there
For my daughters.
The way I should have been.
I... You don't have to
Explain to me. Listen.
My life has been going
Downhill for about 15 years.
I mean, at least you
Have daughters.
I have no kids.
I have no money.
I have no... Life.
I'm sorry, did I interrupt you?
No, go on.
I'm starting to feel better.
I'm starting to feel worse.
Well, maybe you should
Come here and stay for a while.
Actually this is a pretty good.
Place, and I'm feeling great.
When I get my family back,
I'll be all right.
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah.
Zip-a-dee-ay My, oh, my.
What a wonderful day
Plenty of sunshine.
Comin' my way zip...
Hey, chapman!
How're ya doin'?
I hope you're hungry
'Cause we're having spaghetti.
That is, if I can get it
Off the side of the pot.
Hey, ang?
Oh, and anna called.
She said you were supposed
To call her back friday.
Angie?
You really get around.
You a condom tester
Or something?
Angie!
I met your father today.
What did you say?
I said, I saw your dad today.
I went up to elmira.
How come you didn't
Tell me about him?
I hate my father.
I like him.
I can't believe you went up to
See him without asking me first.
You had no right to do that!
It wasn't exactly
A pleasure trip!
You know corcoran threatened
To sue me and ed if we didn't.
Get your father's signature?
You could've told me first!
If you had been honest with me,
We wouldn't even be having.
This conversation right now.
You gotta stop lying, ang.
Don't give me that.
You lie all the time. I do not.
No?
You lied to ed about me
When we first went.
Up to the office. Right?
And then you made up.
Some fake resumé for me.
And then... You lie
To your girlfriends.
That's different. Yeah, right.
It's okay for you to lie.
Look, the point is your
Dad's worried about you...
And he wants to talk to you.
And he thinks you should
Go back to your house.
He said he would make
Sure lenny moves out.
He's your father, ang.
I think you should
Do what he says.
Fine. I'll leave now.
I'm not saying you
Should leave now.
No, I want to.
Will... Will you just
Calm down for a second?
Maybe we can sit down
And discuss this!
There's nothing to discuss.
Everybody's already
Decided what I should do.
I mean, don't bother
Asking me or anything.
We haven't decided
What you should do.
It's just that...
If you get together and
Talk, maybe you could.
Work it out with him.
I'm just trying To help, ang!
You can't help me.
You can't even help yourself.
Look at you!
You're disgusting,
You live like a pig...
And you think you're
Real charming and cute.
And that everybody loves you.
But you're 31,
You have no money and you.
Walk around telling everybody...
About some stupid
Television show you were on.
That nobody cares about anymore.
You're a has-been.
Don't be mean, angie.
If you wanna talk, We'll talk,
But don't be mean.
I don't wanna talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
I did the commercials.
I get my money, you get
Your money and that's it.
Everybody's happy.
Wait a minute. Angie!
Just leave me alone.

Ed in the office?

He's in with mrs. Corman.
Am I interrupting anything?
Oh, none of your concern.
Mrs. Corman was
Just in the middle of.
Giving us the axe...
On behalf of barry.
Oh!
I tried to talk to him,
But he would not budge.
He's just sold
On this mr. Spiro.
Can I say something?
Excuse me if I'm out of line,
But I can't believe,
After all these years together,
That barry couldn't come up here.
And just tell us this himself.
He's in disney world
With mr. Spiro.
It was his christmas present.
Well, I won't keep you.
I know you must have
More pressing matters.
To discuss than barry.
Yeah, I gotta Call the movers.
Well, good-bye, gentlemen.
I hope we can still be friends.
All right,
Let's not panic, okay?
We still got money coming in.
No, we don't.

Come on.
At the next open audition, some
Terrific tyke is gonna come in.
We're gonna be right back.
Michael, I'm gonna
Work for uncle larry.
No, ed!
You're not gonna change my mind.
Please... Don't make this harder
For me than it already is.
I love you,
I'll miss working with you,
I'll even miss this
Godforsaken place,
But I've got no choice.
What am I supposed to do?
Huh? What about me?
You'll be fine! Maybe this
Will turn out to be the best.
Thing for the both of us.
That's easy for you to say, ed.
You've got a job,
Degrading though it may be.
I have to go out
And I can't tell you why.
Geena, what?
Well, if you're gonna
Beat it outta me, I'll tell ya.
Angie's at lord and taylor's.
She was caught shoplifting,
And she needs somebody.
To get her out.
Mr. Chapman,
You be nice to her.
I can't talk now,
We're having a party.
I will call you later, yes.
I'm gonna pick everything up.
All right.
I love you too. Bye.
Hi. My name is michael chapman.
I'm looking for angie vega.
And?
Shoplifter.
Ah, yes.
What are you doing here?
Could we have a minute?
Thanks.
Yeah.
I called for geena, not you.
Just go away, okay?
Just calm down, all right?
It's not geena's fault.
I had to drag it out of her.
Can I leave now?
What's wrong with you? Huh?
I mean, why do you do this?
Just forget About it, okay?
You don't need the money.
Yes, I do!
Lenny stole my paycheck
And disappeared, okay?
You happy now?
No. No. I still don't know
What you need so bad.
That you gotta steal it.
What, a bottle of perfume?
It's a christmas present.
For janice.
Who's the watch for?
Since when do you need a watch?
You know how you never
Know what time it is?
Well, this way you won't
Be late to appointments,
Ed wouldn't get Mad, and...
And maybe... I could
Stay with you.
Angie!
Didn't you like it
When I was there?
Yeah, you know I did.
Then what's the problem?
It was a temporary situation.
That's why it was fun.
I'm not your father.
I know that. My father left me.
You think he wanted to?
He left so he could
Get better and come back.
And take care of you.
How do you know that?
Have I ever steered you wrong?
I told you you would be
Terrific in commercials,
And you were.
I told you to go to school,
And look how well you're doing.
I told you to talk to evan,
And now he's deeply.
In love with you.
Shut up.
I think you're.
On television!
Oh, yeah. Well,
That's possible. I used to...
No, not you. Her!
On the commercial!
On the tv commercial. Come on!
Hurry up, you're gonna miss it!

Excuse us.
Excuse us. Hey!
Yes!
Oh, my god!

But if you're gonna
Steal a present,
Isn't this a beauty?

Why are you suddenly
So nice to me, my lady in red?
Well, there was something
I wanted to talk to you about.
I just heard

I think you should
Go back with them.

Makin' you dizzy?
Listen to me, dream boat.
Those guys are bums,
They're losers.
They couldn't get
Castro a job in cuba.
Come here, barry.
I wanna whisper
Something in your ear.
You listen to me!
You think you're
Gonna be 12 forever?
You're not. You're gonna get
Bigger and uglier and hairier.
And in a few years when
Nobody'll hire you, spiro'll.
Drop you like a hot potato.
But michael and ed will
Always be there for you.
Okay, okay!

Should get here right away.
She probably
Broke another nail.
