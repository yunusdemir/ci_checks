You're gonna sit there

Don't you, daddy?
- Leave me outta this.
Your daddy may not mind,
but your mama do.
I'm goin' with your father

When I come home,
the house better be clean.

That's disgusting. You better

Sorry.
Clinton!
Have you lost your mind?
What?
Didn't I tell you
I wanted the kitchen clean?
Get up!
Get up now!
What time is it?
It's 4:00. Get up.
Get your butt in there.
It's not fair...

Hey! Wendell. Wendell!
Don't play with me, boy.

Get, get downstairs.

Your daddy ain't here.
Get up.
<i>Can't we do it in the morning?</i>
Everybody, up against the wall.
From now on, everybody's gonna

Do you understand me?
Why you

You make me crazy!
Boy, I'll slap the black

You ain't slappin' me.
I will slap...

You're gonna start

Get downstairs now. Go!
Get outta my face.
Get outta my face

Shh! And do not
wake your father!
You're waking everybody up.
Shh! You know
why I'm screaming,
don't you?
All because...
no, child,
I am not crazy.
You are gonna be crazy
once I beat your brains
outta your head.
<i>My brains?</i>
<i>You ain't beatin'</i>
<i>my brains outta my head.</i>
I'm crazy 'cause I got
five of y'all that have
run me stark raving mad!
This ain't no plantation!
<i>I know it ain't!</i>
I'm not a slave!
Nobody said you was.
And I'll tell you
one damn thing: I certainly
am not a plaything.
You understand me?
What am I supposed to do?
You're supposed to have
done what I told you.
Mommy, Clinton only washes
one plate and one fork
and one knife.
<i>Shut up, heifer!</i>
Don't be a tattletale.
Don't call her a heifer.
Clinton, you are gonna wash
every fork, plate, spoon,
pot, pan, our drawers,
mutley for a month.
What about Wendell and Nate?
They never do nothin'.
Yes, I do!
I empty the garbage!
You worry about
your own shiftless self.
You get busy!
Mommy, I'm hungry.
That's too bad.
The kitchen is closed.
You should've ate
more than three peas.
[ Nate and Wendell ]
"I ate three peas."
Shut up.
Clinton. What kind of
example are you setting,
being the oldest?
Can you hear me?
Yes.
You are so immature!
I hate doing...
when you finish mashing peas
into the floor, mop.
I'd rather have a father
than a mother any day.
Yeah, any day.
What'd you say?
<i>What did you say?</i>
He said,
"I'd rather have a father

Dang!
Take your father!
Take your father! Let's see

Come here.
<i>[ Mom ] Mornin', ladybug.</i>

Fine.

No, thank you.
Troy, I was wonderin'.
How would you like to go down

With cousin viola in Virginia
after school's out?
<i>Aunt song and Uncle clem</i>

- No, thank you.
- What are you gonna do
this summer?
I don't know.
<i>I'm teachin' summer school.</i>
<i>You can't be runnin'</i>
<i>up and down the street after</i>

Would I miss my birthday?
You would spend it with them.
That would be good.
That would be great.

It might have made up

You should be shot.

Oh, you'll see.
Look. Look.
Look at him

I caught him

He does no such thing.
Yes, it's him...

Yours is filthy.
You don't know nothin'

Keep them inside

You killed my mother!

Be quiet!
You can't tell me...

Take your dog-smelling ass

Want some candy?
<i>What's in that bag?</i>
- Psych your mind.
Make you Booty shine.
- Eggies. Thumbs up.
I called no eggies first.
Thumbs down.
<i>When?</i>
- When I bought it.
- That don't count 'cause
we couldn't hear it. Eggies!
- Y'all never give me nothin'.
- Shut up, you evil,
flat-chested wench.
You're not getting any, and
I'm telling ma you called me
an evil, flat-chested wench.
Go ahead. Tell.
You are an evil,

Joseph, how can
you live with this?
Please change your vote.
No, I'm watching

Joseph is not
changing his vote.
Besides, we outnumber you.
After this show, we'll be
watching the Knicks.

<i>Dejame!</i>
I'm gonna tell
your mother.
Tell her.
[ Indistinct Spanish ]
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Hey!
What are you doing?
Huh?
I'm talking to you.
What are you doing?
Huh?
You think you can come
into my store and steal?
Huh? Do I go into
your house and take things?
No.
No.
Ten cents.
Ten cents!
I don't have any money.
What? No money?
[ Speaking Spanish ]
Send her to jail.
No money, huh?
Then get outta here,
and don't come back until
you got some money, okay?
What took you so long?
You let him catch you?
What was I
supposed to do?
You should have told him...
"I don't have to
steal nothin' from you.
I just forgot my money."
Oh.
Next time, steal
somethin' easier.
Yeah! My main man!
Walt "Clyde" Frazier.
<i>We better win tonight.</i>
<i>[ Sportscaster ]</i>
<i>It's a very important game.</i>
<i>Stupid!</i>
<i>Why you go and pass the ball</i>
<i>to him?</i>
<i>Jackson ain't nothin'.</i>
<i>Lucky rebound.</i>
<i>He can't even dribble.</i>
Pass it to Frazier
before it passes to anybody.
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Yeah, stupid.</i>
<i>Pass it to Frazier!</i>
Come on.
<i>[ Sportscaster ]</i>
<i>Five seconds.</i>
<i>Take it to the hoop!</i>
<i>Jump shot!</i>
It's good!
I knew he would make it in.
That's number one right there.
<i>[ Sportscaster ]</i>
<i>Frazier with 24 points.</i>
<i>[ Clinton ] Oh, man!</i>
<i>[ Game continues</i>
<i>indistinctly ]</i>
Only one way to find out.
<i>[ Clinton ]</i>
<i>Get the ball.</i>
<i>What you waiting for, stupid?</i>
¶
Damn it, Woody, you
bounced another cheque.
I thought we had it covered.
[ Sighs ] I'll get some money.
When?
When? What do you think
I'm doin' right here?
Gem, let me just
finish this music.
That's what
I've always done.
The problem is...
Your music's not bringin'
anything into the house
but music.
Gem, the money will come.
I'm waitin'.
I'm back teachin' school
again, and I am waitin'.
Just keep doin'
what you're doin', gem.
Now you know
it wasn't always like this.
I made money before.
I'll make money again.
I trust you, but
you have got to realize...
We are on a limited budget.
I am trying
to balance everything,
and when you write cheques
and don't tell me about it,
it makes it
extremely difficult.
As God is my witness,
I want the best for
you and the children.
But I have got to do it
in my own way.
Look it...
cool?
Cool. I went out and opened
a separate bank account.
That supposed to get
some kind of reaction
from me?
What is that supposed to prove?
I don't know what it proves.
I'm interested in putting food
on the table and keepin'
a roof over our kids' heads.
Boy! You know,
y-y-you really kill me.
<i>I mean, on the one hand,</i>
<i>you come down here...</i>
<i>Tellin' me about</i>
<i>yet another mistake</i>
<i>Woody done made.</i>
But when I'm
sittin' at that piano,
tryin' to do my work,
tryin' to concentrate,
you won't let me do that
neither.
You got a beef with that.
I don't know what to do.
<i>You can get up off my chair.</i>
I don't want to talk about
your mistakes. You keep track
of those. I don't have time.
<i>All I ask you</i>
<i>is to write down when you</i>
<i>spend the money I am making.</i>
I told you it was
a legitimate mistake.
<i>I appreciate that,</i>
but you have made that mistake
five times this month.
<i>I just want you</i>
<i>to change the pattern.</i>
I don't need no lecture...
About how to conduct
myself in this house.
<i>I am asking you...</i>
To help me conduct
the business affairs
of this family!
<i>What the hell...</i>
Do you think I'm tryin' to do?
<i>I don't know what you're doin'.</i>
Well, let me tell you.
I got to be like a thief
in the night in this house...
Every time I want
some privacy to do my work.
You selfish child!
Don't tell me about privacy.
Selfish nothin'!
<i>I can't even</i>
<i>take a piss...</i>
Without six people
hangin' off my tits.
You a big Saint around here,
and I ain't shit.
<i>Call yourself what you want to.</i>
- I just asked you
to write down the cheque.
- I wrote the cheque, right?
I wrote the stupid thing.
I think you can do two things
at once: Make music and write.
Woody... wrote...
A... bum...
Cheque.
- Here.
- That's very cute.
You remember to write it down
before it bounces next time.
You know, you seem to forget...
I'm the one used to pay
for you and the children
to go to bloomingdale's...
And lord & Taylor
to get what you wanted
when you wanted.
<i>- [ Clinton shouting ]</i>
<i>- You ain't the only one</i>
<i>contributed to this family.</i>
It's a foul!
Where the referee?
[ Indistinct ]
<i>Clinton!</i>
What?
Don't answer me "what."
Turn the goddamn TV off.
- I'm watchin' the Knicks!
- I don't care what it is.
No TV on a school night!
She can scream all she want.
I'm watchin' this game.
<i>- Hey! No TV! Turn it off!</i>
- Mom, it's just a game.
- Who is that?
<i>- That was Nate.</i>
- It wasn't me, mommy!
<i>If the TV's not off,</i>
<i>I'm whippin' everybody.</i>
<i>[ Joseph ]</i>
<i>Troy! I have to</i>
<i>go to the bathroom!</i>
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>
<i>Open up before</i>
<i>I pee on myself.</i>
<i>Come on, Troy!</i>
<i>[ Knocking ]</i>
<i>Troy! What are you doing?</i>
Come on!
Open the door!
If you ever chastise your boys.
Hey! Clinton, don't
let me get up there!
<i>Clinton!</i>
<i>[ Joseph ]</i>
<i>Troy!</i>
In a minute!
Walt Frazier's
not payin' my bills!
<i>It ain't about Walt Frazier!</i>
[ Carolyn ]
I'm sick of this shit.
<i>Troy! Troy!</i>
Surprise, boys.
I'm watchin' the game!
Boy, I'll knock you out.
What's the big deal?
I said no TV on a
school night, damn it!
The Knicks got a job.
You need an education.
I will throw
this idiot box
out the window.
Troy, let boogie
in the bathroom.
She won't let me
watch the game.
How dare you
go to your father
to defy me, boy!
Let him
watch the game.
Woody, don't touch me.
Come on, gem.
Get your hands off of me.
Troy won't let me
go to the bathroom.
Shut up!
<i>I</i> own this mammy-jammy
house. I pay con ed
for the electricity.
When you start payin'
the bills, everybody else
gets to decide...
When you
put the TV on
and when not.
I'm watchin' this game.
Boy, I'm gonna
knock you out!
Get off me!
[ Screaming, shouting ]
<i>¶ [ "I'll take you there" ]</i>
Hey, Troy!
[ Shouting, screaming ]
Everybody, stop!
Stop!
What I want...
Is some respect for my work...
In this house.
You get out of my house.
You call your brother,
and you tell him to
come and get your shit.
That's just fine.
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.
<i>[ Nate ]</i>
<i>See what you did?</i>
<i>See what you started?</i>

It wasn't my fault.

Nate's upstairs with mommy,
and Clinton's in his room.
Okay, boogie, I'm
gonna see you soon.
<i>I'm gonna wait for you.</i>
No, come on.
Come on now. No.
We talked about this.
You're gonna be a big man.
I'll put you in a big chair.
Like that? Hmm?
V-v-v-oom.

<i>[ Door closes ]</i>
Good morning, mommy.
How are you today?
I'm fine.
Thank you, ladybug.
I made you some breakfast.
I see.
Thanks.
All y'all mad at me?
Nah.
<i>[ Door buzzer ]</i>
I'll get it.
Hi, daddy.
Hey.
Where's mommy?
In her room.
Come here.
I want to talk to you.
Guess what?
I cleaned the kitchen,
and I made mommy breakfast.
That's great.
I think
she's feeling better now.
That's good.
Troy, your father's sorry
about last night.
It's not your fault, daddy.
You know daddy doesn't
want to fight or yell
or scream or holler.
All daddy wants to do
is play his music.
That's all.
Maybe if you played
other people's music...
Mommy wouldn't
scream and yell at you.
I can't do that any more, Troy.
I got to work on my music now.
Well, maybe you should
just go for taking her
out on a date.
You think so, huh?
I do.
Hey, listen,
<i>this is for you</i>
<i>and your brothers.</i>
- What, you don't like
candy no more?
- No, I do.
I want you to give this
to your mother for me.
<i>Okay?</i>
Sure.
- Everybody else
doin' all right?
- Yeah. I think.
All right,
miss coomish mimmish.
Come here.
Hey.
Your father loves you, Troy.
I love you too, daddy.
Ah.
These are from daddy.
You could at least open this.
He told me to tell you
he wants to take you out
on a date.
Candy from dad.
Can I have a quarter?

They're very valuable,

Did you take them?
No.

No!

<i>How's your mother?</i>
<i>[ Greg ] She's okay.</i>
What's wrong?
Troy. She's always

She teases me about school.
She calls my mother names.
<i>She treats me mean.</i>
<i>She makes fun of me</i>

<i>It's not fair.</i>

Mommy, somebody left

I almost fell in again.
Never mind about that now.
I do not believe

- Mommy, I didn't.
Don't lie to me. Why is

There's enough candles
in here, I know that.
Yeah, we, uh...
we havin' some financial
problems right now.
<i>We understand.</i>
<i>I was hopin' that</i>
<i>the food stamps would help.</i>
Um, anyway... oh.
Like I was sayin'...
here you go, Vic.
We, uh...
we didn't blow no fuse.
Uh, the damn electricity
been cut off.
What?
Yeah.
Drag, man.
- Come again?
- We ain't got no electricity,
and neither do you.
You know I need my lights.
Can't sleep, can't think,
can't read without my lights.
It won't be for long.
<i>How I'm supposed to cook</i>
<i>without no lights?</i>
Probably just
a couple of days 'til
we can get it straight.
A couple of days?
Ain't that a bitch.
Payin' you good money
for rent, and I ain't
got no damn lights?
Well, now,
that's what I'm sayin'.
I give y'all some candles.
Forget candles.
You don't understand
what you're dealin' with.
M-my disability requires
that I have my light.
Well, I know it's
an inconvenience, Vic.
It's an inconvenience
to everybody.
But I'm gonna go down there
tomorrow, and I'm gonna
straighten it out, okay?
<i>I hope you don't</i>
<i>expect us to pay rent.</i>
<i>Si no hay luz,</i>
<i>no hay renta:</i>
No lights, no rent.
Well, now, miss Jessica,
I don't know 'bout no "us,"
'cause you don't even
live here,
but I do expect
you to pay, Vic.
Now I don't live here?
You gonna let him
say that to me?
[ Speaking Spanish ]
I don't live here now?
I think I done paid
enough, mr c.
I got enough shrapnel
in my back, I'm afraid
to get wet.
I think I done paid
far too damn much.
Now hold up now, Vic.
You know I don't want
no hollerin' and screamin'.
<i>I don't mean no disrespect...</i>
<i>To you or</i>
<i>your cares, mr c.</i>
Okay.
I think my rent has put
just as much food on
your baby's table as you do.
- Well, now, okay...
- I did not have to give
your wife those food stamps.
Vic, let's go.
Just forget about it, okay?
I can't live like this no more.
<i>[ Jessica muttering</i>
<i>in Spanish ]</i>
Now, at least y'all still
got gas and hot water.
<i>[ Jessica</i>
<i>muttering ]</i>
Okay, Vic?
It's good, baby.
I like eatin'
by candlelight.
Kind of romantic.
- Are you wooin' me?
- It wouldn't do me much good
right about now, would it?
<i>This is fun.</i>
Does this mean
we can't watch TV?
That's right.
- No cartoons.
- No <i> Brady bunch</i> or
<i>partridge family...</i>
<i>- For Troy and Nate.</i>
- Hey, nigger, I don't
watch that show.
- You do so watch that show.
- Liar.
- Nigger.
- Stop calling
each other nigger.
And you can't watch the Knicks.
Come on.
Let's just eat in peace.
Daddy's got some good news.
I'm giving a solo concert.
- [ Clinton ] Great.
<i>- [ Troy ] Wow! Daddy!</i>
<i>This is the one, gem.</i>
<i>This one's gonna be</i>
<i>real special.</i>
<i>Clinton, Wendell and Nate?</i>
<i>I need y'all to get out,</i>
<i>put up some posters for daddy.</i>
<i>- Can you do that?</i>
- All right.
- That's fine with me.
Don't worry. I'm
gonna take care of the house.
Everything's gonna
be all right.
Thank you, Tommy.
And call those numbers
if you need us.
You see anybody
actin' suspiciously
around the house,
you stand on that top step,
and you sing, okay?
I'll see you
when you come back.
You'll scare off
the whole neighbourhood.
Drive safe, all right?
Take care. Bye.
Okay.
No one's gonna step on
this stoop, I'll tell ya.
All right, bye-bye.
Have a safe trip.
Bye-bye!
Y'all didn't say bye to Tony.
Tommy LA LA

Why'd you tell him that?
<i>¶ [ "Tears of a clown" ]</i>

It's not funny.
¶ Roll on down

I'll tell mommy.
¶ Now Troy's gonna be

that same old song?
- Y'all don't like my song?
- [ All ] No!
<i>You know, I'm glad</i>
<i>the kids are comin' South.</i>
<i>I'm tired.</i>
<i>Don't know what's wrong,</i>
<i>but I'm tired.</i>
<i>Woody, we need</i>
<i>to make some changes.</i>
The money I'm bringin' in
is not makin' ends meet.
<i>I need your help.</i>
You want me to, uh,
pick up a guitar and
play some rock 'n' roll?
Yes.
If it'll help pay con ed, yes.
[ Sighs ]
This concert's gonna change
a lot of things for us, gem.
Plus it's gonna bring in
a nice piece of change.
<i>Who's gonna come but us,</i>
<i>Uncle brown, aunt Maxine</i>
<i>and our friends?</i>
People are gonna come to
this concert. People still
want to hear good music.
I don't give a damn how many
records rock 'n' roll sells.
People know the difference...
Between that
and good, pure music.
I need you
to support me
in this, carolyn.
Oh... looka here.
Who gets up
at the crack of dawn...
Monday through Friday,
cookin' breakfast,
go to school,
teach school, come home,
cook dinner, grade papers,
make lesson plans,
try to keep our rowdy kids
from killin' each other...
Just so you can be
a "pure" musician
playin' "pure" music?
If that ain't support,
I don't know what the hell...
what is.
<i>Thank you.</i>
[ Coughs ]
You woke up Troy.
You satisfied?
What's the matter?
Can't you sleep?
<i>No.</i>
You want to come
up here with us?
Yeah.
Oh, whoa.
You have long legs.
Whoo, miss coomish mimmish.
Troy, aren't you the lucky one.
Aunt song and Uncle clem
said viola's beside herself
that you're comin' down here.
<i>[ Troy ]</i>
<i>When am I</i>
<i>coming home?</i>
In a few weeks.
Will the lights
be back on?
Oh, yeah, baby.
All the lights
will be back on.
I don't wanna go.
Troy, come on,
come on.
You're gonna have
a wonderful time.
Please? Just this once?

Whoa.
<i>[ Women talking</i>

<i>I'm sure y'all are tired.</i>
<i>Lord, have mercy.</i>
Y'all done brought

Oh, viola,

- Family room?
- Man! You sure got
a clean house.
<i>Oh, isn't that cute. Clem,</i>
<i>you hear what Clinton said?</i>
- Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
- I'm Wendell.
- I'm Clinton.
Well, shut my mouth wide open.
<i>Oh, carolyn, I just love</i>
<i>yours and Troy's hair.</i>
<i>Will you look at that?</i>
All those little
tiny braids and things.
What y'all call that?
Braids.
Oh, no, sugar. We don't
let the dogs in here.
This carpet's too nice.
Boy, take that dog outside.
Put him in the car.
<i>What?</i>
Nate.
Come on, mutley.
<i>Viola, ain't you</i>
<i>gonna say hello</i>
<i>to your cousin Troy?</i>
Troy, you didn't say hi?
- Hi.
- Hi.
<i>She's just a little shy.</i>
Get off the couch.
Woody!
<i>I could use some coffee.</i>
Oh, shoot, I don't mind.
We are all family.
Who's hungry?
I got some fried chicken
and potato salad in
the kitchen right out there.
Oh, man!
Hey!
<i>[ Woody ]</i>
<i>You ain't changed.</i>
<i>You have not changed.</i>
<i>[ Song ]</i>
<i>Go on.</i>
Come on, Troy.
Aunt song,
you sure can cook.
Why, thank you, sugar.
Lord, Troy, you don't know
how happy we are to have you
here with us.
Troy, we're gonna
have us some fun.
Carolyn,
<i>Troy can stay</i>
<i>as long as she wants.</i>
Oh, song, that's so nice.
Troy,
isn't that nice?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Woody, we need
to get on the road.
We still have to
drop Nate off at
Trudy and boo's.
All right, y'all.
Finish your plates.
We got about two hours to go.
[ Clem ]
How soon you gettin'
back to New York?
This food's good.
Day after tomorrow.
Will you please try and
cooperate with everybody...
And get along
with everybody?
I don't want to stay here.
Troy, you're gonna
have a great time.
I wish I was stayin'.
Just don't leave me here.
I hardly know these people.
They're your relatives.
Come on.
I'm the one you ought to
feel sorry for. I have to go
up there with all those boys.
Thank you!
Goodbye!
[ All chattering ]
Bye, Troy!
[ Woody ]
I love you, baby.
Bye! See you.
<i>Take care</i>
<i>of yourself.</i>
Bye, little Joe.
<i>[ Song ] Let's go</i>
<i>inside, Troy.</i>
Please don't leave me.
Mommy, don't leave me.
Come on, Troy.
Let's go inside, baby.
[ Horn toots ]
When you're
getting dressed for bed,
I have often heard it said...
<i>Before you go to sleep, you</i>
<i>have to put away your clothes,</i>
[ snarling ]
<i>Because if you're</i>
<i>going to do things,</i>
<i>do things right.</i>
<i>[ Song ]</i>
<i>Queenie,</i>
is mama's baby
gonna be nice to Troy?
Troy, honey, where
are your pyjamas?
<i>[ Record continues ]</i>
<i>May I be excused?</i>
<i>And they'll say...</i>
<i>"Yes!" To you.</i>
Lord, have mercy, honey.
You can't wear these.
Viola, give Troy one of your
nighties. I'm gonna throw
these things in the garbage.
<i>Yes, mama.</i>
<i>[ Record ]</i>
<i>Get up. Wake up.</i>
<i>Get there on time</i>
<i>for school.</i>
<i>Don't you be late.</i>
<i>Find your place.</i>
<i>Win the race.</i>
Here, Troy.
<i>Go change in the</i>
<i>bathroom, sugar.</i>
Sugar, you ain't got
a thing to hide with
your skinny self.
Thinner than a blade of grass.
- Viola, you got
your bra on?
- Yes.
Come on.
All right, you rascals,
let's say our prayers.
Viola, put queenie
on the floor.
[ Both ]
Now I lay me
down to sleep.
I pray the lord
my soul to keep.
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the lord
my soul to take.
Amen.
All right, now,
I want you two
right to sleep.
All right. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
So glad you're here, Troy.
We gonna have lots of fun.
Good night, hon.
Good night, daddy.
- Good night, Troy.
- Good night, Uncle clem.
Night-night.
I ain't no <i> puta.</i>
I keep my pyjamas clean.
<i>I ain't no</i> puta.
<i>I keep my pyjamas clean.</i>
[ Giggling ]
I keeps my pyjamas clean.
<i>[ Song ]</i>
<i>Viola, what's</i>
<i>that noise in there?</i>
Nothin', mama.
You better stop jumpin'...
<i>Before she comes in.</i>
I don't care.
I hate this place anyway.
Besides, my dog could kill
your little rat dog.
I don't care either,
and it ain't my dog;
It's mama's dog.
You like livin' in Brooklyn?
A lot better than here.
You should come visit me.
Good. I like aunt carolyn.
<i>It's okay if</i>
<i>you don't like</i>
<i>aunt song.</i>
She's not my real mother.
I was adopted.
You were?
What's that funny noise
outside?
- You ain't never heard
crickets before?
- Good night.
Lord, have mercy, child.
You sure got
one thick head of hair.
You need a hot comb
on these naps.
You ain't got good hair
like my baby.
[ Hair sizzling ] Ow!
Now don't tell me you got
the nerve to be tender-headed
with these naps.
[ Chuckling ]
What's those things
you and your mother had?
Beads and braids.
Beads and braids.
Lord, have mercy.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

I am going to make you
a great big birthday cake.

Chocolate!
<i>Oh, no, sugar.</i>
I can't do chocolate.
The last time I did,
viola broke out in hives.
- No, I didn't. <i> You</i> did.
- Viola, don't
argue with your mother.
You see, clem?
I say it's white;
She say it's black.

she didn't get no hives,
she didn't get no hives.

<i>Last night we had yet another</i>

<i>Vic Powell didn't slap him</i>
<i>this time. Your father</i>
<i>was there, thank God.</i>
<i>Wendell has been telling me</i>
<i>that every morning Tony throws</i>
<i>trash from his sidewalk...</i>
<i>Onto our stoop.</i>
<i>We finally caught him</i>
<i>red-handed.</i>
What the hell you
think you're doin'?
Throwing this trash back.
Who told you to throw it here
in the first place?
How do you know it was us?
You did it to your own
stink house.
I know exactly what happened.
You're the one who's
always throwin' garbage.
<i>[ Carolyn ]</i>
<i>You know how it is</i>
<i>on our block.</i>
<i>A little shouting starts.</i>
<i>Before you know it, you got</i>
<i>a big crowd wantin' a show.</i>
- [ Arguing ]
- Wendell,
what's goin' on?
Caught him
throwin' trash
over there.
I expect more from a grown man.
What do you think you're doin'?
Your children are constantly
over here throwin' their trash
on my property.
- True.
- And furthermore,
they go on the roof,
and throw rocks
down on my dogs.
- Untrue.
- Machine gun, machine gun,
machine gun!
[ Shouting ]
Are you doing this?
Are you gonna
believe this man?
Yeah, you gonna believe
this stinky over us?
My children are doing
no such thing. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself.
You should start
actin' like an adult and
cut this foolishness out.
Tony, I hate to tell you this,
but your house stinks.
That's the truth.
Why you house stink, man?
[ All laughing ]
- [ Speaking Spanish ]
- Hey, you up there.
Hey, mr ♪4.
<i>Mira, mira.</i>
<i>Where's my rent?</i>
I want to talk to you.
<i>When you gonna</i>
<i>pay the rent?</i>
You want me to, I'll come over.
I'll help try

this situation got to stop.
I smell your animals
all in my house.
You understand me?
Okay.
Here.
<i>[ Carolyn ] Aren't you glad</i>
<i>to be away from these crazy</i>
<i>people in crooklyn, New York?</i>
And now, about your father.
<i>It started with Clinton.</i>
<i>You're the eldest.</i>
<i>I expect more from you,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna let you</i>
<i>make your own decision.</i>
Man, why did daddy have to
have his concert tonight,
the night of
the nba championships?
- Dang!
- Which is more important?
<i>[ Browne ]</i>
<i>All right! Nice!</i>
<i>Was that some new stuff</i>
<i>tonight, brother?</i>
Yeah, man.
<i>[ Carolyn ]</i>
<i>You ought to</i>
<i>record it, Woody.</i>
I plan to. I also started
working on my folk opera.
<i>[ Maxine ]</i>
<i>Folk opera?</i>
<i>About what, Woody?</i>
What you laughin' at?
Jessica was laughing.
She's from the city.
My folk opera is about me
growin' up in Alabama.
<i>[ Browne ]</i>
<i>All right. You got</i>
<i>the material for it.</i>
You know that's right.

Doin' it right!
We were all trying very hard
to lift your father's spirits.
And it was working, until:
<i>[ Door slamming ]</i>
The Knicks are world champs.
We got some ice cream
and cake right here.
Clinton.
<i>I'm not hungry.</i>
<i>[ Footsteps ascending stairs ]</i>
And the Knicks won.
How 'bout that?
<i>[ Carolyn ]</i>
<i>I've enclosed some gifts</i>

send you those?
Mm-hmm.
They're jade.
Oh.
<i>Aren't they pretty.</i>
<i>What are they?</i>
<i>Little elephants?</i>
Look, mama. Aunt carolyn
sent me some also.
Oh, well, viola,
you don't have pierced ears.
-You know how I
feel about that.
-But Troy has pierced ears.
Well, Troy was also
wearin' them funny...
Braids and beads
and shells and things.
- You don't ever let me
do what I want to do.
- I want to go home.
- Beg pardon?
- I'm going home.
<i>Now, Troy, no need</i>

Everybody has
a little argument
now and then.
Uh, your aunt song didn't
mean nothin' about your
hair and your earrings.
- Did you, honey?
<i>- [ Troy ] I don't care!</i>
- See what you did?
- Lord, have mercy. Troy!
How would it look
if you left now?
Aunt song has
a big mouth sometimes.
You want your folks

scared you back up north?
If she goes, I go.

Queenie?
Where are you, baby?
[ Laughing ]
Stop that!
Please!
- Did you find her, mama?
- I just don't understand
where my baby is.
It's not like queenie
just to up and disappear.
Why, lord, why?
- She'll be back, aunt song.
- Don't worry.
Queenie'll show up.
It's gettin' late, y'all.
Everybody have enough
ice cream and cake?
- [ All ] Yes.
- Everybody brush their teeth
and wash their hands?
- [ All ] Yes.
- All right, help me

Come on. Move!

Hi.
Welcome home.
Hi.
Hi.
How do, miss
coomish mimmish?
How was your flight?
Good. Where's daddy?
<i>He had to go</i>
<i>to rehearsal.</i>
Your mother asked us
to pick you up.
Here's a little gift.
She didn't want to ride?
<i>Naw, she was busy.</i>
- What happened to your hair?
- Aunt song didn't like my
braids, and she took 'em out.
<i>Oh, goodness.</i>
<i>Carolyn Carmichael's gonna</i>
<i>have a fit</i>
<i>when she sees this, huh?</i>
Well, you ready
to go?
Mm-hmm.
<i>[ Maxine ]</i>
<i>Has Woody been there all day?</i>
<i>[ Browne ] Since this mornin'.</i>
<i>So you were ready</i>
<i>to come on home, Troy.</i>
<i>You had enough of the South.</i>
- I don't blame you one bit.
- Mm-hmm. It's too slow.
Y'all don't know
what y'all missin'
growin' up in the South.
I'm glad I missed it.
Troy, when was your birthday?
- Yesterday.
<i>- Oh. So how old</i>
<i>are you now? Eight?</i>
- Ten.
<i>- No! How's my brother clem,</i>
<i>aunt song and viola doin'?</i>
Good. Thanks for
the ticket. I didn't
get a chance to write.
You're very welcome.
That's what family's for.
Gotta stick together, right?
Right.
<i>Sure you're right.</i>
<i>[ Maxine ] Troy, we're</i>
<i>going to make a quick stop</i>
<i>before we take you home.</i>
[ Troy ] Who's sick?
[ Maxine ]
It's nothing serious, dear.
It's mommy, isn't it?
Well, it's just she hadn't
been feelin' too well lately.
What's wrong with her?
We don't know yet, Troy.
The doctors are running tests.
How come she didn't tell me?
How come nobody told me?
Because no one wanted you
to worry yourself silly,
and your mother
didn't think there was
any cause for alarm.
Where's daddy?
He's in there with your mother.
Hey! Miss
coomish mimmish!
Hi, daddy!
Hey, baby. Troy's back.
Hmm? Oh!
Oh, ladybug. Hi!
Hi.
Hmm?
Hi, mommy.
How you feelin'?
Who did that
to your hair?
Aunt song.
Aunt so... oh, shit,
I knew she would.
<i>[ Coughing ]</i>
Come on.
Give me a big hug.
I missed you.
So much!
I missed you too.
Even my brothers.
Gee, you must have
been lonesome
if you missed them.
Mommy, you work too hard.
I can start helpin' you.
I can cook and clean.
I don't even care if
nobody else helps me.
<i>Got to get</i>
<i>your rest.</i>
That's very kind of you.
Come here.
You know, I need you...
To watch out for Joseph,
your little brother.
<i>He's the youngest.</i>
<i>He's your responsibility.</i>
You promise me?
Come here.
[ Whispering ]
I promise.
Woody, go get the car.
I'm ready to go home.
<i>Okay.</i>
You're comin'
home now?
Mm-hmm.
Really?
<i>[ Woody ] Let's go, Troy.</i>
Get the car.
Okay.
Your car.
Aunt song kinda weird, huh?
Yeah.
They talk funny
down there.
What do you mean
they talk funny
down there?
[ Exaggerated
Southern accent ]
Oh, yeah.
Hey. Where'd
those trees come from?
Your mother. She got
the block association to put
some life on this street.
[ Honking horn ]
Hey! Clinton!
Wendell!
Looka here.
Don't she look good?
[ All ] Yeah!
[ Clinton ]
Look at that hair.
Hey, Tommy,
turn that junk off now.
<i>Oh, come on.</i>
Tired of you playin'
that garbage on my stoop.
<i>It's the chi-lites.</i>
Yeah, I know. Chi-nothin'.
<i>You want some help?</i>
<i>[ Buzzing noise ]</i>
Quit it.
Didn't expect to
see you here for at least
another two weeks.
Get off!
<i>- Hey, leave her alone.</i>
- Hey, Clinton, grab this bag.
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- Boy, you better
come get these bags.
She should carry her own bags.
<i>¶ They say</i>
<i>let the woman</i>
<i>take care of you ¶</i>
<i>¶ so I try to be hip ¶</i>
<i>¶ and think like the crowd ¶</i>
<i>¶ but even the crowd</i>
<i>can't help me now ¶</i>

Don't think you can come

Yeah, crabby.
Mommy ain't home.
What do you care?
Be quiet.
You be quiet.
The both of you can go
back down South.
<i>Soul train</i> on!

<i>My favourite part</i>
<i>of the show.</i>
<i>¶ Talk dirty, baby</i>

Somebody could get hurt.

<i>¶ Soul train ¶ ¶ soul train ¶</i>

about your mother.
<i>Everybody</i>
<i>listen to me</i>
<i>real good.</i>
The doctors told me
your mother's sicker
than we thought.
- What?
- They found...
- they found cancer.
- What's cancer?
It means that your mother's
gonna be in the hospital
for a while.
<i>There ain't</i>
<i>no need to be afraid.</i>
<i>Your mother's gonna be fine.</i>
<i>But she gonna have to</i>
<i>stay in there for a while.</i>
It's not fair.
I know it ain't fair,
but it's gonna be all right.
[ Children crying ]
Listen to me now.
All y'all, listen to me now.
Come on. Shh-shh!
Y'all ain't listenin'.
Come on. Now listen.
Shh-shh shh-shh!
What they got to do is run

[ Crying ]
Come on.
It's gonna be fine.
Come on. Don't be
like that, baby.
It wasn't my fault.
I know it wasn't
your fault, baby.
Ain't nobody's fault.
She gonna be out soon.
She just got to stay in there,
and they gonna run some tests.

- Hey, Sam, how come
you're not playin'?
- 'Cause I'm a girl, daddy.
<i>- [ TV dad ] Aw, come on.</i>
Troy.
Look. Here are
your new clothes.
Aren't they pretty?
Picked 'em out myself.
<i>[ Maxine ] Wait.</i>
Wait 'til you see these shoes.
Aren't they just adorable?
Troy, why don't you
at least try it on, okay?
<i>Please, ladybug.</i>
<i>Don't be difficult, okay?</i>
<i>I know this is hard for you.</i>
<i>It's hard for everybody.</i>
<i>But you have to wear</i>
<i>something nice.</i>
Don't you want to look
all pretty like aunt Maxine?
Carolyn would be
so proud of you.
Listen, my mother
hates polyester.
She would never let me
wear anything like that.
Right, Troy.
<i>- ¶ Get yourself go ¶</i>
- Get cheerios!
Troy?
<i>What?</i>
Let's go.
<i>I'm not goin'.</i>
Sh-sh-shit.
- Troy, baby, what
are you doin'?
- I'm sick.
Troy, you got everybody
waitin' on you.
<i>So?</i>
Miss coomish mimmish, please
don't make this any more
difficult than it has to be.
I hate funerals.
I'm not going.
Troy, you're not
the only one who's in pain.
<i>We're all hurtin'.</i>
<i>But we gotta think about</i>
<i>what would make mommy happy.</i>
You wanna make mommy
happy, don't you?
<i>Ain't no reason</i>
<i>tryin' right now.</i>
<i>Oh, yes, there is.</i>
<i>Your mother would want...</i>
Everybody to be
at the church...
<i>Together.</i>
<i>Will you do that</i>
<i>for me?</i>
Yeah.
I want you to get yourself
together. I'm gonna wait
for you downstairs, okay?
All right.
<i>I hate funerals too.</i>
I'll be downstairs.
Okay.

<i>who are these people,</i>

<i>of the woodwork.</i>
Mommy sure had
a lot of friends.
I guess she did.
Troy! They keep laughing
and pointing at me,
saying, "his mama's dead,
his mama's dead."
- And they took my money.
- Who?
The possoms!
Right hand and Snuffy!
Come on, Joseph.
There they are: The possums!
Who said it?
Who took your money?
Over there! Snuffy
and right hand man!
<i>[ Troy howling ]</i> Whoa!
<i>Snuffy, that's what you get.</i>
Troy, what you do that for?
We're tired
of being terrorized
by you and right hand.
Go sniff on your own block.
<i>¶ Ain't no sunshine</i>

<i>Come on, damn rat!</i>
<i>No! No!</i>
Daddy, stop!
Get out! Huh?
Mommy?
Mom... no.
Troy, mommy's gone.
Mommy is gone.
<i>¶ ain't no sunshine</i>
<i>when she's gone ¶</i>
<i>¶ and this house</i>

Troy, you can cry.
<i>¶ Anytime she goes away ¶</i>

Mommy's gone.

everybody was wonderin'
when you was gonna break.
<i>¶ anytime she goes away ¶</i>
even Clinton cried.
<i>¶ Anytime she goes away ¶</i>
daddy, please don't
make me move away.
I know aunt Maxine
wants me to go
and live with her.
Nobody's goin'
anywhere.
<i>¶ anytime she goes away ¶</i>
mommy was in
a lot of pain,
wasn't she?
Yes, she was.
Then it's good she died.
So she wouldn't have to suffer.
That's a nice way
of puttin' it, baby.
Yeah, that's real nice.
<i>¶ ...a rich man, we</i>
<i>can knock him off his feet ¶</i>

<i>baby, yeah ¶</i>
ow! You're hurting me!
Be quiet.
Doesn't hurt.
If you combed it
a little more often,
it wouldn't be lookin'
all like a sheep's behind.
But it never hurt
when mommy combed it.
I'm sorry, Joseph,
but I'm not mommy.
Ow.
<i>Dear ladybug: How are you?</i>
I miss you so very much.
I can't believe
you just turned ten!
All of you kids are
growing up so rapidly.
Ladybug, you turned out
pretty good considering you
were raised in a house...
Full of ashy,
rusty-butt boys.
Ow!
<i>Can Joseph come out and play?</i>
Troy, can he
come out?
All right.
Don't go too far.
Dinner's almost ready.
<i>Okay, I don't want</i>
