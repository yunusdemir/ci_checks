<i>Let's go, Toros</i>
<i>We are the Toros</i>
<i>The mighty, mighty Toros</i>
<i>We're so terrific</i>
<i>We must be Toros</i>
- Yeah!
- Go, Toros!
Yeah, come on! Yeah! All right!
Oh, my God!
- Nice rack!
- Huh?
Oh, baby!
Serves her right!
Check out the hooters!
Holy shit.
Hey, hey, Mr. and Mrs. S.
Oh, look, it's Aaron.
Oh! Hello, Aaron.
Hey, can I help?
Oh, no. We're fine, thanks.
Really. Stay in your vehicle.
You sure?
Bye! Be back later!
- Bye.
- Bye, honey.
Hi.
Come on, Tor.
Can't mack on you
in front of the parentals.
Bye-bye!
Remember, he's leaving for college.
Right.
So, are you excited?
Oh, yeah!
It's college, Tor. I'm
really stoked, you know?
It's just, you know,
I'm gonna miss you.
- Really?
- Yeah.
But next year, it'll
be you and me reunited
at Cal State Dominguez Hills.
I'll be the experienced sophomore,
you'll be the hot, new freshman.
Yup. It'll be just like
high school, only better.
Dorm rooms.
Hmm.
I got the door, Tor.
Okay.
I got the door, Tor.
All right.
- What's up, Aaron?
- Hey, what up, Grady?
- Hey!
- Yeah!
Hey, hey, remember, when you get
captain, act surprised, okay?
Don't jinx me.
Hi, Torrance.
Hey, Aaron.
Ah, ladies.
Good luck at school.
Thank you.
Oh, Aaron, come to
one last practice?
You know you're still my
favorite cheerleader.
- Aw!
- Please?
I'm sorry, guys. I gotta run.
You're not staying for the vote?
Hey, I really gotta beat traffic.
I can't be late for orientation.
- But I really want...
- Hey. Hey.
Mmm. Trust me. You're gonna get it.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Did you vote?
- Oh, yeah.
Darcy thinks she should get captain
'cause her dad pays for everything.
He should use some of that
money to buy her a clue.
Oh!
Courtney'll get captain.
The guys love clutching her butt.
Yeah, she's got
a lot to hang on to.
What's plural for "butt"?
On one person, I mean.
She puts the "ass" in "massive."
You put the "lude" in "deluded."
Yo! Can I have all your votes?
- Mine.
- Here's me.
Thank you.
We should get Big Red a gift, or at
least someone should say something.
- Pass.
- Good riddance.
I don't believe in osmosis.
It's not brown-nosing.
She's the departing captain.
She did a lot for this squad.
Oh, come on. Both of you sucked
before she whipped you into shape.
Oh, whipped? Is that what that was?
No one will miss Big Red, Tor.
She puts the "itch" in "bitch."
She puts the "whore"
in "horrifying."
You know, it's her last practice.
How would you feel?
Big Red has no feelings.
Just testicles.
You guys are all great athletes.
Thanks in large part to me.
And I know that your new captain
will keep the tradition alive.
Leading you to the
record sixth national
cheerleading championship,
you know is yours.
So, let's meet your new
leader, Torrance Shipman.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
That slut.
Okay, Listen up!
I'd like to try a Wolf Wall.
- Oh, excellent!
- Okay, yeah! We're all going to die.
Torrance has got the fever, people.
What's a Wolf's Wall?
Only the hardest pyramid known
to cheerleading and mankind.
The words "big" and
"britches" come to mind.
She's crazy. She'll kill us all.
Hello! Some of us have not spent
the entire summer working out.
Right, Carver?
Come on, guys!
Let's be different for once.
We can't just rest on our laurels.
Why does everybody say that?
Maybe a laurel's
a good place to rest.
Come on, man. You guys
suck. Let's do this.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Five, six, seven, eight! Kick one.
Carver!
Five, six, seven, eight!
And one! Stick it!
Come on, girls! Stick it for me!
Five, six, seven, eight!
Go one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Kick one!
Good job! Whoo!
Pinch some panties.
Someone's slacking.
Do I look like a milkmaid?
'Cause somebody feels like a cow!
Carver, can you cradle out?
You bet I can.
Okay, ready? One, two, down, up!
Carver!
Carver!
Are you okay?
I'm fine, really.
Don't you guys worry about me.
It's just a scratch.
I'll be back to practice tomorrow,
so don't you guys fret, okay?
And I don't want you to worry at
all, because I'm a quick healer.
I promise, you guys.
I'm gonna be there for you.
You hear me?
Guys?
Bye!
I got captain.
Yeah, and you sent a girl to the
hospital on your first day.
Aye, aye, Captain!
You were listening
on the phone? Mom!
It's true.
She really should get her
own private line, you know.
She's growing up so fast.
Justin, go away.
- At ease, Captain.
- Oh, shut up.
Well, this blistering academic
schedule shouldn't get in your way.
You should be happy about that.
Why can't you accept the
fact that I'm not a genius?
It just kills you that I'm
not an honor student.
No. It kills me that you
barely make time to study.
If you studied half as much as you
cheer, you'd be in great shape.
Your priorities are...
No! Those are your priorities!
Mine are just fine.
Look, I'm just saying that
college might be less of a shock
if you take an extra lab or
language course or something.
What do you think?
Will Advanced Chem
get you off my back?
Not completely, but it'll help.
Done.
You know, mothers have killed to
get their daughters on squads.
That mother didn't kill anyone.
She hired a hit man.
Hmm.
Everyone, we have a new student
transferring from Mission Hills
High School in Los Angeles.
Please welcome Cliff Pant-One.
Pantone.
Thanks.
Loser!
Loser!
Wait, wait, wait. Was that, uh...
Was that the "loser sneeze"
I just heard right there?
Guys, come on.
I mean, what is that,
from like the 1900s?
Nobody does that anymore.
I don't think anybody does.
When I lived in Kentucky...
Did they still do the
loser sneeze in Kentucky?
No. They had, uh,
guns and homemade bombs.
What about LA?
There was a lot of attitude
in LA, but no loser sneeze.
I'm pretty sure the loser
sneeze is officially dead.
Sorry.
Loser!
Nice.
I don't think they got the
memo about the loser sneeze.
Uh, no, apparently not.
Cliff.
Torrance.
Advanced Chem. Yikes.
Um, afraid so.
Are you intimidated?
Yeah, a little.
- Really?
- No, not really.
So, is that your band or something?
The Clash? No, uh...
It's a British punk band,
circa 1977 to 1983-ish.
Original lineup, anyway.
How vintage.
Um, so I'll see you around then?
Looks like it.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Whoa! It's sexy Leslie and Jan,
Jan, the cheerleading man.
Hey, fags.
Whoa, whoa. Just because we won
more trophies than you guys,
that's no reason
to go get all malignant.
Malignant this, tool.
- Nice.
- Oh, right on!
One of these days, man.
Let it go.
They never even won a single game.
It's gotta be kinda rough on them.
- Besides, they're dicks.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Les, tell me you have
Advanced Chem first period.
Advanced Chem, first period.
If you have a lab partner
already, I'm screwed.
Torrance, it's only
the second day of school,
and your academic insecurity
bit is completely tired.
You know, everyone's saying your
ambition broke Carver's leg.
When, really, it was the angle at
which she slammed into the ground.
Kasey did a massive e-mail last
night. Misspelled "leg."
Shut up!
Two G's.
Apparently, Carver gets home
schooling for the next three months.
I'm cursed.
Replacing her is gonna
be a nightmare.
Well, that's why you're
the captain, Captain.
Bring on the tyros, the
neophytes and the dilettanti.
SAT's are over, Darcy.
And you're still
jealous of my score.
Are we sure Carver's
not malingering?
Carver will strictly be cheering
in Special Olympics until March.
Nationals are February 10th.
Regionals are in, like, four weeks.
I talked to her.
She's cool with this.
Don't tell me Carver can cut school
just because she broke
her leg in three places.
Hello! Get a wheelchair!
That lucky bitch.
Tell me we're not actually
continuing this masquerade
and having tryouts.
Let's cut the crap
and pick somebody now.
Whitney's little sister
Jamie is really teeny.
She'll be easy to toss,
and she doesn't give lip.
Just tongue.
Oh, kiss my ass, Jan.
I'd love to.
If she's the best, Jamie's got it.
But we have to see everyone.
Ready, okay!
Wait. Hold on.
Let me try that again.
That was terrible.
Ready, okay!
Go, team...
Ready, okay!
Sorry.
Ready, okay!
Shit.
Be aggressive.
Be, be aggressive.
How many cheers do we
actually have to memorize?
Do we get paid for this?
Oh, and do I have to
provide my own uniform?
And I see you guys are wearing red.
Um, that just does not work for me.
Ready, okay!
R-C-H!
Toros all the way!
I'm sorry. I just broke
up with my boyfriend.
Pretty good.
<i>Yo, yo, yo! What's up? What's up?</i>
<i>It's time to get busy!</i>
<i>So let's kick this shit</i>
<i>And rock the CK
off your panties, yeah</i>
<i>Give my regards to Broadway</i>
<i>Remember me to Herald Square</i>
<i>Tell all the gang...</i>
Excuse me!
What's with the song?
Isn't this the audition
for <i>Pippin?</i>
No.
<i>Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise</i>
<i>Tastes so good
make a grown man cry</i>
<i>Sweet cherry pie, yeah</i>
<i>Whoo!</i>
Hi.
<i>Well, swinging on the front
porch Swinging on the lawn</i>
<i>Swinging where we want
'cause there ain't nobody home</i>
Okay, uh, any more questions?
I think we're good.
- Here's our girl.
- Mmm-hmm.
<i>Rancho Carne's not all talk</i>
<i>All we know is Toros rock</i>
<i>Shake your booties
Scream and shout</i>
<i>Toro players work it out</i>
Go, Toros!
And do I really have to wear
those little underwear things?
'Cause I don't like
wearing underwear.
Thanks!
Excuse me. Where'd you
park your Harley?
Get real.
Tattoos are strictly verboten.
Sorry.
I got bored during fourth period.
You need to fill one of these out.
Did it.
Missy, is it?
Okay, before we start, I'm afraid
we're gonna need to make sure
you can do a standing back tuck.
Standard procedure, you understand.
Standing back handspring
back tuck, okay?
Where's this girl from, Romania?
Can she yell?
We'll try an oldie.
<i>Awesome, oh, wow!
Like, totally freak me out!</i>
<i>- I mean, right on
- I mean, right on</i>
<i>The Toros sure are number one</i>
<i>I transferred from Los Angeles</i>
<i>Your school has no gymnastics team</i>
<i>This is a last resort</i>
Okay, so I've never
cheered before. So what?
How about something that
actually requires neurons?
Do it.
Front handspring,
step out, round off,
back handspring,
step out, round off,
back handspring,
full twisting lay out.
Hey!
Missy is bank.
Uh, bankrupt.
We've already so decided on Jamie.
Yeah.
Courtney, this is not a democracy.
It's a "cheerocracy."
I'm sorry, but I'm overruling you.
You are being a "cheertator,"
Torrance, and a pain in my ass!
We already voted.
Besides, Missy looks
like an uber dyke.
Courtney, I'm the captain.
I'm pulling rank, and you
can fall in line or not.
If we're gonna be the best,
we have to have the best.
Missy's the poo.
So take a big whiff.
You.
And you.
I mean, hi. I'm...
A cheerleader.
Uh, yeah. Head
cheerleader, to be exact.
Wow.
So, does Missy live here?
Uh, actually, she moved
back to LA, yeah.
Something about
evil cheerleaders or...
Look, I'm serious.
We have to get her.
Is her drug dependency
gonna be a problem?
Cliff, shut up. What do you want?
I want you on the squad.
You're the best. They know it.
They just reject the unfamiliar.
Thanks, but, no, thanks.
I mean, I plead temporary insanity.
See, I'm a hard-core gymnast.
No way jumping up and down, screaming,
"Go, team, go!" is gonna satisfy me.
Look, we're gymnasts, too, except
no beam, no bars, no vault.
Sorry. Not interested.
What are you doing?
Nothing, I just thought
that it was interesting
hearing Torrance's point of view.
How do you even know her?
We're old friends.
Ever been to a
cheerleading competition?
Oh, you mean like a football game?
No, not a game.
Those are like practices for us.
I'm talking about a tournament.
ESPN cameras all around,
hundreds of people
in the crowds cheering.
Wait, people cheering cheerleaders?
That's right. Lots of people.
Here's the deal, Missy.
We're the shit. The best.
We have fun, we work hard,
and we win national championships.
I'm offering you a chance
to be a part of that.
Think about it, Miss. I mean,
you get to wear sassy outfits.
You get to yell like you
care about something.
She's not the cheering type.
You know what?
Count me in.
Ready, girls?
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>
<i>I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere</i>
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>
Here we go, girls.
Hey, practice isn't over yet.
Nice recruit, Torrance.
A real captain would've seen
what I saw, a big dykey loser.
I'd say that's strike two.
What the hell is up?
I went out on a limb for
you, and you just bail?
I'm not about stealing.
What are you talking about?
You ripped off those cheers.
Listen, Missy, our cheers
are 100% original.
Count the trophies.
Well, your trophies are bullshit,
because you're a sad-ass liar.
All right, that's it!
Get out of the car!
I'm gonna kick your ass!
Oh, really?
Come on.
You're in for a rude
awakening. Get in.
What? No way.
For real. Get in.
Do your thing, Isis!
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>
<i>I said brrr
It's cold in here</i>
<i>There must be some
Clovers in the atmosphere</i>
<i>I said oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>
<i>Slow it down</i>
<i>Oh-ee, oh-ee, oh
Ice, ice, ice</i>
Here we go
Hey!
You guys enjoy the show?
Yes, were the ethnic festivities
to your liking today?
You guys are awesome.
Really? You're ready
to share those trophies?
Can we just beat these buffys
down so I can go home?
I'm on curfew, girl.
Look, there's no need for that.
Oh, you know what? She's right.
See, then we'd be
doing them a favor.
See, then they could feel good
about sending Raggedy Ann up here
to jack us for our cheers.
Raggedy Ann?
Ugly redhead with a video camera
permanently attached to her hand.
Y'all have been coming up here for
years, trying to steal our routines.
And we just love
seeing them on ESPN.
What are you talking about?
"Brrr, it's cold in here.
"I said there must be some
Toros in the atmosphere?"
I know you didn't think a
white girl made that shit up.
I...
Our free cheer service
is over as of this moment.
- Over!
<i>- Finito!</i>
God, it's like, every time we get some,
here y'all come, trying to steal it,
putting blonde hair on it and
calling it something different.
We've had the best squad
around for years,
but no one's been able
to see what we can do.
Oh, but you better believe all
that's gonna change this year.
I'm captain, and I guarantee you
we'll make it to Nationals.
So, just hand over the tape you made
tonight and we'll call it even for now.
We don't have any tape.
Really. We just came
to see the show.
What? Come on, Isis.
Let me do this.
You know what? Let's go.
Wait a minute. So that's it?
We're just gonna let them go?
Yeah, because unlike
them, we have class.
I swear I had no idea.
Well, now you do.
You been touched by an angel, girl.
Jenelope, let's go.
I can't believe those white
girls just came up here...
We just so almost got our
asses kicked back there!
I mean, I knew I'd seen
those routines before.
We used to play East
Compton all the time.
You really had no idea, did you?
Do you know what this means?
My entire cheerleading
career has been a lie.
Well, look on the bright side.
It's only cheerleading.
I am only cheerleading.
Do you believe in curses?
What are you talking about?
I think I'm cursed.
And why is that?
This past summer at cheer camp,
all the new seniors
had to do a dare.
See, there's this thing
called the spirit stick,
and it can never,
ever touch the ground.
Torrance Shipman, your mission,
should you choose to
accept it, and you better,
is to capture the spirit stick
and drop it in front
of the entire camp.
Y'all are such
an inspiration to us.
Well, I just wanted
to congratulate you guys
and take a picture of you
with the spirit stick.
Here.
Here.
I don't want it now.
No, it's okay. The spirit
stick doesn't lose anything.
The person who drops it, however,
goes to Hades!
I don't mean to laugh, but
cheerleading urban legends?
You're not jinxed. Shit happens.
Hey, I have to tell you something.
I'm on the phone, creep.
I realize that, and normally
I'd be listening on the other
line, but this is important.
Okay, what?
Oh! Get out!
Thank you for listening.
Yo.
- Is Aaron around?
<i>- Back later.</i>
- Do you know when?
<i>- No.</i>
Have him call Torrance.
It's urgent.
<i>All right.</i>
Big Red totally screwed us!
I mean monster screwed us!
I put this to the entire squad.
Swear you guys didn't know?
Big Red didn't exactly let any of us
help with the routines, Torrance.
I cannot believe she did this.
I feel awful. It's depraved.
I mean, those East Compton girls
wanted to grill our asses.
Big Red ran the show, man.
I mean, we were just flying
ignorami, for sobbing out loud.
We can't go to Regionals
with a stolen routine.
It's too risky.
Changing the routine now would
be total murder-suicide.
Seriously.
Let's not put the "duh" in "dumb."
How are East Compton
gonna prove anything?
You people are unbelievable.
I mean, we're talking
about cheating here.
Sorry, new girl,
but nobody hit your buzzer.
Look, I hate to be predictable,
but I don't give a shit.
We learned that routine
fair and square.
We logged the man-hours.
Don't punish the squad
for Big Red's mistake.
This isn't about cheating.
This is about winning.
Everyone in favor of winning?
I get what you're saying,
Missy, but there's no time.
If we don't do the routine,
we've got nothing else.
So, you in?
Whatever.
Get out of here!
Hey, this is the living room.
It's public domain.
<i>Yo.</i>
Hey, may I please speak
to Aaron? It's Torrance.
<i>He's not here. He's, uh...
He's not here. Bye.</i>
I'll take Famous Losers
for 200, Alex.
Shut up, moron!
It's not my fault you're in love
with a big gay cheerleader who
won't return your phone calls.
Aaron is not gay.
Oh, so someone just made
him become a cheerleader?
He's just busy!
Yeah, busy scamming on guys.
Give me that!
Bitch!
Where is she?
Come on.
- Oh, baby!
- Oh!
Whoo!
No way.
Sexy mama!
Whoo! Take it off!
Whoo!
Come on. Go, sexy.
Whoo! You're on fire, yeah!
You sure I can stay over
at your house tonight?
Totally fine. My parents
are at some benefit.
They'll be pouring themselves
into bed around dawn.
Good. We gotta start early.
You'll be a star cheerleader yet.
You know, all the
cheerleaders in the world
wouldn't help our football team.
Man, it's just wrong.
Cheering for them
is just plain mean.
Everybody comes to
see you ladies, anyway.
Because we're such fine athletes.
Oh, live with it.
You'll be fighting off major oglers
while we defend our sexuality.
What is your sexuality?
Well, Jan's straight,
while I'm controversial.
Are you trying to tell
me you speak fag?
Oh, fluently.
And Courtney and
Whitney, dyke-adelic?
- No!
- Are you kidding?
I don't think so.
See, Courtney doesn't wear
anything under her spankies.
That's no excuse, Jan.
I can't help it if my
digits slip occasionally.
Nuh-uh. Slip? Where?
Oh, come on, Missy.
Don't make him say it.
Oh, my God.
My God, too.
You're a sick man, Jan.
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>put your hands together
for the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>
<i>And now, without further
ado let's hear it</i>
<i>for the five-time National
Cheerleading Champions,</i>
<i>the mighty Toros!</i>
Go! Go! Come on!
We're number one!
Come on! Let's hear it!
Whoo! Yeah!
Bring it on, baby!
Come on! Let's hear it! Come on!
Go, Toros!
Come on, Toros! Whoo!
Go, Toros!
Come on, Toros!
Come on. Yeah!
Yeah, Toros! Yeah!
Whoo!
Come on, guys, let's do it!
Ready?
<i>Yo-ho, go, everybody!</i>
Why don't you let your
cheerleaders play for you?
At least they win shit occasionally.
Oh, man, is that the best you got?
Yeah, come on, bring
it on, butt plug.
You want more? Okay.
While we're out here
kicking your ass,
- your cheer boys are over there...
- Ooh.
scamming on all your squirrel.
Which is cool, since you
don't have dicks anyway.
Mmm-hmm.
Bitch! Punk!
<i>Hey, Toros
That's right</i>
<i>The red, black and white</i>
<i>Guess what? Guess what?</i>
<i>You really suck</i>
<i>Hey, that's all right, that's okay</i>
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>
<i>That's all right That's okay</i>
<i>You're gonna pump our gas someday</i>
Come on, guys! Touchdown!
Let's go, yeah!
Oh!
Nice.
<i>Fourteen-nothing.</i>
- Go!
- Hut!
<i>And with 4:50 left in
the third quarter...</i>
Losers.
<i>It's Costa Mesa 34, Toros nothing.</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Work!
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Work!
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Work!
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Work!
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Work!
<i>Knock them down roll them around</i>
<i>Come on, Defense, work!</i>
Oh!
Ooh!
Jan!
Go, Toros!
Yeah!
Come on, Toros!
You're, like,
totally his eye candy.
God, I can't believe
you'd do that to Aaron.
Do what?
Especially with him.
What are you talking about?
Oh, don't play dumb. We're
better at it than you.
You're having cheer sex with him.
<i>Flag on the play, it's
called against...</i>
<i>You guessed it, the Toros.</i>
<i>Remember, our next defeat is scheduled
for next Friday night at 8:00.</i>
Let's go, Toros!
Let's go, Toros!
Let's go, Toros!
Let's go, Toros!
All right!
We're sweet, we got the
whip We can't be beat
<i>We're the best
Our team's too cool</i>
<i>We got the class
to rock this school</i>
<i>Ah, yeah</i>
<i>We bad, we got the
team, we can't be had</i>
<i>We're the best
So score them points</i>
<i>You win the game
We'll rock this joint</i>
<i>Go, Toros, go, Toros
Go, go, go, Toros</i>
<i>Go, Clovers, go, Clovers
Go, go, go, Clovers</i>
<i>Our game is fierce and we are hip</i>
<i>So get on back
You can't touch this</i>
<i>Our game is bad
We're without peer</i>
<i>So get that weakness outta here</i>
<i>Tried to steal our bit
but you look like shit</i>
<i>But we're the ones
who are down with it</i>
I still say we use
the routine we have.
If we have to start over, I quit.
<i>And that's the game.</i>
Whoever here is for a new
routine, raise your hand.
<i>Final score. Cougars
42, Toros nothing.</i>
<i>Jan's got spirit, yes, he do</i>
<i>Jan's got spirit, how about you?</i>
Dude, you just lost.
So, is every game that eventful?
No. Thank God.
We have a real situation
on our hands.
I mean, we were humiliated
on our own turf.
We might have to have a rumble.
This is a serious problem!
Oh, so is your breath.
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.
What are you doing?
Um...
Where's the bathroom?
Right there.
Oh!
Good night.
Night.
Are you into my brother?
No. I have a boyfriend.
Hello.
<i>Aaron?</i>
Tor, is that you?
Where have you been?
I keep trying to call you.
Yeah, I know. I've been, like,
totally busy with school
and practice and stuff. What's up?
Oh, it's bad, Aaron.
Miss Red snaked our routines
from the East Compton Clovers.
- All of our routines.
- What?
And they found out about it.
They showed up at the game.
Gauntlets were thrown.
Tell me you didn't know about this.
I mean, I don't know what to do here.
Of course, I didn't know,
but you gotta calm down.
<i>This is not that big a deal.</i>
<i>Everybody uses
everybody else's material.</i>
It's like this unwritten
rule or something.
That doesn't help me.
We can't do their
routine at Regionals
because they're gonna do
their routine at Regionals.
Come on, Tor,
you need a new routine.
That's all. No problem.
Just hire a professional
choreographer.
A choreographer?
<i>Look, just think of it
as collaboration.</i>
<i>The UCA totally
looks the other way.</i>
Call this guy.
His name is Sparky Polastri.
<i>- Pen.
- Remember Nationals last year?</i>
Knows his shit, all right?
Here's the number. It's 555-7219.
Thanks, Aaron. You
always know what to do.
Mmm-hmm. Bye, baby.
Mmm, who was that?
My sister. Mmm.
But you're not my sister, are you?
He says we should hire
a choreographer.
<i>Hello.</i>
Hi. May I please speak
to Sparky Polastri?
He'll need three or four days
to teach us the routine.
But here's the thing.
It's gonna cost us $2,000.
What, do I have the letters
A-T-M tattooed on my forehead?
We were thinking more
like D-A-D-D-Y.
Maybe I can get 500.
Okay, then we only need
1500 more by Monday.
What's up, Whitney?
Hi.
Here we are at the Rancho
Carne Toro car wash,
raising a little money.
<i>Yeah, baby, yeah!</i>
<i>Work it, Kasey!</i>
<i>What's up, buddy?</i>
<i>Come to mama.</i>
<i>Soak it up.</i>
<i>Working hard for our money?</i>
<i>That's a good shot, Les.</i>
You're right.
<i>Giving it a little
buff job. That's good.</i>
<i>Oh, that's attractive, Tor.</i>
<i>Looking good. Shaking the booty.</i>
<i>Missy, what the hell are you doing?</i>
<i>Watch it!</i>
<i>Dude, watch out for the camera.</i>
Hey, perv.
Hand over your 15 bucks
or get out of here.
What are you doing?
Making money from guys
ogling my goodies.
Aw, I didn't need
to hear that. I didn't.
That was an over-share.
Hey, Torrance. Come here a sec.
We'll just get this over with.
My brother wants to
check out your rack.
You know, I begged my
mom for a brother.
He'd look a little ridiculous
in that bikini, wouldn't he?
Yeah.
So, nice car.
Yeah. Um...
What can I say? I drive hard.
Shouldn't take long to wash.
Oh, don't even worry about it.
I got all afternoon.
I'll bet you do.
Where the hell is this guy?
Listen, we're lucky he's
even doing this for us.
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>
<i>Y'all ready for this?</i>
Great.
- Thanks for coming. We're...
- Don't speak.
You. You have weak ankles.
One of your calves
is bigger than the other.
Too much makeup.
Not enough makeup.
What's with the skin?
Say it with me, "Sunlight"!
Male cheerleaders. Enough said.
Smile.
Don't smile.
Jackass.
Good general tone and musculature.
Report those compliments
to your ass
before it gets so big
it forms its own Web site.
And you, I take you
to be the captain,
which means you'll probably
need more work than anyone.
- Look, you don't...
- Shh...
- But...
- No, no, no, no, no.
Don't speak. Don't think.
Listen and learn.
I'm a choreographer.
That's what I do.
You are cheerleaders.
Cheerleaders are dancers
who have gone retarded.
What you do is a tiny,
pathetic subset of dancing.
I will attempt to transform your
robotic routines into poetry,
written with the human body.
Follow me or perish,
sweater monkeys.
I want you to think of what
you ate today. Got it?
Now cut that in half. This is called
a diet. Everyone start one today.
Darcy, honey,
you should stop eating.
You see, when you skip a meal, your
body feeds off its fat stores.
And if you skip enough, maybe
your body will eat your ass.
Why does everyone
have to go on a diet?
Because in cheerleading,
we throw people in the air,
and fat people don't go as high.
Come on, come on.
Let's get back to work!
Hold her up! I want dangerous!
I wanna feel like somebody's
gonna snap their neck!
Spirit fingers!
Give me spirit fingers!
Spirit fingers. Give me spirit!
Ouch! Ouch!
What? I told you I'd catch you.
Look, I understand you have
underwear up your ass right now,
but it beats the hell
out of a shattered skull.
Think about it.
Okay, now, spirit fingers.
Spirit fingers!
And spirit fingers!
Oh, my God!
These are not spirit fingers.
These are spirit fingers.
And these are gold.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
Screw this.
I did not sign on
for spirit fingers.
Come on! The spirit
fingers are great!
Yeah, whatever.
We are so screwed.
- Hey.
- Hey.
What's the matter?
You don't wanna know.
Ah! Cheer crisis.
I've just gotten so bogged
down in all this crap.
Well, if it's crap,
why do you do it?
I don't know.
So quit.
Maybe I should.
Yeah, I mean, if you
don't like it anymore.
I didn't say that.
Sounds like it.
I don't know what I want.
I remember back when I cheered
at my school in Detroit.
You cheered at your
other high school?
No, I never cheered, but I know
what you're going through.
And regardless of all the
politics and the doubts,
and the crap,
you just have to know
that you can do it.
And if it helps,
I know you can.
You do?
Yeah.
All right, all right! I'm ready
to make a fool of myself.
State regionals, here we come.
So much better than last year.
Welcome to the world of
competitive cheerleading.
High school divisions,
please check the signs.
If you're not here,
your division will be...
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven...
Broncos!
Ready? Okay!
Some of these uniforms
look so skanky.
Whatever. They're white trash.
- Where do they get them?
- They're white trash.
Cutter, I'm gonna kick
your ass, you evil whore!
Get over it, hag!
She did not just hit me!
No, she's a little kid.
You little...
Get off me!
- Leave me alone!
- Stop it, Courtney!
Hi. You, yes.
Your head was down.
Your head was down
during that move.
How are you gonna give a proper
score if you're not looking,
if your head is down during a move?
Remember, they give extra points
for alacrity and effulgence.
Did we bring those?
Oh, no. Look who's here.
Hi.
We're in trouble.
<i>And now, making their
first appearance</i>
<i>at the UCA California Regionals,
the East Compton Clovers!</i>
Yeah, Clovers!
Stop.
<i>I'm standing here with five-time
national returning champions,</i>
the Rancho Carne Toros.
Leading the squad this year
is senior Torrance Shipman.
<i>Torrance, one of the things
we've come to expect</i>
<i>from the Toros over the last few
years is a highly original routine.</i>
<i>Can we expect the same this year?</i>
<i>Well, I think everyone goes
out there the same way,</i>
<i>being as prepared as they can be
and just hoping for the best.</i>
<i>We're just glad to be back here,</i>
<i>and eager to see what some of the
other squads have come up with.</i>
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>
<i>Isn't that Sparky?</i>
<i>Well, thank you, Rancho
Carne Toros, and good luck.</i>
<i>- And now, the Mighty Muskrats...</i>
- Thanks.
<i>of Mesa Cucamonga!</i>
Spirit fingers.
They stole our routine!
Keep that Trojan spirit up!
Pump! Pump! Pump it up!
- It's the curse.
- What?
The spirit stick curse.
Oh, God, will you
lay off with that?
There's no curse, and
you're not going to Hades.
News flash! Look around.
We are in Hades!
Rancho Carne! You're up next!
<i>And now, from San
Diego, California,</i>
<i>the five-time
national champions,</i>
<i>the Rancho Carne Toros!</i>
Yeah! Yeah!
I bet this is good.
<i>Prepare for total domination!</i>
Didn't we just see this routine?
What the f...?
<i>The Rancho Carne Toros,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>
Go, Toros!
Think they screwed up.
That was, um, interesting.
Y'all should've just
stuck with our routines.
Yeah.
Don't worry. We'll send you
a postcard from Nationals.
<i>Next up, the Fighting
Beavers of San Bernardino.</i>
- Torrance Shipman?
- Yes.
Tad Freeman, Universal
Cheer Association.
We have a problem.
A problem?
Oh, yes, a very big problem.
Hey.
I don't know if you can imagine...
- Hey. - ...The incredible sense
of <i>déja vu</i> I experienced
as I was watching
that last routine.
I wouldn't just now.
- What?
- Official cheer business.
Come on. It's me. Hey, Torrance!
You see, I...
Not now.
That was smooth. Real smooth.
I'll see her later.
All righty.
Oh, uh, by the way,
nice spirit fingers.
Yeah. Well, here's another.
Thanks.
Obviously your Toros aren't the only
squad with this particular routine.
Does the name Sparky Polastri
mean anything to you?
- Sparky Polastri?
- Mmm-hmm.
Apparently he's been peddling this same
routine up and down the California coast.
Six squads total.
We're holding an emergency session
of the discretionary panel.
About what?
We've never had a situation
like this before.
We really should
disqualify you and...
No, no, don't punish the squad.
It was my choice to hire
Sparky, not theirs.
Don't penalize everyone
for my bad judgment.
But since there's
no precedent for this,
there's nothing in the rule
books that forbids it.
It's simply frowned upon.
And I suppose we can't disqualify
you on those grounds alone.
As defending champions, you are
guaranteed a bid to Florida,
but know that
we'll be watching you.
And don't expect to show up
at finals with that routine.
What are you doing? You're
wrecking everything I built!
Hey, hey, hey, it's not totally her fault.
I was the one that hooked up...
This season should have
been gravy, okay?
I handpicked the squad, I
delivered an idiot-proof routine.
Platter, Nationals, hello!
Don't you mean a stolen routine?
Don't be so naive, Torrance.
Look, the truth is I was
a real leader, okay?
I did what I had to do
to win at Nationals,
and ever since I handed
the reins over to you,
you've run my squad
straight into the ground!
If I made any mistake
as a squad leader,
it wasn't borrowing cheers,
it was announcing you
as my successor.
Uh-uh. Not cool.
Hey, Tor. Tor. Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Let me go. I just wanna
get out of here.
Hey, Big Red's a bitch.
We all know that.
Even she knows that.
I don't know what
to do here, Aaron.
Look. I know I haven't
always been there for you,
since I went to college.
It's been a rough
transition, for both of us.
But I still care about you as much
as I ever did. You know that, right?
- You do?
- Of course.
Which is why I hate to see you
like this, all stressed out.
It's not good for you.
You're a great cheerleader,
Tor, and you're cute as hell.
It's just that maybe...
Maybe.
You're just not captain material,
and there's nothing
wrong with that.
Maybe you should consider letting
Courtney and Whitney take over the squad.
They're just like Big Red.
You want me to give up captain?
Hey, let them deal
with the politics.
You just do what you do best, Tor.
You cheer.
Cheer, Tor. Okay?
I just wanna see you happy.
Bye.
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Friend of yours?
He's my boyfriend.
Look, Cliff, I can explain.
No. It's cool.
Here, um, I made you a tape, too.
Cliff...
<i>Hey, Torrance, uh, it's me, Cliff.</i>
Um, here's...
<i>I wrote something for
you, so here it is.</i>
Oh, Torrance
<i>Can't stand your cheerleading squad</i>
<i>But I love your pom-poms</i>
<i>I'd feed you bonbons all night</i>
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>
<i>Yeah, you got me to feel
all those butterflies inside</i>
<i>In your locker I would hide</i>
<i>The truth,
It's only you I see</i>
<i>And you're just what I need</i>
<i>I'd bring you flowers everyday</i>
<i>Just to roll you in the hay</i>
<i>Well, I'm feeling fine
I'm right on time</i>
<i>I know I'll get my way</i>
<i>And you're just what I need</i>
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>
<i>'Cause you're just what I need</i>
<i>And you're just what I need</i>
<i>Not everything works as it seems</i>
<i>Is that so hard to believe?</i>
<i>Shout out</i>
Aaron called us last night.
He told us you're turning
the squad over to us.
We want you know that just because
you bit the big one as captain,
does not mean we're gonna
be super hard on you.
- Oh!
- We'll treat you as if
you didn't screw us
into the ground.
Gee, thanks.
Everyone, Torrance
is not to be harmed.
We've already decided
on a course of action.
We're gonna forego
Nationals this year.
Everyone's already agreed to it.
- Uh, except me.
- And me!
Both of you can be replaced.
I can't believe you guys.
The only person who can officially resign
the post of captain is the captain,
and I'm not going anywhere.
Then we'll have to overthrow you.
Which we will!
Enough!
Our whole cheering career, we've staked
our reputation on being the best,
the most inventive.
Now we finally have a chance
to truly be original,
and you're all running scared.
She's crazy.
I am not crazy,
and I'm not resigning
as captain either.
You're gonna have to kill me first.
That can be arranged.
Shut it, Whitney! Let her talk!
Look, I know I've screwed
up royally as captain,
but I believe in this squad,
and I know we can
bounce back from this.
I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be hard work.
We need a new routine,
something amazing and fresh,
and we've got less than
three weeks till Nationals.
But if we can do it,
if we can pull this off,
then we can really
call ourselves original.
Now who's with me?
How about it, girls?
It's gonna be hard without you two.
Fine.
Sure. Whatever.
Okay. Let's do this.
<i>We're gonna devote every
waking hour to practice,</i>
<i>before school, in between
classes and after school.</i>
<i>Afternoon practices will
have to be twice as long.</i>
<i>We've gotta do whatever it takes
to be in perfect physical shape.</i>
Yeah. You can go a little harder.
There, there.
Yeah, that feels good.
Maybe we should join the squad.
- Push.
- Oh, yeah.
Fag!
<i>And since the football team sucks
no matter how hard we cheer,</i>
<i>we'll use night games
to practice, too.</i>
<i>But that's not all.</i>
<i>We're gonna study
other types of movement,</i>
<i>from swing dance,</i>
<i>to interpretive dance...</i>
And you flow and you...
<i>even mime.</i>
<i>We'll draw inspiration from martial
arts, musicals, everything.</i>
<i>You guys know
we've got the talent.</i>
<i>We've just gotta work our asses
off and trust our instincts.</i>
<i>All of our instincts.</i>
Tor!
Wow! What are you doing here?
Just wanted to come by and see you.
Is this a bad time?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm super busy. I'm
working on this project...
Yeah, you sound super busy.
I guess that's it.
You were too busy to believe in me.
Oh, no, no, but wait.
You weren't too busy to sell me out
to Courtney and Whitney, were you?
Gee, now I'm confused.
Well, I hope you're not
too busy to hear this.
Kiss my ass, Aaron! It's over!
You're a great cheerleader, Aaron.
It's just that...
Maybe you're not exactly
boyfriend material.
Bye-bye.
You're a cheerleader?
UCA just posted the Nationals
list on the Internet.
East Compton isn't on it.
They couldn't raise the money
in time. They're not going.
What do you mean,
"They're not going"?
Torrance, that's good news.
They cannot not go.
That's not good news.
What are you talking about?
They don't go, we win.
Once again we're the best.
I define best as competing against the
best there is out there and beating them.
They have to go.
It's so unfair.
The first inter-city squad
to get a bid to Nationals
and they can't afford to go?
Look, Mom. Her head is spinning
off into another dimension.
Justin!
The company gets hit up for
money all the time, honey.
I just can't.
It's not that much money,
Mr. Level-Playing-Field.
Tell them the deal.
Maybe they'll wanna help.
Yeah? Okay, I'll make the call,
but I'll tell you,
they'll probably say no.
Don't let them.
Think of how much it'll
mean to East Compton.
They deserve to go.
Do the right thing, Dad!
Did that just happen?
Yeah.
"Where we come from, cheer is
not a word we hear very often."
"They should call us
inspiration leaders instead."
Oh, that's deep. I like that.
I don't know why we writing
to some talk-show host.
It's like we begging
for charity or something.
It's not charity. Pauletta
Patton's from our neighborhood.
She'll understand
why we need the money.
Tell her we need to buy donuts.
Her big butt will understand that.
Ha-ha! Stop being
counterproductive, all right?
Lava, please stop teaching her these
big words before she choke on one.
No, better I choke you, Lafred.
- Look, Jenelope...
- You guys, stop!
Please. Damn!
Well, tell her about the late-night
practices we've been having.
There you go. That's the kind of
stuff she wants to hear about.
Now we're talking.
You guys have to go to Nationals.
Did you come up here
just to tell me that?
Here. I got my dad's company
to sponsor you guys.
What is this, hush money?
No.
Oh, right. It's guilt money.
You pay our way in and you
sleep better at night
knowing how your whole world is
based on one big, old fat lie.
Well, you know what?
We don't need you.
Why do you have to be so mean?
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.
Look, I'm trying to be
strong for my squad, okay?
That's what a captain does.
Well, I'm a captain, too, you know,
and I'm trying to make it right.
You wanna make it right?
Then when you go
to Nationals, bring it.
Don't slack off because
you feel sorry for us.
That way, when we beat you,
we'll know it's
because we're better.
I'll bring it. Don't worry.
I never do.
Yeah, your parents
just have to sign it.
Okay, bye.
Bye, Tor.
I listened to your tape.
I loved it.
Great.
Can I talk to you?
I was upset that night.
Aaron gave me a ride home.
It was just a good-night
kiss. It meant nothing.
Oh. I'm sorry.
And I wanted you to know
that I broke up with him.
Congratulations.
He didn't believe in me.
You did!
Whatever.
That's important to me!
You believed in me!
Bite me.
Hanging out with the air heads has really
sharpened your verbal skills, huh?
Screw you.
Said the cheerleader.
That's right, I am a cheerleader,
and you're a dumb ass.
Torrance likes you, okay?
She likes you.
She has an odd way of showing it.
Don't be stupid.
She broke up with
her boyfriend for you.
Yeah.
Look. Do us all a favor and get over
yourself and tell her how you feel.
I thought I had.
Well, try again.
And let me give you a little
tip from a cheerleader.
Be aggressive.
<i>Now back to Paulette!</i>
Thank you. Thank you.
Today on Pauletta, it's "Wish Day"!
<i>Today's letter comes from
East Compton, California.</i>
"Dear Pauletta,
"Where we come from, cheer is not
a word that you hear very often,
"but that's what we are,
"the cheerleaders of
East Compton High School.
"They should really call us
inspiration leaders,
"because that's what we do.
"We inspire the people
from our neighborhoods
"to believe that our team can win.
<i>"That's why we're asking you
to fulfill our wish</i>
"to send us to the National
Cheerleading Competition
"for the first time."
Well, Clovers, you got your wish.
Audience, the East Compton Clovers!
<i>Hi, Pauletta.</i>
<i>We just wanna say how thankful
we are for all of your help.</i>
<i>Pauletta, you my girl!
You the bomb, baby!</i>
<i>Ooh, Pauletta, girl,
we love you so much, girl.</i>
<i>I want to say you don't
have to lose a pound.</i>
<i>We love you just the way you are!</i>
<i>Pauletta, we're gonna make you
an honorary Clover for life.</i>
<i>Thank you so much.</i>
Ooh! I'm gonna look
good in this, y'all.
So, is your family coming?
I don't know if Cliff's coming.
I totally blew it with Cliff.
Forget it. My brother's an idiot.
You're his sister. You
don't see him like I do.
Yeah, and that's a good thing,
'cause that would be a crime.
Hey, ladies, wanna
see my spirit stick?
<i>Hey, this is Cliff. Leave
a message after the...</i>
Hello. Hello?
<i>Lock your doors. Bolt your windows.</i>
<i>Daytona, Florida, has been
invaded by teenage cheerleaders.</i>
<i>And what do they want?</i>
<i>The chance to be the number one
cheerleading squad in the country.</i>
<i>You know, in high school, I couldn't
pay a cheerleader to talk to me.</i>
<i>Now, I'm surrounded by them,
and let's face it,</i>
<i>any sport that combines gymnastics,
dance and short skirts is okay by me.</i>
<i>ESPN2 welcomes you
to sunny Daytona, Florida,</i>
<i>for the Universal Cheer
Association Nationals 2000.</i>
<i>Fifty squads from 50 high
schools across the nation</i>
<i>are gathered here to duke it out.</i>
<i>You wanna talk pressure? Ha-ha.
These kids are feeling it.</i>
<i>One individual mistake
can cost a squad everything.</i>
<i>Who's got spirit? We do,
baby. Only on the deuce.</i>
Hey.
Watch going out of bounds. They
deduct like crazy for that stuff.
What, you going for
sainthood or something?
You don't wanna blow it
on something tiny.
Look, me and my squad made it to the
big show without any of your help.
I think we can handle it.
Stay in bounds!
If any of you step outside that
ugly blue carpet, you are dead.
Happy?
Yes.
Tell your girl on the end she's about
a half second early on all her moves.
Okay, I will. Happy?
Yep.
Hey, remember.
Bring it.
And what the hell was that about?
It's boom, boom...
We just understand
each other, that's all.
All right, let's do this.
- One, two, three.
- Clovers!
<i>The field has been narrowed,
and the advancing squads</i>
<i>will move on to tomorrow's finals.</i>
<i>Defending champs, the Toros,</i>
<i>have managed to come back from a
humiliating showing at Regionals.</i>
<i>But the real Cinderella
story here, of course,</i>
<i>is the Clovers of East
Compton, California.</i>
Kasey's popping zits again.
Gross, Kasey. You're totally
bedaubing the mirror.
Clean it off.
Okay, okay! All right.
I don't know what's scarier, neurotic
cheerleaders or the pressure to win.
I could make a killing selling
something like Diet Prozac.
Thank God you're here
this season, Missy.
I couldn't have done it alone.
Oh! Tear.
No, I mean it!
Shut up! You don't have
it yet, you don't have it!
Give it up already!
<i>Daytona, Florida, day number two.</i>
<i>By sundown, only one squad</i>
<i>can call themselves UCA
National Champions 2000.</i>
Shit!

Hey, babe. Are you

You wouldn't.
Oh, I would.

about the stakes, okay?
I'm totally cool. I'm so ready.

Yo, relax, girl. You're
making me even more nervous.
