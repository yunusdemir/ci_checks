Starling!
Starling!
Crawford wants to see you in his office.
Thank you, sir.
-Clarice.
-Hey.
...so there shouldn't be any problem
if you could...
-You looking for Crawford?
-Yes, sir.
He should be back in a couple minutes.
Why don't you wait in his office?
-Okay.
-And I think they were over in Flushing...
Starling,
Clarice M. Good morning.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
Sorry to pull you off of the course
at such short notice.
Your instructors tell me you're doing well.
-Top quarter of your class.
-I hope so.
They haven't posted any grades yet.
A job's come up, and I thought about you.
Not a job, really.
More of an interesting errand.
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
I remember you from my seminar at UVA.
You grilled me pretty hard, as I recall,
on the Bureau's civil rights record
in the Hoover years.
I gave you an "A."
A-minus, sir.
Let's see. Double major,
psych and criminology. Graduated magna.
Summer internships
at the Reitzinger Clinic.
It says here when you graduate,
you want to come to work for me
in Behavioral Science.
Yes, very much, sir. Very much.
We're interviewing all the serial killers
now in custody
for a psycho-behavioral profile.
It could be a real help in unsolved cases.
Most of them have been
happy to talk to us.
Do you spook easily, Starling?
Not yet, sir.
See, the one we want most,
refuses to cooperate.
I want you to go after him again today
in the asylum.
And who's the subject?
The psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter.
Hannibal the Cannibal.
I don't expect him to talk to you,
but I have to be able to say we tried.
So if he won't cooperate,
I want just straight reporting.
How's he look? How's his cell look?
Is he sketching, drawing?
If he is, what's he sketching?
Here's a dossier on Lecter.
A copy of our questionnaire
and a special ID for you.
Have your memo on my desk
by 0800 Wednesday.
Okay.
Excuse me, sir, but why the urgency?
Lecter's been in prison
for so many years now.
Is there some connection
between him and Buffalo Bill maybe?
I wish there were.
-I want your full attention, Starling.
-Yes, sir.
Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter.
Dr. Chilton at the asylum
will go over all the physical procedures
used with him.
Do not deviate from them
for any reason whatsoever,
and you're to tell him
nothing personal, Starling.
Believe me, you don't want
Hannibal Lecter inside your head.
Just do your job,
but never forget what he is.
And what is that?
Oh, he's a monster.
A pure psychopath.
So rare to capture one alive.
From a research point of view,
Lecter is our most prized asset.
Well.
You know, we get a lot of detectives here,
but I must say,
I can't ever remember one as attractive.
Will you be in Baltimore overnight?
Because this can be quite a fun town
if you have the right guide.
Well, I'm sure
this is a great town, Dr. Chilton,
but my instructions are to talk to
Dr. Lecter and report back this afternoon.
I see.
Let's make this quick, then.
We've tried to study him, of course,
but he's much too sophisticated
for the standard tests.
Oh, my, does he hate us!
He thinks I'm his nemesis.
Crawford's very clever, isn't he?
Using you.
What do you mean, sir?
A pretty young woman to turn him on.
I don't believe Lecter's even seen a woman
in eight years.
And, oh, are you ever his taste.
So to speak.
I graduated from UVA, Doctor.
It is not a charm school.
Good. Then you should be able
to remember the rules.
Do not touch the glass.
Do not approach the glass.
You pass him nothing but soft paper.
No pencils or pens.
No staples or paper clips on his paper.
Use the sliding food carrier.
No exceptions.
If he attempts to pass you anything,
do not accept it.
-Do you understand me?
-Yes, I understand, sir.
I'm going to show you
why we insist on such precautions.
On the afternoon of July 8, 1981,
he complained of chest pains
and was taken to the dispensary.
His mouthpiece and restraints
were removed for an EKG.
When the nurse leaned over him,
he did this to her.
The doctors managed to reset her jaw,
more or less,
save one of her eyes.
His pulse never got above 85,
even when he ate her tongue.
I keep him in here.
Dr. Chilton.
If Lecter feels that you're his enemy,
then, well, maybe we'll have more luck
if I go in by myself.
What do you think?
You might have suggested this
in my office and saved me the time.
Yes, sir, but then I would have missed
the pleasure of your company, sir.
When she's finished, bring her out.
Hi. I'm Barney.
He told you, don't get near the glass?
Yes, he did. Clarice Starling.
Nice to meet you, Clarice.
You can hang your coat up here if you like.
Thank you. I will.
He's past the others. The last cell.
You keep to the right.
I put out a chair for you.
Oh, yes. That's very good. Thank you.
I'll be watching. You'll do fine.
Hi.
I can smell your cunt.
Good morning.
Dr. Lecter, my name is Clarice Starling.
May I speak with you?
You're one of Jack Crawford's, aren't you?
I am, yes, sir.
May I see your credentials?
Certainly.
Closer, please.
Closer.
That expires in one week.
You're not real FBI, are you?
I'm still in training at the Academy.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
Yes. I'm a student.
I'm here to learn from you.
Maybe you can decide for yourself
whether or not I'm qualified enough
to do that.
That is rather slippery of you,
Agent Starling.
Sit, please.
Now, then. Tell me,
what did Miggs say to you?
Multiple Miggs in the next cell.
He hissed at you.
What did he say?
He said, "I can smell your cunt."
I see.
I myself cannot.
You use Evyan skin cream.
And sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps,
but not today.
Did you do all these drawings, Doctor?
That is the Duomo,
seen from the Belvedere.
You know Florence?
All that detail just from memory, sir?
Memory, Agent Starling,
is what I have instead of a view.
Well,
perhaps you'd care to lend us your view
on this questionnaire, sir.
Oh, no, no, no.
You were doing fine.
You had been courteous
and receptive to courtesy.
You had established trust
with the embarrassing truth about Miggs.
And now this ham-handed segue
into your questionnaire.
It won't do.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor.
Either you will or you won't.
Yeah.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed,
if he is recruiting help
from the student body.
Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill.
What a naughty boy he is.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill?
Please tell me. The newspapers won't say.
Well, it started as a bad joke
in Kansas City Homicide.
They said,
"This one likes to skin his humps."
Why do you think he removes their skins,
Agent Starling?
Enthrall me with your acumen.
It excites him.
Most serial killers keep
some sort of trophies from their victims.
I didn't.
No.
No, you ate yours.
You send that through now.
Oh, Agent Starling,
you think you can dissect me
with this blunt, little tool?
No.
I thought that your knowledge...
You're so ambitious, aren't you?
You know what you look like to me
with your good bag and your cheap shoes?
You look like a rube.
A well-scrubbed, hustling rube
with a little taste.
Good nutrition has given you
some length of bone,
but you're not more than one generation
from poor white trash,
are you, Agent Starling?
And that accent you've tried
so desperately to shed,
pure West Virginia.
What does your father do?
Is he a coal miner?
Does he stink of the lamp?
And, oh, how quickly the boys found you.
All those tedious, sticky fumblings
in the back seats of cars,
while you could only dream
of getting out, getting anywhere,
getting all the way to the FBI.
You see a lot, Doctor.
But are you strong enough to point
that high-powered perception at yourself?
What about it? Why don't you...
Why don't you look at yourself
and write down what you see?
Maybe you're afraid to.
A census-taker once tried to test me.
I ate his liver with some fava beans,
and a nice Chianti.
You fly back to school now, little Starling.
Fly, fly, fly.
I bit my wrist so I could die.
Look at the blood!
Gotcha!
Miggs! You stupid fuck!
Hannibal the Cannibal!
Agent Starling! Come back!
Agent Starling! Agent Starling!
I would not have had that happen to you.
Discourtesy is unspeakably ugly to me.
-Then do this test for me.
-No, but I will make you happy.
I'll give you a chance
for what you love most.
-And what is that, Doctor?
-Advancement, of course.
Now listen carefully. Look deep
within yourself, Clarice Starling.
Go seek out Miss Mofet,
an old patient of mine. M-o-f-e-t. Go now.
Doctor.
I don't think Miggs could manage again
quite so soon,
even though he is crazy.
Go now!
Hey, Bill.
Hey.
-Daddy!
-Hey, Clarice.
How are you?
Did you get any bad guys today, Daddy?
-No, angel, they all got away.
-Aw, shoot.
FBI! Hands up! Don't move!
Turn around!
Hands behind your back! Thumbs up.
You're dead, Starling.
Johnson, good job.
Good entry. Good commands.
-Starling, where's your danger area?
-In the corner, sir.
-Did you check the corner?
-No, sir.
That's the reason you're dead.
3109.
3109.
Breaking doors or windows
to enter or exit.
Rule 404...
-Clarice, phone. It's the guru.
-Crawford?
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Ardelia.
-Starling?
-Sir?
Miggs is dead.
Dead? How?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering
to him all afternoon, and Miggs crying.
They found him at bed check.
He'd swallowed his own tongue.
Starling?
Yeah, I'm still here, sir.
I just... I don't know
how to feel about this.
You don't have to feel any way about it.
Lecter did it to amuse himself.
Look, I know it got ugly today,
but you mentioned a name
at the end. Mofet.
Any follow-up on her?
Well, Lecter altered or destroyed
most of his patients' histories
prior to capture, so there's no record
of anyone named Mofet.
But I thought the "yourself" reference
was too hokey for Lecter,
so I figured, he's from Baltimore,
and I looked in the phone book,
and there's a "Your Self Storage" facility,
right outside of downtown Baltimore, sir.
Unit 31 was leased for 10 years,
prepaid in full.
The contract
is in the name of a Miss Hester Mofet.
So nobody's been in here since 1980?
Not to my knowledge.
Privacy is a great concern
to my customers.
Yes, I won't disturb anything. I promise.
I'll be out of here before you know it.
-Can I help you?
-Yes, actually, you can.
It's stuck.
We could return tomorrow with my son.
What about him?
I would ask my driver to help you,
but he detests physical labor.
Great.
You just stay here.
I'll be back in one minute.
It's stuck.
Hand me that flashlight, sir.
Oh.
If this door should fall down
or anything else,
this is the number
for our Baltimore field office.
Now, they know that you're with me.
You call them if anything should happen.
Yes, Miss Starling.
Clarice...
-They're waiting for you. Watch yourself.
-Thank you.
Hester Mofet.
It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?
Hester Mofet, "The rest of me."
"Miss The Rest Of Me,"
meaning that you rented that garage?
Thank you.
Your bleeding has stopped.
How did you...
It's nothing.
It's just a scratch.
Dr. Lecter, whose head is in that bottle?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Why, do you know something about him?
I might, if I saw the case file.
You could get that for me.
Why don't we talk about Miss Mofet?
You wanted me to find him.
His real name is Benjamin Raspail.
A former patient of mine,
whose romantic attachments ran to,
shall we say, the exotic.
I did not kill him, I assure you.
Merely tucked him away
very much as I found him,
after he'd missed three appointments.
If you didn't kill him, then who did, sir?
Who can say?
Best thing for him, really.
His therapy was going nowhere.
His dress, makeup...
Raspail was a transvestite?
In life? Oh, no.
Garden variety manic-depressive.
Tedious. Very tedious.
And I just think of him
as a kind of experiment,
a fledgling killer's first effort
at transformation.
How did you feel
when you saw him, Clarice?
Scared at first, then,
exhilarated.
Jack Crawford is helping your career,
isn't he?
Apparently, he likes you,
and you like him, too.
I never thought about it.
Do you think Jack Crawford
wants you sexually?
True, he is much older,
but do you think he visualizes
scenarios, exchanges,
fucking you?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor.
Frankly, it's the sort of thing
that Miggs would say.
Not anymore.
Thank you, Barney.
What happened to your drawings?
Punishment, you see, for Miggs.
Just like that gospel program.
When you leave,
they'll turn the volume way up.
Dr. Chilton does enjoy his petty torments.
What did you mean
by transformation, Doctor?
I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.
I know they will never,
ever let me out while I'm alive.
What I want is a view.
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.
I want to be in a federal institution
far away from Dr. Chilton.
What did you mean by fledgling killer?
Are you saying that he's killed again?
I'm offering you a psychological profile
on Buffalo Bill,
based on the case evidence.
I'll help you catch him, Clarice.
You know who he is, don't you?
Tell me who decapitated
your patient, Doctor.
All good things to those who wait.
I've waited, Clarice,
but how long can you
and old Jackie boy wait?
Our little Billy must already be searching
for that next special lady.
Hey, little cheeper.
I'll be right there.
Oh, shoot.
Goddamn it.
Perfect! Jesus.
Can I help you with that?
-Would you?
-Sure.
-Thank you.
-That's all right.
-You look kind of handicapped.
-Yeah.
I got it this far.
I just can't get it up in the truck.
Here. Just grab this.
Okay.
Good. Just set it down. That's good.
Get in the truck.
I want to push it all the way up.
-I really appreciate this. Thank you.
-All right.
-Yeah.
-Thank you.
Just go all the way back.
Okay. Is this good?
Yeah, that's good.
-That's great.
-Okay.
Say, are you about a size 14?
Sorry?
Good.
Oh, good. Good.
Hold!
Starling!
Outside. Let's go.
Cindy, in the ring for Starling. Let's go!
FBI! Hold it! Hold it right there!
Saddle up. Pack your field gear.
You're moving out.
-You're going with Crawford.
-Where?
Found a girl's body down in West Virginia.
Been in the water about a week.
Looks like a Buffalo Bill-type situation.
He keeps them alive for three days.
We don't know why.
There's no evidence
of rape or physical abuse prior to death.
All the mutilation you see there
is postmortem.
Okay, three days.
Then he shoots them, skins them,
and dumps them.
Each body in a different river.
The water leaves us no trace evidence
of any kind.
That's Fredrica Bimmel, the first one.
Her body was the only one
he took the trouble to weight down,
so actually, she was the third girl found.
After her, he got lazy.
Okay. Let's see.
Circles where the girls were abducted,
arrows where their bodies were found.
This new one today washed up here.
Elk River, West Virginia.
Look at him, Starling.
Tell me what you see.
Well, he's a white male.
Serial killers tend to hunt
within their own ethnic groups.
He's not a drifter.
He's got his own house somewhere,
not an apartment.
-Why?
-What he does with them takes privacy.
He's in his 30s or 40s.
He's got real physical strength,
combined with an older man's self-control.
He's cautious, precise.
And he's never impulsive. He'll never stop.
Why not?
He's got a real taste for it now.
He's getting better at his work.
Not bad, Starling.
-Questions?
-Yes, sir.
You haven't mentioned anything about
the information contained in my report
or Dr. Lecter's offer, sir.
I'm considering it.
That's why you sent me in there, isn't it?
To get his help on Buffalo Bill, sir?
Well, if that was the case, then I just...
I just wish I was in on it. That's all.
If I had sent you in there
with an actual agenda,
Lecter would have known it instantly.
He would have toyed with you,
then turned to stone.
Excuse me.
Sheriff Perkins, these are the FBI people.
Sheriff Perkins. Jack Crawford, FBI.
Special Agent Terry, Agent Starling.
We appreciate being invited
to your jurisdiction.
I didn't call you. That was somebody
from the State Attorney's office.
We'll extend you every courtesy,
but right now...
Sheriff, this type of sex crime
has certain aspects.
I'd just as soon discuss in private.
You know what I mean?
-Oscar, fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel.
-Yes, sir.
Starling, we're back here.
Tell Lamar to come on
when he's finished playing his music.
Yeah. We'll be sending in a minute.
Is this working?
I need a six-way linkup.
Chicago, Detroit...
What? What?
Excuse me! Excuse me, gentlemen.
You officers and gentlemen,
listen here now.
There's things we need to do for her.
I know that you all brought her this far
and that her folks would
thank you if they could
for your kindness and your sensitivity.
And now, please,
go on now and let us take care of her.
Go on, now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay, good.
Yeah, that's right. West Virginia. Elk River.
Stand by for transmission.
Ray.
Doctor, Lamar, let's take a look at her.
Oh, Jesus.
Okay, Starling.
Bill.
Star-shaped contact entrance wound
over the sternum.
Muzzle stamp at the top.
-Wrongful death.
-"Wrongful death."
She'll have to go
to the state pathologist at Claxton.
Well, I better get back to that service.
Lamar will help you.
Lord Almighty.
What else do you see, Starling?
Well, she's not local.
Her ears are pierced three times,
and there's...
Glitter nail polish. It looks like town to me.
Two of her fingernails are broken off,
and there's dirt or grit under them.
It looks like she's tried to claw her way
through something.
Ray, get pictures of her teeth.
We'll fax them through Missing Persons.
Right.
Let's do another.
She's got something in her throat.
When a body comes out of the water,
lots of times there's, like,
leaves and things in the mouth.
What is that, some kind of seedpod?
No, sir. That's a bug cocoon.
There's no way that could get
way down in there like that.
Not unless somebody shoved it in there.
She'll be easier to print
when we turn her over.
-Lamar, will you give me a hand with this?
-Yes, sir, I will.
Oh, Jack. What do you make of these?
Different configuration
than the other victims.
Get close-ups.
Victim's skin removed this time
in two large diamond-shaped sections
above the buttocks.
Stellate exit wound level with the second
or the third thoracic vertebrae
approximately six inches
from the right shoulder blade.
Starling?
When I told that sheriff
we shouldn't talk in front of a woman,
that really burned you, didn't it?
It was just smoke, Starling.
I had to get rid of him.
It matters, Mr. Crawford.
Cops look at you to see how to act.
-It matters.
-Point taken.
Ligature marks found around the wrists,
not around the ankles.
This would indicate
that the skinning was postmortem.
-Time, Pilch. My move.
-No fair. You lured him with produce.
Tough noogies. Still my turn.
Nice and slow, baby.
If the beetle moves one of your men,
does that still count?
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Agent Starling?
Where the heck did this come from?
It's practically mush.
It was found behind the soft palate
of a murder victim.
The body was in the Elk River,
West Virginia.
It's Buffalo Bill, isn't it?
I'm afraid I can't tell you
any more about that.
We heard about it on the radio.
You mean this is like a clue
from a real murder case? Cool!
Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.
A Sphingid. Ceratomia, maybe.
Boy, he's a big sucker.
Okay.
Let's check morphology.
What do you do when
you're not detecting, Agent Starling?
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
You ever go out
for cheeseburgers and beer?
The amusing house wine?
-Are you hitting on me, Doctor?
-Yes.
-Got you.
-What do you got, Roden?
Agent Starling, meet Mr. Acherontia styx.
Weird.
Better known to his friends
as the Death's Head Moth.
-And where does it come from?
-That's what's strange.
-They only live in Asia.
-Asia?
In this country, they'd have to be
specially raised from imported eggs.
Somebody grew this guy,
fed him honey and nightshade,
kept him warm.
Somebody loved him.
Where are you?
Let me out of here!
Please don't leave!
Talk to me, please!
Why won't you answer me? Please!
Good morning. I'm Donna Ferucchi.
I'm Gene Cassel with sports.
And I'm Tim Langhorn.
Our top story for this morning.
Catherine Martin,
the 25-year-old daughter
of Senator Ruth Martin,
listed first as a missing person,
is now believed to have been kidnapped
by the serial killer
known only as Buffalo Bill.
Memphis police sources indicate
that the missing girl's blouse
has been identified, sliced up the back
in what has become a kind of grim,
all-too-familiar calling card.
Young Catherine Martin, as we've said,
is the only daughter of
U.S. Senator Ruth Martin,
the Republican junior senator
from Tennessee.
And while her kidnapping is not,
at this point,
considered to be politically motivated,
nevertheless, it has stirred
the government to its highest levels.
Reached for a comment
on the ski slopes of Stowe, Vermont,
the president himself said to be,
and I quote, "Intensely concerned."
Just moments ago, Senator Martin
-taped this dramatic personal plea.
-Excuse me.
I'm speaking now
to the person who is holding my daughter.
Catherine is very gentle and kind.
Talk to her, and you'll see.
You have the power. You are in charge.
I know you can feel love and compassion.
You have a wonderful chance
to show the whole world
that you can be merciful as well as strong,
that you're big enough to treat Catherine
better than the world has treated you.
You have that power.
Please.
My daughter is Catherine.
-Boy, that's smart.
-Release her unharmed.
Jesus, that's really smart.
She keeps repeating the name.
If he sees Catherine as a person
and not just an object,
-it's harder to tear her up.
-Please. Release my little girl.
What you're doing, Miss Starling,
is coming into my hospital
to conduct an interview
and refusing to share information with me
for the third time.
Sir, I told you,
this is just a routine follow-up
on the Raspail case.
-He is my patient. I have rights.
-I understand that, sir.
Look, I am not just some turnkey,
Miss Starling.
This is the number for
the U.S. Attorney's office.
Please, either you discuss this with him,
or you let me do my job.
Do you understand?
If your profile helps us catch Buffalo Bill
in time to save Catherine Martin,
the senator promises you a transfer
to the V.A. Hospital
at Oneida Park, New York,
with a view of the woods nearby.
Maximum security still applies, of course.
You'd have reasonable access to books.
Best of all, though.
One week of the year,
you get to leave the hospital and go here.
Plum Island.
Every day of that week
you may walk on the beach,
you may swim in the ocean
for up to one hour,
under SWAT team surveillance, of course.
And there you have it.
A copy of the Buffalo Bill case file.
A copy of the senator's offer.
This offer is non-negotiable and final.
If Catherine Martin dies, you get nothing.
"Plum Island
Animal Disease Research Center."
Sounds charming.
That's only part of the island.
There's a very, very nice beach.
-Terns nest there. There's beautiful...
-Terns?
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be "turns" with us, too.
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.
Not about this case, though.
About yourself.
Quid pro quo. Yes or no?
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting.
Go, Doctor.
What is your worst memory of childhood?
The death of my father.
Tell me about it. And don't lie, or I'll know.
He was a town marshal,
and one night he surprised two burglars
coming out of the back of a drugstore.
They shot him.
Was he killed outright?
No. He was very strong.
He lasted more than a month.
My mother died when I was very young,
so my father had become
the whole world to me,
and when he left me, I had nothing.
I was ten years old.
You're very frank, Clarice.
I think it would be quite something
to know you in private life.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
So tell me about Miss West Virginia.
Was she a large girl?
Yes.
-Big through the hips? Roomy?
-They all were.
What else?
She had an object
deliberately inserted into her throat.
Now, that hasn't been made public yet.
We don't know what it means.
Was it a butterfly?
Yes. A moth.
Just like the one we found
in Benjamin Raspail's head an hour ago.
Why does he place them there, Doctor?
The significance of the moth is change.
Caterpillar into chrysalis or pupa,
and from thence into beauty.
Our Billy wants to change, too.
There's no correlation in literature
between transsexualism and violence.
-Transsexuals are very passive...
-Clever girl.
You're so close
to the way you're gonna catch him.
-Do you realize that?
-No. Tell me why.
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.
What happened next?
I don't imagine the answer
is on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I went to live with my mother's cousin
and her husband in Montana.
They had a ranch.
-Was it a cattle ranch?
-Sheep and horses.
-How long did you live there?
-Two months.
-Why so briefly?
-I ran away.
Why, Clarice?
Did the rancher make you perform fellatio?
Did he sodomize you?
No. He was a very decent man.
Quid pro quo, Doctor.
Billy is not a real transsexual.
But he thinks he is. He tries to be.
He's tried to be a lot of things, I expect.
And you said that I was very close
to the way we would catch him.
What did you mean, Doctor?
There are three major centers
for transsexual surgery.
Johns Hopkins, the University of
Minnesota, and Columbus Medical Center.
I wouldn't be surprised
if Billy had applied for sex reassignment
at one or all of them and been rejected.
On what basis would they reject him?
Look for severe childhood disturbances
associated with violence.
Our Billy wasn't born a criminal, Clarice.
He was made one
through years of systematic abuse.
Billy hates his own identity, you see,
and he thinks that makes him
a transsexual.
But his pathology
is a thousand times more savage
and more terrifying.
It rubs the lotion on its skin.
It does this whenever it's told.
Mister, my family will pay cash.
Whatever ransom you're asking for,
they'll pay it.
It rubs the lotion on its skin,
or else it gets the hose again.
Yes, she will, Precious.
She will get the hose.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay. I'm there.
Okay.
Mister, if you let me go,
I won't press charges.
I promise.
See, my mom is a real important woman.
I guess you already know that.
Now it places the lotion in the basket.
Please! Please! I want to go home.
I want to go home, please!
Please, I want to...
It places the lotion in the basket.
I want to see my mommy! Please.
I want to see my mother again.
I want to see my mommy.
Put the fucking lotion in the basket!
You still think you're gonna
walk on some beach and see the birdies?
No, I don't think so.
I called Senator Ruth Martin.
She never heard of any deal with you.
They scammed you, Hannibal.
Stand outside
and shut the door.
Barney.
There never was a deal
with Senator Martin, but there is now.
I designed it.
Of course, I worked in a few conditions
for my own benefit as well.
Identify Buffalo Bill by name
and if the girl is found in time,
Senator Martin will have you
transferred to
Brushy Mountain State Prison
in Tennessee.
Answer me, Hannibal.
You answer me now,
or by God, you'll never leave this cell.
Who is Buffalo Bill?
His first name is Louis.
I'll tell the rest to the Senator herself,
but only in Tennessee,
and I have a few conditions of my own.
Clean him up and get him ready to go.
Jack, Hannibal Lecter
is being transferred to Memphis.
Transferred?
Did you have a trainee
make some sort of phony offer to Lecter
in the Senator's name?
Yeah. I rolled the dice. I had to.
Well, she's mad as hell, Jack.
Paul Krendler's over here from Justice.
She's asking him to take over in Memphis.
Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter.
I'm Lieutenant Boyle.
This is Sergeant Patrick.
Now, we're gonna treat you
as good as you treat us.
You be a gentleman,
you gonna get three hots and a cot.
Sir. If you sign right here,
we'll have us a legal transfer.
Where is it?
Here, sir. Use mine.
Senator Martin, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
Dr. Lecter,
I brought an affidavit
guaranteeing your new rights.
You'll want to read it before I sign.
I won't waste your time or Catherine's
time bargaining for petty privileges.
Clarice Starling
and that awful Jack Crawford
have wasted far too much time already.
I only pray they haven't doomed
the poor girl.
Let me help you now
and I will trust you when it is all over.
You have my word. Paul?
Buffalo Bill's real name is Louis Friend.
I met him just once.
He was referred to me in April
or May, 1980,
by my patient Benjamin Raspail.
They were lovers, you see.
But Raspail had become very frightened.
Apparently, Louis had murdered
a transient
and done things with her skin.
We need his address
and a physical description.
Tell me, Senator.
Did you nurse Catherine yourself?
-What?
-Did you breast-feed her?
-Now, wait a minute!
-Yes, I did.
-Toughened your nipples, didn't it?
-You son of a bitch!
Amputate a man's leg,
and he can still feel it tickling.
Tell me, Mom,
when your little girl is on the slab,
where will it tickle you?
Take this thing back to Baltimore.
Five-foot-ten, strongly built,
about 180 pounds.
Hair, blond. Eyes, pale blue.
He'd be about 35 now.
He said he lived in Philadelphia,
but may have lied.
That's all I can remember, Mom.
But if I think of any more,
I will let you know.
Oh, and, Senator, just one more thing.
Love your suit.
I tell you now
that in a meeting earlier this evening
with Senator Ruth Martin,
Dr. Lecter agreed
to assist in the investigation
of trying to find the abductor
of Catherine Martin, Buffalo Bill.
How do you fit in, sir?
Well, it's only through
my own unique insight
into Lecter's mind
that this breakthrough was possible.
And Buffalo Bill's real name...
Buffalo Bill's real name is now a matter
of record with the proper authorities.
-Can you give us any more information?
-My name is Dr. Frederick Chilton.
-How do you spell that?
-C-H...
-Are you with Dr. Chilton's group?
-Oh, well, I just saw him outside, sir.
Access to Lecter is strictly limited.
We've been getting death threats.
I understand, sir.
Log in. Check your weapon.
Well, I can't take all the credit for myself.
Senator Martin, the Justice Department,
the people at the FBI,
the folks at the Baltimore State Hospital.
And now for the hard part,
apprehending the suspect.
Excuse me, folks,
I'm gonna have to catch a flight.
Command desk. Officer Jacobs.
Is it true what they're saying?
He's some kind of vampire?
They don't have a name for what he is.
You do know the rules, ma'am?
Yes, Lieutenant Boyle.
I've questioned him before.
Go ahead.
Good evening, Clarice.
I thought you might like
your drawings back, Doctor.
Just until you get your view.
How very thoughtful.
Or did Jack Crawford send you
for one last wheedle
before you're both booted off the case?
No. I came because I wanted to.
People will say we're in love.
Anthrax Island.
That was an especially nice touch, Clarice.
-Yours?
-Yes.
Yeah! That was good.
Pity about poor Catherine, though.
Your anagrams are showing, Doctor.
Louis Friend?
Iron sulfide, also known as Fool's Gold.
Oh, Clarice. Your problem is
you need to get more fun out of life.
You were telling me the truth
back in Baltimore, sir.
Please continue now.
Well, I have read the case files, have you?
Everything you need to find him
is right there in those pages.
-Then tell me how.
-First principles, Clarice. Simplicity.
Read Marcus Aurelius.
Of each particular thing,
ask what is it in itself?
What is its nature?
What does he do, this man you seek?
He kills women.
No! That is incidental.
What is the first
and principal thing he does?
What needs does he serve by killing?
Anger.
Social acceptance
and sexual frustrations...
No! He covets.
That is his nature.
And how do we begin to covet, Clarice?
Do we seek out things to covet?
Make an effort to answer now.
No. We just...
No. We begin by coveting
what we see every day.
Don't you feel eyes
moving over your body, Clarice?
And don't your eyes
seek out the things you want?
All right. Yes. Now please tell me how.
No. It is your turn to tell me, Clarice.
You don't have any more vacations to sell.
Why did you leave that ranch?
Doctor, we don't have any more time
for any of this now.
But we don't reckon time the same way,
do we, Clarice?
This is all the time you'll ever have.
Later. Now, please, listen to me.
We've only got five...
No! I will listen now.
After your father's murder,
you were orphaned.
You were ten years old.
You went to live with cousins
on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana.
And?
And one morning, I just ran away.
Not "just", Clarice. What set you off?
-You started at what time?
-Early. Still dark.
Then something woke you, didn't it?
Was it a dream? What was it?
I heard a strange noise.
What was it?
It was screaming.
Some kind of screaming,
like a child's voice.
What did you do?
I went downstairs, outside.
I crept up into the barn.
I was so scared to look inside, but I had to.
And what did you see, Clarice?
What did you see?
Lambs. They were screaming.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
And they were screaming.
-And you ran away?
-No.
First I tried to free them.
I opened the gate to their pen,
but they wouldn't run.
They just stood there, confused.
They wouldn't run.
But you could and you did, didn't you?
Yes. I took one lamb,
and I ran away as fast as I could.
-Where were you going, Clarice?
-I don't know.
I didn't have any food, any water,
and it was very cold, very cold.
I thought if I could save just one, but,
he was so heavy.
He was so heavy.
I didn't get more than a few miles
when the sheriff's car picked me up.
The rancher was so angry,
he sent me to live
at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman.
I never saw the ranch again.
What became of your lamb, Clarice?
They killed him.
You still wake up sometimes, don't you?
Wake up in the dark
and hear the screaming of the lambs.
Yes.
And you think if you save poor Catherine,
you could make them stop, don't you?
You think if Catherine lives,
you won't wake up in the dark ever again
to that awful screaming of the lambs.
I don't know. I don't know.
Thank you, Clarice. Thank you.
Tell me his name, Doctor.
Dr. Chilton, I presume.
I think you know each other.
Okay.
-We found her.
-Let's go!
It's your turn, Doctor.
-Out.
-Tell me his name.
Sorry, ma'am, I've got orders.
I have to put you on a plane.
Come on now.
Brave Clarice.
You will let me know when
those lambs stop screaming, won't you?
Tell me his name, Doctor!
Clarice!
Your case file.
Goodbye, Clarice.
Ready when you are, Doc.
Just another minute, please.
The son of a bitch
demanded a second dinner.
Lamb chops, extra rare.
Wonder what he wants for breakfast.
Some damn thing from the zoo?
Good evening, gentlemen.
-Okay, Doc. Grab some floor.
-Same drill as before, please.
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.
Okay.
Hand me that, would you?
Thanks.
Mind the drawings, please.
Thank you.
-Jimmy, watch it! He's got me!
-Jesus, Bill!
Jesus Christ!
Ready when you are, Sergeant Pembry.
What is this shit?
-Did somebody go up on five?
-No. Nobody went up.
Call Pembry. Ask him...
CP, shots fired on five. Repeat.
-Shots fired on five.
-Sergeant Tate.
Holy shit.
What the hell? Bitch!
Shut up.
-Bobby, get the vest.
-Right, Sarge.
-Brady, Howard...
-Look!
It stopped.
Seal off a 10 block radius.
Get me the SWAT team
and an ambulance double-quick.
We're going up.
Pembry!
Boyle!
Oh, God!
Go.
-Clear!
-Clear!
Command post, two officers down.
-Clear!
-Clear!
Lecter's gone, Sarge.
The prisoner is missing.
Boyle's gun is gone, Sergeant.
Repeat. Lecter is missing and armed.
He stripped the bed.
Might be making a rope.
Check all windows.
Where the fuck is my ambulance?
He's alive.
Sergeant Tate, he's alive!
Get a hold of him where you can
feel his hands, son. Talk to him.
What do I say?
It's Jim Pembry! Now talk to him, damn it!
Lecter is missing and armed.
Pembry. Pembry, can you hear me?
He took Boyle's gun.
Pembry got off one round.
There's a chance Lecter was hit.
Keep breathing in and out. That's it.
You're doing a good job.
You look real good there.
Yeah, you look... You look real good.
-You ready?
-Let's go.
-Let's do it.
-Let's go.
Looking good, Pembry.
You're gonna make it.
You're just fine. You're doing all right.
That's right.
-Okay, I need that IV now.
-Lactated ringers.
Can we get the strap?
Where's the fucking oxygen?
-Looking good, buddy. That's right.
-Bob!
Stay with me. Stay with me here.
We're losing him. Downstairs. Take him!
And up!
-Elevator!
-Out of the way!
Out of the way!
CP to Tate.
Roger, Lieutenant. Tate here.
I'm on the elevator bringing Pembry down.
He seems to be hanging on.
Top three floors secured.
Main stairwell secured.
We think he's on two.
Tate, are you still with me?
We're pretty sure
he's somewhere on two, sir.
That's all for now. Over.
He's on the roof of the elevator.
Okay, guys.
I see him.
There's a gun by his hand.
He's not moving.
One warning. We need him alive.
Got him.
Lecter.
Put your hands on your head.
One in the leg.
No movement.
Johnny, hold your fire.
We're coming into the car.
-We're opening the hatch.
-Watch his hands.
If there's any fire,
it'll come from us. Affirm.
Got it.
Memphis General, this is Medical Unit 26.
We're inbound with a 50-year-old
male police officer
with severe facial lacerations.
Weapon unknown.
We've got grand mal seizure activity,
but he's postictal now.
Copy that.
Vital signs are good.
Pressure is 130 over 90.
-Ninety?
-Yeah, that's right. 90.
Pulse, 84.
We've got him on lactated ringers running.
And the patient is on 10 liters...
They found the ambulance
in a parking garage at Memphis Airport.
The crew was dead.
He killed a tourist, too.
Got his clothes, cash.
By now he could be anywhere.
-He won't come after me.
-Oh, really?
No, he won't. I can't explain it.
He would consider that rude.
It's over. She's dead.
It's not your fault it worked out like this.
The thing is that,
Lecter said everything we need
to catch him with is right here
in these pages, only I can't...
-Dr. Lecter said a lot of things.
-He's here, Ardelia.
Is this Lecter's handwriting?
"Clarice, doesn't this random scattering
of sites
"seem desperately random?
Like the elaboration of a bad liar.
"Ta, Hannibal Lecter."
Desperately random? What does he mean?
Not random at all maybe.
Like there's some pattern here.
Yeah, but there is no pattern,
or the computers would have nailed it.
They're even found in random order.
Random because of the one girl.
The one he weighted down.
-Fredrica Bimmel...
-Right.
From Belvedere, Ohio.
First girl taken, third body found. Why?
Well, she didn't drift.
He weighted her down.
What did Lecter say
about the first principles?
Simplicity.
What does this guy do? He covets.
How do we first start to covet?
-We covet what we see...
-Every day.
-Hot damn, Clarice.
-He knew her.
-Mr. Bimmel?
-That's me.
Hello. I'm Clarice Starling.
I'm with the FBI.
I sure appreciate you letting me
take a look around, Mr. Bimmel.
I don't know nothing new to tell you.
Police been back here
so many times already.
Fredrica went into Chicago on the bus
to see about a job.
She left the interview okay.
She never come home.
Her bedroom's how she left it.
Upstairs. Door to the left.
He's making himself a woman suit,
Mr. Crawford, out of real women.
And he can sew, this guy.
He's very skilled.
-He's a tailor or a dressmaker or...
-Starling...
That's why they're all so big.
He has to keep them alive
so he can starve them a while,
-so he can loosen their skin and take...
-Starling.
Starling. Starling,
we know who he is and where he is.
-We're on our way right now.
-Where?
Calumet City, edge of Chicago.
Be on the ground in 45 minutes with HRT.
Oh, that's great news, sir, but how...
Johns Hopkins came up with some names.
We fed him into "Known Offenders."
Subject's name is Jamie Gumb,
AKA John Grant.
Lecter's description is accurate.
He just lied about the name.
Listen to this.
Customs had some paper on him.
They stopped a carton two years ago
at LAX.
Live caterpillars from Surinam.
The addressee was a Jame Gumb.
Well, Chicago's only 400 miles from here.
-I'll be there in...
-No, no, no, Starling.
There's not enough time.
We want him for murder, not kidnapping.
I need you to link him to the Bimmel girl
before he's indicted.
-See what you can dredge up in Belvedere.
-Yes, sir. You bet. I'll do my best.
Starling, we wouldn't have found him
without you.
Nobody's gonna forget that.
Least of all me.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford?
Thanks for the scraps, asshole.
I got a better idea.
Okay, Precious. Time for a little treat.
Precious!
Come on, girl!
Come on, Precious. Come on, Precious!
Come on, Precious!
I got a yummy, yummy snack for you.
Come on. Come and get it.
Precious!
Are you up there, you little shit?
Come and get it, pretty girl.
Precious. Please come. Come on.
Come on...
Would you fuck me?
Come on. Take that bone. Come on.
Come on. Come. Come on.
I'd fuck me.
Come on.
I'd fuck me hard.
I'd fuck me so hard.
No.
Is that a good job, FBI agent?
You get to travel around and stuff?
I mean, better places than this?
Sometimes you do.
Freddie was so happy for me
when I got this job at the bank.
Toaster giveaways and Barry Manilow
on the speakers all day.
She thought it was such hot shit.
What did she know? Big dummy.
Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a man
named Jamie Gumb or a Jame Gumb?
-How about John Grant?
-No.
Oh, would she have had a friend
that you didn't know about, or...
No way. If she had a guy, I'd have known,
believe me.
Sewing was her life.
Did you two ever work together?
Oh, sure. Me and Pam Malavesi
used to help her
do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman.
Can you give me Mrs. Lippman's address?
I need to talk to her.
So powerful. So beautiful.
Precious?
Precious?
Down here, you sack of shit!
Put her in that bucket.
No! You get me a telephone
and lower it down here. Now!
Poolie-poo. Precious.
Darling heart, are you all right?
She's in a lot of pain, mister.
She needs a vet.
She broke her leg on the way down.
I know it. She's been licking...
Hey, don't you hurt my dog!
-Don't you make me hurt your dog!
-Oh, you don't know what pain is!
Get me a live telephone line down here
or the dog's dead!
Damn fuck.
Get me that telephone!
I'm gonna do it, mister!
I'll snap her neck off. I swear to God!
You little fuck.
Down here! Down here!
Help!
Okay, I'm coming.
We're going in.
Good afternoon. Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family.
-FBI! Everybody down!
-Everybody down, now!
No. The Lippmans don't live here anymore.
No. Excuse me, sir.
I really need to speak with you.
-Clear!
-Clear!
What's the problem, Officer?
Well, I'm investigating the death
of Fredrica Bimmel.
There's no one here, Jack.
Clarice.
Your name is?
-Oh, Jack Gordon.
-Mr. Gordon. Good.
Well, Fredrica used to work
for Mrs. Lippman. Did you know her?
No.
Oh, wait.
Was she a great, big fat person?
-Yes. She was a big girl, sir.
-Yeah, I...
I may have...
No, I read about her in the newspaper.
Mrs. Lippman had a son.
Maybe he could help you.
I got his card in here someplace.
Do you want to come in while I look for it?
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.
Thank you.
Are you close to catching somebody,
you think?
Yes. We may be.
Did you
take over this place
after Mrs. Lippman died? Is that right?
Yeah. I bought this house two years ago.
Did she leave any records,
any business records,
tax forms, list of employees?
No. Nothing like that at all.
Say, has the FBI learned something?
The police around here
don't seem to have the first clue.
I mean, have you got, like, a description,
fingerprints, anything like that?
No.
No, we don't.
Yeah. Here's that number.
Very good, Mr. Gordon.
May I use your phone, please?
Sure you can use my phone.
Freeze!
Put your hands over your head!
And turn around! Spread your legs!
Spread your legs!
Put your hands in the back! Thumbs up!
Freeze!
Hey!
Hello! Are you there?
I'm down here! I'm down here!
-Catherine Martin?
-Yes!
FBI! You're safe!
Safe, shit! Get me out of here!
You're all right, Catherine. Where is he?
How the fuck should I know?
Just get me out of here!
Catherine, you've got to be quiet.
Now shut that dog up!
Just get me out of here!
Oh, my God.
Catherine, I'm going to get you
out of there,
but right now, you listen to me.
I've got to leave this room.
I'll be right back.
No! Don't you leave me here,
you fucking bitch!
No! Don't you leave me here!
This guy's fucking crazy!
Please!
I've got to get out of here!
Catherine, the other officers will be here
any minute now!
Wait!
Don't go! Please!
Quiet!
Oh, God!
No...
-You okay?
-Gunpowder. It's nothing. I'm okay.
Agent Starling, how did you track
Buffalo Bill to this address?
Clarice M. Starling.
Congratulations.
Ernest W. Stevens.
-Special Agent Starling.
-Oh, Special Agent Mapp.
-Phone call.
-Thank you.
-Excuse me, gentlemen.
-Starling.
Pilch, could you take our picture?
Sure.
Look, I just wanted to say congratulations.
And I'm not much good
at this kind of thing,
so I'm gonna duck out of here.
Okay, sure.
Thank you, Mr. Crawford.
Your father would have been proud today.
Don't forget your phone call.
Starling.
Well, Clarice,
have the lambs stopped screaming?
Dr. Lecter.
Don't bother with a trace.
I won't be on long enough.
-Where are you, Dr. Lecter?
-I have no plans to call on you, Clarice.
The world's more interesting
with you in it.
So you take care now
to extend me the same courtesy.
You know I can't make that promise.
I do wish we could chat longer, but...
I'm having an old friend for dinner.
Bye.
Dr. Lecter...
Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Lecter.
Dr. Lecter.
Hey, what? Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.
-Is the security system all set up?
-We have the big-shot security.
