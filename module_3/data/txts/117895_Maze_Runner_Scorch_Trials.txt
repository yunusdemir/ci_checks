Remember.
I love you.
I love you, Thomas.
Mom!
Mom!
Thomas,
it's okay.
Thomas!
Thomas!
No !!!
Thomas!
Wake up, we got to go!
Come on!
Let's go!
Move, we got to go!
Wait, wait, wait...!
Where're you going!
We don't have time!
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go.
Get out of here!
Breaks!
Make breaks!
We got to move.
- You're not safe out here.
Alright, kids, let's go.
Let's go! Move it!
Keep moving.
Keep moving.
Help them take off!
Quick!
THE
SCORCH TRIALS
You kids doing alright?
Sorry about all the fuss.
We have ourselves a bit of a swarm.
Who are you?
I'm the reason you're all still alive.
It's my intention to keep you that way.
Now, come with me.
We'll get you kids squared away.
You can call me Mr. Janson.
I run this place.
For us, it's a sanctuary, safe from
the horrors of the outside world.
You all should think of it
as a way station.
Kind of a home between homes.
Watch yourselves..
And then you're taking us home?
A home of sorts.
Sadly there wouldn't be much left
of wherever you came from.
But we do have a place for you,
a refuge, outside the Scorch,
... where WCKD will never find you again.
How does that sounds?
Why are you helping us?
Let's just say the world out is
in a rather precarious situation.
We're all hanging on
by a very thin thread.
The fact that you kids
can survive the Flare virus
makes you the best chance
of humanity's continue survival.
Unfortunately, it also makes you a target.
There's no doubt by now
you've noticed.
Beyond this door, lies the
beginning of your new lives.
First things first.
Let's do something about that smell.
Great.
- What is that?
- Just a little cocktail.
Calcium, folic, pheno A to Z,
pretty much everything
you've been deprived of out there.
Try to relax.
Sure you get enough of that?
- Good evening, Dr. Crawford.
- Good evening.
- How're the new arrivals holding up?
- So far so good.
Alright.
You must Teresa.
Thomas?
- Yeah?
- Come with me please.
Thomas, thank you for seeing me.
Sorry for the inconvenience,
I was just hoping we...
might get a moment to chat in private,
away from the others.
Well...
I won't take up
too much of your time.
Well, I only have one question:
What do you remember from WCKD;
You're not in trouble.
I'm just having a conversation.
I'm just trying to understand.
Understand what?
Whose side are you on.
I remember I used to
work for WCKD.
I remember they sent me
into the maze.
I remember watching
my friends die in front of me.
I on their side.
Interesting.
You say you worked for WCKD,
but they sent you into the Maze.
Why would they do
something like that?
I don't know. Maybe you should
ask them before you kill them all.
I'll be sure to
keep that in mind.
Enjoy the rest of your stay.
That's it?
Yeah, you've told me
everything I need to know.
You and your friends have all
been cleared to join the others.
Soon you all will be moving on
to greener pastures.
Wait.
Others?
Hey Thomas!
Hey, Minho
What's going on?
We weren't the only Maze.
And there was this big loud explosion.
And these guys came out of nowhere.
- They started shooting up the place.
- It was intense.
- They pulled us off the Maze and brought us here.
- What about the rest?
The other people left behind in the Maze,
what happened to them?
I don't know.
I guess WCKD still has them.
- How long you guy's been here?
- Not long , just a days or 2.
That kid over there,
He's been here the longest.
Almost one week.
His Maze is nothing but girls.
Really?
Some guys has all the luck.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ladies.
You all know how this works.
If you heard your name called
please rise in an orderly fashion
and join my colleagues...
behind me where they will
escort you to the eastern wing.
Your new lives are about to begin.
Connor.
Adeline.
Justin.
Peter.
Alison.
Squeegee.
Alright, settle down.
Franklin and Abigail.
Now, now. Don't get discouraged.
If I could take more, I would.
There's always tomorrow.
Your time will come.
Go on, eat up.
Where are they going?
Far from here.
Lucky bastard.
Some kind of farm.
A safe place.
They can only take in
a couple of you at a time.
Hey, Teresa.
Teresa!
Hey.
Hey hey hey.
Where're they taking her?
Just have to run a few more tests.
Don't worry, they will be done with her soon.
Is she okay?
She's fine.
I'll have top bunk.
Too slow.
I could get used to this.
Yeah, it's not bad.
What do you think those guys
want with Teresa?
And if there is one thing I know about
that girl, is she can take care of herself.
Don't worry about it.
Down here.
Shhh, shhh.
Shhh.
Come on.
Follow me.
What?
Hurry.
This way.
Come on.
Hey, wait a second.
What the hell are we doing?
Come on, we're going to miss it.
What the hell am I doing?
What are we doing here?
Come here.
Watch.
What the hell was that?
They bring in new ones
every night.
- And what do they do with them?
- I don't know.
This is as far as I've gotten here
The vents didn't go into that section.
But once they go through that door,
they don't come back out.
I don't think anybody
ever leave this place.
Come on, we got to go before
someone noticed we're gone.
And why do you show me this?
Because maybe the others
will listen to you.
There's something weird going on here
and I know you think so too.
Hey, wait.
- What's your name?
- Aris.
<i>Alice.</i>
Barry.
Walt.
Edgar.
- Samantha.
- I want to know what's through that door.
Aaron.
No, we've been over this.
You said they were covered up,
so you don't know what you saw.
It could be
anything like that.
I know exactly what I saw.
They were bodies.
Aris say they bring in
a new batch every night.
Who the hell is Aris?
Henry.
Tim.
Well.
Are you sobbed?
And last but not least, David.
Thank you for your attention.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
Okay. Until we know
where this thing ends,
we should just keep our heads down and
try not to draw any attention to ourselves, alright?
- What is he doing?
- I think he is drawing attention to himself.
Whoa, hang on.
You weren't called.
- I'm just going to be a second.
- This is a restricted area.
I just want to see my friend,
can you let me through?
Get your ass
back in that chair..
- What's your problem, man?
- Back off!
- Why won't you let through?
- Take control of your friend!
What's happening here?
Thomas, thought we could
trust each other.
You know we're on
the same team here.
Are we?
Get them to their bunks.
Get in!
All of you!
Why the hell was that about?
You don't really think they were
just going to let you through?
No, of course I didn't.
No.
I'm going to find out what's
on the other side of that door.
Alright.
Look.
They're hiding something.
Okay, these people are
not who they say they are.
No, Thomas, you
don't know that.
The only thing that we do know is that
they helped rescued us from WCKD.
They gave us new clothes, they gave
us food, they gave us a proper.
Some of us haven't
had that in a long time.
- Yeah, but you...
- Some of us are a lot longer than others.
- Hey, Thomas.
- What the...
- You get it, right?
- Who is this kid?
Yeah, let's go.
Look, maybe you guys are right,
maybe I'm just being paranoid,
But I got to
find out for sure.
Just cover for me.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
Teresa?
It's Rachel.
They took her the first night.
I told her it's going to be okay.
You sure this can't wait?
She was very specific, sir.
She wanted to talk with you personally.
As if I don't have enough
to deal with.
Just... bear with me.
We are getting some
interference from the storm.
Come on, it's good enough,
make the connection.
Good evening, Dr. Paige.
Lovely to see you again.
Although I admit I... I wasn't expecting
to hear from you quite so soon.
<i>Change of plans, Janson.</i>
<i>I will be arriving a little sooner
than expected, first thing tomorrow.</i>
Oh!
We'll be delighted to have you.
I think you'll be pleased with
the progress we've made.
As you can see, earlier results
have been extremely promising.
Whatever it is you've been doing
to them in there, it's working.
<i>Not well enough.</i>
<i>I just received Board approval.</i>
<i>I want all the remaining subjects
sedated and prep for harvest</i>
<i>by the time I arrive.</i>
Doctor Paige, we're going
as fast as we can.
<i>- We are still running tests.
- Try something faster.</i>
<i>Until I can guarantee their security,
this is the best plan.</i>
Ma'am, security is my job.
We're on 24 hour lock down here.
I am assuring you,
the assets are secure.
<i>Have you found the Right Arm?</i>
Not yet.
We tracked them as far
as the mountains.
<i>So they're still out there.</i>
<i>And they've already hit
2 of our installations.</i>
<i>They want these kids,
as badly as we do,</i>
<i> and I cannot...
I cannot afford another loss.</i>
<i>Not now, when I'm
so close to a cure.</i>
<i>If you're not up to the task,
I'll find someone who is.</i>
That won't be necessary.
I would suggest we start
with the most recent arrivals.
<i>Just get it done!</i>
<i>Janson.</i>
<i>I don't want them
to feel any pain.</i>
They won't feel a thing.
Thomas!
- We got to go.
- What's up?
We got to go. We got to go,
right now! Come on!
- What the hell are you talking about?
- What do you mean we got to go?
You're coming.
Come on, we got to go.
Come on.
They're coming for us!
- What happened in there?
- Aris, what happened?
Thomas, can you just
calm down and talk to us.
- She's still alive.
- Who's she?
- Teresa?
- Ava. Ava.
Ava?
Would you just turn
around and talk to us.
It's WCKD!
It's still WCKD.
It's always been WCKD.
Thomas.
What did you see?
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, let's go!
Let's go!
You guys go away,
there's something I got to do.
- What're you talking about?
- Trust me, it's important.
You guys want to get out
of here, right?   Just go.
I'll go with him.
Okay. Winston, go, go.
Come on!
You sure we can
trust this kid?
You don't want to know
who you'll be without.
Ah!
What are you kids doing out?
I want this this place lock down,
call everyone in.
No one leaves unless
everyone is accounted for.
- Tell me if you got eyes on them.
- Still looking. Still looking.
Come on, come on, come on.
There!
- Who is that?
- Crawford.
They're going after the girl.
- Get everyone to the med wing.
- Yes, sir!
I want them alive!
Freeze!
Stay where you are!
Why are they shooting at us?
Minho.
What the hell are you doing?
Minho!
Shit.
Okay. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.
Dr. Crawford. Are you here to...
Wait, whoa whoa.
- Okay, okay!
- Where is she?
Where is she?
- Get down!
- Alright.
Teresa.
- Get back!
- Just do as he says.
- What did they do to you?
- Thomas.
Give me your hands!
You're never going
to get away with this.
What's going on?
We're going to get out of here,
right now. Right now, come on.
Guys, they're coming.
Where do we go?
Frypan, move.
Get back.
Get back!
They have the door barricade.
Guys.
We got to get out of here!
Where do we go?
We're seal in!
Newt.
Help help help!
Go go go!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on.
Come on.
- Hurry! Go!
- Come on. Come on.
Thomas!
Let's go!
Stay behind me.
Oh, shit.
Come on!
There it is. There it is
Come on.
Shit. Come on.
No, no, no...!
Thomas!
Open the door, Janson!
- You really don't want me to.
- Open the damn door!
Listen to me!
I'm trying to save your life.
The Maze is one thing, but you kids
wouldn't last 1 day out in Scorch.
If the elements don't kill you,
the Cranks will.
Thomas, you have to believe me.
I only want
what's best for you.
Yeah, let me guess.
WCKD is good?
You're not getting through
that door, Thomas.
- Hey, guys.
- Come on!
Thomas, come on!
Let's go!
Go go go.
Stop him!
Shut the main corridor door!
Shut the main corridor door!
Come on!
- Run!
- Thomas, come on!
Come on, Thomas!
Thomas, what's going on?
Come on.
You're insane.
Come on, Thomas, let's go!
Come on!
Come on, keep moving!
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, come on!
Come on, come on.
Keep going!
Come on, Go.
Go, we'll lose them in the storm.
I can see them over here
at the fence!
Go go go.
Stay low! Stay low!
- Teresa, hang on.
- I think we lost then.
- Come on, keep going!
- Come on, guys. Let's go.
- Watch out!
- Where are we even going?
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Over here!
- Come on.
- Teresa, wait.
Teresa!
- Get down here!
- Okay, come on.
Get inside.
Come on, let's go.
Go. Here, get in.
Let's go, guys.
Where the hell are we?
- We got to go.
- No.
- Look, we got to go.
- Thomas, stop!
Tell me what's going on.
It's WCKD.
It's WCKD.
They lied to us, we never escaped.
Mid air were strung bodies.
Too many to count.
What do you mean?
Dead bodies?
No, but they weren't alive either.
They have them strung up.
With tubes coming out of them.
They're being...
They're being drain.
There's something inside of us
that WCKD wants.
Something in our blood.
So we have to get as far away
from them as possible.
Okay.
So, what's the plan?
- You do have a plan, right?
- Yeah.
Well, we followed you
out here, Thomas.
And now you're saying that you have no idea
where we're going or what we're doing?
Wait.
Janson said something
... about people hiding in the mountains.
Some kind of resistance or army.
Right Arm.
Right Arm. If they're
really against WCKD,
maybe they can help us.
People.
In the mountains.
Mountain people
That's your plan?
It's the only chance we have.
Hey, guys.
Check this out.
Minho, give me the light.
Someone's been down here.
Come on.
Open up.
Looks like people lived here.
And where are they now?
Let's pack some of this stuff up.
Anything you think you might need.
We'll split up. See what else
we can find. Meet back here .
Wait, Thomas.
Let's go.
- Thomas.
- Yeah.
All those kids we left
behind back there...
I do not want to
end up like that.
Hey.
Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
- Good.
Hell,  What are we
looking for out here?
Signs of life.
People.
Survivors.
Anyone who can help us.
Does he count?
Shit.
They have power.
You alright?
I'm fine.
What?
Where did you go?
This looks promising.
Hey.
Minho, wait!
Thomas, watch out!
- Get back. Get back. Get back.
- Jesus.
Christ!
Oh!
Whoa.
What the hell is that thing?
Look out!
We got to move.
We got to move. Go!
- Hold it down!
- What?
Hold it down.
Minho, what are you doing?
Watch out!
Okay. Go go go.
Go go!
Let's get the hell
out of here!
Shit.
- Whats going on?
- I don't know.
Hey!
Hey!
Run!
Run!
Shit!
Hey!
Come on!
Get out of here!
- Get out!
- Come on!
Let's go go go!
Let's go.
Thomas, Minho.
What the hell are those things?
I don't know!
Just keep going!
Move!
Move!
Keep up!
Come on.
Let's go.
Shit!
Oh.
No no no.
- Aris, no!
- No!
Teresa!
Minho, come on!
Come on.
Come on.
Where are we going to go?
We got to find
a way out of here!
Go!
- Newt!
- Newt!
- Newt, you-you good?
- Yeah.
Thanks, Tommy!
- Come on!
- Come on, Newt!
Through here! Through here!
Let's go! They're coming!
Christ.
Where are we going?
- Keep it up! Go, go!
- Come on.
- Keep going!
- Come on, they're coming!
It's a dead end!
Get us out of here, Thomas!
This way!
Go!
I'll hold them back!
Harder!
Get the door open!
Come on, it's open!
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on!
Come on!
- Get off me! Help!
- Pull!
Pull!
Keep pulling.
Go go go!
- Hurry!
- Let's go!
- Minho, go. I'm right behind you.
- Let's go, let's go!
Hey. Hey. Hey!
Get out of here!
Are they're gone.
Yeah.
We're safe, for now.
We should get moving.
Let's pack it up.
Aris, come on.
Fry. Winston.
Let's go.
Hey, man.
You okay?
What the hell happen
to this place?
I don't know.
It doesn't look like anyone's
been here in a long time.
Hope the whole world
is not like this.
Whoa, hang on.
Stop.
Did you hear that?
Get down!
Everybody hide! Hide! Hide!
Get in here.
In here. In here.
They are never going to
stop looking for us, are they?
Everyone good?
A little further, guys.
Those mountains.
It's got to be it.
That's where we're going.
It's a long way out.
Then we better get moving.
Winston!
Hey, Winston.
Winston!
- Winston!
- He's hurt pretty bad.
What do we do?
Winston, can you hear me?
- Is he okay?
- No.
Hang in there, Winston.
- Thomas.
- Grab his leg.
I got them.
I got them.
We got to find shelter.
Looks like they are
getting further away.
We just got to keep moving.
We can make it.
How's it looking?
It's a little further.
That's not very convincing.
Hey, what's going on with you?
They did something to me.
At first I just felt like I was
waking up from a dream or something.
And then they all
started coming back.
Your memory?
What do you remember?
I remember the first time
they brought you in.
I was taller than you then.
And faster.
Okay.
I remember why we were there.
We thought we could
fix all this.
I think we should go back.
- What?
- Just-Just listen to me.
What are you talking about? Go back?
After everything they've done to us?
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, I think it is that simple.
No.
You don't understand.
What.
What don't I understand?
Everything was fine,
until you...
What?
Nothing.
Teresa, what aren't you telling me?
- Hey! Guys, come down here!
- Oh my god.
Winston, what are you doing, man?
Give me that!
- What's going on?
- What happened?
I don't know! He just woke up and
grabbed the gun and he tried to...
Winston.
Winston, you okay?
It's growing...
inside me.
I'm not going to make it.
Please.
Please.
Don't let me turn into
one of those... things.
Hey, Newt.
Thank you.
Now, get out of here.
Goodbye, Winston.
Go.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Thomas.
Take care of them.
I thought we were
suppose to be immune.
Not all of us.
I guess.
If Winston can get infected,
we should assume so can the rest of us.
I never thought
I would say it.
I missed the Glade.
Get up.
Yo, get up.
- Come on, let's go. Get up, Frypan.
- Aris, I see something.
What? What is it?
What?
See that?
It's lights.
We made it.
- Let's go! We got to go.
- Yeah.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
- Hurry!
- Go!
Run!
- Keep moving, come on!
- Let's go!
Come on, Teresa!
Go go go!
We're getting closer!
Keep going!
Come on!
Come on!
Get inside, go!
Minho!
Hey.
Hey.
Come on, man.
Come on, get him up.
- Go! Go!
- Keep going!
Go!
Move!
Come on, hurry up!
- Come on!
- Get in!
- What did you say?
- Who's got a light.
Minho!
Come on, come on, come on.
- Minho!
- Minho!
- Come on, Minho.
- Come on.
Come on, man!
You okay?
What happened?
You were struck by lightning.
Oh.
Come on, let's move him.
Nice and slow.
Can you get up?
Thanks, guys.
Hey.
What's that smell?
Whoa!
Over there!
Oh shit!
I see you met our guard dogs.
Who was that?
Stay back.
Stay back!
You guys look like shit.
Come on, follow me.
Unless you want to
stay here with them.
What?
Come on, keep up.
Jorge here, wants to meet you.
Who's Jorge?
You'll see.
No one's come out
of the Scorch in a long time.
You just got him curious.
And me too.
I'm going to start to get
a bad feeling about this place.
Let's just hear him out.
See what he has to say.
Jorge, they are here.
Do you ever get the feeling
the whole world is against you?
3 questions:
Where did you come from?
Where're you going?
How can I profit?
Don't all answer at once.
We're heading for the mountains.
We are looking for Right Arm.
You're looking for ghost, you mean?
Question number 2.
Where did you come from?
That's our business.
Get the hell off me.
Get the hell off me, man.
Shut up, you big baby.
What is that?
You were right.
Right about what?
What is she talking about.
I'm sorry, hermano (brother).
Looks like you're tagged.
You came from WCKD.
Which means...
you're very valuable.
Great plan, Thomas.
"Just hear what the man has to say."
- Really working out for us.
- Oh. Shut up, Minho.
Maybe I can...
can reach the rope.
Enjoying the view?
What the hell do you want?
That is the question.
My men want to sell
you back to WCKD.
Life has taught them to think small.
I've never like that.
Something tells me you're not either.
Is it blood rushing through my head
or is the shake not making any sense?
Tell me what you know
about the Right Arm.
- I thought you said they were ghosts.
- I happen to believe in ghosts.
Especially when I hear them
chattering among the air waves.
You tell me what you know
and maybe we can make a deal.
Look, we...
we don't know much.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa.
Okay, okay, okay. Alright.
They're hiding in the mountains.
And they attack WCKD and
they got a bunch of kids.
That's it, that's all we know.
Jorge.
What's going on?
Me and my new friends,
we are just getting acquainted.
We're done now.
Hey, wait. What.
You're not going to help us?
Don't worry, hermano.
We will get you back
to where you belong.
Hang tight.
Going somewhere?
We both are.
Pack what you need.
Do it quietly.
Where exactly are we going?
It's real, Brenda.
These kids are our ticket.
We're right.
They can't turn us away.
Go now.
Okay.
I got it.
- Minho.
- Yeah.
- Minho, ready?
- Yeah.
Gotcha.
Okay.
1, 2, 3 and go.
- 3.
- 3.
- Not far enough.
- Shit!
I'm in position.
Send them in.
Come on, Minho.
Push her harder.
Shit.
This is it.
1, 2, 3.
- Yes! Yes!
- Okay.
Teresa, hurry!
So, what? You're just going to give it all up?
Everything you built.
There is no future here.
What happens when
another gang find this place?
And I lose control,
I can't protect you.
I don't need you to protect me.
What happens if you get the Flare?
What am I suppose to do then?
Chain you up, watch you turn?
Put a bullet in your head?
- Is that what you expect of me?
- I will do the same thing for you.
Good evening. This is the
World In Catastrophe: Killzone Department
We have your compound
completely surrounded.
You find yourselves,
with no fault of your own.
- The possession of WCKD property.
- Barkley.
Return them to us unharmed and we'll
consider this a simple misunderstanding.
Or you can resist,
and every last one of you,
will die.
It won't be long before the Flare
wash out the rest of us.
The hope for a cure
lies in your hands.
The choice is yours.
Go get the kids.
What're you going to do?
I'm going to play him
my favorite song.
Oh shit.
Let's go.
Let's go.
We're not trying to cause any trouble, okay.
We just, we got to gt out of here.
Is that so?
Janson, I got them for you.
I'm bringing them down.
Don't shoot us.
Come on.
Let's go.
I said, let's go
You little bastard.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on, let's go!
Barkley, what's your location?
Barkley, are you there?
Sir, do you hear this?
What is that?
Brenda!
Hurry, we don't have much time.
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go!
Right this way!
- Oh, you go to be kidding me.
- Plan B, hermano.
You kids want to get to the Right Arm.
I'll lead you to them.
But you got to owe me.
Follow me!
Alright!
Let's go!
- Come on!
- Go go go. Everyone go. GO.
Go!
- Come on. Come on.
- Come on.
All units, push in.
They're on the top floor!
Top floor!
Roger, move!
- Go!
- Go, Aris. Go.
Teresa, you're next.
Come on.
Brenda, where are you going?
You just go. Go go.
I'll be right behind you.
Hurry.
Alpha 22 in pursuit.
On the move!
Brenda, come on!
What are you doing?
We got to go!
- I got it. I got it.
- Come on! Come on!
Take cover!
Let's go.
Go! Go!.
Come on, hurry!
We're running out of time!
Here, follow me.
Come on!
Shit!
Whoa. We need them.
You go around, I'll go after them.
Over here.
Over here.
Kids, don't move!
Brenda, where are we going?
Hurry, the song's almost over!
Holy shit!
Come on!
Thomas!
Come on!
You okay?
Oh yeah, great.
No no no. How are we going
to get back to the others.
Relax. I'm going to
get us out of here.
Here.
Why are you helping us?
Trust me, it's not my idea.
Jorge seems to think you guys
are the ticket to the safe haven.
The what?
You know.
Paradise.
Safe from the sun,
free of infection.
Supposedly the Right Arm's been
taking kids there for years.
The immunes anyway.
And you know where that is?
No.
Jorge knows a guy, Marcus.
He used to...
He used to smuggle kids
up into the mountains.
If Jorge made it out,
that's where he'll be taking your friends.
- If he made it out?
- Hell, you ask a lot of questions.
Can you just, come over here
and help me with this?
Please.
That doesn't sound good.
Yeah.
Down here they'll be full turn.
Let's go.
I think it's this way.
You think?
Do people live down here?
The solar storms forced
people underground.
Jorge said there's settlements
all over these tunnels.
What about Jorge?
Is he your father?
Close enough.
Truth is, I really don’t know what he is,
he's just always been there.
And I always done what he asked me
to do, no matter how stupid.
So, you don't think
the Right Arm is real?
I think,
hope is a dangerous thing.
Hope has killed more of my friends
than the Flare and Scorch combine.
I decide Jorge was smarter than that.
Damn.
Hey, I think it might be this way.
Brenda?
Brenda?
Over here.
Look at this.
What?
What is it?
What the hell is this?
I don't know.
Jesus.
Go go go!
Look out.
Oh my god!
Come on!
Keep going!
We're almost there, come on!
Whoa!
Whoa whoa whoa.
Come on, this way!
Thomas!
Come on!
Okay,
- Go. Go.
- Come on!
Keep going.
Watch out!
Are you okay?
Come on!
Follow me.
Right behind you.
Go go go go.
Whoa whoa whoa!
- Okay. Go go.
- Come on!
Brenda!
Brenda!
You okay?
Yeah.
Alright. Hang on.
I'm going to find a way down.
Yo, Brenda.
Don't move. Don't move.
Come on. Come on.
Grab my hand.
No, no, no!
No, no...
Thomas!
I'm going to get to you.
- Brenda!
- I can't reach it!
Come on. Come on. Come on!
Brenda!
Got you.
We can get down here.
Come on.
Did you hear that?
You alright?
Shit.
Brenda.
Yeah, yeah.
I know.
Let's just go find Marcus.
Okay.
Try to blend in.
<font color="#ff8080">ZONE A</font>
Are you sure this is the place?
You here for the party?
Uh, no.
We are looking for Marcus.
This is his place, isn't it?
This is my place.
Are you Marcus?
Marcus doesn't live here anymore.
Do you know where
we can find him?
Sure. Sure.
He's over in Zone B.
- Alright. What's Zone B?
- That's where they burn the bodies.
Hey, look is. Has anyone else
been by here looking for him?
Group of kids around our age,
they have a girl with them. Dark hair.
You know what?
I think they might be inside.
Here.
Drink this.
What is it?
The price of admission.
Drink it!
Your turn.
Alright.
You 2 enjoy the party.
Maybe we should split up.
See if we can find the others?
Hey.
Don't drink anything else.
Life is fun!
Brenda?
They are not here.
Let's go.
We have to keep looking.
Why?
We couldn't find the
Right Arm anyway.
Not without Marcus.
Your friends are gone.
It's over.
It's just us now.
Just try and relax.
Let go.
How?
Like this.
What?
You're not her.
Brenda.
Brenda.
Thomas.
No!
Hey.
- Did anyone see you come here?
- No, what are you talking about?
- We don't have a lot of time.
- Thomas, what's wrong?
I just, I had to see you.
I'm just trying to explain
things before it...
Oh no!
- Thomas!
- Just listen to me, okay?
Whatever you tell them about me,
whatever you say.
I just need you to know,
I had to do, okay?
What did you do?
Because I can't keep
watching them die.
Over here.
- Come on.
- No!
I'm sorry.
Thomas!
Hey.
Hey, you're okay.
Hi.
We have to stop meeting like this.
Welcome back, you ugly shank.
I suggest that you talk,
you son of a bitch!
Damn it!
I'm sorry, you're going to
have to leave my house.
Looks like you've been having fun.
Listen.
I don't enjoy hurting you.
Okay?
Where is the Right Arm, Marcus?
Wait.
This is Marcus?
That kid catches on quick.
Hey. Are you the brains
of the operation?
I know,
you know where they are hiding.
So, you tell me
and I'll make you a deal.
- You could come with us.
- I burned that bridge a long time.
Besides, I make my own deal.
You're the one who taught me
never miss an opportunity.
What's he talking about?
I'm talking about supply and demand.
WCKD wants all the immunes
they can get.
I help provide that for them.
So, I lure the kids in...
they get drunk, they have a good time
and then later...
WCKD comes in
they separate the
wheat from the chaff.
- I change my mind, hermano.
- Oh. Oh.
I do enjoy hurting you.
Talk!
- Talk!
- Okay, okay, Jesus!
I'm not making any promises.
These guys like to move around.
They have an outpost in the mountains.
But it's a long way away.
You got half a WCKD on your ass,
you're never going to make it.
Not on foot.
Where's Berthe?
Not Berthe.
Well.
I guess we're on foot.
- Get down!
- Take cover!
Is everyone okay out there?
We're fine.
Anyone knows where the
bloody shots came from?
It's Marcus.
He led us into an ambush.
What do we do?
Here, hold this.
We got to create a diversion
You get ready to jock it.
Everybody! Get set
to sprint back to the truck.
And hold your ears.
Ready?
1.
2.
Drop it.
Now!
I said, drop it!
On you feet.
Let's go.
Let's go!
Move.
Back up!
Easy.
You need to
get over here now!
- Come on, let's go! On your feet!
- Do not be stupid, Move!
Slowly.
Aris?
- Oh my god. Harriet?
- Oh my god.
What the hell
are you doing here?
Sonia.
Aris, you're lucky we didn't
shoot your dump ass.
You alright there?
- How?
- Uh. What's happening?
We were in the Maze together.
We're clear, guys!
Come on out!
We're clear.
Get down!
My god, you're alive.
Back it up, Joe!
We're taking them to base.
Wait. So,
how did you guys get here?
- The Right Arm got us out.
- Wait, wait.
The Right Arm.
Do you know who they are?
Hop in.
I got this one.
They've been planning this
for over a year now.
This is all for us.
Guess you are lucky to
find us when you did.
We're moving out at first light.
- Where's Vince?
- Somewhere over there, I think.
Who's Vince?
He's the one who decides
if you get to stay.
I thought the Right Arm
was suppose to be an army.
Yeah, we were.
This is all what's left of us.
A lot of good people died
getting us this far.
Who are they?
They're immunes, caught them
coming up the mountain.
Did you check them?
I know this guy, Aris.
I trust him.
Alright, Tom.
Check them.
Hey, boss.
Brenda!
Brenda.
What's going on?
Brenda.
Brenda!
Brenda.
Branda, talk to me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- What happened?
- What's going on with her?
I don't know.
Brenda, are you alright?
- Brenda. Talk to me.
- What the hell.
Oh shit!
Crank. We got a crank.
- Stop!
- No no no... Wait wait wait...
- Step back! Step back!
- Just listen. Listen to me.
Okay, look. It's just happened, okay.
She's not dangerous yet.
- Well, you shouldn't have brought her here!
- I know, I...
If we let cranks in here now,
safe haven doesn't last a week.
- Let me go!
- Step back.
Alright, I understand.
Okay.
I understand, alright.
Just-Just listen to me, please.
Please, okay.
I told her you can help.
- Okay?
- No.
There's got to be something
you can do.
Yeah.
There is.
I can put her
out of her misery.
No.
No!
Vince!
That's enough.
Let him go.
Let him go!
She's infected, Doc.
There's nothing we can do for her.
No.
But he can.
Hello, Thomas.
What?
You know me?
Interesting.
Make sense they
put you in the Maze.
Although I must admit,
I was worried they'd kill you
after what you did.
What I did?
The first time we spoke, you said
you couldn't take it anymore.
Watching your friends die,
1 by 1.
The last time we spoke,
you give me the coordinates
of every WCKD compound,
trial and lab.
He was our source.
We couldn't have pulled
all this off without him.
Take her to the tent.
Get these guys some warm clothes.
- Careful.
- I'm on it.
It's the least we can do.
Thomas, come on.
We need to get
some blood from you.
In the beginning,
we were lost.
All we knew for sure,
was that the younger you were,
the stronger your chances.
You work for WCKD?
Long time ago.
You know at first,
we had the best intentions.
To find a cure,
save the world.
It was clear you kids
were the key...
because you're immune.
But why?
Eventually, they found an answer.
An enzyme produced by the brain
could be immune.
once separated from bloodstream
it can serve as a powerful agent
to slow the spread
of the virus.
So you found a cure.
Not exactly.
The enzymes can't be manufactured,
only harvested from the immune.
The young.
Of course that didn't stop WCKD.
If they had their way,
they sacrificed an entire generation.
All for this.
A gift biology of evolution.
But, one meant
not for all of us.
How long will that give her?
It's different for everyone,
a few months maybe.
But, that's the catch, isn't it.
She will always need more.
Okay.
Let's...
Let's go outside.
Let her rest.
Let's go.
She'll be fine.
Thomas.
You know she can't
come with us, right?
He was my brother.
Sorry. Are you okay?
How are you feeling?
You remind me of him.
He always saw
the best in people.
Where is he now?
I don't know.
When we were kids...
we were taken in by
one of WCKD's camps.
They gave us a bunch of tests.
They didn't want me.
They wanted him though.
They didn't even
let me say goodbye.
What was his name?
George.
That was Chuck.
How did he die?
Saving my life.
- If anything were to happen to her, I...
- I know. I know.
You get in there,
go talk to her.
I guess I owe you now.
I wish Al could've
to seen all this.
And Winston.
And Chuck.
They will be proud of you,
you know, Tommy.
Yeah.
Hey, Aris!
Hey, guys!
I kinda like that kid.
Yeah.
I still don't trust him though.
Hey, where's Teresa?
She went up there.
Hey.
You okay?
What're you doing up here?
Just thinking.
I'll let you be alone.
Do you remember your mother?
I think so.
I remember my.
She was a beautiful woman.
Everybody loved her.
Before WCKD she was all I had.
When she got sick,
I didn't know what to do.
I just kept her locked up, hidden.
I thought she would get better.
Every night, she made this awful
sounds like... screaming.
And then one night,
she just stopped.
It's finally quiet.
I went down to her room.
There was blood everywhere.
But she was just sat there, calm.
She said she was feeling better.
My visions were calm,
she had taken care of them.
She took her eyes out, Thomas.
There are millions of people
suffering out there.
Millions of stories just like myself.
We can't turn our backs on them.
I won't.
Wha-What are you saying?
I'm saying,
I want you to understand.
Understand what?
Why I did it.
Teresa.
Please don't fight them, Thomas.
What have you done?
What have you done?
NOOOOO!!!
Alright drop in, boys.
Round them up.
Go!
Get out!
Take them out!
Get up!
Don't move!
Where's Thomas?
Hurry!
Ammo!
You need to cover us!
Ammo!
Hey!
You know how to use this thing?
Cover me!
This could be our only chance!
Brenda!
You dumb ass.
What, you trying to
get yourself killed?
We have to go, now,
while we still have the chance.
- I got to go find the others.
- No! No, look out there!
Look.
You can't help them.
Vince, hurry up.
There're too many of them.
I'm out!
Look out!
SHIT!
Alright, take me down.
I'm sorry.
There is nothing you can do
for them, If we don't move now
we won't be much better off.
- You guys got to go right now.
- What?
They are not looking for you.
You'll be safe but you
should have to go. Now.
Thomas.
I can't leave without them.
Good luck, kid.
Brenda, we have to go.
Come on.
Come on!
Let's go.
Come on. Come on!
- You okay?
- Yeah.
B-4.
- How many did we get?
- All of them, give or take.
- Give or take what?
- Well, they lost a few.
A-4.
A-6.
B-3.
- Where is Thomas?
- I'm right here.
Let's go!
Thomas.
Thomas.
Get him in line.
Okay.
Bring her in.
Why didn't you run?
I'm tired of running.
- Is this all of them?
- Most of them.
It'll be enough.
- Start loading them in.
- Yes, ma'am.
Okay, you heard!
Let's go, get them on!
Hello, Thomas.
I'm glad you're safe.
- What the hell?
- Teresa.
Wait, what's going on?
She's with them.
Since when?
Oh, Teresa always has an amount of
appreciation of the greater good.
Once we restored her memories,
it's only a matter of time.
I'm sorry.
I had no choices.
This is the only way.
We have to find a cure.
She's right.
This is all just a means to an end.
You used to understand that, Thomas.
No matter what you think of me
I'm not a monster,
I'm a doctor.
I sworn an oath to find a cure.
No matter the cause.
I just need more time.
More blood.
Hello, Mary.
I'd hoped we meet again.
I'm sorry it had to be
under these circumstances.
I'm sorry about
a lot of things too.
But not this.
At least my conscience is clear.
So is my.
Mary.
Mary.
Mary!
Mary!
Mary!
Get off me!
Mary.
Mary.
Mary.
Mary!
NOOOO!
MARY!
No.
Come on, Janson.
Load them up, let's go.
All this people.
Get rid of them.
Let's go.
Let's go!
- Let go of me!
- Sonia! Aris!
Get back! Now!
Everyone stand back!
- Back! Everyone stand back!
- Hold your fire!
- Everyone stand back!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.
- Stay back. Let them go.
- Thomas, put it down.
- Let them all go!
- You know I can't do that.
Thomas, please stop.
I made a deal with them.
They promised. They promised
we'll be safe, all of us.
Okay. I'm suppose-I'm suppose
to trust you now?
It's true.
It was her only condition.
Shut up!
Everything can go back
to the way it was.
Thomas. Do you really
want all of them to die?
Listen to her, Thomas.
Think about what you're doing.
We're with you, Thomas.
No.
Don't.
Do it, Thomas.
We are ready.
- Not going back there.
- Thomas.
It's the only way.
Thomas!
We got to move!
Let's run!
- Get her out of here!
- Come on!
You good?
Freeze!
Drop it, kid.
- Run!
- Run, get down!
Freeze!
What a waste.
Ow!
Vince, go!
Get down!
AAhhhh!
I got you.
I got you.
Get out of here! Go!
Go!
Come on, Thomas.
Get out of here.
- Let's go!
- Get out of here, go!
Get down.
Minho!
Minho!
Minho!
Minho!
Thomas!
No!
Minho!
Go! Come on!
Come on!
Minho.
Come on.
What do we do now?
Now we pick up
what's left of us,
we stick to the plan and
get you kids to the safe haven.
And we start over, I guess.
I'm not going with you.
What?
I made a promise to Minho.
I wouldn't leave him behind
and I have to go after him.
Hey, kid.
Look around you, alright.
WCKD just kicked our ass.
You think about
where you're headed?
I'm not asking anyone
to come with me.
Thomas, listen to me.
I've known Minho for...
for as long as I can remember.
So, If there's anyway...
we can help him. Trust me.
I will be up there
standing next to you.
This,
what you're talking about...
is impossible.
More like suicide.
Maybe.
But I know what
I'm suppose to do now.
It's no just about Minho.
It's about all of us.
It's about everyone WCKD's ever
taken, everyone they will take.
They'll never stop.
They'll never stop.
So, I'm going to stop them.
I'm going to kill that bitch.
I have to admit.
I like some revenge.
Well, that's a good speech, kid.
So what's your plan?
