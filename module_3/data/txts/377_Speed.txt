Thank you.
Taxi!
Yes dad, Sandy speaking!
This is my local number please
feed it in your mobile.
No need son, the next time
I will hear your voice..
..only when you will succeed
in your plans.
I will succeed dad, after
all whose son am I?
No matter how angry she is.
When she will see
me here in London..
..she will forget the past.
All the best son.
- Thanks dad.
You are an Indian, Sandy sir.
- Yes.
Sandeep Malhotra.
I am Iqbal Quershi, from Pakistan.
Seems like it is a matter of love.
- Yes.
You love her a lot.
But regretfully, I understood
that after she went away.
But the reasons to be angry
with a person like you?
It is a sonnet from your side.
What's the line?
"The people from the city was
crazy, I was a bit insane too."
"I made some mistake, and
some the world made me do."
Sid.
- Yeah!
Which jacket do you want darling?
- The black one.
They are all black.
Then the best one.
Bobby, it is 8:30 you
are still brushing.
Come on hurry up baby, come on!
Breakfast is ready guys!
You know Richa, I am sure
I am the world's only man..
..who cooks breakfast in the
morning for his wife and child. - Oh!
If I knew I would have to
do this after marriage..
..then I would have never
become a chef, right?
Baby, if I had known that I will
marry a professional chef..
..then I would have
never learnt to cook.
Some peanut butter?
I want to talk to you both
about something important.
Yes?
- I think I am going to get married.
What?
With whom?
- She studies in my class.
She is very beautiful, mom.
I think I have found my soul mate.
Soul mate?
Do you know the meaning
of soul mate, son? - No.
Then where did you hear
this word from son?
From papa.
Papa was saying soul mate
to someone on the phone.
Bobby, let us go to school.
We are getting late.
We will have breakfast
on the way, okay.
Let's go, let's go.
You wicked boy.
Sid, one minute.
Baby, don't forget football
practice. - Okay, Mom.
Just a minute darling.
What is all this?
What?
Who is your soul mate?
Richa, I was really going
to tell you everything..
What were you going to say?
I can't look at you
and say all this.
That's why I have written
everything down..
..and kept it in the microwave.
But please, read it after I leave.
Bye.
Okay, here we are.
You trapped me today, naughty boy.
Sorry.
Bye.
- Bye. Good day.
Yeah!
So, what do we do now?
Hello!
You take care of this, I will
take care of the rest.
Hi!
Hello gorgeous!
Hello my cookie jar!
There you are! There you are!
O God!
How did you know I was here?
Lovers know each others
credit card numbers too.
And your credit card numbers
and shopping habit..
..brought me here, my sweet pea.
Oh no! - One moment, one moment,
no fighting, no argument..
..no nothing. I have talked
to your mama and papa.
As soon as we leave from here..
..we will get married grandly,
my cutie pie.
Marriage?
- Yeah!
How can you even think of that?
But I have already thought of it.
What are you? A spoilt
son of a rich father..
..who has still not grown up.
Who has no sense of responsibility!
What do you think,
marriage is a game?
For that..
- You have to grow up, isn't it?
I know.
Look, what I have written
for you 1000 times.
I will never be childish again.
"Don't be upset with
me, my darling."
"Please listen to me, beloved.
Please listen to me."
"I know I have made a mistake."
"But this heart belongs to you."
"Please don't torment it anymore."
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."
"Right now! Right now!"
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."
"Some how! Some how!"
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."
"Right now! Right now!"
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."
"Some how! Some how!"
"Don't create a scene."
"Have some shame."
"People will laugh at us."
"Think about it"
"There is time, think about it."
"You..
- Don't say anything."
"You..
- Stay away."
"You..
- Enough, come on."
"The nights are beautiful
because of you."
"It's a night filled with stars."
"It is such a beautiful
night, come on now."
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."
"Right now! Right now!"
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."
"Some how! Some how!"
"How can I trust you?"
"Who knows what's true
and what's not."
"The stars and the moon
may speak for you."
"But still the heart doesn't agree."
"Heart..
- Don't say anything."
"Heart..
- Stay away."
"Heart..
- Enough, come on."
"The heart trusts me, then
why are you refusing."
"I am where you are, my darling."
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."
"Right now! Right now!"
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."
"Some how! Some how!"
"I want to, want to take
you home with me."
"Right now! Right now!"
"I am going to, going to
take you home with me."
"Some how! Some how!"
Keys in there.
Good morning!
- Good morning Sasha!
Good morning!
- Morning!
Morning boss!
- Morning!
No gum today?
No, I didn't take underground
today. Came by the bus.
Hurry up, the grand
boss has called you.
Pam, why do you call
him the grand boss?
What else should I call him? You
are my boss, and he is your boss.
So he is the grand boss.
But if you see his temper today..
..you will call him grand boss too.
Why, what's the matter? - Seems
like you will be promoted today?
Really? - If grand asks for someone
10 times within half an hour..
..then think it is time of trial.
Seems like grand boss
is going to send you..
..on a big mission, if you get
success in such a mission then..
Boss, all the best.
Morning James.
- Morning Sid, bad times.
Here.
- What's in it?
A few days back, our covert
MI6 agent from Malaysia..
..Kuala Lumpur, sent us
this code in his e-mail.
He didn't understand the sender.
He didn't understand the code..
..but it came as a red signal alert.
An SOS channel, Sid, you know what
that means? An eminent danger.
Danger to whom?
- To us.
It was sent to our agent.
MI6 thinks there is a possibility
of a terrorist attack in London.
I sent the message to the Mossad,
Russian intelligence..
..ISI and FBI, but I want MI5 to
be the agent to crack this code.
Yes, yes I can understand.
You have just shifted.
It will take sometime
to settle down.
I will get your son admitted
in my school.
No, Mrs. Mehra, I am
a science teacher.
Yes.
I will try to take some time out.
Siddharth stays busy.
You.. hello!
Peek-a-boo!
5400766600..
..EQUINOXA.
Is this a code or a book?
Come on, Pam! We have to crack this!
MI6 says that there might be some
terrorist attack on London.
We have to stop it!
Why are you doing this
to me? Who are you?
And what do you want from me?
Look, you might not be knowing but
I am a British citizen! Okay!
My one complain and your..
Equinox A! Equinox A! Equinox A!
That's right! Equinox!
Equinox A!
- Equinox is the day which comes..
..in the middle of summers
and winters.
Equinox!
It's just till the evening.
As soon as the night falls..
your life will become bright.
I promise. We will release you.
But till then.. if you scream..
then before the night falls..
..I will have to kill you!
Look.. you people are mistaken!
You people won't benefit anything
by kidnapping me!
I am a school teacher!
I don't have any money
to give to you all!
I have loads of money!
But not a husband like Siddharth!
He too can't do anything! He
is a chef in a restaurant!
Equinox!
Meaning when day and
night are equal.
That's right! - And it happens
only twice in a year!
23rd March and 22nd September!
23rd March spring! And autumn!
A is for autumn!
Equinox A! - Meaning 22nd
September! - That's right!
Something is going to happen
on 22nd September, Pam!
Boss.. boss! Today
is 22nd September!
Oh my God!
Your husband is an MI5 agent!
He works for the most
secretive agency here!
What?!
Now I understood! Look!
You people have abducted me
mistaking some other Siddharth.
It's a.. it's a case of
mistaken identity! Okay!
Look! Look! His name
is Siddharth Verma!
And my name is Richa! Richa Verma!
And all this.. that you
are doing, its wrong! I..
This time I have disconnected
the phone!
Next time it will be your voice!
Hey, Sid! Someone must
have been in your car!
Your alarm has gone off!
What crap! Coming! Just work
on this! I will just come!
Yeah! - I will be right
back! - Yeah! Okay!
Hello!
- You have stopped this alarm!
But the alarm of your death..
only I can stop that!
Who are you?
Relax, captain! Relax! I am not
an enemy! I am your friend!
Mr. Siddharth Verma! Head
of co-ed operation.
MI5. England.
Open your car's trunk!
You scoundrel! How dare you!
You don't know what I can do!
I know, that why
I have chosen you!
The work which we want to do..
only you can do it.
What do you want?
- Relax, captain! Relax!
I am there! I will
explain everything!
The dustbin is in front.
Go towards it!
Break the CD and throw
it in the dustbin!
Bad! Bad! Very bad!
I said to break the CD and throw it!
Very good!
Now sit in the car! And head
towards Kensington Road!
Let me go!
Open it! Damn it!
For God's sake! Listen to me!
Sanjana! My sweet pea! My honey bun!
Where are you going?
Hang on! Oh God!
Dial tone!
- Sandeep, please!
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!
Listen to me for the last time!
After that if you want, then
you can shut this door..
..on my face forever!
Come on!
Tell me!
- Accept my gift! - Gift?
Yeah! Because I know that
seeing this gift..
..your anger will abate!
And you will come
running in my arms!
Impossible!
Very possible, sweetie!
Sandy, what are you doing?
- Very possible!
Now just stay put!
Come on! Come on!
What are you doing?
I am increasing the suspense,
darling!
Just wait here for me! I will
be back in a jiffy! Okay!
So all the problems are solved!
1234..
569..
3456789..
Yeah!
Hello! Pathara restaurant!
Pathara what?
I am trying to reach Siddharth
Verma! Please help me!
No! I am not a chef! I am a
computer engineer! So bye-bye!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please! Please!
I need your help!
My help? Didn't you find anybody
else in the morning?
Please, ma'am! Please! Goodbye!
Wrong number!
Hello! Please don't disconnect!
You.. you are an Indian!
- So?
Look, please.. I am
in grave trouble!
Right now my problem
is graver than yours!
In fact my girlfriend
got angry with me!
And leaving your and my India,
she has come here!
Please disconnect!
So that I can entice her and
take her back to India!
No, no, no! Please
try to understand!
Somebody has kidnapped me!
Kidnapped you? This is a good one!
And after kidnapping you
they gave you the phone!
And said you can call all
the Indians for help!
Okay! Very nice! But I don't
have time to waste!
Okay! Thank you very much!
Please! Please don't disconnect!
Please!
Look.. they have broken the phone.
With great difficulty I
have joined the wires..
..and dialled this number.
If the phone got disconnected
then maybe again..
You want to talk to your wife,
don't you? Talk to her! -Sid!
Siddharth!
- Richa! Richa, are you okay?
Siddharth, look they have
brought me here by mistake!
And they are saying that
you work for MI5!
Sid, tell them that you are
a chef in a restaurant!
Richa, do you know any of them?
Obviously not, Sid!
And we don't have anything
to do with all this!
You.. why don't you say.. what
they are saying about you..
..its all wrong..
I mean..
- I will explain all that later!
Right now listen to me carefully!
Carefully observe everything
around you, inside and out!
And tell me whatever you see!
I want to know where
they have hidden you!
Old buildings! Stable like place!
There is no building around!
There is a lake nearby..
..and mountains behind..
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
- Relax, captain! Relax!
You have spoken to your wife!
But the next time if you
tried to be smart..
..then it will be your
last conversation.
Now turn the car towards your bank.
You are going to regret
this! -Don't talk!
Just listen!
You will receive the rest
of the instructions..
..on reaching Barclays bank.
Oh no!
Hello!
I heard everything. I believe you.
What do you want me to do?
Police station! Please go
to the police station!
And let me talk to some
police officer.
And listen don't let this call
get disconnected. Okay?
Okay.
Good that I was there, Mr. Sandy.
But the matter reached
to the police station!
Iqbal, hurry up! Please!
By the way.. what's your name?
Richa! Richa Verma! I am a science
teacher in St. Joseph.
Okay! I am Sandy! Sandeep!
Just a second.
Oh no!
Hi, sweetie! What are you doing?
Shut up! Where are you?
Here only?
- Where?
In the cab!
- In the cab?
I will be there within half and
hour and tell you everything!
Half and hour?!
You said two minutes and you have
vanished for half an hour!
Now you are saying half an hour!
So maybe now you won't come!
Yes! I was coming to you!
But Richa interrupted..
Richa! Who is Richa?
I will come and explain
everything, doll!
Whether you meet Richa or Ayesha!
I don't have anything
to do with you!
I should have understood
before only..
..that you haven't come
to London for me!
I am leaving the hotel!
- But where?
I won't make the mistake
of telling you that!
But listen to me!
- Bye!
Bye!
Oh no! Hello, Richa!
Hello. Yeah! I am waiting!
Don't worry! I am on my way!
Okay!
No! Listen.. listen..
You have to understand. This is my..
Hello!
- Go to the cash counter.
Come on! Move!
There is a queue!
You are MI5 agent! Who can stop you?
I am just a chef! Nobody knows me!
We will have to wait!
But I want my money now!
I have told you, sir!
We can't get it today!
This cheque is for
23rd of September!
And today is the 22nd!
This is my employment cheque!
I don't have any money!
Sorry, sir! We can't do anything!
Go to hell!
What does she thinks of herself!
Morning!
- Good morning!
Would you like to make a100 pounds?
What?
Have you reached? -Yeah, Richa!
I am just entering the
police station now!
Hang on! Excuse me!
Excuse me! I need to speak
to somebody in charge!
Inside please!
Excuse me, officer!
I am here to help this lady!
She has been kidnapped!
Excuse me! Can I disturb
you for a minute?
If you are not too busy!
Kidnapped? How do you know her?
Actually I don't. But I do.
I just got to know her.
But how do you know
about the kidnapping?
Good question!
She told me. She is on this phone.
Please talk to her!
We have waged a bet!
Monica says that you are enough.
And I think that just you won't do.
Why didn't she call us
and she called you?
It's complicated! Why don't
you just talk to her?
Hello!
He says that just you are not
enough to scare your husband.
Hello!
And I say that what we want him
to do.. he will do it so easily..
..that for that your son..
What's his name? Yes! Bobby!
What's the need of bringing
Bobby here?
No!
Hello! Hello!
There is nobody!
- Just leave him alone! Okay!
Officer! I am sure she is there!
Her name is Richa Verma!
Richa Verma! Please don't be
afraid! This is a police officer!
Hello! Please speak up!
Poor Bobby.. must be tense alone.
Mummy is here!
Papa is running about for our work!
Who will look after him?
I will do one thing! I will
bring him here from school.
You can help him in
his homework here.
And we will get our work
done by your husband.
Please don't drag my
son in this! Please!
Sorry! For disturbing you!
Please!
Are you trying to fool me?
No, no, officer! I promise she
was on this line! Just..
Take this phone and get lost!
Hello! Richa!
I said get out!
Isn't it your responsibility
to help people?
I mean aren't you guys the police?
You guys! You guys are
making a mistake!
I swear! My sweet girlfriend! She
was on that line! -Come on! Let's go!
Hello! Hello!
We don't want to see
you again! Okay!
Mr. Sandeep!
Now where do you want to go?
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!
Thank you! Thank God! You spoke!
I am sorry, Sandy!
What sorry? Because of you I have..
..angered my girlfriend
and come here!
And you didn't even
talk to the police!
For the first time I
have been kicked out!
Sandy, they had come in the room.
I couldn't talk in front of them.
Sandy! I am sorry! Please
try to understand!
Now what do you want?
- My child..
Sandy, my child!
- Child!
Now from has this child come?
They are going to kidnap
him from his school!
Sandy, my child..
Go to the police!
The police won't believe me!
Just 2 minutes ago I was talking
about saving a woman!
If I said anything about saving a
child.. then they will lock me up..
..thinking I am insane!
So you go to the school!
- Me?
Yes! Reach there before
them and pick up Bobby!
Please, Sandy! Don't think!
For Christ's sake!
The school will get over
after half an hour!
Don't let them get hold of
my child! Sandy, please!
Where is the school?
Delwar school! Delvich!
Bobby studies in class G2!
And yes.. he has a red
colour Spiderman bag!
Please, Sandy! Go there quickly!
They are very dangerous people!
If they got hold of Bobby, then I..
Fine! I will try! But
please don't cry!
Iqbal! Let's go!
Hello!
- Boss..
..where are you? You
just disappeared!
I even called at your home!
It's not reachable!
Pam, somebody has kidnapped Richa!
What! - I think it's connected
to that code!
But boss, we have still
not cracked that code!
Listen, you don't worry.
I will talk to chief.
We will not let anything
happen to Richa! Okay!
No! Don't do that!
Till the time I don't finish
this kidnapper's task..
..he won't harm her.
What does he want?
- I don't know!
I just know that he is doing..
..all this with complete planning!
He has an eye on my each movement!
Right now if I involved MI5..
..then Richa's life can
be really in danger.
Okay! Okay! What do
you want me to do?
Just try to crack the
code immediately!
I am going to Bobby's school.
They might go there.
How far away are you
from the school?
Around.. Iqbal, how much
time will it take?
Sandeep, there will be heavy
traffic in city centre.
It will take 25 minutes.
25 minutes!
- Oh no! ..
The school will close
after 15 minutes.
What if they reached
there before you?
So what can I do in this, Richa?
Hang on! I will do something!
Sanjana, where are you, darling?
I have kept your luggage
in the room!
And I am going to keep
my luggage in the cab!
Very good! Very good! Come in a cab!
Take a cab and quickly
reach Delwar school!
What! - Yes! It's around 10
minutes away from there!
I am not going anywhere!
My dear, go quickly! The child's
life is in danger!
Child? Whose child?
Richa's child!
Oh! Now Richa has a child too!
What else are you hiding from me?
I will come and explain
everything, Richa!
I mean, Sanjana! Please
help me, darling!
Look, the child's name is Bobby!
He studies in class 2G! - And he
has a red colour Spiderman bag.
Okay! Please..
- Go to hell!
Iqbal.. I think we will
have to do something.
Richa, don't worry. We will get
there as soon as possible.
Sandy.. what's her name?
Sanjana.
I have put you into trouble, right?
But your trouble is
bigger than mine.
Don't worry. I will get there
as soon as possible.
Excuse me!
- Yes!
I need a cab!
- Where would you like to go?
The Highpark Hotel. -Yeah!
That's fine! Just give me
2 minutes please! - Okay!
Yes, sir! We can have
a driver at 3 p.m.
If that's okay with you.
Actually I would like to go
to Delwar school please!
The road is blocked!
Oh no! Any other way?
There is. But we will have
to take a longer route.
Yes! There is a shortcut!
If you ran, you will reach
there within 5 minutes.
Fine, Iqbal. You bring the cab to
the school. I will meet you there.
Right, sir!
What's going on, Sandy?
The road is blocked ahead, Richa!
I will try to run to the school!
Oh my God!
Yes! Pray that I reach
there before them!
Hurry up! Hurry up, Sandy!
Please hurry up!
Excuse me. Which way to G2?
It's that way! On the left!
- Thank you!
Leave me!
Leave me!
- Richa, I found him! - Leave me!
I am your new friend!
Talk to your mother!
Hello!
- Hello, Bobby!
Are you okay, son?
Yes, I am okay, mom!
Okay! Listen to me carefully! Okay!
Today mama has to go out for
some very urgent work.
So mama can't come to pick you
up. Stay with uncle. Okay.
Yes, mama. I will stay with him.
What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
I have come to pick up the child!
-When you could come, ..
..then why did you call me?
I couldn't have managed.
But I have come.
What you can't do, you do that!
And what you should do,
you can't do that!
Sanjana, you just listen
to me for a second.
Dear, give me a second.
Look.. I was 25 minutes
away from here.
And you were 10 minutes away.
Obviously you would have
reached before me.
And obviously.. - I will come
to pick you up by night. Okay.
Sunshine, please listen to me!
I love you, Bobby!
I have reformed! I have reformed!
I have reformed!
I have completely reformed,
my apple pie!
Now know one thing.
No matter what happens.. henceforth
I won't leave you.
Not even for another woman's child?
Who woman? Who..
Hello! Hello! Hello!
Hello, Bobby! Bobby!
Sandy! Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Sandy! Sandy!
Sandy, where are you going?
- Hello! Hello! ..
..Hello, Richa!
- Where is Bobby?
Sorry! Sorry! There was a blunder!
But I am following them!
But where is he?
- They are taking him in the car!
Taking him! So what are you doing?
How did they take him
when you were there?
Why didn't you stop them?
What is going on?
Hey! Hey! You! Hey you! Scoundrel!
Hell!
Hello!
Richa! Richa! Hey you!
You must have heard
your wife's screams!
You people said you won't touch her!
We also said that you
won't betray us!
Within 10 minutes if you
didn't reach the bank..
..or if you tried to act smart..
I will shoot her.
Hello! Oh no!
Hey!
Knight bridge.
- Out of the question!
It's an emergency! My wife's
life is in danger!
I have to reach to the bank!
Please! -So go to the hospital!
Why do you want to the bank? - Why
do you want to know? You drive!
You don't understand!
The meter is down!
I am waiting for the passenger!
The fare is to be taken!
I will pay for it! Get in!
Every Indian is in a hurry!
Hello! Where are you? God damn it!
Hello!
- Hello!
Hello! Richa!
- Yes!
Richa, no need to worry! They
are right in front of me!
Don't lose Bobby, Sandy!
Don't lose him!
Richa.. they are passing
the Parliament house!
I am right behind them.
I have an idea! Look..
there might be..
..a car phone in the car
which you are driving.
Just check it.
Without disconnecting this call..
..you can talk to the police
using that phone.
Hurry up!
- Car phone! Car phone!
Radio! Radio!
Wow! Pretty girl!
- What?
Sorry! Sorry!
I couldn't find a car phone!
O Sandy.. you just follow Bobby!
Oh no! Richa, you are not
going to believe this!
But my phone's battery is going off!
Do something, Sandy!
If this call got disconnected then
I won't be able to dial again!
So you tell me what to do, Richa!
I can either stop the car
and charge the phone!
Or I can follow them!
What do you want?
You follow Bobby!
Damn it!
- What happened?
Richa, there is no petrol
in the car! - What!
Do something, Sandy! Do something!
Relax!
- Hello, Sandy! - I'll try my best.
Okay! Just hang in there!
Hello! Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
- Hello!
Hello! What's happening?
- Just hang on!
Richa, I have lost them!
I have lost them!
Richa!
Morning, sir!
Morning! Morning!
I got your leave application
this morning!
I am pleased to inform you!
- Thank you, sir!
That your leave is cancelled.
What! Sir, you can't do this!
I can do anything I want!
- But sir..
Well unfortunately you chose the
wrong day to ask for the leave.
Because today is the day
we need you the most.
The Indian Prime Minister
is coming to London.
And the Indian delegation
requested that..
..an Indian officer takes
charge of the security.
They have even recommended
your name.
But sir, I..
- No ifs and buts..
Orders are orders!
Yeah! Yeah!
Good morning, ma'am! It's a
pleasure to meet the Prime Minister.
We are happy to receive you.
- Thank you.
So you are an Indian?
- Yes, sir.
Why.. why do the authorities
here think that..
..that we don't know
how to speak English?
That's not true, sir!
Then why have they appointed
you for madam's security?
So that you people feel
more comfortable.
By the way English officers can..
..kill anybody to save madam's life.
But an Indian officer can even lay
down his life if the need arises.
What's your name?
Rohan, ma'am! Rohan Nath!
Here! We have reached Knight Bridge!
Here! For him and me!
- Thank you!
Thank you!
- Listen! Mister!
What happened?
I hope that your wife..
- Fine!
Go to the cash counter.
And withdraw 50,000 pounds
from your account.
What! 50,000 pounds!
I think you have not done
complete research on me!
I don't have that kind of money!
Go to the counter, Sid! And
inquire about the balance.
Yeah! You want to hear
about it? Hang on!
Excuse me. Hi. My name
is Siddharth Verma.
I would like to know
my balance please.
What is your account number?
0191.. 0000.. 52!
Mr. Siddharth Verma!
- Yes!
Your account is 1.5 million pounds.
What!
And your request to withdraw
50000 pounds..
..has already been processed.
Just take this.
And sign here.
What are you thinking, Sid?
Sign and take the money.
What the hell is going on?
How come there is so much
money in my account?
The one whom we are happy with..
we make him happy.
Now quickly take the money
and reach Windsor Castle!
There is a phone booth
near the castle.
You have to leave the money there.
So you can download ring tone..
..from the internet or with
a Bluetooth you can..
Excuse me, sir.
- Yes.
I need a car charger for this
phone! It's really urgent!
There is a queue!
I have to..
- This is really..
I'm sorry..
- My battery is dying, mister!
I said I am sorry! Go to the
end of the line! Please!
I need a car charger!
Take it easy, man! Take it easy!
I need a car charger!
How much?
It's okay! It's on the house!
How.. much?
6.. 50!
I will give you the change.
Keep.. the change.
Thanks!
Keep the gun too!
Mama, please don't stand
near the window.
It can be dangerous, mama!
Don't worry! It's bullet proof.
Besides this, ma'am can
look out of the window.
But nobody can see
ma'am from outside.
You have organised a tight
security for me.
We have to do it, ma'am.
It's our duty and you
are our guest too.
Guest? You live in England.
But your culture is Indian.
Leave me! Leave me!
Take me to my mama!
Leave me!
I am not your uncle or mummy
or daddy's friend.
I am a bad man. Really bad.
If you screamed again..
then I will behead you..
..and hang your head
in front of the car.
Okay.
Excuse me! Follow the car!
- Which car?
That car!
- Okay!
Hello! Pick up the phone, Richa!
Hello! Hello! Hello, Richa! Hello!
Hello, Richa! Richa!
Hello! Richa! Pick up the phone!
Hello!
- Hello!
Richa! Good news! I got
the phone charger!
But there is one problem.
There is no car.
Just find a car and charge the
phone, Sandy. Hurry up. Please!
Found it!
Excuse me. Look, I have a very
tragic, tragic problem.
And I need your help.
What?
Until yesterday I had only
one problem. No girlfriend.
Now girlfriend. But
miscommunication.
Then communication.
But cross connection!
That woman, no husband, no child!
Then child, but girlfriend!
Then no girlfriend, no child!
Then car, but no petrol.
Then no car, but phone.
Now phone, but no batteries.
Then charger, but no car.
Now phone and charger but still no..
You get it?
No?
No?
Can you just move to the
side a second? Yes.
Hang on! I will explain.
Now car.. phone.. charger.
And woman on the phone.
And you outside. Get it?
Okay! Bye!
But it's not my car!
Hi, Pam.
- Yeah, boss!
Pam, they have kidnapped Bobby.
O God!
They want me to do some big job..
..and then they will
put the blame on me.
1.5 million has been transferred
in my account.
Do you want me to trace the funds?
No point. Must be from
a numbered account.
Boss, please! Please let me
speak to the chief this time!
Without MI5 you can't
do anything, boss!
And what is the guarantee that
after getting their work done..
..they will release Richa and Bobby?
They..
Nothing will happen to them!
Just give me sometime!
If I can't do anything then I
will myself talk to the chief.
For the moment try to crack
the code as soon as possible.
Okay.
- Just a minute.
As such I am working on the
beginning and end of the code.
But its middle digits.
I have understood the meaning.
- What is it?
It's 66600. Three times
6 meaning 1800.
1800 hours.
If this code is linked
to those people then..
..they will surely do something
this evening at 6 o'clock.
Please, Sameera! Please!
Try to understand!
I am not lying to you! No!
I can't tell you!
It's for security reasons!
I cannot tell you!
Please! Stop, baby! Stop!
It's not a girl. It's a woman.
It is not what you are thinking!
Sam.. Sameera, please! Sameera,
listen to me now!
No! Don't hang up!
Excuse me!
- Yes!
Ma'am is calling you!
I will call you back!
Yes, ma'am!
With whom were you talking?
Sorry to have disturbed you, ma'am!
With whom were you talking?
Girlfriend! Today is her birthday!
I was explaining to her
that I can't come today.
Call her here!
What?
- I said call her here!
Leave me! Leave me!
Leave me!
Mama!
Mama! I want to go home!
I want mama!
Sandy!
Sandy, they have come
here with Bobby!
They have brought Bobby here!
Oh my God!
Don't worry, Richa! I won't let
anything happen to you people!
Okay!
Rohan, if this is going to
be one of your surprises..
..I am going to be really,
really mad!
I told you that I am going
to be! You don't..
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
I can't believe this! Gayatri Devi!
I am so sorry!
So you are Sam! Sameera!
No! Yes!
Do you know.. why I
have called you here?
To scold me! I know you
are upset! It's my fault!
You wanted to know who is the girl
who calls again and again..
..and troubles the head
of security! No!
I wanted to see.. who is that
girl whom Rohan loves so much!
I don't need you before 6 o'clock!
Before the conference begins..
I am here in my room.
And as it is you have posted
security guards outside.
So leave.
But ma'am.. -Rohan! That's an order!
No problem! No problem at all!
No problem whatsoever!
See you!
Mister Verma! You can
give that money to me!
Thank you!
Thank you very much!
Okay! I have got the money with me!
Good! We will meet you at
the dock at exactly 6:30!
Okay! - Put the passage on the
liner! And keep everything ready!
Yes, ma'am!
Tell me! What you have
done for us till now..
..thanks a lot, Mr. Siddharth Verma!
Thank you very, very much!
And we have not harmed
Richa and Bobby!
They haven't been hurt at all!
Now what do you want?
What do you want?
Nothing! Now we want nothing!
In fact right now Bobby and
Richa are waiting for you..
..at Hilton Hotel's coffee shop.
And till the time you reach there..
..our man will look after them.
So don't worry.
Go there quickly, Sid!
Before we change our mind..
take them from there!
Bye!

No, Pam. It can't be so simple.
Somebody kidnaps my wife
and children. And..
And deposits 1.5 million
pounds in my account.
From that I give 50,000
pounds to their man.
And they are ready to release
Bobby and Richa. I mean..
You are right! There is much
more than what meets the eye.
Everything depends on that code.
Did you understand anything?
Sorry, boss. I didn't
understand anything.
54007. 007 is James Bonds number.
- You are serious, Pam?
I mean.. I don't know.
Seriously I just can't
understand, boss.
Keep trying! Keep trying! I
will call you later! Okay!
Yes, boss!
- Bye!
Richa!
Richa! Richa!
I had no other option than
stealing the car.. ok.
Sandy how could you?
How could you?
What was the need..
Princess Daisy.
- What?
I found something like a bracelet..
..and princess Daisy
is written on it.
Oh.. now I understood Richa..
Surely they must have kept
you in a princess's palace.
Sandy..
- I have got an idea.
I have got an idea! A book
shop! Yes a book shop!
Where is the damn book shop?
What?
Oh no.
All set, it's all set bro.
I have set the bird up.
I have clipped her wings too.
You can come and cut her throat.
Neither you nor I have to
cut her throat..
Siddharth has left.
You were right he can kill
anyone to save his wife.
He will reach on time.
Just stay away from
the prime minister..
..when the bullet is fired.
Or you might lose your
life along too.
And yes, you will receive
the rest of the money..
..once the work is done.
Have fun captain.
- Thank you bro.
Who are you?
Sam! Sam! Sam!
You are going to kill
the prime minister?
Why did you come back?
I am not going to let you do that.
Just Leave me!
Leave me!
Excuse me.
- Yes, how can I help you?
I am looking for a book on royalty.
Are you looking for
something particular?
I am looking for a book
on princess Daisy.
Princess Daisy!
How can you call princess
Daisy royalty?
So what do you want me
to call it, a horse?
Princess Daisy was a horse!
She was the finest in England.
Ruled the ascot.
But sadly, three months ago
she died in a stable fire.
Richa, that bracelet belongs to
a horse and not a princess.
And it..
Would you know where
that fire took place?
We have troubled you
a lot, isn't it.
Now, soon our work
will be complete..
..and your troubles will end.
You didn't understand. It's
time for you to die, darling.
I don't know what work you
are going to complete.
But please let me and Bobby go.
We will not tell anyone about you.
I cannot trust you.
But Bobby is still a child.
What do you think Monica,
shall we spare him?
But he has seen you darling.
Let's do one thing, let's
blind him. - No.
What if he described you to someone?
Then we will cut off his tongue too.
Darling, he can make a sketch.
We can spare him after cutting
off his fingers.
Monica, you are so unreasonable
at times.
It is Mrs. Verma's last wish
we will have to fulfill it.
See you Mrs. Verma.
Everything is over, Sandy.
Nothing is over Richa,
nothing is over.
Keep courage for a while.
I know where they have hidden you.
I will not let anything
happen to you.
I will not let anything
happen to you, Richa.
Sandy, I have never met you.
But I feel as if I have
known you for years.
You know, at times like these
even your kin don't help you.
And you are risking your
life for a stranger.
Really Sanjana is very lucky
to have someone like you.
I wish.. I could meet you and thank
you once before dying, Sandy.
But I think I will have
to do that on the phone.
Thank you for everything
Sandy and good bye.
Don't disconnect Richa,
don't disconnect.
Sandy, you did everything
that I asked you to.
You have to agree to
this last thing too.
Go back Sandy,
Because what I am going to do now,
no one can help me in that.
Good bye Sandy.
- Richa.
I know where you are Richa.
I am coming.
You stay there!
I am coming, okay!
I am.. Damn!
We have deposited 1.5
million pounds..
..in Siddharth Verma's account.
When the investigation
will take place..
..MI5 will know, that this money
has been transferred..
..from a numbered account.
Untraceable.
He has already made a payment
of 50,000 pound..
..further implicating him.
All the doubts will be on him.
Exactly at 6:30 out yacht will
be ready at the docks..
..and we will go away from here.
Relax captain, relax.
And about the wife and child.
Her husband will be forced to shoot
the Indian prime minister.
And we will kill his
wife and children.
No one will even suspect you.
Just stay away from
room number 1426.
Oh my God.
Don't be scared! Don't be scared!
I have come to help you.
Mummy!
Bobby.
Excuse me sir. - One second,
I'll call you back. Yes?
Can you step outside
for a minute please?
Is there a problem?
- Yes.
Okay.
One minute.
What's the problem?
Actually madam.. we don't know.
You can speak in front of me.
We just have found a dead body
in the hotel. A young lady.
There might be something wrong.
We don't want you to leave the room.
We suggest you cancel
your conference.
Cancel the conference?
I can't do that!
Excuse me mama, he is right.
Your security is much more
important than the conference.
They have found a dead body.
Until they don't find out
what the matter is..
I mean..I am not letting
you go anywhere. Please.
If anything happens to you..
- Nothing will happen.
If madam wants to, the conference
will surely take place.
I will take madam's responsibility.
I promise you everything
will be okay.
Are you sure.
- Of course I am.
Come on quick.
Come on, get in quick.
Look.. Catch them!
Hey.. Stop them!
Hey Stop them!
"54007, 007 is James Bond's number."
"Sorry boss, but I cannot
understand anything."
54 Bond Street.
Oh my God, they want to kill the PM.
Good evening Mr. Siddharth Verma.
You have understood
what we want to do.
Now understand what you want to do.
Richa! Richa!
Richa.
Monica.
Hello.
Take it easy girl.
Oh fish!
Hey Monica!
You?
- You?
Who are you?
Good that you have arrived?
But what are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?
Now that you have arrived,
do something Sandy.
Sa..Sandy!
- Yes Sandy, she is Richa.
Richa!
- Sanjana. My Sanjana.
But how did you come in,
all those goons.
I have taken care of all the goons.
Now I have to get you out.
Come on. Just a minute Sandy.
We don't have much time.
They are about to kill the PM.
We have to do something quick.
Oh my God.
Sanjana, take Bobby.
- Okay.
Richa, let's go..
Kabir Khan, Indian intelligence.
Ex.. Indian intelligence.
You.. why do you want to kill
the Indian prime minister?
Did you see Rohan?
I told you not to underestimate
Siddharth Verma.
He found out about our mission.
Good! Saves us the trouble.
Here.
This is the gun you have to use
to shoot the prime minister.
At 6 o'clock if you don't
fire, then I will.
And your wife and child will die.
Why you are doing this?
Me and my brother, kept rotting
in the Pakistan Jail..
..for 2 years, we kept
writing letters.
But the Indian government
refused to recognise us.
My brother died in front
of me, tolerating..
..the thrashing of the
Pakistanis for 2 years.
For the government, that
left his body unclaimed.
If Gayatri Devi wanted, we
could have been released.
Gayatri Devi was just the
defence minister then.
And you very well know,
anything can happen..
..on such secret missions.
I had joined the intelligence
to become a martyr..
..and not to die a silent death.
If you want to see your
wife and kid alive..
..I want to see the
prime minister dead.
Cell phone.
Room number 1426.
All the best.
Excuse me.
- Yes.
Hi I need your help, I am from MI5.
My name is Siddharth Verma
Yes Mr. Verma, I have
been waiting for you.
Room number 1426.
Officer.
Officer! Officer! We need to see
the prime minister right now!
Stop! Stop! I have to go in,
her life is in danger.
I am sorry, but you can't go in.
It is a matter of life
and death officer.
Please officer.
- Who are you two?
What do you want?
Officer! Officer.. Rohan,
Rohan Nath.
We have found the right
person at the right time.
You can surely help us. Officer,
my name is Richa Verma.
I am the wife of MI5 agent
Siddharth Verma.
Someone has conspired to kill
the Indian Prime minister here.
And they are using my
husband wrongly for it.
Where is your husband right now?
- Room 1426.
And my husband thinks that
they have kidnapped me.
That's why he is listening to them.
I have to meet him.
Come with me.
You stay here.
I..Come.
Well yes, yes. ..These
are troubled times.
Yes sir, reception good evening.
Ally, there is a man
in the lobby. Indian.
Tall, grey jacket. He knows
about us. Kill him.
Sight seeing is particularly
recommended.
Sorry ma'am.
Your time was right, but you
came to the wrong person.
Relax captain, relax.
What's wrong with that man, blind?
If you need something, don't call
room service, just tell me.
Everything set.
- Good.
You will receive the rest of
your money at the airport.
Thanks a lot.
Can I ask you something Raj?
The post would have been
yours sooner or later.
Then why this bloodshed?
She is going to lose
the next election.
But now her sacrifice
won't go waste.
Just imagine.
An Indian prime minister is
murdered in a foreign land.
And that too, a woman.
There will be tears
in everyone's eyes.
And those tears will
soon turn into votes.
Anyway, I am going to become
the prime minister.
But the important thing is that, the
party will not lose the elections.
And as you know.
A party is much greater
then an individual.
Politics!
I hate politics you know!
I just bloody hate politics!
Ally.
- Sir, there is a problem sir.
Now are you ensured that
we have your wife?
Now you get ready for
what you have to do.
Kill him.
I am sorry.
I hid my identity from you.
I put Bobby and you in this problem.
Ladies and gentlemen, I
give you the honourable..
..prime minister of India.
Mrs. Gayatri Sinha.
Thank you, thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed
an honour, opportunity..
..and privilege.
We have fought a lot
of evils together.
The greatest evil that plagues
our society today is terrorism.
It is the war of cowards that
they want to fight with us.
They want us to go on our knees..
..and give in to all their demands.
But we shall take the
fight to its end.
I believe, that history is nothing..
..but the road that we leave behind.
Our routes to our future and our
countries are both united.
In our future and in our past.
Maximum damage, with minimum means..
..is their mantra.
We shall not quietly
go into the dark.
For all of us, who choose
to bow down..
..stop, don't allow them that!
The enemy hides and
the enemy cheats.
But we shall not..
What are the chances, you may ask.
Stop.
Move.
Hey, police!
Come on get up! Get up! Move! Move!.
open the damn door. Come
on mama, come on.
Seal the damn place! Seal it!
I hope you are okay mama,
I hope you are okay.
Yeah, I am okay.
- I am so glad.
You know I can't believe this?
How can a head of state
be attacked like this?
Openly!
I am going to shoot everybody.
Thank God mama, nothing
happened to you.
I don't believe it mama, why would
an Indian shoot you here?
Unbelievable!
Raj, how did you know that
the shooter was an Indian?
Arrest him!
Relax captain, relax.
Sid!
Stop it Sid! Stop it!
Sid!
Excuse me sir.
The PM is calling you inside.
Mr. Sandeep Arora.
- Yes ma'am.
Please come in.
If I could, I would have
called you to Delhi..
..and given you the Paramveer
medal in front of everyone.
But my advisers tell me, it is best
that your names are not revealed.
No problem ma'am, I completely
understand.
You must be very proud of him.
There are very few people,
that risk their own life..
..to save others lives.
- Yes ma'am, I am very proud of you.
This is a personal
thank you from me.
If you need anything,
do let me know.
Thank you very much ma'am.
Thank you once again.
Did you see honey bun,
I am a brave man.
See, you are marrying a brave man.
So where do you want to
go for the honeymoon?
Sorry.
Phone.
Hello.
- Hello.
Hello! Yes.., Patara restaurant.
Where did you get this number from?
Where did I get this number from?
Excuse me she is MI5 agent
Siddharth Verma's wife.
Okay.
Listen, we have received
your marriage card.
Wish you all the best, and
have a great married life.
Thank you Richa.
And one more thing.
Sanjana and me are going
for a months honeymoon..
..after marriage. So if you are
planning to get kidnapped..
..do it after that, okay.
Alright.
Hello.

"Hello."
"Hello."
"Hello, is someone there.

"Say something."
"Who is this?" "Hello,

"Keep quiet.

"My beloved, listen
to my hearts desire."
"98211 14112, don't hang up please,
I think I am in love with you."
"Hello."
"Tell me, why you trouble
me everyday."
"Everyday, you sent
me 100 messages."
"Hello.
- Now what?"
"There are a hundred things
in the heart. - Oh really?!"
"Hello.
- Tell me."
"My nights are lonely.
- Whatever."
"I don't care about all that.
- Is it."
"98211 14112, don't hang up please,
I think I am in love with you."
"The number you are dialing
is currently unavailable."
"Please dial after some time."
"All the lines in this route are
busy." "Please try after some time."
"Hello.
- Not again."
"You have made my life
really miserable."
"Still I feel you
appear good to me."
"Hello, you cannot
control yourself."
"Hello, then why don't
you come close to me?"
"If that's so, then let's
meet somewhere in person."
"Wicked. 98211 14112."
- Speak to me now, I think
I am love with you."
