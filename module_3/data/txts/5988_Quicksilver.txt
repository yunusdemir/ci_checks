The market is higher
with the Dow-Jones industrials

On the commodities market,
grain closed higher
with November fixings at .03.
Three dollars
and seventy-five cents.
That's down 25 cents
from yesterday's close.
London silver is up one cent
to 6.08 cents, and the dollar...
Hey, hey!
See that guy up there?
Here's $50 if you can beat him
past the station.
All right, let's go, let's go!

Thanks a lot.
I'm gonna walk.
Listen, I've got an hour,
m-maybe... maybe two.
I'm gonna sell every option
I can get, steal or invent.
I don't know, Jack.
I'm scared.
Yeah, I got it covered.
Be sure, okay?
Okay. Relax, man.
All right.
I'll see you over there.
Okay.
Hey, Jack, what are you doing?
<i>I've got these 30s</i>
<i>at three dollars!</i>
I'll accept these 30s
at two and three quarters.
Buy 250,
two and three quarters.
Sold! Sold! Sold!
Sold at two and a half!
Sold! Sold!
Three hundred fifty...
three hundred seventy dollars.
We had it split for 300!
Sold!
Don't worry!
Hey, Jack,
what are you doin'?
I know what I'm doin'.
I know what I'm doin'.
- Sold at a quarter.
- Cancel my bid!
<i>Sold at a quarter!</i>
Sold at a quarter.
Hey, where is everybody?
<i>Where are my buyers?</i>
<i>This is it. This is it.</i>
Sold at a quarter.
- What's goin' on?
- quarter bid. Buy 20!
You got it. You got it.
What are you doin'?
Too low. Too low.
Cancel my stock.
Did you see
the way they were buyin'?
Relax, Gabe. The market
doesn't close for another hour.
Excuse me, guys.
Say, Jack, if Semco
moves one goddamn point up,
It's four million in margin
we're liable for.
It'll slide down.
What about Bressler? Didn't
they position with us?
No.
No? Sullivan?
It's like we got the goddamn
clap all of a sudden.
Whiskey, rocks
and club soda.
Jack.
Hi. How ya doin'?
How are you?
Well, Marcus will stand by us
if we lose a point or two.
He said he's thinking about it.
Semco's still trading.
He said he didn't know.
He said he didn't know?
Shhh.
Geez, that
son of a bitch!
We started him.
He owes us.
Come on. Table.
So the guy says to me,
"the horse was gelded late."
what do I know?
He said the horse
was gelded <i>light.</i>
<i>I'm thinking to myself...</i>
yes?
Mr. Casey,
telephone call.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Sam.
Thank you.
Hello?
Yeah.
What about Marcus?
Okay. Thank you.
Jack.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
The buyout took place.
Semco just closed at 30.
Mom?
Dad?
What is it, son?
Uh, dad, we've, um...
We've had some trouble.
See, we... we had this deal
that was goin', and, uh,
We were sellin' very heavily
on, on, on margin.
We didn't expect
this buyout to happen,
Which, unfortunately,
it did, and...
How bad is it, son?
Bad.
I lost it all.
Everything.
And you and mom...
your savings.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey! We're Caseys.
We can take a punch, right?
There'll be other days, son.
I was just
gonna make a sandwich.
Nice, nice roast beef.
Salt and pepper, mayonnaise.
Join me?
No. No, I can't, thanks.
Come on.
Your mother'll be right back
from the beauty parlor.
She'll be mad if you leave
without seeing her.
No, no, I got a taxi waitin',
and I got some other people
I gotta...
I got some things...
I can't.
Don't you worry about us, son.
You're gonna take a minute,
catch your breath,
get right back.
Right?
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure.
Won't change your mind?
No, I gotta go.
Here you go.
Thanks a lot.
falcons leading six to nothing,
And it's the wildcats' ball now
on their own 20-yard line...
As Norm Shutter, the quarterback,
spinning and handing off
to carnie foster.
He's loose at the 25, 30, 35...
he may go all the way.
40, 45, midfield stripe,
45, 40, 35, 30...
Carnie foster.
25, 20, 15, 10, 5...
Touchdown, wildcats.
An 80-yard run by carnie foster,
and this game is all tied up,
Six and six,
wildcats and falcons.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, watch it!
<i>what are you doin'? Hey, easy!</i>
Son of a bitch!
<i>quicksilver.</i>
See over there?
That's Apache.
<i>Before he got here, he</i>
<i>used to work for the mayor.</i>
<i>That's right, the mayor.</i>
Shortstop! Get over here.
I got one for you.
Seventh avenue,
two together. Go, shortstop.
Yes, that's right, sir.
Over there, that's France...
tour de France.
You know what he does?
he's a ballet dancer.
Really.
That's Teddy bear
and airborne.
Airborne over there was gonna be
the middleweight champion.
<i>Teddy bear's just saving up</i>
<i>to go back to college.</i>
Educated and dedicated. They
used to be college professors.
The rest of 'em around here
are just come and go's.
They come, try to ride
a couple of days,
They can't hack it, so they go.
Come and go's.
Don't worry, I'll hack it.
%%
They harpooned you
again, peewee.
Hey, Hector, a little
present for you... new pen.
So where are you from?
Different places.
Oh, yeah?
Like where?
Uh, Chicago, Detroit,
Denver. My family,
we moved around a lot.
Hmm.
<i>Yeah, my father's</i>
<i>in the air force.</i>
He's a jet pilot.
Yeah? No kiddin'?
Yeah.
He won a medal once.
Yeah, for savin' his
buddies in a plane crash.
They went down in the war.
<i>His arms were all burned,</i>
<i>and his hair too.</i>
That's why he
doesn't have eyebrows.
They never grew back.
Hey, look, I'm...
I'm sorry.
So, if you're gonna work here,
you're gonna need some wheels.
Tell you what.
Have this beauty right here.
It's in perfect shape,
brand-new tires.
And for 50 bucks,
I'll throw in the bag.
I don't have 50 bucks.
What do you have?
I got ten.
Ten?
Five down, five a week...
Till you pay me 55.
You just said 50!
Yeah, but on time payments,
you pay interest.
I know that much.
Okay.
Ooh, man,
it's a mean machine.
Yo, look, don't touch.
Okay, man.
I won't touch your bike.
What you doin'
with these chicken bones
around your neck?
Hey, man, be more respectful
of your African heritage.
Youngblood, I want coffee.
I want it light.
<i>I want it sweet. Now!</i>
<i>What you still doin' here?</i>
Okay, okay.
Money, money, money.
He makes all that money
bein' a messenger?
Yeah, well,
he's not too particular
what he carries...
<i>And for who.</i>
it's gonna be a good day today.
Spider, do me a favor.
See what Murray’s got for me.
Yo. I'll check.
Thank you, man.
<i>Hey, Jack,</i>
<i>how you doin', man?</i>
How you doin', Hector?
What's new? How's Maria?
<i>Ah, very big.</i>
<i>She's out to here.</i>
Doctor says no twins,
but I don't know.
<i>Six on midtown.</i>
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

<i>- How you doin'?</i>
All right, look,

Okay. I'll see you

- Hey, Joey.
- Yeah, what is it?
Another bum.
No money.
No, I did have it.
I swear to God.
Yeah, I've heard that before.
Where the hell did I put it?
I gave him a five,
I put five in my pocket...
Hey, Pete.
What's your name?
What's it to you, huh?
I just want to know who
I'm loaning five bucks to.
Terri.
Where you from, Terri?
D.C.
Thanks.
Thank you.
- Three.
- Five.
That's too much.
Five... Or get out.
Okay, we'll take 'em.
Five thousand.
Come on, come on,
come on. Take it.
No, I haven't seen him
for a while.
Yeah, I know. It's business
before pleasure, baby.
I've gotta go now.
Bye.
I'll catch you later.
Hey, gypsy, what's happenin'?
What is this?
Huh?
You deliver short, hustle
my customers for yourself?
Wait a minute.
What you talkin' about?
You don't work for me no more.
Go back to bumpin' envelopes.
Disappear.
The street is free
enterprise, gypsy.
<i>You work your side.</i>
I work mine.
Come on, come on...
come on, man!
Hey.
Emilio, let me have a hot dog
with everything on it...
<i>And a vegetarian</i>
<i>for my friend here.</i>
It's <i>chevere,</i> man.
Beautiful!
Look at the wheels.
They're new.
Yeah, well, almost new.
And dig, man,
it's got two sections.
Got your hot dogs,
got your ices.
The umbrella...
I'd get rid of that.
I'd put my own, you know.
Thank you.
"Hector's hot dogs."
uh-huh. Uh-huh.
So what do you think, man?
You know what I think?
I think you're gonna get
flat feet standin' in one place.
Ah, there's
no future on a bike.
You fall, you get hurt,
can't work, no money.
Look, I want something
to look forward to.
Can't stay on a bike
forever, man.
Seventh avenue,
two of 'em, shortstop.
Go ahead.
I'm telling you, they would
never kick a door down,
not my guys.
- Apache, midway. Go.
- <i>I'm goin'.</i>
Whoa. Excuse me.
You dropped something.
- Thanks.
- Okay.
hey, all right!
All right!

Come on, fellas.
Back to work.
Anyway, I see interest rates
going down.
The fed is expanding
the money supply,
So I would move
to decrease our cash position,
increase stock equity.
Yeah, but not yet.
Interest rates will bump
a few more points first.
I'd buy high tech...
IBM, Teledyne. What?
That's what
old man Anderson said.
I wasn't sure.
Now I am.
Listen, Jack.
I want to be straight with you.
Anderson wants to back us.
But it's you they really want.
I'm just part of the package.
I mean, not that I'm not good.
I make that jerk Anderson
look like a hero.
But I don't have
half of what you have.
You had the touch, Jack.
Anyway, he'll back us
a hundred percent.
I spoke to the lawyers,
Burke and Blum.
They're the best.
Two years, three years tops,
we buy out Anderson's interest.
And, Jack, we'd be back
in business our way.
Gabe, I'm happy for you.
I am. But... I can't.
- What do you mean, can't?
- Look, you're my friend.
The best. And I know you
want it to be like it was,
but it's not for me.
Not now.
You're telling me that driving
a bike, delivering junk,
that's for you?
I don't believe it, Jack.
I don't.
If not now, Jack, when?
Gabe, don't you understand?
I don't have it anymore.
I don't have the nerve.
Okay, you see, that was my...
That's what drove me.
And it went that day.
I don't know where it went,
you know, but it's gone.
And, you see, now all
I'm responsible for is me.
Okay? I pick up here,
I deliver there.
It's simple.
Nobody worries.
Nobody gets hurt.
I pay my rent.
I got a couple extra bucks.
If I need more, I work
a few more runs.
And when I'm on the street,
I feel good, man.
I feel... Good.
I feel... Exhilarated.
I go as fast as I like,
faster than anyone.
A street sign says
"one way, east," I go west.
They can't touch me.
When I'm on a bike,
I forget about...
Well, I don't know. I...
Hey, no, no, no, no.
No, I got it, I got it,
I got it, I got it.
Thanks for the coffee.
Hey, what's that mean
right there, Jack?
Collateral.
Right. What's
"collateral" mean?
What's this?
"loan application."
what are you doin'?
I'm borrowing some money.
Well, you know, for the cart.
Ahhh.
So?
So what?
So what does "collateral"
mean exactly?
It means you ain't
gettin' no loan.
What it means is,
you've gotta have capital goods.
- Capital goods?
- Yeah.
Something that is worth
the same amount or more
than the principle.
The principle is the amount
of money you want to borrow.
Seven grand.
Yeah, right. You got
something worth $7,000?
Oh, yeah.
His pretty ass on the street.
let me get this straight.
You mean I gotta have
something worth seven Gs if
I want to <i>borrow</i> seven Gs?
- Right.
- Shit, if I had something
worth seven grand,
What the hell would I need
to ask the bank for?
Well, it's a little
more complicated than that.
Don't you understand, brother,
that you's a spick, a beaner?
I mean, ain't gonna be
no white shirt and tie for you.
<i>It takes it to get it.</i>
<i>The man says,</i>
"if you don't have it,
then you ain't gonna get it."
It ain't the man
that steals your future.
It's your bitterness.
Oh! Oh, I guess I'm just
a dumb ol' uptown nigger.
I don't know nothin' about
what Jack here knows, right?
Right.
Well, if that's the case,
and Jack is so smart,
Then what's he doin' here?
Hey... hey, voodoo, you got
somethin' to say to me?
- I say you full of shit, Jack.
I say he'll beat
your ass on any street,
any day of the week.
Oh, yeah? Well, where
did you hear this? I want
to know how you knew that.
Because your big mouth
would catch too much wind,
that's why.
All right, flyboy.
money talks...
And bullshit walks.
Hey, hey, hey. Check it out.
It's on the table, man.
- Hey, I'll take some of that.
- Yeah!
hey, voodoo, we down.
Hey, where are you
going, Jack?
Look, Hector.
This is a job, okay?
It's not a game. I got
deliveries to make.
Hey, but the fellas,
they got the money down on you.
<i>I got a cheese sandwich</i>
<i>and a coffee.</i>
<i>You can give the change</i>
<i>to Bernadette, all right?</i>
Okay.
Hey, watch it!
Yo! One side!
Hey!
what's the matter with you?
What are you doing riding
on the sidewalk? Are you crazy?
Wait a second! I gotta
get this stuff picked up!
%% lately I feel like
I keep losing ground %%
%% every day, running in place %%
%% tearing around
on this merry-go-round %%
%% same rat race %%
%% oh, but I get so hungry
to break from the pack %%
%% I'm goin' far %%
%% oh, so far %%
%% lightnin' I am lightnin' %%

%% I am trading

- Voodoo!
I'm tellin' you, Jack,
forget about it.
You're messin' in something
you don't know nothin' about.
All I'm sayin' is...
He could've avoided him.
He could've.
I was there, man.
He ran him down for nothin'.
Not just for nothin'.
Voodoo was known to carry
product for some people.
- Yeah, to gypsy.
- I don't know who.
He doesn't know who.
The brothers know who.
I don't wanna know who.
Voodoo stepped
into that meat grinder because
he wanted the fast money.
He volunteered.
Just be happy
it wasn't a closer race...
Or there would've been
two funerals.
Dig?
<i>yeah. Quicksilver.</i>
Oh, yeah. Sure.
She's still with us.
Right. Uh-huh.
You got it.
Terri?
What?
Terri, you got
a command performance.
2829 grand.
- What's a command performance?
- That means you did a good job.
They asked for you by name.
Terri.
- Come here.
- I can't. I'm working.
Yeah, 2829 grand.
That's me. Come here.
You know where this is?
<i>Yeah.</i>
Yeah? You didn't look
at the address.
- 21 west 88th street.
- Know where that is?
Yeah, it's off the park.
What do you need me for?
You got a car.
You wanna conduct an interview,
or do you wanna work?
I was just...
look, Terri.
I'll find someone else.
Give it back.
No, that's all right.
I'll do it. I-I'm sorry.
Terri.
I'll call you
from time to time.
<i>I call... You come.</i>
%%
Thank you, Maria.
So?
So it's all there.
All right.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. You don't
have the money yet.
<i>All you got there</i>
<i>is a neatly typed</i>
<i>loan application.</i>
What I got here is a Chance...
a Chance at somethin' better.
Yeah, we'll see.
Friday, huh?
Yeah.
Hey, Jack, I'm telling you,
this is just the beginning.
This cart is just number one.
I'm gonna work hard.
I'm gonna watch the money.
Pretty soon two,
then three, then four.
Who knows? Five, six.
You're gonna see "Hector."
That's my dream.
Well, you know, Hector,
sometimes things don't
work out the way you plan.
I mean, they can
backfire on you...
Knock you lower
than where you started.
Jack, when you come
from around here, ain't
no place to go but up.
Jesus, man, you are
one optimistic Mexican.
Listen, Hec,
uh... When you go to see
the loan officer on Friday,
Wear something nice,
like a suit.
Dress like a winner...
Be a winner.
Right.
Hi, Jack.
Hello, pat.
I got a pickup for Macy.
Thank you.
Uh-huh.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Hey, Terri!
Hey, what the hell
are you doin'?
Hey, you moron!
Whoa! Ohh!
You okay?
Let me see that.
Yeah.
No sweat. I'm okay.
Let me see it. Come on,
come on, come on.
Whoa.
All right, uh...
here, look.
Put this around...
yeah.
Ju-just hold it
there, okay?
So, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Who's gonna fix
your bike?
I'll take care of it.
You know how
to reset a wheel?
Yeah.
No.
You don't have a bike,
you don't work.
You know? You don't work,
you don't get paid.
There's no workman's comp...
yeah, I don't need
a lecture, okay?
I told you I'll take care of it,
I'll take care of it.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate what you've done.
Okay?
What are you doin'?
I told you I'd take care of it.
Come on, tough guy.
How come it's so empty in here?
Less to miss.
Ah! Ah, this is you, isn't it?
Hector said you were some kind
of big head honcho once.
No one knew
what you were, but...
is that what Hector said?
Well, you know Hector.
He likes... he likes myths.
What he doesn't find,
he invents.
Were you?
Was I what?
Were you rich?
You look like you were.
Oh, yeah?
What does rich look like?
suntan at Christmastime.
Yeah, always smiling
'cause there's nothin'
ever to worry about.
You know, like on TV
on those commercials.
They're always smiling.
What happened
to all of it?
To all of what?
To all that money.
Nothing happened to it.
The money's still there. It just
belongs to somebody else now.
If I had it,
I'd never lose it. No way.
You can lose anything in life.
Well... There you go.
Thanks.
So, you makin' any money?
I'm doing all right.
Yeah, well,
the reason I ask is...
Being a messenger isn't
for everybody, you know.
I'm doin' fine.
Okay.
It's just that, uh...
There are other jobs that'd be
a little easier on the bones...
Say, waitressing.
I don't like waiting
on people. I don't like
touching their food.
Look, Terri, let me try
to explain this, okay?
There are people out there
who use messengers...
To do their dirty work.
You know?
So it's our ass
instead of theirs.
- You know what
I'm talkin' about?
- Yeah, I do. It's cool.
Okay.
What are you doin'?
I'm oiling my chain.
Why?
Make it go faster.
It does?
Yeah.
Hmm.
- You livin' with your folks?
- No, I live with a friend...
A girlfriend of mine.
Your family here in the city?
Yeah.
No, actually, my parents
like to travel a lot.
- So they're in Vegas right now.
- Oh, yeah? Vacation?
Uh... No.
They work there.
- They're singers.
- Huh.
I don't know if you've heard
of 'em. They're pretty famous.
They open
for Frank Sinatra’s act.
They're very close with Frank.
No kidding.
Yeah. A lot of people
don't know this, but Frank
is a profoundly religious man.
I should know.
He's my godfather.
Of course, I don't remember
a lot of him, because, you know,
I was a baby and everything.
But he sends me birthday cards
and Christmas cards.
He's a good man.
I know a lot of famous people.
Let's see. Who do I know?

<i>Hey!</i>

Have a look at it.
Quick release, huh?
Right. Make things a lot
easier on yourself.

Oh, shit.

I thought I'd come by for
you guys to wish me luck.
- Hey, Hector, you gonna
audition for the four tops?
- Hey, funny.
Hec, what is this?
What are you doing?
What? What's the matter?
The tux. Why are you
wearing a tux?
You told me to.
No. I told you to wear a tux?
- You said, "wear somethin'
nice. A suit," you said.
- Yeah. A <i>suit.</i>
- So I ain't got no suit.
- So buy one. Borrow one.
From who? What money?
Hey, Jack look... I blow
a hundred bucks on a suit,
and what do I got?
<i>A crummy suit</i>
<i>pee-wee Herman wouldn't</i>
<i>wear to his own funeral.</i>
- But for 40 bucks, I got
the best tux Hernando had.
- Hernando?
Hernando. Go ahead.
Feel it.
Come on. Touch it. Feel
the fabric. This is <i>linen.</i>
This is a 250
set of threads.
So many ruffles.
Yeah.
- Did I screw up? Jack,
did I do somethin' wrong?
- No.
No. Uh, look...
Say you came from
a wedding, okay?
Say you came straight from
a wedding right to the bank.
Yeah, but I...
Hector, just do it, okay?
Okay.
Hey, Hec...
- Good luck.

Bastard.
Okay...
Hi, dad.
Jackie.
Here you are.
I thought maybe
you got held up.
No, no.
You came all the way
on that thing?
Yeah, yeah. So,
what's the damage here?
All the way from the city?
Yeah.
Why didn't you call me?
I would have picked you up.
It's okay.
I like to ride.
Is the alternator shot?
Plymouths are a pain.
Everything is ass-backwards.
Let me give you a hand.
You got grease
on your hands right now.
It's okay. It's all right.
- Dinner's ready.
- Hi, mom.
- Hi, Jackie.
- We'll be in
in a minute, all right?
Well, just don't
make it too long.
Mar, where's the paper?
It's right there
on the chair.
Oh.
So, how do you like Notre Dame?
I like Notre Dame.
That's the <i>wall street journal.</i>
Yeah, I know what it is.
So aren't you gonna look?
I gotta go.
Where are you going?
I don't want
to start anything.
What am I supposed to do
to make you realize...
there's nothin' to talk about.
The hell there isn't
anything to talk about.
There's something.
I'm your father.
I say there is, damn it.
You wanna talk? Let's talk, huh?
Talk about you working
a double shift at the garage.
Let's talk about you fixing
these junk cars in the yards
on weekends, huh?
Let's talk about you
and mom not being able
to take a vacation.
That's not the issue. We are
talking about your future.
You are smart.
You have brains.
You're throwin' it away
on that goddamned bicycle.
What about your future, dad?
You and ma.
What... mar, what am I supposed
to do to get through to that
thick skull of his?
What? Just
tell me, please!
Remember that day, dad?
What day?
- I said to you,
"dad, I lost it all"?
- Why are we bringing this up?
You know what he says
to me? "we Caseys,
we can take a punch."
- Right. We <i>can</i> take a punch.
- And then you wanted
to make me a sandwich!
I tell you I've lost
everything you and mom have...
And you're worried
if I'm hungry or not.
You know, I went out
to the cab and, uh,
I thought about what you said.
And I guess I really...
I really wanted to believe it.
You didn't hear me
come back in, did you?
You were sitting right there
all slumped over...
You know, in my whole life,
I never saw you cry...
Not once... until that day.
I gotta go finish
Sweeney’s car.
I don't understand you, son.
You make me so damn <i>mad.</i>
You ever try eating
one of these things?
They're Terrible.
You wanna try another bank?
Ah, wouldn't do no good.
Would it?
- No.
You know, I've been
on both sides.
Being a messenger is not so bad.
I ain't going back
to riding no bike, Jack.
Hey, and besides,
We have our own
lending institutions
here in the neighborhood.
<i>Se habla Español.</i>
No. No, th-they'll bleed you.
That's crazy, man. They...
they break people's legs.
Jack, you been watching
too many movies.
Hey, they don't do that no more.
Not all the time.
Look, I gotta get out of here.
I gotta return this monkey suit
or else they're gonna stick me
for another day.

I was...
a very successful
stockbroker.
I peeked at your clippings.
clippings! My God,
a celebrity.
In three years on the floor,
Jack grossed $30 million.
- My, my.
- - it was some kind of record, wasn't it, Jack?
Yeah, yeah, I set
another record.
I lost it all in 24 hours,
right down the toilet.
Excuse me.
<i>was it something I said?</i>
you guys go
ahead. Go on.
I want you to come with us.
Come on. I want you
to be their friends too.
Come on.
Come with us.
I can't leave it.
Leave it.
It'll get ripped off.
I need my bike, you know?
I'm a bicycle messenger?
It's just a job.
A job for kids.
It's my life.
It's a waste of life.
Leave it.
I don't want to.
All right!
Oh, shit.
Hey.
Hey, what's
goin', Jack?
I'll, uh...
I forgot my...
I for...
I'll be back.
Okay.
That'll do it for you?

Look. Even here,

Look... Hector?
Um, you know, I-I've been

What'd you say?
You don't need him.
Jack, come on. What
are you talkin' about?
Listen, I-I've been noticing
a trend in the market...
the stock market...
And I...
I see some leverage.
See, I was a trader.
Yeah, and?
I was one of the best, and...
I could take
your money in for you.
And we could lose, huh?
We could, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.

What are you doin' here?
Uh, could you
help me out?
I, uh... I would've
called you, but...
I don't have a phone.
You're right.
No, I...
I don't need that.
Um...
Look, I need a place
to crash tonight.
It's just for tonight.
I don't wanna make any waves
between you and your girlfriend.
I noticed you had a big place.
I was just gonna take
a space in the corner. I'll
be out before you wake up.
<i>I got kicked out of my</i>
<i>girlfriend's apartment,</i>
<i>so I thought that...</i>
Uh,
I guess you can sleep
on the couch.
<i>You know, there's some</i>
<i>blankets in the chest...</i>
Oh, no, that's okay.
I brought my sleeping bag.
Where's your girlfriend?
%%
%%
Look, there's a pay phone
on the corner, okay?
Why don't you go downstairs and
call your mother and father?
What?
In Vegas... isn't that
where you said they were?
I don't wanna bother them.
No, wait. Uh, I'm sure
if you called them,
Told them you were in a jam,
they'd help you out.
Parents are like that.
- So?
- So what?
So are you going to call them?
I told you, they're busy.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, they're...
they're busy in Vegas
singing with Frank, right?
They're not in Vegas,
are they, Terri?
Who are you, dick Tracy?
If you don't want me
to stay here, just say so.
I got other friends.
Aw, cut the bullshit,
would you, Terri?
I-I mean, you tell Hector
that you're from Chicago,
That your father is some kind
of a jet pilot/war hero,
<i>Then you tell me</i>
<i>they're singin' in Vegas</i>
<i>with Frank Sinatra?</i>
So what is it with you?
Why did you lie to me?
What about you? What are you,
some big man/stockbroker...
With millions on wall street...
And pictures
of expensive vacation
and fancy girlfriends, huh?
Or is it Jack
the bicycle messenger...
Living in some... Warehouse
like a stray cat?
What about that one, huh?
You don't know what
you're talking about.
So do me a favor...
Call up mommy and daddy
and go back to wherever
you ran away from.
I wish that I could, but, uh...
There isn't gonna be anyone
there to take the call.
You're supposed to have
all these brains, right?
You're supposed to be
really smart, huh?
You're dumb.
You see, you have all these
choices that you can make.
I don't have any choices.
I'm sorry that I bothered you.
Hey, hey, hey, where are
you goin', hothead, huh?
Look, um,
I-I thought you needed
a place to stay?
So stay, all right?
I want you to stay.
Okay?
Okay.

Yeah, look, I need to get on

Sure.

So, what do you like today?
I'm gonna spread out, I guess.
Try to build up some momentum.
I'm looking for lightning

You can make that happen,
Mr. Casey. I remember.
Look, if it's okay, I'd like

I'm down but I'm not out!
Why didn't you come talk to me?
I'm talkin' to you now.
