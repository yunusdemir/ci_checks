THE SAMURAI
There is no greater solitude
than the samurai's,
unless perhaps it be
that of the tiger in the jungle.
Bushido, Book of the Samurai
Saturday, 4th April, 6pm.
Jeff?
This evening I came round
at a ¼ past 7 and stayed till 2am.
Impossible. Wiener called.
He said he'd be back at two.
All right, a ¼ past 7 until a ¼ to two.
I like it when you come round
because you need me.
It is your say.
How long will you be here?
We rented the room for the night.
Count me in from 2 o'clock.
Bring money, in case you lose.
I never lose.
Not really.
- Who are you?
- Not important.
What do you want?
To kill you.
General alert!
Routine round-ups
and identity checks all night.
The killer is believed to be tall, young,
wearing hat and raincoat.
Every precinct give me at least 20 suspects.
So what if it makes 400?
The population's 10 million.
Hurry, in an hour it'll be too late.
Police! Open up!
Identity check.
Your papers, gentlemen.
- How long have you been here?
- Since 7 o'clock.
What about you?
9 or a ¼ past.
- How do you support yourself?
- Full disability pension, wounded veteran.
When did you get here?
2 or a ¼ past 2.
Come along with me. Routine check.
If you have legal means
of support, you'll be released.
Quiet !
Damolini, Ange Séraphin, 41 .
Rocaillou precinct.
Picked up in a bar,
corner of rue Saint-Dominique.
Carrying a 7.65mm gun.
Take off the glasses.
What have you to say?
Me? Not a thing.
What were you doing
with a gun in your pocket?
Next.
Over here!
Garcia, Juan, 47,
and Delbarre, Jeanne, 51.
Precinct of la Gare.
Picked up in the street.
The man armed with a 7.65mm.
Take off your hat.
You aren't married, are you?
Living together?
Why the weapon?
The streets aren't safe at night
in Paris.
It's just to defend myself in case I'm attacked.
Consider your record.
1945: sentenced to 6 months
for incitement of minors to vice.
1950: 12 months for narcotics trafficking.
1952: attempted burglary.
1955: living off the avails of prostitution.
1958: attempted murder.
1960: involuntary manslaughter,
insufficient evidence.
Well?
Next.
Costello, Jeff, 30.
No criminal record,
matches description given.
Carrying no weapon.
The man wore a hat.
Put your hat on.
It wasn't a hat like that.
It was darker.
No, it was a light colour.
He had a moustache, I think.
Why did you shave your moustache, Costello?
I've never worn a moustache in my life.
I don't think it was him.
No, certainly not.
Sorry, but l think it is.
I remember exactly how the man looked.
Yes, indeed, it could be him.
Where were you from midnight to 2?
At my fiancée's.
Can we know the name, address and phone number of this lucky girl.
Is that necessary?
As you wish. Suspects without alibis are held in remand.
Jane Lagrange,
11 avenue de l'Amiral Bruix.
Telephone?
Mac-Mahon 91-73.
Mlle Lagrange, please.
No, Mlle Lagrange alone.
Aside from the gentleman
who escorted you here,
any other visitor last night?
ItMs not an inquiry into your private life.
You have the right to see whomever you wish.
That is not within the scope of the law.
I simply want to know whether,
before Monsieur Wiener arrived at two,
you had another visitor?
98.5
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:46,879
Yes.
Until when? And who?
Until a ¼ to 2. A man.
I imagined so.
The same age as M. Wiener?
No, younger.
Around thirty?
Yes, around thirty.
The time?
From 7 or a ¼ past,
until a ¼ to 2.
Sure it was a ¼ to 2?
I made him leave, because
I was expecting M. Wiener at 2.
Yes, I understand.
Now, just for verification.
The name of this 30-year old man?
- Do I have to say?
- Oh, yes.
Jeff Costello.
Will you wait a moment, please?
He didn't mention
that he knew the victim well?
- Why didn't you tell him?
- Because it's false.
You'll have to substantiate that.
No, I believe you're obliged
to substantiate the contrary.
What you won't be able to deny,
or not for long anyway,
is your frequent visits
to that establishment.
I've never set foot in it.
What is it you want?
Costello's confession
to a crime he didn't commit?
Don't you think you're over-doing it?
In a few minutes I'll make you
 change your tone.
125.5
00:28:40,843 --> 00:28:42,004
I'll get back to you later.
Bring Wiener straight in here.
M. Wiener, you arrived at Mlle
Lagrange's, around 2 or ¼ past?
That is correct.
I ask you to think carefully
 before answering me.
Did you get the feeling,
when you arrived,
that someone had just left?
Excuse my frankness, but...
Did you feel that your place
 was still warm?
- Pardon?
- I must insist.
I'm not very observant.
That's too bad for everyone concerned.
I do remember something though.
When I entered Mlle Lagrange's apartment,
someone had already pressed the light button.
I noticed a man going past me,
on his way out.
Now upon reflection,
he was no more than 3 meters from her door
and could well have just left her place.
Could you recognise this man?
I don't think so.
Let me try an experiment?
146.5
00:30:13,167 --> 00:30:14,247
Follow me.
Hats and coats on, gentlemen.
Form up in 3 rows.
You come with me.
Stand over there.
Change coats with him.
And you, your hat.
Please come with me.
Do you recognise the man you passed at around 2am
in Mlle Lagrange's hallway?
Do you recognise anyone?
I have a composite image
of the man I passed.
A raincoat like that.
A hat like that.
Or that one.
And a face like this gentleman.
What would the result have been
if you were observant?
Will you come with me, please?
That's it.
Mademoiselle, monsieur, I apolgize.
Our work sometimes..
requires us to exceed the bounds of courtesy.
If you don't need me, may I go?
Certainly.
168.5
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:40,995
I really like your way...
of not concerning yourself with the private lives of people.
I'm investigating a crime.
I can't be choosy about my methods
of trapping or clearing a suspect.
Time's precious.
May I go too?
Of course.
Show Mademoiselle out.
I'm going to show you Costello
once more.
Try to be categorical.
No maybes or perhapses.
Either it IS him or it ISN'T. Understood?
Show him in.
Do you recognise this man?
Did you see him go out the
office door into the hall?
No, absolutely not.
Thank you. Would you go in my office.
Do you still recognize this as
the man who left by the hall door?
I can answer that categorically.
I'm asking you to.
Yes, it was him.
Would you go to my office.
Do you recognise this man?
Frankly, I don't think so.
Same question.
I'm not sure. I'd need to see
the other one again.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
Impossible to answer categorically.
Mademoiselle, only you got a good look
at the man who killed Martey.
You were one meter away. I can either try to break his alibi,
since one witness
has formally identified him,
or he'll go free,
depending on your answer.
And that'll be the end of it.
I'm in no doubt whatsoever.
He's definitely not the man.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
The least I can do.
That's all, gentlemen.
Sunday, 5.45am.
May I go?
Unfortunately.
- How many suspects left?
- Nine.
Same routine for them all.
A nice way to spend Sunday.
What do you think about Costello?
I never think.
#1 rue Lord Byron.
He just went in #1 rue Lord Byron.
I'll circle around the Champs-Elysées,
then back here
to see if he comes out.
Watch it. The building has a another entrance
on the Champs Elysées: 116B rue Normandie.
I'm just in front.
Stay there and report.
I'll park on the avenue.
He's out. He's taking the metro.
Follow him. Or try anyway.
He got away on the Vincennes line. What do l do?
In that case, come home as usual.
Done.
I know. You were arrested, last night?
Not important.
Perfect. As promised...
We absolutely can't leave him
on the loose.
He's been picked up
and held for several hours.
The fact he's been freed proves nothing.
He must still be a suspect.
I don't think so.
He worked out a fantastic alibi.
Suppose they crack it?
Impossible. It's a double whammy,
2 distinct witnesses.
I got it. He's really good,
that's why we used him.
He fulfilled the contract:
to kill Martey
without leaving a trace.
He's a lone wolf.
He's a wounded wolf,
now he'll leave a trail.
He must disappear quickly.
The police won't find a culprit,
so they'll stay on his trail.
Despite his alibi, he's still their
number one witness as well as suspect.
We'll be on his trail, too.
I expect you won't let him slip
through your fingers again.
Not the slightest proof,
yet something stinks.
What?
I don't know.
He's odd.
I can keep a tail on the other
suspects for 48 hours, but not him.
- His alibi holds up.
- Too well.
Wiener's absolutely sincere.
But the girl's lying, I'm sure.
We have to find a way to crack her,
so she'll talk.
And the Examining Magistrate can
charge her with perjury or something.
We'll have our Jeff Costello,
sitting in a chair right here.
If he's like you say,
he'll laugh in our faces.
I don't think so.
Have you seen many guys who
still have nothing to say
after two days in handcuffs?
I haven't.
Keep after the girl
but don't lose sight of him.
Sunday, 10 p.m.
271.5
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:56,718
- What would you like, sir ?
- Whisky.
If you were the man the police want, you could say...
the killer always returns
to the scene of the crime.
May I get in?
274.5
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:00,736
Yes.
Why say you didn't recognise me?
Why did you kill Martey?
I was supposed to be paid.
What had he done to you?
Not a thing.
I didn't know him.
The first and last time I met him
was 24 hours ago.
What sort of man are you?
You knew Martey and what's worse,
your lack an alibi.
I was driving between Fontainebleau and Paris.
With no one to witnesses it.
It'll need verifying.
285.5
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:09,958
This way.
- The others?
- Nothing, seems the snitches are on strike.
Bite your tongue!
- Here's something new.
- What?
A package Costello dumped
as he left his place.
What's in it?
Blood, gauze, cotton wool.
Costello's hurt.
- Interesting. You know where he is now?
- Of course.
Not much time to find out
who wanted Martey out of the way.
What's that to you?
At the pay-off they tried to kill me.
I don't want them to try again,
I have to find them before they find me.
The little blond guy I met on the footbridge
didn't give me much time to think.
Him, and his boss, I need to find.
You know them. They hired you.
No I dealt with an intermediary.
There are two explanations for why you didn't identify me...
could be you like playing games
with the police,
or that you weren't supposed
to recognise me.
While I'm arrested, I'm an indirect threat to the intermediary
and to whoever ordered the killing.
So?
If he's a friend of yours you'll lead me to him.
6:10. Phone me here in 2 hours.
Monday, 7am.
310.3
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:20,923
Jeff?
310.5
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:22,082
Yes.
Terrible, aren't they?
Impossible to rein in their zeal.
You know, in the Police,
promotion is very important.
When I was younger I was over-zealous too.
- Whereas now you're more fatalistic?
- Exactly.
If the case doesn't move by itself
you just drop it.
I don't like to get confessions
or statements by forcing things.
318.5
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:15,725
How about that!
I'm very liberal,
a great believer
in individual liberty,
Everyone must live as they see fit.
The main thing is that the way of life
they choose harms no one else,
doesn't disturb public peace
nor contravene public decency.
- Don't you agree?
- All this effort to tell me what, exactly?
To tell you this: youswore Jeff Costello was with you
the night of Martey's murder,
between 7pm and 1.45am.
- Is that it?
- It is.
Imagine that Costello wasn't with you
for those 6 hours, and I find out.
You'll be laying yourself open to
charges of perjury, contempt of court,
obstruction of justice
and accessory to murder.
Best case scenario: you'll get five years.
Five years is a long time,
especially for a girl of your age.
If I'm telling you this
it's because it so happens
I have a daughter your age,
and that would pain me.
No kidding?
340.5
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,128
Oh yes.
You're wrong not to believe me.
You seem to be a fine young woman.
Very fine, in fact.
Your attitude has shown one thing:
you have courage.
I don't know many women who'd do what you did
for a boyfriend, sorry...
For a fiancé.
Your loyalty is impeccable.
But him? No, not at all.
- Have you seen him since?
- No.
I thought not...
Little jerk.
Do you know where he is right now?
- No.
Would you like to know?
354.5
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,371
No.
I'll tell you anyway.
He's with that nightclub pianist.
Since that night they're inseparable.
Seems it's the "great love of his life".
You don't seem to mind.
You don't love the boy?
360.5
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:49,291
No.
Well...
I'd have thought you did.
Because by running such risks for him,
I figured you must love him.
You're less of a psychologist
than you think.
That must be it.
I imagined him as your...
How do they put it?...
Love of your life.
And the respectable gentleman,
Wiener,
as the one who pays the rent.
It's odd, girls like you are
so very nearly prostitutes.
Have you ever thought about it?
373.5
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:31,012
No.
You should.
It could turn around and bite you in the ass,
if the Vice Squad chose to.
You don't play games with the Vice Squad.
You need to be covered.
No pun intended.
You'd cover for me?
Better than that.
I'd like to help you out of this spot.
This is your statement.
Tell me, without witnesses,
Costello wasn't here the night of the murder,
and I'll tear it up, without a word.
No more perjury charge. Nothing
And you won't have
to make another statement.
What about the Vice Squad?
You have my word. Nothing will happen.
I knew you were an intelligent girl.
If I understand you right,
you ask me to perjure myself,
in order to have no problems.
If I maintain the truth against your wish,
then I can expect go through Hell.
Is that right?
Not quite.
The truth isn't what you say.
It's what I say,
despite the methods I am obliged
to employ to get at it.
So?
Is it yes?
It's no.
As you wish.
But we'll meet again.
Put it back.
Come on!
We made two mistakes.
The first was thinking
your arrest was a set-up.
The second was thinking your
release represented a danger to us.
I tried to kill you to reduce
 these two risks.
Now we feel we should begin again
on a healthy footing.
Here's the balance of the 2 million
you're owed for Martey's killing.
You were hired so there'd be no fallout.
Imagine how we felt when
we learned you were a suspect.
We have another thing to ask of you.
Here's two more million.
Paid in advance this time.
Same kind of operation,
another contract.
Nothing to say?
I never talk to a man holding a gun.
Is that a rule of yours?
A habit.
Get up.
I'll answer with a question:
who sent you?
I can't tell you that.
Yet you could try
to kill me on the bridge.
Look at me.
I'll ask you a second time.
There'll be no third.
Who? Name and address.
You don't know him.
He's not like you and me.
Don't keep me waiting.
Olivier Rey.
The address.
73 boulevard de Montmorency.
You just became unemployed.
Tell me more about the new contract.
He found the walkie-talkie,
he'll be more suspicious than ever.
As soon as he leaves home,
stick to him like glue
Everything's ready. He knows
the metro well.
We'll shadow him step by step.
And no slip-ups this time.
You're in charge of the cars.
You'll be in the metro,
with 50 men and 20 auxiliaries.
Each man carries a transmitter.
When he sees Costello,
he switches it this way.
When he's out of sight,
he switches it that way.
The next contact does the same.
I'll be here, keeping the cars in touch
with what's happening below.
Go on.
- Car 11 checking in.
- Car 13 checking in.
- Car 38 checking in.
- Car 41 checking in.
That's it, contact established.
Contact broken, he got off at Jourdain.
Re-establish contact at all costs.
A car to Place des Fêtes station,
to Botzaris, to Pré Saint-Gervais.
Message received.
Car 167 to Botzaris station.
Car 16 to Place des Fêtes.
Car 39 to Pré Saint-Gervais. Over.
Wrong platform.
What's happened?
- What?
- We lost him.
He shook off an auxiliary.
I'm covering all exits.
I don't think he's left yet.
- Enough auxiliaries?
- I'm expecting more.
Some cars aren't here yet.
Let's hope he picks an exit
that's already covered.
- The platforms?
- They're OK.
I'm warning you, this is the last time.
All right.
- You could hear me?
- I think so. I had a feeling...
Maybe I just wanted you to come.
Any problems?
473.5
01:32:31,987 --> 01:32:32,786
No.
Because of me?
474.5
01:32:38,066 --> 01:32:38,787
No.
I've never had any problems
because of you.
Did they give you a hard time?
476.5
01:32:50,346 --> 01:32:51,187
No.
What about you?
Do you need me?
478.5
01:32:59,947 --> 01:33:01,000
No.
Yes, you do.
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do, Jeff?
Nothing.
481.5
01:33:20,908 --> 01:33:21,588
Nothing.
Don't worry. I'll arrange everything.
What do you want?
You got your 4 million?
484.5
01:34:34,471 --> 01:34:35,230
Yes.
You accept the new contract?
485.5
01:34:38,992 --> 01:34:39,791
Yes.
You shouldn't have come here.
I'm just leaving.
Don't stay here.
Why, Jeff?
I've been paid for it.
You had a narrow escape.
Without us, you'd be dead.
No.
