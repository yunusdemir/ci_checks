Hey, you want to hear the story maniac
with machetes?
Let's hear it.
I do not know.
Maybe that's too hard for you.
- No. No, no.
- No, let me, Dave. Tell us the story.
Well, why not.
That happened 15 years ago.
I was a boy who worked
the club, Phil Coletti.
And on a night-
that's about
a beautiful woman enters the club,
and asks if he wants to go in the jungle.
He says, "Yes, why not?"
And go.
And whereas in the jungle ...
lights are removed from the club ...
start to put all sorts of questions ...
believes that if local stories ...
with voodoo, zombies.
He and i do not really worry.
She climbs on and starts, and his job.
But something does not seem out of place Colette.
But I do not see anything.
It was dark and I and sees the job.
But then, boom!
A lightning illuminates the island and
at that moment ...
Coletti looks around and sees that there
only that it was in the middle of the cemetery ...
and that others were watching him ...
but sees that making love to a corpse.
One cold, dirty ...
and from the pit.
And they say that ...
Phil Coletti he went calm
hut attendant tombs ...
has found a machete ...
and cut off hundreds of pieces members.
And they say took that same machete ...
and has cut his own dick and
ran screaming through the jungles.
No one had seen him after that.
But from then on ...
Phil Coletti was known as ...
Machete Phil.
You're saying a damblagiu
now through our walk around?
All I'm saying is that I'm not going
alone in the jungle.
Because you can hear
I have heard ...
complaining ...
"Where is my penis?
Where is my penis? "
And that was me!
You're an asshole,
Putman.
- And someone has put it tonight?
- Hey, Pete.
I did.
He saw someone
Rolo, Stacy or Kelly?
And probably through the jungle fuck there.
I need someone to
Luau Night take care of tomorrow.
Yeah, sure.

What, a few Anana and i.
- Yes, great. Sam, you want Luau Night?
- Sure.

and all and I will make.
That sounds good.

Asking too much?
Make your invitations for sex.
Not all the shows and the bad.
Hola, Peenalop!

- Well, 200 points.
- God!
You're dead, labex! Puþulicã!

It's one of your cntecele.
What the hell are you talking about?
One of my songs?
Yes, your album
"Sea Shanties and Wet Panties. '"
- 1978?
- Let me see your hands, folks!
What does that song have to do with these?
The name of the song is "Naughty Cal."
- Naughty Cliff. Naughty Carlos.
- Naughty Horse!
Shit.
That was written on the board yesterday.
I did not know where he is.
How to know among their songs?
Nor do I remember to be
That album did well?
It was '78.
We were all taken to the raft.
There were some crazy times in 1978.
Man that I spent.
"Up to kite?
"He fell and broke his blade?
That's Carlos.
Then "lost in the maze,"
just like Cliff.
And that kills people after
some fucking lyrics?
- This is crazy!
- Peter.
What is the song?
Has any special significance?
No.
It is a fishermen's huts. Cal's Naughty
is a cowboy in the water ...
and Bongo Tokeyand
are his friends.
And they go on this adventure,
to find Atlantis or something.
Listen to other lines
see what happens.
To put it backwards.
Listen.
I mean what the hell?
Orca and octopus?
That is, victims are
or crimunalii?
Our lives depend on interpretations
the stupidest song I've heard.
Please do not abstain.
Say what you think.
There are sensitive.
I gained only about

Let's see how it ends.
Jeez.

"It makes you (you) Yu. '"
He wants to warn guests.
Hank!
Why do a fashion show?
Because it's fashion week!
Look what happened to Yu! Remember
"Do your job or die"?
So I put a smile on their faces ...
and go there and do our job.
- Do you understand? Lars, you follow. Let's go.
- Roger, Pete.
Lars Brunckhorst.
Lars sport for Pleasure Poncho.
At a price of anything.
Thanks, Lars.
I mean, I do not trust the new guy.
You're right.
It all began when he came here, right?
- Sam is not Lars or one of us.
- Look, Jenny.
- I know why you defend.
- Pajamas! Come on, move!
- Putman, pillow.
- Putman Livingston, I presume.
It even Lord
Little Lord Fauntleroy!
Pip, pip! Tallyho!
I understand.
In that song ...
Naughty Knight sings about the evil octopus.
Look at Putman!
Putman is the octopus.
- Hello?
- Dave, go and play with the curtain.
No. We can not ignore that song.
How about Carlos and Cliff?
But that Hank was buried in the sand as
treasure of the song?
Okay, maybe the octopus ...
is the next person to die.
How do you kill someone with an octopus?
Octopus said backwards is "supotco."
Juan does not mean anything in Spanish?
"Supotco? No.
The word for shoe is zapato.
Shoe.
Only it seems to me that
looks like an octopus?
- Vine.
- What have I missed?
It seems that someone will be
killed for a shoe.
What would have to turn our attention to the boats?
- Good idea.
- Jenny, let's look together.
Putman.
- Why do not we go?
- Are you insane?
There I go with you in the jungle.
If you're gonna break killer
neck like a stick.
Well, stay on shore.
We have no reason to go into the jungle.
The boats are probably covered with sticks.
Or branches.
Thank you.
Have not got any weapons?
I do not need any weapons.
I piss on that.
I take a machete.
Thanks for doing this, Lars.
You're very brave.
Be careful, okay?
Cheers, Putman.
You are watching you, Mr. Miyagi.
I think you are stressed
to cook for everyone ...
but I think that you will be fine, yes.
I bet you've seen Yu and Kelly.
And the rest is just common sense.
Like now ...

- You know.
We look out the window.
Squid?
It is an aphrodisiac, Juan.
What is it?
Are not you afraid of a little octopus, huh?
Thank you.
When you finish here ...
I want to come and find me ...
because I'm gonna throw
tentacles around you.
Well.
No way.
Think about it, the octopus.
It is a strange chick.
Still does not show that it is criminal.
There is only one way to find out.
Do not be afraid.
I want our first time to be wonderful.
If you are the killer ...
I do not kill me.
Or at least not hurt.
With your moves are sure you can.
We're here because we believe
that it is criminal.
I'll bite.
- I hope not too much.
- I like Juan.
When we first met I was wondering,
"Who the hell is this guy?
Any local person here, "
Mmm.
- I was honest with you.
- That ...
not go to Oral Roberts?
I mean ...
I wanted to forget the past when I came here.
What are my up a nun?
I-
I've never been in a place like this.
The libertine.
Juan, I spent all
life in the gym.
I like to have fun like everyone else.
My coach would kill me if they find out.
I would like a giddy hunt.
- It frightened
- Wait.
- You gymnast?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Not ass!
No!
Be right back.
Well.
Eh, still not sure.
I need a few hours.
Gaozarule!
Now not only do you babardesti.
How would you be if you were sitting
sex in the closet as I do?
It would be a good idea.
Coming!
What are you going to Jenny?
You know, Put ...
during the Sung dynasty, was
Po Tong Tsu a great teacher.
And he said something very smart:
"If you love something, let him go.
-If he turns to keep "
- Do you f. ..
It is a postcard.
Trying to help.
I like you, right?
But I have my guns.
What kind of man would be if I sit and
I look how I steal?
Do not underestimate me, Lars.
I know things you do not know.
Well, Lars,
see what you can.
Look what I found.
Yes, bright.
Hey.
I knew it.
Fool.
Lars?
Lord!
No!
No!
- You!
- Good love.
Now get your bag that
on the head and give us a kiss.
- What?
- Advantage, Putman.
Putman!
Putman!
Putman! Wake up, Putman.
It's a dream! Just a dream, Putman.
Goodbye.
Look.
The ship!
Mommy! We found the boat!
Hold your hats.
Does not go anywhere.
- What did you do with the propeller, man?
- I have done nothing.
That is the one that shot him Carlos.
We can send someone on the island.
- We have plenty of strong guys.
- Not a chance.
The current trip takes you.
You drink your own pee
in less than 20 hours.
- Where is Putman?
- Not here?
He left last night.
He fled into the jungle.
It "ran" you mean "I killed him?"
Do not we realize that the missing
Putman if you come back with a boat?
- Sam, is ridiculous.
- What is ridiculous?
Look. Putman got a freak on
middle of the night and fled into the jungle.
I was in your room last night, Lars.
Mark David Chapman is a
Pete's shrine.
- Unbelievable!
- I am a fan.
A fan?
Dude, you loony!
Nobody was killed last night ...
because Lars
was in the jungle to kill Putman.
I would not harm a person, right?
Do not believe in violence.
Touching other people like to feel better.
We must-
"You're the fun police!
- Juan!
What the hell? Stand easy!
Do not quarrel!
If we resist evening
ship will be here tomorrow.
We'll be fine.
So let's drink a glass ...
-And get drunk.
- I do not want to get drunk, Pete!
I want to know the trick with Lars?
You come here and everyone begins to die.
There are bound to say nothing of the pig
Fun! You want to arrest me as a joke?
Then get a mandate joke!
Until then ...
I do not get out the way!
Hai!
Jenny, you know that I am not the killer, right?
Lars is not so bad, right?
- I'll get some newspapers.
- Yes.
Glass does the phrase "fixed target"?
No.
- Boy, this is wrong.
- Listen, Jenny ...
if he is the killer
then we have the room.
And if not then at least he'll know.
A putit?
Worse than hell.
Shit!
- May stay here?
- Sure.
I only just started.
Free drink to that which I catch!
Shit.
Oh, God!
You have answered the prayers.
- Gaozarule!
- No, I'm not.
There are couple-only
What the hell?
- What?
- Something I passed leg.
I mean, there's something here.
- What?
- No, wait!
It's just my huge tool.
- God.
- There was something wrong?
Dirk out of the pool!
No kidding!
- Faster!
- That's what I call quality service!
Now!
Out of the pool!
Hey, help!
Putman!
Live!
You took me in his arms, Jenny.
I suppose that all men
the island are dead.
You must get out of here!
Dirk is dead!
He was electrocuted in the pool!
Really? What was the expression on his face?
I think I screamed like hell.
You're scaring me.
I want to know if
smoke out his ears.
Is there anything wrong with that?
Putman, where were you?
We ran in circles through this jungle.
Well you're not dead.
You must go to Pete's cottage ...
- And to start the backup generator.
- Wait!
If Dirk had just been killed,
Lars then can be criminal!
Be the stage.
Can be a little nervous.
Lars!
Lars, we are here!
Stop stirring, Jen.
There was no way.
It is too big.
You have to find Pete.
Pete!
Pete?
Pete?
You're here, Pete?
Peter!
We need the key generator.
- Damn!
- It takes someone at the door?
- Who is?
- Who's there?
Hey!
I think it is a problem with the lights!
Maybe that
Lars came after us here.
We are not sure that is Lars.
What is with you and Lars?
I mean, let's see.
You had sex with Rolo, and he is dead.
You and Cliff, right?
It's dead.
I did and Juan
and Pete, and they are not dead.
Heck, Jen!
I'm the only one?
Let's go back.
What should we do-
Do not give so great, well, Sam?
As soon as you finish with
"I do not have to die," Juan.
Look for that letter
Encarnación prison?
- What the hell?
- Why are you doing, man?
"Juan does not show signs
bizarre behavior ...
"Which brought him in this institution.
"I think rehabilitated ...
and will be part of
d.vs. staff, successful "
- What did you do, Juan?
- Nothing, Jenny.
What you did I?
Costa Rica-Prison
at the bottom there you burn bad.
- Juan, you must know.
- What did you do, Juan?
El Chupacabra!
- Hey!
- No!
Oh, God!
- How could you do that?
- Wait!
I did not do that.
There are criminal.
So what is this?
Want to know what I did?
Juan Castillo ...
was in jail ...
having sex with a goat.
Okay?
What do you say?
I lived on the farm!
And I was alone!
I was-
We were two stupid kids.
No, it was Juan.
It was Dave ...
huh?
You wanted him for what he did
your parents.
I did not know any ...
is that David's parents ...
were being trampled to death
a concert of Coconut Pete.
What the hell is wrong with you, Putman?
Everyone knows that Dave's parents
were killed at a show with Pete.
Well you brought it up.
What?
Believe you that I could kill him?
Petey is my uncle.
all you saw as a ...
singer island's melons ...
and a patron of the establishment, but ...
but how many know that she was afraid of dogs ...
and that he liked the rosemary?
How did you know that ...
was a Christian and that smelled like oranges?
Yes, all good and fine, David.
But I bet you ...
inherited the island.
- The island is already mine.
- What?
Pete gave me last week.
It came back on the road
place where he was.
Form a supergroup-
Billy Squier and Eddie Money!
Don Henley played drums!
It would have been cool.
He wants to sell the island to
military bombing tests.
But I told myself that I can do with it.
Lars.
No! No!
Pete.
Oh, God!
Pete!
Bravo, Lars, bravo.
Very convincing.
- Asshole!
- Lars! No, stop!
- To close it again.
- No!
Stop!
Do not shut anyone!
We will stay together in one room!
The ship will come tomorrow.
We go to the club, guests gather ...
and wait until morning.
And we survive the night, right?
Damn, man!
Lars mreg not anywhere.
I do not go anywhere cuJuan.
What kind of man having sex with a goat?
We used a condom.
You told me that they are
against your faith.
Ehhh, you must find Peenalop.
I'm sure you understand.
If you get close to my cottage your head!
Let's get outta here, Dave. Hai
Dave, get outta here, man.
I think not.
Jenny, you make the biggest mistake.
I'm not sure what happened ...
with all that dishonest business jungle.
But I embrace your dreams.
I think there are safer one.
The plan has gone to hell.
Even left us a torch.
Jenny? Jenny?
I think I know where the generator.
Damn!
Perhaps I took the sword.
I do not care if I perform a
bamboo spear, this one to assholes
- Listen.
- Do not keep silent!
I'm tired of fleeing-
I thought that we have currently.
Dave?
Dave. Dave?
Lord!
I am!
Damn!
The lock is broken!
It's there.
Quick, under the bed
quickly, come!
Not one to come.
What are you doing?
Lars, what are you doing?
Lars, please!
Hai!
Lars, go!
Coming!
Oh, God!
Coming!
Damn!
So you escaped through the window?
Why not do that forever?
That is a fat joke?
What the hell?
What the hell, Jenny?
Putman!
You were?
- What was I?
- Back, Putman!
You think I am the murderer.
What fun.
What are you doing here?
I came to say-
Pervert.
Really, Jenny, there is an explanation for it.
Mean-
It seemed such a good reminder
I know how good you look
red, and this small-
- No!
- God!
- Where is key?
- Do not know.
Lock the door!
Lock is broken!
Broken?
Did you handcuffed to the bed of death,
The damn slut!
- Sorry.
- I can not stay mad at you, Jenny.
Hurry!
Give me the racquet and balls!
- Quick!
- Run!
Get out!
Machete Phil!
I knew it!
- Go, dear Jen ..
- No!
Namaste.
Go-n p.. Mine!
Come on.
Sorry.
You!
I need to know that you are!
- Do not surprise me at all.
- Hell, Putman!
- Who is?
- You can not escape without a fight.
But there is still wide, set-
Soap, please.
Hey!
Nice helmet, Lars!
It's about time to come!
Pour!
Lord!
That's blood!
- What the hell?
- God!
You will all die!
Help!
Penelope!
Where is Juan?
I have not seen all night.
What the hell is happening?
Juan! Juan!
- Wait.
- What are you doing?
- Leave me alone!
- Where the hell have you been?
I'm looking for Peenalop.
Why look at me?
Because you have gone half an hour ago
and now appear bloody.
Because I found Putman.
- Is dead.
- Sam!
- Mud bath!
- Let's go, Peenalop.
- Oh, no.
- What?
- Get out.
- What?
Get out now!
You know that I can hold their breath ...
3 minutes and 33 seconds?
Nobody suspects the fun police.
- Like hell I always suspected you have.
- I did not.
You're shit!
It is the story of gagiul fire
Camp Machete Phil, free type tool.
No, that's just an old story of fire.
Why are you angry?
It's just a story!
I got up.
I am not Machete Phil.
Models I am Sam.
Sam, why do that?
I remember like it was yesterday.
Rolo I asked some grass,
and I said no.
So I followed him into the jungle.
- And what do you think I saw?
- No.
His grass.
My Grass!
A bag full.
And those two sluts smoking the ...
although he said he does not.
So-
No, wait, is not it.
I learned that Pete gave Dave island.
Yes. That's it.
There was no grass.
However it was not nice.
It was the island that gave
lu this ox-head!
All night in delirium
pig dog!
But I?
I deserve it!
The best employee of this place!
Dave is destroyed.
This is my home.
Pete believed that there are only a clown.
I have made you do the job, right?
I have pretty good skills, do not you?
We have made an idiot to figure out that song.
Who is the orca?
Who is the octopus?
I am the walrus!
Get out of here! Now!
I can not take much.
Trying to sleep!
Try Panda snoring!
I can not reach.
I can handle.
We have an orgasm a few minutes.
Valley!
- Do not leave!
- I'll be fine.
Go away, we will have trouble.
Come on.
- Back to the club!
- Are you crazy?
It is the safest building on the island.
There we drink!
Baba-Boobie!
- Peenalop!
- Juan!
Oh, God!
Watching us.
It is safer with him. Let's go!
Let's go!
Hold the gate!
Oh, God!
Stop!
Stop!
What are you doing?
- You will not succeed!
- Sam! Please!
Watch out!
Louder!
Can not breathe!
Penelope!
Get up.
Juan! Juan! Juan, get up!
Juan above.
Hurry!
It is not a party to
not break someone jacuzzi.
- Lars!
Fun ...
s over.
What happened to fall?
So!
- No!
- It's impossible!
- What do we do?
- Can we lost in the jungle.
- In the jungle?
- Can I go through it!
Hai!
- Faster!
- Go!
I know where that leads!
Let's go!
Lord!
That was your big plan?
We can be successful, flow.
Okay, now listen.
I know this sounds disgusting, but ...
you keep your feet jump
close and glued pieces.
Otherwise water will enter through the ass hole
and will make meteor sling.
Yucky!
Where are you?
- Walk your hands, Juan.
- Coming!
Jesus!
Who is this girl?
It is ...
My girlfriend.
- You see?
- I saw it.
Oh, my asshole!
- What did you see?
- Randy Rumrunner.
Failed.
Went to the bottom.
Juan, you can go to the bottom to take the propeller?
We can make Smilin'Smuggler.
- It's done, my friend.
- Come on, come on.
Hai!
Juan!
- Hai.
- In the boat.
Lord!
Where the hell is Juan?
- Juan? Juan?
- Juan, where are you?
- Jesus, bleeding.
- I have no shit.
- Let it be seen on the other.
- O to mount.
Come on.
Juan!
I'm fine.
I can not imagine a better way to die.
Just remember, Peenalop.
I love you.
! By Carajo mierda!
I love you!
Maybe ...
before I go ...
a kiss.
No.
I mean if you and Jenny to be able ...
kiss you.
Always ...
I wanted ...
to see that.
- God!
- Juan!
Juan!
Hai!
Pig dog!
Hai!
Shit!
Turn!
- Lars, what are you doing?
- Trust me.
- Lars, stop!
- Go!
Yes!
- We approach the dock!
- I know.
Yes!
- Easy.
- Okay.
You must cut the rope that.
Go, Jenny!
Hai!
Yes!
Let's get the hell out of here.
- Go!
- Go!
Die!
Pig dog!
I'll probably give out of
pacifists club now.
Or at least you will ask nicely to leave.
Tian, you ...
Paradise Point.
Let's go, Peenalop.
