YOU KNOW, I'M LEARNING SLOWLY
IN MY CRUISING CAREER...
THAT YOU CANNOT
EXPECT PEOPLE...
TO TRANSFORM
IN AN AFTERNOON.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO
REWRITE THEIR SOULS...
AND REDO EVERY DAY
THAT THEY'VE LIVED THUS FAR...
BEFORE THEY COME ON
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS,
AND YET I EXPECT THAT.
I EXPECT THE TOTAL
TRANSFORMATION OF THEIR LIFE,
THE ENTIRE REWRITE
OF THEIR SOULS.
I AM FIGHTING MINUTE TO MINUTE,
EVERY MOMENT
THAT THEY'RE ON THE BUS,
FOR EVERY DAY THEY'VE LIVED
THUS FAR TO SEEM AS...
A ABSTRACT WRECKAGE...
THAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED
BUT IS PROBABLY A DELUSION,
AND THAT THIS IS
THE FIRST REAL DAY OF THEIR LIVES.
<i>NOT TO GENERALIZE.</i>
<i>AGAIN, WITH EVERY BUSLOAD,</i>
<i>THERE'S INTERNATIONALITY...</i>
<i>AND THEREFORE DIFFERENT
GRADATIONS...</i>
<i>OF CRUISING MANIFESTATION.</i>
<i>BUT I, UH--</i>
I FIND MYSELF
CONNECTING...
WITH SOME OF THEM
MORE THAN OTHERS.
<i>- IT IS RAINING?</i>
- KIND OF.
- HELLO.
<i>- HELLO.</i>
WHAT'S UP, BENITEZ?
<i>- WE'RE LEAVING.</i>
- WE'RE LEAVING?
- OH, IT'S RAINING.
- NO!
IT'S NOT RAINING.
GREENWICH VILLAGE,
ONE OF THOSE RARE DISTRICTS...
THAT OCCURS ONCE IN A WHILE
IN HUMAN HISTORY.
FEAR, A BASIC THEME
OF ALL OF OUR LIVES.
CONSTANTLY AFRAID ALONG THE
STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE,
UNDER THREAT
OF ASSASSINATION,
AND THE ASSASSINS
ARE OUR DREAMS TRIUMPHANT,
THE BY-PRODUCT OF SUCH A PURSUIT--
CREATIVITY AND RADICALIZATION--
WHICH ARE THE FURTHER THEMES
OF GREENWICH VILLAGE LINEAGE.
RIGHT NOW YOU ARE
SIX AND A HALF BLOCKS...
FROM WHERE THOMAS PAINE DIES.
PAINE, THE INFIDEL
REVOLUTIONARY,
AUTHOR OF <i>THE COMMON SENSE</i>
<i>AND</i> <i>THE CRISIS,</i>
TWO OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL
POLITICAL PAMPHLETS...
OF AMERICAN HISTORY,
BOTH WRITTEN DURING
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
THOMAS PAINE RETURNS
TO GROVE STREET...
TO DIE IN A SOMEWHAT DISGRACE...
SOON AFTER BEING IMPRISONED
BY ROBESPIERRE IN PARIS...
DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.
YOU ARE THREE AND A HALF BLOCKS
FROM WHERE MARK TWAIN MOVES--
RIGHT AFTER HIS WIFE PASSES
AWAY-- ONTO WEST TENTH STREET.
TWAIN MOVING AT THAT TIME
A FEW DOORS DOWN...
FROM O. HENRY.
FOUR AND A HALF BLOCKS
FROM WHERE EDGAR ALLAN POE...
HAS A SHORT-TERM RESIDENCE...
DEEP IN THE HEART
OF HIS OPIUM ADDICTION.
ALTHOUGH HE HAS MANY RESIDENCES
THROUGHOUT THAT DELUSIONAL TIME,
HE WRITES "THE RAVEN"
AT 61 CARMINE STREET.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE...
THE AMERICAN NOVELIST
HENRY JAMES IS BORN...
AND FROM WHERE EDITH WHARTON...
SPENDS MUCH OF HER
ARISTOCRATIC CHILDHOOD...
ON WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK
ITSELF.
AND THIS...
IS SEVENTH AVENUE SOUTH
IN FRONT OF YOU,
THE MODERN SEMI-EXPRESSWAY
OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.
SIX BLOCKS FROM THE PROVINCETOWN
PLAYHOUSE WHERE EUGENE O'NEILL...
BEGINS HIS EARLY
PLAYWRITING CAREER.
SIX BLOCKS FROM WHERE
HENRY MILLER DECIDES...
HE HATES NEW YORK CITY FOREVER...
AND MOVES TO PARIS.
TWO BLOCKS FROM
WHERE WILLA CATHER LIVES.
THREE BLOCKS FROM
WHERE E.E CUMMINGS LIVES.
THREE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
SHERWOOD ANDERSON LIVES.
FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE H.L. MENCKEN LIVES,
FOUR BLOCKS FROM WHERE
THEODORE DREISER LIVES.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
NATHANAEL WEST LIVES.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM
WHERE D.H. LAWRENCE...
LIVES LASCIVIOUSLY.
FOUR BLOCKS FROM
WHERE JACK REED LIVES,
AUTHOR OF <i>TEN DAYS
THAT SHOOK THE WORLD</i>,
THE FIRST AND ONLY AMERICAN TO
BE BURIED IN THE KREMLIN WALL.
BEFORE THAT HAPPENS
TO THE RADICAL JACK REED,
HE LIVES YOUTHFULLY
AT 42 WASHINGTON SQUARE.
HIS NEIGHBOR ACROSS
THE HALL, MAX EASTMAN,
EDITOR OF <i>THE MASSES</i> NEWSPAPER,
PUBLISHED TWO BLOCKS AWAY
IN A BASEMENT,
THE MAJOR COMMUNIST PUBLICATION
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.
TWO BLOCKS FROM WHERE
ARTHUR MILLER, THE PLAYWRIGHT,
CONTEMPLATES SUICIDE...
AND FROM WHERE JIM MORRISON
DOES THE SAME.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
THE POET DYLAN THOMAS DIES.
HIS FAMOUS LAST WORDS:
"I JUST HAD MY 16th MARTINI".
HE LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS...
IN THE WHITE HORSE
TAVERN ON HUDSON STREET...
AND NEVER REGAINS IT.
FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE
DOROTHY PARKER WRESTLES...
WITH ALCOHOLISM AND
THE DEFEATS OF A LIFETIME...
AND FAILS.
<i>NEW YORK CITY
IS A LIVING ORGANISM.
<i>IT EVOLVES, IT DEVOLVES.
IT FLUCTUATES AS A LIVING ORGANISM.
SO MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH NEW YORK CITY...
IS AS VITRIOLIC AS
THE RELATIONSHIP WITH MYSELF...
AND WITH ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING,
WHICH MEANS THAT IT CHANGES
EVERY MILLISECOND,
THAT IT'S IN
CONSTANT FLUCTUATION.
THIS WINTER I REALLY FELT
LIKE WE WERE GETTING A DIVORCE.
AND I WAS CERTAINLY
THE LOSER OF THAT DIVORCE.
THERE WAS ANGER.
I WAS OVERWHELMED.
I WAS REEMERGED
INTO MY OWN NAIVETE.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE HOW ANGRY
THE CITY WAS WITH ME.
IT SEEMED LIKE A VINDICTIVE WOMAN,
TO BE LIKE NO REASON WHATSOEVER,
JUST BY THE PURE RAGE
OF ITS OWN EXISTENCE.
BECAUSE THE CONCRETE SETTLED.
BECAUSE THE TERRA-COTTA
HAD BEEN METICULOUSLY CARVED.
BECAUSE SOME OF THE BUILDINGS
ARE HIGHER THAN OTHERS.
THE ANGER, THE INFERIORITY,
THAT SOME OF
THE SHORTER BUILDINGS FEEL, I FELT.
I SUDDENLY WAS NOT WELCOME
ON THIS ISLAND ANYMORE.
AND THE CITY AND I HAVE HAD...
A REEMERGENCE OF SOME KIND
IN THE SUMMER,
MAYBE BECAUSE I WAS ABLE
TO REFUEL MY CRUISE A LITTLE BIT...
BY WORKING LABORIOUSLY...
AND CRAWLING
MY WAY BACK ONTO THE ISLAND.
BECAUSE PERHAPS I PAID
PROPER RESPECT TO IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY THE CITY WAS SO
ANGRY WITH ME DURING THIS WINTER.
I'M JUST GLAD THAT IT'S NOT QUITE
AS ANGRY WITH ME RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK
TOO SOON, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
LIKE I SAID, THE RELATIONSHIP
SEEMS TO CHANGE,
AS ANY HUMAN
RELATIONSHIP WOULD...
AND WITH ANY LIVING THING.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF THIS
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
IT'S MORE ON THE LINES OF A CYCLOPS.
SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF IT
IS A LIVING ORGANISM,
PERHAPS IT'S MORE ON THE
LEVEL OF A SCINTILLATING,
STREAMLINED MERMAID...
WHO SINGS TO ME AT NIGHT.
I GUESS I AM RIGHT NOW.
JOEL.
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO CHECK IN.
I DID THE 8:45 PICKUP.
HELLO. GRAY LINE.
<i>YOU CAN STAY OUT THERE</i>
<i>ONE MINUTE.</i>
YEAH, I'LL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.
LET ME SEE IF MISS GALL
IS HERE. HOLD ON.
<i>THE LOWER LOOP IN THE
DOWNTOWN DIRECTION...
<i>NOW BOARDING THE BUS
OUTSIDE TO THE RIGHT.
WE NEED A TOUR GUIDE
FOR A SECOND SECTION DOWNTOWN.
HANG ON.
WAIT FOR THE SECOND SECTION.
<i>I THINK OF EVERY
DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP...
<i>AS ANOTHER LOOP
TOWARDS MY DEATH.
THAT IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF THE DOUBLE-DECKER LOOP--
EACH LOOP AS A CONTINUOUS
AND INDIVIDUALIZED, UM,
SEARCH FOR PERFECTION.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE...
THAT TO TELL THE HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE STORY
OF THE WORLD.
FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS.
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
PEOPLE WORK...
INSIDE THE WORLD TRADE
CENTER BUILDINGS...
DAILY.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
BUILDINGS HAVE THEIR OWN ZIP CODE.
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
TOWERS THEMSELVES,
BUILT TO SWAY IN HEAVY WINDS
A FOOT AND A HALF IN ANY DIRECTION.
SOMETHING
TO CONSIDER.
SO WHAT'S UP, TIM?
HOW'S THE GRAY LINE?
- GRAY LINE IS LIKE--
- APPLE'S BETTER, RIGHT?
YEAH, DAMN RIGHT.
APPLE WAS LIKE A LIVING CARNIVAL.
WE WERE COSSACKS,
AND WE TOOK WHAT WE WANTED.
WE THREW PEOPLE OVERBOARD,
OFF THE BUS, IF WE DIDN'T LIKE THEM.
IT WAS OUR TERRITORY.
THE CITY BELONGED TO US
AT APPLE. -APPLE IS BETTER.
- ABSOLUTELY.
- NUMBER ONE.
I HAD MORE OF AN ERECTION
WHEN I WORKED AT APPLE.
I JUST FELT LIKE
SO MUCH MORE OF A MAN.
YOU KNOW APPLE
IS BETTER, RIGHT? -YEAH!
I WANTED TO HEAR YOU
SAY YES.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO HEAR.
I WANT TO HEAR YOU SAY YES.
FOR GOD'S SAKES.
- NUMBER ONE.
- I'M GONNA PROBABLY GET FIRED.
I'LL PROBABLY BE HUNG
FROM A FLAGPOLE SOMEWHERE,
BUT APPLE IS BETTER.
APPLE IS BETTER!
I THINK THAT THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF APPLE TOURS,
IN THAT SENSE,
WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARTACUS.
SPARTACUS WAS ONE OF THE GREAT
TOUR GUIDES OF THE ANCIENT WORLD.
HE WOULD HAVE FIT IN
AT APPLE TOURS.
BRUTUS AND HIS CONSPIRATORS...
RIGHT BEFORE THE
ASSASSINATION OF CAESAR,
THEY WERE APPLE TOUR GUIDES.
BUT LIKE WILLY WONKA
IS A GRAY LINE TOUR GUIDE.
ALSO ONE OF MY GREAT
INSPIRATIONS ON THE TOUR ROUTE,
BUT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THERE.
ATTILA THE HUN...
WOULD HAVE BEEN A GOOD
APPLE DISPATCHER.
WHEREAS VIRGIL
IN THE <i>INFERNO,</i>
I THINK WOULD HAVE WORKED
FOR GRAY LINE.
HOW MANY YEAR NOW? -LIKE FOUR
YEARS I'VE BEEN DOING THE TOUR.
NO, FIVE. DON'T SAY FOUR,
PLEASE. -FIVE YEARS.
YEAH! BY THE TIME
YOU WORKED AT GRAY LINE,
YOU GOT THAT TROLLEY BUS
AND YOU GO TO CENTRAL PARK.
- I REMEMBER THE DAMN TROLLEY.
- I WORKED ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER.
I REMEMBER THAT. -LATER ON
YOU COME WORK AT APPLE.
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S BEEN
FIVE YEARS OF THIS, GOING IN CIRCLES.
YOU'VE BEEN STANDING
ON THIS SIDEWALK FOR FIVE YEARS.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
OH, LOOK, STRAIGHT UP.
THAT'S A GREAT VIEW.
THE WHITE TERRA-COTTA
STRAIGHT AHEAD.
THAT'S THE ONE BUILDING THAT LOUIS
SULLIVAN DESIGNED...
FOR NEW YORK CITY.
HMM.
LOOK AT THE METICULOUSNESS.
THAT STRONG VERTICAL LAUNCH
IN THE FACADE...
IS TYPICAL
OF THE SULLIVAN MILIEU.
YOU KNOW, TERRA-COTTA...
BECOMES ONE OF THE
MAJOR MATERIALS...
OF NEW YORK CITY ARCHITECTURE.
IT'S LIKE
A SAND-BAKED BRICK.
IT'S NOT QUITE GRANITE,
AND IT'S NOT QUITE BRICK.
IT WALKS
THE MAINSTREAM MIDDLE.
IT WAS EXCELLENT
FOR NEW YORK ARCHITECTURE...
BECAUSE IT COULD HANG OFF
THE SKELETONS OF THE BUILDINGS.
IT'S MUCH LIGHTER THAN STONE.
THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH,
BETWEEN STONE AND TERRA-COTTA...
THAT STRIKES ME THE MOST...
IS THAT TERRA-COTTA REFLECTS THE
SUNLIGHT, AND STONE ABSORBS IT.
YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNCY LIGHT
ALONG THIS BUILDING.
WHEN I SEE TERRA-COTTA LIKE
THIS, IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL...
LIKE I'M SENSELESSLY RUNNING...
THROUGH A MEADOW OR
HIGH GRASSLAND AREA NUDE,
CHASING A WOMAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE WHO'S ENTIRELY NUDE.
IT'S JUST THE MOST RAW
AND PRIMORDIAL CHASE.
TWO NUDE HUMAN BEINGS RUNNING
THROUGH GRASSLAND MARSH AREA.
AS YOU MOVE UP THE BUILDING,
CAN'T YOU FEEL THE
UNDULATIONS OF HER CURVATURE?
THE--
OHH! YES!
YES!
TH-THAT SLIGHT GROAN...
THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE
IN THE ACT OF INTERCOURSE.
THE, LIKE, "UHH!"
LIKE THE SOMEWHAT DYING GRUNT
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN GRUNTING...
IN THE STORMS
OF HER OWN MALAISE.
YOU CAN FEEL IT IN THE
METICULATIONS OF THE CORNICE LINES
OF THE TERRA-COTTA.
THAT'S WHY THE TERRA-COTTA
IS IMPORTANT TO ME.
IT'S THE "UHH,"
THE "UHH" MOMENTS OF LIFE.
UHH! UHH!
YES! YES!
OH, GOD, PLEASE!
THE BEGGING PARTS OF LIFE
ON THE LEFT SIDE.
YOU SEE THOSE LION-ESQUE
CHARACTERS WAY UP THERE?
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
PLEASE DON'T STOP.
<i>HELLO. CAN YOU HEAR ME
IN THE BACK?
TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND TREES
ARE PLANTED,
TEN AND A HALF MILLION CARTLOADS
OF TOPSOIL IMPORTED...
AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILES
OF DRAINAGE PIPES LAID,
AND THESE ARE
THE BASIC INGREDIENTS...
OF THE SUPPOSEDLY NATURAL
CREATION...
CALLED CENTRAL PARK.
THERE IS NOTHING NATURAL
ABOUT CENTRAL PARK.
WELCOME.
FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED,
THE ESSENTIAL LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT
OF THIS ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK,
SEES A GROUP OF BOYS PLAYING A
PRIMORDIAL FORM OF BASEBALL...
ON THE LOWER PLAY LAWNS
IN THE 1850s,
AND AT THAT MOMENT OUTLAWS
BASEBALL FROM CENTRAL PARK.
THE MEN WHO BUILD AND DESIGN THIS
PARK ARE TRANSCENDENTALISTS.
TO THEM, CENTRAL PARK IS A
PLACE TO BECOME ONE WITH NATURE,
TO FOCUS ON TREES,
TO SCINTILLATE WITH GRASS,
TO STARE INTO
ONE ANOTHER'S EYES.
NO SWEATING ALLOWED
IN THE ORIGINAL CENTRAL PARK.
NO PERSPIRATION
OF ANY KIND.
ANYONE YOU SEE CONGREGATING
FOR THE BASEBALL GAME ON THE LEFT,
BICYCLING,
ROLLER-BLADING, JOGGING,
THEY ARE NOT
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ANYONE YOU SEE LOUNGING
IN THE SUN,
HAVING A PICNIC
OR KISSING,
THEY <i>ARE</i>
HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.
ACK! <i>"MUCHO" GRACIAS.</i>
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- MUCHAS GRACIAS.
- SAY <i>HOLA</i> TO BUENOS AIRES FOR ME.
¿COMO?
SAY HELLO TO BUENOS AIRES
FOR ME.
- SAY HELLO?
- MM-HMM.
HELLO, YEAH. WHEN YOU
GET TO BUENOS AIRES.
- AH, YES.
- YES. <i>SI.</i>
THANK YOU.
- CIAO.
- BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL. WE'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THE PARK IS BEAUTIFUL.
- YES. THANK YOU. GOOD LUCK.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. CIAO.
- CIAO.
- <i>ADIOS.</i>
STYLE.
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT BIDS.
WERE YOU INTERESTED IN TAKING ONE?
OH, UM, I LOOKED AT
WHAT'S LEFT.
THE ONES I WAS INTERESTED IN WERE
TAKEN. -JUST WANTED TO CHECK.
THE ONLY ONE I WOULD'VE BEEN
INTERESTED IN THAT WASN'T TAKEN...
WAS THAT 34.
BUT THAT'S GOT SUCH AN EARLY
HOTEL PICKUP, AND I-- YOU KNOW.
SO YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED.
- I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
- PICK A BID...
SO YOU'LL KNOW YOU'LL HAVE STEADY
WORK. -TAKE THE DAMN BID, LEVITCH!
YEAH, BUT I WAS TALKING TO TANYA.
THERE'S NO WAY TO REWRITE THE BIDS?
NO REWRITING. -LIKE--
THEY'RE, LIKE, WITH SOLIDITY.
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- TAKE THE BID, TIM.
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T CARE WHEN
YOU'RE UP AT 7:30 IN THE MORNING.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ANYWAY AT 7:00 IN THE MORNING.
NEITHER DO I.
I'M DOIN' IT. YOU GET 20 HOURS
A WEEK. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YEAH, YOU GET 20 HOURS A
WEEK, AND THAT'S ONE THING.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT.
IT'S BEIN' DECIDED NOW.
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT
ANYWAY, TIM. -DON'T BE LATE.
RIGHT. -IT MAY BE
TOO LATE IN A FEW MINUTES.
- REALLY?
- REALLY.
THIS IS LIKE MY LAST FEW
MINUTES TO REALLY DECIDE.
I APPRECIATE IT.
I'LL TAKE THESE NEXT FEW MINUTES...
AND DEEPLY
CONTEMPLATE AND MAKE SURE.
<i>IF I HAVE AN ESSENTIAL GOAL
ON THE CRUISE RIGHT NOW,
I THINK THAT
THE SIMPLEST GOAL...
IS PERHAPS TO--
TO BE ABLE TO EXHIBIT...
THAT I AM THRILLED
TO BE ALIVE...
AND TO BE STILL RESPECTED.
THE MORE SOULFUL OF US--
I SUPPOSE THE BUDDHIST OR
WHATEVER LABEL YOU WANT TO PUT...
ON THOSE EXPERIENCING
FURTHER INDIVIDUALITY...
MIGHT SAY, "LOOK, WHY SHOULD YOU
CARE ABOUT RESPECT FROM OTHERS?
"JUST THE THRILL OF BEING ALIVE
IS YOUR OWN BUSINESS.
YOU CAN DO THAT ALONE
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM".
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
THE CRUISE IS FOR ME.
THE CRUISE IS ABOUT
THE SEARCHINGS...
FOR EVERYTHING WORTHWHILE
IN EXISTENCE.
IT IS ABOUT WALKING INTO THE BAR
AND LUSTING AFTER...
ALL THE WORTHWHILE POSSIBILITIES
OF THE WORLD.
IT IS ABOUT FLESH.
IT IS ABOUT WAVES
UNDULATING.
AND IT IS ABOUT
EXHIBITIONISM.
YOU KNOW, I WANT
TO LOOK AT THE FLOWER...
AND APPRECIATE THE
BEAUTY OF A FLOWER.
SOMEBODY ELSE MIGHT SAY,
"YOU CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER
AND BECOME THE FLOWER.
ISN'T THAT EVEN BETTER?"
BUT THEN I FURTHER
WOULD LOVE IT ON THE CRUISE...
IF I CAN LOOK AT THE FLOWER,
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY
OF THE FLOWER...
AND THEN HAVE THE FLOWER
APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY OF ME.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL
ABOUT CRUISING RIGHT NOW.
YES, BECOMING THE FLOWER WOULD
BE A LOT OF FUN. I CAN DO THAT TOO.
I CAN DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY.
I'M FREE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
I CAN TRY TO BECOME THE FLOWER.
BUT COME THE WEEKEND,
GODDAMN IT,
I WILL APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF THE FLOWER,
AND THEN LIKEWISE,
I WILL STAND EXHIBITIONISTIC,
HAVING THE FLOWER APPRECIATE
THE BEAUTY OF ME.
I THINK HAVING AN INTIMATE
"LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH A FLOWER...
IS FAR MORE PSYCHOTIC
AND RIVETING...
THAN HAVING
"A LOVE AFFAIR"...
WITH SOME OF THE BANAL CREATURES
OF THE HUMAN RACE.
ALTHOUGH I'D BE
INTO THAT TOO.
WELCOME.
THIS IS MY FRIEND RUSSIO'S ROOM,
AND I'M CRASHING HERE RIGHT NOW.
CIVILIZATION...
IS THE AMPUTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO US,
AN EXPERIMENT CREATED...
BY ALIENS...
UNABLE TO HAVE SEX.
CIVILIZATION
IS THE MOLESTATION...
OF EVERYTHING
WE EVER COULD BE,
A GIANT REPRESSION
MELTING INTO SUPPRESSION,
SO THAT YOU NEVER SAY
WHAT YOU MEAN.
CIVILIZATION...
IS BREATHING DOWN OUR NECKS,
SPLITTING US APART.
WE ARE WRECKAGE...
WITH BEATING HEARTS.
CIVILIZATION
IS A CAN OF HAIR SPRAY...
SPRAYING FOR
THE SEASONLESS VEIN...
INTO A HAIR NET
MADE UP OF CURLS,
ONLY EVER MEANT TO BE WAVES.
CIVILIZATION--
GENOCIDE BELIEFS,
MORALISTIC,
SEE-THROUGH LACE BLOUSES,
MISSILES BALLISTIC,
LACKADAISICAL,
MELANCHOLIC RED LIPSTICK.
WHEN ONE FEELS NAUSEOUS
BUT DOESN'T FEEL SICK.
CIVILIZATION
KNEW WHO YOU WERE...
BEFORE YOU WERE EVER BORN,
FORGAVE YOU WHEN YOU THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED FORGIVING.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE...
SURPRISED...
THIS CIVILIZATION.
AND YOU NEVER ONCE FELT...
THAT SENSATION.

THE SUN, ANOTHER GREAT
NEW YORK CITY LANDMARK,
ABOVE YOU ON THE LEFT.
THE ARCH IN THE PARK WILL BE
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE BUS...
WHEN O'SHAYNE SWINGS US
ONTO 14th STREET.
AND 14th STREET IS THE WIDEST

THIS IS WHERE THE ISLAND IS...

AND YOU LIKE FISH.
I HOPE YOU CAN FEEL
THE OMNISCIENCE OF THIS MOMENT,

YEAH, THAT TOO. WOW.
<i>ONE OF THE GREAT TRAGEDIES
<i>OF THIS EXPERIMENT
CALLED CIVILIZATION...
<i>IS THE FACT THAT PEOPLE
HAVE TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
IT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING,
IF I HAD A CHOICE--
OTHER THAN MY ACNE--
I THINK WOULD BE THE FIRST THING
I WOULD REMOVE FROM MY LIFE.
IF I COULD ERASE AN
ASPECT OF MY LIFE,
IT WOULD BE THIS NEED
TO WORK FOR A LIVING.
YOU UNDERSTAND, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE TOUR ITSELF.
WHEN I'M ON THE TOUR ITSELF...
AND I'M SHOWING OTHERS
THE APPRECIATION OF BEAUTY...
AND THE HUGENESS OF ALL THIS,
AND EXPERIENCING THE LASCIVIOUS
VOYEURISM OF THE TOUR BUS,
AND EROTICIZING WOMEN
IN A CONSPIRACY WITH THIS CITY,
AND HAVING SPIRITUAL
TANTRIC CONNECTIONS...
WITH INTERNATIONAL
FLESH CONGREGATIONS,
THIS IS NOT, IN MY MIND,
WORKING FOR A LIVING.
YET, AT THE SAME TIME,
IT IS,
BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE WEEK
WHEN I'VE MADE $200 AFTER TAXES...
AND I HAVE ALL THESE OTHER
PRAGMATIC EXPENSES...
JUST TO KEEP THE CRUISE ALIVE,
YOU KNOW, IT'S RIDICULOUS.
I CERTAINLY WOULD NEVER WAKE UP
EARLY IN THE MORNING AGAIN,
NOT UNLESS I WAS CRUISING.
<i>THE ROADS AROUND YOU NOW...
<i>WILL BECOME CLAUSTROPHOBIC
AND NARROW IN FEELING.
AND THIS WILL NOT JUST BE
YOUR OWN PROJECTION.
THE ROADS <i>ARE</i> CLAUSTROPHOBIC

EXACTLY WHAT THEY TOLD ME TO DO.
GEORGE WAS CRITICIZING
THE LINING.
I'LL GRANT YOU, IT'S NOT IN
GOOD SHAPE. IT NEEDS NEW LINING.
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT SHOULD AFFECT MY, YOU KNOW--
THE COSMETICS ARE A TRICKY THING
ON THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS.
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLE...
...CONFORMIST FASTIDIOUSNESS,
YOU KNOW.
I'M NOT DRESSING TO IMPRESS
MY GRANDMOTHER, YOU KNOW.
I AM, IN A LAUNCHING
AND VITRIOLIC WAY,
TRYING, AT ANY EXPENSE,
TO GRAB THE COLLARS OF PEOPLE...
WHO HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY...
AND TRYING TO GRAB
THEIR ATTENTION...
IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE GREATEST TUMULTUOUSNESS.
AND RIPPED LINING
IS PART OF THAT ROUTINE.
I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO
UNDERSTAND THAT, THOUGH,
BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER DONE IT.
I'D LIKE TO SEE
THEIR DOUBLE-DECKER TOUR.

ELEVEN PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED
OFF THIS BRIDGE...
AND SURVIVED.
ONE OF MY CRUISING
DREAMS WOULD BE...
TO GET A CRUISE TOGETHER
WITH THOSE 11.
I LOVE THESE THINGS.
I CRUISED THIS BRIDGE
ONCE SOLO...
WHEN I WAS IN
A SEVERE SOLO ANGST,
WHEN THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD
DIVORCED ITSELF FROM ME...
ON A SINGULAR EVENING,
WHICH IS USUALLY
ON TUESDAY NIGHTS.
AND, UH,
I CRUISED THE BRIDGE,
REALIZING THAT, UH,
THE PILLARS OF STONE...
WERE MY FRIENDS.
THEY REALLY
MAKE ME FEEL WHOLE.
THEY REMIND ME THAT MY FUTURE
HAS A BRIGHTNESS, PERHAPS.
EVEN IF I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO BELIEVES THAT,
I KNOW THEY BELIEVE IT.
ONE THING I LIKE ABOUT...
HAVING THE TRIPTYCHS OF
THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE AS A FRIEND,
CERTAINLY, IS THAT
IT NEVER CONTRADICTS ME.
IF IT MAKES ME FEEL FUTILE,
IT DOES IT INDIRECTLY,
WITH A SUBTLETY.
IT DOES IT WITH AN AMBIVALENCE
AND AN ALOOFNESS.
THERE'S NO VICTORY
IN ITS SUBJUGATION OF ME.
IF IT SUBJUGATES ME,
THAT'S THE DELUSION,
THE POWER OF MY OWN MIND.
THE BEST MOMENTS IN
OUR FRIENDSHIPS...
ARE WHEN I BECOME THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE IN MY MIND,
WHEN I REALIZE
THAT WE ARE EQUALS.
THESE ARE
THE WORLD TRADE CENTERS.
YEAH, SEE THESE TWO TOWERS?
THE TWIN TOWERS, SEE?
BROTHERS.
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO, UM,
SPIN IN BETWEEN
THE TWO TOWERS.
YOU KNOW, LIKE, UM, SPIN AROUND
AND YOU MAKE YOURSELF DIZZY?
THEN YOU LOOK UP,
AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BUILDINGS
ARE FALLING IN ON TOP OF YOU.
YEAH, I RECOMMEND THAT.
IT'S FUN.
IF YOU GET TO STAND IN THE
PLAZA BETWEEN THE TWO TOWERS.
BUT DON'T LOOK UP
UNTIL AFTER YOU'RE DIZZY.
GOOD VIEW
OF COMMUTERS...
RUNNING TOWARDS
THEIR DESTINATIONS...
AND FROM THEMSELVES.
<i>I THINK THAT WHEN I
THINK ABOUT MY FUTURE,
<i>INTERESTINGLY, I THINK
ABOUT MY GRANDPARENTS,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDPARENTS
ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
I SPENT MANY
FORMATIVE MOMENTS...
IN MY FORMATIVE YEARS
WITH THEM.
ALL OF MY SUMMERS
WERE CRUISING WITH THEM.
AND FROM THEIR
POINT OF VIEW,
I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL
THAT I AM CURRENTLY A FAILURE...
AND WILL ALWAYS BE
A DOWNTRODDEN FAILURE.
AND I THINK THAT OFTEN THAT
MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THE FUTURE...
VEER TOWARDS THEIR POINTS
OF VIEW ON THE UNIVERSE,
WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT,
AND WHAT THEY CONSIDER
TO BE IMPORTANT...
IS A BASIC SELF-PRESERVATIONISM...
AND SECURITY THAT I AM NOT
CREATING FOR MYSELF.
WHAT THEY CONSIDER TO BE
IMPORTANT IS HAVING AN OCCUPATION,
A NICHE IN SOCIETY,
SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE AT A PARTY AND
SOMEBODY ASKS YOU WHAT YOU DO,
YOU'LL HAVE
A SINGLE-WORD ANSWER...
OR AT LEAST YOU CAN ANSWER
WITHIN A SENTENCE.
WELCOME. <i>I KNOW THAT THEY
THINK THAT I'M NOT ALTOGETHER...</i>
<i>WITH MY FEET ON THE GROUND.
<i>I KNOW THAT THEY FEEL THEY'RE
GOING TO BE DYING VERY SOON...
<i>WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I AM
GOING TO KIND OF FADE OUT...
<i>INTO A SUPRATERRESTRIAL
FAILURE.
A SERIES OF AGGRAVATIONS,
A SERIES OF FRUSTRATIONS.
THEIR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ME
FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY LIFE...
IS SOMETHING I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN CONTENDING WITH...
AND ALWAYS BEEN OBSESSED WITH.
BYE-BYE. THANK YOU.
<i>IF I HAD AN IMMEDIATE GOAL
ON AN AFTERNOON LIKE TODAY,
<i>IT WOULD BE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE
SOME CONCRETENESS TO THEM,
<i>TO GIVE THEM
A PLATTER OF SUCCESS,
<i>EVEN IF IT WAS ONE ANECDOTE.
<i>SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD,
IN THEIR OWN WORLD...
<i>AND THEIR OWN VERNACULAR,
TASTE AND SAY,
"YES, HE DOES HAVE SOMETHING.
THERE IS HOPE.
THERE IS SOME SORT
OF SUCCESS IN HIS LIFE".
I GRANT YOU,
ALL THESE WORDS I'M USING
ARE KIND OF BLAND AND VAGUE TERMS,
BUT IN MY GRANDPARENTS' WORLD,
THEY'RE THE MOST CONCRETE AND
ABSORBING GOALS A PERSON CAN HAVE.
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE
ABLE TO TELL MY GRANDPARENTS...
THAT I'VE DONE SOMETHING
THAT THEY CAN APPRECIATE,
THAT THEY CAN RESPECT.
I REALLY, REALLY
DO NOT WANT TO BECOME...
THE PERSON THAT THEY THINK
THAT I'M GOING TO BECOME.
THE, UH, IMAGE MAKES ME THINK
OF THIS CONVERSATION,
UH, WITH THIS WOMAN
THE OTHER DAY.
SHE WAS A FASTIDIOUS, JUDAIC-TYPE
WOMAN IN VERY SEXUAL SLACKS.
WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT THE GRID PLAN.
AND I MADE THE COMMENT
ABOUT HOW, YOU KNOW,
THE GRID PLAN EMANATES
FROM OUR WEAKNESSES,
THIS LAYOUT OF AVENUES
AND STREETS IN NEW YORK CITY,
THIS SYSTEM
OF 90-DEGREE ANGLES.
TO ME, THE GRID PLAN IS PURITAN,
IT'S HOMOGENIZING,
IN A CITY WHERE THERE IS
NO HOMOGENIZATION AVAILABLE.
THERE IS ONLY TOTAL EXISTENCE,
TOTAL CACOPHONY,
A TOTAL FLOWING OF HUMAN
ETHNICITIES AND TRIBES AND BEINGS...
AND GRADATIONS OF AWARENESS
AND CONSCIOUSNESS AND CRUISING.
AND--
THIS WOMAN TURNS TO ME. SHE GOES,
"I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT".
SHE GOES, "I CAN'T IMAGINE IT.
EVERYONE LIKES THE GRID PLAN".
OF COURSE,
THE QUESTION IS,
"WHO IS EVERYONE?"
IT'S JUST WHAT I HAD SAID.
WHOEVER THAT IS
UNDER THE WHITE COMFORTER,
CUDDLED UP WITH 34th STREET
AND BROADWAY,
EXISTING ON THE CONCRETE
OF THIS CITY,
HUNGRY AND DISHEVELLED,
STRUGGLING TO CRAWL
THEIR WAY ONTO THIS ISLAND...
WITH ALL OF THEIR MACHINATED
RAGES AND HELLISHNESS...
AND SELF-ORCHESTRATED
PURGATORIES--
I MEAN, WHAT DOES THAT PERSON
THINK ABOUT THE GRID PLAN?
PROBABLY MUCH MORE ON MY PLANE
OF THINKING, MY GRADATION OF BEING,
WHICH IS, LET'S JUST
BLOW UP THE GRID PLAN...
AND REWRITE THE STREETS TO BE...
MUCH MORE A SELF-PORTRAITURE
OF OUR PERSONAL STRUGGLES,
RATHER THAN SOME REAL ESTATE
BROKER'S WET DREAM FROM 1807.
WE'RE FORCED TO WALK
IN THESE RIGHT ANGLES.
DOESN'T SHE FIND IT
INFURIATING?
BY BEING SO COMPLETELY
ALLEGIANT TO THE GRID PLAN--
I THINK MOST NOTEWORTHY
IS THIS IDIOM:
"I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
CHANGING THE GRID PLAN".
SHE'S REALLY, UH,
ALIGNING HERSELF...
WITH THIS CIVILIZATION.
IT'S LIKE SAYING, "I CAN'T IMAGINE
ALTERING THIS CIVILIZATION.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE ALTERING
THIS MEEK AND LYING MORALITY...
"THAT RULES OUR LIVES.
"CAN'T IMAGINE STANDING UP ON A
CHAIR IN THE ROOM...
"TO CHANGE PERSPECTIVE.
"I CAN'T IMAGINE CHANGING
MY MIND ON ANYTHING.
"I, IN THE END, CAN'T IMAGINE
HAVING MY OWN IDENTITY...
THAT CONTRADICTS
OTHER IDENTITIES".
WHEN SHE SAYS TO ME,
AFTER MY STATEMENTS,
"EVERYONE LIKES
THE GRID PLAN,"
ISN'T SHE AUTOMATICALLY
EXCLUDING MYSELF FROM "EVERYONE"?
HOW COULD YOU NOT LIKE
THE GRID PLAN?
IT'S SO FUNCTIONAL.
YOU TAKE A RIGHT TURN,
A RIGHT TURN, A RIGHT TURN.
THERE'S A RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT,
YELLOW LIGHT. IT'S SO SYMMETRICAL.
BY SAYING THAT EVERYONE
LIKES THE GRID PLAN,
YOU'RE SAYING, "I'M GOING TO RELIVE
ALL THE MISTAKES MY PARENTS MADE.
"I'M GOING TO IDENTIFY
AND RELIVE ALL THE SORROWS...
"MY MOTHER EVER
LIVED THROUGH.
"I WILL PROPAGATE AND CREATE
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHILDREN...
"IN THE SAME DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY
THAT I WAS RAISED.
"I WILL SPREAD NEUROSIS
THROUGHOUT THE LANDSCAPE...
"AND DO MY BEST...
"TO RECREATE MYSELF
AND THE DAMAGES OF MY LIFE...
FOR THE NEXT GENERATION".
IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL MAPS
OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING
OF THIS CENTURY,
MADISON AVENUE,
IN FRONT OF YOU, IN BACK OF YOU,
IS NOT EVEN ON THE MAP.
THIS BEGINS AS A SERVICE ROAD
FOR FIFTH AVENUE,
ONE BLOCK TO THE WEST.
FIFTH AVENUE IS
"MILLIONAIRE'S ROW,"
A SYSTEM OF
ARISTOCRATIC MANSIONS.
THIS IS WHERE
THE HORSE STABLES ARE.
THIS IS WHERE THE GARDENERS'
SHACKS ARE, NOT THAT LONG AGO.
MADISON AVENUE,
NOT EVEN A BOULEVARD...
UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE
TAKES OVER THE ISLAND.
WILL YOU LOOK AT IT TODAY.
MAY I RESTATE, RECAPITULATE...
AND GENERALLY REGURGITATE,
WHEN YOU ARE SITTING IN THE
MIDDLE OF MIDTOWN MANHATTAN,
YOU ARE SITTING AMONGST
A 20th-CENTURY INVENTION,
A CITY THAT GREW UP
AT AN EXPLOSION, AS AN EXPLOSION.
IT IS AN EXPLOSION,
AN EXPERIMENT,
A SYSTEM OF TEST TUBES GURGLING,
BOILING OUT OF CONTROL,
A RADIOACTIVE ATOM
SWIRLING.
CIVILIZATION HAS NEVER
LOOKED LIKE THIS BEFORE.
THIS IS LUDICROUSNESS,
AND THIS CANNOT LAST.
THE NEW ANN TAYLOR STORE
ON THE RIGHT.
YESTERDAY GRAY LINE
FINALLY ENFORCED THEIR, UH,
UM, OBLIGATORY
UNIFORM POLICY.
IT'S A NEW POLICY.
WE HAVE TO--
ALL THE TOUR GUIDES HAVE TO WEAR...
GRAY LINE
BRIGHT RED SHIRTS.
AND CERTAINLY MY ILLNESS,
I THINK, IS ASSOCIATED...
WITH THIS LATEST
LEGISLATION.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW THAT I CAME...
TO THE DOUBLE-DECKER BUS
FOR EMPLOYMENT...
FOR ONE REASON
AND ONE ESSENTIAL REASON ONLY,
AND THAT WAS TO, UH,
MEET WOMEN,
TO MEET AND SEDUCE WOMEN...
FROM EVERY HABITABLE
CONTINENT IN THE WORLD.
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE.
I'M CERTAINLY NOT
HERE FOR THE MONEY.
AND, UM, THEY'RE JUST
LITERALLY BLOWING MY SHTICK.
I SAID TO GEORGE YESTERDAY,
BECAUSE
THE DISPATCHERS BASICALLY SAID,
"IF YOU DON'T PUT ON THAT SHIRT,
WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU HOME EARLY".
IT CAN LEAD
TO MY TERMINATION.
THAT'S HOW SERIOUS
THEY ARE ABOUT THIS.
I SAID, "AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED,
"THE OFFICIAL GRAY LINE POLICY
AT THIS POINT IS, YOU KNOW,
"'SPEED, YOU ARE NOT GONNA
GET LAID ON OUR BUSES.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE'."
THEY'RE GONNA
MAKE ME PULL A SHTICK...
THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS PULLIN',
AND IT'S TERRIBLE.
AND, UH, REALLY,
MOSTLY IT'S JUST THE REGIME
SENDING OUT A MESSAGE...
THAT I'M ENTIRELY REPLACEABLE.
IT'S THEM SAYING,
"WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR TOUR.
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU.
"YOU WEAR THIS SHIRT, AND IF
YOU DON'T CONFORM, YOU'RE OUT,
'CAUSE WE CAN REPLACE YOU".
UNEMPLOYMENT IN THIS CITY
RIGHT NOW IS SEVEN PERCENT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IN FRONT OF US.
"ANTI,"
AS OPPOSED TO "CRUISE".
THIS IS AN ELEMENTARY AND VERY
PHYSICAL EXAMPLE OF ANTI-CRUISE,
WHERE OUR IMMOBILITY...
IS CREATED BY LITERALLY
JUST A BLOCKADE OF THE SIDEWALK.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS EVERYWHERE.
EVERY GOOD DAY OF MY LIFE
IS A DAY I EVADE THE ANTI-CRUISE.
PLEASE KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN,
'CAUSE I DO SENSE A LOT OF THAT
NEGATIVE FODDER IN THE AIR.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT THIS IS A VERY
ECLECTIC AND DANGEROUS AFTERNOON.
THE ANTI-CRUISE
IS CERTAINLY MOBILIZED TODAY.
ON OUR LEFT WILL BE
THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE,
CAPITAL OF INCARCERATION.
INCARCERATION, ANOTHER BASIC
ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES,
UTILIZED
IN AN UNORIGINAL WAY...
IN THE CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE
ON OUR LEFT.
AND I CAN PERSONALLY
VOUCH FOR THAT.
THE ANTI-CRUISE IS AN ATTEMPT
TO IMPRISON US.
AT EVERY LEVEL OF LIVING,
IT EXISTS.
YOUNGER CRUISERS
HAVE ASKED ME, "WHY?
"WHY IS THE ANTI-CRUISE
SO AVARICIOUS AND CONSTANT...
IN ITS ATTEMPT
TO STOP THE CRUISE?"
AND I HAVE NO ANSWER.
THERE IS NO ANSWER.
I MEAN,
IT'S GRAVITATIONAL.
IT'S A RELATIONSHIP THAT'S
MADE UP OF RECIPROCALS...
AND OF PULLING GRAVITIES.
IT SIMPLY EXISTS.
WHERE THERE IS CRUISE,
THERE IS AN ESCORT OF ANTI-CRUISE.
BUT EVEN IN A COMPLETE BASTION...
OF ANTI-CRUISE FODDER,
WHICH THIS ENTIRE
SQUARE BLOCK IS,
THERE IS CRUISE.
SOMEWHERE IN THERE IS
A SPARKLE OF CRUISING ENERGY...
DEEPLY SUBLIMATED WITHIN THE
BELLOWING BELLY OF THE BEAST.
SURVIVOR.
HE KNOWS NO PRISON.
THEY WERE ALL OVER
THE PRISON FLOOR,
BUT YOU NEVER SAW THEM
LOOKING MELANCHOLY.
THEY KEPT CRUISIN'.
NO IMPRISONMENT
FOR THE COCKROACH.
LIFE-IMPENDING
DRASTIC SURVIVOR.
THROUGH THE MILLENNIAS,
THROUGH THE ERUPTIONS OF TIME,
PAST THE DINOSAURS,
WITNESSING THE FLIGHT
OF BIRDS FOR THE FIRST TIME,
CLOUDS DYING,
ASTEROIDS HITTING THE EARTH.
NO PRISON FOR THE COCKROACH.
I HAVE SUCH RESPECT
FOR THOSE BASTARDS.
BUT I WAS NOT SO FORTUNATE.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS
CRUISING HARD AT THAT TIME,
SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT--
THE ANTI-CRUISE REALLY
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK...
COULD NOT ALLOW ME
EVEN PHYSICAL MOBILITY.
I WAS-- ACCORDING TO THEM,
I WAS RUNNING FROM
THE COPS FOR A MONTH...
BEFORE THEY CAUGHT UP TO ME.
I WAS NOT EVEN AWARE
THAT I WAS RUNNING FROM THE COPS...
AS MUCH AS FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE.
I FELT LIKE A FUGITIVE,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
EVERY DAY I FEEL
LIKE A FUGITIVE.
IT NEVER OCCURRED TO THEM...
THAT I'M RUNNING
FROM THE ANTI-CRUISE EVERY DAY.
WHEN I WAS UP IN FRONT OF THE
JUDGE FOR MY ARRAIGNMENT,
THE JUDGE SAID,
"MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH
THIS CASE IS THAT THIS GUY--
"THIS CURRENT PERSON
WE'RE JUDGING--
RAN FROM THE POLICE
FOR A MONTH".
IF I COULD HAVE SPOKEN-- OF COURSE,
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO SPEAK--
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"IT'S BEEN A LOT MORE THAN A MONTH.
"I'VE BEEN RUNNING
FROM YOU PEOPLE ALL MY LIFE.
ALL MY LIFE.
AND I'M GONNA KEEP RUNNING".
THERE ARE SO MANY PRISONERS,
INMATES, SO MANY
PEOPLE TO BE JUDGED,
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO
CONSIDER YOU AS A HUMAN BEING.
YOU'RE FILED THROUGH
AS IN AN ASSEMBLY LINE.
IN SOME WAYS,
IT MADE ME THINK OF THE FACT THAT
IN TERMS OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY,
WE HAVE THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE
AS PLANTS.
SO THIS ENTIRE
NOTION OF INDIVIDUALITY...
IS A DELUSION ANYWAY.
IT IS A DIREFUL DELUSION.
THERE IS NO REAL INDIVIDUALITY
EXCEPT FOR THAT WHICH WE PROJECT.
BUT SITTING IN THE CELL BLOCK,
I REALIZED THAT THE PURSUIT OF
THAT SO-CALLED INDIVIDUALITY...
IS EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN.
THE FULLEST PURSUIT OF THOSE...
POSSIBILITIES OF THAT
"INDIVIDUALITY,"
EVEN IF IT IS
AN ABSOLUTE FAILURE,
IT IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
FAILURE I CAN THINK OF.
<i>I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A DELUSION.
<i>I DON'T CARE IF WE HAVE
THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE AS PLANTS.
<i>I WANT TO BE THE PLANT
THAT GROWS THE HIGHEST.
<i>I WANT TO BE THE BEAN STALK.
<i>I WANT TO BE THE FLOWER...
<i>THAT SMELLS MOST PROFUSELY,
<i>THAT VEERS MOST DRASTICALLY
TOWARDS THE SUNLIGHT.
LOOK AT THESE BEAUTIFUL
LEAVES, FOR GOD'S SAKES.
YOU SEE THAT?
SEE HOW STUBBORN THIS LEAF IS?
I'M TRYING TO PICK IT UP, LIKE LOOK,
PICK UP THE SPIRIT.
LIKE PICK IT UP NOW.
LET'S GET SOME EXPANSION.
LET'S GET SOME ERECTION GOIN'.
HE'S LIKE, "I'M FLACCID. I'M NOT
MOVIN'. I'M NOT DOIN' IT TODAY".
COME ON, IT'S WEST 67th STREET.
IT'S SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
IT'S AUGUST. DO THIS.
"NO, NO, NO".
COME ON, GET IT UP.
"NO, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TODAY".
COME ON NOW!
LOOK AT THIS GUY.
HE'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
DIFFERENT COLOR,
DIFFERENT ATTITUDE.
LOOK AT THAT STYLE.
AND THEY MOVE WITH YOU.
THEY'VE GOT SUCH MOBILITY THERE.
THIS GUY'S LIKE STREAMLINED,
LIKE SEXY.
SO SEXY.
LOOK AT THOSE LINES.
AN AIRPLANE.
BEAUTIFUL.
<i>GOTTA RISE.
RISE.
RISE TO THE OCCASION.
THESE PEOPLE ARE
ON THE 12:00 DOWN,
AND THEY DON'T LOOK LIKE IT TO ME.
THE 12:00 DOWN ON THIS PARTICULAR
DAY WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE
UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT NOW.
LOOK AT THIS.
RISE.
GO FOR IT.
GOOD LUCK OUT THERE.
GOOD-BYE.
GOOD LUCK.
<i>I THINK THAT MY FAVORITE VICTORY
IS THE ABILITY TO FEEL.
<i>SUCH INSINCERITY--
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
<i>IF THE CRUISE IS ANYTHING,
BE IT APPRECIATION, BE IT A VOYAGE,
<i>BE IT AN ADVENTURE
THAT LEADS BACK TO OURSELVES,
<i>BE IT A CARTWHEEL
OR A SOMERSAULT--
<i>IF YOU FIND THE CRUISE IN A PIECE
OF CARROT CAKE, A TOPLESS BAR,
<i>THE ONE THING THE CRUISE
ALWAYS IS, I THINK, IS SINCERE.
<i>AND SINCERITY IS ONE OF MY
FAVORITE VICTORIES IN THIS LIFETIME.
I MEAN, HOW MUCH REBELLION
DID I HAVE TO EXPERIENCE?
HOW MUCH FIGHTING DID I DO?
HOW MANY TIMES DID
I HAVE TO IGNORE...
MY FATHER'S INABILITY TO EMOTE?
HOW WE ALL IGNORE OUR FATHERS'
INABILITY TO EMOTE IN OUR PRESENCE.
HOW MUCH AIR-CONDITIONING
DID I HAVE TO TRANSCEND...
AND THE COMFORT
THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT?
THE COMFORTABLE COUCHES,
THE TELEVISION,
THE MAGNITUDE OF STATIC
THAT SURROUNDS US.
HOW MUCH DAILY INFIGHTING,
STRATEGIZING, EVADING, RUNNING...
DID I HAVE TO DO
FOR THE ABILITY TO FEEL,
FOR THE ABILITY TO EMOTE,
FOR THE SIMPLE MOMENTS
WHEN I FEEL ACTUAL PASSION?
HELLO, EVERYONE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME IN THE BACK?
WELCOME TO NEW YORK CITY.
H.G. WELLS ONCE WROTE
THAT TO TELL
THE SOCIAL HISTORY
OF NEW YORK CITY...
IS TO TELL THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD, THE STORY OF THE WORLD.
IT'S GOING TO BE
A LONG MORNING.
<i>TO ALL MY ENEMIES
WHO ADD FLAVOR TO MY LIFE,
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE
AND TALK TO ME ABOUT IT?
TO LESLIE LINDENSTRAUS:
LOOK, IF YOU WANNA TRY TO CHOKE
ME WHEN I'M, LIKE, PREPUBESCENT...
AND REALLY MUCH SMALLER
THAN YOU, THAT'S FINE.
I KNOW THAT'S HOW WE ALL
REALLY FEEL ABOUT EACH OTHER,
AND I KNOW THAT'S WHAT
IT'S REALLY ALL ABOUT.
BUT I'M GONNA FIND YOU AND KICK
YOUR ASS 'CAUSE I'M NOT SEVEN...
AND PREPUBESCENT ANYMORE.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE,
BUT I REMEMBER THAT DAY.
TO JORDAN:
LOOK, BANANAS MAY BE SOMETHING...
THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND
CAN EAT WITHOUT ME, ALL RIGHT?
YES, I WANTED A BANANA
AND YES, YOU LEFT ME OUT.
BUT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE
THERE ARE OTHER BANANAS.
I THINK I PROVED THAT
TO YOU BY NOW.
<i>TO TIRZAH:</i>
THERE WAS ABOUT TWO HOURS OF
MY ENTIRE LIFE THUS FAR ON EARTH...
WHEN I WAS ABSOLUTELY
DEPENDENT UPON YOU.
AND THOSE WERE A COUPLE
OF THE WORST HOURS OF MY LIFE.
TO CHARLES PURPURRA: I KNOW
YOU NEVER READ MY SCREENPLAY.
AND TO LESLIE LEE: I KNOW YOU
DIDN'T READ THAT FULL-LENGTH PLAY.
I WORKED ON IT. I SWEATED
ON IT. I TURMOILED OVER IT.
I MALAISED THROUGH IT.
I LIVED ABOVE IT, UNDER IT,
BECAUSE OF IT, NOT BECAUSE OF IT.
I HATED IT. I LOVED IT.
I DIED AND I WAS REBORN WITHIN THE
ROOM AS I WORKED ON THAT PLAY,
AND I KNOW
YOU DID NOT READ IT.
TO SWAYNE,
WHO SUPPOSEDLY WAS GOING
TO READ THAT SCRIPT I GAVE HIM.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
FUCK THE SCRIPT.
YOU ARE FOREVER KNOWN
AS THE TOUR GUIDE...
WHO GOT HIT BY A TRAFFIC LIGHT.
AND I THINK THAT'S
THE PROPER EPITHET FOR YOU.
AND HOW DARE YOU
DO A TINA HOWE PLAY...
IN THE MIDDLE OF JUNE
IN NEW YORK CITY,
AS IF I HAVE TIME TO SIT THERE
AND LISTEN TO THAT TRASH...
WHEN THERE IS SHTICKING
AND CRUISING TO BE DONE.
YOU OBVIOUSLY LEAD
AN "INFINTESTIMIAL" EXISTENCE.
TO JOSH:
YOUR NARCISSISM...
IS MEDIOCRE.
NARCISSISM IN SOME WAYS
IS INEVITABLE.
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE ALL LIVING IN
THE SAME BODIES FOR THIS MORTALITY,
IT'S ALMOST INEVITABLE
THAT WE WILL BE...
SELF-ABSORBED AT SOME POINT.
BUT WHY IS IT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE
HAVE A NARCISSISM AS YOURSELF...
THAT LEADS TO MEDIOCRITY
AND NOTHING ELSE?
<i>TO JEN AND MICHELLE:</i>
THAT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE AN ORGY.
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT
CAME DOWN TO A DOUBLE DATE...
WITH ME AS A FIFTH WHEEL.
THAT SUCKS. I'VE NEVER BEEN
IN A SITUATION WHERE I'VE BEEN...
SO SEVERELY DISSED.
I MEAN, AN ORGY IS WHEN
EVERYBODY PARTICIPATES,
NOT FOUR OUT OF FIVE IN THE ROOM.
TO RAELLE:
I AM NOT GOING TO GO
TO SOME SINGLE JEWISH PARTY...
BECAUSE I'M A DISHEVELLED
WRECK OF A SHTICKER...
TO TRY TO MEET
SOME LONG ISLAND JEWESS...
AND LAND ON A FRONT YARD
IN A HOUSE WITH TWO CARS...
AND CHILDREN WHO
BAWL MY NAME...
THROUGH THEIR OWN
SALIVARY GLANDS.
THAT MAY BE YOUR APPROXIMATE
GOAL, BUT THAT IS NOT MINE.
I AM SURPRISED
BY YOUR UNORIGINALITY,
AND I AM TIRED
OF YOUR SILLY EMASCULATIONS.
I WOULD PREFER TO BE
EMASCULATED BY A WOMAN...
WITH MUCH MORE SEVERITY...
AND WITH A LITTLE BIT
MORE BACKBONE.
TO MEM LEVITCH:
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE ME ALONE?
I'M TRYING TO LEAD SOMETHING
OF A YOUTHFUL EXISTENCE HERE.
I'M STANDING HERE
ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE TODAY...
TALKING TO THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE...
ABOUT THE MINUSCULE
MOMENTS OF ALIENATION...
THAT I REMEMBER SO WELL
OVER THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY,
AND ALL YOU CAN DO
IS LEAVE MESSAGES ON MY MACHINE...
AND LECTURE ME ABOUT
HOW MUCH YOU NEED ME...
UP THERE IN WESTCHESTER.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
CHECK THE AIR IN YOUR TIRES?
YOU NEVER ONCE VAULTED
OUT OF THE GOLDEN CHAIR.
YOU NEVER HAD THE GUTS,
THE AUDACITY,
TO STAND UP AND DO
SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE.
YOU COULD ONLY UTILIZE
YOUR OWN NARCISSISMS...
AND YOUR OWN SELF-ABSORPTION...
TO ALWAYS, IN A TONAL SENSE,
IMPLY TO ME, YOUR CHILD,
THAT I HAD TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.
AND THIS HAS BEEN A DAILY CRUSADE
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF MY BIRTH.
AND WHEN I EMANATED
FROM YOUR BLOODY THIGHS,
IF I'D KNOWN ALL THIS, I'M SURE
I WOULD HAVE CRAWLED BACK IN.
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT
ALL THE MENSTRUATION...
THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT...
WAS PARTS OF MYSELF LEFT BEHIND
THAT YOU WERE CHOKING TO DEATH?
THAT WAS MY BLOOD!

THE CIRCLE.
WHEN YOU CROSS THE STREET
CALLED HOUSTON STREET,
YOU ENTER THE DISTRICT
CALLED SOHO,
WHICH STANDS
FOR "SOUTH OF HOUSTON".
AND AS WE
ENTER SOHO TODAY,
I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT...
TO DEDICATE THIS CRUISE
AND THIS ENTRANCE INTO SOHO...
TO OUR DRIVER AND NAVIGATOR
DOWNSTAIRS, BENITEZ.
IN A CERTAIN PERSONAL
DESPAIR TODAY,
I WANT HIM TO KNOW
THAT I AM WITH HIM,
AND I'M BACKING HIM UP ALL THE WAY.
WE'VE DONE

BENITEZ,
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

I WROTE JON A LETTER ABOUT
THE, UH, LAMED VOVNIKS.
UM--
THE, UH-- FROM
THE ANCIENT CABALA.
THIRTY-SIX, UH, IN HEBREW--
LAMED VOVNIK.
I BELIEVE IT MEANS 36.
AND, ESSENTIALLY,
IT DISCUSSES HOW THERE ARE 36
HUMAN BEINGS ON THE PLANET...
AT ALL TIMES-- ONLY 36--
WHO, UH, UPHOLD AND
CREATE THE EQUILIBRIUM...
FOR ALL OF OUR SUFFERINGS.
THEY TAKE THE MALAISE AND
THE MAELSTROM OF PERSECUTIONS...
AND THE DISASTERS OF THE WORLD
ONTO THEIR OWN SHOULDERS,
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE,
THROUGHOUT THEIR
FLESH-PHYSICAL-INCARNATED LIVES.
AND WITHOUT THESE 36 PEOPLE,
THE INFRASTRUCTURE
OF THE WORLD WOULD FALL APART...
AND THERE WOULD BE ARMAGEDDON
AND PERHAPS THE FINAL JUDGMENT,
BUT NOT A PRETTY JUDGMENT,
BY ANY MEANS.
FINAL BUT NOT PRETTY.
MOST OF THE VOVNIKS
DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY'RE VOVNIKS.
THEY SUFFER
IN AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE HELL,
AND THEY SWIM IN AN ENTIRE
WHIRLPOOL OF HUMILITY...
WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEMSELVES OR WHO THEY ARE...
OR THEIR IMPORTANCE
IN THE WORLD.
AND THE VOVNIK MORDECAI,
WHO LEFT THE LARGE FAMILY
OF THE LEVIS...
TO MOVE TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA,
UH, IN THE 17th CENTURY,
WHERE THE BAAL SHEM TOV
HAD SET UP CRUISING HEADQUARTERS...
AND INSTITUTED THE BEGINNINGS OF
THE HASIDIM, HASIDIC RELIGION.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THE ENLIGHTENED RABBI,
PREACHING THE CARNIVOROUSNESS
AND THE RELIGIOSITY IN JOY...
AND THE ECSTASY OF PRAYER.
I MEAN, THE HASIDS ARE NO LONGER
GOING TO SIT WITH PRAYER BOOKS,
YOU KNOW, SILENTLY PRAYING
IN DARKENED SYNAGOGUES.
THEY ARE GOING
TO JUMP AROUND THE ROOM.
THEY ARE GOING TO SCREAM
AND YELL THEIR LOVE FOR GOD.
THEY'RE GOING TO DO CARTWHEELS.
AND MORDECAI WENT THERE
TO HELP CLEAN OUT OUTHOUSES.
BASICALLY, HE WAS A PEASANT
LIVING IN THE TOWN.
DERELICTS AND BUMS AND GENIUSES
AND ARISTOCRATS AND POETS...
AND MEN OF EVERY KIND
OF OCCUPATION AND PHYLUM...
WERE GOING TO MIERDZBERGZST
ON THE ROCKY GLACIERS OF SILESIA...
JUST TO HAVE THEIR OWN MOMENTS
WITH THE BAAL SHEM TOV,
THIS ENLIGHTENED RABBI.
AND MORDECAI REVERENTLY
STOOD IN THE SAME ROOM...
WITH THE BAAL
SHEM TOV A FEW TIMES...
AS HE WENT OFF
TO DO HIS DAILY TOIL.
EVENTUALLY, THEY CALLED HIM
"THE DANCER OF GOD,"
BECAUSE WHEN THE HASIDS WOULD
FORM FOR THEIR REELS OF DANCE...
IN HONOR TO THEIR ECSTASY
TO THEIR GOD,
MORDECAI WOULD JUMP SO HIGH...
AND WOULD DANCE
WITH SUCH AN EXUBERANCE,
THE OTHER HASIDICS WERE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT HIM...
AND FOR HIM,
AND HE WAS EXILED
FROM THE DANCE.
AND SO HE APPEASED HIMSELF
BY DANCING ALONE AT NIGHT...
IN THE SHED RESERVED
FOR THE SICK AND DYING,
AND HE WOULD ENTERTAIN THEM
IN THE EVENINGS ALONE.
SUDDENLY,
THE GAON OF KIEV WHISPERS TO
THE BAAL SHEM TOV ONE DAY...
THAT THERE IS A VOVNIK,
UH, A HOLY, UH, MAN.
THEY HAVE
ANOTHER TERM FOR IT.
A MAN OF TOTAL EQUILIBRIUM,
A LAMED VOVNIK, IN TOWN.
AND SO THEY START SEARCHING
FOR WHO THIS MIGHT BE.
THEY INTERVIEW THE DERELICTS.
THEY INTERVIEW ALL THE PEASANTS.
THEY INTERVIEW THE HANDYMEN.
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THE GUYS WHO
HANG OUT WITH FARM ANIMALS,
ANYBODY WHO MIGHT
BE MENTALLY RETARDED,
AS MANY VOVNIKS
ARE MENTALLY RETARDED.
SUDDENLY, THEY REALIZE THAT THE
GUY WHO CLEANS THE OUTHOUSES...
DISAPPEARS THE NEXT MORNING.
SUDDENLY,
RUMORS SPREAD AROUND.
THEY SAY TO THE BAAL SHEM TOV, "HE
DANCED FOR THE SICK AT NIGHT ALONE.
HE CLEANED THE OUTHOUSES
CONSCIENTIOUSLY".
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV WOOED
THEM AWAY, PUSHED THEM AWAY,
AND WAS CRYING.
AND THERE WAS SILENCE.
AND THE BAAL SHEM TOV
SAID SIMPLY,
"THAT ONE WAS HEALTHY
AMONGST THE SICK,
AND I DID NOT SEE HIM".
<i>- IS THAT OPEN?</i>
- YEAH. THANKS, LARRY.
- HOW YA BEEN?
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
- HANGIN' IN THERE.
- I KNOW THAT FEELIN'.
TODAY'S
MY LAST DAY, MAN. -REALLY?
YEAH. I GOT THE JOB
WORKING WITH TRANSIT.
ALL RIGHT. CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.
I START THAT TUESDAY. -ALL RIGHT.
I WAS GONNA
COME IN MONDAY,
BUT AFTER I HEARD
THE WEATHER REPORT, I SAID NO.
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'VE PAID MY DUES.
WELL, YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF CIRCLES.
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
I'M GLAD TO KNOW THAT
THERE'S A FINISH LINE TO THIS.
I FIND THAT--
I FIND THAT INTERESTING.
THAT'S A GOOD WAY OF LOOKING AT IT,
MAN. -IT'S BEEN SO NICE TO KNOW YOU.
- IT'S BEEN MY PLEASURE.
- YEAH, IT'S BEEN A DAMN PLEASURE.
- YEAH, BUT I'LL BE AROUND.
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH.
PICK UP SOME EXTRA MONEY
FROM TIME TO TIME.
YEAH, I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE
TOO MUCH MONEY. -THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
AND KEEP IT ALIVE.
244 EAST 49th STREET...
WILL BE A QUIET,
BROWN ROW HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NEXT BLOCK ON YOUR LEFT,
STILL CURRENTLY
THE NEW YORK CITY RESIDENCE...
OF KATHARINE HEPBURN.
GRETA GARBO AND BETTE DAVIS,
WHEN THEY WERE BOTH LIVING,
ALSO HAD RESIDENCES
ON THIS NEXT BLOCK.
WHEN THEY ASKED GRETA GARBO WHY
SHE CHOSE TO LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY,
SHE SAID THAT NEW YORK
WAS THE ONLY PLACE...
WHERE SHE COULD BE... ALONE.
<i>I AM CRUISING CURRENTLY...
<i>RIGHT NOW.
<i>I AM CRUISING BECAUSE
I HAVE DEDICATED MYSELF...
<i>TO ALL THAT IS CREATIVE AND
DESTRUCTIVE IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW.
<i>AND I'M EQUALLY IN LOVE
WITH EVERY ASPECT OF MY LIFE...
<i>AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME TURMOIL...
<i>AND ALL THE INGREDIENTS
THAT HAVE CAUSED ME GLORY.
<i>I AM THE LIVING WHISPERED WARNING
IN THE ROMAN GENERAL'S EAR,
<i>"GLORY IS FLEETING".
<i>AND IN THAT VERB,
THAT ACTIVE VERB, "FLEETING,"
<i>THERE I LIVE,
THERE I RESIDE IN THIS MOMENT.
<i>I'VE DEDICATED MYSELF
TO THE IDIOM, "I DON'T KNOW".
<i>AND I'M IN LOVE WITH THE FRANTIC
CHAOS OF THIS LIMITLESS UNIVERSE.
I'VE FACED THIS BEFORE.
THE SECOND TO LAST TIME
I TRIED IT, IT DIDN'T GO OFF,
AND I FOUND MYSELF
OVERLOOKING 42nd STREET.
I WAS, LIKE,
EXACTLY 45 FLOORS UP,
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
FROM THE CHRYSLER BUILDING.
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE.
THE LAST TIME I TRIED IT,
I STOOD ATOP
THE MARRIOTT MARQUIS HOTEL,
THINKING THAT I HAD
SO GLORIOUSLY ONCE AGAIN EVADED...
THE ANTI-CRUISE
FIRE EXIT SIGNALS...
AND THEN WAS
SUDDENLY SURROUNDED...
BY TWO FIRE DEPARTMENTS PEOPLE,
HEAD OF SECURITY.
LECTURE, REPRIMAND.
I BARELY GOT OUT
OF THERE ALIVE.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A KEY BEFORE, THOUGH.
SEEMS TO ME
IT'S THE POTENTIAL OF TURNING IT OFF,
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IS ON AND WHAT IS OFF.
