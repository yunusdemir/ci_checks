==== Tin Man ====
--- Episode 2 ---
Mother?
I missed you.
I don't even know you.
Your light is strong.
Let it guide you through your memories.
I'm a waitress, and a part-time student.
I don't think i can do this.
I'm scared.
When you were a girl,
i used to rock you at our special place.
Remember.
Dg, breakfast!
Wind last night made a real mess a things.
Branches took out a transformer.
Well, you better fix it before it fixes us.
Come on, woman, i can't work on an empty tank.
Besides, i need our expert on this one,
if she ever wakes up.
Morning, sleepyhead.
All right...
Was i asleep?
Dead to the world for 14 hours.
Figured you must've had
something on your mind.
Lord knows i have.
I was wrong, dg.
You have a right to your own life.
I had no business
looking through your stuff last night.
That was last night?
Had that crazy nightmare again, huh?
In technicolor.
Well, you're awake now
so you better help your dad
before he wrecks this place.
But, the farm was wrecked.
Mercy me.
Have you been having
those chili cheese fries before bed again?
But your stories must have
worked their way into my subconscious,
because there was
a frozen lake and a palace,
and my mother was a queen,
and she was trying to get me
to remember this thing about an emerald,
so i could stop my evil sister.
Well, did you?
Remember, i mean?
No, and when i didn't,
she sicked these monkey-bats on me.
Well, you got the storm part right, baby girl.
We got a heck of mess to clean up.
That's the cold hard reality.
Finally talking some sense.
Heck with that.
You know i'd pick a good story
over work any day.
I'd rather hear the big secret about
that emerald the queen whispered into your ear.
Aw, popsicle, i can't remember.
It was something...
What something, honey?
I never said
she whispered anything into my ear.
Sorry, baby girl, guess i blew it.
It's okay, popsicle.
I know you tried your best.
That was all fake?
You are twisted.
Why?
Because with a little re-wiring,
i've gotten something
i've missed out on for too long?
A father's love, a mother's affection.
Where are my real parents.
Our parents?
Well, daddy, the thief,
abandoned us after you...
Died.
Mother never forgave him for that.
Had his name officially banished
from the lands.
Ever the drama queen.
Where is she?
There came a time when she had to be...
Isolated.
Mother?
Dg, where are you?
Let her go.
That can be arranged,
but first you have to do something for me.
Fear not, my child,
there is one thing that can stop her.
The emerald of the eclipse.
The secret to finding it
now lives inside of you.
When the time is right, you will return.
Dg, just...
Tell me where the emerald is.
Just tell me what she whispered to you,
and i will take you to her.
I promise.
I don't remember.
That was a long time ago.
We can pry those memories out of her.
Zero, she's my sister.
I guess i haven't really
made this much of a family reunion, have i?
Well, i wasn't expecting a picnic.
I want to show you something,
share something with you.
"the majestic queen of the O.Z.
had two lovely daughters, she."
"double eclipse it is foreseen,
light meets dark in the stillness between,"
"but only one and one alone,
shall hold the emerald and take the throne."
So, what is that?
The great and ominous prophecy
of the O.Z.
It's a nursery rhyme.
A few couplets that roll
pleasingly off the tongue.
It's not who we are, dg.
You tried to kill me.
I was just a child
you know, i...
I foolishly believed the part about
"only one and one alone."
and you don't now?
No.
I believe that the prophecy
can be what you and i make of it.
Dg, we were such good friends.
We spent hours imaging what the O.Z.
Would be like when we grew up.
Please, you must remember that.
We were friends?
We'd explore the woods, gather apples,
skip little stones across the lake.
We made mother crazy with worry.
Apples?
No.
I'm not buying what you're doing
with this whole "keys to the kingdom" crap.
I'm not doing anything.
I just want
what the prophecy can bring to both of us.
It's our birthright.
It's our chance to make a new O.Z.
Just tell me where it is.
I don't rember.
Dg...
My lovely little sister.
That was the wrong...
Answer.
Now we do it your way.
I'll take her for a reading with lylo.
If you rember nothing else, remember this.
The next time i snuff out
your insignificant little life,
there'll be no one standing by to save you.
Raw?
Cain...
Now it's dinner for three.
Lylo...
No!
He's not one of us anymore.
No iron suit for you this time.
No wife and child
crying for years to free you from it.
My family's alive?
My family's alive?
My family's alive?
You been sleeping for hours like a...
Like a baby with his pacifier.
I thought you were dead.
Ditto.
You know, i may have saved you
from hypothermia, but...
This is what saved your life.
It stopped the bullet.
Dg...
Azkadellia.
Raw?
I don't know, i can't find him.
Either they took him, too, or...
- He's dead, or--
- maybe he ran away.
You know, you really should do something
about that bitter cynicism of yours, cain.
Why?
Someone's got to keep
your wide-eyed optimism in check.
Hey, glitch...
What?
I owe you one.
You know, cain, professional psychiatric therapy
is only a crow's call away these days.
I think a man like you
with your issues of masculinity, and the...
Well, we call it
the "boy scout syndrome..."
no...
Leave him alone!
No...
No!
No...
No!
Stop!
Stop!
A whisper, lylo.
All i'm looking for
is a secret whispered to a little girl!
Lylo can't find.
- Focus!
- Something protecting her memories!
Break through.
Now!
Lylo is trying!
Don't try!
Do!
How can he rember, if i can't?
What did mother whisper into dg's ear
about the emerald?
Emerald...
Only thing can stop Azkadellia.
Focus, lylo!
Where is it?
All is gray!
Emerald within the gray gale.
Gray gale?
What is the gray gale?
Don't know.
Can't see.
Where is it?
Hurts to reach into her memories.
Memories surrounded by...
Magic.
Lylo!
Magic?
I don't have to guess
who's responsible for that, do i?
Mother...
More secrets?
You've cloaked dg's memories
with your magic.
You're the one
who forced secrets into our lives.
Well, you did your work a little too well.
All traces of the gray gale are gone.
She'll never remember now.
Are you surprised
i know about the gray gale?
What do you know?
Learn to love me, mother.
Learn to trust me,
and i will give you back your throne.
Put the crown upon your head,
and kneel at your feet.
The loyal daughter you always dreamed of.
You're not my daughter.
You're...
How could you say such a thing?
- You made me who i am.
- No.
Tell me where the emerald is.
Not while there's still a breath in my body.
Raw sorry...
Raw run away.
Raw scared.
We all scared.
Don't let them do this to kalm.
He needs us.
Needs you.
Sleep.
This one will read the girl next.
Take him to the gilded hall
for initialization.
No!
Oh, please...
Try again.
Lylo...
Lylo?
Raw?
What are you looking at?
I have a theory which can't be unproven.
Mystic man?
You're alive!
It is called...
The "or not" theory.
Oh, i have so much to tell you.
Ah, ah, ah...
You know that they wouldn't put you
in a cell near mine
unless they wanted to hear us talk.
She's.
She's listening?
First, you must journey to the north, or not.
Yes, i journeyed to the north.
I went to the ice palace,
and i know who my mother is.
Are you sure you're not still on the vapors?
I've never been clearer in my whole life.
It's all coming back to me.
My troubled childhood,
a rich life of scholarly pursuit,
my brief but glamorous life
in show business,
although that part is a little bit hazy.
Did you feel that?
Yeah.
They're testing a machine.
What sort of machine?
The complete destruction of the O.Z.
Is that why she needs the emerald?
O...Kay.
What are we going to do?
There is so much i would like to tell you,
but.
Azkadellia's eyes and ears
are all over us now.
Okay.
Tell me what you know about the...
The gray gale is a myth...
Dreamt up by the ancients
to entertain their children.
Time to change tack.
Long time no see.
Azkadellia?
A little older, a lot smarter,
and most definitely still in charge.
Nothing like a violent coup
to win the hearts and minds of a kingdom.
Good.
You still have a memory.
It may be the one thing that can save you.
What do you want?
What i want is the very thing
you've devoted your feeble life to.
Magic, my friend.
Those who can't do, teach.
Remember?
Your freedom for your help.
My help?
I mean, i'm not saying
they called me twinkle toes, or anything,
but i cut quite a rug.
Oh, you can make a face, cain,
but it's true.
There was a time
when i was a fantastic dancer.
She may have taken my brains,
but rhythm!
That comes directly from your--
do you have any bright ideas
how to get in there?
I mean, i don't mind
taxing my half brain for dg,
but just once i wish that someone
would acknowledge me for my rhythm,
which as i was trying to say
before i was so rudely interrupted,
comes directly from the soul.
Sometimes, cain, you make me feel
just like those ladies at the dance did,
like i blend right into the wallpaper.
That's a good idea.
You want to dance?
I'll lead, you follow.
What i can tell you
is that your mother cloaked your memories
in magic,
so that azkadellia
cannot get to them.
Great.
The only thing is, neither can i.
Yes, you can.
You know what, my mother was really
good with the "to-do" list,
she just wasn't so good
with the "how-to-do" lists.
She said
you must unlock your memories.
Your light must brighten a place
that is dark.
In the south.
It's where you'll find a message
about your future
and your past.
Fiery, aren't they?
Never seen 'em that large.
Left, left!
Left, right, left!
Left, left!
Left, right, left!
You're a deep well, glitch.
It's all about rhythm.
Come on, let's go.
So eager to please the wrong sister.
Azkadellia...
As i live and breathe.
So far.
I don't know which is more pathetic,
you on the vapors or off.
Your sister is more powerful than you.
She will never...be as powerful as me.
Then why are you so scared?
I know you...
Witch.
What do you know?
Stop, az!
Stop it!
Unlock your memories.
Not so great and terrible after all, huh?
Hey!
Do i know you?
Hey...
Thanks.
My friend's this way.
Dg?
Dg!
Raw!
Are you okay?
Let's get you out of here.
longcoats.
That could bust a zipper.
Glitch...
Hey there, princess.
Cain, you're alive!
Barely.
Furry lips here really packs a punch.
We've got to get out of here.
Well, we can't get out
the way we came in.
This way.
Come on.
Dg!
Which way?
Which way?
You're taking directions from a dog.
Left or left?
I've got them, sir!
Longcoats!
I think he wants us to go in there.
I think we'd better hurry.
Let's go.
You're a good boy!
You knew the way!
It's okay.
It's okay, i'm a friend,
i'm a friend of your mother's.
She sent me to help.
We'd better go.
We've got an emerald to find.
Good, good.
Are you ready, kid?
Yeah.
That machine that we escaped through?
The mystic man said that
she was going to use that to destroy the O.Z.
Wait a second.
You saw the mystic man?
He's dead.
She killed him.
He said that she needs the emerald
to make the machine work.
That's interesting.
How?
Folks...
I suggest we keep moving.
Sorry, pooch, but this is
where we part company.
Part?
With the longcoats on our trail
and the mobats in the sky,
i don't have time to figure out
what your angle is in all of this.
My angle is her mother sent me to help.
And you did.
I'd even thank you for what you did back there
if i knew who you were, or what.
Whoa.
Mr.Suspicious, this is the man...
Dog...
Thingie...
Who helped us escape!
- Shape-shifter.
- Yes.
Yes, Mr.Raw.
He knew your name.
How did you know his name?
I know all of your names.
You're Mr.Glitch,
former advisor to the queen herself,
Mr.Raw,
a viewer of extraordinary skill,
and you, Mr.Cain
you were a tin man
on the mystic man's protection detail.
You're all quite famous in the O.Z.
And quite in demand.
Dead or alive.
That is a terrible picture of me.
Mmm...
Now, look, i'm sorry
if i scared any of you back there,
but there's never really a great time
for the old beast-into-man moment.
You just...Wham!
And hope for the best.
I don't know.
You're still a stranger.
Am i?
Let's just see about that.
Hey, that's mine.
It was yours when you were a child.
Whoa.
Am i really doing this?
Indeed you are.
Magic's in your blood.
Let it shed light on your past
so that you may better face your future.
Now, concentrate, dg.
Concentrate.
Concentrate, dg.
You must let the light
flow through you effortlessly.
Remember, light as air.
To...
It's tutor.
Now, focus.
I am, but this thing won't float!
It will.
It wants to.
Just concentrate, deeg.
Yes!
Yes!
Tutor.
You were our tutor.
Before you were sent over
to the other side,
your mother put a spell
on all of your memories,
in case you were ever taken
into the wrong hands.
So i've been told.
Well, she sent me now to help you reawaken
the memories you'll need to find the gray gale,
and the emerald of the eclipse.
Wait, how did you see her
if she's in azkadellia's prison?
She came to me in a dream,
but she's growing weaker and weaker.
There's no time to waste.
Mystic man said to head south.
Then that's exactly what we should do.
Don't you think, cain?
South?
Yes, that's-that's what i meant.
Excuse me.
South.
Unfortunately, the only road to the south
leads through the fields of p-pay.
P-Pay...
- I should kill you!
- Shh!
She's in conference.
And i will.
I will...
My men just told me
that wyatt cain is alive.
He was here.
If she finds out.
Finds out what?
That you're utterly incapable
of putting one man in his grave?
I shot him out a window
into a freezing lake.
That man has nine lives.
He's not the only one.
Xora...
That's my girl.
She's heading south.
My men will blitz the area immediately.
No, they won't.
You have them dead to rights,
and you don't want to take her?
No.
I want her to lead me straight
to the emerald.
You've planted a spy.
Just keeping an eye on her,
as any concerned big sister would.
I want you to shadow her.
Don't get too close.
Think you can handle
a little restraint, zero?
That can't be good.
Hunter parties are out.
Stay sharp.
Did it always look so dead?
No, this used to be some of
the most fertile land in the O.Z.
So, what happened?
Well, about 15 annuals ago,
all the crops died,
which then caused a great famine.
I bet i can guess who's responsible.
Yeah.
You'd think somebody would've helped them
with their crops, maybe...
Engineered a doohickey with a couple...
Thingies...
Got to love a good orchard.
Papay once peaceful.
Yeah?
Well, now the only peace
they're interested in is a piece of us!
Were farmers.
Now hunters.
No wonder they're desperate.
- They don't have any food--
- shh, shh!
Runner scouts.
They're signaling to the others.
Run!
Ah!
Good boys.
Good boys.
Com it's almost dinner-time.
Dg...
Use your gift.
To do what?
Focus, dg.
You've got it in you.
I don't know how.
Just focus.
It isn't working.
Why are they bowing?
Thanking us.
That is one heck of a defense, kid.
Good, dg.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.Easy...
Thank you.
Let's go, let's go.
Dg, my darling.
You're shaking like a leaf.
What's wrong?
She fell, and i let go.
Oh, what are you talking about?
There's az right there.
You okay?
Yeah.
It looked like you were
having a nightmare, a bad one.
Dg dream of azkadellia.
Yeah.
She told me once that we were
friends when we were little,
and i didn't believe her,
but now i'm not so sure.
Maybe your dream's trying
to tell you something.
In my dream, i'm scared,
and my mother is rocking me on a swing...
In a special place.
A beautiful place by a lake.
Well, there's about a hundred
lakes just south of here.
-Dg know which lake.
-No, i don't.
Yo u do, dg.
Because you were there before,
as a little girl.
Try.
What was it like?
It was...
magical.
To get to lake country,
we have to cut across the crack in the O.Z.
This ain't going to be easy.
I brought you a gift.
Bulgar novi.
Once extinct in the fields of the papay.
I thought i'd never enjoy
their fragrance again.
I suppose some things
thought dead aren't always so.
Save the poetry for someone who cares.
What do you want?
The little witch is reconnecting with her past.
Then hope lives.
And what about you, azkadellia?
Perhaps dg isn't the only one
who needs to unlock her memories.
I'm only concerned with the future.
Then why are you here talking to me?
Why have you locked me away for all
these years, kept my hope alive?
To see your face the day that hope dies.
Can't we rest?
I'm tired.
No time.
We have to get to finaqua.
I'd give my last synapse for a juicy apple.
-Apples...
-What is it?
Something azkadellia said.
We'd explore the woods, gather apples...
Clever how you tricked that
old tree to throw fruit at us.
I heard tell of it once
in a story from the past.
We should get back before mother realizes
we're gone, or we'll be history, too.
We are not supposed to be out here alone.
She says there's wild animals in the forest.
Did you say what kind of wild animals?
Lions, and tigers, and...
Oh my!
Just hold my hand, deeg!
Nothing can hurt us if we stay together!
Azkadellia, what happened to you?
Hey, kiddo...
Are you coming?
Yeah.
They won't be puttin' a zipper on that gaper.
Longcoats everywhere.
Yeah, we're not getting past
them in broad daylight.
The eclipse is almost upon us.
We don't have any time to waste.
Look, quick and dead might
be okay with you, dogman,
but i'll take slow and breathing any time.
Even then, we're going to need some help.
Cabin.
Probably full of longcoats.
No.
Look at the smoke.
So they lit a fire.
Longcoats get cold, too.
It's blue.
Come on.
State your business.
We mean you no harm.
We're travelers of the realms seeking
a warm meal and a cold cup of grog.
Food is scarce this time of year,
and the grog has long since been seized.
Then we will leave you in peace.
May your hearth be warm.
And your smoke be blue.
Come in, quickly.
Thank you...
For your help.
I'm that's my wife, lorraine.
Put your gun on the table.
They're friends, lorraine.
No such thing anymore.
It's okay.
We just need shelter till it's safe to cross.
It's never safe.
But the cover of night will help.
Until then, sit, rest.
Newom the resistance in the east?
Well, i was hoping that you would tell us.
Do you know anything about a machine
that azkadellia's building?
Only rumors.
We helped a captain from the lowlands.
All he said was that azkadellia
was pushing the miners
and the metalworkers till they dropped.
What mine?
Some mine in the black mountains.
Mauritanium.
Big "m", little "t".
Number 216 in the ozian periodic table.
School dys.
-I remember a lovely lass named leona who-
- mauritanium.
What's it for?
Besides its strength, mauritanium is valued
for its ability to conduct magical energy.
So if she gets ahold of the emerald,
she can focus the power however she wants.
Not if we get to it first.
So it's a weapon.
No, it's a sunseeder.
What's a sunseeder?
I don't know, but it sounds cool.
Oh, wait...
I invented it.
What's it used for?
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I'm sorry, we don't have time for this.
We have to know.
Raw?
Calibrating the sequencing is a delicate process.
Will it work?
It will work perfectly, sorceress.
You have planned well,
and nothing will stand in your way.
|???
I'm not so sure about all this.
Glitch...
If azkadellia's building
a machine that you designed,
you might be the key to stopping her.
I am talking about fluffy
diving into my cranium.
Invasion of my privacy and all...
Dark day.
Majesty, i bring bad news.
The princess azkadellia has seized central city.
Have our men pull back.
To the south.
What?
The fourth brigade has fallen.
General lonot has defected.
He was our most loyal friend.
I'm so sorry.
There was no law other than azkadellia's.
She tried to steal the plans for the sunseeder.
But i was able to destroy the blueprints.
She'll come after you, ambrose.
Is there nothing you can do, majesty?
Too late.
The darkness is too deeply rooted in her.
But your light.
You are the most powerful being in all of the O.Z.
Was, old friend.
I gave my power and my light
to save someone very special.
My angel...
Show some respect.
The queen's reign ends today.
Do you have any idea what you are doing?
I do.
You need a long rest, mother.
Take her away, and take him to the alchemist.
If you won't tell me what you know,
i guess i'll just have to
reach in and take it myself.
Remove the brain slowly.
No...
Please don't-don't do this.
Please, it won't-it won't work.
-Please.
-Count back from 100.
please...Please!
99...
Don't do it.Don't...
98...
97...
96...
Oh, my...
Uh, the name's glitch, have we...
Are you okay?
Yes, glitch, i'm fine.
What?
Was my machine so bad?
No.
But whatever it is,
you sure sacrificed a lot to stop azkadellia.
That's why she had to go straight to the source.
Oh, i guess it wasn't the biggest
sacrifice ever made for science.
But it sure is up there.
The time to go is now.
Full dark and the moons have yet to rise.
You okay?
I'm disappointed in myself.
My mother gave up her power
to bring me back to life,
and that's how azkadellia was able to take over.
You know, kiddo,
there are some things in life that are just...
Out of our control.
But we need you.
You got to let it go.
Come on.
-Where did you get this?
-We should go.
Where did you get this?
A resistance fighter made it for my son.
He came through a few months
back with his mother.
I think their names were-- jeb...
And adora.
My family, they really are alive.
You're a lot like her, you know.
She wasn't always all ermine
robes and "thee's" and "thou's".
She started out just like you.
Feisty but fair.
My mother's done so much for me,
and i don't even know her name.
Oh, well, that's easy.
Her name was queen...
It's okay.
But she was happy to make the
sacrifices she thought were right.
We should all love someone that much.
Come on.
Quickly.
Help me with this.
Come on.
We hide it as best we can.
Good.
Get it all.
There is not much time.
Your family crossed this same line, friend.
Said they were headed to an old cabin
about three spans on the other side,
tucked behind a giant white elm,
the only one there.
Thank you.
-We should thank you.
-All right, come on.
I'm too big for that thing.
Did i ever tell you i was afraid of heights?
You were hanging from
the ceiling when i met you.
Involuntarily!
If you shape-shift, i swear i'll drop you
-You okay?
-Yeah.
All right, let's go.
There.
That's it.
That's where my family made their new home.
I really don't think there's time for this.
He's always made time for us.
Adora!
Jeb!
Adora!
Jeb
They crossed the gorge.
Why continue south?
Nothing there but wasteland and...
Finaqua.
That's the first place you searched
for the emerald years ago.
It seems the light is
helping the pure of heart.
Zero awaits your orders.
Should he ride to finaqua?
No, and tell him not to get too close.
Your son, jeb, still lives.
No.
He lives to honor you.
I feel it.
You feel too much.
Come on, let's get a move on.
You've sent her into the heart of darkness,
mother.
Why finaqua?
She needs to know what she's up against.
Which way now?
Well, both ways head south.
Your mother said your memories
would guide you, dg.
Let them.
I don't know, it looks familiar.
Well, dig deeper.
Remember, dg.
I remember...
Her swinging me on a swing,
and the suns reflecting in my eyes,
and the breeze off the water.
Oh, what's that?
No!
Sorceress!
Water.Water...
Right away.
Xora?
What happened?
Little beastie just came out of nowhere.
Why did it attack now?
Probably a random hit.
It's dead now.
Great.
Maybe we should just move
along like it never happened.
Never happened?
Once az finds out that this one's missing,
she's going to have longcoats crawling
all over the zone looking for it.
All the more reason to get moving.
You okay?
You're sweating up a storm.
I'm fine.
I know.
Come on!
What is this?
-She's found something.
-Come on.
This way, come on.
Dg!
Where are we?
Dg this way.
Dg?
Where is she?
-I just saw her.
-Where?
Dg!
Come on, come on.
You were right about the magical waters, dg.
That's what "finaqua" means
in the ancient's language.
Not sure about the translation now though.
This used to be paradise.
Not paradise now.
It was one of the first places
az scorched when she came to power.
Well, she sure didn't leave much.
No.
Your adventures have a way of
getting me into trouble...
What was that?
Wait, guys, let her find it alone.
two little princesses dancing in a row
spinning fast and freely on their little toes
where the light will take them
they will never know...
did you hear that?
Hear what?
Let's go see what it is.
No, we should get back.
Mom said to stay close.
If we did everything mom said,
we'd never have any fun.
Come on, it's like an adventure.
Your adventures have a way
of getting me into trouble.
two little princesses dancing in a row
spinning fast and freely on their little toes
where the light will take them
they will never know
two little princesses dancing in a row
dancing in a row dancing in a row...
Remember.
Help!
Do you hear that?
We should go get mom and dad.
Your adventures have a way
of getting me into trouble.
Hello!
Look at this.
It's the picture language of the ancients.
N you tell what it means?
Some.
At the dawn of time, good battled evil,
and the light conquered over the darkness,
and something about an evil witch...
Well...
That was fun.
Wait.
What is this place?
It looks ancient.
Maybe it's a tomb.
I'm not sure, but that face creeps me out.
Let's go.
Don't you t?
there's someone trapped in there.
Dg!
What have we done?
Hey, are you okay?
No, wait.
How did you get re?
Help me!
Our parents aren't far.
We'll go and bring back help.
No!
I mean...
Please, don't leave me alone.
I've been waiting...
Calling.
I thought this day would never come.
The magic is strong in you.
Let go.
No.
-Don't let go.
-But i'm scared.
We have to stay together.
Yo u can let go, little girl.
No.
T go no!
Dg my darling, you're shaking like a leaf.
What's wrong?
Az...
She fell, and i let go.
What are you talking about?
There's az right there.
Azkadellia, are you all right?
Of course, mother.
I've never felt better.
I'sisorry, mer.
All the terrible things that have happened,
they were all my fault.
I should never have let go.
Excuse the interruption, sorceress,
but without xora's reports,
zero would like to know if you'd
wish him to pick up the trail.
I will pick up the trail myself.
Find her.
