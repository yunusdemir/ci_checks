Here, fellas. It's Sweetums' birthday.
Sign his card.
I'm not signing.
Birthdays are just a bogus holiday
created by greeting-card companies.
Hey, be nice. No dirty drawings.
Oh.
Maybe I can make it into a saxophone.
Give me that. Give me that.
I am a writer. I will sign for all of us.
Stand back!
[Grunts]
Wow! That is very impressive.
Oh, you should see me in the shower.
- 10 seconds...
- In, out, everything's clean.
- [Laughs]
- [Blows]
Hey, guys! You're not gonna believe this.
I just got an e-vite to a
party at Jay Leno's house!
Oh, I get those spam e-mails all the time.
You know, from my
"mother" who's "stuck overseas,"
"needs money."
You just delete them.
Uh, Gonzo, isn't your
mother on a South American cruise?
Yeah, and I'm a little worried. I
haven't heard from her in a while.
No, no, this is real.
I <i>know</i> Jay Leno!
We met last month at a
celebrity golf tournament.
Kermit! We got a big problem with Piggy!
She's... there's a...
Scooter, Scooter, listen. Relax, relax.
We talked about overreacting to things.
- It's a code red.
- Aah! Code red!
Oh, my God!
This is not a drill!
[All screaming]
We've created a color-coded
alert system to track Piggy's moods.
Green... she's calm.
But we've never been at green.
Yellow... she's in tears.
Orange... <i>I'm</i> in tears.
But with a code red, if she locks eyes
with you, it's already too late.
Who replaced my thick
sharpies with fine-tipped sharpies?!
I'm signing autographs, not
writing the Bible on a grain of rice!
I have a feeling this
isn't about pen thickness.
[Crashing]
So, I was fitting Piggy for a new dress...
Oh, no, no. You forgot to cut out the tag?
- She knows her size?!
- Oh, please.
I've woven such a cocoon of lies,
she doesn't know her size, weight,
or even how old she is.
Look at this nonsense!
Pencils, highlighters, a backscratcher?!
If you're itchy, take care of it at home!
What is going on?
The People's Choice Awards are coming up,
and she doesn't have a date.
Shocking. She seems
like such pleasant company.
[All laugh]
Piggy: How dare you try to
calm me down with cake?!
Give me that cake! [Whimpering]
[Door slams]
W-wait here.
[Grunts]
Clear.
[Grunts]
Oh.
Whoa!
[Whimpers]
I tried to offer her a ballpoint.
[Whimpers, sighs]
[Thud]
You've got to find that pig a date.
Mm-hmm.

[Ding]
♪ Ooh! ♪
Yeah!

Hmm. Time to get things started.

ha ha ha!
You know, um, my
optometrist would love to date Piggy,
and he's pretty attractive.
At least I <i>think</i> he
is. My glasses aren't very good.
It can't be just anybody, Scooter.
She needs to walk down that red
carpet with somebody famous.
- Hmm.
- Somebody that makes her look good.
So, where are we with Jeff Goldblum?
On with Goldblum's peoples now.
I'm not just gonna book a
random famous guy and hope for sparks.
I have an edge because Piggy's
my ex-girlfriend,
and, uh, when we were dating, we had
one of those free-pass lists, you know?
It was just for fun.
Well, I mean, unless Lea Thompson and I
got stuck in an elevator together.
[Chuckles]
Hmm.
Holding, holding.
Yeah?
Goldblum's married! [All sigh]
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. <i>Happily</i> married?
Aw, rats.
Hey! There's a rat sittin' right here!
Ah, don't be so sensitive.
You guys started The Plague.
Okay, guys, throw
everything we've got at Keanu Reeves.
Got it. [Grunts]
Keanu Reeves says he's in.
- [All gasp]
- Oh, no, no.
Oh, he's put on 100 pounds.
He's doing a movie about that
Hawaiian ukulele player.
- [All groaning]
- Hey, guys! Hey, guys!
It's that time of year again.
I'm selling cookies for my daughter's troop
so she can win a mountain bike.
We are only interested if
you've got a box of dreamy dates.
Ooh! Well, uh, uh, the
fudge-alongs have raisins.
I mean, they're not dates,
but they are also a sun-dried fruit.
Not now, Bobo.
Oh. No problem.
I'll just take the battery out of
your car to remind you to come see me.
- Yeah.
- Hey!
Let's call Josh Groban next.
He's single, he's got a great voice,
and he gives me the feels.
[Gasps] He gives me the feels, too!
What?
He's a handsome man, and gender is fluid.
Scooter: All right, so,
what do you say, boss?
I book Josh Groban on the
show and we hope for the best?
I think we can do better than hope.
Kermit has cooked up some kind of plan
to make the Grobans and Piggy
fall in love during the music.
It's a stupid idea, but I love it.
[Chuckles]
Mostly because I love love.

[cheers and applause]
Woman: Bravo!
Whoo!
Did you just say "whoo"?
What? I'm allowed to feel things.
- Hm.
- [Laughs]
Newsman: As a newsman, I report
on a world full of famine and war.
But you guys buying
cookies for my daughter will
show her that the
human spirit is still alive.
Plus, every box I sell makes
me look better than my ex-wife.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Oh!
What are you doing here?
You got a whole news
building across the street to sell to.
Gentle newsman confronted by large bear.
Will he allow himself to be intimidated?
The answer... coming up...
E-e-eh...
now!
Ohhhh!
[Growls]
[Sighs]
Good morning, everybody.
So sorry I'm a little
late, but for some reason,
it's just so hard to get
out of bed these days.
Der piggan de gropin' de Groban.
Oh, chef! You have a naughty mind.
But accurate.
[Giggles]
- Oh, kermie.
- Yeah?
Can you come by my
dressing room for a moment?
Whenever you get a sec. No rush.
Sure.
Now, I'm not saying that
I solved everything
because Josh took Piggy to
the People's Choice Awards,
but if they ever build an
executive producers hall of fame...
I think you'll be entering
through the Kermit the frog pavilion.
Hmm-hmm! Hm.
- Beaker!
- Aah!
Did you get a haircut?
Unh-unh.
Well, don't. It's the perfect length.
You look cute as a button.
[Gasps]
Mnnnnn!
Kermit: I mean, since
they've been going out,
I've been waking up to the sound
of my alarm instead of my own screams.
Do you know what that means?
For the first time
ever, we're at a code green!
Yaaaaaay!
So, Josh was over last night.
And we were cuddled up on
the couch, watching the show.
Thanks for that picture.
Anyway, he has some ideas.
What? About the music?
That man is more than just a musician.
[Chuckles] <i>Way</i> more.
Yeah, yeah, I get it...
He's a world-class cuddler.
I meant he's also a producer.
And he thinks I could be presented
in a smarter, more sophisticated way.
Like, I could interview authors.
Piggy, I suggested bringing on an author.
I even gave you her book.
And I'm halfway through.
That was five years ago. She's dead now.
Oh, good. I don't have to finish it.
Look, Piggy, you want an
author, I'll get you an author.
- Oh. One more thing.
- Yeah?
Josh and I were
thinking... And I agree with us...
That it would be divine if
the band went acoustic.
Acoustic? They're called the
<i>Electric</i> Mayhem.
Yeah, yeah, I know, but our audience
needs a gentler, more tranquil
vibe at night to help them sleep...
Like a warm glass of milk.
This is a television
show! It is not a glass of milk!
Don't you think if we
tried, it can be both?
Well... we...
Oh! A loose thread!
Milk?
Ooh! Uh, you want some cookies with that?
Oh! Yummy cookies!
[Playing slow-tempo, acoustic music]
[Both snoring]
[Snorts, grunts]
[Song ends]
[Scattered applause] [Sighs]
Piggy: The Electric Mayhem, everybody.
What was that one called, Dr. Teeth?
- "Dead inside."
- Mm-hmm.
- We wrote it today.
- Yeah.
Mm. Very sophisticated.
And we're back, with author Reza Aslan.
Reza, tell me... you
write so eloquently about History.
Where do you get your ideas?
Oh, well, it's History,
so these are things that
have actually happened.
So you <i>don't</i> use your
imagination. That's fascinating.
A little lazy... But fascinating!
You know, when I read a magazine...
My mother's stuck in a jungle somewhere,
and, yet, I <i>know</i> <i>she's
having a better time.</i>
[Bobo chuckles]
Does it make you angry
that libraries are giving
away your book for free?
You get nothing, while
libraries make millions?
I don't... Think that's right.
I totally agree.
The libraries have had
it too good for too long!
[Mid-tempo music plays,
indistinct conversations]
[Fozzie sighs]
I can't believe this.
I'm inside Jay Leno's house,
and nobody's calling the cops!
Oh!
Look at this! Look at
this! Are you getting this?
It's Jay Leno's notebook.
[Gasps]
I bet all of his amazing
jokes are written in here.
Oh!
"Call exterminator."
"Make doctor's appointment."
I mean, two great set-ups right there!
[Chuckles]
He probably keeps his
punchlines in another book...
You know, for security reasons.
Fozzie! You made it!
[Chuckling] Oh, wow!
That means a lot coming from you, Jay.
So, look... If people ask,
am I allowed to say I went to
my friend Jay Leno's house?
- I mean, we're friends, right?
- Of course we're friends.
[Sighs] Look at me! I'm best
friends with Jay Leno!
- [Laughs]
- Come here, you!
Yeah! Oh!
Hey, hey, you're getting fur on my pants.
You kiddin'? I'm getting
Jay Leno on my fur!
Boy, this guy is great. He's
like the comeback kid.
[Laughs]
- Hey, listen.
Check out the bathroom in the entranceway.
- Yeah?
- All right?
It's one of those Japanese deals.
Does everything for you. It's unbelievable.
I'll make sure to drink a
lot of water while I'm here, too!
Yeah! [Laughs]
Ohh!
I was just talking toilets with Jay Leno!
Oh! I never want this day to end!
I need a souvenir.
[Gasps]
Bobo: Morning meeting, everybody.
- Here you go. Thank you for your patronage.
- Morning meeting.
Morning meet...
Seriously?
You actually came back?
Yes, I did, and for
more on this breaking story,
let's go to me, outside!
- [Whimpers]
- What...
You know, you're supposed to buy cookies
from <i>me,</i> not <i>him.</i>
I'm new!
I don't understand the
politics around here!
Ahhhm! Num-num-num-num!
Ahhhm!
Morning meeting,
everybody. Morning meeting.
Pepe: Interesting.
Jay Leno's candy dish.
Oh! If this candy dish could talk...
Yeah, you would have a talking candy dish,
and maybe that would have
been impressive, okay?
You're not worried about getting caught?
Those rich people have security
cameras everywhere!
Yeah, but he wouldn't care about a bowl.
I mean, he probably put it
out so I <i>would</i> take it.
What about that theory, huh? Eh? Eh?
[All groan]
Eh?
Huh?
Oh, God!
Kermit: Good morning, everybody.
- Oh, <i>buenos dias</i>.
- Good morning, Kermit.
Hey, guys, listen, I know that, uh,
last night's show was... pretty awful.
- Yeah.
- Yes, it was.
But that one's on me.
I set Piggy up with that horrible, evil...
Incredibly talented, velvet-throated
piano god.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.
But don't worry. Tonight,
I'm getting rid of Groban.
- What?!
- No, no, no!
Don't get rid of Groban!
Why not? He's ruining the show.
Oh, that's true.
Quality-wise, the show was prison sushi.
Ah, but the rest of the
day with Piggy being all chill?
That was <i>gas-station</i> sushi.
And we love us some gas-station sushi!
- All right!
- [Laughter]
Oh, yeah, Piggy's been so great, I've
been skipping my pre-show cry.
<i>You</i> pre-show cry?!
<i>Animal</i> pre-show cry!
Wait a minute. W-what are you saying?
You actually want Groban to stick around?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
Listen to what she
wrote in my birthday card.
"Your presence is like
a glissando in my heart,
cascading sunshine into my soul.
Piggy."
Yolanda: Really?
Last year, all she wrote on my card
was "large vanilla latte, extra foam."
Yes, but, see, that's our Piggy.
You know, what she wrote in his card
is Piggy under the influence of Groban.
- Hm.
- Hm.
I can't let this happen,
guys. I got to get her back.
[Sighs]
Hey, there's, like, 20 of
us. Why didn't we stop him?
Hmm.
Perhaps our happiness has made us too soft.
- Ooh.
- Interesting.
[Telephone rings]
- Hey, you!
- Whaa! Dyaah!
- You got a message from Jay Leno.
- Oh. Uh, d... okay.
What did he say?
He said he wants to see you at his house!
Was he mad, or is that just you?
I take messages. I don't judge tone!
[New age music plays]
- Yes?
- Oh!
Uh, what are you... W-where's Piggy?
Oh, she's, um, right in the middle of
getting a hot-stone massage right now.
Can I help you?
[Muffled] Ah, warm. That feels good.
Piggy?
I-I got to talk to her.
Oh, anything you need to say to
my lady, you can say to <i>me.</i>
Okay, then. Fine.
The guy you're dating is
an absolute nightmare,
- and you got to get rid of him.
- Oh, yeah?!
Well, you're a little insecure swamp rat
who doesn't know what he's talking about!
Uh...
That was her response to you,
not mine. I think you're terrific.
Would you stop trying
to turn Piggy into you?
I... wouldn't the world be a better
place if everybody was a little more like me?
- Out of my way, dork. I'm going in.
- I don't think so.
Oh, you don't think so? Really? Really?
Because I think you're
forgetting that I am a frog, and I can jump!
[Groaning]
- [Thud]
- Ouch!
See ya, frog.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow! Hot rocks! Hot rocks!
Get them off!
- [Sighs]
- [Sniffs]
Somebody cookin' de bacon.
[Sighs] Look, I know what I did was wrong,
and there's only one
way to make things right.
[Sighs]
I'm just gonna sneak it back in.
Jay will never even know I was th...
[Bowl shatters]
Okay. That's a setback.
Fozzie. Take a seat.
Uh... take it?
I t... I... I don't take things.
E-e-especially things that
don't belong to me.
So I will <i>sit</i> in the seat,
good sir, but I will not <i>take</i> it.
Look, I don't know what
you're on, but listen.
How would you like to open for
me next week in Las Vegas?
W-wait. <i>That's</i> why I'm here?
Well, yeah. You're one of the good guys.
You're not one of these guys that,
you know, steals my stuff.
Steals your stuff? W-what
do you mean by that?
My jokes... my material. You don't t...
[Chuckling] Oh! Right!
No, of course not. I-I never steal jokes!
Jokes... never!
[Chuckles nervously]
- So you'll do it?
- Open for Jay Leno?
- Yeah.
- That's my dream!
Great. I'll get some
champagne. We'll celebrate.
- [Claps hands]
- Okay!

Da-da-da-da-da-da ♪
This is one of the
greatest moments of my life!
I wish I had a...
souvenir to remember this day.
[Refrigerator door opens]
[Glasses clink]
[Grunting]
What are you doing with my brass rooster?
Uh... duh...
I have a brass chicken at
home, and they... belong together?
Look, son, we all have idols.
I've never told anybody this before, but...
I once took a candy dish from
George Carlin's house.
[Chuckles]
I wasn't proud of it.
In fact, I-I still have it.
It's... It's right over here.
Where's my George Carlin candy dish?
It was gone when I got here.
[Chuckles nervously]
You stole my George Carlin candy dish?
You know something,
son? You got a problem. Okay?
Get out. Get out.
Oh!
This is a nice pen. Can I have...
- Get out!
- Okay! Yes, yes, yes!
Sometimes, when I'm <i>really</i>
frustrated and need to clear my head,
I just get into my golf
cart and floor it around the lot.
Speed limit's 5 miles per
hour, but I'll go 6 or 7.
I don't care.
- Hey!
- [Tires screech]
Ooh! Ooh! Oh, my goodness! [Whimpers]
Watch where you're going, frog.
O-o-oh, I'm sorry,
Laurence. Uh, uh...
Hey, hey, when are you
gonna come do the show?
Well, if it keeps on sucking
the way it did last night, never!!
- [Tires squeal]
- [Whimpers]
Uh, yeah, good to see you, too.
Good grief.
[Sighs]
I feel like everything is slipping away...
The show, Piggy... My vertical leap.
[Sighs]
But if this is who she
wants to be, what can I do?
It's her life. It's her show.
Hmm.
Maybe I need to remind her of that.
Hmm.
- Hey, Kermit.
- Yeah?
I just want to say I'm sorry about
what I said about your show sucking.
Yeah?
I just had a really rough night.
Oh, I'm sorry. What happened?
I watched your show, and it sucked!
- [Tires squeal]

[Whimpers]
[Munching]
Carl: Yeah, "Up Late with
Miss Piggy"! What do you want?!
Hey, Bobo!
- Hmm?
- How you doing, buddy?
How are those cookie
sales coming along, huh?
Lousy.
But it did turn out to be a
teaching opportunity for my daughter.
"If you want
something, don't count on Dad."
Well, uh, have you checked with the band?
Uh, I bet, uh, they'd be
happy to buy your cookies.
Hey, hey, hey, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Those guys are <i>always</i> happy!
Yeah. <i>Legally</i> now.
[Animal munching loudly]
[Muttering]
More boxes! More boxes!
Oh! Here you go, animal.
"More boxes"?
Screw the mountain bike. My
daughter's getting a prius.
[Chuckles]
[Grunts]
- Anybody got any...
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Uh-oh.
[Humming]
Where are we going,
Kermit? You can just tell us.
No, it's a surprise.
Listen, guys, I wanted to do
something to make up for how I acted.
See, I-I realize that,
Josh, you do have vision.
And do you know what word
you can't spell without "vision"?
"Visions."
No.
W-well, yes, yes, yes, that's true.
But... but I was going for "television."
And, Piggy, your television show has
changed for the better because of this man.
And that kind of contribution should
not go unrewarded, right?
Okay, guys. What do you think?!
_
I-I love it.
Right?!
Oh, and, Piggy, the best
part is that even though
you're the only female
host on late-night, it shows
you're brave enough to say, "I
can't do it without a man."
[Squeaks]
Hmm.
Bye-bye.
[Breathing heavily]
Piggy: Sometimes, with couples,
when one person is very powerful,
they make the other
person change who they are.
That's what I was doing to Josh.
So I let him go. Next!
[Elevator bell dings]

- Huh?
- You got to hear the story, Kermit!
No, no, no, I can hear it tomorrow,
Gonzo... t-tomorrow.
- Oh, no, no, no, it's really amazing.
- W...
