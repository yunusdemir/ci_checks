Attaboy.
I'm going to

I'll see you

Say hi to
albert for me.
Aw, thanks.
Hello.
It's lorraine,
mrs. Partridge.
How's my boy?
Oh, he's fine. Fine.
Ate all his vegetables tonight,
even his broccoli.
Good. Good.
Well, i need to go to the market,
and i'll be home within the hour.
Is it my mom?
Hold on.
Here comes mr. Magician.
Mom, i did my
hoover dam report.
I'm going to
read it to you.
I'm coming home
to put you to bed.
You can read it
to me then.
I'll just read you
the first part.
"45 miles from las vegas
is the hoover dam.
It is one of the highest
dams of the entire world."
Ooh!
That's my opener.
Oh, it's stupendous!
I'm hooked!
And the rest of it
when i get home.
And i want you to brush
your teeth.
Hi, albert, honey!
It's ruthie.
Hi, ruthie!
Mom.
Yeah?
I'm working on mr.
Antoine's card move...
The rise-And-Fall
move he showed me.
I think i got it.
It's all in the wrist.
It's all in the wrist, and
so is brushing your teeth.
Now, i'll be home soon,
and look, albert,
I want you to be gentle
with mrs. Partridge, ok?
She's brittle.
Ok.
Miss rylander gave me an "a"
on my report on ethiopia.
Great. Wonderful.
"Ethiopia is in the
northern part of africa.
"Children in ethiopia
are very hungry.
There was
a drought there."
That means no rain.
Good work, albert!
I love you.
I'll be home soon, but i want you to
brush your teeth and get into bed.
Ok. Ok.
Ok, promise me?
Promise.
Promise?
Promise.
Ok. I love you.
Love you too,
mom. Bye.
Mrs. Partridge,
i have something to show you.
What...Your room?
Yes!
It's a mess.
Ok,
mrs. Partridge,
I have an empty
brown bag.
Uh-Huh.
I will open the brown
paper bag like this.
Now give me
the ketchup bottle.
Careful you don't
break it.
I won't.
Put the ketchup
bottle in the bag.
Watch!
Uh-Huh.
Say the magic
words...Sim-Sola-Bim.
Poof! It's gone!
Oh, come on, now,
albert.
Nobody's going to
believe that.
Don't like it?
Hee hee hee!

Hello. Is this
the franklin residence?
Yes.
Ma'am,
can we please come inside and talk to you?
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Ma'am, i regret
to inform you
That mrs. Franklin has been involved
in a very serious vehicle accident.
Mom!
"I am
the resurrection and the life.
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,
"Yet shall he live.
"Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die
But have eternal life
and peace forever."
Amen.
Ok. Now.
It is a sad day here.
We are confused.
We do not understand.
Je ne comprends pas.
Tell me, god,
Is life the illusion,
and is death the reality?
What door do you
go through, lorraine,
And where will you
appear again?
Allez. Au revoir,
ma petite.
Bon voyage.
Oh.
"45 miles from las vegas
is the hoover dam.
It is one of the highest dams
in the entire..."
I'm sorry, albert.
Keep reading, baby.
Keep going.
Shouldn't i do this?
It's all right,
mon grand.
Keep reading.
Don't stop, albert.
It's so beautiful.
Yes.
But I'm making
everybody sadder.
It's all right,
mon cheri. Go on.
Go.
No. Everybody's
too sad.
Mother
wasn't sad.
My mother was
never sad!
Why can't we keep him?
We could all...
Babette,
this is not a pet, you know.
But he's so little,
and we love him.
Hey, ruthie,
you must know more about the family.
What about
the father?
Yes, ruthie.
The father.
Father?
The father was
just a fly-By-Night.
She thought
he was magic.
Maybe he was, 'cause
he sure did disappear.
I don't even think
she got his last name.
Grandparents?
She didn't
have any family...
No parents,
no grandparents,
No brothers,
no sisters.
She was raised
in a foster home
Back in newark,
new jersey.
If there's no family,
where will albert go?
Why can't i just
stay here?
Albert!
Honey, we thought you were fast asleep.
Come on, honey.
Let's go back
to bed.
Mr. Antoine said
he was my father.
C'est une facon de parler.
It is
an expression.
He loves you
like a father.
Oui. Je t'aime
beaucoup, albert.
You know
you are my favorite.
We all love you,
albert.
We would like
to take you with us,
But we move around
so much.
We have no maison...
No home...
And a circus
is not a home.
You were going to teach
me to be a magician.
You said i could be
in the act one day.
I've been practicing.
I'm really good with
the a.B.C. Trick,
And i already know the over-The-Falls
and the 50-Cent discovery.
Mrs. Partridge,
you saw me do it.
I fooled you, didn't i?
Yes. You certainly
fooled me.
And my fingers are getting
stronger all the time,
And my wrist.
Look!
See? See?
It's all in the wrist.
To whom it may concern:
in the event of my death,
Please contact my foster sister
harriet franklin.
Even though our lives
have gone separate ways
And it's been many years
since we've spoken,
I've always thought of her as
the godmother of my son albert,
Who i am leaving
in her care.
I believe she will always
be there for albert...
"As harriet and
i were once there for one another.
"She is most likely
still in newark.
I know she'll want to
do the right thing."
Signed,
lorraine franklin.
The boy has a guardian.
It's his godmother...
Harriet franklin.
Any of you
ever heard of her?
Janet, get me directory assistance
for newark, new jersey.
Let me ask harriet, ok?
Hold on. Hold on.
Harriet!
Can you hold on
one second?
What is it?
Mike belasco's claiming we
over-Delivered on the coasters.
Penny, did you remember
to verify the order?
Verbally and in writing,
like you said.
Bob, can you hold on one second?
It's so busy here.
Mike, what's the problem?
No, no, no. We didn't over-Deliver.
You over-Ordered.
What were you thinking,
ordering pink coasters?
You got a cigar manufacturers
convention going on!
No. Hold on a second.
Bob, you still there?
I'll be right with you.
I tell you what.
I'm going to do you a big favor.
You send me back the pink ones,
i'll send you the brown ones,
You pay for shipping.
Ok? I'm going to
put penny on. Penny!
What?
Get on with belasco.
We're finally getting rid of
those goddamn brown coasters.
Bob! Sorry about that.
You know, when you're busy,
the world is on hold.
Now, as i was saying,
i want to get into bigger things, bob.
I want to get into sterilizers
and deep fryers...
To cook things in.
I really feel...
Reliable hotel and restaurant supply.
We're there for you.
Yes?
No. I found a wonderful warehouse.
It's full of inventory.
All you have to do is
come and see it with me.
Make the day. Any day.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You just let me know, ok?
Thanks. Bye-Bye.
One moment, please.
Somebody from las vegas
on line 2?
Something about
lorraine, your sister?
I didn't know
you had a sister.
Hello.
Hello. Miss franklin?
Yeah.
Miss franklin,
my name is clay thrasher.
I'm a lawyer at the hotel where
lorraine franklin has been working.
Uh-Oh. What's wrong?
What, is she
in some kind of trouble?
I'm afraid it's worse than trouble,
miss franklin.
Lorraine was killed last week
in an automobile accident.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Lorraine was killed last week
in an automobile accident.
You are lorraine's
foster sister,
Is that correct,
miss franklin?
You're telling me
lorraine is dead?
Miss franklin,
this is ruth clark.
I was lorraine's
best friend.
We would have
told you sooner,
Except...
We just found out
about you.
We're sorry to break the news
to you this way, miss franklin.
Oh, no. I...
I understand,
and thank you for calling.
No, no. Please
don't hang up.
Miss franklin, there's something
more we need to talk about.
What?
It's about albert...
Lorraine's little boy.
Lorraine had a little boy?
Now, what i have
before me, miss franklin,
Are some documents naming
you the boy's guardian.
What?!
Oh. Oh!
No. No. No.
No. No. I...
Uh-Uh. No.
You know, first you tell me
lorraine is dead,
And now you tell me
she's got a kid,
And then you're going to
spring on me
That I'm supposed
to be responsible for it?
He's not an ordinary
boy, miss franklin.
He's really
a wonderful boy, harriet.
He's a magical boy.
Was that him?
Who was that?
I'm antoine.
Who?
Albert's
good friend.
The problem is that right now,
he is a homeless boy.
Well, what about his father?
We can't find the father.
There is no father.
What do you mean,
there is no father?
The boy wasn't immaculately
conceived, was he?
Listen, you people,
let me explain something to you.
I don't have a motherly bone
in my body, ok?
I'm not a mother.
I don't want to be a mother.
Now, i also assume that this
little boy is white, is he not?
Have you got
a problem with that?
Yeah...Just a small one.
'Cause I'm black,
too, you know,
And i think that your sister
would be damned upset with you
If she thought that you
wouldn't take albert
Because you think that
black gets in the way!
That's not what i said.
It didn't bother
his mother,
And you grew up with white folks,
didn't you?
What has my growing up
with white folks
Have to do with me raising
some little white boy?
It's who you are.
You are the closest thing
that he's got to blood!
You understand
the alternative
Would be to place him in the state system,
miss franklin?
No...
God!
What happens now?
Bye.
Bye, albert.
Bon voyage.
Albert!
Don't you even want to say
good-Bye to your friends?
No.
Bye-Bye,
albert!
Albert, bye-Bye.

You wouldn't be
miss franklin?
Actually,

Oh.
I'm sorry I'm late.
The jackson street bridge was out,
and i couldn't get across.
Yes, I'm sure
that's true.
Well, we have to give ourselves
a little more time these days,
Especially when picking up
such precious cargo.
I'll need to see some

I'm sorry.
Passport, driver's lic...
Thank you.
Boy, do you look

I.D. Is fine.
You have to sign right there.

a card player?
Oh, no.
He's a magician.
He can make
the ace of spades
Turn into
the queen of hearts.
Looks like
he's on sale.
Can i take

Usually the tag's taken off at
the gate when they're picked up.
I said i was sorry.
Mm-Hmm.
Ok. Let me get
your tag off here.
Sorry.
There you go.
Thank you.
So get your backpack

We'll go.
What's

My pillow.
Oh.
Ok. Let's go.
Good luck, Albert.
That's it. No more
shortcuts for me.
I know better.
You know, there's no shortcuts in life.
I'm sure you know that.
I know that.
It's the kind of thing where
you just have to concentrate.
Because i don't
know how i got here.
I'm not sure
i am here.
You know what?
I don't think I'm here.
As a matter of fact,
i think I'm not really here.
As a matter of fact,
I am an alien
space monster,
And I'm going to
eat you up!
Aah!
What's the matter?
My coloring book.
What about it?
I left it
on the airplane.
We'll get you
another one.
I need that one!
Hey, I'm going to
get towed away!
Flight 106 from st. Louis
now arriving at gate 61.
Never mind.
It's ok.
We can go now.
Oh, well,
I'm relieved,
Because we weren't going
back to get a coloring book.
It's all right.
She's nervous.
She's a space monster.
She has
funny hair, huh?
I know.
You know
what?
I don't know.
Oh.
Hey! What are
you doing?
Don't write
that ticket, man.
I had to pick up
the little boy.
He was traveling by himself
in traveller's aid.
Don't you have kids?
No.
Well, listen.
It wasn't that long.
I wasn't here
but 3 minutes.
15.
I was not here
15 minutes.
I would know if
i was here 15 minutes.
Get in the car.
If i was here
15 minutes,
I would not be
fooling around with you.
What are you doing?
Get in!
I wasn't here 15 minutes.
I was here 3 minutes.
Why are you
writing a ticket?
I'm not paying it,
I'm just telling you now.
Don't pay it, lady.
Pay your lawyer.
Do you believe that guy had
the nerve to give me a ticket?
I mean, there's
drug addicts out there,
There's crazy people starting fires,
running around naked,
And what
is this guy doing...
The police department,
our fabulous police department?
Giving me a ticket.
I work every day.
I pay rent.
I could have
been picking up
A loved one
or something.
Oh, loved one.
That sounds good.
Well, can't cry
about it.
Cannot
cry about it.
So...you play
cards, huh?
He does magic.
I do magic.
You do magic,
huh? Good.
Yes, yes. You do
the french pass.
I know.
You know what?
Nothing.
Why do you keep
saying "i know"?
Tell her
you are thinking.
I was thinking.
Oh, good.
That's something we can do together...Think.
Think.
This is it.
277 barrow.
That's where we live.
Can you
remember that?
277.
Yeah.
Now, listen, uh...
277 barrow?
Yeah.
I've always
lived alone,
So we're going to have to have some rules,
ok?
You ok with rules?
Sometimes.
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?
Because if you do,
it's down the hall.
Now, i've only got one,
So we're going to have to
figure out what we want to do.
I don't want you to leave toothpaste
in the sink because it's really nasty.
I'll try not to do
the same thing.
The other thing is i would
really appreciate it
If you would put down
the toilet seat because...
Well, it's just because
it's courteous.
Oh. I gave the mets a pretty
good deal on some coffee mugs,
So they gave me
a baseball.
I have a baseball
signed by liza minelli.
Why would liza minelli
sign a baseball?
The sahara hotel
was playing
The hilton hotel
on sunday.
My mom took me,
and mr. Antoine
Got liza minelli
to sign a ball.
It says, "to my favorite all-Star,
from liza minelli."
Engelbert humperdinck hit
a home run in that game.
Well, you know,
i don't really get engelbert humperdinck.
He's nice.
Picked me up once.
He's strong.
♪ please release me ♪

Are you hungry?
No.
Well, you have to
eat something.
Come in here.
I got us a couple
of tv dinners.
What kind?
Fish cakes.
Fish cakes?
Oh, no.
You like fish, don't you?
It's like brain food.
We like nachos.
Well, we don't
have no nachos.
We have fish cakes.
We have fish cakes with
cauliflower and brownies.
That's what we have.
Here are the plates,
and here are the cups.
Styrofoam?!
They're not
biodegradable.
That's too bad,
because i got 2,500 of them.
They're all misprinted,
so i got stuck with them.
I think it's too early
to talk about biodegradable.
No, no.
She's a polluter.
What?
Nothing.
Why don't i show you
your room?
I want to go home.
She's nervous.
She scares me.
I'll stay by your side
like krazy glue.
Promise?
I never break
a promise.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
Mumbling all the time.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You notice i got you
your own television set,
And if you look
out the window,
You'll see
there's a park.
In the park,
there's a playground.
If anybody says
anything to you, run.
Now, we're looking into
boys' clubs and ys for you
Because I'm going to be
working all the time.
I don't have time to
spend with you, you know,
Because I'm trying
to expand my business.
I'm actually trying
to buy a warehouse supply.
Yeah, well...
We're looking into
summer camps for you, too.
You like summer camp?
My mom took me places
in the summer.
Oh. Well,
i can't do that
Because, obviously,
i have a business to run.
Cupboard's over there.
Bathroom's down the hall.
I put some little mickey
mouse soaps in there for you.
Want to take a bath?
I'll go run you a bath.
I'll run you a bath.
Oh, and don't mess
with the fire escape.
It's off-Limits.
You know, i heard
you're good in school.
Do you like school?
I guess so.
So...you miss
everybody, huh?
Your mom and...
Say yes.
Yes.
Well, you're just going to have to...
deal with it.
You know,
you got to get strong.
Got to learn
to grow up.
You don't always
get choices in life.
Your mom had to do it.
I had to do it.
We had to grow up.
We grew up.
Your mom was
my best friend.
She was my real pal.
You can put your things
away, can't you?
He wants you to tell
him a big hello.
He wants you to tell
him you like his face.
Why don't you
pick him up
And give a big, big
kiss on his face?
I don't want her
to pick me up.
Oh, yes,
you do. Ooh!
No, i don't.
Oh, you cry?
Cry.
Is good to cry.
I won't cry!
I won't watch tv,
And i won't go
to summer camp,
And i won't wash my
hands with mickey mouse.
Maybe minnie?
No.
Goofy?
No. I want
to go home!
But you have
no ticket.
I have
my own money.
It's all here.
I can use it for whatever i want to.
I have my own insurance policy
that my mother left me.
I'm going to be
really rich.
It's for college,
you know?
She doesn't know
anything about baseball.
All she does is
talk about newark.
I hate newark.
I hate it!
She...She...She wants...
she needs a friend, huh?
You should try.
I don't want to try.
Yes, you do.
No, i don't!
Yes, you do.
No, i don't!
Ye...
I want to go back
to vegas.
I don't
like it here.
I don't want to try.
Albert?
Your bath's ready.
Albert, let's go.
It's down here.
I ran a tub for you.
I don't know how you like it,
so maybe it's too hot.
You'll get in
and let me know.
I put some of this in.
It's big bird.
So...it's all ready.
Do you need me
to take your cl...
I can wash myself.
Oh! Great. I'm going
to fix dinner.
I can't live here.
If i live here,
i'll die.
You cannot die.
You just got here.
Besides, if you die,
What will you do
tomorrow?
What will i do?
I could lose my job.
If you die, I'm back waiting for
someone to make me up again.
Back where?
Back where
i come from.
Where's that?
That is where i am
before you make me up.
Hmm?
Before i drew
your picture?
Are there
other people there?
Ooh!
Ooh. Everybody
you can imagine.
My mother?
You should wash
behind the ears.
I want to go home.
I don't
like it here.
I want to see
my mother.
Albert...
Your mother is dead.
I hate that word!
I want to go
to where you live.
This is where
i live, you know?
Here it is.
Where...Where you live,

This is not
where i live.
Is!
Isn't!
Is!
Isn't!
Albert, are you
all right in there?
Huh?
Say yes.
Yeah.
Great. Well, hurry up.
Dinner's almost ready.
She's hungry.
Ha ha ha!
Albert,
dinner's ready.
I'm not hungry.
Well, come on.
It turned out great.
I don't want any.
Come on. You got
to eat something.
I don't want any!
Fine. Fine.
Albert?
Albert, i made you
a sandwich.
This must be harriet.
This is mrs. Franklin,
harriet...Your foster mother.
Hi.
This is your new home.
Come in.
This is harriet,
everybody.
This is mr. Franklin,
Richard, david.
Hello, harriet.
And this is lorraine.
Hi.
You're going to
sleep in my room,
And we can be
best friends.
Albert, are you hungry?
What's
in the sandwich?
Oh!
Peanuts.
Peanuts butter.
No, thank you.
Slow down!
Slow down! No running
in the hallways.
You know the rules.
Ok, ms. Franklin.
I'll take albert to his class.
You can pick him up at 2:45.
Say good-Bye, albert.
Bye.
Listen to
your teachers...
And don't get
into trouble.
I'll be on the steps
at 2:45. Be there.
You hear
what she said?
Yes.
All right.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Good morning,
harriet.
What,
don't i exist?
Good morning,
harriet. So?
How is he?
What's he like?
I don't know.
He's like a little boy.
Does he like his room?
Did you feed him?
He wasn't hungry.
He doesn't like styrofoam cups
Because they're
not biodegradable.
Of course not.
He's a kid.
He's got
convictions.
So? What did
you guys talk about?
What did
he have to say?
He didn't say much of anything to me.
He talked to his friend.
The child is
obviously not alone.
He's got a friend?
Mm-Hmm.
And i can't tell you
anything about him
Because he's invisible
and i can't see him.
I had a little friend
when i was growing up.
Little bitty thing.
Can't remember her name,
But she lived in my ear,
and she wore a tuxedo,
And she whispered things
to me i never knew about.
She made me feel safe.
I couldn't have
survived without her.
Drudella.
Yeah.
That was her name.
Excuse me!
Do i have
any appointments today?
You can see the hudson
brothers at 10:00.
If you want
to drop in on springer,
He's interested in the cocktail
glasses at the march 30th rate.
Did bob morrison call?
He just called.
He can meet you at the warehouse at 3:00.
I have to pick up
albert at 2:45.
You can make it.
I can't. You're going to
have to pick him up.
I got the dentist
at 3:00.
Take him with you.
I'll pick up albert if
you have the root canal.
No! See...i knew this
wasn't going to work out.
This is not
going to work.
I haven't had a
conversation with a child
Since i was a child,
And now i got one
sitting on the steps
Waiting for me
to pick him up at 2:45.
Goddamn!
Maybe she's
not coming.
Listen to him.
She'll come.
There's no one there.
Maybe she'll never come.
This kid's
really nuts.
Let's go.
She'll be mad.
I don't care.
Hey, weirdo,
where are you going?
Hey, albert,
who you talking to?
Come on.
♪ me and my shadow ♪
♪ strolling down the avenue ♪
♪ me and my shadow ♪
♪ i need a friend
to tell my troubles to ♪
That's
a big truck.
Look, look, look!
Hey, fish face!
Hey, look out!
Watch out, kid.
Why wasn't somebody
watching him?
We can't watch them
every minute.
We're doing the best
that we can.
The parents got to assume
some responsibility, too.
You were late.
You know that.
What are you
telling me,
I'm irresponsible because i don't
control the traffic in newark?
You should
have left earlier!
Hey, you 2 kids.
Did you see albert?
You know, the new student.
Did you see him?
He went back
to las vegas.
Talking
to himself.
You cover the streets
and the park.
I'll check out
the yard here.
Don't worry.
We'll find him.
You 2 kids
go on home.
Hey, lady!
Your kid's weird.
Come here.
You want to see
something really weird?
Sure.
Go home and look
at your mothers!
Aah!
Yoo hoo!
Eat lead,
mutant scum!
Aah!
I'm...dying!
Huh!
Aah!
Aah! Ha ha ha!
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!
Aah!
I got you!
Aah!
Aah!
Albert.
Albert!
What are you doing?
Do you know that everybody's
looking for you?
Come on!
What is the matter
with you?
Do you know that the whole
school is looking for you?
And where are you?
Laying here in the park talking to yourself.
You don't even know what
direction you're going.
You live that way.
Hey! Excuse me.
I was here looking for my lost son.
Get in the car.
He was lost. He's just
a little white boy,
Doesn't know
where he's going.
He's trying to
find his way home.
Aren't we all?
No. We all are not.
I know where i live.
I live that way.
I've always known
where i lived.
Please, spare me
any kind of philosophy
You getting ready
to throw.
Hakuna matata.
Disney cartoons
everywhere you turn.
Disney,
disney, disney.
People having conversations
with themselves.
Like you.
You know
how strange you look
Having a conversation
by yourself?
I have a theory
about that.
If i can't see it,
it doesn't exist.
That's because you
don't believe in magic.
Yeah, well...
I don't.
You know why?
Because when i was
a little kid,
They used to have this show
on tv called peter pan.
Had this grown woman in
it named mary martin
Dressed up
like a little boy,
Which i don't even
want to get into now.
So this little fairy
gets sick, right?
Tinkerbell.
She drinks the poison
That captain hook
left for peter.
Yeah. Whoever, whatever.
Anyway, they said, "well,
if you believe in magic,
"Why, then, you just clap your hands,
and she'll get better.
Yeah, if you believe, clap your hands, ooh!
She'll get better."
Let me tell you
something:
I didn't believe, so i didn't clap my hands,
and you know what?
She got better anyway,
Which just goes to show you
there is no such thing as magic.
People just try to make
you believe that there is.
I watched that video
with my mom.
We always
clapped our hands.
Yeah, well...
Ha ha!
You can't believe...
I got caught
in a detour.
You know, they're
tearing up allen street.
Come on, harriet.
Nobody takes allen street.
You take rose,
and you cut across the 92.
So you brought
your bodyguard, huh?
Albert, mr. Morrison.
Hi. Bob.
Come on.
I just want to
show you this.
Isn't this great?
Isn't this spectacular?
Isn't it everything i said
it was going to be?
I mean, it's amazing.
Look at this place!
And you know what's
wonderful about it?
It has its own
2 trucks.
Albert, don't break anything.
I don't own it yet.
And leave
that cat alone.
Bob, so, can you see
what i can do here?
You can make
a lot of soup.
Bob, I'm serious.
I take you
seriously, harriet.
I always did.
You know that.
Well, then,
make the numbers work.
Put it together, bob,
and make it work.
Wow!
Vanilla.
What do you want?
Oh, uh...
strawberry!
Strawberry? What?
Ok, strawberry.
Strawberry.
And chocolate.
Chocolate.
Bananas.

Why wrap yourself up
in this place?
It's like
a big tomb.
All your vitality,
why do you want to bury it in here?
Well, because this
is good, bob.
This is
a good investment.
I'll do my best.
That looks good.
What do you
got there?
A banana split!
Uh-Huh.
May i have a taste?
Mmm!
That's good!
You know,
i have a boy your age.
I'm giving him a birthday
party in a couple of weeks.
Like to come?
Sure.
Good!
You like a party,
don't you, harriet?
Oh, yeah!
Got to go.
Wait a minute, bob.
There's so much i want to show you.
I've seen enough.
I'll run some numbers and get back to you.
So long, albert.
Don't get no
tummy ache.
So long, bob.
Run the numbers, bob.
I'll do the best
i can, harriet.
Ask her if she wants
a banana split.
She won't.
She won't what?
Nothing.
Come on.
Listen, uh...
this is the deal.
I brought him here to
show him all of this
Because i want him to give
me the money to get it.
Now because of you,
we're going to a party,
So i want you
to take bob aside,
And i want you
to say, "bob,
This investment is
great for your bank."
Repeat that to me
right now.
This investment
is great for your bank.
Albert, can i ask
you a question?
Who do you talk to
all the time?
Bogus.
And, uh...where's
your friend come from?
France. He's french.
French.
Oui.
Listen, albert,
i got to tell you.
I'd feel a lot
more comfortable
If you had
some visible friends.
See, then i wouldn't care
If they were from france
or germany or ethiopia.
Tell her about
ethiopia.
Ethiopia is in the
northern part of africa.
Children in ethiopia
are very hungry.
There's a drought there.
That means no rain.
Liza minnelli
went there once
With shirley maclaine.
Mom told me audrey hepburn
made them come.
How do you
know all that?
I wrote a report.
My mom helped me.
You want
a root beer?
You know, albert,
you're so smart.
I...i just don't
think you need
That french guy anymore.
Let me
take care of him.
Say there, mr. Bogus,
i don't think albert...
That's not where he is.
He's not teeny-Tiny?
He's bigger
than you are.
Oh.
Oh! Ha ha!
Of course he is!
Look at him standing right over there.
Listen,
it's time for you to go back to france.
You know,
albert doesn't really need you anymore.
I know! No,
i know that you're not happy here in newark.
You hate newark.
I know you do.
Oh. Well,
no, you agree.
Of course.
Ha ha! Thank you.
Well, it's been real.
Bye-Bye now.
Au revoir.
Voila. He's gone.
You didn't really
see him.
Of course i did.
What was he wearing?
A coat.
A big coat.
A big, french coat.
What color was it?
Brown. He was wearing
a big, french, brown coat,
And he said
to say good-Bye,
So why don't you finish your spaghetti,
have an oreo cookie,
And I'm going to finish
my phone calls, ok?
See, we're working
it out, albert.
Bogus.
Bogus.
Bogus?
Bogus?
Bogus!
Bogus, you can
come out now.
Rrrr...
Oh!
Where were you?
Why did you disappear?
She fooled you.
She fooled me, too,
for a minute.
I thought i was gone.
Pendent une minute,
j'ai cru que j'etais parti.
I don't want you
to leave me again.
That's an order.
Oui, mon general.
You're my friend,
and i want you to always be my friend.
For as long
as you need me.
I'll always need you.
You're my best friend.
My only friend.
You're my mon ami.
I am your
best friend.
I know you better
than anyone.
Better than anyone.
Better than you
know yourself.
Hello.
Hello.
Harriet?
Hello?
Hello.
Would you like
to see me?
Mmm...
Huh!
Albert?
Albert, were you
in my room last night?
No.
Let's go.
Uhh!
Uhh...
Words starting
with "a." Anybody else?
Artichoke.
Artichoke. What
a wonderful word, angela.
That will be
fun to use in a sentence.
I'll show you
how to spell it.
I know how to spell it.
How about alaska?
Good, thomas.
Alaska's a good subject.
It's our country's
largest state.
I know that.
Uh, words
beginning with "b."
Albert?
Bogus.
Bogus. Well, what
a grown-Up word.
Can you tell me
what it means?
It means...
Friend.
I'm afraid that's
not right, albert.
Bogus is a word
you'll use
When you're
a little older.
It means fake.
Something that
is not real.
No, bogus is real.
Bogus is not real.
The word bogus means just
the opposite of real.
It means pretending
to be real.
Something not being
what it seems to be.
It's very important you not
confuse the meaning of words.
Ha ha!
What are you looking at, albert?
What's so funny?
Mmm...nothing.
Well, now, then,
albert,
Can you tell me the correct
meaning of the word bogus?
It means...
Friend.
No, no, no!
Bogus means fake!
Bogus is not fake!
Don't you shout
at me, young man!
No, bogus is real!
He's always been real!
All right.
All right, um...
We'll talk
about this later on.
You can sit down.
Um...we'll go on.
Words starting
with the letter "c."
Oh, right here.
Jeffrey.
Bob morrison's kid's
birthday party.
Uh-Uh. Tell him
I'm in philadelphia.
Oh, come on, harriet.
It will be fun.
It will be good
for albert.
He'll meet other kids.
What scares you about
a birthday party?
Take it out
of my paycheck.
Who said anything
about being scared?
I'm not scared
of anything.
Then what's your problem?
He's 7.
7. His mother died.
He loved her.
He's got to
work it out.
I know he's 7.
I know his mother died.
I also have to
work it out.
But you're not 7.
Some part
of me is 7!
Let the part that's 7
be friends with his 7.
What are you, sigmund freud?
Stop analyzing me.
You are my secretary!
Take the kid
to the party.
Are you ready
for a surprise?
Yeah!
It's me, dr. Surprise!
Yay!
Do you like
surprises?
Yes!
Harriet,

Ha ha ha!
Here's a party hat

I don't...
Uh, yes, harriet.
Yes, yes, yes.
Hey, doug.
Hi, bob.

Long time no see.
Here's a hat for you.
Kid's having a great

Oh, yeah.

I don't...
Come on, harriet.
Have a piece of cake.
This is a nice house.
Well, i got

My wife

Yes. I always thought it
was the other way around.
Listen, um...
about the loan...
It's a party,
harriet.
We'll talk
about it later.
Yay!
Is everybody having fun
at dougie's birthday party?
Yeah!
And now, i want you
to feast your eyes
On the magic closet:
Dr. Surprise's
cabinet of mystery!
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!
The one and only place
that's guaranteed to show you
Things as they
really are.
It's the double-Door
trick.
Magic wand,
oh, magic wand.
Choose, magic wand...
That lovely lady
across the lawn!
Please, come up
and help us.
Yeah, you. Yes.
No. No, thank you.
Get somebody else.
You're the one.
No, I'm not.
Just do your magic trick.
Are we going
to let this lady
Get away from
the magic closet?
No!
Then let's find out
who she really is.
Go and get her!
Ha ha ha!
No! Come on, now!
Stop!
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho ho!
Ow!
I'm sorry. Tell her
i didn't mean to hurt her.
Ok, kids, come on.
Back to your seats.
Come on, right now.
Hurry up, everyone.
Choose me,
dr. Surprise.
I'll do it.
What's the matter
with you, harriet?
I told him i didn't
want to play.
I said no!
Just settle down,
kids. Settle down. Yes.
Are you ready
for another surprise?
Yes!
What am i
supposed to do?
Right into the box,
my little cinnamon bun.
Here is
the big surprise!
Are you ready
in the closet?
Yes, i am, dr. Surprise.
Ha ha ha!
Sim sola bim!
Huh! Momma!
Where's my momma?
Dr. Surprise isn't really
a very good magician.
No, he's not.
That's pretty good.
I hold it this way,
And you can't
see it.
And i do this.
See?
And it drops
down here. See?
It's called
the french pass.
More french, huh?
I've got
a better one.
Mr. Antoine
taught me.
He's the best magician
in las vegas.
Look, i don't have time
for this right now.
I have these bills
i have to pay.
I just really
don't have time.
I hate her!
I hate her!
He wants to show you
a trick. That's all.
Why you
push him away?
And now
you feel so bad.
Harriet, why do you
want to feel so bad?
What is this?
Belasco's 12,456
pink coasters.
I will be so glad when I'm
out of the coaster business.
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.
What's wrong?
Bob morrison
called this morning.
Yeah?
He said the bank won't
give you the loan.
He says he really
wishes he could,
But he doesn't think
He can get it through
the loan committee.
He doesn't think
he can get it through?
Get him on the phone.
He's out of town all day.
You can't reach him.
He gave me
his home number
In case you want to
talk to him later.
I don't want
to talk to him later.
I want to see him
face-To-Face tonight.
Get on the phone,
and tell him i want to see him tonight.
What about albert?
I'll get the lady downstairs.
She'll babysit.
She doesn't charge
for invisible friends.
What's your order?
2 martinis.
Harvey, it seems
that veta is having
A party
this afternoon...
Ohh...
It's a bad idea,
albert.
It's a bad idea.
You can't stop me.
But it's too far.
It's only
2 hours by bus.
I saw it in an ad.
Oh, i don't like this.
It's a bad idea.
Don't follow me.
Do you want to go
to atlantic city?
Well, thank you,
harvey.
I prefer you, too.
Ha ha ha!
Hi.
Huh? Oh, hi.
What a lovely movie.
Everything ok?
Fine. He's such
a good little boy.
Is he asleep?
Not a sound.
At least not now.
He was in there
talking to somebody,
If you know
what i mean.
Yeah. What do
i owe you?
Uh, $4.00 an hour,
that will be $18.00.
Ok.
Oh, thank you.
You know, when my
daughter was small,
She used to talk to
herself all the time.
Really?
Yeah. I even had to
set an extra place
For somebody
named trinket.
Hell, they were
real close.
Good night.
Albert?
Albert?
Come on,
what are you doing?
Come on, albert,
where are you?
Albert!
Albert?
Damn!
Albert! A bad idea.
It's still a bad idea!
Ah, voila.
Merci!
Hi, gomez.
It's me, albert.
Hi!
It's me...Albert.
Albert! But what
are you doing here?
Mon petit chou.
Mon petit chou.
What are you
doing here?
It will not work.
They will send you back.
No, they won't.
They love me.
Of course
we love you.
But how did
you get here?
On the bus.
On the bus?
Who'd you come with?
Where's
your godmother?
Where is harriet?
Where?
I ran away.
I'm never going back.
I want to stay
with you.
I can't believe you have done this,
albert.
You are crazy!
I can do
the egg trick.
I can do
the double disappear.
C'est ridicule.
II doit retourner
chez sa tante,
Et le plus
tot sera le mieux.
Ne sois pas bete,
antoine.
J'essaie de lui dire que
c'est une mauvaise idee.
You can cut me in half
if you want to...
And i can learn more.
I can do the egg trick.
Anything you want me to do.
Quiet down, albert.
You rest now, ok?
Doucement,
doucement.
I take off
your shoes, ok?
Now rest.
Rest.
And later,
we will take you for hot cakes, ok?
But we have to call
your godmother.
I want to stay
with you.
You cannot stay with us.
Is impossible.
But we love you
very, very much.
Mm-Hmm,
but is impossible.
Now sleep.
Sleep.
Oh, magic...sleep.
Now, you sleep.
Sleep.
No more troubles.
Just peaceful sleep.
Hush.
Sleep. Hush, hush.
Hush.
Fermez les yeux.
Close your eyes.
Shh. Hush.
Sleep.
Hush.
Bogus?
Bogus?
I'm here.
I'm not going back.
Shh.
Yes, you will.
You have
to be strong.
She comes for you.
I want my mom.
I know.
I want to find her.
I want to go
to your world.
But I'm not real.
I am imagination.
I am...bogus.
I don't care.
I don't want to be here.
Take me to where
you come from.
It's not a real place.
It's dangerous.
You get lost...
and never come back.
I'm going,
and you can't stop me!
Albert!
Albert, come back!
Albert!
Albert, albert!
Come back!
Ladies and gentlemen,
Please welcome
the one, the only...
The great albertini!
Watch, because i am about
to confound you.
Mom?
Mom!
Mom!
Mom!
Come back!
He's been here since we came off the stage.
He's anyway totally exhausted.
Of course he's exhausted.
Who the hell sells a bus ticket
to a little boy?
Aren't people
paying attention out there?
Shh. Don't wake him.
Watch him twitch... I think he dreams.
There's something
strange.
How come a little
boy like that
Can run away in the
middle of the night?
He's homesick.
I still don't
understand.
You don't have
to understand
Because I'm his godmother.
I'm taking him home.
Whether you
want to or not.
I don't recall getting
any phone calls.
You guys never even checked
to see where the hell he was.
What about the...
Ok, little guy.
Up we go.
All right.
Ok.
We're home.
Now we'll get into bed.
It'll be great.
Oh, albert, i know we
got off to a rough start,
But you're just going
to have to understand
This is where you live now.
This is your home.
You know?
But, it's probably too late
to be talking about this.
We can talk about it
over breakfast in the morning.
You know, i'll make you
some french toast from scratch
'Cause i know
you like french stuff.
And maybe...Maybe i can find
some real syrup...
You know, the kind they have
from real trees.
I'm sure they must
have some somewhere.
You feel
a little bit cold.
Maybe i should make you
some soup, huh?
He doesn't need soup.
Yeah, i'll make you
a little bit of soup.
You know,
your mom loved soup.
There you go.
And you? You're supposed
to be his best friend.
Where were you?
Why would you let him
go to atlantic city like that?
You're ok? Good.
You know, bogus, you ought
to start doing your job.
I do my job?
Do your job.
You don't do it well enough
as far as I'm concerned,
Because i do my job.
I do the best
that i can.
What more can i do?
I got albertitis.
I'm talking to myself.
No. You are talking
to bogus.
I'm talking to bogus?
Bogus is an imaginary character
on some little boy's wall.
You're not real.
No. It's time
to see me, harriet.
See you?
I don't see anything.
Where are you?
I'm here.
Where?
Here, harriet.
Just behind you.
Don't be afraid.
Try.
I'm here.
Believe, harriet,
and you will see.
I'm waiting.
Aah!
Don't be afraid!
Stop, harriet.
Don't be afraid.
There's a big white
man in my kitchen!
Get out of here!
Get away from me!
No, no, no!
Harriet!
I'm a part of you,
harriet.
No. Go away.
You are such
a difficult woman.
I said, go away.
How can i go away?
Like this.
Oh!
Oh, you want
to play dirty?
Ow! Stop that!
That hurt.
What's the matter with you?
I said i didn't
want to play.
You have to play.
I don't have
to play with you!
This is all your fault,
you know that?
If not for you,
this little boy would be fine.
It's better I'm here.
You need me, harriet.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I need a big
imaginary frenchman
Who comes in and
messes up my life?
No. This is nuts.
No, it's not nuts.
Is imagination.
Where is your imagination,
harriet?
My imagination is fine.
I see you, don't i?
Oh, there is
more to see.
Oh, really?
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
All right, so i should play with this
Because really
what you are
Is some little acorn
in my stomach
That i ate from
some damn doughnut.
Sort of, yes.
And there's 3 of you?
Is there a past,
present, and future?
Yes.
Oh, i see. Ok.
So at the end,
you're going to show me
How good a person
i can be,
And in the beginning,
you're going to show me
What a sad little girl
i was, aren't you?
You're going
to take me back
And show me the little harriet
who used to sit around
And wait for people
to come and play with her
And wait for mail from her mother,
and nobody ever wrote.
You going to sit around,
you going to explain that to me?
I understand.
I've been waiting
for that.
Really?
Yeah.
Where were you?
Where were you
when i needed you?
When i was little?
I was there.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Right.
This little boy
doesn't even like me.
Oh, yeah?
No.
He would like
the harriet i see.
The true harriet.
La vraie.
The one
who is gentle.
Not afraid to play.
Not afraid to love.
Not afraid to trust.
The real harriet
would dance...
With a clumsy frenchman...
if he asked her?
It's time
to bring albert back.
Tell him you see me.
Albert?
Hey, albert?
I saw him.
Albert?
Albert!
Albert!
God.
Albert.
I'm coming, boy.
Albert?
Albert.
Albert?
Come on,
take my hand.
Come on.
Albert?
Go to harriet.
Come on, albert.
I'm right here.
Ugh!
Albert!
You can do it.
Go on.
That's right.
That's it.
Go on, albert.
Take her hand. Reach.
Come on.
Take her hand.
You can do it.
Take my hand.
Come on.
You can do it, albert.
Come on, one more step.
Come on.
Don't be scared.
Come on. Yeah.
All right, i got you.
Come on, give me
your other hand.
Oh, all right.
Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, god.
Oh, my god.
Oh.
Oh.
Listen,
the next time you decide to run away,
Do it on
the ground, ok?
I don't want
to run away.
Good.
'Cause i don't
want you to.
Tell him
you want him here.
I want you here.
I need you.
I really need you.
Tell her
you need her, too.
I need you, too.
Good.
'Cause i want to try to
make us into a family, ok?
Tell her
you want that, too.
Me, too.
I'll try to be
a good mother.
That's pushing it.
I'll try.
You hungry?
Uh-Huh.
Good.
And now the soup.
Come on.
You know,
your mom did this to me once.
My mom ran away?
Yeah. She used
to run away all the time.
Really?
Come on, albert.
Let's go.
What are you doing?
You can't run
through a graveyard.
Stop, boy, stop!
Pow!
Got you.
I tried to be nice, albert,
but you wouldn't listen.
Got you.
Oh. I think you got me
through the heart.
That was
a good one, harriet!
Albert, slow down!
Come on, harriet!
Au revoir.
Well, it's funny.
When they need us,
we are there.
Big "hello,"
big "let's be friends
That never parts
forever and forever."
But when it's done...
poof! We disappear.
They never say good-Bye.
They never see us go.
Oh, sometimes
they remember us...later.
Maybe not.
But...i cannot complain.
It's my job, you know.
Whoo!
Oh, by the way...
If you need me,
i am available, hmm?
