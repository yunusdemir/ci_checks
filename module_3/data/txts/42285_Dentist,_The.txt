-BEDSIDE DENTIST-
Go ahead and rinse ...!
Welcome.
Thank you.
Professor Henningsen.
I did not hear your name.
Henningsen, dentistry school.
Mrs Swan-Hansen, Medirosaco.
I have been looking forward to meeting you.
My card, Johansen!
We are now only waiting for the minister.
He is involved with affairs of state.
Welcome, the Minister
for Education and Science!
Your invitation?
I want to see your name.
Perhaps in your inner pocket?
It is Hans-Jorgen's suit.
Maybe you are in the wrong place?
My name is Thomas Christian Hansen.
If you will show me to my aunt ...
You do not know Mrs Swan-Hansen?
She was present at my baptism!
"I will present you."
Rubber bands.
Rubber bands? Excuse me.
Thomas Christian Hansen.
Oh, so that's how you look?
My card, Johansen.
You are my only real relative
after your parents died.
We will talk more another day.
My nephew.
A quarter Nephew. Son of your cousin.
Blood ties ...!
Family lineage has no decimal places.
We also have other plans.
The Swan-Hansen Fund.
Good evening, Professor Henningsen.
Are you ready for today?
No, but Mrs Swan-Hansen is
my aunt. Her cousin was married ...
Do you have toothache?
Upper number six. It is worn out.
Perhaps you can have a tablet.
No, it must be removed.
I have a strange feeling that I
met Mrs Swan-Hansen in the past ...
Perhaps I could borrow some pincers.
Or a nutcracker.
You talked about the nutcrackers.
Expedition to Sockertoppen 1961.
Will the roast be sent around again?
The minister will have a full stomach.
I usually make speeches
when the food goes around a second time.
Anounce that you want to say a few words.
It will be totally improvised.
Are you alone?
My husband is sitting further down.
But he does not see us here.
You could do me a favour if you discreetly
give the Medical Board of California ...
... a little hint, so we may
get the new mouth wash approved.
XB 300. The new mouth wash.
Were you aware of it?
My husband is one of the inventors.
I am one of the guinea pigs.
We have tested XB 300 for 3 months.
It is said that Dentists will be redundant ...
... when it comes out.
I am crazy about dental practitioners!
Professor, do you know my nephew? He is
a student in your dental school.
Thomas Hansen?
He is sitting over there.
How is he?
Very hard working.
Your husband has examined the XB 300?
It may have side effects.
It would not be very good
if people lose their teeth ...
... or if men become impotent.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I want to thank
Mrs Swan-Hansen who have assembled -
the top Danish scientist,
especially in dentistry.
We are aware of the enterprise
Medirosaco and the future
will bring major changes.
Their pharmacologically news
has played a significant role
in directing the efforts of those -
working with health services
in this country.
Okay, Thomas. See you soon.
Mikael, is nothing sacred to you?
Should he sit and indulge himself -
when I have a job for 300 crowns?
300 Danish kroner tax-free!
The Education sector is also
satisfactory, despite certain phenomena.
We can trust our youth.
The Danish youth
are good ...
... basically ...!
What is the job worth?
-300. You will be home before midnight.
Modelling job. Perfect for you.
I am wearing Hans-Jorgen's suit.
You can change it before we begin.
I have nothing else with me!
Thomas is a true buck.
Always ready for sex.
I like you wearing that suit.
Are you a waiter?
What is this?
Cheers!
Start the music, Britta.
Help me with the zipper.
Mikael ...!
It's full of people here!
Pretend you do not see them.
They're staring at us!
This's what they pay for.
Stop talking and get to it!
It must stand up first!
Girls, help me
get those two out!
I am sorry, but the show will
continue shortly.
ldiot, do not come here again! You ought to
get it cut off with a rusty knife!
There will be only a short break.
Britta, the money ...!
Piss off, or else
I will call Anton ...!
I have lost my modeling fee.
And I lost Hans-Jorgen's trousers!
What should I say to him?!
You can say whatever you want!
Taxi!
"We want to student dorms.
My car is not a live show ...!
We are in trouble! Maybe the next ...!
Would you be so kind and ...
My name is Benedikte.
But you can call me Ditter.
You are called Etkideneb backwards?
Are you coming home to play?
We can play mother, father, children!
I stand here with the child and you
come home. Then you kiss me.
Show me your butt, and I will show you mine.
Please don't tell anyone?
I never tattle.
You should be ashamed!
Thank you for this evening. I will do
my best with the Committee for you.
Benedikte backwards? Etkideneb.
Thank you for this evening, Mrs Swan-Hansen.
Trip of love
is not something we are born with
When poor Thomas
goes and longs for Lisbet
Nina just dreamed of him
And none of them know
Who will win at home.
Real love is
a question of give and take.
So give yourself
and you can be lucky
in love
Nina, have you got a package again?
Mamma thinks I will die of starvation.
French bread homemade!
It is good for the teeth.
My mother wonders if she should send
underwear to me.
A whole liver ...!
Not again!
Mikael loves your mother's liver.
My sister is expecting a child!
They already have a girl
and now they want a boy.
I wish it was me ...!
What do you think?
I will tell it to Mikael.
about the liver, that is ...!
Home baked?
Go ahead, Hans-Jørgen.
Mikael, are you up?
What are you doing?
Nina has received a package again.
With liver.
With thyme and shallots?
It looks good.
Do you think he saw us yesterday?
The Principal? Yes.
Have you slept well?
I'm in a hurry.
I'll just have to find my panties.
"When they were seen in lstedgade
they lacked not only pants ..."
"... but also underwear."
I will take care of it. Thank you.
Put them up on the black list.
Violations of discipline and morality ...!
What are my apointments this morning?
You are to go to the dentist.
They deserver to be caned!
ln the future, you will be gentlemen
on display, fully dressed!
Leave me out of it the next time!
Look at that woman ...!
Do you know her?
My Aunt. I do not want to see her,
because I have not thanked her for yesterday.
I have never been around
so much money before!
Hello, Andreas.
Backwards?
Saerdna. I'm not old and decrepid.
Ditter, you have forgiven me?
Because I did not get to
see your butt ...!
A typical paradontitis apicalis.
It requires a root canal.
What is it? Will it hurt?
First, we drill into the tooth ...
... so we can cut out the root nerve.
Women are not dignified.
Only the women you know.
Mikael, do you love her?
Love? You are so terribly romantic.
Have you never heard of FF?
Sweet! I take one every evening.
It is not beer.
Do you know what FF mean?
Pionear histology?
Imagine that I do not know that ...!
I will not let a student operate on me!
Mr Sorensen, came back!
Were the young people half naked?
Only their legs.
One had flowery underwear ...
He is probably not ...?
It would not surprise me.
I wonder if he has what it takes.
Nina, you know what the FF mean?
Yes. Friendly fucking.
In Danish it says SS.
"Sympathy-Sex".
Only you would think of such things.
You are a cynic, a pig ...!
Professor!
Is Thomas Hansen here?
He left with Michael.
To the library, I imagine.
Thank you.
He is not there right now.
Perhaps it is not the wisest ...
-... to talk to him now.
Very suspicious story.
Schultze will create a large fund
so that he can decide for himself.
Perhaps he is right. I do not want to
Thomas do a dis-service.
Help me to find out if he
is the right man to lead Medirosaco.
I know nothing about the chemical industry.
You misunderstand me. I want to know ...
... if he is a decent human being.
My deceased husband favourite expression:
"Does he appreciate beer,
women and horn music?"
Hey, Nina!
Who is it?
Your Indians. Thank you for the loan.
Is the essay done?
Give me my bath-robe, or turn a blind eye.
You do not need to do
both. Now, let's see ...
A candy.
Mom always sends half a kilo.
If only dad knew!
I guess he also is a dentist?
Yes, I am a hereditary predisposed.
Dad want me to
take over his practice.
Don't you want to?
No. Nothing like that.
But school dental care ...!
I will be happy to be a children's dentist.
Passive memory
Conservation is missing.
Do you know what?
We have been working all day.
You do too much work.
I don't have the grades ...
-... in pharmacology and pathology.
It gives you when Lisbet can.
Sorry.
Do you know what you look like now?
A poor set of Hamlet.
"Here are my lips
which are so often kissed."
Half past five.
I have to go and photograph.
I have distracted you.
Close your eyes and think the spring collection!
Is it not difficult
To be in photography?
What does your father think about it?
He is very proud.
He leaves the magazines with my photos
open in the waiting room.
He is absolutely wonderful.
You are lucky.
Thank you for your help.
Relax. Go to the movies or something.
I'm completely broke.
Didn't you and Mikael earn some money?
"We have not received it yet.
I'm getting money today.
I'll take you. Will you come with me?
If you think this will help, okay ...
When will you get home?
I'm at the clinic until eleven.
Thomas Christian Hansen?
He is on the black list -
and he is with in the student council.
Which is worse?
You would become head of the Fund,
and I would be Chairman of the Board.
My time is precious.
What did you say?
100 000 ...? A year?
Yes, it sounds very interesting.
As long as professor Henningsen
and Mrs. Swan-Hansen are together on ...
A porn store?!
Porn?
Goodbye.
Weekend-Sex and some other
with contact ads.
Where have I seen you before?
Aren't you professor Henningsen?
You are Miss ...
lngalis Madsen.
The Professor repaired
my teeth many years ago.
I still have the bridge.
It looks good.
Do you remember if you were breastfed?
Professor, you know about it!
I will never forget your funny story...!
Weekend-Sex ...
Check if the decrease in Danish
dairy products will continue.
I will be busy for a while.
I am having a massage. The back.
If you can get them for under 300,
buy me 20,000 kronor's worth.
Sell B & W shares.
This is not a brothel,
It is a regular massage clinic.
I just want to know if the young
the man is normal, react normally.
Professional scientific survey?
Strictly scientific.
Such a study here would be expensive.
The most important thing is that it will be ...
... a pretty young girl,
and that the man did not notice anything.
Trust us. I suggest Miss
Lisa, who is talking on the phone.
She looks good.
What do you think? Andreas?
Does the customer want a Swedish massage,
or a French massage
He should have everything. Beer, women ...
And horn music.
We usually do not talk like that.
There you are!
Did you want something?
It was just ...
You can borrow the room.
I am going to the library.
I will not need it any more today,
because I will be going to the movies with Nina.
Thomas?
Mikael?
I'm ready.
Button up your pants, then!
Thomas, justice has prevailed!
A scholarship at 1,200 kronor,
right in your pocket!
I thought it was a bill.
Congratulations. What do you do with the money?
They will grow.
l will pay the bills. Then invest.
Nobody is thinking about me.
Room 531. His name is Thomas.
Can you remember that?
Will it take long? He must not
have guests in his rooms after eleven.
You may turn a blind eye for once.
You will have to tell us all ...
... that has happened in the morning.
You waved at her with these?
I can understand why she hit you.
Does it still hurt?
I have a toothache.
It looks good. But that does not signify.
I will fix it.
You usually take a little, right?
A small rinse is better
than a drilled tooth.
It will help right away.
What are you doing?
Spitting out the liquor?
I did not intend that.
Come in!
Mikael, schnapps is on the table.
I'm sorry that I am interrupting.
The door shut with me outside
and the key is inside.
But here, the lights were turned on.
It was boring.
Can I put the bag here?
Neat place. Are the beds comfortable?
Sit.
Oh, the key is sitting on the inside?
Do you want a dram?
"I never drink during working hours."
Well, perhaps a small one.
Nina, these ...
No they are not mine.
It is not me or Thomas.
Try them on the girl -
whom he slept with this afternoon.
Did you see him clearly?
I am going to be a dentist soon ...
I am not afraid of you. Look!
Open your mouth ...!
You have really beautiful teeth.
You have fun in these rooms, right?
An usher can show you the way.
I do not know him.
You can sleep here, if you wish.
I promise to be quiet.
There's no need to.
You are sweet.
I need to pee.
Can't you wait?
Thomas?
Excuse me for this afternoon ...
At 11 pm. I thought it was you.
Who is she?
Who is she?
She has come to the wrong room.
Contraception? Marianne is not
on the pill because her husband is jealous.
Thomas ...! Two girls?
Things are moving up for you.
Keep in mind one thing tights.
We start production for the scholarship.
Really tight tights.
Art on the buttocks!
We are discovered! Otto came back
and he is furious!
Is it you who will not leave
married women alone?!
Good evening.
Stop! This is my place.
Where did the cowardly pig go?
One more step and I jump!
I freeze in hell and you threaten the
innocent! You are sick with jealousy!
I am sick - I have a fever!
Poor excuse.
lnfluensa!
This will be cost you dearly!
Marianne, I promise to be kind.
Take my jacket.
You can not constrain yourself!
Sorry that I disturbed you.
At last, alone!
Yes. Quite alone.
He will inheret everything from his aunt?
He does not know anything about it.
Keep quiet about it, otherwise it
it ruins everything. He is my friend.
Has there been a burglary here?
I have had some guests.
Mrs Swan-Hansen wants to know if
her nephew have some ...
-... human qualifications.
Thomas is a good man.
You know him.
Thomas and I are close friends.
lntimate? It is just that, yes.
The moral qualifications ...
In other words, women. It is most important
nowadays, within the industry.
I know Thomas. There are things
people will sacrifice a few million.
Not a word about our talk.
It can be misunderstood. A large fortune.
Nothing of the true situation with him?
With Thomas? Nothing at all.
No, money does not mean everything.
Money?
Millions. He has an aunt who is a little
daft. But if he hits on the ladies ...
... it puts the lid on it.
He doesn't get her inheritance?
You are his favorite heartache.
I can count on you?
If you become curious again,
you have me.
Speaking of Thomas ...
I do not want to talk about him.
Nothing romantic. This is seriously.
Even worse ...!
I know how children made.
Good. Open your mouth.
Hold on now ...!
A rich heir is exciting.
Keep you belt on, otherwise there will be no
rich heir. Patients waiting!
Madam Fredrikson is loyal customer here.
Be careful with her.
If you are uncertain about something, ask her.
She knows everything.
No, it should be cleaned more ...!
How are you doing? Can I help?
Thank you. I am getting a toothache again.
It isn't exactly clear.
It should be cleaned more ...!
Do you know who should do the patterns?
To the tights. Jørn Ask!
He exhibit his works. He's back
from France. But he is expensive.
Can you loan me me 200?
I'm broke. The scholarship, then?
We need to get the raw materials.
You can take out a loan?
Can you be a guarantor?
I do not have a penny.
Join us in the business.
We can become partners!
I have no money.
You don't have any hidden assets?
Be careful, it can be costly. Skip
women, otherwise we are ready!
Not today. Add a little
zinc oxide. We'll see you tomorrow.
Tooth ache?
lnflammation at root.
Is it 4 upper? Wait a bit.
Sit down ...!
It doesn't look good.
Open your mouth wide!
No. ...!
Thank you, Johansen.
I was hanging there and saw nothing more.
How many girls in the Room ...
Why did he do nothing?
Perhaps it was too crowded.
It cost me 500 dollars.
That is a lot of money, Andreas.
Is that him?
Yes, an emergency. Use nitrous oxide.
Why not an injection?
It needs to be directly into the nerve.
Close.
He must be kept calm.
Tell me before we put in
the anaesthetic.
No, it is too soon! The book
says that the patient will relax ...
-... and stop being afraid.
It will only hurt a little. Open your mouth!
Poor old Thomas. If I help
him out financially perhaps he ...
No, not erotic musik and the other.
Lawyer Schultze.
Can you something about scholarships?
To a poor student.
It is out of the question. There is no
no legal support for that.
There must be a way.
Be careful about what you say!
No, my paper!
You misunderstood what happened yesterday.
You're welcome to play Casanova -
and look ridiculous to everyone.
Nina ...
I want you so much.
I dream about you at night.
You cannot imagine those dreams
of you ...! You are so wonderful.
Come and marry me?
Leave of!
lie down
and keep your hands off me!
With the ring and everything ...!
Say yes, and we'll do it right away!
Lie down and open your mouth.
What the fuck do you think, nasty witch!
Don't you know what nitrous oxide is?!
Aren't you aware that the patient may
become aggressive if they overdose?
What are you doing?
Nothing. He had too much.
You should be careful.
How do you feel?
Fearful ... wonderful!
A lawyer wants to talk to you.
To me ...?
Royal Brewmaster N.F.S. Hansens
memorial scholarship of 1871.
I have not heard of it.
You do not put in an application to it.
Does it pay a lot?
Yes, 5,000 kronor.
Thank you very much.
Sign here, thank you.
You cannot apreciate how happy this makes me.
It was not my idea.
What will the money be used for?
I will invest it.
In what?
Tights.
Stand up.
Brilliant, Jørn. If the colours
are as good in reproduction, it will be great.
Excellent, Mr Ash.
Get more beer, and shut up!
Shit. Shabby and reactionary Shit!
Take off your pants.
I have nothing underneath.
It can be washed off.
I can help you with that.
I want to paint a naked butt!
Off with them, while I stand here and freeze.
For my sake?
Mr Thomas Hansen, sir.
Am I interupting?
My partner.
I am the one with the money.
Jean, beer ...!
Five thousand.
Congratulations's partner.
I have a name for the collection:
Athomics. Thomas and Mikael.
That tickles ...!
Stand still. The color runs.
A great model with a
good photographer - like Nina.
We will have a rose right there!
The symbol of female womanhood.
Go and shave.
I will do a lot, but not everything!
Is it really necessary?
Have you seen a rose with a beard?
A big airplane will come,
and land in the middle of the tooth.
Do you have a moment?
No.
This is business. Michael and I
has started production.
We can talk about it tonight?
Maybe we can go to the movies.
I have had bad experiences of cinema.
You should not do it for nothing.
I will go to the movies when I grow up.
It is fun to go to the movies ...
... when you have company.
Professor Henningsen
To talk to the mistress.
The dentist?
Thank you, Johansen.
Are you going to work?
Only for two hours.
Wouldn't you like to talk business?
Yes. Would you like to come with me?
What is the job?
I am a kind of baby-sitter.
There is the baby! It gives power
to the whole town. It may not stop!
Put these on.
Engineer!
He plays cards with his cousins
three times a week. There they are!
If the index falls below this line
I should press the green button.
Should't we talk business?
Queen of hearts. Romance.
Have you shufled the cards properly?
I see a red blond woman.
Jack on the queen, right?
You have a son.
Not that I am aware of.
I see a young man
that you are responsibe for.
Then, I have 800 ...!
Jack is going through something that I
do not understand. And he does not either.
It has to be Thomas.
Thomas?
Press the green button!
The green, never the red!
You have pressed the red!
Engineer! ...
I will wring your neck for you!
Are you color blind or just a plain
Idiot! Who the hell has asked you -
to drag a woman in with you here?!
You cannot not think about other things Out!
The light is back on again.
Will you go study?
I really should.
I have a little schnapps left.
And my mother's liver.
Clean off the table,
and I will join you soon.
Where have you been?
I have been waiting here ... in the dark.
I have forgiven you.
Thank you for the wonderful ring.
Graduation and marriage is
outdated. It does not happen any more.
Women are not so virtuous any more.
Neither are men actually.
There is something called
sympathy ... FF. And we are too young.
You are right, darling.
In the morning ... with me.
Let me take off the ring for a while ...
It is stuck.
Good night, darling.
Hello. Can I present ...
This is supper.
Go ahead.
No, thanks. Your a bit thick.
Good evening.
Are you alone?
Yes, quite alone.
Something went wrong with the lights.
It was the red button.
Now it's fine.
Even in the bathroom. Come to me
if you have a problem, Thomas Hansen.
Good night.
What type of ring is that?
An engagement ring.
We are living in a free country.
It is not a problem.
No, we  really should not.
Especially not against your best friend.
You should keep your fingers away!
You do not understand such feelings.
You must keep silent or else
Thomas will be utterly ruined.
So, I'm not stupid.
You are wonderfully stupid.
But you keep silent, right?
You must not say a word.
I am not like that.
It is just slander.
It does not hurt?
No, almost painless.
A bit of a problem on the fourth upper.
It will be quickly fixed.
Can I observe the procedure?
Yes.
Fill the hole again soon ...!
Did you receive praise?
No. It was the wrong tooth.
They are so close to each other,
that anyone can make a mistake.
Thanks for the roses.
She is sweet. Your girlfriend?
No, only Nina.
She helps me sometimes.
She is very clever.
Don't do that! His aunt in in the chair.
He could be a disinherited!
He is secretly engaged.
You're lying!
With whom?
It is a secret. If she finds out -
he may not get a single penny!
A girl kissed Thomas on the cheek.
It does not mean anything.
I should find out
when we seen him next Monday.
I have invited him home.
Is that wise?
I am a mature woman.
Yes, Jack on the queen ...!
He can invite a
girlfriend, if he wants.
No, a little more that way.
We are not finished yet.
Not as long as he is here.
If anyone should know
that he has looked at a woman ...
You will be visiting your aunt.
Do you want to join us?
Continue with the Photos.
Thomas and I need to talk business.
I need the money for new materials.
They are asking for payment.
How much?
850.
There is nothing
compared to a few million.
I will explain it to you.
Don't take either Nina, your fiancée
or someone else with to your aunt.
I should go with a girlfriend.
It's a trap! She wants to test you.
Do as I say,
and you'll be a millionaire within a month!
Mrs Swan-Hansen will be down soon.
Cleaning up?
Is there something wrong?
We had a celebratory drink.
Is this ring waterproof?
Would you like to see it?
To take it off brings bad luck.
It is just superstition.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Good day, Thomas.
Are you alone?
Yes, totally alone.
Welcome.
Come in!
Put it on the coffee table.
Now, let's lets sit down and enjoy a quiet talk.
My late husband. Your uncle,
whom you never met.
He appreciated the good life.
Do you like beer?
It is time for the lecture.
I'll just put on my coat.
Thomas has not come yet.
He is with his aunt.
Has he taken a female friend with him?
No, I put a stop to it.
Otherwise, he would have dragged a girl along.
You said she does not want to know that.
As you said, no women.
Don't tell me you did not understand!
It happens to be the exact opposite!
So intimate.
I probably sholdn't ...
So sweet! A small rose in front of it.
Do you think they will fit me?
I will try them on once.
No. ...!
I have to take my dress.
Wait until you get home!
You need to see me in them.
Help me with the zipper.
It is so tight.
I cannot get it down.
Thomas, you're holding me! It is a
long time since someone held me like this.
My tie is caught ...!
I can't breathe!
Thomas, what is it you want?
Nothing.
I will be late for
my lecture.
Should we cancel the coffee, madam?
Yes, thanks. We are cancelling everything.
Call lawyer Schultze.
Mrs Swan-Hansen wants her nephew
to be interested in beer ...
... women and horn music?
Right. And all that follows.
He is secretly engaged.
Can you prove it?
Today, we discuss the abcess.
First, the acute form:
paradontitis apicalis exacerbans.
Here are the classic
inflammation symptoms:
Tumor, amd redness.
The tooth is extremely sensitive
to pressure and it feels...
Sorry. I stumbled... certainly.
You seem to be ok. Sit down.
Then, the process spreads and
seep into the adjacent tissue.
Help me get the ring
back from Lisbet.
We were mistaken about your aunt.
She is not a puritan -on the contrary.
It was I who found it out.
I gave her my word.
She wants me there tonight.
You have to do it.
What do you think she wants?
To fuss over you a little bit.
It is shocking.
Now?
Just a moment.
A very important call.
Engaged? That explains it.
Come here at eight sharp.
His friend will bring the evidence.
Thank you.
Wretched boy ...!
Unfortunately we must
postpone the signing.
Thomas might come in ...!
I gave my best for a year to you.
Do you think I just want the money?
Your fiancé will be here
at eight, correct?
What are you doing?
Masterbating.
Join us - the party has begun!
Are you going also?
Only for a moment. Don't drink up everything.
Nobody has seen me and it
isn't even eleven yet.
It is hot.
Shouldn't you take off your jacket?
No, I think it is warm enough.
It is creaking.
There is a mat on the floor.
Shouldn't I fix it?
It is not difficult at all!
The call is set up.
From the room, directly to here.
Has she arived?
It will certainly be a hot line.
Why don't you wear your ring?
What if someone else know about it ...!
Your aunt may find out.
She is a little old-fashioned, eh?
All of it - the rings and engagement,
it is all old-fashioned ...
... and out of date.
It should not be so officious.
Sex and the FF ...!
We are modern people.
I am not like that at all.
It is just rumour.
Can you get me the oil can?
We should not be eavesdropping.
How else can we know anything.
Take it off from you,
so, you can get better access.
You will get spots ...!
No, I wont.
Is it pinched?
Yes.
Now we're going to be really comfortable.
I'll just lubricate it a little.
Come now.
Now that helped ...!
It must be greased a little
when it is used so often.
Mikael, who are you talking to?
A personal call.
There is no joy in just lying here.
No, Lisbet not now.
I must study.
I have fallen behind. I have the
paradontol exam the day after tomorrow.
Forget your degree. You will
never perform a tooth filling.
No, never ...!
No, she does not want to.
She sounded completely wild.
I could not get back the ring.
She can sue me -
for a broken engagement
if I do not ...
What was that you heard?
Nothing in particular.
What are you doing with your phone?
An old-trick with matches.
What the fuck is this!
I'm not curious.
But your aunt wanted proof.
My aunt?
Where is she?
With Professor Henningsen.
I did not want to say anything ...
I wonder how much your aunt heard.
You pig!
I just wanted to help.
Thomas, take it easy!
Excuse me.
Can I put on a record?
A little horn music?
Who is it?
Thomas.
Sorry that I am intruding,
but you should not count on me.
I will be going away and will miss
the final exam on Wednesday.
It was all went very well, I heard.
Do not believe everything you hear.
Especially not on the phone.
Think about your future.
I will work out what I may do.
Personally! But not as a dentist.
There is no future in it.
Do not fire the skinner -
until the bear is sold ...
Easy come, easy go ...!
I do not appreciate the care
some people show my private life.
Or why they are possibly interested.
I do not need their help ...
to screw up my life.
I can manage by myself! Good night.
Why did you say nothing?
I tried. Exactly ...
Find him. He is distraught!
What did he come here ...
... at eleven o'clock?
I am going now.
So you will not be forced to violate
all of your stupid rules!
I have always hated dentists.
Now I know why!
You can keep your disgusting ring!
I do not want it ...!
I will put the Indians here. It is not
my fault that you self destruct.
You should do the exam this morning.
If you think someone will be impressed -
that you play the martyr,
then you are completely wrong!
That is the last, unfortunately.
Now, lets enjoy our lunch.
I like to make an attempt now.
Food can wait a little longer.
Is it for me?
Dentist Thomas Hansen.
Congratulations!
It does not like air forced into it.
I will fix it!
We have a lot to discuss, Thomas.
May I call you Thomas?
My name is Thomas.
But I do not have time right now.
You know, there are other isues
than just scholarships ...
What scholarships?
Shall we dance?
Thank you for ... the scolding.
It is filled with nitrous oxide ...!
When do you go home to Aarhus?
I leave tomorrow.
It is nitrous oxide!
Laughing gas in the balloons?
It must be Michael's idea!
He should get a taste of it myself!
I do not want to be with you.
You'll be so aggressive!
We will go into my room and lock
the door, so that nothing happens!
Do you know where Thomas is?
Mrs Swan-Hansen wants to say goodbye.
Already? It's too early.
You can amuse yourselves without my help.
Thomas is safe in his room.
I have never doubted it.
Thomas gets the girl he wants.
Orange.
We will find them soon enough.
I did not want to offend her.
I personally will take care of that.
Would you be able to pay
a small bill?
Do you think only artists want that?
Fortunately, there is state aid!
Tights for everyone!
Nina, everything is a misunderstanding!
She will be sweet again tomorrow.
When she is in Aarhus! Spying ...!
I'm innocent this time.
Your aunt just wanted to say goodbye.
Lisbet shares the bathroom with Nina.
Oh, what are you doing?
Get out!
We'll just borrow the bathroom.
She is having a shower.
can you see?
What are you doing?
Peeping ...!
Get out of here!
Not until you listened to me.
Nina, I love you.
Close your eyes, at least!
What happened is inside of me.
I did not have anything to do with it!
You would have me to play
the main role in the scene!
It was a pity that your Aunt
came in a little too early!
If she had arrived even a bit later
she would had seen what Thomas can do!
Who do you have in your bed?
Nobody at all. No. ...!
We were only trying.
Sigrid ...?!
I missed you.
I thought you were unfaithful.
Where are you going?
Providing information. Keep the bed warm.
I knew nothing and my aunt
just wanted to say goodbye!
Excuse me. They are still arguing,
but now they are in the shower.
Athomic tights.
Go ahead. They are free.
Thank you, Michael.
You are a good friend of Thomas.
I did the exam to himself
to decide if I want to be ...
... the city's worst dentist
or something completely different!
I wanted to say that before you leave.
I'm freezing!
You look funnny with your clothes on ...!
Do I?
The most beautiful place on a girl.
You have changed your mind since that time.
The buns I want to look at are yours, not hers.
Have you considered them enough?
If I get to your tail,
you'll get to see me.
Thomas ... What are you doing?
People can see us.
Only what is over the banister.
Look down there ...!
Do you think they do it
for real at their age?
Sure. Some never stop.
People like us ...!
