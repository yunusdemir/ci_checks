The Boy Next Door (Uncensored version)
I wanna come home, Claire.
Let me come home. Please.
Just get out. Get out!

Don't tell me
Dad's not coming back.
Don't tell me that.
Kevin, wait. Kevin?
Claire, I love you
like a sister,
but you have got to get
those divorce papers signed
and move on.
It's been nine months.
What, are you having
second thoughts?
I'm having dinner.
With Garrett?
Oh, you pussy!
It's for Kevin's birthday.
Honestly, Vicky,
sometimes I think you're
rooting against us.
Who's "us"? You and me,
or you and him?
'Cause I kinda thought
that was done.
He's the father of my kid.
Who cheats with his secretary
every time he goes
to the home office.
Brings a whole new meaning
to "the San Francisco treat."
Not funny.
He said she smelt
like chocolate chip cookies.
- Good-bye.
- I'm just quoting
his e-mail.
You don't have to!
Okay?
Because it's burned
in my mind. Forever.
And for your information,
he doesn't go to
San Francisco anymore.
So stop bringing it up.
It's not fair.
Ta-da! Make a wish.
Happy birthday!
You made that?
Of course!
Come on.
I've been waiting all day.
I want you to see this.
Okay.
I'll help you.
One, two, three!
Three! Ta-da!
Oh, my God, Dad!
Huh?
It's like
a high-powered gaming tower
with, like, an arctic cooler.
And you made this?
Three weekends in a row.
Triple processor.
Oh, Dad,
thank you so much.
Ha-ha.
Let's do cake.
What are you guys doing
for Labor Day?
I don't know. Why?
I thought we'd go camping
like the old days.
Mom too?
Yeah, of course. That's
what I was thinking.
It'll be a lot of fun.
We could catch fish,
and Mom could cook it.
- Yeah, that sounds
like a lot of fun.
- Please?
Look at you.
You got schmutz
everywhere.
Go clean up.
Okay. All right.
Be right back.
Come on, what do you say?
Um... well, when were you
thinking of going?
I get back from a business trip
the Thursday before Labor Day.
Business trip?
Yep.
- Get back Thursday night.
We'll leave... three days.
- Where?
That old cabin we used to
go to at Mammoth Lakes.
That sounds great!
No, I meant where is
your business trip?
Let me guess.
San Francisco?
It's work.
It's not what you think.
- Does she still work there?
- Claire, it doesn't matter.
No, I guess it doesn't matter.
Mom.
Yeah?
So you coming or not?
You know what?
That's the weekend
before school starts.
So, you know,
you guys should just
keep it a guy trip.
You'll have a blast.
Okay.
Okay.
(Crying Quietly)
Kevin!
Honey, we gotta go.
Kevin!
I know.
Mom, the door is jammed.
Mom, look,
can we just forget it?
I don't wanna see
another doctor, okay?
He's not gonna tell you
anything any different.
He is the best allergist
in the Valley, okay?
We're going.
You know what?
- I'll lift the door,
you pull the cord.
- Okay.
Okay, you ready, Mom?
Just pull it up!
It's too heavy.
It's too heavy!
Pull it up, baby.
I got it.
I can fix that for you
if you want.
And you are?
My nephew.
Oh, hey, Mr. Sandborn.
Noah.
I'm staying next door
with my uncle.
Claire.
Here to help me,
uh, when I get the, uh,
bone marrow transport.
Right.
"Transplant,"
Uncle Bob.
"Transplant."
Yeah.
He's got a real knack
for fixing things.
I can, uh, take a look
at this real quick.
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Noah.
Kevin. Yeah.
I don't know what the issue is.
It might be
off the track.
Actually, it's the clutch.
Uh, we can get another one
at the hardware store
if you want.
You wanna go?
Come on.
Well, you know, we actually
had somewhere to be,
but, um, now that
we're gonna be late...
Mom?
- Okay. Go ahead.
- Cool.
- All right.
- It was nice meeting you.
- You too.
- Are you gonna be okay?
Yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Look at me. Yeah.
Love ya.
Love you too.
His parents died last year,
and I'm all he's got now
in the way of family.
Seems like a nice boy.
Yeah, he is.
You up for some coffee?
Yeah, sure, sure.
Come on.
So the entire time,
it was the clutch.
Mm-hmm.
How old are you anyway?
Almost 20.
But you're not
from around here.
No, no. San Bernardino.
My uncle...
Well, actually,
my great uncle...
Uh, he needed help,
I needed change,
so figured I'd go back
to school here.
You mean college?
There was this, uh,
well, accident.
So, I mean, I lost some time.
So I'm gonna finish up
in Monroe High.
That's where I go.
My mom teaches there actually.
She seems way too cool
to be a teacher.
She is cool, for a mom.
Okay.
We got everything.
Good to go?
Yeah, let's go.
Here you go, sir.
Thank you.
Um...
Whoa!
Can you, um...
Can you pay for this?
What? Uh...
Look, that's Allie Callahan,
okay?
She's the most beautiful girl
in the school, and I just can't
think when I'm around her.
So, just can you...
No, no, no.
I hate to tell you this,
but she's already seen ya.
- Just go on and talk to her.
- And say what?
Just tell her,
"Here are some garage parts.
How much?"
Go!
Very funny. Yeah.
- Come on.
- Thank you.
You want me to fail.
Hi.
Hi, Kevin.
Hi, Allie.
I didn't... I didn't know
you worked here.
My dad's making my brother
and me do split shifts
to earn gas money.
Could be worse.
If you didn't have a brother,
you'd be working full time.
- Noah Sandborn.
- Allie. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
Friends with Kevin here.
You know, I'm gonna
go look around.
Okay, sure.
So you're having
a good day?
Yeah.
Great.
How about you?
It's actually...
Check it out.
Ho-ho!
Look who it is!
Whizz!
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jason!
Aw, did you pee-pee?
Oh, what is this, huh?
Come on.
Is this your EpiPen?
Your little penis purse?
You guys, stop it!
Get out of the store!
Come on, the kid
still pisses the bed.
All three of you, get out!
Okay, all right, fine, fine.
See you later, Whizzy.
Stay away from liquids.
Hey, Noah, you ready to go?
Hey, c... How much...
Allie, how much
is this gonna be?
I'll ring it up.
(Register Beeping)
Well, clutch is in.
We're all good.
- You thirsty?
- Yeah.
Thanks for fixing the door
and for including him.
Hey, there was this kid
at the hardware store
giving him a hard time.
Jason Zimmer?
Um, skater kid, red hair,
permanently dumb look
on his face?
That'd be the one.
Kept on calling him
"The Whizz."
He actually had an incident
a couple of years ago
on the playground...
where he got stung by a bee,
and his throat swelled up,
and he panicked
and lost control.
Whizz.
Whizz.
Oh, man.
Kids can be cruel,
especially kids
like Jason Zimmer.
But, please,
don't tell him I told you.
He'd be mortified.
You can trust me.
Anyways, uh, you're all set.
This is very exciting.
Very exciting moment.

It works!
Yeah.
Thank you.
We'll take off this cover
real quick.
Just put it over there.
On the ground?
Wherever. Just set it down.
Doesn't matter.
All right, now,
this bad boy right here
is the alternator.
You know what this does?
No.
It charges the battery.
I'm gonna do one piece of it,
you're gonna do the other.
All right?
All right.
All right?
Yeah, yeah.

You're loosening it up
rather than tightening it.
♪
It's in there, yeah.
You wanna finish it off, Noah?
I'll just do it in there.
Okay.

Okay, I'm changing
the subject.
Um, how long will your uncle
be in the hospital?
Um, don't know.
It's all about
the transplant taking.
Well, until he's better,
you can come over for dinner
here anytime, okay?
I don't want you eating
by yourself. I mean it.
- Thanks, but, you know,
I don't wanna impose.
- Oh, I do.
Especially if she's
making the guacamole.
Okay. You are not
an imposition.
Are you saying I am?
Mmm.
Well, in that case,
I wouldn't mind imposing
on your literature class.
Oh, no, dude.
You don't wanna do that.
- They call her "The Crusher."
- Is that what they call me?
Yes.
You know what?
Carry your own plate.
Clean up all the dishes.
Oh! Now he's really
worried about it.
Oh!
Strange kid.
Why?
Can't put my finger on it.
Don't try so hard.
Okay. He's interested
in literature?
In the classics.
Back in San Bernardino,
we were, uh, studying
<i>The Odyssey.</i>
Want me to help you out
with that?
Yeah, sure.
Here you go.
You know,
I'm teaching Homer
next semester.
- Really? He's my favorite.
- You're kidding, right?
Second that.
Dude, you gotta read <i>The Iliad.</i>
Achilles is this total badass.
Hot-tempered, full of pride,
completely consumed
by his emotions.
- You know what
he called Agamemnon?
- Who?
"A pitiful excuse
for a king."
To his face.
Like, he killed this guy Hector.
Instead of hiding out
like a pussy, he...
Dragged his dead body around
for everybody to see.
Yes!
He stood by his actions,
right or wrong.
Well, because to him,
they were justified.
Do you have any idea
what they're talking about?
No.
Homer's a genius, my man.
Just like Shakespeare,
Byron, Zeppelin, Dylan.
Oh. Poets.
Poets.
Poets.
Poets.


I'll have him back
Sunday afternoon!
Bye, Mom!
I love you!

Oh, hey, Noah.
Come on in.
You know, Kevin already left.
Actually, I, uh,
picked something up for you.

Oh, my God. This is a...
This is a first edition?
I can't accept this.
This must have
cost a fortune.
It was a buck at a garage sale.
One man's trash.
I can't.
I... Noah, I can't.
Honestly, this...
I appreciate it...
Please.
I've been eating here
every single night.
It would mean a lot to me.
Thank you.
- Those yours?
- Oh, no.
They were a gift
from Vicky.
Good.
Why?
Those kind of shoes
are for women trying
to be sexy.
You don't need to try.
I'm sorry.
I-I shouldn't have, uh...
No. No, it's...
It's okay. I...


Where are you?
Almost there.
Well, hurry up!
Vicky, I can't do this.
I haven't had a date
in 18 years. I don't even
know what to do anymore.
Three things...
One, laugh a lot.
Two, take off your wedding ring.
Three, give him head.
What?
Kidding.
Just get here, pronto.
And the closer
I get to this car, the smell is
getting stronger and stronger.
And I walk up
to the guy's window.
Rolls down the window.
I look,
and on the passenger seat
is his dead dog.
You did not tell me that.
So... Ethan tells me
you teach.
English, is it?
The classics.
- Wow.
- What does that mean?
Oh, no. He just means it
as a compliment.
Like, "Wow, you teach
the classics."
That right, Benny?
It's fancy.
I mean, I don't know how many
kids nowadays are gonna use
what they learn from <i>classics.</i>
No offense.
None taken.
I am a vice principal,
and I just wanna see
these kids employed.
- Shall we order?
- Silly me, I just
want them educated.
I'm fine with education,
but we gotta get 'em working.
Practical skills.
That's where the money is.
Ah, money.
That's the goal then.
- Ethan, how's your mom?
- Ah, gallstones.
Oh, gallstones.
Are those the ones
you pass?
Or are those
the other stones?
Yeah, she's getting better.
You know, money's fine,
except when it's motivated
by greed.
You're a little firecracker
when you get riled up,
aren't you?
- Think it stopped raining.
- Firecracker?
Is that how you regard
women with an opinion?
Only when they
disagree with mine.
Pleasure to meet you, Benny.
No, Claire.
Stay, stay!
Where's...
J.K. Rowling.
- I'm sorry?
- Billionaire.
Classics major.
She's a lot of laughs.
She's got a...
You gotta get to know her.

Phone Ringing, Vibrating
Hello?
Question.
I tried to defrost a chicken
in the microwave.
And some of it's kind of cooked,
some of it's kind of not.
You think it's still cool
to eat the cooked part?
No! No, do not eat that.
Then please, come over
and bail me out.
<i>Um, uh...</i>
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Perfect.</i>
Okay.
Yes.
See you soon.
No... Okay. Bye.
I mean, that date was awful.
Like that chicken.
Sorry I couldn't
salvage it more, but...
You did fine.
The damage was done.
Yeah. I'm glad
I had you next door.
What?
God, you're beautiful.
You know that?
Oh, no, I'm...
Amazing.
And sweet,
natural and sexy.
Noah.
So sexy.
Noah.
Kiss me, Claire.
Just...
I can't.
Just once. Please.
I, uh... I have to go.
Tonight, in the window,
you were watching me.
I can't do this.
Noah.
I wanna watch you now.
This can't happen.
We can't...
It's wrong.
It doesn't feel wrong, does it?
Wait.
Oh, my God. Stop.
It feels so... nice.
Soft.
Oh, please.
Please stop.
Oh.
Noah, please!
Stop.
No judgments.
No rules.
Just us.
My God.
A woman like you
should be cherished,
loved.
Let me love you, Claire.

You're perfect in every way.



(Whispers)
Oh, my God.
Hey.
Where you going?
Home.
I gotta get home.
No, you don't.
Kevin doesn't
get home till later.
Have some coffee.
I can't. This...
Was incredible.
Oh, man.
Hey, if you're having
second thoughts,
it's-it's normal.
This isn't normal, okay?
Nothing about this is normal.
Where's my coat?
Would you just stop
for one minute?
Look, Noah, I don't want you
to think that any of this
was your fault, okay?
I'm the adult. I'm the one
that should have kn...
Stop, stop!
Just stop.
What we did wasn't wrong.
No matter what you say,
it wasn't wrong.
I wasn't thinking clearly, okay?
I got swept up
in the moment.
I was vulnerable.
And you are very...
you are very sweet.
No.
And it was flattering,
but I...
No.
It was more than that.
Goddamn it!
Noah, look.
It wasn't more than that, okay?
I was feeling vulnerable and...
How can you say that?
Last night was so perfect.
Because it's true.
And in time,
you're gonna see it too.
Just leave.
Are you okay?
Go!

Mom, we caught seven trout.
Wow!
Yeah, he was,
uh, pretty amazing.
Um, Mom, can Dad
stay for dinner?
Um...
Please?
Dad?
Please?
Sure.
I saw this video on YouTube
with this just, like, big,
you know, mountain dude...
who lives all alone
in this old shack in Montana.
And he cooks all his food
on a shovel.
No, you didn't.
We did.
I mean, we wrap it up
in tinfoil first, but...
And eat off the shovel?
Yeah, well,
a foil-covered shovel.
- It was a great meal.
- It was delicious.
- Yeah, it was like one of
the best meals I ever had.
- Oh! Thank you.
No, wha... No offense, Mom.
I don't... I don't mean...
You know what I mean.
I don't mean it like that.
This was great.
What do you think
she made?
I bet you it's cookies.

I'll get it.
You want any coffee?
Yeah, I'll have some,
if you are.
Noah! What's up?
Hey, man, you're back.
- How was the trip?
- Hey, Dad, this is, uh...
this is Noah.
Remember, I've been
talking about him a lot?
Hey, nice to meet you.
I feel like I know you.
He talks about you so much.
- Told me about the alternator
you put in the truck.
- Want to sit down?
 Oh, actually,
Kevin helped out too, so, uh...
Yeah?
Yeah, I did.
Yeah, it was so cool.
I had no idea
you could do that yourself.
- That's what friends are for.
- Hey, Mrs. Peterson.
- Hey, Noah.
- Wow, looks perfect.
You tell them
what happened this weekend?
What happened?
Well, there wa...
There was a big
thunderstorm up here.
You guys didn't get it up there?
No. Beautiful.
Dry as a bone at the lake.
Well, it got
pretty wet here.
Wow.
You know what?
Big day tomorrow.
First day of school.
It's getting
kind of late.
It's, like, 8:30.
Oh, no, no, no.
Actually, I gotta get going.
It's a big day tomorrow.
I'll walk out with you,
Mr. Peterson.
Oh, I'm-I'm gonna
stay around a while, thanks.
Well, then I'll walk out
with you, Noah.
Yeah, come on.
Uh, do you want to take
a cookie for the road?
Oh! I love
your mother's cookies.
- They're great, right?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Hey, you too, pal.
Nice kid.
You know, we need to figure out
what we're doing here, Garrett.
What do you mean?
I mean, we're in limbo here,
and maybe, you know,
it's just time to move on.
I'm not seeing her anymore.
But you might as well be,
because I'm always gonna
think you are,
and I don't wanna live that way.
And you shouldn't wanna
live that way either.
Hey, it wasn't about her.
It was about us.
Okay?
Uh, we were broken.
We both checked out.
I'm not saying
what I did was right.
It wasn't.
It was... It was stupid.
Smart people
do dumb things.
They make mistakes.
Haven't you ever made a mistake?
Don't throw our marriage away
'cause I made a mistake.
Don't file. Not yet.
Just take...
Take some time.
All right.
Come on.
♪ Don't shake when you
<i>see me comin' your way ♪</i>

Welcome, everybody, to the start
of a brand-new year.
This year, we are studying
Homer's <i>Iliad</i> and its themes.
The first one we'll be studying
is the wrath of Achilles.
- Mrs. Peterson.
- Principal Warren,
what a nice surprise.
Good news. I've approved
your request for Noah Sandborn
to join your class.
"No man or woman born,
coward or brave,
can shun his destiny."

I think it was Achilles
who said that, right?
Wait.
Ed? Wait.
Wait a second.
This is a class for AP juniors.
Noah Sandborn
is a transfer senior, so...
I'm confused.
Your transfer request said...
Yeah, that he'd be
an asset to the class.
This was your e-mail.
That's right.
Thank you.
Have a great year.

- Kevin!
- Yeah?
Did you send an e-mail
from my account
to Principal Warren?
No. Why?
Because somebody did.
Sounds like you've been hacked.
You should really change
your password.
- I'd be happy to help you out
with that if you want.
- No, thanks.
Hey, you ready to go?
Yeah.
Kevin?
Noah, can you give us
a second, please?
You can wait for him outside.
Yeah, I'll be down
in a minute.
Sure, yeah.
Mom, that was really rude.
Why'd you do that?
He's here way too much.
You're the one who told him
he could be, and he's coming
to dinner tonight.
No. Your dad's coming
to dinner tonight.
- So why can't he come too?
- I want it to just be
the three of us, okay?
Okay, yeah.
Okay.
All right.
I'll see you later then.
My Uncle Bob was
a tail gunner in Korea...
and a sergeant in Vietnam.
Tough old dude.
Now he's laying
in Valley Memorial,
hopin' the transplant takes.
Here, you got that?
Thanks.
Your dad seems to be
around a lot now, huh?
Yeah, I guess.
Like dinner and a camping trip
can just make you forget about
how he walked out on you.
Uh...
You know, it's so predictable.
A guy hits middle age
and suddenly staring death
in the face.
You know,
tire around the waist,
hair in the drain,
cock that just won't
stand up anymore.
He wants to feel alive again.
He wants to feel that rush,
you know, he felt
when he was our age.
So, he picks up
a younger woman...
Poof!
Whole new life.
Go ahead and aim.
Almost.
Little better, right?
Yeah. Here, switch
with me real quick.
Then the guilt sets in.
'Cause he basically
just left the first kid
in the dust.
So he tries to bribe him
with things.
Like computers.
Wow.
You follow me?
So, what's up?
How's school?
It is what it is.
Tell him about
your computer class.
He's learning how to write
his own software.
- Like father, like son.
- Oh, that's cool.
We can... We can do
some stuff together.
- I dropped it.
- What?
I dropped it.
It was boring.
Going out for boxing now.
You're going out for box...
You don't like boxing.
How would you know?
How would you know?
Seriously, how would
you know what I like
and what I don't like?
- Am I missing
something here?
- Yeah!
Okay, you've been missing it
for nine months, Dad!
You just can't come back in
here and expect to pick up
like nothing happened!
Okay?
Life's been happening.
Kevin, that's enough.
Mom, he's gotta
hear this, okay?
Life's been happening, Dad.
You know what, Mom?
I got-I got homework
to do, so...
Kevin, wait. Wait.
At least finish
your dinner!
Let him go.
He just probably
needs some space.

Oh!
Here we go. Get up.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, how was dinner
with your dad?
Let's just take a break,
all right?
No, keep going.
Come on, talk to me!
Dinner.
I was... It was...
God, I was a jerk, okay?
I feel really bad about it.
Oh! No, no.
Dude, that's good.
It means he knows
you're onto his bullshit.
We just gotta hope
that your mom
doesn't fall for it.
Can't let her, uh,
be his meantime girl.
What's that?
You know, someone he screws
in the meantime.
Hey, uh, come on.
Someone he screws
in the meantime?
Put your body into it.
There we go! Kev!
Take it easy, Kev!
Calm down!
Easy! Easy!
Kev! Hey, hey!
Hey! Kev! Kev!
What do I do?
What do I do?
Goddamn it!
Where's your pen?
Where's your pen?

Shit!
Here, Kev, Kev, Kev!
I got it. Here, I got...
What do I do with it?
Oh, my God!
Where do I put this?
Shove it in the leg!
It's... Is it working?
You good?
Oh, my...
You all right?
Oh, my...
You...
You're... You're not dying
on me today, okay?
God! Get over here.

Garrett's coming on
a little strong,
don't you think?
What makes you think
they're from Garrett?
Oh!
- Did you read my card?
- Would I read your card?
"Please give me
another chance."
What?
It's a thin envelope.
Ugh. Tell me
you're not going to.
I'm thinking about it.
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Oh, I know. I know.
Let's tell him
to take his cookies and
shove 'em right up his ass.
You know what?
Enough with
the cookie jokes.
We've all done things
in our lives that we wish
we wouldn't have.
You know what?
Maybe you should start worrying
about yourself for a change.
It's way more fun
worrying about you.

Make him grovel
just a little bit, I swear.
<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Hey!</i>
Um, so, uh, what...
Did I catch you
at a bad time?
<i>No, never.</i>
<i>They're beautiful,</i>
<i>Garrett.</i>
<i>What is?
The flowers!</i>
<i>Flowers?
What flowers?</i>
<i>Claire?
Hello?</i>
You know what?
I'm gonna call you back.
<i>Clai...</i>

I need to talk to you.
I'm busy with, uh,
physical education.
I believe you're familiar
with that subject, right?
Noah!
Those flowers?
What were you thinking?
They were a peace offering.
Do you know
what that looks like?
A student sending
a teacher flowers?
That's why
I didn't sign the card.
And you hacked my e-mail?
You said I could be
in your class.
And you're trying to turn Kevin
against his father!
You can't blame me
for the trouble your
cheating ex-husband...
has brought upon himself.
Stop it!
And you're welcome,
by the way,
for saving your son.
Thank you.
You know what?
I... You're right.
I should have thanked you.
Everything okay, Claire?
Yes, Mike.
Everything's fine.
Thanks.
Look, I just want us
to start over, Noah, okay?
Can we do that, please?
Uh, yeah.
I can if you can.
So, deal?
You can trust me, Claire.
Okay?
Okay.
Allie. Hey.
Hi, Kev.
Need something?
Yeah. Um, I need four
3/8th hex head bolts,
nuts and washers.
And I need an air filter
for a 2012 Silverado Z71.
And I need you to go
to a movie with me.
I'm-I'm kind of busy
with work.
And now that school's started...
Um, okay.
Um, well, I guess
I'll-I'll see you
around then.
But I... I don't have a date
to Fall Fling.
Um, me neither.
That'd be really great.
Yeah.
Like, really, really, um...
Great?
Yeah, great.
Great.
Well, okay.
Well, um,
I'll see you around.
Okay, cool.
Okay.

Whoo-hoo!
I think I like
the first one better.
You do?
Then the soldier says,
"No, no, buddy.
She didn't have a head."

Oh, God.
It's stupid.
It is stupid.
Mmm.
I'm not ready.
What?
There's someone else?
No.
But when we were apart...
Hey, no, no, no.
Look, it was nothing.
I don't wanna know.
But it just made me realize
how lost I was.
Me too, Claire.
We gotta...
Listen, we-we gotta have
a clean slate.
Okay.
But until I get my head
straight, I'm not ready
to just jump back in,
and I need you to know that.
All right.
All right.
It's honest. Okay?
No guarantees.
I get it. Okay.
I, um...
I think I had one too many.
Can I crash on the couch?
Okay.
Okay.

<i>Perfect...</i>
in every way.




I just want you to know
I'm not giving up on us.
Well, I want you know
that I'm not asking you to.

Kevin! Let's go!

What a fucking whore you are!
"Deal," you said.
"Let's make a deal."
You trying to play me, Claire?
Of course not, Noah.
Bullshit!
What?
Why are you doing this?
Because
you're a fucking liar!
What is wrong with you?
I'm seeing things
clearly now.
You have to stop...
Hey, Noah, what's going on?
Game on.
Mom, what just happened?
Honey, I need you to
stay away from Noah. Okay?
He's a bad influence.
- What are you talking about?
- You're just gonna have to
trust me on this one. Okay?
No! I'm not gonna trust you.
'Cause you're not taking away
the one good friend I have.
He's not your friend.
Bullshit, Mom.
He's my friend!
Excuse me?
Watch your mouth
and get in the car!
- He said you'd do this!
- What?
He said if you did, then
it was Dad talking and not you.
He's been right all along.
This is crazy.
Noah, wait!
Kevin. I'm asking you
to get in the car.

See you at school.

Hello!
Hello! Hello!
Be careful, man!
 Watch it!

You know what I see?
A pathetic old woman

Because all she really is...

You're gone.
You're expelled!

Kevin, you don't want

Come on! You're gonna be late!
Mom, we're gonna

Nobody's even gonna be there.
Okay, how do I look?

Allie Callahan's

Sorry, guys.
Good morning.
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.
Morning.
Um... give me
one second, okay?

Oh, my God.

What's going on?
She locked us out.
Mrs. Peterson!
Mrs. Peterson,
open this door!

Mrs. Peterson!
Open this door now!


Mrs. Peterson,
I'm coming in!
Come on in.
What the devil is going on?
The bell rang five minutes ago.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ed.
Take a seat.
Come on.
Why was your door locked?
Oh, I was just...
I just had a personal call.
You guys, take your seat.
Okay?
All right.
You know what?
Give Mrs. Peterson and I
a second.

I'm concerned, Claire.
Very concerned.
Your behavior lately
has raised
a lot of eyebrows.
Mike Avenido reported
an incident in the gym
with you and Noah Sandborn.
Oh! Yeah, I...
I remember that.
That was when
I was reprimanding him
for skipping class.
Mike said that you got
physical with him, that you
put your hands on him.
You know what our policy is
regarding the use of
physical force on students.
Well, I would hardly say
I was using physical force.
I'm not questioning
your integrity here.
Okay?
But I am questioning
your behavior.
Get it together.
Please.

Hey, Kev!
What?
Told your mom
I'd pick you up today.
'Cause I think
it's time for you
to drive this bad boy.

I'm not used to you driving.
Yeah, well, I've been
doing it a while.
I guess.
Come on, buddy, slow down.
You like to drive fast.
Isn't that right?
I mean, why else
get a car like this?
Unless you're trying to
be something that
you're just completely not.
Kevin, slow down!
Do you have any idea
what that was like
when you were gone?
You didn't see her, Dad.
Okay?
She wasn't Mom anymore.
She was just
completely torn apart.
I had to sit back and watch,
and there was nothing
that I could do about it!
Kevin!
Slow this car down!

- Oh, no!
- Oh, f...
- What's wrong?
What's going on?
- It's not braking!
- Hit the brakes!
- It's not working!
- Downshift!
- It's not working!
- Downshift! Downshift!
- There's no clutch!
- What do you mean,
there's no clutch?
Look out! Look out!
Here comes a car!
Look out! Watch out!
- Oh, fuck!
Okay! All right, here goes.
Straight. Straight.
Here comes another one, Kevin.
Stay right here! Kevin!
Look out! Look out!

- Nothing's working, Dad!
- We gotta get off the road!
Emergency brake.
Punch it! Punch it!
- Oh, shit!
I'm so sorry!
Are you all right?
It's okay.
It's okay, Son.
It's okay.
Kevin!
- Garrett?
- We're in here watching TV.
What happened to your car?
Oh, nothing.
I had a little fender-bender.
We're all right.
Yeah. They look,
uh, fine to me.
Hey, Mrs. Peterson.
We're watching
the, uh, Detroit Grand Prix.
Come on in and get a slice.
Yeah, there's plenty of room.
I gotta unpack the groceries.
I'm gonna go get
something else
to munch on.

Look at these clowns.
Do you have any chips?
You took pictures!
A video actually.
Captured the moment.
Come over tonight,
after they're asleep.
Say, 2:00.
Go fuck yourself.
I'd rather fuck you.
You're fucking crazy.
Who should I show it to first?
Garrett?
Or maybe...
Kevin!
No.
Yeah?
Do you want a soda?
That sounds good.
Thanks.
Hey, I'll take
another cold one, please!
Anything for you, Garrett.

I'll leave the light on.
Noah?
Hey, you're early.
Where's the damn video?
- Why are you so angry?
- What you did
in my classroom today?
You've been avoiding me.
You think this is some kind
of game we're playing here?
This is real life!
That is my home!
You're doing things
in front of my kid,
in front of my husband.
Your...
Your husband?
Your fucking cheating,
lying husband?
Okay.
What's your plan?
What do you think,
we're gonna date?
We're gonna go on
family vacations together?
What do you think
is gonna happen here?
Here? Nothing.
But it's a big world
out there, Claire.
- Oh, my God, this is crazy.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait!
Wait.
Look...
You see that video...
and the proof of our love...
as a threat to this life,
but I see it as a promise...
for a better one.
And none of this will ever
see the light of day.

If...
you let me show you
what's possible.
Because, Claire,
I will never,
ever gonna let you go.
Crazy!

Oh, Claire.
Okay, um,
why didn't you tell me?
I-I just, uh...
I thought that
I could handle it.
I thought that it was
gonna just blow over.
I didn't think he was
gonna turn into a stalker.
Okay, okay, okay.
We can look at this picture,
and we see... we <i>know</i>
<i>that he's a psychopath.</i>
But it's not the way
the rest of the world's
going to see it.
And there's a video.
What?
There's a video,
and if it gets out...
I'm gonna lose
my son, my husband,
my job, my life,
everything that I've...
Claire, listen to me.
That's not going to happen.
Do you know why?
I'm not gonna let that happen,
and neither are you.
No one is going to
see that video.
It won't see the light of day.





What?
Claire, he saw me.
Get the hell outta there.
He's coming back there!
Wait. I haven't
even found the video
or the files yet.
Get the hell out of there!
You got five minutes, max!

Mrs. Peterson!
Mr. Sandborn!
- You scared the living
daylights out of me.
- I'm sorry.
What in the world
are you doing here?
Sorry.
Tell me that you're home and
that all the doors are locked.
Yes.
And I found the computer,
and I deleted all the files.
<i>Good. Good.</i>
But I found
something else
even creepier.
I'm not surprised.
He's a freak!
Does Ethan know any cops
in San Bernardino?
Oh, I'm sure he does.
If we're not having dinner
with his mother,
we're having dinner with cops.
<i>Why?</i>
Just a hunch.
I might have to
go there later.
But I'll call him.
He went to Laughlin with
his mother for her birthday.
Welcome to my world.
- <i>But listen,</i>
<i>I'll call you...</i>
<i>What?
He's here!</i>
Get out of there!
Run!
Claire! Claire!
I'm gonna call the cops!
- <i>Talk to me, Claire!</i>
<i>I'm dying!</i>
He's trying to
force the lock.
<i>What?</i>
Oh, God!
Well, then run! Hide!

Hey, Mom, what's with the knife?
- It's Kevin.
- Oh, my God!
I'm going crazy.
You guys have to spend
the night with me, out here.
Oh, God.
I love you very much.
I'll talk to you later.
Ethan said you wanted
to take a look
at the Sandborn case.
Yes.
Sad.
I remember it.
They were on a back road
outside San Bernardino.
Tire marks indicated the driver
had lost control of the car.


The crash killed
both passengers instantly.
And it was ruled an accident?
Bodies were destroyed,
so there was no toxicology.
But we assume
the driver was drunk.
Why was that?
Well, he had
a long history of DUI's.
Or his brakes went out.
I mean, th-they could have
been tampered with.
Well, Mrs. Peterson,
even if his brakes went out,
there was no indication
of malfeasance.
Sometimes brakes malfunction.
Sometimes, uh, people
drive while intoxicated.
This is the Sandborn car.
If you don't
need anything else...
One more question, Detective.
Um...
was this a 2006 minivan?
Well, yeah.
That's exactly what it is.
Is there something else
I need to know, Mrs. Peterson?
No.
Thank you.



Hey, Noah.
<i>You home?</i>
Yeah, what's up?
<i>You got plans tonight?</i>
Well, I'm supposed
to go to that car show
with my dad.
<i>I'm over here working
on Vicky's tractor.</i>
You're at Vicky's?
<i>Yeah, I'm at her ranch.</i>
<i>You know where it's at?</i>
<i>Yeah, I think I know</i>
<i>where that is.</i>
Is everything all right?
Can you and your dad
swing by and give me a hand?
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, let me ask.
<i>Just get over here.</i>
All right.
Catch you later.
Bye.
Let me just start off
by saying I'm sorry.
No, really, I-I-I am...
very, very sorry,
Vice Principal Lansing.
See, I-I've got a bit
of a temper, you know.
There's no denying that.
And sometimes...
Well, it gets the best of me.
Like when I'm feeling like
I'm being bullied.
And no one likes
to be bullied, Vicky.
Can I call you Vicky?
I mean,
given that I'm in your house
and it's after hours,
calling you "vice principal"
just feels, I don't know...
Wrong.
See, my guess, Vicky,
is that, uh, you don't
like to be bullied.
I mean, who would?
But that's what you
were doing to me today.
You and Claire.
Now, the two of you
and your little secrets...
You were playing a joke.
You know, a silly little game.
Trying to make me think
that you were her so...
she could do... what?
Something sneaky?
Something...
she's hiding from me?
What was it, Vicky?

Oh, no, no, no.
Let me.

Vicky!
Listen, I am pretty sure...
that Noah tampered
with the brakes
on his parents' car,
and that's why they crashed.
And I'm pretty sure
he did the same thing
to Garrett's.
<i>Claire, I need you.</i>
<i>I need to talk.
Can you come over?</i>


Vicky?
Vicky!
Are you upstairs?

Vicky?
Vicky.



Oh, my God!
Oh... Oh...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
911. What's your emergency?
Out.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
No! No!
Noah, you killed Vicky!
For you.
For you, okay?
She wasn't your friend, Claire.
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
When I love somebody,
I protect them.
That's what heroes do.
Do heroes kill
their mother and father?
I would never,
ever hurt my mother.
I loved my mother,
but she killed herself.
My cheating father
and his whore...
got what they deserved.
But hey,
I protect people I love.
This is all for you.
Okay?
No!
Now let's go.
Garrett!
Garrett!
Oh, my God.
What did you do to him?
Well, he ran into
a 14-inch crescent wrench.
Mom!
Kevin!
Noah, you hurt my mom,
I swear to God...
Really, Kevin?
I would never
hurt your mother.
I love your mother.
Just steady
your breathing, baby.
And honestly, I'd hoped
you'd see me as a mentor
who cared about you...
more than
your <i>cheating father...</i>
ever did.
Tell him, Claire.
- Do you need your shot?
Mom...
You know, it's destiny, Claire.
And you can't interfere
with destiny.
Mom, no, no.
We're meant to be.
And Garrett...
needs to know that.
Wake up!
Hey, wake up!

It's gonna be okay.
No, I was gonna
take Kevin with us.
Seems like he's got too much
of his father in him.
- No, he needs to go.
- No! No, no, no.
No, he's not like
his father at all.
Noah,
y-you've taught him.
You've <i>changed</i> him.
All right.
All right then,
uh... he'll come with us.
Yes.
Form our own family.

Mom! Mom!

No! Please, Noah!
Please, just stop this.
Let me help you.
There's still time.
There's no time.
This <i>is</i> our time.
You'll never be lovelier
than you are right now.
We will never be here again.

- What are you doing?
- I'm building a funeral pyre.
What does it look like?

You can't do this!
No!
Stop!

I'm sick and tired of everyone
going back and forth!
- So it's time to make
a choice, my love!
You either live with me,
or you die with them.
No! Stop!




Take Kev and get out of here!

No! Garrett!
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
- Mom!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Stay with me, Garrett!
Garrett, stay with me!
Stay with me.
All right.
Let's go, Claire.
You'll see.
You and me,
off-grid.
There is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

You can trust me.
But, Noah,
you can't trust me.



- Die, you piece
of fucking shit!

Don't! Don't!






Sorry, buddy, but sometimes...
even heroes
have to make tough choices.
Noah! Noah!
Noah!
You're no hero.

I'm here.
I'm right here.

All right, guys,
lift on three.
One, two, three.
Me and Kevin
are right here, sweetie.
All right, move.
We got him now, ma'am.
Don't you worry.
He's gonna be fine.
Just hang in there.
Hang in there.
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.
And then we're gonna go home.
You hear me?
We're going home.
