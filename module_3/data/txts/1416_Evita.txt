It is my sad duty to inform you
that Eva Perón, spiritual leader
of the nation, entered immortality
at 8:25
this evening.
- You are not welcome here.
- He was the father of my children too.
They have a right to see him,
to pay their last respects.
You are not his wife.
Your children are bastards.
No, no! He's my papa!
Oh what a circus
Oh what a show
Argentina has gone to town
Over the death of an actress
Called Eva Perón
We've all gone crazy
Mourning all day and mourning all night
Falling over ourselves to get all
Of the misery right
Oh what an exit
That's how to go
When they're ringing your curtain down
Demand to be buried
Like Eva Perón
It's quite a sunset
And good for the country
ln a roundabout way
We've made the front page of all
The world's papers today
But who is this Santa Evita?
Why all this howling, hysterical sorrow?
What kind of goddess has lived among us?
How will we ever get by without her?
She had her moments
She had some style
The best show in town was the crowd
Outside the Casa Rosada
Crying, "Eva Perón"
But that's all gone now
As soon as the smoke
from the funeral clears
We're all gonna see, and how
She did nothing for years
You let down your people, Evita
You were supposed to have been immortal
That's all they wanted
Not much to ask for
But in the end you
Could not deliver
Sing, you fools, but you got it wrong
Enjoy your prayers
because you haven't got long
Your queen is dead
Your king is through
She's not coming back to you
Show business kept us all alive
Since 1 7 October 1 945
But the star has gone
The glamour's worn thin
That's a pretty bad state for a state to be in
Instead of government, we had a stage
Instead of ideas, a prima donna's rage
Instead of help, we were given a crowd
She didn't say much, but she said it loud
Don't cry for me, Argentina
For I am ordinary
Unimportant
And undeserving
Of such attention
Unless we all are
I think we all are
So share my glory
So share my coffin
It's our funeral too
Senor Magaldi?
It's seven o' clock. You'll be late.
Now, Eva Perón
Had every disadvantage
You need if you're going to succeed
No money, no cash
No father, no bright lights
There was nowhere she'd been
At the age of 1 5
As this tango singer found out
Agustin Magaldi
Who has the distinction of being the first
Man to be of use
To Eva Duarte
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays forever more
In the glow of those twinkling lights
We shall love through eternity
On this night in a million nights
Fly away with me
I never dreamed that a kiss
could be as sweet as this
Now I know that it can
I used to wander alone
without a love of my own
I was a desperate man
But all my grief disappeared
And all the sorrow I'd feared
wasn't there any more
On that magical day
When you first came my way, miamor
To think that a man
as famous as you are
Could love a poor little nothing like me
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Just listen to that
They're onto you, Magaldi
I'd get out while you can
It's happened at last
I'm starting to get started
I'm moving out with my man
Now, Eva, don't get carried away
Monotony passed, suburbia departed
Who could ever be fond
of the back of beyond
Don't hear words that I didn't say
What's that?
You desert the girl you love?
The girl I love?
What are you talking about?
She really brightened up
your out of town engagement
She gave you all she had
She wasn't in your contract
You must be quite relieved
That no one's told the papers
So far
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Would I have done
What I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would stay together?
Seems to me there's no point in resisting
She's made up her mind,
you've no choice
Why don't you be the man
who discovered her?
You'll never be remembered for your voice
The city can be paradise
For those who have the cash
The class and the connections
What you need to make a splash
The likes of you get swept up
In the morning with the trash
If you were rich or middle class...
Screw the middle classes
I will never accept them
My father's other family were middle class
And we were kept out of sight
Hidden from view at his funeral
Do all your one night stands
Give you this trouble?
Eva, beware of the city
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled
It is mad
Those who are fools
are swallowed up whole
And those who are not become
What they should not become
Changed, in short they go bad
Bad is good for me
I'm bored, so clean and so ignored
I've only been predictable, respectable
Birds fly out of here
So why, oh why, oh why the hell can't l?
I only want variety of society
I want to be a part of B.A.
Buenos Aires, Big Apple
Five years from now I shall come back
And finally say
You have your way
Come to town
But you'll look at me
with a foreigner's eyes
The magical city
A younger girl's city
A fantasy long since put down
All you've done to me
Was that a young girl's fantasy?
I played your city games all right, didn't l?
I already know what cooks
How the dirty city feels and looks
I tasted it last night, didn't l?
Eva, beware your ambition
It's hungry and cold
Can't be controlled, will run wild
This in a man is danger enough
But you are a woman
Not even a woman
Not very much more than a child
And whatever you say
I'll not steal you away
What's new, Buenos Aires?
I'm new
I want to say I'm just a little stuck on you
You'll be on me too
I get out here, Buenos Aires
Stand back
You oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
Fill me up with your heat
With your noise, with your dirt, overdo me
Let me dance to your beat
Make it loud, let it hurt, run it through me
Don't hold back
You are certain to impress
Tell the driver this is where I'm staying
Get this! Just look at me
Dressed up somewhere to go
We'll put on a show
Take me in at your flood, give me speed
Give me lights, set me humming
Shoot me up with your blood
Wine me up with your nights
Watch me coming
All I want is a whole lot of excess
Tell the singer this is where I'm playing
Stand back, Buenos Aires
Because you oughta know
What you're gonna get in me
Just a little touch of star quality
And
If ever I go to far
It's because of the things you are
Beautiful town
I love you
And
If I need a moment's rest
Give your lover the very best
Real eiderdown
And silence
You're a tramp, you're a treat
You will shine to the death
You are shoddy
But you're flesh, you are meat
You shall have every breath in my body
Put me down for a lifetime of success
Give me credit, I'll find ways of paying
Rio de la Plata
Florida, Corrientes, Nueve de Julio
All I want to know
I don't expect my love affairs
To last for long
Never fool myself
That my dreams will come true
Being used to trouble
I anticipate it
But all the same I hate it
Wouldn't you?
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
- Where am I going to?
- You'll get by, you always have before
Time and time again
I've said that
I don't care
That I'm immune to gloom
That I'm hard through and through
But every time it matters
All my words desert me
So anyone can hurt me
And they do
So what happens now?
Another suitcase in another hall
Take your picture off another wall
You'll get by you always have before
Where am I going to?
Call in three months time
And I'll be fine
I know
Well, maybe not that fine
But I'll survive anyhow
I won't recall the names and places
Of each sad occasion
But that's no consolation
Here and now
Where am I going to?
Don't ask any more
Good night and thank you, whoever
She's in every magazine
Been photographed, seen
She is known
We don't like to rush
but your case has been packed
If she's missed anything
you could give her a ring
But she won't always answer the phone
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But we have pretended enough
It's best that we both
stop fooling ourselves
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been and never will be a lover,
male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
In fact they rely on tricks
they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them
You're the same
Good night and thank you, Emilio
You've completed your task
What more can we ask of you now?
Please sign the book
on the way out the door
And that will be all
lf she needs you, she'll call
But I don't think that's likely somehow
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
But when we were hot
we were hot
I know you'll look back
on the good times we shared
Which means...!
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been
and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame her
You're the same
There is no soap
No soap like Zaz
No detergent, lotion or oil
With such power
In the shower
It's the mother and father
Of luxury lather
The talk of the bath
The great ointment
One little frolic
With new Zaz carbolic
You're scented
You'll be sent
Good night and thank you, Senor Jabón
We are grateful
You found her a spot on the sound radio
We'll think of you
every time she's on the air
We'd love you to stay
but you'd be in the way
So do up your trousers and go
Oh but it's sad when a love affair dies
The decline into silence and doubt
Our passion was just too intense to survive
Which means...!
This is a club I should never have joined
Someone has made us look fools
Argentine men call the sexual shots
Someone has altered the rules
Fame on the wireless as far as it goes
Is all very well, but every girl knows
She needs a man she can monopolise
With fingers in dozens of different pies
In June of '43
There was a military coup
Behind it was a gang called
The G.O.U.
Who did not feel
The need to be elected
They had themselves a party
at the point of a gun
They were slightly to the right
of Attila the Hun
A bomb or two
And very few objected
Just one shell
And governments fall like flies
Ka-pow, die
They stumble and fall
Bye-bye
Backs to the wall
Aim high
We're having a ball
The tank and bullet ruled
As democracy died
The lady's got potential
She was setting her sights
On making it in movies
with her name in lights
The greatest social climber
since Cinderella
OK, she couldn't act
But she had the right friends
And we all know
a career depends
On knowing the right fella
To be stellar
Just one shell
And governments lose their nerve
That's how we get
The government we deserve
Now, the man behind the president
calling the shots
Involved so discreetly
in a lot of their plots
Was Colonel Juan Perón
Would-be dictator
He began in the army out in ltaly so
Saw Mussolini's rise
from the very front row
And reckoned he'd do likewise
Sooner or later
Just one blast
And the tear gas falls like rain
They haven't a chance
The terrorists advance
But one guy doesn't dirty his hands
Perón was biding time out
In the slow lane
Suddenly an earthquake hit
The town of San Juan
They stumble and fall
Keep away from the wall
But one guy
Was having a ball
The tragedy a golden chance for Perón
He organised a concert
With incredible flair
In aid of all the victims
Such a grand affair
Politicians, actors
Stars of every flavour
It was January 22, 1 944
A night to remember, that's for sure
For that's the night
That Perón first met Eva
On this night
On this night
On this night of 1 000 stars
Let me take you to heaven's door
Where the music of love's guitars
Plays for evermore
Your act hasn't changed much
Neither has yours
I stand here
as a servant of the people
As we come together
for a marvellous cause
You've shown by your presence
Your deeds and applause
What the people can do
True power is yours
Not the government's
Unless it represents
The people
One always picks
The easy fight
One praises fools
One smothers light
One shifts
From left to right
Politics
The art of the possible
I've heard so much about you
I'm amazed
- For I'm only an actress
- For I'm only a soldier
- Nothing to shout about
- One of the thousands
- Only a girl on the air
- Defending the country he loves
But when you act
The things you do affect us all
But when you act
You take us away
from the squalor of the real world
- Are you here on your own?
- Yes. Oh yes
So am I
What a fortunate coincidence
Maybe you're my reward
For my efforts here tonight
It seems crazy
But you must believe
There's nothing calculated
Nothing planned
Please forgive me
If I seem naive
I would never want to force your hand
But please understand I'd be good for you
I don't always rush in like this
20 seconds after saying hello
Telling strangers I'm too good to miss
If I'm wrong I hope you'll tell me so
But you really should know
I'd be good for you
I'd be surprisingly good for you
I won't go on if I'm boring you
But do you understand my point of view
Do you like what you hear
What you see
And would you be
Good for me too?
I'm not talking of a hurried night
A frantic tumble then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason
that I caught your eye
Which has to imply I'd be good for you
Please go on. You enthral me
I can understand you perfectly
And I like what I hear, what I see
And knowing me
I would be good for you too
I'm not talking
Of a hurried night
A frantic tumble
Then a shy goodbye
Creeping home before it gets too light
That's not the reason
That I caught your eye
Which has to imply I'd be good for you
There is no one, no one at all
Never has been, and never will be a lover
Male or female
Who hasn't an eye on
ln fact they rely on
Tricks they can try on their partner
They're hoping their lover
Will help them or keep them
Support them, promote them
Don't blame them, you're the same
Hello and goodbye
I've just unemployed you
You can go back to school
You've had a good run
I'm sure he enjoyed you
Don't act sad or surprised
Let's be friends, civilised
Come on, little one
Don't sit there like a dummy
The day you knew would arrive is here
You'll survive
So move, funny face
I like your conversation
You've a catchy turn of phrase
You're obviously going through
Some adolescent phase
So what happens now?
Where am I going to?
You'll get by, you always have before
Don't ask any more
At the watering-holes
Of the well-to-do
I detect a resistance to
Precisely
Our heroine's style
We're glad you noticed
The shooting sticks
Of the upper class
Give her an inch...
Aren't supporting a single ass
That would rise for the girl
...She'll take a mile
Such a shame she wandered
Into our enclosure
How unfortunate this person
Has forced us to be blunt
No, we wouldn't mind
Seeing her at Harrods
But behind the jewellery counter
Not in front
Could there be
In our fighting corps
A lack of enthusiasm for
Perón's latest flame?
You said it, brother
Should you wish
To cause great distress
In the tidiest officer's mess
Just mention her name
That isn't funny
Perón is a fool, breaking every taboo
Installing the girl in the army H.Q.
And she's an actress, the last straw
Her only good parts
Are between her thighs
She should stare at the ceiling
Not reach for the skies
Or she could be his last whore
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Dangerous Jade
We have allowed ourselves to slip
We have completely lost our grip
We have declined to an all-time low
Tarts have become the set to know
I'm only a radio star
with just one weekly show
But speaking as one of the people
I want you to know
We are tired of
The decline of Argentina
With no sign of
A government
able to give us the things we deserve
It's no crime for officers
to do as they please
As long as they're discreet
and keep clear of disease
We ignore, we disregard
But once they allow a bit on the side
To move to the centre
where she's not qualified
We are forced to mark his card
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
Slut
Dangerous Jade
This has really been your year
Miss Duarte
Tell us where you go from here
Miss Duarte
Which are the roles that you yearn to play?
Whom did you sleep...dine with
yesterday?
Acting is limiting
The lines not mine
That's no help to the Argentine
Can we assume then that you'll quit?
Is this because of your involvement
With Colonel Perón?
She won't be kept happy
by her nights on the tiles
She says it's his body
But she's after his files
So get back onto the street
She should get into her head
She should not get out of bed
She should know that she's not paid
To be loud, but to be laid
The evidence suggests
She has other interests
If it's her that's using him
He's exceptionally dim
Things have reached a pretty pass
When someone pretty lower class
Graceless and vulgar, uninspired
Can be accepted and admired
Dice are rolling
The knives are out
Would-be presidents are all around
I don't say they mean harm
But they'd each give an arm
To see us six feet underground
It doesn't matter
What those morons say
Our nation's leaders are a feeble crew
There's only 20 of them anyway
What is 20 next to millions who
Are looking to you?
All you have to do is sit and wait
Keeping out of everybody's way
We'll... You'll be handed power
On a plate
When the ones who matter
Have their say
And with chaos installed
You can reluctantly agree
To be called
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
For distance lends enchantment
And that is why
All exiles
Are distinguished
More important, they're not dead
I could find job satisfaction in Paraguay
This is crazy defeatist talk
Why commit political suicide
There's no risk
There's no call for any action at all
When you have unions on your side
A new Argentina
The chains of the masses untied
The voice of the people
Cannot be denied
There is only one man
who can lead any workers' regime
He lives for your problems
He shares your ideals and your dream
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
A new Argentina
The workers' battle song
The voice of the people
Rings out loud and long
Now, I am a worker
I've suffered the way that you do
I've been unemployed
And I've starved, and I've hated it too
But I found my salvation in Perón
May the nation let him save them
As he saved me
A new age about to begin
We face the world together
And no dissent within
There again we could be foolish
Not to quit while we're ahead
I can see us many miles away, inactive
Sipping cocktails on a terrace
Taking breakfast in bed
Sleeping easy, doing nothing
It's attractive
Don't think I don't think like you
I often get those nightmares too
They always take some swallowing
Sometimes it's very difficult to keep
Momentum, if it's you that you are following
Don't close doors
Keep an escape clause
Because we might lose
The Big Apple
But would I have done what I did
If I hadn't thought
If I hadn't known
We would take the country?
Perón has resigned from the army
and this we avow
The descamisados are those
he is marching with now
He supports you, for he loves you
Understands you, is one of you
If not
How could he love me?
Release him.
