I'm really sorry.
Does he wear glasses or contact lenses?
Glasses.
You'll have to hurry up.
He decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.
His back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past
when the pain was intolerable.
He was thinking his wife
didn't love him at all any more.
He didn't burst into tears and he didn't think
that the first thing people most people do
when they realize someone
doesn't love them anymore is cry.
Sir, do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me?
That'll do. Thank you.
Have you ever been on your own before?
No, never.
Are you allergic to any foods?
No.
Your last relationship
lasted how many years?
Around 12.
Do you remember how long exactly, sir?
11 years and one month.
- Sexual preference?
- Women.
However, I had one homosexual
experience in the past,
in college.
Is there a bisexual option available?
No, sir, this option is no longer available
since about last summer,
due to several operational problems.
I'm afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered
as a homosexual or a heterosexual.
I think I should be registered
as a heterosexual.
- Any children, sir?
- No.
And the dog?
My brother. He was here a couple of years
ago but he didn't make it.
You might remember him:
medium build, 48 years old,
bald patch, blond hair.
I'm afraid not, sir.
OK, I would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters.
And sign it, please.
That will do. Thank you very much.
OK, so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts.
These are only for the couples.
You can use facilities for individual
sports, such as squash and golf.
You can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days.
You'll be staying in a single room.
If everything goes well and you make it,
you'll be moved to a double room.
I'm afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings.
We will provide everything you need.
As far as garments, accessories
and shoes are concerned.
- You can keep this.
- Thank you.
Shoe size, please?
Forty-four and a half.
Forty-four of forty-five?
There are no half sizes.
Forty-five.
If you need a haircut,
call reception one day ahead.
Smoking is not allowed.
That way you'll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired
and your breath won't smell when you kiss.
Enjoy your stay.
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?
- That's right.
- Great.
His room number was 101.
A tranquilizer gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed.
On the table were 20 tranquilizer darts,
a black plastic watch,
a pair of sunglasses and a cologne for men.
Inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers,
four identical button-down shirts
in white and blue,
a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer,
a striped tie and a white bathrobe.
He looked out the window.
The unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground.
"Thank God they wear those
waterproof ponchos," he thought.
Room 195.
Two loners, two extra days.
Room 272.
One loner, one extra day.
Hello. I'm the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner.
We'd like to welcome you.
You're one of the lucky ones.
You have one of our superior rooms,
which means you have a view.
- Did you read the leaflet?
- Yes, I did.
Very good. Now the fact
that you'll turn into an animal
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here
is not something that should upset you,
or get you down.
Just think as an animal you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.
But even then, you must be careful.
You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.
A wolf and a penguin
could never live together,
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus.
That would be absurd.
Think about it.
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.
But it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically,
for all possible outcomes.
Now, have you thought of what animal
you'd like to be if you end up alone?
- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?
Because lobsters live
for over 100 years,
are blue-blooded like aristocrats
and stay fertile all their lives.
I also like the sea very much.
I water-ski and swim quite well,
since I was a teenager.
I must congratulate you. The first thing
most people think of is a dog,
which is why the world is full of dogs.
Very few people choose an unusual
animal, which is why they are endangered.
A lobster is an excellent choice.
Could you stand for us, please?
This is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something
rather than just one.
We tend to forget that from time to time.
The handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow.
- It's alright, Bob.
- I hope you enjoy your stay with us.
Goodbye.
Have a good day.
Good morning.
Room 101.
44 days left.
Breakfast is served.
Sit where you like.
His first day was one he'd never forget.
Near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back.
Later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds.
Next to her sat her best friend.
He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee,
and thought about his wife for a moment.
A woman who seemed to like
butter biscuits
offered one to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.
He then looked behind him
and saw a woman
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless.
And some others in the couples area,
whom he'd never meet
during his stay at the hotel.
That morning, he was really hungry.
He could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I've decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend.
Let me introduce you. This is Robert.
He stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm staying in room 101.
I'm on the same floor. I'm 186.
- Would you like to join us?
- Why not?
One of these days, it's gonna be me
on one of those yachts.
What are those yachts?
It's the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one.
15 days of vacation,
just a couple, alone.
- Didn't you read the leaflet?
- I did.
Have you seen John's leg?
No.
John, would you show your leg?
Oh, yeah.
Room 187, day two.
Hello, everyone.
My mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman
who was better at math than she was.
She had a postgraduate degree, I think,
whereas my mother was only a graduate.
I was 19 at the time.
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.
I really missed her.
I found out she'd been moved to a zoo.
I often went there to see her.
I'd give her raw meat.
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,
so I used to give a little
bit to each of them.
One day,
I decided to enter the enclosure
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.
I climbed the fence and jumped in.
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,
all but two, who stood motionless.
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,
which is also my defining characteristic.
My wife died six days ago.
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.
She had a limp too.
Thank you, John.
You can return to your seat now.
Let's move on to our next guest.
Room 104, day two.
Hello, everyone.
This is only my second day here,
but already I feel like a member
of a wonderful group.
My defining characteristic
is that I have a very beautiful smile.
♪ Something's gotten hold of my heart
♪ Keeping my soul and my senses apart
♪ Something has gotten into my life
Have you ever danced with anybody?
Sorry?
Have you ever danced with anybody?
Yes.
What sort of dancing did you do?
Just depends on the music.
Do you need to sit down?
- No, no, no, I'm getting ready to dance.
- Ah.
♪ In a time there was peace
with no trouble at all
Can I sit here?
♪ But then you came my way
Sorry.
♪ And a feeling inside shook my heart
♪ Made me want you to stay
♪ All of my life
- Can I sit here?
- Of course.
Let me introduce you to my best friend.
That woman you were talking to
has no feelings whatsoever.
She feels nothing at all.
She's the best hunter in the hotel,
silent and very fast.
She's the women's record holder,
192 captives.
♪ Changing the grey, changing the blue
♪ Scarlet for me, scarlet for you
Would you like to dance?
♪ Every day

♪ Dragging my soul to a beautiful land
♪ Something's gotten into my life
I'm sorry, I've got blood on your shirt.
But don't worry, there are many ways to
remove bloodstains from clothing.
One way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt.
Another way is to scrub the stains
with cotton wool dipped in ammonia.
The third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste, like toothpaste,
especially if the clothes are delicate
or brightly colored.
But just never use warm water
on blood, ever.
OK.
♪ But then you, you, you
♪ You
♪ You came my way
♪ But then you came my way
♪ And a feeling I know shook my heart
♪ Made me want you to stay
♪ All of my nights and all of my days
I think I have to rest for a little bit.
My leg's hurting.
That's OK.
Well, let me know when
you feel better and we can dance again.
♪ And my senses apart
♪ Something has invaded my night
♪ Painting my sleep

Leave the building in an orderly fashion.
Do hurry up but please be careful.
Nobody needs to get hurt or injured.
And good luck with the hunt.
I wish I didn't have this limp.
I used to be very good at running
but not any more.
I'm sure I'll be slower than them.
If I were you, I'd think of some tricks
that use the element of surprise
instead of speed.
You're right.
That's what I'll do.

Breakfast is served.
Man eats alone.
How many darts did you use yesterday?
12.
Please take off your trousers
and sit on the bed.
Can we not do this today? It's awful.
I know. But I'm afraid we have to do it.
And you have no idea how much
it helps you psychologically
in your search for a partner.
Man eats with woman.
Lie down.
Spread your legs. More.
- Is your room number 186?
- Yes, it is.
I imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted
in the rooms
or any other area of the hotel.
Yes.
And yet it has brought to my attention
that you continue to do it.
Today you became erect quicker
than on other days. That's good.
Please, just a little longer.
Have a good day.
That's awful. Just awful.
Were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating?
Yes.
What did the photograph show?
A naked woman on a horse in the country.
If I were in your shoes, I would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse.
I'm sure that the horse was once
a weak and cowardly man just like you.
Woman walks alone.
Help.
Help.
Help.
This is not necessary. Please.
- It was an accident. I got carried away.
- Please.
- This is not necessary.
- Please place your hand in the toaster.
This could be a warning.
Look, I've been good otherwise, I
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please.
Please, please, that's hurting.
Woman walks with man.
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,
is to wash your body
and your head really well.
How do you know?
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.
No waiters know about the procedure,
they're not allowed inside that room.
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin,
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body
with a laser or scalpels.
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen.
That makes total sense.
I mean, I suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work
than fowls, for example.
Exactly.
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts
into the casks outside
the hotel's restaurant
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.
Why is that?
The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.
I think I saw a woman with a limp.
It's just a sprained ankle.
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.
That's a shame.
That is a shame indeed.
One night on the coach, he sat next to
the woman who liked butter biscuits.
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,
just trying to avoid talking to her.
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.
And that was a really good one.
These biscuits are for Bob.
I want you to give them to him
whenever you want to reward him
for something.
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex
if that's your thing.
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.
But let's not talk about him.
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.
I haven't caught any the last few nights.
Hope you catch lots too.
Thank you very much.
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,
I'm gonna kill myself
by throwing myself out of one of the rooms.
Out of the window.
I want you to know that.
My room is on the first floor.
"I hope I catch some loners today,"
she said.
"And I hope you catch lots too."
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,
320, maybe, or one higher up.
480, that would be even better.
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.
He then looked out at the woods
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.
Not bad. Bit higher.
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?
A lobster.
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.
Why don't you become parrots too?
And then we'll all be together.
You're a complete idiot,
picking one of the few animals
that can talk
when you have a speech impediment.
You'll lisp, even as an animal.
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,
and they'll suck out what little
flesh you have with their mouths.
You're pathetic, both of you.
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.
Or when we're on one of our trips.
Friends.
I'm not afraid.
Room 187, please.
It's no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples.
Hello.
- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.
Thank,
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?
I like all strokes equally.
You know, I love breaststroke.
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."
And then they laugh.
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.
- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.
Really?
Ah, no.
This happens to me all the time.
It's really, really annoying.
I know. I have a nosebleed problem too.
I saw what you did.
It must have hurt.
Is it coming out?
No.
- Yes.
- Can I use a tissue?
Yes.
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.
What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal
or to have a nosebleed
from time to time?
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.
- Exactly.
- Mm.
- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.
I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.
We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.
- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.
Congratulations.
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely
by our staff and by me personally.
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,
that you cannot resolve yourselves,
you will be assigned children.
That usually helps, a lot.
Good morning, room 101.
Seven days left.
Breakfast is served.
You have really nice hair.
I know.
Look.
How do you like mine?
Well, I think you have quite dry hair.
The color is OK, though.
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.
And even if someday I lose my hair,
there are things I can do to get my hair back.
I can have a hair transplant.
- You can always tell when someone's had a hair transplant.
- I know.
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?
I'm still thinking about it.
Morning, ladies.
So today is your last day.
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.
What I always say in these situations is,
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...
for example,
read a work of classic literature
or sing a song you really like.
It would be silly to choose
for example a walk in the grounds,
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,
because those are things
you can do as an animal.
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,
which is really very touching.
"We always sat together at school.
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it
because you always gave the best advice.
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.
I'm sorry that things have come to this.
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,
because you're an admirable person,
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.
I'll miss you.
And however many new girlfriends I make in
a few days when I move back into the city,
I don't think I'll find another as true."
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland
and Richard Dreyfus. Alone.
Excellent choice.
Lovely film.
Please leave a message.
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.
We'll talk later.
Bye.
One day, as he was playing golf,
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend
that you do have feelings when you don't
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.
He also thought that he liked her accent,
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.
So he decided that she was the one.
During the hunt, he would follow her,
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquilizer ones.
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,
"I hope he dies right away."
Did anyone see what happened?
What happened?
She jumped from the window of room 180.
There's blood and biscuits everywhere.
I hope she dies right away.
On second thoughts
I hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies.
I just hope her pathetic screams
can't be heard from my room.
Because I was thinking about having
a lie-down and I need peace and quiet.
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.
The last thing I need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly.
I can't hear you with all this screaming.
We'll talk some other time
when it's quieter.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
One message.
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.
We'll talk later.
Bye.
Mind if I join you?
Martini?
I think we are a match.
Yes, I think so too.
The keys to the double room, please.
I wish you the best of luck.
We all wish you the best of luck.
Do you normally sleep
on the left side of the bed or the right?
- The right. You?
- The left.
Perfect.
Spread your legs.
Should I turn off the light
or would you like to read?
I'd like to read.
Does the light bother you?
No.
I'm not bothered by light or noise.
I'm a deep sleeper.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
- This is our new daughter.
Her name's Elizabeth.
Elizabeth, give the nice man a kiss.
He's a friend of mine.
The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl.
Come on, move away.
Don't cry, Elizabeth, you should thank me.
Now you'll have a limp
and be more like your father.
What was that sound?
Did you say something?
No.
Do you mind if we fuck in a position
where I can see your face?
Sure.
Turn the light on please,
so I can see you better.
Good morning.
Morning.
I killed your brother.
I left him to die very slowly.
He may not be dead yet even as we speak.
I was kicking him for ages.
Doesn't matter.
He whined a little,
a strange kind of bark.
Something like this.
It must have been from the pain.
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.
You really are a deep sleeper.
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'd love some.
As soon as I wash my face
and brush my teeth, though.
I can't wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night,
about that student of
yours at the university
and his awful final project.
It's really a very funny story.
His name was Ryess -
R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.
These aren't tears, it's just water.
I just washed my face.
I knew you were lying.
I can't understand why you did it,
when you know as well as anyone that a
relationship cannot be built on a lie.
We're going to the hotel manager right now
and you'll get the punishment you deserve.
What's the punishment for this?
They turn you into the animal
no one wants to be.
I saw your partner running back that way.
He looked frantic.
Is everything OK?
At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother.
Take her legs, please.
He thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again,
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach.
But then he thought
there wouldn't be much point,
because she was already unconscious
and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kicks, or the knife.
You have to shoot me
so they won't suspect I helped you.
A hotel maid helped him.
He couldn't understand why she did it.
So he decided to turn her into an animal.
He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.
I asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into,
but he always gave me the same answer:
"That's none of your concern."
That night,
he left the hotel once and for all.
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed.
But he was headed towards us.
This was the start of his new life.
And back then, he didn't know
how much it hurts to be alone,
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain-relief ointment on your back,
and you are constantly in pain.
I found him in the woods.
He escaped from the hotel.
Are you a doctor, by any chance?
- No.
- That's a pity.
We need a doctor around.
We had one, but they caught him
a couple of months ago.
I'm an architect.
That's OK.
So, welcome.
You can stay with us
for as long as you like.
You can be a loner until the day you die.
There is no time limit.
Thank you very much.
By the way,
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.
And any such acts are punished.
Is that clear?
Can I have a conversation with someone?
Of course you can.
So as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that.
That applies to dance nights as well.
We all dance by ourselves,
that's why we only play electronic music.
What happened to your mouth?
He can't speak.
He was given the Red Kiss.
What's the Red Kiss?
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,
and we forced them to kiss each other.
That was a couple of days ago now.
But the cuts were deep and they're still in pain.
They were flirting, you know.
Some punishments
are worse than other punishments.
Having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved.
And having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit
is worse than having your leg kicked.
The punishment I am afraid of
isn't the Red Kiss but another one,
that is called the Red Intercourse.
I have never seen it happen,
but it's not difficult to imagine what it means.
Oh, my God, I am so afraid of it.
Move.
Hide.
Move.
Hide.
That was the first time I saw him.
He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.
He seemed quite presentable.
The next day, in the city,
he found out that I was short-sighted too.
That night in my sleep,
I dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city,
with a large well-lit kitchen,
and I was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse.
And he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse.
And as he was fucking me,
a thug came into the kitchen,
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us,
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one.
I woke up terrified.
Try harder.
Don't give up. You know you should
have been more careful.
Try harder or they'll find you and you'll
be turned into an animal - a weak one.
We must get a move on now.
It's really too dangerous to stay here.
If you manage to free yourself,
run as fast as you can and come find us.
If you manage to free yourself
but think you'll die from the bleeding,
go straight to your grave.
Have you dug your own grave?
Yes.
Very good.
That's enough for now.
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.
They're delicious and quite rare.
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.
You're going to need a pig.
They're impossible to find otherwise.
- I know.
- Don't be long.
- Gotta get them back in 50 minutes.
- OK.
Hello, David.
Hello, Robert.
What you did to that woman was dreadful.
She killed my brother.
I would have done the same thing
if she'd killed you.
You're like a brother to me. Oh,
you're my best friend in the whole world.
I don't think I'm your best friend
in the whole world.
You used to spend much more time
with John.
Oh, who's John?
- John, the Limping Man.
- Oh, yeah.
I didn't even remember his name.
Or his face.
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.
Nevertheless, did John make it?
They're getting ready for the yacht.
It all begins this week.
Everyone says they're gonna make it
as they're perfectly suited
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing.
- That's great.
- You're not thinking about coming back?
You know, if you told the hotel manager
about your brother,
she'd probably forgive you.
No, it's really nice to be on your own.
There's no one tying you down.
You listen to music whenever you like,
you masturbate whenever you want,
go for walks whenever you like,
have a chat whenever you like.
I don't miss companionship at all.
I just miss you,
'cause you were my one true friend.
Are you gonna shoot me?
I'm afraid so.
I only have two days left.
What did you say?
I can't understand the way you speak.
I'm going to shoot you. I only
have two days left, I need more time.
Do you actually believe another day
will make a difference?
Have you seen how ugly you are?
You haven't got a chance.
If I was a woman, I ...
Don't tell anyone I helped you.
If you want to repay me, there is a way.
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.
Do you promise?
- Yes.
- Bye.
Bye.
[In French] - Hello
- Hello
[In Fr.] -You brought what I asked for?
-Of course.
[Fr.] The gun is in the pocket with the electronic keys
with the numbers of the double rooms.
[Fr.] Try not to lose the keys, I need to return them.
[Fr.] I propose we act on Saturday.  After the ball, everyone is tired,
and most employees are gone on the week-end.
[Fr.] -And the shampoo?
-I forgot. I'll bring two bottles next time.
[Fr.] Do you know how fantastic you are?
Please make a note for the shampoo so you don't forget.
[Fr.] - I need to tell you something.
- What?
[Fr.] This is my last mission. I can't do it anymore.
I can't stand living in that horrible mansion with that fat dentist.
[Fr.] He keeps asking if I've flossed.  He makes me clean my
teeth after every meal, no matter how small it is.
[Fr.] After we're finished setting up for the big night,
you can come and live with us.  I'll find another mole.
[Fr.] I don't think I'll ever find someone as
efficient as you, but I need to respect your wishes.
[Fr.] Be patient just a few more days, and don't
forget to take your birth control pill. Ok?
[Fr.] -Thank you.
-No, thank you. You were fantastic.
You carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head.
You then slice open its belly and stuff it
with well-washed red and green peppers,
not too spicy,
and a little garlic and mint.
You then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour.
That's my favorite food,
rabbit.
Woman, brunette, 50 years old.
Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.
My husband's away on a business trip.
Yeah, OK. Can I have a look?
Hands.
No dirt under her nails
or mud on her shoes.
9 Belsize Road.
- So your husband is away?
- Yes.
- Where?
- Far.
Good morning, sir. Are you here alone?
Good morning, Officer.
No, I'm here with my partner.
She's inside one of the stores,
shopping right now.
Can I see your certificate, please?
My partner keeps it in her purse.
You see, I am losing it all the time.
I see.
And what store is she shopping in?
Oh, here she is.
I'm sorry, darling.
They had such a huge variety
of pain-relief ointment.
I bought you this one.
I hope it's the one you were looking for.
That's wonderful, dear.
Can I have my certificate, please?
Of course, darling.
Would you like to see mine also, Officer?
No, that's OK.
Thank you, sir.
- You have a good day.
- Thank you, Officer. You have a good day.
- Madam.
- Sir.
If I'm walking too slowly,
just say, and I'll pick up my pace.
This pace is fine.
Maybe don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palm's getting a little sweaty.
- Better?
- Yes.
Much better.
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?
Yes, contact lens solution
and a Parker Rollerball.
I didn't know you were short-sighted.
I'm short-sighted too.
Will you stay a few days?
I'm afraid not, Papa.
We're heading back again today.
Tomorrow I'm going away
on a business trip.
You know how demanding my job is.
Don't ask if I can stay a few days
every time I come.
Do you all work for the same company?
- Yes.
- Yes.
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.
Do you agree?
- It's a rather good company.
- It is.
- One of the best, I'd say.
- Mm.
The only problem with the job
is that I don't have enough time
for my wife and kids.
We have four beautiful children.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
But even if we'd never had children,
I would never dream of leaving my wife.
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own,
we'd go on trips.
We'd go to Portofino in Italy
or go to a Greek island for the summer.
And so our relationship
would be as intense as it was at the start.
I love my wife so much
I could die for her.
That's how much I love her.
For your first day in the city,
you did great.
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.
Thank you very much.
When did you become short-sighted?
When I was 16.
You?
When I was 12.
What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?
I don't remember.
- Do you have astigmatism too?
- Yes.
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back
on the bits you can't reach on your own?
I'd like that.
Here?
A little lower, please.
- Here?
- Yes.
"Hello, everyone, and good luck.
The room numbers are as follows:
room 306, the hotel manager
and her partner.
They both,
they both have nice voices.
Room 240: couple who both love to ski.
Room 282: couple who
both studied social sciences.
Name of yacht Bliss:
couple prone to nosebleeds."
You and you take 306.
You and you take 240.
You take 282.
And you two, take the yacht.
Can I go to the yacht?
OK, then, so you take the yacht.
And you take 282.
And us three,
we'll take the manager's room.
We have 40 minutes.
You need to speak with the manager.
Wake up.
Get up.
Sit in that seat over there.
Put your hand behind your back.
A basketball weighs
between 550 and 650 grams.
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.
Yes.
The weight's different
for men's and women's games,
but that's roughly how much it weighs.
Do you know how much a volleyball weighs?
No, but I'd like to find out.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I have something to tell you.
His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.
He bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood, or something like that.
Or he cuts it with a penknife
when you're not looking.
You two are not suited.
Shut up. Dad, tell him to leave.
I'm sleepy.
And, and I'm quite sure
that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood,
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup
or red watercolor paint
or something like that.
Or beetroot juice.
Do you love her?
With all my heart.
How much do you love her,
on a scale of 1 to 15?
14.
14 is a very impressive score.
He loves her very much indeed.
Who do you think we should kill?
Who will be able to live
on their own better?
Here's a knife, Mum. Kill him.
You'd better get out while you still can.
OK.
That's all I came to say, anyway.
You.
If this woman dies,
d'you think you'll manage on your own?
Or will you get involved
with someone else?
No.
I can live alone, she can't.
I'm on my own for hours
when she's running the hotel.
I like sitting in the room.
It relaxes me, calms me.
I like it a lot.
I can definitely live on my own.
Be quiet.
Take it.
Shoot her.
No.
No, no.
No, God, no.
I'm going to fucking kill your arse.
Don't you fucking care?
Where were you?
I was looking for you.
I was masturbating
behind those trees over there.
Why aren't you dancing?
My leg's a little sore.
Did you dig your grave?
Not yet.
I don't mean to pressure you,
or to ruin the mood
now that we're celebrating,
but at some point you'll have to do it.
Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave
for you or to carry your corpse.
We'll throw some dirt over you
but that's about it.
Tomorrow find a spot you like,
where the ground isn't too rocky,
and make a start.
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.
As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and I said to him,
"Honey, the dinner's ready.
However, I'm not sure I can eat right now.
One of my front teeth hurts a lot.
Can you take a look please, dear?"
"Yes, sure, no problem," he said.
And the minute he turned his head,
I took the drill and I shoved it into his chest.
That story sounds really interesting
but I have to leave.
I just remembered I left some batteries
next to a tree down there.
And the last thing I want is to lose them.
Sorry.
Did you catch rabbits?
- No, someone brought me them.
- Who?
A friend of mine.
- Do you want one?
- No.
You don't need to accept rabbits
from other people.
If you need more rabbits, just ask,
and I'll bring you more.
Catching a rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.
There's no need for you
to be indebted to the others.
Thank you very much.
The man who brought you the rabbits,
is he short-sighted?
I don't know. I don't think so.
OK.
Is that a sparrow up in that tree?
I can't really see that far.
But I don't think so.
- Are you short-sighted?
- No.
You're lying.
It's the truth.
What does it say here?
YKK.
You knew that already.
All zips say the same thing.
I'm not short-sighted.
I don't understand
why you won't believe me.
I can see really clearly.
I used to be a pilot.
You're wearing contact lenses.
I don't wear contact lenses.
I'm not short-sighted, I swear.
You are.
You think I'm an idiot and can't tell.
Let me see.
Let me see. I want to see your eyes.
Look up.
Look up.
Up, up.
Look down now.
Look left.
Look right.
Up again.
I'm sorry.
I thought you were trying to fool me.
I'm sorry.
For this synchronization exercise,
we have to fully concentrate,
as we both have to press "play"
at exactly the same time.
Why don't we just use one headset?
Because that's the whole point.
This is an exercise for us.
We have to be totally synchronized.
OK.
- I'm ready.
- OK.

We've developed a code
so that we can communicate with each other,
even in front of the others,
without them knowing what we are saying.
When we turn our heads to the left,
it means,
"I love you more
than anything in the world."
And when we turn our heads to the right,
it means,
"Watch out, we're in danger."
We had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up
"I love you more than anything in the world"
with "Watch out, we're in danger."
When we raise our left arm, it means,
"I want to dance in your arms."
When we make a fist and put it
behind our backs, it means,
"Let's fuck."
The code grew and grew as time went by.
And within a few weeks,
we could talk about almost anything
without even opening our mouths.
Stop it.
That's enough.
Show my parents some respect.
They are playing you music.
- That's OK.
- No, Mother, it is not OK.
Please continue.
Do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else?
Something else.
Didn't her parents play beautifully?
Yes, they did.
It was wonderful.
We love each other and we suit each other.
And that's the reason
why we've decided to leave the woods
and stay together forever in the city.
Tomorrow during the hunt,
we're going to disappear and everyone
will think we've been captured,
and that we're going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something.
I think the first thing I'm going to do
when I get into the city
is buy a bathrobe.
And then we'll go to a pool with a
high diving board, perfect for diving.
"And we'll do
lots of different things together,
serious things, not silly ones,
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together."
[In Fr.] -It stops there. There are notes
on the back, but I don't think it's important.
-Read the notes.
"Portofino. Italian fishing village
and upmarket resort,
famous for its picturesque harbour.
Population: 439.
Beaches nearby:
Paraggi Beach, Camogli,
Chiavari and Lavagna.
Serifos: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades."
[In Fr.] - Where did you find that?
- By the river.
[Fr.] Give it to me. I'll take care of it.
Can you imagine why I brought you
to such a quiet place today?
No.
Because I think it's the perfect spot
for your grave.
Now cover yourself with soil.
Use you hands.
Over your face too.
You wouldn't want your face to get
eaten by dogs, would you?
If you die before me,
I'll visit you as often as I can.
I promise.
I think we should leave right now.
The three of us coming here instead of
two or four is very dangerous.
Why didn't we think of that earlier?
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us.
I suggest that we leave
the first chance we get.
Right now, in fact.
Don't be afraid.
No one will suspect a thing.
I bet you weren't expecting this surprise.
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it is.
Still, I'd like a few days
just to think it over, so that
I could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city.
What's there to think about?
If it's better to see clearly
or to be short-sighted? Is that it?
That's absurd, you know that.
Anyway, this doctor is the best there is.
And it's really very difficult
to get an appointment.
I called him months ago
to get him to see you today.
She's blind.
Thank you.
Throw down your knife and stand up.
Why did you have to blind me?
You could have blinded him.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
The drugs are messing with your head.
If I were you, I would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing.
Now get up and give me your knife
or I'll hit you and take it by force.
- Here I come.
- I swear I'm going to kill you.
Let go of my hair, you're hurting me.
Just think, that when someone goes blind
one of the other senses
is heightened.
You could also catch a dog in the woods
and train it to guide you.
Dogs can do that, you know.
I'll help you catch a dog myself.
Now calm down,
or I'm going to leave you here
and I don't think you'll manage
to find Meeting Point 2 on your own.
Are you enjoying the view?
Sure.
What happened to your hand?
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and I cut myself by accident.
You look handsome today,
did you get your hair cut?
Thank you.
No, I didn't get a haircut.
I'm going to get my hair cut today.
Look what I brought you.
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm so hungry, I'll eat it right away.
It's a bigger flashlight.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit.
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen.
Oh.
Are you ready for tonight?
Of course I am.
I want to tell you something
but please don't be angry.
OK. What's wrong?
I can't see anything.
I'm blind.
What do you mean?
There's no point in lying to you,
you'll find out sooner or later.
Our leader blinded me in the city.
She must have realized
that I love you and you love me
and that we were going to run away
to the city together.
I'm sorry.
You can't see at all?
No, not at all.
And when you asked if I'd had my hair cut?
I was just saying that
so you wouldn't realize
that I can't see.
I'm sorry.
Don't cry.
Crying will make your eyes hurt more.
We'll find a way.

I could teach you German.
But it would take at least a year for you

Good afternoon.
How are you?
Fine.
I'm hungry.
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days.
Or things for me to touch and guess.
I've got good news.
I've had a great idea.
Have you a minute?
What kind of idea?
I raise my left foot,
I bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice.
I bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times.
I lie face down, I kneel down.
I touch my left cheek
and then lie face up.
Are you sure you're prepared to do that?
Yes, of course I'm sure.
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.
When?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
We should speed up a little.
I can't go much faster.
The trousers are too tight. I'm sorry.
It was dark and I couldn't see clearly.
And I didn't have time to try them on.
I'm sorry.
Never mind.
There's a bus coming.
It was the hotel coach.
They didn't see us.
Profile.
Fingers.
Elbows.
Would you like me to show you my belly?
No.
I, I remember your belly very well.
Smile.
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.
Certainly.
Thank you.
I'm going to do it with a knife.
Do you want me to come with you?
I'd rather you didn't.
Don't worry.
It's strange at first,
but then you get used to it.
And your other senses are heightened --
touch, for example, and hearing.
I know.
I won't be long.
Thank you very much.
