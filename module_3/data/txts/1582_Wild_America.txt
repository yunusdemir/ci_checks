No matter how
fast I ran, or how far...
I never got away.
But I didn't die.
I wouldn't give
them the pleasure.
Sure, there are two
sides to every story,
but not this one.
This is my story.
The story of how I made it.
How I survived
my big brothers.
Don't even think about
touching that belt
till you reach 15.
They said
this experiment would
cure my fear of heights.
I'm not sure that I ever
had a fear of heights.
That is, until they started
putting me up here.
They were most dangerous
when they had a camera
in their hands.
They had a camera
in their hands a lot.
My big brothers told me these
experiments built character.
They said it was
for my own good.
This is for your
own good! Okay?
One, 1,000!
Get ready to fire!
Two, 1,000!
MARSHALMost of the time,
they were fairly normal.
But when they
rolled that camera,
things got a little crazy.
Six... Seven...
Bombs away!
Eight, 1,000!
Nine, 1,000!
All right!
MARSHALI got used
to the firecrackers.
I had to. They said
every good movie
needs an explosion.
Whoo!
Yeah! Way to go, Marshall!
You beat my record
by three seconds!
Yeah, that's great, Mark.
Marshall,
you better not be thinking
about dripping water
through this house.
If you boys have been
throwing firecrackers
in that pool again,
I'm going to beat your butts
till your nose bleeds!
MARSHALMama loved
wild animals.
We had lots of them.
Most of them were
orphaned or hurt.
In Fort Smith, we were
known as the people
you took them to.
But of all the animals
we took care of,
my favorite was Leona.
She'd broken her wing.
But with my help,
I knew she could fly again.
Marty's favorite guy
was Ernest Hemingway.
He liked to think of himself
as a great hunter and
adventurer like Ernie-Bob.
Mark's favorite guy was...
Mark.
He liked to think of himself
as a man of action,
and a handsome ladies' man.
Me? I was a dreamer.
I'm thinking dinosaur.
Rabbit lying down.
Could be a hog head.
Big old skunk.
Or a turtle.
Chevy bumper...
MARSHALLeon had been
in the Air Force with my dad.
They used to patch up
fighter planes,
then Dad would take them
up and test them.
After the war, he followed
my dad home and lived
with us ever since.
Bushel basket.
Gold spud. Nope...
Definitely a rabbit
laying down.
How's her wing coming?
I want to fly with
her someday, Leon.
You will too, Marshall.
I believe you will.
I better finish my chores.
Your daddy's coming
home tomorrow.
It wasn't
a fighter or anything.
Just an old army trainer.
But me and Dad
called it the Skybolt.
Dad was fixing it up
so we could fly
together some day.
He picked her up
for 300 bucks
and a carburetor
for a '52 Buick.
Man, I loved to sit in her.
I'd fly everywhere,
see things no one
had ever seen before.
Dad said my legs
weren't short,
the pedals were
just too far away.
Oh, man, Stouffer,
this piece of crap
ain't never going to be
ready for Saturday.
Be there and find out, D.C.
You be there
to watch me kick your butt.
Oh, yeah? That
I'd like to see.
All you're gonna see
is my tail pipe.
Marty says now that
he's graduating,
he's going out to Africa
to shoot big game,
just like Ernie-Bob Hemingway.
Ain't that
right, Marty?
That's right.
At least I don't plan
on hanging around here
dipping carburetors for
the rest of my life like Mark!
Quit fooling
yourself, Stouffer.
You ain't going nowhere.
Hey, I'll try
a sip of that.
Hey, Julie Anne.
Don't waste your time
with that root beer, girl.
I got the good
stuff right here.
Have yourself a taste.
Hey, hit the lights.
Showtime.
MARSHALThere were two
movie theaters in Fort Smith.
The Starlight on Main Street
and our garage.
Everyone had their
favorite parts they liked
to watch over and over.
Especially the
dangerous stuff.
Like when Marty skiied
through the ring of fire.
Marty loved it when
everyone laughed.
They always laughed the
loudest when Mark blew me up.
D.C. supplied
the sound effects.
D.C. liked anything
where people had a good
chance of getting hurt.
You are so mean.
I like it.
My favorite was
when Mark tried to fly.
Check this out.
Man, that was so bad!
MARSHALMark liked
movie night for
reasons all his own.
While everyone else was
watching the movie,
Mark would practice his Romeo
routines on Julie Anne.
Hey, Mark. Good thing
you landed on your head.
Even though
they'd seen it
a hundred times,
they always laughed
and cheered.
It made Mark, Marty and me
feel kind of good.
Check this out.
Outdoor Life has
an Indian story
from some old
trapper's journal.
"And the medicine man said,
'In the land of eagle people,
"'in northern mountains,
"'far into the snow where
trees don't grow,
"'there is a cave filled with
a thousand sleeping bears.'"
Wow.
You win every time you
pull the trigger.
"Up there,
the vapors rise from
the center of the Earth
"and the snoring of the bears
is like thunder that rumbles
through the mountains..."
Run! Go, go, go!
Come on, Marty! Let's go!
Where's all
our troubles?
Out back, working.
What's for dinner?
Fried chicken.
Fried chicken and what?
Lima beans.
Canned ones you like.
Salad. Peach pie
for dessert.
Store-bought?
What do you take me for?
Go clean up.
Go and try to stop
those boys of yours
from working long enough
and get them to eat.
Now, go on.
You said it was homemade.
I said, "What do
you take me for?"
You know what
a white lie is?
It's when you say something
other than the truth
to make somebody feel better.
So nobody's feelings get hurt.
Besides, with all the tobacco
your father smokes,
he won't know the difference
between something he paid
for and the real thing.
Get rid of that.
MARSHALWhen Dad came home,
things were different.
He had his own set of rules,
right down to who got
what piece of chicken.
Give your mother
one of those legs.
Salad.
Mark, thank you.
The best part
about Dad being home
was we could get down
to business on Skybolt.
Which meant I better
know my stuff.
Hand check the ailerons,
check the rudder,
charge the magneto,
prime the fuel pump...
How about the mixture?
Mixture to full rich.
Throttle?
Ease the throttle forward.
Flaps?
Flaps to the second notch.
Watch your tachometer.
Green is go.
Good.
Dad?
Tell me about the clouds.
You slice through
them like butter
and pop out the other side.
All you got is the bluest
sky you can think of.
Birds get out
of the way, right?
They see you coming
a mile away.
Go to bed now, squirt.
It's late.
Good night, Dad.
Most nights
we went to sleep to the
sound of Dad's singing.
It wasn't really a lullaby.
But it was the closest
thing we had to one.
♪ Smelling that good
ol' mountain dew
♪ Smelling of that
good ol' mountain dew ♪
Your mom and me
are paying bills today.
Keep an eye on the squirt.
And stay out of trouble.
Whoo!
All right, guys!
All right! That was great!
Piece of crap, huh?
Well, this piece of crap
just kicked your ass, D.C.!
Yeah, well, no wonder
you won, Stouffer.
My truck outweighs this
stripped-down crap by
an easy 500 pounds.
You know what?
You're one sore loser, D.C.
You want to race fair? Huh?
Drag this behind your
car. That'll be fair.
With Zero on it.
Don't ever tell me what to do
with my little brother, D.C.
Marshall, get in the hood.
Whoo!
Let's cha-cha.

MARSHALThere was
something about them.
The way they moved,
the clothes they wore.
They were college girls.
Ooh. Is that
the Stewart sisters?
Yeah. They're back from
school for the summer.
Gosh, they've
really grown...
Up.
I saw that.
You saw what?
Let's do it!
Let's go again!
Like hell you'll go again.
Who won?
Yeah!
Are you all right?
You could have
killed him.
You're fine.
He's fine.
I'm fine, Marty.
You guys are great.
Yeah?
There's no way we'd see
guys doing stuff like
this at the university.
Damn, all boys there ever do
is study or throw footballs.
It takes an imaginative
guy to think of
something like this.
The kind of guy who'd consider
shooting out street lights
quality entertainment.
The kind of guy who'd risk
his little brother's life
for some stupid race.
Don't be an asshole, Marty.
You're right, Donna Jo.
It was stupid.
It's a dumb idea
all the way around.
Grow up.
And when you do,
give us a call.
Come on, Tanna.
You really think
you had a dumb idea?
Yeah.
That's cool, Marty.
Real cool.
I'm afraid to ask
what's on this one.
Mark...
I just got her in yesterday.
Wow.
That's no home
movie camera, boys.
That came from Channel Two
in Little Rock.
No kidding?
Yeah, ain't she a beaut?
Go on, have a look
through her.
Careful.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Bud.
What?
Nothing.
Mark, this could be it.
It could be what?
Our ticket out of here.
With this camera,
our stuff would be good
enough for TV, easy.
It takes more than a fast
car to win a race, Marty.
MARSHALOne look at it
and they wanted it more than
anything in the whole world.
I wanted to blow it up.
Thank God we
couldn't afford it.
We don't have that
kind of money, Agnes.
I'll bet the boys could
do a lot with a fine
camera like that.
See the world.
Film all kinds of things.
Why give them hope
in something that's
never gonna happen?
That's your own fault, Daddy.
Since they were little,
you kept banging it
into their heads,
"Be your own boss. Work hard."
Maybe nothing
will come of it,
but at least give
them a chance.
Chance to do what?
Throw hard-earned money
down the drain?
Give them a chance to
see what they can do.
I give them chances, Agnes.
Hell of a lot more
chances than I got
scraping this business
together from nothing.
I got inventory,
I got contacts.
This business
is their future.
It's what I worked
hard to give them.
Not a truckload
of false hopes.
It's not gonna happen, Agnes.
Then I'll give them
my Hawaii money.
You will not give them
your Hawaii money.
You've been saving
that money for years.
You will not give
it away in a day.
I talked to your
daddy last night.
What did he say?
He didn't.
I'll loan you
that money.
With interest.
Right now, I've got a truck
that needs unloading.
Dad, wait up!
I'll give you a hand.
It was
pretty cool-looking.
Real professional and serious.
And on account of that,
I thought they'd start making
movies about new things,
and forget about me.
Shh.
Forget it, it's a doe.
So what?
You hunt with us,
you hunt fair.
You're an asshole.
Finish her.
Do it!
Do it, D.C.
Hey, if you'd let me shoot
her when I had the shot,
none of this would
have happened.
Don't worry, Marty.
You did the right thing.
When
the film came back,
Marty told us it
wasn't exposed right.
We knew it wasn't true.
But none of us said anything.
You ever figured, if he
would have had a camera,
he would have filmed them
instead of shot them?
What?
Ernie-Bob Hemingway.
Ever figure that?
No. I never did.
What do you say, Leon?
Name one thing
uglier than these.
I can.
Clean hands
and empty pockets.
Hey, Dad.
Can I blow the air horn?
You can do it twice, squirt.
Coast to coast four times
without shutting her down.
Still good as new.
Coast to coast four times
without shutting her down.
Still good as new.
I need that trailer
loaded by tomorrow.
Kiss his ass good. Maybe
you can go instead of me.
Um, Dad?
Maybe I could
go this time.
I'm taking Marty.
Yeah, but...
Dad.
Mark can drive
as good as me.
When he's older.
You're the one that needs
to learn these runs.
Got to get
the hell out of here.
The whole time
I'm dipping carbs,
I'm thinking about
what you said, Marshall.
Can you believe that?
About Hemingway
killing animals.
I want to shoot them
with this instead.
Where would you go?
First...
Out there.
Then Africa.
What about Mark?
Mark's gonna do whatever
Mom and Dad want him to.
Hey, Mark.
Marty says he's
leaving town.
Mom and Dad know?
What?
Rare wildlife.
Birds and mammals.
You name it, huh?
There's so
many places to go.
You talked to your father?
Dad?
I've decided
I'm gonna move out.
Go on the road
and film animals.
Three quarters.
I figure
I'll sell the movies.
Make enough money
to pay off the camera
and then travel all over.
Well...
I just thought
you ought to know.
You're not going anywhere.
Yes, sir, I am.
No, you're not.
What'd you always
tell us, Dad?
Tell the truth. Work hard.
Don't be afraid of anything.
Make your own opportunities.
What'd you always tell us?
You always said, "If you want
to go out and sell something,
"it sure as hell better be
something nobody else has."
That's the way you
make your killing, Dad.
Animals...
Rare animals.
Who asked you?
I'm going too.
That's right.
Rare American animals.
People want to see them
before they're gone, Dad.
I mean, all kinds, right?
Eagles, snakes, fish,
whatever's getting killed off.
Beat it.
Dad, Mark's right.
People love animals.
And we can get them on film.
I mean, that
camera is a tool.
We need an hour of film
good enough to sell to TV.
We're not coming
back till we get it.
Mark's got 2 years
of school left.
That gives you
the rest of the summer.
Leaves me shorthanded.
Get out of here.
Yes, sir.
I say we go
for the badasses.
We film every endangered
badass in America
before there aren't
any left to film.
Here, check it out.
There's even a list.
"Top 10 most
endangered predators.
"Alligators, wolves,
grizzly bears."
I figure, screw
the fish, right?
I mean, who's
gonna pay money
to watch a humpback chub
or a short-nosed sturgeon?
We got to get
the shots everybody
else is afraid to get.
The dangerous ones.
Yeah, but Mom would kill
us before she'd let us
film a grizzly, right?
She doesn't need to know.
Well, if we're gonna film
one, we might as well
film a whole bunch, right?
I mean, what if we found
that cave of a thousand bears?
Nobody else has ever found it.
And if we do find it,
we'll be famous.
And this whole town can
kiss our royal butts.
Yeah. Yeah,
one cheek at a time!
That's right.
Marty.
Let's do a blood
brothers sort of thing.
Mark, we are blood brothers.
Well, I mean,
something so that,
you know, when we're out there
and start hating each other,
we'll know that we
don't actually hate
each other as much.
- Right? Huh?
- Okay.
Getting as close as we can
to every living thing
that swims in the water,
flies in the air,
or walks on the land.
Ahh!
To the cave.
The cave.
MARSHALOnly
an idiot would want
to have a ball of burning
metal rolling down his back.
But if they'd asked me,
I'd have done it in a second.
Where's Marshall?
Probably down at
the creek with Leona.
He's sad because he can't go.
Dad's not coming out, Mark.
Forget it.
It's not that
he doesn't care.
It's just that he's
worried about you boys
going off on your own.
You boys drive safe.
Don't want to wind up
in a fiery car wreck
in the middle of nowhere.
Be careful.
Love you.
Don't forget
your camera.
All right! Let's hit it.
Don't worry, Mom.
Say goodbye to the squirt.
Already did.
You look after each other.
- See you, Leon.
- See you.
Don't forget to call.
They'll be all right.
They're good boys.
See you later, suckers!
Whoo-hoo!
You'll be back in a week,
boy, cleaning my carburetor
and licking my boots.
Do you hear me!
We're free!
"Then the crazed mountain lion
dragged my screaming baby
out of camp.
"But when I finally
caught up...
"It'd already chewed
her little leg off.
"Blood was squirting
everywhere."
"I threw myself on
the beast
"and I started beating
with my fists and then
It turned on me.
"It sunk its teeth into
my ear and ripped it
away from my skull.
"I grabbed my ear but it
disappeared in one gulp
down its bloody throat.
"Then its claw punctured
my eyeball..."
Stop it!
I can't take it anymore!
Whoa!
But, Mom, I had to go.
Without even talking to us?
I've been
worried sick, Marshall.
Put Marty on.
AGNEWhere are you?
Uh, we're about 20 miles
outside of Cotulla.
We can put him on a bus.
Mom, you'd go if you were me!
You know you would!
Wouldn't you?
Let me talk to your brother.
I'm letting him stay.
Wherever you are in 2 weeks
put him back on a bus.
And Marty, in one piece.
All right, fine.
You're going to pay for this.
"The grizzly bear
toyed with me like
a broken, bloody doll,
"and started gnawing
my fingers off one by one.
"I tried to crawl away
but its jaws sank
into my leg
"and started dragging me
down the hill,
"tearing my flesh
over sharp rocks
and bushes.
"Suddenly the bear's
razor-sharp claws began
shredding at my back.
"The bear was on top of me,
its teeth crushing down
on my shoulder,
"shattering the bones.
I screamed.
"I could feel the bear's
hot breath on my neck
"as it began licking at
the blood gushing from
"my gaping wounds."
Cut it out, you guys.
What'd I ever do to you?
Guys.
Oh, shit! The camera!
It's locked.
Try the window.
Try the window.
Try that window.
Hey.
Marty, Marty, wait. Wait.
Damn.
I filled up the canteens.
Thank you.
Here.
Nope. Not thirsty.
MARSHALThis time,
we weren't taking any chances.
The sign said,
"Sightings guaranteed."
Y'all lose one piece
of my equipment,
you lose your deposit.
Better watch out for that
big ol' bastard out there.
Nighttime's when
he likes to feed.
Sucker ate my dog.
Ate him in one bite.
And he came after me.
I pulled my knife...
But he only got my leg.
How?
You know what makes them
the meanest animal alive?
The tail.
One solid muscle,
bigger than your whole body.
One whip of that thing
and that gator's
out the water
and its teeth are sunk in you
quicker than you can spit.
What do you say we go down
to New Orleans after, huh?
Have ourselves some fun.
Trip's not about fun, Mark.
Yeah, but it's not
not about fun either, is it?
Just get the bait ready.
We gotta get one of these
guys eating something,
otherwise it'll just
look like a log.
Okay, kill it.
I think I saw something move.
Throw the bait out there.
Oh, shit.
What? Just throw some more.
There isn't any more.
What?
You mean you threw
all the meat?
You just told me
to throw it.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
What're you doing?
Give me a hand here.
I don't know
about this.
Okay.
Easy now.
- Ah!
- Mark!
Scared you, didn't I?
Oh, brother.
- Mark.
- Marty?
Marty, I don't see him.
Come on! Come on!
Mark!
Marshall!
Toss me the knife! Quick!
Quick!
Guys, swim here!
I dropped
the flashlight.
Where's Marshall?
Oh, God.
Marshall, come on!
Swim faster!
Swim!
Let's go, Marshall!
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on, Marshall, now!
Swim, buddy!
Come on, give me your arm!
Well, we got
the flashlight back.
Thought for sure you fellas
would be the big guy's
supper tonight.
We almost were.
Well, you're lucky then,
because all of a sudden,
splash! Chomp!
My buddy Phil could tell you
a story all about that.
Please, mister,
no more stories.
Phil and me served in Korea.
Just fell in together.
Me telling stories about gator
hunting back home
and Phil telling tall tales
about bears.
What kind of tales
about bears?
Crazy things.
Like about a big cave
where a bunch of 'em
all sleep together.
Marty!
Did he say where
this cave was?
Out west all's I know.
Where can we find this Phil?
He's in the house.
In the house?
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on in. Phil!
Come on, boys.
My buddy Phil
came here a couple years back
looking for a pair
of gator skin boots.
Phil, man!
Where you be?
He right over here.
Phil just didn't get himself
a pair of gator skin boots.
What he got was
a whole dang gator skin suit!
Look,
the cave's real, Marty.
I know we can find it.
Mark, the guy was crazy.
Nothing wrong with
being a little crazy.
Hell, look at us, huh?
Are you with the circus?
Actually, we're filmmakers.
Hope you film better
than you juggle.
Sarah had an acting part once.
Really?
Miss Devonshire Cream, '66.
Paid her 50 quid.
Go on, show him.
Show me.
Devonshire Cream,
the creamiest cream.
They paid you for that?
It's not so easy. You try it
with a camera in your face
and a cow sniffing
around your bum.
Show me again.
I'm a professional.
I don't work for free.
I'll buy you a milkshake.
Get it to go.
Are you sure this
is a nude beach?
It is now. Turn around.

there's plenty of animals
in New York.
No, not the kind
we're after.

and further away.
It was like we were
three astronauts traveling
on another planet.
Devil's Playground.
Last home of the
wild American wolf.
Move over.
No, you move over.
Come on,
move over, Marty.
You move.
How come you always
get the shade?
Huh?
Everything you want,
you always get
and I get what's left, right?
I mean, whatever I wear,
you've already worn.
Whatever I do,
you've already done.
I'm tired of being
left behind.
Then why'd you
come along, Mark?
'Cause I didn't want
to be left behind.
And I wanted to have some fun.
I'm having fun.
Aren't you?
I'm having a blast.
Guys.
Oh, man.
Uh-oh, Marty.
Marty. Marty, look.
This is great.
Wow. Marty,
you getting this?
Cool.
What the hell?
This is great.

Go! Go, go, go, go!
Get in the car.
Get in the car!

Film it!
I'm filming,

Did you get it?
I got it.
Get it all?
Got it all. Got it all.
Leona?
Where's Marshall going?
Marshall,
what are you doing?
What's he doing, Marty?
I have no idea.
Guys.
Is that what I think
it is, Marty?
What've we got to write on?
Ma'am...
Do you know where we could
find this bear cave?
Could you be
a little more specific?
In the mountains of shadow...
Above the elk,
below the white valley,
beyond the peak of Arapaho
where the winter comes early.

it was a race between us

and nothing was going
to stop us from getting
there first.
So, what if a
whole bunch come?
They're endangered, Mark.
It means there aren't
a whole bunch.
If we even film three of 'em
in a cave, we've scored.
Scored? We'd be dead.
Yeah, and what, you're just
expecting them to come down
and lead us right back
to the cave, is that it?
You've got a better idea?
No.
The old woman said it was
in these mountains someplace.
She didn't say where.
What's that?
This?
This is bacon in
a skillet to a bear.
It's the sound
of a dying rabbit.
Bears can't resist it.
That's right.
You do it.
Do what?
Just do it.
I'm not doing it.
I'll do it.
If you give me the book.
Give it to him.
I wasn't stupid.
I knew they'd make me
do it anyway.
At least this way,
the stories would stop.
It's good!
Keep blowing!
Yeah.
This is the spot.
Okay. Set it up back up here.
Right there.
Marty, I don't see any bears.
They're coming.
I can feel it.
Yeah?
Keep blowing!
Hey.
Oh, wow! Marty.
Yeah, I see it, I see it.
Yeah? You getting it?
Hey, get a shot
with me and the baby deer!
See if you can get closer.
Marty, that's not a deer,
that's a moose, right?
Yeah.
Marty, moose
are dangerous, right?
I mean, shouldn't we get him
out of there?
Get outta there!
Marshall, get out of there!
No, you!
You're in the shot.
Marshall, get outta there!
Run! Run!
Hey, ya, ya, get outta there!
Marty!
Let's cha-cha.
Marty, help me!
Mark,
get out of the way!
Mark, Marty, help!
Mark,
get out of the way!
What!
Help!
Marty, forget the camera!
Marshall, jump off the moose!
Ah!
Marshall!
Help!
Help!
Marshall.
Mark, hurry!
Guys!
Help!
Bigfoot?
Guys!
You boys ain't from
around here, are you?
Thanks, mister.
Are you okay?
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm fine.
All right.
Who the hell are you?
I got it!
I've got it all on film.
It's dynamite, best yet.
Oh, come on, Marty.
What's wrong with you?
Our brother almost drowned.
I mean, he almost died.
You're okay,
aren't you, Marshall?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Who are you?
Oops.
Bears ain't dumb.
They're all fat and happy
and put up by now.
Exactly.
That's why it'll make it easy
when we find this cave.
Sneak up on them.
Sure, you will.
Go and walk on in and snap
a picture of a sleeping bear.
You do that,
and nobody's ever going
to see it, or you either.
Yeah, but it's there,
up in the mountains.
Big cave, a lot of
bears sleeping there at once.
No such thing.
Bears sleep alone.
No, it's real.
We're going to find it.
Let's say you do.
You ever seen a bear up close?
Hmm?
You never want to, especially
when they get waked up.
We're not scared.
Then you're stupid.
Out here chasing
some wild-eyed dream.
Supposing you
find that cave,
and you look at a bear
straight in the eye
and you want something.
And he looking you
straight in the eye
because he
wants something too.
You willing to pay the price?
Head on up
to Willing's Peak
and talk to old Carrie Stokes.
She'll tell you
about paying the price.
We're gonna
find that cave.
We're gonna film
those bears
and in time, mister,
you can see it on TV.
I ain't got no TV.
You want to keep him
two more weeks?
Believe me,
we'd send him home
if we wanted to.
It's just that he comes
in real handy sometimes.
"Handy"?
What do you mean
by "handy"?
Put your brother on.
Marshall, so you're having
a good time, you want to stay?
Yeah.
Are your brothers taking
good care of you?
Are you being careful?
Of course we're being careful.
"Safety first," Mom,
that's our motto.
All right.
Just call me
if you need me, okay?
I love you.
I love you too.
Bye.
We were two days
into the high country
and we hadn't seen
a living soul.
And when we did,
we wished we didn't.
Hello, anyone home?
Hello!
There's smoke
in the chimney.
Guys!
Go away.
I don't take visitors.
We're filmmakers.
We've, uh, come to film bears.
We heard there was a cave...
No caves around here.
We were told
you could help us.
I'm sorry.
Uh, Ma'am...
Look, we've come
a real long way.
And you're letting
the little one freeze.
Come in, warm him up,
and then you head
back down the hill.
I'll put some water on.
You guys see her face?
Yeah.
Whoever
convinced you
that this cave
full of bears
was something real
was just playing with you.
But you've heard of it?
No.
Bears sleep alone.
That was my...
My Judd.
He never came out
of the place I got this.
We were to be wed
on his birthday,
September 3rd.
Tomorrow.
I celebrate that day...
Alone,
every year,
by laying flowers
on his grave.
I'm sorry.
Take this.
Keep it.
It belonged to my Judd.
Thank you.
You go home.
You boys could
get hurt real bad
running around these mountains
chasing old bear stories.
Guys, she knows
where that cave is.
What makes
you think so?
I just know.
What about the film?
Screw the film, Marty.
Someone stole our food, money,
sleeping bags, everything.
Not everything.
Look, we can't
eat film, Marty.
We can't...we can't
sleep in it.
We are screwed.
Let's just call Mom.
She can send us some money.
No, there's no money to send.
We gotta rely on ourselves.
Now we got
Dad talking.
Hey, Dad can send us
some money.
Yeah, maybe he can fly it
over and drop it off.
Yeah, maybe he could.
That's right, Marshall,
maybe he could.
Dad's never flown
a plane in his life.
- Hey, cut it out, Marty.
- He was only a mechanic.
Scared to death
of heights, just like you.
I said leave him alone, Marty.
That's a lie.
Dad's flown lots of times.
Tell him, Mark.
Look, Marshall...
why don't you get in the car,
all right, buddy?
What's this?
You're Marshall's protector?
From asshole to angel?
I must have missed
the great transformation.
You know, you never
wanted to make this film
in the first place, Mark.
Why don't you go back
to the shop where you belong?
Grease monkey.
Ahh! My leg, Marty!
Marty. Marty.
Oh, Jesus, Mark,
I'm sorry.
It's okay. It's okay.
It's not your fault.
It's no big deal, Mom.
He just fell off a mountain.
Not a mountain.
It was a hill,
covered with snow.
The doctor
said you could
send in the money.
Yeah.
We're leaving
for home in the morning.
How's that feel?
Good.
You're lucky you only
got a hairline fracture.
You ever use crutches before?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, well, take it easy now.
All right.
Thank you.
Keep the weight off that foot
as much as you can.
Thanks a lot.
Sure.
Let's go, squirt.
Don't ever call me that again.
You boys have
a place to sleep tonight?
Yeah, we sleep
in the truck.
Like always.
You'll bunk here.
Don't want to be
eaten by a bear.
Wait, stop!
Stop the car?
What's today?
Who cares?
No, no, no, no, no.
It's Judd's birthday.
Carrie's husband.
So what?
So stop the car.
Turn around.
He was eaten
by bears, right?
Yeah, so?
So she said he never
came out of the place
that got attacked.
She's gonna take flowers
to his grave today.
She's going back
to the cave, guys.
We can follow her.
Carrie?
Flowers are gone.
Guys, horse tracks.
Let me see.
That horse
smells those bears.
Marshall, come on.
Oh, man, who farted?
The cave.
What's that?
Don't move.
Timber rattlers.
They're drawn in by heat.
How do we get over them?
I know.
All right.
Here.
Are you sure
this is safe, Marty?
Are you sure
this is gonna work?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Why don't you
go first to try it out?
Fine.
I'll do it.
Be careful, Marty.
Marty...
Ugh.
Ugh.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Snake bites you,
you scream,
the bears wake up,
and we all die.
You got it?
Let's go.
Watch where you're going.
Keep the light out front.
Jesus. Thanks.
How do we even know
they're back there?
They're there.
Sleeping like babies.
What's that?
It's just a boulder, Marshall.
It's okay.
Listen.
What is it?
Marty?
Marty, you know
what that sound is, huh?
Yeah.
I do.
I know what that sound is.
It's the sound of hundreds
of sleeping bears
ready to wake up
and tear our faces off.
There they are.
This is it.
They're all here.
Marty.
Marty, we found it.
Oh, my God...
They're everywhere.
Oh, shit.
They're all around us.
What do we do?
Oh.
Oh, God.
Marty. Marty!
They're all around us.
Marshall.
Yeah?
Give me the flashlight.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Mark.
Shine the flashlight
down here.
Take that, and that,
and take that.
I'm gonna
count to three.
That's when we do it.
Ready?
Okay.
One...
Two...
Three.
This is great.
Jackpot.
Marty, we gotta
get the hell out of here.
What, are you crazy?
♪ My Uncle Bill's
got a still on the hill
♪ Good ol' mountain dew
♪ And the buzzards in the sky
Get so dizzy they can't fly
♪ Just smelling of that
good ol' mountain dew
Don't stop singing.
♪ They call it
that ol' mountain dew
Lord, Lord
♪ And them that

Marty...
Marty, it worked.
Way to go, Marshall.
Guys...
Let's get the hell
out of here.
Bat shit.
They're waking up!
Come on, Marty!
- Guys...
- Ahh!
Get back!
- Get back! Ahh!
- Guys!
Get back!
There you go!
Go get it!
Oh, shit.
Marty!
My camera!
You guys go,
I got a way out!
Where is the snow?
We just left him.
He said he had a way out.
Marty, It's Marshall! Look!
All right, Marshall!
Stay right there!
You okay?
I got the camera.
Screw the camera.
You sure you're okay?
You little shit.
Huh? You all right?
MARSHALI rode up front
all the way home.
At last, the wheel was mine.
Green is go.
Tachometer, 1,000.
Air speed, 20 knots.
Flaps to the second notch.
The brakes!
Nice driving. Zero.
MARSHALOne minute,
I save them from getting torn
to shreds by raging bears.
Two mailboxes
and one sign later,
I'm back to "Zero."
At least it's not raining.
MARSHALIf there was a way
home without passing
the Dairy Grand,
I'm sure
Dad would've taken it.
But there wasn't.
Hey, look who's back
with his tail
between his legs!
Hey, Stouffer!
Just in time
for my oil change.
You find any dodos?
Ignore them, Marty.
They're a bunch of idiots.
I want that truck
dropped and in the shed
before you go to sleep.
Trouble's back.
Hi, Mom.
Is your leg all right?
It's broken.
Marshall.
All right, Mom. All right.
We'll pay you back.
You'll work it off.
Now that you got that
out of your system.
I got some hot apple pie.
Mom, Mom, I'll be right back,
I promise.
Leona!
She got strong enough
to fly away.
She was a wild bird, honey.
She didn't belong here.
Leona.
Leona.
If Dad was never
going to fly with me,
why would he name it...
Zero.
I'm hauling a load
up to Rochester.
You boys got plenty
to keep you busy.
You ought to take
Mark with you.
He's the one
you'll be leaving
this gold mine to.
Since when are you
too good for what
we do for a living, Marty?
Because if you're too good
for this business,
you're too good
for the money it made.
Too good for the house
you grew up in,
the clothes on your back,
the food in your belly
and your new,
busted camera.
You too good
for all that, son?
Dad.
What?
You ever fly a plane?
Did you ever fly a plane?
I've done
the best I could
by you boys.
If it wasn't good enough,
it's the best I know how.
Go ahead, open it.
It's for all of you.
What is it?
Just open it.
Bud said the film would
be ready Thursday night.
- Mom...
- What's this?
Keys to the school gym.
I rented it for Friday night.
We didn't get enough,
it's never going to make
a real show.
Just look at it.
If you like what you see,
show it.
If not...
We'll play basketball.
Guys.
What about the truck?
Totaled.
The load?
Destroyed.
There was a fire.
They were lucky
to get you out alive.
Thank God
nobody else was hurt.
Tell Leon you want
the connecting rods.
They're in the back shed.
I saved them for a rainy day.
With the doctor bills
and everything,
it'll be raining pretty good.
A guy in Pittsburgh
will give you
six bits a piece for them
if they're put together.
Marty...
Agnes, I saved parts,
not cash.
We're gonna need
some money.
Come on, boys.
You father needs his rest.
Bye, Dad.
Marty, stick around.
I'm counting on you, son.
This could break us.
These are older.
Might take a little more
elbow grease.
Lots of folks coming
to the big show tomorrow.
Oh, yeah?
I'm not gonna be there.
What do you mean,
you're not gonna be there?
What's the point?
We don't even have a film.
Got a bunch of little pieces.
You want to go make a fool
out of yourself, be my guest.
You know, I'll just...
I'd rather stay here in jail,
pounding rocks
for the rest of my life.
This isn't easy
for me either.
You know what the great thing
about these rods is?
They don't chase you.
No, I mean it.
I mean, look at 'em.
They just sit there.
Maybe we should've made a film
about these. Rods and Carbs.
At least it'd be in focus,
not like that wolf you shot.
It was in focus.
Oh, yeah, well, maybe
you got lucky with the wolf,
but what about that moose
and that alligator?
Huh, Marty? What about them?
What about 'em?
Those are great shots.
Maybe we should just stick
to what we know
and that's dipping carbs.
That's crap.
We know film, we know cameras,
we know animals.
Oh, yeah? Where's that going
to get us in life, Marty?
Huh? Where?
Nowhere.
You know, you're right, Marty.
Film's just a big loser,
anyway.
The film's gonna be great!
He'll be there.
I hope so.
To this day,
I don't know if it was
the wind, or Leona...
But somehow,
I knew what I had to do.
Everyone has dreams.
But life has a way of making
us forget what they are.
I wasn't going
to let that happen to us.
Not to their dreams...
Or mine.
All right.
Mixture...
Full rich.
Contact.
Marty! Marty!
Get up! Get up!
Oh, my God!
Ease the throttle forward.
Flaps to the second notch.
Oh, my God.
Marshall!
Green is go.
Is Marshall up?
Not yet.
What's going on?
Marshall!
Marshall!
Don't take off!
It's okay, Leon's got him.
Please, don't take off!
Marshall, stop right now!
I gotta do this, Leon.
Get in the car!
Get in the car!
Marshall, what are you doing?
Flying, Leon!
Well, fly higher!
Not this high!
Your daddy'd sure love
to see this.
He's going to.
What's wrong?
What's wrong?
Leon, fly her!
I don't know how!
Just keep the stick
from moving!
Mark, take the wheel.
Got it.
I don't see him!
Oh, my God! He fell out!
Oh, God.
You're right.
I mean, you're right.
I don't see him.
I see Marshall.
I think he's laughing.
He is! He's laughing!
Leon too!
No.
Leon's screaming.
Marshall, get me down!
I'm going to throw up!
Tell me when we're home!
What the hell is he doing?
He's talking to Dad.
I think he's talking
to all of us.
Hey, Leon, did you see
the look on my dad's face?
Hey, Leon, did you...
Maybe because
I had dreamed it so much,
I wasn't afraid.
Or maybe because
Dad was with me.
I don't know.
But I do know, like Dad said,
we sliced through the clouds
just like butter.
Wake up, Leon.
We're heading home.
Good morning, everybody.
Y'all just thought you'd
take her out for a spin?
Yup.
Why?
Had to.
Is that it?
Yup.
Get down here.
What do you think
your father's gonna say?
Probably, "How's she handle?"
I hope.
Mom, I want to go in alone.
Given the choice...
I'd take the bear cave.
Dad,
I think you got some
explaining to do.
It's really quiet.
That's because he's dead.
Dad killed him.
You plan on growing old
with us?
'Cause I doubt
this family's going
to stay together
if you don't start letting
each of us be
who we need to be.
"Work hard, tell the truth.
"Don't be afraid of anything."
Isn't that right, dad?
Why'd you let me believe
we were gonna fly together?
You know
what a white lie is, Dad?
It's when you say something
instead of the truth
so no one gets hurt.
Well, a lie's a lie.
And they hurt everybody,
including you,
whether you know it or not.
I'm not going to be in this
hospital bed forever, son.
What then?
My guess? I'll probably
go one on one with the belt.
But that's later.
What I'm asking you
now is for you to cut
Mark and Marty loose.
Don't squash
their dreams, Dad.
Let them go make films.
You telling me
what to do, son?
No, Dad.
I'm asking you.
So, Marshall...
How'd she handle?
Until just now,
I never told anybody
what happened that day
between Dad and me.
Don't think
they would've believed me.
Just like
they wouldn't believe
what happened later that night
if they hadn't been there
themselves.
Some people liked it.
Some people didn't.
It's baby crap, man.
It isn't scary.
MARSHALSome didn't care
much either way.
Stouffer.
You should've paid us
to sit through
this piece of crap, man.
Boo!
Congratulations, son.
I'm real proud of you boys.
Thanks, Dad.
Stouffer, we want
our money back, man.
You saw a pretty damn good
show for your money, son.
But here.
My treat.
You guys are great.
I'm sure you got more
important things to do
than to watch silly movies
about dumb animals.
After all, when it comes
to dumb animals,
nobody knows more
about that than you, D.C.
College girls.
Move!
We thought it was good.
A little short, but damn good.
It was brilliant.
We're going to finish
the film, maybe sell it to TV.
Maybe we'll get someone famous
to narrate it.
Yeah. Yeah,
someone like Robert Redford.
Oh, groovy.
Marshall,
you were so great.
Can we have your autograph?
I need a vacation.
MARSHALAnother wonderful
thing happened that night.
Dad smiled.
No one in that gym
could've known it then,
but on April 6th, 1977,
The Predators
aired on NBC,
narrated by Robert Redford.
