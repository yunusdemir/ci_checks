Amidst the thunder
of horses' hooves,
the shouts of the
drovers and a cloud of dust
I flew into the small
town of Far-Khor.
Please forgive me
for visiting you so rarely,
and I'll tell you everything? Mother.
Well,
Soon I'll make anough money,
so I can study to be an actress.
Father says we haven't
enough money.
He started farming rabbits,
fat and fluffy.
Nasreddin is doing better.
He can already remember 33 words.
Nasreddin...
Nasreddin... mother...
I like this girl.
Her name is Mamlakat.
Soon something will
happen to her.
She'll become my mama.
The pills!
Fumigation!
Land, idiot!
Where did he go?
Sorry.
Evil!
Everywhere evil.
- No...
Feel sick.
- Calm down.
Calm down.
- Hurts.
Sorry.
It's a car.
I'm a car.
- No.
You are Nasreddin.
- No. I'm a car. Get in.
I'm a passenger.
Mamlakat, come to rehearsal!
- I can't. I'm looking after Nasreddin.
Mamlakat!
Nasreddin, Sube is calling us.
Let's help her.
Mamlakat, can you arrange these,
I've got more to make.
Salaam.
Here's your ice.
Put it in the kitchen.
- Do it yourself.
Lout!
Dumpling!
Evil.
Look, there is a fish in the ice.
Nasreddin,
this is ice.
Say: 'ice'.
Ice.
- Ice... ice...
That's a fish.
Fish...
- Fish alive.
Why do you bother explaining?
Do you think he understands?
Everything's alive to him.
You're a strange family-all mad.
And especially him.
And yesterday your father...
How many times have I told you?
Keep your hands to yourself.
Actors are coming today,
and just look at my lip!
Now what?
Close your eyes.
Open them.
Close them.
Open them.
Rudolf Pirumov!
Alive...
I would give everything.
All my money.
Even more.
What?
- Myself.
I would shut my eyes,
open my legs and...
Me too.
What?
- Shut my eyes.
Give it a rest!
What's wrong with Nasreddin?
- Nothing.
What's with him?
Get in.
Let's go sell rabbits in Kurgan.
All set?
Crazy.
It's the actors.
I must get back in time.
- What is my heart made of?
Of love for Nasreddin and Mamlakat/
But actors will be on stage...
Your love for actors is beyond me.
Powder, lipstick-yuck!
It's not for you!
It's not the powder or the lipstick,
they're performing Shakespeare.
- Shakespeare!
Adelaide!
Revolver!
Authorisation!
Why so many rabbits?
- I farm them.
You eat them all yourself?
- I sell them.
You have too many.
Normal amount.
We're not talking elephants.
A joker.
Don't.
Are you a moron?
- You're the moron!
Why be so rude?
Take her into the tank!
Do a full check!
Tell your jackals
to clear out.
Stay where you are!
You called Nasreddin a moron,
yet he was a...
soldier...
who saw active duty.
Blew up on a mine.
We were lucky they
managed to sew him back together.
Where the hell are we going?
- To sell rabbits.
To hell with your rabbits!
It's expensive to take
care of a moron,
you hear me?
Papa, stop it!
- I'm speaking their language.
Fuck their language.
Don't call Nasreddin a moron!
Get out!
Now take a walk.
If you want to find me,
I take these roads a lot.
And I live in Far-Khor.
What is the number on the lorry?
Well?
- I think it is 007.
Great! Turn right!
Attention, passengers,
emergency landing.
Keep giving gas!
I have an urgent delivery.
We're on tour.
We'll be late for performance.
- In Far-Khor.
I saw his lorry so
I knew he wasn't in.
Let's lie together, my love.
- Wait. - I'll take you to heaven.
Give me number twelve.
No, number twelve.
I'll be late for the play.
You and your play!
Salaam aleikum. How are you doing?
Salaam aleikum.
- Perfect for your girl.
Look at the fabric, the workmanship!
I won't charge much,
only 140 roubles.
No. We need
money for Nasreddin.
Try it on.
Here's something for you.
This is what's in now.
It'll look good on you.
How much?
- 140 roubles.
Circus!
Will you give my daughter
a lift to Far-Khor?
Of course, it's on our way.
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high...
- Stop the racket. Go home!
I'm so fed up.
Thou art so pure, so pure...
Of other people's hands...
- Brilliant...
Your acting is brilliant.
Who's there?
I am...
An actor,
a 27-year-old actor.
Actor?
Please tell me about Rudolf Pirumov.
I absolutely love him,
he's my favorite actor.
And also Top Cruise.
Do you like Top Cruise?
Good old Tok!
Once, after a play...
- Where are you?
He shook my hand
for a whole 5 minutes.
I can't see you.
- And he wept.
Careful, it's dark here.
Aren't you scared?
I know my way.
But you be careful, it drops off here.
Where are you?
- Here.
You were on stage all night,
you must be tired.
Yes, it was hard work.
I think you have talent.
Really?
Shall I recite something?
- I'd be delighted.
Be careful.
It gets steep here.
We should wait for the moon
There'll be more light,
and we'll be able to go...
I am your opponent.
You're the second horseman.
First, test my strength with
your right hand.
Ready, set, go...
And now from below...
Mamlakat is not good.
There you are. Isn't it weird?
As a result of some peculiar
laws of biology,
chemistry and something else,
the drops of my mother
and of the stranger mixed...
and created me,
Khabibulla.
Nestled deep within my
mother's womb,
soft as rabbit's fur,
I feel the warm caress
of her breathing,
hear the beating of her heart.
And I begin to get to know her.
What's his name?
- He didn't say.
If I'd made it to the theatre,
I would have seen him.
Papa bought me a new dress.
It was white and flowing.
As if he'd known
that I was going to meet him.
Why aren't you wearing it then?
- It's got blood on it.
Blood?
Where?
He and I went all the way.
All the way?
Fool!
Yes!
Stop crying!
Are you sure it happened?
I exploded
like an atomic bomb.
Does it hurt?
- No.
I slid down.
And there I lay as if I were dead,
and he kissed me from head to toe.
He was so gentle.
Then you saw him?
- No, I only heard him.
And then I woke up,
and he said:
"We shall fly tonight".
They're still here.
Yes. I saw the plane at the airport.
Yes.
Stop! Stop!
What's the big idea?
You can't go there, girls.
Please welcome the
'Harvest' ensemble.
My mother likes dancing and singing
in the 'Harvest' ensemble.
I like rocking about
in my mother's quiet waters.
I'm growing.
She still doesn't know that I'm here.
The 'Harvest' ensemble!
What a beauty. Here.
Fish alive.
- I think we'll take this one too.
Or what about this one?
Are you alright?
- Alive.
Shoo!
Have you had your period?
- Not for two months.
You're going to have a baby.
- No. - Yes.
Are you alright, Mamlakat?
Fish is flying.
It happens.
These two cows are
my present to you.
How much milk do they produce?
- Enough for two.
My daughter is only seventeen.
I don't understand you.
Look at this groom.
Is he your son?
Your son?
- Yes.
Let's test him.
- Let's see...
He needs to get stronger.
Take your son and beat it.
You don't know who
you're dealing with.
I'm the man in Far-Khor.
This round's on me.
- What are you doing?
Here is money.
It was dark.
Suddenly I heard footsteps. - Whose?
I don't remember.
I only remember the voice.
Voice?
- It was so tender.
Doctor, I'm going to have a baby.
- From the footsteps? - No.
From the voice.
Doctor, I need an abortion.
- It's very painful. - Painful?
It's like taking your ear
and twisting it.
Is that what you want?
If my father finds out
I'm pregnant...
Go lie down.
Go lie down.
- Over there? - Yes.
O'kay.
I'll just have a soda first,
then I'll give you your abortion.
What else is there to do, Mariam?
Give me one with syrup
and one without.
How's business?
- Not too bad.
Don't kill the doctor!
- Hit the dirt!
Where are you shooting?
Did he want it
with or without syrup?
Doctor, are you alright?
Tell your friend
to keep the child.
Mariam,
raspberry syrup,
rasp...
The poor gynaecologist.
Killed by a stray bullet.
But I'm glad.
It was my only chance of salvation.
Forgive me, doctor.
What an unlucky day.
So many bad things happened.
What are you going to do now?
Are you listening? I'm talking to you.
What will you
tell your father?
And what will the
people in town say?
Why are you shrugging?
Are you paying attention?
Do you understand what this means?
How are you going to walk around
town with such a belly?
Maybe it will be alright.
Papa, there's something I
have to tell you.
But don't explode as usual.
What happened, my dear girl?
Did you break another cup?
First let me tie up your legs.
- Alright.
Don't move.
Is it Nasreddin again?
Now your hands.
I bet it's something interesting.
You lost the lottery ticket?
This time...
I have a little boy or girl sitting
in my tummy.
Who is sitting where?
I am pregnant.
Easy.
Just don't explode as usual.
Keep calm.
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Where is my daughter?
Nasreddin!
Mamlakat, come get your brother.
Everything... bad.
- Calm down.
Please forgive me.
It was dark, I fell, I didn't mean to.
Forgive me, my love.
Nasreddin is sick,
Mamlakat is pregnant.
I don't know.
Such trouble.
Why did you leave us so early?
Why can't I join you?
I just want to be with you.
We'll go to every theatre.
You'll recognise the bastard.
He is not a bastard.
All Far-Khor will find out
that the child has no father.
It's terrible.
It's shameful.
Safar Bekhmuradov's daughter
gives birth
to the child of an unknown father!
Such a thing
has never happened in our family.
I ought to shoot myself.
Salaam aleikum, Safar.
Hold on!
He's got nothing to do with it.
He is just a theatre director.
It's not his fault.
I've got nothing to do with it.
- Hold your head straight!
Hold your head straight!
- There were 4 women and 4 men.
I don't need the women.
He loves the theatre.
- To hell with your theatre!
I promise you...
- Give me the list of the actors.
We're going to Samarkand
- to the theatre.
Remember the name Oripov.
Oh! I'm slain.
I am maim'd forever.
Help! Murder! Murder!
When will this end?
Shakespeare is forever.
How much longer?
What do you mean, shhh?
I'm so fed up with this
Othello-Mothello.
Is it him or not?
- His face is black.
Wake up that asshole!
Why are you drinking over there?
He's been snoring all bloody day.
Who am I strangling Desdemona for?
War! - War?
Call the manager, the director!
It's the end.
Who are you? What do you want?
Is it him?
- I don't know.
Don't know... Turn around.
Take a good look. Is it him?
No, it's not him.
- No, I'm not him.
You!
You! Follow me!
One, two, three.
Here goes!
Name? - Saidov.
Salaam aleikum.
- Is it him?
It's not him either.
Nasreddin?
- He's asleep.
This is not the time to sleep!
He doesn't sleep at home,
he sleeps on the road.
Terrible habits.
I just don't understand it.
What are you meddling with?
I want to help.
You've already helped me enough.
Go and fetch some water.
Wait.
Forget it.
Remember to buy aspirin -
my head is killing me.
Help the poor!
Dear friends!
Friends!
Comrades!
We pay 5 dollars, real dollars.
Think of those who need your help.
Donate your blood! Come on!
Act now, Kolchosniki!
Hello.
What do you want?
Can I give extra blood?
I can take it, I'm strong.
Let's go. Alfia,
get things ready.
Do you pay immediately?
- By post. - Forget it.
But for you we might
make an exception.
I need a lot.
Think about it.
Your blood will be circulating
around the globe.
Do you like travelling?
Very much.
I want to go far away.
Just don't get lost.
The police! Let's get out of here.
Selim, get moving!
Why are they chasing us?
They don't like us
because we help people.
They don't let us buy blood.
Selim, drive carefully!
It's a romantic moment.
I thought you really hurt yourself.
It's my father. Stop the bus!
What father? - He's worried.
- How old are you?
Almost eighteen.
Stop the bus!
What? - Eighteen.
- Did you hear that, Selim?
Idiot!
What's your name? Come here!
What?
Give this to your father. Tell him
thank you from the Red Cross.
What for?
- Go!
Get moving!
Thank you, doctor.
Good, keep pushing!
Keep the tail-wheel straight!
Good.
Abu, you're in charge!
What happened? - We've run
out of petrol. Do you have any?
Yes, one canister.
Don't you sing in the 'Fruit
and Vegetable' Ensemble?
The 'Harvest' Ensemble.
Wrap your scarf around your neck.
You may catch a cold
and lose your voice.
Who's screaming?
A woman is having a baby.
- A baby?
It's been a crazy day...
- Actor!
No, he's the pilot.
- I'm a pilot.
Here's the petrol.
He's a little...
Dump it in!
Everybody into the plane!
Quick!
We're taking off.
Welcome, come in.
You can't just walk in.
You need a ticket or an invitation.
We are sold out.
There's nothing I can do.
I need to see a ticket
or an invitation.
Is Oripov performing tonight?
- Yes, he is.
And I need a ticket?
- Either a ticket or an invitation.
If life is precious to you, Oedipus,
I beseech you, do not ask!
My suffering is enough.
Be brave!
I beg you, please!
It was predicted that you, Oedipus,
will kill your father.
Oh, gods!
Oh, light!
This is the last time that I will
see you. Born in damnation,
I'm damned in marriage,
innocent blood is on my hands.
Oedipus!
Piggy ears!
- Piggy ears!
Who said that?
Who said 'piggy ears'?
Who?
Come down on stage!
I'll show you, motherfucker!
Take him away!
Oh, woe is me!
Was that him?
With the makeup and powder?
Was that him?
King Oedipus?
In our list he's called Javadov.
No, he's...
He's like a woman.
I wouldn't want you
to have a husband like him.
Where is it? Let's go!
Bad?
- Bad. I'm sorry.
Idiots!
What room number is this?
413.
- And what did I tell you?
313.
Get out of here! Idiots!
You can't do anything right.
You half killed them.
Terribly sorry.
Good night.
Are you hurt?
Will you go into labour
soon, sweetheart?
Soon.
Nasreddin has no medicine.
You have no husband. Disaster.
Good thing
that rabbits keep multiplying
and multiplying.
Wake up.
Stop tickling me.
Do you want to see your mama?
That's the third window
they've broken.
Sorry.
Customers have stopped coming.
My father scolds.
We have no money.
Feel it!
We have to sell the tea house!
We've been going round theatres
but can't find him.
Nasreddin is getting much better.
Mama, it's a shame you
are not with us.
You would look at me...
and be so happy.
Well...
There's much work to do,
the fish,
the rabbits...
But nobody will buy them.
Hussy!
Whore!
It's my fault.
It's my fault.
Please forgive me.
It hurts me.
But it's even worse for mama.
I'd take all the blame if it
would make things easier for her.
Did you swallow a watermelon?
Watermelon, watermelon...
How's the little tart
who does it with everyone?
Let's go!
My dear daughter.
Get out of the way!
Old witch!
I'll show you!
Papa,
in town they say...
- So they talk.
In town they say...
Safar Bekmuradov's
daughter is a prostitute.
Whatever they say,
the child should be born.
Do you hear me?
We just have to find the father.
He's got to be somewhere.
But where?
How do you recognise an actor?
Lipstick,
make-up...
The singer Ali Khamrayev.
He is the fourth on the list.
Shee-eep!
Shee-eep!
Here they are.
Here they are, Abu!
Lower!
We'll crash.
I can't see anything.
This is the fifth one.
Want one more?
Enough!
Where were you?
Mamlakat, this is the fourth one.
Is it him?
Salaam aleikum.
That's the famous
singer Ali Khamrayev.
Don't you ever watch television?
Nasreddin.
- Papa?
Who did you catch?
Khamrayev. - See?
You don't watch television.
You don't appreciate art.
Gangsters!
Get out of my house!
Good bye.
We'll miss you.
Where is number six?
Doctor!
You stinking rats!
I'll get you, you lousy bastards!
What are you doing to the doctor?
Stop! What are you doing?
It's not the money. We warned you!
You broke your word.
Get rid of this bitch!
Please don't kill him.
Why are you crying?
I'm his wife.
And he is my husband.
You mean this bastard is married?
- Yes.
We're going to Moscow
for our honeymoon.
And to have our baby.
A boy? - A boy.
Did you have a scan?
Yes, everything.
Grandma Aziza, Tursunali,
and everyone, all say it'll be a boy.
Open the door!
Let God decide.
Pull the emergency brake!
Doctor.
Doctor, your shoe.
What's wrong, beautiful?
Did you get scared?
No need.
I'm still alive.
It's not that easy to kill me.
I'm good at playing cards,
and the idiots
want me to pay them.
Percentage.
Shit!
By the way, you saved my life.
You took my blood.
Remember?
When is the train?
- The next one?
I don't know.
Do you have a ticket?
There!
Girl!
Little boy, little boy.
Be patient. Don't come out yet.
There's nothing here. It's a desert.
People will say,
you were premature,
born under a bush.
Clever boy!
Do it like all children in a hospital,
with mama in clean sheets,
surrounded by doctors in
snow-white coats,
in the city.
Father will be waiting outside
pacing nervously...
He doesn't have a father.
- He'll have one.
Fool!
I'm his father.
I'll be his father.
Why did you stop before Far-Khor?
- I owe money there.
Is this a dream?
No, it's not.
- Mama fell in love with Alik.
She whispers to me:
"I'm pure now and I'm
no longer afraid".
We have a papa.
Well, mother, he's not the one...
It's Alik from Bukhara.
May I introduce,
the doctor.
He saved me,
and he'll make everything okay.
Shall we go?
Let's go.
Let's go.
Don't worry. I told you
I'll take care of everything.
You haven't met my father yet.
I found him.
Who is he?
The actor.
Salaam aleikum.
You'll pay me back for the petrol.
Far-Khor - Samarkand, Far-Khor
- Bukhara, Far-Khor - Tashkent.
Get up!
Why didn't you come yourself?
I like you, son.
Give him some food.
You have to excuse this old man.
I haven't slept
for the last seven months.
You should quit
this acting business.
I quit.
Do you snore?
I used to.
Go then!
Nasreddin!
You shouldn't run like that.
- That's my brother.
Fly! Fly away!
Bastard!
You have a bastard in your belly.
I'll take you apart.
Let me go! Alik!
Stop!
Piss off!
Let her go!
It was so dark.
I found him.
That's him.
- Who?
My brother.
See the aeroplane?
No time.
He'll come back.
Thank you.
Come again.
Alik!
Fumigation!
What's up?
- Will you really marry me?
Why?
I promised and I stick to my word.
You probably say that to all the girls,
but I'm a pregnant woman.
I always liked pregnant women
and now I found one.
I don't believe you.
You haven't even proposed properly.
Clever girl.
What happened to him?
- Electric shock.
Don't cry! He'll be fine.
There's still some electricity in him.
We have to bury him.
Please go! Please go!
Everything is fine.
You just got electrocuted.
Everything will be okay.
What's your name?
Mamlakat.
You are Alik. Do you remember?
Why did you climb up there?
I wanted
to pick a flower and to offer
you my hand and my heart.
It's so easy to pick a flower.
Mamlakat,
I really want to marry you.
I want to live a long life with you
and have many children.
And where will our big family live?
I have no home.
- Why not?
Ever since my father disappeared,
I've been on my own.
My mother died when I was born.
Is that so? Come here.
Don't cry.
Everything will be fine. Okay?
Bad... Mamlakat...
wedding... afterwards.
You see,
I love her.
Just as you
can't live without the sun,
I can't live without her.
You understand?
I'm going to her, okay?
Go!
No, we can't.
You mustn't...
- Play cards again.
No, you shouldn't...
- Steal either.
No, we mustn't...
- Wake your father.
Again?
Your father will have to mend it.
My boy,
you've got much smarter.
Who are you bombing?
- Much evil!
Where?
Your sister is getting married today.
- So what?
I'm fed up.
Why do you always
have to fight evil at the wrong time?
Papa!
Alik!
Calm down.
Papa is gone.
Alik is gone.
He drowned and...
flew away.
Calm down.
Welcome!
I've brought a rock band.
- I wanted the Philharmonic.
Same thing. Abu!
Prepare for the flight to Istanbul!
Fry this fish, girl.
And what about the passengers?
They applauded.
Are you telling
the Boeing story again?
You couldn't even tie up your cows.
Let's hear your story.
Not long ago we had
two cows and a bull on board...
Why?
People have nothing to eat.
And it pays well.
All these cultural events: Opera,
symphony orchestra,
that kind of thing.
Anyway, he didn't tie up the bull.
The plane takes off, crosswind.
And the bull is getting
knocked all around the plane.
I pull the control
wheel in as far as it goes...
His horns go through the porthole.
I think we are going to crash.
- What happened to the bull?
I had to push it out.
- It flew like an angel.
That's a story!
And you talk about your Boeing...
Mamlakat.
Where are you going?
A relative of mine lives here.
What about the
order to Istanbul?
Fly on your own.
- On my own?
There are many Istanbuls,
but only one life.
Forgive me.
You can punish me
any way you like.
Sit there!
I didn't...
recognize you. You've changed.
A lot.
I can't remember.
Girl, it's me.
I mean, I'm him.
- Who?
The actor...
who pulled you down in the bushes.
Are you crazy, pilot?
- You don't believe me?
I can tell you
what you did that night.
You were late for the play.
I came up to you and said:
"Tok, good old Tok!
"He shook my hand a long time
"and wept."
Do you believe me now?
Hello.
A rabbit is running loose.
- I'll catch it.
What are you doing?
It's me...
I'll kill you.
- Don't pull the trigger again!
Why not?
The child will have my name.
Bulotchkin.
I'll marry you
and take you away from this hole.
They...
They are giving me a jet.
A jet?
A jet.
Get on the table.
What for?
Go on!
Go on!
What do you want from me?
I don't know. Sorry.
I want you to fall into
a hole and disappear.
Evil.
Hold this.
I'm so nervous.
Where are the pickles?
Like this.
You haven't forgotten how to shoot?
Hi!
Easy there. We are both men.
Let's discuss this calmly.
I'll marry Mamlakat.
I'm the father of her child.
Alik.
I'm coming down
to give you a hug.
We are brothers now.
- Move!
We are brothers now.
- Evil.
There!
Stop it, deaf and dumb!
Are you playing hunter?
Give it to me.
Idiots! I'll jump down
and make mincemeat of you.
Jump!
Out of sheer terror
the pilot fell asleep.
He doesn't eat, nor drink.
Nasreddin carries him to the toilet.
I have no use for such a father.
Now that he is in our house,
the townspeople
are nastier than ever to us.
Impatiently I awaited the day
when mama and Nasreddin
decided to take him to the city.
We'll put him on a train,
and that will be that.
We never
invited him to stay with us.
Or we'll put him on a steamer.
They'll wake him up in the hospital.
Is he the father of your child?
- Yes.
Then you must marry him.
But he is asleep.
A child must have a father.
The law requires it.
The law?
I don't love him.
It's not important
whether you love him or not.
They must be wed and that's
all there is to it.
You take him!
No more special treatment for you
Bekhmuradovs.
Run!
Onto the roof!
Together!
- I know... Climb!
Fly!
Fly!
It's a shame you haven't met me.
We must go away from here.
Uncle Nasreddin is staying behind
to fight evil.
Mama and I are flying away.
From the scowling of closed hearts,
from human evil.
Farewell.
For me it is time
to come into the world.
