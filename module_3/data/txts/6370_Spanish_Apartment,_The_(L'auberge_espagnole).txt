Everything has started there,
with taking off.
No, it is not a story of a plane which is taking off.
Yes, it rather goes like this.
I had an appointment with
Jean-Charles Perrin.
It starts where it has to
end: here.
I have an appointment with
mr Jean-Charles Perrin.
You can find him in building F
Stage 6, office 602.
Sir?
- Good morning. I have an appointment
with mr Jean-Charles Perrin.
A visitor for mr Perrin.
Good Morning.
I have an appointment
with mr Jean-Charles Perrin.
Fine, please follow me.
Hi... Xavier!
Good morning, Mr Perrin.
- Call me Jean-Charles.
This is really good.
Please come in.
I work here.
Young talent.
View on Paris.
There you have the Sacré Coeur.
The Eiffel tower.
and Jussieu ofcourse.
Beautiful.
- Whole Parijs.
I know your father from before...
We studied together at the ENA.
At that time it was still located in Paris.
I still remember. It dates from...
Oldfirst is being dumped by Moodis...
My father is someone who understands this.
...while ADR Allied Irish crashes.
Visit him.
It will lose you nothing.
He's quite nice. I know him already...
So this is my father.
It is entirely your area.
Do you like a double beer?
Do you know Donohugue?
Scottish. A real pearl.
Everything has started
when he said this.
I can only say that new jobs will
be available next year
because of the new European directives.
I can fix you a job if you do a paper
about something that concerns the Spanish economy.
They need people.
But you have to be able to speak Spanish.
And you have to know the Spanish market.
Do you know Spain?
Yes. I know a little bit of Ibiza.
Then i decided
to move to Spain for 1 year.
I had blond hair when i was a
young boy, and i wanted to be a writer.
But I changed.
A human changes.
My mother is a 'speech water fall'.
A real 'speech water fall'.
The worst thing is..
that they say the truth.
You eat no bulgur, no tofu.
It is hopeless.
If you rather want junk food
filled with genetic manipulated shit..
pesticiden and prionen,
then do so.
I won't stop you.
I had doubts at first.
But on a second though
i decided i had to go.
...treated shit.
- Spain.
I did research on the
university exchange program.
It's called Erasmus
and it's a complete mess.
Just a moment.
You wonder who Erasmus is?
On the internet
i didn't really find usefull information
about it.
Apparantly it was a dutch traveller
around 1500 A.D.
I spent 3 months with the subscription.
That is nearby.
Did you speak with my colleague?
- Yes, just came back.
I want to request an Erasmus file.
Do you have your subscription form.
- I just received that.
Nothing has been filled in.
What do i have to do with this?
They lost your file.
I have to make a new one.
Bleh. You are all the same.
You wait until the last moment
for a file with documents of...
I have had it! They lost it.
It's not my mistake.
I just wanted to know
which papers i still need..
to...
have my file complete.
Right. Well, a Erasmus file for a
DEA is simple.
You need to know it.
It's written in the disclaimer.
The authorisation of your
project leader here,
the authorisation of the
foreign project leader,
the authorisation of
both universities,
your medical insurance card...
Are you registered at SMEREP or MNEF ?
MNEF.
- In that case
you have to get paper E-111
at the MNEF-Office
in building D at the ground floor.
Don't sigh. Your foreign
medical expenditure will not be compensated
without this form.
Fill in these things.
And the usual things.
A c.v.,
a letter with your motivation,
the titles of your doctorial etc..
All these things.
I don't know why the world
turned into a mess like this.
I don't know if the world had to
end up like this.
Everything is complicated,
badly developed and poorly written.
In former days you only had fields
with cows and chicken.
Everything was much easier.
In former days things were tangible.
In the children's books from Martine
you had animals...
you ate what you cultivated...
You made your own clothes and house.
Life was easy on the farm for Martine.
Why did we leave the world of martine?
Terrible.
What?
This sexistic.
What a bad look on the woman.
Why ?
Because she feeds chicken and
milks the cows?
No, its not that. But it is
your wet dream.
The kind little girl with
her dress and red cheeks.
Of course not.
My parents named me after her.
I'm becoming sick of this.
My mother used to read these books
as a child.
I think it's cute.
But, Martine...
It's not that bad.
Is it because of ''Martine'' that you...
I feel sad that you leave..
I feel sad aswell.
What's wrong?
Departure to barcelona.
Air France flight 6237.
Check in at hall C.
Wait, Martine.
She feels sad, doesn't she ?
I feel sad aswell.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Don't start, mom.
Isn't your father behind this?
No. I decided to do this myself.
My flight will take off soon.
Stop it.
I feel sad aswell.
Everyone feels sad.
You wouldn't think so though.
Attention, please.
Last passengers for Air France
Flight 6237 to Barcelona
are expected in hall C.
Don't cry. We will see eachother
soon.
Don't cry, Martine.
It will go fine.
Xavier, are you sure it is fine?
Shut up, mam.
Please, madam.
Do you want to have something to drink?
Erasmus ?
Yes.
What do you study?
- Economics.
Serious things.
Stock exchange and stuff.
something like that, yes.
And do you know barcelona?
No, i just landed.
You will enjoy yourself here.
Oh yes?
You bet. Wonderful city.
My suitcase.
- Good bye.
Do you have the key?
This is the typical dork
which i usually avoid.
But apparantly he wanted to
talk with me.
It's a lunatic city.
People go out having dinner at 10pm here.
You will not find anyone in
the restaurants earlier than 10pm.
After 10pm they eat like pigs.
They're little 'party numbers' in barcelona.
Do you know the 'barres de copas' ?
- No.
Then i won't give the show away.
You have to be well built for Erasmus.
You won't sleep much.
And you... what are you doing?
I'm a doctor. An important job
in the 'del Mar' hospital.
I'm a neurologist.
And you?
We are married for 2 weeks.
She's still awaiting.
But first she will learn Spanish.
You don't know Spanish?
No. Do you speak Spanish?
A little bit.
I come for my doctorial on
the university of Barcelona.
In an unknown city,
you will see long streets
wih meaningless buildings.
Everything is unknown, virgin territory.
Excuse me...
The street...
Carrer des Escudellers Blancs?
What?
I think... turn right at the end.
straight on.
- Like that?
Yes.
- Ok. Thank you.
In 1 year you will..
have lived in this city,
have walked all streets until the end
have known all these buildings,
have mixed with people.
When you have lived in this city,
you will have been in this street about
ten, twenty, thousand times
Ten, twenty, thousand times...
Urquinaona...
Passeig de Gracia...
Laietana...
After a period of time everything will
belong to you, because you have lived here.
Thus it would go with me aswell,
but i didn't know that yet.
Urquinaona.
This word with a Sioux-tone joined
itself at the long list
of the ridiculous names in
your occiput.
"Urquinaona" ensconced himself next
to Mouffetard,
Bondoufle, Pontault-Combault,
Marolles-and-Hurepois,
Mandelieu-La-Napoule
or Knokke-Zoute.
The name became normal and trusted.
Much later, when we were back in paris
the whole situation turned into
an exciting adventure.
The worst days of a journey,
the greatest failures
is what you tell most afterwards.
The door bell is not working
- What?
It's not working.
Who are you looking for?
A girl...
Sonia Miralpeix.
Ah yes.
Mr Miralpeix!
Yes?
- Hello.
I'm a Xavier
- Can you... the door?
Yes, Just a moment. I will open up.
Thank you.
- No problem.
A acquaintance of my mother arranged
the first few days of lodging
in Barcelona
Some more Coffee?
No, thanks.
Did your flight have a delay?
No.
That chap, a chilian,  has
a niece in Barcelona.
I could stay with her for a few days,
until i had an own apartment.
But i couldn't stay long.
She lived with her grandpa
and it was complicated.
It was complicated for me aswell.
It was already complicated before this,
But this was the typical
bungling by my mother.
Never listen to her again.
Never take part of her bungled plans anymore.
Yes.
Bleh. Thanks, mother.
Never listen to her, never
take part of her goddamn plans again.
Hello? Jean-Michel?
Yes, hello. Xavier speaking.
From the airport.
Right, yes.
Eh, yes.
You still remember me... right?
The airport?
Yes... Ok.
Listen.
I'm terrible sorry...
I'm terribly sorry that i have
to call you like this..
but i'm in deep shit.
C'mon, please.
No, there are a few chaps here...
Look, you told me that you could...
Oh, right... right...
That is very... yes...
Yes, that is...
That is very...
That is very kind of you.
Yes, because here...
I don't know exactly who is dead,
but she is in chile now
and i have no place to stay.
That is no problem at all.
I told you?
We just arrived aswell,
so we'll just have to make do with it.
Make yourself at home.
I had it the first time also.
We 'Galliërs' must nevertheless
help each other?
You can sleep on the sofa.
Anne-So prepares a meal.
Yes.
Are you hungry?
Yes.
I have not much to offer.
I have...
rice...
or pasta.
Including...
We have no butter,
but we have oil...
Very well! Pasta with olive-oil.
Just make do, go.
Go.
Sorry, man.
We could not do differently.
Oh yes, yes. No... doesn't matter.
Do you want some coffee?
Why not?
You think that it's architectonic complex.
but the brains function
rather simple.
hypophysis... hypothalamus...
There you have the braincortex.
With the 2 hemispheres.
The memory area is located...
in the hypocampus...
inside the temporal lobe.
I summarise it of course,
because the memory...
My section covers the relations
between this brain-area here,
which comprises about the memory,
and that area there which controls the language.
We came across remarkable pathologies.
Thus, a bilingual can be meet
by an amnesia
that knew only one language.
Really?
- Certainly.
He can only speak his mother language
because of a lambda-trauma
His 2nd language... gone.
Erased of the hard disk.
Smart, isnt it?
I have your...
I have seen your advertisement
in the newspaper.
Yes, for the apartment.
Yes, and I would gladly...
Share... share...
It is a difficult task to find a flat in Barcelona .
Hello.
And? Do you take it?
50.000 a month. Ok?
That's equal to about 1000 euro.
50.000. Take it or leave it?
- Yes, very well.
50.000, the first of the month.
- I will look.
We want to sell it also.
The first of the month. If not...
I have to leave, it's urgent.
Can you do something for me?
Yes.
Certainly, absolutely no problem.
Can you take Anne-So out?
She doesn't like to go out on herself.
and, because you speak some Spanish...
Yes, yes... No, no, certainly.
No problem. I... yes.
I saw you crying in the plane.
Oh yes?
You looked so sad.
I became sad of it myself.
Yes, you think that you're glad
to leave
that you are strong...
But onboard the plane i no longer knew.
Leaving isn't easy.
You will leave things behind, you don't
know where you will end up.
Yes. It is a strange mixture.
It's exact the same for me.
I'm in raptures with Jean-Michel.
I really wanted to go with him
and experience something intensely,
but at the same time I am frightened.
Starting a new life.
Learning a new language
I have the feeling that i stand
in front of a mountain.
Yes.
lk felt the need to frequently
write Martine.
lk wrote things,
which I would have never said to her in person.
lk had been always very reserved.
With that distance between us
i seemed to be able to talk about more things.
And that brought me closer to her.
I received your letter.
It's nice to hear from you.
But sometimes i find it stupid
When you praise Barcelona like that.
I am happy and jealous at the same time.
It isn't easy to be located far from
each other.
I count the days that i want
to be close to you.
I love you.
Sharing a flat sometimes look like
taking an exam.
Tarragona.
I have lived in Paris.
Jesus, Tobias.
Why do you ask that?
C'mon.
Terrible. It doesn't always go like this.
In fact, he is quite nice.
I felt myself comfortable immediately.
I really wanted them to
accept me.
The confusion which dominated there
seemed like my own muddle.
Their wrangle seemed equal to
the wrangles i have had in my head for years.
Class has started
and i didn't have a flat yet.
Cya later, Anne-Sophie.
I don't understand these Catalonian classes.
Do you?
It can't go on like this.
Someone has to ask him
Who will ask him to talk in Catalan?
Do you guys study french?
The french classes?
Bleh, what a fuss.
Who?
- You.
Fine. Good morning everyone.
We talk about the future of
world capitalism today.
Sir, please?
Excuse me,
but can you talk in castalian?
I'm affraid that is not possible.
Most students are Catalonians,
there is no reason to change.
There are 15 Erasmus-students
who don't speak Catalan.
And Spanish is not a problem for you.
I understand, miss.
I understand it well.
But you have to understand me aswell.
We are in Catalonia
and Catalan is an official language here.
Go to Madrid or America if you
want spanish.
Now... the future
of world capitalism. What
can we tell about that system?
I liked the girl.
She didn't fit to Economics.
I was wondering what she was doing here.
Like i have been asking what i
was doing myself.
There was only one currency: Gold
I speak Catalan because i
am Catalonian and i live in Catalonia.
I find it strange that you
defent the Catalan language..
when we build on Europe together.
No, thats not my opinion.
I think it is about identities here.
An unique valid identity doesn't exist.
But a number of identities which goes complete together do.
It's about respect.
For example, i have at least
2 identities:
the Gambian, where i originate from
and the Catalan identity.
I don't find it contradictory to defend those two.
You are a Frenchman
Or you are from Mars... No.
You are a Frenchman and you have
the French identity.
Do you understand?
Your "identité"... Asterix.
Francoise Hardy.
Cheese.
I'll give you my "pan tumaca".
- What?
"Pan", bread. Bread-tomate.
The song.
I'll give you my... my Dali.
Spain is more than "olé".
It's more than only flamenco.
It's flamenco and much more.
And Catalan belongs to that.
This 'sailing' between languages is
certain disrupting.
You have that in belgium aswell,
with Flamish and...
Walloon ? That's complete different.
I am Walloon,
but i don't speak Flamish.
I act like a Frenchwoman in Flanders.
Then they will talk French to me.
Yes? Really?
Fine, fine. Very well.
Yes, great.
They won't answer me when they see
through that i am a Walloon
Fine. No problem.
Great! I have a flat.
Nice.
- Yes... eh... true.
Well.
I have a crappy room at the mother
of my employer.
What do you do?
- I'm au pair. Babysit.
Well, great!
I guess...
Great for you.
- Yes, for me.
I feel sad that you leave.
I want to write books.
Hello, Wendy.
Hi.
How's it going?
- Fine.
What is that ?
- Babylonia.
"The Spanish inn"
It was there litterally,
a Spanish inn.
Let's see... Inn...
"Spanish Inns is like reading,
You will only find what
you bring with yourself"
Maurois.
It's hard to explain,
but it is something like this.
Hello..
lk take the telephone by way of illustration.
Or no, the refrigerator.
Alessandro, your feet.
- It's only water.
Please, Tobias.
Anyone wants some tea?
- No, thanks.
No?
- Shall we?
Yes?
Byee.
Of course not.
But you will visit me soon.
sure.
Ofcourse.
No.
C'mon.
I cannot talk freely.
Because i'm not alone.
We are not going out for dinner,
i have got no money.
Of course not.
Not at all. Only...
Really not.
Not one,
but five people are here with me.
Let's not bicker via the telephone.
You will see me soon.
I desire you.
But of course.
Me too. Thats for sure.
I love you too.
I love you too.
We'll call soon. Kisses.
I love you, my dear.
I'm crazy on you, my dear.
Hello?
Just a moment.
Xavier is not here.
He returns tonight.
Ok?
Xavier is
not here right now.
he will come
back tonight.
Yes, but at what time?
Tell him that he should call his mother.
His mom. I will tell him.
Promise?
Oh, right. To the fac.
Fuck?
- Yes, after the fac
Can he call mom.
- Wendy, relax.
Splendid, hè?
Anne-Sophie!
Are you not feeling well?
Did you have a nice afternoon?
- Very nice.
How did you get to know each other?
In Dinard.
In a pizzeria.
We went there each day,
There was a coloured italian waiter.
Today i am 'onna introduce ou:
melon and gham.
Very nice. Buonissimo.
Did he say that each day?
Each day. For two weeks.
And really every day?
I worked in the hospital
and Anne-Sophie...
Tell him.
No, you tell him.
You go on.
ah!, tell us, Anne-So.
Why did you come there each day?
No!
Don't be so shy.
Come on, tell!
No, i find it embarrassing.
Wussy. What is so embarrassing about it?
Well, it's just personal.
I don't have to tell it.
Come.
No, never mind.
It doesn't matter. You don't have to.
If she doesn't feel like it.
Say it, damned.
It doesn't matter indeed.
Don't be so taken aback.
Well...
The first time
i saw Jean-Michel,
i knew i was in love,
after the first glance.
Just all of a sudden.
Totally in love.
I saw him and thought:
"gee, that is my husband"
Love at first sight.
Exactly.
You are intolerable.
Damn, again.
Yes, hello?
Can you call back after 8 'o clock?
Thank you.
Stupid bastards.
Good afternoon.
- Hi, Mr Cucurull.
I will show Mister the flat.
Why?
- I will not talk with you.
Cycles put in the corridor, just like that.
That must be repainted.
Move along.
Dear god.
The cupboard of granny.
The living room...
The saint virgin.
A saint virgin stood here.
Where did it go?
The madonna stands... somewhere else.
It's a mess.
Quick, give it to me.
Hurry up!
Just a moment.
You have to vacate the flat before March.
- But...
I will walk along to the door.
This looks like shit.
Can you say why?
- No.
I don't want students anymore.
But why?
- Look at the mess.
I said before, clean up.
- But why me?
I didn't do the dishes because i thought
Lars and Soledad still had to eat.
Then i started to watch tv and
you did them.
I wanted to do it,
but you are such a maniac...
What?
I don't want to live in a stable!
And i'm not a maniac.
Always full of promises,
but you never do something.
You seem like a serious young person to me.
I will talk with you as from next month .
And as of now it is 180.000 pesetas.
180.000 pesetas?
- Yes.
Hundred Eighty Thousand pesetas?
We must add another person.
I know someone from my Economics Class,
It's a nice person.
Who?
- It's a girl.
Very serious.
And if you say "Je vais la fac" ?
I speak french.
Oh really?
- I have lived in Paris.
I will call you later.
- Cya later.
She's nice.
We can find better.
Doesn't she please you?
Have fun.
You have alot of things which I own aswell.
Heey, you have Ali Farka Toure.
- You aswell?
What are you doing tomorrow?
My girlfriend 'Sabine' is coming over
from Belgium.
Cool.
Sabine?
- Xavier?
Hello.
It's here.
I really miss you.
I can sit on the beach and still miss you.
It's sunday tomorrow
and we're going to Sitges.
Thats another beach close to here.
I'm at the beach in Barcelona right now.
Sitges is some where else.
No idea, it's different for sure.
Just another beach.
With that French Couple.
From the plane, where i stayed.
Well, not real sociably,
but they're quite nice.
Is France somewhere that way?
No, i would rather say this way.
Well, hey.
We will not have seen each other much.
Cya soon.
Hello, everybody.
Do you want...
And you slept together in 1 bed?
yes.
- Here?
Yes.
What? She's my girlfriend.
Did you do things together?
Yes, we did.
She's my girlfriend.
My wife.
I'm lesbian.
Right.
When is your girlfriend coming?
Mine?
She's coming soon.
She still has some things to do.
She has a heap of things on her mind.
Good luck then.
Chicks are crazy.
I am really hungry.
I don't know if it tastes good,
usually it's prepared different.
What is it?
- Gratin dauphinois.
A little bit like tortilla.
- I like tortilla.
It's not exactly like tortilla.
There are no eggs in it.
I'm fed up with Tortilla without eggs.
You are not funny, Alessandro.
- Look out!
Where are you?
- Here, darling.
Xavier, where are you?
We have to check the...
The meter.
The cutouts.
Wendy? We are here.
We are coming.
We are here.
God.
Hello.
- Everything ok?
Come.
Shall we?
Calle Porta Ferissa.
Well then...
Stay with them if you like.
- Nah.
Is that English chit not a bit fussy?
Not at all. She is very nice.
Such a narrow-minded bitch.
Does she have a boy friend?
Yes, she has a boy friend.
And she isn't narrow-minded at all.
They have managed to saddle you with
the most stupid room.
It's not stupid.
And we will move in 2 months.
Do you plan to start moaning?
You described it as being a palace.
And this is really...
Your room is plainly stuffy.
Look at that wallpaper.
Sorry, but i can't do it this way.
It doesn't matter.
We just have to get used to each other.
I understand. It really doesn't matter.
And with that mess alongside.
It is really stupid.
Do you find it terrible?
- Of course not. I understand it really.
It doesn't matter.
I know we don't have much time.
I become paralysed of fear of failure.
It's stupid.
i find it stupid.
Stop it. It really doesn't matter.
I had the painful feeling
that the parting lasted longer than the
reunion.
Love is awful.
I find it hard.
Yes.
But still i love her.
but this way...
It's exactly the same for me.
Sabina went back home angry.
But i have to admit...
- What?
It was quite stupid to say that i
got myself chat up.
Oh yes?
By who? By a chap?
Ofcourse not.
By my flamenco-teacher.
We were in class together.
And then...
she was demonstrating a dance.
She was...
too beautiful.
It got me the shivers.
She looked with those eyes.
And then she came closer.
Closer and closer.
Very charming.
Afterwards she was very harsh
She beat my thighs.
No so fast.
Go on.
She pulled me close to herself.
Then she turned around.
I couldn't do anything.
I was...
Paralysed.
She totally dominated me.
And then?
It was delightful.
She kissed me.
So.
Jesus.
And you told Sabine about this?
No, not with those words.
Not?
No.
Don't you study too much?
Do you want to have something to drink?
No, thank you.
I pay, boy.
You sit here all day.
Take a chupito.
What?
Where are you from?
- France.
France?
France... Erasmus ?
Yes.
Have you been in Barcelona for a long time?
Two month.
- Months.
Yes, damned. Two months.
Exactly. You visit class too much, do you?
You must come more often here.
Here you will learn what really is important.
Juan!
Don't make his imagination run wild.
Wait, i give him spanish lessons...
What is your name?
Very good, Xavier.
An example...
Do you know what a "French man" is?
No... what?
A "French man"?
If you come more often you will learn
"the puta madre" -Spanish.
You are a master within 2 months.
He will never come back.
Thanks to Juan i spoke "the puta madre"
-Spanish, after a few months.
And this way i frequently visited the bar
from Juan and Neus.
Whats happening?
- We're having a party.
Anne-Sophie, Juan.
Hello.
Hello, Xavier.
- Hi, Neus. Everything O.K.?
Xavier talks alot about you,
but he didn't mention you are so good-looking.
You didn't say anything, bastard!
What's he saying?
- He says...
that you are welcome in his café.
Rotter.
- We're going to dance. Come.
Hello, darling.
You promised to come.
This is harsh.
No, but i have no money, Martine.
I'm sorry.
I know i promised.
I didn't have money either,
but i have come nevertheless.
It leaves you cold, hè ?
It doesn't leave me cold.
It does. You never keep your word.
I'm fed up with it.
This is real mean
for my birthday.
Where are you? At the beach again?
No, in Barcelona. On the street.
Yes, there is music. I stand in front of a bar.
There is music everywhere.
Stop it.
it smells here.
Too bad barcelona is quite dirty.
not as dirty as Paris.
Yes it is.
A lot of places here look like the third world.
Thus i know a bunch like that in Paris aswell.
But ofcourse you don't know those.
Do you think i'm narrow-minded?
No.
I think so though. I know what you're thinking.
''That poor lady is utter narrow-minded."
No, thats not true.
Do you think i'm corny?
A little bit, yes
You're not really
"juanita banana".
What does that mean?
You are not really 'rock 'n roll'.
But you know that aswell.
Yes, i know.
Do you think thats disturbing?
No.
I do.
I'm not retarded, Xavier.
You're smooth.
Everywhere. Always.
You will speak Spanish after a few months.
You be on first-name terms for everyone
I can't do that.
i have been raised different.
I'm not that smooth.
I know that you have to be cool in here.
But i'm not a cool girl.
Not rock 'n roll.
It's not that bad.
But you don't have to call Barcelona dirty for that.
That's no lack of rock 'n roll, but racism.
Racism?
- Yes.
Oké. I'm sorry.
I didn't want to offend you.
That was not the point.
You are not in France
You are 6 months here now.
Look around you a bit.
I look around myself, Xavier.
You are quite harsh with me.
The latent value of a company
is always subordinate to the
decrease of the competition.
Hello, Anne-Sophie ?
It's Xavier.
Yes.
Today?
Yes, ofcourse.
Ofcourse.
Good.
Cya in a bit.
Sorry.
Nice, hè?
Are you frightened?
A little bit.
It's stupid, but i have Acrophobia.
(fear of hights)
Too bad Jean-Michel won't see this.
The poor soul has to work so hard.
Don't you find it terrible that he has to
work quite alot
and that you are alone frequently,
while you are here to stay with him.
Yes.
But i frequently rebuke him for that.
Is Suzana not here?
She went out to buy some cigs.
What?
No, nothing.
- No, tell me.
Say it.
- It's stupid
i ask myself a lot if girls use dildo's on each other.
boys often get entirely nothing of women.
Both sexes sit in their own corner without
really giving much thought about the other one.
A man who really cared for the female
would be omnipotent.
How do you mean?
You don't understand that women have a different
Psychology
You don't know the woman body.
You don't know what she finds really nice.
Why do you think that?
You think that only your dick is important.
Whereas stroking is as important.
I know that.
But you obviously don't do a good job at it.
Look.
Come... Come here.
What?
When you stroke the buttocks of a woman...
You stroke her here...
And here. On her buttocks.
Wait...
You put her legs apart.
This is embarrassing.
I only show it to you.
You push her sturdy towards you.
She can't move.
She has to feel that you hold her sturdy.
It doesn't matter what people will claim,
many woman want that firmly grasp.
The feeling to be captive.
Stop it.
What are you doing?
- I'm just explaining.
Don't you want me to explain it?
Yes. Go on.
You push her sturdy towards you.
Then you stroke her hair...
her neck...
het breasts...
And then she will react in the exact
same way as you.
You appease her, you will take your time.
Good?
- Yes.
I will instruct you how to let her enjoy oneself.
Come here.
I want to instruct Xavier something.
Practical lessons.
Every man should learn this.
Hello.
Nice to see you.
Yes, hello.
Quite funny that we met here.
It was our first trip.
- Yes, thats true..
What are you doing?
I can't resist. I want you.
No... No, what is this supposed to mean?
Nothing at all.
I am married.
No, i am married.
Stop it. No...
l can't.
No... no...
It was wonderful.
Entirely as in the movie.
First she was like "No, no, no."
But then it turned into
''Yes, o yes, yes.''
I did not know that something like that existed.
I said so.. All sluts.
You are right. Unbelievable.
Next time
i will grab her head and say:
"Blow, dirty bitch!"
- No.
You can't say that.
Living in the Inn became organised.
Especially Wendy did housekeeping.
And we helped him from time to time.
The contents of the refrigerator also got put in order.
Damned. Alessandro !
Alessandro is not here.
Listen, boys.
I really enjoy your monologues.
Wendy?
- Yes?
We are going out tonight.
Hello.
Wendy?
- Yes?
Can i speak to you for a bit?
- In Spanish?
If you want.
- What do you want to talk about?
About your brother.
I think you will make me go crazy sometime.
We can't do it at your home.
I can better leave.
Are you sure?
Don't take it up wrong.
Wow, Xavier !
How nice to see you.
That's a long time ago.
Yes, that's true. But i was just leaving.
No, stay.
At least for a drink.
Fine.
- I will put my stuff aside.
Stay... Stay here.
Shut up.
Well, my dear Xavier?
I heard you take my wife to some crafty pubs
Yes, i take her into evil ways.
A little bit.
Everything oké, darling ?
- Yes. l'm tired.
Hello?... Just a moment.
Xavier... i care for you.
Yes, hello. Everything oké ?
Quite long?
How long?
Who is it?
what's his name?
What can i say?
Right, yes. Cya later.
Yes, i...
Xavier, my friend...
Unbelievable!
To Barcelona!
The girls from Paris!
You don't love me either.
- I do love you.
It doesn't matter that i left.
It was a piece of luck.
But too bad it couldn't work out together.
But that doesn't mean we should split up because of that.
You have never loved me.
You can't love anyone.
You only think of yourself.
Your study, your career at the ministry.
Not at all!
- Yes you do!
Your parents would like a job like that.
Your father, the friend of your father,
your mother.
You do love your mother, don't you?
- No!
Don't worry, there are no traffic-jams.
We will be at the airport in 15 minutes.
I'm happy that i have seen you.
Even when it was so short.
You still don't want to say why you
visited for just 1 day?
We can talk, can't we?
Aren't you happy to see me?
- Shut up!
Damned, mom!
Shut up!
Anna!
I didn't know what happened until later.
Sometimes life is worse than a bad soap.
That means: Is that baby yours?
And that means: Yes.
And he is yours aswell.
And that is something like:
Why didn't you say that earlier?
It wasn't possible to reach you.
And i wanted to keep it without saying anything
I thought i could take care of it.
But it's getting too heavy after 6 months.
I'm alone and the baby has no father.
Oh, a baby!
You have no idea...
I'm sick and tired of your plans.
You are a father.
You have a child.
I don't know, howl, cry,
but do something!
Don't keep standing here damned!
Why has my life always been such a mess.
It always has been complicated,
bloody awful, disorderly, messy.
The life of the others seems
easier,logical.
In my past days my life didn't
mean anything.
But now it is even worse...
less than nothing.
Everything went to damnation.
I saw Wendy with her American friend
on the way to Mare Magnum.
And suddenly i walked into Erasmus.
Erasmus?
- Yes.
Sorry, i don't understand.
It doesn't matter.
I was so happy to see you.
It doesn't matter.
I was very excited in the beginning.
It doesn't matter.
I know, but still...
Really, Xavier...
It doesn't matter.
I was happy to see you.
Erasmus?
Yes?
Sorry, i don't think it is going
fine with me.
I don't sleep, i am depressive.
Is it still normal?
Maybe it's nothing bad.
It can just be your ordinary limbic system.
What is that?
The primitive part of the human brain.
The seat of the animal emotions.
The cortex sends the more educated
responses.
Maybe you must...
- That would be it.
Do you get visions from that?
Do you have visions?
What do you see?
I see Erasmus.
We will do some tests.
Close your eyes and count till 10.
one...
I am looking for the hypocampus.
In the internal part of the temporal
lobe.
But...
But i don't speak french.
No fear, we will clean everything up.
I lost my native language.
What are you doing there, darling?
Well, nothing.
I walk a little bit around.
Xavier...
You will make me crazy sometime.
Jean-Michel !
Now then...
The results of all the tests.
Exactly what i thought. There is nothing
wrong with you. Just some stress
You have seen nothing that...
No. You will see everything
on the scanner now.
And so...
I told you, nothing.
But...
You will stop to see Anne-Sophie.
She owned up to her mistakes.
I don't want you to see her anymore.
And i don't want to see you either.
But...
- Shut up.
I didn't see Anne-Sophie any longer.
But Wendy continued to see her
American friend.
Hello?
Hello ?
Do you know who Alistair is?
Alistair is the friend of Wendy.
Yes, i am sure.
Damned!
We saw him when he came by for a visit.
Why?
Because he just arrived in Barcelona.
Just arrived? In Barcelona?
No way! Damned.
We have to be ahead of him.
Yes, Yes!
Wendy... Wendy...
Zero, zero...
Wendy.
Damned!
I have telephone. Look out.
Yes?
Hi, Alessandro. Tell it.
What?
Damned... all right.
Ok, ok. Yes, cya in a bit.
- What's happening?
Hello ?
Yes ?
Damned.
Damned.
Any success, Lars ?
- Yes.
Mate!
- Sorry.
Now what?
He's getting suspicious.
- Just pretend that your key doesn't work either.
The year almost passed by.
I started to examine
what i would have wanted to do
in Barcelona
and what i had not done.
Have you been on the Montjuic?
I must have missed alot of things.
Stupid that you are not a girl.
The world is a badly divided place.
I would leave the next day.
We went to a bar to say good-bye to each other.
But i wasn't ready for it.
My luggage wasn't packed yet.
It's boiling here.
Hello. What are you doing here?
- Soledad is a friend.
Really? I have lived at her place for over 1 year.
Well, in the same flat.
Yes. I knew.
- Oh really?
We should leave now.
I have to get up early tomorrow and...
Excuse me.
Thanks in advance. It was really nice.
I found it nice that you came here.
I really do.
I just wanted to say that.
Well, cya later i guess.
Cya later, Anne-Sophie.
Yes, Cya.
Xavier...
Thank you.
Thanks very much.
- Cya later.
Continue practicing spanish.
- Yes, cya later.
Cya later.
Have a good trip.
Cya later.
Go.
Bye.
I will go to France next year.
You speak french.
- Yes.
You never told me that.
I have to go.
We will see each other.
Have a good trip.
Cya later.
And keep talking in Catalan!
Cabron! come on, man.
Piss off now.
I'm crazy about foie grass.
It was strange to buy meat.
Like if it was years ago.
You will like it.
It's coming from your favorite butcher.
Give it to me.
Thanks.
And?
Are you happy to be back?
Yes... yes.
You're not saying anything.
Well, i don't know...
It was fun.
Tell me.
Mom, i have been there for over 1 year.
Exactly, 1 year. And you're not
telling anything.
Come on, stop it. Mom.
Mom...
I'm glad to see you.
hmm, i can't really tell though.
Why did you have to say that?
- Well, i said it because...
Because...
Because i knew it would hurt you.
I really know that you have cared for me.
But sometimes people feel the need
to twist the knife into the wound.
Now then...
I knew that this was our last kiss.
I thought of the first one.
That was in the Rue d'Orchampt.
why had we chosen the street with
the smallest pavement?
There has happened a lot between both
kisses.
All streets where I have been with
her.
The intricated course.
To end up here...
Today...
Without her.
I ended up in the streets of Paris
where citizens of Paris never come.
I was a stranger along the strangers.
I didn't know why i was there.
I have never known why i was anywhere.
I guess i have a typical looking head.
Erasmus?
Why?
I was selected.
This is my first working day.
I had exactly the same stomach-ache as
the one i get
on the first day of school or on a
test day.
That damned stomach-ache.
I thought it was something from
the past.
It's here.
Number 2038.
The office.
I heard you were here.
Welcome to the club.
Hi, Bernard.
- Morning, sir.
Explain him everything clearly.
This is the file where i was talking
about.
Unfortunately i have no time now.
But we will see each other soon.
Cya later.
Cup of Coffee?
The building is a little bit gloomy,
but the atmosphere is great.
That's true.
We laugh a lot.
Not, monsieur Bernard?
Just wait and see.
- Come on.
What's your age?
25.
Then you will become an early retirement.
They heat the affair rockly-hard.
That's why i set the heat on 2.
That's fine. More than enough.
You can't make mix ups with the files.
You have the yellow... the blue
and the red.
That also applies to the computer.
The European Commission is very
precise about it.
They don't make jokes.
keeping order is necessary.
Everything on its place and a place
for everything.
Not, monsieur Bernard?
I choose for a hopeless future.
I will do what i always wanted to do.
I will write.
...Clear now. Everything seems obvious,
simple, clear now.
I'm not.
And this isn't either.
And that no more than.
But i'm all that.
I am him...
Him... and him.
But also him and him.
And him.
And i am also him.
- I want to write books.
And i don't
want to disappoint him.
I am her... her...
and also her.
I am a Frenchman, Spaniard,
Englishman, Danish.
I am not one, but many.
I'm like Europe.
I am all that.
I'm a big mess.
Finally i can start telling everything.
Everything has started there,
with taking off.
No, it is not a story of a plane which is taking off.
It isn't about taking off.
Or maybe it is,
it is about taking off.
Everything started there.
