Hey, guys, she's all ours...
nice and legal.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Are you ok?
All right.
I would have won.
You had to cheat to beat me...
force me off the road.
That ain't racin'.
That's trying to murder someone.
You lost, guy.
What can I say?
Now take your girl and walk.
I think you'll find it
safer that way.
You're nothing but road pirates.
You got to cheat to win.
Let's go, George.

Bye, George.

[Engine revving]
Hey, is this the way
to Crawford dam?
Uh-huh. It's...
it's a little ways up.
And then you take
the willow river cut-off.
Thanks.
Hey, wait!
Uh, are you new in town?
Yeah.
I, uh...
Um... Hey,
I'll show you the way.
Hop on.
Ok.
I'm Jake kesey.
I'm keri Johnson.
Oh, great.
[Engine revs]
I can't ride.
Boyfriend?
No way.
Man: Keri.
Get in.
Who's the kid?
I was just walking
out of my house.
Turned my back,
and the next second
he was there.
Like magic almost.
Really?
Yeah, really.
Seemed familiar to me.
What did he want?
Nothing.
He's new in town.
You know you can get killed
riding on the back
of bikes, keri.
Excuse me?
You're mine.
And I'll do anything necessary
to keep it that way.
[Indistinct chatter]
You think you own me...
that somehow I'm your
private property.
You are. Nobody loves
you as much as I do.
It's because everybody's
scared of you.
If you're not going
to be my girl,
you're not going
to be anybody's.
Minty, give me a light.
Here you go!
Hey, bro.
Man, it's a hot one today, huh?
Look, do you mind
if I lay my towel here?
I ain't welcome over there.
Why ain't I welcome?
Or it's ok to lay here?
Take your pick.
Hey, you new in town
or something?
Got a name?
Jake.
Jake, I'm Billy hankins.
I work over at big kay's
slinging burgers.
Listen, you ever need
a burger in Brooks,
you call me, ok?
Man, she's beautiful,
don't you think?
Me and her are pretty
good friends.
Well, actually she's...
she used to be tight
with my brother.
She's got real problems
with that lunatic
she's with there now.
What kind of problems?
Well, packard's
a mistake of nature...
a genetic misfire.
He's what?
Packard gets crazy jealous
if anybody even looks
at keri cross-eyed.
You got to wear dark glasses
so he doesn't catch you at it.
That includes your brother,
I assume, right?
My brother jaime?
The guy you were
just talking about.
He's dead.
He was murdered
up on the willow river.
But nobody ever knew who did it.
I'm sorry, man.
I had no idea.
It's ok, bro.
Ahh!
Aah!
[Girl screaming]
Ugh!
<i>[Smokin' in the boys room</i>
by motley crue playing]
Look at all these girls.
Laying around on the rocks,
they hardly got any clothes on.
Jesus, boy!
This shit's got some kick.
[Car horn blares]
Lot of duck butter out
at the lake today, eh, pack.
Quiff city, here I come!
See that guy over there?
The one with Billy hankins?
What about him?
Looks like a dork to me.
Lot of dorks going
around these days.
Whole... whole town
is seething with them.
They're crawling
out of the woodwork.
Shut up.
Ok.
Drives that motorbike
over there.
You see him or Billy
around keri,
Oh, shit, pack, I'd rather
be working on the car...
we do things my way, skank,
and it's a lot of fun.
I know that's easy
for you to forget
with your brain turning
to mush and all.
Actually, my brain's
functioning a-ok, dude.
so let's just do things
my way, huh?
Before I have to cut
another ringhole
in this flap you call your ear.
Hey, we'll remind
the cock-stacker.
We'll use our influence,
hey, gut?
We'll use our influence.
Remember, the kid on the bike.
You got it, pack.
It's all programmed in, man.
Good.
And, skank...
Do me a favor, will you?
Get rid of that zombie
piss you're drinking
before it turns you
into a mushroom.
No problem.
Yeah, right.
Ah, damn.
Mushroom.
It's a nice day, huh?
This water's a bit chilly
for my taste.
Good thing it's warm out.
Sorry about the ride
this morning.
It's ok.
Billy hankins a friend of yours?
Yeah, sort of.
Keri!
I'd better go now.
Don't go because of me.
Not because of you.
It's because of him.
You don't know him.
Keri!
You know, if you want
to come by some night...
Yeah?
I mean after work.
I'll be there.
Well, so will I then.
The thing is, where's work?
Heh! Big kay's burgers.
Big kay's burgers?
Yeah.
All right.
Ok.

Oh, man.
Hello, keri.
Looks like I got here
just in time.
You...
In the car.
I mean now.
Hey, listen, pack, I was
just on my way out, too.
Hold your horses, guy.
Packard, please.
Just get in the car
for a minute.
I just want to speak
to Billy alone.
Help her out.
So what happened here?
Looks to me like you ran
out of those all-beef patties
kind of early today, huh?
Hey, don't worry, pack.
We still got plenty of dog food.
Hey, packard, let's
grind up some meat, huh?
or is he just a
naturally gifted child?
I swear to God.
I'll rip your head off
Hold your water, oggie.
This is business.
Nothing personal, guy.
That's a nice car you have here.
Now where were you going
with my girl?
I was just giving her
a ride home, man.
Give me a break.
Hey, rughead...
What's this triumph worth?
You're not getting it, packard!
You're not taking it.
Who said anything
about taking it?
I didn't say nothing.
I know I didn't.
I tell you what.
I'm going to give you
the same chance
I give everybody else.
We're gonna race for it.
Look, pack,
you don't get my car.
you're not going to get
your burgers
with the Mayo
and thousand island
the way you love 'em.
Billy...
Billy, I thought
you understood me.
This isn't a negotiation.
[Tires squealing]
Rugs...
You ever seen
one of those before?
Nah, let's just at it
to our collection first.
We can figure out
what it is second.
we'll continue this
discussion later,
and I'll enjoy it.
I'll see you later, eh, faggot?
Hey, packard, I think
he's going to Sandy bar.
Let me take him this time!
All right, it's your turn, dude.
Let's go!
All right!
All right, I want you
to tear this guy a new asshole.
Do it to him oggie-style.
I'll burn this iranian.
Ok, the first to
rattler's crossing wins!
You lose the race,
you lose your car.
Agreed?
Stay on your side
of the road, man.
Ok, let's get it on!
Send them off!
Say what?
I said send them off!
Take the willow river
cut-off.
Ready!
Set!
Go!
[Sirens]
[Police radio chatter]
Man: Uh, Roger that,
Murphy.
Paramedics have been notified,
they are on their way.
Officer: You think
he made it?
Second officer:
You gotta be kidding me.
Local kid?
Call the meat wagon,
then get a hold of loomis,
tell him we got a possible
d.O.A. Up here.
Loomis, we got
a snuffed kid up here
at muletail coulee.
It's oggie fisher.
Radio: Uh, Roger that,
this is Stokes, Murphy.
We, uh, just saw a paramedic
down at the cut-off...
I've been waiting to catch
you guys in the act.
I've been waiting and watching.
Congratulations.
You caught us talking.
There's no law against
that, is there, officer?
Unless, of course,
I got my wires crossed
and you caught us
speaking without a per...
clam it, wise guy!
There's a dead kid
3 Miles up the highway.
[Whimpering]
Yeah, that's right. Dead.
Run off the highway and killed.
Ok, pal.
Time to drain the drug overdose
sloshing above your eyebrows
and tell me who the dude was
driving that other car.
With all due respect, sir...
If you're putting us
under arrest,
I do believe we have
right to counsel.
What about you, maggot, huh?
You got anything to say,
or are your veins bloated
with brain eradicator, too?
Yeah, well, who got killed?
Oggie fisher.
And there isn't
enough left of him
Man: Hey, loomis, I think
you ought to see this!
Oh, Murphy, what for?
I think you should see this.
Oh, that's ugly.
Kid ought to be dog meat.
Wait a minute.
Yeah, loomis,
this kid smashed down a canyon
through fire and bustin' glass.
Must have been
1,000 degrees in that car.
Uh-huh. At least.
Where's his eyes?
Sent cats climbing up my spine
when I saw them
hauling this corpse
out of that canyon.
Clean, as if he come
out of a hot tub.
I'm worried, loomis.
Something ain't right.
Well...
Get him into town
and box him up.
I've still got a few rocks
to turn over up here.
All right, load him up.
[Laughs]
You don't even want to know
what I just saw, asswipe.
Now spill it. Who was
driving that other car?
Nobody ever saw it before.
Wasn't a local car.
It was...
it was customized or something.
Yeah, it was like
a v-dub conversion
and a surf-rack on top.
Oh, it was awesome, man.
Well, no one seems
to be too broken up
about Mr. fisher
laying there,
splayed out to 4 points
of the compass.
But, then again,
maybe that's what things
have come down to, huh?
Deputy halifax over there
is gonna take down
a list of names for me,
so if any of you guys
are planning on
taking a vacation
in the next few days,
you can just forget it.
I'll be visiting you
again with warrants,
Mr. attorney.
Ok, halifax, they're all yours.
Oggie fisher.
They got us all.
Let's cruise.
Yo, gutterboy!
What, skank?
Let's jam.
Yo, rugs.
That kid in the Daytona
gave me a hell
of a run last night.
If I hadn't tried to kill him,
When's the new injection
plant going to be ready?
Tonight, maybe?
Maybe tomorrow.
The digital radio killers,
they're almost ready, too.
Good. The sooner
the better.
Things are getting a little
too equal these days.
Sure, packard.
Hey. Hey!
What seems to be the problem?
I just can't believe
that oggie's dead.
I mean, he lived just
up the street from me.
I just can't believe it.
Oggie's no loss, believe me.
Now, tell me something.
What were you doing with
Billy hankins today?
I was tired.
I decided to go home.
Don't lie to me.
I love you too much
for you to lie.
I'm not lying, packard.
You and me...
We're like blood brothers.
I guess you could call us
blood lovers...
Because that's how
much I love you.
And when you love someone
as much as I love you,
after a while, you feel nothing.
And when you feel nothing,
you can do anything.
I don't love you.
I've never made love to you.
I never will.
You will.
Hey, rug.
How we doing
on the digital radio killer?
It's tits, man.
It's totally functional.
Yeah, what about
the injection plant?
Oh, it's ready.
It's ready?
it'll blow away anything
this side of the Mississippi.
Good. Now all
we have to do
is fit it in the 'vette.
I can fit this thing
in a go cart,
what are you worried about?
[Rock music playing]
When this thing
gonna be chopped?
Tomorrow morn... morning.
Tonight.
You got that, gutterboy?
Yeah, ok.
What about those, uh...
yeah, packard, I got
those elbow parts
sold to the nagoles boys
for 2,900 bucks.
Yeah, that old guy was
pretty pissed off.
Look, guy...
Loomis is out there
looking to bust everyone.
I mean, losing oggie
ain't no big deal,
and that's a hell
of a car you got there.
Buddy, I'd put
that kidney Buster down
This place is filled with
ether and acetylene, dig?
No!
Hey!
I don't know what
your problem is, guy, but...
hey!
I'm out of here!
Aah!
Keep going, man!
Holy shit!
No!
Where'd he go?
Skank, you pussy!
Skank!
Yeah?
Who is that guy?
But whoever he was,
he's weird
and pissed off.
[Whimpering]
Red?
Yeah?
Loomis here.
Hey, loomis.
This is a real strange
place you got here.
Really unique in its
depressing qualities, huh?
What do you need?
[Spits] Bingo.
You got a couple of
cockroaches working here.
I need a word with them.
My nephew skank
and his pal gutterboy?
Over there.
Thanks.
Cleared for take off.
[Whimpering]
Morning, fellas.
Yo, skank!
This is a nice place
you got out here.
Skank, a little help here?
Been working here long?
Man, I smell a cop!
Do you smell a cop?
I smell French fries, skank.
But that don't make
no sense, huh?
Bud, you got a warrant?
I don't need a warrant
when I have this badge.
But we know our
constipational rights, sir.
You can't just
come in here and...
oh, wow!
[Whimpering]
I got this problem, fellas.
Oggie fisher, your buddy
who got greased?
I want to know who was
driving the car
that ran him into kingdome come.
Nobody's seen
that guy before, it's...
you hit me in the head
again, skank.
I'm telling ya...
ok.
I can't remember dog squeeze
when it comes to getting
run off of roads there, loomis.
I can see why, skank.
I can call you skank, can't I?
Yeah, unless you
like Maurice better.
[Both laugh]
[Laughs]
Well, you listen good, skank.
I know it's gonna be hard
with your melon
on chemical overload.
But there's a killer out there,
and I'm gonna track
the hair ball down,
so when you 2 craterheads
get finished mining
for nose gold,
and you get a relapse of memory,
you let me know, huh?
I'm just a phone call away.
We ain't got no

No!

Hey, asshole, come here.
Come here.
Skank, you look like shit.
Why are you walking?
Had a little problem
with the 'cuda, packard.
Kid on a bike just came by here.
Not a motorbike with keri
on it or nothin', pack...
you're pissing me off.
Get in.
Holy shit!
It's that kid!
Aah!
Uhh!
What the hell's
going on here, pack?
You ok?
Kill him.
What?
Where the hell is he?
Right there.
Do it!
Eat hot lead,
crud-sucker!
Ha ha ha!
Uhh!
What the hell
is that thing, man?
He did something
to the damn gun!
He ain't no human, pack!
Bullshit!
He's a kid!
Just a kid.
Hey, chickenshit,
come on out of there!
Let's get the hell out of here.
I heard that.
[Engine starts]
Loomis, what the hell
are you doing here?
You got a minute?
You gotta be out of your mind,
barging in here like this.
I got this problem...
Downtown.
I'm not going anywhere, guy.

On your feet, buddy, now!
Ooh, that sounds important.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
See you in the squad car.
Thanks.

I couldn't sleep

I had strange dreams.
What kind of dreams?
I dreamed that
the man in the moon
was laughing at me.
He tends to laugh all the time.
Did you ever notice that?
Then I was headed east
on the back of a motorcycle,
and the driver
was Jamie Hankins.
What's strange is
that Jamie's dead.
Yeah, I know.
Billy told me.
You know,
Jamie was a lot like you.
That could account
for the dream, I guess.
I like you.

Sheriff's office.
It's Murphy.
He's at home.
Loomis: Tell him
I'll call him back.
He'll call you right back.
Ain't you got any
air in this joint?
And your friend minty?
Well, he was maggot pie
before the car exploded.
Excuse me.
Um, is it true that his eyeballs
was all sucked out of his
sockets and everything?
Yeah.
It was just like oggie,
not a mark on him.
We pulled the poor bastard
from the fire
cold in his own sauce.
Almost gives me the willies
just talking about it.
[Whimpering]
So, before I nail
you bastards to the wall,
I'm gonna give you
a chance to cooperate.
We'll do anything.
Packard: Hey!
Shut up!
Look, loomis,
we ain't done nothing illegal
except maybe bust a speed limit,
so why don't you
give us all a break
and let us get the
hell out of here?
You listen to me,
you son of a bitch,
there's a kid out there
using his car to kill people,
not that it's such a big deal
since it seems to be your gang
he's got it in for.
So, if you guys
try to take the law
into your own hands,
and that killer turns up dead,
I'm gonna see you
all sniffing cyanide...
In the Arizona gas chamber.
Do you read?
[Whimpering]
Here we are.
I'll stop by and
pick you up later.
Ok.
today was the nicest day
I've had in a long time.
I thought so, too.
I'll see you.
Bye.

I'd quit, too.
Well, I ain't got no beef
Yeah, he's just a damn kid, man!
Packard said so.
Rughead:
I'm leaving!
Too bad!
Slosh this pig with 15, bud.
Let's go cruise.
Scare up some poozle some place.
You got it, skanko,
'cause I'm
a 4-day virgin.
Rughead must have
forgot something.
[Both screaming]
[Siren]
[Gasping]
Kind of a mess now,
don't you think?
The gutterboy and skank...
They were... they were
right there.
And it's like they vaporized!
They were adiosed
by the kid in the turbo.
I warned 'em!
I warned 'em!
What are you trying to say, boy?
[Coughs]
That skank and gutterboy
were in there
when the place blew.
[Crying]
I know it seems impossible.
I didn't know they had
a kid in the car.
I didn't know
it was Jamie hankins
till he came up missing.
So, what you're telling me
is that packard and the others
killed Jamie hankins?
Jamie hankins was
here the other night
with a shotgun!
A dead kid with a shotgun?
I seen his eyes, loomis.
I seen his eyes...
And I got a real bad feeling.
Bad feelings don't add up
to resurrections, buddy.
[Crying]
If it was Jamie hankins,
why'd they kill him off
in the first place?
I've been too scared
to say nothin'.
Packard hated Jamie.
Packard hates everybody.
He hates me.
I don't wanna get killed
over something I had
nothing to do with.
Not now.
[Sobbing]
You go on home now and...
You stay there till you
hear from me, eh?
Girl: Hey, Billy.
Ok, I want 2 dogs.
I want 3, uh, onion rings.
Yeah, 3 orders of onion rings,
and 2 hamburgers, no cheese.
And 2 malteds, vanilla
and chocolate, ok?
How you doing, kid?
I'm officer loomis.
Can I have a word with you?
What do you need?
I'm swamped.
I need some information...
About your brother.
That's easy.
He's dead.
Order up!
Yeah, I know.
But, um...
and now I've got
4 dead kids in one week.
4?
I thought it was 2.
Skank and gutterboy
got lunched
out at the warehouse.
[Clicks tongue]
I figure packard Walsh is next.
I'll shake the hand
of the guys who does it.
Order up!
It might be, um...
Impossible.
Did your, uh...
Brother have a girl?
Well, the night he was killed,
he was with keri Johnson.
Somebody busted in
and smashed her head.
She woke up the next day
on a deserted highway somewhere
wrapped in a navajo blanket.
Does she have any idea
who did it?
Uh, drifters maybe?
Maybe smugglers?
Maybe packard Walsh?
Who knows?
She never knew who did it,
or she would have said so.
Keri Johnson, huh?
I need some more relish
over here.
Thanks.
Order up.
Hey, uh, officer?
What's my brother have
to do with 4 dead guys?
I mean, what's the connection?
That's what I'm gonna find out.

There you go.
Here you go.
Anything else?
Yeah, could I have a...
I can't talk now, packard.
the past couple of days.
You've been real busy.
Would you get out
of here? I have to work.
Nope.
What are you doing?
Packard, stop it!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Packard, what the hell
are you doing, man?
You'll wind up dead
like your brother.
Uhh!
[Groans]
Oh!
[Groaning]
[Engine starts]
Billy.
[Tires squeal]
You bastard chickenshits!
You let him take her!
So where are we going?
Somewhere no one
will ever find us.
Where's that, packard?
West.
California.
To Santa Barbara
or some place like that.
I'm not going.
Yes, you are, keri.
Remember that night
when you guys found me
with Jamie henkins?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
Well, think.
and we had just
finished doing it.
[Gasps]
So it was you.
Yeah.
I was always with Jamie.
I never made
any promises to you.
You're mine, that's it.
You think I'd go
to California with you?
I'd rather go to Nogales,
have the gutterboy's
cretin children,
and die than to be with you.
You better shut up now, keri,
yeah, you can
kill me, too, packard,
but you can never
make me love you.
Packard, you're pathetic.
You wanna race?
'Cause I'll show you a race!
We'll finish this later.
[Tires squealing]
[Tires squealing]
[Tires squealing]
We got 'em, loomis.
We're in pursuit, over.
All units, we're on diamondback.
request all addition units
in the vicinity.
We have a suspect heading
westbound on Ridge road.
Man: Dispatch, we're
in high-speed pursuit
of silver corvette,
red trim and that black turbo.
Uh, Roger, unit 64,
give us your location
again. Go ahead.
Come in, loomis.
North on diamondback road.
Uh, Roger that, 16.
North on diamondback.
[Motor revs]
[Truck horn honks]
Oh, shit!
[Explosion]
[Siren]
My God.
Just like all the others.
Loomis, there's only
one body here.
Cover him up.
You want us to set up
a new road block?
We could still catch the bugger.
Got guys waiting...
forget it, Murphy.
Roadblocks won't stop
something that can't be stopped.
Loomis, what are you saying?
I'm saying it's over.
There's nobody left
in packard's gang to kill.
Let's clean this mess up
and get the hell out of here.
[Engine stops]
[Whirring]
[Gasps]
[Exhales]
I can't do that again.
Jake.
You know who I am.
Jamie.
It's as close as I could come
to who I once was.
It's close enough.
Just think of this
as a second chance.
We were meant to be
together, keri.
Look, I got one
more thing to do.
Don't leave me again.
Don't worry.
I'll be back.
It's a short trip.
Pack light.
[Engine revs]
Come on, packard!
Relax.
You scared me, man!
I'm sorry, man.
It's been a heavy day already.
I can see that.
It's time for me
to hit the road.
My business here is finished.
Before I do,
I want you to have something.
She's yours now.
Who's mine?
It's outside.
Turbo interceptor.
The only one in existence.
Does very special things.
Take care of it, will you?
Who are you, bro?
You said it, Billy.
I gotta go.
Hey, man, wait a minute!
Where you going?
Where you going?!
The instructions are in
the glove compartment!
Wait a minute!
Come back!
Come back, bro!
Whoa.
Ha ha!
Whoa!
Hey, man, far out.
Hey, Jake! Who are you?
It couldn't have been.
Jake!
Jake!
Jamie!
