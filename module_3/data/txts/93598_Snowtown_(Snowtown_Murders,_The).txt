<i>[MAN ON TV]: I don't wanna boast,

[JOHN]:
You keeping an eye on him for me?
<i>[SUZANNE]:
Yeah, of course I am, John.</i>
<i>Don't worry about him.
He's harmless.</i>
[JOHN]:
You know that's not true, love.
[SUZANNE]: Well why?
What have you heard?
That he's been down the school again,
flashing himself.
[SUZANNE CHUCKLES]:
I haven't heard nothing like that.
<i>Seems okay. He's very quiet,
keeps to himself.</i>
I don't mind.
Here, have something to eat.
You look all tense.
Oh, thanks love.
Don't worry about him.
Turn around.

[GAVIN]:
I've had some fuckin' women, but...
<i>it's been a while since
I've actually had some true love.</i>
<i>Mate, do you know,</i>
<i>I don't know if you've felt
it before but...</i>
<i>the last romantic thing I can
remember doing, bro,</i>
<i>you know, like I say,
it's been a while,</i>
and I wined and dined her, you know,
did the whole nine yard thing.
Hmm...
<i>I booked a hotel on
Glen Osmond Road,</i>
took her to a hotel- I think it's
called Eagle On The Hill, right?
<i>It's a real classy
restaurant dude, right?</i>
Cost me hundreds of dollars
obviously to pay for it.
<i>But she was worth it, mate.</i>
She was beautiful,
you know what I mean?
- I loved her.
- Yeah, I know.
Yeah, wined and dined her,
you know what I mean?
And afterwards, I think it's called
Windy Point, or whatever it is.
- It's a lookout, right?
- Up in the hills?
<i>Up in the hills, alright?</i>
Which was beautiful,
know what I mean?
Got into each other a little bid,
got a little bit heated,
you know what I mean?
But in that loving, caring,
sort of...
- nurturing feeling way.
- Yeah, yeah.
And, um...
<i>And took her back to the hotel room,</i>
and you know,
it wasn't... it wasn't fucking,
you know, and see you later.
<i>There was something more to it,
you know?</i>
<i>Substance, mate. Substance.</i>
I miss it.
[GAVIN]: So what's he gonna do
with this now?
[LIGHTER CLICKS, GURGLING]
