Six times three.
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
Hurry up.
It's eighteen. Ooh!
Ring the bell three times,
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.
Commence! You don't make it,
you do it again!
You ever been tested this hard ever in your life?
Never.
Winning here is a conscious decision.
Make up your mind if you want to pass
or choose to fail.
All right now, gentlemen,
I'm gonna introduce y'all
to something called
"not being able to breathe".
Andrew! Come back.
Come back to the light.
All this shaking and all this cold.
Harness it.
Turn it into aggression.
You just proved to your bodies,
through your mind,
that you can push yourself
further than you thought possible.
Go get wet! Run!
I'm at my limit, so...
...that's it.
- You sure you want to be here?
- Yes, I do.
Are you absolutely sure?
I'm positive!
Whatever you have to do!
Just find an excuse to win.
Keep going.
It pays to be a winner!
I like having my buddies that I can depend on.
And I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.
These guys are our band of brothers.
@Silent night@
@Holy night@
@All is calm@
@All is bright@
There's a storm inside of us.
I've heard many team guys speak of this.
A burning.
A river.
A drive.
An unrelenting desire to push yourself
harder and further
than anyone could think possible.
Pushing ourselves into those cold,
dark corners.
Where the bad things live.
Where the bad things fight.
We wanted that Fight at the highest volume.
Aloud fight.
The loudest, coldest, darkest,
most unpleasant of the unpleasant fights.
Is this doable?
It's expensive.
How much?
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.
I know.
How much?
I'll find out. Expensive.
You're fucked, man.
I know.
I'm up.
Going down.
Murphy by 1.1.
More than that. More than that, Marcus.
Fucking dude, I was being generous.
Trust me.
Who won?
Murph. Murph, barely. By one second.
Barely.
Barely. Head shave?
- Head shave or what?
- I don't know, you know? It's something to think about.
If I shave his head, I have to focus on his face.
Face, ears. Oddly shaped head.
Well, I don't wanna be looking at him
that close, either,
- but he has been running his mouth about beating you.
- Really?
Fuck, a head shave is fair.
- Axe?
- Better shave him.
Make him go eat with the E- 3s,
work in the chow hall until it grows back.
Frankie, what do you think?
Why the fuck wouldn't we shave him?
That's valid.
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?
Let me see you make a tactical
decision right now.
Well, I could go both ways on this.
He did lose, but he was close.
And you're Mike Murphy.
You are Mike Murphy.
The Mike Murphy.
I would've expected a bigger separation.
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.
Patton. Grab my razor.
Razor, copy that.
Listen up.
Red Wings' a go. Tonight, 18:00.
Beautiful.
Am I going?
PLO in an hour.
Maybe I'll go.
It's a maybe. I'll give you a maybe.
Stay optimistic.
Boys. Hey, what's up?
What the fuck am I doing wrong?
Oh, come on.
I'll tell you what,
Shane, here's your first op.
You ready?
Clean all this up.
The objective of this mission
is to capture and kill Ahmad Shah.
Bad guy. Senior Taliban commander
responsible for killing Marines
in eastern Afghanistan.
A Tier I target.
If you want a positive I.D.,
note that Shah has no earlobes.
Taraq.
His right-hand man.
Seems to do most of his chief shit for him.
We're going in with a four-man recon team.
Axelson, you'll be point. Myself,
I'll be second.
Dietz, comms. Marcus, rear, med.
Axe, give us our route.
We're gonna be moving up
the back side of this mountain here,
which is gonna offer great concealment
from the village.
I'm estimating that it's gonna take us between
three and four hours,
depending upon the gradient of the terrain
which is that crappy shale.
So please lace up.
First things first. You're gonna win the fight.
No medicine in a gun fight.
Two weeks ago,
Team 8 was near where we're gonna be.
Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake.
Contrary to popular belief, there is poison oak,
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.
Murph's got the satphone.
The angle ofthis region is very steep.
Expect typical comms problems.
We're gonna be on two-hour comms windows.
If we miss two windows,
I'd say wake somebody up. If not, don't sweat it.
Waypoint one is Budweiser.
Waypoint two is Miller.
Three is Corona. Four is Heineken.
And for our O.P. 1, Schlitz Malt Liquor.
And if and when we I.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.
Gentlemen, these are your Rules of Engagement.
US forces will comply
with the Law oF Armed Conflict at all times.
Use of deadly force is authorized.
Allahu Akbar!
If you do come under attack,
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.
Leaving here at 18:00.
Two Chinooks and two Apaches.
We fly here to the L.Z.,
insert the four-man team right here.
Then we fly 30 minutes to J-Bad.
Here, we'll have 15 team guys
and about a dozen Marines standing by all night.
When we hear "Schlitz Malt Liquor",
we're heading back
to Bagram for phase two.
The QRF will stay here at J-Bad.
Now the Apaches stay with the Black Hawks.
The movement is so we can get the 47's back here
ready to bring up to phrase two,
once you get eyes on Shah.
Oh,
I bringing up tomorrow night's
new guy presentation to 14:00 today,
so that all may revel and partake.
You better be good, Napoleon.
Fuck.
A lot of moving parts.
We were going to wait and
then she gets her head into it
and when she gets her head into
something, that's it.
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.
You know, you should just let her do it.
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.
He's afraid of losing control over his castle.
He's having control issues 'cause he's the one
who's always made
the taste decisions in the family, right?
No, she's got great taste. I...I trust her.
Well, what does she like?
Rose Honeydew.
Oh. Is that a color?
- Mmm?        - mmm.
You better control that situation.
It's very ongoing.
New grass leads to new bushes by the windows,
leads to new curtains, leads to new sofa,
leads to new carpet, leads to new floor.
New baby.
- Dude, she's pregnant?
- How far along is she?
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
No, she's not pregnant.
She's just on a weird journey,
moving through the house,
one room to the next.
- Sounds expensive.
- Sounds pregnant.
Congratulations.
You're fucking late.
Sir, I'm good to go.
No.
You should introduce yourself
and tell us something about you we don't know.
All right. Petty Officer...
Oh, shut up!
Get out!
Shut the fuck up!
Hey. Settle down.
Give the kid a chance.
Remember what it was like for you.
Petty Officer...
Who gives a shit!
Shut the fuck up!
Mr.Patton, please.
There we go.
More neck.
Come on, dude, you got to get into it.
Lose yourself.
Yeah!
Whoa!
Whoo!
Really, really bad.
Dude, that was traumatizing.
Can we vote to push him through?
Because I can't see that ever again.
- Hands up.
- Push him through!
I don't know. Can he say it?
- Can you say it?
- Prove it!
I don't want to watch you dance again.
I really don't.
Can you say it, Mr.Patton?
I can say it, I can say it.
Uh...Don't fuck it up.
Come on. No more fucking around. Come on.
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.
Seen two whales fuck.
Been to three world fairs.
I even know a man in
Thailand with a wooden cock.
I push more peter more sweeter
and more completer
than any other peter pusher around.
I'm a hard bodied,hairy chested,
rooting tooting shooting,paracg huting
demolition double-cap crimping frogman.
There ain't nothing I can't do.
No sky too high, no sea too rough,
no muFF too tough.
Learned a lot of lessons in my life.
Never shoot a large caliber man with a small
caliber bullet.
Drive all kinds of trucks.
Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.
And those big motherfuckers that bend and go,
"sshh-sshh"
when you step on the brakes.
Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing.
Moderation is for cowards.
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver.
I'll wine, dine, intertwine,
and sneak out the back door when
the refueling is done.
So if you're feeling froggy,
then you better jump,
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.
Cheers, boys.
She does not need an Arabian horse!
How the fuck do you know about that?
I know everything, Murphy.
More a Tennessee Walker cross stallion.
The original Silver. The Lone Ranger's horse.
No shit.
Glorious horse, Murphy. Glorious!

Call in Rick James.
Fuck,yeah.
Axe, you sexy in there? You comfy?
Solid.Advise on target.
Danny, you make comms yet?
No joy.
Fuck.
We're too exposed.
What do you think? Keep Axe at O.P.1?
Move back twenty-five yards,
set up O.P.2?
Roger that.
Axe, you're on surveillance.
Dietz, fall back to O.P. 2
and get me some fucking comms.
Spartan Base, this is Spartan 0-1.
Radio check. How copy?
Hey, L.T.
Yeah.
If we're home by the 15th, me and Morgan
are gonna cut down all the trees around the stable.
How is that gonna help me?
Hello?
Braham's horse auction is, I think, the 27th.
That means if I cut down the trees behind the stable,
I get a discount for your horse.
Do they sell Arabic horses?
First of all, it's not an Arabic horse, okay?
It's an Arabian horse.
Arabic.
It's...You're from New York, okay?
- How much is an Arabic horse?
- It's Arabian horse.
How much is an Arabian horse?
No less than 15 grand.
Fifteen fucking grand?
Hell of a wedding present.
Is that redhead a bridesmaid?
Radio check.How copy?
- Melissa?
- The redhead, dude.
The one with freckles on her nose.
The cute one from the Coldplay concert.
That's Melissa.
- Is she coming?
- She's a bridesmaid.
Yeah. Is she coming?
She's a bridesmaid. Yes.
- Did she ask about me?
- No.
Mikey, I'm good here.
I'm going to break down O.P.1.
Copy that.
Listen up. At 09:30,
we move to high ground and make comms.
Marcus, Axe, shut her down.
Dietz, you got security.
Rest up, gents.
Can you get off the radio while you're chewing?
You're making me nauseous.
Mikey, you see this?
What the fuck is this?
Oh, shit.
Get down!
Down!
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Get up.
Get your hands back.
Spartan Base, Spartan 0-1.
Stepped right the fuck on me.
What the fuck is this? What the fuck?
Are you talking to Taliban?
Fucking Tali.
Saying again. This is Spartan 0-1.Over.
Come on. Come on.
Hey, eyes down. Eyes down.
Eyes down. Eyes down.
Mother fuck.
Axe. Eyes on him, what he does.
Fuck.
Spartan Base, this is Spartan 0-1. Over.
Danny, your radio working?
So now I'm going to be that guy
calling on an unsecure sat line
because your shit ain't functioning.
Talk to the mountain, sir.
Eyes down. Eyes down.
Motherfuck.
You know, it's feeling like a cursed op.
It's not a cursed op. There's no curses.
It's just Afghanistan. That's all.
J-Bad TOC, Sergeant Hasslert speaking.
Sergeant, this is Spartan 0-1.
Do you hear me?
Hello.
Sergeant, this is Spartan 0-1.
Yes, yes, I can hear you, sir.
I am calling on an unsecure line.
I need to speak to the C.O. immediately.
- The C.O.?
- That's correct.
Which C.O., sir?
Commander Kristensen.
Commander Kristensen isn't here,sir.
Ah, he's at Bagram.
Yes, that's correct, sir.
I need you to transfer
me to Bagram Ouellette TOC.
Now.
Roger that, sir. Stand by.
Ouellette. Petty Officer Patton.
Patton, Mike Murphy.
You're looking for Mike Murphy?
This is Mike Murphy. Do you copy?
Mike?
This connection sucks. What's up, man?
Patton, get me the Skipper now.
He's sleeping, sir.
Wake him the fuck up.
Did you say wake him up, sir?
Right fucking now.
Roger that.
Murph wants me to wake the Skipper.
- Mike Murphy?
- Yeah.
That's Mike Murphy? Well, go get him.
Commander Kristensen?
Commander Kristensen?
Sir, sorry, sir.
I got Lieutenant Murphy on
the phone for you in the TOC.
He says he needs to talk to you now.
Which one?
Right there.
Mike? Mike?
Oh, it dropped.
Mike?
It's dead. What did he say?
Uh, just that he needed to talk to you.
Why is Murphy calling on a satphone?
No idea.
Are we having comms
problems with Spartan 0-1?
We were good for a while,
but we've missed two windows now, sir.
Two.
Try him back! For fuck's sake.
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.
Well, we could light the goats on fire,
smoke signal our way out of here.
Yeah, I could walk down to the village,
ask to borrow a phone.
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.
Afghan Dirt Brown, Goat Skin Blond.
Shit, they'll dig that a hell of a lot more than,
what is it, fucking Honey Cream?
Sit down. Sit down!
Way I see it, we got three options.
One, we let them go, hike up.
We'll probably be found in less than an hour.
Two, we tie them up, hike out, roll the dice.
They'll probably be eaten by fucking wolves,
or freeze to death.
Three?
We terminate the compromise.
Shah's down there. We let them go,
we're letting him go. Mission fails.
No, Mikey.
I don't like it. I don't fucking like it at all.
What are we gonna do?
We gonna kill them? Huh?
Okay, we kill them, right?
What, then what? Fucking bury them?
They get found, then what?
Then what?
What do you mean, then what?
And then what?
You know then what.
What do you think?
This shit's gonna be private?
Huh? It's gonna be out there for
the whole fucking world.
CNN, okay? "SEALs kill kids."
That's the fucking story forever.
It's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.
We do what we do. What we have to do.
This is the fucking Navy
and you're the fucking boss,
so you make the fucking call, sir.
Shah killed 20 Marines last week.
Twenty.
We let him go, 20 more will die next week.
Forty more the week after that.
Our job is to stop Shah.
Why do these men have
the right to dictate how we do our job?
Rules of Engagement says we cannot touch them.
I understand.
And I don't care.
I care about you. I care about you.
I care about you. I care about you.
I don't want your Mom seeing your head,
your decapitated head on Al Jazeera.
That is Shah.
I don't see it that way.
Where do you think he's running to?
200 friends down there.
Got guys in Leavenworth doing
20 for taking home trophy guns.
What do you think they're gonna do
for two fucking kids and an old fucking man?
Fucking look at them, man.
They fucking hate us.
Look at him. That's not a kid,
that's a soldier. That's death. Look at death.
- We can't do it.
- Look at that soldier.
They are unarmed prisoners.
And the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.
Tie them up.
Tie them up. Let's get the fuck out of here.
We can't just fucking leave them, let them go!
I thought you were standing by waiting
for your fucking orders?
I am standing by waiting for my fucking orders.
What do you think that radio's for?
They're not calling Domino's Pizza.
I know what the fucking radio's for.
That radio's fucking Tali.
It's a cell phone to the Taliban.
So you just think it'll just be our little secret? Huh?
That's a warrior.
Schwack them.
We cannot do that.
This is a soft compromise.
You want to go to Leavenworth?
You don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.
Don't let him influence you.
Marcus, I'm just saying, you can't just say...
Look at that child.
Make up your fucking mind
and don't let him influence you.
Schwack them.
Mikey, it's your fucking call.
I ain't fucking voting.
This is not a vote.
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.
So we're going to pack up everything.
We're gonna cut them loose
and we're gonna make this peak.
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.
When we get these comms up,
we're gonna call for extract and we're going home.
Roger that, sir.
- Roger that.
- Roger.
Spartan 0-1. Spartan 0-1, do you copy?

We're QRF!
We have troops in contact!
But we're fucking QRF!
We're going! We have TIC!
What the fuck is with the Apaches?
Troops in contact.
Limited resources, Chief.
There ain't enough Apaches.
That's fucked up.
They'll be back.
Hey. Hey.
You just won the lottery.
Any station, listen up.
Please relay to Spartan 0-1.
Spartan to base, do you copy?
Spartan 0-1,
Spartan 0-1 to base, do you copy?
Fuck.
Oh, fuck!
False summit.
- Fuck!      - Yeah.
Danny, get me some comms.
Come on. Spartan Base,
this is Spartan 0-1. Over.
What do you want to do?
Go home. Get in bed, watch Anchorman.
Yeah, roger that. What do you think?
I think we did the right thing.
I think we let our love light shine.
Fuck me!
I mean, isn't that how things work?
Good things happen to good people?
This is a bad spot.
Danny, I got nothing here on sat.
Give me something.
I don't have fucking shit.
How do you feel?
This is a bad spot.
You okay?
All set.
Good. Let's fall back to that tree line.
Wait till sundown.
If we can't make comms,
we're walking home anyways, gents.
Let's get some rest.
Pack up, let's move.
Fuck.
Spartan 0-1, Spartan to base,
do you copy?
Spartan 0-1, radio check, do you copy?
Sir, they've now missed three windows.
Okay.
Commander Shriver,
there's a call for you on line 17.
Roger.
Commander Shriver.
Uh, sir, this is Erik.
For your S.A., we have missed
three comm windows with Spartan 0-1.
Last known comms were at 07:00.
Why am I hearing this from you right now?
Sir, we expected
to have some comms problems.
Murphy and I discussed
and agreed that we would not start a spin
until after he missed two windows.
Is there a fucking problem here, Erik?
Sir, I've told you everything I have at this point.
I will call you when I have more information.
This is Commander Kristensen out.
Fuck.
I'm going to do some recon.
Be back in two minutes.
- You want some company?
- Negative.
I'm going to do about two minutes of recon.
Be right back.
We're about to get contacted.
How fucking fast are these guys?
Fast.
What are you thinking?
I'm thinking we're about getting fixing
to get into a pretty good gun fight.
Copy that.
Looks like I voted wrong.
Negative.
We just got the opportunity
to make hell fucking strong contact
with our friend from the other side.
Job well done.
Hoo-yah to that, sir.
Danny, get ready to fight.
Hey, Mikey...
I'm about ready to punch that timecard.
Do it.
Push left! Marcus, move!
Moving!
Motherfucker.
Spartan Base, this is Spartan 0-1.
Request immediate QRF! Troops in contact!
Fuck! Fuck.
Fucking shit! Motherfuck!
Motherfucker!
Allahu Akbar!
Contact, twelve o'clock!
Axe?
Yeah.
Mikey. Left is good.
I say again, left is good.
Mikey!
Left is not good! I say again, left is not good!
Roger that! Push right!
We are good right.
Push right. Push right.
Push right.
Murph, down!
Goddamn motherfuckers!
Fuck you!
Smoke out!
Hey! Consolidate on Mikey!
Shit! Fuck!
Right is no good! Right is no good!
Move!
Back! Back!
First man!
Mikey! Consolidate on me!
Fuck.
I think we can take them,
Mikey, but we're gonna need a new spot!
Roger that! Danny, comms!
Negative! Radio's down hard,
it took some rounds!
- You got crypto?
- Yeah!
Gas the fucking radio, we're moving!
Roger that!
Shit!
Ow, fuck!
Ow! Fuck!
Marcus, on me!
Fuck!
We're falling back!
You mean fall off?
Yeah! Fuck!
Axe!
Axe, on me!
Ready? Move it!
- Ready?
- Roger!
Go, go, go!
Jesus.
Shit.
Oh, my God.
Fuck.
I lost my rifle.
My rifle. My...
Shit.
You see? God's looking out for us.
If that's God looking out for us,
I'd hate to see him pissed.
Oh, God...thank you, thank you!
Where's Axe?
That sucked.
They fuck...They fucking shot me.
Living in the past, Danny.
We're all shot, bro. Can you fight?
Messed up my drawing hand, that pisses me off.
All right, we're good.
We just gotta get to flat ground,
then we take these motherfuckers, that's it.
Fucking foot!
Goddamn, this sucks! Oh, fuck.
Fuck you.
Fuck!
Damn! Fucking burns!
- Danny.
- I can fight.
Way to go, buddy.
Peel left! Peel left!
Last man!
Let me see it. You okay?
Give me your arm. Yeah.
Whoa. Passing to the left!
Come on down!
Danny!
Let's go.
Get them up! Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Over...
Come on.
Come on!
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Find a fucking strap.
Get him up. Get him up.
Come on. Fuck.
Get him. Get him up.
Fuck. Fuck.
I got two mags, one frag.
Hey.
Oh, man.
Hey.
Oh.
This is bad here.
Mmm.
This is a fucking problem.
Fucking no comms.
Fucking comms.
- You're okay, right?
- Shot me up pretty good, bro.
This hand, let me see.
You're all right. Look at me.
Hey, look at me.
You okay? Huh?
Suck it the fuck up, okay, Danny?
You're a fucking frogman.
Fuck, I lost my med kit.

Multiple gunshot wounds

Update ready to follow.
Say when ready to copy.
Braye men have fought and died
building the proud tradition
and fear of reputation that
I am bound to uphold.
I died up on that mountain.
- No pulse.
- Okay, start CPR.
One, two, three...
There is no question
a part of me will forever be
up on that mountain, dead...
As my brothers died.
But there is a part of me that lived
because of my brothers.
Because of them, I am still alive.
And I can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,
how dark it gets, or how far you fall...
Hey, Luttrell. Luttrell!
We got a pulse.
...you are never out of the fight.
