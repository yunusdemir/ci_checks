<i>I am out of this world.</i>
<i>How else can I explain
how strange I feel</i>
<i>on this planet and in my skin?</i>
<i>My body is a costume,
I cannot take off.</i>
<i>I must have landed here
from Venus.</i>
Hey! Kid!
Excuse me!
Excuse me, stalker boy.
Yeah... Hi, I've seen you
following me around
for the past couple of days,
and it's super creepy
and super weird.
Could you just tell me
who the hell you are
and what the hell you want?
Um...
You're Sid Gill?
Yeah.
You dated my mom, right?
Kirsten Lewis?
Yeah.
Um...
Well, you're my dad.
Wait, what?
How was school?
I got an A in math.
What was that?
Nothing.
The school play is next week.
All the parents will be there.
- What day?
- Friday.
Okay, we'll be there.
I have to be at the site.
Can't you find a replacement?
I doubt it.
There's still time.
Yeah, that's not the issue.
What's the issue?
Well, the cement guy...
I said parents.
He's not my dad.
Just drop it.
<i>What's the matter?
Aren't you going to eat?</i>
I made it myself.
Thanks, Ma, but I'm watching
my weight a bit these days.
Watching your weight?
Men don't diet.
<i>Why not?</i>
You're a special case.
Special case? What do you mean
special case?
I mean, you're a special case.
<i>What are you doing?</i>
Too much sugar.
You're ruining my cake.
I spent hours making
those swirly designs.
<i>Swirly designs?</i>
<i>Deadly designs.</i>
What do you mean deadly designs?
Do I look dead to you?
Ma, Papaji, can we please
stop bickering about the cake?
Sweetie, forget about Daniel.
Let me set you up
with a nice girl, huh?
Why not a guy?
Ma, how about you set me up
with a nice guy?
You know how I feel
about the gay things,
and you are not a girl, okay?
You want to spend your whole
life alone?

Hello, Sylvia.
So...
The bitch has left the building.
<i>Damn, girl. So, where are you?</i>
I'm outside.
<i>Nooo...</i>
I am indeed.
I think the day
is going pretty well so far,
except that some guy just gave
me a really nasty look.
<i>Just keep
the blinders on, honey.</i>
<i>Put one foot after another
and never forget to breathe.</i>
Got it. Except that
I may be having
a bit of a panic attack,
but okay.
<i>Just keep walking.</i>
Okay... I'm walking.
<i>You're fabulous.</i>
I am freaking fabulous.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Look, I am still shaking.
Just a little bit though.
You know, first time
out in the open, all of this,
but it's good.
Of course, you are.
I am so proud of you.
Thank you... Thanks.
If everything goes
according to plan
I start hormones in about
three months from now.
And, oh my God,
at work today, let's just say,
If looks could kill.
Don't worry about it.
You've got this.
Yes, I do.
Oh... It's you again.
Oh, shit.
Well, that was easy.
I found my skateboard...
It was just there.
- You want to...
- Come inside?
Do you have aspirin
in your backpack?
So... How did you meet my mom?
We went to high school together.
Why did you guys break up?
That's complicated.
Uh...
We were friends
all through school
and then eventually
we started dating.
Then we began having the sex...
Wait. Way too much information.
- Okay.
- Thanks though.
You dated my mom, so does
that make you... a lesbian?
No... I'm not a lesbian.
When, uh, I knew your mom
I was still a guy, sort of, ish.
Now you're not a guy?
Correct, I am not a guy now.
Why?
Because that's not how
I feel on the inside.
I have never felt like
a guy on the inside, so...
Are you still Indian?
Um, yeah...
That's... not something
you can just...
Yeah, that's all still there.
All the Indian,
it's still there.
Well, this was really fun,
and I'm so glad
you came by unannounced,
unexpectedly.
Um, I think it's best now
if you just head home
and forget that
any of this ever happened,
because, um,
I'm not your father, so...
But you're... a transgender?
Yeah.
Are you, like, famous?
What?
My dad's transgender...
That is so cool.
<i>So, how old was the boy?</i>
<i>14 years old.</i>
<i>How long ago
did you date his mother?</i>
Almost 15 years ago.
All it takes is one little
sperm, right?
- Just one.
- Shit.
What?
I'm looking at her profile page.
Look, here is a photo
of her looking very pregnant
and she's wearing my favorite
Cher t-shirt from high school.
I've been looking
for this freaking t-shirt
for 15 years now.
Looks like the shirt found you.
Why don't you just
give her a call?
Uh oh...
I only started dating her
because I wanted to
get closer to her brother,
who I may have also
kinda sorta had sex with.
No.
I hate you.
Hey...
I picked them myself.
Ah... I can tell.
This is marinated bocconcini,
grilled courgette
with truffle oil,
and wild rice
with Persian walnuts...
and, uh, bread.
Um...
I thought you were
going to make Indian.
I don't know how to cook
Indian food.
I've actually
never even been to India.
Just because
my parents are from there
doesn't mean I know
how to cook the... whatever.
Well, there goes
my orange chicken theory.
Why don't you just dig in?
Can I have some soda?
I don't have soda.
There's filtered water
and carrot juice.
Oh, and vodka.
Are you hoping that I will
run down to the corner store
and pick up some carbonated
artificial sugar water for you?
Yeah, pretty much.
That's not gonna happen.
Look, kid,
let's just cut to chase.
You are white and scrawny;
I am brown and beautiful.
We don't look anything alike.
There is no possible way
that I could be
your biological father.
Well, I snuck into
my mom's diary
and she said
that you are my dad.
I am going to need better proof
than just some
silly high school diary.
Oh, it's not on a silly
high school diary...
it's an embarrassing
grownup diary.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
So your mom, she doesn't know
that you are here
with me right now, right?
- She'd kill me if she knew.
- Why?
Then she'd know
I snuck into her diary.
Call her up right now
and tell her where you are.
<i>Do it.</i>
I don't want to call her now.
Are you sure you're not famous?
Oh, my God, this again?
I'm going to get some vodka.
Don't you have
homework or something?
<i>It's summer,
there's no homework.</i>
Oh, right.
<i>Don't drink that soda.
It's so disgusting for you.</i>
<i>You should drink milk.</i>
Milk has hormones.
It'll give me boobs.
Right.
Okay, kid. Time to go.

Thank you.
Aren't you going to work?
Yeah, why? You want a lift?
<i>No.</i>
Well, let me know
if you want me or Max
to come get you later.
Ralph, your water bottle!
You're early,
I'm not even dressed yet.
You want me to come back later?
No, of course not.
Good.
No, please come in.
No, please,
just come in, it's fine.
Wow... Indian.
Oh...
Can you bake me cookies?
Chunky chocolate chip, please.
Awesome.
Hey, kid,
what's taking you so long?
Did you fall into the toilet
or something?
Oh, that's just great.
Listen... I am only gonna
go over this one time
so make sure
you pay close attention.
Got it?
This is not your enemy,
this is your friend.
- Friend.
- Exactly.
Like most friends, you only
want to keep her around
as long as she stays sharp
and keeps you looking
and feeling sharp.
As soon as she goes dull,
you want to get rid of her
because she just might cut you.
That's how you ended up
with those nicks on your face.
Do you know what a nick is?
- It's, uh, like a cut.
- Exactly.
That over there is gel,
and that is foam.
You should probably
use gel more often
because it moisturizes.
Moisturizes?
Yes. And then...
You do realize
you're not going to
need to know any of this stuff
for another few years, right?
No, I don't.
Yeah.
Another few years to go.
- Not at all.
- Yes, at all.
Whatever.
Kid, I would kill to have
a face as smooth as yours.
I'm not smooth...
I'm rough.
They call me rough Ralph,
you know.
It's my nickname...
on the streets.
Let's go out.
<i>I'm bored.</i>
<i>Can we?</i>
I'm bored.
You know,
it's unhealthy to stare
at a computer screen
for that long.
<i>It's bad for the physical
and psychological health.</i>
<i>People and their technology.</i>
I got to get something.
Happy one-year anniversary.
What's wrong?
<i>Let's go out.</i>
Let's go out!!
Ralph, shut up, okay? God!
Why don't you just
go out on your own?
Don't you have kids your own age
that you can hang out with?
Jesus!
Hey...
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have snapped at you.
What do your folks
think about you
hanging out with me, anyways?
You know - with your lady dad?
Well, I don't know.
Oh God, you still haven't
told them yet, have you?
Come on, you promised.
Well, why don't you?
Because you said you would.
You're the grownup, not me.
Look, kid, don't call me
a grownup, all right?
I decide when I am a grownup.
I already have a lot of things
on my plate now.
I don't need to add
growing up to the platter.
I'm going to be
transitioning, Ralph.
That's huge.
It's like going through
a second puberty, basically.
Once those hormones kick in,
watch out.
Basically, it's like you and I
are the same age.
You think they'd freak out
and not let us hang out?
Yeah, probably.
Maybe that would be
a good thing, Ralph.
I already have a life of my own.
I am young and I am single,
and I am wild... ish.
So then this penguin
jumps out of this helicopter.
It's on fire, and he says,
"Well, I guess it's Tuesday."
Oh, penguins.
- Because earlier in the joke...
- I tracked that.
- The reference.
- I caught it.
- Awesome.
- Yeah.
You can't beat
a good penguin, you know.
That's what I say.
They're everything
you want them to be, you know.
Yeah, penguins. Pretty neat.
<i>Pretty girls. Just dancing.</i>
Just dancing... Being girls.
Who would ever join...
a random group
of people dancing in the park?
I know I wouldn't.
Ralph...
Ralph, come back.
<i>You shouldn't talk
to strangers, Ralph.</i>
Leave them...
Leave them alone.
No, I'm feeling uncomfortable
right now.
Ralph, this is...
Hi.
How is everyone?
Hey.
Hey.
Wow. You look good.
Thanks.
I wasn't sure it was you.
It's me.
Yeah.
And who's this?
This is my son...
Ralph.
Yeah. Your son?
Yeah. I'm, uh, his father...
Mother.
Well, father originally,
mother currently.
We're working that part out.
Yeah, well, we should get going.
Wait, Sid?
Yeah.
It's good to see you.
Yeah.
<i>Who was that?</i>
That was nobody.
Why were you being weird?
It's complicated.
You have a boyfriend?
That's even more complicated.
Why?
Just keep walking.
Ralph!
Where the heck have you been?
At the skatepark.
I told you that already.
All this time?
Where did you get that?
What?
That sweatshirt.
Oh, it belonged to
one of the skaters.
What are you doing
in someone else's clothes?
It didn't fit the guy anymore.
Enough with the questions.
Can I go now, please?
Do you have a girlfriend?
What? No. Are you crazy?
Thou shan't repeat
thy parents sins...
And avoid creating new ones.
<i>I'm just outside.</i>
What are you, uh,
doing here this late?
I mean, isn't your new
lady friend going to be upset
that you're here
with me right now?
<i>There's no lady friend.</i>
There never was a lady friend.
But I thought...
Sid, listen.
<i>Sid, you mean everything.</i>
<i>I've ever been
with anyone like you.</i>
I just...
I just wanted to
tell you I'm... sorry.
So...
You're on hormones now?
Um... Not yet.
I'm going to be meeting with
an endocrinologist soon, though.
I go away and look what happens.
You come out as a woman
and you become a parent.
Could you, just...?
No.
- It started acting up.
- Uh huh.
You're so predictable.
It's so good.
Now you know
the real reason I came here.
Uh huh.
That and your breakfast omelets.
I have to get up really early
in the morning to get to work.
Yeah, me too.
I could drive you to work.
No. I don't want you
to go out of your way.
If we leave before rush hour
it won't take
more than 20 minutes.
Daniel, listen.
I'm in a very
different place now.
I don't want to go back.
I don't want to go back?
Sid, we can make this work.
Make this work...
What does that even mean?
Our relationship.
A real relationship.
Our relationship never stopped
feeling real to me.
I know.
Come on.
<i>Hi. Ma, Papaji, welcome.
Come on in.</i>
Or not.
Uh...
<i>Yes, I know it's a lot</i>
but you see how Ma just ran off
down the hallway?
Do you think you could
just take a deep breath,
turn around and go bring
her back, please?
<i>Thank you.</i>
Jan, wait!
Papaji,
how are we doing over there?
Awesome.
All right, cool.
Ma, here is your chai
and some sponge cake.
Do you like how
I have fixed my place?
You should hang that over there.
It will look better.
Okay...
You know what.
I think that's a great idea.
You've always had
really good taste.
Where is the golden temple
picture I gave you,
and the batik?
Uh...
Well, I had those things
at my old place
when I was still at university
and graduate school,
but they don't really go with
the layout of this place.
It's not very Indian.
Okay, great.
Got it.
I was thinking that maybe
you could help me
open this up
around the chest area.
Show me.
Right here.
It's fine in the hips
and the shoulders
but it's tight near the chest.
It's possible, but not much.
I can open this up
and it would make it
a bit more loose.
Let me try.
<i>Thanks.</i>
<i>Shopping these days, well,</i>
<i>it's a bit more challenging
finding things in my size.</i>
<i>Oh, here's another one.</i>
I got this one
in a thrift shop...
Ma?
Ma, why are you crying?
Where is my son?
I want my son.
Ma, don't be like that.
Where is he?
I'm right here...
I'm still your child.
It's not like I'm dead.
It have been better
if you were dead.
It would have been
better if you were dead!
What's going on?
I want my son back!
I want my son.
Bring him back.
<i>God, why has this
happened to me?</i>
<i>What have I done
to deserve this?</i>
<i>What have I done?</i>
<i>What have I done?</i>
By this age,
you should be married.
You should have a family.
Who will pass on our name?
It's funny that
you mentioned that, Ma...
because... I recently
learned that...
Papaji, Ma... I have a son.
What?
I know.
Surprise!
Ralph?
<i>Ralph.</i>
Is that a Punjabi name?
Uh, not so much.
Ralph.
What kind of nonsense
name is that?
I will call you Rajinder.
Rajinder?
Yes, I can see the resemblance.
You have my high cheekbones.
Sid, look, just like you.
Do you do well in school?
Um...
I guess.
You're a good boy then.
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?
<i>He's always hungry.</i>
I'm always hungry.
Guru Nanak
has finally answered my prayers.
Do you have orange chicken?
That would be phenomenal.
And Guru Nanak
has answered mine.
Mmm, that's good.
Ma, that's way too much food.
You're gonna give the kid
a heart attack.
Nonsense. The boy is hungry.
He's skin and bones.
Look at him. Skinny.
- Here, Ralph, drink this.
- Why?
Because it will help him
to digest better.
Digest water
is what he'll digest.
No, Ma. Haven't you been reading
that new parenting book?
Are you calling me a fool?
No. I'm just saying
I'm actually reading
about how to
properly raise a kid.
What? I need a book?
You are the fool
reading that book.
Rajinder! Come.
Here...
When he was your age
he had braces,
and so for one year
he didn't smile,
and when he ate
he looked like a fish.
<i>Who's that?</i>
<i>It was Halloween.</i>
For days and days he shouted,
"I want to be a cowgirl.
I want to be a cowgirl."
<i>What a headache.</i>
So finally I told him,
"Okay then, be a cowgirl."
So, I made him a costume
out of one my old saris.
She was so happy.
Ma, you just called me she.
I did not.
Yeah, you did.
You just said she.
You said, "She looked so happy."
Amran! Where did that man go?
Hey, is this my mom?
Let me see.
Oh, my gosh.
That is indeed Kirsten at my
disaster of a birthday party.
I think the only reason she came
is because she
felt sorry for me.
I was kind of a dork back then.
Back then?
Were you dating?
No, that was a few years later.
I'm pretty sure
she doesn't hate you.
I'm pretty sure she
would hate me
if she knew
I had kidnapped her son
and adopted him
into my crazy Indian family.
Yeah, that would do it.
There are three times
when I have seen her this happy.
Today, seeing Ralph,
and the day you were born.
So, what was the third?
The day she left her in-laws.
You think
she doesn't understand you.
She has been in your shoes.
She always spoke her mind.
She did what she wanted.
Sound familiar?
Thanks, Ma. Good night.
So, what do you think
of your grandparents?
They're pretty special.
Hey, I should start
exploring my Indian roots.
Yeah...
Seriously, I think you should.
Here, wait.
These are the keys to my place.
In case you need a place
to hang out or something. Okay?
Cool.
I could call you mom
if you want.
I thought you wanted a dad?
I don't care.
I just want someone nice
who at least knows I exist.
I got it.
Who are you?
Tabarnak!
Ralph! Hey, Ralph.
How are you? It's great... Hi!
<i>You two know each other, right?</i>
<i>Ralph, Daniel. Daniel, Ralph.</i>
This is such a pleasant...
You're here and I'm happy
to see you, Ralph.
<i>Come back. Ralph!</i>
Ralph. Hey! What are you doing?
I'm out here
in my underwear for you.
Come on back in.
Why is he in your place?
Daniel and I
are back together now.
He's a nice guy, you'll see.
You never told me.
Well, I'm telling you now!
So come on back in
and you two can
get to know each other better.
I thought you didn't like him.
Why are you
freaking out about this?
You're doing like my mom.
Screw you!
Ralph! Hey!
Ralph, come back!
You did not just give me
your middle finger, young man!
Hi.
Hi.
Hi Papaji. Um...
This is Daniel.
Daniel, this is my dad.
Hi, Daniel.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- And you.
- Come in.
- Thanks.
Hi, Ma. This is Daniel.
Daniel, this is my mom.
Hello, Daniel.
Mmm.
My son says...
Oh, I'll have to get used to
calling Sid my daughter.
Says you have a big family.
Yes, well,
I have one brother, Alex,
and a large extended family.
Your brother Alex -
is he also...?
Alex is getting married
this summer... to a woman.
A woman woman?
A woman like you, yeah.
How nice!
Well, this situation between
both of you is a bit sensitive.
<i>For one thing I am just getting
used to Sid as a woman,</i>
<i>and now seeing you both
as a couple.</i>
<i>So confusing.</i>
You see, I always imagined
Sid with a woman,
not as a woman.
And now that Sid has a son,
well, it's so modern!
Blender family situation,
you know.
Yes.
Actually, Ma, I think you
meant to say, 'blended' family.
- That's what I figured.
- Okay, never mind.
What do you think of Rajinder?
I'm sorry?
She's talking about Ralph.
Just go with it.
Oh, yes!
Well, I don't think Sid and I
see ourselves as his parents.
He already has a family.
Why not? He's family to me.
I'm his grandmother!
<i>Yes, yes, of course!
No, please don't get me wrong.</i>
Family is
extremely important to us.
As it should be.
Absolutely.
Uh, what I meant...
Oh! There he is!
I'll get the door.
Wait, what? Ralph is here, now?
Yes. You never bring him over,
so we told him
to come on his own.
Great... Great.
<i>Sat Sri Akal.</i>
<i>Ki hal hai, beta?</i>
That's just so nice!
- Is everything okay in here?
- Yeah.
- You're sure?
- Go, it's fine.
Mom! Come check this out.
Look, look, look!
Ah, look who's joining
the partay!
Yes, he's got moves.
You got the best deal.
What do you mean?
You got to skip
the dirty-diaper phase,
the potty training,
the temper tantrums,
blah, blah, blah,
and skipped straight ahead
to a pre-programmed,
pre-packaged teenager.
No assembly required.
No assembly.
Yeah, I guess I'm the one
needing all the assembly, right?
Don't we all?
Speaking of, how are things
with the assemblage
of Sylvia and Mira
under one roof?
How is it?
Well, there's laundry...
but it doesn't suck.
Well, there you have it.
The exciting life
of a married couple!
Hey, babe.
You didn't buy these things
for Ralph, did you?
No.
You picking him up
from the skatepark?
No.
Then how is he getting home?
Taking the bus,
like everybody else.
This stuff
is no small change, Max!
It must be worth
at least 500 bucks.
He said he's just trading things
with his friends.
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.
This is...
This is boring.
This is the best cardio
you'll ever get.
The heart is a muscle, you know.
Yeah? Well my heart's bored.
Your heart is out of shape.
That's what happens when you sit
around playing video games.
Breathe.
What about your parents, Ralph?
Don't they want to meet us?
Yeah!
My mom says she's gonna call.
<i>Hey! My boys are back!</i>
<i>I was running with you guys</i>
<i>the whole time in spirit,
really, I was.</i>
If he keeps it up,
he'll be able to run
the half marathon
by the time he's 40.
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
- Yeah.
Oh shit, I have to get ready.
Ready for what?
My brother's engagement.
Engagement...
I don't think you
had mentioned that before.
Of course, I did.
No, I mean I guess you didn't
tell me that it was today.
Oh.
So I guess you're not going
to be bringing a date with you?
Sid, it's just
a family thing, really.
Okay. Sure.
Go on, get ready.
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, go for it.
How come you guys never go out?
Eat your granola.
Oh!
God...
I thought you...
had already left.
No.
You should have at least
texted me before coming over.
Yes, definitely.
You're drunk.
I'm not drunk.
What are you doing?
I just want to feel
your real hair.
No, don't.
I'm still growing it out.
It doesn't matter, seriously.
It... It matters to me.
<i>So, did you have fun
at the engagement party?</i>
Oh, yeah.
Were there a lot of women
there for you to dance with?
- Yeah. Lots.
- Great.
I spent the night with
Aunt Marie and Sophie.
Lots of beautiful aunts
and grandmothers.
Right.
Family, you know.
Seeing my
brother getting married...
<i>I thought maybe I could too,
you know,</i>
<i>marry a woman like you.</i>
And what makes you think
a woman like me
would even want to marry
a man like you?
<i>I don't know.</i>
Would a woman like you
marry a man like me?
Okay, whatever.
You're totally drunk right now.
Right?
You never told me
Daniel was so handsome.
I can see why
you're in love with him.
He's successful, smart,
he carries himself so well.
I'm so happy you found someone.
Oh!
I bought you something.
PerkyPlum, there was a 2-for-1.
When is your surgery?
Your father and I
want to help out.
What?
Why would you
want to help out with surgery?
Why not?
Well, because that's my...
Is that the only way you would
see me as a woman woman?
Is that the only way
it would be okay with you
for me to be with a man?
Nonsense...
I never had objections.
You never
brought home anyone suitable.
Every man you brought home wa...
I've never brought home
a man before, ever.
Because you forbade it.
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.
I just want you to be happy.
No. You want you to be happy.
And? What's wrong with that?
Don't I deserve to be happy?
If you are unhappy in any way,
that's all my fault?
I never said that.
You sort of just did.
You tell me
you want to be a woman,
then you get angry
when I accept you as a woman.
I only have one child;
Tell me what you want?
I want you to accept me
as I am now.
What are you, huh? Tell me!
You can't win on a serve.
- What? What is that?
- You can't win on a serve...
- whatever.
- It's a new rule.
How are you doing?
- Good. Yourself?
- Good, thank you.
You pickin' up your kid?
Yeah. Well, my girlfriend's.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
- Me, it's my stepson.
- Oh, really?
- A lot of work.
- Oh, yeah.
Hey, Ralph!
That's mine.
Don't look so happy
to see me, man?
Hey, Ralph... Get in the truck.
Go ahead, get in the truck.
But it's not like we're really
doing anything so wrong.
No, of course not.
What we're doing is a crime.
Sid, wake up.
This isn't real, none of it is.
We're like playing house.
Daniel, calm down.
Calm down? Wha...
I can't believe
we got sucked into this.
This kid is manipulating us,
not to mention your parents.
Do they know what's going on?
I don't think so.
What do you mean?
You've let them get attached
to him already.
What happens when
he's taken away from them?
Ralph, hi.
Um...
I think we need to have a talk.
Where did you get that?
Huh?
Oh!
All right, all right...
Sid, I'm taking off now.
Hey, listen, uh...
Once this
wedding business is over
you'll come meet
my family, okay?
<i>Everyone will be more relaxed.
You know...</i>
<i>Trust me.</i>
I'll see you tonight.
Okay, bye.
<i>Once you have hmm-mm, hmm-mm...</i>
<i>just try to make it
so you're thinking</i>
<i>a higher-resonance sound.</i>
<i>So I decided I wanted
to do a voice video</i>
<i>to help with the
feminization of the voice.</i>
<i>Okay, stuff you do.
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm,</i>
<i>meow, meow, meow, meow.</i>
Meow, meow...
<i>And you want
to transition to meow -</i>
<i>meow drove all day,
meow drove all day...</i>
<i>Um, try and do that with
some of those sentences...</i>
Hey.
I'm sorry.
The party went on all night.
What are you doing?
Trying to win.
Okay, well...
I got to go to bed.
Hey, babe...
Can you just give me an idea
of how much longer you plan on
keeping us in the closet?
Because it's getting
pretty suffocating in here,
if you ask me.
Can we talk about this later?
I really need to sleep.
Why? It was
a pretty simple question.
See, I think
that's the main difference
between you and Ralph.
He is not
constantly concerning himself
with what other people
think of him.
Maybe you should be
hanging out with him.
Maybe I should.
Except that, oh yes,
he is no longer in our lives
because you decided that
he can't ever see us again.
We decided that together.
You know exactly why
he couldn't stay.
He's my son.
<i>It wasn't about him
being your son;</i>
<i>It was about
keeping his parents in the dark.</i>
You would know all about
keeping parents in the dark,
wouldn't you?
Yeah, right. Well, this isn't
easy for me either, you know.
If you wanted easy,
why did you bother
coming back here?
I came back for what we were...
And now I don't know
what we are.
Hey.
Hey.
I got in a fight
with my brother.
If the guys hadn't
pulled me off,
I would have killed him.
He called me faggot.
Things got ugly, and...
I think he suspects
I'm seeing you.
However, my brother is an idiot.
It's been like this
since we were kids.
I can't do this anymore.
It's too hard.
It's like I'm two people
living this double life.
I just...
I just can't.
What are you saying?
I'm saying I'm sick of it.
I'm saying that I can't play
this stupid game anymore.
I'm done with them.
If you're sick of playing
their stupid game...
then come out...
and play with me.
Come out.
Come out, you and me, out.
Can you do that for me?
Because you know this Genie,
she ain't goin' back
in her bottle, so.
Yes.
Okay.
Oh, shit.
Yes?
Kirsten, hi.
It's me - Sid.
What are you doing here?
Um...
We really need to have a talk.
This isn't a good time.
I realize that, and I'm sorry,
but this is important.
Just go.
Hey, kid, it's me.
As I'm sure you know by now,
my little visit to your mom
didn't go very well.
But I just want you to know that
I'm going to figure it all out.
And, uh, I just wanted to check
in and say, "What's up?"
I hope you're doing good,
and I'll talk to you soon.
Okay, bye.

Hello?
Uh uh...
Ah...
What are you doing here?
Where is Sid?
Do your parents know
you're here, Ralph?
All right, screw this.
I'm calling your mom.
No, no, no!
<i>This isn't a game, you know.</i>
<i>How long do you plan to keep</i>
lying to your parents like that?
Wow, Daniel, that was delicious.
Hearing those words
coming out of your mouth.
It was special.
Sid. I'm so sorry
about what happened.
I was totally caught off guard,
and, you know, this won't
happen again, I promise you.
You're right. It's not
going to happen again
because we're done.
Sid, wait...
I just told them everything.
I told them about us!
That's so great.
I'm really happy for you.
Now get the fuck
out of my house.
Max, Ralph is not in his room.
I think he ran away.
<i>What?</i>
Yeah...
He left his phone
so I might know where he is.
<i>Come on.</i>
Where are you going?
<i>I'll explain in the car.
Come on.</i>
Go home, Ralph.
You shouldn't be here.
Go home?
I don't want to live with them.
I want to live with you.
Ralph, you need
to realize something...
I think maybe
you should have never
come looking for me
in the first place.
I think maybe your real dad...
doesn't know anything
about how to be a good parent.
You already have
two parents in your life,
and despite what you think,
they seem to be doing
a pretty good job with you,
including your stepdad.
Go home to them
and leave me alone. Okay?
- Wait here.
- Why?
Max, please.
Fine.
We could take care
of each other.
You can teach me about...
dance and design, and stuff.
I'm serious.
I... I don't want to lose you.
Because that would suck.
Oh, my God,
what are you wearing?
<i>Ralph.</i>
What are you doing here?
I told you
you're not to come here!
Huh? Answer me!
What the hell
are you doing with my boy?
Ralph, get your stuff,
we're going home.
No.
This isn't up for negotiation.
I'm not leaving.
Let's just go home
and I'll explain everything.
I'm not going home!
I'm sorry...
I know I should have
told you the truth.
But you were too young
to understand.
I really did try to
look for him, honey.
Bullshit...
You didn't try at all.
Ralph...
No.
Ohh!!
Look, kid, I think you
should listen to your mom.
She's scaring me
a little bit right now.
When I was pregnant
with you, Ralph,
I found out that your dad...
didn't feel the way
I felt about him.
He wanted to be
with someone else.
I was angry...
I was hurt.
So, I pushed him away.
Kirsten, I'm...
I'm sorry things happened
the way that they did.
<i>Ralph, your mom and I...</i>
We didn't know
what we were doing.
We were just kids, you know?
<i>Are... those your mom's?</i>
<i>Yes, they are indeed
her homemade samosas.</i>
<i>- Would you like one?
- Yes, I would.</i>
Just like old times.
Oh, my God!
This is how you lured my boy.
It helped.
How are your parents?
They're hanging in there.
<i>So, um...</i>
Some of the things
that I did back then
when you and I were...
It's mainly because
I was still figuring myself out.
I know.
Okay.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Come on.
- We'll talk soon.
- Okay.
My Rajinder! Come.
Ma?
Ma!
