Stop the Jeep, Sergeant.
What's all this, Captain?
Some entertainment
for the men, sir.
Tonight's Christmas eve.
They're moving up tonight,
General Waverly.
They should be ready
for inspection.
You're absolutely right.
There's no Christmas
in the army, Captain.
There's always a slip-up
during change in command.
The men get a little loose.
I know I'm leaving them
in good hands.
Thank you, General.
Take me to headquarters.
We'll have those men
turned out on the double.
- Sergeant, take the short cut.
- Yes, sir.
That's not the way back
to headquarters.
Joe, you know that,
and I know that,
but the general
doesn't know it.
He won't for about 11/2 hours.
That sergeant will be
a private tomorrow.
Yes. Isn't he lucky?
# I'm dreaming #
# Of a white Christmas #
#Just like the ones
I used to know #
# Where the treetops glisten #
# And children listen #
# To hear sleigh bells #
# In the snow #
# I'm dreaming #
# Of a white Christmas #
# With every
Christmas card I write #
# May your days #
# Be merry and bright #
# And may all
uour Christmases #
# Be white ##
Well, that just about
wraps it up, fellas.
Certainly too bad
General Waverly
couldn't have been here
for this yuletide clambake
because we had a slam-bang finish
cooked up for him.
Guess you know
he's being replaced
by a commanding general
fresh from the Pentagon.
Not a very nice
Christmas present
for a division
that's moving up.
The old man's
moving toward the rear,
a direction he's never
taken in his entire life.
I can only say
we owe a lot
to General Waverly...
Attention!
Captain Wallace,
who's responsible for holding
a show in this advanced area?
- Well, sir...
- It was me, sir.
My idea, sir.
When you've got
an entertainer
like Captain Wallace...
I mean, sir,
it's Christmas eve.
Well, sir, I... I mean,
if you were in New York,
uou'd pay $6.60 or $8.80
to hear someone
like Captain Wallace.
I'm well aware of
Captain Wallace's capabilities.
Who are you?
Philip Davis,
private first class, sir.
Well, at ease, Davis.
Yes, sir.
I said at ease!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
This division
is under the command
of General Harold G. Carlton.
Don't forget it,
not that he'll let you.
He's tough... Just what
this sloppy outfit needs.
You'll be standing
inspection night and day.
You may even learn
how to march.
If you don't give him
everything you've got,
I may come back
and fight for the enemy.
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
I guess all I can say is
how much I...
What a fine outfit...
How am I going...
Don't just stand there.
How do I get off?
Just happen to have
a slam-bang finish, sir.
Yes, sir.
# We'll follow the old man #
# Wherever he wants to go #
# Long as he wants to go #
# Opposite to the foe #
# We'll stay with the old man #
# Wherever he wants to stay #
# Long as he stays away
from the battle's fray #
# Because we love him #
# We love him #
# Especially when
he keeps us on the ball #
# And we'll tell
the kiddies #
# We answered duty's call #
# With the grandest
son of a soldier #
# Of them all #
# We'll stay with the old man #
# Wherever he wants to stay #
# Long as he stays away
from the battle's fray #
# Because we love him #
# We love him #
# Especially when
he keeps us on the ball #
# And we'll tell the kiddies #
# We answered duty's call #
# With the grandest
son of a soldier #
# Of them all ##
Look out!
The wall!
You all right, Davis?
I'm all right, sir.
It's just my arm.
Looks pretty bad.
Nothing but a scratch.
- Hey, Davis, how you feeling?
- Pretty good, Captain.
Just dropped by to
thank you for saving my life.
It was a life
worth saving.
I appreciate it. Anytime
I can do anything for you,
uou pick up a phone.
- Thank you, sir.
- So long, Davis.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's all right, Captain.
Captain, you could do one
tiny favor for me.
What's that?
I've written a song.
When we return home,
if you put it in your act,
it might be a big hit.
Pick up the phone.
I have it here.
This is for two people.
It's a duet.
It needs two
dynamite entertainers.
I work alone. Who's the other
hunk of dynamite?
Well, I know a fella,
Captain.
He's funny in living rooms,
has a fair voice.
- How about me?
- I do a single, you see.
Well, that's all right.
I wouldn't want you
to feel obligated.
Oh, well...
okay, Dynamite,
we'll give it a whirl.
- Okay, Captain.
- Good luck.
Bye.
# Hi-hup #

Keep it bubbling, girls.
Can I see you?
- You know Doris.
- Hi.
- Oh, fine, fine.
- Onstage, girls. Finale.
- Did you get the notice written?
- Yes, sir.
- Good boy.
- Show lays off tonight.
Everyone gets
10 days off with pay.
Nicest Christmas present
anybody ever had.
You got the tickets
for New York?
Rough for the holidays,
but I got you and Mr. Davis
are on the 1:00 train.
- Put that on the bulletin board.
- Sign this.
We'll be at Radio City
rehearsing for the Ed Harrison
Television Show.
Too bad you and Mr. Davis
couldn't get a little rest.
I wasn't about to turn this down.
This is a plug for the show.
Bring the tickets when they come.
Edna, the light of my life.
Bob!
Can I see you?
You know Doris.
Another one, huh?
How do you do?
Mutual, I'm sure.
I thought before
train time,
we'd go eat and
have some laughs.
No, we got business to do.
- What kind of business?
- Look at an act.
Some other time, I hope.
Well, I like that!
Without so much as a kiss
my foot or have an apple!
Last time I'll dig
up a date for him.
Excuse me one minute, kids.
I think it's time
we had a talk.
That's a good idea.
I'll lead off.
- Wait a minute.
- You wait a minute.
For three months
uou've been clumsily
trying to entangle me
with females.
Fat ones, tall ones,
thin ones... no matter,
as long as they're wearing skirts
and still breathing.
- It's for your own good.
- For my own good?
Face it, Bob,
uou're a lonely, miserable man.
- What?
- And you're unhappy, too.
When you're unhappy,
I'm unhappy.
I feel a strong sense of
responsibility to you.
- Ever since the day I...
- Not that lifesaving bit again.
If you'd rather forget it...
How can I? You won't let me.
Since you saved my life,
uou decided you have
the right to run it.
You've hammered,
drove, pushed, shoved,
and you look at me
with your cow eyes,
point at your phony arm,
and I melt and go along.
I don't expect
any gratitude.
We did great,
and I'm grateful.
So thank you, Phil Davis,
from the bottom of my heart.
- Now let me alone.
- I won't.
No. You're a miserable,
unhappy man.
You're wacky.
I'm very happy.
You're happy
for the wrong reasons.
That's worse than being lonely
and miserable.
You're off your nut.
I got everything I want.
Sure. I'm off my nut.
You've got everything you want,
- except the most important thing.
- What?
A girl.
I'll get around
to that soon.
When what's left of you gets
to what's left to be gotten,
what's left won't
be worth getting
whatever it is
uou got left.
I figure out what that means...
What's back of all this, anyway?
Nothing.
Only your happiness.
- My happiness?
- Yeah.
When you get an idea
that's for my happiness,
there's always
an angle for you.
- You really wanna know?
- Yes.
- I'll really tell you.
- Lay it on me.
Ever since the day we became
producers, you're a changed man.
You've gone
berserk with work.
Strange is you liked it. You liked
being Rodgers and Hammerstein.
- It was your idea.
- Sure.
I didn't think
I was creating Frankenstein.
I haven't had
one minute to myself.
What should I do?
Get married.
Have nine children.
Spend five minutes a day
with each kid, that's 45 minutes,
and I'd have time
for a massage.
You expect me to get serious
with the characters you provide?
There were nice girls.
Like that nuclear scientist
we just met?
So they didn't
go to college.
They didn't go to Smith.
She couldn't even
spell Smith.
That's very funny.
Ho ho ho!
The crooner's
becoming the comic.
Phil, let me
tell you something.
There's a lot of sense in what
uou say. I have to admit it.
But the girls we meet
in this business
are young, ambitious,
full of their own careers.
They're not interested
in marriage and a family.
I never heard you
open up like that.
Someday the right girl
will come along.
We'll get married
and have those nine kids.
Will 45 minutes be enough?
If I need more,
I'll tell you.
Come on.
Your railroad tickets.
Drawing room 8, car 207.
Grab those, Phil.
We'll go to the station
after we audition this act.
- What kind of act?
- It's a sister act.
We don't need any sister act.
We're wasting time.
They're Benny Haynes' sisters,
the old mess sergeant.
Freckle-faced Haynes,
the dog-faced boy?
- He's got sisters?
- Claims he got 'em.
How can a guy that ugly
have the nerve to have sisters?
Brave parents, I guess.
- Will you do me a favor?
- What?
Give me one reason why we
should spend our last two hours
looking at sisters
of Freckle-faced Haynes,
the dog-faced boy?
We're doing it
for an army pal.
It's not good,
but it's a reason.
Hey, Novello.
Good evening, Mr. Wallace,
Mr. Davis.
The Haynes sisters
been on yet?
They'll be on
in 15 minutes.
- Tell them we're here.
- Certainly.
Luigi, show them
to their table.
This is ridiculous.
We could have been out with Doris
and Rita having some laughs.
Girls like that
are a dime a dozen.
Don't quote prices
when I haven't got time.
- Who is it?
- It's me... Novello.
Bob Wallace and Phil Davis
are out front.
Wallace and Davis?
Your brother asked them
to give you some advice.
You better hurry.
Isn't that fabulous?
Wallace and Davis
to see us.
Yeah, fabulous.
Who'd have thought
that of Benny?
What a sweet,
wonderful guy.
Amazing.
I wonder what
gave him the idea?
He probably knew
they were in town.
He probably figured
we were too shy
to take advantage of
an army friendship.
Judy, did you read
Mother's letter?
No. Why?
Benny's been in Alaska
for three months.
Oh?
Well, he... he could've written
from Alaska.
But he didn't, did he?
Well, he might have.
Judy, why did you
write the letter?
Uh, well...
because it's good business.
You can't leave
everything to fate.
Honesty needs a little plus,
fate needs a little push.
Let's talk before you push
and plus us out of work.
You sound like mother hen
looking after little chick.
Little chick
needs looking after.
Until someone else
does it better,
mother hen's sticking close
to the coop.
- Girls, five minutes!
- Thank you.
You look beautiful.
He'll be crazy about you.
Which one?
Does it matter?
They're both famous.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Haynes sisters.
Imagine Freckle-face's
sisters being that cute.
It's incredible.
# Sisters #
# There were never
such devoted sisters #
# Never had to have
a chaperon, no, sir #
# I'm here to keep
my eye on her #
# Caring #
# Sharing #
# Every little thing
that we are wearing #
# When a certain gentleman
arrived from Rome #
# She wore the dress
and I stayed home #
# All kinds of weather #
# We stick together #
# The same
in the rain or sun #
# Two different faces #
# But in tight places #
# We think and we act as one #
Ahem.
# Those who've #
# Seen us #
# Know that not a thing
could come between us #

to split us up #
# But no one can #
# Lord help the mister #
# Who comes between
me and my sister #
# And Lord help
the sister #
# Who comes between
me and my man ##
Hey, how about
those brown eyes?
No, they're blue.
Brown.
Uh-uh. Blue.
Oh, yeah.
Deep blue.
Won't you sit down?
Won't you sit there?
You sit here.
It's cozier.
Boy, girl. Boy, girl.
I'm Betty.
This is Judy.
- You're Phil Davis and Mr. Wallace.
- Guilty on both counts.
Isn't this nice?
Mr. Wallace was just saying
it's remarkable that
Benny's sisters should have eyes...
I mean, blue eyes.
- That is, eyes...
- Nice out.
That's quite an act.
Benny never mentioned
the talent in the family.
To be honest...
Benny didn't want to take advantage
of an army friendship.
He's shy, modest, retiring.
It's a family characteristic.
- I have a recent snapshot.
- Oh.
He always was good-looking.
Uh, speaking of families,
I read an article
about citrus fruit
and its effect
on children's teeth.
Are you interested
in families or children?
- I suppose so.
- Oh, man. Nix.
Isn't that amazing?
Imagine a girl in show business
wanting to raise a family.
It's so refreshing.
Pushing. Pushing.
- How about a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
I'd like some free advice.
Do you have any suggestions
for the act?
No, just keep plugging away.
There must be something.
Should we both be blondes?
Should Betty go darker?
Should she change the style,
more off the face?
No, no. I wouldn't
change a thing.
Would you care to dance?
Shouldn't we discuss...
Let's say it with music.
Promise you won't say anything
important till I get back.
Bye now.
They look well together,
don't they?
Yes.
I was sure surprised
to get Benny's letter...
I must tell you.
You are here
under false pretenses.
Benny didn't
write the letter.
- My sister did.
- Judy?
She figured you'd come
if Benny asked.
How do you like that?
- Even Judy's got an angle.
- She didn't mean anything...
Don't apologize.
Everybody's got an angle.
That's a cynical
point of view.
Don't you know everybody's
got some larceny in them?
For the record,
we don't play angles.
- What was that letter?
- I don't like you inference.
I've got no squawks.
The kid played a percentage.
It worked.
Let's not make a whole big
mish-mosh out of it.
They're getting along.
- And so quickly.
- Isn't that nice?
When you've been
around show business,
uou get used to angles.
Since the chance of
meeting again is remote,
it's not important
to continue arguing.
I'll drink to that.
Be my guest.
If this keeps up,
we'll soon be in-laws.
I don't mind.
Too bad we're
leaving town tonight.
That is a shame.
We're leaving
tomorrow anyway.
- Where are you going?
- Vermont.
- We're booked for the holidays.
- Vermont, huh?
Vermont should be beautiful
with all that snow.
Yeah.
- You know something?
- What?
Vermont should be beautiful
with all that snow.
That's what I just said.
We're getting
a little mixed up.
Maybe it's the music.
Maybe it isn't
only the music.

What is this,
the best 2 out of 3?
I got carried away.
She carried me
right with her.
- I don't weigh much.
- We better change.
The sheriff's here
with a warrant to arrest you.
The sheriff?
What's the trouble?
The landlord claims we burned
a rug. He wants $200.
Not that old rug routine?
We sneaked our bags out.
They're in our dressing room.
You go pack.
We'll take care of this.
We can't trouble you.
- It's no trouble.
- Mr. Wallace already...
We take care of friends.
- We're practically strangers.
- We'll take care of that, too.
You might get yourself in a jam.
What's in it for you?
45 minutes to myself.
Will you hurry, girls?
- You go stall the sheriff.
- How can I?
Tell him the girls
have to finish the show.
Bob, the girls
are in a jam.
- What's the beef?
- Come on.
- Now, wait a minute.
- Come on.
Why don't we pay the $200?
Pay off a chiseling rat?
Send a cab out back.
I'll meet you in the dressing room.
Why do I listen to you?
Give me one good reason.
We're doing it
for an army pal.
- It's not good, but it's a reason.
- Will you go on?
You hop on a train.
Our tickets aren't good
until tomorrow.
You've got to
leave tonight.
Wait a minute.
Take these.
Get going.
What will Mr. Wallace think?
It was his idea.
He'll think it's some
kind of angle.
I told you it's his idea.
Now, up.
Here we go.
We'll pay you back.
Where can we reach you?
We'll be in touch.
Our trunks and recordings.
We'll get them to you.
Please go. The taxi's coming.
Don't stop for anything.
Here.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I can't stall much longer.
What about paying?
We must give them
a head start.
I've got an idea.
Stall him a few minutes.
He's eating me
out of business already.
Keep punching, will you?
This might work.
- I got a feeling I won't like it.
- I got a feeling you'll hate it.
- Then why am I doing it?
- Let's just say...
For a pal in the army.
I can't wait while
uou eat free food.
You've got your warrant.
Arrest those girls.
We agreed to let them finish.
I didn't agree.
It was his idea.
I've got rights, too.
You get them
after their number.
How long will it take?
It'll only be...
Wait a minute.
There's their music.
How's your coffee
holding out?
Warm it up some.
Ladies and gentlemen,
an impromptu surprise for you...
The Haynes sisters.

We're a smash.
Let's take a bow.
We'll be bowing
at the jailhouse.
Hey! Hey, you!
The sheriff.
- Open up!
- You've done it again.
If we get out of this...
Taxi!
Boy, girl.
Boy, girl.
Here we go.
You gentlemen
made it just in time.
You have space
on this train?
Show him the tickets.
Tickets?
Oh, tickets.
Ducats, yes.
- Hold this.
- What's the matter?
I'm looking.
Railroad tickets.
- Yeah.
- I have a...
I don't have them.
Maybe you do.
Me? Are you crazy?
I saw you put them in your pocket.
They're gone. I must have
left them in my girdle.
Do you have tickets?
We've got a drawing room.
Every space is occupied.
You can purchase tickets
and sit up in the club car.
Oh, that's fine.
How much for two to New York?
Let me see.
$97.24.
How much to Vermont?
We're going to New York.
It's beautiful in Vermont...
all that snow.
- Two to New York.
- How much more to Vermont?
- Who's going there?
- We are.
I mean, we should.
It'll do us good...
The snow, fir trees,
and clean air.
Great change of pace.
Just what we need.
- Two tickets to New York.
- It's still $97.24, though.
- Okay, buster, get it up.
- I don't seem to have any cash.
Where's that, in your snood?
Here.
- Here.
- $97.24.
- Here you are.
- Where are you going?
- It's for breakfast.
- Get some peanuts.
Club car straight ahead.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
We had reservations. They shouldn't
give it to somebody else.
With the holiday rush,
there could've been a slip-up.
Excuse me.
The club car's in there.
We pay for tickets twice.
Now we sit up all night.
If we took a plane,
we'd sit up all night.
We're not taking a plane.
We're taking a train.
We had train tickets
for a room with
two comfortable beds
where at this moment,
two blonde...
You wouldn't
do this to me.
W- wouldn't do what?
After you dressed me like a dame,
get me involved with the sheriff,
and almost killed
catching a train,
I know, I just know
on top of all that
uou wouldn't take
away my warm bed
and let me sleep in
a drafty club car.
You wouldn't do
this to old Bob.
Whatever are you talking about?
I'm going down there
to drawing room "A."
If those Haynes
sisters are there,
with these two hands, I'm...
Mr. Wallace,
how can we thank you?
You were so generous.
Mr. Davis said you insisted
on giving us the tickets.
It was just wonderful of you.
Wasn't there something you...
ahem... wanted to tell them?
Yeah... ahem.
Won't you have a drink,
sandwich, or something?
Can we have some
club sandwiches?
- I'll have lemonade.
- I'll have a malted.
This is cozy.
Boy, girl. Girl, boy.
Where are you
staying in New York?
We're not staying in New York.
We're booked for the holidays
at the Columbia Inn,
Pine Tree, Vermont.
Well... that sounds
very Vermonty.
Should be beautiful
this time of year...
all that snow,
fir trees, clean air.
Brrr. Beautiful.
Just what we need.
Could you come up
for a couple days?
I don't know.
I wish you could.
It'd be awfully nice.
If you're under
a falling building
and somebody offers to carry you
to safety, don't hesitate.
Just spit in his eye.
- What did that mean?
- Means we're going to Vermont.
Oh, boy!
It might not be bad...
snow-covered slopes,
the skiing,
christianas and stemming
and blatzing
and schussing.
Hot-buttered rum...
light on the butter.
And snow.

a spade of snow #

# Where it's snowing

Pine Tree.
Coming into Pine Tree.
- Hi.
- Good morning, Little Mary Sunshine.
- How did you sleep?
- Like a baby.
Remember Nanook of the North?
You got the shelf?
Must've lost the toss.
I'll help you down.
Let's visit the fireman.
- Your strategy's obvious.
- You don't mind, do you?
I got a flash for you.
She's a real slow mover.
I got a flash right back.
She's in there with the champ.
Our work's
cut out for us.
I've got a plan.
Come on. Let's go.
- Hey!
- What?
Bob, Betty, Judy, come here!
I think we took the wrong train.
It's green out here.
How about that?
We're still in Carolina.
They must have grass-covered
igloos here.
Here, honey.
Take this.
This is warmer
than Florida.
Where's the beach?
We should've brought
bathing suits.
Is this Vermont,
New England's winter playground?
This must be
southern Vermont.
I don't understand.
Where's the snow?
This is supposed to be
America's snow playground.
We haven't had snow since
Thanksgiving. 68 yesterday.
- Car for Columbia Inn.
- That's us.
Vermont must be wonderful...
all that underwear.
Hope I can take
the electric blanket back.
- Where's that?
- Under the underwear.
You'll get a nice tan...
- # Snow #
- # Snow #
# It won't be long #
# Before we'll all
be there with #
# Little ol' snowflakes
Eskimo pie #
# Chocolate and vanilla
for you and I #
# Boom de de boom
de de boom ##
Aren't you glad you came?
You can schuss
as much as you want.
<i>If ve can find da snow.</i>
Welcome to Columbia Inn.
What accommodations
would you like?
I can offer a wide choice,
including my room.
We're not guests.
We're the Haynes sisters.
We came up for the snow.
Where are you keeping it?
We take it in
during the day.
We can't use you.
We'll pay you half salary
for canceling.
Are things that bad?
We're hanging wash
on the ski tow.
You aren't going to
stay either.
If the girls are leaving,
I'll get the luggage.
General Waverly!
Sir.
At ease.
How are you, Captain?
I'm fine, General, but...
We keep the general
part quiet.
Why? Begging
uour pardon, sir.
Putting it
in one sentence,
people don't expect a major general
to carry firewood.
Bob, I was just thinking... Hi.
Private Davis, sir.
At ease, Davis.
General Waverly...
a janitor.
Never thought I'd make it?
Oh, yes, sir, sir.
You could do anything you
put your mind to, sir...
but... a janitor!
Actually, it's worse.
I own this hotel.
- A landlord!
- He got in a shrewd business move.
If I start introductions,
can I get to meet
these young ladies?
- Why, sure.
- My housekeeper, Miss Emma Allen.
- My granddaughter Susan Waverly.
- Hello.
- We're the Haynes sisters.
- Your floor show.
Don't worry.
I told 'em we're canceling.
Why? We have a floor, right?
Yeah, but who will
they sing to?
It's worth it
for just us.
There'll be snow tonight.
We'll be full tomorrow.
That's the forecast?
No, but the army
taught me to be positive
when you don't know what
uou're talking about.
You needn't feel obligated.
Since there's no snow...
Nonsense!
There's a contract.
Your first performance
is tonight at 8:00.
Be there, or I'll sue.
Here.
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.
I'm on KP.
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!
# Those who've #
# Seen us #
# Know that not a thing
could come between us #
# Many men have tried
to split us up #
# But no one can #
# Lord help the mister #
# Who comes between
me and my sister #
# And Lord help
the sister #
# Who comes between
me and my man #
We ate, and then he ate.
We slept,
and then he slept.
Then he woke up,
nobody slept for 48 hours.
# Sisters #
# Sisters ##
Hi, girls.
<i>We'll give you pointers
on that sister number.</i>
- I hate the wardrobe.
- It's so "purty. "
Isn't this awful?
Taking money under
false pretenses.
Wouldn't he let us work
for half-salary?
Light Horse Harry
never retreats.
- He's advancing into bankruptcy.
- How deep's he in here?
He's sunk everything
into remodeling this place.
It was a barn,
now it's a Tyrolean
haunted house.
Well, eat hearty.
Isn't there something
we can do?
There is. We're going
to New York in the morning.
- But you just got here.
- We've got connections.
We'll dig him up a spot.
The problem is here, now.
We've got to get people
into this place.
- What do you suggest?
- I don't know.
Some kind of novelty that...
What's a novelty up in Vermont,
brainstorm?
- We'll dig up a Democrat.
- They'd stone him.
If you ask me,
what this place needs
is a dynamite act.
Now you're talking!
Something really
big, like, uh...
Wallace and Davis.
They're too big.
Wait a minute.
How about that?
Fit the girls
into our old act.
- What do you say?
- I think that's a great idea.
Half a great idea, anyhow.
Excuse me.
Get me the New York operator.
Okay, Mr. Wallace.
This way.
He's got that "Rodgers
and Hammerstein look. "
Is that bad?
Not bad,
but always expensive.
Excuse me.
I know it sounds crazy, but
uou're working for crazy people.
Al, I want the show
here in three days.
Sets, costumes, and all
the cast you can round up.
What will this cost?
Everybody gets an extra week's pay
and you get a bonus.
- What's the cost?
- We open Christmas eve.
The tab... how much?
Al, what's this going
to set us back?
- Wow.
- How much is "wow"?
Al, do the best you can.
Good luck.
- How much?
- We've got a big job.
- We fill in acts with the sisters.
- How much is "wow"?
Right in between
"ouch" and "poing!"
Wow.
I'm right behind you.
I won't tell the general.
I think bringing your show here
is the nicest...
How did you know?
Like any decent,
self-respecting housekeeper,
I listened in on the other phone,
and I just don't know what to say.
- He thought of it.
- It was a lovely thought.
- Wow!
- Get a hold of yourself.
Check in the lobby
for your room numbers!
Kids, find your rooms.
Get your rehearsal costumes on.
We start rehearsals
after breakfast.
You brought your
whole show up here?
Most of it, sir.
It's still not clear. Why?
We have to close down
for the holidays,
business is bad...
I know about business
being bad.
We figured we would do
our rehearsing here.
- Why here?
- You got this empty ski lodge...
we figured it was ideal,
didn't we?
That's the word
we used... "ideal. "
We saw this lodge
and we said "ideal. "
- Absolutely ideal.
- Ideal.
We've established the fact
the lodge is ideal.
We can test new material.
We use the audience
like guinea pigs.
Pigs we can get.
I'm not sure about people.
Wallace and Davis never
had trouble packing them in.
- People, not pigs.
- Well, go ahead if you want to.
I just don't understand
show business.
- It'll come to you.
- It takes time.
We wouldn't
be good as generals.
You weren't
good as privates.
Take it from the top.
And!
That's right.
All right,
keep it lively.
Let's keep it going.
Keep it up, honey.
Move that
lumber over, fellas.
Take it over
on the other side.
# I'd rather see
a minstrel show #
# Than any other
show I know #
# Ah, those comical folks #
# With their
riddles and jokes #
# Now here is the riddle
that I love the best #
# Why does a chicken go... #
# You know the rest #
# Yes, sir, I'd pawn
my overcoat and vest #
# To see a minstrel show #
# Mr. Bones
Mr. Bones #
# How do you feel
Mr. Bones #
# Rattlin' #
# Mr. Bones feels rattlin' #
# Ha! Ha!
That's a good one #
# Tell a little story
Mr. Bones #
# A funny little story
Mr. Bones #
# How can you stop an angry dog
from biting you on Monday #
# That joke is old, the answer is
to kill the dog on Sunday #
# That's not the way
to stop a dog #
# From biting you
on Monday #
# How would you bring
the thing about #
# Have the doggie's
teeth pulled out #
# Oh, Mr. Bones
that's terrible #
# Yes, Mr. Bones
that's terrible #
# Mr. Interloc'ter #
# What is wrong with you #
# Well, I know
of a doctor #
# Tell about him, do #
# Sad to say
one day he fell #
# Right into
a great big well #
# Oh, that's too bad #
# But, but not at all #
# Why speak in such a tone #
# He should have
attended to the sick #
# And let the well alone #
# That's a joke #
# That was told #
# In the minstrel days
we miss #
# When Georgie Primrose
used to sing #
# And dance to
a song like this #
# Mandy #
# Mandy #
# Mandy #
# Mandy #
# There's a minister handy #
# And it sure
would be dandy #
# If we let him
make a fee #
# So don't you linger #

for your finger #

# Come along and let
the wedding chimes #

# And me #
# Ohh ##
Wonderful.
This will bring
business in, Grandpa.
Was everything all right?
All right?
It was great.
Was the tempo a little slow
for you right here?
# Mandy #
# There's a minister handy #
Drive in there.
Keep it going.
# So listen, Mandy #
# There's a minister hand... ##
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, I can see that's... better.
That's much better.
Much, much better.
# Mandy, there's
a minister handy ##
# Mandy, there's
a minister handy ##
- Anything wrong?
- No. I'm just restless.
Anything on your mind?
Uh-uh.
Just restless.
- Want something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.
Emma left
some sandwiches out.
Go to sleep.
And some buttermilk.
Good night, Judy.
Good night.
If you eat something
before going to bed...
Judy.
No, no, it drains the blood
from the head.
In case you're
thinking of anything
or anybody or just anything.
All right.
Fine. Okay. Swell.
I'll go get something.
If I don't get something to eat,
uou won't go to sleep.
Good night.
Hi.
Well, hello.
What's doing?
- I couldn't sleep.
- You're young for that route.
Aren't there sandwiches
and buttermilk?
This is the place.
We is loaded here.
We got the New England blue plate.
We got the Vermont smorgasbord.
Not as classy as Toots Schor's,
but the price is right.
- What'll you have?
- Anything.
What do you want to dream about?
I'll know what to give you.
My theory is different foods
make different dreams.
If I have ham on rye,
I dream about
a tall blonde.
Turkey, I dream
about a brunette
on the scatback side,
but sexy, sexy.
What about liverwurst?
I dream about liverwurst.
It's a little
chilly in here.
I got just the spot.
Grab the cow.
We'll gather
around the fire.
Got an open hearth with some
Vermont logs burning briskly.
- Isn't this nice?
- Wonderful.
- Glad you came?
- It's better than a picnic.
Certainly. No yellow jackets
buzzing around.
I usually don't have
any trouble sleeping.
You've come to the right fella.
Here. Sit down.
I have a theory
about that, too.
- Would you like to hear it?
- Very much.
# When I'm worried
and I can't sleep #
# I count my blessings #
# Instead of sheep #
# I fall asleep #
# Counting my blessings #
# When my bankroll #
# Is gettin' small #
# I think of when #
# I had none at all #
# And I fall asleep #
# Counting my blessings #
# I think about a nursery #
# And I picture curly heads #
# And one by one
I count them #
# As they slumber
in their beds #
# If you're worried #
# And you can't sleep #
#Just count
uour blessings #
# Instead of sheep #
# And you'll fall asleep #
# Counting your blessings #
- Do you mind if I say something?
- Of course not.
What you're doing
for the general
is one of the most decent
and unselfish things I've heard of.
- No angle?
- No angle.
I apologize about Florida.
I've always been
a silly schoolgirl...
The lady fair and the knight
on the white horse.
It's dangerous,
putting knights on white horses.
Likely to slip off.
I think mine's
here to stay.
That's good to know.
A fella feels shaky up there
on a bleached charger.
- Are you worried?
- Kind of.
# If you're worried #
# And you can't sleep #
#Just count
uour blessings #
# Instead of sheep #
# And you'll fall asleep #
# Counting your blessings ##
Ahem! Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I was after something
for a sweet tooth.
You beat me to it.
Try the Vermont smorgasbord.
You'll sleep like a baby.
Thank you.
You know something?
You still haven't
eaten anything.
I know exactly what
I'll dream about.
Good for you.
Hold your fire.
I'm coming through.
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning, General.
Looks like you're
on active duty.
Emma drafted me
for some chores.
I picked up the handbills
for the show.
- Oh?
- Look pretty good, huh?
That should bring in
quite a few guinea pigs.
You ever play horseshoes?
I'm too young for that.
One shouldn't play horseshoes
till the parade's
passed him by.
That'll be some time.
Thank you.
I still don't know too much
about show business.
And guinea pigs,
but if you and Phil
are worried
about the welfare of
a certain Vermont innkeeper,
uou needn't be.
His innkeeping days
are numbered.
I wouldn't say that.
You know, I been
watching those clouds.
There's snow in them.
Those are cumulus clouds,
elevation 7,000 feet.
It could snow overnight.
Let me tell you something.
I'm going back
in the army.
Really?
- I've applied for active duty.
- That's wonderful news.
They'd better not
give me a desk job.
I'm holding out for
a training command.
When will you hear?
I expect a letter from Washington
any day now.
Holy smoke!
I'm on the ball.
I've got the mail.
There's a letter for you.
Here it is.
It's from Washington.
- Looks like the one.
- "War Department. " See?
My glasses are in my room.
I'd like to
read this alone,
but I'm too anxious.
Read it, son.
Slowly.
I'm starting to play trombone
a little, too.
I have to focus in.
"Dear Tom,
uou dirty old... "
Skip that word.
"I was surprised
hearing from you.
"Your amusing letter
was appreciated.
"You've got time
to be amusing,
"sitting on that porch,
rocking, while we work.
"I envy you.
"Soon, I was saying to Edie,
'I can take it easy
like old Tom. "'
Old Tom.
"Some people
have all the luck.
Everything is fine here. "
The rest of it
is about the family.
He's telling me they can't use me,
no place for me.
We're not fooling each other.
It wouldn't be too hard
to learn horseshoes,
would it?
It's a cinch.
There's a lot
to be said for leisure.
You've been active, but...
Never kid a kidder, son.
See you later.
That's a good one.
Fine, kids.
Take a rest.
Phil, we're ready to run
through the choreography number.
In just a minute.
You're going to
get a division up here?
Just enough guys
from his unit
to let him know
he's not forgotten.
Won't the show help?
If you'd seen him with that
letter, you'd know it wouldn't.
It'll take five days
to put the show on.
How will we contact
all the fellas?
Television. Ed Harrison.
I'll get on his show
and pitch
to the guys myself.
- What do you think?
- It's impossible
ridiculous, and insane.
- Anything else?
- I wish I'd thought of it first.
You rehearse.
I'll go call.
Get the kids
for a dress rehearsal.
Emma, would you call Ed Harrison
in New York City?
The Television
Ed Harrison?
That's the fella.
You'll catch him
at Radio City.
- Keep it quiet. It's personal.
- Sure. Ed Harrison.
Television.
New York City.
All right, fellas.
From the top.
The theater,
the theater.
What's happened
to the theater,
especially where
dancing is concerned?
# Chaps #
# Who did taps #
# Aren't tapping anymore #
# They're doin' choreography #
# Chicks #
# Who did kicks #
# Aren't kicking anymore #
# They're doin' choreography #
# Heps #
# Who did steps #
# That would stop the show
in days that used to be #
# Through the air
they keep flying #
# Like a duck
that is dying #
# Instead of dance
it's choreography ##
Ed, it's a long shot,
but it's the only way
to reach the men in a hurry.
How does it sound?
I love the idea.
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't know how
to peel potatoes.
Why not go all out,
put the show on TV?
I'll come up myself.
Bring the works.
That's not the idea.
It's a great idea.
Televise the show right
from Pine Tree,
a real Christmas eve show
about how you're playing Santa
to the old man.
Plenty of schmaltz.
It's worth free advertising
for you and Phil.
We'll put him on.
It'll tear their hearts out.
Here's the laundry, Emma.
We're not commercializing
on the old man's hard luck.
I'll just appear on your show
and make a little pitch. Okay?
Wonderful, wonderful.
See you Sunday night. Bye.
Take it upstairs, Susan.
All right.
Emma!
Was there a telegram for me?
Oh. Yeah.
It's an offer from the
Carousel Club in New York.
- You hold them up to light?
- That's for amateurs. I use steam.
You're quite a pro.
Stick your nose
in other people's business,
uou discover things
uou shouldn't.
Anything specific?
The boys are planning
to televise this show
right from here
on Christmas eve.
Bob fixed it with Ed Harrison.
"Real schmaltz. "
They're even putting
the general on.
I can't believe it.
That'll make him look pathetic
from coast to coast.
What's it gonna do
for his pride?
But it means free publicity
for Davis and Wallace.
That's a terrible
thing to say.
Bob said it.
I heard him.
Bob wouldn't do
anything like that.
If I'm wrong,
I'll resign as president...
of the New England chapter
of Busybodies Anonymous.
Oh, my nerves!
Have you seen Bob?
Did he call New York, Emma?
- I understand he did.
- Oh, good.
I hear television's
entered the picture.
- He worked it out?
- Beautifully.
- It's a great angle.
- Brilliant.
Keep this quiet.
The general shouldn't
know because...
- I understand.
- Betty, Bob's waiting to rehearse.
Anything wrong?
Tell him I'm coming.
- How about lunch?
- I'm not hungry.
- But...
- I said I'm not hungry.
What's with her?
I'm not sure, but I have an idea.
I wanna think about it.
Let's think about it
over a sandwich.
I'm starving to death.
Maybe rehearsal's
gotten her crazy.
<i>Howdy. I was playing
this Blessings number.</i>
Might be something we do together.
Wanna try it from the release?
# When my bankroll
is gettin' small #
# I think of when
I had none at all #
# And I fall asleep #
# Counting my blessings ##
What's the matter?
Bad key for you?
- I'm not right for this song.
- Yes, you are. Let's try it.
- I'm not right.
- Don't be silly.
What I'm trying to say
I don't feel like doing it.
I'm not sure
I'll do the show.
Well, what is this?
You sleep well last night?
I'd rather not
discuss last night.
Oh, come now.
I admit I was carried away,
but don't get upset
over a simple kiss.
There's nothing for you
to feel guilty about.
- Look who's talking about guilt.
- What do you mean by that?
You shouldn't mix fairy tales
with liverwurst.
- What did you have for lunch?
- I didn't have lunch.
Then eat something.
Why is everybody concerned
about my eating habits?
- Leave me alone.
- Whoa, whoa. Time. Cut.
Say what you're thinking,
or get to work.
I've got details
to take care of.
Then let's skip this.
I won't interfere with
uour great business plans.
- That's quite a remark.
- Sorry. It's the best I can do.
I got no time for games today.
Are you singing this song or not?
- I don't want to.
- Nobody's twisting your arm.
- Is that all, Mr. Wallace?
- That's all, Miss Haynes!
How do you figure that?
Daylight's beginning
to glimmer.
Last night
she couldn't sleep.
Today she won't eat.
She's in love.
If that's love,
somebody goofed.
It's love, but
she's fighting it.
- Why?
- Because of me.
She's always been
my mother hen.
She won't leave the roost
until I'm settled.
That's funny.
Are you sure?
She'll never look for someone
until I'm married or engaged.
That's the end of that.
Unless I get myself
engaged real fast.
Even if it made any sense,
uou're here in the wilderness.
- There's nobody around here.
- I don't know.
Oh, be realistic.
Who could you find up here?
I suppose it should
be someone I know.
- That always helps.
- It's gotta be a man.
An absolute must.
A mature man with talent
and experience...
Witty, gay, charming,
attractive.
Where will you
find such a superman?
- Don't be so modest.
- Honey, fellas like that don't...
Me?
You're not superman,
but you're available.
Don't get any ideas.
I'm not the marrying kind.
- It's just an engagement.
- I'm not the engaging kind either.
What kind are you?
The "I'll push
my friend into it,
but I'm scared stiff
myself" kind.
How terrible could it be for a few
days? You do like me, don't you?
Uh... sure, I do.
I'm not exactly repulsive.
Of course...
Of course not.
You find me gay, amusing,
fun to be with?
Sure, but I feel the same way
about my cocker spaniel.
Well, let's just skip it.
I was only thinking
of Betty and Bob.
Betty and Bob. Yeah.
Look, it would
only be temporary?
Well, of course.
You don't think I'm the kind
who throws herself
at a man, do you?
Of course not.
Nobody thinks that.
Let me figure this out.
It would last two or three weeks
at the worst... at the most, I mean.
Well, of course.
And we wouldn't
announce our engagement
until it was
absolutely necessary?
Absolutely necessary.
Well... okay.
It's a deal.
But...
don't you think we ought
to kiss or something?
Uh... not until it's
absolutely necessary.
Isn't it
a wonderful party?
Bob, would you
like to dance?
I'm game if you are.
Betty, how about
some exercise?
Come on.
# The best things #
# Happen while
uou're dancing #
# Things that you
would not do at home #
# Come naturally
on the floor #
# For dancing #
# Soon becomes romancing #
Hi.
# When you hold
a girl in your arms #
# That you never held before #
# Even guys
with two left feet #
# Come out all right
if the girl is sweet #
# If by chance their
cheeks should meet #
# While dancing... ##
Mr. Herring, Miss Lettuce.
- How are you?
- Mutual, I'm sure.
- Bye.
- May I?
Looks like it's
absolutely necessary.
What?
You mean, uh...
Hold it, fellas.
Give me a little
ching-a-ring.
Folks, I have
an announcement.
You'll be the first to know.
Do the best things happen
while you're dancing,
or do they just
happen in Vermont?
But, uh, Judy
has just agreed
to, uh...
I mean, uh...
She just
asked me, uh...
that is,
she just said...
I'm trying to say
we're engaged.
- Yay!
- Yay!
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.
I wish it would
happen to me.
Yeah. I do, too.
It's just wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.
I hoped you would be.
Is everything all right?
Sure. I'm fine.
You're getting the best girl
in the world.
Oh, uh... yeah.
- Take care of her.
- Sure.
This calls for champagne.
I'll help, Emma.
Congratulations, kids.
I don't know
what you see in him,
but he's almost endurable.
You're settling down...
pipe, slippers, the works.
All the best, boy.
The water's fine.
Why don't you take a little plunge?
Seemed a little icy today.
By tomorrow,
it'll warm up.
You sold me.
I'll go.
Well, aren't you going
to kiss the bride?
Kiss the...
Oh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir!
That didn't hurt too much.
In some ways, you're far
superior to my cocker spaniel.
- At ease, General.
- Oh!
Champagne?
Yeah, I think I will.
Champagne?
Here. Let's drink
to their happiness.
To buttermilk
and liverwurst
and getting things back
to where they were yesterday.
We said we'd
never break up the act,
but that wasn't realistic.
We both knew
that someday one of us
would want to be free.
Now that I'm taken care of,
I'm not your
responsibility anymore.
If there's anything special
uou want to do,
uou can feel free
to go and do it.
Isn't that true?
I say, isn't that true?
Betty, honey,
are you asleep?
Hmm.
Good night.
Thanks, General.
When you get back,
give this to Judy.
It explains everything.
This might be
a tactical error.
I watched you
and Bob last night.
You two need a talking-to.
It's a private war.
Don't do anything.
I promise.
Good luck.
On Christmas eve
we'll have special
trains coming in
from Boston, Philadelphia,
New York.
- Can you handle it?
- I'll call the traffic manager.
Good. But remember,
strictly off the record.
- Yes.
- Board!
Oh, Betty!
Where are you going?
- I've got a job in New York.
- Where?
Good-bye. Good luck. I hope you
have great success with the show.
If I said anything,
I didn't mean it.
I must have sounded
like an idiot.
- Good-bye.
- I didn't mean...
Kids, take five.
<i>Judy, John, let's run through
the Abraham number.</i>
Watch your tempo
on the last part.
Keep it rocking, fellas.
All right, kids,
come up here.
It's for you.
Betty gave it to Grandpa
at the station.
Station?
Phil.
Phil!
- What's the matter?
- Phil, it's from Betty.
How could you be
stupid enough to try this?
Phony engagements!
You should be horsewhipped!
First you, then you,
and then you again.
I did it for you.
Because I'm lonely
and unhappy.
When you're unhappy,
I'm unhappy.
After all, I...
Don't start that
lifesaving bit again.
I don't expect gratitude.
Sometimes I wish
the wall had fallen on me.
Don't say that.
And you, her own sister,
how could you do such a thing?
She's been a mother hen...
We wanted the
mother hen to leave
so the chick...
I guess we laid an egg.
You laid a Vermont
volleyball.
I'm going to New York
to try and square it with Betty.
Consider yourself plenty lucky.
You might have been stuck
with this weirdsmobile
for life!
- Oh, Judy!
- Leave the kid alone.
You've confused her
enough already.
- You don't understand...
- You've mixed things up.
You listen to me.
I got a job for you,
if you can get
one simple thing straight.
Well, try me.
<i>The general always listens
to The Ed Harrison Show.</i>
I'm on about 9:00.
Tell Emma. Maybe she can help ypu.
Don't let him
near that television.
I won't, even if
it breaks my arm!
Break your arm,
but don't break
anything valuable.
You can depend on me.
Let's see...
break the arm...
Mr. Wallace, I have
a table ready for you.
Has Betty Haynes
been on yet?
Not yet.
I'm expecting Eddie Harrison.
Show him to the table.
Thanks.
Let's not do
the number we rehearsed.
<i>Play Blue Skies, anything.</i>
- The rehearsal sounded great.
- I know, but...
It's wonderful.
Let's do it, please.
# Love #
# You didn't do right by me #
# You planned a romance #
# That just hadn't a chance #
# And I'm through #
# Love #
# You didn't do right by me #
# I'm back on the shelf #
# And I'm blaming myself #
# But it's you #
# My one love affair #
# Didn't get anywhere #
# From the start #
# To send me a Joe #
# Who had winter and snow #
# In his heart #
# Wasn't smart #
# Love #
# You didn't do right by me #
# As they say in the song #
# You done me wrong #
# My one love affair #
# Didn't get anywhere #
# From the start #
# To send me a Joe #
# Who had winter and snow #
# In his heart #
# Wasn't smart #
# Oh, love #
# You didn't do right by me #
# As they say in the song #
# You done me wrong #
# Yes, Mr. Love #
# You done me wrong ##
Surprise.
What brings you here?
- I had business to take care of.
- Oh, I see.
- Some of it concerns you.
- Really?
You didn't have to break up
the act or leave town
because Judy and Phil's
engagement was phony.
They were trying to
get rid of any barriers
between you
and the altar.
They thought we were serious
about each other.
That shows how
foolish people can be.
Why do people interfere
in other people's business?
- That's Phil for you.
- That's Judy for you.
We were just having
a few laughs,
and suddenly we're in love
with each other.
- Ridiculous.
- Sure.
They're sorry about it now.
Judy wants you to come back.
I'd like to see you
come back, myself.
Well, I don't know...
I know your knight
has slipped off his charger.
Why? I don't know.
But I'd like to do what I can
to get him up there again.
Mr. Wallace has been
expecting you, sir.
Bob, come on,
it's 8:30.
Oh, this is Ed Harrison.
Hi. Finally got it squared away,
just the way you wanted it.
- That's swell, Ed.
- We're late.
Just a second.
I got to scoot.
- Could I see you later?
- Sorry. I have a date.
- Tomorrow?
- No, I'll be busy all day.
- You better go.
- What'll I tell Judy?
I'll think about it.
Good-bye.
Think Phil can keep
the general away
from the television?
When it comes to finagling,
uou can't beat this boy.
Hello, girls.
You have the right station?
Oh, sure.
Grandpa, the battery's dead
on the Jeep.
I'll fix it later.
<i>I don't want to miss
The Ed Harrison Show.</i>
Judy.
Should be a good
show tonight.
Ahh! General, come quickly!
What's this?
A terrible thing!
Fell down the stairs.
- Go help him.
- Oh!
What is it?
Did you fall downstairs?
Yes, sir.
I'm all right.
Probably just a small
compound fracture.
There we are.
How's it feel?
Feels pretty good, sir.
Put your weight on it.
Right here, sir.
Ooh!
Susan, call a doctor.
Oh, please don't do that.
It's probably just a small
internal muscular hemorrhage.
It'll be all right.
We'll take you
where it's comfortable.
Let's go watch
the television.
Oh... oh!
Well, I'm going
to call the doctor.
Please, sir.
Don't bother.
Just help me back
to the bungalow.
Oh... oh!
Thank you, sir.
I wouldn't want to faint
in front of the women.
Oh, oh!
Oh! I'll be all right. Oh!
Don't put your
weight on it.
No, sir... oh!
Fine, sir.
Thank you, thank you.
It's a privilege to present
my special guest,
an old army pal, a great guy
and a great entertainer,
Bob Wallace.
Bob's got a special message
for all you guys
in the 151 st Division.
It's about someone
close to us all.
- Bob.
- Thanks, Eddie.
# When the war was over #
# Why, there were
jobs galore #
# For the G.I. Josephs #
# Who were in the war #
# But for generals #
# Things were not so grand #
# And it's not so hard
to understand #
# What can you do
with a general #
# When he stops
being a general #
# Oh, what can you do
with a general #
# Who retires #
# Who's got a job
for a general #
# When he stops
being a general #
# They all get a job #
# But a general
no one hires #
# They fill his chest
with medals #
# While he's across the foam #
# And they spread
the crimson carpet #
# When he comes
marchin' home #
# The next day
someone hollers #
# When he comes into view #
# "Here comes the general" #
# And they all say,
"General who" #
# They're delighted that he came #
# But they can't
recall his name #
# Nobody thinks
of assigning him #
# When they've stopped
wining and dining him #
# It seems this country
never has enjoyed #
# So many one and two #
# And three and
four-star generals #
# Unemployed ##
That song is for
the 151 st Division...
the officers and men
under the command
of Major General Tom Waverly.
I have something
I want you to do.
Don't you want
to sit down?
No, sir. Just walk
me around the barn.
That's a little
too fast, sir.
If we just slowed down.
I know it's murder
leaving your homes
on Christmas eve.
It's easier for
fellas in New England,
But remember this.
Nobody connected with the show
is getting anything out of it,
except a chance to give
a Christmas gift
to the nicest guy
we'll ever know.
Your objective
is Pine Tree, Vermont.
Synchronize your watches
for Operation Waverly.
How are you?
Good to see you.
When I give the signal,
fall in single file
on the stage.
Fall in at attention like
uou did in Montecatino.
Big day for you.
You got stuff
hung on you.
Face the general,
and then march out
like you used to.
Okay, boys.
Captain, these things
have shrunked.
Your appetite hasn't shrunk.
Who's there?
Boom!
They're sure gone.
You sent all my suits
to the cleaners?
- You've only got two.
- You should send one at a time.
- Wear your uniform.
- I won't appear in uniform.
- Please, Gramps.
- Absolutely not.
I'll explain to Bob and Phil
that you didn't care
to come tonight.
I'll have you
court-martialed.
You're not obliged to go.
I'll make my own decisions.
I got along in the army
without you.
It took 15,000 men
to replace me.
15,000 men...
It'll be awful
if he doesn't come down.
It's Betty!
Welcome home, Betty.
Hello, Emma.
Hi, Suzy.
Where's Judy?
Honey, I'm so glad you came.
- Did you say anything to Bob?
- Mm-mm.
Hurry. You haven't much time.
If I wasn't so mean,
I'd cry.
Grandpa.
You look wonderful.
Did you expect me
to wear my bathrobe?
No.
Ten-hut!
# We'll follow the old man #
# Wherever he wants to go #
# As long as he wants to go #
# Opposite to the foe #
# We'll stay
with the old man #
# Wherever he wants to stay #
# Long as he stays away
from the battle's fray #
# Because we love him #
# We love him #
# Especially when he
keeps us on the ball #
# And we'll tell
the kiddies #
# We answered duty's call #
# With the grandest
son-of-a-soldier of them all #
# Because we love him #
# We love him #
# Especially when he
keeps us on the ball #
# And we'll tell
the kiddies #
# We answered duty's call #
# With the grandest
son-of-a-soldier of them all ##
Troops are ready
for inspection, sir.
Just routine, sir.
I am not satisfied with
this division's conduct.
Having been at Anzio
doesn't entitle you
not to wear neckties.
Neckties will be worn here.
Look at you.
You're a disgrace
to the outfit!
You're soft,
uou're sloppy,
uou're unruly,
uou're undisciplined...
and I never saw anything look
so wonderful in my whole life.
Thank you all.
- Thanks, Phil.
- General.
I'm grateful, Captain.
Ten-hut!
- # When I was mustered out #
- Look out!
# I thought without a doubt #
# That I was through
with all my care and strife #
# Well, I thought
that I was then #
# The happiest of men #
# But after months of tough
civilian life #
# Whoop-te-doo #
# Gee, I wish I was
back in the army #
# The army wasn't
really bad at all #
# Three meals a day #
# Three for which
uou didn't pay #
# Uniforms for winter
spring, and fall #
# There's a lot
to be said for the army #
# The life without
responsibility #
# A soldier out of luck #
# Was really never stuck #
# There's always
someone higher up #
# Where you can
pass the buck #
# Oh, gee, I wish
I was back in the army #
# Gee, I wish I was
back in the army #
# The army was the place
to find romance #
# Soldiers and WACS #
# The WACS who
dressed in slacks #
# Dancing cheek to cheek
and pants to pants #
# There's a lot
to be said for the army #
# A gal was never
lost for company #
# A million handsome guys #
# With longing in their eyes #
# And all you had to do #
# Was pick the age
the weight, the size #
# Oh, gee, I wish
I was back in the army #
# Gee, I wish
I was back in the army #
# The shows we got
civilians couldn't see #
# How we would yell #
Hey-hey!
# For Dietrich and Cornell #
#Jolson, Hope
and Benny all for free #
# There's a lot
to be said for the army #
# The best of doctors
watched you carefully #
# A dentist and a clerk #
# For weeks and weeks
they'd work #
# They'd make a thousand
dollar job #
# And give it to a jerk #
# Oh, gee, I wish
I was back in the army #
# Three meals a day #
# For which you didn't pay #
# A million handsome guys #
# With longing in their eyes #
# I thought that I was through #
# With all my care and strife #
# But after months
and months #
# Of tough civilian life #
# Oh, gee #
# I wish I was
back in the army now ##
Oh, ho!
Buster, lookie here!
- Here it comes!
- This is it.
Isn't this great?
Come on, Phil.
Open that side.
- Lookie here.
- Isn't this great?
We may get snowed in here.
- # Snow #
- # Snow #
Merry Christmas!
Remember, hold those
candles up high.
Keep a straight line.
How's your voice, Bobby?
- I'm Bobby.
- Oh, pardon me.
How's your voice?
Let me hear.
# Do ##
Oh, those were the days.
We're going on now.
Watch your spacing.
Don't get too far apart.
That's it.
Keep the candles up.
Okay, Byron.
# I'm dreaming of
a white Christmas #
#Just like the ones
I used to know #
# Where the treetops glisten #
# And children listen #
# To hear sleigh bells
in the snow #
# I'm dreaming of
a white Christmas #
# With every
Christmas card I write #
# May your days be merry #
# And bright #

Who's there?
Santa Claus.
Welcome to the family.
Relatives already?
Wallace and Davis are flat.
We gotta take the show to Chicago.
I can't.
I'll be busy.
Wait a minute.
I'll join you.
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!
