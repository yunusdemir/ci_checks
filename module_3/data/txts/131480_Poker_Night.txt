<i>In truth,</i>
<i>they're bastard stepchildren--</i>
<i>wisdom and hindsight.</i>
<i>You only get it</i>
<i>after you need it.</i>
<i>It doesn't help you right now.</i>
<i>It only teaches you enough</i>
<i>to help you the next time.</i>
<i>I'm talking about</i>
<i>the kind of wisdom</i>
<i>that comes from experience.</i>
<i>The kind that tells you</i>
<i>if your wife pushes you</i>
<i>to take the night shift,</i>
<i>there's probably a reason.</i>
<i>And then there's hindsight.</i>
<i>It's like looking</i>
<i>in the rearview mirror.</i>
<i>You can't see</i>
<i>what you're going through</i>
<i>until you've driven past it.</i>
<i>Hindsight, like,</i>
<i>"Ah, what do you mean</i>
<i> I've had too much to drink?</i>
<i>I'll be fine."</i>
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>
<i>They don't help you</i>
<i>with today,</i>
<i>only with tomorrow.</i>
<i>But tomorrow is a day away.</i>
<i>And today, well--</i>
<i>Today's a shitstorm</i>
<i>I might not live through.</i>
<i>So let me take you back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>
<i>'Cause the only way</i>
<i>to get any wisdom</i>
<i>out of my story...</i>
<i>is to look at it in hindsight.</i>
    Well,
    you're legit now, hero.
If you make it
through poker night,
it's all downhill from there.
And, uh,
considering you're a...
wet-nose, son of a bitch
political appointee--
you did okay.
        The boys seem to think
        you got potential.
Glad to hear you approve,
Lieutenant.
- I never said
      I approve, shithead.
            And don't fuck up,
            all right?
            And don't ever
            make us look bad.
        And get rid of that
        piece of shit eyesore.
    You're gonna be a detective,
    you gotta start
    driving like one.
First thing tomorrow.
Hey, thanks, Lieutenant.
                    Fuck you.

<i>But it wasn't as if</i>

        Hey!
<i>That was it.</i>
<i>The first sign.</i>
<i>I could've seen it coming</i>

<i>Doesn't matter</i>

                Hello?
<i>I never get it right.</i>
                    Fucker.
            Go! Run!
No.
            Not again.
            Please.
            You said--
<i>Taking the call.</i>
<i>I wasn't doing anyone</i>

<i>Had a few two many</i>

<i>Wasn't really in any shape</i>

<i>It's an empty street</i>

<i>Amy.</i>
<i>Well, she was a mistake</i>

        Shit! Amy?
            Where am I?
            Who are you?
<i>It is now day three, and still</i>
<i>no word on the whereabouts</i>
<i>of Detective Stan Jeter,</i>
    <i> missing since Sunday.</i>
        <i> His car was found here</i>
        <i> by the lake,</i>
        <i> but there are no signs</i>
        <i> of any struggle.</i>
    <i> For the past two days,</i>
    <i> search crews have dredged</i>
    <i> the waterway.</i>
<i>Lieutenant</i>
<i>Calabrese, tell us what you've</i>
<i>heard about Detective Jeter.</i>
    <i> We're not gonna give up</i>
    <i> till we find him.</i>
<i>Anybody seen or heard anything,</i>
<i>please contact the station.</i>
<i>Channel 9 viewers</i>
<i>might remember Stan Jeter...</i>
<i>as the heroic officer</i>
<i>who single-handedly brought down</i>
<i>Terence Alby.</i>
            Let me out of here,
            you son of a bitch.
        Oh! Hey, listen to me.
        Listen to me.
        Listen to me.
You know I'm a cop, right? You--
You hurt a cop and they're
coming after you, man.
And-And no-no mercy.
Well, you let me out
right now, we can
sort this out and--
        Everything happens
        for a reason, Detective.
                Remember that.
                Also remember...
        people see what
        they want you to see.
        They're looking for you
        at the river.
                    Not here.
                    In a week,
                no one will
                be looking
                for you at all.
            No one will
            remember you at all.
                        In fact,
                you're already
                being forgotten.
What the fuck is that?
<i>Three days.</i>
<i>God, help me.</i>
<i>Three days in this room.</i>
<i>Three days lost.</i>
Come on.
<i>Three days since poker night.</i>
Ah.
        Look who's here.
        Guest of honor.
How often do we get a fuckin'
genuine hero in our midst, boys?
        Yeah. All right.
What'd you bring?
Come on. Come on. Listen.
Just get your stuff and listen.
I'm telling--
I'm in the middle of a story.
                        Sorry.
        All right, so--
        Where was I?
            You lost me at
            "Once upon a time."
    I got it. I got it. Okay.
Okay. So I spend, like,
the next two years--
I'm following this guy, right.
    Wherever he goes, I go.
    Goes to a family reunion,
    "Hello."
I mean, he's in a hotel room
banging some whore,
I'm in the room next door,
you know, with a glass against
the wall, you know, listening.
- That's a little creepy.
    - So--
I mean, this guy takes a piss,
I'm so close, I get tinkled
on my shoes, you know.
        And still nothing.
        We get<i> nothing.</i>
And I can tell that
the guys upstairs are getting
sick and tired of this shit.
        'Cause every time
        I go in they give me
        the "fuck you" eyes...
when I'm handing my card
for overtime.
        But I don't care
        'cause I know.
I know in my gut
that this is the motherfucker
that capped Franklin and Meyers.
And I know I'll never sleep
another night in my life
as long as he's still out there.
    And then the day comes.
<i>Then they tell me,</i>
<i>we're done.</i>
<i>Case is retired.</i>
<i>No more overtime.</i>
<i>We've had two years.</i>
<i>Finito.</i>
        Really?
                    Thank you.
    That was our best?
                        Yeah.
        That's the best?
<i>Fuck them.</i>
<i>I go apeshit.</i>
<i>I'm-I'm destroying shit.</i>
<i>I'm throwing shit.</i>
<i>So there I am.</i>
<i>I'm driving home.</i>
<i>I'm furious.</i>
<i>I'm driving by Spike's,</i>
<i>and that bastard's truck</i>
<i>is sitting there.</i>
<i>He's, you know,</i>
<i>inside having a beer</i>
<i>or whatever,</i>
<i>and my two friends are dead</i>
<i>in a ditch somewhere,</i>
<i>and only that asshole</i>
<i>knows where they're at.</i>
<i>And I sit there...</i>
<i>staring.</i>
<i>And I'm trying to come up</i>
<i>with a plan.</i>
        So, it comes to me.
Did you go in there
and beat the shit out of him?
        You take him outside,
        then you beat
        the shit out of him.
        Nah, you idiots.
        You take him outside.
        You have him beat
        the shit out of himself.
Don't they teach you kids
nothing in the academy anymore?
All right, no.
          You see this?
I'm trying to tell a story,
and all these guys care about
is a cheap laugh.
Hey, let's just remember
there are two dead cops in here.
All right?
Hey, beautiful.
                            Hi.
Hi, I'd like, uh...
whiskey double.
            All right.
And-- You know what?
Double for
my friend here.
                    Thanks.
    My pleasure.
                What are you
                so happy about?
I am celebrating
the greatest day of my life.
            Tell me about it.
All right.
I'm a cop, right?
I've been spending
the last couple years,
every day of my life,
searching for the bodies
of these two buddies of mine...
that got killed by some
heartless bastard, right?
        Nothing.
Then this morning
I found the bodies.
They were out in the woods,
not even that far from here.
    I can finally
    take a vacation.
Hey, give him one more.
And keep the change.
Take care, my friend.
<i>I couldn't have waited</i>
<i>more than 10 minutes,</i>
<i>and here he comes,</i>
<i>he's looking around,</i>
<i>he's all nervous.</i>
<i>He gets into his truck,</i>
<i>and he creeps off.</i>
<i>And I creep off</i>
<i>right behind him.</i>
<i>And then this idiot goes right</i>
<i>into the middle of the woods.</i>
<i>He walks right to a clearing.</i>
<i>Starts stomping around like</i>
<i>he's been missing something.</i>
<i>And after a while, he finally</i>
<i>decides that we must have made</i>
<i>a mistake, and he leaves.</i>
<i>I get on the horn to the chief.</i>
        Hey, Captain.
        This is Cunningham.
        I found them.
    The next day
    we dug those two up.
    That prick's serving
    double life now.
See, that's what it's all about.
    That comes from years
    of being on the job.
    You can't teach that.
    Whole point of poker night,
    young buck.
            You listen,
            you learn, you go
            and you do likewise.
        And you always use
        your best weapon,
    and that's your brain.
    You always
    trust your heart.
    Yeah, thanks
    for that, Confucius.
Getting all teary over here.
    Are we gonna play cards
    or are we just gonna
    shoot the shit?
That's what we're here for.
            All right.
        Time for you
        to lose money.
                    Hey.
    Hey?
I'm not happy
about you being here.
If I had a say,
you wouldn't
be getting this promotion.
            Listen, Maxwell--
Am I wearing
a fucking dress?
Don't interrupt me.
    You knew my rules.
    You broke my rules.
If this all goes wrong,
I'm gonna fuck you up.
Girls doing okay here?
    Fine.
        Just need a few more
        of these in me,
        I'll be right as rain.
You hear anything, Floyd?
            No.
            But I got my cell.
                You know my wife
                threw me out?
        She says
        I'm driving her crazy.
        Short fucking trip.
        Wanna play some cards?
You know how I like taking
your money, don't you?
- I know you like
  taking my money.
- I love taking your money.
I brought extra.
            Good.
            I'm a little short.
Hey, can I borrow
20 before we start?
Of course.
Sit down.
Come on in, gentlemen.
So, this is
how it works, kid.
            You against us.
        We win a hand,
        we tell you a story.
And, uh, you ought to listen up
'cause these stories are worth
a year of street experience.
        So, put yourself
        in our shoes,
you, uh, think like we think,
and then one day when you
find yourself in a bad spot,
    you'll remember
    what we taught you.
Hopefully,
you'll make it out alive.
We were there making mistakes.
        You listen, you learn.
Maybe you don't have
to make the same ones.
    We ain't good for much else
    except these stories.
It's all we got left
to contribute to you young kids.
Speak for yourself,
Calabrese, old bitch.
I'm still out there
kicking ass
and breaking balls.
    I seen you, Calabrese.
    I could limp faster than you
    with Bernard on my back.
            I could take a shit
            faster than you.
Hey. Hey. Fuck all
      you all, motherfuckers.
You grumpy-ass motherf-- I'll
kick all your fucking asses,
right here and right now.
- Aw, shit.
  Come on. Sit down, Calabrese.
- All right. I'll sit down.
You're supposed to get wisdom
as you get older,
not leak it out when you piss.
<i>About 10 years ago, the chief</i>
<i>made a decision to start...</i>
<i>bringing in some heavy hitters.</i>
<i>We're a small town,</i>
<i>but crime was rising.</i>
<i>He figured you bring in</i>
<i>some big city vets</i>
<i>about ready to retire...</i>
<i>and give them</i>
<i>a couple years here</i>
<i>training the rookies,</i>
<i>they might just be able</i>
<i>to stay ahead of the curve.</i>
<i>He brought in some of the best.</i>
<i>Jason Cunningham.</i>
<i>This guy survived</i>
<i>the Richmond drug wars</i>

<i>Incorruptible and unsociable.</i>

<i>A.J. solved over 45 homicides,</i>

<i>Been one of the poker squad</i>

<i>Byron Davis, Chicago PD.</i>
<i>Toughest cop I ever met.</i>
<i>Had an accident four years ago</i>

<i>Floyd Maxwell,</i>
<i>15 years on the front lines.</i>
<i>Doesn't say much,</i>

<i>They call him "the Hawk,"</i>
<i>and the Hawk was watching me.</i>
<i>The lieutenant,</i>
<i>Mike Calabrese.</i>
<i>Maybe the most beloved</i>
<i>senior officer ever.</i>
<i>Always looking out for his men.</i>
<i>Always there to lend a hand.</i>
<i>Last year he saved my life.</i>
    Through the, uh, gravel pit
    up where the--
Shot fired. Shit.
- Get your head
      out of your ass, Jeter!
        Thank you.
        Stay close.
                    Lieutenant.
        I want to say thank you.
    You saved my fucking life.
            No, you did. Y-You--
    I would be dead
    and un-un-under the ground
    if it wasn't for--
Get the fuck out of here
with this sympathetic bullshit.
Crying in your beer.
Somebody want to get
this fucking guy a dress?
    You don't say
    thank you to me.
        You do better.
You come onto the scene
ready for action.
    You pay attention.
    You learn.
And the next time
you help out the new guy.
You save<i> his</i> life.
That's all
the thanks I need.
Hey, boys, get this.
This drunk fuck
wants to buy us all a round.
Hey!
    Go figure.
            So, nurse!
- Here we go.
- How did I get so lucky?
Five card draw. Straight up.
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
- Ah, here it comes.
- Jesus Christ.
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding.
We haven't even started yet
and you're asking a question?
Hey, hey.
                That is not
                how this works.
        We ask the questions,
        we do the talking,
        you do the listening.
Okay, but I'm serious.
I have a question. Just one.
Oh, my God.
Jesus Christ, ask the fucking
question before our pensions
run out, for Christ's sake.
                What if I win?
Listen. Ten years
of playing poker night,
rookie's never won, never will.
Okay, but if I do.
    Say I get that,
    that one great hand.
    What then?
Hey, look here.
If you win, all bets are off.
    All right?
    You tell the stories
    and we start learning.
And we'd be pretty bad cheaters
if we're dealing you good cards.
            All right.
            First lesson.
I wasn't looking
at your card.
            I saw you peeking.
        It's an easy one.
        It's about perspective.
We deal with three percent
of the population
97% of the time.
And now everyone in the world
is not a lowlife, lying,
backstabbing, ass-covering
son of a bitch.
But.
 But it's mostly who we deal with on a daily basis.
    And they all think
    they're smarter than you.
        So here's your lesson.
        - They're not.
        - Except for the ones
          who actually are.
We never catch those bastards.
We just pretend
they don't exist.
<i>But sometimes they do exist.</i>
- <i> The monsters</i>
<i>  from your nightmares.</i>
<i>They're real,</i>
<i>and you can't wake up.</i>
There you are.
So tell me, Detective.
How old are you?
    Twenty-five?
Twenty-six?
Take a little from column A
to fix column B.
Am I right?
        I don't know what
        you're talking about.
I can make us a deal. Okay?
I-I-I got connections.
                    A deal?
        Yeah.
Okay.
I was just like you once.
<i>Just a normal guy</i>
<i>with a normal life...</i>
<i>who went to a normal job</i>
<i>day after day after day.</i>
<i>I was a forecaster, Stan.</i>
<i>Predicting behavior</i>
<i>and regulating change.</i>
<i>Just another one</i>
<i>of the worker bees</i>
<i>buzzing around.</i>
<i>I just never seemed</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>
<i>I got to the point</i>
<i>where I just couldn't</i>
<i>take it anymore, Stan.</i>
<i>I wasn't going to be just</i>
<i>another one of those sheeple...</i>
<i>marching to the beat</i>
<i>of someone else's drum.</i>
<i>So I decided,</i>
<i>right then and there,</i>
<i>I was going</i>
<i>to change my life.</i>
<i>But in order to do that, Stan,</i>
<i>I needed goals.</i>
<i>It took me a while</i>
<i>to be honest with myself.</i>
<i>I had to look into</i>
<i>my inner recesses, Stan.</i>
<i>I had to look deep,</i>
<i>and then I found them.</i>
<i>Two to be exact.</i>
<i>Making the rules was easy.</i>
<i>Crossing the line is what</i>
<i>separates the men from the boys.</i>
<i>But I was diligent.</i>
<i>I was a hard worker.</i>
Well, Stan,
we're gonna have to pick
this up at another time.
- Just wait a second.
  Okay?
- What?
    - Don't have to do that.
    - Yes, I do.
            No, you don't have
            to do that.
            You don't--
            Don't have to--
Sorry, Stan.
Rule number one calls.
        Oh, God, no.
        Amy!
Ow!
Hey, stop! Just leave her alone!
            Hey!
        Hey, kid,
        how you doing?
    Hey.
            You don't
            look so good.
Ah, no. I'm fine.
It's the night shift,
you know,
kicking my ass.
Anything to do with this?
                    Let's talk.
- Hi, Daddy.
        No, it's okay now.
    A nice officer
    is here to take him away.
        Yep.
        Just like you taught me.
        He won't be looking
        in any girls' windows
        anytime soon.
    Nicely done.
Jeter.
Where'd you go?
        - I'm sorry.
        - Look, Stan.
        Just between us.
        You're a good cop.
Could be a great cop.
        So,
    what's the deal with Amy?
            Oh, come on,
            Lieutenant.
            I mean,
            she's just a kid.
All right.
    I just wanted to hear it
    straight from you is all.
                    Hear what?
That there's nothing going on
between the two of you.
        I don't know anything,
        Lieutenant.
                I'm telling you
                the truth.
Something's going on.
I know she's been calling here,
asking for you.
            Jeter.
<i>Hi, Officer Jeter?</i>
    <i> This is Amy.</i>
Hi, Amy.
Listen, you can't call me here.
<i>I know. I know.</i>
<i>I was just thinking.</i>
<i>Maybe you could</i>
<i>take me on a drive along?</i>
<i>You know,</i>
<i>give me a firsthand peek into</i>
<i>the world of law enforcement.</i>
Um, yeah,
I don't think your dad
would be too happy about that.
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>You're not afraid of my dad,</i>
<i>are you?</i>
<i>Besides, I can do what I want.</i>
<i>I'm an adult.</i>
        Almost an adult.
<i>Oh, come on, Stan.</i>
<i>It'll be fun.</i>
<i>Besides, if you don't</i>
<i>pick me up, who knows what</i>
<i>kind of trouble I might get in.</i>
<i>Someone's gonna</i>
<i>call the cops either way.</i>
            I don't know.
    Oh, me too.
    I just like the spirit,
    you know?
Like, everyone's happy
and there's lights.
It's pretty.
    Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.
And--
I need to know.
I don't want any
stinking trouble, not on
this department, not on you.
You got me?
    I'm telling you the truth,
    Lieutenant.
            I never saw her.
Don't let it
hit the fan, Jeter.
You're a hero cop,
you're gonna make detective
next week.
        Don't give 'em any dirt.
Stan?
Stan,
can you hear me?
    Yeah!
    - Oh, thank God.
    - Are you okay?
Please.
We have to get out of here.
How long have you been here?
    The whole time.
    - How did he get you?
    - I got a call.
<i>He said you were in trouble.</i>
Are you?
    Yeah, yeah.
    Come on. Let's go. Get in.
    Listen.
    I don't just get
    in the car with strangers.
    All right.
    Look, you see this blood?
    Huh? He doesn't
    have much more time. Okay?
            He's asking for you.
            Let's go.
<i>Wait. Wait a minute.</i>
<i>He knows that I know you?</i>
<i>But you found me, Stan.
</i> <i>They must know</i> <i>where we are, right?</i>
No, I got a call on the radio.
    A domestic.
    Five miles up the road.
    My phone didn't work.
But I've been gone
for two weeks.
Aren't there any leads at all?
                    No, they--
            They thought
            I might be involved.
Please, Stan,
you have to stop him.
He comes in here--
I know this is hard.
Okay, I do.
        I'm gonna try to think
        of a way out.
        Can you get free?
    No.
    No, I tried.
    I tried everything.
                        I can't.
    If we're gonna get out,
    we've got to get out
    when he's gone.
    - Wait. He's gone?
    - Yeah, he-- he's gone.
    He leaves sometimes.
    He leaves--
    I can hear his car leave.
All right.
I need you to listen carefully.
You tell me if you
hear anything. I need to know
if he comes back, okay?
                        Okay.
    All right. You deal, gimpy.
Watch it, tough guy.
I'm gonna shove my gimp cane
up your ass.
Yeah. You'd have to
            catch me first.
I've never been on your back.
Excuse me.
            Hello?
        Yeah, any news?
        Okay.
            It's in the study.
    Yeah, I can come back if--
    Okay.
All right, thanks.
Bye.
        It's all gonna be okay.
        Don't worry.
        What's the game?
Texas Hold'em.
All right, so listen up.
You got to try
to put yourself in our shoes.
Try to picture the story.
    What would you do?
    What would you think?
Her name was Misty.
<i>If you can't think it,</i>
<i>you can't see it.</i>
If you can't see it,
you can't learn.
                Do you see it?
    Oh, yeah.
            Then walk the scene.
Officers.
Hey, where's our vic?
                    In there.
That way.
        Jim, you got
        an extra pair of gloves?
        There you go.
                    As usual.
<i>This is the big one.</i>
<i>Murder.</i>
<i>You look at the body</i>
<i>for a real long time.</i>
Till it's burned
into your head.
Without you,
whoever did this gets away.
You're responsible
for avenging her.
You're doing God's work now.
<i>The place was a mess.</i>
<i>DNA everywhere.</i>
<i>This guy was</i>
<i>the Old Faithful of sperm.</i>
<i>We had the evidence.</i>
<i>Now we needed the match.</i>
<i>So the investigation started,</i>
<i>but it never stopped.</i>
<i>Started with family, friends,</i>
<i>boyfriends, coworkers.</i>
<i>I lost track at 100 guys.</i>
<i>One year stretched into three.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>Her parents kept calling me,</i>
<i>wanting updates.</i>
<i>There was nothing to tell.</i>
<i>But I was gonna catch this guy.</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna let this one go.</i>
<i>I promised them I wouldn't quit.</i>
<i>Eight years later,</i>
<i>a handyman gets called</i>
<i>for a broken furnace.</i>
<i>Something's blocking a vent.</i>
And boom. Guess what pops out.
<i>Panties.</i>
Loads of fucking panties.
<i>So here's how it works.</i>
<i>Those panties had sperm</i>
<i>all over them.</i>
<i>The sperm on the panties</i>
<i>matched the sperm</i>
<i>all over Misty's house.</i>
<i>Whoever juked on the panties</i>
<i>was the same person</i>
<i>who killed Misty.</i>
<i>The house the panties</i>
<i>were found in...</i>
<i>was a rental property about</i>
<i>three blocks away from Misty.</i>
<i>Going back eight years,</i>
<i>we found out who lived there.</i>
<i>A wannabe actor.</i>
<i>But the closest he ever</i>
<i>got to the film business</i>
<i>was working here.</i>
<i>All I needed was a swab.</i>
<i>But the way</i>
<i>he was looking at me--</i>
<i>He must have been waiting</i>
<i>his whole life</i>
<i>for me to show up.</i>
<i>He must have lived his life</i>
<i>in fear that someday,</i>
<i>somehow his secret would out.</i>
<i>And he wasn't going down</i>
<i>without a fight.</i>
Hey! Freeze!
I said stop!
                    Hey, stop!
                            Hey!
                Stop! Stop!
    Sorry!
    Hey, police!
    Move.
    Jesus.
    Fuck.
                        Hey!
                    Hey, stop!
            Stay down!
                Shit.
Hey, get out of the car!
                        Ah.
<i>That was it for me.</i>
<i>Last run. Never walk</i>
<i>without a cane again.</i>
<i>But I wasn't done fighting.</i>
<i>I'd been chasing this guy</i>
<i>for eight years.</i>
<i>I wasn't gonna lose him now.</i>
<i>And that's how you get 'em.</i>
- Same as I got you bastards.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!
            Son of a bitch.
The race doesn't always
go to the swiftest.
                        Dang.
You take your time.
You build your case.
And you--
Never, ever give up.
- Go fuck yourself.
-     Look, it's true.
Fuckin' bumper sticker.
    Why does Davis solve
    all his cases with panties?
Why do all yours get solved
by naked sweaty boy informants?
    - I stick with what I know.
    - Reminds me
      of Maxwell's story.
Okay.
We're gonna just play cards,
thank you very much.
                    All right.
Oh, no. Come on.
Tell that story.
    Come on.
            Come on.
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>The big moment.</i>
<i>Carpe diem.</i>
<i>Make it happen.</i>
<i>Don't give up.</i>
                Ah.
    Ah. Shit.
        Ah.
        Fuck. Shit.
Ah, fuck. Oh.
                    Fuck.
                    Amy?
Stan!
- Amy?
- Can you hear me?
- Amy!
- Stan!
    Follow my voice.
Stan!
Can you hear me?
Yeah. I can hear you.
Follow my voice.
Where are you?
I'm over here! In here!
Stan?
                Amy?
Stan!
Please.
                Oh, my God. Oh.
                Are you okay?
                What happened?
    Yeah, yeah.
                What happened?
Hold on. Stop.
Oh.
            The giant thing--
                It doesn't work.
                It doesn't work.
You gotta get me out.
You gotta get me out of here.
Okay, Amy.
        You gotta get me out--
Listen to me, okay?
I can't pull these chains out.
I need to find some tools.
I need to call the police
and get 'em over here.
I'm gonna go upstairs
for a second.
                    No, no, no.
    You can't leave me.
    He's gonna come back. He's--
If I don't get something
to break you out,
he's going to kill us both.
        Okay?
Okay. I'll be back. I promise.
                Okay.
    You fucking--
                Shit.
                    Fuck.
Ah!
<i>I had my chance.</i>
<i>I had my chance, and I took it.</i>
<i>No one could fault me for that.</i>
<i>But I knew it</i>
<i>would be a cold day before</i>
<i>I would get that chance again.</i>
<i>Now I had more important things</i>
<i>on my mind than escape.</i>
<i>I just needed to concentrate</i>
<i>on staying alive.</i>
                    Ah!
            Stan!
Ah.
                Oh.
            Game is called
            Chase the Queen.
    Which I'm sure
    you're all used to doing.
    The queen and anything
    comes after is wild.
        Two down, one up,
    two up, one down, one up.
    Ugh.
    Hand of crap.
Queens and wilds.
I can't keep track of this shit.
        Hey, Bernard.
        Why don't you just start
        your story, okay?
So I can go take a piss.
    It was 1979.
                    Holy shit.
        In '79
        I was still in diapers.
    Back then, they didn't give
    you guns, right?
You just had a club. You hit
the bad guy over the head and
then drag him back to your cave?
            '79--
            I was still married
            to my first wife.
Oh, yeah, Cleopatra.
        It was 1979.
        We had a double murder.
        Gruesome double murder.
                No witnesses,
                one suspect.
                        The son.
                        Shawn.
            Just give me a call.
            If you go anywhere,
            give me a call,
            let me know.
        Oh, okay.
        I will.
                You feel that?
    I don't think
    I'm going anywhere.
    - Feel what?
    - Something's not right.
- That's all.
              Thanks, sir.
It's not what they say.
It's what they don't say.
    Okay, so what should I do?
Help him find the words.
                Hey, kid!
                Hey.
        Y-Yeah?
                Hold up.
                Hey, come here.
        Uh, okay.
        Just wanted to ask you
        a couple more questions.
I told the detective
everything I know.
He's said I could go.
            It's in the eyes.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know.
I know, I just thought
we might walk it over
one more time.
It'll just take
a few minutes.
Sure, I guess.
I mean, should I have
a lawyer or something?
                    There it is.
        I guess if I had
        something to hide, sure,
        I'd want a lawyer.
But if you've done
    nothing wrong.
            That's up to you.
            You think
            you need a lawyer?
    N-N-No.
    I-I guess not.
            All right.
            Well, then let's go.
    Go?
        Take him on the drive.
                The drive?
                Oh, my God.
                Not the drive.
Jones had the cup of coffee.
Douglas had the crying corner.
                A.J. Bernard?
                Long drive.
    Well, he needs a long drive.
If the drive was any shorter,
he wouldn't figure
a goddamn thing out.
It's-- It's true.
        It was 1979.
    Silence was a part of it.
    But it could also
    gives you time to think.
        Time to get inside
        their heads a bit.
    Figure out what happened.
    Wait.
    Why are we here?
You said--
You said we were going
to my Grandma's house.
    Just want to walk it
    through with you again,
    like you told us bit by bit.
    I just want to go.
                I know,
                just once more.
                        Please.
            Fine.
            Here's the thing.
    Killers all have a reason.
        If you know the reason,
        you're halfway home.
<i>They just want you</i>
<i>to understand them.</i>
<i>They did those things</i>
<i>with a purpose.</i>
<i>You understand the reason--</i>
Go on.
            you found your guy.
Take me back there, Shawn.
What'd you see?
<i>Here's the thing about this job.</i>
<i>There is no bottom.</i>
<i>Just when you think</i>
<i>you've seen it all,</i>
<i>the bottom falls out.</i>
            There is no worst.
        Just new levels of hell.
What happened?
    Shawn?
Tell me what happened.
        I-- I came in,
        and someone was
        beating them.
Who?
Who was it, Shawn?
They were good people.
Who would want to kill
your mom and dad?
No, they weren't what you think.
What am I supposed to think?
You told me
they were good parents.
Now why would someone
kill these good people?
    Y-You didn't know them.
        - They--
        - They what?
Open it!
Open the door right now!
<i>They yell at you?</i>
<i>They beat you?</i>
<i>Mommy hold you</i>
<i>a bit too close?</i>
        Yeah.
        They did it all.
What were you gonna
      do about it, Shawn?
        Were you gonna let them
        get away with treating
        you like that?
I can see why you did
what you had to do, Shawn.
This couldn't go on
like this forever.
- Now tell me what happened.
- Tell me, Shawn.
        Tell me what happened.
                    Ah!
No!
        Ah!
    Ah!
    I killed them!
        It was me.
        I killed them.
        You don't always
        get what you want.
        I got a broken jaw
        and 18 stitches.
    But I got the confession.
    Sometimes you pay a price
    for justice.
How you doing, buddy?
Come here.
        It's okay. I'm here.
        It's okay. It's okay.
<i>In my line of work--</i>
                You all right?
<i>I see things.</i>
            Who did this to you?
You ain't got nothing on me,
motherfucker!
                Calm down, man!
    - I'm fuckin' doing it!
    - No, no, no!
<i>Bad things.</i>
<i>Things that shouldn't be seen.</i>
                        Food.
<i>When you're faced</i>
<i>with this every day,</i>
<i>you find ways to deal with it.</i>
<i>It might not be the best ways.</i>
<i>At the academy, we were told</i>
<i>that we work for God.</i>
<i>That we are the last line</i>
<i>of defense to protect the world</i>
<i>from the tyranny of evil men.</i>
<i>And I remember thinking</i>
<i>that sounded stupid.</i>
            Ah.
<i>I don't now.</i>
<i>Now I know what evil looks like.</i>
<i>I've seen it</i>
<i>up close and personal.</i>
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.
            What the hell
            did you do to me?
<i>And I can never look</i>
<i>at things the same again.</i>
                Oh!
                Ah. Ah.
Do you know...
            how many tubes
            of Krazy Glue
            it takes to...
                hold a man
                to a wall?
        Would you believe 34?
            A lot more
            than I thought too.
Please, just tell me
what you want.
I'll do everything I can.
Shut up.
        Please, there must be
        something you need.
Now you were close.
    So close.
The next time
you try to escape,
it's gonna hurt.
Really hurt.
Oh, you don't believe me?
Here.
                        Ah!
See what I mean?
            You're sick!
Thank you.
Leave him alone!
    Oh.
So touching.
She really
likes you.
Too bad
she's jailbait.
Just-- Just let her go, okay?
        It's me you want, right?
We have more in common
than I thought, Detective.
Although...
I think
she's too old for me.
        Why are you doing this?
        Why?
        Uh, where's this going?
Don't try and be smart.
I'm always five moves
ahead of you.
You see what
I want you to see.
You know what
I want you to know.
While you're
playing catch up,
I'm already planning next month.
Hey, wait-- wait a second.
        What about your family?
        Huh?
        Why did you kill them?
        You're so transparent.
            But sure. Why not?
    Where were we?
<i>Oh, yes, my new goals.</i>
<i>If you really</i>
<i>want to kill people...</i>
<i>and you really want</i>
<i>to get away with it,</i>
<i>then you need</i>
<i>to do a little research.</i>
<i>Now where do you go to learn</i>
<i>sick things like that?</i>
<i>The Discovery Channel</i>
<i>of course.</i>
<i>The have a whole channel</i>
<i>just devoted to murder.</i>
<i>It was like watching TV</i>
<i>to get a PhD in murder.</i>
<i>And the Internet.</i>
<i>A world of debauchery</i>
<i>right at your fingertips.</i>
<i>Everything you ever wanted</i>
<i>to know about anything</i>
<i>sick and twisted,</i>
<i>available at a keystroke.</i>
<i>Night after night</i>
<i>I was learning more.</i>
<i>Arguing.</i>
<i>Sharing knowledge.</i>
<i>It was like being a member</i>
<i>in the most exclusive club ever.</i>
<i>I was liberated.</i>
<i>I didn't feel alone</i>
<i>for the first time in my life.</i>
<i>But...</i>
<i>I needed something more.</i>
<i>Someone to share with,</i>
<i>to learn from,</i>
<i>to help me sharpen my skills.</i>
<i>I needed a mentor.</i>
<i>It was everything</i>
<i>I ever hoped for and more.</i>
<i>Someone who got me,</i>
<i>understood me,</i>
<i>where I was coming from.</i>
<i>He helped me be the man</i>
<i>I am today.</i>
<i>To be all I could be.</i>
- <i> But there comes a time</i>
<i>  when you have to grow up.</i>
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>when you kill your parents,</i>
<i>and you leave the house.</i>
What a dipshit.
<i>That time came,</i>
<i>and that's when I knew</i>
<i>I was ready.</i>
<i> Ready to be on my own again.</i>
What happened to your mentor?
        And you call yourself
        a detective?
        Enough about me.
        Let's talk about you.
I see potential in you,
Detective.
You're a lot like me.
Trapped.
Well, you saw what I had
to do to break free.
And I want you to do the same.
                    Please.
                Just let me go.
Let yourself go.
    Free yourself.
I want you to think
about something, Detective.
    Why you?
Out of everyone.
        Why you?
Do you think you have what
it takes to go up against me?
You think you're smart enough?
I don't think so.
I think you fall short.
        Way short.
Game's almost over, Detective.
You know,
I've been thinking.
You know,
what's going on here is, uh,
    it's not right.
I used you to catch
the detective
and now that I have him,
I don't really
need you anymore.
I have a sickness,
and, uh,
    I see that now.
And I can't keep doing this.
So what I want is for you
to call your family...
    and tell them that
    you're all right,
    and tell them
    to come get you.
Okay?
                    What?
            Oh, but--
            All right.
All right. So.
            Here.
                    Daddy?
                Can you hear me?
                Yes, I'm alive.
    He wants you to come get me.
    He said he's gonna let me--
                    Ah!
No.
Dad.
    Hello, Amy's dad?
    How are you today?
        Oh, I wouldn't talk like
        that if I were you.
Stop!
        You do realize I have
        your daughter, right?
Daddy!
Don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him!
Da--
Get off!
            Yeah, that was her.
    All right.
    So this is gonna be simple.
    You're gonna take $10,000.
    You're gonna get in your car
    and you're gonna
    drive up River Road.
You're gonna drive 5.2 miles,
and you're gonna head up
to the house there. You got it?
3:00 pm. And no cops.
And I mean no cops
or your daughter
comes back dead and pregnant.
That's it for me, boyos.
Cash me out.
    What are you talking about?
    It's 11:30.
Yeah, you're not going anywhere
till we hear our favorite story.
    Give me a fucking break.
                    No, no, no.
You're gonna stay right here
and tell us a sexy little story.
    - I get all tingly
      just thinking about it.
    - I bet you are.
            Floyd. Come on.
    I'm out of Viagra.
    The little woman's
    been begging for it.
        I need you, bro.
You guys are assholes.
        Thirty-five years
        on the fucking job,
highly-decorated detective,
you think I only got one story?
    I got a million.
    Here, there's one.
I had this guy--
            No!
Hey! No! Nope.
        Come on. Tell it, Floyd.
- We want<i> the</i> story.
- You want<i> the</i> story?
        Yeah,<i> the</i> story.
                        Yeah!
For your own
fucking perverse pleasure--
                All right.
                    Thank you.
I will indulge you...
        in a tale
        of fine police work.
And whatnot.
    It was a little ways back.
    I had a little less gray
    in my hair.
    I might have been wearing
    a Members Only jacket,
    I'm not sure.
Bottom line is,
there were three bodies.
            One in the water.
<i>One in the woods.</i>
            One in the Dumpster.
<i>Now this was a big deal</i>
<i>at the time...</i>
<i>because this was</i>
<i>the first serial killer</i>
<i>in the area, right?</i>
<i>Each of the victims was killed</i>
<i>in a different place.</i>
<i>But all of them were missing</i>
<i>their pinkies.</i>
<i>So we called this guy</i>
<i>"the pinky thief."</i>
<i>All the victims though,</i>
<i>they were hustlers, right?</i>
<i>Guys selling themselves</i>
<i>out to the highest bidder.</i>
<i>But the one common thing was,</i>
<i>each of 'em was afraid</i>
<i>of the same guy.</i>
<i>This asshole named Nate Munson.</i>
<i>He's some bullshit photographer,</i>
<i>right?</i>
<i>He would lure 'em</i>
<i>into his world,</i>
<i>you know, with the promise</i>
<i>of glamour pictures, right?</i>
<i>'Cause they're all</i>
<i>aspiring models,</i>
<i>fucking actors and whatnot.</i>
<i>So we liked this guy</i>
<i>for all these killings.</i>
Oh, such a nice night.
He would lead them into
the woods to his own little
personal lovers' lane place...
        that he'd staked out.
Oh, watch your step.
It's slippery on this moss.
        We thought
        he killed them there,
            then disposed
            of the bodies later.
I don't see anything here
that says that
this is our guy.
- This is our guy.
<i>- We know this is our guy.</i>
- I know it is. I can feel it.
<i>- But each scene is too clean.</i>
<i>We can't bring him in</i>
<i>without evidence.</i>
<i>He'll take a fucking walk.</i>
    But if we're right,
    and he kills someone else,
we're gonna catch hell
in the press when they find out
that we knew about the guy...
        and he went on killing.
        So there's only one way
        to do this right.
<i>Someone had to go undercover.</i>
        I drew the short straw.
<i>They wired me up,</i>
<i>and the go word is,</i>
<i>"You're making me hot."</i>
<i>"You're making me hot."</i>
                        Wow.
<i>Poor choice of words.</i>
<i>It comes from upstairs.</i>
<i>They make the unfortunate</i>
<i>fucking tactical decision...</i>
<i>to link us up with</i>
<i>some local SWAT team.</i>
<i>These guys were fucking</i>
<i>world-class bozos, right?</i>
<i>Shit-bird number one.</i>
<i>Shit-bird number two.</i>
<i>Shit-bird number three.</i>
    Here, that's you.
    Sniper two, Johnson, there.
Snipers had me triangulated,
ready to put this fuck in the
ground first sign of craziness.
            Nice.
                    Whoa, hey.
The guy's fucking feeling me up
and I'm thinking to myself,
this better be the fucking guy,
all right? You know?
Because if this guy's just in it
for the fucking sex,
    he's never gonna see
    a jail cell...
'cause I'm gonna take him out
right there on the spot.
<i>So after a while he starts</i>
<i>getting rough.</i>
Handcuffs.
    Oh, hey. Hey.
    - What is that?
    - Who's in charge now, huh?
What are you doing?
Huh? Come here, come here,
come here, come here.
                        Hey.
Ah, yeah.
Yes. You're kinky.
You're fuckin' kinky.
            Come on.
Now you're fucking--
You're making me hot.
            Why don't we get--
    - You're making me hot.
    - Why don't we--
You're making me hot.
Yeah, you're making me hot!
You're-- You're making me--
        Oh, shit!
Hey, you're making me hot!
<i>Shit-bird number one has been</i>
<i>on the phone with his wife.</i>
<i>They're having a fight.</i>
<i>Shit-bird number two catches</i>
<i>some kids smoking pot.</i>
<i>Shit-bird number three</i>
<i>ate Mexican for lunch</i>
<i>and he's got the fucking runs.</i>
You're ma--
You're making me hot!
Hey, hey.
You're making me hot.
Uh.
So at this point,
Munson moves behind me,
and I know he's gonna
cut my finger off.
I realize that
I'm on my own, right?
There's gonna be no back up.
So I do the one sensible thing
that any man would do.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
W-W-Wait. Come here.
Come here.
        I asked for a kiss.
Give me a kiss.
Huh?
Turns you on?
                Yeah. Fuck it.
Come here.
    Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Come on.
Oh, yeah.
        - He's down.
        - Move!
Hey, where the fuck were you?
Fuckin' piece of shit.
Come on!
<i>Bottom line.</i>
    If you're in the shit,
    you're all you got,
you make your fucking play.
You're right.
It's a lesson, kid.
And if all else fails--
        Ask for a kiss!
                Don't move,
                motherfucker.
Okay. Okay.
                    Right there.
    Get your fucking hands up.
                    Okay, okay.
Get 'em up.
Where's my daughter?
                    What do--
Where is she?
                What do you mean
                your daughter?
        I don't know what
        you're talking about.
Don't fuck with me
or I will smoke you.
You tell me where she is now.
    Okay, don't. I don't know
    what's going on here, man.
        I-- You know, I was just
        walking my dog,
    and I saw you at the house
    and I just came to tell you
    that nobody's home, okay?
                They're away.
                They're away.
Don't give me that.
You called me on my cell phone,
you piece of shit.
        - Where is she?
        - Don't. Please.
            Just listen, okay?
        I don't know
        what's going on here.
I don't know
what you're talking about.
But please don't kill me, okay?
        Don't-- Don't kill me.
        I got kids too.
You fuck--
                        Please.
                        Please.
Oh, shit.
Shit. Fuck.
I'm sorry.
Put your hand down.
Put your hand--
Stand up.
You all right?
                        Yeah.
    Shit.
    I'm sorry.
    I'm sorry.
            Fuck.
                Are you okay?
                I mean--
        You should really call
        the cops or something.
        They can help.
I am the cops.
                            Oh.
                    It's okay.
        Hey, you know,
        I'm sure everything's
        gonna turn out fine.
You know.
    I hope you find your kid.
Thanks. Look, I'm sorry
about that back there.
                        Yeah.
Thanks for your help.
                        Yeah.
                    No problem.
                    Ah.
Come on.
Stan. Stan, can you hear me?
Yeah.
            Stan! Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Is he here?
Have you been down?
            No, he left.
            He left.
            He called my dad.
What are you doing?
        Stan, what's going on
        in there?
What did he do to you?
                    No. No.
Get behind the bed.
Get--
Sit.
            You move, you die.
            All right?
                        Shit.
Amy!
I had a rough day at work today.
        I could use something
        to relax me.
        I think you know
        just what it is.
            No, don't! Stop!
        Stop it!
No!
                    No! Don't!
That was dumb, Detective.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
                    You fucker!
        What's wrong?
            Hmm?
    Oh, it's not that bad.
Shit!
You're gonna pay for that.
<i>I've pulled my gun three times</i>
<i>in the line of duty,</i>
<i>with mixed results.</i>
<i>One.</i>
<i>Two.</i>
<i>The third is really</i>
<i>the story of my career.</i>
<i>It all starts with a call.</i>
<i>A strange one this time,</i>
<i>a guy named Fisher.</i>
<i>He works at</i>
<i>this trailer storage facility.</i>
<i>Now it seems last month</i>
<i>his phone bill goes up 700%.</i>
<i>No clue why.</i>
It's not 3,700 cents.
It's 3,700 fuckin' dollars!
Okay.
It's a fucking phone bill!
It's not a fucking mortgage
payment, for Christ's sake!
<i>And all of a sudden, he's billed</i>
<i>for seven lines and hundreds</i>
<i>of international calls.</i>
<i>First, he thinks it's Johnson,</i>
<i>a manager who works there,</i>
<i>runnin' up some</i>
<i>phone sex numbers.</i>
<i>But the calls are there</i>
<i>whether Johnson is or not.</i>
<i>Phone company won't help him.</i>
<i>They say they have invoices,</i>
<i>invoices with his signature,</i>
<i>and the signature looked good.</i>
<i>It matched.</i>
<i>Fisher swears it's not his.</i>
<i>I told him I'd look around.</i>
<i>Might be some kids</i>
<i>tying into the line somewhere</i>
<i>and messing around.</i>
<i>Anyway, it beats sitting</i>
<i>in the car.</i>
<i>Quiet night.</i>
<i>It's nice out.</i>
<i>Good night for a walk.</i>
<i>Full moon.</i>
<i>And something struck me.</i>
<i>I don't know what.</i>
<i>But I wondered what things</i>
<i>would look like from the top</i>
<i>of those cars looking down.</i>
<i>I just decided to go</i>
<i>for a climb.</i>
<i>I've replayed that night</i>
<i>thousands of times.</i>
<i>It was the turning point</i>
<i>in my career.</i>
<i>And the truth was...</i>
<i>it was all luck.</i>
<i>Some people work</i>
<i>to get where they are.</i>
<i>Some people marry into it.</i>
            Fuck.
<i>And I got here by climbing up</i>
<i>a bunch of train cars</i>
<i>to look at the moon.</i>
            Jesus!
<i>I can't describe what I saw</i>
<i>that night.</i>
<i>I would never have thought</i>
<i>the things there</i>
<i>were even possible.</i>
<i>When I close my eyes,</i>
<i>the pictures are still there,</i>
<i>haunting me.</i>
        Fuck.
This is good.
                Real good.
Police! Freeze!
<i>Terrence Alby.</i>
<i>I had just shot Terrence Alby.</i>
<i>Never had fired a gun</i>
<i>at a person till then.</i>
<i>And I killed him.</i>
<i>They called me a hero.</i>
<i>They made me a detective.</i>
<i>But I really had nothing</i>
<i>to do with it.</i>
<i>I was just lucky.</i>
<i>I wanted to see the moon.</i>
<i>Three times I pulled my gun.</i>
<i>But I had never, ever,</i>
<i>shot and killed an innocent man.</i>
<i>Until today.</i>
    Jesus Christ.
    What the fuck?
    Don't get up,
    you lazy fucking bastard.
If you wanted to lose weight,
you should've just
quit drinking.
    All right.
    You're gonna be fine.
Let's just get some back up
and get you
the fuck out of here.
Goddamn it.
I knew something was wrong.
    Fucking guy.
Can I help you?
        Uh, Detective Calabrese,
        Warsaw PD.
    Uh, we're going door-to-door
    in the neighborhood.
Well, it's not much
of a neighborhood.
The next house is three miles.
                You okay there?
Oh, yeah.
I just have a cold.
Still contagious.
                We, uh--
        We had a detective
        go missing a couple
        of weeks ago. Jeter?
Mmm. Yeah, yeah.
I've been following the story.
                        Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh, he was working in the area,
on call.
            Oh.
Well, I haven't
seen anything here.
        No cars?
        No suspicious people?
    Nobody coming to the door
    you didn't know?
You mean, besides you?
    Yeah, well, thanks
    for your time, Mister, uh--
James.
    Uh, you mind if I come in?
        Why?
        Just a routine check.
You got a routine warrant?
        Do I need to get one?
        Nope.
Hey, do you have a partner
in that car outside?
                        Why?
Well, I was gonna
put on a pot of coffee.
Wanted to know
how many cups to make.
                    Nope.
                    Just me.
Please, come in.
            We got a 911 call
            about a week ago.
911.
Please state your emergency.
<i>When the operator</i>
<i>picked up the call,</i>
<i>there was nobody there.</i>
            Hello?
So is that unusual?
                Not really.
        But, uh, when she went
        to end the call,
        she missed the button.
    She was, uh, deeply immersed
    in an article
    about the Kardashians.
Anyway, she didn't realize that
the call was still connected.
Hello?
        Sir?
Hello? Can you hear me?
<i>So what happened?</i>
Well, finally the call ended.
But not the story.
            No, not the story.
            We traced the call.
        I mean,
        it was a partial trace.
    Strangely enough, that call
    was made from somewhere
    in this neighborhood.
Uh-huh. Interesting.
                    Yeah.
    And then, uh, cops came out
    here about a week ago,
    do a little follow-up work.
    One of 'em never came back.
So that's two down,
somewhere out here.
                Yeah.
    Jeter, somewhere out here.
        And, uh, that call
        from somewhere out here.
            And then another cop
            goes missing from
            somewhere out here.
There's just so many questions.
    Anyway, I figured I should
    probably check it out and--
    Goddamn cell phones.
    You can never get
    a fucking signal.
                    Is he dead?
        Who?
                The man.
                Is he dead?
<i>No, no.</i>
<i>No, he's still alive.</i>
<i>But I tagged him pretty good.</i>
<i>He's not going anywhere.</i>
            What did you use?
Fuck!
    What?
    I used my .45.
        No. To keep him there.
        What did you use?
    Handcuffs.
<i>Never, ever,</i>
<i>in my wildest dreams.</i>
<i>This is not how it's supposed</i>
<i>to happen. I-If I would</i>
<i>have said something.</i>
<i>Anything. I knew in my heart</i>
<i>the cuffs weren't enough.</i>
<i>I was just too slow.</i>
<i>Too damn slow.</i>
<i>This can't be happening.</i>
            - Shit!
            - You bastard!
            Fuck!
        You-- No!
                    Do it!
    Fellas, read 'em and weep.
Oh, fuck me.
                    Goddamn it.
    Full house.
    Aces wild.
    You called it.
            Hang on, hang on.
        We ain't seen
        what the kid's got yet.
You mind, kid?
                Deuce.
    Another deuce.
        No help there.
    Oh, shit.
The plot thickens.
        And--
No!
            Come on!
<i>Oh, man!</i>
<i>Damn!</i>
                Kid beat you
                with four twos.
Twos? What the fuck?
Who was dealing?
                    Holy shit.
    You know what this means?
                        Huh?
                What?
You get to ask
the questions, kid.
                This is insane.
            You're dead,
            for Christ sakes.
- You too, Maxwell.
- Yeah, they're both dead.
What we want to know is,
did they die for nothing?
    No, you don't know.
You weren't trapped in this
fucking room for weeks.
You sit there and-and you smoke
your cigarette and you tell me
these stories,
but h-h-how the fuck
is this gonna help me?
I have done everything I can.
I can't get out if I'm stuck
to the fucking wall!
Take it one step
at a time, Jeter.
    One step.
You gotta rescue my daughter.
You put this motherfucker
in the ground. Put a stake
in his fucking heart.
Whatever you do,
do not give up.
Hey, you are in a fight.
So fucking fight.
I just-- I just gotta--
I just want this to stop.
        Come on, kid.
        Figure it out.
        You got all the clues.
        You just got
        to string them together.
    What the fuck are you
    talking about, clues?
    The guy, he comes in here
    and drugs me and beats
    the shit out of me.
Think about it.
He grabbed Amy to get to you.
    She disappeared
    two weeks before you did.
    He had a plan.
<i>This place,</i>
<i>middle of nowhere.</i>
<i>The rooms in the basement--</i>
<i>that took a lot of work.</i>
<i>It's no random accident.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>He set this up for you.</i>
<i>You're the one he wants.</i>
    Just stop it.
    Please, just-- Just stop it.
    He could have
    killed you right away.
    But he didn't, all right?
        So think about it.
        Why did he let you live?
    He's trying
    to tell you something.
He wants you to figure it out.
                I can't do this.
            Yes, you can!
        Now you think about it.
        What's the key?
        He said you already knew
        what it was.
    How am I supposed to find
    the key when I don't know
    who this guy is, huh?
        The mentor.
There you go.
<i>I had no idea who he was.</i>
<i>Without the mask,</i>
<i>he was simply no one.</i>
            Now tell me.
            Tell me why this?
            Why me?
What? Because of Alby?
Because I killed your mentor?
        Very good, Detective.
    I knew if
    I spelled it out for you,
    you'd catch on eventually.
        Just took longer than
        I anticipated.
Yeah, but why all this,
you sick fuck?
    Because in that train car
    was my life's work.
<i>I did it all for him.</i>
<i>To please him.</i>
<i>I was shipping that car out</i>
<i>the next day.</i>
<i>Moving on to California</i>
<i>where they really appreciate</i>
<i>people in my profession.</i>
<i>I wanted him to see it</i>
<i>before I left.</i>
<i>To show him that I was a man.</i>
<i>You robbed me of that.</i>
<i>All my crimes, wiped away,</i>
<i>assigned to a corpse.</i>
<i>The corpse of a man</i>
<i>I surpassed in every way.</i>
<i>I had a rough time after that.</i>
<i>I couldn't get out of bed.</i>
<i>I wouldn't take my calls.</i>
            Go away!
- Hey.
-     Hey. How you doing?
<i>My friends, they took me out,</i>
<i>tried to introduce me to girls.</i>
            He's in the back,
            right there.
                He sure is nice.
        Is your mom around? No?
<i>Nothing.</i>
<i>And then it comes to me.</i>
<i>I needed to go back</i>
<i>to the beginning.</i>
<i>When things were more simple,</i>
<i>more clearer.</i>
<i>My goal statement.</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>
<i>Now let me think.</i>
<i>Who stands in my way?</i>
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>Detective Stan Jeter.</i>
<i>The man who stole</i>
<i>my greatest moment of triumph.</i>
<i>Now that man had to pay.</i>
        Well, bravo, Detective.
    You have all the answers.
        Too bad you don't have
        much time left.
What are you talking about?
You didn't think I could take
care of this all by myself,
did you?
Oh, no.
Too many loose ends for one man.
I have my own apprentice now.
        And he should be here
        any minute.
                    Amy?
Amy, can you hear me?
Amy. Amy. Oh, Amy.
        Oh, shit.
            Amy, wake up.
            Amy. Amy, wake up.
Come on.
- Okay.
-     We're getting out of here.
<i>Stop it!</i>
        <i> No! Stop!</i>
            I'm in here!
No surrender! Let's move in!
    - Police, I need help!
    - Drop the weapon!
Guys, I said I need help!
    Somebody help!
    Keep Amy breathing!
    - Drop your weapon!
    - No, he's in the basement!
<i>So that was my story.</i>
<i>Wish I could say</i>
<i>it had a happy ending.</i>
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>I don't know if they mean shit.</i>
<i>Because he was right.</i>
<i>People see</i>
<i>what they want to see.</i>
- So that's it?
- Pretty much.
Hard to argue with that much
physical evidence.
Three dead cops,
two killed with bullets
from my gun.
Kind of hard to talk your way
out of that one.
And the kiddy porn thing.
Juries don't really like that.
Hey, what's he doing?
But you claim you're innocent.
And this mysterious kidnapper?
The guy who supposedly kept you
in the basement the whole time?
                What about him?
- He was gone.
- And how would you respond to
  those who say you made him up?
Well, it doesn't really matter
much now, does it?
                Amy Maxwell?
Coma, three months.
Time's up.
    I have a few more questions.
Time's up.
<i>He was still out there.</i>
<i>And no one knew him</i>
<i>better than me.</i>
<i>How he operates,</i>
<i>what he's capable of.</i>
<i>I wasn't done,</i>
<i>not by a long shot.</i>
<i>One day, I'll be free.</i>
<i>And then I'm gonna do to him</i>
<i>what he did to me.</i>
<i>And then it all changed.</i>
<i>Amy was awake.</i>
<i>And talking.</i>
<i>The evidence against me</i>
<i>took on a new light,</i>
<i>and it didn't hold up.</i>
<i>Now getting free</i>
<i>was just the beginning.</i>
<i>I thought back</i>
<i>to all that I learned</i>
<i>that first night of poker.</i>
<i>Then, they were just stories,</i>
<i>but now they were my guides.</i>
<i>A map that would lead me</i>
<i>to the end of my journey,</i>
<i>to him.</i>
<i>I was using my brain</i>
<i>and following my heart.</i>
<i>Lots of false leads</i>
<i>and wrong turns,</i>
<i>but I knew I was getting closer,</i>
<i>patiently moving forward.</i>
<i>I knew this guy</i>
<i>better than anyone else.</i>
<i>I knew how he thought,</i>
<i>what he was looking for.</i>
<i>I knew his reasons.</i>
<i>And that meant</i>
<i>I could catch him.</i>
And I heard this little girl
screaming. So I went over
to see what was happening.
- How does that look?
- Oh, yeah, that was def--
            So-- So, that's it.
            He got him?
            He's a cop.
            That's what he does.
        One shot,
        right through the heart.
        And I say, rot in peace.
We lost two of our best
to that bastard.
There's only one choice there.
            That's your captain.
    Pride of the department.
    He got two fucking parades
    for that.
    Got more balls
    than he does brains, man.
Hey, that's my kind of cop.
Who's your kind of cop?
- Hey!
-             Not you.
        Finally. Come on,
        you're late. Sit down.
- What, you don't wear a watch?
- There it is.
Come on, come on, come on.
    Let's get the game on.
Go. Salud.
    They always like this,
    Captain?
Always. I told you
it was gonna be like this.
        Don't listen to a word
        he tells you.
This guy was crapping his pants
worse than you his first night.
        Couldn't play cards.
        Couldn't tell stories.
        Same then as he is now.
        Uno, baby.
Stop jawing. Start dealing.
Let's play some fucking cards.
    You done bitching?
    All right. Here we go.
    Five card stud, no wilds.
<i>Wisdom and hindsight.</i>
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>that was the purpose</i>
<i>of poker night.</i>
<i>To teach the next guy</i>
<i>a lesson from your mistakes.</i>
<i>We deal with three percent</i>
<i>of the population...</i>
<i>97% of the time.</i>
<i>And they all think</i>
<i>they're smarter than you.</i>
<i>They're not.</i>
<i>Except for the ones</i>
<i>who actually are.</i>
<i>We never catch those bastards.</i>
<i>We just pretend</i>
<i>they don't exist.</i>
<i>There are some lessons...</i>
<i>you just have to</i>
<i>learn on your own.</i>
