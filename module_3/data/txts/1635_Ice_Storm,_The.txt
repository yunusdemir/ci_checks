[ Hydraulic Brakes Release,

Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen ! This train,
originating from New York's Grand
Central Station, is back in service !
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.
New Canaan, Connecticut,
next stop.
[ Boy Narrating ] ln issue
number 141 of the Fantastic Four,
published in November, 1973,
Reed Richards has to use
his antimatter weapon...
on his own son who Annihilus
has turned into a human atom bomb.
It was a typical predicament
for the Fantastic Four...
because they weren't
like other superheroes;
they were more like a family.
And the more power they had, the more
harm they could do to each other...
without even knowing it.
That was the meaning
of the Fantastic Four:
that a family is like
your own personal antimatter.
Your family is the void
you emerge from and the place
you return to when you die.
And that's the paradox:
the closer you're drawn back in,
the deeper into the void you go.
[ Man ] The dilemma Dostoyevsky
claims here to have discovered...
goes to the very core of Christianity's
relationship to the modern world.
But it is a dilemma that--
Yes, Libbets.
But Dostoyevsky is saying
here is that...
to be a Christian is to choose, because
you have to choose of your own choice.
And since you can't choose
to be good...
because that'd be too rational,
you have to choose to be bad.
- It's existential.
- Thank you, Libbets. That's
a very compelling summary.
But, of course,
existentialism, per se--
Libbets ? Hey,
Dostoyevsky--
I'm also really a fan.
And, uh, what you were
saying, you know--
- Have you ever read The ldiot ?
- The ldiot ?
If you liked Notes From Underground,
you'll love The ldiot.
Great.
Thanks for the tip.
The ldiot !
[ Boy ]
I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
Oh, come on. She's a poor little rich
girl. Check out the jeans and fur look.
And get a load of this: like, her mom
and stepdad and stepsisters...
are going to Switzerland
to ski over Thanksgiving break
and they didn't invite her.
- How do you know this shit ?
- They did it last year too.
It's traditional or something.
They've got this humongoid place
in New York and she just holes
up there with a wad of cash.
You think Francis is going
to beat me to the punch here ?
Since he sleeps with every girl
you ever show an interest in,
why don't you just keep your
Libbets fixation a secret from him ?
You already told him.
[ Scoffs ]
[ Bluesy Rock ]
I hope you changed the water
in that bong from last night.
The water, as you call it, is a special
mixture of amaretto and brandy...
blended for just the exact
chemical interaction...
with the last
of our precious Thai stick.
Give me your dirty love
[ Continues ]
- [ Coughs ]
- Oh-whoa-whoa ! Waste not,
Master Hood. That was 20 for the bag.
[ Continues Coughing ]
Oh.
I've been thinkin', Francis.
You know, you are
one drug-addled elitist freak.
And when the revolution comes I do not
want to be lined up with you and shot...
because you are fuckin' ripe
for political reeducation--
- you know, like in the fields.
- Let me enlighten you
about something here.
You and I exist on two opposite sides
of a great existential divide,
that being your pathetic
virginity on the one hand...
and my astonishing number
of sexual conquests on the other.
- You're simply jealous.
- [ Knocking ] Hood, telephone.
And remember: With your erogenous
zones lubricated with the mighty herb,
beware out there because you drone on
like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Flame on, asshole.
- Hello ?
- Paul ?
- Oh, hi, Dad.
- Hey, guy.
- How's it goin' ?
Everything all right up there ?
- Yeah, everything's good.
Well, good. I'm just confirming you'll
be on the 4:40 on Wednesday, right ?
I'm gonna come Thursday.
Well, you can't come on Thursday, Paul,
because Thursday's already Thanksgiving.
[ Nixon On Television ] ...but a record
which would only be disclosed--
- [ Continues, lndistinct ]
- Well, that's the whole point
of the holidays, Paul,
so you and your sister can mope around
the house and your mother and I can...
wait on you hand and foot while
the two of you occasionally
grunt for more food...
from behind the hair
in your faces.
-Believe it or not we actually enjoy it.
-Okay, okay, Dad.
Good. Thanks, guy.
Hang on a second.
Wendy, you want to say
"Hi" to your brother ?
Wendy, come on !
[ Nixon, Continuing ]
...we should get the facts out first.
- Charles.
- Charles.
Have you been
keeping out of my shit ?
Have you refrained from entering
the sacred precincts of my room ?
I haven't touched
your sh-- stuff.
- Are you watching this ?
- Watching what ?
Nixon, doofus. It's incredible.
He should be shot.
Hey, drop the political
assassination stuff, please.
He's a liar. Dean told him
on March 21 about Kalmback and Hunt,
all about the payoffs
to the Watergate burglars,
so you tell me where
the so-called "Dean Report" is.
- But you can't,
because it doesn't exist.
- All right. The defence rests.
[ Wendy Continues,
lndistinct ]
- You want another ?
- No, thank you.
- We should be off.
- Gotcha.
- ...knows that when the March 24 tape--
- Charles ?
Charles, calm down.
I wasn't in on it.
It's gonna sink, and the entire
country will fall into anarchy,
- and the Symbionese Liberation Army--
- Dinner's on the counter.
We'll be at the Carvers'.
You know the number.
- Paul, hi.
- Hi.
Hi. Is there anything special
you want, any particular kind
of food we can stock up on ?
- Nope.
- No ? You're all right ?
- Yeah, I'm-l'm good.
- Yeah ? Okay, all right,
we'll see ya next week.
- I love you.
- Um, me too.
All right. Bye-bye.
All right, Wendy. We'll see you later.
Asleep by 10:00.
I mean it, young lady.
As a matter of fact, I have a practice,
whenever I'm not too tired at night,
of dictating my own recollections
of the day.
I think that, perhaps, will be the more
accurate record of history in the end.
[ Chattering ]
The dog jumps up
and barks--
It was a benefit
for the ACLU or something.
Harry Reems himself was there.
- The man with the--
fr-from Deep Throat ?
- The very one.
- Classic.
- Something about a First
Amendment defence fund.
- Ted took me to see it.
- Oh, Ted. How romantic.
- Hmm.
You know, I have to admit
the movie didn't do much for me.
But being in that theatre,
surrounded by all those horny young
college boys and perverts,
I mean, there was something
in the air that--
- Oh ! I'm sorry !
- Jeez !
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. No problemo, Mikey.
It's okay, Mikey. No problem.
Put the wine down.
Just leave the wine on the table.
Go on into the kitchen.
- It's fine. It's fine.
- Sandy, help your brother out.
It's nothing.
It's fine. Thanks.
- We changed our couples group.
- Now we're in some geriatric group,
though I must admit
there are a couple of lookers.
But you two are still
sticking it out with Dr Pasmier ?
Oh, actually, Ben decided that--
Well, I mean we both decided--
I just don't see
what the appeal is.
I mean, like Ted said,
people go in there and just
get themselves all worked up--
And that's the point.
Then go home and make up.
But Elena and l, we don't, uh,
go in for those sort of histrionics.
About the only big fight we've
had in years was about whether
to go back into couples therapy.
It appears you won.
[ Laughter ]
[ Soft Jazz ]
[ Chattering ]
- Oh, please don't.
- It's no bother.
I insist.
Don't touch them.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ]
It's really
quite all right.
Of course.
[ Laughter ]
- [ Woman ] And to think they met
at a key party of all things.
- A key party ?
Oh, you know. It's a California thing.
That scuzzy husband of hers...
dragged her kicking and screaming
to one when they were out in L.A.
You know, the men put
their car keys in a bowl,
and at the end of the evening the women
line up and fish them out...
and whoever's they've got
they go home with.
Anyhow, that's how she met this
Rod person or whatever his name is.
He's left his wife, she's packing
for California and lrwin is devastated.
- It's so ironic.
- Ironic ?
[ Chuckling ]
Well, yes, ironic.
His name's Rod.
[ Chuckles ]
No, come on. He's like a big,
infected whitehead. I would never--
- [ Door Closes ]
- Shit. It's my parents.
[ Chuckles ]
He's so gross.
My drumstick was still frozen
when you, you know, cut inside there.
[ Sighs ] Probably gonna get--
whatever that disease--
- I knew it. Watch this.
- [ Chuckles ]
- Dad, stop it !
- Get to sleep, young lady. I mean it !
- Fascist.
- If I were a fascist...
I would have sent you to one
of those southern military
academies a long time ago.
Now, get to bed !
Hey !
Hey, kiddo.
- Sleep well, huh ?
- Good night, Dad.
[ Sighs ]
Ben.
[ Sighs ]
[ Brakes Screech ]
...reduce its cash position, especially
during this period of inflation.
[ Continues, lndistinct ]
Elena ? Elena Hood,
am I right ?
- Yes.
- Reverend Edwards.
Philip Edwards. You came by...
- and checked out the congregation
a couple of times last year.
- Oh, yes.
It was, um--
Oh, I ended up--
Oh, no need to make excuses.
We're not for everyone, I know.
But, um, I did think for a time
that you might be someone who--
Well, what I mean is that you
didn't seem to think what we
were trying to do is laughable,
Iike some of your fellow
citizens around hereabouts.
No, no. I didn't think
it laughable at all.
Perhaps you find in books
what I try to find in people.
[ Chuckles ]
That sounds vaguely like an insult.
Oh... my, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way at all.
Perhaps I meant it simply
as a, a provocation.
[ Scoffs ]
She's a total Young Republican.
She said you licked Dave Brewster's
weenie in the 3rd floor bathroom.
She's lying. I wouldn't touch
Dave Brewster's dick if you paid me.
It's probably crawling with V.D.
from when he stuck it in her,
- [ Scoffs ]
- which he did.
Donna said that her brother and all his
stupid friends were talking about--
[ Boys Shouting ]
Mikey !
Stoner !
I suppose my reluctance was...
the group aspect of it; I've
never been much of a joiner,
although I still consider myself
a somewhat religious person.
Well, l, of course, flatter myself
that our church is not exactly...
what most people would call
organized religion.
At times, it's
the disorganization that's liberating.
And, of course, I've begun to minister
much more in what one might call...
therapeutic environments-- in small
groups and couples and, uh, one-on-one.
My daughter.
I haven't been on a bike
for years.
[ Both Chuckle ]
When was the last time
you rode a bike ?
They say you never forget.
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hey, Sandy.
- Mikey was looking for you.
- Oh, yeah ?
See ya.
[ Imitates Gunshot ]
Want some gum ?
- Devil Dog ?
- Chewing.
- Did you tell Sandy ?
- Tell Sandy what ?
You didn't tell him
either, did you ?
[ Both Moan ]
[ Both Sigh ]
We were golfing. And golfing, to me,
is something I'm supposed to enjoy--
and I was on the goddam
golf team in college,
so it's something one would assume
I do well-- I used to do well.
But basically, these days, golfing
for me is like hoeing or plowing.
- It's like farming. And George Clair...
- [ Chuckles ]
has obviously-- in the mere
two years he's been with the firm--
he's obviously been taking
secret lessons with a golf pro.
I bet the entirety of his
disposable income has been dedicated...
to humiliating me
on the golf course.
And that guy talks nonstop
throughout the entirety
of the miserable 18 holes...
- Ben.
- on topics that are the supposed
domain of my department.
- Ben.
- Yeah ?
You're boring me.
I have a husband. I don't particularly
feel the need for another.
You have a point there.
That's a very good point.
We're having an affair. Right.
An explicitly sexual relationship.
Your needs, my needs.
You're absolutely right.
- You better get dressed.
The boys'll be home soon.
- Gotcha.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Wendy.
It's funny. When I was in town
I saw you on your bike.
- With Mikey ?
- Who ?
- Nobody.
- Mikey Carver ?
Oh, we were just
riding around.
Well, you looked
very free when I saw you,
as if I were seeing my own
memories of being a girl. [ Chuckles ]
There was something
internal about it.
Mom, are you okay ?
[ Scoffs ]
Of course, Wendy. I'm sorry.
- You must think I'm ripe to be
checked into Silver Meadows.
- You're not a psycho.
- People at Silver Meadows
aren't psychos.
- I know.
They're rich drug addicts
and celebrities.
They need the money at school
for my band uniform.
I thought you quit the band.
I never hear you practise any more.
Yeah, well, I don't
really need to practise.
I just play a few notes, anyway,
so I figured I'd just stay in.
Well, I'm sure your father
and I would love to hear
what you're playing these days.
Maybe after dinner ?
[ Plays ]
The Halfords have
invited us again this year.
[ Dropping lce ln Glass ]
Do you want to go ?
- Mmm. What do you think ?
- Well, it's a neighbourhood tradition.
- [ Sighs ] I'm, uh, gonna go to bed.
- So early ?
Mmm. Rough day.
Good night.
Is that a new aftershave ?
Uh, yeah. Uh, musk or something.
You like it ?
Mmm.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Hey, Mikey ?
- Yeah ?
- Geometry ?
- [ Scoffs ] Sure.
Anything but this English.
How come you're so good
at math but not at English ?
I'm not good at math,
I'm just good at geometry.
It's like, you know
when they say "two squared,"
you think it means
two times two equals four,
but they really mean a square--
it's really space.
It's not numbers, it's space,
and it's perfect space,
but only in your head 'cause
you can't draw a perfect square
in the material world,
but in your mind
you can have perfect space.
You know ?
Yeah. But I just need
some help with my homework.
- Hey, guys. I'm back.
- You were gone ?
[ Laughs ]
Yeah, Mikey. Yup.
I was in Houston working on some
great new ideas about silicon.
It comes from sand.
It's a semiconductor. So,
how you guys doin' ? How's school ?
Um, I don't know.
Okay, I guess.
Mmm.
All right.
[ Sighs ]
- [ Sighs ]
- Good trip ?
You bet.
- Jim. Jesus.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
- Hell, we gotta trade this thing
in for a normal bed.
- Just be careful.
Have you noticed anything
with Mikey lately ?
The kid seemed a little
out of it tonight, huh ?
[ Scoffs ]
Tonight ?
Mikey's been out of it
since he was born.
[ Sighs ]
Guess the kid takes after me, huh ?
[ Laughs ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Chiming Quietly ]
"Molecules.
Because of molecules we are connected
to the outside world from our bodies.
Like when you smell things.
Because when you smell a smell
it's not really a smell,
it's part of the object that has
come off of it-- molecules.
So when you smell something bad it's
like, in a way, you're eating it.
This is why you should not
really smell things...
in the same way you don't eat
everything in the world around you...
because, as a smell,
it gets inside of you.
So, the next time you go
into the bathroom after
someone else has been there,
remember what kind of molecules
you are, in fact, eating."
[ Playing ]
[ Fades ]
Mrs Hood ? Mrs Hood,
did you forget something ?
- No.
- Uh, wh-why don't you
just come on in here.
I think maybe
you forgot something.
[ Paul Narrating ] To find
yourself in the Negative Zone,
as the Fantastic Four often do,
means that all everyday
assumptions are inverted.
Even the lnvisible Girl
herself becomes visible...
and so she loses
the last semblance of her power.
It seems to me that everyone exists
partially on a Negative Zone level--
some people more than others.
In your life it's kind of
like you dip in and out of it:
the place where things don't quite
work out the way they should.
But for some people,
there's something about the
Negative Zone that tempts them,
and they end up going in--
going in all the way.
[ Bang ]
[ Loud Bang ]
Sandy !
You idiotic little dope !
You could blow yourself fucking
sky-high with this demented crap !
Hey.
[ Whispering ]
Hey.
I'll take this.
[ Sighs ]
You're not gonna tell
Dad, are you ?
Would it matter ?
What's this ?
You know, it's the whip--
the one Uncle Frank
got me from Mexico.
It's not packed
with explosives, is it ?
No.
Play with the whip.
- You turned them all down, didn't you ?
- Well, I didn't love them.
Isn't it a fact that you turned
them down because these men wanted--
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi, Mrs Carver.
Mikey, have you heard the explosions
coming from the back yard ?
- [ Television Continues, lndistinct ]
- I don't know.
Do you know what
your brother's been up to ?
I don't know.
- ...a secret intention
not to want children ?
- [ Sighs ]
- [ Woman On Television ]
That's not true !
- Didn't you--
No, sir. I want children
very much and so does Bill.
[ Television Continues,
lndistinct ]
Then, when that happened, you went to
another doctor and got a prescription.
- No, that is not true.
- Excuse me.
Don't you kids have homework ?
[ Together ]
Thanksgiving break.
If you deny that, we have a witness
in the courtroom, another druggist.
- Take a look. You're under oath.
- All right, I did. Is it a crime ?
No wonder the police can't find out
how the gang is transporting the stuff.
They're using milk trucks.
[ TV ]
They're leaving. Return the scanner
and follow the truck.
- Oh. After you.
- No, you can--
Hey, Sandy, what were you blowing up out
there ? Your mom seemed pretty P.O.'d.
- All my model planes.
- The ones you built ?
Yeah. They were getting old.
[ Laughs ]
They couldn't fly anyhow.
I'm gonna get a radio-controlled
aeroplane for Christmas.
I'm gonna stuff it full of M-80s
and fly it into Mrs Burgess'
class and blow it up.
Well, I have to go
to the bathroom.
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.
[ Breathing Hard ]
[ Shouting ]
What do you want ? What do you want ?
Get out of here !
Get out !
[ TV Continues ]
[ Janey ]
What's going on here ?
Wendy, a person's body
is his temple.
- [ Panting ]
- This body is your first
and last possession.
Now, as your own parents
have probably told you,
in adolescence our bodies
tend to betray us.
That's why in Samoa and
other developing nations...
adolescents are sent out
into the woods, unarmed,
and they don't come back
till they've learned a thing or two.
Do you understand ?
I don't ever
want to see you.
Then why'd you come
after me ?
[ Ben ]
Elena, can you give me a hand here ?
- Oh !
- I'm trying to get this turkey
defrosted before tomorrow.
- Whoop ! There.
- [ Laughs ] Got it ?
Can you take this ?
Oop !
Here.
You all right there ?
Oh, sure. I'm--
[ Sniffling ] Um, did you remember
to pick up the cranberry sauce ?
Uh, yes. Yes.
Because, uh, you like it
on your turkey sandwiches.
I do.
I'm--
Are-Are you--
I-l don't know.
I think l, uh--
- Elenie, you know--
- Ben--
- I've been thinking--
- Ben, maybe no talking right now.
If you start talking
you're going to--
- I'm going to pick up Paul
at the station. Want to come ?
- No.
- What you been up to ?
- Nothing.
[ Shower Running ]
So how's school
treating you ?
It's good.
- Classes ?
- Fine.
- Grades ?
- All right.
- Anyone special ? You know--
- Huh-uh.
Well, it's good to see ya.
We miss you around the house and all.
But this, uh, this St. Peters--
it's top of the line, eh ?
Oh, yeah.
You know, Paul, I was thinking
this may be as good a time as any...
to have a little talk...
about, um--
- Well, uh--
- About ?
- [ Horn Honks, Tyres Screech ]
Well,
the whole gamut, uh,
facts of life.
'Cause I tell ya there's
things happening that you're
probably old enough to digest.
Things.
Well, things that happen
between a--
Well, um,
on the self-abuse front--
and this is important, uh--
I don't think it's advisable
to do it in the shower.
It wastes water and electricity
and because we expect you to be
doing it there in any case.
And not on, uh,
onto the linen.
Oh, anyway, if you're worried
about anything at all...
just feel free to ask,
and, uh, we'll look it up.
Dad, you know I'm 16.
[ Chuckles ] All the more reason to be
having this little heart-to-heart.
- Uh,
- [ Elena ] Hi !
Paul, uh,
I was wondering,
could you do me a favour
and pretend I never said any of that ?
- Sure, Dad.
- Thanks.
- Hi ! How are you ?
- Hello.
Movin' ahead
so life won't pass me by
[ Continues ]
- Hello, Charles.
- Greetings, Charles.
How are the parental units
functioning these days ?
Dad's doing his "Up with People"
routine; Mom really hasn't
been saying much.
I don't know. Dad seems
a little weird. You know, nervous ?
[ Chuckles ] Yeah, well,
wait till Mom finally opens her mouth.
And I'm gonna go there free
Do you think they're headed for,
like, the dustbin of history:
divorce court ?
Well, they dropped out of their
couples group therapy thing.
Is that good or bad ?
They can change their minds
but they can't change me
May I operate
the telephonic apparatus ?
Why don't you use
the one downstairs ?
Well, I'm calling an individual,
Charles, in New York,
confirming a social outing
for Friday night.
Can I come ?
Well, it's a one-on-one
kind of date thing.
- With who ?
- Her name's Libbets.
"Libbets" ? What kind
of a name is "Libbets" ?
- [ Record Skips ]
- Is that my record ?
- No.
- You have messed with my shit, Charles.
[ Continues Skipping ]
[ Sighs ]
Well, it's great
that we can all be together.
And this Thanksgiving, no, uh,
yelling, no hysteria, especially
with your grandpa not here--
although we miss him.
So let's do it right.
Wendy, why don't you say grace ?
You used to love
to say grace, remember ?
Dear Lord, thank You for
this Thanksgiving holiday...
and for all the material
possessions we have and enjoy...
- and for letting us white people
kill the lndians and steal...
- Wendy.
- their tribal lands and stuff
ourselves like pigs...
- Okay. Okay.
- even though children in Asia
are being napalmed--
- Jesus ! Enough ! All right !
- Paul, roll ?
- Thank you.
- Can I have the gravy ?
- Uh-huh.
[ Liquid Pouring
lnto Glass ]
Thanks.
You having one ?
In a bit.
[ Sighs ] You know,
I think Elena might suspect something.
[ Sighs ] Maybe it's all
for the better, you know ?
Yesterday at dinner, she--
Well, she didn't say anything.
Has she acted funny to you ?
I mean, have you...
- noticed anything ?
- Have I noticed anything ?
- Mmm.
- I'm not married to her,
Benjamin; you are.
I think you've probably a better
vantage point from which to observe her.
Yeah, but, uh, I've been
working a lot lately, and--
No, that's not it.
I guess maybe we're just on
the verge of saying something--
saying something
to each other.
On the verge.
I'll be back.
- Hmm ?
- Birth control.
Right. Gotcha.

No one's here.
We can just watch TV.
Maybe we can
mess around, you know ?
Only if you want to.
I don't know.
Why did you--
with Sandy ?
I don't know.
Do you like him ?
He worships you.
What's that ?
- Oh, wow !
- Wendy.
I won't take my pants off. I'll touch
it, but that's as far as it goes.

- What ?

When Worlds Collide.
What the hell are you kids doing
down here ?
- What do you think we're doing, Dad ?
- What do I think ?
I think you're probably
touching each other.
I think you're touching that
reckless jerk-off, for God's sake,
and I think he's trying
to get into your slacks.
I think at 14 years of age you're
getting ready to give up your girlhood !
- Hey, hang on there, Mr Hood.
- Don't you direct
a single word at me, Mikey.
I don't want to hear it.
I'll be discussing this matter
with your parents very soon.
- Young lady--
- Talking to me, Dad ?
Who else would I be talking to ?
And take that thing off !
Then forget
all the stern dad stuff.
I'm not interested in your
smart remarks right now, young lady.
Let's go, right now ! You and I
can discuss it on the walk home.
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.
I really don't care that much.
I'm just not sure
he's right for you is all.
- Huh ?
- [ Sighs ]
It's just, you develop
a sense, when you're older,
if things are gonna
work out or if they won't.
And sometimes
it's not worth the mess.
Your toes cold ?
Come on.
I'll carry you.
Hey, should I dress for the Halfords
now, or, uh-- Give me your--
It's up to you. I'd like to go early
and leave pretty soon after that.
I get you, loud and clear.
Hey, you look nice.
Thanks. So, where've
you two been ?
[ Chuckles ]
You'll never guess where I found her.
You found her ?
In the basement at Janey and Jim's
with that weirdo, Mikey.
Not even a TV on.
They're on the floor,
and he's got his trousers undone--
though, thank goodness,
she was still dressed.
Well, I really let him have it,
and Wendy came home peacefully.
So, uh, what were you doing
in the Carvers' basement, anyway ?
I was just dropping off a coffee cup;
Jim left it last time he was over.
It was on the dash of the car.
You were, you know, reading.
I just wanted to catch some air.
Oh, yeah, right, right. The mustache
coffee cup, the one sitting on the dash.
- Yeah, that one.
- That one.
- See ya.
- Stay out of trouble.
- You'll be on the 10:30 train ?
- 11:30.
- Paul--
- Oh, let the guy have some fun.
What's the name of this girl
with the fancy New York address ?
Libbets.
Libbets Casey.
"Libbets" ? What sort
of name is "Libbets" ?
Just get a taxi home from the station
tonight. It's supposed to storm.
Okay. Bye.
Bye.
[ Sighs ]
[ Newscaster ]
...in its inquiry on Thursday.
- And that ends tonight's coverage
of the Watergate affair.
- Oh, shoot.
- In other news, outside--
- ...a few snow showers which
quickly turn to light rain.
Unless that rain comes down
even harder tonight, accompanied
by decreasing temperatures...
getting down
to around freezing by midnight.
Drivers in particular, beware-- it's
gonna get awfully icy on those roads.
- We have a severe weather warning--
- What's for dessert ?
- See for yourself.
- No advice from the experts, eh ?
...flood warnings in parts of southern
Connecticut and the Jersey shore.
- Let's go to our weather map
now for the grim details.
- [ Dishes Clattering ]
A line of showers now located
across central New Jersey is
sweeping our way...
and is expected to arrive
in our area within the hour.
- [ Sighs ] Look, um--
- Don't start.
- Do you-Do you-Do you think l--
- I have no idea.
Well, what's on your mind ?
I mean, you--
It wouldn't make for a pleasant evening,
if that's what you're after.
I don't want to talk about it.
Stupid mustache cup.
- What do you mean ?
- Don't be dim.
I know you think I'm so dense.
You think I'm so dense...
that now you want to be seen with your
dense wife at the cocktail party.
And you want me to shake hands with
your friends and make conversation...
and you're not going to accord me the
respect of talking honestly about this.
You don't really know
what this feels like.
I didn't--
technically--
it's not what you're thinking, Elena.
Please have the decency to at least
not tell me what I'm thinking.
Oh, Ben ! Elena !
Wonderful.
- [ Kisses ] Wonderful. Come in.
- Great to see ya.
- Ooh, I just got lipstick--
- That's all right.
Good to see you too.
Would you care to play ?
New this year.
It's strictly volunteer,
of course.
You can put your coats
in the library if you like.
Oh, damn.
I've left the, uh--
- Oh, you've--
- In the car.
- Oh. Right.
- Yeah.
We'll, um, we'll
be right back.
Okay.
Oh, Rob.
The, uh, stuffed tomatoes.
[ Sighs ]
This just isn't
the best moment for this.
- I know. I know.
- [ Sighs ]
I had no idea--
- That this was going
to be a key party ?
- Yeah.
Well, if we'd understood, uh, we
could've invented some sort of excuse.
[ Sighs ]
A key party.
Did you see how stuffed
that bowl was already ?
Well ?
I think we're here,
and we don't have to stay.
We, uh, ought simply to put in an
appearance, and then we can head home.
You have some marker,
that's what I think.
If you wanna know the truth,
you have some marker.
And you're gonna put it on the house
keys so that Janey can find it.
And then when I get back to the house,
I'm gonna find the two of you in there,
and Wendy will be able to hear you, and
Paul will be back and he'll hear you.
- And I'll catch you.
That's what I think.
- Elena.
It's not what you think.
It's not some big plot.
Honestly, l-l--
I don't feel good about it.
I just--
I don't know.
Well, I'm really pleased
to hear a confession.
Elena, you're just getting
wound up to get wound up.
Listen, let's just go
to this fiasco.
If that's what you want.
Let's just go on in.
I'd rather talk
to anyone else but you.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
My dear, he wrote her out of the will,
and now her attorneys are, um--
- and this has been goin' on
for years-- her attorneys--
- [ Elena ] Oh, Dot.
-  [ Soft Rock ]
- [ Indistinct Chatter ]
- Ben, how you doin' ? You're soaked.
- Hey, Jack.
- Hell of a night out there.
You know my wife Ronnie.
- Well--
- Yeah, nice to see you.
I'm just gonna go--
- Hey, Benji.
- Hey, Mark. How you doin' ?
- Good to see you.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Excuse me.
Hey, Maude, how are you ?
Pierce, how you doin' ?
- Did I see Elena ?
- Uh, she's here, yeah.
Just gonna get a drink.
- Excuse me.
- Benji.
Clair. George Clair. What the hell
brings you to New Canaan ?
Well, it's
the funniest thing.
I've been talking
to some investors--
a little, uh, outside venture
you understand, between you and me--
about a scheme to manufacture
a new styrofoam packaging.
These little, um, uh,
these peanut-like pieces...
that keep an item free
from trauma during shipping.
It's miraculous.
Anyway, it turns out...
that the genius behind the whole project
is your neighbour, Jim Carver.
How about that ?
Well, isn't that
a one-in-a-million coincidence.
A real dreamer,
our Jim Carver, eh ?
You're right. Listen, I'm gonna make
a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy.
Right. See you, uh,
bright and early Monday a.m.
Say, uh,
where's the wife ?
Uh, in Rhode lsland with her folks.
I'm a free agent tonight.
[ Indistinct ]
Oh, jeez, Benji.
Well, here you are.
Damn right.
Where the hell were you ?
What are you
talking about ?
Don't bullshit me
around, Janey.
Jesus Christ !
I waited around for more
than half an hour in nothing
but my boxer shorts and--
- Ben, Janey.
- Oh, hi, Dorothy, Ted.
What's all that about ?
I mean, what the hell happened ?
A prior engagement
overcame me.
- What ?
- Listen, Benjamin Hood,
I have obligations that proceed your--
from before you showed up.
I mean, one or two good-natured
encounters-- that doesn't mean I'm--
I'm not just
some toy for you.
When I remembered some chores I wanted
to get done before the party...
I just did them, that's all,
because I wanted to get them
done before I saw Jimmy.
Jimmy ?
Jimmy ?
I'm not sure how to take this.
What do you mean, Jimmy ?
I thought you and your husband--
How you take it isn't all
that interesting to me, Benjamin.
[ Whispering ]
I'm sorry.
I just can't believe
you could be so--
[ Sighs ]
[ Woman Laughing ]
[ Man On P.A. ] Now approaching
our final stop, Grand Central Station.
Grand Central Station.
Excellent.
We were waiting.
We ?
You ought to read this, Hood.
Nixon, our leader.
All ye need know about
the travails of life.
- Check out the Checkers speech stuff.
- Francis.
You're gonna leave the seeds in there ?
ln the binding like that ?
- All will be revealed, baby.
- [ Man On TV, lndistinct ]
Don't be deceived, Dan.
When this falls to the ground,
it's turning immediately...
- to the hard,
slick and slippery stuff--
- Significant sleet and rain.
Major.
Hey there, you young knight,
can you, uh, check on the mead ?
Can you sally forth and
secure us some more mead ?
- Huh ?
- Moisture. Moisture. [ Chuckling ]
[ TV Continues, lndistinct ]
Fuck.
[ Indistinct Chattering ]
[ Chuckling ]
Frankie opens his with his teeth.
Hey, that's
a sellable skill.
[ Grunts ]
Hell on the fillings.
Oh, man.
Everything's gonna freeze,
you know ? Big freeze.
Yeah. Paul, are you
gonna get home okay ?
- Yeah.
- [ Lighter Clicks ]
[ Indistinct Chatter ]
Elena ?
Reverend Edwards.
Perhaps you might find it
in your heart to call me Philip.
- You're here. I'm a bit surprised.
- [ Laughs ]
Sometimes, the shepherd needs
the company of the sheep.
I'm going to try hard not to
understand the implications of that.
Forgive me.
I hope those weren't
my keys.
[ Water Running ]
[ Water Shuts Off ]
Eureka.
Valium, Seconal.
Paregoric ?
Francis Davenport IV, tonight
you sleep the sleep of the just.
[ Rock ]
And whence has yon
virginal maiden absconded ?
Into one of the other 20 or so
bathrooms they got in this place.
Check it out.
Not for the faint of heart.
Pharmaceutical !
You are a god.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
One for you... and one for me.
No candy for me ?
Groovy. Young master of the revels,
a treat for our hostess.
Um-- Well, uh,
I don't--
- What is it ?
- Come on, Paulie. Share the wealth.
- I mean, you copped 'em
from her mom's stash anyway.
- Let's see.
Libbets, you really shouldn't mix
and match. You know, with the beer.
I'm gonna put 'em back.
Oh, far out, Paulie. Hey, look,
these expired, like, five months ago.
Think they're better aged ?
- [ Laughing ]
- Maybe you should just have a half.
Thanks for the advice, Dad.
All right.
Benji.
Feelin' no pain.
The lndian saying goes,
"Pain is merely an opinion."
Hey, check it out.
Maria Conrad brought her son.
[ Indistinct Chattering ]
I wish some of the gang
had brought their daughters.
[ TV ]
Thank you, Brian.
[ Telephone Ringing ]
- Hood residence.
- Your parents at that party ?
Yeah. Yours ?
[ Sighs ]
You get in trouble ?
I don't know.
I can't really tell yet.
- Sorry if I got you into trouble.
- [ TV, lndistinct ]
I'm gonna check out the ice storm.
Wanna come ?
[ Wendy On Telephone ]
Maybe. I don't know.
[ Psychedelic Rock ]
Where are you going ?
- Out.
- It's freezing.
- Yeah.
- Then why are you going ?
When it freezes, I guess that means
the molecules are not moving.
So when you breathe, there's
nothing in the air, you know,
to breathe into your body.
The molecules have stopped.
It's clean.
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
[ Footsteps Departing ]
When you're asking yourself
this question, "What is 'is' ?" and--
Oh, wait. This is the-the-
the training where they don't
let you go to the bathroom.
[ Laughs ]
That was the hard part, but I did it.
-  [ Soft Rock ]
- The foot. The foot.
Toe clipper man.
[ Laughs ]
I guess he's just really exhausted
from, you know, tests and stuff.
Yeah.
You know, Libbets,
I really feel,
you know, like, a real
connection to you.
Yeah.
- You don't even know me really.
- Sure I do.
Like, your aura
that you give off ?
My what ?
It's, like, very positive.
And, um,
I feel a real...
special feeling for you.
I have a special feeling
for you too...
because l-l do--
Special.
- You do ?
- Yeah.
To me,
you're just like a--
I feel for you
like you're my ow-own--
You're just like a--
[ Together ]
Brother.
- Yeah, you're not alone with that line.
- I do.
You are.
Right.
That's cool. Um--
So, how about we take
a bath together ?
[ Laughing ]
You're funny.
- A bath.
- [ Laughs ]
Like brother and sister.
Oh, man.
I'm so wasted.
[ Indistinct ]
[ TV ]
Hello ?
Wendy ?
[ Sighs ]
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
What are you doing ?
I just thought
I'd stop by.
Mike's out. I think
he went to Silver Meadow...
to see if you were
hanging around there.
Yeah.
- Oh.
- Mm-mmm.
Okay, everyone, we have
a little business to attend to now.
So, everyone who'd like to stay,
please gather in the living room.
Knock-knock.
[ Dot ] All right,
everybody, I've got the bowl.
We're gonna start now,
so nobody go anywhere.
[ Woman ]
Oh, my-- Oh !
You ready to go ?
We're not going anywhere.
[ Female Guest ]
Mark ? Mark, where'd you go ?
[ Grunting ]
[ Wind Howling ]
Check this out. He's supposed
to say all sorts of stuff,
but he's kind of
malfunctioned.
[ Electronic Voice ] Mayday ! Mayday !
Get this message back to base !
Same thing,
again and again.
It's gonna get a lot
colder tonight, I predict.
Maybe even a blackout.
[ Electronic Voice ]
Mayday ! Mayday !
[ Sandy ]
Do you have candles in your house ?
I know where
the candles are.
And I know where every
emergency exit is on this floor.
This knot's called
a hangman's noose.
Let's hang him.
[ Wind Howling ]
He's dead.
If it wasn't raining, we could
take him outside and blow him up.
He wouldn't blow up.
He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Well, looks like someone
got to its private parts before us.
Communist Viet Cong.
He left it
in the jungle.
Can I get in your bed...
with you ?
[ Indistinct Chattering,
Laughing ]
Well ?
- What shall the order be ?
- [ Laughing ]
Alphabetical ?
ln order of appearance ?
- [ Clears Throat ] Golf handicap.
- [ Laughing ]
Lowest handicap
does the honors.
[ Male Guest ]
That'd be Benji.
Ladies, isn't this
really up to you ?
[ Maria ]
It's up to one of us.
Oh, hell,
I'll go first.
All right,
all right.
[ Pierce ]
That's it.
[ Cheering, Shouting ]
[ Male Guest ]
Go get her, killer.
- Good night.
- Good luck.
Okay,
here goes.
Okay, Pammy.
[ Cheering, Shouting
Continue ]
[ Creaking ]
Want a drink ?
- Vodka ?
- You never tasted the stuff ?
[ Wind Howling,
Rain Splattering ]
Try again.
[ Coughs ]
Feels warm.
[ Laughs ]
One more shot ?
Under the covers ?
- [ Wendy ] Get 'em off.
- [ Both Giggling ]
[ Giggling Continues ]
Have you ever had
a nocturnal emission ?
Huh ?
That's when you wake up and you
find this pool of sticky stuff,
Iike after
a sexy dream.
They haven't told you
about this stuff yet ?
On what planet are you living on ?
[ Giggles ]
I love you.
That's nice.
Are you drunk ?
I don't know.
How do I know ?
I don't know either.
You spin around
when you lie down, I think.
I don't think I'm spinning.
[ Grunting, Panting ]
- [ Thud ]
- Oh !
[ Door Opens, Closes ]
[ Keys Rattling ]
How did you guess ?
[ Laughing ]
- [ Male Guest ] Good night, George.
- Let's go.
Gentlemen,
good night.
- Good night, George.
- Ladies, good night.
[ Male Guest ]
Sleep well, George.
Oh, my own husband.
Isn't that against the rules ?
- Try again.
- No.
- No, no, that's--
- No, thanks.
- That's fine.
- Come on, honey. That was too easy.
[ Dot ]
Getting down to the wire.
Okay.
No, no, no.
[ Groans ]
- Whoa, whoa.
- Are you okay ?
[ Janey ]
He's okay.
He'll be okay.
Come on.
[ Mark ]
You okay ?
[ Exhales ]
Sorry.
Sorry. I, uh--
Maybe, uh, the bathroom ?
- Yeah, yeah. Up we go.
- [ Dot ] It's right down the hall.
[ Bell Ringing ]
Hold the train !
- [ Ringing Ends ]
- Hold it !
[ Pants, Laughs ]
Watch your step.
Well, I have to say I don't have
much faith in my car keys.
They're still
in that bowl.
It doesn't seem very safe
leaving your car keys laying around.
Let me.
Thanks, but--
Oh, I don't think so.
It's been kind of
a discouraging evening.
Well, you couldn't have hoped for
much better when you came up the walk.
Somehow, it seemed different in
my imagination when I thought about it.
Actually, I didn't
think about it at all really.
You want some coffee
or something ?
Elena,
the fact that we're neighbours--
[ Sighs ]
close friends--
well, it makes all of this
seem a little strange,
don't you think ?
[ Sighs ] My husband is probably
passed out in the bathroom,
or at least
he wishes he were.
I've been married to him for 17 years
and I have no intention...
of going in there
to get him.
So, what I'm proposing
is that...
since your wife went off with a boy
and since you are here alone,
I'm proposing that you and I
do what makes sense.
Stay warm, pass some time.
That's all.
Now don't make me feel
as if I'm being too forward.
- If you don't--
- What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Okay.
- Whoa !
- Oh, Jim ! Hold on to me.
[ Indistinct ]
Thanks.
- We're gonna have to defrost
this thing for a while.
- [ Engine Starts ]
Do these seats go back ?
[ Electronic Whirring ]
[ Grunting, Moaning ]
[ Horn Honks ]
[ Grunting, Panting ]
Oh !
[ Laughs ]
Oh, God !
That was awful.
Really awful.
I'm so sorry, Elena.
Um, look, can you
wait here a sec ?
I, uh,
I need to tidy up.
Uh, just a minute. I'll, uh,
I'll be right back. Will you wait ?
Of course.
[ Door Opens ]
[ Breathing Heavily ]
Elena.
[ Sighs ]
Ben, I've got
a ride home.
Maybe you should sleep this one off
on the couch here.
- I'll drive you.
- No. No, Ben, no.
You're in no condition
to drive.
We'll talk
in the morning, okay ?
You get some sleep
on the couch out there ?
I'll try.
We'll talk
in the morning.
We'll talk
in the morning.
[ Tyres Skidding ]
Shit !
- Oh, my God ! Stop.
- Easy does it. Easy.
You okay ?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.

Whoo !

[ Paul Narrating ]
When you think about it,
it's not easy to keep from
just wandering out of life.
It's like someone's always leaving
the door open to the next world,
and if you aren't paying attention
you could just walk through it,
and then you've died.
That's why in your dreams it's like
you're standing in that doorway...
and the dying people and
the newborn people pass by you...
and brush up against you as they come in
and out of the world during the night.
You get spun around,
and in the morning...
it takes a while to find
your way back into the world.
- [ Shivering ]
- Phone's out.
Hope the pipes--
[ Blowing Nose ]
Well, why don't you
put on some dry socks.
Uh, and there are some, uh, rain boots
in the guest closet back there.
- Last room downstairs.
- Thanks.
Get dressed.
[ Electrical Buzzing ]
Good morning, ladies
and gentlemen.
This train, originating
from New York's Grand Central Station,
is back in service.
Next stop will be
New Canaan, Connecticut.
New Canaan, Connecticut,
next stop.

up in Silver Lane.

I can't read
and I can't write down
I don't know
a book from countdown
I don't know
which shadow gets me
All I've got
is someone's face
Can I see a family smile
Can I reach tomorrow
Can I walk
a missing mile
Can I feel
Can I please
I can't reach it any more
I just sit back
and ignore
I just can't seem to get it right
Get it right
I can't reach it
I can't reach it
