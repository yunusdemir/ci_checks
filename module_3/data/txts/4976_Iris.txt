<i>Baek San gave Hyun Jun an order to
assassinate Yoon Sung Chul,</i>
<i>the prime minister of North Korea.</i>
<i>Though Hyun Jun succeeds, indifferent to
the dangers of possible failure,</i>
<i>he receives a huge injury in the process.</i>
<i>On Baek San's orders, even his best friend
Sa Woo is sent to kill him.</i>
<i>Chul Young and Seon Hwa
of the North Korean Intelligence</i>
<i>are in hot pursuit of Hyun Jun
to only return in failure.</i>
<i>Hyun Jun swears revenge on
Baek San, who abandoned him.</i>
<i>He was trying to make
his escape with Seung Hee,</i>
<i>when he came face to face with
Chul Young and Seon Hwa.</i>
<i>Hyun Jun, after seeing
the car Seung Hee was inside,</i>
<i>exploded in front of his eyes,
is in conflict.</i>
Episode 6
<i>Hyun Jun...</i>
<i>Sa Woo...</i>
<i>6 months later</i>
You.
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm a bit depressed.
What?
How dare she...
Let her be.
No, sir.
The discipline in the office today is...
<i>My children are like that as well.</i>
Nagging won't change anything.
It's easier for you to accept that
the world is changing.
<i>When weapons are modified by
private manufacturers,</i>
They first fix it down with a vise*
(*a mechanical screw device used for clamping
something to allow work to be performed on it)
And use a cutting tool
to make their modifications.
Right then, a peculiar feature is created.
Like fingerprints on a human.
This is an AKS-74U from Incheon.
This is a GSH-18 from Busan.
<i>These are, as I just described,</i>
<i>privately made goods.</i>
We believe that soon, a large amount of
illegal weapons will come into the country.
- Did you investigate into this?
- Yes.
I took ships' entry times and locations,
<i>and narrowed down the highest
probable ports of entry.</i>
Why are there so many?
Are you sure you narrowed it?
<i>We don't have time
to search all of those places.</i>
Since there are foreign ship routes that
go to the Russian embassy in the recently
<i>opened port of the Kapulya Sea,
this can turn into a diplomatic issue.</i>
Do you have any ideas?
If Kim Hyun Jun sunbae was here right now,
he would be able to sense which one...
Why?
I told you to erase
all memories of that man in this office.
Don't speak of it again.
<i>Yes, sir.</i>
<i>I've taken care of everything
you have instructed.</i>
The cries of exclusion will be
blamed on misgovernment.
It seems that you're quite
used to working for me.
A man that allows his conscious or
sense of responsibility,
<i>to hinder his ambition,
cannot attain anything.</i>
I wasn't wrong in choosing you.
<i>Don't you think so?</i>
Hey, how're you doin', girl.
<i>Wow, can I talk to you for a second?
You look good.</i>
<i>Can I talk to you please, baby?</i>
Come over, girl.
I'm talking to you, baby.
- Back off!
- Hey, what're you doing?
Hey, honey.
Want something else to drink?
There's something you might like.
I don't care! Back off!
Wow! Come on, baby!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm talking to you, bitch!
<i>It has been reported that
the official North-South phone,</i>
that was disconnected
is now connected again.
Even if it was disconnected,
the prospects are good that
communications can continue.
Things are good.
We can breathe easy now.
Then, is there anything else?
All the people in North Korea
that blamed us
<i>for Yoon Sung Chul's
assassination have disappeared.</i>
They must have settled things internally.
I believe that you no longer need to worry.
I am relieved to hear that the North-South
situation, in which we feared war,
<i>has a clear way towards a solution.</i>
You all did very well.
Please call the U.N. Security Council.
Yes, sir.
What do you think? The gardener
Jo Kyun Sup at the Blue House is very good,
don't you think?
He's incredibly good at knowing
how to cut with the tree's growth.
If it was not North Korea or South Korea,
who is responsible for
Yoon Sung Chul's assassination?
It is difficult for me to determine.
Hong Seung Ryong and Yoon Sung Chul
were pivotal in the development
of North Korea's Nuclear energy.
Now that they are both dead,
it remind of a similar
situation 30 years ago
when we were developing nuclear energy.
Even back then,
the nuclear scientists and the others
involved in the nuclear arms development
were all killed mysteriously.
I can't help but believe that
there is a powerful force out there,
that we do not know about.
How is Seung Hee?
She's cooling off with her contacts cut off.
I believe that she cannot
accept Hyun Jun's death.
I once raised a cat.
One day, it left my house and
returned with a huge wound.
He was hiding in a dark corner.
Wanting to quickly tend to his wounds,
I tried to pull it out of the corner.
But he scratched me.
That huge wound caused him to
distrust even his owner.
I'm sure in Seung Hee's current state,
she is like a cat that cannot trust anyone.
Time should fix that.
Couldn't that wound get worse?
She's not that weak.
Don't worry so much.
<i>Sa Woo...</i>
and you will be in danger.
I can't do that.
- I can't leave you here like this.
- Seung Hee.
If you die,
I'm going to die with you.
I can't return home by myself.
Yeah, it's me.
<i>I just sent it.</i>
It's the medical records
of Budapest hospitals.
But there is no place
that admitted Hyun Jun.
<i>If you weigh the possibilities,</i>
the chance of Hyun Jun's survival
is close to zero.
Why don't you think about giving up now?
<i>Seung Hee.</i>
<i>- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.</i>
Thanks for your work.
I'll hang up now.
<i>Oh yeah, I'm sending another file.</i>
It's a picture received
from the Hungary border.
<i>These are the two people who were in charge
during Yoon Sung Chul's assassination.</i>
<i>They're both North Korean Intelligence.</i>
<i>(The Revolutionary Mind of Baek Du)</i>
<i>Pyeongyang, North Korea</i>
Will you meet with her?
No.
<i>He's up! He's up!</i>
Isn't life something?
Even though it was not your fault
that Yoon Sung Chul died.
But there's no question that
we needed a sacrificial lamb.
Why are you being silent?
If anyone was to take
responsibility for the incident,
it would be me.
Stop acting noble and sit down.
In this room,
<i>nothing said will ever leave it.</i>
The electronic surveillance of the United
States or Japan cannot penetrate this room,
<i>even the regime has no access to this room.</i>
So no matter what you say in this room,
no matter who you curse,
<i>only you and I will know.</i>
It may not be good for your situation,
but Yoon Seung Chul's death
is not necessarily bad for me.
The nuclear development Yoon Sung Chul was
working on has now been passed onto me.
You should know well what this means to us.
<i>We're a nation on the verge
of starving to death.</i>
For a nation about to die from starvation,
it's the last shout of pride to the world.
<i>I'm planning on using the nuclear power
in my hand to its capabilities.</i>
The pride of our people has been cut down
and damaged as much as it could be.
I'm prepared to aim nuclear missiles
at wherever I need to.
<i>When it is difficult to choose
between yourself and this regime,</i>
sometimes you have to take a gamble.
<i>I believe that you believe the same as I do.</i>
This is why I am thinking of
reinstating you,
who has lost everything due to
this Yoon Sung Chul's situation.
What is it you want me to do?
No need to be rush.
<i>Let's slowly think things through.</i>
<i>I have one request.</i>
Speak.
The Intelligence's Kim Seon Hwa,
is there a way to...
If I reinstate you
and take her out of prison...
Wouldn't it seem strange?
<i>Let's think of creative situations.</i>
<i>I have been given news that you are awake.</i>
<i>I'm very relieved.</i>
<i>Because your reawakening means
that you still have a chance.</i>
Who are you?
<i>The person that saved your life.</i>
<i>I can understand your current situation.</i>
<i>Roosevelt said when he left the presidency,</i>
<i>"In politics, nothing happens by accident."</i>
<i>"If it happens,
you can bet it was planned that way."</i>
<i>You, Kim Hyun Jun, it was not chance
that you fell into this conspiracy.</i>
<i>You were selected by those
who would profit from this venture.</i>
Are you saying you know who selected me?
<i>I know that those who brought you
into this and gave your latest order,</i>
<i>are not the only players.</i>
<i>This conspiracy has been around longer
than you believe you know,</i>
<i>and will only continue.</i>
Who are you?
<i>Until I contact you again,
please focus on your health.</i>
<i>Because when the time comes,
there is something you must do.</i>
Seung Hee!
<i>Let's go eat first.</i>
Yes, after I finish this one.
Oh my...
<i>You finally know what you are doing.</i>
How long are you going to do this here?
<i>Personally, I like that you're here but,</i>
isn't it better that
you find your own place in life?
This is my place.
<i>What foolishness are you spouting?</i>
There are so many people that
need your skills and abilities,
<i>does it make sense that
you live here digging holes?</i>
You being here,
it's only till you get yourself together.
<i>When your pain heals and you forget
everything you should forget,</i>
you need to leave here.
Understand?
<i>Hurry and finish so that we can eat dinner.</i>
<i>Hurry!</i>
Yes.
<i>Do you enjoy your work?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>I think it suits me well.</i>
Suits you?
Nursery work suits the number one
profiler in South Korea.
How funny.
The office is crazy these days.
Soon,
the Deputy Secretary-General's position...
Sa Woo.
All that stuff no longer
has anything to do with me.
I don't really care,
and it's not much fun either.
What flower is this?
Iris.
In Korean, it's a "Brush flower."
It's pretty.
In Greek mythology, the river to the
underworld was called the Iris.
For me,
it's not a pretty flower but a sad flower.
Hyun Jun liked irises.
I'm sorry. If you were me...
Sit tight, don't move.
You are being given
an independent assignment.
<i>If you succeed,</i>
it will be instrumental in unifying
the North and South Korea.
<i>You, Kim Hyun Jun, it was not chance
that you fell into this conspiracy.</i>
<i>You were selected by those who
would profit from this venture.</i>
<i>I know that those who brought you
into this and gave your latest order,</i>
<i>are not the only players.</i>
<i>This conspiracy has been around longer
than you believe you know,</i>
<i>and will only continue.</i>
Come in.
This was sent from Budapest.
<i>This picture was taken at
the border of Hungary.</i>
<i>It's your final chance.</i>
He's in Japan.
Go catch him.
<i>Don't push yourself.</i>
If I had intentions like that,
I would've killed you earlier.
If you don't want to die,
then it's a good idea to drink it.
<i>Don't chase me anymore.</i>
<i>This is the one and
only instance of goodwill.</i>
Excuse me.
<i>Uhm...</i>
Please wake up.
Ahjussi?
<i>Ahjussi!</i>
<i>What happened? Ahjussi!</i>
<i>Please get up.
What happened? Are you all right?</i>
<i>From Budapest to Akita...
It must have been quite a journey.</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>
<i>Hachioji 3-way junction,</i>
<i>I had a hard time finding you.</i>
<i>You haven't forgotten my voice, have you?</i>
What's the reason you searched for me?
<i>As I said in Hungary,
there's something we have to do together.</i>
I'm not interested.
<i>Are you choosing revenge after all?</i>
<i>There's a saying that two graves
are needed for revenge:</i>
<i>one for your enemy</i>
<i>and one for yourself.</i>
Please don't look for me anymore.
I will hang up.
<i>Let me ask you one more time,</i>
<i>won't you work together with me?</i>
<i>Ahjussi!</i>
Where did you go?
I waited for a long time.
Let's go.
<i>Come out.</i>
It's you again?
You'll really die if you're like this.
Shut up.
Did you think that I'd be grateful
because you saved me once?
Don't be fooled.
Don't move.
I told you, that there is no second time.
<i>Please kill me.</i>
<i>I said kill me.</i>
What's your reason for doing all this?
I came here to kill you,
<i>so why?</i>
<i>What's your reason?</i>
For what must you do this?
<i>Just go back now.</i>
I have nowhere to go back to.
If I don't kill you...
I have no place to go to.
Then kill me.
However, it can't be now,
since there's something I must do.
After that's done,
whatever it is, do as you wish.
<i>If you don't want to die,
then it's a good idea to drink it.</i>
<i>What's your reason for doing all this?</i>
<i>I came here to kill you,</i>
so why?
<i>What's your reason?</i>
For what must you do this?
Uhm...
I also want to help out a bit,
would that be all right?
Thanks, Yuki.
Leave it there and go.
I don't know what's what.
<i>Not that one.</i>
Should we get this one?
Excuse me, this one please.
<i>Yes. Wait a minute please.</i>
No, no. Don't grab it like that.
You must take it like this.
There's a sad story about this statue.
What... is the story?
You just said so,
that there's a sad story about the statue.
I don't believe in stuff like that.
<i>Because I miss</i>
<i>Your laughter that I hear whenever</i>
<i>the cold wind brushes the tip of my fingers,</i>
<i>Your two eyes that reflected my face,</i>
<i>because I'm lonely, I cry and cry again.</i>
<i>The words I couldn't say,</i>
<i>since my lips were frozen...</i>
However, it can't be now,
since there's something I must do.
<i>After that's done,
whatever it is, do as you wish.</i>
<i>There's a place
I need to go to for a short while.</i>
<i>Seon Hwa.</i>
<i>Hey, Seung Hee.</i>
Hey, come in.
I have something to tell you.
Do you remember Kim Seon Hwa?
She was arrested.
<i>In Sokcho, Kangwon district,</i>
there was a case of an armed
runaway soldier in squad 360
<i>and the regiment that was tracking
him down caught her coincidentally.</i>
She's being transported
to the NSS right now.
<i>According to the police report,</i>
she had two Russian Makarov pistols
in her possession when she was captured,
but the peculiar thing is that
among Kim Seon Hwa's possessions,
there were documents
about director Baek San.
Even if she's a special agent
from the North,
don't you think it's weird that she had
information about our organization, no...
<i>I mean about our vice-director?</i>
Huh? Team leader!
<i>Have you guys been doing all right?</i>
How could we have been all right
when you weren't here?
Are you coming back to work now?
No, I just came here to see the director.
See you guys later.
I think she's gotten prettier.
What?
<i>Why don't you just
come back to work now?</i>
<i>Seung Hee.</i>
I came here because
I have a favor to ask of you, Director.
What is it?
Let me meet Kim Seon Hwa.
That information...
<i>Who did you hear it from?</i>
You're not even an agent right now.
<i>We can't have an outsider like you
interrogate an important suspect like her.</i>
Section chief!
There are some rules
we have to follow without question.
If you really want to do it,
then make an official reinstatement.
There are lots of others
to do the job even if it isn't you.
So did you find out anything?
- Give me a chance.
- Don't be arrogant.
<i>You know better that you can't do this.</i>
Director.
Go meet her.
Help her with whatever she needs.
Ms. Kim Seon Hwa.
This is the photo you had, right?
Why is that?
How did you...
acquire this photograph?
<i>What I want to know</i>
is not why you came here.
The man who was in Budapest back then...
that man...
I want to know if he's alive or not.
Is he alive?
I do not know.
I'm not interrogating you right now.
I'm asking you for a favor.
Please tell me.
<i>Choi Seung Hee! Open the door!</i>
<i>Hey, Choi Seung Hee!
Hurry and open the door!</i>
<i>Choi Seung Hee!
Aren't you going to open the door?</i>
I think I'll have to stop here.
<i>Hey, Choi Seung Hee!</i>
Now those people will interrogate you.
<i>Hey, Choi Seung Hee!</i>
You know that it'll be hard for you
to last even though you've gone
<i>through special training, right?</i>
<i>Hey, Choi Seung Hee. Hurry and
open the door. Hey! Choi Seung Hee!</i>
- Choi Seung Hee.
- We'll see each other again.
<i>Hurry and open the door!</i>
<i>Choi Seung Hee! Open the door!</i>
<i>Hey, Choi Seung Hee!
Hurry and open the door!</i>
<i>Choi Seung Hee!</i>
<i>Aren't you going to open the door?</i>
What are you doing right now!
I'm sorry.
You do the interrogation.
<i>Section chief Yang Jeong In.</i>
Do you have some time?
You meet Ms. Seung Hee
from time to time, right?
Yes, since she's my friend.
I know that there's an information leaked
from the NSS because of you,
section chief Yang Jeong In.
You're probably thinking
that it's not a big problem
since it's for Ms. Seung Hee,
but it's much more serious because of that.
- Why is that?
- It's because the information you leaked
can lead Ms. Seung Hee into danger.
<i>I'm warning you.</i>
Don't ever do it again.
It's a seizure from a violent reaction
to a poisonous substance.
<i>Call an ambulance.</i>
Since she is an important suspect,
we need permission to do so.
<i>- Can't you deal with it here?
- No!</i>
<i>Hurry and go get the permission.</i>
<i>Her internal bleeding is very serious.</i>
- Vasopressin 2cc.
- Injecting 2cc of Vasopressin.
<i>Shall we start then?</i>
