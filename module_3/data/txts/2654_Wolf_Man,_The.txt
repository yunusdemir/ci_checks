Talbot Castle, Mr Larry.
- Welcome home, Larry.
- I'm mighty glad to be here, Father.
Hasn't changed much.
Not in 300 years, except some modern
conveniences. Know Paul Montford?
- Sure.
- Just came to say hello. Welcome home.
- We used to snitch apples together.
- Now he's chief constable.
And I've got to get to work.
See you tonight about nine, Sir John.
- Glad to have you back, Larry.
- Thanks. Bye-bye.
- So, old Paul turned out to be a cop, huh?
- Cop?
- Yeah. A cop, policeman, you know.
- He's Captain Montford. Retired.
Father.
I'm sorry about John.
Your brother's death
was a blow to all of us.
Sit down, won't you?
You know, Larry, there has developed
a tradition about the Talbot sons.
The elder, next in line of succession,
is considered in everything.
The younger frequently resents his
position and leaves home, just as you did.
- Yes. But, Father, I'm here now.
- Fortunately.
But isn't it sad it took a hunting accident
and your brother's death to bring you?
It isn't as bad as it sounds.
I watched every bit of news about you.
I was mighty proud
when you won the prize for research.
The whole business is probably my fault.
The tradition also insists the Talbots be
the stiff-necked, undemonstrative type.
Frequently this has been
carried to unhappy extremes.
Don't I know that!
Larry, let's decide, you and I,
that between us
there shall be no more such reserve.
- I'll do everything that I can, sir.
- That should be considerable.
The 18 years you've been away should've
qualified you to be of benefit to the estate,
since in a great many ways we are
a backward people, but don't quote me.
- What have you got?
- It's from London, sir.
I think it's the new part for the telescope.
Oh, of course. Come along, Larry.
Come on. Up to the attic.
It's an observatory now.
There you are, sir. I think that has it.
I'll have a look at it.
It's excellent. Where'd you learn
such precision work?
Optical company in California.
We did quite a job on
that Mount Wilson Observatory.
- Are you interested in astronomy?
- Not especially.
I'm all right with tools. I've done quite a
little work with astronomical instruments,
but when it comes to theory
I'm pretty much of an amateur.
All astronomers are amateurs.
When it comes to the heavens,
there's only one professional.
Fine.
Well, I've got some things to do
before lunch. I'll leave you to it.
Good afternoon, sir. May I help you?
Why, yes. I'm looking for a gift.
Something in earrings.
Certainly. We have some very nice ones.
There's these diamond ones.
They're very smart.
- Or how about these pearl ones?
- No, I don't think any of those will do.
What I'm really looking for is something
half-moon shaped with spangles on it.
- Golden.
- Sorry. We haven't any like that just now.
Oh, yes, you have. Don't you remember?
On your dressing table up in your room.
- In my room?
- Yes.
- Would you mind getting them for me?
- Well... but... they're not for sale.
Well, I can't say that I blame you.
They look so well on you.
Well, perhaps my father can help you.
- I'll call him.
- That won't be necessary.
As long as I can't have the earrings,
perhaps I'll buy a cane, huh?
Tell me, how did you know
about the earrings in my room?
I'm psychic. Every time I see a beautiful
girl, I know all about her, just like that.
Oh.
Well, what kind of cane would you like?
We have day wear or evening wear.
It doesn't matter.
There's this one that's very smart.
Solid-gold top.
No, I don't think that'll do.
Well, how about the little dog?
That would suit you.
No, thanks.
Well, here's one.
- Make a good putter.
- Yes, it would.
That's funny. Another dog.
No, that's a wolf.
- A wolf?
- Mm-hm.
(Larry) A wolf and a star.
- What does that mean?
- I thought you said you were psychic.
I am, but this is only wood and silver,
and it hasn't blue eyes.
- Well, that stick is priced at three pounds.
- Three pounds? $15 for an old stick?
That's a rare piece. It shows the wolf and
the pentagram - the sign of the werewolf.
Werewolf? What's that?
That's a human being who at certain
times of the year changes into a wolf.
You mean runs around on all fours and
bites and snaps and bays at the moon?
Oh, even worse than that sometimes.
"What big eyes you have, Grandma. "
Little Red Riding Hood
was a werewolf story.
Of course, there have been many others.
There's an old poem:
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane
blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
Yes, but what's this pentagram business?
Every werewolf is marked with it and sees
it in the palm of his next victim's hand.
Look, lady, if you're trying to scare me
outta here, you're not getting very far.
I'll take the cane.
Please tell me.
Have you ever seen me before?
Of course. How do you suppose
I knew about the earrings?
- I can't remember ever...
- Tell you what we'll do.
We'll take a little walk tonight
and we'll talk it over.
- No.
- (rumbling)
- See you at eight.
- No.
- Gypsies, huh?
- Yes. They're fortune-tellers.
They pass through here every autumn.
You know, I haven't had my fortune
told in years. How about tonight?
No.
Fine. I'll be here at eight.
- Yes, that's the sign of the werewolf.
- That's just a legend though, isn't it?
Yes, but like most legends
it must have some basis in fact.
It's probably an ancient explanation
of the dual personality in each of us.
How does it go?
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane
blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
That's funny. That's the same thing
the girl in the antique shop said.
Oh, you've met Gwen Conliffe, have you?
So that's her name.
- Uh, I was just looking the town over.
- Naturally.
Continue to look it over.
I want you to know not only the girls, but
the old men and women and young men.
Get to know about them.
They're nice people.
They're your people.
After all, you're going to run the estate.
Of course, I wanna know all of them.
You seem to have made
a pretty good start.
Run along. Get on with the good work.
All right. Thanks. Good night.
Good night.
(clock chimes strike eight)
Oh!
- It's you.
- Why, of course.
- Who did you expect?
- Why, nobody.
I told you I couldn't go out with you.
And yet you wore
those earrings that I like.
- That was just because I...
- Oh, come on. I don't wanna go alone.
I'm really afraid of the dark.
And, you see, I wore my cane, too.
Jenny.
This is Jenny Williams.
She wants to have her fortune told, too.
- I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Just call me Larry.
If you don't mind... Larry.
Well...
(girls giggle)
Oh, look!
Oh, wolfbane.
Mm.
"Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers by night,
May become a wolf when the wolfbane
blooms and the autumn moon is bright. "
- So you know that one, too, huh?
- Of course.
Everyone knows about werewolves.
We've come to have our fortunes told.
Can you really read the future?
I will not disappoint you, my lady.
- Will you step inside, please?
- Do you mind if I go in first?
No, no. Go right ahead.
Go on, silly.
Quite a pipe the old boy's got, isn't it?
Cut the cards.
We didn't come down
to listen in on Jenny, did we?
No.
Well, maybe if you took a little walk
with me, I could tell your fortune.
- So you're a fortune-teller?
- Uh-huh.
- Is it how you knew about the earrings?
- Well, not exactly.
A telescope has a mighty sharp eye.
It brings the stars so close
you feel you can touch them.
- A telescope?
- Sure.
It does the same to people in their rooms,
if you point it in the right direction.
- Oh, you wouldn't.
- Well, I was only testing the refractor.
I didn't know about you,
and all of a sudden there you were.
From now on I'll be sure
to draw the curtains.
Oh, don't do that.
I mean, not on account of me. I mean...
Well, you know what I mean.
Yes, I'm afraid I do.
But it's only fair to tell you I'm engaged.
I'm going to be married very soon.
- In fact, I really shouldn't be here.
- Oh, but you are here.
Can you tell me
when I'm going to be married?
What did you see?
Your hands, please?
Your left hand shows your past.
Your right hand shows your future.
What's the matter?
I can't tell you anything tonight.
Come back tomorrow.
What did you see? Something evil?
No, no. Now go away.
Go quickly!
- Go!
- Yes!
Yes, I'm going!
(howling)
- What was that?
- I don't know.
- I've never heard anything like it before.
- (screaming)
Stay here.
Larry!
Wait! Larry!
Larry, where are you?
Oh, Larry. Larry, what happened?
What's the matter?
A wolf.
Help! Help!
Oh, please, hurry.
Hurry, please.
- What happened to him?
- A wolf bit him.
Do something. Can't you help him?
We must take him home.
- Big boy, isn't he?
- Huge.
- Like the Red Talbot.
- Should have had him in the Guards.
Oh, no! He'll be invaluable here
looking after the estate.
He's had a lot of experience in America.
Here, here, what's the matter?
Sir John!
- What happened?
- He was bitten by a wolf.
- A wolf?
- There haven't been wolves for years.
- Where?
- By the marsh. That woman came to help.
- Where is she?
- Who?
The Gypsy. I'd not have
got him here without her.
- The old woman who was in the doorway.
- Find her.
- Was there anyone else with you?
- Jenny. Someone get Jenny.
- Sir John! Captain! By the marsh.
- Yes, yes, by the marsh?
- Speak up, man.
- Jenny. Jenny Williams.
- What about her?
- She's been murdered, sir.
Wolf, Gypsy, murder! What is this?
- What makes you say she was murdered?
- Her throat, sir.
Let's look into this.
Show me where it happened.
- I'll send Dr Lloyd, Sir John.
- Roberts, give me a hand with Larry.
Get him up to his room.
- Mr Twiddle.
- Yes, sir?
- Take a note, Twiddle.
- Very good, sir.
Jenny Williams attacked by
some large animal. That right, Dr Lloyd?
Her jugular was severed
by the bite of powerful teeth.
Cause of death: internal haemorrhage.
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm a little squeamish, sir.
- Don't be. Write down what I told you.
- Very well, sir.
Captain Montford! Here, sir.
It's the Gypsy who passed
through town this afternoon.
Was he killed by
the same animal, Dr Lloyd?
No. His skull was crushed
by heavy blows with a sharp instrument.
Take a note, Twiddle: Bela the Gypsy
found dead near body of Jenny Williams.
Cause of death:
heavy blows from sharp instrument.
- Look. His feet are bare.
- So they are.
Otherwise he's fully dressed.
Make a note of that.
- Very well, sir.
- What's this?
Ooh!
- A stick with a horse's-head handle.
- It's not a horse's head. It's a wolf's head.
Mr Frank, them tracks back there - a wolf!
- Take a note.
- Very well, sir.
Found on scene of tragedy: silver-handled
stick mounted with a wolf's head.
- Let's have a look at those tracks.
- (Twiddle moans)
(knocking)
(knocking continues)
Larry, shouldn't you be in your bed?
- Well, no. I'm all right.
- Good morning, Larry.
- This is Dr Lloyd.
- You frightened us last night, my boy.
I'm sorry. I guess I did kind of pass out.
Is this your stick?
Why, of course.
That's the one I killed the wolf with.
Larry, Bela the Gypsy
was killed last night.
They found your stick by the body.
You mean... Bela the fortune-teller?
Mm-hm.
Well...
I only saw a wolf.
He bit me. Look here.
Well...
that's funny.
It must have healed up.
Larry, Paul wants to ask you
some questions.
- Why, sure. Go ahead.
- No, we ought to leave him alone.
What's the matter with you?
Paul wants to question him. Go ahead.
Yeah, but don't try to make me believe
I killed a man when I know I killed a wolf.
Yes, yes. We're all a little bit confused.
He needs a good rest.
We'll talk to you later, Larry.
Come on, Doctor.
Coming, Sir John?
Yeah, I'll be down in a minute.
Larry, stop worrying
and let me handle this.
But they're treating me like I was crazy!
I'm not accusing him of foul play, but two
people are dead and I am chief constable.
No reason to make a mystery out of it.
You talk like a detective in a novel.
Please, gentlemen,
there's a simple explanation.
A dog or a wolf attacked Jenny Williams.
She cried for help,
Larry and Bela went to her rescue.
It was dark. Excitement and confusion,
the Gypsy was killed.
- What about Bela's bare feet?
- He didn't have time to put his shoes on.
- This nonexistent wound?
- Larry imagined he was bitten.
- The beast tore his coat to shreds.
- Still he insists he received a wound.
You tell me his coat was bloody.
Surely a wound can't heal overnight.
The patient is mentally disturbed.
Perhaps the shock did it.
I'd rather you didn't bother him
with questions just now.
You policemen, always in such a hurry.
As if dead men hadn't all eternity.
You'll be declaring me a mental case next.
Oh, no, I wouldn't dare.
Thank you. In return, I won't question
your patient again until you think fit.
Thank you.
- It's the Gypsy fortune-teller.
- And the man that killed him.
(man) My dear woman, we can't
bury this man without prayer.
There is nothing to pray for, sir. Bela
has entered a much better world than this.
At least so you ministers always say, sir.
And so it is. But that's no reason
to hold a pagan celebration.
I hear your people are coming to town
dancing and singing and making merry.
For a thousand years we Gypsies
have buried our dead like that.
I couldn't break the custom,
even if I wanted to.
Fighting against superstition is
as hard as fighting against Satan himself.
The way you walked was thorny,
through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil,
the river enters the sea,
so tears run to a predestined end.
Your suffering is over, Bela, my son.
Now you will find peace.
But, my dear, there's nothing
they can accuse you of.
Now, here, why don't you go up
to your room and lie down?
I don't want to be alone, Father.
As soon as I close my eyes, I see Jenny.
I'd rather stay here.
Why, of course, my dear. Of course.
- Ladies, what can I do for you?
- Where is she?
- What do you want to know?
- Why she left my Jenny with the Gypsy.
She didn't want to be there
while the fortune was told.
What a lie. She just
wanted to walk out in the...
- You mustn't speak of my Gwen like that!
- Listen. There's a fine father for you.
How dare you let her walk out
with other men when she's engaged?
- She didn't do anything wrong.
- It's because of her my Jenny was killed.
- Now, that's enough!
- She's to blame.
- I knew that innocent face was just...
- Outside! Outside, all of you!
I want the truth. What was she doing while
my little Jenny was being murdered?
- I'll tell you what she was doing!
- All right, tell me!
Come on, come on.
Speak up. What was it?
Don't you dare touch me.
You and your fine daughter.
You've not heard the last of this!
- What's gotten into them?
- I really don't know.
I'm sorry, sir, about getting Gwen into this
mess, but there wasn't anything wrong.
I trust my daughter, sir.
I hope that she didn't hear all this row.
- Tell me, is she in?
- Yes, she's in the parlour.
- May I see her, please?
- Why, of course.
Thank you.
Larry!
Oh, you... You heard them.
Yes.
I suppose you can't
blame them too much.
Kind of a mess, isn't it?
I came over to tell you
how sorry I am about Jenny.
Tell me, just exactly what did happen?
Well, I saw a wolf attacking her
and I killed it.
In the fight it bit me. This morning
there's no sign of the wound.
Now they're trying to make me believe
that I killed Bela the fortune-teller.
Well, maybe there wasn't a wolf.
It was dark and foggy and, well,
perhaps the story I told you
about the werewolf confused you.
Why does everyone insist
that I'm confused?
(shop bell)
- Hello, Frank.
- Mr Conliffe. Is Gwen in?
Yes, but she has a visitor.
- Larry Talbot?
- Yes.
Well, that's all right. I want to see him, too.
Larry, this is Frank Andrews.
(barking)
Quiet.
You'd better take him outside, Frank.
All right. Come on, come on.
- So that's him, huh?
- Yes. We grew up together.
He looks like a nice enough chap.
What does he do?
He's the gamekeeper
for your father's estate.
Oh.
Glad to know you, Andrews.
I just came over to see
that Gwen was all right.
I guess I'd better be going now.
Goodbye, Gwen.
Goodbye.
Frank, why were you so rude?
Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't take
my eyes off that walking stick of his.
- Gwen, be careful, will you?
- Careful?
Yes. He's been away for 18 years, I know,
but he's still the son of Sir John Talbot.
Oh, I see. And I'm the daughter of Conliffe
who owns the antique shop. Is that it?
Yes. That and...
Well, there's something
very tragic about that man.
And I'm sure that nothing but harm
will come to you through him.
(* lively folk tune)
Aren't you glad I brought you?
There's Larry Talbot.
Let's go and say hello, eh?
I just wanted to show you
that I'm not jealous.
(Frank) Larry Talbot!
Saw you by yourself.
Thought you might like to join us.
- Thanks. I was just on my way home.
- Don't say that. We'll have fun together.
- Please do, Larry.
- Two guns, please.
Yes, sir.
- See what you can do.
- All right.
He seems to be able to handle a rifle.
Go ahead and shoot before he bites you.
Bad luck.
See? Nothing to it.
Care to try another one?
No, thanks. You win.
He's unstrung.
Long trip. That unfortunate
accident the other night.
- You've been a long while coming.
- I'm not buying anything.
And I am not selling anything.
I expected you sooner.
Oh, I remember you.
That night. And in the crypt.
Go inside.
- You killed the wolf.
- Well, there's no crime in that, is there?
The wolf was Bela.
You think I don't know the difference
between a wolf and a man?
Bela became a wolf and you killed him.
A werewolf can be killed
only with a silver bullet or a silver knife.
Or a stick with a silver handle.
You're insane. I tell you, I killed a wolf.
A plain, ordinary wolf!
Take this charm.
The pentagram - the sign of the wolf.
It can break the evil spell.
Evil spell, pentagram, wolfbane! I'm sick
of the whole thing. I'm getting out of here!
Whoever is bitten by a werewolf and lives
becomes a werewolf himself.
Quit handing me that.
You're just wasting your time.
The wolf bit you, didn't he?
Yeah. Yeah, he did.
Wear this charm over your heart always.
- I'll take it. What's it worth to you?
- Do you dare to show me the wound?
- What?
- Do you dare to show me the wound?
Go now,
and heaven help you.
- Oh, Larry.
- Gwen.
Gosh, I'm glad to see you.
I thought you left with Frank.
Oh, we had a quarrel and I...
Well, I'll take you home, then.
We better go this way.
- Quite a hectic night, wasn't it?
- Yes.
What's that?
Oh, that?
That's a charm.
I just saw the old Gypsy woman.
- They give quite a sales talk, don't they?
- Let me see.
The pentagram.
Yes.
She said that I was a werewolf.
Oh, but surely... you don't believe that...
Gwen, I won't need this.
I want you to have it.
It'll protect you.
Protect me?
- From whom?
- Me.
Just in case.
I never accept a present
without giving something in return.
Here's a penny.
That isn't enough.
- Why, the Gypsies are all leaving.
- I must go, too!
But, Gwen!
- Hey, hey, hey. What's all the excitement?
- There's a werewolf in the camp!
(howling)
(baying)
- Did you hear that, Mr Twiddle?
- Of course I did.
Otherwise I'd be snug and warm in bed.
- Sounded like a wild animal.
- Might be a beast the Gypsies left behind.
It seemed to come from the churchyard.
- Don't stand talking. Let's go and see.
- Very well. Let us go and have a look.
- Morning, gentlemen.
- Morning.
- Morning, Captain.
- It could be a better one, Doctor.
- Morning, Twiddle.
- Morning, Doctor.
- Richardson, eh?
- Yes.
Severed jugular.
Isn't that the way
Jenny Williams was killed?
Yes.
- Find something?
- Animal tracks.
A wolf.
Morning, Larry.
You're up early.
Why, yes. I heard people in the corridor.
Is there anything wrong?
Richardson was killed last night.
The gravedigger.
The tracks lead up to this house.
- Footprints?
- No, animal tracks. A wolf.
A wolf? Where do you suppose
a wolf came from?
He might have escaped
from a circus or a zoo.
What is this story
about a man turning into a wolf?
- You mean the werewolf?
- Yes, sir.
It's a legend. You'll find something like it
in the folklore of nearly every nation.
The scientific name for it is lycanthropia.
It's a variety of schizophrenia.
- That's all Greek to me.
- Well, it is Greek.
It's a technical expression
for something very simple.
The good and evil in every man's soul.
In this case,
evil takes the shape of an animal.
I can figure out most anything
if you give me
electric current, tubes and wires -
something I can do with my hands.
- But these things you can't even touch!
- What's the matter with you, Larry?
Well, nothing, sir.
But do you believe in these yarns?
Larry, to some people, life is very simple.
They decide that this is good, that is bad.
This is wrong, that's right.
There's no right in wrong,
no good in bad.
No shadings and greys,
all blacks and whites.
- That'd be Paul Montford.
- Exactly.
Others of us find that good, bad, right,
wrong, are many-sided, complex things.
We try to see every side,
but the more we see, the less sure we are.
Now, you asked me if I believe
a man can become a wolf.
If you mean "Can it take on physical
traits of an animal?" No, it's fantastic.
However, I do believe that most anything
can happen to a man in his own mind.
(bells chime)
Time for church.
You know, Larry, belief in the hereafter
is a very healthy counterbalance
to all the conflicting doubts man is
plagued with these days. Come on.
- Last night it got Richardson.
- Many's the grave he dug for others.
- Now they're digging one for him.
- I daren't go out for fear of that beast.
That beast? Has anybody ever seen it?
I don't think it even exists.
Strange there were no murders here
before Larry Talbot arrived.
Hold your tongue, Mrs Williams.
D'you know that's slander?
I know what I know. You should have seen
how he looked at me in Conliffe's shop.
Like a wild animal
with murder in his eyes.
Sh! Here he comes.
- Morning.
- A pleasure to see you, Sir John.
- How are you, Larry?
- Fine, thank you.
- Miss Conliffe.
- Come, my dear.
I'll send this cast
of the animal's tracks to Scotland Yard.
They'll laugh.
There's no question it's a wolf.
Probably hiding in the woods.
What about traps?
We must do something
before the town gets hysterical.
Yes, this muttering of werewolves.
Come along. We're discussing this wolf
that seems to be roaming the countryside.
Yes. You saw him.
What's he like? Is he a big fella?
- It isn't a wolf.
- What do you mean?
It's a werewolf.
Werewolf?
Maybe he's right.
Let's have a hunt and drive it out.
A valuable addition
to anybody's collection.
Imagine having a stuffed werewolf
staring at you from the wall.
(Dr Lloyd) I wouldn't joke about it, Paul.
Doctor, do you believe in werewolves?
I believe that a man lost in the mazes of
his mind may imagine that he's anything.
Science has many examples
of the mind's power over the body.
Case of the stigmata
appearing in the skin of zealots.
Self-hypnotism.
But if a man isn't even thinking
about the thing, isn't interested in it,
then how could he
hypnotise himself with it?
It might be a case of mental suggestion,
plus mass hypnotism.
You mean by that that he could be
influenced by the people about him?
Yes.
You're letting your science
run away with your common sense.
Have you ever met a werewolf, Doctor?
Not that I know of.
Doctor, can these sick people be cured?
Not they. An asylum's
the only safe place for them.
Any disease of the mind can be cured
with the cooperation of the patient.
While you men figure it out scientifically,
I'll go and set a few traps.
I'll help. We may not find anything
more than a diseased mind,
but even that may be interesting.
- Doctor, I've got to talk to you.
- Later. Now I want you to get some rest.
Go on, Larry.
- You're the one I want to talk to.
- I didn't like what you said to him.
Sir John, your son is a sick man.
He's received a shock
that has caused psychic maladjustment.
- You must send him away.
- You're talking like a witch doctor.
If my son is ill, the best place for him
is here, proving his innocence.
Does the prestige of your family name
mean more than your son?
Nonsense. The way for him to get cured is
to stay here and fight his way out of this.
And I tell you that shock therapy
is too strong for him at present.
Listen to me. Five generations of Talbots
haven't been affected by this village.
- That boy stays here!
- Oh, very well.
We'll see how he is in the morning.
- All right, sir.
- Last one, huh?
That ought to hold him.
(howling)
(dogs barking)
- They've lost the trail, sir.
- He can't have disappeared into thin air.
Take Phillips and work around the marsh.
See if you can pick up the trail there.
The way you walk is thorny,
through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil,
the river enters the sea,
so tears run to a predestined end.
Find peace for a moment, my son.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to help you.
(barking)
- Where am I? What happened?
- You are caught in the trap.
Here, here. Let me do that.
Hurry! The dogs, they are hunting you.
Hello, there. Stop!
Come here! You!
- It's Master Larry.
- What are you doing here, sir?
Why, the same thing that you are,
of course. Hunting.
- I hear you talking to someone?
- It was Master Larry.
All right. Go along.
- Who was that?
- Larry Talbot.
Larry.
Gwen, I'm going away.
Away? But why?
I gotta go. I can't stay here any longer.
Let me go with you. I'll fetch
a few things and be back in a minute.
No, no. I'm going alone.
But I can help you.
You wouldn't want
to run away with a murderer.
Larry, you're not. You know you're not.
I killed Bela. I killed Richardson.
If I stay around here much longer,
you can't tell who's gonna be next.
Wait.
- It... might even...
- Please.
I've still got the charm
you gave me. Remember?
Yeah, yeah, I know, but I'm afraid.
Larry, what is it?
Your hand!
- Can't see anything.
- Mr Talbot.
Father, I'm going with Larry.
No! It's no use!
Going out, Larry?
Father, I've gotta get away from here.
Bela the Gypsy was a werewolf.
I killed him with that silver cane.
I was bitten.
Look!
The pentagram.
That scar could be made
by most any animal.
Yes, but it's the sign of the werewolf.
They say that he can see it
in the palm of the hand of his next victim.
That's hard to believe.
I saw it.
- Tonight, in Gwen's hand.
- Larry, Larry.
How can I help you get rid of this fear,
this mental quagmire you've got into?
- What can I say to you?
- (dogs barking)
You don't understand.
You think I'm insane. Why...
- What's that?
- Paul Montford and the men.
- They're hunting the wolf.
- They're out hunting for me.
Stop it! Stop it!
You can't run away.
That's it.
- That's what she said.
- Who?
The Gypsy woman.
Gypsy woman?
Now we're getting down to it.
She's filled your mind with this gibberish,
this talk of werewolves and pentagrams.
You're not a child but a man. And you
believe in the superstitions of a Gypsy!
No, but the scar,
the footprints in my room!
Look, Father, I was caught in a trap
tonight. I don't know how I got there.
The Gypsy woman helped me get away,
and now they're all out hunting for me.
Listen to me. You're Laurence Talbot.
This is Talbot Castle.
You believe those men can come in here
and take you out?
No.
I'll go out to them.
I can't help myself.
Then I'll see to it that
you can't go out to them.
Come on, Larry.
There.
You're fast to the chair.
All the windows are locked.
I'll bolt the door
so that nothing can get in or out.
Now you'll see that this evil thing
you've conjured up is in your mind.
- Sir John.
- Yes?
Captain Montford and the men
are waiting for you and Master Larry.
- I'm coming.
- You're going to stay with me, aren't you?
I've got to go.
These people have a problem.
You must make your own fight,
but we'll settle this thing tonight.
- Dad?
- What is it?
Take the cane with you.
- What do I want with a cane?
- Please.
Just take it with you. Please.
All right.
(shuts and bolts door)
He should come across through there.
The beaters'll drive him
right towards this point.
- Did you give your son the sleeping pill?
- Oh, no.
- I wanted him to sleep through all this.
- And I want him cured tonight.
In the morning you'll have proof
it was in his mind.
- What did you do?
- Strapped him to the chair.
Turned him to the window
so he can see the hunt.
I hope you won't be sorry.
Dr Lloyd.
Coming.
You are not frightened, are you, Sir John?
- Frightened? Of what?
- Of the night.
- Rubbish. You startled me.
- Don't be startled, Sir John.
You have the silver cane for protection.
- Who are you?
- Hasn't your son told you?
You've been filling his mind
with this werewolf nonsense.
- Nonsense, Sir John?
- Yes.
Preying on his gullibility
with your witches' tales.
But you fixed him, didn't you, Sir John?
- You don't believe witches' tales, do you?
- Not for a minute.
Then where were you going, Sir John?
Why aren't you back there,
at the shooting stand?
- I was.
- Were you hurrying back to the castle?
Did you have a moment's doubt? Were
you hurrying to make sure he's all right?
I wanted to be with my son.
- I was going...
- (gunfire)
- Yes, Sir John? You were going?
- (gunfire continues)
Hurry, Sir John. Hurry.
Come around this way, men!
- Swing to the right, come through again.
- White, take charge.
- I could have sworn I hit him dead on.
- And I, too.
Have you forgotten?
It takes a silver bullet for a werewolf.
- Have you seen Larry?
- Don't go in the woods.
- Why?
- Listen. The hunt is on.
- But I want to help him.
- You'd better come with me.
Oh, no! I've got to find him.
Come with me, or he will find you!
Oh.
(growls)
(screams)
(growls)
The way you walked was thorny,
through no fault of your own.
But as the rain enters the soil,
the river enters the sea,
so tears run to a predestined end.
Your suffering is over.
Now you will find peace for eternity.
Down this way, men!
Gwen.
Are you all right?
The wolf must have attacked her
and Larry came to the rescue.
I'm sorry, Sir John.
Larry!
