Hi.
I'm Larry Daley. I'm head

I know who you are. You're

Yeah, also head
of the Night Program.
I'm doing some research...
and I was wondering
if you could help me out.
Mmm. Night guard doing research.
Ooh la-la!
Yeah.
Uh, I'm just looking
for anything
that you might have
on the tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Center aisle.
- Great.
- Halfway down, stacks on your left.
<font color="#808080">(GROANS)</font>
Get it!
So...
what makes you so curious
about the tablet?
Oh! Just, uh...
Just a hobby, you know? Kind
of an interest of mine.
I wish I could talk
to these guys.
Well, you can't.
Yeah.
Because they're dead.
Right.

Hey, Gus. You're looking well.

Are you here to frame us again?

I don't think this

<font color="#804040">REGINALD</font>: We've put all that tablet
stuff behind us, Larry.
It's old news.
Besides, we really never knew
anything about that old tablet.

Maybe this kid can.
Maybe we'd better talk alone.

I tried to move on...
but there was something
about that tablet.
It's turning green,
like some sort of corrosion.
And something's happening
to Teddy and Dexter...
Jed and Octavius.
They're all acting weird.
It's like the green
rust is affecting them.
"The end will come."
What?
The locals, they warned us.
They begged us to leave
that tomb alone.
I thought it meant
the end of the world.
But maybe it meant the end...
End of the magic?
We should have listened.
Should have listened.
Instead, we shipped Ahk
and the tablet off to New York...
and his folks to England.
Wait. Wait.
Ahkmenrah's parents
are in England?
It was a joint expedition.
Some of the artifacts
stayed in Egypt.
The rest was divided up between New
York and the British Museum.
Ahk said that his father knew
the secrets of the tablet.
I think I have
to go talk to him.
- I need you to listen to me.
- Uh...
Our esteemed chairwoman
asked for my resignation.
She said, since the Night
Program was my brainchild...
that the buck starts
and stops with me.
- I can fix it.
- How?
I need you to let me take
the tablet and Ahkmenrah to London.

Yes.
I actually live

I know, but it doesn't

Yeah.
We would be very honored if you
could take a look at the tablet.
There's something
happening with it.
We don't understand what it is.
You are speaking with a pharaoh.
Kiss my staff.
Is it okay if I don't?
You will show respect.
I am the descendant
of Ra, the sun god.
I understand that and I totally
respect you.
I just don't pray to Ra, so...
The Egyptian gods
are the only true gods.

a little more open-minded.

There's something wrong with it.

Do you think you could fix it?
To do that, I would have to divulge
the secret of the tablet.
I promise we won't tell anybody.
No.
I'll kiss your staff.
Too late.
Father, why do you insist
on keeping this to yourself?
The secret was to be passed
down to you at the proper time.
Well, it has been 4,000 years.
Now seems like a good time.
You were born at midnight.
I was Pharaoh...
and I had seen wonders
most men only dream of.
- But when I first gazed upon you...
- <font color="#808080">(COOING)</font>
you were instantly
more precious to me...
than all the wonders
of the ancient world.
I knew I could never
bear to say goodbye.
I commanded the High Priest
to create a gift to you, my son...
using all we had learned
of the mysteries of the afterlife.
Forged in the temple
of Khonsu, god of the moon...
- and watcher over nighttime travelers...
- <font color="#808080">(CHANTING)</font>
the Tablet of Ahkmenrah.
Our tomb was designed to channel
Khonsu's rays down to the tablet...
rejuvenating its
powers every night.
The moon god bestowed
his power upon the tablet...
so that, as long as it
bathed in his light...
our family could be
together forever,
and not even death
could part us.
It's been away
from Khonsu's light too long.
<font color="#808080">(GASPS)</font>

But just put it in the moonlight

Folks come to look at us, maybe
learn a little something.
That's alive, man.
But I'm...
I'm supposed to take
care of you guys.
And you have.
It's okay, Lawrence.
We're ready.
I'm not.
Let us go, son.
Okay.
Thank you for giving me
back my family, Larry...
Guardian of Brooklyn.
Dad, if we leave right now,
we can still catch a flight...
get home with everyone still
awake before the sun comes up.
Yeah, okay.
Let's go home.
Whoa!
It's all right, Larry.
We've reached something
of an understanding.
- Really?
- Trixey, sit.
Wow! That's really good.
Good job, Lance.
Thanks.
Trixey, behave.
Good girl.
Steady.
<font color="#804040">TILLY</font>: He never
even listens to me.
But you...
I just feel like you
really listen to me.
<font color="#808080">(LAAA GRUNTING)</font>
It's like our hearts are in perfect
sync with each other right now.
- Um... <font color="#808080">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>
- Do you feel what...
- Oh.
- Hi.
Sorry to interrupt whatever...
is happening.
Uh, Laaa, the guys are waiting outside.
We gotta go. Come on.
What? No.
No! Laaa, stay!
I know this sounds crazy...
but you and I could make a life
together here in England.
<font color="#808080">(GRUNTS ANGRILY)</font>
Whoa!
Wow. Okay. Um...
<font color="#808080">(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)</font>
I will never forget you.
<font color="#808080">(REPEATING INDISTINCTLY)</font>
You are the most rugged man
that I have ever, ever met.
<font color="#808080">(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)</font>
Keep the scrunchies.
Okay, Laaa. We gotta go.
Come on.
I won't say anything
if you won't.
Oh, I know you hate this job
and everything, but tomorrow night...
best job ever.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)</font>
<font color="#804040">JEDEDIAH</font>: Sure
is quiet around here.
<font color="#804040">OCTAVIUS</font>: Without the tablet,
it's just like any other museum.
You know what I'm gonna
remember most about you?
What?
How big you guys are.
Come here.
- <font color="#808080">(LAUGHS)</font>
- Come here.
Hold me.
My...
friend.
You speak English?
Okay.
Hey, listen. Um...
Up there on the roof, when...
- When you almost...
- <font color="#808080">(CHATTERING)</font>
Yeah.
I just want you to know...
I really changed
my perspective on everything.
I know we have a weird...
We have this dynamic,
we have this tension.
Back and forth.
I mean, games, right? You know?
Roles that we put ourselves into,
but why does it have to be that way?
I feel like there's always
been a mutual
sort of respect for each other.
Anyway.
I'll miss you, you know?
<font color="#808080">(CHATTERING)</font>
Okay. It's all right.
Go ahead. One last slap.
Yeah, I felt that was there
for a long time, too.
<font color="#808080">(MOUTHING)</font> Thank you.
Who would have ever thought?
I'm wax, she's polyurethane.
But somehow, it worked.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>
<font color="#808080">(SIGHS)</font>
I guess this is it.
Indeed.
And I know young Nick
will do great things.
Yeah, he's, uh...
ready to take on the world
all by himself.
Then you've done your job.
You've done your job.
It's time
for your next adventure.
I have no idea what I'm
gonna do tomorrow.
How exciting.
Bye, Teddy.
Farewell, Lawrence.
- Bully!
- <font color="#808080">(SCREAMS)</font>
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHING)</font> Got you!
Smile, my boy.
It's sunrise.
- Hey.
- Hey. You good?
- Yeah, I am.
- Good.
So, Ibiza?
Yeah. Uh...
The whole DJ thing, Dad...
I don't know
if that's the thing for me...
I just know
that it's the next thing.
After that, maybe college.
I'm figuring it
all out, you know?
Sounds like a plan.
I should get back
to Mom's, or something.
Okay.
I love you.
I love you, too.
All right.
I'm not gonna let you go.
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font> Okay.
I'll see you later.
<font color="#804040">DR. MCPHEE</font>: Three
years, no Larry Daley.
He was the one that took the fall
for me, got me my job back.
I heard he went back to school,
got his degree, became a teacher.
I'm very glad.
Well, when he heard about this
traveling exhibition...
Larry insisted that I deliver
this to you personally.
Ah! The infamous, supposedly
magic, glowing tablet.
Larry Daley
and his fanciful tales.
Larry said you could be trusted.
What do you mean?
<font color="#808080">(WHISPERING)</font> With the top
secret knowledge.
What are you doing?
- I'm winking.
- You're blinking.
No, I wink with both eyes.
That's blinking.
It doesn't matter,
because right now...
you better get ready!
For what?
For this.
It does glow.
Uh-huh.

Come on.
<font color="#808080">(MUSIC CONTINUES)</font>
Sorry.
Go ahead.
Have fun-fun, Dum Dum.
<font color="#808080">(CHATTERING)</font>

Stay!
I'm not going anywhere.
Stay!
I'm not going anywhere!
