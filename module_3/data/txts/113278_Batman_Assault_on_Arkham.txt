Riddler: <i> Riddle me this.</i>
<i>When is a door, not a door?</i>
<i>It feels like drowning,</i>
<i>doesn't it?</i>
<i>When the answer is</i>
<i>at the edge of your cortex,</i>
<i>but you can't seem to grasp it.</i>
Amanda: <i> You're trying</i>
<i>my patience.</i>
Riddler: <i> The answer...</i>
<i>When it's ajar!</i>
<i>Here is an easy one.</i>
<i>What runs around a city,</i>
<i>but never moves?</i>
No?
A wall!
<i>What do you want, nigma?</i>
I'm in charge so I'll
ask the questions.
Try to keep up, wont you?
Riddle me this.
What belongs to you,
but others use it more
than you do?
Amanda: <i> Your name.</i>
Huh!
You've heard that one!
No, I have Google,
like the rest of the world.
<i>Why do you talk to me</i>
<i>like this, waller?</i>
Simple, I needed to
keep you babbling
long enough to
pinpoint your position.
My... what?
Officer: Hands in the air,
where we can see them!
Amanda: <i> Take him out!</i>
Make it hurt!
(Grunts)
Riddle me this.
Why didn't I quit when
I was ahead?
What is it? Report!
Batman: The riddler is mine!
Officer: Switch to
night vision!
Secure the perimeter!
Holy crap! It's Batman!
(Grunts)
(Officers grunting)
(Projectile swishing)
Riddler: Ahh!
(Both grunts)
(Growling)
(Straining)
(Panting)
(Groans)
(Straining)
I know you helped him, nigma.
Tell me where it is.
(Buzzer beeps)
I'm invoking priority level,
ultraviolet.
Assemble task force x.
We have another suicide mission.
(Dubstep playing)
(Prisoners cheering)
(Motorbike engine revving)
(Alarm rings)
(Grunts)
(All groaning)
Captain boomerang: I got
the hangover,
but I don't recall the party.
Oh crap! Not this again!
You too?
It's like a bloody
recurring nightmare.
Looks like we've got rookies.
(Groaning)
Who are you people?
And why am I in uniform?
No bars!
No chains!
Time for meat!
(Squeals)
Ow!
You try it, fish fingers,
and I'll show you the meaning
of cold-blooded.
You're feisty.
Everybody! Shut up!
- I've been here before.
- (Shouting)
(Growls)
I am leaving!
Stop!
Sit down!
I'm Amanda waller.
I'm here to indoctrinate
you convicts into
our special forces.
Killer frost: Pass.
I kill to keep degenerates
off the streets.
I won't work alongside them.
Fresh air and term
off my sentence?
Feel free to keep
calling me up, love.
Task force x is
an off-the-books
government strike team,
made up of convicts
with no hope for release,
serving as expendable agents,
for impossible missions.
Succeed, and I'll shave
time off your sentences.
If we don't?
You'll be dead!
Any other stupid questions?
Yeah, what's in my neck?
A tracker?
Yes, and a powerful
nanotech explosive.
Run away, get yourself captured,
disobey an order,
hell, give me a right
answer too slowly,
and I'll blow your
head clean off!
Kgbeast: You're lying.
You would not take all of this
trouble, just to kill us.
Try me!
(Beeping)
(Screams)
Anyone else?
I didn't think so.
What's so dangerous this
time that you had to send
in the newbies?
You're going to break
into arkham asylum.
- That's insane!
- You don't know much, do you?
Screw that!
I don't do freaky deaky's.
Yahtzee!
How do we start?
Oh, I like you, cowboy.
You're <i> loco!</i>
And me likey your locomotion!
- Ahh!
- What's the plan?
A week ago, while in my employ,
a low life calling himself
the riddler managed to gain
access to my computer system.
He downloaded a file
containing the identities
and histories of every
current, past and potential
member of the suicide squad.
Including ours?
That's right!
He's threatening to release
them all on the Internet.
You're going to get it back.
Riddler's got one copy,
and it's on a thumb
drive in his cane,
which is apparently
locked away in
the arkham property room.
In the intensive treatment
building, right under the
solitary confinement cells.
Good times!
So we get someone inside.
Is it me?
Can it be me?
Dibs!
She's a wild card.
Harley Quinn, has an
encyclopedic knowledge
of arkham's layout
and its logistics.
She gonna be okay
that close to the joker?
I'm fine, we're done.
He's a jerk! Whatever.
Well, I'm convinced.
You'll be snuck into Gotham.
You'll rendezvous with a power
broker who will set
you up for the break in.
This is as off-the-grid
as it gets.
So let's keep the body
count to a minimum.
Deadshot, rubber bullets only.
What about the bat?
He has his hands full
on another case.
In fact, we work it right,
we might be able to take
advantage of him.
Waller!
What, lawton?
Play fair and I'll
shoot straight.
Jerk me around
and I'll kill you!
Be a good convict, lawton.
Don't make me blow you up.
I'm clear!
Gas them!
Harley: What?
(Gas hissing)
(Straining)
I'm getting tired of this trick.
You and me both, cowboy.
Maybe, when we
get into Gotham,
I can show you around.
I know some tight places.
- Not interested.
- Hmm.
I told you harley,
if you're giving it out,
heave a chunk my way, eh.
Eh! You wish!
Shake your boomerang
at the shark guy.
-Do it, and I
will bite it off.
-(Chuckles)
Come on, harl,
for old times' sake!
Are we gonna have a problem
this time around?
I think we might, mate.
Black spider: No!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I don't trust vermin.
Honorless, rudderless,
undisciplined.
They'll never find your body.
Harley: Oh, ninjas
are awesome!
(Grunts)
You think that means
we're there?
(All scream)
King shark: I hate heights!
(Straining)
(Harley laughing)
Harley: Whoo!
We're not going to make it!
Waller, please!
Ahh!
(Cackling)
Amanda: <i> Remember this feeling</i>
<i>convicts, I hold your lives</i>
<i>in my hands!</i>
You crazy bitch!
Open the damn chutes!
Do it, now!
(All screaming)
(Screams)
Good one! Good shark!
Oh, Christ!
Where's harley?
Don't worry!
I fell on my head.
Great! Now, how do we get
to the rendezvous unseen?
A few more Miles.
Keep moving, then.
(Groaning)
(Exclaims)
This is flipping bonkers!
Sloshing through the sewage
so a guy dressed like
a bat won't spot us.
You want to head
top side, slick?
Be my guest!
Nah! We're practically there.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
(Music playing in distance)
Cobblepot!
Man: We're closed!
Private party!
Yeah, we're the private party!
This way. He's waiting on you.
Your guests have arrived,
Mr. cobblepot.
Right, right. Come in!
Welcome to the iceberg lounge.
I'm just finishing my supper.
Pardon me, Mr. cobblepot.
Lawton. Oh, I never pegged
deadshot for a team player.
Oh, things are tough
all over, sir.
That's a good one!
This man is the best
assassin I've ever seen.
And I only work with the best.
I aim to please,
Mr. cobblepot.
I was told you can
get us into arkham.
I can, indeed.
I've made arrangements to
sneak you into the crazy farm.
Follow them to...
You!
Clown!
You're still not mad about
that truck, are you, pengie?
Wah, wah.
It feels like you are.
You cost me money, funny girl!
Her and her loony boyfriend
lit my truck a cigarette
and drove it into the river!
Just for a laugh!
Does it matter that
Mr. j and I aren't
together anymore?
Nobody steals from me
and walks away!
It's bad business, love!
You're right,
you should kill her!
Hell, I'll kill her for you!
Oh, come on!
Except, you know what else
is bad for business, sir?
Double crossing your clients.
And I would hate for folks
to say, "Mr. cobblepot takes
your money
"and kills your operatives."
Get her out of my sight, lawton.
There's your files.
Memorize the contents.
You can grab some
shut-eye in the rooms above.
You deploy tomorrow night
under the cover of darkness.
And then, I never want to see
any of you on my turf again.
Now, get the hell out of here!
Never the charmer, aren't you?
Bite me, boomer!
(Men laughing)
Oy, lawton!
Nice shade, mate.
We got off on the wrong foot
at the start of this mission.
Hoist a pint with us.
Can't, it's a school night.
Suit yourself.
How about a friendly
game of darts, then?
All: Yeah!
(All gasp)
Lucky shot!
Right, let's see you do it.
All: Yeah!
Sorry mate.
Looks like that one
took a bad bounce.
Ow!
Let's call it even. Mate.
(Machine beeps)
Amanda: <i> Louise, it's Amanda,</i>
<i>I have a special</i>
<i>assignment for you.</i>
<i>Something I'd rather keep</i>
<i>between the two of us.</i>
I'm listening.
Welcome back!
- Did you miss me?
- What do you want?
I got an itch I thought
you could help me
scratch, cowboy.
(Screams)
Oh, good start!
Oh, what the hell?
(Deadshot groans)
(Crashing and clanking)
Harley: Yahtzee!
Here's my stop.
Wish me luck, cowboy.
Yeah!
(Grunts)
There's got to be
one here somewhere.
(Straining)
Batman: You know where
he put it, don't you?
Uh-oh.
Where is it, harley?
No idea, what you're
talking about.
Answers! Now!
(Harley grunts)
Back off, bats.
(Batman groans)
<i>Where is it?</i>
What's he talking about?
Who knows what these
wankers get worked up about?
I don't know, I swear.
I'm not firing blind
against the bat.
Waller, what the devil is
going on?
<i>You don't get to call me up</i>
<i>and demand answers, deadshot!</i>
What are they talking about?
<i>Joker stole a dirty bomb</i>
<i>and hid it somewhere</i>
<i>in Gotham.</i>
<i>Apparently, it's large enough</i>
<i>that the radiation would kill</i>
<i>half the population.</i>
<i>Batman's torn the city</i>
<i>apart trying to find it.</i>
<i>At one point he thought</i>
<i>riddler might know.</i>
The joker has a dirty bomb?
That gives me the chills.
Ice puns? Really?
Waller, this is crap.
<i>I don't care, convict.</i>
<i>Do your job!</i>
Honestly, b man, I don't
know where Mr. j puts
half of his stuff.
I just wanted a chatty boo-boo
doll before they went on sale
tomorrow.
(Sirens wailing)
Get her back to arkham!
Will do, Batman.
Get in there, you nutty broad.
(Car boot opening)
(Mumbling)
<i>I'm in the middle of lunch.</i>
<i>Now I've got to process</i>
<i>this crazy dame?</i>
Crazy, huh?
Why don't I just toss her in
her old cell, and come back.
Yeah, right. I've got like
half a dozen new forms
to fill up
before you can even come in.
We got ten minutes
to plant the device.
Captain boomerang:
Where should I dump her?
Put it through
the X-ray machine.
Guard: Heh, don't get
much deader than that.
This one's cold as ice.
Hey buddy, I got nothing
in the system about
accepting a new body.
Yeah! Ha-ha.
(Muffled protest)
(Thudding)
(Grunts)
It says, "not found."
I came from inside.
Run it again.
Nah, something's wrong.
I'm gonna to have
to get security.
Junction box is up ahead.
So move your ass.
Joker: Harley!
Is it really you?
Shit!
Don't screw this up.
Aren't you even
going to say hello?
Oh, guys,
you've got to see this.
Joker just spotted harley!
Keep walking.
Tell him to shut up.
Aw, I can tell
you're still sore.
At least the bruises
cleared up nicely.
What's your hurry, harl?
Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!
Damn it!
(Sighs) Let's move.
(Gunshots)
Maybe, she'll kill him.
I'm going to kill you!
I'll kill him! I'll kill him
myself for what
he's done to me!
Women! Am I right, officer?
Can't live with them,
can't kick them out
of a moving car.
You know the rules, buddy,
I got to phone it in.
She's dead!
How much trouble could she be?
Nothing goes in
or out of arkham
without being okayed.
But...
Give me a sec,
I'll try to get a hold
of the watch commander.
Run it again.
I tried twice, sir.
I can't lose this job
because your system is down.
Come on, you amateurs.
(Tutting) Sorry hon,
bulletproof.
Even better, puddin'.
Why, harley, if I didn't
know better, I'd say
you're trying to kill me.
We're finished, you and me!
I got someone new now,
someone better!
(Growling)
Oh, hell!
This will have to do.
Never mind, just came through.
About time!
Sorry, it's an old system.
No problem.
Let's see what goodies
we've got.
Oh, shit!
How the... ow!
Ahh! My goolies!
That's payback, you dumb ass.
Walk it off, captain kangaroo.
(Gas hissing)
Come on, we're out of time.
New guy?
That's right!
You're not jealous, are you?
That's him!
I know you.
We worked together once.
No, wait, don't tell me,
don't tell me. Hmm.
Deadhead, hmm? Buckshot?
(Harley squeals)
I got her!
You can have her!
Bet you buy your
shirts second hand too.
Sir, we've got an explosion
on level e.
He's still secure, sir.
Is that room service?
Tell them I never
got my calzone.
Good!
I need every available
security down in the kitchen.
Stat!
We're on yellow alert.
(All groaning)
You're late!
Ran in to her ex.
Grab hold!
King shark: Put your
back into it.
Hey! Nobody's supposed
to be down there!
Deadshot: Ah, we just snuck
down here for a little party.
(Harley giggling)
What kind of party?
Crap! You're harley Quinn!
Don't move, you crazy bitch.
(Screams)
Blech!
I hate Italian food.
Has that kitchen fire
been contained?
- Yes, sir.
- (Knocking on door)
Get here!
- Amanda: <i> Lawton!</i>
- What?
<i>GPS has you in the main</i>
<i>security hub.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>
We own it, that's what.
Now we grab the cane.
<i>Don't get to cocky, lawton.</i>
<i>You're at the point</i>
<i>of no return.</i>
<i>You best keep that in mind.</i>
That gas explosion
put the whole bloody
asylum on yellow alert.
If the security cameras
make us, we're toast.
So shut down all
the security cams.
That's a sure fire
way to alert the bat.
What then? Let him watch
us run around like idiots?
King shark: Play
yesterday's footage.
Aw, shark-wick had
his first thought.
Shut it, boomer! Say it again.
Play yesterday's footage
of the same time.
I can do that.
And we can operate
without eyes on us.
You mean Batman's or waller's.
Both!
The intensive treatment
building is there,
just across the yard.
Let's move!
Low profile.
Frost, move your ass.
(Thunder rumbling)
Top priority are those towers.
I can scale them.
No time.
You do two, I'll do two.
Fine!
On my mark.
Now!
You missed!
Wait for it.
Patrol, I need a sweep
of the yard!
Boom! In your face!
He got to his walky!
I'd score that a miss,
you two-bit c-lister!
That's it!
(Both grunting)
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
Boys, we got company!
Shark, no!
Finally, some action!
(Men groaning)
So much for low profile.
(Harley laughing)
Status report.
I got you in the exercise
yard, but you don't
show up on the cameras.
Must be something wrong
with the system. Damn it!
We're a little busy right now.
I'll call you back.
Don't yank me around, convict.
Get the cane, get out!
Yahtzee.
Officer: (Through loudspeaker)
<i>Victor zsasz, we've got</i>
<i>you surrounded.</i>
Please!
Please, don't hurt me.
<i>Let the girl go</i>
<i>before it gets ugly.</i>
The zombie is mine to liberate.
I have righteous work to do.
I'm not in the mood tonight,
zsasz.
<i>You seem troubled tonight, sir.</i>
It's harley, Alfred.
She was acting odd.
<i>Odder than usual, you mean.</i>
Like she was happy
to get caught.
<i>Maybe she missed her puddin'?</i>
Maybe.
More likely it's linked
to the joker's bomb.
Arkham had a yellow
alert this evening.
<i>Everything looks to be in place.</i>
Hmm.
That's mochel.
He doesn't work Friday's.
Neither does ferrick.
That's the Thursday crew.
This isn't live.
They're broadcasting
old footage.
Something's wrong at arkham!
(Engine revving)
No! No!
Enough, shark, put him down!
Ow!
Ouch!
Do I have your attention now?
Don't break cover in
the middle of an operation,
unless I say so.
Don't ever do that to me.
Or what?
You'll chew my head off?
Do it! I'm begging you.
You think any of you have
a shot of getting out alive
without me?
That's what I thought.
We're just lucky
this was contained.
Start following orders,
all of you!
Why don't you just
calm down, puddin'?
Don't call me puddin'!
Property room's down here.
Locked!
Not for long.
Now that's just pathetic!
The warden uses his birthday
backwards for practically all
of his passwords.
How do you know that?
I used to work here.
Didn't I mention that!
Come on, as what?
As a psychiatrist, silly.
And, pal, anyone who
throws boomerangs,
has some real issues letting go.
<i>Voila!</i>
Killer frost: Where do
we even begin?
Everyone take a section.
Just start looking!
Bloody hell!
(Exclaims)
(Laughs)
My acid playing cards!
I knew I left them here.
Here's that Batman
costume Mr. j used
for the train heist.
Oh!
I've been looking
all over for this.
Here's where it went.
(Giggling)
Bingo!
Firefly. Killer moth.
Maxie Zeus.
Never heard of any
of these tools.
Mr. freeze's gun!
Score!
Thanks.
(Grunting)
It's Batman!
Uh-oh!
(Both grunting)
(Harley cackkling)
Oh.
Ah!
(Screaming)
(Metal creaking)
(Gasps)
Aah!
(Groans)
No way!
The spoils of war.
Black spider just
kicked the bat's ass?
Mate, I'm a little choked up.
Got the thumb drive.
What?
What the hell?
We've been played.
Where's frosty?
Frost? Damn it!
Frost!
(Humming)
(Snorts)
Right. Easy.
I knew waller would
send someone.
I'm too clever for her
to let me live.
Nothing gets past you, genius.
I'll make this fast.
Do you even know why
you're assassinating me?
The wall says you screwed
her and to make an example
out of you.
And that satiated
your curiosity?
I don't ask questions.
I don't believe that.
The human mind always
has questions.
My only question is why
waller didn't just blow your
head off with your nano bomb?
It's the same reason
she needs me dead.
Because I know how
to diffuse them.
Wait, what?
How do you know she's
with the riddler?
She was eyeballing him
back at the monitor room.
So she's got herself a new guy.
After everything I've
done for her!
Oh, we'll see about that.
I'll make five more
just like her.
I'll take her skin and put
someone else in it.
Oh, that perfect creamy skin.
Pull yourself together, man!
She mocks you right
to your face.
Even dared to call you...
Puddin'.
Oh, that darling girl.
She might even deserve me.
Okay, babies!
Let's cook!
Winner, winner, chicken dinner!
Oh, harley, I take back
half the horrible things
I've done to you.
They're gone!
Yeah, we can see that
harley, but where?
It's waller.
-Deadshot: <i> I'm here.</i>
-What are you trying to pull,
deadshot?
You're not checking in!
We had a bout with the bat!
But we're past it.
I got your cane, waller.
We're just looking for an exit.
So you're all together?
Of course, why wouldn't we be?
Then why has the special
crimes unit been called in to
protect the medical center?
Deadshot: <i> Maybe two-face</i>
<i>got a pair of hemorrhoids.</i>
<i>We're out of here.</i>
Please don't explode!
Please don't explode!
Please don't explode!
Shut up!
Where's that medical center?
We're still on yellow alert.
You hear something?
Ah, let me check.
-Guard: Hey, remember that
time when mad hatter...
-(Thud)
Smitty?
Smitty!
Boo!
Aah!
Smitty!
Put your hands in the air!
And boom!
(Groaning)
(Coughing)
(Whistling)
I'm just going to slip into
something more comfortable.
So no peeking.
(Over loudspeaker) <i> This is</i>
<i>the special crimes unit.</i>
<i>Surrender and return</i>
<i>to your cells.</i>
Light 'em up!
That worked well.
Then like the hanged man,
we are at the end of our rope.
Wow, I hate you!
You can thank us later, losers!
You all right?
Somewhat.
Glad you made it.
This better be good!
He knows how to turn
off the bombs.
Look familiar?
I can do it, but you got
to get me into
the medical center.
We got maybe five
minutes before waller
figures out what's what.
We get to that room
or we're dead!
Should have brought a tank.
We have one.
No heights!
You're joking?
I said no heights!
I'll guide you. Trust me.
I'm crazy, but that's just nuts!
Step on it!
Go to the right!
(All groaning)
Aah!
Let's move!
(Groans)
Did we win?
(Groaning)
Let's see now,
we'll need this on.
This for back up.
Grab a chair.
Whee!
How do you diffuse
this bomb, exactly?
It's the electroshock.
It's the what, now?
I'm going to run 1000 volts
through your heads
and fry your bombs.
Oh!
(Sirens wailing in distance)
Good, put the chairs
in a circle here,
around old spark.
Oh, I love electroshock!
It's a shiatsu massage
for your brain.
Lose those.
I'll keep a look out.
More cops.
Choppers too.
This will work?
Or give you a grand mal seizure.
I'm clamping you to
the chairs because
you're going to wiggle.
I don't trust this fruit loop.
Mmm, 1000 volts, 5 bodies
multiplied by 5,
allowing for absorption,
three second pulses.
You know what
you're doing, right?
- (Machine beeping)
- Damn it!
Don't stop working.
Yeah, waller.
I'm getting reports that
there's a break in at arkham.
You're on red alert!
Deadshot: <i> News to me.</i>
What part of off-the-books
do you not understand?
<i>Are you in the medical center?</i>
We hit a snag.
Batman again?
Spider needed medical attention.
Spider? But he's...
No excuses lawton, you get that!
Uh-huh.
No more crap!
No more time!
No more shenanigans!
Uh-huh.
(All screaming)
Ah!
Those scum bags are
trying to screw me.
(Panting)
(Groaning)
(Humming)
I never need to do that again.
(Harley panting)
Are you kidding?
I feel great!
Nobody screws the wall!
Uh, guys!
Do it again!
I don't know,
maybe the skin
is too thick?
Best gun ever!
Boy, why'd his head explode?
Because the bomb in his neck
didn't diffuse, you asshole!
So what's his excuse?
Oh. Oh, that's rich!
Huh?
(Gasps)
Denzel, what have
they done to you?
(Cackling)
Haven't you solved it yet?
The black spider is Batman!
Aah!
(All screaming)
(Screaming through earpiece)
I know that sound.
Someone's flossing their brain.
Talk!
Why are you here?
Amanda waller wanted
the riddler dead.
Waller? What's she got to...
(Gunshots)
I'm here, bitches!
And I've brought favors
for everybody.
(Joker laughing)
Yahtzee!
(Whistling)
I think this was
yours, deadhead.
Finders keepers.
Puddin', you're free!
Don't you "puddin'" me!
I go away and suddenly
you've got new friends.
Even picked a new guy!
You got it all wrong, baby.
I was using them
to help you escape!
Who else would
I break into arkham for?
Nobody, that's who.
It'll be just like old times.
Oh!
(Both sigh)
Hmm.
You! New guy.
I don't like people
touching my stuff.
Go ahead!
You're out of bullets!
I am not!
You are!
You're going the pull
the trigger and when
nothing happens,
I'm going to punch
you in the throat
and bash your brains out!
Three.
Two.
One.
Hold on, stop counting
for a second.
I know there are bullets.
See!
Mate, you just
out-crazied the joker!
(Indistinct chatter on radio)
Killer frost: This place
is crawling with cops!
I'm going to kill waller!
Can we get out of here first?
Harley: Whoa!
Oh.
Mallet!
Its right here, Mr. j.
I was keeping it safe
for you the whole... ow!
It's time for a very big bang.
(Panting)
Why the hell are we running?
We're sitting ducks here.
And whose fault is that,
do you suppose, leader?
I've been carrying this team
all night, you douche bag!
- Ah, fellas!
- Captain boomerang: Really?
-Is that what
you'd call it, eh?
-Killer frost: Guys.
-Guys, listen...
-Yeah, yeah that's what I call
it, you one-gimmick hack.
Great, let's split up.
I'm better off on my own.
Guys! Batman's here!
Joker, where did he go?
Don't owe you squat, bats!
Lawton,
we can settle our
business later.
Now, where's the joker?
He and harley took their
mallet and disappeared.
That's where he's
hidden the bomb.
<i>Simulus testing!</i>
<i>Simulus.</i>
<i>I know you can see me, bats.</i>
<i>Hope you brought protection.</i>
<i>'Cause I'm about to give</i>
<i>Gotham a terminal case</i>
<i>of tainted love</i>
<i>and it's really gonna burn.</i>
And just in case you're
thinking of stopping me,
I figured I'd invite some
friends to my big blow-out.
Stop! Please!
(Screaming)
I need to find joker
and stop that bomb.
Good luck with that, mate.
Got to get out of here.
Yeah, but what will
get us far enough
to escape that blast?
(Helicopter blades whirring)
Well, isn't that convenient.
(Shouting)
Ow!
Out of my way, loser.
(Officers screaming)
(Groans)
No!
(Killer frost screams)
Oh no you don't, lawton.
That's my ride!
(Struggling)
Only one of us is getting
out of here, and it ain't you!
(Screams)
I'll get you for this, lawton!
Get those gates closed!
Where's our backup?
Now that's what I call backup.
We've got it under control,
Batman, you can take...
And I'm talking to myself,
again.
Going my way, handsome?
Cute kid!
Hope she doesn't take being
an orphan too hard?
(Groans)
- (Console beeping)
- Huh?
Holy crap!
You know she's going
to kill us, right?
Where's the fricking gas pedal?
Uh-oh!
Sure he smacks me
around sometimes,
but you're the one
who's always hurting me!
Now I'm going to hurt you!
Stop me, if you've
heard this one.
Listen to me!
Harley, the bomb!
(Ticking)
For someone who's not Batman,
you've been a real
pain in my ass.
Deuces, new guy!
Have a seat, puddin'!
Bang!
(Joker laughing)
Batman: Waller!
You knew when you sent
your little suicide squad
into arkham,
they'd go off script.
Oh, it's just you.
When your bombs didn't
dice them, you figured
the scu would.
All that, just so you could
kill the riddler!
Let's just say, I break a lot
of eggs to make an omelet.
And because you're a messy cook,
the riddler was able to escape.
I got careless.
My men will get nigma next time.
There is no next time.
No?
We're the U.S. government!
Who's going to blow the
whistle on us, the convicts?
Who'd believe them?
You?
You're going to start a blog
and expose us?
I don't think so.
That's checkmate, Batman.
I'm warning you!
Enough!
Don't they need you back
in your squalid little city?
They never did find
the joker's body, did they?
Punk!
Mother...
Bang!
