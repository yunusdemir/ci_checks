That's the Second Kisarazu Artificial Island.
450,000 square meters in total area.
That and the artificial island
off the coast of Kawasaki...
are the key points of this project.
When it's done,
the project will be in its final stage.
Then we'll construct a 15 km long dike...
to connect both islands to each other
When the project is complete,
a dike that circumvents the metropolis is built.
It'll use tidal height differences
to drain the water from the area.
By lowering the sea level and reclamation,
in ten years it'll have created
45, 000 hectares of new land.
Enough to eliminate our land problems
for the rest of the century.
Babylon is an eternal paradise.
Project Babylon is to make Tokyo like Babylon.
This is the biggest project of the century.
Given the difficulty of the adjustments
facing the participants...
it might not have been completed
in this century.
But Labor systems made it possible.
The basic research was completed
in the late 80's.
But if it weren't for
the massive demand for this project...
it would never have developed this quickly.
As a matter of fact, we have
a total of 3600 Labors working here,
large and small.
That's about 45% of the Labors
working in the entire country.
A Labor is a machine that...
can do the work of ten men in less time...
and this ocean project is only practical
because of an intensive use of them.
An old fairytale is now coming true.
Mind you...
we're now getting things
like Labor-crimes...
which we couldn't have imagined either.
Ah, that's your specialty isn't it?
Oh, over there. At 5 o'clock.
It's 500m in length,
and 150m height from the waterline.
The platform handles maintenance
for all the Labors working on the project.
We call it the Ark
Tell me... why's it called the Ark?
How should I know?
Deactivating systems 1 to 5.
Display functioning normally...
See? It's working perfectly.
There don't seem to be any problems yet.
Come on!
There won't be any problems!
To begin with, we checked thoroughly
before we even brought it in here.
Was it Shige, from your place?
It's good to be careful, but he's too careful.
Anyway, there haven't been
any problems with them, right?
The guys from Hachiouji have been
pushing me to get the OK...
to roll out Unit <i>2</i>
and start production of the others.
I'll start it up with the backup this time...
Oh, wait.
Two people from Division <i>2</i>
are here to pick you up.
Division 2?
Great! Whaddya think Noa?
Wasn't it worth coming over?
I don't like this kid...
What?
You said you wanted to see it,
so I made all the excuses to get here.
And this's the thanks I get?
Sorry, it just slipped out...
Okay, let's call it a day.
Rogen
Officers Shinohara and lzumi reporting.
Here to pick up Chief Nagumo.
Well, that was pretty quick.
I didn't know you two were coming.
We hitched a ride on a civilian chopper
that happened to drop by SV2, Ma'am.
The maintenance squad's speed ferry
is on the way.
But if possible, while we wait for it...
I was wondering...
You're Goto's men alright.
I don't know how you sniffed it out...
but you can test it if you like.
Though, Officer lzumi doesn't seem to like it...
Looks like she heard us...
That's 'cause you didn't watch
what you were saying.
Now she'll have it in for you.
But what I said was true.
He looks a bit villainous.
That's a matter of opinion.
Once it's officially registered
it'll be called a Type-O...
the final version of the Type-98.
It's also the first designed
to be run entirely by HOS.
What's HOS?
You don't know a thing about software do you?
It's a system program that
makes Labors run more efficiently.
Oh, it's just the Operating System...
HOS is the revolutionary OS that...
Shinohara released two months ago.
Even when installed in a conventional
Labor it increases performance by 30%.
Hyper Operating System, "HOS".
Most Labors now have
their mainframes re-written to HOS.
But no matter how good the vehicle is,
it all comes down to the pilot's...
brains and guts!
Good!
Chief Nagumo of SV2, your ferry has arrived.
Please go to deck A-12.
What? It's here already?
Come on, let's go.
Wow! Just like a world for giants!
It's all Labor sized...
I'm gonna leave you two behind
if you don't hurry!
Okay...
Chief Nagumo, may I ask you a question?
If it's about this place,
I doubt I know any more than you...
No, it's about the Type-O...
Why is it here?
You know that three of them were issued...
to the New York police as an experiment...
You mean that crazy story about
Kanuka becoming chief of...
the first Labor unit over there?
Shige, who went over there
to give technical assistance...
phoned me and asked...
if we could have it checked inside and out...
by someone from SV2.
Well, here we have access to
Shinohara's Labor facilities...
and we're close to the second command station.
It's the perfect place to keep it secret.
Is there a problem then?
Certainly not.
If there was,
it would've caused big trouble already.
It's just that it was Shige who asked,
so I couldn't ignore it.
Extension of the training period?
But I had your word that
we'd have everybody back this week!
Yes, but the situation has changed.
Division 1's training on the Type-O
is being extended for another week.
I demand a complete explanation.
Division <i>2</i> have problems to begin with.
If we have to work them even harder,
there's no telling
what kind of disaster we could have.
And I'm sure if we brought back Division 1 now,
they'd do just fine.
Nagumo, this decision came from
the main department.
There's nothing I can do.
Then I'll report to
the main department myself...
and I will personally ask the Guard
Division Chief to return Division 1.
Wait!
I'll tell you what I think.
Please keep this a secret.
In the early morning,
the day before yesterday...
the JSDF 7th Sector's prototype heavy Labor...
suddenly ran away during a wind tunnel test.
It escaped from the base,
and it actually took the paratroop Labor unit...
to stop it.
They don't know what
caused the prototype to run away...
and it was so heavily damaged that
examinations haven't helped.
They must've been really panicked
to have trashed it...
But what does that have to do with this?
The Labor in question was built
by Shinohara Heavy Industries...
and it had the same OS as the Type-O.
Everyone is keeping it a secret...
but there was nobody in the Labor
when it lost control.
You get the picture?
This could become a real problem.
We'll have to practice self-restraint,
as of right now.
You're joking, right?
Seriously?
Darn it. I hope this'll be over soon.
That's a rotten attitude!
Until Division 1 comes back...
we're the only ones
who can protect this city from criminals!
And who's gonna protect our human rights?
We don't have any!!
Shocking, isn't it, Shinshi?
Yeah... I've only been home
three times this month.
It's a certified marriage crisis.
You shouldn't have gotten married, you idiot!
It is because you were stationed
in the middle of the reclaimed lands...
But hey, aren't we getting more
dispatches these days?
Call from sector 7, 205 at Shitoya, Taitoh Ward!
Division <i>2</i> report to the site!
Repeat, 205 at Shimoya, Taitoh Ward...
As soon as you said it. Damn...
Let's go!
Roll out the trailer!
Hurry up with that revolver cannon!
I'll personally murder any slow-pokes,
so move it!
A dangerous Labor is out of control
and moving this way!
Please evacuate the area!
Run!!
Didn't you hear me? I said run!
Oh, here it comes!!
This is Sakura Fubuki 12.
To SV2, Division 2.
The target's a Yotsubishi Labor,
Tyrant 2000.
From a construction site on Kokusai Street.
It's moving at 4km an hour
and destroying civilian buildings.
Shinohara, keep going along the river;
try to get ahead of the Labor.
Yes, sir!
Unit 2, start up immediately
and pursue the target.
Roger! Beginning start-up.
Ohta, remember!
Think of the driver's safety first!
You know what I mean!!
Shut up!
Believe in my judgment at the scene!
You should tell him straight:
"Don't use the gun!"
Raise him...
The Yotsuboshi Tyrant is
one of those heavy classes.
Although it's slow, it has a lot of power.
Be careful.
I don't like it...
He went that way!
That bastard crushed my squad car!
Make him pay!
Leave it to me!
You idiot! I hope you drop dead!
Somebody! Help me!
You! Driving the Labor!
This is the SV2, Division 2!
Hang on, I'm here to rescue you!
Division 2? I'm dead!
What the...
I was being nice to you,
just because you're a tax payer!
You bastard!
This is Sakura Fubuki 12,
observing for Chief Goto.
102 is pummeling the runaway Labor
in the middle of a residential area.
But it seems to be having no effect.
Oh, now it's kicking...
then a dropkick!
Can't you do something about him?
Target and Unit <i>2</i> closing in.
It's coming, Noa!
Hey, do something about the driver!
This thing's too strong!
Ohta! Use the Stun Stick!
Hit the S-RAM unit in the left chest area;
Finish it with one blow!
Take that!
Done! Let's go grab some lunch.
What?
What the hell!?
Ohta, don't!
All trailers, prepare to move out.
Go to hell!
Mission complete.
Target has been completely destroyed,
damage to surrounding area extensive.
Alright! Alright!
Give it a careful washing, then dry it!
Don't forget to check the electronics.
Okay-
And where's the twit
who dropped the Labor into the river?!
He's taking a bath out back.
Okay, tell him to report to me when he's done.
Yes sir.
Reactivated?
You mean to tell me that
a deactivated Labor started up again...
without a driver?
It's impossible.
I couldn't believe it myself,
even though I saw it with my own eyes.
And that idiot filled it with so many holes...
there's nothing left to examine.
Could you have made a mistake?
You guys are tired,
you've had a lot of dispatches...
What caused the original problem?
What did the driver have to say?
The usual sort of thing.
It just started-up all of
a sudden during work...
This is the cause of this disaster.
But don't you think it's kind of unnatural?
Nothing like this ever happened
up to last month.
We have <i>22</i> cases so far this month.
We are likely to go mad, like those Labors..
What do we do with this report?
What do we do? Do you think
our boss would accept this?
As far as they're concerned,
Program malfunctions
couldn't cause this kind of accident.
Both the main department and
the manufacturers agree on that.
We'll just have to settle for driver error.
But they can't go after the pilots
and the blacklisted team members...
only with their testimony.
Noa!
What is it?
I'm not giving you any!
This is my last bag!
Can you dig out
the dispatch records for this month...
and copies of the reports?
What do you want those for?
Just do it.
<i>HEY. Pops“</i>
Can I use the Fridge?
The computer room?
- Alright. Go ahead.
- Thank you!
You're so good at using people.
This isn't any of your business is it?
What's it got to do with the Type-O?
Chief! There's a call for you
from Matsui of the Investigation Bureau!
Fine! I'll take it in my office.
What have you started?
You wanna know?
Yes. Shige Shiba from
Tokyo City Police.
Special Vehicle, Section 2.
Absent?
Oh yeah, Kanuka Clancy. Yes...
Are you still at it?
Is that you Noa? Don't stay in here,
you might catch a cold.
Go get some sleep. You never know
when you'll get a dispatch.
Right... You too, Asuma.
Wow!
They're smaller than usual.
I wasn't able to give them
all the attention they needed.
You're good at this, Hiromi.
Everyone'll be so pleased.
Well then, lzumi, please pick some.
We aren't sending them to market,
so just take the red, ripe ones.
Okay...
By the way, where's Asuma?
I thought he said he'd help, too.
He said he was on his way to the chief's office.
Looked like he'd pulled an all-nighter.
It may have something to do with that...
Hey, why don't we go share these with the chief?
Taking into consideration
each Labor's manufacturer,
condition of the Labors,
the background of each driver,
and everything related to these cases.
I've found only one common factor
among the runaways.
All of them, regardless of manufacturer,
have a Shinohara HOS mainframe.
But 80% of registered Labors carry HOS...
Maybe, but it was in 100% of the runaways.
And another thing;
the increase in runaway cases
began two months ago...
coinciding with the date HOS was released.
It can't be a coincidence.
"HOS" has some fatal defect.
I think we should submit this data
to the department chiefs...
and press Shinohara to release the HOS program!
Chief?!
HOS is a revolutionary OS,
and it has monopolized the field.
If there should be any defect,
it would ruin Shinohara.
Besides, the officials who approve
Labor OS's aren't total fools either.
If there was any defect in HOS,
it should have been detected
during de-bug.
- But...
- Listen.
Let's say there is some relationship
between the runaways and HOS.
But what if "HOS" isn't defective?
I mean, what if the runaways
aren't caused by some bug...
but something intentionally programmed?
Would you read this for us?
This's the first report from Matsui.
Report on Hoba Eiichi...
You mean Hoba Eiichi, the programmer?
Hoba Eiichi, the ace of Shinohara's
software development division.
He's the genius who
single-handedly developed HOS.
Estimated age: 30.
Returned from MIT in '97...
and was immediately hired
by Shinohara Heavy Industries.
Address unknown. Profile unknown.
Criminal record unknown.
Approximately 170cm.
Physical character,
including major illnesses unknown...
How can this be?
Not only Shinohara's personnel computer,
but school, city hall...
and all of his personal records
have been erased.
He's far past the point of suspicion...
Then it's a piece of cake.
Just bust him and bring him in for questioning.
- We can't.
- Can't? Why?
He was sent to the Shinohara line at the Ark...
Five days ago, he jumped into the sea.
His body was never found.
We certainly started a bit late on this.
Just when we started sniffing around HOS...
If we'd only done something earlier...
Oh, well. Bug... program...
Either way it looks like HOS is the culprit.
Now we have to figure out
the big picture, and how Hoba fits in.
We'll leave the investigation of
Hoba to Matsui, and Shinohara...
Why are you making a face?
Then you knew it was HOS all along.
Boy, do I look like a fool, working all night...
We still don't know what triggers the runaway.
I want you to continue with your analysis.
<i>“</i> Okay?
<i>'</i> YES!
Oh, and this matter should just be
between those of us in this room.
Why's that?
Don't you remember? last month,
we got an order from above.
Shige installed HOS in the Type 98's.
If there's a relation between HOS
and the runaways...
then the 98's are also at risk.
Despite that, if there's a dispatch order,
we have to go.
Revealing this information
would only serve to worry the men.
- I'm going over to Hachioji.
- Pops...
I've got things I wanna check.
I'm not gonna interfere with your investigation.
I'd like to go too, Chief! Please, can I?
I probably don't have to tell you this, but...
I'll behave myself!!!
- Wha'cha doing? Move it!
- All right!
- Are you sure about this?
- They'll be back by tonight.
If we get a dispatch order,
I'll take over the command car.
I don't get it.
He's trying to prove that Shinohara
Industries is involved in this case.
You make him do it.
It's so ironic.
The father's the president of
a major Labor manufacturer...
and the son's in the police Labor unit.
On top of that they're constantly fighting,
like cats and dogs.
But it's up to Shinohara to make the decision.
I don't like forcing people to do anything.
Line 3 and 4, finished.
Main hoist A-F, stand by.
Now that production for
project Babylon is done for awhile...
we're concentrating on export.
We just recently increased production
on this line by 20%.
I see.
You know, even though I see this view
every day, I still feel like I'm dreaming.
Fifty years ago,
we started a small parts factory...
for the occupational force.
Then we grew from vehicle parts
to machine manufacturing.
We started on industrial robot development...
the year Asuma was born.
And now the monsters called Labors
are flowing down the line.
But I'm lost...
I studied a lot, but fifth generation
computer or system engineering...
I just can't handle them.
As a mechanic... I really feel lonely...
I'm just about the same.
Everybody called me a "Vehicle God'.
But when it comes to software
I'm basically a beginner...
There's no way I can compete with
Shige or any of the younger guys...
But Sakaki...
There's no point in fossil engineers
sitting around comforting each other.
It's truth.
No matter how technology develops,
there's one thing that holds true.
As long as the human side,
those who make the machines...
those who maintain the machines,
and those who handle the machines...
don't do anything bad,
the machines won't play foul.
But Jitsuyama, I didn't come here
as the SV2 maintenance squad leader...
meeting the manager of
Shinohara Industries' Hachiouji factory.
I came to speak openly,
as men who spend more time
with machines than with their wives.
Your company's HOS, is it safe?
What are you talking about?
This company's future depends on HOS.
It's been well received everywhere.
As a matter of fact,
Project Babylon's construction time
has been reduced by 30%.
That's not what I'm asking.
How is it?
It's safe. You have my guarantee.
Okay, got the copy is finished.
The master copy of HOS...
E. Hoba...
Jehovah?
It's spreading rapidly!
I don't know the exact rate!
What? We can't do that!
Just do it! Shut down
the main computer!
Did you forget we're connected to
the computers at other factories, too?!
That little twit!
Did that surprise me or what?
Did you leave anything behind that
they could trace back to you?
No way.
But the only people who know
the room's lock's combination...
me and Jitsuyama...
so they'll figure it out sooner or later.
Guess we can't go back there for a while...
But we did get the data we needed.
If something that risky is in the master copy...
then even Shinohara Industries
hasn't broken the protection on HOS.
We have eight thousand Labors lurking
around Tokyo with a suspicious OS...
and God only knows what's in it.
It's bad news alright...
and sooner or later some of
the sharper folks'll start to notice.
Eventually Noa will find out too.
We'd better deal with this quickly.
Yes, sir!
We can see that again...
Oh? We saw it from every room...
but that's pretty common in today's Tokyo...
must be a coincidence.
I still don't get this Hoba guy.
I mean Labor related jobs
have really high salaries, right?
So why did he choose
all these battered apartments;
26 of them in two years?
Don't you think it might be the best way
to keep from being traced?
Buildings about to be demolished...
to make way for redevelopment
are just as good as battered ones.
No neighbors to be interrogated.
If he was that cautious,
then Why'd he leave behind
a change-of-address at city hall?
He've already broken into the computers
of his company and university...
and erased all of his personal data.
As if he were showing off, eh?
Hey, Officers. You through yet?
Oh, thank-you. Sorry about that.
Maybe he wanted to...
show us something.
Show us what? What for?
To find that out, I guess
I'll have to follow our man Hoba's trail.
Matsui, are you sure
we can screw around like this?
The chief won't say anything for a while.
That's the way things always work.
That's what I don't understand!
Us, in the Crime Investigation Division,
working at the request of the Guard Division!
That man, Goto, what is he?
"Razor" Goto.
He's notorious at headquarters.
Then how come...
he's stuck out
in the middle of the reclaimed land?
Cause he was too sharp.
Let's go.
Wait!
This shows the geographical
distribution of the runaways.
They're pretty concentrated alright.
Riverside Redevelopment...
Shinjuku Sub downtown Development...
Ariake Harbor City...
But Shinohara, these areas
always have many Labors.
I thought so too.
This is the distribution of Labors in Tokyo.
I see. Interesting.
There are other areas of concentration...
but the incidents only occurred
in these limited areas.
So there's something in those areas
that triggers the runaways.
But what is it?
I've been inputting anything
and everything that comes to mind...
and searching for a common factor,
but the conditions are vague...
It's just no good...
I wish Shige was here...
Shinohara, why don't you take a break?
You didn't get any sleep again last night.
I can't.
We don't know when our own
Type 98's might start doing something...
Look, just go out and get some fresh air!
Yesterday's dream is today's hope,
and tomorrow's reality.
Making a step towards...
the realization of a fulfilled tomorrow.
Project Babylon.
A challenge for the 21st century!
- Sorry to keep you waiting!
- All right!
One each!
Hey, Asuma.
Why don't you have one?
Oh. A tomato?
Come on. You look like
you need the most vitamins.
Why couldn't you get something gutsier...
What's wrong? I washed them.
Noa... did you...
Come with me!
What is it?
Just come! Say I've got a date with you!
- Wait!
- Come on!
What the hell's this about?
- Drop dead!
- That asshole!
Did you actually get permission to leave?
The chief said get some fresh air!
That's close enough, right?
But we're both still in uniform,
riding double on a scooter, without helmets...
and I still think it's too risky.
Don't worry about it!
I already checked the patrol schedules
for the squad cars.
I'm not talking about that!
What?
I said I'm not talking about that!
Then what are you talking about?
Dammit! Just forget it!
Okay!
Thank you for waiting.
20 inch slop pizza, ethnic style.
Great...
Are you sure about this?
Looks like we're attracting attention.
Relax. Just act natural
and there won't be any problem.
Right. Cheers!
But really, Why'd you suddenly
decide to treat me?
Well, you see...
- By the way, Noa...
- Yes?
How's Alphonse been doing lately?
He's doing great, of course...
Why do you ask?
Just wanted to know...
Alphonse is always doing great...
Sakaki and everyone in the maintenance squad...
take good care of him...
He's been a good boy, and...
and he's doing just great!
He's not gonna run away!
You did hear us, after all...
Tell me...
Alphonse won't run away, right?
I don't know.
I still don't know what triggers the runaway...
The only man who did know is dead...
and we haven't figured it out yet.
Then we can just rewrite the OS!
If HOS isn't online anymore...
Rewriting the OS would have
to be done at the manufacturer...
and to do that we'd have to
fill out the paperwork.
Unless we come up with some proof of what...
causes the runaways,
the brass'll never approve it.
But if we leave them like this
and Alphonse runs away, then...
he'll be destroyed, right?
Like the Labors Ohta and I destroyed...
Noa, just give me a little more time.
I'll find the solution.
"Forward and backup are two-in-one."
"The pilot shall follow
the order of command."
Come on...
Let's eat. It's gonna get cold.
Look, just like Alphonse.
Alphonse 1, the dog I had when I was little.
Oh? Then the present one is the second?
Nope, number 3. The second was a cat.
Hunh? What's he doing?
He must've heard something.
Dogs can hear some sounds that humans can't.
The wind must be whistling somewhere...
Wind whistling...
What's wrong? You look funny...
Wind...
Sound“.
Sounds inaudible to humans...
Noa, I've got to borrow this!
There's something I have to check out, fast!
Borrow? Then how am I
supposed to get back?
And when you get back,
tell the chief to wait for my phone call!
See ya!
Wait! Idiot!
I hate you!
I couldn't get hold of my old man.
The main office wouldn't tell me anything...
and when I phoned home,
they said he hasn't been back for a while.
He's a busy man.
Sorry the place is a mess...
my daughter and her children came over.
Your grandchildren?
I guess beer is out if you're still on duty...
I'll make you some coffee.
Before you do that,
I want to know what sound frequency
triggers the Labor runaways.
The Sumitomo Building at Shinjuku Sub downtown.
The Twin Building at Riverside Park 21.
Both are high rises with a structure
that acts like a giant whistle...
when the wind blows.
The Ariake harp bridge
that connects Daiba and Chiba...
its wire should vibrate,
also making a whistle...
inaudible sounds to humans,
but quite audible
to a Labor's sensitive receptors.
That's what triggered all these recent runaways.
Labor work places are concentrated
in areas of the city...
or in construction sites
where such sounds are easily produced.
Hoba was quite a genius,
choosing low frequency sounds...
to trigger the runaway.
It's no coincidence that he joined Shinohara,
which was behind in the field.
My old man was trying to go up...
against the major corporations
and if possible, monopolize the market...
so he was easily
hooked by HOS - the bait.
Now, we know that how dangerous
that innovation really is.
Just like he wanted,
Labor OS is now dominated by HOS...
and that's what's gonna kill
Shinohara Industries.
That's why I can't reach him.
He realized what HOS is
and he's running all over town.
Asuma, if that's made public now,
Shinohara will be...
Jitsuyama!
If it isn't me, sooner or later
somebody'll reach the same conclusions.
I want you to make
an announcement about the matter.
You don't want to turn
Labors into villains, do you?
"Labor"
Asuma!
Hey, I'm back!
Asuma!
Rejoice Noa!
Your noble sacrifice has been rewarded!
Asuma! Asuma!
Officer Asuma Shinohara.
You're being suspended for two weeks.
I assume you know the reasons.
No, I don't!
I'll spell it out for you: Leaving base
without permission while on standby.
Nearly using blackmail to elicit testimony,
by invading an ordinary citizen's home.
Unauthorized use of a private computer.
Riding double with a colleague,
and without a helmet.
Drinking and driving,
as well as other various traffic violations.
And more to come!
You should be punished
for such a violation of the regulations.
But this is not the time,
and since Chief Goto
strongly petitioned your case...
we'll quietly settle this matter.
You should be grateful to him,
since he's willing to sacrifice himself...
to save his men.
That's all.
I have a question! What's happened to
the Shinohara Heavy Industries case?
That isn't really any of your concern...
but if we just left it at that,
you'd be a wreck.
Generally this is not something
an officer would have anything to do with.
Late last night, the president of
Shinohara Industries filed a report to...
the Ministry of Trade and Industry,
stating that HOS has a major flaw.
Taking the matter quite seriously...
the cabinet held an emergency
meeting early this morning.
They accepted Shinohara's case...
and settled on rewriting HOS
back to conventional OS.
To prevent any unnecessary panic
this process will be carried out...
and described as a rewrite to
a new version of HOS, free of charge.
You're kidding! What about
Shinohara Industries' responsibility!
I'm being punished, and he's getting away!
Isn't it fairer to punish both sides in a fight?
What the hell do you think police are for?
Police investigations aren't used to
support family feuds!
Well, how about that.
You guys knew the truth and were...
dealing under the table the whole time!
He must have figured that it's better to
have admitted the fault himself...
than to have it pointed out by someone else.
The government's more concerned about...
the public turning against Labors
than about Shinohara's responsibility...
Project Babylon is involved,
and if that sinks, so will they.
So they stay silent about Shinohara.
They keep it quiet and cover it up.
That's about it.
Don't get depressed, you did a great job...
We may have all had the data,
but you reached the conclusion by yourself.
Though that last move wasn't so good.
But how did the captain
find out about the scooter ride?
Oh, that? I forced lzumi to spit it out,
and then I informed him.
Chief!
You're tired aren't you?
Well, now you can stop working
and concentrate on the investigation.
Investigation...
Are you still thinking of continuing that?
You're so pessimistic for your age.
Even Shinohara itself doesn't have
a complete grasp on the matter.
If the solution was as simple as a rewrite...
Hoba wouldn't have killed himself so early on.
Don't you agree?
Then... you still believe in
the "Hoba's intentional crime" hypothesis.
What do you think, Shinohara?
I think so too...
Asuma!
He's back!
Shige!
Hello!
What's that costume?
I could ask you the same thing.
What're you doing in street clothes?
Well, this and that happened
and I got suspended for two weeks.
If you'd talked to us beforehand
that may not have happened.
It's the price you pay for
not thinking about teamwork.
Oh? Which button do I have to push
to make you say "teamwork"?
What?
Please, calm down, both of you...
try to honor my safe return...
Oh, Shige, please fill out the form
for program re-writing.
Right! Sorry to put you to work
as soon you get back, but could you?
- Do a rewrite?
- Yeah!
- For the 98?
- Of the OS!
What's the problem?
We can't have HOS aboard!
It's the reason I was killing myself
working... and got suspended...
I never did the rewrite to HOS.
What?! But we got
the order from headquarters...
So, I just pretended to rewrite.
I threw in a dummy activation display...
and sent back the diskette.
Inside is the same old OS.
You didn't have any problems, did you?
I sure was glad when I got the news
over there that HOS was a chancy thing.
But it's all thanks to Sakaki's training.
Even if it was good,
I didn't feel like putting in
some suspicious new HOS.
If anything happened
I'd take full responsibility.
So off I went, secret in my heart.
Well, it sure was a success!
But nobody ever heard about it?
Funny... I told Goto when he called me
international long-distance...
You told the Chief?
In other words,
he knew that if he didn't tell you..
You'd work hard enough to kill yourself.
He's at it again...
Now I know how Noa was feeling earlier...
He's been playing me like a puppet...
That middle-aged weasel...
Poor Asuma...
A curse on him!
"1-3 Eiichi Hoba"
Matsui.
It's in English...
He... heavens... came down...
"He bound the heavens also, and came down,
and darkness was under his feet"
It's one of the psalms in the Old Testament.
It must've been written there by Hoba himself.
But I still can't believe you found
the house where he was born.
It was nothing.
All I did was trace address changes
and that's where I ended up.
But that's it, I can't go any
further... dead end.
That area of town was deserted during the 80s...
when there was
that sharp increase in land prices.
After the National Land Act,
it was forgotten,
like an abandoned land floating in the universe.
But how strange this city is...
As I traced his path,
I started to feel as though...
time were leaving me behind...
What you think of as a familiar sight...
starts to rot away here and there...
you look away for a moment
and when you turn back it's gone.
Gone before you even know what it meant.
In this town, the past is a worthless thing...
The place where we're talking now...
was sea until a little while ago.
And in a few years there'll be
a huge city in front of us.
And then, someday,
that will become the worthless past.
It's like a continual bad joke.
That's probably what Hoba was trying to say...
"Where do we go? What are we?"
What's that?
An inscription which was left on a wall...
by a Viking captain in ancient Europe.
You are a loser! Snap it harder!
- Well...
-Sorry about all this...
Before you go... What's your opinion?
He's it, Goto, no mistake.
But if he's a goner,
then I guess there's not much more
an inspector can do...
Well, I owe you for this one.
I'll make it up to you some day...
A tomato patch, a chicken house,
and the maintenance crews are all out fishing...
do they really call themselves police?
Not police...
More like defenders of justice.
Tell me, do you think
I'm still over-analyzing?
What?
I can't say really...
but I am grateful that the defect was found...
before we actually got the Type O.
I asked Kanuka to do research...
on Hoba's stay at MIT.
While he was there he was called Jehovah.
Jehovah?
That's what they call God in the Old Testament.
It sounds a lot like his real name,
and he was probably smart enough to earn it.
Well, actually there's
a follow-up story to that.
The proper pronunciation is
"Yah-weh" or "Yah-ha-weh".
"Je-ho-va" is an incorrect one that
spread by accident.
When he found that out he was insanely happy.
You know, Shinobu,
I'm starting to feel I understand
the way this Hoba guy thinks.
Looking at those high-rises...
day after day,
wondering what kind of crime...
people committed
"And the Lord came down..."
"to see the city and the tower
which the children of men built."
"Go to, let us go down,"
"and there confound their language,"
"that they may not understand
one another's speech."
"Therefore is the name of it called Babel."
Well, it could be coincidence...
Do you think it's a coincidence that
he chose the Ark...
as the place to kill himself?
If this plan centers on a code
based on the Bible...
there's no way he's going to
pass over a target like Project Babylon.
"Babylon has fallen, has fallen!"
"All the images of its gods
lie shattered on the ground!"
There's more to come.
These are clues left by Hoba himself.
Another example.
He made it a point to leave messages.
All 23 of the places Hoba lived in...
overlap with the three Labor
runaway zones that Asuma pointed out.
Matsui was really puzzled.
He said it was as though Hoba was
asking us to solve the mystery.
A challenge?
He's not that sort of romantic.
He wasn't going up against the police at all.
He had great confidence in his program...
or else he wouldn't have died
before seeing the result.
When he jumped off,
he was probably laughing at us...
No, everybody who lives in this city...
You know,
you look so happy when you talk about Hoba.
That's dangerous... Really?
Anyway, if it's that big a plot,
are you sure those two can handle it?
I think they'll be okay...
I'm sleepy... hungry and worn out.
Okay, input is complete...
Here we go...
Okay... what's the parameter
for the simulation program?
Well, if 10.21 Hz is the right number,
then this is correct...
That's all the damage there'd be?
I feel like I'm dealing blind.
I don't get it...
I know it couldn't end with this little...
What data could be missing?
That inaccessible file in HOS...
If that could be taken apart,
we could prove Goto's theory about Hoba's crime.
Then we could spend
more resources and personnel...
Then it's a Trojan Horse program?
Probably...
That rewrite must've worsened the contamination,
spread it even further...
Such a stupid decision...
Shige! You have a guest!
Yes?
I've brought provisions! How's it going?
It just proved how powerless we are...
That's it? Here, I got a newspaper
Thanks. Let's see how
our international affairs are doing...
Compared to "God",
I feel like a computer-loving little kid...
Noa, could you get me some coffee?
Sounds good.
I only have instant; sorry.
Sure thing.
- Noa, turn on the gas again!
- Huh?
Just do it!
What's this all about?
So what?
- What the...
- The resonance!
There was no point in simulating
the components individually...
if objects vibrate at the same fixed frequency,
they reinforce each other's vibrations!
Not much of a difference.
The low frequency that
initiates the first resonance is too weak.
It has to kick off with something more powerful!
Blow-through structure buildings,
the harp bridge...
iron pipes in construction sites,
air ducts for underground facilities...
There's gotta be something else...
Let's see...
it should be located in some
big open space with no outer walls...
say some multi-level structure...
How could something like that
exist in crowded Tokyo...
The Ark?
How could we have been so blind?
I forgot that I made a copy
at the Hachiouji factory...
Put the Ark into
the wind tunnel simulation programme...
raise the wind speed parameter to infinity...
Hang on! This computer doesn't have
the processing capacity.
Okay, we've got it online!
The data's not coming back, is it?
Here it is!
Wow...
What's the lowest wind velocity
that can set off the reaction?
40 m/second?
You only get that sort of wind
when a Typhoon hits...
Typhoon no 19, is now at
the south west tip of Kei Peninsula...
heading north east at a speed of 25 kph.
It will hit Tokyo early tomorrow morning.
The typhoon's air pressure is 950 bar...
and within 20 km of its center
wind speeds are over 40 m/second...
That's it! We've heard enough!
This is all just a theory!
And I heard that this simulation
was programmed by...
a suspended officer and the maintenance crew.
Do you really expect us to take it seriously?
According to the Meteorological Agency...
Typhoon #19 will strike the city
early the next morning.
We don't have time for
additional testing of the program.
You say it's only an unproven theory...
but it's a fact that we have
no evidence to deny it either.
When the Typhoon reaches Tokyo,
its winds will cause the Ark to vibrate...
That will stimulate the low-frequency...
howling of the numerous high-rises
which will itself induce the whirring
of the buildings in downtown Tokyo.
And 8000 Labors situated all over
the metropolis will become runaways...
What will result need not be mentioned.
Labors aren't just located in
the redevelopments in the city center,
but also in the Geo-front construction
site 100 meters underground.
Also Labors are operating
inside some nuclear reactors.
If the simulation results become reality...
I'd like to know...
who would take responsibility...
and how, for not preventing
the crime beforehand.
Please tell me!
Goto.
The city-wide OS rewrite
has been completed.
Even if Eiichi Hoba's crime existed,
it is now quite irrelevant, don't you think?
HOS is still being analyzed
with the assistance of MIT...
but it's true nature
has not yet been determined.
The experts agree that it may still be...
hiding in the Labors' memories...
in that case it is reasonable
to assume that any Labors...
that came in contact with HOS
are still contaminated.
Wait for the Typhoon to hit?
Chop down the high-rises?
Dismantle all 8000 Labors?
Or...
You have only four choices.
Your decision please.
From early tomorrow
until the typhoon has passed...
activation of all Labors within city limits
will be prohibited.
Labor production lines
and repair facilities will be shut down.
We will request aid from the fire
department and the defense ministry...
as well as neighboring prefectures.
That is all.
Chief, there's a possibility that
deactivated Labors...
may start up by themselves due to
the effects of the low frequency noise.
Did you forget about the episode
with the JSDF prototype Labor...
Goto!
What was that?
I never received such a report.
Then I have one more question.
Will you knock it off?
If it's caused by a Typhoon,
I don't really see how
anyone should be held responsible...
I mean it's done by a Typhoon...
Of course.
If it's an act of God, it can't be helped...
Chief!
Assistant Inspector Goto,
returning to the station.
What did he mean?
As he said, it can't be helped
if it's an act of God.
Afterwards, if Hoba's crime can be proven, fine.
If not, let it go as the Typhoon's fault.
If the cat gets let out of the bag,
the Captain'll take the fall.
The old snake.
Poor Captain...
We're the poor ones.
If Hoba's crime can't be proved,
we'll be criminals.
Want out?
No. If I'm gonna regret it anyway,
better something done than left undone.
No turning back now.
I won't be back for awhile.
Follow Shinobu's orders until then.
Roger!
What's gonna happen?
We're gonna destroy the Ark!
After insulating the memory bank
and the cockpit,
get on with the water-proofing.
We don't have much time!
Boss! The floats are here!
Okay, let group 3 handle it!
As the crews finish their current jobs
I'll send them down!
I got the okay! Bring out the riot gun too!
We got the experimental explosive
shells, right? Load them into cartridges!
What? But that's too risky...
Do it!
Typhoon #19 is continuing on course.
It is still heading north east,
and will hit the Kanto area in...
Yes! The storm is coming!
We'll have to purge the platforms
with the emergency fire systems after all...
Then the occupation of
the control center is the key...
Give me the file on the security robots...
Labors are set up...
Attaching the floats to the trailers'll be
done in a couple hours...
By the way, how did you get hold of
that monster anti-Labor rifle?
I begged for one from
the paratroop unit in Kasumigaura.
When I mentioned the prototype Labor incident...
they rented me one immediately.
I'm going over to Narita airport now.
We may have to fight every Labor on the Ark,
so I called in a secret weapon...
Yes, I mean HER.
- Sight seeing?
- No.
Combat.
Let the air in!
There's nothing more for me to say.
The Ark should be totally empty
after the evacuation order...
so fight as much as you like!
Are you sure?
You can still call them back!
What if the operation is successful...
but you still can't prove Hoba's crime?
Then we're criminals.
But if we don't do anything,
and there's a disaster?
Then we're criminals again.
Which do you prefer?
And besides, there was no choice to begin with.
If they fail, the bay area will be devastated.
We can't predict how much damage
will actually be...
If they succeed,
then project Babylon will be crippled
by the loss of the Ark.
Either way we lose.
Probably the real fight ended
when Hoba jumped.
Don't you agree?
And you still want to do this?
You really don't have
the right character to be in the police...
I really feel sorry that you always
end up getting the short end of the stick.
Where are you going?
We did get silent approval from headquarters...
but if they raise hell on the Ark...
the Maritime Safety Agency and
the Harbors Bureau won't keep quiet.
I'll go over there and buy some time.
This's a job for the chief.
- Goto...
- Yes?
No, nothing...
Then, please take care of
the rescue arrangements.
There it is! 500 meters ahead! The Ark!
Doesn't the atmosphere feel Evil?
Just like a shrine of Idols.
An appropriate grave for a man
who assumed the name of the Lord.
Listen, as long as they don't get too close,
guard robots aren't much of a concern.
But there's far too many of them,
so avoid combat as much as possible!
We only need the control center.
Ohta, take the point!
Noa, bring up the rear!
We'll run all the way!
Charge!
Come on you worthless hunks of junk!
I'll rip you apart!
Five to the rear...
Eight... They keep coming!
Go!
Wait up!
Move it!
I told you to avoid combat!
We did, as much as possible.
Quick response based on the situation!
The situation is changing all the time!
At any rate, conserve ammo!
We don't know what's up there!
Roger!
There it is!
Move it!
He's so rough...
If we don't hurry this place
is gonna be flooded with security robots!
Start up the emergency routines!
That'll shut off the security automatically!
Okay, here we go...
This will sounded the alarm back on land.
Well then let's see
if we'll be dangerous criminals
or heroes by the time...
when the Maritime Safety people get here.
We have until the weather clears.
Can you hear me?
I've deactivated the security systems.
Roger! Will stand guard!
Okay, let's take this thing apart!
- Wait!
- What?
A Person!
There's somebody in sub control
on the top level!
What?
It's no mistake. See? It's moving...
- It can't be...
- But he's supposed to be dead,
Hoba's ghost?!
Or some sort of trap. Can you get me
into communication with the sub control?
Can't. The sub control isn't in use...
It has to be powered up from there.
Someone has to go up and check...
But the time! The Typhoon's about to hit!
Noa! Listen up!
- What is it?
- We've got a problem.
There's a possibility that someone's
still here, in the top floor sub control.
A file cross-check says it's Eiichi Hoba.
It's a trap for sure!
But somebody's still up there.
Noa, will you go?
Why Me?
It's too dangerous without a Labor...
and delicate decision-making
might be needed.
Ohta can't handle it!
What?
Go! I'll support you from here...
Forward and backup
are two-in-one, right?
And one more thing!
We don't have much time,
so we'll proceed with the original plan
at the same time!
What?
I heard HOS's true nature was confirmed.
Oh, Chief Nagumo...
Yeah, we got a call from MIT...
saying that they'd finally dissected the file.
- So what's the verdict?
- We hit the jackpot.
A virus was planted in HOS.
It invades the backup memory to start off...
then it changes its name and
gets into every available space possible.
There's no doubt that any computer...
that comes in contact with HOS
will be contaminated.
By morning there's gonna be
one hell of a mess...
MIT has already started programming a vaccine,
but I wonder if it'll do the trick...
If only we'd known this half a day earlier,
they wouldn't have had to go by themselves...
We can't even send in reinforcements...
But this did prove Goto's theory...
At least now we can arrange the rescue.
Wait a sec!
You said HOS or any computers
that came in contact with it, right?
What about the Ark's main computer?
They're using it for the purge!!
D level, block 5, 30 seconds until purge.
All personnel working in
this block evacuate immediately.
D-5 block is purged.
Alphonse is moving from D-6 to D-7.
Get ready for the next one.
Code for D-7?
FPD-00207.
Why can't we wait until
she goes up to the next level,
and then drop the entire floor?
If the Ark loses too much weight at once,
it'll become dangerously unstable.
It's ok. If we drop the open blocks first,
it should eliminate
much of the resonance effect.
What's it like outside?
Wind velocity 35... now it's up to 36!
D-7, here we go!
D level, block <i>7</i> is purged.
Next! Code for E-2!
As... Asuma! Look!
Blocks 3,5 and <i>7</i> of D level,
and all of C level!
They're flooded with runaway Labors!
What? But the wind
isn't over 40m per second yet!
Either the simulation overlooked something...
or the purging has worsened the effect!
Come on, you scrapheaps!
I'll waste all of you!
Hiromi! What's going on?
Runaway Labors are piling up
at the other end of the bridge.
Ohta charged in just now.
What about Kanuka?
She left. She said
she was gonna look for a weapon.
What do we do?
Could it be that she's...
Boot okay. System normal.
Type-O stand by.
Kanuka, don't! The Type-O is too risky!
Don't worry, I'm using a system disk
where the virus has been isolated.
Assuming all goes well
I should be able to control it.
But what if the virus has hidden somewhere...
Then this Labor will be a threat
whether I use it or not!
Besides, Ohta won't be able to
hold them all off on his own.
I'm willing to take the gamble.
Clancy out!
Noa! Can you hear me?!
The situation is changed!
The runaways have started
earlier than estimated!
We don't have much time left,
so proceed at full speed! That's all!
Thanks for telling me...
Birds?
The wind velocity outside is now
over 40m per second!
We can't wait any longer!
Noa! Answer me! Noa!
The lD's around a raven's leg...
Just report your conclusions!
Is there anybody up there?!
No! Nobody's here!
It's not accepting any input...
The main computer was contaminated too?
Control room, please respond!
Runaway Labors are increasing!
There's so many of them...
I can't hold them off
if they start crossing the bridge!
Please hurry up with that purge!
There's gotta be something...
some way...
There should be
a backup manual ignition system...
something that blows away all the block
joints without the computer relay!
But how do we get to the ignition point
while we're stuck in this mess?!
Just deal with it!
The top level of the main shaft,
right under sub control...
Good thing the police stresses
the value of human life.
Bingo, and just in time!
It's right under Moe's feet!
Take that!
The Type-O?!
My God...
Ohta! Kanuka!
We're gonna start purging the entire floor!
Get back to the command center!
Ohta! Answer me!
30 seconds after ignition,
the entire floor should purge!
I don't know what'll happen when
the Ark loses that much weight at once!
Listen Noa, don't move away
from there after you ignite it, alright?!
Answer me Noa!
Roger!
Ignition!
Ignition confirmed!
Kanuka“.
Asuma!
Shinshi!
Kanuka!
Hiromi!
Ohta!
Somebody answer me!
Ohta...
Ow... Hell of an experience...
Noa, don't! Kanuka is aboard that thing!
Kanuka! Kanuka!
Answer me Kanuka!
Get out of your vehicle and run Noa!
There's no way you can
beat this thing in hand-to-hand combat!
But can't you stop it?!
What about the activation disk?!
I used it...
and reset the computer, but it's still moving!
Probably the virus entered the S-RAM
for pattern study,
and that must be adjusting the program!
Where's the S-RAM?!
Behind the neck,
same as in the Type-98!
Gotcha!
Noa! Run!
You can't win with a Type-98!
Noa!
Eat it!
STOP!
Noa!
I did it...
Yeah! We did it!
