Ohh! No!
Ohh! Ohh!
Ohh! No!
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!
Blood! Blood!
Are you stating, Counsel,
you're not gonna offer any
contradictory psychiatric testimony?
Yes, Your Honor.
On the basis of this staff report,
Norman Bates is judged
restored to sanity
and is ordered released forthwith.
What about his victims?
Don't they have any say?
Can you restore them?
Madam, please sit down.
This matter is being represented
by the district attorney.
Your Honor,
my name is Mrs. Lila Loomis.
I have a petition here
signed by 743 people
against Norman Bates' release,
including the relatives
of the seven people he murdered.
Doesn't that give me the right
to speak out?
Has the district attorney
advised Mrs. Loomis
about her rights in this matter?
Yes, Your Honor.
I explained that her petition
had no effect on these proceedings.
Have you explained to her
that this hearing
- is a matter of law and not a motion?
- Why are you people just sitting here?
Don't you realize they're gonna
release a homicidal maniac?
Mrs. Loomis,
I'm gonna ask you to sit down,
or I'll have the bailiff remove you
from this courtroom.
If you have any further questions,
please discuss them
with the district attorney
after this hearing.
Why bother?
It's all too obvious...
our courts protect the criminals,
not their victims.
She's got a good point.
Congratulations, Norman.
Turning now
to calendar number 71143.
Is that all there is to it?
That's all there is to it, all right.
Let's go.
Let the record reflect
the defendant is present with counsel.
Just like I said, they let him go.
I'll call you later.
Are you satisfied, Doctor?
Turning a murderer loose
on an innocent public?
Mrs. Loomis,
Norman was not convicted of murder.
He was found not guilty
by reason of insanity.
- And since he is no longer insane...
- That is just legal hocus-pocus.
...he has as much of a right
to his own life as you and I.
And when he murders again,
you will be directly responsible.
Well, this belongs to Mr. Toomey
who runs the motel.
Want me to find him?
I'll introduce you.
No, no. It'll... It'll wait.
What's the matter?
Uh, I saw someone.
Where?
In that window.
They haven't had a tenant
in the house for years.
I guess I'm just nervous.
Well, that's understandable
under the circumstances.
Yeah.
Well, this is it.
Yeah.
You don't have to stay here, you know.
I could find you a place in town.
No, no. I... I want to stay here.
Then, as long as you realize
that the memories
are more likely to reoccur here...
But you know how to handle that now,
don't you?
Sure.
You start work at noon today.
Don't forget.
No, I won't.
I don't suppose you will.
What's wrong?
Oh, nothing, really.
I just wish there hadn't been
all those cutbacks.
There'd be a trained social worker
to look in on you from time to time.
Well, I have you, don't I?
Damn right you do.
I had the phone reconnected.
Any trouble, use it.
Okay.
Thanks, Doctor, for everything.
Mother?
Norman.
Norman...
what did you put in my tea?
Gonna get you for this, Norman.
Gonna show you what happens
to bad little boys
who poison their mothers.
I'm going to kill you!
Can I help you?
I'm Norman. Norman Bates.
The new cook's helper.
Oh, yes. Dr. What's-His-Name
called about you.
Raymond.
I'm the one who urged Mr. Statler
to give you the job.
I think it's very Christian
to forgive and forget, don't you?
- I sure do.
- So do I.
Myrna, this is Norman Bates.
That's Myrna, Norman.
Come on, I'll introduce you
to Mr. Statler.
He's in the back.
Ralph, this is Norman Bates.
Yeah, okay, Scott,
but you have to tell me why.
Just give me...
Ralph, this is Norman Bates,
your new helper.
Hi. Get him an apron,
will you, Mrs. Spool?
Scott, we have to talk about it
sometime!
Step on it, would you, girl?
You're being paid to wait on tables,
not gab on the phone.
Look, I'll call you back later.
We'll talk then, okay?
- Okay, bye.
- We're getting ready for rush hour.
He's really very nice
once he catches his breath.
Hey, Queen for a Day,
want to try being a waitress?
Mary, this is Norman.
He's gonna be working back here.
Hi.
Boyfriend troubles.
Poor child.
Heart of gold but head of wood.
Let's get that apron for you, shall we?
Here you go.
Jesus Christ, girl,
what have you broken this time?
It wasn't her fault, Mr. Statler.
It was me. I... I did it.
Well, let her pick up,
and you get back here
before you do any more damage.
Thanks.
Here. Bates.
Here, put these up there
under the hot lights
and read the orders off.
On the wheel.
On the wheel.
Oh.
Uh, two meatloaf sandwiches
and one mashed potato with gravy.
And one baked potato.
Okay, go ahead, go ahead, do it.
See if I care.
No, no. Scott?
I didn't mean it.
Listen to me.
Hello?
Bastard.
- You all right?
- 'Course I'm all right!
- Where you going?
- Into town.
Now, will you please leave me alone?
If you're going into town,
you're heading in the wrong direction.
Look, I... I don't know
what happened,
but, uh, why don't you let me
call you a cab?
Why?
Why?
So you can get home safely.
I don't have a home.
No home?
I've been living with my boyfriend
for over a year,
and all of a sudden,
he tells me we're through.
And then I just phoned him
to ask him why,
and he wouldn't tell me.
All he'd say is that I couldn't
come back to our apartment.
Well, what are you... What...
What are you gonna do?
Call a friend in town, I guess.
See if somebody will let me
crash with them for the night.
What about your parents?
Uh, couldn't you stay with them?
They're in Portland.
And they don't care
what happens to me, anyway.
Well, I own a motel
not too far from here,
and you'd be welcome
to spend the night
in one of the empty rooms
if you'd like.
F.O.C. Of course.
- What?
- Free of charge.
Oh.
But, no, that's very nice of you,
but I don't want to impose.
You wouldn't be imposing.
Coworkers ought to
help each other out, don't you think?
Is that why you covered for me today
when I broke that pie plate?
Yeah.
I figured you'd get into more trouble
for it than I would.
You're not kidding.
I've been working there four days,
and I've broken a dozen dishes
already.
You sure it's all right
if I stay at your motel?
Oh, absolutely.
Come on, let's get going.
It looks like rain.
Well, we almost made it.
You didn't get too wet, did you?
- No, I'm all right.
- Oh.
Do you own all this?
Oh, yeah.
Well, it isn't much,
but I'll get it fixed up eventually.
Well, let me get you a room key.
Mr. Toomey?
Why don't you wait here
while I check the room?
Uh, just to make sure
the linen's fresh.
Well, you thinking
about stealing something?
There's no reason to be scared,
sweetheart.
I manage this dump.
What do you want, a room?
Norman's already getting me one,
thank you.
You're with Bates?
Well, uh, you must be Norman Bates.
I'm Warren Toomey.
Mary, why don't you go up
to the house?
The... The front door is open.
Is something wrong with the room?
No. Just... Just... Just...
Just go up and wait for me, okay?
- Look, it doesn't matter...
- Look, just do as I say, okay?
She's pretty cute.
Where'd you find her?
What's this stuff?
I'd say it was drugs.
What about the occupied cabins?
Is that what's going on in there, too?
Yeah.
Boy, this town.
If it isn't the parents, it's the kids.
I caught a couple of 'em
screwin' in the basement
of your house up there last week.
'Course, I threw 'em right out.
Can you believe that?
What kind of a motel
are you running here?
The kind that makes money.
People come here to party.
They stay a few hours,
and then they leave.
What more are you gonna ask
from a motel
so far from the beaten track, huh?
You're fired.
Hey, you can't fire me.
I was hired by the hospital board.
The state has no claim on me
or my property anymore,
and neither do you.
I want you out of here tomorrow.
Yeah, well, why don't you try
putting me out, Mr. Wacko, hmm?
I'd like to see that.
I won't have to.
I'll just go to the police.
I'm sure they'd be very interested
in what's been going on here,
especially the drugs.
Tomorrow, Mr. Toomey.
And don't rent out any more rooms
in this motel. No more.
At least my customers
have a good time.
What'd yours get, Bates, huh?
Dead! That's what they got!
Dead!
Murdered by you, you loony!
Hi.
What was all the yelling about?
Oh.
My motel manager and I
just had a fight.
Wasn't because of me, was it?
No.
Why are you sitting in the dark?
I was just thinking about scott.
Maybe if I hadn't blown up at him
so quick,
we would've worked things out.
Yeah, maybe. I... I don't know.
Is that... better?
Do you think I should call him
and talk to him again?
Oh, sure.
Hi, Scott?
Are you all right?
What were you talking about?
Listen, I didn't mean it.
Are you still mad at me?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm... I'm at this motel.
No, I didn't get wet.
I got here just as the storm started.
Look, I can take care of myself.
No, of course not.
I said I'd be all right.
Okay!
Look, I can't talk any longer.
I got to go.
Oh.
How did it go?
Terrible. I found out why he
didn't want me to come home tonight.
Oh. Well, why?
He's got somebody new.
He's moved her in already.
Well, that's no good.
Oh, well.
Think how it would've been
if I'd married him
and then found out
what sort of guy he was.
He asked me to, you know?
Sure.
I mean, I'm sure he did.
- Oh, have... have you had dinner yet?
- No.
Well, let... let's have it together.
I was just about to sit down.
It's just, uh, sandwiches and milk,
but you're more than welcome
to share it.
- I really don't feel like...
- No, no. Do... Do it. Do it.
Do it for my sake.
Starving yourself isn't gonna
make anything any better, either.
All right.
But this is yours.
No, go ahead. You... You have it.
I'll make myself another.
Do you have a knife?
No, I'm afraid I don't.
I... I just moved back here
after being many years away,
and I forgot to bring any cutlery.
That's odd.
People usually leave something,
even if it is only an old butter knife.
Oh, there.
Something wrong, Norman?
Um...
Aren't you going to eat?
No. I... I just suddenly lost my appetite,
but you... you go ahead.
Enjoy it.
I guess I'm like you.
I... I suddenly lost my appetite, too.
Oh, would you like something else?
- There's cookies for dessert.
- Oh, no, no, thank you.
Uh, can I use your phone again?
Sure.
Who you gonna call?
Um, I just remembered this girlfriend
I have in town.
I... I mean, she's kind of a girlfriend,
and, uh, maybe she'd let me
spend the night with her.
Well, I thought
you were gonna stay here.
There's a spare room upstairs,
and you're more than welcome to it.
Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.
Why?
I don't mean to hurt your feelings
or anything,
but... Myrna was talking about you
at the diner today.
Mrs. Spool kept on telling her
to shush, but she wouldn't.
She said you'd been locked up.
Did she say why?
Well, I'll tell you.
When I was 12,
my mother went mad,
so I... put some poison in her tea.
You know?
I'm... I'm all right now.
You sure?
Sure.
Otherwise they wouldn't have
given me a job
in a diner, would they?
I don't know.
It takes a nut to work there.
Boy...
Look, I'm... I'm sorry,
but I don't want to...
What if I told you
that I needed you to stay?
Why would you need me?
Because this is the first night
I've spent in this house in years,
much less alone.
Lot of my troubles
had to do with this house.
So, you see, I'm as scared as you are,
just for different reasons.
- I'm sorry, but I...
- Please.
That bad, huh?
No.
Not... Not... Not that one, no.
This one over there.
What's wrong with this one?
Well, that, uh...
used to belong to my mother.
But she's dead, isn't she?
Yeah.
Is this the room
where you had your troubles?
One of 'em, yeah.
Well, I don't know what happened
to you in the past, Norman,
but you're never gonna get over it,
not unless you face it.
See? No ghosts.
No.
- I could sleep here.
- No, I'd, uh...
Why not?
I'd just rather you didn't.
What happened in here
that scared you so?
Let me show you the room
across the hall, okay?
You'll be, uh... just fine in here.
Oh, the, uh...
The bathroom?
Is right over there.
Uh, well,
I guess it's time to, uh,
to go to sleep.
Okay.
Good night, Mary.
- About time, girl.
- Sorry.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Sorry I missed you this morning.
I got up early and went into town
to see my girlfriend.
You know,
the one I was telling you about.
- Guess what.
- What?
We're going to room together.
Well, you're more than welcome
to stay with me, you know.
Thanks, but I'd really rather live
in town.
Oh, in town, yeah.
My... my place is a lot closer to work.
No, I... I really don't think
that's a good idea.
Okay.
Well, if you change your mind.
Hey, girl, I gave you the morning off,
not the afternoon.
Hop to it.
Charming, isn't he?
Chop up some more lettuce,
will you, Norman?
Hey, Ralph.
So, uh, how's your new helper doin'?
Hi, Warren.
Just fine, thanks.
Yeah.
Well, I hope he washes dishes
better than he runs a motel.
Oh, incidentally, could I have
the salad dressing on the side?
Hey, can I get a little service
around here or what, huh?
- Okay.
- Hey, cutie! Come here.
Oh, hello.
Uh, what would you like?
I'd like some of what
Norman got last night.
Pardon?
You heard me, sweetheart.
Why don't you look at a menu
and I'll be right back?
What happened between you
and that man last night?
I fired him.
Oh, great.
He's on my station.
What did he say?
Nothing nice,
and I think he's been drinking.
He sure smells like it.
Hey, you do have other tables,
honey,
or do you want me
to wait on those, too?
Talk about the customers
being nasty.
- Excuse me, do you still work here?
- Yeah.
Then, could I please have my orders?
Oh.
So, what's it like?
What's what like?
Screwin' a psycho.
Would you mind removing your foot?
Next.
Two turkey sandwiches
on whole-wheat toast,
one BLT, hold the mayo.
I'll get the tomatoes, Mr. Statler.
Hey, I suppose
you didn't spend last night
alone with him in that house, huh?
You got strange taste in men, honey.
Just because two people sleep
under the same roof
doesn't necessarily mean
they've made love.
Since when, huh?
Or are you the kind
that doesn't, uh, kiss and tell?
You really want to know
what Norman's like?
Yeah.
Better than you'll ever be, fat boy.
Cut it out, Toomey!
Norman?
- Are you talkin' to me, wacko?
- Come on.
Come on.
Come on! Huh?
- Johnny, please, let's go.
- What's wrong?
Oh. Oh, that's... that's beautiful.
Go on, psycho, pick it up.
Come on, pick it up!
What's the matter,
you lose your nerve, huh?
Or do you only attack women, huh?
Go on! Pick it up!
Show us what you're really like.
Come... Come on, loony!
Ah, look! Not only is he crazy,
he's chickenshit, too!
What's the trouble, Warren?
The trouble is that psycho you hired.
This is the last time I eat here.
You're sweating all over.
Can I get you something?
A glass of water, maybe?
No.
What the hell did you do out there?
That man, Mr. Toomey,
he was trying...
I'm not talkin' to you, girl.
Well?
He was bothering Mary,
and then he slipped me a note.
What note?
It's there on the wheel.
There's nothing here.
Look, Norman, you're tired.
Why don't you take
the rest of the afternoon off?
I'm telling you, it was right there.
Sure it was.
Don't humor me.
I'm telling you
there was a note on that wheel
from my dead mother.
Okay, everybody,
business as usual.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Is that offer to room with you
still open?
Oh, sure!
Great.
Well, what... what happened?
Oh.
You know my girlfriend,
the one I told you about?
- Yeah.
- Well...
her boyfriend sleeps over
almost every night.
Do you know what it's like
trying to sleep
in a one-room apartment
when a couple's making love
five feet from you?
Noisy?
You're not kidding.
Well, I thought
you were wonderful today.
Why?
The way you handled
that Toomey guy?
What an asshole.
I could've killed him,
and you were so cool.
No, I don't kill people anymore,
remember?
Oh, here.
- What's this?
- Fudge.
My grandmother sent it to me.
She makes great fudge.
Well, thank you.
What about that note?
You figure out who sent it?
That was just a... practical joke.
Yeah, I guess so.
Oh, oh, oh, let me take that.
No, no, no, that's all right.
I can manage.
Oh.
Did you...
Did you have dinner yet?
Yes, and I'm exhausted.
I'm going to bed
right after I take a shower.
If that's all right with you.
Oh, oh, sure.
Hey, wake up!
Hey, you nut guys! Hey!
Hey!
Psycho!
Hey! Hello, psycho!
I just want you to know
I'm moving out! Huh?
Hello?
Wha... What?
Who is this?
My mother is dead.
Mr. Toomey, if this is you,
you're sicker than I ever was.
Bastard.
Bill!
Hi, Bill.
I wasn't expecting you till tomorrow.
Hi, Norman.
I got a call from Mr. Statler.
He said you quit your job
at the diner.
Yeah. Well, I just figured I could
make more money with the motel.
You know, once I get the...
once I get it back into condition,
that is.
What does Mr. Toomey think
about your plans?
Him?
You know, I fired him.
You know, he was turning this place
into what I think they call
an adult motel.
I see.
Well... been an awful lot of changes
in the week you've been back.
Yeah, yeah.
Any more notes or phone calls?
No. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Mnh-mnh.
Who's that?
- Where?
- There, in the top window.
The attic?
It looked like a woman.
Oh, oh, oh,
that must have been Mary.
Mary who?
Oh, Mary.
She works with me at the diner.
She's been staying here, too.
Oh?
Oh, it's nothing like that.
We're just, uh, we're just friends.
Mary.
Hi, Mary.
You look great.
Look, this is, uh,
this is Dr. Raymond.
He was my psychiatrist
in the institution.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Well, what do you think?
- About what?
- What Norman's doing.
Has he told you his plans
for the place?
Some of them.
Well, I have to be going to work.
Can I give you a lift?
Go ahead.
See you tonight.
So, what can I do for you, Doctor?
Oh, thank you.
Are you familiar
with the Norman Bates case?
Very.
I was deputy here
when sheriff Chambers arrested him
years ago.
I reread the file
when I found out he'd been released.
So, what's the trouble?
Bates dressing up
as his mother again?
No, nothing like that.
Although, Norman says that somebody
has been leaving notes
and making phone calls
claiming to be his mother.
Well, people.
So, what do you want me to do
about it?
- Put a tap on his phone.
- Sorry, Doc, I can't do that.
This is Fairvale, California,
not Washington, D.C.
But I can check around
and see who might hate Norman
enough to do something like that.
Anything else?
You could keep an eye on Norman.
I have been.
All right, Sheriff...
here's my card
in case you should need me.
Oh, there is one other thing.
Yeah, of course. What?
He's got a girl living with him.
Uh, Mary Samuels.
She works at the diner.
Then, I'll check on her, too.
Thank you, Sheriff.
Any time.
Slut?
Are you sure this is safe?
It always has been.
Come on.
Hey.
Oh, I don't need any more.
What was that?
What?
That sound in the next room.
You're just stoned.
I'm not.
Jesus.
What is it?
Shh.
Let's get out of here.
Shh.
Come on. Hurry!
Josh.
Look out behind you!
Norman?
Mary! Up here.
What are you doing up here?
I... I was locked in.
You couldn't have been.
There's no key in the lock.
Someone unlocked it...
while I was asleep.
Who?
Whoever's been pretending to be
my mother!
Norman, what are you talking about?
I saw her in the window.
And just look in the room.
It's all been fixed up,
and her stuff's inside.
There's another note, too.
I'm gonna check the back stairs.
Maybe they went down that way.
Norman?
What?
There's no note in there.
What do you mean it's not there?
No, thi...
This isn't how it was.
It... It was all fixed up.
It wasn't like this.
The... The note.
This... The dresses are...
Who's that?
Norman, you better answer the door.
Yeah.
Norman?
Whatever you do,
don't tell 'em about the bedroom.
- Hello, Norman.
- Hello.
I'm sheriff Hunt.
How are you?
This is Deputy Pool.
Can we come in?
Yes. Yes.
Uh, this is...
I know. Mary Samuels.
Well, what... what can we do for you?
There hasn't been any trouble,
has there?
Yes, there has.
What sort?
The old sort.
There's a girl sitting down
in my squad car below...
too scared
to come into this house.
Why?
Well, she claims
that she saw her boyfriend murdered
in your fruit cellar today
by a large woman dressed in black.
That's just how your mother
used to look, isn't it, Norman?
Well, what... what were they doing
in the cellar, anyway?
Oh, what kids do today, I guess...
smokin' dope, messin' around.
Do you know anything about that,
Norman?
No.
You mind if we look
in the fruit cellar?
No.
Looks clean to me.
Yeah, doesn't it, though?
You been straightening up down here?
No, sir.
This is the first time
I've been inside this room
since I came home.
- Then, who did it?
- I did.
Several days ago.
Hey, Norman?
I just hate a dirty house, don't you?
Why is this open?
I don't know.
Better put a padlock on it
before someone robs you blind.
How much has he told you
about himself?
Enough.
You know why Norman
doesn't come down here, don't you?
No, I don't.
He used to keep his mother's corpse
down here.
Stole it from the grave.
Talked to himself in her voice,
answering in his own.
What do you think of that?
Horrible.
That's right, it was.
Now, let me ask you again.
Are you positive
you cleaned up down here?
Yes.
All right.
- Mike?
- Yeah?
Let's go.
Are you sure that neither one of you
heard anything this afternoon
between 4:00 and 5:00?
No, but I was...
He was with me all afternoon.
We were walking in the fields.
Good-bye.
Nice to see you again, Norman.
Why did you do that?
Do what?
Lie to the sheriff.
You weren't with me this afternoon.
I had to do something.
He was going to arrest you.
Norman?
It's starting again.
- Sheriff Hunt?
- Yes?
I... I'm Lila Loomis.
I used to be Lila Crane.
Oh, yes, of course.
Well, what a coincidence.
I was just thinkin' about you and sam.
How is he?
My husband is dead.
I'm sorry.
Well, what brings you back to Fairvale
after all these years?
Norman Bates.
Where is he?
He's out at his motel, I suppose.
Why haven't you arrested him?
- What for?
- For murder.
It's all over town
what he did to that boy.
Mrs. Loomis, I can't arrest a man
without proof,
especially one with an alibi.
What alibi?
There's a girl
staying out there with him,
and she says that he was with her
at the time the murder took place
if there was a murder.
Oh, well, what do you mean
"if there was a murder"?
Well, what I mean
is that I am not convinced
that anybody was killed.
There's no body.
No corpus delicti.
So let's just wait and see
if the boy comes home tonight.
Have you dragged the swamp yet?
What?
The swamp.
That's where he dumped his victims
the last time.
Have you dragged it yet?
No, ma'am.
Well, then, I suggest you start,
before there are more murders.
Unless, of course,
you want it on your conscience.
What's her problem?
I don't know.
But if Norman Bates is crazy,
there are a whole lot of people
around here
runnin' him a close second.
Are you sure you're all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
What you need
is one of my special Irish coffees.
Is there any brandy in the house?
I don't know.
My mother doesn't allow liquor.
Mr. Toomey was a drinker, wasn't he?
Did he leave a bottle in the office?
I don't know. I didn't look.
I'll be right back.
You rest here.
Hello?
Why did you lie to the sheriff
and say Bates was with you
this afternoon?
Mother!
What are you doing here?
Go back to the hotel
before you ruin everything.
Answer my question.
Why did you alibi Bates?
I didn't alibi him.
Don't lie to me.
I talked to the sheriff.
Why did you do it?
Because Norman
couldn't have murdered that boy.
Why not?
He saw me in the window
like we planned.
Then he went in to the room
and saw the stuff.
Then when he went looking for her,
I locked the attic door behind him.
He was trapped in there for hours
while I took everything
down the back stairs.
So, you see,
he couldn't have done it.
What difference does it make?
We want him recommitted.
This would have done it.
Mother, he's innocent.
Innocent?
He killed your aunt, didn't he?
Not to mention the six other people.
Mother, that was 22 years ago.
Mary, people don't change.
He must have gotten out somehow.
Mother, I was wrong.
I don't think he drilled that hole
in the bathroom wall.
Of course he did.
Mother, listen to me.
I think there's someone else
in the house.
Don't be stupid.
It's just Bates
up to his old tricks again.
It can't be Norman.
He isn't like that anymore.
Maybe if you knew him now...
It's just that he's trying so very hard
to do what's right
to keep his sanity.
And it hardly seems fair for us
to be doing what we're doing to him.
You're as crazy as he is.
We'll talk later.
Norman needs me.
Norman needs you?
A psychopath needs you?
Look, go back to your hotel.
We'll talk later.
He'll kill you.
You know that, don't you?
He'll murder you
just like he did all the others!
Mary!
My God, what happened?
I don't know.
Jesus.
How did that get in there?
After I killed that kid in the cellar,
I used it to clean up the mess,
and then...
then I flushed it down there.
You didn't kill anybody.
You were locked in the attic.
It wasn't locked.
You said so yourself.
Norman,
stop talking nonsense.
I tell you,
you didn't kill anybody.
Then, how do you explain this?
Well?!
I can't.
Did you clean up the cellar
the way you told the sheriff?
No.
Somebody did.
And with that towel
after they killed that kid.
Norman, it couldn't have been you.
How can you be so sure?
Even I don't know.
- I always used to black out when I...
- Because you couldn't.
You don't have it in you, not anymore.
Norman, look,
why don't you go downstairs
and make us a drink, okay?
And I'll clean this up.
Norman?
Yes?
Uh... the teakettle's boiling.
Oh.
Okay.
What happened?
Up there.
I saw someone staring at me.
There's no one there now.
Someone was watching me
through that hole.
They're in the house with us right now.
Where did you get that thing?
I... I had it in my purse.
My mother gave it to me when I was...
Oh.
Come on!
Uh... you take the downstairs,
I'll check up here.
Well, shouldn't we stick together?
Don't worry, I've got this.
It's because of me, isn't it?
That's why you have it.
Of course not.
Hurry up.
They'll get away.
Mrs. Lila Loomis, room 15, please.
You're sure she hasn't come back?
There'll be no message.
Thank you.
Okay, Mother, where are you?
Norman.
What is it?
It's my mother.
She's downstairs.
Did you see her?
You're sure you heard her?
Come on.
No.
She'll kill you.
I know she will.
Norman, your mother's dead.
You killed her.
You told me so yourself.
I was wrong.
She survived.
And now...
she's downstairs...
waiting for you.
Norman, it couldn't be your mother.
No.
No, it... it had to be someone else.
Whoever it is
that's trying to drive you crazy again.
Yeah?
Yes.
- So, let's go downstairs and find...
- No!
It's too dangerous.
Let's wait till morning.
What are we gonna do until then?
I'll protect you.
You'll be okay.
I'll... I'll be fine right here.
It was always safe here... at night.
- Norman, this is...
- No.
Okay.
Um... we'll spend the night
in here.
You can use the sleeping bag.
What are you doing, Norman?
Norman, put the knife down.
Nobody's gonna come in the door.
- They're not, huh?
- No.
Okay.
Mary.
Yes?
I'm becoming... confused again,
aren't I?
Of course not.
Don't lie to me.
Not you.
Yes, Norman,
you are becoming confused again.
Just...
don't let them take me back
to the institution.
All right?
Don't worry, Norman.
I won't.
You smell good.
- I do?
- Yeah.
What do I smell like?
You smell like...
like the toasted cheese sandwiches.
What?
That my mother used to bring me
when I was in bed with a temperature.
She used to do lots of nice things
for me before she went...
before she became...
Shh.
Just remember the good things
she did for you.
Only the good things.
I can't.
They're not there anymore.
Of course they're there.
No, the doctors took them all away.
Along with everything else.
Except...
Except those sandwiches.
Shh. Shh.
- Just sleep, Norman.
- Okay.
Just sleep.
- Oh, good morning, Doctor.
- Morning, Norman.
I called your office,
and they said you were on your way
over here.
Where's Mary?
She's gone into town.
Oh?
What for?
I don't know.
She didn't tell me.
Some tea?
Coffee if you have it.
Thank you.
Sure.
Norman...
do you remember Lila Loomis?
Yes.
She's staying in town.
She is?
She's Mary's mother.
That's why Mary went into town.
To see her.
Do you realize what this means,
Norman?
What?
They're the ones
who have been leaving the notes
and making the phone calls.
- Why would they do that?
- Because they hate you.
Mary? Mary doesn't hate me.
Come on, Norman.
Like mother like daughter.
You know how Lila Loomis feels
about you.
She can't wait to see you
re-institutionalized.
That's why all this
is happening to you.
They want to destabilize you,
undermine your sense of reality.
They can't do that.
Good.
Glad to hear you say that.
But...
It isn't them, anyway.
It isn't? Who is it?
It's my mother.
She's not... dead.
How do you know that?
I've seen her up in the window.
You saw her, too.
That was Mary Loomis or Lila Loomis
dressed up to look like your mother.
What about the phone calls?
Mary Loomis again.
But she's been with me
when the phone rang.
Then, it was her mother.
My mother spoke to me downstairs.
Norman...
Do you remember now
our discussions about your mother?
Once you accepted the fact
that you murdered her,
her memory would have no hold
over you.
Room 15, please.
I want you to stop calling Norman.
What are you doing here?
You heard me.
Stop calling Norman.
I haven't called him.
Don't lie to me!
You called him this morning!
For God's sake,
keep your voice down.
All right,
so what if I did call him?
He's slipping into insanity again.
I can hear it in his voice.
There's nothing anyone can do
about it, not even you.
You could stop stuffing bloody towels
down toilets
and peering through peepholes
in walls.
- That would be a help.
- What? What are you talking about?
About what you're doing to Norman.
You were in that house last night.
I was not.
I came right back here after I saw you.
Don't lie to me.
I'm not lying.
Then, why weren't you in your room
last night when I called?
What, did you have me paged?
I was probably down here.
Mother, stop lying to me, please.
What happened in that house
last night?
Good-bye, Mother.
Hey!
He's about to go over the edge,
isn't he?
Listen. Now, listen.
Just dress up in his mother's clothes
one more time.
That's all it's going to take.
I'll have the police and a doctor
out there
before you're in any danger.
Then, they'll have to act
on our petition.
Mother, I signed all your petitions.
I've been to all your meetings.
I've done everything you've asked me
for years.
But I am not going to hurt Norman
anymore.
Well, if you won't do it for me,
at least do it for your father.
I am not living for dead people
anymore, Mother.
Not for your sister or my father.
Not even for you.
- Now, I'm going.
- Now, wait a minute.
Mother, let go.
You're hurting me.
Now, you listen to me, young lady.
You're gonna see this through,
or I'm going to...
- Mom, don't.
- No.
You can't make me...
No, listen... Listen to me!
If you go near that house,
you're going to be sorry.
What year is that?
Yeah.
I don't see what all the rush was.
Well, the sheriff was concerned,
and he thought
we might bend the rules.
Put that down real easy.
- I don't like it.
- Here?
Supposed to have an order
from the coroner.
- I got this.
- Well, you're not supposed to like it.
Sheriff said do it, so we're doing it.
All right.
- Get that.
- I got it.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Hope we're not gonna be here long.
Now do you believe me?
Yes. She's dead.
And she's not coming back
to life again, is she?
Back to life?
No.
Shall we go?
Mary?
Back here!
I was just about to have some lunch.
You want some?
No.
Where have you been?
At the cemetery.
Dr. Raymond had them open up
my mother's coffin.
Oh?
Yeah, so...
that proves that she's not the one
who's been torturing me.
Not unless... she's a ghost.
No?
No. He says...
he says it's you and your mother.
He says your last name is Loomis.
Is that true, Mary?
I wonder who that could be.
I don't know.
Don't you?
Hello, Mrs. Loomis.
How are you this af?
I'm...
I'm sorry, Mother.
I didn't mean to insult you.
Norman, stop it.
This is not your mother.
Hello. Hello, Lila?
Lila, are you there?
There's no one on the line.
Hello?
Yes, Mother,
I'm sorry we were interrupted.
Norman, there's no one there.
Yes, Mother.
Hello?
Hello, Norman?
This is your mother.
It doesn't sound like her.
It is, Norman,
and I want you to hang up.
Do you understand?
Hang up.
All right.
Do it, Norman, now.
Hang up.
I was so worried.
About what?
Well, that all the things
that have been happening to me
were because of you
and your mother.
And when Dr. Raymond
showed me Mrs. Bates' corpse,
I knew she was dead for sure.
But now...
now I know it's somebody
completely different.
Who is it?
My real mother.
Who is your real mother, Norman?
I don't know.
She won't tell me.
Your mother is dead.
Mrs. Bates was your real mother,
and she's dead.
Then, who was that on the phone?
My mother.
Dr. Raymond was right
about both of us.
Lila and I were trying
to drive you crazy again.
But then I stopped.
Only, she won't,
and she's the one who's calling.
Well... why did you stop?
It wasn't fair for us to be doing
what we were doing to you.
Is that the only reason?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean.
Ma'am.
Norman, the sheriff would like
to see you out at the swamp.
- Hey, Sam?
- Yeah.
Scotch it is.
There you go.
All right, spread that line away.
We're gonna send the divers
down here in a minute.
Everybody, uh, stay clear...
We need more time to...
- Hello, Norman.
- Hi, Sheriff.
What's, uh, what's going on here?
You ever seen this before?
No. Did you...
Did you find it in the swamp?
Yes.
How about any of this stuff?
Well, thi... this is Mr. Toomey's.
Who?
Norman's motel manager...
before he fired him, that is.
You seen him since?
No, I told him to get packing,
and he left.
That's all I know.
You sure?
Yeah.
Well, that's about it, then.
You can leave.
Just you, Norman,
not the young lady.
Okay, but... but shouldn't I wait?
Don't worry.
I'll have her along presently.
Aw, forget the marker.
Get on in there.
Sheriff, I've been wanting
to talk to you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Someone has been phoning Norman
claiming to be his mother.
And not the dead Mrs. Bates.
His real mother.
So?
So, I've been wondering if it's possible
that he was adopted?
Not that I've ever heard of,
and I've lived my entire life here,
Ms. Loomis.
How did you find out who I was?
We're a tad slow around here,
young lady, but not incompetent.
Now I've got a question for you.
Either you or your mother
know anything about this?
No.
Then, I don't see any point
in either of you stayin' around Fairvale
any longer, do you?
Have we broken some law?
None that are on the books,
but a whole hell of a lot of them
that aren't.
Like all the ones
having to do with right or wrong.
I'd say you and your mother
have just about broken
every one of those, wouldn't you?
I didn't mean to.
Now, that's what Norman said
20 years ago.
Only he was crazy.
Now, what's your excuse?
I guess I don't have one.
Well, I'll just say good-bye
to you now, then.
Expect it to be for the last time.
Sheriff.
I said good-bye, Miss Loomis.
Hey, Sheriff.
There's a car down here.
Anybody in it?
I can't tell.
It's stuck in the mud.
Well, get a winch line down to it
and get it out of there.
All right, they found a car.
Doctor.
What are you doing here?
I followed Lila Loomis
from her hotel to your house.
She came down here.
Oh.
Where is she?
I don't know.
But she was here.
It proves she was the one
that was dressing up as your mother.
How?
Well, if she wasn't gonna do it again,
why would she sneak into your house?
But she wasn't the woman
I saw in the window.
She wasn't?
- No.
- Then, who was?
That was my mother.
Norman, your mother is dead.
Remember the open coffin?
Mrs. Bates only took care of me.
My real mother
is somebody completely different.
How do you know this, Norman?
She told me.
On the phone.
Norman, I've already proved to you
that Mary and Lila Loomis
were the ones who were calling you.
Would you accept the fact
that you have no other mother
than Mrs. Bates?
Of course.
Then, that's what I'll do.
It would be a great load off my mind.
Okay, everybody stand back.
That's it.
Keep it comin'.
Looks like Toomey's car, doesn't it?
That's it, a little more.
We'll check inside
before we open the trunk.
All right.
That's it.
Do you recognize it?
Okay, hold it right there.
Well?
Sheriff, it's empty.
Don't you have someplace else to be?
Open the trunk.
Watch out, Mike.
Jeez!
Norman?
- Norman.
- What is it?
They found a car in the swamp.
- Who?
- I don't know whose.
They just found a car.
That's all. Isn't that enough?
- For what?
- For them to arrest you!
I'll get your jacket.
- Come on. We're getting out of here.
- How?
I don't know.
We'll hitch a ride until we get a car.
Where would we go?
Somewhere, anywhere, Norman.
Please hurry.
They'd catch us.
- Yeah, you're right.
- So, what's the point of going?
Because it's my fault.
If my mother and I had left you alone,
you would've been fine.
Nobody would be dead, and I'd just be
another dumb psych student
with nothing on her mind
but having a good time.
It's not your fault.
Then, whose fault is it?
My mother's.
She's the one who's been doing
the killing, to protect me.
She told me so herself.
Oh, Norman.
You're mad, don't you know that?
You're mad as a hatter.
Should I answer it?
Why bother?
It's only my mother.
Poor thing.
She shouldn't be calling.
She should be sitting back
and gloating.
I better answer it.
Hello?
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.
I just found Lila Loomis' car
parked down the road.
I'm calling you from the motel parlor.
The calls that you've been receiving
from your fictitious mother
have been placed right here.
Lila Loomis has used this phone
to call your house.
Yes, I...
I understand...
Mother.
Norman, this is Dr. Raymond.
I've been waiting for your call, Mother.
Hello, Lila?
Li...
She's hung up.
No, Mother, Mary's still here with me.
I like her.
No.
No, of course not.
Not as much as you.
No, I...
I won't do that.
You can't make me...
kill her.
Do I have to, Mother?
But why?
Why do I have to kill her?
Oh, no, Mother, please.
Please don't make me.
Oh, Mother, how can you
even think such a thing?
I could never do anything like that.
I don't think you understand
about Mary, Mother.
She's really very kind.
I trust her.
She would never do anything
to hurt me.
Norman?
Norman.
Do you recognize me?
It's me, your mother.
Yes, Mother.
And since I'm standing here
in front of you,
I can't very well be on the phone,
can I?
So, hang up the phone, Norman.
Hang up.
Yes, Mother.
Norman, put the phone down
this instant!
Norman, this is your mother.
Norman, can you hear me?
Norman?
Norman, are you there?
Norman, please say something.
Norman.
Norman!
Got you!
Norman, I...
I didn't mean to do it.
I... I...
I thought he was you.
It's all right, Mother.
Norman, I'm not your mother.
It's all right.
Norman, I am not your mother!
I am Mary!
How many times
have you killed, Mother,
and how many times have I...
Norman, look.
I am Mary!
And they're gonna come for you,
Mother, just like they did before.
Stay away from me!
And I'll cover up for you.
- Now, give me the knife.
- Stay away!
I always have
because I'm your dutiful son.
Stay away!
And you're my loving mother.
So, please give me the knife.
Time to go to the fruit cellar now,
Mother.
Norman, stay away.
Mother... I don't want...
Norman, now, look.
I don't want to hurt you, Mother.
You're coming.
In there, Mother. Hurry.
Norman, please stop.
You... You need help.
You're losing blood.
You did it.
They're here.
Let me help you.
You killed them all!
Freeze!
The county sheriff and DA
have come down from Bakersfield
to confer with Sheriff Hunt.
Is that loud enough, guys?
Yeah, that... that's, uh, good, honey.
Uh, move over to your left,
and I'll get City Hall
in the background.
Okay, we'll go in five, four...
Wait a minute. Hey!
...three...
All right, let's go. Go on.
- Can you get it?
- That's fine. Get out of here.
You want to read through this
and make sure
it's exactly what you said?
Can I get you anything?
Yeah, that's...
No, wait a minute.
She didn't say that.
She said if she didn't stay away,
she'd be sorry... sorry.
- Not that she'd kill him?
- No.
- Hey, could I get a cup of coffee?
- Yeah, in a minute. Just a minute.
Everybody's getting coffee
around here.
We broke in the door.
At this point, I observed the suspect,
uh, wielding a big knife on the victim.
I drew my service revolver and shot...
So, she and her mother
were trying to put Norman
back into the asylum.
Well, that much we know for sure.
Then somethin' went wrong
between 'em.
- What?
- They had a fight.
She wanted Lila
to leave Norman alone,
but she wouldn't.
We have a witness
that heard the whole thing.
So, she murdered her own mother
over Norman?
Looks like it.
What about the bodies
in the swamp?
The boy and that motel manager.
Mary and Lila Loomis did it.
They tried to blame the murders
on Norman.
Or maybe only the daughter did it.
She definitely killed Dr. Raymond.
I'll tell you, If you'd seen Mary Loomis
at the end,
you wouldn't have questioned it.
She'd gone mad.
Dressed up in Norman's mother's
clothes and a wig.
Trying to kill Norman,
and him hardly even able to
defend himself any longer.
Right till the end, she kept saying
Norman was the one who was crazy.
It was horrible.
What about it, Norman?
You ready to go home?
It'll all be in my report tomorrow,
gentlemen.
Uh, let's go out the back.
Someone's got to do something
about this pursuit.
Mrs. Spool.
- Hello, Norman.
- Come in.
I was just having some supper.
Nothing much,
but would you like to share
my toasted cheese sandwich?
Oh, no, thank you.
It's, uh, Ms. Spool, actually.
Oh.
You were expecting me.
Well, I was...
I was expecting someone.
I just wasn't sure when.
- Tea?
- Oh, please.
Milk and sugar?
That would be nice.
So...
are you really my mother?
The name Spool
doesn't mean anything to you?
No. Should it?
It was Norma Bates' maiden name.
The woman you thought
was your mother was my sister.
I had you when I was very young
out of wedlock.
I couldn't handle a brand-new baby,
especially being by myself.
I...
I had some trouble,
and the state put me away for a while.
That's when Norma took you in.
You were less than a year old.
Too young to remember me.
She never mentioned me, did she?
No, she, uh... she didn't.
I guess she didn't want you to know
you had a mother
who wasn't quite... right.
But... we know all about that,
don't we, Norman?
Mm-hmm.
After I got out,
you'd already had your troubles
and been committed.
I decided to wait for you.
And then when I saw
what they were trying to do
to my poor little boy,
I couldn't stand it.
So I followed them.
And one by one...
After all...
you're all I have in this world.
You're sure you won't have
a sandwich?
Pardon?
I know how it is, Mother.
You've had a long day,
and you must be tired.
I'll just put you to bed
and tuck you in for the night.
I'll even say your prayers for you.
Would you like that?
I'm not sleepy.
Put me in my chair.
Yes, Mother.
Now... turn me to the window.
I want to keep my eyes on you,
make sure you don't start playing
with filthy girls again.
Yes, Mother.
Good.
Well, what are you gawking at?
Go downstairs and open the motel.
What do you expect us to live on?
Hope?
No, Mother.
Remember, Norman,
I'm the only who loves you.
Only your mother truly loves you.
