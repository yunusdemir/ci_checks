But <i>mon cher ami,</i>
how can you be so calm?
This monster Bonaparte,
he's crossed into Austria now
and who's to say
that Russia won't be next?
No, no, no.
Our illustrious Emperor
has it all in hand,
our great army will stop
this monster Napoleon in his tracks.
You must remember, dear Anna Pavlovna,
Russia hasn't lost a war
in a hundred years.
I do beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.
Who is that young man?
I'm sure I didn't invite him.
Oh, my young relative, I regret to say.
Count Bezukhov's son.
His natural son, of course.
Oh, did he have any other kind?
Indeed.
But this one was something
of a favorite, God knows why.
He's staying with me
now he's back in St Petersburg.
Well, please don't bring him again.
He looks like a wild animal.
So unlike your own lovely children.
Such beautiful creatures.
Look at Papa, scheming away.
I think he's negotiating
to get you into a nunnery.
If he did, would you rescue me?
No, I'd say thank God and good riddance.
Beast!
Please, Mother,
it's embarrassing.
If you don't ask, you don't get.
Prince Vassily!
Prince Vassily.
You know I've never asked you
for anything,
I've never reminded you
of what my father did for you,
but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris.
A word from you to the sovereign
would be enough.
I'll do what I can.
What is it you wish for the boy,
Anna Mikhailovna?
Get him a commission in the Guards
and recommend him to the General.
You know a word from you would do it.
You know, my influence is
nothing Like what you imagine.
But I am seeing the sovereign
later this evening.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
I know I can trust you.
And when you come into your inheritance,
you will remember
Count Bezukhov promised
a regular allowance for my poor boy?
I know nothing of that.
And don't you think you've had enough
from the Bezukhov family?
Go and beg elsewhere.
Napoleon has utterly destroyed
his own country.
No, no, that's not right.
France is no longer a place
where civilized people can live.
Where is, though?
I say Napoleon is a great man, sir.
You think so, <i>monsieur?</i>
Shall we go to that table over there?
No, no, I must say this. Yes.
Yes, of course, Napoleon's a great man.
He stood above the revolution,
he put an end to its abuses
and kept all that was good about it.
You see good in revolution, sir?
The equality of all citizens,
freedom of speech.
Liberty, equality, fraternity. These are
ideas we could learn from in Russia.
Our drawing rooms
are full of overfed aristocrats
who have no idea what real life is,
who have even forgotten
how to speak their own Language.
By God, we could do
with a revolution here.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...
It was just...
Pierre, old friend.
Andrei.
It's so good to see you here.
Getting a taste of high society?
Yes, making a fool of myself, as usual.
You will excuse me,
my dear Anna Pavlovna,
we must take our Leave now.
A reception I must attend
at the ambassador's.
Goodnight, goodnight.
Having fun?
Yes.
Come round for a drink tonight.
We'll make a night of it.
Yes.
She's ravishing.
No hope for me, though.
I see her every day
and she hardly notices I'm there.
But your Lovely wife? Is she well?
See for yourself.
She's enchanting.
A woman like that
spreads happiness wherever she goes.
You're a Lucky dog, Andrei.
You think?
Has he told you?
He's going off to the war
and sending me away to the country
to have my baby all alone.
That's the sort of husband I've got.
Are you really?
She won't be alone,
she'll be with my father and sister.
But to have my baby in that bleak place,
with people I hardly know?
Lise, we have been through all this,
you know it's for the best.
Now, take the carriage home,
the doctor said you should rest.
I'll walk with Pierre.
You see?
He treats me like a child.
Lise.
No.
I don't care
if Monsieur Pierre hears it.
You have no pity for me.
You were never Like this before.
You see?
I don't believe he loves me anymore.
Dear Princess, please don't be upset,
I understand how you feel,
although how could I?
Not being a, but...
Well, life is very...
No, this is all wrong,
this is, this is none of my business,
I should go.
I should leave you.
No, no, no, don't.
I'll be good.
I know Andrei wants to talk to you.
You won't be too long?
No, my love.
Goodnight, Pierre.
You're really going to the war?
You don't think Napoleon's
the Antichrist like the rest of them?
It's got nothing to do with Napoleon.
Then why?
Because I can't bear
anymore of this Life.
Drawing rooms, gossip, balls,
vanity, night after night.
Don't look at me like that,
it's the truth.
Never marry, Pierre.
Don't make my mistake.
But Lise's not like that,
she's the gentlest, sweetest...
I know, I know. She's a wonderful woman
and I love her dearly but I...
I can't breathe here, Pierre.
I might as well get myself killed
fighting Napoleon.
But you're the most brilliant man
I know.
You could do anything.
So they say.
<i>And what about you?</i>
<i>Have you decided
what you're going to do yet?</i>
<i>Can you imagine,
I still don't know.</i>
But I do think I could make
something of my life,
do something extraordinary, even.
Lead the revolution, perhaps?
I know, I deserve to be mocked.
If you could see
how I waste my nights...
Ah, yes, well,
if you're asking for my advice,
I'd chuck Anatole Kuragin and that gang.
That sort of debauchery
doesn't suit you.
Oh, but the women...
The women and the wine
but, yes, no, you're right,
I've been thinking that myself,
I should stop going round there.
I will stop.
There.
You promise?
Word of honor.
Anatole. Anatole.
Petrushka!
Now, my dear boy. Get a drink.
Yes!
Dolokhov.
Well done, Petrushka.
What time is it?
Nearly noon.
Your behavior, and my son's behavior,
bring disgrace upon this house.
Your father is gravely ill in Moscow.
I'm leaving immediately.
Yes, of course. Did he ask for me?
You're in trouble.
You've been a very bad boy.
I'm really quite shocked.
I'm a damned soul.
Oh, I don't think it's quite that bad.
Give my regards to everyone in Moscow.
You're thinking of your father?
Of course you are.
We must be prepared for the worst.
He has had two severe strokes
and may have had another
by the time we arrive.
As an illegitimate son,
you mustn't expect to inherit anything.
No. No, no, of course.
To think what your poor cousin
Catiche has sacrificed,
what a saint she is, while you...
<i>However, I 'll do what I can
to see you are not left destitute.</i>
<i>God knows you've done little
to deserve it.</i>
Stop here!
What's the matter with you?
Where are you going?
I'll just call in on the Rostovs.
It's Natasha's name-day.
I will come to the house, it's just...
I won't be long, I promise.
Poor Count Bezukhov. He was ill enough,
but now this dreadful story about
his son Pierre will surely kill him.
Pierre? What's he done now?
He and Anatole Kuragin
and that dreadful Dolokhov,
they found a bear somewhere...
A bear?
Pierre!
and put it in a carriage
and went to...
To the actress's, you know.
And the bear got out
and when the police came, oh!
It's too shocking to say.
No, say it. Please, Aunt Anna.
They tied the bear to the policeman,
back-to-back,
and threw them into the river.
But was the bear all right?
Oh, he was very well. He went swimming
about with the policeman on his back.
How I would have loved
to have seen that.
Poor policeman.
No, no, no. You're quite right.
Shouldn't laugh, Natasha.
Well, you're laughing, too.
Yes, well, you mustn't take me
as a model of behavior.
So, what happened to the young men?
Dolokhov has been reduced to the ranks
and Monsieur Pierre has left Petersburg
in disgrace.
Thank God my dear boy Boris
has stayed away from Anatole
and his drunken clique.
Your son does you great credit,
Anna Mikhailovna.
He looks so elegant
in his Guards uniform.
Though I think Nikolai
looks just as nice.
Thank you, Julie.
It's all right.
We're all friends here.
I've just come to see Natasha.
It's her name-day, you know.
Okay, you be good girls now.
Monsieur Pierre?
Yes. I thought I'd, uh...
come in the back way.
Monsieur Bezukhov.
Oh!
Pierre, my dear fellow!
We've just been hearing all about
you and your dear bear friend.
Oh, please, please don't mention it,
I'm so ashamed of myself. I...
I just wanted to
come and see Natasha on her name-day.
Surely you should be
with your poor father.
Yes, no, I'm on my way there.
I just thought
I'd look in on you all first.
I'm so glad you did, dear Pierre.
Was the bear all right?
I think so.
That was all I wanted to know.
What's the matter with Sonya?
Natasha, go and see.
Don't go. Promise?
Promise.
Champagne?
Oh, I probably shouldn't...
Please.
What is it? What's the matter?
He doesn't love me anymore.
He loves Julie Karagina.
No, he doesn't.
He was just being polite to her.
He thinks she's ugly, and she is.
But now he's going to the war
and he'll forget all about me
and I know I'm just the poor relation
and your mother will
never let him marry me.
Oh, no. Anything's possible,
and he does Love you, I know it.
Wait there.
Nikolai. You're wanted.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Cousins.
1 know, but what can one do?
Look.
You've made her all upset.
Go on, go to her and make her better.
Go on.
Look.
Would you like to kiss me, Boris?
Um, I'm a little old for you,
don't you think?
There, now we're engaged.
Don't look so horrified.
How do you feel, Count?
Are you free from pain?
I came to ask you
if there's anything that you want,
any way I can be of service to you?
I understand, Your Excellency.
You need have no fear.
Ah!
Right, let's show them
how it's done.
He does this every year.
I'll never give you up. Never.
We'll be married,
no matter what anyone says.
I need a drink.
Monsieur Pierre,
should you still be here?
Why aren't you at your father's bedside?
You're quite right.
I know I should be there
but somehow, I'm afraid to go.
You know, I never really knew him,
not properly.
You have to dance.
No, no, I'm too clumsy.
No, you're not. Come, I'll teach you.
Natasha, I can't dance.
You can. Follow me.
All right, so what do I do?
One, two, three.
I'm off.
Like this.
Yes. That's it.
Dear Pierre, I'm so glad you came.
Monsieur Bezukhov.
What is it?
My father. He's had another stroke.
We'll go together.
Quickly, now.
It's a matter of life or death.
You must be a man now.
You have to look after
your own interests.
Don't expect your Cousin Vassily to.
You need to let the old Count see you
before he dies.
He might give a little sign, you know.
In any case, it will be so much better
for your soul
if you can kiss him before he goes,
he always loved you.
Yes, yes, I've been
a poor sort of son to him.
The Count has asked for Pierre.
At times like this, Catiche,
one must think of everything.
We must think about the future.
Oh! Cousin Vassily,
I think nothing of such things.
There's only one thing I pray for.
That his soul may
peacefully depart this world.
Yes, yes, that goes without saying,
but do you have his will
in safe keeping?
His true will, I mean.
Yes, of course.
And that other will he made
when his mind was disturbed,
naming Pierre, that was destroyed?
He still has it.
He has made many wills over the years.
But he cannot leave
the estate to Pierre.
I know you think I'm stupid
but I know this.
An illegitimate son cannot inherit.
<i>Un bâtard!</i>
But didn't the Count
write to the Emperor
to say he recognized Pierre as his son?
Yes, yes, but it was never sent.
And what does it matter anyway?
Don't you see?
If it's discovered in his papers,
Pierre will be Count Bezukhov
and inherit everything.
But what about our share?
My God, don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?
We will have nothing!
Nothing at all!
Catiche.
Listen to me carefully.
Our duty, my dear,
is to correct the Count's mistake.
We can't let him die having disinherited
his nearest and dearest, can we?
He wouldn't want that.
In any case,
he surely has forgotten about it by now
and he'd want that false will
to be destroyed.
Destroyed?
Yes, destroyed.
Where is it? You must know.
So at last you deign to turn up
at your father's deathbed.
Am I too Late?
We saw the undertakers
outside and I thought...
just touting for business.
The Count still Lives.
But really,
what were you thinking of?
I'm so...
You have no business here, I think.
I have a perfect right to be here.
You know very well
the Count is my near relation
and poor Boris his dear godson.
Who has more claim than us
to be here at this sad time?
Yes, yes, very well,
but you must expect nothing.
How is my father?
Very ill.
After this last stroke,
he's not expected to Last the night.
Truly?
Can I see him?
Would he wish to see you?
Well, perhaps later, he's sleeping now.
Is there any hope?
Has he been given extreme unction?
How precious these last moments are.
I must go to him.
We women understand what to say,
how to bring comfort
at such a terrible time.
He is not to be disturbed at present.
Do take a seat.
Of course he will wish to see his son.
Come, quickly.
Sit by him.
Take his hand.
Come. He'll sleep now.
I don't know what it was.
It's Like it sometimes is with a dog.
You know, he couldn't speak,
but he was trying to tell me something.
And he had such a strange little smile.
As if to say,
"Death's not so bad after all."
And I thought,
"I've been such a bad son."
Oh...
God sees everything and understands.
You think?
I'm sure of it.
Ah, Princess.
What do you have there?
Nothing. just some old papers.
I don't even know what's in there.
It just needs to be in safe keeping.
I'll look after it for you,
dear Princess.
Ladies. Ladies. Remember where you are.
Here, let me.
Pierre, come here. This concerns you.
Let go. How dare you?
What has this to do with you?
Cousin, why do you stand there? Help me.
Really. This is ridiculous.
Let go, the pair of you,
and give it to me. Now.
What are you doing? You leave me
all alone with him and now he's gone.
This is your future.
I know you will remember
what I did for you this night.
And remember Boris, he was his godson.
I don't understand.
You are Count Bezukhov now,
my dear friend.
My friend.
We sin so much and deceive so much,
and all for what?
Everything ends in death.
Everything.
But it's like a palace.
The Prince has just woken
from his afternoon nap, Your Excellency.
Of course. Regular as clockwork.
You're Looking older, Tikhon.
Mademoiselle Bourienne.
<i>Quel bonheur</i> for the Princess.
I will tell her you're here.
No, please don't.
Let's surprise her.
Oh, Marya,
it's so wonderful to see you.
I'm so very happy.
Are you happy?
Of course I am.
I'm very happy to see you.
Marya. Little sister.
How are you?
Andrei.
Still the same, little crybaby.
Are you really going straight to war?
You're not even staying the night?
Better not to hang about.
He's abandoning me here
and going to get himself killed.
God knows why.
I'm so frightened, Marya.
There is nothing to be frightened about.
She needs rest.
The journey was tiring for her.
You take her to your rooms.
I'll go and see Father.
How is he? Still the same?
The daily walk, the lathe,
the geometry lessons?
Oh, especially them.
I'm so stupid
and he gets so angry with me.
Only because he loves you,
you know that.
And now you have
someone else to think of.
Take care of Lise, won't you?
Of course I will.
Ah, the warrior.
So you're going to beat
Napoleon, are you?
About time somebody did.
Come here, then. Kiss me.
How are you, Father, are you well?
Only fools and degenerates
can be unwell.
You know me.
I'm busy from morning till night.
So you're joining Kutuzov?
Yes, I'm on his staff.
He's just about the only man in Russia
who knows what war's about.
And that includes our glorious Emperor.
So, you're leaving
your little wife with us?
You're very kind to receive her, Father.
Nonsense. Best place for her.
We'll take care of her. Don't worry.
And she'll be company for Marya.
They can be foolish together.
And Mademoiselle Bourienne.
What about her?
Is she the best companion
for my wife and sister?
Don't tell me how to run
my own household.
Am I to turn her out to starve?
There's no harm in her.
Besides, it does me good
to see a pretty face around the place.
Anything else?
Will you do one other thing
for me, Father?
What? What is it?
Go on. Say what you want.
When the time comes
for my wife to give birth,
will you send to Moscow for a doctor?
A Moscow doctor?
I know no one can help
if nature doesn't help
and very few cases end badly but...
You know, people have said things to her
and she's afraid.
And I have a little anxiety myself.
All right. I'll do it.
Bad business, isn't it?
What is, Father?
Women. Marriage.
They're all the same,
there's nothing to be done about it.
No use unmarrying them.
But don't worry,
I won't tell anyone.
But we'll take care of her,
she'll want for nothing.
She's a pretty little thing.
Now, listen. Take this to Kutuzov.
Tell him I remember him and love him.
Stay with him, learn from him
and you won't go far wrong.
Thank you, Father.
Very well. Goodbye, then.
And remember, if you are killed,
I shall be pained.
But if I learn you have not behaved
like the son of Nikolai Bolkonsky,
I shall be ashamed.
You had no need to tell me that.
Yes. Well...
We've said our goodbyes. Off with you.
Off with you, I say!
What is it? What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong. It's just his way,
you know what he's like.
Andrei, one thing before you go.
I know... I know you don't believe
but for my sake, would you wear it?
Father's father wore it
all through the wars.
And it'll help me not to worry too much
if I knew you were wearing it.
Please, Andrei,
for me.
Well, for you...
Thank you.
I'd better say my farewell to her.
Be kind to her, Andrei.
Why would I be anything else?
Andrei, if you had faith,
you would have turned to God and asked
him for the love you don't feel.
Yes, if only it were that simple.
Already?
Can't be helped, I'm afraid.
Stay, please.
No.
No!
No! No, please don't!
Take care of her.
Oh, Nikolai,
be careful, my dear.
Don't put yourself in any danger.
Mama, please don't fuss. I am a man now.
So is Boris.
Mama.
Don't they look fine in their uniforms?
I can't bear to look, for fear of
thinking what may happen to them.
Don't... Don't say that.
They'll come home safe, I'm sure of it.
I wish I could come with you.
I'd chop old Bonaparte down like this.
I bet you would.
Will we ever see our boy again?
There, there, my dear.
War is a terrible thing.
What has to be, must be.
And boys will be boys.
I'm going to make you proud of me, Papa.
I know you will, my son. I know.
Let's go.
Bye!
They've marched a thousand miles
but are in excellent shape.
You issued my order?
Yes, Your Grace.
We march tomorrow to join
with General Mack's army at Ulm.
And that's where
we'll stop Napoleon in his tracks,
God willing.
General Mack and the Austrian army will
be defending this approach.
We will attack the French
from the East, here.
I tell you I must see the General.
And I tell you he is busy.
I insist...
Go and see what that row is about.
As soon as he is available,
I will let him know you are here.
Until then you will have to wait.
I must see General Kutuzov.
As soon as he is available, I...
What is it?
You may give your message to me.
With respect,
are you General Kutuzov?
I am Kutuzov.
Your Grace, you see before you
the unfortunate General Mack.
What are you doing here?
We were to join forces at Ulm.
Napoleon outflanked us.
We suffered terrible losses.
I was obliged
to offer him our surrender.
What?
The whole army?
Seventy thousand men?
With regret, Your Grace.
Might I ask, sir,
what are we going to do now?
A good question.
We will retreat, of course.
Is that really all we can do, sir?
Our reinforcements are on their way,
we will retreat
until we can join up with them
and the other Austrian divisions.
This has been a bad setback
but the way to survive it
is to be prudent.
They call me
"the General who doesn't like to fight".
But only a fool would sacrifice good men
for a bit of glory.
So what's the matter with you,
young Rostov?
Nothing at all, Captain, except
retreat isn't what I went to war for.
I know.
You want to put that fine young horse
of yours through his paces, huh?
Well, you'll get your chance by and by.
And you may not care for it when you do.
What's it like, Denisov?
What's what like?
Actually, you know, being in combat.
Bloody awful
if you're on the losing side.
But seriously, it's one of those things
no one can tell you about.
You have to experience it for yourself.
Like being with a woman
for the first time.
Can be wonderful, can be terrifying.
You'll find out.
No word from Nikki yet?
You think they've forgotten
all about us?
I wouldn't be surprised if they had.
It's all right for them.
They get to do things,
we just have to sit about and wait.
Mmm.
To think of Nikolai in danger,
I can't bear it.
I used to cry when he fell over
and hurt his knee
and now he has to face bullets.
Don't.
Do you think about him
all the time?
Of course I do.
Do you remember him really well?
Remember exactly how he looks
and everything he said to you?
Yes, of course.
I do, too. Nikolai, I mean.
When I think of Boris,
I can't really remember him at all,
even though he kissed me.
I try to remember him,
but somehow his face doesn't come.
No. Nothing.
Isn't that terrible?
It's because you don't really love him.
Not in the way that I love Nikolai.
I just know
that I'll always love Nikolai.
Whatever happens to him,
whatever happens to me,
whether he loves me or not,
I shall be in love with him all my Life.
Will you write to him and tell him
how much you Love him?
He knows.
Will you write to Boris?
No.
No, I'd be ashamed to.
Ashamed? Why?
I don't know.
I just don't feel...
I feel awkward. False.
That's because you really love
that funny one with the glasses.
Yeah.
I do not.
Where did you get that from?
Seeing you dance with him.
What strange ideas you have.
I just can't get used to the idea
that suddenly I own so much.
All these houses, all these estates,
so much land, plantations, forests!
Surely it's wrong
that one man should own so much.
Well, you know, Count Bezukhov,
the saying is that
we don't own our earthly possessions,
we merely curate them for our heirs,
for the generations to come.
Looked at that way,
it's an honor and a duty.
Yes, but I'd like to share this wealth,
not simply hoard it for my children.
I want to change the way things are run.
Well, not that I have any experience
managing anything
but I want to do something useful.
Something good.
You've a noble heart, Count.
But I'd advise you
not to rush into things.
It'll be my privilege to look after
all those business matters for you.
Your priority now must be
to ensure your own happiness.
How?
Oh, it's you.
What a lazy sister I have.
I was out riding at dawn.
Get out, you smell awful.
What lovely smooth skin.
Stop that, Anatole.
You know you love it.
Listen...
Has Papa spoken to you?
What about?
He wants to marry us both off.
Me to Andrei Bolkonsky's
church little country-mouse sister...
Oh, she'd suit you perfectly.
And you, darling...
Who?
Guess.
I can't.
What do you say to...
Pierre Bezukhov?
You're joking.
I am...
not.
Oh, he's such a buffoon, Anatole.
Stop doing that.
He's a very wealthy buffoon
and he worships you.
He'd make a very docile,
adoring husband.
Hardly cramp your style at all.
But honestly, Pierre Bezukhov.
Oh, that feels nice. Do that again.
You'd better make up your mind to it.
Papa is determined.
It's not a bad situation, you know.
Just think of all those houses,
all that land
and all that money.
What a lot of jewels you could buy.
It's all very well for you.
You won't have to sleep with him.
So you're considering it?
I suppose I shall have to consider it.
Lucky Pierre.
<i>My dear Count Bezukhov.</i>
How very good of you to come
along to my little salon,
when you must
still be feeling so acutely
the death of your poor father.
Well, yes. But I hardly knew him.
Mostly, I feel embarrassed
by my good luck in inheriting
such a great fortune.
I've done nothing to deserve it.
Oh, now, Count.
There you are, too modest.
The very fact that your father
singled you out for greatness
shows that you must have
exceptional qualities,
which I discovered for myself
long since.
Really? I had no idea.
And Prince Vassily is advising you?
Yes. Yes, he's been very kind.
You couldn't do better.
May I ask what has been his advice?
Well, he thinks I should get married.
And so you should.
A man in your exalted position?
The Prince is absolutely right.
The trouble is, though,
women don't care for me.
Society women, that is.
I don't seem to have
the knack of talking to them.
Well, believe me, my dear Count,
it is not for you to concern yourself.
It is for the young ladies
to make themselves pleasing to you now
rather than the other way round.
As you can see for yourself.
I will leave you
with the Princess Helene.
Such a bore, these things, aren't they?
No, not exactly.
I Like to listen and talk
about the big things, politics, ideas,
the war and how to live
and what Life really means and so on,
but I always seem to say the wrong thing
and upset people.
No, you speak from the heart.
Of course that frightens people.
Does it frighten you?
Not a bit.
I Love it.
Ah, Bolkonsky. There you are.
We're in trouble.
Napoleon's armies have moved so fast
we're in danger of being outflanked.
Prince Bagration's
very nobly volunteered
to lead a detachment
and engage the French in battle,
whilst we continue to retreat
with the bulk of the army.
Goodbye, General.
God bless you for a great deed.
I thank you for the honor.
May Christ be with you, dear boy.
Your Grace, I request permission
to join Prince Bagration in this action.
It's 7,000 men against 45,000.
If one quarter of them
come back tomorrow,
I'll thank God.
That's why I'm asking to be with them.
Death or glory, huh?
Well, I won't stop you.
For God's sake, pull back.
We can't hold them, Your Excellency,
it's not safe.
Cease fire and reform.
We need the Pavlograd Hussars.
You. Take the message.
Sir.
It's all right. He's one of ours.
Captain Denisov?
Over here.
This is it, boys!
We're needed on the front line,
we'll need to break through
to get there.
Come on.
This is it, now.
Stay close and do what I do.
God be with us, boys!
Forward!
Hold it!
There they are!
Hold it!
Here we go!
Stay about me, lads!
All right, boy, all right.
You'll soon be up again, huh?
Little Rook, what have they done to you?
Over here!
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me, please, please!
All right, my little bunny rabbit,
no one's going to hurt you here.
Where did you come from?
My name is Count Nikolai Ilyich Rostov
of the Pavlograd Hussars.
My... My horse was shot from under me
and I've... I've hurt my arm.
Tushin!
Tushin! Tushin!
Tushin!
Pull the guns back, now!
You've done all you can.
This is madness, the guns are lost.
We should get out of this.
You go if you want to, I'm staying.
just hold on tight to me.
Oh!
It's a bit smoother over here.
You'll have to hold me.
Like this? Oh!
Charmant.
It's going well?
Yes. Yes.
But he seems unable to make up his mind.
I may have to force the issue.
What's the matter?
Oh.
You know...
What?
Come on.
Sorry.
It's just, I feel...
All this, what's happened, it's wrong.
You know,
it isn't what was meant for me.
That's just silly.
Come on, concentrate.
Touch me.
Come on, touch me.
Pierre?
Yes?
Was there something
you wanted to say to me?
The goose was very good.
Oh, don't tease me.
It's not fair.
After all of our conversations.
The thing is...
it's complicated.
Pierre, Helene...
Congratulations!
For what?
Take your glasses off.
What's happened?
We're engaged.
