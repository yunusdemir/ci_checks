<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>Welcome to tonight's show.</i>
<i>We're delighted to have with us</i>
<i>a talented musician and singer.</i>
<i>You know his work with The Flying</i>
<i>Burrito Brothers and The Byrds.</i>
<i>He's just returned, having</i>
<i>played with The Rolling Stones.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Gram Parsons.</i>
My God!
Oh, God!
What?
<i>He is dead.</i>
<i>He is dead!</i>
Hold on.
Tell me who is dead.
Parsons. Gram Parsons.
<i>We met at a bar.</i>
Are you sure he is dead?
Yeah, he's really dead.
<i>Listen. ..</i>
call an ambulance
and get out of there.
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Joshua Tree Inn,</i>
<i>room 8.</i>
<i>And another flames burns</i>
<i>out in the desert.</i>
<i>Gram Parsons, the bearer of the</i>
<i>new country movement is dead...</i>
<i>following an overdose of drugs.</i>
<i>While many young Americans</i>
<i>are saying mornings...</i>
<i>their parents will view this</i>
<i>as another example...</i>
<i>of how today's new drug culture</i>
<i>so easily claim a life.</i>
<i>He was so beautiful.</i>
<i>And he understood</i>
<i>what my heart was feeling.</i>
<i>I'll never laugh again.</i>
<i>My inner joy has gone.</i>
<i>He sang country music in a way</i>
<i>it had never been sung before.</i>
<i>It was country rock,</i>
<i>but he hated that term.</i>
<i>It's fair to say that when</i>
<i>Gram died, he died a star.</i>
<i>We'll leave you with</i>
<i>the young man's own words.</i>
<i>He wrote a song called</i>
<i>''In My hour of darkness''...</i>
<i>which contains these words.</i>
-And you are.
-I'm his road manager.
Oh I see.
His road manager?
You're not his physician
or a close relative?
Mr. Parsons is awaiting post mortem
to then be delivered to his family.
Speak to them if you wanna pick
through his personal effects, sir.
-You listen.
-No, you listen here!
Mr. Parsons is dead and no longer
appears to need a road manager.
Which makes two of us.
Hello, buddy.
How have you been?
-Good morning, doctor.
-Good morning.
What are you doing?
Taking some stiff to Neurology.
-We have no Neurology department.
-Urology.
Hold your horses!
Let me get my paper work.
I have the paper work.
You have your paper work.
I need to get mine.
<i>Gram Parsons was the best</i>
<i>friend I ever had.</i>
<i>The greatest musician I ever saw.</i>
<i>We loved it down here</i>
<i>in Joshua Tree.</i>
<i>We made a pact:</i>
<i>Whoever died first...</i>
<i>the other would come up here</i>
<i>and set his spirit free.</i>
<i>He gave me his word</i>
<i>and I gave him mine.</i>
Goddamn,
I'm so sorry, baby.
Out of a job again.
Never would've happened
if you'd been there.
How do you know I wasn't?
If you were there, you wouldn't
have let him die.
I'm still on staff, he was
still my responsibility.
Where've you been anyway?
How long this time?
Two weeks?
Yeah.
Let's have this conversation now,
after you spent 6 weeks on the road.
I usually leave a note.
And there's a paycheck involved.
Hey, lady!
Barbara, long time no see.
Don't try and schmooze me,
you repellent slime ball.
Is that the latest victim?
Meet Barbara.
Well, it's a lot tidier
than I remember.
-Who the hell is she?
-Gram's ex-girlfriend.
Girlfriend?
I thought he was married.
Welcome to the 70's,
sweetheart.
What do you want?
I'm here to fulfill
Gram's wishes.
That's nice, but I have
no idea what you're talking about.
Do you know what this is?
It's Gram's will.
''To whom it may concern.
I'd like it to be known that it's my
wish to leave Barbara Mansfield...
my assets and belongings
in the event of my death.''
Signed'Gram Parsons''.
That absolutely settles it.
That's the most impressive legal
document since the Magna Carta.
Still the jester,
and still very unfunny.
It's not a will and you know it.
No, it's better than
a will, darling.
It's a signed promise from Gram
to leave me all of his things.
It's none of your business, okay?
I'm here for the guitar.
-Okay.
-Thank you.
There you go.
Look, I don't have the guitar.
Gretchen, his wife,
took it 6 months ago.
Fine.
Then I want the masters.
I'll get them myself, thank you.
Wanna check
the cookie jar, too?
Why did you let her in?
It's all part of
the grieving process.
Do me a favor, sweetheart.
Will you go grab the guitar?
-Where are you going?
-I have to make a call.
Good afternoon.
The Joshua Tree Obsequies.
-Obs what?
-It's Latin, it means burial.
Parsons was shipped into
you yesterday. Is he with you?
<i>Yes, he was here.</i>
It was a real thrill for
such a small facility.
We nearly had Jane Mansfield,
back in 67...
<i>when she passed through...</i>
<i>but she was diverted to Frisco.</i>
We've done him up real nice,
but he's been moved on.
-Where to?
-New Orleans.
He's just left, so he's still
on the road to LA airport.
Hello?
Hello?
Phill?
Phill?
What are you doing?
Theses things aren't that big.
Okay.
Is that a problem?
Not really.
What are you up to?
It's best you don't know.
Alright. Keys.
I don't know what
this craziness is.
...but I'm not getting involved.
-That's the point.
I don't know what you're planning,
but I'm not bailing you out again.
I'm leaving!
Again?
This time I'm not coming back.
I can't give you any money
based on this piece of paper.
This isn't a piece of paper.
This is a promise from Gram
to give me all of his money.
Ms. Mansfield, Mr. Parsons is
a valued customer of ours.
-Was.
-Was.
We can't pass...
his money across to someone
who says they're in his wills.
We have rules.
You don't seem to understand.
These are his wishes.
Ms. Mansfield,
I truly understand.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Will you please tell me how
I'm supposed to get my money?
First you need to prove that
Mr. Parsons is actually dead.
As we have no record here.
Are you saying I'm lying?
Absolutely not.
To get his death certificate
would be a good first step.
Thank you.
Hey, man!
I'm looking for Larry Oster-berg!
Are you Oster-berg?
Welcome to my home.
Nice place.
What the hell is that noise?
Manomanjari on the sitar
by Nikhil Banerjee.
Okay.
There's no smoking in here,
I'm afraid.
Alright.
Who are you, please?
I'm Phil Kaufman.
And how may I help you,
Phil Kaufman?
-I'd like to hire your car.
-Why?
I'm picking someone up
at the airport.
-Don't you know anyone with a car?
-Yes, I do...
but yours is more suitable.
Why is mine more suitable?
It's a hearse.
How can a hearse...
be more suitable for picking
someone up from the airport?
It's a joke.
-A joke?
-Yeah. A prank, a surprise.
Okay. Is it a 200 dollars
worth surprise?
No, it's more like
a 50 dollar surprise.
I can lend you a bicycle.
-Besides, the car is booked.
-Booked how?
I use it to carry equipment
for a band.
Look, here's 200 bucks
to unbook it.
Let'em carry
their own trombones.
You don't have to count it,
you can trust me.
Let's see.
I never met you in my life...
you shout at me through my window
to hire my hearse as a joke and...
you're 20 dollars short.
Why should I trust you?
The last 20 is for gas.
I'm the one operating on trust.
I haven't even seen the car.
It's a hearse.
What else do you need to know?
Meet Bernice.
Bernice is a Cadillac Superior Royal
Tiara Limousine Funeral Coach.
429 V8 engine...
offers 340 BHP,
4600 RPM.
You're looking at a 21 foot beauty
with 156 inch will base.
Containing a 4 barrel
Rochester carburetor...
with turbo hydromatic transmission.
Bernice weighs over
6000 pounds.
It's yellow.
Yeah, it's yellow.
Bernice comes in yellow.
It's supposed to be black.
But they're all back.
That might be my point.
How is a yellow hearse with flowers
less of a surprise than a black one?
Because I paid you 200 dollars
for a black hearse.
No, you paid me 180 for a hearse,
and a hearse is what you got.
Take a long look at Bernice
and you'll see she's one of a kind.
She's big, fast<i>..</i>
she's beautiful, comfortable...
but she's not black.
Alright.
Give me the keys.
-Why?
-Because I gotta go.
You're not going
anywhere without me.
Shit.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
What flight are they on?
We'll wait here.
-What time is your flight?
-Soon.
Okay. How soon?
Why do you ask
so many questions?
I don't know.
Shouldn't we be at Arrivals?
Will you please shut up
asking me stuff?
Okay.
Okay...
How long are we gonna wait?
Morning.
What do you mean, morning?
We'll make the pick-up
in the morning.
You wait until morning.
I'm going home.
I'm only back because
I don't trust you with Bernice.
I don't even know you.
Do you think I'll walk away
and leave you with the car?
You got another thought
on the way.
Parsons.
You just arrived from
New Orleans?
And you're flying directly back
to New Orleans? On the same plane?
That's correct.
I hope you enjoyed your stay
at LA airport.
I'm here to pick up
my son's body.
He died here...
and I'm here to take him home.
Is that enough information for you?
I'm so sorry.
We'll see to it that you get all
the assistance on the journey.
Most kind.
-Can I help you?
-Yeah.
I'm here to pick up a coffin.
-Name?
-Mine or the stiff's?
-The deceased.
-Parsons.
-What was his name again?
-Parsons.
P-A-R-S-O-N-S.
Parsons.
He is a... musician?
Was. He was a musician.
Papers.
They'll be right along.
It's been a rush job,
they said you'd understand.
Well...
tell them
that we've got rules.
And this would the exception
to that particular rule.
We can't issue a certificate...
until we have official
notification of death.
He's dead.
At this current time...
the great Los Angeles Register
of Birth, Marriages and Deaths...
does not regard the newspaper as
an official recorder of record.
Here's your deceased.
Much obliged.
Good luck with her.
Yeah, that's a she.
Yours is supposed to be male?
-Gone.
-Gone?
What do you mean?
They must've got the wrong box.
The box has been loaded.
How do I get it back?
You're a damn thief.
That's very helpful.
Gram...
Barney, are you receiving?
What the hell...
-Excuse me.
-Why?
I've gotta get off the plane.
I just got settled in.
Excuse me!
Is that your hearse?
Hearse?
-Are you okay, boy?
-Okay? Sure...
What are you doing here?
Shit.
-Can we speed up a little?
-What's your hurry?
I wanna get to Joshua Tree
when it's still light.
-Joshua Tree? You said New Orleans.
-What?
When you came in you said
you'd take it to New Orleans...
but now you said
you're heading to Joshua Tree.
Joshua Tree, yeah.
Joshua Tree City,
Louisiana.
-I never heard of that.
-It's small.
Another local community
struggling to get by.
I don't like the look of you.
Wherever there is a hippie,
there's a crime.
Even if that crime hasn't
happened yet.
It's what I always say.
Here we are.
You should have told me
it was a Berkeley.
I need you to sign
before you go.
And three more.
What are you doing here?
We're meeting someone off
of a flight.
You're meeting someone off
of a flight?
In a hearse?
It's a surprise.
What part is the surprise?
The fact you're a yellow hearse?
The fact that you look like
something out of a horror film?
Or the fact that you're half
a mile away from the terminal...
and they're gonna have two
cross to runways to reach you.
-The first part.
-The first part?
Tell me what is going on.
It's early, but I need a drink!
Never signed so many bits of paper.
The hell with Vietnam.
It's paperwork
which slows this country down.
We're drowning in triplicate.
Good morning, officer.
Good morning.
I was saying how people
with work to do...
like yourself, officer,
are engulfed by paper.
Grab the end.
-Doesn't that drive you crazy?
-I guess it does.
One casket, six sheets
of paper to sign. Six!
That can't be right.
-Does that sound right to you?
-Sure don't.
The last thing I wanna do is hold
you up with any chatter.
Have a good day, officer.
Thanks for your help.
Come on, let's go.
Just a moment, boys.
Your sidekick told me you're picking
someone up from the terminal.
A surprise, he said.
And here you are, loading
a coffin into your vehicle.
The gentleman we're meeting...
doesn't yet know about
the sad passing of his aunt.
And you're gonna meet him
off his flight with her coffin?
We're doing it this way
for the avoidance of all doubt.
That's a real nice touch.
The ignition is a bit
temperamental.
Alright.
-You have to use the screwdriver.
-I see that.
Have a good day, officer.
-We did it! We did it!
-What did we do?
-What was all that babbling about?
-I didn't babble.
Goddamn hippies!
-You hit the wall.
-I clipped the wall.
There's a gap 50 yards wide,
all you gotta do is aim for it...
...and you missed the gap!
-I was distracted.
We were supposed to pick someone up
and you arrive with a coffin.
I just woke up.
Are you on drugs, boy?
Hello, officer. They make these
hearses wider than they need to.
Shut up!
Are you on drugs, boy?
-Not at this time.
-Not at this time?
You missed a gap of 50 yards and
you hit a wall in broad daylight.
Why was that?
Well...
Well...
Wait.
Fantastic, well done!
Now it's all my fault.
You hit the wall,
of course it's your fault!
Jesus!
Here he comes.
Well?
Well what?
What are you doing now?
He said to wait.
Nice doing, you made it through
the gap this time.
Jesus! What now?
-Get out.
-What are you talking about?
We gotta keep moving.
Get out and take your
friend with you.
Look, I see you're a bit sensitive
about this casket thing.
Get out!
Stop saying that.
I can't get out.
Why not?
Look man...
it ain't right to throw me out
in the street with a coffin.
Thank God.
-What are you doing?
-I'll drive you back.
-You can't do that.
-I'm driving you back.
Goddamn it!
Come on, I can explain.
-Parsons?
-Parsons.
-Was he in a Berkeley?
-What's a Berkeley?
A luxury casket of mahogany...
finished with
a splint hinged lid...
brass plated handles and
an engraved inscription plate.
Empty?
Absolutely, completely.
It seems awfully heavy
for an empty coffin.
They're made of the finest poplar,
and that's very heavy wood.
Poplar?
No way!
Mahogany or oak.
But not poplar.
I'm not gonna argue with you.
Poplar is very suitable
for making coffin.
So, why is there an empty coffin
in the back of my car?
I'm selling them onto
a company in Palm Springs.
Lots of stiffs, lots of money.
And they're very
environmentally sound.
And perhaps,
under these circumstances...
you and I should renegotiate
the financial agreements.
You gave the body away?
It's not like a bank.
People usually don't take
bodies they're not entitled to.
-Why did you give it to him?
-Because he signed for it.
Who signed for it?
John Nobody.
John Nobody?
And where do I find
this John Nobody?
There.
Wait!
Wait!
So then, Bobby transfers them
to boxes prior to cremation...
then I drive the caskets over to
a guy I know who resells them.
As new?
I'm not sure the''one careful owner''
thing works with coffins.
The whole thing is
completely immoral.
I saw how upset you were
when I mentioned money.
Think of it as recycling.
-I really need to get home.
-Why?
I just do.
I'll acknowledge the power of
your argument on the way there.
Sit back and enjoy the ride.
What do you mean,
the body was stolen?
Who the hell steals a body?
Kaufman.
Where's that son of bitch?
He isn't here.
He's stolen Gram.
He's stolen Gram?
They had some sort of
weird pact.
He's taken Gram
out to the desert.
Why?
I don't know.
Some voodoo thing...
with hot wax
and dolls to stick pins in.
That's ridiculous.
That's a wise move,
if you ask me.
I didn't ask you.
So where are the cops?
I called them.
There's supposed to be a funeral
in New Orleans, I gotta find my son.
New Orleans?
The man said he was driving the
casket to Joshua Tree, Louisiana.
Joshua Tree?
I still don't fully understand
what you do.
I do everything.
Everything?
This number's for drinking money.
By trade, I'm a road manager.
One of those!
Like a well-paid gopher?
No, not like a well-paid gopher.
I'm in charge of movement,
maintenance and management.
I'm a patron and a partner.
I'm a confidante and companion.
Agent and ambassador.
I'm like an executive nanny.
Not a gopher.
Executive nanny,
not a gopher.
Thanks for clearing that up.
He's a brainless
interfering asshole!
I don't know what it is
that you want exactly, but...
That's him, isn't it?
Phil?
Hey, baby!
It's your love machine.
God, what a horrible thought.
<i>You're not going</i>
<i>to write me off.</i>
<i>And when I get to...</i>
Phil?
<i>Hello?</i>
Sorry, Barb, I've gotta go.
Thanks a lot.
Kaufman?
What was that about?
Sun stroke.
You've hardly left the car,
how can you have sun stroke?
I'm susceptible.
You're a winner.
You are a winner!
You wanna see what
Kaufman is about?
You wanna see
what he's capable of?
Are you coming?
Pull up here.
-This isn't the way to Palm Springs.
-It is if you're a coffin smuggler.
I give up.
What now?
Yes, now.
-Are you an undertaker?
-Sure I am.
Ain't you supposed to be
in black?
No, we're special
rock'n'roll undertakers.
Musical morticians.
Can you slam some
high test in there for me?
-This car runs on regular.
-Who says it's for the car?
It ain't for the car?
Come on, hippie,
let's roll!
Sun stroke?
Good afternoon.
Hello.
I was wondering...
did you happen to see a hearse
in the last couple of hours?
What does it look like?
It's a big car with
a couple of guys inside.
Did one of the guys
get sick over there?
I don't know. Maybe.
Yeah. I've seen them.
So, the yin represents negative,
the dark side...
and yang represents positive,
good.
The first is earth
and the second, heaven.
The yin and yang symbol
is about the whole concept.
As you travel around the circle,
white and black will increase.
Let me give you an example.
So, what seems to be...
In order to truly
know good...
you must first know evil.
Without good as a comparison...
Yin yang...
you are waiting...
It'd be nice if we spent a couple
of hours without crashing the car.
I was distracted.
Of course you were.
I don't believe it.
In the middle of nowhere!
Quick! Get out of the car.
What now?
Pretend we're having
a conversation.
What about?
I don't know, since I met you
you talked yabber yabber...
religion, your supersonic
super charged car, the dark side...
and now you can't think
of anything to say?
Whatever your fool religion is,
I think it worked.
It's more of a philosophy
than a religion.
Religion is more...
Shut up.
G' afternoon, gentlemen.
Good afternoon.
How's it going?
It's going just fine.
-How are things with you?
-Good.
We just stopped to take a look
at this fine view you guys got.
It is nice around these parts,
if you like the desert.
How are things with you?
Well. Really well, actually.
Thanks.
I ask that because it seems you've
run into one of our road signs.
I'm surprised
you hadn't noticed...
because it appears to be impeding
your forward progress.
That's a funny line.
Thank you.
-Could you guys give me a hand?
-Sure, anything.
I'm looking for some fellows
that stole a body at the airport.
Stole a body?
A body.
Just like the one
in the back of your car.
That's an empty coffin, officer.
I know it sounds strange,
but these two guys...
stole a body and loaded it into
the back of a yellow hearse...
painted with flowers,
and they headed this way.
A hearse? Flowers?
He's onto us. He's just having
a little fun at our expense.
In the car.
The keys.
Goddamn!
He said body.
He said we stole a body.
-He meant a coffin.
-No, he said body.
I apprehended suspects in yellow
hearse with stolen body.
Tell me you've not stolen
a real person.
They haven't filed the report yet,
it'll be sorted out, trust me.
I'm over falling
with trust for you.
I feel this overwhelming
feeling of trust...
every time I look at you.
Damn!
What are we gonna do?
-Time.
-What?
We'll get arrested,
then we'll go to court...
then we'll go to jail,
that's what we're gonna do.
What if I could slip out
of this cuffs?
Great. Maybe we can suspend you
from a bridge in a strait jacket...
and light you up on fire.
Really. I can slip out
of these cuffs.
Show me.
I think we should go.
We'll be moving
on now that your sign...
no longer impedes
our forward progress.
Stop that car!
-You hit my bike!
-What the hell are you doing?
-Stay there!
-Turn it on.
I can't, he's got the key.
We can escape, but
we can only drive in a circle?
You're going to jail.
Are you crazy?
That's it. They're gonna lock me up
and throw away the key.
Why would they do that?
I drove into a cop's bike, that's
destruction of police property.
-You worry too much.
-Not until I met you.
-What we you doing?
-What do you mean?
What are we doing here?
What are we chasing?
I don't know about you,
but I need Gram.
That's touching...
but you gotta come to terms
with the fact that he's dead.
I know his dead.
But his body has not been
officially identified...
and there's no certificate
of death.
This is all about money.
Isn't everything?
I was an orphan at 14,
a waitress at 15.
I do things the way I do
because it puts food on the table.
I want what is mine
and then I'll be gone.
Real fast.
And why do you deserve anything?
Without my support,
he wouldn't have made it.
Until Kaufman came along
and shit on everything.
He's not responsible
for your problems.
-You lost him on your own.
-What do you know?
He can be a pain in the ass,
but when it came to Gram...
...he only did the right thing.
-Never in his life...
Phil Kaufman has ever done
the right thing.
Wherever he is right now,
he's having some fun.
That's what he does.
That's all that he does.
Jesus, what the hell is that?
A dinosaur.
Very perceptive.
What's it doing here?
Polyonax Place? Polyonax is
probably some kind of dinosaur.
Dinoburgers, reptile steaks,
primeval soup...
Titanosaurian portions,
pre-historical prices...
liqueur served.
Pull over, let's eat.
Let's not.
The cop's right on our trail.
We'll get on to Palm Springs and
do this thing so I can go home.
And you can do
whatever it is you do.
Just do it.
We need to stop, I'm hungry,
and I'm not very nice hungry.
I vote to keep going.
What gave you the impression
that this was a democracy?
Pull over!
Do you have any idea what
it's like to love someone?
Sweety, that's touching that
you're in love with him...
but unfortunately so is he.
I'm sure you're just handy
to have around.
Listen, bitch.
I'm going with you because
I wanna know what's going on.
Don't you tell me how or
what to feel about anybody.
Or I'll smash that
pretty face of yours.
Do you Kiss your mamma
with that mouth?
-You frighten him.
-I do not.
Everyone else he brings
the food he announces it.
Dinosaurus this, alosaurus that.
With us, he slaps it down and runs.
Probably to do with
that rabbit food you're eating.
Look, I'm a vegetarian.
I have a problem
with dead flash.
I get it.
This is stuff'll mess
you up every time.
Howdy.
Beer.
Would you put some
bourbon in there?
Sure.
Bad day?
Real bad day.
What happened?
My boy died out here...
and a couple of punks
stole his body.
The next shot is on the house.
Obliged.
We gotta go.
I haven't finished my drink.
Why would someone steal a body?
All gone.
Maybe they are souvenir hunters.
He was sort of famous.
Thanks, guys.
-Who is he?
-Gram Parsons.
Gram Parsons!
Gram Parsons?
Gram Parsons.
That's Gram Parsons's dad?
We gotta go.
He said someone took
Parson's body. Two people.
He was a real clever mouth,
he's never going to shut up.
-We gotta keep our schedule.
-Schedule? What schedule?
There is no schedule.
We gotta make our delivery,
get our package to Palm Springs.
Package?
We've stolen that man's son!
Stolen?
That's outrageous!
I'm appalled that you'd even
think such a thing.
I don't know
what you take me for.
I wanna see
what's in that box.
We gotta go.
It's heavy.
-Of course it is, wood is heavy.
-I remember, the finest poplar.
Jesus! Jesus!
Oh boy!
They gave us a full one!
We'll sort it out in Palm Springs.
My God!
You stole Gram Parsons!
Technically, we stole Parsons.
I stole a coffin,
I didn't know there was a body.
Save that line for court.
-What are you doing?
-I don't know.
What am I doing?
I mean, what am I doing!
Why am I here?
Why am I with you?
What's going on?
Calm down.
It was bad enough when
I ran over the cop's bike.
Now I'm a body snatcher!
lf you can wrap it up,
we could go.
Go? You go.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna go inside...
and I'm gonna give that man
his son back.
I'm gonna do the right thing,
I'm gonna follow my conscience.
-I'm going.
-Shit.
Jesus.
Come on.
Hippie, come on.
Hippie, come on.
Shit.
Come on.
Sorry about that,
but that's something I gotta do.
Welcome back.
-Why did you do it?
-Do what?
Have a guess.
I gave my word to Gram Parsons.
To cruise around the desert
until he started to smell?
Well?
I make a promise, I keep it.
You made me do it,
you jerk.
I never hit anyone
in my life.
You pushed and you pushed.
You gave me no choice.
Come on, Bernice.
Not your lights. Not now.
Shit.
Shit, shit!
Yeah?
I'm one of the guys
that took your son.
Where is he?
May I come in?
Phil!
What happened to your head?
A hippie hit it.
-I thought you had gone.
-Hold that thought.
What does that mean?
I need to know
what is going on here.
I told you! He's gonna set fire
to my Gram at some freaky ceremony...
with black magic and dolls.
Dolls?
I want my man back.
I had enough of this shit.
Where are the keys?
Shit.
Whatever happened to peace,
love and understanding?
-You're Kaufman?
-Yeah.
Hello, Stanley.
Remember me?
The psychotic girlfriend?
Hello, Barbara.
Nothing wrong with your memory.
Will you tell me
why you stole my son?
-I didn't know he was in the box.
-I'll cremate him in the desert...
where he felt at home.
That's what he wanted.
The hell you are.
-I can't let you do that.
-You have to.
I don't have to do anything,
Mr. Kaufman!
This is my loss, my son.
-It's to late to claim him now.
-What's that supposed to mean?
All he ever wanted was
your approval.
He wanted you to be proud
of what he'd achieved.
Of course I was proud of him.
I saved everything.
Every photo, every album,
every article.
But you should have told him.
You were his right hand man,
as well as his friend.
I was both, yeah.
When he died, you weren't there.
When he needed you the most.
That's right.
So the guilt is not all mine.
I guess not.
I lost him in life, and you want
to take him away from me again.
Can we just cut through this?
Okay?
You two stole the body.
Theft.
And you are a fool, you should've
called the police but hasn't.
Stupidity.
Let's call the cops
and get this thing done.
The sooner we get a death
certificate and bury him...
his soul will be properly
laid to rest.
Get your hands off me!
-Give me a chair.
-Let me out of here!
You're in trouble, Kaufman!
This is bullshit, Kaufman!
I was his road manager
and his friend.
We both loved it here
in the desert.
We had a pact that
whoever died first...
the other would come here
and set him free.
Gram gave his word
and I gave mine.
You're a couple of druggies,
why should I believe you?
I don't take drugs.
What about you?
Are you a druggie?
Yes, I am.
Stanley!
They're gonna burn your son!
Nice work.
-Sick bastard!
-Let's go.
-Hey, man...
-What?
I can't do this.
Do what feels right to you.
Goddamn it.
-You called them?
-No.
Are you gonna call them?
You haven't given me
a reason not to.
There is no reason.
lf someone tried to steal
my son's body, I'd stop them.
Are you prepared to go to jail?
We're expecting to.
Don't you worry, Kaufman.
It's gonna happen.
Mr. Parsons...
What is it, son?
I've been a junkie
for over four years...
I don't need to...
I've taken heroin, speed,
uppers, downers, blues...
morphine, methadone,
mushrooms, Quaaludes...
acid, valium, barbitures,
straight LSD, marijuana...
marijuana laced with opium.
Nembutone,
mescaline, of course...
and medicinal methaqualone...
which made me shake uncontrollably
for 6 days and vomit on the hour.
Very impressive, son.
-Not my point, sir.
-You'd better make that point.
I started my way through
this list on June 6th, 1969...
and there hadn't been a day when
I didn't at least smoke a joint.
Are you sure this is helping?
And now I've stopped.
I stopped because...
it seemed I had
something more important to do.
He is doing this
because he gave his word.
And I'm prepared to do it now
because I think it's right.
Everybody's got a soul...
and Gram's soul does not belong...
in some family plot
surrounded by strangers.
It belongs right here,
where it was happiest.
I'll go outside
say goodbye to my son.
Did you really take
all those drugs?
I don't remember.
Where did he go?
You're going to prison!
You'll be somebody's bitch
in there!
Thank God.
Listen, I know I was going fast,
but you have to help me.
They have stolen
my boyfriend's corpse...
and they'll perform
a ritual with his body.
Your license, please, madam.
-Excuse me. What?
-Your driver's license.
I just told you they stole a body
and you wanna see my license?
Okay...
officer Larcen.
You people are supposed
to be on the lookout for a hearse.
A hearse is a big long car.
You can tell
which one are the hearses...
because they have
coffins in the back!
The one you're looking for
is painted yellow.
Does this look like
a yellow hearse to you...
you homosexual!
Is that a ticket?
Are you writing a ticket?
Yes, it is, madam.
And yes, I am.
Turn off here, man.
Could you give me a hand?
Jesus, Gram!
Sorry, Gram.
What now?
Now we do it.
-Lift up the lid.
-What? Why?
Flesh burns easier than wood.
I have a problem with
dead flesh.
-You look a little peaky.
-A little decorum would be nice.
Right.
You think that's enough?
I don't know.
Maybe a little more.
-Enough?
-I'm not having a conversation...
about how much gas
you need to burn a human body.
-That should do it.
-There's a little left.
I'm sorry I wasn't there...
when you threw away your life.
I was there before and
I've been there ever since.
Good luck, Gram.
Here's my last one.
Jesus, what the hell is that?
That'd be Gram Parsons
on fire.
Maybe too much fuel.
I didn't factor in the amount
of booze he had in him.
Shit!
How do you know
that's your boyfriend?
I recognize the birth mark
on his shoulder.
You know, officer,
can I make an observation?
Knock yourself out.
We're in the desert,
and it's dark.
lf you wanna catch
somebody in the dark...
it's best not to turn
on your big flashing lights...
and make a big loud noise
with the siren.
You wanna know
what I think, madam?
No.
It was suicide.
Maybe he just wanted
to get away from you.
-Hello, Gram.
-Phil.
You think you should?
Not gonna hurt me now, is it?
Nice wheels. Very stylish.
They come in handy for transporting
dead people. Nothing better.
-I'm dead, then?
-You're more than dead.
You and your box are
down to bones and brass.
Well, alright.
Here's mud in your eye.
What can I do for you?
I guess I just wanted
to say thanks.
I'm taking care of business.
That's what you paid me for.
-That's what I do.
-You shooting for a raise?
Actually, I just quit.
Goodbye, Gram.
Goodbye, Phil.
I'm glad it all worked out.
What?
I'm glad it all worked out.
All what worked out?
It doesn't matter? Can we go?
I'm getting sick of sand.
Baby, we're boogying.
Get out of here.
Finish it.
Well, we did it.
We saved a soul.
Singed my damn moustache,
that's for sure.
Shall we?
Yeah, let's roll, hippie.
You got the wrong man.
I didn't do it.
