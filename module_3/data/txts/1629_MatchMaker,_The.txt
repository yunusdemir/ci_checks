Quickly, Reb Kalman,
or you will be late for the Sabbath
Over hills and mountains
through thick forests
goes a matchmaker
headed for Kabetzens, his home.
The tails of his coat
fly in the wind
and the matches drop
from his pockets.
Oh, Ruler of the Universe,
what a beautiful world
You created
and so much work you gave him
to arrange weddings
for all the sons and daughters
of Israel,
may they multiply
and be fruitful.
At face value, plenty of work
and a good living. Ay!
Let him finish one match
each month,
and he will promise
to make matches
for all the daughters of Israel
at half-price.
And don't get excited,
Ruler of the Universe.
Really, don't get excited.
Here it is, his town, Kabetzens.
A quiet town, peaceful,
ramshackle wooden houses,
narrow streets.
A happy family lives here.
That's his work, of course.
A happy family lives here, too.
That's also his work.
Certainly.
Nadlen, Come here a minute.
- May his bones be burned...
the matchmaker who matched me
with a catch like you.
This is his work also.
This is a quiet, peaceful town,
and in the windows of the houses
that are lit sit young women,
and in their eyes is
the yearning for a groom.
A groom, Reb Kalman.
Children, in the name of God,
without love, please.
You're taking away my living.
Oh, Lord of the Universe.
Good Sabbath, Leibelah
Leibelah? Leibelah,
Leibelah,
why don't you answer me?
Leibelah, I got a chicken
on account on a matchmaking fee.
I got home late today, huh?
I almost broke the Sabbath.
If only Moti Mefitzes
hadn't ruined the deal.
Oh, mother, mother, mother.
A whole week!
A whole week I worked
on the match.
Suddenly, over nonsense, he
doesn't like the father-in-law.
"On the sixth day He finished
the heavens and the earth
"and their vast array
"and God finished on the seventh day
all the work that he had done."
Well, well.
"...from all the work
he had done."
Leibelah, your mood
is like untimely rain:
Only makes mud and is useless.
I told you a thousand times
I'll get a little money
I'll find you a groom.
Till you get money,
my hair will go gray.
Oh, Leibelah, it's the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath, you must not be sad.
First of all, it's a sin,
and second it ruins the appetite.
I have not put anything
in my mouth since this morning.
Leibelah, why aren't you eating?
- My eyes popped out of my head
till you came home. - Well?
- Someone came looking for you.
And you were running
around Pichutz.
Someone came looking for me?
Who, might I ask?
The lord. - What lord? The lord.
Pinhasel? - Of course. - When?
Yesterday and also today.
- And what did he want from me?
I don't know.
What the matter? They know
it's the Sabbath now. They know.
Pinhasel?
Reb Pinhasel hasn't returned yet?
No, Miss Leah.
Who is that fellow there?
That's the teacher, the doctor's son.
A very polite fellow.
Very polite, eh?
Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath.
Start a war, they'll get beat
I'm telling you.
Oy, You don't, you...
- Ah, good Sabbath Mr. Pinhasel.
Good Sabbath, Reb Kalman.
- Good Sabbath.
He was once...
Reb Kalman, when the Sabbath
is over come visit me.
Yes Mr. Pinhasel.
Good Sabbath, Mr. Pinhas.
- Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath.
Good Sabbath, Reb Pinhasel.
Good Sabbath, Jews.
- Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath.
Good Sabbath. - Good Sabbath.
Seems I saw you before talking
with somebody by the window.
Yes. - Who was it?
Pinhas, let's sit down to eat.
- Who was it?
It was Max the teacher.
He gave her a book, that's all.
OK, let's sit down to eat.
Did you see the lord?
- Uh huh.
What did he want?
- A pedigree. A pedigree he wants.
The time has come for
his only daughter and it's hard
to find her a match.
A pedigree, he's afraid he'll be
the laugh of the whole town,
because someone with a genuine
pedigree won't agree
to marry a butcher
who became a cattle dealer.
Try to find a match for
that genealogy.
To think about business is
forbidden, but to completely
ignore the blessings of the
Good Lord also isn't nice.
Yehezkel Zaltzheim...
Averekh Kamnevrotzky
Then who?
Kuni Lemel?
Oy, Kuni, Kuni...
Dear Kalman, please,
make a miracle and find
something good and
a blessing will be upon you,
Shulmuneh Friedberg
Mayor of Kashetreich
Him?
- Not a word! Do you hear?
Till the Sabbath ends!
- Go to sleep, Father.
Leibelah, the goat!
Leibelah, come on.
Not one star has appeared
to declare an end to the Sabbath,
because they stop up there
and say: "Don't get excited
"Reb Kalman Solvitzik,
all will work out for the best"
There's one!
No, no, no.
There's another.
There, a good new week for us,
Leibelah, and all of Israel.
I'm going, Leibelah.
Bring me my work tools.
My umbrella. Hold him.
Come, goat. Come.
Quickly, quickly Leibelah.
May the hour be auspicious.
On the right foot, Father.
- I hope so.
Greetings, Reb Pinhas,
on the wings of eagles I came.
Greetings, Reb Kalman. Come sit.
Tzipileh, make something nice
for our guest.
The French language is
really very beautiful.
Should we stop for today?
- No, why? It's early.
Continue the dictation.
Good then write, "Je Vous aime."
Je... vous
I brought some sustenance
for the soul. How are you doing?
Mother, I'll just finish up
the dictation and I'll come.
What's written there? - Mother.
No, no, no. It's alright.
Your mother should know it all.
She wrote, "Je vous aime."
Ah, and what does it mean?
- It's a literary sentence.
Ah, well good. Continue writing
literary sentences.
Mother, tell them to lower
their voices down there, OK? 'OK.
"Je vous aime" means I love you.
Mother might understand,
and then...
Pinhasel, a little more quietly.
- What's the matter.
You're being very noisy.
- So?
The girl is studying.
- What's she studying. - French.
He's here again, the student,
the Doctor's son, eh?
A very polite man.
- Very polite.
Pinhas, don't bother them.
- It will be alright. Don't worry.
Out. Don't dare to come to my
house again. Do you hear?
Good-for-nothing. Don't come
to my house and
leave my daughter alone and
don't get any ideas in your head.
What are you doing, Pinhas
- No ifs or buts, say goodbye,
and don't say au revoir to me.
Hey, Max, we're here.
Doesn't hear and doesn't see.
He's really lovesick.
Wind it up, already.
Greetings. - Greetings.
Did something happen?
Pinhasel caught you?
He was angry. He threw me
out of his house.
But I'll fix him. I don't know
exactly what I'll do,
but I'll fix him.
If you need help we'll
do anything for you.
Well, well, what a scene
that was.
I told you. A match
is in the making.
Not really. - What not really? This
morning the two of them almost hugged.
The poor doctor's son.
After all he's an educated boy
Educated shmeducated. What's
important is there be a wedding.
Let's see what's going on.
Come on.
Well what's going on? - Nothing.
Meanwhile Reb Kalman is eating.
Leave my daughter be.
She's innocent like an angel.
Certainly she's an angel, and I'll make
sure she doesn't leave the house.
Guard! Guard! Buy yourself
a dog to help you guard.
Stupid. Why are you underfoot
all the time.
Will you have something
to drink?
We have to get her married
and as soon as possible.
If I had found her a kosher boy,
But what can we do?
She wants one that's not kosher.
A fine pedigree for me, eh?
The son of Doctor Benyocko
who earns his bread
by feeling pulses, leeches
and things like that.
Chaia Rachel, Chaia Rachel,
Chaia Rachel, pray.
If there will be a wedding,
we'll stand on our feet again.
Itzo, who's your bodyguard?
- What's the matter?
Why are you dreaming up there?
Come down to the lord's house
and see something.
The Rabbi says to hell with it
and went to sleep. - No matter.
What's going on?
They smell a wedding and they're
running around like crazy.
Well, get moving already.
Quickly.
You didn't play it right.
Your father the doctor
should have met with Pinhasel
and with the matchmaker.
With whom?
- With the matchmaker.
I'll get married by means
of a matchmaker? I love her.
Ah, that's very good but
with the help of a matchmaker
it could have been excellent.
Pinhasel, who but me knows
what a diamond you want
for you're daughter?
The evidence: I looked and
I found. - What did you find?
Someone very special.
Very special? Who is the boy?
He asks about the boy.
We have a pedigree here.
A fine pedigree for Pinhasel.
We have to strike while the iron
is hot. Reb Shulmuneh wants it,
you want it, everyone wants it
and I also want it.
Who is Shulmuneh? Shulmuneh?
A great lord with millions,
head of the congregation
of Shikhrivkeh. - Well, well.
Well, let's finish the deal
and not take into account
that he has a few little flaws.
Who? Shulmuneh? - No, the boy.
- Flaws did you say?
Did I say flaws?
He talks about flaws.
Ask first about his virtues.
Do you remember his grandfather?
It's Shulmuneh Friedberg.
Do you remember... who's Shulmuheh?
Firstly, he is a Jew with
a good head on his shoulders,
second, he's way ahead and
third, he is head of the...
You talked so much that I forgot
to ask you... - Ah, that's good.
What did you say about flaws?
- Flaws, nothing to speak of.
I think in his left eye he
does not see so well.
What do you mean?
The meaning is that in his right
eye he sees exceptionally well.
And if I'm not mistaken
his right leg is a little short.
Whose? Shulmuneh's?
- No, the boy's.
On the other hand his left leg
is very long and I have no doubt
that he is able to walk
a straight and narrow path
as well as any other boy.
And these are all his flaws?
'Almost all. - Almost?
He stutters a little bit.
Stutters? - No not really.
Only when he speaks.
Apart from that he is a treasure.
Grab him before others grab him.
- What troubles.
Don't get excited, Pinhasel
What's this? What's going on?
What's going on here?
Congratulations!
Leave me alone. Leave me alone.
Get out of here.
Pinhasel what do you care that
he has a long leg,
and with the eye.
A groom has to know that he is
a groom and all the rest isn't important.
I don't want a groom
that stutters.
Ay, that gives him extra charm.
He doesn't talk too much
like people do today.
What's important is the pedigree.
Think of the genealogy. You see?
The whole town is excited.
Don't you like the pedigree?
The pedigree is fine but my wife
is liable to say...
A scandal! Kalman the matchmaker
doesn't sell a cat in a bag.
Don't get upset. This very night
I will write to Shulmuneh
and ask him to send his son
Kuni Lemel straight to me,
not to you, to me. You can see
how you like him.
If you don't want him,
we'll send him back.
You'll see. You'll be pleased
with him.
Shulmuneh of Shikhrivkeh.
Quietly and carefully; so no one
knows. Greetings, Reb Pinhasel.
May it be an auspicious moment.
"Congratulations to Kalman.
- Let me breathe a little.
"A match like this isn't made
every day.
"Congratulations to Kalman.
Congratulations to the town.
"I have a groom for the lord."
"Reb Kalman, you have done
a great thing.
"An honor for the whole town.
"We'll slaughter three cows.
"Guests will come
from all over the world.
"We'll bring merchandise from
the capital and sell it all.
"The profession of a matchmaker
is to grab your children.
"I'll find you a son-in-law
to make your life miserable.
"You don't buy a cat in a bag.
You should know that.
"If the matter goes smoothly,
there is nonetheless a fault.
"Why are they celebrating here?
Why is everyone waving?
"The wise one celebrates a coin.
"The groom grabs himself a bride.
The matchmaker gets cursed.
"Why? - God only knows.
It's an honor for the whole town.
Certainly, certainly.
It's an honor for the whole town.
It's a shame, and a disgrace.
Hell, everything's lost.
- What happened?
The whole town is cheering.
Their chances are slim.
Imagine. Lame, blind,
and he stutters a little.
- I know, I know.
I'm closer than you think
to this Kuni Lemel.
What do you mean?
Kuni Lemel is the stepson
of my uncle Shulmuneh,
that his second wife left him
as an inheritance
from her first husband.
Shulmuneh and my father
are two brothers.
What do you know?
Two brothers and two worlds.
Listen, I have an idea. We'll
disguise ourselves as bandits,
and we'll ambush him on the
way and tie him up and
stash him away in some shack
in the forest until he loses
all will to get married.
But where is there a shack?
- We'll find one. A small detail.
Better, we'll disguise ourselves
as ghosts.
Imagine, all of us
dressed up in robes, eh?
But who has robes?
Every plan that we have
you ruin with your questions.
You'll soon want to meet him
with an orchestra.
If I could only talk to Pinhasel
quietly for half an hour.
But he doesn't let me even
get close to him.
Maybe I should have disguised
Myself as some... some emissary.
What emissary? A merchant,
a merchant.
No, not a merchant. A matchmaker.
- Yah! I have an idea.
You should know that I heard
everything that you discussed
with Kalman the matchmaker.
And you should know that it's
not nice to eavesdrop.
And to marry your daughter off
to someone who is
lame, blind and stutters,
that's nice?
Never mind, he has some minor
faults, but...
Maybe that's not all he has.
- Rivka, I'm getting angry.
Get angry all you want.
My daughter is not marrying him.
She will so. - She will not.
- She will. - She will not.
Dear famous governor,
erudite scholar,
strong leader,
worthy, understanding and
charitable.
I looked for him,
I didn't find him.
Yes? - Reb Shulmuneh, they're
angry at him everywhere.
What? - Just this morning
he broke a window
in Zelig the pharmacist's house.
- Well?
And stole Saraleh's, Gitel the
seamstress's daughter's braids.
Apart from that,
we have to get rid of him,
and as soon as possible.
Wait.
Well?
Look father, I made a
mask for Purim by myself.
Very nice, but Simchat Torah
is coming.
You can't ever tell when
it might be useful.
Is this an activity for a boy
like you, to play with animals?
I'm not playing.
The dog came in by herself
and gave birth. That's it.
That's what?
When he's hungry
he doesn't let me sleep.
Throw it out. - That's not nice.
Maybe it'll be an orphan.
Stupid! You're going to be a
groom and you're acting
like a schoolboy.
Why is he calling me names?
- Who is calling you names?
He just said that I'm
Going to be a g... g...
I'm too shy to say the word.
A groom, we're telling you!
A groom!
A letter has arrived from
Kalman the matchmaker.
Come here. Come.
Sit down.
Sit down. - OK, OK.
I'll read to you: "Dear famous
governor, erudite scholar,
"strong leader, worthy,
don't be excited"
Who's being excited? - What?
Don't interrupt me.
"We have heard that your
genealogy is impressive,
"and about your grandfather
the saintly rabbi, and about..."
What's the matter? - No matter.
We'll think of something.
He closes, "Therefore it will be
an honor for Reb Pinhasel
"to be matched with
an esteemed Jew like yourself."
I knew that you... that... that...
you were fooling with me.
In the letter it says that he
wants to be matched with you.
That means that you'll be the
g... g... the that thing.
So why do you say that I'll be
The g... g... the that thing?
Don't you understand? - No.
- It means that he has
a maiden daughter, and he
wants you to take her as a wife.
Why me?
A good question, eh?
They say that when a male child
is born an echo comes out of the
sky and declares the daughter
of so-and-so to so-and-so.
And perhaps the daughter of...
Reb Pi... - Reb Pinhasel
Reb Pinhasel is the one meant
for you.
W... will there be an orchestra?
- Two. One from Kabetzens,
and one from Shikhrivkeh.
I myself will pay all the expenses.
You'll get new clothes and a
solid silver watch.
Then it's really worthwhile.
Shulmuneh, how can you send
someone like him who... who...
St... st... stutters eh?
- Try to stutter less.
Who stutters? I st... st... stutter?
- No, I stutter. - That's right.
Never mind. Just remember, for a
groom, silence is a sign of wisdom.
In other words, shut up.
Just greet the in-laws.
It will be fine. Listen, y... you
be the in-law and I'll be Kuku.
I'm coming in and I say
all at once "grr..."
You say "grr..." very well.
"Greetings to you."
- Congratulations!
Practice that sentence.
I implore you.
At least one sentence you'll
know how to say properly.
G... g... good. May I go now?
Where are you going?
To play a bit.
- Yes, you can go.
And be it an auspicious moment.
- G... g... good. Thank you.
Tell me, tell me what happened.
Pinhasel, it seems, surprised
them at a sensitive moment.
He grabbed the boy by the scruff
of his neck and threw him
out of the house.
And in front of the whole town.
- That's nice? That's very nice.
Who is this teacher, eh?
- The teacher? - Do I know him?
The teacher? I think you know
him. Really?
Well, who is this unlucky guy?
- It's your son, Max.
Who?
You're joking, eh?
- I wish I were.
Do something, Doctor. Not for me,
but for your son, Max.
Something must be done.
Maybe you'll speak with Pinhasel
or even better with
the matchmaker.
With whom? - With Reb Kalman,
the matchmaker. - Hell.
Leibelah?
Good morning, Doctor sir.
- Good morning, Leibelah.
Is Reb Kalman home?
- No, he went to the post office.
Oh well, good.
- Can I take a message, sir?
No, no, no, some other time.
Leibelah,
are you healthy?
Yes, very healty. - Well good,
another time. - Leibelah, Leibelah,
My Sabbath jacket, quickly!
- Reb Kalman! Reb Kalman!
I wanted to speak with you.
- Another time, another time.
Doctor, I'm very busy.
- I'm Max's father.
I know, I know, but what would
progressive people like yourself
want with a poor matchmaker
like me?
But Reb Kalman, I wanted to tell
you something that
would interest you.
- Another time.
About genealogy, about Max's
pedigree, of course.
Doctor, look, lately I've been
having a feeling, it starts here
and passes here and passes again,
- Alright, open your mouth.
Ah. Stick out your tongue.
Say ah.
Well, some other time, Doctor.
I'm very busy, Doctor.
I'm very busy.
Where's the man of the house?
I have news.
The man of the house is busy now.
Just one moment to give him
the news. The telegram.
It's imperative. The groom
will come in two days.
It's impossible. He's fighting
with the Mrs.
Since you made the match they
haven't stopped shouting.
Only at night, for a few hours,
they take a break,
then they start all over again.
Well, listen, listen.
- I don't hear anything.
That's it, exactly.
They are exhausted.
Where are you going, now?
- I'm going to take a walk.
There's no reason to walk, now.
Stay at home.
What do you want from the girl?
She loves Max.
Max! Max! Nonsense. Tell me
did we play around with love
before we married? God save us.
I know that I didn't love you
before, I don't love you now
and I hope I won't love you
tomorrow. And so what?
Does it bother us? - That's
the problem. Nothing bothers you.
In this house I have the say.
- Who said so?
I say that I have the say.
- In your dreams, at night!
Rivka this time I won't give in.
- I'm won't give in either.
I won't give in!
- I won't give in!
Reb Kalman the matchmaker
is waiting. He brought this.
He says the groom will arrive
in two days.
Greetings to you Reb Kalman.
- Greetings. - Sit down, please.
What's written here? - Its from
him, Reb Shulmuneh. He writes:
What does it mean? What language
is that? - It's Russian.
It means the groom is coming in
two days. He writes:
"We sent our beloved son on this
auspicious occasion.
"Warm regards to the in-law
the great lord, the wise and clever
"Reb Pinhasel" That's you.
"Yours in love,
"Shulmuneh Friedberg, Head of
the community of Shikhrivkeh."
That's him, "Great-grandson of
the great rabbi of Meternsprat."
Well? - All this is written here?
- Certainly. - That good?
That's good. - That's good.
- That's good.
Max, I knew you'd come in spite
of everything. I love you.
I love you, too, Carolina.
But we'll have to talk fast.
Even all day long.
I'm not afraid.
If they force me to marry
Kuni Lemel I'll...
I'll do something terrible.
I'll kill myself. I won't eat.
I'll never love him
like I love you.
Listen. My friends will follow
Kuni Lemel on the road
And I'll come instead of him.
Do you understand? - No.
I'll be disguised as Kuni Lemel.
I'll limp like him. I'll stutter
like him.
I'll pretend to be
blind like him.
And I'll go to Reb Kalman's house
and he will bring me to your house.
Won't you be recognized?
You yourself won't recognize me.
You'll fool my father.
- Carolina, quickly.
Goodbye, Max.
- Goodbye, Carolina.
God willing, early tomorrow
morning you'll come to take him
straight to Kabetzens.
Fine. Goodbye Reb Shulmuneh.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
Greetings, Kuni Lemel.
Greetings, Reb Scherer.
Well? - It's as if it were made
for him. - Yes.
I'll just shorten this a little.
- Yes. - And this a little.
The trousers are fine.
And this the jacket will cover,
and it will be fine.
Congratulations. Do it and be
Finished.
But Reb Shulmuneh,
This is Ashberk's suit.
I promised it to him tomorrow
morning. What will I say to him?
Tell him you burned a hole in it
While ironing.
I burned a hole while ironing?
- Finish the suit.
Find excuses later.
At least he looks like a
well-bred person.
Have you been practicing?
Y... yes. Until I reach "Shhh"
Quiet. Come.
Should I give him money
for an inn?
What? Are you out of your mind?
Where will he live? Perhaps with
your brother the doctor.
No. By no means.
Fine, he'll stay at an inn.
Write a letter to the matchmaker.
Alright, I'll write him.
Come.
Once there was a wise Greek
whose name was Denostenus,
And he stuttered like you.
He did this. He filled his mouth
with gravel and...
A bit more, a bit more...
Try, try again.
Well, It doesn't sound bad.
Now take the nuts
out of your mouth all at once.
And say "shalom and greetings".
Shalom and greetings.
Unbelievable.
Shalom and greetings.
Shalom and greetings.
Shhh... and greetings.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
It will be OK.
It's in the bag.
Carolina. - Max.
How did you get up here?
It's OK. They're holding me.
- I love you, Max.
I love you too, but
I can't hold on much longer.
We can't, either.
What's going to happen, Max?
My father certainly
won't give in.
Usually my mother decides everything
but this time he's being stubborn.
Plates have flown in the house.
He won't let me leave the house.
Max, finish up already.
He's going to wear us out.
I told you. Tomorrow will be
the signal. - Yes.
Pas, Luksh, Professor and
Bereleh will do everything.
I told you. I will become
Kuni Lemel.
But why Max? Why?
Why? Why? Now she finds time
to ask why... why?
I can't hold on any longer.
Ay, you're stepping on
my foot.
Lift me up.
I don't like this whole thing
with Kuni Lemel.
You don't know my father.
I'm afraid.
If Reb Pinhasel insists that he
wants Kuni Lemel he'll get him.
And mother? What do I tell
my mother?
In time you'll tell
her everything.
Do you understand?
In war and love everything...
Are you alright, Max?
I'm OK.
I didn't get hurt at all.
Goodbye Max.
The leg is alright already.
What about the gate?
Come on.
"Bring a goat for the ram
to the small ram.

"Hey, who will be the ram?
And who will be a groom?

I never imagined that the world
was so big.
You're talking about the world?
You'd better think
about your bride.
G... g... good. I'm thinking
I'm thinking.
Do you know the Groom's Bible
for example?
Of course I know it.
Do you? What will you say
to the bride when you meet her?
C... c... count on me.
I... l... kn... know.
Really, what do you say to her?
Beautiful words.
- From the... the Bible?
Not from the... the Bible,
from the heart.
Fr... fr... the heart, I don't know.
I only know from the B... B... B...
That's it. For example, "Behold
you are b... b... beautiful my bride."
And what will you say if she's
not so beautiful? - I don't know.
It's my fa... fa... father's fault.
He... he didn't teach me anything.
And how will you treat the bride?
Ah, that I know. I b... b... break
the glass and
p... p... put the ring on her finger
and that's it. Finished.
Finished?
Here, drink Kuni.
Scherer? Are we fa... fa... fa...
- far from Kabetzens? - Yes.
When you finish talking,
we'll arrive there.
Is this your wagon?
What else? Yours?
Where are you Jews headed.
- To a saintly person.
Wh... which saintly person?
- Rabbi Noah the miracle maker.
Tonight he will be in Boldrik.
- Really, he makes miracles?
Well what do you mean?
Wonders and miracles.
Quite unbelievable.
Reb Scherer, perhaps we'll
take them to Boldrik?
I'll take you to Boldrik, but
first we're going to Kabetzens.
Get on the wagon. Get on.
Reb Scherer, I'll just gather
my things.
Who is this boy? - This boy?
Kuni Lemel. - Ah.
The great grandson of
the genius from Bricher.
Where are you going, son?
Well, to meet his bride, eh?
In honor of the occasion perhaps
we'll have a glass of wine?
It's cold today, eh?
Here are glasses. - Take a glass.
- Drink, drink. - Pour one for me.
Me too. Me too.
To life! To life!
To life! To life!
Congratulations
Drink, drink it all. Ah!
"Bring us drink for our lives,
our lives are just a game.
"Bring us drink for we
thirsted on the way to the inn.
"Bring us drink, our song is good.
Let us drink, our heart is good.
"Every man enjoys a drink.
Drink makes the world go round.
"Bring song to our life,
bring us song and we'll laugh.
"Bring us song for without song
there's no point to the game.
"Bring us song, our song is good.
Bring us song, our heart is good.
"Every man will enjoy the song.
Song makes the world go round.
"Bring us drink for our lives,
our lives are just a game.
"Bring us drink for we
thirsted on the way to the inn.
"Bring us drink, our song is good.
Let us drink, our heart is good.
"Every man enjoys a drink.
Drink makes the world go round."
Are you sure we'll get there
be... before he leaves?
What does he want to say? What?
Come on, come on. Lets go.
We're here.
- Tzivek, they're here.
They fell asleep right away.
We sent them to Boldrik, asleep.
Tomorrow morning they'll wake up
and start looking for a way back.
Paper, give me some paper.
I want to draw him as he is.
Here's the letter
to the matchmaker.
Let me work... Time's short
and there's much to do.
He's a very pleasant chap, this
Kuni Lemel, even though he st...
Stutters. First we ate
all his nuts
and now we're going to steal
his bride. You know what?
We should find him
somebody else.
An excellent idea and also
fair in terms of social justice,
but who?
We should have matched him
with the daughter
of the king of matchmakers.
The acclaimed matchmaker
who joins a wall to a wall.
What's that stupid girl's name?
I forgot.
Leibelah. - Leibelah, Ahuvelah,
Leibelah, Ahuva.
Ahuvelah, Leibelah.
I have a new plan.
Ah, look, take a look, ah.
Note the line, eh?
I've finished.
Not bad. - Nice.
- Not bad. - Quite a likeness, eh?
The hat.
A work of art.
You're like two peas
in a pod. What's your name?
Kuku... Kuni Lemel. - No, no, no.
Ku... Ku... Kuni Lemel.
Kuni Lemel... Leave it.
- No. Kuni Le... Kuni Lemel.
Ku... Kuni Lemel.
- No. Kuni Lemel. - Kuni Lemel.
Kuni Lemel! Kuni Lemel.
- Reb Scherer,
have we arrived in Kabetzens?
What's with you? Thank God.
I thought you'd fainted.
Where are the Chassids?
- Chassids? Clowns.
I dreamt about the saintly
Rabbi Noah.
He told me co... congratulations.
I'll bring you straight to
Reb Pinhasel's house.
"My father say's that the groom.
Must come when the time comes
"But for me, poor me,
this time doesn't come.
"My father says that every groom
likes to meet the person,
"Because without knowing
he's likely to be
"wealthy, bald and old
"Jane Doe found a rich guy
and Joan Doe found a snob
"And I alone in the whole town
haven't yet found a groom.
"And I alone in the whole town
haven't yet found a groom.
"My poor friend
caught a guy and married him,
"a groom who is a cardplayer
and doesn't come home at night.
"I don't know if my father
is just a matchmaker
"or also a prophet,
"but it's good that it's
customary to rely on luck.
"Jane Doe found a rich guy
and Joan Doe found a snob
"And I alone in the whole town
haven't yet found a groom.
"And I alone in the whole town
haven't yet found a groom.
"Haven't yet found a groom.
Haven't yet found a groom.
"Haven't yet found a groom."
Why are you standing around?
- What do I have to do?
Take the laundry down.
- I can't. The laundry is wet.
Today you hung laundry.
In a little while Reb Kuni Lemel,
Kuni Lemel, Reb Shulmuneh's son
will come. - Oy.
What's wrong? What do you want?
- I don't want a thing, nothing.
Go in and clean up the house.
Spill a little clean sand on the floor.
And remember, don't stick your
nose into places you shouldn't.
Do you hear?
Leibelah, get the rooster
off the bed.
And put a white tablecloth
on the table.
Well, Leibelah, maybe go out
and clean the yard?
Well, come on.
Sand, sand Leibelah.
Oy, quickly quickly.
Do... does Ka... Kalman
the matchmaker live here?
Yes, Kalman the matchmaker
lives here. What do you want?
I'm Ku... Kuni Lemel. The son of
Shulmuneh from Shikhrivkeh.
Oy! What? Greetings
Sit down Reb Kuni Lemel.
We've been waiting for you with
bated breath. Leibelah, he's here.
Where is Reb Shulmuneh, eh?
He will come after P... P...
Purim. - No P... Passover. - Well?
Because they're electing him
mayor of the to... to...
town? - Th... th... that's right.
You know, Reb Kuni Lemel
at the in-law's house,
you'll talk a little less.
I'll do the talking. OK?
Come in Reb Kuni Lemel.
Come in sit down and rest.
Leibelah, a cup of tea for
our guest, a cup of tea.
The boy is going to be here
any minute.
I have to talk to the girl.
Sit down.
I'm asking you not to interfere...
- No, Pinhasel, I don't agree.
I'm not buying a cat in a bag.
If she by all means doesn't want
him I won't force her.
Do you agree?
- Fine, I agree.
We'll see the boy at
the matchmaker's house.
Why there and not here?
- Because, God forbid,
if he is anything like the way
all the jealous people
are describing him, we can
get rid of him quietly,
so nobody will know.
Do you agree?
I certainly agree to that.
The girl is excited.
She wants to get married.
"My dear, my love,
I went to the matchmaker's house.
"He'll soon bring me
to your house.
"Please help me. Yours, M."
Mother! - A catastrope.
- Father, mother, he's here!
Who? - The boy, the groom whom
you brought for me, Kuni Lemel.
This is not possible! - Mother,
I put on my Sabbath dress.
Do you think he'll like it?
- What the hell's happening here?
They're standing at the entrance
and are afraid to come in.
I think something happened
To him. He's limping.
It's not from the journey.
- Well, never mind. That's OK.
Daughter, -Yes. - You know that
I've your best interest at heart.
Her best interest...
- Rivka
What'd you say if I told you...
- Ah, I trust you, Father.
I'm sure you'll find me
something very special. - Ah!
Tzipi Leah!
Open the door!
Does Pinhasel live here?
- Come in, come in.
Gr... greetings. - That's it.
Greetings Reb Pinhasel.
I brought the son of
Reb Shulmuneh from Shikhrivkeh.
Shulmuneh's son? - Yes, yes, yes.
Ku... Ku... Kuni Lemel.
I'm Reb Pinhasel and this is...
- M... m... my bride. - Oy.
This is my wife, may she live
long, and this is my daughter.
I have the honor of presenting
myself. Carolina, your bride.
C... C... Carolina.
I know, I know.
Sit down. Sit down.
- Thank you.
Oh, no! No! No!
Sit down! - Thank you.
Reb Kalman, when will you
show me my bride?
I'm running to the in-laws
to tell them you've arrived.
Leibelah, see that he's well
taken care of.
You sit here and
don't get excited.
Reb Ka... Kalman,
who is that girl?
My daughter is a
good, modest girl.
And pretty. Did you forget?
- Did I forget?
God forgot. - Ka... Kalman,
Is my bride pretty
like your daughter?
You'll see for yourself. Just
one thing I'd like to ask you.
A... a... ask, I'll explain it to you.
How is it that a well-bred boy
like you has something to say
about girls, eh? I know that a
boy like you closes his eyes
when he sees a girl
in the street, ah?
In the street, yes,
but between us, no.
Listen, at the in-laws house,
don't dare say things like that.
You hear? You're liable to ruin
my matchmakers fee.
Leibelah, see that he's well
taken care of.
Sit here and don't get excited.
I'm running to Pinhasel.
I'll be back soon.
Water, water. - Then I'll go.
Pinhasel, are you leaving me
alone with the maiden?
Is it allowed?
- It's allowed. It's allowed.
Water, water, Pinhasel, water.
Max... - Wh... what? Wh... what?
- You are fantastic, Max.
Why are you calling me M... Max?
My name is Kuni Lemel.
Stop playing for a moment.
Father will soon come back.
What do we do now?
We just met and you are cursing
me with plagues (mackes) of Egypt.
What do you want from me?
- Just one kiss. You deserve it.
My God, what devil has got
into you? Is it allowed...
Allowed to k... k?
- Stop playing now.
That's it, before the wedding.
- Kiss? - Allowed?
Gevald!
Max!
Max! Max!
Where is he?
He disappeared.
- What do you mean? Disappeared.
He suddenly disappeared as if
the earth swallowed him.
Do you want to eat something?
- No
Do you want a cup of tea?
- No.
If you want anything, tell me.
- G... g... good.
But I love you. - Are you
out of your mind? You're crazy.
Crazy! Crazy! Gone mad!
My fathers matches you with
Pinhasel's daughter and you
accost me, eh? You vile creature!
He slips seven times before he
manages to say hello,
but he has brains for this.
- What brains. The heart.
I'm crazy in love with you.
Your name isn't Leibelah.
You're wrong.
Rather Ahuvelah. - What?
- Ahuvelah, my dear.
Nice.
And for love one needn't...
Here I bend a knee before you
and ask you to love me,
and if not, I will hate you.
Ah, lame and stuttering and
suddenly you're cured.
What's going on? My father
matches you with
Pinhasel's daughter and you're
accosting me.
The fact I'm cured is a sign
that you are meant to be my mate.
Intended by heaven, and not
Reb Pinhasel's daughter.
While traveling here an
Incident happened.
A few Chassids got on the wagon.
They were going to Boldrik
to see the saintly Rabbi Noah,
a maker of miracles.
I said I'll go too, to receive The Rabbi's
blessing and congratulations.
We were traveling all night and
Suddenly a Godly slumber fell
on us, and when we fell asleep
the saintly Rabbi appeared
in a dream and said...
Do you want to hear?
He gave me a sign, that when I
see the girl intended for me
I will be like any other person
for three full hours.
Not lame, not blind and not
stuttering so I can speak to
her heart as a groom always does
with a bride.
And afterwards? - Afterwards I'll
return to the way I was,
but in the eyes of my bride I'll
always stay not lame, not blind
and not stuttering.
A miracle. A miracle was made
for you from heaven.
When you are in love, every day
is filled with miracles.
Love me Leibelah.
Ah, I'm fainting.
- Wait, not yet.
What are you doing there?
- She fainted.
Leave her be. She'll be alright.
Scram. The real Kuni Lemel
has arrived.
He disappeared. - Good riddance.
You were looking for a pedigree?
Genealogy? Some pedigree?
Yes, we fell into a trap.
And so, daughter, if you
don't want him by any means
I'll give in to you.
But I do want him Father.
There's something special about him.
He bewitched the child. How
can you explain it otherwise?
Congratulations, congratulations.
He's here. He's here.
Who? - What do you mean "who"?
Kuni Lemel.
This morning he arrived at my
house. He's waiting for you.
Hurry up, get dressed and come
with me. Tzipi Leah,
the lady's clothes.
Ah, Tzipi Leah, the carriage,
the carriage
What do you mean, "He arrived
and is sitting at my house".
I told you. The groom came to
my house.
But just a moment ago he was
here at our house.
I swear. - But he sat on the Couch.
And the girl was there.
Here are the refreshments.
I served them myself.
But Leibelah gave him
something to eat,
He is sitting and drinking tea
at my house.
No, at our house.
- No, at my house.
Our house! - My house! - Our house!
- My house! - Our house! - My house!
Our house! - My house!
- Our house! - So?
Reb Pinhasel, They mocked you.
They made fun of you.
Kuni Lemel is at my house.
He brought with him a letter
From Shulmuneh from Shikhrivkeh.
He sat and talked with the girl.
He drove her crazy.
A fine match you found for us,
Reb Kalman.
It would have been better if you had
matched this idiot with your daughter.
He has such a wonderful soul.
I wanted to kiss him.
And suddenly he disappeared.
- Ah? Oy. - You're telling me?
We'll go to my house and
you'll see he's there.
Rivka, let's go. - Pinya.
I ordered the carriage.
- Idiot, why are you interfering?
Get her coat, not the carriage.
Pinya.
Where do you want to go, son.
- I... I want to go home.
Where is "home"?
- I... l'm looking for Reb Sch... Sch...
Scherer. He already went back.
- Then how will I get home?
I'm Ku... Ku... Ku... Ku...
Ku... Kuni Lemel.
I'll take you soon. Scherer
took a room for you at the Inn.
Did you see your bride? Y... y...
yes. She's c... c... - Cute ah?
No, she's s... s...
- Smart ah?
She's brazen. - Really? - Yes.
She tried to kiss me on the neck.
And you're running away from
one like that?
Yes, but before the wedding.
Sit here. Eat first and
afterwards you'll go.
G... g... good.
Leibelah! Reb Kuni Lemel.
Reb Pinhasel and his wife came.
Greetings, Reb Pinhasel.
What greetings? Where is he?
Where is he? - Is he inside?
- He's... inside.
Bring him. - Right away.
Leiblelah!
I hope your eyes are opened so
you can see what you are doing
to your daughter.
Why is he taking so long?
Reb Kalman! Reb Kalman!
So? - What so? Where is he?
- Don't get upset Reb Pinhasel,
But he's gone. I went to tell you
and now he's gone.
Disappeared, my daughter too.
Oh! Where is he?
Who? - That lame one.
- The groom. Kuni Lemel.
It wasn't Kuni Lemel, it was
my groom. He disappeared.
Disappeared!?
- What do you mean "disappeared"?
Like in a fairy tale. First he
changed himself completely,
as if he turned into another
person and suddenly disappeared.
I guess the three hours that
Heaven gave him were over.
What is this nonsense she's saying.
Leibelah, are you sick, God forbid.
No father, I'm in love.
But he'll come back.
I'm certain that he will return.
Carolina... Carolina...
Who's there? You came back.
- Of course I came back.
But you forgot to stutter.
The went to look for you.
Where did you run off to before?
Everything went beautifully.
It wasn't me.
It was the real Kuni Lemel.
The real one? - The one and only.
- I kissed him.
Ah, and he... - almost fainted. He
shouted "gevald" and ran away.
Then try again. Maybe this time
it will be better.
Oh... woe is me, he's choking
my br... br... bride.
Just like me.
- Just like me.
Just like me.
- Just like me.
Wh... Who are you? - Who are you?
- Who am I? Kuni Lemel.
Shulmuneh from Shikhrivkeh's son.
I'm Kuni Lemel
Shulmuneh from Shikhrivkeh's son.
My God, my bride calls me Max
and he says that he's Kuni Lemel.
If you're Kuni Lemel then
who am I?
I don't know who you are. I only
know who I am. I'm Kuni Lemel.
I... l... l'm Kuni Lemel.
- I'm Kuni Lemel.
I... l... l'm Kuni Lemel.
How can you prove to me that
you are really Kuni Lemel.
Smart guy, everyone knows that
Kuni Lemel has a bad eye, limps
And st... st... that's it a little
when he talks.
I have a bad eye, I limp, and I
st... st... that's it, when I talk.
Gosh, if I didn't know that
I was me, I'd think you were me.
You must have disguised yourself
as Kuni Lemel.
I swear to you th... th... that
I was born Kuni Lemel.
Sh... Shulmuneh calls me Kuni Lemel
And Kalman the matchmaker
sent a special letter that I
should come take the...
dowry for a wife... th... the opposite.
Right. If you're really
Kuni Lemel, show me the letter.
The le... letter got lost.
Here is the letter.
- M... m... right.
In your place I'd be af... af...
- afraid. - Right.
There are laws.
Just a moment. - No moments.
We'll soon see who is the fraud.
Reb Pinhasel! Reb Pinhasel!
- Look Kuni Lemel,
why all this trouble? I'll go
home and bring proof
that I'm you and you're m... me.
No, no, no. The opposite.
That I, ah, you.
That's something else.
G... g... good.
What do we do now?
- I'm going to check in at the Inn.
You do only one thing? Whatever
they speak to you and whatever
they say to you, you'll only say:
I want Kuni Lemel.
I want only Kuni Lemel.
It seems he really is
Kuni Lemel.
Pinhasel, what are we doing here.
What are we waiting for.
Just a few more moments. Kalman
will come back in a minute.
Maybe somebody saw him.
And if they saw him, then what?
If he disappeared once,
it is enough but he disappeared
twice. That's twice as good.
Pinhasel, let's go.
This story will make us the
laughingstock of the whole town.
Let's go before everybody knows
that we're involved in the affair.
Maybe you're right.
OK. We'll go.
Come.
I saw two at the same time.
I saw two at the same time.
I saw two...
There are Jews who didn't see
him at all.
There are Jews who saw him once.
And there are Jews who saw him
twice at the same time.
I saw him at the cattle market.
- I saw two of them
at the same time.
- It's impossible that they...
two fools.
Good God. Who cares.
I'll turn all of Kabetzens
upside down.
Even if the earth swallowed him,
it will regurgitate him back.
Reb Pinhasel, Reb Pinhasel,
I myself am afraid to say things
like this but
perhaps one of the thirty-six.
Perhaps, the intended
for your daughter is one of the
36 saintly ones by whose credit
the world exists.
Right, -And they are known to
change shape and appearance
and from time to time disappear.
Look into this, Reb Pinhasel.
Everything is written about us
for the best.
Maybe he simply went home
to Shikhrivkeh.
I myself will rent a wagon and
go to Shikhrivkeh.
Reb Pinhasel... - Go.
"He'll be a husband to me.
A good hearted husband.
"He'll buy me shoes,
high-heeled shoes.
"And a dress with a ribbon
he'll bring me a present.
"I'll walk like a lady
among my friends.
"If he'd only appear,
God willing.
"If he'd only appear
all this would come to be.
"This one will say: 'what a fancy
coquette'
"This one will say: 'Leave her be
the snob'
"and another one will cry from
jealousy endlessly.
"And I the lady will walk
down the street.
"If he'd only appear,
God willing.
"If he'd only appear
all this would come to be.
"If he'd only appear,
God willing.
"If he'd only appear
all this would come to be.
"All this would come to be,
all this would come to be.
Oy Kuni Lemel,
What are you doing, here?
You startled me, Reb Todris.
- Shulmuneh went to Kabetzens.
Why?
Reb Kalman,
the matchmaker was here.
Afterwards they all went back.
The Shikhrivkeh orchestra went too.
They say to your wedding.
What wedding? N... nobody's here?
- I'm guarding here.
Did you go to Kabetzens
to see your bride?
Yes, b... but there they say
I'm not the real Kuni Lemel.
All of us are witnesses that you
are the real Kuni Lemel,
the one and only.
Go back to Kabetzens quickly.
Don't let them rob you of your
name. - What will I do now?
Come to my house. Sleep there.
No. I'll stay here. Maybe
they'll come back.
As you wish.
I myself don't know
who I am anymore.
He says that he's Ku... Kuni Lemel
and I say that I am.
One or the other of us is
I... l... l...
isn't telling the truth.
The whole thing is very very
st... st... st...
odd.
"I was Kuni Lemel still in my
childhood
"They called me Kuni Lemel
to my enjoyment
"And why would somebody
want to steal my name
"as if Ku... Kuni Lemel
"were somebody important.
"They say that I'm not me.
That's why I'm afraid.
"Because if I'm not me
then who am I altogether.
"They say that he is not he.
That's why he's afraid.
"Because if he isn't he
then who is he altogether.
Who are you? - Kuni Lemel.
Who are you? - Kuni Lemel.
And you? - Kuni Lemel.
And you? - Kuni Lemel.
What's this?
The whole world is Kuni Lemel.
"The title Kuni Lemel goes
before me.
"Because of the Kuni Lemel
my eyes darken.
"I thought Kuni Lemel was
the only one in my form.
"And behold Ku... Ku... Kuni Lemels
"Sprout up in front of me.
"They say that I'm not me.
That's why I'm afraid.
"Because if I'm not me,
then who am I altogether?
"They say that he is not he.
That's why he's afraid.
"Because if he isn't he,
then who is he altogether?
"A ma... magic spell you spun,
man or Satan.
"My b... b... bride you choked
in front of the groom.
"Which Kuni Lemel
is to blame for all this?
"And which Ku... Ku... Kuni Lemel
will have to suffer?
"They say that I'm not me.
That's why I'm afraid.
"Because if I'm not me,
then who am I altogether?
"They say that he is not he.
That's why he's afraid.
"Because if he isn't he,
then who is he altogether?
Woe is me.
Woe is me.
Woe is me.
He's coming
Scatter!
What's going on here?
Who's that there.
What? He's still here?
No mother, it's not Kuni Lemel.
- Then who? - It's Max.
Max? What in the hell is
going on here?
Quiet, mother. In a minute I'll
explain everything to you.
Woe is me!
Woe is me!
- Who's that? - Woe is me!
Kuni Lemel, what are you
Doing here?
Excuse me Reb Pinhasel.
Don't bother me right now.
I'm about to make contact
with ghosts.
In my yard?
Have you gone crazy?
Kuni Lemel, where did you
disappear to this morning?
Do you want me as a groom
for your daughter? - Oy.
Just say no, and I'll disappear
again immediately.
Kuni Lemel. Don't disappear.
What's that.
That's him. You must shake
my hand that you give me
your daughters hand
in marriage.
I'm ready and willing.
But we shake hand in the
presence of ghosts.
Ghosts? I'm afraid I
will slip up or something.
If you stand next to me
nothing will happen to you.
"Supreme ghosts, hear me
"Spirits of my family,
reveal yourselves to me.
"Reveal. - Oy! - Reveal. - Oy!
"Reveal yourselves.
"Oy vey! Oy vey!
He is addressing the supreme spirits.
"Do not fear. Hold on to me
as the voice is answered.
Ghosts!
Ghosts! Oy!
That wasn't me.
That was a real one.
What about the groom?
- Yes, I was at the inn.
I wanted to talk to him but he's
in his room with a high fever.
He has a sore throat. He didn't
even let me in.
We'll get a doctor. We have one.
- Yes, yes, I know,
but he'll get over it.
- Reb Shulmuneh,
at home in Shikhrivkeh...
- Yes?
Would he sometimes talk
with spirits?
With whom? - Spirits. - What?
- Reb Pinhasel, let's get started.
Let's get started?
- Congratulations. Please.

Does this suit me?

Rivka! - What's wrong?
- Well? - In a little while.
Don't push
Enough. You're pushing.
Ps... Reb Pinhasel, I... l'm here.
What's going on?
Now I'll prove to everyone that
I'm the real Kuni Lemel.
Who are you?
Reb P... Pinhasel, don't you
recognize me?
Get out, you clown.
Aren't you ashamed
to crash a wedding and make fun
of the groom's defects.
Get out before I make a
pile of bones of you.
What f... fun? Reb K... Kalman
The matchmaker wrote that I come
to take Reb Pinhasel's daughter
as a wife. - Well?
And also a nice dowry.
And here I am. I also have
a letter. - What letter?
Now I remember. The other
Kuni Lemel h... has the letter.
The other one? - The other one?
- The other one. - The other one.
The other one? Have you gone
out of your mind?
No, I've gone into it.
Gone into it...
Out, you contemptible creature!
Reb Pinhasel, don't you
remember me?
I never saw you before. Rivka.
I b... brought your wife water.
And your d... daughter, ask her,
She g... gave me... - What?
A kiss. - A kiss? Out!
All my worst nightmares.
Oh, here they come.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
I... l... l'm here.
I... l'm the real Kuni Lemel.
What? He's still here,
the nutcase. Get out.
It's all lost. Get out of here.
- Wait, wait.
Father! - A fine time
for climbing trees.
Father, That one is trying to
make fun of me. D... Don't let him.
I won't let him. Don't stutter and
get down from the tree.
Who's that there? What's this,
in-law? A Kabetzens sort of joke?
What, he's still here? Why
are you all standing around?
Throw him out.
- I can't get down.
Where is he? - Help me.
It's too high.
Ah ha, I've got you. You fraud!
- Leibelah, Leibelah.
Who the hell is that? - Leibelah.
- Another one. - Gevald! Gevald!
Leibelah! What are you doing
here, Leibelah.
This boy came to deceive you
like he deceived you.
He won't succeed with me.
At our house he walked and
talked like anybody else.
I'd also like to see
a miracle like this.
I'll show you wonders and
miracles right away.
Didn't you kneel before me.
I... I kneeled? It's forbidden.
- You talked differently then.
Who ever talked to you?
One moment, gentlemen,
one moment.
Exactly, Reb Pinhasel, well
soon clear up the whole matter.
Reb Shulmuneh, what catastrophe
did you bring us?
Who is finally the
real Kuni Lemel.
What, do you have twins?
You wanted a pedigree. There's
your pedigree. - One moment.
Who are you? - I... l...
Don't stutter. Tell me
who you are.
I'm Kuni Lemel. Kuni Lemel.
You see that I'm me.
No. I was deceived.
I was made a laughingstock.
Pinhasel, don't be stubborn.
Everything's lost now.
- I don't want it by any means.
I won't allow it.
- I'm really sorry, Carolina.
No, no, by no means.
He is not a groom for me.
Calm down, Pinhasel.
- Son of a wanton agnostic.
Reb Shulmuneh, only you can save
us. Make a miracle, something.
What can I do? What.
He's a good boy, Pinhasel.
He loves her.
No, I don't agree.
By no means. No.
You'll see what I'll do.
- Pinhas, calm down.
I'll talk to the Governor.
I'll call the police.
What can I do? What?
- You'll see! - Pinhasel.
You'll see, I alarm the
Whole world. You'll see!
You'll see. - Good, OK. If that's
what you want, go ahead.
Where is he? Muni.
Well, your son has cooked a
fine porridge.
Everything will be fine.
Where is he?
Upstairs in his room.
I'm going up to him.
Does he smoke on the Sabbath?
- He doesn't smoke at all.
But if he smoked, would he
smoke on the Sabbath?
Say congratulations, in-law.
OK. Call him. - Max! Max!
One thing I would like to know,
who the hell were the ghosts?
Oy, Pinhasel.
- Congratulations.
You may put the ring on the
bride's finger. - Congratulations.
Is it allowed? - Certainly it's
allowed. It's f... from heaven.
"They say that I'm not me.
That's why I'm afraid.
"Because if he's not he
then who is he altogether.
"He'll be a husband to me.
- A good hearted husband.
"He'll buy me shoes,
- high-heeled shoes.
"And a dress with a ribbon
he'll bring me a present.
"I'll walk like a lady
among my friends."
Only in their dreams,
matchmakers fly
and only in dreams does a
matchmaker succeed
in marrying his daughter
without a dowry.
Wake up, Reb Kalman, less
you be late for the Sabbath.
By foot, Reb Kalman, by foot.
A matchmaker walk
over lands and countries,
the corners of his coat
fly in the wind
and matches fall
from his pockets.
And before him towns,
hundreds and thousands of towns.
And in the windows
of the houses sit girls
and in their eyes, the yearning
and passion for a groom,
Reb Kalman, for a groom.
Two Kuni Lemels
