We need your help.
_
There are three of them.
Esme, Sophie and Phoebe.
They're politically
connected, wealthy, one of them
even infiltrated Senator
Montez's campaign last year.
That jackass is a straight-up Purifier.
They've got the right
enemies, that's for damn sure.
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.
With Esme and her sisters
back, we can't stay.
I don't want to be here, either.
That's why we have to stick together.
We're here about the Hound program.
- It's looking to expand.
- We want your help to stop it.
And you can get us to Campbell?
We can end this?
We wouldn't be here if we couldn't.
Your father was a member of
the Hellfire Club, a king.
You want to protect the child? Join us.
They murdered a dozen
people without even blinking.
Fire.
We need all the allies we can get.
No, the X-Men chose us for a reason,
and it's not 'cause we can kill.
We now have a weapon
that provides a solution
to our mutant problem.
Hounds bonded, their powers combined.
Put together a demonstration.
Bring it to Washington this week.
Breathe a little deeper.
Come on, Jack, breathe for me.
I'm trying. I just can't catch...
That's it, that's it. That's good.
That's good. Just get it out.
Come on. Here.
Don't you got a lecture to get to?
- No.
- I'm all right, bro.
No, you're not.
Your lung capacity's down 30%.
We need to talk to your doctor.
It's not the doctors, Rod.
I'm running out of time here.
Hey, don't talk like that.
- Well, it's the truth.
- Come on.
Doctors told Mom that CF
would kill me before I hit 40.
I'm already bucking the odds here.
Okay, okay, just...
Calm down.
- Here.
- Go.
You're already late, bro.
Just go.
I'll be fine.
It's okay.
One gene.
A tiny thing, less than a micron across,
but so terribly, terribly powerful.
A mutation in the DNA
sequence of a single gene
can mean the difference
between a long, healthy life
or a death sentence.
If I've learned one thing
in my years as a scientist,
it's that Mother Nature
shows us no mercy.
She's not our friend.
We're just another species on Earth,
forced to struggle for our survival.
For most of the last two million years,
Homo sapiens weren't the
only species of human.
The Neanderthal... Stronger than we are.
Had better resistance to cold.
And contrary to conventional wisdom,
they even had bigger brains.
So how did we stop them
from taking over the planet?
Why am I up here talking to you,
instead of some fellow with
a double-arched browridge?
Because genetics don't
have to be destiny.
We worked together.
We out-communicated the Neanderthals.
We built societies to defend each other
and literally wipe our enemies
off the face of the Earth.
They had stronger
genes, no doubt about it.
But we managed to
level the playing field.
And now, once again,
Mother Nature has rolled
the evolutionary dice
and created a new breed
with powerful mutations and abilities.
Some among us worry that
we're in danger of extinction.
Well, they're right to worry.
But we don't have to succumb
to the cosmic injustice of genetics.
This time, we can harness the
power of science for ourselves.
But if, and only if,
we have the courage to
stand together as a species.

I just want to make something clear.
We're working with you on this
because the Hound program
is a threat to all of us.
But if any of you think
that being here means...
- We're friends now?
- Oh, you made it clear we're not.
We're just here to get
a job done, same as you.
Marcos, they're right. Stay cool.
I don't see a move here.
The Hounds are already out there.
They're kicking our asses.
It's a secret program. We can kill it,
but it has to happen soon.
Our sources tell us Dr. Campbell
is working his political connections
- to take it national.
- What do you mean?
He's attending the Humanity Today Summit
- in Charlotte, tomorrow.
- "Humanity Today"?
Is that seriously what they call it?
- Mm.
- I guess they thought
it sounded better
than "Kill the Muties."
Every major anti-mutant
figure will be there.
Politicians, business leaders...
Purifiers.
Security will be massive.
- All right? There's got to be a better...
- We're out of time.
This is our chance to
grab Campbell and use him
- to smash the program.
- So we're kidnappers now.
I thought we're supposed
to be the good guys.
Let's not get so high and mighty.
I don't suppose you've
shared your criminal past
with everyone here?
Do they not know about your old friends?
Because we do.
But the past is in the past.
Right now, we have work to do.
It's funny.
Half of me can't believe
we're still stuck here,
and the other half is happy to be home.
Just glad we didn't lose our old beds.
Well, you are losing your pillow.
I get the good one this time.
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Yeah. What's going on?
Uh, we're heading up
to Charlotte tomorrow.
Might be our only chance
to grab Campbell,
and once we have him, we're
gonna need every angle we can get.
Did you have any luck looking
at your father's research?
Not much. He just gave
me his old notebooks.
And to be honest, I couldn't
follow much of the science.
Well, anything you can
get could be useful.
His research helped
build the Hound program.
If we're trying to take it apart...
I guess it's best to
start at the beginning.
We'll work on it.
- Good luck up there.
- Thanks.
John. We need to talk.
Hey, listen, whatever the Frosts
said about your past, I don't...
No, it's... I-I need to explain.
Clarice, we got a lot
to do right now, okay?
Will you please just listen?
Back in Clarke County, I had
trouble with some Purifiers.
Basically got run out
of town. I was pissed.
Started looking for people
who felt the same way.
I found some mutants
who were pushing back.
And it turned out that they
were part of the Brotherhood.
- You joined the Brotherhood?
- I didn't join anything.
I helped them with a few
things, and when they asked me
to do stuff I wasn't down for, I bailed.
Why didn't you tell us?
Sage asked me what I was arrested for.
Nothing I did with them...
That's not how it
works, and you know it.
I know I shouldn't have
worked with them, but...
It's not about that. It's
about hiding it from us.
Look...
I didn't tell you this before because...
for the first time in
forever, I felt safe.
I just didn't want to lose that.
You know, when you ran off,
and I went to look for you,
I did that because I
thought you were one of us.
I don't know. Maybe I was wrong.
Mr. Wong, please tell
me you have some results.
Actually, Dr. Campbell,
we've run into some issues.
Issues? We handed you an entire archive.
Reams of data from Otto
Strucker's research.
If he was able to suppress
the X-Gene in his son,
his conclusions must be in there.
I know, sir, but it appears that
a significant portion of
his research is missing.
Then I suggest you look harder.
What you need to
understand, the Hound project
is the key to fighting them
off, but Otto Strucker's research
can help us wipe out
the X-Gene entirely.
If some of it is missing, we
need to find it. Understood?
Of course, sir.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Before we head out, I...
I want to talk to you.
Yeah. What is it?
It's about the Frosts.
What about them?
Look, we're working with
them, like it or not.
Yeah, I'm in the "not" camp.
I'm not asking you to
change your mind about them,
but we have a job to do.
What do you expect me to do, Lorna?
Pretend like we're one big happy family?
No, of course not.
Come on. We're the family.
That's the point.
There's no way they
could come between us.
Look, don't do this for
them, do this for me.
Okay.
Are you seriously
reading that book again?
Why do you care?
Shouldn't you be hanging
out with your boyfriend?
Wes went back to Augusta,
for your information.
You barely put that thing down.
So? There's stuff about
our family in here.
- You're not curious?
- No, thank you.
I know all I need to know about
our psycho great-grandfather.
He wasn't a psycho.
All right, this book
was written by humans.
It's totally biased against us.
Andreas and his sister were
trying to build something.
- Uh, a-a place for mutants.
- Andy.
Why don't you look around?
We are literally in a place for mutants.
No, no, I don't mean,
like, a place to hide.
- That's all we're doing here...
- No. No, it isn't.
The Underground is saving people.
Those people were murderers.
You've heard of the
American Revolution, right?
Nobody ever called George Washington
a murderer for fighting
back against England.
This isn't some war fantasy, okay?
Whatever.
Now everybody's freaking out
about the Frost Sisters for some reason.
At least they treat us like adults.
The Frost Sisters?
Don't tell me they got in your head.
God.
- Those girls are liars.
- Are they?
Maybe they're the only ones around here
who are actually telling the truth.
_
Badges, please.
Good afternoon, Dr.
Campbell, Director Wolcott.
All right, you're all set.
Everybody's saying it.
We just got to get ready, man.
Hard times are coming.
You know what I mean, man?
We just got to, got to
do something about it.
Great, look who's back.
Are you talking about me?
Let's just say some folks were happy
when you left for Fairburn.
I don't know what your problem is,
but we're on the same side here.
You keep saying that.
Doesn't make it true.
Hey.
You okay?
Mm. It's nothing.
- Did you find anything?
- Not much.
Most of my dad's research
that we found is from
his grad school days,
but we can't find much
of his work on mutants.
There's something else. We're
not the only ones looking.
What are you talking about?
I've been checking the
genetic research boards.
Trask is talking to everyone
Otto Strucker ever worked with.
They're even sending someone to
an insurance company in Decatur.
Wait.
Southern Worldwide.
That's where your mom works.
Hey, speed demon. You
missed the bean sprouts.
Yeah, well, excuse me for not being
a professional waterer
guy. This is stupid.
You think Campbell's
gardening right now?
The Underground is
going after him, okay?
We should be doing that, too.
The way those mutants who
ambushed us in Fairburn
combined their powers,
their hands were joined.
Campbell got that from us.
We should be doing something.
Like what? Going out
and attacking people?
That's not how it works.
This place is a team
and we're part of that.
Kids, we need to go.
Sentinel Services and
Trask is sending someone
to speak to my mom.
Grandma Ellen? They
already talked to her.
That was just harassment.
This time, they're after something real:
- my dad's research.
- We need to get to her first.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
_
I thought we were
coming to a safe house.
- It is safe.
- And it's a house.
- Hence the term.
- It's just so bougie.
Well, if it'll make
you feel more at home,
we could bring in some mold,
smash some holes in the floor.
Don't worry about it. It's fine.
I'll see them inside.
Hey.
Just here to do a job, remember?
Yeah, babe. I remember.
There's a full security system,
and we're set up for a variety
of interrogation methods.
Although, I should be able to
extract any information we need.
And you have a fully
stocked bar because...?
Breaking Campbell could take a while.
Why live in squalor?
The X-Men started your little
crew before they vanished.
Our founders, they left us with more
than a pat on the back
and encouraging words.
You're talking about the Brotherhood.
So he's pretty and clever.
In half an hour, our
ticket into the summit
will be driving down a road near here.
We best get ready.
This is your room. Hope it's big enough.
Uh, yeah. Thanks.
Um, can we talk for a moment?
About what? Hmm?
I'm just really glad you're here.
Sometimes it seems
like you're the only one
who knows what needs to get done.
- Your boyfriend...
- Okay, let's not bring him into this.
Look, just because he's concerned
doesn't mean he knows what's best.
I'm not discussing this with you.
Lorna, you can do things others can't.
- Your friends, they don't...
- Stop talking about my friends!
Not bad.
You've been getting
stronger lately, haven't you?
I can see your father's power in you.
You know, some people think
pregnant women are fragile.
But there is nothing stronger
than a woman with
something to fight for.
You know where Grandma's office is?
Hopefully. I haven't been
here for a couple years.
Okay, call if you see anything.
If we run into trouble, you
two head back immediately.
Understand?
Come on.
- You sure her office is up here?
- Yeah.
You okay?
Yeah, just remembering what
happened when I saw my dad.
- Hey. This won't be like that.
- Hey.
Uh... aren't you...
um...
You guys are, uh...
I-I know you. You're...
Ally and Mark Young
from the party last year.
Hey. It's good to see you, man.
Yeah. I-I thought I...
Uh, will you say hello
to your wife for me?
We had, we had such a great time.
Tell her, "It's all about the donuts."
She'll know what I'm talking about.
- Okay, sure.
- It's good to see you, man.
That was... wow.
Okay, don't be too impressed.
He's still suspicious. Just keep moving.
Her office is over here.
What does it take for somebody
to clean a coffee cup around here?
Reed.
- Shh, shh, shh.
- Caitlin.
- Hey, hey.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
- Stay calm.
- Is there anywhere we can talk?
- In my office.
Um, my-my assistant's gone today.
- It's okay.
- Are you all right?
The police said... How are the babies?
They're fine. Look, I'll explain.
We don't have a lot of time.
Keep looking that way.
Sentinel Services comes,
they could drive up in either direction.
What are you doing?
Something happens, we need to be ready.
If we get into trouble, we
can make it worse if we...
If we what?
You understand who we are, right?
What we can do.
Sentinel Services does show up,
we're not the ones in trouble.
They are.
Andy.
Look, our power comes
with responsibility.
The last thing we want is
for them to be scared of us.
Maybe they should be scared.
If they were a little more scared,
they wouldn't be
coming after our grandma
just because she's related to us.
I don't understand. How would
I know about Otto's research?
I haven't seen the man in years.
That won't matter to them.
We just need you to come with us.
I-I have claims to fill out and...
Ellen, I know this sound
crazy, but it's true.
If these people even think
you know something useful...
What could I possibly know?
And you want me to run?
You're asking me to run
away from my entire life.
- It's not that simple.
- I don't think you understand
how serious this is.
- They came for Dad.
- Perfect.
Then it's Otto's issue.
Let them talk with him.
Mom, they killed him.
What? What-what are you talking about?
I was there, Mom.
They shot him.
And religious issues break the same way.
About 30% of Evangelicals
think that God's message was for humans.
A plurality believe the mutants
should be given sanctuary.
Listen, there's no question that
we've got a messaging issue.
Gun rights folks split
down the middle on mutant issues, too,
but the tides are turning.
Well, I hope you're right, Senator.
Look forward to your talk later.
- Oh, thank you.
- Sarah, good to see you.
- Yes.
- Senator Montez.
Dr. Campbell. So good to see you again.
- Always a pleasure. Sarah.
- How are you?
I, uh, heard about the
tragedy at Trask recently.
- Was horrible.
- It was.
But ultimately it just underlines
the importance of our work.
The mutants wouldn't have attacked
if they didn't understand we
were on the cusp of victory.
Well, I'm just glad you got
to come to the conference.
It's so important to tap into
this energy and enthusiasm.
I'm not much into politics, but
it is nice to be around people
who see the issue with clear eyes.
Well said. I'm looking
forward to our meeting.
So am I. I've got some
exciting developments.
Like to talk with you
about expanding our efforts.
- "Expanding our efforts"?
- Yes.
No. We discussed this
when we visited Trask.
I am aware, but the situation
has evolved since then.
The agenda for today's
meeting is already set.
We're talking about fighting
for humanity's survival.
The senator is in a unique position
to help us with our cause.
I think that merits revisiting
a few funding priorities, don't you?
- I...
- Let's hear the man out.
- I'll see you soon.
- Till then.
Dr. Campbell.
The Frost sisters are supposed
to be so well-connected.
This was the best way into the summit?
Look, guy's a big fund-raiser
for anti-mutant causes.
He attends the Humanity
Today Summit every year.
If we're with him, we get past the gate.
Yeah, I looked him up.
Guy made a ton of money
in pharmaceuticals.
When he retired, he decided he
wanted to contribute to society.
Oh, yes. His way of giving
back was going after mutants.
This should be fun.
Lorna.
I will play nice if he does.
They're on board with this, right?
Yeah. They're in.
We're looking for a silver sedan.
Should be through here shortly.
- You sure?
- Very.
He has an appointment with a
certain reclusive billionaire.
Unfortunately for him,
the billionaire's a mutant,
- and a friend of ours.
- Mm.
Still angry I brought
up your checkered past?
How'd you even know about that?
If you're poking around in my mind,
- I will portal you in front of a moving truck.
- Oh, please.
There was no need for a mind reading.
We have quite the network,
and everyone talks.
I don't see what you're
so wound up about.
My point is that we
have a lot in common.
- Is that him?
- Yup.
Let's do this.
Time to go.
You're asking me to believe
that my ex-husband was a mutant?
And-and he kept it
- a secret all this time?
- Mom, you must've had some idea.
- You lived together for 26 years.
- No.
No, not about this. No.
I mean, he had his secrets, but...
Mom, I was there when
he used his powers.
But it's not just that.
You know when I got sick?
- When I was ten?
- Yes.
That was him using a serum
to block the X-Gene in me.
Oh, God.
And that serum is probably
what they're looking for.
If they find it, they could wipe mutants
off the face of the Earth.
Please think. Did Dad have another lab?
Not that I know of.
Was there anyone who he worked with
- outside of Trask...
- Okay, we can talk
about this later.
- We have to go.
- I can't.
- I can't just leave out of nowhere.
- Hello?
Dad. Sentinel Services is here.
Have they seen you? You got
to get out of there before...
No, not yet. But they're coming.
Honey, this is crazy.
Mom, what's wrong?
- We're running from the police.
- I know, I know.
- But we've got to keep moving. All right?
- This way.
Here, I'll take it.
Go, go, go. Hit it.
If they get to the back of the building,
maybe we can find an
emergency exit or something.
There's no time. What about the car?
We can ditch the car. It's
safer to get everybody out.
Safe for who? Them?
- We just have to hold them off.
- What are you doing?
Protecting our family.
Wait, that's one of the Struckers.
Hands in the air!
Stop!
I said, put your hands in the air.
Right now. Where I can see them.
Leave our family alone!
Andy, stop! They're hurt!
- They still have guns.
- Andy, stop!
What the hell?!
Lauren? Andy?
Let's go!
- Impressive.
- We've made great strides.
And with the proper legislative support,
we could expand immediately.
I'm flying to D.C. after the summit.
To be candid, I can't do this alone.
Now, you know I've always
appreciated Trask's support.
But we do have to be careful
with the optics on
these types of things.
You're worried about public opinion.
Getting tough on
mutant crime polls well,
but stuff like this?
Listen, we are still paying
for the mistakes from the early days
of the Sentinel robot program.
With respect, this is very different.
In the assault on the Fairburn
Mutant Underground station,
37 mutant terrorists captured,
not one Sentinel Service agent hurt.
Still, rounding up the
kind of support we'd need
- to pass a new bill...
- If not you, Senator, then who?
You have a well-earned reputation
for taking this threat seriously.
The public is hungry for real solutions.
If you want to be more than
just a senator from Georgia,
there's far worse
things than being the man
who won the war for humanity's future.
You're making a big mistake.
There'll be people looking for me.
I guess they're gonna
be disappointed, then.
I have to be in a meeting,
and if I don't show...
Oh, don't worry about the meeting.
We just need you to make a phone call.
Thank you for calling Humanity Today.
Hello. This is Franklin Bennett.
Hello. This is Franklin Bennett.
I need to make a change
to my security detail.
I need to make a change
to my security detail.
Of course, Mr. Bennett.
One moment, please.
These guard uniforms?
They have our shirt sizes.
These people aren't
screwing around here.
John. All this time I've
spent trying to convince you
of things, I could've just
bought you a nice shirt.
I know that you're not about to go out
and start the Frost Sisters fan club,
but if someone is gonna
offer me this kind of help
to take down the people who killed Sonya
and killed Pulse, I'm in.
I'm going along with this
for you and for Lorna.
But... I got to tell you
this, I don't like it.
When I was in Afghanistan,
in the Marines,
I had to work with a lot
of folks I did not like.
But you fight the fight
that's in front of you.
Eyes on the prize. We got
to grab Campbell today.
I don't know what good this outfit does.
One look at my eyes...
Yeah, they get close
enough to see your eyes,
my hair, or the fact that
three of us are the same person,
then it's over already.
Something piss you off?
Was it the Frosts?
Yeah. They tried working on me, too.
Their whole "we're not
so different" thing.
Yeah, well, uh...
they might have a point with that.
What are you talking about?
They, uh...
they talked about the guy
they think is my birth father.
- Said he was a part of all this.
- So what if he is?
Lorna, I know about this.
You don't get born looking like me
without having major
X-Genes in your family tree.
You know, for a while,
I thought that mattered.
I thought that all the bad guys
in my family's past made me one, too.
Took me too long to realize
that a tiny speck of DNA,
it doesn't take charge of who you are.
I really hope you realize
that sooner than I did.
You think you're gonna
get away with this?
They're gonna track you down
and exterminate you like cockroaches.
Is that so?
You don't even deserve
to breathe the same air
as human beings.
You don't want to breathe the same air?
Then stop breathing.
We can see inside your sick
little mind, Mr. Bennett.
We can see the videos you
watch of mutants being tortured.
We can feel the hate.
Hey.
- That's enough.
- What?
You think torturing some sad old bigot's
gonna make our job any easier?
Cut it out. Now.
You're no fun.
Yeah, we got away, but they saw the car,
so we're dumping it.
Okay, we'll be there.
Thanks.
You sure you're all right, Ellen?
I'm fine, sweetie.
It's just a bit much.
I'm sorry, Mom. I wish
this wasn't happening.
I wish I could help you, but...
if your father had some
secret lab somewhere,
he sure as hell never told me.
Well, maybe it wasn't another lab.
Maybe... maybe he used
to talk to someone?
Maybe he used to go somewhere or...
What?
What is it?
Um, it may be nothing.
There was this researcher.
She and your father used to
talk late at night, and...
and they went on a trip together,
and I confronted him.
I was convinced he was
having an affair with her.
He promised that he'd
never see her again.
Did you ever meet her?
Yes. Once at the house.
She came to see you.
Uh, do you remember her name?
Madeline Risman.
It was decades ago.
Oh, Reed, I am so sorry.
For what?
All that time, Otto was making you sick.
A-And I knew there was something wrong,
but I was desperate, and he
said that he would cure you.
I should've protected you, baby.
- I'm sorry.
- You did the best you could, Mom.
We all did.
The Underground is sending
someone to pick us up.
Is Grandma coming with us?
Yeah. You'll have to
lay low for a while.
We've been staying with a group.
An underground group that helps mutants.
- You'll like it there.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
But I can't go with you.
What?
- Ellen, you...
- Look at me.
I-I would just hold you up. I
saw what happened back there.
Those people who are after
you, they mean business.
But they're coming after all of us now.
- You can't just go home.
- Home?
Reed, do I look like a complete idiot?
I have a friend in Boca Raton.
Lives way out of town. I
have enough cash to get there.
Uh...
Believe me, it's best.
Grandma.
I know it's weird that we're mutants.
But we're still the same
people we've always been.
Oh, no, sweetheart.
No, that's not true.
You're more.
You're so much more.
Andy.
- ♪ America, America...  ♪
- And I couldn't be more proud
to introduce a man
who's been coming here
for more than a decade,
a man who has always
fought for our future,
a human future.
Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Montez.
♪ From sea to shining sea. ♪
Thank you.
May I see your badges?
Welcome, Mr. Bennett.
All right, you're all clear.
Thank you. Them, too.
You know, I've always said
this summit is the
birthplace of great ideas.
And we need those ideas.
We need your energy and enthusiasm.
We need it to take our country back.
Since 7/15,
we've been a nation under siege.
People live in fear while
the mutants who terrorize them
hide behind the Constitution.
Was that the founders' intent?
To prevent their sons and daughters
from defending themselves?
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Constitution is a human document,
written by humans for humans.
It is time to stop being
politically correct,
time to stop coddling our enemies
and offering our friends empty promises.
Which is why I will shortly introduce
new legislation to defeat the mutants
who are trying to
destroy our way of life.
Okay, the second the speech is over,
I'll knock out the frequencies
for phones and walkies.
You're gonna need to hurry.
Once communication
goes down in this place,
it's gonna be crawling with security.
We can only keep them away
from the cars for so long.
We will not be staying
any longer than we have to.
Believe me.
This bill will help fund
next-generation programs
to wipe out our enemies
wherever they hide,
whatever their powers,
because we are done being afraid.
We are done living under siege.
It is time for humanity to prevail.
Yeah.
- All right, we got to make this quick.
- Hey.
I can get us past the
guards, onto that balcony.
From there, you can take
us to the elevators, right?
Yeah, yeah, but I want
to say something first.
What you did earlier,
when you stopped the Frosts
from torturing that guy, that
was the right thing to do.
Okay, I think maybe I was
too hard on you earlier.
No, you weren't. I should have
been more honest about my past.
It doesn't matter, doesn't matter.
What matters is who you are now.
That you're one of us.
Now, that felt real.
Let's do this.
You're lucky you made it to
your mother's when you did.
They sent another team to her house.
But you think she made it out
of town without them noticing?
So far.
Trask is not just after her.
Everyone who has ever met
Otto is getting a visit.
Well, hopefully we're
a step ahead of them.
- Did you get any leads from your mother?
- Maybe.
A researcher that my dad
worked with... Madeline Risman.
It sounds like someone we should find.
Right.
Okay, stop.
What happened in that parking lot?
We came outside, you
were both on the ground,
and you haven't been
speaking to each other.
Just a disagreement. Right?
A disagreement? You
attacked those agents.
They were gonna shoot us, I
stopped them, and we got away.
- You almost killed that guy.
- Yeah, key word: "almost."
Guys, I don't know what's going on,
but we need to stick together
as a family right now.
- Tell her that, not me.
- What?
Last time I checked, I'm
the one person in this family
who's actually proud
to be a von Strucker.
Look, I know it's frustrating, but...
But what?
This is just a phase?
No. But he's your brother.
You can work it out.
Mom...
something has changed in Andy.
He's not the same anymore.
Senator Montez is done with his speech.
Your sisters finished dumping Bennett?
They're on their way back.
Campbell should be headed upstairs soon.
They look so happy.
Nothing brings people
together like hate.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
Such a neat trick.
Lorna did her thing.
It's time.
You'll wait outside while I
meet the other politicians.
He's coming up, with a
few guards in the elevator.
Wait.
Sounds like there's three
more in a suite down the hall.
Then let's stay the hell
away from that suite.
Come on.
- Hey, Dr. Campbell.
- Yes?
My eyes!
Come on.
Children! We're under attack.
We're under attack. Just stay with me.
We don't want anyone to get hurt.
Get back in the elevator. Hurry!
Get back in the elevator.
Your move, Sunshine.
- Behind you!
- Run!
Get down!
Clarice! Get us out of here!
_
Come in.
Lorna, you have a visitor.
What you got there?
It's just a gift I got a long time ago.
From someone my mom knew.
That's nice.
You can come in.
Hello, Lorna.
My name is Evangeline.
Your situation was recently
brought to my attention.
- I'm an attorney and...
- A lawyer?
- Why would I need a lawyer?
- Well, according to
the court record, you were involved
in a Purifier counterprotest
that turned violent.
You were given psychiatric
care as an alternative to jail.
Well, yeah. The judge's sister
had bipolar disorder, too.
- Lucky me.
- For now.
If that judge knew how half
a dozen anti-mutant protestors
"accidentally" fell off an overpass,
you'd be in a maximum
security facility somewhere.
How do you know that?
I know a lot about you, Ms. Dane.
Since 7/15, things are changing.
A hard time is coming for mutants.
We need people like you.
- Fighters.
- We?
You've heard of the X-Men?
Yeah. Aren't they an urban legend now?
World went to hell and, poof,
- they're gone.
- Well, they left something behind.
A network to help mutants in trouble.
- It needs leaders.
- And they want me?
I think someone screwed up.
You do realize this is
a mental hospital, right?
Mm.
Well, maybe they see something
in you that you don't.
You think you're the only one
with demons inside you, Ms. Dane?
We all have them.
It's what you do with them that matters.
_
Where are they?
There's security everywhere already.
- They're going to find us.
- They'll be here.
If they failed, I...
There. There they are.
Wh-Where is he? Where
the hell is Campbell?!
We couldn't get to him.
- He shielded himself with a bunch of kids.
- So what?
- So, kids.
- Do you know how many people are gonna die if the
Hound program continues? We are
not leaving here without him!
- They're coming. We have to go.
- No! We can't.
- They're coming! We have to go!
- Damn it.
Suspects spotted. They're
fleeing in two black SUVs.
Attention all units.
Suspects are headed west on
Route 5 through Charlotte.
Two cars in pursuit.
There was a mutant attack here?
The threat has been
neutralized, Senator Montez.
- Then where are the attackers?
- Well, it's my understanding
they're being pursued as we speak.
The rest of the conference
events will be canceled,
- I'm sure, but we should go to the airport.
- Now?
You still want to
move forward with this?
Absolutely. This is exactly
the time to move forward.
This just shows how
seriously the enemy takes us.
This is our moment, Senator.
Now is the time to strike.

Something went wrong.
I wish I could tell
you more, but for now,
all we know is what we've
learned from the police reports.
- Did they get Campbell?
- No, he got away.
Well, keep us posted.
Guys, we got some bad news.
Not a lot of details, but it looks like
things didn't go well in Charlotte.
Dr. Campbell got away. They had to run.
Well, we should go out and back them up.
They're two states away.
By the time we get
there, it'll be too late.
Lauren's right.
They're on their own for now.
- So are we.
- No, maybe we can help. You don't know.
There are people to protect
here. When the X-Men founded
this place, they didn't say
"run off whenever you're pissed."
Our friends might not be coming back.
- Aren't you pissed?
- Of course I am.
- But we've got a job here.
- Guys.
- We can't keep fighting each other.
- Your father's right.
We have to be strong as a family.
I'm the one who wants us to be strong!
You mean you want us to
be the von Struckers again.
You sound like the Frost sisters.
What's wrong with that?
They're willing to face reality.
I mean, the humans are coming after us.
The humans, Andy?
Am I coming after you? Is your mom?
I didn't...
You know what I meant.
What's the story?
The boy, Andrew Strucker,
attacked the agents here.
Family fled before backup could arrive.
Well, maybe they didn't get
away as clean as they thought.
Sir?
Dr. Campbell sent us
a new pair of Hounds.
One's clairvoyant, the other one detects
organic molecules, turns
out, together they're
pretty damn good at finding people.
Let's go.
Right over here.
Family came through about an hour ago.
You got something?
Good. Let's go get 'em.
How could you just let
Campbell get away like that?
Uh, we didn't let him do
anything. What the hell are we
supposed to do, attack
a bunch of little kids?
You're worried about their
kids? Worry about your own!
No, he is on his way to D.C.
with a senator in his pocket right now.
- After today...
- We just gave them a hell of an excuse
- to expand the Hound program.
- I'm sorry.
- And-and this is our fault?
- Yes, this is your fault.
What we need to figure
out is where Campbell is,
so we can finish what we started.
I love you.
I love you.
Freeze!
How are we supposed to raise a baby?
We can barely protect ourselves.
The Frost sisters are checking
all the airports in the area,
but Campbell's gonna be ready now.
We're looking at a full-on assault.
Babe, maybe we should
get out while we can.
Look for another
chance on our own terms.
And if there isn't another chance?
- What do you mean?
- That conference.
I've never seen anything like it.
All those people focused on hating us.
Smiling.
Running in and attacking people
won't stop them from hating us.
- It'll only make things worse.
- We have to do something.
Look... I'm worried about you.
The way that you tore
down that telephone pole.
You haven't been sleeping at all.
Do you think that you might be...
Having a manic episode? No.
This is not about my
mental illness, Marcos.
This is about theirs... Those
people at the conference,
the people all over this country.
I thought if we had a child
that it would have
it easier than we did.
That we would build a better world
where our kid wouldn't have to hide.
We are building a better world.
It's just taking some time.
We have to have faith.
I always love that about you...
that you have faith.
- Andy, what are you doing?
- Grabbing my stuff.
I'm gonna go crash with Naya and Skyler.
- You're leaving?
- It's just upstairs.
I know you were upset earlier,
- but is this really necessary?
- It's not what you think, okay?
A month ago, I had a
bedroom with an actual door,
where I could have
some space if I wanted.
- We can't talk about this?
- Please. Space.
Probably just wants some independence.
Yo, uh, is it cool if I crash here?
Knock yourself out.
You guys heard about
Dr. Campbell, right?
Yeah. Crazy. They say what happens now?
No. It's nothing good.
- Scary stuff.
- Yeah.
I mean, this is what
Polaris is training us for.
It's times like this.
I wish she was here right now.
Hey.
Look, I know you're going
through a lot right now.
What happened at that
lab affected me, too.
Affected you how?
I mean, you've acted
like nothing's changed.
That day changed everything for me.
All of those people dying...
I can't get it out of my head.
But we have to focus
on making things better.
We rescued Dad and Lorna.
We helped save Trader when he was shot.
- Didn't that feel good?
- Yeah, of course it did.
But we're not little kids
playing X-Men anymore.
This is real. There are
people trying to hurt us.
And we have the power to stop them.
You mean the power to destroy them.
You're the one who denied your abilities
and almost destroyed the whole family.
Why would you want to do that again?
Director Wolcott.
I know you wanted an
update on our operations.
We're following up on
an attack in Atlanta now.
Making some good
progress. It appears to be
- related to the Underground.
- Well, stay on it.
The Humanity Today summit just got hit.
What, by mutants?
Who else? Dr. Campbell's
working on getting
political support in D. C. For
expanding the Hound program.
- We need a win here, Turner.
- I won't let you down, sir.
I had the Hounds check
the car and the road.
- What are they picking up?
- Two trails. One with Grandma
headed to the highway,
the other one follows
the rest of the Struckers
to the city outskirts.
All right, alert the
local police about Grandma.
We're following the family to
the Underground headquarters.
- Yes, sir.
- We're moving out!
You two, get in.
I know what you're
thinking, and you're right.
Your friends, your boyfriend...
They're not seeing this
situation for what it is.
Look, I have no idea
what you're talking about.
Yes, you do.
Campbell has to be eliminated,
one way or the other.
Someone has to make
some hard choices here.
And why are you so sure that's me?
Because whether you like it or
not, you're like your father.
Ugh, this again. Look,
I have nothing to do with
the guy you think is my
father or the Brotherhood.
And I really don't care what
rumors you choose to believe.
Not what I believe. What you believe.
Lorna, I'm a telepath.
I know that he gave you that medallion
for your 13th birthday.
All he ever wanted
was for you to be proud of who you are.
You know what has to be
done here... don't you?
What's wrong?
- Did the trail run cold?
- Not exactly, sir.
Hounds are indicating the trail
heads off into the woods up there.
Okay. And?
Well, sir, that area's a
toxic waste contamination site.
Whole area's off-limits.
Son of a bitch.
It's not off-limits anymore.
- Tell the team we're moving in.
- But, sir, they said
- a lot of people got sick up here.
- Is that right?
'Cause the mutants seem
to be doing just fine.
The humans they're
running around with, too.
- Wolcott.
- Sir, it's Agent Turner.
- What's the situation?
- I think we've got a bead
- on the Mutant Underground headquarters.
- Very good.
Take a run at them with the SWAT team
- for the lawyers.
- Okay. And then?
You still have that assault team
we used at Fairburn, correct?
Yes, sir.
Use whatever force you
deem necessary, Turner.
Get it done.
All right, everyone, I
just spoke to the director.
We're going in. I...
Something's wrong, sir.
I think you're making a
mistake. The-the contamination...
I-I don't, uh...
No.
No. No.
This is it, damn it.
The Hounds aren't wrong. This is it.
- But, sir, I think...
- Listen to me.
My worst fears have
already come true twice.
We are not backing down.
Whatever you're feeling right now,
you're gonna fight through it!
We're going in.
Sentinel Services!
They're coming! They're coming now!
Everybody, listen up!
This is not a drill!
We're evacuating right the hell now,
so drop whatever you're doing and move!
- What happened?
- Sentinel Services is coming.
We got to get as many people in vans
- and out of here as we can.
- Get the kids.
- Mom. Is this real?
- Yeah.
Go find your brother.
You. I need you to help
me get the little ones out.
You'll drive the first van.
- Hide them.
- Who put you in charge?
Don't start that crap with me.
Hate me all you want
once everyone's safe,
but right now you will move.
I need all hard drives,
all communication devices!
- Andy!
- Hey.
- Why are we evacuating?
- Sentinel Services.
- They're coming.
- What are we gonna do?
They're attacking our
home. Are we gonna fight?
We will do whatever we have
to do to protect these people.
That is our job.
- Can't get ahold of anyone at HQ?
- It rang a few times,
then cut out, and then when
I just called back, nothing.
John. I can't find Lorna.
What do you mean, you can't
find her? She was just here.
And now she's not. I looked everywhere.
You're right.
And she's not the only one missing.
Hey.
- The hell's going on?
- Something wrong?
Yeah, something's wrong.
We can't find Lorna.
She left with your sisters.
They're doing what you couldn't.
Campbell and Montez filed a flight plan.
They fly out of Morrison
Air Center in 20 minutes.
The most important thing is to make sure
- he doesn't get to D. C. Ever.
- Whoa.
It's an assassination now?
Look, I hate that son of a bitch...
- John.
- ...but that goes against everything
- we stand for! No!
- Please. John, please.
If we start killing,
it's gonna make life worse
for mutants everywhere.
John, life is already worse
for mutants everywhere.
- You know I'm right.
- Ah, shut up!
- Marcos...
- Don't say another word!
Now, we are gonna go
get Lorna, right now.
And if I see your eyes turn blue,
I swear to God I will be
the last thing you see.
Let's go!
It's noble, you wanting
to protect your friends
by keeping them out of this,
sooner or later they'll join us.
- It's a matter of survival.
- It's not gonna happen.
Mutant Underground's everything to them.
The Hellfire Club protected
mutants once, too, you know.
That's why we're trying to rebuild it.
We know what you're thinking,
but you have to remember,
- Marcos loves you.
- He'll come around.
Stay out of my head.
Kids.
Let's go. All right.
Come on, Zingo. Here. Good boy.
- All right.
- Sit in the back.
It's gonna be okay, sweetie.
You know where you're going?
Yeah. Rally point's Nashville station.
We'll follow as soon as we can.
Hey, good luck.
They're here!
Get out! Everyone inside!
We need the other van.
There's still more people.
Get inside. It's too late.
Let's go.
That's great. Let's do another.
Reed, we got to figure out what to do.
Well, this should hold
them off for a little.
Then what? We're trapped in here.
Look, if these people get caught,
- they'll end up as Hounds.
- We have to get them out.
But they'll have teams on all the exits.
What if we made a new one?
Maybe.
How about the southeast corner?
The vault... It's partially underground.
They're not gonna have cover
on that side of the building.
If we could get through there,
we might be able to get away.
- You think it could work?
- I think we have to try.
Okay.
Everyone, listen to me.
We're not gonna give up.
We're gonna fight.
And we're gonna get out of here today.
Now, I might not have
started out as one of you,
but I am now.
And I am telling you all,
we have a chance if we work together.
If you've been in combat
training, we need you up here.
Everyone else, help down
in the vault with me.
We don't have much time! Let's go!
This is Sentinel Services.
We've surrounded the building.
Surrender immediately.
I repeat, we have you surrounded.
Surrender immediately.
Everyone, grab what
you can! Clear a path!
You guys, come take this.
- Go.
- Got it?
Straight back in the other room.
Got another one!
Go ahead.
Okay.
Okay.
- Can you get through?
- I'll give it a shot.
I can't get through.
Foundation's reinforced.
Shatter!
Can you help us out here?
I got this.
Try again.
All right.
That's good. Just keep going.
Everybody, come help!
Pedro spotted them coming from the road,
which means they're
gonna focus on the front.
So our job is to stop them there.
- It's just us?
- All we have to do is hold them back
long enough until the
others get us out of here.
- There's no way.
- Skyler, it's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay if
we stand up and fight.
We got to remember what Polaris told us.
We stick together, we
watch each other's backs,
and we got this.
Naya, Skyler, you take the right.
Raghav and Zion and you two,
cover the back in case they come around.
Andy and Lauren... can
you two take that window?
I'm down if she is.
Remember, we're trying
to save this place,
not settle some score.
I'll fight my fight,
you fight yours. Okay?
On my go.
Move in.
We all go at once.
You ready?
Come on.
Wait for it.
First team in position.
Hold, hold.
Second team in position.
- Advance!
- Now!
Go!
Get 'em up!
We got gunshots at the center window.
Mutants on the left and right.
Damn it!
Just keep going!
Fall back! All teams fall back now!
Good job!
Okay, stay sharp!
Damn it! I should've known.
It's my fault. I should've stopped her.
Marcos, you couldn't have known.
It's not like her to do this.
It's not? John, ever
since we broke her out
of that convoy, you know
she's been different.
- And with the baby...
- I know she's had issues
in the past. Do you think that
- maybe this is...
- No way.
I've had friends who were bipolar.
Assassination plots are
not one of the symptoms.
She's right.
Lorna knows exactly what she's doing.
You sure you can do this?
I'm sure.
We're not just talking
about your powers.
I know what you're talking about.
- Your friends are coming.
- Okay, go.
They have to know I'm
not doing this for you.
Senator,
I am so pleased we're moving
forward on this matter.
Well, as I see it,
getting mutant criminals
off the street has to be the priority.
- We're saving lives.
- My feelings precisely.
How did you get into all this?
Thank you.
My brother had cystic fibrosis.
He suffered terribly.
I saw firsthand the
horror of genetic disease.
If it's just one person
or humanity itself,
I feel it's my calling
to ease their suffering.
I'll drink to that.
Yes.
Hounds are ready.
Once they breach, our
squads will follow.
If we're trying to take prisoners...
No, no, we're not taking any
prisoners. We're past that.
Our instructions are
to end this station.
That's exactly what
we're gonna do. Move in!
Move in.
Let's go.
Move.
That's good.
Just keep going. We got to get
it big enough to crawl through.
I'll get the others.
- Mom.
- Be careful.
We're almost through.
How's it going downstairs?
We're close. Just a few more minutes.
Well, that may be more than we have.
We managed to hold off the SWAT team,
but it looks like
they're bringing in the...
The Hounds are back!
You take this. And same as before!
Go!
Get down!
You okay?
Go to the kids. I'll cover you.
Everyone downstairs now!
Come on!
Come on.
It's working. They stopped resisting.
We got 'em.
They're getting in!
The barrier's not gonna hold for long!
We're through!
Okay, when you get
out, go down the hill.
Stay in the trees.
If they see us, they'll
know where we went.
- They'll catch us out there.
- Mom, Dad.
We can get everyone out.
- What are you talking about?
- If we destroy the building
after getting everyone out,
then we can cover our tracks.
- Everyone will be safe.
- Wait, wait.
Y-You know what that means.
Yeah, we know.
They're coming!
You did your part. Let us do ours.
This is not good-bye.
- We will see you outside.
- Come on.
If you meet any resistance,
end it.
Everybody out! Everybody out now!
Fall back! Fall back!
Go, go, go. Go.
Lorna!
Babe, we just want to talk.
There's nothing to talk about.
This is just something I have to do.
- Please stand back.
- We can't do that.
Whoa. Okay.
You're my friend, Clarice, but don't...
don't try to get clever.
And when we get to Washington,
we'll have a narrow path
to push this through.
There's still support for
so-called mutant rights
in some states.
That's why we came to you, Senator.
And I assume they'll remember my support
during the next
presidential primary season?
Yes, of course.
Listen, Lorna, you
don't want to do this.
Marcos, I have to.
- For all of us.
- No. No, you don't.
You saw what happened when
innocent people died on 7/15.
Not everyone on that
plane is trying to hurt us.
Innocent people... You
take it down, they die!
There are innocent
people on this side, too.
If I don't take it down, they die.
- You're wrong!
- You're not a killer, Lorna.
This isn't why the X-Men chose us.
The X-Men made a
mistake. This is who I am.
Please, just listen to me.
Now, we will figure this out.
I don't care about the X-Men.
I don't care about the Brotherhood.
I care about my family.
That's what I care about, too.
But I'm tired of hiding.
- We have to take a stand.
- Not like this.
This changes everything.
This will change everything.
Our kid has to live in this world.
It's time to make a new world.
No, Lorna, please.
Lorna!
This is your pilot.
Please fasten your seat belts.
We're experiencing engine trouble.
Prepare for emergency landing!
- What the hell is going on?
- I repeat,
prepare for emergency landing.
Don't do it! No, no, no!
Lorna? Lorna!
_

It was close, but we got everyone out.
If it weren't for Lauren and
Andy, we would all be dead.
- And headquarters?
- It's gone.
Gone? What do you mean,
gone? It can't just be gone.
I'm telling you, gone.
It just... I-I've never
seen anything like it.
No one got out but the Strucker kids.
You okay?
Uh, just...
we sacrificed so much.
Uh... any, uh, any word from Lorna?
Nothing.
I'm sorry.
You all right?
Just trying to wrap my
head around what happened.
- It was them or us. We had to.
- I know that.
They were mutants, too.
They didn't choose to be
there. Campbell made them.
We got out of that lab
in time. They didn't.
Lauren...
Hey, guys. I just want to say...
what happened today was hard.
But the fact is you
rescued all these people.
You, too, Cait.
I'm proud of our family.
We've reviewed the
operation, and so far,
I'd have to say, there
are grave questions
- about your judgment.
- My judgment, sir?
You launched this assault
without proper backup.
With all due respect,
I launched that assault
on your instructions.
My instructions were to
apprehend any terrorists
in a way that secured
the safety of our
agents and mutant assets.
Is this a joke?
We just got hit, and you're
looking for a scapegoat?
It's hardly a scapegoat,
and it's not just the
Mutant Underground.
We lost a United States
senator at the hands
of a mutant criminal
you failed to secure.
Had you been more careful,
both of these tragedies
- might have been averted!
- Tra-Tragedy?!
You're talking to me about tragedy?!
I sacrificed everything for this agency.
I suggest you calm down.
Yeah, I don't need
your damn suggestions.
While you...
you cowards sit here
covering your asses,
real people are dying out there.
Our country... our
species... Is under attack.
You want to play your little...
little bureaucratic
games? You go right ahead.
You can do it without me.
I quit.
Agent Turner. Agent Turner!
We need to start
thinking about next steps.
With the headquarters gone,
a lot of people have nowhere to go.
John, we know what we need to do.
- We need to rebuild.
- Rebuild what?
You heard Sage. The place disintegrated.
Not about a building.
It's about the network
and the people in it.
Everything we have is gone.
Restart from nothing? It's not possible.
Besides, anything that we build,
they're just gonna smash it again.
No.
That's not a reason to give up.
That's a reason to fight harder.
Listen, I get you trying to help,
but you're not even a mutant.
I am. And my children are.
And the Underground saved our lives.
If the Sentinel Services
comes after another family,
we owe it to them to be there.
I'm sorry, but the fact is
since your family came,
half our stations have been destroyed.
You can't blame us for that.
The Hound program was
coming one way or another.
Okay. Hey!
The X-Men didn't do this 'cause
they thought it would be easy.
They knew it would be a struggle.
They knew it would take sacrifice.
There's nothing noble
about struggle, Marcos.
And sacrifice is just a
pretty name for losing.
Lorna, what are you doing?
I'm telling them the truth.
The Mutant Underground is dying.
That world where we don't have to hide
that we've always talked about?
I want to build that.
For all of us.
For my baby.
That baby is ours.
And this is where your family is.
Lorna, you know I will do
anything for you, but...
I can't help you do this.
No one's asking for your help.
The people we're here for...
They know who they are.
What the hell does that mean?
What?
Fade? Fade.
Sage.
I'm sorry, John.
They ended the Hound program.
This is just about survival.
Guys.
You've got to be kidding me.
No. No way.
Andy, stay where you are.
You are not taking our son!
They're not taking me. It's my decision.
This thing they're trying to
rebuild, the Hellfire Club,
it's something that our
family was a part of.
And you're the one who's always
talking about helping people.
A war between humans and
mutants isn't helping anyone.
I can't let you do this.
I'm not asking.
What?
Andy.
When we were kids playing X-Men,
we did that... because they were heroes.
Because they saved everyone.
Please. Don't leave me.
The X-Men are gone.
We're not little kids anymore.
- Andy.
- Andy, no.
I'm-I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
I love you guys,
but you're my family, I
don't want to hurt you.
Don't try to stop me.
No.
No, no, no, don't. Don't.
