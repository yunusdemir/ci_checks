it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?

No, they didn't.

Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend

and he might not wake up.

A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what
you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
<font color="#808080">KILLIAN:</font> You know what my old man
used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but
the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that
one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>
<i>no one was even looking.</i>
<i>I had a thought that would
guide me for years to come.</i>
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you
the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.

I'm not sure if you can tell,

the body is trying to decide

I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point,

Honey, I can't reach any

All right?

I'll catch you, I promise.

I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.
Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.

Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain
about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

To be able to share

- Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
