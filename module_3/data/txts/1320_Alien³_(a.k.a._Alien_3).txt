Fire in Cryogenic Compartment.</i>
<i>All personnel report to...</i>
<i>Emergency Escape Vehicle Launch Pad.</i>
<i>Deep space flight will commence...</i>

An E.E.V.'s come down.
Get down to the beach.
There may be others.
NOW!
Talk to me.
All right, all right.
Let's get it going.
Keep it together.
Come on. Right.
Right. Here we go, Mr. Dillon.
Give us strength,
O Lord, to endure.
We recognize that we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.
Let the circle be unbroken...
until the day.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Thank you, gentlemen.
This is Rumor Control.
Here are the facts.
As some of you know...
A "337" model E.E.V...
crash-landed here at 0600...
on the morning watch.
There was one survivor...
two dead and a droid that was
hopelessly smashed beyond repair.
The survivor is a woman.
I just want to say that I
have taken a vow of celibacy.
- So have we all.
- That also includes women.
- Yes.
- We've all taken the vow!
- Shut your gob, Morse.
- I'd like to say, that I for one...
do not appreciate company policy
allowing her to freely...
intermingle with inmates
and the rest of the staff.
What brother means to say is we view
the presence of any outsider...
especially a woman,
as a violation of
the harmony...
a potential break
in the spiritual unity.
We are well aware of your
feelings in this matter.
You will be pleased to know that
I have requested a rescue team.
Hopefully, they will be here
inside of a week...
and evacuate her A.S.A.P.
<i>Don't give us that!</i>
What's her medical status?
She doesn't seem
too badly damaged.
She's unconscious.
Can't give you a more specific
diagnosis at the moment.
Will she live?
I would think so.
Look...
It's in everybody's interest...
the woman doesn't come out of the
Infirmary until the rescue team arrives.
And certainly not without
an escort, right?
Sir.
Gentlemen!...
We should all stick
to our set routine...
and not get unduly agitated.
- Right.
- Correct?
All right.
Thank you, gentlemen.
All right.
<i>Better get here sooner.</i>
- There ain't gonna be much left.
- Everybody's dead.
What's that?
It's just a little
cocktail of my own mix.
Sort of eye-opener.
You the doctor?
My name is Clemens.
I'm the Chief Medical
Officer here.
Here?
Fury 161.
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's
backwater work prisons...
it grieves me to say.
Do you mind?
This is basically a "stabilizer".
I really ought to
shave your head.
We have a big problem
with lice here.
And when you're feeling better,
I'll give you some clippers...
- And you can tend to your private parts yourself.
- How'd I get here?
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.
Evidently separated from your mothership
before you hit our atmosphere.
You have any idea how long
you were in hypersleep?
Coming out the way you did
can be a jolt on your system.
Yeah, I'll be sick
for a couple weeks.
Indeed.
Where are the others?
They didn't make it.
What?
They didn't survive.
I have to get to the ship.
I have to get to the ship.
You're in no
condition for that.
You wanna get
me some clothes...
or should I just go like this?
Given the nature of our
indigenous population,
I would suggest clothes.
None of them have seen
a woman in years.
Neither have I for that matter.
This used to be a
5,000 convict facility...
but it's been reduced
to a custodial staff of 25.
Why?
Keep the pilot light on.
The pilot light for what?
Blocked furnace.
Natural Methane.
We have a foundry,
Leftenant Ripley.
The inmates forge lead sheets
for toxic waste containers.
How do you know my name?
It's stenciled on the
back of your shorts.
<i>Release the cable!</i>
Where are the bodies?
We have a morgue.
We put them there until the investigative
team arrives in about a week, I think.
There was a droid.
Disconnected.
There were bits and pieces
of him all over the place.
We put what was left
on the rubbish tow.
The Corporal was impaled
by that safety support.
He never knew what hit him.
And the girl?
She drowned in her cryo-tube.
I don't think she
was conscious...
when it happened.
I'm... Sorry.
What's the matter?
Where is she?
In the morgue.
I have to see her.
I have to see
what's left of her.
Is there any particular reason
that you're so insistent?
Yes. I have to be
sure how she died.
I hate to be repetitious about
such a sensitive subject...
but it is perfectly clear
that she drowned.
Was she your daughter?
No.
She wasn't.
Um...
could I have a moment
alone, please?
Yes, of course.
Forgive me.
What's she doing?
Okay?
No.
We have to do an autopsy.
What?
I told you...
we have to make sure
how she died.
And I told you...
she drowned.
I'm not so sure.
I- I have to see inside of her.
You're disorientated.
Half your system's still in...
I have a very,
very good reason.
Well, perhaps you'd like
to share that reason.
Possible contagion.
What kind exactly?
Cholera.
Cholera?
There hasn't been a case of
cholera reported for 200 years.
Please.
Everything's in place.
There's no sign of infection.
No indication of disease.
The chest.
Open the chest.
Careful.
Lungs.
Flooded with fluid.
Ergo, she drowned.
Now...
since I'm not a
complete idiot...
would you like to tell me
what we're really looking for?
Mr. Clemens.
Superintendent.
I don't believe you've
met Leftenant Ripley.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?
That's right, sir.
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?
Well, first...
the Leftenant...
ia feeling much better,
I'm happy to say.
Second, in the interest
of public health...
I am performing an autopsy.
Without my authority.
Well, there didn't
seem to be time.
But it's turned out all right.
- There's no sign of contagion in the body.
- Good.
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't
parade around in front of the prisoners...
as I am told she
did in the last hour.
It might also be helpful...
if you kept me informed as to any
change in her physical status.
Or would that be asking too much?
We have to cremate the bodies.
Nonsense. We'll keep
their bodies on ice...
Till the rescue team arrives.
On ice.
There is the public
health issue.
The Leftenant feels that there is still
a possibility of a communicable infection.
I thought you said there
was no sign of disease.
It would appear
that the child drowned.
But without the benefit
of proper laboratory tests...
it's impossible to be
absolutely certain.
I would consider it unwise...
to tolerate even the possibility
of an unwelcomed virus.
An outbreak of...
cholera would look
extremely bad on a report.
Would it not, sir?
We've 25 prisoners
in this facility.
All double "Y" chromos.
All thieves, rapists, murderers,
child molesters.
All scum.
Just because they've taken on religion,
doesn't make them any less dangerous.
I try not to offend
their convictions.
I don't want to
upset the order.
I don't want
ripples in the water.
And I don't want a woman walking
around giving them ideas.
I see...
For my own personal safety.
Exactly.
I will leave the details of the
cremation to you, Mr. Clemens.
They may use the furnace, but I want
everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.
Recorded, sir.
Ah, Christmas has
come early, Murph.
What do you mean?
Any dead ox is a good ox.
You're bloody right.
Smelly bastard's
all covered in lice.
There's only seven of the friggin' things
left, and then we're done with them.
God, I hates hosin'
these bastards down.
I always get shite
all over me boots.
Sure we're gonna hose
these things down, Frank?
Yeah.
If you had the chance...
what would you say to her?
What do you mean,
if I got the chance?
You know.
If you got the chance.
You mean, casual like?
Yeah. I mean, how would
you put it to her if you...
bumped into her in the
mess hall or somewhere?
No problem!
I've never had any
problem with the ladies.
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear.
How's it goin'?"
Anything I could do
to be of service?"
Then I'd give her the look,
you know... Up and down.
And I'd give her the wink...
the dirty smile.
She'd soon get the picture.
Yeah, right.
And then she'd say...
"Kiss my ass,
you horny old fucker!"
I'd be happy to kiss her ass.
I'd be happy to kiss her
anywhere she wants.
Yeah, but treat 'em
mean, keep 'em keen.
Right, Frank?
Told you before, Murph.
Treat a queen like a whore...
and a whore like a queen.
You can't go wrong.
What do you think killed Babe?
Beats me!
She just keeled over.
How old was she?
The charts say 11.
In her prime.
Never mind.
We'll chop her up later
and throw her in the stew.
Right.
Hey, Frank.
What's this?
"We commit this child..."
"and this man to your keeping, O Lord."
"Their bodies..."
"have been taken from the
shadow of our nights."
"They have been released..."
"from all darkness and pain."
"The child and the man..."
"have gone beyond our world."
"They are forever eternal..."
"and everlasting."
"Ashes to ashes,"
"dust to dust."
Why?
Why are the innocent punished?
Why the sacrifice?
Why the pain?
There aren't any promises.
Nothing's certain.
Only that some get called,
some get saved.
She won't ever know
the hardship and grief...
for those of us left behind.
We commit these bodies
to the void...
with a glad heart.
For within each seed...
there is a promise of a flower.
And within each death...
no matter how small...
there's always a new life.
A new beginning.
Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
<i>I'll tell you...</i>
<i>it's fucking weird.</i>
<i>The only one to survive
that crash is a woman.</i>
<i>What trouble can she become?</i>
<i>She's already changed everything.</i>
<i>What the fuck are
we supposed to...</i>
<i>I mean it.</i>
Okay.
There's a lot of talk going around that
we've got some disharmony here?
Any you guys want to tell
me what the problem is?
Come on...
Speak to me, brothers.
All right. I'll tell ya.
I don't mind the dark.
I don't mind the bugs.
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold,
wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time.
I don't mind anything.
But I mind Golic.
That the way you feel about it?
Yeah. The guy's crazy
and he smells bad.
I ain't going out
with him anymore.
You got anything to
say for yourself?
Well, he's going with you.
Golic is just another
poor, miserable...
suffering son of a bitch
just like you and me.
'Cept he smells worse.
And he's crazy.
Knock off the shit!
You got a job to do.
I don't want to hear
another word...
about Golic.
Okay?
Okay?
Uh-oh.
As I thought, Mr. Aaron.
As I thought.
You called it, sir.
I just wanted to, umm...
say thanks for what
you said at the funeral.
My friends would have
appreciated it.
Yeah, well, you don't
wanna know me, lady.
I'm a murderer
and rapist of women.
Really?
Well, I guess I must
make you nervous.
You have any faith, sister?
Not much.
Well, we've got a
lot of faith here.
Enough even for you.
I thought women
weren't allowed.
Well, we've never
had any before...
but we tolerate anybody.
Even the intolerable.
Thank you.
That's just a statement of principle.
Nothing personal.
You see, we've got a good
place to wait here.
And until now...
no temptation.
What are you waiting for?
Huh!
We're waiting for
God to return...
and raise his servants
to redemption.
Dillon and the rest of the
alternative people...
embraced religion, as it were,
about five years ago.
Tempt you?
I'm on medication.
Hardly.
What kind of religion?
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian,
Christian fundamentalist, uh...
Right.
Exactly.
Point is, when the company wanted
to close the facility down...
Dillon and the rest of the
converts wanted to stay.
And they were allowed
to remain as custodians...
with two minders...
and a medical officer.
And here we are.
How did you get this
wonderful assignment?
How do you like
your new haircut?
It's okay.
Now that I've gone out on a
limb for you with Andrews...
damaged my already less-than-perfect
relationship with that good man...
and briefed you on the humdrum
history of Fury 161...
can you not tell me what you
were looking for in the girl?
You attracted to me?
In what way?
In that way.
Very direct.
I've been out here a long time.
So have I.
Yech!
Hey, Spike. Spike? Spikey!
Are you down there?
What are you doing?
I really appreciate
your affections...
but I am aware that they...
deflected my question.
In the nicest possible way,
of course.
You're spoiling the mood.
I have a job to do. Hmm.
I just want to know why we
had to cremate the bodies.
And now that I'm in your cot...
you think I owe you an answer.
I think you owe me an answer.
Being in my bed's got
nothing to do with it.
I had a terrible dream
in hypersleep.
And I had to be
sure what killed her.
Anyway, I made a mistake.
Possibly.
And now I've made
another mistake.
Really? What's that?
Fraternizing with a prisoner.
Physical contact.
It's against the
rules, isn't it?
Definitely...
When was this?
I think you know.
I'm not a prisoner.
You have a bar code on
the back of your head.
That does deserve
an explanation.
But I don't think
now is the moment.
Sorry...
We are rather spoiling
things, aren't we?
<i>Mr. Clemens.</i>
Mr. Aaron.
<i>Superintendent Andrews
would like you to report...</i>
<i>to vent shaft 22 on the
second quadrant now.</i>
<i>We've had an accident.</i>
Something serious?
<i>You could call it that.</i>
<i>One of our prisoners has been...</i>
<i>Diced.</i>
Sorry...
I have to go.
Official duties.
Who was it?
Murphy.
How do you know?
That's his boot.
I gave him the assignment, sir.
He was a wanker.
No apologies, Mr. Aaron.
It wasn't your fault.
Well, not much to say, is there?
Death was instantaneous.
No shit.
I take it he was
pulled into the fan.
A sudden rush of air,
I'd imagine, except...
Right. Almost happened to me once.
I've told him so many times,
"Stay away from the fans."
Nobody bloody listens.
Except the fan was blowing.
What's that?
I don't know.
I want to see you in my quarters in
30 minutes, if you please, Mr. Clemens.
Have you got any ideas?
Here you are.
You know, wandering around
without an escort...
is really gonna piss
Superintendent Andrews off.
Will you tell me
about your accident?
One of the prisoners
has been killed.
- Really?
- Emmm.
How?
In the air shaft.
Poor soul backed into
a nine-foot fan.
I found something at
the accident site...
just a bit away from
where it happened.
A mark.
A burn.
Rather like the one you found
on the girl's cryo-tube.
Look...
I'm on your side.
I want to help, but I need
to know what's going on...
or what you think is going on.
If you really wanna help...
find me a computer
with audio capabilities...
so I can access
this flight recorder.
We don't have anything
like that here.
Well, what about Bishop?
Bishop?
The droid that crashed with me.
I can point you in
the right direction.
I can't join you.
I have a previous engagement.
This'll clop you up.
Golic, don't fidget.
What's all this shit?
It's not properly wrapped.
What the hell does
he ever do right?
Eat.
He got that down pretty good.
Golic!
You light a candle
for Murphy. Please.
Plus thousands.
He was special.
Never complained about me once.
I loved him.
Is it true what they say?
His head split into
a million pieces?
Okay...
Who's got the matches?
Sit down, Mr. Clemens.
Thank you.
Sugar?
Uh, no thanks.
Milk?
Just a little, please.
Thank you, Mr. Aaron.
Listen to me,
you piece of shit.
You screw with me
one more time...
I'll cut you in half.
I'm sorry.
I don't think I understand.
At 0700 hours, I received
word from the network.
I may point out this is the first
high-level communication...
this installation has ever
received to my knowledge.
They want this
woman looked after.
They consider her to
be very high priority.
Why?
I have no idea.
But why did you let her
out of the Infirmary?
This accident with Murphy
is what happens...
when one of these dumb sons of a
bitches walks around with a hard-on.
I'm a doctor.
You're the jailer.
We both know
exactly what you are.
Sit down!
I think it might
be better if I left.
I find you...
unpleasant to be around.
You do? Isn't that lovely?
Consider this, Mr. Clemens.
How would you like me to
explain your sordid history...
to your newfound friend?
For her personal
edification, of course.
Now sit the hell down.
I don't like you.
You're unpredictable.
Insolent. Possibly dangerous.
You question everything!
If I didn't need
a medical officer...
I wouldn't let you within
light years of this operation.
I'm eternally grateful.
Keep your sarcasms to yourself.
Now, is there anything
I should know?
About what?
About the woman.
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens..
You spend every second
you can with her.
And I have my suspicions not all of
your concerns with her are medical.
Has she said anything to you...
Anything about where she's from,
what her mission is?
What the hell she was
doing in an E.E.V.?
She told me she was part of a
combat unit that came to grief.
Beyond that, I assume
it's all classified.
I haven't pressed her for more.
That's all?
That's all.
You're sure?
Yes.
Nothing more?
No.
Get out of here.
Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!
Shut up, you bitch!
Nobody's gonna hear you.
Goddamn it, let go of me!
Damn you!
No!
Hold still! Shh! Shh!
No! Goddamn it!
You okay?
Now, you son of a bitch!
Take off!
I gotta reeducate
some of the brothers.
We've gotta discuss
some matters of the spirit.
Aah!
Uuh!
Cigarettes!
Okay. Let's do it.
This is like 10 city blocks.
How many?
This makes 176.
Can't you chew
a little quieter?
I'm trying to figure out
how big this compartment is.
- I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making.
- You're not supposed to swear.
I'm sorry.
- Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once...
- Hey.
What?
What the shit is doing that?
You're swearing.
Shut up.
It's all right to say "shit."
It ain't against God.
What the hell is going on
with the candles?
Must be the wind from
one of the vent shafts.
Backwash from the closest
circulating unit.
If all the candles go out,
how we gonna know where we are?
Somebody will just have to
go back and relight them.
I guess I'm nominated.
Watch your step, brother.
Okay, who are the comedians?
Quick, grab it. Here.
Help me! Help me!
Go! Fuckin' go!
Go, go, go! Quick! Run!
Gimme that!
Get this fucking thing off me!
Oh, fuck!
Let me go!
No!
Hey.
Ah, Ripley.
Hi, Bishop.
How are you feeling?
My legs hurt.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.
It's okay.
I'm just a glorified toaster.
How are you?
I like your new haircut.
Bishop, can you access data
on the flight recorder?
No problem.
Golic?
I'm home.
What happened on the Sulaco?
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?
"Stasis interrupted."
"Fire in cryogenic compartment"
- "Repeat. Fire in cryogenic..."
- What happened?
What started the fire, Bishop?
Can you hear me?
The fire was electrical.
It was in the subflooring.
Did the sensors pick up anything moving
around on the ship prior to separation?
It's very dark here, Ripley.
I'm not what I used to be.
Just tell me. Does the
recorder indicate anything?
Was there an alien on board?
Yes.
Is it on the Sulaco or did it
come with us on the E.E.V.?
It was with us all the way.
Does the company know?
The company knows everything
that happened on the ship.
It all goes into the computer
and gets sent back to Network.
And they want it.
I'm hurt...
Do me a favour.
Disconnect me.
I could be reworked...
but I'll never be top
of the line again.
I'd rather be nothing.
You're sure?
Do it for me, Ripley.
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!
It wasn't... It was the dragon.
Feeds on minds. It was...
Nobody can stop it.
What about Boggs and Rains?
But they got s-slaughtered like pigs.
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!
Stark raving mad.
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault,
but he should have been chained up.
You called it, sir.
Mad as a fucking hatter.
Keep him separated
from the rest.
I don't want him
causing a panic.
Clemens...
Yes.
Sedate this poor idiot.
Not until we know
about the brothers.
No, now, pull yourself together.
Talk to me now.
- Now, where are Boggs and Rains?
- It wasn't me!
Hopeless. You're not gonna
get anything out of him.
- It wasn't me.
- We'll have to send out a search team.
I'm afraid we'll have to assume
there's a very good chance...
this simple bastard
has murdered them.
Now, you don't know that.
He's never lied to me.
He's crazy, he's a fool,
but he's not a liar.
He's telling the truth.
I'd like to talk to
him about this...
This dragon.
It was a dragon.
You're not talking
to anyone, Leftenant.
I'm not interested
in your opinion...
because you are not in full
possession of the facts.
This man is a convicted multiple murderer,
known for particularly brutal crimes.
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?
Yeah. That part's right.
Then I'll talk to you.
It's important.
When I have finished
with my official duties...
I will be quite pleased
to have a little chat, yes?
Let me see if I have
this correct, Leftenant.
It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,
with acid for blood...
and it arrived on
your spaceship.
It kills on sight and is
generally unpleasant.
And, of course, you expect me
to accept all this on your word.
No, I don't expect anything.
Quite a story, Mr. Aaron.
Right, sir. It's a beauty.
Never heard anything
quite like it, sir.
Expect not.
Tell me, Leftenant...
what would you suggest we do?
Well, what kind of
weapons have you got?
This is a prison.
It's not a good idea to allow
prisoners access to firearms.
What keeps them
from killing you?
Fear. There's no way to escape.
With the arrival of the
next supply ship...
the company
will eliminate them.
This is a maximum
security prison...
and you have no
weapons of any kind?
We have some carving
knives in the abattoir.
A few more in the mess hall.
Some fire axes scattered about the place.
Nothing terribly formidable.
That's all?
We're on the honour system.
Then we're fucked.
No!
You're fucked.
Confined to the Infirmary.
Quarantined.
Mr. Aaron will escort you.
I think you'll be safe from any large,
nasty beast while you're there, right?
Yes, that's a good girl.
<i>Let's all report to
the mess hall.</i>
<i>Superintendent Andrews
wants a meeting.</i>
<i>Mess hall, right away, people.</i>
Isn't there any way
off of this place?
Some way to escape?
No...
Supply ship comes
every six months.
And that's it?
Mm-hmm.
Fuck.
They are sending somebody to pick
you up quite soon, I gather.
Really.
What's soon?
I don't know...
Nobody's ever been in a
hurry to get here before.
Do you want to tell me what you
and Andrews talked about?
No.
You'll just say I'm crazy.
That's a bit uncharitable.
How are you feeling?
Not so hot.
Sore throat.
Sick to my stomach.
Pissed off.
Well, that's understandable
given the circumstances.
Perhaps I should give you
one of my special cocktails.
I don't know why everybody
blames everybody for everything.
Nobody's perfect, only human.
I don't know a perfect human.
There's no such thing
as a perfect human.
In an insane world...
a sane man...
must... Appear... insane.
That's very profound, Golic.
Thank you.
You married?
Me?
You should get
married, have kids.
Pretty girl.
I used to know lots
of them back home.
They used to like me.
For a while.
You're gonna die too.
Are you?
What?
Married.
Why?
Just curious.
No.
How about leveling with me?
Could you be more specific?
When I asked how you got assigned here,
you avoided the question.
And then when I asked about the prison
I.D. Tattooed on the back of your head...
you ducked me again.
It's a long, sad story...
and more than
a little melodramatic.
Try me.
If you insist.
After my student years...
despite the fact that I had become...
secretly addicted to morphine...
I was considered to
be most promising...
a man with a future.
And during my first residency,
I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.
So, I went out and I got
more than a little drunk.
Then I got called back.
Boiler had blown
on a fuel plant...
and there were 30 casualties.
And 11 of them died.
Not as a result of
the accident but...
because I prescribed the
wrong dosage of painkiller.
I got seven years in prison
and my license reduced to a 3-C.
At least I got
off the morphine.
I'm sorry.
I think I was let off lightly.
Did you serve your time here?
I got to know this
motley crew quite well.
So when they stayed,
I stayed.
Nobody else would employ me.
So...
do you still trust
me with a needle?
Magnificent.
<i>Give us strength,
O Lord, to endure.</i>
We recognize we are poor sinners
in the hands of an angry God.
<i>Let the circle be unbroken
until the day. Amen.</i>
- Amen.
- Amen.
What the fuck is
happening here?
What the fuck is this
bullshit that's comin' down?
We got murder. We got rape.
We got brothers in trouble.
I don't want no more
bullshit around here!
Now, we got problems,
we stand together.
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dillon.
All right.
Once again,
this is Rumor Control.
Here are the facts.
At 0800 hours,
prisoner Murphy...
through carelessness
on his part...
was found dead in
vent shaft 17.
He seems to have been
sucked into a ventilator fan.
At about 2100 hours...
prisoner Golic reappeared
in a deranged state.
Prisoners Boggs and
Rains are missing.
There seems to be a good chance that
they have met with foul play...
at the hands of prisoner Golic.
We need to organize and
send out a search party.
Volunteers will be appreciated.
I think it's fair to say that
our smoothly running facility...
has suddenly developed
a few problems.
I can only hope we are able to all pull
together over the next few days...
<i>until the rescue team arrives
for Leftenant Ripley.</i>
It's here!
It got Clemens!
- Stop this raving at once! Stop it!
- I'm telling you...
it's here!
Aaron, get that foolish woman
back to the Infirmary!
<i>Move it!</i>
<i>Out of my way!</i>
Fuck!
<i>We give you thanks, O Lord.</i>
<i>Your wrath has come, and the time
is near for us to be judged.</i>
The apocalypse is upon us.
Let us be ready.
Let your mercy be just.
That thing was
massive. - Amen. - Amen!
- I saw it.
- Yeah, I know.
What the fuck do we do now?
Who's in fucking charge?
Organize. We got
to organize, right?
Right. Well, I guess
I'm next in line.
85's gonna be in charge.
Jesus, give us a break!
Don't call me that.
Okay, look. There's no way
I can replace Andrews.
He was a good man.
I know you guys
didn't appreciate him.
Aaron, we don't want
to hear that shit now.
Hey, sister, what about you?
You're an officer.
How about showing us
a little leadership?
Forget fucking Shirley Temple.
You take charge.
- Right.
- You run things here anyway.
No fuckin' way.
I'm not the officer type.
I just take care of my own.
Well, what does
this fucking beast want?
Is this mother
gonna try for us all?
Yeah.
Well, ain't that sweet?
So how are we gonna stop it?
We have no weapons.
Is that correct?
Right.
I haven't seen one
exactly like this before.
Moves differently.
But the others
were afraid of fire...
Not much else.
Can we seal off this area?
No chance.
The installation's 10 miles square.
- There's 600 air ducts running to the surface.
- What about video?
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere.
We could try to find it that way.
The video system hasn't
worked in years.
Nothing much works here.
We've got a lot of technology,
no way to fix it.
- What 85 is trying to tell you is...
- Don't call me that!
We ain't got no
entertainment center,
no climate control...
no video system,
no surveillance...
no freezers, no fucking ice cream...
no rubbers, no women, no guns.
All we got here is shit!
Oh, what the hell are we
even talking to her for?
She's the one that
brought the fucker.
Why don't we just get her head
and shove it through the fucking wall?
Sounds good to me.
Morse.
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Hmm.
Right.
Right...
What are we going to do?
What's this?
Um...
that leads from the mess
hall to the Infirmary.
It's a ventilation shaft.
Then we go in there...
flush it out.
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles
and miles of tunnel through there.
It won't go far.
It'll nest in this area.
Right around...
Here.
How do you know that?
It's like a lion.
It sticks close to the zebras.
Zebras?
Oh, right.
But, look. Running around down here
in the dark... Are you kidding?
Once you get out of this main shaft,
there's no overheads.
Don't we have flashlights?
We've got thousands
of'em, but no batteries.
I told you, nothing works.
Torches?
Do we have the capacity
to make fire?
Most humans have enjoyed that
privilege since the Stone Age.
No need to be sarcastic.
Never been used...
They were gonna dump a
lot of nuclear crap in there.
Never got around to it.
It's clean as a whistle inside.
This the only way in or out?
That's right...
Walls are six feet thick...
solid steel.
<i>Really knew how
to build these babies.</i>
You're saying we get
something in there...
there's no way it can get out?
That's right.
No fucking way.
This is where we keep it.
I forget what the
stuff's called.
"Quinitricetyline"
I knew that.
Right. I've got to get these section
arrangements organized with Dillon...
for the paintbrush, uh...
So, um...
- David.
- Ya.
- Yeah. You can get these drums organized.
- Right, 85.
And, uh...
don't call me that.
What's this "85" thing?
A couple of us sneaked a look at
his personnel file the day he arrived.
It's his I.Q.
I saw a drum of this stuff...
fall into a beachhead
bunker once.
The blast put a tug in
dry dock for 17 weeks.
Great stuff!
All right. Let me get this straight.
You want to burn it down
and out of the pipes...
force it in here, slam the door...
And trap its ass?
Right.
And you want help from
us "Y-Chromo" boys, huh?
You got something better to do?
Why should we put our
ass on the line for you?
Your ass is already
on the line.
The only question is...
what are you gonna do about it?
Look at this.
There's only one of these fucking
batteries in 2,000 that works.
- Hey, it could have been a lot worse.
- Yeah.
We might have got
the paintbrush detail.
What is this stuff?
Man, this stuff stinks.
This shit smells awful.
Then don't breathe
the fucking fumes.
I'm in a fucking pipe with it.
How can I keep from breathing it!
I mean, don't breathe too hard.
You know, it...
it's good to me.
So you miss Doc, right?
What makes you say that?
I thought you two
got real close.
I guess you've been looking
through some keyholes.
That's what I thought.
Oh!
<i>Oh.</i>
You okay?
Yeah.
Whatever you say, but, uh,
you don't look
okay to me, sister.
I'm fine.
I hate this place.
I hate this place.
Wow.
There's definitely
something in here with us.
Okay. Don't light the fire
until I give the signal.
This is the signal.
Got it?
Can you remember that?
Aah!
Shit!
Help me!
Buh...
WAIT FOR THE FUCKING SIGNAL!
GET DOWN!
AAAHHHHH!
Come on, come on!
We gotta find the sprinklers!
Come on! We gotta help these guys!
Come on! Move! Move!
Get to the waste dump.
DON'T OPEN THE DOORS!
NO!!! NO!!!!
It's all right.
It's all right. You're
gonna be all right.
We got you.
FIRES OUT!
JUNIOR! JUNIOR!
Get down and cut him off.
We gotta get him out of here.
Come on. We're walking you out.
JUNIOR!
<i>BEHIND YOU!</i>
OPEN THE DOOR!
Come on!
COME ON!
COME ON!
COME AND GET ME, FUCKER!
<i>Even for those
who have fallen...</i>
this is a time of rejoicing.
We salute their courage.
<i>They will live forever.</i>
<i>Those that are dead, are not dead.</i>
They have moved up.
They have moved to a higher place.
Crazy bastards.
Andrews used to call
them Dillon's God squad.
Keeps 'em out of mischief.
You're not the religious type.
Me?
Shit, no. I've got a job.
Look, uh...
I figure the rescue team gets
here in four or five days...
six, tops.
Open the door...
Go in there with smart guns...
and kill it.
What have you heard from them?
Nothing much.
We got a message received.
And later, we got something
that said you were top priority.
They don't cut us in on much.
We're the ass end of
the totem pole out here.
What if they
don't want to kill it?
Take it back?
Yeah.
They're not lunatics, you know?
Gotta kill it.
Right?
Morse, please, cut me loose.
No fucking way.
Come on, man. It hurts.
Oh, sorry.
Come on. I haven't done nothing.
Just don't talk to me.
Please, what did I do? Please.
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do...
I'm gonna sit here and guard
your ass like I'm supposed to.
I don't need any fucking
trouble with Dillon.
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon.
What it did to Boggs and Rains.
I didn't lie.
You saw it.
Fuckin' "A" I saw it.
Oh, please.
If it gets in here,
I'm dead. I can't run.
Look, it's not going to get in here.
We've got it trapped.
So what's the big deal?
Come on. Let me loose, man.
Don't I always give
you cigarettes first?
Yeah.
Aren't I your friend?
I love you, Morse.
Why not?
But behave yourself.
No fucking around or
I'll get nothing but shit.
So where they got it?
In a waste tank.
We got that sucker nailed.
I mean, tight.
I gotta see it again.
What the fuck you
talking about?
No more cigarettes for you.
Well, we got the first part.
Now what do we say?
Tell them we trapped it.
Right.
What do we call it?
A "Xenomorph".
Right.
Spell it.
Here.
Hey, wait a minute. We can't kill it.
We don't have any weapons, right?
Right.
See? That's all
they ever tell us.
Treat us like shit.
Off and on me now?
What the hell you
talking about?
Talk to me, the beast.
You can't go in there, Dickens.
The big motherfucker
will eat you alive.
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.
Tell me what to do next.
So, you're telling me they're
coming to take this thing away?
Yeah, they're gonna try.
They don't wanna kill it.
We gotta figure out a way to
do it before they come here.
Why do we have to kill it?
You just said the
company's coming for it.
That's right.
They wanna take it back.
Some sort of weapon.
Yeah, what's wrong with that?
They can't control it.
They don't understand. It'll kill them all.
Like I said...
What's wrong with that?
Nothing's wrong with that...
except a lot of innocent
people will die.
I thought you were
a religious man.
You don't understand, do you?
That world out there
doesn't exist for us anymore.
We've got our own
little world out here.
It ain't much,
but it's ours.
So fuck everybody else.
No...
Fuck them.
Hey, Dillon!!!
Yeah?
Uh, Dillon...
We got a teeny-weeny problem.
Fucking great!
Miserable, crazy
son of a bitch let him loose.
Got what he fucking deserved.
Well, now what are we gonna do?
Andrews was right.
We should have kept
the shithead chained up.
You okay?
Piss on her. The fucking thing's loose out
there what are we gonna do?
I just said that.
And you're the dumb
prick that let Golic out.
You miserable little shit!
Come on. Cut that shit out.
Tell your fucking
bozo to shape up!
Wh-Wh-What do you think?
I think I have
to get to the E.E.V.
Why? What's up?
I just have to use
the Neuroscanner.
You don't look so good.
Who gives a shit? What
are we going to do?
Want a smack in the mouth,
you stupid wanker?
Shut the fuck up
and stop causing panic!
Panic... You're so fucking stupid,
you couldn't spell it.
Don't talk to me about panic.
We ought to fucking panic!
Shut up, both of you!
Shut up!
Well, I'm out of ideas!
Oh, surprise me.
What about outside?
Great idea.
The sun don't come up for another two days.
It's 40 below zero.
The rescue team's 10 hours away.
So that makes a lot of sense!
Wonderful. You just want us to stay here
and let this thing have us for lunch!
I want you to get everybody
that's still left together.
Get 'em into the Assembly Hall.
Okay.
Where'd she go?
Need any help?
I didn't mean to scare you.
You shouldn't be
wandering around alone.
Do me a favour and run
this keyboard, will you?
Okay.
What do I do?
Hit "B" or "C."
What's "C"?
"Display Biofunctions."
That's it.
Okay, we're hot. Now what?
Let it run a cycle.
It's real fuzzy.
Hit "enhancement".
Keep looking.
I don't know how
to read this stuff.
Hemorrhaging will show
as a dark patch.
Look for...
hairline fractures through
the base of the skull.
Little white lines.
What is it?
I think you've got
one inside of you.
That's not possible.
What does it look like?
Horrible.
I have to see it.
Freeze it.
You don't want to look at it.
Freeze it!
I'm sorry.
All right. The fucking thing is loose.
It's out there.
The rescue team is on its
way with guns and shit.
Right now there isn't
any place that's real safe.
But we stay here,
in the Assembly Hall.
This place never had any
fucking air conditioning.
If it comes in, it's gotta be through
one of these doors.
Now we post a guard
to let us know if it's coming.
In the meantime, you lay low,
be ready and stay right...
in case your time comes.
Don't you start
bullshitting, Dillon.
We're gonna be
trapped in here like rats.
You got a weapon? You got a blade?
Then you take it out and fucking use it!
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna
stab this motherfucker to death?
No, I don't think shit!
Maybe.
Maybe you'll hurt it before
it takes you out, huh?
Isn't that something?
Any of you got any better ideas?
And I'll tell you...
until the rescue team gets here,
we're fucked!
So you better get prepared.
Well, I ain't staying here.
Well, then, suit yourself.
Fire.
Furnace.
Yeah!
Let's make it to the furnace.
Holy shit.
Well, all right.
Fuckin' "A."
Fuckin' "A."
Fuckin' right it's right.
It's up...
What do you want to say?
Tell them the whole
place has gone toxic.
Are you kidding?
Then they won't come here.
The rescue team will turn back.
Yeah. I know.
What are you talking about?
Our only hope is that
they kill this fucker.
And maybe they can do
something for you.
I don't know, freeze you...
They can do an operation.
They've got the technology.
If this organism...
gets off the planet,
it'll kill everything.
The company doesn't
care about that.
They just want it...
for their Bioweapons Division, okay?
So we can't let them come here.
Fuck you.
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing
inside you, but I'm getting rescued.
I don't give a shit about
these stupid prisoners,
but I've got a wife,
I've got a kid.
I'll go home on
the next rotation!
I know. This is hard.
I'm gonna send this message back,
and I need that fucking code.
I'm sorry, babe.
It's classified.
Listen, you stupid little shit!
This has got to be done, okay?
There are no alternatives!
No way!
You're not getting it!
No fucking way!
Look, it's nothing personal.
Understand?
I think you're okay.
Thanks.
Have you got any ideas?
It won't kill me.
I'm carrying the new Queen.
It won't kill its future.
Do you wanna bet this
thing's that smart?
I don't know.
Maybe I'll go find it.
See how smart it is.
You're gonna go
and look for it?
Yeah.
I have a pretty good
idea of where it is.
It's just down there...
in the basement.
This whole place is a basement.
It's a metaphor.
Wanna come?
Fuck me.
Where are you when I need you?
Don't be afraid.
I'm part of the family.
You've been in
my life so long...
I can't remember anything else.
Now do something for me.
It's easy.
Just...
Just do what you do.
Oh!
It won't kill me.
What are you doing out here?
You're supposed
to be laying low.
I have one inside of me.
The big one won't kill its own.
What are you talking about?
I saw it...
an hour ago.
I stood right next to it.
I could've been lunch...
but it wouldn't touch me.
It ran away.
It knows I'm
carrying its future.
Aw, bullshit!...
How do you know that
thing's inside you?
I saw it...
On the CAT scan.
It's a Queen...
An Egg Layer.
It can make thousands more
like the one we've got here.
Still sounds like
bullshit to me.
If that thing's inside you,
how'd it get there?
When I was in
hypersleep, I guess.
I was violated.
Now I get to be the mother.
I don't have much time...
and I can't do what I should.
I need you to help me.
I need you to kill me.
What the fuck are
you talking about?
I'm dead anyway.
I can't survive it.
But the one inside of me
can generate thousands more.
It can wipe out
the whole universe.
It has to die.
So somebody's gotta kill me.
Are you up to it?
You don't have to
worry about that.
No speeches.
No prayers.
What's going on?
I don't like losing a fight.
Not to nobody, not to nothing.
That damn thing out there has
already killed half my men...
got the other half scared shitless.
As long as it's alive, sister,
you're not gonna save any universe.
You said you were
gonna kill me.
You fucking coward!
I want to get this thing,
and I need you to do it.
And if it won't kill you...
then maybe that helps us fight it.
Otherwise,
fuck you!
Go kill yourself.
Dillon.
We waste this thing...
Then you take care of me.
No problem.
Quick, easy and painless.
This is the choice.
You die sitting
here on your ass...
or you die out there.
At least we take a shot.
We owe it one.
It's fucked us up.
Maybe we can get
even for the others.
So how do you want it?
What the fuck are
you talking about?
I'm talkin' about killing
that big motherfucker!
Hold it, hold it.
The rescue team's on its way.
We could just sit this out.
A rescue team for whom?
For us.
They just want the beast.
You know that.
I don't give a damn
what they want.
They're not gonna pick us
off one by one, are they?
I wouldn't be so sure.
Come on. They're
gonna take us home.
They're not gonna take us home.
Still doesn't mean we
should go out and fight it.
Jesus Christ! Give us a break!
You guys have got
to be fucking nuts!
I've got a wife and kid.
Nobody gives a
shit about you, 85.
You're not one of us.
You're not a believer.
You're a fucking company man!
Yeah, okay.
Okay, I'm a company man
and not a fucking criminal.
You keep telling me
how dumb I am.
I'm smart enough not to have
a life sentence on this rock!
- Fuck you!
- Piss off, 85!
And I'm smart enough to wait for
some firepower to show up...
before we fight this thing!
- Right, Morse?
- Right. Okay. Just sit here on your asses. Fine.
How about if I sit here on my ass?
No problem.
Oh, I forgot.
You're the guy that's
made a deal with God...
to live forever, huh?
And all the rest of you pussies
can sit it out too.
Me and her'll do
all the fighting.
Okay. But I want
the same thing as you.
I want to see it dead.
I hate the fucker!
They killed my mates too!
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company
and have some guns on our side?
Why do we have to go on
some fucking suicide run?
Right.
Because they won't kill it.
They might kill you just
for having seen it.
But they're not gonna kill it.
That is crazy!
That is horseshit!
They will not kill us!
When they first heard
about this thing...
it was crew expendable.
The next time they
sent in the Marines.
They were expendable too.
What makes you think they're
gonna care about a bunch of lifers...
who found God at the ass end of space?
You really think they're
going to let you...
interfere with their
plans for this thing?
They think we're...
we're crud.
And they don't give a fuck
about one friend of yours...
that's... That's died.
Not one.
Have you got some sort of plan?
This is a lead works, isn't it?
All we got to do is lure the
fucking beast into the mold...
drown it in hot lead.
All right...
So how do we do that?
Yeah!
What are we gonna use for bait?
Oh, fuck!
We're all gonna die.
The only question is when.
This is as good a
place as any...
to take our first
steps to heaven.
The only question is
how you check out.
Do you want it on your feet...
or on your fucking knees...
begging?!
I ain't much for begging.
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.
So I say fuck that thing!
Let's fight it!
Fuck it!
Let's go for it!
- Let's kick its fucking ass.
- What if it runs at us?
That's a fucking good idea.
<i>Two, one. Open.</i>
When was the last time
you used this place?
We fired it up five,
six years ago.
You sure the piston's
gonna work?
There's nothing for
sure in this place.
We trap it here first,
then you pull the lever.
Start the piston.
And the piston's gonna push the
motherfucker right into the mold.
Then one of the guys
will pour the lead.
<i>End of his ass. End of story.</i>
What if somebody screws it up?
We're fucked. You
got one chance.
One shot at it. That's all.
We'll never have time to reset it.
Now remember,
when you pull the lever...
for a few seconds you're gonna be
trapped in here with that fuckin'thing.
You guys don't
drop the ball, I won't.
You just better be right about
that thing not wanting you.
Because if it wants out,
that's how it's gonna go.
Through that alcove, through you.
Where are you gonna be?
I'll be around.
What about the others?
Where are they?
Praying.
You believe in
this heaven shit?
I don't know.
Me neither.
Fuck it, though.
What else have we
got to believe?
You can say that
for fucking sure.
What the fuck.
FELLAS!!!
I can't...
Let's lunch this thing
I don't know about this shit.
HEY GUYS!!!
<i>MY DOOR AIN'T WORKING!</i>
What the fuck's he saying?
I think we'd better
rethink this thing!
DID ANYBODY HEAR ANYTHING?
COME ON!!! COME ON AND GET ME,
YOU FUCKER!!!
IT'S BEHIND ME!!!
It's started.
IT'S STILL BEHIND ME!
It's in Channel "B"!
IT'S STILL COMING!!!
SHUT THE DOORS
MUST BE HEADING TO CHANNEL "A"!
THIS THING IS REALLY PISSED OFF!!!
Did you say "B"?
No, "E"!
- But you said we should stay here!
- Move your fucking ass!
MORSE!
KEVIN!!!
I think I found Vincent!
Yoo-hoo!
Hey, fuckface!
Come and get me!
Take your best shot!
Kevin, where are you?
"A-7" closed.
Over in the east wing.
Door "B-7" safe!
You too?
YEAH OK!!!
OVER TO "E" EVERBODY!!!
WHERE THE FUCK IS "E"?
THIS WAY!!!
TROY! TROY!
HELP THEM!
Where the hell are they going?
What about the plan?
Look, you're immune,
they're not.
So what are we doing?
IMPROVISING!
We're improvising.
Great...
Here, here, kitty,
kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my...
YOU BASTARD!!!
IT'S COMING!!!
<i>IT'S COMING DOWN!!!</i>
GEEZ, IT'S COMING!
IT'S ONTO US! SHUT THE FUCKING DOORS!!!
THAT WAS THE PLAN!!!
GEEZ! IT'S ON THE FUCKING CEILING!!!
DILLION!!!
ANYBODY!!!
THIS IS NOT A DRILL!!!
KEVIN!!!
GREGOR!!!
WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU???
NOW I'M BACK IN "A"!
Shut. Come on.
Door 3...
"F" Channel closed!
I hope.
Fuck!
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
Don't hold it like that.
Hold it like this.
What the fuck...
You'll fucking kill someone,
you fucking moron!
MORSE!
KEVIN!!!
GREGOR!
All they have to do is run
down the damn corridor.
Stay here.
Where the hell is it?
<i>IT'S COMING!</i>
NO!!!
DON'T START THE PISTON!!!
NO! WE HAVE TO TRAP IT!!!

Wait.
They're here to help.
Stay where you are.
Ripley.
Bishop.
I'm here to help you.
No more bullshit.
I just felt it move.
You know who I am?
You're a droid.
Same model as Bishop.
Sent by the fucking company.
No...
I'm not the Bishop android.
I designed it.
I'm very human.
The company sent me here
to show you a friendly face...
to demonstrate how
important you are to us...
To me.
You just want to take it back.
We want to kill it and
take you home.
Bullshit.
You're wrong.
We want to help.
What does that mean?
We're gonna take
that out of you.
And keep it.
Can't allow it to live.
Everything we know
would be in jeopardy.
You don't want to take it back?
Ripley, time is important.
Let us deal with the mutant.
We've got a surgical bay
set up on the rescue ship.
Come with me.
It's very quick.
Painless.
A couple of incisions,
you'll be out for two hours.
Then it's over.
You still can have a life.
Children.
And most important,
you'll know it's dead.
Let me help you.
What guarantee do I have...
once you've taken it out,
you'll destroy it?
You'll have to trust me.
Please?
Trust me?
No.
What's this going to achieve?
Stop!
Ow! Oh, Jesus!
Morse.
Will you help me?
What do you want me to do?
It was a mistake!
There was no need
for any of it!
Fucking android!
I'm not a droid!
Ripley,
think of all we could
learn from it.
It's the chance of a lifetime!
You must let me have it!
It's a magnificent specimen!
No pictures!
What are you doing?
NO!!!
Come on, you. Get going.
Oh, fuck you!
