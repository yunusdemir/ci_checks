I got him.

How did I do?
<i>Excelente, mi amor. Excelente.</i>

Why are you so insistent?
I own the entire force,

I own the DEA, I own the Marshals.
Why can't I own you?
Why don't you take the money I offer you

What's your price?
Maybe I should ask your wife.

JONAS: <i>Thank you, pleasure to be here.</i>
<i>What steps are you taking</i>

<i>ICE is working with local law enforcement</i>

Get in.
MACHETE: $70 a day for yard work.
$100 for roofing.
$125 for septic. Sewage.
Have you ever killed anyone before?
(SIGHS) You know this guy?
Senator John McLaughlin,
Independent from Cocksucker County.
Built his reputation
on being a hardliner against wetbacks.
His words.
Yes, if he had his druthers,
he'd send you back to old <i>M¨¦xico.</i>
That's his platform, "Ship 'em all back,
"but first, make 'em build a wall
along the border for no pay.
"Thank you very much. Get the fuck out."
But what the senator fails to understand
is this state runs on illegal labor.
Thrives on it.
Keeps costs down,
keeps the wheels turning.
We bust that up and we're fucked.
My words.
Now, I'm guessing you don't have papers.
As you well know,
illegal immigrants like yourself
are being forced out of this country
in alarming numbers.
So, for the sake of both our peoples,
the senator must die.
And for that I will give you $150,000 cash.
Get someone else.
No time.
This job has to happen tomorrow.
I want you to take this cash,
do the job and disappear.
How long would it take you
to get this kind of money?
Five, 10, 15 years?
You could do a lot of good things with this.
You deserve it.
Now, I can't make you do this,
but I can make damn sure
something happens to you if you don't.
Are you in?
MICHAEL: Have a look at this.
Straight-line design,
laser-designated scope.
You can shoot the pecker off a mosquito
at 1,000 yards

if you wanna make a brutal point,
but it's low-tech,
completely unsuited to our purposes.

Here's your backup.

<i>Nobody. A day laborer from the streets.</i>
<i>He won't be missed.</i>
<i>Is he dead?</i>
<i>Dead or dying on a rooftop as we speak.</i>
<i>Which the fuck is it,</i> puneta?
<i>Dead or dying?</i>
<i>He'll be dead within minutes, I guarantee.</i>

- Is that him?
- Yes.
Doc Felix wants to see him.
(WHISPERS) Quiet.
Amazing.
You can see where the bullet rebounded.
It was stopped by another bullet
that was previously lodged there.
If he hadn't been shot before,
he'd be dead now.
There's actually a lesson
in there somewhere.
I can feel your eyeballs in my uterus.
Well, at least it's not in your colon.
Actually, did you know
that the human intestine
is 10 times longer
than the length of the body?
LISA: Wait, so the human intestine
is 50 feet long?
It's true.
FELIX: Ah! The hero has awoken.

Leave him alone.
Hi. What can I do for you?
What can you do for me?
I'm looking for a gentleman

Probably to ICU.
Where might I find him?
You wanna go straight down the hall

make a left, two rights, and another left,

You sure about that?
Mmm-hmm.
I'm gonna go this way.
Someone's coming.
We have to get him out of here.
- Is there another way out of here?

Oh! You don't wanna mess with that.

You need me more than I need you.
(LAUGHS) Come on.
You know all the cops in this state
are hunting you down
for trying to kill the senator.
I wasn't gonna kill him.
I was gonna shoot him in the neck.
Stop him from saying
all them stupid things.
It was a set-up.
There was another shooter there.
There was another shooter? Who?
(BRAKES SCREECHING)
Fuck!
(GASPING)

I know what they did to your family.
And if I were you, I wouldn't trust
anyone, either, but it's different here.
Laws are enforced.
And people control them, not drug lords.
The system works here.

I started working on the night shift,
taking out the trash.
But I worked my way up as translator,
assistant.
Now I'm special agent
in charge of investigations.
Sounds like they still got you
taking out the trash.
Let me take you in.
Put you into witness protection.
All you got to do is tell me who hired you
to take out the senator.
Fine.
SNIPER: Holy shit.
You mean to tell me
that a Mexican day laborer
is a goddamn <i>Federal?</i>
Looks like CIA, FBI, or DEA
all rolled in one mean fucking burrito.
<i>Is this the man you sent to kill Machete?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>
And so far, he's failed?
<i>So far.</i>
<i>I'm sorry to see you have such</i>
<i>a high tolerance for failure,</i> puneta.
I don't.
(CHOKING)
(LAUGHS) Mmm.
<i>How's that?</i>
Not bad.
<i>Last time we spoke,</i>
<i>you could've mentioned</i>
<i>he was an ex-</i>Federal, <i>God damn it!</i>
<i>Notoriously hard to kill.</i>
<i>Trust me, I've tried.</i>
Well, you didn't try
with the guy I'm calling in.
The very best the great state of Texas
has to offer.
Osiris Amanpour.
TORREZ: <i>If Machete is captured alive,</i>
<i>he'll expose my entire operation.</i>
You have 24 hours to take him down,
or I'm coming there myself
and I will kill him myself.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
(SIGHS)
Sorry, my friend.
<i>Mi abuelita</i> always said
you can solve any problem with food.
And you, my friend,
have plenty of problems.
So who are you working for?
Who wants the senator dead?
Is it the Network? Luz?
She doesn't know anything about it.
Network, either.
The man who hired me wasn't Mexican.
Really?
So he was just some random guy
who said,
"Hey, wanna kill the senator today?"
And you're like, "Cool."
I was afraid he wanted septic work.
Instead, he offered me $150,000
to kill the senator.
That's a lot of money.
So that's why you did it?
For the money?
Look, Machete,
you're not legal in this country.
And after what happened
to you in Mexico,
there is no way you're going home.
So, basically,
you're a man with no country.
Lucky for you, I can help you out.
Look at me.
I can get you papers.
But you gotta let me bring you in.
I'm gonna find the guy that did this
and bring him to you.
Why should I trust you?
Because we're both cops.
I'd tell you to stop,
but I know you took the bullets.
Luz!
Luz!
(SIGHS)
You didn't think they'd take me down
that easily, did you?
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
You're alive! But your house, man.
It's beginning, my little <i>chingones.</i>
I got something to show you guys.
Come on.
I told you they were gunning for us.
Who knows what they're gonna do next?
Holy shit, Luz.
I didn't know you were this loaded.
You got more heat than the po-pos.
LUZ: It's a good start,
but we'll need a lot more.
Need it for what?
<i>La revoluci¨®n.</i>
Von and his men are coming for us.
We need to be ready.
I'm not gonna be around forever.
If anything happens, you need
to tell Machete the people need him.
Who exactly is this Machete?
LUZ: That's him.
He's the one.
Hands up!
- Shit.
- SARTANA: Against the wall.
All of you. Move it.
Where's Machete?
Shit. She knows, man.
<i>La migra 's</i> gonna deport his ass back.
Nobody's deporting anybody.
Machete already told me you guys
weren't involved with the shooting.
Although
I should probably check your <i>carnitas</i>
for lead.
What is this place, anyway?
LUZ: Welcome to the Network.
These are some of the people I've helped.
Helped them cross, got them jobs
and I make sure they do their part.
And these?
These are the guys trying to stop us.
Von Jackson and his border vigilantes.
They started off with a couple of
deer rifles and a warped sense of justice.
And in the past year, they've grown.
More guns, more men.
Who's funding them?
LUZ: Whoever it is
is making a mess of our operation.
And these?
Missing.
LUZ: I have leads on a few of them.
They were supposed to have crossed,
but I have no way to track them.
- How deep does your operation go?
- LUZ: Deep.
All types, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, homeboys.
That's why they call it the Network.
The way we see it,
people risked everything to get here.
But the system doesn't work.
It's broken.
So we created our own.
So, <i>Migra,</i> gonna burn us, huh?
- Turn us all in?
- No.
I'm gonna walk away
and pretend I didn't see any of this.
Tell Machete I'm looking for him.
(CHURCH BELL TOLLING)
PADRE: <i>I am a man of faith.</i>
<i>I took a vow of peace.</i>
And I don't shoot anymore.
MACHETE: (LAUGHS)
You don't shoot any less, either.
I don't see you,
hear from you in three years,
and now you want me to help you
kill all these men?
Yes, Bro.
I mean <i>Padre.</i>
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
I'll see what I can do.
I want you to say 10 Our Fathers
and 10 Hail Marys.
Light a candle for Mama.
For funerals. A little side business.
I had these installed when too many
things started walking away
from the altar and collection plates.
Imagine if we had this kind of setup
when we were <i>Federales.</i>
PADRE: This is how you get the
bad guys now. You catch them on video.
Cuban?
Mexican.
Oh, yeah. I got some of that.
I got something I want you to see.
McLAUGHLIN: <i>Rest assured,</i>
<i>he will be caught.</i>
<i>This is the first shot of a war</i>
<i>that we didn't ask for...</i>
Nice way to find out
your brother's in town.
<i>... but these intruders, they mean to have.</i>
Right there.
<i>We can only hope that the perpetrator...</i>
That's the guy that hired me.
Michael Booth? (LAUGHS)
He's McLaughlin's aide, or some shit.
<i>... that the senator advocates</i>
<i>no form of violence.</i>
- You know him?
- (SCOFFS)
Yeah.
He comes in for confession all the time.
Lot of impure thoughts. (CHUCKLES)
Mostly about his daughter.
I guess I'm cheaper than a shrink.
Here's his file.
Once he started talking about
his connections to the cartels,
I figured it'd come in handy.
I bet McLaughlin doesn't even know
that most of Booth's businesses

What I don't understand is, why would
he hire you to kill his own boss?
Don't know.
Gonna find out.
It's not safe for you to be here.
I'm not looking for safe.
No, I mean it's not safe for me

I absolve you of all your sins,

Okay, Bro.

Hey. Hey, boss.
Who are you?
The new gardener.
The gardener?

I'm just fucking with you, chief.
It's Hungarian for
"I'm gonna kill you, you little monkey."
You know what?
There's a big pile of shit in the back.
You can go and clean that up, all right?
Just make sure you do a good job.
Make sure you wipe those boots off.
Don't want you carrying shit in the house.
You ever notice
how you let a Mexican into your home
just because he's got gardening tools?
I mean, no questions asked.
You just let him right in.
He could have, you know,
a chainsaw or a machete.

Don't call me on this line again.
I'll call you.

The war's begun. Helter Skelter's here.
Your army awaits further orders.
Well, gotta be respectable now.
No shit stains.
BILLY: What about the shooter?
He's still out there.
(SIGHS)
There's nothing I'd like more

But he's gone underground for sure.
Well, I say we go underground
and get him.
Find the Network
and you'll find the shooter.
Call our special friend.
Tell him we're gonna need
a hell of a lot more firepower
if he's serious about
wanting that border shut down.
I fixed your damn gun.
Oh. Thanks.
Our friend is up.
(SPEAKING SPANISH)
Where the fuck have you been?
You could've at least texted me.
Machete don't text.
But Machete gets evidence.
Thanks for coming back.
MICHAEL ON COMPUTER: <i>There's no way</i>
<i>McLaughlin is getting elected</i>
<i>unless something big happens.</i>
<i>Can you imagine</i>
<i>if someone shot the senator,</i>
<i>and that someone was a Mexican?</i>
<i>The public would elect him President.</i>
<i>It's not a sin if someone clips the senator</i>

So this is footage

<i>There's no commandment against,</i>

They're encrypted.

SARTANA: Holy shit.
You were right.
The Network isn't behind it.
This is something a hell of a lot bigger.
You've got enough here
to bring down everyone.
The senator, Booth.
Von.
Look, here.
There's Mexican drug money financing
the senator's campaign.
"Rogelio Torrez"?
Torrez.
He's the drug kingpin who's been trying
to gain control of the drug trade.
This must be the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.
(ELECTROCUTING)
See this?
These markings show the weakest spots.
It all makes sense now.
Torrez wants to get
Senator McLaughlin re-elected
so that he can build a border fence
that he can control.
You did good work, Machete.
I bet you were a great cop.
The best.
And modest, too.
I'm dry.
Oh.
Get up.
Why?
Because you're drunk.
Come lay with me.
(LIGHTER CLICKING)
<i>Habla ingl¨¦s?</i>
Depends on the question.
We know you hired that Mexican
to kill our senator.
You're the Network, ain't you?

That's not how we work.

MICHAEL: That's right.
We have to get the senator re-elected,
and get that fence built along the border
before it's too late.
- You really hate our kind that much?
- No, <i>Padre.</i>
I hate declining profits that much.
An open border allows supply
to flow in too easily.
Drives our prices down.
A secure border limits supply,
drives the prices up.
Higher prices, higher profit.
You're so drunk with power,
you even put a hit on your own boss.
(PADRE GROANING)
