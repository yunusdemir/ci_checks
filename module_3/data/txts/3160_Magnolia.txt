NARRATOR: In The New York Herald,
November 26, year 1 91 1 ...
...there is an account
of the hanging of three men.
They died for the murder
of Sir Edmund William Godfrey...
...husband, father, pharmacist,
and all-around gentleman resident...
...of Greenberry Hill, London.
He was murdered by three vagrants
whose motive was simple robbery.
They were identified as Joseph Green...
...Stanley Berry...
...and Daniel Hill.
Green, Berry, Hill.
And l would like to think
this was only a matter of chance.
As reported in the Reno Gazette,
June of 1 983...
...there is the story of a fire...
...the water that it took
to contain the fire...
...and a scuba diver
named Delmer Darion.
Employee of the Nugget Hotel and Casino,
Reno, Nevada...
...engaged as a blackjack dealer,
well-liked and well-regarded...
...as a physical, recreational,
and sporting sort...
...Delmer's true passion was for the lake.
As reported by the coroner,
Delmer died of a heart attack...
...somewhere between the lake
and the tree...
...but most curious side note is the suicide
the next day of Craig Hansen...
...volunteer firefighter,
estranged father of four...
...and a poor tendency to drink.
Mr. Hansen was the pilot of the plane...
...that quite accidentally
lifted Delmer Darion out of the water.
Added to this,
Mr. Hansen's tortured life...
...met before with Delmer Darion
just two nights previous.
All l need is a two.
All you need is a deuce. All right.
That is an eight.
DELMER: Glad you like my work.
All right. Moment of truth--
NARRATOR: The weight of the guilt
and the measure of coincidence so large...
...Craig Hansen took his life.
[GUNSHOT]
And l am trying to think
this was all only a matter of chance.
The tale told
at a 1 961 awards dinner...
...for the American Association
of Forensic Science...
...by Dr. John Harper,
president of the association...
...began with a simple suicide attempt.
JOHN:
--curiosity.
NARRATOR:
Seventeen-year-old Sydney Barringer...
...in the city of Los Angeles
on March 23rd, 1 958.
The coroner ruled
that the unsuccessful suicide...
...had suddenly become
a successful homicide.
To explain,
the suicide was confirmed by a note...
...in the right hip pocket
of Sydney Barringer.
At the same time young Sydney stood
on the ledge of this nine-story building...
...an argument swelled
three stories below.
[MAN AND WOMAN SHOUTlNG]
The neighbors heard, as they usually did,
the arguing of the tenants...
...and it was not uncommon for them
to threaten each other with a shotgun...
...or one of the many handguns
in the house.
FAYE:
l'm gonna put you down!
NARRATOR: And when the shotgun
accidentally went off...
You asshole!
NARRATOR:
Sydney just happened to pass.
What?
Shut the fuck up!
NARRATOR: Added to this,
the two tenants turned out to be...
...Faye and Arthur Barringer...
...Sydney's mother and Sydney's father.
When confronted with the charge...
...which took some figuring out
for the officers on the scene of the crime...
...Faye Barringer swore
she did not know the gun was loaded.
l didn't know.
She always threatens me with the gun,
but l don't keep it loaded.
DETECTlVE:
And you didn't load the gun?
Why would l load the gun?
NARRATOR:
A boy who lived in the building...
...sometimes a visitor
and friend to Sydney Barringer...
...said that he had seen, six days prior,
the loading of the shotgun.
Ricky, come here a minute.
NARRATOR:
lt seems that all the arguing and fighting...
...and all of the violence
was far too much for Sydney Barringer...
...and knowing his mother
and father's tendency to fight...
...he decided to do something.
[GUN CLlCKS]
He said that he wanted them
to kill each other...
. ..and that's all that they wanted to do,
kill each other. . .
. ..and that he would help them do that
if that's what they wanted.
NARRATOR: Sydney Barringer jumps
from the ninth-floor rooftop.
His parents argue three stories below.
Her accidental shotgun blast
hits Sydney in the stomach...
...as he passes
the arguing sixth-floor window.
He is killed instantly,
but continues to fall...
...only to find, five stories below,
a safety net installed three days prior...
...for window washers
that would've broken his fall...
...and saved his life
if not for the hole in his stomach.
So Faye Barringer was charged
with the murder of her son...
...and Sydney Barringer noted
as an accomplice in his own death.
[FAYE GRUNTlNG]
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator...
...that this is not
just something that happened.
This cannot be one of those things.
This, please, cannot be that.
And for what l would like to say,
l can't.
This was not just
a matter of chance. Ha, ha.
[FAYE SHOUTlNG]

There's no disturbance.

You don't tell me. l know my rights.

. ..besides me
and besides you in this house?
-No. l said that already.
-Mm-hm.
-Are you lying to me?
-l live by myself.
That might be true,

ls there anyone else
in this house right now?
-No.
-Okay.
-What is your name?
-Marcie.
Okay. Marcie,
l'm gonna need you to take a seat here.
-l prefer to stand up.
-Okay. l'm not asking.
-l didn't even do nothing.
-Move, ma'am.
[MARClE SlGHS]
Okay. So, like l was saying,
l'm here to check on a disturbance.
Now, some of your neighbors
heard screaming and a loud crash.
-l don't even know no loud crash.
-Okay, what--?
[METAL CLANKS]
-What was that?
-Nothing.
-Sit back down on the couch.
-l ain't gotta do a goddamn thing.
-What's this bullshit?
-Do not do this.
-Do not do this. Do not slap me, ma'am.
-This is bullshit. This is bullshit.
This is bullshit. For what? For what?
For what? Huh? Tell me for what.
No, tell me for what.
JlM: l asked you to sit on the couch.
MARClE: This is bullshit.
[MARClE GRUNTS]
This is bullshit. This is fucking bullshit.
1 5-L-27, l'm gonna need backup.
What the fuck is this?
lt's bullshit, motherfucker!
-l want you to stay right there.
-Fucking bullshit, and you know it!
JlM: Stay right there, Marcie.
-Don't you go in my bedroom!
This is bullshit, motherfucker!
Don't go down the hallway!
Don't go down
my motherfucking hallway!
JlM:
This is the LAPD!
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!
JlM:
Come out now with your hands up!
MARClE:
What did l tell you? Ain't nobody in there!
Where the fuck you going, motherfucker?
Don't go in my goddamn bedroom!
Stay out of my motherfucking closet!
What did l tell you?
-Don't go down my hallway!
-This is the police!
lf there is anyone in this closet,
come out...
. ..and show yourself to me now,
with your hands up.
Marcie, do not drag
that couch any further!
Don't do this, ma'am!
There's nobody
in my motherfucking closet!
lf l have to open this closet,
you will get shot!
MARClE: Come back here!
Come back here, motherfucker!
What can't you
goddamn fucking talk to me?
-There's nobody in there! l told you!
JlM: Marcie, quiet down!
MARClE: This don't make no fucking sense!
This don't make no goddamn sense!
This is bullshit, motherfucker!
Why can't you talk to me?
Whoa! Whoa-ho!
What the hell is this, Marcie?
That ain't mine.
LlNDA: He's dying.
He's fucking dying as we're sitting here.
There's not a fucking....
Jesus, how can you tell me
to calm down?
l can help you through this,
but there's certain things...
. ..you're gonna have to take care of,
and we can go over them...
. ..but l need to know
that you're listening to me, okay?
l'm-- l'm in a fucking state.
lt's like he's going, and l don't--
Just tell me practical things,
like what the fuck do l do with his body?
What do l do when he dies? What next?
What happens then? What next?
That's what Hospice can take care of.
They'll send over a nurse,
somebody who--
No. Phil. He has Phil now.
-Phil is one of the nurses from the service?
-Yeah.
lf you're happy with Phil taking care
of him and helping you, that's fine...
. ..but contact Hospice
to arrange for the body.
You don't understand. lt's--
There's more pain than before, and
the fucking morphine pills aren't working. . .
. ..and it's like-- The past two days,
he can't really swallow...
. ..and l , um-- l don't know
if the pills are going down.
l can't see inside his mouth anymore,
and l'm up all night staring at him. . .
. ..and l don't know if the pills
are going down. He moans and he hurts.
We can fix that, because l can give you--
Are you listening?
-Yeah. l'm listening. l'm getting better.
-Do you wanna sit down?
l need to sit down.
Okay, Linda, Earl's not gonna make it.
He's dying. He is.
He's dying very, very rapidly.
The thing here
is to make this experience. . .
. ..as painless
and easy for him as possible.
You understand?
Now, Hospice will take care
of all the technical things.
They will help you.
They will take care of the body.
They are who you call when he dies.
There's the number of Hospice.
Okay. Now,
as far as the morphine pills go. . .
. ..there's something else to consider.
There's a very strong,
very potent solution of liquid morphine. . .
. ..and it's a little bottle.
lt has an eyedropper.
lt's easy to get into his mouth
and drop on his tongue...
. ..and it will certainly diminish the pain
that he's in.
But you need to realize
that, uh, once you give it to him...
. ..there really is no going back.
lt will certainly cure his pain, but he will
drift in and out of consciousness. . .
. ..even worse than he is now, Linda.
l mean....
All sign of the recognizable Earl
will pretty much go away.
l-- What the fuck can l say to--?
l don't know what to say to that.
l don't want to do this.
Sit here.
l can see the things, you know.
lt's getting there, that's the cocksucker.
l see that pen.
l see it. l know it's there.
l reach for it.
No.
No. No goddamn use.
[SlGHS]
l have a son, you know.
-You do?
-Yeah.
-Where is he?
-l don't know.
l mean...
. ..he's around, but....
He's here in town,
but l don't know.
You know. . .
. ..he's a tough one.
Very. . . .
-Got a girlfriend, Phil?
-No.
-Get a girlfriend.
-l'm trying.
Do good things with her.
Share the things.
-All that bullshit is true, you know.
-Yeah.
Find a good one, hold on, and all that.
Where's Linda?
She went out. She, uh, said
she went out to run some errands.
-She'll be back.
-Oh.
-She's a good girl.
-Yeah.
She's a little nuts. Heh.
But she's a good girl, l think. Yeah.
-She's a little daffy. Yeah.
-Yeah.
She loves you.
Well, maybe.
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
She is a good one.
When's the last time
you talked to your son?
l don't know.
Ten.
Maybe ten. . . . Five....
Fuck.
[SOBS]
Fuck.
That's another thing that goes.
-Your memory?
-Time lines, you know?
l can remember things,
but not right there.
-You know?
-Yeah.
"Yeah"? What the fuck do you know?
-l've seen it before.
-Oh, other fucking assholes like me?
-Ah, there's no asshole like you.
-Cocksucker.
[PH lL CHUCKLES]
How come every word you use
is either cocksucker, shit balls, or fuck?
-Do me a personal favor.
-Go fuck myself.
-You got it.
-Ha, ha.
[EARL COUGH lNG]
[EARL GROANS]
l can't....
l can't hold on to this any longer.
-l'll get another pill. Another morphine pill.
-No. Give me the fucking phone.
-Who you gonna call?
-l wanna see this. l, uh--
-Where is he? Do you know?
-Who?
-Jack.
-ls Jack your son?
Do you want to call him on the phone?
l can call him.
l can dial the number
if you can remember the number.
lt's not him.
lt's not him. He's a fucking asshole.
Oh, Phil, come here. This is so boring.
So goddamn.. . . Goddamn. . ..
You know, that dying wish. . .
. ..and all that old man on a bed. . ..
-Wants one thing.
-lt's okay.
Find him on a. . . .
Frank.
His name is Frank Mackey.
-Frank Mackey?
-Yeah.
That's your son?
Not my name.
[EARL SlGHS]
Go find. ..
Find Lily.
Give me that. Give me.

With a chip on your shoulder
Except you think you got a grip
'Cause your hip got a holster

Finish it up without the lip.
Check that ego
Come off it, l'm the prophet

Who eventually turned to catch wreck
With the neck of a long-time oppressor
And he's running from the devil
But the debt is always gaining
And if he's worth being hurt
He's worth bringing pain in
When the sunshine don't work
The good Lord bring the rain in
Now, that shit

The kind of love that makes you feel
that intangible joy. . .
. ..in the pit of your stomach...
. ..like a bucket of acid
and nerves running around...
. ..and making you hurt
and happy and all over. ..?
You're head over heels?
You lost me with the last couple
of cocktail words spoken, my boy. . .
. ..but l believe it's that sort of love.
Sounds nice to me.
l have love.
Hmm, a very chatty kind.
lndeed you do, it seems.
No, l mean, l'm telling you.
l'm telling you, l have love.
Yes, and l'm listening avidly, fellow.
My name is Donnie Smith,
and l have lots of love to give.
-Hello.
-Hi.
Wow.
Lot of stuff here, huh?
[BOTH SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
lt's 30 seconds.
[BELL RlNGS]
--eye on you. l'll be back.
-Hi, Cynthia.
-Jakety, Jakety.
RlCHARD:
The fuck is going on over there?
-l gotta go to the bathroom.
-Jesus Christ, Stanley.
No, no, no. You cannot do that.
Let me explain something to you people.
You have to tone it.
Don't be real aggressive like that.
Be subtly abusive
so they don't know what's happening.
You say, "You're not gonna go outside
and play with your friends. ..
. ..until that entire room
is cleaned floor to ceiling."
Oh, Julia's room's the same way.
JULlA'S DAD: Like a pigsty.
But it's the outfits we're into now.
Oh, you should have seen what she had on
walking out the door.
l said, "No. We're going to school,
not a fashion show."
RlCHARD'S MOM:
lt's not a fashion show. lt's school.
JULlA'S MOM:
Absolutely. lt's not a fashion show.
Shh.
Let's make
some fucking money here, people.
You with me, Jimmy?
JlMMY: The book says,
"We may be through with the past.. .
. ..but the past ain't through with us."
[AUDlENCE CHEERlNG]
We met upon the level,
and we're parting on the square.
ln my fucking sleep, Burt.
And five, four, three, two. . ..
Live from Burbank, California,
its What Do Kids Know?
Going into our 33rd year on the air,
it's America's longest-running quiz show. ..
. ..and the place where three kids
get to challenge three adults. . .
. ..and in the end,
we'll see who's the boss.
Moving towards their
eighth consecutive week as champions. . .
. ..we have the kids:
Richard, Julia, and Stanley.
And our new adult challengers today
are Mim, Luis, and Todd.
And me, l'm Dick Jennings...
. ..and now say hello to your favorite host
and my boss...

[ALL CHEERlNG]
Back again, again, again.
l'm Jimmy Gator, and believe it or not...
...we are at the end of Week 7,
heading towards Week 8...
...with these three incredible kids, who--
Hello, hello.
--are just two days and two games away
from the What Do Kids Know? record...
...for the longest-running quiz show
in television history.
Now, we are, as you know,
endorsed by the PTA...
...and the North American
Teachers' Foundation.
We keep our standards high, and that's why
we are the longest-running quiz show...
...in television history. l wanna say
something about these kids now.
These kids right here,
I think they're gonna be here a while.
But today is a dangerous day...
...because l have just met
with the adult challengers backstage...
...and let me tell you,
they are a terrific challenge for our kids.
So let's get this show up and away,
shall we?
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDS]
DETECTlVE:
We wanna know where your son is.
"Jerome Samuel Hall." Did he fight
your husband? ls this the Worm?
DETECTlVE: They had a fight. An accident.
OFFlCER: They call him Worm?
DETECTlVE:
We wanna know where your son is.
-Help us, Marcie.
-Do they call him Worm?
-Help us help your son, Marcie.
OFFlCER: Do they call him Worm?
DETECTlVE:
Help us help your son, Marcie.
OFFlCER: Your son and your grandson.
Help us help them.
ls this the Worm?
[DOOR OPENS]
JlMMY [ON TV]:
Let's jump right in.
A quick recap for those who don't know.
Round One.
Three categories. Steals are okay.
Point scale escalating from 25 to 250,
one of which is a conversation bonus.
[DOORBELL RlNGS]
[DOGS BARKlNG]
-Hi.
-That'll be 31 .90.
The categories are "authors,
chaos versus superstring, and rub-a-dub."
[DOGS BARKlNG]
-Max. Thanks.
-Bye.
Adults won a coin toss backstage,
so they get to pick first.
Team captain: Mim.
[DOGS BARKlNG]
First question, for 25.
This female author's most famous work:
O Pioneers!
PH lL:
H-E-R.
[BUZZER RlNGS]
JlMMY: Stanley?
-Willa Cather.
Willa Cather for 25.
Best known for the tragedy-of-blood genre,
this playwright--
[BUZZER RlNGS]
-Stanley.
-Thomas Kyd.
Thomas Kyd.
This French playwright and actor
joined the Bejart troupe of actors--
[BUZZER RlNGS]
-Stanley.
-Moliere.
Oh, l'm afraid l'm gonna need
a full name, Stanley.
Jean Baptiste Poquelin Moliere.
What the fuck is this?
God damn. My little fucker.
Ha-ha-ha!
l have no idea where he gets this shit.
He's a fucking genius, really.
CHAD [OVER PHONE]:
Seduce and Destroy. This is Chad.
Can l have your phone number?
-ls this Seduce and Destroy?
-Yes, it is. Can l have your phone number?
Okay, l don't want to order anything.
Uh, you see... .
l have a situation, uh, that's just come up
that's really pretty serious.. .
. ..and l don't know who to talk to
or what l should do. . .
. ..but maybe you could put me in touch
with somebody if l explain myself?
Uh, we're really only equipped
to take orders here, sir.
l mean, it's just us with the phones,
and that's what we do, you know--
Okay, okay, okay. Could you connect me
with somebody else, you think?
Well, what's the situation?
Okay, great, um. . . .
All right. Let me try to explain myself
without it seeming crazy.
But here l go. l'm-- No.
Uh, my name is Phil Parma. . .
. ..and l work for, uh, a man
named Earl Partridge.
Uh, Mr. Earl Partridge.
l'm his nurse, and he's a very sick man.
He's a dying man, and he's sick...
. ..and he has asked me to help him.
To help him find his son.
-Hello? Are you there? Hello?
-No, l'm here. l'm listening.
Okay. Um, you see...
. ..Frank T.J. Mackey
is Earl Partridge's son.
So where are you from originally?
FRANK: From around here.
-Valley?
-Well, Hollywood, mainly.
-What did your parents do?
Uh, my father-- Well, he was in television.
My mother--
-This is going to sound silly to you.
-Try me.
-Uh, she was a librarian.
-Why does that sound silly?
l don't know. l guess it doesn't.
-Does your mother still work?
-No, she's retired.
-Are you close?
-She's my mother.
Yes, but, uh, l mean,
she's a woman too. . .
. ..so how does she feel
about Seduce and Destroy?
l mean, what does she say?
[FRANK LAUGHS]
Well, she says, uh,
"You go get them, honey."
Uh-huh.
And what about your father?
Oh, my father.
Unfortunately, he passed away.
-Oh, l'm sorry. l had no idea.
-No, please.
l wouldn't have brought that up
if l had known.
-That's a very hard thing.
-Please.
Yes, it is, but listen.
l mean, you have to move forward.
The past has its place.
-lt was a long time ago, and people die.
-Yeah.
Okay, let's switch gears here. Um....
According to your book,
you ended up at UC Berkeley?
'84 to '89.
-Psychology major.
-That's right.
-Get your masters?
-Hmm? Oh.
-This close.
Wow .
-That's impressive in five years.
-Cap, can l have some coffee?
Can l get you anything?
-No, no, no, l'm good. Thank you.
-You sure? Okay.
-She's good. l need coffee.
-Ha, ha.
PHARMAClST:
Cats and dogs out there, huh?
Must have a lot going on
for all that stuff back there, huh?
You could, uh....
Heh. You could have quite a party,
all that stuff.
You been on Prozac long? Dexedrine?
-l don't. . . .
-lnteresting drugs.
Dexedrine's basically speed in a pill,
you know.
l guess a lot of the doctors are balancing
out the Prozac with the Dexedrine, so. . . .
That liquid morphine
will knock you down, out. . .
. ..around, up and down,
someone's not careful.
You can't mix those up, you know.
[RlNGS]
Strong, strong stuff here, boy. Wow!
What you have wrong,
you need all this stuff?
-Motherfucker.
-What?
-Motherfucker. You fucking asshole.
-What are you talking about?
-Who the fuck do you think you are?
-l'm just trying--
l come in here. You don't know me.
You don't know who l am, what my life is. . .
. ..and you have the balls, the indecency
to ask me a question about my life?
-Please, lady, calm down.
-Fuck you too! Don't you call me "lady"!
l come in here,
l give these things to you.. .
. ..you check,
you make your phone calls. . .
. ..look suspicious, ask questions.
l'm sick.
l have sickness all around me,
and you fucking ask me my life?
"What's wrong?"
Have you seen death in your bed?
ln your house?
Where's your fucking decency?
And then l'm asked fucking questions.
"What's wrong?"
You suck my dick, that's what's wrong.
And you. You fucking call me "lady"?
Shame on you!
Shame on you. Shame on both of you.
CHAD [OVER PHONE]:
Why don't they have the same last name?
Because they don't
have the same last name.
PH lL: l know, and l can't really explain that,
but l think--
l have a feeling there is something,
you know, a situation between them. . .
. ..like they don't know each other
much or well, you know?
Something like they don't talk much
anymore, even.
Uh-huh.
You know? God, does this sound weird?
Ha, ha. l just don't understand
why you're calling me.
Well, there's no number for Frank
in any of Earl's stuff.. .
. ..you know, and he's pretty out of it.
l mean, like l said, he's dying.
Dying of cancer. So....
-What kind of cancer?
-lt's brain and lung.
-My mother had breast cancer.
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-ls she all right?
-Oh, she's fine now.
-Oh, that's good.
-lt was scary, though.
-Oh, it's a hell of a disease.
-Oh, it sure is.
-Yeah.
-Well, so, uh....
Wait, l'm sorry. So why call me?
l know this sounds silly,
and l know that l might sound ridiculous...
. ..like this is the scene of the movie...
. ..where the guy is trying to get ahold
of the long-lost son. . .
. ..you know, but this is that scene.
This is that scene.
And l think they have
those scenes in movies. . .
. ..because they're true, you know.
Because they really happen.
And you gotta believe me,
this is really happening.
l mean, l can give you my number
and you can go check. . .
. ..with whoever you gotta check with. . .
. ..but do not leave me hanging on this.
All right? Please. l'm just-- Please.
See. . . .
[CHUCKLES]
See, this is, uh, the scene of the movie
where you help me out.
You're great. These are great questions.
GWENOVlER: Thank you. Good, good.
-This is going great.
See, l thought you grew up
here in the Valley.
Yeah. You know, like l said. Around.
You went to Van Nuys High, right?
l wouldn't say l went. l frequented.
l was misguided, pathetic.
Not the Frank T.J. Mackey. . .
. ..you're so eagerly, uh, wanting
to put on national television.
Because l was swimming in what was
as opposed to what l wanted.
-Where does that name come from?
-What name? My name?
Yeah. lt's not your given name, right?
lt's my mother's name, actually.
That's good. Good. Done your research.
-And "Frank"?
-Frank is my mother's father.
Oh, okay. That's why.
See, l had some trouble. . .
. ..locating your school records
at, um, UCLA and, uh, Berkeley.
And it's your name change.
See, they had no official enrollment for you.
-No, no, no, they wouldn't.
-They wouldn't?
No, because l was never
officially enrolled there.
-Was that unclear?
-Kind of.
Oh. God, l wouldn't want that
to be misunderstood.
No, uh, my enrollment
was totally unofficial.
Sadly, l couldn't afford
to pay the tuition up there.
There were three wonderful professors
who let me to sit in their classes.
Their names were Macready, Horn,
and Langtree, among others.
You're welcome to call them if you like.
See, l didn't get a free ride. . .
. ..so, what we're looking at here
is a true rags-to-riches story.
That's why people respond so strongly
to Seduce. . .
. ..because at the end of the day,
Seduce may not be just...
. ..about picking up chicks,
sticking your cock in.
lt's about finding out
what you can be in this world...
. ..defining it, controlling it,
and saying, "l will take what is mine."
And you happen to get a little blow job
out of it...
-. . .then, hey, what the fuck? Why not?
-Ha, ha, okay. There you go.
End of Round One.
Excellent work, ladies and germs.
l think we should take a look
at the scores here.
Kids are up a leg with 1 500...
. ..and the adults are down a little bit
with 1 025.
So we'll be back for Round Two in a
ring-ding-do.
[MUSlC PLAYS]
Whoa, hello, hello.
Bonus musical question.
And the winner is...
. ..kids.
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDlNG]
Uh, kids are in the lead. They get a chance
to pull further ahead. . .
. ..if they can answer the following
secret-bonus musical question.
Now, what l'm going to do
is read a line from an opera.
Give me that line back. . .
. ..in the language
in which the opera was written. . .
. ..and for a bonus 250-- Um, 250--
Uh, 250...
. ..uh, you can sing it. Heh.
Here's the line.
"Love is a rebellious bird
that nobody can tame...
. ..and it's all in vain to call it
if it chooses to refuse."
[BUZZER RlNGS]
Yes, Stanley.
Well, that was in French. . .
. ..and that was from the opera Carmen...
. ..and that goes:
[SlNGlNG lN FRENCH]
-You got some coffee brewing here.
CLAUDlA: lt's not--
[CLAUDlA COUGHS]
lt's been on for a bit.
Yeah, l like iced coffee, generally. . .
. ..but a day like today, you know,
with the rain and whatnot...
. .. l enjoy a warm cup.
[CLAUDlA SlGHS]
Do you want a cup?
ls that all right?
Just raining cats and dogs out there.
l'd just as soon not go back in it. Heh.
l don't know how fresh it's gonna be.
Oh, l'm sure it's fine, Claudia.
Do you, um, take cream or sugar?
That would be fine. Um--
So, Claudia, let me just say,
so l can get my role as an LAPD officer. ..
. ..out of the way
before we enjoy our coffee.
l don't like to talk shop over coffee.
l'm not gonna write you up.
l'm not gonna give you
a citation here. . .
. ..but the real problem we have here
is that you got people around you...
. ..people who work from home
trying to get some work done...
. ..and if you're listening to your music
that loud, they're inconvenienced by that.
lf you had a job,
you'd probably understand, but....
You like listening to your music.
That's fine. That's fine. Um. . ..
You're just gonna wanna keep an eye
on the volume level.
You know, maybe memorize
what number you see on the dial.
lf it's the middle of the day,
that's what l do.
l set it at two and a half, and then l know
that's a good listening level for me.
But, uh, you like listening
to your music loud.
That's fine. That's cool.
lt's good to rock out sometimes.
But you can't do it every day. . .
. ..or else you risk
damaging your ears. Seriously.
-You listen to it all the time like that?
-Yeah.
You're gonna drive these people crazy.
Anyway, you get the point.
-Yes.
-Okay.
Um....
Cheers.
-So this boyfriend bothering you?
-l don't have a boyfriend.
-The gentleman who was at the door--
-He's not my boyfriend.
Okay. A lot of times,
in domestic-abuse situations. . .
. ..the young woman
is afraid to speak out.
You don't have to be afraid
to tell me anything.
And as a police officer, l can tell you. ..
. ..it goes bad places.
Young woman is afraid,
next thing you know, l'm here on a 1 87.
lt's not-- What's a 1 87?
lt's not good. And it's where situations
like this always lead.
lt's not my boyfriend,
and it's not anything.
lt's over. Really. lt's not.
He won't come back.
-l don't wanna have to come back here--
-You won't have to.
You know, l--
l wouldn't mind coming back.
You know, get a look
at your pretty face again.
l'll be right back.
Here you go.
Let's get the jacket off.
lt will help you to breathe.
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDlNG]
l can't fucking do this.
l've, uh--
l think-- l'm gonna throw up, l think.
l haven't thrown up
since l was 20 years old.
STANLEY:
Cynthia.
BURT:
You are the man.
[DlCK AND BURT SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
-What's the problem?
-l need to go to the bathroom.
Jesus Christ, Stanley. You can't go now.
You have one minute
before we're on the air.
Now is not the time
to go to the bathroom.
RlCHARD: Why does this always happen?
-Hey.
Excuse me, is there a problem over there?
Mind your own business.
-You better watch your mouth.
-Why don't you mind your own business?
LUlS: Oh, no, she didn't.
-Cool down. Cool it, please.
Now, Stanley, wait for the
commercial break, then you can go.
-Just hold it.
LUlS: Where did they get these kids?
Don't taunt the kids.
-l'm trying to be helpful.
CYNTH lA: Don't start trouble, Luis.
Honey, you haven't seen trouble.
Wait till next commercial break.
-What's the problem?
-Nothing.
Lily! Please!
FRANK [ON RECORDlNG]:
Order Seduce and Destroy....
-Get away from me, you shithead!
-Okay.
[DOGS BARKlNG]
Can't afford it?
We'll work out something for you.
Seduce and Destroy will change your life.
Watch out, watch out, watch out.
No.
Don't, don't, don't.
-l'm gonna save you.
-Hi? Hello? Okay.
I guarantee, money-back guarantee--
-Don't eat these.
-This will change your life.
It's gonna help you get
that naughty sauce that you....
-For a low cost of 49.99....
PH lL: Here you go.
[EARL GROANlNG]
Come on out of the cold
and order Seduce and Destroy...
...for the low cost of 49.99.
We take all credit cards.
-I take Visa, MasterCard....
PH lL: Out of the trash, out of the trash.
CHAD:
Hey, Phil, are you there?
-lt's Chad.
-Yeah. Hi, Chad.
Yeah, listen, I'm gonna put you in touch
with Janet, Frank's assistant.
-Okay.
-And she's gonna see what she can do.
Thank you very much,
and good luck to you and your mother.
Thanks, man. You too.
Okay, Janet, are you there?
JANET: Hello?
CHAD: All right, Janet, you have Phil Parma.
Okay?
l have cancer, Mary.
l have about two months.
l have no time.
lt's in my bones.
l don't have a chance.
-Oh.
-l'm fucked.
DlRECTOR: And 1 5 seconds.
LUlS: You got any cookies or anything?
[TEAMS WHlSPERlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
DlRECTOR:
Ten seconds.
And five, four, three, two. . ..
We're back, ready for Round Two.
We're talking
to our adult contestants here today.
Uh, Mim, it says here
that you live in California...
...and that you have two kids.
MlM:
Right. I have a six-year-old son....
Do you know who l am?
You're a friend of the family, l presume.
What does that mean?
Nothing special.
Just a spoke in the wheel.
You talk in rhymes
and riddles and rub-a-dub...
. ..but that doesn't mean anything to me.
See, see-- See, l used to be smart.
l'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith.
l'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith
from TV.
lt might have been before my time.
MAN:
l remember now. ln the sixties, right?
-l'm "Quiz Kid" Donnie Smith.
-Like you said.
Smart kid. You got struck by lightning
at one time, right?
DONNlE:
So what?
-l heard about that.
-Did it hurt?
DONNlE:
Yes.
But you're all right now.
So, what's the what?
-What?
-That's right.
l used to be smart. Now l'm just stupid.
Ha! Brad, dear, who was it that said:
"A man of genius has seldom been ruined
but by himself"?
Um....
THURSTON: The lovely Samuel Johnson.
-Ah.
Who also spoke of a fellow
who was not only dull...
. ..but a cause of dullness in others.
DONNlE:
The cause of dullness in others.
-Picky, picky.
-Let me tell you this.
Samuel Johnson
never had his life shit on...
. ..and taken from him,
and his money stolen.
Who took his life and his money?
His parents? His mommy and daddy?
Make him live this life like this.
A man of genius
who gets shit on as a child...
. ..and that scars. That hurts.
Have you ever been hit by lightning?
lt hurts. lt doesn't happen to everyone.
lt's an electrical charge.
lt finds its way across the universe.. .
. ..and it lands in your body
and your head.
And as for "ruined but by himself"...
. ..not if his parents
took his freaking life. ..
. ..and his money,
and tell you to do this. . .
. ..and to do that,
and if you don't, well... .
MAN: Your parents took your money
that you won on that game show?
Yes. They did.
What does that mean,
"a spoke in the wheel"?
THURSTON:
Things go round and round, don't they?
Yes, they do. They do.
But l'll make my dreams come true.
Sounds sad as a weeping willow.
l used to be smart.
But now l'm just stupid.
Shall we drink to that?
Um, l wanna talk a little bit more
about your background.
You made, um, some references earlier. ..
. ..to, uh, subjective human experiences
and terrible things, and, um. . . .
Actually, l'm confused about your past,
is the thing.
-ls that still lingering? lt's so boring.
-Just to clarify.. . .
-Just wanna clear some things up.
-Useless. Mm.
Excuse me. See-- Thank you, Muff.
lt's a funny thing that--
This is an important element
of Seduce and Destroy.
Facing the past is an important way
of not making progress.
This is something l tell my men
over and over and over.
GWENOVlER:
This isn't meant, um. . . .
See, l try to teach my students to ask:
"What is it in aid of?"
-Are you asking me that?
-Yes.
-Well, in trying to figure out who you are. . . .
-ln aid of what?
Well, Frank, l'm saying
that in trying to figure out who you are--
l have more important things...
-. . .to put myself into.
-Well, no, it's all important.
l think this is something important. ..
. ..that you might need to think about
putting yourself into.
-Mm. Not really.
-Um, look, Frank...
. ..it's not like
l'm trying to attack you here.
-No.
-l just--
Okay. Hey, this is how you wanna spend
your time, then go, go, go.
But you're gonna be surprised
at what a waste it is.
"The most useless thing in the world
is that which is behind me." Chapter Three.
We talked earlier about your mother.. .
. ..and we talked about your father
and his death.
l don't want to be challenging,
but l have to ask, um....
l just wanna clarify something.
Something that l understand....
-l'm not sure l hear a question in here.
-l'm trying to put this as delicately as l can.
What's the question?
-Do you remember a Miss Simms?
-l know a lot of women.
-l'm sure she remembers me, ha, ha.
-She does. From when you were a boy.
-Yeah?
-She lived in Tarzana.
That's my old stomping ground.
ls this the attack portion
of the interview?
[GWENOVlER LAUGHS]
-ls the girl coming in for the kill?
-No. This is about getting something right. . .
. ..and clarifying answers
to an earlier question.
What question?
l was told that your mother died, Frank.
That's what you heard.
[CHUCKLES]
Do you remember Miss Simms?
-No.
-Well, l talked to Miss Simms. . .
. ..your neighbor and caretaker
after your mother died in 1 980. . .
. ..and in my research...
. .. l have you listed as the only son
of Earl and Lily Partridge.
And what l learned from Barbara Simms
is that your mother, Lily...
. ..died in 1 980.
So, see, it's my understanding
that information supplied. . .
. ..by you and your company...
. ..and the answers

your actual family history....
Well, this is important.
What is your fucking question?
Well, l guess my question is this:
Why would you lie, Frank?
[CLEARS THROAT]
Kids, adults...
. .. l would like you
to put yourself at a picnic.
Uh, place yourself there
with your family and friends, if you'd like.
You'll hear three musical notes,

that you would find at a picnic.
The first three notes. Guys?
[MUSlC NOTES PLAY]
[BUZZER RlNGS]
JlMMY: Yes, Todd.

-Are you on drugs right now?
lf l tell you something, if l say things, then--
You're a lawyer, right?
You can't say anything, tell anybody.
lt's like a privilege. Attorney/client.
-You understand?
-Not exactly.
Like a shrink.
lf l go see a shrink, l'm protected.
l can say things. Oh, fuck.
-l don't know what l'm doing.
-Linda, you're safe, okay? lt's all right.
You're my friend.
You and Earl are clients.
Whatever you wanna say

You have something
you wanna say to me. . . .
l have to tell you something.
l have something to tell you.
l wanna change his will.
Can l change his will? l need to.
No, you can't change his will.
Only Earl can.
No, no, no. You see, um. . .
. .. l never loved him.
l never loved him. Earl.
When l met him-- When l started--
l met him, l fucked him, and l married him. ..
. ..because l wanted his money.
You understand?
Uh, l'm telling you this.
l've never told anyone.
Uh, l didn't love him...
. ..but now-- l know l'm in that will.
We were all there.
We made that thing. And the money l'll get.

as he's dying, and....
Uh, l look at him, and he's about to go,
Alan. He's moments....

What now, then?
JlMMY:
Let's listen.
[lN SOUTHERN ACCENT] "Hello, Mary.
How are you and the seven kids?
As you probably heard by now, we sure
gave that Pope a run for his money."
[BUZZER RlNGS]
JlMMY: Mim.
MlM: Um, that would be Robert E. Lee.
His wife was Mary Parke Custis.
l know he had seven children.
Um, and he would be talking about Pope,
who he defeated at the Battle of Manassas.
JlMMY:
Absolutely right, Miss Mim. Next question.
Come on, come on, come on.
Snap out of it, man.
Come on. Stanley.
[SlGHS]

l don't want him to die.
l didn't love him when we met.. .
. ..and l did so many bad things to him
that he doesn't know.
Things that l want to confess to him.
But now l do. l love him.
-Linda, what kind of medication are you on?
-This isn't any fucking medication talking!
Can you give me nothing?
You have power of attorney.
Can you go in the final fucking moments
and change the will?
l-- l don't want any money.
l couldn't live with myself
with this thing that l've done.
l fucked around. l fucking cheated on him.
l fucking cheated on him.
There. There.
You're his lawyer, our lawyer.
l am his wife. We are married.
l broke the contract of marriage.
l fucked around on him many times.
l sucked other men's cocks.
ALAN:
Adultery is not against the law.
lt's not something you can use in court
to discredit the will.
-Linda. Linda, calm down.
-l can't.
You don't have to change the will.
lf you wanna take nothing,
renounce the will when the time comes.
What does that mean?
Where does the money go?
-lt goes to the nearest relative.
-What's that? Frank?
No, no, no. That can't happen.
Earl doesn't want him to have anything.
-That's what will happen.
-This is so fucked up.
Linda, stop!
Now, you take a moment, you breathe...
-. . .and one thing at a time.
-Shut the fuck up.
-You want me to help you?
-Shut the fuck up.
-You need to sober up.
-Now, you must really shut the fuck up.
Now. Please, shut the fuck up.
-Linda.

JlMMY: Now, imagine

lt's very recognizable.
lt's Chopin, actually, and, uh.. . .
Well, it's taken--
lt's in the style of "Marche Militaire."
lt's a very recognizable piece.
So if you please just listen to this. . .
. ..and l'm sure you can identify the, uh. ...
l'm sort of
giving away the answer here, but--
lt's Chopin. l don't mean

[LOCK CLlCKS]
GWENOVlER: Frank, l'm really
not trying to attack you here.
l think that if you have something
that needs to be cleared up, well, then....
l was told that your father
is Earl Partridge.
l was told that he left
you and your mother...
. ..and you were forced to take care
of your mother during her illness. . .
. ..that you took care of your mother
while she struggled with cancer. . .
. ..and that Miss Simms
became your caretaker. . .
. ..when your mother finally passed away.
Can you talk about your mother, Frank?
[CELL PHONE RlNGS]
No, not true. You know what?
Even if you don't get to pump her. . .
. ..you still need to start honing your skills
on a feminist.
[CELL PHONE RlNGlNG]
-You need to do that.
MAN: l will.
-This is Doc.
JANET: Doc, it's Janet.
-What's up, Janet?

-Get him on the phone with me right away.

Doc, go get Frank
and put him on the phone.
[GWENOVlER SlGHS]
GWENOVlER:
Oh, come on, Frank.
What are you doing?
What am l doing?
Yeah.

[AUDlENCE APPLAUDING]
And five, four, three, two. . ..
Yeah?
Oh, boy, what a day. What a round.
Back and in for me. . .
. ..and the final one-on-one round
to determine who's who today.
Let's check the scores
on the board, shall we?
Well, the kids have an even 2000...
. ..and the adults are way up with 47.
Now, that doesn't mean
that this game is out of reach for the kids.
-Elders, who's the lucky so-and-so?
-lt's gonna be me, Jimmy.
[AUDlENCE APPLAUDlNG]
Come on over, Mim.
l don't wanna go. l can't do it this time.
What the fuck are you talking about?
You have to go, Stanley.
You're the smartest.
l don't wanna go.
Why can't one of you do it?
RlCHARD: lf you don't fucking stand up
and get over there, l'm gonna beat your ass.
l'm sick of being the one
who always has to do everything.
-l don't wanna be the one always.
JlMMY: Kids, l don't even have to ask.
Stanley, get your butt over here.
l'm sick.
l'm sick here now.
l confuse melancholy
with depression sometimes.
-Mm-hm.
-You see?
Why don't you run along now, friend?
Your dessert is getting cold.
-l'm sick.
THURSTON: Stay that way.
l'm sick, and l'm in love.
THURSTON: You seem the sort of person
who confuses the two.
That's right.
That's the first time you've been right.
l confuse the two, and l don't care.
Hey. Hey!
l love you.
l love you, and l'm sick.

lf you wanna love me back,
l'll be good to you.
l'll be goddamn good for you.
l won't be mad
if you don't know who said what.
l won't punish you
if you get the answer wrong.
THURSTON: Brad, honey.
-l can teach and tell you... .
You have a special secret crush
over there, l think.
Don't treat him too lovely.
He might get hurt.
-You shut up! Mind your own business.
-Gently, son.
l know you don't love me now.
lt's a dangerous thing
to confuse children with angels.
Wanna know the common element
for the entire group, like he asked?
l'll tell you the answer,
because l had that one.
l had that question.
Uh, carbon. Carbon.
ln pencil lead,
it's in the form of graphite. ..
. ..in coal,
it's mixed up with other impurities. . .
. ..and in the diamond, it's in hard form.
"Well, all we really wanted to know
was the common element, Donnie...
. ..but thank you for all
that unnecessary knowledge. Ha, ha.
Kids. Heads so full of useless knowledge.
Thank you. Thank you."
The book says, "We may be
through with the past...
. ..but the past is not through with us."
And. . . .
No, it is not dangerous
to confuse children with angels.
[VOMlTS]
Yeah. Okay.
Well, that is what l wait for.
l wait for those calls.
And l wait and l pray.
And sometimes Jesus says:
"Jim, l got a surprise for you today.
l want you to meet this young lady, okay?
Now, where it goes from there
is up to you.
And l don't think
you're gonna screw it up, okay?"
And, God, l'm telling you right now...
. .. l will not screw it up.
You gave me an opportunity.
l'm gonna treat this young lady right.
l'm a happy cop.
Yeah. lt's called jaywalking. Slow down.
Uh, I'm gonna pass, Jimmy.

Phil, have you talked to anyone else

PH lL: No, I haven't.
JANET: Good, let's keep it that way, okay?
All the security and whatnot.
You understand?
This could be a delicate situation
for the family.

PH lL: Thank you.

l need a player here for one-on-one.
RlCHARD: We want Stanley to go, Jimmy,

FRANK:
You wanted my time. l gave it to you.
You called me a liar.
You made accusations.
You said:
[AS GWENOVlER] "Well, if l had known,
then l wouldn't have asked."
So it's not an attack.

who doesn't keep his word...

"l am so sorry, baby. l am so sorry."

[CHUCKLES]
So beautiful.
And l cheated on her...
. ..over and over and over again.. .
. ..because l wanted to be a man...

So stupid, that fucking mind. Stupid.

Did l think for what l'd done?
She was my wife for 23 years...
. ..and l went behind her over and over.
Fucking asshole that l am,
l'd go out and l'd fuck...
. ..and l'd come home
and get in her bed...
. ..and say, "l love you."
This is Jack's mother.
His mother, Lily.

l loved Lily.
l cheated on her.
She was my wife for 23 years.

And l have a son.
And she has cancer.
And l'm not there...
. ..and he's forced to take care of her.
He's 1 4 years old.

To take care of his mother and.. . .
And watch her die on him.
A little kid, and l'm not there.
And she does die.
EARL:
l loved her so.
And she knew what l did.
She knew all the fucking

But the love...
...was stronger

The goddamn regret.

[EARL SOBBING]
And l'll die.
Now l'll die, and l'll tell you what.
The biggest regret of my life....
I let my love go.
What did I do?
I'm 65 years old.
And l'm ashamed.

The fucking regret and guilt,
these things....
Don't ever let anyone ever say to you...
...you shouldn't regret anything.
Don't do that. Don't. Oh.
You regret what you fucking want. Ah.

NARRATOR: And there is the account
of the hanging of three men...
...and a scuba diver...
...and a suicide.
There are stories
of coincidence and chance...
...and intersections,
and strange things told...
...and which is which,
and who only knows?
And we generally say:
"Well, if that was in a movie,
l wouldn't believe it."
Someone's so-and-so
met someone else's so-and-so, and so on.
And it is in the humble opinion
of this narrator...
...that strange things happen all the time.
And so it goes, and so it goes.
And the book says:
"We may be through with the past...
...but the past ain't through with us."
