Sergeant Billings. Sir.
I found something.
That's a shell casing from a rifle.
Keep looking for Stansbury.
You heard me. Do it.
Let's go.
Wonder where they
put the batteries in this thing?
I also hear it makes a hell of a milkshake.
What's going on with you?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
You've been jumping out
of your skin all morning.
And these last few weeks,
I don't know where you are.
What's happening?
Talk to me.
Babe,
please.
There's been an...
an incident.
And it's...
It's bad.
It's real bad.
And I'm gonna have to...
I'm gonna have to make a choice.
Make a choice? What are you talking about?
Between me or her.
Sarah?
What did you do, Stephen?
I'm gonna mess up our kid.
I'm just a piece of shit like my dad.
No, you're not.
You're not.
You say that, but...
You don't know what you're
talking about because...
you don't know what I did.
Whatever happened...
doesn't matter.
Not now.
We're having a child.
There's nothing more to say.
Hey, guys. How are we doing today?
Good, great.
- How's your pH balance?
- Uh, it's a six.
- Ready to meet your baby?
- Absolutely, yeah.
We're excited. Right, babe?
Yeah.
This is the best part.
I mean, besides actually having your baby.
You're gonna get a real kick out of it.
Let's take a listen first.
What is that?
Your little girl's heartbeat.
It's a girl?
Congratulations, you two.
Come on, Holder, you dumb prick.
Detective?
Deputy Commissioner Brandt's
ready to see you now.
Okay.
Detective Linden.
Let me in. Let me in. Let me in.
- What happened?
- They tried to kill me.
They were chasing me and
then... and they shot at me.
- Who shot at you?
- They shot at me.
AJ and Lincoln. In the woods.
They told me to kill her.
They wanted me to kill her.
- Kill who?
- My mom. They're crazy.
They kept screaming, "Kill, kill, kill."
Okay, Kyle, I need you to breathe.
I need you to calm down and breathe.
They put that gun in my room.
They knew where all the
bodies were on the floor.
And then she had the gun.
Colonel Rayne had the gun.
They all did it together.
They did it together. Oh, God.
I don't wanna remember it. I don't wanna
remember it. I don't wanna remember it.
It's okay. You don't have to.
You don't have to. You're
okay. You're gonna be okay.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. I promise.
Nobody's gonna hurt you. You're okay.
- You're okay.
- I wanna go home.
I know. I know.
Shh.
I want that search
warrant issued right now.
Call me as soon as you get it from the
judge or I'm going to the DA myself.
Are you going?
I just have to go out for a little while.
You're safe here on the island.
Nobody knows you're here.
It's so green.
It's like it's not even real.
Like what Eden must have been like.
And that's the Tree of Life.
No one is going to find you here, Kyle.
Is that why you're here?
So no one will find you?
You should get some sleep.
Linden.
Yeah. I'm heading out now.
I can't find Knopf,
Fielding or Stansbury anywhere, ma'am.
I checked the barracks
again and all the classrooms.
- Keep looking.
- They probably left campus, ma'am.
I don't wanna see your
face again until you find them.
Am I making myself clear, cadet?
Where were you?
What were you doing?
Answer me!
He knows.
Everything. He remembers everything.
- That's not possible.
- We tested him.
We tried to see if he'd
remember and he did.
Lincoln was right all along.
It was just a matter of
time before he remembered.
We should've killed him as
soon as he came back here.
You need to watch your tone
with me, Cadet Fielding.
- Fuck that cadet bullshit.
- Don't talk to her like that.
Why are you defending her?
She doesn't care about us.
She never did.
She knew Kyle would remember
and didn't give a fuck.
I say we do her.
Right here.
Right now.
Let's blow the bitch away.
What did you do to Kyle?
Answer me!
You said if I trusted you
everything would be okay.
But it's not.
None of this is okay.
How dare you talk to me about trust?
You stole my vehicle to go to that house.
You took a weapon there.
And then, when it was all over,
you came to me to fix what you did.
You said we were a family.
But you're a liar. You just
lied. You only care about him.
I fixed it all for all of
you. What more do you want?
- You'd have gone to prison if I hadn't.
- Bullshit!
It was all bullshit!
You used me. You didn't care about
me. All you cared about was him.
Now you fucking tell me why.
No.
I will do no such thing.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Now you tell me
what you did
to Cadet Stansbury.
Nothing.
He got away.
You're glad?
He's going to the cops, and
he's gonna tell them everything.
We're going to prison!
Not if we stick to the plan.
Fuck you.
And fuck your plan.
AJ, let's get out of here.
Where are you going?
Don't you walk away from me!
- You're not permitted entry...
- Get out of our way.
Get out of the way.
- Shots fired.
- Move, move.
Upstairs.
- Where'd the shots come from?
- Get out of here!
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Police!
- Police! Drop your weapon!
- Drop your weapon!
- Get on the ground!
- Stand down!
- Check them.
- They're gone.
- Jesus Christ.
Stand down! Stand down! Back off!
Drop your weapon, Margaret.
Put the gun down, Margaret.
Put the gun down, Margaret.
Holder,
I got this.
I killed the Stansburys.
You have to arrest me.
Why shoot them if you're
so willing to confess?
Your alibi checked out, we
have the tapes from the hotel.
You were never in that house that night.
- Why are you lying?
- I'm not lying.
I'm confessing.
I'm a soldier.
I know how to accept the
consequences of my actions.
That's how things work in my world.
Who are you protecting?
You've been protecting
him from the beginning.
You cleaned up the car.
You did everything in your
power to keep us away from him.
Put the gun down, Margaret.
Philip didn't give
Kyle those soldiers, you did.
Seventeen little soldiers,
one for each of Kyle's birthdays.
Seventeen years ago, you lost a
child. It was your greatest loss.
The baby didn't die, did he?
It wasn't Philip that you
were following all those years.
It wasn't him you wanted to see
when you sat outside that house,
when you went on all those trips.
It was Kyle.
Because he's your son.
Don't tell him, please.
He'll think that I didn't want him.
He'll never understand.
I'm just not built that way.
To love a child
makes you open to all
the hurt in the world.
Philip just...
He never loved Kyle.
I know that now.
Why didn't I see it?
Why didn't I see it?
Just...
for years...
I watched him.
And there was always this sadness.
You should've seen it.
But he came back to you.
I thought he died, that night.
But he lived.
My son lived.
And I had a second chance
to know him and he's...
And he's been hurt.
So you have to arrest me.
I'm the one who left.
I'm the one to blame. Not him.
It's me. I'm his mother.
I know what it's like to walk away.
How hard it is to stay.
I know.
Put down your weapon.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.
Do understand these rights?
Hey, Linden.
Linden.
Let's go pick up Kyle.
She confessed.
So? She lied.
I'm arresting her for the
murder of Philip, Linda,
Phoebe and Nadine Stansbury.
No, you're not.
You're arresting her for those two
kids that are lying dead in her office.
That's it.
She didn't kill the Stansburys.
Don't you touch him.
You took that shell casing.
What?
It was never missing. You took it.
It was your insurance in
case they ever found out.
You'd have proof that I did it.
You and Reddick were talking. I saw you.
I sh... I should...
I should have known you'd leave me too.
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
Clear!
The back door doesn't lock.
That's how we got in that night.
You're not well. You don't
know what you're saying.
I remembered.
In your house...
I remembered everything.
You shouldn't be here.
Please. We should go.
But this is home.
The place you're supposed
to be safe, loved.
My dad hated me.
I saw it in his eyes every day of my life.
And my mother, I didn't exist to her.
Not to anyone.
Maybe it's me.
Maybe something's broken in me.
Maybe something's broken
in me and everyone knows it.
They hated me.
My family, my school,
everywhere I went, everyone hated me.
- You stop it, Kyle.
- They had no idea what real hate was.
You wanna be a soldier? You wanna be a man?
You have to learn to kill the things
you love, you weak piece of fucking shit.
- Now fucking do it. Kill, kill, kill.
- Fucking kill her!
- Kill. Kill. Kill.
- Kill. Kill. Kill.
Kill. Kill. Kill.
You wanna do it?
Let's do it.
Let's kill somebody.
I was gonna show
them what real hate was.
Sometimes we do wrong
things to make it right.
And the world doesn't understand,
because how could they?
There are times when you have
to make impossible choices.
You believe that?
I wanted to die.
I should have that night.
There weren't any bullets
left in Lincoln's gun,
so I went and got my dad's gun.
You wanted to die, but a part
of you wanted to live too.
Please.
Kyle, you don't have
much time, we have to go.
It hurts. It
hurts so much that I need...
What?
I don't know. I don't
know. I don't know what I...
Anything, just tell me, I'll help you.
Just tell me what you need.
To find a way out.
Help me.
Then tell me.
Tell me what you did.
And then it'll be okay.
Turn the light off,
man. She's gonna see us.
She's gonna fucking see us.
- Kyle?
- What the hell is going on?
What do you think you're
doing in here? Get out!
Oh, my God!
Oh, God! No!
Oh, fuck. Fuck.
Get the fuck out and go!
No! No!
No!
Oh! No! Stop! Don't!
No! No!
No, please!
I went from room to
room until they were silent.
And I was finally alone.
But I wasn't alone.
Did the monster go away?
Close your eyes, baby bird.
Close your eyes, please.
I promise it won't hurt.
I'm sorry, baby bird.
I'm sorry, baby bird.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Her eyes.
I couldn't stand to see it in her eyes.
See what?
That I was the monster.
That it was me.
I killed James Skinner.
I shot him twice.
I put him in the car and
drove it into the lake.
Holder had nothing to do with it.
Hm.
I offered him a deal.
With the baby coming, I
figured he'd be the weak link.
I knew you wouldn't be.
Not you, Sarah.
He told me to go fuck
myself in the rear end.
I'm waiving my rights.
I don't want an attorney.
Everything I've said
is admissible in court.
I'll sign anything you want.
You can arrest me now.
Deputy Commissioner.
Stay seated, Detective Linden.
Sarah, it's been a while.
How's your son?
Jack, right?
Uh, he's in high school
now, from what I recall.
What is this?
John tells me there's a rumor going around
about a Lieutenant Skinner.
According to this rumor
he was the so-called Pied
Piper serial murderer.
Yes. He killed those girls.
It isn't a rumor, it's true.
So I shot him.
I killed him.
I think you've made a mistake, Detective.
The coroner's official report.
Lieutenant Skinner's cause of death
was a self-inflicted
gunshot wound to the head.
It was ruled a suicide.
I'm sorry for your loss.
You had a personal relationship with
Lt. Skinner, from what I understand.
Add that to the stress of this last case,
and I can understand how his
suicide must have been quite a blow.
He didn't kill himself and you know it.
You...
put me in this chair.
I would gladly lock you up for
the rest of your fucking days.
But imagine the public response
if a cop, a high-ranking detective,
was the killer of young children.
The damage would be irreparable.
To whom?
- You?
- Joe Mills killed those girls.
Joe Mills didn't kill those girls.
Skinner confessed.
You have this on tape?
What evidence do you have, Detective?
I will go to the press.
You have a history...
of mental illness, Sarah.
It was nice seeing you.
Always the one with the conscience.
Sometimes that's not enough.
What are you doing here?
I thought you should have this.
It's your daughter's.
I shouldn't have said those things to you.
I'm sorry.
You had no right talking to me that way.
I know.
I know.
I'm gonna be a dad.
I'm gonna have a little girl.
I just don't wanna fuck it
up, you know, being a dad.
Then don't.
So where's your partner?
Sarah is her name, right?
- Still working together?
- I gotta go.
What's up, little bee?
I want strawberry and
lemonade cupcakes, Daddy.
But Parker can only have one
because it's my birthday, not hers.
That's right, little lady, it's
your birthday party, not hers.
Don't you worry, I got your back.
No vegan cupcakes, Daddy.
They taste like caca.
No. There's no vegan
caca in sight, I swear.
I pinky swear.
Pinky swear.
Kalia, my princess goddess up on
high, give your pops some loving.
You gotta shave, Mr. Flavor-Saver,
for my party because it feels yucky.
Go on and get some book learning.
And I'll pick you up from
your ma's on Saturday, okay?
God, grant me the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change...
- the courage...
- Amen.
To change the things I can...
and the wisdom to know the difference.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Absolutely.
- Okay.
Take 10, go smoke, do your toilette
or whatnot before group starts.
And bring your journals because
you got your assignment, right?
The Eleventh Step, a daily
connection with God as you define her.
All right, so quit
gawking and start writing.
Looking at you, José. You're up first.
Oh, snap.
One-900-Linden. Dial
and you shall receive.
Hi.
Hi, Holder.
What up, Linden?
I heard you got a new job.
I see you got a new scarf.
Yeah, Ross Dress for
Less, three-for-one rack.
Oh, snap, Linden got jokes?
You're looking good.
You too.
You look happy.
Happy, joyous and free, that's me.
I'm a daddy.
- Got a little girl.
- That's so great.
What's her name?
- Kalia.
- Oh, that's great.
She's the goddess of life and
death in the Hindustani traditions.
Oh, so you're Hindu now?
You know how we do.
When'd you come back?
I'm not back, I'm just passing through.
I've been on the road a
lot the last few years.
Um, I was in Chicago for a
while. Jack's in college now.
- He's almost as tall as you.
- What? Damn.
So did you find him on your travels
in the big wide world, Linden?
The bad guy.
There is no bad guy.
There's just... I don't know, life.
We tried at least. You gotta
give us credit for trying.
Yeah, we did.
Anyway, I just, um...
It's good to see you, Holder.
So why are you here?
For real?
Hm?
I never...
had a real house to grow up in.
You know, home.
I never belonged anywhere.
And all my life, I was
looking for that thing...
you know.
Thinking that it was out there somewhere.
That all I had to do was find it.
But I think, maybe...
that home was us.
It was you and me together
in that stupid car...
riding around, smoking cigarettes.
I think that was everything.
I'm sorry.
I should have known that you
were one person who always stays.
And you were my best friend.
Why don't you stay?
Stay.
Um...
I think that this city...
is a city of the dead for me, it's...
It's a matter of perception, ain't it?
Close your eyes.
- What?
- Just close your eyes.
No. You're so weird.
Just close your eyes.
Just give it a try.
Maybe you'll see what's really there...
standing right in front of you.
It ain't ghosts, Linden.
It ain't the dead.
- I'm gonna get a ticket, I should go.
- Linden.
Yeah?
Bye.
Bye.
