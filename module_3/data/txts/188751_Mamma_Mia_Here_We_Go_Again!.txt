It would be amazing
if someone could get these
to the mainland
for the last post.
The pleasure and privilege
will be mine.
Señor, you're the manager.
I need you to stay here
and make sure
this place is ready
for the most incredible
opening party of all time.
Whatever your dream,
Ms. Sophie, we will make real.
This was her dream.
I'm just trying
to see it through.
You've done much more than that.
Yeah, but is it enough?
I wish I could ask her.
I wish she was here.
It's collection time.
Let's not be late.
Wait.
She never shows up anyway.
Don't worry.
My mom was late for everything.
So, it is nearly time
for the graduating year
to go out into the world.
Supported by their friends
and families,
so many of whom they are
grateful to have in attendance
on this august day.
But first, custom dictates
that I call on
the undergraduate selected
- by his or her peers...
- Sorry, sorry.
To deliver
the valedictory address.
This year, that undergraduate,
punctual as ever...
is Donna Sheridan.
You're going to do
great things, Donna.
Thank you, Vice-Chancellor,
for everything.
This place has taught me so much
about friendship,
loyalty, love.
But most importantly,
it's taught me
that the best things in life,
the very best things,
happen unexpectedly.
Hit it!

She didn't come.
She didn't come.
My mother.
Can you believe she didn't come?
She never comes.
And every time, it surprises me.
I have gotta get better at that.
You give that woman hell
when you get home.
I am not going home.
- Not for a long time.
- Oh.
The old "stay away
as punishment" ploy.
I tried that, but my parents
just rented out my room.
And sold your dog.
No, it's not punishment.
It's the opposite.
It's like a gift to myself.
- Where will you go?
- Anywhere.
Everywhere.
Life is short,
the world is wide, and...
- I want to make some memories.
- Hmm.
In other words,
- you're leaving us.
- Oh.
I never would.
I was just putting out feelers
for our future.
Come on.
We'll always have each other.
Dynamos! Dynamite!
Sleep all day
and whoop all night!
Whoa!
Oh, they're so beautiful.
Uh, a little to the left.
Little bit more.
And down just a bit.
Perfect. Good.
Those flowers are beautiful.
Thank you so much.
Sky? What time is it there?
It's early.
I was just thinking about you.
About tomorrow.
- How's it going?
- Oh, you know,
nothing focuses the mind
like the last minute.
But you're ready.
I can't believe
I'm not gonna be there.
Feels weird.
Yeah, but we agreed...
six weeks in New York,
learning the hotel business
from the very best.
It was too big a chance
to pass up.
- Soph.
- What?
- Nothing.
- What?
No, it doesn't matter.
Except that it obviously does.
They've offered me
a job permanently.
Oh.
Okay.
- I can say no.
- But you don't want to.
You want to say
the opposite of no.
Yeah, I do.
But you could come with me.
But I'm here.
I'm always gonna be here.
Soph, your mum died a year ago.
And I rebuilt this hotel
in her honor.
She wouldn't want you
to dedicate your life to her.
She dedicated hers to me.
We can't keep having this fight.
Apparently we can,
until we realize
that there's nothing left
to fight for.
Sky?
Yeah, I know.
I should go.
Yeah.
I'll be thinking of you
tomorrow.
It's gonna be amazing.
Take care, Soph.
Yeah. You, too, Sky.

The poor girl
is under so much pressure.
The hotel reopening.
We have to be strong for her.
Strong. Absolutely.
- She needs our support.
- Mmm.
She needs bolstering.
Yeah. Well, bolstering's
what she'll get.
What she doesn't need
is you crying
every time someone
mentions Donna.
I'm so glad you're here.
Come on.
Let's get this show on the road.
She's very strong.
I can't wait to see
this hotel you've built.
Well, it wasn't actually me
who built it.
What's it called?
The Hotel Bella Donna.
Oh, God.
So, two of your three
possible fathers can't make it?
They're all my fathers,
and they have great reasons.
Harry is doing
some huge deal in Tokyo,
and Bill is receiving an award
for being the greatest Swede
of all time.
Maybe it's for the best.
Oh. Oh, I would have been fine.
Absolutely fine.
I'm-I'm very strong.
Just tell me you didn't
invite your grandmother.
Wicked Witch of the West.
She hasn't been seen outside
of Las Vegas for decades.
You must meet our hotel manager.
<i>Buenos días.</i>
Be still, my beating vagina.
Señor Cienfuegos,
these are my mother's
greatest friends.
- This is Tanya.
- <i>Doña Tanya.</i>
Hmm. Your beauty comes not only
from the exquisite structure
of your bones
and the laughter
in your sparkling eyes,
but from the goodness
that flowers within you.
Like a fountain.
Have him washed
and brought to my tent.
Don't think fountains flower,
do they?
Mine does.
And this is Rosie.
Madam Rosie.
Oh.
You have the courage of a lion
and the passion of a panther
and the wisdom of a flamingo.
- Are flamingos wise?
- Let the man speak.
We are going to the jetty
to make the welcome decorations.
Sounds wonderful.
We do our best.
It is all we have.
Señor Cienfuegos.
That means "a hundred fires."
So that's 50 for you
and 50 for me.
- 90-ten.
- 60-40.
80-20. That's my final offer.
<i>Uh, excusez-moi.</i>
<i>Oh, bonjour, mademoiselle.</i>
<i>Um... uh, je suis</i>
locked out <i>de ma chambre.</i>
- Oh, I don't...
- <i>Uh, je, um...</i>
put my tray out,
<i>uh, dans le corridor,</i>
<i>mais, uh, malheureusement</i>
<i>quand je, um...</i>
turned back, uh,
<i>la porte était fermée.</i>
<i>Et maintenant, j-je</i> need
<i>une, uh, uh...</i>
uh, spare key, uh, uh, <i>pour,</i>
<i>uh, reentrer dans la chambre.</i>
<i>S'il vous plaît, mademoiselle.</i>
Sorry, I didn't understand.
Could you say all that again?
<i>Oui.</i>
<i>Je suis...</i>
Wait a second.
I don't work here.
Well, I should call the police.
I'd rather you didn't.
They probably wouldn't
understand my French anyway.
So, Harry, you work in a bank.
I'm afraid so.
Uh, my father,
more or less, owns it.
I'm fulfilling my destiny.
I'm searching for mine.
I have this feeling
it's in Greece.
Why Greece?
I'll find out when I get there.
Leaving tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.
Right. Better move fast.
Um...
Would you mind carrying your
bag on your other shoulder?
Uh, sure. Why?
Well, 'cause then, you see,
the hand nearest me
would fall straight down,
and mine could sort of
brush against it.
And then I could take
your hand in mine
in a totally natural
and spontaneous way.
Or you could just ask
to hold my hand.
Of course, that's plan B.
It's not just Greece generally.
It's a specific place.
At the far end,
there's an island, Kalokairi.
And people used to think,
if you sailed on from there,
you'd fall off the edge
of the world.
That sounds like
the place for me.
Of-of course it does.
Absolutely.
Um, but now perhaps we can
change the subject slightly
and talk about the advantages
and disadvantages of us
spending the night together.
Whoa, okay.
Bold move.
Because, from where I'm sitting,
I mean, it seems to be
pretty much all upside
with-with very little reason
not to just crack straight on.
Mmm...
My family don't really
react well to foreign romances.
Years ago, my mom
was in Central America,
and she had her heart broken
into a million little pieces.
Right.
Yeah, fair enough.
I mean, I'm sure you're correct.
Mmm.
I mean, there is
one more reason, though.
You'd be doing me
a huge favor because...
yeah, this...
this would be my first time.
You're kidding.
No, it's a... a thing
I always say
to make me look cool.
No, I-I'm not kidding.
Uh...
Harry.
We just met today.
Yes, but when you know,
you know.
When you fall, you fall.
And when you're defeated
by love,
you're utterly defeated.

It was lovely.
Thank you.
No. Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.
How's it going down there?
There's enough moussaka
for millions,
with moussaka to spare.
I hope you'll be proud.
I already am.
And so are Bill and Harry.
I miss them.
They're really sorry
they couldn't make it.
If it had been any other date...
I know.
But I have you.
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I can face it.
I don't know if I can,
either, but... we still will.
Because it's a special night...
not for mourning,
but for celebration.
That's how Mom
would have wanted it.
She would have wanted
to be there.
To get very drunk indeed
and dance until she dropped.
Our dancing queen.
Yeah.
It will get better.
Yeah.
Just not quite yet.

Hey.
You grew your hair.
It's longer now.
It is a bit. Yeah.
I know we could talk about that,
but, uh, the ferry
leaves any second, and, uh...
I think great things
are waiting for me.
I prefer it shorter.
Wait! Wait!
Please!
Don't. Oh, God.
Turn around right now!
It's not too late!
This is great.
I'm just going to follow you
everywhere.
By the end of the day,
I'll have a whole new wardrobe.
I don't think that'll suit you.
I say I can make it work.
I really wanted
to catch that ferry.
There'll be another tomorrow.
Thanks.
Right, uh...
but what would be
really great...
today, not tomorrow...
is if, uh,
somewhere in this harbor
there was a guy.
Young, tall, dashingly handsome?
He's probably
passable-looking, but...
he has a boat.
And a couple of days free
before he takes part
in a sailing race.
So maybe he can take her
where she wants to go.
He'd love to.
But the sad fact is...
this-this isn't my boat;
I just wanted to impress you.
Oh, okay.
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
Jump on. I'm Bill.
I actually have an elderly
relative on the island
who help...
helped me buy this boat.
There are two beds,
but unfortunately,
- one of them is rather full.
- Huh.
Convenient.
You have one of those smiles
that makes
the rest of the world
smile, too.
It's lucky this trip
is not long enough
for my fragile heart
to shatter completely
when you leave my boat.
Ugh. I get it.
You're one of them.
One of who?
There are two kinds of seducer.
First doesn't actually
like women,
so wants to assert
his power over them,
but the second,
and far more dangerous,
is the guy who genuinely
falls in love every evening,
only to fall out of it again
the next morning.
But as you run away,
you tell her
you're the one in pain
and she's just too much
for you to handle.

Well, yes,
I had to cut it for work.
I wonder, could you please
hurry up a bit?
Uh, you see, I've followed
a girl all the way from Paris.
She wrote me a note.
A very kind note.
Saying good-bye.
But when you've found

Oh, that is bad luck.
I-I'll radio for someone
to come and help you.
They should be along soon.
- Bill.
- Please, please.
There is a woman waiting for me
on the mainland.
Her family,
they not want her to marry
a simple fisherman like Alexio.
They want rich man.
Ugly, fat, big mole on face,
but rich.
But she...
she want me.
And I love her
with all my heartness.
Please help, kind sir
and beautiful lady
with head full of curls.
Well, obviously
we're doing this.
Yes.
There!
I see them. Okay, everyone.
- We're nearly...
- Apollonia!
Whoa!
What are you doing?
We could get you closer.
If you love someone,
you're willing to die for her!
Yeah, but you don't have to.
It's an important distinction.
Apollonia!
Alexio!
Aah! Apollon...!
He's just swallowed
a big mouthful of water,
but the basic point
he's trying to make
is that he loves you.
What?
He loves you!
Apollonia!
Apollonia! No, Apollonia!
- Apollonia!
- Apollonia!
Apollonia, come back!
Yes!
Apollonia!
Apollonia!
- Good work.
- You, too.
Apollonia!
I love you!
Oh, God. I don't think
she can swim, either.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. - Morning.
Oh, good morning.
It's so nice. Guys.
- I'm glad you like it.
- I do.
And these are perfect.
- Everything is.
- Thank you.
It's so good.
It's all so amazing.
If you are happy.
I would be even happier
if you were happy.
No happiness for me. As you say,
that ship sailed
many long years ago.
But ships turn around.
They come back.
Not for me.
She left. Never to return.
But don't you worry.
I have made my peace with pain.
You and me both, señor.
What? What is it?
I'm not sure.
Tell me.
I fear a storm is coming.
You sure you're okay here?
Yeah, I'll be fine.
I'll come right back
after the race.
But that won't be
for three weeks.
Look at this place.
Isn't it beautiful?
It is, yeah.
What? What's wrong?
Storm is coming.
It's a clear sky.
Trust me.
Actually, don't.
- But I know I'm right.
- I'll still be fine.
I got a very good feeling.
And you and Sam did all of this?
- We had some help.
- From Sky.
Right. Yes, right.
And there is more.
Hello?
Hello?

So, uh, we've walked
the entire island.
I still haven't seen
where you live.
In a shack on a hill.
And what the hell
are you doing there?
Uh, I don't know.
Running away, I guess.
Back home, everything
was lined up for me.
A great job and just...
you know,
my whole life mapped out.
I wanted to take a break
before I signed up to it.
How about you?
I have absolutely nothing
mapped out.
And no clue
what the future holds.
Enough walking. Let's ride.
So, how come you're here
all alone, saving horses?
Uh, I've been traveling
all my life.
My dad was never in the picture,
and my mom's always on tour.
Oh, she sings?
Sweet as sugarcane.
You know,
there's some great stuff here.
This dress would look
very pretty on...
You really don't know me
at all, do you?

Okay. Great.
Right.
I just don't think you know
- what you're doing.
- Uh...
I'm hoping, if I keep pulling
on these two bits of wood,
we might eventually bump
into land.
Oh, okay.
There's another little island
over there.
I thought we might go
for a picnic.
Where's the food?
Oh, you're going to catch it
- on the way.
- Oh.
Uh...
So...
we haven't talked
about last night.
- No.
- You should know
that I never do that that fast.
I mean, hardly ever.
Well, sometimes.
A bit recently, in fact.
But on the whole, not.
I thought it was miraculous.
Um, I'm gonna say
something here,
and you should shut up
as I'm saying it
because you'll think
I'm crazy for a while.
But gradually, you'll...
you'll realize I'm right,
and then you'll spend
the rest of your life
thanking me
for saving so much time
and just getting straight to it.
Well, I'm ready.
I wasn't joking yesterday.
I was serious.
I want to stay here.
And I think you should, too.
I think we should make a choice
to do something radical
and wonderful.
To live in this
extraordinary place
with someone...
with someone miraculous.
I told you
you'd think it was crazy.
I just don't think
it's that simple.
Nothing is.
Everything is.
When you break it down.
I don't think it's crazy.
That'll do.
For now.
It's done.
It's done. We're done.
It's over.
Sophie, Sophie, my darling,
everything will be okay.
Apart from the fact that the
welcome decorations are down,
the garden is a swimming pool,
the swimming pool is a marsh.
We can take care of all of that.
The party's still a day away.
What party? I just got a call
saying that, because
of the storm last night,
no flights have come
into Athens at all.
So there will be
no millionaire guests
at the not-that-grand opening.
Which is just as well,
because the band
can't get here, either,
because the ferries
aren't running.
So there will be no one
to entertain
all the people
that aren't here anyway.
It really is over,
and I've let everybody down.
No, no, no, that's not true.
Especially Mom.
Nothing you do
could ever let her down.
Trust me, I know.
How-how do you know?
Because I did let her down.

I went after her.
Of course I did.
Chased her all the way back
to the farmhouse.
<i>Wait, Donna!</i>
Donna! Donna, please.
Please just listen to me.
- Love to.
- You will?
Yeah, of course.
I'll listen while you answer
three questions.
Are you engaged
to that beautiful woman?
Yes.
And did you tell me about it?
No.
And do you seriously think
- I could ever forgive you?
- Please, Donna.
- Go.
- Donna, please just listen to me.
That is enough listening! Go!

And now we turn, please,
to clause 47, item 12.
The wording here is unclear,
especially in reference to
"amortization
of accrued assets."
As the assets we discussed
are tangible, I advise
the more legitimate phrase,
"depreciation,"
be used henceforth.
And furthermore...
You are bored, Mr. Bright.
On the contrary.
Nothing I like more
than a good...
contract negotiation.
Especially one
that's been going on
for more than 14 hours.
This deal will make your company
the number one in Europe.
Worth taking time, I think.
Absolutely. 14 more hours.
Bring them on.
That's a nice picture.
Oh, my wife and daughter.
You have family?
I have a daughter.
Best thing in my life.
So, to continue.
Uh, clause 47, item 12.
As we said, the wording
is most unclear...
She really is
the best thing in my life.
This you already said.
Yes, I'm sorry.
I just realized something.
What, Mr. Bright?
What did you realize?
It's no use climbing the ladder
if you're on completely
the wrong wall.
The contract is marvelous,
by the way.
Make any changes you like.
Just sign. Sign, sign, sign.
His skill in writing
is matched only by his charm,
his sailing expertise
only by his charisma.
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in welcoming
the wonderful Bill Anderson.
Oh.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you for the award.
Um, I'd like to thank...
my mother, Alma.
Thank you. <i>Tack,</i> Mama.
And, uh...
I also have a wife.
- She's lovely.
- Hello?
- How's he doing?
- His best.
It's one thing
to get your twin brother
to take your science exams
at school,
but this is a different deal.
It was his idea.
He knows something I forgot:
That family is all that matters.
Just don't let him tell
the goat story.
There's a very amusing story
that I think you will find
really, really, really amusing.
It's about a goat.
So many bags.
I should have known.
It's not that many.
- Donna?
- Donna?
Donna!
Donna!
Oh, my God, I see what you mean.
This place is paradise!
I'm so glad you're here.
What's happened?
Where's the hot architect?
Oh, turns out
he was lying to me.
He's not an architect?
He's engaged.
To someone else.
And she looks beautiful, and...
now he's gone back to her.
I hate it when they do that.
- Okay.
- Aw.
So I've been sleeping
in this farmhouse.
I don't know who owns it,
but it's the most beautiful
place in the world.
It also has a horse.
Yes, very romantic.
We're taking you home.
Uh, not before
a fabulous performance
by the greatest girl band
in the world.
- Yes! Whoo!
- We've got all of the gear.
- Where are we playing?
- Oh, no, no, no.
I can't. I can't.
I'm not in that mood.
Oh, but it will put you
in that mood.
Of course it will.
The floodlights,
the greasepaint.
The adrenaline of the crowd.
A thousand descendants
of great Greek warriors
cheering and clapping furiously
as the irresistible beat
transforms their bodies into
pulsating pillars of flesh!
I don't know how
to sing about love
when I'm not feeling it.
Then sing about
what you are feeling.

- Hi, there.
- Bill?
Bravo!
I swear, it's true.
- My point is...
- I know what your point is.
You don't know what my point is.
Your point is that
you fancy him.
Mm, you see?
You were wrong.
That's not my point.
It's not that I fancy him.
My point is actually
that I love him
and I want to have his babies
and eventually push him around
in a wheelchair
and scatter his ashes.
I see.
And he likes Donna.
And I don't think
that's very fair.
He can help her feel better.
Do you know
what makes me feel better
when my heart's broken?
Cake.
Why doesn't she
just do that instead?
Just eat humongous amounts
of cake
and leave hot Scandi guy to me?
I'm going in.
No, you-you're staying out,
sister,
because you love Donna
and you want her happy.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
This is my friend, Bill.
- Hi.
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- I've heard nothing about you.
- Hi.
I brought Donna here on my boat.
You've got a boat?
He's got a boat?
And then I worried about her,
so I came back.
He worries, he cares,
and he's got a boat.
And now I'm taking her out
to sea again.
Taking her out to sea again...
in a boat.
You don't think I should go?
Are you kidding?
Of course you should.
Tell her she should go.
- You should absolutely go.
- That's what I'm saying.
I-I'm saying it, too. Go. Go.
Go.
- And do everything I would do.
- Nearly everything. Sorry.
Thanks, guys.
- I'll be back soon.
- Bye, darling.
Bye.
Could I get some cake, please?
- Cake over here?
- A lot of cake.
He's not picking up.
I can't even tell him
how wrong it's all gone.
Do you think he's just not
hearing the phone?
Or that he's taking it
out of his pocket,
seeing it's you
and deciding not to answer?
It's wonderful that you put
that image in her head.
Bolster. Bolster.
I think his phone's on silent.
I don't even know what
I would say to him anyway.
You would say you love him more
than you love this argument.
- That's really good.
- I know.
I love him more
than any argument.
Ooh.
Just wish he was here
so I could tell him.
Well, I wish Bill was here,
too, so I could hit him.
What did go wrong with you two?
Oh...
Well, there was this
other woman hanging around.
I asked him about her, and...
you know you're in trouble
when the word "just"
comes before the word "friends."
That's how most
of my marriages ended, too.

Not a single ferry?
You can't be serious.
I made it all the way
from Stockholm
spending I don't know how much
on a private plane.
You can't tell me now I can't
make it the last few miles.
What?
Time has been most cruel
to you, sir.
Your hairline... it disappear.
And your face... it collapse.
I would suggest we swim for it,
but perhaps not.
Men at our time of life?
Sir, in your case,
age becomes you.
As it does the tree, the wine...
and the cheese.
Thank you very much.
You're not so bad yourself.
I was told you couldn't come.
Why the hell are you here?
I'm a spontaneous person.
No, you're not.
No, I'm not.
Oh, that was incredible.
Do you want to see
what's in there?
Oh, it doesn't matter.
Just getting it
is reward enough.
Really?
No. Are you kidding?
Open it now.
Drumroll.
Got it?
For you.
You're very kind.
I have at least 18
ulterior motives.
There is a lovely little
food store back there.
They've got this cake
called baklava,
which is layers of pastry
filled with chopped...
You've had enough.
Somewhere on a boat on the ocean
with someone that isn't me
is literally the handsomest man
in the world.
Right, except for this guy.
Jesus Christ.
What kind of island is this?
Take this. Yes, take this.
Hi.
I just want to be up-front
and say that I
visually enjoy you.
- Oh, that's, uh...
- You.
Man, coming over here.
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.
I'll be waiting.
Hi. I'm looking for...
I know who you looking for,
with your wandering eye
and restless groin.
I should cut it off,
the way you hurt
- that precious angel.
- I know, I know.
But she pick herself up
after you tearing
her heartstrings.
She leave on a boat
with most famous stud in Europe.
And I would not wait for return.
Man has so many notch
on his bedpost,
the bed fall down.
It's called karma,
and it's pronounced, "Ha!"
Yeah. I deserve that.
Okay, he's coming back.
Tell me I look good.
You always look good.
You're meant to be
bolstering me.
- I'm sorry.
- So bolster. Bolster.
All right.
You look so beautiful...
Whatever. My point is,
I don't even mind
if you're not rich.
I say...
- Where was that cake, now?
- Just back there.
- Let's go.
- Mm-hmm.
I just wanted to say
it was very nice
when you turned up today.
I'm glad I could help.
Thank you.
- Good night, then.
- Good night.
I was just really sad.
I know.
- Men are pigs.
- All of us.
Which is not to say
I don't like pigs.
I do like 'em.
I mean, I wouldn't want one
as a pet.
Just get over here.
I don't understand
how this gets us to the island.
It's a little trick I learned.
When you're faced
with a problem,
you literally
strap yourself down,
can't get up until it's solved.
Oh.
Well, let's put it to the test.
Too tight?
By no means.
Hey, you remember me?
I'm a man in my 50s.
Most days,
I don't remember my own name.
Perhaps this remind you.
Apollonia!
Alexio!
Listen, everyone.
Many moon ago, this great man
save my life by saving my love.
Ah, it was nothing.
Anybody would have done
the same.
Yeah.
Tough crowd.
These are difficult days
for them.
For all us fishermen.
For many years now,
we do more and more work
for less and less pay.
Now our boats lie idle,
and we drink
in joyless surrender
to our economic fate.
Well, in that case,
maybe all of you
want to come
to a very expensive party.
Totally free.
- A party?
- Yeah.
Yes! And bring your wives
and family!
Ah, come on.
Uh, just a minute.
I just seem to have, um,
tied this a little tighter.
Excuse me!
Hello? I just...
Anyone? Hello?
Need some help?
No guests.
Just us and a mountain of food.
I'm beginning to think
my soul mate
may actually be carbs.
Then mine must be wine.
And Sky is mine.
Maybe he's right.
Maybe I should leave
this island.
Sophie, listen.
Your mother...
was the bravest person
we ever met.
And if she taught you anything,
it's that it's your choice how
to live the rest of your life.
Do what makes your soul shine.
I'll try.
- Nailed it.
- To the wall, baby.
Yay.
Mmm.
It's going to be
a beautiful night.
Mm-hmm.
I wish I had someone
to share it with.
Oh, come on.
- We have each other.
- Yeah.
Oh, I think we've got
more than that.
Take a look.
It's Bill and Harry.
No!

Señor Cienfuegos, uh,
the party is still happening.
I will look after the fireworks.
Sky is here, and these
are my other two dads.
Of course, it takes
three great men
to create such a woman.
It's a pleasure
to be of service.
Wow.
My God, Sophie.
Look what you've done
with the place.
She wanted
to make her mum proud.
As if she hasn't
done that all her life.
Excuse me a minute.
<i>Here's to us.</i>
May the rest of our lives
be the best of our lives.
- Ooh. Cheers.
- Mm-hmm.

- Oh.
Which one?
Oh, yeah,
that's the big question.
- What?
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

Ooh, definitely not.
I'll have some more.

That farmhouse on the hill
you're sleeping in,
who you think own it?
I...
I do. Me.
Yeah, I know it's run-down,
but my...
son is no help.
He put all his energy
into that horrible band.
They're a great band.
Your ears are cloth.
But, uh, if you live there
and make it beautiful,
you can stay for free.
Donna, seriously, don't.
There is a whole world
out there.
There's one right here.
I'd love to stay.
I'd love nothing more.
And I could do
amazing things with it.
You know, maybe one day,
it could be a hotel.
It could be incredible.
But you hardly know me.
Because I judge a person's heart
by the way they treat animal.
And you are kind to Hector,
my horse.
And your son.
Who is also an animal.
I'm overwhelmed. I...
I don't...
Excuse me just one second.
Well, I did say
that that mutaka smelled funny.
- "Moussaka."
- Bless you.
Okay.
Think we know what that means.
Soph. There you are.
I've just been speaking
to this guy.
He's actually a journalist,
and he wants to write
about this place for his blog,
which means
- it could be the start...
- I don't care.
No, I know you keep saying that,
- but actually it'll...
- Sky. Listen to me.
What?
I have never felt closer
to my mom.
I know.
It's being in this place with
her photos on the walls and...
I'm pregnant.
What?
In exactly the same place
that she was.
Only this time we know
who the father is.
- Soph, you're pregnant?
- Yeah.
I am.
And I have you
and my three dads,
and she had nobody.
She didn't even have
anybody to tell.
She must have been so scared.
All right. Bye.
- Mwah!
- Bye!
<i>She wasn't scared.
I know that now.</i>
<i>She knew that she could do it,</i>
<i>because she wasn't alone.</i>
She had me.
And you have me.
Oh, we can't tell anybody
about the baby.
We have to wait until
at least the 12-week scan.
Right.
- What is that?
- What?
That noise.

You're at the party,
but you're not in the party.
I've been dancing.
Just not with you.
Dance with me now.
And never, ever stop.
I gave you your chance, Bill.
I'm asking you for one more.
Well... it's just not
gonna work, is it,
if you haven't learned
from the first time.
Oh, believe me
when I say I have.
I never believe you, Bill.
Your pants are a raging wildfire
that cannot be contained.
Not anymore. I-I've changed.
For that to ever happen,
something would have to really
break down your barricades,
force you to feel
some real pain and loss
for the first time
in your shallow playboy life.
And that is never gonna happen.
So all we can be now is friends.
And you're just gonna have
to start getting used to that.
You're very strong, Rosie.
Finally.
She'd have really loved
all this, wouldn't she?
- Who?
- Donna.
Oh, my love.
Oh, no. Come. Come here.
Aw.

♪ I can't do ♪
♪ Without you... ♪ - Mmm.
Come on, this way.
- Just keep walking.
- You better not have
some kind of surprise lined up.
No, not at all.
- No. Why?
- I hate surprises.
I thought you loved surprises.
Yeah, but it's already
too much...
the party not happening
and then happening
and then you showing up
and the pregnancy.
- It's all amazing, but...
- Watch out.
I'm so incredibly,
crazy overwhelmed right now
that I don't want anything
remotely shocking
or-or different to happen
in the next decade.
Yes...
What?
Too late.
<i>Mes enfants, je suis arrivé.</i>
Let the party commence.
Grandma?
You weren't invited.
That's the best kind of party,
little girl.
So, Sky got you here.
No, Sky just helped it happen.
You got me here.
What do you mean?
I've decided to commit
to being...
"a grandmother."
It's 25 years too late.
I say we move past that.
You know, Soph, being
a grudge holder makes you fat.
So let's just concentrate
on the here and now
and me stepping up
to becoming a good grandmother.
A great grandmother.
Thank you.
No, he's saying that...
Wait. How do you know?
- Sky?
- I didn't say anything.
We agreed. Soph...
I only told Sam
because he's my stepfather,
and also one third
of my real father.
I just told Bill.
He's my best friend.
And I told Harry.
He's father number three.
I told many, many people.
Excuse us, ladies and gentlemen.
Rosie and I would like
to propose a toast
to the woman
of this and every hour.
Yes.
You're too kind.
- They mean Sophie.
- I know that.
Come on up, Sophie.
Soph!
I just want to say,
for a while now,
I have been living
my mother's wishes,
and tonight they've come true.
With this...
and with this.
Great-grandmother.
I'll be leaving that
out of the bio.
And now I can fulfill
one of my greatest wishes.
Ever since I-I was a child,
I've wanted once, just once,
to be a part
of Donna and the Dynamos.
You're gonna be so great.
Do it for your mom, baby.

You gotta work
on your breathing,

Is what I would say
if I wasn't a loving relative.
Speaking as a grandmother?
I'm so proud I could combust.
You've got glitter
in your veins.
You got it from me.
Now, I need to find Sky,
because he and I
were gonna talk about you.
Where is Señor Cienfuegos?
He'll know where Sky is.
Cienfuegos?
That's an unusual name.
He's an unusual man.
See for yourself.
Ruby!
Fernando?

I'm just saying, he has my ears.
And I'm just asking
why you care.
- Don't care. Absolutely don't.
- Good.
We're all three of us
grandfathers, and that's that.
- It's fine.
- Yes, it's fine.
It's just, over the years,
people have tended to be
extremely complimentary
- about my ears.
- Oh, yeah?
People have
complimented your ears?
To such an extent that I hope
he's inherited them.
- The boy?
- Yes.
- Donny?
- That's right.
Well, he does have lovely ears,
but I've also noticed
that he has rather piercing
blue eyes.
- Really?
- Yeah.
What about
his beautifully shaped feet?
- Huh?
- You're not taking your shoes off.
- Ah...
- Hey!
That walk gets longer
every time we do it.
Yeah, but it's worth it
for what's at the top.
Fine, rub my tired,
single nose in it.
- Hi. Ciao.
- Ciao.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Well, you two look
obscenely happy.
She has turned my frown
upside down.
<i>Eso no es el único
que he levante.</i>
<i>Ah, sí.</i> Yes.
Oh, and I'd like
to introduce you
to the other great love
of my life,
my brother,
Don Raphael Cienfuegos.
Oh, God,
I hope his wife is dead.
Alas, she is, and I fear I shall
never find happiness again.
Think again, brother.
Come on, everybody.
Let's do this.
You look beautiful, Ruby.
A day to remember, huh?
I wish she was here.
She is.
