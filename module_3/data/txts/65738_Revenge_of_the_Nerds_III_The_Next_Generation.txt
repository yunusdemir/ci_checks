your sorority house?
That's the first time
I saw you naked.
- Oh. Oh, Lewis.
- Lew.

A little exercise
never hurt anybody, huh?
Well, all right then.

- Stop it! Ow!
<i>Hey! Ow!</i>
We want you to look good

I thought we'd put
these times behind us.
Prejudice never goes away.
It just lays at the bottom
of the swamp like pond scum...
waiting for its moment
to come to the surface like pocker flies.
- What's a pocker fly?
- A devious insect...
whose larvae lie dormant
for an indeterminate gestation period...
till they give birth
without forewarning.
Man, sorry I asked.
What are we
gonna do about this?
I say we lay low,
build a cluster bomb...
and blow the Alpha Betas
to their maker.
Violence only breeds
more violence.
- So?
- Ira's right.
We've gotta work
within the system.
Things are different than they used to be.
We nerds control the campus now.
We've gotta use that power.
Malcolm, you're president of the Greek Council.
Can't you do anything?
Yes, I can.
Toyota, you're editor
of the school paper.
I think it's time we saw
a little editorial on our new dean.
It'd be my pleasure.
It's time for us
to flex our muscles.
There isn't a muscle
in this room.
Well, let's flex the greatest
muscle of all- our brains.
[Nerdy Laughing]
As president
of the Greek Council...
I move that the Alpha Beta fraternity
be placed on social probation.
All in favor?
Uh, not.
- Alpha Betas hurt nerds!
- Make them stop!
- Alpha Betas hurt nerds!
- Make them stop!
- <i>Alpha Betas hurt nerds!</i>
- <i>Make them stop!</i>
- It doesn't even rhyme.
- That's not the point, Bobo.
- <i>Make them stop!</i>
- <i>Alpha Betas hurt nerds!</i>
[Sighs] They printed my scores
on the police boards.
I didn't think
I did that badly.
How'd they get that information?
It's supposed to be private.
They're nerds. With their advanced
knowledge of computers...
they can get any
information they want.
Well, Dean Gable, it's time
we take off the gloves.
It's time we start
some nerd bashing.
I'm with you
all the way, Orrin.
Let's let

You are being impaired.
- Impeached.

Ow.
<i>[Toyota] Well, so much</i>
<i>for flexing our muscles.</i>
It's time for us to play our trump card,
our ace in the hole.
- We're gonna nuke 'em?
- Better.
We're gonna appeal to someone
who can really help us...
a man who many years ago fought
the battle for nerd rights.
I'd leave well enough alone.
If things get any more well around here,
Mr. Skolnick, we'll all be dead.
Well, you gotta understand
something, kids.
These things are tricky.
You wouldn't want to create a backlash.
<i>Create</i> a backlash?
We've already been lashed.
All right. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll talk to Dean Gable personally.
- We've already talked to him, Uncle Lewis.
- Lew.
Harold, you have to understand.
Dean Gable and I are like this.
So, Stan, you really haven't
heard anything about it?
Certainly not.
But I'll tell you this.
I'm sure as heck gonna
get to the bottom of it right away.
- Will you really?
- Certainly will.
There's no place for injustice
in the Gable administration.
- That's just what I knew you'd say.
- This is for you to sign.
What am I signing?
Those are the monthly
appropriations requests. It's nothing.
Ruth, what am I supposed
to do today anyway?
Well, where should I begin? Since you
became dean, you haven't done anything.
Well, you don't just
rush into these things.
Well, your budget
is due next Monday.
Budget. I haven't
even looked at it yet.
- How am I supposed to get it done by Monday?
- I don't know.
Especially since you have a symposium
on educational administration this weekend.
- Do I have to write a speech?
- It would help. Unless you're gonna wing it.
Would you like me
to help you write a speech?
- Would you, Lew?
- It would be my pleasure.
Stan, you know,
I don't mean to be blunt...
but you're never gonna make it
as dean unless you learn to use a computer.
- [Laughs] Me use a computer?
- That's right.
Now, Stan, the computer
is your friend.
Well, what do I do?
Well, you start
by cleaning it up.
[Vacuum Whirring]
Then you put in
a floppy disk.
- A what?
- Floppy disk.
- Then you turn it on.

You don't really believe that?
Why shouldn't I?
Because Gable's shinin' you on.
It's a smoke screen.
It's a sham.
These things are wrong.
They should be taken care of right now.
Harold, I understand.
I was full of spit and vinegar
when I was your age.
You just got to be patient.
Sometimes it takes a while for the system
to correct mistakes.
Well, I'm not
just gonna stand by...
and watch my brothers
be abused and persecuted.
I'm gonna do something
about this now.
Harold, I wouldn't rock the boat.
You might just tip it over.
What's happened to you,
Uncle Lewis?
- Lew.
- I don't know who you are anymore.

- Mr. Skolnick.
- Ira, call me Lewis.
Lewis. We are receiving tremendous
nerd support from all across the city.
That's wonderful.
Get on the modems...
and contact all the ex-Tri-Lambs
across the country.
I want them here
for the nerd-in.
Mr. Skolnick?
- <i>[Shutter Clicks]</i>
- <i>[Crowd Cheering]</i>
- [Feedback]
- They call us nerds...
because we've always
been nice to people.
- [Crowd Cheers]
- <i>They call us nerds...</i>
- <i>because we get good grades.</i>
- [Crowd Cheers]
They call us nerds because we treat
our parents with respect.
- [Crowd Cheers]
- Well, they're right.
- We're nerds.
- <i>[Man] We're nerds!</i>
And we're very wet,
and we're very upset.
<i>[Crowd Cheers]</i>
We're nerds. We're wet.
We're very, very upset.
We're nerds! We're wet!
We're very, very upset!
We're nerds! We're wet!
We're very, very upset!
- <i>We're nerds! We're wet!</i>
- He's right.
- Let's take these off.
- <i>We're very, very upset!</i>
- <i>[Chanting Continues]</i>
- Isn't this great?
The old gang isn't coming.
They live all over the country.
They have their own problems
and their own lives.
Yeah, but they know
I sold out.
Even my ex-best friend, Gilbert,
knows I'm a traitor to our people.
We're wet!
We're very, very upset!
<i>We're nerds! We're wet!</i>
<i>We're very, very upset!</i>
- [Chanting Continues]
- Hey, Gable. Boo!
We're nerds! We're wet!
We're very, very upset!
Ladies and gentlemen,
look who finally decided to show up.
Our dean, Stan Harvey Gable.
[Booing, Hissing]
You nerds have ruined my life.
How'd we do that, Stanley?
I used to be
a big man on campus...
until you humiliated me
at the pep rally.
Then you stole Betty away from me.
[Panting]
<i>After that, not another living soul ever</i>
<i>respected me again.</i>
You're such a victim, Stan, aren't you?
<i>Maybe you ought to start taking</i>
<i>responsibility for your actions...</i>
instead of blaming all your faults
and failures on others.
Uhh! Get! Get!
- [Crowd Cheering]
- <i>[Man] Gable, you jerk!</i>
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Gable is unable!</i>
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>Get off the campus, Gable!</i>
<i>[Cheering,</i>
<i>Shouting Continues]</i>
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Not a friend to nerds!</i>
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- [Sighs]
The campus police
have joined the strike.
They're everywhere. It seems as if
you shake anyone's family tree...
a couple of nerds will drop out.
Maybe we should
try and negotiate.
I don't negotiate with nerds.
Well, what are we gonna do,
Orrin?
The press is gonna have
a field day with this.
I'm gonna be the laughingstock
of the entire country.
The school is paralyzed. There's no
telephones, no electricity, no gas.
It's like Baghdad around here!
Shut up!
We destroy Lewis Skolnick, the rest of those
nerds will fall like a deck of cards.
How would you destroy him?
By revealing his misuse
of Adams College funds.
Lewis has been misusing
Adams funds?
Remember those papers
I had you have him sign?
- Yeah.
- Well, Lewis doesn't know it...
but I've been using part
of his monthly appropriation...
to get things that I think
the college needs.
Like what?
Like procuring women for the football players,
new yacht, Lear jet-
things the school needs.
Well, why didn't you
tell me about this?
- I didn't think that was necessary.
- Not necessary?
I'm the dean!
Come on, Stan.
We both know what you are.
[Chuckles]
And if you want to stay the dean,
you'll keep your mouth shut.
You could ruin him for life.
I know. Terrible, isn't it?
[Laughing]
<i>[Steam Hissing]</i>
<i>[Whirring]</i>
<i>[Stan]</i>
<i>You have any eights?</i>
- Go fish.
- Hmm.
We've broken their backs.
They're all returning to work.
Great. Uh, got an eight.
He did it for sure.
How else did he get that Beemer?
- This is a lie.
- Of course it is.
- I didn't know anything about this.
- Of course you didn't.
- I can't believe they pulled this.
- Of course you can't.
You were right, Betty.
I was a fool.
Stan was duping me all along.
I'm gonna be ruined now.
Everything I've worked for my whole life
is gonna be destroyed.
No matter what happens,
we still have each other.
Betty.
[Clears Throat] Excuse me,
but as your attorney, I've got to know.
Did you do it?
I mean, it's cool if you did.
I'd have done it myself if I'd had the chance.
I'm just curious.
No, I didn't do it!
I'm innocent!
Of course you are.
[All] Adams college blew it!
Lewis didn't do it!
Adams college blew it!
Lewis didn't do it!
Adams college blew it!

- <i>[Knock On Door]</i>
- [Beeps]
One second.
Come in.
Betty.
What are you doing here?
He thought you were
his friend, Stan.
Well, who has friends?
Everybody uses everybody else.
Nobody has friends.
Lewis does.
Oh, yeah, sure.
He had a lot of friends during the strike.
But where are they now?
You know he's innocent, Stan.
I want you to tell the truth
and get Lewis released.
You really love
this guy, don't you?
He means everything to me.
I'd do anything to save him.
Anything?
Is that what you want, Stan?
No.
I don't want it like that, Betty.
Believe it or not, I still
have a little pride left.
- [Woman] Come over here. Did you get that?
- [Crowd Chattering]
Mr. Dawson,
any more nose-picking...
and I'll hold you in contempt.
Your witness.
Thank you, Your Honor.
<i>Mr. Gable...</i>
how did you get your job?
I applied for the job, and I got it.
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
Were you qualified to be dean?
Sure. Yeah.
I arrested a lot of kids...
when I was with
the highway patrol...
<i>did a lot of volunteer work with the police</i>
<i>athletic league-stufflike that.</i>
<i>Well, that certainly qualifies you...</i>
to be the dean of a major college.
<i>What was your</i>
<i>grade point average, Stan?</i>
- I had a "C" average.
- "C"?
Was it not in fact a C-minus...
<i>just this side</i>
<i>of the D-plus border?</i>
Yeah!
I don't see what my grade point has to do
with this case.
Just answer the question,
Mr. Gable!
I agree with the witness,
Mr. Dawson.
I don't see what
his grade point has to do...
with that nerd
embezzling funds.
- [Spectators Murmuring]
- <i>[Booger] Your Honor, I intend to prove...</i>
that there were
shenanigans involved...
<i>in the very appointment</i>
<i>of Stan Gable...</i>
- as dean of Adams college.
- Overruled.
Dean Gable isn't
the one on trial here.
Your Honor, this line of questioning...
is the cornerstone
for my entire defense.
Overruled.
Well-Well, I call for a mistrial.
Clearly my client
can't get a fair trial...
in this anti-nerd atmosphere.
- Yeah!
- Overruled!
- Come on. Please, Your Honor?
- Any more outbursts, Mr. Dawson...
and I'll throw your whole damn gaggle
of nerds in jail for contempt!
- [Sighs]
- [Murmuring]
Yeah, right.
- [Clears Throat] Mr. Gable-
- Yes?
When did you learn...
of my client's <i>alleged</i> misuse
of Adams college funds?
- Just recently.
- Oh, well, wasn't that a coincidence?
<i>That you should discover this...</i>
at the very height of a nerd strike
led by Lewis Skolnick-
<i>A strike which threatened</i>
<i>to topple...</i>
your tower
of totalitarian tyranny!
Yeah!
- <i>[Judge] Quiet!</i>
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Quiet!
Silence in my court!
<i>Mr. Dawson, I'm warning you.</i>
- <i>I've had it with you.</i>
- Psst!
Dad!
Who is this geek
in my courtroom?
- I thought you were on your honeymoon.
- Well, your stepmother and I...
have the rest of our lives
for honeymooning.
We want to be here to support you.
We're behind you 100%.
I'm really glad you're here.
I need all the help I can get.
- Well, son, I believe help's on the way.
- What do you mean?
Free Lewis! Nerd power!
- Lamar!
- Lewis!
Order! I demand order!
- [Laughing]
- So what are you doing?
Well, I live in Milan now.
I'm a model.
You know- strike a pose.
Oh, what is that?
- Wormser.
- What is a Wormser?
When a Tri-Lamb's in trouble,
I'm there.
[Nerdy Laugh]
You're so grown up.
- And so handsome.
- [Laughs]
- Are you married?
- Better.
I'm a gynecologist.
Your Honor, this is a mockery
of the judicial system!
- Silence!
- Banzai! Flee Rewis!
Takashi?
- [Laughing]
- [Nerdy Laughing]
U.N.
We're here, baby.
Power to the nerds! Yeah!
[Cheering]
<i>Quiet! I've lost control.</i>
- Lewis, good to see you.
- Oh, U.N., thank you for being here.
- Oh, this is so wonderful.
- I know. If only-
Gilbert!
Hi, Lewis.
Gilbert.
I can't believe you're here.
I thought you never wanted
to speak to me again.
I didn't.
But... I heard
you were a nerd again.
Forever this time.
- [Laughs]
- [Nerdy Laughing]
[Cheering]
- <i>[Gavel Banging]</i>
- <i>Order!</i>
Order!
- Your Honor-
- I demand order!
- Your Honor-
- What is it?
I'd like to make a statement.
Lewis Skolnick had no idea
what was going on.
<i>Are you saying this nerd</i>
<i>is innocent?</i>
- Yes.
- [Spectators Gasping]
Yes. The money was misappropriated
by Orrin Price.
- This is preposterous!
- You're worse than they are, Price!
Lewis, I'd like to be your friend.
<i>Seeing you here with the rest of your</i>
<i>Tri-Lamb brothers and sisters-</i>
Well, it makes me see
what real friendship is all about.
<i>My whole life</i>
<i>I've hated your kind.</i>
When really I-
I hated myself.
<i>And as I sat last night</i>
<i>at the computer...</i>
I realized that-
that I was a nerd.
<i>Yeah. And that there's</i>
<i>a little bit of nerd in everyone.</i>
I guess I was just afraid to face that part
of myself, but now I'm not.
I'm a nerd- trapped in a beautiful body,
but I'm a nerd nonetheless.
You're not a nerd!
You're an idiot!
Idiots are people too,
Orrin.
<i>It's not how smart you are</i>
<i>or how good-looking you are...</i>
<i>or how much money</i>
<i>you make.</i>
It's what's in your heart
that counts.
<i>I'm sorry, Lewis.</i>
I'm so sorry.
I just hope that one day you'll be able
to forgive me for what I've done to you.
I love you, Stan.
Oh, brother.
You guys want to be alone?
[All]
Shut up, Price!
<i>I'd also like to point out...</i>
that it was Orrin Price that planted
the marijuana in the Tri-Lamb house...
<i>and that the Tri-Lambs are completely</i>
<i>innocent of all charges.</i>
Whoo!
Bailiff, handcuff that man.
Oh, I'm gonna get even with you, Gable.
You can bet on it!
I'll get even with all you nerds!
<i>[Laughing]</i>
Does this mean I win?
Case dismissed.
[Laughing]
Booger!
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Greatjob. Greatjob. Greatjob.</i>
<i>[Malcolm]</i>
<i>Congratulations.</i>
- Oh, man. [Sighs]
- Oh! Oh!
Stan, I am so proud of you.
Oh, it feels so great
to come out of the closet.
I have always had these feelings
ever since I was a little kid.
I always wanted to read
and get good grades...
but my parents, they just wanted me
to be popular and play sports.
Oh! You don't have
to pretend anymore.
- Yeah.
- I'll tell you what, Stan.
I'm gonna work my tail off...
- to see to it that you get to stay on as dean.
- We all are.
We need as many nerds
in power as we can get.
Right! Right!
- Yes! Oh.
- Hey.
- Lewis.
- Betty.
I love you so much,
you big nerd.
I know I am,
but what are you?
A nerd lover.
Oh, Betty.
- Oh!
- Oh!
