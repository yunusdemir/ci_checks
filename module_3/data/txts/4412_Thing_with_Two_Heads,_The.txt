EXCELLENT.

IT KNOWS ME.

DOCTOR, I WOULDN'T
GET TOO CLOSE
IF I WERE YOU.
DON'T BE ABSURD, DONALD.
HE TRUSTS ME...
AND HE NEEDS ME.
AFTER ALL,
WE UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER.
I AM THE GENIUS THAT
HAS GIVEN HIM A NEW LIFE.
AND HE, IN RETURN,
WILL HELP ME KEEP MINE.

ARTERIAL CLAMP, PLEASE.
A LITTLE MORE PERFUSION.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS ONE
OF OUR 3 OPERATING
FACILITIES.
THE KIRSHNER
TRANSPLANT FOUNDATION
IS THE ONLY PLACE
IN THE WORLD
WHERE SUCH A MASSIVE
OPERATION CAN TAKE PLACE.
WHERE SUCH A MASSIVE
OPERATION CAN TAKE PLACE.
Reporter: DR. SMITH,
IN SUCH A MASSIVE TRANSPLANT,
WHY DON'T WE
SEE MORE BLOOD?
THAT'S BECAUSE
AT THIS MOMENT,
BOTH THE PATIENT
AND THE DONOR ORGANS
ARE HOOKED UP TO INDIVIDUAL
HEART-LUNG MACHINES.
THEY CONTROL THE BLOOD FLOW
THROUGH THOSE PLASTIC TUBES.
THEY CONTROL THE BLOOD FLOW
THROUGH THOSE PLASTIC TUBES.
IS THAT DR. KIRSHNER
ON THE PLATFORM?
YES. DR. KIRSHNER
SUPERVISES THE MAJOR
TRANSPLANT OPERATIONS.
DOES HE EVER OPERATE HIMSELF?
NO, UH...NOT ANYMORE.
HE DEVELOPED A SEVERE
ARTHRITIC CONDITION
A YEAR OR SO AGO,
AND, WELL,
IT MAKES SURGERY QUITE
DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
IT MAKES SURGERY QUITE
DIFFICULT FOR HIM.
P.A.: DR. THOMAS,
X-RAY, PLEASE.
P.A.: DR. THOMAS,
X-RAY, PLEASE.
PHILIP, WALK ME
TO THE DOOR, WILL YOU?
SURE, MAX.
I'M LEAVING EARLY
TODAY.
NOW, THE ONLY THING LEFT
ON THE SCHEDULE
IS A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT,
RIGHT?
RIGHT.
I SEE NO PROBLEMS
THERE, DO YOU?
I DON'T.
WELL, YOU AND HERSCH
TAKE CARE OF IT,
AND I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.
BY THE WAY, THAT WAS
A PRETTY GOOD JOB
IN THERE TODAY,
YOU AND THE TEAM.
THANK YOU. I DIDN'T
THINK YOU'D NOTICED.
I SAID GOOD.
I DIDN'T SAY EXCELLENT.
[CHUCKLES]
[CHUCKLES]
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NOW,
DOCTOR?
THEY'RE GETTING WORSE.
AND MORE FREQUENT.
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
WE CAN DO.
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
I CAN'T TAKE ANY DRUGS.
I MUST KEEP MY MIND ALERT.
I'M SORRY, THOMAS,
BUT IT'S DIFFICULT.

I HAVEN'T
GOT MUCH TIME.
MOVE!
MOVE!
HE CAN'T HAVE GOTTEN
TOO FAR, COULD HE?
HE CAN'T HAVE GOTTEN
TOO FAR, COULD HE?
Donald: LOOK AT THAT.
Donald: LOOK AT THAT.
THIS MONITOR
WILL DISCARD ORGANS
THAT ARE MALFUNCTIONING
BEYOND WHAT
THE HUMAN EYE CAN DETECT.
YOUNG MAN, YOU REALIZE
WE OPERATE HERE
ON A SUCCESS AVERAGE
OF 92%?
CAN YOUR MACHINE
IMPROVE ON THAT?
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
DR. KIRSHNER.
DR. WILLIAMS HAS ARRIVED.
YOU ASKED ME TO LET YOU KNOW
AS SOON AS HE GOT HERE.
SHOW HIM IN HERE,
WILL YOU?
DR. WILLIAMS?
I INSTRUCTED THE BOARD TO
HIRE HIM WITHOUT AN INTERVIEW.
HE'S DONE
SOME INTERESTING WORK
ON REJECTION PREVENTION.
WELL, OF COURSE.
I'VE READ ABOUT HIM.
HE'S EXCELLENT.
HE'S EXCELLENT.
Miss Davis:
THIS IS DR. WILLIAMS.
DR. DESMOND.
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.
PHIL DESMOND,
HEAD OF SURGERY.
THIS IS
JIM FRANKLYN.
HI. HOW ARE YOU?
FINE.
Miss Davis:
AND THIS IS DR. KIRSHNER.
Miss Davis:
AND THIS IS DR. KIRSHNER.
DR. KIRSHNER,
IT'S A PLEASURE
MEETING YOU, SIR,
AND I'M VERY HAPPY
TO BE ON YOUR STAFF.
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN?
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
DR. WILLIAMS...
YES, SIR?
YES, SIR?
HOW WAS THE TRIP
FROM MINNEAPOLIS?
VERY PLEASANT,
THANK YOU.
VERY PLEASANT,
THANK YOU.
UH...DOCTOR...
SINCE ORIGINALLY
HIRING YOU, UH...
CERTAIN SITUATIONS
WHICH WE WERE DEPENDING UPON
HAVEN'T ARISEN.
DUE TO BUDGETARY SETBACKS,
WE FIND THAT WE ARE UNABLE
TO USE YOUR SERVICES.
BUT WE SIGNED A CONTRACT,
AND I'VE ALREADY GIVEN UP
MY POSITION IN MINNEAPOLIS.
MISS DAVIS...
CHECK THE TERMS
OF HIS CONTRACT.
IT'S FOR A 6-MONTH
TRIAL PERIOD
AT 500 PER WEEK.
THE BOARD
WAS MOST GENEROUS.
THE BOARD
WAS MOST GENEROUS.
I'VE BEEN A PHYSICIAN
FOR OVER 5 YEARS.
I WAS MAKING
MUCH MORE THAN THAT
IN MINNEAPOLIS.
OH, COME NOW, DR. WILLIAMS.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT AT ALL.
WHAT I MEANT WAS,
IT'S JUST THAT HERE WE
PAY OUR LAB MEN MUCH LESS.
I'M MUCH MORE
THAN A LAB MAN, SIR.
I'M A DOCTOR.
LET'S NOT BARGAIN, DOCTOR.
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?
WHAT I WANTED WAS TO WORK
WITH MAXWELL KIRSHNER,
ONE OF THE FOREMOST
TRANSPLANT SPECIALISTS
IN THE WORLD.
WHY IS IT YOU PEOPLE ALWAYS
PUT YOURSELF IN A POSITION
WHERE YOU--
WHERE YOU DON'T FIT?
BUT, MAX,
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
BUT, MAX,
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.
WHY IS IT ALL OF
A SUDDEN THAT, UH...
I DON'T FIT?
I'LL GET SOME COFFEE,
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THIS
THING SOME OTHER TIME.
YES, WHY DON'T
YOU DO THAT?
YES, UH, I'LL DO THAT.
YES, UH, I'LL DO THAT.
WHY DON'T WE STOP
PLAYING AROUND, DOCTOR?
THINGS
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT
IF I WERE WHITE,
RIGHT?
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY--
THIS ISMYHOSPITAL.
I RUN ITMYWAY.
I HIRE WHOM I PLEASE...
AND I DON'T WISH
TO HIRE YOU.
OH, NO.
LET'S PUT IT
THIS WAY--
WE HAVE A LEGAL
AND BINDING CONTRACT,
AND I INTEND TO SEE YOU
FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER.
AND I INTEND TO SEE YOU
FOLLOW IT TO THE LETTER.
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR,
YOU'LL HAVE YOUR 6 MONTHS.
BUT THAT WILL BE IT!
REPORT TO DR. HERSCH
FOR SCHEDULING.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
6 MONTHS
WILL BE LONG ENOUGH.
I'LL WATCH YOU,
AND I'LL LEARN.
THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE FOR.
AND WHEN I'VE LEARNED
WHAT YOU KNOW,
I'LL FIT MYSELF
IN SOMEWHERE ELSE.
I'LL FIT MYSELF
IN SOMEWHERE ELSE.
MAX, THAT
WASN'T NECESSARY.
WHAT IS OR WHAT
IS NOT NECESSARY
IN THIS HOSPITAL
IS MY AFFAIR.
AS YOU KNOW,
I NEVER ALLOW COLORED PEOPLE
ON MY PERSONAL STAFF.
I JUST GOT CARRIED AWAY BY
SUPERFICIAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS
BEFORE INTERVIEWING THE MAN.
WHETHER
HE'S BLACK OR NOT,
HE'S
AN EXCELLENT DOCTOR.
[SIGHS] PHILIP,
DO ME A FAVOR, WILL YOU?
COVER FOR ME TODAY.
I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT THINGS
TO DO AT HOME.
I HAVE SOME IMPORTANT THINGS

TELL HIM IT'S URGENT.
I WANT TO SEE HIM HERE
IMMEDIATELY.
I WANT TO SEE HIM HERE
IMMEDIATELY.
MAX, WHAT IS IT?
HELLO, PHILIP.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
MY CONDITION
IS TERMINAL CHEST CANCER.
PROGNOSIS...
I HAVE 2 OR 3 WEEKS
TO LIVE, AT THE MOST.
I HAVE 2 OR 3 WEEKS
TO LIVE, AT THE MOST.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME THIS?
THERE WAS NO POINT
IN TELLING YOU.
YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT, ANYWAY.
WELL, IN YOUR OWN CASE,
I DOUBT IF
YOU'RE THE BEST JUDGE.
LET'S GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL
AND START WORKING.
DONALD...
SHOW HIM THE X-RAYS.
SHOW HIM THE X-RAYS.
Max: THAT WAS TAKEN
OVER 3 MONTHS AGO.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE CONDITION WAS INOPERABLE
AT THAT TIME.
PROGRESSION
HAS GONE PAST THE LUNGS
AND INTO THE PLEURAL CAVITY
AND THE RIB CAGE.
ORGAN TRANSPLANTING
WOULD BE FUTILE.
AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO
AGREE WITH YOU.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN
DO TO MAKE IT EASIER?
YES, THERE IS.
DONALD, SHOW HIM.
DONALD, SHOW HIM.
THAT IS NOT THE GORILLA'S
ORIGINAL HEAD.
HE'S HEAVILY SEDATED NOW.
BUT WE HAVE ACHIEVED 100%
TOTAL SPINAL ALIGNMENT
ON THE NEWLY
TRANSPLANTED HEAD.
ON THE NEWLY
TRANSPLANTED HEAD.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IS IT?
HEART, LUNGS,
KIDNEYS, ARMS, LEGS--
EVERYTHING
IS FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS.
TOP ONE.
TOP ONE.
I KEPT THE ORIGINAL BODY
AND THE TRANSPLANTED HEAD ALIVE
ON 2 SEPARATE
HEART-LUNG MACHINES.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.
EXACTLY.
TOTAL SPINAL ALIGNMENT
ACHIEVED
BY USING MATCHING
ELECTRIC CURRENTS
ATTACHED TO THE NERVE ENDINGS.
I LEFT THE 2 HEADS TOGETHER
FOR 28 DAYS,
UNTIL THE NEW ONE WAS
STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE OVER.
THE REMOVAL OPERATION
WAS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
I DID IT MYSELF.
ALONE...
IN 35 MINUTES.
IN 35 MINUTES.
THIS COULD REVOLUTIONIZE
THE WHOLE PROFESSION.
I'LL GET A PAPER
ON IT RIGHT AWAY.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
WE'VE GOT TO GO MUCH FURTHER.
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
I'M TALKING ABOUT SCIENCE,
ABOUT GENIUS.
GENIUS MUST BE PROLONGED.
PHILIP, I WANT TO TRANSPLANT
MY HEAD ON A HEALTHY BODY.
PHILIP, I WANT TO TRANSPLANT
MY HEAD ON A HEALTHY BODY.
WELL?
WELL?
WELL?
WELL?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHATDON'T YOU KNOW?
IT HASN'T BEEN PROVEN.
THEN WE'LL PROVE IT NOW.
MY GENIUS MUST BE ALLOWED
TO CONTINUE.
PHILIP, I HAVE NOTHING,
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO LOSE.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
FOR ME TO LIVE.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY
FOR ME TO LIVE.
I GUESS THERE ISN'T.
OF COURSE, WE'LL NEED A DONOR,
PERHAPS SOMEONE WITH
AN INOPERABLE BRAIN CONDITION,
WITH A BODY
THAT CANNOT BE SAVED,
BUT IT'S HEALTHY ENOUGH
TO WITHSTAND THE OPERATION
UNTIL WE CAN
REMOVE THE OTHER HEAD.
THAT WON'T BE EASY, MAX.
SUCH A PATIENT ONLY COMES
ALONG ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE.
PERFORM THE OPERATION HERE,
IN SECRET.
THE FEWER PEOPLE
WHO KNOW ABOUT THIS,
THE LESS OUR CHANCE OF
TROUBLE WITH PUBLIC OPINION.
PHILIP, YOU'VE
GOTTO HELP ME.
PHILIP, YOU'VE
GOTTO HELP ME.
WELL, AS YOU SAID, MAX,
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO LOSE.
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO LOSE.
NO, NO. HIS BRAIN MUST
BE TOTALLY INOPERABLE.
KIRSHNER INSTITUTE.
THAT'S CORRECT.
A CANCER PATIENT IS
OUT OF THE QUESTION.
WHAT TYPE
OF PATIENT IS IT?
BLOOD TYPE?
I'M SORRY.
THAT DOESN'T MATCH UP.
KIRSHNER INSTITUTE.
THE PATIENT MUST BE ABLE
TO SUSTAIN LIFE FOR
AT LEAST 30 T0 40 DAYS.
KIRSHNER INSTITUTE.
MAY I HELP YOU?
NO.THE BODY
HAS TO BE
FUNCTIONING
PROPERLY.
NO. I'M SORRY.
NOW, WHAT DOES
THE PATIENT HAVE?
KIRSHNER INSTITUTE.
NO GOOD, PATRICIA.
WE'VE HAD 2 POSSIBILITIES
IN THE LAST 4 WEEKS,
AND NEITHER MATCHED UP.
OH, I'M SORRY,
BUT A CANCER PATIENT
IS OUT OF THE QUESTION.

MAY I HELP YOU?

MAY I HELP YOU?
[INTERCOM BUZZES]
YES?

OH, FINE.

OH, FINE.
BRING HIM IN.
HEY, PHIL, IT'S
BEEN A LONG TIME.
MITCH. THANKS FOR SEEING ME
ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE.
ANYTIME.
GRAB A CHAIR.
THANK YOU.
SINCE I TALKED
TO YOU YESTERDAY,
I'VE COME UP
WITH A FEW ANSWERS.
OH? CAN YOU HELP US?
YOU SAID IT WAS URGENT,
SO I PULLED
A FEW STRINGS FOR YOU,
AND I TALKED
TO THE GOVERNOR,
AND I TALKED TO
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL,
AND, UH...
HERE'S THE DEAL.
FIRST,
WE CAN'T LET ANY OF THIS
LEAK TO THE PRESS.
WE'RE ALREADY
HAVING ENOUGH TROUBLE
WITH THESE EXECUTIONS
WITHOUT ADDING FUEL
TO THE FIRE.
YOU'VE GOT IT.
NEXT, THE CONVICT
MUST BE UNDER
TOTAL POLICE SECURITY
AT ALL TIMES,
AND PROOF
OF HIS SUBSEQUENT DEATH
MUST BE CERTIFIED
BY A STATE PHYSICIAN.
OF COURSE, WE'RE
ASSUMING SOME THINGS.
WE'RE ASSUMING THAT
SOMEONE ON DEATH ROW
WILL DECIDE TO DONATE
HIS BODY TO SCIENCE
RATHER THAN
GO TO THE CHAIR.
WELL, WE CAN ONLY HOPE.
TELL ME SOMETHING--
JUST OFF THE RECORD--
WHAT'S THIS EXPERIMENT
ABOUT?
TRANSPLANT, MITCH.
JUST ANOTHER TRANSPLANT.
JUST ANOTHER TRANSPLANT.

YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
DR. WILLIAMS, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.
DR. DESMOND HAS ASKED
 THAT YOU MEET WITH HIM,
AT DR. KIRSHNER'S,
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
AND HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
AND HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
ARE YOU SURE
HE ASKED FOR ME?
SPECIFICALLY.
SPECIFICALLY.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
DR. DESMOND.
OVER THERE.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
OH, DR. WILLIAMS.
UH, WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS LATER.
RIGHT.
DOCTOR, I'M SORRY
I HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE
TO TALK TO YOU
SINCE YOU STARTED
AT THE HOSPITAL.
IT'S REALLY NOT NECESSARY.
WELL, YES, IT IS.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.
I MEAN,
FOR DR. KIRSHNER.
SEE, HE'S NOT HAD
AN EASY LIFE.
EVEN HIS
CHILDHOOD WAS...
WELL, I CAN CERTAINLY
SYMPATHIZE WITH PEOPLE
WHO HAVE HAD
A DIFFICULTCHILDHOOD.
LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.
IT'S POSSIBLE
WE MAY BE MAKING
MEDICAL HISTORY
RIGHT HERE.
WE'LL KNOW
IN A WEEK OR SO.
WE'VE PERFORMED
A MASSIVE TRANSPLANT.
WE'RE EXPECTING SEVERE
REJECTION PROBLEMS.
QUITE HONESTLY,
I COULD USE YOUR HELP.
WHY ME?
BECAUSE OF YOUR
ANTI-REJECTION TECHNIQUES.
THEY COULD
COME IN HANDY.
COULD MEAN
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SUCCESS
AND FAILURE.
YOU'VE GOT THE BEST PEOPLE
FROM THE HOSPITAL HERE.
NOW, WHY ME?
AND ESPECIALLY HERE.
DOCTOR, I UNDERSTAND
YOUR PROBLEM.
BUT DID YOU EVER
STOP TO THINK
THAT MY VIEWS
MAY NOT BE THE SAME
AS DR. KIRSHNER'S?
NOW, WE'RE TESTING
24 HOURS A DAY.
YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR
AND AN EXCELLENT
LAB MAN.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
WILL YOU HELP ME?
WILL YOU HELP ME?
YES, DOCTOR.
I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO HELP.
THANK YOU.
NOW, I CAN'T DIVULGE
THE FULL NATURE
OF THE OPERATION AS YET.
YOU'LL HAVE
ENOUGH INFORMATION
TO DO YOUR JOB.
I WANT YOU TO GO HOME,
GET SOME THINGS.
THE ENTIRE STAFF
IS LIVING HERE.
DR. HERSCH WILL
ASSIGN YOU A ROOM.
THANK YOU.
THANKYOU.
THANKYOU.
WE HAVE A PATCH
OF PNEUMONIA.
THAT EXTRA DECADRON
IS GIVING US
ONE HELL OF A PROBLEM.
THE BODY JUST CAN'T
FIGHT INFECTION WITH IT.
CUT DOWN THE DOSAGE
OF BARBITAL
TO THE BLACK HEAD.
HE'S TOO FAR UNDER.
WE NEED ALL THE HELP
WE CAN GET FROM HIM.
RIGHT, DOCTOR.
RIGHT AWAY.
RIGHT, DOCTOR.
RIGHT AWAY.
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR 16 HOURS.
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO GET YOU A RELIEF?
OH, NO,
THANK YOU, NURSE.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
THANKS ANYWAY.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
THANKS ANYWAY.
HOW'S THE LYMPH COUNT?
IT'S BETTER, MUCH BETTER.
IN FACT,
IT'S FALLING SLOWLY.
GOOD.
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.
OK. SO, UH...
WHEN DO US HERE
ON THE OUTSIDE
REALLY GET TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE?
IT WON'T
BE LONG NOW.
IT WON'T
BE LONG NOW.
HOW ARE WE DOING?
WELL, THE PNEUMONIA'S
FINALLY STABLE.
NO IMPROVEMENT,
BUT, AT LEAST,
HE'S NO WORSE.
PHILIP, I THINK
WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE.
PHILIP, I THINK
WE MAY HAVE A CHANCE.
YOU'RE LATE
FOR THE INJECTION, NURSE.
I WAS ABOUT
TO LOOK FOR YOU.
NOW GET GOING.
SORRY, DOCTOR.
I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT.
SORRY, DOCTOR.

YOUR KIND

Max: WILLIAMS,

Moss: IF YOU DON'T DO IT,
THEN I GET RID OF HIM
MY WAY.
WILLIAMS.
THAT'D BE ABOUT
AS SMART
AS YOU JUMPING
OUT OF THIS CAR.
HOW IS THAT?
I MEAN THAT
IF YOU KILL HIM,
YOU'LL KILL YOURSELF.
THE ONLY WAY
TO ELIMINATE
HIS HEAD AND LIVE
IS THROUGH SURGERY.
IS THROUGH SURGERY.
OK. WE'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO DO IT RIGHT, THEN.
TO DO IT RIGHT, THEN.
Philip: THERE THEY ARE.
THANK GOD
YOU'RE SLOWING DOWN.
WELL, WE DON'T WANT
TO CATCH THEM.
WE JUST WANT TO
KEEP THEM IN SIGHT.
IF WE GET INTO TRAFFIC,
THERE MAY BE A POLICE CAR
AROUND SOMEWHERE.

WHAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE
DO YOU REQUIRE, 22?
[ENGINE WON'T START]
[ENGINE WON'T START]
WELL, A TOW TRUCK
WOULD BE NICE.
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
HELP ME OR NOT?
I TOLD YOU,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.
LISTEN, MAN.
I KNOW THE JURY, THE D.A.,
AND THE PAPERS
ALL SAY I'M GUILTY,
BUT BIG JACK
KNOWS THE TRUTH.
WELL, BIG JACK BETTER
STOP THIS INSANITY
AND GIVE HIMSELF UP
BEFORE WE'RE ALL KILLED.
WHAT'S THIS "WE" STUFF?
THEY'RE NOT AFTER YOU.
THEY'RE AFTER ME.
SO I'LL DO THE THINKING.
SO I'LL DO THE THINKING.
YOU SAID BACK THERE
THAT YOU WERE INNOCENT.
I AM.
THEY ALL SAY THAT.
SURE THEY DO,
BUT, IN MY CASE.
IT HAPPENS TO BE TRUE.
HECK, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA DO THIS TO ME.
I FIGURED I WAS
GONNA DIE ANYWAY,
SO WHAT THE HELL.
THEY TRANSPLANT
SOMETHING FROM MY BODY
MAKES A KID LIVE,
THAT'S GOOD.
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WAS GONNA DO THIS.
ANYWAY, I'M INNOCENT,
AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT.
SO, HOW ABOUT IT?
I TOLD YOU,
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.
YOU MEAN YOU'RE
ACTUALLY CONSIDERING
HELPING THIS
ESCAPED MURDERER?
MURDERER?
YOU'RE THE MURDERER,
TRYING TO CUT OFF MY HEAD.
THAT'S DIFFERENT.
[LAUGHS]
FUNNY HOW IT
BECOMES DIFFERENT
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR OWN HEAD.
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOUR OWN HEAD.
Williams: WHAT IS IT?
WE OBVIOUSLY
HAVE A FLAT.
WE OBVIOUSLY
HAVE A FLAT.
YOU GONNA STAY
WITH ME, DOC?
DO I HAVE A CHOICE?
NOPE. AT LEAST
NOT RIGHT NOW.
LET'S GO.

[OVER BULLHORN] MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE,
GROUND CONTROL.
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE OUT
ACROSS RIDGE 4.
PLEASE SPREAD OUT.
FOLLOW US IN A LINE,
AND WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN
HELP YOU SPOT HIM.
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
WHAT?
HOW'D YOU WIND UP
ON DEATH ROW?
OH. A COP GOT KILLED
WITH A GUN
I USED TO OWN
A FEW YEARS BACK.
IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
DIDN'T YOU HAVE AN ALIBI?
WILLIE THOMPSON.
WELL, WHO'S THAT?
CRAZY GUY I USED TO KNOW.
CAME KNOCKING ON MY DOOR
A FEW DAYS BEFORE
I GOT PICKED UP.
HE'D PULLED A JOB AND THE POLICE
HAD GOTTEN A MAKE ON HIM.
SO...HE NEEDED A PLACE
TO HIDE OUT.
IT'S INTERESTING
HOW CRIMINALS
ALWAYS SEEK OUT
OTHER CRIMINALS.
MAN, I AIN'T NO CRIMINAL.
OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT.
WAIT, HOLD ON,
DOCTOR.
GO AHEAD. NOW,
WHAT HAPPENED THEN?
WELL, THE NIGHT
THE COP GOT KILLED,
WILLIE AND I STAYED
AT MY PLACE.
THE NEXT MORNING I WENT TO
THE STORE TO GET SOME FOOD,
THEY ARRESTED ME.
WHEN WILLIE HEARD
I'D BEEN PICKED UP,
HE DISAPPEARED
LIKE A GHOST, MAN.
AND NEITHER YOU
NOR THE POLICE
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND
HIM SINCE, HAVE YOU?
NOPE.
BUT WE WILL.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME.
PSST!
PSST!
WILLIAMS, I GOT
A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.
THIS TRANSPLANT HAS
MADE MEDICAL HISTORY.

AND I'LL MAKE IT UP
TO YOU.
JUST YOU AND ME.
WE'LL TAKE ALL THE CREDIT
FOR WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE.
WHAT ABOUT
DR. DESMOND?
PHILIP? OH, HE'S
AN EXCELLENT SURGEON,
BUT I SEE A MORE PROMISING
FUTURE WITH YOU.
YOU ACTUALLY FEEL THAT
I COULD TAKE CREDIT
FOR SOMETHING WITH WHICH
I HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
THE REASON YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND, DOCTOR,
IS BECAUSE
YOU'RE A BIGOT.
A BIGOT OF
THE HIGHEST CALIBER.
AND BECAUSE OF THAT,
YOU HAVE UNDERESTIMATED
ME AND MY INTELLIGENCE.
MAYBE I SAID IT BADLY.
I APPRECIATE
YOUR INTELLIGENCE.
BUT WE'RE EXPANDING
THE OPERATIONAL FACILITIES,
WITH A MUCH LARGER
LAB CONTINGENCY,
AND I NEED A MAN LIKE YOU
TO HEAD THAT DEPARTMENT.
AND I NEED A MAN LIKE YOU
TO HEAD THAT DEPARTMENT.
AND IN ORDER TO WIN ALL THAT
GREAT ACCLAIM AND PRESTIGE,
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS HELP
YOU CUT OFF HIS HEAD.

[LAUGHS]
GOOD EVENING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS DICK WHITTINGTON.
AT THE TOP OF
THE NEWS TONIGHT
IS CERTAINLY ONE
OF THE MOST BIZARRE STORIES
THIS REPORTER
HAS EVER HEARD.
BUT IT HAS BEEN REPORTED
BY SEVERAL CONFIRMED
EYEWITNESSES
THAT A TWO-HEADED MONSTER
HAS BEEN SEEN.
POLICE HAVE ISSUED
AN ALL-POINTS BULLETIN.
POLICE AND STATE OFFICIALS
ARE ALSO INVESTIGATING THE
MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE
OF CONDEMNED MURDERER
JACK MOSS,
WHO LAST MONTH DONATED HIS
BODY TO MEDICAL SCIENCE.
HOW THIS SITUATION CAME
ABOUT IS STILL NOT KNOWN.
EARLIER AT HIS HOME THIS
MORNING, WE INTERVIEWED,
OR SHOULD I SAY,
WE ATTEMPTED TO INTERVIEW
DR. PHILIP DESMOND,
THE ACTING CHIEF OF THE
KIRSHNER TRANSPLANT FOUNDATION.
AND HERE IS THAT INTERVIEW.
DR. DESMOND, WHAT
KIND OF AN EXPERIMENT
WAS PERFORMED
ON JACK MOSS?
IT WAS NOT AN EXPERIMENT,
IT WAS AN OPERATION.
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT THE TWO-HEADED MAN?
NO FURTHER COMMENTS.
IT WAS A TRANSPLANT
OPERATION,
WASN'T IT, DOCTOR?
LOOK, GENTLEMEN, THE
FOUNDATION IN A FEW DAYS
WILL ISSUE A FORMAL
STATEMENT. NOW, EXCUSE ME.
LEVEL WITH US, DOCTOR.
HAVE YOU CREATED A MONSTER?
[CAR STARTS]
AW, COME ON, DOC,
GIVE US A BREAK.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO HIDE, ANYWAY?
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,
STILL NO ANSWERS.
BUT, THIS IS KNOWN--
A TWO-HEADED MAN
HAS BEEN SEEN,
AND IT IS SUSPECTED THAT
CONDEMNED MURDERER JACK MOSS
IS ONE OF THOSE TWO HEADS.
POLICE HAVE REPORTED THAT
THEIR SWITCHBOARDS ARE JAMMED
WITH CALLS FROM AN ALARMED
AND PANICKED PUBLIC.
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
AFTER THIS IMPORTANT
COMMERCIAL MESSAGE.
AFTER THIS IMPORTANT
COMMERCIAL MESSAGE.
YOU GET SOME SLEEP, BABY.
I'LL WAKE YOU
WHEN DINNER'S READY.
WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?
OH, COME ON, HONEY,
I GOT TO START DINNER.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO START NOW.
WHY DON'T YOU DO IT LATER?
COME ON, JACK, UH...
IS HE BOTHERING YOU?
I'LL COVER HIS HEAD
WITH A PILLOW CASE.
YOU MUST BE JOKING.
IS THAT ALL YOU PEOPLE
EVER THINK ABOUT?
IS THAT ALL YOU PEOPLE
EVER THINK ABOUT?
IT'S NO USE, HONEY.
MAYBE WHEN I GET
USED TO IT.
MAYBE WHEN I GET
USED TO IT.
NOW YOUKNOW
YOU GOT TO GO.
NOW YOUKNOW
YOU GOT TO GO.
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
TO JACK?
WHAT ABOUT
THAT OTHER HEAD?
I DON'T KNOW YET.
UM...
UM...
JACK TELLS ME THAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP HIM
LOCATE HIS WITNESS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HIS NAME IS
WILLIE THOMPSON.
WE TRACKED HIM DOWN ONCE
IN NASHVILLE, BUT...
HE TOOK OFF BEFORE
WE COULD TALK TO HIM.
Williams:
YOU SAY "WE."
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU HAVE A DETECTIVE
AGENCY ON IT?
Lila: MM-HMM.
THEN YOU REALLY BELIEVE
THAT HE'S INNOCENT.
WELL, IF I DIDN'T,
WOULD I SPEND
ALL THIS TIME AND MONEY?
I DON'T KNOW.
Lila: LOOK,
JACK WAS RAILROADED
BECAUSE THE COPS
DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER LEADS.
THE ONLY CRIME
JACK EVER COMMITTED
WAS LETTING WILLIE HIDE OUT
AT HIS PLACE.
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS,
THAT'S JACK'S STORY, TOO.
LISTEN, IT'S ALSO
WILLIE THOMPSON'S STORY.
I TALKED TO WILLIE
BEFORE HE TOOK OFF,
ONCE HE HEARD
THE COPS HAD PICKED UP JACK.
HE THOUGHT THE COPS
WERE GETTING TOO CLOSE,
SO HE SAID HE WAS SORRY
HE GOT JACK INTO TROUBLE
AND TOOK OFF.
AND WHEN I TOLD THEM THAT
IN COURT,
THEY SAID IT WAS HEARSAY.
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
SO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
JACK WANTS ME
TO HELP HIM.
WELL, ARE YOU?
WELL, ARE YOU?
WELL...
THE MORE I HEAR,
THE MORE I THINK I WILL.
THE MORE I HEAR,
THE MORE I THINK I WILL.
Lila: THAT'S GOOD.
BECAUSE HE CERTAINLY
DOESN'T DESERVE
WHAT HE'S GETTING.
WHAT HE'S GETTING.
COME ON.
YOU CAN HELP ME
CLEAN THESE GREENS.
CLEAN THESE GREENS.
ANYWAY...
ANYWAY...
I DIDN'T, UH,
I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY,
AND NOW I GOT
A SECOND CHANCE TO PROVE IT.
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET US
BOTH KILLED TRYING IT.
THAT'S GREAT LOGIC.
HERE, MAN,
HAVE SOME PORK CHOP--
OH, TAKE IT AWAY.
I CAN'T STAND THAT GARBAGE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BABY,
DON'T YOU DIG
SOUL FOOD?
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
FOR DESSERT, WATERMELON?
WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK
ABOUT HAVING
FRIED POSSUM
AND CHITTERLINGS
FOR SUPPER TOMORROW?
YES, SIR. HA!
ANYWAY, DOCTOR,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT EATIN',
'CAUSE I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THAT.
AFTER ALL,
IT'S MY STOMACH.
AND AFTER SUPPER,
WE CAN ALL SIT AROUND
AND SING SPIRITUALS.
COULD I HAVE A CIGARETTE?
OH, SURE, HONEY.
JACK.
LILA WAS TELLING ME
ABOUT WILLIE THOMPSON.
SAME THINK I TOLD YOU,
RIGHT?
RIGHT. SEEMS LIKE
THE COURT
DID GIVE YOU
A RAW DEAL.
DID GIVE YOU
A RAW DEAL.
HEY, MAN, DON'T BE
SMOKIN' WHILE I'M EATIN'.
DOC.
HOW DIFFICULT
WOULD IT BE
TO REMOVE
MR. PERSONALITY
FROM OFF OF
JACK'S BACK?
WITHOUT THE TEAM
OF SURGEONS
AND THE PROPER FACILITIES,
ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.
OH, COME ON, NOW,
DOCTOR.
WE BOTH KNOW
BETTER THAN THAT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN THAT
PLACING YOUR HEAD
ON JACK'S BODY MUST HAVE
BEEN QUITE A TASK,
BUT THE REMOVAL PROCESS
IS QUITE DIFFERENT,
ISN'T IT, DOC?
IN FACT,
ONE MIGHT CONSIDER IT
MERELY A BASIC
AMPUTATION.
YOU MEAN...
YOU MEAN YOU COULD
CUT HIM OFF OF JACK'S BACK
BY YOURSELF?
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
IF THERE'S SOMEPLACE
WHERE WE CAN FIND
THE RIGHT DRUGS AND...
SURGICAL EQUIPMENT...
WE COULD DO IT RIGHT HERE.
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME?
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME?
YES.
I THINK I WILL.
WILLIAMS,
IF YOU CUT OFF MY HEAD,
THAT'LL BE MURDER.
BUT IT'S OK FOR YOU
TO CUT OFF MY HEAD,
IS THAT RIGHT?
WILLIAMS,
I'M WARNING YOU--
LISTEN, KIRSHNER,
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH
TO CONVINCE ME
THAT THIS MAN
IS INNOCENT...
AND THAT YOU HAVE
NO RIGHT
TO HIS BODY.
THEN YOU'RE GONNA
HELP ME?
YES.
YES.
HONEY, CAN WE
BORROW YOUR CAR?
WHY, YOU IDIOT!
YOU DO THIS, YOU'LL BE
THE SAME AS HE IS--
A MURDERER!
BOYS, BOYS, BOYS,
DON'T ARGUE.
IT'S ALL SETTLED.
DR. MAX HAS GOT TO GO.
DR. MAX HAS GOT TO GO.
Jack: HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
Jack: HOLD IT. HOLD IT.
DO YOU THINK THERE ARE
ANY GUARDS IN HERE?
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW?
DID YOU BRING
YOUR GUN WITH YOU?
TSK. I LEFT IT
AT LILA'S.
ARE YOU SURE YOU'VE
EVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE?
NOT EVEN IN YOUR
APPRENTICESHIP?
NOT EVEN IN YOUR
APPRENTICESHIP?
LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS IT.
HEY!
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?
WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENIN'?
JACK.
HE'S TAKING CONTROL
OF YOUR BODY.

KIRSHNER HAS TAKEN CONTROL
OF THE BODY

IN THAT CASE,
WE'LL BE READY.
