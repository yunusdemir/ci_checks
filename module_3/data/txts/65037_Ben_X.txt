'Whitney Houston for Benny Boy.
We have a problem. "
For Benny Boy. The Marsman.
Every year you have a few.
Always alone in the school playground.
It is heartbreaking to see.
But yes, what do you then?
You can hold their hand hard.
And certainly no longer.
I wanted my son
To go to a normal school.
My wife, my ex-wife and I
had a quarrel.
But he was much smarter
than some of those other kids.
Three, five, ten times smarter.
An understandable question:
Where is God?
Where is this man
With its large, gray beard?
With all these wars and poverty
and injustice ... Where is God?
The interesting thing is that people who question
in the time of Jesus also questioned.
Because Jesus hung there 't cross
And she said:
'Jesus, why do you do nothing?
If your boss is creator of the universe.
If you can rise anyone from the dead?
Then this is child's play.
Click, clack and you are free. "
Jesus also suggests that question.
What's in the New Testament?
On the ninth hour Jesus cried
with loud voice:
"My God, my God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "
Jesus himself takes the time
Also that question.
He was humiliated and beaten.
They have destroyed him.
Jesus himself doubts God.
He can go in death.
Actually Jesus committed suicide.
So he rises.
Until the resurrection.
And that means that God ...
Goddammit, Bogaert!
Leave Ben alone!
I dont think this is the first time
I have daid that.
You get problems with me.
Ben is a bit different than you,
Than the deplorable average here.
And if your ask me, boft he says.
Apparently it's difficult to accept
that someone is a bit different.
Or do you want to tell us something,
Mr. Bogaert?
Something about a text that you last night
have been studied extensively?
Yes.
- I know something.
We are burning of curiosity,
Mr. Bogaert.
Does anyone know what Jesus said
When he was crusified?
'Hey, first my feet. "
That is very cute. 'My God,
Why have thou forsaken me? "
One question that I, believe me,
ask myself several times every day.
Hi quietly.
Calm, please.
Ben, do not opnaaien
By those guests. Stay just quiet.
That kind of lazy birds for the cat.
They have no chance.
They have forever a patch
stuck on his foot.
The fact that the director had said
That it had.
He has run around all day
with that patch.
He always had sandwiches with them.
But he has never been able to eat.
But yes, what can you do?
What we always do. Too little. Nothing.
That is our darling.
Hi, Benny Boy?
- Baby Jesus.
Leave him alone.
It will not be easy,
Eh, Benny Boy, why so different?
Quietly.
- Better than the average.
You are really our great example,
Eh, Ben? You are it.
<i> Quietly, quietly. </ I>
<i> Just stay quiet. </ I>
<i> Plain, ordinary, ordinary. </ I>
<i> Smiles </ i>.
<i> 'Like a laugh', they said. </ I>
Then <i> it would 't stop. </ I>
<i> Then they would have to stop. </ I>
Filming.
Action.
Queer.
Loser.
Dirty queer.
- Loser.
Look at me, boy.
If you 't tell me,
I can 't not recommended, Vertriest.
Look. My favorite customers.
The tenth time is free, eh.
- And why is that, do you think?
I do not know.
- You have really no idea?
Is it a quiz?
Do you find it funny, Desmet?
I honestly think this is not
at all funny.
You have apparently Vertriest ...
How will I 't say ... Bullied.
A little plagued. Not bullied.
- We do this together.
The difference is that a normal man
understands the joke, sir.
We still try to be normal
to him. We still talk with him.
But normally it is quite bad.
We are not those who throw chairs
throught the window, sir.
It is also not easy.
Let but, save that theatre
for the school.
And you ...
Now it's time to talk, my friend.
Say it. Say it.
Tell me what those two clowns
did wrong again.
But yes ...
With hindsight is easy talk, eh.
Well, easy ...
I mean ...
You feel like a former combatant
After a war that you have lost.
I almost no longer know how often I
have been in all these schools.
And always the same story.
At this school ...
We try pupils
to prepare for this hard world.
And they are.
And sometimes not.
About that glass you need . ..
The director said <i> </ i>
<i> That they be allowed </ i>.
<i> If I am still 's would be inspected. </ I>
Hopefully we can see each other more often.
- I hope so too.
And you let us know
What the doctor finally decided?
Or he further at this school ...
- Yes.
Come on, Ben, walk.
Ben, your camera. You have to look forward.
Really, look forward.
Ben, come.
Ben, this cant go on.
This cant go on no longer.

Hi, my son.

Is there something?
Do you want to tell me something?
- No.
You have one message.

Or is it not now?
I will let you ... Chat.

<i> What is my story? </ I>
<i> I was not normal, I was ... Special. </ I>
Thats what <i> everyone. </ I> said
Your child is just hypersensitive.
Just sensitive.
A few emotionally dysfunctional.
- A mild form of psychosis.
Just a little tense.
Like the mother?
I will give you this.
We can always do
further investigations.
<i> In-vestigate. Vestigate in what?</ I>
<i> And there is always a camera. </ I>
<i> They see it. </ I>
<i> Who's crazy and who's not. </ I>
It is a waste of time.
Pure waste of time.
You have to face it.
This cant go on no longer.
We need someone to help us.
- That child has nothing wrong.
Nothing, nothing.
I would not lose my mind.
- You will lose nothing but.
<i> You have to let go, they said. </ I>

Ben is not stupid.
On the contrary, he is very strong.
He is almost genious.

<i> The man who helped me far State. </ I>
He is strong in his senses.
We actually have to deal
with an extraordinary boy.
Those fights every day ...
As a normal boy
By the life.
And now the question:
Should we thereof help him?
Of those illusion that he as a habitual
Boy by the life could be.
I have heard that his schoolresults
is good. Very good indeed.
So why should we want
There now address?
Because he is bullied to death,
for example.
Yes well, that happens. That happens.
It would not, but could happen.
At a given moment
You get a stamp.
Autism.
Snap?
But that word ...
For me that was a child
Just that child.
For me it was Ben Ben.
Yes, these are volcanoes.
They are walking volcanoes
You do not know the strength.
Timebombs actually,
They live undercover in our world.
Because the reaction is often
much later than the cause.
We will continue.
Thats the best we can do.
We surely do not let us know.

And you prays that it may well just pass.
And that is usually the case.
But yes ...
This time, we certainly
skipped a prayer .
You know the outcome.
And we know it now.
I know only that the school

But I could.

And then they say: Yes, yes.
Yes, it's good. It is good.
Its going forward. Its going forward.

Really, it does.
But I am not crazy.

I am just a bit difficult.
Yes, difficult, which I am.
But I am used to train, mama.
Really, I am training.
I am broken. But I am reborn,

If you think that it goes quickly ...
That is really not the case.
Even if you have the good fortune
that you are immediately beheaded ...
Then it still that your head have

You can imagine that youre

You just before you die ...
The movie of your life

And? Did it?
But who has ...

I of course. Who else?
Sufferd.
You?
And he has no notable scars
Or a birthmark or something?
Scars?
That was already destroyed sure?
And did you notice something odd out?
I dont get it, Ben.
Really.

'On the road. No worries. '
Well, it is surely good news?
That is to say that he is just a road
And you do not have to be worried.
My son does not do that,
Just go away on Saturday morning.
Hes not even allowed to leave.
And indeed, look,
I have found this.
It is a perfect day to throw back your head
and kiss it all goodbye
101 ways
to kill yourself
I do not know if you know, Ben ...
In real life ...
Dying is quite final.
You can not imagine.
You may be dying.
But not in real life.
So we should not play, Ben.
You, level 80.
Do you want away from this world, Ben?
Now go away.
But if you want to take revenge, Ben,
Wreek you then.
Because otherwise you just
What they can say. A loser.
Play to win, Ben.
Everything is planning.
Everything is strategy.
Keep your true of Fanta?
I am so happy.
That you you are you.
Well, we shall him nationwide
As missing.
And this?
What are you going to do?
I will contact
With social workers.
They know that only too well.
Too bad.
"I wanted the only way," he said.
'But I dared not as good death
Because I did not know what that was. "
Was that your big plan?
How do we do it?
Are we poison?
No. Imagine that youve taken your
poison and and it in your body.
Then you call 911, poison department.
"Hello?"  "Baaaarf!"
The people there
always get that kind of calls.
That is really something for stomkoppen.
You can also hang yourself.
That is really tough. Then your appearance
is like to obtain an enormous erection.
But you yourself has shitted yourself.
That's not so cool
to be found this way, eh.
You know, Ben, furthermore ...
What they found under the fingernails
someone who has hung?
All small bits of rope and sheet.
And do you know why that is?
That's because they desperately try
to get that rope of their neck
And that succeeds or not. Because the seat
Is too far and they can not.
Ben, you find it exciting, eh?
Dying.
Dying.
Everything is in one time.
Ben is in one time.
Would you do not have to look one time
See if there is a different solution?
Not even one time around.
You should damn it
be a little more creative, Ben.
Obligation and beauty.
You are so beautiful.

'You must help me,' he said.
And we have helped him.
We knew that everybody would say:
There is nothing you can do.
But that is more or less
what i have done.
You may not smoke, Sabrina.
- It is' Sabine '.
You should be thankful
That you should not smoke.
Yes, I am incredibly grateful.
Another half-day to live longer.
That does not really believe you.
That does not really go?
You see it yourself that this is not possible.
I cannot.
Sabine, you have absolutely nothing.
You wanted the necessarily account.
I made no difference.
But if you think that its us
Easy, you have it wrong.
Watch.
The sea.
The end of the world.
And you know what they say, eh Ben?
Each end is a beginning.
Does someone want something to eat? Ben?
Sabine?
- No, please do not.
Dont you feel good, Sabine?
- Not really, no.
Ben, are you sure?
Is this what you want?
Good.

Dear attendees.
Dear family ...
Ladies and gentlemen ...
Ladies and gentlemen,
Girls and boys.
We are meeting here this afternoon
To say farewell to ...
Of a very special young man.
Who we miss
And very tragically ...
..has died.
Ben has never been easy.
With the condition that he had -
It has made his life difficult.
Perhaps we realize now,
Too late then ...
that he struggled with this disability,
We will say.
And that this was worse
than we can think.
Because there is never
a real contact.
And now even more will be.
We can today only
Accept ...
That some things simply
too heavy to bear.
Therefore family ...
Hello.
Thank you for coming.
I also died,
As they say.
dead to myself.
Best to-people and fellows ...
My fight has stopped.
At the end of your life you see the movie
of your life as well, they say.
Here are a few scenes
Which you may find interesting.
Ben, come on. Now. <i> The endgame </ i>.
<i> Creative death, they called it. </ I>
Suicide <i> without the murder. </ I>
Dying without <i> a way to go </ i>
<i> Or leave without death. </ I>
<i> I have everything to learn. </ I>
But the main <i> </ i>
<i> I was forgotten. </ I>
<i> Learning lie </ i>.
<i> Faking </ i>.
There was a death first.
Otherwise you were probably not show up.
For a boy
Simply bullied.
And at a certain point, you can not
Continue to cry out and ask ...
Mama, as evil.
And even 's questions whether now please
Anything can happen.
That finally would stop.
That they would finally stop
bullying my son.
And his life as ...
Sorry, but it was really true.
His life as impossible.
His autism is his problem,
But for him it's no problem.
They are the others.
That is the problem. Others.
They have to learn my small
Alone casting.
Ben simply wanted to go.
Now he's gone.
And fortunately he was still alive.
He lives.
In his own world, perhaps,
But he still lives. He still lives.
His life.
Let it happen, Ben.
Do not be afraid.
If you want to feel good,
You have to learn to feel good.
Caress him.

<i> But I have never been so</ i>
<i> Happy. </ I>
Nice, eh.
Animals do not have to talk.
Are you not allowed to mount?
Held on socks.
There is always something ... People see
A horse and want out.
But these animals have
There is not asked?
Do you not?
Because if you can choose to only ...
Oh yes ...
