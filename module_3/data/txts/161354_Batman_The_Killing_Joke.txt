Why can't you see the funny side?
Why aren't you laughing?
<b><font color="#D900D9">(GRUNTING)</font></b>
Because I've heard it before,
and it wasn't funny the first time.

I spoke with Commissioner Gordon
before I came in here.
He told me he wanted
this done by the book.
You know what that means?
It means that despite all your sick,
cruel, vicious little games,
he's as sane as he ever was.
So, ordinary people don't crack.
Maybe it's just you.
- No!

God damn it.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Kick the hell out of me
and get your standing ovation.
Come on!
No, not this time.
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't want either of us
to end up killing the other.
But we're running out of alternatives.
Perhaps it all hinges on tonight.
I don't know what it was
that bent your life out of shape,
but maybe I've been there, too.
Maybe we could work together.
I could rehabilitate you.
You don't need to be alone.
We don't have to kill each other.
Let me help you.
I'm sorry, but no.
No, it's far too late for that.

You know, it's funny.
This reminds me of a joke.
See, there were two guys
locked in a lunatic asylum
and one night, one night they decided
they didn't like that anymore.
They decided to escape.
So, they made it up to the roof and there,
just across this narrow gap,
they see rooftops,
stretching across town,
stretching to freedom.
Now, the first guy,
he jumps right across, no problem.
But his friend, <b><font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font></b> no way,
he's afraid of falling.
So, the first guy, he has an idea.
He says,
"Hey, I got this flashlight with me.
"I'll shine it across the gap
between the buildings
"and you can walk across
the beam and join me."
But the second guy says,
"What do you think I am, crazy?
"You'll just turn it off
when I'm halfway across."

Hmm.

Yeah, Dad, I just got back
from the lacrosse game.
Going to practice
some Wallball this weekend.
Getting pretty good.
Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.
I can't help it
if your daughter's so popular.
I'll talk to you, later.
