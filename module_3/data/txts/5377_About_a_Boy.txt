Yeah, and then he was like,
"I will look for you.
"I will find you.
And I will 'kall' you."
That is such a good
Liam Neeson.
Thank you.
If he were
a drunk leprechaun.
Hey!
You could not do
better than that.
I will look for you.
Oh. Oh.
I will find you.
And I will kill you!
Oh!
Oh, hi, Fiona.
I'm so sorry.
We just saw this movie
where Liam Neeson, like,
kills an entire country
with his bare hands.
Don't even bother explaining.
She doesn't like anything
that's fun and violent.
Hey, we got a single malt
calling our name in there,
so let's go.
Hey, no, I live alone.
I know what's it like to have to
take out the trash by yourself at night.
Well, this is actually compost
going in the worm hole, Liz.
But thank you.
Point applies.
Nice to have an empathetic
person around, Will, a human.
You know what has made me
feel safer?
Krav Maga.
Yeah, it's Israeli
self-defense training.
It's very empowering.
Do you know, my friend Moishe
on the kibbutz,
he was always trying to get me
to try Krav Maga,
but I was always too busy
making the babka.
You know, you could
come with me.
Yeah. That'll be fun.
I'll text you.
Will has your deets, right?
Yeah, totally.
I got her deets.
And I'll get those to you.
You go get comfy.
I'll go get those to you
right away, all right?
Get cozy.
Back off, babka.
What?
I like that girl very much,
and any time you get
near someone that I like,
bad things happen.
But I happen to like her,
and despite her very
questionable taste in men,
I'm going to hang out
with her.
She's nice. So I'll give her
my deets myself.
Fine, but if you
figure out a way,
with your weird compost voodoo,
to ruin what I have going
with that adorable girl
in there,
I will look for ye.
I will find ye.
And I will kill ye.
God, you sound like
the Lucky Charms fellow.
That was perfect Liam Neeson.
You know it!

What is this chaos
on the screen, buddy?
My last text exchange
with Shea.
I sent her
heart, heart, flame,
winky face, winky face,
sumo wrestler, obviously,
heart.
Right, okay.
And she sent me...
Skull.
Oh, that's what that is.
The point is, our emoji trade
deficit is at record levels here.
Okay, that's not a thing.
Sure, it is.
That initial frisson
we first felt
when we came together,
it's fading, Will.
Here's the deal:
You just need to take Shea
on a great date, okay?
The best date I ever went on,
when Sam and I just really
started to connect,
we walked by this fountain,
and we ended up liberating
these pedal boats.
Pedal boats!
Is there no end
to your genius?
No end.
It's the perfect plan.
I'm going to pedal up
the romance with Shea,
and you're coming along
to help.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
chaperoning and romance
do not go hand-in-hand,
my friend.
Well, neither do romance
and drowning.
I need you there, Will.
I swim like a stone.
- I'm already texting Shea.
- Oh, boy.
Okay, just be honest
- with me here.
- Mm-Hmm.
Is 16 winky faces too much?
- Yes.
- You're right.
- 17 it is.
- Okay.
- Hey.
- Hi.
So I have a favor...
- Ooh!
- To ask you,
and it's annoying and lame,
and I'm really sorry.
Wow, annoying<i> and</i> lame.
Are you trying
to drive me wild with desire?
Can you pick Clay up
after practice
and just, like, hang out with him
for a couple of hours?
Oh, uh, I would absolutely
love to.
I'm chaperoning Marcus
on a date.
It's so important to him.
It's gonna be funny.
Here you go.
Okay, I don't want to be
that girlfriend, but...
Earlier, you got
a little weird
when Fiona and I were talking
about hanging out.
And now you're picking
her kid's thing
over my kid's thing.
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
Well, I mean,
you have to admit
you guys do have kind of a--
It's a strange relationship.
No, she's strange.
I'll give you that.
No, but she and I
are totally normal.
Hey, can you do me up?
Oh, my God,
did Kofi annan come out
with a women's line of clothing?
Zip it, J.Crew.
Literally.
Hello, Liz!
Looking forward
to our Krav Maga sesh.
Have you seen my moccasins?
Pointy toe or round toe?
Pointy.
Oh, they're hideous.
Yeah, they're under
your couch.
You liked them before.
What time would you like me
to pick Clay up?
- 2:30.
- That's perfect for me.
All right, how is having
your girlfriend's son on my date
a good thing?
Listen, I can't be
a third wheel, all right?
You need a fourth wheel
to balance the vehicle.
Balance the vehicle?
Is that a thing?
No, not really,
but just trust me.
Don't worry. You won't
even know he's here.
Ahoy!
Me and my lady seek
your fittest plastic vessel.
This one should suffice.
Be she polished
and seaworthy?
She be 10 bucks, no refunds.
Wait, life vests optional?
Who wouldn't take an option
that could save your life?
Actually, I'm--I'm good.
Yeah, it's, like,
2 feet deep out here,
all right, Marvin?
I think you're gonna be okay.
All right, first,
it's Marcus.
And second of all,
you obviously haven't read
the same safety blogs
my mom and I do.
All right guys, listen up.
There ain't no shame
in the safety game, all right?
Dude wants a vest,
he's going to get a vest.
You look like
a woman's small.
Those are out back.
I will return
in the blink of an eye.
So what are you listening to?
He can't hear
a word you're saying.
Don't even bother
asking questions.
Just stare out at the water.
Actually, it's these guys,
4Cain.
No one really knows them,
though.
Really?
Wait, when'd you get that?
Oh, today with a Sharpie,
but if I can save up enough,
then I'm gonna get it
for real.
Oh, you should go to my guy.
He's the best.
Hey, just put your shirt down.
What's wrong with you?
Marcus is about to come back--
Are you two lovebirds
going in or not?
They're not lovebirds.
They just met.
They're not together.
Actually, we have a class
together-- world civ.
- She never shows up, so I--
- Hey, hey, hey.
He's not writing
a book about you.
I don't care what you are.
You're holding up my line.
Oh, sir, no.
Wait, hold on.
Marcus, Marcus!
Right, who's ready
for a sensible balance
of fun and safety...
Where's my lady going?
All right, you got to look
on the bright side, buddy.
You and I get
to go boating together.
You don't get seasick,
do you?
All right, if Liam Neeson can jump
out of a helicopter into a powerboat,
we should be able to get you
into that thing
if you could just help me out
with a little more pedaling.
Ugh. All right,
one question.
Why is the sky
so cloudy and dark?
I thought the weather
was clear today.
What are--
- Whoa.
- What?
You are having
a major allergic reaction.
Your meds are back in my car.
It can't be.
I haven't eaten anyhthing since
my gluten-free cereal this morning,
and it's not pollen season yet.
Unless...
Oh, latex.
The devil's fabric!
- Get it off me, Will!
- Whoa! Don't rock the boat!
Get it off
before it's too late!
Ah!
Whoo!
Okay, your turn.
Go ahead.
Just give him a swift kick
to the throat.
Trust me;
This feels amazing.
- You got this.
- Okay, okay.
Beep.
Oh.
I'm not very good at it.
You know what helps me?
If I think of someone
I really despise.
If I tell you who I picture,
do you promise not to judge me?
Oh, yeah.
No, go on. Tell me.
Okay.
It's the mean moms
at school...
Gossiping about
which mom brought
the pepperoni pizza
to the bake sale.
Well, you know what?
That was me,
because I work for a living,
Kaitlin!
I salute you,
fellow warrior mother.
Oh.
Ah, okay.
- Got to work on my fiving.
- Yeah. Let's try that.
I can't believe Will thought
something bad would come
from us hanging out together.
Well, he clearly
knows nothing.
Well, I've been saying that
for a long time,
although he never listens,
obviously.
He's so arrogant and rude
and impossibly vain.
And he never, ever, no matter
how many times I tell him,
recycles!
Anybody else?
All right, buddy, you're
still in the game here, all right?
You just need to perk up
a little bit.
Get your lady
a soft-serve ice cream,
and take her on a little stroll
around the park.
You know, Will,
I'm beginning to think
you may have given me
the wrong allergy medicine.
No, no, no,
double dose of blue,
just like
your mom's song says.
♪ Get them wrong,
and you will... ♪
Oh! Frown.
Marcus, are you okay?
Oh, no.
No, he's fine.
Yeah, he's--
He looks awful, dude.
He needs a nap.
No, he's just
a little tuckered out
for all the partying
he did last night.
But he told me
he spent last night
learning this new
knitting stitch
called the cable and twist.
Oh, that's not
a knitting stitch.
That's a dance move
from Japan.
It's on YouTube.
I'm surprised
you guys haven't seen it.
You know, the arm thing?
It's like a...
One of those things,
and then--
Marcus!
Yeah, he's fine.
He's fine.
That's the end part
of the dance move,
where you do the kneel.
He was just getting into it.
All right, guys, let's go
get some soft-serve.
Right over there.
They got the good stuff.
Here we go.
Uh, bud, what flavor
are you gonna get?
Blueberry?
Yeah, I like blueberry too.
I'm gonna get chocolate
this time.
Give me that.
You suck.
I do not.
You suck.
No, you suck.
No, you suck.
Hey, hey, hey, guess what.
You both suck, okay?
Time to go, Shea.
Hey, um...
You know, we should
hang out again.
I'll call you.
What was that?
Did you just ask her out?
'Cause she is spoken for
by this awesome little dude
right here.
You know what, Will?
I'm gonna walk home
from here.
Clay, I'm not done with you.
You--hey, don't put
your foot on--
hey, Clay?
Yeah, you keep walking.
Chin up, dude.
Literally, man.
Let's get that thing closed.
I have to say,
you could not be cooler,
especially considering
what's going on
with our kids right now.
What is going on?
Will didn't tell you?
- No.
- Ugh.
Well, apparently,
my son, Clay,
tried to steal
Marcus's girlfriend.
He is such a little monster.
- Did he?
- Yeah.
You know, I bet
Will didn't tell you
because he was afraid
you would, like,
freak out or something.
Why do guys always do that?
It's like just because
we're moms,
we can't be
calm, rational people?
That's ridiculous.
I mean, I do feel really bad,
but what are you gonna do?
Kids will be kids, right?
Unless you want to be
one of those insane
helicopter moms
who is afraid to let her child
feel a moment's disappointment.
- Yeah, God forbid that, though.
- Mm-Hmm.
That would be crazy,
wouldn't it?
I mean, and we're
not crazy, are we?
Are we?
Coffee, please.
Thank you.
Oh, hey, Shea.
Hey, I have homework to do,
so I'm not really
in the mood to talk.
Oh, me neither.
I hate talking.
No... I'm just here
for the coffee.
I love it here.
Really?
Coffee's terrible here.
All right, fine, look.
Shea, I'm here to stop you
from making a huge mistake.
You don't know
what you're talking about.
Shea, let me just--
just answer me
one question, okay?
What does this--what does
this Clay kid have
that Marcus doesn't?
I--I don't know.
It's just, he's into
all the same stuff that I am.
And...
Marcus is--he's just
still such a kid.
Yeah, I mean, I hear you.
I hear you.
You know, he may be
on the sheltered side.
You know, and he may still
occasionally nap with a blankie.
He naps with a blankie?
Scratch that.
I never said that, okay?
Look, there are so many
cooler guys in the world
than Marcus, all right?
But, Shea, there is no one
with a bigger, sweeter heart
and a goofier, braver spirit
than Marcus.
And I will take that
over that polished act
Clay's got any day.
Um, excuse me.
Oi!
Those precious to you,
are they?
Uh, yeah.
Well, I'd like you to imagine
what it would feel like
to have something
that you cared about deeply
ripped out of your hands,
'cause then you'll understand
how my son feels.
Okay, look, Mrs...
Will's neighbor.
Um, I didn't rip
anyone away, okay?
I'm not sure you get
how liking someone works.
Oh, you're not sure
I get that.
Mm-Hmm. Well.
I would just like you
to consider
the karmic implications
of your actions,
because did you know
the Buddha teaches
that for every selfish act,
a seed of pain is planted
inside your consciousness
that will one day blossom
into a great big tree
of suffering?
Uh, yeah, my tree's good.
Really?
...You're not having those...
Those are mine.
Give those back.
Promise me that you won't
steal Shea. Promise!
You're crazy.
I have not begun
to bring the crazy.
Basketball's not
your sport, is it?
Ladies.
Hey, we have a situation.
Oh, yeah, we have
a situation.
You allowed
your girlfriend's son
to ruin Marcus's date
and probably his life.
Okay, the important thing is,
I am doing something
about it, all right?
Well, I'm doing something
about it.
I've done something about it.
Bloody hell.
Listen, stay right there.
I am not done with you.
Hi.
What were you thinking,
accosting my kid
at school today?
I didn't accost him.
We were having
a conversation.
- Well, because he told me...
- Oh, come in.
...that you stole his headphones
and then you threatened
to "bring the crazy"?
Yeah, well, that's just
cockney rhyming slang
for... something.
- What?  - Well, nothing that
you'd understand, actually.
And you know what?
I did accost him.
I did.
But he started it.
Wow, I cannot believe
I thought you were cool.
I am cool.
Hey, guys,
what are you talking about?
And of course you're here,
at your neighbor's house,
mm-hmm.
Are you aware that she basically
mugged my child today?
What?
I did not mug your child.
I confiscated his headphones,
and he deserved it.
Remember when I was telling you
how whenever you get near
someone I like--
what was it, good things happen
or bad things happen?
I forget.
I was just protecting my son.
Yeah, by butting into something
that had nothing to do with you.
- What?  - Kids need to make
their own mistakes, you know.
That's the only way
they learn anything.
Two women,
two parenting styles.
I think we should agree
to disagree and go get some cookies.
that is the most facile,
tiger motherish thing to say.
You know why your son
doesn't need protecting?
- Why?
- 'Cause he's the bully.
Oh, that's interesting,
coming from a woman
who threatens a child
half her size.
Oh, oh, oh!
We're going to do
the tall girl jokes now,
are we?
Well, hey,
if the gigantic shoe fits...
Get ready!
Oh, you watch yourself.
I am a Krav Maga level seven.
Well, I am a mama bear
level eight.
Ladies, ladies, ladies!
As much as I would like
to watch you guys go at it
and tear
each other's clothes off,
just get in there, ah,
I need you to relax
and chill!
- Ooh!
- Oh, my gosh, are you okay?
Yeah, I was trying to tell you
that I talked to Shea
and I think I really may have
gotten through to her.
Well, do you think she'll change
her mind about dumping him?
I do.
Ugh, this is the strangest
relationship ever.
Will, Mom!
Clay's mom.
I don't know what happened
while I was unconscious,
but it must have been
pretty good,
because I just got
a text from Shea
saying,
"We need to talk."
I owe it all to you, Will.
That's what
"we need to talk" means?
Are you sure?
So sorry, buddy.
Look, you know,
all I can say is,
I've been in your shoes,
and it's just--
You've had the girl
you're crazy about
leave you for somebody else?
N-no, not exactly.
But, you know, there have been
things that I've wanted
- that I haven't gotten--
- She's not some new iPhone
there's a waiting list for.
She's my heart and my soul
and...
She's here.
"She walks in beauty,
like the night
"of cloudless climes
and starry skies.
"And all that's best
of dark and bright
meet in her aspect
and her eyes."
That was so beautiful, man.
Is that John Mayer?
Lord Byron,
you handsome dummy.
Well, I guess this is it.
Got to go have the talk
with her.
Listen.
If you need help,
I'll go down there with you.
No.
I need to do this one on my own.
Hey, you--you said
you wanted to talk?
FYI, I just found out
what that means.
Yeah, uh...
God, this is so hard.
Have you--have you read
the <i>Fire Be With Me</i> books?
I have not.
Well, um,
there's this sorceress,
Meeha,
and she--she has
this awful decision to make.
She has to choose between Kade,
the man-wolf,
and Soren,
the wind whisperer.
Yeah, I'm just gonna take
a wild guess
that in this analogy,
I am not the man-wolf.
And the thing is,
she really likes
the both of them,
just in different ways.
And she goes back and forth
for, like, hundreds of years.
That's--that's kind of
how I feel.
I like you.
I really do.
But I--I also like
somebody else,
and it's really confusing.
Does that make sense?
Not really.
I mean, you're my favorite.
I'd never go back and forth
about you.
Marcus, that's what makes this
really hard.
You're just so sweet.
I get it.
You don't feel
the same way that I do,
and you feel too bad
about hurting me
to come out and say it,
so I've got to say it for you.
Good-bye, Shea.
It was brief,
but it was beautiful.
Thanks for letting me
get to know you.
You turned out even greater
than I thought you would.
And I thought you'd be
pretty great.
Oh, darling, I do know
exactly how you feel.
It's like you're in
a tidal wave of heartbreak
that is threatening
to sweep you
into an ocean of grief.
I--I think what your mom
is trying to say is,
you know, you kept
your dignity, man,
and we're just so proud
of you for that.
What good is my dignity?
Can my dignity hold my hand
on my way to school?
No!
Can my dignity kiss me
four times?
No, darling.
You only kissed her
four times?
Would you shut up?
I'm sorry, but he--
he was going out with her
for, like, months.
I may have missed her lips
a couple times,
caught some earlobe instead.
Well, that's still face,
man, so that counts.
You know, Will,
the only beacon of light
shining in the black sea of
despair that is my heart
is knowing that I'm not
the only one who'll be alone.
That's right.
That's a really good way
of looking at it.
Your mom is all alone too.
Yeah, thank you
for bringing that up
right now, Will.
No, I meant you, Will.
As my best friend,
there's no way
you could continue going out
with the mother
of my sworn enemy.
Darling, little bear,
it's all right;
Mummy's here.
I'm gonna go
warm up this tea here.
Nobody wants to stay
at the Heartbreak Hotel,
- darling. -
_
You don't ever need
a girlfriend, darling.
You've got mummy.
You don't need a girl.
