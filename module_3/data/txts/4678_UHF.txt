Señor...
we must not
go any further.
Look!
It is an ancient,
sacred Hovitos symboI.
It's certain death
for anyone who enters.
We must turn back...
now!
Ahh!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Bob: George.
Hello?
Earth to George.
- George!
- Ahh!
Are you
daydreaming again?
No, no, I was just admiring
how clean and shiny this grill is.
Come on, George.
We're busy here.
You know what
the problem is?
Nobody here appreciates
a guy with a good imagination.
Well, at least not the
people at the lumber yard
or the miniature golf course
or Floyd's Fish Market,
or any of the other places you worked
in the last month, right?
Yeah. Well, someday...
someday they'll be sorry.
They'll be eating
breakfast or something
and all of a sudden,
they'll say,
"Hey!
We screwed up!
We never should have
fired George Newman
because he's got
imagination. "
Well, I think the fries
are just about done.
Aw, jeez, you better not
let Big Edna see that.
- She'll have a fit.
- Big Edna, Big Edna.
You sound like
a broken record.
Why are you so afraid
of that pathetic tub of lard?
Both: Whoa!
Ahh!
Bob: How could you
do this to me?
I knew this was
gonna happen.
You're right, Bob.
I'm sorry.
What can I say?
I'm a miserable,
worthless hunk of slime.
Here.
I want you to take
this crowbar and...
just bash my
head right in!
Go ahead, really. Please.
Just bash it right in!
Ah, George, you know
I couldn't do that.
You still owe
me five bucks.
Man: Wah-hoo!
Ahh!
Hey, Kuni.
Hiya, George.
Beginner's class
today, huh?
Yeah.
They're so stupid!
Oh!
Stupid!
Mm, boy!
Look what I got
here, Bob.
A twinkie-wiener
sandwich!
Your favorite.
Come on, Bob.
Cheer up, will you?
You ruined my life.
You know, Bob-o,
I think you're developing
a bad attitude here.
You see, Bob...
...you gotta look
at the big picture.
You gotta grab
life by the lips
and yank as
hard as you can!
See anything
in the want ads?
Yeah. But nothing with the prestige
of working at Burger World.
So what do you think
Teri's gonna say
when she
hears you got fired again?
Teri? Oh, no.
What time is it?
7:30? Oh boy, I gotta go.
I'll see you later, Bob.
Kuni: Stupid!
So, what's your
excuse this time?
Well, Bob and I were having
a serious discussion
about our various career options.
Boy, I really like
what you've done with your hair.
- It's really...
- George, did you get fired again?
Yes! Yes!
It's all true!
I just don't know
what's wrong with me!
So, what's for dinner?
Mashed potatoes?
My favorite!
Teri, you
shouldn't have.
George!
When are you gonna start taking things
a little more seriously?
I mean, you've been
wandering aimlessly
from job to job ever
since I've known you.
If you could just get
that overactive imagination of yours
to work for you
instead of against you,
maybe you could...
What are you doing?
This means something.
This is important.
Oh, George,
that is just terrible.
But don't you worry,
you're a fine young man.
I'm sure you'll get
anotherjob right away.
You got such
a good face.
Look at this face.
Would you look
at this face?
Is this a face
you could die for?
So, where's Uncle Harvey?
I haven't seen him all night.
Oh, he'll be out soon.
I think he's having some sort of
last-minute business meeting.
Two pair,
aces high.
Yeah, what?
Hey, Louie.
I just wanted to congratulate you,
Mr. Bilchik.
You did very well
at the track this afternoon.
Oh, yeah?
I won again, huh?
Right. Yeah.
Thanks, Louie. Bye.
Now, what are we
doing here?
Man:
it's your deaI, Harvey.
Oh, hi, honey.
Have you finished
your meeting?
Oh, yeah, yeah,
and business
was great tonight.
Harvey, have you
been gambling again?
Hey! What are you
complaining about?
This is for when you go
shopping on Rodeo Drive.
What's this?
Oh, that's the deed
to ChanneI 62.
I won it with a pair of sevens.
I was bluffing.
ChanneI 62?
- Never heard of it.
- I'm not surprised.
More people watch
the fish tank at Leo's pet store.
It's a little UHF station
on the edge of town.
It's been on the brink
of bankruptcy for years.
- It's too bad I gotta dump it.
- Oh, really?
I kind of like the idea of us
having our own TV station.
Forget about it.
They can't even find anybody
to manage the place anymore.
Harvey, I know somebody
who'd be perfect for the job.
Oh, yeah?
Who's that?
George! George, dear,
can you come over here for a second?
Oh, no.
No, not him.
Forget it. No way.
Teri: I can't believe
your Uncle Harvey's
letting you run
his TV station.
George:
Hey, he trusts me.
Besides, he's going
to California.
He doesn't want
to be bothered with it.
Well, here we are.
This is it?
Wow, this is even
better than I imagined!
Come on.
Let's go check it out.
I don't know,
George.
I'm not so sure
about this.
See?
The front door's open.
It's a friendly place.
Man:
Hey, mister!
Change?
You got change?
Oh, um... sure.
85...
95...
one dollar!
Thanks, mister.
Voice on TV:
Hello. I'm Mr. Ed.
Can I help you?
Who are you?
I'm Philo.
Chief engineer.
So...
isn't it a little late
for you to be working?
I mean, what time do
you normally go home?
This is my home.
I live here.
Hold these.
No, no,
like this.
George:
What are you doing?
Oh, I just want to see
if my interociter
can withstand a sudden charge
of 60,000 volts.
What?
Ahh!
Yeah...
it works.
I don't know about this, George.
I mean, I don't know the first thing
about what goes on
at a television station.
Don't worry, Bob.
It's just like working in a fish market,
except you don't have to
clean and gut fish all day.
Yeah, so?
Can I help you?
Hi. I'm George Newman.
I'm the new
station manager.
You know, when I first
took this job,
they told me that
this position was only temporary
and that eventually,
when the time was right,
I would be moved up to news,
which is really my forte.
You know how long
I've been working here?
Two years!
It's kind of hard
to get promoted
when every other week
you have a new boss!
This job really sucks.
And this is my
friend Bob.
Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Howdy, friends.
It's Crazy Ernie
from Crazy Ernie's
Used Car Emporium.
It's a giant
supermarket of cars!
I got so many cars
people come up to me and say,
"Hey, Crazy Ernie,
where'd you get all those cars?"
Lookie here!
I got red cars, I got green cars!
I got enough cars
to choke a cameI!
Tell you what, friends,
if nobody comes down and buys
a car from me in the next hour,
I'm gonna club
this baby seaI!
That's right! I'm gonna club a seaI
to make a better deaI!
You know I'll do it, too,
'cause I'm crazy!
Ha ha ha!
Look at all the old reruns
this station is airing.
We could sure use
some more live shows.
I don't know,
something like, uh...
Pam: Oh, no!
You okay in there, Pam?
Yes. It's just if it's not
one thing, it's another.
You know, that mailman's
really got a screw loose.
He delivers us this package.
It's supposed to go to R.J. Fletcher.
Who?
R.J. Fletcher.
He runs ChanneI 8,
you know, the network
affiliate downtown?
Oh, well, I guess I'll just have to
send it back to him tomorrow.
No. That's okay.
I- I'll take it over myself.
It'll be a good chance
to meet the competition.
You know, George,
I'll tell you,
I don't really think
that's such a good idea.
I heard he's not
the nicest guy in the world.
Oh, come on.
He can't be all that bad.
You just gotta know
how to talk to those guys.
Fletcher: You idiot! Can't you
do anything I tell you to do?
Does this look like
a No. 2 penciI?
- No. I just thought...
- You thought?
I don't pay
you to think!
- But, Dad...
- Shut up!
Let's get back to the meeting.
All right, who's got
the research report?
I left the report
on your desk, sir.
I don't see it.
When did you put it here?
Yesterday
before I left, sir.
The janitor.
It must have been the janitor.
He probably threw it out
when he was cleaning up in here.
Send in the janitor.
I'm gonna get to
the bottom of this.
I will not tolerate
this kind of behavior at ChanneI 8.
This is a business,
not a home
for irresponsible
pus-brains!
Uh... you wanted
to see me, sir?
That's right.
I guess you know
why I called you in here.
Uh... because you're lonely?
No, you moron.
Oh, duh.
Now, look carefully.
Do you see anything
missing from this desk?
Uh...
That stapler?
No!
Now listen to me. There was
a very important file on this desk,
a file that represented two months
of intensive research.
It's my guess that
you threw it out.
Oh, uh, no, sir.
No, uh...
Were you in here
cleaning up last night?
Uh, yes, sir...
yes, sir, I was.
Do you see that file
on my desk now?
Gee, I don't know.
I think I've
proven my point.
You are a worthless
human being Mr., uh...
Spadowski.
Stanley Spadowski.
May I call
you Stanley?
Okay.
Stanley, you're fired!
But I... I didn't...
Get out!
But I...
People are...
I can't believe the incompetence
in this place.
People like that
should be put to sleep.
Whew.
Well, what do you know?
The research file.
Here it is.
Been sitting here all the time.
Betty,
hold my calls.
Yes,
Mr. Fletcher.
Hey, R.J.!
Hi!
George Newman, U-62.
Say,
nice place you got here.
You know, I was just thinking,
since we're both in the business...
Where'd you get this?
Do you realize that stealing maiI
is a federaI offense?
Hold on.
You don't understand...
No, you don't understand
how serious a crime this is.
I think you'd just better
clear out your desk and get out.
You're through, mister.
But, I don't work here.
Trespassing, huh?
You've got 10 seconds to get out
before I call the police.
Look, I thought
we could...
Five...
four...
- three...
- Gee, look at the time.
Well, gotta go.
Keep in touch.
No. No. Please.
It's all I've got left!
Let go.
This is station property.
No! No!
It's my mop!
Let go!
Let go, you idiot!
That's my mop!
Not any more, buddy!
Hey, are you
all right?
It's just not fair.
Come on, forget about it.
It's only a mop.
"Only a mop"?
"Only a mop"?
Oh, you don't
understand.
That mop was given to me
for my birthday when I was 8 years old.
We've never
been apart!
Now...
now I don't even
have a job anymore.
After 15 years,
they just toss me out
like an old bag
of moldy tangerines.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?
Well...
...maybe you could
come work for me.
Really?
You mean it?
Sure. I guess we
could use a janitor.
- Stanley Spadowski.
- George Newman.
I'm mighty glad
to meet you, George.
I'm gonna do a really good job.
You won't be sorry.
I'm really gonna do a good job
for you, George. I'm a good janitor.
You want me to clean
your glasses for you?
- No, that's...
- I'll make them reaI shiny, reaI shiny.
'cause we're friends, huh, George?
We're friends.
Bum:
Nope.
Man:
is this it?
Nope.
Is this it?
Nope.
- Is this it?
- Pam: No, George.
I can't delay
the broadcast
because the mayor is supposed
to be coming out any minute.
Where is he?
No. I've looked
all over.
I don't see a
Noodles Maclntire.
Maclntosh
at your service.
Yeah, George, never mind.
I think I found him.
Come on! Come on!
We go now live to U-62's
Pamela Finklestein
on the steps
at City Hall.
Thank you. Hi.
Pamela Finklestein here.
Boy, it's quite a scene
this morning
on the front
steps of City Hall.
We're awaiting the emergence
of Mayor Thompson
from his annuaI
city budget meeting.
I think he... oh yeah, here comes
the mayor now. Let's go over.
Maybe we can get a
few words out of him.
Oh!
Oh, did I do that?
Oopsie!
Noodles, those things
are fragile.
You should be
more carefuI.
Here he is now.
I think that we should be able...
Hey, sweetheart,
take my advice.
Broads don't belong
in broadcasting.
Fletcher III.:
Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
Hi. Richard Fletcher.
ChanneI 8 news.
Yeah, but...
yeah, but...
"broads don't belong
in broadcasting"?
Is that the kind of
professionaI courtesy
you teach
your news department?
Why, that's just terrible.
I don't know how many times
I've told those boys
never call chicks
"broads. "
Why, you slimy... oh!
Hello, and welcome
to town talk.
I'm George Newman,
and today our speciaI guest
is locaI high schooI
shop teacher Joe Earley.
Joe, thanks
forjoining us.
Thank you,
home boy.
George: Well, I see you've brought
some equipment with you today.
Would you mind giving us
a little demonstration?
Not at all.
There's only a few
simple principles
you must bear in mind
before attempting
to operate
a sophisticated piece
of machinery like this...
Table saw.
You know,
lots of times,
when my students
first learn to...
Whoa!
What?
Oh!
Do you
believe this?
Oh, will you
look at that?
Oh.
Just call me
Mr. Butterfingers.
Um, I think it's
on the floor...
somewhere.
Oh.
Is my face red!
Oh.
Honey, where's
the spatula?
Okay, kids, let's go.
Announcer:
There's just one place to go
for all your
spatula needs.
Spatula City!
Spatula City!
A giant warehouse
of spatulas for every occasion.
Thousands to choose from
in every shape, size, and color.
And because we eliminate
the middleman,
we can sell all our spatulas
factory-direct to you.
Where do you go when you wanna buy
name-brand spatulas
at a fraction of retaiI cost?
Spatula City!
Spatula City!
And, this weekend only, take advantage
of our speciaI liquidation sale.
Buy 9 spatulas, get the 10th one
forjust one penny.
Don't forget, they make
great Christmas presents.
And what better way
to say "I love you"
than with the gift
of a spatula?
Spatula City!
Spatula City!
Hello. This is Sy Greenblum,
president of Spatula City.
I liked their spatulas so much,
I bought the company.
Announcer: Spatula City!
Seven locations!
We're in the yellow pages
under "spatulas. "
My! Where did you get
that lovely spatula?
Hey, kids, where
do you want to go?
To Uncle Nutzy's clubhouse.
That's right!
I'm your Uncle Nutzy,
and, boy, oh, boy are we gonna have
some big fun today.
Huh, kids?
Well, let's walk on over and see
who's in our Kiddie Corner.
- Hi. What's your name?
- Billy.
Billy what?
Okay.
Uh-oh.
You know who that is?
That's right.
It's your paI,
Bob-o the Clown!
Yay!
Hey, Bob-o,
wanna play a game?
Okay, look up. Look down.
Now look at
Mr. Frying Pan.
Uh-oh! Bob-o
fall down, go boom.
Upsie-daisy.
Say, Bob-o,
what's wrong?
Oh, I bet I know.
You're hungry, aren't you?
Well, I know just what you want.
Clowns and kids alike can't resist
the mouth-watering, lip-smacking taste
of Mrs. Hockenburger's
Butter Cookies.
Right, Bob-o?
That's right!
And, hey, Mom,
they're nutritious, too!
Just look at how much
Bob-o here likes them.
Mmm. That's good.
And don't forget, kids,
there's a nifty surprise
inside every box of
Mrs. Hockenburger's...
uh-oh.
Bob-o's been eating
Yappy's Dog Treats.
That's right,
Yappy's Dog Treats.
Your dog will love
that reaI liver and tuna taste...
...with just a
hint of cheese.
Hi.
Pamela Finklestein here,
coming to you with an interview
with Mr. EarI Ramsey.
Now, Mr. Ramsey is
the president of the locaI chapter
of the American Gun Association.
Um, Mr. Ramsey,
is it correct to assume
that your organization
is against gun controI?
Gun controI is
for wimps and Commies.
Listen, let's get
one thing straight.
Guns don't kill people.
- I do.
- Pam: Yes, well...
Announcer: This is a speciaI bulletin
from the U-62 news room.
Hi, Teri.
It's George.
Happy Birthday.
Hey, how about if I take you
and your folks out to dinner?
I'll meet you
at Cafe Francais at 7:30, okay?
I love you.
Announcer: Are you tired
of sloppy, cut-rate funerals?
You've tried the rest.
Now try the best.
The Plots-R-Us
Mortuary Service.
Remember, there's always
plenty of free parking,
and don't forget to visit
our new salad bar.
Plots-R-Us,
eternaI peace
at affordable prices.
Granny Clampett on TV:
Dad-blamed Beverly Hills.
There ain't a possum shank
to be bought around here at any price.
What good is
having $68,000,000?
I ask you!
Well, this morning is good for getting
a lot of papers signed for Mr. Drysdale.
You was doing that
when I left here...
Huh.
George?
Hey, George.
I finished polishing
all the doorknobs.
Is there anything else
you want me to do?
No, Stanley.
That's okay.
It's getting pretty late.
Why don't you call it a night?
Oh... do I have to?
Yeah. Go on.
I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
I'll see you.
George, you know,
I was wondering, like...
like, if you were traveling
through outer space,
II mean, like, you're going reaI fast,
like the speed of light,
you know, and all of a sudden,
you started screaming,
"Ahh! Ahh!"
Do you think that your
brain would blow up?
Uh, guys, I'm trying to work.
Do you mind?
No, I... I don't mind.
Go... go right ahead.
Do you mind, George?
Would you care
to order now?
Oh, yeah. I think
we'll have the...
No, thank you.
We'll wait.
Are you sure he knows
what restaurant we're at?
Well, I've got some good news
and some bad news.
Okay, give me the
bad news first.
Well, given our present
financiaI situation,
compounded
by ongoing fixed expenses
and outstanding invoices,
I figure this station will be flat broke
by the end of the week.
What's the good news?
I lied.
There is no good news.
I never should have
taken this job.
I should have known
it would turn out like all the others.
You know,
for a short time there,
I really thought
this was gonna be different.
I just don't
know anymore.
Well, at least
I've still got Teri.
- What time is it?
- Uh, 9:30.
Oh, no!
Hello?
George Newman?
You are a selfish,
thoughtless,
insensitive creep,
and from now on,
you can forget all my birthdays
because we're through.
Hey, kids, where
do you want to go?
That's right,
to Uncle Nutzy's Clubhouse.
And, boy, oh, boy,
are we gonna have
big fun today.
We're gonna have
so much fun,
we'll forget about
how miserable we are
and how much
life sucks
and how we're all gonna
grow old and die someday.
- Boy: I wanna go home.
- Shut up, you little weaseI.
Okay.
Right now I'd like to show you
one of my favorite cartoons.
It's a sad, depressing story
about a pathetic coyote
who spends every waking
moment of his life
in the futile pursuit
of a sadistic roadrunner...
...who mocks him and laughs at him
as he is repeatedly crushed and maimed!
Hope you enjoy it!
Bob: Hey, where
are you going?
- I need a drink.
- You don't drink.
Yeah, but I've been
meaning to start.
Wait a minute.
What about the
rest of the show?
Watch out, Mr. Coyote!
Oh, that's terrible.
Hey, Stanley.
Yeah, George?
How would you like
your own TV Show?
Okay.
You're on.
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
What?
- But, George, what about...
- Bob, it doesn't matter anymore.
It's over.
Bartender:
Yeah. We're watching it, too.
Yeah. I've never
seen anything like it.
Okay, I'll call you later.
Gentlemen,
what can I get you?
Beer.
Blueberry daiquiri.
I'll tell you what, George.
Let's start fresh.
Start a whole
new business.
Maybe we can borrow some money
from your Uncle Harvey.
Oh, right.
We just flushed his TV station
down the toilet.
I'm sure he'd be happy
to lend us money.
So I guess Teri's never going
to speak to you again, huh?
Hey, I didn't
get an umbrella.
Man: look everybody!
He's coming back on!
Hey, welcome back
to "Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse. "
Are you kids
having a good time?
Yeah!
Hey, how about that cartoon?
hat was a weird cartoon, wasn't it?
You know, that cartoon, it reminds me
of a dream I had last week.
I turned into a bird
with a candy-bar head.
And there were these other
birds, you know,
they were all trying to eat my head and
everything, but I got away from them.
Then there was this tree,
you know,
and there was
this weird lizard, you know...
what the...
ooh!
Oh.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh!
I wa... I wanna show you
something... ugh!
I want to show
you something.
This is my new mop.
George, my friend,
he gave me this mop.
It's a pretty good mop.
It's not as good as my first mop.
I miss my first mop,
but this is still a good mop.
Sometimes you just have
to take what life gives you
'cause life is like a mop,
and sometimes life
gets full of dirt and crud
and bugs and hairballs
and stuff.
You... you... you gotta
clean it out.
You... you gotta put it in
here and rinse it off
and start all
over again and...
and sometimes, sometimes life
sticks to the floor so bad,
you know,
a mop... a mop,
it's not good enough...
it's not good enough.
You... you gotta get down there, like,
with a toothbrush, you know,
and you gotta...
you gotta really scrub.
You gotta get it off!
You gotta really try to get it off.
But if that doesn't work,
if that doesn't work, you can't give up.
You gotta... you gotta
stand right up,
you gotta run to
a window, and say,
"Hey! These floors
are dirty as hell
and I'm not gonna
take it anymore!"
- Yeah!
Pam: Yes, ma'am. That's right.
Stanley Spadowski.
Uh-huh. I don't think
that he's married, no.
Well, I think that
he went to Harvard.
I'll see you
kids later.
Hi, George.
Well, I finished with the TV show.
What do you want
me to do now?
Did you have a good
time in there, Stanley?
Yeah!
Oh, boy, it was fun.
Great! How'd you like
to do it every day?
Yeah!
That would be nea...
wait a minute.
Do I still
get to be the janitor?
Sure.
Oh, okay.
It's a deaI.
Well, I'm gonna
go clean the bathroom.
Okay, kids,
where do you want to go?
To "Stanley Spadowski's
Clubhouse"!
Yay!
Uh-huh.
Great.
All right, it's a deaI.
Thanks a lot.
Okay,
talk to you later.
George, wait till
you hear this.
"Stanley Spadowski's
Clubhouse" is sold out
for the next three months.
The sponsors love him.
You know, if we had
a few more shows like this,
we'd really be
in business.
Yeah, I've been
thinking about that.
I've been working
on some new ideas.
Tell me what
you think.
Kuni: Today, one of these
lucky contestants
will win his or her
weight in fish
right here on...
"WheeI of Fish"!
Okay, let's play the game.
We'll start
with yesterday's winner,
Miss Phyllis Weaver.
Are you ready,
Weaver?
I sure am, Kuni.
Okay, you get over there
and spin the WheeI of Fish.
Go ahead.
Give it a big spin!
Come on,
big fish!
Come to Mama!
Come on!
Oh...
a red snapper.
Mmm.
Very tasty.
Okay, Weaver,
listen carefully.
You can hold
onto your red snapper
or you can go
for what's in the box
that Hiro-san is bringing
down the aisle right now!
What's it gonna be?
Box! Fish!
I'll take the box!
The box!
You took the box!
Let's see
what's in the box!
Nothing!
Absolutely nothing!
Stupid!
You're so stupid!
Hello.
My name is Philo,
and welcome to...
"Secrets of the Universe. "
Today we are going to
learn to make plutonium
from common
household items.
Hey, man.
This is RauI Hernandez,
and welcome to...
RauI's Wild Kingdom,
coming to you live
from my apartment.
How about that, huh?
Okay, first thing
we're gonna do today
is check out the wonderfuI world
of turtles.
This is my friend Tommy.
Tommy,
say hello to the nice people.
Hello.
Ha! Isn't he great, huh?
Okay, so, the turtle
is a member of the reptile family,
and he's got this hard,
protective shell
which keeps
predators away,
also provides him with his own home
when he sleeps.
Oh, and he's got these
tiny, teeny little legs
which makes him
move reaI slow.
And not too many
people know this,
but the turtle
is also nature's suction cup.
Watch this.
Did you see that?
It sticks! Ha!
Okay. Oh yeah.
What else I got for you?
Yeah, check this out.
This is my ant farm.
Now, ants are amazing.
They can carry
50 times their own weight,
and they work for
weeks and weeks
building these
intricate little tunnels.
And, oh, yeah, they hate
it when you do this.
Oh, look!
They're really mad now.
Where did you
find this guy?
Me?
I thought you hired him.
For those of you
just joining us,
today we're teaching
poodles how to fly.
Come here,
come here, Foofie.
Ah, Foofie,
are you psyched?
Are you ready?
Okay.
Here we go.
Get ready
and fly!
Oh, man.
You know, sometimes
it takes them a little longer
to learn how
to do it right.
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, shut up, shut up.
Hey, hey. Who's next?
Ah, Gigi.
Oh, man!
Teri's voice: Hi. This is Teri.
I'm not home right now,
so leave a message and
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
George: Teri, I'm sorry!
Come on,
give me one more chance, please!
Come on, Teri!
Teri! Oh, oh!
I'm in hell!
I'm in hell!
Teri!
Teri, pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!
Pick up the phone!
Oh!
Oh, Teri!
Please!
Oh, Teri!
Ah, Richard,
you shouldn't have.
Happy Father's Day, Dad.
What is this
piece of crap?
I thought I told you
I wanted a Rolex!
A Rolex!
- What?
- Sir?
What do you want?
I just thought I ought to tell you, sir,
there's a lot of talk in the street
about this ChanneI 62.
They're starting
to get a pretty strong following.
Excuse me?
- Did you say ChanneI 62?
- Uh-huh.
Do I have to remind you
that we are a network affiliate?
And we're in competition
with other networks,
not with a bunch of punks
broadcasting out of a closet!
- But, sir...
- Do you enjoy wasting my time?
Get out of my office!
And take that
ridiculous thing off!
What's that mean?
What's that mean?
We got a winner!
We got a winner!
Oh, JoeI Miller,
you just found
the marble in the oatmeaI.
You're a lucky, lucky,
lucky little boy.
'Cause you know why?
You get to drink
from the fire hose!
So much fun.
So much fun.
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah!
Open wide!
Whoa ho ho!
JoeI Miller!
Let's hear it for him!
- RauI Hernandez?
- Yeah.
Got the delivery here
for your next show.
Oh, great.
What you got?
Well, let's see,
I got one aardvark, one flamingo,
four porcupines,
two armadillos, three badgers.
Badgers?
Badgers?
We don't need
no stinking badgers!
Announcer: Never before in the history
of motion pictures
has there been
a screen presence
so commanding,
so powerfuI,
so deadly.
He's Conan the Librarian.
Can you tell me where
I can find a book on astronomy?
Don't you know the Dewey decimaI system?
Announcer:
Conan the Librarian.
I'm sorry.
These books
are a little overdue.
Ah.
Announcer:
Conan the Librarian.
Tonight, only on U-62.
Mmm.
This is pretty good water...
tastes like poop.
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
eat some corn flakes.
These are good corn...
whoa!
"Free toy inside. "
"Free toy inside. "
Let's find it.
Don't let your mom know
that you do this.
I want to find the toy.
Oh, look!
It's a toy man.
It's a toy man.
Hey.
Wanna go for a ride?
Oh, boy! Is it fun?
Here, I'll just
tie this around your waist.
Oh... wait a minute!
No, I'll show you.
I don't want to go...
Stop! Stop!
Ahh!
Wasn't that fun?
Oh, stop! I'm dizzy!
No, let's go again.
Ahh!
Okay. How's this
for our new Friday night line-up?
8:00, "Druids On Parade,"
then "The Volcano
Worshipers' Hour,"
followed by
"Underwater Bingo for Teens"
and "Fun with Dirt. "
Why not?
Get this.
I get a call this morning
from a guy who says
he can swallow his own face.
Can you believe that?
I...
Bob?
- What you got there?
- The ratings.
Don't tell me we actually
showed up on the list.
We're number one.
Say what?
W- we beat out
the networks.
Th-this is unbelievable.
Look at these numbers.
We've got three shows
in the top five.
"Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse"
went through the roof.
He got a 60 share!
Do you know what this means?
We're finally
gonna have some reaI money.
George, we're the number
one station in town.
Ahh!
Announcer: There's lots of fun
coming your way
this weekend
on U-62.
First,
slam your way to health
as you "Stay fit!"
With Mike and Spike.
Next, everybody's favorite,
Chef Bernie invites you to go...
"Bowling for Burgers"!
Sunday,
be a part of the excitement
as we premiere our dazzling new
game show
"Strip solitaire"!
And then join us for some
hilarious fun on the all-new
"PracticaI Jokes
and Bloopers"!
And you won't want
to miss "Celebrity Mud Wrestling,"
with this week's speciaI guest,
MikhaiI Gorbachev.
Whoa!
Announcer:
It's a whole new weekend on U-62,
the reason
television was invented.
Be there!
Huh huh, yah.
Fletcher: This is indeed
a sad day for ChanneI 8.
We've been number one
in this town for the past 10 years
and now our sponsors
are pulling their accounts.
We're losing valuable
advertising revenue.
We're losing
credibility in the market.
And, why?
Because of some
fly-by-night UHF station!
A UHF station!
This is an embarrassment,
a disgrace!
What do you think R.J. Fletcher, Sr.
would be saying if he were alive today?
"Help, let me out of this box.
I can't breathe in here.
Help. Let me out. "
We've gotta
do something.
We've gotta
do it fast.
Who owns that
station, anyway?
Yo! Heh, heh.
Hey, Big Louie.
What's happening?
Bad news, Mr. Bilchik.
None of your horses came in.
Oh, that's too bad.
So, uh, what's
the damages, huh?
$75,000.
Oh, excuse me, Louie.
I think I got
a little water in the phone here.
How much did you say
that was again?
$75,000.
I'll be expecting
payment in two days.
Two days?
Hey, listen, Louie.
Uh, I might need
a little bit more time, huh?
Friday night, 10:00.
75,000 in cash.
I'm dead meat.
- Yeah, what?
- Fletcher: Mr. Bilchik?
This is R.J. Fletcher.
Can I help you?
No, thanks.
Just taking a few measurements.
Wait a minute.
I think I missed something here.
Oh, didn't I tell you?
I own this place now.
You what?
What's the matter, kid,
you got wax in your ears?
George:
But my uncle Harvey...
Harvey Bilchik is flying
in tonight to close the deaI.
I don't believe this.
- Hold this, kid.
- George, do something.
Hey!
W- wait a minute.
Don't you already
own ChanneI 8?
I mean, isn't it illegaI to own two
television stations in the same town?
Oh...
really?
Gee...
I guess I'll have to
turn this place into a parking lot.
Toodle-oo!
Ha ha ha!
Harvey, I still
don't understand
what this is
all about.
I told you, I just gotta wrap up
a little business deaI,
and I'll be back
in a few days
and I'll tell you
about it then, hmm?
You take care
of yourself, you hear?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Hello?
Oh, hi, George.
It's so good
to hear from you.
How's everything?
He what?
Harvey Bilchik,
get in here!
Uncle Harvey,
at least give me a chance
to match his offer.
Well, let me worry about
where I'm going to
come up with the money.
Yeah. 75,000 in cash
by Friday night.
10:00.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Oh, George,
where are you gonna
come up with that kind of money?
Bob: Yeah, and what are you
gonna do about Fletcher?
George:
Fletcher...
yeah, I wouldn't put anything
past that guy.
If there were only some way
we could keep an eye on him.
Airline announcer:
ContinentaI flight 414 now arriving
from Los Angeles
at gate seven.
Hey.
Fletcher:
Harvey.
Harvey Bilchik.
Great to see you.
R.J. Fletcher.
- Did you have a good flight?
- Yeah.
- Want some peanuts?
- No, thank you.
Mr. Bilchik, while
you're here in town,
I want to make sure that
you're very comfortable.
Anything speciaI you want,
you just let me know.
Now... what do you say
we take care of a little business?
I've got all the
cash right here.
And as soon as
you sign these,
- we can start celebrating.
- Yeah, well, uh, listen...
I- I-I gotta talk
to you about that.
What?
What's wrong?
Well, uh, you see,
the thing is, that, uh,
I promised George
that I'd give him a chance
to get all the money
by Friday night.
What are you talking about?
We had a deaI!
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry
about that,
but it's just something I had to do.
Don't worry about it.
There's no possible way
that kid can come up
with 75,000 bucks
in two days.
TV announcer:
George Newman.
He starts where
the others stop.
Sex with furniture...
what do you think?
Announcer:
The world watched in amazement
as he unlocked
the mysteries
of Al Capone's
glove compartment.
Aha!
Road maps!
Announcer:
He blew the lid off Satanism.
Look,
all I was trying to say...
Oh, shut up,
you pinhead!
You make me sick!
Announcer:
Sometimes shocking,
always controversiaI,
he deals with topics
that the other talk shows
are afraid to touch.
He pries, he pokes,
he digs deep.
He gets the answers.
He gets the facts.
And most of all,
he gets the ratings.
Lesbian Nazi hookers
abducted by UFOs
and forced into
weight-loss programs...
all this week
on "Town Talk. "
George, what's
the matter?
Stanley,
you don't wanna know.
Well...
why'd I ask?
Is there something
I can do to help?
Not unless
you've got $75,000.
Let's see...
no, sorry.
This is ridiculous.
There must be
something I could do.
The U-62 telethon
is on the air!
Hey, Dad,
you'd better turn
on ChanneI 62.
Something funny's
going on.
Bob:
Now, we're not asking for donations.
What we are doing
is offering this town
a unique business
opportunity.
This is one share
of stock in ChanneI 62.
Our goaI over the
next day and a half
is to sell
7,500 of these
at $10 apiece.
If we succeed, then
the station will belong to all of us.
Now, I'm calling out
an SOS!
"Save Our Station. "
We got volunteers right over here.
They'll be taking your money.
They're gonna be working
around the clock for two days
untiI every share is sold.
What do you say, kids?
Can we do it?
I think it's time
you boys paid
our Mr. Spadowski
a little visit.
Stanley: Uh, yeah, I'm calling you
on behalf of our station.
We're having this telethon.
We're trying...
we're really raising
a lot of money here for the channeI.
We'd really appreciate it
if you could help us.
Well, you...
bring your dogs down here.
I'll wash them for you.
Huh?
Pam:
Well, so far, guys,
your response
has really been incredible,
but we've still
got a long way to go.
Remember,
when you buy stock in U-62,
you're not only helping yourself
and your community...
You're doing
great, Stanley.
Now, remember,
you gotta pace yourself.
You got a long way
to go before tomorrow night.
Yeah, I can do it,
George. I can do it.
All right, now,
just take it easy.
- Is there anything I can get you?
- Uh... some Play-Doh.
Okay.
No, no, no, George,
get me some bubbles,
- some reaI big bubbles.
- I'll see what I can do.
Who is it?
Man: Got a pizza here
for Mr. Stanley Spadowski.
Pizza?
For me?
Oh, boy!
I like peppers.
But I love anchovies
because they're
reaI fishy.
Sometimes I just like
to get a pizza
with nothing on it
but anchovies.
No peppers or olives
or onions.
Just anchovies
'cause they're good.
So, are we going
to kill him?
No. The boss just wants us
to keep him on ice for a while.
Easy, easy.
Hey, wait a minute.
You guys aren't
from the pizza place.
Oh, George! George,
you've got to do something.
Every minute that Stanley's not
on the air, we're losing money.
Yeah. Listen, just stall
as long as you can.
- I'm sure he'll turn up.
- Okay.
- What did the police say?
- They're doing everything they can.
I'm telling you, George,
Fletcher's behind this. I just know it.
Stanley: Okay.
I'm thinking of something...
orange.
Something orange.
Orange.
You give up?
It's an orange.
Get it?
This is fun, huh?
Okay. Now I'm thinking
of something...
blue.
Something blue.
Let me kill him.
Please, let me kill him.
What?
Wh... what?
Oh...
what?
Don't you like "Bonanza"?
Bob on intercom: Okay, Philo,
go to commerciaI.
TV announcer:
Next week on U-62...
He's back,
and this time,
he's mad.
"Gandhi II"!
No more
Mr. Passive Resistance.
He's out to
kick some butt.
Ow!
Ugh!
Announcer:
This is one bad mother
you don't wanna
mess with.
Yah!
Don't move, slimeball.
Announcer:
He's a one-man wrecking crew.
But he also knows
how to party.
Give me a steak,
medium rare.
Man:
Hey, baldy!
Announcer:
There is only one law...
his law.
"Gandhi II"!
Hey, mister!
Change?
You got change?
Do you mind?
Get out of my way.
Hey, come on.
Can't you help a guy out?
Anything.
Don't spend it all
in one place.
Wow!
I can't believe it!
Oh, thanks, mister.
Thanks a lot!
Um, Mr. Fletcher?
May I speak to you
for a moment?
PersonneI's that way,
young lady.
No, I'm not here
about a job.
I'd like to talk to
you about ChanneI 62.
ChanneI 62?
Oh, yes.
My demolition team
is looking forward
to turning it into a rubble heap
Saturday morning.
Uh, wait a minute.
Will you please
just listen?
George Newman
has turned that little station
into something
this community cares about.
George Newman
is a two-bit little punk
who should never have stuck his nose
where it didn't belong.
And if he sent you here
to try to make a deaI...
George doesn't
know I'm here.
Look, it just
seems to me that
there's more than enough room
for both of you in this town.
Besides,
a little competition
is always good
for the community.
Fletcher: The community?
Let me tell you something.
This community
means about as much to me
as a festering
bowI of dog snot.
Stanley:
You guys?
Hey, you guys!
The blindfold fell off.
You better
come fix it.
I didn't mean
for it to... whoa!
Hey, my shirt
glows in the dark!
Will you
shut him up?
Stanley: Oh, I got an itch.
I got an itch.
I got an itch.
I got an itch.
I got an itch.
I got an itch.
- I got an itch, I got an itch.
- Stanley.
I don't want to have
to tell you this again.
Shut up.
You're making
us nuts.
Now...
I got three guys out here
that would love
to cut your tongue out,
but I don't want
them to do that.
I told them that in another
couple of hours
this whole thing
will be over,.
So, Stanley,
be nice.
My mop!
Freeze!
Ahh!
- Hey!
- Man: Get him!
- He's getting away!
- Let's get him!
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Get out of my way!
Ugh!
Ugh!
Not gonna get me.
Yeah.
Stanley.
Don't move,
Spadowski.
Don't even breathe.
Wh-what are we
gonna do now?
I'll handle this.
Ah! Ooh!
Whoa.
Oh.
Ahh!
Ahh!
Oh, boy!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Who is this guy?
I'm your worst nightmare.
Listen, I can see you guys
are pretty busy.
How about if I just
come back later?
Forget it, paI.
We're all going
for a little ride.
Oh. Well, we'll have to
take your car.
Mine's a two-seater.
Just shut up, kid.
You know, you really
botched things up.
If you hadn't stuck your face
in our business...
we'd all be going
home reaI soon.
But now I'm gonna
have to take you
and your friend
out of commission...
for good.
Redrum!
Redrum!
Man: What was that?
- Hmm?
- Hold on.
- I thought I heard something.
- What?
- I don't know. I just thought...
- Supplies!
Hey, everybody,
they're back.
Yeah!
Friends,
there comes a time
in every man's life
where he has to look
the potato of injustice
right in the eye.
There's a powerfuI
eviI force in the universe.
And it lives at ChanneI 8.
And I've seen it,
and I don't want it to pop its ugly,
greasy head around here,
- do you?
- No!
- I can't hear you!
- No!
- I can't hear you!
- No!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All right,
say it again.
- No!
- All right!
TV announcer:
And now a speciaI report
from the owner and generaI manager
of ChanneI 8,
R.J. Fletcher.
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
I come before
you tonight
to speak on a matter
which is of grave
concern to us all.
I want to show you
how one small
television station
can single-handedly
disrupt and destroy
the moraI fiber
of an entire community.
The following may upset you.
It may even shock you.
Fletcher: But I feeI it is my duty
as a concerned citizen
to bring you
this important message.
This community means
about as much to me
as a festering bowI
of dog snot.
You think I care about
the pea-brained yokels of this town?
If you took their combined IQ
and multiplied it by 100,
you might have enough intelligence
to tie your shoe,
if you didn't drooI
all over yourself first.
I can't stand those
sniveling maggots.
They make me want to puke.
But there is one good
thing about broadcasting
to a town full
of mindless sheep...
I always know
I've got them
exactly where I want them.
Ha ha ha!
Heh heh heh!
Stanley: Ho ho! Ha ha ha!
$73,000!
Whoo-hoo!
We just hit the
$73,000 mark!
Okay, Mouseketeers,
come on.
We can do it.
Woo!
What do you
say, stranger?
Teri.
What are you
doing here?
I thought you never
wanted to see me again.
Well, whatever gave
you that idea?
Well, I think my first
clue was when you said
you never wanted
to see me again.
Oh.
Well, George...
no matter what
happens tonight,
I just want you to know
that I'm so proud of you.
Uncle Harvey.
Listen, we'll definitely
have the money for you,
it just may take a few minutes longer
than we expected.
Look, kid,
if it was up to me,
I'd let you have all the time
you wanted, but you know,
Big Louie is a very punctuaI
kind of guy, you know what I mean?
I wouldn't wanna
keep him waiting.
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay. I know
a lot of you people
probably like to wait
till the last minute.
Well, this is it!
This is the last minute!
Fletcher:
What are you doing here?
You're disturbing the peace.
Come on.
Out of the way.
Why aren't you home in bed?
Get out of here.
Stand back.
Out of my way.
Look out.
Crowd: Aw!
This party is over,
Mr. Newman.
You can say that again.
Okay, Fletcher...
you win.
Give me the money.
Settle down.
All in good time,
Mr. Bilchik.
What, are you crazy?
Give me the money!
Please,
if you don't mind,
there are a few things
I'd like to say to these people
before this transaction
takes place.
What?
Dear friends,
I'm sure that one day
you'll realize
that by shutting down
this hotbed of
subversive activity...
Hey, mister!
Not now, okay?
I was just wondering
if it's too late
to buy
any of them shares.
I'll take
whatever you got left.
- How much is that?
- $2,000.
Keep the change.
Fletcher: I have decided not
to tear down the building after all.
I am going to turn it
into a laundromat.
Uh,
Mr. Big Louie, sir?
My uncle Harvey
wanted you to have this.
$75,000.
It's all there.
Fletcher: Now let me tell
you something...
Uncle Harvey.
Hey, what's
going on here?
Ha ha ha!
Now, wait
just one minute!
What do think you're doing?
We did it!
The station's ours!
- Wow, look at that!
- You can't do this!
We had an agreement, remember?
An oraI contract.
I'll sue.
Oh, blow it out your
ear, scuzbag.
R.J. Fletcher?
- So what if I am?
- I'm John Vickers, F.C.C.
I've noticed your
that station is late
in filing its license renewaI
this year.
Now, normally,
this kind of violation
is punishable
by a stiff fine,
but I've been
watching you lately.
You made a big
impression on me.
Yeah, I'm revoking
your license.
Effective immediately,
you're off the air.
Hi, Pamela Finklestein
here
coming to you with
the most incredible turn of events.
Not only has the once-powerfuI
corporate broadcasting giant
been thoroughly
crushed and defeated,
but now,
as luck would have it,
they've been completely stripped
of their license by the F.C.C.!
What do you have to say about it,
you worthless, slobbering pig?
Dad?
Where's my dad?
What's going on here?
Whoa!
Noodles:
Oh, did I do that?
Oopsie!
Dad!
Philo!
Hey, you really went beyond the call
of duty on this one, paI. Thanks.
I'm glad to have been
of service, George.
Well, i-i-it appears
my work on this planet is complete.
I must now
return to my home
on the planet Zarkon.
Okay.
Well, have fun.
Hey, nice going, kid.
I didn't know
you had it in you.
- You're okay.
- Thanks, Uncle Harvey.
- Have a nice flight back to the coast.
- Harvey: Thanks.
- Say hi to Aunt Esther for me.
- Sure will.
Excuse me.
Aren't you
R.J. Fletcher?
Yes!
Ooh! Ugh! Ugh!
Yeah!
Hey, Stanley, congratulations.
You really pulled us through.
George, I want you to know that I'm
mighty proud to be a part of your team.
Well, I'm mighty proud
of you, too, Stanley.
In fact, I'd like to present you
with a small token of my gratitude.
A trophy.
That... that's me?
"Stanley...
World's greatest janitor
and TV Star. "
Aw, George,
I never had anybody
give me a trophy before.
It's... it's big.
George, you're my best friend
in the whole world.
I'm gonna go show
everybody right now.
Hey, everybody,
look at what
George gave me!
Hey!
Hey, I know you.
You're the guy
that gave me
that 1955 double-die
Denver mint penny.
Oh, ho, ho,
thanks a lot, mister.
That thing
was worth a fortune.
When I cashed it in,
I got enough money
to buy a whole bunch of shares,
plus I got me
a reaI neat watch.
It's a Rolex.
See?
Um, George?
Uh-huh?
You know those dreams
you're always having?
Yeah?
Well, do you think
that maybe sometime
I could be
part of them?
Honey, from now on,
you're gonna be
in all of 'em.
Oh, George.
Darlin', let's leave
this place right now.
Let's go this
very minute.
No, dear, please.
Let's wait till tomorrow.
But why? Why?
Because tomorrow
is another day.
I knew she was
going to say that.
