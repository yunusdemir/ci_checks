We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in
this decade and do the other things...
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.
- Look at that.
- That's beautiful.
It's gotta be one of the most
proud moments of my life...
I guarantee you.
For century upon century...
to explore the moon
was considered...
the dream of the addlebrained
or foolhardy.
Only divine beings, or supermen...
could withstand the rigors
and distance of such a journey.
But then,
early in the 20th century...
mortal humans went aloft
on mechanical wings...
defying gravity and redefining
the realm of possibility.
Forever after...
the moon became a goal
within the grasp of those on Earth.
For if man could build a machine
to make him fly...
he would eventually build one
to take him to the moon.
When and how and who...
was only a matter of time.
From December of 1968
to December of 1972...
24 representatives
of the human race...
voyaged to the moon...
and half as many
walked upon its surface.
In all, nine voyages...
across the quarter-million-mile
distance...
from earthly safety
to lunar emptiness.
Each one of them
dangerous and expensive.
The requirements
to make the voyage a reality...
were the qualities
that make humankind unique.
Our desire to achieve...
our wherewithal and perseverance...
our willingness to sacrifice
time, energy and even life...
in the long labor needed
to solve the problems one by one...
over the course
of the endeavor.
Most important of all
was humankind's tendency...
to imagine things
that are not possible.
Imagining that it could be done
was the very first step taken...
in the journey
from the Earth to the moon.
I was very energetic in 1902...
and I was working
for the great George Melies...
who I had met at the Theatre Houdin
in Paris.
He was beginning, then,
to work with film...
and I was in love with the magic
that came out of his camera...
which wasn't all that different
from the ones...
you use right now.
Films had been of ordinary things...
like a train coming
into a station...
or a wall being torn down.
He came to me one day and said...
"Jean-Luc...
I want to tell
an amazing story with my camera.
I want to take people
on the most amazing trip."
I thought he meant a trip
to someplace literal.
To Lyon or Marseille.
Then he said...
"Let's take a voyage
to the moon."
And I said...
"How about Nice? It's closer."
But the moon was in
Monsieur Melies' eyes...
and this is what he designed
and built...
at the Star Film Studios...
in Montreal.
Monsieur Melies had constructed...
the largest film studio
in the world at that time.
Between 1896 and 1913,
he produced over 100 films...
each more magical and inventive
than the other.
Actors, visual effects specialists...
carpenters, costumes...
all under the direct supervision...
of Monsieur Melies.
Yes.
Too much powder,
and he burns my set down.
I know.
Don't use too much powder!
And too little
and it will not photograph.
Too little and you're gonna waste
all of our time.
I will use as much
as Monsieur Melies demands.
- See a test?
- Yes, please.
Could you set it off, please?
One, two, three, set it off.
One, two and three.
- Idiot! That's too much.
- No, it's perfect.
It's perfect. Do you hear?
That much. No more, no less.
Monsieur Melies oversaw every moment
of the making of the film.
He was also the lead actor...
playing the professor,
Barbenfouillis.
- Is the grinder ready?
- I will find out!
One moment, sir.
Is the grinder ready? Yes?
No? Please, talk to me.
Thank you.
Look at this.
We're already fighting the night.
Monsieur Melies,
we are almost ready.
I know.
I'm no longer George Melies.
I'm Professor Barbenfouillis.
Bring it up!
Up high. High.
- Is the grinder ready?
- Grinder's ready.
Start the grinder!
Everyone is talking.
Anticipation in the air.
Come, the astronomers.
You are sure of yourselves...
accomplished
and full of pride.
You greet the assembled
and bow.
Very good.
And now, the pages enter.
Enter the pages. Please hand
the telescopes to the astronomers.
Admire the telescopes,
astronomers.
And exit the pages.
Respectfully, nice.
And now comes Barbenfouillis.
I bow to you, sausages.
- Now I take my place above you all.
- Get ready.
And slowly...
raise your telescopes
above your head.
Hold it there a moment.
Stop the grinder!
Melies would have us
stop the film...
and run in with whatever it was
that was needed...
to suddenly appear.
We make the exchange...
run back off...
- start the camera and...
- Lights.
voila...
the special effect of magic
on the screen.
Your telescopes
have magically changed into stools.
Sit, gentlemen,
and here we are.
We will create a huge cannon...
which will fire...
a hollow projectile containing
myself and yourselves.
This is beginning
to sound strange to you...
and you murmur about this.
And I say,
this projectile...
will actually journey...
all the way
from the Earth to the moon.
But you say to yourself,
"This is madness"...
and you act
like this is madness!
You say, "This is impossible."
And I say,
"No, it is not impossible."
Come to me.
Say I'm nuts.
You're nuts.
You're crazy.
How dare you!
I throw papers at you.
Look at this chaos.
Mayhem breaks out
among the scientists...
and all this because
I propose a voyage...
to the moon.
How was it?
I think it was
a good one, no?
I'm the last man
to walk on the moon.
Not that anyone gives a shit.
Can I say "shit"
or should I watch my language on this?
I can make the claim of being
the last person to set foot on the moon.
It's really
how you look at it, see?
I got out of the LM after Gene did.
So that would make me
the twelfth and final person...
to make footprints up there.
It's not like I get stopped
at restaurants because of it.
I will bet you $50
and a box of donuts...
no one knows the names
of the last two men to walk on the moon.
And I will tell you why.
Because they didn't die up there.
They flew
a near-flawless mission.
They did a hell of a job
up there on the moon...
and they came back
in one piece.
But if you didn't get
a NASA paycheck...
you never even knew
their names.
Eugene Cernan
was a veteran astronaut...
who walked in space
on Gemini 9 in 1966.
Exhausted and overheated
in his pressure suit...
he lost 15 pounds
in the effort.
Gambling that
the Apollo program...
would remain funded by Congress...
he held out for command
of Apollo 17...
rather than take the job
of lunar module pilot...
on john Young's 16 flight.
Harrison Schmitt-
or "jack," as he is known-
went to the moon
with a special relish.
The first and only scientist
to go...
he was a geologist by trade...
and an astronaut by choice.
He had also been instrumental
in the training of every man...
to walk on the moon before him.
He almost didn't get
to go himself.
- Hey, ta da!
- Congratulations.
- What?
- You're going to the moon!
- What?
- Apollo 17, you're on the crew.
- Yeah.
- I have not heard a thing.
- Come on.
- You will.
They came to their senses over there.
They're sending one of us.
You'll be the first egghead
on the moon.
Come on. Have a drink
for once in your life.
I don't celebrate rumors.
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.
Harrison Schmitt.
Yes. My sister.
No! No, I haven't heard anything.
I'll let you know when I do.
Yeah. Bye.
I don't know
what they're waiting for.
NASA stands for
"Never absolutely sure of anything."
Harrison Schmitt.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
I will do the best job
I possibly can.
Thank you.
Your drink, sir.
Gentlemen...
to the exploration
of the moon.
They might have rued the day
that they made the change.
I always had
some strong ideas...
about where we were going
on the moon...
and forcefully suggested them.
Jack had no problem
picking up the phone...
and calling the President
of the United States...
if he had an idea
about where or what...
we should be doing with Apollo.
- Like giving us that fourth E.V.A.
- The fourth E.V.A.
Where we should land.
Flights rules were not going
to be rewritten...
just for me and Jack
to make that last trip out.
Chris Kraft stopped me
in the hallway one day...
and he pretty much told me
exactly how it was going to be.
- Gene-o.
- Yes, boss.
- Want to put the white scarf away?
- Come again?
Lose the throttle jockey act.
I got all the memos I need
on Apollo 17.
All these ideas
from you and your partner.
You want an extra E.V.A.
on the moon?
You're lucky
you even have a mission.
Look. A lot of people think
we should quit while we're ahead.
The system's already
stretched to the limit.
Jesus, we're so tight
on weight constraints...
we're talking about cutting the number
of Band-Aids in the first aid kit.
Six Band-Aids instead of 12.
That's enough.
Here's your number one
mission rule.
Tattoo this to your eyelids.
Don't take any chances.
Just come back alive.
All right, nice and easy.
With grace.
As he did
with his theatrical productions...
Monsieur Melies designed
every aspect of his film...
and was quite fanatical.
You must react
with spirit and soul!
When things went wrong...
things went wrong,
and he would scream.
These girls!
- Ladies, you were fine.
- You're fired!
I will.
You guys are fired.
When things were not so bad...
he was not so bad.
This is how it is
when you are working with a genius.
But it was not
during the filming...
that Melies worked
his true magic.
It was later...
in the laboratory
and the projection room...
where I saw he was
up to something incredible...
something that had
never been seen before.
A complete, fantastic story...
told in one marvelous film.
I don't know, boss.
So many cuts.
So much glue,
I hope it holds.
If it doesn't work,
no soup for you.
Well, that's all right.
It's lousy soup.
- How dare you? Is it ready?
- Here goes.
There we are.
The intrepid voyagers.
Yes.
Wave to the assembled.
Climb into the projectile.
It is pushed into the cannon...
by so many pretty maidens.
Yes, give us a wave.
Dissolves, superimpositions,
double exposures.
Monsieur Melies was a genius.
Boss...
you are a genius.
The cannon...
ready to be fired,
and boom!
Roger.!
The clock has started.
We have liftoff.
Apollo 17 has turned midnight
into dawn.
Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans
and Harrison Schmitt...
flying through the automated
roll program of the spacecraft...
begin America's-
and perhaps all of mankind's-
final voyage to the moon.
Three men inside
the command module America...
with the lunar module Challenger
in tow....
journey now to the moon.
Most of the world
and much of America...
views Apollo 17
as an undertaking...
either commonplace or wasteful.
Regardless...
to be here, once again,
in the presence...
of such glorious force...
aimed at such
a heavenly target as the moon...
one can only marvel and ask...
"How have we done this?"
"How have we sent
mankind to the moon?"
Okay, Houston...
as I step down to the surface
at Taurus-Littrow-
No one on the planet Earth
saw Gene Cernan...
first set foot
on the moon's surface.
Norjack Schmitt.
Unbelievable.!
The Apollo 17 TV camera
would not be operative...
until the lunar rover
was deployed and powered up.
When it was...
crystal-clear video pictures
from the surface of the moon...
were transmitted to the world
by way of a television camera...
controlled from a console
in Mission Control...
by Ed Fendel.
With a lag of six seconds...
the time it took for his commands
to reach the moon...
and the picture to travel back
to Earth...
he was the director
of arguably...
the most unique television show
of all time.
The ratings were nonexistent.
The networks didn't cover the mission...
except on the morning shows...
and an occasional update.
In July of 1969...
the entire world stopped...
to watch Buzz and Neil...
and the one giant leap.
The picture was so bad, a lot of people
couldn't even make it out.
12, the color camera went out
so there was no TV.
No matter what they tried.
Apollo 13...
was a news story
unlike any other in history.
But it...
takes nearly another year...
for Al Shepard
to practice his golf swing.
15 and 16 had the Rover...
and the color camera.
But by this time...
no one was watching.
They'd moved on
to other things.
Color television
from the moon...
took a few moments of their time.
Nothing more.
Oh, bury me not
On the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl
Where the coyotes howl
And the winds blow free
Okay, let's see.
Where am I?
In a geologist's paradise,
if I ever saw one.
I just snuck a quick peek at the drill,
and it does work.
I just took time out
for a snack of a little water.
- What's that?
- That must be Ron.
Houston, you wanna tell Evans
he's got his VHF on.
Oh, no, you won't believe it.
I did it again? Hit the wrong button
on the gravimeter?
No, there goes the fender.
I caught it with my hammer.
Oh, shoot.
Oh, golly.
Oh, boy.
I couldn't stop myself
before the damage was done.
Oh, boy. I'm gonna deploy
this package here.
We're gonna have to stop here.
Let me try to get that fender back on.
Otherwise the dust
will cover everything.
- Is the tape under my seat?
- Yeah.
Oh, man.
Hey, Jack.
Just stop.
You owe yourself 30 seconds...
to take a look up
over the south massif..
and look at the Earth.
You seen one Earth,
you've seen them all.
That's the biggest difference
between Jack and me.
Every spare second that I had...
I was trying to take in
everything that I was doing...
everything that I was seeing.
I'm trying to grab
another look up at the Earth...
focusing on this great adventure...
that I was living in time,
in space, in reality.
I mean, there it was up there...
surrounded by...
nothingness.
The darkest black imaginable.
I could see that it was night time
in England and lunchtime in Texas...
with just a casual glance...
as though I were a passenger...
on a time machine
with a big picture window in it...
just looking out.
I just couldn't get
enough of it.
I was looking at the rocks.
Our time was so limited....
and the best instrument in the world
for scientific observation...
is a pair of trained eyes...
and an educated brain
to process information.
There we were.
This fantastic field site.
Well...
I was looking at the rocks.
I mean, when you can see
the layers of geologic history...
that's what I was there for.
After extended problems
with the gravimeter...
and the lunar surface
experiment package...
and a time-consuming fix...
to the broken fender
of the Rover...
Cernan and Schmitt were allowed
to travel only half as far...
as their first E. V.A.
had originally called for.
By the time they were
back inside Challenger...
and repressurized
to five P.S.I...
the two moon walkers
had been outside...
for seven hours and 12 minutes...
almost three times longer...
than all of Neil Armstrong's
and Buzz Aldrin's exploration...
of the Sea of Tranquility.
And Apollo 17 had
two more moonwalks to go.
Rehearsing. Here we are.
We've touched down
on the moon.
Out, everyone.
Out quickly.
You're excited,
can't believe where you are!
It's amazing.
Look at this amazing scene.
- The mountains.
- Out they come. Out.
Now, over here.
Raise your arm.
Raise up.
That's when we'll stop the grinder.
- Stop the grinder there.
- Can we move this? Come on!
One, two, three.
- Quickly, quickly.
- Don't move.
Out comes the projectile.
It'll be faster, boss. Don't worry.
All right, so raise your arm.
Raise your arm.
Good.
Don't move.
Keep up your arms.
And we will then
start the grinder.
Get out of the way.
We want the grinder to see the Earth.
- We're turning again.
- We want the Earth rising...
slowly...
and let's drop the mountains.
Lower the first rail.
No, first the Earth
begins to rise.
First the Earth rises!
Then drop the mountains.
Then the mountains lower.
Earth rise, mountains lower.
It'll be perfect tomorrow, boss.
I guarantee it.
And ready volcano?
Volcano!
Boom!
The volcano should be a little
farther offstage. Can you get it?
Stop. You're doing a lousy job
and bitching for nothing.
We'll do that.
Now get up. Stretch.
Here they are.
No, they will be, boss.
I promise.
I guarantee it.
- They will be there.
- Let will let us covers ourselves.
Special blankets for the moon.
Lay on the moon
and dream of the star maidens.
And out they come,
the star maidens.
When the sun is over the roof,
we'll shoot the scene.
If we have the sun, boss.
Please, Lord,
give us the sun.
Good morning, Challenger.
We have some special
wake-up music for you...
from the old folks of the LMP
at Cal Tech.
Eight miles high
Being the commander has some advantages.
One of those is driving the Rover.
Every time I'd go down a hill,
I'd put Jack on the down slope side.
Not once did Gene-o drive with me
on the uphill side.
He usually only had
three wheels on the surface...
and me feeling like we were
gonna tip over any minute.
Good eye.
For the second E. V.A...
Cernan and Schmitt
were well rested...
and had the time-consuming chores
behind them.
I think we've got another one
coming here.
With ten stations scheduled...
the pair drove off
over five miles...
from the safety
of Challenger...
with the single-minded task
of doing as much work...
in the allotted time
as was humanly possible.
While the astronauts
were in transit on the moon...
there was no television signal.
In Houston,
Flight Director Gerry Griffin...
managed the activities
through the voice contact...
of Capcom Bob Parker...
who tried to keep the astronauts
on schedule.
Roland pitch should be
fairly flat.
The F-stop
for the 500 millimeter...
should be the same
as for the 70.
Gene, you might want to take
some shots of those massifs...
if they look interesting.
If they look interesting?
What kind of thing is that to say?
Bob, up frame count 36
is the outcrop...
where the boulders
at the top of the south massif-
Oh.! Hey, here's something different.
It's a chunk
of yellow-brown rock...
that apparently has
several spots behind it.
To find a sample...
with such a vivid color
on the surface of the moon.
That would be evidence
of volcanic activity...
the one-time presence
of water or oxygen.
It was exactly the kind of find...
you'd want to make
on a place like the moon.
Of course, it turned out
it was too good to be true.
Oh, no.
What is that?
Oh, that's a reflection.
Oh, that really fooled me.
It's a reflection
off the mylar on the Rover.
I thought I had something there.
Crazy.
Well, what the heck?
I'll sample it anyway.
SCB 32 Easy
is just another small fragment.
"Just another small fragment."
You bet that gave the guys
in the geology backroom a jolt.
Seeing as how Jack
was one of us...
we never thought he would lie to us.
The hallmark of any geologist
is impeccable integrity.
But that little episode...
that had us going
for a bit.
So what other things can reflect
off the Rover up there?
Does it have taillights?
- Hubcaps.
- Maybe he left the parking lights on.
Don't do that
to us again, Jack.
Okay, Shorty is clearly
a darker-rimmed crater.
The inner wall is quite blocky...
except for the western
portion of it.
The floor is hummocky...
as we thought it was
in the Apollo 15 photographs.
If it had been a perfect world
for us geologists...
Jack would've had
his own TV camera...
just for the ground science team.
Come on, Gene.
Turn on the TV.
The central peak-
if you will-
or the central mound...
is very blocky,
very jagged.
And the impression I have...
of the other mounds
in the bottom...
is that they look like slump masses
that may have come off the side.
- We got it!
- Thanks, Gene. Now get out of the way.
Come on, Cernan. Move!
Parade around, Jack.
Grab us a sample of that sucker.
A very large boulder
of very intensely fractured rock...
right on the rim.
Where on the rim?
We can't-
It looks like
a finely vesicular version...
of our clinopyroxene gabbro.
It's obviously crystalline.
Do you have TV?
Yes!
We have TV.
And you might brush the lens
for us...
before you move
out of the way.
I'm gonna take a quick pan
while I'm waiting for you.
Okay.
Oh, hey.
There is orange soil.
There is orange soil here.
I knew by the tone
ofJack's voice...
that this orange soil
was the real thing.
We just wanted to see it
on the TV.
It's all over.
It's all over.
- He said it's all over the place.
- Zoom in!
- Pan. Take a good look around.
- Tell him to bring it to the camera.
Make sure that the sunlight's
hitting it at the right angle.
- It is. I can see it from here.
- It's orange.
Wait a minute.
Let me pull my visor up.
It's still orange!
I'm gonna have to dig
a trench here, Houston.
Boy, it's almost the same color
as the LMP decal on my camera.
How can there be
oxidized soil on the moon?
It looks just like
oxidized desert soil.
That's exactly right.
You know, that orange,
it runs in a line, Gene-o.
- Right along the rim crest.
- What, circumferential?
If there was anything
that looked...
like a fumarole alteration...
this is it.
That's it!
That's the volcanic event!
The bad news was
that the orange was not...
a fumarole alteration,
nor was it oxidized.
Now these were perfectly normal...
preliminary assumptions to make...
about an unexamined sample...
but it turned out
that it was orange volcanic glass...
from a fire fountain
that happened 3.5 billion years ago.
But that did not diminish
anyone's excitement...
about that find,
or, frankly, its importance.
I think Jack and I
did as solid an E.V.A...
as anyone could have
on that second time out.
Some of the best work ever done
in all of Apollo.
There was one thing
I really wanted to do out there though.
Well, it had to do
with my daughter, Tracy.
Did he promise to bring you anything?
Well, I asked him to bring
a rock back from the moon...
He said if he could,
he would bring me one back.
And he said if he couldn't,
he'd bring me a moonbeam.
- A what?
- A moonbeam.
A moonbeam.
He's either pullin' your leg
or you're pullin' mine.
That's what he said.
Before my father
walked on the moon...
he told me he was gonna do
something very special up there.
He said he was going to carve
my initials in the lunar dust...
making me the only little girl
with her name on the moon.
And that it would last for thousands
and thousands of years.
Just like his footprints
is what he'd say.
Of course,
I was nine years old at the time...
and I had very little concept
of what he was talking about.
The moon is roughly five times
the size of the continent of Africa.
In all, the Apollo missions spent
more than 12 days on its surface...
but less than three-and-a-half days
actually exploring its mysteries.
In the 75 hours Challenger
sat in the Taurus-Littrow Valley...
the crew spent 24 hours of them
in scheduled rest periods.
No, I didn't do much sleeping
on the moon.
No. No more than catnaps, really.
I was waking up
every few hours.
I just couldn't do it.
Not that I sat up
writing poetry or anything.
But the knowledge of being
where I was...
kept me up
and looking around.
And it wasn't because
I was scared or anything.
It was just the fact that I was actually
trying to do something so fantastic...
it made it impossible.
Jack, he slept like a baby...
with the sweetest dreams
you can imagine, I suppose.
Mankind's final day on the moon...
came with the Earth's face
having waned by 15%.
The day would bring the last
seven hours of human footfall...
on the face of another world.
The longer you stay on the moon,
minute by minute...
the better the chances are
for something to go wrong.
Now I will tell you,
without hesitation...
even with there being
nothing wrong at all...
that last E.V.A.
was as anxious a time...
as I ever spent in NASA.
- That's affirmed.
- Okay, here comes the hatch.
- I can see daylight through it.
- Okay, the hatch is full open.
With a stiff suit,
I'm still at 4.5 P.S.I.
Okay, but I am out here
on the porch.
Okay, I'm going down
the ladder.
Godspeed,
the crew of Apollo 17.
I remember my visit
to Mission Control quite vividly...
for it was the day
I saw the impossible.
Oh, I knew the Americans
had walked on the moon.
I had seen the pictures.
But the immediacy...
of actually being there
in Houston at the same time...
it did something to my consciousness
that had not yet happened.
It came at a moment...
when the man operating the camera...
turned it toward the Earth...
and he zoomed in very slowly.
And the picture was-
It was so good.
I could actually make out
the oceans...
and the continents and the clouds.
It suddenly hit me...
that we were looking
at ourselves.
It was as if our own eyes
were on the moon...
and somehow we could
turn them around...
and look back down
and see everything we have...
everything we know,
everything we are...
all at the same time.
I wanted to run outside
and wave at the moon...
and run back inside.
See if I could see myself.
Turning Point Rock
was so named...
because it was the station
farthest away from the Challenger...
on the final E. V.A.
of Apollo 17.
What looked like in orbit
to be one huge boulder...
that had skidded to a stop
in the valley...
was, in fact,
five different boulders...
each the size of a house.
The Turning Point
is where I should have done it.
I thought later on, "If I had just put
Tracy's initials on a boulder...
that would have been
an incredible picture."
You know? T.D.C. in the lunar dust
up there for the rest of time...
but hell,
I was so tired and so busy...
the opportunity
got away from me.
I don't think
I can get to the top.
I just gotta get
to a place...
where I can get a pan from.
Okay, I think
I'll save some water.
All right.
Back on intermediate.
That cools you off
real fast.
Hey, there's Challenger.
Holy smoley.!
The lunar module
was three miles away...
and that was our home.
We were up on the side
of the north massif working.
Just two
lunchbox-totin' Joes.
You can talk all you want about
what it's like to go to the moon...
and to live and work on the moon.
I can tell you,
I already did that.
I had a house up there.
I had a job.
I lived up there
for three days.
You know, Jack,
when we finish with station eight...
we will have covered this whole valley
from corner to corner.
That was the idea.
But I didn't think we'd ever really
quite get to that far corner.
But we are going to make it.
Son of a gun,
the commander just fell down.
- You okay?
- Yeah, Commander's okay.
When you're tired,
when you're close to being finished...
and you think everything
is going perfectly...
and you got it made...
that's when something terrible
can happen.
That's when disaster
can strike.
Another savage attacks
and poof !.
And they escape the-
and are about to leave
the lunar surface.
Ah, danger.
Will they survive? Yes! They are led
by Professor Barbenfouillis.
Monsieur Melies was on the precipice
of celebrity and greatness...
as well as getting
very, very rich.
Poof !. A savage
of the other world disappears.
Poof again.
Poof. And again.
As was his due,
he had created...
La Voyage Dans La Lune.
But then,
it all came crashing down.
But they're on their way home...
and splash in the ocean.
It goes deep, deep, deep, deep,
and they come up.
Yes, they come up
to the surface...
and the navy brings them
to safe harbor.
I'm going to take my movie
in America.
Make a hundred prints of it,
take them to the city of New York...
book a theater
and let words of my films spread...
across this huge, rich land...
and I will make a fortune
out of this.
Poor Monsieur Melies.
He did not know
that Le Voyage Dans La Lune...
was already playing in America.
And he was not ever going
to see a penny from it.
Agents of the American genius and thief,
Monsieur Thomas Edison...
had seen the film in London.
They bribed the theater owner...
took the film into a lab...
and made copy after copy
after copy of it.
The film was a sensation
in America.
A fortune was made
off its exhibition.
None of it-
not a penny-
going into the pockets
of Monsieur George Melies.
Within a few years...
he was broke.
- We should have TV.
- We're gettin' TVthere, Gene-o.
- You getting it?
- We've got TV.
Well, let me take a look.
With the final E. V.A.
nearly completed...
Gene Cernan drove the Rover...
a few hundred feet
away from the Challenger...
to its final resting place...
a parking spot
where it still sits today.
He would need the clamps that held
together the quick-fix fender...
for inside the LM
during ascent.
A good fender,
he took back as a souvenir.
Pressed for time...
and with a long walk
back to the landing site...
the commander of Apollo 17
stole the luxury...
of a last look
at his home on the moon...
then performed one last,
very personal task.
With Mission Control reminding him
time was running out...
Jack Schmitt hurried
to prepare the last bags...
filled with priceless
lunar samples...
for the long transport
to Earth.
With the clock ticking
and his life support...
diminishing with every breath...
the only scientist
to ever walk on the moon...
came to a melancholy realization.
His time there was over.
We need you in the LM
in one-five minutes, 15 minutes...
because of oxygen restraints.
I copy that.
I don't need my hammer anymore.
Tell them to move it along.
What we want you to do
is dust and get in.
We got one-four minutes.
Let me throw the hammer.
Okay.
Let me throw the hammer, please.
It's all yours.
You deserve it.
You're a geologist.
You ought a be able
to be the hammer thrower.
- You ready?
- Go ahead. Don't hit the LM.
Bob, this is Gene,
and I'm alone on the surface.
That's why I'm the last man
to walk on the moon.
Jack was already
inside Challenger...
so it was just me out there.
That last footprint on the moon,
check it out.
It just happens to be
my boot size.
And as I take
man's last step from the surface...
back home, for now...
but we believe not too long
into the future.
I'd just like to say what I believe
history will record.
That America's challenge
of today...
has forged man's destiny
of tomorrow.
And as we leave the moon
at Taurus-Littrow...
we leave...
as we came...
and God willing,
as we shall return...
with peace and hope...
for all mankind.
Godspeed, the crew of Apollo 17.
Descent engine override.
Logic in.
Okay.
Rate scale:
25 degrees per second.
Attitude translation:

Fourjets on.
Take your final look
at the valley at Taurus-Littrow.
The TV camera on the Rover...
was broadcasting live pictures...
of Challenger's
liftoff from the moon...
making Ed Fendel...
the most nervous man
in all of NASA.
The camera on Apollo 15
wouldn't tilt up...
to follow the ascent...
and its commands
for keeping Apollo 16...
were too slow.
Now with one last chance...
to televise the complete event...
the pressure was on
to pan and zoom the camera...
several seconds
before liftoff.
Otherwise the world
would never see...
a perfect TV picture
of Apollo leaving the moon.
Engine arm is ascent.
- I'm going to get the pro.
- Roger.
Ninety-nine...
proceed.
Three...
two, one.
Ignition.
With the precision emblematic
of its near flawless mission...
Apollo 17 embarked from the moon
for the sixth and final time...
in the history of mankind.
The exploration
of another world...
was successfully
and safely completed...
thanks to the efforts
and attention of those on Earth...
who could only look on
as vicarious participants...
as the fantastic voyages came...
to a bittersweet end.
When we were back inside
the command module...
President Nixon
sent up a message...
congratulating us
on the last exploration of the moon...
in this century.
Boy, that made me mad
because we were just getting good at it.
The hardware had been proven,
was getting even better...
and yet we have not been back
to the moon since 1972.
We should've continued
right along.
The only reason we stopped
going to the moon was politics.
Sending men to the moon
is dangerous.
It's also expensive.
It's hard to do.
But we did it at the cost
of more than just money.
If you have the time,
I can list off the names...
of a couple of
hundred thousand people...
who gave of themselves
to make it happen...
along with the names of dozens of people
who gave their lives.
Understand...
that the moon is
what the Earth once was...
before the ancient craters
were erased by the wind...
and the rain
and the geologic forces.
As such, the moon
is a time machine...
that can take us back...
and tell us what our home
was once like...
what it was made out of...
and how it came to be...
that we're all living here.
I wish...
I had been living up there
on the moon...
these past 25 years...
wandering around
with my hammer and a sack...
and a thermos or two
of coffee.
I'm very glad to have been alive
when we went to the moon.
I am of the generation
that witnessed it...
that actually saw it live
on television.
And what we saw on television...
from the forbidding
and desolate surface of the moon...
was our own world...
both beautiful and troubled.
Standing on the moon,
looking up at the Earth...
you see that the promise
and potential of our world...
is as obvious
as it is magnificent.
And for the people who live
on that green and blue ball...
there is no difficulty
they cannot overcome...
no solution they cannot grasp...
no distance
that they cannot travel.
Me standing in the valley
Of Taurus-Littrow...
is proof of that.
What we learned about the moon...
is not nearly as important
as our going there.
Apollo 8.
Witnesses to the first earthrise...
in the consciousness of man.
Apollo 17.
Gene Cernan takes
that remarkable photo...
of Jack Schmitt
standing on the moon...
with the Earth
over his shoulder.
See, that's why
we went to the moon.
To take those pictures.
We didn't go there
to conquer it or claim it...
or simply beat
the Russians to it.
Sure, we wanted to find out
what the moon was made of...
to satisfy questions of science...
that have plagued us
since the dawn of man.
But more than anything else...
we went to the moon...
to see if we could make
the journey...
because if we can do that...
if we can voyage...
from the Earth to the moon...
then there's hope
for all of us...
because we can do anything.
William Bradford, speaking in 1630...
of the founding
of the Plymouth Bay colony...
said that all great
and honorable actions...
are accompanied
with great difficulty.
And both must be enterprised...
and overcome...
with answerable courage.
If this capsule history
of our progress...
teaches us anything...
it is that man...
in his quest for knowledge
and progress...
is determined
and cannot be deterred.
The exploration of space will go ahead.
Whether we join in it or not...
we need to be a part of it.
We need to lead it.
For the eyes of the world...
now look into space...
to the moon
and to the planets beyond.
Our leadership
in science and industry...
our hopes for peace and security...
our obligations to ourselves...
as well as others...
all require us to make
this effort...
to solve these mysteries...
to solve them
for the good of all men.
There is no strife,
no prejudice...
no national conflict
in outer space as yet.
Its hazards are hostile to us all.
Its conquest deserves
the best of all mankind.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon
in this decade and do the other things...
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.
Because that challenge is one
that we're willing to accept...
one we are unwilling to postpone...
and one we intend to win.
