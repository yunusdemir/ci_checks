MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON
1854, East African Coast
That's quite an arsenal
- It is for hunting.
Who will hunt here. The coast
is closed. Hostile tribes.
I am on leave from the Indian Army, Sir.
- Lieutenant Speke ...
John Hanning Speke.
- I know the name.
Your father was the Highness Sheriff of Somerset?
There is a party going inland as some kind
of survey of the Royal Geographical Society.
But it is out of my jurisdiction
Would you introduce me to its leader
- Does not seem a good idea.
Captain Richard Burton,
travel writer. He's a fool.
I'm looking for Captain Burton.
- He's in the mosque.
He can be anywhere among this bunch.
Tends to mingle ...
Please, wait ... I was told Captain Burton
might be here.
So lieutenant, you left home
at 17 and never returned.
Why?
My oldest brother administers the
family property..
If we find gold inland
you will have property yourself.
Is that why you go?
- The captain is interested by tribal practicses.
Take these lasses here?
For centuries Somali women had been circumsied,
the men believes, it keeps the wives at home,
where they belong.
Burton has single handely disproved
that theory.
And of course there's the Nile
All have guessed:
Ptolemy, Caesar, Napoleon.
The greatest river in the world.
Will it dry up?
- Where does it begin?
Every Westerner's curisoty had been met
with torture, mutilation and death.
The river is shrouded in mystery.
Who will be the first
to discover it's source?
Which of our goals
do you favour ,Speke?
To march inland,
You will need help.
I brought many guns
<i>April 21st.</i>
<i> Native legend says that, the </ i>
<i> Nile's source lies deep in the interior. </ i>
They call the place <i> Mountains of the </ i>
<i> Moon. </ i>
<i> It is ironic that I well choose to explore the unknown</ i>
<i> and bear the personal responsibility </ i>
<i> for the exploitation of my follow up. </ i>
<i> For those who control  the  river, </ i>
<i> and thus all the nations who depend upon it for it's waters. </ i>
We are moving inland tomorrow </ i>
<i> our funds and provisions remain meagre. </ i>
<i> But we have taken in a subordinate,an English Lieutenant Speke, </ i>
<i> who brings with him more guns and ammunition. </ i>
Look.
A brown eagle.
It's a fine specimen, don't you think?
This is not an expedition for sport.
More .. Put on more wood.
What is the matter?
Some strange tribesmen followed me
as I walk back to camp.
What did they look like?
- I couldn't see clearly.
Did they carry lances?
Did they have their faces painted?
- They kept their ditance.
You should understand Lieutenant that close
observation is not only a part of our duty.
In Africa it means survival.
What did I do particularly threatening
You look what you are:
A white and an intruder.
Enough.
Keep two more sentinels tonight
I heard that the tribes of this area
castrate their victims.
That's a pleasant thought
before bedtime.
Lieutenant?
- Yes?
May I come in?
How is your feet?
Splendidly callous.
But I assure you I am quite ready.
I thought you might want this.
Acacias roots,
Good for hardening the skin.
Good night, Dick.
- Good night, Jack.
Wake Up. Wake Up.
Stand! - I have no ammunition.
- Stand I say, Let us secure a retreat.
There are too many.
- Let us go to the water.
Where's Speke?
Stop here.
Exactly here.
Head on.
I will be along shortly.
Be careful with that, Tom.
I didn't want you to see me get out of the carriage
this way. My wounds will heal quite soon.
You look splendid, John.
When the wound is festering,
I think there is a whole lot of pus.'
- Perhaps, we should lance it soon.
You assured me, that this small operation
would not leave any scars.
"Then, what is this?
He's's a butcher, that's what he is.
Should be prohibited from practicing.
- Who was that?
When did you get back?
Where did this happen?
I've repaired myself. You will
proud of your old mate.
This last journey, Edward ...
Bungled.
Two friends killed
and many bearers.
One young lieutenant horribly wounded.
A good man.
- There are many good men in my profession too.
Africa is so vast.It won't be explored
in our life times.
The Nile is an obsession and I need to go back
and I want you to come with me.
Medicine is my obsession.
You know that.
If you returned with some bizarre fungus growing from
your armpit, you would have to find an another doctor.
I can't come
Sorry that I pressed you this way.
I'll sleep here.
- Sleep in the bedroom?
I'll be quite comfortable on the couch.
- What if we have guests?
I'm a Geographer ...
I navigate.
And Sir Gentlemen, We are much grateful to Captain
Burton for his activities in Africa ...
where our distinguished colleague
Dr. David Livingstone continues to work.
The resources of the Nile ..
its certain treasures ...
await discovery.
It gives me pleasure to introduce
Captain Richard Burton.
So I thank the Royal Gegoraphical Society for it's support.
If our small exercusion ended abruptly...
and I am convinced that a larger fully armed expedition
will bring us the success we so much desire.
Research is already underway
to determine the safest route.
Since no white man has ever penetrated this area
We are so much at the mercy of Arab information.
The source of the Nile and the mysteries
of Central Africa remained to be found.
Major effort now I am sure would be to the glory of
the Society and Her Majesty the Queen.
Well done, Richard.
Father, How well do you know the Speke family?
I cannot hear you.
Burton wants to finance another expedition.
- Burton will bring the Society the biggest success.
  Remember that.
Does people like him? -Surely. You should not
be resentful because his publisher is someone else.
Burton's is Irish.
- And Livingstone is a Scott.
-Entirely different matter
Dr.Livingstone is our
most esteemed Christian missionary.
You haven't met Speke, have you?
<i>Je suis la! La fête commence!</i>
One of your fans ...
- Algernon Swinburne.
I was wondering Captain Burton why you didn't return
to England after your exploit in Mecca.
You should have be knighted.
- Better to be knighted in Cairo with prostitutes.
Better to be knighted in Cairo
than to be knighted in London.
Lady Houghton...
- Richard, May I introduce you to Isabel Arundell.
Isabel, Our guest of honor,
Capitán Richard Burton.
I caution you, Richard ...
She knows a good deal about you.
I brought this volume along, in the hope
that you would inscribe it.
- Which volume?
Instructions on the use of bayonet and the sword'.
- Strange choice.
Why not one of my travel episodes?
- In theory the only book of yours my parents will permit me to keep.
My book.
- You don't want me to sign it?
I do want you to sign it.I do.
Thank you.
Done.
- Thank you.
'To innocence and virtue ".
What impertinence ...
- You were in the Royal Geographical Society.
They have their rules.
I was ejected.
Not without a struggle, I recall.
Now Burton tell us about the real Africa.
Did you kill many men?
- My Lord, Who is this dandy??
I always want wit,
elegance and beauty at my table.
And in this case ...
...replace the beauty at once.
I was wondering if you enjoyed using
your famous swords on the natives?
In Africa Sir, a sword or spear as blunt
as your wit, would be useless indeed.
Ladies and gentlemen ...
To our host, Lord Houghton.
To his eccentric tastes.
And average wine.
- Thank you.
May I recommend you some of my tailors.
You are indeed lawyer, the most direct of all politicians.
Fashion have changed a bit in the last decade.
Do I look absurd?
- In a word ... Yes
You know, My husband is very wordly.
It can be difficult at times.
If I were a man ...
I will like to be Richard Burton.
Where was this? Here?
- I found it behind those books.
Want to dance?
Thank you.
I just discovered a few things
I didn't know about you.
Tell me.
Well, You are for example
an ungainly dancer.
The man who finds the Niles source will become more famous,
more honor, than any carrer officier in the army .
It's the last great price. John will become rich
through the sale of books that my father and I will publish.
May I confine in you?
In all these years he has been
away, I have received two or maybe three letters.
He has great difficulty in writing.
And this man, Burton ...
I know my way.
"Are you all right , John?
- I have problem balancing the stone.
Let me help you.
- No.
You are amazing.
I want to ride tomorrow.
Of course, we'll go together.
Your brother carries with him that wonderful
odour of fresh farm dung.
Tell me your impression of Burton?
Those who served him, loved him.
But he often rebukes unnecessarily.
He was responsible for your wounds.
Perhaps.
But it was worth it.
Never before had I such a
sense of purpose.
You OK?.
I'm fine, Lowry.
Stop scratching. It is healing.
I tried to enlist with the nursing corp.
- For Crimea?
Florence Nightingale, she said,I am too inexperienced.
Patients have been spared
You studied hypnotism, didn't you?
- With a yogi in Rajasthan.
Does it relieve pain?
- And boredom
Try it.
Here in the botanical gardens?
- Yes you can.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
You will relax ...
Your mind will empty.
Here in the botanical gardens?
Please, father. If we make a contribution to
the Royal Geographical Society ...
They wil have to accept Speke and we will have
exclusive rights to publish his findings.
But you already suggested that he is semi illiterate.
- Your son is .....
Your son is a skilled editor.
John Hanning Speke is English.
Burton is not.
Now surely, the public prefers its own hero
from a good English family.
Is your primary interest in Speke,
Business?
Sign.
Where did you tell your parents, you will be out tonight?
- At the opera.
Which one?
- Mozart.
Don Juan.
You once wrote, that you've inspected a lover
in Cairo with a candle .
Don't remember. You made me forget
all other women.
The memories will return, I'm sure.
In the name of science ...
What is it?
I want to meet your parents.
You must prepare the way.
You must have a small amount of preparation to do,
Richard.
I suppose you hunt in Africa?
- When I need food.
I am also fond of hunting, myself.
It's a fine sport indeed. Brings out a man's.
skill and daring under perilous circumstances.
Have you ever shot a lion?
No. .. just partridges.
Yours a vagabond life.
In dusty faraway places.
I often live in tents, yes, but to observe
the native customs and ways of behaviour.
Is that the English policy?
- No, but it should be.
How many languages do you speak?
- 23.
And some Turkish dialects from Bermia.
And what of religion?
Religion, I have seen a man raised
from the dead in India.
I have kissed the holy stone in Kaba and Mecca.
I have read the Confucius, the Koran
and the Kabbalah in the orginal manuscripts.
As for my own
spiritual progress ... I'm working on it.
You take this.
Maybe gone for how long
Who knows?
It will keep you safe.
- Bye, Isabel.
Farewell, My love.
Sir,I am very much strong.
I have got good legs for walking.
No, I said no.
Not you.
Wait here.
Sir, I know languages.
Kiswahili, the Desert people
and the Mountains of the Moon.
Do you know the Mountains of the Moon?
- Yes, and my father has seen big water.
What's Jemadar got against you?
Well, he is giving me orders but he is not my Sultan.
So I make him to bite him.
So you bit the Jemadar?
- Yes, I am Sidi Bombay the soldier.
You just give me a English uniform .
I would very much go with you.
Will you help me pick good honest men?
- Very Much.
All your maps have vast land spaces.
-To the South, Burton.
Follow the ancient slave routes.
They maybe safer.
Jemadar would not be in charge of the caravan.
- Then put yourself in charge, Jack.
Yes, very well.
I've already have.
That young man is here because he
wants to return to England with sucess.
But you, I think you enjoy
the days of your life.
Make no mistake ... I mean,
to have success, as well.
In this wilderness, you will find
only Allah's terrible whims
<i> Dear Isabel, We would be the first </ i>
white me <i> to approach the interior. </ i>
<i>We were preceded by reputation </ i>
<i>as colonial slave traders.</ i>
<i> Our bearers </ i>
<i>are fearful of attack.</ i>
<i> We have been warned of the fevers and the madness </ i>
<i>that awaits us . </ i>
<i> Soon </ i>
<i> we will will cross 1000 miles in 100 days.</ i>
<i> Hopefully it won't take longer, since I neglected </ i>
<i> to bring more than one walking suit. </ i>
<i> Love, Richard. </ i>
It's a Chronometer.
.
Actually it is a highly accurate clock.
- Yes, I can see that.
In a few days topography will change.
We may lose sight of the trail.
I'll teach how to take your position.
- Yes, of course.
Here, clumsy.
Do it this way.
My God, Human flesh.
My first Lion ...
Rifle.
Don't shoot those beauties, Jack.
I'll see if I can drive them off.
Leave him.
He is a escaped slave.
I will stay here, Dick ...
just in case you fail.
He fears to go back in the direction
we travel.
But you saved him so he is
very much your servant.
Ask him about his two set of ears.
- Oh, This is magic man.
Yes, He has very much ears.
He can listen to the voices of the dead.
Nonsense.
He has not seen white man before.
Sir, Some people they are stealing.
Your servants.
-What.
Come back, Thief
Stop,I know who you are.
Return, that's mine.
It's a bit crude, but in conjunction with
the chronometer it tells the longitude.
Last night 13 bearers deserted. We lost most of
our guns and most of our food supply seems gone.
I will organize an hunting party.
What does he hears,
I want to know.
Last night he heard many voices.
He says, they speak of you.
What did they say?
They tell this man, that you
will take his heart away.
And what does he suppose that means?
He cannot say.
<i>Dear Isabel...</i>
<i>Eventhoug Mabruki has been a slave for so long</i>
<i>his mind has remained free.</i>
<i> He asked if we want to find </ i>
<i> the beginning of the river ...</ i>
<i> why not start from it's end, </ i>
<i>walk along its shores and see where it begins. </ i>
<i>I explained many tried that way and was swallowed up</ i>
<i>by the vast deserts of the Nile </ i>
<i> 'Pehraps your river </ i>
<i> He told me, is meant to be mystery. </ i>
<i> 'You should look for what </ i>
<i> it can give: A bath and a good meal. '</ i>
Wait.
Sidi, Show them the cloth.
They can give us some food, but they
want these clothes to have names.
Very Well
This is calico.
Okay.
This is pacely.
That is ... rum punch.
Sorry, Dick, you're wrong about that one.
That is not rum punch, Good sir ...
that is malt whiskey.
And that's chocolate pudding.

What is this?
Don't be offended.
It's a blessing.
It's All right
The bond has been made.
Try some?
What is it, sir?
What's wrong, Sir?
What's wrong?
- There's a beetle in my ear.
- Sidi, Get a candle.
Sidi, Hold his wrists, steady.
I'll give drops of Warburg
for the pain.
Do not let go.
Let go, it has no effect.
That damn thing
is eating my eardrum.
I killed it.
I know I've killed it,
I can't hear it anymore.
It is alright Jack,
You never listen anyway.
On that Monday, I rowed
Faraway you did row.
calm and peaceful, the sea was
in the dawn's glow.
I did not know
that cold death
Waited for me at the bottom
that sad day
Still haunts me
Wherever I go
<i> For a month after John's ear healed, </ i>
<i> Everytime John sneezed a strange squeaky sound emerged from his ear. </ i>
<i> This delighted our bearers </ i>
<i> they kept asking him to hold his nose and make that whistle sound </ i>
<i>John was not amused. </ i>
Sidi, tell them to stay away. Don't let them drink.
This water is infected. You'll kill yourselves
If I get smallpox, you must leave me behind.
- Yes, Yes, I will.
I'm glad you are so consistent.
<i>The Men </ i>
<i> are hungry and sick. </ i>
<i> We have traveled 178 days without seeing </ i>
 <i> nothing of the Lake we seek. </ i>
<i> Speke only seems happy  when he is hunting. The </ i>
<i> game is scarce and rarely edible. </ i>
<i> Men argue ...</ i>
<i> and then rarely remember why. </ i>
<i>So far we have seen </ i>
<i>only a series of poor villages. </ i>
<i> Drought and famine were all round us. </ i>
<i> Half of the bearers deserted. </ i>
<i> Most of the supplies are gone. </ i>
<i>At night men smoke cannabis and tells stories, </ i>
<i> which maybe the last spurious statement they ever utter. </ i>
<i> At times we seems to move </ i>
<i> in a dream. </ i>
<i> Memories of England </ i>
<i> seem far away. </ i>
My father's caravan came across the desert
when they reached these valleys they took slaves.
They proceed to the coast, sold their
captives, sailed home in ships
and again began the cycle.
Now we stay in the valley
with the Chief Fundikira's tribe.
Have you heard of a lake?
- They say that to the west there is water.
You must not hurry to your deaths.
You should stay.
Conversation is the soul
of life in this place.
The chief believes in talking lists.
He believes to make conversation very much
important this way.
- I understand.
The things that haunt men.
A talkative woman, a mosquito, diarrhea ...
and death in a place far from home.
-Yes, My King.
The parts of a man
a lion eats.
The buttocks, thighs ...
the flesh of the upper arm.
And then sometimes the face and tongue.
Whole life
also devours a man too.
It eats your muscles and strength.
His brain and then his restless heart.
When are we leaving?
- In time, All in good time.
We don't have any time.
What about living, Jack?
- We came to find the Nile.
I am thinking of dismantling this thing, so i can
repair it again.
Without proper instruments
We are not geographers.
What do you think
that you're discovering here, Dick?
They are praying for our journey, Jack.
I don't need it.
Will you do me a favour, pass these to
the next caravan going to the coast.
-Of course
My boots ... Get them off.
My legs are swollen.
Mabruki says he has seen this before.
A man will die in three days unless
his legs are cut.
Cut my legs, Jack.
Cut them.
Cut them.
- I can't.
Sir,You must let blood out, you must.
- Give it to me.
Sir, It is water.
It is just a small mountain lake.
-No Sir, There is plenty of water.
Lift me up. Lift me up.
John Hanning Speke.
This is the lake.
We've done it!
<i> They called the Lake Tanganyika. </ i>
<i> 'The Meeting Place of Waters'. </ i>
<i> With long boats </ i>
<i> We set out to explore the shores. </ i>
<i> Large as this lake is </ i>
<i> We couldn't determine if it is the definite source. </ i>
<i> We went to shore following streams, </ i>
<i> but they ended dry on an impenetrable marsh. </ i>
<i> Some of the men drank fetid waters, </ i>
<i> they were afflicted with dysentery,malaria and despair. </ i>
It is not here, John.
We will have to go ashore.
Say what you mean.
You had given up and going back, don't you?
For the sake of God,
these men are dying.
Row, you bastards, Row.
Come On, Row
<i> I decided we will continue overland, </ i>
<i> in search of connecting waterway. </ i>
Stay here.
I'll go and talk to them.
These men says there is a great kingdom
to the north. They have heard of the lake.
I'm tired of rumors. If there is another
lake, we'll find it ourselves.
We need supplies, food.
<i> At times I wonder why I </ i>
<i> continue, but I have no answer. </ i>
<i> I asked to myslef, why the only echo I hear is: 'Damn  </ i>
<i> fool, the devil tries you '. </ i>
He wants to leave.
- Tell him to stay, I will see no harm comes to him.
He will stay, but he is very much afraid
- Tell him I need him. Make him understand.
He has my word on this.
He understands, but he is not convinced.
Convince him and tell him not to follow me.
John, I need your help.
What is it?
- I can't pull down my pants,
and I have to shit.
We come as friends, Of the great island
overlooking the Northern Sea. We are friends.
This man is Veldu, Minister of Lord Ngola.
From over there till here, all this is their kingdom.
Veldu recites their laws.
No one can enter the kingdom
without splendid dress.
No one will sit
above their Lord Ngola.
No one can come without gifts.
Does the white men see Lord Ngola?
- Yes, We see him.
Does you truly see him?
- We see the king of Paradise and Mountains and Wind.
We were told to bring great gifts and we brought them.
These are the things he has stolen..
Your Minister, He is a thief.
He says to kill these men and take their
possesions and sell them to caravan as slaves.
Tell him, that we are Kings too.
From the great Island of the Far sea.
He says that you are not King.
This is a special gift for the king.
- He says, sit down.
Stand back.
Sidi,Tell him it's a weapon,
a dangerous weapon.
Don't.
What do you make of this?
Not bad, is it?
We are not his guests, Jack.
We are his prisoners.
The king's sister, Lema,
she is very much sick.
She says she needs a beautiful
white doctor man..
She says her husband died.
She have very much strong desire
and very much lonely heart.
Yes, I am sure.
They say he was a prisoner
who ran away. Once he had power here.
He offended Veldu
and they made him slave.
They won't free him or sell him to us
at any price?
He says that you are no King.
He wants to shame you.
He wants you to beg.
Your touch make her feel much better..
so you come every day.
Tell her, Yes. And I want permission to leave and
I want permission to look for the lake.
When she is better, she says, Yes.
The beautiful white doctor, He can go.
Tell her I care for her
with all my heart.
<i> Speke has permission to leave  </ i>
<i> with a handful of bearers for a short expedition. </ i>
<i> To ensure his return, </ i>
<i> They are keeping me here. </ i>
I fear for <i> Mabruki, </ i>
<i> I sworned that no harm would come to him. </ i>
<i> Can I ever believe in myself again </ i>
<i> if I fail to keep that promise? </ i>
They have confiscated everything,
but this last thermometer.
Keep it safe.
Remember, the lower the
volume point, the higher the altitude.
Yes, I know.
I'll better be off.
Heal your legs.
Find it, Jack.
You know, Dick?
I'm still quite deaf in this ear.
I want Mabruki to be freed.
I want him to be freed.
Sidi, You're hurt,
- No Sir, I am able to go.
I can travel fast without you.
I think you should camp down here.
But Sir, I've come so far for this.
- My mind is made up.
I will return in a few days.
- Ali, Juma. Stay here.
The rest of you come with me.
Rest.
Who are you?
You look drugged.
And this man says he is a King.
Look at him.
They've drugged me.
The Royal Geographical Society.
This man is free. I freed him.
- A King does not care about Slaves.
Look.
Take this sword.
Use it.
For God's sake.
He's my friend.
Lord, he is crying.
Is crying fit for a King?
This is a cruel and sadistic kingdom.
This is a vicious place.
You hear me.
You're a little people.
You will pass away.
You deserve to be forgotten.
A good King treats his people kindly.
Slavery must end.
God help me.
Now he is free.
Now he is free.
Kill him.
Make slaves of his friends.
Yes, I will say your name in my country.
I found it.
I found the source.
Are you all right?
Listen to me, Dick. Please
We have achieved our goal.
We have permission to leave here.
- Permission to leave?
What did you do?
- Ngola is rewarding me for having great powers.
Oh! good, then come with me.
I'll show you the lake.
Mabruki is dead.
Richard, But we have the Nile,
I know I found it.
The monsoon is coming. We
must go back to the coast immediately.
Hear me, I know it is the Nile's source.
- You saw the river flowing out of the lake?
No, I didn't see it's actual affluent,
but I know such a river is there.
- How do you know, Jack?
I took two accurate readings.
It is a much higher lake than Tanganyika.
Did you go round it?
- No, it's too vast.
"So you didn't circle the lake, you speak none of
the languages there, you saw no river, yet you know.. "
This is the Nile, you can see for yourselves,
Come with me. You can estimate the altitude.
- Estimate.
I'm afraid I broke our last thermometer.
- Then we have no instruments, None.
What do we do then?
Guess?
If you have seen it, you'd know I'm right.
- Jack, We won't talk about it now.
You saw a body of water
you know nothing about.
I thought to name it Lake Victoria.
 <i> Dear Isabel </ i>
<i> The last thing I saw was an African city, </ i>

<i> The Chief Minister, now dead, </ i>

Everything is prepared.
Richard, You must tell me
what happened here.

"Lowry?
My God. John?
Dumb speechless.
- Impossible.
When did you get back?
- I have only just arrived.
I brought you my journals.
I have some great news.
Murchison thinks that you should address
the Royal Geographical immediately.
It is called for a assembly tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.
Without Burton?
- Please, It's the President's wish.
What is th matter?
It is just so all unexpected.
And Richard will be back soon,
I'm sure.
Well if you'll excuse me, there is
much to do for you.
Let me ask you, Jack.
When you first met Burton
and the two of you were attacked and wounded ...
- Yes
Did you ever read his official report to the army, afterwards?
- His report? No, never saw it.
It happens, I've read it.
He makes no menition of you.
Except to say you were an inexperienced officer
who acted somewhat in a cowardly manner while under atack.
He couldn't have written that.
- But he did.
You will not see that report, nor neither
will anyone else. I've had it destroyed.
I saved his life.
- Of course, You did.
If he slandered you once, he
will do it again. Especially
now when the stake is so high
They're expecting me.
Receive tomorrow, what you so well
deserve.
Come to my house and rest. We still
have time to prepare a rebuttal.
You know me better than that,
won't go about arguing for a career.
Not talking about the minor poltics of once career.
Two weeks ago, Speke commited an act of treachery.
Have you send for Isabel?
- I resent the impact
of fully funded expedition
and he is in charge.
He is ambitious and weak.
- Weak? You don't know.
He allows Oliphant and Murchison to
ridicule you. He's deadly in his weakness
He saved my life, many times.
- Then go and talk to him.
No, I can't, he must come to me.
- Would not be sure of that.
He leaves for Africa
in two weeks.
Isabel.
Father, A grand ceremony Father.
- Thank you.
Isabel, Allow me to present my good friend, Lord
Russel of the foreign office.
- How do you do.
Much, He has the most charming chapel
as house, my dear.
I did not know, that Lord Russel
knew my son-in-law.
- Oh, Yes indeed.
Undoubtedly, You were aware that Richard is an expert
in Arab affairs.
I thought I knew everything about your
husband, until your wedding, I have no idea
about the depths of his good taste.
Should he not be thought of
for a major consulate?
<i> I am convinced that the Nile's source </ i>

Two years later
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, Thank you.
Silly, but wonderful.
Oh! London just seemed so lively..
I don't know when I enjoyed it so much.
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
would you please welcome ...
a surprise guest.
The real conqueror of the River Nile
Mr. John Hanning Speke.
Is this your idea, Lowry?
- Go ahead, John. Take the stage.
Later there will be an interview.
I do not know what to say.
You all seem so barbaric compared
to the Africans.
I am not very talented at this.
I do not know how exactly to thank you.
Expect to say Thank you.
- Tell us something about the lake.
- Don't, Don't speak Speke. Sing.
There was a time when we were
in the stretch of desert.
Several of the bearers had already
died of thirst.
My second in command had cuts
and wounds all over his body.
Asked if he look bad.
How bad?
I knew he was hurt,
but I was blind, you see ...
and so I couldn't answer him.
So I sang.
And even then,
in the hot desert sun ...
in that bleak and hopeless landscape...
All I could think of:
'Was My God, I might have tuned'.
So, if you will help me ...
Newspapers ...
Speke Again.
I don't care.
That is more than apparent.
Richard, You must get out of here.
You must get out of England.
An expedition requires money.
Excuses.
You are paralyzed in Self-pity .
All right, Then borrow money from your family.
- You know that's impossible.
Then ask your blessed church.
Tell them I will be a humble missionary.
Do not speak against my church
and I won't speak against your brandy.
For hundreds, maybe thousands of years
Africans fished this lake.
They have washed their clothes.
They pissed on it.
An aryan white man claim to have discoverd,
which Africans have discovered.
I won't argue about a patch of land
and whereabout of a river.
- You can take a consular position.
They haven't asked me.
- I went to see Lord Russel.
I specifically told you not to speak to anyone
at the foreign office.
There is a consulate open, In Brazil.
- In South America?
My qualifications are for Africa, Arabic countries.
- But if you speak Portugese,
   You are qualified for anywhere in the world.
You go and beg before politicians.
That is despicable.
Then fight. Fight for it. Fight for your name,
Fight for your honor. If you don't, then I must.
Be careful with that thing.
You don't know how to use it.
Then teach me.
If I am given some grumpy little consulate
on the wrong side of the world ...
You think I take you with me?
You take me.
You would die without me.
I'd die without you.
Dr. Livingstone, May I present my
good friend, Richard Francis Burton.
I have just finished your book.
I wonder if you gentlemen would leave us
alone for a few minutes?
There is much to discuss.
We will wait in the conference room.
Got that in Africa, did you?
Tribes men, they lanced at my face.
Split my palate, knocked out some
teeth and came out over here.
Very Risky profession.
- Indeed.
You know of course that I was mauled by a Lion?
Who, if he haven't just fed, would have eaten all of me.
And it was, he only chewed my shoulder.
Bullet hole. Single bore.
And what about that?
Sat on a scorpion.
Quashed him dead...
but his sting put this hole in my ass,
nearly killed me.
Gangrene. Swells the leg.
I had to cut it myself.
Had some brandy that day.
Rat bite.
And that one?
Nice and nasty.
Yes,But you know?
I can't think of another life.
Do you miss Africa?
- I do.
I must say, Burton looks very well.
And there are some interesting points of his account.
- Burton's evidence is hardly conclusive.
You should have send him back but instead you send Speke.
And once again he didn't travelled round the lake.
And what is keeping them for so long?
In one stretch Speke has the Nile
flowing uphill for 90 miles.
John tells me all inconsistencies will be
cleared up in his published account.
An account published for profit by
the Oliphants.
He's a good guy, Burton.
I like his mettle.
But who is the most reliable?
Surely, Speke.
How about a debate?
- Very appealing, Two heroes on one platform.
Now we can be assured, that every major scientists
will attend our next meeting.
We could invite the Newspapers,
The Public.
Will Burton accept?
- I don't know, he suffered great
  insults in your hands
Perhaps, it would all be too technical.
Who would judge?
- I will.
These are the maps wanted, and I managed to locate some
materials from yours and Burton's orginal expedition.
Is this the Burton's report to the army?
- Yes, One he wrote after you both were wounded.
I thought this was destroyed.
Why was I not given this before?
I didn't thing this was relevant.
- Burton was capable of using this.
I asked to see everything
so I could be prepared.
Is there any difficulty here?
- Burton's old report, have you read it?
Yes, I remember clearly well reading it.
And it deal mainly with finances.
Did it discuss the battle?
Only so far as, Burton took the responsibility
for not been adequately prepared.
Nothing about me?
As I recall, he gave you credit
for saving his life.
But surely, You knew all about this?
Yes, I am simply trying to be fair.
John, John, the turnout for tomorrow is amazing
journalists coming from all over the country.
You lied to me Lowry.
I always lie
my way to the truth.
What today is not more
than a formality.
The real debate
will be tomorrow.
Shall we?
Hello Jack ...
Burton...
Sir, Master Speke, must I have to come inside
with all these tomcats?
No, It is a lovely day.
Wait in the carriage.
We'll go hunting.
I would like to welcome the many learned and esteemed
scientists, I see in our audience today.
We are privileged, Indeed to have you as our guest.
I am sure you all agree
that the discovery of the source of the Nile ..
is the most exciting event for Geographers
since Columbus discovered America.
Later today Captain Richard Burton will speak to the society on matters
not directly related to the forth coming debate.
And tomorrow we will commence with
Captain Burton's formal paper ...
to be followed after a short break
by one from John Hanning Speke.
I've put in my appearance.
My family excepts me.
- Of course, see you tomorrow.
One note of apology, it is warm in here.
Pehraps by next year one of you scientist ...
would direct your researches on
the neglected study of ventilation.
John?
I feel I can call you, John?
- Of course.
I know who you are.
Surprising isn't it, that
we have never met?
Yes.
Excuse me Madame,
My carriage is just outside.
Do you really want this debate?
- Why not? - It is the last thing Richard wants.
- Yes
I suppose he dreads the outcome.
No. He knows ...
that you are incapable of assembling the proofs
of your argument and that you lose.
Sorry,
but I can't discuss it.
No one, not even myself know
what you went through together.
These people in there, they don't no know and they don't care,
they need you as adversaries. But Richard doesn't
Then why is he here?
- He would cancel tomorrow.
He knows no truth will emerge
in the absence of truth and
he respects only one thing
He respects Loyalty.
John, He respects you.
Trouble with those people is,
they got morals no more.
They are a bunch of idlers.
I'm glad that you have resolved
your problem, Sir.
I heard an English man say this
'The black man is indolent,
lazy by nature. "
'He drinks his beer at sunrise
and sleeps all day.' Well perhaps.
It can be 120 degrees at the Equator.
That man is consumed with the same daily acts.
Let us say gathering food, gathering wood.
He does it with primitive tools
until the sun sets.
And then he dances ...
he tells stories.
'What is he accomplished? '
Asks the English Man.
What does English man accomplishes
if he mine coal whole day ...
sips his beer at night
and then scums to fatigue?
Failing to make love
and then forgets how..
If my travels and if my books
have any meaning ...
If Geography itself
has any significance ...
It is that we are made to lift our eyes
from our own small provincial selfs ...
to the whole complex and
magnificent world.
Excellent.
The question today is a serious question
I maintain that question remained unanswered.
Science demands meticulous readings
Exhaustive enquiry.
Which of these lakes is the true source of the Nile?
I maintain that the evidence we have is still incomplete.
My opponents maps are at best
vague sometimes insufficient.
It is even possible that the lakes interconnect.
This should be evaluated after the monsoon.
John Hanning Speke...
was killed yesterday afternoon
in a hunting accident.
I would like to suggest. I would ask...
Mr. Burton to
continue with his lecture.
Which lake is the source?
Or is it a series of lakes?
My conclusion draw me
to the latter.
the evidence of which is gathered by
myself ...
and John Hanning Speke ...
on our initial expedition.
John went back.
Jack...
returned.
What do you think so?
Was it an accident or suicide?
Please make a statement, sir.
He's very upset.He needs to rest
Mr. Oliphant, you are his personal friend.
Would you make a statement?
What will you do now?
You have killed him Burton. You are a fool.
You're life is over,you will never return to Africa.
Now you can become a bureaucrat.
They will write 'murder'. I'll see to that
It is not what they write,
Oliphant.
It is never what they write.
He's dead too.
Madame, Can I speak to your husband?
- I am sorry, he's packing, We're leaving for Brazil.
"On holiday?
- No, he will serve as a Consul there.
- It is allright, Isabel.
Edgar Papworth, I am a sculptor.
I 've been commisioned to
I've seen your work.
- Oh! Really?
You see I have no time, to pose for a bust
would be impossible.
It is not that. I have been commisioned
by the Speke family
I haven't been asked my price,
but it happens sometimes.
I just made a copy of
his death mask.
I  never saw the man in life. And it well
happens in death, well, some distortions.
Naturally the
eyes were closed.
You knew him intimately. So would you
make any suggestion? The clay is still soft.
Excuse me, My husband and Mr Speke
have not seen each other for many years ...
until recently,
and then only for a moment.
No, It isn't right.
There is too much here.
I see, It wasn't strong enough.
The cheekbones, mouth ...
Yes, That's better.
So, That is how he look like?
Yes, That's him.
It's Speke.
Thank you.
I am, wouldn't have intruded.
I thought they weren't that close, Newspapers.
They were friends.
Richard, are you ready?
Of couse, I am.
ISABEL and Burton was married for 30 years.
One never saw them apart in public.
David Livingstone died during an expedition,
while searching for the Nile's sources.
John Hanning Speke was right. Lake Victoria was
indeed the source of the Nile, which was established, 12 years
after his death.
