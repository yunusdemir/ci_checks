Daddy! Daddy!
Me and wicket
are going back to the village now!
Tell your mother
l got the main unit repaired!
It shouldn't be long now.
- Cindel leave soon?
- I guess so.
The star cruiser's almost fixed.
We're gonna have to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
That's what you say
when your friends go away.
"Goodbye" not good.
I don't wanna leave here, wicket...
but we can finally go home.
- Home?
- It's where we live. It's far away.
Why go?
For one thing,
my brother and I could go to school.
School?
It's where you go to learn things.
Cindel learn here with wicket.
No, silly.
I have to learn grown-up things.
Mmm! Wicket go to school.
Yes! You could come with us!
No. Ewok live here.
Wicket family here.
Don't worry. I won't be gone forever.
I'll come back and visit you
as soon as I can.
Yes, yes!
Cindel come back, visit wicket.
Come!
- What's wrong?
- Shh.
Danger.
Oh!
Cindel stay.
- Mommy.
<i>Mace! Mace!</i>
Get back, Cindel!
- Mommy!
- Stay away!
Get help! Get Dad!
Daddy! Daddy!
My lord Terak wants what you
have concealed from him.
<i>He will get what he desires.</i>
- Wait a minute.
I want the power.
You will give it to me now.
I don't... I haven't got anything
that's valuable here.
<i>We're... We're strangers here. We just...</i>
Is this not the hidden ship?
Are you not the guardian of the power?
I don't know what you're talking about.
- No, please don't. No, please...
The power. I have the power!
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Mm-hmm.
Mommy, Mace, they're dead.
I know, honey. I know.
- I'm scared.
- So am I.
But we have to be strong now.
Do you understand that?
Do you remember the story
l used to tell you...
about the little bird...
that got blown out of his nest
during a storm?
He had to fly for the first time, didn't he?
That's right. He flew and he flew...
and, finally, after the storm,
he found his way home.
Now, honey, I want you to find Deej.
The Ewoks will help you.
- No, Daddy. I want to stay with you.
- No, sweetheart.
You can't do that.
You have to go on without me.
You have to be like that little bird
and fly away.
- I won't.
- Now, listen, Cindel, you will.
Now, you do as I say.
When I say go, you run.
Okay?
Cindel, I'll always be with you.
I'll always be with you.
I love you.
Don't look back. Just run fast. Run!
There's no escape for you, my little one.
You are a pretty prize.
- Oh, wicket. It's you!
- Cindel!
My family... they're all dead.
What happens to me now, wicket?
I'm all alone.
Wicket take care of Cindel.
My family.
Wicket Cindel's family now.
- Ewoks family now.
Cindel live. Wicket live.
Must have hope.
Must escape.
- Shh, shh, shh!
What did he say?
Hole too small. Ewok too big.
I can fit. And he could fit.
I know he could.
Wicket fit.
Cindel, hurry.
One, two, three.
- Go!
- Oh!
Ohhh!
We go!
Hurry, Cindel!
Whoa! Ohhh! Oh!
Cindel, in here!
Oh!
Safe now.
But we're trapped!
Find way out.
Look.
Back. Back, Cindel.
Oh, no!
We can't get down this way.
Trouble. Big trouble.
Hmm. Mm!
Aha!
Hmm. Hmm.
Ah!
Oh! Mmm. Hmm.
<i>Oh!</i>
Cindel, help! Help, Cindel!
Wicket!
Ohhh!
Run, wicket! Run!
Hyah! Oh!
- Oh, no!
- <i>Cindel!</i>
<i>Cindel! Cindel!</i>
Cindel!
Wicket! Wicket!
Ohhh!
Help! Help!
- Oh!
- Cindel, I coming!
Whoaaa!
Oh! Cindel!
<i>Hold on! Hold on!</i>
Whoa-oh-oh-ohhh!
Oh!
Come!
Cindel safe now.
- Look. Go. Hide here.
Ahhh.
- What's that?
- Trouble.
- Huh?
Got you.
- Nooo!
He could help us.
Him help? Humph.
Maybe he knows where we can find food.
Food, food, food.
I think he understands.
<i>We're hungry.</i>
<i>Could you help us find some food?</i>
- Let's go.
Over there!
- Over there!
- Okay.
Mmm.
What that?
<i>l think it's a house.</i>
Ahhh.
Careful.
If somebody does live in here,
they sure are messy.
Yep, yep. Messy.
What this? So much junk.
Hmm. Huh.
Ohhh.
I guess the people moved away
and left all this junk behind.
Wicket! Wicket!
- Hmm?
- If nobody lives here any more...
we can clean up
and this could be our house.
Yes, yes, Cindel. Our house.
Uh-oh.
- How'd you get here?
- He brought us here.
- He did, uh-huh.
- <i>You nasty little bug-lover!</i>
I've told you and I've told you. I don't
want no strangers around this place!
<i>You brought 'em here</i>
<i>and you don't even know who they are!</i>
- Who are you?
- My name is Cindel.
- Yeah? Well, who's that?
- Wicket.
Humph. Wicket.
Oh. You've been messing with my stuff.
All right. You brought 'em here.
Now you get 'em out of here.
- I don't want you here! Get out!
No place to go.
I don't care about that.
Now, you take him and go! Go on!
Come on, wicket.
He doesn't want us here.
He's just a mean old man, anyway.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Skedaddle!
I'll deal with you in a minute!
What do we do now, wicket?
Night soon. Rest here.
Safe.
Strangers.
Teek, you oughta know better!
<i>This is my house, these are my things.</i>
Don't want no strangers around here.
<i>Besides, if I did let 'em stay...</i>
First thing you know,
they'd wanna be friends or something.
- And then look at the trouble we'd have!
I'm cold, wicket.
Mm. Cold.
I'm hungry too.
Wicket hungry too.
You don't know who those people are
and you don't know what they're up to.
And it could be some kind of trick!
<i>l know you get lonesome.</i>
<i>You think I don't?</i>
<i>What's this?</i>
<i>Now, what do we got here?</i>
Some kind of porridge.
You make this?
- Oh, look here.
<i>Some kind of...</i>
Some kind of little muffins.
<i>Shall we have some?</i>
All right.
<i>Ahhh!</i>
My golly. That looks good.
Dig in.
Take all you want...
but don't let me catch you
giving none of them muffins...
to them little beggars outside,
you hear me?
I'm going over to that stove
and get me some more soup.
<i>Whatever you do...</i>
You stay right where you are.
Mmm.
- Thank you.
Mmm.
You are hungry.
Mm-hmm!
Aieee! Aieee!
- Oh! Help, Cindel! Help!
<i>Thank you for building the fire.</i>
I'm so glad you're here.
Yeah.
You know what?
You're my best friend.
Mm. Yes. Best friend.
All right, what are you two little wood rats
trying to do, burn down the whole forest?
But I was cold.
I ain't gonna let you build one of these fires
unless you build it in the fireplace.
Proper place for a fire is the fireplace...
so you can have this fire tonight...
but tomorrow you gotta go,
you understand me?
What's your name?
Noa.
Goodnight, Noa.
<i>Goodnight.</i>
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Goodnight, Teek.
Now, get to bed.
Help, Noa! Help! Help!
Wicket!
<i>Wicket! They're here!</i>
- What's the matter?
- They're gonna get me. They're here!
- Who's here? What's going on over here?
- The bad men!
Ohhh. You've been dreaming, honey.
You've had a bad dream is what you've had.
Now, there's nobody gonna bother you.
Old Noa will look after you.
You're safe here now.
I'll put you in this soft bed,
cover you up...
<i>and you can sleep the night there, okay?</i>
- All right. You too. Come on.
- Me too?
Up you go.
- You'll be all right.
- Thank you.
- See what you done now?
<i>Look what we're into.</i>
We got a lot better things to do, you know,
than look after these little bounders.
- <i>Somebody somewhere</i>
<i>is worrying about 'em.</i>
And come daylight...
they're gonna have to go.
Oh. Morning.
All right. I think now it's time for you two
to run along home.
I know there's somebody
worrying about you.
- Good morning.
- We go?
- Where will we go?
- Family need wicket.
But we don't know
where they are.
We find!
Mm.
I really think it would be better
if we left them out of this.
I mean, this is a strange power.
It's... It's different.
It <i>is</i> the power I've searched for.
Surely.
This is the power the star traveller spoke of.
Yes. We have only to learn its secrets.
I have waited long enough.
You will discover its magic...
or die.
Ohhh.
If only you hadn't let that child escape.
She must know its secrets.
How dare you suggest that I am to blame.
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
- I didn't mean that, uh...
- Find the little one...
and I might forgive such insolence.
But how can I?
Find me that child!
Find me that child!
<i>Find me that child!</i>
Where you hiding, you little rug rats?
Come down here!
<i>Come on. I got something for you.</i>
<i>Oh, hiya, Teek.</i>
They gone, huh?
Well, good riddance.
I didn't want 'em here anyway. They
would've brought us nothing but trouble.
You understand? Trouble.
<i>Eating all the food in the house.</i>
<i>Messing things up.</i>
Better off without 'em.
Shh. I thought maybe you needed a new
bed, and I forgot how big you were...
so I made two of them...
one that size and one that size.
- <i>See which one suits you.</i>
It's a good thing they were gone
when I come home!
I would a throwed 'em out on their ear.
<i>Noa! Noa!</i>
Look what we've been picking.
We can make a pie.
Well, don't make a mess, you hear me?
And you either!
- Okay?
- Okay.
<i>Okay then.</i>
- Mmm!
Night-night, Teek.
<i>Teek! Stay outta those pies</i>
<i>and save some for tomorrow!</i>
Mm. Ohhh. Tired.
Those were awful good pies, Cindel.
Best I ever had.
- One for you.
- Oh. Thank you.
Thanks, Noa, for letting us stay.
Yep.
- Goodnight, Noa.
- Goodnight now.
All right now.
If you're gonna stay here with me...
you're gonna make yourselves useful.
You're gonna wash the dishes
and make the beds and clean the house...
and it's gonna be spotless when I get home.
- And, Teek, see they do it.
I wonder where he goes every day.
- <i>l guess, but where?</i>
- I dunno.
- Let's follow him and see.
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.
No, no, no, no.
Make bed. Dishes.
W we’ll do those, but later.
Okay.
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.
Oh. Look what it is.
- Big bush!
- I mean under it.
I dunno.
Let's go look closer.
Oh. Cindel, Cindel. Look.
Bush... Bush has window.
Wicket, it's a star cruiser.
Star cruiser? Star cruiser...
Star cruiser crash!
Star cruiser whoosh!
Star cruiser crash, crash!
Star cruiser... Oh!
<i>Oh! What are you two kids doing here?</i>
You shouldn't come around here!
It's dangerous!
- Wicket sorry.
- You could get hurt!
Nobody comes here, not even Teek!
- <i>Help!</i>
- And I got worse traps than this
around here!
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be sorry now.
- You all right?
- All right.
- <i>Awww, come here!</i>
All right. I'm sorry.
But you shouldn't have been here.
And you neither!
Let's get this rope off your foot.
Hold still!
How'd you get here?
A long time ago.
My friend Salak and I.
<i>We were a couple of young fellas</i>
<i>out to tear up the galaxy.</i>
Ha. On our first mission, we crashed... here.
I've been here ever since.
I don't even know how long I've been here.
- Where's your friend?
- I don't know.
See, when we crashed,
the crystal in our power drive shattered...
and he went off in search of another one.
- I stayed here.
- Ahhh.
And I've been here ever since.
My friend, Salak, he's not coming back.
I know that now.
I guess I've known it a long, long time.
So we'll stay here.
Oh! Ow!
Do you think Salak is dead?
I think so. By now he must be.
My family is too.
Makes me feel sad.
- <i>You miss 'em?</i>
- <i>Mm-hmm. I miss 'em a lot.</i>
They're not gone, you know?
They're right here in your heart.
Did you know that?
- Can you remember the last thing
your father said to you?
- Mm-hmm.
- What?
- "I'll always be with you. "
<i>See what I mean?</i>
<i>And if you remember that...</i>
And if you remember
all the things he said to you...
and if you remember
how much he loved you...
then he'll never be gone.
- But it hurts.
- So you think about the happy things.
<i>Now, tell me about your mother.</i>
What do you remember about her
that makes you happy?
She used to sing me a song.
- Do you remember the song?
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, sing it to me.
- Sing!
# My star keeps me company #
# And leads me through the night #
# My star watches over me #
# And fills my dreams with light #
# Some things change #
# But some things shine
forever as they are #
# In the sky shining high #
# My star ##
Oh, my, what a song. That's beautiful.
Mmmmm.
<i>Cindel!</i>
<i>Cindel!</i>
<i>Cindel!</i>
Mommy?
Huh?
Cindel?
Cindel?
Cindel!
Cindel!
Cindel gone! Noa! Noa!
Wake! Wake, Noa! Help!
- Noa! Wake!
Water crash.
Aaah! What's going on here?
- <i>What's the matter? What is it?</i>
- <i>Cindel gone.</i>
- What are you talking about,
you little beggar?
- Noa! Help! Cindel gone.
Cindel gone!
Danger, Noa. Danger.
<i>Cindel!</i>
Over there. Come on!
<i>#My star keeps me company #
<i># And leads me through the night #
<i># My star watches over me #
<i># And fills my dreams with light #
- <i># Some things change #
- Come on.
- Up you go. W we’ll find her.
- <i># And some things shine</i>
<i>forever as they are #
<i># In the sky shining high #
<i># My star ##</i>
Hello. I've been waiting for you.
That song.
Do you like that song?
I've always liked it.
How did you know it?
I know many things.
Well, I can't hear it any more.
- I don't know which way to go.
This way. This way.
Come to me, my little one.
Will you hand me my robe?
I told you there was no escape.
<i>Help! Help!</i>
You go upstairs now and get my rope.
Got it.
Hurry!
So, my little princess...
has come to help Terak
learn the ways of the power.
What have you done with the Ewoks?
- Ewoks?
- My friends, where are they?
Ahhh. The Ewoks. Of course.
Your friends.
They are my friends too.
They are here at my castle...
as my... my guests...
my most honoured guests.
You better not have hurt them.
Ohhh. I won't hurt them.
Not if...
<i>you make this work.</i>
What do you mean?
Use your magic.
I don't know anything about magic.
All I want is the power.
Make it work!
I can't!
Don't be foolish. Do what he says.
I can't! I can't!
I will give you until dawn.
If you have not done
as I have commanded...
you and your friends will be doomed.
<i>And you will follow her in her fate.</i>
You are my lord.
No. No tricks.
Take them away!
Let go of me!
Put me down!
- Slow down, Teek.
- Teek!
Ouch!
Teek, now I told you to slow down.
<i>We're getting close now.</i>
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>
Mm? Look!
Couldn't you wave your hands over it
or something?
Or is it a special word?
I don't know what you're talking about.
The power.
You must know how to unlock the power.
This isn't good for anything.
You just have to plug it into something.
You're lying. He told us about this.
<i>He told us it was the key to all his power.</i>
Power greater than mine,
greater than Terak's.
But it's just a piece of the star cruiser.
That's right. The power of the stars.
That's what Salak
was searching for long ago.
Salak? Noa's friend?
Yes, Salak.
<i>Salak.</i>
<i>Terak killed Salak for the power then.</i>
He'll kill you and me for it now.
<i>You're crazy.</i>
<i>Salak just wanted</i>
<i>to get away from here...</i>
Just like me and my family.
We just wanted to go home.
It's another ship.
Noa, look.
Oh, my goodness.
Will you look at that moat now?
Water black as ink.
Wicket swim.
Oh, no, you don't swim.
Here. Take a look at this.
Oh! Ohhh!
You see that?
That could've been you, you little beggar.
Ah. Okay, Teek, grab a hold.
Now, off you go.
All right. Your turn.
Ready?
Back up and get a runnin' start.
- Ready.
- Go!
Ohhh!
<i>Get your feet out of the water!</i>
Noa, pull! Help wicket! Help!
Pull! Pull! Pull! Whoa!
Whoa-ho!
Oh! Ow!
Okay.
Hurry, Teek.
Come on! Come on!
- Aaah!
- Whoa!
- Hey! Hey!
Cindel, Ewoks through door.
- What door?
- <i>That door. Cross room.</i>
- Now how are we
supposed to get over there?
What do you got there?
<i>Get your foot outta my eye.</i>
This way!
Hang on, Teek. Stay close.
- All right now, Teek.
You gotta get them keys.
Be careful. Now go on.
- Teek!
Ahhh.
Huh?
Huh?
- Wicket! Noa!
No worries. I'll get us out of here.
Hey. Hey, you!
Let me out.
No. Not her. She's evil!
Follow wicket. We escape.
- Must go. Hurry.
- Shh!
<i>Be careful.</i>
Hey!
This way. This way. Hurry.
- Deej! Deej! Quick.
- Huh?
What are we gonna do, Noa?
There's no way out.
No door, huh?
Well, I'll make us a door.
Now get back, everybody.
Quick. Duck down.
By golly, it's morning already.
Get out of the way.
What do you know?
I caught it on the first try.
All right, now. Hang on tight.
Whoa!
Whoa! Oh!
- Ow!
Okay. You're next. You too.
<i>I'm sorry about your friend Salak.</i>
- Salak?
- They killed him for the power thing.
<i>What power thing?</i>
No! No! It's mine.
- Let's get outta here.
Hold on. Here we go!
Oh!
Run, you little bug-lovers. Run!
No. No, Terak. I can help you.
There's another ship.
I can find it.
- <i>Ha, ha!</i>
- No! No!
- Let's go now.
Come on. Keep up.
- Come on. Hurry along.
Okay. Now all you gotta do is hold 'em off
till I get the power going.
<i>Understand me? If you can buy me</i>
<i>some time, we just might have a chance.</i>
Cindel, you and a couple of your friends,
come with me, okay?
Mm-hmm.
- And, wicket,
you're in charge of the others.
- Yes! We fight!
I got a catapult in the trees.
So, now, go to it!
- Cross your fingers now.
Okay now.
Let's power up this old tin can.
Aw, come on.
- What if it doesn't work?
- Then we're really in trouble.
Come on.
Light up, you worn-out tin can.
Power modulator, generator,
oscillator on. Huh.
- Okay, Cindel. Turn on the red one.
<i>No! No, the other one.</i>
Huh? Oh!
Noa, here they come!
- Uh!
Look out. They're here.
- Noa!
Come on. Come on!
Oh, no.
They're coming on the other side.
All right. Now!
You two, take the other one.
Aha!
You'll not come around botherin' me!
Take that, you big tall lummox.
- Wicket!
Oh! Aaah!
Wicket!
- Whoa!
- Wicket!
- Oh!
Huh?
Aieee!
No!
<i>Cindel! Please help!</i>
- <i>Wicket, are you hurt?</i>
- Not hurt.
- <i>They're all running away.</i>
Everything's okay now.
You, Ewok! Get Noa!
Tell the old man he has a choice.
He gives me the power or we will take her.
Go! Tell him now!
<i>Old man, I have your child...</i>
And you have something of mine.
- I am waiting, old man.
- You let her go!
Give me the power and I won't harm her.
Defy me and she is doomed.
All right, then.
If she dies, you get nothing.
You turn her loose and I'll fight you for it.
Go!
- Get her out of here, would ya?
- Hurry, Cindel.
Aaah! Ow!
Do something, wicket. Do something!
- Noa! Noa!
- Say, now. You come back from there.
- Noa.
- Will you look at that?
You, sir.
I'm proud to know ya,
and my life is better for it.
- Noa.
- Brave and fine little warrior.
Oh.
- Bye.
- And all the rest of ya too.
Bye, Noa.
- <i>And now you.</i>
What do I say to you, my friend?
You're a sweet spirit.
I love ya and I'm gonna miss ya.
Oh, wicket. You're my very best friend.
- Best friend. Best friend.
- I'm gonna miss you.
I'll come back and visit you as soon as I can.
- Please come back.
- I'll come back and visit you both.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.
- "Goodbye" not good.
<i>Come on, Cindel. It's time we go.</i>
- Off you go. So long. Bye, Teek.
<i>Teeha, </i> Cindel. Bye. Bye.
<i>Teeha, </i> Cindel. <i>Teeha, </i> Cindel.
Bye. <i>Teeha, </i> Cindel.
<i>Teeha. Teeha, </i> Cindel.
