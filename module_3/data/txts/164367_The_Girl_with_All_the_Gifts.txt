Transfer! Up!
Wake up! Move!
Reassignment. Come on.
Up, up, cursed abortions.
Transfer! Wake up!
Reassignment.
Come on, cursed abortions.
Good morning, Private Gallagher.
Good morning, Private Devani.
The head is secured.
Limbs secured.
"Handcuffs and belts
to be checked manually. "
Beautiful, pikfjćs. She knows
the rules better than you do.
Good morning, Sergeant Parks.
-Keep Distance, Gallagher.
Yes.
Good morning, dr. Selkirk.
-Quiet, Please.
Is everyone here?
Let's get started.
The Periodic Table.
Close your eyes and visualize it.
And open. Actinides, Anne.
-Actinium. Thorium.
With the numbers.
Who knows the numbers?
89, 90th
-Yes. Peter.
Uran. 92nd
-Protactinium As uranium. Kenny.
Cobalt?
-Actiniderne. Seventh row.
Neptunium.
-Neptunium.
Atomic number? A half point.
Switch to the fourth period.
19, potassium. 20, calcium.
21, scandium.
Alkaline earth metals.
Down from the second row.
Joe.
Good morning, children.
Good morning, Miss Justineau.
I hope you feel better.
-I have. Thank you, Melanie.
I'm done with regression therapy.
We have not gone through
the periodic table yet.
It's just data pairs. The content
is not really relevant, is it?
Enjoy.
-Okay. I have elements here.
Lots of them.
-Will You please read to us?
So some say it to dr. Caldwell,
and so smoker I in the hole for a week.
We do not say anything.
I read aloud the last time.
To Greek mythology counts as history.
Okay. So we warm up
with a single story.
Reach. Where were we?
-Prometheus And Epimetheus.
The war against the gods.
-I am in. Thank you, Melanie.
It was because so little, Miss Justineau.
"The gods will not forget -
-and Zeus would punish Epimetheus
for his misdeeds -
-so he created a woman of clay -
-and called her Pandora.
'He who has all gifts'.
Pandora opened the box,
and all the plagues and tribulations -
-any accident and evil
in the world, knocked out of it.
They have been human scourge on
Because of Pandora's curiosity. "
Goodnight, Private Dillon.
Goodnight, Private Devani.
Sleep tight, Cujo.
-You Should not speak to it.
"But then beheld Pandora into the box
and found one thing.
It was hoped, and she took it up
in his hands and set it free. "
The hope is the good that does,
To endure all that bad.
But there's nothing bad here.
Is that right?
Good night, black and white kitten.
No.
We have found fine.
Goodnight, Miss Justineau.

Hey, Melanie.
Hey, dr. Caldwell.
Have you solved the puzzle?
-No Broke into the room.
Lupin stole the jewels as he pretended
as if he checked, they were there.
Beautiful. Here is another one.
There is a cat in a box.
It may be alive or dead.
There are equally good chances.
How do you find out?
-You Open the box.
Before that, while the box is closed.
Is the cat alive or dead?
Can I listen?
-No.
Or shake the box or weigh it?
Or drill a hole in it?
Not something like that.
This is pure logic.
I have to think about it.
What do you write?
- "Experimental Subject's reactions."
"Beautiful imitation
the observed behavior. "
Question mark.
-What does it mean?
That nothing yet has been decided.
Say a number between 1 and 20th
13th
-Thanks.
Reassignment. Come on!
Up with you! Transfer!
Come on, cursed abortions! Up!
So it's up!
-We Have agreed to be here.
For three months, not six months.
Where is Kenny?
Coming Kenny to hour?
I should be in Beacon now.
Said Carlisle,
these guys come here next week.
He said last week.
" 'But no,' said the old man.
'It's your sailors -
-which has been transformed
the animals of the witch. '
'By the gods,' screamed Odysseus,
'If the fate fell to me -
-ville I rather die
for your own. ' "
In hard-to enthuse.
-Coming Kenny to class today?
No not today.
-Tomorrow?
I have an idea. Now I lock up
for you so that you can write.
And then you get your hills, and so can you
create a tale to me.
We do not know any.
-Only Them, They have spoken.
I have to find on your own.
-What Should they be about?
Anything. It is up to you.
Look at the dank little pigs.
How can she keep them out?
-But She's damn delicious.
Okay, time is up. Put the pencils.
Who could imagine
reading up?
Melanie. Put you on.
"Once upon a time in ancient
Greece was a woman.
She was very beautiful. The most beautiful,
nicest, brightest women in the world.
One day she went out in the woods,
when she was attacked by a monster.
It was a damned abortion,
and it would eat her.
The woman fought bravely against
but the monster was very large and grim.
She could not kill it.
Both her sword and spear broke.
The monster was about to devour her,
But then came a girl.
She was like Achilles,
for she was invulnerable -
-except in a secret location.
She killed the monster
and beheaded it.
And then she trudged back.
And the woman ... The woman said:
'You are my very own girl.
We will always be together. '
'And I will never let go of you.'
And they lived happily together
till the end of their days."
Pardon.
Can I try again?
Can not I try again?
No! No way, damn it!
-It Was not ... Cross.
You touched her.
You touched her face.
-It Was on top of his head.
Look here.
No, you will not have enough help?
Stop it!
You think they are people
because they look like.
No I do not think so.
-Well. Thus ends your lesson.
What are you looking at?
If I had a box full of
all the world's evil, you smoke it.
Well, damn. So I have to make sure
you never get hold of a box.
She better like me. She touched
me. She would never touch you.
I have finished here.
-Remmene, Sergeant.
Melanie.
-Godaften, Miss Justineau.
Who has done this to you?
Hello?
Anyone here?
It was Sergeant Parks, right?
He did it.
Miss Justineau, They smell wonderful.
Do not talk to him, okay?
Promise me you will ignore him.
No! Out! Out!
Pardon!
Pardon!
BLOCKING GELS
Good evening, Melanie.
You have been visited, I can see.
No.
They are numbered.
I can look up if this is.
I think I know who it was.
Will you give me another number?
Everything between ...
Fire. Number four.
Do you mean it?
Fire?
Transfer! Up!
Wake up! Transfer!
Transfer!
Good morning, Private Raison.
Good morning, Sergeant Parks.
Where are we going?
What is this place?
Why do you shake it?
Sergeant. Fences 1 is overthrown!
-Use The flamethrower.
Do you need me for anything else?
-Completely Certainly not.
Lock the door behind me.
Stay inside, to be given clear signal.
Good morning, dr. Caldwell.
Good morning, dr. Selkirk.
Good morning, Melanie.
Have you thought about it with the cat?
The cat in the box?
-It's Either alive or dead.
It's just gone.
-Why?
Cats are smart.
-Standardsvaret Is "two."
Alive and dead at the same time.
-It Sounds stupid.
Possibly.
But that's why you're here, right?
To figure out the mystery.
It's you, Melanie. In it
Here analogy you've opened the box -
-and you have seen yourself inside it.
Sorry.
Dr. Caldwell,
I would like to return to class.
Three milliliters of thiopental.
Good morning, Miss Justineau.
-Helen, We are in the midst of an intervention.
Stop. I do not want to anymore.
You still doubt yourself, Helen.
-I Did not join it here.
Yes, exactly.
Vi cuts in children.
They look like children.
You know what I think about it.
The toxin in the fungus
think of them?
You just talk to them
for five minutes.
I do this every day.
I read your reports every day.
Helen, this conversation I
had myself a thousand times.
But I listen to.
See. I have put the scalpel.
So you can put your ... arms.
Would you please?
Would you please?
Miss Justineau!
-Tilkald Guards. Now!
No! Leave her alone!
Wait a minute. Helen, this is not
a second biopsy performed in the dark.
This is a manufacturing procedure.
I make a test portion
of the vaccine -
-and she is the main ingredient.
I respect your feelings.
But they are not permissible.
Find a safe place for her.
We are very busy right now.
-In Charge of her.
Miss Justineau!
Should we postpone the surgery?
-No. Run barrier down.
She moves too much.
-There Is a head strap to the left.
I can not cut around a strap.
-Do I give her another dose?
Yes, Jean. It would be ...
Die, damn it!
Miss Justineau!
Melanie!
Away, you stupid bitch!
Come on!
Melanie. Melanie.
Come here.
It's okay, Melanie.
It is okay.
Send our coordinates.
Call it a gathering place first
-Sergeant!
No, sergeant!
-She Does not matter! Shut her out.
Close her out,
and then she was gone. Come on.
What the hell are you doing?
You have not the right to decide!
Nothing on any frequencies.
-So We leave.
But you have to grab the test subject.
Gallagher,
look for supplies in the closet.
Dillon, you cover the child.
Shoot her,
unless she stir.
Stay close to the vehicle.
No, not too close.
I dont do that.
Are you okay?
I've done something bad.
You did something good. You saved me
like in your story.
It was not.
I ate of the soldiers.
The girl in my story did not eat people.
If there were any, they would be here
or have answered over the radio.
Do we have any water?
-Vognen Was in the workshop.
The water tank was emptied. There is
drinking bottles, little ammunition -
-blokeringsgelé and here.
I think they used it,
then they had to catch ...
I know what it is.
Justineau!
Wait here.
Listen up. We need to head south to Beacon.
We take water and take off.
And the staff at the base? The children?
-We Must assume they are dead.
And concerning the children, then eats
the hungry not their own.
And Melanie?
-She Belong to the project.
Remove the spare wheel
and put her in the wheel well.
Gave the catharsis?
Once is enough.
-She Must not into the wheel well.
It must be absolutely clear.
-No, She will not.
The silencers on. Dum-dum bullets.
How can the balls be stupid?
-Do I give it a gag on?
They are hollow at the tip. so spreads
themselves and do not come out again.
Less blood splashes. Then there are less
risk of spread of the infection.
Thank you, Sergeant Parks.
Lets go.
Hurry up.
I said, silencers!
Excuse me, I ... Shit!
Come on. Come on. Run! Run!
Sergeant!
Sergeant!
Shit!
Damn!
Get its head up!
Get its head up, dammit!
Move! Come on!
Your arm.
It is not a bite, Sergeant.
I cut myself on a stone.
Stay there.
-I Cut myself, Sergeant.
Wait.
-Do I just stand here?
I told you I was okay.
I am alright. There is no ga ...
He was becoming one of them.
As dr. Selkirk.
What the hell is she doing here?
-She Mask on, and she is bound.
And you're still afraid of her?
-Yes. And it should also be.
Melanie.
The starved have some kind of disease.
The humans can be infected by.
-It Is a fungal infection.
Ophiocordyceps unilateralis.
It is transmitted in body fluids.
So your bite ...
-She Does not bite anyone.
Did they follow us?
-Probably not. They gather in flocks.
We do not know why.
You may be lonely.
I had not considered.
The fuel line was hit,
so it is Shanks's mare here.
We take the direct route
through London.
There are several hungry, but also
more food. And it goes faster.
Can not we just get Beacon
to send a helicopter?
I've tried. The truck's
radio transmitter is not powerful enough.
We use the mobile radio,
when we are closer.
Let's go for a walk.
-Getting.
Do we get the river to see? Thames?
It is England's second longest river.
It has its origins in Cotswold
Hills. How deep is the river?
In "How the elephant got its trunk"
the water went to the elephant's feet -
-but who can sail both rivers,
and fish living in them.
Here. Be careful where you step.
They are everywhere, Sergeant.
The shops have long since emptied.
Maybe we can find something in the houses.
Hungry?
-Tons. We're moving into.
But tiptoes.
-Seen A whole bunch of them?
They respond primarily on smell.
The gel enables us invisible to them.
To some extent. Loud noises and fast
movements activates them.
We are slowly but surely.
No talk or eye contact.
Okay?
Okay?
-We Are not children, Sergeant Parks.
Especially not her there.
Caldwell.
Up. Up. All. Up.
Come on. Up. Up.
Okay. Let's find us right.
-What?
Would you rather back out there?
What was going on, Doctor?
I've never seen caring behavior
in a hungry.
I collected data,
which is a part of our mission.
Yes, until the fence toppled.
Now our mission
not to end up on the menu.
I'll be more careful,
when it is possible.
Let us ensure privacy.
We'd better explore it all.
Make sure we're alone here.
Melanie gets here.
Someone must stay with her.
She should not be exposed to danger.
I'll be all right,
Miss Justineau. I am not afraid.
Justineau, you take the left side.
Gallagher, right. Be awake.
Melanie, if you need me,
then cry for me. Very high.
Yes, Miss Justineau.
Dr. Caldwell.
What am I?
-We Do not have a word for it.
But you know where I come from?
Will not you tell me?
sergeant Parks
and his people went into the cities -
-on the hunt for supplies.
On one of the trips they found something else.
Neonatal. Newborns.
Infected. Definitely hungry.
However, quite different.
They could still thinking
and interact with their environment.
In many ways they acted
as real people.
Why were they different?
They were partially immune to
toxin that creates the hungry.
But where did they come from?
-There, All children come from.
But along a ...
... Somewhat special way.
The newborn was found in one place
like this. A feed time.
Where mothers giving birth.
The mothers were also there. They were ...
... Inch. Dugout.
All of their bodies had been eaten.
Of the hungry?
-No.
From the inside.
Babies can not eat people.
-It Did here.
The mothers were probably infected
at the same time. Simultaneously.
And the fetuses were also infected.
Through the placenta.
They ate out.
I would not be hungry.
-But You are.
This is evident by a dissection.
The fungus meanders about your brain
as an ivy on an oak tree.
But I can talk just like you.
-You Are unlike anything else.
You said you could make a vaccine.
-This Is my only goal.
Nothing is more important.
I want to save people, Melanie.
I would save everyone.
I tried
to find some food for you -
-but I could not.
But I found something else.
They're cool, right? Now you can get rid
for those stink bombs.
They are really fine. Thanks.
Tomorrow I try to find
some food for you. Tomorrow morning.
Can you cope until then?
Do you think Beacon noticed
we are not on the radio anymore?
It is hard to say.
They call when they can.
But they have been squeezed.
Each day has enough of its nuisance.
Consorting you do not
Non officers?
Have you ever killed a child?
I was in the reserve force.
I did not have a cat mischief
before all this shit.
She looks at me like I was Jesus.
-She Loves you.
Yes. She loves Me.
I could not
get away from it in time.
I'm not a good person.
I've never met a good
or bad person.
Man does just
what is necessary.
So no need to answer
for their actions?
Reply to whom?
" 'He dreams," said Gemini Dig.
'What do you think he dreams?'
'Nobody can know.'
'About you, perhaps,' said Gemini Dig.
'And if he dreams about you
where is could he be now? '
'Where I am now,' said Alice.
'Not you,' took Gemini You to
retorted. 'You are not going anywhere.'
'You are just something in his dream.' "
Do you see the picture, Kieran?
It looks bad. They must be
been attracted by the noise yesterday.
If we wait, pops up something
a cat or something.
And then chasing it.
-We Have to wait long.
It will be OK.
-I can do it.
No. I will not allow.
-They Will not hurt me.
She has no reason
to come back to us.
Yes I have.
I will be with you.
At least
with Miss Justineau and Kieran.
And you would shoot her yesterday.
What have you got to lose?
Pretty much.
She is indispensable for my project.
The project is no more.
There is only us.
I promise to come back,
and I'm not lying.
And I must take my new clothes?
Hello?
Transfer! Transfer!
Cursed abortions.
It fell off,
but there are certainly down here now.
Oh God.
-I Am not hungry now.
Well done. Come on.
Do we just wade into it again?
-Not With my good will.
Want some more exercise?
You can run ahead
and find us a clear route.
Can I borrow radio gizmo?
Gallagher, give her your radio gizmo.
You get it back.
Here you go.
Show it to me.
Tap here if you want to talk.
Slip, so I can answer you.
It is Melanie. Hello, I'm here.
-Exactly. Off you go.
And play now not with anyone
who looks like death.
She just take care of it.
Hello, this is Melanie.
Melanie call over the radio.
I know. So what?
The third street is best.
There are a few starved at the beginning, -
-but otherwise empty street.
Thanks. Switches and ends.
Well done.
Would you like a cat?
I have already tasted one.
So damn.
Doctor.
I saw it here in Bristol. And those in
Glasgow say they spread everywhere.
It is next stage
of the fungal life cycle.
Let it be.
Is that what is in my brain?
Will it happen to me?
Perhaps. Do you know what is symbiosis?
As the birds that cleans teeth
on crocodiles.
Exact. And in the second generation,
your generation -
-is the fungus may
gone in symbiosis with you.
It seems, at least so.
Let me know if you shoot buds.
There has been quite quiet.
-It Must be out of season.
Gallagher, do not step on them.
It comes we never over.
We must go around it.
What the hell is that?
What is it that, Caldwell?
Preparing the next stage of the life cycle of the fungus.
The mature stage. It is therefore,
no hungry here.
When they are the closest to each other,
when enough of them are gathered ...
So they become a forest?
This is a sporangium.
A sporehus.
There may be tens of thousands
of them in the mass there.
If they opened ...
-So what?
End of the world, I imagine.
Let's continue.
You are sick, dr. Caldwell.
-I am alright. Thanks.
You smell like someone who is ill.
I saw you.
You took with you.
May I see it?
Why should the world end,
if it opens?
So will the toxin become airborne.
One becomes infected by
breathing. But look.
It is bad furnishings. mutants
must take the rough with the smooth.
What the hell is that?
Fully armed. Code protected.
Nřdadgangen is under the door
in the middle section.
It was us who made them. fully
functional mobile laboratories.
Armed and armored. Solar powered,
so they need never stop.
Show me nřdadgangen.
-It's Less.
Come, Kieran.
The solar panels are still working.
I am checking,
the motor still works.
I have to find some food.
MUSHROOMS-HUNTERS
DO IT IN THE DARK
I wonder where they are.
Perhaps they would explore the area.
And then they were hanging
with some friends?
What about the engine, Sergeant?
-I'm Gonna get it going.
Let's call Beacon first.
Refugees from base Hotel Echo
call Beacon, over.
Refugees from base Hotel Echo
call Beacon, over.
Refugees calls all
in the southeast area.
Did you check the kitchen?
-Skabene Are empty.
I look for supplies.
-Okay. We are working on the engine.
Gallagher, not too far away.
Report every ten minutes.
What?
-I Also need to eat.
I can smell you.
I can smell you all.
Try again.
Well done.
No. Oh no.
Should I change the dressing?
-No thanks. That does not make sense.
Doctor's that?
I am dying. It amazes me
you had not noticed it.
Inflammatory sepsis.
Blood poisoning from the wound.
I took flucloxacillin,
when we arrived here, -
-but I'm pretty sure
it is too late.
I am sorry.
-How Bad?
Will you let me have her?
Forget it.
I was so close when the base fell.
With this equipment I can reach the goal.
I can synthesize the vaccine,
but I need her brain -
-and her spine.
Isoflurane. Surgical anesthesia.
She will feel nothing.
It sounds more like you than her.
Miss Justineau!
Kieran is out there and it is they.
They have got wind of him.
I must find him first.
I must leave now!
Who, Melanie?
-Břrnene. They will eat him.
They were like me.
The chasing him.
They have the scent of him.
He blocking jelly on.
-It Smells of something.
How would they know the smell from?
-Is It not obvious?
Gallagher, what's your position?
Switches.
Gallagher, meld your position.
Switches.
Gallagher, meld your position.
Switches.
I can find him.
Can I please?
Let's go with her.
Beacon here. Copy?
Here. Received.
-Bekrćft Status. Switches.
London. North of the river.
About a day's march from Beacon.
Confirm base Hotel Echos status.
We must evacuate people,
while it still is possible.
The fences overturned.
They are inside the plant in a few hours.
Beacon, it's ...
-We Have to go now, Sergeant!
Beacon, it's ...
-We Have to go! It is Kieran!
He has been here many times.
He turned on.
The path! Come on!
Hello. What is your name then?
Is it yours?
No thanks. I have eaten.
Saturate.
You have more use for it.
Look at you. You're thin as a stick.
Okay. Okay.
It is okay. Come here.
It is okay.
I do not ... It's okay.
Do not be stupid.
It is okay. Come here.
Come here. It's not for fun.
Can you see this?
Can you see it, dammit?
If you touch me,
smoking in all in the air.
I mean it. I do it.
Grace ...
No. Grace ...
Help me get this stuff up.
Small pigs. The dirty little pig.
They just want to live.
It would all like.
Do you know what this is?
They laid a trap for him.
Just as one does with an animal.
Miss Justineau,
this is also a trap.
Sergeant, let me. Lower it.
Melanie!
Miss Justineau! Sergeant!
I should not look at them! Shut up!
Look only at me.
Just pretend you're afraid of me.
Pretend to?
Come on. Quickly.
They're mine! I can not get them!
If you try to take them ...
Hurry up.
I'd better just leave it!
As soon as we come in,
we drive, right?
If Beacon evacuates,
we must have the new coordinates.
And they should know Hotel Echo not
available anymore. Is there another base?
Shit. Why did she
left the door open?
Caroline, what are you doing?
I am much faster
than you, dr. Caldwell.
Are you trying to stab me, biting
I. It will not break you.
I do not need
to breathe as often as you.
At the base I kept tit weather
and spoke to thousands.
The fungus converts the oxygen for you.
-We Are probably in symbiosis.
Melanie. You're a smart girl.
Well I think, you know ...
You think you can make a cure of me.
-I can.
I can do it right here.
I have all the equipment here.
A cure that can save Helen.
And Sergeant Parks.
And Kieran.
Kieran is dead.
-But The others. Melanie.
Only the second generation
can be like you.
Want to Miss Justineau
turns into a monster? An animal?
No.
-Of course not.
It's up to you. You can
give her something no one else can.
A long, fulfilling life.
In safety.
Surrounded by people,
who loves her.
She can be safe in Beacon.
-Beacon Is falling.
It heard you.
She can go somewhere else.
-And When the track opens the houses?
They do not. It showed me.
You can not force them,
but they react to heat.
And moisture.
One flood or fire ...
I promise you,
it will not hurt.
Will you tell her?
She will know you did it
for her sake.
I need you lie down.
What about the kids, dr. Caldwell?
Lie down now. I do not have much
again. If I do not do it now ...
Experimental Subject's reaction. Beautiful
imitation of observed behavior.
Question mark. Do you still it?
Melanie, I ...
-Do you do it?
No.
Are we living?
-Yes.
I am living.
Why should it be us,
die for you?
Stay here. If you stay here,
you're safe.
Melanie.
Melanie.
You should have
inside the laboratory.
I was looking for you.
Is Miss Justineau with you?
She's in there.
Is the airlock closed?
Melanie, what is this all about?
The spores that make people hungry.
-Kors In the ass, dammit!
It makes me so sorry, sergeant.
What have you done?
I got tracks the houses to open.
-Cross.
It is okay.
-No. It is over.
It's not over.
It's just not yours anymore.
But I thought I would be
in safety. I closed the airlock.
Melanie.
Melanie.
I will not end up like one of them.
Would you please? Would you please?
Where did you learn it from?
-I'm Looking at you.
Of course you do.
The last time ...
The last time I saw her,
she was about seven months.
She was as big as a house.
She was so beautiful.

She was out there somewhere.

Oh God.
Good morning, Miss Justineau.
Good morning, Melanie.
Down!
Good morning, students.
Good morning, Miss Justineau.

Okay, we continue ...
Okay, we continue
to get the new on the bandwagon.
In other to be patient,
while they seek us.
Will you read to us?
Later. If there is time for it.
There is plenty of time.
