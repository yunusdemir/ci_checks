at the willard hotel
in washington, d.c.,
the poet julia ward howe
awoke from
a spectacular dream.
that day, she had heard
a new england regiment
singing on parade
and had fallen asleep
with the song
john brown's body
ringing in her head.
now in the dark,
she got up
and scribbled out the words
with a pencil stub.
she sold her poem
to theatlantic monthly
for $4.00.
it became the anthem
of the union.

and jean bernard foucault

in america,
the united states
passed the first
national income tax
to pay for war.
the gatling gun
was invented,
and war itself
was changing.
the shocking casualties
of bull run
and wilson's creek
were dwarfed
by battle after battle.
and now
there were new questions--
would the north's strength
be offset
by incompetence
and low morale?
would england side
with cotton and the south?
who would control
the mississippi?
for a year,
the nation, now two nations,
had torn itself apart.
from a bloodless duel
over a man-made island
in charleston harbor,
the war had spread along
a thousand-mile line
from manassas, virginia,
to shanghai, missouri,
and beyond.
as 1862 began,
over a million men
were massing for war.
in a fierce struggle
for tennessee,
"i saw that it was
going to have to be
a war of conquest
found themselves prisoners
in their own homes.
far north of any fighting,
the people of deer isle, maine,
suffered, too--
with sad news
from places most of them
had never heard of.
the little town
of winchester, virginia,
had changed hands 72 times.
sam watkins,
a confederate private,
would see
his first big battle
in april on the banks
of the tennessee.

in a union camp.
union general
george mcclellan,
the idol of his troops,
would fashion a mighty army
and lead it south
towards richmond,
where robert e. lee
was waiting.
"the struggle of today,"
lincoln told congress,
"is not altogether
for today--
it is
for a vast future also."
now, in this,
its second year,
the war
was becoming a struggle
over the future
of freedom.
it really
is one of those, um...
one of those
watershed things.
it was a huge chasm
between the beginning
and the end of the war.
the nation
had come face-to-face
with a dreadful tragedy,
and we reacted the way
a family would do
with a dreadful tragedy.
it was almost
inconceivable
that anything
that horrendous
could happen.
you must remember
that casualties
in civil war battles
were so far
beyond anything
we can imagine now.
if we had 10% casualties
in a battle today,
it would be looked on
as a blood bath.
they had 30%
in several battles,
and one after another,
you see.
"this morning
we were called out
"this afternoon,
seeing the general
alone in the office,
"i stepped up to him
and said,
"general, i want
to go home.
"want to go home,
and for what?
he replied.
"as i could not
think of an excuse,
"i blurted out,
i want to see
my mother.
"is she sick?
he asked.
"no,i i replied,
i hope not.
"he then asked me
how long since
i left home
"and if i was
ever away
"for so long a time
before.
"i had been
in the service
7 months
"and never been away
from home alone
before.
"well,
said the general,
"you have been
a good boy,
and you shall
have a furlough
for 10 days."
elisha hunt rhodes.
"i always shot at privates.
"it was they that did
the shooting and killing,
"and if i could kill
or wound a private,
"why, my chances
were so much the better.
i always looked on officers
as harmless personages."
sam watkins.
the commander
of sam watkins' company h
was captain
william r. johnston.
his immediate superior
was colonel george maney
of the 1st tennessee.
from there, the confederate
chain of command
ascended through
colonel william h. stephens
of the 2nd brigade
to general
benjamin cheatham,
commander
of the 2nd division
of general leonidas polk's
1st army corps,
then to general
albert sidney johnston,
commander of the army
of the mississippi,
above that, to war secretary
george w. randolph...
finally,
to jefferson davis,
president of the confederate
states of america.
the chain of command descended
from president lincoln,
secretary of war
simon cameron,
and general mcclellan,
commander of the army
of the potomac,
to general erasmus keyes,
commander of the union
4th corps,
general darius n. couch

throughout lincoln's
presidency--
and this is true
of most presidents--
he was fairly run crazy
by office seekers,
especially at the start
when his campaign managers
had promised jobs
to a great many people
who came to collect them.
and he looked
particularly worried.
the man said, "what's
the matter, mr. president?"
and lincoln said,
"there's too many pigs
for the tits."
abraham lincoln's problems
were not confined
to fighting rebels alone.
the president's
unwieldy cabinet
included former
conservative whigs,
freesoil whigs,
and union democrats.
4 had been his rivals
for the republican
presidential nomination.
nearly all
were privately sure
they could do a better job
than their chief.
secretary of state
william h. seward
hoped to replace lincoln.
secretary of the treasury
salmon p. chase
wanted to replace seward.
mary todd told her husband
to get rid of both
of them.
instead, lincoln fired war
secretary simon p. cameron,
a pennsylvania boss
so corrupt, said lincoln,
the only thing
he wouldn't steal
was a red-hot stove.
the new secretary of war
was edwin m. stanton,
an able, ruthless
war democrat from ohio
who worried about
what he believed to be
lincoln's
"painful imbecility."
on one thing,
the cabinet was agreed.
general george mcclellan
was not moving fast enough
against the confederates.
"the army," secretary of war
stanton said,
"has got to fight
or run away.
"the champagne and oysters
on the potomac
must be stopped."
"dear ellen,
"i can't tell you
how disgusted
i am becoming
"with these
wretched politicians.
"they are a most
despicable set of men.
"seward is a meddling,
officious, incompetent
little puppy.
"the president
is nothing more
than a well-meaning
baboon."
george mcclellan.
the president
pored over military books,
asked officers for advice,
and in exasperation,
suggested that
"if general mcclellan
"does not want
to use the army,
i would like to borrow it
for a time."
finally,
he ordered mcclellan
to move
on manassas junction
and then proceed overland
to take richmond,
but mcclellan
would not move
and took to his bed
with a fever.
mcclellan
did not want to fight
the vast confederate army
he had convinced himself
now occupied
northern virginia.
instead, he proposed
to float his army
to fortress monroe
at the tip
of the finger of land
between the james
and york rivers,
then race up
the peninsula
to seize
the confederate capital.
impatient for any action,
lincoln agreed.
mcclellan would move
in mid-march.
it had been 8 months
since the northern army
had crawled back
into washington
after bull run.
"february 9, 1862.
"dear mr. president,
"general mcclellan
has almost ruined
your administration
"and the country.
"he is a do-nothing.
"he is thinking
of the presidency
in '64.
"he is placating
the rebels--
"that's what
ails him.
depend upon it."
joseph medill.
"what shall i do?
"the people
are impatient.
"chase has no money
"and tells me
he can raise no more.
"the general of the army,
mcclellan,
"has typhoid fever.
"the bottom
is out of the tub.
what shall i do?"
"washington.
"dear ellen,
"i went
to the white house
shortly after tea
"where i found
the original
gorilla,
"about as
intelligent as ever.
what a specimen
to be at the head
of our affairs now."
george mcclellan.
in the midst
of all his troubles,
the president delighted
in his sons.
the oldest, robert,
was away at harvard,
but willie, 11,
and 8-year-old thomas,
known as tad,
had the run
of the white house.
willie was studious,
liked to compose verse
and memorize
railroad timetables.
he had raised
a boys' battalion
from among
his schoolmates
and invaded cabinet meetings
with his "troops."
he developed what the doctor
called "bilious fever."
his parents sat up
night after night
to nurse him.
on february 20,
willie died.
for 3 months,
mary lincoln veered
between loud weeping
and silent depression
and sought to communicate
with her dead child
through spiritualists.
"if i had not felt
"the spur of necessity
urging me to cheer
mr. lincoln,
"whose grief
was as great as my own,
i could never
have smiled again."
the war left lincoln
little time to mourn.
he was soon back working
18 hours a day.
"as she came plowing
through the water,
"she looked like a huge
half-submerged crocodile.
"at her prow,
i could see the iron ram
projecting straight forward."
the confederacy
had begun the war
with no navy whatsoever,
but by the fall of 1861,
confederate engineers
were bolting iron plates
to the hull of
the steam frigate
merrimack,
building a warship
more powerful
than anything
the union had.
news of the monster
quickly reached the north.
secretary of war stanton
feared she would
steam up the potomac
and shell the white house.
there was probably
only one man in america
who could stop
themerrimack,
and he was mad
at the navy.
the swedish-born inventor
john ericsson
was proud, vain,
and cranky
and felt he had been
cheated out of payment
for services to
the government years before,
but when secretary
of the navy gideon welles
begged him to do something
to stop themerrimack,
ericsson came up with
an extraordinary design.
his ship
would have only two guns
to themerrimack's10,
but they would be mounted
on a revolving turret.
and though his vessel would
be made entirely of iron,
ericsson assured everybody
that "the sea
shall ride over her,
and she shall live in it
like a duck."
professional navy men
dismissed the plan,
but lincoln
overruled them,
and just 100 days later
on january 30, 1862,
ericsson's ship slid
into manhattan's east river.
he called her themonitor,
and there had never been
anything like her.
the single vessel contained
47 patentable inventions.
"we ran first
to the new york side
"and then to brooklyn,
"and so back and forth
across the river,
"like a drunken man
on a sidewalk.
we found
she would not answer
her rudder at all."
once at sea,
water spilled in,
ventilators failed,
the ship filled with gas,
her crew began to faint.
but themonitor
kept limping south.
400 miles away,
off the coast of virginia,
themerrimackwas waiting.
saturday, march 8,
was wash day
for the union fleet
in hampton roads, virginia.
laundry was drying
on the rigging
of the union warships
when the confederate
merrimack
headed straight
for the u.s.s.cumberland.
[cannons firing]
thecumberland
opened fire,
but the shots
bounced harmlessly
off themerrimack'sside.
the confederate ship
rammed thecumberland,
then stood in so close,
their muzzles
almost touched.
thecumberland
sank in shallow water.
themerrimackwent on
to set
the u.s.s.congressafire,
drove the u.s.s.minnesota
aground,
then drew back
for the night.
for one day,
the confederate navy
ruled the sea.
at 1:00 that morning,
the crew
of the batteredminnesota
saw a strange-looking ship
draw up alongside them
in the darkness.
"close alongside
theminnesota,
"there was a craft
such as the eyes of a seaman
"never looked upon before--
"an immense shingle
floating on the water
"with a gigantic cheese box
rising from its center.
"no sails, no wheels,
no smokestack, no guns.
what could it be?"
themonitorhad arrived.
[cannons firing]
the epic battle
of ironclads began.
hull to hull, the two ships
hammered away at each other,
as the men inside,
half-blind with smoke,
loaded and fired.
after 4 1/2 hours,
themerrimackdrew off.
it was her only fight.
two months later,
rather than surrender
their ship,
the confederates
blew her up
when they were forced
out of norfolk.
both sides set to work
building more ironclads
while europe watched
in worried fascination.
from the moment
the two ships
opened fire
that sunday morning,
every other navy on earth
was obsolete.
"general grant
habitually
wears an expression
"as if he had
determined
to drive his head
through a brick wall
and was about
to do it."
the year 1862
would introduce two great
forces into the war--
unspeakable slaughter
and ulysses s. grant.
while mcclellan
hesitated in washington,
grant, back in the field
after months of desk duty,
won two crucial victories
out west.
launching simultaneous attacks
by land and water,
he took first fort henry
on the tennessee river
and then fort donelson
on the cumberland,
where he issued an ultimatum
to the confederate commander--
"no terms
except unconditional
and immediate surrender."
the tennessee
and cumberland rivers
were now in union hands.
the confederates had been
driven from kentucky.
dozens of southern towns
were now occupied
by union troops.
in less than a year,
gr from clerk
to union hero.
news stories described him
coolly smoking under fire,
and admirers shipped him
barrels of cigars.
a delighted northern public
now thought they knew
what the initials
in his name stood for.
they called him
"unconditional surrender"
grant.
but before grant's men
marched into fort donelson,
confederate general
nathan bedford forrest
slipped out of it
with 1,000 men.
"i did not come here
for the purpose
of surrendering my command,"
he said,
and led his troops 75 miles
through the snow to safety.
would meet
bedford forrest again.
after the confederate defeat
at fort donelson,
the female academy
and stewart college
at nearby
clarksville, tennessee,
were converted
to hospitals.
"sunday the news came.
"such panic-stricken people
were never before seen.
"the wounded
were being brought up.
"the citizens were running.
"there were already
two hospitals here
"which were filled
with the sick,
"and they, poor fellas,
were crawling out
from every piece
"walking,
going on horseback,
in wagons."
nannie haskins.
the union army was
right behind the wounded.
they met no resistance.
a white flag flew
above tiny fort defiance
west of town,
and mayor smith came out
to inform
the union commander
that the confederate army
had retreated to nashville.
farmer john barker
wrote in his diary
that there were nothing
but "lincolnites"
throughout the county.
an uneasy federal occupation
of clarksville began.
early in the war,
a union squad closed in
on a single
ragged confederate,
and he obviously
didn't own any slaves.
he couldn't have
much interest
in the constitution
or anything else.
they said, "what are you
fighting for anyhow?"
they asked him.
and he said,
"i'm fighting
because you're
down here,"
which was a pretty
satisfactory answer.
on april 4,
george mcclellan at last
began to move
for richmond--
121,500 men,
14,592 horses and mules,
1,150 wagons,
44 batteries
of artillery,
ambulances,
pontoon bridges,
tons of provisions,
tents, telegraph wire.
it took 400 boats
3 weeks to land it all
at fortress monroe
on the virginia coast.
"the whole region
seems
"literally filled
with soldiery.
"one of
the finest armies
"ever marshalled

possible loss."
but at yorktown,
less than 20 miles away,
the confederates waited,
vastly outnumbered,
but determined
to defend their homes
and hurl back
the invaders.

finally, on april 5,
the advance guard
reached yorktown,
where the confederates
had taken over the building
used by lord cornwallis
as headquarters
during
the revolutionary war.
there were just 11,000
southern troops dug in,
not even a tenth
of mcclellan's force.
but the confederate
commander
was john bankhead magruder,
a showy virginian who loved
amateur theatricals.
he now outdid
even himself.
to fool mcclellan
into believing
that his small force
was enormous,
magruder kept up
a sporadic,
widely scattered
artillery barrage
and paraded one battalion
in and out of a clearing
in an endless circle
corporal edmund patterson,
9th alabama.

"it seems clear
that i shall have
the whole force
of the enemy on my hands,"
mcclellan
telegraphed lincoln,
"probably not less
than 100,000 men,
and possibly more."
mcclellan called
for reinforcements.
general joseph e. johnston,
the overall
confederate commander,
could not believe
his luck.
"nobodybut mcclellan,"
he said,
"could have hesitated
to attack."
"once more,
let me tell you,
"it is

"i have never

"the president

telegraphed me

"i was much
tempted to reply

and do it himself."
george mcclellan.
"i don't see the sense
"of piling up earth
to keep us apart.
"if we don't get
at each other some time,
"when will the war end?
"my plan would be
to quit ditching
and go to fighting."
but mcclellan chose
to dig in.
as he settled in
for a siege of yorktown,
union general phil kearny
took to calling
his commander

the peninsula campaign,

to a stream.
and he and his staff
were sitting there
wondering
how deep it was,
if they had to march
across it.
and custer, who was
a junior officer
on his staff--
just graduated
from west point,
a captain, i think--
rode out into midstream,
sat on his horse,
and turned around
in the saddle
and said, "mcclellan,
this is how deep
it is, general."

in early april,
as mcclellan continued
to sit in front
of yorktown,
42,000 union troops under
general ulysses s. grant
were encamped on the west side
of the tennessee river
near pittsburg landing.
grant's invasion
of tennessee
had practically
cut the state in two,
and now he was waiting
for don carlos buell's
army of the ohio
to join him.
their combined forces
were then to plunge
into the heart
of mississippi.
but buell was late,
and at corinth, mississippi,
22 miles away,

the western department
of the confederate army,

evenly matched,

something else, too,
"something i had
never seen before...
"a gaudy sort
of thing
with red bars...
a rebel flag."
"one more charge
and their lines
waver and break.
"they retreat
in wild confusion...
"we were jubilant,
"and the officers
could not curb their men
to keep them in line."
sam watkins.
the battle extended
along a 3-mile front.
the worst fighting
was in the center,
where the rebels came
on and on
like "maddened demons,"
a union soldier said.
the generals didn't
know their jobs.
the soldiers didn't
know their jobs.
it was just
pure determination
to stand and fight
and not retreat.
it also corrected
a southern misconception
which had said,
"one good
southern soldier
is worth 10
yankee hirelings."
they found out
that wasn't true
by a long shot.
in a peach orchard,
the federals lay flat
beneath
the blossoming trees,
firing as the rebels came,
soft pink petals
raining down
on the living
and the dead.
by late morning, thousands
of untried federal troops
had seen enough.
most did not stop running until
they reached the river,
where almost 5,000 men
cowered beneath the bluff.
"we are sweeping the field,"
general johnston told
his second in command,
beauregard,
"and i think we shall
press them to the river."
grant's back
was to the tennessee.
there was no sign of buell
and nowhere else to go,
but a thin federal line
held in the center,
illinois and iowa
farm boys mostly,
prone along
a sunken road.
their commander,
benjamin prentiss,
understood
the deadly seriousness
of grant's order
to "maintain that position
at all costs."
the confederates launched
a dozen massive assaults
against what became known
as the hornet's nest.
albert sidney johnston
himself led the last charge.
he came out of it
with bits of his clothing
nicked all up.
and he flapped his--
on horseback there,
and said, "they didn't
trip me up that time."
and very soon after that,
they saw him reel
in the saddle
and realized he was hurt,
and he said, "yes,
and i fear seriously."
and he was shot
behind the knee,
in the femoral artery
i suppose,
and bled to death.
they saw blood
coming out of his boot,
and he could have been easily
saved with a tourniquet,
but he had sent
his surgeon off
to take care of some
federal prisoners.
"advancing
a little further,
"we saw general
albert sidney
johnston
"surrounded
by his staff.
"we saw some
little commotion
"among those who
surrounded him,
"but we did not
know at the time
that he was dead.
the fact was kept
from the troops."
sam watkins.
the command
of the western army
now passed
to general beauregard.
albert sidney johnston
was looked on by many people
at the time of shiloh,
and especially before
shiloh while he was
holding that line
up in kentucky,
as the south's
number one field soldier.
jefferson davis
viewed him as that,
and when he lost
albert sidney johnston,
he said, "i realized
our strongest pillar
had been broken."
meanwhile, the center
of the union line
bent back on itself
but would not break.
the confederates
trained 62 cannon
at point-blank range
and opened fire.
the hornet's nest
exploded in a hail
of splintered trees
and shattered men.
at 5:30, prentiss
and the 2,200 survivors
of his division surrendered.
they had held up
the southern advance
for nearly 6 hours,
and it was growing dark.
beauregard wired
jefferson davis
that he had won
a complete victory.
"i had general grant
just where i wanted him,"
he said, "and could finish
him up in the morning."
everywhere, wounded men
lay in agony.
neither army had yet
devised a system
for gathering or caring
for them on the field.
scores of wounded
collapsed and died
drinking from a mud hole
near the peach orchard,
staining the water red.
it began to rain,
and flashes of lightning
showed hogs feeding
on the ungathered dead.
"some cried
for water,
"others for
someone to come
and help them.
"i can hear
those poor fellows
crying for water.
"god heard them,
for the heavens
opened
and the rain came."
grant spent that night
beneath a tree
rather than listen
to the screams
of the wounded men
in his headquarters.
it was there that
sherman found him.
"well, grant," he said,
"we've had the devil's
own day, haven't we?"
"yes," said grant,
"lick 'em tomorrow, though."
[steamboat whistle]
"never to me
was the sight
"of reinforcing
legions so welcome
"as on that sunday
evening
"when buell's
advance column
deployed
on the bluffs of
pittsburg landing."
during the night,
buell's army finally arrived.
the union men marched ashore
as a band playeddixie.
[cannon fire]
at dawn, the union force,
now 70,000 strong,
drove into
beauregard's 30,000.
the confederates fell back,
counterattacked,
fell back again,
and began to withdraw.
the union held the field.
covering
the confederate retreat
was nathan
bedford forrest,
who now turned to lead
one last cavalry charge
headlong into the pursuing
northern army.
and he landed square
in the main body
of the union troops.
he was surrounded by--
one gray uniform
in a sea of blue,
and they began
to holler,
"kill him.
kill the goddamn rebel.
knock him
off his horse."
and one soldier did
stick his rifle out
into forrest's side,
and pulled the trigger
and lifted forrest
clear of the saddle
with the impact
of the bullet,
and forrest, meantime,
was slashing with his saber.
his horse was kicking
and turning,
and forrest sawed
him around
and got him clear
and took off,
and they were
shooting after him,
so he reached down
and grabbed one
union soldier
and swung him
up behind him
on the crupper of the horse
to use as a shield.
he threw the man off
and rode back,
to join his command.
that was the last shot fired
in the battle of shiloh.
the ground, grant said,
was so covered with dead
that it would have
been possible to walk
across the clearing
in any direction,
stepping on dead bodies
without a foot
touching the ground.
"when the grave
was ready,
"we placed the bodies
therein, two deep.
"all the monument reared
to those brave men
was a board
"upon which i cut
with my pocket knife
the words125 rebels."
2,477 men were killed
at shiloh.
there were 23,000
casualties overall--
more than all
the american casualties
in all previous
american wars combined.
and it was only
the beginning.
shiloh had the same
number of casualties
as waterloo,
and yet, when
it was fought,
there were another
20 waterloos to follow.
and grant, shortly
before shiloh, said,
"i consider this war
practically over.
they're ready
to give up."
and the day after
shiloh, he said,
if we were to win."
shiloh did that,
but it sobered
the nation up
something awful,
the realization
that they had
a very bloody affair
on their hands.
and it called for
a huge reassessment
of what this thing
was going to be.
years afterward,
a union veteran said
the most a soldier
could say of any fight was
"i was worse scared
than i was at shiloh."
shiloh
is a hebrew word
meaning
"place of peace."
"april 11, 1862.
"i firmly believe that
before many centuries more,
"science will be
the master of man.
"the engines
he will have invented
"will be beyond
his strength to control.
"someday science shall have
the existence of mankind
"in its power,
"and the human race
commit suicide
by blowing up the world."
henry adams.
the armies that u.s. grant
and george mcclellan led
were the best-equipped
in history.
the productive capacity
and technical ingenuity
of the north
were now focused
on weapons.
and the civil war
would see
the first
railroad artillery,
the first land mines
and telescopic sights,
the first
military telegraphs.
in 1862 alone,
240 patents were issued
for military weapons.
lincoln was fascinated
by new weaponry.
he personally tested
new rifles
and ordered up
10 union repeating guns,
forerunners
of the machine gun,
but he passed up
a scheme
to manufacture
canoe-shaped footwear
for walking on water
and tactfully declined
a herd of war elephants
offered by
the king of siam.
oh, they had
many crazy ideas,
along with
some good ones.
there was one plan
to use two cannon,
each with a cannonball,
and the two cannonballs
connected by a chain.
and you would fire
the two cannons
at the same time,
and the balls
would go out,
and the chain
between them
would just cut a swath
through everything
in their way.
the trouble was,
one cannon, of course,
went off before
the other one did
with the result
that the ball went
around in a circle
from the other cannon.
the most important
innovation of the whole war
was the rifled musket,
along with
a french refinement--
caw bullet,
an inch-long lead slug
that expanded into
the barrel's rifled grooves
and spun
as it left the muzzle.
the minie ball could kill
at half a mile
and was accurate
at 250 yards--
5 times as far
as any other one-man weapon.
the age of the bayonet
charge had ended,
though most officers
did not yet know it
when the war began,
and some had still
not learned it
when the war was over.
it was brutal stuff.
the reason for
the high casualties
is really quite simple--
the weapons were way
ahead of the tactics.
the rifle itself,
it threw a .53 caliber
soft lead bullet
at a low
muzzle velocity,
and when it hit--
the reason there were
so many amputations--
if you got hit here,
it didn't clip your bone
the way the modern
steel-jacketed bullet does.
you didn't have any bone
from here to here.
they had no choice
but to take the arm off,
and you'll see pictures
of the dead on the battlefield
with their clothes
in disarray
as if someone had been
going--rifling their bodies.
that was the men themselves
tearing their clothes up
to see where
the wound was,
and they knew
perfectly well
if they were
gut shot, they'd die.
"april 25, 1862,
"pittsburg landing,
tennessee.
"dear julia...
"i'm no longer boss.
"general halleck
is here,
"and i'm truly
glad of it.
"i hope the papers
will let me alone
"in the future.
"outside of putting
down this rebellion
"and getting back
once more
"to live quietly
and unobtrusively
"with my family,
i think they would
say fewer falsehoods."
ulysses s. grant.
ulysses s. grant's reward
for the costly
union victory at shiloh
was to be removed
from field command.
grant's superior was
general henry wager halleck,
a calculating
administrator
who was jealous
of grant's success
and anxious to get rid
of his chief rival.
after the battle
of fort donelson,
he spread rumors
grant was drinking.
after the fearful
losses at shiloh,
he had grant reassigned.
grant decided to quit,
but his friend
william tecumseh sherman
talked him out of it.
"you could not be quiet
at home for a week,"
he said, "when armies
are moving."
grant and sherman
were both ohio boys
and west pointers
who were fond of cigars,
scorned
pomp and politics,
and had fared poorly
in civilian life.
grant enjoyed sherman's
rapid-fire brilliance
and was grateful
for the dispatch
with which he carried out
every order.
sherman admired
his friend's cool temper,
his steadiness
in the midst of crisis,
and what he called grant's
"simple faith in success."
they trusted each other.
"i'm a damned sight
smarter than grant.
"i know more about
organization, supply,
and administration,
"and about everything else
than he does.
"but i'll tell you
where he beats me
"and where he beats
the world--
"he don't care a damn
for what the enemy does
out of his sight,
but it scares me
like hell."
william tecumseh sherman.
"any attempt now
"to separate
the freedom of the slave
"from the victory
of the government,
"any attempt to secure
peace to the whites
"while leaving
the blacks in chains,
"moulders
and glassblowers,
"will be labor lost.
"the american people
"and the government
at washington
"may refuse to
recognize it for a time,
"but the inexorable
logic of events
"will force it upon them
in the end--
"that the war now
being waged in this land
is a war for
and against slavery."
frederick douglass.
letter by letter,
speech by speech,
month after month,
frederick douglass
tirelessly lobbied
the government
in washington,
urging lincoln
to emancipate the slaves.
but the president
still insisted
the war was being fought
for union
and publicly avoided douglass
and the debate.
"our southern friend
tells us
"the north is fighting
for negroes.
"our union friend says
"they're not fighting
to free the negroes
"but for the union.
"very well.
"let the whites fight
for what they want,
"we negroes fight
for what we want.
"liberty
must take the day,
"nothing shorter.
"we care nothing
about the union.
"we have been
in it slaves
over 250 years."
"whatever nation
gets the control
"of the ohio, mississippi,
and missouri rivers
will control
the continent."
william tecumseh sherman.
[explosions]
out west, union naval strategy
was straightforward--
seize control
of the mississippi
and cut
the confederacy in two.
on april 7,
union gunboats
and 2,000 troops
took the confederate fortress
at island number 10
near new madrid, missouri,
leaving the river open
as far south as memphis.
two months later,
memphis fell.
on the night of april 24,
a 60-year-old flag officer,
david g. farragut,
started north
up the mississippi,
intent on capturing
new orleans.
but first he had
to get by the heavy guns
at forts jackson
and st. phillips,
70 miles below the city.
when the moon rose,
the confederates opened fire
and sent blazing rafts
drifting into the union fleet.
the first vessel
was hit 42 times.
farragut's own flagship
was set on fire.
but somehow the entire fleet
made it past the forts.
new orleans surrendered
the next day.
farragut had
the american flag raised
over city hall.
"new orleans gone--
"and with it,
the confederacy?
"are we not cut in two?
that mississippi
ruins us, if lost."
mary chesnut.
"tupelo,
mississippi.
"i don't
know how the war
will be decided
"if england
and france
don't interfere
"and stop the war,
"and if
the confederacy
"has to gain
her independence
by fighting,
"i am afraid
she will have
to give it up,
"for there are
so few provisions
in this portion
of the confederacy."
james jackson.
in the following months,
farragut's fleet
gained control
of the southern mississippi
as far north
as baton rouge and natchez.
but the north did not
possess the whole river.
the confederate stronghold
at vicksburg still held.
"republics--
everybody jawing,
"everybody putting
their mouths in,
"nothing sacred,
"all confusion
of babble.
"republics
can't carry on war.
hurrah for a strong
one-man government."
mary chesnut.
from the southern
white house in richmond,
to keep the war effort
on track.
southern industry grew,
driven by necessity,
and the confederate
government,
founded on the principle
of decentralization,
found itself
controlling everything
from the forging of cannon
at the big tredegar
iron works in richmond
to the daily output
of the women
who spun cloth
for uniforms
in their parlors.
in charleston,
mary chesnut's circle
knit socks
for stonewall jackson's
entire brigade.
women wove boots
from palmetto fronds
and saved their urine
from which to distill
niter for gunpowder.
southerners grew poppies
to yield opium
and made coffee
from corn and peas,
hypodermic needles
from thorns,
rope from spanish moss.
but the confederate army
was shrinking.
the term of enlistment
for the earliest volunteers
was up in the spring.
most men
planned to go home.
in april, at the insistence
of jefferson davis,
the confederate congress
passed two laws--
one extended all enlistments
for the duration,
the other required
all able-bodied white men
between 18 and 35
to serve for 3 years.
it was the first national
draft in american history.
"the conscription act,
at one fell swoop,
"strikes down
the sovereignty
of the states,
"tramples upon
the constitutional rights
"and personal liberty
of the citizens,
and arms the president
with imperial powers."
governor joseph e. brown
of georgia.
"mrs. davis
is being utterly upset.
"she is beginning
"to hear the carping
and faultfinding
"to which the president
is subjected.
"there must
be an opposition
"in a free country,
but it is
very uncomfortable."
mary chesnut.
veterans were
especially resentful
because potential draftees
who owned 20 slaves or more
could be exempted.
"allowing every person
who owned 20 negroes
to go home.
"it gave us the blues.
"we wanted 20 negroes.
"orich man's war,
poor man's fight!
"from this time on
till the end of the war,
"a soldier was simply
a machine, a conscript.
"all our pride
and valor had gone,
"and we were sick of war
and cursed
the southern confederacy."
sam watkins.
nearly half the southerners
eligible for the new draft
failed to sign up.
"april 21.
"16 days have
now been spent
in this place.
"our grand army
has again come
to a halt.
"under
the dry pine leaves
where we encamp,
"a great secesh army
of wood ticks
have wintered.
"few are so happy
as not to find
"half a dozen
of these villainous
bloodsuckers
sticking
in his flesh
every morning."
chaplain
a.m. stewart.
"the firing from
the confederate lines
"was of little consequence,
"not amounting
to over 10 or 12
artillery shots each day,
"a number
of these being directed
at the huge balloon
which went up daily
from general fitz john's
headquarters."
"when about 100 feet
above the ground,
"and the general
sailed off
toward richmond
"at a greater speed
"than the army
of the potomac
is moving.
"he had
sufficient calmness
"to pull
the valve rope
and gradually
descended about
3 miles from camp."
on the peninsula,
general george mcclellan's
huge army
sat in front of the smaller
rebel force at yorktown
for almost a month.
it rained 2
out of every 3 days.
hundreds fell ill.
"i feel that
the fate of a nation
depends on me
"and that i have
not one single friend
at the seat
of government."
george mcclellan.
mcclellan had moved
more than 90 federal guns
to yorktown by may 3,
some so massive
that it took 100 horses
to haul them up
along hastily constructed
timber highways
called "cor-du-roi" roads.
mcclellan
finally decided to act
and carefully planned
a massive bombardment
for may 5.
but on the night
of the 3rd,
general magruder's
confederate batteries
suddenly intensified
their fire.
mcclellan braced
for an attack.
but the next morning,
the confederates
had vanished.
disbelieving
federal troops
edged into the deserted
southern camps.
magruder had packed up
his show and moved on,
but mcclellan declared it
a union victory.
"the success
is brilliant,
"and you may rest assured
"that its effects will be
of the greatest importance.
"there shall
be no delay
in following up
the rebels."
the union men now cautiously
followed the rebel army
west towards richmond.
"may 20.
"richmond is
just 9 miles off.
"the negroes are
delighted to see us,
"but the whites look
as if they would
like to kill us."
elisha hunt rhodes.
[bell tolling]
from mcclellan's lines,
you could hear the bells
of richmond tolling.
you could hear
he was that close.
a worried jefferson davis
now prepared
for a siege of richmond,
relying more and more
on the advice
of his close military
adviser, robert e. lee.
when davis asked
where lee thought
the south's next defensive
line should be drawn
once richmond fell,
lee said,
"richmond must not fall.
it shall not be given up."
still, george mcclellan
refused to attack.
though his army still
outnumbered the rebels,
he remained convinced
the opposite was true.
one observer noted
that mcclellan
had a particular faculty
for "realizing
hallucinations."
he demanded
another 40,000 men.
"if he had
a million men,
"he would swear
the enemy had
two millions,
"and then he would
sit down in the mud
and yell for 3."
edwin m. stanton.
with the year half gone,
the union's grand strategy
had stalled.
the western campaign
begun by u.s. grant
had ground to a halt
in north mississippi,
and mcclellan's
mighty forces
were paralyzed
in front of richmond.
there was worse to come.
the killing that would
soon break out in virginia
would continue all year
and come to a climax
along a tiny creek
in western maryland
called the antietam.
"we talk of
the irrepressible conflict
"and practically
give the lie to our talk.
"we wage war against
slaveholding rebels
"and yet protect
and augment the motive
"which has moved
the slaveholders
to rebellion.
"we strike
at the effect
"and leave
the cause unharmed.
"fire will not
burn it out of us,
"water cannot
wash it out of us,
"that this war
with the slaveholders
"can never be brought
to a desirable termination
"until slavery,
"the guilty cause of
all our national troubles,
has been totally
and forever abolished."
frederick douglass.
