You know, keep her straight...
Keep her level.
It's your first time up, so
don't do anything interesting.
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Remember, she stalls out
at about 100.
So keep the air speed up, otherwise
you'll be drifting around all over the skies.
- If the ailerons start to shimmy...
- Peevy, I have flown a plane or two in my life, you know.
Not like this one you haven't.
This one's a handful.
You sneeze in this thing and you're gonna
end up upside down in a bean field.
- That's fresh paint, damn it!
- Do you want me to crash?
Chewing gum ain't gonna keep
your butt up in the air.
You treat her nice, Clifford. She's gonna
take us all the way to the nationals.
- Let's make some history.
- Yeah.
Crank her up, Goose!
- Make her hot!
- Hot and brakes.
Hey, watch this, Peevy!
National air race
is the next stop, Peevy!
Hey, Fitch! You tryin' to save on ammo?
Nail 'em!
I can't get a clean shot. I wish that
black-and-white would get out of the way.
Careful what you wish for.
This is the 3rd car in a month.
Hoover'll be spittin' nails.
The heck with Hoover!
- There he is! Get outta my way. I can't see.
- Keep drivin'!
Quit movin'. You're
ruining my shot!
Get back. Get...
Let's go, Lenny.
We can't get caught with...
Lousy feds!
Somethin' ain't right.
Sorry, Lenny.
He's gettin' away.
Get it off!
- Get him out!
- Peevy!
Hit the latch! Hurry!
Get the hell outta there!
Where you goin'? Cliff!
You all right? You okay?
Well... that's the end of that!
- All right, get it outta here.
- Wait a minute.
You're chasing a couple of crooks
across our runway,
crash into my pilot,
and it's our fault?
No offence, pops, but we
got more important things to do...
than get all sweaty
about whose fault it was.
Listen here, buddy, building that plane
took three years and every cent we had.
File a claim with Uncle Sam.
Who knows, you could get lucky.
And wait six months... a year?
We made a livin' with that plane.
Well maybe it's time
to get a real job.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Relax! Relax! Relax!
You got that one free, kid. One more like that
and you'll be eatin' soft food for a month!
Yeah?
- Come on, let's go.
- Relax.
That fly boy hangs one on my kisser and
you let him waltz?
Maybe you had it comin'.
- We need a word with the patient.
- In private.
Your buddy's getting fitted
for a pine overcoat.
If you make it to County General,
Alcatraz is your new digs.
Spit it out, Wilmer.
Where's the package?
Blown to hell.
Why don't you go look for it?
- Get him outta here.
- Hey, Fitch?
Take a look at this.
That must be the gizmo, all right.
Okay, button it up.
- Call 'im, Wooly.
- Why me? I called last time.
But he likes you.
There's no mistake
about that, Wooly?
<i>I'm afraid not.
We got what's left of it.</i>
I see.
- It was damn sloppy.
<i>- It could've been worse. We got the gizmo.</i>
- Well yes, it could have been worse.
<i>- We'll take it right down to headquarters.</i>
Right.
Was that Wolinski?
They chased it to an
airstrip in the valley.
There was a wreck on the runway.
The X-3 was destroyed.
Better lost than
in the wrong hands.
- How soon can you rebuild it?
- Rebuild it?
Not a chance.
My people in Washington will have
something to say about that.
Your people in Washington want to turn
anything that flies into a weapon.
Apparently someone else
had the same idea.
Sir, I'm afraid we must insist.
I'll remind you boys that I
don't work for the government.
I cooperate at my discretion.
Two of my best pilots were
killed during the test phase.
God knows how many more men
would have died if it had flown.
No, gentlemen.
I'm sorry I ever dreamed
the damn thing up.
Sir, I wish you'd reconsider.
What do we tell the president?
Tell him the dream is over.
Tell him Howard Hughes said so.
What's this 300 gallons here?
We don't burn that much fuel
in two years, Bigelow!
You burned it in two seconds when my
fuel truck went up.
The truck's on there too.
It's all itemised.
Hey! Hey! I didn't blow up your truck.
The guy in the car did.
After bouncing off you.
Pilots are responsible
for a safe landing. You know that.
Where we gonna get this kind of dough, Bigelow?
We've gotta sell the Gee Bee for scrap!
I'm sorry. I hate to
kick you when you're down.
But business is business.
I'm out of pocket here.
Of course, I could always
use the old clown act.
We don't do the clown act
no more.
Peevy, Peevy, wait! It's
worth fifteen bucks a shot.
10 bucks a shot;
5 bucks goes toward your bill.
Think it over boys. See it my way
or see me in court.
The clown suit is
in the storeroom.
First show's at nine.
Don't be late.
Lousy nickel-nurser.
Clown act!
Good thinkin', Clifford!
You just set us back about four years.
Plus which "Miss Mabel" over here
is a flying coffin. You said so yourself.
Peevy, she never let us down before.
Besides, I'll go real easy on her.
Number five piston is shot, nothing
left of her but spit and baling wire.
I could fly a shoe box
if it had wings, Peev.
- Ow!
- What? What's the matter?
I don't know. There's somethin'
under this seat.
That's my duffel bag.
- What've you got in there?
- I don't know, but it's heavy.
- Peev, clean that table off.
- All right.
Open her up.
Oh, my! What've we got here?
Here, take the bag.
- That's a piece of work, isn't it?
- Yeah.
What do you suppose it is,
a bomb or somethin'?
Too complex to be a bomb.
I don't see any moving parts.
I wouldn't touch that
if I were you.
- The housing's still cool.
- Huh.
Runs on alcohol.
What's the damn thing for?
- Hold it, Peev.
- Huh?
Hold it!
Tip her over. Tip her over.
- Easy, easy!
- I got it.
Watch it.
What's goin' on, Sinclair?
Lenny is dead.
Wilmer's wrapped up like
a mummy in County General.
You didn't
play straight with me.
I'm sorry about your boys,
Eddie... truly.
- What went wrong?
- What went wrong? It's the feds that went wrong.
This was supposed to be a simple
snatch-and-grab. What the hell is going on?
I didn't say that it'd be simple, Eddy.
And snatch-and-grab is what
you're supposed to be good at.
That's what I pay you for.
Now where's the package?
Nothing's gonna happen with me
and my boys until you tell me...
exactly why this merchandise is
so important to the feds.
Send me a cheque.
- Let's get out of here, boys.
- It's a rocket.
A rocket?
Yeah... Like in the comic books.
- Now what happened to it?
- I don't know.
Wilmer knows. He's in
the hospital surrounded by cops.
- Maybe in a couple of days we get...
- We don't have a couple of days, Eddie!
What room's Wilmer in?
Mr. Movie Star!
He's gonna walk into the hospital with a smile
on his face and a handful of posies.
He's gonna charm
the feds to death.
That's not exactly
what I had in mind.
Who cares what you had in mind?
You don't need
my services any more.
You can take it from here.
I'll tell you what.
You pay me what you owe me
because you're half lunatic anyhow.
Yes, shoot!
I want that rocket, Eddie, not
next week, not tomorrow... now.
We have a deal?
You bring me that rocket
and I'll double your price.
You'll triple my price.
What's a movie star
need a rocket for anyway?
Bloody amateurs!
Yes.
<i>Lothar, I've got another job for you...</i>
<i>a condolence call.</i>
Come on, Peev.
Here goes.
Well, I'm lookin' at it
but I don't believe it.
- Peevy... the stake!
- Get down!
That thing'll cut you in half.
We lost it.
I told you I should have
tested it myself.
Yeah, you'd be halfway
to Kansas by now, you chowder head!
Turn her off! Turn her off!
Why, that must've woke up
the whole valley.
Pick her up. Come on,
let's get out of here.
Peevy, you'd pay to see
a man fly, wouldn't you?
Ha!
- You've gotta be outta your mind.
- I'm talkin' about making some real money here, Peevy.
Not just 10 bucks a show but enough to get
us back on our feet and into the nationals.
Are your eyes painted on, Clifford? This thing is like
strapping nitroglycerine to your back.
- Besides, the feds are mixed up in this.
- I don't want to keep it.
I just want to borrow it
for a while.
Clifford, when you borrow something and don't
tell nobody, they call that stealing, you know.
Just a couple of weeks. As soon as we can afford
a new plane, we'll give it back, I swear.
Clifford, did you see what
this thing did back there?
You're always telling me what
a genius you are, Peev! Fix it.
We're gonna need
one hell of a lawyer.
I think we're gonna
need a helmet.
Whose is it?
Yours.
'Evening, Miss Pye.
You know my rules;
no gentlemen after 6:00 p.m.
- Well, I'm no gentleman.
- You can say that again.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Good night, Mrs. Pye.
- Have a good time, dear.
If he tries anything, deck him.
And don't forget the curfew.
- I lock up at 11:00 sharp.
- Yes, warden.
Cliff, guess what?
I think I got the part.
- That's great.
- I won't know for sure 'til tomorrow, but...
the director said he
liked my reading the best.
- Oh, you mean you have lines this time.
- Just one.
- But it's to Neville Sinclair.
- Okay!
Let's hear it.
"Oh, my prince.
"Would that you'd
drink of my lips as deeply."
And then he kisses you?
No. He's too busy
killing someone.
- Now you tell me.
- What?
The maiden voyage.
How'd she fly?
She flew great.
Landing had a few bumps.
Hey, we'd better scram if we're
gonna catch this Cagney movie.
Uh-uh-uh. It's my turn to pick.
Uh-oh.
There's a new
Neville Sinclair movie.
Oh, Jen, you know
Cagney's better.
I mean, come on! You won't catch Cagney
lounging around his penthouse in his underwear,
walking poodles in the park,
or doing any of...
Or getting shot down
behind enemy lines?
- What are you talking about?
- The movie,
"Wings of Honour."
- Neville Sinclair?
- Uh-huh.
Oh, brother.
This I gotta see.
<i>Herr Hitler assures the western powers</i>
<i>he is not massing troops at the Czech border.</i>
<i>Here comes the Fuhrer's latest
symbol of German progress,</i>
<i>the airship "Luxembourg,"
beginning its American tour...</i>
<i>- to promote world peace.</i>
- World peace!
What he means is
a piece of the world!
Excuse me.
<i>...on the first stop of
their goodwill tour.</i>
- Their last goodwill tour buried half of Europe.
- Shh.
<i>...and its technological marvels. Though
filled with explosive hydrogen gas...</i>
Your Gee Bee could fly
circles around that thing.
<i>After the short visit, it was
into the clouds to continue a journey...</i>
<i>that will carry the Luxembourg
to Chicago, St. Louis,</i>
<i>across the Rockies
and finally to Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Look us up, boys,
when you get to Hollywood.</i>
Who's there? Who is it?
- What do you want?
- Where is it?
- Where's what?
- The rocket.
I don't answer to nobody
but Eddie Valentine.
Okay, okay, okay! Ease off! Ease off!
I pulled a switch, see. I got
the package stashed real good.
It's at the airfield, hangar 3.
It's in some old plane.
- Hey, open this door.
- Hey, are you okay?
What is it? What happened?
And then,
get this, fellas,
at the end of the movie...
he flies over enemy trenches
and drops a bottle of champagne.
And let me guess. It hits the general
and we win the war, right?
It was symbolic.
He was being chivalrous.
Where'd he get the champagne? They didn't
have liquor stores at the front, did they?
Not that I recall.
Would've been nice though...
It doesn't matter where he got it from.
That's not the point.
It's just...
Forget it.
Malcolm, the wheel came off.
Oh, let me see, princess.
Sure. Sure, we'll fix her up.
Did I ever tell you about the time
I got shot down by the Red Baron?
No? Oh.
Well there I was flying over
the Ardennes on patrol...
when all of a sudden he comes screaming
out of the sun, guns blazing.
And then, smack!
- Bull's-eye, ace.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
Oh, it's okay, Malcolm.
Thanks, Cliff.
You know, Cliff,
Once in a while it wouldn't hurt to try
someplace new, maybe away from the airfield.
Like where? The Copa?
The Brown Derby?
Why not the South Seas Club
while you're dreamin'.
Okay, how 'bout this.
We'll go out have a real
night on the town...
after you win the nationals.
Yeah, swell, after I win the nationals.
You gonna fly
in the nationals after all?
Well, glad to hear it after
that landing today.
How about a warm-up, Malcolm?
You said there were a few bumps.
Boy, I'll say. She folded like a kite
when she hit the runway.
We thought old Cliffie's number
was up, what with the fire and all.
I was gonna tell ya.
I didn't want to ruin
your evening.
Thank you. It's very thoughtful of you.
You'd rather make a fool of me?
I'm sorry.
I don't want you to be sorry, Cliff.
I want you to stop treating me
like... like a stranger.
When something goes wrong,
I should be the first one to know about it.
I shouldn't be the last.
Jen, everyone knows because
they were at the airfield.
I had an audition.
It was important to me.
I understand.
Just like the last time
when I flew the regionals.
You got a big part. You stood
behind Myrna Loy with a bowl of grapes.
Good night, Millie.
Thank you for the soup.
Well,
go after her, you dope.
Jenny!
Cliff, I, uh...
- I'm sorry, I really stuck...
- Malcolm, it's okay.
It's all right. It's not your fault.
- Well, did you have a good time?
- Yeah.
Go ahead and stick that
welding torch in my ear.
We'll call it the end
of a perfect day.
What're you two
scrappin' about this time?
I don't know, Peev.
I just can't figure
this girl out.
I mean, she hangs around with this
Hollywood crowd all day, talking about...
talkin' about movie stars
and nightclubs...
So what? That's her work. She don't care about them
phoney-baloneys. She cares about you.
I want her to think
I'm makin' something of myself, Peev,
Not that I'm just an out-of-work
pilot with holes in his pockets.
You got a good thing
goin' with that girl, Clifford.
But if she flies the coop,
I'm tellin' you right now...
it's gonna be your fault.
What do you know
about women, Peev?
You haven't had a date
since 1932.
Flora Maxwell.
There was no point
in datin' nobody after her.
He's got to be kidding!
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were a sporting man.
True. I'd hate to stain my
legend on a villain such as you.
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.
Why wait?
Good heavens! It's Sir Reginald!
None other!
Oh, my prince,
would that you'd drink
of my lips as deeply.
Cut! Cut! Cut!
Back to first positions.
Good lord! Fixer, how many times
are we gonna have to do this?
Sweetheart, acting is acting
like you're not acting.
So act... but don't act
like you're acting. Get it?
- All right.
- Why don't we try that?
Boy oh boy. Is she a block of wood!
You know, your audition was so much better.
Irma, everybody's audition was better! Does it matter
when you're the producer's niece?
So she gets a scene with Neville Sinclair
and we play scenery.
- I love Hollywood.
- All right everybody, positions.
And please, let's try to
get it right this time.
"Laughing Bandit,"
scene 114, take 28.
And... action!
What? Kill me as I stand?
I thought you were
a sporting man.
True. I'd hate to stain my legend
on a villain such as you.
Prepare to die that we may learn
the identity of the Laughing Bandit.
- Why wait?
- Good heavens! It's Sir Reginald!
None other.
Oh, my prince, would that
you'd drink of my lips as deeply.
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Jenny Blake.
Oh, Jenny... Jenny Blake.
Does anyone know a Jenny Blake?
Cut.
- I hope he's okay.
- Where's Mr. Sinclair?
Give us a hand with this flat, will ya?
- You okay, Mr. Sinclair?
- It's all right. I'm fine.
Well never let it be said Neville Sinclair
failed to bring down the house.
Somebody call the nurse!
Charlie's been stabbed!
Charlie!
Charlie.
Oh my God, forgive me, Charlie.
I had no idea.
Did you think I was
stealing the scene?
Don't talk. Don't even move.
John. Get my car and driver.
Get him to The Queen of Angels.
Gladys, you ride with him. I'll have
my personal physician meet you there.
Victor, come here.
This is supposed to be
a closed set... no visitors!
I want that... Jenny
banned from the lot.
Jenny, Jenny, I said I'm sorry.
- Look, I just want to patch things up.
- You're off to a great start.
Look Jenny. Something really big has happened
and I want you to be the first to know.
- I'm listening.
- Me and Peevy found something...
that's gonna get us
right back on our feet.
What do you mean, you found something?
It's an engine, okay, but you
strap it to your back...
and it makes you fly
without wings.
You knocked down half
the castle to tell me about an engine?
You're always saying
you're the last to know.
Cliff, I meant
the important things.
- This is important.
- And so is this acting job.
- Acting?
- Yes, acting.
Honey, you're walking
through the scenery here.
That's not fair.
This is a good job.
The director thinks
I'm talented.
What's this?
Pay voucher. The director
wants you off the picture.
- You know this is a closed set.
- I have to go.
Come on, come on, come on. You know
what a closed set means, pal?
Hey!
- Fixer, where's that girl I told you to fire?
- I fired her.
Hello. I'm Neville Sinclair.
- You must be...
- Jenny Blake.
I... I'd hate to think...
that I may have been... I'm responsible
for your having been dismissed.
- Will you stay?
- But it's... really my fault, Mr. Sinclair.
Have you read for the part
of the Saxon princess?
No.
I think you might be rather
wonderful in the role.
I'll see that you do. Perhaps
we could discuss it over dinner.
I've got a regular table at the South Seas Club
if you're not too bored with the South Seas club.
- I'd love to Mr...
- Neville.
- Neville.
- Tonight then.
Okay, let's get all the
atmosphere over here.
Hey ladies in waiting?
We're waiting! Let's go.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Travelair Mystery Ship
has just taken over the lead from 4.</i>
<i>We have clocked him at
192 miles per hour.</i>
Programs! Programs! Five cents one program!
- Here you are. Thank you.
- Malcolm.
- I sold seven.
- Good. Here, honey, some more.
Programs! Programs!
<i>As you can see, folks, Miss Los
Angeles is trailing badly.</i>
<i>Just this morning she was down
with some mechanical problems...</i>
<i>- and she may be in trouble.</i>
- Park it away from the runway.
- What's wrong with that kid? I told him 9:00.
- He'll be here.
If he ain't in the air in 5 minutes,
you guys find a new hangar.
<i>Bernie Howard in the red
Great Lakes Biplane...</i>
<i>is really pouring it on now.
He's runnin' 3rd but he's movin'!</i>
<i>This could end up
in a three-way heat.</i>
I know what Wilmer told Sinclair's goon,
but the rocket ain't in hangar three.
There's an old plane in there all right
but the only thing in it was this.
- Nice. That's it?
- We searched this place from hell to breakfast.
I want you to start over. Search it again,
turn it inside out, and upside down.
Keep your eyes open
for this dame.
She might be the one who knows where this
guy is who found our package, all right.
Okay, Eddie, all right. You heard
Mr. Donald then. Let's go.
<i>To dazzle you with an exhibition
of great sureflying skills...</i>
<i>is Cliff Secord, the Fearless Freep.
And there he goes!</i>
That's not the routine!
What the hell is
Secord trying to pull?
Thanks a lot, Bigelow. I'm two minutes late.
Who'd you put up in Miss Mabel?
- Five cents, one buffalo! Get your program!
- That's gotta be Malcolm up there.
Flag that biplane down now!
Peev, he hasn't been behind the stick
in 25 years. What's he doin' up there?
He's tryin' to save your job, Cliff. But if he drifts
into those race lanes he's gonna kill somebody.
Oh, no.
The rocket's in the tool chest, right?
Yeah.
Why?
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we have an emergency.</i>
<i>We have an emergency!
Please clear the field.</i>
- Please clear the fie...
- What, are you outta your mind?
Ladies and gentlemen, well, I guess
we had you fooled for a minute.
Clifford!
But it's all part of the show.
Stay in your seats, please.
- What are you doin'?
- What's it look like I'm doing? Come on, give me a hand.
No, Cliff, no! For God's sake,
we haven't tested it enough.
- Look what she did to Lucky Lady...
- Peevy, cut it out, cut it out!
I'm scared enough as it is.
Okay. Okay, listen.
I reworked the throttle,
so just squeeze her like a gas pedal.
And if you want to stop,
mash down hard and let go.
Okay.
- Anything else?
- Yeah.
A little luck.
- How do I look?
- Like a hood ornament.
Look at that!
Johnny!
Tell me that you're gettin' this.
I'm gettin' it. I'm gettin' it. I don't
know what it is, but I'm gettin' it.
- Malcolm!
- Aaah!
Malcolm?
Malcolm, wake up.
Malcolm, it's me, Cliff.
Wake up! Wake up, Malcolm, come on!
Ohh! Whoa!
Don't worry, folks.
It's all part of the show.
Oh, nooo!
Malcolm! Malcolm, wake up.
Malcolm, wake up!
I'll get you. Get up! Get out of here.
It's all part of the show.
He's going west!
He's going west!
Go, go, go! Get out of the way!
- Hey Charlie, get off the phone!
- You heard me... a flying man!
- Hold the front page!
- Yeah, that's what I said, a rocket man!
Oh, no!
Whoa! Aaah!
Whoa!
Watch it!
Big gopher.
Oh, no!
- Cliff!
- Huh?
I like it!
What in the hell
is the matter with you?
Are you trying to kill yourself?
We don't know how long this thing
stays up, how much fuel's in her...
If you wanna look around you gotta use
your eyeballs. This thing's got a rudder on it.
If you turn your head,
you change course. Hear what I'm sayin'?
Boy, you banged that up pretty good. I don't
know if I'm gonna be able to fix that.
Peevy, you can fix anything.
Well... uh-oh! We got company.
Must be the news boys.
- You put on quite a show.
- They can't find out who we are, Peevy.
Whoever owns this is gonna want it back,
and I'm just gettin' the hang of it.
- Peevy, put it in neutral.
- What?
Put it in neutral!
You steer, I'll push.
Get in the car.
How 'bout some background
on the flyin' man?
- Yeah, give it to us.
- What's his name?
Sorry, boys. It's a trade secret...
all part of the mystery.
- Why don't you call him Rocket Boy?
- That's lousy!
- What about Rocket Man?
- That's worse.
- What about Missile Man?
- That stinks.
Come on, Bigelow,
give us a better name.
How about Rocketeer?
- Bingo!
- That'll work. Rocketeer it is.
Extra, extra!
Man flies without plane!
Extra, extra! Read all about it!
- It's so romantic.
- I bet he's handsome.
I wish he'd rescue me.
Extra, extra!
All right, ready on the set.
Let's go everybody. Let's shoot.
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Thanks to the diligence
of the FBI,
this particular vacuum cleaner
will not fall into the wrong hands.
Mr. Bigelow, FBI.
We'd like a word with you.
- Must be the maid's day off.
- Somebody's been lookin' for something.
Give me some light, Fitch.
Mother of mercy!
He's been folded in half.
Looks like he was
writin' something.
1635...
Palm Terrace.
If the vertical thrust is
1-28 inches per second...
Cliff?
What do you want?
- What are you doin' here? Get out of here.
- Peevy!
Cliff, get me out!
Peevy!
Slats, Murphy, come with us.
Murph, wait here
for the high sign.
Where is it?
Where's what?
The rocket!
Sure you got the right house?
Secord, Peabody! Open up! FBI.
Get down!
Let 'em have it, boys.
Cliff? Cliff!
Cliff?
- Clifford!
- Peevy!

Well, let me introduce you.
Miss Jenny Blake,
- Mr. W. C. Fields.
- Charmed, my dear,
doubly-charmed.
- Jenny, what a euphonious appellation.
- Thank you.
Jenny, excuse me for a moment. I won't
be long. Bill, look please look after her.
I thought you'd
never ask. Scram.
My little kumquat,
I'm fully prepared...
to listen to your life story.
Yeah okay, I'll tell him.
Spanish Johnny... he's checking
on the diner where the flyers hang out.
All right, Stevie.
Make me a Bromo, will you?
What do you want?
Everything okay?
We treatin' you good?
Get to the point Eddie. I'm busy.
- Have you found the rocket?
- Busy, huh?
My guys are tearing up the
town looking for that rocket...
and you're busy...
romancin' some dame.
That dame... happens to be
Secord's girlfriend.
Good. She'll tell us
where Secord is.
My boys'll get the truth
out of her in two minutes.
Valentine... we're gonna do
what I think is necessary.
And that includes breakin'
one of my men in half?
Next time you go after one of my men,
I'll kill you.
Don't threaten me Eddie.
Just do your job.
Hey, Sinclair...
If the feds get me I'm takin' you with me.
I'm gonna tell 'em everything.
Who do you think they'd believe?
A cheap crook or the number 3
box-office star in America?
Number 3 jerk!
<i>The helmeted mystery
man disappeared into the Baldwood Hills...</i>
<i>moments after the daring rescue and has
yet to step forward and identify himself.</i>
<i>But air circus owner, Otis Bigelow,
promises his bird man will return.</i>
<i>Until then, all of Los Angeles is buzzing.
Who is the Rocketeer?</i>
<i>And now, back to our program
of dance band favourites.</i>
Okay. Here's the plan.
We call the FBI...
we get rid of this damned thing.
Peevy, the FBI's gonna lock us up.
They think we were shooting at them. What
do you think was going on at the house?
House? We don't got a house, Clifford.
We got a gazebo.
Between the FBI and
that King Kong gentleman,
we're gonna get ourselves
killed over this thing.
Peevy?
Peevy open up.
We just come from the airfield.
It's Bigelow.
- What about him?
- His office is crawling with cops.
Somebody tore up his place
like they were looking for something.
- Yeah, so?
- They killed him.
Cliff, what's going on?
I'll make the call.
<i>FBI, Los Angeles.
Agent Morris speaking.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
- Uh, yeah. I'll be home soon, honey.
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- I love you too.
<i>- Okay, wise guy.</i>
What can I do for you gents?
Madam, we're looking for a pilot
by the name of Cliff Secord.
Does anybody here know him?
Haven't seen him around.
See, we need a flier
for a real special job.
There's a lot of lettuce
in this.
What do you say
we lay out a finder's fee?
How 'bout it, dad?
Secord! Oh, yeah, I know him.
Short fella, gimpy leg.
Didn't he move to Cincinnati?
Cincinnati.
How 'bout you, bub?
You know this Secord?
If you boys aren't ordering,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
We'll order! We'll order! Let's see.
How 'bout those pies?
They look good, huh, boys?
Mmm! Betcha they're home-made.
Don't interrupt his meal.
Yeah, I like coffee with my pie.
You know, that was funny.
I don't like music
while I'm digesting.
Listen, friend, we told you,
we don't know where he is.
Okay, pop, maybe we
can refresh your memory.
Come on. Follow me.
Take a good look...
- 'cause you're next.
- All right?
- Talk, dad, or get a facial.
- Drop dead, you weasel.
- I told you once, I don't know where the hell he is.
- Yeah?
Leave him alone!
Naughty boy.
- Please leave him alone. Stop!
- Better start talkin', pops.
- Startin' to smoke, old timer.
- Stop it!
Hold it.
Jenny. Lookie here, boys.
Lady Luck left her phone number.
Mine!
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>
This is the florist.
I've got a lovely bouquet
of flowers here for Jenny.
Who sent her flowers?
Cliff Secord.
- Oh, is that right?
<i>- That's right.</i>
Well, tell him he's too late...
because she's gone to the South Seas
Club with Mr. Neville Sinclair.
<i>Hello?</i>
Hello?
Come here.
Chris, you're not gonna believe this.
Guess where the dish went.
Where?
With the limey to
the South Seas Club.
What do you think? Fancy-pants
is pullin' a fast one on Eddie?
I don't know,
but I don't like this.
Jeff, you and Mikey stay here and
watch who walks into this joint.
- Boys, been a pleasure.
- I'll call from the club.
All right, Johnny.
We'll take care of it.
All right everybody,
relax and take it easy.
We're gonna be here a while.
Hey mom, how 'bout
a fresh pot of coffee?
Swell outfit, dad.
Hey!
Here's Mr. Ketchup Bottle!
Hey, that's quite
a dish you got there.
Hey wait a minute. That's Lady Luck!
- Get the gun!
- I got it, I got it!
Billy, I'm sorry about all this.
I'll fix everything. I promise.
Clifford, what's the deal?
Are you nuts?
Cliff, no! Not again.
Peevy, half the city
is looking for us.
Now I can fly to that nightclub in
five minutes and nobody can follow me.
Take a cab.
The only place this thing is going is back
to the feds. We had an agreement, son!
Look! Peev, I'm sorry.
I should've listened to you from the start,
but Jenny's in trouble now.
And that girl means more
to me than...
I love her, Peev.
- Does she know that?
- She's gonna find out.
You promise me one thing, when she's safe
this thing goes back!
Brother, you got my word on that.
I'm sorry I laid eyes on this thing.
You might want this.
I'll meet you back here.
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it,
you're leaking like a sieve here.
You must've picked up a ricochet. If you'd
hit that button, we'd go all over the map by now.
- Can you fix it?
- I could if I had a couple of hours.
Peevy, we don't have a couple of minutes!
Come on, we need something quick.
Let's see if our luck's
still holdin'.
Go on!
- All right Peevy, stand clear.
- What was that?
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
It's so elegant.
You make it so. Here's to you...
and to the extraordinary way
your face catches the light.
You must let me have this dance.
There's no music.
Really?
I hear music.
That's Neville Sinclair.
One day, Jenny, a man will look
into those eyes and he'll drown...
and never be saved.

♪ Who cares for starlit skies ♪

Hey.
- Is it something I said?
- No. No, it's nothing.
Oh, Jenny, I know
that look all too well.
- Is it your boyfriend?
- I'm sorry, Neville.
It's just that Cliff and I talked
about coming here so many times.
Tell me about him.
At least give me a chance
to know the competition.
Well...
he's a little rough
around the edges.
He can be pretty thoughtless sometimes.
And then he can be the
sweetest guy in the world.
He gave me these little
oranges when we first met.
- How nice.
- My family has a small farm and
Cliff was coming through our town,
dusting the groves.
- He's a flier?
- Yeah. He flies racing planes like this one.
At least he did until yesterday.
- He was almost killed.
- What happened?
We didn't order anything. Go on.
Yes, sir. A fan of yours
sent some soup over.
Go on. You were saying?
It was very silly.
He completely missed the runway.
I don't know why the
real pilots even let him fly.
I see. At least I'm beginning to feel
a bit better about the competition.
Have you worked here long?
Oh, yes.
I waited on you last time.
So... um...
where is he now?
He's probably hatching
some harebrained scheme.
Now he has an engine.
Says you strap it on your back and...
I'm sorry.
- You idiot!
- How clumsy of me.
Go and get something
to clean this up.
Yes.
- I'm sorry, Jenny.
- Will you just excuse me for a minute?
No, please stay.
- No no, sit down. It's...
- Don't worry about them, I'll be right back.
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing here?
- Will you just listen to me for a minute.
- You're jealous. You found out that I was here with Neville...
No, I'm not jealous!
Listen, Jenny, Bigelow's been murdered.
Murdered?
You remember at the studio what I
told you about the rocket we found?
Well the people that are looking for it
murdered Bigelow to get to me.
Now they're after you. They have
your picture, the one from the Gee Bee.
Jenny, prepare yourself
for a shock.
I'm the Rocketeer.
The rocka-who?
For cryin' out loud!
Haven't you read the papers?
- No, I've been working all day.
- It's them!
The guys with the snapshot.
You gotta get out of here.
I want you to get in a cab right now,
go to your mom's in Redlands...
and stay there until you
hear from me, okay?
Give me one good reason
why I should believe any of this?
Because if anything ever happened to you,
I'd go out of my mind. I swear I would.
Oh.
Go on, scram, get out of here.
And don't let them see you.
Thank you.
Taxi!
That's him.
Now go get him!
Cutting in.
Thank you!
He's in the laundry room.
Hit it! Hit it!
The laundry chute!
Get him! Get him!
Excuse me! Coming through!
Excuse me please!
- It's the flying man.
- It's the Rocketeer.
- Lock the doors. We'll trap him like a fly.
- Right. Lock the doors!
He's heading for the door.
Get the rocket!
Don't go, Jenny.
Our evening's just begun.
Welcome to my home.
Here.
It's the chloroform.
The effects will pass
in a moment.
Do you have to drug all
your women to seduce them?
You're part of this.
You kidnapped me.
Against my will, believe me.
I'm as much a victim as you are.
They're blackmailing me. These
are brutal ruthless men, Jenny.
Neville, I'm scared.
Oh, there, there, there.
Don't be frightened.
Tonight when we danced,
I felt something move inside me.
I felt it tear loose
and take flight.
You said that to Greta Garbo...
in "Napoleon's Mistress".
But you'd have been a fantastic
Lady Catherine.
If you'd put yourself...
completely into my hands,
I could teach you, mould you
into a leading lady;
clay... in the hands
of the master sculptor.
"Moonlight on Broadway".
Carole Lombard.
The scene on the top
of the Empire State Building.
Yes.
Look, you can't be comfortable
in that gown.
They're beautiful.
What am I doing?
You kidnapped me.
I'm so confused.
I don't know what to think.
Do you want me to try this on?
Desperately.
Neville?
Could you come in here, please?
Can you help me?
I finally played a scene
with Neville Sinclair.
Hello? Hello!
Can anyone hear me?
This is an emergency.
Can you hear me?
<i>Sinclair? Sinclair, is it you?</i>
<i>Why did you call?</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>
My God! Neville Sinclair is a...
A what?
Spy?
Saboteur?
A fascist?
All of the above.
Lothar.
Millie?
Peevy!
Hey, Peev?
Hey, Cliff!
Are you okay?
Patsy, you scared the livin'...
heck outta me.
Sorry.
- Peev?
<i>- Wrong. This Secord?</i>
- Who is this?
- Nevermind.
- Wanna talk to your girlfriend?
<i>- She's safe out of town by now.</i>
- Cliff is that you?
<i>- Jenny, baby where are you?</i>
<i>What are they doin' to you?</i>
That's enough. Just to let
you know we're serious.
You wanna see your girlfriend,
you gotta bring us the rocket.
Write this down. Griffith Observatory,
4 a.m., by the statues.
And come alone or we're gonna
have to kill the girl.
Cliff, what's happening?
- What are they doing to Jenny?
- Quiet, Patsy! I gotta think.
Patsy, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at ya.
Look. You remember the guy
who saved Malcolm today?
- The Rocketeer?
- Yeah. He's gonna help me find Jenny.
Freeze! FBI.
Remember me?
All I did was bypass the pressure valve
and that solved your throttle problem.
But adding a rudder to the helmet...
that was ingenious.
Nothin' to it, Howard.
Just basic aviation.
We've got so much on you, we're
gonna make your life miserable, buddy.
Good to see you, son.
- You too, pal.
- This is all he had on him.
There's no sign of the rocket.
He must've ditched it somewhere,
but he ain't talkin'.
Wooly, take off the handcuffs.
- You know who I am?
- What pilot doesn't, Mr. Hughes?
I designed the Cirrus X-3,
the rocket pack.
It was stolen from my factory.
I didn't take it.
Clifford, I told him everything that happened
and he believed it. Give the man his rocket.
- I can't do that. Not yet.
- Clifford, we agreed to give it back...
to its rightful owner.
That's him.
Secord, I don't think you know
the game you're playing.
Go ahead, roll it.
The German prototype had
the same problem as our first design.
The combustion chamber
would overheat and explode.
My boys finally figured it out:
a double-walled chamber
into which the fuel is pumped,
cool the chamber and preheat
the fuel at the same time.
The German experiment didn't
seem like much to worry about.
But when we got our hands on this next
film, we realized the scope of their plan.
Keep watching, kid. It cost a man's
life to get this out of Germany.
A NEW BEGINNING
TODAY EUROPE, TOMORROW THE WORLD
Where's my rocket pack, Secord?
You gotta let me use it
one more time.
I'm tired of square
dancing with you, kid.
I could slap you with grand theft, treason,
espionage, and that's just my short list.
- Wooly, give me the cuffs.
- No, look, they got my girl.
Oh, God, Cliff, no!
Yeah, they set up a rendezvous.
They want to swap Jenny for the rocket.
Look, kid, I understand how you feel,
but you gotta let us handle this.
I gotta go alone
or they're gonna kill her.
I'll give your rocket back.
Tomorrow. I swear.
Hey, this ain't a negotiation.
Those guys are playing for keeps.
- I can handle Valentine.
- The Valentine gang is only hired muscle.
They're working
for a Nazi agent,
someone we think is highly
placed in Hollywood society,
someone our intrepid G-men
have been unable to identify.
- It's Neville Sinclair.
- What?
It's Neville Sinclair.
- Come on!
- Yeah, sure. It makes perfect sense.
That's why he was bossing Eddie's men around
at the South Seas Club. That's why he has Jenny.
Nice try, kid. We're taking him
downtown and we're locking him up.
We'll take it from here, Mr. Hughes.
Let's go, kid.
No guns!
The son of a bitch will fly.
- Here. Put this on.
- I'd rather freeze.
You're right.
I prefer you like that.
Cheer up, Eddie. You're about to
make yourself a fortune.
Yeah, well that's good 'cause I got a club
to repair and an ulcer to plug.
Hey, boss! Here he comes.
Jenny, you okay?
She's fine!
I wasn't talkin' to you.
Take the rocket off...
carefully.
First you let her go.
The rocket, Secord!
Come on, kid, hand it over
so we can all go home.
What's it like working for
a Nazi, Eddie? Huh?
He pay you in dollars
or Deutsche Marks?
- What's he talking about?
- Oh yeah, I got it straight from the feds, Eddie.
Nazi spy ring, flying commandos,
the works.
Kid's been flying
where the air is too thin.
Ask him about the secret room.
Ask him about the Germans on the radio.
- Relax, Frankenstein. You ain't bullet proof.
- Talk fast, Sinclair.
- You tell him, Eddie.
- Shut up!
Come on, Eddie.
I'm paying you well.
Does it matter who I work for?
It matters to me.
I may not make an honest buck,
but I'm 100% American.
And I don't work
for no two-bit Nazi.
Let her go.
Storm Department!
Attack!
- In position! Come forward!
- Move, move! Listen up!
It's your move, Eddie.
- Seize the rocket! Quickly!
- Yes sir!
Keep them at bay.
Good-bye, Eddie.
Happy Valentine's Day.
This is the FBI!
Throw down your guns.
It's the feds!
- Shoot him!
- No!
Lousy krauts! Let 'em have it!
Careful. He's got the girl!
Watch out for that Zeppelin.
It's full of hydrogen.
One bad shot and we'll all fry.
Come on, boys.
We got 'em on the run.
- My lord...
- Get this ship out of range.
- Fast!
- Understood.
Don't you have the rocket?
Answer me!
Answer me! Where's the rocket?
We've got the girl.
The rocket will come to us.
We're losing 'em.
Maybe not. Look!
Up on the dome. It's him!
It's the Rocketeer.
Go get 'em, kid.
- What is wrong?
- The rudder.
- Something is wrong with the rudder.
- Dear God!
So what? Where is he?
Are you crazy, Sinclair?
What's with the lady?
Keep your mouth shut!
You're ignoring me.
I have my post and you too.
Do not worry, Herr Sinclair.
My pilot is the
finest in Germany.
We are in very capable hands.
He will not let us down.
Lothar.
This is your fault.
We are losing altitude.
We must drop some weight.
You, you... actor!
For the fatherland.
Yes.
Come!
Hurry up! Up there is a man.
- Go!
- Yes.
Herr Sinclair...
I've had a bellyful of you
and your cheap heroics.
Hand over the rocket or I'll
blow her brains... all over the cabin.
No! Don't give it to him.
Cliff, you can't!
I have to.
Captain, Sir!
Slide it.
If she moves, kill her.
Where's your stuntman now, Sinclair?
I do my own stunts.
Stop!
No! No!
For God's sakes, Sinclair.
Help us get these flames out.
Good-bye, Jenny.
I wish I could take you with me.
Everything about you is a lie.
It wasn't lies, Jenny.
It was acting.
I'll miss Hollywood.
I don't think so.
Jenny, this thing's full of hydrogen.
When the fire hits the envelope...
I love you, Cliff.
Run, Jenny!
Steady as she goes, Howard.
We're only gonna get one pass at this.
- Drop the ladder.
- Right.
Jump for it, Clifford!
Let's get outta here!
- Hi, Millie.
- Hey, morning, Millie, how you doing?
Morning, boys.
"Film fans were saddened
by the news...
"that actor Neville Sinclair
was killed in the tragedy...
"when flaming debris fell on
his touring car."
That's terrible.
That was a nice car.
You look awful blue for a guy
who pretty much saved the world.
Yeah, well, I guess I got the
cracked ribs to prove it.
You got me.
She's a beauty, Mr. Hughes.
Isn't she?
In another month, she'll
be ready for the nationals.
Miss Blake, will you excuse us
for just a moment?
Of course.
I've been meaning to ask you,
what was it like...
strapping that thing to your back
and flying like a bat out of hell?
It was the closest I'll ever
get to heaven, Mr. Hughes.
Well... maybe not.
See you around, Rocketeer.
Oh... don't ever fly her without this.
Isn't it pretty?
I didn't even get
a chance to thank him.
You don't have to, son.
He saw the look on your face.
Cliff, I have something for you too.
Actually... it's for Peevy.
Oh, no!
What was that line again?
"Oh, my prince..."
- "would that you'd drink of my lips..."
- Thanks.
I don't mind if I do.
Clifford, take a look
at this here. Here, look.
I bet if we increase
the manifold pressure up about 25%...
and then switch the
fuel-to-air ratio...
just favouring the fuel. Just a little...
Hey, Goose! You wanna
take a look at here?
Rocketeer to the rescue!
