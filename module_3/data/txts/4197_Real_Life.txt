Hello....
and Welcome.
I知 Councilman Edmund Harris
of the fifth district.
[ Applauding ]
I知 sure some of you know we're
gathered here this afternoon...
to dedicate the beginning
of a year long project:
to make a movie right here
in Phoenix and the outlying areas,
and much of it
in our own fifth district.
[ Applause ]
The fifth district is the home of
our good friends, the Yeager family:
Warren, Jeanette,
cute little Lisa and Eric.
And they're going to be
the stars of this unusual movie.
- [ Murmuring ]
- Wait a minute.
ALL of us are going to have an
important part in the picture too.
My wife tells me
I知 not handsome enough...
to be in the movies.
But our guest of honor
here today says that's baloney.
He's the gentleman
behind the whole thing.
Quite a gentleman
he is.
Why, he's made me
laugh on...
''The Tonight Show,''
the late Ed Sullivan.
J know you've seen his short films
on NBC's ''Good Night Saturday. ''
A lot of you have seen him on
your favorite shows, I知 sure.
And if you like the food
we had today, you have him to thank.
So would you please Welcome
with a big Phoenix applause,
all the way from
Hollywood, California,
Mr. Albert Brooks !
Thank you,
Councilman Harris.
Please tell the mayor
l wish him a speedy recovery.
l couldn't help noticing some
expressions of shock or disbelief,
or whatever it was
you were doing,
when the councilman mentioned
that the Yeagers...
were going to be the stars
of a major motion picture.
Many of you know Warren Yeager
is a fine veterinarian...
and not
a professional actor.
But that's exactly
the point.
We're gathered here this afternoon
to film Warren and his family,
and you folks
and ourselves as well,
because we're making a movie
about reality.
I知 sure you've had the experience
of coming out of a theater...
and saying, ''l've had more
interesting things happen to me...
''than happened to those
characters in that picture.
My life is
much more interesting.''
You know something ?
You're right.
The most hilarious Comedy,
the most gripping drama,
the most
suspenseful disasters,
they don't happen
on the movie screen.
They happen in my backyard
and yours.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
So, please, just remember
two simple words...
and everything
will be perfect.
Be yourselves.
lf you see one of our cameramen
following Warren or Jeanette,
or one of the children
into your homes or your offices...
or cleaning establishments
or gas stations,
don't try to do
anything special.
lt's tempting to show off
for the camera.
l know.
l make my living that way.
But in this case,
we don't want a show.
Let me correct myself.
We want the greatest
show of all: life !
Hey, you're great!
You're great!
We're gonna have a b-a-l-l here.
l guarantee you.
A lot of people term this project
an experiment, and l can't disagree.
What experiment
would be complete...
without the scientists,
hmm ?
I'd like to introduce
two of the finest...
psychological consultants
that money can buy.
And l wouldn't want you
to get the impression...
that we're buying
either of these gentlemen.
Actually, the one
on the end is rented,
and the gentleman sitting
next to him is leased.
No, I知 kidding.
The gentleman on the end--
What can J say ?
He's from one of the most
prestigious institutes...
we have in this country.
From Boulder, Colorado,
from the National lnstitute
of Human Behavior,
would you Welcome
Dr. Howard Hill.
[ Applauding ]
And the gentleman
sitting next to him--
What can l say ? You might have
seen him on some television shows.
A well-known author.
He's written books.
From the University
of Minnesota,
please give a nice Welcome
to Dr. Ted Cleary.
[ Applauding ]
A lot of you probably thought
Ted didn't stand up.
Actually, he is standing.
lsn't that great ?
- He eats very little.
- [ Laughter ]
You folks Jove to Laugh,
don't you ?
More than anything else, l'd love
to get into some humor with you,
but we really don't
have the time.
We're meeting the Yeagers at the
airport in less than half an hour.
So before yours truly
has to skidaddle out of here,
l'd like, if l could,
to share my sentiments l have...
about this beautiful city
with you, if l might.
Mort !
Ladies and gentleman, the man
at the piano, Mr. Mort Lindsay...
from ''The Merv Griffin Show. ''
And as much of his orchestra as
we could afford to bring down.
- Mort, if you will.
-?????? [ Piano ]
lt's something l jotted down
on the plane coming in yesterday,
specially from me to you.
? When an
irresistible town ?
? Such as you ?
? Meets a young, honest guy
like myself ?
? No one can doubt
it's gonna be great ?

? Something's Gotta give
Give me all you've Got ?
? Don't make me wait ?
How are you ?
Folks Like you ???

Thanks very much for the house.
You Got me my house.
-Who are you ?
-Donna Stanley, Stanley's Gift Shop.
Thanks for that little
plastic cactus. Yes.
- And who are you ?
- I知 Jack from Cincinnati.
You live down here ?
Just visiting ?
No, l came down
to watch you work.
lsn't that something ?
God bless you.
? l'd like to thank you all
but we don't have the time ?
? Or the cord, Lord ?
? Got to move, Got to get
this film on its way ?
? See you soon ?
? Hope you like
the expensive buffet ?
Two grand !
? I値l just say
a big thank you and ciao ???
Wow !

Thank you.
God bless you !
You're something else !
Thank you !

[ Birds Chirping ]
Hello.
So many of us go through life
doing one thing...
and dreaming of doing
something else.
I知 one of those people.
I知 in show business.
I知 fortunate to have that job,
but quite frankly,
if l'd studied harder
or been graded more fairly,
l would have been a scientist
or a doctor of some kind.
Well, the fulfillment of that
dream finally happened for me...
when l arrived here at the National
lnstitute of Human Behavior,
a few miles southwest
of Boulder, Colorado.
l knew from the inception
of this motion picture...
that without
scientific guidance...
from a nationally recognized
research organization,
very few people
would take this seriously.
However,
with that guidance...
we not only had a chance
at winning an Oscar,
but possibly
a Nobel Prize too.
Ooh !
lt gives me the chills.
Let's go inside.
Come on.
[ Brooks Narrating ]
Thousands of people responded...
to the advertisements scientifically
placed by the institute.
They filled out
preliminary questionnaires...
in the privacy
of their own homes.
Then, the 2 1 0 best families were
invited here for final testing.
These tests in Boulder were designed
to choose the one family unit...
that could best reflect day-to-day
Jiving in contemporary America,
and at the same time...
hold a motion picture audience
completely spellbound.
During the time
they stayed here,
the 2 1 0 families underwent
more than 1 45 separate tests,
totaling more than
2,500 test hours.
lf these tests could be
converted into eggs,
it would be enough to feed
a city the size of St. Louis...
for more than two years on
a two-egg-per-person per week basis.
Sound complicated ?
lt was, and very expensive.
However, even though we were paying
for this, for security reasons...
the institute allowed us
to film just a small portion...
of a few of the tests.
Honey, l completely
believe that.
[ Brooks Narrating ] Test 40, one
of three role reversal exercises.
The instructions were.?
Be someone else in your family.
This test was invaluable,
not just because of the insights
it gave into relationships,
but because it single-handedly
discouraged 23 families...
from further participation,
saving us more than $90,000
in wasted testing costs.
- l wanna go out and play.
- No ! You heard what mother said.
You have to stay in, do your
homework, and be quiet all day.
- But l wanna go out and play.
- NO !
- Well, l want to.
- l said no !
- l said yes.
- l don't care. I知 the boss.
Now you're gonna
get a beating.
l don't wanna do that.
Okay, okay. Harold, stop it !
-Don't call me Harold, call me Dad !
-Don't you hit me, you little--
- [ Shouts ]
- Damn you !
[ Brooks ]
ALL right. Thank you, Folks.
Thank you. Folks ?
[ Brooks Narrating ]
This was test 7 2, one of 1 5 tests...
utilizing state-of-the-art
computer technology.
This man...
was feeding all of
his facial features into this--
the Graphicon 8,000.
This amazing computer
would actually show...
what each family member's face
would photograph Like...
from every conceivable angle...
and then give us a digital readout
of their screen presence.
[ Buzzing ]
Okay, it should be simple.
[ Brooks Narrating ] Test 1 4 1,
known simply as the driving test.
Since much of anybody's Life
takes place in a car,
we wanted to make sure our
family wasn't going to kill us.
Dummies, acting as cameramen,
were placed...
in one of the 200 cars in the
institute's mobile test fleet.
When l tell you to start,
put the car in reverse,
- back it to that simulated garage.
- GO ?
ln reverse and back in there.
Okay, fine.
[ Horn Honks ]
You were supposed to put it back
in the simulated garage.
- What simulated garage ?
- Okay.
While the testing continued,
ground rules for the project
were slowly being developed.
Most important was
the unusual agreement...
that only the studio and a few
of the doctors at the institute...
would actually be allowed to see
the film as it was being shot.
The rest of us would have
to wait until the year was over.
This was done to reduce
possible confusion...
and to heighten
the reality.
But, to really heighten
the reality,
we needed a whole new generation
of motion picture equipment--
equipment that could stay
out of our family's way.
Two systems were chosen.
First, from Japan,
special heat-sensing
wall cameras like this.
These would be installed
wherever feasible.
These amazing devices
actually used body heat...
to focus in
on the nearest person.
Quiet, efficient,
expensive.
And then, to capture
what those couldn't,
a startling breakthrough
in technology.
The smallest, most versatile
motion picture camera ever made.
From Holland,
the Entanour 226-XL.
The Etanour is actually worn
over the head.
The camera is controlled
by using body movement,
and by operating this
human eye-like lens system.
[ Whirring ]
lsn't that something ?
And it can hear
like a human too...
with these special
omni-directional microphones...
located exactly where
we have our ears.
The Etanour needs
no special lighting.
And it uses no film.
Yes, all picture
and sound information...
is recorded digitally on
these integrated circuit chips,
some no larger than
a child's fingernail.
When these chips
are filled to capacity,
they will be removed from this,
then mailed back to the institute,
where they're decoded and then
transferred to film as we know it.
Only six of these cameras
were ever made.
Only five of them
ever worked.
We had four of those.
After six weeks of testing,
the families had been
narrowed down to two.?
the Andrew Feltons
from Green Bay, Wisconsin,
and the Warren Yeagers
from Phoenix, Arizona.
Using the sophisticated equipment
and the institute's direct mail,
the other hundreds of families
were notified...
that they were unsuitable.
Since these two finalists
had never met before,
each family served as a matching
set of strangers for the other.
They were given only  one instruction
for the hour-Long encounter.?
Be yourselves.
- You're with T.W.A. ?
- No, American.
Oh, uh-huh.
-You get to fly for free, don't you?
-We have to pay tax.
How much is the tax
to Europe ?
l don't know exactly.
Are there a maximum amount
of trips you can take ?
Oh, yes.
- Sounds great.
- Oh, yes.
To be perfectly frank,
we could find no difference.
Our research was so thorough,
the computers actually
coughed up two perfect families.
lf l were a liar, l could tell you
we chose one over the other...
for complicated
psychological reasons.
But I知 a Comedian,
not a liar.
l can afford the luxury
of honesty.
The Feltons lived
in Wisconsin.
The Yeagers lived
in Arizona.
You spend the winter
in Wisconsin.
[ All Laughing ]
[ Brooks Narrating ]
Phoenix!
Population.?
almost one million people.
The fastest growing metropolis
west of the Mississippi.
The Yeagers Jived here,
in one of the newer sections
of town, part of the fifth district.
Their house was located
at the end of a cul-de-sac...
called
View Crest Heights Drive.
Warren Yeager worked here at
the Arizona Veterinary CJinic,
one of the finest veterinary
hospitals in the new southwest.
The children attended school
at Benjamin Franklin Grammar School,
about two miles
from the family's home.
J was fortunate
to purchase the house...
directly across the street
from the Yeagers.
Jt was the first house J had
ever owned, and J must say,
J was proud.
That's it.
This man, However,
would not stop shaking my hand.
The Yeagers were sent on a two-week,
all-expense-paid trip to Hawaii...
so J could get settled in
without disturbing them.
J knew the house had
to be furnished with great care.
[ Horn Honking ]
We're here !
[ Brooks Narrating ] The Jiving room
was done in neo-Mediterranean style.
The playroom was done
contemporary, with a fun touch.
Let's put it outside.
And the sleeping area--
Well, with this round bed
and Large screen TV,
Let痴 just say if there were single
girls in Phoenix, I壇 find them.
The rest of the crew stayed here
at the Travel Lodge,
a nice place.
But enough about the crew,
for at this very moment...
a 707 was Landing
nonstop from Hawaii...
with our stars aboard.
lt's not degrading. What's degrading
about being introduced ?
- Howard, were you degraded ?
- There's professional dignity.
Why were you singing ? You were
just to inform them of the project.
l did. What's so bad
about making them happy ?
- They loved the song.
- l don't know about you, Howard.
l didn't go to graduate school to
be introduced as a part of an act.
An act. Howard, you've seen me work.
That's not my act, Ted.
An act's a very detailed thing with
a set opening, a three-minute hunk.
-Follow that with a ten-minute hunk.
-[ Warren ] Mr. Brooks. Albert.
Someone knows me in Phoenix.
Hi. How are you ? lt's Warren.
- We're in baggage!
- We missed the plane.
Great, good.
We're coming !
l Got mixed up myself. l thought--
Hey ! Hello !
- We missed you !
- He barely knows me.
Welcome home ! Aloha !
Look at this.
Look at this.
Real orchids.
Hello, Mrs. Yeager. And you.
Look at this. Come here.
Look at that. Okay !
Do we know everybody ?
These are the Etanours. l think
you read the literature on them.
These are my two
psychological consultants.
They'll be with us the entire year,
making sure everything is perfect.
- Did you meet Howard ?
- l don't think so.
Dr. Howard Hill.
He's from the institute.
-This gentleman's gonna be with us ?
-Yes, he is.
l won't be degrading.
I値l do it right this time.
I知 Dr. Ted Cleary. I知 not a
consultant, I知 more of an observer.
I知 writing a series
of articles on this project...
for the Journal of
American Psychology.
[ Brooks ] He's a Well-known author.
Written Jots of books.
You know who's going to publish
the articles he's writing ?
-l did tell him.
-The Journal of American Psychology.
Maybe the most prestigious
scientific journal in the world.
You know who reads these things ?
Jonas Salk, Buckminster Fuller,
William Buckley,
every scientist living.
They go to the mailbox,
they get it like magazines.
We're all gonna be on
Jonas Salk's coffee table.
- All right !
- Can you believe it ? He loves it.
One last thing, then I知
staying out of your lives.
Limo back to the house.
Just a special treat.
- Come on, let's go to the limo !
- l wanna tell you something.
We went to Maui. Jeanette didn't
want to go, but l told her--
What am l supposed to do ?
Get this luggage myself?
Excuse me One moment.
I知 sorry. I知 sorry, really.
- I知 sorry. I知 a little excited.
- You're completely out of it.
- Come On ! Come On !
- Okay !
- We Got the whole crew waitin'!
- Okay. Come on, Honey.
[ Applauding ]
Mr. Theodore Cleary !
All right, there he is !
The Yeagers !
You won't believe it.
Look, it's your parents.
We flew 'em in
from Tucson.
How are you ?
Oh, it's nice to see you.
lsn't this perfect ?
Okay, very quickly.
Oh, that's-- Love reunions.
Very quickly, folks. We want to meet
your crew. We lined 'em all up.
We'll do it just like
they meet royalty.
Dr. and Mrs. Yeager, Eric, Lisa.
We'll go down the line.
This is wardrobe.
Trucker. Cameraman.
- First A.D. Second A.D.
- What's an A.D. ?
Assistant director. We'll get to it
in a second. Another trucker.
- What are these people's names ?
- Not important. Let me finish.
- Wardrobe. Script.
- Script ? ls there a script ?
No, they're all part
of the package.
-Cameraman, another cameraman, grip.
-How do you do ? Hello.
This is a trucker.
This is a gopher.
- This is a gopher.
- Where ? Where ?
No, Eric, these people here.
lt's a term, okay ?
Publicity. This is a trucker,
driver, and a trucker. Okay ?
There's a few other people.
They're not here right Now.
Of course, thanks
to modern technology,
these people really aren't needed,
but the union makes us take 'em.
So, folks, we'll see you
at the premiere, huh ?
Have a nice time in Phoenix !
Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks for coming.
- Get good tans. Nice to see ya.
See ya again.
Nice to see ya.
Have a good stay.
See you next year.
Nice to see ya.
Okay ?
So, what can l tell you ?
Welcome home.
You wanna film something of us
coming out of the car ?
You kind of look tired.
Why don't you go in your house ?
Make yourself at home,
all right ?
l want to go over the rules, but we
can do that and the schedule later.
- You sure ?
- He just said so, didn't he ?
Okay ? So break a leg !
Be yourselves !
- Thank you for everything.
- Don't worry about it.
- Leis keep. Put 'em in the freezer.
- Okay. Thank you.
Have a good time Now.
Be yourselves! They Look great.
They're great.
They're great.
[ Brooks Narrating ]
They were great. What a family.
The Long trip from Hawaii did
Leave them a bit fatigued, However.
Especially Mrs. Yeager,
who thought she had a slight fever.
Although Dr. Yeager said it would
be all right to film them unpacking,
J thought it was appropriate to
give them an hour by themselves...
to relax and
get ready for dinner.
J took the opportunity to
finish antiquing my end table.
''Continuous motion
for oldest effect.''
The hour passed very quickly.
And before J knew it,
we were ready to join them...
for their first supper.
Eat your pizza, Honey.
Good pizza.
Honey, do you think
it's safe...
for you to be eating with
your heating pad in your lap ?
l have terrible cramps,
l am bleeding profusely...
and l want to vomit
on the table.
- [ Laughs ]
- [Jeanette ] What are you doing ?
l just wanna let them know
this is not the way...
we usually talk,
especially at the dinner table.
Okay. Why don't we--
Why don't we just, uh,
pretend that we just sat down,
and we can start over, okay ?
Great pizza, huh, kids ?
Kids ?
- l hate it.
- You hate it. [ Laughs ]
- Oh ! Eric.
- Goddamn it, Eric !
Watch your mouth. This is not the
language we use at the dinner table.
Since when have we had all these
rules at the dinner table ?
Lisa, don't use my good linen napkin
to wipe that up !
What am l supposed to use? There
are no other napkins in the house.
-There are too napkins in the house.
-Your mother's very uncomfortable.
lf you get smart with her again,
I知 gonna punish you. Understand?
- l hate it in here !
- You don't have to eat here.
lf you didn't, there'd be plenty
more food for the rest of us.
Don't start making her
feel guilty about the food.
God, you make me sick.
Because l stick up
for you ?
Eric, why don't you
just leave the towel ?
Wanna take your pizza
into your room ?
Take your pizza into your room
and watch some TV.
- Okay ?
- Okay.
Why does he have to finish
his dinner in the other room ?
J thought he could have
more fun eating there.
Oh, he can't have fun here ?
lt's hard to have fun when you
have to listen to your mother...
whining about her terrible
menstrual cramps every day.
- l mean, every day.
- J agree.
And it is also not much fun to
have an l.U.D. stuck in you...
to prevent, as you put it,
more mouths to feed.
[ Chuckles ]
l-- Look, l never said that.
l don't care what you said. l am
having this coil taken out Monday.
From Now on, if you want safe sex,
have it with one of your animals !
l know you didn't mean
anything by that,
so I知 not gonna say anything,
I知 just, uh--
You're just upset,
the way everybody gets.
[ Door Slams Shut ]
What a great day, huh ?
Sounds real exciting
over there, doesn't it ?
- Been spying on the neighborhood ?
- I知 not spying on anybody.
l live here. I知 allowed
to walk up and down the street.
What'd you think, Howard ?
Real good action for day one.
- Real good.
- Well, tension, not action.
Tension is action.
Don't you ever go to plays ?
What'd you think, Ted ?
Some good insights for you ?
lf l were running this project,
those people would have Gotten...
some rest tonight,
and day one would've been tomorrow.
We all agreed at the meeting
that when they Got off the plane,
- that was the beginning.
- Absolutely !
We all pretty much agreed,
but l disagreed.
Look, it's done.
lt's on film.
l think we Gotta keep remembering,
whatever we do is fine,
it's perfect,
it's the movie.
Oh, great.
lt may be fine and perfect,
but the added tension is making your
leading man Come off unsympathetic.
- What ?
- That's only my observation.
No, he's very sympathetic.
lf you don't look at it from the
dramatic point, you'll never see it.
Here's a guy.
He's Got a wife, two kids.
- He's threatened by society.
- Oh, Come on Now !
On one hand, he doesn't want to make
the same mistakes his parents made.
On the other hand, he's not so sure
his parents made mistakes.
Maybe he likes himself,
maybe he doesn't.
Jesus, l think it's a hell
of a complex character.
Don't you think so, Howard ?
He's complex.
- He's fine. Just relax.
- l am relaxed !
l don't like my leading man
being called unsympathetic...
on the basis
of four minutes of film.
- [ Chuckles ]
- He's good, huh ? He's good.
He was good at the airport.
He was good !
On one hand he likes himself,
on the other hand he doesn't.
Honey ?
Honey,
what's the problem ?
There's no problem. l just don't
like you very much right Now.
Cramps is a bad beginning
for your movie,
so I知 gonna spend
the weekend at Bonnie's.
lt's our movie. lt was our decision.
You don't have to leave.
- What about the children ?
- The children know.
I知 sure they could film
your better moments.
Don't make me get
in an argument.
There's no argument. After all,
they're paying for the whole family.
I値l call you tomorrow.
Honey, you wanted this
as much as l did.
You値l benefit from it too.
Warren, will you please--
[ Car Door Closes,
Motor Revving ]
Latch onto Jeanette !
Hello, Mrs. Yeager !
Where you going ?
Listen, l would just like to go
be alone for a little while.
- l think l need to be alone Now.
- Can we Come with you ?
No, l really want
to be alone.
- Well--
-Just by myself.
We're gonna deal with this later
because this wasn't in the rules.
lt's all right. Go ahead.
Would you take the little car ?
We're driving to work with Warren.
We'd like to use the station wagon.
lt's just hard to fit both...
cameras in there.
- Could one person Come with you ?
- NO.
- One ? That's all right. Go ahead.
- Please ?
- l need to be by myself.
- Okay. l understand.
There's a lot of room
in here if we just-- One--
[ Engine Revving ]
[ Tires Screeching ]
lf you'd like to go beyond
the original year...
to make up these days,
it's okay.
No, l don't think
you understand.
There's no making up days.
This is the reality.
This is it.
She left.
That's real.
Everything that happens--
even us Now--
it's all--
it's all the reality.
Very good.
She came out angry like that.
Got right in the car.
You followed her. All good stuff.
Very, very good.
Really.
- l should go on living as usual ?
- Mm-hmm. That's it.
Don't worry about anything.
You're very good.
Thanks.
[ Brooks ] Warren Yeager tried to
carry on as if nothing had happened,
but he was uncomfortable
because of his wife's absence.
[ Radio.? Rock ]
Honey ?
- The music goes into my bedroom.
- [ Radio Clicks Off ]
- What are you doing ?
- What are you doing ?
- I知 fantasizing.
- Don't fantasize.
I知 a big motion picture star.
These are my cameras.
That's my director.
- And you are my lover.
- Okay.
Kiss me,
my beautiful lover.
Take me in your arms
and kiss me.
Take off the dress.
lt's your confirmation dress.
- How long we've been apart.
- Listen to what you're saying.
Take and kiss me like
you've never kissed me before.
Honey, Come On. You're gonna
get hit. Now get out of this dress.
l can stay in this dress.
Mother said l could.
- I値l bet she did.
- She did !
- Ask her, if she ever Comes back.
- Okay, Come on. That's it.
- Where's Eric ?
- He's playing with the crew.
He's not supposed to.
Didn't you tell him that ?
No. I知 not his mother,
remember ?
Okay, don't get smart with me !
[ Sighs ]
Cereal on the floor.
I値l just make breakfast Now.
I値l make some eggs.
Put this back.
I値l make eggs.
[ Brooks Narrating ]
On Sunday, Mrs. Yeager called me...
and said she would be
coming home that evening,
but asked if she could
see me first privately...
at the Desert Plaza
Shopping Center.
So he says, ''You think that's bad,
her sister's twice as fat.''
[ Laughing ]
Ah. Over here.
The institute and J agreed that
meetings with any family members...
should be discouraged,
but this did sound important.
l was hoping
we could be alone.
This is alone.
This is alone as l ever get.
- How was your weekend ?
- Oh, it was okay.
Thank you for giving me
that time.
l know How important
the movie is to you.
I知 sorry. l know
you didn't have to do it.
Don't worry about it. l mean, it's
important. l didn't have to do it.
-But it's a decision, and l made it.
-lt was a loving decision.
Oh, God, no.
No love.
lt's just a decision.
I知 making 'em all the time.
What's up ?
Why'd you want to meet me ?
l wanted to tell you
that l like you,
and that this movie means as much
to me as it does to everybody else.
- l hope l didn't hurt anything.
- Oh, no, no. Nothing can hurt it.
That's the beauty part of this film.
lt is what it is.
lt's like a movie in a movie,
in a movie, in a movie. You know?
Well, you were very sweet,
and l wanted to do something
for you in return.
- Oh, don't.
- No, really, l want to.
l made an appointment
with my gynecologist...
for a quarter to 1 0:00
tomorrow morning.
And if you want to, you and
the crew can feel free to join me.
Film the gynecologist ?
Mrs. Yeager !
l can't be-- Oh, boy !
- Oh, yes ! Great !
- There's one small problem.
I知 not gonna shoot anything
that'll embarrass you. l swear.
l couldn't use it anyway.
I知 locked into a P.G.
l didn't mean anything like that.
No, it's Warren. l--
l haven't told Warren
that you're going with me,
and l don't think
that anyone should tell him.
See, this thing
is so new to him,
and he's very nervous
and edgy.
I知 sure that in a month or two
it would be fine, you know.
But right Now
he's a little upset and--
Since it wasn't planned--
l just-- l think
he would say no...
and we would just get
into another argument.
[ Crying ] And I知 real tired
of arguing with him.
Ooh, look--
- Go home.
- l don't know what's happening.
He just doesn't seem to understand
anything at all anymore.
[ Crying ]
Mrs. Yeager,
let me ask you a question.
Do you think he Comes off
unsympathetic ?
- Mm-hmm.
- No. No, really.
See if you can detach yourself
for a minute.
Look at it from
the dramatic point.
Here's a guy.
He's Got a wife, two kids.
He's threatened, you know ?
Threatened by society.
On one hand he's Got
the parental thing,
on the other hand he's Got
the pressures of his work.
An audience has Got to have
sympathy for a guy like this.
He's a very complex guy. People have
sympathy for a guy who's complex.
Don't you think so ? Think about it.
He is complex, isn't he ?
- You're such a sensitive man.
- Oh, no, no.
lt's just a theory.
I知 not, no.
Well, l want you to meet me
outside my doctor's building...
- at a quarter to 1 0:00 tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Okay ?
- Okay.
- I知 gonna go home Now.
- Okay.
You gave me
the strength.
Thanks.
Oh. [ Spits ]
l--
l didn't give you--
l gave you nothing, Mrs. Yeager.
l gave you nothing. Don't think I知
anything better than what you have.
l gave you nothing. Don't think I知
anything better than what you have.
You think I致e Got this charisma,
but J don't!
l really don't, Mrs. Yeager.
lt's just--
l have a bit of it, but it just sits
on the surface. lt doesn't run deep.
- No kissing.
- Deeper than you think.
- I鱈L call you tomorrow.
- Mrs. Yeager, it's been measured.
lt doesn't run deep.
No kissing here.
I知 a shallow fellow.
Look. Shallow, shallow.
Really! Shallow!
She didn't know.
What am l gonna do ?
l didn't call this.
l didn't do it.
Let me just...
go out of frame this way.
All right.
During the examination,
basically get her expressions.
Just very nice. No--
We're not gonna shoot anything--
- Perfect. Just like this, huh ?
- l trust you.
No, don't. No trust.
No, honestly. Shallow.
- No. These are just decisions.
- [ Nurse ] Mrs. Yeager?
- The doctor will see you Now.
- All right, here we go.
Tasteful. Taste.
Just remember.
Uh, excuse me. l don't think
the doctor would like...
anyone other than the patient
in the examining room.
Oh, there's been a mistake.
See ?
We're filming her life,
and we have her permission.
Someone from my crew was here
this morning and Got a release.
No, not today.
You must be mistaken.
l don't think I知 mistaken.
I値l check.
Margaret, be with you
in a few minutes.
- Mrs. Yeager, How you feeling ?
- Much better, thank you.
- What are these ?
- These are cameras.
Oh, no.
Oh, goddamn it !
What's going on ? l was cleared !
Come on, get out of here !
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a big motion picture.
-I知 Albert Brooks.
-l don't care who the hell you are !
Talk to my lawyers.
l was cleared. Get out. Out !
Dr. Rennert, these people are
with me. They're filming my life.
I知 sorry, but l had bad experiences
with the 60 Minutes people.
We're not news. We're not digging.
l don't even ask questions.
I知 just filming her,
and right Now you're in their life.
They're in my life !
Mrs. Yeager, I知 getting angry.
My blood pressure's starting
to soar. What do you want me to do ?
You want them in here ? Fine.
They can take out your l.U.D.
- Two Thorazine.
- You don't understand.
l know what he wants.
This isn't a student film.
What are we talking about ?
Look. Huh ?
There's four of us here, okay ?
He wants an abortion.
All right ?
Two. Make it two.
I値l take a hysterectomy.
She'll have the same.
How about this for parking ?
You think $500 might do it ?
l just wanna film her life.
Please, don't make trouble.
You're gonna give me $500
to film an examination ?
Oh, my God !
Maxwell Rennert.
- The baby broker !
- Oh, goddamn it !
- Get out ! l don't need this !
- l can't believe it !
Didn't you see that incredible thing
Mike Wallace did on this man ?
Sold children.
They were like baby slave auctions.
One of the best things
on 60 Minutes I致e ever seen !
- Mike sent me a letter of apology.
- I値l bet. Let's see it.
lt's out being perma-plaqued.
You get out of here, goddamn it.
- GO On, get Out. You, get Out.
-Just a minute.
[ Brooks ]
This guy's nuts! J want this!
[ Rennert ] Look at me. My hands
are shakin'like a 90-year-old.
[ Snoring ]
[ Ringing ]
[ Coughing ]
- [ Ringing ]
- [ Mumbles ]
[ Brooks Coughing ]
Hello ?
Hi. Did l wake you ?
Oh.
l fell asleep for a minute.
I知 up though.
- How are you ? How you feeling ?
- Not too well.
Listen, Mrs. Yeager.
I知 very sorry about yesterday.
Maybe somebody in the crew
can help you find another doctor.
- What do you think ?
- No, that's okay. I知 not--
- That's okay.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, it's a nice
sunny day out, huh ?
ls there anyplace to go
horseback riding around here ?
My grandmother
had a stroke this morning.
Oh, my God !
That's terrible.
- How old is she ?
- Eighty-one.
Well, that's very old.
l mean--
That's almost 90.
Did you tell Warren ?
NO, not yet.
Oh, Mrs. Yeager,
you didn't call me first !
Yeah.
Don't do that.
Share this with him.
[ Jeanette ]
l hope she'll be okay. l just--
Aw, she'll be all right.
[ Jeanette ] l hadn't called
in about three months.
Oh ! Honey !
l just--
[ Sobbing ]
Hi.
- [ Sobbing Continues ]
- Gotta go !
You cry it through, Mrs. Yeager.
Be alone. Share it with her husband.
She called me.
What are you writing ?
-Just some notes.
- Ted, she called me. What notes ?
What happened to the effort we were
making to stay out of their lives ?
Ted, she called me.
Ted doesn't understand.
Ted ! Ted !
[ Chuckles ]
Ted!
Ted, look,
l didn't do anything here.
lt's only the first week,
and she seems to be
relying on you quite a bit.
- What do you mean ?
- Why didn't she call her husband ?
Ask her that.
I知 not the Indian rubber man.
My arm didn't slither across
the street, dial her phone...
and then snap back in.
ls the Journal gonna print I知
interfering because l took a call ?
l don't know what
the Journal's gonna print.
Ted, we've Got
to lighten up here.
- Her grandmother had a stroke.
- Mm-hmm.
I知 wondering if maybe you're
a little uncomfortable because--
Well, you know,
it's Phoenix and you're...
the only--
Well, you know.
There's not a, a lot of--
lt's Phoenix.
There's--
You know what I知 trying to say ?
Y-You're, you're--
You're the only--
Albert, you have more trouble
dealing with a black person...
than any white man
l have ever met.
[ Sighs ]
l beg your pardon ?
-Hey, black meets white.
-Ted, I知 not trying to do anything.
I知 just trying to tune in
on your particular level of anxiety.
- That's all.
- Boogie ! Boogie ! Boo !
Ted, stop distorting-- No,
I知 not black, nor do l claim to be.
There's fears, misunderstandings,
and all that other mumbo-jumbo,
but they should have nothing
to do with this project.
l know that you people are gonna
take over the earth, okay ?
You're stronger, faster.
You use heat better.
You've Got the whole
next century wrapped up.
l know about Africa. lt's seething.
Boom ! There it goes.
But it shouldn't stand
in the way of this film.
We're working as a team.
We should put all that
other stuff on the back burner.
Oh, yeah ! We can put all ''dat''
on the back burner !
Let me go in the kitchen
and check on the burner Now.
- See--
- [ Laughing ]
l find that insulting, Ted.
l find that insulting.
l never said you talked like that.
That's why people like Jonas Salk...
think Comedians are jerks.
Fine, he's writing that down.
I値l write it too.
''l never said that.''
Get that down on paper.
Get a permanent record of that.
Date this.
Now it's all permanent.
That's not what you said !
You said this would be my scene.
- We don't have time. I知 sorry.
- Albert !
l've Gotta go.
Larry, in here. Let's go.
- She's only getting confirmed once.
- Honey, it's an emergency.
[ Brooks ]
Good luck ! Wait for the guy.
Okay. All right, he's in.
Let's go.
- Bye, bye.
- lt's not nice to break a promise.
Wait a second. Honestly, this
is Sunday. l don't have two crews.
- But my dress !
- I知 filming your dress.
- Get a good shot of her dress.
- This isn't fair.
lf you have time, when you're
finished, Come by the church.
- [ Warren ] We will!
- Bye, bye.
- You liar !
- Bye.
[ Warren ]
Bye, bye.
l feel bad about
letting her down.
Don't worry. She's fine.
You made the right decision.
lf you pull over for a second--
l can get another crew.
You did the best
you could, really.
You haven't had an emergency
since we've been here.
- l haven't had one in six months.
- Really ?
- This is exciting.
- Yes, it is.
Don't worry about anything.
Everything is under control.
[ Brooks ] Apparently, a beautiful
old show horse had a heart attack...
in the middle of a parade
in downtown Phoenix.
Without an immediate
and delicate bypass operation,
the horse wouldn't make it.
Although Yeager had performed this
kind of surgery only  once before,
he expressed confidence,
and put the horse's owner at ease.
[ Motor Whirring ]
At 1 1.?30,
preparation for surgery began.
Take it up.
[ Whirring Continues ]
Okay.
[ Murmuring ]
[ Whirring Continues ]
[ Whirring Stops ]
[ Brooks Narrating ]
Things proceeded smoothly.
At 1 1.?38 the horse was hooked up
to the artificial respirator.
[ Breathing Sound ]
[ Ticking ]
The time was drawing near.
At 1 1.?4 1...
Yeager and his assistants
had finished their preparation.
We were ready.
You could feel the excitement
in the air as Yeager ordered...
the final dosage
of anesthetic.
Okay, let's give him
two and a half percent halothane...
and then give me
capillary refill time please.
[ Breathing Sound Continues ]
[ Hissing ]
[ Nurse ]
Two and a half percent.
Uh, refill time:
one second.
Good. That's good.
Okay.
Let's go over our final checklist,
and we're ready.
Respiration ?
- Six.
- Good.
Let me see. Blood pressure?
What was the blood pressure earlier?
One-ten Over 60.
What do we have Now ?
One hundred over 52.
That's perfect.
Okay, let me see. Uh--
Check pupil dilation.
Good. Okay.
Color's good.
Let's check his pulse.
Okay. This is
dressed properly.
- Pulse is 44.
- Good. E.K.G. ?
- Normal.
- Okay.
Uh, let's give him the anesthetic,
and we're on our way.
Two and a half percent
halothane.
You want another two and a half
percent ? Dr. Yeager ?
- What ?
- Two and a half percent ?
Yes.
[ Hissing ]
- That's five percent halothane.
- Five ?
NO, no, no.
l said two and a half percent.
l heard you order it twice.
Oh, no. l couldn't have said that.
Two and a half percent.
- You said it twice.
- No, that's too much.
- That's too much.
- [ Male Assistant ] You ordered it.
- l did ? Are you sure ?
- Yes. We Got it on the film.
Oh, my God !
- [ Distorted Ticking ]
- Wait! Don't panic.
Don't panic.
Do something.
[ Quickened Respiration,
Deflation ]
[ Respiration,
Deflation Stop ]
We have no pulse.
Two and a half and
two and a half makes five.
[ Brooks Narrating ]
The operation was over at 1 1.?45,
Well ahead of schedule.
Oh, no.
Dr. Yeager took a short break,
and then asked if he could
see me alone in his office.
Of course I obliged.
- Quite an ordeal, huh ?
- Yes, it was.
Albert, l know
we have an agreement,
and probably shouldn't
be asking you this.
But l'd be rather embarrassed
if what just went on in there...
were included in this movie.
lt's not gonna do me
any good at all personally.
People in Phoenix
are gonna see this movie.
l think you're
overreacting.
l know what you're saying, but l
think it showed you in a good light.
- lt was very interesting.
- l appreciate that.
But I知 gonna have to continue to
work here after this film Comes out.
l don't know if l owned an animal
and l saw me losing that horse,
whether l would trust me,
you know ?
Yeah, but l wouldn't
worry about it.
You see, people go to doctors
for personal reasons,
and you gave off
something very good in there.
lt seems like you did
everything you could.
You just didn't know. You made
a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes.
l don't know if people are
understanding when it Comes to pets.
- l think they are.
- l've had people Come to me...
because somebody else botched up
a broken leg on a dog, for example--
No, l think people
are very understanding.
They've been very bitter about
whomever they've been to before.
This is the worst advertising
a person like me could have.
- You understand that ?
- Well, I値l tell you what.
- Don't worry about it Now.
- lt's on my mind Now.
Forget it Now. As far as
you're concerned Now, it's out.
You couldn't just sign something
to that effect, could you ?
Mmm, no. l mean, l could,
but then it's gonna be on my mind.
- [ Knocks ]
- Hello ?
- No one's in here.
- [ Dog Barking ]
- Dr. Yeager ?
- [ Barking ]
- What the hell's goin' on here ?
- [ Barking ]
Hello ?
Anybody home ?
Could you at least give me
some kind of assurance...
that this won't be the only time
in the movie you'll see me working ?
Can you show me saving
all those cats and dogs ?
Come on, will ya ?
Remember the old saying.?
''To err is human;
to film divine.''
No, it was very good.
[ Knocking ]
- What happened ?
- We lost her.
- You lost her ?
- I知 sorry.
- How could you lose her ?
- I知 really sorry.
Don't you have people here
who stay with the animals ?
Let's get the damn hell
out of here and find her.
[ Brooks ] That was the beginning
of what was to be a bad time...
in the Yeagers'lives.
On Wednesday Mrs. Yeager
was informed...
that her grandmother
passed away from the stroke.
The funeral took place
two days Later,
and we were graciously
allowed to film it.
Through Jesus Christ,
our Lord. Amen.
''Jesus said, 'l am
the resurrection and the life.
'He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead--'''
l hate to keep harping on this,
but l can't concentrate on my work.
l've never killed
an animal that size.
This isn't the place.
We'll talk about it later.
Honey, this is the place.
I知 upset, you're upset.
- What if he uses that scene ?
- [ Clears Throat ]
Could you stop talking about
the movie for just one minute ?
- What's the matter ?
- What's the matter ?
Look up there.
That's my grandmother.
l realize that, but what's gonna
happen when the kids go to school...
and their friends say, ''Hey, did
your dad really kill that horse'' ?
What are the kids gonna say ? What
are they gonna tell their friends ?
lf l could have
your undivided attention.
I知 sure you'll feel better
after this is over.
Let us pray.
Almighty God--
[ Brooks ] Things Got worse.
The following week was...
one of the most depressing periods
J had experienced since childhood.
The entire family
was Now grief stricken.
She with her grandmother,
he with the grandmother
and the animal.
Day after day
was the same.
Lifeless.
Dr. Yeager would sleep sometimes
for 1 8 hours straight.
As a filmmaker J was frustrated.
J wanted to help.
- [ Radio News, lndistinct ]
- Dr. Yeager ?
[ Radio Newsman ] An exhibition
of paintings by Navajo children...
will be on display
throughout the month.
Dr. Yeager ?
[ Phone Ringing ]
Hello ?
Jeanette ?
lt's Albert.
- Hi.
- Well, l know that you two...
have been very depressed,
and, uh--
Well, l've been
avoiding you.
l don't know if you're aware of it,
but l have for a couple of weeks...
'cause l didn't think
we should be getting involved.
And Now I知 beginning
to think...
that if l can help you,
maybe you can help everybody else.
So, uh-- What am l trying to say ?
You wanna have dinner with me ?
A snack ?
You wanna--
- Dinner ?
- Well, l mean, look.
l thought about that scene
we had at the shopping center.
lt was a good scene.
lt was nice action. And we talked.
That's more than anyone else
is doing right Now, so--
l mean, maybe--
l don't know. Come on over.
Albert, l feel badly
about that day.
I知 still a little embarrassed
about that.
- l think what you said was right.
- What did l say ?
You said about you not being
any better than what l already have.
- l said that ?
- l think you were right.
Come on, get serious.
l have to make this work, or I知 not
gonna have any respect for myself.
- You know what l mean ?
- l see. Okay.
Aw, Albert, this has
nothing to do with you.
lt's between
Warren and me.
You hate me then, Now,
right ?
No, no. [ Chuckles ]
l think you're very nice.
Nice. Okay.
You do what you have to do.
Just talk, though.
Work it out with language. lt helps.
I知 not D.W. Griffith. I知 gonna get
in trouble if there's no dialogue.
- We will.
- Okay. Promise ?
- lt's going to get better.
- Great.
[ Brooks Narrating ]
It didn't.
The following Saturday, Jeanette
invited some friends over...
for a barbecue.
She set the table,
he set the mood.
J couldn't take it anymore.
J had decided
that was it!
These people
had been depressed...
- Long enough.
- [ Doorbell Ringing]
[ Brooks ] HeJJo ?
[ Knocking ]
? Ooh, it's a lovely day
today ?
? lt's a cheery kind of day ?
Where are the kids ?
- What're you doin' ?
- ? Oh, let's play all the day ?
- Where are the kids ?
- School. Lisa had a test.
? Oh, Lisa had a test ?
Where's Eric ?
- Went with Lisa.
- Ooh.
Well, this was just a very serious
attempt to cheer everybody up.
But l needed the kids.
lt was really for them.
- I値l Come back when they're home.
- Albert, please Come in.
-We're just talking. Please Come in.
-But l did this--
- I値l Come back.
- l understand. Please Come in.
No, Come on. l Gotta shower.
Let me shower.
- Albert, please.
- Okay, we'll Come in. Okay. Hi.
- Hi.
- No, l Gotta go home. Come on.
Please. l'd really
appreciate it. Please.
-Just sit down for a moment.
- All right, okay. Okay.
How are you ?
- You want a cup of coffee ?
- NO, no.
Hi.
Well, I知 sure
you know that...
we're upset.
What, are you
kidding me ?
That's why l rented this whole
outfit. ''You didn't rent me.''
- Bunny, we're talking seriously.
- Albert, wait.
[ Warren ]
Now, J don't know too much about it,
but l feel like I知 having
a nervous breakdown.
Oh, no !
Don't act like that.
Come On.
The best thing you can do
is just to relax.
See, when you feel this way,
you clam up.
That's no good.
[ Crunching Sound ]
l understand there's been
a couple of deaths.
So what ?
Look. l haven't Gotten used
to this whole process myself.
[ Crunching Sound ]
l cried the other night.
- About what ?
- l don't remember.
See ? I知 mixed up too.
l just don't clam up.
[ Crunching Sound ]
Look.
There's a big meeting
coming up at the end of this month.
You know, with the institute
and the people from the studio.
The one we're not
invited to ?
''l can't go either.''
That's right, he can't.
Why don't l see if
l can call it earlier ?
Maybe tomorrow or Wednesday
if they can get down here.
l don't know exactly what to
tell you, but these people do.
They're scientists.
That's their business.
lf you'd listen to me, though,
l think you'd feel better.
Just get it out.
Don't internalize.
Talk to anybody, a neighbor.
Talk to an animal.
Really,
Warren.
Trust me.
[ indistinct ]
[ Brooks Narrating ]
We called the meeting for Wednesday.
These monthly feedback
and input sessions...
were crucial
to the success of this project.
For the institute, this was the time
to provide analysis and guidance,
based on the footage
they were viewing.
For the studio, this was the time
to discuss financial matters,
personnel problems,
and other cinematic details.
This is Dr.leremy Noland, project
coordinator for the institute,
an ambitious man.
Dr. Ann Kramer, a good psychologist,
generally a nice person.
J think she Liked me.
Dr. Hill was there,
Dr. Cleary,
and Martin Brand, the studio
executive in charge of this picture.
Brand took this project over
from a younger man who was fired.
Martin was used to
the old Hollywood...
with its big stars
and lavish sets.
He didn't know
what we were doing here.
J guess that's why he felt it was
unnecessary to Come to Phoenix.
We've taken voiceprints from day 1 2
to day 1 8, compared them against...
the prints of these same people
from the first week of the project,
and no matter which way we computed
them, they came out the same.
Now, these people are definitely
operating differently Now...
than when filming started.
There are changes in all
four voiceprint patterns.
The extent of these changes
is confirmed...
by changes in body temperature,
as revealed by the infrared
analysis of the film.
Now, each of us may have a different
explanation for what's going on,
but it's undeniable that you've
altered the reality you're filming.
ln my opinion, you're getting
a false reality here,
and l don't know
what you're gonna do about it.
Me ? Wait a second.
l-l'd like to get back to something
Ann said a little earlier.
You said you think l look heavier
Now than when the filming started.
- Where ? ln the cheeks ?
- NO, no.
l said that in some of the later
footage, you look somewhat fatigued.
- Oh, l see. That's all right.
- Not fat, fatigued.
l've been up a lot. Fatigued is
okay, but heavy's another thing.
'Cause l eat raw vegetables.
There's no reason l should--
- Mr. Brooks ?
- Yes ?
- You look fine.
- Okay.
Now l'd like, if we could,
to go to day four.
l believe that's,
uh, scene 31 .
[ Sighs ]
Now here's some footage
l'd like to show you.
- Lights.
- What ?
- What did you say ?
- Lights.
Oh, no. See, this is my home.
lt's not a projection room.
lf you say, ''Would you like to turn
the lights off?'' l'd say, ''Sure.''
''Lights,'' he says.
Man lives in the kitchen ?
Uh--
Now, we've blown up
what l want to show you,
and I知 gonna keep repeating it,
because it's hard to catch.
ln fact, the computer didn't
catch it till the second run.
[ Noland ] When we started
filming Warren Yeager,
he was drinking coffee
with his right hand only ,
no assistance at all
from his left hand--
as distinctive a trait
as handwriting.
Now watch again.
Right hand only .
That's it.
Now, on day 1 3,
he starts drinking coffee
with both his hands.
Now watch the decision.
There! Now watch again.
[ Brooks ]
What ?
[ NoJand ]
Watch the decision. There!
See ? He's much Jess relying
on his entire right side.
[ Brooks ]
Oh, Come on !
[ Kramer ] Yes, it's conceivable
that within two months...
he will have shifted the cup
entirely to his left hand,
and his right will remain unused
throughout the entire gesture.
[ Noland ] Mm-hmm.
Total change in body language.
Lights.
Very interesting.
l hadn't noticed it at all.
Well, wait a minute.
l mean, this cup could've been hot.
Nope. The infrared
analysis of the film...
shows no difference in the
effective temperature of the dish.
[ Brand ] Albert, may l interrupt
for one minute, please ?
People aren't gonna walk out
saying, ''l don't like that guy,
the guy who holds the cup
with one hand, with two hands.''
Absolutely.
I鱈L tell you what they do have
a good chance of saying.
''Where the hell is Paul Newman ?
Where's Redford ? Nicholson ?''
-Jesus.
- They prefer Nicholson...
than the cup
with the other guy.
Albert, so you keep Yeager in,
but you Gotta get somebody
in the movie, for Christ's sake.
You oughta add a next-door neighbor,
or a boss, or a cleaning lady,
somebody with a name,
somebody who'd draw some people.
You've Got rock friends.
Would it be so bad to have
Neil Diamond sitting in a meeting ?
Schmuck! You値l make a hell of a
Jot more money with Neil Diamond...
than with the guy with the cup !
Could we get back on the track ?
l need someone to get that cup.
Stop with the cup !
Really, l can't hear this anymore.
l-l don't know what
you're talking about.
- Explain to me in English, please.
- All right.
Quite simply,
the filming has triggered...
a drastic emotional change
in these people's lives.
They don't know How to deal with it,
and you don't know How to.
And that's bad ?
l don't live in a world of good
and bad. l don't talk that language.
We're building a Jot of conclusions
on a little bit of evidence.
Maybe what these people
are going through is growth.
-Maybe it's inevitable, and healthy.
-Absolutely right. Howard's right.
Excuse me. l would like
to hear from Dr. Cleary.
- Do you want to know what l think ?
- Yes, please.
Okay.
We get out of these people's lives.
We must get out of this house.
- Oh, wait a minute.
- I知 not through.
We go away at night.
We film only when scheduled.
We give them privacy and stability
so when they wake up in the morning,
they don't think that
they're on a movie set !
A movie set. Martin, tell him How
different this is from a movie set.
On a movie set, you Got
actors that are well-known.
lf they give you trouble, call their
agents and put heat under their ass.
Thanks. Look, Ted, there's
no reason to get out of this house.
l spent a lot in purchasing it, and
a lot decorating. lt's unnecessary.
- lt is very necessary.
- It's not necessary.
You know How difficult it is
to get wallpaper ?
-How difficult is it ?
-Very difficult ! This is Phoenix !
We're talking about people's lives,
and you're talking about wallpaper !
You know you spend 80%% of your life
looking at walls ?
- Gentlemen, please.
- [ Arguing ]
l went to L.A.
for that wallpaper !
- The reason--
- Wait a minute. May l--
- May l please make a suggestion ?
- Who invited you into the bedroom ?
- Mr. Brooks, please ?
- What ?
The institute has a center
up in the foothills...
that's used for therapy sessions,
mainly for executives and clients.
l think we should consider taking
the Yeagers up there for a weekend.
l think they'll
open up again.
Oh, yes. You mean like Echelon ?
Like hot tubs ?
- Nature trails, massage.
- Absolutely !
See ? That's somethin'
l can use ! Great.
- Thank you.
- Are you crazy ?
You wanna fly all these people
to Colorado ?
- What ?
- Why don't you put 'em on drugs ?
Give them psychiatrists.
Enroll them all in private schools.
[ Brand ] Just a minute !
We Got a budget !
Remember the costs, Dr. Clearson.
Please remember the costs.
Oh, yeah.
Costs.
You spend a half a million
dollars on research.
l don't think you've spent a dime
finding a qualified person...
to head this project.
You've Got someone
at the controls of a 7 4 7...
who's never even flown
as a passenger.
That was
Airport '76.
Ted, l think l've
logged more miles...
than you and your entire
university put together.
- You're missing the point.
- I知 not missing the point.
I知 a million-miler. You know what
that means ? I値l show you my pin.
l can get into any V.l.P. lounge
in this country, Ted.
l knock, l tell 'em my name, give
the pin number, sit in the lounge.
J drink coffee, eat doughnuts, and
J don't have to be flying anywhere.
How many people do you know
who can do that, huh ?
How many people can go and say,
''Let me in, J just wanna sit'' ?
J can do that, Ted,
in O'Hare Airport.
I致e taken a date there
after a movie.
Just had coffee in the lounge,
and l wasn't even flying anywhere !
- Missing your point !
- Albert, Albert.
Ted, Come on. l-l feel
what we need Now is a break.
- I知 starving. Can we eat ?
- Great idea.
l know a great Mexican-like
restaurant. I値l treat, okay ?
We're just gettin'
all cooped up here.
- Albert, I知 gonna hang up Now.
- Okay, Martin.
- l wanna leave you with two words.
- Yeah ?
James Caan.
ls that real enough for you ?
That's great.
Bye-bye.
- Come on, Ted.
- Albert, Albert.
- Can l speak to you a second ?
- Come on, let's go eat.
Could you sit down
for a minute ?
Sure.
My association with
this project has ended.
I知 leaving Phoenix
as soon as J can.
Why ? 'Cause we just
had a little tiff?
Come on, Ted. Come out and eat.
You'll feel better.
No, You値l feel better.
Eating doesn't do that for me.
- We're not the same person.
- l have to disagree with you.
l think we're
very much alike.
See, that's why we can get
into these kind of debates.
l think you'd be surprised
at How much alike we really are.
l'd be more than surprised.
l'd be suicidal.
Good luck
to you.
Ted, may l ask
a personal question ?
Don't you like the accommodations ?
Do you want a suite ?
Really, sometimes two rooms
can make a big difference.
You read in one
and sleep in the other.
l know what a single can do.
lt can get depressing.
- You amaze me, truly.
- Well, thank you.
But what about the
Journal of American Psychology ?
lt's just possible
if you leave Now,
the Journal may not be thrilled
with a half-assed job.
The Journal of American Psychology ?
Are you kidding ?
Their field is science,
not buffoonery.
You take care,
you hear ?
What do you mean
their field is science, Ted ?
Wait a minute, Ted !
Come back !
lf their field is science,
what do you think this is ?
Look, Ted !
This is science !
What is the institute ?
Dry cereal, Ted ?
Come back !
Science ! Look !
lt's all science !
Ted, Come back !
Ted ?
l was upset...
by Dr. Cleary's
sudden departure.
All right !
[ Brooks ] But it turned out
to be a blessing in disguise.
We're gonna need some help.
Larry, don't worry about filming.
J think the pressure of the Journal
was just too much for everyone.
Yeah, put it
in your living room.
Given a little time and help
from his wife and family,
Dr. Yeager started
to Come out of his shell.
J was grateful,
and J wanted him to know it.
Wait. Larry, we're gonna need help,
okay ? We'll get help in a second.
- l feel guilty about taking it.
- No, don't feel guilty.
Someone gave it to me.
What am l gonna do, throw it away ?
- Why can't you use it ?
- lt's very expensive.
- l know. Why don't you use it ?
- Well, it's just--
I知 in the business, you know ?
And it's too big for me.
lt just makes me insecure
to see a TV that big.
- But you can get anything on it.
- Oh, yeah, football.
You like football ? The ball
Comes right into your room, huh ?
- You like to go to football games ?
- Yes, l do.
Open up for me.
Season tickets.
- You'll love this thing.
- l love it.
- lt's very expensive.
- l know. Thanks a million.
Okay, okay.
Help. We need help.
[ Bird Chirping ]
[ Brooks Narrating ]
Well, the storm had passed.
By the middle of February,
my filmmaking dream had Come true.
J had a happy family,
a beautiful city...
and a chance to show the French
what a montage was all about.
And then,
something happened.
Still moving at a leisurely pace,
the Yeagers were shocked...
when they picked up the Sunday
edition of the Arizona Republic,
dated February 1 9th.
On page one of part ''B''...
was the first in a series of
five articles from a new book.
The book was called
Nightmare in the Desert.
I稚s author,
Dr. Theodore Cleary.
Apparently, Cleary took
his notes from the Journal...
and decided to make
the fast buck.
Stringing together a bunch
of familiar catchphrases...
Like ''mind control''
and ''psychological rape, ''
Like ''mind control''
and ''psychological rape, ''
he wrote one of
those quickie books,
the kind you peddle to publishers
who missed out on Watergate.
Howard, please don't Come into
my house and read crap, okay ?
lf you want to do it,
stay at the hotel.
Albert, you oughta
read this, really.
Ask any great entertainer.
They don't read bad reviews.
''Out of sight, out of mind.''
Jolson said it.
He, uh--
He says you're dangerous.
They called Babe Ruth
dangerous, hmm ?
He also says
you're paranoid.
They called Babe Ruth
paranoid, too.
I知 making a special breakfast.
lf you want to eat it, no reading.
[ Telephone Rings ]
- Hello ?
- [ Woman ] Hi. Did you read it ?
Hi, Mitz.
I知 reading it Now.
What do they mean,
you're like prisoners of war ?
- l wanna finish reading.
- What's going on over there ?
- [ Doorbell Rings ]
- I値l get it.
No, Honey.
No, l-I値l get it.
[ Doorbell ]
- Yes ?
- Mr. Yeager?
- Dr. Yeager.
- I知 sorry.
Jim Sanders, Channel 5 News.
Can we Come in ?
- W-What can l do for you ?
- lt's kind of windy out there.
- Mind if we Come in for a minute?
- Yeah, all right.
- Thank you.
- Hey, you're from TV, Channel 1 2 !
You're close. Channel 5.
Js that your girl?
Yeah. What can l do for you ?
We're in the middle of breakfast.
Listen. l don't wanna interrupt.
You go right ahead.
We're following up on that story
in the paper this morning.
You know, the one about
the-the ''bizarre Phoenix family.''
lt looks like we Got a national news
story right in our backyard here,
and, well, l-l wondered if we could
film you guys having breakfast.
- Would that be okay ?
- Well, they're already doing it.
Oh, uh--
What's that thing ?
- lt's a camera.
- Oh, yeah ? Look at that.
- l wonder How we can work that in.
- Uh, excuse me one second.
l wanna make a quick call.
W-Would you just excuse me ?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Hey, listen. One thing.
The paper kind of implies there's a
sort of brainwashing going on here.
- Would you comment on that ?
- Excuse me just one second.
Can l take that
to mean yes ?
[ Dialing Phone Number ]
- Hello ?
- Albert ? Warren.
- Hi.
- Could you Come here right away ?
- Let me eat first, babe.
- No, please don't eat first.
-A news crew's here from Channel 1 2.
-Channel 5.
- What ? [ Hangs Up ]
- Channel 5.
Albert ?
Albert ?
- [ Hangs Up ]
- NO, no. Come On.
The fella you wanna see
will be right over.
Oh, yeah.
This is, uh, Ted Cleary, huh ?
- No. Albert Brooks.
- Right.
- [ Sanders ] He's what ?
- [ Yeager ] How do you mean ?
I知 tryin'to get all the positions.
So many names in that article.
l-l can't tell who
was who, frankly.
- May l help you ?
- Yeah. You're Al, right ?
- I知 Albert, yes.
- Hey, great. Channel 5 News, Al.
Listen, we're doin' some follow-up
on that story in the paper.
- Uh-huh.
- Dr. Yeager was tellin' me...
that you're filming him
and his family having breakfast.
- Uh-huh.
- l thought maybe when you're done,
if you could put on another quick
little breakfast for us to film,
- it'd really help us out.
- l beg your pardon ?
l don't say this
On every story l go Out On,
but this thing feels big,
it really feels good,
and everybody in town's
gonna be on it.
But since we're the first here, l
thought we'd get something special.
- Feels big, huh ? Feels good ?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Get out ! You're trespassing !
- Hey, Leo !
-Get film on this guy !
-Get nothing ! You're trespassing !
- Trespassing ! This is a set !
- Wait a minute !
- This is a news story !
- This is copyrighted !
- Get out of here !
- Somebody's lying !
Hum a few bars
and figure it out !
-Just move !
- l want film on this guy.
No, you don't !
Get out of here !
l want to tell you something.
This started out to be a puff piece.
-Uh-huh.
-Now you Got me a little pissed off.
I知 gonna get outta here, and I知
gonna Come back with a court order !
- Court order ?
- That's right, a court order !
I値l get the biggest lawyer in this
country down to this jerkwater burg!
You'll see a jury turn against you
so fast, you won't know what hit !
- Mr. Cleary, you'll regret this.
- lt's Mr. Brooks !
And don't threaten me !
l work much better out of pressure !
Get Out !
lt's fine. Go back.
Have a good breakfast.
I値l be across the street.
I値l take a shower.
[ Brooks ]
The shower didn't help.
[ Horn Honking ]
[ Man ]
Mr. Yeager !
[ Brooks Narrating ] The media
stayed away from the Yeagers'house.
However, off their property
they were fair game.
It started
on Monday afternoon.
Coming home from lunch, Dr. and Mrs.
Yeager encountered a Live Eye truck.
- l don't wanna talk to you.
- lt won't take long. Come on.
-People are awful worried about you.
-I知 sorry, I知 sorry.
- Please.
- Excuse us.
Come on, talk to us.
Dr. Yeager !
- [ Horn Honking ]
- Mrs. Yeager !
[ Brooks ]
Tuesday afternoon.
Wait, Mrs. Yeager !
Are they hurting you ?
While returning
from a shopping spree,
Mrs. Yeager and the children
were accosted.
- Lisa, Eric.
- We have a lot of viewers--
You would think the news
would have something better to do...
in a city this size.
- l have no comment at this time.
- Please, Mrs. Yeager.
Wait just a moment. How about your
children ? How are they holding up ?
- Everything is just fine. Please.
- How old are your children ?
Dr. Yeager, can we get
a couple of words with--
Can you take just a second ?
Doctor ? Doctor ?
What are they doin' to you ?
Are they tryin' to hurt you ?
- Look over here, Dr. Yeager.
- Are they hurting you ?
- Can you give us a minute ?
- Give me a smile.
- Dr. and Mrs. Yeager.
- No comment. No comment.
-Why did you Come to see this film ?
-Please, please.
- Can you tell me this ?
- No comment on the film ?
- NO comment.
- Will you see the second feature ?
- Kids, don't say anything.
- Dr. Yeager, over here !
-Were you forced to see this movie ?
-Over here !
As you know, Albert, some
members of the institute--
[ Brooks ] An emergency meeting
was called for 6.?00 P.M....
on Saturday the 25th.
It was requested by the head...
of the National Institute of Human
behavior, Dr. Isaac Steven Hayward.
...entirely a new field,
the psychological--
And approved
by Martin Brand,
who considered the meeting important
enough to call from Catalina,
interrupting the first vacation
he'd had in over a week.
Albert, we're
known in Europe--
As J sat across the table
from this man,
J was slowly losing my respect
for higher education.
Also, he wore
far too much cologne.
When you have a reputation
in as difficult a field as this,
you've Got to maintain it.
And you think
something's going on here...
that's preventing you from
maintaining your reputation ?
- l have no opinion.
- Pfft !
But we've done a great many tests
in the last five days--
from public opinion surveys
to urinalyses of our own staff.
Fine. What do
the tests tell you ?
They indicate to us
that our efforts here...
have Come to the end
of their useful life.
Anything beyond this point
would be severely counterproductive.
l see.
Now it's becoming clear.
The institute gets
a little heat, and boom !
They not only leave the kitchen,
they take the kitchen with them !
Let's consider the family
for a moment.
Oh, what'd you do ?
Run urine tests on them too ?
We did a series on them, yes.
Thanks, Howie. Hope you
didn't get your hands wet.
[ Brand ]
Come on ! Jesus Christ!
Look. These people are close to
complete personality disintegration.
Oh, don't make me laugh.
l don't remember a time in life...
when l haven't been close
to personality disintegration.
And How the hell would you know what
these people are feeling, anyway ?
- From your Mickey Mouse tests ?
- Don't blame the tests.
l don't blame 'em. They're great.
Why don't we do more, huh ?
l bet you'd like it,
wouldn't you, Noland ?
Wanna get that cup again ?
I鱈L get you Jots of cups.
Maybe a hundred cups ! I値l tell
you something about you people.
You're great with cups,
but what you don't have are balls!
lf you ask any magician, he'll
tell you that cups without balls...
doesn't mean jack shit !
[ Brand ] Albert, what the hell
are you talking about ?
Look, let's not argue.
Say the family's fine.
Say the family's perfect.
Let's talk about you for a minute.
Look what you've done.
You failed, that's what you did.
You schmuck, you failed.
You started out with this reality
crap, and what did you end up with ?
The news ! The goddamn news !
People get that for free.
You think somebody's
gonna hire a baby-sitter,
take a taxicab,
go all the way the hell downtown,
go up to the box office,
shell out four bucks...
and say, ''Here ! Here !
Here's my four dollars !
What time does
the news go on''?
''Here. Here's
my four dollars.''
ls money your
entire life, Martin ?
Money ! Money ! Let's talk about
human beings for a minute !
Across the street
are four people.
These people had a dream.
They took on a project.
lt was new,
it was exciting,
and it was supposed to go
a whole year, not two months !
I知 in show business. I知 used to
my commitments being dumped on.
But these people are ordinary
people with ordinary feelings.
DO you wanna go across
the street and tell them ?
NO ! You won't even
Come down here !
- Do you want that responsibility ?
-Just a minute.
l think they know more than
you give them credit for.
Oh, look who's talking.
The pee hoarder.
[ Doorbell ]
Someone should
answer the door.
Why ? Why not take
a urinalysis of it ?
Then we'll know who it is without
going. lsn't that a great idea ?
Come on, Noland!
More data ! More data !
We need more data.
Come on, Dr. Cup ! More data !
More data, huh ?
Get some data for me! More data !
More data ! More data !
We need more, more.
Hi. What a breath
of fresh air.
Please, Come in.
Here are your tests,
your living tests.
Dr. and Mrs. Yeager, I知 in
the communications business,
and it's my job
to get through to these people,
but J don't think
I知 doing very good at it.
l don't think they understand the
meaning of the word ''commitment,''
the word
''dedication.''
Maybe you can
explain it to them.
- We wanna stop.
- What ?
- This is over.
- NO.
l don't wanna get into any more
of your intellectual arguments.
This is ruining our lives.
This is not what we bargained for.
There was no bargaining.
You applied, we accepted.
Albert, the children are
afraid to go to school.
That's normal.
Look, l don't care
what you think is normal.
We no longer wanna be involved
in this. That's final. That's it.
- This was the family's decision.
- Oh, I値l bet it was.
- I知 sure Eric Got a full vote.
- We're not gonna discuss this.
Okay, no discussion. Just a few
facts and loose ends. $25,000.
That's more than half your money was
due on the completion of this film.
l don't think this is the end,
and l think you're gonna have
to go without the boat...
and the trailer you've been
talking about, and Lisa's braces.
l know something about teeth.
She may look all right Now.
ln three years she'll
be an elephant girl.
These Come right
down to her waist.
And also, if something,
God forbid, really bad happens,
you have no insurance, you're
not in the Screen Actors Guild,
- you'll get no benefits.
- Stop it!
With what they've been through,
we pay them and forget about it.
Okay, we'll forget about it.
Go ahead, take the money.
Go ahead. I知 gonna get the family
that l wanted to choose anyway.
- What was their name ?
- The Feltons.
The Feltons, Wisconsin !
That's the heart of this country.
Here's what l say. We all take a
week off. I値l get a high colonic.
Then we'll Come back with
a new family, a bigger institute--
[ Brand ]
And another studio !
We're not spending another
dime on this picture !
You're nuts to wanna
do this again.
-Don't call me nuts ! You're nuts !
-You're nuts !
- You're nuts ! You're nuts !
- You're nuts !
- You're nuts ! You're nuts !
- Oh, you schmuck.
- [ Both ] You're nuts!
- [ Brand ] I知 hangin'up !
- [ Brooks ] You're nuts!
- [ Dial Tone ]
No, no, no ! Wait !
Please, wait ! Oh, wait, wait !
Let's think about me
for just one second.
Dr. Yeager, animals
don't go to movies.
You think 6,000 dogs are gonna
Come out of Radio City going,
''Hmm, l didn't like
the vet so much'' ?
No, no. l have to deal with
people like John Simon and Rex Reed.
Have you ever met these people ?
They're killers.
What are they gonna see ?
January and February in Phoenix ?
You think that's
gonna do it for me ?
l Got nothin' on you.
l Got no birthdays.
J don't have any holidays.
J Got nothing.
Where am l gonna be July 4th ?
Sitting alone in L.A. ?
No. l wanna be here
with you, filming you.
Where am l gonna be Halloween ?
Sitting alone ? No.
l wanna follow Lisa around
in her cute little costume.
What about Thanksgiving ?
l wanna see you eat the ham.
l wanna watch you
carve up the ham.
And Christmas ?
Oh, please.
l wanna be here
for Christmas !
l want that
1 2-foot tree...
with the angel hair
and the popcorn balls !
- [ Yeager ] Albert.
- Please !
- Albert, Albert, please.
- Please !
- Please, Albert.
- I知 fine.
[ Sobbing ]
Folks, we're going to need
your signatures on some disclaimers,
and some, uh,
statements on film.
Just a few
short seconds.
[ Door Opens ]
Albert ?
Albert, here.
- What is it ?
- Valium.
Thanks. What am l gonna wash
it down with ? Urine, Howard ?
Go on, Albert, take it.
It'll be good for you.
Thanks for being so considerate.
You were a big help at the table.
Why don't you get
the disclaimers ?
-Just go get the disclaimers.
- Okay.
Oh, my God.
Mr. Brooks ?
- How did this happen ?
- Are you okay ?
- l put some coffee on.
- Thank you.
Folks, uh, if you don't mind,
we'll just have you sign these.
These are standard forms relating
to limitations of liability.
I知 sure you have your clients
sign much the same thing, Doctor.
And while you're doing that,
I値l ask you some questions...
and get your answers
on film.
This would normally be done at the
end of the project-- which this is.
What a sad day.
I知 a big jerk.
l ruined their life.
How did l do it ?
l didn't mean to do it.
I知 a failure.
I知 a failure.
You're not
a failure.
Yes, l am.
I知 a failure.
How did it happen ?
l had good intentions.
- Hey, it can't be that bad.
- Look.
You heard what he said.
His kids can't go to school.
They're all screwed up.
They'll never be the same again.
Why do l even make movies ?
l have no right to make movies.
l shouldn't be allowed to do this.
''Did any representative of
the lnstitute of Human Behavior...
''at any time interfere with the
normal conduct of your business...
or family Life ?''
Oh, keeping in mind...
that Mr. Brooks is not connected
with the lnstitute.
- Oh, no.
- You know what l Gotta go do Now ?
l Gotta go put this on...
and go down to a children's hospital
and make kids laugh.
- l can't do it.
- Hospital?
lt's a benefit. l committed to it
weeks ago, but l can't do it.
l can't be the happy clown.
What am l gonna say to 'em ?
''Hello, kids. My movie just
Got screwed up, but that's okay.
Get well, 'cause someday you'll
go out and have some jerk film you.''
Why did l pick reality ? Why did l
pick that out of all the subjects ?
l don't know anything about it.
What was l doing ?
I知 a stupid,
stupid jerk.
''Were you coerced
in any way...
- to participate in this project ?''
- NO.
Maybe I知 overreacting.
Stop me if l do it.
l overreact a lot.
lt's good, huh ? lt's good ?
- Yeah.
- l shouldn't be hard on myself.
You're right. lt's a good movie.
We Got nice things.
We Got animals, we Got kids,
we Got sunny days.
What else do you want ?
So it ended eight months early.
Like an abortion.
lt's an abortion.
I知 involved in an abortion.
Oh, God, I知 in big trouble.
''You suffered no financial damage
as a result of any dealings...
- with our representatives ?''
- NO.
''Nor did you assume any
financial obligations...
''which might result in any claims
against the institute...
- by third parties ?''
- NO, no.
l mean, they were gonna
give me a year, a whole year.
l was gonna do somethin' nice.
l was gonna end with New Year's !
Up ! Up !
The beginning ! New !
Somethin' so audiences
can go home and smile. But this ?
''Would this experience prejudice you
against participating in...
other types of audience or marketing
research at some future date ?''
l don't think so.
- Well, not a live-in.
- Not a live-in, no.
l never thought l'd say this.
The studio is right.
The audience loves fake.
They crave fake.
Reality sucks.
l can do fake.
I知 capable.
l just won't get a chance.
l won't ever be able to work again.
- Come on, take it easy.
- Okay, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
lt's not too late.
We can end this movie fake.
We can end it big.
We can end it up.
We can send the people home happy.
- Mr. Brooks !
- What ? What ?
There's no law that says, what,
''Start real, can't end fake'' ?
What are they gonna do ? Put me
in movie jail ? lt's a fake jail.
What's the biggest movie
ever made ? Come on.
We'll take, we'll borrow.
That's the meaning of art.
You borrow a little, a little,
put it together, it's something new.
What's the biggest movie ?
Star Wars. How did it end ?
- You okay ?
- Zoom ! They blew up a planet !
They blew up a planet !
Fantastic ! We can do that !
What's the trick ?
How did they do it ?

''Has your association
with the institute...
benefitted your life
in any way ?''
l'd like to think
about that a little.
- What's the second biggest film ?
- Hmm.
laws. All right, laws.
Ooh, this is a good idea.
This is a good idea !
l can save this picture !
Jaws.
Oh, my God, Pete.
There is a gigantic fish at the zoo.
l remember when we were down there.
The zookeeper's a fan of mine.
He'll let us in tonight.
l can get the family down there
in the middle of the night.
We'll have this confrontation--
gigantic fish, family.
They'll meet.
I値l put music behind it.

Do-do, do-do, do-do ?
I知 mentally ill.
