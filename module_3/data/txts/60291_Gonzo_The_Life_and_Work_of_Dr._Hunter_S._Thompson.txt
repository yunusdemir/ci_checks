( peeping )
( faint TV sportscaster
speaking )
...handoff
on the left side.
...first down, Hunter's
out at the 20-yard line
and a big...
Sondi Wright:
HE'D KNOWN FOR
A LONG TIME
THAT HE WAS NO LONGER
A REALLY GOOD WRITER.
HE HAD SPURTS.
Douglas Brinkley:
HE LOST THAT GONZO EDGE.
( TV sports announcer
resumes )
Tom Wolfe:
I WONDER WHAT'S
HAPPENING TO OLD HUNTER.
HE'S KIND OF LOSING IT.
Charles Perry:
CREATIVELY, HE HAD WRITTEN
ALL HIS GREAT STUFF.
HE HADN'T
BEEN REALLY PRODUCTIVE
FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS.
I THINK HE JUST HAD
RUN OUT OF JUICE.
Brinkley:
IN HUNTER'S LAST YEARS--
IN ORDER TO REALLY GET
THE JUICES STIRRED UP
IN HIM--
IN WHAT WE CALL
QUINTESSENTIAL HUNTER--
IT TOOK SOMETHING LIKE--
IT HAD TO ALMOST A FEEL
LIKE A KICK IN THE GROIN.
Johnny Depp:
"IT WAS JUST AFTER DAWN
IN WOODY CREEK, COLORADO,
WHEN THE FIRST PLANE HIT
THE WORLD TRADE CENTER
IN NEW YORK CITY
ON TUESDAY MORNING.
AND AS USUAL I WAS
WRITING ABOUT SPORTS,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.
FOOTBALL SUDDENLY
SEEMED IRRELEVANT
COMPARED TO
THE SCENES OF DESTRUCTION
AND UTTER DEVASTATION
COMING OUT
OF NEW YORK ON TV."
( "All Along the Watchtower"
playing )
"THE TOWERS ARE GONE NOW,
REDUCED TO BLOODY RUBBLE,
ALONG WITH ALL HOPES
FOR PEACE IN OUR TIME--
IN THE UNITED STATES
OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY."
( rock music continues )
"MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT:
WE ARE AT WAR NOW."
* "THERE MUST BE
SOME WAY OUT OF HERE" *
* SAID THE JOKER
TO THE THIEF... *
Depp:
"IT WILL BE A RELIGIOUS WAR--
A SORT OF CHRISTIAN JIHAD
FUELED BY RELIGIOUS HATRED
AND LED BY MERCILESS
FANATICS ON BOTH SIDES--
GUERRILLA WARFARE
ON A GLOBAL SCALE
WITH NO FRONT LINES
AND NO IDENTIFIABLE ENEMY."
* ALL ALONG
THE WATCHTOWER *
* PRINCES KEPT THE VIEW
* WHILE ALL THE WOMEN
CAME AND WENT... *
Depp:
"WE'RE GONNA PUNISH
SOMEBODY FOR THIS ATTACK,
BUT JUST WHO OR WHAT
WILL BE BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS
IS HARD TO SAY--
MAYBE AFGHANISTAN,
MAYBE PAKISTAN OR IRAQ."
* TWO RIDERS
WERE APPROACHING *
* THE WIND BEGAN
TO HOWL. *
"THIS IS GOING TO BE
A VERY EXPENSIVE WAR,
AND VICTORY IS NOT
GUARANTEED FOR ANYONE--
AND CERTAINLY NOT
FOR ANYONE AS BAFFLED
AS GEORGE W BUSH.
HE WILL DECLARE
A NATIONAL SECURITY EMERGENCY
AND CLAMP DOWN HARD
ON EVERYBODY, NO MATTER
WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHY.
WINSTON CHURCHILL
ONCE SAID,
'THE FIRST CASUALTY OF WAR
IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.'
THE LID IS ON.
LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
THAT MIGHT GIVE AID
TO THE ENEMY."
TV anchor:
A giant of the written
word has died.
Hunter S Thompson
was a lot of things--
a journalist,
an author, a patriot,
a professional
troublemaker,
a complex
walking monument
to misbehavior
who apparently
took his own life
with a gun last night.
Depp:
"IT WAS ALWAYS AT NIGHT,
LIKE A WEREWOLF,
THAT I WOULD
TAKE THE THING OUT
FOR AN HONEST RUN
DOWN THE COAST.
I WOULD START
IN GOLDEN GATE PARK,
THINKING ONLY
TO RUN A FEW LONG CURVES
TO CLEAR MY HEAD."
( rock music playing )
"THE MOMENTARY FREEDOM
OF THE PARK WAS LIKE
THE ONE UNLUCKY DRINK
THAT SHOVES A WAVERING
ALCOHOLIC OFF THE WAGON.
BUT IN A MATTER OF MINUTES,
I'D BE OUT AT THE BEACH
WITH THE SOUND
OF THE ENGINE IN MY EARS,
THE SURF BOOMING UP
ON THE SEA WALL
AND A FINE EMPTY ROAD
STRETCHING ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO SANTA CRUZ.
THERE WAS NO HELMET
ON THOSE NIGHTS,
NO SPEED LIMIT
AND NO COOLING IT DOWN
AROUND THE CURVES.
THEN INTO SECOND GEAR,
FORGETTING THE CARS
AND LETTING THE BEAST
WIND OUT-- 35, 45.
THEN INTO THIRD,
NOT WORRIED ABOUT GREEN
OR RED SIGNALS
BUT ONLY SOME OTHER
WEREWOLF LOONY.
NOW THERE IS NO SOUND
EXCEPT WIND.
THE NEEDLE
LEANS DOWN ON 100,
AND WIND-BURNED EYEBALLS
STRAIN TO SEE DOWN
THE CENTERLINE--
NO ROOM AT ALL
FOR MISTAKES.
THAT'S WHEN
THE STRANGE MUSIC STARTS."
* IN THE NIGHT
* THOUGH WE'RE APART... *
Depp:
"THE EDGE-- THERE IS
NO HONEST WAY TO EXPLAIN IT
BECAUSE THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO REALLY KNOW WHERE IT IS
ARE THE ONES
WHO HAVE GONE OVER.
THE OTHERS--
THE LIVING--
ARE THOSE WHO PUSHED THEIR
CONTROL AS FAR AS THEY FELT
THEY COULD HANDLE IT,
AND THEN PULLED BACK,
OR SLOWED DOWN.
BUT THE EDGE...
IS STILL OUT THERE."
Man:
What is your name,
please?
My name is
Hunter Thompson.
My name is
Hunter Thompson.
- My name is Hunter Thompson.
- ( rock music playing )
Sonny Barger:
I MET HUNTER IN THE '60s
A SHORT TIME BEFORE
HE WROTE THE BOOK ON US.
AND HE WENT ON TO BECOME
PROBABLY ONE
OF THE GREATEST WRITERS
THAT AMERICA WILL EVER HAVE.
DOESN'T MEAN HE ISN'T
A JERK IN MY EYES,
BUT HE'S
A VERY GOOD WRITER.
Wolfe:
HUNTER REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF MARK TWAIN.
HE WAS A REPORTER-- TWAIN
STARTED OUT AS A REPORTER--
WITH A WILD IMAGINATION
AND HE'S NOT
TRYING TO FOOL YOU.
YOU KNOW IMMEDIATELY THAT
HE IS FILTERING REALITY
THROUGH WHAT HUNTER
CALLED GONZO.
Man:
Will the real Hunter
Thompson please stand up?
Wright:
WILL THE REAL HUNTER
THOMPSON STAND UP?
- ( laughing )
- ( applause )
THAT WAS BEFORE I UNDERSTOOD
WHAT ALL THAT WAS GOING TO MEAN.
( sniffs, mumbles )
OOPS, ARE WE MARKING?
OH, NO! GOD!
HELP US, JESUS!
I KNOW IT.
IT'S IN MY INTEREST--
MAYBE IN THE INTEREST
OF GREATEST GOOD--
FOR ME TO SMOKE
A JOINT AND CALM DOWN.
Jimmy Carter:
HE WAS NOT AFRAID
TO ROCK THE BOAT,
TO CHALLENGE
THE ESTABLISHMENT
AND EXPRESS HIMSELF
IN UNIQUE AND RADICAL,
SOMETIMES SHOCKING, WAYS.
Pat Buchanan:
HE DESCRIBED ME AS
A HALF-CRAZED DAVY CROCKETT
RUNNING AROUND THE PARAPETS
OF NIXON'S ALAMO.
WE WERE ALL AMUSED
BY HIM.
HE WAS AN INTERESTING GUY
TO BE AROUND.
HE ASKED YOU
UNEXPECTED QUESTIONS.
MOST PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED
THAT I WALK ON TWO LEGS.
I THINK PEOPLE THINK
I'M... VERY MUCH--
MAYBE A VIOLENT VERSION
OF THAT COMIC STRIP.
THIS IS THE LAST DRAWING
I DID OF HIM SO FAR.
"MY GOD! I MUSTA MISSED--
IT'S HELL DOWN HERE!!"
( chuckles )
Ralph Steadman:
HE'S PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES
AS MUCH AS HE COULD.
LIFE TO HIM WAS
THE CHALLENGE.
HE WAS GONNA BE DEAD
AT 30, ANYWAY,
SO NOW HE WAS LIVING
ON BORROWED TIME.
( Hunter over phone )
"DEAR HUNTER,
IT IS OVER A YEAR
SINCE YOU SET THE SCENE
FOR YOUR STRANGELY-
PLANNED SUICIDE.
THE MESSAGES THAT I HAVE
RECEIVED FROM YOU
UP TO THE BUSH/KERRY
ELECTION OF 2004
WERE INFECTED
BY A DISMAL UNDERTONE.
'IF BUSH WINS,' YOU SAID,
'THE PLANET IS DOOMED.'
WHEN YOU PULLED
THE TRIGGER ON YOUR MAGNUM .44,
MY FIRST
REACTION WAS TO SAY,
'ABOUT BLOODY TIME.
HE'S BEEN THREATENING
TO DO THAT FOR YEARS.'
YOU WERE
NEVER REASONABLE,
AND YOU KNEW,
IN SPITE
OF YOUR WAYWARD SPIRIT,
YOU WERE NOT INVINCIBLE.
THOSE WHO
GREW TO BE A THREAT
TO YOUR AMERICA
CONTINUE TO BURGEON.
FOR YOU, IT WAS
VICTORY OR GAME OVER.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO HANG
AROUND AND NAIL THE BEAUTY
OF THAT IMAGE
OF ABSOLUTE EVIL.
BUT YOU LEAVE US
WITH A BLUEPRINT,
OLD SPORT.
TAKE IT UP
WITH THE GODS.
SEND WORD.
RALPH."
Wright:
I THINK HE WAS IMPORTANT
IN A LITERARY WAY
AND ALSO
IN A POLITICAL WAY.
AND I THINK THAT
HIS STORY IS TRAGIC.
HE WAS LOVING.
HE WAS GENEROUS.
ON THE OTHER END
OF THE SPECTRUM,
THE BOY IN THE MAN
WAS ABSOLUTELY VICIOUS.
GOD DAMN, YOU DUMBASS!
REACH UNDER THERE
- AND GET SOME
GODDAMNED MEDICINE!
- Man: OVER HERE?
TO THE RIGHT.
Anita Thompson:
HUNTER HAD TWO EXTREMES
IN HIM
THAT HE LIVED WITH
CONSTANTLY--
THE GENEROUS,
BEAUTIFUL HUNTER
AND THE SCARY,
MEAN, CRUEL HUNTER.
AND HE WAS AWARE
OF BOTH.
I DON'T KNOW IF HE WAS
IN CONTROL OF BOTH
ALL THE TIME,
BUT HE WAS CERTAINLY
AWARE OF BOTH.
AND THEY BECAME
PRESENT IN HIS LIFE
WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG--
BOTH SIDES.
( jazz music playing )
Brinkley:
YOU'VE GOTTA GO BACK
TO LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY,
TO UNDERSTAND HIM.
HIS FATHER DIED WHEN
HE WAS YOUNG.
SO YOU HAD A MOTHER
RAISING THREE BOYS
ON A LIBRARIAN SALARY.
HE LIVED-- IT WASN'T
EVEN MIDDLE CLASS,
IT WAS A LOWER-
MIDDLE-CLASS EXISTENCE.
HIS FRIENDS WERE THE RICH
KIDS OF LOUISVILLE,
THE ONES THAT
HAD ALL THE PRIVILEGE.
SO HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THE RAILROAD TRACKS.
YET, HUNTER WAS VERY SMART,
NATURALLY INTELLIGENT,
AND HE ALWAYS FELT
A BIT LIKE THE OUTSIDER.
HE WAS A REAL HELLION
ON VANDALISM.
THE SEMINAL EXPERIENCE
WAS WHEN HE AND A GROUP
OF BUDDIES
WERE PARTYING
AND SMOKING CIGARETTES
AND DRINKING BEER.
THEY WERE ALL ARRESTED.
THE RICH KIDS WHO KNEW
THE JUDGES GOT OUT.
HUNTER NEVER GOT TO WALK
FOR GRADUATION.
HE WAS IN JAIL.
Depp:
"I COULD SEE THE MOON
HUNG HIGH IN THE SKY
WITH A MOCKING GRIN
ON HIS FACE.
I SEIZED THE BARS,
AND SHRIEKED AND WAILED
LIKE A SOUL
WHO'S LOST IN HELL."
Wright:
ESSENTIALLY, INSIDE...
HUNTER WAS AN AGONIZED
HUMAN BEING.
BUT HE ALSO FELT
LIKE HE HAD
THE POTENTIAL
OF BEING
A REALLY GREAT WRITER.
Brinkley:
"THE GREAT GATSBY" IS HOW
HUNTER LEARNED TO WRITE.
HE WOULD TYPE
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
OVER AND OVER AGAIN
JUST TO LEARN
THE MUSIC OF FITZGERALD.
"THE GREAT GATSBY"
WAS FILLED WITH ANGER
THAT THE WHOLE DEAL
IN AMERICAN LIFE WAS RIGGED.
HUNTER IDENTIFIED
WITH FITZGERALD I'D SAY
MORE THAN ANY OTHER WRITER.
THE DIFFERENCE IS
FITZGERALD WOULD LOOK IN
ON THE CANDY STORE WINDOW,
LOOK IN ON THE STOREFRONTS
OF THE RICH.
HUNTER WANTED
TO SMASH THE WINDOWS.
Wright:
HUNTER WAS EXTREMELY
SEDUCTIVE.
I WAS VERY ATTRACTED
TO HUNTER.
HIS ENERGY
WAS JUST PHENOMENAL.
HE WROTE EVERY DAY.
HE WAS GETTING PAID
$100 FOR AN ARTICLE
OR SOMETHING,
BUT WE WERE VERY POOR.
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT
WITH MY SON,
HUNTER SHOT ELK
AND I ATE ELK LIVER,
MILK AND SALAD, PERIOD.
THAT'S ALL I ATE.
Brinkley:
HERE WAS A GUY
STRUGGLING.
HE HAD HIS WIFE SONDI
WITH HIM.
HE WAS LIVING
ON A FREELANCER,
CHECK TO CHECK,
BARELY ABLE TO PAY RENT.
SO WHEN HE GOT
THE ASSIGNMENT
FROM CAREY MCWILLIAMS
OF "THE NATION"
TO WRITE ABOUT THIS
PHENOMENON-- HELL'S ANGELS--
IT WAS A BIG DEAL.
Man:
"I, Hunter Thompson,
am a writer.
Recently, I spent
over a year living
in close contact
with a notorious
California motorcycle gang
which is the basis
of my new book,
'Hell's Angels.'"
- Signed
"Hunter Thompson."
- ( applause )
Uh, number two,
approximately how many members
do the Hell's Angels have?
It varies.
Anywhere from--
I'd say 100 to 200.
( rock music playing )
Brinkley:
HUNTER INFILTRATED
THE STORY.
HE CONSIDERED HIMSELF
A PHOTOJOURNALIST.
IN HIS EARLY
APPLICATIONS FOR JOBS,
HE WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER.
Depp:
"THE SIGHT OF A PHOTOGRAPHER
INVARIABLY WHIPS THE ANGELS
INTO A KISSING FRENZY.
THIS IS A GUARANTEED
SQUARE-JOLTER,
AND THE ANGELS
ARE GLEEFULLY AWARE
OF THE REACTION IT GETS.
'THEY CAN'T STAND IT,'
SAYS TERRY.
'IT BLOWS THEIR MINDS
EVERY TIME--
ESPECIALLY
THE TONGUE BIT.'"
Wolfe: IT IS ONE
OF THE BRAVURA PIECES
OF REPORTING OF ALL TIME.
HE ACTUALLY, AS THEY SAY,
RAN WITH THE ANGELS FOR--
HE WAS EMBEDDED,
YOU KNOW?
HE WAS EMBEDDED
IN THE HELL'S ANGELS
BATTALION.
( rock music playing )
Depp:
"THE MENACE IS LOOSE AGAIN.
THE HELL'S ANGELS,
THE 100-CARAT HEADLINE,
RUNNING FAST AND LOUD
ON THE EARLY-MORNING FREEWAY
LIKE GENGHIS KHAN
ON AN IRON HORSE...
A MONSTROUS STEED
WITH A FIERY ANUS,
FLAT OUT THROUGH
THE EYE OF A BEER CAN
AND UP YOUR DAUGHTER'S LEG
WITH NO QUARTER ASKED
AND NONE GIVEN."
Brinkley:
IT WAS THE BEGINNING
OF HUNTER
DEVELOPING HIS STYLE.
IT IS NOT GONZO,
IT'S NOT SURREAL.
IT IS STRAIGHT JOURNALISM,
BUT IT'S PARTICIPATORY.
Depp:
"WEIRD AS IT SEEMS, AS THIS
GANG OF COSTUMED HOODLUMS
CONVERGED ON MONTEREY
THAT MORNING
THEY WERE ON THE VERGE
OF 'MAKING IT BIG,'
AS THE SHOWBIZ
PEOPLE SAY,
AND THEY WOULD OWE
MOST OF THEIR SUCCESS
TO A CURIOUS RAPE MANIA
THAT RIDES
ON THE SHOULDER
OF AMERICAN JOURNALISM
LIKE SOME JEERING,
MASTURBATING RAVEN.
NOTHING GRABS AN EDITOR'S
EYE LIKE A GOOD RAPE.
TO THEM, THE APPEARANCE
OF THE HELL'S ANGELS
MUST HAVE SEEMED
LIKE A WONDERFUL
PUBLICITY STUNT."
HELL'S ANGELS ACCUSED
OF RAPE AND PERVERSION,
THEFT, NARCOTICS
AND VIOLENCE.
AND THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL SAYS,
"THEY WILL NO LONGER BE
ALLOWED TO THREATEN
THE LIVES,
THE PEACE AND SECURITY
OF HONEST CITIZENS.
HELL'S ANGELS ARE
THE BIGGEST
OF THE OUTLAW
MOTORCYCLE CLUBS."
OH, SHIT!
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.
( engine revs )
Depp:
"IN A NATION
OF FRIGHTENED DULLARDS
THERE'S ALWAYS A SORRY
SHORTAGE OF OUTLAWS,
AND THOSE FEW
WHO MAKE THE GRADE
ARE ALWAYS WELCOME.
THE HELL'S ANGELS POSE
FOR TELEVISION CAMERAMEN
AND ANSWERED QUESTIONS
ON RADIO CALL-IN SHOWS.
THEY WERE SOUGHT OUT
BY MYSTICS AND POETS,
CHEERED ON
BY STUDENT REBELS
AND INVITED TO PARTIES
GIVEN BY LIBERALS AND
INTELLECTUALS."
Number two,
who is the author
that sort of leads
the kind of LSD sect
out there
in Los--
San Francisco?
Ken Kesey.
Number two,
the Merry Pranksters
gave a party
for the Hell's Angels--
were you there?
- --that lasted two days?
- Yes.
WE'RE GOING
OUT ON AN OUTING--
ON A SUNDAY OUTING.
OH, THIS IS LOVELY.
YOU KNOW, OUR LITTLE FAMILY.
AND SO WE ENDED UP--
HUNTER SAID,
"OH, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING'S HAPPENING OVER--
LET'S GO JUST KIND
OF CHECK IT OUT."
THE BIG BANNERS
OUT THERE SAYING
"THE MERRY PRANKSTERS
WELCOME THE HELL'S ANGELS."
I THOUGHT I WAS
HAVING A LOT OF FUN.
JUAN WAS IN THE CAR ASLEEP.
EVERYBODY WAS ON ACID.
I WASN'T.HUNTER WASN'T.
HE HADN'T TAKEN ACID YET.
AND EVERYBODY IS
PRETTY HAPPY AND DANCING
AND THEN WATCHING
THIS FIVE-HOUR FILM
OR SOMETHING
KESEY HAD PUT TOGETHER.
AND WHEN WE LEFT...
HUNTER SAID,
"DID YOU KNOW WHAT
WAS HAPPENING IN THERE?"
AND I SAID,
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN?"
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THERE WAS
A GANGBANG GOING ON."
Hunter:
I'm watching it as
I was about six feet away.
See from the door,
the lights were on,
there was a kind of a filmy
curtain over the door.
You could see shadows moving
around on the side.  If you
knew what was happening--
you could interpret
the movements of all
these shadowy figures
behind this curtain--
silhouettes is what
they were.
You could see
people getting down on her,
other people holding her legs,
and really...
surrealistically
horrifying.
Brinkley:
THE TAPE RECORDER
FOR HUNTER WAS ESSENTIAL.
HE ALWAYS BROUGHT
A TAPE RECORDER--
LIKE THOSE FAMOUS-- NOW--
TAPES OF THE HELL'S
ANGELS PARTY.
( Hunter speaking )
Brinkley: THOSE TAPES BECAME
A BIG PART OF THE BOOK
"HELL'S ANGELS,"
BUT HE ALSO LOANED
THOSE TAPES TO TOM WOLFE.
WOLFE USED THOSE TAPES
AND EXTRACTED THINGS
FROM THEM FOR "THE ELECTRIC
KOOL-AID ACID TEST."
Wolfe:
I HAD A HARD TIME
WITH THE TAPE
ABOUT THE RAPE SCENE
AT THE HELL'S ANGELS PARTY.
IT WAS DYNAMITE,
FROM A REPORTING
POINT OF VIEW,
BUT THE THING WAS,
I KNEW WHO THE KEY FIGURES
IN THAT WERE.
ONE WAS THE EX-WIFE...
OF NEAL CASSADY.
AND SHE
QUITE WILLINGLY...
INVITED THE--
THE ENTIRE CORPS
OF HELL'S ANGELS
TO HAVE A GO AT HER.
Wright: IT WASN'T
THE KESEY PEOPLE WHO WERE
DOING THE GANGBANG.
THEY WERE ABOUT LOVE
AND HAPPINESS...
AND TOGETHERNESS
AND COMMUNITY...
AND LOVE AND LIGHT.
THEY WERE, THE ANGELS WEREN'T.
Depp:
"IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME
THAT MY LONG-STANDING
RAPPORT WITH THE ANGELS
BEGAN TO DETERIORATE.
FOR NEARLY A YEAR
I HAD LIVED IN A WORLD
THAT SEEMED, AT FIRST,
LIKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL.
IT WAS OBVIOUS
FROM THE BEGINNING
THAT THE MENACE
BORE LITTLE RESEMBLANCE
TO ITS PUBLICIZED IMAGE.
LATER, AS THEY ATTRACTED
MORE AND MORE ATTENTION,
THE MYSTIQUE
WAS STRETCHED SO THIN
THAT IT FINALLY
BECAME TRANSPARENT.
THE HONEYMOON
CAME TO A JANGLED END
ON OCTOBER 16th,
WHEN THE HELL'S ANGELS
ATTACKED A GET OUT OF
VIETNAM DEMONSTRATION
AT THE OAKLAND-BERKELEY
BORDER."
Man on TV:
The bike rider is
Clifford Workman,
treasurer
of the Hell's Angels.
He's here to challenge
his biographer,
a tense young
literary journalist
named Hunter Thompson.
What did you think
of the book?
Well, I'll tell you, Al
- and Hunter,
everybody in this room,
- ( audience laughs )
that that book
is 60% cheap trash.
This is what happened:
Junkie George was beating
his own lady.
- Al: Junkie George?
- ( audience laughs,
applause )
Clifford:
Junkie George's dog
bit him, right?
- Hunter: I didn't see--
- To me, this is a personal
affair.
If a guy wants to beat
his wife and his dog
bites him,
that's between
the three of them.
But there was somebody
about 30' to my left
beating his wife
to a pulp on the rocks.
If he had been beating her
that bad, somebody would
have stopped him.
Oh, no.Don't-- don't--
you're kidding me
and you're gonna
kid everybody else.
Nobody stopped him.
You know he beat his wife up.
You just said it, right?
You walked right up
to him and you said,
"Only a punk beats
his wife and dog."
- You finish it--
- And he said, "Hunter,
you want some of this?"
And you said, "No."
But you got it anyways.
And when he hit you,
three or four others
hit you too.
We let them beat him up
for a minute,
then we broke it up
and told him to get
out of there.
He left
and got in his car.
Well, uh--
he says that he went
to the police station
all bloodied-up
and they threw him out,
which is malarkey.
I mean, but it's part
of his style of writing.
Depp:
"MY FACE LOOKED LIKE
IT HAD BEEN JAMMED
INTO THE SPOKES
OF A SPEEDING HARLEY,
AND THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME AWAKE
WAS THE SPASTIC PAIN
OF A BROKEN RIB.
IT HAD BEEN
A BAD TRIP--
FAST AND WILD
IN SOME MOMENTS,
SLOW AND DIRTY IN OTHERS,
BUT ON BALANCE
IT LOOKED LIKE A BUMMER.
ON MY WAY BACK
TO SAN FRANCISCO,
I TRIED TO COMPOSE
A FITTING EPITAPH.
I WANTED
SOMETHING ORIGINAL,
BUT THERE WAS NO ESCAPING
THE ECHO OF MISTAH KURTZ'S
FINAL WORDS
FROM THE 'HEART
OF DARKNESS':
'THE HORROR!
THE HORROR!
EXTERMINATE
ALL THE BRUTES!'"
Brinkley:
ALTHOUGH "HELL'S ANGELS"
ROCKETED HIM
TO NAME RECOGNITION
AND SUCCESS,
HE DIDN'T SEE IT HIMSELF
AS BEING THE SUCCESSFUL BOOK
THAT HE WANTED.
IT DIDN'T SELL ENOUGH
FOR HIM,
EVEN THOUGH IT MADE
THE BEST-SELLER LIST.
HE DIDN'T MAKE ENOUGH
MONEY OFF OF IT.HE FELT
RIPPED OFF BY THE PUBLISHER.
HE GOT FRUSTRATED
WITH THAT.
HE HAD THOUGHT THAT IT
WOULD BE THE HOME RUN,
BUT WHAT IT DID DO,
THAT BOOK MADE HIM REALIZE
THAT THERE WAS A MARKET
IN THE FREAK CIRCUS
OF THE '60s.
( "It's No Secret"
playing )
Brinkley:
AND IT BECAME THIS THING
GOING ON OUT IN THE BAY AREA
AND HUNTER WAS
DEEPLY PART OF IT.
HE USED TO DRIVE
HIS BSA LIGHTNING MOTORBIKE
AND GO TO
THE MATRIX AND BEFRIENDED
JEFFERSON AIRPLANE.
HE HAD A HUGE CRUSH
ON GRACE SLICK.
* OH!
* IS IT ANY WONDER
WHY I FEEL LIKE *
* MY WHOLE
LIFE IS THROUGH? *
* YEAH!
* WHEN I STOP FEELING
HOW STRONG MY LOVE
IS FOR YOU... *
Jann Wenner:
THE SAN FRANCISCO
BAY AREA WAS A HOTBED
OF LIVE
ROCK 'N' ROLL STUFF,
DRUG CULTURE,
PSYCHEDELICS, KESEY,
POLITICS,
CAMPUS ACTIVISM.
IT WAS MORE ON THE EDGE
CULTURALLY
THAN ANY OTHER
PLACE IN THE COUNTRY.
THERE'S MORE FREEDOM THERE.
"ROLLING STONE"
BEGAN AND MERGED
ALL THOSE ELEMENTS.
AND WE JUST THOUGHT
THERE WAS A TIME FOR
A NEW KIND OF POLITICS
AND IT WOULD EMERGE
OUT OF THE ROCK 'N' ROLL
CONSCIOUSNESS
AND THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL
ETHOS AND THAT IDEA.
* TODAY I FEEL LIKE
PLEASING YOU *
* MORE THAN BEFORE...
Wright:
THE ENERGY WAS
JUST PHENOMENAL.
IT WAS LIKE
LOSING YOUR IDENTITY
AND BEING
JUST KIND OF SUCKED...
INTO WHATEVER,
YOU KNOW?
WHATEVER--
WHATEVER THIS WAS,
IT WAS SOME KIND OF
MAGICAL SOMETHING OR OTHER.
* ...ALL I WANT TO DO
* TO BE LOVING YOU
* IT'LL ALL BE THERE WHEN
MY DREAMS COME TRUE... *
Tim Crouse:
HUNTER WAS A ROMANTIC.
HUNTER'S UTOPIA,
WHICH HE HAD EXPERIENCED
BEFORE I MET HIM,
WAS SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE EARLY '60s.
BUT THERE WAS ALWAYS
TWO GREAT MORAL PRESSURES--
THE WAR
AND CIVIL RIGHTS.
- ( clamoring )
- * TODAY YOU'LL
MAKE ME SAY... *
Buchanan:
THERE'S BITTERNESS AND
NASTINESS TO POLITICS TODAY,
BUT I DON'T SENSE
THE SAME ANGER AND RAGE
THAT WE HAD
IN THE 1960s--
ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATIONS,
RIOTS,
DISORDERS OF RACIAL CONFLICT,
THE GENERATIONAL CONFLICT.
AND HUNTER WAS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT.
* ...ANY MORE
THAN ALL I AM *
* WOULD BE A LIE...
Brinkley:
THE LAST PERIOD
WHERE THERE WAS AN OPTIMISM
IN HUNTER ABOUT AMERICA
WERE THE KENNEDYS,
WITH JOHN KENNEDY
AND BOBBY KENNEDY.
HUNTER LIKED THAT THEY
HAD SUCH HUBRIS.
THEY COULD BE GOOD POLITICIANS
BUT PLAY HARD AT MIDNIGHT.
THAT MEANT A LOT.
THOSE WERE HIS GUYS.
I WANT
THE POLITICS OF HOPE,
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER
IN THIS COUNTRY.
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT WE CAN SAY
THAT WE ARE JOYOUS
OR THAT WE ARE HAPPY
IF 590 AMERICANS ARE KILLED
IN VIETNAM LAST WEEK
AND IF WE HAVE RIOTING
IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL.
I THINK THAT
WE CAN DO BETTER.
* ...ALL FOR YOU.
( gunshot )
( people screaming )
Depp:
"THE DAY AFTER
ROBERT KENNEDY DIED
I RECEIVED A NOTICE
FROM THE LOCAL RAILWAY
EXPRESS OFFICE
SAYING MY WALTHER P-38
AUTOMATIC PISTOL
HAD ARRIVED.
WE SHOT IT ONE AFTERNOON,
AGREEING THAT IT HAD A VERY
SMOOTH ACTION...
AND THEN I SENT IT BACK.
RETURNING THE P-38
SOLVED NOTHING.
IT ONLY POSTPONED
THE NECESSITY
OF COMING TO GRIPS
WITH MY GUN PROBLEM."
- ( gunshots )
- * HEY, JOE...
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *
Brinkley: HUNTER SAW GUNS
AS ONE OF THE GREAT
THINGS IN LIFE.
HE LOVED SHOOTING THEM
AND FIRING THEM WHENEVER
HE COULD.
* WHERE YOU GOIN'
WITH THAT GUN IN YOUR HAND? *
WHEN HE'S AT BIG SUR,
HE WOULD GO
WILD-BOAR,
WILD-PIG HUNTING
WITH A SUBMACHINE GUN.
( gunshots )
Juan Thompson:
I HAD A BB GUN WHEN I WAS
LIKE SEVEN, PROBABLY.
THOSE ARE SOME
OF MY BEST MEMORIES
FROM THAT TIME,
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING
WE BOTH ENJOYED DOING,
BUT IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE
IT WAS TIME
WE WERE BUILDING
OUR RELATIONSHIP
AS A FATHER AND SON,
AND NOT JUST AS KIND
OF ROOMMATES.
Wenner:
THE GUNS-- THEY WEREN'T
JUST FOR AMUSEMENT.
HE LIKED THE NOISE,
THE VIOLENCE AND THE
DESTRUCTION OF IT.
AND HE HAD THAT
IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE TOO.
WE HAD
A REAL VIOLENT STREAK.
Wright:
THE FIRST TIME
HE TOOK ACID, HUNTER SAYS,
"SONDI, GET ME THE GUN."
I SAID, "I CAN'T
GET YOU THE GUN.
I'M TERRIFIED
SOMETHING IS GONNA
HAPPEN TO JUAN."
AND-- AND HUNTER SAYS,
"YOU GET ME THAT GUN
OR I'M THROWING THIS BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW."
HE THROWS THE BOOT
THROUGH THE WINDOW.
( mimics glass shattering )
Depp: "HAD MY BRAIN
TURNED INTO JELLY FROM
TOO MUCH ACID?
WHAT WAS I DOING
WITH ALL THESE GUNS?
MY ANGST BEGAN
TO FESTER
AS THE GUN-CONTROL ARGUMENT
RAGED CLOSER TO HOME.
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE
BEGAN TELLING EACH OTHER
THAT THE GUN
WAS THE ULTIMATE CURE
FOR WHAT AILS US...
THE AMERICAN WAY."
Brinkley:
BY 1968, HUNTER
TAKES ON THIS IDEA
THAT HE'S GONNA
BE ABLE TO WRITE ON THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
AND HUNTER THOUGHT
THAT COVERING POLITICS--
'68 WAS GONNA
BE THE BOOK.
( rock music playing )
Depp:
"I WENT TO CHICAGO
AS A JOURNALIST.
MY CANDIDATE HAD BEEN
MURDERED IN LOS ANGELES
TWO MONTHS EARLIER."
* COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON *
* COME ON
* DIDN'T I MAKE
YOU FEEL... *
Crouse:
HUNTER WAS IN CHICAGO RIGHT
IN THE MIDST OF THE GAS
AND THE BEATINGS
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
AND I THINK THAT
THAT WAS A MILESTONE EVENT
FOR HUNTER
THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER.
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE HUMPHREY
WHO WAS THE CANDIDATE,
AND HE NEVER
FORGAVE MUSKIE WHO WAS THE
VICE-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE
FOR SUPPORTING MAYOR DALEY
AND HIS CHICAGO POLICE.
* TAKE IT,
TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE
OF MY HEART NOW, BABY... *
Depp:
"I WITNESSED AT LEAST
10 BEATINGS IN CHICAGO
THAT WERE WORSE
THAN ANYTHING I EVER
SAW THE HELL'S ANGELS DO.
I LEFT IN A STATE
OF HYSTERICAL ANGST,
CONVINCED
BY WHAT I HAD SEEN
THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS
CLUBBING ITSELF TO DEATH."
* IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL GOOD... *
Wright: THERE WERE ONLY TEARS
TWICE THAT I REMEMBER EVER
IN OUR 19 YEARS TOGETHER.
I REMEMBER ONE,
WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM
THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION.
AND HE WAS TELLING ME
THE STORIES
ABOUT THE PEOPLE
BEING BEATEN
AND HE-- YOU KNOW,
THE TEARS JUST--
AND THAT WAS
VERY-- YOU KNOW.
IT WAS--
HUNTER WAS A MAN
THAT DIDN'T CRY.
* AND BABY, DEEP DOWN
IN YOUR HEART... *
Wright:
AND HE CARED SO MUCH.
HUNTER WAS A PATRIOT.
HE KNEW THE CONSTITUTION,
HE CARED ABOUT IT,
AND THEN THERE HE WAS
IN CHICAGO AND IT'S ALL
BEING DESTROYED.
( Janis Joplin shrieks )
* TAKE IT, TAKE
ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE... *
Wright:
I THINK CHICAGO
INSPIRED HIM TO DO--
TO DO MORE,
TO GET MORE INVOLVED.
* TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE
PIECE OF MY HEART *
- * NOW, DARLING,
YEAH YEAH YEAH *
- * OH, HAVE A...
Wenner:
RIGHT AWAY, RIOTS STARTED--
CHICAGO, '68 TOOK PLACE.
THEN THAT WAS
KIND OF A RADICALIZING,
GALVANIZING EVENT.
WE WERE ALREADY ESCHEWING
MAINSTREAM NOSTALGIA
IN POLITICS
SAYING, "LOOK,
THE SYSTEM IS TOO RIGGED.
POLITICS IS...
FINE, BUT IN
SOME OTHER VENUE."
I GOT A LETTER FROM HUNTER
OUT OF THE BLUE,
COMPLIMENTING ME
ON "ROLLING STONE,"
HOW MUCH HE LIKED IT.
SO I WROTE HIM BACK
AND SAID, "WHAT ARE
YOU DOING THESE DAYS?
I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU
IN THE MAGAZINE."
THEN HE MENTIONED
HE WAS RUNNING FOR SHERIFF.
SO I SAID,
"HOW ABOUT THAT?
SOUNDS GREAT."
IT'S THE KIND OF THING
WE WOULD RUN TODAY,
YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY
RUNNING FOR SHERIFF IN ASPEN,
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE TOWN.
James Salter:
Hunter Thompson is a moralist
posing as an immoralist.
Nixon is an immoralist
disguised as a moralist.
This is James Salter.
There'll be thieves
and auto wrecks in Aspen
whoever gets elected,
but Hunter represents
something wholly alien
to the other candidates
for sheriff--
ideas,
and the sympathy
towards the young, generous,
grass-oriented society,
which is making
the only serious effort
to face the technological
nightmare we have created.
The only thing
against him is
he is a visionary
who wants to cure
the world.
George Stranahan:
FIRST OF ALL, HE DROVE
EVERYBODY BATSHIT NUTS.
HUNTER WAS MY FRIEND
AND NEIGHBOR,
THE MAN WHO
NEVER PAID HIS RENT,
BROKE UP MY MARRIAGE
AND TAUGHT MY CHILDREN
TO SMOKE DOPE.
NOW HUNTER
WAS OUTRAGEOUS,
BUT THERE WAS
SUCH A SORT OF MOVEMENT
THAT THIS GUY
MAY BE CRAZY,
BUT BETTER THAT
THAN WHITMIRE.
( bell tolling )
Announcer:
The American sheriff's job was
carved out of the rugged West.
It was a desperately-
needed position
of few words, much action,
and little praise or glory.
Today the sheriff has
reams of responsibility.
But still-- as in the past--
the number-one responsibility
is to protect his people
and enforce their laws.
Vote for and elect
Carrol Whitmire
for our sheriff.
I THINK A LOT OF PLACES
ARE BEYOND THIS KIND
OF POLITICS.
WE SEEMED TO BE RUNNING
AN EXPERIMENT THAT PEOPLE
WERE WATCHING.
Stranahan:
HUNTER CAME TO ASPEN,
HE HAD MOVED INTO OUR FARM.
HUNTER LIKED
TO TALK POLITICS.
I WAS JUST AT THAT AGE
OF WAR PROTEST-- 1968.
I WAS BECOMING
POLITICAL...
AND SO HUNTER AND I
HAD A LOT IN COMMON
TO TALK ABOUT.
Bob Braudis:
ASPEN THEN WAS A MAGNET
FOR INTELLECTUALS
WHO WANTED TO DROP OUT.
AND HUNTER CONVINCED US
THAT WE DIDN'T
HAVE MUCH EFFECT
ON WHAT HAPPENED
IN WASHINGTON
DAY TO DAY
AND WHAT HAPPENED
IN WASHINGTON FROM DAY TO DAY
DIDN'T HAVE MUCH EFFECT ON US.
BUT WHAT HAPPENED
IN PITKIN COUNTY
HAD A VISCERAL,
DAILY, HOURLY
EFFECT ON THE WAY
WE LIVED HERE.
PEOPLE DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT ASPEN
WAS A BATTLEGROUND.
ASPEN WAS MORE
OF A DISNEYLAND.
HUNTER WAS A VISIONARY.
HE UNDERSTOOD MORE
ABOUT LAND USE
AND DEVELOPMENT
THAN ANY OF US DID.
NOBODY AT THE TIME
WAS STANDING UP TO
THE BULLDOZERS.
"TENTATIVE PLATFORM,
THOMPSON FOR SHERIFF,
ASPEN, COLORADO, 1970:
1-- RIP UP ALL CITY STREETS
WITH JACKHAMMERS
AND SOD THE STREETS
AT ONCE.
2-- CHANGE THE NAME 'ASPEN'
TO 'FAT CITY.'
THIS WOULD PREVENT
GREEDHEADS, LAND-RAPERS
AND OTHER HUMAN JACKALS
FROM CAPITALIZING ON
THE NAME 'ASPEN.'
THESE SWINES SHOULD BE
FUCKED, BROKEN,
AND DRIVEN
ACROSS THE LAND.
3-- IT WILL BE
THE GENERAL PHILOSOPHY
OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE
THAT NO DRUG WORTH TAKING
SHOULD BE SOLD
FOR MONEY.
MY FIRST ACT AS SHERIFF
WILL BE TO INSTALL
ON THE COURTHOUSE LAWN
A SET OF STOCKS
IN ORDER TO PUNISH
DISHONEST DOPE DEALERS
IN A PROPER
PUBLIC FASHION."
( "Walk on the Wild Side"
playing )
Juan:
I WAS ONLY ABOUT SIX
AT THE TIME,
BUT LEGEND HAS IT
THAT MY FATHER SHAVED
HIS HEAD
SO HE COULD SAY,
"UNLIKE MY LONG-HAIRED
OPPONENT, SHERIFF WHITMIRE."
I JUST WISH I COULD
HAVE BEEN OLD ENOUGH
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND
PEOPLE'S REACTION
ABOUT THIS CRAZY,
BALD, FREAK DRUG-FIEND
WHO WAS ABOUT
TO TAKE OVER THE WHOLE
POLITICAL MECHANISM.
* HOLLY CAME
FROM MIAMI, F.L.A... *
HUNTER THOMPSON
IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE
WHO HAS THE IMAGINATION
AND INTELLIGENCE TO BE
A LAW-ENFORCEMENT EXECUTIVE.
ELECT HUNTER THOMPSON
SHERIFF.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
LISTENING!
WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY
LISTEN TO ME ANYMORE?!
( screams )
THIS IS FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!
* HEY, HONEY, TAKE
A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE... *
( woman laughs,
applauds )
Braudis: AT THE START,
I THINK IT WAS MORE TO GET
A MESSAGE OUT
KNOWING THAT DEFEAT
WAS CERTAIN.
THE SERIOUS COMPONENT
OF HUNTER'S CAMPAIGN
SNOWBALLED
AND, AS THE MOVEMENT
GAINED MOMENTUM,
I THINK HUNTER
ACTUALLY BELIEVED
THAT HE HAD A CHANCE.
AND A LOT OF US THAT
WERE SUPPORTING HUNTER
SHARED THAT BELIEF.
WE'RE TRYING
TO GET TOGETHER A LIST
OF ENDORSEMENTS
FOR HUNTER THOMPSON
FOR SHERIFF.
Braudis:
WE WERE ALL FREAKS--
THE PEOPLE
WHO CAME TOGETHER
IN SUPPORT OF HUNTER--
BUT I THINK OUR BIGGEST
ISSUE AT THE TIME WAS
THE ENVIRONMENT,
AND A SECONDARY ISSUE
WAS THE ILLEGAL STATUS
OF DRUGS.
WHAT IS THAT
YOU'RE SMOKING?
THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE
TO BE MARIJUANA.
( all laugh )
- YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T TELL?
- ( laughs )
AN AWFUL LOT OF US
WERE SMOKING DOPE
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT SAID,
"THOU SHALT NOT."
WE SAID, "WE SHALL."
MARIJUANA LAWS ARE
ONE OF THE REASONS
THAT HAS ENGENDERED
THIS LACK OF RESPECT
THAT COPS COMPLAIN ABOUT
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
WHEN YOU GET A WHOLE
GENERATION THAT GROWS UP
AS FELONS, THEY KNOW
THE LAW IS RIDICULOUS
AND THEY'RE TOLD US
ALL THIS GIBBERISH ABOUT IT--
"IT DRIVES YOU CRAZY
AND MAKES YOUR BRAIN SOFT,
AND YOUR FEET FALL OFF."
( all laughing )
EVEN THE POLICE KNOW
IT'S A SILLY LAW.
IT'S TIME THAT
WE EITHER BRIDGE
THAT CHASM
WITH SOME KIND OF REALISTIC
LAW ENFORCEMENT OR ELSE--
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA
BE BRIDGED IN THIS COUNTRY.
WE'RE GOING TO REVOLUTION.
Wright:
I THINK THAT WAS
ONE OF HUNTER'S
GREATEST TIMES,
MYSELF.
HE HAD THE PASSION
TO MOVE PEOPLE,
CHANGE PEOPLE'S THINKING,
MAKE THEM ACT
AND BRING THEM OUT--
NOT JUST DEFY AUTHORITY
AND TAKE AS MANY DRUGS
AS YOU WANT,
BUT TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE
TRYING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM,
MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK
AND MAKE
THE SYSTEM GOOD.
HE HAD THAT IN HIM.
Whitmire:
IF HE WAS ELECTED SHERIFF,
I CAN FORESEE
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE
AN INFLUX OF WHAT WE
CALL THE HIPPIES.
AND I THINK
IF THIS HAPPENED,
IT WOULD ACTUALLY
DESTROY ASPEN.
Man:
WHEN YOU PUBLICLY COME OUT
WITH STATEMENTS
OF MESCALINE,
MARIJUANA--
MY GOOD GOD!
THIS ISN'T THE WAY
OF AMERICAN LIFE.
* YOU WALK
INTO THE ROOM *
* WITH YOUR PENCIL
IN YOUR HAND *
* YOU SEE
SOMEBODY NAKED *
* AND YOU SAY,
"WHO IS THAT, MAN?" *
THEY ARE RAPING
OUR FORESTS.SOME OF THEM
ARE LIVING LIKE ANIMALS.
* BECAUSE SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE *
* BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS *
* DO YOU,
MR. JONES? *
HUNTER THOMPSON...
HAS NO GRIP ON REALITY.
I THINK HE'S PSYCHOTIC.
I THINK IF THERE WAS EVER
GONNA BE ANY EXCESSES
WITHIN THE SHERIFF'S
DEPARTMENT,
I'D LOOK FOR MORE
OUT OF HUNTER THOMPSON
THAN CARROL WHITMIRE.
* AND YOU GO WATCH
THE GEEK... *
Braudis:
HE WAS A REDNECK
AND VERY POPULAR
WITH THE PEOPLE WHO
CONTROLLED THIS VALLEY THEN.
THEY DIDN'T WANT
A SMART SHERIFF.
THEY WANTED PEOPLE
WHO WOULD DO THEIR BIDDING.
* BE SUCH A FREAK...
I'M NOT AT ALL
EMBARRASSED AT THE USE
OF THE WORD "FREAK."
I THINK THE WAY
THINGS ARE GOING,
IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY
IT'S A VERY
HONORABLE DESIGNATION.
I'M PROUD OF IT.
* AND SOMETHING
IS HAPPENING HERE... *
Hunter:
WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE,
AN ISOLATED TOWN,
WITH A VERY UNUSUAL
KIND OF POPULATION.
WE DO HAVE
A FREAK POWER BASE.
IT'S UNDENIABLE.
WE HAVE
ABOUT 1,000 VOTES
THAT WOULDN'T--
IF I WENT OUT THERE AND WALKED
THROUGH THE STREETS NAKED
WITH A BOMB IN EACH HAND,
( laughs )
THEY WOULD STILL VOTE FOR ME.
Braudis:
ONE OF HUNTER'S
"FREAK POWER" TOOLS
WAS TO REGISTER PEOPLE
WHO HAD NEVER VOTED BEFORE.
- OKAY, WHERE'S
THIS VOTING PLACE?
- ( laughs )
- HUNTER, 182;
WHITMIRE, 137.
- ( phone rings )
- RICKS, 10.
- YEAH!RIGHT!
( all cheering )
Woman:
ONE COULD DO IT,
ONE COULD DO IT.
THE SUBURBS--
THE SILENT MAJORITY.
- OKAY, HERE'S THE TOTALS.
- Man: HE'S NOT AVAILABLE
RIGHT AT THIS SECOND.
WHITMIRE, 204;
- HUNTER, 173.
- ( murmuring )
OKAY, UH...
UNFORTUNATELY,
IT PROVED WHAT
I SET OUT TO PROVE--
AND IT WAS MORE
A POLITICAL POINT
THAN A LOCAL ELECTION--
- THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM
REALLY IS --.
- ( bleeps )
VERY HARD TO HAVE
A BALDHEADED LUNATIC--
I'LL DO THAT
FOR THE CAMERAS.
HEY, YOU FELLOWS.
Man:
ALL RIGHT!
AND WE MADE A MISTAKE
IN THINKING...
THAT THE TOWN WAS
READY FOR AN HONEST
POLITICAL CAMPAIGN.
Depp:
"WE FRIGHTEN
THE BASTARDS SO BADLY
THAT ON ELECTION DAY
THEY ROLLED PEOPLE
IN WHEELCHAIRS--
EVEN ON STRETCHERS--
INTO THE POLLING PLACES
TO VOTE AGAINST US.
AND WHEN I LOST,
THEY INSTANTLY GOT
DOWN TO MAKING SURE
THAT NOBODY
LIKE ME COULD EVER
RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN."
WE RAN THAT STORY,
HAD THE INFAMOUS POSTER
OF A TWO-THUMBED HAND
HOLDING A PEYOTE BUTTON.
HE CAME IN
AND TALKED TO AN EDITOR
NAMED JOHN LOMBARDI.
AFTERWARDS, LOMBARDI,
WHO WAS FROM PHILADELPHIA
AND WAS NOT QUITE USED
TO THE WEST COAST CRAZY--
HE SAID, "YOU KNOW,
THAT HUNTER THOMPSON
IS WEIRD.
HE'S REALLY WEIRD.
HE CAME IN WITH A BOX
FULL OF WIGS AND HATS.
HE WAS TAKING THEM OFF
AND PUTTING THEM ON
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE CONVERSATION."
( "Sympathy for the Devil"
playing )
* PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE MYSELF *
* I'M A MAN OF WEALTH
AND TASTE... *
Wenner:
RALPH IS CRAZIER
THAN HUNTER EVER WAS.
WHEREAS HUNTER COULD ALWAYS
PULL BACK FROM THE EDGE,
RALPH WAS
A TRUE BELIEVER.
AND IF IT WAS TIME
TO TAKE
THE FUCKING THING DOWN,
RALPH WAS PREPARED
TO GO IN LIKE GUY FAWKES
AND BLOW UP PARLIAMENT.
AND SO WE HAD
THIS PURITY OF VISION,
AND HUNTER SAW THAT.
I KNOW YOU
FROM SOMEWHERE.
I WONDER WHERE.
* PLEASED
TO MEET YOU... *
HAVE I SEEN YOU
SOMEWHERE BEFORE?
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?
ARE YOU LISTENING?
PLEASE!
Stewardess: On behalf
of Rocky Mountain Airways
and your flight crew,
we'd like to thank you
for flying with us today.
Have a pleasant stay
in Aspen
or wherever your final
destination might be.
Steadman:
I THINK WHAT
HE SAW IN THIS CONNECTION
WAS SOMEBODY THAT SOMEHOW
SAW THE THING IN PICTURES
AS HE SAW IT IN WORDS.
AND THAT SEEMED TO ME
TO BE PART
OF THE WHOLE CHEMISTRY,
OF OUR CHEMISTRY,
THAT MADE GONZO
POSSIBLE.
HERE I GO.
Perry:
I'VE SEEN THE ILLUSTRATIONS
STEADMAN WAS DOING
BEFORE HE WORKED
WITH HUNTER.
HE WAS MUCH MORE
CONVENTIONAL BEFORE HUNTER
GOT AHOLD OF HIM.
HUNTER TOLD ME
HE LIKED STEADMAN'S STUFF,
SO HE ASKED HIM
TO HELP HIM COVER
THE KENTUCKY DERBY
FOR A MAGAZINE
CALLED "SCANLAN'S."
AND RALPH TOLD ME
AS SOON AS HE GOT OFF
THE AIRPLANE,
HUNTER GAVE HIM
SOME PSILOCYBIN
AND HIS LIFE CHANGED.
- COME ON, BUDDY.
- COME ON, HEY!
HUNTER!
* WHEN AFTER ALL
IT WAS YOU AND ME... *
SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
Wright: RALPH--
WHEN HE FIRST MET HUNTER,
HE'D NEVER DONE
ANY DRUGS.
HE DRANK, BUT HE'D NEVER
DONE ANYTHING HALLUCINOGENIC.
AND SO HERE COMES HUNTER,
HE GIVES HIM MESCALINE
AND HE LOSES IT.
YOU KNOW,
RALPH LOSES IT.
Steadman:
I WAS A CHOIRBOY--
YOU KNOW, DECENT,
INNOCENT ABROAD.
YOU KNOW HOW THINGS ARE.
AND SO I GUESS
IT WAS ATTRACTIVE,
THAT KIND OF RACINESS.
* OH, YEAH
* GET DOWN, BABY...
Steadman:
I THINK THE BIRTH
OF GONZO HAPPENED
WHEN THE EVIL CAME OUT
OF ME IN THE DRAWINGS.
Depp:
"UNLIKE MOST OF THE OTHERS
IN THE PRESS BOX,
WE DIDN'T GIVE
A HOOT IN HELL WHAT WAS
HAPPENING ON THE TRACK.
WE HAD COME TO WATCH
THE REAL BEASTS PERFORM.
WHEN THE CROWD STOOD
TO FACE THE FLAG
AND SING
'MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME,'
STEADMAN FACED THE CROWD
AND SKETCHED FRANTICALLY.
THOUSANDS OF RAVING,
STUMBLING DRUNKS
GETTING ANGRIER
AND ANGRIER AS THEY LOSE
MORE AND MORE MONEY."
Wolfe:
IN THAT STORY, YOU GET
ALL OF THE ATTITUDES
TO THE DERBY,
AND YOU NEVER
GET TO THE DERBY.
YOU'RE THERE TO--
HE SAID TO COME TO THE DERBY,
AND YOU GET ALL
THE DRUNK SOUTHERNERS,
YOU GET ALL
THE WEIRD SOCIALITES,
THE WEIRD BOOKIES,
THE HANGERS-ON.
Depp:
"IT WAS A FACE
I'D SEEN A THOUSAND TIMES
AT EVERY DERBY
I'D BEEN TO.
I SAW IT
IN MY HEAD AS THE MASK
OF THE WHISKEY GENTRY--
THE INEVITABLE RESULT
OF TOO MUCH INBREEDING."
Hunter:
FIRST, I'D REALIZED I WAS
DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
A FRIEND OF MINE,
HE WROTE ME A NOTE SAYING
"THAT DERBY PIECE
WAS PURE GONZO."
AND I THOUGHT, "WELL,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS..."
I THOUGHT
IT WAS A BRUTAL FAILURE.
I'D BOTCHED MY ASSIGNMENT,
YOU KNOW?
IT WAS ONE
OF MY WORST FAILURES
AND I GOT THIS ONSLAUGHT
OF MAIL-- MAIL, CALLS--
SAYING I MADE
A GREAT BREAKTHROUGH
IN JOURNALISM.
WELL, CHRIST,
IF I MADE IT--
AS A BREAKTHROUGH,
WE'VE GOTTA CALL IT
SOMETHING.
SO I LIKED THE WORD "GONZO,"
AND IT SEEMED TO ME
WHAT I WAS DOING--
KIND OF NICE AND CRAZY,
LIKE ZEN. GONZO.
* HOPE YOU GUESS
MY NAME... *
- I'M EDWARD.
- Steadman: HE HAS
A BIRD CALLED EDWARD.
HE'S SUCH
A MARVELOUS CHARACTER.
I THINK HUNTER
TORMENTED IT, BUT IT WAS
KIND OF A TWO-WAY AFFECTION.
HUNTER WOULD USE IT,
I THINK, TO BOUNCE OFF,
TO BRING
INTO THE STORY
HOW HE WAS
FEELING ABOUT IT,
WHO WAS THE BIRD.
I SUPPOSE THAT
AT SOME POINT I, IN A WAY,
BECAME THE BIRD.
SPEAK UP, EDWARD.
SPEAK UP! SPEAK UP!
TALK TO ME!
HE BANGED THE CAGE--
BANG BANG BANG BANG!
"EDWARD.
IT'S ME, EDWARD.
I'M COMING
TO GET YOU, EDWARD."
HE'D OPEN THE CAGE,
AND HE'D SAY, "EDWARD,
THERE IS NO BIRD GOD
THAT'S GONNA HELP YOU
NOW, EDWARD."
AND THIS BIRD'S GOING...
( mimics bird )
( squawking )
Steadman:
I FEEL LIKE EDWARD
SOMETIMES...
NOW, WE'RE GOING
TO TALK, EDWARD.
Steadman:
...HOLDING ME LIKE A BIRD,
AND I'M TRYING TO BITE
MY WAY OUT OF IT.
I NEVER FELT FEAR
WHEN HE WAS
AT THE WHEEL.
THERE'S NO HOLES
OVER HERE.
- OOH!
- THIS IS A BIG BOX.
NO WONDER WHY I DON'T BUY
AMERICAN CARS. GOD DAMN IT.
MOVE OVER,
I'M GONNA KILL SOMEBODY!
YOU'RE TOO SMALL!
- I WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY
A LOT BIGGER THAN YOU!
- ( tires screeching )
- WHAT'S THE SPEED LIMIT?
- 70. OH MY GOD, IT'S 75.
HOLY SHIT.
NO WONDER HE'S GOING--
Duke's voice:
WE WERE SOMEWHERE
AROUND BARSTOW,
ON THE EDGE OF THE DESERT,
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD.
SUDDENLY, THERE WAS
A TERRIBLE ROAR
ALL AROUND US
AND THE SKY WAS
FULL OF WHAT LOOKED
LIKE HUGE BATS,
ALL SWOOPING
AND SCREECHING AND
DIVING AROUND THE CAR.
AND A VOICE WAS SCREAMING,
"HOLY JESUS, WHAT ARE THESE
GODDAMN ANIMALS?!"
( yelling softly )
( screeches )
DID YOU SAY
SOMETHING?HUH?
NEVER MIND.
- IT'S YOUR TURN TO DRIVE.
- * EVERYBODY'S DANCING... *
Duke's voice:
"NO POINT IN MENTIONING
THESE BATS," I THOUGHT.
"THE POOR BASTARD
WILL SEE THEM SOON ENOUGH."
Wenner: "FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS"-- IT STARTS
OFF LIKE A ROCKET.
"WE WERE SOMEWHERE
ON THE EDGE OF BARSTOW
WHEN THE DRUGS BEGAN
TO TAKE HOLD."
WELL, THAT JUST GRABS YOU--
DAMN-- RIGHT THERE,
THE DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUNK
WHAT WAS IN THE TRUNK--
ALL THE DRUGS,
THE SALT SHAKERS
FULL OF MESCALINE, COCAINE--
ON AND ON AND ON.
IT WAS MAD GENIUS STUFF.
Duke's voice:
WE HAD TWO BAGS OF GRASS,
75 PELLETS OF MESCALINE,
FIVE SHEETS OF HIGH-POWERED
BLOTTER ACID,
- A SALT SHAKER
HALF-FULL OF COCAINE...
- ( bat screeching )
...A PINT OF RAW ETHER,
AND TWO DOZEN AMYLS.
NOT THAT WE NEEDED
ALL THAT FOR THE TRIP,
BUT ONCE YOU GET
LOCKED INTO A SERIOUS
DRUG COLLECTION,
THE TENDENCY IS TO PUSH IT
AS FAR AS YOU CAN.
* DON'T MATTER
WHERE YOU COME FROM... *
Radio host:
A House subcommittee report
says illegal drugs
killed 160 American
GIs last year,
40 of them
in Vietnam. Drugs--
- * One toke over
the line, sweet Jesus... *
- ONE TOKE, MAN!
* ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE
* SITTIN' DOWNTOWN
IN A RAILWAY STATION *
* ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE... *
Wenner: THROUGH ALL
THIS TIME, HE'S TRAVELING
WITH OSCAR ACOSTA.
THEY WENT THERE AND HAD
THIS DRUG RAMPAGE.
- I FOUND SOME GOOD GRASS
FOR $12 A LID.
- Hunter: GOOD.
- I JUST ORDERED TWO LIDS.
I'LL GET IT TOMORROW.
- GOD BLESS YOU.
Wenner:
HUNTER'S RAOUL DUKE--
THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK--
WE PUBLISHED WHATEVER WAS
PUBLISHED IN "ROLLING STONE."
IT WAS PUBLISHED
AS "BY RAOUL DUKE."
OSCAR TRANSMOGRIFIES
FROM OSCAR ZETA ACOSTA,
CRUSADING CHICANO ATTORNEY,
INTO DR. GONZO.
* I FELT THE JOY
AND I LEARNED ABOUT
THE PAIN *
* THEN MY MAMA SAID...
Laila Nabulsi:
RAOUL DUKE AND DR. GONZO
WERE HUNTER THOMPSON
AND OSCAR ACOSTA.
HE JUST USED THAT
AS A COVER.
YOU HAVE THESE
SORT OF ANTIHEROES.
IT'S "BUTCH CASSIDY
AND THE SUNDANCE KID."
IT'S JUST THE NEXT
VERSION IN A WAY.
THEY'RE OUTLAWS.
THESE GUYS WERE FIGHTING
AND THEY REALLY
WERE IN REAL LIFE.
OSCAR ACOSTA WAS
USING THE LAW
AND THE BROWN POWER MOVEMENT
AND HUNTER WAS
FIGHTING WITH THE PEN
AND USING JOURNALISM.
SO THEY REALLY WERE WARRIORS
OF THEIR GENERATION.
* ...IN A RAILWAY STATION,
ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE *
* ONE TOKE, ONE TOKE
OVER THE LINE. *
Brinkley:
WHEN HUNTER WENT
TO LAS VEGAS,
HE WAS ON AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
TO WRITE ABOUT
THIS MOTORCYCLE RACE.
THEY ONLY WANTED
A VERY BRIEF, ALMOST LIKE
A LITTLE BOX ABOUT THE RACE.
HE DELIVERED
THIS SCREED THAT WENT ON
FOR ABOUT 60 PAGES
DETAILING THE DESERT
AND EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED.
AND IT HAD IN IT
A LITTLE BIT OF THAT
WILD, DRUGGY...
FEEL THAT THE FINAL
"FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS" HAD.
Duke's voice:
IGNORE THIS TERRIBLE DRUG.
PRETEND IT'S NOT HAPPENING.
UH... HI THERE!
( groans )
MY NAME...
UH...
- RAOUL DUKE.
- YOUR SUITE ISN'T
READY YET, BUT...
( hisses, voice distorts )
SOMEONE WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU.
( yells )
NO! WE HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING YET. MOVE!
I CAN HANDLE THIS.
AT THAT POINT
THERE WAS STILL
KIND OF THAT TIMOTHY LEARY
APPROACH TO PSYCHEDELICS
GOING AROUND,
WHERE IT'S THIS
VERY PIOUS THING.
YOU SAT ON A PERSIAN RUG
AND LISTENED TO INDIAN MUSIC.
THERE HAD BEEN
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY
OF ACTUALLY DEALING
WITH THE FACT THAT WHEN
YOU'RE STONED ON PSYCHEDELICS,
YOU'RE OFTEN JUST
WAY OUT OF CONTROL
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU'RE GONNA
HANDLE THINGS.
AND HUNTER MADE THAT
HIS REAL TOPIC.
Depp:
"WHAT LEARY
TOOK DOWN WITH HIM
WAS THE CENTRAL ILLUSION
OF A WHOLE LIFESTYLE
THAT HE HELPED CREATE--
A GENERATION
OF PERMANENT CRIPPLES,
FAILED SEEKERS,
WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD
THE ESSENTIAL
OLD-MYSTIC FALLACY
OF THE ACID CULTURE:
THE DESPERATE
ASSUMPTION THAT SOMEBODY
OR AT LEAST SOME FORCE
IS TENDING THE LIGHT
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL."
Woman: I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M
STARTING TO FEEL THAT DRINK.
- PEANUTS, MAN.
- OH, GOD! OH, GOD.
TWO CUBA LIBRES
WITH BEER AND MESCAL
ON THE SIDE.
Duke's voice:
TERRIBLE THINGS WERE
HAPPENING ALL AROUND US.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO WALK IN THIS MUCK--
NO FOOTING AT ALL.
Perry: AT LAST
THERE WAS A VOCABULARY FOR
TALKING ABOUT PSYCHEDELICS,
AND IT WAS
ALSO AN EARLY CLUE
TO THE NEW DIRECTION--
MORE AND MORE
CRAZINESS FROM HUNTER.
OF COURSE, HE WAS HIGH ANYWAY.
I NEVER SAW
THE GUY WITHOUT
EITHER A CAN OF BUD
OR A BOTTLE
OF WILD TURKEY
IN HIS HAND.
HE DRANK A BOTTLE
OF BOURBON A DAY,
AND THAT WAS ON TOP
OF ALL THE PILLS
HE WAS TAKING,
SO HE WAS JUST
CONSTANTLY PUSHING
THE LIMIT OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
( reptiles roaring )
Duke's voice:
I WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FUCKING REPTILE ZOO
AND SOMEBODY WAS
GIVING BOOZE TO THESE
GODDAMN THINGS.
IT WON'T BE LONG NOW
BEFORE THEY TEAR US
TO SHREDS!
( roars )
( yells )
PLEASE!
TELL ME ABOUT
THE FUCKING GOLF SHOES!
All: HUH?
THE REJECTION
BY "SPORTS ILLUSTRATED"
INFURIATED HIM.
AND IT WAS ONLY
AT THAT POINT THAT
HE STARTED REALIZING,
LIKE, "EUREKA!
CHICAGO MAY NOT BE
WHERE THE DEATH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS.
IT'S LAS VEGAS."
( Hunter vocalizes )
* OOH YES!
( vocalizes )
* OOH YES!
* THESE LONG STRANGE NIGHTS
* THESE LONG
STRANGE NIGHTS... *
Wenner:
HUNTER HAD RENTED A CADILLAC
AND WANTED ME TO PAY FOR IT.
I SAID, "NO," YOU KNOW?
"I'M NOT PAYING FOR THE
RENT OF A CADILLAC."
AND HE WAS LIKE,
"WELL, I CAN'T COVER
THE GODDAMN AMERICAN DREAM
IN A VOLKSWAGEN.
WHAT THE FUCK IS
WRONG WITH YOU?"
AND UM...
YOU KNOW, OF COURSE
THAT'S QUITE TRUE.
( Steadman vocalizes )
* DRIVE YOUR STAKE
* THROUGH
A DARKENED HEART *
* IN A RED
MERCEDES BENZ... *
Depp:
"BREAKDOWN
ON PARADISE BLVD."
"AT THIS POINT
IN THE CHRONOLOGY,
DR. DUKE APPEARS TO HAVE
BROKEN DOWN COMPLETELY.
THE ORIGINAL MANUSCRIPT
IS SO SPLINTERED
THAT WE WERE FORCED
TO SEEK OUT THE ORIGINAL
TAPE RECORDING
AND TRANSCRIBE IT
VERBATIM."
Hunter:
TESTING-- ONE, TWO.
CLOSING.
OKAY, IT IS NOW 11:30 A.M.
Depp:
"THE TRANSCRIPTION
BEGINS SOMEWHERE
ON THE NORTHEAST OUTSKIRTS
OF LAS VEGAS--
ZOOMING ALONG PARADISE ROAD
IN THE WHITE WHALE."
( Hunter speaking )
( Acosta speaking )
( Hunter speaking )
( Acosta speaking )
( Hunter speaks )
- HELLO.
- MAY I HELP YOU?
- YEAH.YOU HAVE
TACOS HERE?
- MM-HMM.
BUT THEY'RE FIVE
FOR A DOLLAR?
I'LL TAKE
FIVE OF THEM.
DO YOU WANT
ANYTHING TO DRINK?
BEER.NO, I HAVE
BEER IN THE CAR--
TONS OF IT--
THE WHOLE BACK SEAT'S
LOADED WITH IT.
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.
WE WERE TOLD THAT
IT WAS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS AREA, BUT--
- THE AMERICAN DREAM?
- YEAH, THE AMERICAN DREAM.
- I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING--
GO TO PARADISE.
- IS THAT IT?
WE'RE HERE LOOKING FOR
IT BECAUSE THEY SENT
US OUT HERE,
ALL THE WAY
FROM SAN FRANCISCO,
TO LOOK FOR IT.
THAT'S WHY THEY GAVE US
THAT WHITE CADILLAC.
THEY FIGURED THAT
WE COULD CATCH UP
WITH IT IN THAT.
HEY, LUKE,
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS?
Acosta:
SHE'S ASKING HIM.
- WHAT IS IT?
- THAT'S WHAT
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE WERE SENT OUT HERE
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOOK
FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM.
NOW ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS?!
BECAUSE--
Acosta:
NO, LOOK AT THE CAR.
I MEAN, DO I LOOK LIKE--
COULD THAT BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS' CLUB?
IT WAS A DISCOTHEQUE PLACE.
ALL WE WERE TOLD WAS,
"GO TILL YOU FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
TAKE THIS WHITE CADILLAC
AND GO FIND
THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IT'S SOMEWHERE
IN THE LAS VEGAS AREA."
ARE YOU TAKING
PICTURES OF IT OR--
- NO NO NO, PICTURES, JUST--
- SOMEBODY JUST SENT YOU
ON A GOOSE CHASE.
IT'S SORT OF
A WILD GOOSE CHASE
MORE OR LESS, YEAH.
Woman:
IT HAS TO BE
THE OLD PSYCHIATRISTS'.
BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO HANG OUT THERE
IS A BUNCH
OF PUSHERS, PEDDLERS,
- UPPERS-AND-DOWNERS
AND ALL THAT STUFF.
- MAYBE THAT'S IT.
- DOPERS.
- COULD BE IT.
I THINK THIS PLACE,
THE WAY YOU'RE
DESCRIBING IT--
I THINK-- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE THAT'S IT.
( "Get Together"
playing )
Wenner:
HUNTER SAID, YOU KNOW,
VEGAS IS THE CITY
THAT WAS THE DEATH
OF WHAT HE THOUGHT
WAS THE AMERICAN DREAM.
IN THAT FAMOUS SCENE,
HE SEES THAT OPPORTUNITY
AND POSSIBILITY THAT WAS
REPRESENTED BY THE '60s.
"THE WAVE ROLLS BACK
AND," HE SAID, "ONCE FOR
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT THERE,
- WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT."
- * IT FEELS THE WAY
WE DIE... *
Duke's voice:
SAN FRANCISCO
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE '60s
WAS A VERY SPECIAL TIME
AND PLACE TO BE A PART OF,
BUT NO EXPLANATION,
NO MIX OF WORDS
OR MUSIC OR MEMORIES
CAN TOUCH THAT SENSE
OF KNOWING THAT YOU
WERE THERE
AND ALIVE IN THAT CORNER
OF TIME IN THE WORLD,
WHATEVER IT MEANT.
* AND YOU MAY NOT
KNOW WHY... *
Duke's voice:
THERE WAS MADNESS IN
ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR.
YOU COULD STRIKE
SPARKS ANYWHERE.
THERE WAS A FANTASTIC
UNIVERSAL SENSE
THAT WHATEVER
WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,
THAT WE WERE WINNING.
AND THAT, I THINK,
WAS THE HANDLE...
I have seen... the promised land.
I may not get there with you...
Duke's voice:
...THAT SENSE OF
INEVITABLE VICTORY
OVER THE FORCES
OF OLD AND EVIL.
NOT IN ANY MEAN
OR MILITARY SENSE;
<i>WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.</i>
<i>OUR ENERGY
WOULD SIMPLY PREVAIL.</i>
<i>WE HAD
ALL THE MOMENTUM.</i>
<i>WE WERE RIDING
THE CREST OF A HIGH
AND BEAUTIFUL WAVE.</i>
We, as a people,
will get to the promised land!
<i>Duke's voice:
SO NOW, LESS THAN
FIVE YEARS LATER,</i>
<i>YOU CAN GO UP
ON A STEEP HILL</i>
<i>IN LAS VEGAS
AND LOOK WEST</i>
AND WITH
THE RIGHT KIND OF EYES
YOU CAN ALMOST SEE
THE HIGH-WATER MARK,
THAT PLACE WHERE
THE WAVE FINALLY BROKE...
- AND ROLLED BACK.
- ( gunshot )
Martin Luther King was shot
and was killed tonight.
- ( gunshot )
- ( women scream )
Nabulsi:
IT'S AMAZING TO THINK
THAT IN 1971
HE ALREADY SAW
THAT FINAL NAIL
IN THE COFFIN OF THE '60s,
WHICH IS
REALLY BITTERSWEET.
AND I THINK FOR HUNTER
IT WAS BITTERSWEET,
SO I THINK SPEECH
SORT OF ENCAPSULATES THAT.
I HAVEN'T READ ANYTHING ELSE
ON THAT GENERATION,
THAT SUBJECT
THAT MOVES ME AS MUCH.
I FELT IT WAS
SO IMPORTANT.
TO ME, IT WAS
THE DRIVING THING
THAT MADE ME
WANNA DO THE MOVIE.
WELL, I DON'T LIKE
THE IDEA OF IT--
THAT ISN'T ONE
OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS
I'VE EVER WRITTEN--
TO TURN IT INTO SOME KIND OF
A STUPID CARTOON SHOW--
Woman:
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
THAT ANYBODY'S EVER WRITTEN.
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
A VERY HIGH AFFECTION
FOR THAT ONE PIECE
AND SO DO OTHER PEOPLE.
Nabulsi:
BEFORE TERRY GILLIAM WAS
HIRED TO DIRECT THE FILM,
THERE WAS ANOTHER DIRECTOR,
BUT THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT
WHEN HE WANTED TO PUT
THIS ANIMATED SEQUENCE
IN THE WAVE SPEECH
OF THIS LITTLE HUNTER
ON A WAVE OF BONES.
YOU CAN SEE
THAT I MIGHT BE
A LITTLE BIT EDGY
WHEN YOU TALK
ABOUT PUTTING IT
IN A CARTOON FORM
WITH ME ON
SOME KIND OF TIDAL WAVE
ACROSS SOME IMAGINARY
MICKEY MOUSE DESERT.
Man:
YOU'VE BEEN PUT
IN A CARTOON FORM ALREADY.
THE PROBLEM IS
THAT YOU'VE PUBLISHED
A NOVEL WITH CARTOONS.
- I HIRED RALPH
TO DO SOME DRAWINGS.
- AND THEY'RE GREAT.
- No no no no.
- You're really
getting me angry.
Nabulsi:
I KNOW HUNTER
WELL ENOUGH
THAT EVEN IF HE WAS MAD,
I'M NOT TERRIFIED
AND I KNOW HOW
TO GET THROUGH IT,
BUT I WAS JUST
SORT OF SHOCKED
THAT IT HAD GONE
SO AWRY.
Hunter on TV:
Just don't fucking go
and make it a cartoon!
All right, we're having
a little problem here
with your goddamn
stupid fucking cartoons
in this thing.
If you think
you're in charge
of this movie,
we're gonna have
a real problem right now.
IF YOU WANT WAR--
HERE WE GO, BABY--
THERE'S GONNA BE
A NASTY FUCKING WAR.
YEAH, BUT I DON'T LIKE
YOU TURNING ON ME
AT THE END.
I MUST SAY
I DON'T LIKE
THAT AT ALL.
Hunter:
WHAT SHOULD I HAVE SAID?
"NO, I'VE KNOWN LAILA
FOR MANY YEARS...
- ( all laughing )
- ...AND SHE WOULD
NEVER SAY THAT."
- Man #2: FUCK.
- HE HAD A KIND OF
OVER-THE-TOP
DRAMATIC WAY OF BEING.
YEAH, I'LL TALK TO HUNTER NOW.
YEAH, OKAY.
HUNTER, HOW ARE YA?
Wenner:
HUNTER ALWAYS HAD
TO HAVE A RUNNING CRISIS.
GOING ON
OF SOME TYPE OF OTHER--
TO ANIMATE HIM,
TO GET HIM GOING.
WHAT DISEASE?
I MEAN, DO YOU-- IS IT
A POTENTIALLY SERIOUS THING?
BRAIN-- BRAIN DAMAGE.
I SEE.
Jimmy Buffet:
HUNTER DID EVERYTHING
FOR EFFECT.
HE WAS NOT EVER HAPPY,
I DON'T BELIEVE,
WHEN THINGS WERE
STABLE AND TRANQUIL.
Crouse:
HUNTER WAS
A FORCE OF NATURE.
HUNTER WOULD SIT
VERY STILL
AND VERY STRAIGHT
WITH HIS ARMS UP
LIKE THIS, WAITING.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
HE WOULD GET A JOLT
AND HE WOULD TYPE.
HE ALSO HAD DEADLINES,
AND HUNTER NEVER MET
A DEADLINE.
HE WAS COMPLETELY
BEHIND DEADLINE.
HE HADN'T WRITTEN
A WORD AND JANN WAS
CALLING AND SCREAMING.
HUNTER WAS, AT THAT TIME,
CARRYING AROUND
THE MOJO WIRE...
Announcer:
Just insert the document--
...WHICH WAS
A SUITCASE-SIZED PORTABLE
TRANSMISSION MACHINE.
Announcer:
In just six minutes
or less,
an exact copy
of the document
can be received anywhere
in the country.
HE SAID, "I'VE GOTTA
DO THE STORY." I SAID,
"YOU HAVEN'T WRITTEN THE STORY."
"IT DOESN'T MATTER.
JUST-- WHEN I TELL YOU TO,
JUST TAKE THE PLUG
AND UNPLUG IT--
IN AND OUT--
ON THE MACHINE."
HE CALLED UP
"ROLLING STONE" OFFICES,
"WELL, IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE WORKING."
THE ENTIRE PLACE IS
SHUT DOWN
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
HAS BEEN DONE EXCEPT
THESE FOUR PAGES
- YOU'VE BEEN
HOLDING FOR HUNTER.
- I WAS USUALLY THE GUY,
AT 2:00 OR 3:00
IN THE MORNING,
WHO HAD TO BE THERE TO GET
THE FEED FROM HUNTER.
HE TOOK THE FAX MACHINE,
HELD THE PHONE LIKE THIS
AND DESTROYED IT.
AND THEN HE WENT
INTO THIS RAVE
ABOUT SOME EDITOR
ON THE OTHER END,
THEN HUNG THE PHONE UP
AND WENT TO THE BAR.
Perry:
JANN WAS GENERALLY SO HAPPY
WITH THE KIND OF STUFF
THAT HUNTER WAS TURNING IN
THAT IT DIDN'T MATTER.
IT WAS JUST MERELY
A DAMN INCONVENIENCE FOR US.
Young Wenner:
THE EDITOR'S NOTE SAYS
"AFTER LONG,
HEAVY AND OCCASIONALLY
BRUTAL NEGOTIATIONS,
DR. THOMPSON IS
BACK ON THE PAYROLL.
HIS GIBBERISH WILL
APPEAR REGULARLY
IN AN UNPREDICTABLE LENGTH
ON A WIDE VARIETY
OF SUBJECT MATTER.
WE HAVE TOTAL CONFIDENCE
IN HIM, FOR GOOD OR ILL."
Wenner:
AFTER "VEGAS,"
IT WAS CLEAR
WHAT AN ENORMOUS TALENT
HUNTER WAS,
AND, WITH THE ENERGY
AND THE REPORTING LEVEL,
HE WAS GOING TO BE
BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE
AT "ROLLING STONE."
WOULD YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER PLACE
TO PUBLISH YOUR STUFF
IF IT WASN'T
FOR "ROLLING STONE"?
Wenner:
SO IT WAS ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR WHAT WOULD BE NEXT.
WHAT WOULD BE
THE NEXT ASSIGNMENT?
WHAT'S THE BIGGEST THING
WE COULD THINK OF?
I CAME UP WITH THE IDEA
THAT HE SHOULD MOVE
TO WASHINGTON,
BECOME THE FULL-TIME
CORRESPONDENT
FOR THE McGOVERN CAMPAIGN.
TWO OF THE CLASSICAL WORKS
OF AMERICAN POLITICS
CAME OUT OF THAT CAMPAIGN
AND OUT OF THAT ASSIGNMENT
FOR "ROLLING STONE."
ONE IS "FEAR AND LOATHING:
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL"
BY HUNTER;
AND "BOYS ON THE BUS"
BY TIM CROUSE,
WHO WAS ONE
OF OUR LITTLE JUNIOR STARS.
BUT HE WANTED TO BE UP THERE
AND COVER THE CAMPAIGN,
SO I SAID, "SURE.
GO RIGHT AHEAD. YOU CAN HELP
HUNTER WHILE YOU'RE AT IT."
PART OF THE REASON
I WAS THERE
WAS TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.
AND WHAT I FELT FROM HIM
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS
A SENSE OF PROTECTION.
AND WE BECAME
A VERY GOOD TEAM THAT WAY.
Young Wenner:
IF YOU WERE REALLY INTERESTED
IN WHAT WAS HAPPENING
ON THE McGOVERN CAMPAIGN,
THE ELECTION,
YOU WOULD'VE ALSO--
ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT
AS WIDELY KNOWN--
TURNED TO "ROLLING STONE"
TO FIND OUT REALLY
WHAT WAS GOING ON.
HUNTER'S COVERAGE
AND RECORD OF IT--
HIS COVERAGE WAS
JUST BRILLIANT.
( Wenner and Hunter
speaking )
Pat Caddell: WHEN HE
SHOWED UP AT THE CAMPAIGN,
NO ONE KNEW WHO HE WAS.
BUT I'M STILL IN COLLEGE,
SO I READ "ROLLING STONE,"
SO I KNEW WHO HE WAS.
NOBODY ELSE KNEW.
THAT WAS
HIS GREAT ADVANTAGE--
NOBODY WAS PAYING
ATTENTION TO HIM...
UNTIL HE STARTED PUBLISHING,
THEN ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE.
Depp:
"SO THIS IS MORE
OF A JANGLED CAMPAIGN DIARY
THAN A RECORD
OR REASONED ANALYSIS
OF THE '72
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
FROM DECEMBER '71
TO JANUARY '73
IN AIRPORT BARS,
ALL-NIGHT COFFEE SHOPS
AND DREARY HOTEL ROOMS
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
THERE IS HARDLY
A PARAGRAPH IN THIS SAGA
THAT WASN'T
PRODUCED IN A LAST-MINUTE
TEETH-GRINDING FRENZY.
EVERY DEADLINE WAS
A CRISIS
WHEN I WAS CRANKING IT
OUT OF THE TYPEWRITER
ONE PAGE AT A TIME
AND FEEDING IT
- INTO THE PLASTIC MAW
OF THAT GODDAMN MOJO WIRE...
- ( fax buzzing )
...TO SOME HASH-ADDLED FREAK
OF AN EDITOR
AT THE 'ROLLING STONE'
NEWS DESK IN SAN FRANCISCO."
THERE. CHEW ON THAT
GIBBERISH FOR A WHILE,
YOU HEARTLESS SCUM.
- ( buzzing )
- YOU PUSHED ME TOO FAR.
( buzzing frantically )
( buzzing stops )
( gunshot )
McGovern:
I COULDN'T READ THAT BOOK,
"FEAR AND LOATHING,"
WITHOUT BEING IN A PLACE
WHERE I COULD LAUGH OUT LOUD
FROM TIME TO TIME.
IT WAS A HILARIOUS BOOK.
I HAVE BEEN QUOTED MANY TIMES
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN--
IT WAS THE MOST ACCURATE
AND LEAST FACTUAL ACCOUNT
OF THAT CAMPAIGN.
( all laugh )
McGovern:
I'LL SAY ONE OTHER THING:
THAT BOOK WAS WRITTEN
FOR "ROLLING STONE"
AS THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSED.
IT WASN'T SOMETHING WRITTEN
FROM THE HINDSIGHT
OF THE CAMPAIGN.
THOSE CHAPTERS ROLLED OFF
OF HIS TYPEWRITER
AS THE CAMPAIGN MOVED ALONG.
Perry:
IT WAS A JOURNALISTIC RISK.
HE HAD COVERED
POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS BEFORE
HE WAS JUST SICK
OF THE CONVENTIONS,
SITTING AROUND
AND REPORTING THE SPEECHES.
AND THE SPEECHES WERE
ALL WRITTEN FOR REPORTERS
TO WRITE ABOUT.
Depp:
"AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED,
THERE WAS NO SUCH THING
AS 'OFF THE RECORD.'
UNLIKE MOST
OTHER CORRESPONDENTS
I COULD AFFORD TO BURN
ALL MY BRIDGES BEHIND ME,
'CAUSE I WAS ONLY THERE
FOR A YEAR.
AND THE LAST THING
I CARED ABOUT
WAS ESTABLISHING
LONG-TERM CONNECTIONS
ON CAPITOL HILL."
HE WANTED
TO STIR THINGS UP.
Buchanan:
THERE WAS NO ONE
QUITE LIKE HUNTER.
HE WAS ON THE EDGE
AND BEYOND THE EDGE,
AND IT WAS VERY FUNNY.
I REMEMBER HE WROTE
THAT HUBERT HUMPHREY,
THE GREAT FATHER
OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT--
HE SAID, "THEY OUGHT TO STUFF
HUBERT IN A GODDAMN BOTTLE
AND SEND HIM OUT
WITH THE JAPANESE CURRENT."
Depp:
"THERE IS NO WAY TO GRASP
WHAT A SHALLOW, CONTEMPTIBLE
AND HOPELESSLY
DISHONEST OLD HACK
HUBERT HUMPHREY REALLY IS
UNTIL YOU'VE FOLLOWED
HIM AROUND FOR A WHILE
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
HUBERT HUMPHREY IS
A TREACHEROUS,
GUTLESS OLD WARD-HEELER."
Buchanan:
HE HAD A VIEW OF THE
RIDICULOUSNESS OF IT ALL...
THANK YOU.
SHALOM SHALOM.
...AND HUNTER DID
SOME OF HIS BEST WORK
ON THE LIBERALS.
McGovern:
HE WAS PARTICULARLY
HOSTILE TO HUBERT,
BUT HE CERTAINLY
LOATHED RICHARD NIXON.
Depp:
"OUR BARBIE DOLL PRESIDENT
WITH HIS BARBIE DOLL WIFE
AND HIS BOXFUL
OF BARBIE DOLL CHILDREN
IS ALSO AMERICA'S ANSWER
TO THE MONSTROUS MR. HYDE.
HE SPEAKS
TO THE WEREWOLF IN US
ON NIGHTS WHEN THE MOON
COMES TOO CLOSE."
NIXON REPRESENTS
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG
WITH THIS COUNTRY...
DOWN THE LINE.
Buchanan:
WELL, HE FIRST CAME
INTO OUR CONSCIOUSNESS
IN THE BEGINNING OF 1968.
HE WAS WRITING FOR
"PAGEANT" MAGAZINE.
HE CAME UP TO COVER US.
I WAS WITH NIXON IN THE
NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY
AND HUNTER WOULD
IMPORTUNE ME TO GET
SOME TIME WITH THE CANDIDATE.
SO WE GOT HUNTER--
AS I RECALL IT--
WE PUT HIM
IN THE CAR WITH NIXON
IN THE BACKSEAT
OF THE LIMO
WHEN NIXON WAS GOING
TO MANCHESTER AIRPORT.
Man: WASN'T IT IN 1968
YOU TRIED TO INTERVIEW NIXON?
Hunter:
NO, I DID IT. I HAD
A WONDERFUL TALK WITH HIM.
WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT?
FOOTBALL. I WAS
THE ONLY PERSON
IN THE PRESS CORPS
WHO COULD TALK
ABOUT FOOTBALL.
IS THIS A NEED THAT
OCCURS TO HIM DURING--
OH, YEAH.
HE'S A COMPLETE
FOOTBALL FREAK.
AND I SAID, "NO,
OF COURSE. I'M A FREAK.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT."
HE SAID, "BUT YOU--
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS
TO TALK ABOUT VIETNAM
AND THAT KIND OF THING."
I SAID, "NO, I'LL TALK
ABOUT FOOTBALL.
DON'T WORRY."
HE SAID,
"OKAY, IF YOU PROMISE,
THEN YOU CAN RIDE
IN THE CAR WITH HIM
BACK TO THE AIRPORT."
IT'S ABOUT AN HOUR
AND A HALF RIDE,
JUST ME A NIXON
IN THE BACKSEAT.
WAS HE
AN AMIABLE FELLOW?
OH, ABSOLUTELY. YEAH.
IT WAS KIND OF PLEASANT.
IT WAS WEIRD.
( chanting )
FOUR MORE YEARS,
FOUR MORE YEARS...
TONIGHT I AGAIN
PROUDLY ACCEPT
THAT NOMINATION
- FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
- ( crowd cheering )
Hunter:
RICHARD NIXON REPRESENTS
EVERYTHING THAT I...
NOT ONLY HAVE CONTEMPT FOR
BUT DISLIKE AND THINK
SHOULD BE STOMPED OUT.
Depp:
"HE WAS A CHEAP CROOK
AND A MERCILESS WAR CRIMINAL
WHO BOMBED MORE PEOPLE
TO DEATH IN LAOS AND CAMBODIA
THAN THE U.S. ARMY LOST
IN ALL OF WORLD WAR II.
WHEN STUDENTS
AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY
IN OHIO PROTESTED
THE BOMBING,
HE CONNIVED TO HAVE THEM
ATTACKED AND SLAIN
- BY TROOPS FROM
THE NATIONAL GUARD."
- ( gunfire )
"SOME PEOPLE WILL SAY
THAT WORDS LIKE 'SCUM'
AND 'ROTTEN'
ARE WRONG
FOR OBJECTIVE JOURNALISM,
WHICH IS TRUE.
BUT THEY MISS THE POINT.
IT WAS
THE BUILT-IN BLIND SPOTS
OF THE OBJECTIVE
RULES AND DOGMA
THAT ALLOWED
NIXON TO SLITHER
INTO THE WHITE HOUSE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.
HE SEEMED
SO ALL-AMERICAN."
* AND THE SKIES ARE
NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY. *
Depp:
"YOU HAD TO GET SUBJECTIVE
TO SEE NIXON CLEARLY.
HE WAS SO CROOKED
THAT HE NEEDED SERVANTS
TO HELP HIM SCREW
ON HIS PANTS EVERY MORNING."
I AM FILLING WITH
HATE AND RAGE RIGHT NOW
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.
Gary Hart:
I HAD NEVER TRIED
TO PSYCHOANALYZE HUNTER
IN MOOD SWINGS
AND SO ON,
BUT I THINK
IN HIS BAD MOMENTS
OR WORSE MOMENTS
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
ALL FEAR AND LOATHING.
Crouse:
"FEAR AND LOATHING
IN LAS VEGAS"
IS OSTENSIBLY
ABOUT A MAN IN SEARCH
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
AND "FEAR AND LOATHING:
ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL"
IS ABOUT A MAN IN SEARCH
OF AN HONEST POLITICIAN.
AND THE ONLY ONE IN SIGHT
WHO EVEN VAGUELY QUALIFIED
- WAS GEORGE McGOVERN.
- WHEN YOU SUPPORT
GEORGE McGOVERN--
AT THE POSITION
I AM IN THE POLLS,
THAT'S AN ACT OF COURAGE.
Depp:
"GEORGE McGOVERN--
THE ONLY CANDIDATE
IN EITHER PARTY
WORTH VOTING FOR
IS HUNG
IN A FRUSTRATED LIMBO
CREATED MAINLY
BY THE GROSS CYNICISM
OF THE WASHINGTON
PRESS CORPS.
'HE'D BE A FINE PRESIDENT,'
THEY SAY,
'BUT OF COURSE
HE CAN'T POSSIBLY WIN.'
- WHY NOT?"
- I JUST WANTED
TO SAY HELLO.
I'M SENATOR McGOVERN, FOLKS.
NICE TO SEE YOU.
YES, YOU TOO.
YOU FELLAS KNOW
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?
I HOPE YOU'LL HELP ME OUT.
( crowd cheering )
Crouse:
McGOVERN'S PROGRAM WAS
IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL
FROM VIETNAM...
McGovern:
EVEN IF WE STAYED THERE
AND BOMBED
FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
AND AMERICANS
CONTINUE TO DIE,
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW
WE'RE GOING TO BE RIGHT
WHERE WE ARE NOW.
SO LET'S RECOGNIZE
THAT WE MADE A MISTAKE.
LET'S BRING
THIS WAR TO AN END.
...AMNESTY FOR DRAFT DODGERS
AND DESERTERS,
EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN
AND-- AND A CUT
IN THE DEFENSE BUDGET.
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
McGovern:
THE TRANSCENDENT ISSUE
OF '72 WAS VIETNAM,
AND I DESPERATELY WANTED
TO WIN THAT ELECTION
TO PUT AN END
TO THAT SENSELESS WAR.
I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF OLD MEN SITTING AROUND
IN AIR-CONDITIONED ROOMS
HERE IN WASHINGTON
DREAMING UP WARS
FOR YOUNG MEN TO DIE IN.
McGovern:
IT IS A TIDE
THAT WOULD SWEEP AWAY
THE BARBARISM OF WAR
AND END THE FOLLY
OF VIETNAM ONCE AND FOR ALL.
( cheering )
Depp:
"McGOVERN IS
THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE
WHO LINES OUT
THE PAINFUL TRUTH,
AND HIS REWARD HAS BEEN
JUST ABOUT THE SAME
AS THAT OF ANY OTHER
POLITICIAN WHO INSISTS
ON TELLING THE TRUTH:
HE IS MOCKED, VILIFIED,
IGNORED AND ABANDONED
AS A HOPELESS LOSER."
THE PRESIDENT
IS ATTACKING...
Hart:
HUNTER NEVER TRUSTED
ANYBODY WHO WAS ELECTED.
THAT WAS THE IRONY,
BECAUSE TO BE ESTIMABLE
IN HIS JUDGMENT
YOU HAD TO BE
A LOSER, IN EFFECT.
A NOBLE LOSER.
Brinkley:
WHAT WAS BOLD
ABOUT HUNTER WITH McGOVERN
IS HE WASN'T
BEING OBJECTIVE.
HE WAS SAYING
"THIS IS THE GUY I WANT
TO SEE AS PRESIDENT.
I'M GONNA TRY TO HELP
MAKE HIM PRESIDENT."
- ( woman screaming )
- ( gun fires )
McGovern:
LEAVING OUT GEORGE WALLACE,
WHO WAS SHOT,
THE TWO STRONGEST
DEMOCRATIC CONTENDERS
WERE MUSKIE AND HUMPHREY.
THEREFORE,
HUNTER SAW THEM
AS A THREAT
TO BE UNMASKED,
BECAUSE BY THEN I THINK
HE WAS PRETTY STRONGLY
COMMITTED TO ME.
Crouse:
HUNTER'S PIECES WERE
A VERY PARTICULAR HYBRID
OF VERY CLEAR-MINDED,
ACCURATE
STRAIGHT REPORTAGE
AND THEN SOMETIMES
FLAT-OUT FANTASY.
IT WAS ALL RUN TOGETHER,
AND SOME PEOPLE
FOUND IT HARD
TO TELL THE FANTASY
FROM THE OTHER STUFF.
IT OCCURRED TO ME
ABOUT HALFWAY DURING
THE CAMPAIGN
THAT PEOPLE
ACTUALLY BELIEVED
A LOT OF THE THINGS
I WAS WRITING ABOUT--
MUSKIE EATING
THIS STRANGE BRAZILIAN DRUG.
HUNTER HAD IT IN FOR MUSKIE
LIKE YOU COULDN'T BELIEVE.
HUNTER JUST COULD NOT
LAY OFF OF MUSKIE.
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO ED MUSKIE?
NOTHING.
ED MUSKIE DID IT
TO HIMSELF.
I JUST HELPED HIM ALONG.
Depp:
"NOT MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT THE IBOGAINE EFFECT
AS A SERIOUS FACTOR
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN,
BUT TOWARD THE END
OF THE WISCONSIN PRIMARY RACE,
ABOUT A WEEK
BEFORE THE VOTE,
WORD LEAKED OUT THAT SOME
OF MUSKIE'S TOP ADVISORS
HAD CALLED IN
A BRAZILIAN DOCTOR
WHO WAS SAID TO BE
TREATING THE CANDIDATE
WITH 'SOME KIND OF
STRANGE DRUG.'"
WHAT WAS THE DRUG
THAT YOU SAID HE WAS ON?
- IBOGAINE.
- IBOGAINE.
Perry:
FIRST WE SAW HIS WORK,
THEN WE HAD TO LOOK IT UP
AND THEN
WE STARTED WONDERING
WHETHER SOMEBODY
COULD SUE US ABOUT THIS.
THEN WE REALIZED
HOW SILLY THAT WOULD BE,
SO WE WENT AHEAD WITH IT.
Caddell:
"ROLLING STONE" REPORTS
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE EDMUND MUSKIE
IS IN FACT ADDICTED.
IT ENDED UP ON THE WIRES
AS A STRAIGHT STORY.
IT CAUSED
A MAJOR SENSATION.
IT WAS JUST THIS MAGICAL
LYRICAL MOMENT OF HUNTER'S.
Depp:
"IT HAD BEEN COMMON KNOWLEDGE
FOR MANY WEEKS
THAT HUMPHREY WAS
USING AN EXOTIC BRAND
OF SPEED KNOWN AS 'WALLOT.'
AND IT HAD
LONG BEEN WHISPERED
THAT MUSKIE WAS
INTO SOMETHING VERY HEAVY,
BUT IT WAS HARD TO TAKE
THE TALK SERIOUSLY UNTIL
I HEARD ABOUT THE APPEARANCE
OF A MYSTERIOUS
BRAZILIAN DOCTOR.
THAT WAS THE KEY."
( all speaking
Portuguese )
BY ATTACKING ME,
HE'S PROVED HIMSELF
TO BE A GUTLESS COWARD.
Depp:
"I IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED
THE IBOGAINE EFFECT
FROM MUSKIE'S
TEARFUL BREAKDOWN
ON THE FLATBED TRUCK
IN NEW HAMPSHIRE..."
Perry: HE SAID,
"WELL, LOOK AT THE WAY
THE GUY GIVES
HIS SPEECHES.
IT EXACTLY FITS
THE SYMPTOMS
OF SOMEBODY
WHO'S STONED ON IBOGAINE."
AND THE CHARGE WAS
SO BIZARRE, SO OFF-THE-WALL,
IT REALLY BROUGHT
A LOT OF ATTENTION
TO HUNTER'S REPORTING.
DO YOU MIND
IF I STATE MY VIEW?
Depp:
"...TO THE DELUSIONS
AND ALTERED THINKING
THAT CHARACTERIZED
HIS CAMPAIGN IN WISCONSIN,
AND FINALLY THE CONDITION
OF 'TOTAL RAGE'
THAT GRIPPED HIM
IN FLORIDA."
BUT I AM SPEAKING
TO THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE
WILLING TO LISTEN TO ME!
Man:
THE RUMOR BEGAN
TO SPREAD EVERYWHERE
AMONG ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO WERE COVERING
THE CAMPAIGN
THAT MUSKIE WAS IN FACT
ON THIS BIZARRE DRUG.
- YOU FINALLY SAID
YOU MADE IT ALL UP.
- I HAD TO.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE PEOPLE
TOOK THIS STUFF SERIOUSLY.
PEOPLE REALLY BELIEVED THAT
MUSKIE WAS EATING IBOGAINE.
I NEVER SAID HE WAS.
I SAID THERE WAS A RUMOR
IN MILWAUKEE THAT HE WAS...
WHICH WAS TRUE.
I STARTED THE RUMOR
IN MILWAUKEE.
- ( audience laughing )
- YEAH, IF YOU'RE
REALLY CAREFUL--
I'M A VERY ACCURATE
JOURNALIST.
Depp:
"MUSKIE'S ALWAYS
TAKEN PRIDE
IN HIS ABILITY
TO DEAL WITH HECKLERS.
HE'S FREQUENTLY
CHALLENGED THEM,
CALLING THEM UP TO THE STAGE
IN FRONT OF BIG CROWDS
AND THE FORCING THE POOR
BASTARDS TO DEBATE WITH HIM
IN A BLAZE OF TV LIGHTS.
BUT THERE WAS NONE
OF THAT IN FLORIDA.
WHEN THE BOOHOO BEGAN
GRABBING AT HIS LEGS
AND SCREAMING
FOR MORE GIN,
BIG ED WENT
ALL TO PIECES,
WHICH GAVE RISE
TO SPECULATION
AMONG REPORTERS
FAMILIAR WITH
HIS CAMPAIGN STYLE
IN '68 AND '70
THAT MUSKIE
WAS NOT HIMSELF."
...SHREDDED, TORN,
BATTERED AND BEATEN
BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION.
Depp:
"IN RETROSPECT, HOWEVER,
IT IS EASY TO SEE
WHY MUSKIE FELL APART
ON THAT CABOOSE PLATFORM
IN THE MIAMI TRAIN STATION.
IT IS ENTIRELY CONCEIVABLE,
GIVEN THE KNOWN EFFECTS
OF IBOGAINE,
THAT MUSKIE'S BRAIN WAS
ALMOST PARALYZED
BY HALLUCINATIONS
AT THE TIME,
THAT HE LOOKED OUT
AT THE CROWD
AND SAW GILA MONSTERS
INSTEAD OF PEOPLE.
THAT HIS MIND
SNAPPED COMPLETELY
WHEN HE FELT SOMETHING LARGE
AND APPARENTLY VICIOUS
CLAWING AT HIS LEGS."
THAT'S CRAZY STUFF.
NOBODY WAS
WRITING LIKE THAT.
I MEAN, IN THE SERIOUS WORLD
OF POLITICAL JOURNALISM
THEY THOUGHT
THAT WAY OF HUNTER,
THAT HE WAS
GETTING AWAY WITH STUFF
THAT THEY COULDN'T
IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING.
AND THEY ALL LIVED
VICARIOUSLY THROUGH HIM.
Crouse:
THE SOCIAL SCENE
OF THE PRESS--
IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS
ALMOST ALL MALES
AND THEY ALMOST
ALL DRANK PRETTY SERIOUSLY.
AND HUNTER, HE WAS
KIND OF IMPERVIOUS MAN
WHEN IT CAME
TO DRUGS AND TO LIQUOR.
YOU SAW
THAT STUFF GO IN
AND THERE WAS
NO DISCERNABLE EFFECT
IN HIS BEHAVIOR.
AND THAT LEFT
AN IMPRESSION
ON THE PEOPLE
HE WAS WITH.
HUNTER COULDN'T
RESIST, EVER,
TRYING TO SHOCK
THE SQUARES.
HUNTER WOULD TURN
TO ME AND SAY,
"MAYBE AT THE NEXT STOP
WE CAN SHOOT UP,"
OR "HEY, IF THEY HAVE
A MEN'S ROOM,
IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO EAT SOME ACID."
AND HUNTER,
IN THIS SENSE,
ALMOST HAD
THE ATTRIBUTES
OF AN ACTION HERO.
McGovern:
I GOT A CALL FROM HUNTER.
HE INVITED ELEANOR AND ME
TO MEET HIM FOR DINNER.
WHEN WE GOT THERE,
THE WAITRESS MATERIALIZED
AND HE SAID,
"BRING ME THREE MARGARITAS
AND SIX BEERS,"
AND THE GIRL LAUGHED.
SHE SAID, "ARE YOU EXPECTING
SOME OTHER PEOPLE, SIR?"
HE SAID, "NO. FIND OUT
WHAT THESE TWO FOLKS WANT,
BUT BRING ME
THREE MARGARITAS
AND SIX BEERS."
( laughs )
Hart:
I DON'T THINK HUNTER EVER
THOUGHT McGOVERN WAS GONNA WIN.
I THINK HE WAS ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.
THIS THING PICKS UP
SPEED FAST, DOESN'T IT?
Man:
OH YEAH,
SO IS YOUR CAMPAIGN.
Hart:
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
THIS THING BEGINS
TO BE SERIOUS.
Man:
OF THE SIX
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES,
WHICH ONE ARE
YOU SUPPORTING
IN THE PRIMARY?
- McGOVERN?
- WHY?
BECAUSE I THINK THAT
HE'S THE ONLY MAN THAT
CAN UNITE THE COUNTRY.
- GEORGE McGOVERN.
- Man: WHY?
BECAUSE I THINK
HE'S THE PEOPLE'S MAN.
UH, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
- Man: WALLACE?
- NO NO NO. NO.
- LINDSAY?
- NO.
- HUMPHREY?
- NO.
- MUSKIE?
- NO.
- McGOVERN?
- YES, YOU'VE GOT IT
RIGHT THERE.
I THINK YOU'RE COMING
ON GOOD TO LABOR PEOPLE.
- YEAH.
- Hart: I THINK
HUNTER REALIZED
THAT THE MAN
HE WAS FOLLOWING MIGHT
ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE.
Man:
MUSKIE, JACKSON,
LINDSAY TRAIL BADLY.
WHAT THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?
WE WON BY A LANDSLIDE.
THE PRESS COVERAGE IS
UNBELIEVABLE.
HE'S GONNA BE
ON THE COVER OF "NEWSWEEK,"
PROBABLY THE COVER
OF "TIME,"
AND THEY'RE CALLING HIM
THE FRONTRUNNER
FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION.
NOW WE'VE GOT TO WORRY.
( cheering )
Man:
Senator George McGovern,
having received
the majority vote
of this convention
of certified delegates,
is hereby declared
the 1972 Democratic nominee
for President
of the United States.
Depp:
"McGOVERN APPEARED
TO HAVE A SURE LOCK
ON THE WHITE HOUSE
WHEN THE SUN CAME UP
ON MIAMI BEACH ON THE MORNING
OF THURSDAY, JULY 13TH.
SINCE THEN HE HAS
CRIPPLED HIMSELF
WITH A SERIES OF ALMOST
UNBELIEVABLE BLUNDERS."
Hart:
THE POLLS GOING
INTO THAT WEEKEND
SHOWED McGOVERN
WITH A CHANCE TO WIN.
NOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TO DEFEAT AN INCUMBENT,
PARTICULARLY AT WAR TIME,
SO YOU HAD TO HAVE
EVERYTHING GO RIGHT.
YOU COULD NOT HAVE
ONE THING GO WRONG.
AND OF COURSE
WE HAD A HUGE MAJOR THING
GO WRONG WITHIN HOURS.
THERE WAS THIS DISASTER
WITH THE CHOICE
FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT--
THOMAS EAGLETON,
SENATOR FROM MISSOURI.
Frank Mankiewicz:
HE MEETS THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS
SENATOR McGOVERN
SET DOWN WHEN HE BEGAN
HIS CONSIDERATION,
WHICH IS A MAN
IN WHOM HE WOULD HAVE
ABSOLUTE
AND COMPLETE CONFIDENCE
AND IN WHOM HE BELIEVES
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD
HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE
TO BECOME PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD
AN OCCASION ARISE.
I THINK IT WAS
MANKIEWICZ WHO ASKED HIM
IF HE HAD ANY SKELETONS
IN HIS CLOSET AND HE SAID NO.
TOM SAID HE COULDN'T
THINK OF ANYTHING
AND THEN THE CLOCK
STARTED TO TICK.
Hart:
THE WEEKEND AFTER
THE CONVENTION IN MIAMI
WE HAD GOTTEN
AN ANONYMOUS CALL
AT HEADQUARTERS
SAYING THAT
SENATOR EAGLETON HAD HAD...
SHOCK THERAPY,
WHICH WE HAD NOT KNOWN.
- ( speaking indistinctly )
- * WELL, I THINK I'M GOING
OUT OF MY HEAD *
* YES, I THINK
I'M GOING OUT OF MY HEAD *
* OVER YOU...
ON THREE OCCASIONS
IN MY LIFE,
I HAVE VOLUNTARILY GONE
INTO HOSPITALS
AS A RESULT
OF NERVOUS EXHAUSTION
AND FATIGUE.
Buchanan: I'D BEEN
IN ST. LOUIS. I'D HEARD
ABOUT THE EAGLETON STUFF,
EVEN BEFORE--
WHEN THEY NOMINATED HIM.
IT WOULD SURPRISE ME
WHEN THEY NOMINATED HIM.
WHEN THAT HIT,
THAT WAS THE COUP DE GRACE.
I WAS IN NIXON'S OFFICE
AND THERE WAS
WHAT I WOULD SAY WAS
CONSIDERABLE MERRIMENT.
NIXON SAID,
"WELL, PAT TOLD US,
DIDN'T HE, CHUCK?"
Depp:
"TOM EAGLETON WAS EXACTLY
THE KIND OF VP CANDIDATE
THAT MUSKIE OR HUMPHREY
WOULD HAVE CHOSEN--
A PEACE OFFERING
TO THE OLD POLITICS GANG,
BECAUSE McGOVERN
THOUGHT HE NEEDED
THOSE BASTARDS
TO BEAT NIXON."
IS IT YOUR INTENTION
THEN TO REMAIN
ON THE TICKET?
- CATEGORICALLY, YES.
- Depp: "IT'S HARD TO SEE
HOW GEORGE COULD HAVE
DONE ANY WORSE,
EVEN WITH CHARLES MANSON
FOR A RUNNING MATE."
Hart:
ALL OF A SUDDEN, HUNTER JUMPS
ON THAT CRITICAL BANDWAGON.
HIS WHOLE CRITIQUE OF McGOVERN
IN THE FALL CAMPAIGN WAS
"SELLOUT, COMPROMISER."
BUT YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS
ABOUT AMERICAN POLITICS
AND BE INFANTILE ABOUT IT.
AND THERE WAS
AN INFANTILE--
I SAY THIS
WITH ALL RESPECT
TO MY LATE FRIEND--
AN INFANTILE ASPECT
TO HUNTER.
HE WANTED
IT ALL TO BE FUN,
ALL TO BE AMUSING,
ALL TO BE GOOD AND EVIL,
AND "WE'RE THE GOOD GUYS,
THEY'RE THE BAD GUYS
AND WE'RE GONNA
CRUSH 'EM,"
AND OVERDRAMATIZING
WHAT IS REALLY SOME
OF THE TOUGHEST THINGS
HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TO DO,
AND THAT IS TO TRY
TO GOVERN A DEMOCRACY.
McGovern:
THE PUBLIC DEBATE
OF SENATOR EAGLETON'S
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
CONTINUES
TO DIVERT ATTENTION
FROM THE GREAT
NATIONAL ISSUES
THAT NEED
TO BE DISCUSSED.
THEREFORE WE HAVE
JOINTLY AGREED
THAT THE BEST COURSE IS
FOR SENATOR EAGLETON
- TO STEP ASIDE.
- ( applause )
Crouse:
WHEN McGOVERN FINALLY
HAD TO GIVE IN,
IT MADE McGOVERN
LOOK LIKE A LIAR,
IT MADE HIM LOOK
LIKE A WAFFLER.
IT WAS A BLOW
FROM WHICH THE CAMPAIGN
NEVER REALLY COVERED.
WISH I WORE
MY DRIP-DRY SUIT.
McGovern:
THE NATIONAL PRESS WASN'T
VERY RESPONSIBLE AT THAT TIME.
I DON'T CONDEMN
THE PRESS.
THEY WERE DOING WHAT
THEY THOUGHT WAS RIGHT,
BUT THEY SPENT FAR MORE INK
DWELLING
ON MY MISHANDLING
OF THE VICE-PRESIDENTIAL
SELECTION
THAN WAS EVER DEVOTED
TO THE WATERGATE BREAK-IN
ON THE PART
OF THE NIXON PEOPLE
DURING THE CAMPAIGN.
IT WAS HARD TO GET
THEM INTERESTED IN THAT.
Depp:
"AT THE STROKE
OF MIDNIGHT IN WASHINGTON
A DROOLING RED-EYED BEAST
WITH THE LEGS OF A MAN
AND THE HEAD
OF A GIANT HYENA
CRAWLS OUT
OF ITS BEDROOM WINDOW
IN THE SOUTH WING
OF THE WHITE HOUSE
AND LEAPS 50'
DOWN TO THE LAWN,
PAUSES BRIEFLY TO STRANGLE
THE CHOW WATCHDOG,
THEN RACES OFF
INTO THE DARKNESS
TOWARDS THE WATERGATE,
SNARLING WITH LUST,
LOPING THROUGH THE ALLEYS
BEHIND PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
AND TRYING DESPERATELY
TO REMEMBER
WHICH ONE OF THOSE
400 IDENTICAL BALCONIES
IS THE ONE OUTSIDE
MARTHA MITCHELL'S APARTMENT."
( growling )
Depp:
"DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES
BEYOND MY CONTROL,
I WOULD RATHER
NOT WRITE ANYTHING
ABOUT THE 1972
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
AT THIS TIME.
ON TUESDAY,
NOVEMBER 7TH,
I WILL GET OUT
OF BED LONG ENOUGH
TO GO DOWN
TO THE POLLING PLACE
AND VOTE
FOR GEORGE McGOVERN.
AFTERWARDS, I WILL
DRIVE BACK TO THE HOUSE,
LOCK THE FRONT DOOR,
GET BACK IN BED
AND WATCH TELEVISION
AS LONG AS NECESSARY.
IT WILL PROBABLY
BE A WHILE BEFORE
THE ANGST LIFTS.
BUT WHENEVER IT HAPPENS,
I WILL GET OUT
OF BED AGAIN
AND START WRITING THE MEAN,
COLD-BLOODED BUMMER
THAT I WAS NOT
QUITE READY FOR TODAY."
Crouse:
HE WAS THE RIGHT MAN
IN THE RIGHT PLACE
AND HE WAS EQUIPPED
TO CAPTURE
A CERTAIN MOMENT
IN HISTORY
AS NOBODY ELSE WAS
EQUIPPED TO DO.
IN HIS BEST PAGES,
I THINK HE CAPTURED
CERTAIN TRUTHS
ABOUT HUMAN PERVERSITY
THAT WILL NEVER LOSE
THEIR STING.
AND I DON'T THINK
THAT ANYBODY CAN BE
TOO SURPRISED
THAT WE FIND OURSELVES
IN THE NIGHTMARE
WE'RE IN TODAY
BECAUSE IT'S
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME
AS THE NIGHTMARE
HE DESCRIBED BACK THEN.
AND I THINK
IT WILL ALWAYS BE SALUBRIOUS
AND CLEANSING
TO HAVE SOMEONE EXPRESS
THE MOCKERY
AND THE RAGE
AND FINALLY THE DESPAIR
THAT ARE THE ONLY REACTION
OF A REAL HUMAN
TO THAT NIGHTMARE.
Reporter:
Massachusetts has gone
for the Democratic candidate--
the only state
going for McGovern.
Reporter #2:
We project that
President Nixon
will come out
of this the winner.
with about 60% of the popular vote.
And somewhere between 450-500 or more election votes.
I've never known
a national election
when I would be able
to go to bed earlier
than tonight.
( audience laughs )
* PUT A CANDLE
IN THE WINDOW... *
Crouse:
"THIS MAY BE THE YEAR
WHEN WE FINALLY COME
FACE TO FACE
WITH OURSELVES,
FINALLY JUST LAY BACK
AND SAY
THAT WE ARE
REALLY JUST A NATION
OF 220 MILLION
USED-CAR SALESMEN
WITH ALL THE MONEY
WE NEED TO BUY GUNS
AND NO QUALMS
AT ALL ABOUT KILLING
ANYBODY ELSE IN THE WORLD
WHO TRIES TO MAKE US
UNCOMFORTABLE."
McGovern:
NEVER AGAIN WILL WE SEND
THE PRECIOUS YOUNG BLOOD
OF THIS COUNTRY
TO DIE TRYING
TO PROP UP
A CORRUPT MILITARY
DICTATORSHIP ABROAD.
( crowd cheers )
"THE TRAGEDY OF ALL THIS IS
THAT GEORGE McGOVERN,
FOR ALL HIS MISTAKES
AND ALL HIS IMPRECISE TALK
ABOUT NEW POLITICS
AND HONESTY
IN GOVERNMENT,
IS ONE OF THE FEW MEN
WHO WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES
IN THIS CENTURY
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT A FANTASTIC MONUMENT
THIS COUNTRY
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
IF WE COULD'VE KEPT IT
OUT OF THE HANDS
OF GREEDY LITTLE HUSTLERS
LIKE RICHARD NIXON."
* GUESS I'VE GOT
THAT OLD TRAVELING BONE *
* GONNA FEEL
REALLY ALONE... *
...WHETHER OR NOT
THEIR PRESIDENT IS A CROOK.
WELL, I'M NOT A CROOK.
* BUT I WON'T-- I WON'T BE
LOSING MY WAY, NO NO... *
Crouse:
"McGOVERN MADE
SOME STUPID MISTAKES,
BUT, IN CONTEXT,
THEY SEEM ALMOST FRIVOLOUS
COMPARED TO THE THINGS
RICHARD NIXON DOES
EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE
ON PURPOSE
AS A MATTER OF POLICY
AND A PERFECT EXPRESSION
OF EVERYTHING HE STANDS FOR.
JESUS, WHERE WILL IT END?
HOW LOW DO YOU HAVE TO STOOP
IN THIS COUNTRY
TO BE PRESIDENT?"
* PUT A CANDLE
IN THE WINDOW *
* THOUGH I'M GOING,
GOING *
* I'LL BE
COMING HOME SOON *
* LONG AS I CAN SEE
THE LIGHT... *
WHEW.
Wenner:
AS MUCH AS HE WAS
REVILED AND REVULSED
BY NIXON,
HE IDENTIFIED WITH HIM.
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT DARKNESS
OF THE AMERICAN SPIRIT.
YOU KNOW, HUNTER WAS
DEEPLY INVESTED IN AMERICA.
WHETHER YOU CALL IT
THE AMERICAN DREAM
OR AMERICAN POLITICS,
ALL THE THINGS
HE WROTE ABOUT
WERE ALWAYS
LOOKING AT THE DARK SIDE
AS WELL AS THE HOPE.
BUT DURING HIS LIFETIME
IT KEPT LOOKING LIKE,
ONCE AGAIN, THE EVIL,
THE DARKNESS WOULD TRIUMPH.
Crouse:
IN 1972, HE BEGAN
TO FEEL DISILLUSIONED.
AND WITH JIMMY CARTER,
HE WAS TRYING
TO GIVE POLITICS
ONE LAST CHANCE.
( "Georgia on my Mind"
playing )
Depp:
"I HAVE HEARD
HUNDREDS OF SPEECHES
BY ALL KINDS OF CANDIDATES
AND POLITICIANS,
BUT I HAVE NEVER HEARD
A SUSTAINED PIECE
OF POLITICAL ORATORY
THAT IMPRESSED ME MORE
THAN THE SPEECH
JIMMY CARTER MADE
ON LAW DAY
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF GEORGIA
ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON
IN MAY, 1974.
IT WAS A KING HELL BASTARD
OF A SPEECH.
BY THE TIME IT WAS OVER,
IT HAD RUNG EVERY BELL
IN THE ROOM."
Carter: Senator Kennedy
and distinguished
fellow Georgians,
friends of the Law School
of Georgia and--
Hunter: I WAS
THE ONLY REPORTER THERE
AND I WAS WITH KENNEDY.
I HAD NO INTEREST
IN CARTER
AND NO INTENTION
OF EITHER LISTENING TO HIM
OR REPORTING
ANYTHING HE SAID.
Carter:
NOT PAYING
ANY ATTENTION TO ME,
HE WAS GOING OUTSIDE
EVERY NOW AND THEN
TO REPLENISH
HIS GLASS OF WHAT WAS
APPARENTLY ICE TEA
BUT WAS REALLY
WILD TURKEY WHISKEY.
I STARTED SPEAKING
FROM MY HEART
ABOUT THE DEFECTS
IN THE AMERICAN
JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
( Carter speaking )
Depp:
"BUT WHAT SENT ME
BACK OUT TO THE TRUNK
TO GET MY TAPE RECORDER
INSTEAD OF ANOTHER DRINK
WAS THE SPECTACLE
OF A SOUTHERN POLITICIAN
TELLING A CROWD
OF JUDGES AND LAWYERS
THAT 'THE SOURCE
OF MY UNDERSTANDING
ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT
AND WRONG IN THIS SOCIETY
IS FROM A FRIEND
OF MINE--
A GREAT POET
NAMED BOB DYLAN.'"
( Carter speaking )
* I AIN'T GONNA WORK ON
MAGGIE'S FARM NO MORE... *
- ( crowd laughs )
- Carter: SHE SAID...
Hunter:
"AT THIS POINT,
CARTER WAS ATTACKED
BY WHAT WAS LATER IDENTIFIED
AS A 48 LB SLOPE."
( Carter speaking )
Carter:
I WAS SPEAKING
TO A BUNCH OF LAWYERS
AND THE REACTION
AMONG THEM WAS ONE
OF STUNNED SILENCE.
( silence )
( Carter speaking )
"...HE WAS GREETED
WITH HORROR.
STILL, ONCE THAT
CHANGE WAS MADE--
A VERY SIMPLE,
DIFFICULT CHANGE--
NO ONE IN HIS RIGHT MIND
WOULD WANT TO GO BACK
TO CIRCUMSTANCES PRIOR
TO THAT JUNCTURE
IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF OUR NATION'S SOCIETY."
IT CHANGED MY LIFE.
OF COURSE, HUNTER IS THE PERSON
THAT FOUND JIMMY CARTER.
HUNTER WOULD GO
AROUND THE COUNTRY
AND PLAY IT FOR PEOPLE.
Brinkley:
HIS COVER STORY
ON "ROLLING STONE"
THAT HUNTER WROTE
ENDORSING CARTER
HELPED JIMMY CARTER
WIN THAT ELECTION.
HE WAS THE MOST POPULAR WRITER
IN THE UNITED STATES.
My next guest is one
of the most controversial
writers in America
and the inventor
of gonzo journalism.
We're delighted that
he could be with us tonight.
Welcome, please,
Dr. Hunter Thompson.
- ( applause )
- Brinkley: HE HAD JUST
DELIVERED "HELL'S ANGELS"
"VEGAS,"
"CAMPAIGN TRAIL,"
AND ALL THOSE GREAT
"ROLLING STONE" PIECES.
PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE THIS GUY WAS GONNA
STOP AT THAT POINT.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER
HE WOULD HAVE 30 YEARS
OF THIS KIND OF PRODUCTIVITY.
HE WAS--
HE WAS SO HOT.
HE'D GIVE A SPEECH
AT A COLLEGE
AND 20 WOMEN
WANTED TO PARTY
WITH HIM ALL NIGHT.
CLASSIC ROCK 'N' ROLL
ATTITUDE.
AND HUNTER SAW
ROCK STARS,
AND HE THOUGHT,
"WHY SHOULDN'T A WRITER
BE A ROCK STAR?"
HE BECAME
THAT ROCK 'N' ROLL--
TRASH THE HOTEL ROOM,
THROW THE TYPEWRITER
OUT THE WINDOW,
LET THE WOMEN IN,
TOO MUCH DRUGS--
MEANWHILE, THERE WAS
THIS OTHER SIDE OF HIM.
HE WAS THE SQUIRE
OF WOODY CREEK,
WHO HAD
A WIFE AND A KID.
( "Devil or Angel"
playing )
* DEVIL OR ANGEL
* I CAN'T MAKE UP
MY MIND *
* WHICH ONE YOU ARE
* I'D LIKE
TO WAKE UP AND FIND *
* DEVIL OR ANGEL
* DEAR, WHEREVER YOU ARE
* I MISS YOU,
I MISS YOU... *
Wright:
HERE WAS ALL THIS FAME,
ALL THESE FAMOUS PEOPLE,
ALL THESE
HANGER-ON GIRLS
AND PEOPLE COMING
INTO MY KITCHEN
WITH HEELS LIKE THIS.
WE LIVED OUT
IN WOODY CREEK--
AND IN TIGHT JEANS
AND STILETTOS
AND EVERYTHING GORGEOUS.
AND I SAID,
"WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING
IN MY WORLD?"
Juan:
YOU DON'T THINK HOW
IT SHOULD BE DIFFERENT.
YOU JUST ACCEPT
THAT MY DAD GETS UP
AT 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON
FOR THE 5:00 NEWS.
HE EATS BREAKFAST,
I EAT DINNER.
IT'S A SHAME
HE WASN'T AROUND MORE,
BUT THAT'S WHO HE WAS.
I MET HUNTER
IN JOHN BELUSHI'S
DRESSING ROOM
AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."
HE WAS
THE ULTIMATE BAD BOY,
BUT WE BECAME
FANTASTIC FRIENDS.
AND ONE NIGHT
HE WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE
AND I GUESS BY THE WAY
HE WAS TALKING TO THEM--
WHEN HE HUNG UP I SAID,
"OH, WHO WAS THAT?"
AND HE SAID,
"WELL, THAT'S SONDI."
I SAID, "WELL, WHO'S SONDI?"
HE SAID, "MY WIFE,"
AND I SAID,
"YOUR WIFE?"
Brinkley:
MEANWHILE, HIS MARRIAGE
WAS GETTING VERY ROCKY,
HE WAS STARTING TO DRINK
AND DO TOO MANY DRUGS
AND FELL INTO FAME.
Caddell:
WHAT HAD GIVEN HIM
HIS STRENGTH--
HIS ANONYMITY-- WAS GONE.
BY WRITING AND BECOMING
THE POLITICAL REPORTER HE WAS,
HE HAD LOST THAT ANONYMITY
THAT HAD BEEN HIS CLOAK.
SO NOW HE WAS THE STORY.
I USED TO BE ABLE
TO STAND IN THE BACK
AND OBSERVE STORIES
AND ABSORB THEM.
NOW THE MINUTE
I APPEAR AT A STORY,
THEN I BECOME
PART OF IT.
FIRST TIME I WENT
TO A PRESS CONFERENCE
WITH JIMMY CARTER
I HAD TO SIGN
MORE AUTOGRAPHS
THAN CARTER SIGNED.
AND THE SECRET SERVICE HAD
NO IDEA WHO I WAS.
THEY THOUGHT I WAS
AN ASTRONAUT.
Wenner:
AT THAT POINT,
YOU KNOW, IT WAS HARD.
HOW DO YOU FIND STUFF
FOR HUNTER TO DO?
YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING
FOR A STORY THAT SOMEHOW
CAN TOP THE CAMPAIGN STORY
OR VEGAS,
SOMETHING BIG ENOUGH
FOR HIS TALENT.
GOING TO ZAIRE SEEMED
LIKE A NATURAL ASSIGNMENT
FOR HUNTER,
A BIG SPECTACLE,
HEAVYWEIGHT FIGHT;
ALI, WHOM HE KNEW
OR HAD WRITTEN ABOUT BEFORE.
HE WENT.
STEADMAN CAME DOWN
FROM LONDON.
I'M GONNA RETIRE
THE HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION
OF THE WORLD!
SEPTEMBER THE 25th,
THE WORLD WILL BE STUNNED!
Brinkley:
HIS HERO, NUMBER ONE,
WAS MUHAMMAD ALI.
HE USED TO ALWAYS SAY
THAT HE WAS RELATED
TO CASSIUS CLAY
IN THE BLOODLINE.
I'VE NEVER
FULLY BELIEVED IT--
IT COULD BE TRUE--
BUT HE LOVED TO SAY
THAT HE WAS BLOOD-RELATED
TO MUHAMMAD ALI.
HAH! SUCKER,
YOU AIN'T NOTHING.
YOU'RE TOO UGLY TO REPRESENT
US COLORED FOLKS.
Brinkley:
AND REMEMBER AGAIN,
MUHAMMAD ALI IS
THIS TOUCHSTONE
FOR HUNTER,
THAT THE KENTUCKY BOYS
ARE MAKING IT BIG.
- ( grunts )
YOU OUT, SUCKER.
- ( men chuckle )
Wolfe:
HE WENT TO ZAIRE TO COVER
THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE.
IT WAS
THE FOREGONE CONCLUSION
THAT GEORGE FOREMAN WAS
GOING TO KNOCK OUT
MUHAMMAD ALI.
THERE SEEMED TO BE NO WAY
THAT ALI COULD SURVIVE
THAT FIGHT.
( Hunter speaks )
( Steadman speaks )
( Hunter speaking )
( Hunter speaking )
( Hunter speaking )
( inhaling deeply )
HE STOPS, AND HE LOOKS UP
AT THE DRUG DEALER
AND HE SAYS...
( Hunter yelling )
( yelling )
YOU KNOW, AND IT GOT WORSE
AND WORSE AND WORSE AND WORSE.
( Hunter yelling )
THIS WAS WHEN HUNTER GAVE
OUR TICKETS AWAY.
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT I DID.
I JUST THINK
I TRIED TO WATCH IT
ON TELEVISION OR SOMETHING
SO I WOULD GET
SOME IDEA OF IT,
BUT HUNTER HAD GONE
DOWN TO THE POOL
WITH A BUCKET OF ICE
AND A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY,
DRINKING AND SMOKES--
HIS DUNHILLS.
AND HUNTER DECIDED TO...
TAKE A DIP IN THE POOL,
FLOAT IN THE POOL
AT THE HOTEL
THROUGHOUT
THE ENTIRE FIGHT.
( Hunter whoops )
Announcer:
30 seconds left
in round eight.
AS IT TURNED OUT,
IT WAS ONE OF THE...
CLASSIC FIGHTS
OF ALL TIME.
Announcer:
Another sneaky right hand.
This time he worked
over his shoulder.
Unbelievable!
( cheering )
( Hunter speaks )
Referee:
Four, five, six, seven--
( announcer yelling )
( Hunter speaks )
THIS WAS CALLED
THE BIGGEST FUCKED-UP
JOURNALISTIC STORY
IN THE HISTORY
OF JOURNALISM--
THAT WE REALLY DIDN'T
GET A STORY.
Wenner: ZAIRE WAS
HUNTER'S FIRST BIG FAILURE
AS AN ASSIGNMENT.
THERE WAS A BIG EXPENSE BILL--
WHICH I PAID FOR--
AND DIDN'T DO THE PIECE,
AND THAT WAS DISAPPOINTING
TO US ALL.
I THINK HUNTER FELT
A STRONG SENSE OF FAILURE.
THAT WAS KIND OF THE BEGINNING
OF A PERIOD OF DECLINE THERE.
HE, AS A WRITER,
A JOURNALIST AND A PERSON,
RAN UP AGAINST
SOME WALL THERE
OR A PERIOD THERE,
WHETHER IT WAS
COMING FROM EXHAUSTION
OR SOMETHING GOING
ON WITH HIS MARRIAGE--
SOMEWHERE HE JUST LOST IT.
Wright:
HUNTER CAME BACK
FROM AFRICA,
HE DIDN'T WAKE UP
FOR A DAY AND A HALF.
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
HE JUST COULDN'T WRITE.
HE COULDN'T PIECE
IT TOGETHER.
HIS LIFE REALLY CHANGED
AFTER THAT
AND HE KNEW THAT
HE WASN'T THE WRITER
THAT HE WANTED TO BE.
- ( chatting )
- * MAN...
* YOU KNOW
I DONE ENJOYED THINGS *
* THAT KINGS AND QUEENS
WILL NEVER HAVE... *
Wenner:
HE STOPPED WRITING FULL-TIME
IN THE MID-'70s,
THEN HE'D JUST DO
THE ARTICLES.
PART OF WHAT HAPPENED
WAS I THINK
THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE
HANGING AROUND WOODY CREEK,
AND HE WAS VERY WELCOMING
AND ENJOYED IT ALL,
BUT IT REALLY MADE IT
DIFFICULT TO WORK.
"...SAFE FOR MY YOUNG SON."
( all laughing )
"BUT THE FRONT DOORS ARE
A DIFFERENT MATTER."
Brinkley: I WAS
A BIT OF A STRAIGHT MAN
ENTERING HIS CARNIVAL LIFE.
HE USED TO CALL
HIMSELF A DRUG-ADDLED
COMPOUND JUNKIE.
* AND GOOD TIMES, MMM
* I HAVE HAD MY FUN...
Stranahan:
I'D GO AROUND
TO TAKE CARE OF HUNTER.
IF HE CAN TOSS
THE HEINEKEN BOTTLE
AND CATCH IT,
HE HASN'T HAD
TOO MUCH TO DRINK.
AND HE BEGAN TO RETREAT
TO OWL FARM MORE AND MORE.
Juan:
THEN EVENTUALLY HE DIDN'T
REALLY GO OUT AT ALL.
I GUESS PEOPLE
CAME TO HIM.
Wenner:
HE WAS WRITING
OCCASIONAL COLUMNS
FOR THE "EXAMINER"
AND HE DID THAT "LONO" BOOK.
THEY WERE ALL RIGHT.
BUT HE WROTE
THREE PIECES,
JUST-- THEY WERE
JUST BRILLIANT.
ELKO, PULITZER, "POLO"--
THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL,
BUT HIS WORK NEVER GOT
QUITE BACK TO THOSE LEVELS.
IT WAS
ALL JUST REPETITIVE,
NOT FUNNY
GOOFBALL STUFF.
HUNTER WANTED A PERSONA,
BUT HE BECAME A HOSTAGE
TO THAT PERSONA
AS HE GOT OLDER AND OLDER
AND HE WAS BEING RIDICULED
AS A COMIC-BOOK CHARACTER.
WHEN GARRY TRUDEAU
FIRST MADE DUKE
A CHARACTER
IN DOONESBURY
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY,
LITERALLY,
THE RAOUL DUKE CHARACTER
THAT HUNTER INVENTED.
IT WAS HUNTER'S
LITERARY PROPERTY.
SO I THINK HE SHOULD'VE--
HE COULD HAVE AND--
IN RETROSPECT--
SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THAT.
BUT THEN HE SAID,
"WHAT CAN I DO?
I DECIDED TO OWN IT.
THEY WANT TO SEE UNCLE DUKE?
I'LL GIVE 'EM UNCLE DUKE
TIMES FIVE."
- WOW.
- Man: YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
Caddell:
HE HATED "DOONESBURY."
HE HATED BEING A CARICATURE.
HE ALSO LOVED
BEING A STAR,
BUT ALSO IT INTERFERED
WITH HIM BEING A REPORTER,
WHICH IS WHAT
HE WANTED TO BE.
Hunter:
IF YOU WANT TO BE
A FAMOUS AMERICAN WRITER,
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK OF...
BEING IN THE COMIC STRIPS,
- YOU KNOW, BEING--
- ( ice clatters )
OH, ARE WE DOING THINGS
LIKE THAT?
YES, IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
AND IT WILL BE ON FILM,
WON'T IT? MMM.
HUNTER DID BECOME,
IN A WAY, A PRISONER
OF HIS OWN FAME.
Wright:
I WAS GETTING MORE
DISTRAUGHT WITH HIS FAME.
IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS
IN THE HOUSE.
JUST THOUGHTS
OF BOOZE, DRUGS,
STAYING UP FOR DAYS
AND PARTIES.
AND LITTLE DID I KNOW
HE WAS HAVING AFFAIRS
ALL OVER THE PLACE.
IT WAS UNHEALTHY FOR ME,
IT WAS UNHEALTHY FOR MY SON.
Brinkley:
EVENTUALLY SONDI
UNCOVERED A TAPE
OF A WOMAN
THAT HE WAS WITH.
Woman:
I'm gonna burn up
with unfulfilled desire
if I have to stay here
one more minute alone.
( Hunter speaks )
No, I don't want
the delivery boy.
I want you.
( woman giggles )
Wright:
SO I REMEMBER SITTING
ON THE PHONE,
I LOOKED UP AT HIM
AND I SAID,
"YOU KNOW I CAN'T
DO THIS ANYMORE.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
HAVE A DIVORCE."
WELL...
( mimics explosion )
HE JUST BLEW UP
AND THEN I GOT SCARED
AND I ENDED UP
CALLING THE SHERIFF.
AND A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY
COMES OUT TO THE HOUSE.
THE GUYS SAYS...
"UM, DOES HE HAVE
ANY GUNS?"
AND I SAID,
"'DOES HE HAVE ANY GUNS?'
HE HAS 22 GUNS
AND EVERY ONE
IS LOADED."
- ( gunshot )
- Woman: HEY!
( mumbles )
Brinkley:
IT WAS NOT AN EASY DIVORCE
FOR HUNTER.
HE REFUSED
TO LEAVE OWL FARM.
SANDY SAID, "THE ONLY THING
HE OWNS IS THIS LAND.
I HAVE TO HAVE HALF
OF WHAT HUNTER OWNS,
'CAUSE I'M DIVORCING HIM.
AND I DON'T WANT
HALF THE LAND
BECAUSE I HAVE TO LIVE
NEXT TO THE SON OF A BITCH."
SO I GOT TO BUY
MY LAND BACK.
WELL, I'D GIVEN IT
TO HUNTER.
SO THEN I ENDED UP
MAKING PAYMENTS TO SONDI
FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.
BUZZ OFF!
I'M GOING TO FLORIDA.
Brinkley:
HE COULDN'T WRITE.
HE WAS
COMPLETELY SHATTERED
AND JIMMY BUFFET CAME
TO HIS RESCUE
AND ALLOWED HIM
TO COME DOWN
AND STAY AT HIS HOUSE
IN KEY WEST FREE OF CHARGE.
* WASTING AWAY AGAIN
IN MARGARITAVILLE... *
THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.
* SEARCHING FOR MY
LOST SUGAR AND SALT... *
Hunter:
YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE
DRIVE SO FUCKING SLOWLY.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.
YOU DIRTY SONS OF BITCHES.
MOVE OVER. GO GET
IN THE FAST LANE,
YOU COCKSUCKERS.
Buffet:
THE FIRST THING I SEE IS
"GONZO JOURNALIST
COMES TO KEY WEST,"
FRONT PAGE,
FUCKING "MIAMI HERALD."
HUNTER'S STRETCHED OUT
IN MY APARTMENT.
AND THEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN, I GOT A CALL
FROM MY ACCOUNTANT.
HE SAID, "WHAT'S THIS
$9,000 TELEPHONE BILL?"
AND I WENT...
"OH MY GOD,
HUNTER'S DOWN THERE
AND I LEFT THE PHONE ON."
AND LIKE ALWAYS...
THEN HE GOT A BOAT
AND I THOUGHT, "OH, JESUS."
YOU KNOW, I EXPECTED
TO READ THE OBITUARY
DURING THOSE DAYS.
* IF I HAD A BOAT,
I'D GO OUT ON THE OCEAN *
* AND IF I HAD A PONY
* I'D RIDE HIM
ON MY BOAT *
* AND WE COULD
ALL TOGETHER *
* GO OUT ON THE OCEAN
* I SAID ME UPON MY PONY
ON MY BOAT *
* I SAID
ME UPON MY PONY *
* ON MY BOAT.
Anita on tape:
Say hello to the dolphins.
Well, hello.
Okay.
Anita:
WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I MET HUNTER,
IT WAS JUST KIND OF A--
BIG WRITER THAT I WAS
CURIOUS ABOUT.
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
HE PROMISED ME 10 YEARS.
I JUST FIGURED HE WAS
SUCH A POWERFUL FORCE
THAT HE WOULD KNOW.
IF HE SAID 10 YEARS,
THAT MEANT 10 YEARS.
HE HAD TALKED
ABOUT SUICIDE A LOT
SINCE I'VE KNOWN HIM,
AND NOW I KNOW,
TALKING TO HIS FORMER WIFE
AND OTHER GIRLFRIENDS,
THAT HE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.
Depp:
"TROUBLE CAN COME AT YOU
FROM ANY DIRECTION
THESE DAYS,
LIKE BEING CHASED THROUGH
A CROWDED PARKING LOT
BY A PACK
OF VICIOUS STRAY DOGS.
THE WORLD'S SITUATION HAS
BECOME SO NERVOUS AND WRONG
THAT DISASTERS THAT
WOULD'VE BEEN INCONCEIVABLE
TWO YEARS AGO ARE
ALMOST COMMONPLACE TODAY."
Anita:
I DID START
TO WORRY ABOUT HIM
RIGHT AFTER
THE BUSH ELECTION.
THAT I THINK
WAS THE TRIGGER.
HE DIDN'T GET ANGRY,
HE JUST GOT DEPRESSED.
YOU KNOW, I COULD HANDLE
WHEN HE WAS ANGRY,
FEISTY OR SULKY--
ANYTHING BUT DEPRESSED
OR SOMETHING I WASN'T USED TO.
* Goodbye,
Norma Jean... *
THERE ARE CERTAIN MOMENTS
THAT I'M REALLY GLAD
I HAD THE CAMERA.
THERE'S A MOMENT
I WALK OUT ONTO THE BALCONY--
HE HAD BEEN LISTENING
TO "CANDLE IN THE WIND"
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.
THERE WAS A LOOK
OF A GRIN,
LIKE A ROGUISH EYE
IN HIS EYE
WHEN HE WAS
ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN.
Whoo-hoo-hoo.
Anita:
SEEING HIM
LOOK AT THE KEYS--
ESPECIALLY TO MUSIC--
WHEN HE WAS HAVING FUN,
YOU COULD
SEE IT IN HIS FACE
AND ALSO ON THE PAGE.
* I would have liked
to have known you *
* Oh, but I was
just a kid *
* Your candle burned out
long before... *
( both laughing )
- * Your legend ever did.
- I feel wet.
Anita on tape:
Uh-oh. Good.
WHEN HE DID DIE, HIS WORDS
TOOK ON A NEW SPARKLE,
MAYBE BECAUSE
THEY ARE FINITE NOW.
WE HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT.
AND JUST THE FACT
THAT WE HAVE THE WORDS
IS A LUCKY THING.
I MEAN, IMAGINE IN
A TWISTED UNIVERSE
WHEN HE DIED
IF SOMEHOW HE TOOK
HIS WORDS WITH HIM,
HIS WORK.
- ( grapefruit thuds )
- Anita: OH, COME ON, HUNTER.
- THAT WAS NOT COOL AT ALL.
- I WAS TOSSING IT TO YOU.
- NO, YOU WEREN'T.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I DIDN'T HIT HIM
IN THE HEAD LIKE THAT.
- Anita: THAT'S ENOUGH.
Wolfe:
TO FEEL COMPELLED
TO BE GONZO ALL THE TIME
MUST HAVE BEEN A BURDEN
ON HIS POOR MIND.
HE WAS SO IDENTIFIED
WITH THE LIFE HE'S DESCRIBED,
IT WAS HARD FOR HIM
NOT TO BE IN COSTUME,
NOT TO BE THE ACTOR
THAT WAS REQUIRED.
HUNTER MUST
HAVE FELT TRAPPED--
TRAPPED IN GONZO.
Hunter:
SO, I'M REALLY
IN THE WAY AS A PERSON.
THE MYTH HAS TAKEN OVER
AND I FIND MYSELF,
YOU KNOW, AN APPENDAGE.
I'M...
I'M NO LONGER NECESSARY.
I'M IN THE WAY.
IT'D BE MUCH BETTER
IF I DIED,
THEN PEOPLE COULD TAKE
THE MYTH AND MAKE FILMS.
LIKE, WHEN I GO OUT TO--
WHEN I GOT INVITED TO SPEAK
AT, SAY, UNIVERSITIES,
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE
INVITING DUKE OR THOMPSON.
so I'm not sure
who to be--
SO I'M NOT SURE WHO TO BE.
I suppose that my plans
are to figure out
some new identity.
You know, I have
to kill off one life
and start another one--
KILL OFF ONE LIFE
AND START ANOTHER ONE.
( "Mr. Tambourine Man"
playing )
* HEY, MR. TAMBOURINE MAN,
PLAY A SONG FOR ME *
- * I'M NOT SLEEPY... *
- ( gunshot )
* AND THERE IS
NO PLACE I'M GOING TO... *
Juan:
IT WAS NO SECRET THAT
THAT'S THE WAY
HE WOULD DIE.
HE'D MADE THAT CLEAR
MANY YEARS BEFORE,
THAT WHEN THE TIME CAME,
HE WAS GONNA--
HE WAS GONNA
TAKE HIMSELF OUT
AND IT WOULD BE
WITH A GUN.
SO THAT--
THAT WAS NO SURPRISE.
BUT IT'S ONE THING
TO KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT,
YOU KNOW,
HE WAS GONNA KILL HIMSELF
AND IT'S ANOTHER
WHEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENS.
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM
THAT WE WERE THERE.
IT WAS A SUNNY AFTERNOON
IN THE WINTER
AND IT WAS JUST
A VERY PEACEFUL TIME.
HIS FAMILY WAS THERE
AND HE DECIDED
"ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
A GOOD TIME TO GO OUT."
IT SOUNDS KIND OF SAPPY,
BUT IT WAS
A WARM FAMILY MOMENT.
* I'M READY
TO GO ANYWHERE *
* I'M READY FOR TO FADE... *
Steadman:
WHEN HE DID IT,
JUAN WAS IN THE NEXT ROOM
AND HE SAID,
"WHEN IT HAPPENED
I THOUGHT
I HEARD A BOOK DROP."
( book thuds )
IT WENT LIKE THAT.
JUAN WENT OUTSIDE
WITH A GUN
AND SHOT THREE TIMES
INTO THE AIR.
( three gunshots )
Steadman:
IT WAS A KIND OF
SALUTE TO HIM
AS MUCH AS ANYTHING--
OR SHOCK.
Wright:
HUNTER WAS VERY MUCH
ABOUT PRESERVING A LEGACY,
AND THIS WAS PERFECT.
THIS WAS ROMANTIC.
AND IN A LOT
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS,
IT WAS A VERY STRONG ACT.
IT WAS A NOBLE ACT.
"GO OUT WHEN
YOU'RE ON TOP."
HE WASN'T ON TOP.
HE WAS NOWHERE
NEAR ON TOP.
BUT SOME PEOPLE
THOUGHT THAT,
AND SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT
IT WAS A VERY COURAGEOUS ACT.
I THINK
JUST THE OPPOSITE.
I THINK THIS IS A TIME
WHEN A TOGETHER
HUNTER THOMPSON
COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
* I WOULDN'T
PAY IT ANY MIND *
* IT'S JUST A SHADOW
YOU'RE SEEING *
* THAT HE'S CHASING... *
Buffet:
IT'S A TRAGIC MISTAKE.
I WISH HE WAS STILL HERE.
I WISH THERE WAS STILL
A HUNTER AROUND TO TALK TO.
IT'S AN AMAZING THING.
YOU THINK ON ONE SIDE
IT'S FUN TO REMINISCE,
BUT ITS SAD THAT HE'S GONE.
WE COULD HAVE USED
A FEW MORE YEARS OF HUNTER.
HE COULD WIELD
A PRETTY EFFECTIVE SWORD
AGAINST WHAT'S
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
* I'LL COME
FOLLOWIN' YOU... *
( Wenner speaking )
YOU KNOW, JUST ALL OF IT.
JUST ALL OF IT.
HUNTER, NO!
YOU BASTARD!
- ( Hunter chuckles )
- FUCKHEAD!
- OH SHIT.
- Hunter: YOU'RE OKAY.
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.
( fire roars )
Buchanan:
HE FLAMED OUT TOO QUICKLY,
BECAUSE OF THE WAY
HE LIVED HIS LIFE
AND CHOSE
TO LIVE HIS LIFE.
SO IN MY VIEW IT WAS--
IT WAS SELF-INDULGENT.
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
HE WANTED TO DO,
BUT HE HAD SO MUCH MORE
HE COULD GIVE HIS READERS
AND HIS PEOPLE...
AND HIMSELF.
( motorcycle
roars loudly )
THAT'S FITTING.
THAT'S FITTING.
- Man: THAT'S FITTING
FOR HUNTER.
- A MOTORCYCLE...
- ( men laughing )
- ...ROARS OFF.
OKAY.
Steadman:
IT SEEMS WE'RE HERE
TODAY TO DISCUSS
SOME KIND IDEA
FOR A MONUMENT.
IF I SHOW YOU THIS--
THIS IS THE BASIC IDEA,
BUT ACTUALLY,
HUNTER HASN'T
APPROVED IT YET.
IT'S JUST
A THOUGHT, YEAH.
HE LIVES IN ASPEN
- IN COLORADO.
- Man: THAT IS DIFFERENT.
IS THIS SOMETHING
THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO DO
- IN THE NEAR FUTURE?
- Hunter: HE'S WRITTEN--
- I'M NOT SURE.
- I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING
THAT MAYBE YOU WANT
TO DO AFTER YOU DIE.
OH, YEAH,
IT'S IN THE WILL.
IT'S ALL DESCRIBED.
IT'S GONNA BE
A LITTLE HARD TO DO,
PARTICULARLY WITH ME GONE.
THIS RIM OF MOUNTAINS
IS A GIANT VALLEY
20 MILES ACROSS.
- IS THIS PROPERTY
THAT YOU OWN NOW?
- Hunter: YEAH.
THE PROPERTY GOES BACK
OVER THE CLIFFS,
SO I CAN DO WHATEVER--
IF I WANTED TO BUILD A...
McDONALD'S,
I COULD DO IT BACK THERE.
( "Spirit in the Sky"
playing )
Hunter:
IT'S GONNA BE A PILE
OF ROCKS ABOUT 100' TALL.
* WHEN I DIE
AND THEY LAY ME TO REST... *
A GIANT CONE-- CONICAL.
GOING AROUND
AND TAPERING DOWN
TO THE TOP.
ABOUT EVERY TWO YEARS,
THE DOCTOR TELLS ME
I'M GONNA DIE.
FOR ALL I KNOW,
SOMEHOW I MIGHT LIVE
FOR 10 MORE YEARS.
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING--
NONE OF US KNOW HOW LONG
WE'RE GONNA LIVE.
ON TOP OF THE BIG ARM,
A DOUBLE-- A FIST
WITH DOUBLE THUMBS--
THE SYMBOL.
I'VE TOLD YOU
1,000 TIMES FOR 10 YEARS--
YOU'VE GOT TO PUT
TWO THUMBS ON THE FIST.
Steadman:
IT'S BETTER THAN NO THUMB,
WHICH IS WHAT YOU HAD.
* SO YOU KNOW
THAT WHEN YOU DIE *
* HE'S GONNA RECOMMEND YOU *
* TO THE SPIRIT
IN THE SKY *
* GONNA RECOMMEND YOU
TO THE SPIRIT IN THE SKY *
* THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE
GONNA GO WHEN YOU DIE *
* WHEN YOU DIE AND THEY
LAY YOU TO REST... *
Hunter:
AFTER THE CREMATION, THEY PUT
THE ASHES IN A CANISTER
AND SHOOT IT OUT
OF THE TOP OF THE FIST
OVER THE VALLEY.
SAY 500' UP, IT EXPLODES
AND THE ASHES DRIFT OUT
ALL OVER THERE.
THAT I DO KNOW ABOUT.
WE PLACE ASHES IN
DIFFERENT AREAS.
I'M A FIRM BELIEVER
IN "ASHES TO ASHES,
AND DUST TO DUST."
( crowd cheers )
AND THAT'S IT.
THAT'S MY FUNERAL.
Man:
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR!
( "Lawyers, Guns and Money"
playing )
* I WENT HOME
WITH THE WAITRESS *
* THE WAY I ALWAYS DO
* HOW WAS I TO KNOW
* SHE WAS
WITH THE RUSSIANS TOO? *
* I WAS GAMBLING
IN HAVANA *
* I TOOK
A LITTLE RISK *
* SEND LAWYERS,
GUNS AND MONEY *
* DAD, GET ME OUT OF THIS
* HAH!
* I'M THE INNOCENT BYSTANDER *
* SOMEHOW I GOT STUCK
* BETWEEN THE ROCK
AND THE HARD PLACE *
* AND I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *
* YES, I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *
* WELL, I'M DOWN
ON MY LUCK *
