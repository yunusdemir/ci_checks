''The days of man are but as grass...
''...for he flourisheth
as the flower of the field.
''For as soon as the wind goes over it,
it is gone...
''...and the place thereof
shall know it no more.
''The merciful goodness of the Lord
endureth forever and ever...
''...upon them that fear Him...
''...even upon such as keep His covenant...
''...and think upon His commandments
and do them.
''The Lord hath prepared
his seat in Heaven...
''...and His kingdom ruleth over all.
''For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God...
''...in His great mercy to take upon Himself
the soul of our sister...
''...Catherine Earnshaw Linton...
''...we therefore commit her body
to the ground.
''Earth to earth.
''Ashes to ashes.
''Dust to dust.
''In sure and certain hope of the
resurrection to the eternal life...
''...through our Lord, Jesus Christ...
''...to change our vile body to be like...
''...unto His glorious body
according to the mighty working...
''...whereby He is able to subdue
all things unto Himself.''
It seemed a long while to us all...
...the waiting for Mr. Earnshaw
to return from Liverpool.
He was expected
by suppertime of the third day...
...but it was long after dark
and we had long since tired...
...of running down to the gate
to look for him...
...and were sitting wearily by the fire
with Mrs. Earnshaw...
...who would have had us all to bed...
...had we not begged
to be allowed to stay up...
...for the Master
had promised us all a present.
A fiddle for Hindley,
a riding whip for little Cathy...
...and some apples and pears for me
even though I was just the serving girl.
-Wake up. Your father's home.
-Dear Father, I was asleep.
-Father, did you get my fiddle?
-Let me be a minute. Hold on.
I feel as lf I've been torn to pieces.
-Did you get my fiddle?
-Did you get the whip?
-Patience.
-Did you get it?
Patience. Let him get his breath.
You'll see everything soon enough.
Two whole days I took coming here.
The roads were that bad.
Now this isn't exactly
what you've been expecting...
...but let's say it's a gift from God.
He looks more like a gift from the devil.
-I'll not have gypsies in my house.
-He's not a gypsy.
I don't care what it is, you get shot of it.
-What? And let him starve?
-Why not?
Plenty more do.
What's so special about him
that makes you so fine and tender?
Nothing. Except l found him in Liverpool...
-...without a soul to--
-And no doubt found more besides.
There's no need to drag your doings here.
-You're too clever for me by half.
-And you're not clever enough.
-What will you do? Make him work?
-Aye, but no more than others.
We lost a son, didn't we?
Well, thanks be to God, we have another.
He can be a brother to them.
I've no doubt he is already.
All right, get the lad washed and cleaned.
Take him to sleep with the others.
-What's his name?
-His name?
Call him Heathcliff, after our first son.
There's something of the same look
about him.
Get to bed.
But it's broken. He's broken it.
He's spoilt everything! Rotten little Gypo!
Just you mind your manners
and stop that face and get to bed.
-Why did he have to break it?
-He didn't break it.
Now, get to bed.
''For what we have received this day
may the Lord God of Hosts...
''...creator of Heaven and Hell...
''...before whose throne
all men tremble and look pale...
''...make us eternally grateful...
''...and may we rejoice in Thy bountiful
goodness forever, Lord.'' Amen.
Amen.
Come on, lad. I'm taking Heathcliff
with me to Gimmerton.
We'll take the musket and see
if we can't find some game on the way.
-Can I come?
-Maybe.
You can bring me in
some more turnips tonight.
Aye, Mistress.
Child, not so much noise.
Why don't you go with them?
But you....
What is it? What's the matter?
What's the matter?
My love....
Whatever happens....
I know that nothing's going to, but...
...l want you to remember:
You're the son of this house.
Everything must come to you.
The land, everything.
-Mother don't....
-It's all got to come to you, not....
There's no need
to talk that way to the boy.
Neither of us is dead yet.
Promise me that our son
shall have what is his.
You promise me you'll prefer no other.
Never fear Mary, the Lord watches over us.
Hindley shall get what is due to him.
Maybe more besides.
Come on, lad.
Come on.
Despite Cathy's increasing affection
for Heathcliff...
...I could see from the start that
his presence bred ill-feeling in the family.
Less that two years
after his arrival at Wuthering Heights...
...Mrs. Earnshaw died,
never having offered him a kindly word.
Hindley, in his loneliness after her death...
...had special cause to resent the Master's
strange affection for the child...
...and soon came to regard his father
more as an oppressor than as a friend.
-It's the lad I've come to see you about.
-Hindley?
What trouble has he been causing you?
Why, none. His progress
gives every cause for satisfaction.
Wish I could say the same for myself.
-Why are you always so....
-Hard on the lad?
Yes.
He gets no more than he deserves.
I think he deserves
rather more than he gets.
-He'll never amount to anything.
-He might, if you let him go to college.
College?
A man needs an education these days.
A man needs to be a man.
Go on, pour it out.
What's the cost
of this education nonsense?
50 or 60.
-What?
-A year, that is.
50 a year?
Only for a few years.
Itwon't be wasted, I can assure you.
It's a deal of hard-earned brass.
Even my lessons aren't free.
I don't begrudge you your few pennies,
but 50....
Say 60.
I'm sure if your dear wife were still alive
it's what she'd have wished.
Any more for York?
I, it seemed, was the only one
who regretted his departure.
Come on then, gee up. Come on.
But in the years that followed,
I took comfort in the fact...
...that the Master became less irritable
without Hindley there to provoke him.
In the course of time, however...
...failing health left him
an unhappy and peevish man.
The fire, girl.
Do you want me to freeze to death?
And so I tended the ailing master...
...while Cathy and Heathcliff, promising,
it seemed, to grow up rude as savages...
...became more reckless every day.
At this time they seemed
to need for nothing but each other...
...so deep and close was their friendship.
Why can't you always be a good lass?
Why can't you always be a good man,
Father?
l didn't mean it.
You mustn't be vexed.
''What, tho' my parents frown and scold
''Still Jockey l approve
''The youth is handsome, free and bold
''And pays me love for love
''And father at Jockey's age
''Did just the same as he
''My mother too, I dare engage
''Did just the same like me
''Did just the same like me''
Time for prayers, Master.
Go away upstairs.
Pray by thyselves tonight.
Goodnight, Father.
-What's the matter?
-Come now, don't fret.
Father?
What's the matter?
Father!
Leave him be, boy.
I've seen the carriage. It's Hindley.
Your ribbon's loose.
Yes?
You look very nice.
-Hello.
-Hello, Cathy.
This is Frances, my wife.
-I'm Cathy.
-I know.
This is Joseph, our chief hand.
And Nellie. She'll look after you.
When I'm dead...
...I think I'll come
and haunt you as a sunset.
No, perhaps not.
I think I'd prefer to be the wind
and the rain and beat you.
Itwas better before, wasn't it?
-Before what?
-Hindley.
You wouldn't ever leave here
without telling me, would you?
Do you remember this?
The Elf-stone. Remember how we swore
always to be together?
You mustn't ever leave me here.
-All right.
-Swear it.
No, seriously, swear it on the stone.
-l swear never to leave you.
-Or this place.
Or this place.
Unless you turn against me.
And l swear always to be your friend.
And to love no other as you
as long as l live.
May we both be buried alive...
...under the black rocks of Pennistone Crag
if we ever break this vow.
Kiss me.
From now on l want you to eat
in the kitchen.
-And Joseph.
-Yes, Master.
You can eat in the kitchen too.
And you can both of you sleep
in the rooms above.
-Above what?
-The barn.
My wife and l want the house to ourselves.
Three places are enough.
-Joseph!
-Yes, Master.
Now that I'm back, Heathcliff will have
to work if he wants to stay here.
Treat him as the others.
Work him as hard.
Right, Master.
No favors. Father's dead now.
Right. That's that then. Shall we eat?
I can see you.
Heathcliff?
It's no good hiding.
I can see you.
I can.
You rotten pig.
-Let's go to the Grange.
-Yes, let's.
Come on.
Play it yourself then.
Which must be very difficult
if you're tone-deaf.
Mamma!
Mamma! Come quickly.
Quick, come on.
Ruffians out in the grounds.
Quickly. Come on. Out.
They've gone round the back.
Get the dogs.
Where are they?
I'll give them a taste of this.
We've got 'em. A boy and a girl.
Attacking a magistrate's house
and on the Sabbath, too.
By God, they'll swing for this.
-Fasten the door Tom.
-lf she's hurt, you--
Come and see here. Don't be frightened.
-That's Miss Earnshaw.
-How can it be?
-Itis. She's from Wuthering Heights.
-I hope she's all right.
It's not our fault.
She shouldn't be here in the first place.
This must be the young lascar
Earnshaw brought back from Liverpool.
Shut your mouth or I'll rip your tongue out,
fat bastard.
-Get him out of here.
-I'm not leaving here without her.
-Thank you. A delightful sermon, as usual.
-Thank you.
-See you for dinner on Wednesday.
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much indeed.
-Good-bye.
Cathy would like to stay with us
a few days longer.
l take it you have no objection?
lf she's not too much of a burden,
Mrs. Linton.
On the contrary, we shall be delighted,
so would the children.
Frances tells me you worked wonders
with her in the past weeks.
Wait till you see her, Hindley.
Thanks to Mrs. Linton's devotion,
she has the manners of a lady.
And she will be treated as such
on her return.
I promise you, you'll have no
further need to reproach us.
-Cathy's back.
-Good. Tell the others.
Get Heathcliff.
Open the gate.
Cathy you look wonderful.
You do look nice.
What do you think?
Miss Cathy.
Come on in.
-They've got two dogs.
-Two!
At first they were so fierce,
but then they'd eat out of my hand.
-You really look beautiful.
-You'll get flour on it.
Let me do it.
Did you ever see such beautiful hair?
I know. Mrs. Linton did it for me.
-Do you like the dress?
-Beautiful.
-Where's Heathcliff?
-l sent for him. Heathcliff!
How dirty you look.
How grim.
You might at least smile
or have you forgotten me?
Come along Heathcliff,
smile and shake hands.
It's permitted on special occasions.
I didn't mean to laugh at you.
It's just that you look so dirty.
Come along. Shake hands. She's waiting.
Shake hands!
Hold him.
Right, you little bastard.
I've been waiting for this
for the past 10 years.
By God, you'll remember it.
All of a sudden l feel very hungry.
Did he hurt you that much?
Here. Let me see.
Let me see.
-He's hurt. We must do something.
-Go eat. Quick. They're waiting for you.
I can't.
Look, I'll look after him.
Go on, before there's more trouble.
I'm all right.
Let me wash those cuts
and put some oil on.
I'm going to get him.
I don't care how long it takes....
I'm gonna get him.
You mustn't talk like that. No.
What's done is done.
We must learn to forgive each other.
It's for God to punish the wicked.
Why should God have all the satisfaction?
Where's Nellie?
She's down yonder by the stream there.
What's the matter?
He's come.
It's a boy, and such a size on him.
How is he?
He's fine.
But the doctor says the missus must go.
Lord.
ls she very ill?
Doctor says she'll be dead before winter.
What?
Doctor says she'll be dead before winter.
Mr. Hindley says you're to look after it,
nurse and feed it.
-How's the baby?
-Soon be running about.
But I heard Dr. Kenneth says--
I don't give a damn what Dr. Kenneth says.
Frances is as right as rain.
She'll be up and about in a week or so.
I'll go and see to her.
I'll go up.
But get her to promise not to talk.
I mean I can't hold her still
and Kenneth says she must be quiet.
-l am sorry.
-I don't care a damn how sorry you are.
Be sure to look after him properly, Nellie.
Give him plenty of warm milk and sugar.
I'll love him like my own.
Now, you lie back.
And you're not to chatter
or the Master won't see you.
I promise l won't speak,
but it doesn't mean I can't laugh at him.
Poor Hindley. He makes such a fuss.
I've hardly said a word to him...
...and every time he's left me, he's cried.
Time for the Mistress to make her journey,
Master Hindley.
-Take no notice of them.
-Belle.
Hindley's just got to get
those dreadful people out of this house.
How can l invite anybody in here?
There's no decent folk who come here now.
Itmakes me feel so foolish at the Linton's.
Everybody knows what's going on in here.
Don't be so stupid, girl.
They didn't mean anything.
Don't touch me, or my father'll have
something to say to you.
Hindley, how could you?
He'll say naught if he wants to go on
working for me.
He may not care to and there's
many others that feels the same.
Why, you little....
Where the bloody hell do you think you're--
-Edgar is a very foolish young man.
-Mamma, really.
If you'd seen how he's been moping
the last few days.
-Isabella, you know that's just not true.
-Yes it is.
Nonsense.
And he hasn't eaten a thing.
l said to him the other day,
''Why don't you ride over there?''
But would he?
Mamma, really.
What will Catherine think of me?
What would you like me to think, Edgar?
-Where are you going?
-Nowhere.
Then what're you all dressed up for?
Itmay surprise you to know
some people not only wash every day...
...they dress like this all the time.
-You don't.
-Well, I do now.
-Are you going to Thrushcross Grange?
-Maybe. Maybe not.
But you spent nearly all last week there.
I never see you.
Well you can see me now.
You know what I mean.
-Don't go.
-Get your dirty hands off me.
Oh, you. You....
I'm not having any more trouble here.
Stop this fighting at once.
l won't have this behavior in my parish.
I know all of you and your captain.
You'll be flogged
if there's any more of this.
Come, sir.
-Can you keep a secret?
-lf it's worth keeping.
Edgar Linton has asked me to marry him.
-What did you say?
-l said yes.
l see.
-Do you love him?
-Of course I do.
Why do you love him?
l just do.
He loves me, too. And he's rich.
I shall have maids, servants.
I'll be the finest lady around here for miles.
lf Edgar loves you and you love Edgar,
you'll both be very happy.
l am happy now.
But....
But?
Here and here, I'm convinced I'm wrong.
What do you think?
I'm not thinking anything.
Yes, you are.
You're thinking, ''What about Heathcliff?''
-What about Heathcliff?
-I don't know.
I don't know.
Nobody could marry Heathcliff.
I mean, he's a wild animal.
It would be a disaster. I mean where
would we go? What would we do?
We'd be forced to live like beggars.
Itwould be....
Well, it would be degrading.
What is it?
What is it? What's the matter with you?
Itwas Heathcliff outside the door.
-Oh, God. You don't think he could....
-I don't know.
-Why didn't you tell me?
-l just saw....
Have you seen Heathcliff?
-lsn't he here?
-No!
Go on.
Do you think he's hiding somewhere?
lf he is he'll not be found
unless he wants to be.
We must find him.
He couldn't really have heard us, could he?
-What does it matter if he did?
-It's Heathcliff l love, not Edgar.
Don't you understand?
Then why....
Because it's the only chance I have
to get Heathcliff away from Hindley.
Then we'll both be free.
You don't mean you'd take Edgar's money?
Of course.
Why else do you think I'd marry Edgar?
I know he loves me,
and it will be very nice to be his wife.
And l love him, too, but differently.
I don't just love Heathcliff. l am Heathcliff.
All my thoughts, all my actions are for him.
He's my only reason for living.
You look like a drowned rat.
She's not ill, is she? I don't want
any more sickness in the house.
What were you doing outside all night?
Chasing after lads like usual.
You weren't with Heathcliff, were you?
I never saw him.
lf you were, he can pack his bags
and get the hell out of here.
-I never saw him.
-I don't care.
I'm sick and tired of him in this house.
I was going to get rid of him.
You'll never have that pleasure
because he's gone.
This is a very bad fever.
Keep the others away
and feed her on gruel, whey and water.
Will you be coming back?
We'll see.
Hey, you girl.
What?
Yes?
You'd best go to see to your young lady.
-What again?
-She's screaming fit to bust.
lf you can hear, why don't you go and see?
I'll not set foot in there.
That's woman's work.
Then try some of this.
The window stays shut.
All right, you can sit with me then.
l loathe being shut in like this.
Where is everybody?
Those that aren't drunk are working.
Why don't you come when I call you?
I've got enough to do without
running up and down stairs all day.
You leave the door open
and the one downstairs, too.
Just you lie still and think yourself
lucky enough to be alive.
All right, you let me die.
All right, girl, where is she? Upstairs?
-Yes, ma'am. But Dr. Kenneth said--
-Follow me Robert....
Fine thing when I have to learn about this
from the local ale-house.
Which way? Come along, girl.
-Why are the windows open?
-Why don't you ask her?
Why didn't you send word or something?
Ask her.
None of you should be here.
-Dr. Kenneth said that she--
-Hush!
Look, we're going to wrap you up warm,
take you back to the Grange...
...where we can look after you properly.
Edgar and Isabella will sit by you
until you're better.
Won't you Edgar?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Now we'd better get you dressed.
Go along, boy.
Yes.
You're very quiet.
What are you thinking about?
When I die, I shall be buried here...
...close to your mother and father.
He won't come back.
Not now.
l will try and make you happy.
Catherine.
You're away then.
I don't have to go to the Grange.
I could stay here and look after--
Don't you change anything for me, girl.
I'll be glad to see the back of you.
I never want to see another woman
in this house.
You'll be better off away from here,
the way things are.
Go on, get out.
Couldn't sleep.
What're you reading?
Just law books.
l feel there must be more
to being a magistrate...
...than just being born into the right family.
-Edgar?
-What is it?
Thank you.
Whatever for?
Everything.
ls it Heathcliff?
l thought he'd gone.
He has.
He has.
Joseph?
-You look well enough.
-l am.
l live here on my own now.
-Cathy?
-Married. Edgar.
Long?
A few months.
Must have thought
you weren't coming back.
How's your son?
Gone. Dead.
How did that happen?
He caught something.
Take your coat off. Sit down.
-Do you want a hand?
-Come on, sit down. She'll not run away.
-What are you playing?
-Brag.
Right. Whose deal?
Bless you.
-May l light the candles, ma'am?
-Certainly, Nellie.
Yes, Nellie?
There's a person from Gimmerton
to see you ma'am.
What do they want?
He wouldn't say.
Who is it, Nellie?
It's Heathcliff.
-Heathcliff?
-Edgar.
Edgar! He's come back.
Isn't it marvelous? It's Heathcliff.
I must see him.
All right. There's no need
to strangle me.
For heaven's sake,
he's only a run-away gypsy, after all.
-I'll tell him to come up, shall I?
-What, here?
I can't sit in the kitchen.
Nellie can set two tables then...
...one for you and Isabella
and one for him and me.
Don't be silly.
Would that please you or would you rather
have me stand at the kitchen door?
Catherine, for heaven's sake.
Nellie, go and fetch him up.
Catherine.
Thank you, Jenny.
Catherine, be glad by all means,
but please do not be absurd...
...especially in front of the servants.
I'll behave.
My wife has asked me
to receive you as a friend.
Would you care for some tea?
That would give me great pleasure.
Won't you sit down, sir?
You seem to have found good fortune.
In some respects.
-You look as if you've been abroad.
-Once or twice.
I'd simply love to travel one day to London.
It's...
...a curious place.
Was it difficult?
lt was a struggle.
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.
Three years you've been away
and you never even thought of me.
A little more than you've thought of me.
You're cruel.
I've fought through a bitter life
since last I heard your voice.
And you must forgive me...
...but l struggled only for you.
Catherine?
Catherine, unless we're to have cold tea,
would you kindly pour it now?
Mr. Heathcliff has a long ride tonight
to wherever he's lodging and I'm thirsty.
Mr. Earnshaw has offered me
lodgings at the Heights.
Hindley?
He has a mind to win some money
from me at cards.
All these years I've thought of you.
In every cloud.
In every tree.
You were near in mind, it was you.
Why did you stay away?
-How did you think that l would feel?
-How could I know?
Why did you come back?
To settle up with Hindley.
And see me.
And see me?
And maybe Edgar, too.
Why do you hate Edgar?
Because he married you.
Isabella!
Cathy!
-Come away with me.
-What?
-Come away with me!
-She may see us.
I don't.... Cathy!
We must go. Quick!
Cathy?
What do you got?
No.
I'm out.
Why?
-I haven't got any more money.
-We'll play for something else then.
What?
Barn?
The barn?
You'll win it back tomorrow.
All right. Who's got a piece of paper?
I'll go.
Isabella and I are out for a drive.
We thought we'd pay you a visit.
I haven't been here
since I was married.
Let's go for a walk.
Come on, Heathcliff.
Come on, it's easy.
I can't. Help me.
Don't be such a baby. I did it.
Go across the bridge then.
-When am I going to see you again?
-I don't know. Soon.
It's very difficult.
Edgar thinks that you're dangerous.
We'll just have to be careful for a while.
Let's go.
-Where to?
-Away!
You wanted to yesterday.
-Let's go now.
-No.
Why not?
-I want you.
-I've got things to do.
I want to be with you.
No.
I'm looking for a Mr. Green.
I hear you're a clever man
with paper and money, Mr. Green.
l manage what the law allows.
What does the law say about these?
Clumsily writ, but it's fair and square.
Mr. Earnshaw's got papers like these
all over the county.
Buy them for me Mr. Green.
All of them.
I'd hate to see the place
fall into the wrong hands.
Why do you always
serve me with cold tea?
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll change it.
And from now on,
even if I'm alone in the room...
...will you kindly shut the doors
when you go out, please?
You know very well I catch cold.
And she lets the fires go out,
when you two aren't there.
-What is the matter with you today?
-Nothing.
-I think l better call a doctor.
-There's nothing wrong with me.
You ought to go to bed.
I won't go to bed. Why should l?
Just because you don't like me,
you want me out of the way, don't you?
Always picking on me, making fun of me.
Thank you, Nellie.
Since when?
For weeks.
There's been nothing but trouble
since that damned Heathcliff came back.
It's nothing to do with him!
He's kind, at least.
Why pick on him?
He's done nothing to you.
-He's not coming here again.
-That's right!
We can never see anybody, can we?
Do what you like, the pair of you!
-Have you finished, sir?
-I doubt it!
Heathcliff, kind?
He'd crush you like a sparrow's egg.
Since when have l been picking on you?
Ever since he came back.
I know you want me out of the way.
Every time we go for a walk
you're always planning something.
I just thought you and Edgar
didn't like being with us.
Don't you tell me how l should feel.
Isabella.
You don't mean that you're...
...in love?
Yes.
Yes!
Let me go! You're....
-You're hurting me.
-You love it.
Someone will see.
Sweet breath.
Heathcliff.
Sweet, precious....
Darling.
-Do you fancy a tumble then?
-What's that?
And do you want it here, or in bed?
You beast!
What's the matter, Nellie?
He's the matter.
Him and Miss Isabella,
kissing and cuddling.
I thought I told you,
you were to leave Isabella alone.
Yes, you did.
-Did you start it or did she?
-What is it to you?
I'm not your husband.
You needn't be jealous of me.
And I'm not jealous!
Do what you like with her.
Edgar still won't let you into the house.
I don't give a damn about your little Edgar!
-I do what I want.
-No, you don't. You do what I want.
Nellie, could you get out of the room.
-I've got something to say to you.
-No! I've got something to say to you!
Look, I want you to understand
that I know how I've been treated.
And if you flatter yourself
that you've deceived me...
...or that I didn't know it,
then you're a fool.
I went through hell for you.
And if you think it's only me
that's going to suffer...
...then you'd better think again.
Why me? What have I done to you?
It's not you.
-It is not you.
-Isn't it?
Take Isabella. Hurt Edgar!
Destroy me!
-What was that shouting about?
-That was Miss Cathy and Mr. Heathcliff.
-Cathy and Heathcliff?
-In the kitchen, sir.
-He's been and took hold of Isabella, sir.
-What?
Yes, bold as brass, sir.
He took hold of her.
lf l thought you really wanted me
to marry Isabella...
...I'd cut my throat.
Where have you been?
Listening at the door?
There are many doubts
about your birth, sir...
...but you were certainly
not born a gentleman.
lt was foolish of me
to expect you to behave like one.
lf you're not out of this house within
three minutes, l intend to throw you out.
Edgar...
...you're not worth the trouble
of knocking down.
All right, Nellie, get the men.
lf you can't throw him out yourself...
-...apologize or take a beating.
-Catherine.
Damn you, Catherine.
I compliment your new taste Catherine.
Robert!
Please, for God's sake!
I'm not going to run
with his fist in my gullet!
Quick. He's brought the men
and he's got a gun.
-Open up!
-I'll move the larder!
-Open up, or I'll have the law on you!
-You are the law, you fool.
Go back!
You, l and Edgar are far from finished yet!
You better tell Isabella
to keep out of my way.
I'm going to bed.
Why?
Look, tell Edgar I'm ill.
-But you are not.
-Nellie, you'd better help me or...
...I'll make myself ill.
-You wicked girl.
-What do you keep saying that for?
Why should l be the only one to suffer?
I'm going to give them both
something to cry about.
Catherine.
Don't go.
I haven't come to argue.
I haven't come to apologize.
Then it would be better
if you said nothing at all.
I've put your supper outside.
l said....
Isabella, I warn you...
...if you are insane enough
to encourage his attentions...
...you'll lose every penny
you have in this house...
...and with it my love and protection.
I'm no worse off without that.
Then you can go to him empty-handed.
At least I'll give him
something you've not known.
Miss Cathy's been in her room
for three days now, sir.
She hasn't had any food or a drop to drink.
Shall I get Robert to force the door?
What and damage it?
No. She'll come out soon enough.
My poor baby.
You foolish thing.
How have you lasted?
I'm burning, Nellie. I'm burning.
With child?
Four or five months gone.
Didn't you know?
No!
I mean...
...no, I didn't.
This is marvelous!
-Have you heard?
-Yes.
Go and find Miss Isabella!
We must all be friends again!
-There's been some talk of....
-Isabella and Heathcliff?
But that's all finished now.
It's quite....
Miss Isabella?
Miss Cathy. No!
No, you mustn't.
-Get her by the legs!
-No!
No, let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go.
-She just went mad.
-What did you do to her?
It wasn't me. It's Heathcliff.
Heathcliff?
No, don't speak his name, ever.
Heathcliff.
He's run off with Miss Isabella.
What is it?
There are bad signs.
You're either going to lose her...
...or the child...
...or maybe lose both.
I mean, is there nothing you can do?
All we can do is to keep her in bed,
and she must stay there till the spring.
Meantime, keep her happy, keep her calm.
No upsets and no arguments.
They're the first spring flowers
from the Heights.
Has the snow almost gone?
Almost.
There's still a patch or two
on the high ground.
They remind me of the south wind...
...on the moors.
Do you remember how it was last year
when you asked me to marry you?
I wish...
...we could go back and start again.
I'd love to be free.
To be up there where the wind blows.
To run again.
You will.
Get off!
Here!
Joseph, what have you heard?
Will you help me, please?
I have better things to do!
Been sick. She's up now.
No more?
With child.
Seven months.
How's Edgar taken that?
He's waiting to see the color of its eyes.
And where do you think you're going?
He's back then.
Can you tell me where the maid is, please?
The maid?
Yes. I'd like to be shown my room.
You're the maid, girl.
You'll have to find it yourself.
How can l find it
when I don't know where it is?
Don't whine, for God's sake, girl.
Heathcliff's room is up the stairs,
second on the right.
And make sure you bolt the door...
...and lock it.
Why?
Because sooner or later
he's going to get this.
But why?
I've signed away half this house
and he's won the rest.
I mean to get it back and his money...
...and then I'll get him.
Suppose I tell him?
Tell him.
You can watch over him while he's asleep.
Sweet dreams.
Can I have a word with you, sir?
-What is it?
-They're back, sir.
I've had a note from Miss Isabella.
She's dreadful unhappy, sir...
...and begs forgiveness.
There's nothing to forgive.
Won't you just write her a little note, sir?
-Just to say--
-You may go and see her if you wish...
...and you may tell him...
...that if he ever sets foot here again,
I'll have him shot down.
Hello, Nellie.
It's all right, you can give her the note.
-There's no secrets between us.
-I don't have a note.
Your brother sends his love, ma'am...
...but says it's impossible to speak to you...
...or ever see you again.
I'm sorry.
Sit down, Nellie.
I want you to do me a favor.
What now?
You and Edgar...
...you destroyed me
and you both come to me...
...as if you were the ones to be pitied.
I shall not pity you.
You've killed me
and grown stronger for it, I think.
I wish I could hold you
till we were both dead.
Will you forget me?
Will you be happy when I'm gone?
You know you lie
to say that I've killed you.
I could as soon forget you as my life.
Are you not satisfied
that I'm in hell already?
ls it not enough
for your damned selfishness?
Don't be angry.
That's worse to remember
than my harsh words.
Heathcliff?
Come to me.
Do.
That's how I'm loved?
It's not my Heathcliff.
I shall love mine yet and take him with me.
He's in my soul!
I shall soon be dead.
Come to me.
Do.
Cathy, why did you do it?
You loved me!
Nothing in this world could have put us
apart, but you of your own will did it.
I have not broken your heart...
...you have.
lf I've done wrong, I'm dying for it.
That's enough.
Forgive me. l forgive you.
How can l?
How can l?
Quick! I've seen the Master's carriage.
-Cathy, I must go.
-No, you mustn't.
-For heaven's sake.
-I must, Cathy!
No.
For God's sake, don't listen to her.
-He's sworn to shoot you if he sees you.
-He can't hurt us now.
I'll not be far away.
-Quick, before we're all done for. Come on.
-I'll be back soon.
Heathcliff?
-Where's Heathcliff?
-Catherine.
Nellie.
Nellie!
-Nellie, what is it?
-I'll fetch the doctor.
Catherine.
The child's coming.
I'll be in the orchard.
Catherine Earnshaw, I say one prayer:
May you not rest while I am living.
Don't leave me!
Cathy?
Cathy!
Cathy!
Listen to him, hammering
as if he were master here already.
Are you game?
Or are you as soft as your brother?
Cathy!
Cathy?
Cathy!
