Police in hot pursuit after shots were fired on the runway last night...
...three or four masked men robbed an armoured vehicle
in what looks like an inside job.
After today's robbery,
the union is stopping all armoured transports in major cities.
...wearing the same yellow <i>vests</i> as those used by airport personnel.
Is it really a successful investigation
when four million Euros are still missing?
I didn't <i>say it was</i> a <i>success.</i>
It's obviously frustrating that the money's not been recovered.
- Rikard, where is he? - Sri Lanka.
- Where? - I don't know.
Get up.
BEE;
ls there a problem?
I'll have to ask you to take a seat and wait.
Excuse me, could you two step forward?
We need to ask you a few questions.
Why don't you come with me for a while?
We're just going to have a little talk with your mum. It won't take long.
Grandma's coming to get you. I'll see you soon, sweetie.
Everything's fine.
- We've picked up your suitcase. - What is this?
- Why did you come home alone? - Am I a suspect?
No, but you know very well that your husband is.
He's wanted for the robbery and murder at Landvetter Airport last year.
Four million Euros are missing.
What about these ashes?
- Kind of a strange souvenir... - ls it against the law?
If they're the ashes of a person, yes. We found bone particles.
- Did you get hold of my mother? - Yes. Your daughter is with her.
We're going to run a DNA test on the bone particles.
<i>_</i> Mummy. " Hi!
Where's your grandma?
Hello, Mother.
I want a tap on her phone. Her mother's as well.
Cokie drove the car. Rikard Swan was killed two months ago.
Rikard's brother, here and Bobby Mitic.
Mam-mam;
Tommy took the money.
If they're his ashes, they'll come after her. Estelle's not just the girlfriend.
She knows exactly what went down at Landvetter, and afterwards.
Go! Faster, Bobby!
Welcome back. How'd that feel? Impressive...
- Have some champagne. - Did you doubt me?
'FEE! awesome.
[HERA
- Sure... -What?
Ma.
Just heard from the cops. She's back.
<i>Do Wave a beard'? Does 'Monk good on me'?</i>
- No. - Do I look like Santa?
- Is the water nice? -Yeah.
Daddy
Honey, never say where we've been.
You know what?
It's our own little secret.
Pretty, huh?
So you're back...
Just put that down right there.
No, thanks. I've quit.
Right...
Do you know if Blanca is seeing anyone?
Bobby.
- Well, does she know that I'm back? - No.
I'm hereto pick up the money from the Landvetter heist, Mum.
I'm getting help to have it transferred to Sri Lanka.
Now is my only chance. Before anyone finds out.
Then Isabel and I will go back.
What are you doing?
A friend of mine lives here. Rikard.
[HEB
Oh, no! God damn <i>it...</i>
HIGH
Depends on the mood you're going for. This is more rigid, but...
This looks like a burning oil platform or something.
You can't even tell what it is.
- I thought you were dead! - <i>Hi...</i>
Do you know what people say? You went to Rio, to China...
That you had all this plastic surgery.
Come on.
What the hell? What a fucking surprise!
And you brought your little sister... - Hello.
What did you do to our place?
- Where's Tommy? How is he? - Good. And Claudia?
Great. You should come and see us. What are you drinking? - Matte!
- You sure look happy. So you're out? - He found God inside.
Sit down.
The Svensson sisters. Stockholm's finest.
Estelle's home.
- What? - Nothing.
- Can we talk? - Sure!
Stay here!
<i>Abbe...</i>
Got him straight from Istanbul. Check out his stove! Insane!
He's coming home. Tommy is coming home.
Great news.
- He needs the money now. -What money?
Our share.
I can't discuss this with you, it's got to be Tommy.
Do you really want that?
- I've taken care of everything here. - Taken over, you mean.
One million Euros on Tuesday.
After that, I can't help you.
All right if l bum one?
Thought you quit.
I did.
[HIGH
HIGH
- What? - They didn't pay.
Never interrupt me!
I want people at my house around the clock.
- Can't you talk to him? - To Tommy? You've got to be kidding.
<i>Go away.</i>
Go away!
It was my mother's.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry...
Don't jump on the couch, silly-billy!
Listen...
[HEW-
ls that couch good for jumping?
- Yes. - Really?
Okay...
So, who jumps the highest?
I'm worried about Estelle.
She says that Tommy's coming home.
Talk to her. Promise me, Steve.
I'll talk to her. It'll be fine.
The whole city is talking about Tommy returning.
- His wife went to Cabrera yesterday. - No kidding?
Nice. It's payback time.
Blanca?
WHEEL}
Do I need to feed you like you're a baby? Jeez...
<i>Oh...</i> Hello, Claudia!
Estelle! Look at <i>you...</i> I heard you were back.
- Good to see you. - And you. I heard you bought a house.
Yes, in Appelviken. You must come for dinner.
- Hi. - Hi.
- How about ice cream? In the kitchen... - I'll go and keep them in line.
It was so nice to see you. Let's have lunch. Bye.
- My kids are here! - If you ever come near her again...
If he knows you've been seeing her, he won't want your money.
I need more time. I can't get a million that fast.
700 k. I can get 700 k.
I thought you liked this life.
Nice of you to stop by. - Drive her wherever she wants.
Child-proof...
So he's coming home for 1 million?
Doesn't he want more?
Hope he gets here soon, for your sake.
- There's a seat in business class. - I'll take it.
- And the passenger's name? - Blanca Svensson, double s.
[HEMP
- Hell no! - You're upset, I understand.
- But they're not even registered to me! -We can't...
'MEG?
This country's gone to shit!
- Well, well, well... - Hello.
[HEM
- Cheers. - Cheers.
Where's Isabel? Doesn't she get to see her old godfather?
- She's with Blanca. - I see. And how is she doing?
- She met a guy who isn't good for her. - Should I do something about that?
- No. - I could talk to him.
Mn.
<i>So, do you need money'?</i>
<i>You two...</i> Oh <i>my.</i>
I heard Tommy's coming home.
So, now they'll take it to the streets again. You stay away from that, right?
- I don't get mixed up in business. - Good.
Don't do anything stupid. If anything happens, come to me.
You know that. I'm always here.
- My star. - Thanks, Steve.
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Tell Tommy to get in touch with me. - Of course.
That's my wife's new stuff.
Completely
<i>Christ...</i>
Cute, isn't it? Twenty five thousand.
- Hands off! - It's going back.
- Are you crazy? - Steve called me.
- Is he footing the bills? - Cool it. Look at this...
Could you butt out of my business!
When will you ever start supporting yourself?
Stop feeling so god damned sorry for yourself.
Who is paying it back? Well?
Who will pay it back?
Hey! Am I supposed to do it? Or maybe Isabel should do it?
Mummy wants you to come home now.
Me too.
And Blanca...
Please!
Okay...
Guess what? I got to hold Frank's leash myself.
Who are you talking to?
Nobody.
- Try blowing on him now. - He's embarrassed...
Christ, what now?
Tommy called.
- What? -Yeah...
Isabel talked to him.
Are you trying to be funny?
What? No.
- What are you talking about? - Isabel spoke to him on the phone.
She really misses him.
Right... I'm a bad mother.
- What? - That's what you're saying, isn't it?
She tries to be just like you.
She's going to be something else.
He's really taken care of me.
HEW?
Say that you're the only one who really understands him?
How did you know? He's a Scorpio.
It's like we're meant for each other.
They look like gifts at first.
Then all of a sudden, he's signing over his debts to you.
And if you get pregnant, you're stuck forever.
I was sixteen when I met Tommy. You're twenty-five.
Yes, but you don't know him.
You do know he paid for Rikard's funeral, don't you?
He sold out his best friends.
They got away with four million Euros.
Landvetter
I told Tommy beforehand. It's too much money, it's...
People get greed?'-
He wouldn't listen.
Rikard was to give me Tommy's share. But Rikard gets murdered.
And suddenly, Bobby is king of the whole city.
He tricked us.
That includes you.
What's Tommy going to do?
We're leaving this fucking country.
The refrigerator market in Asia has exploded. Everyone wants one...
<i>...so</i> we'll open a kitchen appliance store.
In a few years, we can sell it for at least three times more.
- That's Tommy's brilliant scheme? - I'll be "Mrs. Fridge".
- So you guys are leaving again? - I'm not leaving you.
Come with us.
You'll see, the people are fantastic. Their hearts are...
a completely
- Tommy wants you to come too. - Did he say that?
So we can be a family again.
Bobby...
So, how do we solve this?
I've got to talk to Tommy.
- You want to speak to Tommy? - I need guarantees.
Straight from Tommy.
What, you'll go for a coffee?
I'm going to speak to Tommy.
Then let's call him right now. I'm sure he'll understand.
Wait...
- You know him. - I love him.
He asked me to pick up the money.
We're like brothers, you know?
I can't help you if I don't get the money.
- Estelle, I didn't take the money. - Come <i>on...</i>
- I can't pay. - Do you really want to do this?
No. But that's the way it is.
When you took off, the pigs went absolutely nuts.
So you think he split with the money too?
Like I'd ever say that, Estelle.
Anybody who <i>says</i> that I did, is a liar.
He wants his stuff now.
- Is it since the heist? -Yes.
They all disappeared. So did the money.
But now, if Tommy's coming...
Hello. Kady, right? Look at you, all grown up!
- You got shoes on indoors, moron? -Yeah.
- Go write love poems instead. - Gonna make me?
- Watch it! Do you do the cleaning? - Yes, I do.
- I don't have time for this. - Drop dead.
- Show some respect. I have a guest. - Like I care?
985 grams. I haven't touched any of it. Let Tommy know that.
The stuff can't come out before he gets home. Bobby would go berserk.
- Hello, Estelle. - Hello, Ergon.
Wow. Where does this come from?
I don't know, I just do what Tommy tells me.
- It's a first stab at Bobby. - So, when's he coming home?
Shit!
Estelle!
Put your seat belt on. Please.
We've been tapping your mother's phone for a few days.
When is he coming?
Can I go now? I have to get home to my daughter.
Estelle, shouldn't she have started school last fall?
It will be in the news tomorrow that Tommy's dead.
Mammalian
Jesus, do you have to smoke in here?
[HEMP
If anything happens to me, then you take care of her.
I'll be back in a few hours.
Don't answer the phone. Don't go out, don't open the door.
Nothing's going to happen.
Just don't go out.
AIRPORT ROBBER DEAD
ls everything okay?
Of course.
I saw this really sick thing on Facebook the other day.
A handicapped girl begging for money on the streets of New York.
The camera followed her, but she didn't know it.
They filmed for a few days. And every clay after work...
...she'd get on the bus, get off a few blocks later and go change.
She'd be healthy and good-looking.
Go to nice restaurants.
AURA.
What a whore... Tricking people out of money.
When is Tommy coming home?
The papers say that he's dead.
But that's exactly how we want it.
Tommy is fucking crazy.
No! No!
Let go! Let go! Oh, god.
You think I can't read? Huh?
You think I'm stupid? You're trying to turn Bobby against me!
- Cokie... He's coming home. - Shut up. You, of all people!
- He's alive, okay? - Say hi to Tommy.
- No! - Give me back my coke.
All of it. Or we'll be back. I'm not your bitch, got it?
Who did this?
My little star... who was it?
The papers say Tommy is dead.
- He's alive. - Talk to me.
He's still down there. I came to see Mum and Blanca.
Why did they take you out into the woods?
- I don't know. - Oh, yes you do.
- If they think they can attack <i>you...</i> - I don't want you to do anything.
Thanks, Steve.
Blanca?
- He's home. -You think?
This has to stop. Find Estelle.
- Why don't you just talk to Tommy? - I don't know where he is.
Find her. They get the money now.
- What? - <i>Okay...</i>
So what the hell are you doing?
Are you going sailing?
WWW-w
I asked for one simple thing, Blanca: Don't leave the apartment.
You were gone for two days. Have you seen the papers?
It's not true.
Honey, we're going to Grandma's. Go pack up your things, and hurry.
- They blew up Cabrera. - <i>Okay...</i>
"Okay"? Didn't you hear me? They blew up Cabrera!
- You weren't supposed to talk to him. - I didn't!
- That's great... - I dumped him for your sake!
Do you know that he loves me?
Here's the thing: you're one of the girls he fucks besides his wife.
Stop thinking with your cunt.
- What did you say? - Are you hard of hearing?
Where the hell do you get off saying that?
Listen... If we don't leave in two days, we won't get out of the country.
- Whose fault is that? - Mine!
- Yes, yours! - Happy? You're so immature.
Immature? Why are you always ruining everything? You're so fucking cold!
- Come on! - No, I'm not going on your stupid trip!
Do you hear me? You're just like Mum!
Take off your clothes.
Wait!
Now you're going to tell me what the hell is going on here.
I went to see Cokie. Know what he said?
Do you know what Cokie's last words were?
- What do you mean? - That Estelle screwed you over.
Tommy sent her. It was Tommy.
I have something for you.
Go play, hone?-
What are these ashes they're writing about?
So you can read?
Bobby didn't take the money.
How do you know that?
Rikard gave me something. Something for Tommy.
Wild?
Ask Tommy.
My brother is dead.
Whoever killed him will pay for it.
William... Come on, we're going now.
You're not just someone's girl anymore, Estelle.
You've started a fucking war.
Honey, come here.
The money from Landvetter. ls it still around?
I don't know. I swear, I don't know.
<i>Here we go...</i>
- There's just one left. - Save it for tomorrow.
I think you should call Steve.
He just wants to help you.
<i>Hey... Sweetie...</i>
Here. It's Christmas.
It's Christmas!
Merry Christmas.
Listen...
We need to borrow some money.
Just until Tommy gets here...
Sure... That's fantastic weed. Great weed.
Isabel...
Come here. Come on.
Don't be shy now. Come here.
I think you should look under the tree. In the bag under the tree.
Go and have a look.
- What do we say? - Thank you.
Right. Come here. Come and sit here.
Did you talk to Daddy?
How's he doing?
He'll be home soon.
<i>Scoot, so</i> I <i>can...</i>
There. What a nice game.
Want to take a look?
Yes? Sure. How did it go?
Do you like it?
Ilk-IRE W?
It was up at the gallery where Blanca works.
Your mother asked <i>me...</i> While you were in Sri Lanka.
Because that's where you were, right?
Hurry. There you <i>go...</i>
- Where are you going? - Mum's waiting.
She can wait.
Have a seat.
So you didn't manage to take the money with you?
- Steve, I can explain. - Hush.
I told you I would help you.
Here. Tommy's ashes.
After everything I've done for <i>you...</i>
<i>...you lie to me.</i>
- He's coming home. - No.
He's not coming.
You found him on the beach.
Where's the money?
You really think you can trick me and get away with it?
You fucking snake!
Come on, honey. We have to go.
Wait!
Can you watch her tonight?
Does Bobby have anything to do with this?
Mn.
It's much worse than that.
I don't have anyone else.
Listen... I know who murdered your brother.
Steve planned Landvetter and I know where Tommy hides his stuff.
Hey, baby. It's me. What's up?
- Where are you? - I can't tell you.
- I need to see you. Please. - That's not possible.
- I need to see you. - I'll call you later.
Okay, promise me. Promise. Right. We'll do that. <i>Bye...</i>
- She left the kid with Blanca. - So go pick them up.
- She's not at home. - Give them to me.
- She wouldn't say where they were. - Just do what I tell you to do.
But she doesn't have anything to do with this.
- Are you sure Tommy is dead? - Just do what I tell you to do.
Here you go. Bobby's money.
Seven hundred thousand Euros. Transfer it all to Sri Lanka.
Tommy won't forget this.
- Hello? - How are you guys doing?
- She's asleep. - Blanca, listen to me.
Catch a cab on the street. Don't call for one.
Go to Arlanda Airport, Terminal 5. Wait for me there.
- I have the money. We're leaving now. - Okay.
Go to Terminal 5. Wait for me there.
Okay. Bye-
Fuck Estelle! What do you want? It's you and me against the world.
- It's all fucked! - Nothing's fucked. I'll fix it.
I love you. I need you. I need you, Blanca. I'm here.
- Where? - I'm here... waiting.
Meet me. I need to see you. I'll take care of this. Talk to me.
- Can you do it now? - I can do it anytime.
Mum-indium
Where, baby? Come on, Blanca.
- <i>Okay...</i> Meet me at Hornstull. - Hornstull? When, now?
- I love you. I need you. - You're completely nuts.
Let's put your jacket on.
Hang on. There.
No! No! Stop the bus!
Frank!
M. Axum-me
He wants you to come now or I'll never see you again.
Good girl, Isabel.
- Hello? - I want to see them first.
Mummy! Mummy! Mummy...
Mummy!
Mummy!
Mummy! Mummy!
You're going to tell me where the money is.
Not until I speak to Blanca. After she's checked in at the airport.
You know, I could skin you right now.
Or send some guys to the airport to pick up the girls. Now tell me.
You can do whatever you want to me.
But touch them, and you'll never find out.
My <i>star...</i>
Hey...
You were going to sacrifice yourself.
I didn't expect that from you.

- Honey, it's Mummy. Open up. - I don't want to.
Oh, honey, you have to open up. We've got to go.

No. No, honey. Daddy isn't coming. Daddy...
Daddy's dead.
Honey, open the door now.
