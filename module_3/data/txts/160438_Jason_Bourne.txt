I remember.
I remember everything.
Captain Webb. Good morning.
Has everything been explained to you?
Yes, sir.
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
You knew exactly what
it meant for you if you chose to stay.
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.
You made yourself into who you are.
Eventually you're gonna have
to face the fact.
You volunteered.
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!
Christian Dassault made a reservation.
Heather Lee.
Ma'am, we have a device
issued to a stay-behind team
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.
Marked on our inventory as destroyed.
It's knocking on our front door.
What's the status?
Whoever it is, is just sitting there idle.
There's no outbound traffic, nothing.
Move.
They've found a back door.
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.
I'm working on it.
Okay, people, we have a major breach
of our classified mainframe.
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!
Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.
Got it.
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?
Unknown user. Monitoring.
Reykjavik.
SecOps hacking camp.
Kill the power to the building.
Get into that power grid now.
Yes, sir.
- I've got the power to the building.
- Stand by.
- Ten seconds.
- Let's get on top of this.
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.
Dewey.
We've just been hacked.
How badly?
Could be worse than Snowden.
Is there any attribution?
We're working on it.
Lee says it must be someone
with a deep knowledge of our systems.
This could affect Deep Dream, and Iron Hand.
I want a briefing
in my conference room in one hour.
Yes.
- Did you get confirmation?
- Yeah, there was a hack.
So are we exposed?
We don't know yet. We're checking.
I want you to call Dewey.
Set up a meet in DC.
Aaron, we got a lot at stake here,
- maybe we shouldn't rock the boat.
- Just do it.
Hey, George. We ready for the launch?
Heather, you know
the Director of National Intelligence?
Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.
Have you got a name for us?
The hacker was a former Agency operative.
Believed to be working
with Christian Dassault,
and previously linked to Jason Bourne.
Bourne?
- Jesus Christ.
- What did they get?
Black-ops files.
From Treadstone all the way to Iron Hand.
Iron Hand?
But that's not even operational yet,
for Christ's sakes.
Where is Nicky Parsons right now?
On the move.
She left Reykjavik,
traveling through Bucharest to Athens.
Feels like a meet to me.
Well, how are you going to handle it?
We cut the head off this thing.
Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.
You're not indoctrinated for this material.
I'm already into it.
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.
Let me in.
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.
Excuse me.
I appreciate your enthusiasm,
but do not push your personal agenda
to the DNI again.
Understood.
All right. I think you can help me.
I'm going to give you
full operational control on this,
and I will make sure you have access
to any relevant teams and resources.
And I want to know every move you make.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Yeah?
I need your help, now.
I'm not finished here.
Jason Bourne is in play.
- Where?
- Athens.
Close your account in Rome.
Understood.
Lee got a hit from a CCTV feed.
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago,
headed west across Athens.
I got two local teams en route.
- Any sign of Bourne?
- Not so far.
He's involved in this somehow. I can feel it.
Upload all Athens data and feeds,
and activate real-time processing.
Copy that.
Where are we?
Parsons' bus has just arrived
at Syntagma Square.
There's a demonstration
in front of the Greek parliament building.
I think she'll use it as cover.
Deploy Alpha and Bravo to the square.
Recon for Parsons
in the crowd outside parliament,
and any possible rendezvous points.
Copy that, sir.
Sir, the Asset has landed.
Alpha Team arriving now.
Copy that.
I have the Alpha Team feeds.
Pull them up.
Athens police are reporting tactical teams
moving on the demonstrators.
Isolate all social-media posts
from the square.
Yes, ma'am.
Rewind Alpha One's feed.
Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.
All right, Bravo Two, Four, moving in.
What's wrong?
I hacked the Agency.
For Christian Dassault.
I got all the black-ops files.
We're putting them online.
We need to move.
Stop.
Two seconds forward.
Blonde hair.
Enhance.
Find her.
Nicky Parsons sighted in
Syntagma Square. Redirect south on Stadiou.
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.
We don't have a choice, Jason.
It's started again. A new program.
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.
What's that got to do with me?
Because it matters. It matters.
Not to me, it doesn't.
All that matters is staying alive.
You get off the grid, survive.
I don't believe that and neither do you.
Look at yourself.
Look at what you're doing.
You can't live like this for much longer.
Jason, I came here
because I found something.
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.
He was an analyst.
He wasn't in Operations.
He wasn't near any of that stuff.
I'm telling you what I saw.
It looked like he was involved directly.
And there's more.
More about you.
What do you mean?
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.
Watching me?
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.
You torture yourself for what you've done.
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.
You need to read those files.
Move. They tracked you.
Alpha One has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.
Identify the male.
Copy that, sir.
Alpha One, we need an ID on the male target.
We've got to get out of here before
the police cut off this part of the city.
Head north.
Meet me at the statue of Athena.
I'll take them with me.
That's him.
Now.
Stay with Bourne.
Clear to engage the target.
Copy.
Alpha Team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.
Come on.
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.
We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.
Find Parsons. He'll come back to get her.
Sir, rioting is spreading.
The Greek government
is declaring a state of emergency.
Bravo Team, we are retargeting Parsons.
We got her.
Split the team, put her in a box.
A suspect matching Bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.
He's coming for Parsons.
Where the hell is the Asset?
Two minutes out, sir.
Parsons is at the statue of Athena.
Copy that.
Bravo Team is down.
Sir, the Asset is arriving on scene.
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.
Give me the feed
and direct comms to the Asset.
Engaging targets.
I'm accessing Athens police tactical data.
I need eyes overhead.
Bring up the satellite suite.
Sir, I'm showing a Misty
and a KH-12 satellite available.
- Light up the 12.
- Yes, sir.
Satellite video feed is online.
Police have blocked the road to the north.
The target will be forced to turn left.
Another barricade in 200 meters.
Target turning left again.
Bourne's heading for the alley.
Left at the top of the hill.
Stairway.
Up the hill. Heading east.
Give me a strike point.
He's found a way out.
Two hundred meters to your left.
19 Solomou. Get to the roof.
Target should pass within your line of sight.
19 Solomou. Copy.
Focus the satellites on these coordinates.
And give me a lock
on the motorcycle when it gets there.
Copy that.
I've got the targets.
They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.
Look west.
The long boulevard.
Coming at you in 55 seconds.
Copy that.
The Asset is online.
Target's with you in 15 seconds.
Five seconds.
Contact.
Stay low!
Find a shot.
Hold on!
Targets are down.
Where's Bourne?
Ma'am, a police helicopter spotted
three bodies on the roof near the Asset.
A tactical team's on its way.
Nicky?
Don't move!
Athens police have entered the building.
Asset, you need to get out of there.
Negative.
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.
You want to lose this guy?
This is Director Dewey.
You have 20 seconds.
Hold on, Nicky.
I'm going to get you to cover.
No.
No.
No, don't.
I'm coming.
- Get a location on Christian Dassault.
- Yes, sir.
If he was working with Nicky
Parsons, he will lead us to Jason Bourne.
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.
Sir, can I clarify one thing?
Yeah.
Does the Asset know Bourne?
Why would you ask me that?
His behavior on the rooftop.
It suggested a connection.
The last time Bourne came back,
he exposed the Blackbriar program.
It compromised active operations.
The Asset was in Syria undercover.
He was captured, tortured,
and it took two damn years to get him out.
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?
To go public again?
I have no idea why he came back.
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.
We can't let that happen.
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.
Yes, sir.
And now,
the founder and chairman of Deep Dream,
Aaron Kalloor.
Hi.
Uh...
You all know why we're here.
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.
We think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better.
We're a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries.
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.
And what this new platform will do
will be to integrate users' data
and preferences,
and use that information
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.
I mean, this is something that matters to us.
And let me just say, uh,
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.
So let me just tell you, when you come
to Deep Dream, when you use our service,
no one will be watching you.
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.
Enjoy your meal.
Thank you.
Congratulations.
I hear your stockholders
were very happy with that new platform.
And I heard you got hacked.
We're dealing with it.
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.
I'm out.
Aaron,
you are an extraordinarily gifted
and perceptive young man.
When you agreed to help us,
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm
I'll have on my hands
if this arrangement becomes public?
I already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.
We need a back door into your new
platform, and a way past the encryptions.
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.
You don't get it, do you?
Privacy is freedom.
Maybe that's something
you should think about defending.
You little prick, you didn't believe
in privacy or freedom
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.
I paid you back many, many, many times over.
And I was never comfortable with any of this.
I'm out.
I'm done selling out our customers.
But you would sell out your country.
The truth is, we wouldn't be
having this conversation
if you didn't feel personally at risk.
You talk about a free Internet,
you tell yourself you're saving the world,
but all you're doing is making it
a much more dangerous place.
And you're sure as hell making
this country much more difficult to defend.
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.
Accountable.
Bourne?
Everything on the table.
Open it.
Sure.
Bourne has surfaced. In Berlin.
Get the Berlin team up.
Where is she?
She's dead.
She knew the risks.
I warned her.
She made a choice.
You exploited her.
Berlin team is mobile.
What do we have on the location?
It's an address linked to Christian Dassault.
Anything on Bourne?
Nothing yet. I'm accessing CCTV now.
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.
What if he's not coming for us?
What if it's something else?
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.
We should work together, Bourne.
You exposed the Blackbriar program.
We're both after the same thing, right?
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.
I'm not on your side.
CCTV feed is online.
He's on a computer.
We have to stop this.
If he puts those files online,
operations will be compromised
and people will die.
Yes, sir.
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.
These programs have to be exposed.
People have a right to know.
We need that computer.
There's a phone in the room.
I can use it to delete the files.
- Got the phone.
- Where's that team?
Five minutes out, sir.
We're running out of time. Get there.
Listen to me, David.
I've done something.
Something...
...that came at a cost.
One day you'll understand why.
I gotta get back to Washington.
I love you, son.
They're fighting, sir.
One more firewall.
Files deleted, sir.
Call in.
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.
I'm not in charge here.
I wasn't here when you went missing.
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.
Retracing your history.
I know you're looking for something.
Let me help you find it.
Give me that phone.
Yes, sir.
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?
Jason, your dad was a patriot.
He could see the threats
that America was facing,
and, like you, he chose to serve his country
out of a profound sense of duty.
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.
You have to stop this.
And you have to stop it now.
Sir, our ETA is...
He's on the move. Be ready.
Take point!
On me!
The elevator.
We lost him, sir.
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.
Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance
in the late '90s,
when Bourne was recruited.
Is he still active?
He's private security now.
Contact the Asset and tell him I want
him on the ground in London in six hours.
I think that could be a mistake, sir.
A mistake? Why?
There is an argument for catching Bourne
instead of killing him.
All right, let's hear it.
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.
He knows things that could help us.
Bringing him back in is the smart move.
And how are we going to do that?
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.
He concluded Bourne
is still a patriot at heart,
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.
And what are you suggesting?
I watched Bourne with those files.
Desperately looking into his past.
And I think he's at a tipping point.
If I could get face-to-face with him,
I think I can bring him back in.
One attempt.
And if it fails,
you do what you have to.
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?
Let's give it a shot.
All right, do it.
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.
But this ends now.
Thank you, sir.
Sir, I'm sorry...
No, don't worry about that.
Better get some sleep, kid.
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.
Yes, sir.
It's taking too long. It shouldn't
still be buggy this close to launch.
Well, I don't think it's buggy.
I think we've changed some things
that's going to change the parameters.
We're going to have to go and...
Okay, we need to change them back.
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?
- Absolutely.
- Look, I think you're right,
- I just don't think we want to...
- I'm tired of waiting.
Mr. Kalloor.
What the hell is this?
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Burroughs.
I'm from the Department of Justice.
I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint...
- Really? We have to do this in public?
- Issued by the US government
against Deep Dream Corporation
for violation of the Sherman Act.
This complaint requires you to preserve all
personal and corporate financial records
pending antitrust motions
to be filed in federal court.
Good day.
- This is Dewey.
- Aaron, it's a message.
And maybe we should think about
what we're doing before it gets any worse.
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.
I want you to pull up all the records
of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?
Especially those.
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.
Yeah.
Are you in London?
Yes.
Why are you sending her?
She serves a purpose.
I work alone.
Not this time.
Don't make this personal.
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.
You know who you're dealing with.
You better make sure you're ready.
Yeah.
There's something
you should know about Deep Dream.
But I need an assurance
that I have your support.
You got it. What do you have?
Kalloor is planning something for Vegas.
Yes?
This is Jason Bourne.
I need to talk.
What about?
I don't work for the Agency anymore.
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.
Bourne just called Smith.
They're meeting at Paddington Plaza.
15 minutes.
We'll tail Smith the whole way.
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne,
I'll approach him.
Whatever you do, stay contained.
I don't want the Brits crawling all over us,
asking questions.
Understood.
Tracking device.
You'll hold on the south side of the bridge.
I'll contact you if I need you.
Sure.
You're the boss, right?
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.
Alpha Team, take a parallel track.
Bravo Team, follow the subject from behind.
And keep your eyes open for Bourne.
Bravo Team tailing subject.
Let's go.
In 200 meters, make a right.
Copy that.
Comms check. Second channel. Do you copy?
I have you. Where are you now?
Heading towards Smith.
No sign of Bourne.
Subject has turned east, into an alley.
Alpha Team, that alley leads to
a footbridge, which will bring him to you.
Copy that.
Bravo Team is down.
Sending you updated route now.
You copy that, Smith?
Yes.
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?
Bravo Team, do you copy?
What's happening, Heather? Where's Bravo?
We're comms down on Bravo.
Alpha Team, do you have
eyes on the subject?
We have eyes on.
Alpha Team, sit-rep.
Alpha Team, report.
What's happening, Heather?
Alpha Team isn't responding.
Bravo?
Still nothing.
You lost both teams?
Get a grip on this operation, Heather.
That's Bourne.
Green-light the Asset.
Sir, I need more time.
We have no time.
Are you going to give that order or not?
Sir, please.
You are too naive to see the truth.
There's no bringing in Bourne.
He has to be put down, and you obviously
cannot do what has to be done.
I am taking operational control.
Asset, you have a green light.
Repeat, you have a green light on Bourne.
Copy that.
I'm on my way.
Asset, are you on the move?
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.
Are you moving?
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.
Left here.
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.
In position.
Locked in.
What's going on?
What's that noise?
Multiple fire alarms.
That's Bourne.
What do I do?
You stay there. You do not move.
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.
I can't stay here.
You can't protect me.
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.
You still have line of sight?
I'm on him.
You're gonna shoot him in a crowd
when he's right next to me?
Stay where you are, Smith.
You know why he's here.
He wants answers.
You've lost this thing.
I gotta get out of here.
Shit!
What the hell is going on?
Bourne's got Smith.
Go after them.
I'll come around and cut them off.
Smith, we know you're with Bourne.
You have to find a way
to let us know where you are.
Why are you taking me in here?
They've got to be near the Plaza.
Jesus, Bourne!
God damn it!
What are you doing? Take it easy.
Richard Webb.
Station Chief, Beirut.
He was my father. He started Treadstone.
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?
- Jesus!
- Why did he hire you?
Don't say anything, Smith.
No. No.
There's no sign of them.
What do you want us to do?
Work your way down the canal.
I'll circle around and meet you there.
You followed me to Beirut.
The last time I saw my father!
Why would he have you follow me?
It doesn't make any sense. Why?
Don't give him a goddamn thing.
Why?
Jesus Christ, Bourne! I'm falling!
Bourne, please!
I can hear them!
Beirut.
I went there to tell him
that Treadstone had approached me.
But if it was his program,
why didn't he say anything to me?
I've done something.
Something...
...that came at a cost.
That was the day he was killed.
They said he was killed by terrorists.
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?
Think about your family's safety, Smith.
You keep your mouth shut.
The next bullet's in your head!
Why was he killed?
Why?
He was killed because of you.
Your father, he wasn't in Operations.
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...
He threatened to expose the program.
He didn't want you turned into a killer.
Who killed him?
Who killed him?
Don't do it.
Where is he?
He's almost there.
We're gonna stop this now.
No, please.
Somebody help! Call an ambulance!
Someone help!
He went off the roof. Five floors.
He recognized me.
I'm going to make sure it's finished.
Help's coming now.
No, don't get up, mate.
Step aside, please. Step aside.
Everybody step back.
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.
Did anybody see what happened?
He's gone.
- Oh, shit.
- I'm going after him.
I'll work my way down the canal.
No. You're done in London.
What are you talking about?
There's another play to be made.
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,
and that could be the opportunity
for something else.
This isn't about revenge.
Yes, it is.
And it won't be done until one of us is dead.
Get to the airport.
We have a problem with Iron Hand.
Copy that.
Give me a sit-rep.
We've got nothing.
Keep looking.
Drive.
It wasn't supposed to go like this.
I wanted to talk.
Where's Dewey going?
He's going to Vegas to speak
with Aaron Kalloor at a cyber convention.
The Agency recruits there every year.
What's Iron Hand?
Dewey's new black-ops program.
Full-spectrum surveillance.
Watching everyone all the time.
Dewey needs Kalloor's cooperation
to bring it online.
Let me out.
I can help you get there.
Why would you do that?
You and I have different reasons,
but we both want Dewey gone.
Here, take this.
I'll see you in Vegas.
Sir.
We're pinning Kalloor's hit
on a fictional jihadi shooter.
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.
He'll look like a lone wolf.
Any physical evidence?
The Asset leaves the gun.
It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.
Russell doesn't need to know about this.
I understand, sir.
Any news on Bourne?
Nothing.
He was always gonna come for me.
Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.
What was the purpose of your visit
to London, Mr. Michaels?
Business.
Welcome home, sir.
Thank you.
Parking lot clear. You're good to go.
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.
Hi, welcome to the Aria.
- Heather Lee, checking in.
- Okay.
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite.
Number 2016.
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.
Aaron!
All right, Aaron!
Deep Dream!
Find Lee.
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.
Yes, sir.
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.
Yes, sir.
Coming through, make a hole.
Make a hole, make a hole.
Gonna make a quick stop here.
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going? Aaron.
Good to meet you.
Can I get one?
Thanks very much for your hard work.
Thank you.
You're doing a great job.
Yeah.
You all set?
Checking the departure route now.
You won't have much time.
They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing, left hand at my side.
You put a bullet in it.
It's better if I'm a target, too.
Copy that.
Lee.
The Director wants a word
before you go on stage.
Of course.
ID?
Thanks.
Ah.
Heather.
My protégée. Strongest supporter.
You know, after what happened in London,
I did not know what to do with you.
I suppose we'll just, um,
write it off to your learning curve.
I'd appreciate that.
At least you can
now see that you never had a chance.
When Bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.
Do you understand?
Of course.
I agree completely.
When we get on stage,
I'll handle all the policy questions,
throw everything technical to you.
I'll be ready, sir.
Okay, let's do this.
Badges?
Aaron.
Robert.
You know Heather Lee.
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?
Challenging. But fulfilling.
It's tough to stay true
to your principles over there?
My principles are just fine, thanks.
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.
I'm going to enjoy this.
So am I.
Thank you, sir.
Oh! Hi! How's everybody doing tonight?
Welcome.
Welcome.
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.
We are so lucky to have
four fantastic guests this evening.
The CIA Director, Robert Dewey, is here.
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,
the CEO of social-media giant Deep Dream,
Aaron Kalloor is here.
Tonight, "Policing a free Internet",
"personal rights versus public safety."
This is the great question of our time.
And the choices we make about this
will determine our future.
So let's just dive right in, okay?
Come on out here, guys.
Sir, you've got an incoming message.
High priority.
All right, guys, I'm gonna have to take this.
I'll catch up with you later.
Go ahead.
Thanks for having me. Hey.
It appears Director Dewey
is held up momentarily,
and I am being told
that it shouldn't be too much longer.
But we have a ton of stuff
to get into tonight,
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?
- Excuse me?
- Can I get the ball rolling?
Oh, sure, man, by all means.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.
Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at EXOCON
for having us back,
and to you guys for turning out.
Before the Director comes out to join us,
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.
A long time ago, I had this idea.
- Copy that.
- A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...
Facial recognition got a hit.
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.
It landed two hours ago.
How the hell did he get through immigration?
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.
Well, it turned out
to be a pretty popular idea.
Um...
People from around the world
started using our service.
Well, first off, this has all made me
a lot more rich than is probably healthy.
When I come on stage,
take care of Kalloor and the girl.
Copy.
But, what I mean to say is that, you know,
all this success has come at a cost.
There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.
A guilty secret, and, um...
I have to share it with all of you guys.
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.
Whoa, whoa...
- Stay there.
- Okay.
When I was starting out, I, uh...
I took money to start my company.
Made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit...
...and now he's come back to take my soul.
I see the shooter!
We've got eyes on Jason Bourne.
He's still breathing. Call an ambulance!
Go, go!
- Let's go!
- Sir, we gotta go.
Head for the exit!
This is Vasquez. We're on Bourne.
Get the cars ready!
Get the cars ready right now!
No, take me to the suite.
Sir, we've got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.
You heard me. Take me to the suite.
Yes, sir.
Take him to the suite. Take him upstairs.
Get him upstairs.
Right now. Right now.
Up to the suite.
- Let's go, right now. Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.
Come this way.
This way. Don't worry. Come on.
Out of the way! Federal agent!
Vasquez, sit-rep.
Vasquez, come in!
Hey!
Okay, we've got him. Sir, this is Collier.
- We've ID'd the sniper.
- Shit.
We're circulating his photo now.
What about Bourne?
Hang on.
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west
service corridor, heading for the lobby.
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.
What?
We're still looking for Bourne.
And they've ID'd the Asset.
Go back to the first floor
and wait for further instructions.
- Yes, sir. Copy that.
- Copy that.
Everybody down! Right now!
Down, move, move, move!
Out of the way! Federal agents! Move!
Take a team to the northeast elevators.
I'll meet you up there.
Bourne's on his way up to you.
You took a long time to get here, Jason.
I know about Beirut.
I know what you did.
It all ends tonight.
Be a lot easier to do it right away.
You didn't come here for revenge.
You came here because
you know it's time to come in.
Your father created the program.
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.
And you did.
You always did.
That's why you volunteered.
I volunteered because
I thought our enemies killed him.
I volunteered because of a lie.
No, you volunteered because of who you are.
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,
and not David Webb.
Thirty-two kills, Jason.
Every one of them made a difference.
People all across this country
are safer because of what you did.
I'm trying to find another way.
And how's that working out for you?
You're never going to find any peace.
Not until you admit to yourself
who you really are.
It's time to come in, Jason.
It's time to come in.
I can't.
Not for you.
You were never here.
You don't have to go after him.
This can stop now.
You have a choice.
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.
Have your IDs ready, ladies and gentlemen.
Have your IDs ready!
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!
Stand in a line.
Las Vegas Police, ladies and gentlemen!
BearCat SWAT truck
and unmarked black Dodge Charger
stolen from the front of the Aria.
Pursuit in progress. Air support requested.
What was that ID?
Stop him! Block that road!
Oh, my God!
Fire!
Move out!
Move!
Next two units involved, identify.
This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles
have crashed into
the southeast entrance of the Riviera.
We have an armed suspect heading
into the storm drain south of the Riviera.
Aah!
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.
It's in your blood.
Mr. Kalloor!
Aaron! What were you
going to tell everyone at the convention?
What are you hiding, Aaron?
Easy.
Why did somebody try to assassinate you?
What's the cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream?
I think it would be inappropriate
to pass any comment at this stage,
but I look forward to
working with the authorities
to find out who was responsible.
And to getting back to Deep Dream,
where we can continue
our important work. Thank you.
Have you been lying to your users?
Sir.
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.
About Vegas.
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.
Unwise?
We're still trying to come up with
a narrative to explain what happened.
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.
On all of us.
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.
I know Aaron.
There are still moves we can make with him.
Tell me.
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.
People like Kalloor are shaping the future.
These are my people.
I know how to deal with him.
And what do you want?
When you appoint a new Agency Director,
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.
Someone
empowered by you.
What about Bourne?
You still think you can bring him in?
I have his trust.
After what we went through.
I'll bring him in.
I'm certain of it.
And if you can't?
Then he'll have to be put down.
It's an interesting proposal.
You can pull over here.
Of course, if you decide that you
don't need me, then that's not a problem.
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.
I brought you something.
It's a cast from your father's star,
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.
I'm sorry for what happened to you.
How you were treated.
But the people that did that are gone,
and things are changing at the Agency.
What is it you want?
I know you've always been a patriot.
That what happens to this country
matters to you.
We need you to help protect us.
Come back in.
And we'll work together.
Let me think about it.
How will I find you?
You still think you can bring him in?
I have his trust.
After what we went through.
I'll bring him in.
I'm certain of it.
And if you can't?
Then he'll have to be put down.
