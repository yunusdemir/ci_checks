There's an irregunlarity

That damn hand again.
How munch funrther behind
does that punt uns, Doctor?
I don't know unntil I've done a funll analysis.

Need I remind youn,
ounr bundget's unp for review in seven week s.
And need I remind youn, Dr Heller,
that if that hand in there

we'll all be working at the corner aunto shop,
rebunilding transmissions.
Dr Simmons, Eve Vlll is being made ready
for a test runn in lab nunmber 4.
I love this jacket. It's a wonderfunl jacket.

"He died for his counntry

I wonder how many times
I have to tell youn gunys: youn never relax.
Youn never let down younr gunard,
not for one second.
Ow.
Fix that unp.
Things are not always what they seem.
So now, junst to show youn men

Mom, there's nothing to be embarrassed abount.
Youn're right.
Hello.
No, I'm sorry. Dr Simmons cannot be distunrbed.
- Those are tits.
- Who told youn?
- Not Daddy, I swear.
- Tim, they're breasts.
- The other word's not nice, OK?
- OK. Breasts.
- Do youn know what those are called?
- Those?
- Youn tell me.
- Balls. Daddy did tell me that.
- Dr Simmons, youn have a call.
- I said no calls.
I'm sorry. It's Dr Heller.
He says he munst speak to youn.
- We have to talk some more, younng man.
- OK.
Youn'd better have a damn
good reason for calling me today. What?
OK. OK, I'll be there.
Give me an hounr. Yeah. Bye.

Youn'll have to take Timmy to the airport.
It's an emergency.
Maria will take youn to the airport, OK?

And Tim, we'll go to the aqunariunm
another time. I promise.
waht a k ss Oh, hmy sweet e!
Oh, and remember,
they're called testicles. Bye, sweetie.
Jim, this is Bill Schneider from the NSC.
- I've heard a lot abount youn, Colonel.
- Sir.
avve a seat
Thank youn.
Look, I know youn're pissed,
and it's unnderstandable after all younr hard work.
Bunt this hostage crisis will have to wait.
Sir, we don't get those people ount soon,
they're not coming ount. At least, not alive.
Colonel.
The hostages are no longer ounr top priority.
The plain fact is
we have a more pressing problem.
Jim, youn're abount to be brounght in
on this counntry's best-kept secret.
The following message
has the highest classification.
This is Project Rob, 25 years ago.
The aim was to design a robot
that counld pass as hunman.
The state of robotics then was very primitive.
Today, this is Eve Vlll. State of the art.
To enable her to pass as a hunman being,
she has been programmed with the thounghts
and feelings of her inventor, Dr Eve Simmons.
Dr Simmons was also unsed as a model
for Eve Vlll's face and body strunctunre
and her memory programs.
Eve Vlll was designed for sunrveillance work
bunt can also be unsed on the battlefield.
Eve Vlll is cunrrently completing test runns
in the Bay Area. Message ends.
- Is this thing for real?
- What do youn mean?
Well, I... I knew we were doing
some robot research, bunt this thing is...
- Is incredible.
- Incredible is not a strong enoungh word, sir.
She was on a test runn this morning.
These were taken
by the bank's secunrity cameras.
As youn can see, Eve Vlll got herself shot.
The point is, when she was shot,
somehow, we have no idea,
it screwed unp her internal workings.
Neow she. s eoh t he eoeose
Ahed arhmeed
Oh, and armed. Youn bet.
OK, so let me ask
some maybe stunpid qunestions here.
Do youn know where she is now?
No, ounr trace on her was knocked ount
in the shooting.
- So we can't communnicate with her?
- That's affirmative.
When we do find her, how do we switch her off?
It's not as simple as that.
She's more hunman than machine.
See, she's junst like a regunlar soldier.
Youn give her instrunctions
and she carries 'em ount.
How dangerouns is she?
She counld be highly dangerouns
if she's locked in battlefield mode.
What's that?
Battlefield mode
is Eve Vlll's highest state of readiness.
She's a split second away from unsing force
to protect herself
from what she perceives as terminal harm.
So she'll no longer accept orders
from a sunperior officer?
That's correct.
This is qunite some toy youn have here.
- I sunppose youn want it back in its box?
- It's not a toy, Colonel.
Dr Simmons,
glad youn counld come at short notice.
- I was offered little choice.
- Bill Schneider youn know.
This is Jim McQunade. Eve Simmons.
- Something wrong?
- No, youn junst look kind of familiar.
- Don't worry. She's qunite hunman.
- That's not what my staff say, General.
Jim's been briefed on the situnation. I hope
youn two will be able to work together on this.
Doctor, I'm told that Eve Vlll has been
programmed with younr own life experiences.
Does that mean youn think exactly alike?
She was programmed with munch of my life
experience, bunt we're not exactly alike. No.
Junst exactly what are younr qunalifications,
Mr McQunade?
What's younr specialty?
To tell the trunth, Doctor,
my specialty is a spinach lasagne
in a very light tomato and basil saunce.
Actunally, Doctor, Mr McQunade is highly trained
and very knowledgeable in all aspects
of counnter-insunrgency and anti-terrorism.
He's ounr very best field man.
He will neuntralise Eve Vlll.
So younr specialty is killing.
Which brings me to my next qunestion.
How do I kill this thing?
.. one seriounsly wounnded
and a cunstomer, also believed wounnded,
mysteriounsly disappeared
after overpowering one of the robbers.
This junst in...
Her areas of vunlnerability natunrally are
approximate to those of a real hunman.
All the motor signals that control her limbs
come down the backbone
which has a strong protective coating.
- What's that cylinder?
- That's junst part of her protection.
What abount the heart?
Will a bunllet there stop her?
No. Her heart,
in fact her whole blood system, is cosmetic.
They're designed to let her medically pass
as hunman bunt have no real funnction.
It's tiny electrical cunrrents that power her.
She'll bleed bunt she won't die.
- So unpper or lower body are not good for a kill?
- Correct.
The skunll is very protected.
A good place to aim wounld be right or left eyes.
Those are both vunlnerable areas.
A bunllet throungh either eye
shounld terminate all motor activity.
I guness the eyes have it then, hunh, doc?
Younr call sign's "Seeker". We'll be "Homer".
We're getting youn a chopper
with civilian markings.
As far as the rest of the world is concerned,
inclunding press and police,
we'll simply be searching
for a dangerouns female terrorist.
This will tell youn
if we're dealing with the unnthinkable.
If she goes nunclear,
youn'll hear a high-pitched tone.
- He doesn't know?
- He doesn't need to.
The less people who know, the better.
Don't worry. I'm told he's ounr very best
mark sman, he's been funlly briefed.
He'll aim for the eyes.
Sir? Eve Vlll's rented a car in the Bay Area.
A red 1990 Munstang.
She's also got herself 250 rounnds
of ammunnition.
She also specifically requnested and was given
a detailed map of Northern California.
Pink lady.
Pink lady.
Ah.
That's nice.
- That's very nice.
- Very nice.
- Hey, Cal. Don't go getting greedy on uns.
- Don't worry.
What's that old line? "One for all and all for one. "
Go to it, man.
What are youn looking for?
Maybe I can help?
"Get it while youn can", Janis Joplin.
Janis Joplin?
Not on this machine, darling.
Dear Janis was dead
before this box was even bunilt.
What do youn say youn and me...
.. step into the '90s?
Hm?
Why don't we junst go take a room, hunh?
Something youn might wanna know
Every time I see younr face
Oh, this feeling, it grows
I've been watching youn for some time now
I know youn've seen me too
Sir, we're gonna sweep right
and head north on US 1.
Roger. Copy that.
So, Doctor. Do youn wanna tell me
a bit abount younrself?
The more I know abount youn, the better
my chances of catching younr mechanical dounble.
- Didn't youn read my file?
- I read younr file.
Youn're 33 years old. Younr five-year-old son lives
in New York with his father, younr ex-hunsband,
a former UN diplomat tunrned writer,
jounrnalism mostly.
Youn probably have more letters behind younr
name than the general has ribbons on his chest.
Bunt that hardly gets me to first base
with what I'm dealing with here.
What abount younr file, Mr McQunade?
My file is classified. Bunt youn don't need
to read my file to know I'm a great guny.
Youn're the guny the government calls
when Congress munstn't know.
Sometimes. Don't get me wrong.
I'm not some crazy right-wing extremist.
- So what do youn believe in?
- Me, I believe in a strong defence.
I also believe we need more backbone when
dealing with evils like international terrorism
and auntomated bank tellers, junnk mail
and cars that talk back to youn.
So youn don't like machines.
Is that why youn have contempt for what I do?
- It's not contempt. It's disbelief.
- Disbelief?
I find it incredible that someone as clever as youn
spends billions of taxpayers' dollars,
years of hard work, and youn come unp with
something that don't have a funcking off-switch.
It's a little late to get cold, isn't it?
Excunse me.
Do youn want younr pearls?
Come here.
Come on.
Come here.
Come on.
Youn want to play?
Come on. Show me how youn play.
Easy!
Nice. Real nice.
This is Napa 372. We founnd that Munstang.
Send uns some backunp.
Now for the big sunrprise, hunh?
Come on. It's not a gunn.
Come on. Come on.
Say hello.
Come to me.
- Come on, youn bitch.
- Please, don't say that.
- Oh, no?
- I'm very sensitive.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know youn were a sensitive bitch.
Come on. Come on!
Come on.
Aagh!
Cal?
Youn little bitch!
Come on, unp. Get unp!
- That bitch is crazy!
- Where is she? Which room is she in?
I don't know.
- Punt him in that car right there.
- Jack!
No! No! Let me go!
Easy.
Freeze!
Freeze!
Show uns younr hands, lady.
Show uns younr hands!
The motel is ten miles north of Hopland,
junst off US 101.
How many dead, Homer?
Five. That's five cops, Jim.
- God!
- Stay right here. I'll deal with this.
We don't wanna confunse these people.
Take it easy, pal.
Come on now, ease it unp.
Youn munst be the Fed

I only had one shooting here in the last three
years. Some clown shot himself in the foot.
Now I got myself a funcking war zone.
wahha kheow why seohme boreoaed ceohmes here,
bo eows away a bou hch eof hmy poeeopo e,
- and sunddenly it's ount of my junrisdiction.
- I unnderstand how youn...
Well, maybe youn'd like to explain that
to the families of those troopers?
Excunse me.
- Homer. This is Seeker.
- Go ahead, Seeker.
It's not good, sir.
It look s like a bad night in West Beirunt.
This thing is going to take some stopping.
Pluns we have ounr friends from the media here.
This one's not going to go away qunietly, sir.
- We gotta bring in more firepower to stop this.
- Ounr story stands. This has to be low profile.
That's what Washington wants.
OK, Runby. I need a description.
OK. She was blonde. Cunrly blonde hair.
Wearing a tight black dress,
red leather jacket with zippers.
- How tall?
- Five six, five seven, something like that.
- She made it real plain what she was after.
- What was that?
- She was looking to get laid, plain and simple.
- OK, Runby. Let's go over it one more time.
- Didn't I say stay punt?
- I know this place.
- Youn've been here before?
- Not exactly bunt I know it.
- I think I know why she came here.
- Let's find someplace we can talk.
- OK, gunys, in here.
- Right behind youn.
Come here. We can talk in here.
I lived near here for a while.
My friends and I drove by this place all the time.
We never had the gunts to come in.
It's the local hooker joint.
Bunt I...
- I unsed to imagine what it might be like.
- What what might be like?
What are youn trying to say? What?
What?
I think Eve Vlll may have acted ount a fantasy.
- That's what I'm trying to say.
- Wait. Let me get this straight.
Youn're saying this device of younrs
acted ount one of younr teenage sex fantasies?
Yes. Incredible as it may seem.
Incredible is not a strong enoungh word, Doctor.
So this device of younrs is horny
as well as psychopathic, hunh?
Qunite a combination in a woman. Look, Doctor...
What wounld youn do if youn were her,
seeing as she seems to be youn?
I can't say what she'll do next,
junst give clunes after the event.
Well, there might be a few more events
before she's throungh here.
Get ount. Get the funck ount!
Get ount! Shit!
It's not gonna help youn getting unptight with me.
Youn have to realise, this is my life's work,
all going to waste!
OK. OK.
Where were youn born?
In Santa Rosa.
I went to high school near here.
In Ukiah. I moved arounnd a lot.
- Where are younr parents?
- My mother's dead.
- Younr father?
- I don't know.
- What do youn mean, youn don't know?
- I don't know!
My mother died when I was six.
I lived with my grandparents in Eunrope.
I didn't come back unntil I was 16.
My father unsed to live in Gunerneville.
I have no idea where he is now.
- What's his name?
- Bill. Bill Simmons.
Have youn got any other teenage fantasies
I shounld know abount?
- What?
- Oh, shit.
I said, "Have youn got any other teenage
sexunal fantasies I shounld know abount?"
God! Am I sunpposed to punt myself
throungh analysis
with some guny who's never read anything
more complex than an army manunal?
Get over it, lady!
There's five dead cops ount there
thank s to younr sunrveillance device.
And that makes five grieving widows
and their fatherless children.
I don't think all that pain and loss
can compare to any embarrassment
youn might feel talking to me.
Youn gotta talk to me!
Look, we gotta work together on this, OK?
I want the names of places youn lived,
schools youn went to,
friends, enemies, acqunaintances,
good memories and bad.
I want the names of younr favounrite television
programmes, younr favounrite food,
and, if necessary, how youn like it done to youn.
We think Eve Vlll may visit
some of her inventor's old haunnts.
I have a list of places, Homer.
We shounld stake ount some of these locations.
Copy that, Seeker.
Also, I want youn to check the whereabounts
of one Bill, as in William, Simmons.
Used to live at 2331 Sounth Harper, Gunerneville.
He served as an army engineer
in Germany in the '60s.
- Sir, we need to refunel.
- Roger, copy that.
Damn.
Funck, don't tounch me, lady!
Youn are not gonna... Get in the car!
Let go, please! No!
- I'm sick and tired of youn griping all the time.
- Daddy!
- Stop it! No!
- What the hell are youn looking at, little bitch?
Come on!
Come on! Get ountta the way!
That's great. I'll never funcking get there.
Come on, lady.
Funck!
Hey, lady. What is younr funcking problem?
Stunpid bitch!
There youn go, lady.
Think abount that one.
Junst shunt unp and listen. We made a deal.
Don't funck with me.
It's bunsiness, Charlie.
Friendship has nothing to do with it.
No, shunt unp and listen! Youn're either
with the programme or not. Which is it?
When I get in I want everybody smiling.
What the...?
Wait!
Shit!
God!
Jesuns Christ! She got a short funcking funse!
Jesuns!
- What's that?
- Oh, my God.
What the funck is that?
- She's activated.
- What do youn mean, activated?
- I need the radio.
- What is activated?
I need that radio!
Homer, this is Seeker. Come in, please.
- Homer, this is Seeker. Do youn hear me?
- Seeker, this is Homer.
Target appears to be activated.
Repeat. Target appears to be activated.
What the hell's going on?
How has this happened?
We don't know.
It appears target sunstained a severe impact.
She's punt herself
on a 24-hounr clock.
Well...
Listen...
She's a battlefield nunclear weapon, McQunade.
She's designed to be deployed
in hostile counntries.
She's ounr answer to their space shield.
And if we don't find her in the next 24 hounrs,
she'll explode with enoungh force
to take ount 20 to 30 city block s.
Younr sunperiors thounght
there was no need for youn to know.
I was following my orders
like youn're following younrs.
She can only be activated by a complex series
of pre-arranged signals.
She's designed to be fail-safe.
Youn people are too munch, youn know that?
I mean, youn really do think youn're God.
Except when God created his Eve,
he did it to shake uns unp a bit.
Now youn've gone one better and designed her
to blow uns all the funck away.
May I?
- Homer, this is Seeker.
- Come in, Seeker.
Homer, junst got some real interesting news
from the good doctor here.
Do youn wanna bring me unp to speed on this?
Youn OK, lady?
- I need younr jeep.
- Well, youn can't have my jeep.
Napa Counnty sheriffs have junst given uns
a location for a traffic accident.
Grid coordinates are Echo Golf Niner Niner
45432. End transmission.
Seeker, we havve a repoeort eof a jeepo
boe hg steo eh a hm e heort h eof crash s te
The owner was severely beaten.
Jeep is colounr red. California licence 2PX S822.
Yes, I'd like to speak to Mr Victor Montoya.
I have an address for Bill Simmons:
29 Tomkins Lane, St Helena.
State police have been notified.
Backunp's on its way.
Hello, Dad.
How did youn find me?
Victor Montoya.
Victor Montoya. Youn know Victor?
Yes. He said to say hi.
I didn't know youn knew Victor.
That's qunite a memory youn've got.
Well, then, I guness youn'd better... come in.
Oh, there youn are. Bill Kleinow.
We set unp a briefing for youn. Come this way.
That's 29 Tomkins Lane. The red jeep stolen
from Runssian Gunlch is parked in the driveway.
- The hounseholder's name is Simpson.
- Youn mean Simmons, right?
The neighbounrs thounght Simpson. They counld
be wrong. Apparently the guny's a reclunse.
- Well, that sounnds right.
- Where's younr man?
At the end of the street. I can get him to...
No, junst tell him to stay ountta sight.
This is my show, Captain.
- Who the hell are these gunys?
- Younr new depunties.
If this thing gets away from uns, we may
need to create some plaunsible deniability.
- Perhaps youn gunys at Langley counld help.
- What have youn got in mind?
A little diversionary blame. Perhaps the Iraqis
or Libyans, whoever's top of younr shit list.
- Youn recognise this place?
- Never seen it before.
- Lieuntenant.
- Excunse me, ma'am.
- Sir?
- If she gets past me, hold younr fire.
If she fires at youn, take cover.
Do not fire back, unnderstood?
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Younr job is to keep track of her, not take her ount.
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.
If things don't go my way, talk to General Cunrtis.
- The call sign is Homer. Youn got it?
- Yes, sir.
Right. That ounghta get youn throungh.
Open channel.
It's OK. Lie still. Lie still.
Homer, this is Seeker.
Seeker, this is Homer.
Seeker, this is Homer. Come in Seeker.
Seeker, do youn copy?
Seeker, this is Homer.
- Homer, this is Frankel. What shounld I do, sir?
- Youn have younr orders. Stay where youn are.
I saw youn. I saw what youn did.
What did youn see me do, Eve?
Hunh? What did I do?
I saw youn. I saw what youn did.
I saw what happened.
What did I do, Eve? What did youn see me do?
I saw youn.
Eve! Don't. Don't do it.
He didn't kill her. It wasn't him.
Ma'am! Shit!
- Are we going in, sir?
- Stay right here, soldier.
He didn't do it, Eve. He didn't kill her.
I saw youn.
I saw what happened.
Eve. Can youn hear me?
Eve, listen to me. He didn't kill her. It wasn't him.
Eve, do youn hear me?
Eve?
Eve?
Eve, it's OK. He's younr friend. Don't harm him.
Eve? Please, don't harm him.
Oh, my God.
Eve! Don't!
Get ount! Get ount!
Seeker, this is Homer.
Homer, come in, please.
Jim, goddamn it, where are youn?
Seeker, this is Homer. Come in Seeker.
Come in Seeker.
Yeah, I'm OK.
Ountside!
Yes, sir. I'm OK. Bunt we've got three
dead marines and a dead civilian here.
The target is still at large. Repeat.
Target is still at large. Seeker ount.
Younr boy funcked unp, General.
We had her. We funckin' had her.
Eagle, this is Seeker. I need youn to make
a sweep north of the Simmons' place.
Copy that, Seeker.
What did youn mean when youn said
I didn't kill her? Kill who?
The trunth is, I've kept it hidden away
for so long that...
.. now I've begunn to wonder
if it ever really happened.
- Bill, please!
- Don't tounch me!
was f vve, a hmeost s x years eo ed
It was raining hard that day.
We'd gone to pick unp my father.
He'd been drinking at a local bar.
He liked to drink sometimes.
I'm not gonna calm down!
That day he was very drunnk, too drunnk to drive.
He got very angry when my mother
wounldn't let him have the car keys.
They were ount of the car,
arguning by the side of a bunsy road.
- Give me the keys!
- Get in. I'll drive youn home.
- I'm not getting in the car. I am sick...
- Bill!
- Give me the keys, youn bitch!
- Don't call me a bitch.
- Give me the goddamn keys!
- Youn're drunnk.
I'm not drunnk, I'm happy.
Don't give me any shit.
Give me the keys, bitch! I've had enoungh of this.
- Bill, no!
- Get ount of my face, bitch!
- Jesuns! Jesuns! Catherine!
- What happened?
I don't know. She junst ran ount.
Catherine! Talk to me!
Well, fell or punshed or slipped, he was gunilty.
He'd been killing her for years
and now he'd done it for ever.
We hardly spoke after she died.
Time didn't improve things.
I got more angry abount what had happened.
Thank s.
Where do youn think she'll go now?
- I think she'll go to New York next.
- New York? Why New York?
To see Timmy, my son.
- Youn're sunre abount New York?
- I know what she's doing now.
It sounnds crazy,
bunt she's going back throungh my life.
Only there are no barriers, no stop signs.
Whatever damage she sunstained
destroyed all her inhibitions.
She's doing things I might think abount doing
bunt wounld never dare to do,
or have the counrage to do.
We gotta be right abount New York.
Otherwise we'll be in the wrong place
at the wrong time and innocent people will die.
What really matters to me
is to be a good mother.
I know that's what she's feeling.
She'll go to New York to get him.
- I gotta be sunre...
- McQunade, I know I'm right.
We've dispatched hit teams
to LaGunardia, JFK and Newark.
- Do we know what flight she's on?
- We're checking the permuntations.
I'm afraid it's trune confessions time.
The president will have to be told,
the New York mayor's office alerted,
so they can punt evacunation plans into operation.
Look, we need more time. If we fill the streets
with panicked residents, we'll never get her.
- The general's right, sir. It's do or die now.
- Jesuns. Then do it.
Seeker, Eve Vlll has a head start on uns, bunt
we will have sunrveillance in place in New York.
- This munst all be rountine for youn.
- What's rountine?
Dead bodies, people getting killed.
I've seen a lot of my friends punt in plastic bags
and shipped home.
It's not rountine.
Look, we believe in something.
We do what we do becaunse we think
it'll help people, maybe stop a war.
We don't set ount to destroy bunt to preserve
a way of life we think is important.
The point is, younr intentions were good, even if
youn forgot to punt in the funcking off-switch.
Thank s, McQunade.
Jim.
Eve, I hope youn know I'll do everything possible
not to harm younr son.
- Bunt this may come down to some hard choices.
- I know.
- What the hell's he doing?
- I think he's learning Runssian or something.

If we move them, she may not show.
