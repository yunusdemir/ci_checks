I almost fell!
I just picked them up.
I found them here.
Take them off.
I saw them first.
They're mine.
Hey, I was waiting here for 30 minutes.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I was watching you from the other side.
I was playing with you.
- Don't lie!
- You counted to four just now. No?
But still, I found them first!
- I found them first!
- Let go!
Hey!
Hey!
Choi Young-mi, is that you?
You're playing a joke on me, huh?
<i>THE RED SHOES</i>
Tae-soo, let's eat.
Honey.
Wow. Wonderful, Tae-soo!
Come here, darling.
- Whose baby girl are you, Tae-soo?
- Daddy's.
Dance once more.
Tae-soo!
It's still raw.
I wanna wear my red shoes!
- Just once for today.
- No!
Tae-soo, please stop this.
Mommy's late.
I wanna wear my red shoes!
Take Tae-soo to her private lessons.
At two today.
Can't you do it just for once today?
Tae-soo's shoes are here.
Bring them to her.
Aren't you too old to like red?
It doesn't suit you.
Train Tae-soo.
She's old enough
to go to her lessons alone.
Keep an eye on her from behind.
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo didn't come today.
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Like it?
These shoes look better on you.
Mom, I'm hungry.
Let's go home.
Okay.
Tae-soo, wanna sleep
next to mommy tonight?
- Why?
- Just because.
Mommy wants to sleep with Tae-soo.
Mommy will read you a fairy tale, okay?
So that Tae-soo
won't have any scary dreams.
But it's more fun
when daddy reads it to me.
Please come inside.
This is the living room.
I'll replace that for you.
And over here is the kitchen.
- Where's the bathroom?
- Ah, yes. The toilet's this way.
- Have anywhere else available?
- Pardon?
Well,
you can't find a place this big
with the money you're offering.
Plus, the subway's close to here.
You old hag!
I told you not to come in here!
I should run you out of the basement, too.
She lives in the basement.
She's not a bad person though.
She's a bit deranged.
Hurry and come out.
So pretty...
Do you like it, Tae-soo?
Han Tae-soo!
I don't mind you practicing,
but don't run up and down like that.
- Still not done?
- The switch!
Lots of things are clogged up in there.
Stuff that you want.
Like Tae-soo, money,
glamorous shoes.
But still, there's no husband.
Your wound's okay now,
but your eyes have gone bad with age.
What are you talking about?
No way.
- I must be temporarily near-sighted.
- Probably so.
It's all because of that bastard.
Women who have good jobs
should stay single like me.
Kim Mi-hee.
He's Tae-soo's father, not "bastard".
And never mention that bastard
in front of me again.
So when will your new clinic open?
Construction started today,
so about three weeks
until the interior's done.
So I was wondering...
Do you need money?
I see you didn't get enough alimony.
It's that self-pride of yours
that will do you wrong, you know.
If a divorced woman raises her kid
alone and even has no money,
it's pitiful, I tell you.
Marketing for your eye clinic?
That was corny.
My name's Cho In-chul.
I'm the interior designer.
I just moved in.
It's okay if I stay here
till the construction's done, right?
Are you doing it all yourself?
How long will it take?
When I get the vibe, about two weeks?
But I can't guarantee it.
What's "vibe"?
A "feel".
I'm in a bit of a hurry,
so can't it be any faster?
Slipping a brush into someone's hand,
and asking for art immediately
would be irresponsible.
Don't worry so much.
I'll start as soon as I get the feel.
Also, I noticed that the budget is low.
It's not that I'm complaining.
It's just that I'll have
to brainstorm more.
Are you always this slimy?
No. There's no
particular problem.
Can you just send me someone else?
Then please do it soon, thanks.
Far-sighted due to age?
Mommy.
You bought new shoes again?
No.
- I wanna try them on, too.
- You can't!
Mommy, I hate you!
Your feet are ugly!
How can you wear these?
You could hurt your ankles
and not dance again.
Let's hurry to bed.
Lift up your chins and turn.
And to the left.
One, two, three, plie.
Pas plie, one.
Turn, and one, two,
three, four, go back.
Plie. The opposite way.
And turn and turn.
Look ahead. Towards me.
One, jump, three, four.
Go back and run.
Tae-soo, give it to Gyu-won.
Gyu-won! Next person
come to the front.
Quickly.
What do you think?
Do you like it?
So then, do I keep the job?
I heard that you couldn't work with me.
Has your "vibe" come?
Anyway, do you eat
with your left hand or right?
I need to know which hand you'll use
in order to arrange things.
- I'm left-handed.
- You must've found things uncomfortable.
I'll keep in mind for the design
that you're a lefty.
Anyway, will you manage
by eating just that?
What's wrong with ramen noodles?
I have a rice roll, too.
I'm sorry if I'm being rude,
but you're not homeless, right?
I have a house and I lived with a woman.
But we're broken up now.
Now I don't have anyone
waiting at home for me.
I have no complaints
about living like this.
Will your husband be upset
if I asked you to cook for me?
I'm not implying anything.
Just that I miss homemade cooking.
I have to go.
I have to meet my daughter.
Wait!
What are you doing?
Please stop it.
It's image association.
That's the examination room.
Hold still.
This is the waiting room.
- We're done for today.
- Good work everyone.
- Don't drink too much tonight.
- Okay!
And for over here, purple would be nice.
A light purple is easy on the eyes
for an eye clinic.
Also, I did some work on the logo design.
What? Is there something
on my face?
Now I see your face more clearly.
My eyes have gotten better.
Would you like to come over for dinner?
I'm inviting you.
Did you get your husband's permission?
I live alone with my daughter.
I'm divorced.
Think you're being tested?
There's no need to worry.
It's delicious.
Tae-soo!
What's wrong with you?
Dad was here during the day.
- Tae-soo, go to your room.
- Mommy.
Now! Didn't you hear me?
No, every time I bring up dad,
you get mad.
- That's because it's a lie.
- It's not a lie!
- Dad really came!
- Tae-soo!
You know daddy went far away.
So how could he come here?
He doesn't even know that we live here.
You know I hate it when you lie.
I hate it, too!
You being with this guy!
Daddy will hate it, too!
I hate this guy, too!
Tae-soo must've been
very close to her father.
She seems to miss him a lot.
I'm sorry.
Lost the other pair?
- These would look good on you.
- You really think it would?
Sung-joon! Sung-joon!
Sung-joon!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
Where's Sung-joon?
Where the hell is he?
- What the hell are you doing?
- Let go! Move!
Hand Sung-joon over.
Hand him over now!
Where did you hide him?
Hurry and hand him over!
- Stop it!
- Let go of me!
How funny.
I guess you do have a heart.
Know how lonely Sung-joon was
because of you?
Hand Sung-joon over.
Hand him over!
That's enough!
Get out!
There's no use in hiding him!
I stole him from you.
- Get out!
- Let go!
He's mine now!
Are you okay?
Can you please go?
I hate it, too.
You being with this guy.
Daddy will hate it, too.
I hate this guy, too.
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, no!
Don't, Tae-soo.
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, what's wrong?
Tae-soo, what's wrong with you?
Okay, I'm sorry about yelling
at you yesterday. Satisfied now?
So hand them over right now!
I'm late!
- They're mommy's!
- Those red shoes aren't yours!
If you keep this up, I'll get very angry!
Not going to your lessons?
Would you treat me to dinner
if I asked you to?
You said these would look
good on me, remember?
Has your vibe come?
The food's good, but the restaurant's
ambience was a bit stuffy.
I overdid it, of course.
Since I was too ambitious.
I wanted to give it my all.
Like my first love experience.
That was the first place I worked on.
Then where's your favorite?
The place you worked on
that you like the most?
- You'll be disappointed though.
- But I'm curious.
Then do you want to see it?
Have a seat wherever you like.
Don't need to take off your shoes.
Is it still under construction?
No, this is it.
Who's this?
It's not me, is it?
It's the girl I lived with.
My ex-girlfriend.
Those shoes look good on you.
They don't look good
on just anyone, you know.
But, why are they so familiar?
I swear I've seen them somewhere before.
Want to sleep over?
Oh right, your daughter.
Are you mad that I'm too forward?
- What in the world did I do wrong?
- I told you not to wear them!
- But they're mommy's.
- No, they're mine now!
Don't touch them!
Tae-soo. Tae-soo!
- Give them to me! They're mommy's.
- They're mine now!
- They're mommy's.
- They're mine now!
- Be a good girl.
- No!
- Give them here! Listen to me!
- No!
- No!
- Give them to me!
- No!
- I told you they're mommy's.
- No! They're mine!
- What's wrong with you?
- They're mine!
- Fight quietly, will you?
The neighbors will call the police.
Tae-soo, present!
Try to act your age with the kid.
You're amazing.
I see you're keeping up your hobby.
Did you put on make-up?
- What brings you here at this hour?
- Aren't I always invited?
Can't make time during the day.
Always busy as hell.
This place is tiny.
How could you have stooped down this far?
Isn't it uncomfortable?
I have no problem managing.
And it doesn't need to be big
for two people.
Have some self-esteem
only when you need it.
Don't be like that even to me.
Anyway, that bastard...
Has Tae-soo's father been here?
- No.
- Does he know that you live here?
Anyway, what was that?
- What?
- What Tae-soo was hugging.
Weren't you two fighting over that?
The color was very unique.
What brand is that one?
- Subway.
- Subway?
Subway shopping center?
I picked them up, actually.
They seemed to have no owner.
- They seemed to have no owner.
- Oh, sorry. I'll wash up first.
- Okay.
- Or help yourself to some tea first.
Can't I wear them just once?
Just once.
Want money?
How much will it take?
Why aren't you listening to me?
I'm gonna wear it just once.
Just once!
What do you mean I stole it?
I'm just borrowing it for a sec.
Hurt?
She got hurt just because of that?
She'll get over it soon.
Okay, I'll return it.
Come over tomorrow night.
I'll be waiting with my hands up.
By the way,
know how great I feel right now?
I feel so much younger
with these shoes on.
My feet feel like dancing on their own.
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is not available.</i>
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>
Kim Mi-hee! You could ruin our
mother-daughter relationship.
You better call me fast
before I report you.
You look much different from yesterday.
- I do?
- Why didn't you wear them today?
What is it?
It's them, right?
The shoes you wore.
They're different from my shoes.
Did I make a mistake then?
These shoes aren't the only
ones in this world.
Right.
Hello?
What?
You're the murderer, aren't you?
Detective Lee, quiet them down, will you?
Detective Bak, I told you to shut them up!
Some high school girl was looking
for her dead friend's shoes.
She said it was hers.
But there weren't any shoes
at the murder site.
So her legs were cut off, too?
Well, in the end they were.
So my friend wasn't wearing
anything on her feet?
I told you she had no shoes on!
Anyway, why is everyone
looking for those damn shoes?
Lady, you seem to know something.
What are you talking about?
What the hell?
Mister. Mister.
Call an ambulance right away!
Hold on!
You need to be authorized
to see those pictures.
The husband needs to sign here.
<i>Husband: Han Sung-joon</i>
Husband?
She wasn't divorced?
Who brought you those shoes,
Tae-soo?
Give them to me. Hurry.
They aren't yours, and mine neither.
Then whose are they?
I need them.
I can't dance without them.
Tae-soo, you can't wear these.
- Give them to me.
- No! No!
- Tae-soo!
- No!
Now!
Mommy.
Tae-soo.
No, Tae-soo. Take them off.
Hurry and take them off.
No, Tae-soo!
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo!
- How is she?
- I examined her thoroughly,
but her body is fine.
Her brain waves and pulse rate
are normal, but she won't wake up.
Sun-jae, are you okay?
Tae-soo! Open your eyes!
It's mommy!
- Tae-soo, what happened to you?
- Please calm down, Sun-jae.
- Tae-soo, it's mommy!
- Sun-jae! Sun-jae!
Let go of me! Let go!
- Tae-soo, my sweetie, what happened?
- Please calm down.
Your child is fine. We just need to wait.
She'll turn out fine, so calm down.
It's mommy. Open your eyes.
Tae-soo, please open your eyes.
Tae-soo, it's okay now.
Everything will be okay.
I'm sure of it.
These...
I swear that Mi-hee took them.
Your friend is dead.
And these shoes...
You kept clenching on to them
ever since you came to the hospital.
This is insane. It's not me.
Who the hell brought them?
Who? Who?
Why?
Why do they keep coming
to Tae-soo?
I'm the one who first picked them up.
I wore them, too.
Why hasn't anything happened to me?
You...
- I can't trust you.
- What?
How'd you come to the hospital?
Who called you?
What are you talking about?
You called me, remember?
Well, to be exact,
you called and then hung up.
Where'd you get this picture?
The girl in this picture
Who the hell is she?
I tore it from a magazine.
Is that so wrong?
I'm asking you who she is!
Who is she? Who?
Who is she, damn it?
Tell me!
You really don't know who she is?
It's an ad made by some company.
Her picture is all over the city.
I'm telling you
that I don't know who she is!
How many times do I need to repeat it?
I can't get any work done
because of these calls!
This is driving me nuts!
How can an ad agency not know their model?
What?
Please go.
I'm sorry.
It's really important to us.
If it's an ad campaign that big,
someone should know who she is.
I beg you.
Know how many calls I got today
because of this one girl?
This picture is over 60 years old.
That is, to be exact...
The picture came out in 1944.
One of our staff found it
by chance on the Internet.
- So what did you want to know?
- This picture... Who took it?
You can find out on the Internet.
Hold on.
As you can see, this is all that we know.
It's being passed around on the Internet.
<i>A dance composer named Jung Ha-sub took
his dancer's picture. He died at 31.</i>
I told the police everything.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Wait!
Are these them?
<i>Bloody Wedding</i>
<i>Mystery Surrounding Keiko's Death</i>
I picked up those shoes.
And my friend took them from me.
I won't die. My daughter will.
<i>What are you talking about?</i>
<i>Talk clearly.</i>
The friend of that girl
who had her feet cut off...
She was wearing those shoes like me,
but nothing happened to her.
All she did was wear the red shoes.
And her friend
took those shoes away from her.
<i>What about your daughter,</i>
<i>Tae-soo?</i>
She took them away from me.
And my dead friend, Mi-hee,
took them from my daughter.
I'm so angry.
If I hadn't picked up those shoes...
Mi-hee's death and Tae-soo...
It's all my fault!
<i>Stay calm.</i>
<i>Where are you? I'll go to you.</i>
Here's something interesting.
Jung Ha-sub's dance hall
was at Goksung station back then.
Your house is at that very spot.
Jung Ha-sub, Keiko,
and the girl in the ad.
If one of these girls
were Jung Ha-sub's mistress...
How come guys only think that way?
Look, no emotion is more fatal
than an obsessed love.
Didn't you want to kill that woman
who slept with your husband?
What did you say?
I mean,
that kind of emotion
is strong enough to kill someone.
- Don't force any reason.
- Be honest.
Just tell me how you felt!
I know you're upset by your husband,
but you can't avoid it!
Why are you bringing him up
all of a sudden?
You should call him
after what happened to Tae-soo.
- Your husband should know, too!
- Stop it!
- She's his daughter, too!
- I said stop it!
You repress yourself in a weird way
and then change frighteningly.
When your husband is an issue,
you're not yourself at all!
What do you know?
Think you know all about me
after you slept with me once?
Watch what you say to me!
Shut the hell up!
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo?
Tae-soo. Tae-soo. Tae-soo...
Tae-soo...
Hunchback...
- The old woman.
- What's wrong?
Hurry, I need to check something.
You.
You know what these are, right?
I don't know.
I don't know a thing. Right?
Look, someone's life is at stake.
Tell us what you know.
You shouldn't have worn
something that pretty without asking.
Look here.
Tell us. Please tell us.
Hurry and return them.
Or else, you'll die like her.
To whom?
How do I return them?
- I don't know.
- Tell me!
- Hurry and tell me!
- I don't know!
Wait!
You know something for sure, right?
Tell me! Tell me now!
Hurry and tell me!
Stop it! Please stop!
Gyung-soon.
The shoes were definitely Oki's.
- Who's Gyung-soon?
- Keiko.
The MP Chief.
The Pro-Japanese Party's daughter.
Who is this Oki?
And why did Keiko die like that?
Tell me. Tell me everything.
Tell me exactly what you know!
Tell me now!
Tell me now! Tell me!
Tell me!
- Sun-jae.
- Tae-soo?
Sun-jae.
- Sun-jae.
- Tae-soo.
- Tae-soo?
- Sun-jae.
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.
Tae-soo.
Did a woman just leave here?
Why did you do it?
To forget about you.
What did you say?
Did you hit me because you love me?
Or because you hate
that I was stolen from you?
I'm scared of you.
What are you talking about?
Tae-soo gave it to me.
She said that her father came.
But you wouldn't believe her,
- so if I delivered...
- That's a lie!
I told you that he's not here.
Then where is he?
You should know!
Since you're not divorced yet.
No airport record of your husband
leaving this country.
And you're not divorced on paper.
What the hell are you holding back?
You're being out of line.
Know what Tae-soo said?
She said that daddy's cold.
And he must be taken out.
I don't know what you're saying.
But let's stop seeing each other.
I see you're a bit surprised.
Pretending to be refined,
clean, and unselfish.
But the real you
is a total hypocrite, a horny bitch.
Why are you doing this?
I have the right to know.
Others may not have to, but I must!
Why?
Don't you know why?
I want to know everything about you.
I don't care what you did.
So tell me.
Tell me with your very own lips!
You're right.
My daughter.
Lied to you.
My husband can't come.
You've guessed it yourself.
About what could've happened to him.
Tell me it's not true.
I'd rather hear some other excuse.
Tell me.
- Tell me where you got this from?
- From daddy.
Tae-soo.
Mommy loves Tae-soo very much.
But mommy really hates
when Tae-soo lies.
It's not a lie!
Daddy really came!
He said he's too cold and to take him out!
Don't lie to me!
I told you that daddy couldn't
come here. How can he?
I told you he can't come here,
so how could he?
How can he?
Why did you lie?
Why did you lie?
Mommy. Mommy.
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, I'm sorry.
Mommy was wrong.
Tae-soo. Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, mommy was wrong.
I was wrong.
Mommy was wrong.
But mommy
really hates when Tae-soo lies.
Mommy, I'm scared! Stop it!
Mommy, what's wrong with you?
- Tell me. Where did you find it?
- I'm scared!
- Tell me! Tell me!
- Mommy, I'm scared!
- Mommy, I'm scared! Help me!
- Where did you get it? Tell me!
Mommy, Help me!
Han Tae-soo. Han Tae-soo.
Han Tae-soo. Tae-soo!
Tae-soo, come to mommy.
Han Tae-soo.
Stop!
Han Tae-soo!
Han Tae-soo!
Tae-soo.
Tae-soo, come to mommy.
Mommy's not going to punish you.
I'm just very curious.
About whether daddy really came to you.
No.
Tae-soo?
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!
Tae-soo?
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Mommy.
- Tae-soo.
- Mommy.
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo! Tae-soo!
No, Tae-soo!
Stop it!
Please stop it.
Why?
Why are you doing this to us?
I just picked them up.
That's all I did.
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Tae-soo!
Take me instead.
Not my daughter.
Not Tae-soo.
Please.
Those who take the red shoes away
will all die.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oki.
It's me, Keiko.
You are Oki.
- You killed them all.
- No.
- You killed me, too.
- No. It's impossible.
It's not me. No, I didn't do it.
It's not me. It's not me.
No. No. No!
Oki. Oki.
<i>- How'd you know I was at the hospital?</i>
- It's not me.
No, it's not me.
<i>You called me.</i>
<i>Lost the other pair?</i>
<i>Know what Tae-soo said?</i>
<i>She said that daddy's cold.</i>
<i>And he must be taken out.</i>
