        ( whining )
Woof, woof !
Woof, woof, woof !
            Nice try, fleabag.
                 <i>Zeus</i> !
            Get outta here !
                 <i>Blcch,</i>
                Dog germs !
            Do I smell
            some dinner ?!
             <i>Breakfast.</i>
                I knew that.
You've been up
all night again, huh ?
                Sorry,
                it's just that
            I've been working
            on this Melody
    And it's somewhere in there.
    I just can't find it.
            What's this ?
Breakfast burrito.
                Cool, thanks.
                Let me see
                your face.
                Excellent, b+.
            So, what's in
            this burrito ?
Eggs, refried beans,
onions, jalapeños,
Peanut butter,
mozzarella cheese,
pineapple chunks.
Oh, yeah,
and lettuce.
So it's nutritionally
balanced.
Oh, shoot !
My burrito !
                Ugh !
                ( whispering )
                Zeus, psst.
                C'mon, c'mon.
                Good boy,
                eat it up.
                 Thank you,
                 <i>thank you.</i>
Oh, <i>good,</i>
<i>you finished yours.</i>
I'll go get you
another one.
                Woof !
And you two <i>stay</i>
At the enrichment program
all day, okay ?
    ( in robot voice )
    you-are-understood-mother.
                        Ditto.
I'm not in the mood for
the principal calling me
    Telling me
    that you two--
( cat shrieking )
    What is that ?
    Lovely.
        Jordan, cow bone !
Woof, woof, woof !
    Hey !
        Ahh !
    Cow bone.
                Cow bone,
                cow bone !
            Zeus, cow bone !
                Zeus !
        Zeus, cow bone !
                Zeus, cow bone !
                Cow bone !
                C'mon, go on !
                    Go on !
Pfft...
                I'm so sorry.
                Let me help.
No, that's okay.
        Oh, jeez.
Here, let me help.
        Just how do you
        propose to do that ?
I'll put your flowers
back in the ground here.
    Wait, wait, no.
Actually, I have a very
particular way of doing this.
I like to put the roots
in the ground.
                     <i>Oh...</i>
                    Very...
You new in
the neighborhood ?
                    Yeah.
        Just renting
        for the week ?
Actually we'll be here
'till the end of July.
            Great !
I'm Terry Barnett.
                Mary Beth...
                Dunhill.
Mary Beth.
                    Right.
I'd love to stay and chat
in my present state
But I'm late
for work.
            That's okay,
            I'll just replant
            your flowers.
Oh, no, that's alright.
            Is there anything
            I can do ?
                    Uh, no.
                How 'bout
                your laundry ?
                I'm a great
                ironer.
If you can just
restrain that...
                    Zeus.
    Yes !
    Thank you.
        Me, Terry, <i>you</i> ?
    Judith.
                You ?
                Nora.
            ( groaning )
You're late.
        I've been frantic,
        don't ask.
What if Roxanne’s
not there ?
We've never been
late before.
            What if she gets
            eaten by a shark
            Sitting there
            waiting for us ?
    What if I'm sorry, Becky,
    I had a rough morning ?
    Oh, yeah ?
            Well, it's about
            to get rougher.
        We've been rejected
        by the Pason Foundation,
     <i>And</i> the manheim,
        And the delphi.
Great !
That leaves
the Rockland Grant.
If I don't get <i>that,</i>
<i>I'll be--</i>
        Stocking goldfish
        at the local store.
Very funny,
Claude.
            I wasn't joking.
    Perhaps we should strive
    for that grant <i>together.</i>
"the sum of the parts
being greater than the whole."
I don't think so.
Somehow I think our
research philosophies
are <i>slightly</i> different.
        Oh, I didn't know
        I ever <i>had</i> one.
    Let me know
    if you change your mind.
         <i>He</i> should be
         working with <i>sharks.</i>
                He'd feel
                more at home.
     If I don't get
     <i>major</i> funding soon
        Roxanne's gonna
        be in a <i>pool</i>
Doing sound recognition tests
for the <i>rest</i> of her life,
        Probably for <i>him.</i>
        Good morning, guys.
    Hey, Phil.
Let's play the sounds of
the other dolphins for Roxanne
And see if
she runs away.
Okay, Roxanne,
I'm comin', sweetheart.
    ( dolphin chirps )
        We'll do a body check,
        check for rake marks.
We'll see if she's been
playing with other dolphins.
These are from our
last session, right ?
                        Right.
        ( sniffing )
        Burritos ?
                Do you smell
                burritos ?
    Yeah.
        ( loud burp )
                     <i>You.</i>
You're so cute !
                No, this dog
                is not cute.
        This dog is
        the hound from hell.
C'mon, you Zeus,
whatever your name is.
        Get up here,
        sit down, sit !
            Sit, <i>stay.</i>
                     <i>Stay.</i>
    ( Jordan )
    Zeus !
    Yo, Zeus !
            Zeus !
                Zeus !
I think
I got Roxanne.
        Great !
                I'm cursed.
He's <i>so</i> cute.
                He's <i>not</i> cute.
                You stay
                right <i>there</i>
    Or you're gonna get
    a free swimming lesson !
            He's giving me
            a face like that.
            Zeus !
We've got her.
        Roxanne,
        sorry I'm late.
    C'mon,
    that's a girl.
Good morning
to you too, Roxanne.
    How are you ?
C'mon.
Very good.
Woof, woof !
        Thanks a lot, Zeus !
( Zeus barking )
    Maybe if we give him
    some food he'll calm down.
Maybe if he <i>becomes</i> food
he'll calm down.
            She did not
            mean that.
Yes, I did.
( Mary Beth )
we're outta here.
Zeus,
where are you ?
C'mon, Zeus !
    Zeus !
                Zeus ?
                Zeus ?
                Lost the dog.
    Great.
    My new neighbor's
    gonna think
    I've shanghaied his dog
    and fed him to the sharks.
    Zeus ?!
    ( Mary Beth )
    Zeus ?!
     <i>C'mon.</i>
            Oh, my gosh.
            C'mere !
Get the camera.
I got it.
                7:10,
                2:15,
            Off location six.
        We have a canine Zeus,
        we have Roxanne.
Woof, woof, woof !
            What are
            they <i>doing</i> ?
Talking to
each other.
                They're
                communicating.
They are <i>talkin'.</i>
                I think...
            We're witnessing
                Inter-species
                communication.
Mary Beth.
                    What ?
You're gonna get
that Rockland Grant.
                Yes !
            I love this dog.
                I've always
                loved this dog
                From the <i>minute </i>
                <i>I saw that dog.</i>
        Linda, what have
        you got ?
Mother and calf.
    Mother and calf.
    Yes.
Let's separate these two
for the next 24 hours.
Begin the sonar
recognition test series
And increase the volume
of the masking sounds
Until mother and calf
can no longer communicate.
            The baby
            needs to <i>feed.</i>
"the baby
needs to feed."
The sacrifice is for
the <i>good</i> for all mankind.
For <i>science.</i>
Yeah, for
Dr. Claude carver.
            Swing it around.
    You got it ?
            Hold it steady.
( Mary Beth )
great submersible.
Look at that.
    I could really use
    something like <i>that.</i>
    How'd <i>you</i> get it ?
                Oh, I pulled
                a few strings.
    Perhaps you'd like to
    take her down sometime.
Oh, yeah, sure !
    Solo.
            I keep telling you
    Two keen scientific minds
    are better than one.
    Yes, but neither
    are any good
Without the
essential ingredient.
                    What might
                    that be ?
    Heart.
                    Sure.
            Hey, hey !
I'll <i>drop kick</i> you
from here to Miami !
( Mary Beth )
no, you will <i>not.</i>
        C'mon, Zeus,
        let's get outta here.
            Phil, get my bag,
            will you ?
            There you go.
            You deserve it.
( boy )
let's go !
        Great.
Okay, so let me
get this straight.
You don't want us to have
any fun over the Summer.
    I don't want you
    hanging out with
    borderlines.
Craig isn't
borderline, mom.
     <i>And</i> ditching your
     enrichment classes.
            Well, we're just--
We were just--
Rescheduling.
                Yes, right.
        Grounded.
        This block,
        one week.
            Oh, no, mom.
            Zeus !
            Zeus.
    Where'd you guys
    find him ?
Actually he found <i>me,</i>
<i>and you are ?</i>
    I'm Jordan Barnett.
    I'm with him.
        I see you and Zeus
        have become friends.
Well, miracles
sometimes happen.
What's that ?
        Some photos
        I took this morning.
What ?
            I can't
            believe--
        Oh, my God !
( Mary Beth )
charming.
        Looking good, mom !
Working on
two weeks.
        Here.
            Your house has
            a satellite dish,
            doesn't it ?
                Yeah.
            Mom ?
Okay, but not
all the channels.
            C'mon, Zeus !
Your dog was on the boat
with me all day.
                    Really ?
        I'm sorry, I won't
        let that happen again.
No, actually it sort of
seemed to suit him.
            Really.
Really.
I'd like to
take him out <i>again</i> if --
    Sure, you can take him
    on a cruise to Antarctica,
        But he's Jordan's dog.
    Would you mind
    If I just ask
    him something ?
Go right ahead.
                Gimme that !
Can I just watch this
for a <i>minute</i> ?
    Girls, girls,
    time out.
            Where's Jordan ?
In there.
        What are you
        watching ?
                ( Mary Beth )
                hello.
Oh, hi.
            Hi, can I come in ?
Yeah, sure.
                "braveheart".
                Wow !
                Did you do
                all these ?
        Yeah.
That one's gonna be the cover
for my dad's opera score.
                Your dad
                writes opera ?
It's a rock opera.
    Most of the time
    he does music
    For commercials
    and really tall elevators.
        It's only
        to pay the bills.
( woman on TV )
we have now brought the
psychic friends network...
Love that
satellite dish, huh ?
        This is gonna
        sound really lame,
    But we don't even
    have <i>one</i> TV in our house.
             We're like a media
             <i>impaired</i> family.
            Oh.
            Hey, is this
            your mom ?
Yeah... She died.
        Sorry to hear that.
        You must miss her a lot.
            Can I talk to you
            for a minute ?
        Yeah.
I think Zeus is
a very special dog.
        What do
        you mean ?
Well...
I <i>think</i> that Zeus
is capable of--
Inter-species
communication.
    What's the big deal ?
    I talk to Zeus all the time.
        Ah,
But <i>Zeus</i> is talking
with my <i>dolphin.</i>
            You own
            a <i>dolphin</i> ?
I don't <i>own</i> her,
Roxanne lives in the bay,
But I kinda
take care of her.
She used to
live in a tank.
We're reintroducing her
into the ocean.
Now the problem is,
That she doesn't really
take to other dolphins.
But she seems
to like your Zeus.
So I was thinking,
        It might be
        really interesting
        To get the two together,
        Zeus and Roxanne,
        And just see how things
        go from <i>there.</i>
                What do
                you think ?
Well, this has to be
Zeus' decision.
                        Alright.
        So, Zeus, would you like
        to go out with Roxanne ?
            Woof, woof !
            Is that
            a "yes" ?
                    Woof !
Yeah.
                    Great.
                    You like
                    our mom ?
    Yeah, sure I do.
    Enough to
    go out with her ?
                    How 'bout
                    Saturday ?
Alright.
It's okay.
Okay,
new behavior.
That's it.
What is she <i>doing</i> out there
with that dog ?
                Havin' fun.
            No.
    I'll tell you
    what she's doing.
    She's trying to
    steal my grant.
    That's just not
    gonna happen.
        No, sir !
Hey, watch where
you're going !
        I <i>was</i> and I <i>am.</i>
You're driving too fast.
There are kids around.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was in a hurry
to visit with Miss Dunhill.
        Apparently
        so were you,
And failed to look both ways
before crossing the street.
        Thank God
        for anti-lock brakes.
What are you
doing here ?
        These are the manuals
        for the submersible.
        It's yours whenever
        you want it.
Really ?
( man )
invite me in,
I'll go over them with you.
Alright.
Terry, did you
need something ?
            Oh, no,
            it's not important.
Alright.
            Never is.
        So, this is
        a surprise.
    It is ?
                    Bye, mom.
    We're goin'
    for a test ride.
            I thought you two
            were grounded.
Just around
the block.
                With Zeus
                and Jordan.
Please, mom ?
Come on mom !
            One block.
I love you !
        Thank you,
        mommy.
Bye, mom !
You should think about
boarding school for those two.
Now, where were we ?
                The catch.
No catch.
        Boy.
        This is it ?
This is it.
    I don't know
    about this.
    Woof, woof !
                Hey, get out
                of there !
        ( sirens )
        This is <i>definitely </i>
        <i>getting out of hand.</i>
    Okay, hold it
    right there.
Judith ?
What's going on ?
            Judith and Nora
            are getting busted.
            This is probably
            their first offense.
    I can probably get them off
    with a stern warning.
Mm-hmm.
C'mon.
    So, am I
    to believe
That cute little dog
and your dolphin
Are actually talking ?
            Incessantly.
Wow.
I have all this communication
skills data on file.
Perhaps you might
wanna reconsider
About pooling
our research
And applying for that
Rockland Mammal Grant together ?
The catch !
            What, what catch ?
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
I already applied
for my grant.
    But thanks
    for the mini sub.
    It was very
    unselfish of you.
            Hey, thanks for
            talking deputy dog
                Out of serious
                jail time.
        You're welcome,
        youngster.
                What's
                the catch ?
            Probably a lecture,
            right, Jordan ?
No, he's not
too good at those.
        But, I'm gonna <i>try.</i>
( motorcycle approaching )

that's it, all off
who are gettin' off !
    Just around
    the block ?
Do you two girls even <i>know</i>
<i>what time it is ?</i>
        Yeah.
    It's time for the
    marlins-reds game.
                Huh ?
            On your
            satellite dish.
                It's been real !
        ( Jordan )
        did I miss something ?
Tell me they weren't
robbing a bank ?
            They weren't
            robbing a bank.
Thank you.
                They're <i>still</i>
                <i>talking ?</i>
        Probably
        busting us.
                Not Terry.
                Give me those !
                I can read lips.
"live to ride."
            "ride to live."
            A way of life.
"a way of life" ?
    That's just a logo
    they use to sell the bike.
Who cares about reading lips ?
I'm reading <i>body</i> language.
    And they are talking
    a <i>mile</i> a minute.
                    Oh, yeah.
        What are
        they saying ?
                She's asking
                him out.
        ( Judith )
        no way.
                        Way.
Woof, woof !
        Whoa.
                Okay.
                You can--
                    Right.
    ¶ it was
    a teen-age wedding ¶
    ¶ and the old folks

Wow.
             <i>Killer.</i>
<i>Cool, mom.</i>
See, mom ?
You can look good when you try.

        Yes.

Whatever you like.
    Jordy, you listen to
    Mrs. Rice, okay ?!
Yes, father, sir !
    ( starting bike )
You okay ?
        Woof, woof !
                We are good.

( Judith )
we think you spend too much
time alone, Jordan.
            We've <i>gotta</i> do
            something about it.
( calypso music )
Oh, he put it--
I don't know
how to play poker.
        That's okay, Jordan,
        we'll teach you.
The main thing
you need to know
Is you <i>have</i> to
bet something.
     But I don't
     <i>have</i> any money.
            That's okay, too.
            I'm sure we can
            think of <i>something.</i>
Maybe we can
bet <i>chores</i> ?
             <i>Chores</i> !
What <i>kind</i> of chores ?
Stuff your parents make
you do around the house
So they feel
you're useful.
You know,
chores.
I do <i>all</i> the chores
around here.
You won't have to.
If you win, that is.
        Deal.
This Claude guy--
Do you <i>see</i> him ?
                    Every day.
Oh, really ?
                Really and
                unfortunately.
        He's the head honcho
        at the institute.
            I used to be
            his assistant,
        But we had
        a parting of the ways.
Oh. Would it be tactless
to ask over what ?
                Third party.
Oh, I apologize,
never mind--
                    A dolphin.
"a dolphin."
            I happened to think
            that the dolphin
            Was more important
            than <i>his</i> career.
I agree.
    ( man )
    hey, c'mon,
    join us !
            C'mon !
You have three of a kind.
That's excellent.
            Yeah, but I have
            the two of clubs.
Two of clubs
beats <i>anything.</i>
Sorry, man.
    Gonna have to
    clean my room for a month.
( Judith )
sorry.
                    Whoa !
    Let's see, Jordan,
    you've got tens and jacks.
            That's two pair.
            That's real good--
    But, I have a three,
    a five,
A seven, a Jack
and a Queen.
Cutthroat straight.
That beats <i>you,</i> sorry.
    You're gonna have to
    water our plants for...
            Two weeks.
                We better
                get going.
                    We will...
                    Eventually.
You said that dolphins
are telepathic.
            How about people ?
Some people.
                    Your bet.
Double
or nothing.
I'm your slave
for the rest of the Summer
Or we're back
to even.
                    You sure ?
I like to live
on the edge.
        Well, you just
        crashed and burned.
        I have
        a straight <i>flush.</i>
Oh, yeah,
oh, yeah.
And you know what ?
This is
the two of clubs.
                        No.
                    How'd you
                    do that ?
It's <i>all </i>
<i>in the wrist.</i>
            I had
            a great time.
You sound
surprised.
                I am.
                I mean,
                no, no, no,
                Please,
                I don't mean
        That I'm surprised
        that I had a good time.
                        I'm...
                    For...
                She's really
                into it.
    ( Jordan )
    give him a break,
    he's a little Rusty.
         <i>More</i> than
         a little.
Yes !
            Woof, woof,
            woof, woof, woof !
Hey !
Shh !
Shut up !
Get outta here !
You get, get !
                Get out !
            Stop it, stop it,
            stop it, stop it !
Woof, woof, woof,
woof, woof !
                Zeus !
            Zeus ?
            Damn.
        Okay, here I come.
Zeus.
What are
you doing ?
Okay,
You're a weird dog.
It's the creature
from the black lagoon.
            Yeah, dressed
            like Dr. Carver.
            Get me a towel !
Creature, sir !
        ( guitar riff )
        I think
        they hear you.
That's where
Roxanne should be.
With <i>them.</i>
                    Cool fish.
I think you've
got yourself a band.
            Good job, mates !
        Rehearsal tomorrow,
        same place, same time !
            Everybody sober !
            You know
            dolphins.
Yeah.
I don't wanna
lose you, Terry.
            I don't wanna
            lose me either.
When are
you leaving ?
        I gotta go
        to Boca Raton...
            For a week,
            mix my tracks,
            Then it's off
            to Boston
            And a regular job,
            Jordan's in school.
            How 'bout you ?
I'm here through the Summer
if I get my grant.
            And if you don't
            get the grant ?
Minnesota aquarium
tour guide.
                Ugh !
Mary Beth won't share,
will she ?
Neither will I !
Inter-species
communication.
I'll show <i>her</i>
<i>inter-species communication !</i>
Let's start with her.
She looks sickeningly
cute enough.
( whimpering & yelping )
                ( snoring )
                    See ya.
See ya.
I'd like to
thank you.
            Really, for what ?
            'cause we're going
            down in the sub ?
            I should be
            thanking <i>you.</i>
No, I mean thanks
for helping Terry.
He hasn't been able
to write in a long time.
( Jordan )
Roxanne’s
so graceful.
                ( Jordan )
                oh, <i>cool.</i>
( Mary Beth )
uh-oh, drift nets.
They kill thousands
of dolphins every year.
Where do they
come from ?
            Illegal fishermen.
        C'mon, let's lead
        Roxanne outta here.
    ( Jordan )
    we're gonna <i>have</i> to
    leave next week.
    There's a new
    family moving in.
You could stay
at <i>our</i> house.
        What about my dad ?
( Judith )
we have two extra rooms.
                 <i>Perfect.</i>
Hey girls,
what brings <i>you</i> here ?
        You've burned
        the school down.
        Then, why are
        you here ?
Thank you.
        Thank you.
This looks good.
                    Thank you.
        Okay, why are you two
        eating salads ?
You always
eat salad, mom.
        Why can can't <i>we</i>
        <i>eat salad ?</i>
            I'm sorry,
            no satellite dish.
        They're too expensive,
        we can't afford it--
No, mom,
it's not a satellite dish.
It's really that
Terry and Jordan
Need a place
to live for a while.
We want them at our house.
We have two extra rooms.
Yeah,
c'mon, mom.
            Whoa, whoa.
    Why do you think
    they're even <i>interested</i>
    <i>in staying at our house ?</i>
Well, Jordan does.
And so
does Terry.
                    Says who ?
Jordan told us.
He told us
lots of stuff.
Curious
to know, mom ?
                What <i>exactly </i>
                <i>did they say ?</i>
Okay, well--
    It started out...
The rest of
the Summer ?
You sure this was
Mary Beth’s idea ?
And where are
my Twinkies ?!
                I made you
                a fruit salad.
            It's in
            the refrigerator.
    And of course,
    it <i>was</i> her idea.
            You're <i>sure.</i>
Absolutely.
And dad,
use a spoon ?
                Mm-hmm.
            Right here,
            I knew that.
        Now, before
        we do this,
    There's a few things
    you gotta know about me.
                    Uh-oh.
    You one of these guys that
    howls at the full Moon ?
    I'm afraid so.
                    Oh, dear.
            It's a little late
            to be reticent now.
            After all,
            this was <i>your</i> idea.
         <i>My</i> idea ?
                    Mm-hmm.
        Jordan said
        it was--
    Jordan said
    it was <i>your</i> idea for--
        No, the girls told <i>me </i>
        <i>that you said--</i>
        No, I--
        We've been set <i>up.</i>
By world-class
professionals.
    Well ?
What are we gonna do,
professor ?
Well...
I <i>suppose...</i>
If you stayed that I could
continue my work with Zeus.
                Mm-hmm, and...
                I could finish
                my second act.
So, I guess we'll
just have to
Make the best of it.
     <i>Man,</i> we're good.
Woof, woof !
Should I take this stuff
next door now ?
        Just put it
        outside first.
Why ?
        'cause I said so.
     <i>Jeesh !</i>
Lemonade ?
            No, thank you.
What happened ?
                Nothing.
What <i>didn't</i> happen ?
        Jordan ?
It's gone south.
    What are we <i>doing</i> this for ?
    Are we doing this for <i>us</i> ?
    Are we doing this for
    the Rockland foundation ?
            Are we doing it
            for the <i>kids</i> ?
                What ?
All of the above.
                I don't know.
                I don't know.
It's okay, just--
Take as much time
as you need.
                ( Jordan )
                it's time
                to go, Zeus.
            I don't
            understand.
        If a dog and a dolphin
        can get along
        Why can't our mom
        and his dad ?
( Zeus whining )
    Woof, woof !
        Zeus, <i>please.</i>
                I feel
                badly enough.
    Then why don't you
    turn around ?
        I wish I could.
    I don't see
    anyone <i>else</i> driving.
            Jordan !
Hey,
good morning, boss.
Hey, you alright ?
                What's wrong ?
They're gone.
So is Zeus.
They're just gone.
            Men and dogs, huh ?
                C'mere.
        It's okay.
         <i>Oh.</i>
    I could almost cry.
    Tears of Joy.
    That dolphin
    is fair game now,
Track her.
    C'mon, Zeus.
    Zeus, c'mon.
                 <i>Zeus.</i>
                 <i>C'mon.</i>
What is she doing ?
                I don't know.
    She's running away.
        She won't let us
        near her anymore.
So much for inter-species
communication.
        That's what happens
        When you work with these
        animals in the wild.
        They can walk out on you
        whenever they want to.
        If we can bring Roxanne
        back into the lab--
    Dr. Carver,
It's illegal to catch
a dolphin in the open sea.
                Excuse <i>me,</i> Phil.
You know
he's right.
I'll replace Roxanne
with one of the simpletons,
    Perhaps even <i>two.</i>
As scientists
we have to circumvent
These ridiculous
bureaucratic regulations.
            ( man whistling )
    Girls, dinner !
Feeding time at
the enrichment program.
                I resent that.
Why do you treat us
like your little Einsteins ?
                    What do
                    you mean ?
Did <i>your</i> parents
ever send <i>you</i>
To an enrichment
program ?
                    No.
C'mon, mom,
it's the <i>Summer.</i>
    Enjoy it !
                You're right.
                You're right.
    I guess I'm just trying
    to <i>rush</i> everything too much.
    I'm trying to rush <i>you</i>
    <i>into being little adults,</i>
    I'm rushing Roxanne
    back to the wild.
Probably rushing <i>Terry</i> into
I don't <i>know</i> what.
            Oh, no, mom,
            We'll take
        Some of the blame
        for Terry.
        Actually, mom...
            We'll take
            most of the blame.
( Judith )
alright,
all of the blame.
I was so close.
I was so close
To reintroducing
Roxanne into a pod.
And then--
                What happened
                to Roxanne ?
She's gone.
        She'll be back,
        don't worry.
No, she won't.
She misses Zeus
too much.
Mom.
            Zeus !
            Zeus !
    ( phone rings )
            Hello ?
            It's me.
                Yes ?
                I see.
                    ( Jordan )
                    anything ?
        Nope, <i>nothing.</i>
        I just <i>know</i> he's
        trying to go back.
            That is
            unbelievable.
        That's like <i>scary.</i>
    I think it's time to take
    Jurassic measures.
    I agree.
    What do we have to lose ?
Alright,
who is that ?
                Hi.
            Can you please
            hold on a second ?
                    Dad.
            It's for you, mom.
Who is it ?
        It's Jane freeman
        From the
        record company.
        It's somebody selling
        cemetery plots.
            Mom, get the phone.
        Hello ?
            Hello, gorgeous.
        I had a dream about <i>you</i>
        <i>last night.</i>
                    You did ?
                    Oh, yeah.
        We went all the way,
        positively platinum.
                    Oh.
        I had a dream about
        you too last night
        And we went
        resoundingly tin.
            Hello, Terry.
        They don't give up
        too easily, do they ?
        No, they <i>do</i> not.
        I heard about Zeus.
            I heard
            about Roxanne.
            She's pretty hurt.
                So is he.
        I mean, I think
        she'll get over it.
                Maybe...
        We can give it
        a little more time.
                We'll talk.
                Yeah.
                Tomorrow ?
                Yeah.
            Yeah, tomorrow

            Jordy !
I woke up and
I wanna smell the coffee !
    Jordy ?
    ( Jordan )
    hi, dad, it's me.
    I've gone to
    look for Zeus.
    Hi, dad, it's me.
    I've gone to

        Oh, <i>shoot.</i>
    ( phone rings )
    Hello.
        Mary Beth,
        it's Becky.
I know it's Sunday but I thought
you should know about this.
    Know what ?
I came to the office to
check up on a few things and--
    And <i>what,</i> Becky ?
                Claude carver
                was just in.
    He said they found a dolphin
    caught in drift nets...
                        Dead.
            It's not Roxanne.
I've gotta
find her, Becky.
            Right.
            No more
            Mr. Nice guy.
            Look who's back.
        Now Roxanne
        is ours.
No, Dr. Carver.
Yours.
                    We quit.
        No, you don't.
        You're <i>fired</i> !
    We got a date
    with a dolphin.
Excuse me, sir !
How would you like to be part
of scientific history ?!
Can I interest you
in a case of rum ?
Enjoy your flight.
Next in line.
            ( Jordan )
            do you have
            standby ?
What ?
            Do you have
            standby ?
And do you have a good reason
for being here ?
        Uh-oh.
            Take us to 0-3-5
            full throttle !
        This mongrel
        is the perfect bait !
            Roxanne will
            come to <i>us</i> !
        ( beeping )
            Yes !
        We got her !
        Ah, my foot !
You know, Jordy,
We're gonna do everything
we can to find Zeus
But it's extremely unlikely
he made it down here.
                Dad,
        Zeus is an
        extremely extreme dog.
                That he is.
    ( Jordan )
    he's also in love.
        ( Terry )
        an extreme emotion.
        Why don't you
        try it sometime, dad ?
It's okay.
    ( Judith )
    Jordan !
    Jordan !
        C'mon !
Cab's waiting.
Let's go.
            Mind if I
            tag along ?
    C'mon !
                Becky.
        There's something
        you should know.
                It's about
                Dr. Carver.
            Hey, girls,
            Terry,
            What are you
            guys doing here ?
Where's my mom ?
Her boat's gone.
        She's out
        looking for Roxanne.
    C'mon, Roxanne.
Ready the net.
            ( Zeus barking )
                Ready...
                Now !
                You missed,
                you idiot !
            Get it back up !
        Get it up, fool !
        C'mon, move, move !
Get me out !
You stupid dog.
Mom ?
                Mom !
            ( Nora )
            mom !
    Mom !
        ( Jordan )
        flags up,
        she's down in the sub.
            How long can she
            stay down there ?
        45 minutes
        I think.
        Roxanne.
        Roxanne.
    ( Mary Beth )
    yes, Roxanne.
I think she wants you
to follow her.
Get me a knife !
            You okay ?
            Roxanne.
    ( Jordan )
    c'mon !
( Claude )
good dog,
yes, yes,
That's a good dog.
    No !
( Claude )
you mongrel !
Stay, stay.
What are you doing ?
No, no, no !
            Officer,
            arrest this dog !
        Oh, we will.
    Free Dr. Carver,
    and then arrest him.
I confess,
it was all him !
    What are you talking about,
    you idiot ?!
            I'll kill you !
    Atta boy, Zeus.
( man across street )
I'm waiting !
    How do you like
    your new neighbors ?
            I liked the
            old ones better.
            I'm gonna
            take a shower.
I'm gonna
make some coffee.
Don't do that
again, okay ?
    We believe that with
    all that's happened
        It's clearly
        established that
        You <i>do </i>
        <i>like our mom.</i>
Of course I do.
        Enough to <i>marry</i> her ?
                How 'bout
                next Sunday ?
Where do you
keep the coffee ?
    At this point,
    if there's anyone here
    That has any reason
    that this marriage
Between Mary Beth Dunhill
and Terrence Paul Barnett

Speak now or forever

                        ( man )
                        wait !
                Wait !
    Sorry, they told me to bring
    this down here right away.
Better offer ?
        It's the grant !
        ( Jordan )
        good going, Mary Beth--
                I mean <i>mom.</i>
Now I suppose
you can kiss the bride.
What's going on ?
                I think...
            He's telling her
            it's time.
            Go on, girl.
