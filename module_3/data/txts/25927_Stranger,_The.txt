Okay, you've got to make a wish.
But I married you to take care of us.
Okay, everybody ready for cake?
Your family is doing well
in protective custody.
Did you do it?
Yay, okay. Everyone sing Happy...
Don't you understand?
You help me you help yourself.
I love it, Daddy.

So you're saying you can't or you won't
intervene in Salt Lake City?
Look, Mason, you're not my superior.
I don't take my orders from you.
I asked you nicely.
So what is there in Salt Lake City
that scares you?
The Jazz?
Look, it's none of our business.
It's Bureau business
and it started in our jurisdiction.
AII right, if you really think our presence
there will make the difference,
I'II contact them and get
a copy of the report.
But for the record,
you're still not my boss.
Yet.
He's back.
Then the red cart,
that would represent her childhood.
So as you can see,
random objects can in themselves
trigger profound reversal
of some forms of retrograde amnesia.
Which in many cases can result
in a recaptured memory.
Excuse me.
- Was it really him?
- I'm fine. And you?
I'm sorry. It's good to see you.
You knoW, it might have been him.
I showed his photo to Seattle SWAT.
- And?
- Well, they saw a resemblance.
But this guy, he was a dirty
doWn-and-outer.
Besides, they only got a brief glimpse
of him before he ran.
- Why did he run?
- He killed a guy.
It actually was in the act
of saving a little girl's life.
That sounds more like him.
The local PD
was running a ransom exchange.
A local lawyer recorded
some incriminating conversations
with the son of a big mob boss.
Kid got spooked,
kidnapped the lawyer's daughter.
I guess our guy was in the right place
at the right time.
- Was it really him?
- Give me back my baby.
I gave you what you wanted.
Now let her go.
Maybe I should just keep her.
She is a pretty little thing.
For God's sake help me, please.
Please help me.
You just killed her.
Say goodbye to your little...
They tried to kill him
for his efforts.
This is it.
God knows how he is,
but he got away.
Now we're not the only ones
Iooking for him.
Let them join the club.
See if they have any better luck.
They think he's been here
for about six months,
but they couldn't make
a positive ID without prints.
You can't leave prints
when you don't have any.
Mason.
It's another digit.
He's starting to remember.
So what do we do now?
Same thing we always do...
We wait.
What are you gonna do with that?
If we see him again it could be a key
to unlocking some
of his buried memories.
I want to thank you
for sticking through all this.
He is my patient.
I need to see this through.
And you don't miss me at all?
It was one night.
I think we should leave it at that.
So he got away again?
Yes, sir.
And the last time we had
any contact with him was?
1 0 months ago.
Tucson. No collateral.
But there's been more than enough
collateral on this case,
hasn't there, Agent Reese?
But he's potentially a major source
of embarrassment for us, sir.
Not as embarrassing as an overbudgeted
case with no results.
Look, somewhere in that
screwed-up head of his
he knows who the mole who's been
tipping off the Russian mob is.
Don't we want to be ahead of that?
Sure. But we haven't
been so far, have we?
Let it go.
Even in these alternate states,
the clues to the true self
can always be found
in the metaphor
that the mind is playing out.
If we look at each piece
of the larger puzzle
then we can discover...
we can discover
that they fit together
to tell the story.
But putting the puzzle together,
noW that's something
that only the patient can do
and only when they're ready.
That's it for today, class.
Paper is due tomorrow.
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Has something come up with
the extension of the numbers?
No.
I mean, I don't know.
Look, Grace, there's no way
to sugar-coat this.
They've killed the case.
What? You can't do this.
It's not up to me.
But I don't understand.
It's Chief Pickar.
He's wanted to shut this down
ever since our guy went rogue.
He's not rogue. He's sick.
He needs help.
It's out of my hands.
So that's it?
You just forget about it?
Act like he never existed?
He has.
Grace, I can't go against orders.
Well, maybe you can't.
But...
but if I can find him...
I can help him.
It's not a good idea.
Look, you work for the FBI, not me.
Now for this first interview
I'm just gonna ask you a few
simple questions, okay?
I'm not crazy.
Is that what you think?
That I think you're crazy?
Well, you did say you found me
covered in blood
trying to break into
the Seattle shipping docks.
Well, yes, there was that.
So if I'm not crazy,
then what am l?
The mind is an amazing thing.
When things become
too much for us to bear,
it can protect us
without us even knowing.
I believe you saw and or experienced
some kind of trauma
that initially triggered this state.
Amigos.
Uno, dos...
Gracias.
Muchas gracias, se√±or.
Make sure the gringo is dead.
Vamos.
Is it someone that you know?
Fuck.
Big bad ass, this one.
I keep telling you
I don't know who they are.
Maybe you don't, amigo.
But you know where
you were taking them.
I am going to show you...
I am going to show you
what we do
to cop killers in this country.
Aw, shit.
Is it a child that you're drawing?
Don't do it.
Hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
I don't know who I'm calling here.
It's the only number I can remember.
Where are you?
I'm sorry for bothering you.
No no, you're not bothering me.
Please don't hang up.
I'm a friend.
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
Hey!
Yeah, I called the number back.
It's a gas station just north
of the California-Oregon border.
Slow down.
Are you sure it was him?
Definitely.
He may be retracing his steps.
Look, he sounded very disoriented.
I'm looking at some pretty gruesome
photos of an all-out slaughter
- at the Tijuana Police Department.
- And?
And they were interrogating a coyote
that fits his description
when he went ballistic and took down
the whole police force.
And you think that it's him?
Or whoever he thinks he is these days.
Look, just the fact that he called
means he's remembering.
It's a cry for help.
Mason, we have to do something.
We've been warned to leave it alone.
No.
You've been warned.
He remembered her number.
I guess that's progress.
Good.
Then what are we doing here?
She wants to try and track him down.
But if we go against orders
it'II just draw suspicion.
What's going on?
They're in my computer.
So what did you find out
about my computer problem?
I don't think you want to know.
I don't think l want to knoW.
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.
AII right, okay. Look,
nobody can access our system
from the outside. Nobody.
- So it is from inside the Bureau.
- Yeah, but here's the thing.
Only two people have the access code
to get into the individual files.
- And I'm one of them.
- And the other is?
Who do you think? Pickar.
I figured.
Don't sweat it. It's not like he was
checking up on you personally.
- You're cool.
- What do you mean?
- You know what he's searching for?
- Yeah. Dude, she's hot.
Who is that?
What, dude?
- I think it's a mistake.
- We'll be okay.
Is it a child that you're drawing?
They killed a man.
You okay there?
Hey, pal, can I help you with something?
You look a little lost.
Believe it or not, my grandmother
was from Moscow.
I could really use the work.
Katya.
Dedulya, where have you been?
I've been shopping.
Here, put this in the galley.
And don't eat all the chocolate.
Dedulya.
So you ever work a boat before?
Yeah, all my life.
East Coast, lobstering.
Well, here we are salmon,
sablefish, some swordfish,
occasional squid.
I can handle nets if that's
what you're fishing for.
Mikhail. Welcome aboard, Jake.
You can hand me the first there.
Thank you.
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.
Have you seen this guy?
Yup.
Headed to Coos Bay.
Boy likes riding fish trucks.
Hey, you're pretty good at that.
I noticed your boat
is named Igrushka Katya...
Katya's Toy.
So that must make you
the famous Katya.
I am.
My daddy named it after me.
He was a fisherman.
What do you mean was?
Isn't he your daddy?
Who? Dedulya.
No, he's my grandfather.
That's a cute granddaughter you've got.
Yeah.
She's all the family I have left.
Her mother died during her birth
and her father...
well, her father was not smart.
This used to be his boat.
Are you sure you've never met
a Vladimir Korchekoff?
No, can't say that I have.
He was Katya's father.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Na zdorovie.
What's up, baby?
Hold on a second.
What can I get you?
A glass of Chardonnay.
Box or jug?
Surprise me.
- What can I get you?
- Beer, thanks.
I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen him?
What, are you a cop or something?
I'm his doctor.
Nope, sorry.
I think l'd remember
if that guy walked in here.
If you do see him,
I'm staying at the Bellevue.
Okay. Will do.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Wonder if she's give me a physical.
Keep the change.
Hey, Mickey. How'd you do today?
We didn't get out.
To much to fix on that old tub.
We'II get out tomorrow.
But I did find a new mate.
Billy, meet Jake here.
Hey, some bird was just in here
a few hours ago looking for him.
- For Moscow?
- Yeah.
- Must be mistaken.
- Yeah?
Well, if you think she ain't,
she's staying up the block at the Bellevue.
You work fast, my friend.
They told me you're looking for me
doWn at the bar.
Yes, of course. Please come in.
Do we know each other?
Um...
I just want to talk with you.
About what?
About you.
And some things that I know.
Please come in.
You know, we've actually met four
times before this, you and l.
I think I'd remember you.
L'd like to tell you
a story if you don't mind.
Please, have a seat.
My name is Dr. Grace Bishop.
You and I met for the first time
two years ago.
An FBI agent named Mason Reese
called me in
when the police found you
on the docks covered in blood.
At the time you said you worked
on a Russian freighter.
Look, lady...
Later at the hospital
you couldn't recall any of it.
And two days after that you escaped.
Then four months later
you were found again,
this time believing yourself to be
Jonathon Bower, a dock worker.
And then again you disappeared.
Look, I don't know who you think
l am, but you definitely got...
Six times you've awoken
that I know of.
This last time we believe
you were taken into custody
trying to truck illegals
over the border from Mexico.
Sounds like I've been busy.
Okay, look, this isn't a joke.
Please, just...
Please.
This is who I'm looking for.
And him.
You won't remember any of this
because your mind won't let you.
This person you think you are now,
you made him up.
These people you've made up.
I'm trying to help you.
You have to believe me.
Shh.
Let's just stay right where we are.
Dr. Grace Bishop, come on out.
We just want to talk
with your friend here.
Tell her to come out.
Come on, tell her to come out.
What's this all about?
We're just gonna wait
here for a while.
Why?
It's for your own safety.
So that gun is for my safety?
No. Don't!
Is he dead?
He's not exactly
the picture of health, is he?
- Who was he?
- L don't knoW.
He must have followed me
home from the bar.
What do we do now?
Let's get the hell out of here.
My car is around back.
Let's go. Just stay close.
Okay.
Right here.
- Are we safe here?
- Yeah, for noW.
Is this yours?
No, the owner said I could stay.
I'm working for him.
Can I get you something?
You gonna take care of that?
No, it's good. l'm good.
So who do you think that was?
According to you,
I don't even know who I am.
You really don't recognize me?
It's like I said before.
I'm trying to but I just don't.
You did this?
Yeah. Kind of a hobby.
Should probably stick to fishing, right?
Where'd you get that?
You gave it to me during
one of our first sessions.
Look, all l knoW
is before these episodes
l was told that you were an FBl
informant inside the Russian mob.
You were involved in busting
some drug-trafficking ring.
And then, I don't know,
something happened.
Dr. Bishop has quite
an obsession with this guy.
I can't believe Agent Reese kept her
involvement from us for this long.
Just heard from the Portland field office.
Someone meeting
our guy's description
just confronted one
of their agents in Coos Bay.
He fled the scene and now
the agent's in critical condition.
You want me
to organize transportation?
No, let Portland deal with it.
With this guy's track record
he's probably long gone by now.
- Where's Reese?
- Can't locate him.
- He hasn't checked in for hours.
- Find him.
- I want this. Take it all down.
- Yes, sir.
You heard him. Bag it, please.
And you know where that is?
AII right.
- Who was that?
- A friend.
Someone that can help.
He's with the FBI.
Right after college a friend
and l headed off to Maine.
We spent a summer learning to lobster.
And it was the mornings
that got me, you know?
There was always
this crispness in the air,
the salt on your tongue.
Sometimes it was so cold you'd think
your fingers were gonna fall off.
The waves and the seagulls,
the hum of the motor...
It was the most connected
to anything I've ever felt.
And you're telling me
I made all that up?
That it never happened?
I don't know if it happened.
Maybe.
Maybe some of it.
Parts of it.
Maybe none of it.
I can still taste the salt on my tongue.
How am I supposed to believe this...
What did you call it?
Dissociative view.
It just takes over anytime and I won't
even knoW it's happening?
That's how it works.
Why?
To protect you.
There's something that happened,
some trauma.
Your mind needed to escape
and this is how it dealt with it.
By becoming other people?
Yes.
What was the trauma?
Truthfully,
I don't know.
Don't!
You son of a bitch.
It took me a while
to put it all together.
I am old man.
I don't remember things so good.
But my son told me everything
before those Mexicans came
and made my Katya an orphan.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You set my son up!
He believed you.
But when you didn't pay them
they filled him so full of lead
I could use his body as an anchor.
You son of a bitch.
You sorry bastard!
I hope your big ass floats.
For what it's worth, l felt bad
for you and your granddaughter.
But I'm not sure
I know what you're talking about.
Get a warrant to track
the doctor's cell.
Yes, sir.
Have we heard anything from Reese?
Nada.
I want you to go
through those tapes.
See if we can come up
with any leads.
Yeah.
Hey, you know what's at stake here.
You don't go home
until it's done.
Yeah.
You seem to be very popular
with people you don't know.
Those Russians
were about to kill both of us
and you don't remember them at all.
No, not a clue.
Do you remember when
those pictures were taken?
No.
Who am I?
Look, you're probably
inbetween fugue states.
You're more like an amnesiac who
just doesn't knoW who they are.
And that's better?
You're starting to remember who I am,
and that's a beginning.
- Both of you okay?
- Barely.
Look, we have to get
away from here right away.
You knoW that guy you put
into the ICU, he was an FBI agent.
How did he know where we were?
Pickar broke into my computer
trying to steal information.
- On him?
- No, on you, Grace.
On me?
- Why?
- Why do you think?
They figured you'd lead them to him,
and they were right.
And now unfortunately
Pickar realizes
that he's not gonna go
get lost or come in quietly.
He reopened the case and he's
heading it up himself personally.
- This is crazy.
- Look, Pickar is crazy.
He will stop at nothing to erase
any evidence against him.
Does he remember anything else?
You know, like the numbers?
What numbers?
What the hell could I have done
to cause all this?
Not something you've done.
It's something you know.
Look, follow me.
I've got to find us a place to hide.
I'II figure this out.
Dude, you have no idea.
I mean, no idea.
This place is like turned upside down.
You're noW a fugitive.
I could go to jail just for talking to you.
- Who is saying what?
- You know that agent in Coos Bay?
He died.
Everybody is saying everything.
And your man just made
the Most Wanted list.
- I am so fucked.
- Not if you help me.
That's how I got fucked
in the first place.
Harris, you help me
you help yourself.
- Mason, you need to come in.
- I will.
But first I need you to get a message
out to Agent Daniels for me.
Harris, are you with me?
A message to Agent Daniels,
yeah l can do that.
I need you to tell him
that I'm bringing our guy in.
- What, the guy?
- Just tell him.
Tell him to give me about eight hours.
He knows the place.
Can I count on you, Harris?
What are my options?
I can do that, yeah.
- Where the hell is he?
- Just relax. He's taking a shower.
Is he all right in there?
Just let him take a shower.
Grace...
that agent died.
He died?
What was he doing there
in the first place?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Pickar would just as soon
see us all dead
before we can prove he's the mole.
- He's the FBI.
- So am I.
We just need to hold out
for a few hours.
Yeah, okay.
Grace,
our guy wasn't an informant
for the Bureau.
He was an agent.
You lied to me?
He was part of a task force
whose job was to infiltrate
the Russian mob
as they were making the move to traffic
for the Tijuana drug cartel.
The Bureau bankrolled him
and he got in so deep
that eventually he became
their dealmaker.
And you couldn't tell me that?
Nobody knew except Pickar, Daniels
and myself.
The mother and daughter
we didn't even tell.
We just tucked them away
into protective custody.
It just wasn't something
you needed to knoW.
How do you know what I need
to know to do my job?
Look, before he went crazy,
he discovered that there
was a mole in the Bureau.
I need him to remember who it was.
But you know it's Pickar.
Yeah, but there's no way l can
make a case without his testimony.
And what's with the numbers?
It may be to a safety deposit box,
a storage bin where he stashed
the Bureau's money
that he never paid the cartel.
What are you saying?
That he's in it for the take?
Truthfully, I have no idea.
But what I do know now is Pickar
would like to see him dead.
And he wouldn't mind if we go too.
Has anyone told his family?
You like it?
You're moving us to God knows where.
No!
You know,
he's been in there a long time.
What's he doing,
curling his hair?
Hey, you okay?
Hey, come on out.
Hey, open the goddamn door.
- Damn!
- Don't shoot him.
Hey! Hold it right there!
You hear me?
I'm counting to three.
One, two,
three...
What the hell is wrong with you?
Shooting him isn't gonna solve anything.
For Christ's sakes, Grace,
l wasn't trying to kill him.
He's our last chance at surviving this
without getting heavy jail time.
That's if we don't get killed first.
So you're that good of a shot that you
were just aiming to wound him?
I'm not gonna let him
disappear on us again.
This what you're looking for?
Hey, look,
l wasn't actually trying
to shoot you, all right?
We're here for your own good.
Just put the gun down, please.
He's telling the truth.
Why don't we all
just take a nice little walk?
Don't do anything rash.
We're all in this together.
Together?
I don't know who the hell y'all are.
Now come on, turn around.
Let's start walking.
No!
Don't shoot.
You have to listen to me.
Give me the keys.
You're just a little
confused right now.
You have to believe me.
I want to help you.
Get in.
Get in!

Nope, but it sure feels that way.
How long ago did they leave you,
your wife and daughter?
Two months.
Cleared out everything.
Can you tell me
anything about what happened
before your wife
and daughter left you?
Was there a fight? An argument?
It was because of my job
at the docks.
I wasn't there for them.
Look, I just need
to know that you're safe.
And how am I supposed
to knoW you're safe?
The Russians are making
the deal with the Tijuana cartel.
I need to take this chance.
Everything okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
It's here.
People are after us.
Do you understand?
I remember the FBI.
Yeah, them too.
The person you are right now
wouldn't happen to knoW
how to hotwire one of those?
Find anything on those tapes?
Not really.
But just heard from
an Oregon Highway Patrolman
who says he spotted
the doc's car at a gas station.
Thinks it was them
that gave chase on a motorcycle.
Three people on a motorcycle?
Just two.
Sound like the doctor and Tomashevsky.
- No Agent Reese?
- No.
Let me guess, they got away.
Yeah, but we did manage to get
a lock on the doctor's cell phone.
Do you want me to contact
the Washington Troopers?
- Have them put an APB out?
- Sure.
- But we should be there.
- Sir.
You seemed pretty comfortable
on the back of that Harley.
I grew up on one.
You rode Harleys?
My brother was a rider.
No kidding? Does he still ride?
No.
He's dead.
I'm sorry.
It's all right.
It's just I don't really talk
about him that much.
It was a long time ago.
I understand.
Guess it really doesn't matter.
You're not gonna remember it anyways.
He killed himself.
Do you know why?
He suffered from a mental illness.
I tried to do everything
I could to help him,
but in the end...
it wasn't enough.
Well, we're almost out of gas.
Where are we going?
Without Mason I'm not sure.
Who?
The man that you beat up last night,
believe it or not,
was trying to help us.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna see if I can
get ahold of him.
- Dr. Bishop.
- Yes?
This is Agent Fleming of the FBI.
We know you're in this junkyard
with a federal fugitive.
We have this place surrounded.
- They're here.
- Who?
The FBl.
We do not want to hurt you.
What are we gonna do?
Come out now.
We have this place surrounded.
Get in. Get in.
- Ln here?
- Get in. Don't make a sound.
Agent Tomashevsky.
Agent Tomashevsky,
we know you're in there.
This is Bureau Chief Ronald Pickar.
You'II be helping her and you
if you turn yourselves in.
Agent Tomashevsky,
you're surrounded.
You have no choice.
Do the right thing.
Give yourself up
and no harm will come to you.
It's the end of the line, Tomashevsky.
Make the easy choice
and we can all go home.
I got him.
Get down! Move!
Over there! Over there!
You can save him, Dr. Bishop.
Just get him to turn himself in.
Come on.
Save yourself, save him. Do it.
- Come on.
- No.
This is Bureau Chief Ronald Pickar.
We've got Dr. Bishop.
It'll be a lot easier on her
and you if you turn yourself in.
He's gonna run.
Let's see. Just hold on.
- Come on out.
- Hands up.
Hands up.
Hands up! Behind your head.
Turn around.
I don't know.
Come on, Tom, you can make this
a lot easier on yourself
if you just cooperate.
Tom? Tom. Tom.
Look, Tom, I don't need you to understand
every aspect of this operation.
Tom.
Come on.
Where's the money, Tom?
I don't know what you're talking about.
AII right, this is your choice.
Pete.
Hold him still. Hold him still.
Come on, man.
Jesus, you can't treat him like this.
What are you giving him?
It's just sodium amobarbital.
We're hoping it'II jog his memory.
You don't get it, do you?
He's not hiding anything by choice.
Sodium amobarbital
has no credibility.
The subject can be coerced
into having a false memory.
That's why you'II be doing the interview.
Do you realize that
you're protecting someone
who has put your life
in great danger?
He would never hurt me.
I'm not talking about
Agent Tomashevsky,
although, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.
I'm talking about Agent Mason Reese.
What did he tell you about all this?
You should know.
You're the one that closed the case.
You're the one
that's trying to have us killed.
No one's trying to kill anyone here,
Dr. Bishop.
And I didn't close the case.
That's why we're all here.
We want lawyers.
This has got to come to an end.
How do I know that you're not the leak?
If you please.
Tom.
Tom!
Dr. Bishop would like
to speak with you.
How do you feel?
Dizzy.
They shouldn't have given you that stuff.
I don't know how they can
get away with this stuff.
- Hey, what's going on? Hey!
- Sit down.
Hey, are you okay?
Do you know the name Tomashevsky?
Because apparently
that's who you are.
- No!
- I love it, Daddy.
That's a really lovely picture.
Is it someone that you know?
I remember the name Lucy.
Lucy.
Lucy? I...
Your daughter.
Is your daughter named Lucy?
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.
It's okay.
It's okay, I'm Agent Daniels.
- We met before with...
- Mason. I remember you.
That right. He sent me
to get you guys out of here.
You've got to help. You too.
- Get yourself up.
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
ASAP, let's go. Lift.
The gray sedan right over there.
You know, Grace,
as soon as Pickar gets that number
he gonna want to cover his tracks.
That means you too.
It means all of us.
Here, get him on here.
I can't take this information to Pickar
without your voicemail.
Ronald Pickar?
Yeah, that's right.
He's remembering.
That's good. That's good.
Run. Run.
Just go. Run.
Just go. Run.
Grace! Grace, come back here!
Grace!
Come here.
I remember the name Lucy.
Lucy.
What are you gonna do with that?
If we see him again it could be a key
to unlocking some
of his buried memories.
Three... three... three...
30... 30... 30...
3041.
A phone.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Enter your password.
What's the password?
You have one unheard message.
Press 1 to play.
Why did you want to see me?
I needed to take this chance.
- You wearing that wire I gave you?
- No.
- Good.
- You sure no one can find us here?
Old Heller Mill.
Unfortunately shake roofs fell out
of favor years ago.
And how's my good
old friend Boris doing?
Well, he may be an old friend of yours,
but he's not such a good friend
of mine right noW.
Look, Tom, I understand you've
been through a difficult time.
But I can tell you that your family,
they're doing fine
in protective custody.
You still got that money I gave you?
You told me not to give it
to them and I didn't,
even though they killed a man
and probably want me dead as well.
I don't need you to understand
every aspect of this operation.
But what I can tell you is the Bureau
thinks the money is gone.
Yeah, but we know it isn't.
Where is it now?
I've got it.
Good.
When this is all over,
we'II both take a split.
Wait a minute.
You told me that withholding that payment
would smoke out the rat in the department.
Well, it worked.
I should have known
you were the mole.
The Bureau's not gonna
want their money back?
They think it's gone.
Hey, listen.
If that money doesn't
eventually show up, I'm dead...
Either from the Russians who know
I never made the payment
or the Mexicans
who never got paid.
The Russians got their dope.
Let them have their war.
That's what this whole
operation was about.
Let them kill each other
while you and I get rich.
You're kidding right?
Not when my career
and life is on the line.
I'm offering you a partnership where
you can make some real dough
for all the sacrificing
you've done for our country.
That's if I live.
You can join your wife and daughter
in protective custody.
I didn't mind screwing the Tijuana cartel.
That was my job.
But I'm not gonna die
for a few lousy bucks.
I wouldn't call $2 million
a few lousy bucks.
You can buy that pretty little Lucy
a whole lot of swing sets.
No.
I'm out.
And so are you.
What do you mean, so am l?
You're wearing that wire,
aren't you?
You're wearing that goddamn wire.
I'm not wearing a wire,
but you did leave one hell of a message.
Hey, stop right there.
You're making a big mistake, pal.
Give me that phone.
It's over, Mason.
Don't you understand?
You help me, you help yourself.
Come back here,
you son of a bitch!
Look, I just need to know
that you're safe.
And how am I supposed
to knoW you're safe?
Hey, I can take care of myself.
Wake up, Tomashevsky.
You remember this place,
don't you?
You sure no one can find us here?
No, old Heller Mill.
Unfortunately shake roofs fell out
of favor years ago.
I figured since you've been here before
it might jog your memory.
You told me that withholding that payment
would smoke out the rat in the department.
Well, it worked.
What started here is about to end
here one way or another.
Either you're gonna remember
where you put my money
and that recording,
or you'II be taking it to your grave.
What is it?
Getting dead, as you like to put it.
Stiff the Mexicans.
Stash the cash.
Now what would that do
other than getting me dead?
I've been through
a lot of crap with you,
including a pair of sore arms.
And just so we
understand each other,
I'm emotionally prepared
not to get what I want.
There is a number.
I need that number...
and what it belongs to.
No!
Think.
Think.
Think!
Is it a safety deposit box?
What bank? I need some answers.
- This is some serious money.
- Lt's 3...
Your family is doing well
in protective custody.
0...
I can take care of myself, right?
I married you
to take care of us.
4...
- Like it?
- I love it, Daddy.
Is it a post office box?
A combination? What?
- It's 3...
- No!
0... 4.
This is the last time we'II be
coming here for a while.
If they ever trace you
back to the Bureau...
I get it.
Your source was right.
The Russians are making
a deal with the Tijuana cartel.
I'm telling you, it's someone
high up in the Bureau.
Everything we know, they know.
So why are we here?
I'm risking my cover to tell you
what we already know?
That's precisely why you're here.
This will smoke out the mole
in the department.
This is some serious money.
Get inbetween the deal.
Stiff the Mexicans.
Stash the cash.
Now what would that do
other than getting me dead?
Well, drive the mole crazy.
Look, he's gonna be
the only one who knows
that the money didn't get
to the destination. It'II break him.
I know it's 304.
What are the rest of the numbers?!
Mental case.
Do something.
I think you know by now
that he's not kidding.
So if I were you,
I'd give him what he wants.
- Thank you for the meeting.
- Not a problem.
But why me?
I don't know who else to talk to.
I'm trusting you with some
very damaging information.
I understand.
Do you have the cell phone with you?
No, it's safe.
- And the money?
- Safer.
Hey, I'm in a lot of jeopardy here.
- I understand your situation.
- I don't think you do.
Agent Reese needs to be
brought into custody
before I turn the money over.
I...
I can't take this information to Pickar
without the voicemail.
Did you happen
to make a copy of it?
I'II figure out how to get it to you
when the time is right.
He's the only superior
you ever talked to.
Not only do l see
your memory improving...
but I see a marked improvement
in your reasoning skills.
So reason this...
If I don't hear those numbers
from your mouth
in the next three seconds,
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Just wanted to let you know
that I'm not kidding.
Not when my career
and life is on the line.
I didn't mind screwing the Tijuana cartel.
That was my job.
But I'm not gonna die
for a few lousy bucks.
You set my son up!
They filled him so full of lead
I could use his body as an anchor.
How's my dear old friend Boris doing?
Well, he may be an old friend of yours,
but he's not such a good friend
of mine right noW.
Come back here,
you son of a bitch!
I know where your family lives!
No!
So for the last time...
3...
0...
4...
1.
You were almost right, Mason.
It was a post office box.
But the money wasn't there.
What?
That's it?
It was a four-digit number?
Where's my money?!
You were dead right about one thing.
He did record the conversation.
I'm sorry you heard that.
What did you do with the recording?
I gave it to my new best friends.
And they'II be here any second.
You went to Pickar, didn't you?
And you sent that agent
at Coos Bay, didn't you?
But I didn't tell him to attack you.
Well, you're very thoughtful.
But you always were thoughtful,
weren't you?
AII right, basketcase.
Where's my money?
I think it's a mistake.
We've been over this before.
It's my job.
It's your job pulling your daughter
out of school,
away from her friends,
moving us to God knows where?
Okay, everybody ready for cake?
Okay, you've got to make a wish.
Yay. Okay. Everyone sing.
Look, I just need to know
that you're safe.
And how am I supposed
to knoW you're safe?
Hey, I can take care of myself, right?
But I married you to take care of us.
We'II be okay.
I don't want to be away
from you for a year.
What if something happened to you?
Hey, stop that now.
When this is over, I promise
I'II come in and do a 9:00 to 5:00.
I love you.
If that money doesn't eventually
show up, I'm dead.
Did you do it?
The wife's car is rigged to blow
the next time she starts it.
Good, that should get his attention.
AII right, who wants cake?
Got one more for you.
Here you go.
You like it?
Yeah, I love it.
I love it, Daddy.
So...
for the last time,
what did you do with the money?
Come on, you know you lose.
Whoa!
Don't!
Don't let go.
Please.
Help me.
You help me, you help yourself.
Don't you understand?
You help me, you help yourself.
Tom, don't let go.
Please, pull me up.
Did you do it?
The wife's car is rigged to blow
the next time she starts it.
Good, that should get his attention.
Now I know why I couldn't
remember who l was.
It was too hard to remember
what I lost.
Please, don't.
Don't!
You okay?
We got the phone
and I heard the call.
We got enough to indict Mason.
You're too late.
Too late? Too late for what?
They're dead.
AII of them?
No, Tomashevsky is gone.
He acted in self-defense.
If he acted in self-defense,
then why is he running?
That's what I've been
trying to figure out.
Sir, Agent Reese
and Daniels are deceased.
- Tomashevsky?
- No sign.
- Keep looking.
- Sir.
You're not gonna find him.
Your car was impounded.
Let me give you a lift.
Hello?
Dr. Bishop,
this is Tom Tomashevsky.
Tom.
You know you've been totally
cleared of everything?
The Bureau just wants
their money back.
They're gonna
get their money back.
If you ever need me,
l'm here for you.
Tom,
have you come to grips
with who you are?
I'm still not 1 00% sure who I am.
But I remember what I've got to do.
