AN UNFORGETTABLE SUMMER
Mount Fuji.
That's what Mother called the hill
opposite our home.
Mother embellished everything.
She had a Mozartian nature.
Gee up!
Gee up!
Come on!
See? I caught the ferry.
I told you I'd make it!
Will you take me to the ball?
Why won't you answer me, Spayu?
Listen, old man,
if you don't introduce me,
I'll shoot myself.
I'm sick of these Bulgarian yokels,
these peasants and smugglers.
What I need is
plenty of civilisation.
- What'll you give me?
- Champagne.
Alright then,
as long as it's Lili's.
- I'll have to pay!
That's the one I like.
Gentlemen,
you were told it was closed.
- Were you not?
- We stay put!
This is our place of work.
Not happy?
Go fuck yourself!
Go fuck yourself, you fool!
Shut it, or Bela Kun will put flowers
on your grave.
I'll wait downstairs.
This place is closed.
Doctor!
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Here's your licence.
You can open in 2 days.
Tomorrow is Sunday!
I'll miss the fair days.
Orders are orders, madam.
You'll spend 2 days at the fishery.
The workers will pounce on us.
And it's full of mosquitoes.
That's for sure.
I'm not such a bad sort.
I'll return your key. Here.
Lock them in their rooms.
Two days!
Don't let them out.
They can pee in a pot.
They must not be seen,
or there'll be hell to pay. Clear?
We're closing the establishment.
For God's sake!
Please leave now
or I'll fetch the General.
That's enough!
The fun is over.
The girls must not stand
by the windows.
Watch that Hergie.
She's barmy.
Barmy, me?
I'm not the barmy one around here.
Fuck your mother!
Go fuck yourself, bastard.
Your mother's crazy,
son of a bitch!
Tanza. Come see, Tanza.
- The General is so handsome!
- Isn't he?
He wanted to pay me by the hour!
Natsuku, Manelu,
Michu, my dear Miki.
- No. It isn't Miki!
- What?
It is! It's Miki.
- Dismarescu the prosecutor.
- Prosecutor my arse!
He only gets an erection
with the gramophone.
There's the prince. Hergie!
Come and see your prince.
Wait a minute!
Damn this skirt.
- Come on, Hergie! Come on!
- Hurry!
Hergie, get a move on!
- Hurry up!
- I'm going to give him an eyeful.
That's Hergie's bottom.
Get rid of that.
Sort the matter out at once.
Boyars to the gallows!
I'm going to cut their balls.
Long live the revolution!
Hurrah for Bela Kun!
We're here and we're staying!
We're here and we're staying!
Bella Boquet. Why...
Why did you...
Having a beautiful bottom
does not mean you can mock
the Rumanian army.
We didn't make Rumania great
for you to make fun of it.
My God, what a woman!
Don't you agree?
I want a girl like her.
Too good for you.
Telescope is wooing her,
but her husband, Petrica,
is so jealous.
He would challenge
the General to a duel.
Have you seen their horses?
I want some.
- You want so many things.
- Look.
She scratched my hand.
It's swollen.
Bloody whore!
What a crowd!
Enough to drive one mad,
my dear Helena.
This dump is enough
to depress one.
I find Paris as boring, Serban.
We're late, Aunt Hélène.
We were waiting for you.
The dancing has already begun.
Is that so?
You see no difference with Paris?
No. I see no difference.
No real difference.
No difference at all.
What a wonderful soirée!
Thank you so much.
- I'm delighted.
- I'd do anything for you, my dear.
Tili thinks I'm throwing the ball
for him, but it's for you.
In your honour.
So you can meet
whomsoever you like.
The little peacock!
He has gone to fan his tail.
Who is that charming creature?
You don't know?
She's your niece, my dear.
The daughter of
our dear sister Sophie,
from her first marriage.
You don't say!
Maria-Theresa von Debretsy.
Hasn't it a charming ring?
She doesn't look like us.
She has her mother's eyes.
The rest is her father.
Carol von Debretsy,
the Empire's military attaché
in London.
That is where
his daughter was born.
Broke and arrogant.
He shared his property
with the peasants,
but that did not stop him
being killed in Budapest
during the communist plague.
She was luckier, though.
She was rescued
just before being raped
by our Ustase liberators,
by an archangel.
And who is this archangel?
Captain Dumitriu.
- That small man?
- What a good guess!
The scrawny man
standing next to her.
Naturally,
she became Mrs Dumitriu.
He gave her 3 brats.
She learnt Rumanian,
which she speaks perfectly,
albeit with a hint
of an Oxbridge accent.
She has never mentioned
the fact we are related.
As arrogant as her father!
Dear Helena,
your ball is unforgettable,
a genuine success.
Allow me to offer you this flower.
You will not get off so lightly.
The soirée is to make
your stay less tiresome.
But I also have a favour
to ask of you.
- You had better not refuse.
- You offend me.
On one condition.
Tell me quickly, I'm dying of thirst.
I could murder a glass of wine.
Right. César, my nephew,
the son of my brother Serban,
is in the 16th cavalry regiment.
Discharge him!
To hell with your military service!
It's a trifle. You bring out
the artillery to kill a fly.
Hey, Prince, come here!
Come over here!
Prince, come here!
Excuse me.
You will have to
excuse him for a while.
Discharge Private Laskari
from the 16th cavalry.
Discharged!
He may return to his dear parents,
the poor yokels.
Listen up, dear man.
If you put a monocle in your rear,
you'd be a marvellous telescope.
And if you looked in my arsehole,
you would see
I always face the enemy.
Oh, how I like that fool!
- Forgive me. Is he a cousin?
- No.
You aristocrats are all related.
Not to him.
I like him even if he is a fool.
I didn't expect to find
someone like you
in this godforsaken place.
Do you remember
when I first saw you?
- Sir!
- Yes.
I was out riding by the Danube.
You were with the children,
in their pram.
- There was another woman.
- The nanny.
I said to myself,
"I don't know who the father is,
"but the mother is remarkable."
Then I saw you riding with Petrica.
I understand.
I've rarely seen a woman
ride like you, I swear.
I used to work in a circus.
In Budapest.
That's where Petrica bought me.
I believe you're making fun of me.
No. I used to jump through
hoops of fire.
You're related to the Laskaris,
aren't you?
A great lady.
400. And you?
I would like to see you again.
There will be other parties
at Mrs Vovediane's.
But I would like to see you soon.
I'm awfully busy.
The house, the children.
Wait till they're older.
I shall go out more.
I'll be delighted to see you.
When?
When the children have grown.
But that won't be soon.
In 5 or 10 years.
Did you win or lose?
I lost.
My stole!
Turn around, Wassily.
No, leave it.
A poor person will find it.
I shan't be able
to buy you another soon.
Carry on, Wassily.
I intend to request a transfer
to another garrison or corps.
Why?
You are happy here
and highly regarded.
Your superiors appreciate you.
I shall request a transfer
to another garrison.
Do you have any objections?
No, darling.
Actually, maybe it is better.
We're so happy together.
Yes.
Oh, the sweethearts!
Next time,
I shall cut off his ear in a duel.
On what will he hang his monocle?
I will send his wig flying
with my sword.
- He wears a wig?
- As if you cannot tell.
He's so tight-arsed.
Tight-arsed!
My mind is made up.
Please request my transfer
to another garrison or corps.
- My decision...
- Very well, I shall.
Border control?
Put on Colonel Gutsa.
Not Lutsa or Putsa, you fool. Gutsa!
Hello, Colonel Gutsa?
Listen, Colonel,
we haven't replaced the officer...
What was his name?
The officer killed by smugglers.
That's it, him.
The man whose lips
were slit with a bayonet.
I'm sending Captain Dumitriu
from division HQ.
Yes.
He's to man the border post.
Yes, that's right.
Intensive programme.
Come on, hurry up!
Be careful with the trunk.
Eros, Eros, come here!
Get a move on!
Come on.
Follow me with the trunk.
Carefully!
Sorry you married me?
We won't be here forever.
I like it here.
Eva.
What are you doing?
Wake up!
Unload! Hurry up!
Eros, why's he allowed?
Eros is a dog.
You are not a dog.
When I'm big, I'll be a dog.
Mummy, stop!
Stop, darling,
you'll give her bad habits.
What do you expect, Petrica?
He's my lover!
The orderlies are watching us.
So?
Come, I have chocolate.
Chocolate, chocolate!
Hey, gently!
You clumsy oafs, mind the trunk!
Gently!
The other way up!
Be a darling and help.
I can't manage on my own.
See, you and I have
the same blue eyes.
- Mine are hazel not blue.
- You have blue eyes.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Mirrors don't lie.
It's a lying mirror!
A Venetian mirror.
We both have blue eyes.
I'll smash it!
Let's say I have blue eyes.
- The children are next door.
- So?
Come on, Petrica, behave!
One, two, three!
Mummy, Mummy!
You're mine!
All mine!
Mummy, play for us.
Come on, Mummy.
Play something for us.
Blasted Magyars!
Don't fret about it.
We don't care.
A child must've thrown a stone.
You give them chocolate
and they throw stones.
Stop it, you grump,
you're always grumbling.
Have you forgotten?
It was a mirror that lied.
I told you I wanted to smash it.
My respects, madam.
Welcome, Captain.
Glad to have you.
Attention!
About turn, left!
Who ordered the attack?
Which idiot fired?
Stupid cretin!
You wanted to warn them?
You should be court-martialled!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Sir!
Evacuate the wounded to Calarasi.
Allow me, Captain.
Did you know Commander Issaya,
your predecessor?
He had an 11-year-old girl too.
Here's how they cut his lips
with a bayonet.
They cut your lips
and throw them to the pigs.
So the pigs can eat them!
My respects, madam.
Stop. Fall out!
Come here.
- Admiring the landscape?
- I like it.
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Mount Fuji.
Yes. It's very beautiful.
Come and have a shower, sir.
And what have you been playing, eh?
You've stopped crying, eh?
I made a lovely castle,
but he ruined it.
She ruined it too!
My respects, madam.
Blasted Magyar!
My back too, you fool.
These tomatoes are tasteless.
The water isn't fresh.
Don't sulk!
Don't regret you married me.
We shan't stay long.
I like it here.
I'm happy to be here.
The land here is real,
as are the men.
Like in Tolstoy's tales
about the Caucasus.
So why leave?
Everything will be fine.
We're together.
Hang the rest!
Let's drop it.
Finished.
Finished.
Finished!
These tomatoes are inedible.
What's wrong with them?
Why is that?
They need more water.
The drought.
I'll send the soldiers
to water the tomatoes.
That'll be one improvement
in this dump!
Finished!
What's he saying?
What did he say?
Mummy!
Come on, Mummy, smile.
Smile, Mummy.
Come and show me
your Mount Fuji.
Who goes there? Come here!
Come here!
What the hell are you doing, eh?
No, no, Lieutenant.
Don't hit me, sir!
Attention!
What's he doing?
Fucking stand to attention!
Obey my order, soldier.
Stand to attention!
Did you hear me?
- You stupid bloody shit!
- Don't hit me!
Stand to attention!
- Lieutenant!
- Yes, sir!
Lieutenant Torturianu!
Yes, sir!
Report to my office.
Yes, sir.
Calm down.
Sit down!
Mr Torturianu,
I forbid you to hit the soldiers.
I shall not tell you again!
I intend to take action.
Sir, I hit that soldier
for pissing on the wall
instead of using the WC.
That's no reason to hit him!
He wasn't to know.
You have been drinking.
You're a disgrace.
I'm confining you for a week.
Drink on leave
as much as you like.
In every unit I've served in,
the men were beaten.
Not in the unit I'm in charge of!
Goodnight. Fall out.
Yes, sir.
Go to hell!
You won't be in charge soon.
Damn bloody Hun!
Obey!
Take him on patrol.
He can piss in the Danube
as much as he likes.
Come on, move it.
Hurry up!
Hey, get your kit, you!
Move it, move it, move it!
The man's a brute.
Just forget about it.
What can you expect?
When you marry a soldier...
Did you need to marry a soldier?
You can be so stupid,
Captain Dumitriu.
Don't smoke so much,
it's bad for you.
- Hey, Jean, he'll screw you!
- He'll screw you.
He'll fuck his mother!
I've only two months to go.
Then I'll be free!
Oh, Jean!
Hey, Captain!
The alarm's been raised.
- Petrica! You're wanted.
- What is it?
- You're wanted.
- What?
What's got into you?
Stop bugling!
What is it? Is there a fire?
- Torturianu!
- Sir!
Fetch the machine gun,
the horses and the cart.
Fall in! And be quick about it.
Fall in!
Attention!
Look at your uniform!
Get your gear.
Get a move on!
The horses, you clots!
Line up. Now!
Come on, move it!
Your trousers!
Attention!
Forward, march!
And the rifles!
Where are the rifles?
- Eva! Are the children awake?
- No, they're asleep.
What happened?
Some smugglers were spotted.
And the Captain...
Is that where he went?
Yes. To the border.
He won't find them.
They strike and vanish.
It's impossible to catch them.
Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
have pity on us.
He got scared and fired!
- Which imbecile fired?
- Mr Torturianu!
Go to the stables.
Get out the other cart!
Go fetch some blankets
from the shed.
Come and give us a hand.
Give me that blanket.
Get the cart out of the stables.
We'll put them in. Come on!
What are you looking at?
There's nothing to see!
Get lost!
You too, do you hear? Go.
Go away!
Move along! Did you hear me?
Don't stay here, madam.
Like this, to the left.
Come on! More to the left.
There!
That'll teach you a lesson,
you rookies!
Do you think they'll feed us?
The dead men's meal!
It's better to see God
with a full belly.
Think they'll shoot us?
Shoot us, shoot us...
Fucking shut up!
Children, there you are!
Hello!
You're pretty, you are.
How old are you?
Ah, sonny, no!
How old are you?
You're a pretty girl too.
Come on, give it back.
I'm going to tickle you!
What's your name, then?
And you, sonny?
Don't you worry.
We won't hurt them.
What are those peasants
doing in the garden?
Watering it.
It's to keep them busy.
- Why are they here?
- We arrested them.
They're not involved
with the smugglers.
They cross the border at night
and come right back.
The local police force
are very self-important.
They find scapegoats
and send them to me.
I have to question them
and open cases.
- What happened?
- What do you think?
They attacked the outpost
and killed the soldiers.
How many?
Eight.
What is it to you?
You have the children, books,
your harpsichord,
which we lugged here.
Last night,
I heard the soldiers talking.
What about?
About what they saw.
They mutilate the dead
and the living.
You saw that?
You shouldn't have.
Because Sofia wants Dobruja.
Our government,
which took the south from Bulgaria,
refuses to give it back!
They're all the same, darling.
Ten years ago,
fresh out of the military academy,
I fought in this very spot.
We took them by surprise
while the Bulgarians surprised
the Greek army
with which they had surprised
the Turkish army,
and the Turks etc., etc., etc.
Did you ask the peasants
to work for us for free?
I'll pay them.
I have to go.
The police are waiting.
They haven't eaten since yesterday.
Hello, my friends!
Were you given any lunch?
No, madam, nothing at all.
- Why is she asking us?
- It must be the dead men's meal.
So we see God
with fully bellies.
Help yourselves.
Please help yourselves.
Come along,
please help yourselves.
Thank you, but you needn't have.
We'll be off home soon.
Help yourselves anyway.
Better to travel on a full belly.
Help yourselves.
- God bless you.
- Come on, my friends.
- God bless you.
- Thank you, madam.
- Help yourselves.
- God bless you.
Thank you, madam.
God bless you.
And I want you to know
my husband will pay you.
Why pay us?
We're already paid!
Madam, it isn't necessary.
Yes, Dimitar, it is.
This is something else entirely.
When I come to visit you,
you'll give me cheese,
bread and red wine.
It will be waiting for you.
I insist on paying for your labour.
And there are no buts.
Cheers!
To your health!
Since we're here why not work?
We'll do a good job,
like for ourselves.
Hey, you Bulgarians,
look over here.
Do as the soldier says.
Go on.
You lot, come closer.
You'll catch a cold in the shade.
Mind the lettuces.
Get a move on. Hurry up.
Come on, over here!
There. Sit down.
Closer together,
closer together!
They're not very bright,
these Bulgarians.
Look at me.
No, don't hit me, sir!
They're disciplining him.
- What's that?
- I asked if they beat him.
- And did they?
- Same as everyone.
But he scares easily.
Here, Petco.
Why do they beat us, madam?
We're simply obeying.
Under the Bulgarians,
it was taxes and army.
And now we're Rumanian,
it's the same story.
Why are you lying? Why?
As a young boy,
I sang to the Bulgarian tsar.
The Rumanians were bad.
And now my children sing
to the Rumanian king.
The Bulgarians are bad.
What do they want from us?
Tsar Ferdinand, King Ferdinand,
it's all the same to us.
The smugglers are Macedonians.
But they speak Rumanian.
That man being thrashed
only speaks Turkish.
He's Turkish!
- Well, goodnight, my friends.
- Goodnight, madam.
Go on, Christo.
Tell me about it after.
You two, come over.
Guard the other end of the yard.
If anyone approaches,
shoot without hesitation.
Mr Torturianu,
eat then report back.
Yes, sir!
You're still up?
Aren't you eating tonight?
No, not hungry.
I'll have a bit of salad.
Don't you like the lettuce?
I do like it, I do indeed.
Go to bed.
I still have things to do.
Why did you beat them?
Damn it!
The orders are to shoot them.
What do you mean?
To have them shot!
I send them into the woods
and have them shot.
In retaliation.
To teach the smugglers
to behave themselves.
I know very well it's no!
But I'm an officer.
An officer obeys
his superiors' orders.
Petrica...
Leave me be. I know all that.
I need to think.
Yes!
Captain, telephone!
The regiment is asking for you.
Get lost!
Go on, get out of here.
Get out of here, for God's sake!
Do you hear?
We told you to get out of here!
Hello, Captain Dumitriu?
Hello, Captain Dumitriu?
Where the hell is he?
Hey children, don't stay here!
Captain Dumitriu.
At your orders, Colonel.
What's going on?
Have you executed my orders?
I await your orders in writing.
Are you mad?
Execute my orders at once
and report to my office.
Before or after the execution?
After, after.
I await your orders in writing.
Go to hell!
Squad, stand to attention!
Bugle boy, wake up!
Leap forward! Down!
Leap forward! Down!
Gather at the starting point!
And be quick about it!
About turn!
Down!
- Water the roots.
- They're going to shoot us.
Hang the roots!
- Like this?
- That's it.
Shoot us, shoot us!
Shut it, bird of misfortune.
Yes, that's it.
Water the roots.
And you'll see,
it'll grow and grow.
Christian, Betty, inside.
Mummy is calling.
Are you still afraid of us, madam?
Off you go,
your mummy's calling you.
Why would I be afraid?
If he wants to be a gardener,
I'll let him.
Hey you, get out of here!
It's better than being a soldier.
I don't want to!
Go away! Go away!
Just get lost!
- Is she your wife?
- Yes, she is.
- She's beautiful.
- You can say that again.
But she can't speak.
She just says my name. Petco.
- Why are we prisoners?
- You're not prisoners!
- What will they do?
- Nothing. They'll let you go.
- Back to your wives.
- I think not.
If you knew
how they shouted at us.
They're letting you go
and sending you home.
Then you can come back.
Or rather, some of you.
They'll tend the garden,
as day labourers.
We'll come back.
I'd like that.
Why do they have bayonets?
Why can't our wives stay?
You don't know soldiers.
They're jealous types.
They're furious because
the smugglers killed their comrades.
The smugglers are Macedonian.
We're Bulgarian.
Yes.
- Where are you going?
- Go away!
Want to get shot, do you?
Want him to shoot you?
Go away!
You lot, get lost.
What are you waiting for?
Get lost!
What is going on?
You want an order from the Colonel?
And in writing?
Yes, sir.
I'm giving it to you.
Don't demand it in writing.
I wish to inform you
I need it in writing.
- Who do you...
- Leave us, Colonel.
I'll speak to him.
Look, dear man,
do you realise
you're jeopardising your career?
You're a remarkable,
intelligent, educated officer,
which is sadly rare
in the Rumanian army.
You studied in Germany,
attended the academy
and you are up for promotion.
Soon you will lead a regiment.
In war, you will be a general,
division or corps commander.
With your Germanic mind,
I can easily see you
as a chief of staff, at my age.
Your wife has influential relatives.
Is the Laskari family
not in the Queen's inner circle?
You have the scruples
of an adolescent
who indulges in masturbation.
However, if you refuse,
you can forget about promotion.
You will not command
in this army.
Not even a regiment.
And you, an officer capable
of leading great units
in memorable battles,
will grow old disgracefully
under the command
of a cretin like him.
I'm warning you,
all the idiots will be promoted
and pip you to the post.
You will have to deal
with boots and puttees
rather than having your name
go down in history.
Very well.
I'll give you till this afternoon.
I think we deserve lunch.
Where can one eat well, Captain?
And how is your wife?
Allow me to invite you
and the Colonel.
My wife will be delighted.
With pleasure.
And think hard.
You have a swarm of children.
You will take
the obvious decision.
I understand perfectly.
I will take the obvious decision.
It is an extraordinary region,
an extraordinary people.
The landscapes are extraordinary.
There is an example.
Mont Fuji.
Is it not beautiful?
It is far more beautiful
than Mount Fuji.
The Danube at Dobruja is prettier
than in the Black Forest?
But it is, I assure you.
A thousand times prettier.
As for the inhabitants...
Bravo, bravo!
Heat that, Colonel?
And you, a real Rumanian,
wish to be in the capital?
They live comfortably.
You have a harpsichord.
A harpsichord.
It's for taming the barbarians.
Music changes mores.
The smugglers are in need of it.
A toast, gentlemen.
To the woman
who tames the barbarians
and turns barren land
into lush gardens.
What woman wants,
God wants, Colonel.
In fact, this lettuce,
which by the way
I would love more of,
is proof of that.
It is absolutely delicious.
Excellent lettuce,
woman of Dobruja.
There's quite a story behind it,
I can tell you.
We would not have had any,
as the plants were wilted
before we got here.
But fortunately,
there were all these Bulgarians.
They watered them.
Wassily,
have you fed the Bulgarians?
Yes, madam.
You take care of those...
You have sympathy for them?
For those who are unhappy
on this land.
You might spare a thought
for our poor dead soldiers.
Has anything been done
for their families?
Who looks after their families?
The government, madam.
Our government.
It is none of your concern, madam.
And the men behind us,
who looks after them?
After all, they are Rumanian.
In the event of war,
they serve in the Rumanian army.
Who takes care of them?
The government
takes care of them too.
It takes care of them.
Thank you for lunch, madam.
I hope to see you soon.
Captain, I expect you in 10 minutes.
Talk to him, madam.
Make him see reason.
He's terribly stubborn.
You Bulgarian, get to work!
Go on, grab the shovel.
Come on, water the garden.
And be quick about it.
Come on.
It wasn't up to him.
The War Minister
phoned Chilibia,
who called Telescope,
who called the Colonel.
It isn't in writing.
What are you going to do, Petrica?
Mount Fuji!
Shit, shit, shit!
What a pretentious young madam.
And she's Magyar.
Don't pass up this opportunity.
Confidential report:
Telescope is furious.
He's seeing red.
Go on, it's in the bag!
- I get it. Leave me alone.
- Go on, off you go.
Tight arse!
Mount Fuji!
Tight arse!
Tight arse!
Busy.
The General is busy.
Yes, Captain!
Captain, kindly order your wife
to change her attitude
towards our enemies
and also your superiors.
I wish to inform you
that as my wife is not
a member of the division,
she is not obliged
to obey orders.
Is she obliged to discuss with you
whether to obey orders?
I wish to inform you that no.
I discuss orders with no one.
I execute them.
There. That's better.
Bravo. Excellent.
You're rather complicated, dear man.
How will you deal with the matter?
Not that it is any of my business.
You have free rein.
Telephone me
after executing the order.
I shall want a written report.
Escape attempt
following smugglers' attack...
Etc., etc., etc.
No, sir!
I wish to remind you,
I need the order in writing.
I see. That is where we are at.
Are you making fun of me?
Colonel, he is no longer in charge.
Henceforth,
the Lieutenant will do his job.
As for you, Captain,
you are dismissed.
Present arms!
Ground arms!
Mummy, Mummy!
Come here!
Come here at once!
Christian, Betty!
Where are you taking us?
Come on, don't argue.
Come on, fall in! Fall in!
Get a move on. Closer together.
You Bulgarians, forward march.
We're taking you home.
Mummy!
Please, darling.
Don't take us.
- Don't kill us.
- We're innocent.
Shut it, you!
Sir, don't take us.
He's Turkish.
Why are you taking him?
Are Turks worth less?
- Don't take us!
- Stop your snivelling.
Your kind killed our men.
Get up,
or I'll kick you in the arse.
Get up!
- We have children.
- So did our men!
Come on, get up. Get up!
Be a man.
Show a bit of courage.
Come along!
My friends, my friends!
Madam, don't abandon us!
They're taking us to our death.
I forbid you to speak to them.
Why get into such a state, Petco?
Where are you going, lads?
I haven't paid you.
I was clear.
You understand Rumanian.
They're going to kill us!
- Don't be so childish.
- They're going to kill us!
Why kill you?
You haven't done anything.
I'm not allowed to speak to you
but listen carefully.
Once you're released, come back
and I shall pay you.
You'll have everyone's pay.
I need workers
for the vegetable garden.
I'll come back.
Come along.
- Stop begging them.
- Shut it, shut it!
Come on, move it!
Thank you, madam.
Get going.
Faster, come on. Move it.
Look lively!
Come on, move it.
Move it, fatso.
What are you looking at?
Look lively!
Come on, faster.
Faster, faster.
This lettuce is wilted and rotten.
It's only fit for the pigs.
They can eat it!
Your service record, Captain,
says you're capable.
- Is your wife a communist?
- General?
Are you deaf, Captain,
or being stupid?
Must I repeat myself?
Is your wife a Bolshevik?
I wish to inform you
I do not understand.
My wife's mother...
Are you acting stupid
or are you dumb?
I'm interested in your wife!
Where did you meet?
In 1919, in Budapest,
you were in my division.
There was a revolution.
We burnt the red flag
of Bela Kun, did we not?
No. My wife is not a communist.
Her mother...
Screw her mother!
For God's sake,
why does she defend those yokels?
Here are two confidential reports.
There are two bastards
in my company.
It isn't your company anymore.
The bastard is the officer
who married a Magyar,
the sworn enemy of our nation!
My wife's mother...
...an order from the government.
I'm in a fix.
The ministry wonders,
"Among Chilibia's men,
are there cases of insubordination?"
- My wife's mother...
- You will be court-martialled.
Your file will be so full
of negative remarks
that you'll run from one garrison
to another like a top,
with broken furniture
and empty trunks.
You have a harpsichord?
Don't touch it!
It belongs to my...
I don't give a fuck
about your harpsichord!
I'll tell your superiors
to give you hell.
They'll have your guts for garters.
When you retire,
you'll still be a dumb captain,
a stupid old fogey!
I wish to inform you
my wife is not Magyar.
Her mother is Sophia Laskari,
a Rumanian boyar.
You don't say!
What's her father's name?
Who cares?
Her mother is Sophia Laskari!
Go to hell, you fool!
- May I...
- Get out of here!
Do you want it in writing?
With all due respect, sir.
I have been meaning
to ask you this for a while.
Hergie...
You know, Hergie the whore.
Is she not well acquainted
with Marie-Thérèse Dumitriu?
They belong to the same branch.
I mean, from the same town.
Budapest.
What's wrong?
Want to challenge me to a duel?
I'm sorry, Captain.
It will be our little secret.
It's mere curiosity.
Maybe I shouldn't have.
But don't take it badly.
I can apologise.
Accept my apologies.
You are to join
the 90th infantry regiment.
Goodnight.
You are dismissed.
Petco. Petco!
Faster, Wassily!
Come on!
Mummy,
when will Petco come back?
Take him.
Run!
"Mummy?"
"Mummy,
when will Petco come back?"
I asked the next day
and the day after.
My mother did not reply.
Then she took to drink
and I forgot about Petco.
But I never forgot that summer.
It was an extraordinary summer.
The best summer of my childhood.
