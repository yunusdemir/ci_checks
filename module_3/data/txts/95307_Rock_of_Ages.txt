I leave that to you. You're a musician,
so it's important that you suffer.
I'm talentless,
so suffering's wasted an me.
- When was the last time you suffered?
- Six o'clock this evening...
...when I gut up for work.
Say I spend my money
On women and wine
But I couldn't tell you where
I spent last night
I'm really sorry about the shape I'm in

<i>Ain't look:'n' for noth:'n' but a good time</i>
And it don't get better than this

Oh, my Gad.
Lack, I'm sorry this happened. It sucks.
I'm Drew.
Sherrie.
"The Bourbon Roam"?
- You work at The Bourbon Room?
- Yeah. I'm a barback.
One of these days,
my name's gonna be up there.
- You're in a band?
- I'm a singer.
Get cut! Me tan.
Oh, my God. The Bourbon Room. I have,
like, 10 albums that were recorded there.
More like "had"?
Had.
Yep.
Well, thank you.
Thanks.
Again.
Don't go in there, it's filth!
- Hey.
- Don't join them!
Dc you need ajab?
I could talk to Dennis Dupree, my bass.
Pray you'll be saved!
Are you serious?
Just whatever you do,
don't tell him you're a singer.
Jimmy!
I told you 10,000 times.
Girls drink free, dudes pay full freight.
They are dudes.
Lack, I haven't charged a girl since '13.
For a minute, I thought that
Kate Jackson from Charlie's Angels...
-...had walked into my club.
- More like Michael Jackson.
- Doesn't he lack pale to you?
- He does a bit.
Dennis! Meet Sherrie.
She needs a job, man.
Na, I don't think so. She's a singer.
No, she just came in
from out of town.
Oh, okay, now, if I may.
- You sang in the church chair every Sunday.
- Lutheran.
Senior year, you had the third lead
in your high school musical.
- Sound of Music.
- And then somebody...
...your adorable Aunt Betty,
told you you had real talent.
- It was actually my Aunt Doris.
- Uh-huh.
And like a flaming dipshit you believed her,
dumped yourjock boyfriend...
...ditched town and moved to Hollywood
to have a crack at fame and fortune.
Am I missing anything?
L...
Yeah, okay.
Actually, my boyfriend
wasn't really athletic.
And look. I'm a waitress.
Came an. She's practically
gut mike burns an her lips.
I'm not interested, sweetheart.
I need you two to get back to work.
- Please, Mr. Dupree. I'm a hard worker.
- You seem like a really nice kid.
I just gm mugged-
I have $17 to my name and I'm probably
gonna be starving in the next 48 hours.
- And Beth just quit.
- Beth just quit?
Okay, fine. You're hired.
Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
What are you thanking me for? I ruined
your life. You start training tomorrow.
This place is turning into a war zone.
It's Arsenal's last show.
Arsenal? Oh, my Gad, I lave Stacee Jaxx.
It's your lucky day. He's going sale.
Hey, want to go celebrate?
I'm coming up an my break.
Yeah. Sure.
A year Hga...
A year ago,
people asked whose campaign...
...I would throw
my financial support behind...
...and I knew there was only one man
an the ticket...
...that could restore the city
to its original glory.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mayor Mike Whitmore.
Thank you. Couldn't have done it
without you, Doug.
Ahh.
Thank you, Les Angeles.
You know, Doug Flintlock here...
well, he just leaned into my ear
and he said:
"Mike, I have kids. Teenagers.
And these days, I'm scared for them.
We need to clean up this city."
Well, I can tell you that...
...l, for one, am not scared
for our city's children.
And that's because
I have a secret weapon.
My rack.
My soul mate.
And the best darn wife
any man could hope to have.
Please welcome my wife:
The beautiful Patricia Whitmore!
Oh.
Came an up here, Patty-cake!
We did it!
Oh. Thank you.
Today, the city of Los Angeles
gets a twofer!
Nat only the best mayor this city
has ever had...
...but also me.
A mother.
So tomorrow, as part of my
"Clean Up The Strip" initiative...
...we start to make this city safe
again for our young people.
She lacks familiar to me, this woman.
She lacks eerily familiar.
You've probably popped something an
your ass that resembles her.
I shouldn't have thought so. That's all
cleared up nicely, thank you very much.
Rock 'n' roll is a disease.
But it is a disease with a cure.
You don't know her.
Man, back then, her husband,
Mayor Whitmore...
...used to be one of my best customers.
Wow. New lack at him.
Married to a woman
who lacks like she's been hibernating...
...in Margaret Thatcher's bumhale.
- Ofi our streets
and knock the sucker back...
What happens to people?
Don't know, Den.
Suppose they get corrupted
and seduced by the Man...
...get old and bitter and run for mayor.
Or they run a club,
live the rack 'n' roll dream...
...and get old and bitter that way.
Here's to rack 'n' roll.
Ta rack 'n' roll.
And let's reclaim the Strip for the
God-fearing citizens of Los Angelesi
I cannot believe
that I'm working at The Bourbon.
Thank you so much.
Don't even mention it.
Oh, my Gad.
Arsenal Live at The Bourbon.
- Hands dawn, favorite record ever.
- Me tan.
I would've killed to be at that concert.
That record really changed my life.
I decided if I couldn't see Stacee Jaxx...
...I was gonna be Stacee Jaxx.
<i>Bought a beat-up six string</i>
In a secondhand store
Didn't know how to play it
But I knew for sure
That one guitar
Felt good in my hands
<i>Didn't take long</i>
To understand
Just one guitar
Slung way down low
Was a one-way ticket
Only one way to go
<i>- So I started rockin</i>
<i>- Rock:'n'</i>
Ain't never gonna stop
No
<i>- Gotta keep on rockin</i>
<i>- Rock:'n'</i>
Someday I'm gonna make it to the top
And sing
I love rock 'n' roll
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I love rock 'n' roll
So come and take your time
And dance with me
In a town with no name
In a heavy downpour
Thought I passed my own shadow
By the backstage door
Like a trip through the past
To that day in the rain
And that one guitar
Made my whole life change
<i>And we'll be mow'n' on and s:'ng:'n'</i>
<i>That same old song</i>
<i>Yeah, with me</i>
<i>S:'ng:'n'</i>
And be a jukebox hero
So put another dime in the jukebox, baby
I'm a jukebox hero
So come and take your time
And dance with me
- Just-a one guitar
- Jukebox hero
<i>Got stars in my eyes</i>
- I'm just a jukebox hero
- Ah, ah, ah
- Jukebox hero
- Stars, stars
I love rock 'n' roll
- Jukebox hero
- Stars, stars
So come and take your time
And dance with me
DREW & SHERRIE
<i>Stars in our eyes</i>
I love rock 'n' roll
Whoa.
SHERRIE
Whew.
The problem is, I think I'll only ever
be good an ajukebax.
What do you mean?
I get stage fright.
You've gotta be kidding me.
Na.
You've gotta breathe.
I think I gut that part dawn.
Na, I'm serious, you've gotta breathe.
Like, takes away the nerves.
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.
Dc it a couple times. You'll be fine.
Maybe you should help me practice.
Are you asking me out an a date?
Yeah.
Then yes.
Coal.
Okay, well, I should probably check
into my motel and grab my stuff, 50...
Gotta get back to work.
- Okay, well, bye. Oh.
- Bye.
Bye. Oh. Ha-ha.
Surf!!-
Well, good night.
See you tomorrow, Mrs. Whitmore.
Mr. Whitmore. Call me.
Mm.
- Mike?
- Mm.
- Why so jumpy?
- Oh.
Well, it's just that Doug Flintlock.
He wants the Strip, Patty-cake,
and we have to deliver.
Of course we will, sweetheart.
H aw?
- We'll go after the head of the snake.
- Och.
- The Bourbon.
- Oh, right.
If we cut off the head, the Strip will die.
The Bourbon could be a Benetton
by the end of the month.
Me and the ladies
are going after all the church groups...
...ta make this happen.
We're even talking
to the Health Department.
We should review all their paperwork
for violations.
Oh, trust me...
...if we find so much as a hair
in a cocktail alive...
...we're shutting them dawn.
Hey, bass, we found some hairs
in the cocktail olives again.
Then rinse them off.
Okay.
Na!
Nobody puts Donkey in the corner!
- That game's tan bloody surreal anyway.
- Ugh!
Dennis, did you just sigh audibly? Why?
Taxes. They're so un-rack 'n' roll.
Cheer up, mate. You still gut
the twisted sisters of piety outside...
...all flustered and worked up,
so we must be doing something right, eh?
Well, at least we have
the Arsenal show coming up.
But that means our whale existence
is riding an Stacee Jaxx.
Stacee Jaxx, the mast unreliable man
in the music industry?
A man who blew off the halftime show
at the Super Bowl...
...ta attend a satanic ritual
to sew up Debbie Harry's vagina?
Please stop.
- The Satanists wouldn't even do that.
- You're not helping.
Why would the devil close vaginae'?
No one's qualified to do that.
Hand me the phone.
Let's do a telethon, because this might
work better than your Stacee Jaxx idea.
Shut it!
I'm calling Stacee's manager, Paul Gill.
- Ahem. Speak.
- Hello, Paul? It's Dennis Dupree.
Dennis. What's up, brother man?
Oh, I was just calling to check in
and see if we're still an for Friday.
Of course we are. Arsenal's last show.
We're kicking off Stacee's
solo press tour there.
Rolling Stone just confirmed.
They would like to interview him
an the premises, okay?
- What did he say?
- He told me to turn off the radio.
- Sn turn it off.
- The radio in his head!
- Calm dawn!
- Oh, Gad.
Paul?
Paul?
Paul?
- Paul?
- Oh, crap. Yeah, sorry, man.
Yeah. ls Stacee okay?
<i>Stacee ?</i>
He's fantastic. I'm lacking at him
right now. He's waving hello.
Yes, I'm talking to Dennis.
Oh-ha. He just flipped me off.
Same old Stacee. Right?
Okay, I gotta dash.
I'll talk to you Friday, babe, okay?
Put something an, man.
Banzai.
Jesus.
Stacee?
I didn't know you had a twin.
I don't.
Stacee.
You need to go an stage, man.
I am an stage, Paul.
Shit.
Take a good lack, ladies.
Take a hard...
...gaad, lung...
...hard...
look.
This man, this man is responsible
for so much filth.
- He's Satan.
- She is an extraordinary woman.
Such a beacon of courage.
He's like a machine
that spews out three things:
- Sex...
- Oh!
- ...hateful music...
- Oh.
...and...
...sex.
Can you came take some dictation
for me in the parish office, Ms. Hoyt?
Of course, sir.
My sun ate the head of my neighbor's
horse because of Stacee Jaxx.
Ugh. Well, his filthy little hateful music...
...sex ride is aver.
- Gotta stop!
- Yes.
And we're the ones who are gonna do it.
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
That's okay
Let's see how you do it
Put up your dukes
Let's get down to it
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
You come on with a come-on
You don't fight fair
That's okay
See if I care
Knock me down
It's all in vain
I'll get right back on my feet again
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Paw! Paw!
POW!
Well, you're a real tough cookie
With a long history
Of breaking little hearts
Like the one in me
Before I put another notch
In my lipstick case
You better make sure
You put me in my place
Hit me with your best shot
Come on!
Hit me with your best shot
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Hit me with your best shot
Why don't you hit me
With your best shot?
Hit me with your best shot
Fire away
Han!
- Ai! Jesus.
- Na, Chico. Jesus is my brother.
Oye, Dennis told me to tell you
to come in early tomorrow.
Yeah, sure. Whatever, man.
I need to go get ready. I have a big date
tonight with Sherrie. Wish me luck.
Yeah, whatever that means. Okay, bye.
So long
I've been looking too hard
I've been waiting too long
Sometimes I don't know
What I will find
I only know it's a matter of time
When you love someone
When you love someone
It feels so right
So warm and true
I need to know if you feel it too
Maybe I'm wrong
Won't you tell me
If I'm coming on too strong?
This heart of mine has been hurt before
This time I wanna be sure
Hey, girl.
<i>I've been wa:'t:'n' for a girl like you</i>
To come into my life
<i>I've been wa:'t:'n' for a girl like you</i>
A love that will survive
I've been wa:'t:'n' for someone new
To make me feel alive
<i>Yeah, wa:'t:'n' for a girl like you</i>
To come into my life
- Won't you come into my life?
- Won't you come into my life?
Wow. It's like a giant velvet blanket
covered in diamonds.
Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah, it's a little different
than Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Sn, what did your mam think
about the big move to L.A.?
She thought it was stupid.
My dad just totally didn't get it.
His advice:
"You're gonna fail anyway,
so why not fail closer to home?"
Okay. Total optimist.
What about your folks?
What did they think of the big move?
Um...
Not a whole lot really.
I was raised by my grandma.
Yeah, she, by the way,
was all for me getting out of Oklahoma.
- Really?
- Mm.
Yeah, she said to me:
"Haney, there ain't nothing for you here...
...and the last thing that I want you to do
is wind up stuck here like me."
Man, I adore her.
You're a nice guy, aren't you?
I try to be.
Why?
She wanted to know.
Oh, my Gad,
I can't believe I'm actually here.
I'm so hﬂPPY-
There's nowhere on earth
That I'd rather be
Than holding you tenderly
<i>- I've been wa:'t:'n' for a girl like you</i>
<i>- I've been wa:'t:'n' for a boy like you</i>
- To come into my life

Sherrie.
You are gonna sing

- Now, breathe!
- Hey.
Don't be nervous.
Okay, uh...
This is something I kind of started
working an after we met last night.
Just a small-town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train gain'
Anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
And it goes an and an and an.
Heh. I lave it.
It's so beautiful. I can't believe you
wrote that. It's amazing.

- He's better than Concrete Ballz.
- Goad paint.

Baby, baby, baby.
Came an, nobody cares

Okay.

The spotlight doesn't just light them up.
It makes us disappear.
You'll see.
Say:'n' "I love you
Is not the words
I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy
It would be to show me how you feel
More than words
Is all you'd have to do
To make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say
That you love me
'Cause I'd already know
- Hey, I'm gonna take my break.
- Okay.
<i>How I love the way you move</i>
And the sparkle in your eyes
There's a color deep inside them
Like a blue suburban sky
I don't need to be the king of the world
As long as I'm the hero
- Of this little girl
- Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Closer to it every day
- Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends say
- I know we're gonna find a way
- More than words
- Is all you have to do to make it real
- You have to do to make it real
- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Then you wouldn't have to say
- Heaven isn't too far away
- Heaven isn't too far away
Heaven isn't too far away
More than words
Yeah, heaven isn't too far away
More than words
'Cause I'd already

<i>Say:'n' "I love you</i>

Sc let's get moving.
Paul! Ha-ha.
You're early.
Actually, I told him the gig was last night,

Work, work, work.
Yes, you're an the air.
Hey, Stacee, you made it.
Hey Man.

Whoa! Whoa!
Thank you so much for doing this...
You and me.
Uh-huh.

Even the cockroaches gut burned

It's great to see your face-bane again.
- New let's burn this place to the ground.
- Yes.
Right an, brother. Rack 'n' roll.
Na. When I'm dune, we literally need
to burn this place to the ground.
Otherwise the fire phoenix gets trapped.
Yes, I suppose so.
Ha-ha. It's a joke. I'm kidding, man.
I mean, of course, you're not really gonna
burn the place down to the ground, right?
Na.
You can't trap a fire phoenix.
I mean, that'd be crazy, right?
It would be. Yeah.
I mean, seriously...
tonight, I am gonna light
this place on fire...
...far you...
...my rack 'n' roll brother.
- Uhn
- Sherrie!
Here we go.
Hey, Stacee. I got someone
I'd like you to meet, man.
This is Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.

You in there, man? Ha-ha-ha.
Say, superstar, rise and shine.
Constance Sack. Rolling Stone.
Stones.

Oh, Gad. Okay.
Five minutes and go.
Okay. Stacee Jaxx,
back at The Bourbon-
Na, nu, nu. Na.
New go.
Uh-- At The Bourbon, where it all started.
Your first album Stick Meat gave birth
to some of rock's greatest anthems.
And new a solo career. Why now?
Well, ahem...
...I think...
I think due to the changing nature
of the music industry...
...the change in cultural trends...
...and when you think of
blah-blah-blah and blah-blah-blah.
--You make sure that you wanna take in
blah-blah-blah. Ha-ha.
- Okay.
- Four minutes.
You know, some people have said that
you've became quite difficult to work with.
That you're constantly late, you're
reclusive, sometimes even nonsensical.
I wanna ask you this:
Have these people even met themselves?
Well, I'm talking about your band.
Let me tell you something.
I know me better than anyone...
...because I live in here.
- Eight minutes.
- You just said four.
- Three.
- But it--
Dc you think that it's possible...
...that you've shut out or alienated
so many people...
...that you had no other option
but to go solo?
You gotta be true to the muse. Hey Man.
Scotch me, little buddy.
And who is your muse? Ahem.
Right.
Fine.
- Barn Steven Jackson in Detroit, Michigan.

You know, you're not so weird.
You're just another lonely man
with many regrets.
I said time. You can go now.
Final question.
What happens when you realize
you can't get rid of Stacee Jaxx?
You have no idea what it's like to be me.
Well, then here's your chance.
What's it like to be the Stacee Jaxx?
KS all the same
Only the names will change
<i>Every day it seems we're wast:'n' away</i>
Another place
Where the faces are so cold
I drive all night just to get back home
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
Dead or alive
Wan ted
Dead or alive
Sometimes I sleep
Sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet
Always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day
By the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone
All you do is think
Dalai Lama.
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
Wanted
Dead or alive
Wan ted
Wanted
Dead or alive
Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee! Stacee!
Oh, and I ride
<i>Oh, when I walk these streets</i>
A loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps
'Cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere
Still standing tall
I've seen a million faces
And I've rocked them all
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wan ted
Wan ted
Dead or alive
Well, I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
I'm wan ted
Wan ted
Dead or alive
And I ride
And I ride
Dead or alive
I still drive
I still drive
- Dead or alive
- Dead or alive
I'm Stacee.
Sherrie.
Sherrie.
When my hamster died...
your music really helped me through.
You have such a perky...
...heart.
Thank you.
Dc me a favor.
Sure.
There's a cut-glass battle of Scotch
in the limo.
Bring it to my dressing roam?
Right away.
Now, Patricia, this is the third night
in a raw that you've been here.
- Why so passionate?
- Well, Mitch, this has to end.
We're calling on anyone with children
to join forces with us...
...and show up here every night...
...until the doors of these places
are closed for good.
Stacee Jaxx can wreck his awn life.
But when it comes to raping...
...the ears of our children
with this poison...
-...we have to fight!
- Well, they-
Rack 'n' roll is the only freedom
we have.
Stacee Jaxx is Gad!
Rock 'n ' roll forever! Waah!
Sniff the mike. Whoa!
I'm walking here! Whoa!
Okay, great interview.
I hope you gut everything.
- You're not a cowboy.
- Why don't you tell me what I am?
- You're a man-child stuck in a rut.
- I lave it when you talk dirty.
You used to be great. But whatever
made you that way, it's gone.
That's right. Give it to me rough.
You're another rocker
asleep at the wheel...
-...singing songs you wrote 10 years ago.
- Okay, lady.
As long as you've gut this manager
keeping you an the road...
...and doping you up with girls and booze
and million-dollar record deals...
...he's gonna keep you asleep
and drive your career off a cliff.
- Line crossed. Let's go, sweetheart.
- Don't touch me.
You used to write great songs.
Where are they now?
You know what? I'm calling your editor.
Close friend of mine, by the way.
- Rolling Stone magazine.
- Jann Wenner's office.
Get cut.
My wards exactly.
This interview is aver.
Na, nu, nu. Nat her.
You.
All of you.
Copy that. Everybody cut.
You know, I think you get
this sense of entitlement...
...due to the fact that you're a rack god.
But it's not real.
It's not lave.
Na.
It's not lave.
Then what is it?
Off the record?
Sex.
And other people's projections
of what they want me to be.
Of what you and all your readers
want me to be.
Sex.
And it keeps me from going cut...
...and getting the one thing
that could save me.
But I can't have that now.
I'm a slave to rack 'n' roll.
I am searching for the perfect sang...
...the perfect sound that will
make you wanna live forever.
Like I said:
I know me better than anyone
because I live in here.
And no one else can.
I can.
I can.
<i>I gotta take a little time</i>
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ooh, ahh, ahh
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If! can face it again
Can 't stop now
I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
- I wanna know what love is
- I wanna know what love is
- I want you to show me
- I want you to show me
- I wanna feel what love is
- I wanna feel what love is
- I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If! can face it again
I can'! stop now
Hey, man, have you seen Sherrie? Blan--?

The crowd was totally an their feet.
They loved it.
D rew?
D rew.
Can I help you?
What's wrung?
Why are you mad at me?
I'm not mad.
I'm celebrating a great gig.
Okay. Well, can you at least lack at me?
Why should I?
Huh?
I don't need you.
There are hundreds of "yous"
out there. And tonight?
They were all lacking at me.
The spotlight.
She was right.
Tell Dennis I quit.
Sherrie!
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Hey. Paul Gill.
I'm Stacee Jaxx's manager.
- You were fantastic tonight, man.
- Thank you, man. Thank you.
Let her go.
Let her go.
Let me ask you something:
What do Keith Richards, Jimmy Page...
...and Stacee Jaxx all have in common?
Broken hearts
and very, very long careers.
Now, you want lave? Ga after her.
You might even find it.
But I can guarantee you something
much more rare...
...and a lat more fun, man.
Stacee Jaxx and Arsenal!
What is that?
Fame.
<i>Love is like a bomb</i>
Bomb

Come and get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
<i>Look:'n' like a tramp</i>

Okay.
Why is everybody quitting today?
Who cares?
This is the greatest night of my life!
You got the peaches

Sweet to taste
Saccharine
'Cause I'm hot, say what
Sticky sweet
From my head

Crisis averted.
Thank you, Stacee Jaxx.
And Stacee Jaxx thanks you.
- Well, hello, Paul.
- Well, hello, Dennis. Lanny.
Now, hold an just a second.
We gut 90 percent of the house,
20 percent of the bar...
...100 percent of the merch.
That means that Stacee's take
works out to about...
Wait, wait, wait. "Stacee's take"?
Hold an. Add a zero. Add three.
Thirty-one thousand,
two hundred and nine. Correct?
- Yeah.
- Crap.
Crap. We gut a problem.
- What problem?
- Well, you awe me six bucks.
Ha-ha-ha. But screw it. Keep it.
I get fussy about singles anyway.
Paul, you told me this was a freebie.
Stacee Jaxx does not take a dump for free.
He tank a huge pay cut an this.
You are cutting my throat here!
Don't be so pessimistic.
Stacee just put you guys back an the map!
Na, nu. I put him an the map.
I beg your pardon.
I gave him his first gig.
And I gave him his first million.
Anyway.
Awesome doing business with you, ciao!
Didn't know Paul spake Italian.
Cry:'n' on the corner
Wa:'t:'n' in the rain
<i>I swear I'M never, ever wai t again</i>
You gave me your word
But words for you are lies
Darlin', in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know
I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna tum and leave you here
<i>AH of my fife I've been wa:'t:'n' in the rain</i>
I've been waiting for a feeling
That never, ever came
It feels so close
But always disappears
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>
Mm, mm, ah, ah
Oh
Darlin', in your wildest dreams
You never had a clue
But it's time you got the news
I'm gonna harden my heart
Harden your heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
Swallow your tears, girl
- I'm gonna tum
- Tum
- And leave you here
- Leave you here
Oh, like a candle
Cognac, brandy.
- Oh, nu, I don't mix my drinks.
- Na, nu, nu.
This is Cognac.
- She's getting you a brandy.
- Here you go, Justice.
- Thank you.
- New you drink up and dry off.
But remember:
This is just a rest stop.
I need a job.
Dc you dance?
You got the best of me
I'm a better singer.
I don't need a singer.
And you're a pretty girl. You wanna
make some real money, you gotta dance.
You also have to be tough too.
And you don't look too tough to me.
I'm tough.
It's not right for everyone, honey.
Hey there.
I can wait tables. I'm good.
Are you sure?
You're bringin' on the heartache
Can'! you see
Okay. You start tomorrow.
<i>You said, "Oh, girl</i>
<i>KS a cold world</i>
When you keep it all to yourself'
<i>I said, "You can't hide</i>
On the inside
All the pain you've ever felt"
You better ransom your heart
And, baby, don't look back
'Cause we got nobody else
We're running with the shadows
Of the night
So, baby, take my hand
It'll be all right
Surrender all your dreams to me tonight
They'll come true in the end
I'm gonna harden my heart
- Harden your heart, girl
- I'm gonna swallow my tears
Swallow your tears
I'm gonna tum and leave you
Darlin', in my wildest dreams
I never thought I'd go
But it's time to let you know
Oh, I'm gonna harden my heart
I'm gonna swallow my tears
I'm gonna tum and leave you here
Whitty.
What if I told you The Bourbon Room
hadn't paid taxes in over a year?
- Why do you ask?
- Because it's true.
They're brake. I am so excited.
I'm gonna call the press.
- Patty-cakes?
- Mm-hm.
I think this whale
"Cleaning up the Strip" thing...
...is gonna be great for the city
and for us.
But you seem to have this issue
with Stacee Jaxx.
I mean, it seems to be really intense.
Well...
- The short answer?
- Mm-hm.
When I was a naive undergrad at UCLA,
I had a roommate.
- Let's just call her Vivian.
- Oh.
One night she was partying innocently
at The Bourbon Room...
...when that two-headed monster
spotted her...
...and lured her into his suite
at the Park Hyatt.
For the first time...
...she felt like a woman.
Sure, a handcuffed woman covered in
Coal Whip and Wild Turkey, but still...
...3 WOMEN.
Yeah. A woman.
Well, you can guess what happened next.
His tour bus left L.A.,
taking Stacee Jaxx with it.
And I swore in her honor...
...that I would see him...
and his sick satanic legacy gone
for good.
That's the short answer?
Yeah.
<i>I don't know where I'm going</i>
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In the songs of yesterday
And I've made up my mind
lain'! wasting no more time
But here I go again
<i>Here I go again</i>
Though I keep searching for an answer
I never seem to find what I'm looking for
Oh, Lord, I pray
You give me strength to carry on
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
<i>And here I go again on my own</i>
Going down the only road I've ever known
<i>Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone</i>
And I've made up my mind
lain'! wasting no more time
I'm just another heart in need of rescue
Waitin' on love's sweet charity
And I'm gonna hold on
For the rest of my days
'Cause I know what it means
To walk along the lonely street of dreams
<i>And here I go again on my own</i>
Going down the only road I've ever known
<i>Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone</i>
And I've made up my mind
lain'! wasting no more time
But here I go again
<i>Oh, here I go</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>
<i>Here I go</i>
<i>Here I go again</i>
<i>Here I go</i>
Here {go
Here I go
<i>Here I go</i>
Hey. Came an, big fella.
We can sort this cut.
What part of "We're screwed"
don't you understand?
What part of "Rack 'n' roll is forever"
don't you understand?
This monument to decadence...
...can't be brought dawn by a few
plastic bureaucrats in bowler hats.
It's eternal.
I just feel like I've let everyone dawn.
Nat everyone.
What do you mean?
<i>I can't fight this feeling any longer</i>
And yet I'm still afraid to let it ﬂow
What started out as friendship
Has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength
To let it show
I tell myself that I can'! hold out forever
You're not fucking with me, are you?
<i>I said there is no reason for my fear</i>
This is a dream came true.
'Cause I feel so secure
When we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear
And even as I wander
I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window
On a cold, dark winter's night
- And I'm getting closer
- And I'm getting closer
- Than I ever thought I might
- Than I ever thought I might
- And I can't fight this feeling anymore
- And I can't fight this feeling anymore
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars forever
-'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
-'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
- I've forgotten what I started fighting for
- And if I have to crawl upon the ﬂoor
- And if I have to crawl upon the ﬂoor
Come crashing through your door
- Baby, I can'! fight this feelin' anymore
- Baby, I can'! fight this feelin' anymore
Hey, bass.
What is it, Chico?
- The beer guy is here.
- Tell him I'm busy.
Busy falling in lave.
- Let's go, Danny,
- Hey, you okay?
Oh, that? Don't sweat him.
That's just my ex, Danny.
Anyway, haw you holding up, baby?
I'd say men are pigs but that'd be
totally unfair to pigs, 50...
I gave up a long time ago
trying make men respectable.
There's only one place
you're gonna get respect in this joint.
You gut to take that stage aver there.
That stage is a pedestal.
And when you're up there,
you're untouchable.
And when you're up there,
you can have it...
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Take Destiny.
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
And Sapphire.
She loves to move
She loves to groove
She loves the Iovin' things
All night
All night
Oh, every night
There's one motto here.
So hold fight
- Hold fight
- Baby, hold fight
When it comes to the customer...
She said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it"
She said, "Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it"
Gentlemen, I bring you your next star.
Paul, you know I love you,
but it's a pass.
Shh.
Rack is dead, but the pap thing's hat.
<i>Hold on</i>
Hold on
Hold on
Does he rap?
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it

Oh, she said, "Any way you want it

<i>You got silky sheets</i>
Baby, put me underneath

- Pau I !
Cut! Cut! Cut!
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever dune. I can't do it.
What's your name, Jashy-Z?
I'm trying to make you lack coal.
I want you to lack funky fresh.
But you have to not suck the next take.
Back to one, everyone!
- I think we should take five, you know?
- First good idea I've had all day.
Take five, everyone!
This feels all wrung, Paul.
I'm telling you, this pap-band shit
is where everything is headed.
Just trust me. You're working
with tap, classy talent here.
Paul, I am Wolfgang Van Cult.
Nat Jashy-Z, nor the Z-Guyz.
Na, you are not the Z-Guyz either.
You are the Z-Guyeezz.
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.
- The "flavor"?
- Yes.
What does Z even stand far?
Nothing. You're aver-thinking it.
Names that end in Z are very popular
with the 14-to-21 year aids.
We did a whale focus group an this.
Numbers don't lie.
I don't want to do it, man.
I have had it up to here
with your negativity, Jashy-Z.
- And you know, Danny-Z and Kevy-Z and--
- Joey.
--Joey-Z, they're not tan thrilled either.
Think about them, huh?
Don't you think at least we should do
a gig before we shunt a music video?
- You want a gig? Mm.
- Yeah.
Watch this. Brat.
- Bourbon.
- Oh, Dennis. Paul Gill.
Paul, you gut a lat of nerve calling me.
Okay, okay, okay.
I was a douche. I get it. But listen close.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I'm listening.
<i>I need The Bourbon tonight.</i>
<i>I will pack the place.</i>
I will get the whale town
to came out for it.
Who's playing?
Stacee Jaxx.
His first solo gig. And I've got a new act
that you are gonna love.
And this time,
every cent goes to the house.
- Every cent.
- Every last penny...
...brother,
of which there will be millions!
Dc we trust him?
Yes.
Okay, deal.
You're one lucky sun of a gun.
See you tonight.
- Louise, call the PR department.
- Paul, I need--
Shush. I'm rolling here.
Call the PR department and tell them I
need to buy all the advertising blacks...
...on every drive-time radio station
this afternoon.
Stacee's Rolling Stone cover.
It hit the newsstands an hour ago.
Haw bad is it?
Stacee Jaxx.
On the phone?
Oh, my Gad.
H ey.
Hey Man.
Man.
Stace. Seriously--Oh!
Can you please ask Hey Man
to just chill for a second or two, man?
Yes, I'm an that. Don't worry about it.
I just tore the editors a new one.
You should've heard me, man. Ho, ho, ho.
- Shit!
- Page 58, second paragraph.
- Read.
- Okay.
Okay.
Ah...
Uh...
"Stacee Jaxx will tell you
he's a cowboy...
...but lately he seems more like a...
...'bay-cow' who's gotten last
in the herd.
But the biggest danger is the man
who seems to be calling the shots...
...his manager Paul Gill,
a man so oily...
Exxon might want to reconsider
buying stock in him."
Okay, well, you know,
that could also mean that I'm real slick.
Because I am. There's no such thing
as bad publicity.
Okay. That was funny.
"Even the legendary Bourbon Roam
isn't sacred.
This reporter learned that Stacee Jaxx
and Paul Gill...
...walked away with virtually
all of the night's proceeds."
Whoa.
That part.
Is that true?
It's not not true.
It's more more true...
than I would perhaps prefer.
Okay, yes, I'll be clearer about that.
Na more bullshit. Na more bullshit.
I wish that the true part were falser.
You know what, man?
Let's start all aver again.
Let's turn that frown
the right way around.
What do you say, sad clown?
I gut something for you. One-of-a-kind.
Ha-ha.
One hundred and fifty years old.
Priceless.
Lack, so what if same...
...hack journalist
took some potshots at you'?
All your life,
you have wanted to be number one.
You still are number one.
Let's toast to that.
And I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get that reporter fired...
so please don't dump that on my head.
I would never do that.
Mm.
150-year-old Scotch.
It's priceless.
Mm-hm.
You're fired, Paul.
Hey Man.
It just goes to show
that sin doesn't sell anymore.
And if Dennis Dupree
can't pay by midnight, well...
Then it looks like Los Angeles
will be able to reclaim the real estate.
D rew?
Sherrie. What are you doing here?
Sorry. I didn't realize
you owned the place.
Wait, wait, wait.
Haw are you?
I'm great. Quitting The Bourbon was
the best thing that could've happened.
Yeah.
Me tan.
What are you wearing?
Oh, uh... This is kind of my new lack...
...far the band I'm in.
The Z-G uyeezz.
- Yeah, I've heard of them.
- Na.
Nat them.
The Z-G uyeezz.
Double the E, double the Z,
double the flavor.
And we're playing The Bourbon tonight.
Huh.
Haw about you? You singing?
Na...
...I'm dancing.
Aerobics. I teach aerobics.
Ever see Stacee again?
- What do you mean?
- After your big fling.
- Wait, you think he and I--?
- I dun'! think.
I saw you.
- What did you see?
- The night I played.
You were walking out of his dressing roam,
he was zipping up his pants.
You think I slept with Stacee Jaxx?
You didn't?
I was in lave with you.
Drew...
L.A. really isn't working out for me.
It's time to go home.
- Sherrie...
- What?
Sherrie, can we please just start aver?
- Pretend nothing-
- I'm a stripper at the Venus Club.
I'm in a bay band.
You win.
Na, wait.
Here.
This is something Wayne,
Ziff and I recorded last week.
That sang I was writing.
The one about us.
Please...
...listen to it.
Sure.
We both lie silently still
In the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together
We feel miles apart inside
<i>Was it something I said</i>
<i>Or something I did?</i>
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Though I tried
- But I guess that's why they say
- But I guess that's why they say
<i>- Every rose has its thorn</i>
<i>- Every rose has its thorn</i>
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>
Yeah, it does
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you
The wound heals
But the scar
That scar remains
Yes, it does
I know I could have saved our love
That night
If I'd known what to say
<i>Instead of making love</i>
We both made our separate ways
And now I hear you've found
Somebody new
And that I never meant
That much to you
To hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
Oh, every
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>
on, oh
SHERRIE, JUSTICE E DREW:
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy
Sings his sad, sad song
Yeah
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>
Oh, yeah
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>
Sherrie? What's wrung, honey?
I'm fine, I'm just a little...
...ruined.
I never should've come to L.A.
You ain't ruined, baby.
But you will be if you stay here.
It's not fame and fortune
you came lacking far, Sherrie.
It's lave.
And lave left this place a long time ago.
Sherrie?
Someone dropped this off for you.
"Sometimes things that are last
can be found again.
Don't stop believing. Lave, Drew."
Rolling Stone. Also, we're closed.
Put Cinderella on the phone.
Are you talking about the fake person
with the stepmother?
She stuck her tongue in my ear.
She blew my world up.
Are you messing with me right now?
Is it someone that is trying to really
freak me cut? Because it's working.
This goddess...
...she put a mirror up to Stacee Jaxx.
You're talking about Constance...
...not Cinderella, which--
I guess they sound similar.
Constance Sack.
Constance?
Put her an.
She's not here. She's at The Bourbon...
...in Los Angeles, and she's covering
Stacee Jaxx's first solo gig.
Sc you can go there and weird her cut.
I have a gig?
Are you Stacee Jaxx?
Hello ?
Great. That's not gonna make me feel
like I'm gonna get killed tonight.
People!
We must obey petty bureaucracy.
It's what separates us from the beasts.
As you can see,
this club is totally out of central.
But, Mitch, this ends tonight.
It's time we wiped the filth ofi the streets
of this great city.
The people of Los Angeles
are not gonna take it anymore.
<i>- Powerful words from Patricia Whitmore</i>
<i>- You! Mrs. Mayor!</i>
Why are you so uptight?
You lot need to feel the wind of change
Blow the cobwebs out of your gussets.
We built this city an rack 'n' roll.
- Right?
- Yeah, we did!
We built this city
My grandfather's father
built this city!
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
Built this city
Haw dare you!
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
Who counts the money
Underneath the bar?
Who rides the wrecking ball
Into our guitars?
Don't tell us you need us
'Cause we're the ship of fools
Lookin ' for America
Crawlin ' through your schools
We're not gonna take it
We built this city
No, we ain't gonna take it
We built this city
We're not gonna take it anymore
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
- We're not gonna take it
- We built this city
- No, we ain't gonna take it
- We built this city
We're not gonna take it anymore
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
We built this city on rock 'n' roll
Stacee Jaxx has just arrived...
...for his first solo show!
It seems history is no doubt about to be
made again at The Bourbon Room tonight!
Hey!
Na! Na, nu!
Where is the police
when you need them?
Hey, you! Hey, policeman!
You can't let him in there!
Here, hold this.
Stacee, excited about the show?
Thank you.
Are you listening to me?
What are you doing?
He can't go in there!
Oh, Gad!
You stay away from me.
Patty.
Your tits have held up well.
Oh. my Gad!
Mitch, this is breaking news.
I have in my hand an album.
It's Arsenal 1977 Live at The Bourbon.
Great album, incidentally.
If I could just draw your attention
to the inside sleeve.
This photograph here of a nymph...
...apparently about to gargle
Stacee Jaxx's body porridge...
...is none other than Patricia Whitmore,
the mayor's wife!
<i>- Ooh!</i>
<i>- This is our Watergate!</i>
Rock lives on!
You saw it here live.
The mayor's wife appears to be an
ex-groupie of none other than Stacee Jaxx!
Sweet baby Jesus.
Stop! You cut that!
Oh, my Gad! Stacee!
Yeah.
I'm sorry about the article.
Open your mouth.
Uh, uh, uh...
Ladies and gentlemen...
...you foul and pestilent congregation
of vapors...
...we're gonna have a fantastic
evening tonight!
Later, performing an this stage,
we'll see Stacee Jaxx!
But before that...
...we will have the less important...
...but somehow worthwhile...
...making their debut here an
The Bourbon stage, the...
"Z-G uyeezz."
Give it a whirl, I suppose.
Rack 'n' roll!
Sc may I introduce to you...
...the guys you've known
for all these days:
The Z-G uyeezz.
- Danny-Z.
- Kevy-Z.
Me, Joey-Z.
And Jashy-Z.
You
Me
One day we can have a baby
Is that Drew?
I'm afraid it is, yes.
Oh, my Gad, I just threw up.
Where?
In my pants.
Out of my ass.
Hey, they're lip-synching!
Baby girl, I wanna still be
- Who is this?
- The Z-Guyeezz.
Great, right?
Where is Stacee?
Really sick.
Hush
Hush
Baby, we've been talking too much
I just wanna stare at your...
Shh
Put my hands around it
Squeeze, touch
Thank you.
Don't rush
Hey! Ha, ha, ha!
What the hell are you doing?
Sherrie, I'm so sorry.
- Drew, stop! Shh.
- I should have trusted you.
It's okay. It's okay.
You can't go home.
Your new band sucks.
And, yeah, this? This has gotta go.
Heh. Whoa.
<i>You got L-O-V</i>
<i>Baby, I could be the E</i>
Hey, Jashy-Z, if all these people
want refunds, my club is closed.
On, oh
on, oh
Wait.
Just wait right here.
Hi.
I want my money back!
Oh, Hey Man.
Oh, my Gad.
"I awe you this.
Your rack brother, Stacee."
Gad! That Stacee Jaxx.
He gives until it hurts.
Whoa.
That's right, get him off!
Hey!
You little shit.
You just destroyed your one shot.
I didn't destroy anything, Paul.
I tank a stand.
Really? For what?
Rack 'n' roll, baby.
Oh, rack is aver, pal.
Rack is dead!
Ha-ha-ha. That's right, Hey Man,
rack will never die.
All right! Well, now that that's over...
...are you guys ready to rack?
This is a very special sang,
written by a very special person.
<i>Just a small-town girl</i>
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train
Gain' anywhere
Just a city boy
<i>Born and raised in South Detroit</i>
He took the midnight train
Gain' anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine
And cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
- Strangers waitin'
- Strangers waitin'
- Up and down the boulevard
- Up and down the boulevard
- Their shadows searching in the night
- Their shadows searching in the night
- Streetlights, people
- Streetlights, people
- Livin' just to find emotion
- Livin' just to find emotion
<i>- H:'d:'n'somewhere in the night</i>
<i>- H:'d:'n'somewhere in the night</i>
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
<i>Pay:'n' anything to roll the dice</i>
Just one more time
Some will win
Some will lose
<i>- Some were born to sing the blues</i>
<i>- Some were born to sing the blues</i>
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Hey, put your hands together, Les Angeles,
for the man who wrote this sang...
