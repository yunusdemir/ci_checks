<i>Station announcement.</i>
<i>The train standing at platform two...</i>
<i>... is the 4:50 for Ealing Broadway,</i>
<i>Hanwell, Hayes, West Drayton...</i>
<i>... Langley, Taplow, Milchester,</i>
<i>and Brackhampton.</i>
- Tickets please.
- A woman has been strangled. I saw it.
- I beg your pardon?
- A man strangled a woman in a train.
I saw it. Out there.
- Strangled?
- Yes, strangled.
You must do something
about it at once.
Me? Well...
Madam, don't you think perhaps you had
a little nap and maybe had a bad dream?
Young man, I was not dreaming.
I saw it.
What are you going to do about it?
Well, look, we'll be in Brackhampton
in about five minutes.
- I'll report it as soon as we get there.
- Thank you.
- Could I have your name and address...?
- Yes, of course. Miss Jane Marple.
- Marple?
- Marple.
- Old Pasture Lane.
- Pasture Lane.
- Milchester.
- Milchester.
Very well, Miss Marple.
I'll report this to the station master...
- Yes, please do.
- Thank you.
A bad dream indeed.
All right, Lucy. I'll answer that.
- Good morning, madam. I'm...
- Not today, thank you.
Inspector Craddock, County CID, madam.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Do come in, inspector.
I've just been going through
all the papers again...
...for the last two days,
and still not a word about the murder.
I suppose the police asked the press
to say nothing for the moment.
Do sit down, won't you?
Lull the murderer into a false
sense of security, then pounce, eh?
What's that?
Oh, how stupid of me.
- Here.
- I'm so sorry.
Lucy. You will have some tea,
won't you?
Some tea for the inspector, dear, please.
Yes, ma'am.
Well, now, have you got him?
Well, I...
That is, we have come to the conclusion
that what you saw on the train was...
- Well, a man and a woman...
- Yes, as I said.
I mean, perhaps
they were honeymooners.
Inspector, I may be
what is termed a spinster...
...but I do know the difference
between horseplay and murder.
Of course, madam... Miss Marple.
But the fact remains that there's been
a search of every train...
...and no hospital treated any woman
as you describe.
She was blond and had on a coat
with a pale fur collar.
And no such woman has been seen
getting on or off a train...
...alone or with anybody else.
- Of course not. She was dead.
Further, a search has been
made of every inch of the tracks...
...for the whole length of the line.
Negative.
So you don't believe me?
- I didn't mean to imply that.
- You certainly did.
- Not at all. L...
- What then?
L... I assure you Miss Marple...
...that a woman cannot be murdered on
a train a few minutes before a station...
...without our finding out about it.
I'm quite sure you mean well,
inspector...
...but if you imagine
that I am going to sit back...
...and let everybody regard me
as a dotty old maid...
...you are very much mistaken.
Good day.
Sorry, Mrs. Stainton.
<i>The Hat Rack Hanging,</i>
Falcon Smith's latest...
...I'm afraid we haven't
received our copy yet.
Plain inefficiency.
I want to know
the moment it comes in.
Of course, of course, Mrs. Stainton.
- Oh, good morning, Miss Marple.
- Good morning, Mr. Stringer.
Good morning, Hilda.
One moment.
<i>The Hat Rack Hanging.</i>
I've been keeping it for you.
Mr. Stringer, would you say
I was an unstable woman?
Certainly not.
- In full possession of my faculties?
- Absolutely.
- Not given to hallucinations?
- Why, no.
Thank you, Mr. Stringer.
- The police think I'm dotty.
- What?
Apparently what I saw
was a young man and woman...
...in the throes of connubial bliss.
I see. Well, if I were you,
Miss Marple...
...I would certainly write
to the chief constable.
How many detective novels would you
say we have read over the years?
Impossible to say.
Certainly many hundreds.
Yes. Which gives us,
wouldn't you agree...
...a certain knowledge
of the criminal mind?
Most assuredly.
Well, this is where we put
that knowledge to the test.
- We?
- Yes, we.
So it has come in.
- Has it?
- Well, I think I have first call.
I don't think you'll like it, Hilda.
Too obvious.
The mother did it, of course.
How can you know that?
The book has just come in.
It always is with Falcon Smith.
A deprived child, you know.
Hot buttered crumpets for tea,
Mr. Stringer, if you care to join me.
Indeed I would, Miss Marple.
Yes, here we are.
Now I calculate
the 5:00 express to Brackhampton...
...overtook my train
somewhere about there.
But how can you be sure?
Well, I remember the ticket collector
saying, "Five minutes to Brackhampton."
It couldn't have been more than
a minute after the murder he came in.
So that makes it six minutes
before Brackhampton...
...at, say, 30 miles an hour.
So about there.
But the body, Miss Marple?
Well, it seems clear
that was thrown from the train...
...between here and Brackhampton.
- The police found nothing.
- Of course not.
The murderer returned before the search
and disposed of the body.
By Jove, the police will certainly
want to investigate now.
Well, according to them,
there is nothing to investigate.
Surely, in the light of our theory,
a fresh search...
Certainly. But this time
we will conduct our own.
Yes, Mr. Stringer.
I recommend
a hearty breakfast tomorrow.
You and I are going to take
an early morning walk.
There must be something somewhere.
You can't throw a body
out of a fast-moving train...
...without leaving some kind of trace.
Miss Marple,
if we linger here much longer...
...I feel certain we shall be apprehended.
Oh, nonsense. No one will give
a couple of tracklayers a second glance.
I'm not altogether convinced
our disguises are adequate.
A shoe, a bit of cloth, something.
I'll concede our timetable
may have been out of date...
...but I'm quite sure
the 7: 15 is still running.
- Very possibly.
- But it could be most dangerous up here.
Undoubtedly.
Miss Marple.
- Miss Marple.
- Yes?
There you are.
I think I heard something.
And I think I've found something.
Really?
Consistent with something having been
dumped from a train, wouldn't you say?
If it was the body, it would roll down
and finish up against this wall.
Then where is it?
That, Mr. Stringer, is the question.
It could be buried.
You'd need a pick or a shovel.
No, this is hardly an ideal spot
for disposing of a body.
Unless...
From her fur collar, I think.
Mr. Stringer,
will you kindly give me a leg up?
- Really, Miss Marple, l...
- Please, Mr. Stringer.
No, no.
Make a stirrup.
- Come on, careful. Are you ready?
- Yes.
- Interlock your fingers.
- They are interlocked.
- Well, are you ready?
- Yes.
Up.
Magnificent.
Down.
- What a frightful-looking man.
- What a frightful-looking dog.
Miss Marple,
prudence demands a retreat.
Mr. Stringer, I am convinced the body
is on the other side of this wall.
But that's the Ackenthorpe Hall Estate.
I know. Perfect.
Easy for someone to come down
out of the house...
...recover the body, and dispose of it
somewhere in the grounds.
Someone from the house?
You mean one of the family?
Yes. Or one of the servants,
if they're lucky enough to have any.
Servants. I wonder...
Miss Marple, whatever it is, no, no.
Mr. Stringer,
we will withdraw temporarily.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm afraid there's
nothing on my books.
Not so much as a mother's help.
I'm seeking a post, not offering one.
- Pray be seated, do, my good woman.
- Thank you.
You need seek no more.
You've come to the right place.
How good to see the spirit
of unselfish service is still with us.
Let me see now.
Yes. Here's a perfect plum.
"Cheerful home for cheerful lady.
Own suite, TV, radio and the use of car.
Tea in bed on Sundays.
Pension scheme."
Heaven forbid.
Oh, all right.
"Mrs. Forbes Alexbridge.
Setting up house near Monte Carlo."
They won't have any foreigners,
of course.
"Own gaming allowance."
Well, I don't approve of gambling.
"Mrs. Hamilton Potts."
The Dingley Stud Farm, you know.
"Seven children, eldest, 7."
Oh, no, thank you.
Perhaps if I might have a quiet word
with Mrs. Binster.
I am Mrs. Binster.
Oh, I see.
Well, as a matter of fact...
...I wondered if there might be a position
at Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Ackenthorpe Hall?
- Yes, Ackenthorpe Hall.
Oh, yes, I think I can accommodate you.
Yes, there's always a vacancy there.
Thank you.
Yes?
I'm Jane
from Mrs. Binster's Employment Agency.
The new maid.
Well, you look old enough
to know better. Come in.
I am to see Miss Ackenthorpe.
You're expected. In there.
- Miss Ackenthorpe?
- Yes?
I'm Jane.
- The new maid?
- Yes, Jane Marple.
Now, if you'll kindly show me
where I'm to put my things...
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
But I'm wondering if this post is really
what you're looking for, Miss Marple.
Well, naturally.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
I don't want a housekeeper, you know.
I want someone to...
Well, to do the work.
Yes. You want cooking, washing up,
beds made, floors scrubbed...
...fires lit, ashes taken away,
I quite understand.
- Well, I hope you'll find us suitable.
- I'm sure I shall.
Perhaps you won't find the work
too exacting.
There are only the three of us.
Myself, my nephew
down from school for the holidays...
...and then there's Father.
- May I show you to your room?
- Yes, certainly.
I'll take that, my dear.
Perhaps the clubs, if you wouldn't mind.
I must keep fit, you know.
Yes, of course.
Our staff consists of Hillman,
the gardener...
...and Mrs. Kidder, she let you in.
She comes in from the village
three afternoons a week...
...to do the rough work.
That was my grandfather.
He founded the family fortune.
- Tea biscuits, you know.
- Oh, yes.
And very excellent biscuits
they were too.
Quite a severe man, I'm afraid.
Miss Marple, I think it only fair
to explain to you...
...that my father himself is...
Well, quite frankly,
he's a bit difficult at times.
He's an invalid, you know.
He's very keen on economy...
...and he sometimes says things
that upset people.
I wouldn't want you to...
I'm quite used to looking
after elderly people of all sorts.
We'll manage.
Emma? Emma? I hear you?
Yes, Father. Excuse me one moment.
Don't try to sneak off.
Is that the new girl with you?
Well, yes, Father.
Hope she's got a bit more meat on her
than the last one.
Can't stand them skinny.
Don't just stand there boggling,
girl, bring her in.
- I want to look at her.
- Yes.
Will you come in, please?
Father, this is Miss Marple. Jane.
And a plainer Jane
I've never set eyes on.
Well, we can't all be young and
handsome, can we, Mr. Ackenthorpe?
There's one thing
I can't tolerate and that is impertinence.
Well, we should get on admirably.
Neither can I.
Well, if you're coming to stay here...
...there's one thing
you'd better understand.
Because I live in a big house...
...it doesn't necessarily follow
that I'm a rich man...
...so there's no good coming here
with extravagant ideas.
I live here because I want to,
not because I can afford it.
- Father, don't you think...?
- No, I don't.
- Can you cook?
- If you want good English cooking, yes.
Cod's as good as lobster any day,
and much cheaper.
That depends on whether or not one
has a palate unsullied by cheap opiates.
If you mean what I think you mean...
...this cheroot cost two shillings.
Yes, quite.
I'll show Miss Marple to her room.
This way, please.
Good idea.
That was Hillman, the gardener.
When Mr. Ackenthorpe wants
to move about, he always calls him.
They're quite close.
Will you be staying, Miss Marple... Jane?
Why, my dear lady, of course.
I'm so glad.
Emma. Come back here.
You've forgotten my medicine.
Excuse me a moment.
That's your room, down there.
- The door opposite the small stairs.
- I'll find it. Don't you worry.
- May I give you those?
- Of course.
- All right?
- Yes, thank you.
Come out at once.
I advise you to come out.
Very well.
You're Miss Emma's nephew, I presume.
Yes. Alexander Eastley. How do you do?
How do you do? I'm Jane, Jane Marple.
Yes. It is disappointing, isn't it?
I'd rather hoped
for the Jayne Mansfield type.
I see you have something in common
with your grandfather.
Oh, we're very alike in many ways.
Mind you, I'm not mean with money.
He'll stop that vase
out of your wages, you know.
It's just as well you got out
of the way, otherwise...
It'd have been my head,
and you'd have got 10 years.
That is still possible.
You know, it isn't just that
you don't look like Jayne Mansfield...
...you're not my idea of a maid, either.
Well, quite honestly, I don't think
you'd be everybody's idea of a boy.
You know, there's something
decidedly fishy about you.
I can see you'll have to go.
After Mrs. Kidder, of course.
She's next. Depressing creature.
So was Annie.
- Annie?
- Your predecessor.
Thin as a rake and a shocking cook.
Can you cook?
Well, I think I've done better
than Annie.
Grandfather's like that too,
and he hates his dinner to be late.
I'd leave your unpacking until later,
if I were you.
Well, in that case, hadn't you better
show me the way to the kitchen?
Very well, Jane.
- Emma.
- That's him.
Always shouting about something.
- Mostly money. This way.
- Emma.
Of course, they're all waiting for him
to drop dead, you know.
Frightful pack of vultures, our family.
Except possibly Aunt Emma.
And who are these vultures?
There's Uncle Harold,
stinking rich and just as mean.
Uncle Albert, deadly dull, poor fellow.
Then there's Uncle Cedric.
He paints, but not for art's sake.
Do you know, last year,
he and one of his models...
- Alexander!
- Well, he's like that.
- There was an Uncle Edmond.
- Was?
Yes. Stopped a whole bomb
during the war, all by himself.
Wasn't another man around for miles.
Deserting, probably.
And who can be held responsible
for you?
Well put. Mummy's name was Edith,
but she's dead.
Daddy's Brian Eastley, you know.
You know, the fighter ace.
Battle of Britain.
- Oh, the Brian Eastley.
- Yes.
I'm going to set him up in business when
I get my inheritance from Grandfather.
Here we are.
There you are, and about time too.
Well, I'm off.
I wouldn't stay in this place after dark.
Not for all the tea in China.
Now look, the pots and pans
are on that shelf there, over the stove.
- Oh, yes.
- The groceries and provisions, in there.
- Thank you.
- Well, cheerio.
- Good day.
- Good day, Mrs. Kidder.
- What's the matter with you?
- I was merely being polite.
Charming, isn't she, Jane?
- I think you should see this. Come on.
- What?
Phase four, anti-Kidder campaign.
Splendid.
Dinner at 8, please, Jane.
I see you made yourself comfortable.
I trust you have no objection.
Maybe.
I shouldn't make yourself
too comfortable if I was you.
Yes?
- Who are you?
- I'm the new maid, sir.
Doctor Quimper.
You'll get used to seeing me here.
- Alexander, I suppose?
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well, Mr. Ackenthorpe
will be expecting me.
Oh, yes. I'll show you up.
Oh, that won't be...
The doctor...
Where on earth
are my confounded matches?
Oh, it's you.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
What are you doing in here?
Snooping, I suppose.
Where are my matches?
If you're going to smoke,
we'd better have some windows open.
I'm a great believer in fresh air,
aren't you, doctor?
Why, yes, I am, Miss...?
Marple her name, marble her nature.
That's right.
Let her give me double pneumonia.
If you can't kill me off one way,
you'll kill me off another.
Nonsense. You're going to live to be
100 in spite of anything I can do.
In that case, tell that woman to stop
opening windows and light my cheroot.
Is there any chance
that will send him to sleep, doctor?
I'm afraid it's a stimulant.
Roll over.
Oh, dear.
Hold it closer, woman.
Your hometown lost a good horse doctor
when you left, Quimper.
As a matter of fact,
I was very bad with the horses.
How'd the birthday party go?
All the family get down all right?
Of course they did.
Made a whole weekend of it.
- Board and lodging from Friday night.
- Friday.
- What's that to do with you?
- Oh, nothing.
It just happened to be
an interesting day for me too.
How old were you, Mr. Ackenthorpe?
Mind your business.
Anyhow, it was a miserable weekend.
I hope it'll be a long time...
...before I have to put up
with them again.
Not a very nice way
to talk about one's family.
Not a very nice family.
And you know what
that overgrown beatnik Cedric, did?
Told Emma, in front of me,
she ought to get out of here.
Get married or something.
Tried to make her as selfish as he is.
I don't know. If Emma did marry,
it wouldn't be such a bad thing.
Father, I thought I'd tell you
I'm going into town.
I'll be leaving in a moment.
Can I give you a lift?
What do you want to go to town for?
Can't she go for whatever it is?
Well, it's tradesmen, Father.
A few bills to pay.
Money. All right, it's a different thing.
Can't trust anybody these days.
All right, off you go.
- In that case, may I be of service?
- Thank you.
Of course you can, Quimper.
Save the price of a taxi.
- Pay you enough as it is.
- It'll be on your bill.
- You ready now?
- Only my coat.
Good. Friday, then, Mr. Ackenthorpe.
Good day, Miss Marple.
Good day, doctor.
If you don't shut those windows,
you'll be fired.
In that case, I shall require
four weeks wages in lieu of notice.
- Get out of my sight, woman!
- With pleasure.
Your weight
isn't quite evenly distributed.
I'll have you know that I won
the Ladies Open Handicap in 1921.
Really?
- I'm sure you have many things to do.
- Not at all. I'm most interested.
We've never had
a golf-playing maid before.
You may have heard that this is the age
of the common woman.
- You hooked.
- I'm aware of it.
- You know something?
- What?
I believe you pulled those shots
on purpose.
Alexander, if you wish
to be helpful at all...
...will you kindly look for the hook
while I look for the slice?
Found yours yet?
Yes, have you?
Disappeared without a trace.
Well, fortunately I have some more.
At the present rate,
you're going to need them.
Perhaps you would care
to demonstrate the next one.
Certainly.
Let's see how close you can get
to those outbuildings.
Yes, I think that's possible.
Fair.
You know perfectly well it was superb
for a boy of my age.
Right on the fairway.
A chip and a putt
and I'd have holed out in three.
Does your grandfather keep horses,
Alexander?
He did. Now he just keeps a few relics
of a more spacious age.
Nostalgia, you know.
A failing of the old, I suppose.
Like to look?
Well, I think I'm old enough don't you?
An old-fashioned Pony chaise.
They used that for going to the village.
I suppose they used the Victoria
for going to church?
Yes, on Sundays in the summer,
I believe.
And the brougham's for visiting
in the winter perhaps.
Yes, I expect so.
It's supposed to be haunted here,
you know.
Grandfather found a man
hanging from this rafter.
- Good heavens.
- He'd been dead a week.
- That will do.
- All purple.
Alexander.
- What was that?
- I wonder.
All right. I'll look.
All yours.
Dear, dear, we are nervous, aren't we?
Pity.
- Well, what did you expect to find?
- Bodies.
- What?
- Live ones, of course.
Used to be quite the spot
for courting couples from the town...
...till grandfather got Hillman to stop it.
Spoil sport. Quite extraordinary,
the goings-on here.
- Apparently there was this girl...
- That's enough, Alexander.
There may be some other
poor bird trapped.
Look at this.
Somebody else must have been in here.
- This isn't Aunt Emma's.
- It's mine.
I must have dropped it.
Thank you so much.
It was bequeathed to me.
You're not, by any chance, on the run
from the police, are you?
Too much television.
You must learn to rationalize
your imagination.
What's behind there?
More relics from the past?
Matter of fact, yes.
The fruits of grandfather's
Egyptian phase.
Indeed.
How interesting.
- No one's allowed in there.
- Let go of my wrist.
- What are you up to?
- Up to?
- The boy was showing me around.
- What boy?
- Alexander. He...
- You're lying.
Alexander, come out of there at once.
I thought discretion
the better part of valor, Jane.
This fellow's not above clipping
a person's ear.
You know your grandfather don't like
no one sneaking around here.
Don't think I won't tell him, neither.
Despite the double negatives,
I'm sure you will.
Come, Jane.
Good for you, young man.
What?
No.
No.
Now, listen, Mr. Stringer...
...I want you to inform the police,
anonymously.
Don't mention me yet.
I wish to be in at the kill, so to speak.
Miss Marple, really.
All right, but it makes my blood run cold
to think of you there alone.
I was wondering, perhaps they have
a vacancy for a gardener?
They've got one.
Very well, I'll do as you say.
Miss Marple, the compact.
If the murderer should know
that you have it...
I'll be careful, dear Mr. Stringer.
Now phone the inspector right away.
- Well?
- Never seen her before in my life.
No, she's not from these parts.
Well, whoever she is,
I want her out of here at once.
If you hadn't left the barn unlocked
this wouldn't have happened.
We wouldn't have these people
poking their noses into everything.
- Are you all right, Father?
- Of course I'm all right.
Think I've never seen a corpse before?
Be one myself soon.
Perhaps you'd better
go back to the house.
I'll follow you up.
Whoever it was tried
to get her in here first.
It must've taken the strength
of a maniac to shift it this far.
Inspector?
Oh, yes, doctor.
I don't know whether
this is being helpful...
Go on.
Well, the woman, no one recognized her.
And her clothes struck me as
being foreign. Perhaps French.
Yes, that's very interesting.
Yes, thank you, doctor.
Well, it was just a thought.
Maybe a useful one. Thank you.
That would explain why
I didn't recognize her, sir.
I know every face for miles around.
I'm sure you do, sergeant.
Still, I have to start
with the assumption...
...there's some connection
between her and the family.
I think I'll get the whole bunch
down here.
There'll be fireworks, sir.
They hate the sight of each other.
So I believe.
Anyway, routine first.
Have they any other servants
apart from this gardener?
Yes, they have, inspector.
Good Lord.
- You.
- Yes.
Dotty old me.
In there, please.
It's only a cigarette packet.
Of doubtful significance, I'd say.
I'll bear your views in mind.
Any idea what you expect
your fellows to find?
- Clues.
- Well, naturally.
But do you seriously think
they'll find anything?
Well, somebody dragged the body
from there over to there.
It's possible something could have been
dropped in the process.
- Don't you agree?
- Yes. Yes, I do.
- Did you find anything?
- No, inspector. Not a thing.
- Family's here, by the way.
- Thank you.
I'll get around to them later.
They'll enjoy that, I'm sure.
Good hunting.
Some silly idiot goes
and strangles his girlfriend...
...which she probably richly deserved,
and what do they do?
Swarm all over the place...
...mess about in our private affairs.
I said to this inspector fellow,
Haddock, or whatever his name is...
Craddock, sir.
- Shall I pour?
- Of course.
Anyway, I said to this fellow, Haddock...
...that no member of my family had ever
seen the woman, and that was final.
Well, what makes you
so sure of that, Father?
Now, Cedric, this is absurd.
Well, after all, Harold,
she wasn't from around here...
...and she was found in our stable,
wasn't she?
One of us could have known her.
She could've been your girlfriend,
dear boy.
What?
Yes, yes, I suppose
Cedric has a point there.
- He never has a point.
- I mean, from the police point of view.
It's all right for you, Eastley.
I don't suppose you're too concerned
with the family reputation.
After all, you're not a member of it,
are you, strictly speaking?
What I can't understand
is who telephoned the police.
Oh, I know who did that.
Who?
Obviously someone who knew
the body was there.
Any coffee left, Jane?
Help yourself.
Well, it certainly wasn't one of us.
- Who knows?
- Who cares who did it anyway?
- The woman was probably a spy.
- That's absurd, Father.
The police think she was a foreigner.
Well, lots of English girls go to Paris
and buy French clothes.
Decent ones don't.
Doctor Quimper to see you,
Mr. Ackenthorpe.
Still getting shot
with revitalizers, Father?
I'd take anything to outlive you lot...
...and keep my property from
your thieving hands.
Well, I'll just go and see if I can be
of any further assistance to the police.
Delicious coffee, Jane.
By the way, the inspector said
he'd be interrogating you all later.
Better get your alibis ready.
He's a bright boy, that one.
Well, let's face it, the police say
the woman was murdered on Friday...
...and we were down here last Friday.
They're gonna be very interested
in all of us.
But none of us were here till quite late.
Yes, but the point is,
what were we all doing earlier?
Albert, what about you?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
Don't tell me you were
in your office all day.
L... Well, no.
As a matter of fact, there was a film
that I particularly wanted to see.
A Brigitte Bardot?
Now, look, Cedric, this is preposterous.
Oh, well, is it, Harold?
Very well, what about you?
Or can your secretary verify
all your movements on that day?
- That's none of your business.
- Well, I'm in the clear.
I was at my club.
It has a back door, hasn't it?
Yes, I think so, but I didn't get
here until Saturday.
But you could've lugged
the body up here on Friday...
...slipped back to London...
...and be sitting in your usual chair
when the club closed.
I suppose one of your women friends
can vouch for you?
Why, I'm certain my current comfort
will satisfy the inspector completely...
...as, no doubt, will your secretary.
When you've finished here, will you
kindly bring me some fresh coffee...
...into the library?
Certainly, sir.
Well, well, jumpy, isn't he?
And you're very calm.
But then, I've no reason not to be.
I've just been thinking.
If that woman was foreign...
You should think of girls
more often, Albert.
Might bring about
some changes in you.
- I know it's laughable.
- I agree.
No, but, I mean, if she was French...
It could be her, I suppose.
All right, I give up. Could be who?
That Martine woman.
- Martine?
- Yes.
You know that French farm girl
we had all the trouble about?
The one Edmond was so infatuated with
before he was killed?
- But that was ages ago.
- Yes, I know.
Still, I suppose it is possible.
But why should she turn up dead
in our stable 16 years later?
- It's preposterous.
- Well, it isn't my idea.
Well, whose idea is it then?
Well, Emma's.
Emma?
Emma's?
That's odd.
Paul.
- Darling.
- No, Paul, please.
How much longer are we
going on like this, Emma?
We've got to tell the old man.
- Not yet. Please, not yet.
- Why? Why?
Paul...
...I think someone in the family
may be a murderer.
Emma.
I've had a letter.
I can't keep it to myself any longer.
I want you to read it.
I'm afraid my French isn't up to this.
"Dear Miss Ackenthorpe...
...you will be surprised to hear,
after so many years...
...that you have a sister-in-law.
I married your brother Edmond
two days before he was killed in action.
I decided it was best
to forget the marriage...
...but now I'm planning
a visit to England...
...and I find I do wish to meet you all.
I write to you instead of your father
because I understand he is a sick man...
...and my existence may come as a
shock to him, as it must be to you all.
Sincerely yours, Martine Ackenthorpe."
But I thought Edmond was killed
before they had a chance to marry.
That's what we all thought.
- What's on your mind, Emma?
- Well, don't you see?
The strangled woman,
it must have been Martine.
Listen, if she could've proved
she was really Edmond's widow...
...she'd have been entitled
to share in the will.
Oh, I see.
Paul, what shall I do?
- Have you told the others?
- No.
I did suggest to Albert that if the woman
was French, she might be Martine.
What did he say?
He said it was fantastic,
but I think he was worried.
You'll have to tell the police.
They're bound to think
one of the family did this.
What else can you do?
I don't know. I don't know.
I think you must tell them.
I'll have to think about this.
You'd better go.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- Oh, there you are.
- The train was late, Miss Marple. L...
Good evening, inspector.
I suppose you knew about
this compact business?
- Well, l...
- Before I did, no doubt?
Well, you see...
I thought it best to bring the inspector
in on this after all, Mr. Stringer.
- Very wise. Very wise.
- I'm glad you think so.
Withholding information from
the police is a serious matter.
Oh, I know, inspector,
and I'm most awfully sorry.
- Will you take tea?
- Thank you, no.
Don't you realize what this means?
The compact having been stolen
from your room?
Coffee perhaps?
It means that the thief and the murderer
are almost certainly the same...
...and that he or she is in that house...
...and that your life may be
in great danger.
Oh, I say, do you really think so?
Now, I must ask you to give the whole
thing up immediately, tonight.
Yes, of course.
Indeed you must, Miss Marple.
Very well, then, I'll give in
my notice tomorrow.
Good.
That's settled then.
It has to be a month's notice, you know.
- Will you have a small beer, inspector?
- Miss Marple, I...
Oh, what's the use?
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, now, how did you get
on at the Probate Registry?
Really, Miss Marple, I think,
in view of what the inspector said...
- Did you see the will?
- Yes.
And what did it say?
Well, old Mr. Ackenthorpe's father
obviously didn't get on well with him.
I'm not surprised at that. Go on.
You see, the house and the income
from the family fortune are his...
...but he can't touch the fortune itself.
That's the first point.
Yes?
The second point is that the fortune
goes to his children on his death.
- To Emma, Cedric, Harold and Albert.
- Yes.
Two of the others in the will,
Edith and Edmond...
...are already dead, of course.
That much more for the rest.
Well, young Alexander,
Edith's son, gets her share.
What about the boy's father, Eastley?
Next of kin only come in for a share
if there's no issue of a marriage.
So Eastley's only interest is
how much young Alexander gets?
- Dr. Quimper to see you, sir.
- Oh, yes, send him in.
Your call to the Probate Registry's
been very useful.
Thanks.
- Morning, inspector.
- Morning, doctor, sit down.
Thank you.
Have you found out
who the woman is yet?
The French police haven't come up
with anything so far, sir.
You are working on the assumption
that she's French, then?
The clothes and makeup did turn out
to be made in Paris, yes.
Is that what you wanted
to see me about?
No, sir.
I understand last Christmas...
...old Mr. Ackenthorpe
had a stomach upset.
Yes, he's inclined to overindulge
when there's too much rich food about.
But he said you had asked him
a lot of questions...
...as though you suspected
arsenic poisoning.
All right.
I did suspect
something was a bit odd.
- Didn't you run a food test?
- No.
Why not?
Well, there was nothing positive.
No history of chronic gastric trouble...
...such as one would expect to find in
the classic method of arsenic poisoning.
You mean small doses
administered regularly?
Exactly.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Put her on.
- Miss Ackenthorpe.
- Emma?
Yes.
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hello. Morning.
<i>I've had a letter from...</i>
I see.
Well, would you read the letter to me?
<i>"You will be surprised to hear,</i>
<i>after so many years...</i>
<i>... that you have...</i>
<i>I am planning a visit to England,</i>
<i>and I find I'm"...</i>
Thank you.
I'd like to send round for that letter
if you don't mind, Miss Ackenthorpe.
Yes, we'll check with the French police.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Do you know what
that was about, doctor?
Yes, I think I do.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm in love with Emma, inspector.
I want to marry her.
I told her I thought
she ought to tell you about this.
- But you didn't insist?
- No.
It was important to me, to us,
that she made up her own mind.
- I understand, doctor.
- Thank you. Is that all?
Doctor, do you think the dead woman
is Martine Ackenthorpe?
Well, who else could it be?
Do you think she was killed by
a member of the family?
I'd rather not answer that, inspector.
All right, doctor.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.
Well, sir?
I'm worried, Bacon.
- About the doctor?
- No, no, not him.
I'm worried about Miss Marple.
Looking for something, Miss Marple?
No, I...
Are you...? Are you all right?
Yes, perfectly, thank you, Mr. Eastley.
What is it you want?
Well, I just thought I'd take up
the old boy's nightcap...
...and save you the trouble.
That's kind of you. It is ready.
The storm, I expect.
The electricity supply's rather shaky.
Like the rest of the place.
- You're a little shaky too, aren't you?
- No, not at all.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Oh, my goodness, what are you doing?
Looking for light.
- You ought to be asleep.
- I happen to be reading.
May I ask what you're doing?
Trying to provide light.
Oh, I see. Well, you won't
find it there, you know.
- Indeed?
- It's a power failure. Often happens.
- May I borrow this?
- Alexander, come back.
Good night, Jane.
Who's that? Who is it?
Mr. Cedric, it's a power failure.
Often happens.
I'll have to find some candles,
if you'll excuse me.
Just a minute.
My sister says you started work here
only a few days ago.
Yes.
You don't look like a domestic to me.
I have to earn my living,
Mr. Ackenthorpe, like anybody else.
The day after you arrived,
the body was discovered.
- You found it, didn't you?
- What makes you think that?
Because it fits, and so neatly.
You telephoned the police, didn't you?
I assure you, I am not the person
who telephoned the police.
- You're not?
- No.
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?
I have already told you.
Well, I'm going to watch you
very closely, Miss Marple.
Jane.
Oh, Hillman, I want
to have a word with you.
Help.
Help.
What's the matter? What is it?
Albert, see to Albert.
Alexander, call the doctor, quickly.
There was nothing I could do for him,
I'm afraid, inspector.
How are the others now?
Well, Emma, Cedric, Harold
and Eastley...
...have had only comparatively
minor effects.
And the old man will be all right.
He's a tough old bird.
He'll be recovered by morning.
- No doubt about the cause?
- No.
They were all poisoned.
Well, thank you, doctor.
Quimper! Quimper!
Harold. I might have expected him
to bellow the hardest.
- This is the last. Chicken stock.
- Thank you.
- Finished, sergeant?
- Just about, sir.
See that stuff gets
down to the lab right away.
We're pretty well all through for tonight.
Well, Miss Marple?
Mushroom soup, curried duck,
rice and apple pie.
Thank you.
- Mushroom soup out of a can?
- Certainly not.
Half a pound of mushrooms,
chicken stock, milk, flour, butter...
...lemon juice, touch of herbs.
- Mushrooms?
- I had some of the soup myself. Superb.
I'm sure. The pie?
I'm afraid I never can resist
my own pie, inspector.
Anybody else's, of course...
- The curry?
- Exactly.
Good, of course.
But rice, you see... Fattening.
And as I was having the pie...
Where did the duck come from?
Oh, those. Mr. Harold shot them.
He seems to be rather fond
of killing things.
The boy, Alexander, he doesn't seem
to have had any curry either?
No. I thought it would appeal to him.
Curious child.
Well, did anyone come into the kitchen
while the cooking was going on?
Not while I was there.
I do have other duties, you know.
Anyone could've come in then.
Six people are poisoned...
...only one dies.
I'm thinking about that too, inspector.
Excuse me, sir, message
from the chief constable.
- He's waiting up to hear your report.
- All right.
- In person, sir.
- Right, sergeant, get the car.
- I'll be out in a minute.
- Very good.
I think the two killings
are connected, don't you?
Yes, I do.
Now, we've got to find out who
has that compact, Miss Marple.
So far I've only been able
to search one room.
- Whose?
- Unfortunately, Albert's.
- Miss Marple, I have to go now, but...
- Oh, yes, I know.
A policeman's work is never done.
Nor a woman's.
I was going to say, please be careful.
If you do think of anything, I hope you'll
take me into your confidence.
The lab boys turned it up
as arsenic in the curry.
Not a lot, just enough for
stomach aches all the way around.
- Not enough to kill.
- So Albert must have had an extra dose.
Yes, but why poison the others at all?
If the poisoner is a member of
the family, he had to be ill as well.
Well, say it isn't, sir.
I mean, that gardener
of theirs, Hillman...
...there's talk in the local pub that
he's in for a nice bequest...
...when old Ackenthorpe goes.
Well, it is a possibility, sir.
You're forgetting
the dead woman, Bacon.
This poisoning makes it pretty certain
she was Martine Ackenthorpe.
French police come up
with something then?
Only that there's
no record of a marriage.
The village where Edmond was stationed
was blown to bits during the war.
- All the files in the town hall, destroyed.
- Well, sir?
Well, don't you see, Bacon?
It's the pattern of the killings.
Only a member of the family would
want to get rid of her too.
Yes, kill off your relations in easy stages,
except the old man.
When he dies a natural death...
...inherit the entire fortune
as well as the property.
Albert must have got his
second dose after dinner.
Possibly in a drink.
I shouldn't drink that.
- Why not?
- Because it's lunch time.
- What is it?
- Beef broth, baked custard.
Beef broth? But I ordered beef steak.
The doctor said beef broth.
To the blazes with him.
I give the orders in this house.
I'm sick of slops. Take it away.
Certainly.
Hillman, another bottle.
Surely you realize that
if the woman was Martine...
...by showing that letter to the police,
you've pointed the finger at one of us.
Not only for her death, but Albert's too.
- Exactly. One of us.
- I might have expected that from you.
Come now, you're thinking along
exactly the same lines as I am.
If you didn't do it, that is.
You're probably thinking it was me.
Stop it. Stop it.
Or even you, dear Emma.
Look, I think we've had just about
enough of this nonsense.
I bet the police don't think it's nonsense.
Now listen, Cedric...
...say what you like about the rest of us,
but leave Emma out of it.
Well, it could be argued, you know...
...that Emma kept that letter until
she could use it to her own advantage.
What?
I think you'd better explain that.
Well, let's face it. The moment
Martine's body was discovered...
...everyone in this family
was under suspicion...
...including you, Emma.
And the moment you produced
the letter voluntarily...
...everyone was under suspicion...
...excluding you.
- I hadn't thought of it like that.
- You must be round the bend.
That woman was strangled.
Do you think your sister capable
of a thing like that?
Oh, but Emma's an attractive woman,
don't you think so?
Well?
Well, an attractive woman doesn't need
to do her own dirty work, does she?
Emma, I think we better
leave them to it.
Now, now, Eastley...
...Emma has her eye
on the good doctor, you know.
It's not going to be easy for you to
marry into the family for a second time.
That hit home, didn't it?
Yes, and I'm about ready
to break your blasted neck.
Very possibly.
But tell me something first:
Do you deny meeting Emma
secretly in the grounds...
...the night before
the body was discovered?
- Well, I...
- Hillman saw you, you know.
All right, we did meet that night, yes.
He asked me to intercede with Father.
- What for?
- To borrow money, if you must know.
Oh, my goodness.
What are you doing?
Making up the bed.
But you made it up this morning.
Yes, but the pillow slips
need changing.
They look perfectly all right to me.
But not to me. What am I doing?
I do wish that woman would hurry up.
They know I don't like being
here after dark.
What are you afeard of?
Some man will get you?
You know, it's funny how
things always come together.
My sister's eldest had measles...
...and then her Ernie fell
and broke his arm...
...and her husband come
out all over with boils.
All in the same week.
You wouldn't believe it, would you?
It's gonna be the same thing here.
First that nasty murder...
...and then Mr. Albert poisoned.
Who's gonna be the next,
I'd like to know?
Things always go in threes.
Here you are, Mrs. Kidder.
I'm sorry to have kept you...
...but the doctor has been
with Mr. Ackenthorpe.
Long wait for very little.
The younger generation.
Well, I don't know.
What's the matter with you?
It's Mr. Harold.
Did he use this on himself,
or did somebody else pull the trigger?
Well, it'll add up if it was suicide.
Harold killed the other two,
got cold feet...
...and took what is laughingly
called the easy way out.
All of them knew he liked shooting
before dinner when he was at the Hall.
But he was shot from a range
of two inches.
All right, someone he knows
comes up to him...
...casually asks to have a look
at the gun and...
Still could've been suicide, though.
If I were the murderer, that's exactly
what I'd want us to think.
One thing's sure, we can't risk
any more killings. Come on.
- Where to, sir?
- The Hall.
I'm gonna find that compact...
...if I have to turn the whole place
and everyone in it upside down.
Excuse me, sir.
There's a lady to see you, sir.
A Miss Marple.
Oh, come in.
Good afternoon, Miss Marple.
- You were going somewhere?
- Yes.
Then I'll come to the point at once.
A beautiful little piece, isn't it?
- Who had it?
- Young Alexander.
- What?
- I should have realized, of course.
That boy's incorrigible.
Playing it in the middle
of the night like that. Typical.
- So we're back where we started?
- Oh, no, inspector.
I think I know who our murderer is.
The difficulty's going to be
getting him to show his hand.
- Sit down, Miss Marple.
- Thank you.
Oh, hold that expression, Emma.
Oh, pity, you spoiled it.
What's the matter, darling?
Things not working out for you?
How do you manage to make everything
you say sound like an insinuation?
- He works at it.
- For heaven's sake stop fussing.
If I wish to come down,
I shall do so.
I think this chair, Hillman.
- Father, don't you think...?
- Now, don't you start.
Sorry, but you know what he's like
when his mind is made up.
I'm not gonna stay up there all alone.
Might get murdered in me bed.
At least there's some safety in numbers.
- I quite agree with you, Father.
- Well, that makes a nice change.
I want a drink.
No, not you. Quimper.
Then I must be going.
Don't smother me with it, man,
put it round me knees.
Well, this is all very nice and cozy.
How about a rubber of bridge?
It was just a thought.
What have you got there, boy?
Oh, a charming little thing.
French, Second Empire.
Pretty valuable, I'd say.
- Where'd you get it?
- It belongs to Miss Marple.
Really? You better give it
back to her, haven't you?
I only borrowed it.
I'll drop it in on my way to bed.
Come in, doctor.
You're expecting me?
Didn't Alexander tell you?
Tell me what?
Forgetful boy.
I have a sore throat, doctor...
...and I asked him to ask you to be kind
enough to have a look before you left.
I see.
I'm sorry to trouble you. I haven't
had one of these throats in years.
Well, you've been lucky, Miss Marple.
Any headaches?
No, just a sore throat.
Well, we'll have a look.
- This is rather attractive.
- Yes, isn't it?
- Where did you get it?
- I found it.
- Where?
- In the stables here.
Really?
Open wide, please.
Say "aah."
No inflammation.
Don't you think that was
a little dishonest?
Keeping the compact, I mean?
Under the circumstances, doctor, no.
- Is there any swelling?
- I don't think so.
I've seen you like that
once before, doctor...
...your hands at a woman's throat.
It was on a train,
and you were strangling her.
That's quite an allegation.
I have a few more.
You've come for the compact because
you had given it to that woman...
...and it might be traced back to you.
- I think she was your wife.
- Do you?
You killed her after you had written
that letter to Emma...
...signing it Martine Ackenthorpe.
Why should I do that?
The murder, so that you would
then be free to marry Emma...
...the letter, so that people would think
the dead woman was Martine...
...and look among the family
for the killer...
...never at you.
How did you arrive at
this fascinating hypothesis?
It was I who found her body.
Martine was, or is, for all I know,
a Normandy peasant.
The dead woman had never
worked on a farm in her life.
I saw her hands.
- Go on.
- Certainly.
You then proceeded to
augment your prospects...
...by eliminating Albert and Harold.
How, conceivably?
You contrived to introduce
arsenic into my curry...
...which I find unforgivable,
by the way...
...knowing that you would be called on
to deal with the aftereffects.
Easy then to give Albert
his final dose in the medicine.
And Harold?
You shot him
and made it look like suicide.
Ingenious, I must admit.
More than that.
Now that you are here to secure
your dead wife's compact...
...a fair case.
Yes.
A pity you won't be able
to present it.
One more murder, doctor,
might be one too many.
This won't look like murder,
Miss Marple.
The death certificate,
signed by me, of course...
...will register heart failure.
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.
You're under arrest,
and I must warn you...
That everything I've said has been taken
down and will be used in evidence.
You were right about
everything, of course.
You're a very brave woman,
Miss Marple.
Good night.
About time too.
I was coming up to see you,
you know, before leaving.
No need to leave.
- I have my own home, Mr. Ackenthorpe.
- Sell it.
Why on earth should I?
Well, taking one thing and another...
I mean, you're a fair cook...
...and you seem to have
your wits about you...
...and, well, I've decided to marry you.
- Well?
- Well, I'm honored, of course.
Of course you are,
but come to the point.
I'm afraid that cannot be.
Why?
Well, if ever I do embark
on such a venture...
...there is someone else.
Nonsense.
I don't believe it.
Who on earth would have you?
Apparently you, for one,
Mr. Ackenthorpe.
Goodbye.
The woman must be
completely unbalanced.
- Oh, Miss Marple, I am so glad.
- How good of you to come.
- Let me give you a hand.
- Thank you.
