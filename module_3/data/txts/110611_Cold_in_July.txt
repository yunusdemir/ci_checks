How you feeling, son?
Peachy,
aside from almost shitting myself.
Yeah, it must have been
a scary thing for a man like you.
A civilian, I mean.
His name was Freddy Russel.
You know him?
(PRICE) I know shit when I step in it.
I'll need you to come to the station
and make a formal statement, okay?
Okay.
Now what?
Now it'll go to the grand jury.
They'll look over everyone's statement,
and they'll "no bill" you.
- What about the courts?
- It'll never get that far.
It was self-defence.
- He was unarmed.
- You didn't know that.
It's called "fear of life".
Legally, he might as well have been
pointing a gun at you.
Look, he's a wanted felon,
and you're an upstanding citizen
without a record.
Sometimes the good guy wins.
We're gonna have
to keep that a while, okay?
It belonged to my dad.
He was a good man.
He'd have been proud.
Of what? My finger slipped.
You OK?
Uh-uh.
Come on, bud.
Let's go back to bed.

Jordan, son, stop jiggling.
No, you can't take that

Fine.

Man, that air conditioner feels good.
I hear you got you one last night.
Mack at the paper told me.
I couldn't believe it was you at first.
I didn't think you had it in you.
- Easy. It's not something I'm proud of.
- Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Someone breaks into my house, he'll
have to pick his teeth out of his ass.

No, he just waved.

- What do you want me to do here?
- I want him arrested.
For what? He hasn't done anything.
- He threatened my son.
- Said your boy looks like you.
- He showed up at the school.
- In broad daylight,
in front of witnesses,
and did nothing.
He wants my son, I know it.
I want protection.
That's not gonna happen,
not without a legal reason.
(SCOFFS)
I'll tell you what I'll do, Rich.
Unofficially, I'll have a car

Give you a little peace of mind.
He's just trying to scare you.
Don't let him.

Richard.

I don't like that word,

You and Jordan should stay

I don't wanna put her in danger too.
What about your dad's cabin?
No. It's too isolated.
- It's the last place I wanna be.
- I want a "idghalada".
Son, don't talk when others are talking.
It's not polite. Eat your dinner.
I say we stay home. Take Jordan

Now, all you got to do is be normal.
Go to work, take Jordan to school.
Be seen.

Just in case you missed it.
This is six weeks ago.
Buried on the back page,

So he turned state evidence, then.
And your boy found himself
on the ass end of a federal case.
Now, we know Freddy ain't no saint,
but if he's messing around
with these boys in the Dixie Mafia,
they some bad dudes.
How far do you wanna take this, Ben?

If he's alive, I wanna see him.
All right.
Well, I got some hunches on it.
I wanna feel them out first.
But first thing, we gotta relocate.

I got this gal I used to run with.
She works in the office at FBI.
It seems Freddy is assigned
to the Witness Relocation Programme.
- You know what that is?
- They give people a new start.
New name, new place.
Mob informers and shit.
Yeah, you got the picture, framer.
They're the ones that set you up.
For the last couple of years, your son's
been running with the Dixie boys.
Doing whatever Mafia-types do.
And the shit gets
way over Freddy's head
and the law comes down on him hard.
So to keep
from going to the slammer,
he starts to sing like a little bird
against his old buddies, the Dixie boys.
Now, you don't wanna fuck
with the Dixie Mafia.
And the feds know that,
so they make Freddy a deal.
They'll hide him,
if he gives them what they need.
- So they faked it?
- It was beautiful.
If the Dixie Mafia believes
that Freddy is dead,
well, (LAUGHS) what's the use
in gunning for a dead guy, right?
Good plan, don't you think?

<i>(mom Ben'?</i>
Ben? Hey.
Open the door.
Open the door, Ben.
Put the gun down.
Would you put the gun down, Ben?
(RICH) We could go to the cops
And show them the tape.
It wouldn't do any good.
They know what their boy's doing.
He is protected.
But he's killing women.
Prostitutes,
cross the border illegally,
and nobody cares.
How long you known him?
We were in Korea together.
He saved my life.
He never said he was in the service.
(JIM BOB CHUCKLES)
I don't know
whether you've noticed it or not,
but old Ben ain't much
on small talk, is he?
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
Stubborn as a mule, though.
Get some rest, boy.
All right.
(LIGHTER FLICKS)
(GUNSHOT)
What the fuck?
(GUN CLICKS)
(GUNSHOTS)
I got cows in that pasture.
What are you gonna do
when a dog goes bad on you?
Bites somebody or hurts somebody.
There's only two things
you can do, right?
You either chain him up
or put him down.
But which do you think
is more cruel, huh?
You're talking about killing
your own son? That's crazy.
Well, I can't very well
chain him up, can I?
I need a drink.
I haven't even had
my goddamn coffee yet.
Son of a bitch.
(SINGING IN SPANISH)
- Thank you, darling.
- (WAITRESS )You got it, baby.
Have you given any thought
as to how you're gonna do this thing?
Well, it ain't rocket science.
What about the big Mex?
If he's there, we'll shoot him too.
Oh, good.
Well, I'm glad you got a plan.
I was worried
that you were just gonna wing it.
You got a better idea?
Not yet. I'm working on it.
(BEN) Just remember, he's my son,
and I'm pulling the trigger.
(BAND CONTINUES SINGING)
(PIGS SQUEALING)
Good luck.

- Hey.
(ANN CHUCKLES)
- Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- (ANN) Honey, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
(RICH) That's OK. That's OK.
(ANN) Sorry. OK. Ice cream?
(JORDAN) No. Potato sauce.
(ANN) No? Potato sauce?
(COMMENTATOR SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY OVER TV)
(ANN) I'm glad the trip went well.
I hope you get the contract.
- What?
- (ANN) I said, I'm glad the trip went well.

Framer's back.
(CAR ENGINE STARTS)
(TRUCK ENGINE STARTS)
(JIM BOB LAUGHING)
Well, how about that?
The video store is a cover.
The boy has got more brains
than you do, Ben.
Must take after his mama.
Okay, framer, go in there
and look for exit doors and side rooms,
things like that.
You just act normal, all right?
What about the Mexican?
(JIM BOB) Just be quick about it.
(DOOR BELL RINGING)
- Hi.
- Hey.
Is there something
I can help you with, sir?
Yeah. Uh...
You have a foreign film section?
We don't carry nothing foreign
but Jap and Mex stuff.
That's right,
just Japanese and Mexican fare.
- And some British too.
- We got Limey stuff?
(HORN HONKING)
I'd prefer you not use offensive terms
- if you're gonna work for me.
- (GEORGE) I didn't mean nothing by it.
- Sorry, you know...
- It's all right.
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?
(TRUCK HORN HONKING)
Uh...
Yeah. What time y'all close?
11 pm. Sharp.
(TRUCK HORN
CONTINUES HONKING)
(HONKING)
Shit.
- Chicken?
- No, they're out of chicken. Only beef.
Oh, actually, hey, you know,
I just got this new release in from...
What--?
(DOOR CLOSES THEN BELL RINGS)
- You all right?
- Yeah.
They close at 11.
(JIM BOB) Ben.
<i>Esme, meeme.</i>
Here. Just in case.
All right, that's them.
- Let's make this quick.
- Just tell us when.
Oh, shit, shit, shit.
Fuck, they got company.
I don't like this.
(WOMAN CHUCKLES)
- Let's take them all out.
- There's six of them, Ben.
We don't know
how many more on the inside.
- Fuck them.
- (COCKS GUN)
Ben.
We're gonna do this the right way.
Are you feeling me, Ben?
Take the gun out of my ear, Jim.
I'm feeling you.
(RICH) Wait. Look.
(MAN) All right, see you there.
- What do we do?
- Follow them.
(ENGINE STARTS)
(JIM BOB) This must be where they do it.
A lot of cowboys down there, Ben.
You wanna rethink your math?
Fuck the math.
(JIM BOB) Looks like there's
gonna be one left outside.
That means five on the inside,
plus the girl.
Count to ten, then one of you step out
and get his attention. I'll do the rest.
Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six...
You're actually counting?
He said to count to ten.
Oh, shit.
Hey. Tiny.
