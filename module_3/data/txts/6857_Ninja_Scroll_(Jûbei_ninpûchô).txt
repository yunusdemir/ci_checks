Thanks to your interference,
we lost 300 pieces of gold.
l just can't go back empty-handed.
lf your hands are empty, will you hold this?
ls it true they hired you for 20 pieces of gold?
Yes.
The sword we stole is a precious treasure
given by the Shogun.
They'll only pay you 20 pieces of gold
for getting it back for them?
Ridiculous.
They're a poor, small clan.
You can't swindle 300 pieces for a sword.
You're asking too much.
Shut up! Damn you!
lt seems we'll have a storm.
l can't waste my time here.
NlNJA SCROLL
Oh, l'm sorry.
lt was a terrible storm.
lt sure was.
The roof was blown off and my wife went
into labour out of shock. We were in a fix.
ls that your seventh child?
No, the ninth.
You love your wife very much.
lsn't that Sakichi's daughter
from Shimoda Village?
What's the matter?
Hey! What's wrong?
All dead.
Everybody's dead.
All dead?
Epidemic.
Because of an epidemic disease.
Terrible!
Off limits! You can't pass here!
The highway will be closed
until the epidemic disease is gone.
Epidemic? No, thank you!
What is it?
Sir, my man saw a strange group of men
run away toward Shimoda Village
late last night.
lt might have something to do
with the epidemic disease.
So l came to tell you, Chamberlain.
What do you mean? Did they spread poison
as they passed through the village?
Ridiculous! Why did they have to do that?
Something's odd. l can smell it.
Leave it alone.
On second thought, we can't.
These are your orders, Koga Ninja Team.
Go to Shimoda Village
and find out what really happened.
Yes.
However, if anyone in your clan
gets infected by the disease...
We understand, sir.
One group will go along the Shirakawa River,
the other will go over Taro Pass from the west.
You'll reach Shimoda Village
in about an hour. Understood?
The group of suspects Hikoza saw was eight.
They're no match for us.
Our enemy is the epidemic disease.
That's right.
Kagero.
Hanza, why count me out of this mission?
You have your own mission, don't you?
Poison tasting is very important.
Don't forget that.
While our lord is away from his domain,
that work isn't necessary.
ln the meantime, l belong to
your group of Koga ninja!
Still, l can't take you.
You might die on the mission.
How can l
just sit and wait here alone?
Kagero has become even more beautiful.
That's why l pity her even more.
lt's her destiny. She must hate it.
Say no more.
Where are Hikoza and the others?
They were right behind us. l'll take a look.
Hey! What are you doing?
What?
There!
Damn it!
Kagero, go back and report to the Chamberlain!
Get out of here quickly!
Be quiet and you'll live longer.
l wouldn't mind laying a dead girl.
lt'd be a nice change.
That's better.
l'm busy. Beat it.
Can't you hear me?
Actually, the highway was blocked
and l made a detour. l'm afraid l'm lost.
Can you tell me how to get to Kakio?
How terrible.
l told you to beat it, remember?
Forget it.
l'll get rid of the pest then l'll kill you slowly.
What now?
You regret not running away, don't you?
No. l've been thinking about your body.
Your body can't be hard as rock everywhere.
Hurry!
Tessai.
You lost this time. No point in chasing them.
l'll kill him!
l forbid it. Don't forget our mission.
Take my word as Lord Gemma's order.
Understood?
We're leaving.
Who was that guy?
Forget it. l don't want to see him again.
l'm grateful to you.
l belong to the Koga Team. Name's Kagero.
Mine is Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.
Are you all right?
Don't worry about me.
The town of Kakio is in the west.
Let's split up.
Who is it?
Kagero of the Koga Team, sir.
What's the matter?
The twenty ninja led by Hanza tried
to infiltrate Shimoda Village a while ago
but they were annihilated.
ls it true? All of them? Who killed them?
Someone very strong and skilful.
That's all l can tell.
They were useless, after all.
-So you're the only survivor?
-Yes.
We can't send our men to the village
of the epidemic disease
without knowing who he is and what he's up to.
Go back and find out.
That's the first thing to do.
We'll think of what to do later. Go.
No.
l know the way, so leave me alone.
No, you've got the wrong direction.
The River of Hades is
this way!
That hurts!
That makes us even, doesn't it?
Let's call it quits.
Not yet. You still owe me.
That's not wise.
First of all, if we keep on doing this,
one of us will die.
One of us?
There's no reason we should kill each other.
We'd better stop now.
Shut up!
That's a unique technique of yours.
But it won't hurt my body.
Looks like it.
What's the matter, monster?
Something's wrong with your skin.
Die!
Splendid!
Your sword moved as fast as the wind
and killed your enemy instantly.
He was no match for you.
Why don't you join me?
Your skills will be of great help
for me to fight the likes of him.
Stop joking.
Who wants to fight monsters like him again?
You'll have to. They won't leave you alone.
You already killed
one of the Eight Devils of the Kimon.
You didn't beat him by yourself, though.
That woman ninja of the Koga Team
uses an interesting technique.
Lord Gemma. Everything's on schedule.
It'II come from the Shogun of the Dark
by six o'clock tomorrow evening.
Very well.
Write to him in return.
"We'll be back in three days.
There's nothing to worry about."
lmmediately.
lsn't Tessai back yet?
Benisato went to look for him.
Right now it's just the two of us alone.
Yurimaru, l've been in love with you.
Don't push your luck, Zakuro.
l'm not interested in you.
Go and stand watch.
So it is true.
You'd be happier in Gemma's arms.
However, Yurimaru, Gemma makes love
to both men and women.
Did you know he makes love to Benisato?
You didn't, huh?
And which way are you heading, my lone warrior?
No particular place. And you?
l'm looking for somebody.
And you look exactly like him. So...
Strangers can look alike.
l'm a vagabond named Kibagami Jubei.
lt was your face exactly.
Tessai copied your visage in a mask.
You're the culprit.
Don't bother me any more.
That's her cast-off skin.
She shed it off like a snake and got away.
Well, well. They're truly a bunch of freaks.
You don't owe me any gratitude.
l didn't want you to die right now, that's all.
Who are the Eight Devils of Kimon?
A group of ninja
who work for the Shogun of the Dark.
He wants to rebuild the House of Toyotomi.
He already roped in sixteen lords
and is trying to expand his influence.
He is the most dangerous enemy
to the Tokugawa government.
His power is supported in the shadows
by those Eight Devils of Kimon.
What are they doing here
in the Mochizuki region?
That's what l am trying to find out.
lt's a tough job.
Why don't you work for me
for 1 00 pieces of gold?
A Tokugawa government spy wants to hire a ninja?
There's no way l can go home happy,
considering what happened.
My party was attacked and killed
by the Eight Devils.
Only l survived to reach Mochizuki.
l need your help by all means.
You can't get away from them, either.
You'll have to fight them sooner or later.
Join me. lt's a nice offer, isn't it?
l don't think so.
You should stop counting on me.
l see. lt's too bad.
lt's a pity.
You're losing your precious life.
-You're getting annoying.
-l mean it. Listen, this is very important.
To tell you the truth,
some special poison was on this star.
lt won't kill you instantly,
but it will start to take full effect in a day.
When it does, nothing can stop it.
That is, unless you apply an antidote,
which l have.
lf you work for me, l'll give you the antidote
along with 1 00 pieces of gold
when the job is done.
You're bluffing.
lt's the truth.
Tell me now.
Give me the antidote immediately.
Not until you work for me.
lf you kill me, you'll die too.
Now you need to apply the antidote.
Poor boy! You have a lot to learn.
That isn't the dart that stabbed you.
l threw away the one that stabbed you.
Damn it!
You lost, Kibagami Jubei.
You're still wet behind the ears.
My name is Dakuan. Let's be friends.
Benisato.
You mean this man, Kibagami Jubei,
is the last of the government's spies?
Possibly.
Why didn't you kill him?
Somebody interfered.
No excuses.
lf he's the government's spy,
he'll show up soon.
Be sure to kill him next time.
l don't need orders from you,
since l already intend to do that.
Yurimaru, l'll tell Gemma about this
while we're in bed.
Do you mind?
No, l don't.
Jubei.
There's something l've been thinking about.
Are you, by any chance, the ninja who killed
the chief retainers of the Yamashiro clan
five years ago?
He had a sword technique quite similar to yours.
The retainers who were beheaded
were taking gold from a secret mine,
which they were protecting
for a rebellious lord.
lf the government found out about the
hidden mine, the lord would lose his fief.
But does that ninja know
that the government received
no report of the mine, even after the killing?
Why is it, first of all,
that if you government spies know all that,
you don't do anything?
No. Even the government can't make
a move without definite evidence.
Our spies tried to sneak in the clan
many times to find evidence
but no one returned alive.
The Shogun of the Dark stopped them
using the ninja group, Kimon.
Why does the Shogun of the Dark
help the Yamashiro clan?
lt's simple.
He wants to swindle the gold mine.
Do you know how the Shogun of the Dark
found the gold mine before the government?
Somebody gave him the information.
This somebody was the leader
of the ninja team of the Yamashiro clan.
Himuro Gemma?
Precisely.
lt can't be true. He's already dead.
No. He's still alive. And you'll see him soon.
Because he's the boss of the Kimon monsters.
-What?
-Hush! Not so loud.
I won't falI for the same trick twice.
Don't be too hasty to judge.
You'll soon find out.
It seems that you and the Ieader of the
ninja group are destined to meet.
Stop! We're friends. Why kill each other?
The Iord's order!
Our Ieader said so.
It's his trick!
He wants to get rid of us
by making us kilI each other
because we know the secrets.
He has created a trap for us.
Shinkuro! Believe me!
Jubei, forgive me.
Shinkuro!
His word is the Iaw.
l avenged Shinkuro and others myself.
Gemma can't be alive.
lt won't be long. There's that strange,
bloody humidity in the air.
lt is hell beyond this point.
Heaven must have sent this mist to help us.
Hey!
Damn mist!
Who is he to dodge me, Shijima,
and my demon's claw?
Who is it?
l heard a voice chanting the sutra.
l was praying for the dead villagers.
Don't you know
an epidemic disease is plaguing this village?
Poor soul!
You can no longer leave this village alive.
Now, come to the land of Buddha with me.
Have you seen a travelling monk here?
He'll go to Buddha's land very soon.
l'll send him there.
What a benevolent nun!
Shit! Another cast-off skin.
He vanished.
He uses a strange technique.
No, you're the strange one.
Answer my question.
Are there any other friends of yours
travelling with the monk?
Of course. More than 1 0 or 20.
Even these snakes aren't enough,
if you send a snake for each.
What a liar!
All right. l'll tell you the truth.
There are two. One is the travelling monk.
And the other is right behind you.
Get rid of the snakes. All of them.
You'll soon die.
Get rid of them!
Now it's your turn to answer.
What are you doing in this village? Talk!
You failed twice. lt's unforgivable.
l wound another line on your neck that time,
but you didn't notice.
You're just a stupid amateur.
ldiot! l was trying to suck the poison out!
Poison doesn't work on me. l'm immune to it.
l think l've repaid my debt.
Yes, thanks for helping me.
Kagero, right? What are you going to do?
None of your business.
lf that's so, then why was l brought here?
l must discover their plan.
By yourself? lmpossible!
They're too strong. Think about it!
Don't meddle in my business.
There's no reason to take orders from you.
Wait a minute, ninja woman of Koga.
My name is Dakuan.
Why don't you join me?
This man is also part of my cause.
l have no intention of helping a government spy.
Stop your blabbering.
What do you say? Will you help us?
The three of us have the same enemy
in common, although our aims are different.
Three is mightier than one.
And l have some information that you don't,
such as who commands them.
l'll tell you on the way.
l don't need any friends.
But l need your information.
Hmm. All right.
Well, what an attractive, sexy woman!
What's on your mind this time?
Well, that ninja girl is very useful.
She has a technique to poison the man
she sleeps with.
The man you killed was also poisoned by her.
Anyone who makes love to her dies.
She's perfect for this hellish world.
Your skill is as marvellous as ever.
No. He even killed a tough ninja like Tessai.
Don't let your guard down.
lt's possible he got away.
l want the four of you to find out.
You're cautious, Yurimaru.
We have an important mission.
We should take every precaution.
l know, l know. Don't worry.
Then go.
Yurimaru, Benisato was killed.
lt was good for you.
Only the fish are dead.
Good, that keeps things interesting.
Quite interesting.
How is it?
Just as l thought.
They poisoned the wells
and killed the villagers.
And they said it was an epidemic disease.
lt was a trick to keep the villagers away.
They're planning something extraordinary.
l'd like to know what it is.
That's fine. But don't get too involved.
lt'll kill you.
l see. Go escort them.
Get away!
We can't get away from them.
Kagero!
So the pollen is mixed with an anaesthetic.
But how long will it hold them back?
Huh?
Ninja girl! Hold them back till Jubei kills him.
Don't give up!
Hurry up and get rid of the wasps.
l'm afraid you must beat me first.
You don't know anything, do you?
Do you think l escaped into this watermill?
No, l don't. l have many questions
to ask you, but l have no time.
No, just one thing.
Tell me, is Himuro Gemma alive?
So what? Why do you ask?
Because l sent him to hell before.
ls that so? Then l must be careful.
Unlike Gemma, l don't have the technique
to reincarnate myself.
Reincarnation?
Stupid! You damaged the wasp hive.
When you surface for air, you'll die.
He's mine. Keep your hands off him.
The ninja girl and the monk?
lt's about time my wasps sent them to hell.
Where is he running to?
He's got no discipline.
He's fallen victim to the "throat needle."
Well, the wasps in the hive
are trying to escape the water.
So they desperately sting his body.
Mushizo is defeated.
He took his time, but he killed him at last.
Reincarnation?
Gemma? Himuro Gemma came back to Iife?
This is no joke!
Reincarnation? l heard about that technique.
You need to control your flesh and blood,
and every tiny piece of your bones.
lf your limbs, or even your head, are cut off,
you can put them back together again.
Reincarnation is a technique of immortality
that can never be achieved by a human being.
Terrible. And so it is.
Anyway, the Kimon monsters are now
all after you.
That means l can move easily.
lf you're lucky, we'll meet again.
Shit!
Why did you join him?
He hired me for 1 00 pieces of gold.
You do anything for money? A ninja for hire?
Sure. But he got me this time.
He trapped me.
l'll die of his poison in half a day.
He also promised me an antidote
besides the gold pieces.
That's why l work for him.
l can't back out now.
So you'd better go away
while l divert their attention.
l can't do that. l'd owe you another debt.
Forget it. No debt.
l told you. l don't take orders from you.
And l'm ready to die at any moment.
Relax. Don't pretend you're tough.
What?
Oh, damn it! lt's this hot, humid air.
l wish a storm would come
so the rain could cool your head.
You're not in a position to worry about me.
A storm...
It was that terrible, stormy night
when they came here.
Hey, is there a spot where l can
observe this whole area?
How about there?
Nothing here.
Keep searching.
Hanza!
Hey!
Hanza!
There's a cliff in front of you.
Stop!
Too bad.
-l got you!
-Damn it!
Stupid! They got you so soon?
We still have a lot to do.
Oh, the scent of flying, charred flesh.
What a great fragrance.
Don't move.
That's enough. Let go of me.
lt was my fault for falling into their trap.
Shut up! Don't speak.
Let go of me! l don't want your help.
Silence!
Grab it. Come on!
Are you just going to hang there?
l'm Utsutsu Mujuro.
l've been waiting to challenge you.
He's my guest. You stay here.
You lured me here because l'm blind?
ls that your plan?
lf you want to kill me, don't make a sound.
That's impossible.
But there's a way to take advantage of it.
l told you to stay put.
Your weakness is that you can see.
Get out of the way!
lmpossible!
Enough! What are you trying to do?
Why are you so upset?
Shut up! You're the one who's desperate
to save my life in return for favours.
And you risk your life so easily!
ls it because of your body?
ls it true that you poison and kill men
when you sleep with them?
Sleep with me, and you'll see.
Stupid!
Poison is steeped everywhere in my body.
lt's so strong even a touch on my lips
can kill you instantly.
No one can touch me.
lf you get close, you die.
Has the poison affected your heart, too?
How dare you!
l hate those who think little
of their own lives.
What do you know? You'll never know.
That's their game - the cargo on the ship that
drifted ashore in the storm two days ago.
They slaughtered the villagers mercilessly
for the cargo.
Where does this road lead?
Chamberlain!
Chamberlain,
is it true that the Koga Team of ninja
who went to Shimoda Village
for investigation were annihilated?
Exactly.
What happened?
This is a very serious problem.
-l'll take my men to the village immediately.
-No!
lf this is serious enough to jeopardize
the safety of our clan,
we should proceed very cautiously.
That's how small clans like ours can survive.
But...
A ninja woman who survived
is continuing investigation.
We wait for her report.
You're tired because you've been tense
for so long. Rest some more.
That path leads to Kashima Harbour.
They're going to take the cargo by boat.
l can't let them do it. The dead villagers
and Koga ninja can't rest in peace.
l'll cooperate with you
until the mission is done.
But if you disrespect me again,
l won't hesitate to kill you.
l command you, those who have been
serving the Shogun of the Dark.
This mission is very important.
lt can seal our fate.
This ship will reach the Mochizuki domain
in a few hours.
We must obtain the cargo by all means.
Understand? Try your best.
The townsmen feared the epidemic and ran away.
One horse is enough to scare them away.
So you're safe and sound. l've been worried.
lt's nice to see you alive, too.
They're waiting for a boat
to transport the cargo.
Did you check what the cargo is?
No. l couldn't reach it.
But l think l can guess.
l guessed before l came here to Mochizuki.
-What?
-Don't you understand?
lt's something related to your past.
Yes, gold.
Gold produced from that secret mine
of the Yamashiro clan.
The ship drifted ashore in the storm.
lt was probably heading
for the Shogun of the Dark
with caskets of gold yielded from
the secret mine and stored for five years.
lf they reach the Shogun of the Dark,
he'll be powerful enough
to topple the government
and we will plunge into another civil war.
So we must stop it.
-Dakuan, you've been followed.
-What?
Woman, what are you doing?
l'm calling a ninja bird of the Koga Team
in this village.
Calling a bird? What for?
lt'll carry my message to the Chamberlain.
l've discovered what they're after.
ln two hours, his army will surround the town.
Not very easily, l presume.
The Mochizuki clan
will possibly pretend ignorance.
Why?
The future of the clan is at stake.
A small clan like them will be smashed
if they get involved
in a fight for power between the government
and the Shogun of the Dark.
See nothing, hear nothing.
That's the best way for the clan.
We'll soon see if the Mochizuki clan
will make a move.
What are you doing now?
The man you hired will die of poison,
unless you give him an antidote.
Tell me how to save him.
You amaze me.
Have you fallen in love with him?
Damn fool!
He did me a favour, so l'll return it. That's all.
l don't think so.
What is going on when a ninja woman
falls in love?
lf you kill me, he'll die, too.
Yes. And your mission won't be fulfilled.
Damn it.
This is not good.
Don't be upset. l told you the truth.
That's his antidote.
There's no other way if you want to
save his life.
The rest is up to you.
lt happened quickly when l looked away
for just a brief moment.
WE HAVE KlDNAPPED THE NlNJA GlRL.
She's probably dead by now.
Now, let's get to work.
We can't count on the Mochizuki clan.
There's no reason to become their pawns.
Wait.
What if the ship arrives while you're gone?
Leave her alone.
lt's just a ninja woman lost. Who cares?
A trifle before a great mission?
You're as terrible as they are!
Damn fool! When you fight a devil,
be a devil yourself or you can't win.
ldiot! Go get poisoned and die!
Are you all right?
Kagero!
You're a diehard. But...
Woman, relieve him of his misery.
Kibagami Jubei?
Yes. But we already killed them all.
ldiot! They're still alive.
l'll kill him, for sure.
Stay where you are.
Lure them there and kill them.
-Understood?
-Yes.
l never expected him here.
l'm looking forward to seeing you, Jubei!
Gemma?
l'm sorry.
Never mind. Haven't the retainers
in the castle taken any action yet?
lt's been two hours.
ls that so?
You knew it was a trap,
but you came to help me. Why?
You're stupid.
Why risk your life for me?
Because you're my comrade.
Comrade?
Yes. We've helped each other many times
since yesterday.
You're my precious friend.
Don't come.
The Mochizuki clan already backed out.
Your mission is done.
lt's not done yet. l'm still in debt to you.
You can pay it back later.
Not if you're dead. l'll do it here now.
What are you going to do?
That man told me how to counteract the poison.
"Kill poison with poison."
He said if you make love to me,
you'll be cleared of poison.
Now, take me.
Why not? You'll die, unless you take me.
Why not? Jubei!
We've been waiting.
Load the ship immediately!
lt's you!
l told you, didn't l? We have no chance.
There are so many! We can't beat them.
l won't let them get away with the gold.
We'll take every chance.
What are you going to do?
When they finish loading the caskets
on the ship, go to the tower and ring the bell.
While their attention is diverted,
l'll sneak onto the ship.
When the ship is out on the ocean,
l'll sink it myself, without the aid of a storm.
Very well.
By the way, did you make love to the ninja girl?
That's none of your concern. Go! Beat it!
Gemma, where are you?
When l die, l'll take you to hell with me.
Did they make a move? The Mochizuki clan?
Oh, ninja girl! You did a good job.
Hurry, or they'll get away.
Any other members?
Don't worry.
They've already surrounded this territory.
Then, please, move quickly.
Jubei!
Kagero!
Stop! lt's their trap!
ldiots! Sakaki Hyobu died two days ago.
l killed him personally.
Gemma!
Sir, please get aboard the ship quick.
The retainers of the Shogun of the Dark
are waiting.
Leave Jubei to me.
l'll kill him upon my honour.
lt's my ardent wish. Please let me kill him.
Very well. Go.
Get out of my way.
Don't embarrass me any longer.
So you're Gemma?
lt's a secret from Mochizuki clan, isn't it?
Yes. Everything's all right.
You did a beautiful job.
l admire the Devils of Kimon.
The Shogun of the Dark must be glad.
Before you die, suffer long and deeply.
Yurimaru was unfortunate.
He was so careless he stepped in my trap.
lt was your own fault, Yurimaru.
Let's go.
Kagero!
Pull yourself together!
Jubei.
l told you not to come.
l wanted to apologise to you.
lt was the first time.
You treated me as an ordinary girl,
not as a ninja woman, a poison-taster.
l knew l was feeling attracted to you
more and more, and l was afraid.
So l tried to offend you. l'm sorry.
l don't care what you think of me.
Whether for the antidote, or out of compassion,
l wish you had made love to me then.
l was stupid. l was weak.
Why wasn't l more honest with myself?
That's enough. Don't talk.
Jubei, l'm glad l met you.
Gemma. The gold will soon help us
make our dream come true.
"Our dream?"
Our big dream.
We'll topple the Tokugawa government and
restore the reign of the House of Toyotomi.
You'll never understand how we
ex-Toyotomi retainers have suffered.
This time it'll be Tokugawa
who suffers the agony and torment.
We'll buy the most advanced weapons
from Spain, and beat Tokugawa.
That's the dream of our people,
who work for the Shogun of the Dark.
How frivolous.
What did you say?
lt's petty.
Watch your tongue! You're a mere ninja!
My dream is different.
The gold won't go to the Shogun of the Dark.
-What?
-We, Devils of Kimon, will take the gold.
Damn you!
l'll use the gold to organise
the most powerful army of ninja ever.
And we'll rule the country with terror
and power from within the shadows.
Anyone who disobeys me, Tokugawa or Toyotomi,
even the Shogun of the Dark, shall die.
That means the real Shogun of the Dark
will be me.
Well! l'm glad you came.
You're just the person l wanted to see.
l'm glad to hear that.
Of course.
Without your help,
l can't possibly sink a big ship
like this!
Damn old mule!
Over here.
What's going on?
The hold is burning!
We'll sink!
ldiot! Put out the fire!
lmpossible! lt's a sea of fire!
Extinguish it!
Hurry up!
We can't! lt's too late!
Gemma, my master!
Tell my men this.
Abandon ship and disappear.
l'll call for you one day. Go now.
Sir.
Gemma!
So you returned from hell with the hell hounds.
Kibagami Jubei.
l should've finished you with my own hands.
Stop complaining. lt's too late.
You want to avenge that ninja girl named Kagero?
She was trash in comparison with what l've lost.
l can't forgive you, of all people!
l won't kill you yet. Not before l torture you.
You'll have to pay for destroying my dream.
Your dream?
That you could be the true Shogun of the Dark?
That's a laugh.
lf you became a shogun,
there'd be nothing in this world but devils.
lf you want the company of devils,
hurry back to hell.
l'll kill you!
No one can kill me.
You know that very well.
You know l'm immortal.
ls that so?
lf you come back to life again,
l'll kill you again. No matter how many times!
Damn idiots!
Gemma! This is the last of you!
Jubei!
You seem to have gotten rid of the poison,
thanks to Kagero.
The combination of a talented ninja,
a poison-taster and a lone wolf,
worked well, much better than expected.
Get lost.
By the way, l feel sorry for Kagero.
How unfortunate!
One good thing was that,
if only for a short time,
she lived as an ordinary girl and found love.
Was that part of your plan, too?
Exactly. To read and control people's minds
is the secret of the ninja strategy.
Only real sincerity can move human hearts.
Heartless ninja like me can't do it.
You're great. l admire you.
You did a wonderful job.
As promised, l'll give you 1 00 pieces of gold
in Edo. Come and get it if you're alive.
That'll be your payment.
Never come near me again.
You got me.
l thought l would shut your mouth in Edo.
On second thought, you won't live that long.
You're going to die here.
Everything ends as l wrote it.
