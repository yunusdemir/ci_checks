The New World (2005)

Come, spirit.
Help us sing
the story of our land.
You are our mother;
We, your field
of corn.
We rise...
from out of the soul
of you.
Let him go.
You said
to hang him, sir.
Now remember, Smith,
you've come
to these shores in chains.
You're under a cloud
which will darken
considerably if I hear
any more of your
mutinous remarks.
Is that understood?
Captain Newport, sir,
I found oysters.
They're as thick as my hands.
They're the size of stones, sir,
and there's fish everywhere.
They're flapping against your legs.
- We're gonna live like kings.
- All these months at sea...
I'm weary
of looking further.
This place will serve.
We have deep water
to the shore,
we can see up
and down the river.
Our enemies will have
no advantage of surprise.
Bring the anchors
and midsails to shore,
in case some
homesick person
decides to slip
away with them.
We must be careful
not to offend the naturals.
If our crops fail,
we shall be obliged
to trade with them.
Once we're
established here,
we may go
up the river
and seek a route
to the other sea.
Sister!
The savages often
visit us kindly...
timid, like a herd
of curious deer.
Tonight we shall sleep
aboard our ships,
everyone in full armor.
In the morning,
we will chop down
every tree
within half a mile
of the moorage
and use
the straightest limbs
to erect a line of watchtowers
and to build our fort.
When we have done that,
we set our wheat
and barley,
put up houses
and lay in firewood.
Slackers will be whipped
at the site of their transgression.
- Sir.
- Yes, Emery.
When might we, uh,
be going out to...
poke about, sir?
We are not here
to pillage and raid.
We are here
to establish a colony.
How many lands
behind me?
Gold will do you no good.
Not six months from now,
when the snow has begun to fly.
How many seas?
What blows and dangers?
Fortune ever my friend.
Five kegs is gone since we landed.
Somebody stole 'em.
Rain's gotten to this,
and worms here.
- Brand him.
- And here.
Cut off his ears.
Captured
these two, sir,
talking to the men,
spying.
Hey, you!
He stole me hatchet!
We've lost the favor
of the naturals.
Had we not sighted land
the day we did,
I would have
turned back.
We have eaten
the majority of our stores,
our best men are
sick with fever,
the rest will soon
breed mutiny.
We might as well
be shipwrecked!
Now...
the naturals tell me, uh,
of a city
up the river
and of a mighty king
who lives there.
I propose we send
an envoy to this king
to see whether
he can be persuaded
to trade with us.
Meanwhile, I shall,
uh, return to England
for fresh supplies.
I'll not be back
until spring.
Radcliffe here
will be in command.
As to who
will approach
the savage king,
I needn't tell you
it will be
a hazardous mission.
Captain Smith is the only
professional soldier among us.
Smith, sir?
What are... what are...
what are his
qualifications?
Those you lack.
Smith, you have
an opportunity
to repair
your reputation.
I expect you
to welcome it.
Who are you
whom I so faintly hear?
Who urge me ever on?
You have the makings
of a leader, Smith.
Can one rely on you?
What voice is this
that speaks within me...
guides me
towards the best?
We shall make
a new start.
A fresh beginning.
Here the blessings
of the earth
are bestowed
upon all.
None need grow poor.
Here there is
good ground for all,
and no cost
but one's labor.
We shall build
a true commonwealth,
hard work and
self-reliance our virtues.
We shall have
no landlords
to rack us
with high rents
or extort
the fruit of our labor.
Captain, we haven't
the draft to go any further.
Put in.
None shall eat up
carelessly
what his friends
got worthily
or steal away that which virtue
has stored up.
Men shall not
make each other their spoil.
Let's go back, sir,
gather a larger party.
We're lost.
There the naturals go!
Let him go!
Tide's run out, Captain.
Bottom's dragging
on the mud, sir.
Keep your
matchlock lit.
Fire a shot
if you see anything.
The sun.
And the moon
as well.
It shows you how the sun
chases the night
continually around the world.
Ohh-hh.
The sky? No.
From England, a land
to the east.
Leave?
There won't be any leaving
till the spring.
The boats
won't be back till then.
We have...
articles that might
interest you.
Gunpowder.
At the moment
I was to die,
she threw herself
upon me.
Spare his life.
We must drive them away,
while they are still few.
If they do us no harm,
why should we care?
It's only a bit of
swampland they want.
For now.
But what will they take
in times to come?
He can teach her about
the land across the waves.
If they do not leave...
...we shall drive them
into the sea.
Sky.
Sky.
Sun.
Sun.
Water.
Wind. Wind.
Wind.
Wind.
Eyes.
Eyes.
Lips.
Lips.
Ear.
All the children
of the king were beautiful,
but she, the youngest,
was so exceedingly so
that the sun himself,
though he saw her often,
was surprised whenever she came out
into his presence.
Her father had
a dozen wives,
100 children,
but she was
his favorite.
She exceeded the rest
not only in feature and proportion,
but in wit
and spirit too.
All loved her.
Moon.
They are gentle,
loving,
faithful,
lacking in all guile
and trickery.
The words
denoting lying,
deceit, greed,
envy, slander
and forgiveness
have never been heard.
They have no jealousy,
no sense of possession.
Real,
what I thought
a dream.
Promise me -
You will put your people
before all else.
I know myself.
Even your own heart.
He is not one of us.
Love.
Shall we deny it
when it visits us?
Shall we not take
what we are given?
There is only this.
All else is unreal.
Mother...
where do you live?
In the sky?
The clouds?
The sea?
Show me your face.
Give me a sign.
We rise.
We rise.
Afraid of myself.
A god,
he seems to me.
What else is life
but being near you?
Do they suspect?
Oh, to be given
to you...
you to me.
I will be faithful
to you.
True.
Two no more.
One.
One.
I am.
I am.
The king announced
that I was free.
He was
sending me back
and on the understanding
that when spring came
we were to go back
to where we came from.
His chiefs
had advised him to kill me.
I had gained a knowledge
of their arms,
their strong places.
But his daughter assured him
I was a good man.
I should tell people
that though the naturals lived in peace,
they yet were strong
and would not suffer their land
to be taken away.
There was no sea
beyond the mountains,
only a land
stretching away forever
in great meadows.
A land
which had no end.
Captain Smith.
You're back.
The savages will have
to stop here, Captain.
- Where have you been?
- It's like seeing a ghost.
Yeah, you look like you've
come back from the dead.
What's happened here?
Where's Captain Radcliffe?
- No word. Gone.
- Shut your mouth!
- You shoulda never trusted him.
- People say he went over to England.
- We're starving.
- Did you bring food?
- I brought food.
- Someone got killed. Just fell over.
Four months of stealing and
stealing and stealing and stealing.
- Look at him. Bastard.
- Get up!
Gambling. They bowl
- while the houses fall down.
- Gambling.
- Look at the church. We don't even...
- All the sickness that's been
- coming in from the marsh.
- Who's taking care of you?
- No one.
- That's all it is,
- just dying and sickness and all that.
- Hey, I saw a body
- in the mud.
- You're a liar!
- I saw a leg in the bed.
- You are a liar!
- Four people died last night...
- Why was the leg in the bed?
...and they're eating 'em.
- Why was the leg in the bed?
Thieves! Jackals!
Lash their feet!
You're looking
rather well, Smith.
Been enjoying yourself,
have you?
Been enjoying yourself
mightily,
I expect.
You were sent to relieve
our situation,
not to pleasure yourself.
We here have suffered.
I'll ignore the stories
which bring officials only disrepute.
No speeches, Smith.
Things are different now.
We can't allow cheek.
Allow cheek, and we
shall have chaos.
I wear the medal now.
I am President,
and you have been stripped
of your captaincy.
Are you qualified
to pass judgment on me?
Well, that really needn't concern us
at the moment.
'Tis a pity
you were not here
at the time of your trial
to defend yourself.
I presume
you were too afraid,
too guilty to return.
- My trial?
- Yes.
You were indicted
upon a chapter in Leviticus
and tried during the period
of your desertion.
Our law
is speedy here.
Been keeping all the good food
for himself, Smith.
Giving us
rotten corn.
You, sir, have no other
eyes and ears
than those which grow
on Smith's head here.
He does nothing but tend his
own pot, his spit and oven.
I have shared all.
I have kept nothing for myself.
- Nothing!
- His name is not even Wingfield.
It's Woodson.
Woodson is the name.
Left England
under a cloud of disgrace.
Seize them.
Seize them!
Any man impeding
the punishment of these rogues
will be dealt with harshly.
Here.
There's no sense in waiting for a trial.
This is mutiny.
I dispatch you herewith
in the name of the king.
Dead as an herring.
Serves him right.
I can ratify
what Mr. Argall said.
Were we in England
I should be ashamed to let my servant
- keep company with such fellows.
- You never had a servant.
You were a servant.
I ate a single chicken,
and that when I were ill.
Small here has eaten six,
a number of which
he could not be troubled to cook.
I say it's Captain Smith
should lead us.
Aye.
Tell her.
Tell her what?
It was a dream.
Withdraw! March!
Now I am awake.
- March!
- St. George! St. George!
St. George, St. George.
Don't push and shove now.
Watch it!
St. George,
St... St. George.
St. George.
I let her love me.
I made her love me.
And what was your
disagreement about?
He said today is
the 15th of October.
I said the 17th.
I must.
You were fighting
about the day
of the year?
Damnation is like this.
Didn't I tell you to dig a new well
farther from the shore?
Why hasn't this
been done?
Every man will stop
what he's doing right now
and start digging the well!
Those of you
that can't carry
the dirt in buckets
shall carry it
with your own hands!
He that will not work
shall not eat!
The labors of honest
and industrious men
shall not be consumed
to maintain the idleness of a few!
The country is to them
a misery,
a death,
a hell.
Mind yourself, mate.
While they starve,
they dig for gold.
There is no talk,
no hope, no work
but this.
If there's so much gold,
why don't the naturals have any?
You're chasing a dream.
You see what men
they've sent us.
A headless multitude.
They will not sow corn
for their own bellies.
They will rather eat their fish raw
than go a stone's throw
and fetch some wood
to dress it.
Bad water.
Sturgeon gone.
- Mutterings.
...the waste cities, they shall
live in them. They shall plant vineyards
and drink the wine.
In that day...
- Love good and hate evil!
- I will raise up the tent of David...
and close up
the breaches of his tent.
Take away from me
the noise of your music
and your songs,
so I will not hear
- the melody of thy harp.
- The Lord has given the command,
and He will smash them...
large house into pieces
and the small house
into bits!
Somebody should shoot
Small there.
He hasn't got a ghost of a chance,
and he'll contaminate us all.
He used Wortham's spoon...
now Wortham's gone,
my friend.
Have we got to wait
till all is dead?
Sir, Ackley's dead.
Somebody ate
his hands.
Went out in the height
of style, anyhow.
Such tranquility,
you'd think
he could speak.
I shall miss him.
I think we all shall.
We're 38 now.
To go back up that river.
To love her
in the wild.
What holds you here?
What are your intentions
towards her?
Towards them?
There's nothing in the river.
The river's empty.
We wanna go back
to England. Please, can we?
Please can we go back
to England, please?
- Where's Captain Newport?
- Gone for sure. There's nothing to eat.
Captain Newport
will be back shortly.
- Does he have food?
- He'd better.
- When will we go back to England?
- We're starving.
When will we go...
they're eating all the dead.
Do you believe
in ghosts, Captain?
People don't care
about the Indians no more.
Don't put yourself
in danger.
You don't have to do
anything else...
for us.
Why have you
not come to me?
I know, my love.
Don't trust me.
You don't know
who I am.
Remember.
Thank you.
God be with you.
God bless.
May Almighty God bless you.
May God be with you.
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
Thank you kindly.
Who are you
whom I love?
There's something I know
when I'm with you
that I forget
when I'm away.
Tell me, my love,
did you wish for me
to come back and live with you again?
Free.
My true light.
Can love lie?
My America.
Where are you,
my love?
That fort is not
the world.
The river leads
back there.
It leads onward too.
Deeper.
Into the wild.
Start over.
Exchange this false life
for a true one.
Give up
the name of Smith.
They do not intend to leave.
Who gave them the seed?
Come away.
You must tell me why.
They can't hear.
I've sent them away.
He sees
you mean to stay.
They're coming.
Make peace with him.
He won't accept peace.
Why would he?
- Come away.
- And where would we live?
In the woods?
On a treetop?
A hole
in the ground?
You have to come
with me...
into the fort.
Your people will know you came here.
They'll find out
soon enough.
Go! On the double,
gentlemen!
God save the king!
- Port your pikes!
- God save the king!
- Port your pikes!
- God save the king!
Charge!
And on the Swiss step,
gentlemen...
- march!
- St. George,
St. George, St. George!
- Prepare to stand!
- St. George, St. George!
- Stand!
- St. George, St. George!
Musketeers advance!
Fire!
Hold the ground!
Hold together, men!
- You're like a herd of deer!
- What are you waiting for?
How can you own land?!
This earth was made
for such that shall improve it
and knows how to live!
They have no sound, sir,
but I couldn't...
Fire on him!
What are you waiting for?
Fire on him!
You heathen bastards!
Please don't. Please. Please.
Seeds of sulfur!
Sons of fire!
Devils in the mouth of hell!
Please don't.
Please don't. Please don't.
Retreat!
Fall back!
Lord,
turn not away Thy face.
You desire not
the death of a sinner.
I have gone away
from You.
I have not harkened
to Your voice.
Let us not be brought
to nothing.
- Gather reinforcements!
- They're climbing up the wall!
You were the light of my life.
My joy.
I cannot give you over to die.
I am too old to bear it.
Forgive me, father.
I am sending you away.
This is the last time
we shall speak.
You are no longer my child.
Tell him.
The princess is
up the river at Pastancy.
They sent her
to her Uncle Patowomeck,
lord of the naked devils
of that region
and, by the by,
an acquaintance of mine.
So I get talking to His Nibs, and he
proposes to sell her.
He says with her
at the fort,
the emperor will not dare attack us.
He dotes on her.
You're certain
she's the one you saw?
With these eyes.
I spoke to the king directly.
And what does this rogue
propose to sell her for?
Well, I was getting to that.
His most favorite thing is combs.
But in this case, he seems
to have his heart set on a kettle.
You know, a copper kettle,
like my mother had for making stew.
What use he means to make
of the instrument I cannot say.
Well?
We don't take
hostages.
King James
would not approve.
- You'd rather see us annihilated?
- She's done enough for us.
She risked a beating in
of her own brains to save mine.
Had she not fed us,
you would have starved.
She's been the instrument
to preserve this colony from disaster.
- Flesh fly!
- She and her...
We shall not return her kindness
by making her a captive!
Come, Argall,
threaten me!
Then I'd know
I was gonna live for 1,000 years.
She and her lot
are on the verge of killing us all.
I expect there will be
scarce a handful alive
when the boats return,
if they ever do.
You told us yourself that her father
regards her as no one else.
Or do you have
private reasons
for that attitude
of yours?
Return to your post.
The penalty for disobeying
an order of the president is hanging.
You're breaking the laws.
This is mutiny.
Me breaking the laws.
I have information
Smith here
is planning
to marry the wench
and make himself
King of Virginia.
You're no longer
in command, Smitty.
I shall wear
the medal now.
You've been derelict
in your duties to the king.
You've betrayed
these citizens of Jamestown.
I therefore
pronounce you unworthy
of being a member
of this colony.
You are no longer
in command, Smitty!
Oh oh oh,
high and mighty,
lord and ruler.
No! No!
We must have order, huh?
We can't have everyone
running around
giving themselves
airs and graces,
'cause then... then we
would have chaos! Huh?
- Scream.
- Come near.
- Getting the strokes.
- Come near me.
You say... you say,
"Friend, friend, dear friend..."
- You touch me now.
- "I pray to the gods
for your good health
for the rest of my life. I will."
No man shows me disrespect.
In all things
may I stand by you.
Put him to hard labor.
Send him to the forest
to hew fresh timbers for the walls.
Set him by the heels
each night when he's done,
that through
the long watches
he might reflect
on his transgressions.
Oh Mother,
has he sent
this ship for me?
Conscience is nuisance.
A fly,
a barking dog.
If you don't believe
you have one,
what trouble
can it be to you?
Mother,
you are my strength,
or I have none.
Throw us
your forward line!
Steady she is.
The president.
Yes, I neglected
to tell you.
The captain's no longer
occupying that post.
He will be able
to explain the reasons
better than I.
It's the princess.
This will be
your house, my lady.
Reverend Whitaker,
the one what lived here,
well, he is...
he's dead and gone now, so...
The ships returned,
firing their cannons,
causing the naturals
to sue for peace.
The tide now swung
to the English side.
They said they were
going to fetch you.
I was against it.
I didn't want
to harm you.
And now there's
disaster all around us.
We should have stopped
before it was too late.
What is right?
Give.
Wrong?
Who is this man?
Now...
all is perfect.
Let me be lost.
True.
You flow through me
like a river.
Come.
Follow me.
O Lord, thank you.
Captain.
Very well.
Leave us alone.
You wish to bring charges
against this man?
Are you sure?
Well, fine then,
Argall,
enough of your
quarrels. Be off.
I have news
for you.
The king wants you
to return to England
to prepare an expedition
of your own...
to chart
the northern coasts
to see if you might find
a passage to the Indies.
I remember when you had
sight and ambition.
Shall you not
press on?
Shall you be
a discoverer of passages
which you yourself
refuse to explore
beyond the threshold
that is?
King has great hopes
for you.
Plans.
Um, she's to take
care of you now.
Uh, my name's Mary.
And yours,
I believe is...
Oh no, um, she says that's not
her name anymore.
She hasn't got
a name.
Oh, how unfortunate.
Well, we shall have
to give you one!
Here.
Rub with the towel.
I will find joy
in all I see.
Just little steps.
Ohh-hh.
We shall lose
not only our lives
and our land,
but our eternal
birthright.
Look beyond
these gates.
Eden lies
about us still.
We have escaped
the Old World
and its bondage.
Let us make
a new beginning
and create a fresh example
for humanity.
We are the pioneers
of the world,
the advance guard
sent on through the wilderness
to break a new path.
And our youth is
our strength,
and our inexperience
our wisdom.
God has given us
a promised land,
a great inheritance.
Woe betide if ever
we turn our back on him.
Let us prepare a land
where a man may rise
to his true stature,
a land of the future,
a new kingdom
of the spirit.
Remember
what this country was...
Am I as you like?
His eyes.
You knew me
as I was
long ago.
I have never
truly been the man
I seem to you to be.
What does he say?
Come, let's sit
by the river.
Mean?
I can't sleep
till I see you again.
Look up.
You have no evil.
I belong to you.
He knows.
Where am I?
Wait two months...
then tell her
I am dead.
Drowned.
Like that.
He's left you, Princess.
He told you
a pack of lies.
Forget about him.
I, uh, have some
terrible news.
Captain Smith
is dead.
He drowned
in the crossing.
He loved you
very much.
You have gone away
with my life.
Killed the god in me.
When first I saw her,
she was regarded
as someone finished,
broken, lost.
She seemed
barely to notice
the others about her.
Um, I would like to spend
the afternoon with you.
How do I ask?
A nature like yours
can turn trouble
into good.
All this sorrow
will give you strength
and point you
on a higher way.
Think of a tree,
how it grows
around its wounds.
If a branch breaks off,
it don't stop
but keeps reaching
towards the light.
We must meet
misfortune boldly
and not suffer it
to frighten us.
We must
act the play out,
then live our troubles down,
my lady.
April, May,
and June, July,
August.
What is a day?
- A day?
- An hour?
An hour is
60 minutes.
Why does the earth
have colors?
Name this person.
Rebecca.
Rebecca, I baptize thee
in the name
of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
Amen.
She has accepted
my invitation
- to work in the fields.
- For Rebecca.
She'll be missed.
She understands
the culture of tobacco.
She's a good lass.
The people were sorry
at her going.
The loss of my wife
and daughter
has led me to understand
her loss as well.
Hours pass,
she speaks
not a word.
Who are you?
What do you
dream of?
We're like grass.
Are you kind?
She weaves all things
together.
I touched her
long ago...
without knowing
her name.
Suppose I asked you
to marry me.
What would you say?
Are you asking me?
Where would we live?
Here.
England, if you wish.
Perhaps that would be best.
We could...
well, you could forget your life
in this place.
Why do you
shrink from me?
Won't you say yes?
If you like.
This isn't
what I expected,
Rebecca.
I'm sorry.
Why are you crying?
I suppose...
I must be happy.
You do not
love me now.
Someday you will.
I require and charge you
as you will answer
on the dreadful day of judgment
when the secrets
of all hearts are disclosed,
that if you know
any impediment
why you should not be
lawfully joined together
in matrimony,
you will confess it.
Mother,
why can I not feel
as I should?
Must?
Once false,
I must not be again.
Take out the thorn.
He is like a tree.
He shelters me.
I lie in his shade.
Can I ignore
my heart?
What is from you
and what is not?
Great Sun,
I offer you thanks.
You give life
to the trees
and the hills...
to the streams
of water...
to all.
Mother,
your love
is before my eyes.
Show me your way.
Teach me your path.
Give me
a humble heart.
We've had some
surprising news.
We've been invited
to England
by the king and queen.
There will be
a royal audience
in your honor.
You're known
to them all.
So, his first mate,
isn't it?
Gave him up to pirates
when his ship was stopped.
Five years before he could
get a commission.
Five years!
All them ships
went off to Newfoundland.
- Yes.
- Who would have guessed?
He poked around the north,
then he went home.
Captain Smith.
Yeah, he could
make you laugh.
Things are
different now.
Hmm. They've sent him
back to London.
What a shame. They say
he's done much for this place.
Captain Smith
is alive?
You saw him?
I cannot do that.
Why not?
It would mean something
I do not feel.
What's come over you?
I'm married...
to him.
He lives.
I heard it by the fort.
He's still alive.
"Married"?
You don't know
the meaning
of the word exactly.
But I am.
Sweet wife...
Iove made the bond.
Love can
break it too.
There is that in her
I shall not know.
Your father has sent me.
For each Englishman
I come across,
I am to place a notch
on these sticks.
And to see this God
they speak so much about.
Step aside, mate!
"...homage sweetly pay,
Whilst towering
in the azure sky
They celebrate
this happy day.
Let rolling streams
their gladness show
With gentle murmurs
whilst they play
And in their
wild meanders flow
Rejoicing
in this blessed day.
Kind health descends
on downy wings,
Angels conduct her
on the way.
The New World's Princess
new life brings
And swells our joys
upon this day."
I think you still
love the man
and that you will not
be at peace
until you see him.
In my vanity,
I thought...
I could make you
love me,
and one cannot
do that,
or should not.
You have walked...
blindly...
into a situation
that you did not anticipate.
You are the man
I thought you were.
And more.
Did I make a mistake
in coming here?
I would have
come before,
except I've been
away from the capital.
Perhaps,
I'm out of order
speaking with you
this way,
but I've thought
of you often.
So after I left,
it went well for you.
I heard the king and queen
received you.
Everybody says you were
a great favorite.
They all speak of you.
One hears them in the streets.
"Her Ladyship."
Who would have guessed it?
You knew
I had promise,
didn't you?
Yes.
Did you find
your Indies, John?
You shall.
I may have sailed
past them.
I thought
it was a dream...
what we knew
in the forest.
It's the only truth.
It seems as if I were
speaking to you for the first time.
Could we not go home?
As soon as possible.
My husband.
Listen.
Thomas. Where are you?
Mother,
now I know
where you live.
"13th of April, 1616."
- Mother. Mother.
- "Dear son,
I write this
so that someday in the future
you might understand
a circumstance
which shall be
but a far memory to you.
Your dear mother,
Rebecca,
fell ill
in our outward passage
at Gravesend.
She gently reminded me
that all must die.
'Tis enough,'
she said,
that you, our child,
should live."
