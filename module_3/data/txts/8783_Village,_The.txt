Hey kid, we got you on camera.
Am I calling the cops
or your principal?
I hear you're leaving us today.
Got somewhere to go?
Friend gave me a lead on a sublet.
Yeah? How's your head?
Depends.
You hear that chopper landing too?
How's your heart?
Broken years ago. It's why I enlisted.
You take care of that
next, you hear me?
Sir, yes sir.
Janet.
Thank you for everything.
- You did not just do that.
- What?
What?
- Alanna, come on.
- No, I get it.
It... it could've been an emergency.
Like this?
Enzo and Bernie. Cough it up, fellas.
My lung? You're too late.
I hacked it into a
tissue 20 minutes ago.
Your stash.
Viagra, cough medicine,
whatever else you've been hocking.
No idea what you're talking about.
Louis Mendoza nearly drowned
in a pudding cup this morning.
He was high and excited.
Death by chocolate. Who wouldn't be?
Hey, that's a violation of my rights.
Yeah, wait till I get
to the cavity search.
Seducing me won't work either.
Wake him up.
He's not asleep.
Hasn't been long.
You got away clean.
You know, most people
don't have a lifelong friend.
I guess I'm most people now.
Uh, yeah, this is Sarah.
I don't understand.
Uh, no, no, of course.
I'll be right down.
Enzo...
No, go, go.
Nothing's changing here, sweetheart.
- I'll be back, okay?
- Yeah.
Hey Sarah,
what's wrong with your pharmacy?
They don't give out cough medicine?
They do when someone's coughing.
- He's selling it.
- What are you talking about?
Gabriel, what'd you do, crawl here?
Hey, go easy on him. Bernie died.
Sign me out. We're taking a walk.
Pops, I'm already late. I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.
How long has this been going on for?
I just found out.
Listen, tells you he's congested?
Just say no.
No, no, no, no, no!
Pops, I got, like, one minute, okay?
One minute. You got your whole future.
Which is jeopardized
every time I'm late
because of a bogus emergency.
You see this?
The world's tiniest violin.
Buy me a coffee.
The stuff at the home tastes
like I steeped my balls.
One coffee.
Sarah told me about Bernie.
I don't want to talk about it.
Do you want to talk about why
you're selling cough medicine?
I'm a river to my people.
I'm sorry about Bernie, I am.
Okay, but you can't tell me
you're sick if you're not
and you can't sell drugs to old people.
Did you just tip a ten?
Eh, big deal. Bill another hour.
I don't bill hours. I'm in law school.
Seriously?
Sit.
You look good.
You look good too.
I look like somebody
beat me with a baseball bat
and sewed me into a
costume I can't take off.
I don't wanna live there, Gabie.
The home?
Well, what's the alternative?
Oh, come on. It's a one bedroom.
I got a girlfriend.
We're... we're intimate.
That's what stoops are for.
Gimme a shot, kid.
Bernie didn't age out, you know, he...
he was bored to death.
I ain't done living.
You know you forget things.
It's better for you there.
It can't be the scariest
building you've ever entered.
Different kind of scary.
Here you go.
Thanks for the ride.
Thanks for your service.
Staff Sergeant Porter.
Just Nick is fine. And you are?
I'm Ron, I'm The Village super.
- Uh, I got your key.
- Okay.
Look, the whole building is
very excited to have you, son.
Yeah, why is that?
Very patriotic.
Uh, let me give you
a hand with that bag.
Nope, it's okay. I got it.
Arms still work.
They did tell you it was a walk
up, right?
No one patriotic on the first floor?
Kidding.
Just, uh...
don't tell my team I
gave up my gear, huh?
I got it.
Your secret's safe.
You're under this roof, you're family.
Come on.
So what do you think?
She's a decorator.
No, he. Him.
Tim and Felipe,
they're in Rome teaching English.
I don't know if you were told,
but they're refusing rent.
I don't understand.
Tim lost a brother in Iraq.
Speaking of,
let me be the first to say
thank you for your service.
Yeah.
Guessing that, uh,
I'm not the first, huh?
Nah, it's fine. Um, thank you.
Everybody means well, it just...
well, it sounds like
they're ordering a latte.
You mind if I ask how it happened?
Uh...
IED took out our Humvee.
Driver was killed instantly, um...
a couple of other guys
were picked off by snipers.
- Oh.
- I was able to find cover.
You're lucky to be alive.
No, it wasn't luck.
It was a bomb dog named Jedi.
Sensed I was in distress
and crawled on top
of me to keep me safe
even though his leg was crushed.
Kept me warm until they pulled me out.
Look, I own this little bar, Smalls.
I could sure use a hand.
You know, I'm still a little
iffy on the old peg leg, so...
No, business is slow
and there's a stool.
Come on, let's take a tour of
the neighborhood and pop in.
Thank you. Yeah,
I'm actually waiting for a delivery.
Give 'em your cell.
Come on, this is the first day
of the rest of your life, son.
Come on now, let's get out there.
What's been going on with you lately?
Nothing,
I was suspended for crocheting.
For vandalism.
You know, I hear the punishment
for needlepoint is crucifixion.
What possessed you to cut up a fence?
The price of zip-ties go up?
No, they're building corporate offices
for Allied Dynamics.
- And you heart them?
- And I don't want a war-profiteering
missile manufacturer in my backyard.
Okay, okay, so... so it was a...
a crocheted political statement?
Katie, what the hell is your problem?
You are not pregnant.
What are you, wishing it away?
You're not having sex.
Well, if that's your second wish,
your third one should definitely have
some dollar signs.
Who were you having sex with?
Beat it!
Mom.
Hey, I am asking you to explain this.
You know, I think it's
pretty widely understood.
- Like how to use a condom?
- Condoms!
See, we used a banana peel.
Nobody's laughing, Katie.
Then what are you doing?
Judging me, seriously?
You did the same thing, Mom,
which means you know
exactly how scared I am.
The part where I screwed
up, I am crystal clear on.
Stop, that's my third wish.
Really? Wish three?
You could've made
Beyonc√© your best friend.
Yeah, well, I already have one of those
and I just totally blew it with her.
Do-over?
I'm pregnant.
It's gonna be okay.
What the...?
You're kidding me.
- Detention center?
- You are undocumented.
This is my home!
No, no, I have my paperwork!
I need you to calm down, ma'am.
Ben, tell them you know me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
What's... okay, relax.
What's going on here?
They're harassing me for being brown.
Okay, this... this is my
building, okay?
She's legal.
I know her, she's my neighbor.
There's a warrant.
For what?
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, relax, relax.
It's okay. This is obviously a mistake.
Ava, if they have a warrant...
they're not... they're not
just gonna walk away.
What are you saying?
I should go with them?
I've done nothing wrong!
Okay, then don't do
something wrong now.
- What?
- Mom?
Why... why is he home?
He's sick.
Take your hands off my son!
- I'm calling Family Services.
- That's enough!
- That's enough, I will take him.
- Okay.
She will go with you peacefully.
We will get this figured out.
What's happening?
Sami, these men made a mistake, okay?
I'm gonna go and clear it up.
You need to let me go, okay? Okay.
It's okay.
Please... please call Patricia.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why are you letting them take her?
- I... Sami!
- Mom! Mom!
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>
They were waiting for her?
<i>Patricia, I'm gonna need your help.</i>
<i>Can you make it down to immigration?</i>
Of course, Ben.
Um, I'm in a meeting right now,
but I'll-I'll get down
there as soon as I can.
Where's Sami?
<i>Oh, I got him. Talk soon.</i>
Okay.
So...
good news?
Overkill, much?
Why didn't you tell
me you have a boyfriend?
Because I don't.
But you do know who the
potential father is, right?
Well, I definitely
have it narrowed down
to the basketball team.
I'm not trying to slut-shame you.
Yeah, I'm just gonna go
drown myself in the toilet.
Do you like him?
This boy?
Yeah.
Does he like you?
I think so.
Are you gonna tell him?
Well, it's gonna be awkward now.
All three means triplets, right?
Katie, Katie,
please don't walk away.
Hey, look at me.
I love you and...
Can we please not talk about abortion
in a nursing home hallway?
Is that what you're going to do?
You think I want some kid
who's going to ruin my life?
You did not ruin my life.
Look around, Mom.
Katie, listen,
having you was impossibly hard
and I do not want
that struggle for you,
- but I'm okay...
- No.
No, you're amazing,
which is why you could've
had so much more,
but instead you had me.
- Sarah!
- Oh, damn it.
I need you.
- See you later.
- Um...
No, it's fine.
It's your boss.
We can't both get suspended.
Uh, can... can you give
me just one minute?
Ava?
Oh!
I came as soon as I could.
I'm so sorry, baby.
Ten years I've lived here.
I pay taxes here, I gave birth here.
They just told me that
your papers are forged.
Is that true, Ava?
I don't know.
You don't have to lie to me.
I'm not lying.
It could be true.
I didn't speak the language.
My ex-husband handled
all the paperwork.
I trusted him.
Well, now you're gonna trust me.
I'm gonna find you a lawyer, okay?
With what money?
I know, but listen to me,
you've been caged twice
before in your life,
once in your country
and then in your marriage
and what did you do?
You fought because you're a fighter.
That's what you're gonna do now.
I want you to say that to me.
I'm going to fight.
Ava...
I want you to think of Sami.
Now you say it to me again.
I'm going to fight.
These poor men laid a
trap for a defenseless woman
who have no idea they just
caught themselves a tiger.
That's it.
Like you're churning ice
cream with your body.
What are you humping chairs for?
Wait for it.
And we're churning, and we're churning,
Aye, booty.
At the expense of your pride.
It's a small price to pay.
Come on,
they left the loading docks open.
Let's go live a little.
For Bernie.
Come on.
Ta-da!
Okay, look,
I... I know what you're thinking.
Yeah? I didn't mean it.
No, no, wait till you get inside.
Come on.
In the '60s,
this bar was a haven for freethinkers.
Now when not all people
could go everywhere,
all people could come here,
and come they did.
Mmm.
Yeah, it's cool.
No, no, see, you're not getting it.
Jackie Robinson,
Langston Hughes, Dr. King,
and up on that stage, Ella Fitzgerald,
Cecil Taylor,
Sonny Rollins.
I mean, this whole room
filled with smoke and poetry.
I swear, sometimes in the quiet,
I can still hear their ghosts.
And what do they say?
What's a guy gotta do to
get a drink around here?
Enzo?
What are you doing here?
We busted out of that suicide
parlor they call a home.
Meet my new barkeep,
Staff Sergeant Porter.
Just Nick and maybe.
It's nice to meet you.
Army Specialist Lorenzo Napolitano.
Thank you for your sacrifice, Sergeant.
George Reese, 51st radio company.
Nice to meet you, sir.
Petty Officer Third Class,
Walter Barns, USS Valley Forge.
It's an honor.
Oh sorry, honey.
Time's up.
There's a clock on self-pity?
No, it's just this closet.
It's the only one
without a smoke detector.
We have it heavily scheduled.
Velma, I can't let you smoke that.
If we're not smoking, we're talking.
Spill.
Katie blames herself
for my unhappiness.
Are you unhappy?
It's just...
the situation... it's a little
more complicated than that.
Well, while you're un-complicating it,
Bernie's grandson is here
packing up his things.
He's cute.
If I was 34, I'd jump him like a rope.
Velma, his grandfather just died.
Gather your rosebuds, carpe the diem,
ask the kid to coffee.
Maybe give your daughter
less to blame herself for.
Come on.
It's called a matzo ball.
Had a partner who claimed they
worked better than aspirin.
You're worried about your mom, huh?
Sami...
you can talk to me.
Be right back.
Hey, um...
I need to bring a kid
down to the station.
Yeah, yeah, I just need
someone to keep an eye on him
- till my shift's over...
- Hey, Officer.
I think your perp just escaped.
<i>Look, I totally get it. It's awful.</i>
Listen, the pro bono attorneys
are up to their ears
in hundreds of cases.
At least they actually know the law.
And you actually know Ava and Sami!
I'm a social worker, I've seen this,
but she can't afford real help.
Inexperienced help that gives
a damn is the next best thing.
Patricia, I can't practice law yet.
I was already late to my internship.
I can't be late to class too.
She's our neighbor, Gabe.
We help.
Pop stole my credit card.
I gotta go.
I'll drop by, see what I can find out.
It's all I can promise.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey.
Um, I'm John.
Sarah.
I'm so sorry about Bernie.
Oh yeah, thanks. Me too.
Uh, mostly that I
didn't know him better.
He seems to have liked the mafia.
He said he had a son in Seattle.
- Your dad?
- Yeah, they, uh...
they had a falling out years ago.
My only adult excuse is distance.
Ironically, I just moved here
kind of hoping to
start another chapter...
I'm sorry,
do you... do you smell pastries?
No, but that's because you
can't really smell yourself.
You smell like baked goods?
I'm a pastry chef.
Just rented a storefront,
been testing recipes and...
You think that's odd.
No, no, no, I, uh,
I was actually thinking if we
all smelled like where we work,
I should never step outside again.
I'm sure you smell great.
My daughter vomited in
my purse this morning.
I should go.
Uh, so nice meeting you.
Yeah, you too.
Uh, so listen,
for reasons I'm not really
comfortable getting into,
I need to look happy and
fulfilled for my daughter,
and for an entirely separate reason
that I definitely will not discuss,
I need to look like I'm not
catastrophically single tonight.
Sorry, are you asking me out?
Only if the answer is yes.
I can't handle rejection today.
<i>A ham sandwich walks into a bar,</i>
the bartender says we
don't serve food here.
Uh-oh.
Hey, here's my grandson?
I buy you a coffee,
you steal my credit card?
Oh, I have no idea, you know?
I forget things, remember?
What are you doing here, Pops?
Who signed you out?
What am I, a library book?
Look, you can't up and disappear.
They'll call the cops.
I haven't heard any sirens.
I'm calling the home.
What the hell are you doing?
I don't need some kid tattling.
Some kid, you serious?
After everything I've done?
Give me the card.
We need it for a car service.
Bernie and I were planning
a little trip down...
Yeah, you're... you're
not going on a trip.
This'll get you home.
Give me the card.
And the bad news is
we're closing early.
But the good news is we
throw a little shindig
on the Village roof every third Friday.
Uh, it's not the third Friday.
- I bumped it for you.
- Oh.
I hope you like shaking hands.
Now I'm gonna give Sarah a call
and have her sign you
three out for real.
Uh, here. Hang on.
They got a little trip to take first.
Thank you.
It's my pleasure.
I shouldn't even be telling you,
but she might need you.
<i>Of course. I won't say a word.</i>
Who am I kidding? I'm telling
you because I might need you.
You already have me
24/7, you know that.
See you on the roof?
Yeah. Thank you.
Mama.
There you are.
Sorry, "mama" is the
only word she knows.
Come here, want to go to the park?
Look, she's not a mommy.
<i>Which way should we go?</i>
<i>You want to go to the park?</i>
Sorry, gents, closed for maintenance.
When I was 22,
my friend and I worked here.
We lost him today.
Well, what are you looking to do?
Remember.
Coming out?
I guess I'll come in.
Any session you want, man.
It's super healing.
That sounds great, yeah. Thanks.
Of course.
Pow.
What the hell is a "sound bath"?
Uh, you lay on the ground.
They rub a crystal bowl with a rock.
It's outstanding.
I need a drink. You want something?
I do, but not booze.
You go ahead.
All right.
I see you
and my soul grows deep like the rivers.
Langston Hughes?
Ron Davis.
You cannot change a couple of words
and claim that as your own.
It's my roof,
I'll do as I like,
and what I'd like to do right now...
is dance with my lady.
32 years dancing with the same woman,
a man can feel when something is wrong.
Patricia, what is it?
It's just a...
It's just a hard day.
Just... it's just Ava.
Hmm.
You'll go before a judge
in the next couple days.
Best case scenario,
he agrees to a grant bond.
If you pay it,
you can fight your case from home.
And if I'm deported...
what happens to Sami?
Well, he was born here
so he can stay or...
you know, he... he could go with you.
To Iran?
- No.
- Look, Ava, you need someone good.
I need a lot of things,
they aren't available to me.
Neither am I.
It's not because I
wouldn't love to help.
I literally can't practice law yet.
I was born in a place
where I had no voice.
No hope of ever being heard.
So I traveled 6,000 miles
as a refugee,
learned a new language,
found work, bore a child,
and I took care of him alone.
All so I can earn a voice,
which I am using now to tell you this.
There is always a way
around every obstacle,
but you need to care enough to find it.
Please care enough.
The day you moved in,
Sami thought a superhero had landed.
Now I'm the guy who
lets bad guys take Mom.
Guess it's time to fold up the cape.
I don't know,
I think superheroes are overrated.
They just fly in and save the day.
Takes a real man to stick around
and deal with the carnage.
All right, everybody, eyes up here.
Eyes up here.
Come on now.
<i>You've reached the Glasser
Cancer Treatment Center.</i>
<i>Please leave your message at the tone.</i>
Hi, this is Patricia Davis.
I'm sorry to call so late,
but I will take that 4:00 appointment.
Thank you.
All right, now my life, my love,
my wife Patricia and I
would like to welcome
Staff Sergeant Nick
Porter to the Village.
Yay!
Now Sarah, who volunteers at the VA,
she brought him home knowing
that we would lift him up.
So do so or at least
stop by and say hello.
Nick, may you heal and
find new purpose here.
Cheers!
- Thank you.
- To Nick!
Empty apartment, huh?
Might have a few leads on work?
Yeah, I might have undersold
the whole Village experience.
- Hmm.
- We're nothing if not enthusiastic.
- John.
- Hey.
Sarah told me about your ordeal.
Thank you for your service.
Thanks.
Oh, sorry. Oh, you know what?
I have a, uh,
delivery that's just showing up, um...
It's great to meet you, John.
- Yeah, you too.
- All right, excuse me.
Did I say something wrong?
No, I'm sure it's fine.
Come on.
So this daughter
you need to look happy
and fulfilled for,
am I gonna meet her here?
It depends.
Do I look happy and fulfilled?
You look pretty.
So John, who smells like baked goods,
late 30s, cross-country move,
hoping for a new chapter?
How long you been divorced?
Long enough to know she wasn't the one.
Do you believe in that?
One in six billion is perfect for you?
I like to believe in things.
You're missing a party.
Got a lot on my plate.
I'm sorry for getting angry.
I worry, you know?
I shouldn't have taken your credit card
or tossed your phone in a beer.
Or sold drugs to old people.
Ah, drugs are wasted on the young.
Here.
I couldn't find a peace pipe
so I settled on tequila.
You okay?
Sure.
I'm gonna miss Bernie too.
He gave me the worst dating advice.
Big talk.
The guy fell in love
with the ring toss girl
and he married her a month later.
It's kind of crazy you
met all your best friends
at an amusement park.
Family's where you find it, kid.
Hey, hey! There he is!
He's decommissioned. All yours.
Come on, boy! What is it? What is it?
Hey, uh...
We don't normally kiss in public.
Well,
it's a pretty liberal neighborhood.
You're the new soldier guy?
My mom told me that you were moving in.
You're Sarah's daughter.
Katie.
I like your shirt.
Uh, yeah,
I have a lot of issues with war.
Me too.
- Oh, I can help you.
- No, it's okay.
It's okay. Thank you.
I'm Nick Porter
and this... this is Jedi.
You guys just meet?
Well, we got a little bit of history.
Well, uh, it was nice to meet you.
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.
Hey.
Hey, this was nice.
I'm pretty sure she just
picked him up somewhere.
I think it's good.
She'll need company
when you're in jail.
Allied Dynamics?
You're the one who said that
somebody needed to protest.
Have you ever heard of a picket sign?
You didn't teach me how
to crochet one of those.
You are my kind of girl.
Good night.
Good night.
<i>He seems nice.</i>
<i>I heard about Ava.</i>
<i>Yeah, I thought we could all</i>
<i>pitch in helping Ben take care of Sami.</i>
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>
<i>Sarah...</i>
<i>whatever she decides,
she has one thing that you didn't have.</i>
<i>You for a mother.</i>
<i>Only a 17-year-old
would be on her phone</i>
<i>with a view like this.</i>
<i>You had a date.</i>
<i>Bought a lottery ticket too.</i>
<i>I could be rich and
married by next week.</i>
<i>Well, if he's not a serial killer,</i>
<i>he's kind of cute.</i>
<i>And divorced.</i>
<i>Any port in a storm.</i>
<i>Oh, there's my daughter.</i>
<i>Let me in.</i>
<i>You know hard and happy
aren't mutually exclusive?</i>
<i>Life can be both.</i>
<i>And mine has been mostly.</i>
<i>But you work so much because of me.</i>
<i>I like my work, and you're worth it.</i>
<i>Katie, I made these choices.</i>
<i>Good or bad, they are not on you.</i>
<i>I'm really scared.</i>
<i>I got you, baby.</i>
<i>I have got you.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>
<i>How's your head, pal?</i>
<i>Yeah, I'll bet.</i>
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>
<i>- This is a bad time.
- No.</i>
<i>- No, I'm sorry.
- No, look, it's not...</i>
<i>it's not...</i>
<i>It's not a bad time. I, uh...</i>
<i>I just...</i>
<i>I just would've preferred pants.</i>
<i>Well, I would stare but
then I'd be missing out</i>
<i>on one of the great smiles of all time.</i>
<i>- See?
- Yeah.</i>
<i>What leg?</i>
<i>Nick, when you meet Katie...</i>
<i>Actually...</i>
<i>I already did.</i>
<i>Oh.</i>
<i>And?</i>
<i>She's got your eyes.</i>
<i>Did you tell her?</i>
<i>You know, there wasn't really
a great segue into, uh...</i>
<i>I'm your dad.</i>
<i>Look, Sarah,
if I'm making things messy for you,</i>
<i>- I have no right...
- No, it's okay.</i>
<i>I do messy pretty well,</i>
<i>and this isn't about me.</i>
<i>I know we discussed
telling her right away,</i>
<i>but I was hoping we could
feel out when it's best.</i>
<i>Together.</i>
<i>She's just kind of got a lot going on.</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, no. Of course, um...</i>
<i>You know what?</i>
<i>I will just be the, um...</i>
<i>very handsome, legless guy upstairs.</i>
<i>- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i>- Hey Nicky.
- Hmm?</i>
<i>Welcome home.</i>
<i>You have an 11:00 meeting
with your lawyer tomorrow.</i>
<i>I don't have a lawyer.</i>
<i>I guess you do now.</i>
