Shouan-san.
Don't worry. We'll be all right if we've made it this far.
Listen, Kotarou. From here on, you have to go by yourself.
Eh?
If you run into trouble during your travels, use this as payment.
What about you?
I need to check whether everyone at the temple is all right.
You must travel to the Mangaku temple at Shirato in Akaike province.
Zekkai-sama at the temple will help you.
But
Never mind me, just go.
Go!
Once we pass over that ridge, we'll be in our province!
(Note: He is interpreting into Chinese.)
The road is bad, so we'll travel on foot from here on.
How's this?!
Yes!
Ah, it's finally my turn!
You'd better hope you don't lose later on!
You're drinking too much. It's only mid-afternoon!
Chief, prey!
Hmm? What's wrong
Fire!
Doshi, Kachuu, get the luggage!
Fire, fire!
Against that many, Rarou-sama alone will be sufficient.
You!
The luggage is safe.
Are the warriors in this country only at that level?
Hey!
God damned mutt, give it back!
Damn it, I'll beat you to death!
Wait!
Tobimaru.
We're having a feast today!
Just wait a moment.
After we eat, let's leave this village.
Okay?
Who are you?!
I'm not a suspicious person or anything.
Get out!
Get out?
Is this...
your house?
That's right. It's our house!
We were here long before you came!
Well then, I'll just be intruding for a while.
Tobimaru, let's go!
Is that the smell of fish?
Tobimaru!
I'm really chilled to the bone.
It should calm down in an hour or so.
If it was just the cold, I could handle it, but serving these Ming...
(Note: The Japanese called the Chinese "Ming," after the Ming dynasty that ruled China from 1368 to 1644.)
I'm also starting to get tired.
What could our lord be thinking, letting strangers into the castle?
Our lord probably has his own plan.
Speaking of strange things, they're building something at the fortress of Shishine.
Oh, you're talking about that monstrous religious altar.
Apparently they surveyed the land, checked the direction, and decided to build it at Shishine.
They told us to use only cedar, and cedar bark for the ropes.
I heard they're really arrogant about giving orders.
What are they doing at such an old fort?
How can we possibly understand what those Ming are thinking?
Smells good.
It's our fish.
Just so you know, we don't have any fish to spare.
You haven't lived here long, have you?
The smoke is proof that the wood is still damp.
You didn't have time to dry it, did you?
It's none of your business!
It's hot, so be careful.
I'm eating it.
Do what you want!
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to the dog.
Yes.
I saw a young kid I'd never seen before.
Was he alone?
If I remember correctly, he had a dog.
When did you see him?
I think it was this morning.
Where?!
Hmm... These days, my memory is really bad.
You have to remember, no matter what!
Despite what you say...
Did you remember?!
No one should be staying at that temple.
Tobimaru, run!
I am a servant of the lord!
There's no point in fighting!
Aren't you being a bit too rough on a kid?
Move!
You... Can't you understand what I'm saying?!
Don't draw your sword.
Nonsense!
Sorry, but I have no intention of getting involved any deeper.
Tobimaru!
Tobimaru!
Tobimaru...
He's been poisoned.
There's nothing an amateur like you can do.
You should see an apothecary.
Where's there an apothecary?!
Ask someone in the village.
If I go back, I'll be taken captive.
Then you should take a horse to a different town.
I can't ride a horse.
Well then, just stay here and do your best to treat him.
Anyway, the dead don't need this anymore.
Are you leaving us here?!
How can I stay in such a dangerous place?
It's your fault!
It's your fault that Tobimaru is dying.
Are you abandoning him, even though he saved your life?!
You ingrate!
I also saved you. We're even.
If you're going to be so temperamental, you shouldn't rely on others.
Wait!
An exchange!
Help Tobimaru, and take us to the Mangaku temple in Shirato, and I'll give you this!
It's worth ten ryou!
(Note: A ryou was a measure of gold, weighing about 16.5 grams.)
Ten ryou?
Yeah, that's right, ten ryou!
It doesn't look cheap.
Of course!
I've never told a lie, or landed on my ass!
Oh!
No closer.
It'd be a problem if you pocketed it and ran away.
If you take us, I'll give it to you.
How about it?
Shirato, huh.
It's a bit far.
Don't you want ten ryou?!
Well...
Don't you want it?
Don't you want it?!
Is Tobimaru okay?
Is the town far?
Answer me! I'm your employer!
The dog's hurting, but he's alive.
The next town is still a ways off.
Go faster!
The horse will get worn out.
Besides, even if there is an apothecary there, we don't know if he'll treat a dog.
Hey, why are you being pursued?
You've employed me, so I have a right to know.
It's your fault if Tobimaru dies!
I won't give you the treasure, and I'll never forgive you!
I'll curse you until death!
What an employer.
He's asking for more workers to speed up the construction.
Understood.
Even though they already paid us 2000 ryou,
they paid the villagers and the construction masons another hundred ryou?
What they're doing doesn't make sense.
They probably have reasons for haste, but they wouldn't tell me when I asked.
It probably has something to do with the kid they're trying to find.
Even so, keeping it a secret like this only makes me want to know more.
True, and because they're servants of the Ming, it's hard for us to reach out to them.
Go bury the saddle somewhere.
It attracts attention because it's got a strange shape.
You should've stolen one of the samurai's horses.
I just chose one that was good-natured.
You go bury it!
After you've buried it, bring the horse and follow me.
If you dawdle, you'll get lost.
Damn it!
I've done what I can, but this is my first time treating a dog.
Tobimaru!
Will he live?
The wound is nothing, but the poison is circulating through him.
In any case, don't move him, and let him drink lots of water. That's probably best.
Water?
It will flush out the poison.
Damn it.
You can't do anything while Tobimaru is paralyzed.
Put Tobimaru on the ground.
Put him down!
Did anyone see the murderer?
Unfortunately...
the man who was with them left to contact us and didn't see a thing.
I see.
What's the meaning of this?
I wonder if it's a festival?
If you're cold, then cover yourself with hay. That should be a bit better.
Thanks for your help.
I got what I wanted, so I don't mind.
Oh, right, right. Beyond this trail, a hot water spring comes out of a cliff.
If you want to, you can take a bath.
I overslept.
How is the dog?
Where are you going?
I'm going into town to get a new saddle.
That's what you say, but maybe you're running off?
If I did that, I'd have been working for free.
Is that him? The monster with the golden hair.
Yeah. Apparently he's a guest and has been going in and out of our lord's castle.
Furthermore, his eyes are blue!
Is that true?!
Yeah.
If we put that blue-eyed guy on display, the money would come pouring in!
Before that, you'd probably get eaten!
Probably.
Is this all right?
Is that from Ooatari?
Some peasants who hunted down a fugitive samurai brought that in.
You don't want a saddle from a ruined province?
Kind of...
The horse won't care.
Kingai and Doshi haven't come back from yesterday's search.
They are both fairly skilled warriors.
I don't think anything would happen to them, but...
In any case, I didn't think we'd have such a hard time capturing a little kid.
Very true. We've only got four days left.
He'll come to the temple sooner or later,
but if we miss the next full moon, we'll have to wait another year.
I'm bored with this country already.
If it's for the Elixir of Immortality, we've got no choice.
The Elixir of Immortality, huh...
I only see it as a stupid joke.
Is the reason you won't use our medicine that you don't believe it works?
The question is different.
The medicine you're using now at least has some effect.
But, when it comes to the Elixir...
I'm not sure about that, but...
Then, why won't you use our effective medicines?
Because it'd be boring.
What's wrong?!
I just feel like playing around a bit.
Why don't you draw?
Is your sword just a decoration?
Rarou-sama!
What's wrong?
Kingai and Doshi have been killed.
And it was just about to become fun.
You're really late.
Is that so?
Weren't you looking for someone to sell me to?
Who the hell would buy a perverse kid like you?
Don't act stupid!
Before, you were very interested in why I was being pursued.
You were probably going around town asking people about me.
Kid, stop your nonsense.
I'm not a kid, I'm Kotarou!
What are you hiding?!
I just had a hard time finding someone to sell me a saddle.
Hmm, such an obvious lie.
What can I do to get you to trust me?
Who can trust someone who works for money?
People who work for money, trip on money!
If you're going to talk so much, do you want to split up here?
In that case, you'll have worked for free till now.
Tobimaru! Tobimaru!
Don't rush. Drink slowly.
The apothecary gave it to me.
Once he's able to drink, apparently he's supposed to take it.
It's extremely bitter, so he probably won't like it, but...
It's time for dinner.
Just wait a bit. I'll give you the medicine.
The sword and clothing belong to Doshi, but it wasn't him.
Doshi has an old wound on his hand that reached his bones.
So there wasn't a scar on the burned corpse's bones?
In addition, there were a few other suspicious points.
Judging from the blood coagulation on the bodies,
Kingai and two of this province's warriors were the first to die.
Kingai died from a single blow to his throat.
Apparently the enemy was quite skilled.
Based on the wounds, the others appear to have died at Doshi's hands.
Kingai's hair had been cut.
I believe Doshi did that to keep it as a memento.
Doshi was attacked by the warriors of this province?
Probably.
Then, where is Doshi?
They've tried to make it look like he's dead, so he's probably alive somewhere.
This has become quite a problem.
I'm sorry.
About before, I'm sorry.
I was angry before.
We were both angry before.
Don't worry about it.
I've got a bit of a short temper.
Next time, don't make me wait.
What was that?
It came from the direction of the guard enclosure.
If I remember correctly, they are looking at a gift the Ming guests brought with them.
I don't like that sound.
There's an ominous smell in the air.
What kind of charm is that?
You've made it so that you can't draw your sword.
Well, it's kind of like a prayer.
What kind of prayer?
It's a secret.
Keeping it to yourself, huh.
All right.
Very good.
You're really nice to horses.
How do you benefit from being nice to your horse?
Lots of ways.
Like making others go and bury the saddle?
You'd understand better if you could ride a horse.
When you ride a horse, you feel great.
When you ride a good horse at top speed...
How should I put it?
Yeah, it feels like you're flying through the sky.
The sky?
Yeah, it doesn't feel bad at all.
A comforting rush of air passes around your body.
And when that happens...
you feel a bit more free than you did before.
Really?
Does it really feel like you're flying through the sky?
You should find out for yourself whether it's true or not.
That's because you loosened your knees.
I'm not the one at fault. This horse is ill-tempered!
What are you talking about?
This horse is really calm.
Look at his groin.
He's been gelded.
That makes his temper more mellow.
So, do you want to stop?
They didn't really look like they were suspicious of us or anything.
Don't let your guard down.
You really are too suspicious.
How's it going?
He is truly stubborn.
No matter what we do, he doesn't even blink.
Oh, really?
Oh! This is unbelievable.
Shougen, what do you think?
Even if our words differ, we're still human.
He can't be completely impervious to pain.
I still can't believe it, even after seeing it with my own two eyes.
Lord, please allow me to continue torturing him.
Hmm, what a reliable man you are.
Itadori Shougen, I'll leave it to you.
Find out why these Ming are here,
and let's barter the information with the Ming Emperor!
Hey, samurai-san, you're up early.
You too, old man.
I thought I'd go into town today.
It would be nice if I could sell this for a high price.
I would really like to raise trees that bear money instead of this.
Are you boiling cow dung?
I'm boiling some nuts.
If I boil them a little longer, the smell will disappear.
Are you trying to knock us out so you can steal the treasure?
Jeez, you sure know how to think like a villain.
They're worth about twenty mon altogether.
(Note: Mon were copper or iron coins.)
Could you possibly add a bit more?
Nope.
If you don't like it, then sell them somewhere else!
What does it say?
The lord is searching for a kid with a companion dog.
If you find them, he'll give you a reward!
A kid with a companion dog...
There are hundreds and thousands of people like that.
Don't think about foolish dreams like that!
Hey.
That outsider, moving around the castle...
I-I give up.
Compared to your archery skills, you have a long way to go.
Next!
Here!
Sorry, my hand slipped from the sweat.
So, how about it?
Just watching isn't enough, right?
Why don't you work out a bit?
Oh, that's right, you don't understand my words.
Well, this is a problem.
I need a wooden sword!
Excuse me...
I wonder if they went out somewhere?
What does it say?
If you want to tough it out, you should at least learn to read and write!
Your back is bent.
I didn't tell you to straighten out that much.
You're too picky.
I have to be picky with slow learners.
If your teaching methods were any good, I'd learn faster!
So many bruises.
What foe was able to hit you so many times?
A person who came from the country of the Ming.
His eyes are blue, and he's six feet tall.
My, he sounds like a demon.
He may be scarier than a demon.
This is the second time I've met someone this good.
The second?
An acquaintance from a long time ago.
He was a comrade when I was serving in Ooatari province.
We both tried to gain fame and fortune through war,
but after a certain victorious battle, he decided to disappear.
He came to dislike war.
So he was a gentle, kind person.
His heart was weak.
In the end, he was a fool, throwing away his gift from heaven.
Well then, how is my husband going to use his gift from heaven?
That's obvious.
I'm going to use it to climb higher and obtain even more power.
You sound as though you're going to take the whole empire.
I don't like having to limit my dreams to my current status.
I'll make my status match my dreams!
Those are amazing scars.
They're from the time I went to war.
Which province did you serve?
It'd be useless to tell you.
It fell and vanished long ago.
So you won't be a soldier again?
Yeah, I'm tired of it.
Oh that's right, you haven't told me your name yet.
Since you were a samurai, I bet you have a great name!
Akage.
(Note: Akage means red hair.)
Hmm? Interesting name.
Akaoni. Nanashi.
(Note: Akaoni means red demon, Nanashi means nameless.)
Hmm? Hey, don't tease me.
I'm not teasing you.
I have no name, so Nanashi.
I changed names whenever I switched provinces.
Bring me that bamboo tube.
It's an extract from the nuts, and it should last about ten days.
Are you a southern barbarian?
Who knows?
Not even I do.
Apparently, I was rescued from a sinking ship, and I was the only survivor.
Some people hated me, but after I learned how to do this, they stopped.
It's a lot easier for me now than when I was a soldier.
What's wrong?
If you stand way over there, you'll catch a cold.
You're awfully quiet.
Are you scared because of my hair color?
I'm not scared. I've seen plenty of foreigners.
It's just...
I was a bit surprised, that's all.
Feels good, doesn't it, mutt?
We were followed.
Act as though you haven't noticed them, and talk about something.
Talk about what?
But have you really seen foreigners loads of times?
Where did you see them?
Tell me about it.
In the country of the Ming.
I was living in Ming until two years ago.
You were living by yourself?
I was with my father and Tobimaru.
Your mother?
She died after giving birth to me.
And your father?
When I was six, he joined my mother.
If you have no parents, how did you get here?
When I was about to be sold as a slave,
a monk who'd been studying in Ming saved me.
And then I went with him on his boat.
When we arrived here, I stayed at one of the temples he was overseeing.
Why did you leave the temple?
The temple was attacked.
Let go! I said, let go!
Are you from Akaike province?
No, no, no! We're not!
We're just... We're just casual thieves!
Just thieves!
Tobimaru, let him go.
Please forgive us! Please forgive us!
Get out of here.
Thank you very much!
Well then...
Just a moment.
Leave all your money here.
We can't. We don't even have a penny.
Please...
Believe us.
If we did, we wouldn't be stealing from others.
What a nice sound.
They were such stupid thieves!
They were really foolish!
I want to make up for the time we lost, but is the dog okay?
Yeah.
If he starts to fall behind, I'll tell you.
Hang on tight, so you won't fall off!
Okay.
You're right. It does feel like we're flying.
Not bad.
Even if it takes many years,
Byakuran, before you have an audience with the Emperor,
the Emperor is really expecting you
to have the Elixir of Immortality in your hands...
Gesshin and Suishin will go to the temple as planned.
When the altar is completed tomorrow, you, Kachuu, will escort me!
The rest should search for the child and prepare to leave this place at once!
The altar has been completed, but the other aspects of the plan are behind schedule!
Truly, I cannot show my face to the Emperor!
We need a backup plan in case the ceremony fails because we can't find the child in time.
If we forgo the full moon in two days' time, the next chance will be a year from now.
By then, a war could occur, this province could fall, and we could lose everything.
Then what?
No one will notice if we postpone the ceremony a few days.
Are you telling me to submit a false report to the Emperor?
I doubt the composition of the blood will change.
Shut your mouth!
Or if we could find a child in Ming, then we could make the altar in our own country.
In Ming, even if we wait a year or two
That's enough!
I will go and check potential exits beforehand.
Idiot!
Even to suggest that we lie to the Emperor!
He may excel at swordsmanship, but in the end, a barbarian's just a barbarian!
Do we have to hand him over, no matter what?
For the sake of our sect, we cannot afford to disobey them!
But, isn't going against the tenets of Buddhism even more
You fool!
Protecting the sect comes first!
Just be happy that you still have your life!
Please, wait!
Get off me!
What's this sound?
From a moment ago, suddenly...
So in the end, you didn't get a reward?
On top of that, the samurai thought I was lying.
He was really angry. I thought I was a goner.
Well, they do say to beware of opportunities that sound too good.
It looks like it will snow tomorrow.
What are you saying? It's so sunny today.
Even though it's cloudy to the west, we can still see Akaike mountain clearly, right?
That means it's gonna snow.
Medicine! Hurry! Give me the medicine quickly!
This is everything.
What is this?
It's one of his possessions.
When the medicine runs out, this is what happens, huh?
Give him peace.
The Elixir of Immortality?
According to the Ming we captured,
they're searching for the ingredients to create a potion for everlasting life.
Everlasting life?
So, it was when a trusted eunuch gave counsel to the Ming Emperor...
...that it all began.
Yes, my lord.
He claimed that, according to a certain Taoist master, it was possible to gain everlasting life.
By using the blood of a prophesied child born only once every hundred years,
it was possible to create the elixir of immortality.
The Emperor believed it and ordered his servants...
...to cross the ocean in search of the child.
The altar at the fortress,
the mechanized clock,
they are all tools to remove the blood, in accordance with the prophecy.
Once in a hundred years?
But, is it true that you can gain everlasting life?
That doesn't matter.
What matters is that the kid can't be bought, even for a ton of gold.
What should we do now?
That goes without saying.
We capture the kid and make those Ming disappear.
But, they're the only ones who know what the kid looks like,
and furthermore, they've been wandering around the province without guidance.
I've already dealt with that.
Furthermore, since they can't understand our language,
they'll come crying to me sooner or later.
Whatever they may want to do, this is still our country.
Are you sad that Rarou isn't around?
You're almost like a wife who's lost her husband.
Don't tease me! I only appear sad because I don't have my hawk.
What a nice excuse.
If we don't catch him by tomorrow,
we'll have to stay here for another year.
Are you worried about the argument with Byakuran yesterday?
A mere trifle.
I'm more worried about the person who killed Kingai.
Really...
It's so like you to be thinking more about a powerful enemy than a direct order from the Emperor.
I will follow the Emperor's order.
Even if they are merely whims of strange Taoist masters and eunuchs.
Right now, the lord's men are watching them,
but starting tomorrow, I will take charge.
I'll make you work hard.
I'm looking forward to it.
Is that the Princess playing?
Don't aim too high.
The best dreams are those that match your own status.
Please wait, Itadori-sama!
Hey.
You're a great swordsman too, right?
What about it?
You should've taught me how to wield a sword, as well as ride a horse.
What's the point in learning?
The point? It'll come in handy for surviving.
You can really depend on the power of a sword!
Depend on it, huh.
When I was a kid, I used to think so as well.
You don't think that way anymore?
You were moaning a lot.
Were you awake?
I couldn't possibly sleep with that.
Really...
Hey, do you want me to tell you how to avoid bad dreams?
It helps to think about good times, while touching something that's dear to you.
I always do that.
Byakuran-sama.
Are you not going to rest?
I was just thinking for a bit.
Fuugo,
if you could live forever, what would you do?
Who knows?
I'd be happy if I could live strongly, even if just for a short time.
Ah, youth.
I've lived for a very long time.
I've reached an age where I could die at any moment.
But, strangely, the longer I live, the more I want to live even longer.
I have been searching for the elixir for a long time, based on the Emperor's order.
But I may also have been searching for it in the hope that I could use it myself.
I never knew that the Mangaku temple in Shirato was so big.
Here is the item I pledged.
You know,
back then, I was really excited and said it was worth ten ryou,
but...
I thought so.
It's so like you to do that.
Well, its approximate value should be five ryou.
Uh, no...
O-One ryou?
It's not that bad as a fee, is it?
I'm sure you'll get some good karma!
You're really an amazing kid.
I'm not a kid!
Ko
Kotarou?
Kotarou...
Shouan-san.
Shouan-san!
You're all right, Shouan-san.
I was really worried.
I too am relieved that you're unharmed.
I'm happy.
I thought that if I got here, I could meet you.
I...
Well then, I'll take you to Zekkai-sama.
Nanashi!
See you, kid!
If you ever want a name, come to me!
I'll think of a great name for you!
Shouan-san?
You really are late.
Zekkai-sama?
I've grown tired of waiting. Finally we meet.
Let me go, you! Let me go! I told you to let me go!
You tricked me, you bastard!
You sold me out!
Damn it!
Don't kill him.
It will be easier to carry him if he's quiet.
Let's hurry.
They're here.
Don't use your bows.
Let's go!
I'll go.
Call for reinforcements! We must inform Itadori-sama!
Damn you!
Well then, where should we go?
Whoa!
Hurry!
Who... Who are you?!
Where did they take the boy?!
No! Don't tell him
Answer me. Answer me!
Tonight...
Tonight at midnight, they're going to kill him and drain his blood.
What for?
I don't know.
Where?
I don't know... I don't know!
They didn't trust us.
They casually kill those they don't value.
You knew he was going to be killed, and you handed him over anyway?
I wanted to save him!
Zekkai-sama made the decision, not me!
In the end, you abandoned him!
Yes...
You're right.
I abandoned him, just like you said.
They intimidated me, and I abandoned him in fear of my life.
But, if you were in my place,
you'd do the same thing!
Am I wrong?
No one can follow his own ideals, at the cost of disobeying his superiors!
No one can! Am I right?
Could you do it?
You act all high and mighty, but will you go to save that child?!
If you go, you'll just be throwing your life away, so you won't go!
You're...
In the end,
you're the same as me!
Someone who is even lower than a dog doesn't need a monk's sash.
What are the colors on the cloth?
Yellow and red.
Ah, they've made it!
Yellow is the sign that they've captured the child.
And red?
The sign that the people of this castle have betrayed us!
Quick, call Rarou!
Please wait!
Please!
Please wait!
What is your business here?!
I don't care. Let them through!
As I thought, they've come back crying.
Now, why have you come here?
Go to the front gate.
Where are the Ming?
Find them!
Why did you attack them without my authorization?
The orders from our lord were to grab the child quickly!
I am the one in charge!
Where is the child?
He doesn't know.
We've got an idea of where he is.
Most likely at the fortress of Shishine.
What should we do with this monk?
He's a traitor who sided with the Ming. Send him to the other world.
Yes.
What about that one?
He was a follower of the monk.
He killed himself while the other was unconscious.
I see. Let's return to the castle for now.
The rest of you, stay here and wait for my next order.
An urgent report!
An urgent report!
Our lord?!
We were off-guard because they were unarmed, but they still cut through us!
What about Isogai-dono and Fuchinume-dono?
Unfortunately...
You stood there and watched as our lord was taken?
They threatened to kill me. I couldn't do anything!
Why didn't you go after them?
They poisoned all the horses!
The only ones left are the baggage carriers!
I've sent the Wataoki and Kawashi armies after them,
but on foot, they probably won't arrive until nightfall!
You sent the Wataoki and Kawashi armies?
Yes.
Right now, Itadori-sama is the only leader left!
The Princess has ordered us to follow your orders!
I did my best to carry out her wishes, but...
Juurouta, prepare horses and armor.
For you and me.
Understood.
We're changing plans!
All of you head for the castle!
Juurouta and I will go to the fortress of Shishine!
While we're buying time, you,
Byakuran-dono, will leave this country.
He sure gave us a lot of trouble.
We only have to hold out for a bit longer.
If we get through this, we can say goodbye to this country.
You're right. We can finally go home.
That's yours, right?
A guy who was trying to follow us at the Mangaku temple had it.
What happened to him?
He wasn't so weak that he'd fall at your hands.
I sent him to the other world with this.
Don't bite me, even if these tracks aren't your master's!
Are you scared?
Pretending you don't understand? Or are you too scared to speak?
People eventually die.
No one has infinite time.
You should live what little time you have left to the fullest.
If you're going to kill me, do it quickly!
Don't fret. I want to ask you something.
When you were being taken from the temple, a man tried to help you.
Is he your friend?
I have no idea.
Tell me truthfully.
I have no friends!
It seems you have no intention of telling me.
Well, no matter. An ally of mine killed that man.
Juurouta! You know these roads, don't you?
There's a shortcut, but I'm not sure if the horses can make it.
I don't care if we ride them out.
Hurry!
Do you see it?
When this needle points to the heavens, your soul will leave your body,
and it will be embodied inside the Emperor through your blood.
Is it not a great honor?
Are you worried?
No.
Don't be.
Shougen may be a former masterless samurai,
but our lord trusts him fully, and he's said to be very loyal.
He'll definitely save our lord.
Can we do it?
The Wataoki and Kawashi armies were all trained by Itadori-sama, like me.
There won't be a problem.
I'm counting on you!
Leave it to me!
Juurouta!
It's Juurouta!
Look, Itadori-sama is with him as well!
Itadori-sama! We've been waiting for you!
What should we do?
Use their lord as a shield, and buy us some time!
We're only a moment away from the ceremony.
Is-Is that our lord?
How shameful.
Shougen!
Is that Shougen there?!
We can't do anything like this!
What is Itadori-sama going to do?
Juurouta!
Shouge
Don't despair!
Listen up! I'm going to make you choose sides clearly!
Will you follow me? Or will you follow your dead lord?!
If you follow me, you can have any reward you want!
Damn you!
I will follow Itadori-sama!
What will you do?!
I will also follow Itadori-sama!
M-Me too!
I will also follow Itadori-sama!
Me too!
Me too!
We will now subdue the fortress of Shishine!
Wh-What?
Unlike our Emperor,
a ruler is merely a leader for these warriors.
Apparently he wasn't a good candidate for a hostage.
So this is the warrior's reality...
Let Kachuu take over the ceremony!
We'll go down and drive them back!
<i>Fire!</i>
Damn it.
Damn it.
Back!
Forward!
Forward!
I'll go on ahead.
Charge!
Itadori-sama! If I can sever their necks,
I, Juurouta, have a wish!
The Princess is already yours!
Gotcha!
Damn you!
Take that!
Arrows!
Aim properly!
Break into two squads!
Don't falter!
Now's our chance!
While they're blind-sided, charge in!
Stand back!
You guys go and fight someone else.
This one is my prey!
Don't be foolish.
I was originally a spear carrier. It won't go like last time!
I'm enough for all of you!
I can't understand you at all.
It's a foolish emotion.
This is the way of the world now.
Our lord killed the previous lord and came to power.
And it's all thanks to your hard work.
Really, I am truly envious.
Hurry and kill me, you coward!
It's time.
Tobimaru!
Kotarou!
That guy...
Move!
Move!
Tobimaru!
What's wrong? What's wrong?!
I don't feel a thing!
Try thrusting that sword into my heart!
Well!
Hurry and go back! Kachuu was killed!
I eliminated the rest.
Tobimaru!
Let's go.
Someone interrupted the ceremony!
The time has already passed. What do you want us to do?
There's no question! We'll take the child, and whether it takes ten years, or a hundred, we'll wait!
Leave it to us!
Really...
This is going to cost you big time.
As I thought.
I heard you! You called me, right?
Damn it, you're late!
I told you I'm short-tempered.
You made me wait.
Come on, let's go. Don't dawdle.
I know.
I wasn't talking to you.
I was talking to Tobimaru.
Stay back!
Nanashi!
My sword.
My sword...
Nanashi!
Rarou-sama...
My sword...
Rarou-sama...
Killing both Suishin and Fuugo...
He's quite a man.
Rarou!
You're in the way, move!
Damn it.
This is where you die!
You...
Have you gone crazy?!
I am perfectly lucid.
Now I feel that it was good that I came to this country.
I've finally met someone who's worth fighting.
I thank you for bringing me here.
You...
rotten warrior!
Rarou!
You want to trick the Emperor and gain immortality for yourself.
You selfish...
Immortality is wasted on someone with as little loyalty as you.
Those who deserve immortality are people like me with many loyal
You've lived long enough, don't you think?
What happened?
The foreigner killed his allies.
There's only one of them left!
We've met before.
Nanashi!
Use this...
Use...
medicine.
Take away...
pain.
I don't need it.
Pain makes me feel like I'm more alive.
Great...
Really great.
I'm starting to like you even more...
Nanashi!
This is the first time I've been wounded, but...
the pain from a sword...
feels... strange...
Strange...
It feels strange...
You've become pretty good.
It feels... like I'm walking on top of the clouds.
Don't flatter me.
Are your wounds all right?
Yeah... even a treasure like this comes in handy sometimes.
Right?
Really...
You're some employer.
Can you see the town?
I can't see it yet.
But, I'm sure it's close!
Hey...
Huh?
Once your wounds heal, do you want to leave this country?
If we go abroad, people there wouldn't mind your hair color, right?
A foreign land, huh.
That's not a bad idea. But how would we make money?
We could steal, or become bodyguards. We can do anything!
In fact, we could even become pirates!
You're...
really full of villainous ideas.
Hold on tight, so you won't fall off!
Yeah.
Let's go!
