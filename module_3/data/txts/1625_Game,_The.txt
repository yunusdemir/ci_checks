I have information
about a major KGB operation.
It has been named Operation Glass.
Who's the first agent?
- David Hexton.
David, this is an opportunity to be a hero.
This isn't a conventional war, Jim.
Do the Soviets want to oppress us?
Without question.
How are you given the names?
- A dead-letter drop.
In men's toilets.
They put adverts in classified ads.
They say, 'Cousin Andrew, please visit us.'
If Moscow know he's working for us, it'll
be a trap. They'll be waiting for him.
Daddy, we need a decision.
We assume Moscow don't know about Arkady.
We let Arkady collect the next name.
We endanger the few to protect the many.
It could be a trap.
What if they are waiting for me?
What if they shoot me?
And that's why I'm here.
Then I can arrest them.
What?
I'll take up position.
Wait five minutes, then head for the drop.
What happened?
- Sex. He wanted sex, Joe.
I can always come back later.
Yeah, this time he was no one.
Every conversation we have...
Every name I give you...
We'll protect you.
Is that what you told David Hexton?
I told him it was his chance
to be a soldier, to be a hero.
My father fought in Stalingrad.
He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.
That was a war that made heroes, not this.
Would our fathers be proud of us, Joe?
I don't know, my father's dead.
Remember what you said.
If Operation Glass is successful,
it changes everything.
All the horrors you've seen in your own
country, they'll bring those here.
I don't care about any of that.
And I don't think you do either.
We join the game for different reasons.
Whether you stay loyal or you betray
everything, only you know why.
So, whatever made you join us
in the first place,
just remember that.
Come on.
Vertaling Désirée.
I'm worried about Daddy.
One more cock up, he'll
be getting his clock,
which will be heart-breaking,
blah-blah, but may be a blessing.
I mean... The business
with the Chinese dancer?
Someone has to mind the shop,
the old man is losing his...
As requested, all meetings are
recorded for your reference.
We must have caught this conversation by
accident before the tape was stopped.
Has anyone else heard this?
I brought it straight to you.
Bobby Waterhouse.
He really is the limit.
I'm sorry, but I make no
apology for my language.
Bobby is who Bobby is.
Thank you, Alan, for bringing
this to my attention.
We will say no more about it.
See you on the green.
What's your name?
- Tom.
I'm Alice.
We're gonna be friends, aren't we?
We're getting ahead of ourselves.
Who is this man?
- Thomas Mallory.
Graduated from the Royal Naval College '44,
six years on HMS Pioneer, seven on
HMS Eagle, rising to Lieutenant,
desk job at the MOD ever since.
- And the message Arkady is to give him?
Arkady has deciphered his
instructions with his one-time pad.
He is to greet Tom
and hand over the message.
It's merely a name and a phone number.
Valerie Parkwood. 019464980.
Who is Valerie Parkwood?
She's secretary
to the Prime Minister, Daddy.
Good God.
You don't think she's got snow
on her boots, too?
Anyone with that level of access would have been
thoroughly vetted, but we can't rule it out.
It could be that Mallory's
task was to reactivate her.
Then, why not have
Arkady contact her directly?
Information about Operation Glass is released on
a need to know basis, why involve someone else?
We'll monitor Tom Mallory from
the moment of reactivation,
follow him to Valerie Parkwood
and see what they're cooking up.
But that brings us back to our problem.
Tom Mallory is in police custody.
He was arrested last night
for beating up a prostitute.
Now, this is something of a habit with him.
But the last three times he's wangled
an acquittal, or it never got to court.
On this occasion however, the victim
is determined to press charges.
Sarah, I want you running things.
Use Joe for all face-to-face.
Sarah? But I was rather hoping...
Alan, we need to put ears in Valerie
Parkwood's flat and on her work telephone.
Whitehall get rather touchy
about us tapping their phones.
I'll talk to the Cabinet Secretary.
Joe, return this to Arkady, let
him reactivate Tom Mallory.
Bobby, call the Police Commissioner,
get Mallory released on bail.
He can't teach us much about Operation
Glass from inside a police cell.
This is our chance to make amends
for what happened to David Hexton.
No one else is going to die today.
Daddy, sorry, quick word.
I'm a little piqued, truth be told.
I'm the most senior Cub Scout here,
but you're giving Sarah the keys to the hut.
People are talking, Bobby.
They say 'Old Waterhouse,
he's a confirmed bachelor'.
And then they wink and they snigger. And I'm
sure I've even seen a nudge in the past.
Do you know what I take that to mean?
I can't imagine.
Work can only ever be a mistress, Bobby.
Mistresses are ravenous.
But a wife puts the world in perspective.
Makes a fellow rounded.
I bet your mother is desperate
for grandchildren.
You've met my mother, haven't you?
- Asking you to be selfless is futile,
only an enforced separation will suffice.
I want you to take a more
observational role.
Giving you space to find yourself
and perhaps, someone else?
But, Daddy, my duty is to the job, to you.
Be assured, I know exactly
where your loyalties lie.
Very good, Daddy.
Mr Mallory, I bring greetings
from your aunt in Somerset.
What?
I don't have an aunt in...
My aunt...
Well, well, well.
How is the old girl?
Arkady has reactivated Tom Mallory.
We'll wait for him to make contact with
Valerie Parkwood and see where that leads us.
I'll speak to the prostitute,
get her to drop the charges.
The last thing we need is a pending court case
when we're trying to keep him under surveillance.
What?
You.
You're you again.
The agent that was killed in Poland, the man
who killed her is part of Operation Glass.
He's the man that killed David Hexton.
His codename's Odin.
You've known about this since
David Hexton died? Christ, Joe.
This is a major conflict of interest.
You don't think you should have told us?
How is there a conflict?
- How?
We're engaged in a delicate, volatile
operation and you're pursuing a vendetta.
It's the same objective. Find Odin, expose Glass.
Expose Glass, find Odin.
They may be the same objective now,
but what if suddenly it's not?
How do I know you'll do your job
instead of pursuing some
ridiculous quest for vengeance?
Sarah, please.
Now, let me do this.
I told her I'd look after her.
What's that?
It's chalk.
What does it do?
- 'What does it do?'
It's chalk.
What does chalk do in Russia?
It's not secret spy chalk?
- I don't think so.
I bought it at WHSmith.
This is how we're going to communicate.
This...
This says there's a message
in the dead-letter drop.
Under the last bench, the
last pew of St John's Church.
Right.
If you've left a message
there, you draw a line here.
If you've picked up that message or if
I have, you draw another line here.
What will the messages be?
- I don't know. It could be anything.
What if you just want to say hello?
Yeah, we don't usually...
any messages...
What if I want to recommend a book?
I promise, I only use for really good books.
Yulia, this is serious.
I know this is serious.
But you can smile.
You are allowed to enjoy things.
One more signal.
What's that?
- Danger.
This means you're in danger.
Alice?
Sorry to bother you. My name is Tim Dawson.
I work for the government.
I'd like to talk to you about
the man who assaulted you.
Wondered when you'd show up.
It would be very beneficial to us
if you could drop the charges against him.
I can't give you the details why,
but we need to keep him under surveillance.
No.
That isn't to say you wouldn't be
compensated for what you've suffered.
I'd like to give you £150...
- I was thinking about it afterwards,
I was thinking, 'It won't be easy, Alice.
'He's posh, they won't like it.'
And here you are.
- He's part of a process.
It is for the good of the country he
remains at liberty, so we can monitor him.
It's nothing to do with class.
- Of course it is.
Everything is.
If I carry on...
If I press charges, what will happen?
To me.
Would you lock me up?
- Steps would have to be taken.
For the good of the country, you say.
Just who are you protecting?
'Cause you ain't protecting me.
The top copy goes to the Cabinet Secretary,
the bottom copy goes to me.
Why does this very simple
concept continue to elude you?
Valerie Parkwood.
- Valerie, it's Tom. Tom Mallory.
Tom?
Goodness, it's been a while.
Yes, sorry about that. Something...
Something came up, all very hush-hush.
You know how it is.
But a day didn't go by that I...
I didn't think of you.
And...
I was wondering if we might
get reacquainted.
In fact, looking at the old diary, I...
Yes. I'm free this evening.
I could pop over.
7:00 all right?
I suppose I could move a few things around.
That's lovely.
Listen, must dash. Tta.
Do you want a sandwich?
Sarah's gone slightly
overboard on the provisions.
I think it's her way of saying
you look undernourished.
Dear.
We're trying to get pregnant,
so I'm insisting she eats lots
of oily fish, which she loathes.
Corned beef. I can't stand the stuff.
That's revenge.
Remarkable woman.
Curtain up.
Hello.
Sit down.
One of the duties of each new Prime Minister
is to write a letter of last resort.
It states his decision about whether to
retaliate in the event of a nuclear strike.
You typed that letter for him, Valerie.
You know what it says.
Now you're going to tell me.
- How can you ask such a thing?
This is treason, Tom.
Valerie, Valerie,
ours is not to reason why...
No, Tom.
This will not do. Get out.
Get out of my flat this minute.
And here was me thinking
you were the decent sort.
Now what do we do?
Joe.
Let's try that again, shall we, Valerie?
What is in the Letter of Last Resort?
We have to stop this, we can't
let him access that information.
We'll lose our advantage.
He'll know we're onto him.
She's resisting him, she's
not telling him anything.
It said...
I was really surprised by this.
It said...
'Piss off, Tom.'
I had a feeling you'd be like this.
Luckily I came prepared.
Take a seat.
Your nephews, Mark and Adam, yes?
You see, Valerie, I will do
terrible things to Mark and Adam,
unless I find out what's in that letter.
Stop. Please, stop.
Stop. Stop, please.
Valerie, my name's Joe.
I work for MI5.
I told him. God.
He threatened my nephews
so I told him everything.
No. Please...
I thought my work would be a privilege.
I thought I would spend
my days in the company of
gallant and charming men.
But instead we shovel shit.
And when we get home,
our clothes are stiff with
blood and sweat and grease.
I miss the war.
The other one.
A chap knew where he stood.
Why on earth didn't we have
someone stationed outside?
For all we knew it was just
a standard reactivation.
There was nothing to make us think...
So, where is he now?
We don't know. We've searched
his house, there's nothing.
Let's not panic just yet.
- What's in the letter?
If the Prime Minister says we'll retaliate,
the stalemate remains intact,
it doesn't matter if they know.
Valerie said it's 'no'.
No strike back.
No retaliation.
So this is it?
My God.
Operation Glass is a pre-emptive
nuclear strike on the UK.
Sorry, can we just go back a bit?
The Prime Minster said 'no'?
That if they attack us, we won't fight back?
Are you serious?
Right, so we're completely vulnerable.
Everything you, the whole
bloody Cold War, everything,
it's nothing, it's bluff.
Which is why that information
cannot be allowed to reach Moscow.
Mallory's only point of contact with Moscow is
Arkady, so for the time being, it's contained.
But Arkady wasn't recruiting
Tom, he was reactivating him.
He must have been working
with someone before.
He could have contacts, handlers, safe
houses, an entire network from back then.
Bobby's right, we need to move
on this quickly. Tonight.
If Tom's already passed the information to Moscow,
they could be preparing an attack as we speak.
Bobby, I want you monitoring
the situation overnight.
Open lines with 6, the FO, the MOD.
The Red Army start amassing on borders,
residents start packing, I want to know.
If you think I'm up to it.
- I could help. I mean, I don't mind.
Extra pair of hands and all that.
What do we do about Tom?
Until we hear otherwise, we assume he's still
in the country. We find him, question him.
The time to protect our advantage is past, we need
to get him and that intel out of circulation.
Interview the prostitute again. Perhaps
Tom mentioned somewhere he was going.
Speak to her, Joe. Tell her
what she needs to hear.
Thank you, everyone.
Daddy, Bobby, can I have a quick word?
Even if we find Tom before
he hands over the intel,
even if we put him in prison, such a
simple piece of information to pass on.
I wouldn't be doing my job if I don't suggest
we prepare a couple of contingency plans.
Agreed.
But I need to know how absolute
you want these plans to be.
Tom Mallory cannot be
allowed to contact Moscow.
Your list of options
should be comprehensive.
Brief Joe accordingly.
I want him prepared, in every sense.
The man who assaulted you has gone missing.
Did he talk about someone?
Did he mention any trips he had planned?
If you still want to press charges,
we would now be in a position to help you.
If we could locate him, entice him here,
then we could...
- You'd bring him here?
He wouldn't expect us to be here,
then we could arrest him.
He left this.
It's a private club on Piccadilly.
Just a posh strip club really, but he
wouldn't have this unless he was a member.
Alice, this is great, thank you.
But I've got one more favour to ask.
Go to the club,
tell them you've been
contacted by two Russians.
They want the information that
he got from Valerie Parkwood.
They'll meet him here
tonight, at 11:00.
I'm looking for one of your
members, he's Tom Mallory.
Yeah, lovely.
- Can you make sure he gets it?
I'll make sure he gets it. No problem.
- Thanks.
Soviet tanks are carrying out
manoeuvres along the Finnish border.
This is a monthly event, so
probably nothing to worry about.
And the embassy residents?
We've placed all but five,
but the outstanding ones are low level,
so not the sort to be smuggled out
first as a matter of priority.
Should we tell them?
It feels wrong,
us knowing what's about
to happen and not them.
No. I know it's hard,
but we can't.
Daddy's just promoted me, so it would be absolutely
rotten luck if it was the end of the world.
Daddy's promoted you?
- I'm assistant to his permanent secretary.
No, hang on, that's
a political thing, isn't it?
I'm assistant to his permanent sec...
I said it again.
When did this happen?
- Yesterday.
I'm just mucking in
while Joyce has her baby.
I'm not sure I'll even get a rise, but just
some luncheon vouchers, but I'm jolly thrilled.
Least surprising thing I've heard all day.
But if this is close of play,
should I call anyone?
I wouldn't tell them anything, obviously.
I just want to hear their voices.
My little brother, my nana.
I'm sure they'd be very
happy to hear from you.
Hello.
- Mother Goose, Bobbington Bob.
Where are you? Your bovine cleaner knocked
the aerial pushing a j-cloth around.
I swear, I've never seen
a more torpid individual.
She makes Eisenhower's corpse look
like something out of Calcutta.
Daddy asked me to stay behind.
'Something's going down' as...
the cousins say.
Absolute top level stuff.
And he asked for you?
Interesting.
Says he couldn't trust anyone else.
Anyway, look, I just wanted to say...
I know we have our ups and downs,
but I really am jolly fond of you.
Are you drunk?
And we make a good team, don't we,
you, you silly package?
Are you dying?
Christ, am I dying?
Good God, woman, I just wanted to
talk to you, tell you how I felt.
Well don't. We're not Spanish.
Now, get off the line.
Clarissa Mountview has just discovered
her husband's screwing a dental nurse,
and if she can't get through to me,
someone else will get all the details.
In the event of a nuclear attack,
control of all television
channels and radio stations
will be given to the British
Wartime Broadcasting Service.
If an attack is imminent, you will
hear the attack sound like this...
If you are at home when
you hear the warning signal,
send any children to
the fallout room immediately.
Because of the threat of radiation,
you and your family may need to live
in the fallout room for
14 days after an attack.
So, you must make it as safe as you can
and equip it for your survival.
If you are at work or elsewhere and cannot
reach home within a couple of minutes,
take cover in any nearby building.
If a death occurs while you're
confined to the fallout room,
place the body in another room
and cover it as securely as possible.
Attach identification.
Hello? How may I help you?
- I need to speak to Henderson.
That's Mr Henderson.
- Hold on a minute, please.
Listen to me, it's urgent.
I must talk to him
about the shoes he ordered.
It's ready a day early.
He must come to collect it.
And what does that mean?
An emergency meeting to be held
an hour after the contact.
Joe is at the... The place where
they're hoping to meet Tom Mallory.
We'll go ourselves.
What? We can't do that. He's a protected source.
He's Joe's agent.
This is no time for protocol.
Arkady could be telling us
that the comrades are about to
rain hellfire down on London.
Besides, I want Joe interrogating Tom Mallory.
Where's their rendezvous?
First, the Olympic Hotel. Fall back, the
bar underneath the Phoenix Theatre.
Wait. You're head
of counter-espionage.
He can't see your face.
It's for your own protection.
He's here.
Mr Gibson, we spoke on the telephone.
Please come in.
It's an honour to meet you.
Where's Henderson?
I assure you I have been authorised
to have this conversation.
Not by me.
I talk only to Henderson.
This was agreed.
Who is in there?
Mr Gibson.
Mr Gibson, you can trust me.
We're very concerned about the information
Tom Mallory has acquired. Please.
This is so important, it's so terrifying.
Moscow want to meet Tom tomorrow morning. Grand
Union Canal under the Westway at 6:00 a.m.
If Moscow are still passing
messages to Tom through Arkady,
that would suggest they don't
know where he is either.
And that they don't have the intel.
- Good,
but we still need to decide what to do with him
when he turns up here. If he turns up here.
We'll question him. Find out
everything he knows about Glass.
Then what? He still has the intel,
we can't let him out of our sight.
Throw him in prison or throw
him in the Thames, I say.
Either way Moscow will know that we're
onto them, we lose our advantage.
Better that than them finding
out we've got our knickers
permanently round our ankles.
Come along, Wendy.
What did you tell Alice?
She might ask me.
We need to be consistent.
I told her we'd help her press charges.
What will you say when
she realises we can't?
I don't know. Lie to her.
I've gotten pretty good at that.
Sarah, Joe, he's here,
he's at the end of the street.
Alice, he's here.
Right, me and Jim
will go downstairs with you.
Just open the door, tell him the Russian
gentlemen have arrived, get him inside.
No, he might see you.
Stay here, I'll bring him up.
Sorry, go on.
Are they here?
- Wait.
I want you to look me in the eye.
Was there a knife on that plate?
Jesus.
Come on.
Get up against the wall.
- I haven't done anything.
Shut up.
- Get him upstairs.
Give me that.
You all right?
What happens next as this country
faces its worst industrial crisis
since the General Strike of 1926?
In panorama, some of the striking miners...
Some of those whose job it is to run Britain's
industry and the government and opposition...
Excellent, marvellous news.
What comfort can you offer the
people of this country tonight?
How serious...
Wendy? It's, Bobby. Are you decent?
I thought we should celebrate.
Joe and Sarah have managed to locate
Tom Mallory and you've been promoted.
Deserves a glass of sherry, don't you think?
I was just about to, to turn in...
- Excellent...
So, assistant to Daddy's
permanent secretary?
Unfettered access to the great man.
Yes, I'm sure I'll learn heaps.
- And quite an achievement,
considering you've only been
here, what, six months?
Four years.
- Four years. Is it? Good heavens. Four...
I'm just going to pop
that there for a moment.
Yes, apologies for the digs.
Just because we're fighting the Soviets,
I don't see why we should have to pay
homage to their interior design as well.
Actually, I rather like it,
which is why I volunteered to stay.
The flat where I live is pretty ghastly.
The landlord lives upstairs and he has
this huge dog and he practises flamenco...
The landlord, not the dog.
And when I talk to him he stares at my...
my blouse,
and I have to share the bathroom with
an Indian family who are very sweet,
but goodness, they do love a sing-song.
I'm going to give your knee
a jolly good squeeze now.
Right you are.
Goodness.
That was, thorough.
Sarah's jolly clever, isn't she?
No, I... No, I'm sorry.
I have to call a halt.
Am I doing something wrong?
- No, but, yes.
Is this part of the process?
Is this what I'm expected
to do? Am I a perk?
What? No. This isn't about... No...
No, this is not something like that.
I just thought it would be pleasant.
No, no, it would, but it's awkward.
Work.
This would cost you nothing.
But for me...
You can't court your boss and
expect people to respect you.
So, we have to choose. At least I do.
And I choose work.
You're ambitious.
- That's not a crime.
No.
No, it certainly is not.
Let me make amends. Now, you're
having trouble with your flat.
There's a room going in my house.
It's just me and the mother ship there,
rattling around and she's a
sweet, gentle, old soul.
That's very kind, but doesn't it
leave us with the same problem?
A single chap and a single
girl lodging together...
People will talk.
I'm sure they won't.
So...
This is what we know, Tom.
You've been spying for the Soviet Union,
and through violence and
coercion you managed to obtain
the contents of the Letter of Last
Resort from Valerie Parkwood.
Now, that right there is life in prison.
People in prison for treason, they
exist outside of the legal system.
It's endless.
It's maddening.
You'll wish you'd never been born.
You'd be amazed at the rumours that
start up about prisoners in solitary.
That they killed their own
children and molested the bodies.
How fast can you run?
Tom, is the Soviet Union planning
a pre-emptive nuclear strike?
Or is the Letter of Last Resort
part of a bigger operation then?
Do you like it rough, dear?
- Yes, Tom.
The rougher the better.
How will Moscow use
the contents of that letter?
You look the sort.
I bet we'd have an absolute scream.
I'm happily married, thank you, but it's
nice to know one can still turn heads.
Answer the question.
Do you know what the comrades have
promised me for helping them?
A statue in Gorky Park,
a national holiday in my name,
and a procession of pliant,
yet motherless girls
who bruise easily, but don't fight back.
All that's null and void
if I cooperate with you.
Jim, can you step in a moment?
Give me your belt.
What are you doing?
- That light fitting's not strong enough,
but there's a decent drop from the banisters,
so we'll use the stairwell.
What are you doing?
The official version will be that
you came here to plead with Alice
to drop the charges, she refused and fled.
You couldn't deal with the inevitable disgrace,
so you decided to take your own life.
Jim, will you get his legs?
Get his legs.
- No.
Christ.
No, stop. Christ, stop.
All right. I'll talk.
Get in the chair.
Shall we start again?
Who have you told about
the Letter of Last Resort?
No one.
Before you were approached the other day, when was
the last time you had any contact with Moscow?
About a year ago.
- Why so long?
They were putting a lot of
their UK networks on ice.
They had an idea they said, for something.
But they needed to get certain
things in place first.
I don't know, people, I think.
Who told you this?
- It was a phone call.
Someone I hadn't dealt with before.
He told me to imagine
a constellation of stars.
The axis had to shift slightly
and stars had to belined up in a certain way
before they could proceed.
What was his name?
They don't trade in real names
any more than you do.
He told me he was called Odin.
The Letter of Last Resort.
Is that the endgame?
- I don't know.
I mean, I really... I don't know.
They haven't told me.
The information you were given was
just a name and a telephone number.
If you'd had no contact with Moscow,
how did you know what to do?
The last task they gave me,
before it went quiet,
was to get the Letter of
Last Resort from Valerie.
I sought her out, I screwed her,
they told me to stand down.
How did they recruit you?
- They said Britain didn't appreciate me.
Said warming a seat at the MOD was a
criminal waste of my skills and intellect.
So, this isn't about an
ideology, this is about
recognition.
I won't get so much as
a bloody MBE from you lot.
Christ, they give those
to lollypop ladies now.
So, if we made you a better offer,
you'd consider coming back on side?
What?
- What?
What?
- What?
Not threatening to kill me would be a start.
Come and work for us and you'd be
surprised how generous we can be.
Jim, will you pop in for a moment?
In return all you have to do
is meet with the Soviets
and gather intelligence on the
wider operation and on Odin.
Step outside.
Now.
He can't contact the Soviets. He'll tell them
about the letter, they'll attack straight away.
Arkady said the history of counter intelligence will
be split into before and after Operation Glass.
That to me suggests a sequence of events,
not just bombs flattening London.
Then why did they want the Letter of Last Resort?
- Wouldn't we, if they had an equivalent?
It's just a fail-safe in case
the wider operation goes wrong.
They went to a hell of a lot of trouble for a
fail-safe. Christ, I said this would happen,
you are putting your personal
agenda ahead of the mission.
It has nothing to do with...
If we arrest him, if we silence him,
throw him in prison, Moscow
will know that we're onto them.
They'll retreat into the shadows,
the operation will still go ahead as planned but
it'll be too late for us to know anything about it.
Tom will be wired, we'll
have shadows on him, okay?
We won't let him out of our sight.
Please, Sarah...
Let me do this.
He can lead us to the heart of it,
then he can lead me to Odin.
And if you're wrong?
If he tries to escape?
Then I know what I have to do.
The bridge is covered.
I just need to test the levels.
Could you say something?
You have egg on your tie.
I'm in position. Over.
Right, it's time.
Whatever it said in that letter, you tell them
that the plan is that the UK would retaliate.
Joe, make sure it's pointed at Mr Mallory.
All right.
I think he's spotted someone.
Okay, curtain up.
All units stand by.
They know everything.
Shit.
Jim, watch the door.
You, check there's no other way out.
Don't come inside.
Joe?
I've got a family.
You can't trust him.
Do what you have to do.
Please.
I'm unarmed.
- Turn around.
Please, you're better than this.
Apparently not.
Close your eyes.
I've met Odin.
I met him. Last year.
I can tell you everything you need to know.
What's his real name?
Why is he here?
Come on, let's not rush things.
I tell you all that,
you won't need me any more.
No, let's think of this as the
beginning of our relationship.
How can I trust you?
Double-crossing you was a
mistake, I can see that now.
But we're starting again.
Next time I'll lead you
right to the man himself.
And the Letter of Last Resort?
Don't worry about that,
my lips are sealed, scout's honour.
You've got a thing going
with Odin, haven't you?
I bet there's a woman involved somewhere.
Don't worry, I won't pry.
But what do you say?
You scratch my back?
It'll be our little secret.
That's the ticket.
You've got a thing going
with Odin, haven't you?
I bet there's a woman involved somewhere.
Kate Wilkinson, 36, unmarried,
no living relatives.
Arkady's message meant something to Kate.
It triggered a new stage in the operation.
What makes a girl like that turn on her country?
She's so normal looking.
If we don't secure her tonight, it's over.
- She's doing a runner.
Turn her double agent, Joe.
Talk to her, charm her,
whatever it is you do to them.
Vertaling Désirée.
