<i>Fashion inJuries have no respect for age
or gender. They can hit anyone at any time.</i>
Ow.
What did the doctor say it was?
Suspected bicep tendonitis.
Ho-ho-ho-ho! From carrying this
season's must-have Goyard man bag?
Not quite as life-threatening as
Isadora Duncan's silk scarf moment,
but more embarrassing, because, unlike
her, I've stayed alive to claim my shame.
My God, I want those tongs.
Hands off.
They're vintage.
<i>I wasn't always a quirky window
dresser in downtown New York.</i>
<i>I was a quirky kid in downtown Reading.</i>
(Kylie) They're amazing.
<i>And when I was 13, I
decided to stop speaking.</i>
Can you do that again with subtitles?
It's the way they glisten in the light.
- Ooh.
- How many times a woman need to say it?
Don't covet my tongs. I won those tongs in a
Black Hair & Beauty show, freestyle section.
They will never be yours.
I take them to my grave.
- Do I make myself clear?
- God!
Huh!
Her new do is Just so now, girlfriend.
<i>The reason I stopped speaking was
because I convinced myself I'd got...</i>
Gonorrhoea.
- What?
- What?
- What?
- What?
- There's an echo.
- Gonorrhoea.
- We're eating custard.
- I thought you were being serious.
- I am.
- You wish.
- (Fart)
- You're gonna have to get Mummy to the vet.
- She's unnaturally rotund. -
Shut up. She's Just big-boned.
Anyway, what is all this about
gonorrhoea, Simon? Have you ever had sex?
- Simon?
- No.
His voice Just broke.
Then it's unlikely you've concocted a sexually
transmitted disease. If it was her saying it...
- Debbie.
- Thanks.
<i>I blame our form tutor Miss Dunderdale.</i>
- You put the lotion on your pubic thatch.
- (Giggling)
But be careful, the lotion is Day-Glo
blue and it marks your fingers.
So if you ever see
someone with blue fingers,
it is more than likely that they
have an infestation of crabs.
Simon, what did I Just say?
- If you get crabs, your fingers go blue?
- Have a house point.
<i>- (# Steps: 5,6,7,8)
- Now, gonorrhea.</i>
<i>(Simon) Never mind gonorrhea. I
had paranoia. It's a lot worse.</i>
<i># My boot-scootin'

<i># My obsession for a western,

Bollocks!
Oi, woofter! What you lookin' at?
Eh?
Aaaaghhh! Miss! Miss!
You have, you've got crabs.
Maybe some of them got into
my mouth and made me contract.
Miss Dunderdale likes the
sound of her own voice.
Any relation?
And not everything she says is true.
He said, "Libby..." That's
my Christian name. "Libby..."
No offence, Mohammed.
"You've got your finger on the pulse.
"Would you like to open
a record shop with me?"
I said, "No, teaching's my vocation."
And what was that man's name?
Richard Branson.
I said, "I'd love to organise the security for
the wedding of the century, thank you, ma'am.
"Now, stop throwing up and try some
of this lovely Death By Chocolate, hm?"
And what was the name
of that retching royal?
Lady Princess Diana.
<i>But, hey, fear of germs is
nothing compared to the big D.</i>
- What did the vet say? - He
recommended an apples-only diet.
If Mummy doesn't lose
weight soon, she's gonna die.
(Hyperventilating)
Simon, everyone dies
eventually, even you.
(Sobbing)
(Family sobs)
He was the best brother in the world.
I was only vile to him cos
of sibling rivalry and shit!
(All wailing)
I know I beat him up and that,
but it was only 'cause I
couldn't bring myself to tell him
how much I idolised his
innate sense of style.
(Family wailing)
<i>(#Janet Jackson... Got 'Til It's Gone)</i>
Oh, you ain't gonna die, girlfriend.
I am, unless I get myself
cryogenically suspended.
But we're gonna move to London,
and who will we live amongst?
The beautiful people.
Now, is it time for
this to come off yet?
<i># Now you're realisin' when

(Shrieking)
Makin' my son look like
a batty boy, batty boy!
- Get out, you great wet nelly!
- But he wanted to look like...
I don't care what he wanted to
look like! Get out! Stay out!
And don't come back!
Thin dog, slender hips.
Thin dog, slender hips.
Thin dog...
Has someone let off?
- Oh!
- Ah, Jesus.
Hayley, if you're gonna feed it apples 24
hours a day, at least clean up after it.
Shush, Debbie, be
quiet. I'm in the zone.
And I'm in the shit, literally. Simon,
get me a wet wipe and sponge that up.
- Thin dog, slender hips. Thin dog...
- What is she doing?
Visualising. She's been touching
up self-help books all day.
Visualisation's about the power of thought.
You think something hard enough and it happens.
I'm trying to think Mummy thin.
Could you try visualising
Mummy with constipation?
Could you try visualising me
being the sixth member of Steps?
How many apples has that thing
eaten? I bought 30 yesterday.
Yeah, she's got a real taste for them.
That dog's weird.
She keeps hiding my Female
Eunuch in the veg carousel.
No, that's me. You know I think
Germaine messes with your head.
What rattled you? You've got
a face longer than Céline Dion.
- She's on her blob, innit?
- Ashlene.
I Just walked past them builders on the
parade. The ones making the new tanning salon.
Now Is The Winter Of
Our Discount Tans, yeah?
- And I got wolf-whistled.
- Yeah, right.
I'd be hanging out the
flags, they ever leered at me.
- I know what it is.
- Your propensity to sport miniskirts?
- Simon.
- You're a foxy chick, Debs.
It's only natural the
fellas get aroused.
- Fair play to them.
- Dad, you're sick.
It's this hairdo. It's too tarty. I'm
gonna have to book a session with Tameka.
You boycotted Tameka after Hayley heard
her describe you as tarty at Shape'N'Tone.
She called you a dirty old slag bag.
But she only called me that cos she heard
I'd gone to Perm Suspect on the high street.
I don't trust 'em at Shape'N'Tone. Always
get a waft of kebab when I'm squatting.
I've tried every hairdressers in Reading, and
she's the only one who don't make me brassy.
D'you want me to visualise
you looking tasteful?
I'm gonna have to call her.
Aunty Hayley, in order to visualise, don't
you have to be able to see in the first place?
- Simon, don't be rude.
- I have a vivid imagination.
Simon, go and play out.
You don't get enough oxygen.
- I can't.
- Why not?
Kylie doesn't want to
be my friend any more.
- Go and play with one of your other friends.
- He hasn't got any.
- Well, then, go and play with yourself.
- Mother!
I said, "Girls, don't come
trick-or-treating at my door,
"go away and do something
constructive with your lives."
So they did. And what were their names?
The Spice Girls.

- Want me to teach you a Steps dance routine?
- Steps is racist.
"Are racist", and they're not.
- They're all white.
- I thought you hated them.
If you haven't got any mates, go out and make
some new ones. You're doin' my nut in, guy.
All right, I will.

Drop dead, Tameka.
- (Whines)
- Come on, Mummy.
Oh, she's rank, guy. The size of her.
If I was that big, I'd never go out.
She won't go on, Aunty
Hayley. Shall I get Dad?
Nah, coax her with a Golden Delicious.
Come on, catch!
Oops.
Right.
Come on, Mummy, on the scales.
(Pants and whines)
Who's a good girl?
- What's she supposed to weigh?
- 70 pounds. Why, how much does she weigh?
- A hundred and ten.
- (Crunch)
(Fart)
I'm going out with the
girls from work tonight.
That new Irish theme pub, the
Impressive Crack. You been?
Tameka, I'm so sorry I went off
and tried other hairdressers.
It was foolish of me and I won't
ever do it again, I promise.
Look, I know you called me
some names at Shape'N'Tone.
It was Bums & Tums.
And threw a brick at me in the street.
And put up false prostitute cards in
phone boxes with my number on it, but...
I was hurting, Debbie. Does a
faithful dog expect to be kicked?
Look, I may come across as
if I have a heart of stone,
but cut me and I bleed,
Debbie Doonan, I bleed.
- I know. If it's any consolation, I feel awful.
- You look awful.
- I don't look that bad.
- You do.
Right. Well, you better
work your wonders, then.
I think I better had.
Are we friends again?
(Both laugh)
Oh, Debs!
Here, you've missed some serious
gossip while you've been away.
Have I? I knew it.
Now, why don't I get
us a nice glass of rum,
and I will tell you all about Candy
Lam and her one-fingered gynaecologist.
<i># Goldfinger! #</i>
Mm-mm-mm!
Visualisation is all
complete and utter bollocks.
Say it out loud and
it happens? Codswallop.
Picture it and it's
there? Don't make me laugh.
And what good are apples gonna
do, eh? She eats about 80 a day.
Today she started licking a traffic warden
Just cos she was wearing apple-blossom scent.
The traffic warden didn't mind. She
herself exhibits a very frisky chow.
What are you doing?
Throwing away all my Power Of Thought And
Visualisation books. They're a waste of money.
Aunty Hayley, they're my school books.
- These are your visualisation books here.
- Oh.
- Why didn't you stop her?
- Sorry.
Oh, they've got food all over them now.
- Everyone at school's gonna call me a pikey.
- Makes a change from effeminate woofter.
- He's not effeminate.
- Helen Keller could tell he was effeminate.
- He's Just autistic.
- I'm artistic.
Oh, yeah, I always
get those two mixed up.
<i># Doo-doo, doo-doo,

<i># I was defeated! You won the war! #</i>

<i># Ra-ra, Rasputin! #</i>
- You all right, love?
- Yeah. Oh! Oh, my!
Oh! Here, you'll never guess what
your Simon said to me the other day.
What?
He was outside the
shop dancing to Steps.
- He loves them Steps.
- Mm.
I'd like to line them up
and shoot them, personally.
(Both laugh)
He was outside and then he...
Ow!
Oh, bollocks.
- (Sobbing)
- (Sobbing)
<i>Mum and Aunty Hayley were
really into competitive mourning.</i>
(Both sobbing)
(Both sobbing)
Hayley, you didn't even know her.
Oh, that's true.
- (Sobs)
- Mum, what's happened to your hair?
Haven't you heard? Tameka keeled
over halfway through her bob.
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, if you believe in life after death.
Drop dead, Tameka!
Oh, my...
<i>So Aunty Hayley was wrong.</i>
<i>Visualising did work.</i>
<i>I'd told Tameka to
drop dead, and she did.</i>
<i>I'd ended a life.</i>
(Laughter outside)
<i>I'd ended my friendship with Kylie.</i>
<i>And I'd ended my mum's reputation
as the most stylish woman in Reading.</i>
<i>How ever would I recover from this?</i>
- (Whispers) Are you awake?
- You smell of apples.
Apple daiquiri. I had to
fight Mummy off in the hall.
Before she died,
Tameka said she'd seen you.
She was about to tell me what you
said to her, only she never got it out.
I know what you told her.
You told her I thought she was
the bee's knees, didn't you?
You're a good boy, Simon. I love you.
Why?
I love you no matter what,
Simon. That's what mums do.
Even if I'd murdered someone?
Even if you'd garrotted them
and chopped them up into little
bits and fed them to piranhas.
And then killed the piranhas,
and force-fed the killer fish
to me, making my face go green,
causing it to turn 360
degrees à la Exorcist
shouting "Choke, bitch, choke,
you twisted psycho mother, you!"
Oh, sweet dreams.
(Creaks)
<i>Still, if a mother's love is unconditional,
maybe things were finally looking up.</i>
Who's my handsome boy, eh?
Stick telly on, Simon.
<i>Fat chance.</i>
<i>This is BBC Television from London.</i>
<i>Diana Princess of Wales has
died after a car crash in Paris.</i>
<i>She was taken to a hospital
in the city early this morning.</i>
<i>Surgeons spent two hours
trying to save her life,</i>
<i>but she died at four o'clock
from severe chest inJuries.</i>

<i># I will deliver</i>
<i># If your cloud is

<i># And I don't know if

<i># But there are times
that I go to the wall</i>
<i># So sometimes I need you</i>
<i>#Just to call my name in a quiet hour...</i>
I thought maybe...
Kylie'd want to mourn the passing
of the Queen of Hearts with me.
He's too distraught.
I had to sedate him
with some Night Nurse.
Please.
(Sighs)
Move on, Simon, eh? Move on.
<i># Sometimes I need you</i>
<i># Let me know the truth</i>
<i># When "sorry"Just won't do</i>
<i># Sometimes I need you...</i>
- My Uncle Terry died in a car crash.
- The one with the eye?
The other one, driving back from
IKEA, bunny-hopped off the Westway,
and buried himself under a flat-pack
armoire-come-drinks cabinet.
- That's terrible.
- I know.
We tried assembling it at the wake
but three of the screws were missing.
I'm worried about Simon.
He's gone all morbid.
Christ. He'll be listening
to Morrissey next.
He needs to get over this death thing.
- You've got me here under false pretences!
- She won't bite.
We were going shopping for a Tamagotchi.
Simon, you have got to stop
being freaked out by death.
- But...
- One day, you'll see me or Dad in a coffin,
and I don't want that to be your
first experience of a corpse.
Oh, she looks happy.
Mind you, she went to Clacton last
week. Did her the world of good.
See. It's not scary, is it?
<i>(Simon) Now, I bet you think
I'm going to steal those tongs.</i>
<i>How else would they
end up in my possession?</i>
<i>Think again.</i>
- I killed her.
- Simon.
- But I did.
- Stop showing off.
I told her to drop dead,
and she did.
Ha-ha-ha!
- So that's what you said to her.
- It's not funny.
- Well, she thought it was.
- Eh?
Oh, Simon, she had a hole in the heart and a
liver the size of Guatemala from all that rum.
(Giggling)
Touch her. Dare you.
- Why?
- See what she feels like.
- You touch her.
- I've touched loads of corpses.
- And why would I want to touch her?
- Cos if it was me, you'd want to touch me.
- But it's not you.
- And the sensation might upset you.
But this way, you'll
know what it's like.
I'll buy you the Tamagotchi.
No, not there, not between her legs.

Oh, well, they'll be going

- Will they?
- Yeah, they'll go past the maternity hospital.
She opened that KFC concession in it.
- Really?
- Yeah, I went there with the Blind Bingo lot.
