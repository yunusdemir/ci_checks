All right, what do you need?
Bottle rockets? Dental dams? Reddi-wips?
Term papers.
Uh, actually, no.
No, I'm Tom Lawrence. I'm a pre-frosh.
Uh, I'm just up here
a-at Port Chester just...
just to see
if I want to go here.
What am I,
a stop on the tour?
Actually, a-a-admissions
arranged for me to, uh...
t-to spend the night
at y-your frat.
Gee, Scooter,
frats were banned in the '60s.
They were?
Let me see that.
I don't believe this.
I've been pimped by admissions.
- Okay. Want some advice?
- Well, yeah...
Here's all you need to know.
Classes: Nothing before 11:00.
Beer: It's your best friend,
you drink a lot of it.
- Women? You're a freshman, so it's
out of the question. We have a car?
- No.
Someone on your hall will.
Make friends with them on
the first day. Anything else?
Yeah, um...
Look, uh,
can anyone just, um...
live in these big houses
with... with girls?
Times have changed
in the past 30 years, Tomás.
We no longer swill sherry
and screw goats for fun anymore.
I'd love to tell you
all about it, but...
I'd love to tell you
all about it, but...
- Should I just leave
my stuff in your room?
- Uh, no.
Look, I'd like to help you, but we're

But the good news is, I got
just the guy for the job.

- Got any smokes, baby?

- Tom-man here's a pre-frosh.

- Hi.

- Whoa, Gut. Can't or won't?
Can't, man.
It's grunge night at Vienna House.
The Merkins are opening
for Frog And Toad Are Friends.
I gotta psych up for the show.
Frog And Toad Are Friends. That's with
the guy from the Clash, right?
- The...
- The Clash.
<i>I don't know if you're aware,</i>
<i>but there actually was music</i>
<i>recorded before 1989.</i>
What is this? You're gonna
wear this to the show?
You're gonna wear the shirt
of the band you're gonna go see?
Don't be that guy.
Hey! Hey, hey. What's up,
my brothers? Here we go.
- [Both Chattering]
- Just a quick moment...
That's all right.
- Mullaney.
- Yeah, what's up?
- Is this a pre-frosh?
- Yes.
And you're showing him
around the campus? That's really swell.
Make sure he gives you
the special bicentennial tour...
200 years of bullshit.
- You little bitch.
- Yeah? Now we're even
for the Milk-Bones.
You signed me up
as a weekend host.
- You swing bag.
- Sucker!
- Milk-Bones?
- Spring break.
I filled his suitcase with dog biscuits
coming back from Jamaica.
- Hmm?
- Drug-sniffing dogs went ape-shit.
I got one more idea.
- <i>[Tires Screeching]</i>
- Pigman.
- Pigman!
- What's he doing?
He's finishing
his senior thesis.
Pigman is trying to prove
the Caine-Hackman theory.
<i>No matter what time it is,</i>
<i>you can find a Michael Caine</i>
<i>or a Gene Hackman movie on TV.</i>
- Wait, that's his thesis?
- Yes!
That's the beauty of college
these days, Tommy.
You can major in Game Boy if you know
how to bullshit. Have a seat.
There's the TV.
Pigman's got you covered.
Call me for the shower scene
in <i>Dressed to Kill.</i>
Uh...
[Sighs]
What?
Did I tell you
that I'm from Delaware?
Really?
Well, I mean,
I just spent s-six hou...
<i>six hours on a public bus</i>
<i>just to come to Port Chester...</i>
to decide
if I want to come here.
So maybe I should see the campus
or a pep rally or a tailgate party or...
Okay, okay, I...
I've got it.
Here's the deal.
You gotta get all this '50s
cornball shit out of your head.
It's a whole new ball game on campus
these days, and they call it P.C.
- "P.C."?
- <i>Politically correct.</i>
[Droz] And it's not just politics...
it's everything.
It's what you eat, it's what you wear
and it's what you say.
If you don't watch yourself,
you can get in a butt-load
of trouble. For instance...

- <i>[Droz] See these girls?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>
No, those are <i>women.</i> Call 'em girls,
and they'll pop your figs.
- Save the whales!
- Gays in the military now!
- Free Nelson Mandela!
- They freed him already.
What?
Those women?
Those aren't women, Tom.
Those are "womynists."
You know, I saw
the new Madonna video last night.
[Snickers]
Un-frickin-believable.
See the one in the middle,
the one with the blonde hair?
- <i>[Tom] Yeah.</i>
- <i>She's looking at me, isn't she?</i>
Kinda. Do you know her
or something?
Hey, Sam, isn't that the guy
that you used to, uh...
Yeah.
- You went out with a white male?
- I was a freshman!
- <i>Freshperson,</i> please.
- Please.
- Go talk to her. What's the problem?
- Watch this.
He's coming over here.
Sisters, form a wall!
- [Whistle Blows]
- <i>[Sam] No, you don't have to do that.</i>
Wow. Hi.
How you doin'?
Uh, is Sam in there?
"In there"? What's that
supposed to mean?
Yeah,
cock man oppressor.
Uh, thank you.
Maybe one of you could just
tell her that Mr. Pokey stopped by.
Okay.
What the hell was that?
"Mr. Pokey"?
I think he meant
his, uh, phallus.
You participated
in a phallus naming?
No. No.
I have no idea...
You stay away from him, Sam.
He's an animal.
You know, this place
is kinda insane.
Wait till you meet
the causeheads.
The what?
- What don't we eat?
- <i>[Crowd] Red meat.!</i>
- Why don't we eat it?
- It's murder!
- What don't we eat?
- Red meat!
Why don't we eat it?
These, Tom,

They find a world-threatening issue
and stick with it... for about a week.
What's up?
What happened to the ozone layer?
That was last week.
Now it's meat.
Grill's serving up chili burgers, but
they're not letting anyone in or out.
I love chili burgers.
What about you, Daves?
- [Both] Yeah.
- Let's do lunch.
- <i>[Woman] What don't we eat?</i>
- All right.
- Red meat!

"Level of insensitivity."
"C"...unconscionable.
"Offended."
Oh, thank God.
President Garcia-Thompson.
Students, fill out those forms
and don't skip a line.
- It was those persons in the Pit again.
- I know, Moonbeam.
Those Pit offenders are
single-handedly destroying...
the sensitivity levels
on this campus.
- But...
- Of course I can't simply
throw them out of school.
After all, they're still 15 complaints
away from expulsion.
Don't worry.
Their day will come.
Um, Ms. President?
There's some preppy person
in your office.
Madras ties.
Sweet.
McPherson,
what the hell are you doing?
Ooh, pretty outfit.
Real summery.
What is that, Dacron?
How many times have I told you
not to meet me here?
- I have a reputation to uphold.
- Don't run from your feelings.
I think it's time people
know the truth about us.
The truth, McPherson,
is that you disgust me.
The only thing we'll ever
have in common is a hatred of the Pit.
Just give it time.
The information,
Republican.
Signed, sealed and...
snatched rudely...
what a surprise.
Perfect. I'll bring it
to the Pit immediately.
And we'll call
the movers.
- Hey, Jack!
- [Gasps]
Floor's closed unless
you're working on a thesis.
You working on a thesis?
Uh, no, no, I'm lost. I'm just

your anti-community crimes.
Hello, Mrs. Garc...
President
Garcia-Thompson.
<i>Hey, monkeys,</i>
<i>how about a little respect?</i>
The presiding person of the university
just walked in.
** ["Hail To The Chief"]
Stop that.
Turn that noise pollution down.

Please put out
that cigarette right now.
Oh. All right.
<i>Do I need to remind you</i>
<i>that this house already</i>
<i>has enough complaints...</i>
to qualify for
a sensitivity awareness weekend?
You passed out cigarettes for
a smoke-a-thon on Earth Day...
you installed speed bumps
on the handicapped ramps...
<i>and most recently you dumped</i>
<i>a hundred pounds of...</i>
<i>meat</i> on a peaceful
vegan protest.
That was way more
than a hundred pounds.
- Very amusing, Mr. Andrews.
- Thanks.
- [Laughing]
- <i>Here's something you won't</i>
<i>find quite so funny.</i>
This, offenders,
is your damage bill for the semester.
The total comes to
$7,568.
<i>Housing forms for next year</i>
<i>are due Monday...</i>
and if that bill isn't paid,
this house will be repossessed.
- What?
- You can't be serious, right?
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a bicentennial to plan.
- <i>[Mullaney] She's serious?</i>
- <i>[Cecilia] This sucks.</i>
- <i>[Gut] Ma'am, can</i>... <i>Ma'am, hello?</i>
- [Kissing Sounds]
- Seven thou?
- We're in deep shit, huh?
- Where are we gonna live?
- It's, like, three weeks
before school ends.
Ladies and gentlemen, I think it's time
to revive an ancient tradition...
we seem to have
long forgotten.
They confiscated
the altar, Droz.
No, I'm not talking
about human sacrifice, Ceel.
I'm talking about something we
used to do every Saturday night
as a matter of principle.
Here's a hint.
Legions of
hand-stamped meatheads...
and coed naked
lacrosse T-shirts...
power-chugging
watered-down Meisterchau...
<i>regurgitating</i>
<i>on the glue</i>- <i>matted floors.</i>
Kiln-like temperatures,
fights with townies...
lines of drunken people
waiting for the bathroom.
Wait a second. You guys
are talking about a party.
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding.
Gutter, tell her what's she's won.
<i>We get some beer,</i>
<i>we have a band...</i>
and we overcharge
at the door.
Droz, there's no way.
We'd need an all-campus party
to raise enough money.
No one's been able
to pull that off in years.
- You know what happens.
Half the school protests.
- The other half boycotts.
Yeah, and even if
we could get them all here,
it'd be a total P.C. war zone.
Well, there is one other option.
We get jobs.
- I vote party.
- I can't handle a job, man.
Sounds good.
What do you want us to do?
So, uh,
who's on beer?
Uh, well, that would
roughly be you, Gut.
I suggest kegs...
multiple, cold and domestic.
I have to meet Mersh in Jerrytown
for my ride to the show.
Okay, well, you call those useless
Frisbee-chucking cheeba-monkeys...
and tell 'em you're
gonna be an hour late.
Ceel, Katy, Raj and Deege,
your band will play.
- Oh, sweetJesus!
- Droz, we don't even have a name.
Get a name, give it to the Daves,
they'll put up the flyers.
- On it.
- Pigman.
- Huh?
- Stay put.
We charge five bucks a head.
MasterCard and Visa accepted.
Droz, what happened
to that cute preppy kid?
Who?
The pre-frosh.
That's a good question.

We got intramural finals
this afternoon, man. Sorry.
Well, what am I

I think the womynists
will be quite interested
in your little scribblings.
Oh, yeah.
That's where I'm headed.
Samantha,
always a pleasure.
See ya.
[Sighs]
Gentlemen.
Ladies?
A Pit party?
Mmm.
Warm, flat beer.
- [Exclaiming]
- Soggy chips. Think about that.
That's just what I need
to help me figure out my life.
Stop the penis party!
Get away from him!
- Come on, Sam!
- Let's go.
- Hey, Sam, what about tonight?
- Don't talk to him!
Shit.
Whoo-hoo! Yea!

Yeah, sure.
She knows.

She knows.
Okay, just...
just go here for a minute.
I shouldn't
have smoked that.
I just, uh,
want to pay tribute...
to, uh, both
your courage...
and for your,
your eloquence...
and for the dignity...
<i>in which you've</i>
<i>conducted yourself.</i>
Thank you, Senator.
It knew it was going to be bad
when I was nominated.
I did not know
it would be this bad.

- Excuse me. Andrea, the members...
- It's Andréa.
I think hockey.
Call me about it.
The board of trustees
is very concerned...
about the state of unrest
among the students.
There has been a protest
on this campus every day...
and frankly, we're sick
of all the bad publicity.
Oh, really?
<i>We're particularly concerned</i>
<i>about tomorrow's bicentennial.</i>
<i>It will be the most highly attended</i>
<i>alumni event in years.</i>
Gentlemen, relax. Tomorrow's ceremony
has been planned to perfection.
And as for the students,
I have a special surprise for them.
What are you
talking about?
I'm going to announce the changing
of the school mascot...
from the offensive
Port Chester Indian...
to an endangered specie.
Gentlemen,
meet our new mascot...
the Port Chester
Whooping Crane.
[Chittering]
No! Wait! No!

Hey, look.
It's a college boy.
- Anybody wanna beat him up?

- Huh?
The flyers. I haven't
seen one up on campus.
- We put one up.
- Damn, man!
- Great.
- <i>One flyer?</i>
- We're screwed.
There is one thing
we can still do.
- Play some loud and abusive tunes?
- Exactly.
Do it.
Plug my ass in.
Yeah.

- What the hell's going on here?
- Hi, Droz.
Uh, are we having a party tonight,
or what?
Well, there's no publicity,
so there's no people.
Gutter never showed up,
so there's no beer.
Our instruments just blew out,
so there's no band,
and Raji and Deege may be dead.
Wait a minute.
No beer?
Where the hell's Gutter?
Probably in a parking lot somewhere
picking his nose.
- Well, there's one consolation.
- What's that?
We haven't
been protested yet.
<i>Does anybody know why</i>
<i>there are 24 womynists</i>
<i>beating bongos on our lawn?</i>
Stop the style of oppression
that <i>this</i> house...
- What?
- Let's check it out.
- <i>Yeah, man.</i>
- Comin' through. Comin' through.
- <i>[Womynists Shouting]</i>
- All right.
Deadly Zulu drum protest.
Haven't seen one of those
since my third sophomore year.
- <i>[Cecilia] Full</i>- <i>on response.</i>
- <i>[Dave #1]</i>
<i>I wish the balls weren't dead.</i>
You try and spread joy...
and then
the P.C. shock troops...
just shut you down.
Don't they want to have a good time
at least once in their lives?
<i>[Shouting Continues]</i>
That's
a damn good point.
Okay, now, it's true...
the majority of students today
are so cravenly P. C...
they wouldn't know a good time
if it was sitting on their face.
But there is one thing that will
always unite us and them.
They're young!
They may not realize it yet...
but they've got
the same raging hormones...
the same self-destructive desire
to get boldly trashed...
and wildly out of control.
Look out that window.
That's not a protest.
That is a cry for help.
Stop the penis party!
Stop the penis party!
They're begging us.
"Please have a party! Feed us drinks!
Get us laid!"
<i>[Droz Screams]</i>
That's a pretty strange
theory, Droz.
Yeah. Besides, we don't
have a band or any people, man.
- We don't have...
- [Together] Any beer!
We've got loose keg sightings
near the freshman dorm.
Two cases of zinfandel
spotted near the faculty club.
And here, the mother lode...
the bicentennial ball.
- Moles, you're on the air in 10.
- Got it.

What is the

- <i>[Woman] Hello, Andréa.</i>
- <i>[Man] Nice to see you.</i>
Only three

But my community crisis
bulletin just went out. Okay?
Well, don't worry, my fair maiden.
We will get our quota.
And by the way, have you seen
their tasteless flyer?
[Gasps]
Oh, my God.
Is there no limit?
Well...
what I figure they did
was...
they cut out a picture
of your head and pasted it
on another, different picture.
I've done a little
collage work myself.

I know, but I've already managed
to piss off the entire campus.
No offense, Katy,

I'm probably just gonna
wind up at State.
[Sighs] Yeah, well, we're all gonna be

- What do you mean?
- We gotta raise seven G's by

- The Pit?
- Yeah.

We're trying to pull off this

oppressors.
<i>I've got one question.</i>
If we're movin' out,
who's movin' in?
Hi, everybody.
Hey, what's wrong?
Aw, looks like you guys
went all out tonight.
Raised $7,000.
Wow!
What's the matter, forehead?
Trying to figure it out?
Well, let's see.
We give you the damage bill.
You, of course,
predictably throw a disgusting party...
all the freaky freakies come out
of the woodwork to protest...
<i>and you're out ofhere.</i>
<i>Well, we still</i>
<i>trashed your Beemer...</i>
you screaming
preppy asshole.
- [Laughing]
- <i>Right.!</i>
That's not my car.
<i>[Alarm Beeps] Warning.</i>
<i>You are too close to the vehicle.</i>
Huh.
Now get off my lawn.
Move!
<i>Wait a second. You guys</i>
<i>can't let them just walk in</i>
<i>and take the Pit.</i>
We could go Waco on 'em, man.
We could blow up our own house.
Nah, ran out of explosives.
What we need is a plan.
Okay, Garcia-Thompson's
the president.
She's the one that's
kicking you out. Right?
- Yeah.
- What if she wasn't
the president anymore?
<i>Sounds nice in theory. But how</i>
<i>are we supposed to pull that one off?</i>
I overheard some
old guys talking.
They wanna get rid ofThompson,
but legally they can't...
not unless she screws something up
really, really big.
****<i>[Marching Band]</i>
Whoo.
Whoo.
I'd like to welcome everyone
to Port Chester's 200th
anniversary celebration.
<i>Before we get started,</i>
<i>please observe...</i>
that your program notes
have been printed on recycled paper.
- Birthdays are a way of
remembering one's history.
- Perfect.
Those homeless people at the Pit
didn't even bother to show.
They're probably grubbin' quarters
at the bus station by now.
Welcome P.C.U.'s
most recent change...
<i>our new school mascot...</i>
<i>the Port Chester</i>
<i>whooping crane.</i>
Hey, guys,
it's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- Oh, God. Not now! [Struggling]
- Hey, what's up?
- <i>[Grunting]</i>
- <i>Threatened by hunters and developers...</i>
<i>and those awful plastic</i>
<i>six</i>- <i>pack can holder things.</i>
But here at Port Chester, she will be
closely watched and tended to...
<i>safe from the natural habitat</i>
<i>that is so fraught with danger.</i>
- Oh, my God.
- <i>[Student]</i>
<i>I hear they taste like chicken.</i>
- What's he doing?
- Let's give it up
for Andrea Garcia-Thompson...
<i>and her amazing and impromptu</i>
<i>rare bird show.</i>
The bird show. The amazing bird show.
The wonderful bird show.
- <i>The bird show.!</i>
- [Cheers]
<i>I don't have a lot of time to say this</i>
<i>but I gotta get something off my chest.</i>
Last night,
my house threw a party...
and I thought that we all
finally got along.
We had a good time.
<i>But we got so many protests,</i>
<i>we broke so many rules...</i>
that we got booted
off campus.
You know, it used to be
the administration's job to make rules.
It used to be us against them.
Now it's us against us.
I've been here seven years
and I gotta tell you guys...
<i>what's going on here</i>
<i>is about America.</i>
- Shut up.
- It's about democracy.
It's about the Bill of Rights,
basic cable, call-waiting,
free trips to the salad bar.
<i>It's about everything that</i>
<i>makes this country great.</i> Our <i>country.!</i>
We can do something
about this.
We can finally say...
that when some people
are having a good time...
and drinking some beers,
throwing some meat...
<i>that we're not</i>
<i>gonna protest.</i>
In fact, I promised myself
I wouldn't do this. I'm sorry.
<i>If we couldjust say that,</i>
<i>if only to each other...</i>
<i>just this one time...</i>
that we're not
gonna protest.
That we're not
gonna protest?
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
<i>[Droz]</i>
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
<i>[Chanting]</i>
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
We're not gonna protest!
This is not good.
This is really not good.
We're not gonna protest!
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
Chant sheets!
Get your chant sheets. Right here.
We got placards here.
Placards here. We got 'em.
Okay, we got placards here.
We got placards for everybody...
We brought our own.
[Chanting Continues]
We're not gonna protest!
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.
<i>Everyone, please,</i>
<i>take your seats.</i>
- We're not gonna protest!
- <i>Be quiet.! I'm asking you</i>
<i>to be quiet, everyone.</i>
<i>Be quiet.!</i>
B.D., get us out of here
before they touch me.
[Whining]
<i>Please take your seats.</i>
<i>Be quiet.! I'm</i>...
Thompson, your inability
to control the students...
has convinced us that you are
an ineffective president.
What? What are you
talking about?
You're fired, Thompson.
Dismissed. Booted. Sacked.
History. Shit-canned.
Out of here.
What are you doing?
B.D., go beat up the pre-frosh.
- The little kid?
- He's a Pit spy, Neanderthal.
Kick his ass.
Thanks, guys.
I feel much better now.
Oh, Okay. Thank you.
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
- Gutter is a tool.
- <i>[Crowd] Gutter is a tool.</i>
<i>We're not gonna protest.!</i>
Here's to Balls and Shaft!
[Groans]
I scheme for months and
it all gets screwed up because
you can't control the students!
Never send a woman
to do a man's job!
You cocky, pointy-nosed
little Reaganite.
If you hadn't provoked them,
we wouldn't be in this mess.
Excuse me? Reality check here.
Earth to tall bitch.
What is your fault?
This is.
Hey, poor boy, go and have
your parties with all your new friends.
I can see it now,
Andrews.
You and all the knee-jerk,
bleeding heart liberals...
<i>sipping tea and playing patty</i>- <i>cake,</i>
<i>and those useless...</i>
<i>hippie potheads,</i>
<i>those commie</i>- <i>pinko le</i>ft<i>ists...</i>
<i>the bunny huggers,</i>
<i>the pillow biters</i>...
Wait. Which ones are
the pillow biters?
The butt-pirates.
And those beastly man-haters.
Tell those chicks
to shave their pits and call me.
<i>Goddamn whiny crybaby minorities.</i>
<i>You can keep 'em all.</i>
Rand McPherson,
everybody.
Just remember the 9:30 show is
completely different from the 7:30 show.
Enjoy the meal.
- Come on! Come on!
- [Whining]
<i>And in light of your valiant</i>
<i>actions to save this house...</i>
we all think it's time to take part in
the one tradition left over...
from the dark days
of Balls and Shaft.
Tom Lawrence,
prepare yourself...
for initiation.
Just try to relax.
- Uh, Droz.
- Yeah?
- There's my bus.
- What?
- <i>[Gutter] Oh, man.</i>
- [Horn Honks]
Damn! Well, just gonna
have to get you next year.
[Chuckles]
Don't let him
scare you.
- It's only hurts for a minute.
- Check her out.
Yo, Gut man. Watch the stylings
on the youngster.
Nice.
- I'll see ya.
- [Groaning]
- In the fall.
- Yeah!
- <i>All right, little half</i>- <i>chunk.</i>
- <i>Bye, Tom.</i>
What? You want it?
You want it?
[Katy]
Hey, Cecilia, wait up.
- Am I interrupting anything?
- No. We were just rehearsing.
- <i>The Nutcracker.</i>
- Really?
Yeah, on ice.
Should be pretty decent
once we get Gutter up on skates.
- God, I think I'd actually
pay to see that.
- You would?
Let's get out of here.
You and I. Seriously.
Just hit the road.
Actually, I was thinking more along
the lines of a cup of coffee.
- A cup of coffee?
- Yeah.
Let's do that.
- Hey, let's drive down.
- Indeed, driving for coffee.
We don't have a car.
I do.
For the weekend anyway.
My aunt loaned me
her red BMW convertible.
Really?
****<i>[Rock]</i>
Aah!
