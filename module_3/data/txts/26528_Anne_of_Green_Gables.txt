Give me that.
Good morning, Rachel.
How are you?
You know me, I'm not a complainer.
Goes without saying.
But my old bursitis
has been acting up.
And I've got that tingling
in my hands again.
Never mind I haven't had
a decent sleep in weeks.
But why go on.
- Indeed.
Your brother not feeling
social again?
No, Matthew has a very special
chore this morning.
All right now, Harry. We got
some important business today.
So I need you on
your best behavior.
There you go, good boy.
Abner!
Abner, you're gonna run...
Come back here!
Abner, I don't have time
to fool with you.
Abner! Come here!
Come here!
Abner, I'm not in the mood.
Hey, you little runner!
Get back here. Abner!
Get outta there!
Abner!
Lord, give me strength.
Matthew! You're supposed to be
at the station.
I know! I had an accident.
What's happened?
Are you all right?
I'm happy as a pet crow.
You see, that is exactly why
we're doing what we're doing.
Lord. You're supposed to be
there already.
Please, stop fustling. I'm...
From now on, things are gonna be
different around here.
Go on, change all your clothes.
It's disgusting.
Hello, Rachel!
I doozy up pretty good,
don't you think?
- An orphan? You can't be serious.
- We are.
What in heaven's name
are you thinking?
Matthew needs some help
with chores.
Dorothy Spencer said
she was going down to Hopetown...
...to get herself a girl. We asked
her to bring us back a boy.
But an orphan, really?
Are you sure?
We aim to give him a good home.
Good education.
But you don't know anything about
him. He might be a gypsy child.
Or worse.
- Rachel!
Just last week I read in the paper
about a boy...
...who set fire to the house.
Nearly burnt the poor couple...
...to a crisp.
- Rachel!
And there was another one. A girl.
She took a rifle...
...and shot the whole family.
Then she slit their throats...
...with a bread knife.
Even the baby.
I were you I'd keep
my bedroom door locked.
And a knife under my pillow.
We're not getting a girl.
We're getting a boy.
Hello?
Edwin. The twelve-thirty
come through?
Right on time, Matthew.
Exactly one hour
and four minutes ago.
Well, I... Never mind.
We're excepting a youngster.
Came in with Mrs. Spencer.
Where about?
Outside.
Hello?
That's a girl outside. A girl.
- Most girls are.
We're expecting a boy.
Where is he?
- Must've been a mix-up.
- We asked for a boy.
- Maybe they're fresh out.
- Edmond, please.
Are you Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of
Green Gables?
Yes, I am.
How do you do?
My name is Anne Shirley.
And this is for you.
I was beginning to fear something
terrible had happened.
So I made up my mind if you didn't
come for me...
...I'd climb up into some tree
and stay up there all night.
It would be lovely to sleep
in a tree.
Wild, crooked, white with bloom.
Can you imagine in the moonlight
how it would look?
Well...
Did you come in a wagon?
Yes, I do.
No, that's all right.
It's not heavy. Besides, if it
isn't carried in a certain way...
...the handle pulls out.
So I'd better hang onto it because
I know the exact knack of it.
Best to Marilla.
This island is even more
wondrous than I imagined.
And I can tell you
that's saying quite a lot.
Are there trees
around Green Gables?
I adore trees. There were
some at the orphanage...
...but they were scrawny.
By any chance,
is there a babbling brook?
Yes. Just a look and a half
from the house.
Really?
It's always been one of
my dreams to live near a brook.
I never expected I would, though.
Mr. Cuthbert, why is the earth red?
Well now, that's a fair question.
I don't...
I don't exactly know why.
Well now, that's something else
to find out about one day.
Look, do you see
that colorful bird?
Where?
You see, up there!
Mr. Cuthbert?
Who was Prince Edward? Was he
a real prince or make-believe?
Prince Edward...
No matter, it's all the same to me.
And something else
to find out about.
Isn't it just splendid to think
of all the things...
...there are to find out about?
It wouldn't be half
so interesting...
...if we knew everything
about everything, would it?
No, I suppose not
What is that sound?
Spring peepers.
They are little tiny frogs.
Right down there in Barry's Pond.
Barry's Pond?
No, that's much too plain.
It should be something
glorious and romantic like...
I know!
Lake of Shining Waters.
Shining Waters, huh?
Our brook flows
right the way down into it.
I'm sorry. Sometimes I dream
when I'm wide awake.
Do you ever do that?
Not lately.
I love dreaming, even though I know
they don't always come true.
Right now I'm so near
perfectly happy I can't tell...
...if I'm dreaming or not.
- Well now...
Listen, Miss Anne. You know,
my sister Marilla...
But what's so terrible is
I can't ever be...
...perfectly happy because...
What color would you
call this hair?
Well, I would say it's red.
But there are other colors
in there too.
Exactly.
Nobody who has hair
this horrible...
...could possibly ever be
perfectly happy.
It will be my lifelong sorrow.
Am I talking too much?
People always tell me I do.
And I know I embellish...
...and I know
that's not proper but...
There I go again.
Would you rather I didn't speak?
Guess I don't mind.
Just that the bottom of this hill,
just past the trees...
...you can see Green Gables.
It's exactly as I imagined it.
Thank heavens. I thought you
must have crashed in a ditch...
No.
What's the meaning of this?
- Now, Marilla...
- That's not a boy.
You're not a boy.
If you'll just let me explain...
I told Mrs. Spencer to bring us
a boy. I was very clear.
I said bring us a boy about
eleven years old.
Well, I guess they just
didn't have one.
Some pretty piece of
business this is.
What are we supposed to do
with her?
I couldn't just leave her all alone
at the station.
You don't want me
because I'm not a boy?
I might have known it was all
too beautiful to be true.
Calm now, child. There's no reason
to cry so about it.
Yes, there is a need.
This is the most tragic thing...
...that ever happened to me.
God, child. We're not going to turn
you out of doors tonight. Here.
What's your name?
If you please, would you call me
Cordelia?
It's such a perfectly
elegant name.
Your name is Cordelia?
Not exactly.
What is it? Tell me the truth.
Anne Shirley.
You see what I mean?
Two first names put together?
It stands out something awful
and if I'm starting all over...
...Cordelia would be my preference.
Fiddlesticks to all that. Anne is
a real good plain and simple name.
You've no reason to be
ashamed of it.
I'm not ashamed of it. Only I like
Cordelia so much better.
But if you must call me Anne,
would you call me...
...the kind of Anne that's spelled
with an "e" at the end.
Give me that.
Lilacs.
Ambrosia.
What a pretty path.
We call that The Avenue.
Avenue?
That name doesn't do it justice.
I know.
I'm going to call it
The White Way of Delight.
A magical place like this always
gives me a q... r...
...funny sort of ache. In here.
Did you ever have an ache
like that, Miss Cuthbert?
Not that I recall. Come along.
We'll sort all this out
in the morning.
Come along. This way.
Keep going.
Right upstairs.
Now, Harry, what do you think,
old friend?
Yeah. No, she is not a boy.
And she is a talker but...
...she is really interesting.
Gotta we met that, huh?
Abner, you're the cause of
all my troubles today.
What've you got to say
for yourself?
I'll accept your apology.
Alright, Harry, let's get
you ready for bed.
Come now, child.
You haven't eaten a thing.
Can you eat when you're
in the depths of despair?
I've never been in the depths of
despair so I wouldn't know.
Haven't you ever try to imagine
you were in the depths of despair?
Why on earth would I wanna
do thing like that?
I can assure you,
it's a very unpleasant feeling.
When you try to eat, a lump
comes right up in your throat...
...and you can't swallow
anything.
Not even if it was
a chocolate caramel.
She must be tired.
I suppose, it could be
all the travel.
Quick-quick. Into bed.
I need to blow out the oil lamp.
That's all right, I can
blow out my own lamp.
That'll be the day.
Marilla...
Do I truly have to leave
tomorrow?
I'll sort that out in the morning.
Good night, then.
This is what comes of sending word
instead of going ourselves.
Can you imagine how my message
could have gotten so twisted?
In any case, she has to
go back to the orphanage.
What is "hmmm" mean?
You don't agree?
She seems like a real sweet child.
Pity to send her back
when she's so set on staying.
- You're not thinking...
- No, I suppose not.
We don't need an orphan girl.
If I did, I'm not sure she is...
...the one I'd pick out.
And there's something else.
What's that?
There's something about her
I don't understand.
No, she's to go back.
I'll go into town first thing
in the morning and take care of it.
- Wait till after chores.
- What on earth for?
There's a chance to spend some time
with her, get to know her.
What good would that do?
For you, not much.
For the child, though
it could mean something.
Just like you to get a whim
and cling on to it.
You're not better than
an overgrown boy.
All right, I'm off to bed now.
Good night.
Give me that.
I'm sure hungry this morning.
The world doesn't seem
such a howling wilderness...
...as it did last night.
It's always better...
...to be cheerful and bear up
under affliction...
...on a sunshiny day.
For pity's sake,
will you stop talking?
You talk quite a lot
for a little girl.
- I'll be quiet now.
- That's a relief.
Marilla?
Good morning Miss Anne.
Hello Matthew.
Should I hitch up Harry?
I'll go this afternoon.
Now, young lady, I expect to
help me with the chores...
...when you finished with all that.
Lord help us all.
Now, watch your step,
it's slick in here.
You familiar with animals?
No, not at all but I've made up
my mind to enjoy this experience.
I believe it will make me a better
and more rounded person.
I see.
I believe you can enjoy
nearly anything...
...if you make up your mind to.
Look, that little pig is so pink.
Imagine being born bright pink.
It's the most bewitching color.
But I can't wear it.
Redheads can't wear pink.
Another hope dashed to the ground.
My life is a perfect graveyard of
buried hopes.
All right, come over here.
Sit down on the stool, come on.
It's alright.
There you go.
There you got the pail.
Okay. All right.
What's that called?
This is called an udder.
And these are the teats.
What you do is squeeze and pull.
Okay, you try it.
Come on, they don't bite.
Just...
There you go.
I imagine you grew up in a city.
Yeah. Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.
You happen to know your parents?
Yes, Walter und Bertha.
Aren't they lovely names?
I'm so glad they had
such nice names.
It would be a shame
to have a father named...
...something like Jedediah,
wouldn't it?
Nonsense. A name isn't important,
it's how a person behaves.
I read in a book once, a rose by
any other name smells as sweet.
But I can't believe it.
What do you think?
Haven't given that
a lot of thought.
There you go, you're getting
the knack of it.
Do you mind me asking you...
...what happened to
Walter and Bertha?
Both died of fever
when I was five years old.
Town folks were at their wits end
about what to do with me.
So Mrs. Thomas down the road
took me.
Though she was poor and
had an emotional husband.
But when he wasn't unhappy
about things...
...he was very clever
with checkers.
They had four children
younger than me.
That was my job.
Looking after the children.
Go ahead. Just go in. Don't step on
anyone. Go on through.
There you go.
There you go.
All right.
There's stuff on them!
It's only stuff!
And then Mr. Thomas died falling
under a train...
...and I ended up
in my first orphan home.
And then what happened?
Then Mrs. Hammond from up
the river came and...
...said she'd take me, seeing I
was handy with children.
Mrs. Hammond had twins three times.
I like babies in moderation, but
twins three times in succession.
In my opinion,
that's over the limit.
And what happened to Mr. Hammond?
Mr. Hammond died and Mrs. Hammond
couldn't cope with life anymore...
...so I ended up at the orphanage
at Hopetown.
The one with Mrs. Carlyle.
You'll obey my rules or be sent
to the work house.
But, Anne, these women...
...Mrs. Hammond, Mrs. Carlyle,
Mrs. Thomas...
...they were good to you, right?
I'm sure they meant to be.
I'm sure they meant to be...
...just as kind and good
as they possibly...
Look at those sea gulls!
Wouldn't you just love to be
up there?
Swooping over land
and ocean all day long?
Do you see?
My brother and I wanted a boy...
...to help with the chores
around the farm.
So you can appreciate
that when a girl showed up...
Anyway, we thought that
Social Services...
...might be able to find a home
for her. A good family.
One that will be kind to her.
Miss Cuthbert, these days there
simply aren't enough...
...good families to go around.
If you hand her over to us,
we'll either have to send her...
...back to the orphanage or to
the workhouse in Charlottetown.
But tell me you at least be able
to find a proper family for her.
Perhaps if you contact
Gladys Haines.
She's head of Presbyterian
Orphan Homes in Charlottetown.
I'm sorry, I have a desk
piled with cases.
Good day, Miss Cuthbert.
- I...
A lively young girl like you...
...should be living with a proper
family, and going to school.
So I have asked
Children's Services...
...to look out for a good home
for you.
One that has children your own age.
But in the meantime...
I can stay?
Well, yes, but it's only temporary.
Miss Cuthbert, I promise to be
the best orphan...
...you could ever hope for.
Boy or girl.
I'll help with the chores...
...and I'll try my best not to talk
too much...
...and I'll try my absolute
hardest not to allow...
...my imagination run away.
What should I call you? I know.
What about Aunt Marilla?
It would make me feel
as if I really belonged.
No, I'm not your aunt.
And I don't believe in...
...calling people names
that don't belong to them.
But you could imagine
you're my aunt.
No, I couldn't.
Don't you ever imagine things
different from the way they are?
No, never.
And Marilla will do just fine.
Marilla.
What does it mean?
I believe it's short for Amaryllis.
That is such a beautiful name.
Your mother and father must have
loved you very much.
Good day, Muriel.
How can I help you, Marilla?
Just postage stamp.
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.
Must be about
your Anne girl, is it?
Be sure you seal it up
after you've read it.
Dear Mrs. Haines...
...I'm writing to day,
Anne Shirley who was...
...mistakenly delivered to
our home in Avonlea.
Find it quite impossible
to care for her.
Mrs. Beatty suggested,
you may find a suitable family...
...for this child.
Here now, let me take that.
All right.
Well done!
Matthew...
...may I please go
see the babbling brook.
Just a peek. I would so,
so dearly love to see...
...a real babbling brook.
You promise to be careful?
Don't worry. I'm an extremely
responsible child.
Take the path behind the barn,
down the hill.
You come back
if it starts raining!
Why on earth didn't you leave her
with Mrs. Beatty?
I couldn't send her back to the
orphanage.
It's a girl had enough
hardship in her life.
Then you should have taken her to
Mrs. Spencer.
After all it was her mistake.
It's only for a short time.
It's only until Matthew takes her
into the town. We'll figure out.
Marilla, I picked these down by the
brook. May I put them in water?
Anne, this my neighbor
and my good friend, Mrs. Lynde.
How do you do?
Well, she's not much to look at.
Scrawny.
Raspberry jam hair.
My word, would you
look at those freckles.
My dear, what an odd look.
What could it mean?
It means I hate you.
I beg your pardon?
Anne!
Anne! Anne, come back in here!
Yes?
What did you say?
I said, I hate you.
Anne Shirley.
How dare you say I'm skinny
and ugly?
How dare you call me I'm freckled
and red-headed.
You are a rude, impolite,
unfeeling woman!
All right, that is quite
enough of that.
How would you like to have
such things said about you?
How would you like to be told
you were fat and clumsy...
...and probably hadn't a
spark of imagination?
You have hurt me worse than
Mrs. Thomas's intoxicated husband!
I shall never forgive you!
Never!
All right, you stop that right now.
You go up to your room...
...and you stay there
until I come and get you.
Go on!
Have you ever seen such a temper?
But you probably shouldn't have
twitted about her looks.
She...
What?
Anne.
Anne.
Sit up.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Behaving that way to your elders.
Imagine how you would feel
if somebody told you...
...straight to your face
you were nothing to look at!
I didn't say that Rachel Lynde
was right. She can be very...
Anyway, there is no excuse.
You were very rude to her.
You need to tell her
that you're sorry...
...and ask her for forgiveness.
- I won't!
- Anne!
You can punish me any way you like.
Shut me up in a dark...
...damp dungeon inhabited
by snakes and toads!
Or send me back to
that horrible orphanage.
I'm not going to
send you anywhere.
Well, whatever you do...
...I am never going to apologize
to Mrs. Lynde.
Never!
Very well. Then I think
what you should do is...
...just stay right here
until you reconsider.
Anne? I have your breakfast.
It's out here when you want it.
Miss Anne? May I come in?
All right.
How you feeling?
Quite well, thank you.
Not hungry?
Maybe later.
Later then.
Listen, Miss Anne with an "e".
My sister is a very
determined woman...
...and nobody gets the best of her.
So, if I were you...
...I'd smooth over what's between
you. And the sooner the better.
- Apologize?
- Yes. What say you?
I suppose I could do it
to oblige you.
It would be sort of true.
Since I really am sorry.
I wasn't a bit last night.
But this morning...
...I felt so ashamed of
my behavior.
Do you really truly think
I should?
I know is without you it's
terrible lonesome around here.
Now listen. Don't let onto Marilla
that I say anything about this.
I promised to keep my oar
out of the water.
So to speak.
I think I apologized pretty well.
I thought since I had to do it,
I might as well do it thoroughly.
You certainly did it thoroughly.
Next time you might wanna...
...try to control your temper
a little.
That would be easier if people
didn't twit about my hair.
That sort of thing makes me
boil right over.
You shouldn't think so much about
your looks.
I think you might be quite
a vain little girl.
How can I be vain when
I'm feeling homely?
When I look in the glass what I see
doesn't make me feel vain.
It makes me feel sorrowful
and pathetic.
Handsome is as handsome does.
Handsome does is much easier
if you're handsome is.
You might have a point.
Set it down, Anne. I'll hold it in.
It's all right Matthew.
You see, I'm ever so much stronger.
Don't you ever say your prayers
before bed?
I don't know any.
You don't know any?
Prayers. Never learned any.
But I'm good at making stuff up.
How do I start?
Well, you...
First you kneel down.
Not on the bed.
On the floor.
Why?
That's just the way it's done.
Now, you thank God for your
many blessings...
...and then you ask him humbly
for the things that you want.
Gracious Heavenly Father.
That's a good start,
don't you think?
Very good start.
Gracious Heavenly Father...
I thank thee for
the White Way of Delight...
...the Lake of Shining Waters...
...the smell of the lilacs,
the sound of the spring peepers.
I could go on and on.
But what do I want?
Well, mainly two things.
Please let me stay
at Green Gables forever.
And please...
...let me be good-looking
when I grow up.
Your humble servant,
etcetera etcetera, Anne Shirley.
I think that was good,
don't you Marilla?
I could have made it more
flowery if I'd had more time.
And I probably should have said
Amen at the end. What do you think?
Do you think it will make
a difference?
I think we should get you
to church.
Etcetera etcetera.
Marilla found these for you.
They're lovely.
Not new but almost.
She thought one of them
might suit for church today.
...and you can wear the others
to school.
I'm going to school?
Marilla's having one of her
aches in the old noggin.
Dear. Is there anything I can do?
It would make her happy
if you liked these dresses. Do you?
I do...
...and I am ever so grateful but...
...I'd be so much more
gratefuller if...
...if just one of
them had puffed sleeves.
I have never heard of
puffed sleeves on a child's dress.
Puffed sleeves are
all the fashion now.
And it would be ever
so thrilling...
...if I could wear
a puffed sleeves dress.
Even just one time in my life.
I suppose you can take that up
with Marilla. And do so quietly.
And in the meantime, could you
chose one of these for church?
Marilla?
I chose this outfit
for church today.
That's good. It's plain and simple.
But...
...I was wondering if...
...if I can also have a dress
with puffed sleeves.
It would give me such a thrill.
You'll have to let go of
your thrills.
Puffed sleeves are a fad
and they look ridiculous.
I'd rather look ridiculous like
everyone else...
...than look plain and simple
all by myself.
Nonsense. Plain and simple is good.
Could you put that on my dresser?
Like a Royal Jewel.
What is that glorious stone?
It's an amethyst.
You can open up, if you like.
There's a picture inside.
Is that your mother?
She looks like you.
I guess, you look like her
is more correct.
Put that on my dresser.
Go on.
You're going to have to walk
by yourself to the church today.
It's not very far.
You're gonna be all right?
Yes, I love to walk.
Especially on a tree-lined
country road.
Although this will be my first
time I've actually ever walked...
...on a tree-lined country road.
Off you go.
Who is that?
That's the orphan with the red hair
I was telling you about.
What have she done to her hat?
Rachel said she nearly sank
through the floor when she saw you.
People are gonna think
that it's all my fault.
I'm sorry, Marilla. I didn't know
it was wrong to wear flowers.
It's not wrong, it's just...
Tell me child, do all of your
little friends behave like you do?
I've never had a friend,
at least not my own age.
You never had a friend? We'll
have to do something about that.
No reason to feel cobblesome.
Just don't use any of
your long words.
They'll think you're odd.
What if Diana doesn't like me?
My dear girl, it's Mrs. Barry
you have to worry about.
If she doesn't like you, it doesn't
matter what Diana thinks.
All right now,
you mind your Ps and Qs.
- Well now, good morning, Marilla?
- Hello.
- And you must be Anne.
- How do you do, Misses Bary?
Please.
Hello Diana.
Good afternoon, Miss Cuthbert.
Diana, this is Anne.
Anne, this is my little girl,
Diana.
How do you do?
Darling, why don't take Anne for
a nice walk around the property?
Yes, mother. Come.
My goodness, is she not the most
scrumptious little apricot?
Yeah.
Yeah.
My mother says
you're a strange bird.
I'd like to be a bird.
Sometimes you talk to trees?
I do as well. Of course, I know
it's only the wind in the leaves...
...but I like to think, well,
it's something else.
Let's pretend. I mean, together.
- Pretend what?
- Anything you like.
Do you want to see
my secret island?
Why's it a secret?
- Fairies live there.
- Really?
But you have to be very quiet
or you'll scare them off.
I know that.
- Shall we go?
- Yes!
Have you ever seen a fairy?
I did once, but I don't think
it had wings.
Only special ones have wings.
These ones have very soft voices.
Most beautiful place
I've ever seen.
Listen.
Diana? Would you like to be
my bosom friend?
I don't see why not.
- Will you swear to it?
- It's wicked to swear.
Not that kind of swearing,
the other kind.
What other kind?
Close your eyes.
I, Anne Shirley...
...do solemnly swear to be faithful
to my bosom friend, Diana Barry...
...as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.
Now you say it
and put my name in.
I, Diana Barry...
...do solemnly swear...
- To be faithful.
- To be faithful...
...to my bosom friend,
Anne Shirley...
...for as long as the sun
and moon shall endure.
Shoo!
Hello.
What's your name?
I'll call you Guinevre.
A picnic, huh?
That's something.
Yes. There's going to be...
...a rowing boat race
on McMurrich river.
...and three-legged race
on The Common.
And Mrs. Lynde is going to
make ice cream.
I've never tasted ice cream.
Diana tried to explain
that to me but...
Anne Shirley!
Have you seen my amethyst brooch?
Last time I saw it was...
I know, it was yesterday.
While you were away
at the your meeting.
I was passing your door
when I saw it...
...so I went in to look.
And then?
And then I took it up and I pinned
it on to see how it looked.
Then I put it right back.
- Put it back where?
On the bureau.
No, really, I put it straight back.
I believe you are telling me
a falsehood.
I swear, I didn't...
You go into your room
and don't you come out...
...until you are ready to confess.
Go on.
Marilla?
I took the brooch.
I didn't mean to,
but I was overcome...
...by an irresistible temptation.
I took it with me
when I went to Diana's...
...so I could play Lady Cordelia.
I thought I could put it back
before you came home.
But when I was crossing
the bridge...
...it slipped through my fingers
and dropped down into...
...the purple sparkling waves
and sank for evermore...
...in the Lake of Shining Waters.
Anne Shirley, you are the most
aggravating child...
...I have ever met.
I suppose I am.
And I know I'll have to be
punished.
But can you please get it over with
right away?
Because I'd like to go
to the picnic...
...with nothing on my conscience.
- Picnic?
It's tomorrow.
There'll be no picnic for you.
But that's why I confessed.
Marilla, please let me go.
Think of the ice cream.
I may never have a chance
to taste it ever again.
Ice crime? Do you have any idea
what that brooch meant to me?
Why do you always causing
so much trouble?
Red hair makes it easier
to be bad than good.
People who don't have it
cannot understand...
...what terrible trouble it is.
There'll be no picnic for you.
And that's final.
Josie, have you seen Anne?
I don't understand what you
see in her.
I mean she's just a charity case.
My mother said that as soon as...
...the Cuthberts find a home
for her, she'll be moving away.
Josie Pye, you are the meanest girl
on all of Prince Edward Island.
Dear life and heart.
Anne?
I apologize. I never should have
doubted your word.
And maybe you better go on comb
your hair and put on your gingham.
Go on, be quick about it.
Anne!
You came!
Come on.
That's Gilbert Blythe.
He teases all the girls.
So I can see.
But he's fair handsome,
don't you think?
Here you go.
Thank you, Mrs. Lynde.
It's my first time ever
in my life tasting ice cream.
Well?
Is it not scrumptious?
I would say...
...sublime.
Here, now. Stand still.
It has always been my deepest
desire to have an education.
Well, I'm sure you'll be fine
as long as you don't talk too much.
Bye, Matthew.
- Hardly seems possible
- What?
She's only been with us
four months...
...and it's like she's always
been here.
Stop your sentimental drivel.
It's unbecoming.
And don't you get to attached
Matthew Cuthbert.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Phillips.
- Diana, where do we sit?
- Don't worry.
- I'm so nervous.
- Come on.
Sit here. Sit here beside me.
Scholars! Up!
It fell out.
See what I mean?
Far too bold and poorly mannered.
Scholars! That's enough!
Show respect for The King!
God save our gracious King
Long live our noble King
God save the King
Send him victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
Good.
Hey, you.
Anne, hey!
- That's right.
- Ding dong.
Hello there, Carrots.
How dare you?
Hey, don't go haywire.
I was only trying to
get your attention.
You are a mean and hateful boy
and I won't ever forgive you.
What's this disturbance?
It's my fault sir. I teased her.
Thank you, Percy. Please sit.
Anne Shirley, come and stand
at the blackboard...
...and you will stay here
for the remainder of the day. Come.
I will control...
...my temper.
Read it, believe it
and then start behaving...
...like a civilized human being.
Do you understand?
Yes. But can I just say something
on my behalf?
No, you may not.
I'm sorry I made fun of your hair.
Honest I am.
- No, you're not!
Give me a chance.
- I won't. Not ever!
- Why's that?
Because I said I wouldn't
and I always keep my word.
- But that's not a real reason.
- It is to me.
Anne!
Why did you do that?
You could have injured him.
That was the point.
Gilbert Blythe hurt my feelings
excruciatingly.
I told you, remember?
Gilbert makes fun of all the girls,
not just you.
The cold iron has entered my soul.
I believe, for me, the pursuit of
education no longer has meaning.
Hello young lady.
How was school today?
I doubt I shall return.
Really? But why is that?
My honor has been tarnished.
Honor's a prize for fools.
Anne Shirley!
I have a meeting on
Saturday afternoon in town.
Why don't you ask
your friend, Diana...
...when you go back to school
tomorrow...
...if she wants to come over
and have tea.
Really, Marilla? Do you mean it?
Of course I mean it.
I never joke about anything...
...as important as friendship.
Miss Barry, do you come in.
My, what a lovely frock.
This? My morning dress.
In the afternoons I usually wear
blue satin.
The tea should be steeped by now.
Do you come in.
And pray, how is your dear mother?
Very well, thank you, though she
has a bad case of hives.
What was that?
Never mind.
Would you care for some fruit cake?
Marilla is an excellent cook.
Marilla?
My maid.
Holy cats. Marilla said
we could share some of her...
...raspberry cordial.
Be back in a jiffy.
That is to say,
if you'll be so kind...
...as to excuse me for a moment?
Of course.
That's an awfully nice raspberry
cordial, Miss Shirley.
Would you care for another drop?
I didn't know raspberry cordials
could taste so awfully nice.
But it is.
I'd have some myself
if I wasn't so full of cake.
Would you like another slice?
Are you...
Are you all right?
I feel rather coggly.
Sit down, I'll pour your tea.
I have to go.
Anne!
- In here!
- Anne!
Anne, I just had a talk
with Mrs. Barry.
She tells me that you are never
allowed to play with Diana again.
Why?
Apparently, she came home drunk.
Can you explain that?
- Drunk?
- What did you give her?
Just...
You said I could serve
raspberry cordial.
Show me the bottle.
Anne Shirley, you have
a genius for getting into trouble.
This is my red currant wine.
Could you not tell the difference?
I didn't taste it myself.
Marilla, what am I gonna do?
Diana is my bosom friend for life.
We swore an oath.
It's all right. There's no need
for tears.
I believe that you're
telling me the truth.
I'll go and speak to Mrs. Barry.
Don't worry about it.
Marilla!
Marilla!
Did you speak to Mrs. Barry?
Is everything all right?
Did she understand?
I tried to wait for you when
you got home but I fell asleep.
Diana's mother
had quite a lot to say about it.
She doesn't think...
Well, she feels that you're not
the fit companion for her daughter.
Why am I not a fit companion?
Believe me, Diana was just
as upset about it as you are.
It's not fair!
Matthew!
Matthew!
Here. Come on.
Get up.
- No.
- No, you are all right.
- I'm all right.
- Come.
Just a little dizzy spell.
Stop. Give me that. Come on.
Come.
Give us a nice breath.
One more.
Well, there is a little bit of
heart flutter there.
It's a warning. You're not
as young as you used to be.
Is there anything
you could do for him?
Try not to exert yourself
and avoid too much excitement.
It would be harder to find some.
Some truth in that.
Well, I gotta be going.
- Thanks George. So long.
- Your welcome.
Is he all right to be left alone?
I am not alone. Anne is here.
We're kindred spirits.
Your move.
Ruby Gillis says that
when a man is courting...
...he always has to agree with...
...the girl's mother on religion
and her father on politics.
Is that always true?
Well, I'm not so sure.
Your move.
Have you ever been courting?
Of course I did. But you know,
being a poor farmer...
...on the remote island,
possibilities were limited.
What about Marilla?
Did she ever have a beau?
Yeah, she did. Long ago
and it didn't work out I'm afraid.
But you mustn't bring it up to her.
What happened?
Well, as I recall, he was a
good decent fellow but...
...our mother didn't see it
that way exactly.
And that was that?
That was that.
Anne!
Minnie May has croup.
She's awful sick...
...and mother and father aren't
home and I need to get a doctor.
I'm so scared!
- Don't be scared child.
No. You stay there and stay warm.
I'll take care of it.
I've been around many babies.
Now, does Marilla have any Ipecac?
Yes, it is in the kitchen.
Over the stove.
Come on.
Anne, I'm so afraid
that she could die.
You go fetch Doctor Spencer.
Hello, Minnie May.
It's Anne. Do you remember me?
I'm Diana's friend.
I've come to help you feel better.
I need hot water
and some soft cloths.
Okay, Minnie May, I want you to
sit up and drink a little of this.
I don't want to.
I promise you will
start to feel better.
I don't want to.
I'll tell you what,
you drink a spoonful...
...and I'll tell you
a wonderful story.
Once upon a time there were
two beautiful maidens...
...called Geraldine and Cordelia.
Cordelia was dark-haired
with an alabaster brow.
Geraldine was blonde
with hair like spun gold...
...and eyes a velvety purple.
Purple? I like purple.
Me too.
Anne, someone here to see you.
Anne, dear.
Your quick thinking...
...may have saved
my little girl's life.
I think you are a wonderful
brave girl...
...and I hope that you and
Diana can still be good friends.
What do you say?
Mrs. Barry, I want you to know
I harbor no ill feelings of...
...any sort.
Thanks be to goodness for that.
Henceforth I shall cover the past
with a mantle of oblivion.
Thank you.
My Diana couldn't have
a more fit bosom friend.
Come now,
the barn is a little dusty.
Good bye, Marilla.
Say my best to Matthew.
Come on. That's it.
Come on.
Come on.
Marilla, I've milked the cow
and fed the chickens.
Please, may I go tobogganing
with my friends?
The sun's barely up.
Please. It's so beautiful outside.
Be home in time for dinner.
I will. Thank you!
Diana, wait!
What are you so owly about?
Did she say where they were going?
- Tobogganing.
- I know that, but where?
The best tobogganing hills are
around the Cochand's pond.
And the ice's certain spots are
so thin at this time of the year.
May be better hitch up Harry.
Come on, Harry.
Come on, boy.
Wanna see something strange?
- What?
- Come on, I'll show you.
- What's it?
- Upsidedown Man.
It's only a stupid joke.
Somebody does it every year.
- It's no joke.
- Of course it is.
Dare you to find out?
No, Josie Pye, we're not allowed
to pond. You know that.
It's been frozen solid for a month.
Josie Pye, don't you tell lie.
I'll do it.
No, You don't have to do anything.
Does so. I dared her.
So she has to.
It's all right.
Really, I don't mind.
Besides, every challenge
is an adventure.
Wow.
I can see all the way down
to the bottom.
It's wonderful.
It's like being in
a glass bottom boat.
Whoo Harry!
- Help!
- Oh my gosh!
Help, please! Get someone!
Anybody, get someone!
It's so cold, please!
I'm cold! I can't get out!
- Hold on!
- Get somebody!
- You kids, get back from the ice!
Get back!
- Get away!
- Oh my gosh! Please!
- Come on!
- Stay come now, Miss Anne.
- You're gonna be okay!
Please! Come faster!
I'm cold, please! Faster!
Matthew! Matthew, come on, please!
I can't get out!
I know! Please!
- Hang on there.
I'm stuck! Please!
Hold on, Kindred Spirit,
I'm gonna get you out.
I know, please!
Matthew, please!
Matthew!
Okay. Reach out.
I'm almost there.
Yes, girl, reach out!
Yes! Miss Anne with an "e". Yes!
Anne, what were you thinking
going out on the ice like that?
Imagine what would have happened
if Matthew hadn't sensed it.
And not just to you.
To him as well.
He shouldn't be doing dangerous
things like that at his age.
Of course it's not stopping him.
I was foolish Marilla.
I was. I know that now.
And I won't do anything like it
ever again.
All right, well. You're normal.
At least your temperature
seems to be.
Now, I want you to lie down.
I want you to not to imagine
things, not to be thinking...
...and I want you to try to
get some sleep. Can you do that?
- I will, promise.
- All right.
Where did you get them?
I pick 'em up now and then...
...whenever I go walking along
the sea shore.
They're beautiful.
Now, tell me all about
this concert of yours.
We're going to have six choruses
and Diana is to sing a solo.
And I'm to perform
as the Queen of the Fairies.
Josie Pye said she'd never
heard of a red-headed fairy...
...but I don't let myself mind
what Josie says.
Well, I reckon it'll be a darn
good concert.
You'll do your part just fine.
Look.
Can I show you?
Remember the dress I was telling
you about?
Diana already sent away
for one just like it.
Matthew?
Hello Rachel.
How are you doing?
Fair to middling. And yourself?
I'm all right. Marilla told me
you wanted to see me.
Well now, Rachel...
...I know I have not always been
the most sociable neighbor.
- There's a truth to that.
- I want a fresh start.
That's charming likely,
Matthew Cuthbert.
What you want is my help.
And for what, pray tell?
You know, I have always admire
your sewing skills.
Just try this.
Not the red balls.
Gold ones.
All right.
How are we doing in over here?
Yes, that's fine.
Diana, can you give me
another ribbon?
Give me that.
Why you're here?
For your safety.
Thank you, Gilbert.
Here, put that over there. There's
big space over there. You see that?
Excuse me, Anne.
Since the concert is tomorrow
I thought you like...
...your Christmas present early.
Matthew Cuthbert, what on earth?
I didn't want to bother you,
Marilla.
You get your hands full
all the time.
So, I spoke with Rachel.
So that was what all that
was about.
Yes, go on. Open it.
Matthew.
Yeah, this is a...
- It's a pintuck.
- Pintuck. And this is...
What do you call this?
- A ruffle.
- Ruffle. And those are the sleeves.
Puffed sleeves
you've always wanted.
I've never had a pretty dress
in my life.
Are you coming to the concert?
Well, you know, I read my bible
and say my prayers...
...but being in a small room
with a bunch of farmers...
...it's not my idea of
Christian fellers.
If it's all the same to you,
I would prefer to imagine it.
Thank you, Matthew.
Merry Christmas.
Now, go upstairs
and try it on, why don't you?
Matthew Cuthbert, sometimes
I think I don't understand...
...the first thing about you.
A young girl should have a
pretty dress in my opinion.
I believe that's the first
opinion you've ever had.
No. It's the first opinion I've
ever had out loud.
Merry Christmas, Marilla.
God bless you.
Merry Christmas, Matthew.
Yes, they worked hard.
I know, it's true.
I am sure it will be good.
You're right. Thank you.
Welcome to the concert
this evening.
Smile and flap your wings.
Just like that.
Come follow, follow me.
You, fairy elves that be...
...which circle on the green.
Come follow Mab your queen.
Good morning, Muriel.
Today's a borrowed day.
Yes, indeed. Spring has well
and truly sprung.
Rachel said there was something
here for me.
Indeed there is. From the
Presbyterian Orphan Homes.
Take a look inside.
They have already paid for
the train ticket.
It must be a shock to finally
have the whole thing done with.
I can't imagine your relief.
I got a letter from Mrs. Haines
in Charlottetown.
Remember, that Presbyterian outfit.
They've found a home for Anne.
They sent a train ticket.
When?
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
They says it's a real good family.
In Montreal. Very well off.
They've got four children,
all around the Anne's age.
It's the best thing for her,
Matthew.
It's a great opportunity for her.
Anne.
It's all right, Marilla.
Thank you for letting me stay
at Green Gables.
Even if it was just for a while.
I never felt truly at home
before this.
Good night, Marilla.
Good night, Anne.
Marilla?
Marilla Cuthbert, where are you?
Marilla?
Marilla?
Rachel, I was just...
Marilla. You know I'm the
last person to ever offer advice.
That goes without saying.
But I'm ordering you to go after
that girl and bring her back.
Mrs. Beatty has found her
a real family.
One that can look after her.
Aren't you a real family?
You and Matthew? You belong to her.
And she belongs to you.
Now you go after that girl
and bring her home, do you hear?
It's too late.
It's already set in motion.
Rubbish. It's never too late to do
the right thing.
Now, let's get going. Thomas is
right outside with the buggy.
So, a government fellow
from the Agriculture Department...
...was at post office
the other day.
We're talking about
this and that...
...I asked him about
what makes the roads red.
He told me it was the iron
what did it.
I found this very interesting.
Anne!
I know they've found you a
real good family.
And they're gonna be able to
give you lots of things that we...
...Matthew and me
couldn't provide.
But the fact is...
...we've come to think of you
as family.
And now, I can't imagine life at
Green Gables without you.
I don't want to imagine it.
So...
...how would you feel about
come and live with us...
...for good?
All right now, dear. All right.
Get control of yourself. All right.
Okay. Let's not overdo
the theatrics.
Anne of Green Gables!
Lights out, young lady.
Anne of Green Gables.
