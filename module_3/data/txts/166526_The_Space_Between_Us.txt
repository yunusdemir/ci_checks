NATHANIEL:
"I want to go to Mars.
"Not just to visit.
I want to live there.
"Because then
I'd be living proof
"that life on
Mars was possible.
"Proof that
if we had to,
"mankind could make
a fresh start.
"We're in trouble,
and it's our fault.
"And we're running out of time and
Mother Nature doesn't negotiate.
"We can't give up. Not now.
"Mars is a planet ripe
and ready for life.
"Earth's resources
may be depleted,
"but there's one resource
we must never neglect.
"It's the most valuable
"and it's the one
without limits.
"Courage."
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
I wrote those words...
I wrote those words
when I was 12 years old.
My letter to the White House.
Never did I imagine
the president
would read them aloud
to a nation
mourning the loss of yet
another crew of astronauts.
Never did I dream
that I would be proclaimed
an "Emblem of Fortitude,"
a "Young Man with
a Singular Vision."
And the rest is, well...
It's not history.
Just the beginning.
So, here we all are.
Thanks to Genesis
Space Technologies,
in 20 hours the Magellan-61 will
travel six astronauts to Mars,
not to visit,
but to live there.
The first true
citizens of Mars!
From a childhood vision
to the greatest space endeavor
the world has ever attempted,
the settlement known
as East Texas, Mars.
Come on, say it with me.
ALL: Just add water!
Yes!
Well, whatever I am,
I cannot begin to compare
to these six heroes,
living examples of
courage without limits.
And on that note,
I would like to
hand things off
to the mission head
of this historic expedition,
Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Sorry if we only have time
for a couple of questions.
You know what it's like
the night before a trip.
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
Scott Hubbard,
Aerospace Times.
Miss Elliot,
how does it feel to sacrifice the
next four years of your life to Mars?
It's not a sacrifice.
It's an opportunity.
I feel humbled, excited, and grateful
for the chance to be a pioneer.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Miss Elliot,
aren't you scared,
given the history,
given the dangers?
Of course.
I'm scared that I might let
the mission down in some way.
I was taught that people who took
risks without fear were brave.
Well, far braver are those that
take risks despite their fear.
Courage is fear that
has said its prayers.

You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Sarah, can I have a word?
What's up?
NATHANIEL: Show it to me.
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
(HEART BEATING)
(SIGHS)
We can't just turn the
mission around, correct?
Doctor,
how's she doing, anyway?
You mean, aside
from being mortified?
She's fine.
TOM: Oh, this is a disaster.
Nathaniel, she's due
shortly after they arrive.
We need to get out
in front of this.
An astronaut
behaved irresponsibly
and NASA will make a decision what
to do as soon as the baby's born.
Decision about what?
About when to bring them back.
Tom, there's
a bigger issue here.
Subjecting a fetus to zero gravity
during its entire gestation...
It's uncharted territory.
(SIGHS)
We do not go to press.
We keep
this internal for now.
We need to gather
more information.
What are you saying?
I'm saying,
we go short-term contingency.
We have Dr. Loh deliver
the baby on Mars.
We keep this quiet.
We wait this out.
Sarah may have
behaved irresponsibly,
but she's no longer
just an astronaut
and it's not just
a Genesis decision.
She's a mother now.
It's her decision, too.

Take it easy. Take him.
You got him? You got him?
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
GARY: Sarah, breathe.
She's still not responding.
Give her 20 milligrams of...
ASTRONAUT:

(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, Sarah, breathe.
ASTRONAUT: How long?
GARY: 30 minutes
without a heartbeat.
Stop. Stop.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
She's gone. She's gone.
She's gone.
Mr. Shepherd, are you there?
We lost her.
Okay. Here's what we know.
Two-thirds less gravity will alter
the child's internal organs.
The heart will simply not be conditioned
to have the strength to pump
in the Earth's gravity.
Bones will be brittle,
probably oversized.
The child would never survive
the trip back to Earth.
Yeah, but, Nathaniel,
in the eyes of the world,
isn't this whole mission,
East Texas, an experiment?
And wouldn't we be forgiven?
Experiment?
Tom, this isn't a mouse.
This is not a monkey.
This is a human being.
And in the eyes of the world,
the lead astronaut of
the Genesis Mars Mission
not only got pregnant,
but died in childbirth,
sentencing a baby to a motherless
existence in outer space.
Imagine the bloody outcry.
East Texas runs on money,
science, good faith,
and above all, good PR.
We're not only talking
about a secret,
we're talking
about a cover-up.
It will bring
the company down.
Unless.
TOM: Unless what?
Unless we don't cover up,
we take full responsibility.
We face it head-on.
Tom,
I wanna be on
the next mission.
As a passenger?
Yes.
Nathaniel, for the love of...
Oh, here we go.
No, actually, he's right.
There would be
no better show of support.
Thank you, Alice. Exactly.
You can imagine
their morale right now.
They've just
lost their leader.
TOM: Nathaniel,
it is out of the question.
And you know it.
Am I missing something here?
Doctor, will you
enlighten Alice, please?
Hydrocephalus.
We found it on Mr. Shepherd's
very first medical.
A congenital brain disorder.
It's basically benign.
Benign unless he wants to go into
outer space, and then nobody knows...
And what if I'm willing
to take that risk?
Sorry. Not happening.
So the child remains on Mars?
I don't...
We don't have a choice.
Say we come clean
and we lose our financing.
Say we give up
everything we fought for.
Say we bring everyone home.
You heard the doctor.
The child wouldn't
even make the trip.
Keeping this a secret
saves the company,
which saves East Texas,
which saves the child.
So the child
remains classified?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
Yes.

CENTAUR: Ha! There you are.
Centaur,
can you make me a map?
And what is it you'd like
a map of, Gardner Elliot?
A pathway through
the ventilation system
from my quarters to the storage
facility on East Texas.
And why would you
like that information?
That's none of your business.
It is my business.
I'm your best friend.
No. You're a machine with rudimentary
artificial intelligence.
A machine which
I helped to build.
That hurts my feelings.
You don't have feelings.
I do have feelings.
I'm your best friend.
I'm your teacher.
I'm your homie. Hug it out.
Get me a map of

By the way,
I can't reach Centaur.
What have you done

Are you checking up on me?
Here you go, Kendra.
Thanks, Tony.
No. I'm checking up

Yeah, who checks up on me.
You don't fool me,

You never have.
Okay. Uh, 23 should be clear.

Because misery loves company.
Why are you miserable?
Just dealing with the basic

You know, everybody's

Nobody's ever real,

Tell me about it.
Anyway, the second I turn 18,
I am so outta here.
Emancipation...
"Emancipation,

Are you making
fun of me, Gardner?
No, Tulsa. I just wish
I could go with you.
You've been saying that since last summer.
And you can.
No, I can't.
Oh, right. You can't
leave your house.
It's not a house, it's a
penthouse on Park Avenue.
I can't leave
because of my disease.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta.
TULSA: Yeah.
Still don't believe you.
GARDNER: Wouldn't your
foster dad be unhappy?
Yeah. No more checks
from the state.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGS) Study lab is over.
Gotta go.
See ya in
the funny papers.
What does that mean?
Hmm?
You always say that.
What does it mean?
I don't know,
I had a foster sister
in Oklahoma who used
to say it all the time.
Just a different way
of saying goodbye.
I like it.
Talk tomorrow?
I'm not going anywhere.

They're angels.
They look over the people on Earth

You could've caused

not to mention, died.
Nobody rides unaccompanied,

Gardner, what's going on here?
This isn't like you.
You wouldn't understand.
My mother's out there.
How did you get past
the electronic lock?
Okay, that magnetic implant is there
to monitor the growth of your organs,
not serve as a passkey.
And how did you even
learn how to do that?
Raised by scientists,
in a bubble.
Open.
That plaque for
your mother,
it's just a piece of

Her ashes were spread

You deserve to know that.
She's not out there,

She's in you.
I don't like to go to

We're not in a fight.
Okay.

This is how you greet
an old friend?
If he's unannounced, yes.
It's about the boy.
Mr. Shepherd, you have
no idea how smart he is.
He's being denied connection.
Not to do this,
at this point...
I'm sorry,
but it would be inhumane.
Miss Wyndham, I'm touched by
your concern, I really am.
But none of this matters
if he can't survive.
We've been through this.
For starters, we would have
to add carbon nanotubes
to strengthen
his bone density.
It's a very
complex procedure.
It's too risky. I'm sorry.
Tom, I can't sign on to this.
With all due respect, Nathaniel,
I'm not asking. I'm telling.
You've been gone

You've dropped off
the face of the Earth.
Have you run this by NASA?
NASA has always felt
conflicted over this.
They wanna do the right
thing, which this is.
They wanna bring
the boy home.
Look, this is our chance
to turn bad PR into good PR.
Wait a minute, this has
nothing to do with PR.
I'm talking about

Hang on, hang on.

TULSA: You're taking me

That was a joke.
As you were.
They may have found
a cure for my disease.
Okay, mine was closer

But mine is the truth.
It will involve
an operation.
And some physical therapy.
Pick it up,

You got it. You got it.
Keep going. There you go.
Remember what

Why'd you get divorced?
Well, he changed when we found

Uh, did that make you sad,
that you couldn't have children?
That's a tough one.
Meant I didn't have
to choose.
And, uh, motherhood wasn't a dream
I was chasing at that time.
My father is somewhere

We could go and find him.
We don't have
to tell him who I am.
I could just

Maybe I could
ask for the time.
No one has to know.
Do you know

No.

I don't know anything about him.
Nobody does.

You. You're very disarming.
Are you gonna keep going

What about blood?
Blood work is

But if we're going to be sure...
Virtually? Virtually?
Is that what we do
around here now? Virtually?
Because I like to think
the importance of our work
subscribes more to "definitely."

Run the test for

Because she's the only

Right. Read that to me.
Here she is. Uh...
She was left at the Tulsa,
Oklahoma Child Welfare Services

A girl named Tulsa happened

It's a nickname.
Right.

She know his story?
He told her he was confined

It's me.
It's Gardner.
Ow! What was that for?
Why did you
ghost me like that?
Ghost?
Yeah, you completely
blew me off.
You didn't return

I told you,
I was taking a trip.
For seven months?
People have phones, you know?
You can text, email.
I couldn't contact you.
It was a very
specific type of travel.
Very specific type of travel?
Who even talks like that?
Tulsa, can you slow down,
'cause gravity is very heavy.
Oh, I'm sorry that this is heavy for
you, but I really do not appreciate
being blown off by the one
person who I don't...
Tulsa, I would
never ghost on you.
Okay, I've actually gone through
quite a lot to get here.

MRS. TUPELO: Hello.
Hello.
And you are?
Gardner.
Are you a transfer student?
Okay.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Where are you from, Gardner?
East Texas.
MRS. TUPELO: I don't think
I have you on my roster.
Okay.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
All right, folks.
Telephone, phonograph...
(SOFTLY) I told you
to wait for me.
...movie camera,
light bulb...
I've waited long enough.
...were all inventions
of one father.
Who is he?
Thomas Edison.
Good. Give me one fact
about Thomas Edison.
The dude was bad-ass.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Edison wasn't a bad-ass.
Excuse me?
Edison invented
direct current,
but it was Nikola Tesla who
invented alternating current.
Edison got jealous and claimed
AC electrocuted pets.
To prove it,
he electrocuted an elephant.
That's not bad-ass,
that's a bad person.
(ALL APPLAUDING)
You see, folks? You learn
something new every day.
Thank you, uh...
Excuse me. That's our
emergency eye wash station.
(GROANS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Okay.
MRS. TUPELO: Oh, dear.
So the operation worked.
You're all better now?
Yeah. Yeah.
Tell me where
you're really from.
Mars.
You're from Mars?
Yeah.
All right, fine,
don't tell me.
Okay, look at this.
This is my mother.
She died.
I'm sorry.
What for?
It wasn't your fault.
It was mine.
I killed her.
But this is my father.
You're gonna help me find him.
I don't know
where he is, but...
Well, you have
your father's smile.
(CHUCKLES)
KENDRA: (STUTTERS)
I found the house.
Route 14, latitude 40,
34 longitude.
(GRUNTS) All right.
You stay here.
(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
(DOG PANTING)
NATHANIEL: Gardner!
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Gardner, you need
to come with me now!
No.
NATHANIEL: We're here to help!
You're putting yourself
in great danger!
Why can't you just
leave me alone!
This is my life!
Gardner.
Gardner, please.
Come on, just come with us...
I'm going to find my father.
GARDNER: He's all I have.
NATHANIEL: Is there
another way around?
That's not true.
You have me.
No, I don't.
Kendra, you told me yourself,
you don't want children.
Gardner, that's not what I meant.
You know that.
GARDNER: You never
wanted children.
And I'm sorry you had
to raise me at all.
(PANTING)
(GRUNTS)
(BARKS)
(KENDRA SHRIEKS)
NATHANIEL: Hey.
(GROWLING)
Yeah? I'll get the van.
You go.
Okay.
Go!
(BARKING CONTINUES)
TULSA: Duck!
Ah!
Sorry!
Okay. All right,
you're gonna need to get in.
Hurry! Come on!
(GRUNTING)
Gardner, let's go!
Go faster!
I'm trying to help him!
Just jump!
(GRUNTING)
TULSA: Come on.
All right, get in.
There you go!
There you go!
(CHUCKLES)
All right,
you may wanna hop in.
Whoo-hoo!
No!
Gardner,
take a seat, please.
Okay.
NATHANIEL: Gardner!
TULSA: There you go.
All right.
(SPUTTERING)
(TULSA GRUNTS)
Come on!
(TIRES SCREECH)
You know how to
fly this, right?
Nope.
GARDNER: Wow.
(GARDNER LAUGHS)
Whoa!
Oh, no.
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)
TULSA: Ah...
The pressure!
I know, right?
No, Gardner,
the oil pressure!
All right, I got 'em.
My God, they're
landing on a freeway.
TULSA: Okay. All right, um,
it's gonna be a little tricky.
I usually have
a landing strip.
Coordinates.
I need coordinates.
(HONKING)
GARDNER: Tulsa.
Tulsa, pull up! Pull up!
(TULSA GRUNTS)
(ENGINE SPUTTERS)
Ah...
(HONKING)
Brake! Brake!
TULSA: It doesn't
have brakes!
(HONKING)
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(TULSA SHOUTS)
Whoa!
We're gonna have to jump.
Let's jump!
(GRUNTS)
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH SHOUT)
Oh, no.
NATHANIEL: Oh.
No.
(CLATTERING)
TULSA: Holy crap.
All right, we gotta go.
Come on. Come on.
(HELICOPTER HOVERING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
TOM: No bodies.
KENDRA: What?
Are you sure?
Positive.
The fellas went through
the wreckage with
a fine-tooth comb.
They're alive.
Somewhere.
You had one job!
One job,
to protect Gardner!
To keep him from making contact
with the outside world.
Preventing exactly
this kind of eventuality.
You're hanging this on me?
(SCOFFS)
I admired you
more than anyone.
And you wanna know what?
We've been shouldering
East Texas for you.
For years.
What are you trying
to say, Kendra?
I'm trying to say the whole
mission was your job,
your responsibility.
You just gave up.
And where were you?
(MACHINES WHIRRING)
Hey.
(BANGING)
When's the Beemer
gonna be ready?
Later.
All right, well, can you
get the paperwork started?
Please.
Sir?
(SIGHS)
This is stealing.
TULSA: Yeah, whatever.
It's wrong.
How do you suppose
we find your father?
You got the paperwork
on this BMW?
Okay.
You know, right and
wrong seem to change
when you really
need something.
Don't worry, I'll get it.
(BEEPS)
All right.
TULSA: Friend of yours?
Where are we going?
Anywhere off the grid.
Disabling the phone.
(SIGHING) Okay.
So, uh, Gardner,
when you said that
you killed your mother,
what exactly did
you mean by that?
She died giving birth to me.
That doesn't mean
that you killed her.
So, who's that guy?
He founded East Texas.
Where I'm from.
Well, I thought you said
you were from New York.
Who was the woman? Kendra?
She's an astronaut.
Who you know from Mars?
Yeah.
You know what, get out.
Get out.
Get out!
I don't understand...
You know, I don't like
to be played, Gardner.
That's what it is. Mars?
Some weird disease?
People have been lying
to me my entire life,
which is whatever, 'cause people suck.
They suck. They lie.
They use you to
get what they want,
and then they just
throw you away.
And the thing is,
I didn't even like Calculus.
No, just Mr. Hall's
always drunk
and nobody can understand
what he's saying,
but he doesn't care
what we do on our computers.
Tulsa... So that's what
I looked forward to.
Tulsa, I'm not... To Calculus.
To talking to you.
So get out!
(EXHALES)
Tulsa, I'm not lying to you.
My mother was an astronaut.
She made a mistake.
I was born on Mars.
Just because people lied to you before,
it doesn't mean I'm lying now.
And just because something
sounds crazy to you,
doesn't mean it's not true.
So if you really wanna get rid
of me, you have to get out.
Because I'm gonna
find my father.
You know, when people talk to me
that way, they get their ass kicked.
Try it. I'm rockin'
this gravity.
Okay. Maybe you actually
believe it yourself.
(SIGHS)
What?
I'm sorry.
For what?
For people lying.
For people sucking things.
I'm sorry you're angry.
I'm not angry.
(GARDNER GRUNTS)
GARDNER: No.
Allow me, won't you?
What are you doing?
Chivalry's not dead.
At least not in Nantucket.
I'm on a road trip
with an insane person.
Whoa!
What is...
It's just a horse.
(BIKE ENGINE SPUTTERING)
(BELL JINGLING)
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, honey.
Let's go.
We should not
be doing this.
Well, we need a device
that's not being traced.
You wanna know where
your father is, right?
Okay.
Hey, it's unlocked.
Consider yourself lucky.
I consider myself
a criminal.
Okay.
Well, there was a Sarah
Elliot who was an astronaut.
Yeah.
I'll give ya that.
It says
she died tragically
from pressure suit failure
shortly after arriving.
Well, I'm a secret.
Yeah. Of course you are.
And I'm an enigma.
Same person.
GARDNER: I know.
That's what I've been...
TULSA: Damn it!
We lost connection.
Yup, they're
pretty cheap here.
Your best option is
disabling all the decoys
and piggybacking off
the firehouse next door.
Right.
Oh, cool. Thanks.
(CHUCKLES)
Pay for my wrap
and I won't tell.
No, no, no, we don't
have money. I'm sorry.
We have money.
Great. Why don't
you say that louder?
We have money!
No, no. Sorry, sorry,
he doesn't speak sarcasm.
Here, take it.
My mother was wearing this
when she died.
It's some sort
of ring, I think.
It's like half a ring.
Part of a bigger ring?
There's words on it.
Let's see.
These words are
in Havasupai.
An Indian tribe
in Arizona.
(TULSA READING)
Yup. It's signed.
Shaman Neka.
Gardner, I think this is
some kind of wedding ring.
And he married them.
That's Shaman Neka.
All right.
How far is Arizona?
Smile.
(CLICKS)
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
TULSA: Oh, no.
Oh, not smiling. Running.
Come on. Let's go.
Two teenagers
spotted last night.
We think
they're still in there.
(GIRL SCREAMS)
Where is he?
Sir, you gotta calm...
KENDRA: Stop it!
What have...
Let her go!
Hey!
OFFICER 2: We got him.
(GIRL WHIMPERING)
KENDRA: Are you okay?
Nathaniel. Nathaniel.
Talk to me.
What's going on?
You're right, Kendra.
I gave up.
I withdrew.
And the greater the pressure to
reemerge, the more I retreated.
As long as he was just a face, on the
screen, I could almost handle it,
sentencing a boy to a life
he never asked for.
But it's like the malignancy of any
secret, it just kept getting worse.
Every time I go over it, what
I did, the choices I made...
I swear, I couldn't
have done anything else.
But that's not the point.
I dealt with the problem.
I just had no idea what
the solution would do to me.
It killed me.
(STUTTERS)
And it's still killing me.
I need to make this right.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Yes.
Gardner's blood has elevated
levels of troponin.
The news is
not good, Kendra.
Thank you.
(SIGHS)
Talk to me about troponin.
What?
Elevated troponin
and Gardner.
Oh.
His myositic pool
was depleted.
I read the chart.
It's not necessarily
a problem on its own,
but in conjunction with
elevated levels of troponin...
He's suffering
from an enlarged heart.
His heart can't handle
our atmosphere.
Our gravity.
He's running out of time.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(LAUGHS)
Is that a balloon?
Tulsa, there's a balloon!
Yeah.
Tulsa, there's a balloon
up there!
All right, all right.
GARDNER: Wow, it's huge!
(GRUNTS)
Burgers and balloons.
You really gotta slow down.
That's your fifth?
(MUFFLED)
These taste so good.
(TULSA CHUCKLES)
Hey, uh,
can you check in there,
just see
if there's any cash?
In here?
Yup.
Cowboys always
stash away a few bucks.
No, that's for your mouth.
You just gotta blow in it.
No, you gotta... Yeah.
(PLAYING)
There ya go.
So cool.
(PLAYING)
Nice.
There ya go.
Uh...
You got schmutz
on your face.
All right.
Thanks.
Yeah.
All right. Go change.
Relax, this place has like a million
stores and a trillion dollars.
No, there are cameras...
All right,
all right, all right.
But, look, this is
the last of our money.
So, we'll buy the clothes,
then change.
Hey.
(PIANO PLAYING)
TULSA: (SINGING)
Break my heart
Break my hands
You can take anything
but my plans
I've got big things to do
You can laugh
Have your fun
I'll be standing right here
when you're done
Oh, oh...
I've got big things...
Yo.
Is that your song?
Maybe.
It's beautiful.
Whatever.
What goes on in there?
I don't know.
Got us some sleeping bags.
Ready?
Yeah.
Oh, and I'm driving
this time.
TULSA: (CHUCKLES)
In your dreams.
Excuse me, sir.
(TULSA SCREAMS)
Play that again.
They're moving aimlessly.
Why New Mexico?
Both hands on the wheel.
Both eyes on the road.
Dude, do you have a problem?
'Cause you've definitely been looking
at me for the last four hours
and it's starting
to freak me out.
You're so beautiful.
And then you blurt that out,
just like that? What?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?
Uh... Because you may wanna
just play it cool, you know?
Ease yourself
into the love game.
But I do think
you're beautiful.
(SCOFFS)
You're the most beautiful
girl I've ever seen.
Okay, just
slow your roll, kid.
You gotta calm down.
I don't wanna calm down.
And I don't understand why
this is making you so upset.
Hey, first of all,
I'm not upset.
I am uncomfortable.
There's a difference.
Secondly,
people don't go around
saying what they feel
whenever they feel it.
They have guards and shields
and other metaphors.
Why?
Because we're all messed up
and scared and trying to be
something that we're not.
And if we all went around just
declaring our innermost desires
to the exact people
we felt them for,
well, then we'd all end up
happy, or something.
Look, Gardner...
I'm happy that
you think I'm beautiful
and I've kind of had
an amazing time with you.
But the last thing I'm gonna
do is actually tell you that.
You just did.
You're blushing.
I'm not blushing.
Both hands on the wheel?
(STUTTERS)
No.
What is happening?
(SIGHS)
This is... I believe the
term is "euphoria."
TULSA: I got an idea.
(BEEPING)
(SWITCHING RADIO CHANNELS)
WOMAN ON RADIO: Hail in the southern
desert, extending from Las...
(MUSIC PLAYING)
Close your eyes.
How did you just become more
beautiful in 20 seconds?
Do you wanna kiss me?
Yeah.
But I don't know how.
You will.
You don't understand.
On Mars, people,
they didn't do this.
We just had scientists and
they studied ground samples.
Shut up, Gardner.
I thought about you
every day, up there.
I know
what's gonna happen.
What?
I'm gonna fall in love with
you and I'll fall to Earth.
(LAUGHS)
I'll be just like you.
That old line.
Okay, I'll shut up now.
No, no, no.
Hold that thought.
To myself?
All my life,
I couldn't feel anything.
I couldn't feel water.
I couldn't feel a fire.
I couldn't feel
wind on my face.
And now I can.
That's nothing compared to
what I feel with you.
I was so scared
I wouldn't know
how to be human.
You make me human, Tulsa.
(CHUCKLES)
(FIRE CRACKLING)
(TULSA PLAYING HARMONICA)
Well, that's incredible.
I know, right?
It has so many legs.
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
Everything's cool!
This is reservation property.
The tourist lookout
is 15 miles that way.
Yeah, we know. Um...
And we hope
we're not intruding,
but we're looking
for Shaman Neka.
Right on!
When you know, you know!
Know what?
I am not sure.
Come on!
SHAMAN NEKA:
I've married many couples.
Well, there were
no state records.
Um... Do you keep any?
I'd keep her.
What was her name?
Sarah Elliot.
Sarah.
So, I made this ring 16 years ago.
(SOFTLY) Stop. Stop!
The other half of this ring
is with your father.
This is the check.
It doesn't say his name.
No, she paid.
That's her address.
Do you have that photo?
Do you mind if
I borrow your computer?
Not at all.
Okay, great.
Okay.
Summerland, California.
(PAPER RUSTLING)
Huh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(TULSA CHUCKLES)
I think this is it.
Yeah, one second,
I think that's...
We found it.
(SNIFFLES)
Well, let's go.
(INAUDIBLE)
You look like crap.
You okay?
Yeah.
Do you know
where we're going?
Oh, yeah.
Paris, Venice,

TULSA: Hi. Uh, we just left
the keys in the ignition.
Checking in.
Thank you.
MAN: You're welcome.
Well, you wanted
to see the world.
Here you have it.
It's like a big toy.
(LAUGHS)
No, no, no, look.
That's Paris.
New York. Shanghai.
And look over there,
Venice.
It feels weird.
I mean,
it's not real, you know?
It's not
how I pictured it.
It's hurting my head
to see it like this.
Well, I'm sorry,
Gardner,
but the world doesn't always
give you exactly what you want.
It gave me you.
All right, let me be
cynical for one second.
(HORNS HONKING)
(BIKE ENGINE SPUTTERING)
Tulsa, just because
your parents are gone,
it doesn't mean
you can't have a family.
We can be
each other's family.
'Cause this isn't...
This isn't real,
but we can be real.
Okay.
I think it's time to go.
Let's get you to California.
You hear what I said?
Whoa. Yeah, I did. Uh...
But, Gardner,
I think you're sick.
None of this was how it was
in my head.
You need to
go to the hospital.
Except you. We need to
get you to a hospital.
Something's wrong with you.
Gardner. Gardner.
No, no! Gardner,
Gardner, Gardner!
You're okay,
you're okay.
Please help!
I wanna scan him.

Okay. Radiology, stat.

I don't know.
(MACHINE BEEPING)

Look at this.
I've never seen
anything like it before.
NURSE: Oh, my God,
what is that?
His heart is

I gave him
some valsartan, but...
It doesn't look good.
He wasn't lying.
Gardner.
Gardner, I have to go.
Social Services are coming.
But I'm gonna
go to Summerland.
I'm gonna find your father.
And I'm gonna tell him
how amazing you are.
How much you think about him
and how badly you wanted
to go there. Okay?
I promise.
Hey. Hey.
We need to go.
No, no. (SHUSHES)
We need to go.
You can't. You can't.
(GROANS)
You have to stay here.
Gardner.
Do you even know
why you're sick?
'Cause your heart's too big.
We are going to Summerland.
You can't.
They're gonna help you.
There's nothing they can do.
They can't. Don't you see?
No matter how much
I want Earth,
Earth doesn't want me.

I'll get my bag.

Gardner!
I'm not dead.
(SIGHS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Scared me.
You act like you hate
the world so much, Tulsa.
Save your strength.
It's all an act.
The beautiful music you make
gives you away.
Gardner, we're here.
Hey.
Hey, we're here.
Will you help me?
Yeah, of course.
Help you what?
Just look better.
Here.
(GARDNER BREATHING HEAVILY)
This is the best place
I've been so far.
You ready?
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)
He's gonna love you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hi.
Can I help you?
Now would be a good
time to say something.
Um...
Where did you get this photo?
East Texas.
That's impossible.
My mother was Sarah Elliot.
She died giving birth to me.
Sarah Elliot died
from pressure suit failure.
That's not... That's
what they said, but...
(MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY)
You're my father.
Is this some kind of scam?
No, he's not lying.
It's the truth, I swear.
I just wanted
to meet you.
(VOICE BREAKING)
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm not your father.
I'm calling the police.
Okay, just stay
right here.
Stop being a dick! Okay.
Look, he risked his life
to leave the one place
he's ever known, all alone,
didn't know anybody,
never set foot on this planet.
I mean, how scary is that?
What do you want from me?
I could never do that.
Look...
Just to meet you.
And he's dying.
I don't know who you are,
or why you're doing this.
I am not his father.
Well, then who are you,
because that is you in the photo,
and that is this house.
Yes, this is the house.
Our parents left it to us.
Sarah Elliot was my sister.
Oh. You gotta get some help.
Please, get some help!
Gardner!
Gardner!
Gardner!
Gardner!
No, he's not
your father.
He's not your father.
He's your uncle.
It doesn't matter anymore.
There's no time left, Tulsa.
Okay, let's just go back.
He's gonna call the ambulance.
You'll get better.
My mother's here.
I can feel her.
I didn't get to choose
where I was born.
But I get to choose
where I die.
(TULSA SHOUTS)
Tulsa.
Yes, Gardner?
What's your favorite thing
about Earth?
You are, Gardner.
See you in the funny papers.
Gardner! Gardner!
No, no! Gardner!
No, Gardner!
No, Gardner, no!
No, Gardner!
I got him!

Let's move him over.
KENDRA: There we go.
NATHANIEL: Turn him over.
Come on.
(COUGHING)
KENDRA: Okay, come on.
NATHANIEL: Gardner.
You can do it.
Gardner! Gardner!
(CONTINUES COUGHING)
Gardner, stay with me.
Don't leave us!
Come on. Come on.
What was she like?
My mother.
She was fearless.
She was kind.
And she just
seemed so invincible.
And she made me wanna
give up living when she died.
You loved her.
Yes.
You're my father.
Yes.
(AMBULANCE WAILING)

(EKG BEEPING)
KENDRA: It's taking too long.
His blood pressure's
dropping.
We have to get him
out of our gravity.
You have to take
the plane higher.
Do you understand
what I'm saying?
You know I can't do that.
That's against
all regulations.
I'm taking control.
What are you doing?
I'm taking us into
the stratosphere.
Excuse me?
(GRUNTS) Yeah, don't worry.
She can handle it.
Although I warn you, one of
you may need to take over.
One of us may need to...
Yeah, there's a chance
that I may die.
But you've done this before?
Yes.
All the time.
Virtually.
Great.
Buckle in.
All right,
let's buckle you in.
Uh... Yeah, just get ready.
Come on.
Grab this strap
right there.
I have the aircraft.
(LOUD RUMBLING)
(GRUNTS)
No, we gotta go higher.
(BEEPING)
Try and wake him up.
Gardner. Gardner,
wake up! Gardner!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Stay in. Stay in.
I've got him.
(SIGHS)
Are we on my planet?
No.
Are we on yours?
No.
Are you ever gonna
stop slapping me?
You have to go back.
No, Tulsa, don't...
I hate it. I hate it.
But, Gardner, we both know
you have to go back.
I love you, Tulsa.
And I love you.
How's he doing?
Stable, for now.
It should buy us
the time we need.
And you? You okay?
Apparently.
This is good to know.
Uh-huh. (CHUCKLES)
I'm gonna miss you, Gardner.
More than anything else
in the world.
Me too.
You're the best mom
I never had.
(LAUGHS)
Safe travels, okay?
Oh, miss. Hold up, miss.
Hey!
Miss, you can't
go up there.
Nice ride.
Are you gonna be okay?
You're amazing.
And I had the time
of my life with you.
(CHUCKLES) But the last thing I'm
gonna do is actually tell you that.
(CHUCKLES)
You just did.

GARDNER: Same time tomorrow?
Works for me.
Tulsa.
You have a visitor.
Um...
Bye.
Gotta go.
Hey.
Hi.
(KENDRA CHUCKLES)
So, as you probably know,
I've retired from NASA.
Well, not really.
(STUTTERING) I'm running
their training program now.
And it's been great.
I mean, getting re-accustomed to living
on this planet's been a little trying.
Anyway, um,
I'm getting off track. Um...
Since I couldn't
spend any money on Mars,
and I was up there
for six years,
it turns out
I actually have a lot of it.
So, I bought a ranch house
in Boulder, Colorado.
Mmm. I like to ski and the
people are really nice.
Yeah, it's a pretty big house.
Gets lonely at times.
Would you like to
come live with me there?
Are you getting paid?
To take me?
Oh, God, no.
No.
'Cause I age out
in a month.
Who said anything
about only a month?
(INAUDIBLE)
GARDNER:
I wanted to go to Earth.
Not just to visit,
but to live there.
It turns out,
people from Earth
want exactly the same thing
as people from Mars.
And I should know, because I'm
pretty sure I'm the only one.
So far.
I don't know which is better,
but here's what I do know.
It's good to be home.
