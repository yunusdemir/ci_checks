Danyu!
The grasslands have not seen
such activity in a long time.
This time when we plunder
the Central Plains,
we are able to join forces
with all nine major tribes.
Such military power
has never been seen before! Come!
- Drink!
- Let's drink!
Father.
Mendu is not yet here?
Elder Brother says
he's releasing the captives.
Releasing the captives?
- Let's fight them!
- Don't!
- Ashina!
- Sir!
Kill them!
Stop!
- Danyu!
- Danyu!
Brother! Is killing defenseless
prisoners the act of a hero?
They are all sheep
already in my mouth.
I will eat them
however I please.
Our days are numbered.
We must be back
on the grasslands
by the first snow.
Father, plundering the Plains every year
is not a long term plan.
Instead of being divided and defeated
by the Wei army for robbery,
why don't we take advantage
of the united forces we have,
and turn the fertile Wei farmlands
into our new ranch!
Of course, it is all up to you,
for you are the true master
of the grasslands.
Mendu! Don't kill any more prisoners!
Sir!
Only veterans understand
that there are no heroes
on the battlefield,
only dead men and crazy ones.
Talking about feelings?
Fools!
But if it wasn't for you,
none of us would be here.
You are the one who
lives by his feelings!
Father, time for your medicine!
I don't want medicine,
I want to drink wine!
Sure. Let me pour for you.
Here!
I don't want this one, l want that one.
It's still medicine!
Go for the weakness,
use the enemy against himself.
Mulan is using battle
tactics on her father!
It's all your fault!
Why did you teach her kung fu?
Waving her stick around all day.
She's a girl!
Who will marry her?
- Grandfather!
- Hi, Tiger!
Sister Mulan!
- When did you last practice kung fu?
- I practiced yesterday and today!
I didn't see you, when did you practice?
From when the cock started crowing
to when it stopped,
so it counted as both days!
You brat!
The Rourans are at our border.
Troops are needed to defend our land.
Military families from all villages.
Heed the Emperor's command!
Farming families contribute food.
Military families contribute men.
With united spirit,
we will defeat the dog invaders!
- Cao Dayou!
- Here!
- Hua Hu!
- Here!
Father! You're
ill, you can't go!
No way! This is a
military family's duty!
- Yang Ji!
- Here!
- Yang Wencai!
- Here!
- Ma Wen!
- Here!
Old partner,
it's our turn to go to
the front lines again!
Father,
have some more wine.
I have some money stashed away
in the jar under the bed.
Master Ho found you a husband.
Get married after the new year.
Don't do martial arts any more.
You're a girl.
One day,
you will find a new star in the sky.
That will be me.
Your mother's been up there for so long,
she must be lonely.
- Mulan! Help me!
- Here l come, Tiger!
I have failed to discipline my daughter;
I apologise for her.
The Hua family has only known
how to fight in battles!
If you want to fight,
be a man in your next life.
Our rules:
Stealing from each other, death penalty!
Bullying, raping,
bringing women into camp, death penalty!
Spreading rumors of ghosts
and witchcraft, death penalty!
Fear and running away for no reason,
death penalty!
Missing signals, sleeping other than
where assigned, death penalty!
C company! Get 60,000 stone
of food from Tu Family Village! Go!
Remember, these tags
must always be kept on you.
They will represent you
when you are dead.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!
- Names.
- Fei Tiger.
Hua Hu's son, Hua Mulan.
- Pay attention!
- Thank you!
Get your uniforms and go to Tent Three.
Hua Mulan?
Yes.
You! Why are you here?
- I took my father's place.
- You didn't!
Tiger! Tiger!
Tiger!
Women are not allowed in camp.
It's punishable by death!
Are you trying to destroy
our whole village?
So you must keep our secret.
You want me to go and see
my dad sooner, don't you?
Tiger, you must help me!
You know my dad,
he would never survive this!
But...
Fei Tiger! Come here!
Will you do as l ask?
Sure!
I knew you would do this!
I will do anything you ask,
but you must do as l say on one matter.
- Talk less, laugh less.
- Why?
You laugh like this...
We laugh like this...
- Also, don't open your eyes so wide!
- Why not?
- Our eyes are not that big!
- You mean, your eyes are small.
Your eyes are too big!
Hey!
From now on, you must all obey me!
Brother Tiger!
I heard he's the Commander's nephew,
Hu Guei.
- Bai!
- Brother Tiger!
This is Mulan.
- Scholar! Fatso!
- Brother Tiger!
This is Mulan. Come.
- Hulu! This is Mulan.
- Hello, Brother Mulan.
- We want to trade beds with you.
- Why?
Mulan likes quieter
spots against the wall.
Sure.
Sit down, gamble with Young Master!
I need a leopard! Bring him! Kill!
Out of the mud from the Grey,
comes a turtle called Hu Guei!
- Let's call him Turtle from now on!
- Yes! We'll call him Turtle!
Training is over. Go back to your tents!
Black Wind!
Will Father blame me
for leaving without saying goodbye?
All the crooks and heroes in the camp,
officers protecting their own,
with Father's temper,
he couldn't take it.
Right?
Wrong!
You're a rookie? What's your name?
So...
. .you only talk to horses?
But l don't eavesdrop.
Then think of me as a horse. I’m Wentai.
My horse is Moon Chaser.
What's yours called?
- He is Black Wind!
- Black Wind.
- And you?
- I’m Hua Mulan.
What a great horse!
Help me! Come here!
My horse is amazing.
- Lt is a war hero!
- Really?
- Do you know what it is called?
- What?
Hua Mulan.
Come, Wentai!
Come, Hua Mulan!
- Brother Mulan!
- This is Wentai.
- I’m Tiger.
- I’m Wentai.
- I’m older brother Fatso.
- I’m younger brother Hulu.
- Hello!
- I’m Scholar.
Hello!
- What are you painting?
- My wife.
You're already married?
I thought you were painting him!
I am the only son in my family,
so Father let me marry young.
Paint my picture!
Should l smile or not?
Just as you are!
Crying again? You're
an enlisted man! So
you'll die. Why are
you always crying?
Bai here sold himself
to the landlord next door
to enlist in place of his son,
in order to raise money
for his mother's medicine.
But she is still sick.
I lost again! You bastard!
You cried away my leopard!
What are you crying for!
Did your mother die?
What did you say?
Do not talk about my mother!
What are you doing?
Sir, please spare my life!
If you must fight,
do so on the battlefield!
My Brother Mulan!
My father is sick, too.
But we can't go back!
Your mother knows what a good son
you are. She will wait for you!
Brother Wentai I’m done!
Thank you!
Repel!
Advance!
Attack!
You're killing me!
Advance!
Attack!
Repel!
Advance!
Attack!
Repel!
Advance!
Attack!
Repel!
Attack!
Tiger, didn't you say
you found a hot spring?
Take me there!
Which battalion do you belong to?
I’m talking to you!
A woman?
Tiger!
I ran into Wentai!
How did you do that?
I fought with him in the hot spring!
Did he recognise you?
- I think he just knows it was a woman.
- Well, then... go to sleep...
Get up!
Fall in!
Uncle, it was stolen
when l was training with them!
The Prince Regent's
jade belt pendant has been stolen!
Return it now, l'll
only cut off your hand.
If I find it on you,
I'll cut off your head!
Search them!
Strip down!
Now! Hurry! What are you looking at?
Strip down!
Hurry! Quit messing around!
Strip down now!
You! What are you waiting for? Hurry!
Yes, you! Now!
Hurry!
All clothes off!
Strip down!
You in the back! Hurry!
What are you waiting for! Pants off!
Take it all off!
Clothes off! Hurry! Strip down!
Strip down! Strip down!
I stole it!
Bring him here!
Where is the pendant?
- I lost it.
- Lost it?
He must have sold it!
Where is it?
- I don't know.
- Take him out to be executed!
Commander,
we should investigate this first!
The execution is tomorrow at noon!
Where can it be? What am l to do!
I know you didn't steal the pendant.
What's going on?
My father is very sick,
so l dressed up as a
boy to take his place.
How can l help you?
Please,
don't let him know
I didn't
die in combat!
Have some soup.
From the day l entered the camp.
I’ve had nightmares every night.
Please,
personally burn my corpse.
Don't let anyone else find out!
I promise to burn your nightmares.
Thank you.
- Leave us!
- Yes, sir!
It's a Rouran attack! Get out!
Run!
How will you justify letting me go?
This is war. There aren't
so many consequences.
Go!
Commander!
Thank you!
Mulan! Mulan!
Charge across! Kill their General!
Kill him!
Chop off his head!
That's an order!
The Rouran General is dead!
Kill them!
Retreat! Now!
Hurry! Bring him here! Now!
Stay calm!
- Prepare the bandages!
- Yes, sir!
Uncle!
What shall l do without you?
You still have us.
Come on.
Salute!
A century of human life is like a dream.
Life and death occur,
heroes have no regrets.
Protect my homeland,
show off my nation's pride.
What joy is there in life...
Mulan, you can be a talented general!
I'll keep your identity secret.
Stay on.
I don't want their families
to feel even worse when
they see the blood.
Come!
I’m actually very afraid of blood!
My father dislikes me.
He said l wouldn't
amount to anything since
I couldn't even bear
to kill a rabbit,
and kicked me out of the house.
You weren't afraid,
you just couldn't bear to do it!
You're right.
So I worked hard to excel,
so I could show him.
I used to hate him,
but now l understand
he was just training me.
I have my own way.
I imagine my fear is a person.
Then I shout at him,
I’m not afraid of you!
And I’m not!
I’m not afraid of you!
What did you say?
Nothing!
In the third year of our Emperor's rule,
our nation lost a hero.
Commander Feng died for the country.
The Emperor commands Wentai
to be Commander,
Hua Mulan to be Sub-Commander,
and hopes they will lead the 6th
Battalion to serve the country.
The Rouran Prince Mendu
has gathered all the tribes.
I fear a major battle is imminent!
I hereby command all
battalions to attack
to weaken the Rouran forces!
Go forth!
Big Brother!
The Emperor commands that,
for their wartime accomplishments,
Wentai is to be made
General of Conquering North.
Hua Mulan is to be made
General of Pacifying North,
and hopes these heroes
will fight to protect our homeland!
I finally understand
why Father said
we must not have feelings
on the battlefield!
We were rewarded and made Generals,
but who will reward them?
When l was a child, Father said
that when people die,
they will become stars in the sky.
Danyu! Wei generals Hua Mulan
and Wentai soundly defeated Bawuyi!
Hua Mulan and Wentai again!
So the Wei nation still has
generals as fierce as tigers!
Father.
A wolf can kill one sheep.
But ten wolves can eat a tiger!
I beg you not to split
our forces again!
The Rouran nation
was established 150 years ago.
We have fewer and fewer tribesmen.
It's a hard life.
Father.
I want to be a queen of Wei.
If I were queen, we could become friends
with the Central people.
We could trade our pelts and horses
for their salt and iron.
Wouldn't that be good?
If you didn't have an older brother,
you would be the future Danyu,
Master of the Grasslands.
Danyu!
Child, l gave you your freedom long ago,
yet you stayed to be
with me all these years.
I hope, when l die,
to be buried to the
sound of your singing.
Then you should bring
your tribesmen home.
The Rourans should have a friend.
General Hua!
General Wentai was ambushed
when he was scouting up ahead.
He orders that you
remain here to await
his command, and
guard the supplies!
Scholar!
- General?
- Stay here. Guard the supplies!
- Yes, sir!
- All cavalrymen, come with me!
General Hua! General Wentai asked you
to remain where you were!
All supply wagons, go over there!
Retreat!
Don't chase them!
- Why are you here?
- L was worried about you!
Let's go!
General Hua,
as soon as you left, we were ambushed!
Scholar!
Scholar! Hang on!
Hang in there. Scholar!
Your wife is waiting
for you at home! Hang on!
I’m not married.
Before l left
I promised my father when l went back
 would give him a grandson.
General!
I failed to protect the supplies. Sorry!
Bring me back to my father.
I’m sorry.
Scholar! Scholar!
Scholar!
I’m sorry.
- Where are you going?
- To find them!
Your emotions during the battle,
caused the death of so many of our men,
can't you see that?
It's all my fault!
It's all on me!
I shouldn't have gone to you,
but l was terrified
that you wouldn't come back.
I’ve lost so many brothers,
l couldn't bear to lose you!
Your father was right.
There can be no love in war.
If you were me...
. .wouldn't you have come?
I wouldn't have.
Why was Father
so excited to talk about war?
I’ve fought battle after battle,
lost one after another of my brothers.
I really don't want to fight any more.
Everyone is awaiting their General
to lead them to battle!
I don't want to fight any more.
I don't want to be a General.
I want to be a normal person!
Nobody wants to fight!
I don't want to fight any more either!
If l could use my life to stop this war.
I would have done it long ago!
The problem is, we cannot choose!
Once you put on a General's Armour,
your life is no longer your own.
This is what war is about!
Stay.
Just this once!
Ambush!
Brother Wentai!
General!
Before Brother Wentai died,
he asked me to give you this
and tell you to never give up.
If we steal and drink the army's wine,
we'll be whipped!
We won't. Who rules over us now?
True. General Wentai is gone,
and General Hua
has not trained us in a long time.
Don't worry, drink up!
- General Hua!
- General Hua!
- OK, we're fine.
- See, l told you no one cares!
Keep drinking!
Sir, General Hua
has not trained us in a long time.
The General has ordered
training to cease.
Let's train together! Get up!
What's the use?
The General doesn't care any more.
Do we still have a General?
- What did you say?
- Turtle!
Let's train by ourselves!
What are you doing?
Give it back!
Are you living for the
dead or for the living?
Give it back!
There are things you must do!
Lt is your duty!
You are no longer the
Sister Mulan l adored!
Because you wanted to leave,
you caused the death of Brother Wentai.
And you will cause the death
of many of our brothers in the future!
You are so selfish!
He really wanted to see you
become a good leader.
If he saw what you have become,
he would be so disappointed!
Tiger!
Fall in!
The General Hua you see before you
is actually terrified of battle.
I had been afraid and hiding all along.
But...
l never thought my fear and hiding,
would cause the loss
of the most important friend in my life.
His departure lets me understand
fleeing from the endless battles
only makes us lose even more!
From now on, l will become stronger,
and protect each one of you!
And you must all become stronger
to protect those near you!
Will you do that?
Hail, General Hua!
Hail, the Wei army!
Hail, General Hua!
Hail, General Hua!
Brother Wentai!
No matter if l live or die,
tell Mulan l have died!
Her emotional tie must be cut
before she can really grow strong.
- Promise me!
- OK.
Ln the sixth year of the Emperor's rule,
General Hua led 5,000 soldiers
to lure the Rourans across the river.
He ordered his men
to destroy a dyke upstream.
Countless enemy soldiers
were washed away.
He killed 10,000 of the enemy
with no loss of life!
Ln the seventh year,
he chased the enemy for 300 miles.
Lt was snowing.
The enemy thought we had retreated.
But General Hua
disregarded the hardships
and tracked them down
to their hiding place,
attacked when they
were unprepared,
killed 20,000, and
took 3,000 prisoners!
The Rouran quake
at the sound of his name!
Also, when General Hua
goes to battle, he
always stands in front
of his soldiers.
His men are so moved,
they will gladly die for him!
When he sees other battalions in
trouble, he will always help them.
So among the Wei army,
he inspires confidence,
and is well-respected.
Ln the eighth year,
General Hua led 3,000 men...
Enough!
Say no more. Demoted
to the cooking team!
Why are you demoting
General Hua to the cooking team?
I meant you!
- Remove him!
- Yes, sir! Commander-in-chief, sir!
We can have wine if we win! Come!
General Hua! You are a great guy!
- L want to be your sworn brother!
- Sorry, General Hua! He's drunk.
General Hua, I’m not drunk!
General Hua!
Let's tell her the truth.
No!
Now the army's morale is strong
and it all hinges on her!
I always hoped...
. .her heart would harden, and not
be bothered by matters of emotion.
As long as the Rourans live,
we don't have a home.
That's more important than us.
You two are so lonely!
Chiefs Futu, Shelun
and Buluzhen are outside,
waiting to bid farewell
to Your Highness.
Your Highness!
My tribe lost badly in
the Battle of Buhe.
We wish to return to the grassland
to rest and recover!
I gathered everyone this time,
not just to loot and plunder!
With the Donghu, Dayue
and Dawan tribes together
we can attack and claim
the Central Plains.
Forever leave the frigid north,
and realise the dreams of the Rouran!
Now l need everyone to be united.
What do you think?
The Old Danyu is kind,
and has permitted us to depart.
Yes, Your Highness!
Come! Bring the wine!
My father is kind.
And you have worked very hard!
Futu, you have worked hardest,
l will see you off first.
Thank you, Your Highness!
Who will be next?
Father!
Futu was talking the other tribes
into retreating, so l killed him.
Child! L know you are unhappy,
having run around the
grasslands for so
long, trying to gather
all the tribes.
Father,
my life was given to me by you.
I will not speak of unhappiness.
Morale is too low now,
they cannot take another battle.
We must preserve the Rouran bloodlines.
When you are Danyu you will understand.
But l am not content!
With our strength, we might not lose.
That means we also might not win.
Let us retreat.
Father,
do you remember what you used to say
when l was a boy and would ask you
why we always loot and plunder?
We Rourans don't have iron.
Why do we need iron?
To make weapons.
Why do we need weapons?
So we can loot and plunder!
Yes, Father.
I think like my sister.
I also dream of a day
when we can finally stop
looting year after year,
and live the abundant
life of the Wei people.
As long as we take the Wei territory,
l will fulfill my responsibility.
Father,
you should agree with me, right?
Danyu, it has been polished.
Gude, stay and serve me!
My father's soul has risen to the sky.
From today on, l, Mendu,
am your new Danyu.
- Danyu!
- Danyu!
Your mother's family name is Yuguo.
We must marry in the future,
to give birth to the most
purebred Rouran child
who shall rule the earth!
Mendu of the Rouran
has become the new Danyu.
He has gathered an army of 200,000
and is ready to strike south.
What do you think, Generals?
Commander-in-chief!
I have fought with Mendu before.
He is cruel and violent.
We cannot go against his 200,000 troops
with our meager forces.
We could retreat, defend
the gateways, and
wait for them to come.
What do you think?
Commander-in-chief!
If we retreat, morale will drop.
And if Mendu pursues us at this time,
we will suffer great losses.
I beg you to consider,
we must not retreat!
I beg for your command
to lead the front line troops!
General Hua,
you are so loyal and courageous.
What is your strategy?
Normally, we confront
with the main troop and win by surprise.
Normally, we would confront the enemy
with the main troop.
While a secondary troop hides in ambush.
But this time l want
to do the opposite!
I will lead the
confrontation troop,
while the Commander-in-chief
leads the main as a surprise.
As long as l have a small victory
at the start and anger Mendu.
Thus luring him to chase us
with all his might,
l will pretend to be
trapped in a canyon.
Mendu will think they can butcher us.
Commander-in-chief will be
in ambush behind them.
And as soon as the enemy turns around
please release smoke,
l'll turn and lead my
troops into the fray
so they will be attacked
from the front and rear!
Good! L will give you
a troop of 20,000.
Commander-in-chief.
Speed is of the essence,
l wish to depart tonight.
Please place supplies
in the canyon for our use.
- We will go according to this plan!
- Yes, sir!
Thank you, sir!
I am General Hua Mulan
of the Great Wei Nation.
Has your Commander-in-chief
become a shrinking turtle,
and sent a peon like you to your death?
This is the territory of the
Great Wei Nation. Please leave!
But l like your territory!
Remember, Wei people are sheep,
we Rouran are wolves!
Steady!
We have Han, Shi,
Xianbei and Jiang men,
but no sheep!
They have 20,000 men.
L'll give you 40,000 men and 4 hours.
- Destroy them!
- Yes, sir!
Hail! Hail!
Make ready archers!
Shoot!
- Kill!
- Kill!
Make ready!
Stop them!
Danyu! Wei General Hua Mulan
defeated us!
What do you mean "defeated"?
Hua Mulan!
Mobilise all my troops!
They fell for it!
Main cavalry unit,
put the front team in the back.
Cover the troop's
retreat to the canyon!
Yes, sir!
Protect the General!
General!
- Run!
- Hurry!
Run! The Poison Dragon is coming!
Retreat!
Mulan!
Mulan?
Hua Mulan!
I knew you didn't die!
Mulan!
- Get the medic!
- Yes, sir!
Hang in there.
Mulan! Hang in there.
The Rourans are coming!
General, the Rourans are coming!
Company retreat!
General! Lf we take our wounded,
we may jeopardize our plan!
Company retreat!
- General!
- Mulan!
Mount!
Company retreat!
Brothers!
Let us use all our power
to help our General retreat, all right?
Yes!
General!
- Seal the canyon opening! Now!
- Yes, sir!
- Check our supplies in the canyon!
- Yes, sir!
Mulan! Sit down.
General, the medic and
all the medications
disappeared during
the Poison Dragon!
Stop!
Danyu! Why do we not pursue
while we are victorious?
Destroy Hua Mulan first,
then go after Zang Zhi!
Where can he go from here?
They're trapped!
Danyu, you mean...
Killing can be done in an instant.
I like to watch people in desperation,
especially Hua Mulan!
General Hua!
We have made a thorough search,
but have found no supplies
or water in the canyon.
Gather and redistribute
the available supplies. Kill the horses.
Kill the horses!
- Keep their blood for future use!
- Yes, sir!
The Commander-in-chief's smoke
will be our last hope.
If l die before it comes,
lead our brothers in defense for me.
I’ve watched you over all these years.
You've done a great job!
I dreamed that I’d died.
You'd all left me.
There was no one around me.
I count the stars every night.
There is not an extra one,
so you won't die.
You're so good to me!
General!
Cry out!
Cry to your brothers for help!
Get them to help you! Cry out!
Cry for your General to save you!
Cry out!
General, l beg you to save them!
I won't allow you to be sacrificed.
But General! That's Tiger! Your brother!
You are all my brothers!
We must wait!
Hu Guei, don't fall for their trap!
Tiger!
Turtle!
Tiger!
Turtle!
A century of human life is like a dream.
Life and death occur,
heroes have no regrets.
Protect my homeland,
show off my nation's pride.
What joy is there in life,
what regrets in death.
There are enemy winds up north,
but home fires down south.
I miss my wife and
children, and my home.
They are across the
mountains, far away...
- Ashina!
- Yes, Danyu!
A century of human life...
lf they don't come out, kill them!
Is like a dream.
Life and death occur,
heroes have no regrets.
Protect my homeland,
show off my nation's pride.
What joy is there in life,
what regrets in death.
Tiger!
There are enemy winds up north,
but home fires down south.
I miss my wife and children...
and my home.
They are across the
mountains, far away...
Finally, peace and quiet!
We are out of supplies
and can no longer hold our position.
The Commander-in-chief
is really not coming.
If we do not get medication,
you and the brothers
won't be able to hang on.
Even if l die,
lf l must die on the battlefield!
Will you go with me?
I will!
Wentai!
You are the one person
l will never forget!
Heroes!
Our troops were stationed here
originally to meet up with
the Commander-in-chief and his troops!
But...
he betrayed us!
Today, we will stain
the battlefield with our blood.
Behind us is our homeland.
If we have to bleed out
our last drop of blood,
if we have to become bleached bones
in this desert,
we must defend it to the death!
We must let the Rourans know,
as Wei soldiers we will never surrender
and we will never retreat!
Soldiers may rebel against me,
generals may leave me for dead,
but l, Hua Mulan,
will never betray my country!
Brothers!
After this meal,
we will kill their Danyu
and chop down their flag!
- Are you afraid to die?
- No!
- Are you afraid to die?
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
Black Wind,
in our next life, we'll reverse roles,
and you can kill me.
General, you can't kill Black Wind!
Kill me instead!
You must not kill Black Wind! General!
General!
General! General!
General!
General! You should rest.
Get your Danyu to come here and talk!
I am seventh son of the Wei Emperor!
Toba Hong!
Leave your best medics and supplies!
I will come with you!
Let my brothers go!
The life of a Prince in exchange
for several thousand soldiers?
Deal!
Leave the medics and supplies!
Let's go!
Yes, sir!
Danyu orders a retreat!
I didn't imagine
you would recover so quickly.
I still have many
important things to do.
General!
When our brothers have recovered,
lead them back home.
General, where are you going?
- You must not follow me.
- General!
- General!
- General!
This is a military command!
General!
- Take care, everyone.
- General!
General!
Danyu!
What are you doing?
- Pick it up!
- Yes, sir.
How much gold do you think
your father will pay for you?
He doesn't like me,
so you may be disappointed.
Even wolves protect their cubs,
never mind humans.
I’ve never, and don't
plan to, befriend a wolf.
You are right.
Ln your eyes l am a wolf.
But for us Rourans,
l am a once-in-a millennium heroic king.
He who wins his people's hearts
wins his nation.
You think you can take
the world with a knife?
You may be a victorious conqueror,
but if you cannot let
your people live a good life.
Even if you are lucky enough to win,
there will be thousands like me
who will fight against you.
Causing piles of white bones,
just to satisfy your personal ambition!
Are you talking like a drunk,
because you cannot hold your alcohol?
Thank you!
I know what you are thinking.
Don't worry.
When I take the Wei territory
and become king,
I will fulfill your dream
of becoming queen.
I wanted to be a queen of Wei,
so that future
generations of Rourans
won't have to suffer
the ravages of war.
It is different from your reason!
No matter how much land you take,
I know what you have done.
- Who are you?
- Don't worry, Princess.
I am Wei General Hua Mulan.
I know of you.
Are you trying to use me
to rescue your Prince?
I respect your dream
of making peace
between our countries.
I wish to help you fulfill your dream.
Fulfill my dream?
You overestimate me. L am just a woman.
My brother killed our
father for the throne,
and l dare not speak up!
Actually, l am also a woman.
Amazing!
I enlisted in my father's place,
just to fulfill my filial duty.
I never imagined l would achieve
any accomplishments, not to
mention that one
day, l would become
a butcher on the battlefield.
Ln these twelve years,
my heart has never felt at ease.
Princess, only when we resolve
the cause of this war,
can we stop the war itself.
Your own fate, as well as
that of the whole world,
is in your hands.
Your messengers have come,
and agreed to all of my terms.
Your father loves you very much.
Thank you for telling me this.
Let everyone know,
we'll celebrate for three days!
Thank you, Danyu!
I’ve thought it through. You are right.
Husband, please have a drink.
Great! Come!
You dare to kill me?
I must avenge the Old Danyu!
Mulan.
Rise!
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Hua Mulan is here!
The Commander-in-chief was a coward.
I have dealt with him.
I bow before Your Majesty.
It's General Hua!
Salute!
We respectfully bring General
back to your hometown!
Master.
- Where is Father?
- He waited here for you every day.
Father.
I am home!
I hereby name Hua Mulan the
Commander-in-chief of the Wei nation!
I do not wish to become an official.
I have been at war
for twelve years and
been unable to take
care of my father
who has been ill.
Please allow me to go home.
I am a woman. Please punish me.
Lt is our nation's great fortune
to have a woman like you.
- L have long since forgiven you.
- Thank you, Your Majesty
l have an announcement
for the whole nation.
The marriage between my son Hong
and the Rouran Princess!
Our two nations will now be friends.
The fighting will stop forever
and from now on, there will be peace!
Adjourned!
Thank you, Your Majesty!
Hong, your marriage to the Rouran
Princess is a national event!
Do you understand your responsibility?
I do, Sir.
It's so nice to have a daughter.
Always filial, understanding
and obedient.
And now, she's a pretty General!
Come in! Come in!
Let's go away together!
Doesn't matter where!
You once said,
if you could give your life
to end this war,
you would do it.
It's easy for me to give up my life,
but it's too difficult to give up
the woman l love.
Ln order that there'll
be no more Tigers,
that no more families
end up with just a bloody dog tag.
I understand.
Forget about me!
For twelve years,
every day l woke up in the battlefield,
my first thought was always of you.
Knowing you were there,
gave me the courage to open my eyes.
Forever after,
it will still be the same every day.
Someone once said,
travel too far from home
and you will lose your roots.
If you kill too many people
you will lose yourself.
If you die in battle
your life will sink into the ground
like rain and vanish without a trace.
If at that time, you fall
in love with someone
hope will blossom again from the earth,
and passionately embrace life!
Thank you, Wentai!
