<i>Another year, a brand new diary.</i>
<i>Once again I was summoned, kicking and screaming,</i>
<i>to my mother's turkey curry buffet,</i>
<i>where I've had some of the most
shaming experiences of my life.</i>
<i>Hello, darling.</i>
<i>- Lovely to see you.</i>
<i>It was, as usual, crammed full</i>
<i>with some of the most dangerous perverts in the UK,</i>
<i>disguised as close, personal friends of my parents.</i>
- Hello, Bridget.
- Hello, Una.
- Oh, no, thanks.
- Love the jumper.
- I prefer what's underneath it.
- Uncle Geoffrey!
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Dad. How's it going?
I wish I was dead.
<i>But this year, there was one crucial difference.</i>
- Nice jumper.
- My mother's taste never falters.
Never.

<i>Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones.</i>
<i>I've found my happy ending at last.</i>
<i>And nothing in the world can spoil it.</i>
<i>Well, almost nothing.</i>
<i>Bridget Jones, what the fuck are you doing?</i>
- I, I can't see anywhere soft to land.
- How about on your arse?
Bridget, unless you want to get sacked at 6,000 feet,
you will be on your way in exactly three seconds.
Three, two, one... cue Bridget.
<i>A dangerous bane to the countryside

<i>Well... let's see, shall we?</i>
Go. Jump.
For Christ's sakes, go!
<i>- She's out. Unit Two, you got her?
- We see her.</i>
<i>- Bridget, open the chute.</i>

Sorry.
<i>? La la la la la...</i>
<i>So, as you can see, the incredible truth is</i>

<i>Bridget Jones is a love pariah no more.</i>
Morning, Bridget. Late again.
Yes. Sorry.
I was in bed with my boyfriend.
He's a human rights lawyer, you know.
Yes, we know.
<i>I cannot believe how fantastic shagging was last night.</i>
<i>Maybe I'll ring him.</i>
<i>No, no...</i>
<i>Obviously it's important to tell one's

<i>I'm fine, thanks.

Fine, though, er...
I've just had a rather graphic shag flashback.
And you do have a genuinely gorgeous bottom.
Thank you.
I'm with the Mexican ambassador,

And you're on speakerphone.
Oh. Right, well...
I'm quite busy with important stuff too...
Bridget, we're waiting for that tape

<i>- I'll call when I've finished.
- Excellent.</i>

<i>No, it can't be.</i>
<i>I will fight this. I am a journalist of

Oh. I was just talking about you.

<i>- Oh. No, that's fine.

Be as late as you like.
Chuck him, while you're not pregnant

I only said he was working late.
In one hour, he'll be coming in his secretary's mouth
while he rings to say what he wants for starters.
<i>Friends spend years finding you a boyfriend,</i>
<i>then instantly tell you to dump him.</i>
Even if he isn't shagging her already,
he's thinking about it.

Is he taking you to the Law Council Dinner?
Oh. Well, I'm sure he's just forgotten.

He's given you the night off
to cheer up your single friends. Sweet.
Actually, he's got a big case on, trying
to get everyone in Mexico out of prison.
We're meeting for a very late romantic dinner.
Really? That's so odd,
'cause I saw him an hour ago going
into his house with Rebecca Gillies.
She's only 22.
She's got legs up to here.

Who is Rebecca Gillies? What's she doing

Where he never asks me.
And with legs up to here?
- My legs only come up to there.
- You have fine legs.
Climber's legs.
I say go over there and ask him, straight out,
are you or are you not sleeping with Rebecca Gillies?
- If he says...
- I won't dignify that with an answer...
Then you know he's shagging her.

Hello, Mark.

Good evening.
Everything under control, I see.
Um... Excellent graph.
- Lovely legs.
- Thank you.
I am so sorry.
I thought...
Oh, I don't know what I thought.
Now you're really angry with me.
- No, I'm not.
- It's OK, you can say if you are.
- It's not the end of the world.
- I'll get you a glass of wine.
The thing is I ran into Janey Osborne,
who said she'd just seen you
with this girl, with really long legs,
and Shazzer and Jude said
I should get over here straightaway.
Following the orders of the dating
war command, you executed a raid.
- You are angry.
- I'm not, just disappointed.
Disappointed?
Oh, God, that's worse than angry.
I'm just disappointed I can't take you home this instant.
Oh.
What about all those lawyers?
Oh, plenty of time to butter them up
at the Law Council Dinner next Friday.
Don't want to go, do you?
I'd love to.
<i>Oh, stupid Bridget, stupid friends.</i>
<i>Wonderful, loyal Mark Darcy...</i>
<i>...who loves me just the way I am.</i>
- What are you doing?
- Getting dressed.
Why are you dancing around in that tent?
Because I don't want you to see any of my wobbly bits.
That's pointless, because I have
a very high regard for your wobbly bits

Is that your most serious skirt, Jones?
Oh...

I thought you hated television.
I hate watching television.
Being on it is... Hello there.
...entirely different.
Daniel, thought the Madrid piece
was outstanding, really original.
Cheers, Jeremy. Appreciate that.
We had to work really hard on that one.
Tosser. Talking of which,
how is Mark Darcy?
- You still...?
- Yes, I am.
And I intend to be for a very long time.
Good. You know what a fan I am
of any woman married to Mark Darcy.
- That's not funny.
- Seriously, though, Jones,
speaking purely unselfishly, I worry about you.
You do know that it's a fact that
most lawyer's wives die of boredom?
And what about you?
Still shagging anything that moves?
As a matter of fact, no.
No shagging whatsoever.
I'm in shag therapy.
It turns out I have a problem. I go
to meetings, talk about my feelings.
Hug people who smell.
- I don't believe you.
- I'm trying...
...to be a better man, Bridge,
so that the next time a better woman comes along,
I won't make a pig's ear of it.
Daniel. Meeting?
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.
Very good hair, Jones.
By the way, um, you're not free
for dinner tonight, are you?
No, I'm not.
I'm going to the Law Council Dinner.

<i>All right, tiny make-up mistake,</i>
<i>but I always have wit and conversation to fall back on.</i>

- Hello.

- Horatio?
- Yes, Horatio.
Horatio was just saying
he's totally against charitable giving.
- What?
- Well, obviously you don't mean it.
Absolutely. Do you think it's helpful

- Maybe he's just hungry.
- Don't be so naive.

- End of story.
- Oh, no, it's not.

Yeah, very good.
Tested my resolve.
How did I do?
You seem to have made quite an impression.
I've put you next to Giles Benwick.

- No. He's terribly nice,

Now I want to see your hands

Here we go. What are something

Superior copyhold.
Yes.
What is the correct grace used in the Inner Temple
for the second mooting night of Michaelmas term?
<i>Amas bibendo... fructis.</i>
Jolly good.
What is an overreaching conveyance?
What is rack-rent?
When was breach of promise abolished?
<i>Define "damnum sentit dominus".</i>
<i>Translate "reddendo singula singulis" into Ancient Greek.</i>
I believe this is the answer.
<i>Hippodamoi credemnon louestai.</i>
Absolutely correct.
Now, for our final and deciding round,
the category is contemporary culture.
Who did the design for Princess Diana's wedding dress?
The Emmanuels.
- Correct.

<i>Lucky Star.</i>
- Sorry, I didn't quite hear.
- Are you sure?
<i>- Wasn't it Holiday?
- No, everyone thinks it is,</i>
but it's not.
My entire life has been leading up to this very moment.
Take that knife, slice off my head
and boil it if I'm wrong.
<i>The correct answer is Lucky Star.</i>
No.
<i>- The correct answer is...
- Is it Holiday?</i>
<i>- Holiday, indeed, yes.</i>

the Legal Eagles.
- Lovely to see you, Bridget.
- Oh, thanks, Rebecca.
Good night.
Why didn't you speak to me all night?
That's the point of those dinners.
But you talked to Rebecca.
And you talked to Horatio.
I'll never fit in with your friends.
Not if you go on calling everyone
"balding, upper-middle-class twits".
Well, they were balding,
upper-middle-class twits.
Except for the ones who had hair.
I suppose you agree with them
that poor people deserve to be poor?
Don't be ridiculous.
- So now I'm ridiculous?
- Yes, tonight you were a little.
Well, tonight you were an arrogant arse.
I think I may have made a mistake inviting you
and your folding underpants into my life.
Good night.
If you had asked me tonight,
I'd have said no, anyway.
Asked you what?
Bridget?
Asked you what?
<i>Oh, God, I've done it.</i>
<i>I've gone and done it.</i>
<i>One minute, you're closer to someone
than anyone in the whole world,</i>
<i>next minute, you're never going to see them again.</i>
<i>If you have a message for

Hello, it's me.
I'm really, really sorry...
Sorry, it's the door.
Don't go away, I have something

<i>- Yes, who is it?
- It's me.</i>
<i>- Mark.
- Oh, right.</i>
Er, just a moment.
I'm on the phone.
You're outside.
Look, er...
I'll ring you later.
Unless you've come to chuck me once and for all.
In which case,
bye and thank you,

Oh, God, please don't chuck me.
If you have chucked me, please change your mind,
I'll behave much better in future.
<i>On the other hand, if you haven't,</i>
please behave better
next time we go out. Stuck-up snob.
What do you want?
I'd like to come up.
You are, after all, my girlfriend.
Even though I shouted at you
and called you an arrogant arse?
Unfortunately, yes.
You see, the problematic thing is...
I love you.
W-what?
- I said I love you.
- I'm sorry, I missed that again.
I said I love you, for God's sake!
All right, no need to shout.
I'll come down and let you in.
You might be needing this in the future.
He said he loves me.
<i>- He said he loves you?
- He said he loves me.</i>
- Right, where is he now?
- He's in the bedroom.
Go back in there, Bridge,
and whatever you do, act completely nonchalant.
Bridget, you're staring at me again.
Sorry.
Listen, I know this evening didn't go exactly as planned,
but there was a very important question
I wanted to ask you tonight.
- Oh, really?
- Yes.
I've actually been meaning
to ask this for quite some time.
I've just never really found the right way to put it.

...would you...
...like to go on a skiing mini-break?
Yes!

<i>This is not just a mini-break.</i>
<i>This is a holiday in heaven.</i>

<i>I know I'm going to like skiing a lot.</i>
<i>Very romantic, very relaxing.</i>

Um...
Er...

Oh, God. Oh.
Ah.

Rebecca. What are you doing here?
- Didn't Mark tell you we were coming?
- No, he didn't.
It was me who recommended the place.
- I've been coming since I was 11.
- Really?
<i>Three whole years.</i>
Come on, up you get.
Come on.
- There you go.
- Are you all right?
Yes, fine, thanks.
- You sure?
- Why is Rebecca here?
Oh, God. Well, I mentioned
that we were coming
and she said why didn't they come too,
and I couldn't say no, could I?
Come on, you two, let's crack on, shall we?
Actually, I might just sit this one out.
You head on.
- See you down there.
- You sure?
Absolutely. I'll be fine in a minute.
Right, I'll see you at base camp, then.
<i>Bastard.

<i>Wait a minute...</i>
<i>No. Eight weeks?</i>
It couldn't be, could it?
<i>Totally undisturbed...</i>
<i>Oh, God. I'm pregnant.</i>
<i>And going to die!</i>
Oh, my God!

Big bump!
Get out of the way!
<i>Who's this? An eccentric

<i>from a total unknown,</i>

Oh, no! No, no, not pregnant.
She's bloated.
<i>- Condom?

There is nothing a pill can do to help her.
I'm a girl and I met a boy.
<i>Fraulein, and I met frau... boy.</i>
<i>And possibly now mit baby, uh-huh?</i>
<i>Right, moment of truth awaits.</i>
<i>What if I am pregnant?</i>
<i>I must try not to get hopes up too high.</i>
<i>Boyfriend and baby seems just too lucky.</i>
Bridget? I have been looking
everywhere for you.
I thought you'd broken a leg
or something... Oh, God.
- You're not...?
- I might be.
- What if I were?
- Well, I suppose I'd...
To be quite frank, it'd be bloody fantastic.
I mean, if a little ahead of schedule.
- Are you really pregnant?
- Well, give it three minutes.
- What do you fancy? Boy or a girl?
- I dunno, it doesn't matter.
Although, I suppose I've always had the fantasy of a son.
- Another Mark Darcy.
- Or maybe something like Huck.
Or River. Or some fabulous
Hebrew name like Noah.
Anyway, I could teach him to play cricket and rugby
and visit him at Eton on St Andrew's Day.
Eton?
Yes. The Darcy men have been going
to Eton for five generations.
Well, my son's not going to be sent away from home.
Especially to some fascist institution
where they stick a poker up your arse
that you're never allowed to remove again.
I see.
- I didn't mean you.
- No, of course not.
So what's the alternative?
Sleeping in his parents' bed,
breastfeeding until he's a teenager
<i>and some progressive school, where the
day is spent singing Yellow Submarine?</i>
Oh, you're absolutely right.
It's madness to allow a child to enjoy
his education or live with his parents.
What is madness is to have a child
if his parents can't have a discussion
without one shouting at the other.
It's negative.
- That's too bad.
- Yes, very sad.
Perhaps we should go out for lunch
tomorrow. Get out of the grump.
That's a good idea in theory,
but you made a family arrangement.
Oh, God.
Darlings!
I've had the fabulous idea of inviting your parents.
<i>Another one of Mother's culinary triumphs.</i>
<i>- Everything in miniature.
- Mini treacle tart, Admiral Darcy?</i>
No, no, thank you. The mini spotted dick
rather finished me off.
So, Mark, Bridget, when are you
two lovebirds going to name the day?
Bridget, you must want to hear
those ding-dong bells.
Well, we're certainly not thinking
about that yet. Are we, Bridget?
No. God, no.
Of course not.
Good.
Well, that's that sorted.
So, Admiral, out on the high seas.
How was it?
- Did you mean that thing you said?
- What thing?
- You know what thing.
- No, I don't know what thing.
The thing thing.
Now, let's see, there are any number of things, um...
in an afternoon full of all sorts of things,
so I, um...
The thing where you said you're not, um...
That you're not, not even thinking about, um...
What's the matter?
Let's get a drink.
I'm going to go to the loo, then I'm going to come back.
And then we're going to be civilized.
<i>If you have a message for Mark Darcy,
speak after the tone.</i>
<i>Mark, it's Rebecca. Are you there?</i>
<i>Obviously not.
Probably still out with Bridget.</i>
<i>Um... Anyway, I hope lunch
with the parents went well.</i>
<i>I'm sure you were dutiful and very polite, as usual.</i>
<i>Er... Whatever. Anyway, look, maybe
give me a ring when you get back.</i>
<i>I thought I might pop round for a nightcap.</i>
<i>But I suppose that's a silly idea.
Bridget's probably there.</i>

Oh, Christ, what now?
Are you or are you not having an affair
with Rebecca Gillies?
I won't dignify that question with an answer.
Right.
All I did was go to the loo.
Bridget!
Bridget.
That's not your coat.
Oh, right.
Oh, Bridget, what are you doing?
I read you should never date someone if
you can think of three reasons not to.
- Can you think of three?
- Yes.
- Which are?
- Well, first off, I embarrass you.
I can't ski, I can't ride, I can't speak Latin.
My legs only come up to here and yes,
I will always be a little bit fat.
And you, you fold your underpants before you go to bed.
- Now, hang on, that can't be a reason.
- No, it's not a reason.
But you're not perfect either.
You look down your nose at absolutely everyone,
and you're incapable of doing anything
spontaneous or potentially affectionate.
It feels like you're waiting
to find someone in the VIP room
who's, who's so fantastic...
just the way she is,
that you don't need to fix her.
Bridget, this is mad.
Perhaps you've already found her.
Do you want to marry me?
Look, I...
You see, you can never muster the strength...
to fight for me.

I have good news for you.
Sure, right.
What's the angle?
I interview some rocket scientist
while he looks through my skirt
with X-ray glasses?
No.
Although that is a bloody good idea.
<i>No. The fact is The Smooth Guide
is doing very well with women,</i>
but the network want us to cast
a wider net and use a Smooth Guide-ess.
Me? With Daniel Cleaver?
It's the next logical step.
I think Thailand is first on the list.
No. I won't do it.
Not now.
Not in a million years from now.
- Excuse me?
- I am a top television journalist,
not some boorish bint in a bikini.
Really? Strong words from somebody
who doesn't know where Germany is.
Who told you that?
Cleaver. He said he couldn't be expected
to go out with someone
who thought Iran was David Bowie's wife,
and who didn't know where Germany was.
Daniel Cleaver is a deceitful, sexist,
disgusting specimen of humanity,
that I wouldn't share a lift with, let alone a job.
Come on, Jones, there must have been
something you liked about me.
Well... you have a nice car.
And quite nice manners.
Outside the bedroom.
But that's about it.
And by the way, I know exactly where Germany is.
The question is do you know the location of your arsehole?
As a matter of fact, I do know the
exact location of my arsehole. And hers.
Oh, come on, Jones, it was just a silly joke.
Not a very funny one.
- Go on, then.
- What?
Where is it? Where is Germany?
- Next to France.
- And?
And also Belgium...
Poland. And it has a sea coast.
Which sea?
Oh, sod it. Now, look,
I think we should talk about Finch's suggestion.
I am going to Thailand, Jones.
Wouldn't you like to be my little Girl Guide?
Thailand?
- You'll shag before you leave Heathrow.
- I'll be perfectly fine.
I'm eschewing all men.
And cigarettes. And carbohydrates.
- We can't possibly let you go.
- On your own.
Oh, stop it, all of you.
I am a mature, sophisticated, professional woman
and I'm going to Thailand
entirely on my own, thank you very much.
- Fuck!
- Sorry.
- Fuckity fuck.
- Sorry.
<i>And now our final passengers
have joined us, we can get underway.</i>
Someone's gotta be last.
Are we not sitting together?
Oh, fuck.
I don't think we're really in a position to, um...

Sorry. Hi.
Sorry.

Er, Bridget.
<i>Good afternoon again, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>We're about to offer a wide range
of duty-free items.</i>
<i>Details can be found

Wonderful people, the Thais.
Particularly the young ladies.
If you know what I mean, eh?
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- Come with me.
Come with me now.
- Where are we going?
- Just through here.
Thank you. This is worse than school.
It really wasn't my fault.
It's a fizzy drink, you know, it just...
It just sort of fizzied over.
Couldn't bear to think of you back there
in slum class, Jones.
Graham, thank you. You are the best
air steward I've ever come across.
And if I may say so, the smartest.
Thank you, sir.
I thought you were there already, doing research.
Fuck, no. I make it up as I go along.
It's 13 hours for this trip.
I need some in-flight entertainment.
Why don't you tell me, in detail,
about your school netball tour,
particularly the unsavory incident
in the communal showers.
I didn't play netball.
Or go to a girls' school.
- Or have showers.
- Now that's just not true, is it?
- Let me start you off.
- No.

<i>Arrived Bangkok. Very hot.</i>
<i>Relieved at last to throw myself
into serious journalistic work.</i>
Thailand has long called travelers from around the globe
to take spiritual succour and karmic rest.
For centuries, Western visitors have been inevitably drawn
to some of Bangkok's oldest sanctuaries.
So true, Bridget. Even I,
fight it as I may, am no exception.
The moment I arrive here,
I almost feel an irresistible pull...
...to this. The Temple of Tranquility.
Indeed, nothing symbolizes Thailand's
extraordinary fusion of East and West,
of tradition and innovation, better than this.
Fully body-to-body massage.
<i>- Sawatdee kha?
- Sawatdee khrab?</i>
An incredible thing about Thailand
is the amazing traditional cuisine.
I'm going to taste kapaluk, the ultimate delicacy.
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!
Oh, my God. My God.
Um... Er... Mmm.
How about a lovely locust?
I can't. No, no, I can't.
They're delicious.
Oh!
Now that is Ko Panyi, which is
the setting for a very famous Thai poem,
which I think you'd like very much, Jones.
It's all about a badly-behaved prince
who finds true love with a beautiful,
and as it happens, very slightly overweight princess.
- You're teasing me.
- I never tease about poetry.
"Oh, Suvarnamali
Why can you not see that I adore you?"
"Why do you avoid and scorn me?"
"If you cast me off and leave me
How should I live another day?"
And you thought all I knew of Thailand
was pussies and ping-pong balls.
- You wouldn't sleep with him?
- No, of course not.
Absolutely not.
But he is clever.
- Yes?
- And handsome.
He's also a dysfunctional,
fucked-up, middle-aged, lost boy.
Well, no-one's perfect.
I didn't realize you were busy.
- He's young enough to be your grandson.
- I know. Isn't that great?
Come on, guys, I've got a very special
treat lined up for lunch.
<i>I'm getting rather fond of Jed,</i>
<i>and I must say he has a genuine interest in Thai cuisine.</i>
I wouldn't have thought omelette would be big in Thailand.
- Or mushrooms, for that matter.
- It's magic.
It is a magic mushroom omelette, isn't it?
Well, that's awful.
There is nothing funny in this at all.
Although, thank God,
the mushrooms don't actually seem to be working.

The best?
Aside from Simon Reade
in the fifth-form locker room, yeah.
Suppose I said you were pretty good too?
Pretty good?
Was I better than Mark Darcy?
By the way, is it true he always says
"I'm sorry, I think I'm going to come"?
- Who told you that?
- It's common knowledge, isn't it?
Come on, Jones. Who gave who the hoof?
And why?
Let's just say
that we suffered from a fatal incompatibility.
I have missed you, Jones.
I don't suppose there's any circumstances
in which you would ever consider
thinking about trusting me again?
Absolutely not.
Well, I suppose I'll be getting back to my little hut now.
Thank you very much, Daniel.
I had a nice time.
Is that the Big Dipper or the little one?
I can never tell them apart.
Definitely the big one.
You can't see the little one this close to the equator.
Oh, please.
You don't know about astronomy.
I most certainly do.
I'm passionate about it.
You know, Jones, if stargazing
is something that interests you,
then it has to be said that the view
from my balcony is quite outstanding.
Perhaps you'd like to come up and have a little look?
I don't think so.
See over there? Along my arm.
That's it, over there.
That is Orion's Belt.
And next to that is a very sexy little
constellation called Ursa's Maiden.
Ah.
She's being very naughty and trying to undo Orion's belt.
All right, what about...
that one?
Yes, well that is a very, very famous star.
Um, right next to, of course, um...
I don't know, some other fucking star
that's been there for years and years.
Seen one star, you've seen the lot,
that's what I say, Jones.

Yes, he sounds the most frightful shit.

But, you know, perky.
I can't believe you've come all this way.
I haven't. I was out here
handling a Foreign Office case
when I heard about your situation.
I haven't done anything wrong.
I promise you, it's all a big mistake.
Yes, well, I'm sure it is.
I've got all the papers here
and I'm sure we can sort it out.
I think about you all the time.
And I'm so sorry,
I really, really am,
for everything that happened between us.
Yes, well...
We don't have much time and I need you
to identify someone for me.
Is this the man with whom you were
seen taking hallucinogenic mushrooms
before you spent the night with Daniel Cleaver?
Yes, that's him, but I think you should know...
The same man who gave you the snake containing the drugs?
Yes, that's him, that's Jed.
But it was Shazzer's snake, not mine,
and as far as Daniel Cleaver goes...
Your sex life doesn't concern me at all.
Has there been any ill treatment here?
No, no. Well, I mean...
...the toilet facilities
are well below par, but...
Good, that makes things simpler.
Listen, they're prepared to drop all charges against you
which is extremely lenient, given the circumstances.
You're going to be out within a week.
And...
Goodbye.
Mark?
Thank you.
You're welcome. I'm just the messenger.
The order came from above.
Well, good luck.
Glad I could be of help.
So, Bijjit, what happen?
Well, um...
Bijjit! How this can happen?
This is terrible! You are innocent!
- They're always cheating us.
- No, no, no. That's all fine.
They've dropped the charges and they're letting me go.
But that good news.
What is wrong?
Mark Darcy definitely...
...doesn't love me anymore.
Ohhh.
You see the trouble is it was me who chucked him.
He treat you bad?
Yeah, actually, he did.
My boyfriend treat me bad too.
- Me too.
- Mine as well.
Me too.
Then you know all about it.
You think you've found the right man,
but then there's so much wrong with him
and he finds there's so much wrong
with you and it all just falls apart.
Don't tell me. My boyfriend,
he seem really nice.
Then he start to hit me.
Make me work on street.
My boyfriend, he say he love me.
But he do no work, and make me work 24 hour a day.
Then he make me take heroin drug.
What about you, Bijjit?
What your bad boyfriend do?
Well, er...
...he really didn't stick up for me
at this lawyers' supper...
and, um, then he would fold his...
Oh, same sort of thing, really.

he'd woken two Cabinet ministers and half of Ml5.
But none of them could locate Jed,
so Mark flew over to Interpol.
Which is in Lyon.
They located Jed in Dubai,
but they don't normally extradite people,
so Mark rang the Home Secretary who rang our ambassador...
In Riyadh. Then Mark flew to Dubai
where he identified Jed,
who was impounded and pushed out into...
Saudi Arabia, where Mark was waiting with the police.
Jed was arrested and extradited back
to Britain. Then Mark flew to Bangkok,
to make damn sure they'd let you go.
Oh.
He was just angry about Daniel Cleaver.
- He must still love me.
- He fucking must.
Taxi?
Yes, please.
Get in the cab!
Hurry!
Oh. I forgot about you.
Er, I, I, I just wanted to, um...
say something to Mark.
He's at the office.
Do you want to come in?
Oh, no. No, no, I don't think I will.
I really hope that you'll be happy together.
- Sorry?
- You and Mark.
I really hope that you'll be very happy together.
No, no, no, Bridget, listen...
you've got it completely wrong.
I'm not in love with him.
How could I be when I'm...
seriously heartbroken and smitten with someone else?
Someone else?
- You, Bridget.
- Me?
Ever since I saw you here with your hair messed that night
and bits of garden stuck to you.
You must have noticed.
I try to hide it, but every time I see you, I light up.
I thought you were just, you know...
...lying.
Was every look I ever gave you a lie?
I've been looking forward to this.
Lovely to see you, Bridget.
Thank you very much.
That was lovely.
Really lovely.
But I'm afraid it's still men in general,
and Mark Darcy in particular, that I love.
Right.
Lf, er, if I ever do decide to, um...
you know, bat for the other side...
...well, there's no-one else.
Only you.

What do you think of the whole jacket/trouser combination?
- Disaster.
- Actually, can we take a tiny detour?
I'll be back in literally two seconds.

I love you.
I always have and I always will.
Oh, um...
I don't love you, and I never have, and...
...I never will. Sorry.
Come in.
Hello, Bridget.
Hello, Mark.
Er...
I'm sorry, I'm disturbing you.
- Well, yes, a bit.
- I'll just...
sit outside while you finish.
No, no, no, please, say what you have to say, young lady.
Mr. Santiago
is the Peruvian Secretary for Trade.
And Mr. Herñez is his number two.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, hello, hello.
How can we help you, young lady?
Well, er...
Er...
I just wanted to tell Mr. Darcy here
that I heard what magnificent work
he actually did releasing me from prison.
Tiny, tiny misunderstanding to do
with an enormous stash of cocaine.
And I also wanted to say,
since having found out that his
girlfriend is actually a lesbian...
...that I love him.
Always have. Always will.
And that I'm...
...you know...
...available for dates...
...if he should feel so inclined.
So, er, your girlfriend is a lesbian.
Look, if you'll all just excuse us for a second...
I think we should...
Bridget, that was not the most romantic
proposition I've ever heard.
Well, maybe it is romantic
because it's not. I mean...
I know there's no music playing, and it's not snowing,
but that doesn't mean that it,
that it can't really be something.
You're right.
In fact, there's a question I've been meaning to ask you.
All right. As long as it's not
"Will you marry me?"
Oh, God.
It is "Will you marry me?"
Well, I'm not gonna say it now.
- Is it "Will you marry me?"
- The moment's gone.
No. No, no, no. No, wait.
Wait.
- Bridget.
- Start again.
- No.
- Start again.
I'm not gonna... It's...
We've just stepped out into the corridor,
you say "I've got a question to ask you"
and I don't say anything.
And... And...
You say...
Bridget Jones, will you marry me?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here this day
to unite this couple.
Do you affirm your love, one to the other?
I do. Again.
And Colin?
I do. Again.
As well. Of course.
