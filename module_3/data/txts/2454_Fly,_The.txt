Ah, Satan, mon cher.
You are late, yes, you are.
Still looking for your girlfriend, huh?
Mademoiselle Dandelo has found another.
You will never see her again.
But don't you worry. There will
be others.
Eh, madame?
Yes?
Yes, who is this?
This is François Delambre speaking.
Helene? How are you, Helene, dear?
What can I do for you?
François, I've killed Andre.
- I need your help.
- Now, look, Helene, it's past midnight.
I've had a hard day. I love you both
dearly, but this sort of a joke...
It's true.
I've killed Andre.
You killed... But...
Please help me.
Call the police and... Come quickly.
I just can't...
Helene.
Helene?
- Yes?
- Monsieur François? Gaston.
I tried to call you.
Something terrible has happened.
A man is dead.
His head is under the press.
And I saw a woman running...
Running away.
Yes, Gaston.
It looked...
I think it was Madame Delambre.
You stay there, Gaston.
I'll get the police immediately.
Anthenium Club?
Is Inspector Charas still there?
Yes, thank you.
Yes, I'll wait.
Check.
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
There's a call.
Thank you.
- Hello?
- Inspector?
This is François Delambre. You may
remember, we met a few times at the club.
It's just... I'm sorry
to call you so late,
but, well, I'm
in terrible trouble.
- Trouble, monsieur?
- My sister-in-law just phoned.
She'd killed her husband,
my brother... My brother, Andre.
What? At our factory,
Delambre Freres.
Our night watchman called too.
There is a body.
Where are you now,
Mr. Delambre?
I'll pick you up in a few minutes.
Good-bye. You'll have to excuse me.
- Inspector, Helene lives just...
- No, we ought to look here first.
- But I've got to talk to her.
- Please, I've already sent a man.
She'll be all right.
It's Andre.
- How can we raise the press?
- I'll do it for you.
Would you like us to get
one of your men?
I'll be all right.
Whenever you're ready, monsieur.
Dead about 30 minutes.
- Is the downstroke fast?
- No.
About the same.
- No danger of it coming down again?
- No.
It's been set for 50 tons.
- Impact zero.
- Zero?
Yes. That means
level with the bed.
- It's never been set that way. Never.
- Oh?
That would squeeze
the metal to nothing.
It's been set for
single strokes too.
She didn't know how
to operate the press.
- Are you sure this is your brother?
- Well, he...
There was a long scar
on his left leg. War wound.
- I'll... Would you mind?
- Doctor.
I can't believe it.
Can you think of any reason
why she would do such a thing?
None. Absolutely none.
They were completely
happy together.
They have a wonderful little boy,
Philippe, whom they both adore.
Helene was always so gentle.
It just doesn't make sense.
Andre loved two things,
his family and his work.
It's impossible.
- What is it, monsieur?
- The stroke count.
- That's the stroke count.
- I don't understand.
Whoever did this to Andre...
It reads two.
- They did it twice!
- Twice?
Oui, monsieur.
I heard the press come down two times.
- Good evening, monsieur.
- Good evening.
- Is it true?
- Doctor.
Yes.
- Did Helene...
- Listen, I can't believe it.
Inspector, this is our
family physician, Dr. Ejoute.
- Inspector Charas.
- Your man called me, so I came.
- How is she?
- Quite calm now.
Almost in a state of euphoria,
of relief, as though she's happy about it.
Is she insane, Doctor?
Helene Delambre could've
never killed her husband.
It's impossible.
Unless she is or was insane.
- Did she tell you anything?
- Nothing, except she killed him.
And how... No, there's nothing in her
that could make her do that.
Why, Inspector,
I've known her all her life.
I even delivered her.
She and Andre were
devoted to each other.
- Where is Madame Delambre?
- In the living room.
François, I'm sorry I called you.
As you see, I could've called
the police myself. I'm all right now.
Helene, my dear, you know
if there's anything I can do...
You're the police?
Inspector Charas, madame.
Helene, what's going on?
Why do you say you killed Andre? Why?
It's all right, François.
Everything's all right now.
Madame, would you
tell us what happened?
Of course, monsieur.
I killed my husband,
Andre Delambre,
about half an hour ago
in the hydraulic press shed.
You understand the gravity
of the crime.
You say you killed your husband.
That means you murdered him.
I killed Andre, yes.
- Why?
- I cannot answer that question.
- How did you kill him?
- With the hydraulic press.
- How do you operate it?
- First you put on the main switch.
Then you set the stroke
to whatever tonnage you want.
You set the stroke to maximum,
that is, level with the table, or zero.
Then you press the release button.
It's the red one.
You mean you put your husband
under the press?
No, Inspector.
He did that himself.
He put his head and his arm
under the press?
- Yes.
- Why?
I cannot answer that question.
Coffee, Inspector?
Yes, ple... Gentlemen, would you wait
for me outside, please?
Yes, of course.
No, thank you.
Now, madame, you were happy
with your husband?
There were no mistresses.
I had no lovers.
We were both very happy.
- That is the truth.
- Then why did you kill him?
I wish to help you all I can, Inspector,
but I cannot answer that question.
You pressed the button and it was all over.
Yes.
- Why did you press it twice?
- Oh, it was only once.
The stroke count read two.
A machine cannot lie.
Oh, yes. Yes, it was twice.
I... I was wrong.
- I did it twice.
- Why?
Perhaps you will wait, madame?
Of course, Inspector.
What would you advise,
medically, Doctor?
Rest. Maybe in a day or two,
her state of mind will improve.
Very well. You understand the lady
is under surveillance.
I'll arrange for one of our nurses
to take charge of her.
Of course. Thank you
very much, Inspector.
You can rely on me.
Well, what do you think?
Would you show me
your brother's laboratory?
Yes, of course.
This way.
This is the work
of a madman!
There was over $200,000 worth
of special equipment here.
Andre was always
so careful of everything.
Special equipment?
What was all this for?
I don't know. It could have been
anything, any one of a dozen ideas.
He... Well... When he'd develop something,
he would show it to me.
He was working on an idea
for the Air Ministry.
Perhaps they'd know.
I imagine electronics is
a profitable field these days.
Yes, very. We own
the business jointly.
We both have more money
than we know what to do with.
They had no outside interests.
None, I'm sure of it.
That's why it
doesn't make sense.
You're very attached to
both of them, aren't you?
Yes. Inspector,
what does all this mean?
I have no idea.
She would tell me nothing
except that she'd killed him.
There appears to be no motive,
no reason except insanity.
And even that leaves several
important questions unanswered.
Perhaps he
committed suicide.
Well, if he did, why does
she say she killed him?
And if it was suicide,
why such a clumsy method?
And why involve your wife?
And she was there.
She could hang for this.
Poor Philippe.
What will I tell him?
How does one tell a child?
If I may suggest, you could
look after the boy for a while.
What's gonna happen to her?
We'll keep her under
observation for the moment.
There's plenty of time.
Did your brother
ever experiment with animals?
Never.
- Or insects?
- Insects? No.
That would be funny if...
No, Helene and Andre believed
in the sacredness of life.
They wouldn't
harm anything,
not even a fly.
Lunch, madame.
Oh, I'm eating
much too much.
At this rate,
I'll gain pounds.
- Can I get up today?
- Ask Dr. Ejoute, madame.
Every time I ask him,
he says "Tomorrow."
You're coming along nicely.
The rest will do you good.
Is Inspector Charas
coming today?
He did not say, madame.
I like him.
He's been very gentle.
I hope François brings
that nice little boy today.
What is his name?
Philippe?
Yes, Philippe.
A nice boy.
They think I'm mad,
don't they?
They never tell me
what they think about.
Go away.
Go away!
- Is it bothering you?
- No. No, it doesn't bother me.
- I'll soon rid you of the pest.
- It's all right, Nurse Andersone.
Please leave it alone!
But, nurse!
Stop it, nurse.
Stop it!
Leave it alone!
Leave it alone!
- No! No!
- What is the matter?
- Let me look at that fly!
- You get back into bed!
- Please let me look at the fly!
- Back into bed.
Get out of my way!
Where is it? Where?
Oh. Oh, there.
Come on.
Come on, madame.
- It's just a common housefly.
- Yes.
Perhaps it's symbolic
of something deep in her subconscious,
as her psychiatrist believes.
Mr. Delambre,
do you think she's mad?
It's obvious, isn't it?
In spite of what
the doctors think,
I believe Mrs. Delambre's mind
is quite clear.
- Even when catching flies.
- How can you say that?
She must be mad.
What about Philippe?
She acts as if the boy
were mine and not hers.
She may be trying
to protect him.
- Perhaps she fears him or even hates him.
- That's impossible.
Helene couldn't hate anyone.
You must be out of your mind.
You're in love with her,
aren't you?
- Yes.
- Then why didn't you marry her?
Because she loved my brother.
I don't think
she ever noticed me.
I'm glad you're
being honest with me.
You see, at first
I suspected you.
Me? Why should I
do such a thing?
Motive one, for his wife. Motive two,
to gain control of Delambre Electronics.
What do I care about motives?
Helene is in trouble and Andre's dead.
It's... It's like a nightmare.
I know now you had nothing to do with it,
but I had to check for her sake.
I'm sorry, Inspector.
I'm a fool.
You've been so patient. Forgive me.
It's just...
I understand, monsieur.
It is I who should apologize. I have to
pry into all sorts of personal things.
It's necessary, unfortunately.
Thank you for coming.
If there's anything
I can do to help, I will.
Did you discover what
your brother was working on?
No. The Air Ministry scientists have been
through all of his papers. Everything.
They didn't mean
a thing to them.
We couldn't decipher the ashes.
Nothing there either.
Well, I've delayed all I can.
We've been quite patient with the lady.
I'm afraid I shall have to ask
for a warrant tomorrow.
- The courts can decide.
- Tomorrow?
The charge
can only be murder.
I'm sorry for
you and the boy,
but I cannot conceive of
any verdict except guilty,
or guilty but insane.
- Thank you, Yvette.
- Uncle?
- Yes, Philippe?
- When's Daddy coming home?
- Soon.
- Can I see Mommy again tomorrow?
- Yes.
- She's very sick, isn't she?
Yes, Philippe, she's very sick.
Do flies live a long time?
I don't know. Why?
Because I saw that fly
Mommy was looking for again.
I didn't know your mother
was looking for one.
Oh, yes, she was.
It's grown quite a lot,
but I recognized it, all right.
- Mmm, this is good.
- How did you recognize it?
Its head is white
instead of black,
and it has
a funny sort of leg.
It was on your desk
this morning.
Oh? I didn't notice it.
When did you first
see that fly?
The day Daddy went away.
I had caught it,
but Mommy made me let it go.
Then later she wanted me
to find it again.
She changed her mind.
You know how women are.
Excuse me, Philippe.
I won't be a moment.
Inspector Charas.
- Good evening, Nurse.
- Why, Mr. Delambre.
Inspector Charas told me
about her relapse. How is she now?
Resting quietly, poor lady.
But monsieur...
The inspector told me that I might speak
to her for a few moments alone.
- He knows I'm here.
- But he didn't say you were coming.
He has so much on his mind.
I won't be long.
Oh.
François, I didn't hear you.
You look tired.
Of course.
Just the office, you know.
You shouldn't work so hard.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. I feel all right.
I'm glad you came.
I wanted to ask you something.
Of course, Helene.
Anything at all.
How long do flies live?
Oh, I don't know.
I think a month,
two months.
The fly you were looking for
was in my study today.
- Did... Did you kill it?
- No.
You have it with you?
Give it to me.
- Please, give it to me!
- I haven't got it here.
Oh.
- You know now.
- What is this all about?
You haven't got it,
or you wouldn't ask.
Yes, I have it. It's locked in my desk.
Tell me what happened.
No, never.
Andre wouldn't want me to.
I know you're not mad.
I want the truth.
Either you tell me,
or I'm going to give it to Charas.
You swear you have it?
Yes.
If I tell you, will you
promise to destroy it?
- I can't do that until I know...
- Then I can't tell you anything.
For your own sake
you've got to tell me.
You're all right,
or you can
be all right perhaps.
As soon as they examine it they'll know,
and they'll know you're not insane.
No!
For Philippe's sake,
François, I beg you.
Don't you see? I was pretending
to be mad for Philippe's sake.
Better that I should
be declared insane,
than he should be the son
of a woman hanged for murder.
I want to know.
Either you tell me now,
or I give the fly to Charas.
If I tell you,
will you tell them?
I only want to help you.
I can only
do that through them.
Yes, I would tell them.
Poor François.
Call Charas then.
I can't tell it twice.
So long as you'll
kill the fly.
You promise?
Yes.
This is not a confession.
Although I killed my husband,
I am not a murderess.
I simply carried out
his last wish.
A few months ago...
Who's a ticklish boy?
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?
Andre! What
a pleasant surprise.
Hi, Daddy. Are you
gonna play with us?
Later, Philippe. I've got to borrow
your mother for a moment.
But I won't be long, I promise.
I'll tell you what.
Before you go to bed,
I'll play with you, all right?
- Promise?
- Promise.
- All right then. I'll play with Dandelo.
- Good.
Be gentle with her, Philippe.
Come on. I've got
to show you something.
But, Andre, we don't see you
for days on end.
- Then suddenly you expect...
- Don't argue with me. Come on.
But...
I'd no idea you'd made
so many changes.
- A completely new line of research.
- Let me guess.
- The permanent battery.
- Mmm-mmm.
Not the portable reactor?
I'll show you,
but there must be absolutely
no mention of this made to anyone.
- Of course.
- It's much too important.
Helene, you're the first
to see a miracle.
- Remember this?
- Oh, of course.
Our wedding present
from my devoted and very rich Aunt Bess.
Mmm-hmm. The family heirloom.
Hurry, put them on.
Now watch the box.
You can take your goggles
off now, darling.
It's gone.
Come on.
- It's the same one.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Have you turned magician?
- In a way.
For a split second, an infinitesimal
part of a second,
this was disintegrated.
For one little moment
it no longer existed,
only atoms traveling through space
at the speed of light.
Then here, a moment later, integrated
again into the shape of an ashtray.
Oh, you're joking.
Doesn't sound possible,
does it? But it is true.
It is impossible. You're
playing some joke on me.
Take television.
What happens?
A string of electrons,
sound and picture impulses,
are transmitted
through wires or the air.
The TV camera is
the disintegrator.
Your set unscrambles, or integrates,
the electrons back into pictures and sound.
- Yes, but this is different.
- Why?
Well, because it's impossible!
Fifty years ago, if my father
were told he could sit in Montreal,
and watch a World Series in New York
the exact time it was happening,
he'd say
it was impossible.
- This is the same principle exactly.
- But it's not the same.
- This is solid.
- Oh, no, it's not.
To your touch, maybe it is.
In reality, it's billions of atoms,
which we believe are only
a series of electrical impulses.
Uh...
You actually did this?
It's no trick?
No.
I can transport matter, anything,
at the speed of light perfectly.
Oh, of course this is
only a crude beginning.
But I've been lucky enough to stumble
on the most important discovery
since man sawed off
the end of a tree trunk
and found the wheel.
The disintegrator-integrator will
completely change life as we know it.
Think what it'll mean.
Food. Anything.
Even humans will go through
one of these devices.
No need for cars or railways or airplanes,
even spaceships. We'll set up matter
transmitting-receiving stations throughout
the world, and later, the universe.
There'll never
be a need of famine.
Surpluses can be sent instantaneously
at almost no cost anywhere.
Humanity need never
want or fear again.
I'm a very fortunate man.
I'm a very fortunate woman.
I hope you don't transmit me.
I wouldn't want to come out like this.
What do you mean?
Well, it doesn't matter,
does it, Andre?
Andre.
It's perfect.
Everything checks.
It's perfect.
Perfect.
Dandelo!
What's the matter? You hungry?
There we are.
That's it.
You won't feel a thing,
Dandelo.
And tomorrow you'll be
the most famous cat in all the world.
Dandelo!
Dandelo.
Hello?
Oh, François,
how nice to hear you.
Important?
You're getting married.
No.
No, not yet.
I think I like it this way.
It's just that there's no hurry.
Is Andre there?
Andre?
I've seen him about two hours
in the last two weeks.
He eats and sleeps in his lab.
He won't talk or answer the telephone.
- I don't want to hear one more word!
- I don't want to!
- You're going to eat your dinner now!
- I don't want to!
Philippe's acting like a juvenile delinquent.
Dandelo's disappeared.
I've even got to go to Professor
Augier's this evening alone.
You know how he is, Helene.
It's just until he solves his problem,
whatever it is. Be patient.
How you men stick together.
Anything I can do? All right, François.
I'll tell him if I see him.
I gotta run now, François.
Good-bye.
Well!
Where have you been?
Listen, darling, I'm sorry
about the last couple of weeks.
I had a little setback,
but it's all right now.
- Oh, I didn't mind.
- Hmm?
Well, maybe just a little.
Call Augier and cancel out.
We're going to celebrate by ourselves.
Wonderful.
I didn't want to go anyway.
François just called about some
special equipment. He's sending it now.
Good. By the time
you've changed, I'll be ready.
- Changed?
- I've got tickets for the ballet.
- The ballet!
- We'll eat at the Tour d'Eiffel first.
- Oh, wonderful!
- Now hurry.
We'll finish a delightful evening
with reintegrated champagne.
Finish?
- Well, not quite.
- Oh? What then?
What do you suggest?
You're in
an unscientific mood.
You don't approve?
I didn't say that.
Will the champagne
be as good as ever?
Exactly the same,
bubble for bubble.
Here.
- The label's perfect!
- Of course!
Oh, it's so cold!
And it'll stay that way until
I show you something else.
Oh?
No, Andre, don't!
It might not work. I won't allow it!
- It'll be all right.
- Andre, please!
Put your goggles on, darling.
It's astounding!
It works!
I test-ran it this morning. It's all right.
You've succeeded completely.
It's unbelievable.
We'll have to wait and see.
I'll know for sure in a few weeks.
- I don't understand.
- To see if it suffers from ill effects.
- Oh.
- If it's alive in, say, a month,
then we'll pronounce
the experiment successful.
May I look after him?
It's still a her, but you can.
For one whole month
she's mine.
Don't kill her
with overfeeding.
It's a little frightening, isn't it?
Yes.
The first live experiment
was disastrous... Dandelo.
Dandelo?
Andre, how could you?
She disintegrated perfectly but never
reappeared. I don't know why, even now.
I redesigned the projecting device,
and now it's perfect.
Where's she gone?
Into space,
in a stream of cat atoms.
It'd be funny if
life weren't so sacred.
Andre, promise me
one thing.
No more experiments
with animals.
I promise. No more
experiments with animals.
It's frightening.
It's like playing God.
God gives us intelligence
to uncover the wonders of nature.
Without the gift,
nothing is possible.
Oh, Andre, I get
so scared sometimes.
The suddenness
of our age,
electronics, rockets,
Earth satellites, supersonic flight,
and now this.
Oh, it's not so much who invents them,
it's the fact they exist.
But you're not frightened of TV
or radio or X-rays or electricity,
or that the Earth
is round.
No, but everything's
going so fast.
I'm... I'm just not ready
to take it all in.
It's... It's all so quick.
Just do like Philippe does.
Accept them as part
of our normal life.
They're facts, wonderful facts.
Which brings me back
to the champagne.
I love you so much, Andre.
It's wonderful
being married to you.
And to you, my love.
You're the healthiest guinea pig
in the whole world.
Andre!
- You'll catch cold.
- Not today.
- What are you doing?
- Oh, just looking at the sky.
- Looking at God, perhaps.
- You're a strange man, Andre.
So precise and practical,
and yet so...
- I don't quite know how to put it.
- So aware of the infinite?
The more I know,
the more sure I am I know so little.
The eternal paradox.
You said you were
frightened by progress.
I'm filled with
the wonder of it.
- Spring will soon be here.
- I like spring the best.
All life growing,
renewing itself.
- It's fantastic to be alive.
- How do you mean?
Oh, I don't know.
It's just...
I'm just so happy to be alive, that's all.
So am I.
Would you marry me again
if you had your time over?
I think so.
Well, I've got a lot to do.
- Oh, François is coming to lunch.
- Oh?
Bring him down to the lab.
We'll show him now.
Shall I call Professor Augier
and the Air Ministry scientists too?
Now, there's no hurry.
I... I don't even know how or why
parts of it work yet.
It's too important.
It's too impossible.
Poor François.
He'll never believe it.
Don't stay out too long, darling.
You look tired.
The last thing I am is tired.
And we're finishing
with crepes suzette.
What's all the celebration about?
I'm only coming for lunch.
- Andre wants to show you something.
- In the lab?
- Mmm-hmm.
- What is it? Flat screen?
It's better.
No more questions. Come on.
I've only been invited into
the laboratory three times.
Each time I came out
with a potential fortune.
Oh, dear. We won't
see him for lunch.
I see what you mean.
His writing gets worse and worse.
Mommy! Mommy!
Where are you?
Coming, Philippe.
Yes, darling?
- I got something to show you.
- I have something to show you.
I caught such a funny-looking fly.
You want to see it?
Let it go. You know your father
disapproves of you catching insects.
But this isn't like
any other fly I've ever seen.
It has a funny white head
and sort of white leg.
Now, you let it go at once.
Go along. Do as you're told. Go on.
Look at all that dirt
you brought in.
Best fly I ever caught.
- Was there anything else, madame?
- No, thank you. Good night.
Shall I leave something for the master?
Didn't touch a bite of his dinner.
Oh?
I fetched up his tray about an hour ago.
It was still outside the door.
Had his favorite pastry on it too.
Never mind. He probably didn't hear
you knock. I'll see if he wants anything.
Thank you.
Good night, madame.
Good night, Emma.
Andre? Andre, I'm going to bed now.
Is there anything you want?
Andre!
"Helene,
I've had some trouble."
Trouble?
Andre, what's the matter?
Answer me.
"I'm counting on you not to lose
your nerve, for only you can help me.
"I've had a serious accident.
"But I'm not in danger
at the moment,
"although it's a matter
of life or death."
Andre!
"It's no good calling to me
or saying anything.
"I can't answer.
I can't speak.
"You've got to do exactly
and very carefully what I tell you.
"Knock three times to show
you understand and agree,
"then fetch me a bowl of milk
laced with rum."
Bowl of milk? Andre!
- Anything I can do, madame?
- No. No, I can manage.
Go back to bed, Emma.
Good night, madame.
Ah!
"When you knock,
I'll open the door.
"Walk over to my desk
and put the milk on it.
"Then go into the other lab
and try to find a fly."
A fly?
"You will easily recognize it.
Its head is white."
Philippe.
Oh, Andre.
"Don't hurt it.
Just give it to me.
"Before you come in,
you must promise to obey me implicitly.
"Do not look at me.
Talking is useless. I cannot answer.
"Knock three times to show
I have your promise.
"My life is in your hands."
You can depend on me, darling.
It's not in here.
If you can't talk, knock.
Knock once for "yes" and twice for "no."
Do you understand?
We'll find the fly tomorrow.
I promise.
Just as soon as it's light,
I'll start looking.
Now, why don't you go to bed?
I'll help you.
No one will see you. I promise.
Philippe caught a fly
this morning.
He said its head was white.
I didn't see it.
I made him let it go.
"Come back in morning.
Will type explanation.
"Need you fresh and strong tomorrow.
Poor darling. Sorry."
I'm all right now, darling.
Don't worry.
I'll find that fly.
Do you need
anything tonight?
Darling, please try
and get some sleep.
Good night, darling.
Andre.
"Remember
the ashtray experiment?
"I've had a similar accident.
"I transmitted myself
successfully yesterday morning.
"But in the second experiment,
a fly which I did not notice
"was in the disintegrator with me.
"When we integrated again,
our atoms were mixed.
"Now my only hope
is to find the fly.
"I've got to go through the machine
once more and pray our atoms untangle.
"If you can't find it,
I'll have to destroy myself."
Can I come back in?
Don't worry, Andre. I'll find that fly.
It can't be far away.
But you mustn't talk about
destroying yourself. You mustn't.
I'll call Professor Augier and the other
scientists. They can help you. I...
Don't be angry, Andre.
I only thought that...
Promise me that you
won't do anything.
Let me see your face.
I won't be afraid.
All right.
All right, Andre.
All right.
- Flies, madame?
- Yes. Close the windows.
- Catch flies?
- I told you, Emma.
A fly escaped from the lab.
We've got to find it.
- It's got a white head.
- Mommy!
I don't know what's
gotten into this house.
Mommy!
- Look. I caught lots of them.
- Where is it?
- Are you sure you caught it?
- Oh, the white one.
No. I haven't caught it yet.
I told you to find that fly.
I'm sorry, Philippe, darling,
but you've got to find it.
The white one,
only the white one.
- Gotcha!
- You fool!
I said catch them!
Don't kill them!
I'm sorry, Emma.
Please, just catch them.
Madame, there's one in the hall.
Where? Where is it?
Oh, it's no good, Emma.
We'll never find it.
Philippe?
Make some supper, Emma,
would you?
I'm sorry.
It's... It's just that...
Come on, Philippe.
Go and get washed up for dinner.
There's a good boy.
All right, Mommy.
Oh, Philippe.
I see it.
Don't move.
Go and get some sugar, quick.
Give me the sugar.
And close those doors.
Now, stay back.
Got him!
- Good boy, Philippe. Careful now.
- Let me see.
Oh, no.
It's in back of the curtain!
Oh, don't harm it.
Don't hurt it.
Oh, God,
don't let it get out.
You try and keep it behind the curtain.
I'll get it from outside.
Oh, no. Oh, God...
Please, God, don't let it...
Don't cry, Mommy.
Please don't cry.
We'll catch it tomorrow.
Don't worry.
Please don't worry.
Andre.
We caught the fly today,
but it escaped out into the garden.
I'll look for it again tomorrow.
You eat. I'll read this here.
"If you had caught the fly,
you would not be reading this.
"I know you will never catch it now.
It's hopeless.
"There are things
man should never experiment with.
"Now I must destroy everything,
all evidence, even myself.
"No one must ever know what
I discovered. It's too dangerous.
"I've thought of a way.
It's not easy, but I need your help."
Andre!
You can still reason, Andre.
You've got no right to destroy yourself.
You mustn't think about it.
You've still got
your intelligence.
You're still a man
with a soul.
You've no right
to destroy yourself.
We'll find that fly tomorrow.
I know we will.
Think easy.
But you've got to give me more time.
Why?
Why won't you wait?
Then see Professor Augier and
the other scientists. They'll help you.
They'll do anything to help you.
I've another idea.
You remember the ashtray experiment?
Go through again.
It worked before.
Why?
Please try it.
You've got to try it.
Please, Andre,
for my sake.
Maybe it will work.
I beg you.
Oh, darling, I love you
and I want you so much.
Please, please let this
come out right.
Hurry, darling.
It will work.
It has worked, hasn't it?
You'll be all right now.
I know it's worked.
No! No! No!
A strange story, Mrs. Delambre.
It's almost impossible
to believe, isn't it?
- What happened to his notes?
- He destroyed them.
- And the writing on the blackboard?
- I rubbed it out.
I see.
Well, I must be going.
Thank you for telling me.
Inspector,
it wasn't wrong
to destroy the thing?
A fly-headed human? No.
It wasn't Andre.
I couldn't have hurt Andre.
But I'm glad,
I'm glad the thing is dead.
I'll see you out, Inspector.
- Inspector...
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Inspector...
- Do you believe the story?
Well, it explains all the facts,
the reason for the press,
the fly, everything.
True. But I asked you
if you believed it.
Oh, I'm only a policeman,
not a science fiction enthusiast.
But I do not believe what she said.
It... It can't happen.
But you don't...
Well, I... I mean, you didn't know Andre.
He was a genius
in some ways.
Possibly. But matter cannot be
transmitted. Oh, the story is impossible.
I'll be back at 10:00 with a warrant
for her arrest on the charge of murder.
Nurse Andersone
is under strict instructions
not to leave her for any reason.
But, Inspector,
it might be the truth.
It is the truth, to her.
I'm satisfied now.
She's quite insane. She won't hang.
- Well, I'm not satisfied.
- I wish I could help you, monsieur.
The lady's in need
of a doctor's care, permanently.
There's no telling whom she might
attack next. Perhaps the boy.
But there must be
something we can do to prove...
There is.
Show me the fly.
- Good morning, Monsieur François.
- Good morning, Emma.
- How's the mistress, sir?
- Oh, as well as can be expected.
- Such a lovely lady.
- Yes.
Emma, when you had that mad
search for a fly, did you see it?
- Oh, yes, I saw it.
- What did it look like?
Oh, just a fly.
I'd say it was a bluebottle.
You know, quite a large one.
- Did it... Did it look any different?
- Not to me it didn't.
She and Philippe were saying
its head was white.
- But it was just a fly.
- Thank you.
May I fix you some breakfast, sir?
Nice cup of tea? Some coffee?
No, thank you.
Help! Help me!
Help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Help me!
We can manage quite easily.
Thank you, Mr. Delambre.
Well, I... I thought
I ought to be here.
Do you wish
to check the warrant?
- As next of kin you have the right.
- No, I'm sure it must be all right.
- Madame? Time to get up now.
- Hmm?
Oh, I slept so well.
- Wonderfully. Is it a nice day?
- Yes.
- I think I'll have the silk one.
- Take this one.
- You must be warm.
- But I'm not going out.
Come in.
- Good morning, Mrs. Delambre.
- Inspector.
But I...
I don't understand.
I have a warrant
for your arrest for murder.
And I must caution you.
Anything you say
can be taken down
and used in evidence.
But, Inspector,
I told you everything.
It is for the court
to decide.
But you said it was not wrong
to kill a thing.
- You have to come with us, madame.
- François, didn't you show them?
You didn't destroy it?
Inspector, you saw it.
I'm afraid I did not,
Mrs. Delambre.
I lied to you, Helene.
I never had it. I never had it.
You never had it?
If you'll just come
with us, madame.
You never saw it?
Leave her alone.
She doesn't have to go with you.
I demand that I first
have time to talk to my attorney.
Dr. Ejoute will care for her.
I've already consulted with him.
The patient is ready to leave.
- I don't believe it.
- I have his diagnosis,
- and his authority.
- No, no, wait.
Don't make things more
difficult, monsieur.
- Here you go, ma'am. You'll be all right.
- No!
François, don't let them take me!
Don't let them lock me up!
François, please...
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Philippe.
Oh, François, do something.
Don't let him see me like this.
Please!
Philippe. You can't see her,
Philippe, not at the moment.
I'll take you for a walk.
I know. I'll take you to the movies.
But they don't open
till this afternoon.
Then I'll take you
this afternoon.
Is the ambulance for Mommy?
Yes.
Is she going
to be all right?
Yes. All right.
- I ran all the way over here.
- Oh?
I wanted to see
how she was.
- I wanted her to play with me.
- She'd like that, Philippe.
But she can't, not now.
- When's Daddy coming home then?
- Soon, Philippe.
- I saw that funny-looking fly again.
- Oh?
- Which show will we go to?
- Any...
You saw the fly? Where?
It's in a web.
A spider's going to get it.
By the bench
in the garden.
- You're sure?
- Oh, yes.
Stay here a minute.
- It's in the garden. Come quickly.
- Please, Monsieur Delambre...
Philippe has seen it. It's there.
I beg of you. Please, please.
All right.
Show me where.
Here, Uncle François.
Wait in the house.
There's a good boy,
Philippe.
Help me! Please help me!
Help! Help me!
Please help me!
Please!
Go away! Go away!
No! No! No!
Charas.
I didn't believe it,
but you saw it.
- You saw it, didn't you?
- Yes, I... I saw it.
- I thought she was...
- As God is my witness, I saw the thing.
It's unbelievable.
I shall never forget that scream
as long as I live.
You've committed murder,
just as much as Helene did.
You killed a fly
with a human head.
She killed a human
with a fly head.
If she murdered, so did you.
I know. But who's going to believe us?
They'll think we're both mad.
But he could have started the press
and got under it in time.
It could have been suicide.
Andre's mind was deranged.
Helene just tried to stop him.
But the stroke count?
I was the one who forgot to reset it
after it was used the last time.
Yes. Yes.
It could have been suicide.
Oh, a great shot, Philippe.
- Oh, François. Thank you.
- Hello. You look wonderful.
- Hi, Uncle François.
- Hi, Philippe.
You taking me to the zoo
like you promised?
- Yes, if your mother...
- Oh, you two run along.
We'll all have dinner together later.
Oh, good.
- Uncle.
- Yes?
Mommy told me
about Daddy.
Something
she said to ask you.
Why did he die?
Well, Philippe,
he died
because of his work.
He was like an...
Like an explorer in a wild country,
where no one
had even been before.
He was searching
for the truth.
He almost found
a great truth.
But for one instant,
he was careless.
- That's what killed him?
- Search for the truth
is the most important work in the whole
world and the most dangerous.
I'd like that.
I'd like to be an explorer like him.
- Will you help me, Uncle François?
- Yes, Philippe.
- You better run and get a coat.
- Yes. Right away.
You're a dear one, François.
So kind and thoughtful.
Thank you.
Here I am.
Well, come along, you two.
