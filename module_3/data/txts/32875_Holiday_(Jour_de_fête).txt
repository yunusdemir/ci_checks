G,L,DELKING
Robyn?
Will you marry me?
Yeah.
(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)
I want to make
love to you tonight.
MAN: Don't be scared, Murch!
I just thought we had
a connection back there.
JULIAN:
<i>We are doing what we must</i>
to build a school
where we can really
teach excellence.
And that's really
what I wanted to do.
Who was that pop-tart?
Shelby, it's over.
Oops.
(SCREAMING)
I am a pimp,
so my future
looks mighty bright,
thank you very much.
(LAUGHING)
HARPER: <i> A long, long,</i>
<i>long time ago,</i>
<i>Mia slept with your best man.</i>
LANCE: <i> I could've</i>
<i>killed you last night.</i>
I still could right now.
HARPER: <i> It wouldn't</i>
<i>change anything.</i>
You can hate
me forever, man.
But not Mia.
She loves you so much.
<i>Man, you're staring</i>
<i>your ideal woman in the face.</i>
<i>You two are made</i>
<i>for each other.</i>
Daddy's on! Daddy's on!
MAN: (ON TV)
<i>Let's go down to the field</i>
<i>and start with Pam Oliver.</i>
<i>Wow, Lance,</i>
<i>another 100-plus yards.</i>
<i>That all-time</i>
<i>record is in your sights.</i>
LANCE: <i> Yeah, it's nice,</i>
<i>but the win is better.</i>
<i>How much pressure</i>
<i>do you feel to perform</i>
<i>at a high level?</i>
<i>I love football,</i>
<i>but it's my job.</i>
<i>It's not life or death.</i>
<i>I just continue to do</i>
<i>my best with what God</i>
<i>gave me, that's all.</i>
PAM: <i> Congratulations.</i>
<i>Appreciate it.</i>
LANCE: <i> Thanks a lot.</i>
<i>All right, y'all?</i>
PAM: <i> And back to you</i>
<i>guys in the studio.</i>
(EKG BEEPING)
(FAINT HEARTBEAT)
(SIGHS)
Baby's still breech.
This one is determined
to come out feet
or buttocks first.
Everything looks
okay though, right, Doc?
Mmm-hmm. But we need to
schedule a C-section.
It's just safer.
There goes my
<i>Sports Illustrated</i>
swimsuit cover.
Airbrush.
You're due...
BOTH: New Year's Eve.
Right.
Great way to celebrate.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
And you're still working?
Yeah, she's on her
feet a lot, so...
Is there cause for concern?
Not really,
but given your history,
I'd err on the
side of caution.
You're not saying
bed rest, right?
Look, if that's
what it takes, then...
Nothing like that.
Just, if you can,
see if you can take
your maternity leave now.
It's nesting time.
Look, it's been
a long journey, you guys.
We are almost there.
(BURPS)
HARPER: Oh.
It's the baby.
Oh, hey. Um.
We got another
invitation from Mia.
Ah.
I guess she really
wants us there.
Maybe we should go.
Oh, so now you're
interested in going, huh?
It's not my first choice
for a holiday weekend,
but it might be fun.
Especially for you.
You've been so
preoccupied with your book.
Yeah.
It'd be good for you
to be with your friends.
Yeah.
Might be a cause
for celebration.
Well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves.
Never that.
Always the pessimist.
Well, that's why
I married an optimist.
(CHUCKLES)
STAN: I can't sell this.
What? Why not?
Well,
because nobody's buying it.
And I've tried everybody.
And I mean nothing.
All right, well,
can we self-publish?
Harper, I don't even think
your loyal fans want this.
If they even
know you're alive.
You don't even tweet,
for Christ's sakes.
Come on, Stan,
you know I hate that shit.
Harper, people have
the attention span
for 140 characters,
not 140 characters.
Look. You're only as
good as your last book.
And that was a mild hit
back when Obama
was first elected.
Senator Obama.
We need another one of these.
Months on the <i> New York Times</i>
bestseller list. Months! Look.
"It's groundbreaking.
Sexy, funny, smart."
And not just
"black people" smart.
You set a very
high bar here, Harper.
Look at that guy.
Vibrant, handsome, hair.
What happened to him?
NYU just laid me off.
Jesus Henry Christ.
When it rains, it pours.
Yeah.
I haven't told Robyn yet.
Why not?
Was there a scandal?
Was it a young, nubile...
Shit.
It's too bad. Sex sells.
Seen this?
<i>Don't Hate, Emulate.</i>
I tell you, these housewives,
they're like a gold mine.
(CAT YOWLING)
(SIGHS)
Harpy, I've been in
this business a long time.
That novel is not
the game changer
that you need.
What am I going to do?
You know what you need to do.
Oh. Stan, no.
Yes.
I will not.
Harper, it is the
time and now.
Lance Sullivan.
Your friend, Lance Sullivan.
One of the most popular,
scandal-free
athletes of all time.
He's heroic,
he's charismatic.
And he's retiring.
I know.
Ka-ching!
You get him to commit
to you being the author
of his bio,
you're gonna get
an advance like that!
A big advance.
Stan, things haven't
been the same between
Lance and me
since I first wrote
<i>Unfinished Business.</i>
And besides, I don't
even know if biography
is my thing.
Fuck your thing!
This is a check!
Exploit your friend
for capital gain!
This is America!
(BELL CHIMING)
MAN: Merry Christmas!
(ANSWERING MACHINE)
<i>Hi. This is Robyn.</i>
<i>Leave me a message!</i>
(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)
JORDAN: <i> Diversity?</i>
Diversity? Michael,
are you even
watching the network?
What do you think
I'm fighting for 24/7?
Listen, I don't care
who you call.
You can call Jesse,
you can call Barack,
you can call Jesus Christ.
But I'm gonna
tell you right now,
that it just doesn't work
for our programming.
Thank you, Michael.
(CHUCKLES)
Ugh!
Ooh!
Hate to be on the other side
of that phone call.
(CHUCKLES) Well,
you know your people.
So the hermit emerges.
To what do I
owe the pleasure?
Hey, what's happening, girl?
How are you?
Good to see you.
Gosh, you too.
You look great.
So do you.
Um...
I was just in
the neighborhood,
strategizing with my peeps.
Ah. The latest Harper
Stewart masterpiece.
(CHUCKLES)
So when's the debut?
In due time. In due time.
Well, you better
hurry up, because
your fans are waiting.
It's been like, what,
three years now?
No, it's been like two.
Really?
Yeah. Two and a half.
No, I think it's
more like three.
Anyway.
Anyway.
So, how's Robyn?
Oh. She's good.
That baby's
coming soon, huh?
Yeah.
I really wanted to get
you something, but...
A bunch of places.
Don't worry about it.
Where did you
get all these?
Oh, that's from
the documentary I did
on Reginald Foster.
Oh. The black billionaire.
Yeah.
He was a very
reluctant subject.
Really?
Yeah.
Then how did you get
him to agree to do it?
Oh, you know, Harper,
I never take no for an answer.
If the front door is closed,
I go around the back.
WOMAN: (ON INTERCOM)
<i>Jordan, I have Brian here.</i>
He's here?
Is that a work thing,
because I can...
No, you're fine.
BRIAN: Hey, J.
JORDAN: Hi.
Am I interrupting?
Uh. Not at all.
Lisa said you
were with a friend.
Yeah.
How are you?
Brian McDonald.
Harper Stewart.
All right.
Yeah. "Harp."
Sure. Harp, of course.
The writer.
Jordan's told
me all about you.
Oh. Ha! Oh!
Okay. Good to meet you.
You guys are
friends from work?
You guys work together?
(CLEARS THROAT)
No, Brian's my boyfriend.
(CHUCKLES)
Oh!
Yeah.
Oh! Oh! This Brian. Okay.
Because I thought
you meant the one...
No. Right, Brian.
Brian Mc... McDougal.
McDonald.
McDonald. Yeah, B-Mac.
B-Mac?
B-Mac?
Yes. That's what
she calls you.
Is that right?
JORDAN: No.
Harper!
HARPER:
Yeah, it's really cute.
So it's good to
finally meet you, Brian.
She will not stop.
She won't stop
talking about you.
Seriously, she won't stop.
I guess that's
nice to hear, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
(JORDAN CHUCKLING)
BRIAN: Listen, I'm sorry,
but I got to bail
on dinner tonight.
The boss is all up my ass.
No, no.
It's totally fine.
I get it.
You didn't have to walk
all the way here
to tell me that.
You could've called,
you could've emailed,
you could've sent a text.
Yeah, but the damnedest
thing, none of my
devices were working.
So I figured
I should just come
and deliver
the message in person.
(JORDAN CHUCKLING)
Oh, hey.
I changed my flight.
So I can come
with you to Mia's.
Oh. Great.
But what about Vermont?
If it's important to you,
it's important to me.
You guys want me
to wait outside?
Shut up, Harper.
Don't worry about it.
I got to get out of here.
I only stopped
by for a second.
All right, baby.
Mmm.
(JORDAN GIGGLES)
I'll talk
to you later.
Bye.
Nice to meet you.
Absolutely.
I guess I'll see
you this weekend?
Hope so.
Okay.
Brian McDonald.
"I like to ski in
Vermont with my devices."
I hate you so much.
Get out of my office.
"I like dating
chocolate girls."
JULIAN: The very last thing
has got me so excited.
With smart boards in
each of the classrooms,
our teachers compete
with anybody in the country.
Julian, you don't have
to sell me. Your school
is extraordinary.
Well, that's because
of donations,
from long-time contributors
like yourself, Elliot.
And that's what
makes this even
more difficult.
Oh. How do you mean?
Well,
your director
of admissions,
Candace Sparks.
Mmm-hmm.
She's your wife?
Yes, she kept her maiden name.
And how did you meet again?
(STAMMERS)
I'm sorry. What?
Yeah, no,
I'll be right back! Yep!
Hey, how are you?
It's nice to see you.
To see everybody.
1997?
'97, what the...
Oh, my God, look at...
Candace? No.
God, Candace.
Hi, Mr. Murch.
(YELLS)
Hey!
Hi. Say hi to your mom for me.
For me.
No, babe.
Oh, God!
Boy, pull your pants up!
No, no, no, don't!
Oh, my God!
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me!
Oh!
(ROBYN MOANING)
Oh. That feels so good.
Oh! Don't stop.
I think I'm gonna
keep you, Mr. Stewart.
You promise?
Oh. Honey.
I'm sorry things
didn't pan out
the way you wanted
with your book,
but the next
great idea will come.
I know it.
Stan thinks I should do
a biography on Lance.
Really?
Yeah.
That's interesting.
So you think I should?
MAN: <i> That is another</i>
<i>big-time carry</i>
<i>for Lance Sullivan.</i>
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)
(CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)
Oh, my God. Wow.
Looks like we're
the first to arrive.
Baby, come on now,
you look amazing.
I look like a cow.
You don't look like a cow.
Now, come on.
Sorry, I'm just
a little pregnant.
You look beautiful.
Look, I know you're nervous.
I'm not nervous. Just...
Let's not mention
my epic failure of
a book to anyone.
Honey, nobody here
is gonna judge you.
(SCOFFS) You don't
know my friends
very well, do you?
Come on, get in here!
Hey, now.
ROBYN: It's been too long.
MIA: You look beautiful.
Thank you so much, Mia.
Hey, stranger.
Merry Christmas.
How you doing?
Perfect.
Yeah? Good.
This is just perfect.
Come.
Children, come say hello.
HARPER: Hey, you all.
ROBYN: Hey.
LJ. Look how
big you all got.
Yes, it's good to see
you again, Mr. Harper.
Ms. Robyn.
Hi.
You don't have to be
that formal with us.
It's just Harper and Robyn.
Or Uncle Harp,
or Auntie Rob-Rob, or...
You don't have to
call us that though.
Yeah, no, don't.
That's weird.
Here, let me
take your bags.
Can I take your coats?
Oh. How nice.
Okay, this is off.
What a beautiful dress.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
So polite.
Do you have a baby in there?
Yes, I do.
It's still baking though.
And look over here,
you must be July.
No? Let me guess. Summer?
August.
August.
My bad. (LAUGHS)
Dap it up. There we go.
High-five. Pound it out.
He knows who you are.
Oh, look who's here.
August Wilson is
an American legend,
and a big inspiration
to this cat.
And I hope to one
day be on his level.
Oh, yeah?
You got a long way to go.
Your pops,
always clowning me.
Just like in college.
The old days.
Hey there, gorgeous.
Hey.
So good to see you.
There is nothing
more beautiful than
a woman with child.
Is it a boy or a girl?
Yeah, we're just
hoping for a healthy
baby. This time.
Harper.
We just wanted it
to be a surprise.
Oh. Well,
Harp's good for that.
(LAUGHING)
ROBYN:
Gingerbread house-making,
black and white dinner,
talent show,
ooh, spa day!
Story-telling, service day,
church, gift-exchange,
and box seats at
the record-breaking game!
Damn!
And both of their
families are coming, too.
Oh, word?
That's perfect.
Why is that perfect?
Oh, you know,
it's Christmas time,
family, friends,
lots of stories,
that kind of thing.
And a lot of work for Mia.
Oh, please,
are you kidding me?
She lives for
this kind of a thing.
Well, I don't think
Lance does.
He was giving
you a hard time.
Oh, no, he was just
messing with me.
If you say so.
Yeah.
Have you thought any more
about pursuing his bio?
His bio...
No, no, not really.
I think that's for the best.
You guys should
just concentrate
on being friends again.
Yeah, absolutely.
Let me ask you something.
Does Mia look thin to you?
Really?
You're asking
the pregnant fatty
if another woman
that you slept with
looks skinny?
Shh. Shh.
Don't shush me.
I'm not shushing you.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Oh.
More guests.
Please excuse me.
(GIGGLING)
Girls, slow down, please!
Baby.
Mmm.
We wish we had
as powerful a lobby
as they do.
Yeah, but they're
organized and we're not.
If they can get
the word "homo" banned,
we should be able
to get "nigga" banned.
Seriously.
Harp, my nigga!
What's up, man?
Merry Christmas!
Robyn! Oh, my God!
Girl, you look so good!
And your titties are huge!
ROBYN: Girl,
they won't stop growing.
Fellas, fellas, fellas.
Where you been hiding, slim?
I've been around,
you know, writing.
What's up with you
and brand management?
I don't know why
these white folks pay me,
to tell them what
black people are thinking.
Man, I'm light-skinned.
(LAUGHING)
I mean, I love him,
but we are definitely
outside the bubble.
But whatever,
I can live the lush
life for a few days,
get freaky with my man!
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
And don't worry,
I will definitely
drink enough for two.
Hello!
Make that enough
for three.
Oh, God, no.
Shelby.
Hi, Lancie!
Where's the kids?
They're running
around here somewhere.
Okay.
Kennedy, go play.
Go, go.
Let me take
your coat, Shel.
Thank you, of course.
CANDACE:
Do you see that coat?
I'm calling PETA.
That bitch just
killed 15 animals
this morning.
Julian. You're looking well.
Hmm.
Prada?
<i>Nada.</i>
Why has she got to be
up in Julian's face?
Harper,
(SIGHS)
I heard you had
writer's block. (CHUCKLES)
Hi.
Don't.
What? I won't bite,
this time.
Merry Christmas.
Come on, sands.
Let's go. Let's go.
Man, that bitch is crazy.
But she is fine as hell.
I so dodged a bullet.
Okay.
Right?
I mean, that could have...
A shot to the head.
Are you all
good on drinks?
Hey!
Big L, Big L,
hanging up
the cleats, huh?
What's next for you?
Broadcast booth,
coaching, business venture?
Damn, nigga,
are you writing a book?
That's a good idea.
No. Hey, come on,
you know... A book!
Non-fiction
is not my thing.
Besides, you could
get any biographer
you wanted, right?
Yeah, but that
doesn't interest me.
People only know what
I want them to know.
Well, that's what they do.
You can't blame them,
you're a star.
Well, everybody's
got a job to do.
As long as we
stick to football,
we're straight.
JORDAN: Hello, hello!
ALL: Hey!
Merry Christmas!
Thanks for coming.
Robyn, stop it.
I'm just saying,
Jordan's good people,
you should get to know her.
What's to know?
She's career-obsessed
and lives on her BlackBerry.
True, but she's not
some ideal from
a piece of fiction.
Julian.
Brian. Nice to meet you.
Good to see
you again, Harper.
Now, her man,
on the other hand,
is iconic.
Mmm. If I went that way,
that's what I'd get.
A tall, vanilla
swagger latte.
(INHALES)
I like, I like, I like.
What did...
Hi, baby!
Busted!
What's wrong with you, man?
Not now, Quentin.
Not now.
No, dude, you've
been tripping all night.
Don't...
Come here. Come here!
JORDAN: Hey, Candace!
You look gorgeous.
Thank you, girl.
Thank you so much.
Hi.
Hi, Robyn.
How are you?
Hi, Jordan.
How's it going in there?
It's going good,
no complaints.
That is going
to be a big baby.
(LAUGHING)
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)
I mean, beautiful baby.
MIA: Everyone?
I can't tell you
how good it is to have
all of us under
the same roof again.
And Brian, welcome.
Thank you for having me.
I wish it could be
for the whole weekend.
Oh. Where are
you guys headed?
Oh. It's just him.
Oh.
My family's got
a place up in Vermont,
so we always
get together
this time of year.
Ski, hang out by
the fireplace,
stuff like that.
Yeah, the snow and I
just don't really
get along, do we?
Could have fooled me.
Ah!
And Brian and I
are going to Hawaii
the day after Christmas.
Oh, you have to stay
at the Four Seasons
in Maui. Honeymoon suite.
And which honeymoon was that?
My next one.
CANDACE: So, Lance,
y'all making the playoffs
this year or what?
Yeah, that Atlanta
D is pretty tough.
It is tough,
but we will definitely
make the playoffs.
CANDACE: Okay, all right.
And what about
that rushing record?
Really? We're gonna talk
about football all night?
Oh. I am so sorry, Shelby.
Please, fill us all
in on the scintillating
world of mudslinging
housewives.
Candace.
SHELBY: "Scintillating."
Mmm. Such a big word.
Just like the TV show.
Mmm-hmm.
One hundred seventy-six.
Yards for the record.
Right, Lance?
Right, yeah, 176.
Right.
You remember your
first pro yards?
Why don't you hop
on that broom and fly
back out the window?
Quentin!
So, Murch,
how's the fundraising going?
Oh, uh...
We ran into a snag
this week. (CLEARS THROAT)
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Is it Elliot?
Yeah, he's not
contributing this year.
Elliot Gibson,
the philanthropist?
Isn't he a bit
of a morality nut?
Yeah! Yeah, that's him.
My God.
Did he say why?
To hell with him, man!
We got you.
What's his usual
contribution?
Two million.
Oh, hell no.
Murch, if you need anything,
just let me know.
No, no, no!
You sure about that?
You guys have done
more than enough.
Thanks. I can handle this.
MIA: Listen, I have
a fabulous weekend planned.
And after dessert,
it's pajama time!
You know I like
to sleep naked.
ROBYN: Oh, God.
JORDAN: Quentin.
So, about those yards, Lance.
You remember your first...
I'm sorry, can I trouble you
for the bathroom?
Of course.
Lance, could you?
Yeah.
Mmm mmm mmm.
Look at her.
That waddle brings
back nightmares.
All of you men
need to do your wives
a favor and get snipped.
Jesus.
You too, Robin Thicke.
Yeah, I said it.
Mia,
do you have some Prosecco?
Where are those people?
Hello? Excuse me?
(TAPPING GLASS)
QUENTIN: How did this
Elliot guy find this
in the first place?
How do I know?
Is he a porn watcher?
First of all,
it's not porn.
Well, I'm getting
a little excited.
Cut it out.
Get your hands off.
And 165,328,
29, 30 viewers
say otherwise.
(SIGHS)
You're not
making this better.
This is getting me
a little excited.
Stop it!
CANDACE: So,
the girls are down.
Oh!
Don't you guys
look cute in your PJs!
Yeah.
Yeah, nice.
Hey, um...
We're going, right, Murch?
Oh. We were gonna go
hang out with the fellas.
You don't mind, do you?
Oh. No!
Please, they got 900
channels up in here.
Plus, me and Robyn are
gonna sit up and talk
about people, so... (CHUCKLES)
Perfect.
Talking about people.
Oh, um, babe,
can I use your phone?
Because I can't get
a signal up in here.
My cell?
(STAMMERS)
The one I'm holding?
In my hand?
Yeah, stop!
Would you hand me that?
(PANTING)
Are you sure that
he just smokes weed?
Are you happy?
Yes, very.
And thankful.
Whatever you want, baby.
I want you to be
a little nicer.
I thought I was being nice.
To everybody.
All right.
(INDISTINCT WHISPERING)
You're doing a bio
on Lance, aren't you?
What?
Oh. Harper,
please don't play dumb.
It belittles both of us.
So this is what you've
been strategizing about!
Uh. Yeah, yeah.
What do you think?
I think it's brilliant.
Have you asked him?
No, I've got to
figure out an approach.
You already got him
with that first
yards question.
Just brush off those
journalistic skills
and get in there.
You've got to convince
him that he needs
to tell his story.
Well, that's a lot
easier said than done.
Well, just keep
talking to him.
And you know what?
If you need me to,
I can work on Mia,
because you know
he'll do whatever she says.
All right, cool.
So, where's
the thrilla in vanilla?
So, slim.
Is Jordan your first safari
into the enchanted jungle?
How do we know that
this ain't some Django
Candyland fantasy?
(CHUCKLES)
Come on, man. I've dated
all kinds of women.
But Jordan is pretty special.
I'm surprised she got
past all of you guys.
Who says she did?
He's just
messing with you, man.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Okay.
Ain't nobody here
been with her, man.
Not that there
wasn't an attempt, though.
What?
Oh, really?
Why would you say
something like that?
I didn't even
look at you!
Shut up, Murch.
I'm watching TV.
Look, man, honestly,
we're brother and sister.
For real.
Come on, man, no worries.
It's all good.
I'd have to be
a bitch to be concerned
about her past
like that, right?
I like him.
Do you think
Brian is going to pop
the question when
you guys get to Hawaii?
No, I don't think
we're there yet.
Armstrong, you are
such a commitment-phobe.
No, I'm not a
commitment-phobe.
I just don't do it
as often as you do.
Oh, touché, bitch!
Jordan, this is the
longest relationship
you've ever had.
Why are you
being so defensive?
I am not being defensive!
So, what is it?
I just don't know
that I'm ready to...
Give up the big, black dick?
(LAUGHING)
Can I get an amen
on the big, black dick?
Big, black dick.
It's big, it's black.
It just goes
in your mouth,
in your ass.
You want to talk to
it like it's a mic.
"Check, check."
(CHUCKLES)
Oh, don't hate.
Emulate, bitches.
You've got to talk to it.
LANCE: Oh.
Hey, man, do you guys
want me to step out?
No. See that, Murch?
You can't even
tell what happened.
Or, if something
did happen,
you can't tell.
Oh, so I should be okay
knowing that my wife
might have been
the headmaster?
Well, you did
marry a stripper.
Yeah, but that
didn't matter to me.
QUENTIN: If it didn't
matter to you then,
why in the hell is it
mattering to you now?
Could you just
put your phone away,
please? Thank you.
Well, now I have two
million dollars to raise.
And I have two little girls!
What if Keisha and Kelly
decide they want to
dance for money?
You did marry
a stripper.
Would you stop
saying that, please?
You married a stripper.
QUENTIN: You know what?
We can solve it
with one question.
JULIAN: What's that?
Which one of them,
either Shelby
or Candace is better
at rocking the mic?
Yeah, I don't remember.
What?
What?
Murch, come on, man.
Every man remembers
his personal best headmaster.
Yeah, and he should know.
He's been with white chicks.
They can do it.
Murch?
Shelby.
Word? Was it even close?
No, not really, no.
(GASPS) Murch.
I know.
Hell no, it ain't close.
Amen.
Really?
QUENTIN:
Look, I'm just saying.
If Candace
ain't the best at
rocking the mic...
I didn't say that.
I didn't say
she's not the best.
She can rock the mic.
She's rocking the mic.
She-mutt rocks it, right?
Yes, she does...
I'm done.
I'm saying,
if she's not the best
at rocking the mic,
then maybe she didn't.
Good point.
JORDAN: <i> So, Mia.</i>
What do you think
Lance is gonna do with
all of his new free time?
Oh, you better get him
some golf lessons or
he will drive you crazy.
Look, he can drive
me crazy all he wants.
Plus, the children
would love to
have him around.
It's gonna be nice.
Has he ever thought about
writing his memoirs?
He'd never get that bored.
Yeah, you're probably right,
but you know what?
He's got such a legacy,
and I think people
would love to
hear his story.
Your story!
I don't know,
it just seems like,
with him retiring,
it would be the perfect
time to reflect.
Mmm.
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe it is.
JULIAN: (CHUCKLES)
Nice move, nice.
Didn't Shelby and
Mia pledge together?
Yes, line sisters.
Line sisters.
Mmm-hmm.
That's why her
ass is up here.
Exactly.
Mia and Lance,
they take their
Greek life seriously.
What is that,
"Friendship is
essential to the soul"?
Along with manhood,
scholarship, perseverance
and uplifting.
In case y'all didn't know.
HARPER: Okay.
You think your
kids are gonna pledge?
Ain't no think.
Sullivan has been
frat over 100 years,
and we're gonna
keep that moving.
JULIAN: Oh! Nice.
So, tradition,
that's one of your
main principles, then?
I didn't say
nothing about that.
All right, everybody, then.
If you had to boil
your principles down
into three words,
what would they be?
For me,
it would be creativity,
stability and partnership.
Tradition, family and love.
JULIAN: Ancestry,
perseverance,
children.
Money, bitches,
pussy and getting head.
Mother...
That's four, first off.
Money, bitches,
pussy/getting head.
(CHUCKLES)
Mmm mmm mmm.
God, family, football.
In that order?
In that order.
(EXHALES)
L-Boogie!
I thought I'd hit
the trail myself.
Show me the way?
Well, the kids
look beautiful.
Getting big.
You must be proud.
Yeah, no doubt, man.
It's the best thing
I could've ever done.
Are you excited?
Me? Yeah, I'm excited.
Nervous.
Yeah, Robyn and I
were having trouble
Yeah, I did hear
something about that.
Was it low sperm count?
What? No, no.
No, I'm good.
It's nothing to
be ashamed of.
I'm not ashamed.
It's just a little
bit more of a challenge
than we anticipated.
(PANTING)
Are you all right?
I think I got
a pebble in my shoe
or something.
You're not the
author of this, man.
What do you mean?
You know, Faith was
a breech baby.
For real?
Yeah, no doubt.
29 hours of labor,
and my little baby girl
wasn't even breathing when
she came into this world.
Longest 15 seconds of my life.
But our faith.
Our faith never wavered.
Yeah, God's always
got a plan, man.
Just got to trust
everything's going
to work out.
I got a team meeting.
Let's do this.
I'll give you a head start.
(MOANING)
You were amazing
this morning.
I thought we were gonna
wake up the whole house.
(CHUCKLES)
You know how much
I love you?
Yes, I know how
much you love me.
No, seriously,
do you know how much?
I know that
you're gonna be late.
Wow. Always
on a schedule.
That's me. I can't help it.
And I love who you are.
Believe me, your
whole strong, independent,
Olivia Pope
thing is very sexy.
But sometimes you act
like you don't need me.
I don't.
Everybody needs
somebody, Jordan.
I'll call you when I land.
Yeah.
Or maybe I
should just text you.
Is that better?
No. Call me.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Harper, I'm gonna need you
to go to the store later.
Okay, sure. What's going on?
The caterer broke his arm
slipping on some ice.
Huh.
Too late to find
a replacement, so...
Well, isn't that
a lot of work?
I'm fine, Harper.
Okay. I'll go
get dressed.
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.
So, what's Harper
been working on?
Anything new?
Quentin, you're
sure you got the
Thai basil, right?
Yes, man! You told me
for like the 20th time.
I'm just saying.
God!
Robyn's real specific.
Plus, you can't tell
a pregnant lady shit.
You got a point there.
Yeah, man.
Y'all getting your balls back
for Christmas or what?
Married folk.
Anyway, shoot.
She's supposed to be
on maternity leave.
Here she goes cooking
a four-course meal.
Good for her, man.
She's got
Jordan here, man.
Not in the kitchen.
That's her arena.
Yeah, it is.
There's hell
of a tension.
Man, they should drop
the gloves and start
smacking each other.
I hope they show
a titty or something.
No question.
I'm just playin', man.
Between your wife and
your ex, it's like what,
<i>Mob Wives</i> up in here.
You need to have
a pay-per-view event.
Not a bad idea.
Maybe that's the way
you can close that
two-million gap you got.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I got it.
Hold up.
I got to take this.
Hold that, hold that.
Hi. Hi.
Hello?
Cute little
fuchsia phone you got.
Two million.
That's a big nut.
Yeah, man.
He's going
through it, huh?
Everybody's going
through it.
Well, how are
you doing, shorty?
What do you mean?
You cool?
Yeah.
Money-wise?
Because of the credit card.
I got to call the company,
because it's getting
embarrassing, but I'm...
No, this is
embarrassing, man.
I'm your man.
Look, you got
a baby coming,
and if you need something,
you talk to your friends.
Yeah, I'm good.
Good looking-out.
I appreciate it though.
You're a sensitive brother.
For real. I'm straight.
Hurry up, Murch.
SHELBY: What are you doing?
What am I paying you for?
I'm "TV's Most Notorious."
The endorsements
should be rolling in.
Notorious Martinis.
Notorious Heels.
Notorious Bubble Bath.
Why am I thinking of this?
Hold on.
Kennedy, please stop eating!
What is wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?
What do you know about this?
I know a lot more
than you do.
You have a child?
I don't need to have a child
in order to know how
to deal with a child.
I know how to
deal with a child.
No, you don't!
You're over here dealing
with everything else!
I'm on the phone!
Why don't you get
out of my business?
Ms. Notorious!
Ms. Notorious Brat!
Ms. Notorious everything!
Hey, hey, hey!
Neutral corners.
I'm sorry, Mia.
You want to help?
Help Kennedy.
I ain't nobody's babysitter.
Better call your baby daddy.
I hate your momma.
Ugh! Honestly. I hate him.
Wait a minute.
This isn't my...
Oh.
I was hoping that
we could schedule
a face-to-face meeting.
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Yes.
I'm sorry, could you...
Just give me one second.
I'm really sorry, sir.
Kind of busy
right now, Shelby.
Are you sure this
isn't a good time?
(CHUCKLES)
Good times.
Get your ass in here!
Hey! Hi, girls.
Hey!
Wow! This looks amazing.
And it smells so good.
Doesn't it?
Thanks.
So, what are you making?
Salad.
Salad, right. So pretty.
Hey, listen,
you know, Robyn.
but I want you to know
that I am really happy
for you and Harper.
Why are you telling me this?
Well, sometimes
it can be a little
awkward between us.
Like now.
Harper's my boy.
You're having his baby,
and his book is brilliant.
You read his book?
Oh, shit.
HARPER: Be careful, Q,
don't hurt yourself.
QUENTIN: Y'all trying
to tire me out!
Mommy likes
having you guys here.
Your mother, she brings
out the best in all of us.
Your daddy, that's
a different story.
Mommy says the same
thing about all of you.
And I know it's true.
Oh, really?
How do you
know it's true?
She's so much better now.
Oh, shit! Shit,
shit, shit! Fuck!
But just keep it
between us.
Please, Shelby.
I am begging you.
Okay.
Don't worry.
I can keep a secret.
I'm here as your
friend, Julian.
Okay. Thank you.
Oh, Quentin.
I believe that's mine.
And you need
privacy settings.
Those skanks
you're texting.
It's nasty.
What the hell is
she talking about?
All I mess with is dimes.
Well, not that one.
That's Butterface.
Hell, she's...
Mmm.
Really?
anything out of
the ordinary with Mia?
ROBYN: Mia? Mmm-mmm.
I mean, she is just
the sweetest thing.
You know she offered
for us to raid her garage.
Said there's a bunch
of baby stuff in there.
So you want to take
their hand-me-downs now?
She's just being nice.
We should at
least look at it.
You know it's
some quality stuff.
Robyn, no. We ain't
nobody's charity case.
Relax.
No.
It's Christmas.
Stop being a Grinch.
(PEOPLE CLAMORING)
So you texted
your penis?
SHELBY: I mean, it's not
packaged in any briefs
or anything like that?
Just raw penis?
I call it a stimulus package.
Oh, boy.
(ALL LAUGHING)
if we wanted to see booty,
we had to either cop
<i>Playboy</i> magazines
or get late-night cable?
And now porn is just
on your smartphone.
(COUGHING)
Are you okay?
I'm good.
ROBYN: You sure?
Yes.
I don't know.
It's kind of freaky,
but it's playful and fun.
Here we go.
Between you and
your mate, it's fine.
I'd do it.
And pregnancy sex
is the bomb.
Okay, Joe, I'm eating.
(ALL LAUGHING)
What about you, Candy?
Oh, no. You're not
catching my coochie
on YouTube.
My momma would be mortified.
She would be.
Right?
Yes, she would.
Really?
You know what?
She's doing it again.
I am about five minutes
off her motherfucking ass.
MIA: God is good, you all.
You know, you all
being here is a gift.
It's the best Christmas
gift I've ever had.
HARPER: That's so sweet.
I love all of you.
And Harper?
Forget your agent.
I'm pretty sure your
new book is going to be
absolutely wonderful.
What? Whoa!
What new book?
No, it's nothing.
SHELBY: Yeah, Harper,
what new book?
What's this one about?
Did Jordan steal
this one too?
Well, I never did,
but Mia is exactly right.
It's going to be brilliant.
And Lance...
HARPER: Jordan.
No, no, no.
Lance is not gonna...
You're not gonna
like this one, either.
This one's different and...
(CLEARS THROAT)
Okay.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Everybody,
I'll just put it out there.
My last book was
not the bestseller
that I thought it would be.
So there, I just put
it out on the table.
Well, you know what they say.
Every setback is
a setup for a comeback.
Oh. Who said that? Dr. Seuss?
No, your momma said
it when she had you.
That's who said it.
Oh, my momma?
We're taking it to
the streets. Wow.
So, Robyn,
how about that dessert?
Dessert!
Dessert.
MIA: No.
No. No dessert yet.
Not until we do
our talent show.
Oh, no. If we have to sit
through those children...
I'm gonna need something
stronger than this.
No, it's not the kids.
It's air band.
Air band?
(GIRLS CHEERING)
SHELBY: Oh, my God!
(R&B MUSIC PLAYING)
Okay.
All righty, now.
All right.
(WHOOPING)
Oh, my God!
JORDAN: All right.
(LIP-SYNCHING) <i> On a</i>
<i>perfect day</i>
<i>I know that I</i>
<i>can count on you...</i>
All right, Lancie.
Go, Lance!

<i>'Cause I need somebody</i>

(CAMERA CLICKS)
Oh, yeah. That's it.
Long shot.
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
(SIGHS)
(SHRIEKS)
(LAUGHS)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Okay.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
But you made me like this.
HARPER: <i> I just don't</i>
<i>understand why you would</i>
<i>do something like that.</i>
Mia asked,
and I mentioned it.
I didn't know she'd make it
a topic of discussion.
I know, but I specifically
asked you not to.
(SIGHS)
Okay. Well, then why did
you let Jordan know about
your "epic failure"?
What?
She's...
It was about Lance.
Lance? What about...
You mean about his bio?
Oh, Harper.
Is that why we're here?
NYU fired me.
What?
Budget cuts.
Why would you
keep that from me?
Because I didn't
want to worry you.
I didn't want to
stress you out.
I was desperate.
Desperate for what?
We're fine.
We're not...
We're not fine.
I haven't written
a bestseller in years.
And our insurance is shit.
And these fertility
treatments...
We're supposed to
be in this together.
I'm scared.
I'm scared, too.
But it's not my fault
what happened before.
I didn't say it
was your fault.
That's how you act.
Well, you act like
nothing happened.
You act like nothing...
And the doctor told
you to take it easy,
and you're
always working, and...
And I'm afraid
we're gonna lose this...
Stop it.
Stop it.
I can have this baby.
I can have this baby.
Don't you think
I doubt myself sometimes, too?
Why couldn't I
carry my babies?
What's wrong with me?
Nothing's wrong with you.
You sure about that?
I'm not going to be famous,
run a network or
make a ton of money.
Robyn.
I know who I married.
Then act like it.
I try really hard.
I try really hard to be
positive and supportive.
But sometimes
I need that, too.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You have to stop
sneaking around.
If you want to
do Lance's bio,
then ask him.
No matter what he says,
it's going to be okay.
You have to believe that.
(URINATING)
Oh...
Jesus.
Shelby, what the hell
are you doing?
I'm using the bathroom.
Julian.
You seem so stressed.
I am.
And this is not helping.
I'm sorry.
Any luck finding
a new donor?
Not for the entire amount, no.
Well, I might be
able to help.
Why don't we just get
together and talk about
it and have dinner?
Dinner?
Yeah.
I mean, I have to
see a business plan.
Can't we just
have lunch sometime?
I'm sorry, honey.
My money, my terms.
Wear something nice.
Shelby, Shelby, wait.
(SMACKS LIPS) Hmm.
God bless you.
Merry Christmas.
(COUGHING)
Mia.
Go back to bed.
Oh, my God.
Oh, no.
Cancer?
How long have you known?
About a year now.
Well, have you
tried everything?
You name it.
Traditional,
holistic, experimental.
It's just aggressive.
Why haven't you
told any of us?
Honestly, I...
I've been trying to
find the right moment
to say something,
but everything...
It's been so beautiful
and I didn't want to ruin it.
Other than our folks,
we haven't told anyone.
The kids know that
their mommy is sick, but...
They don't understand
what's about to happen.
Wait, wait, wait.
Don't talk like that now.
Listen. I'm doing my best
to be at peace with this.
But I need your help.
Lance, he hasn't
come to terms with this.
And when it hits
him that I'm...
(SIGHS)
I need you to
be there for him.
He needs you.
And you need him.
LANCE: Mia.
Harper knows, honey.
Why don't you go
back to bed, sweetie?
I'm okay. I'm okay.
Get some rest.
Okay.
Lance, I don't
know what to say.
Don't say anything.
Just keep it to yourself.
We're not trying to make
a big deal out of this.
But this is a big deal.
How do you expect
me to...
It's what we want.
Besides, you're good
at keeping secrets, right?
Well, there's got to be
something else you can do.
I mean, you can't give up.
We're not giving up.
It's God's turn.
He'll see her through this.
We're praying every day.
You're praying?
Are you serious?
Mmm.
So you're still
that guy, huh?
"Sometimes you got
to step out on faith."
You remember?
Or was that just some
bullshit that you were
feeding me then?
No, no.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Mia's going to be fine.
We are all going
to bear witness
to a miracle.
You'll see.
Get some sleep.
Yeah.
CANDACE: Baby, can you just...
Baby, move your leg.
Okay, here we go.
Stop, stop. Candace?
Candace. Stop.
What?
What?
Just stop.
What is the matter?
I thought I heard something.
No. I didn't
hear anything.
Yeah.
I think the kids...
The kids are sleeping.
Come on, baby.
Please, just lie there
and relax.
Sure.
Okay.
Yes.
And let Candy take
care of you. Okay?
(CANDACE MOANING)
Is that what you used to say
to your customers?
What did you just say?
CANDACE: Girls!
JULIAN: Candace.
Girls!
Candace!
Keisha! Kelly! Girls!
Candace, wait. Wait!
Why?
Everyone already
knows I'm a ghetto-ass
dick-sucking, stripping ho!
Right?
Yes! We do.
MIA: Shelby!
Really?
Keisha, Kelly,
go get your stuff.
Come on, Kelly.
And, bitch, you best
not say another
motherfucking word!
"Motherfucking word."
Upstairs.
Trick!
No! I am not
staying here!
Let's go upstairs!
Can somebody please tell
me why he chose this
five-dollar ho over me?
Shut up, Shelby!
Just shut up!
You shut up, Julian!
Shut up.
No. You fucking
shut up, bitch!
You were a fucking finalist
on <i> Flavor of Love</i> All-Stars!
You tongue-kissed
nasty-ass Flavor Flav
on national fucking
television, whore.
Yeah, but I didn't
swallow dick for tips,
you dirty skank.
Yes, you did.
You lonely,
miserable bitch!
It's called
fucking alimony!
JULIAN: Oh, my God!
MIA: Shelby!
Fucking bitch!
Oh, my God.
Jesus!
Get off of me!
Fuck you!
Stop. Stop!
You dirty bitch!
Fuck you!
Dirty bitch! Let me go!
Shelby, stop!
Lance! Get off of me!
Please! Please.
Stop it!
Are you happy now?
(GRUNTS)
LANCE: Shelby.
CANDACE: Come on, girls! Now!
ROBYN: Candace?
CANDACE: Let's go!
ROBYN: Candace.
I'm so sorry.
Just get your stuff.
KEISHA: I don't wanna go.
I like it here.
Mommy?
What?
Are you okay?
Oh, baby...
Honey, I'm sorry.
Don't cry, baby.
This doesn't feel
like Christmas to me.
Oh, baby.
Mommy's sorry, honey.
Mommy's sorry.
Mia?
Babe.
Mia?
Mommy's sorry.
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
What did you say?
No, I'm good.
I'm sorry.
Thought you were...
Said something.
Man, you know what?
Look on the
bright side, man.
If you and Candy
ever get into some
money problems,
you might be able to
put her in the ring.
She's got a hell
of a right hook.
(CHUCKLES)
<i>Million Dollar Baby.</i>
Wow.
You're an asshole.
I'm an asshole?
You're an asshole!
No wonder you
hooked up with Shelby.
You two deserve each other.
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think you gave her
that video on purpose.
That shit hurt
my feelings, man.
And lucky for you,
you do know better.
Yeah? How am I supposed
to know better, huh?
You just love
stirring the pot.
Watching people
sweat and squirm.
Just like you did years ago
with Harper's book.
Whoa. Hey. Don't bring...
You don't got to
talk about that.
Always messing around!
What Harper put in his book
ain't got shit to do with me!
You put yourself
in this predicament.
Shelby had it out for Candy
the moment she got there.
Q. Come on, man.
And it was your bama ass
that married a stripper!
Deal with it. Damn it.
Ah! Praying Mantis!

Fucking Murch!
Yo! Hey!
He's biting me!
He's biting me!
I'm Tiger Claw!
Hey, hey. Hold up.
You don't use

You can't use Monkey Paw!
That ain't fair!
I'm sick of you!
Y'all need to act
like you got some sense!
No Monkey Paw!
Take your hat!
Screaming Monkey!
You call her stripper again,
I'll Screaming
Monkey all over your ass!
Y'all mess up my saddle,
you're gonna be Monkey

back to the house!
JULIAN: Just don't mess
up his stuff, man!

I hope you die.

No.
It's not okay.

Okay. Thank you.
Get some sleep.
Okay.
(SOBBING)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
Come on, y'all.
I'm fine.
It's cool.
I'm good.
No, Murch.
LANCE: I appreciate you all.
HARPER: <i> "In a world beyond</i>

(INHALES DEEPLY)
(COUGHING)
Damn.
You're ruining my
good-girl image.
I won't tell
if you don't.
Puff.
Pass.
Déjà vu, huh?
Your mom.
I was 13.
And my daddy.
He just kept working,
you know.
That's what he does.
"Got to make the money,
got to make the money,
"got to make the money."
It's funny. She just...
She was so strong like you.
And she never let
anybody know that
she was sick, you know.
One day she was
there, and then...
Hey.
Who's going to be
around for you, Q?
Somebody.
I don't know.
I'm alone, but I ain't...
Trust me, I ain't lonely.
I appreciate you, brother.
And I love you, sis.
Amen.
Hey.
Hey.
You okay?
Not really.
You talk to Candace?
Text.
I hate texts.
How's Kennedy?
Is she okay?
Despite how bad
a mother I am?
Yes.
I didn't say that.
I did.
I don't have one
maternal bone in my body.
All I do is criticize
her because she's not me.
Who the hell am I?
That is such
a loaded question.
Thanks for the
compassion, honey.
I'm not your honey.
I'm not here for you
like that anymore, Shelby.
I'm sorry.
This night
couldn't get any worse.
That medicinal
weed is no joke.
Ugh! I was wrong.
It's dark.
(CHUCKLES)
HARPER: Wow.
JORDAN: You like it?
Yeah. How did you do this?
Once I understood
what was really going
on with your book,
I wanted to inspire you.
Actually one of
Brian's colleagues
put the mock-up together.
B-Mac.
What could have been, huh?
Do me a favor and
after you send me a copy,
just make sure
you delete that.
Because I don't
want it to be taken
out of context.
Well, you can
delete it yourself.
Merry Christmas.
Yeah. It's about time
you caught up with
the rest of the world.
I don't know.
There's something
about pen and paper.
It's just...
When I'm finished,
I know it's real.
I can touch it.
Mmm. I get that.
It's like your baby.
Yeah.
Yeah. That used
to be one of my
favorite metaphors.
Mmm.
I'm sorry, hon.
You're fine. You're fine.
Don't worry about it.
You must be hyped to
get to Hawaii, huh?
I don't know.
Kind of doesn't feel like
I should be going anywhere.
Oh, right.
I don't think I
can leave until...
Hey, hey.
I'm losing my best friend.
I know.
And she tries, you know.
She calls, she emails.
And I'm just,
Jordan's always
just too damn busy.
You didn't know.
I should have known.
Now, I just feel
like I'm just too late.
You know, I just feel like...
(SOBBING)
Now I just feel like
I'm too late and what...
It's okay.
It's okay.
You are here now.
So is she.
As long as she's still here,
you're right on time.
I love you, Harper.
Love you, too.
I love you, too.
(SIGHS)
Wait, Robyn. This is...
Oh, no. Shit. Robyn?
Robyn, please,
it's not what you...
I know Mia's sick!
Robyn, be careful.
Robyn.
Leave me alone.
Listen to me.
I swear. Robyn?
I swear, Robyn.
What? What could
you possibly swear?
That I didn't
see what I thought?
That it's complicated?
Well, yeah, kind of...
Am I making too much noise?
No, no, man.
You're good. Yeah.
Okay.
It was third and
long in Dallas.
Cowboy Nation was in a frenzy.
I was nervous, excited.
Iso lead was the play.
Took it right up the gut. Pow.
Knocked the snot out of me.
But not before
I moved those chains.
First down.
Cowboy Nation
just fell silent.
You're a bad man.
Yeah, it felt good, man.
It felt good.
I knew I belonged then.
You couldn't stop me
from bragging, boy.
Then you came up
that week after that.
Remember?
Yeah, with Murch.
That's a weekend
I will never forget.
On the bus we came up.
Yeah, man.
But we had good times.
Once you guys got there
we had a good time.
Yeah, we did.
And Quentin was
crying about...
Because somebody threw up
in his brand-new...
Yeah, it was Murch.
Murch threw up.
Q was mixing his drinks.
He paid for that.
Do you mind
taking this turkey
over there?
You want this one
or this one?
That one is good.
You sure that's not
too heavy for you?
I can handle it.
I can handle it.
(INDISTINCT CHATTING)
Merry Christmas.
Here you go.
QUENTIN: Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Oh!
(GIGGLING)
Everybody having
a good time here?
WOMAN: Very good.
Lemon or red velvet?
Red velvet.
Okay. There you go.
That's a special
lady you got there.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Why don't you stop
staring so hard, brah?
Look like that
thirsty-ass
freshman you were
before I had to
raise your game up.
Oh, come on.
I was not that bad.
Hi.
It's all going so well.
I remember you
gave me a crib sheet.
Looks like old
times over there.
Thanks, Uncle Quentin.
Can I leave now?
SHELBY: Good night, LJ.
Get out of this doggone suit.
Don't take it off yet.
Kennedy likes
light-skinned Santa.
So does her momma.
You know you wanna
sit on Santa's lap.
Shut up.
L. Can I get
a ride with you, man?
I got you, man.
I'm hitting
the bathroom first.
Hey, babe.
Hey.
I'm gonna go warm
up the car. All right?
Okay.
Julian, would you mind
giving me a ride
back to the house?
Sure.
Thanks. I'll be in the car.
I'm floored. I'm amazed.
You know what they say,
"The Lord works..."
"In mysterious ways."
"God, Family, Football"?
What the hell is this?
Oh, no.
Uh...
God. Lance,
this isn't what
it looks like.
I invited you to my house!
I let you back in.
I let you back in and...
MIA: Wait a minute, Lance.
Now. At this time.
No. You wait a minute.
Look at this.
Don't read that.
"First pro yards,
guiding principles..."
Trying to get at my kids!
Lance!
All that bullshit, babe.
Just go to the car.
You let me handle this.
You hear me?
I got this.
Mia...
Don't you say a
motherfucking thing to her.
You ain't nothing
but a goddamn
snake in the grass.
That's what you are.
You stay away from me.
You stay away from my family!
Forever this time.
You hear me? Forever!
Come on.
Calm down.
Just... Let's go.
Listen.
I can't believe I...
Lance, talk to me.
Little sneaky snake.
No, no. I'm done talking.
Just get in the car.
(ENGINE STARTING)
What did you do now?
And you think it'll
fit with the luggage?
Yeah. Perfect.
Yeah? Okay.
BOTH: Daddy!
What the!
Hello!
Oh, my gosh!
I missed you so much!
Look at you.
How was Grandma's?
Was it fun?
GIRL: Yes.
Hey, girls,
you want some hot chocolate?
BOTH: Yes!
Mommy, can we?
Please, please, please!
Just for a little while.
BOTH: Yay!
Can we talk?
I am going to resign, Julian.
Absolutely not.
No.
Candace, listen to me.
The school does
not work without you.
We can find another way.
Together.
Listen. I don't
care what happened.
Because I love you.
(SNIFFLING)
I needed the money. Okay?
Okay.
Okay.
And for the record,
it was once.
I was young and I was stupid,
and I was drunk!
Babe...
Stop.
But I have moved on
and I am those girls' mother.
And Julian,
I am your wife.
Come to me first.
Yes, baby. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
You and those girls
are my entire life.
Just please forgive me.
Please.
I guess.
Baby.
I love you, Julian.
I am so sorry.
CANDACE: I love you.
Lance, calm down.
How can I calm down?
I let my guard down.
I let my guard down!
I got sucker-punched. Again!
We don't know
the full story...
I know enough of the story.
You think you do.
But we won't know
until we speak
with Harper.
No. Fuck Harper! Fuck him!
Right.
There it is.
You're so filled
with anger that you...
And it's all aimed
at him, but we all
played a part in it.
No. No, Mia.
We have never had
this discussion before,
and we are not about
to start right now!
Tell me how
angry you are at me.
I deserve it.
No.
I knew what I was doing.
I knew I was wrong.
And I knew it would hurt you.
And I'm sorry for that.
And I'm sorry
that I chose him.
It's my fault what
it's done to you two.
And I can't rest knowing
that you're still
holding on to this.
You chose him?
It's weighing you down.
You need to let go.
You need him.
I don't need him.
Yeah.
Yeah, you do.
You need to forgive.
I will never forgive him.
I need you to.
Lance, look at me.
I called us a car, man.
You should go on.
I'll probably just end up
staying here or something.
That was some
melodramatic shit.
Guess you're off
your high horse now,
ain't you?
So, you're just gonna
kick me when I'm down, huh?
I told you,
karma's a bitch, man.
I deserve this.
No. Ain't nobody
deserve misery.
But it's just
your turn now.
See, that's exactly why
I don't tell people shit.
And how's that helped you?
Look, your marriage
is on the rocks,
you tried to exploit
your best friend
for financial gain,
and you got
a low sperm count.
I don't have a low sperm...
(CHUCKLING)
Oh. Fuck it.
Don't lie to Santa.
And don't be embarrassed, man.
It's just weird.
Because you rarely
hear about brothers
in the hood with
fertility issues.
Especially with
"Baby mama drama this,
"and baby mama that."
I get it. I get it.
What I'm saying, Joe,
no matter how big
of a fiasco today
was with Lance,
you're gonna be
all right, man.
How can you be so sure?
Because I'm Q, baby.
Now, seriously,
do you need something?
We're worried
about you, man.
Do you need some money?
Yeah.
I got you. Okay?
You just got to
promise me one thing.
Yeah?
Just one time,
call me Daddy.
(LAUGHING)
Come on, Joe.
Let's go home, man.
Shit.
I love you, man.

<i>we're playing an epic</i>

I can't say that
I'm liking it.
Listen, Brian,
I'm really sorry
for what I said.
I miss you.
And I wish you were here.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Hello?
Hi.
Damnedest thing,
none of my devices
were working, so...
Baby.
LANCE: <i> I'm not going</i>
<i>to play today.</i>
Don't try to change my mind.
Honey...
No, I need to
be here for you.
Honey, this is your
gift to the world.
It'll touch so many people
and lift so many spirits.
Baby, you're gonna
be known as the
greatest ever to...
No. No.
I don't care about that.
You are the only
thing that I care
about right now.
This just isn't fair, babe.
It's not fair.
It's his will.
It's his will.
You have been so strong.
And I didn't think...
I didn't allow
myself to think that...
Go play.
Go play and make us proud.
I'll be here
when you get back.
I promise.
Yeah, you're right.
I should not have come
here and been dishonest.
Yeah, you think?
But you know what?
I'm glad I did.
Yeah.
Because in the
past couple of days,
we've talked more
than we have in years.
I mean, we used
to be best friends.
And now, I...
I want that back.
And I think you do, too.
This has nothing to
do with a book or...
You're my boy.
And I miss you.
Why should I believe you?
Because all I have is my word.
Literally.
It's all I've got.
She wants me to play today.
That actually
makes sense to me.
In what way? How?
Because it's you, Lance.
God, family, football.
Did you pray on it?
My mind's made up.
I think Mia's
mind is made up too.
She pretty much trumps
you right about now.
You're not just
playing for you,
or your team or the fans.
You're playing for all of us.
I mean, you know,
not me, but...
You play for Mia.
August, Hope,
little LJ and Faith.
And on Christmas
you play for him.
I hate you, man.
I really hate you.
I know.
But you'll hate yourself more
if you don't ask him.
You should ask him.
He listens to you.
Do you need me
to pray with you?
Hold your hand?
Read Scripture?
Man, get the
hell out of here.
Okay. I'm not even here.
(ON TV)
<i>Hi, everyone, I'm Greg Gumbel</i>
<i>alongside Eddie George,</i>
<i>and we are live this evening,</i>
<i>for the New York Giants</i>
<i>and the Atlanta Falcons.</i>
<i>A game that will not only</i>
<i>determine the division,</i>
<i>but could be</i>
<i>a significant step</i>
<i>for the ageless</i>
<i>veteran Lance Sullivan.</i>
<i>And tonight he is</i>
<i>poised to break</i>
<i>the all-time rushing record.</i>
GREG: <i> 176 yards</i>
<i>is a tall order.</i>
EDDIE: <i> Well, miracles</i>
<i>do happen. It's Christmas.</i>
GREG: <i> The give is to Sullivan.</i>
<i>Hit at the line of scrimmage.</i>
<i>Driven back.</i>
<i>That will be a loss</i>
<i>of two on the play.</i>
<i>Atlanta's saying</i>
<i>it's not going to</i>
<i>be easy tonight.</i>
<i>They're going to</i>
<i>make it a point</i>
<i>to stop him hard.</i>
GREG: <i> Second down now and 12.</i>
<i>Ellis.</i>
<i>Screen to the left side.</i>
<i>And Sullivan is run over</i>
<i>at his own 10 yard line!</i>
<i>That's a loss</i>
<i>of another eight.</i>
<i>The Dirty Bird defense</i>
<i>is nasty, physical.</i>
<i>They're going to</i>
<i>make it very hard</i>
<i>to get this rushing record.</i>
GREG: <i> Third down and 20.</i>
<i>The give is to Sullivan.</i>
<i>Left side.</i>
<i>What a move to the outside!</i>
<i>Breaks free across the 20.</i>
<i>Across the 30!</i>
(GRUNTING)
<i>Hit! And he lost the football.</i>
<i>Covered by Atlanta!</i>
<i>He's definitely in</i>
<i>the Christmas spirit.</i>
<i>Giving away the football</i>
<i>to that Atlanta defense.</i>
<i>And a frustrating</i>
<i>evening continues</i>
<i>for Lance Sullivan.</i>
Jordan, could you hand me
the phone, please?
Come on, Dad.
Hold on to the football!
Let's go!
MAN 1: You ain't breaking
no records like that!
GREG: <i> And that frustration</i>
<i>boiling over now</i>
<i>on the sideline.</i>
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
<i>You cannot do that.</i>
Mia, is everything okay?
No, we're...
I don't think I...
Get those cameras
out of my face!
Okay, okay, I will try.
You suck!
Lance, Lance? First off,
thanks for the seats.
The seats are amazing,
the game looks great.
Mia's on the
phone for you.
What's up, baby? You okay?
No, I'm just...
Yeah, I'm trying to focus.
MAN 2: Get off the phone, man!
Come on, D! Big down
right here! Big down!
Give me the ball, Coach.
You're done, L.
Take a seat.
Coach, give me the ball.
GREG: <i> With a half that</i>
<i>he and his team</i>
<i>would like to</i>
<i>forget behind him now,</i>
<i>Lance Sullivan lines up again</i>
<i>in the backfield.</i>
EDDIE: <i> He's going to</i>
<i>have to turn it on</i>
<i>in order to get a victory,</i>
<i>and walk away with</i>
<i>the rushing record.</i>
GREG: <i> The give is to Sullivan.</i>
<i>Up the middle,</i>
<i>skips a tackler,</i>
<i>dodges another tackler.</i>
<i>Stiff-arm!</i>
<i>And he's off to the races!</i>
<i>Breaks free in the open field.</i>
Come on, baby.
<i>Twenty, 10, 5...</i>
Come on, come on!
<i>Touchdown Giants!</i>
EDDIE: <i> And a beautiful run</i>
<i>by Lance Sullivan.</i>
<i>Sullivan, 65 yards.</i>
<i>He must have bathed</i>
<i>in the fountain of</i>
<i>youth at halftime.</i>
Girl, what did
you say to him?
I told him what I
wanted for Christmas.
Well, it worked.
GREG: <i> Lance Sullivan is</i>
<i>just eating up yardage.</i>
<i>He is attacking</i>
<i>this Atlanta defense.</i>
<i>This is a night you</i>
<i>live for as a running back.</i>
<i>Is that a 15-year</i>
<i>veteran doing that?</i>
Did you see that, Murch?
It was like this!
ANNOUNCER:
<i>26-yard gain. First down.</i>
Yeah, that's right!
Let's go, boy!
I'm young! I'll be back!
Yeah, let's go!
GREG: <i> Sullivan out</i>
<i>of the backfield,</i>
<i>takes the pass.</i>
EDDIE: <i> He's got a chance to</i>
<i>get this record break.</i>
GREG: <i> Timeout Atlanta.</i>
<i>We'll be back.</i>
J?
Mmm.
Do you remember
Janice Burroughs?
Three years behind,
Pocahontas hair,
real pretty,
smooth cinnamon skin.
She had a big ol' booty
and she used to
smile like this.
(CHUCKLES)
I know exactly who
you're talking about.
I hated her.
Me, too!
Lance can get remarried,
but not to her.
You got me?
Yeah.
GREG: <i> This has been an</i>
<i>unbelievable second half</i>
<i>for Lance Sullivan.</i>
KIDS: Yes!
AUGUST: Go on, Dad.
I don't want to
let you down, Mia.
Look at them.
Titi J,
you are their
godmother for a reason.
And you have to
be open to love.
Okay?
Got it.
You're going to be fine.
GREG: <i> Seven seconds</i>

<i>Fourth and goal.</i>
<i>The Giants down five.</i>
<i>A touchdown here wins it.</i>
EDDIE: <i> Greg, as a player,</i>
<i>this is the moment</i>

<i>Fourth and goal.</i>
<i>It's going to come down</i>

GREG: <i> The defense shifts.</i>
<i>Here we go.</i>
Okay.
Come on, man,
come on!
Red 80!
Go!
<i>The snap.</i>
<i>The give is to Sullivan.</i>
<i>To the right side.</i>
<i>Hit inside</i>

You're good every time.

Hey.
You did it.
Yeah.
I did it.

I love you, Lance Sullivan.
I love you.
I love you so much.

Hey. I'll see
you over there.
Hey, Harp.
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Harper.
Listen, before
I'm all crazed and
hopped up on Valium,
I wanted to give you this.
What's this?
It's your
Christmas miracle.
Shelby, I can't.
You can. And you will.
Can we just arrange
some playdates
for the girls?
Sure.
Thank you.
Okay.
I'm sorry.

Excuse me.
Mia Morgan Sullivan
was one of the greatest people
any of us has ever known.
Even though none of
us wanted to believe
she would be here,
she knew.
<i>She knew she would.</i>
Take your time.
Come on, babies.
<i>She made sure that we</i>
<i>would all be here, too.</i>
Not to mourn death,
but to celebrate life.
Being with her in the days
leading to her home-going,
was the greatest gift
any of us have ever received.
Because of her,
we are friends for life.
<i>Because of her, we're family.</i>
Kennedy, where...
HARPER: Mia was,
and is an angel.
It's tragically
ironic that the day
we received the Son of God,
<i>he called one of</i>
<i>his daughters home.</i>
I know that God has a plan.
I know.
But this one...
This one is
really hard to accept.
(SIGHS)

She can't go.
She can't go.
No, she can't go,
she can't go.
She can't go, she can't.
She can't go.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Baby, do you want me
to fix you a plate?
The potato salad is great.
Have you seen my mom?
(SIGHS)
Why do we keep doing this?
Who knows?
Maybe it's in the stars.
Quentin, we're both
emotional right now.
This is not
a love connection.
What if it is?
I wonder what
would happen if...
If you and I really
gave it a shot.
Oh, hell no.
Where's my underwear?
You didn't wear any.
Oh, yeah.
That was nice.
You're disgusting.
Hey, L.
Robyn and I are
about to take off.
Do you need anything?
No, I'm good, man, thanks.
Okay.
That was a
great eulogy, man.
It was perfect.
Thanks.
Whatever he's doing up there,
I don't know,
I just don't think
it's fair, man.
I don't think
I can have faith in
something like that.
I hear you, man.
But he's always there.
That's why you'll
always be the better man.
Thanks for the baby clothes.
And keep in touch.
All right.
I'm going to go

Do you need anything?
I'm fine, honey. Thanks.

I just... Oh!
Oh, my God,
you're in labor.
ROBYN: No, no, I'm not.
Just help me up so
I can go to the bathroom.
Oh!
Oh, my God, it's happening.
Harper!
(MOANING IN PAIN)
Okay. How far apart
are the contractions?
They're about 10 minutes.
HARPER: She said
about 10 minutes.
Lance, hurry.
We're about 45
minutes at least.
JORDAN: Just breathe,
Robyn, just breathe.
Not anymore, Harp.
HARPER: Oh, no.
What the hell?
You're doing great.
Just hang in there, baby.
Harp?
Yeah?
Hop out. We got to talk.
(YELLS)
Okay, what's up?
This baby ain't
gonna wait, okay?
The contractions
are too close.
I'm gonna call my doctor.
He delivered all my
kids and I trust him.
Okay, great.
Hold on, Harp.
I got to check her cervix.
Come again?
He's gonna need to
talk me through this
in case things
get a little hairy.
I mean, critical.
I know,
but you're not a doctor.
I know. Look, Harp,
I was there for all my kids.
The nurses taught
me how to measure.
And I know my way
around a vagina.
It was a joke.
Just trying to
lighten the mood.
Okay, but the baby's breech.
I got you, Harp, okay?
Everything's
gonna be all right.
All right,
I should tell Robyn.
I heard! Just do it!
Let's go!
Robyn, I'm just gonna
measure, that's all.
Just gonna measure.
NELSON: (ON PHONE)
<i>How dilated is she?</i>
About eight
and a half, nine.
<i>Robyn, you're doing great.</i>
It hurts.
<i>I know.</i>
Hang in there.
<i>Lance, you're gonna</i>
<i>have to deliver this baby.</i>
(MOANS LOUDLY)
Oh, boy.
It's a breech baby, Doc.
<i>Okay. Get here as</i>
<i>fast as humanly possible,</i>
<i>but if you can't...</i>
Wait, you're breaking up, Doc.
Doctor Nelson!
Doctor Nelson!
No, no! Oh, God.
We must be in a bad area.
What the fuck?
Yeah, you think?
(SCREAMING)
Move out of the way, Grandma!
Hang in there, baby.
Lance, I was supposed
to have a C-section.
I didn't want to be cut,
but I want you to cut me.
What? No, no, no, baby.
No one's gonna
cut you, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Right, Harp?
Right, Harp?
Right, yeah.
Everything's gonna be
fine, baby. All right?
You're doing great.
Robyn, on this
next contraction,
I want you to push, okay?
Are you with me?
You're gonna
push, okay?
Okay.
Here it comes.
Push.
(GRUNTS)
Okay, go.
Push, baby, push!
Oh, shit!
How's she doing?
I got the feet.
He's got the feet.
Feet!
He's got the feet.
Oh, God! It's feet!
Just like Faith.
You're doing real good.
I got to find the cord.
HARPER: Oh, my God.
Here comes another one.
No, no, no, don't push, okay?
Just breathe.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Look at me, Robyn.
Breathe.
Baby, I love you.
I am so in love
with you, okay?
(HORN HONKING)
Fuck you!
You're doing really great.
Lance, please.
Please.
CANDACE: Hang on, Robyn.
(BABY CRYING)
It's a girl.
Okay.
(SIGHS)
How you doing?
Hi, Mom. Are you okay?
ROBYN: God, she's beautiful.
She's beautiful.
Thank you.
WOMAN: She's beautiful.
I love you.
I love you.
Hi.
What's up?
What's happening, y'all?
Congratulations.
Thank you.
You guys...
Oh, my gosh!
Auntie Shelby's here!
Q, Q, Q!
Can we be in it, too?
Thank you, bro.
Thank you,
I appreciate it.
(BABY CRYING)
"Let me go to Momma."
WOMAN: What's wrong?
Precious.
Hey, cutie.
You're adorable.
Perfect.
Cute little nose.
So precious.
ROBYN: <i> Harper,</i>
<i>you have a package.</i>
LANCE: That's your
first edition, huh?
Yeah, man.
Thank you, Lance.
Thank you.
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
It's Q.
Put that fool on speaker, man.
What's happening, Q?
We got you on speaker.
What up, Q?
QUENTIN: <i> Fellas.</i>
Quentin's getting married.
Yeah! And Harp,
I want you to be
my best man.
<i>But one thing.</i>
You better not
have fucked her.
(CRYING)
Yeah, it's time.
