Cashier Wang
You're all early, l am slightly late today
Has Master summoned us yet?
No
You've come in good time
Sit, rest a while
Sit...
Let's all be seated
Has Master come out yet?
Yes, he's in the sitting room
All these skills l have
What are they good for?
Golden sword
You know old master made his name with it
before the Qing regime
Yuans Golden Sword is
famous in the martial arts world
but even if l have inherited his skills
what am l to do with them?
How could l withstand guns and cannons?
The Guan family are also martial artists
and run a security bureau
But they have no business either
That's because of the
invention of trains & steam ships
no one needs a security bureau
to escort goods anymore
That's true
Kung fu...
forget it
Call them in
Yes
Master calls for Cashier Qin of the bank
Yes
Mr Zheng of the pawn shop
Yes
Cashier Zhuo of the silk shop
Yes
Cashier Wang of the restaurant
Yes
Master will not see the others today
come and wait for your turn tomorrow
Chief Li
Business...so bothersome
Master is talented, such a large business
others even with their utmost efforts
can't manage it
but you do it so well and effortlessly
Everyone admires the
brilliant management of your business
Oh, talking of which
you should note one thing
Guan's security bureau
is between our bank and the silk shop
lt is inconvenient
l have instructed Qin Fu and Zhuo Bing Nan
to buy off the bureau
All our shops will then be linked
Yes, but the old Guan has passed away
and his son is somewhat obstinate
l know,
that's why l ask you to take care of it
Yes
l'll keep you posted
lt's a small matter, we'll fix it
Are you in the mood
for some entertainment?
What? Are there any fighters?
You have guessed it
Those martial artists have nowhere to
earn a living in this day and age
Once they hear Yuans Golden Sword
they are like flies that have seen blood
Who are they?
They are upstarts
but they enjoy a modicum of fame
l have instructed
for them to be brought here
lnside please
Altogether seven men
One is called Chen Qing
Five brothers from the Meng family
Meng Long, Meng Hu, Meng Pao
Meng Biao, Meng Jiao
and Lui Jing from Guan Tung
He might possess the
best kung fu skills among them all
Bring me the Golden Sword
Yes
Chief Li
Sorry to keep you waiting
Master Yuan will be here soon,
please sit...
He is Mister Yuan
Greetings
Master, Mr. Chen
Mr. Lui
The Meng brothers
Please sit
Your fame precedes you
Master Yuan is a descendent of
the hero Golden Sword
lt's our honour to meet you
Chief Li says you are seeking a position
Yes, l hear the Yuan family is recruiting
martial artists
You're too kind
l just wanted to find someone
to practise with me
The golden swords have been left by
my late father
as l'm sure you must have heard of
Of course, old master Yuan used
the 49 techniques
of Golden Sword to make his name
Every martial artist knows this
Well said
l would like to see your kung fu
l'll just make one strike to each of you
Whoever can handle it
will be my honoured guest
The first move is
Golden Wheel Faces the Sun
Who will accept this challenge?
l'll try
Please, Mr Chen
Come on, Mr Yuan
Mr. Yuan, even if Mr. Chen failed
you needn't have killed him
l didn't make the second strike
He has his own incompetence to blame
lf you think
you can't accept the challenge
it's not too late to back out
The five of you can attack together
if you like
l'll only strike each of you once
Only five moves for five of you
how about that?
Let's go, if we don't even dare
to take his one strike
how could we face others?
Spoken like a true hero
Mr Yuan, come on
l'll use '5 Clouds Worship the Sun',
altogether 7 moves
The first move is
Cloud from the Nine Heavens
Cloud Lifts from the Feet
Clouds Over an Angry Sea
Clouds Out of the Wind,
Meeting the Sun
Your swordsmanship is really deadly
but you are too cruel
Nonsense, did l use one move too many?
l admire your kung fu
but why did you have to
kill all the Meng brothers?
Killing one or five...
it makes no difference
they dared to come with such poor skills
Martial artists hold no future
in the present times
But the hero Golden Sword
was known for his magnanimity
This doesn't seem like
coming from his descendent
Whatever
Besides, no outsider would know
what happened today
You want to silence me as well?
See if you could
deal with this blow of mine
This is the sixth move called...
Rotations of the Sun Wheel
Good, you escaped
but by what you said
l would have to make one more strike
Look, the Sun Shines on Everywhere
''Wu Wei Security Bureau''
''The Yuan Bank''
Get out, l won't sell
lt's out of good intention
that Master Yuan
wants to buy your old security bureau
l don't think so
he wants the land on which
the bureau stands
No
lt's because...
Because of what?
Say what he said
or he'll beat us to death
He wants your property
You...if you cause Master Yuan
to come himself
then you'll...
l am the only one not afraid of him
if he comes
l'll make him change his surname to Fang
and beat his head
into a square (same sound as Fang)
then beat it back into a ball again
Master
You are the Yuan fellow?
You...
l tell you, the bureau is not for sale
Just name your price
l won't sell, but...
l'll exchange it for one thing
What?
Your head looks good
How about an exchange with your head?
Good, that's exactly what l hoped to hear
Brother
mom has asked for you
Brother
Okay, you're lucky this time
What are you looking at?
''Ming Xiang Restaurant''
You seem to be lucky
From the cashier to the
waiter of this restaurant
they are all small and skinny
lt wouldn't be a heavy beating
Let's go
Sir, one dollar and forty three cents
Come, men
What's the matter?
Eating for free
Beat him
Stop, l'll pay for him
Stop
He Fei, something's wrong
Feng Jia Ji should be finished
being beaten by now
Yes, l am hungry again
You're always hungry
Get lost
They used so much force
even if we didn't pay
there's no need for such severity
Forget it, we deserve it
You even complain of their food
They used sticks to beat me
Had someone not intervened
they might have used knives!
Who helped you?
l didn't see clearly
l only heard him say that he'll pay
Waiter, the bill
Two dollars and eighty cents
One dollar and four cents
is from the bill of that guy
l said l'll pay for him
Alright
Come on
You...
Another one trying to eat without paying
Beat him
Murder
You can't pay and yet you say
you'll pay for others?
lt's you who can't kill me, not my fault
Careful, whoever touches this stick dies
''Yuan Feng Restaurant''
He Fei, from morning until now
we passed through 3 towns
and 8 restaurants and
you all don't let me in,
you say this one won't do also
You don't want me killed by that fat man
No, every time it's his turn
to take a beating
he evades it
Alright, this one then
lf l were killed
it might benefit you
How?
Cook and eat me
Look here...and here
Quite some meat
lf you don't want to take a beating
then pawn these swords
No
lt seems nothing works for you
Don't ever ask me
to pawn these swords again
Don't think l'll continue to be poor
The swords have been left by my ancestors
Forget it
Forget it...my stomach wouldn't forget it
Okay, this one
Not bad
These people are not easy to deal with
l'll take your place
What do you mean?
We agreed to take turns
l can't take advantage of you
Feng Jia Ji is quite a friend
You...
Go...wait at the door
Waiter
Coming
Total...
No need to count
Come altogether...
Wait, l'll bring the cashier
lt's him
You don't have money?
Come on, beat me
No need for a beating
even if you can't pay
Did l hear that right?
Yes, but you can't leave by these stairs
you have tojump from this window
l see, there'll be over a dozen people
waiting from me downstairs
Nobody's going to beat you, jump
l have been to many places
but have never heard of
such a good restaurant
You'd better give me a beating
l ate but didn't pay
lt's better to settle this
so we don't owe each other
Come, hit me
You must have overeaten
Our boss said
good martial artists
don't eat without paying
unless they are hard pressed by poverty
Yes
He also respects those with great skill
That's why you have tojump
l haven't eaten for free
l'll let you beat me but you wouldn't
What's the name of your boss?
Yuan Ying Fei the Golden Sword
Then thanks, l might be back
The fried shrimps were not bad
Thank you
What's all that about down below?
lf you have real kung fu you needn't worry
if not, and if you hurt yourself
that's your business
He Fei
My bones have been broken by them
So painful, don't touch me
lt's my fault
l shouldn't have forced you
into that restaurant
l should have taken your place
at least l am stronger than you
You do have a conscience
You...
l was lucky
that restaurant didn't beat people
Let's stay here
and eat there everyday
He Fei
l tell you
the boss of that restaurant told me...
''God of Chivalry Temple''
We eat without paying
and if we're beaten up
we don't owe each other
The owner respects martial artists
if we return we are less than human
Yes, we owe them this meal
Keep worrying about it
lf we go again tomorrow
they'll think we're
eating without paying again
l'll pawn these swords
we'll pay for today's meal too
He Fei, are you reluctant to let go?
Frankly,
although this axe isn't worth any money
l really don't want to lose it
ln any event we are all from rich families
You the hatchet are from the Zeng family,
He's Feng, the iron leg
My family has also
run a security bureau in the past
my father was the chief when he was alive
and achieved much success
with these swords
As kids we practised
nothing but kung fu
and we know nothing else
To crown it all,
there're now guns and cannons
and kung fu is useless
''Pawn Shop''
How much do you want?
20 dollars
Not worth that much
15 dollars then
Not worth that much
Then how much would you say it's worth?
30 cents for a pair of rusted swords
Look with your damned eyes
this is my family heirloom
lf you utter the word 'rotten' again
l'll try them on you
Alright, 20 dollars then, pay him
Yes
Rotten...
Beg your pardon?
No...20 dollars
for the pair of precious swords
Good swords
Who was the owner?
A young and fierce chap
He must be an exceptional martial artist
to own such good swords
When he redeems them, introduce him to me
Yes, l know you like making new friends
that's why l have brought the swords
Okay
Have you sent gifts to Miss Guan?
Yes, but l fear
the result would still be the same
Get out
if l see you again l'll break your legs
We're here to deliver presents
Scram
Oh, how harsh!
Brother
Go in
Brother
Shut up, you haven't seen them
they are like hungry dogs
focusing on a bone
What's the matter?
l feel strange
How did he get full this time
and walk out like this?
l'm full so why not leave?
Stay for a beating
Do we look like we eat for not paying?
Yes, indeed
You better not use weapon
one touch by my stick and you're history
Not gonna be that easy l guess
You are...
These people are not friends
to leave you to a beating,
l'll beat them up for you
Beat him up
l am hungry,
l'll deal with you after l've eaten
Upstairs please
Jump down, jump and you won't need to pay
l'll fall on those swords
lt's up to you
Eating without paying
l told you there are many people
with special talent
don't think they are so poor
to eat without paying
Don't look down on them either
Do let me in on any news of them
if there's any
Yes
Guan Yun gives us no face
Don't rush things
A rundown security bureau
is no big deal for us
What would you do afterwards?
Will Miss Guan like me then?
Guan Yun is the only obstacle
You'd get everything if it weren't for him
Agreed, but we can't fight him openly
do you understand?
Yes
A few martial artists have come into town
some look like experts
Pay attention to the restaurants
and pawn shops
The 20 dollars are gone,
what should we do tomorrow?
Eat for free at the Yuan restaurant again
l feel shameful to do so
Tomorrow we should
pawn your swords for good
and get a few more dollars
No, l must redeem them back
Besides, l wonder if they would take them!
Since you look down on my swords
l'll get 30 more dollars
to prove to you their value
Redeem your goods
22 dollars including interest
You've come to redeem the swords
My swords
Yes, get them here
Please take a look
l haven't come to redeem them,
but to sell them off
They're good swords &
must be worth more than 20 bucks
l know...our boss said
their owner must be a hero
and must be hard pressed for money
and if you come they should be returned
He also said
if you need money just ask
Keep the swords,
pawn it for another 30 dollars
30 dollars, count them
What's your boss's name?
Yuan Ying Fei
Oh, it's him again
You are hungry, take it
Please
What, what's wrong to buy you a meal?
After l eat my fill
l'll make you kowtow to me
By your ability?
Precisely
lf you touch my stick you're dead
A duel at God of Chivalry temple
then if you have guts
He who backs out is a bastard
l don't fight with a hungry man
Let's use weapons, that's more fun
than kicks & punches
No need
lf you touch my stick you're dead
Feng Jia Ji, fight or you're a bastard
lf l had my swords
l'll make you cry for mercy
Let's see who will cry for mercy
Please stop
Scram, none of your business
We are all friends and martial artists
Why do we fight each other?
Look, this gentleman here said
he is also a martial artist
l am Yuan Ying Fei,
l want to make friends with you
Please come to my home for a chat
We all know you are good to friends
You have great rules in your restaurant
if l were desperately hungry
l'll visit it again
But as regards going to your home, sorry
You better invite the three of them to go
Do we look like we're freeloaders?
l only want to share
kung fu experiences with you all
there's no other intention
l am no different from you
the only thing is
my late father left me some money
You know kung fu?
You too are a martial artist?
Haven't you heard of
Golden Sword Yuans family?
Of course l have
Hero Yuan was rich and good at sword skill
He was famous during the Qing regime
Five years ago
he died at the age of eighty
That's it
He is his son
Can you say if or not he knows kung fu?
Come, men
See?
Son of Golden Sword hero Yuan
You should be able to block
3 strikes of the stick
Alright, if you do
l'll go with you
Alright
One, two
The way you duck
if l hit you one more time
what would you do?
l naturally know what to do
Three
l have nowhere to go anyway
l'll come along to your place
Welcome
Please come in
Please try these foreign cigars
Please take a bath first
and after you've changed
he'll welcome you with a feast
Where's the bath?
Over there
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
These women
They are here to serve you in your bath
We'll do it ourselves
Let them go...
Come out...go back...
Please
Please sit...
lt's gold
l was just joking, l won't dare to take it
lt's delicate
After the meal, clean it up and
send the whole set to brother's He room
Yes
Please sit...
Make yourselves at home
Let's eat
l counted just now
the whole set consists of 56 pieces
no more no less
lt should be 120 pieces, you counted less
This could last us over ten years
My swords
Damn, my receipt is gone
Oh, Master Yuan wouldn't mind that
He is a true friend
l'll do whatever you ask of me
Thanks, l just want to be friends with you
and have no intention to ask for favours
You are so good to them
they just eat and practise kung fu
and make a mess of the place
why do you keep them?
There's also that set
with over a hundred gold pieces
They'll do anything for me
if l treat them well
As for gifts to them
let's just say
they are temporary in their keeping
They'll eventually be mine again
Guan Yun
When should we ask them to go?
Can't tell them to gojust like that
You ought to be with them more often
and let them know
how l've been ill-treated by Guan Yun
Let them dojustice for me
Yes
And you need to pretend to be the victim
Yes
You...
lt's alright
Chief Li, what happened to you?
Are you alright?
Don't ...
lndeed, should have
given some face to the master
Who beat you?
That's not important
but even
Master has had to suffer injustice
Who dares to do such a thing?
Not to mention that
Master is an expert in kung fu
his family is rich and famous too
Master values his fame too much
that he won't allow us to bully others
No use talking about virtue & morality
to guys like him
Nonsense
Stack it up, hurry ...
What is it?
lt's this guy
Do you know him?
Met him before, very harsh
People are afraid at the sight of you
Treacherous cur
One to one
Your kung fu is good
but can't compare with mine
Brother ...
l didn't fight
This guy is henpecked
No, she's his sister
His sister?
Mom told you not to cause trouble
Not afraid of sister but afraid of Mom
Don't tell mom
Considering you're a filial kid,
l'll allow you 3 moves
Do you have the ability to do so?
You have my word
lf you kill me in 3 moves
l've my incompetence to blame
Alright
He let you make 3 moves,
why use so much force?
You want to stall me
while you deal with my mother and sister
One killed, one less problem
We'd have advantage of outnumbering you
if we wanted
l'm not yet dead
l'll allow you 3 moves, too
Not bad
Brother
Ah Yun, are you fighting again?
Not at all, mom
They are my friends
We are practising kung fu, look
We are friends
Auntie, how are you?
Foolish kid,
ask your friends in
Ah Xiao, see if there is enough food
Cook a bit more and invite them for dinner
Mom, there's no need
They are quite well-fed,
see how plump they appear
We'll fight again tomorrow
Deal, where?
God of Chivalry Temple;
we won't leave until we meet
Let's go
Too bad
You allowed me 3 punches yesterday
l allowed you 3 kicks, you only made 2
Today l'll allow you one more kick
l can't win, l don't want to fight anymore
Say, even if you don't hope to win,
just keep fighting
That's exactly why l want to spar with you
l'm coming
Yang Zhui Feng,
who's side are you on anyway?
l am deeply focussed on
observing the best fung fu
but not you
What is your weapon of choice?
He Fei's swords are serious
Hear that?
So are my kicks and punches
Good swords
You know my stuff
l said good swords, not good swordsmanship
You'll find that out soon
No matter what
they'll have no effect on me
Oh, really!
Just look
Quite a good move!
We have no great quarrel with each other
and you are unarmed
l can't really kill you
The man who could hasn't been born yet
But that's it today
it'll be your turn tomorrow;
would you come?
Alright
Listen
Too bad we can't defeat Guan Yun
Guan Yun is quite a hero
Yang Zhui Feng, it's up to you now
Don't touch
lmmediate death?
lf you still want to fight
Forget it, you still look like a man
When you stop looking like a man,
l won't spare you
Nonsense
Let's get some late night supper
Still the same old habits
Save it for tomorrow
while l watch you at the duel
Bring it here
Please, eat and get more strength
l am not a dog of the Yuan family
Well said
That's more like abusing us!
Come, eat
l'm hungry, l'll rest for now
Come again in the afternoon, wait here
Could you have won,
had the fight continued?
Maybe, but to beat him
because he is hungry
that's not fair
He runs a security bureau
l don't think he'll go hungry
ln this day and age
what business could a bureau have?
Then what about your swords?
What do you have in mind?
Pawn it no matter how much it fetches, and
then get food and wine
to feast with Guan Yun
You're crazy
You...
Guan Yun is a good man,
we should drink with him
Yes, The Yuan family has food and wine
We can bring some
lt's got to be us treating him
No way
Alright...l'll do it myself
Let go
Come and have a drink with us
We paid for the food
out of our own pockets
please be our guest
Hey, l bought this by pawning my swords
if you don't come over l'll kill you
l haven't seen a guest invited this way
Alright, for the sake of your swords
Let's drink
Cheers
ln the morning we fought with
kicks and punches
let's see about your skills with the pole
You are still barehanded
That's right, l never use weapons
We've eaten, so let's fight
Come on, you two fight
Guan Yun and those 4 guys
seem to have become friends
l expected this to happen
Since those 4 guys are useless
why don't we...
Who says they are useless
Swap this stick with Yang Zhui Feng's
Go
lf they find out, l'll kill you
Yes...
don't worry
No winner yet
Your stick which you boast
could kill at a touch
is useless
Guan Yun is a good man;
competition is one thing
but one shouldn't injure others
His stick might not be able to
hurt Guan Yun
Let's see about it tomorrow
Guan Yun is a man to make friends with
That's more like it
Alright, l'll settle your score
on redeeming the swords
My treat today
How did you get the money?
You pawned something,
can't l also do the same?
Alright fellas, come and eat
Come on
lt seems your security bureau
hasn't had any business
You're so stubborn
if there's no business just sell it
Why...
Brother Guan, don't be angry
He Fei also had a security bureau;
Owing to
no business he sold it and now he's adrift
Useless
l would be frank and tell you
my family also ran a security bureau
just like He Fei
Since l am in such a sorry state
l haven't mentioned it to anyone
l never use weapons
and always fight with my bare hands
There was no winner yesterday
so you must use your stick to the utmost
Don't hold back because l am not armed
l have a few deadly techniques
l fear...
Don't worry, use them
if l'm dead l have only myself to blame
Alright
Come
Please
These are the deadly techniques?
No...
Oh, you've hidden explosives in your stick
no wonder you say it could kill at a touch
We are competing with kung fu, you...
No, l didn't know
Mother, sister, l can't...
Stop
Don't stop, Yang Zhui Feng,
you are a villain
Careful, his stick carries dynamite
''Wu Wei Security Bureau''
My brother said you four don't look like
Yuan's men
He was wrong
Miss Guan
Just kill me, don't think
Yuan is going to get me
With me here, he'll not get our property
Yuan Ying Fei has the money
to hire killers
Brother, how could l tell mother?
Miss Guan, we did not kill Guan Yun
We took him as a friend
Yuan Ying Fei must have hired
Yang Zhui Feng to kill
Child
Mother
Don't worry
Mother will go with you to a place
where Yuan will not be able to
bully you again
Master, you know magic?
What's this about?
When Guan Yun's abdomen blocked
the head of the stick
there was an explosion...
Not any magic
l made an identical stick
and stuffed it with dynamite
Of course, the impact would then
naturally be dynamic
Once you get rid of Guan Yun...
There's something else l need to see to
l'll take care of those fools
you go to tell miss Guan
l avenged her brother
and fetch her and her mom here
Yes
Where's he hiding?
Yuan Ying Fei, what do you want?
Avenge Guan Yun
We must be blind
l must go to the Guan family
Yang Zhui Feng, you...
Guan Yun's mother and sister...
You wouldn't even let a woman live
When l came, they were already...
Wait, where's Zeng Qiao and Feng Jia Ji?
Forget them
Listen, l will find out the truth
at which time
if you still think l am wrong
l'll let you kill me with no regrets
Mrs Guan, Miss Guan
Master Yuan has killed those kids
and avenged you
Don't hide in the house in sorrow
l have come to tell you good news
Master Yuan has asked me to fetch you both
Master Yuan is wealthy, powerful,
young and handsome
Such an ideal man
is hard to come by
lf you still don't come out
l'll have to come and get you
lt's not my fault, it's master's idea
to stuff explosives in the stick
Master asked me to switch
Yang Zhui Feng's stick
to kill Guan Yun
lt's you
And you
Do you think
Yuan Ying Fei would come here?
No, he'll surely go to
God of Chivalry Temple
He thinks we are afraid to come here
Yes, that's what he thinks
but l expected you'd be here
so l waited for you
You are the restaurant's cashier
So you recognise me
l am a follower of the old Master Yuan
and shouldn't reveal my master's secrets
But he is really a mad man
He loves kung fu
and kills for no reason;
Just seeking a chance to use his skills
Old master loves his son
and taught him everything;
he spoiled him too
Master is smart &
made accomplishments in his training
Presently however,
he has no place to use his kung fu
just like many martial artists
who find their skills useless nowadays
Master used his resources to lay traps
to lure and kill martial artists
The restaurant is one such trap
You must have figured that out
Old master made his name with
Golden Sword
and the 1st move was named
Golden Wheel Facing the Sun
Master has fully mastered his skill
There are 7 moves to this technique
and under each are 7, making a total of 49
The deadliest is
'Five Clouds Worship the Sun'
The 7 moves are
Clouds from the Nine Heavens,
Clouds beneath the Feet,
Clouds from the Eastern Sea,
Clouds Out of the Wind,
Clouds Open for the Sun,
Nine Rotations of the Sun
The Sun Shines on Everywhere
This is all l know
You are martial artists
so you might appreciate more
l can't bear to see
master kill more people
this is all l could do to help
What's the use of knowing a few terms?
Just think
what technique did Yuan Ying Fei use?
l remember
he used Clouds from the Nine Heavens
to kill Zeng Qiao
He used Clouds beneath the Feet
to kill Feng Jia Ji
Only these two moves?
That's right
The other techniques
don't match the terms
The two of us alone aren't his match
Since his bodyguards just died
he is left without protection
Then we could deal with him together
We only have tonight to practise
and take him by a surprise attack tomorrow
so he'll be at a loss as to what to do
Let's do it now, time is tight
Practise and thwart his 2 moves,
Clouds from the Nine Heavens
then Clouds beneath the Feet
According to what we are practising,
l think we could thwart
his 2 moves
But we aren't sure of his other 5 moves
Based on what we know
Yuan Ying Fei uses
a hard-style swordsmanship
That's correct, he makes big movements
we need to attack his weak spot
We need to surprise him
and don't let him be well prepared
Remember,
we are here to avenge our friends
and not to compete
We'll take turns to attack in pairs
and force him to use
Five Clouds Worship the Sun
then beat him together
l understand
Also, when l fought with Guan Yun
l reserved three deadly moves
Actually it's for the emergency
which would complement your move
Let's practise now
When l use the Tiger in Woods
throw the drum at me
Reverse stance level strike
Tiger in the Woods
Throw it over
Master, they are here
l searched for you but in vain
l guessed you might come here and you did
Come in and don't worry
Except for this sword,
there's no other danger
You know l couldn't find any assistance
and that's why you've come
You're here to avenge your friends
l haven't been able to
find my match so far
Let's hope you both turn out to be
better than others
l'll attack him,
you take care of the other two
in case they try any tricks
at the critical moment
Golden Wheel Facing the Sun
lt's Clouds from the Nine Heavens
Clouds Out of the Wind
Hmm, you seem to know
a lot about my techniques
For a change,
try this Clouds Open for the Sun
and then this Nine Rotations of the Sun
The Sun Shines on Everywhere
l needn't worry about
where to stay and eat tonight
How about you?
