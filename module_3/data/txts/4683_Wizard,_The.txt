<i>Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute.</i>
<i>I found him. I found him.</i>
<i>Putnam was right.</i>
<i>He's about three miles south</i>
<i>of the old Butte Road.</i>
I got it.
On my way.
Son. Son.
Yeah, it's him all right.
Whoa. Whoa, son.
Now just where do you
think you're going, boy?
California.
<i>Sure, kid.</i>
We all want to go to California.
My wife wants to go to California.
<i>Joe. Come in, Joe.</i>
<i>You just stay put.</i>
<i>Now what do you want me</i>
<i>to do with him?</i>
<i>Take him to his mother's place.</i>
<i>She's remarried.</i>
<i>Her name's Christine Bateman.</i>
<i>She lives on the south side of town.</i>
You got that?
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Okay, son, time to go.
Upsy-daisy.
Your mom's waiting
for you now.
<i>So, on these trips that he takes,</i>
has he tried to see Corey or Nick
or his natural father?
<i>Christine!</i>
Oh, I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Look, he just- he just
picks up his little lunch pail-
What is in that thing-
<i>and off he goes.</i>
I mean, he could go anywhere:
Downtown, the canyons,
the river.
He doesn't go to the river.
He never even goes near the river.
Okay.
He stays away from the river.
But I'm telling you anytime-
I mean, he could just pick up
and go.
The Happy Wanderer- at the stroke
of midnight, if he feels the urge,
in the middle of his Frosted Flakes.
I got the neighborhood
on red alert, and I'm putting
the cops on overtime.
<i>Mr. Bateman!</i>
Though Jimmy is
a heavily traumatized boy,
<i>he has a certain fixation</i>
<i>with building, stacking things.</i>
These little monuments he makes,
<i>I'd like to think that</i>
<i>they mean something.</i>
I'd like to think that he's searching
for a way to express himself.
But you don't.
<i>Look, we've been sending this boy</i>
<i>here for two years.</i>
I think it's time we started
exploring some, uh, alternatives.
<i>We're thinking about, uh,</i>
<i>putting him into an institution,</i>
<i>a home.</i>
Is that something original, Dad?
I'm tryin' to cook you guys
a decent meal.
You can't be livin' off
burgers and pizza.
It cannot possibly belong to
one of the four major food groups.
It's a casserole, genius.
Doesn't it look like a casserole?
We saw Jimmy yesterday, Dad.
Yeah?
So how is he?
They're talking about
putting him in a home.
That's Christine's decision.
She has custody now.
You know that.
Well, I'm, uh-
I'm not really too hungry.
I'll grab some a little later.
I wanna know about the pickup.
I found it this morning
covered with mud.
You took it again.
Just gimme a break, please.
- This has nothing to do with the pickup.
- It has everything to do with it!
- I wanna know why you disobey me
when I give you a direct order?
- Why do you do this?
They're gonna put him
in a home, Nick!
He hasn't changed ever since Jennifer.
Come on. Dad!
He doesn't do anything.
He doesn't say anything.
- What about it, man?
What about the rules around here?
- <i>Don't call me "man,"all right?</i>
- What? The pickup, the rules?
You always do this.
- <i> Corey, come on.</i>
No, Dad, will you listen to me?
What, you wanna see that happen?
You wanna see 'em
put Jimmy in a home?
<i>Corey</i>-
Fine, Dad.
Just because he's our half brother,
he doesn't matter, right?
Cor-
Enjoy your casserole.
<i>Corey?</i>
Leave me alone.
Why do you keep doin' this
to yourself? It's been two years.
Yeah, what do you care?
Why don't you and I just go
over to the Dairy Queen, huh?
We'll kick back a couple.
Come on, it's on me.
No.
You didn't even care about him
when you had the chance.
All you care about is yourself.
<i>What bothers me is that you</i>
<i>seem to have no respect for me...</i>
<i>or no appreciation</i>
<i>for living in this house!</i>
<i>What do you care about</i>
<i>what I do anyway?</i>
<i>Jimmy's in a home and you don't care.</i>
<i>If Mom was still here, she'd be</i>-
<i> Don't you tell me what</i>
<i>I care about, young man.</i>
<i>You don't care about us!</i>
<i> You steal my pickup</i>
<i>and now you're drinking,</i>
<i>and I don't like it!</i>
<i> A bunch?</i>
<i>I went out a few times.</i>
<i>Oh, you went out a few times.</i>
<i> You have no sense</i>
<i>of responsibility for this house!</i>
<i> I do.</i>
<i>For you to carry out</i>
<i>the trash is a big deal!</i>
South Dakota.
- <i> Wash my truck</i>
<i>every once in a while.</i>
- Arkansas.
Nebraska.
California.
Come on. Let's go.
...Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom.
Just as those caribou
were once in trouble,
<i>so now are the largest members</i>
<i>of the deer family.</i>
<i>... especially the calves during</i>
<i>the first few months oflife...</i>
when they're preyed upon by wolves
who roam this region in packs.
<i>The signal from the collar</i>
<i>is monitored daily.</i>
<i>If the calf stops moving</i>
<i>for two hours,</i>
a change becomes evident in the signal,
indicating death has occurred.
Jimmy.
Jimmy, we're gonna
do a little traveling-
just you and me.
<i>What do you think?</i>
- California?
- Yeah.
<i>Now we'll follow the calf to make certain</i>
<i>he gets back to his mother.</i>
<i>Yeah, California.</i>
Come on.
<i>They're together again.</i>
Do you like chocolate?
Yeah.
Good. Get in.
You understand, Mr. Woods,
we don't have the manpower
to be pursuin' runaways,
even if the one boy
is handicapped.
Hey, look, he's not handicapped.
Whatever he is.
<i>They were seen hopping a truck.</i>
Uh, can we get to the, uh-
the point here?
Woods, your son, Corey,
has taken Jimmy.
They're both my sons.
<i>Oh. Okay. Okay</i>-
For the record, your two sons,
one of whom I am legally
responsible for,
have decided to eat their way across-
I don't see why we're
standin' here talkin' about it.
Because you are
missing the point.
<i>I have an obligation to</i>
<i>the welfare of this child.</i>
<i>I have to see that he is</i>
<i>returned here for the kind</i>
<i>of treatment he needs.</i>
Now, granted, the police are looking.
We've hired someone
to find him-
<i>Mr. Putnam.</i>
<i>Mr. Putnam retrieves runaways...</i>
<i>professionally.</i>
<i>He's going to</i>
<i>bring back Jimmy.</i>
What about Corey?
Well, Corey, uh, <i>wants</i> to
run away, doesn't he?
I mean, even if we brought him back,
would it do any good?
You know, Bateman, I, uh-
I always knew that you were a jerk.
I just, until now, thought
it was guilt by association.
Pop.
What?
I want to go with you.
Forget it. You can get
a ride back with Bateman.
I don't think so.
Uh, Mr. Woods. Excuse me.
Just so you know,
I make my money
by bringin' kids in,
and I don't make it
if someone else brings the kid in first.
You catch my drift?
So let's not be getting
in my way, okay?
Have a nice day.
We better drop by the house,
pick up some clothes.
End of the line, Ben?
Yeah, it's my last stop.
Come on.
Do you have to make
such a pig out of yourself?
Come on.
Stay there.
Hey! Jimmy!
Hey, wait up!
How about that cupcake?
You got plenty ofTwinkies.
Personally, I'm a Ho Ho man myself.
How about you?
Okay. So, according to this...
we're in Goblin Valley.
<i>Great.</i>
I mean- I mean-
I mean, it couldn't be Happy Valley
or Wonderful Valley.
Goblin Valley.
Why not Ax Murderer's Valley? Hmm.
Great.
There's a bench outside.
The bus'll be here any minute.
Now stay here for a minute.
Well, go ahead. Play.
Two tickets to California, please.
<i>You got someplace specifiic in mind,</i>
<i>or would you just like</i>
<i>to be dumped at the border?</i>
Is Los Ángeles specific enough?
<i>That's $226.</i>
Well, we only have $27.30.
Where does that get us?
Nowhere. It's $34
just to Saint George, Utah.
That's it?
Hey, Scotty, some of
those high school kids are up on the ridge
throwin' rocks at the highway again.
<i>Chase 'em on home,</i>
<i>will you? Over.</i>
50,000?
You got 50,000 on Double Dragon?
Hey, Chester.
Hi, Mike.
<i> Here's Mrs. Johnson's</i>
<i>complaints this month.</i>
<i> Not again.</i>
<i>How'd you do it?</i>
<i>You only played for five minutes.</i>
<i>How the hell did you get 50,000</i>
<i>on Double Dragon?</i>
<i>I never got 50,000 on Double Dragon.</i>
<i>How'd you do it?</i>
Hi. I'm Haley.
If you don't tell me
what you're doing,
I'm gonna scream.
- Uh, could you scream quietly?
- What, do you think I'm stupid?
<i>I saw you look at that cop.</i>
What's his problem?
<i>He's just... shy.</i>
Shy a few bricks I'd say.
<i>No, he's okay.</i>
He just kicked ass
on Double Dragon.
Get out of here. Him?
Yeah. He could wax your tail.
<i>No way.</i>
- Wanna bet?
- How much?
$6.70.
I don't have $6.70.
Well, that's okay, 'cause, uh,
you got a bus ticket.
You could cash it in.
Let's see him beat that.
Come on, Jimmy.
What is he, some kind
of freak or somethin'?
That's it.
Hey!
Two tickets to Saint George.
You conned me.
I didn't. I won the bet.
Give me that money.
Great! Great.
Now I'm stuck here.
Hey. Hey.
Where the hell are we?
What is that, doughnuts?
Yeah. So?
It's disgusting.
From the guy who steals my pickup
and stays up drinkin',
the guy with the foul mouth,
that's a compliment.
Where are we?
We're supposed to be headin' west.
That's the direction
the cupcake truck went.
We're headin' west.
Wait a second.
We're not headin' west.
We're headin' south.
What the hell have you been doing?
I've been drivin'
the whole damn night.
I must have stopped 50 times
and asked about where those kids are.
Come on.
Oh, Jesus.
We're on the other side
of the canyons, man. Turn around.
Gimme that thing.
Pop! Pop!
Get over!
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?
<i>Look at him. He's making thejump,</i>
<i>it's his second time through...</i>
<i>and he hasn't even</i>
<i>taken a hit yet.</i>
- He's a wizard.
- So he can play Ninja Gaiden?
So what?
So I got an idea.
If he can beat me,
why can't he beat
any old video head?
We could pick up
some loose change.
Are you kidding me? That's warped.
The kid's a natural.
A genius. A pro.
He picks it up like lint.
Why do you want to
haul him off to California?
California.
I got it.
You want to go to California,
and you want to prove that Jimmy
doesn't belong in a home.
Do you think they'd put him
in a home after he'd won this?
<i>A video game contest?</i>
Haley, he's-
<i>He's what?</i>
Too crazy?
Too stupid?
He's sure not the genius you are-
trying to get to California on 27 bucks.
<i>You don't believe</i>
<i>in him yourself.</i>
What does this matter to you anyway?
<i>It's a business deal.</i>
If I can get you to California
and he wins, we split the money.
Do you think I'd hang around
a pair like you for my health?
Hey, sweetheart,
I'm lookin' for some kids.
- Pop, I'm starving!
- We'll get 'em in the next town.
- Hey!
- Now I warned you! This is my living!
Didn't I tell you this was my living, huh?
Son of a bitch.
- Oh, Jesus!
- All right. All right,
there's no cause to get crazy.
It's very hot.
- This is a professional matter.
- Yeah!
I don't appreciate this, Woods!
You got no class! No class at all!
So, uh, now that we're here,
you want to go grab a bite
to eat or what?
<i>We gotta plan a strategy.</i>
Lucky for you I know this highway
like the back of my hands.
My dad's a trucker.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. He makes a weekly run
between Reno and Kansas City.
<i>That's where I live</i>- <i>Reno.</i>
<i>You gotta be very adult to live in Reno.</i>
<i>It's the world's "biggest little city."</i>
Haley, are you sure
about these guys?
<i>Oh, don't you worry about them.</i>
<i>I'm telling you, I know truckers.</i>
They got a code.
A code?
<i>My dad sent me home early.</i>
<i>He likes me to watch the house.</i>
<i>We got a really, really nice house.</i>
<i>Yeah?</i>
Where's your mom?
She packed it in.
She was a showgirl.
Great legs.
I got her legs.
What do you think?
Okay, we gotta pool our money.
What do you got left?
Um,
<i>$21.</i>
I got 87 from the bus ticket.
Oh, is this Reno?
No, stupid.
Well, you said it was
the world's "biggest little city."
I thought maybe I missed it.
What are you doing? Let go of-
Corey, take the money!
Haley!
Hang onto her, Larry!
Jimmy, stay there!
Stay there, Jimmy!
Look out, kid.
Listen, kid,
all we want is the cash.
Ugh. Hey, stay away from me!
You smell like sh-
I'll get-
Hey! Hey, this is our money!
Hey, this is our money!
It's our money! Hey! Hey!
I got it! I got it!
Well, that's some code they got.
<i>You don't have my size.</i>
<i>I don't care what brand it is,</i>
<i>just somethin'to get me goin'.</i>
In your size, with your price,
all I got is these retreads,
which would be old whitewalls.
Whitewalls?
What the hell is that?
Oh, it's Corey's old video game.
I found it in the back
of the pickup truck.
I thought the old one was broken?
It was. I fixed it.
You fixed it?
And you just hook it up?
You don't ask?
It's not like I'm cuttin' tags
off of mattresses, Pop.
It's just a video game.
You oughta know.
You bought it for him.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Where are we?
Does it matter?
We're broke.
Oh, yeah, you're tellin' me!
You're the one with all the trucker friends-
the one who knows all the codes.
I got you this far, didn't I?
Oh, I don't even know
where "this" is!
A lot of faith you got.
Oh, will you stop, Haley?
I mean, we don't have any money.
Aren't you just a little scared?
I don't get scared!
Now give me the four bucks
you're holding out on.
What?
<i>You flashed 21,</i>
you stashed four
from the change at lunch.
They didn't get it 'cause
you put it in your shorts.
Now dish it up!
You're gettin' awful personal,
you know.
What are you doing?
We've gotta find someone
dumb enough to sucker.
And seeing how it's too warped
for you, I guess it's up to me.
Wait a minute.
That's my four dollars.
All right, now pay attention.
You might learn something here.
Hey, I could beat you
the way you're goin' now.
Oh, there you go.
Perfect. They're salesmen.
Wait here.
That's great.
That's looking great.
That's far out. Great.
<i>That was a good one.</i>
<i>Good shot. Good. Good.</i>
Not bad. Not bad.
<i>Thanks.</i>
- You got some skill.
- Some? What do you mean some?
Oh, myself? No.
Not a challenge.
Now my brother over here,
now he could beat you.
<i>Oh, go on.</i>
You're a monster, Jimmy.
You snaked 'em.
Didn't he snake 'em?
Look at him.
He's smiling.
You like this,
Jimmy, don't you?
Yeah, we're on our way, Jimmy boy.
We're on our way.
Geez, it's gonna be night.
I got an idea.
What?
Follow me.
What?
You'll see.
<i>I've spent plenty of nights</i>
<i>with my dad in these things.</i>
<i> What, did you travel</i>
<i>all over with your dad?</i>
If I want.
He takes me across country
in summer when school's out.
But sometimes he sends me
back early 'cause-
'cause he don't want
my whole life to be
on the road, you know?
Yeah, well, don't you
have any friends?
I got tons of friends.
I got so many friends
I don't have room for any more.
Sure.
Well, don't you ever get, uh,
scared traveling all by yourself?
I told you.
I don't get scared.
Never?
Okay, we have $47.12,
which I think
we can double, maybe triple,
by the time we get to Reno.
Now, look. I got these <i>Power</i>
magazines to help Jimmy,
so we can teach him
the secret tricks in each game.
Hi.
<i>470,000 and climbing</i>
<i>on F1 Dream.</i>
What is this kid,
some kinda cyborg?
Sorry, wartface, but, uh,
first you play, then you pay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Who you callin' wartface,
weenie, huh?
<i>Hey, hey!</i>
<i>What's goin'on over there?</i>
<i>The three of you, huh?</i>
What'd I tell you about
roughhousin' in here?
I gotta spell it out!
Roger!
Roger, it's them again!
I got video monsters.
I got movie monsters.
<i>I got graffiiti-on-the-wall monsters!</i>
<i>I hate this place!</i>
- He's good,
but he'd never beat Lucas.
- Lucas?
Nobody's better than Lucas.
Lucas is awesome.
Oh, really? And, uh,
where might we find this Lucas?
So, you the wizard?
No, he is.
This guy?
I don't get it.
Is he, like, a poster child for someone?
For your information, butt-head,
he's headed for
the video championships
in Los Ángeles.
Oh. Is that right?
Well, let's just see
how good he is. Guys?
<i>Pick any game you want.</i>
I'm good at all of them.
I have <i>9</i>7 of them.
You know all <i>9</i>7 of them?
What is that?
I don't know.
The Power Glove.
Geez.
I love the Power Glove.
It's so bad.
Yeah, well, uh,
just keep your power gloves
off her, pal, huh?
Go ahead, Jimmy,
show 'em what you got.
<i>Go ahead.</i>
Hey- Hey, Jimmy!
By the way, I'm headed
to the championships too.
<i> Sunny skies will continue over</i>
<i>the Great Basin today and tomorrow.</i>
<i>Fair skies through tonight.</i>
Hey.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, come on.
I want to get an early start
in the morning.
I know that this is, um,
not a good thing.
Hmm? What's that?
Corey and Jimmy
runnin' off, but, uh...
I just want to let you know that...
I'm glad that I'm here.
Mm-hmm.
You remember all those trips
we used to take every year?
Go to the ocean.
California.
<i>That was great.</i>
<i>We'd stop at every cornball</i>
<i>tourist trap along the way.</i>
Yeah. That's the best
I remember us all.
Yeah.
Jennifer was a kick, huh?
She and Jimmy together,
they'd both go nuts.
I'm tired, Nick.
It's late.
What the hell am I doin' here?
I'm sleepin' with my father
in some dump on the highway.
Hell, you don't want me here.
- Jesus! We can't even
talk to each other!
- You're in your underwear!
I can't believe it!
I cannot even speak
to my own father!
Mr. Cheapskate, he gets us a room
that does not even have double beds.
Ah, come on.
I gotta get some sleep.
So sleep.
You really play this thing, huh?
That's right.
What's that one called?
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
...okay, Robot?
I feel fine, Will Robinson.
Doesn't take much intelligence
to play that game, does it?
You should know.
<i>Oh! Oh, shit!</i>
What the hell are you doin'?
I don't believe this.
I got the scroll weapon,
and I almost beat Mecha Turtle
at the end of level three.
You got the scroll weapon?
Yeah.
He's losing his mind.
<i>Come on, come on.</i>
Jimmy?
<i>What's wrong?</i>
Jimmy?
Jimmy.
No, Jimmy.
What's the matter?
I- I-I don't know.
He- He builds these things.
It means he hasn't gotten better.
Listen, Jimmy, you lost yesterday.
That was one loss. One guy.
Will you listen to me?
See, this is what
he does all day. Nothing.
Dang, we've come all this way.
Jimmy.
Jimmy.
<i>That wasn't nothing.</i>
It's me, Corey.
That's what it is.
He's jealous.
Jealous?
Over you?
Geez, Corey, you're so thick!
You're all he's got.
Don't you understand that?
Aw, you're crazy.
He doesn't even figure that way.
And what if he does?
And what if you do?
Do what?
You know what.
It ain't like I need you weasels,
you know? And you don't have to
be acting like you need me.
- What's the matter with you?
- Yesterday... with Lucas-
like I was somethin' special to you.
- Look, Haley, all I said-
- I told you, this is a business deal.
I'm not gonna be responsible
for making him more of a basket case!
It's them.
The guys from the arcade.
Corey, we gotta get out of here.
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Jimmy.
Come on.
No, Jimmy!
Come on, Jimmy!
Come on!
Hey, boy! Hey! Hey!
Hey, you little jerk!
You took us for 20 bucks last night.
- Yeah, what of it?
- You didn't tell us this mutant
was some kind of pro.
Pro? My grandmother
could have taken you.
- Let's just dish it up,
all right, smart-ass?
- Hey, it was a fair bet.
- Let's see what
the little mutant's got.
Hey, leave him alone!
Give it back to him!
What the hell is this?
- Corey, give them the money.
- Yeah.
This is for interest, dork.
You go ahead.
You have yourself a nice day.
Thanks, kids.
Thanks for the hat, moron!
Jennifer.
What are they?
I always wondered
what he had in that thing.
It was her.
She was his twin sister.
They got down by the river,
Jimmy and her, and somehow
Jennifer got too close.
Jimmy couldn't swim,
so he was afraid.
It was weird,
'cause-
'cause she didn't go downstream at all.
She just died...
in a few feet of water
right in front of him.
It was really hard for Jimmy...
and for Nick.
Who's Nick?
My brother.
He was supposed to be
watching them for Christine.
Nick and Christine
didn't get along too well.
<i>Because Christine</i>
<i>was my dad's second wife,</i>
<i>Jimmy and Jennifer,</i>
we were their half brothers,
but Christine didn't really
see it that way.
<i>After Jennifer died, well...</i>
everything just fell apart.
<i>Where are you going?</i>
Where are you going?
I'm gonna go find a telephone
and call my dad.
You're quitting?
You can't quit. Not now.
Look, the contest is in three days,
and he hasn't even learned
half the games Lucas has.
I mean, look at him.
It's over, Haley.
You're a quitter, Corey.
And I don't care if you did like me.
Your attitude sucks.
- You wanted me to like you?
- Not anymore.
Great.
Corey, I don't wanna quit.
<i>Jimmy!</i>
<i>Jimmy!</i>
<i>You want to play?</i>
He wants to play!
We're not quitting here, okay?
All right, I'm looking
for a couple of kids.
This one's a mental case.
Have you seen 'em?
Does he dress like you?
No.
Well, then he couldn't be
too much of a case, all right?
That's very funny.
All right, now listen up, fruit fly.
It's time to get real.
Two kids-
one is nine, one is 13,
there's a girl with 'em...
and they've been
hangin' out in arcades-
have you seen them?
I wouldn't tell you if I knew.
Where the hell are we?
That son of a bitch!
Oh, geez!
What the hell are you doing? God!
- Sorry about that.
- Woods! You maniac!
I'm gonna sue! Do you hear me?
I'm gonna sue your ass when this is over!
You make money off little kids,
you miserable jerk!
You oughta be shot!
What are you doin'?
Do you want some more, huh?
I don't think he does.
He's had plenty.
Son of a bitch!
I told you to stay
out of my way, Woods!
You chickenshit!
Ah, hell.
Corey.
So this is where you live.
It's got some charm,
you think?
<i>Okay. We got three days</i>
<i>to get him good at every game</i>
<i>they could possibly throw at him.</i>
- Are you kidding me? I mean, there
must be 70 games he's never played.
- Trust me.
Now look.
This is gonna take a lot of quarters.
<i>I gotta find someone</i>-
<i>a friend of my dad's.</i>
<i>He's a trucker. His name is Spanky.</i>
The pass line!
<i>Spanky, the pass line!</i>
<i>The pass line!</i>
Pay 12. Pass 12.
Five on the pass line.
<i>It's coming out again.</i>
<i>Do or don't pass.</i>
Oh, craps 12!
- Once more! Once more!
- On the pass line.
Winner! Seven!
Put it on the field!
Put it on the field!
On the field.

Oh, and, Spank,

Ten bucks?
Thanks.
Okay, level seven?
Let me get my book.
<i>Hi. This is Karen</i>
<i>with Nintendo Game Play Counsel.</i>
We have new games.
<i>All you gotta do is wait</i>
<i>until the thing lights up. Uh-huh.</i>
Here you go.
Updates.
Nintendo Game Playing, this is Rick.
How can I help you?
Hi. My name is Haley, and I've got
a wizard who's going all the way
to the championships in Los Ángeles.
Is that so?
All I need is a little help.
Okay, let's start with Simon's Quest.
Okay, now where exactly
are you in the game?
<i>Miss Laurie Stevenson.</i>
<i>Candy bars, bubble gum, licorice.</i>
Hey, babe.
No. Mrs. Bateman,
as soon as I know where they are,
you'll be the first to know.
Y- You- Mrs. Bateman,
you forgot to tell me
that your ex-husband is a maniac.
You know, children are one thing,
but with maniacs, I get more.
No, they're crisscrossin'
around the state. They-
They're playin' video games.
No, I-Yeah, I don't-
Oh, shit!
Good, you see?
The best food at the airport.
They'd never come to a place like this.
What the hell's wrong
with this place?
No- Mrs. Bateman,
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Hey.
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>
You wanna make a quick 50?
If you have to, we'll get it to go.
I don't wanna get that to go.
Hi. Eggs, soda,
with some fries, please, medium.
To go.
No, no. Not to go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We're sitting here.
Uh, excuse me.
<i>I'm lookin'for two kids: One about this tall,</i>
<i>the other one about here.</i>
A hat.
<i>Mister, we got 'em in all sizes.</i>
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Mind if I ask you
where you got that hat?
Yeah, I mind.
I got it from a moron.
What's that?
Nice hat.
Where'd you get that hat, huh?
Couple of kids.
<i>They owe me some cash.</i>
Uh-huh.
Where'd they go?
Who knows?
<i>Hey! I'll tell you</i>
<i>where they were goin'.</i>
Where?
Los Ángeles!
What kind of a crazy idea
has that kid got?
We're 500 miles
from Los Ángeles.
Uh, Pop?
I'm gonna go have a seat.
Shit.
Haley.
Ah. Okay-
Here you go, Jim.
Counting Rampage
and Doctor Chaos,
we have 72 out of <i>9</i>7-
three of which he's had a little trouble with-
Ha.
So we have, uh, 28 more to go.
In one day?
Those look really bad, Corey.
They look really bad.
How do these look bad?
<i>These are classic.</i>
Because we don't need any of that stuff.
<i>Yes, we do.</i>
Now look. Look at this.
Look at this.
What? Ajacket?
Look at this jacket.
Look at the desig-
We got plenty of clothes.
We need entertainment.
<i>We need toys, entertainment, like</i>-
<i>Look. These are perfect entertainment.</i>
<i>Look what I got for him. Peek-a-boo Peepers.</i>
<i>Look, they're weighted,</i>
<i>so they can put them in their-in your soup,</i>
<i>or, like, you know, your friend's soup.</i>
You can do everything with these things.
They're-What do you thi-
Jimmy, you're such a dork.
Look, Mrs. Bateman,
I got it from this snot named Lucas.
They're headed for this big
video championship in Los Ángeles. It-
No! Don't meet me there.
I'll have 'em before you ever get there.
Mrs. Bateman? Mrs. Bateman!
The guy said, "Take it," so I took it.
How was I supposed to know?
I mean, it looked like a wreck.
Unfortunately,
they started stripping it.
Hey, buddy, you seen these kids?
Hey, buddy-
<i>Hey, we're tryin'</i>
<i>to play craps here.</i>
Oh, forget it.
<i>Six! Six!</i>
<i>Paging Melba Jean Hokin.</i>
<i>Melba Jean Hokin</i>
<i>to the white courtesy phone, please.</i>
Excuse me, miss.
I'm looking for a couple of kids-
this one right here in particular.
Have you seen him?
I know they're around here.
No.
No?
No.
Uh, yeah, I'd like a light-
Hey!
I got him! I got him!
Where is he?
Where's who?
Don't give me any lip, you snot!
I've been followin' you
across two states.
I'm bein' paid to bring
your little brainless brother back.
Now point him out!
<i>Mister, you'll find your other son</i>
<i>in the arcade.</i>
I hate you!
Haley!
Oop!
Got you, Jimmy boy.
Time to go home, son.
We're too late.
He touched my breast!
<i>What the hell are you doin'?</i>
No. I-
Put the kid down.
No. I- I didn't touch anything!
You can't-
You can't have the kid.
The kid is-What are you-
<i>I got a letter of custody for that kid</i>
<i>right here in my pocket!</i>
What are you doing?
Put me down!
<i>Paging Mr. Johnny Love.</i>
<i>Mr. Johnny Love</i>
<i>to the white courtesy telephone, please.</i>
Jimmy, are you okay? Are you okay?
Come on. We can't stay here.
Where the hell are we, Haley?
My home.
Your home?
Nice place.
Hey, Pop, I think we got it.
Wait a second.
I'm in the sixth palace of Hyrule.
Oop. Yeah!
I got past the River Devil.
Terrific.
What the hell are you doin'?
I had the magic key. I got the cross.
I was closin' in on the Barbarian!
You're losin' it, Pop.
Let's get in the car, huh?
Jimmy's out cold
in the house.
So you always, uh,
sit up here on the roof?
It's better than being inside.
Look. I know how I told you
I lived in some great place,
so don't be rubbing it in.
- I didn't say anything.
- It ain't my fault.
<i>And it ain't my dad's.</i>
My mom-
she had this little problem.
That's how I learned about craps.
I thought, maybe when...
my- my dad got home
tomorrow night from work,
we'd have won.
<i>Call him up from L.A. and say,</i>
<i>"Dad, guess what?</i>
We can buy a house now."
Geez, listen to me.
I even sound like a dork.
Zelda.
Zelda?
Yeah. Yeah, you know, it's like-
it's like the Adventures of Link.
He has to find Zelda,
you have to find a house-
same difference.
Boy, is that sexist.
It's not sexist.
It's romantic.
I know what you were gonna do,
and you can just forget about it.
There is no way!
I am <i>not</i> kissing a boy.
A girl maybe?
You smart-ass.
Yeah, Information.
I'm lookin' for a... Brooks, Reno.
B- R, double "O," K-S.
I touched her breast.
She doesn't <i>have</i> any breasts.
No, it's a Haley Brooks.
All right. Just give me all three.
All right. Yeah, look.
What I really need here
is an address. Okay.
Jimmy, time to get up.
Jimmy-
<i>Jimmy?</i>
<i>Corey!</i>
No.
Haley!
What?
Come on.
Jimmy! Stop!
<i>Wait!</i>
<i>Stop! Jimmy!</i>
Jimmy! Hey!
Wait!
Jimmy!
He's gone.
He's gone. It's over!
Just tell me the truth, Corey.
Did he really have a chance?
Yeah. No, I-
I don't know.
Look. I've never seen
anyone better, not even-
Not even Lucas?
Yeah. Not even Lucas.
Hey, where you goin'?
You think I don't have friends?
I got friends.
Friends? Haley!
<i>Hey. Hey!</i>
Hey! Sit down and shut up.
<i>You just made me some money,</i>
<i>space case.</i>
Here, have a sucker.
Look. Look, kid, you just do
like your Uncle Putnam tells ya,
or else it's gonna be a very long ride home.
What the hell is that?
Hey! What the hell are you doin'?
You're blockin' the road, guys.
All right. I want all
of your driver's license numbers!
Everyone of ya.
I want your driver's license numbers!
So you touched her breasts, huh?
Oh, my God.
<i>All right. All right. Let's not</i>

Come on, Spanky.
Faster, faster!
I'm already in a world of trouble

- All right, look. I'm glad you're here.
I'm glad you made it.
He's here. Believe me.
Where?
With all due respect, Mr. Bateman,
I've had a bitch of a time-
excuse my language-
and I'd rather not have
anything else go wrong.
I mean, it's so unfair.
How can they give us a new game?
A new game.
Hey, Lucas, man, that was great.
You're gonna rip their gizzards out, man.

Where'd he go?
Wait a minute.
Jimmy?
Jimmy.

Jennifer.
What-What is this?
What's going on?
It's all of us.
It was taken here.
Jimmy-
Jimmy, is this California?
I guess, he just wanted to leave her
in a place where she was happy.
I guess he wanted
to say good-bye.
Jim?
Why don't you take our boys home, Sam?
We'll talk when we get back to town.
Come on.
Let's go.
