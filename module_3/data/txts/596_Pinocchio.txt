Where have you been
for so long as?
I've been looking all over for you.
Anna, who bought me Bacon
and fresh bread.
When I fixed the hand,
I Fry's bacon.
We dunk the bread
into the hot fat.
It tastes good. You'll see.
I got so hungry.
Yes, a little patience
you will need to have.
I'm hungry but now!
You need hands to dinner.
- Papa?
- Yes?
Why your neck is black?
Oh, it's the chain.
That... that is made of copper
and makes a mark on the skin.
HO.
So, done.
And you now want to tell me
how that happened?
- Na, there was Lucignolo.
- Lucignolo?
Yes. This was about his idea?
No.
Yes, and what was it like?
I... stumbled.
Stumbled?
In the fire of Lucignolo.
Yes, and why are you stumbled?
Due to the colorful bird.
What a bird?
Was so flown.
Very fast as lightning.
And he had large wings veeery
coloured feathers and so.
They were as big
as the roof of a House.
And then I looked up
there and then I stumbled upon
in the fire of Lucignolo.
Could it be that you've
thought about?
No!
Lies have short legs
and long noses!
Then we will need to cut
comfortable here outside that.
No! No! UM...
- maybe a little bit made
- and what was it like?
I'm not stumbling.
And the bird was not huge.
Or stained.
Actually he hasn't been here.
Lucignolo told me
that I should keep
the hand in the fire.
Ah, so...
Are you now evil?
So as the Daddy
of Luca and Sofia?
No, I'm not mad.
Ah Pinocchio,
you can help me please and cut
the cane back
into smaller pieces?
No time.
Uh, why no time?
What are you doing?
I... I have to go to school.
As Luca... and Sofia.
Na... but yet again
tomorrow is school?
Then, tomorrow I'm.
Then you can help
now with the baskets.
- No, now is but not.
- Why not?
No desire.
- Buona sera.
- Geppetto.
If you want to again tighten
your wooden toy with me
I need a primer.
- A school primer?
- Yes.
You want what your age
with a school primer?
For my small...
to go to school.,
makes four ducats.
Gunge, gunge...
For this I give you primer.
Never!
If I give you my jacket...?
So good.
But just because
I'm a good person.
What is that?
It's writing.
- And what is there?
- Yes...
uh... What is there? So.
There is a forest and a big bear.
Two dogs chase him.
One bites the bear...
says it all?
Ah... You can read well.
Ja..
When I go to school, then
I'm no wood head, or?
- No.
- If I'm not a wooden head
- can I bleed?
- Bleeding-no, you can't.
Because you're from pine wood
and not a real person.
So Pinocchio, come on.
What is? "A real man"?
A real man, Yes...?
A real man has a heart.
And if you have a heart, then...
- Yes...?
- Yes, then...
- you feel so Stuff.
- Which is it for things?
Well, for example... Love.
- And love is sad?
- Only to lose them.
But she's the most beautiful
thing there is.
Why?
Because it's nice
to make the one you love.
And if it's good,
then I'm okay also.
And if it's bad,
it's tearing me heart.
- Then everything hurts me.
- Oooh... So like a sore Shin?
Mint worse.,
- I'm just fine!
- Mir also.
- Oh, that's nice.
- Ja...
Can I have this?
I Francesca gave
the amulet to the wedding.
Francesca was my wife.
But now you have to sleep.
Buona notte, Pinocchio.
Pulcino!
Hey!
Buon giorno, Pinocchio.
Already on his feet?
Unfortunately.
I did a little bit warm it.
That is... it was my tool!
You're not happy?
No... It was very
stupid of you!
You... Wooden head!
Buon giorno, Anna.
Come sit?
Buon giorno, Pinocchio.
- Pinocchio?
- Ciao Luca.
You're going now to the school?
Yes. And ne I fibula

sacrificed his jacket.
- I can't!
- Ah incomprehensible.

Two ducats.
Ja... Then go in time.
Done so I guess

- Why not?
- It so hard I to the poor!
- From the poor?
- Yes. I must not hard wear.
Well, and also I don't want
to pull such a heavy carts.
Now, if you really

a thick slice of "tired" cut off.
But watch out that
you get a tummy ache from
you naughty boy!
You're not hard wear?
- What is it hell for a brazen lie?
- I know
this woman

And she would have cooked
a whole meal for friends.
Yes, the cart looked so hard.

To let go!
What is it?
Pulcino, let the rabbit at rest.

After there!
With the gold!
Come on,

Come, come,

Now it belongs to us, the gold.
- Here with the gold, I told!
- Come...

who will help you.
What is that?
Now is better...
Now, he's gone maledetto!
Santo cielo, who may have
not dissolved but in air?
Popochipipo or your name!
You can reckon on what!
- I turn the throat if I get you!
- So not is called the.
I cut an ear or...
Is clear the air?
Oh...
- What was that for a blue light?
- I don't know
has saved us from these crooks.
Here we are at least safe.
But I have to continue.
Please not...
not again in the forest.
Please let us stay here.
But I don't want to stay here.
We... we... we vote.
Who is to remain here?
I want to go home.,
But you've got no majority.
With friends you can not even
robbing this Picipeco kid.
You're too stupid
to keep a knife...
You are easy
to use for anything!
But boy, what are you doing
here alone on the road?
This is quite dangerous.
I know.
There were robbers.
You tried to steal
my gold coins for me.
This is terrible...
I know this voice.
But as I see,
did you escape them.
And hopefully,
you haven't lost your gold, huh?
These are not...?
HO, the robbers just now!
I need quite quickly
away from here.
Home to Dad.
And I buy a new jacket
very much cakes
and tool of the gold coins.
And a school primer.
And a bone.
- A bone?
- AHA, for Pulcino.
- Pulcino?
- Pulcino?
- And who is Coco?
- Coco? Na my cricket.
- I, I, I, I.
- Ah, your grille.
Yes, its grille.,
For five gold coins
you don't get everything but.
- Not?
- Not?,
then am I so not rich?
I'd say, yet not at the moment.
But you're lucky. Here all is close
to the field of miracles.
There's always the sun shines.
If you bury today
still your five gold coins
a tree which hang from
hundreds gold coins
is growing there at sunrise.
- Really?
- Really?
Of course.
Then you're really rich and friends
can fulfill your every desire.
- Each?
- Each.
Auch, that ne I wound,
if I get knocked down?
The field of miracles to satisfy.
- Because I want to go!
- That way.
Pinocchio,
now would be an ideal time
to prove that you're not
a wooden head!
This fake snake tried this morning
and just in the forest
to steal your gold coins.
In the forest?
They were however predator.
With whom does he speak
there all the time?
And which were
also quite different.
Na, all paletti?
Are you my friends, isn't it?
Of course! Let's go.
Real?
Not that there yet...
- Is still lower?
- No. That's enough.
So, now the coins inside.
Pinocchio, I'm warning you.
You can't trust them.
Well you do time? Come on!
Are you sure that this really
works with the coin tree?
If it says as a tree grows,
then as a tree grows!
So, now with the coins!
One... two... three...
four... five...
so.
Now well knock.
This is quite important for the roots.
What you know...
and now need
the coins of course quiet
otherwise they can not grow.
And if they are disturbed it,
then is there not a tree out of it.
That's it makes sense, or?
- And when the tree is grown?
- Na at sunrise.
So, and now comes.
Come on, Pinocchio!
Come on, do not cheat.
I'm.
- It is not.
- Oh man, it must go.
Ah, the Sun is risen.
Oh, no!
No.
I told you so.
They were thieves!
But you wouldn't listen
to me Yes.
- Let me.
- No, you think rather these crooks
because you never think
about anything.
- Although I always tell you.
- Because you annoy.
Oh, I'm being annoying?
You're still the biggest pain ever.
I'm a cricket world, Yes.
Known for style and taste.
Instead I schlittere
here with friends
by a disaster in the other!
- I thought are my friends.
- And that is the problem.
- Either you don't think or...
- or what?
You think.
And that's even worse.
Why?
Because in your head
is just wood and no brains.
- Stop!
- Listen to!,
- Buon giorno, scusi tanto.
- Buon giorno.
I'm looking
for this puppet master.
If you think the puppet
master Mangiafuoco
is away just now.,
- With the ship to Spain.
- A ship for Spain?
You must stop.
My boy is on the ship.
Now, he goes first to the Bay.
If you hurry,
you can get the ship.
With this boat,
you the fastest progress.
Grazie.
Momento!
If you want the boat,
you have to pay for it.
Yes, I want it Yes do not buy.
I only want to borrow it.
I bring it back yet.
Cost hire.
Belongings but understanding
of a father looking for his son.
I did of.
But you have sympathy
for my business.
Is all I've got.
- That is sheet metal.
- No, which the chain is copper...
but... the trailer is gold.
- Gold?
- Gold plated.
Okay.
- Grazie...
- Yes, Yes...
He is probably old enough
to know what he's doing.
You want to do without
me go further?
Coco?
I don't know whether
it is a good idea
- to have even a Word with you?
- Apology.
Please.
Can we now please
stop with this tour?
- I want only to Daddy.
- Seriously? We go home again?
Promised!
Yikes! So for me
you don't have to run.
That's it...?
Shish...
- Sofia?
- Pinocchio!
- Luca! Sofia!
- Pinocchio!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my way home.
- Come better with us.
- Come Yes, Wonderland with US!
There's no school
and you can play all day.
- Carousel ride...
- no parents.
Even no adults who beat up one.
There's and all the candy
you can imagine, there.
- Tasty.
- Continue it now?
- Oh, you're also doing?
- Yes, of course.
Do you think I rot in a coffee
from a small town
and wait for the gold
of the trees grow?
Come on.
I go home.,
a wise decision, Pinocchio.
I'm really proud of you.
Schade.
It would have made probably
a lot more fun with friends.
A real boy can Wonderland
really not to be missed.
I come with!
- Yes, come on in...
- makes the door to. Yes...
- you can proceed.
- Yes. We're in the land of wonders.
I'm also a lollipop.
Your graceful appearance would
perfect by the amulet
which was already the Marchioness
of Turin at her wedding.
Uh, fits not.,
does nothing. Precious gold.
For a noble neck.
Gold? It even smells like gold?
- Gold does not stink.
- Yes, of course not.
You understand that
it is worth a small fortune.
You'd think it was copper.
But it is red gold.
So that's all I have left.
Is this enough?
But only because this amulet
