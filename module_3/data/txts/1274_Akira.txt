You're listening to
'Raat Baaki Baat Baaki'...

But we're still continuing to play...
...your requests.
This is Karan Singh, and
...on Tejal's request,
here's this super-hit song..
...from the film 'Tezaab'
Even you can send in your requests...
...but to do that, you must call.
So...do call.
"The world is asleep.
The sky is calm."
"Beckoning
destinations have gone quiet."
"The path is all deserted."
"The world is asleep.
The sky is calm."
"Beckoning
destinations have gone quiet."
Sir, we haven't done anything.
Sir...where are you taking us?
Get down.
- Come on.
Keep walking down.
- Come on.
Sir...we haven't done anything.
Sir...
Trying to be a hero?
- Sir.
Come on.

...these louts loiter about.
Come on.
Didn't she come today?
Exactly what I was saying?
Start the bike.
- It's okay.
How dare you reject me!
Take that, die!
Let's go...let's go.
Drive faster!
- Sister.
Faster, faster!
Didn't anyone see him?
I saw him.
No.
No.
It was him!
You...
Get inside!
How dare you tell the police?
Take that.
Get lost!

Smile. It's okay.
Don't be disheartened.
We'll always be with you.
Your face's scarred, but that doesn't

Smile, that's it.
That's more like it.
"Your face is like a flower."
oh my...
Greetings, my lady...!
This has become a daily routine.
Why doesn't someone
take action against them?
What a gorgeous girl...
Look here.
Your sister-in-law.
- She must be your sister-in-law.
Sweetheart, look this way.
Make me your sweetheart.
Amazing.
Madam.
You see, madam.
Hello...hello.
<i>HEY-</i>
You..
Wait.
Someone help her.
- Anyone.
Someone help her.
Mister.

a huge vote-bank supporting him.'
'Your Honor,
this girl assaulted my client first.'
'It was an unprovoked attack.'

'..that this crazy girl
brutally assaulted three boys.'
'In light of all the evidence..'
'..the court decides to send Akira
to the Child Correction facility..'
'..until we reach a verdict.'
'And this way...it took three
years to prove Akira's innocence.'
Akira.
- Yes.
Listen.
- I am listening. Go ahead.
Your brother's arriving
from Mumbai today.
He called yesterday.
Why?
He's calling me to Mumbai.
I mean you and me.
To stay with him.
Mumbai?
- Yeah.
I am not going anywhere.
Look, Akira, stop arguing.
He's coming after a very long time.
Come home soon from college.
When he went against your wishes..
...and married that Mumbai-girl,
you swore never to see his face again.
He's worried about his child,
that's why he's calling us.
He's calling you to
wash his kid's soiled pants.
He never called all these years.
And now when they can't handle
the child, he calls everyday.
I am not leaving Jodhpur
and going anywhere.
Akira.
We're here.
- Yes.
<i>Thank you, Am.
- Yeah.</i>
I'll see you in the evening.
- Definitely.
Thank you.
Grandma, how are you?
I am fine.
Ajay, you returned home after so long.
What to do, grandma?
I was busy with work.
See you later.
- Okay.
Mom.
Excuse me, madam.
- Yes.
The principal wants to meet Akira.
I'll try talking to her.
Come in.
Sit down.
- No, I am fine.
We were just talking about you.
It's a good thing that..
...your brother wants
to take both of you to Mumbai.
To look after you two.
Why are you saying no?
Well...the new
semester's just started.
And I've already wasted so many years.
Uncle...l can easily get
her admission in Mumbai.
I know the principal at Holy
Cross Arts and Science College..
...really well.
I'm like a father to you.
There's no scope for further
education in this small city.
If you go to Mumbai..
...it'll really help
your higher studies.
The door's open.
Come in.
Hey"
Mom...Akira,
this is Shilpa.
Come in.
Bless you...it's alright.
Oh, sorry..
- It's okay. Bless you.
Come, I'll show you. Give it.
Come.
Sorry, wrong house.
You...wrong house.
Sid.
- Hi, sis.
Come.
That's my brother.
May I come in?
- Yeah.
He lives here with us.
- I see.
Sid.
Hello, aunt.
- Hello, son.
He's planning to go abroad..
...to do his Doctorate in Finance.
Doctor!
Yes.
It's really hard work, isn't it?
Doctors are highly respected.
This is great.
Now we've a doctor at home.
Son, I've got severe pain
in my knee for three months.
Take a look. - Sorry, aunt...I'm
not the kind of doctor you think.
I am doing Finance..
I mean...l am doing a doctorate
in money-management.
PhD! It's like a degree.
Well, that's good.
Doctors don't get much respect.
You can find a bunch of
them at every nook and corner.
Yes, aunt...that's why..
Actually, he also works
in a Social Welfare Organization..
...along with a few of his friends.
'Raindrops.'
- I see.
He does social work.
Forget that,
let's play squash today.
I don't mind,
but you will lose again.
I'll let you win.
Listen..
- Stop talking. Sid, eat.
Akira, the principal's
called us at 11 am.
And it'll take around
two hours to get there.
We'll get you a local-train pass.
So that you can easily
commute to and fro.
I'll stay at the hostel.
Why will you stay in the hostel?
Yeah, Akira? Why the hostel?
The hostel rent,
canteen expenses...
It's unnecessary..
Ajay...
Why are you forcing her?
If she wants to stay in the hostel,
then let her.
We shouldn't have a problem.
She will visit us
often...during her holidays.
Akira, Ajay's told me everything.
Don't worry,
you won't be wasting this year.
You...just concentrate
on your studies.
Thank you.
About the hostel?
Father, I talked to you over
the phone about that hostel room.
Yeah..
Yes, Father.
Sister d'Mello, is there
any room available in the hostel?
No, Father.
We had four students from
Nasik as well, asking for rooms.
But we couldn't help them either.
What can we do?
But we do have Room No.
17, which we never consider.
Yes...but..
- What's the problem in Room No. 17?
Last year, one of the students
committed suicide in that room.
Since then...no one
is willing to stay there.
It's been closed since then.
- Father, I don't have a problem.
I can live there.
Akira, someone committed suicide..
- It's okay.
Excuse me.
Dad, weren't you looking for this?
- Where was it?
You forgot it in the kitchen
while talking to mom.
I'll get some
privacy...I'll live there.
But, Akira,
someone committed suicide..
Don't discourage her
if she wants to live there.
No, Father, I was just..
- Leave that.
Ajay, remember we discussed about a
donation for the old church.
Yes.
- Here it is.
Yes.
The college campus is 55 acres wide.
Father's home is
in the campus as well.
There's an old church as well,
which has been closed for a long time.
Father's been collecting
donations for its renovation.
There's a school here too?
- Yes.
But only for deaf and dumb children.
But it's under the same management.
Come.
Ma'am...my iPod's missing.
Missing?
- Yes.
Since when?
It was on my bed,
I just went to the next room.
When I returned, it was missing.
Always lock your room.
I've told you so many times.
I am fed up of these
thefts every week.
Here's the 'Missing' register.
Fill in the details.
We'll inform you if we find anything.
Here.
See...keep your belongings carefully,
and always lock them away.
Yes.
This is the one.
I'll get the room
cleaned up by evening.
Good stuff.. Must be from down South.
Sir..
- Yes.
Sir, should I drive?
- Why?
You're a bit..
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Give me the alcohol tester.
Yes.
Sir.
Check yourself,
it's within the limit.
But, sir, this is something else.
If you lose control..
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
He's a new recruit,
and wants to test my control.
No, sir.
Let's show him my control.
Let it be, sir.
Sir..
Sir, careful.
Rane, sir.. Rane sir, careful.
It's okay, sir.
What's this?
Oh, God!
Don't say anything, sir.
I am new, but why did you get scared?
This is the first time he hit
the brakes on time.
Get in.
All his creations...
are in the form of couplets.
And his main subjects are religion,
ethics and preaching.
Niki.
- Sir, it's a strike.
Sit down everyone!
Strike? What for?
Sir, the canteen food is horrible.
Even the rats are falling sick, sir.
So everyone suggested
that if we complain together..
...then maybe the
contractor will change.
Do you have to do
all this during class?
Can't you do it during lunch-break?
Do you want to join them?
- Yes, sir, we'll go too.
Let's go.
Strike for this, strike for that...
everyone wants to be the next CM.
So, I was saying..
From literature's point of view..
- Are you special?
Don't disturb those
who don't want to join you.
You can all go.
She's crazy.
- Niki, we'll deal with her later.
So where were we?
What's going on there?
Sorry.
Madam, she still doesn't
like the canteen food.
Manik.
- Sir.
Should I drive?
- No, sir. I'll drive.
Where's my lighter?
Is it under your seat?
Watch out!
Hey"
What are you doing?
Such disregard for traffic rules.
Hey"
First you rammed a police-car.
And now you're creating a scene.
What do you mean by police-car?
Aren't there any
traffic rules for you?
And you weren't even
wearing a seatbelt.
Hey...
Uncle, you would've
been squashed like a bug.
Say thank you and leave.
Enough of this nonsense.
Hello, sir. I'm not talking nonsense.
He's showing me the finger.
Do you want me to
explain politely?
Sir...he's a college professor,
show some manners.
Oh, Professor.
What are you doing?
Sir, are you okay?
Sir, careful.
Come back, sir.
And they call themselves
police officers.
They have their own rules.
- Are you hurt?
Sir...l am telling you,
it must be a mistake.
I am sure he didn't know
that he was a professor.
Take my complaint right
now and lodge an FIR.
Sir, it's a small matter.
Don't blow it out of proportion.
I am telling you,
there's nothing I can do about it.
Come, sir. We'll show them.
Let's go.
Everyone sign this,
we'll take this to the commissioner.
The police assaulted our
professor without a reason.
Everyone sign this.
The police think they can do anything.
And they refused to file a complaint.
We'll show them the power of students.
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.
The police must apologize!
The police must apologize!
Control Room! Control Room!
A huge crowd has gathered here.
Please send forces immediately.
The police must apologize!
We want...
- Justice.
Step back.
Step back.
You cannot block the roads.
Please disperse.
- We won't tolerate it.
Get up...don't sit here!
- We won't tolerate it.
Clear the roads.
Get out of here.
The police must apologize!
Sir...
- Manik, are you a kid?
Don't talk to them, just kick them
out before the Commissioner arrives.
Okay, sir.
Yes, charge at them.
- Sir.
Charge...phone..
Don't know.
Get them out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Get up...get out of here.
Leave us.
The police must apologize!
Get rid of them.
Get them out. Come on.
Sir, one of your officers
assaulted our professor.
Sir, they were hurling stones at us...
uprooting rods.
Shinde was bleeding.
- And you panicked.
No, sir, that's not it.
You wouldn't have fired,
if you hadn't panicked.
All you had to do was break a few bones.
It was a small matter.
Sir..
Where's the bottle of water?
Sir, Bapurao took it to the bathroom
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
I had mixed vodka in
that bottle which he took.
His backside will start dancing.
Call him.
Yes..
- See if he's done or not.
Bapurao!
- Coming.
Let's go.
Bloody thing...it burns.
Manik, you know what to
say in the inquiry. - Yes, sir.
Hey"
Bloody hell, he'll definitely die.
Oh no...
He rammed the car, sir.
Hello..
Looks like he'd decided to die today.
He didn't wear seatbelts either.
The tire burst, sir.
The airbags didn't open either.
The speed at which he came in,
lam sure he's dead.
Sir...let's put him in our
jeep and take him to the hospital.
Waste of time, Rajeshwar!
No point.
What happened? Is he dead?
Seems like it.
No movement in the body.
Doesn't this area fall
under Inspector Khamkar?
That baldy..
- Yeah..
Panvel-Panchayat area.
Sir. Look what's here.
Is it full of money?
Check it.
Yes.
Looks like about 70-80 cr.
- Easily.
What do you think we should do?
Your call, sir.
All clear, sir!
- Such a lonely place and so much money!
Did you find Khamkar's number?
I say let's handle this by ourselves.
What say?
It's a gift - we can
all settle down comfortably.
But, sir..
The Goddess of Wealth
is knocking at your door..
...but you'd rather stand in the queue!
Don't worry,
I'll arrange everything.
Manik, come.
- Sir.
Bapurao.
Yeah..
Rajeshwar.
- Yes, sir.
Keep it down.
Bapurao.
Hey, stop!
Leave the bag!
Everything's already messed up.
What...
'News about the increasing number of
thefts in the city over the month.'
'And the recent news of robbery at
Ghanshyam Das Jewellers in Kandivali.'
What's wrong? Not in the mood?
Going home?
I am talking to you.
ACP sir,
why are you wearing your clothes?
Take them off and come here.
I've something more important to do.
Will you please finish your drink
in the hall?
I've to make a call.
It's an official call.
There is tension
at many places in Maharashtra.
After the attack on North Indian
auto drivers in Pune..
...many people have left the city.
'We received news of five
road-accidents in and around Mumbai.
The total number
of casualties is four.
Hello.
- Sir.
Manik, did you watch the news?
- Yes, sir, I did.
Our matter simply disappeared into
thin air along with the other news.
The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy.
Listen, we made one mistake.
When I hit him with the jack, I
should've hit him on the face instead.
It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back instead.
Now...keep a close watch on
the post-mortem and don't slip up.
Listen, carefully explain
to Bapurao and Rajeshwar...
...what to do with
the rest of the money.
Yes, sir.
And from now on, call
me on my new number.
Write it down.
Yes, sir.
988...
"...and don't slip up."
"Listen, carefully explain
to Bapu Rao and Rajeshwar.."
"..what to do with
the rest of the money."
"And from now on call
me on my new number."
"Write it down."
"988...4205869."
"Happy Birthday to you.."
Such a big prize
- and you got it so easily.
Where did you record this?
In my bedroom.
Around 11 months ago,
I got caught in a hotel raid.
He took my number and address..
...but he didn't register any case.
He released me without
taking any money.
But after that..
...he started coming
home whenever he wanted.
At first I didn't
take it too seriously.
I thought he's a police
officer after all..
...someday he'll come in handy.
But then he started bugging
me - romance and what not.
I wanted to get rid of him.
And just last week, I fixed
this camera in my bedroom..
...so that he'd stop harassing me.
Call it fate,
look what I got my hands on.
And immediately called you guys.
If we make a plan,
we can extort all the money from him.
Maya, if this didn't
involve the police..
...we could've handled
anyone else easily.
And this guy's the ACP.
If he finds out,
he'll charge us with a fake case..
...and kill all of us.
If we make a foolproof plan..
...then we could all go back
to Gorakhpur and live happily.
I don't want to get
into this police mess.
Maya, when you called I thought..
...maybe some college
student or software engineer..
...has fallen head-over-heels for you.
Look, this is quite risky.
You won't be able
to get out of this one.
Let's go.
- Come on.
<i>Sun“.</i>
Listen...
take a day's time.
Think...
and let me know tomorrow.
Didn't I already tell you?
Look, do whatever you want.
But don't ever bring
this matter up again.
Let's go.
- It's getting late.
Your bill, ma'am.
Thanks.
Where is it?
Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am.
Those students who were
here - do they come regularly?
I don't know, ma'am.
What happened?
There was a camera in my bag,
but now it's missing.
They just passed by my table.
I didn't notice, ma'am.
Do you know them?
I think they were Holy
Cross college students.
Holy Cross college students!
And now finally,
a small speech by Akira.
Good evening.
Actually, Father and the lecturers
asked me to give a speech suddenly..
...so I haven't prepared much.
But since its World Disabled Day..
...it reminded me of
something my father said.
My father
We can't hear you!
I think the Mike is not working.
- We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
What's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
Sir, there's a problem
with the connection.
It'll take a while, sir.
I'll see what's wrong?
We can't hear you!
We can't hear you!
"A disabled person isn't someone
who doesn't have a limb.."
"..it's someone who
doesn't use the limbs."
"Hands that don't come forth
to help others are 'disabled'."
"The eyes that ignore atrocities...
are 'disabled'."
"Feet that turn away and desert
their parents are 'disabled'."
Niki, we must do something about her.
Stop here.
How much?
- Let it be.
It's okay.
I can't take money from you.
I see...
then come every day at 8 am.
Madam..
It's not a government vehicle.
Here you go.
Good morning, sir.
- Rabiya madam...
Back again?
Are you looking
to score a century in transfers?
The straight path
is often the twisted one, sir.
Did you come with family, or..
- No, sir, I've come alone.
Alone?
Okay?
- Okay, sir.
Hello.
"Manik, did you watch the news?"
"Our matter disappeared into
thin air along with other news."
"The rest is a piece of cake...
easy-peasy."
"Listen, we made one mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack,..
...I should've hit him
on the face instead."
"It would've looked like an accident.
But I hit him on the back."
"Now...keep a close watch on
the post-mortem and don't slip up."
"Listen, what to do with
the rest of the money..."
'The number you've
called is currently switched off.'
We should've been more careful, sir.
I never thought she would
do such a thing with me.
Her house is locked and she's missing.
Even her phone's switched off.
She's a hooker;
won't be easy to trap her.
Will she be asking
for a share in the money..
...or ask for all of it?
Wonder who else is in this with her?
Don't let the word spread.
- Yes.
Sir, the call made to
you was from a prepaid number.
The SIM Card...has been issued
to this college ID.
First year student,
Holy Cross College.
And listen...they've asked
me to pay the hostel fee next week.
Please tell brother to pay it.
Yes, l..
I've to make an urgent call.
Enough!
Break her face!
Hey"
Seen a girl in a blue shirt?
So? Are you scared now?
Please forgive me.
I've already wasted
three years of my college.
Now if I thrash you people too,
I'll get in trouble again.
What?
I see...you were hiding here,
so you don't thrash us.
Stop talking to her.
I don't want to fight.
Listen to me.
Please tell them,
was it my fault?
You were picking on me for no reason.
We'll go, just wait a minute.
David, Pooja said
you were looking for me.
Nothing important..
You always used to listen to music
on your phone, with the headphones.
Where is it? I don't see it.
My phone's been stolen.
I went to wash my
face and it disappeared.
I even made an entry
in the 'Missing' register.
Why? What happened?
- Nothing.
Just asked.
I'll tell you if I find it.
- Okay. - Thank you.
Okay-
The college wants to
catch him red-handed, sir.
So, the call I received
was from a stolen phone.
This means...whoever stole
the phone is still in the hostel.
And before the hostel guys find him,
we must find him first.
You two will keep an eye on Maya's
home, as well as the hostel. - Sir.
Here's your fare.
Hello.
- Sir, it's me.
She's here.
Get inside and tie her up.
- Sir, me?
I am coming!
Where is she?
What happened?
You dare record my phone
calls and threaten me?
You wanted to extort money from me?
Me?
- No.
How did you record the call?
Tell me how did you record the call?
With a handycam!
Look at me..
Where's your handycam?
- Stolen.
What? Stolen?
Someone stole it at the coffee shop.
I didn't see his face.
But I know he's a student
at Holy Cross College.
What were you doing
at the coffee shop?
What were you doing
at the coffee shop?
Tell me the truth,
or I will break your face.
You won't get another
customer or a lover.
Why did you take the
camera to the coffee shop?
I went to meet a couple of friends.
Did you show them the video?
Did you show them the video?
So three more people know now.
She's spoiled it all.
Messed it up!
She's messed us up!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya!
Maya! Maya!
What was the name of the coffee shop?
Coffee shop..
Wretch.
Did she say the
name of the coffee shop?
She didn't say anything.
I'm going through a real bad phase.
Go on.
Madam.
The kohl's completely smeared.
Seems she cried a lot
before committing suicide.
Right, madam. I deduced that too.
She cried her heart out.
She... looks tense too.
This is definitely a suicide.
Her cheeks are swollen too.
Maybe someone beat
her up and made her cry.
And then hung her.
But, madam, the...
door's locked from inside.
Manik, you're so naive.
Locking the door from inside...
is an old grandfather's technique.
The computer's hard disk is missing.
Her cellphone isn't here either.
There was a charger in the bedroom,
did you see it?
You mean that cellphone charger.
It's not a cellphone charger,
it's a video-camera charger.
There's a charger,
but no camera.
Is this Plot No. 401-C?
Who is he?
- Courier, madam.
Come here.
Sign.
Thank you, sir.
What is it, madam?
- Credit card bill.
Beauty parlour,
pub, supermarket, coffee shop.
She swiped her card
in these four places.
Find out where she visited regularly.
Did she go alone or with friends?
Find out more details about her.
Keep this.
- Yes, ma'am.
Actually, Manik, give that to me.
I'll keep it.
Call the forensic people, ask them
when they can get here. - Yes.
I think something's wrong.
Maybe it's a murder.
Looks like it's the handiwork
of at least 3 to 4 people.
Fine, you make the call...
...until then I'll
question the neighbors.
Yes, ma'am.
Bloody Rabia...always honest
- that too on a police salary.
We can't shut her
up with a share either.
You will only follow this case...
and no acting smart.
Rabia should never find out..
...that we're involved in this case.
Sir.
Let's see how far she
Gets, with that baby in her tummy.
Manik.
- Yes, ma'am.
We couldn't locate Maya's
buddies in the coffee shop, right?
Well, I just got their address.
Note it down.
- Madam?
Note it down.
- Y-Yes, ma'am.
House No. 3, Yamuna Nagar,
Malad East.
Sir..
- Where are you taking us?
Don't worry.
Please, sir, we're getting worried.
- We'll tell you everything.
Sir..
- Come on, get it.
It's nothing,
it will be over in 10 minutes.
Where are you taking us, sir?
Get in, come on.
Yes, Manik.
Madam, I found two guys at
the address you gave me.
They willingly got in
the car without any hassle.
But as soon as the car
slowed down at the bend..
...they jumped out and escaped.
We tried catching them, but..
- I see.
See you there, we'll discuss this.
- Okay, madam.
Well, for now,
my life-calling is to go to classes.
Going to Churchgate;
can I drop you someplace?
Thanks.
Okay. See you.
- Bye.
Akira. Take a seat.
How's college? All okay?
Good.
By the way, does anyone in college
know that you've been to jail..
I mean...
that you were in the Remand Home.
No!
That's a good thing.
Who knows how they'll
behave once they find out.
By the way, no one from
my family knows about this.
The other day,
the police came home..
...just for Sid's
passport verification.
And dad was very uncomfortable.
If he finds out about all this, then..
You can keep meeting Sid,
talk to him, be friends..
...but if things go beyond that,
it'll be a problem for all.
No?
Don't worry, that won't happen.
You won't have any
problems because of me.
Hope I didn't hurt you.
It's not that easy to hurt me.
Bapurao.
Yes, sir.
The college is closed for vacations.
- Yes.
Who's going to stay in the hostel now?
We've been standing
out here like madmen.
Madam, please listen.
- Who are you guys?
How did you get in?
Isn't the watchman inside?
We came here to meet a student,
but didn't realize it's the holidays.
Are you alone in the hostel?
- Yes.
I see..
- Who do you want to meet?
L..
- Riya.
She studies in B.Com, third year.
What's her room number?
Isn't this the model
we've been looking for?
Please keep it back,
it's not mine.
How much did you pay for this camera?
- I told you this is not mine.
Please keep it back.
ACP sir's number on the dialing list.
What? ACP who?
Is this your bag?
It was lying outside.
"Listen, I made a mistake."
"When I hit him with the jack.."
Come with us.
- Where? Who are you?
Come on!
"Don't you get it?"
"It's an official call."
"Hello..."
Sir, she's out to get us.
During the college strike,
she gave the file to the commissioner.
Did you ask her, did she
make more copies of this video?
We searched her room,
but found nothing.
And did she tell anyone about this?
What did she say?
The same old thing..
"This isn't my bag,
I don't know where it came from".
If these three spill
the beans to anyone..
...then we'll lose
everything we've made so far.
We must do something quickly.
Plus I've to go to Nasik..
...for a very boring session
with the Home Minister.
Could take a few days.
And it could be dangerous
to keep them alive for three days.
I suggest...that you
end this whole thing.
Don't wait for me to return.
Remember our usual spot?
- Go.
Sir...we haven't done anything.
Come on, get down.
- Where are you taking us?
Keep walking down.
Come on..
We haven't done anything, sir..
Sir..
Trying to be a hero?
Where..
Come on.
Sir..
Come on.
Sit down.
Shut up!
- Sir..
Stop crying-
Here..
- Sir... no!
Sir, no.
- Kill them.
Take it.
Stop crying-
No...
- Sir..
Bloody dog,
don't you get it?
Don't answer that now.
- ACP sir is calling.
No... no..
Yes, sir.
- You got the wrong girl, Manik.
She's not that girl.
But, sir..
Stealing stuff from the hostel,
and making threat calls to me...
...was done by someone else.
Don't shoot her.
- Sir..
Sir..
Sir, my battery's almost dead.
Call on Rajeshwar's cell.
- I didn't bring my mobile.
Sir..
- What does he want?
The phone's switched off.
No charge.
Leave it..
Let's finish the job first.
Shoot them.
Shoot.
Sir, maybe we got the wrong girl.
- What?
Yes.
That's why sir asked us to wait.
She's not that girl.
I haven't done anything!
Bloody lunatic,
why does he keep changing the plan?
And he's saying this now.
Shoot her. We'll deal with this later.
Shoot!
Sir, I am confused.
He said "Don't shoot",
you're saying "Shoot".
Sir, what if this
gets us in trouble later?
You're always so eager
to answer the phone.
I answered only because
ACP sir was calling.
To hell with your ACP!
He must be relaxing at home.
And out here,
we're dealing with the mess.
Bloody..
What's he asking us to do?
Let's call him.
Go.
I need Bapurao with me.
Why?
Sir, to drive the van.
Go.
Come on, start the van.
- Yes.
Come on.
We've orders to let you go.
But you must keep quiet
until they don't return.
Sir, it's Manik.
According to Bapurao's list,
the thefts started last year in March.
And this girl joined now in July.
You fools got the wrong girl.
The details are clearly given
in the list along with the dates.
You just make a copy, bring it to me..
...never read it,
eat snacks off of it!
Let her go.
But, sir...we killed a guy
in front of her.
How can we let her go?
Kill all of them.
- Okay, sir.
Now what?
What's going on?
Bloody..
The belt's broken.
What a piece of junk!
Sir... he says that the
garage is six kilometers away.
Give me your walky.
- Yes.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello...hello, Rajeshwar sir.
Hello..
He's not in range.
He's all alone out there.
I think... if we travel
two kilometers back..
...then his walky will be in range.
Yes.
Hello.
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir, can you hear me?
Rajeshwar sir.
Hello.
What happened?
The van's belt got broken.
What do I do about them?
We've orders to shoot them all.
Hello...sir, did you hear?
Bloody..
Hello, sir.
Hello.
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.
Hello... Rajeshwar sir.
Rajeshwar sir.
"I've a meeting with the minister."
He said he has to go...
and sent us here instead.
So that he's safe.
He's a bloody fraud.
Couldn't he check the
list properly earlier?
Messed everything up by
calling us in the middle of the job.
Let's get that girl
before she talks to anyone.
You're saying...you saw one
of the police officers before?
Yes, Father.
He was there during the strike.
Hello, Andrew, how are you?
- James, I want to meet right now.
Where are you?
I am in Pune...for a court hearing.
What is it?
There's a problem in college.
- I see...what's wrong?
Not on the phone,
let's talk face-to-face.
Just get here as soon
as you can tomorrow morning.
Okay-
Fine, let's meet in the morning.
- Okay, bye. Thanks.
May I go, Father?
I am not staying
at the hostel tonight.
I'll be here tomorrow morning.
Well, if there's a problem,
you can stay here.
There's no problem, Father.
I am going to my brother's home.
I'll be here by tomorrow by <i>7</i> am.
- Okay.
I'll drop you at the station.
It's close by, Father.
I'll manage on my own.
Yes.
Papa, that's my sister, Akira.
Come in, Akira.
That's not the sari.
Then where is it?
There's one less.
Mom's inside.
- Count again.
But you guys must
book a Cool Cab first..
...so that you all get there on time.
How's the place?
Well, it's a great place.
You? So suddenly? What happened?
Who are all these people?
They are Shilpa's relatives.
Her cousin's getting married.
They've come from Pune.
Something to eat?
What happened?
Did you get into a fight?
No, the door slammed on my face.
How can the door..
Wait, I'll put something on it.
- Mom!
I said it's nothing, let it be.
Akira, did you pay
your hostel mess' fee?
Pay it tomorrow.
I want to talk to you.
- Say it.
Ajay.
Ajay.
- What happened?
Check this bill. Something's wrong.
- What happened?
We selected 12 saris, didn't we?
- Yeah.
They billed us for 13 saris.
How's that possible?
Well...l chose 5 silk saris,
but I don't know about the rest.
But l..
- You settled the bill.
Yes.
- You must have counted the saris.
Maybe I checked..
- Did you count them or not?
No, I forgot.
- You didn't count the saris, Ajay.
But.. - How can you do such a thing?
- You check it.
There's no problem.
I kept telling you.
- Let me show you.
These are the ones that I counted.
These are Ritu's saris.
And I already gave aunty her saris.
Right?
There are two 'Chanderis' here..
...and those five silk saris
which I packed myself. - Okay.
What's the total?
12, Ajay...only 12-
How can you pay for 13?
Have you seen this girl?
She just left.. that way.
"Eyes have not been
get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Eyes have not been
get wet for a long time."
"There is life from this pretext."
"Slowly slowly rain comes and fills."
Siddharth, it's Akira.
- Hi.
Can we meet now?
- No, I just finished work.
I am on my way back from Pune.
Was it something urgent?
- No.
Say it.
- No, it's okay.
Hello.
"I am desert,
you fill me with water."
"There eyes clouds.."
"There eyes clouds.."
Give the fried rice
to the kids standing there.
Okay-
Thank you.
Bring that plate.
Okay. - I don't believe it, man.
- Clean that table.
He's always staring at me.
Seriously, he's crazy.
Did you keep that bag in
front of my room at the hostel?
Hello...what bag?
I am talking to you, Niki.
Listen,
I've been keeping my distance.
I don't know about any bag.
Then who kept that bag?
She said she doesn't know anything.
Don't touch me.
I am warning you, Niki...
don't mess with me.
Do you know the trouble
you've caused me?
Wretch...how dare you hit me?
Sir, even the other clay
you were mistaken.. - Shut up!
Bapurao,
arrest everyone and lock them up!
Come on.
Sorry, sir.
- Come on.
What are you looking at?
Come on...get in.
- Sir...
Come on...get in.
Sujata, stop staring..
...and lock the girls up in Cell No. 2.
Get in.
I want to call home.
Make a call! Get in..
Didn't I tell you,
I'd catch her?
I ask you to get one girl;
but you get the whole college!
Botched up the game!
Sir, I thought..
- Don't think. Please.
Now I'll do whatever needs to be done.
Bapurao.
- Sir.
Come on...come out..
Come on.
Come on.
Not you. You stay there.
Listen, everyone.
No one talks about her outside.
Or I'll lock you all up again.
We can't kill her now.
Her college friends
have seen her here.
And there's no telling
what she's said to whom.
So what now, sir?
<i>I'll tell you.</i>
Hi...
How's your mom?
All well.
Good morning, Father.
Swipe for both the cars.
Okay, sir.
Ajay, sorry to disturb you.
Has Akira left for college?
Yes, Father,
she left for the hostel last night.
Why? What's wrong?
Her room's locked..
...and she hasn't appeared for the
college's internal exams either.
What?
Did she tell you anything?
No.
Last night she was trying
to tell me something..
...but, she..
Ask everyone she knows.
And let me know if you speak to Akira.
Sure, Father.
- Don't forget.
Definitely, Father.
I'll call right now.
I'll just call you back.
Brother-in-law. - Akira hasn't
gone to the hostel since last night.
What?
- Her principal just called.
I'll call my volunteers,
ask them to find out.
We'll find her.
Let's file a missing complaint.
And we'll ask my advocate friend..
...how to include that Inspector Manik,
whom she mentioned.
Sir, a missing complaint's been filed.
And Manik's name has been included.
I told you we'd get in deep trouble.
I just spoke with them.
But they are saying the same thing.
"We'll let you know once we find out."
Hello.
Sir..
Speak up.
Sir, we did exactly what you told us.
After this...we won't face any
more problems because of that girl.
All clear, sir.
Stop.
Okay, that's enough for today.
Give her a dose.
When she's conscious again after
four hours.
We'll do it once again.
Yes, doctor.
I'll never talk to you again.
Never
Understand?
How dare you take my doll?
Don't make a racket.
Come, Kamla. It's your turn.
I won't take a bath.
Only mad people bathe every day.
You know, I have a shampoo as well.
What color?
- Yellow.
I don't like yellow.
L...like this green.
- I've green too.
So...shall we go?
- Come on.
Let's go.
Are you a doctor?
- No, we're not doctors.
Then, are you like us?
- Yes, of course.
Then why don't you
wear clothes like us?
We wear such clothes. We like green.
Crazy girl
- that's 'red', not 'green'.
Bedsheets...blanket...green
shampoo. - Okay.
And I was just..
What happened?
<i>Mm? What happened'?</i>
Akira?
Akira!
Akira!
- Akira!
Hello.
But, Rane sir..
- Don't worry, Doctor.
Rajeshwar will be there soon.
Remember, no one should
get suspicious until then.
Okay-
Hello.
Hello.
Hello, this is Amitabh
Bachchan speaking. - Listen.
Okay-
This is Rani speaking.
Can you ask the ten-million
rupee question first?
Come here.
Come here.
Don't get me wrong,
I was just kidding.
What is this place?
This is a big..
- What's the time?
Who is the in-charge here?
Get lost.
Come on..
Get back to general ward.
Madam, what is this place?
Get back.
Who are you?
Sit.
What are you doing?
- Sit down.
Hold her.
What is this?
Come on.
Get up. Look this way.
Akira.
- Akira.
Get up.
Look this way.
Did this girl take drugs?
Drugs?
_ Yes?
Not at all.
No, sir.
And what kind of a question is that?
Hold on, Sid.
Let me talk.
May I know what Akira's done?
What did she do?
She did this.
She hurled a stone at me.
At a police officer.
It missed my eye
just because I ducked.
What day was it? And where?
Last Tuesday at around 11 pm,
I was on patrol duty.
I noticed her from afar.
As soon as she saw me,
she started behaving strangely.
She came up to me and
asked "Are you Manik?“
Why are you roaming here in disguise?
I thought to myself
that something is wrong.
I got down from my bike,
and was parking it..
...when she hurled a stone at me.
Thankfully I ducked,
but it hit my head and I fell down.
I arrested her immediately..
...and brought her to the
police station to file an FIR.
But even at the police station..
...she kept saying
to the entire staff..
"Four police officers
were trying to kill me."
"They killed two boys but I escaped."
I knew it's a charade.
Or she's mentally ill.
Ma'am, did she ever hit
her head when she was a kid?
Any such incident...
which could explain this behavior?
It happened long ago.
She threw acid on a boy's face.
She was sent to a
children's remand home.
She even stayed there.
- That's it.
Didn't I say something's wrong?
Something's definitely wrong.
That's why I immediately
brought her to the doctor..
I mean psychiatrist, for treatment.
And the tests were positive.
What's the actual problem?
She's affected by recurrent
persistent delusion. Type 2.
In simpler words, such patients..
...always gets confused
between reality and fantasy.
They believe one of their fantasies
to be true, and starts reacting.
Akira believes that the
police are following her..
...and they'll kill
her in an encounter.
Due to this imagination, she's
behaving strangely amongst people.
No...no need to worry.
She'll be fine soon.
It's okay, mom...it's okay.
They're saying she'll be okay.
It's okay, mom.
Now eat.
You must finish all of it.
Come on, eat.
You'll get more, now eat.
Your sit here. Sit here.
First finish this.
Come on, eat.
You'll get water, wait.
Eat from your plate.
<i>Hey...go away
GM. '</i>
Akira.
Are you okay?
"Someone cast an evil eye on me, my
Hello.
Did you eat breakfast?
What's the time?
How long have you
been in this hospital?
Almost two years..
I keep coming and going.
It's been going on like that.
Is it difficult to get out of here?
Well...it's very difficult
to leave with permission.
But without permission...
it's less difficult.
Can you do something for me?
Hello, Father. I am SP Rabiya.
Mumbai Crime Branch.
Please sit.
Well...there's a coffee shop,
close to your college.
Around 500 meters away.
I am sure you know.
- Yes, I know.
On the 25th of last month..
...12 students from your college
celebrated a birthday there.
And one of them stole a handycam..
...from a customer's bag.
Go back..
Later I saw the coffee
shop's CCTV footage.
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Out of those 12 students..
...that one girl could be
seen stealing the camera.
But we couldn't see her face,
she was wearing a cap.
So I started looking
for all the students..
...whose faces could
be seen in the video.
She's a 2nd year, Commerce Student.
And that's Bharat,
3rd year Mathematics student.
And he's a...2nd year
Mathematics student as well.
And who's this? This girl?
She's Ana.
The Principal's daughter.
Aha?
I want to see the handycam
which your daughter stole.
Hi.
Did you go to the coffee
shop with your friends?
When?
Which coffee shop?
You've been caught red-handed.
You've been caught stealing.
- Sir!
You've been caught stealing on camera.
- Sir...please..
You've ruined my name and respect.
How will I face the students?
Go get the handycam you
stole from the coffee shop.
I want to see it.
- I am ruined..
In a way, I'm the one
who encouraged this thief.
In every meeting in the hostel..
...I would tell the students, that..
"Whoever is committing these thefts
in the hostel should mend their ways."
"And keep everything
that's stolen in a bag.."
"..and leave it
anywhere in the hostel."
"We won't take any
action against this person."
'I didn't know that the
thief's living in our own home.'
"Go, die somewhere."
'The college was
shut down for holidays...
'...when I discovered...'
'...that my own
daughter was the thief'
'All the students had gone home.
Only Akira was staying in the hostel.'
'That's why I left
that bag outside her room.'
'So that when Akira
finds the bag outside her room..'
'..she'd bring it to me immediately.'
Then I would've told everyone that the
thief has returned everyone's stuff.
And I would've distributed
everything back through the warden.
And this problem could've been solved.
But Akira didn't show up that night.
Next day when I went to the hostel,
the room was locked.
That same night, Akira came home..
...and said that there was
a bag lying outside her room.
As she opened to take a look,
two policemen arrived.
They took the handycam and mobile from
the bag, and kidnapped her as well.
And they took two boys along,
whom they killed.
Only Akira survived.
After Akira left, I asked her again..
...and she admitted to stealing
the handycam from the coffee shop.
And also told me about
the foolishness she did by keeping it.
I study hard as well...
but it's never enough for dad.
He never missed a single
opportunity to insult me.
He even hit me in front of my friends.
Finally I got fed up,
and did all this to hurt him.
And unknowingly, it became a habit.
Sorry.
You said sorry so easily.
Do you how many lives
your childishness has ruined?
He plays well.
He'll whack any ball.
Want to bet?
We're definitely losing.
Look, he hit the shot.
Didn't I tell you?
<i>HEY-</i>
Stop!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Why you...
Stop.
Hey, stop.
Stop.
Ajay...Ajay, what is all this?
Your sister's standing outside
our door in such a strange condition.
Akira!
Akira! What are you doing here?
Ajay, I want to talk to you alone.
Akira...what are you doing here?
You're under treatment, aren't you?
How can you...
Nothing's wrong with me, mom.
- We know nothing's wrong with you.
But you must finish your treatment.
There's nothing wrong with me,
so why should I get treatment?
Ajay, please listen to me.
- Fine, tell me.
Last Tuesday I came here.
- Not Tuesday, you came on Wednesday.
Yes..
- One day before the wedding.
I did come on Wednesday too.
But I came one day before that too.
You and mom were not at home.
You can ask Shilpa.
That day, when you were upset with me.
Tell them.
But, Akira,
why would Shilpa be upset with you?
Ask her later, but
when I went back ..
...there was a bag
lying outside my room.
As soon as I opened it,
two policemen barged in!
Yes, we know. Father told us.
Because I told Father.
That day, after I escaped
from that encounter spot..
...I met Father first.
And then I came here.
Akira, none of this happened.
It's just your delusion.
Why will the police
try to kill you, Akira?
I mean...there's no reason.
The inspector whom you assaulted,
took you to the psychiatrist.
That doctor checked you..
- That bloody doctor...is a liar.
They want to help you, dear.
- Help me?
Unbelievable, mom.
They want to drive me crazy.
Just tell me how you got here.
Catch her!
From the hospital.
She beat us up and escaped!
Catch her.
Hold on.
- No.
Akira, no.
- Akira.
They give me electric shocks..
- No.
Akira.
Leave me.
Careful.
Ajay.. Ajay, no!
Mom..
- Akira, just listen to them.
Don't let them take me!
Calm down, dear.
- Save me, mom.
All will be well.
- No!
Be brave.
- They...give me shocks...
Electric shocks...
She's calmed down.
Get the wheelchair.
Stop.
Excuse me.
I am SP Rabia.
I want to see a patient called Akira.
Where's her ward?
Thanks for saving me.
Who says thanks for
something like that?
My own family doesn't trust me.
I'm sure everyone in
college thinks I'm crazy too.
Giving you shocks...
and those injections..
...it's the doctor's doing.
If we catch him,
everything'll be fine.
Wear this.
Wait here.
- Yes, I'll be right here.
Akira...madam.
How could you do
something so cheap?
Tell me.
Forgive me, please.
Sorry?
' Sorry?
Sorry?
Sorry
You're going to say sorry?
Will your apology
make everything alright?
My own family thinks I'm crazy.
No, no...no...forgive me.
Tell me...tell me the truth?
How much did they pay you?
- Madam...they forced me to do this.
That's why I had to do all this.
If you are right,
why will they force you?
Few clays ago...
a patient died accidentally..
...while I was giving
him shock treatment.
These cops helped me
in closing that matter smoothly.
That's all...nothing more.
Come on. Get up.
Wear your shirt and come with me.
- Where, madam?
To tell my family, the principal
and the entire college that you lied.
Help me!
Someone help me!
Help me!
Please help me.
What did he say?
- He said he's at the club.
Club.
Come on.
Someone's coming.
Rani, come here.
Is this the ladies toilet?
- Yes.
Sorry.
What is this man..
He came in the wrong toilet,
so we beat him up.
Sorry, I had a little too much.
I'll leave.
Rani.
- Yes.
Lift him up
Hello.
- Brother, it's me again.
Do you have any news yet?
No.
It's been three days.
I've been waiting for him.
Not yet.
Again, the same story!
Listen.. - A policeman's missing,
and the police has no clue.
How is this possible?
Have faith in me.
- I can trust you, right?
Absolutely.
- Really?
Yes.
Sir... Rajeshwar sir's wife.
She keeps calling
us over and over again.
She's in the village; very frightened.
She wants to come here..
...and file a 'Missing' complaint.
I managed her for now, but..
This money mess..
I've fixed...
my daughter's marriage.
If Rajeshwar sir spills the beans..
...then I will be ruined, sir.
- Bapurao!
Get up! Get up.
So what if he's scared?
Will he open his mouth?
You're making a mistake.
- What?
I am making a mistake?
You guys turn my life into a joke..
...and you say I'm making a mistake?
Should I blow your brains out?
Just because they sent
me to a remand home as a kid..
...everyone looked down on me.
And now...this taint of being crazy.
Just being treated at the mental
hospital means your life is over.
Why did you people do this to me?
Why did you people falsely accuse me?
Tell me.
Madam, these numbers match.
Good, file this separately.
Okay-
Take a picture of all this.
Okay, ma'am.
Look, ma'am.
Yes, this one too.
Get me the details of
the driver of the crashed car.
Most importantly,
the person who claimed the insurance.
Okay-
Since we received a complaint
of Rajeshwar's disappearance..
...these three have been missing too.
No one at the police
station knows anything either.
And their cellphones are off too.
We must arrest them
and keep them inside.
Yeah...the TV and Press
will humiliate us for a few days.
But we'll handle that.
Hello. - Hello, Siddharth.
Akira speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- Listen to me carefully.
Go on.
The college's annual day
function is tomorrow at 9:30 am.
The entire campus will
gather at the auditorium.
Bring Ajay and mother along,
I'll meet you there.
Inspector Rajeshwar is with me.
And he's ready to tell everyone
how these policemen wanted to kill me.
Okay-
Who's call is it, Sid?
- Akira.
Akira...Akira, where are you?
We're so worried..
- Ajay, I've told Siddharth everything.
Yeah, but..
- Bring mother along.
Don't make any excuses.
- Fine, but listen to me..
Akira...hello.
Hello.
What did she say?
She..
Yes, ma'am.
- I am SP Rabiya, Crime Branch.
"Inspector Rajeshwar is with me."
"He's ready to talk about
how these cops wanted to kill me."
"When they didn't succeed.."
"..they proved that I am delusional
with Dr. Santosh Tiwari's help.."
"..and locked me up
at the Thane mental asylum."
"Rajeshwar has agreed to say this.."
"..in front of the media,
the court and the entire college."
Agreed?
How can he agree?
I was telling you, sir.
He must be scared, right?
Sir, we've traced the location
of Rajeshwar sir's mobile.
The signal was coming from the tower..
...close to Holy Cross College.
Sir... a lot of students live
around the college as paying guests.
If she's hiding in
one of those buildings..
...it'll take days to find her.
What time is the college
function tomorrow? - 10 am.
Is that person over
there your principal?
Yes.
Who's with him?
Actually...he's the vice-principal.
Sir.
Sir, I just saw that mad person..
...head towards the
building near the ground.
No one's allowed to go there.
The structure's too weak. .
Did you check behind the building?
- No, sir.
The principal's arrived.
He's sitting on the front seat.
You must tell everyone...
exactly what you told me.
Get it?
If you try to act smart,
I'll shoot you.
Rani!
Sir!
She's run out of bullets, sir!
Quiet.
- Sir!
Come on. Get up.
Stop!
- Manik.
Get on your knees!
Get on your knees!
Hands at the back!
Hands at the back!
Bapurao.
Stay still or else I'll shoot.
Wretch.
Leave it.
Leave her.
You should've done something
when she kidnapped you.
What's the point of
showing your machismo now?
Sir, do you know
what happened that day?
Don't talk nonsense.
Nonsense? I am talking nonsense?
A college student and
a mad person abduct you..
...thrash you...and mess you up.
There's nothing you could do
and you're showing your anger now.
I see.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Here.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your FIR report..
Two mad people stole
tools from the mortuary.
And...they abducted Rajeshwar
and brought him here.
By the time we got
here to save Rajeshwar..
...they'd already severed his hand.
Bapurao.
And we had no other choice.
So, in order to save Rajeshwar,
we had to kill these two.
Now shoot her in the forehead.
Manik...you'll do no such thing.
You cleverly slip
out of every situation.
You have a gun, don't you?
You shoot her! Shoot her!
Get your hands and limbs severed.
Why do you always ride
the gun on our shoulders?
Don't be crazy.. - You've been doing
crazy things from the beginning..
...and you're calling me crazy?
Don't you know how to
talk to your senior? - Hey!
You're my senior only
when we're in the department.
Out here, I am senior to you in age,
and you're my junior.
Bloody fool, talking nonsense.
Hey.. - Leave me!
- Be quiet...
He'll create problems with the girls..
...and ask us to deal with it.
And sit at home by himself...
"I am in Nasik."
"..in a meeting with the minister."
He talks too much.
Manik.
- Sir.
Your new FIR report.
These two kidnapped Rajeshwar
and brought him here.
We followed them here.
We killed that mad person
and saved Rajeshwar.
Arrested this girl.
We were taking the girl..
...when she snatched
my gun and shot Rajeshwar.
Next...she tried to kill me.
That's when you..
Go back 10 feet from your position.
And shoot her.
Shoot her, Manik.
Back.
Shoot.
Manik.
Hands UP!
Manik, throw down your gun.
Here she comes again.
Or else we'll have to shoot.
Rabiya, do you even know
what happened here?
Don't act without knowing the facts.
I know everything, sir.
Right from the accident
on Mumbai-Pune Highway..
...to sending this girl
to the mental asylum, everything.
I know everything.
You can't kill her
and hide the truth anymore.
And even the commissioner
knows about it.
We've orders to arrest you, sir.
Please throw your guns down.
Manik.
Throw your gun down.
Sir, please.
Amar.
- Ma'am.
Get their guns.
They killed my friend.
Her body is lying
somewhere at the back.
Rafiq, go check.
Yes, ma'am.
Do you know everything?
- Yes, I do.
May <i>I</i> go now?
It's the commissioner?
Hello, sir.
- Where are you?
Behind Holy Cross College,
in the old church.
What happened?
- We've arrested them, sir.
Don't arrest them, Rabiya.
There's a problem.
Why, sir?
The guy they murdered on the highway..
...was the brother of North Indian
Party's top leader, Bablu Tiwari.
Remember...he was involved in
provoking riots in the city before.
This year his party
is claiming to host..
...the biggest 'Chhat
Puja' event in Mumbai.
Due to which there is already growing
tension amongst the local parties.
That money was being
brought in for that event.
If the news leaks out, that his
brother didn't die in an accident..
...but in fact, a few Mumbai police
officers murdered him for the money..
...then Bablu Tiwari
will provoke riots again.
And so I spoke with the Secretariat..
...and the higher authorities
and made this decision.
So end the case right
here and close the file.
So please follow my orders.
Don't arrest them.
But sir, two murders
have been committed here.
Inspector Rajeshwar and
a mad person's been shot.
Look, Rabiya, they are going
to prepare a fake report anyway.
I promise a full inquiry
against Rane and his entire team.
They will definitely
get a life sentence.
And that girl Akira.. - You're
thinking about saving one girl..
...and I am thinking about
thousands of innocent people.
Please understand.
This has now become a national issue.
And so...we must keep
this under wraps..
...until the 'Chhat Puja'
isn't over next month.
But, sir,
the media's already standing outside.
I cannot lie to them.
Rabiya, give the phone to ACP Rane.
Yes, sir.
Commissioner sir.
Hello, sir.
ACP Rane, so you're above the law now?
You'll do as you want.
- No, sir, actually..
Do you have any idea..
...that your action has stirred
up a law and order situation.
Now listen carefully.
- Yes, sir. Sure.
You've to pretend before the media..
...that Akira is an
escaped mental patient.
And don't mess it up.
- Okay, sir. We'll handle it.
Understand.
Yes, sir. Sure, sir.
Rabiya madam,
you can take your team and go back.
Manik.
- Sir.
Call the hospital, and call
an ambulance to take her back.
Sir.
Bapurao.
- Yes, sir.
Make that girl sit in a corner.
Yes, sir.
What happened, madam?
I can come with you, right?
We cannot handle this
case anymore, Akira.
They've been asked to
take charge of this case now.
Them?
But they are responsible for all this.
How can they handle it?
Bapurao,
don't just sit there and stare.
Make her sit in a corner until
the ambulance doesn't arrive.
Sir.
Why should I go back to the hospital?
Sorry, Akira,
but I can't help you right now.
But...what's the problem?
If your case gets registered,
it will turn into a communal issue.
And the riots can..
...lead to the loss
of many innocent lives.
Only you can save this
city from burning up again.
And so they are going to keep
you in the hospital for a while..
...and then let you go.
I am sorry, but...
there's no other choice, Akira.
How can you say that?
They tried to kill a girl.
Together they tried
to prove that I'm crazy.
Arrest them!
Will you send me back to the asylum
too in order to cover up the truth?
I am sorry, the department will
definitely give you compensation..
...and I will try..
- Bapu Rao. - Compensation?
What do you mean by compensation?
Come on.
You mean first you
gouge both my eyes out..
...and then give me
an expensive walking-stick.
Please cooperate with them.
Believe me, it can..
What's more that can happen?
You should've killed me instead.
'That day my hands were tied,
but not Akira's.'
Madam! Madam!
Ma'am, their guns?
- Keep it.
Sir.
Let go.
- Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Let go. Let go.
Madam..
Please, madam.
'If your case gets registered,
it'll turn into a communal issue.'
'And the riots can..'
'..lead to the loss
of many innocent lives.'
'Only you can save this
city from burning up again.'
Akira.
What...what's she saying?
She's saying that she
nailed herself to the cross.
'Since the report that deemed
Akira mentally ill, was fake..'
...I made sure that no case
was registered against her,'
'A few days later, she was
fully exonerated and she went home...'
'...where she began to follow
the path her father had shown her.'
'I want every daughter of this country,
including mine...to become like Akira.'
'Someone who learns to live
on the basis of her own strength.'
Very good.
"New paths are ahead.
New turns are ahead."
"Don't be nervous."
"Keep on going alone
on your own strength."
"Determination is your companion."
"What do you care if darkness
is filled in the whole world."
"Why should your evenings
coax lamps for light."
"Your both eyes are filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"The whole nature is reliant on you."
"You plant moon and stars."
"The sun burns through your heat."
"You are unaware of your miracles."
"You are the ground that
holds lakhs of skies.
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"You are my star filled with light."
"You are my star."
"Star."
