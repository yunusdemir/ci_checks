He's a poet, and she's an actress.
This is the scene in which they meet.
He said poetic things to her.
And she said she understood him.
For six weeks, Bob came by every day.
And he called her...
- Elysian.
He wrote poems
only she knew were for her.
Exams. Had I been here before?
And if so,
did I exist in your surroundings?
Was I the hands in your lap?
Were you the surf, and I the beach?
Were you a bald man,
and I a hat that was nearly
blown into the street?
Was I the whizzing of a swing?
Were you a little girl that closed
her eyes, wanting to disappear?
Though no one ever disappeared swinging.
Were you death, and I
the scythe with which you reaped?
Were you there first, and I the egg?
Were you the answer
to what I always asked?
If not,
were you very lonely without me?
He had a wife who didn't understand him
but with whom he shared 30 years
of his life and a taste of tragedy.
Soon, two years had passed.
By then the poet was tormented,
and the actress was in love.
But their passion didn't fade.
I'm Eva.
I want to write poems too.
But real ones, like Rimbaud.
This is Michelle, my sister.
Actually my half sister.
She's always working.
And this is...
- Fré.
That name sound familiar to you?
I'm your boyfriend.
I'm sorry.
- Do you have to work for much longer?
Would you mind if we postponed it
a couple of days?
I knew you were going to say that.
I knew it. Typical.
Sorry, I'm really busy.
I won't be any fun tonight.
It's been like this the whole week.
It shouldn't be this hard
to get a date with you.
I'd be lying there like a corpse.
Is that romantic?
No, that's wishful thinking.
A hostile uterus? What does that mean?
It means the sperm dies,
because your cervical mucus rejects it.
The strong swimmers can still fertilize
the egg, but it complicates matters.
Your ovulation was
on the right side though.
But how will I ever get pregnant?
We have more chance
of being in a plane crash.
You may get dressed.
This is Barbara, my mom's sister.
And Matthias is her boyfriend.
They're sort of the perfect couple.
- It's so unfair.
Sort of, because...
Maybe you should find yourself
another woman. What is wrong with me?
You shouldn't say that, honey. There's
nothing wrong with you. Nothing at all.
You heard the doctor. We have options:
in vitro fertilization, sex marathons.
Hey, it will be fine.
See you later? Will you be okay?
We all live in the same house.
Not Bob of course.
Then, on an afternoon of good sex...
- Shit. Fuck. The kids.
And with those words, it happened.
He said it when they were saying goodbye.
Yes, here.
Come on.
Yes, yes. Take it easy.
Barbara, please pick up the phone.
MADLY IN LOVE
From tonight on, he'll be here.
- Who, the plumber?
No, Bob.
From tonight on he'll be sleeping,
living, and writing...
Now what? We only used to do it
when no one was home.
Only then?
We'll want to do it all over the place,
and I come like a hurricane.
I hope Bob knows
what he's getting himself into.
Like a hurricane?
- Yes. Like a hurricane.
Why? How do you come?
- Just... normally.
Is Matthias any good?
- What's he got to do with it?
Matthias is fine.
And his forty million sperm cells, too.
Not every man with a guitar
knows how to play.
I hope Bob knows
what he's getting himself into.
Go.
- Yes.
Yes, yes.
- Go.
You're the most intelligent woman I've
ever met.
You understand everything I say.
Did you know my wife has never read
any of my poems? Not one.
Judith, I can't do it.
I can't live without Claire.
She...
She gives me structure.
Do you understand that?
She gives him structure.
No, not really.
I love you.
I love you with all my heart.
Can't everything just stay
the way it was?
It's been great these last two years.
Leave. Leave.
Judith.
Let me come back, please.
Mom?
- She gives him structure.
Am I just unlucky or am I really
such a sad, pathetic hopeless case?
Do you really want us to answer that?
She was my daughter,
now she's the opposition.
What did you expect from a guy
who gets turned on by an Alexandrine?
Before Bob, it was a painter
who couldn't find his subject.
And when he found it, it was stripes.
- Lines.
Stripes, lines. What do I care?
And then that incompetent actor
who was exploiting you.
I got a lot out of that relationship.
Yes, herpes.
That guy was a psycho.
At least he took out his teeth
before he went down on me.
Please, I didn't need to know that.
I do remember he communicated
with Vangelis through the radiator.
Mom and dad separated years ago.
But if mom is down...
dad comes to her rescue...
in his own way.
Before I was born,
dad was married to Marlies.
Little Michelle was their daughter.
And thus my half sister.
Marlies was my mom's best friend.
We all look happy, but we're not.
Marlies is terminally ill, and dad is
cheating on her with my mom.
Second act, two months later.
Marlies died, and dad is drinking.
Mom often took care of Michelle,
like she was doing now.
Dad is a wreck, and
can't look at Michelle without saying:
She's so much like Marlies.
Third act.
Dad feels incapable of raising Michelle.
He lets Michelle choose, and that's how
mom got to be Michelle's guardian.
Years later, dad has a serious
drinking problem and mom has an affair.
Dad did everything to win mom back.
- Bert, go to bed.
In his own way.
And he keeps trying.
What is it your dad always says,
a woman's will is God's will?
Maybe you're right.
I have a home, I have children.
I'm beautiful, successful,
Elysian.
What do I need a man for? Pleasure.
A friend, but I have you for that.
No, no, no. From now on I decide.
I decide
who,
what,
where,
when.
Who, what, where, and when? Oh no...
Anyway, mom didn't mope around,
and started dating again.
Well? Do I look like
you could fall in love with me?
Tell me more about Nico.
- He's funny, he's a widower, a teacher.
And it's Karel, Karel Hoste.
- What?
Karel Hoste? Mom, that's my teacher.
My history teacher is going to see
my mother naked. Help.
Eva.
I'm not sleeping with him.
- Good.
Do it next Tuesday, because
we have a quiz on Wednesday.
Would you sell your mother
for a good grade?
Who raised me again?
Is this too much? I don't want him
to think about sex right away.
He won't think about Magna Carta.
- You don't know Karel Hoste.
Okay. Any tips?
- Don't talk about yourself too much.
Don't talk at all.
I don't know what it is. I guess men
are intimidated by me being me.
You know?
- Yes.
Aperitif?
I don't normally drink,
but I guess one won't hurt.
Cheers.
The next day Karel Hoste didn't show,
and we had a gym class instead.
And then...
And then the unthinkable happened.
For the first time in my life,
I fell in love.
Come.
Dad, I have some good ideas for
the Geert Bultincks exhibit, I think.
Dad? Daddy.
Great, honey. Discuss it with Sven.
But I thought I was doing the exhibit.
- You can assist.
Assist? I thought I could do it?
- Sweetheart, I had to give it to Sven.
He's been working here for four years.
You've been here what? A month?
Everything Sven designs
is so not interesting.
You don't have enough experience yet.
It's a photo exhibit,
not the Hagia Sophia.
You don't pronounce the I. Phone call.
Vlemincks. Sure.
One moment, I'll have a look.
Now that I was in love, Bob's poems
came in handy after all. Although...
Were you here first, and I the egg?
Cheers.
Mom had a date with a guy named Marc,
who was a little clumsy.
I'm sorry. That was...
- It's okay.
It's the table, you see?
It's... Under here.
The leg. I'll go get someone.
Excuse me? Aren't you Judith Miller?
- Yes.
The Judith Miller, you're splendid.
I love women who have character.
They're rare, especially at your age.
There we are. It's...
It's taken care off.
Someone is coming over for the leg.
...has attracted 235,000 visitors.
This year, heritage day centered
around the theme fake.
Men, hopeless.
Theo Cremer, the successful director,
has won another award.
Despite his busy schedule,
he accepted the award personally.
Theo Cremer, he's perfect.
He's famous, charming, a great guy.
That's why so many women fall for him.
He's going to be my lover.
Mom!
Is he aware of that?
Details, honey.
Eddy, I'll do the Cremer movie.
Did you turn it down already?
Call him, now.
Who's the female lead in your movie?
- Judith Miller, your national star.
A talent with eyes
every man wants to drown in.
Judith...
Yes, cut. And clap.
Cut it with the fucking snow.
Good. Perfect.
Thanks.
Honey, it's a great design, but it's
not what Fred Jacobs asked for.
But maybe that's a good thing.
Just show it to him.
It's too extravagant.
- What do you mean?
I don't like having to be the one
who always argues with you, either.
But all your designs lack
a sense of moderation.
That's okay, I used to be like that.
Go on, work on your puzzle.
Bye, dear.
We're having dinner at our house
next week. Would you like to come?
Dinner, I...
- Nothing fancy.
Just a nice evening with friends,
and people from the industry.
We'll talk, eat,
and take off our clothes.
Can I confess something terrible?
- Please do.
I've seen Marieke Somer
at least twenty times.
- That is terrible indeed.
You were very young then, a Lolita,
but I knew it: she's a star.
And what a star you were.
The way you jumped into that fountain,
your dress clinging to your thighs.
I hope I'm not embarrassing you.
A little, but I'll live.
Go on with your compliments.
Theo, the set is ready.
- I'm coming.
That Theo thinks he still has a chance
with the young girls. But I let him.
It'll be my turn soon.
What's with you? You seem distracted.
What?
- A blocked Fallopian tube.
What is that?
- One Fallopian tube is blocked.
But the other is just fine. I wouldn't
worry about it. Just keep trying.
I can't get pregnant this month.
I'm ovulating on the wrong side.
At least it'll be a quiet month.
Do you only do it to get pregnant?
- Why else?
I mean sex... I don't know
what all the fuzz is about.
It's just something you do,
like eating, or flossing.
Flossing?
- Yes, flossing.
Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Let me.
Are you okay?
- Yes, thank you.
Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I'll get it.
Really annoying. It's so out in the open
here, so when it starts raining, it's...
like... See?
- Yes. What?
One time my saddle was torn,
and in no time the rain turned it
into the Apennine Mountains.
Sorry, I don't know
why I'm talking about my saddle.
No problem.
I've always thought bicycle saddles
should be used in conversation more often.
I'm Johan,
the substitute for Karel Hoste.
I see, right. Oh, dear.
You're going into the lion's den.
Yes. But I'll be fine.
Karel told me everything.
Although...
Of course, Michelle is working again.
- You scared me.
Smile. I'm looking for your aunt.
- She's at a parent-teacher conference.
This looks fantastic.
It's not finished yet. This goes here,
and this goes there.
You work too hard. You're 23,
you should party, drink, and have sex.
Trust me. Before you know it,
you're 24. Come on, go out.
One moment, sorry.
My pen.
Mom. Do I look like
you could fall in love with me?
You look fabulous.
- Good answer.
Now all I need
is secondary sex characteristics.
Yes, I'm sorry.
Why are you calling?
- I...
I was wondering if I could loan me
some money, like 10,000 euro?
10,000? What for?
I told you I'm working on a screenplay,
and I need time to work on that.
I feel this is something I have to do.
What happened to your inheritance?
- I invested it.
In a car, clothes, your daughters.
Besides, that was two years ago.
Are you telling me
you spent 300,000 euro
on a car, clothes and the girls?
Mom and dad always fight.
Time to intervene.
One can't shop like this.
Mom, it's just not ethical to leave
one of these dresses behind.
Miss, can I ask you something?
I have to be in room 1 A15 tomorrow.
That's a class room above the gym,
where the first year students are.
Can you turn off the lights?
- I'll make sure everything's off.
Or I will.
I'm sorry, but...
what was your name again?
Is someone waiting for you?
No. Well, not really, no.
Do you want to make love?
Now, here, on the floor.
I'm sorry, but...
I think we should, Barbara.
I think we should do it.
I think we have to.
The universe wants us to.
But, I have to go home.
I really have to go home.
And I have to turn off the lights.
- Yes.
Now I know what you were talking about.
- What?
Oh, my God. I thought
I was going to die. I couldn't breath.
It felt like falling through the earth,
and flying to heaven, at the same time.
My body was wide like an ocean,
never ending.
I thought I was going to faint.
So this is what an orgasm feels like.
The world was bathing
in a crystal blue light.
I didn't recognize my voice.
I called out, and it echoed
through the class room and the halls.
That's what people were talking about.
I thought it was overrated.
It's better than all the stories.
I want more, much more.
Did Matthias finally get it right?
I wasn't with Matthias.
I can still feel it.
Who were you with?
Johan.
Who is Johan?
My colleague.
Johan? My history teacher, again?
Oh man, I've got tragic genes.
Fuck. It was amazing.
Did you fake it all this time?
- No, I didn't fake it.
I felt something,
and I really thought that was it.
But it wasn't,
because this is the real thing.
Oh, dear. Now what?
Now what?
I have to end this. Poor Matthias.
No, this is wrong.
I have to end it.
Two days later, dad came to cook
because mom needed to go see Theo.
I gave my screenplay to Theo,
and he gave it to his wife.
She was a producer,
and wants to start working again.
And she's interested in producing it.
I suppose that's good news.
No, Bert. It's great news.
We just pitched a drama series
at the public broadcasting network.
It's about four Muslim terrorists
working on the ultimate bomb...
who fall under the spell of the foxtrot.
All people want right now is fiction.
A perfect time for your screenplay.
Are you making a movie, too?
- Yes.
She's incredible.
She can act, and write a screenplay.
She works like a dog.
Her script is hilarious.
- I'm glad to hear it.
To a nice evening, cheers.
Daddy...
Come.
- Is it my favourite son and daughter?
I'm your only son.
- That's what I want you to think.
Bed time. Tomorrow is Thursday,
and you know what that is.
Thursday...
- Spaghetti day.
Say bye to everyone.
- Sleep tight.
Say good night. Bye.
I wanted to show you this.
It's beautiful.
There weren't that many stars,
but my mother has
an overly romantic view on life.
Thank you.
It's amazing how perfect
your marriage is, and your wife.
With every breath she takes, I think
she's going to break out into a song.
I can't complain.
And I'm crazy about the kids.
But?
- No buts.
But we made the same mistake
most married couples make.
Which is?
- We got married.
You look like you have
passionate sex every day.
We do, on the Venus calendar.
Making love to you was better
than all these thing together:
Tiramisu,
cheesecake.
- Cheesecake?
The Beatles' White Album,
Woody Allen, Bach's cello suites.
I think about you day and night.
There he was, the man of my life.
You're Eva, right?
- Yes.
I was lost, and incredibly nervous.
How can you be romantic and play hard to
get while you have soup in your hands?
He was everything I wanted.
He took economics and math.
He was funny, he had nice teeth,
and his name was...
Louis.
This is special. It's a design from
one of our new, young architects.
But we'll get back to that.
That's Michelle, my daughter.
She's new here. I'll show you the rest.
That's good. Whose design is it?
- It's mine.
Impressive.
- Her talent just needs to mature a bit.
Are you coming?
Michelle, right?
- Yes.
There's a competition for
young designers. You should enter.
Excuse me, Frank, follow me.
Could you bring us coffee, Michelle?
Wow, nice place.
- Yes. I'm not going anywhere.
Regardless of my landlady
who looks like a raisin.
And that I have to live like a worm
to afford it.
Wait. I came to...
Have you listened to the Bach CD?
- No, I'm returning it.
Stop putting CDs in my box.
You have to listen to this Bach CD.
It's a matter of life and death.
Have a seat.
- No.
Just listen. After that you can tell me
you never want to see me again.
I have to go. I came here
because I want to end this. Johan!
My aunt was lying. He was all she
thought about. And when he asked...
Do you like cava?
She knew she had no choice
but to get out of there.
Yes.
Cava.
Yes, it's...
It is a beautiful piece, indeed.
Yes.
It's like every note
touches you.
I'm sorry. I don't know why I did that.
That was really the last time.
How did this one night stand
turn into an affair?
A partita from Bach,
and a bottle of cheap cava.
At the International Criminal Court the
trial against Barbara Miller started.
She spent all afternoon fooling around
with her colleague with the nice ass.
Professor, does this happen often?
When there is an irresistible urge
to have sex with a co-worker,
it can lead to psychosis,
and even schizophrenia.
I feel guilty enough already.
And then there's no remedy.
Only psychotherapy.
- Stop it.
Yes?
- Last night was
divine, hot, crazy,
fantastic, phenomenal.
I sincerely hope you are talking
about the part where you were awake.
How would you describe me? In one word.
What's that word again?
Naked.
- Seriously.
Well, you are...
Elysian?
And that means...
It means I'm going to kiss you
with my naked, Elysian body.
When will I see you again?
- I have some time.
In ten seconds on the bathroom floor.
I have to go home,
and think off plausible excuses.
See you on set tomorrow.
Your design won. Congratulations.
It will be on display for one year
at the court house.
But I guess you knew that.
- Yes.
I think you should come work for me,
and I won't take no for an answer.
But I'm already working for my dad.
And after that, I don't think
I want to work for anybody anymore.
Christmas break! Finally, I could try
out the tips my mom taught me.
But in my own way.
And it worked.
Then we went skating. But skating
like a klutz was really hard.
But it was heaven!
Does it have enough ornaments?
- I think so.
I like it a little plain.
- It's perfect.
Judith, I think I'm having an affaire.
I thought it was over.
Why didn't you tell?
I was afraid to.
How many times have you done it?
Not many.
Maybe four times.
Four times?
I don't know what to do. It's so unreal.
I feel really guilty.
But at the same time, I really enjoy it.
Poor Matthias.
Dad?
Dad?
What's that?
I quit.
What will you do without me? You can't
even use a knife and fork properly.
I still quit.
Fré.
I'm so sorry. I completely forgot.
I've waited for an hour and a half.
You didn't answer your phone.
I lost track of time.
I was working on that exhibition.
Why didn't you answer your phone?
- It was in another room. I'm sorry.
You have to understand.
I can't screw this up.
Do you know that feeling, like this is
your once in a lifetime opportunity?
You know?
It's like sex with you.
I knew this was the perfect moment
for my first kiss.
For a moment, Michelle wished
this was how it had ended.
But what really happened was...
Fré, I don't know.
Maybe we should split. I'm impossible,
and you're better off without me.
What?
Judith! I'm so happy you came to say
goodbye before going to Vlissingen.
I'm going crazy in there without you.
Come on. Come.
Mom left for Vlissingen
for some Dutch theatre production.
Modern theatre. The Women of Troy
at the beach of Vlissingen.
And then the Greeks
storm towards the Trojans.
Be careful.
- Wait.
Come on.
- We're not going to make it, Matthias.
Matthias,
I don't want to go to Vlissingen.
I don't know. I'm just so tired.
- I don't understand. You wanted to go.
I know, but I think I'm depressed
from all the baby stuff.
That's why you need to get away,
fresh air, walking on the beach. Come.
But it will be cold,
and you know I can't stand the cold.
On the beach, the wind always hurts
my ears, and I get a runny nose.
I think I could use
a weekend by myself. It's just...
I really feel like I need to get
myself together again. Matthias.
do not board
Barbara
Barbara, come.
Please, come.
I thought you got on already.
Please, stay. Don't go. We'd have
a couple of days to ourselves.
I can't get out of it.
- What did you say?
That I'm not feeling well,
and I don't want to whine.
Honey, it will be fine. I promise.
Come on. Let's go.
- I'm going to stay at home.
What are you on about?
- I think you should go. Really.
You shouldn't have to stay home
because of my psychotic behaviour.
What is with you?
I don't understand. Say something.
What has gotten into you lately?
Please. Get on. Barbara, come on.
What is with you?
hot sex with Johan 11:20
more hot sex 12:35
even more hot sex 13:45
I'm a bad person.
Oh, sweetheart. Everybody likes
to get laid once in a while.
My mother got a house at the sea.
So we spent a lot of time there
that winter.
And Matthias gave Barbara
the space she needed.
Morning.
- Hi.
Have the others left already?
- Yes.
Do you want to eat? The raisin buns are
like... carbonized or something.
What are your plans for the day?
- Walking a bit, getting lost. You?
I don't know.
I wanted to visit some art galleries.
Apparently they have them here too.
And go out for pancakes after that.
If you'd like to come, it's my treat.
I don't know. Fré wanted
to live together, but I didn't want to.
Why not?
- I don't know. It was too soon.
Too soon?
- What about you and Barbara?
I don't know. Lately it's almost
like I'm sharing the bed with Hitler.
That's mean.
What's that?
- I don't know.
It's mine. But you can have it.
It doesn't fit me anymore.
That's really pretty.
- Isn't it?
Is it for me?
- Yes.
A Christmas present. I probably
won't see you at Christmas, right?
We really have to stop doing this.
I'm going crazy.
I cry all the time,
and I feel miserable.
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I love Matthias.
And I love my uncle.
You have this clear-cut idea
of what life should be like.
But that's not how it works.
You meet someone, fall in love,
move in together, you grow apart.
And then you meet someone
phenomenal, irresistible, godlike,
an animal in bed.
That's life.
I had a great day, thanks to you.
I've wanted to tell you something
for a long time.
What? What is it?
It's nothing. It's stupid,
but kind of funny too.
I've been madly in love with you
for years.
Really. Until I was fifteen,
or something.
Why did I tell you that?
I don't understand. I never knew.
Nobody knew. I've never told anyone.
You're the only one who knows.
When I was eleven,
I wanted to marry you.
But you broke my heart.
- I never meant to do that.
I still had my looks then.
Now I look like that guy
from Buena Vista Social Club.
kiss
Fuck, no. It's Matthias. Oh, fuck.
Hello? Hi, honey.
You sound weird.
No. It's nothing. I'm...
It's nothing. I'm running,
on my way home.
I wanted to come to you,
because I missed you so.
I'm coming. I'm coming.
No, I'm not coming. I wanted to come.
- Come.
What was that?
- That's my lover.
Don't be ridiculous.
It's her lover.
I'll call you later. Bye.
This is so bad.
It's really bad.
Really bad.
I feel really guilty.
It should never have happened.
It happened for the wrong reasons.
You're having problems with Fré,
and me and Barbara are having troubles.
I think we both know
we should work on our relationships.
What do you think?
I don't know what got into me.
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm glad we got that out of the way.
Could you talk to her? I don't
understand why she quit just like that.
I've always treated her fairly,
just like everyone else.
I treated her just like everyone else.
That's the point. You should treat her
like she's your daughter.
The problem is that she can't let go
of the feeling that you gave her up.
I gave her up? It was
the right thing to do at the time.
Does she say that?
- No. She doesn't. But it's true.
Come.
I bend my old legs to the ground.
I hit the earth with both my hands.
The whole family came to the premiere.
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.
Thank you. Thanks.
Who's the slime ball?
- He's the director.
He wants me, but he knows
I've got a thing with Theo Cremer.
Could I take your picture?
- Sure.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Hi, mom. Congratulations.
Did you like it?
- Very much.
I'm sorry, honey,
I didn't recognize you.
Not the first time is it, dad?
Thank you.
What for?
- Just because. For being here.
Judith, a while ago, I was thinking.
- Yes?
And I think
I came up with a brilliant plan.
I was thinking we could go to Italy
with the whole family.
To Tuscany or Umbria.
I could rent a place with a pool.
The girls would love it,
the four of us together.
You cancel that foolish TV show.
You can write for two months, and
I'll do the cooking. What do you think?
What do you think?
I think... I think that's a great idea.
It's so not like you.
You've really changed.
You've gone from being a total pain...
To just a regular pain.
Am I hopeless?
No, you're not hopeless.
And I don't like to say it, but you're
a fantastic actress.
And more importantly,
a great mom. Thanks to you,
the girls have turned out great.
They're crazy about you.
It's Theo.
Don't answer.
Don't answer.
Hey.
Hey.
- Sorry to call so late.
How was the premiere?
Were you brilliant as always?
I don't have it under control.
Are you staying in Vlissingen or...?
- Why?
Ann took the kids to her parents, so...
maybe a glass of champagne,
a bite to eat...
watch the stars.
Just a second.
- That moment dad had had enough.
You got lucky. I was about to dump you.
I finally got some time alone
with Louis. Zoe was on a skiing trip.
She was really starting to bug me.
She stuck to us like glue.
Anyway, the movie was bad. We were
talking the whole time, and then...
No, move down a little. Yes, that's it.
Awaiting my first kiss,
I practiced on Rimbaud.
Wait. Where are we?
We're going up some stairs.
Take a step. One, two, three.
Come on. What's this? It feels funny.
Take it off.
- Yes?
This proves it. You've gone crazy.
What is this?
It's called a house. Way too expensive,
but perfect. It's up to you.
You're crazy.
- Yes, I am. Come on.
You've got to be kidding.
- Look here.
Isn't it great?
- My goodness.
Look at this.
We can't afford this.
- We'll rent out the upstairs.
Come look at the fire place.
And look, another fire place.
It's ours.
- My, goodness. You're really crazy.
There's more. Come on.
- What do you mean there's more?
All that's missing now
are Gladys Knight and The Pips.
I don't know how to start, so...
I'll just say it.
If we'd just...
If you don't walk away now, and say yes,
then this might be what the next
fifty years of our life look like.
Wait.
Will you marry me?
Yes, I will.
Johan, what are you doing?
Don't you get it?
You're so cold all of a sudden.
I miss you.
Why don't you answer when I call?
- Because it's over.
What else is there to say?
- Barbara.
Hello.
Judith, what are you doing here?
- Surprise.
No, listen. I don't have time.
But this setting asks for romance.
Theo, sweetie. Here I am.
Your wife doesn't suspect anything.
She's busy downstairs.
Hello. Champagne?
All seemed well between Barbara
and Matthias. They set a date.
What's this?
- A present.
Bach?
- Yes, tickets to the famous German.
I thought you'd like it.
It's all you listen to lately.
Hey, are you okay? You look like
you were hit by a jet plane.
Just in time.
- Yes.
What was it?
- Nothing, a colleague.
Okay.
Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.
It was brilliant.
- Yes, but I'm feeling off.
Do you want to go outside?
- Yes.
Who's that?
A substitute teacher
who was teaching at our school.
I'm going to say hi. I'll be right back.
Mom was depressed,
and kept thinking about the same man.
You were right about Theo.
I fell for it again. I'm such an ass.
My life is a disaster.
What are you doing here?
Who's she?
- None of your business.
Why haven't you told me about her?
- Do you really care?
Why are you so angry?
- Because I'm sick of it.
What?
- Your moods.
I'm sick of being the one you lean on,
of being the cash machine.
Who took care of the kids all those
years? Not you. You were drinking.
Sorry, I didn't mean that.
But can't you delay the anger and
give me some attention and some wine?
Why don't you go to Theo's for that?
- I don't understand.
Take a good look at yourself.
- Don't.
As if you're not an emotional wreck.
Michelle is unhappy because of you.
I'll make sure I won't ruin your life,
or our daughters' anymore. Now leave.
Dad, please.
What are you doing here?
- I'm visiting my dad.
Michelle and I were talking
about her future.
Don't you dare. We're done talking.
Leave, please.
From now on, we'll e-mail about Eva.
Do you really mean that?
- Yes, I do.
At some point it's just over.
Dad.
Come on, Judith.
Damn. Screw this.
Better. Now you've really captured
the tragedy of the scene.
The fatality of the main character,
who refuses to see life for what it is,
and keeps chasing
unrealistic illusions.
Soon the wedding was off,
and the house was up for sale again.
This is crazy.
I'm so mad.
I'm having sick thoughts.
- Like what?
Like what? Renting a van,
and crushing Barbara and her Johan.
But I can't because I haven't
got a driver's license.
Matthias, come here.
Michelle, it's all just too much.
I'm very grateful
for everything you've done.
But I want to be alone.
You should go. I'm sorry.
That's clear.
- No, Michelle. Don't go. Come.
No. It's done.
- Michelle.
I'm pregnant.
Pregnant? That's fantastic. Great.
Three months already.
Three months? Were we back together
three months ago?
No, it's Matthias'.
Matthias? That's crazy.
How is that possible?
Now what?
I don't know.
- Neither do I, baby.
It's not really a good way
to start a relationship, is it?
Okay. This discussion is over.
- No, it's not.
We'll figure it out, we'll compromise.
- How, we'll get a guinea pig?
Michelle?
- Barbara.
Who is it?
Can I come in?
- Yes, of course.
I don't know.
I really don't know. Tristan.
- What's wrong with Tristan?
I've got it.
Ringo.
Veto.
- Yeah, veto.
Thanks a lot.
- You should support him.
You're the love of his life.
- I have to draw a line somewhere.
a happy face lights every place
who, what, when, where
I'm not in. Leave a message,
and I'll call you back.
Bert. Please, pick up.
I just wanted to say
that villa in Tuscany with you cooking
is not such a bad idea.
Bert, please.
I slept with my mom every night
to comfort her.
And Michelle was working, and working,
and working for the exhibition,
and then, eight months later...
Honey, this is great. It's incredible.
Come on, let's go.
Michelle! So glad to see you.
Let me introduce you to the mayor.
- A pleasure.
I want to introduce you to someone.
Daddy.
- Hey, honey.
I'm so glad you're here.
Mom is so boring lately.
No car crashes, no lovers,
and socially acceptable behaviour.
I didn't know it was that bad.
- Come.
Congratulations. It's beautiful.
You can't not look at it.
Hi, Judith.
Bert.
I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, no.
I'm glad you're here.
- Me, too.
Do you want something to drink?
- Yes, please.
Don't worry. I'm fine now.
I won't strip and sing...
what's her name?
Dolly Parton.
- Sing a Dolly Parton medley.
Not before midnight, anyway.
Congratulations on the movie.
- Thank you.
We start shooting soon.
- I heard. Great.
I've written at least 500 versions.
How about you? How's your love life?
Now that Michelle is my boss, I have
more time, so I should work on that.
Actually, there is someone.
But you know me, always apprehensive.
We'll see if it works out.
The ball is in her court.
- Look, daddy. This is Tristan.
He's lovely. Congratulations.
- Thank you.
How is it again? I lost track.
Your former brother-in-law
will be my brother-in-law.
And I'm also my nephew's aunt.
And Matthias will be
mom's and your son-in-law.
It's not that complicated.
And you used to be my boss,
and now I'm yours.
And I'm yours.
Dad stayed for a long time.
This is really a sad scene.
I should get going.
I have a busy day tomorrow.
Okay. Bye.
- Bye.
Right. I should go.
Okay, bye.
Can I see you again sometime soon?
I mean I...
I mean I would like to see you again.
Tomorrow when I pick up Eva, right?
Yes. No. I mean...
Come on, mom. Just say it.
If you need to borrow money,
you know you always can.
Come on, mom.
It's not about money,
That's not why I'm here.
What is it, then?
I wanted to tell you that I...
I love dad.
Mom,just say it.
Say I love you.
Take care.
You're a strange creature.
I try.
Take care.
Bert...
Ever since we split, I've been
wandering about aimlessly.
I love you.

By the way, this is Lucas,
my first real boyfriend.
It didn't work out with Louis.
I changed my life completely
and I think I found my destiny.
And cut. Very good. Fantastic.
