Look! It's Turbo Man and Booster!
Kill them both!
Turbo discs, anyone?
- Stop him!
- Go, go, Demon Team!
- No! Help, Turbo Man! Help!
- I'm coming, Billy!
Ta-ta, Turbo Man.
Five seconds to ignition.
It's turbo time!
Got you.
You haven't seen
the last of me, Turbo Man!
I'll have my revenge!
Here you go, Mr. President.
Mom, Dad, Booster.
- Thank you, Turbo Man.
- You can always count on me.
Hey, Jamie, why don't you go upstairs and
change, hon? It's almost time to leave.
But Dad's not home yet.
Now he's probably gonna
miss me get my belt.
He misses everything.
Well, he's not gonna miss this.
He's probably just working really hard.

Hello, Mr. Jacobs.
Oh, yes, we've been busy,
but, you know, I like that.
I'm gonna make it.
I hear you.
Yes. So what
can I do for you?
200 king-sized by next Friday?
No problem whatsoever,
but only for you, Mr. Jacobs...
because you're
our number one customer.
Andrea, hi.
Well, if you think the fabric is too dark,
then we'll just recover it.
And no extra charge
- Well, what do you expect?
- You're my number one customer.
Don't you forget.
You're my number one customer.
You're my number one customer.
Liz. Hi, honey. How are you?
Howard, where are you?
I know— Jamie's karate class.
Don't worry.
I'll meet you there. I promise.
And don't forget,
you're my number one customer.
Liz! I— Look, I didn't mean that...
Liz?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it.
He's not gonna make it.
What the...
Johnny!
- The kids look great, don't they?
- Yeah, they do.
Ted, I baked you some cookies...
- You know, to thank you for fixing my screen door.
- Yes, sir!
Well, thanks, Judy.
- One!
- One!
Ted, I was wondering
if you’d mind...
taking a look at my porch light.
It just doesn't
seem to be working...
and you being such a handyman...
Sure. I've got just
the tool for the job.
I'm gonna make it.
Damn it.
- Hai!
- Two!
- Hai!
- Three!
- Four!
- Hai!
License and registration,
please.
Look, sir,
I'm in kind of a hurry.
I'm really late for
my son's karate class.
Oh, I do apologize
if I've caused you some sort of delay.
How thoughtless of me.
Because the last thing that I want
on my conscience right now...
is for a private citizen to
somehow be disappointed...
in the performance of my duty.
Look, I was not criticizing you, Officer.
It’s just that-
Step out of the vehicle.
That's my boy!
There. Are we finished now?
Recite the alphabet.
"A," "B," "C"...
Backwards.
Way to go, Jamie!
I didn't make it.
Hey, neighbor!
Ted? What the hell are
you doing on my roof?
What's Ted doing on your roof? Ta-da!
I had some extra lights
in the garage...
and since you didn't put up any yourself,
I thought, what the heck?
Why not spread a little Christmas cheer
around the neighborhood?
Aw, gee, Ted, how thoughtful.
Hey, sorry you missed
the karate class today.
But don't worry.
I got it all on video for you.
What would I do without you?
Did you tell Ted that he could
put lights up on our house?
Howard, do you have
any idea what time it is?
I know. You should have seen the traffic, and
on top of that, I got a speeding ticket.
Don't explain it to me.
It wasn't my karate class you missed.
We'll be back right after these messages
- Hi, buddy.
- It's turbo time!
Now it's your chance to save
the universe with Turbo Man!
Battle evil with America's
favorite superhero...
and his sidekick Booster.
Jamie, about
that karate class tonight...
I was trying to—Jamie.
Jamie, stop!
Listen.
It was not my fault.
Jamie, don't walk away
from your father.
Jamie.
Can I come in?
So, champ...
are those hands registered weapons yet?
Oh, is this it?
Wow! This is really cool.
How do you do this?
Like this?
No. I know. Like this.
What do you think, Jamie?
How about this?
Ya!
I've done something
really stupid today, huh?
- I don't care.
- Oh, come on, Jamie.
I hope this is not true, because I really
wanted to be there.
Look, believe me, I...
But you always say that,
and you never come anyways.
Purple was important to me, Dad.
That's one away from green
and three away from black.
- But I saw you get yellow.
- But you missed blue.
You're right.
I really blew it.
I'm really, really sorry.
You think you can let me
make it up to you?
Like how?
Well, like letting me
do something special... just for you.
Like, if there’s something
really important...
you've been wanting
for Christmas, hmm?
Ah, don't worry.
I got it covered. I wrote Santa.
Ah. But Santa gets very busy
this time of the year.
Sometimes he even has to ask moms
and dads to help out a little bit.
Nah. It's not that important.
Tell me.
What do you want?
I want the Turbo Man action figure
with the arms and legs that move...
and the boomerang shooter
and the rock-and-roar jet pack...
and the realistic voice activator
that says five different phrases...
including, "It's turbo time!"
Accessories sold separately.
Batteries not included.
Well, I'm glad you had to stop
and think about it.
Johnny's gonna get one,
and so is everybody else I know.
Whoever doesn't is
gonna be a real loser.
Well, that definitely won't be you.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you.
I love you too, Jamie.
I love you!
Whoa!
Liz, you should have seen us in there
I mean, we were really bonding
We were drawing.
We were laughing, having a great time,
talking about that Turbo guy.
Turbo Man. Which reminds me—
You got the doll, right?
The doll?
Yeah.
That Turbo Man doll.
I asked you to
pick one up two weeks ago.
Oh.
That doll.
Of course.
Howard, you didn't. Please tell me
that you did not forget that doll.
No, no. I-I— I got it.
I— I got the Turbo Man doll, the one that
has those things that shoot out in front...
with that rock 'em
sock 'em jet pack...
and with that realistic voice box
that says, "It's turbo time."
- I got it.
- Oh, good.
There you are. I mean,
you thought for a minute...
that I would not do something
that you tell me?
I got it right away.
Good.
Because at this point...
they'd probably be
impossible to find.

Howard, it's Christmas eve.
You can't be going
to the office.
I have to pick up the D-O-L-L.
I left it there by mistake
Oh. Okay.
- All right.
- Bye.
Dad, you can't go to work today.
What about the parade?
- The parade?
- The Holiday Wintertainment Parade.
We go every year.
- Oh.
- Well, you didn't go last year or the year before.
But Mom and I always go. Anyway,
this year Turbo Man's gonna be there
- Yeah. Turbo Man.
- Turbo Man. Yes! It's turbo time.
Dad, you can't miss it.
It's gonna be really cool.
I won't miss it.
I'll be there.
I promise.
Whoa!
Whoa!
- Sorry about that, Howie.
- What's that— a reindeer?
A little Christmas surprise for Johnny.
You just think of everything,
don't you, Ted?
Howard, I'm of the mind-set
you can never do too much...
to make a child's Christmas magical.
So what happens to
Blitzen after Christmas?
I've been watching a family of deer
down by Lake Minnetonka.
I thought I'd take him
down there and set him free
If nature's kind, they'll take him
in like he's one of their own.
How touching.
Hey, buddy. How are you?
- Hey!
- Whoa! That's odd.
Reindeer are usually
such gentle animals.
There must be something about you
he doesn't like— aftershave or something.
Yeah.
All right. Got to go.
Where you off to so early?
Picking up a Christmas present
for Jamie.
Whoa! Nothing like waiting till
the last minute, Howitzer.
- So, what'd you get him?
- One of those Turbo Mans.
Oh. That's great.
I got a Turbo Man
for Johnny months ago.
It's nestled safely under our tree.
Good.
Howard, by the way,
they say it may get icy later.
You might want to wrap some chains
around those tires.
Maybe I should wrap
some chains around you.

All these important Christmas letters
that people send to folks...
they don't even talk to
but once a year...
not to mention relatives sending presents
they're going to have to send back anyway.
How many toiletry kits
does a man need?
And how about those little, stupid letters
from kids to Santa at the North Pole?
"Dear Santa,
could you send me a bike and a Slinky?"
No! Your father's been laid off!
And as if I didn't have
enough pressure in my life..
My son sends me out
for some goofy-butt toy...
some fruity robot
named Turtle Man.
That's Turbo Man.
My son wants one too.
You know it's all a ploy,
don't you?
- A ploy?
- Man, where have you been?
Don't you watch TV? We are being
set up by rich and powerful toy cartels.
Oh, come on.
You got these big fat cats sit there using
working class just like me and you.
They spend billions of dollars
on TV advertisement...
and then they sit there and use subliminal
messages to suck your children's minds out!
I know what I'm talking about because
I went to junior college for a semester..
And I studied psychology,
so I'm right in there.
I know what's going on. Then they sit there
and make a kid feel like garbage...
because you, the father,
who's working 24-7...
delivering mail so you can make
an alimony payment...
to a woman that slept with everybody
at the post office but me...
and then when you get the toy, it breaks, and
you can't fix it because it's cheap plastic!
Know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to walk up in that office...
grab one of those guys and just choke him,
choke him until an eye pops out!
What's the matter with you?
You shouldn't wear fur.
Back off. I'm first.
Turbo Man, you're mine!
- Move it, move it, move it!
- Whoa!
Get out my way!
Get out my way!
Booster?
Who wants Booster?
The Turbo Man dolls,
they're all gone!
- There's got to be another one here somewhere.
- There are none here!
- Excuse me. I'm trying to find a Turbo Man doll.
- Yes?
- Me too.
- Do you have any more in the back?
- What?
- What's he laughing about?
- What did I say?
- These guys are looking for Turbo Man.
A Turbo Man doll, yes.
They're looking for Turbo Man.
Hey, everybody.
These two are looking for a Turbo Man
Shut up, man.
Now what's so funny?
Where have you guys been?
Turbo Man's only the hottest selling
Christmas toy ever. Duh!
But you know what? We got plenty of Turbo
Man's faithful saber-tooth tiger Booster.
Where's your Christmas spirit?
That's better.
Now, there must be a Turbo Man
around here somewhere.
Uh, duh— The last one just left.
- Um, some lady had it on layaway.
- A lady? What lady?
- Uh, uh, sh-short, uh, with a fur coat.
- Fur coat.
Sorry, buddy.
- Give me this.
- Hey!
This is war.
Whoo!
Yeah!
Cool.
- Oh, poor baby.
- Turbo Man.
Ah!
- Excuse me, lady.
- What! What do you want?
I'm not a robber. I followed you
all the way from the store.
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.
- There's something I wanted to ask you.
- Would you like my phone number?
Oh, no. I mean, no.
It's, uh, I would like your bag.
- My bag?
- Yes. I'll offer you twice what you paid for it.
- Twice?
- Okay, three times.
- Three times.
- Oh, I get it.
Oh, sure. What the heck. For that
kind of profit, knock yourself out.

Hey, hey, hey.
Cut it out.
- Hi, Liz.
- Oh, hi, Ted.
Look at you.
It's Christmas eve,
and you're slaving over a hot stove.
- Is this the mom of the year or what?
- It's no big deal.
And modest too.
Liz, looks like you could
use a little you time.
Why don't you go upstairs,
take a shower?
I'll keep an eye on the boys,
finish up with the cookies.
- Oh, no—
- Da-da-da. Go on.
- You deserve it.
- Uh...
Oh. Well, o-okay,
but listen for the oven timer-
I know. Sugar cookies.
- Bake 12-15 minutes till golden brown.
- Yeah.
Ted's got everything
under control.
Oh!
Pipe down in there!
Merry Christmas. Langston residence.
Hi, I— Ted?
Howard! Hey, buddy.
How's it going out there?
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, fine. Ted, I need to speak to Liz.
Could you get...
Howard, excuse me, but your wife's cookies
are out of this world.
What— Who told you
you could eat my cookies?
I'm just helping Liz out a little in the
kitchen. She's baking up a storm here.
Ted, I need to
speak to my wife...
so could you get her
on the phone, please?
I think she's in the shower.
Do you want me to go check?
No!
I mean, no, that's fine.
On your way out, just tell her
I will be a few minutes late...
but she shouldn't worry.
Oh, she won't worry.
I mean, I'm here, and...
Mmm! Oh, these cookies!
I got to get the recipe from Liz.
Put that cookie down!
Now!
Howard, is there
something bothering you?
Because this time of year, there's a very
high incidence of stress-related breakdown.
Oops! There's the next batch.
Gotta go, Howard.
- I'll give Liz your message though. Bye-bye.
- Yeah, but...
Hey, hey, hey, look who it is!
- Still on the hunt, huh?
- Yeah.
Hey, sorry about whacking you
at the toy store.
I got caught up in the friendly spirit
of competition.
That's all right.
Don't worry.
But I was thinkin',
you'd have done the same thing.
That's when I realized—you and I,
we're the same kind of person.
I sort of doubt that.
I was thinking
about that brouhaha at the toy store...
I was thinking we could
join up as a team...

like Jonny Quest and Hadji, man...
like Bonnie and Clyde
like Ike and Tina...
Not Ike and Tina, because she left,
but we could do it!
Search and destroy. Divide and conquer.
Me and you. What do you say?
Thanks, Myron,
but, no, thank you.
Come on, man.
Let's do it. Let's be a team!
Gee, Myron, I think
you're a good guy and all...

like to do by myself.

- Jamie, how are you doing, old buddy?
Hi, Dad!
I knew you'd call!
Hey, listen,
let me talk to your mother.
- You can't.
- Why not?
She's next door petting Ted.
- She's what?
- Listen, Dad, are you on your way?
The parade's gonna start soon.
Jamie, get your mother, please.
- Well, are you?
- Am I what?
- Coming home soon.
- Yes, immediately! Now please get your mother!
'Cause, Dad, before you left...
you promised that you were
gonna be at the parade.
You haven't been here all day,
so you can't miss it.
Jamie, please.
'Cause, Dad, when someone makes
a promise, they definitely should keep it.
You know, it's like
what Turbo Man says:
"Always keep your promises
if you want to keep your friends."
Enough! Enough of
this Turbo Man, okay?
I had it up to here
with this Turbo Man!
If there’s anyone I don't want to have
advice from right now, it's Turbo Man!
Now get your mother!
I'm sorry, Jamie.
Look, I didn't mean...
What would you know about keeping your
promises? You never keep your promises!
You never do anything
you say you're gonna do!
Ever!
Damn you, Howard.
Here you go, my man.
This will warm you up.
- Thanks.
- Cheers
You?
Peace!
'Tis the season to be jolly.
Yeah.
Any luck in finding that doll?
- No.
- Me neither.
Maybe this will help.
Oh, yeah.
So I couldn't find
the kid a doll.
- Does that make me a bad father? No.
- Nah.
But yelling at him
for no good reason?
Now, that makes me a bad father.
Look, we get one chance a year to prove
we're not screwups.
And what do we do?
We screw it up.
I remember a few years ago..
I wanted to do something really
special for Jamie.
So, I built him
his own clubhouse.
It came out great.
Oh, it— Well, I mean, the door
was a little crooked, right?
And the roof didn't
sit quite straight...
but you should have
seen his face light up.
Oh, when he saw that,
he was so excited.
We played in that clubhouse
the entire day.
- He even made us have Christmas dinner in it.
- No!
Oh, yeah.
I was the hero then.
Look at me now.
You're right. That kid's gonna need
some serious therapy, man.
- Oh, don't say that.
- Mm-hmm.
I know what I'm talking about.
See, I never forgave my father.
I remember one Christmas,
I wanted this one special toy-
a Johnny Seven O.M.A. gun.
- You remember those, don't you?
- No.
I still remember the commercial
like it was yesterday.
Two kids playing
out in the backyard.
"Johnny to Peter. Johnny to Peter.
Enemy sighted."
"Roger there!
Open fire!"
And then Johnny would whip out his
Johnny Seven O.M.A. one-man-army gun.
Seven guns in one— count 'em!
One— it's a grenade launcher.
Two— it's an anti-armor gun.
Three— it's an antitank gun.
I see ya, buddy.
Four— it's a rifle.
Five— it was a tommy gun.
Six-it's an anti-aircraft gun.
Just in case somebody survived,
seven was a cap-firing pistol.
Thing looked like a blast.
But— Of course,
for my old man...
Christmas was just
another opportunity to let me down.
I never did get
that Johnny Seven O.M.A
Sorry to hear that
Hey, don't mean nothin'.
You ever heard of a guy
named Scott Sherman?
Yeah. C.E.O.
of Sherman Industries.
He was my old neighbor...
and his dad got him
a Johnny Seven O.M.A. gun.
You know what happened?
He became a billionaire.
And me? Well...
I'm just a loser with no future.
Here's to you, Dad.
I can't let this happen
It’s just a doll.
It’s just a stupid little plastic doll!
Uh-uh-uh.
That's "action figure."
There's got to be one
around here somewhere!
You say you've been looking
everywhere for a Turbo Man doll?
Yes.
You say you'd do just about anything
to get your hands on one?
- Yes, yes.
- Well, KQRS has good news for you.
If you’re the first caller to correctly
identify all eight of Santa's reindeer...
you will be the winner of the hottest toy
since Johnny Seven O.M.A.
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. All right.
It's easy.
Just call 555-KQRS
- No!
- I don't think so, buddy!

Nope, not even close. Sorry

- What?
- You see, I couldn't get through on the phone.
- Did I win?
- Oh, no, it's not that simple!
- No, it's-Wait, wait, wait!
- You're too late!
I've already got the right answer!
I won! Yeah!
I don't need the right answer
to win! I got this!
- And what's that?
- This, Mr. Track Star,
is a homemade explosive device!
- A bomb?
- Good Lordy!
Yes, in layman's terms-a bomb!
So back up!
- You built a bomb?
- I didn't have to build a bomb.
Don't you read the news?
Hundreds of these things come
through the mail every day.
I just kept one
in case I ever needed it.
So give me the doll, or I'm gonna
blow up everybody in this place!
Are you out of your mind?
Put this thing away! This is not worth it!
Maybe not to you, but to me it is.
So back up!
Myron!
Come on, old buddy.
Give me the package, all right?
Come on.
- Did you call me buddy?
- Yeah.
I am not your buddy! I tried to be your
teammate! I wanted to be your friend!
- But no! You had other plans for Myron Larabee!
- No, I had no plans.
You were no different than
the rest of those civilians...
those common letter writers who make fun of
my kneesocks and my safari hat in the summer!
Are you laughing at me?
- Huh?
- Oh, no! Lord, no. No, not at all.
Mr. Ponytail Man, I know you!
I know your kind!
You're the kind that puts
the trash can in front of the mailbox...
so I have to get out
of my Jeep, don't you?
- No, not true! I recycle!
- Shut up!
That's right! Shut up!
Why do you think the window's there?
So I can just put the mail in there!
But you act like everything's okay!
"Hey, Mr. Mailman!"
Like I have no feelings of my own!

Then do tell me what it is

you got Jamie his own

What it looks like is that you've broken
into our neighbor's house...
and you're stealing presents
from under the tree.
Liz, if you just give me a second,
I could explain it to you.
I know parts of this are going
to sound completely ridiculous...
but let me tell you the truth
Howard, I've been listening to your version
of the truth for far too long now...

I don't want to anymore.
All I want is to salvage
what's left of Christmas eve...
and go to the parade

There are lots of women who would give

months ago...
at your Labor Day barbecue,
remember?
And you asked me how
to marinate ahi tuna...
and I said, "All you need
is Italian salad dressing."
You!
Come here.
Stop that man!
Enough talking.
Ow!

go as well as I'd hoped.

Okay. Okay, listen up.
We're running late here, so pay attention.

the instruction manual we sent you...
so you know all about
all the important controls.
- Let me just go over a couple of the changes.
- What changes?
There are three cutoff valves
to the nitro fuel.
- What are you talk-
- Here, here and here
The normal reading on the pressure gauge
should read anywhere below 50.
- But I—
- Not 70 like we told you earlier.
- The emergency cutoff switch is here.
- But you don't understand.
The primary controls are
gonna be right here
And there's also a microphone
inside the helmet...
that will alter your voice
to the proper tonality.
- Procedure-wise-same as we
talked about over the phone.
- Procedure?
- Stick to that, there shouldn't
be any problems. Questions?
- Yes.
Before you say anything, let me just take
a moment and speak for everyone...
when I thank you for filling in

What's the matter, Jame?
It’s just-I wish that Dad
could have been here, you know?
To see me fly and all.
But he didn't come
and it's all my fault.
He's mad at me.
We had a fight on the phone...
and I kind of yelled at him.
Jamie, your dad

And as for you, Turbo Man...
we could use
a man like you on the force.
Thanks.
I'll keep that in mind
Oh, I'm sorry about the bike...
and the coffee...
and the bus..

Hey, thank— thank you.
Thank you.
You know, this is gonna
make my son really happy.
I'm sorry about that, uh,
little tension we had on the roof.
Hey, it's cool.
But, Jamie, I thought you wanted
this doll more than anything.
What do I need the doll for?
I got the real Turbo Man at home.
- Oh!
- Turbo Man!
That-That's my husband.
Turbo Man! Turbo Man!
That's my dad!
That's my dad!
- Hey!
- Yeah, look at that. There it is.
- Voilà!
- Beautiful.
- Perfecto!

Howard, I've been thinking.
Everything that you
went through today for Jamie...
really shows
how much you love him.
And, uh— And if you’re willing to go
through all of that for him...
just for a present...
well, that makes me wonder.
