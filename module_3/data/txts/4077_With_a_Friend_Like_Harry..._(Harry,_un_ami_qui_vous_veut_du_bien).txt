Wait.
I'm hot.
I know, Sarah.
I'm really hot.
Isn't she thirsty?
She just had a drink.
Jeanne, stop kicking.
Stop it, please!
I want to see
Granny and Grandpa.
We'll see them soon, sweetie.
Can't you feed her?
She's not hungry, she's hot.
Stop it! It's very annoying!
My seat belt hurts!
Is it too tight?
Then say so.
Don't kick the seat!
It's too tight!
Jeanne!
Stop it, Jeanne.
Stop it!
Sarah, please! Don't interfere.
WITH A FRIEND LIKE HARRY
-She has diarrhea?
-Her bottom's all sore.
Poor baby.
Pass the ointment.
Hands out of there! It's dirty!
I'll tell my folks
we're not coming.
What? Not stop to see them?
No, it's too late.
The girIs are pooped.
I don't mind, but they will.
We'll go in a few days.
So far again, so soon? No way!
What do you suggest?
Go now, get it overwith.
No, we'd interrupt their nap.
They'd be grumpy.
We'll go when it's cooler.
Here, I'll take a leak
and call them.
We know each other.
I don't think so.
We do.
Michel Pape, right?
Harold Ballestero.
Harry.
Berthollet '79.
Berthollet '79?
You don't remember me?
I don't think so. Sorry.
Harry Ballestero,
Berthollet '79.
We collided playing handball.
I lost a tooth.
Remember now?
Frankly, no. Sorry.
I often don't recognize people.
No problem.
So what are you up to?
Taking my girlfriend
to SwitzerIand.
Show her the Matterhorn!
How about you? On vacation?
Yes, with my famlly.
Got kids?
Three girls.
Great.
Do you still write?
Do I what?
You wrote. I remember a piece
in the school magazine.
That? No, not for ages!
So what do you do?
Teach French to Japanese
in Paris.
Evening classes?
No, actually. Daytime.
-Funny, us meeting like this!
-Right!
Got to go. My wife's waiting.
We have a long drive.
Yes, of course.
I'm glad to have met you again.
Me,too.
See you around.
I just met a classmate
from twenty years ago.
Did you talk?
A bit. He came up to me.
I'd never have recognized him.
Daddy!
I want to go on the swings!
Your sisters are tired.
There are swings at the house.
I want to go on those ones!
Get in the car and be good.
Stop it, Jeanne! Please!
Do as your mother says!
Why can't I pIay now?
Because we're leaving.
Get in.
The car is an oven!
This is Harry.
We went to school together.
Claire.
Harry Ballestero.
Plum, my girlfriend.
Jeanne, Sarah, and Iris.
It's a shame to just shake hands
in the toilet.
Have dinner with us.
Be my guests.
The kids make it difficult.
We don't want to be late.
That's a pity.
Could we come to your place
for a drink?
It's the wrong way
for Switzerland!
No probIem.
It's miles out of your way.
We're as free as the wind.
But we'd hate to impose.
Not a bit. We'd love it.
Claire. Would you mind?
No, but he's right.
It's a long way.
Who cares?
It's such a pleasure for me!
-Dad, can we have some chips?
-Later!
Want a lolly?
Are they allowed?
Want a lolly, girls?
So, do we follow you?
You'd better.
The roads get narrow.
Hard to find.
-The girls look hot.
-They are.
No air-conditioning?
They could come with me.
It's better with air-con.
No, they'd be confused.
OK. Lead on.
My lolly.
What about it?
It fell on the floor!
Filthy! I'm throwing it away.
My lolly!
It's no big deaI.
I want another lolly!
I want another lolly!
Twenty degrees.
That's more like it.
His motto is:
"Solve every problem."
What do you do, may I ask?
I used to be a spoiled brat.
I sponged off my father...
much against his will.
Since he died,
I've handled his money.
It leaves me time
to take it easy.
Nice life!
You could say that.
Right, baby?
I adore you.
Come on, kids.
Come on in.
Been coming here long?
We bought it five years ago.
You come every summer?
Yes. We're trying to fix it up.
All by yourselves?
As much as we can.
Takes time, of course.
Sorry, got to call my folks.
Hi, Dad. We just got in.
Sorry we couldn't make it.
Did you wait up?
Sorry. I tried to call.
Couldn't find a pay phone.
How about next week?
Damn, I forgot.
When are you leaving?
No, I understand.
OK, we'll do that.
Lots of Iove, and to Ma.
I'll tell them.
See you in two days.
Their place, day after tomorrow.
OK?
Do I have a choice?
After that,they'll be away.
I forgot.
They twisted my arm.
Is your dad stilI practicing?
He's retired. Do you know him?
He fitted my bridge.
Really?
Wouldn't it be easier
if they came here?
Dad can't drive far.
It's his heart. Doctor's orders.
They used to come
and meddle a lot...
because they
helped us buy it.
It's better this way, isn't it?
Yes, dear.
Where's your sister?
I don't know.
I think she's upstairs.
Don't play with the water!
Come and Iook.
Stupid idiots!
What the fuck have they done?
It was a nice idea to surprise
us. That's not the point, Dad.
It's exactIy why
I'm doing it all myself!
I'm not blaming you!
I just think you should
have asked us first.
I'm sorry...but pink!
Fuchsia, whatever!
It must have cost millions
to send your plumber here.
I know, I know.
OK, he did a good job.
Listen, Dad...
Me,too, and love to Ma.
I'll tell them.
Day after tomorrow,yes.
I ran into Boussac once.
Remember Boussac?
I remember.
He looked a mess.
This was seven years ago.
He had a big dog.
Half German shepherd,
half Labrador.
A bitch. He called her Silmey.
I asked him,
"How's life? Not too good?"
He said, "My wife left me
six months ago."
He'd married a Greek-born
Italian woman...
named Melysa.
They lived in Cyprus for
two years,then she dumped him.
"Is that why you call
your dog Silmey?" I asked.
"How do you mean?"
He hadn't even noticed
it was an anagram of Melysa.
It was brilliant!
He hadn't even noticed.
He was aIways yelling at it.
"Silmey! Come here! Shut up!"
It was hllarious.
He was amazed when I told him.
Then he laughed and said...
"At least this bitch obeys
when I say, 'Bed!"
I shouldn't really laugh.
Remember Adele Cauchy,
the redhead?
I remember her.
You dated her, right?
Not for Iong.
Me,too, after you. She was
always talking about you.
Really?
Take it from me.
She said you gave her
her first orgasm.
She was a pain,
always telling me...
how intelligent
and sensitive you were.
I got quite jealous.
What a mixed-up kid!
The only girI I ever dated
who was hornier than me!
She wore me out!
With Plum, I've finally found
the perfect balance.
Right, baby?
Dick and I are in harmony.
We're perfect bedmates.
It's pure pleasure.
"Dick"?
I call him Dick.
I don't llke Harry or Harold...
or his middle name, Richard...
so I call him Dick for short,
like in English.
Adele Cauchy, by the way,
introduced me to your poem.
Your poem?
His poem.
You wrote poetry?
You don't know his poem?
No. Tell me more!
I wrote a poem
for the school magazine.
"The Dagger
in the Skin of Night."
In what?
"The Dagger
in the Skin of Night."
Want to hear it?
You know it by heart?
I remember it well.
For me, it's a classic.
"Slowly, he moved forward...
"with his dagger
in the skin of night...
"taking, taking all his time...
"with his dagger
in the skin of plight.
"He sniffed the breeze...
"with his big grin
of overnight...
"smiling with all his teeth.
"Slowly, he moved forward...
"taking,taking all his time.
"From his side,
shot out a blade of steel...
"with his dagger
in its skin of steel.
"Then he started time to kill.
"On the breeze, he feIt a chill.
"On his skin, he felt a thrill.
"He was naked as an eel...
"with his blade
in skin of steel...
"with his big knife
of the night...
"unsure what to do or feel.
"Like ice,
he melted out of sight."
How did you learn it?
Isn't it beautifuI?
Not bad.
Don't you like it?
Not bad. It's funny.
Funny?
"The dagger in its skin
of night." It's a bit...
A bit what?
Odd.
I think it's powerful.
You didn't know he wrote it?
How come you know it by heart?
I read it so often, it sank in.
Plum loves it,too.
Dick often recites it to me.
You never write now?
No,thank God!
That's a real shame.
I wish I had your talent.
I remember "Flying Monkeys."
You can't possibly!
-Can you recite it?
-It's too long.
It's a novel.
Hardly! It was the opening
chapter of a sci-fi story.
I gave up after...
three or four pages?
It was more than just sci-fi.
Was it in the school mag?
What was it about?
This guy...
who stuck propellers
on monkeys' heads, right?
First, he makes them do chores.
Then he uses them
to spy on people.
They were gibbons.
What?
The monkeys were gibbons.
How do you remember?
It's one of the most beautiful
things I've ever read.
No kidding.
Look! He's blushing with pride.
-No, I'm not.
-You are!
Claire,
you're my kind of people.
That's nice.
To friendship...
and Flying Monkeys.
I warn you, it's basic.
Perfect.
I put out some towels.
Luxury!
You'll need this.
Excuse me, I'm off to bed.
-Thanks for having us.
-You're weIcome. Good night.
Claire's nice.
I could have done worse.
lf I can help you guys,
just say.
Thanks.
I really mean it.
I believe you.
Financial help, for instance.
Thanks. Very kind of you.
I have a steady income.
We're fine. No need to pity us.
I didn't mean it like that.
I just want to help.
Money's no object for me.
Sorry, I'm tired. I need sleep.
The girls wake up early.
Good night.
Thanks for everything.
See you tomorrow.
Slowly, he moved forward...
with his dagger
in the skin of his dick...
OK, OK.
Was that how you
made Adele come?
Absolutely.
Why did you never tell me?
About Adele Cauchy?
No, your poems.
They're old. Teenage stuff.
Fuck!
Can't she sleep?
She's got a temperature.
Do you need anything?
I came down for an egg.
I noticed there were some.
They say you should eat a raw
egg yolk after each orgasm.
Does wonders for virility.
It does?
I've stuck to it for two years.
It seems to work.
Mind if I take one?
Help yourself.
I'll put her to bed.
How do you llke Plum?
She seems very nice.
She's not brainy
like Claire, but...
She has an animal intelligence
that I like a lot.
Know what I mean?
Well, back to bed. Good night.
Why did you stop writing?
Search me.
It was never a priority.
Where are you going?
Stay away from the hoIe!
Go back there,where it's safe.
Good girIs!
Morning!
What are you doing?
Filling in an old well.
Why bother?
Claire's scared for the kids.
I keep promising to do it.
Is it deep?
Twelve, fifteen feet.
Hell of a job!
You shouId rent an excavator.
It's less work.
I like the exercise.
You'll wear yourself out.
-Where's Claire?
-Out shopping.
And taking Iris to the doctor.
She was feverish all night.
I hardly slept.
Didn't you hear?
No. Nothing at all.
We slept like logs.
Plum's still asleep.
She's a big sleeper.
Did you try with the choke off?
Off, I said!
Off! Off!
Do I have to spell it?
I'm not patronizing you.
Sorry, I misunderstood.
Sarah! You need heIp?
Where are you?
Don't move. I'm coming.
-What's up?
-It won't start.
Iris' ears are infected.
She needs antibiotics.
Again! Fuck.
It's the starter.
I'll call the garage.
Take the kids back with Harry.
I haven't done my shopping.
Do it this afternoon.
I'm not coming back into town.
Once is enough.
Take the girls. I can manage.
On foot?
I'm not a moron!
There are taxis.
Don't snap at me.
I didn't say you were a moron.
Stand back.
I could come back and pick you
up and be here in one hour.
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.
Been waiting long?
Only afew minutes.
Are you and Michel happy?
Right now,we're neither happy,
nor unhappy. We're exhausted.
How come? You're on vacation.
It's all too much.
We bought this house to relax
in, but the work never ends.
We can't get it finished.
We're exhausted.
So we argue.
It rubs off on the kids...
so we get upset more.
There must be solutions.
We tried leaving the girls
with Michel's parents...
to give us a break.
It didn't heIp.
That's a lousy solution.
It's not what I call a solution.
True.
Wrong way.
I know. I have an errand to do.
-It's a V6?
-That's right.
Is this the only coIor?
We can order other colors.
Nope. I need it now.
Would Michel llke this red?
Do you like it?
How come?
We're not buying a car.
I am buying it for you.
You're joking.
Don't even consider it. No way.
I don't see why.
Because!
Is it out of proportion?
Right. It's out of proportion.
Listen.
I think every problem
needs a solution.
A spacious air-conditioned car
is a first solution.
Plenty of room for kids
and parents...
The first step to a more
relaxed atmosphere. True?
That's not the point. You can't.
I certainly can.
It seems huge to you, but
relativeIy, it's nothing to me.
People don't give
and receive cars like that!
It's no use arguing.
You don't like 4x4s?
Let's go.
My frozen food is melting.
They're useful in winter.
Doesn't MicheI like 4x4s?
He hates them.
He thinks they're vulgar.
Like it?
Your new car.
It's your new car!
Whose joke is this?
Not mine.
I tried to dissuade him.
It isn't a joke.
-Is Plum up?
-She's in the shower.
It's a joy to drive.
Even nicer than I thought.
Where's the catch?
No catch.
I felt like buying you a car.
What for?
To replace your old one.
Claire said you don't like 4x4s.
You'll soon get over that.
You've got to be joking.
You know what these things cost?
It's grotesque.
I don'twant it.
You think it's vulgar?
That's not the point,
but yes, I do.
It's not vulgar.
It's a family car.
-Why did you let him?
-I didn't!
Look, baby!
Michel and Claire's new car.
Cool!
-You accepted it?
-What could I do?
-Refuse it!
-I did. Don't blame me!
Take it back if you want!
But our car's fucked.
Just the starter!
It'll be fixed in three days.
Why complicate life?
It's simple.
I wanted to give you a present.
Snap! It's yours.
What's wrong?
One less hassle to handle.
I'd rather handle my hassles
my way.
It's your father.
If you go tomorrow,
count me out! And the girls!
Iris is sick.
Hi, Dad.
Nothing's the matter.
We can't come. Iris has an
earache. She's on antibiotics.
She shouldn't travel.
You'll be gone, I know.
We'll make it another time.
Don't even think about it!
You're not to drive!
Short distances, he said.
This is far.
Of course you're entitled
to see your grand daughters!
It's too far!
Almost two hours' drive.
It is too far!
No, Dad. Don't come!
They're descending on us?
Great.
It's me again.
I'll pick you up tomorrow.
Don't argue. I'll be there at
10:00 and drive you home after.
See you tomorrow.
Wimp!
-I try to do what's best.
-You do it badly!
Thanks.
Are you OK?
What are you doing?
My little ritual.
Darkness enhances the senses.
Sorry.
You try too hard
to satisfy everyone.
What?
Don't you think we have to
choose at some point?
Why ask me?
I've seen you in action.
Keeping everyone happy.
Juggling with Claire
and your parents...
humoring everyone.
For nothing.
I don't juggIe. I live
with Claire, not my parents.
Isn't it time
you toId your parents...
to stay out of your life?
That sounds a bit drastic.
It depends on the parents.
Mine aren't that awful.
They're a moderate pain.
I have nothing against them.
We all have things
against our parents.
OK, but there are limits.
On the contrary.
We have to exaggerate.
Excess is the only way
to blossom.
What are you doing tomorrow?
We'll find a hotel nearby
for afew days.
SIeep here.
My parents won't sleep here.
I don't want to impose.
Plum wouId like to have a pool.
I'm going to bed.
You're staying here?
All night in the kitchen?
Possibly.
Come in.
Good shape?
Hi, Ma.
Ready to go?
Have some coffee first.
It's ready.
I saw you drive up.
You bought a 4x4?
A friend lent it to me.
What's wrong with your car?
It's having the starter fixed.
Who's the friend?
An old classmate.
From schooI, here?
What's his name?
Harold Ballestero.
The boy who bit your skull?
Your memory's better than mine.
No sugar.
How couId I forget?
I replaced his tooth with
the new ceramic alloy. Good job!
WilI he be there today?
We'll see him.
I doubt he'll stay for lunch.
You needn't have come.
I could easily drive.
You bet.
Did Claire not want to come?
No, it's because Iris
has an earache.
Why wouldn't CIaire
want to come?
Ask yourself.
Maybe if you
kept your hands off her...
How are your teeth?
Great.
Let's have a look.
Don't bother, Dad.
Silly to waste the opportunity.
Go on. Don't spoil his fun.
Everything OK with Claire?
She sounded tense
on the phone yesterday.
You're lucky to have her.
She's a good woman.
I don't blame her
for avoiding that hog!
Sorry.
So you're both OK?
-We're fine.
-Want me to speak to her?
No, everything's fine!
I'm thirty-four, Dad!
Hello, sweetie.
Here.
Hello, darling.
How are you?
Fine.
You get prettier every day.
You're Harold.
I recognized you at once.
Let's kiss.
No need to be formal.
I'm old but young at heart.
Finished flirting?
My wife is very jealous.
How's your bridge?
Fine.
StllI the same one?
No. I had it changed in America.
Was there a probIem?
It was going black.
How odd.
Never heard of that!
So the 4x4 is yours?
It's Claire and Michel's.
He said you lent it to him.
It's under negotiation.
Most buyers of 4x4s
don't use them off-road.
They just like to know
they couId.
Potential freedom
is what they want.
-Isn't it funny?
-Hilarious.
I gave up trying
to amuse you long ago.
See how she nags me?
Save it.
Michel knows the score.
Excuse me. I feeI sick.
Take it easy.
You saw them!
"Nothing against them," he says!
"They're moderate pains!"
Calm down, Dick.
Shall I go on?
That's fine.
Thanks, baby.
I'm glad you're here.
Claire? This is Harry.
Sorry we left in such a rush.
We're at the Mont Royal.
Nice place. Very comfortable.
Have they left?
When will Michel be back?
Don't bother.
We'll be turning in early.
I'll phone you tomorrow.
Good night, you,too.
We'll talk tomorrow.
-Come in for a minute.
-No, I'd rather get back.
-Not even for coffee?
-No,thanks.
I've lost the keys.
Here they are. I'm going senile.
-Sure you won't come up?
-I'll be off.
-Drive safely.
-Don't worry, I'll go slowly.
Safe journey!
Good night.
Who is it?
Harry Ballestero.
What's up?
We have to talk.
At this time?
Come on up. Third floor.
What's the matter?
Michel's in trouble.
You'd better come with me.
What kind of trouble?
If you want to help him,
follow me in your car.
What's it all about?
I can't say any more.
He'll explain better than me.
Did he send you?
If you've got my son
into anything shady...
I'll make you regret it!
If you want to help him,
come with me.
Didn't he have a different car?
It's odd to have so many cars.
Don't you think?
OK? Not too tired?
Don't worry!
Isn't he driving too fast?
Flash your lights.
I can easily keep up.
See! You've lost him.
I haven't!
He was down that path!
Don't be silly!
He was down that path!
Why would he do that
if we're following him?
No idea.
It's him.
What do you mean?
I was right!
He was down that path!
What's he doing? He's crazy!
-Stop!
-I can't. He's pushing me!
Stop!
Iris seems better.
Yes. She cried last night,
but it was a nightmare.
Nightmares at her age?
-They're starting.
-Poor thing.
Have you tried homeopathy
for earaches?
I don't believe in it
as a cure.
But as a protection?
I don't want to give them
even more medicine.
Not even homeopathic.
If you did,
they'd need less medicine.
What's she on? Antibiotics?
They're hard on a baby.
I know.
Something wrong?
My parents are dead.
Killed in a car crash.
They can't be. When?
Last night, on the ridge road.
Their car was found in a ravine.
They missed a bend.
What took them up there?
God knows.
I have to go there.
I'll come with you.
We can't take the kids.
Stay here.
I won't let you go alone.
Stay here. I'll be OK.
I can drive you.
Plum can stay here
and help with the kids.
Good idea. Let's do it.
Will you have them
buried or cremated?
Cremated.
You're right. It's better.
Are you OK?
My teeth hurt.
It's stupid. Psychosomatic.
Want me to get a dentist?
No,thanks. I'll be OK.
I'm going to bed.
You haven't eaten.
Shall I order something? Pizza?
No,thanks. I'm not hungry.
"The Flying Monkeys"
Hi, Claire.
Better not wake him.
He went to bed early.
OK. He seems to be
taking it well.
It's a hell of a shock.
I'll put him on.
Sorry,
I thought you were asleep.
You couldn't have known.
It's me. How are you?
Just about.
I was in my room, not sleeping.
OK?
Yes. It was good to talk.
Good.
You got the old magazines.
Just flicking through them.
And?
It feels weird.
You should finish "The Monkeys."
It would do you good.
Especially now. It's the time.
You have to press on.
After my father died,
I fucked like a rabbit.
I was full of positive energy!
It's odd. PeopIe get scared
when their parents die.
You know why?
They realize
they're next in line.
It brings
their own death closer.
On me,
it had the opposite effect.
I felt much better.
Know what I mean?
You're saying I'm lucky?
Use it as a springboard!
A golden opportunity!
I could pay you to write.
You think I care about that now?
You should.
You're talking nonsense.
I'm going to bed. So should you.
Get out of my room.
Hi.
I'm Mr. and Mrs. Pape's son.
Harold Ballestero.
I'm a friend of Michel's.
Had me worried! I thought
you were an undertaker.
Sorry,
I'm going through a bad time.
Weren't you at Berthollet?
Isn't Michel here?
I think he's in the shower.
I didn't leave you fifty
messages. Just five or six!
Twelve? Big fucking deal!
I can't help wanting to see you!
We spent two whole months
together!
I know. You told me before.
Yeah? OK.
So now we know!
Right. Good-bye.
Cunt!
I'm wiped out.
The train was too hot.
They heat trains in midsummer!
Stupid bastards.
You saw them? Where are they?
A funeral home in the sticks.
Jesus.
They wanted to die.
What?
It was suicide.
Why do you say that?
I don't know. A feeling.
They wanted to die.
The cops say they skidded.
It's my fault. I should have
called them more often.
Claire toId me
all about her child births.
She says peridurals are great.
No pain,
but you feel everything.
Having Jeanne was
the happiest moment of her life.
When they lay the baby on your
breast, it feels incredible!
I don't want children.
I know.
What's bothering you?
Nothing.
I hope I haven't blown it.
When can we go
to the Matterhorn?
Soon.
Can'twe go now?
I can't desert Michel.
"The Flying Monkeys"
continued
Would you mind? The girls
want Plum to come back with us.
Could you take Eric instead?
Back to your place?
He's staying afew days.
No, I don't mind.
Thanks. They'll be so happy.
They love PIum.
That feels better!
Are you staying long
at Michel's?
Till they go home.
I'll help on the house.
Did he ask you to?
No, but he needs help,
and I need the exercise.
I didn't say it in front of him,
but back there...
in the crematorium,
seeing the coffins...
I suddenly felt so good!
Isn't that weird?
Know what I mean?
I was really down. You saw me.
Now I'm up. I feel light.
I haven't felt so good in years.
-Want a laugh?
-That depends.
Look what I found
at my parents' place.
Recognize it?
The Berthollet magazine.
They printed a poem by Michel.
He won't remember it.
It was in a box in his room.
It's fucking hilarious.
I'll read it out loud at dinner.
He won't know what hit him!
Guess the title.
"The Dagger
in the Skin of Night"!
Listen. You've never
heard anything so lame!
I don't want to hear it.
You will. Listen.
"Dagger in the Skin of Night."
"Slowly he moved forward...
"with his dagger
in the skin of night...
"taking, taking all his time...
"with his dagger
in the skin of plight!
"Smiling with all his teeth...
"slowly, he moved forward!
"From his side,
shot out a blade of steel...
"with his dagger
in its skin of steel.
"Then he started time to kill.
He felt a chill.
"He was...
He was naked as an eel!"
What's up?
Flat tire, I think.
You're alone? Where's Eric?
He thumbed a ride.
He what?
We were taIking about you.
He got angry.
Said you were repressed.
He blew his top, made me stop
the car and got out to hitch.
Said he was going home. He's
sick to death of his family.
God, he's at it again!
Call him.
He'll be sorry already.
You call him.
He'll listen to you.
What's his number?
It's in the book.
Not his mobile number.
Right. I've got it.
Mobile?
It's his voice mall.
Eric,this is Claire.
Harry told us what happened.
I hope you're OK.
Call us back. Lots of love.
I'm wiped out. We're off.
Coming, baby?
What are you doing?
Aren't you asleep?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
You're writing again?
No.
It's on your mind, I can tell.
What's that supposed to mean?
I found a page marked
"Flying Monkeys."
So what?
Are you writing the rest?
I'm not writing anything.
I see.
Get out, please.
-Get out.
-What's wrong with you?
Open up!
Have you gone crazy?
Open up!
What's going on?
Fuck! How can I get anywhere
with you squealing at me?
Send them up.
Did we get you up?
Not at all.
They wanted to see the castle.
Impressive!
Where's Plum?
Sleeping. Don't disturb her.
We want to see her.
Harry said no.
Don't you want to draw?
No. We want to see Plum.
You've seen the pretty castle,
now draw. Plum's asleep.
Would you have some paper?
And a pen?
Do some pretty drawings.
Sit down.
Michel's in a state.
It's not only
his parents' death.
He's very distraught.
How do you mean?
I think you're
a bad influence on him.
Me?
What went on
at his parents' place?
Nothing special.
Nothing unusual happened?
He's strangely tense.
He shut himself
in the bathroom to write.
I've never seen him so hyped up.
Is that true?
He's writing again?
He's gone back
to "The Flying Monkeys."
That's great. Excellent.
You put him up to it?
What if I did?
What do you want from him?
Nothing.
I just want to heIp him.
Why?
Why?
Because I believe in him.
That bothers you?
The change in him bothers me.
It's naturaI.
He's at boiling point.
We're touching vital issues.
Close to the bones.
I don't understand.
He's spreading his wings.
This pen stopped working.
Did you break it?
Don't worry about it.
Time to go, girls.
My drawing's not finished.
You'll finish it at home.
Stay away from the house.
It's best if you
don't see Michel.
I'm sorry you think so.
Come along.
What are you looking at?
The girls came to visit.
They're going?
You should have woken me.
Stop squabbling! That's enough!
Stop it, Jeanne!
I had it first!
Stop it! For heaven's sake!
I'm confiscating the boat.
No more boat!
I'll take over.
Where were you?
Working. Getting some air.
I need some air,too.
The girls
want to say good night.
Claire, I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.
Flying Monkeys on the brain?
It's absurd. Where did I get
such a stupid idea?
You want to write, keep going.
It's not such a bad idea.
It is. It's absurd.
Did you know they were coming?
Surprise visit.
We brought some champagne.
These are for the girls.
I just put them to bed.
I wanted to give them a hug!
Can't I see them?
We'll kiss them good night
together.
Claire came by this afternoon.
She did?
She's worried.
She thinks you're distraught.
She said that?
She's probabIy right.
She said you're working
on "The Monkeys."
Good.
Getting anywhere?
I'm not surprised.
You know why?
Claire.
She saps your confidence.
Remember what she said
about your poem?
"It's funny." It came back to me
just now. Funny!
Funny!
It's not funny!
Claire can be funny if she
wants. "The Dagger" isn't funny.
You're talking crap.
-Your life is crap!
-I do what I want.
You do what Claire wants.
She won't Iet you
fulfill yourself. It shows.
She weighs you down.
She wastes your life!
You're too close to her
to see straight.
Your kids are the same.
They stop you thinking.
Shut up.
At first, I thought you needed
a better famlly life.
Now I see that's bullshit.
The rot lies deeper.
You're trying to write again.
Good.
But until you get your shit
together, you'll never make it!
Claire and the kids are
like leeches. Cut them off.
Enough! Shut up!
Do I tell you to dump Plum...
because she's
a pea-brained cow...
who stunts your mental growth?
It's none of my business!
You think Plum's a cow?
No.
Yes.
You said it.
I didn't mean it.
It was an example.
Delicious!
I didn't know zucchini
could be so good.
-I wish I couId cook.
-Just do it.
No, I don't have any talent.
Even with a cookbook,
I'm hopeless!
You know what Michel
thinks of you?
You're a pea-brained cow.
Why did you say that?
He said it.
You bastard.
-Did you say that?
-I said nothing.
I'm sorry.
Harry got me angry.
I shot my mouth off.
I really didn't mean it.
I know I'm superficial.
Absolutely not.
I think you're gorgeous.
I wish I was a normal person.
Take it easy.
I want to lie down.
Can I sIeep here?
Yes, of course.
We're all cracking up.
It's OK.
You all right?
Where's Harry?
He left.
I'm going to bed.
You'll be OK?
-What's going on?
-I don't know.
You don't?
"THE EGGS"
What are you doing?
Looking for something.
Since when?
I didn't hear your car.
I crashed it. I walked.
Were you hurt?
You're writing?
What? "Flying Monkeys"?
What?
Something more personal.
Good.
Very good.
Where are you going?
To get Plum.
She's asleep. Don't disturb her.
Let her sleep.
She's tired! Leave her alone!
Avoids a mess.
You're right.
She was a deadweight.
Move over.
Move over, please.
Help me.
Help, or we'll wake everybody.
Come on!
I can't sleep.
Go to bed, darling.
Stay here, OK?
Here's your bottle.
Don't move. Promise?
Stay in your room.
Was it Sarah?
Was that Sarah calling?
You put her to bed?
Here.
Deal with Claire.
I'll do the kids.
Get a move on!
What's the matter?
You want me to do it all?
OK. Wait here.
Get out of the way.
Why did you do that?
It hurts.
What are you doing?
What's going on?
I couldn't sleep.
I was wide awake,
so I filled in the well.
In the night?
I preferred to keep busy
than fidget around.
Has Plum left?
Harry came for her.
They've gone.
Did they say anything?
They give you their love...
and say thanks.
Is everything OK?
No, everything's fine.
You should go to bed.
Get some sleep.
You're right.
Let's surprise him.
We went out to pick flowers
for you.
Darlings, how sweet.
Thank you, angel.
Go on, now! Let Daddy wake up.
I couldn't help reading
"The Eggs."
It's brilliant.
You think so?
Really. You should go on.
Any idea where
the guest room pillow is?
I gave it to Plum
to sleep in the car.
Good idea.
Sorry I've been so crabby.
That's OK.
I love you.
Me, too.
Come on the swing with me!
-Who's winning?
-Me!
