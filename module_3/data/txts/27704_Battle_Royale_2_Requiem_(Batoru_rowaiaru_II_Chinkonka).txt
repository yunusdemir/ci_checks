Battle Royale II
Requiem
On Christmas day
The world shook...
Since Noriko and I escaped
from that island
3 years have passed.
The number of victims of BR-Act (Millennium
Educational Reform Act) had been increased.
Once our ball is rolling and we get others involved,
it was impossible for anyone to stop the momentum.
The phalanx of skyscrapers
slowly collapses into rubble...
We live in a world where the very word
terror seems as if it was meant for this age.
Nanahara Shuya is wanted internationally,
as the leader of the Wild Seven Organization,
engaged in anti-government terrorist activities.
In the name of "Justice",
adults started a new game.
"New Century Terrorist Counter-Measure Alternative"
program, a.k.a. the BR II act.
The dice are thrown.
We will never forgive adults
who made us kill each other.
Let's stand together!
And fight together!
We now, against all adults,
declare war.
Battle Royale II
Requiem
3 years ago, my father, who
was a high school teacher,
was shot to death by his own student.
In the center of the picture
my father completed,
had a drawing of a girl.
When I found out
 that it wasn't me,
I stopped attending school.
And now...
To confront my feelings
about my father,
I've decided to join the Game.
Wanted for Murder and Accessory:
Nanahara Shuya, Nakagawa Noriko

Shikano-Toride Junior High School,
which I enrolled in,
where all students are
required to live on campus,
was built to accommodate losers and
juvenile delinquents from across Japan.
All students had been
written off by adults.
Uncool!
None of us had any future.
What's Real or True in Life was
pain I could feel here.
Stupid!
Friends - Shintaro
Your turn, Taku
Not me
Why not?
Sign it, you graduated.
Nothing's finished yet
Hey, Hey!
Shintaro!
Hey!
Neck Collar?
Where are we?!
What the hell is going on?!
To you, 10,000,000 supporters
of the BR Act.
Look!
Under extreme tight security,
the bus has just arrived.
This time, Class 3-B
at Shikano-Toride Junior High
has been chosen.
Look! You can see the students!
Camera! Zoom in!
Zoom in!
Take a good look!
These are specially selected
bunches of losers.
Under the revised BR rules
they're the first students to play.
As the whole world watches,
What battles can we expect this time?
Thanks to our sponsors,
They're getting combat uniforms
and watches.
Imagine the stirring sight of
42 youthful, passionate deaths!
Be Seated!
Be seated!
Be seated!
Sensei!
Sensei!
Sensei!
Sensei
All yours, sir
Merry Christmas!
I'm Takeuchi Riki,
in charge of your class.
By the way,
I'm sure you guys do recognize
what's happening?
We're clueless!
You've gotta explain!
This necklace hurts, Sensei!
Japan
China,
North Korea
What's that shit!
Guatemala
Load of crap!
Let's split
Indonesia
Time to go
Move!
Out of the way!
Cuba
Congo
Peru
Laos
Vietnam
Cambodia
Grenada
Libya
El Salvador
Nicaragua
Panama
Iran
Iraq
Somalia
Bosnia
Sudan
Yugoslavia
and...
Afghanistan
Do you know what these
countries all have in common?
In the past 60 years,
America has bombed
every one of them.
22 nations in total!
Death toll is a
minimum of 8 million!
All lives are equal?
What a lie!
All lives are no longer equal!
Since that disastrous act
of terrorism last Christmas
It's been one year now.
The terrorists who destroyed
so many lives in an instant
have barricaded themselves
on Senkan-Jima Island.
Terrorist leader,
Nanahara Shuya said
in his Notification for Terrorism,
We Declare War
Against All Adults!
Go right ahead!
By the way, in this county,
Adult is defined as
You must be
at least 20 years of age.
Anyone else is a child!
To raise a child to adulthood,
how much money is needed!
Have you ever thought about it?!
Huh!
Who the hell...
Who the hell are you !
Who the hell are you !!
Save your weapons for later.
Huh!
Somewhere between 30,000,000
and 40,000,000 yen per average!
That's what your lives
are worth right now
This impoverished country
can no longer afford
to support expensive
worthless kids like you!
So the adults discussed it
with the big shots
and decided to reject
his declaration of war
If you want to have war,
fight among yourselves!
Sorry to have kept you waiting!
BR II !!
Today you guys go to war
Not so fast
BR II is a whole new war game,
based on the BR Act,
With simple rules
Track down and kill the evil leader,
Nanahara Shuya and you win!
You've got 3 days to complete
this game or you die.
Got that?
No way!
See that white line on the floor?
In real life, there are only two sides,
The Winners and The Losers.
Anyone who crosses that line...
has the guts to be the winner.
If you wanna play,
go to the right.
If you don't wanna play,
go to the left.
The losers are bad.
This is the line that divides
good from evil.
It's black or white.
There's nothing in between.
I'll call your names
in School Attendance Order.

There are 3 attack points.
The island's divided
into several zones.
Every hour there will be
a new danger zone.
You should leave the zone
before it gets activated
or your explosive necklace
will blow automatically.
We're releasing the boats
from auto control.
Prepare to land

Get some rest, Taku.
Hey
 Hey!
Shut up!
Aren't you pissed?
They murdered
all of them!
Of course,
I'm furious.
I can't believe I'm here
fighting like this.
I'm pathetic.
What's up Kuze?
What is that?
Insulin.
Funny, isn't it?
I inheritated
from parents...
I can't live without it.
But I've only got
3 days worth.
I never dreamed
we'd wind up here.
Your first smoke?
We have
so many things
we've never learned
and never tried.
What are we doing here
fighting a war?
Hey! Hey!
Hosaka.
Over here, here.
Look what's that?
What happened?
Don't move.
It's a trip mine.
It's Jyo and the rest of Squad 2!
Jyo! Nanami!
You OK?
Risa, What'll I do?
I'm scared!
Don't worry.
I won't leave you.
Stay away from me!
You crazy?!
I'm sick of this!
Totally sick
of this shit!
Don't move!
Shit! Hold on.
Jyo! We're coming!

I won't let you.
And let friends die?
We get Nanahara first.
I won't let you die

We lost our whole family

How the hell
would you guys know
What it's like
to lose your family!
Their bodies

My Dad, my Mom, my sister
Blown into bits and pieces!
Fuck your terrorism!
Fuck your war!
I'll never forgive you

Day Two
12/24 0:40AM
Nanahara Shuya?
What are you going to do with us?
Wanna finish off the game?
Fine with me
That's enough!
You, come here.
Sit!
Don't move.
It'll blow
Answer me!
What do you want with us?
Dressed up like this,
What did you come
this island for?
You call that fighting?
Get to your fucking point.
You know the name
of this weapon?
The AK-47
AUTOMAT KALASHNIKOV
The international symbol of
guerilla resistance.
3 years ago, I survived a former
game, with another girl.
We got out of this country
and went to the country with ongoing
guerilla war for 20 some years.
The border are overflowing
with 4 million refugees...
With harsh inflation...
Ruins remain from the bombing...
The conditions of life there was
far worse than my expectations.
But even under those
hellish conditions,
their smiles were
always those of pride
The open smiles
of the children...
So what?
What the hell's that
got to do with us?
What are you fighting for now?
Listen, you kill me
and this game's over.
But would your struggle end?
Can you forget all this
and resume your old lives?
Then what are you fighting for?
They all died because of you!
We'll keep on fighting,
Even if we have to fight
every last adult in the world.
Until the day
that we can smile
like the open smile
of the children we once saw.
Shuya, Special Forces,
approaching our perimeter!
Here we go!
Back to our hideout.
All of us here either survived
a game or lost family
We're not your enemies
We're going.
You, too.
Wait, Jin
Hey!
Taku!
You kids stay back!
Hide!
I didn't have a clue
what the hell your point was.
How does it feel?
To murder others,
to survive yourself.
How do you feel?
You just aim the gun
and shoot!
This is what it takes
to survive.
Hey! Hey!!
Yuuma!
Yuuma!
Yuuma!
Down!
HQ! This is Mamiya!
The students have gone
over to the terrorists.
We're being slaughtered!
Send reinforcements!
Send reinforcements!
Now!
Sensei!
Sensei?
Shit!
You're just
a bunch of brats!
Shit, you got me!
I have..
a family, too..
Day 3
12/25
The rain kept falling
Nozomi..
Hang on Nozomi, Nozomi!
With only the moans
of the dying,
echoing heavily
in our minds...
Nozomi!
Sagisawa!
Sagisawa!!
I'm sorry!
I... I...
Survive...
All of you...
Survive...
Don't forget...
...about me
Don't for...get..
Nozomi! Nozomi!!
Sagisawa!
Girls #06, SAGISAWA Nozomi
Dead (10 To Go)
We lost another friend.
Now what are we
supposed to do?
Answer me!
There is no answer.
You've got to search for one
Taku!
We never had anywhere
we could go.
I knew that all along.
Or any place
to go home to!
This is war, right?
You're all fighting
for your lives
But die, and you're just
one more candle
Even those poor little kids
You're all the same.
You're no better
than the adults
How I wish this war
would end...
I keep on asking myself...
How can I answer
all those who have died?
I don't know.
But inevitably, we all
grow up to be adults
The best we survivors can do
is to keep remembering
the ones who died.
Always and forever,
even after we grow up
Hello?
Hello...
Hello!
What are you doing?
I told you to knock.
You stink.
Don't come in here.
Listen, today's
your birthday, right?
Thought you and Mum
and I could go out
You're the worst!
What?
My birthday was yesterday.
It's today?
It was yesterday.
Just get out.
Listen Shiori.
Still got more to say?
What?
I guess I should
do this right?
What an idiot!
The thing people
fear most,
isn't death, probably.
It's being forgotten.
We're all here, now.
We all wanted
someone to know.
You'll be just fine
You don't keep losing
you're temper
because you're sick,
Takuya.
If you make friends
at this school,
you'll get better
Because all the kids here
are just like you
I promise I'll come
and get you.
Please, let's go.
One day,
they'll all disappear
Family, friends...
But I'll always be
by your side.
I can't do anything
for you,
but I'll be there
for you.
I promise...
Nobu,
Kawada, all you guys...
I'm not wrong, am I?
I'm fighting along...
with the best of you,
right?
You OK?
Mimura-san!
Run!
Shit!
Blowing a couple
of guys away
won't change a thing
in this country
But I don't know
any other way.
Survive this!
And don't look back!
The phalanx of skyscrapers
slowly collapses into rubble...
And then, finally the rain let up.
How much blood
has been shed?
How many tears spilled?
All of our friends
who fought beside us
are dead, killed
in the last 3 years.
But even as justice
can never be vanquished
We terrorists will never vanish,
however evil they deem us
Because we know
That a handful of adults,
a handful of nations
selfishly define the nature of peace
and freedom in this world.
But our world is so
much more complex than that.
This world has 6.3 billion
people living their own lives
in 6.3 billion
different ways,
6.3 billion kinds
of peace,
6.3 billion kinds
of freedom
6.3 billion kinds
of war and evil
No one has achieved peace
without fighting for it
Behind every peace, there's a river
of blood, sweat and tears
Connected to global host
computers worldwide.
But if we avert
our eyes from
that history
and abandon it,
then peace might as well
be Dog Shit.
Dog Shit, huh?

To all the abandoned

Let's rise up together,
and fight together!
We're throwing away the old rules
taking off to a world far, far away.
To all the adults who stole
our freedom and pinned us down.
Tonight, I will send
this message.
Merry Christmas

Nanahara Shuya
Evacuate!
Are you OK?
Look after the baby.
Look after children.
Who fired the missiles!
We're still investigating!
Sensei,
a call for you
Who the hell
is it from!
It's...
the Prime Minister.
Put him through
Yes, sir
Hey, Sensei,
what a mess, huh?
Who do you think
fired those missiles?
We finally pissed
THAT country off
I got a call from the President.
They're going to attack in 12 hours.
What the hell is going on
with your class?!
What are you waiting for!
So what if a dozen kids die,
it doesn't matter.
Fire a missile and blow up
the whole damned island.
You really mean that?
You surprise me.
I thought you were
a full-fledged adult
who'd crossed the line
a long time ago.
You do understand.
There are only two sides,
the winners or the losers.
Which side are you on?
Fight with THAT country
for JUSTICE and FREEDOM
Cut the crap,
you murderer!
What?
Half a century ago,
THAT country compared
ours to a 12 year-old.
How old does that make
THAT country now!
If any country pisses it off,
it just bombs them.
You call that
adult behavior?!
Listen, the whole world's rallied
behind THAT country.
And who made that choice?
So what the hell
are you doing there?
I see. Too bad.
I had hopes for you.
Exercising my full power as Prime Minister,
I call upon the armed forces
Prepare for battle
immediately.
Before THAT country
launches its missiles
I want every last terrorist
and Nanahara Shuya
DEAD!
Attention!
Salute!
Taku!
Taku!
Taku

Kuze
You OK?
I can't really move.
But we've got
to get back.
Or Nao will worry.
You're hurt.
Save your strength.
How ironic...
What?
I've always waited long time
to talk with you alone, Takuma.
My wish finally came true...
But then this...
I was ready to die
any time...
But... but... but...
Kuze!

DEAD (9 To Go)
A drink?
No thanks.
It's nearly dawn.
Our battle with the adults
is about to begin.
In the 6 months
we've been here,
We've stumbled
on a mine shaft.
It might lead back
to the mainland.
Take the children
and escape.
What about you?
We'll stay here and
draw the enemy in.
This is no place for you.
The real struggle lies ahead.
Truly living life
is 100 times harder

I don't understand things
much and I don't want to.
But if I run away now,
I'm turning my back on
something important.
You want to go back?
I can't go back,
I promised Shuya.
I...
What am I supposed to do?!
Decide by yourself.
I'm going.
Kyoko-san!
I was always
in love with you!
Go then.
Yes!
I'm sorry, I always
make you worry.
I'll see you again, right?
Of course!
I'm going
to find an answer.
Kaido!
What are you idiots
doing here?!
We're in this together!
Hey! Hey!

No big deal...
I'm glad
you are my friend.

To honor the ones
who've died?!

Gotta hand it to you.
You've got guts.
Every adult in the world
wants you DEAD.
From now on, you'll have to live
with all the lives you've taken.
Including my daughter,
who died in your terrorist attack.
Neither of us have
anywhere to call HOME.

One question,
in life there's only the winning
or the losing team.
Is that really true?
Go.
You'll only find the answer
 by living your life.

I always wanted to play
rugby with you guys...
Just go.

Can I ask you something?
That girl in the painting...
Nakagawa Noriko.
What's she like?
Who are you?
Kitano Shiori
I'm a daughter of
the teacher you killed.
Noriko always
looks you straight in the eye
and smiles openly.
Listen,
If you hate someone, you have
to be prepared for the consequences.
I'm sorry...

Noriko...!
Welcome back.
Once again there was
nothing I could do.
Did you know?
Even in this country, which
has been in war for 20 years now.
A beautiful spring
comes back again.
There is no season
that doesn't come back.
See you.

as far as we want.
We have a future,
as long as we
desire to have one.
