The vaults are secure mountains, interspersed
in granite beneath our feet.
Grandfather in Scotland could say:
"The money could not be safer
of sea-serpent of Loch Ness! "
Let's go this way.
Can I push myself before?
"Miss Serena.
Beautiful name.
I think the name
flavor.
"Miss Serena
of course, is a quiet man.
- That I'm trying to ask.

Give me 500 - Lapp.
Is it a thousand pieces?
I get some like that too.
One last question ...
Where are the women's small room?
Thanks for your help.

Mr. Elcot? Congratulations to the robbery
in others the opening day.
- Throw out the man!
- He is the commissioner.
- He does not sound like a commissioner.
- You do not look like a bank.
I defended the bank.
The police would have!
The police does not run into bank
Until the bank is robbed.
Softer your piece. Come along.
Why did you have so much money
this mistake?
It was a publicity stunt.
We have noted currency codes.
Complicated to switch hundreds of dollars
Someone in automatic ...
Imagine a thousand bucks
The chiming 25 - trout!
- Are you fund of bank robberies?
- You're too tense.
Not good for the stomach. Span and
Let the insurance company get ulcers.

I suggest you call
r?dtopp one in yellow dress.
- She has certainly changed in appearance.
- We have the robbery on film.

You take the roll to labbbet.

Call my wife.
Mrs. Elcot is here, Dr. Mannix.
She is welcome.
Hello, Gregory.
Sorry I'm late.
It happened so much.
Nice! What a day ...
I hope that you have
tried to escape from reality.
Well, in a way I fled ...
You are so cute that I must forgive.
Gregory!
You never said before.
Penelope, we do not love each other.
It's just something that you believe.
I do not think I love you.
- I think you do not?
- No. Not for a moment.
How so? Are you disappointed?
- Not at all. I am relieved.
- It's good.
An interesting day ...
Would you tell?
First, as I shopped.
Then I went on the art museum.
Very nice show!
Lunch at the Plaza Palm Court.
Eggs Benedict.
And just before the at. 15
I robbed my husband's bank.
- Are you asleep?
- No ...
- You do not associate.
- How do you mean?
You shop,
go to a museum, eating lunch.
Then you said something totally irrelevant.
I said I was robbed
my husband's bank.
Not at all! I know exactly
What you can and can not do.
- You want to bet?
- Gladly. I bet my good name!
- Can I invest it?
- What is it?
- Prey. Say it is not so?
- Prey?
Penelope ...
- You think you've robbed a bank.
- Yes.
Then I bought this dress.
Should I believe --
- That you robbed your husband's bank
and bought clothes for prey?
No, I did not pay with booty.
I have a credit card.
- How do you robbed the bank?
- I just ...
I do not want to hear!
I understand. You would be
accomplice. Sorry, Gregory.
- We forget that.
- No!
- How much did you receive?
- 130000, said a man on the street.
- Terrible!
- But only 60000th
You get 60.000 easily.
- Well, if you have a gun.
- You do not have a gun.
Do not say it. What does it look like?
Sorry, I did not know that the
was loaded. I bought it.
This is not good for your therapy.
Sorry, Gregory.
I must have ...
... missed something.
Tell me about
the first time you took something.
When I Tossede, you mean.
I am an compulsive thief.
I do not accept that word.
When was the first time?
First time
was last week at college.
It was examensbal
and I had done me fine.
Professor Klobben
was an anthropologist.
He wanted to show some pictures
Of okokos strain.
He said they had told
strange customs.
But the property was
Professor Klobben ...
HELP
I had something in his hand.
I do not know how it happened --
but I had his watch chains.
I could have made it back,
but kept it as a souvenir.
So Began my criminal career.
Without that I really wanted.
And next time?
I moved to New York, here
James, and Tossede anything.
Not until ... The wedding!
I'll never forget
how handsome James was.
Oh, I was in love with him.
Mildred Halliday also.
Her father
sitting in the bank's board.
Suddenly James was gone.
Mildred was also gone.
I suspect not;
but I was curious.
Well ... I did not really know
what I would say.
- Let's eat cake.
- We're talking just about the wedding ...
Yes, I heard it.
All kiss the bride,
no one thinking of the bride groom.
Besides I please ...
Jim, you have lipstick on your face.
Do not be sotis. Jimmy and I
are old friends. Bye.
I wanted to chop her down,
but the knife was too dull.
- Do you want an explanation?
- No, it is not necessary.
- How was it?
- Nothing in particular.
- Do you have dried up lipstick?
- Yes. How so?
James was not at all
as a bank.
They will!
Discard the bouquet now.
Mildred stared superior to me.
I decided to throw
bouquet for her.
Mildred! Excuse me, what happened?
Bye.
Goodbye, dear. Now remember
to be terribly happy.
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Jim.
My earrings!
We came home ten days later.
Everything was left in the pot.
- You did not reverse things?
- No! Why would I?
If you encounter issue with the question,
I can not help you.
- I'll do better.
- Think about it now.
Following these theft,
have you felt guilty?
Worried? Sorry? Upset?
- Happy.
- How can you be happy?
Gregory, that's why I'm here.
Why do theft me happy?
- You can not be happy!
- Now do you think I lie.
Kleptoman I;
but I do not lie.
You are not a compulsive thief,
for you steal for your pleasure.
- Now you're mad at me.
- Yes. And the session is over.
- Why?
- In ...
I can not keep me neutral.
Incidentally, this is the final time.
- Yes?
- Mr. Elcot want to talk to his wife.
- What is it that is so important?
- Perhaps the robbery.
He did not have time to eat dinner.
Why not? No?
Good grief!
What? Is it true? When?
Can I come?
I promise not to be late.
They have filmed robbed.
I may come and watch the movie.

- The role ends in prison.
Now I hurry. Bye!

- Hopefully in 20 years.
Tomorrow. Same time.
If you are still at large ..
Dr. Knobloch, I do analysis.
I'm in love with a Bank Robber.

The gift is deductible.
Wait a minute ...

The color dress do not you.

What would you pay?
- $ 20.
- 21!
- See, it is broken.
- Then I will not buy.
Me neither.
Seven dollars. Overpriced!
But I am always so generous.
Sadaba, my beloved!
You know what this is?
It can not be anything else!
- There must be Givenchy.
- For seven dollars!
- You are a genius.
- And you are an angel.
It can be sold for the 500th
Even the 600th
Help the poor. Open Heart.
Open Heart.
Help the poor.
- It is better to give than take.
- Yes, that's it.
Sad that it is not inverted.
Wait, I forgot ...
Nevermind.
Biscuits?

- At the time ...
- What now?
- It's my wife.

Drive Slow ...
- She just went.
- Run the film backwards.
Wonderful!
Young woman, 165 cm,
red hair, yellow dress.
She is beautiful.
Sorry, Mrs.. Elcot.
- You're welcome.
- There was not much help.
No. Everyone else's faces were the
Clear any time. You were handsome.
- And Miss Serena was wonderful.
- She sat and gaped ...
- The cameras are well positioned ...
- We are not filming in toilets.
Bixbee. Ah, well.
- Now things start to happen.
- Already?
Well done! We set up
a road block in Times Square.
The commissioner, thanks!
James, yes, he is cute!
Inspector Bixbee ...
- I have already given.
- I'm Major Higgins.
- And I'm busy.
- Do not Say That to Major.
Can the commissioner say
If the banknote is genuine?
- How did you get it?
- For a young lady. Approximately at. 17th
Can you describe her?
- Mrs. Elcot, stand-up.
- Gladly.
Yes, she was just as long.
The same figure. But ...
- But?
- But she was blonde.
- Something else?
- "She broke into French.
And she had a land.
Excuse me ... Here.
- What did she say?
- She said:
"It is better to give than take.
We need people like her.
Willing and ...
- And happy?
- Yes, precisely.
A very nice man.
No good note?
It is stolen from
Mr. Elcot the bank.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was hoping ..
Major, wait!
- It's wrong!
- It's the law.
What law?
Why can not he keep it?
- He has received the note!
- It's stolen goods.
- Can not you do something?
- Unfortunately not.
- James, do something.
- What?
- Give him a check.
- How much?
$ 1000.
You take hundreds of dollars from him.
- There is still no cost to you.
- What do you mean?
He gives you a thousand dollars
and you give him as much.
Unbelievable!
If you do not give him a check
I stop talking to you.
Please, we want to help people.
Not cause problems.
Sorry. Please, James?
Thank you, darling!
- 500?
- Thousand.
When the Red Cross and YMCA
get to know this ..
James does not understand
That it is snug up.
- Maybe he is just Stubborn.
- No, he is confused.
It may not be a bank.
- Is milk healthy?
- It relieves ulcer.
The commissioner was kind
that saved my shoes.
Why I Tossede his badge?
Gregory!
You put the milk in his wind pipe?
Penelope ... Penelope ...
Have you considered switching to a psychiatrist?
- No, it would be unfair.
- I can not help you.
It allows you to make certain.
I will return the tray.
It's not just that.
- Just Because I robbed a bank ...
- Your husband's bank.
- Yes. James Bank.
- Why not another bank?
- Why do you write with your left hand
- Now I am equally guilty.
Can you lick?
I am a dry mouth.
- Why did you marry him?
- James has not always been like that.
I met him at
'Great Pig. "
I worked there.
It was my first job in New York
you understand me
and when you are away
the world is dark
the sun is gray
you can lift me to heaven
Give me wings and flight
but without you Night and Day
the world is dark
the sun is gray
Moon has you sitting up there
stars as well
all the good in me
is your discoveries
Only one thing is wrong
the sun is gray
the sun is gray
Devil err talking!

No. I have written about

- As I Should Have?
- Yes.
If you have not received my letters?
- Do not know. I never open mail
- Who does it for you?
None. I put the letters in a box.
- And then I forget them.
- When you lose your friends.
No. If you write and I reply,
you must write again.
If I answer it too
you must write again.
Soon, we just sit and write
and do not have time to be friends.
- Right?
- It was a new idea ...
- I'll see if I find your letters
- Yes, we need to talk about heritage.
No, now I lost the lens.
The trousers are dirty.
Can we meet tomorrow?
Yes. Dinner?
Wonderful.
The lens is so small ...
- Do you see better without lenses?
- Much better.
They will do no good at all.
Why use them?
- His eyes beam and more.
- Your eyes Radiate themselves.
You are very beautiful.
Where can I go with the lentils.
- Good to have you.
- So do I..
- Is a pleasure to meet you tomorrow.
- Do I.
Now I want to get up,
you have a knee in my hair.
- Sorry.
- Beware!
Sorry, I am so sorry.
- How did it go?
- There is no danger.
Good grief.
You found the lens!
Yes?

- Is it the bank?
- Yes. Can I come up?
- No. Come down instead.
I understand.
Hello. I'm not too fine?
No. Come in and health.
This is James Elcot!
- Odd clothes for a bank.
- Shall I come back?
- No. You are fine as you are.
- Penelope, help!
- I can not do it here.
- Do not panic, I will.
- I know you!
- Do you have money in my bank?
- I have money in the mattress!
- You are also welcome.
Yesterday did you leave the room
when I played.
- Sorry.
- Shall I play for you?
- Without the complication?
- I can improvise.
- I have to save my friend.
- Prepare my presentation first.
All Right.
- Should I play Greensleeves?
- Stop, he's mine!
You are good at taking people.
My friends are included in the clean.
- That thing too?
- No, I went out with a welder.
- Could he not drive?
- No, another had junkyard.
So you see many guys.
Why?
In order to discover what I like.
An honest answer.
One more time?
- Where did all go?
- I'm here.
Three weeks later we got married.
Everything went so fast.
Did you steal things about James
Still been romantic?
James can not keep up with romance.
And therefore you are stealing.
You are not even worried.
There is no
connects me to the robbery.
The yellow dress.
Police are looking for it.
- I've made myself of it.
- Fires you on?
- I gave it to charity.
- It was not so wise.
- Should I buy it back?
- No, Penny.
- Would you be arrested?
- Would I Tossede it in the bin
- It would have been better.
- It was a Givenchy.
You do not throw
Givenchy one in the bin.
It has cost James $ 1100.
Inspector Bixbee?
It was unexpected.
- Do you shop here?
- Yes, you can find bargains.
- They had the yellow dress.
- No? How they got it?
As the Major had a thousand patches.
A woman who broke up in French.
Lady was reading about it in the newspaper
and called us.
And we were clever enough
to take the phone.
- Someone bought it for seven dollars.
- Seven?
- For cheap?
- Do not know, I have not seen it
Come along, we'll retrieve it.
We go police car with siren.
- Run, he is always so wild?
- He made himself into.
My life's first raid.
Are you going to blow up the door?
No, it's the old style.
Now we are polite and kind.
- Follow my example.
- Okay, boss.
- The commissioner!
- Penelope.
Horatio. Dad was formed.
Extremely delicious pastrami.
Pickles. There are also mums.
I get heartburn.
Give me a soda.
Good day. Welcome to
Princess Sadaba.
- A chic store.
- Bless you.
Domestic champagne ...
What can the Princess Zabad
be of service? I know!
You want to first look at
An evening dress.
- No, a suit.
- Exactly, Sadaba know.
It should be light.
I go to Portofino.
Portofino! It's fate!
Download the suit that I've saved!
I'm psychic. For three weeks ago
I bought the suit from Paris.
I knew you need it
in Puerto Rico.
Honey, get the suit.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Here it is. Direct from Paris.
- Still hot ...
- Try it.
- Why?
- Yellow dress.
I'm more than psychic,
I am a genius.
- It's perfect for her.
- That is exactly what I thought.
- Me too!
- It's perfect.
- Yes, perfect.
- Thank you. I want to buy it.
Upon reflection,
I would like to keep it.
Take it off, I do not want to sell it.
- How much?
- You get it for nothing.
- $ 600.
- Sessan, you are not a bit cheeky.
- As to speak is not a princess
- Honey, get the box.
He kills me, but for your wife's sake
we can say $ 595th
- She is not my wife.
- I do not say a word.
Please feel free word.
Inspector Bixbee.
Favorite ...
- Cops!
- We have not done anything.
You are not suspected of anything.
The suit appeared in a bank robbery.
- It was in every newspaper.
- Not Christian Science Monitor.
- I'm sure that it suits you.
- We take the suit, Mrs.. Elcot.
- Go ahead.
- Seven dollars for the forest ...
- Mayor Lindsay pays.
- We earn paltry three U.S. dollars ..
- Fine business. I'll be back.
- You are always welcome.
Bye.
The name, your face ..
Where have I seen her?
We go to the library --
and look in Vogue.
- Cool Aunt.
- 600 is not too much.
- For second-hand clothes?
- It's Givenchy.
It said nothing about her.
- No?
- No.
She said Paris.
And The Associated understood.
Oh, yeah ...
This is fine.
It does not look very true here
in my profession.
It is the finest place in New York.
Better than Hanken, Mrs.. Elcot?
- Why do you say 'Mrs.. Elcot?
- All right, Penelope.
Penelope,
I usually feel comfortable with the job.
- What is it?
- Chewing gum.
- Can I taste?
- Go ahead.
- Who is Ron Swoboda?
- I just chew.
Often, it is suspected
the most innocent person.
Because he is natural.
The person is careful
what he says and does.
- Caution to disclose them.
- Fascinating.
- How do you do?
- Have you ever been low?
- I had braces.
- Poke your tongue and blow.
- I could!
- Nyb?rjartur.
Penelope, I am the best
cops that I know.
That is my problem.
- I'm too good.
- You seem very good.
The girl who robbed bank
has not a chance.
In my childhood street
had three options.
You could become villain,
a cop or a priest.
I was not good at bobbing
and we were not Catholics.
If I had grown up there ..
- Are you often in the bank?
- Almost never. How so?
You knew what the cashier called.
Name plate on the counter.
Did not you see it?
No. I'm not so smart
I thought ...
Good grief,
I would meet with James.
Can I keep Ron Swoboda?
Horatio, see!
- Not bad, huh?
- Great.
James made a career.
Third vice-director of other
and finally deputy director.
There we crux!
He leaves you outside of his life.
Therefore compensate you.
I devoted myself to hobbies.
First with James.
It was not so good.
I tried with the hobby for James.
James, we won!
Good girl. Good dog.
He patted me first ..
Nothing helped.
Funny. The only hobby that
cheered me up was broken into.
You do not break!
You just twitches.
Burglary sounds so exciting.
How many burglaries have you done?
What people have you stolen from?
- Only people.
- Your husband's colleagues and acquaintances?
Yes. I hated it.
James could never forget the job.
'The Chairman
explanation ...
Let's swim.
Can not wait?
In Newport, it was Johanna Keller.
She was a major banking client.
After that she started
keep at a distance.
When we went out and danced, came
James clients and destroyed everything.
I have to talk to them.
You do not dance with them in the bank.
I love you. But I would
not like to do business with you.
La Bostella! Now we dance.
When the music stops
do we fall in a heap!
I had to do something.
A tiara, brooches,
bracelets and a necklace.
- My best coup was ...
- Stop it!
- I can tell you for hours!
- I do not want to hear.
- Do not get depressed this time.
- A psychiatrist is not feeling depressed!
- Good. There are bright spots.
- Advise me.
The marriage was so sad
that if I was not compulsive thief -
I would have been crazy.
It is certainly not easy
to be your analysts.
You would hit me before.
I was terribly superficial.
A real dumsnut.
Thank goodness I have improved myself.
- What does it mean to forget about the shoes?
- We have seven minutes left.
I'm going to gallery and
steal one Rembrandt.
Rembrandt? Penny ...!
Taxi!
- Gregory?
- Police.
- They may shade me.
- Gregory! What Have You Done?
- I have not done anything.
- Why should the police shadow you?
Penelope, do not discuss now.
- What have you done with the money?
- What money?
- Booty ...!
- Oh, the money.
I did not dare put them somewhere.
I have them on me.
- The commissioner looked me up.
- He was a little weird yesterday ..
- Strange? How?
- He seemed ... required.
Why would he ...
Never mind.
- You must return the money.
- How would it go?
Give me money so I will arrange it.
- I do not want to involve you.
- Give me everything.
Penny ...
- How do I look?
- The Batman.
You are kind,
but why do you do it?
I'm crazy about you.
Psychologically.
- But you said ...
- Forget it!
Let's go. Try to act natural.
- We are locked up.
- No problem.
Anyone hear the alarm and will.
What if they frisk us!
- We have not stolen anything.
- What is it?
- Hello!
- Not yet!
- Let us out.
- What have you done?
- Nothing.
- Call the boss.
I'm the boss.
Where do you hide?
- Over there.
- We hid not us!
- Know ye not that we are closed?
- Yes, and now we want to go.
If you strip-search us
We call on the police.
It says she is not.
- Are you insane?
- I do not like your tone.
Now I am not going back.
Come, Gregory!
- Good morning, darling.
- Hello? Yes.
What? Is it true?
It sounds incredible.
About half an hour. Yes.
- Who was that?
- Bank.
- What did they want?
- Talk to me.
- About what?
- Bank.
- Where does it on the economy?
- Interest you?
Yeah, I'm your wife.
- Funny ...
- The economy?
I was hoping it was
good news of the robbery.
- A good news about bad news?
- You might get the money back.
- Look under the heading 'Miracle'.
- You got a thousand patches.
If there is a trend
I am ruined.
James, you do not understand!
Yes. There was even up.
Hurray, I am happy.
There was even up!
- Dr. Mannix says you are stubborn.
- Is he saying that?
- What does he know about me?
- I am telling you.
- I will tell you everything.
- Everything?
- Yes.
- About me?
- Sure.
- I will talk to him.
- Good. He can help you.
- I do not need help.
- Why else?
- Inspector Bixbee.
- You got your money back.
- Yes, I underestimated you.
who took them.
- She sits in the interrogation.
- I do not understand ...
I was equally surprised. I thought
I had figured it out.
- Wait, James, I go with you.
- You do not get involved.
Perhaps it is the wrong girl.
No, she had money on it.
Right this way.
Hello! Are you a beginner?
We have never met.
What is your name?
- Penelope.
- Honeysuckle Rose.
You are fine. It looks
like a real mink fur.
Now we calms us down!
No offense, Mrs. Elcot.
It is real mink and she is married
with the head of the bank.
Oops. She's cute.
- What's your real name?
- Honeysuckle Rose!
- You go to Washington Square.
- There we drove past!
- Can we get to the point?
- Tell me from the beginning.
Okay.
I aerated cat
at three o'clock in the night.
Then I saw the money
lie on the sidewalk.
No! You robbed my bank
two days ago!
Do I look like a bank robber?
- No, not at all!
- Air a cat in the middle of the night ...?
She is working enough at night.
Do you?
- Yes.
- Where do you hear!
Then we know it.
But, Penelope, you misunderstand.
She is not suspected of
Air cat, but for bank robbery.
I've never been in the bank!
I believe you.
But they do not believe me.
They want to lock me
and toss the key.
You will only make it worse for you
by inventing.
- I can not find it!
- Lock her up.
I lied.
No, wait, I admit.
The money was not on the sidewalk.
They were stuck in the door.
I was going to return them.
But that does not make me
to bank robbers.
- Hold on, you are doing wrong!
- The police know best.
Maybe she is telling the truth!
Could someone add 59,000
outside the bank in the middle of the night?
- Yes.
- Who?
- She wanted to get rid of money.
- Give them back?
Yes. She did not have the money.
She only took money for ..
Yes, she could not resist.
The theory is based on sympathy.
- Lock her up.
- No!
You should get a confession.
- Miss Rose does not want to admit.
- R?narens confession.
The woman in the yellow dress.
It was me!
Sorry, James.
I explain later.
Now, truth
so she does not become locked.
- I'll admit everything.
- Mrs. Elcot is upset.
Run home, and let her sleep.
You will not believe!
You do not understand that it's true!
- You think I'm crazy.
- No. But sometimes ...
- All we need help sometimes.
- I'm not upset.
My head has never been clearer
I go to a psychiatrist
five times a week.
- Lock her up.
- Do not worry, Miss Rose.
- I'll convince them.
- Thank you. But .. the thing is
Not even I believe you.

- Why do you not me?
That you are compulsive thief?
Would you believe that about me?
Yes, if you say it.
I trust you.
- In the night you lay in bed with me.
- Yes, we're married.
- But the money!
- Oh.
Gregory would arrange it for me.
He will not help you
by allowing you to fantasize.
I robbed the bank
that you neglect me.
- You look just for me.
- I am sure.
What do you want from me?
I give you everything.
There is only one thing ...

A cocktail party?

Or come to my door!
Hi, Mildred.
Welcome to the party.
James, take care of Mildred.
Poor little thing.
Mildred, do me a favor.
Kiss someone else.

But it's not as nice.
Two double whiskeys in the same glass.
I wish to have.
Good evening.
Good evening, James.
- What's the point?
- Wait and see.
Welcome, Miss Heller.
Been in simp?len recently?

Daphne, watch out for thieves
when you go to the disco.

A memory from my wedding day.
Your humor is so funny.
I do not know what kind of things.

- Let her go.
I have to stop her.
All night. I am so worried.
She is disappointed in you
and come to me.
Take it easy, we do our best.
If she needs protection
then she told me.
Miss Serena. Beautiful name.
I think the name characterizes ..
Armored Glass. Turn off the alarm!
The eggs and my yogurt.
I will notify you!
Let's look under the mask.
- This, she said nothing about.
- Her? Who?
A ploy, "she said. I thought
her sad, brown eyes.
The girl was crying!

- Young and cute. White dress.
About as long.
Honey, it's me!
It is not you ...

- Did you see a girl leave the bank?
- She went nicely?
- Yes. Where did she?
- In the city.
City?

- Your face ...
You looked like my wife.
And I thought I was ugly ..
Run to the police.
Penelope!
- I knew you did to me.
- Who else?
Someone has robbed the bank again.
I believe you.
- Was it you?
- Both times.
I have solved Elcot case.
When I grow up
I want to be an equally good cop.

- I promise.
I do it.
Then we will not

A brilliant career.
Mr. Elcot, were received.

Whiskey solves nothing.

- I knew you did to me.
- Yes, who else?
- Glad that you are well maintained.
I'm afraid. I must be sick.
They pretend that I do not
bobbed jewelry!

- Your sacrifice is greater villains.
They swam insurance
and do not want jewelry back.
- I'm cured!
- Are you there?
Yes. I have just robbed the bank again.
- But you are healed?
- Yes.
I wept as I did.
Thefts makes me happy anymore.
Now I'm not compulsive thief!
Is not it wonderful?
It's horrible.
No stealing, no hobbies.
Marriage.
It feels rotten.
Is it wonderful?
- What should I do?
- Marry me.
You know me as a father figure,
but I could be your lover too.
But I'm too tall and too old.
My clothes are taking up too much space.
In addition, I snore.
I have a stomach ulcer ...
Dr. Knobloch, I need help!
How could you do this to me?
I can not be turned down!
Penelope?
Dr. Mannix -
- You must help me.
I see Penelope everywhere.
The bank, in the taxi.
You also look like Penelope.
I love her. I was stupid
who neglected him.
- I talk too much?
- No, continue.
I'm mad!
Your voice sounds like her.
I want to find her -
and say I need her.
- The Doctor needs help!
- Everyone needs help.
But the only doctor we understand it.
The best help you get home.
- What does it mean to forget about the shoes?
- That we are healed, darling.
