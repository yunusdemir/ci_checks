AMY FOSTER
INSPIRED B Y JOSEPH CONRAD'S
SHORT STORY "AMY FOSTER"
- Look Mama, the sea.
- Yes, the sea.
That is where you came from.
Amy! Amy!
Amy...
My daughter's taken a turn.
She's asked for you.
I sent a man to fetch Dr. Kennedy.
Go on there!
Don't worry, Miss Swaffer.
I won't leave you.
Thank you for your care, Amy.
You'll not be needed further.
Sir, I had intended to stay
here through the night.
If I consider it necessary,
I will stay.
Leave the doctor to attend me, Amy.
God bless you.
Really, Doctor!
Your cruelty was unnecessary.
- Will she die, Mama?
- Dr. Kennedy's with her.
- Who's the doctor?
- Come on, young man.
Why do you hate her so much?
Do you, too,
consider her a simpleton?
It is not my purpose
to consider Amy Foster at all.
You risk gangrene of the blood.
I must cut away the poisoned flesh,
or you will die of it tonight.
Perhaps that gives me license
to be bold.
Reluctant as you may be
to <i>consider</i> Amy, -
- it would comfort me to know
the tale entire.
- If I am to die...
- You will not die!
I will not permit it.
Perhaps it will ease my fever.
And yours, too.
I dare say no one person
knows the tale entire.
But perhaps I know more than most.
He said he was a mountaineer...
From a remote corner
of the Carpathian Mountains.
<i>They called him Yanko. </i>
<i>His family sold a cow and some land</i>
<i>in order to pay for his journey. </i>
<i>Yanko carried with him their hopes</i>
<i>and dreams for a better world. </i>
<i>A land of freedom. </i>
<i>He called it</i>
<i>"a land of true gold. "</i>
America!
America!
Yanko...
- <i>Yanko, I'm here!</i>
- Stefan!
- We are the lucky ones.
- We are the lucky ones?
<i>Farewell, farewell!</i>
<i>The journey was long and grueling. </i>
<i>Yanko and his companions</i>
<i>were locked in the cattle cars. </i>
<i>Dirty, hungry and cold. </i>
<i>Finally they arrived at the ship</i>
<i>in which they would cross the sea. </i>
HAMBURG, GERMANY
Stefan!
- Stefan!
- <i>We'll meet in America!</i>
- To America!
- To America!
<i>At least he had his dream</i>
<i>for company. </i>
- And found himself a nightmare.
- Until he met Amy Foster.
Fate is both inscrutable
and merciless, Miss Swaffer.
You're determined to blame Amy, like
those who say she brought the storm.
You insult me.
Witchcraft and other despicable
superstitions are abhorrent to me.
<i>But I won't deny that I always</i>
<i>found her a strange creature. </i>
<i>She was the product</i>
<i>of a family scandal. </i>
<i>She was sent to work at Smith's</i>
<i>farm when only twelve years old. </i>
<i>I admit she was a mystery to me. </i>
<i>But I never thought Amy was a witch</i>
<i>or a simpleton. </i>
Go on there, now!
Tom, William! Get the horses
down the back meadow, quickly!
The devil is riding this wind!
Tom, get those pigs out of there!
Amy? Amy Foster!
What the bloody hell...?
Amy!
Why are you in the dark?
Go and make Mr. Smith some tea.
- What's up?
- Ship down, in the bay.
My boys, my boys!
Where are my fine boys?
Don't fret for your boys. It was an
immigrant ship, not one of our own.
Not one of our own...
Praises be.
Praises be to God!
- Hold your tongue, Widow Cree!
- The sea will curse me for that.
- 'Tis a curse!
- There, there.
- We will be cursed!
- Quiet!
No one else is going to be cursed!
Not one amongst you.
But we will see our duty done
by this tragic day.
Ladies...
Take care for her.
The rest of us have work to do.
Did you save any, Doctor?
I have looked into every face. There
is not a living soul amongst them.
"I was not in safety,
neither had I rest, -
- neither was I quiet.
Yet trouble came. "
There's no more I can do.
These souls are in Your hands now.
The ailments of the living
do not wait upon the dead.
Amy...
For God's sake, bolt the door!
Stay away from that window.
William, William!
There's a beast in the yard!
- What in damnation is going on?
- There's a lunatic in the yard.
By Christ!
I'll get rid of the blackguard.
I'll teach him to go around
frightening women.
I'll sort him out,
that I will.
All right now, let's be having you!
All right, my friend.
If you'll bear with me... let's see
if we can't work something out.
<i>Thank you sir, for letting me rest</i>
<i>on your property. </i>
- <i>I've done nothing wrong. </i>
- All right, you go down here.
<i>I'm not a beggar,</i>
<i>I'm a traveler. </i>
- Christ almighty!
- Dog, get down, down!
Don't!
- He meant no harm.
- Get you in that house, girl.
Get you in, now!
Get you on with your work.
Can you eat this?
<i>Dear lady... </i>
<i>Dear lady... </i>
Thank you for coming over so prompt.
- He's madder than a March hare.
- Haven't seen one of them in years.
Last time I did,
it seemed like any other variety.
Perhaps you mistake my meaning.
I believe, like others, -
- that this creature escaped from
a lunatic asylum. God knows where.
Your advice would comfort me.
But maniacs do not lack for cunning.
When I wrestled him in here
he looked like a monster, -
- and it crossed my mind that that's
what he was. Watch yourself, sir.
Why, he was filthy as a pig...
Did you open this door?
You could have got us all murdered!
- He was dirty.
- You washed him? Good Christ, girl!
If you weren't an idiot, I'd suspect
unnatural practices. Get inside!
I'd suggest this man would benefit
from the services of a barber.
But as we both know, such
is not available in these parts.
All too true, sir.
Just the same, I do be damned
if I know what to do with him.
He is a funniosity.
That's the last we'll see of him.
Let old Swaffer sort him out!
<i>I won't forget, dear lady!</i>
<i>Never, never!</i>
<i>It must have been terrible to be</i>
<i>helpless in a foreign land. </i>
<i>That winter, Yanko endured</i>
<i>overwhelming loneliness. </i>
I'm paid to herd sheep, not dig
ditches for someone else's shit!
Swaffer's forgotten
what century we're in.
You'll just have to do enough
for both of us.
<i>He worked for no wages. </i>
<i>To all intents, a slave. </i>
<i>And he had no language</i>
<i>with which to explain himself. </i>
<i>He told me later, his only comfort</i>
<i>was the memory of the girl</i> -
- <i>who had given him bread. </i>
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if Amy ever thought of him. </i>
<i>Her life continued,</i>
<i>without variation. </i>
<i>Each Sunday, she had to visit her</i>
<i>parents, Mary and Isaac Foster. </i>
You're late.
- Mother, Father...
- Why does she come back here?
- She comes to help her mother.
- She's a queer sort.
Is it any wonder,
the way you treat her?
You'd silence the birds
in the trees.
- I put food on her plate...
- <i>She</i> puts food on our table!
- I'll say what I want in my house.
- Your house? It's Swaffer's.
Why remind me of that?
Bloody embarrassment, she is.
- Isaac!
- Picking up rubbish off the beach.
Everybody knows!
Where do you think you're going?
- I'm talking to you, lady!
- Isaac, please!
<i>Isaac had been disinherited</i>
<i>because of his scandalous marriage. </i>
<i>He still blamed Amy</i>
<i>for all their woes. </i>
<i>Perhaps that's why she used silence</i>
<i>as a weapon against them. </i>
<i>They isolated Amy from the village,</i>
<i>so she gave her love to the sea. </i>
<i>But the sea was not lover enough. </i>
<i>But the sea was not lover enough. </i>
Check.
Well, I'll be damned
if you don't have me again.
You've a hard heart at chess, but
don't your laborers get Sunday off?
I don't know if that's
what you'd call him.
Smith caught him in the stack-yard
at New Barns.
Reckons him to be a lunatic.
You've been all over the world.
Tell me, -
- do you think this is a Hindu
we've got here?
Not unless he's undergone
an unlikely conversion.
He puts me in mind of the Basques.
<i>Do you speak Spanish, señor?</i>
<i>You are in England. </i>
<i>Do you speak French?</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>
Thank you, sir.
He's learned a few words
from my daughter.
He seems to call himself
Yankoo Goorall.
Yanko! Please...?
Oh... Yes, by all means.
Moscow? Tolstoy, Checkov...
Oh damn... Think, man!
- The Volga? Kiev?
- <i>Kiev is the capital of my country. </i>
Swaffer, he's a Russian!
- They're great chess players.
- <i>I was on my way to America. </i>
<i>America. </i>
- How long has this man been here?
- Since winter. A couple of months.
- My daughter is better at...
- February 18th.
The day the sea gave up its dead.
Swaffer, you have here the only
survivor of the Eastbay disaster.
Dr. James Kennedy.
Kennedy.
Do you think he knows...
that all his companions perished?
I don't know...
If you can spare him sometimes,
I would like to teach him English.
I don't see why not.
Perhaps he'll teach you chess, so
your visits are worth the journey.
Sit down.
Eat.
It'll be regular from now on.
It's money.
You'll work daylight hours,
Sundays off.
What you do with your own time
is your own business.
There is a girl on the farm...
A girl?
You don't mean our Amy?
Amy? Perhaps it is her name.
A gracious lady...
of great beautiful.
Our Amy? You'd have
as much chance with Swaffer's mare.
And a better time of it too,
I shouldn't wonder!
Mr. Swaffer, you brought the lumber!
William will be so pleased.
- He hasn't heard the price yet.
- Come in for some tea.
- A cup of tea would be civilized.
- You two, stay out here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Hold on, Amy.
Haven't you got a minute for
your poor old father?
Father...
This lad here thinks you're a
gracious lady, did you know that?
"Great beautiful!"
And you do look
quite fetching in that pinny!
Can't take a joke, see?
Don't you want your cake, then?
- No, Kennedy, move no good.
- "That is not a good move. "
"That is not a good move. "
Precisely!
You learn English
faster than I learn chess.
- Miss... helps I, me...
- Miss Swaffer.
Why is Miss in... car-chair?
Some twenty years ago,
she was engaged to be married...
On the eve of her wedding day,
she fell from her horse.
She had a passion for riding.
She broke her spine.
The marriage was quietly forgotten.
By her intended, if not by her.
That is why she always wears
clothes of black?
It would certainly be reason enough.
Why you have not married, Kennedy?
Oh, I was!
A lifetime ago.
Two lifetimes... my wife and child.
A son.
The typhus epidemic of '74
took them both. On the same night.
- But you do not wear black?
- No.
Chess like in the life.
You must look to the forward.
Far to the forward.
Checkmate.
Not so fast!
I've a nice hog's head for you...
There's your ribbon and your change.
Can I help you, sir?
I thought for a moment
it was the Prince of Wales!
These well and strong,
but I have better...
- A real suit, like yours.
- Very handsome, I'm sure.
- And the other one?
- This is... my mystery.
- "This is my secret. "
- "This is my secret. "
Well, every man
is entitled to his secrets.
Especially if he has a fine suit.
Gracious lady...
Forgive me.
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you...
I would like, with your accepting,
if you would be pleased...
Forgive me.
I should like to walk out with you.
You will?
<i>Mother of Jesus, bless you. </i>
Thank you.
When may I call again?
- Sunday is my day.
- Sunday... thank you.
Amy?
Haven't you finished that floor yet?
- <i>Thank you, God!</i>
- You bloody lunatic!
Aye aye...
Look who's here.
Does Swaffer know
you're running loose?
I tell you, Malcolm, that man
must be some kind of epileptic.
The devil take me! Amy, get back in
before the missus comes home!
Well, I never did...
I hope you know what you're doing,
young lady! Do you hear me, Amy?
There'll be hell to pay when your
father finds out, you mark my words!
- Is your country beautiful?
- Yes. The people's hearts are good.
- This is...
- The sea.
The ancient sea, the dark sea...
The cruel sea.
- That's where you came from.
- I remember only blackness, wind.
And the crying of children.
It's where all the hearts of earth
that are lost to love and to fear -
- lie waiting to be reborn.
This is not Christian...
You must be mad yourself, to take up
with a man who's wrong in the head.
If you'd looked into his eyes,
as I have, -
- you'd be able to tell that
that man is dangerous.
You should listen to Mr. And
Mrs. Smith. They care about you.
- We're the talk of the parish.
- It won't be the first time!
- We're the experts, aren't we?
- You're not much of a husband.
But you could try to be
a father to your children.
- Tell her to stay away from him.
- I can't tell <i>her</i> anything.
- I should have chosen your father.
- But I love him!
Go and have your way
with your gypo!
Amy... When I was your age I was
foolish too, do you understand?
- I was in love.
- You and Father were married late.
- I know you were expecting me.
- That madness is treacherous.
- It's God's trick upon us women...
- Mary, get her out of my house!
It's none of my business
how you live your life, -
- but if I catch you round
my farm again, I'll break your head!
And I can't say fairer than that!
Amy! I haven't seen you here
since your schooldays.
Your friend, if that's the reason
you're here, wasn't at the service.
Amy! Forgive me, I am
out of the time to be with you.
You're with me now.
Their faces are so hard.
Their eyes... like glass.
I do not understand this.
I do not.
- I don't care to understand them.
- But we need... yes!
I eat with them, I work with them.
But I do not live with them.
And I don't need to understand them.
How did you know I'm here?
"In memory of that valiant company -
- who sailed to find a new world,
and died in sight of this ground. "
Beautiful words, I think, -
- but for who it is?
Who is dead?
It's for the ship.
Your ship.
My ship?
My ship is in America!
Your ship was swallowed up
by the sea.
No one was left alive...
except you.
Stefan?
All the children?
They're all here.
Don't be sad, my beauty.
Come with me.
This is where I live.
- Do you like my home?
- These things, how did you get?
They're the gifts of the sea.
I never know when they'll come.
But they are always beautiful.
You came from the sea.
- I'm glad it's not my daughter.
- I expect they'll have to be wed.
- There's been no talk of marriage.
- Foreigners treat women queerly.
The worldly-wise wheelwright!
He's never been further than Truro.
What do you know about foreigners?
Or women?
All I'm saying is
these gypsies do take advantage.
He's cast a glamour over her.
That's what they do.
But if they do get wed, she won't
learn anything she doesn't know.
- What do you mean by that?
- You'll miss the money, too!
- She gives her wages to her mother.
- Take no notice.
What does my Amy already know?
All I'm saying is, things have been
seen. Not speculations, things.
- This afternoon, by Wreckers' Cave.
- I'll teach you a lesson!
Gentlemen! Ain't it someone else
needs teaching a lesson?
Amy!
You're think you're it, don't you?
Hobnobbing with the doctor!
Laying your filthy hands
on my daughter!
Father, stop it!
Leave him alone!
Leave him go.
Leave him alone!
Stop it!
Leave him alone!
Father, not the sea!
Father!
I'll put you back out in the sea,
with the rest of them!
Yanko!
Father!
Yanko, my dear fellow!
Careful. Amy, you wait for us in the
parlor. Please, I must tend him.
I can guess who did this.
But why?
They said I was to stay away.
They said if I married her,
they would put me back in the sea.
- Marry who?
- Why, Amy!
Amy?
- Foster's girl?
- Yes. I have been walking with her.
You did not know this?
- Has she agreed to marry?
- I have not asked, but I will.
- You're sure of what you're doing?
- It is the wish of my heart.
I'm not an expert in these things.
Close your eye.
But you should be aware that Amy
has always been a little strange.
Strange?
Explain me.
Her mother brought her to me
when she was nine.
She'd been at school for three years
but still couldn't read or write.
Almost done.
So I examined the child.
I could find no cause,
so I presumed she was slow of mind.
But the next week, to the amazement
of all, she began to read and write.
Perfectly adequately, too.
She kept it up for a month.
And then she stopped.
And as far as anyone knows, she has
not picked up pen or paper since.
You're not happy for me!
I'm always happy to see a friend
follow the wish of his heart.
I have found my true gold.
Then you must hold on to it.
You must rest here till you're fit.
I'll show you to your room.
Where is Amy?
You inhaled a lot of sea water.
Your lungs will be vulnerable.
- I'll take him.
- To the Swaffers? No, that's miles.
I'll care for him.
Kennedy, thank you for your care.
You have made me well.
Very well.
Foster, you are beneath my contempt.
And your daughter's.
The rest of you all saw the bodies
of that man's companions, -
- laid out in hundreds by the church
in which you pretend to pray!
You have disgraced this community.
Bear in mind, as you swill your ale
and tell your filthy tales, -
- that to take part in mob violence
is as low as a man can fall!
- I've had enough of this.
- Don't threaten me, blacksmith!
If it were not for my vocation, I'd
give you the thrashing you deserve.
Goodnight, gentlemen.
And so, Sir and Miss, -
- I ask to be given your permission
to marry Miss Amy Foster.
Well... he won't get
any other girl to marry him.
Go to Darnford today. Ask my good
brother-in-law to pay us a visit.
Tom, get my horse.
Mary, take no notice.
Let people say what they want!
No good will come of this!
- Mary, Isaac...
- Excuse us for bothering you.
Amy, you're coming home
this instant, do you hear?
No!
Leave her be?
Isaac, I'll protect you no longer!
I was carrying you before
he laid hands on me. For his father!
I slaved for them,
like you slave for this lot.
And they both had their fill.
The father and the son.
Isaac's father is your father.
Isaac is your brother!
See?
Not a word, not a tear!
Bad you were conceived,
and bad you've remained.
Come on, Mary.
Come on.
Amy ain't here. Perhaps she did
go back to her mother's after all.
Foster said she'd be
at the Smiths' all night.
No!
Bad you were conceived,
and bad you'll remain.
Amy!
Quick!
Quick!
They've taken my home!
Whatever they do to us, whatever
they take from us, I'm your home!
And you're mine.
I've been looking for you.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't
that the only decent suit you own?
We'll have to find you another.
That one certainly won't do.
And you'll be needing some flowers,
Miss Foster.
Jump on board, then.
You too, Miss Foster.
Go on, then.
Come, my beauty.
Well, get down.
Go on!
My goodness! You look like
you've come from the wars.
Well... here.
REASSIGNMENT
Please...
My father-in-law, Mr. Swaffer, has
asked me to expedite this deed.
This cottage, and the apportioned
acre of land, are made over to you.
In absolute property, -
- without limits of time, and with
full and proper rights of ownership.
- Please...?
- The house is yours. And the land.
- Are you happy, my love?
- So happy!
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- Don't thank me.
It was the daughter's idea.
- Thank you.
- Now, can we all please go home?
Amy Foster,
will you be married to me?
...pour upon you the riches of his
grace, and sanctify and bless you, -
- that you may please Him and live
together until your lives end.
Would you now step forward
and sign the register?
Mind that slave-driver Swaffer.
Don't let him take advantage of you.
And pop round and see us
from time to time.
Amy...
Pay no attention to the missus.
She's just sorry to see you go.
Thank you, Mr. Smith.
We are the lucky ones.
You have a son!
- And they are waiting for you.
- Thank you.
He told me
he wants to see the sea.
Will you show him for me?
<i>My little baby... my little boy. </i>
<i>I will show you the sea. </i>
<i>I will show you the sea. </i>
The sea!
- It's a bastard, that baby!
- It's got a tail!
- Go away.
- She's a witch!
Gypsy, gypsy...!
Go away!
- What's going on here?
- She slapped him.
Never come near my baby again!
Any of you!
Amy... What is wrong?
What has happened?
Yanko...
It's been a while
since you've called on me.
I pay my way.
I work my work.
I take nothing.
Then why still the hating?
- Because you come from far away.
- Everyone comes from somewhere!
It seems without sense, I know,
but to them you are strange.
It forms a gulf
between you and them.
I do not understand,
but for me, I accept. I'm strong.
But for Amy and our boy,
I do not accept.
Amy is different, too.
And I would like my boy
to talk my own tongue.
- That seems natural enough.
- But I don't want it to harm him.
I don't want to make him alone,
to make him different.
It would grieve me if you were to go
but perhaps you should leave here.
Amy, now, is home.
And she is here.
But my boy, yes.
My boy will leave when he's a man.
I don't want him to farm
and herd sheep like me!
I want him to be... like you.
Like me? I'd certainly
think twice about that!
I want him to have the learning
of great men, -
- and to love the mystery
of the universe, like you.
- You will help him?
- I'd be proud to.
Yes?
Yes!
Then... all is good.
It's not healthy to be too isolated.
You should come and visit me.
I've missed our conversations.
And my chess is no better.
- And Amy?
- Amy?
Is Amy to visit with me?
It wasn't what I had in mind,
but yes...
- You do not like Amy.
- Yanko, that's not true.
- It's true. I've seen your eyes.
- I bear Amy no malice at all.
I just don't think she'd be a very
good companion over dinner.
- Yanko!
- Thank you, Doctor!
Yanko...
<i>It was a hard winter. </i>
And his lungs were vulnerable,
yet he was very tough.
He was homesick. Physiologically,
that made the fateful difference.
Amy was his home.
He survived the horror of the wreck.
He learned our tongue,
endured hatred and violence, -
- and earned his property, because
he found his home in Amy Foster.
- As she found her home in him.
- She did not take care for him.
Sit down.
Please.
You cannot imagine
how much she took care for him.
Be still, my love.
Yanko, Yanko...
You! Take that cough on home.
And keep warm.
Go on. Home.
What a night! There's sickness
all over the parish.
He keeps saying something,
I don't know what.
- I can't understand what he says.
- He has pneumonia.
His fever is making him senseless.
Can't you ask someone to come in?
Just for tonight?
Please, sir,
nobody seems to care to come.
The fever will get worse
before it breaks.
Keep him covered, sponge his brow.
Give him plenty of fluids, -
- and this.
It will help the fever a little.
There's some opium in it,
to give him some rest.
Two tablespoons, every six hours.
I must go now.
I've another fifteen miles to make.
Mr. Swaffer might come over, sir.
If you were to ask him.
I'm afraid I must go
in the opposite direction.
I'll be back.
About half past three.
<i>Give me my baby boy... </i>
You must take this.
Kennedy said so. Kennedy...
I'm here, my love.
And Stefan... your little man.
We'll take care of you.
Kennedy is coming.
Kennedy!
- It's Doctor Kennedy.
- Get that thing out of my way!
The wagon's broken down in the mud.
We can't get it out, it's too heavy.
Then lighten the load, man!
<i>For God's sake... </i>
<i>Give me some water. </i>
Yanko, English.
You must speak English.
I don't know what you want.
<i>Give me some water. </i>
<i>Just some water. </i>
<i>A glass of water,</i>
<i>that's all I ask for. </i>
<i>Is it you, Mother?</i>
<i>The sun is so hot,</i>
<i>and I've been working all day... </i>
- <i>Give me some water!</i>
- I don't know what you're saying.
<i>Only this... Help me!</i>
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>
<i>I am your husband,</i>
<i>we are one family. </i>
Please! I don't know what you want.
I don't know how to help you.
- <i>Give me some water. </i>
- No!
You mustn't harm the baby.
I won't let you.
Tell me what you want.
Just tell me what you want!
- <i>Give me some water!</i>
- Don't!
<i>Now, I say, now!</i>
<i>That's all I ask for. </i>
<i>Mother!</i>
My husband has taken sick.
Very sick.
I need someone
to help me sit with him.
You never thought
to bring our grandson before.
- You never invited us.
- Then ask Swaffer. I expect he has.
Swaffer's is six miles!
The Smiths', even further.
That draught'll be the death of us!
Who is it?
Just a gypsy woman selling curses.
I always loved you, Mama.
Even if you could never love me.
Stop!
Please, sir, stop! Please!
What are you doing out here
with that poor infant?
- Do you want to kill him?
- Please, my husband is very sick.
- I need you to help me.
- I have my own to look after.
Get that baby indoors.
Driver!
- Amy... we'd better go.
- Go to your husband.
Your babe will be safe.
Yanko!
Gone...
She is gone.
I must get my bag.
I will be back in a moment.
- Where is she?
- I don't know.
Did I do something wrong?
- Does she not love me anymore?
- I don't know...
- That is, I'm sure...
- I only asked for a little water.
Only a little water.
Excuse me, I must get my bag.
I would change nothing, my love.
My gold!
I would change nothing.
Nor would I.
We are the lucky ones.
Yanko. Yanko!
Why did you leave him?
Did you not listen to a word I said?
Why did you let him die?
All he wanted was a drink of water.
Just water!
<i>That brave adventurer, who had</i>
<i>crossed a gulf to love her,</i> -
- <i>lay cold and lifeless in her arms. </i>
Yet Amy Foster uttered not a word.
Now that he is no longer before her
eyes to excite her imagination, -
- her memory of him
seems to have vanished, -
- as a shadow passes from a screen.
I have asked myself, is his image
as utterly gone from her mind -
- as his lithe and striding figure
is gone from our fields?
Doctor! Doctor Kennedy,
how can you say that?
How could you even think it?
A man like you!
Did you not have
your own family once?
That was many lifetimes ago,
Miss Swaffer.
So, you have wiped your own
shadows from the screen?
Did your own love blind you to hers?
You carry more for all of us
than any one man should.
You will take care for them,
won't you?
Thank you, Miss Swaffer...
...for our conversation.
Amy... hello.
Amy...
I have wronged you.
Grievously.
And I have no excuse.
Will you forgive me?
Who will forgive me?
I do.
I do... as did he.
I will love him
until the end of the world.
Mama, look at me!
Come out here.
Mama!
<i>Looking at her now,</i> -
- <i>I know why he was cast out by the</i>
<i>sea to die on this hostile shore. </i>
<i>He came across the world</i>
<i>to love and be loved by Amy Foster. </i>
