It worked once,
but obviously it's-- it's still a prototype
so there's-- there's bound to be glitches.
A few false starts.
Never apologize for your work.
You've earned your stripes.
April.
New Dawn is ready and waiting.
If this works...
we'll be making history.
Connors' hard drive's encrypted,
nearly there.
Please don't tell me I broke
into Connors' lab for nothing.
Okay, I'm in.
What is it, what's he doing.
Anomaly readings?
What is it Jess?
You wouldn't believe where
this anomaly is.
Try me.
Connor! Open up.
It's a direct order.
What have you done?
Love it.
How about congratulations...
no?
This is the first man made
anomaly in history and...
I made that.
Lock it.
I suggest you turn around and
leave this lab immediately.
Because under no circumstances is
anyone going to lock this anomaly.

Philip we have to do our job.
Matt, if we lock this anomaly now
the readings just get weaker.
We might lose it altogether.
Oh and that would be bad.
What?
Come on Abby, it's--it's perfectly
safe. Look at the size of it.
You couldn't even get a T-Rex's
toe through there.
I know what I'm doing.
No you don't.
You really really don't.
This lab belongs to Prospro.
It's not your jurisdiction Matt.
If I have to eject you, I will.
Okay.
Abby it's okay, I'll talk
to you later.
What?
Philip knows what he's doing.
Come on.
You two seem to know what your
at so... let's leave it unlocked
and I'll increase security, yeah?
Philip. These results
are incredible.
You have to come over here.
April I'm on my way.
After you.
Sure.
Secure the room.
Sorry I should have been cool
back there. I wasn't thinking.
Locking that anomaly's not
enough.
With Connors machine they can
open another and another...
Then we destroy it.
But Philip will know it was us.
So? It doesn't matter anymore.
We'll have won.
Its sending data some where's else.
This is bigger than just Connors lab.
Power station.
Let me talk to Connor again.
If he shuts it down Philip won't suspect
a thing and then we can deal with it.
Do you think he'll still
listen to you?
I don't know.
But I got to give it one
last try.
Okay.
I need to talk to Connor.
Listen I don't wanna fight.
I just want to know why it's so important
for Philip to open his own anomaly.
Surely you can tell me
now Connor.
Okay.
This whole thing, Abby, has been
about energy.
Free, green, infinitely renewable
energy.
You know harnessing the anomaly in
a controlled environment
that's the key. That could be the
answer to the world's energy crisis.
There are wars going on right
now over energy.
And shortages that cause economies
to collapse.
We can end all that
because Philip's going to
give the energy away
completely free.
Nobody makes a profit from this.
You shouldn't be messing
with nature like this.
We don't understand enough
about the anomalies.
Scientists are <i>always</i>
messing with nature,
it's what we do, it's-- it's called
progress.
You know what I think?
What?
You kept this secret cause deep
down you felt you were doing wrong.
No I... I'm not doing.
This is exactly why I
didn't tell you before.
I knew all this stuff would
just go over your head.
I didn't mean that the way it
sounded.
This isn't about us.
I know that.
That thing's dangerous and
we need to shut it down.
What would Cutter say if
he could see you now?
He would never put people
in danger for the sake of research.
Cutter was a scientist. Just
like Philip.
- He wanted to change the future.
- No he didn't.
He really didn't Connor.
That's what Helen wanted.
Matt look at this.
Something come through?
What is that?
Oh.
Disgusting.
No.
Insects. Gross.
Come on.
Matt it's ok, he put
it back through.
That's the last thing
he should have done.
- We've gotta get him out.
- No. Too late.
******
Incursion detected.
Lockdown procedure initiated...
evacuate.
The beatles must have set off
the bioscan. That's a good thing
The labs an isolation room.
Suck the air out of the room
and kill them.
No it won't. It's got oxygen coming
through your anomaly.
Evacuate. Evacuate.
Hey.
We need to get on to Lester
and tell him this is not a drill.
Emily.
You should leave with the rest
of the non essential staff.
- Who's he calling non essential?
- Look.
It was an unfortunate choice of words,
but he's got a point
and it is his call. I'm sorry.
What do we do not?
Once we've evacuated the Arc
we'll pump pesticide into the lab.
Kill as many as we can before
we lock the anomaly, yeah.
Get him out of here
as soon as possible.
Lockdown.
Lockdown.
Lockdown complete.
Wait Matt.
Is it just my imagination or
are there less of them?
They must be going back
through the anomaly.
Or they're getting out some
other way.
That's impossible. That rooms
sealed tight.
Matt.
Those walls are reinforced
concrete.
They're in the air
conditioning ducts.
That means they're going to
be all over the building in minutes.
Yeah.
Matt.
Ah.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
- You're sure.
- Yeah.
What now.
We scared 'em off?
What's that?
It's the queen.
Hey.
Matt.
Fill me in.
Well we can't pick them
off separately
because they'll be outside
the Arc before we get them all.
But the good news is they
won't leave the queen.
There's some other *** in the docks
we can track their movements in there
and hit them all together. Our only
chance is to get them together.
Jess what's directly under us
on the floor below?
Directly under you is...
is me.
You're right over the hub.
Jess can you get me up a map
of the docks please?
Okay.
Becker, Abby, go to the armory
and get me something
big enough to trap and
hold the queen.
Then bring back as much
pesticide as you can carry.
Okay.
Sorry.
What about me. What--What
can I do?
Jess any sign of those maps?
Got them.
Okay where does the
duct above me go.
It runs right around
the ops room.
Then where.
There's a junction. It splits
into two smaller pipes.
That's perfect. That's too
small for the queen.
Okay Connor make yourself useful.
Get down there and take a panel off
the ceiling. Expose that junction
then wait for me, okay?
- I'm gonna lock the anomaly.
- No you're not. You've done enough already.
I've given you a job now maybe this
time you'll do what I suggest.
Connor if we're not there when that
colony hits that dead end
they're gonna chew through that
duct and we'll have lost
our only chance okay?
Now go. I'll lock the
anomaly.
They're quicker than
I thought.
Come on.
- Don't shoot.
- What the hell?
- I gave you a direct order.
- I know. I just thought you were wrong.
I assume this is what you are looking
for. There are plenty more back here.
What are you waiting for?
Come help me.
We really need a clearer chain
of command around here.
I hate insects. Worse than spiders,
worse than dinosaurs.
Here's your charge.
Thanks.
Listen.
Matt I know how you must
feel about me right now but...
it's just that machine is the most
important thing I've ever worked on.
I never thought that anybody'd
get hurt.
You think that was bad...
it hasn't even started yet.
It's Philip. He must have found
out that you locked the anomaly.
- I'll deal with him in a bit.
- Come on.
- Where do you want the box.
- Right there.
Here.
- She disobeyed a direct order.
- Yeah. Get used to it.
They'll eat through this fast.
It won't hold them for long.
Long as we get one or two minutes
out of it that should be enough.
Matt.... they're coming.
Okay we need this thing.
Nobody fire until I say. We have
to spray all of them, no stragglers.
And whatever happens don't
kill the queen.
Why not?
Ready?
- Ready.
- Go.
Now?
Now!
Jess.
Don't stop, don't stop.
It's not working.
Jess Jess.
- I'm out.
- Now I'm out too.
Okay move, move.
Go go.
Come on keep moving.
They got the queen out.
That was our only way
of controling them.
Now what are you doing.
Jess.
Jess.
What's wrong with you?
I feel weird.
She's burning up.
Abby didn't you get bitten too?
One of them bit my wrist but I feel
okay. They can't be venomous.
No you don't understand. I'm
alergic to insect bites.
I need an epi pen. There should
be some in the medical bay.
Here.
I'll take her.
Okay. Emily, Abby cover
Becker.
Connor...
answer that phone and tell
Philip exactly what's going on here.
I'll fix this.
I'll make this right.
Philip.
What the hell is going
on there?
Why have we lost the data
feed to the anomaly.
Yeah we had to go into lockdown.
We've got a serious incursion of
prehistoric beetles here.
I know that because the bioscan
has been triggered but that does not
explain what happened
to the <i>feed</i>!
We had to lock the anomaly.
Philip the guard you left here...
he's been killed. Jess got bitten
and she's in a really bad way.
Connor I know things are difficult right
now but I need you to unlock
that anomaly as soon
as possible.
Did you not hear what I said?
A man's dead.
The beetles are all over the Arc. They
managed to tunnel their way out of my lab.
Wait.
Are you telling me that they've
managed to burrow their way
through reinforced concrete?
Yeah they tore through
that wall in minutes.
Philip I'm gonna have to go.
Connor
Shall I call Prospro?
Yes. Under no circumstance is that
lockdown to be lifted without my say so.
Do you understand?
Okay what'd he say?
Oh... he's a bit distracted
at the minute.
What?
Well I'm all out of ideas mate
so it's your turn.
We need something to deal with the
whole Arc. Can we electrocute them?
Use sonar?
Haven't got the
equipment for that.
It's um...
There is something.
What?
Follow me.
Hey.
Come on you're doing
really well there.
Not far now.
How are you feeling?
Insect bite ***
Shhh...
Here Emily.
Come on.
What was that?
They've developed a taste for
the wiring.
Yeah that's not good news.
What's the plan?
I'm going to open my anomaly.
Recalibrate it to send out a pulse
of Gamma rays. That should
wipe out all the beetles at once.
That'll kill everything in the Arc.
Never said it was a perfect plan.
Here's fine.
Okay thanks.
- You okay?
- Yeah thanks.
Becker!
Carbohydrate gel, electrolytes.
Much tastier than walls
and wiring.
There's no adrenaline.
Jess you must have your own
epi pen.
Yeah in the car but with all these
medical things I've never brought it in.
If we open these sealed doors
that's it. There's no controling them.
We need to get her to a hospital.
You keep the beetles in the ARC
you've a chance of wiping them out.
Yeah and if we don't get you adrenaline...
We have to take the risk.
Philip has to lift lockdown.
Back to the loading bay exit.
I'll meet you there.
Right. Come on.
You okay?
It's all clear.
- We've lost power in here.
- We'll think of something else.
Hang on.
We still have power.
Strange.
See this--this doesn't. It...
This is not beetle damage.
We've got reports of electricity problems
in 80% of the ARC.
That means these creatures
must be nearly out.
These things will breed.
We're talking about a plague.
We can't risk New Dawn.
Not now.
Philip.
There is one decisive way of
dealing with the threat.
What you're doing here...
It's going to change the whole planet.
If it comes to it...
isn't that worth the sacrifice.
Might be able to retrieve
some data from here.
Just forget about it Connor.
It doesn't make any sense.
This looks like it's been...
been blasted by an EMB
You did this.
What?
Was locking it not enought Matt? Do you
not know how important all this work is?
We don't have enough time for this.
We need to come up with a workable plan.
I had a plan.
A Gamma ray would have
killed everyone Connor.
There's no adrenaline left
in the building.
Get Philip to lift lockdown or
Jess is gonna die.
Connor.
Philip we need to get
Jess to a hospital... now.
I'm afraid that's impossible. We can't
afford to breach the integrity of the ARC.
Philip Jess could die.
If these beetles get out
thousands could die.
Oh so what's the plan then?
You gonna just leave us in here?
We predict that these beetles will be
through the outer wall within 10 minutes.
That's the time limit.
There is another way to neutralize this
threat given the whole city is at risk.
Tell us what it is Philip.
An auto destruct program was built
into the ARC operating system.
If activated the ARC
and everything in it
will be incinerated.
The radiation from the Gamma ray, would
it penetrate lead?
Depends on how thick it is.
Would we be safe
in the panic room?
Well maybe but... why are we even talking
about this. We can't do it you
fried my hard drive.
Remember?
If you had a back up hard drive
could you restart the anomaly?
Matt.
Well I don't have a backup hard drive.
April said it was a security risk.
Where you going?
What's going on?
Your hero is prepared to kill you
and all of us, that's what's going on.
Through here.
How you feeling?
I've felt worse, but at least there was
tequila and dancing involved.
We need to get this fever down.
I need drinking water and a cloth.
Have a look in the car.
How did he get in here?
I don't know.
Abby locked him in the lab.
Yeah.
That's directly above us. If he can get
down here so can the beetles.
Nice work.
Who let the tigers in here
anyway?
What?
Becker cold water.
Quick let's get her in
the car first.
We copied your hard drive.
I don't understand.
So you were in my lab.
Is this what it's come down to.
You two just sneaking around
and plotting against me?
We had to.
You wouldn't listen to me.
We'll deal with this later.
Right now you've got work to do.
Matt. Abby. Can you here me?
The coms are down. Where
the hell is Abby.
- We need to get Jess out of here now.
- I'm sure they're working on it.
Get them off me. Get them
off me.
Your fine.
Come here, come here.
I'm so cold.
- I'm so cold.
- I know come here.
You've got a fever.
Here.
You need to drink this.
That's an order.
You're mean you know that.
Yes I do know that. I'm very
mean. Now drink this.
Here.
- I hate you.
- No you don't.
Shhh.
I'm sorry.
You're nice really.
You've got lovely hair.
And that you are...
Jess.
Emily.
Pulse is getting weaker
and weaker.
What was that?
No sign of beetles.
Once the anomaly's been reopened
Connors gonna collapse it.
Basically send it's
energy into reverse.
Like when you lock an anomaly.
Way way more intense than that.
The pressure'll be so great it will
produce a great blast of energy.
Gamma radiation.
And that'll kill them?
Yeah that should do the trick.
If it works.
It'll be like an explosion ripping though
the ARC. Any living thing that's not in
the panic room will be
whipped out.
Abby what about the creatures?
Well the cells are lead lined.
They'll be okay.
As okay as us anyway.
Right I better get the others
to the panic room.
What about you two?
Once this is open there'll be time
for us to get there.
Is that true?
This isn't some noble
sacrifice Armageddon thing where
you blow yourselves up
to save the rest of us?
Well I hope not.
If I'm honest.
Good.
We'll be fine.
Go.
Emily this way.
We're losing her.
It'll be okay.
Connor and Matt will get us out.
Rex.
- He's still in my lab.
- Abby he's not. He got out.
What.
I gotta find him.
Abby no!
Abby!
Was that true?
Is there time?
Not sure.
But if we don't try this
then everybody dies.
So what are we lookin at here
50-50?
60-40. I can live with those odds.
Let's just say it's... better than
winning the jackpot in the National Lottery.
That's like 10 million to one.
Yeah. I did say better than.
Well if you're not in it
you can't win it.
Got three minutes.
- We're nearly there.
- Good.
What's that?
I'm sorry Connor.
I have no choice.
Philip whatever you've done
cancel it.
I need one more minute
I'm nearly there.
Think what would happen
if they got out.
To homes
hospitals
to schools...
And to New Dawn you mean. Philip please.
Just give us 30 more seconds.
Will he abort it?
Rex.
Rex.
- You ready?
- Connor.
At least the others will be safe.
I'm not dying in here mate.
Rex.
Rex!
Connor I have an idea.
Is the water pump system
still intact.
It should be.
You good?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Oh well then.
Rex.
Rex.
Rex we don't have time.
Where the hell are they?
Where's Abby?
She went to find Rex.
- No.
- Connor.
Rex.
Abby!
Abby.
Abby.
Oh, thank God.
Got him.
- Abby about...
- Connor we've really gotta go.
Okay.
We're still alive?
Don't sound so surprised.
I always knew the
plan would work.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Becker wait. We don't
know if it's safe yet.
She needs adrenaline.
See, I did it.
He aborted the program.
Cause if he hadn't we'd all
be burned alive by now.
Yeah.
They did it. They destroyed
the beetles.
Lift the lockdown.
Come on Philip. Come on
what are you waiting for.
Five, four, three, two one.
Her pulse is getting stronger.
Hey.
I'm gon- I'm gonna- I'm gonna
go do some security stuff.
Hey.
Everything alright?
Apart from the whole near
death experience thing.
What's wrong.
I had to check, I had
to be sure.
What?
The beetles must have chewed through
the wiring so the failsafe didn't work.
Philip did it.
He ran the incineration program.
He was gonna kill us all.
Philip.
The man of the moment.
You've pulled it off
again. Well done.
Thank you.
Connor.
You're all right.
We were so worried.
You uh-- you able to get any data
from the anomaly before the...
Oh, we did indeed. In fact we've
made huge leaps foreword.
We're about to go and check over changes to
the hardware now. Do you want to come.
No. No. I'm fine. I just came
by to say "Thank you" really.
For a moment there I thought
you were going to incinerate us all.
You do understand my
position don't you?
I mean everything we do at
the ARC is for the greater good.
Protecting the public
comes first.
I understand.
It's the same with New Dawn.
Ah. Jack I'll be right with you.
Yes sir.
Oh, I should let you get on with
your work. Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow then.
Pleasant day.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Helen.
I've seen the future Philip
and I know.
Our hopes rest on you.
You'll find a way.
You must.
The future is in your hands.
I should have listened to you.
It's just I felt like I was carrying
on Cutters work,
and that he might
be proud of me.
Somehow
Do you think Philip
still trusts you?
Yeah.
And I'm willing to do anything--
anything I can to make this right.
But there's something
I need to tell you.
The machine I made...
in my lab.
It's just a prototype. Philip
built another one.
It's a hundred times
it's size,
and it's infinitely more
powerful and now
he's got the key.
And he knows how to open his
anomaly because I showed him how.
It's too late.
There's no way we
can stop him now.
