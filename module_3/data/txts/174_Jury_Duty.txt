             Hey.
                Hi.
    Let's go back
    to my place and curdle.
                     Eww!
                 Ugh! Go!
  Okay, boys,
  the votes are in.
 Read it and weep.
  I made it, I made it.
                      Congrats.
 We're gonna be dancers.
               Let me through.
 I'm gonna call Mother.
   "Adonis, Thor, Sgt. O'Tool,
   Goliath, Zeus, the Cream..."
                Huh?
                     Excuse me.
             I don't understand
             what happened.
             I mean, I was good, right?
 Kid, you were too good.
         But I got personality!
       Personality?
 Unfortunately, uh, that's not what
 the people are paying for.
 A kid like you, you're special.
 You could do anything.
 What about fast foods?
               It's too greasy.
      Post office?
               Too dangerous.
 You ever fill in potholes?
           Too labor-intensive.
 What about giving sperm?
      Also too labor-intensive.
 Yeah, you're right.
        Well, thanks for trying
        to hook me up here
           at the International Beefcake House,
           Uncle Sal.
 Hey, what's family for, huh?
 Get over here.
 Huh? Who loves you more than your Uncle Sal?
 All right, goodbye.
        Personality!
             Oh, well, Peanut,
           some things just aren't meant to be.
           What else is there?


              "We pay big bucks for your dog.
          "Animal Lab Testing Corporation."

       Don't worry, Peanut,
       I wouldn't do that to you again.


       <i> Right behind me,</i>
       <i> Carl Wayne Bishop,</i>
<i> the accused Drive-Thru Killer,</i>
<i> sits alone</i>
  <i> in his 6 by 8 solitary cell.</i>
    <i> Coincidentally, the cell is roughly the size of</i>
    <i> his old workspace.</i>
  <i> But there are no burgers,</i>
  <i> no fries, no frosty shakes.</i>
 <i> Just an accused serial killer and his conscience,</i>
 <i> awaiting trial by jury.</i>
     <i> 12 brave citizens</i>
     <i> riding shotgun for...</i>
                Wakey, wakey.
                Eggs and bacey.
       Rise and shine, puddin'.
                Wake up, Tommy.
     Mom, it's not noon yet.
             Oh, I brewed you some fresh coffee.
  Uh.
 But, Mom, that'll keep me up all day.
       Puddin', tell me, what happened
       with your job interview?
   I must have been fast asleep
   when you came in.
        What job interview?
          The one at the dairy.
 Well, Mom, it didn't really happen.
 I didn't get the job.
       Ah.
     That's all right, puddin'.
     It's okay.
             It's dangerous being a milkman.
 I saw a whole program on it
 on cable television.
      I'll find something, Ma.
      You just don't worry.
 Oh, look no further,
 Mr. District Attorney.
            What's this?
            A jury duty notice?
   My son, the lawyer.
               Ma, it pays $5 a day, okay?
           Look, look at me.
           I got stuff to do.
         Yes, but...
 I heard that
 when the trial is important,
 they sequester
 the jury in very posh hotels.
              Hey, Ma, what could be better than this?

 Tommy, you just threw away
 your entire future.
 Mom, honey-face, snookum-pie,
 I'll find something.
       <i> Hear ye, hear ye!</i>
        Hey, Ma, look!
    <i> Harry the Hot Tub King</i>
    <i> is slashing all prices.</i>
            <i> That's right.</i>
       <i> The widest selection.</i>
       <i> I demand it.</i>
          <i> The finest...</i>
                Hey, Mom, look.
                Safe sex.

                      Oh, I...
     I have to finish dressing.

 Hey, Jed.
                   Hi.
            I got two words
            for you, son.
            Polystyrene.
   It's like white gold, Tommy.
   It's everywhere.
           People are throwing this stuff away,
	   right and left,
   treating it like the plague.
   But south of the border,
   they can't get enough of it.
         So, here's what we do.
          We find it, clean it,
          ship it. Bingo.
           Easy village, huh?
 Right.
      Come here, I want to show
      you something. Come on.
   Look. Look, what do you see?
 A truck full of shit.
             No, Tommy.
             That's the future.
         This stuff
         is light as a feather.
    And the best part of it is,
    they pay you by the pound.
 Wow! Then you must
 be making a fortune.
                    Yeah.
        Ta da! I'm ready.
            Where are we going?
      Uh, Vegas.
            Oh, great!
            Peanut loves craps.
         Siegfried and Peanuts.
 You didn't tell him?
   I knew there was
   something I forgot.
            Okay, you guys,
            we are ready.
            Tommy, um...
        Your mom and I are going to Las Vegas
        to get married.
             Alone.

 Wait a minute.
 Where are you guys gonna stay?
        Honey, we'll be back
        before you know it.
        It's gonna be a very quick honeymoon,
        right, Jed?
 But, Mom, where will Peanut and I eat,
 sleep, and watch TV?
         They're gonna take
         very good care of you.
            I made arrangements for you to stay
            at the Woodalls.
                  Bye, puddin'.

    The Woodalls?
           Oh.
       Come on, Tommy.
       We won't hurt you.


 Court is in session.
           Thanks for the ride,
           Uncle Morty.
            Say hi
            to your mom for me.
    Whoa! Look
    at that erect building.
            Okay, Peanut.
            Take a deep breath.
        Remember, we go
        to different courtrooms
   until they find the trial
   that's right for us.
          And the trial that's right for us
          is a very long one
       where we get to stay in a hotel for free,
       not to mention $5 a day.
          You got that, Peanut?

         <i> Hola, senorita.</i>
 It's, uh,
 pretty impressive, eh?
                 Yeah, S and M.

                       Kinky.
 You here for jury duty?
                 Oh, yeah. You?
  I couldn't get out of it, at least not yet.
  Give me a hand.
          Just around the head?
    I'm kind of
    faking a head wound.
 Excuse me. Are you two here for jury duty?
                         Yeah!
              Yeah.
 You couldn't
 get out of it?
          At least not yet.
      I'm still trying, though.
 I know.
                Hey, look,
                it's the juice!
                Run, O.J., run!
                           Ahh!
       It was a security guard.
 Hey, maybe I can help you.
                     Yeah?
 Yeah. I got an idea.
    <i> "The People</i>
    <i> versus Robert Trenton."</i>
    The defendant is accused
    of embezzling $2,000.
   This trial shouldn't last
   more than a day or two.
      Three days at most.
    Bob, is that you?
    Who's this?
        I don't know who he is.
   Bobby Trenton?
     You know the defendant?
     Know him?
 We cheated our way through high school together,
 didn't we, Bobby?
 Remember we had that thing
 with the hands, right here.
  Then when we put
  the thing on the...
 And you slammed...
 It hurt your right there.
            Excused.
   This trial should
   move quite swiftly.
  Dr. Maurice Gaines,
  an orthopedic surgeon
    has been accused
    of malpractice.
         Murderer!
    I don't know.
    I mean, call me crazy,
     but I believe a man has the right
     to protect his family.
 Say hello to Manson for me.
      Ee-eee-eee!
           You're out of order!
       No, you're out of order!
               This whole court
               is out of order!
         Bring him in.

        Order! Order!
    The defendant,
    Carl Wayne Bishop
 is accused of
 multiple counts of murder.
 This trial will be a very long
 and involved one.
 If you are selected
 as a juror,
 you will be
 sequestered in a hotel.
 Unfortunately,
 your lives will be disrupted.
 Your relationships and jobs
 will have to be put on hold.
 It will be a true test
 of your commitment
 to our judicial system.
    Mr. Collins,
 do you have any preconceived notions
 about the Drive-Thru Killer?
               Drive-Thru who?
 Don't tell me you've never heard
 of Carl Wayne Bishop?
    No, I can't say I have.
    I'm not one for television.
              Poisons the mind.
              It's too biased.
        Nobody tells the truth.
             And quite frankly,
             the truth,
             well, that's all
             I'm interested in.
      They picked a jury!
      They picked a jury!

          Tuna salad for lunch!
 The jury for
 this highly-charged
 and sensitive murder trial
 has been chosen.
  Presently, the jurors
  are departing the courthouse
  for an undisclosed location.
   Sir, over here! Do you know
   where they are taking you?
     Will you be allowed
     to see your families?
  Did you try the tuna salad?
    Fear not, citizens.
    Justice will be served.
   You're in good hands! Aah!
        Ow!
  What? I had the exact change.
    Sit down.

 All right,
 ladies and gentlemen,
 welcome to your hotel.
 When you're not here,
 you'll be in the courtroom.
 When not in the courtroom,
 you'll be here.
 Please do not
 discuss any aspect
   of the trial with each other
   or anyone else.
            That means friends,
            family, the media.
 What about
 Ricki Lake?
  Welcome to the Holiday Suites Hotel,
  where every day is a holiday.
          Eh, pretty nice joint
          you got here.
          Beautiful, beautiful.
    Actually, you'll be staying
    in the historic wing.

      The emergency exits are at the end
      of the hallways.
 And the ice machine is located just across
 the street at the gas station.
     You'll be staying
     two to a vintage suite.
        Jurors 7 and 12,
        in suite 503.
                       I'm 12.
                 I'm 7.
     And, let's see,
     we have jurors 2 and 9
                  in suite 504.
 What are you doing?
            We're bunkies, see?
         9?
 Move it, pervert.
 Good night.
  Wait, wait. No, no, no.
  Don't shut it. Don't shut it.
                    Ahh!

       Peanut, look. Huh?
       We just died
       and went to heaven.
             Oh, my.
                    Oh, look.
                       Oh!
          Peanut-size shampoos.
 All these fun things

            Two-ply.

 Oh, my God!
          Something wrong, son?
 Principal Beasely.
                 Good grief.
           Mr. Collins?
           In a suit and tie?
    I didn't do it!
    I didn't do it!
      Still hanging out
      in the boys' room, I see.
             Sit down, Collins!
 If this isn't one of
 life's supreme ironies.
            Didn't I expel you?
            Twice.
                 I thought so.
               What is it, son?
       May I be excused?
                Very well.
 Oh, pleasant dreams,
 Mr. Collins.
 I know that's
 what you majored in.

         I am no one's doormat.
                 All rise.
 Department Number 52 of the Superior Court
 is now in session.
 The Honorable Judge Edward J. Powell presiding.
         Ladies and
         gentlemen of the jury,
            here are the facts.
       Seven innocent men dead.
      Seven families destroyed.
            Seven lives wasted.
          All courtesy of
          Mr. Carl Wayne Bishop
  and a stun gun, Model 350-X.
 As the case unfolds,
 we will show
 Carl Wayne Bishop
      to be in possession
      not only of a stun gun,
    but also a lethal
         red-hot temper.
   <i> We will show that because</i>
   <i> of his employment record,</i>
         <i> getting a job</i>
      <i> became as difficult</i>
      <i> as holding a job.</i>
     And as a consequence,
     Mr. Bishop ended up on the streets.
     <i> And finally, we will show</i>
     <i> that Carl Wayne Bishop</i>
        <i> was found living</i>
        <i> in a boarded-up,</i>
        <i> condemned shack,</i>
        <i> with a stun gun</i>
 <i> and the bodies of seven fast-food managers</i>
 <i> buried in the floorboards.</i>

   <i> The Defense will contend</i>
   <i> that Mr. Bishop was set up.</i>
       <i> That he was merely</i>
       <i> a harmless drifter</i>
       <i> who happened to be in the wrong place</i>
       <i> at the wrong time.</i>
    <i> Who never actually lived</i>
    <i> in the condemned house</i>
       <i> but was there for</i>
       <i> a job interview.</i>
         <i> At 9:30 at night?</i>
   <i> In the worst neighborhood</i>
   <i> in town?</i>
            <i> Please.</i>
      <i> The Defense can</i>
      <i> contend all it wants,</i>
  <i> but the evidence will show</i>
  <i> Mr. Bishop to be a calculating,</i>
             <i> cold,</i>
       <i> killing machine,</i>
 who knew exactly where he was
 and what he was doing.

              All rise!
           Moron.

              Thanks for
              saving me a seat.

         So, what do you think?
 About what?
 Your sleeping or your drooling?
       We all have our own ways
       of concentrating.
                Honestly, do you think
                the guy did it?
 I don't think
 we're allowed to discuss that.
      Then what can we discuss?
           Us?
                        Uh-huh.
        Nothing.
            Whoa, boy, ease up.
           You're like a fly swimming in
           a barrel of pickles.
        You got to cut wood before
        you can shave its bark.
                Think about it.
                Think about it.
 Write her a note?
                  There you go!
     Ladies and gentlemen
     of the jury,
     clearly, whoever committed
     these horrible atrocities
             is a savage beast.
      In fact, we have no proof
       that these crimes were even committed
       by a human being at all.
      You know, I've seen some pretty
      smart animals in my time.
 I've seen a chicken
 play the piano.
    And the gibbon?
   Everyone forgets
   it has a thumb.
 Indulge me, if you will.
 "Disturbing the peace, loitering, shoplifting,
                "armed robbery,
                    "burglary,
          "impersonating a U.S. forest ranger,
      "receiving stolen goods."
         These are all crimes  Carl Wayne Bishop
         has been arrested for.
              Petty crimes.
         A far cry from murder,
         wouldn't you say?
                As we all know,
                 Shit.
                  killing a man
                  is not easy.
     It'd be safe to say there are not many killers
     among us.
                Hopefully none.
     It takes persistence
     and determination to kill.
         Why, just last spring,
         I found two mice in my garage,
  and I had the darndest time
  killing those little suckers.
          Isn't it then logical
          that an unfocused,
             misdirected youth,
             such as my client
              would never have
              the get-up-and-go
     that it would take to
     stun, strangle and dispose
          of the bodies of
          seven full-grown men?
              Carl Wayne Bishop
              is an angry man,
              but not a killer.
     For lack of a better word,
               he's a screw-up.
 Objection, Your Honor.
  You can't object.
  This is my opening statement.
            Counsel will
            approach the bench.
 A gibbon?
 A chicken who can play piano?
 Calling his client
 "a screw-up."
 This is a waste
 of taxpayer's money.
            What in God's name
            are you doing here?
        Your Honor,
   I don't think it's fair
   that you guys get to have
   your own little powwow over here,
   while we can't listen.
   We have to hear, too,
   for information.
               You're a juror.
          Get back in that box!
    trying to do my job.
             Number 6, come on.
               Back in the box.
       You are in trouble.

 Hold down the fort, Peanut.
 It's time to take action.



              Ahh!


        Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
              Sorry.

          Hi!
           Can I help you, sir?
 Hah! Yes!
 I'm in room 505. I need
 to switch rooms, please?
                    Oh, okay.
                 Oh, oh, uh...
      Mr. Collins, I'm sorry.
      You're one of the jurors.
              Unfortunately,
              I can't move you.
     Those are
     especially assigned rooms.
 That's ridiculous!
 I can't sleep.
 Look, see the luggage
 under these eyes?
 Huh? Do you see?
 Look. Look. Look.
 You got glasses on.
 Take a look. Luggage.
 Luggage. Louis Vuitton.
 How do you expect me
 to render a fair verdict?
 Do you realize
 that there's a man's life
 that hangs
 in the balance here?
          I'm afraid
          it's out of my hands.

 "I'm not your doormat!
 I can accomplish my goals!
 "Turn the tape over, now!"
   I wish there was some way
   we could work something out,
    but I'm afraid there isn't.
            Three more
            cancellations, sir.
   The renovations are causing more disturbance
   than we figured.
    Any more of these
    and I'll lose my shirt.
           And that lovely tie.
 Russell, old buddy, old pal.
 I think I have an idea.
              When can we expect a verdict?
         I cannot say.
       Any word on the verdict?
          No comment.
                     A verdict?

 Dr. Brookings,
 as the preeminent expert on the psychology
 of serial killers,
      tell me,
 why would a man choose to live under the same roof
 as his victims,
 amidst his own personal killing field,
 as it were?
   It's quite simple, actually.
        It all boils down
        to an issue of control,
         which at its
         most basic human level
              can be attributed
              to penis envy.
    By having these dead bodies
    buried in his living room,
        clearly
        there's some kind of...
 Is something the matter,
 Juror Number 6?
    Yes, actually, I didn't get that last bit.
    What was it attributed to?
   Dr. Brookings?
                Penis envy.
             Excuse me,
             what kind of envy?
                   Penis.
         I'm sorry,
         I couldn't hear the...
                   Penis.
                Just once more.
 Penis! Penis! Penis!

 After Mr. Bishop was fired,
    what did you
    overhear him say?
                 He said,
        "I'm gonna kill you."
          He said, "Your days
          are numbered, matey."
         He said,
         "Your ass is tabouli."

                 I...
            I saw him stab...
       Stab a weenie and say,
      "I wish it were you."



 No further questions.

                     Hey!
 Have a good night, guys.
 We're going to bigger and better places,
 my friend.

      We should've just handed our verdict

 At least we'll

 Oh, yes, dinner, followed

 That boy's guiltier than a possum

 If you need anything,
 I'll be right outside the door.

              Let's vote.
 Why waste our time?
 Let's just walk back in there
 and tell the judge
 to light him up.
                 Excuse me,
                 do you mind?
    Yes, there're enough
    poisons in the air already,
           thank you very much.
 My sincerest apologies.
 Here, 20% off any hot tub or spa.
 Well, I think the correct thing to
 do is to take a vote.
          Yeah, yeah, whatever, let's just get this
          over with.
           Good idea. A vote.
 All those in favor of taking a bathroom break,
 raise their hands.
                 You pee
                 after we vote.
 It's a free country.
 Jorge has a right to pee.
  That's right.
                Sit down.
        Okay.
 Look, well, I gotta go.

              Take a seat, boy.
      Yeah, come on, kid.
              Forget it.
              I have to tinkle.
        Will you just hurry up?
                I'm hurrying!

   What the hell is that boy

              Making a pee-pee?
 Reminds me of my honeymoon
 in Niagara Falls.

 Come on, boy, zip it!
        I'm almost done.
 Maybe while he finishes,
 we should elect
 a jury foreman.
   To tell that psycho lunatic he's
   going to the electric chair?
              Not me, oh, no.
              Oh, no, no.
 It'll be like
 sentencing Satan himself.
 He'll give you that
 evil eye.
 It will haunt you

 the supernatural powers to kill you.
 I'm out.
            Well, then who?

          Ahh!
           What?
     Congratulations, kid,
     it's your lucky day.
  What, I didn't get
  any on me?
                   No.
          You've just been
          elected jury foreman.

 We thought you were
 the best man for the job.
                    Wow!
        This is truly an honor.
        First of all, I'd like to thank
        Principal Beasely, sir,
        for that
        strong scholastic base.
        And, Nathan, <i> malaka salaam,</i>
        brother, my man.
      And, Monica,
      my legal beagle.
       And, Harry...
                Oh, shut up
                and let's vote!
          Right now?
       Yes, right now!
     Yeah, but you guys just elected me
     jury foreman.
       I say it's time for
       a little fiesta!
                  No. Vote now!
       Yeah, now.
      On an empty stomach?
           Yes, goddamn it,
           on an empty stomach!
    It's a simple "guilty."
    That's it.
   That's it?
   And what about the baby?
                What baby?
     Sarah's pregnant.
     She's eating for two.
           If we arrive
           at a verdict now,
           it'll be at least
           a half hour
   before they call the judge,
   if he's available and sober.
 Then there's local TV,
 interviews, <i> Nightline...</i>

 We're liable not to eat for
 a couple more days at least.
 Uh, you know,
 I think he's right.
     And that is
     why you elected me
     jury foreman.

                  Yeah.
               Have you reached
               a verdict?
      Yes, we have.
Chinese.


   I almost got it.
   I just got a little more.
    Take it home with you, boy.
    Let's vote.
    On a full stomach?
          Yes, goddamn it,
          on a full stomach.
 I believe the rule is,
 no voting until 30 minutes after you eat.
        That's swimming,
        you idiot!
 Oh, Principal Beasely,
 what are you doing?
 This stuff is money in the bank.
 This stuff's worth a fortune.
 This right here, guys,
 is our future.
     Our future?
     It's our end.
 That and aerosol cans
 and asbestos,
 and the rest of the crap
 that's poisoning us.
  That's very interesting, okay?
  Can we cut the crap and vote?
             Now?
                  Yes!
       Yes, now.
    Quit stalling.
         Now!
                  Now!
           Now!
      All right, okay, let's just
      get to it right now.
        No sense in wasting
        taxpayers' money.
       Okay, pass it down.
 A secret ballot
 is a waste of time.
                     And paper.
       May I have the honor
       of collecting the votes?
      Yes, you may, Jorge.
             You know,
             in my country,
     a man does not have
     the right to a fair trial.
    This jury system is
    really something wonderful.
         I am so proud.
 Oh, great. Count them.
      Okay, you guys ready?
              Yes.
            "Guilty."
             "Guilty."
              "Guilty."
          That one was
          probably yours.
                     Probably.
            Okay, "Guilty."
              "Guilty."
     Ray, this says "Guilty."
        Now, let me think.
        What do you think this one is?
        This says
        "Guilty," too.
         Okay, "Guilty."
            "Guilty."

            "Guilty."
           Oh, my...
        "Not guilty"?
            What?
 Let me see that!
         Let me see that!
 My! This is unbelievable.
 Which one of you guys did this?
    I am shocked...
                 Mr. Collins!
 Yes, Principal Beasely, sir?
               There is a "u"
               in "not guilty."
 Are you sure?
        I don't believe
        I understood correctly.
  I was thinking about my girl,
  who I haven't seen in four years.
       Did you vote not guilty?
       Yeah.
               How could you...
  And how can you
  vote guilty?
    Goddamn it, Tommy!
    I killed for these tickets.
   If you make me miss the game because of your bullshit,
   I'll be pissed off!
          I'll be very,
          very pissed off!
    Now, wait a second. I believe even Mr. Collins
    has a right to his opinion.
   Maybe we should discuss
   this before he votes guilty.
            Exactly.
 Reasonable doubt.
 Okay, what does this mean?
 We got "reason"
   from the French <i> "raison"</i>
        meaning "dry grape."
        And we got "able"
   from Abraham Lincoln,
   our beloved third president.
       Boy, I'm gonna kill you!
               No!
        Gonna kill you!

 I say we request an alternate and report this slimebucket
 to the Judge.

 This is like being stuck
 on an island with Gilligan!
                      Oh, wait!
                It's worse,
                it's real life.
    Ow, aah! My ear!
     Stop killing time
     and start killing killers!
           Aah!
    In my country, they would've shot
    this Bishop on day one.
   Here, you people
   play games.
            Aah!
     Maybe I don't like
     this country so much.

  Listen, we're all making
  a tremendous sacrifice, okay?
                    Ahh!
               But I don't want to send this guy
               to the chair
               without at least considering all
               the facts.
          I mean, I'm willing to forego
          a little comfort
           in my life so that
           justice can be done.
       Even if it takes a year.
       A year?
 My business is
 going to ruins!

    She's having the baby!
    She's having the baby!
       We're right here, Sarah.
            Back off.
            She needs some air.
     Wait, wait, wait, no.
       It's a false alarm.
       It's okay. It's just the baby kicking.
                Oh, God, I told you she
                was funny. See?
    Do you want to feel it?
    You can feel it.
     Ohh!
              Isn't that great?
                   Oh, wow!

                Don't even
                think about it.
     What did I do?
                  Get away.
               What did you do?
               What did you do?
          Yeah.
                  Everything!
                   Nothing!
               Instead of this poor woman
               being stuck here
            stressing out
            for the past month,
      she should've been in bed
      with her feet up! But no.
            No, because of you,
            we're cooped up in this closet
      away from our families,
      our friends, and our jobs
              headed into
              the 21st century!
          Now, I have supported
          you from day one,
            but now
            I have to agree
            with everyone else.
       If, by tomorrow morning,
       you do not walk
           in here with your
           act pulled together,
        I will personally lead
        a charge to the Judge's chambers
       and have you thrown out.

 Peanut, this isn't funny.

      I just had no idea
      you felt so passionately.
             I guess you know

 Now what are we gonna do?


 Bishop, you got a visitor.
 Your girlfriend's here
 to kiss you goodbye.
             Purr!
            In here.

        No, no, no, no,
        no, look,

    it is. Look, see?
          I like French women.

           Perfect.

                ooh...
        Ah, what a night,
        what a night!
         Hey, everybody.
         Hi!
 Oh, Skeets, would you show me
 a picture of your girlfriend?
 I just want to
 look at her for a sec.

       Oh!
 Yep, this is her.
 You know, she looks
 a lot different
 with her clothes on.
 She is a panther
 in the sack.
       Mmm.

     I'm gonna kill you!


 Hey! What the hell
 is going on here?
    Thank God you're here, Murph.
    Private Skeets is a madman.

       He says
       he wants to kill me.
 Is that so?
            Of course not.
            I was just kidding.
  I'm just a little frustrated,
  that's all.
 Just like
 Carl Wayne Bishop.
   Oh, Murph, while you're here,
   arrest this guy.
             For what?
 He actually killed
 for these.
        Whoa, stay right there,
        Murph, all right?
            It's an expression.
      I say it all the time, okay?
      It doesn't mean anything.
 How do we know
 Carl Wayne Bishop
 actually meant
 what he said?
 How do we know
 it wasn't an expression?
            Morons.
 But Carl Wayne Bishop
 fits the profile of a killer perfectly.
       How is that, Sarah? Huh?
       Because he dresses differently?
            Because he doesn't
            look like you guys?
              Because he can't
              hold down a job?
       Now, wait a minute, now.
       Wait a minute.
        You didn't sleep with
        my girlfriend, did you?

 Monica, how much did the
 steer shack manager weigh?
       Uh, 180 pounds. Why?
 Would you mind participating
 in a little legal experiment?
              Conducted by you,
              Mr. Collins?
           Not at all. In fact,
           I'm rather curious.




 Jorge, you're about the so-called killer's
 weight and height.
        Pick Beasely up and throw him
        on the table.
              Okay, no problem.
          Come on, try it.

             Hernia.
 Rose, you want
 to give it a try?
     Uh, sure.
      Wait. What is your point?
 What's my point?
 I think it's obvious.
 How much did
 Carl Wayne Bishop weigh?
                    130 pounds.
       He could never have lifted
       the steer shack manager.
         Oh, that's ridiculous!
       Why is this so difficult
       to understand?
 Because for the first time
 there's reason to suspect
 that Carl Wayne Bishop
 is telling the truth.
            That he was set up?
       Exactly!
           That's preposterous!
             You guys,
        we're talking about a human being's
        life here. Hello?
    <i> ♪ Head, shoulders, knees</i>
    <i> and toes, knees and toes ♪</i>

             We what?

        I say we give him
        a chance.
        We've come this far.
       Listen, I'll make you
       guys a deal.
          If, by tomorrow,
        you guys still feel
        Bishop is the killer,
        I'll come in, I'll vote guilty
        with the rest of yas.
     Well...

 All right, all right!
                  Tomorrow!
              Thanks.
        Stop the bus! Open the doors!
        Open the doors!
 I think I see something.
               Collins!
             Mr. Collins,
             back to your seat!
            Yeah, come on, kid,
            give it up!
 Come on, let's go!
            Bishop says he was
            knocked out, right?
                         Right.
   Clearly, if the killer knocked out all his
   victims with the stun gun...
      Then he would've done
      the same thing to Bishop.
      Right. And considering
      the stun gun markings
        were on the neck
        and the shoulders...
         It's logical to assume that Bishop would have
         a similar mark.
              Behold.
          Ah!

 How do we know that the
 marks are from a stun gun?
 Yes.
 Simple.
        Wait, wait. Stop that.

           How do we know he didn't have
           those marks forever?
 Come here.
        Don't touch me, please!
                          Look!
       I don't see any stun gun
       markings here, do you?

   Come on, Frank, we can save
   an innocent man's life here.
 Seems logical.

 Tom is right.
 If I believe,
 others will believe, sir?
         "A" plus, Mr. Collins.
 Thank you, sir.
 And, as my good friend
 Ray would say,

              So, this is what it was all about?
            This is why we went on and on?
               Huh?
                It was why.

                I've changed.
       I was checking out of here tonight. Honest.

 So, this whole thing  had nothing to do

   It saddens me,
 it disappoints me,
 that an individual
 has wasted a lot of
 your and my valuable time.
 He has been exposed to biased
 and censored material.
 He has left me little choice
 but to declare

                    Shut up.
 The jury is dismissed.
 A new hearing will be set
 at a later date.

          Bye.
                 Hey, Columbo,
                 get back here!
              Come back here with my truck,
              you little shit!
 Don't leave me out here
 in this damn dump by myself!

                 Hello?
    <i> Monica!</i>
                  You?
 I figured it out.
 It's not about a disgruntled employee
 being fired.
 It's about non-recyclables!
            Non-recyclables?
         You're starting
         to sound like Frank.
      I don't have time for you
      or your silly ideas.
           I'm late for work.
 Oh, great!
 Great, great, great!

   Frank! Frank!
 Mr. CFC himself!
 He'll know about this stuff.
 Look up Frank.
 He's an environmentalist!

 Gotta call Frank.



 Oh, hey! How are you?
 Hey, how was jury duty?
 Thanks for volunteering
 for me. Hawaii was great.
     Look at the tan.
     Check it out.
 Anytime you want
 to make that trade,
      I'm your guy.
      I'm up for that.

         Anytime, Frank.

           Oh, Frank, thank God you're here.
           We need to talk.
            What are you doing?
        I figured it out.
 I did a little
 Holmes and Watson,
 and I know why
 the killer's been killing.
                     Why?
 Three words, Frank,
 non-recy-clables!
 He hasn't been killing
 because he's been fired!
                No, no, no, no.
   He was pissed because these places are
   still using non-recyclables.
           He's one
           of you guys, Frank.
          Hello? Bingo!
          Chi-ching, chi-ching.
            You okay, Frank?
           Fine.
           Can you believe it?
           You're gonna help me find him, right?

       You can't leave
       your shoes lying around.
           Someone's liable
           to break their neck.
 So, does anybody else know about this little,
 uh, theory of yours?
              Monica,
              but she hates me.
 Why? You're so likeable!
     You know something, Frank?
          What?
                You can help me
                with Monica.
           She won't believe me
           by myself,
   but with you there, oh, yes.
   She'd buy it in a second!
  You're so smart, Tommy!
             And that is
             why you elected me
               jury foreman.
    Let's go.




      Come on, let's go, Frank!
       Come on, Frank, come on!
    What are you doing here?
    I told you I didn't want...
      I know, Monica, I've been
      a complete jerk, okay?
          I'm sorry.
          But I figured it out.
           Whoever this guy is, he's got something
           for non-recyclables.
                 Right, Frank?
           Good thinking.
           You got a gun.
         We might need
         that later. Smart.
               Anyways, Monica,
               please listen...
           Frank, come on.
           You gotta find the guy first.
           Put the gun away.
          Whoever he is, right, he's gotta be some flipped out,
          psycho environmentalist guy, right?

        I mean,
        he's very similar to...
                     Frank?
                 Frank.
 That's a pretty
 smart idea, Frank.
 Getting on the jury
 to convince us
 Bishop was guilty.
                   Thanks.
 Ouch, that's too tight,
 I can't breathe.
 Nice cutlery, Frank.
 I wouldn't carve
 your initials in the table.
 Look, the librarian's
 right here.
                  Don't worry.
             I won't be carving
             the table.
 What can we do?
 There's gotta be something.
                There's a guard
                out front.
     Oh, I'll get
     his attention.
                           How?
      Okay, watch,
      watch, watch.


                 Uh... Uh!

              Couldn't you
              have just yelled?
    What the hell is
    going on in here?
            Hey!
          Ahh!
         And that is why we elected you
         jury foreman.
                  Got any other
                  bright ideas?
   Yeah, just one.

              Hush up, Tom!
              That was
              your bright idea?
 You'll see.
 <i> This capital is one of</i>
 <i> the USA's busiest. April?</i>
               <i> What is Denver?</i>
 <i> Right.</i>
             <i> "State capitals"</i>
             <i> for $400, please.</i>
 <i> The answer there,</i>
 <i> the daily double!</i>

         Whatever your plan is,
         it's not working.
 Wait. What time is it?

                        8:57.
 Oh, damn! <i> Jeopardy!</i>
 <i> ...look at today's</i>
 <i> final Jeopardy category,</i>
    <i> "Poland."</i>
 <i> We'll be back with a clue relating to that subject</i>
 <i> following this break.</i>

 Why did you do it, Frank?
 Or should I call you the psycho
 environmentalist killer?
               My mother
               called me Billy.
    I'll tell you why I did it.
    I'm only hastening the inevitable!
            Mother Earth needs
            to cleanse herself,
          or we're all gonna
          burn in a fiery hell!
              Oh, God, can't you see?
              There's no hope!

   Aren't you
   a ray of sunshine?
 Sure there is.
 There's plenty of hope.
 But you have to turn the world around
 to help people.
     Free Willy, Billy,
     not kill Willy.
          Billy.
                    No.
               Kill Tommy,
                 Tommy.


 I knew you'd
 come save us.

                Come on, Puppy!



 Okay, let's go.

 You wait here.
 I'll take care of him.
            What are you doing?
 Come on, Frank.
 Come on.
    You want some of me, Frank?
    Come on, come on.

           Now, I really
           can't breathe.

     I can't breathe.

          Please.
           The verdict is in.
           You are sentenced
           to die.
        Asbestos.



 So that's what
 these things are for.
       Look on the bright side,
       Frank.
          At least
          you're biodegradable.

                     Well, 6,
             I think it's time
             we deliberate.
 I couldn't agree more.
