Why did you come here?!
This isn't the time to ask that, is it?
You...
You are the City Hunter after all.
Boys!
Father, are you all right?
I'm okay, so go catch those guys.
You've been really hurt.
Let's go to the hospital first.
Chairman Park,
are you really going to act like this?
I'm someone who has blocked a merger and
acquisition attempt of Do Young Group twice.
What?
Impossible to revive?
Our Haewon will not collapse
over a measly 3 billion.
A debt ratio of 500 percent?
That's impossible.
Chairman Park, you know very well
our Haewon is sound and healthy!
<i>The mobile customer is currently on the
line. You will be connected to voicemail.</i>
I have to tell the chairman
about the City Hunter.
I'm sure it was the guy I saw
at that woman's house.
At this rate, he's going to get me first.
Before that...
What are you doing here
instead of going home?
The one with the worst fitness aptitude
in our section is Dr. Lee Yoon Sung.
Wow, that's really suspicious.
At the parking lot earlier,
seeing Dr. Lee Yoon Sung overpower
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo with one blow,
we all fell into a panic.
Agent Kim, you probably
can't believe it either, can you?
Ah, I trained Lee Yoon Sung so I know.
He's very athletic,
so he learns fast and improves fast.
And he's got such an excellent trainer.
Then, it's because I have no skill
that my student is in that shape?
Do you think maybe after he resigned
from the Blue House,
he had martial arts training?
You know that expression he had
when Kim Na Na always flipped him?
That bitter expression...
You remember, right?
That's it.
Wow, how petty.
Training on his own like that...
How can a man have such little loyalty?
Right?
There's really something not right.
I'm going to Dr. Lee Yoon Sung's house
and ask him directly.
- Just a moment, Agent Shin.
- Excuse me!
Look at this. Doenjang* girl, material girl.
(*likes expensive name brand imports)
Your hidden motive to use this
as an excuse to stick to Lee Yoon Sung
is written all over your face.
Look here.
I'm a very curious woman who can't sleep
if I'm curious about something.
- Move.
- Then, I'll go with you.
I'll ask him
where he got his martial arts training.
If you keep this up,
I just may throw you and beat you.
Uh? Oh! My bag!
T... That's expensive.
Has something happened?
He has let even the Blue House people know.
We've treated him quickly,
but he has a severe bruise
on his left shoulder,
so he's going to have to be careful
for the time-being.
His injured leg
must have been in a lot of pain.
Let's wait to see the results of the exam
to talk about that.
Thank you.
I didn't know Chun Jae Man
would ambush this quickly.
[Bear Na Na]
<i>So the City Hunter's name is Lee Yoon Sung?</i>
Kim Na Na stubbornly resisted,
I lost all my strength getting her here.
I just wanted to kill her on the way,
so I just barely managed
to hold myself back.
Lee Yoon Sung, you can't come.
You absolutely cannot come!
<i>It's dangerous if you come.
I'm fine, so do not come, okay?</i>
If you touch Kim Na Na,
I'm going to kill you.
Who knows?
I'm very fickle.
I could kill her now.
Where are you right now?
Haewon Sea World.
Before Kim Na Na dies,
you have to see her face, at least.
Please look after Father.
Kim Na Na.
Kim Na Na!
Kim Na Na.
You know what happens if I press this,
don't you?
Kim Na Na will never be able
to get out of that water.
Put them on.
Na Na, wait.
Are you all right?
Can you breathe okay?
I'm okay.
Let's get you to a hospital.
It's not that bad.
I'm fine.
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me.
You almost died today.
Then you should have let me die.
Why did you save me?
Kim Na Na.
Do you really not know me?
Just because you don't answer me,
do you think I won't wait?
I...
will wait.
I will wait for you forever.
Are you really going
to keep making things hard for me?
Let's go on together.
I don't know where the end might be,
but if we go together, it won't be lonely.
I won't leave you to be lonely any longer.
I don't think I can make it without you now.
Just a little bit...
Wait just a little bit.
I can see the end now.
<i>Love...</i>
<i>Because of that love...</i>
<i>Because of that person,</i>
<i>I have lived until now.</i>
<i>Today...</i>
<i>Once today has passed,</i>
<i>If I never see that person again...</i>
You are
a Presidential Security Service agent?
<i>What will I do?</i>
<i>Of all the countless destinies,</i>
<i>Why did the two of us have to meet?</i>
<i>We loved and then we parted ways.</i>
<i>All that we created together,</i>
<i>All the moments we shared,</i>
<i>I cannot forget.</i>
<i>I said I'd stay by your side forever.</i>
<i>A promise more precious than life itself...</i>
<i>I cannot do this for you.</i>
<i>I'm unable to fulfill this promise to you.</i>
I'm going to wait,
since you said you are coming back,
since you said
you are coming back when it ends...
<i>Because of that love, weeping...</i>
<i>Only you understand,</i>
<i>My love is absolutely not foolish.</i>
Wait just a little bit.
I'll finish this
and go back to you alive.
<i>My love.</i>
What happened to your clothes?
Ahjussi, come see me for a minute.
Whoa, he looks mean.
He's Chun Jae Man's henchman.
He knows my face
so I brought him here for now.
Just feed him, Ahjussi.
What's the use of my taking red ginger
for my health?
When you make my chest
thump nervously everyday?
Aigoo, he always makes me
do dangerous things.
And blocks my credit cards.
I'll release the cards.
Really?
[Chairman Chun Jae Man]
Chairman Chun Jae Man?
Who are you?
Who do you think?
City Hunter?
I'll keep your subordinate
well-fed and well-rested.
Don't worry.
A guy who lets himself become a hostage
is of no use to me.
Kill him or not, do whatever you want.
<i>Actually, killing him would be better,
that way he'll keep his mouth shut.</i>
Chairman Chun,
how will you keep anyone
working for you then?
Let's meet soon.
It's not anything shocking.
He even abandoned Lee Kyung Wan
after 30 years.
Did you think you'd be different?
Ahjussi, I'm going out for a bit.
Oh, yeah.
What do you like?
Do you like chicken or ribs?
Or grilled beef?
I have domestic ham from the
home shopping channel in the fridge.
Do you want that?
Oh? W... What?
Y... ou...
Wha... Fine.
Forget it then, don't eat it.
I'll just give you rice and water.
Geez!
Hey, Yoon Sung.
That guy you captured,
he's really a weird guy.
I asked him nicely what he wanted to eat,
and he gave me a dirty look!
I wanted to just...
hit him.
Ah, ah, you've been busy,
so I haven't been able to give it to you.
Your mom asked me to give you this.
Mom?
Yeah.
You should be good to your mom.
You're not good-looking for no reason.
Chun Jae Man has already made a move.
Chun Jae Man did?
Chun Jae Man tried to have Father killed.
He's severely hurt,
so he probably won't be able to move easily
during this round of punishment.
The boss is hurt?
Is he severely hurt?
He's in the hospital right now.
When you have time, go look in on him.
Is anything broken?
If something's broken,
I should bring him some beef leg bone soup.
Chun Jae Man, such a bad guy...
Hey, Yoon Sung.
No matter if you're in a war with
the boss right now, a father is a father.
You can't let a guy
who does that to your father get away!
I think Chun Jae Man tried to kill Father
because he figured out his plan.
Father moved more quickly than I thought.
Plan?
[Haewon Construction Cash Flow Statement]
It's as I expected.
Father used the Haewon Construction
contract as collateral for a 3 billion loan.
And in the process of overextending
Haewon Construction to acquire Han-Il Life,
the Swiss account
has been completely emptied.
Haewon Construction...
Chun Jae Man...
Oh? Prosecutor.
What happened?
Did you meet Lee Yoon Sung?
He got away.
Again?
Again, again, again?
But since I made Lee Yoon Sung drop
his fake image, I'm somewhat satisfied.
What do you mean?
It's just something.
Are you going somewhere?
Ah, yes. Today is the first trial in
the Haewon Chemicals' employee lawsuit
to have an industrial accident
acknowledged and redressed.
So I was going to drop in.
Oh, yeah.
The list of background checks that
the City Hunter sent regarding the waivers,
I sorted and left it on your desk.
Take a look.
Okay.
I'll see you when you come back.
Ah, come back?
Then, were you going to go straight home
from the courthouse?
Of course you should come back.
I'll come.
Yeah.
So this is a list of background checks.
They're all in the hospital.
Excuse me.
You're Choi Myung Sook, correct?
That's me, but who are you?
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office.
I have a few questions I'd like to ask you
regarding Haewon Chemicals.
Are you, perhaps, being discharged
from the hospital right now?
No. I've been ordered to vacate
the sterile room.
If you have leukemia,
don't you have to stay in a sterile room...
because your immune system is weak?
It has come to this since we filed
the industrial accident lawsuit.
I returned the 30 million I received
for signing a waiver.
Because the man they call City Hunter
helped the protesters at the site,
and even took back my contract,
I was so grateful,
I couldn't just forget about it.
I fully intend to win the judgment
for the industrial accident claim.
You said you were a prosecutor, right?
If I have a recording of a situation
where I was threatened,
would that help me in the trial?
If it is acknowledged
that you were threatened,
it will definitely be to your advantage
in a court of law.
That's a relief. I think it was a good idea
that I recorded it with my phone.
Just a moment.
This is my card.
If you have any questions regarding the law,
or need my assistance,
call me anytime.
The industrial accident lawsuit
will likely be very difficult,
but I'm sure you'll win.
Please take care of your health.
Thank you, Prosecutor.
Excuse me, Ahjussi.
Hmm?
What do I need to do
to meet City Hunter hyung?
I'm not sure.
Why?
I saw on TV before that the City Hunter
takes down all the bad people.
I wish he'd come quickly and help my mom.
If you find City Hunter hyung,
please give it to him.
And tell him to please come.
All right. If I meet City Hunter hyung,
I'll make sure to let him know.
And you, since your mother is sick,
should stay next to her and nurse her well.
Okay.
He's a fan of the man called City Hunter.
Then, take care.
Let's go.
I'm going to try to get a warrant
for Chairman Chun's arrest again.
Then, if people start talking
about coercive investigation,
are you going to take responsibility?
They said there's no concerns of flight or
destruction of evidence. Just investigate.
The man threatens laborers
and even forces them to sign
industrial accident claim waivers,
and there's no possibility
of destruction of evidence?
Even after Haewon Chemicals close
their factory doors, you still can't get it?
The toxic substances
found in the waste waters...
if we examine those again,
do you think we'll get the same result?!
Even if you don't bark at me
with your eyes bulging,
I have at least that much of a clue.
Didn't I warn you?
Did you think it would be easy to knock down
an age-old structure with your bare hands?!
A Senior Prosecutor and
a District Deputy Prosecutor were ruined.
No matter how strong your backing might be,
how long do you think you're going to last?
- So, then I should give up?
- Who said to give up, Kid?!
The composure and wisdom
to wait for the right time,
you don't have that right now.
Facing a runaway train,
you want to show your opponent your hand
in a card game?
The bland and insipid law,
always collapsing in the face of power,
I'm seriously sick of it, sick of it.
Then, take that bland and insipid law,
and you try to give it a spicy sting.
No matter what anyone says
about Kim Young Joo, that rookie,
I value him.
Don't disappoint me and my expectations.
Geez really...
Prosecutor.
What should we do?
The Haewon Chemicals laborers
lost their case
in the first round of trials.
Even with Choi Myung Sook's recording
of the threats, they lost?
They were all crying and moaning.
It felt like total house of mourning.
It was too hard to watch anymore so I left.
What kind of law lets this happen?
Even if the source of a disease's onset
is not absolutely medically evident,
these people have been exposed to
toxic substances continuously for years.
The law has no flexibility.
Do you think it's just flexibility it lacks?
Warrants get filtered
before they're approved.
Wait.
What if the City Hunter
accomplishes what we couldn't?
If he catches him, socially obliterates him,
and delivers him to us,
then we're humiliated again.
Seriously, these days,
I'm so embarrassed to face my nephews.
There's no way we're losing
to the City Hunter this time.
I'm not only going to catch Chairman Chun,
but I'm going to make certain
those Haewon Chemicals laborers...
get that admission
of an industrial accident,
according to the law.
Let's just exchange the president's clothes
and let's go quickly.
You might be late for your part-time job.
Unni, I'm thinking I might quit
my part-time job.
To study again?
The way I see it, I think it would be better
just to do the part-time job.
If you get into college on your third
or fourth try, your anti-fans will multiply.
Not to study.
I'm thinking...
Should I move to the cafe
near the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office?
Then I could see my Prosecutor
Kim Young Joo all the time, everyday.
Wouldn't that be great?
Why don't you just say
you're going to take the bar exam?
I'm just trying to pass the basic math
proficiency test, what bar exam?
Do you have this in size 100?
Please exchange it for this one.
You can't.
Where do you think you're going
in this state?
That's unreasonable, Boss.
If it wasn't for Yoon Sung,
you could have been killed by Chun Jae Man.
Chun Jae Man, that bastard,
must be punished by my hand.
I think you have no choice
but to leave it to Yoon Sung this time.
Boss, with your body in this state,
it would be hard.
You could overextend yourself
and get unnecessarily exposed.
Didn't you say you were going to carry out
the world's cruelest revenge?
Who is the 5th to be punished?
Why won't you tell even me?!
Boss!
Yeah, you're right.
For now, then,
we'll just keep driving forward
until Haewon Group is ultimately bankrupt.
Any movements on their side?
Because of the debt ratio being 500 percent,
it will be hard for any cash to flow.
Bank creditors, Assemblymen,
the heads of businesses...
Contact everyone who's connected with them.
The bank called.
We're facing 1st phase* bankruptcy. (final
chance to pay and avoid ultimate bankruptcy)
What are we going to do?
There are even business managers
from our subcontractors
waiting outside to see you right now.
Steve Lee, that bastard,
throwing away 300 billion won of his own,
was targeting bankruptcy for Haewon.
I even pulled in all of the slush fund
in the Swiss account to acquire Han-Il Life.
Still, we couldn't possibly
go bankrupt over 3 billion, could we?
Shut up!
For now, get rid of all the people
waiting out there.
And...
reserve an airline ticket to the US, to LA.
Yes.
Absolutely not...
I'm absolutely not going
to be taken down so easily.
I'm Chun Jae Man.
Chun Jae Man!
[Haewon Construction Can't Block
3 Billion Won 1st Phase Bankruptcy]
1st phase bankruptcy?
Subsidiaries
are also in danger of bankruptcy?
It's not possible that Haewon Group
could be ruined. It's not, right?
You never know.
From what I hear, their debt ratio
is 500 percent. It probably won't be easy.
Oh, no.
My brother works at a Haewon company.
He's planning to get married in the fall
and has reserved a hall and everything.
They won't really be ruined, will they?
Ah, to brother-in-law...
Ah, I mean to your brother...
I'm sorry, but frankly,
there's no job like one in the Blue House.
The president can only stay for 5 years,
but we're secure until retirement age,
and it's a safe job, how great is that?
So, when you're picking a man,
don't look far,
but look close to you, close.
Should I?
Oh?
It's Dr. Lee Yoon Sung!
Oh!
Dr. Lee.
This is rather a grand welcome to work.
So, Dr. Lee Yoon Sung,
have you been fooling us till now?
Explain the incident yesterday.
What do you mean fooling us.
He just got martial arts training, right?
But where is it?
Is it really expensive?
Well that's all fine,
but what exactly is your relationship
with Prosecutor Kim Young Joo? Huh?
When I told him you were out, his eyes
got huge and he was interrogating me.
I know Prosecutor's ex-wife,
and there was a little misunderstanding.
It's my personal life. I'm sorry
to have caused a disturbance to you.
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo is a divorcee?
If Da Hye finds out, she'll be shocked.
Just tell me
where that martial arts studio is.
If I tell them you sent me,
would I be able to get a discount?
I don't think you have a chance
with your salary.
Just learn well from Agent Shin.
Even if I look like this,
I am a judo black-belt.
That movement and handling yesterday
isn't something you can learn
in a short time.
Did you enjoy the green tea
I sent you last time?
The green tea?
Of course.
I've been drinking green tea so much lately,
that my skin...
is swollen puffy.
Totally!
And because she drinks so much, she
goes to the restroom like 30 times a day.
Whoa.
That guy. Not only did he go off
with my bag yesterday...
He pisses me off, really.
Ah, that's right, Dr. Lee.
The president wants to see you in his office
when you come in.
Go on.
The president?
The Blue House is the center of balance
of Korea.
This place that is responsible
for the welfare and development of Korea
may not be shaken
because of any other motive.
Why are you telling me this?
I wonder if there was any chance
that someone with a disguised identity
came in here.
I imagine if such an unbelievable scenario
is possible.
Mr. President, you were looking for me?
Ah, Dr. Lee, do you have some time
after work today?
After work?
Yes, I know.
One of your conditions in working here
was to be able to leave exactly on time.
But, won't you make some time today?
Well, it's not hard to make time,
but if it's computer study,
then how about now?
No, it's not the computer.
I told you once before, right?
That I'd take you somewhere good.
When my head hurts and I'm frustrated,
there's a place I go,
and I wanted to show you.
What do you think, can you go?
All right.
I'll see you after work.
Okay, then at the end of the day,
I'll send an assistant
to the Network Communications Center.
Yes.
[Haewon Group Subsidiaries
Also in Danger of Bankruptcy]
Haewon Construction,
1st phase bankruptcy...
By 6pm tonight,
if they can't deliver 3 billion won,
they're ultimately bankrupt.
If this happens, that fire will spread
to the entire Haewon Group.
How could that be?
Still, they are Haewon Group.
Could they really go bankrupt
over 3 billion won?
Their debt ratio is 500 percent.
Even if they're Haewon,
it won't be easy this time.
Don't you think, Prosecutor?
I think an insolvent enterprise
is like a home built on sand.
If it's shaken once,
even kids playing with water
can make it collapse.
Bank Manager Kim, this is Chun Jae Man.
Please give us an extension
on the bill due date.
That 3 billion,
I will make sure it gets paid.
It will be difficult
to push it back any further.
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
Yes.
Why don't you continue your conversation?
No, that's all right.
There are too many non-performing loans
that any more extensions are impossible.
It's like pouring water in a jar
that has lost its bottom.
<i>Your call cannot be connected...</i>
Why aren't you answering?
Haewon Group.
They opened up subsidiaries
like octopus tentacles.
Now, over half of them
are facing capital erosion.
I don't think that anyone will want
to come in and acquire them.
How can you come here, putting
the assemblyman in a difficult position?
What?
How long has it been since
he accepted my money and won his election?
A difficult position?
Assemblyman Lee is inside, isn't he?
I'm going to meet with him.
Please get out.
Shall I call the police?
And what do you think, Assemblyman?
Public funding and support
for insolvent enterprises...
The citizens won't accept that any longer.
They've endured this long
aligned with political allies,
but this time, it would be difficult.
Please eat.
<i>Your call cannot be connected.
At the tone...</i>
Haewon Construction?
It's bad enough they're involved
with bribery and illegal bid tendering,
but they're an unethical company
that used violence to suppress
their laborers demands
for an admission of an industrial accident.
Ah, your cup is empty.
Let me pour you a cup.
The bank president is in, right?!
He's not in right now.
Where is he?
I must meet him!
It's a huge lump of faulty operations.
Letting it become bankrupt
is the best route.
The creditors are all in agreement.
How can you all do this?
Lee Jin Pyo.
Sitting in the president's seat,
I've been able to see the problems
very clearly.
Haewon Group is a sinking boat.
Jostling it recklessly
will only result in a bigger loss.
The 300 billion I invested,
I've already given up on it.
Please save me.
The 2030 classified document that you want,
I will hand it over to you.
Classified document?
- Hmm?
- What is that?
Classified document?
What are you talking about?
Chairman Chun...
I see the bankruptcy
has put you in quite a state of shock.
We are currently
having an important discussion,
so could you please leave?
Let go, You Punks.
Let go. Let go!
Let go!
I, Chun Jae Man
will not go down like this.
When I was young,
my father taught me how to fish.
From baiting to skinning...
I want to bring my son,
but he has gone into the army
and I don't have anyone.
Since you've come with me at least,
I'm grateful.
Don't mention it.
It's Chairman Chun Jae Man.
What shall I do?
Yes, this is Choi Eung Chan.
Mr. President.
I'm calling because it's urgent.
The construction firm
is facing 1st phase bankruptcy.
<i>Please help me avoid final bankruptcy</i>
by gathering up 3.5 billion won for me.
If we can't block this,
Haewon subsidiaries
will fall bankrupt one by one.
You have good personal connections
so I'm sure you'll be able to get it soon.
Everybody is avoiding me right now!
Do you know how many companies
go bankrupt everyday in Korea?
If one person suffers bankruptcy...
and another blocks bankruptcy
because he knows the president well,
the principles of fairness and equity
would be violated.
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
If I'm ruined, do you know
how many jobs will be lost?!
Those jobs you promised to create
will completely disappear!
The pus must be extracted
for the abscess to heal.
I told you many times to value your laborers
and admit to an industrial accident.
Faulty management can't just be left alone
and allowed to continue.
I'm rather busy
and need to get off the phone now.
Don't accept his calls anymore.
Yes, Mr. President.
The weather is rather hot. Shall I buy
something cold to drink for everyone?
Sure. If you're buying,
I'll have something to drink.
Agent Kim Na Na.
Go with him so we all can have some.
Yes, Sir.
Chae Man, fellow...
Why can't you end your greed?
You go on back.
I'll go myself.
<i>Just a little bit...</i>
Wait just a little bit.
I can see the end now.
What is that?
I bought some refreshments.
What's the matter?
Nothing, it's nothing.
- Here drink this.
- Ah, thank you.
Chief, aren't you a little too tense today?
I didn't hear his footsteps.
Please drink some of these.
[Finance:
Haewon Group Final Bankruptcy Procedures]
Huh?
Haewon Construction
final bankruptcy procedures?
Oh, Yoon Sung.
Look at this.
They say they're proceeding with
final bankruptcy for Haewon Group.
Has the 6 hours passed?
It's gone as Father planned.
Aigoo, Chairman Chun Jae Man...
Now, what happens?
Is the boss going to handle it all?
Since Father put this much effort into it,
it's time for me to step in.
Haewon Group subsidiaries are likely
to fall bankrupt one after the other.
Then, each company will be ruined,
and even if a company
steps up to acquire them,
a mass layoff is probably inevitable.
And an acquisition won't be easy either
because of the debt.
Then, what about the people who work there?
Do they all end up on the streets?
That won't do.
Of course, that won't do.
Yes, I understand.
Prosecutor.
The Haewon Group creditors
have decided an extension isn't possible
and have moved into
final bankruptcy proceedings.
The group has provided a high rate
of financial guarantees,
so it's obvious the subsidiaries
will face bankruptcy next.
Even when the IMF case erupted,
the most pitiable were those workers
who became unemployed overnight.
What's going to happen?
Subsidiaries, partners, subcontractors...
all those families amount to over
hundreds of thousands of people.
They say after the construction firm,
Haewon Chemicals is next.
They fought so hard to claim
an industrial accident.
If the company is ruined, what good
is an admission of an industrial accident?
So, the management consider themselves
creditors too...
and only think of their money
and not the workers, is that it?
Chun Jae Man...
If the subsidiaries begin to fall,
he'll try to flee the country.
- Investigator Jang Pil Jae.
- Yes?
Put an international travel ban
on Chairman Chun.
Yes, Sir.
- Investigator Kim Mi Ok.
- Yes.
The quickest way to get an arrest
is tax evasion, right?
Let's go with that.
I understand.
Is this going as Lee Jin Pyo planned?
I don't think he'd think twice
about the workers.
Prosecutor, where are you going?
But, we're busy...
Lee Jin Pyo's approach to ruin Chun Jae Man
was really excellent.
But, there's something that worries me.
The workers...
And their families...
I don't want them
to go through pain and sadness.
That sounds like Kim Na Na's Daddy Long Legs
Ahjussi. (*secret benefactor)
For some reason,
I thought the City Hunter
might think that way too.
I'm not the City Hunter, how would I know?
I'm busy.
My girlfriend is waiting.
If you find the City Hunter,
will you give him this?
100 won?
Some little child
says he's a City Hunter fan.
He wants him to punish the people
who made his mother sick
and to help his mother.
Then you should find him and give it to him.
Why give this to me?
Because I plan to help through the law,
those people.
Give it your best shot to help them.
My girlfriend is waiting.
He's a fund manager from New York.
He says he has an interest
in Haewon Chemicals
and wants to see you now.
Right now?
Yes.
Send him in.
I'm Ha Tae Sung.
I'm Chun Jae Man.
City Capital...
isn't that a notorious hedge fund?
If you're talking notorious,
Haewon Group is no stranger to notoriety.
Since we seem to know about each other well,
shall I get straight
to the heart of the matter?
We have intentions to acquire
Haewon Chemicals.
Haewon Chemicals is our group's cash cow.
Cash cow...
An enterprise that creates a lot of profit,
but also one with
a limited growth potential.
And the dangerous work environment
has caused problems
with workers claiming industrial accidents.
But you coming here knowing that,
isn't it because of money?
Of course.
But the debts are so immense, I'm
conflicted and still only considering it.
I'm sure other companies
considering acquisition
face the same conflicted thoughts.
A wrong move and we could become
like Haewon with Han-Il Life,
a jar without a base at the bottom.
I heard the Public Prosecutor's Office
is investigating you.
It seems we'll be seeing you in a prisoner's
uniform shortly, the way things are going.
What?
For the head of A&N Group
that went completely bankrupt last year,
the prosecution asked for the maximum
sentence of 22 years and 6 months
and received 10 years of hard labor,
you know that right?
Misappropriation, illegal loans, altogether
it appears to be around 1.3 trillion won.
If my calculations are correct,
sentences for involved Haewon Group
management will be right along those lines.
What is it you want to say?
If you want to spend a little less
of your life in the slammer,
you'll want to reduce your debt, right?
We'll take over Haewon Chemicals' debt,
so sell it to us.
At what price?
Are you playing with me?!
The debts are immense.
If something goes wrong, we could be ruined.
Yet, I said we'd take it over.
Shouldn't you be grateful?
Or forget it if you want to.
Let's do it!
A contract...
Chairman Chun Jae Man
is transferring 51 percent of Haewon
Chemicals' stocks to its employees.
In return, until debts are paid off
and operations return to normal,
the employees will agree
to a 20 percent reduction in wages.
An industrial accident will be acknowledged,
and all hospital fees, treatment fees,
and compensation will be paid.
And, an improvement
of the work environment is promised.
If he divides his stock among us,
then we're now stockholders too!
They say the company debt
is shared among us too.
We are workers and we're owners.
That's what they're saying.
Let's all get better and return to work.
Let's all work hard
and develop a good company.
Wow, a day like this even comes in my life.
You really worked hard.
They say this was the City Hunter.
They say this came from the City Hunter.
- City Hunter?
- Yeah.
City Hunter?
<i>Accumulating debt,
in a state of capital erosion,</i>
<i>and facing financial hardship,
Haewon Chemicals</i>
<i>was successfully sold,
and at the point of ultimate crisis,</i>
<i>has dramatically found
a possibility for revival.</i>
You're not in good condition.
Why don't you go to the hospital?
It's all right.
<i>...acquisition for 100 won
is becoming a hot topic of conversation.</i>
I suppose that's Yoon Sung's work?
I didn't expect he'd buy it for 100 won.
A court judgment
is not sufficient for those guys.
They have to die.
Immediately tomorrow?
[Chun Jae Man]
He must have really been in a hurry.
Wow, buying a company with 100 won?
On the condition they take over the debt?
It says, "Standing at the edge of a cliff,
the company found
a miraculous possibility of revival
through employee stockholders. "
It was bought with 100 won?
Could it be Lee Yoon Sung?
Prosecutor.
There's something wrong with the
international travel ban on Chun Jae Man.
It hasn't gone into effect yet.
What?!
This is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
from the Seoul District Office.
The international travel ban
for Chairman Chun Jae Man of Haewon group,
why hasn't t been put into effect yet?!
What if he gets on a plane and takes off...
as you take into account
the order in which requests were made?!
These are major economic crimes.
Put the ban into effect immediately.
Even though they say Chun Jae Man
has lost all his limbs and lifelines,
could there still be someone
looking out for him?
Oh, my God!
What do we do?
It looks like Chun Jae Man
will be on a 2:30 plane to LA today.
What should we do?
We absolutely can't allow him to escape.
I'm going to catch him no matter what.
Call the airport immediately and tell them
not to let the plane take off.
Kim Young Joo.
Go to the front of
the Public Prosecutor's Office by 4:00.
The City Hunter will come.
Ah, Honey.
I'm at the airport.
You worried a lot, didn't you?
I'm not going to be finished off like this.
Of course, I'm going to return for payback.
I'll see you in LA in about 12 hours.
All right, bye.
Haewon Chemicals is worth 100 won?
Just because it has some debt?
Punks...
I'm absolutely returning for payback.
Absolutely...
<i>Oh, its all right.</i>
<i>Even if I disobey the heavens,
I'll protect you.</i>
<i>Oh, its all right.</i>
<i>The beatings of my heart for you
never stop.</i>
<i>Oh, its all right.</i>
<i>Please overlook my scars.
You're my ever love.</i>
<i>Oh, its all right.</i>
<i>This suffocating despicable crazy world
filled with sadness.</i>
<i>Neon sign, on and off</i>
<i>All that lingers in my heart
is my memory of you.</i>
<i>All my love for you...</i>
That must be him.
<i>All my life for you...</i>
<i>I will never cry...</i>
<i>Oh, its all right.</i>
Who are you?
I've done nothing wrong.
City Hunter left a message.
He said he was coming to
the Public Prosecutor's Office at 4:00,
and that if I wanted to meet him,
to come with a mask on.
Someone else is coming from over there.
Yes, Ahjussi.
You did what I asked earlier, right?
Of course I did.
But, wow, you're quite popular.
The response was immense.
[2 hours earlier]
At...
[2 hours earlier]
4:00 pm...
I will be at the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Those who want to meet me,
come and gather, wearing a mask.
City Hunter.
Enter.
Done.
Take them all in!
Take them all in!
- What is this?
- What's going on?
What's going on?
What is this?
What is this?
What's going on?
What are you doing?!
What's this?
What are you doing?!
Hey! Hey!
There's someone over there!
Oh?
It's Chairman Chun Jae Man, isn't it?
[I trust in Korea]
Those are army tags.
Prosecutor!
Where did the prosecutor go?
I don't really know.
- Find him.
- Yes.

<i>I want you so badly,
enough to make me crazy.</i>
<i>Ive prayed all along for us to meet again.</i>
<i>Im a shell of a person,
more dead than alive.</i>
<i>Could you please come to my side now?</i>
<i>I beg you.</i>
<i>I told myself I'd be fine alone,</i>
<i>that I'd do just as well without you.</i>
