Please, baron!
Missed!
As far as I can tell from
the recent trend of events,
you will probably be back
in Berlin within a week.
When you get there, my dear Von Bork,
I think you will be surprised
at the welcome
you will receive.
I happen to know what is thought
at the highest quarters
of your work in this country.
English are not very hard to
deceive.
It was a great idea,
my dear Von Bork,
to pose as a sportsman--
No, no, it's not a ruse at all.
I am a born sportsman.
Well, that makes it
even more effective.
I have even heard that you
practice boxing
with the young Eglish officers.
Wonderful.
As a result,nobody takes you
very seriously.
You are a 'good old sport,'
'quite a decent fellow
for a German.'
And this whole time this
quiet country house of yours
is the source of half the mischief
in England,
and the sporting squire
happens to be the best
secret agent in Europe.
You're a genius, my dear Von Bork,
a genius!
You flatter me, Baron.
Although I can certainly claim
that six years I spent in this
country have not been unproductive.
I've never shown you
my little stash.
Would you mind
stepping in for a moment?
Some of my papers have already been
transferred.
My wife took the less important
documents with her.
She and the household
left yesterday for Flissingham.
I count on the embassy
to guard the rest.
Your name has already been
added as a staff member.
Of course,you never know.
We may have to stay.
If England leaves
France to her fate.
We know for a fact
that there is no binding
treaty between them.
And Belgium?
Yes, and Belgium, too.
- But the country's pride?
- My dear Von Bork,
we live in a utilitarian age.
Everything can be bought and sold.
Honor is a medieval conception.
Besides, England is not ready.
I should think
they would be wiser
to fight with allies
rather than alone.
This week will decide the fate
of this country.
Look!
"The Channel",
"Forts", "Ireland".
"Submarines",
"Airplanes".
Wonderful!
And all in four years, Baron.
Not a bad show for the hard drinking
country squire with a penchant for hunting.
But the gem of my collection is
still on its way
and there is
the setting, all ready for it.
Naval Signals.
You have a very impressive dossier
here.
Outdated. Waste of paper.
The Admiralty somehow got wind
of the leak of information
and every code has been changed.
But!
Thanks to my cheque book
and the good old Altamont
all will be well tonight.
Please.
"All's well. I'm bringing the new
sparking plugs soon. Altamont."
Sparking plugs, huh?
You see,
he poses as a car mechanic
and I have a full garage here.
We created a code.
Everything likely to come up in a
report is named after some spare part.
If he talks
of a radiator, it is a "battleship",
an "oil pump" means
a cruiser, and so on.
"Sparking plugs" are naval signals.
They are useful, these traitors,
but I dread paying them
their 'thirty golden coins'.
He is not a traitor at all.
I assure you
that our most patriotic Germans
have nothing on this
Irish American
when it comes to how they feel
towards England.
So he's an Irish American?
Yes.
He is a touchy fellow
and needs humouring on occasion.
He can be quite difficult,
I assure you.
Alas, I have to go.
I need
to get back to London early.
How still
and peaceful it all seems.
This all may change
in a matter of one week.
If our contact comes up with
necessary information
The sky will look different,too.
Who is that?
That is Martha,our servant.
My wife
wanted to take her to Germany,
but I decided
to keep her here.
You did?
To me,she almost personifies Britain.
With her complete self-absorption and
general air of comfortable somnolence.
My dear Von Bork!
Having won the battle against
the greed and corruption
of the new representatives
of European high society,
Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson
saved the Great Britain from what
seemed to be an inevitable war -
the letter of the capricious monarch
found its way back into the box,
Holmes returned to his farm
in Sussex.
Watson returned to
to his patients.
The times of the Good Old England
faded from everybody's memory.
And so did...
THE ADVENTURES
OF SHERLOCK HOLMES AND DR. WATSON
By Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
Sherlock Holmes
VASILIY LIVANOV
Dr. Watson
VITALIY SOLOMIN
The Twentieth Century Begins
Part Two
Come in, Watson.
You have grown a beard again.
Stay away from the window draft.
Summer colds
are always a little trying.
How did you know?
Don't tell me it's my shoes
that gave me away again.
Of course, your shoes!
The letter
from your brother Mycroft.
Your boots are new. You could not
have had them more than a few weeks.
The wingtips from what I can
gather,
are slightly burned.
For a moment I thought
they might have got wet
and you burnt them while trying
to get them dry next to a fireplace.
But near the instep there is
a small circular wafer of paper
with the shop's
hieroglyphics upon it.
Moisture would, of course,
have removed it.
That could only mean hat you've been sitting
with your feet outstretched to the fire,
It hasn't been raining in a while
So you had a cold and were trying to keep
yourself warm next to the fireplace.
- Who is Arthur Cadogan West?
- I shall tell you on the way.
My neighbor Bork came
again for the honey.
How much do you need this time?
Only one pound.
Did you manage to get
sparking plugs?
There's been a bit of a snag.
A friend of mine promised me
to take me to London today,
and I am sure
we will get everything resolved.
One shilling.
- So cheap?
- It is a blue honey.
Plus there is a discount
for regular customers.
So who is Arthur Cadogan West?
He was a clerk at Woolwich Arsenal.
His dead body was discovered on the
rails,but what train he was on
and where he was going,
we could not find out yet.
His ticket,
of course, would show that.
There was no ticket in his pockets.
No ticket!
Maybe they didn't find it?
The press printed a list
of his possessions.
His purse contained two pounds
in cash plus a cheque book,
through which his identity
was established.
There were also
two theater tickets.
and a small packet
of some technical documentation.
Well, let's start investigating!
It is a real crisis.
I have never seen
HIM so upset.
As for the Admiralty - it is buzzing
like an overturned beehive.
What were the technical papers?
The plans
of the Bruce-Partington submarine.
Surely you have heard of it?
- Bruce-Partington?
- Never.
Right!
It has been the most jealously
guarded of all government secrets.
Naval warfare becomes impossible
within the radius
of a Bruce-Partington's operation.
Two years ago a very large sum
was paid
in acquiring
the rights to the invention.
The plans,
which are exceedingly complex,
comprise some
thirty separate patents,
each essential to the working
of the whole system,
and are kept in an elaborate safe
in a confidential office
adjoining the arsenal.
If the chief constructor of the Navy
desired to consult them,
even he'd be forced to go in person
to the Woolwich office.
And suddenly we find these papers in
the pocket of a some dead junior clerk
at the heart of London.
From the official point of view
it's simply unacceptable.
But you have recovered them?
Ten papers were stolen
from the safe in Woolwich.
There were only seven
in Cadogan West's pocket.
The most essential three are gone.
Stolen, vanished.
Sherlock!
Forget everything else!
Never mind your usual
petty puzzles.
It's an international problem
of massive proportions
that you have to solve.
Why did
Cadogan West take the papers?
How did he die?
How did his body end up
where it was found?
Where are the missing documents?
He took the papers
to London to sell the secret,
intending, no doubt, to have
the plans back next morning
before they were found missing.
While in London, on this
mission of treason, he met his end.
He was going back to Woolwich when he was
killed and thrown out of the train car.
Lestrade can tell you more.
He represents Scotland Yard
in this investigation.
The most disturbing piece
of business, Sherlock.
This is
where the young man's body laid.
As you can see, the body could
not have fallen from above,
Therefore, it could only
have come from a train,
and the last train has passed
about midnight on Monday.
Have the train cars been examined
for any sign of violence?
- No such signs were found.
- None.
And no ticket has been found
on him.
No record of a train car door
being found open?
None.
Well, Holmes,it's time to pick
up a scent,like you did in the past.
There aren't many rail switchpoints
like that on this line,is there?
No, there are very few.
The case certainly
gets more and more interesting.
Fascinating.
By the way, I saw no signs
of blood.
There weren't any.
- Was he seriously wounded?
- The skull was crushed,
but nothing much on the
rest of the body.
And yet one would have
expected some bleeding.
I can assure you, Mr. Holmes,
that every car
has been carefully examined.
I saw to it myself.
It is not the cars that I think
you should have checked.
Let us continue, shall we?
The actual
official guardian of the papers
is the famous government
expert, Sir James Walter,
whose decorations and titles
can fill two full lines
in a book of reference.
He has spent his whole life
servicng his country,
a true gentleman,
a wecome guest in the most prestigious
society gatherings.
He is one of the two people
who had a key to the safe.
Sir James left for London
on Monday about three o'clock
taking his key with him.
- Has the fact been verified?
- Yes.
His brother,
Colonel Valentine Walter,
has testified to his
departure from Woolwich.
Can we see sir James Walter?
Sir James...
Sir James has passed away.
- Good heavens! When?
- This morning.
How did he die?
Perhaps
you would care to step in, sir,
and see his brother,
Colonel Valentine Walter?
Yes, we had better do so.
I don't think it's a coincidence
that the body was found
near the place
where the train shakes and sways
as it comes through the switchpoint.
The absence of blood
is not a coincidence, either.
The switchpoints would affect
no object inside the train.
We know that the doors were locked.
That is why I think that
he was killed somewhere else.
But how did the body end up
near the rails?
His body fell off the roof
of a train car.
- Off the roof?
- Yes.
It was this horrible scandal
that has caused this.
My brother, Sir James,
was a man of honor,
and he could not survive
such shame.
It broke his heart.
He was always so proud
of the efficiency of his department,
and this was a crushing blow.
We had hoped that he might have
given us some indications
which could help us
resolve the matter.
I assure you
that it was all a mystery to him
as it is to you and to all of us.
He had already told the police
everything he knew.
Naturally, he had no doubt
that Cadogan West was guilty.
But the rest is a mystery.
What is your personal opinion?
I know nothing myself save
what I have read or heard.
I have no desire
to be discourteous,
but you have to understand,
Mr. Holmes,
We are grieving at present,
and I must ask you to finish
this interview.
Young West took the papers.
Now, this could only be done
by having a copied key.
Several copied keys.
He had to open the building
and then the actual room and
then,a safe.
Tell us about Cadogan West.
We have nothing on him.
He worked as a junior clerk under
supervision of one Sidney Johnson.
No one else had an access to
the safe.
Who was
the other man with a key?
The senior clerk,Mr. Sidney Johnson.
He is forty, married, with five
children.
He has an impeccable
record in public service.
Who locked
the plans up that night?
Sidney Johnson.
A very unpleasant story,
Mr. Holmes.
The place is so disorganized.
Now the department chief is dead,
Cadogan West is dead,
Our documents have been stolen.
To think that when we locked
the office on Monday evening,
we were still as efficient an office
as any in the government service.
At what hour
was the office closed?
At five.
- Where were the plans?
- In a safe. I put them there myself.
Let's assume that Cadogan West decided
to make his way into the building
after hours.
He would need three keys,
before he could
reach the papers,right?
The key to the entrance door, the key
to the office, and the key to the safe.
Only Sir James Walter and you
had those keys?
I had no keys to the doors,
only to the safe.
Was Sir James a man
who was particular in his habits?
Yes, he was.
He carried those
three keys on the same key chain.
I have often seen them.
So he took that set of keys
with him to London?
He carried them with him
everywhere he went.
- Please.
- Thank you.
One other thing,
if a clerk in this office
desired to sell the information,
would it not be simpler
to just copy the documents
without stealing the originals?
It would take a
considerable technical knowledge
to copy the plans
in an effective way.
But I suppose both Sir James and West
had that technical knowledge.So did you.
No doubt we all did,
but I implore you to keep me
away from all this!
What is the use
of speculating in this manner
when the original plans were actually
found on Cadogan West's body?
It's just odd that he should
take the risk
of stealing the originals
if he could safely
have made copies,
and sell them without anybody
knowing.
Very odd, no doubt.
Mr. Johnson,
could you show us
how you close the shutters.
You see, Watson,
they cannot move any further.
So anyone could look inside the
office
from the street.
I cannot explain it, Mr. Holmes.
I could get no sleep
since the tragedy,
thinking, night and day, what
the true meaning of it is.
Arthur was an honest
man, and a true patriot.
He would rather have cut
his hand off
than sell a state secret
confided to his keeping.
But the facts, Miss Westbury?
Yes,I admit
I cannot explain them.
Has he had any financial prolems?
No.
His needs were very modest
and he had an ample salary.
Arthur had saved a few hundred pounds,
and we were to be engaged
at the New Year's Eve.
Were there any signs
stress?
Come, Miss Westbury,
be absolutely frank with us.
He spoke one evening
of the importance of the secret
papers kept in a safe
and I recall now
how he said that no doubt
foreign spies would pay a great deal
of money to get their hands on them.
Anything else?
He said that the government is too
careless in such matters
and it would be easy for a traitor
to get the plans, should he try.
Now tell us of that last evening
you spent together.
We were to go to the theatre.
The fog was so thick
that ordering a cab was pointless.
So we walked,
As we were walking past his office
Arthur suddenly
darted away into the fog.
- Without a word?
- Actually...
I think he yelled something.
I waited, but he never returned.
Then I walked home.
Next morning, after the office opened,
they came to inquire his whereabouts.
About twelve o'clock
we heard the terrible news.
"To Microft Holmes.
White Hall.
Please send by messenger, to await
return at Baker Street, a complete list
of all foreign spies known to be
in England, with full address. Sherlock."
"To Sherlock Holmes.
Baker Street, 221-B. Top secret.
There are plenty of
agents,
but few who could handle
so big an affair.
The only men
worth considering are
Adolph Meyer, of 13 Great
George Street, Westminster.
Louis La Rothiere, of Campden
Mansions, Notting Hill.
Hugo Oberstein, 13 Caulfield
Gardens, Kensington.
The Cabinet awaits your final report
with the utmost anxiety.
Directives from the highest quarters
have been issued.
The whole apparatus of the State
is at your disposal
should you need it.
Mycroft."
John!
John!
John, the telegram for you.
"I'm havig a lunch
at Goldini's Restaurant,
at Gloucester Road, Kensington.
Please come at once.
Bring with you a jemmy,
a lantern,
a chisel, and a revolver.
Holmes."
Have you brought the tools?
Now it must be evident to you,
that this young man's body  was
placed on the roof of the train.
Could it not have been
dropped from a bridge?
I don't think so.
- The body would not hold out there.
- It seems most improbable.
We must fall back
on the old axiom:
When all other
contingencies fail,
whatever remains,
however improbable,
must be the truth.
I found
that the leading
international agent...
Hugo Oberstein happens to
reside in a house
which is located right next to
the railway.
13 Caulfield Gardens.
So you've figured this one out,
then?
Oberstein has left for
the continent.
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
two gentlemen paying a visit
to Caulfield Gardens in his absence.
Breaking and entering again?
I don't like it, Holmes.
My dear friend, you'll just
keep watch.
I'll do the criminal part.
Think of Mycroft's note,
of the Admiralty,
which awaits the news.
Even the Prime Minister,
not to mention of one very important
person,who shan't be named
They depend on us.
You are right, Holmes.
It's our duty.
Goddamn it!
Here we are,this must be the
window we talked about.
Look, Watson! The soot on the
sill is worn out.
You can see where they rested
the body of Cadogan West.
What is this?
It is a blood stain.
There are also a few on the
staircase.
Here is the train roof,
right underneath.
Seems I was right in my
assumptions.
What do you think of it?
You have never risen
to greater heights,Holmes.
Let us continue.
The cunning dog
has covered his tracks.
His dangerous correspondence
has been destroyed or removed.
Cutouts from newspaper.
Judging by the print, it's
an ad from the Daily Telegraph.
Not a single chance for us.
No dates, but messages arrange
themselves. This must be the first.
"Hoped to hear sooner.
Terms agreed to.
Write  to the address
given on card. Pierrot."
Second message:
"Too complex for description.
Must have full report. Staff awaits
you when goods delivered.
Pierrot."
Next:
"Matter presses.
Must withdraw offer
unless contract completed.
Make appointment by letter.
Will confirm by advertisement.
Pierrot".
Finally:
"Monday night after nine.
Two knocks.
Only ourselves. Do not be
suspicious. Pierrot."
A fairly complete record.
If we could only get the man at
the other end of the correspondence!
Have you seen the
"Daily Telegraph" today?
- No.
- A new Pierrot's advertisement.
You don't say so. Smith!
Yes, sir.
Put me through to my
brother, Mycroft Holmes.
The central?
835, please.
Thank you.
Mycroft, good morning!
Yes, it is me.
- Yes.
- Here it is.
"Tonight. Same time.
Same place. Two knocks.
Most important business.
Your own safety at stake.
Pierrot."
How do you like that?
The mine we have planted seems
to be working.
And the first casualty
was our friend, Doctor Watson.
He was blown up instantly.
Yes?
No, if you come to Caulfield Gardens
at eight tonight,
I think we can
solve our problem.
Yes.
No, no, Lestrade is essential here.
He is like a terrier you need
to pull a fox out of a hole.
Sit down, Mycroft.
Sit down, gentlemen!
This is against the law,
Mr. Holmes.
The fact that we are here,in
somebody's house without permission
is breaking and entering,
no more,no less.
Quiet, inspector. You don't
know what you're talking about.
How dare you!
Whole city is under my
police supervision!
He is coming.
Don't move.
Well,that's a surprise.
- Who is he?
- It is Colonel Valentine Walter,
the younger brother
of the late Sir James Walter.
Lestrade!
What is this?
I came here to visit Mr. Oberstein.
The conspracy is uncovered,
Colonel Walter.
We discovered the correspondence
between you
and Oberstein, along with the
circumstances
concerning the death
of young Cadogan West.
We know that you
made copies of the keys
which your brother held,
and that you engaged in
a correspondence with Oberstein,
who replied to your letters through
the advertisement columns
of the Daily Telegraph.
We are aware that
you broke into the office
on the foggy Monday evening,
but you were spotted through the office
window and were followed by West,
who had probably some
previous reason to suspect you.
Leaving all his private concerns,
he followed you closely
in the fog and kept at your heels
until you reached this house.
- Here he confronted you...
- And thats when you, Colonel Walter...
added even more terrible crime
on top of the treason you have
already commited -
- Murder!
- I did not!
I swear to you, I did not
kill him!
Tell us then,
how Cadogan West met his end.
I lost money at the stock market.
My debts were growing.
Oberstein offered me
five thousand pounds.
It was to save myself from ruin.
But as for murder, I am innocent.
What happened, then?
West had his suspicions before,
and he followed me.
The young man broke into
the house
and demanded to know
what we were going
to do with the papers.
Oberstein had a brass knuckles.
The blow proved to be fatal.
Oberstein had this idea of
dropping the body on a train roof.
But first he examined the papers.
He said three of them were essential,
and that he must keep them.
The others
we stuffed into the pocket of
Cadogan West.
so that when he is found
he'll become the obious suspect.
And your brother?
He said nothing,
but he had caught me
once with his keys,
and I think that he suspected.
I read in his eyes
that he did.
It was terrible.
Where is Oberstein now?
I don't know.
Did he leave you no address?
He said he had some business
to take care of, down in Sussex.
- Where? In Sussex?
- Yes.
Let's go, Watson.
It is on our way.
No use for this one!
Wait for me, my friend,
it will take a few minutes.
I need to drop the "Handbook of
Bee Culture" at my neighbor's.
He decided to follow my example
and become a bee keeper.
See,how quiet we have it here.
Fresh air, everything's so peaceful.
Enjoy it, Watson, while you still
can.
Mr Bork!
- Well?
- Here's my delivery at last.
- Here are the sparking plugs.
- The signals?
Same as I said in my cable.
Lamp code, Marconi,
a copy, mind you,
not the original.
That was very risky. But it's the real
thing, I can testify to that.
We should celebrate
the successful
conclusion of our business.
Just a minute.
Getting ready to leave?
Listen, Bork.
Don't tell me you keep all the
papers in there?
Why not?
You're supposed to be a superspy.
Why, a petty crook could break
into that with a can opener.
If I knew that our correspondence was
going to be kept in a thing like that
I would have reconcidered my decision
to go into business with you.
No crook could nandle my safe.
You can't cut that type of metal
with any tool.
- But the lock?
- It's a double combination lock.
You need to know a word,which
in this case,a name of the
month,
as well as a two sets of figures
and digits
before you can get
the lock to work.
This upper one is for the digits,
the lower one for the letters.
We're on the verge of a war.
It was bound o happen.
So here it is.
I'm shutting down all my activities
effective tomorrow morning.
Can you get me out of here,too,
Mr Bork?
I can't stay on this
dreaded island anymore.
A week from now England
will be in the middle of the war.
I'd rather watch it
from across the Channel.
But you're an American citizen,
you've got nothing to worry about.
So was Jack James,
and he's doing time in prison
now, all the same.
It means nothing
to a British copper
whether you're US citizen or
not.
'lt's British law and order
over here,' they'd say.
It seems to me you don't do much
to take care of your men.
- What do you mean?
- Have you helped any of them?
There's James --
It was his own fault.
You know that yourself.
He lacked discipline for that type
of work.
True.
James was a bonehead.
What about Lucas?
He had a mad wife.
He was a little mad, too.
Anyone can get mad
if he sees police everywhere.
As for Oberstein--
What about him?
Don't you know?
Oberstein was arrested
with his papers.
Now he is doing time in
Portland prison.
How did they get Oberstein?
The landlady that lives next door
had a couple of visitors recently,
Made inquiries about me.
Since we came to our agreement
Oberstein was number four.
I know I'll be the fifth.
if I don't run.
I'm just curious, who has been
selling us all out?
How dare you speak to me in
such a manner!
If I couldn't dare,sir
I wouldn't be in your service
to begin with.
Rumor has it
when an agent has done his
dirty work for you
you are not particularly sorry
to see him gone.
Are you trying to suggest that
I get rid of my own agents?
Not at all.
Just take me with you
and the sooner, the better.
We have worked together
way too long
to quarrel now,at the very hour
of our victory.
You've done splendid work
and taken great risks,
I can't forget that.I'll set it up.
First, you're off to Holland,
where you can catch a boat
from Rotterdam to New York.
No other line
will be safe a week from now.
I'll take your materials
and pack it with the rest.
What about the reward?
500 pounds.
The reward.
I want it right here, right now.
All right. Have it your way.
After all, since we are all
business nowadays, Mr. Altamont,
I don't see why I should trust you
any more than you trust me.
I give you the cheque,
you give me the parcel.
I heard everything, my friend.
What's the meaning of this?
Sherlock Holmes!
What?! Sherlock Holmes?
Yes! Sherlock Holmes!
Watson,you've got a scratch.
You were incredible,
Watson, just incredible!
What happened here,Holmes?
I'll be back soon.
Martha will explain everything.
Martha!
Doctor Watson!
- How do you know me?
- Watson, you've got a wound.
What does it all mean anyway?
It means that Mr. Holmes
did a great service
for the Great Britain.
And I'm proud to consider myself
among this great man's acquaintances.
- Mrs. Hudson!
- It is me, Doctor Watson.
You recognized me, finally.
Everything that is going on here
is a state secret.
I cannot betray it even to you.
Help me, Watson.
- Is he dead?
- No, he is just sleeping.
I gave him a strong soporific.
If you, my friend,
had delayed your impressive entrance
for just five minutes,
he wouldn't have had to jump
out the window.
He fell asleep running,
a hundred metres away from the house.
Mister Holmes,
what happened to Mr Bork?
Don't worry, Mrs. Hudson,
he is just sleeping.
Allright,then.
He is a good man, in a way.
He wanted me to go
with his wife to Germany,
but that would hardly have
suited your plans, would it, sir?
As long as you were here,
my mind was at ease.
What took you so long to
give me a signal tonight?
He was on the phone
for quite some time.
I was beginning to worry until
I saw your lamp in the window.
Are you ready to leave?
Yes, sir. He has mailed
seven letters today.
I have the addresses, as usual.
Very good.
I will look into it later.
I am so glad
to see you, Doctor Watson.
How is your lovely wife?
How is your practice?
Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,
everything is just fine.
You see, mobilized again
to the military service.
So am I.
May I go, sir?
Yes, wire to Smith,
at Baker Street,
Tell him to meet us there.
Good night, Mrs. Hudson.
Yes, sir!
I wonder, what did Von Bork
pack for his departure?
Some of the information
contained in these papers
is not that valuable.
Most of them
came through my hands,you see.
German is kind of rough,
but still is the most expressive
of all European languages.
What do you think, Watson?
Tell me, Holmes,why did you ask
him for a cheque?
To make sure that not only his
shilling coins were fake
but so were the cheques.
So your plans were fake, too?
No.
No, my friend,
I had to lie to Von Bork,
but to you, I told the truth.
- "Practical Handbook of Bee Culture".
- Yes.
One thing is stil bothering me.
When and how did it happen
that you went back to work?
You see,over the last few years
as I was browsing through the press,
I became aware that some methods used
only in the criminal world in the past,
the worst kind,mind you
found a new niche, this time
in politics.
Fact is, Watson, that this gentleman
here, sleeping on the sofa
was a bit too much for our counter
intelligence.
I spent four years to get to him,
and my efforts were finally
rewarded today.
First i went to the States,
managed to become a member of the
secret Irish organization in Buffalo,
made plenty of trouble
for the local police,
and eventually caught the eye
of one of Von Bork's contacts
there
who recommended me
as a great candidate
to work in his employ.
Before you showed up, my friend,
Von Bork trusted me completely.
Truth is, it was I who tracked down and
helped capture four of his best agents.
Holmes
I long for those good old days.
All those robbers, killers,
rapists,
that you caught over the last
century
seem like innocent children
compared to the 'wolves' we've
met recently.
One can steal a million,
or kill a rich uncle,
I can understand that.
but I cannot understand
a high rank scoundrel,
who pushes millions of people to war
for the sake of a little profit.
I don't care if he is a German Baron
or an English lord.
How can we,mere mortals -
you, me, Mrs. Hudson -
stop this horror?
I don't like it at all.
What do you think about the future?
It's not so dark, is it?
I hope so, my friend.
The twentieth century has only
just begun.
