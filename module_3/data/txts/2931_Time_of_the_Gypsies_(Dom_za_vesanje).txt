TIME OF THE GYPSIES
A love movie.
You're ruining
my youth...
I've been married for 12 hours!
And this bastard is dead drunk!
They want to ruin my life and
decerebrate me with their syringes.
But I ran away.
I'm not crazy.
Ordering me to drink potions
and swallow vials!
Vials!
Binding my soul like
a performing bear!
Tying my wings!
A Wingless spirit!
My soul is free!
Free like a bird!
My soul is flying or
going back down.
My soul is crying or
laughing and singing.
When God came down to earth,
he could not deal
with the gypsies...
and took the next flight back.
It's not my fault!
Roll for daddy!
Do better!
God!
Help me for once!
Do you really exist?
I lost everything!
And not even in front of a man.
Look at this pig
I've been fattening up!
One hundred...
He's winning and he's laughing!
All right, God!
Let this dirty pig win!
But let's make a deal,
me and you.
Just let me win once
and I'll believe in you.
I swear it!
Yes. I'll believe in you.
I'll gamble my life to win
against this pig!
That's the least you can
do for the gypsies!
Do it for me instead of
helping this dirty pig!
Help me at least once!
Go sleep it off!
You ruined my wedding!
Bastard! Drunkard!
We made a deal, God!
Your house will be white
as snow with this lime.
After the house I'll go to
the doctor for my leg.
Here's the money. Take it...
I'm coming, darling.
God bless you for saving my husband.
I'm back from the market.
But I didn't sell anything.
So I'm offering you this turkey.
A modest present to
bring you good fortune.
My medical care is free.
One more... One more...
God bless you and your children.
Eat... Eat...
Perhan!
Don't cry, Danira.
Perhan!
Look what I'm bringing you!
For me?
For you alone! Yes!
You're obedient.
Grandmother loves you.
I'd give you anything.
For me alone?
Yes! You're taking care of
Danira... your little sister.
You're working hard! Hard!
I'd give you my soul...
Mama! Whose bird is it?
I just gave it to Perhan.
Perhan? What about me?
Always your grandson?
He's obedient.
Obedient!
I'm your son, not him!
There's never anything for me!
Am I a war criminal?
I'll go back to Germany!
Don't be stupid.
Stupid? Who's stupid?
Who's stupid?
I've had enough!
This for Perhan, that for Perhan..
I'm out of here!
I'm going back to Deutschland.
It's my country! Verstehen!
You and your dear Perhan
can rot here in Yugoslavia!
Leave me alone!
You dishonored me,
you bad girl!
Dishonored!
Stop hitting me!
Move, you bad girl!
Where is your Casanova of a son?
Come down!
Come down so we can talk!
Come and look what
he did to my daughter!
I'm going to pull out his eyes!
I'm gonna cut his throat!
Let go of me, old woman!
Where is he?
Find him now!
I want to see him!
Calm down!
No! Bring me this bastard
so I can skin him!
I'm gonna kill him!
I'll gut him!
He dishonored my daughter!
He filled her belly!
She's not even thirteen years old!
- There's nothing I can do about it!
- I'll kill you! Then I'll kill him!
- I'm going to kill you!
- Kill me?
- You're just a slut!
- Watch your tongue!
- It's my house!
- Go get your son!
That's enough!
Did you like it? Did you like it?
When he was
lying on you?
And you want to get money out of us?
Don't you?
You're kidding!
Your son is fucking
anything that moves!
My brothers will castrate him!
Sit down.
Okay, I'll sit down.
I want to talk to your son
face to face.
There's nothing you can do
if he wants her!
She's likes a flashing light
as soon as she sees him!
She's flirting around!
She's flirting around?
She's a real slut!
Shame on you,
you old whore!
Winged son of the sun...
Winged son of the sun...
Oh... My child!
Another one to heal?
I'm not here for that.
Mom turned the house upside down.
She wants it covered with lime
for Saint Georges day.
Winged son of the sun...
Perhan! Prepare
some lime for Azra!
The special kind!
Go...
I've come to buy some lime.
Some lime?
Fine.
Go away!
Sit down.
Who will carry such a big bag?
Me, I suppose.
Unless you'll help me.
Do you know how lime is made?
Listen to this.
Temperature is the most
important thing.
If you don't keep the
oven temperature constant...
the limestone doesn't
fire correctly.
Fire is the basis of it.
Wood is burning
and smoke goes through
the neck of the chimney.
The iron plate is made white-hot.
The limestone burns and
evaporates in the air...
Only the white powder is left.
Only God knows how much
heat is needed for that.
Do you know how to kiss?
There would be no white
houses without lime.
Plum jam would be sour.
Do you know how to kiss?
Grandma says that lime comes
from the breast of Mother Stone.
Mother Forest and Mother Stone
had an argument.
And Mother Forest bit
Mother Stone breast.
That's why lime is white as milk.
Earth gave it birth.
Water baptised it.
And Fire fed it.
Do you know how to kiss?
Like in the movies.
Stop!
How long can you kiss
without breathing?
About... fifteen, twenty minutes.
Go!
God damn!
Your lips are like a magnet.
Do you want to see something?
Look.
Look at the can.
A mirage!
Don't move!
Don't move!
Who wants to marry her?
Me.
You? Marry her?
Do you hear that?
This little idiot came
to spoil our vacation!
This scarecrow wants
to marry your daughter!
Get inside!
Azra, stay here!
Oh yes? Obey me!
Now!
I told you to stay!
And I told you to get inside!
Are you deaf?
You're killing me inches!
You're crushing me!
I'm going to pass out!
I bled myself white for you!
And now that's what I get!
And you!
You short-sighted bastard!
Raceless! And pennyless!
What are you waiting for?
Get lost now, scumbag!
And you? And you?
Are you suddenly deaf-and-dumb?
Cat got your tongue?
Mute as a grave, aren't you?
Speak!
You're hopeless!
God!
Where are you?
Help!
Somebody help me!
I'm being slaughtered!
I'm being murdered!
Somebody, help!
Gimme a minute so
I can pull out your eyes!
Murderer of his wife!
Assassin!
Help! Call the police !
The judge! The firemen!
Bastard!
God, why me?
I'll scald you alive!
Dear grandmother...
I tried to get married three times.
And I failed.
This world
isn't for me.
I'll swallow this letter
to escape the shame
of committing suicide
for a woman.
I can't live without Azra.
She's a goddess and
her mother is a harpy.
God help me!
Yours, Perhan.
I'll start a new life
if I can't jump over my shadow.
One... Two... Three...
Now!
Fuck my shadow!
The moon is smiling
but we're crying!
Azra!
Go away!
Cries are coming.
Laughter is dying!
In the stars...
our cries are flying!
Around the fire,
my shadow is dancing!
What is this cute bird
doing at this hour?
Azra!
Azra! I love you!
I'm coming!
It's politicians we should be hanging!
Come down immediately!
Come on! You fool!
It's wrong to hang yourself
in front of a church!
Open!
Open! Hatidza!
It's me, Zabit!
Come in, my friend,
may God bless you.
- Happy Saint Georges day.
- You too, if it's God's will.
Sit down.
I've brought you this Scoundrel.
I won't tell you
where I found him.
What are you doing?
I'm crying!
The girl is crying too?
Yes.
She's unhappy too!
Play some music for grandma.
I'll bring your accordion.
If you were my son and
hanged yourself...
I would kill you...
Here! Here's your accordion.
Play your grandma's favorite tune.
Outside...
It's absolutely romantic!
We could dance in the fields
if we were young!
I can still dance
with such an handsome stallion!
Not bad, isn't it?
Absolutely romantic!
You're gonna burn me!
Grandma!
Are you sleeping?
Yes! You too, sleep!
Grandma!
Come.
Was my mother very beautiful?
Yes, like a nymph in the forest.
Her belly got as big as a barrel
when she was expecting Danira.
I went to see the old seer
who said that someone had
cast a spell on her.
Her incantations weren't
of any help.
So, I decided
to take her to the mosque.
Germany is my country!
Merzan! Why didn't you go
back to Germany?
She was very sick.
The priest read the Koran
for her salvation.
In vain.
We went to a doctor.
Serious illness, pills, injections.
Nothing worked.
She dies in my arms.
So young, so beautiful...
God gives, God takes.
That's how it is.
Why am I a bastard?
Your father was
a Slovene soldier.
He was doing his
military service here.
I'm the bastard of a soldier.
Ruza was right.
May those who say that eat shit!
You're grandma's love.
Sleep now. Sleep. Sleep...
5... 4... 3...
2...1...
1... 2... 3...
4... 5...
Go back!
I don't want you today.
Watch over Danira.
Are you deaf?
Come and see who's
back from Italy.
It's Ahmed the Great,
Sheik of the Gypsies.
Come and see
who's back from Italy.
But it's Ahmed the nabob!
Nice car!
How do you do, Ahmed?
So elegant!
Your white suit is magnificent!
Wanna play cards?
At noon, usual place.
I'll be there!
Ahmed, give me a few dinars
for having escaped
from the asylum.
I come in good faith
to ask for your daughter's hand.
Get out of my sight!
Get out of here!
Faster! Come on!
It's also my grandmother's wish.
You want to marry Azra?
Do you have a job?
Is there anything you can do?
You're making objects dance!
Learn a craft...
Make money dance!
Calm down! Calm down!
My daughter is a beauty,
you're not worthy of her!
I told you a hundred times,
the answer is no!
- Go away!
- Calm down! Calm down!
Go back home!
Grandma! Come, help us!
I refused her hands to many others!
Don't devour my grandson!
Ah! Grandma...
It looks like you want him dead!
What do you want to drink?
Nothing.
I come to marry the kid.
And I'm bringing money.
Money.
As much as needed.
Here... Here...
Your grandson is worthless.
All he knows
is to make cans slide.
No banknotes!
Teach him.
You who knows everything!
Your money is useless.
My daughter is worth millions.
She's too good for all of them!
Azra! Come here!
Have a look at this
immaculate beauty!
So proud of her divine daughter!
So proud!
Yes! Have a look at her!
I'm looking! So what?
She's magnificent!
Take this good-for-nothing with you!
Get out of here, both of you!
I'll be back and
you'll kiss my feet!
You, marry my daughter?
What a joke!
I have powers!
I can cast spells!
I can do some evil!
You'll lick my feet!
Get out of here, both of you!
Keep your head high!
There's still time
to jump in the river!
Or to get married!
You're grandma's love.
Did you sell your lime?
Business is bad.
When will you pay your debt?
Tomorrow.
We're leaving tomorrow.
Where?
Where?
Where the police isn't.
Try to pay your debt.
Two cards.
Uncle!
Uncle! Uncle!
Come in quick!
Robert will suffocate!
Mama, save me!
Those bandits,
they're gonna hunt me down.
Dry yourself off and go to bed.
No! They're dangerous!
I owe them money.
Leave me.
I want to dream.
They're criminals!
I need money.
I'll help myself.
Come on! You old witch!
Give me this fucking money!
Give it to me!
Give it or I swear that
I'll kill you all!
Give it to me!
Do you hear me, witch?
I want this money!
This is your last chance!
I don't have any money.
What's mine is yours!
You, you got some in your pants!
For your wedding!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
I want this money!
Spit it, right now!
Or I'll slaughter you!
You destroyed us with
your gambling debts!
Really? Well, you'll see
what else I can destroy!
Go to hell
or give me this money now!
I don't have any, you fool!
How could I get some?
It's raining.
You're gonna demolish the house.
The little one is terrified.
Go away!
You'll see what I can do!
I'm born
without a father!
My mother was taking care of me!
Dear old mother,
never I'll forget her!
Don't cry little mother!
You'll see that I grew up.
I'll always take care of you.
As you used to take care of me.
I'm born without a father!
My mother was taking care of me!
The money!
And I'm taking the house down!
Do what you want but
get me the money!
Don't cry little mother!
You'll see that I grew up...
You lost your head...
You're good for the asylum.
A very long time ago...
Heaven and Earth
were husband and wife.
They had five children.
Sun...
Moon...
Fire...
Clouds...
And Water.
They made a cosy home
for all their children.
The arrogant Sun
tried to separate
Heaven and Earth.
But he couldn't.
The other children
failed too.
But one day...
the Wind swooped down on them,
and Earth was separated from Heaven.
Hatidza!
Come to save my son!
Quick! Lead death away!
Blood is the great secret.
Blood is the power.
Wait. His soul hasn't
awakened yet.
Merzan! My sun!
Who did that to you?
My brothers!
I saved your son and that's
how you're thanking me?
Get out of here! Go away!
I'm sorry.
Putting my son to shame like that!
My only son!
That's how you're thanking me?
I didn't know. I swear!
May earth swallow me!
I'll skin them alive for that.
I've got money on me.
Take what you want.
Keep your money.
Your family is dirty.
Be careful!
You can stuff your gratitude!
Droppings of your race!
You're lucky to have
saved my son.
I'll sort things out.
Trust your grandma.
You drew my turkey!
I'm gonna cut you open!
I don't give a fuck about the turkey!
I'll buy you a hundred!
Stop fighting!
Stop it, both of you.
Stop it, understood?
You, stay here!
- I'll offer you 300 turkeys!
- It was mine!
What are those manners?
And you, you're a monster!
What did you do?
What's gotten into you?
How nice!
Attacking your uncle!
You're just a coward!
I'll break your spine
if I catch you...
Then I'll cut your throat.
And as a dessert,
I'll pull your teeth out
one by one!
I'll crush you like
a rotten pumpkin!
How dare you raise your hand on me!
You should be
kissing my feet, you bastard!
Where are you going?
Go back to your sit.
Let's talk.
Do you want to pay for Robert?
The doctors failed.
Go on.
Do you see this young girl?
Do you see her leg?
They're stretching bones
at Ljubljana hospital...
Help her and we're even.
I'm going to Italy.
I'll make a detour
through Ljubljana.
She won't go alone.
I'm coming too.
A head of the family!
Very good!
I'll take you both.
Don't cry, Dada.
I don't want to...
go to the hospital.
I'm afraid to... die!
Don't be afraid.
Merzan! What did you do, you idiot?
Shame on you!
Leave him. He's crazy,
possessed by the devil.
My poor house!
Are you worried?
They're brave. You won't have
any problem.
Is it hereditary?
Her leg?
Your powers!
Did they inherit them?
Only Perhan. A little.
A little?
Nothing very useful.
Perhan!
Come to see the Sheik!
Show him what you can do!
Come!
Show him...
He's gonna look after your sister.
I can't.
Show him!
- Come on!
- I can't!
He's gonna take your sister
to the hospital!
Elvis! Jashar! Rambo!
Go get your instruments!
Take care of them as
if they were yours.
They're my life.
Don't worry.
We have a good driver.
She'll get Marilyn Monroe's legs.
May your grand-daughter come
back rich and healthy!
Come with us!
There's enough room for you.
How could I?
I'm old and sick.
Don't cry.
They'll look after your leg.
I'd be like to be sure of it.
I forgot the provisions!
Don't cry, Danira!
I know. It's unexpected.
Think about me when we'll be parted.
You must wait for me.
You must remain faithful to me.
I'll write soon.
I'll make you a movie star.
My sister will live with us.
Grandma too.
All right.
If you see my uncle Merzan,
will you stay out of his way?
All right.
Good.
Don't cry.
Keep your eyes clear to
watch over my betrothed.
Take better care of her
than you would of me.
I have to cry when
my heart is suffering.
Take good care of your little sister.
Yes, yes.
Irfan!
The King Wind
rushed at his Mother.
And...
Earth separated from Heaven.
Don't cry, Dada.
Be a big girl.
Promise me that you won't
leave me with them.
Yes, but don't cry.
But I'm scared.
Be brave.
Mommy!
It's our mother!
Do you see her?
- Is she beautiful?
- Very!
How does she look like?
She has hair...
eyes... a nose...
A mouth... Everything!
Here we are!
Hello, doctor!
I called you.
Yes, I remember.
Don't leave me.
She's afraid.
I told her that
when it will be over,
She'll have...
Marilyn Monroe's legs!
We'll see.
What's your name?
Danira Feric.
Danira Feric. Sweet!
Don't worry.
Comrade Tito has been treated here.
Let's examine her.
Doctor! I'm staying with her!
You're in good health.
Don't stay here.
Wait, Ahmed!
Leave us!
I'm sorry.
You must pay for the cares.
My brother will come tomorrow
to sign for the little girl.
How can you ask to stay?
Who will feed you?
Where will you sleep?
Aren't you ashamed?
Taking the place of a sick person!
I promised grandma!
And I promised to fix her leg!
And I'll do it!
Listen.
Come to Italy with me
to earn enough money
to buy a house.
Sir Ahmed, please.
Osteomyelitis. We must operate.
So?
An operation,
it costs an arm and a leg!
Perhan!
Don't leave me alone!
Come, this way.
Perhan!
Please, don't leave me alone!
Wait!
Where are you going?
You promised!
It's hard for you.
But once you'll be rich...
you'll thank me!
Where do they come from?
Bought... on the way.
Why?
Robert needed some company.
He loves to suck in group,
like puppies.
Once a man, we want
the breast for us alone!
Who would sell his own children?
Those who have to, of course!
A father with eleven children
has a mistress,
she gives him twins,
she is married too,
so they decide
to give them to me!
Look at them!
Stork delivery!
Zef! The western has started!
Where were you, motherfuckers?
Come on, strip off!
Learn your job!
Your turn!
You're next!
Fuck off!
Do you want him?
If he comes, say "ottanta".
If he answers "cinquanta",
you accept.
Go ahead.
They want to fleece me! Read!
Tax reminder for the last 6 years,
2 fines, 3 contempts of court.
I must give them everything
or they'll extradite me.
What's it got to do with me?
I must pay for your sister.
With what?
Read! You'll see!
They bled me dry!
This time,
I'm...
dead beat!
And there's Robert's hospital
bill in Florence.
I had almost forgotten it!
You must help me, kid.
Yes but honestly!
Do you know an honest job?
One at a time!
Hello, pretty!
Ah! It's good!
Thank you, thank you...
Zef!
Spit it!
Hey, Bosnian!
Jump!
Who told you to do that?
- No one.
- Untie him!
He refuses to work?
So what?
His sister won't be treated...
He won't have a house nor a wife.
Give him some money
and send him back home.
You can go get your
sister in Ljubljana.
Too bad for her!
As for you,
you can live like a dog!
Gnawing at bones on the ground!
Give him some money
so he can be on his way!
Perhan! Look!
Perhan! Look!
Dear grandmother,
I'm alive and healthy.
Don't worry about me.
I'm in Milan.
I'm leading a royal life whose
beauty and wealth would surprise you.
It's like a dream.
A vision...
It would be the greatest joy
if you were also here.
Ahmed was right,
it's easy to get rich here.
Please, watch over Azra,
make sure she has her feet
firmly on the ground
and she's not scatterbrained.
Today, I now that God has
plans for all of us.
Ahmed is a father.
He speaks Italian,
he knows everybody.
He has people everywhere.
Lawyers, magistrates,
priests, policemen.
I make
a fortune.
I'll have a house like Ahmed's.
But Italian style.
White. With a big church
painted on the side.
Don't worry about Danira.
I know that Ahmed has
the doctor in his pocket.
What present would you like?
I bought a small TV for Merzan.
The world will be at his feet.
The latest technology.
I want a very expensive
wedding ceremony.
I want them all to remember
the day of Perhan and Azra.
Your Perhan.
Where's Irfan?
Do you hear me?
Where's Irfan?
I don't know.
Where's Irfan?
He disappeared.
Imbecile!
You let him go?
Idiot!
Talk about a brother!
Out of my sight! Find him!
But where?
Anywhere!
It's your problem!
Come on, come on...
Tears?
God...
It's pointless.
What do you miss here?
Tell me!
What do you miss?
Take! White coffee,
white bread...
soft white cheese...
Golden compote, eagle eggs...
Anything you want!
Do you want some vacation?
A sick leave? Speak!
That's how you're thanking me?
How ungrateful!
I must be crazy or naive
to trust others.
Remember:
no happiness without work.
The hell with you all!
What's going on here?
Do you want me dead?
Who's the boss?
Who's giving the orders?
May God poison your blood!
Ahmed... Ahmed!
What's happening to you?
My pills...
My pills for my blood pressure...
Who's your man, me or my brother?
Bitch!
Come here...
Come here, come here...
I have a message from grandma.
Go back home...
Or a lady with silver teeth
is gonna eat you!
The lady with the silver teeth
is a victim of the wolf.
Come on! Hurry!
Don't touch me!
Go! Go! Andiamo!
Come, all of you!
I'm coming!
Come on, get out! Andiamo!
Good!
Life is beautiful, isn't it?
Everybody to the station!
Everybody to the police station,
except the sick!
Do what he says,
don't resist the cops.
It's good, kid.
It works well.
You're like a son to me.
You're like a brother to me.
Are you sending money
for my sister?
The first day of each month.
I'm also sending some for your house.
The foundations are finished.
Today...
You and Robert,
are everything to me.
Dzamila...
Come closer!
From now on...
Perhan is the boss.
Obey him!
And not my brothers, understood?
Understood.
Little sir!
Are you looking for someone?
They're mine now.
Look! Look!
Kid... Go tell Ahmed
that his brother Sadam
isn't crazy.
I won't rot
in jail for him!
I leave it
to Zef!
After all, he's the elder.
He's the one who should go.
Ciao, bello!
My brothers can
go to the devil!
Buy some other children
who will work for us.
Find a pregnant girl.
It allows us
to smuggle them in.
I'm finally an established man!
Make a selection.
Nurses, a dwarf...
God bless you.
The house being built for me...
Where is it? Can I see it?
Near mine... of course!
We're brothers, you and me.
But don't get near the
construction site.
Why?
The lawyer warned me.
The one who got your passport.
It's a fuss over there.
It's on radio and TV.
They made a movie
about children trafficking.
Don't go.
Take the Bari-Bar ferry
and go to Bosnia.
I want to see grandma, Azra,
and my sister in Ljubljana.
No, it's too dangerous!
The police is investigating.
Here are some addresses.
Go south, to Sarajevo and Tuzla.
And find me a wife.
I repudiate Dzamila.
One you like.
Not skinny or wrinkled.
Safe travel!
Bari-Bar!
Come here. Come here!
I didn't want to upset you
last time. Forgive me.
I told you I'd come back.
My god! Millions!
No need to kiss my feet!
For me?
My God, my God!
The great businessman!
He accumulated a lot
of gold and silver!
He won a fortune to put it
at my daughter's feet!
My God!
Is she married?
No, she's not married.
What could I do?
She's a woman!
She wouldn't listen.
She went gallivanting,
she had fun.
I don't know what to do with her.
I'm wondering.
I don't know what to
do with her anymore!
What about the child in her belly?
Maybe yours.
What about you?
What do you think of it?
Ask your uncle!
My God... What did you do to me?
He came, Mother...
A dark train...
He came, Mother...
A dark morning...
You drink too much!
It's pointless!
Brandy is my specialty.
But it's useless.
Alcohol makes you
soft in the brain.
Grandma...
Aren't you happy to see me?
Grandma loves you.
But what are you doing?
Don't worry, you're with me.
Somethings not right, grandma?
Thank God, I'm fine.
What about you?
Where's your sister?
In Ljubljana.
She'll come back soon.
Give me a brandy.
Why are crying?
Why is she crying?
The whore is sad.
Even whores cry.
Why wouldn't this child be yours?
I believe no one
since I started lying.
God will abandon you if
you stop believing.
This shirt?
Where does it come from? Where?
From the work of these hands.
And I built a house.
Who will live there?
You, grandma. And me.
I won't live there.
God doesn't want me to live there.
I can't live there.
No! Don't say that!
You were honest.
You're a disgrace.
What happened to you?
Tell me, grandma!
You were grandma's little one!
You're not anymore. You're rotten!
My son... I'm telling you.
Life is just an illusion
Me... Fate can take me tomorrow.
So I'm giving you back your money.
Ah! Why are you doing that?
You're hurting yourself!
My God! My God!
You're destroying yourself!
Stop the music!
You'll drive him crazy!
Step back!
Perhan! Wait!
Come back! You're drunk!
What are you looking at?
Go back to your homes!
It's my neighbour, not yours!
Light!
Scales!
Stove!
A present from the best man!
Let's open it!
Silence!
A bread!
Ah! Gold!
Here's the limousine!
The limousine!
The driver is opening the door.
The groom is helping
the bride to get off.
He's taking her in his arms!
Let's applaud!
The step-mother...
gives some bread and sugar
to the bride for a
long and sweet life.
The newly-weds are kissing!
The step-mother takes
the bride to the house.
We're slashing the groom
to give him strength!
He'll need it!
Grandmother and grandson
are dancing!
Look!
He's handsome, cultured and proud!
You're still grandma's love.
Get up! Come! Quick!
You and Ruza, find me
some lame persons.
And find a pregnant girl.
With that and Azra's baby,
I'll have two incomes.
I can't believe it.
Are you serious?
Do you really want
to sell your own child?
Misfortune will strike you!
This child isn't mine.
There'll be no bastards in my house!
I accepted to marry her
at this condition. Understood?
Here. No one must see us.
Hi!
Hi! Are you building
another house here?
If it was the case you would
see it, wouldn't you?
With God's help...
our children will go to Italy.
They'll work and get rich.
And they'll honor us.
It's their turn.
I'm old.
I can't work anymore.
Thank God they're young.
Tell me...
about Merzan.
He's lazy.
He's only interested in women
and gambling.
Do you want me?
Leave me alone.
Understood?
I'll wait.
May they come back safe and sound.
I'll see their child
and I'll be able to die in peace.
You're hurting me. Why?
You know why.
A pure race isn't a bastard!
He's working so hard!
Maybe I'm bothering you.
Forgive me for saying all this.
But talking is calming me down.
I have worries.
My worthless son is roaming
God knows where,
then comes back home
with a sorry face
and goes out to see girls.
I'm ashamed to say that.
Honestly...
I don't really know what to do
with him anymore. I really don't...
But my Perhan! May God protect him!
There's no other like him.
Fortunately,
he's not like my son...
God curses him!
If you knew what a
beautiful daughter I had!
A true beauty.
Perhan looks like his mother.
Really.
She died young.
And because of that...
I almost lost my health.
What else can I say, my friend?
This kid is my whole life.
My whole life...
Still alive?
Here, eat!
You must believe me, Perhan.
This child is ours.
I was three months pregnant
when Merzan took me.
Shut up! Don't lie!
I'm not lying.
I won't raise a bastard!
We'll sell him and we'll
have our own child! Understood?
Give me your hand.
This child is ours.
We made love during the
Saint George celebration.
That's when it happened.
I planned everything.
I know that he's a bastard.
We'll have our own child.
No need to argue any longer.
I swear that he's ours!
One second!
I'm deeply distressed.
I dreamed that you were
giving birth...
to a white bird and that...
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
You did well. But...
Where is my new wife?
You came back empty-handed?
What about my new house?
Why did you lie to me?
Did you go back there?
Where could I find you a wife?
I thought...
What did you think? What?
That you'd pick one on the way.
I don't know.
You know everything, Ahmed.
You always know everything.
Why did you lie to me?
It's Sadam who lied to me!
I sent him the money
for your house.
And it kept it all.
I had no idea.
I'm sorry but it's not my fault.
It's true!
I swear!
Believe me or go away.
And let me die.
You'll get one half of my house.
Here. Take these papers.
We'll call the lawyer
tomorrow morning.
I may not have much time left.
What about Robert?
I loved him more than my own life.
But now...
I'm not so sure.
The more I look at him...
the more I find him suspicious.
His eyes, his nose, his hands...
Nothing like me!
But we have one thing in common:
our wives cheated on us!
A boy! Congratulation!
Cover him, quick!
Look, Perhan!
A boy! A bull-calf!
May God protect him!
No, Azra! No!
No, don't die!
For the love of God! Azra!
Dear grandmother,
After all, life has no meaning.
God just punished me.
He saw me hide
my booty.
He waited until I made a fortune.
Then, he suddenly darkened
my horizon.
He sent a storm
spread out
my money
and my gold.
First he gave me happiness.
Then he punished me
by taking everything away.
I had enough gold to
build a big house.
But now,
I'm the victim
of a tragic fate.
I don't understand.
The more I try to understand,
the more my brain is muttering
and truth is getting away.
Dear grandmother,
Your words must have
become a curse.
When I said that
I wouldn't believe
anyone anymore,
you told me:
"God will abandon you if
you stop believing".
"You're not serving God or man".
It was true. And here I am.
Deceived by the man
I believed in with all my heart.
Ahmed was like a god
and a father to me.
I told you that Danira
was at Ljubljana hospital.
Now I know that evil
can confuse our minds
and make us believe what isn't.
I found out that Ahmed
kidnapped Danira for his own profit.
Dzamila!
Where is he?
- Gone.
- Where?
Who knows? He left me!
Dzamila... Tell me!
He made peace with his brothers.
They left together!
You took my sister to Ljubljana.
Where are they?
Speak or I'll kill you!
Leave him alone!
R... Rome!
Rome!
Have mercy for a poor woman...
Luck, work, love...
- Did you see her?
- No, signore!
No, niente bambina.
Fucking gypsy!
Fuck off, you gypsy bastard!
You told me not to come back
without Danira.
I searched the whole world
but Danira is nowhere to be found.
I've been looking for Ahmed
for 4 years.
Even if it takes 4 centuries, I'll
find him and tear his heart out.
My dreams have shattered.
And what's a gypsy without dreams?
A roofless church...
A silent church tower.
Your Perhan.
Danira!
Perhan!
Brother!
My God!
I finally find you!
Your leg? How is it?
Still the same.
Go on... Eat.
Do you know what happened?
What?
Ahmed's brother was lying
about the hospital in Italy.
In fact, he kidnapped me.
And he forced me...
to become a beggar for him.
The brothers made peace.
He's getting married today.
Ahmed?
Yes.
Adm you, you have a son.
He just turned 4 years old.
He looks like you.
Do you want to see him?
Perhan!
What?
- What's your name?
- Perhan, and you?
Perhan.
Liar!
It's not true!
Quick! Before Ahmed sees us!
Hug him. He's your father!
I'll be right back.
No, don't leave us.
I'm going to buy a present for
grandma and I'll be right back.
Buy her a sponge.
Don't forget my accordion!
No!
I'll be back before the
train departure. Take that.
What?
I'm sad.
Don't be stupid.
Daddy!
Perhan! Wait!
Daddy, I'm mad at you.
Why?
You won't come back.
And you won't buy me an accordion.
Gypsy’s word!
Come on, get back inside!
Get back inside!
Irfan! Irfan!
Perhan? Is that you?
I need help.
No problem.
What do you smoke?
Good cigarettes!
Go on guard.
You can count on me.
Good luck to you two!
Ahmed! Come and dance!
Oh! The little Prince!
Look, Ahmed!
But it's Perhan!
My little boy!
I'll serve you until I die.
You're my father. I love you.
Take me back or kill me.
Kill you? Why?
Punish me.
I had some bad thoughts.
Take him. Give him something to eat.
He's declining.
Who is he?
Nobody! A simpleton!
Eat some cake! Eat!
Die, squirt!
Take me to the bridge. Hurry!
I'm gonna kill you!
You spoiled my wedding!
Go away.
Go away!
You ruined my life.
Now it's my turn.
I'm gonna kill you.
Even if you change
into a bird!
Fly, you dirty bastard!
