Oh, shut up, you putz.
Ah!
<i>Young man: Hi, dad</i>.
<i>I just want you to know</i>
<i>why I'm being</i>
<i>so silent lately</i>.
Now, it's nothing personal,
but I feel it's very hard
to express myself in words.
Here is a tape which expresses
my state of mind right now.
- Ooh! Oh!
- Ooh! Oh!
- Ooh! Oh!
- Ooh! Oh!
My son, the filmmaker.
I've got to call
the sprinkler man now. Jesus!
Ah, there we are.
Mmm. Mmm.
Woman: Mr. Whiteman, what
a nice new "humpsuit."
Carmen, <i>limpie las</i>... Oh,
how do you say "candelabras"?
Candela-baras?
<i>Candelabros</i>.
Barbara, for crying out loud,
she speaks very good English.
I know that, but the next time
we go to Mexico, I intend to be
prepared for any emergen-cia.
- <i>Emergencia</i>.
- Emer-gencia.
- Where's Jenny?
- She's asleep.
<i>Vaya al</i> "marcardo."
- <i>Mercado</i>.
- Merca-do.
Family, scene one,
take one.
Preparing the feast,
my father, Dave Whiteman...
Get out of here, Max.
How do you think
Steven Spielberg got started?
How do you feel
this Thanksgiving?
How do I feel?
I'll tell you how I feel.
I feel like my son should stop
acting ridiculous on this day
when we should all be giving
thanks for our blessings.
And guilty.
Yeah, we should all be feeling
a little guilty.
People are starving
in the worid.
Guilt is useless.
Your swami tell you that?
My yogi, Ranbir.
I thought this
was a holiday.
It's the caterer
with the turkey.
Arrival of the bird.
Carmen, <i>la</i> "porta,"
<i>por favor</i>.
Why doesn't he use
the service entrance?
Sal, why don't you...
Carmen, I forgot.
Come on, come on,
let's go.
Ah, the sister, the princess,
back home from Sarah Lawrence.
Morning!
I'm going to the beach,
okay?
If Stacey calls, tell her
that I left already.
No breakfast?
I'll get something
down there.
Bye, dad.
Goodbye, Max.
All I seem to do
is wave to her.
For years, she's been nothing
but a blur with a nice smell.
Al, Al, Al...
is the bird big enough?
My father loves white meat.
Your bird's bigger
than Mel Brooks' bird,
and he's got
15 people coming, Mr. W.
Is he nice...
Mel Brooks?
Very sweet man.
Get the door!
Come on, get the door!
Let's go!
This dog is crazy!
Come on, Kerouac,
let Jerry sleep.
Hello.
You look hungry, huh?
Yeah, you want
what I've got here?
Yeah, isn't that good?
Hey...
hey, are you lost?
You don't have
a collar on, huh?
Yeah, you want
to come home with me?
My husband's
gonna kill me.
Come on.
Come on.
Yeah, come on.
That's right.
<i>Man: Let me</i>
<i>show you something</i>.
<i>This is our</i>
<i>mobile-home parks</i>.
<i>This is our San Diego park</i>.
<i>We're talking</i>
<i>about 500 units, Lou</i>.
Jenny, you want
some more meat?
<i>Jenny: I ate</i>
<i>at the beach, dad</i>.
<i>Lou:</i>
<i>What kind of people live</i>
<i>in those trailer parks?</i>
Well, we got your nice retired
people like Mel and Sadie.
And you got
your people who are sick
and tired of the rat race.
- Let them pay their rent.
- Maybe I should move in
to one of my parks.
Max: Could you hold
the photo up higher, please?
Max, Max, Max!
Stop it, Max.
You can walk
on the fire...
on the coals...
no question.
Yogi, can you teach
my daughter to eat?
That's a deeply neurotic
statement, dad. Really.
Carmen, <i>las</i> cranberries,
<i>por favor</i>.
There's no more white meat.
I told you I love white meat.
The pooch ate
the white meat.
The pooch.
<i>Barbara, next year,</i>
<i>I'm using another caterer</i>.
Make sure you give me
the receipts, Dave.
Sidney, I would like to try
and walk on hot coals.
Is that
a tax deduction, yogi...
to walk on hot coals?
Yes.
It is?
Then walk on hot coals.
I don't care.
How's your family,
Carmen?
Not so very good,
Señora Waltzberg.
My brother... he's trying to
come up here to find a job.
Mm-hmm. What does he do?
He cuts sugar cane
in the fields.
Not much call for that
in Los Ángeles.
Who asked you?
Matisse, stop that!
Neurotic-dog scene, take one.
You're the one
that's neurotic.
We're taking him to
a dog psychiatrist.
Father-and-son scene,
take one.
You know, Max,
I think it's about time
that you started learning
the hanger business
and stopped wasting time
with the camera.
I don't like hangers.
You don't like hangers?
It's hangers that clothe you,
and it's hangers that feed you!
It's hangers that pay
for the Farchadat camera,
for crying out loud!
Max, Max, talk to me.
Talk to me man-to-man.
<i>What's troubling you?</i>
<i>What is it?</i>
Perhaps we should all
meditate for a moment.
Kerouac?
Kerouac?
Kerouac!
Did you see
a little tan dog?
Kerouac?
<i>Kerouac!</i>
Anybody seen my dog?
It's a little tan dog.
I lost my little dog.
All: No.
<i>I lost my little tan dog!</i>
Kerouac!
Is he... s-somebody got him?
<i>Man: Excuse me, sir</i>.
Excuse me, you're
going to have to leave.
No!
I lost my goddamn dog!
You have to leave.
You're going to have to
leave the restaurant, yeah?
<i>Security is</i>...
Kerouac!
Well, well, well,
well, well.
- What's the problem, Jerry?
- I lost my dog.
- He lost his dog.
- That's right.
Look, I think
what you ought to do
is stop running around here
harassing people...
No, wait a minute.
My dog was stolen.
I think it was dognapped.
I understand.
It's going to be okay.
Why don't you
go downtown and
take a bath?
- Hey! Screw you.
I'm a citizen.
- Just relax.
- I'm a citizen.
- Okay. Okay.
Well, I wish you could stay
a little longer.
I'll be back at Christmas.
Maybe Jim will come home
with me.
Yeah,
I'd like to meet him.
It seems real serious.
It's hard to find someone
as nice as you, dad.
What does he do...
this Jim guy?
He's a road manager
for a rock group.
I hope he's
not a drug addict.
He smokes some grass,
you know,
and he does a little cocaine
once in a while,
but I assure you
he is perfectly normal.
Jen, I want you to tell me
that you don't do drugs.
Dad, you've got to stop
this inquisition, okay?
- Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm 19 years old.
I'm your father.
Why does mother keep
falling for all these
gurus and charlatans?
It's so '60s.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?
You haven't said anything
about the car.
It's nice.
<i>Woman: The white zone</i>
<i>is for immediate loading</i>...
"Nice."
It's not too, uh...
too Beverly Hills?
Dad, you do not
have to justify anything.
You work very, very hard
for your money.
Well, I guess I feel,
you know, a little guilty.
- Guilt sucks.
- Yeah.
- Kiss?
- Bye!
<i>The white zone is for immediate</i>
<i>loading and unloading</i>...
Maybe they'll give her
a good meal on the plane.
- I'm very worried
about Jenny.
- Why?
I think
she's an anorexic.
Anybody who doesn't snack
all day is anorexic to you.
Couldn't she go to school
in California, huh? There are
very good schools in California.
- She just wanted a change.
- Great schools.
Who is this Jim guy
anyway?
I'm sure he's
very nice, dear.
You think they're
having sex already?
Dave, don't
get yourself upset.
What does that mean?
What does that mean?
<i>Barbara,</i>
<i>what does that mean?</i>
It's a new age
for women, honey.
Barbara.
Barbara.
Do you know more
than you're saying?
I hope
she is having sex.
It's time.
You got
great shoulders, Barb.
Must be the moon.
Come on,
I'm feeling very sexy.
Who cares
what the reason is?
Dave, I...
I'm very depressed.
Come on.
Come on, my little baby.
Come on. Maybe it's too
much meditating.
Honey, I think
it's an allergy.
In fact, I'm convinced of it.
So is Ranbir.
Honey, please.
Oh, honey, please.
Maybe you're allergic
to me.
Dave,
you're such a <i>noodge</i>.
Barbara...
you happy?
I'm content.
Sometimes I wonder.
Dave, I'm changing.
That causes stress.
Why don't you take
a couple of Tylenol?
I'm not even going to dignify
that with a response.
<i>Johnny Carson:</i>
<i>The punk rockers</i>
<i>will bring Baskin-Robbins</i>
<i>ice cream. Nancy Reagan will</i>...
I'm very worried
about Max.
He seems very confused.
I saw him in a tutu
tonight.
Dave?
Dave...
that was the cherry
on the cake of my day.
Thank you.
Good night, honey.
Good night, Barb.
Oy.
<i>I can't think of a better way</i>
<i>to celebrate</i>...
A dog's supposed to be loyal,
goddamn it.
Where in the hell's
your loyalty?
You're a mutt.
You're an ungrateful mutt of a
mongrel, that's what you are,
you son of a bitch.
You wait till I get
my hands on you.
You son of a...
Kerouac!
Hmm?
<i>Go for it, putz</i>.
Oh, Mr. Whiteman. Oh.
You have to call me
Dave.
Oh, Dave.
Dave. Mmm.
Oh, I knew you would
come tonight.
<i>Señorita</i>
<i>Rosalina Mendez de Meco</i>.
<i>Oh! Oh!</i>
Oh, Mr. Whiteman.
Shut up, you putz.
<i>I hate that dog so much</i>.
Oh, trouble
at the Whiteman house.
Oh, goddamn alarm!
Cops are gonna come.
Oh,
I have no green card.
I'll take care
of this, pronto.
Max: Close encounters
of the fourth kind, take one!
My house! My house!
My house!
No problem! No problem!
It's okay!
No robbery! Don't worry!
Don't worry, that's okay.
There's no robbery at all.
Well, we'll take a look around
anyway, Mr. Whiteman.
- You never know.
- Sorry, Mr. Whiteman.
Lance, Lance,
what the hell...
why do these things
keep happening?
Could be
the change in humidity
or some animal.
Some animal? I'm gonna need
an alarm for the alarm.
<i>Get your hands</i>
<i>off of them guns!</i>
I'm Orvis Goodnight!
Record producer,
you understand?!
I live right across
the street from this place!
But I don't get
this kind of service,
no, sir!
Two weeks ago, a thief tried
to break in my house!
<i>Called the police</i>...
<i>good God almighty!</i>
It took 20 minutes for
the policemen to arrive!
One little car!
No dog! No chopper!
And I know why I don't get the
protection I am supposed to get!
Because I'm black!
Black! I'm a black man!
Ain't no black man supposed
to live in Beverly Hills!
<i>Let one black man stop</i>
<i>to tie his shoes</i>
or scratch his behind
on Rodeo Drive...
<i>the S. W.A. T. Team</i>
<i>would parachute</i>
<i>all down over my brother!</i>
I spent $3.6 million
for that pile of stucco
you see over there!
I want the <i>same</i> protection...
the <i>same</i> protection
that you give old
David Whiteman over there!
<i>And I'm bringing in</i>
<i>more brothers</i>...
more brothers!
Whoo, whoo!
I'm gonna sue you, Whiteman!
This dog is a killer dog!
Matisse!
<i>He's gonna kill somebody!</i>
Max, stop it and come in,
please!
All right,
thank you very much.
Sorry, Mr. Whiteman, we...
first thing in the morning.
Take care of it as soon
as you can. Sorry to cause
you all the trouble.
All right, all right. Get that
helicopter out of here, please!
Kerouac!
Kerouac!
<i>Bueno</i>.
<i>Bueno, Jesus</i>.
No. No, no, no,
<i>muy bueno, Jesus</i>.
I'll come down
in a couple of days
so that I can wish
all the <i>hombres</i>...
Barbara, how do you say
"happy new year" in Spanish?
<i>Feliz año</i>.
<i>Feliz años</i>. Okay?
Yeah, <i>sí</i>. No, no, no,
just, uh...
me and my, uh...

Hold on. Hold on.

Come here!
Dave! Help! Help!

Over here, Dave!
I got him! Here, Dave!
<i>I got him! I got him!</i>
<i>I got him!</i>
Here, hold him!
He's got rocks in his pocket.
Man: Hello?
Operator! Operator!
Oh, my God. I called 911.

CPR! CPR!
Yeah.
Don't! Dave, you'll catch AIDS

Oh, my God!

<i>Dave: Carmen, Carmen, Carmen!</i>
<i>Get me some blankets! Get some</i>

Quick! Quick! All right,

to the chaise lounge.
Come on! Come on,

<i>There we go. There we go</i>.
<i>Hold him steady</i>.
<i>There we go</i>.
The dog killed somebody.
I told you.
Okay, okay. Here, ta...
drink this. Drink this.
Oh, Christ,
you got any Courvoisier?
He must be in shock.
Go on, drink.
How long was
he in the water?
Not very long.
I gave him CPR.
He saved him...
<i>muy macho</i>.
Would you please
check my husband?
He had his lips
on this man's lips.
- Good work.
- Thank you.
You feeling any better?
What gives, <i>amigo?</i>
- "What gives"?
You almost drowned.
- I know that.
Nobody drowns
in my backyard.
Aw, Christ,
if I'd have known that,
I'd have gone somewhere else.
How did he get
in the yard? I didn't
hear the alarm.
- I don't know. Barbara!
- I'm going to call Lance,
Brad, the pool man.
I'm going to make him check
the water for bacteria.
Barbara, I knew that lifesaving
class would come in handy.
Didn't I? Huh? I knew it.
I knew it. Look at that.
He's just drunk
and disgusting.
What are you talking about?
He's a human being.
Where's your sense of charity?
A drunk, disgusting
human being, and don't
talk to me about charity.
I volunteer
three days a week
at the free clinic.
I am shocked at you, Barbara.
I am really, really shocked,
you know?
There but for the grace
of God go you or I.
Oh, no, dear, not me.
I would never sink so low.
I'd kill myself first.
- Look, I have aerobics
in 50 minutes.
- Go, go!
- I have brunch with Sheila
at Neiman-Marcus.
- Who's stopping you?
Go right ahead.
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you're all right?</i>
<i>I'm fine</i>.
You are a hero,
you know.
I'm just a scaredy-cat.
Listen, maybe the police
could take him to the rescue
mission or something.
He does look pitiful.
Barbara, it's okay.
You can go to lunch, all right?
- Thanks.
- All right.
Yep, there you are.
Look, I'll tell you what...
why don't you leave him
with me, okay?
I'll take care of him.
- Okay.
- All right.
Thanks a lot.
See ya.
Shut up.
Shut up, you putz!
You think
you can get up?
Yeah.
Okay. Carmen,
give me a hand.
Matisse, get down,
you rotten...
Come on. That's it.
Come on. There you go.
That's it.
So... what's your name?
Esther Williams.
My name is Dave Whiteman.
Jerry M. Baskin.
What's the "M"
stand for?
This your place?
Yeah, yeah.
What are you,
a gangster?
No.
No, I make hangers.
Here, why don't you
put this on?
Carmen, give me a hand here,
all right?
Here, give me your drink.
Why don't you take some
of these wet things off?
I- I don't like this.
You got a terry cloth...
Excuse me, that is
a brand-new robe, you know.
"Brooks Brothers."
I used to shop there.
Carmen, why don't you take
some of these wet things
into the washer, okay?
Dave...
And don't
throw that stuff out.
Mr. Whiteman!
Carmen, listen to me,
please, Carmen.
Please, in the washer.
Come on. Give me a break.
Is that, uh...
help him, uh...
Ohh... oh!
<i>Dios mío</i>.
Here, you want me
to help you out?
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right, then.
Yeah. Whoa, whoo-oa!
Hooo-oa!
<i> Get a grip</i>
<i>on there. Here</i>.
Ah!
Carmen.
Give me the robe.
Yeah. Yeah.
Thank you.
Carmen. Carmen. Carmen.
Want something to eat?
What do you got?
Uh... turkey.
You know,
all the stuff that's
left over from Thanksgiving.
Got any white meat?
Caterer really stinks,
you know?
Who made this dressing?
<i>My mother</i>.
Too much onion.
<i> You could</i>
<i>at least say "thank you."</i>
For what?
For the food.
Thanks.
For...
for saving your life.
Are my clothes dry?
Soon.
You...
you can keep the robe.
You might ask me
to thank you again.
You're pretty tough, huh?
Can I ask you a question,
Jerry?
How did you get...
I don't want to use
the word "low,"
but, uh...
what happened to you?
I mean, you're obviously
a very intelligent guy.
<i>I was pretty active</i>
<i>politically in the '60s</i>.
Sold some draught cards.
They nailed me for counterfeit
government documents.
They give me 45 years
and a $ 75,000 fine.
Suspended it and put me under
the Youth Correction Act.
I was a felon.
So, fuck it,
I got into acting.
Show business. Hmph.
There was this girl
in the class.
She split.
She was beautiful.
She was one in a million.
You've seen her.
Who?
Linda Evans.
<i>TV</i> Linda Evans?
- "Dynasty"?
- No, it was
before "Dynasty."
Can I get some more
cranberry sauce?
- Oh, yeah.
- No, no, I'll get it.
It was between
"The Big Valley" and "Dynasty,"
you know, in that period.
Anyway, we broke up.
Carmen?
I was in bad shape
for about a year.
But that didn't do it,
really.
I used to drink a lot,
and I did a lot of drugs.
Thank you.
Then my sister... my little
sister... died of leukaemia.
<i>We were real close</i>
<i>'cause we were orphaned</i>
<i>so young together</i>.
That's what did it.
So, I lost, uh...
<i>I lost my, uh</i>...
incentive.
So, I didn't
care about myself,
so I learnt to survive
on the street, you know?
Sorry.
Yeah, well, I gotta go.
<i>Where you gonna go?</i>
I don't know.
<i>¿Quién sabe?</i>
- Hey! Hey!
Hey, hey! Jerry!
You're not gonna pull
that swimming-pool stunt
again, are you?
Mind if I take
one of these grapefruit?
Don't want scurvy,
you know.
No, no, no, go ahead.
Hey, hey, all right,
all right, just a minute.
Look, listen to me.
Listen to me. Look.
Look, just listen.
Look, look, look.
You're gonna stay here
until you straighten out, okay?
No ifs, no ands,
no buts, okay?
- You can sleep right there
in that cabana. All right?
- Cabana?
Yeah. All right, come on,
come on, help out here!
Just... that's it.
Okay? All right, no ifs,
no ands, no buts.
That's it,
give me a hand.
Come on. Come on, let's just
go over here. Right there.
<i>That's it. There we go</i>.
<i>There we go</i>.
<i># Roll down the window,</i>
<i>put down the top #</i>
<i># Crank up</i>
<i>the Beach Boys, baby,</i>
<i>don't let the music stop #</i>
<i># We're gonna ride it till we</i>
<i>just can't ride it no more #</i>
Hello, darling.
<i>Barbara: Hi</i>.
Can I give you a hand?
The Betty Ford clinic
wouldn't take a dog.
Did the pool man come?
No, but the sprinklers
are going crazy.
Oh, honey, that was
a very brave thing
you did this morning.
I told all the giris
in class.
- So, what happened
to the poor guy?
- He's in the hot tub.
- He's still here?!
- Yeah.
What's the emergency number?
911?
No, no, Barbara,
I invited him to stay
for a couple of days.
He is not
staying in my house.
He's not in the house.
He's in the cabana
out by the pool.
I'm calling Sidney.
You need immediate treatment.
Barbara, come on. You're
overreacting to this a little
bit, don't you think?
You don't know
a thing about this man!
He is a bum, a derelict!
His sister
died of leukaemia!
I know something
about him, okay?
- He could steal everything...
- His name is Jerry.
And then murder us in our beds!
Is that what you want...
another Manson murder?
Barbara,
Matisse loves him. Look.
That should be a clue right
there. Matisse loves no one.
Look for yourself.
Stay. Stay.
Walk.
Okay, good boy!
<i>Good boy!</i>
He's gonna give
that dog fleas.
Isn't that something?
And it'll be <i>your</i> fault.
Oh, come on,
look at that.
Barbara!

in three years.
Uh, you'll, uh,
you'll like this.
It's one of my...
one of my specialties.
All right.
Okay, it's the, uh...
it's the onions
and the tomato that
does the trick.
Oh. I haven't had
one of these
since my Brooklyn days.
Are you from Brooklyn?
Flatbush Ave.
- No kidding!
- Yeah.
Huh. I grew up around
Ebbets Field.
Yeah?
Boy, I loved baseball
back in those days.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.
You remember, uh,
you remember Duke Snider?
- Oh!
- Yeah, he was my idol.
- Roy Campanella, huh?
- Yeah.
Carl Erskine,
there was a tough cookie.
Hey, you remember...
you remember Ralph Branca?
Oh!
The right-handed pitcher,
huh? Remember him?
- Yeah.
- Mmmm-boom!
Barney Thompson
that time?
Pete Reiser?
Remember, he ran into
the centre field? Oh!
Tough day.
- 57 th season, Drysdale
won us 17 games!
- 17 games!
- 17 games.
- 17 games.
That was amazing.
That's the year
they moved the team.
Yeah. Whew!
I was that big. Hmm.
I cried.
How 'bout
that low-cal root beer?
- Low-cal?
- Right.
You got it.
- Hey, Jerry...
- Hmm?
Do you ever think
about going straight,
you know, getting a job?
Oh, come on, Dave,
I've tried it.
I played the game.
I tried, I lost.
Now, you get tired
of playing a losing game.
What are you talking
about? All you need is
a little luck, buddy.
Come on, look at me.
I'm serious.
Look at me.
I was selling lingerie
from the back seat of
my father's Oldsmobile.
Look, you gotta be
in the right place
at the right time.
<i>You understand</i>
<i>what I'm saying to you?</i>
<i>I went into a bar</i>
<i>in New Jersey, I struck up</i>
<i>a conversation with a guy</i>.
What does he do for
a living? He's putting up
a string of motels.
So I borrowed some money
from my Uncle Maurie.
What, do you think
I knew I was gonna be
in the hanger business?
The rest is history.
What is this,
an all-night diner?
Hi, Barb.
You eating again, Dave?
Well, it's <i>your</i> colon.
And don't drop food
on the floor
and make a mess
for me to clean, please.
<i>I thought</i>
<i>I heard a rat</i>.
Maybe that's
what I heard.
A lot of rats here
in Beverly Hills.
Rats are everywhere.
Dave, I-I think I'd like
to talk to Jerry alone.
Sure, Barb.
<i>Well, come, Jerry</i>.
I missed you.
Just sit... anywhere.
Jerry, I'd like to apologise
to you for how I've behaved.
You have to know
I've objected to
your presence here.
<i>Frankly, your appearance</i>
<i>scares me. I</i>...
there's something very
threatening about you.
Um, I realise that this is
completely superficial
and that underneath
all that,
you are undoubtedly
a wonderful person
with wonderful
human qualities.
I want you to know
that I'm trying so hard
to overcome
my middle-class prejudices.
You know, my... my yogi,
my guru, my guide Ranbir
always says
that we are all part
of the same oneness,
the same universal
electric tide.
We flow into and out of
everything.
So, as a human being,
I- I want you to know
that I respect you, I do,
and I-I hope
you understand me.

- Your first, uh...

No, I had one

- You lived in London?
- Graduate school.
What kind
of hangers you make, Dave?
Here, here, check it out.
There we go.
<i># Tutti frutti, oh, rutti #</i>
"Congratulations
to Mr. Dave Whiteman,
<i>"President of Dav-Bar</i>.
"This gold hanger honours your
sale of one million hangers
to the Holiday Inn."
The baby that revolutionised
the business.
See, you got
a magnetic lock.
We make that baby
in my plant in Tijuana.
Good mornin', Dave.
Morning, Orvis.

- The gentleman

- Indeed.
You have the look of
the vagabond, <i>monsieur</i>...
<i>très, très chic</i>.
Sit down.
What I was thinking of,
Maurice,
was that you ought to just,
you know, clean him up.

<i>Dave:</i>
<i>500, 000 hangers a day</i>.
<i>You know what that means,</i>
<i>500, 000 hangers a day</i>
<i>at 4 cents a hanger?</i>
<i>And we don't have</i>
<i>any salesmen</i>...
<i>do you know</i>
<i>what that means?</i>
<i>That's the beauty part</i>.
Hey, Bobby!
Good to see ya.
Yeah, this is where
Dav-Bar started.
A lot of hangers.
Hey, Raymondo!
Right now,
we're negotiating
with the Chinese.
We're gonna have
a very big party
New Year's Eve
for the minister of trade,
Mr. Chao,
and his whole group.
You know what that
could mean, don't ya?
850 million Chinese...
200 million hangers
every year, minimum.
The Chinese are
very neat people.
Yeah, you hardly ever see
a Chinese bum.
You want a job, Jer?
You give me the word,
I'll give you...
I'll give you
a job tomorrow.
What do you say?
Start you on the line,
get your feet wet in shipping.
Not really my line,
Dave.
You kill me, I swear.
You know we got
a very good health plan?
Just put in
comprehensive dental.
Alesio, Alesio...
how are you?
Show him your teeth.
<i>See? You gotta worry about</i>
<i>things like that, Jer</i>.
Can we grab some lunch?
Sure, sure.
You know,
when your teeth go,
well, you know
what I'm talking about.
Would you like another bottle
of Beaujolais, Mr. Whiteman?
Ah, what do you say,
Mr., uh, Mr. Baskin?
No.
Could use another piece
of chicken, though.
Didn't I see you
at the Cannes Film Festival?
Probably.
You were
with Susan Sarandon.
Something to do
with Nicaragua.
Are you a Sandinista?
No, no.
Wait, I know now.
You're Sandy Kinney's boyfriend.
You're a writer.
What's your name?
Jerry Baskin.
That's right.
Oh... Roxanne Philobosian.
How do you do?
Dave Whiteman.
Hi.
I'm over at MGM now.
Call me if you get
any story ideas.
We're really looking.
Oh...
Here's my card.
Oh, say hello to Sandy
for me.
Bye, Dave.
So you're a writer?
Al! Al!
<i>Hey, Al! Al!</i>
<i>Come here!</i>
<i>Yeah, come here</i>.
<i>Come here</i>.
Al...
Al, it's me... Jerry.
Jerry!
All right! All right!
Can Al join us?
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
He's a human being
just like you and me.
- Come on, why don't you,
uh...
- Come on over.
You sure it's okay?
Yeah, yeah,
come right on around.
<i>Yamato, could we have</i>
<i>another chair?</i>
<i>Thank you very much</i>...
<i>very much, thank you</i>.
<i>Thank you so much</i>.
Sit down right here.
- Dave Whiteman.
- Hey, brother... Al.
Hi. Hi, nice to meet you.
That's it. There we go.
Man, you sure look
different.
Well, it's the hair,
the beard.
I hardly recognised you.
Christ, I thought
I was hearing voices.
Would you like
something to eat?
No, thank you.
Are you expecting any more
in your party?
Oh, no, no,
here, Yamato.
Here, here,
just take... take it.
Thank you, thank you.
Would you like some,
uh, some wine?
No, this is one of
my nondrinking days.
<i>Al was down at the mission</i>
<i>with me</i>.
You, uh, remember
Red Turner?
You know, redhead cat
with the glasses.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
He got mugged real bad,
man.
He down
in the county hospital.
Red was pretty old,
Al.
They make a very good
club sandwich here, Al,
if you'd, uh...
You're sitting pretty.
Goddamn.
Lookin' good, baby, yeah.
I got to go.
<i>Uh, if you don't mind me</i>
<i>saying so, Jer, uh</i>...
some of these guys on
the street seem a little crazy.
Ah, Matisse,
what a lovely dog you are...
such a pretty dog.
<i>And such pretty eyes</i>
<i>you have</i>.
<i>What a lovely dog</i>.
I hear you're not eating,
Matisse.
Dr. Von Zimmer has
some food for you.
Here you are.
Oh, Matisse...
Oh, Matisse,
you're very angry, aren't you?
- Shh!
- What? What? What?
- Dr. Von Zimmer is here.
- Oh, are you ever angry.
Did the dog bite
the coloured guy?
Matisse hasn't eaten
in three days.
We got an anorexic dog.
You mean you've got
a <i>disturbed</i> dog.
Something's bothering
Matisse,
and Matisse
is very angry.
The dog is a loser.
Oh, what a way to talk about
a beautiful dog like this.
<i>What a way to talk</i>.
<i>He's just disturbed</i>
<i>and angry</i>.
Has there been something
new in the household,
some new
living arrangement?
We have a houseguest.
How long are you staying?
<i>He's staying</i>
<i>as long as he likes</i>.
And if the doggy
doesn't like it,
then the doggy can find
new arrangements.
Oh, well...
the hostility in
your voice, you know,
affects animals,
and the dog picks up
on it.
What this dog needs is
love and reassurance,
- And he needs love and
reassurance from you.
- Mm-hmm.
He's the one that has
the problem... with you.
You must go and caress
this dog
and hold him, hug him,
give him some affection.
- Pardon me?
- Dave...
you must go over
and caress the dog.
Oh, come on, the dog is
running the whole house!
You gotta hold this dog.
This dog needs reassurance,
needs love, attention.
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.
I like you.
Dog, I like you.
I mean, real affection,
not pseudo affection.
Nice, nice, I like you.
You're nice.
I mean, give the dog a hug.
Give the dog a hug.
He needs reassurance,
needs to be held,
needs to be touched.
Come give him a hug.
- Give me a break here!
- Well, get with it.
Nice dog.
<i>Nice dog, all right?</i>
<i>You're a very nice dog</i>.
When your guest leaves,
Matisse will eat.
He'll be voracious.
He'll be okay.
I wouldn't worry
about that.
But he has other problems.
I believe he suffers
from nipple anxiety.
Probably came
from a 9-dog litter.
Now, about my fee...
<i>Jerry: Listen to this,</i>
<i>Matisse</i>.
<i>"If your dog has a fit,</i>
<i>"he runs around aimlessly,</i>
<i>barking hysterically,</i>
<i>"starry-eyed,</i>
<i>foaming at the mouth,</i>
<i>"completely beyond control</i>
<i>till he finally collapses,</i>
<i>exhausted</i>.
"Often defecating
and urinating,
"he becomes
stiff and starry-eyed,
"clamping his jaws,
foaming at the mouth,
<i>"staggers and falls</i>
<i>on his backside</i>
<i>"with his legs pumping</i>
<i>convulsively in the air</i>...
"The fit is not a disease,
but a sign
that something is wrong"?
Bullshit.
<i>Matisse! He's just trying</i>
<i>to say hello</i>.
Hello. Thank you.
Are you Iranian?
Yes, but we live here now
in Beverly Hills.
Me too.
My name is Jerry.
I am Amir.
You want an apple,
Amir?
Oh, thank you, Jerry.
Here, catch.
Matisse! Stop that
or I'll call Dr. Von Zimmer!
I was listening
to what that psychiatrist
said about your dog.
Dr. Von Zimmer seems to
think you're the problem.
Could be.
Matisse is a picky eater.
I've tried everything.
I bought him every kind
of dog food there is.
Where do you keep it?
In the cupboard
by the fridge.
Oh, Mighty Dog
corned beef.
There.
You see, your dog,
<i>this</i> dog thinks it's human.
There are no dogs around
to teach it,
so it's got no dog friends,
no dog family,
nothing to relate to.
So it thinks human
and wants to eat
what you're eating...
not that stuff you eat.
Taste's important.
Got a bowl?
Yes. Certainly.
Ah, Mighty Dog's good.
That gourmet pup
you got, that's way,
way, way too salty.
- How do you know?
- This is nutritious.
It's got all your minerals,
all your vitamins,
all your requirements.
There were many a day
I wished I had a plate
of Puppy Chow to munch on.
People treat their dogs
better than humans.
<i>That's 1/3 Mighty Dog,</i>
<i>1/3 Kal Kan with liver</i>.
<i>And you use some Puppy Chow</i>
<i>to add texture,</i>
crunchiness.
And he put the bowl
on the floor,
and he put his nose in it,
and he ate it like it was pâté
from Maxim's of Paris.
- Didn't I tell you?
- What?
He has a kind of,
uh, wisdom.
Oh, please.
I still don't trust the guy.
Oh, uh, I gave him
the burglar-alarm code
just in case.
Why didn't you give him
a credit card while
you were at it?
Speaking of that,
Carmen told me
that it would be a lot
easier for her to shop
if you gave her
her own Master Charge.
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, maybe Jerry and Carmen
will invite us over for dinner
one night.
Does the concept "schmuck"
mean anything to you, Dave?
Good night, Barbara.
<i>Johnny Carson:</i>
<i>Look, we, uh</i>... <i>yes, I do</i>.
<i>I have spares here</i>.
<i>Somebody cooked my chicken</i>.
Hey, Jerry.
How you doin'?
Yeah, got my packet?
Yeah, packet.
Checkin' in for a while?
No. No.
Do I have any mail?
Yeah, you got
book-of-the-month club.
Ah.
You look pretty sharp.
Hey, thanks
for holding this.
- Did you hear about
Red Turner?
- <i>No</i>.
- He caught a cab.
- <i>Red was pretty old</i>.
79.
Yeah. Come on.
Good morning.
Here, sign down there
at the bottom.
You got a licence?
Yeah.
You drive.
Where to?
I don't know.
Some days you just
want to take off.
Yeah. All right,
let's hit the beach.
I got some friends
down there.
The beach? Who's
gonna run my business?
Who's gonna pay my bills?
Come on, you gotta be
kidding me.
You know what
my monthly nut is?
Do you have any idea
how much it costs
to run my business?
You got enough money
to last 10 lifetimes.
Well, maybe I ought to be
a bum, you know?
The more hangers,
the more responsibilities.
You wouldn't last
a half-hour.
You think so?
Hit the beach, buddy,
pronto.
So, it's like the '60s.
Tom Tom!
<i>Jerry! Damn,</i>
<i>look at you, man</i>.
<i>You look like</i>
<i>a damn yuppie or something</i>.
Good to see you, buddy.
Hey, this is my friend.
This is my friend, Dave.
Hey, you want
a drink, white man?
There you go, yeah.
How'd he know my name?
Hey, look here.
This is my good buddy...
my good buddy, Big Ed,
and Peaches here.
Big Ed, hi.
Peaches, hi.
And on the guitar
is my friend, Patrick.
- Patrick, how are you?
- Fine.
And that's my lady,
Dorothy.
Dorothy,
how do you do?
I do fine.
How do you do?
Drink it up.
Drink it up.
- Yeah, drink up.
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, Jerry.
All right. Yeah.
Tom Tom, huh?
That's your real name?
Hell, no. My real and true name
is Daniel Whitefeather.
Whitefeather... that's
a very beautiful name.
Yeah, beautiful.
My Indian name
is Nanatatche.
"Nanatatcheta."
<i>Yeah, it means</i>
"He who lost
his American-Express card
and don't give a fuck."
Right! Yeah!
That's very funny.
You liked that one,
huh?
Yeah.
Drink up, man.
Merry Christmas! Shit!
Oh, hell.
One more time!
<i>All: # We are the bums #</i>
Everybody, sing!
<i># We are the homeless #</i>
- Hello?
- <i>Hello</i>.
Oh, Dave! Oh!
Are you all right?
What happened?
I called the police,
I called your parents,
I called Sidney.
<i>I'm okay</i>.
Barb, I'm at the beach
with Jerry...
And, uh, I've decided to
spend the night.
Dave, are you drunk?
I'm okay. There's
nothing to worry about.
I'm at the beach.
I'm with Jerry
and his friends, uh,
Patrick and Tom Tom
and Ed
and... and...
and Dorothy.
Dorothy who?
I'll see you <i>mañana,</i>
Barbara.
I knew that bum
was trouble.
<i>Jerry: Hey, Dave</i>...
<i>Yeah?</i>
<i>How long you been</i>
<i>diddlin' Carmen?</i>
<i>What are you</i>
<i>talking about?</i>
<i>Come on, it's okay by me</i>.
<i>She's a hot little number</i>.
Barb's a handsome woman,
too.
Hey, do you know how long
I've been married to Barbara?
No.
Forever.
- You ever been married?
- Twice.
You know how sometimes
you get stuck
in the horse latitudes
now and then, you know?
Yeah.
- Dead calm in the water?
- Yeah.
You need
something to, you know...
You need
a little hot sauce.
Yeah, spice it up
a little bit.
Barbara ought to have
a fling, too.
I'm serious.
It'd do her good, get her
started again, you know?
Yeah.
I love her, you know?
I believe you.
I believe you, Dave.
On the <i>emiss,</i>
tell me something.
Yeah?
You really been married
twice?
Nah.
I was just...
I was just kiddin' ya.
Are you really an actor?
<i>"What a piece of work</i>

This disgusting derelict

Barbara, I spent
the night last night
with some poor, oppressed
human beings, okay?
And they live like animals,
but they have great capacity
for joy, Barbara.
I was panic-stricken.
You had no right to do it!
I- I ate garbage
last night, Barbara,
and I loved it.
Great! You can have garbage
for dinner tonight, too!
Barbara, Barbara, I learned
to beg last night.
A total stranger gave me
50 cents, put it right there
in my hand.
What do you think
of that, huh?
I think I'll take a shower
and grab some breakfast.
You are pushing me
to my limits, both of you.
Shower in the cabana.
You want to hit
the beach, <i>amigo?</i>
<i>Woman: Walter, that's really</i>
<i>a difficult problem, incest,</i>

<i>If you'll hang on, we'll give</i>
<i>you some numbers to refer to</i>.
<i>You'll get</i>
<i>some further help</i>.
<i>Okay, let's try to</i>
<i>take one more call</i>
<i>before the hour's up</i>.
<i>Hello</i>.
Uh, my name is Dawn,
and I live in Toluca Lake.
I'm 26 years old.
<i>We have Dawn from Toluca Lake</i>.
<i>Hello, Dawn</i>.
Dr. Grant,
I'm a nervous wreck.
My husband has brought
a bum home to live with us.
<i>That sounds like a very</i>
<i>uncomfortable situation</i>.
<i>Is this a displaced person?</i>
<i>Yes, a street person</i>...
<i>a vagrant!</i>
<i>And he lives with you?</i>
<i>Yes</i>.
<i>He lives in my house</i>.
<i>In the cabana</i>
<i>out by the pool</i>.
<i>Well, this is starting to sound</i>
<i>like a real problem,</i>
<i>at least for your husband</i>.
<i>Is your husband</i>
<i>a happy man, Dawn?</i>
<i>Not lately</i>.
<i>It's possible, Dawn,</i>
<i>that your husband is living</i>
<i>a vicariously freer life</i>
<i>through the presence</i>
<i>of this displaced person</i>
<i>he's brought home</i>.
<i>Have you thought about that?</i>
<i>Well, let's not talk</i>
<i>about him right for now</i>.
<i>How's</i> your <i>personal</i>
<i>relationship with him</i>...
<i>your sex life?</i>
What sex life?
<i>Well, I see we need to talk</i>
<i>a little bit more</i>.
<i>Let's take a break</i>
<i>for a commercial</i>.
Another headache?
It's chronic.
Where'd you learn that?
At an ashram in Oregon.
You were in an ashram?
Yep.
Maybe I can help you
with your headache.
I doubt it.
Maybe.
Hello? Dr. Grant?
<i>Hello?</i>
Yes, my name is Bob. I'm
27 years old, and, uh...
I'm no longer
attracted to my wife.
<i>How long have you</i>
<i>felt this way, Bob?</i>
About
nine-and-a-half years.
<i>Was it ever any good?</i>
No, it was great.
It was fabulous.
It was my whole life.
- <i>What changed?</i>
- I don't know.
She started decorating
the house,
she's always
in a class somewhere.
What?!
You stupid son of a bitch!
<i>Hey, Mr. Rolls-Royce,</i>
<i>you know what you just did</i>
<i>to my car?!</i>
<i>You know what</i>
<i>you have done, sir?!</i>
What are you,
some kind of moron?!
<i>Policeman: Sir, may I see</i>
<i>your driver's licence, please?</i>
<i>Uh, yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>yeah, yeah, yeah</i>.
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
who... who hit who?
May I see your
driver's licence, please?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
I'm just trying to
figure out w-who I'm mad at.
I- I'm not... I-I'm...
I'm gonna have to ask you to
step out of the car, please.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Ho, ho.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Did I hit you or did you...
...<i>smashing all over</i>
<i>the street there</i>.
Listen...
<i>at the ashram,</i>
<i>we learnt</i>
<i>some massage techniques</i>...
specifically
Balinese massage.
Now, it's very powerful.
I really don't think so.
I'm a little tense.
A little tense.
I'd say you're rigid.
I'm angry at you,
and I'm angry at Dave
for going off with you.
Uh-huh.
That's understandable.
But you've got to learn
to release your anger.
You've got to just
let it go.
I had acupressure,
but it didn't work.
Well, of course not.
That's the wrong karma.
See, headaches
are mostly related
to the build-up of tension
and anxiety. Now...
Ow!
Good, good, good. Come on.
Now lie down, lie down.
- Lie down.
- No.
No, come on, lie down.
Lie down. Lie down.
All right, now, listen.
You have to learn to release
your anxiety and your tension.
It's very difficult for me
to release my anxiety.
I understand.
All right.
First, I'm gonna use
my aura.
I'm afraid.
No, don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
It's all right.
It's all right.
I want you to breathe
with me now. You ready?
Breathe in...
...out.
Oh, good.
In... out.
Oh, good.
In... out.
Good, good, good.
All right.
Good, good, good.
That's good, good.
All right.
All right. Okay.
Okay.
Give me this leg.
Just give it to me.
That's good.
All right, you ready?
Yeah.
Aaaaah!
<i>Good, good</i>.
<i>Good, that's your body</i>
<i>letting up</i>.
Oh! I think I see your aura.
You have nice skin.
Thank you.
Oh, God... I'm so relaxed.
All right. Ready?
Something strange
is happening to me.
I'm scared.
- Oh, that's all right.
- I'm scared.
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.
That's just your body
letting it all go.
Now just let it...
let it go.
Let it go.
Just let it go.
Let it go.
Oh! Oh!
Jerry, invade me.
Jangle me.
I need it, please!
Don't stop!
Don't deny me!
Aagh! Aaagh!
Aaaaagh!
Aaaagh!
<i>Aaaaaaaaagh!</i>
Whoo-wee! My Lord!
<i>Ohhhhhhh!</i>
My Go-o-o-o-d!
<i>Ohhh-ohhhhh!</i>
<i>La 'illah ha, illa allah!</i>
How long do you think
this is gonna take?
I got hit here,
I got it in the back,
I got it... Oy.
I just take 'em in, sir.
I don't fix 'em.
I haven't had an orgasm
like that
in nine-and-a-half years.
I never thought
I was capable of this.
I'm ashamed of myself.
I am.
Glad and ashamed,
exhausted and exhilarated
all at the same time,
just as I was repelled
and attracted to you
at the same time.
Yin and yang,
you understand?
Yeah, it's just
one of those things.
Dave lost interest in me,
and I lost interest
in sex.
I went shopping
for gratification.
But that's like sex
without a climax, you know?
Mmm.
God, I'm so loose.
Ahh.
All the meditation,
all the yoga never got me
to this place.
You know...
I'm well aware
of what's going on
between Dave and Carmen.
<i>You see, I thought his</i>
<i>confidence needed building,</i>
<i>and I thought she could</i>
<i>invigorate him for me</i>.
<i>But all that time,</i>
<i>I was denying myself</i>.
<i>What power, what heat</i>
<i>building up inside of me</i>
<i>like a volcano</i>.
And you unleashed it...
you.
Oh, Jerry.
Jerry, I'm so glad to be back
in the real worid again.
Poor Dave.
He's a passionate,
sweet man.
You found my "G" spot,
but this was a one-time
trip to the moon.
It happened, and
there's nothing we can
do about it now.
<i>But no matter</i>
<i>how fantastic it was,</i>
<i>we can never repeat</i>
<i>this adventure</i>.
I agree.
<i># See the pyramids</i>
<i>along the Nile #</i>
<i># Watch the sun rise</i>
<i>from a tropic isle #</i>
<i># Just remember, darling,</i>
<i>all the while #</i>
<i># You belong to me #</i>
<i># See the market-place</i>
<i>in old Algiers #</i>
<i># Send me photographs</i>
<i>and souvenirs #</i>
<i># But remember</i>
<i>when a dream appears #</i>
<i># You belong to me #</i>
I think you should go with
something a little more orange.
Good night.
Mm-mmm. There goes
the neighbourhood.
Sir, thank you for speaking
to my son Amir.
He doesn't have
any friends,
and he's very lonely here
in Beverly Hills.
Perhaps
you could come over
for a Coke and backgammon
some time.
<i>Anytime</i>.
Thank you.
<i>Let's go</i>.
Hi, honey!
Oy, what a day.
Cop car smashed me
from behind.
Then the Iranian next door
just gave Jerry $500...
for talking to his son.
Aw, honey. You look so tired.
Can I fix you a drink?
You know, I know that's just
an afternoon shopping at
Neiman-Marcus to you,
but to some people
it's still a lot of money.
Let's see now.
Rum...
tonic water, and a slice
of lime, right?
Thank you.
Sorry I yelled.
I'm a little tense.
Oh, that's okay,
honey.
<i>Guess what</i>.
<i>The, uh, man from</i>
<i>the city of Beverly Hills</i>
<i>came in today</i>
<i>and he told me</i>
<i>that we have rats</i>...
great big ones, white ones,
Norwegian rats.
It's an epidemic.
Oh, honey.
Maybe they were just looking
for some herring.
- Barbara?
- What?
I thought we weren't
gonna drink anymore.
Well, Dave, yeah, it's true.
I am a vegetarian.
But I hear that vodka
comes from a potato.
Oh, honey.
Oh, I'm so crazy
about you.
Oh, let's go upstairs
right now
and make love like we've
never made love before.
<i>Ooh, my darling</i>.
<i>I missed you so much</i>.
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah!
- Barbara.
- Right now.
You're the best.
Come on.
<i>Carmen: Oh, I love that, Jerry!</i>
- Jerry!
- Dave.
- Get over here.
- Yeah?
Did you just diddle
Carmen?
- Yes, Dave, I did.
- Why?
She asked me to come in
and fix her TV.
Now, the male cable holder
had come off the cable,
so I put some tape
around the cable,
and I reinserted it in
the female receptacle.
That's when she climbed
all over me...
You are such a bastard!
Jerry, bring me a Tab,
please.
Get her the Tab!
Oh, yeah.
I don't want you diddling
my maid again.
<i>Then you</i>
<i>take her the Tab</i>.
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>you take her the Tab</i>.
- <i>You take it</i>.
- <i>No, come on,</i>
<i>don't be silly</i>.
<i>Will you grow up? Come on</i>.
<i>Oh, come on</i>.
Go on up! Go on up!
Good. Good. Good.
Hind leg.
<i>All right</i>.
<i>Ready? Great!</i>
<i>Oh, Matisse!</i>
Matisse just did
a half-gainer!
The Mexicans
are driving me crazy.
- There's gonna be
a strike in Tijuana.
- No.
Now the Chinese
are getting cold feet.
That could kill us.
I'm getting very nervous.
Are they still coming
for New Year's?
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>.
Good dog. Good boy.
That was great last night,
honey.
The dog is driving
me crazy, Jerry!
Are you sure
it isn't me, Dave?
I'm not sure
of anything anymore.
Well, I am. Hey, <i>amigo</i>.
I'm getting on your nerves.
I've worn out my welcome.
I'd just like to see you use
your talents, that's all.
My talent is survival,
Dave.
I could still make you
a manager of one of
my trailer parks.
Steady thing, you know?
It's near the ocean,
clean air. What do you say?
Hey, listen, Dave...
Here you go, <i>amigo</i>.
Uh, at those trailer parks,
people are always complaining...
their septic tank
is backed up,
their trailers
are off the blocks,
they're rolling down
the hills.
I couldn't deal with that
responsibility.
Well, I could put you on the
line at the hanger factory.
I think it's time for me
to go.
Ahh, you can stay!
Through the holidays.
You're the boss, Dave.
Hey, Jerry.
Oh, Max. Hi.
Hey, thanks.
For what?
Well, that was
quite a moment for me
when you saw me.
Well, you gotta be
what you're gonna be.
Oh, I'm not sure
what I'm gonna be.
Ah, well, you can't
hide forever, Max.
It's no big deal.
Well, my father.
I mean...
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What's your father
got to do with this?
Your father is tolerant.
Look at me.
Look what he did for me.
I send him tapes.
Besides, if I brought
my friends home and...
a- and my parents
saw them,
they would probably
freak out on me.
No. Wrong, Max. Wrong.
Your parents have been around.
I'd try talking to them.
- Talk to them?
- That's right.
You mean, just go
up there and say,
"Hello, mom and dad"...
No. Real.
Real. Yeah, real.
You mean, just go up there
and talk to them?
<i>That's right</i>.
Okay. Thanks.
Right.
I think you can go
with more orange, too.
Yeah.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh! This is absolutely
the last time
I'll ask for this, Jerry.
I swear.
Okay.
Oh, Mr. Whiteman.
I've got to tell you, something
is killing the azaleas
and your begonias
in the backyard.
It killed one hydrangea,
too.
At first I thought it was
the dog peeing on them,
but the damage
is too big for Matisse.
I don't want you to think
it's me or my boy.
Richard, Richard...
we both know who it is.
You know, Dave, you look like
you could use a vacation.
I got a condo in Hawaii...
Napili Kai on Maui.
You can use it any time.
You and your wife, beautiful
beach, golf, you name it.
Thanks.
Sidney, Pearl, now,
you have to concentrate!
It's all in the mind!
All right, now, let's go.
Go! Go!
- <i>Go!</i>
- Go! Go, Pearl! Go, Pearl!
Go! Go! Go!
All: Go!
All right!
You did it! You did it!
You did it!
All right, Barbara.
Barbara, over there!
Oh, I'm scared!
All right, now, come on,
Barbara.
I'm gonna wet my pants!
Come on, Barbara!
All: Go!
Go!
Go!
All: Go! Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!
Aah!
Go!
Dave! Dave!
What is... what did you do
to the lawn?
I don't have to do that!
Barbara, please!
Someone is pissing
on my hydrangeas!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Jerry's urged me to try
and communicate with you,
but too often
in our relationship
you have shown only anger.
<i>Jerry says "Anger will</i>
<i>get you nowhere. "</i>
<i>Here are some samples</i>
<i>of your anger</i>.
Get outta here, Max.
Get out of here, Max!
It's hangers that clothe you!
It's hangers that feed you!
You're giving me
a headache, Max!
Get out of here, Max!
- Max!
- Max! Max!
Get away! Get away!
Get away!
I'm on the phone!
I'm on the phone!
P. S.... I love you.
I don't understand.
Why doesn't he show us
the nice scenes?
I think he's trying
to reach out to us.
I think he's trying to say
something to us.
Trying to say something
to us?
Why doesn't he talk to
Dr. Toni Grant?
Oy, life! Oh, boy!
He likes Jerry
more than he likes me.
Oh, nonsense.
It's true. It's true.
Oh, honey, relax.
Relax.
You feeling sexy tonight?
No.
Ohh.
It might calm you down.
I have to figure out
what to do about Jerry.
Not tonight.
Tonight I'm gonna give you
an aura massage.
He's pissing
in the garden.
He's ruining
all the flowers.
He's cleaning out
all the refrigerators.
Well, he has helped
my headaches.
I offered him a job
the other day.
He said
it was too much trouble.
Too much trouble.
That's it. Ow! Ow! Ow!
You know, I-I've gotta
get him outta here.
Well, at least wait until
after the party, okay?
Why are you defending him
all of a sudden?
I really don't
understand this!
Honey, you've done a wonderful
thing for this man.
In the process,
you have taught me
a very important lesson.
I think he's diddling
Carmen.
That bastard has to go.
Barbara...
Barbara, the transplants!
Barbara! Barbara!
Oh! Oh, honey,
I'm sorry.
I got such a migraine.
<i>I thought your boyfriend was</i>
<i>coming home with you</i>.
What a wimp he turned
out to be, dad...
a total drug addict.
This is the Jim guy?
Yes.
Tell me
about this Jerry.
Mother says
he's very "gifted."
Ah, he's okay.
So, you want to stop
at the deli?
No.
You used to love that,
you know.
I used to walk you there
when you were 9 to get...
Dad, I know, but I was
9 years old.
- Give me a break.
- Okay, okay.
Jerry R. Baskin,
this is my daughter, Jen.
So, you're the one
that doesn't eat.
<i>You're a legend in</i>
<i>your own time, Mr. Baskin</i>.
<i>No, no, no, no</i>.
I'm just a bum.
You look more like
a millionaire to me.
You should see
the way he eats.
<i>Woman:</i>
...<i>loading and unloading</i>...
Can we have some music,
dad?
No, they stole
my Blaupunkt.
I apologised about
that radio, Dave.
I loaned him the car,
and my radio was stolen.
It wasn't my fault.
Then whose fault is it?!
Whose fault is it?!
I think I'll transfer
to Vassar, mom.
They have this really
great exchange programme.
I can go to Italy
in my junior year.
I think Europe
would be great for you.
So, um, what's with
this Jerry guy?
Oh, he's okay.
There's something about him
I don't trust at all.
Well, honey, he... he...
he has a strange wisdom.
Mom, is it
all right if I...
if I invite a couple
of friends to our party?
Sure, honey.
We could play some music.
I'm forming a band.
Do you know
any Chinese songs?
Well, how many of
the Chinese are coming?
10.
They travel in gangs.
Well, w-what are
we eating?
Uh, kosher, Chinese,
and Mexican.
Barbara, I invited Orvis
and his wife.
- That's okay, isn't it?
- That's great, honey.
You must have had a lot
to eat on the plane.
Do I remember
talking to you?
You look like you're
starving yourself.
Why don't you
keep your brilliant
insights to yourself?
<i>We don't</i>
<i>talk about it, Jerry</i>.
Oh, I see. I see.
W- W-Wait. It's better
to talk about it.
It's better to get things
out in the open.
Shut up, Max.
You know, you are a
troublemaker, mister.
Why don't you just
stay out of family
business, okay?
I'm getting damn sick
and tired of you, too, Jer.
Hey, Dave, I apologised
about the radio.
For Christ's sake,
look at your daughter!
- It's not
about the radio!
- Well, what...
Oh, to hell with it.
I'm outta here.
Jesus.
All: No!
Dave, this can wait!
Okay, okay, okay.
We'll talk about it
after the party.
You're the boss, Dave.
Give me
a piece of cake.
Thank you.
<i>There you are, Matisse</i>.
<i>Yeah</i>.
Man on TV: Materials.
The police inform that
no league group has put off
the responsibility
of these attacks.
Carmen?
I can't go on like this.
- Get out.
- Oh, this is killing me.
- You betrayed me.
- She's my wife.
- Ha! I knew
you would say that.
- What's the matter?
Come on, what's the matter?
Don't you like me?
Oh, that's not the point.
And now I see the big picture.
- What big picture?
- You are the imperialist...
using me
like the Third Worid.
What?
Oh, struggle is a great teacher.
You see, I am nothing.
I am the worker.
You are the capitalist.
The only way we change this
is revolution.
Wai... no, no, no.
We were having fun.
Yes... decadent fun.
Where are you
getting all this crap
on the walls?
What did you do?
Did you join a communist
discussion group?
My father was
a communist, okay?
Oh, then you're a traitor
to your class.
Where are you getting
all this stuff?
- Books.
- Books? What books?
The books that Jerry gave
to me.
Jerry?
Jerry.
Mm-hmm.
Jerry.
Jerry, Jerry, Jerry,
Jerry, Jerry.
Jerry. Jerry.
Debussy?
Yeah.
You play very well.
I play fair.
It's hard to find pianos
in alleys, you know.
Just another one of
your hidden talents, huh?
Yeah.
When I played
the concert circuit,
I always opened
with Debussy.
I want you to know
that I'm on to you, Jerry.
You're very attractive
in a sick way.
You're charming, iconoclastic.
You're a sociopath.
See, I'm a psych major,
you see,
so I know all about people
like you.
Now, my parents,
on the other hand,
they are kind, compassionate,
totally naive people,
and you are taking
advantage of their
kindness and naiveté.
That's disgusting,
it's immoral, and
I won't tolerate it, okay?
Do you understand me,
Jerry?
Now, you can find
a way to leave quietly
and gracefully
or I'm just gonna have
to find...
I'm just gonna have to find
another way to deal with you.
The game is over, Jerry,
as of tonight.
Hi!
- <i>Sheila: Oh, it's beautiful!</i>
- <i>Lou: I love it! Great touch!</i>
Barbara, Barbara,
there's Minister Chan.
Come on, Barbara.
There's Minister Chan.
Relax.
That's the caterer.
I hope he brought enough
abalone delight.
Oh, oh, oh,
look who's here.
Orvis! Hey, hey!
Thank you so much for coming.
- Hey, nice to see you.
- Oh, my wife, Sandra.
Sandra, a pleasure, pleasure.
This is my wife, Barbara.
These are our friends
Dr. And Mrs. Waltzberg.
Hello. How are you?
Would you like something
to eat? Either of you
like something to eat?
Please, come with me.
We'll get you something
to eat right now.
Introduce you to
some of our friends.
How are you?
This is Sidney Waxman
and his wife, Pearl...
my business manager.
<i>Barbara:</i>
<i>And these are my in-laws</i>.
- Sadie and Mel Whiteman.
- <i>Nice meeting you</i>.
This is my decorator,
Geraldo.
- Hello.
- <i>Mucho gusto</i>.
- <i>My yoga instructor,</i>
<i>Baba Ranbir</i>.
- Nice meeting you.
- <i>My dog's psychiatrist</i>...
- Pleasure to meet you.
Dr. Von Zimmer.
Oh, nice meeting you,
doctor.
Is that his wife?
She's a white girl.
They don't have
any white meat.
Not white meat...
white <i>wife</i>.
Dave, the Chinese.
The Chinese, the Chinese.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
I'm terribly sorry.
I should've been here
to greet you.
I'm Dave Whiteman.
I'm your host.
Welcome to my home,
Minister Chan.
So good to see you.
Minister Dong...
and all the other ministers
a- a-and managers.
Is it all right
if we "hang around"?
Minister Chan said, "Is it
all right if we 'hang around'?"
Business joke... get it?
Hangers.
That's very...
that's very funny.
This is my wife, Barbara.
How do you do?
Most beautiful flower
in the garden.
Most beautiful flower
in the garden.
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.
Would the minister care
for some Shanghai plum wine?
Would you like
some Shanghai plum wine?
No. Tab with a slice
of lemon, please.
- <i>Translator: Tab with a slice</i>
<i>of lemon, please</i>.
- Tab?
- Tab?
- Good.
- I want that.
- Yes.
They all want Tab.
I don't have that much Tab.
Many Tabs.
That's very...
Oh, here is
my daughter, Jenny.
Nice to meet you,
Minister Chan.
Ho ho ho ho!
<i>Happy new year</i>.
Here you are.
Thank you, Santa.
<i>Jerry! Jerry, Jerry</i>.
Ho ho ho ho!
Please tell Minister Chan that
this man was eating garbage
just three short weeks ago.
Ho ho ho ho ho ho!
<i>Dave and Barbara: Tabs!</i>
Tabs all around.
Minister.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're so welcome.
Happy new year.
Are you having
a happy new year, Spider?
We've made a good start,
have we not, huh?
Things are so much better.
And next year
will even be better.
Okay, everybody.
Orvis Goodnight
is going to play for us,
and there's
going to be dancing
in the living room,
so come on, let's go.
What did she say?
- We're gonna dance.
- We're gonna dance.
Ohh.

Blow it out your arse.
I don't want to talk

- Blow it out your arse.
- Be, oh, be a human being!

Hi, dad.
<i>I would like to introduce you</i>
<i>to some of my friends</i>.
This is Jill,
and this is Alexis,
and there's Moses,
and that's Jordan,
<i>and that's Crystal</i>.
<i>This is my band</i>.
Dad, I know
that you're shocked,
but don't say anything until
you've thought about it.
Until Jerry encouraged me
to face the truth,
I was in torment.
And I realise now
I- I just have to be myself.
I know
that you understand...
'cause I love you, dad.
I got lipstick on you.
Okay, we're gonna set up.
Bye.
<i># Whoo! #</i>
Daddy, listen, don't worry
about Max, okay?
This androgynous thing
that he's doing
is all a part
of growing up.
- Hmm.
- Really.
Teenagers are under a lot
of sexual pressure,
and this relieves it.
I promise you.
- Jenny.
- What?
Jenny, did I just see you
eat something?
I'm starving.
You're kidding!
That's fabulous!
What happened?
Daddy, I'm in love.
I am madly, passionately
in love.
- You're kidding.
- No.
This is great news.
Who is it?
See, nobody was
ever good enough for me
before, you know,
because I kept comparing
everybody to you.
- Oh, don't be silly.
- Really.
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, I was such a bitch.
I mean,
a total princess.
But once I let go
of my illusions
and my stupid
preconceptions...
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
Who is it? Who is it?
Tell me who it is.
Jerry.
Jerry... Jerry who?
Our Jerry, dad.
It's a miracle.
Did you and he, uh...
It's really a miracle.
Excuse me. One second.

it's the custom for people to

You bit my neck.
Wiseguy.
You tried to kill me.
I was provoked.
You shouldn't have saved me
in the first place.
<i>I lent you a hand,</i>
<i>and you bit it</i>.
I gave folks
what they wanted.
Really?
Yeah.
Linda Evans?
I never met the lady.
Hmph.
The sister
with leukaemia?
I never had a sister.
The ashram?
I drove by it once.
The books...
the political books?
I picked them up in
a supermarket.
What about us?
Oh, Jenny.
That's life.
You took advantage, Jer.
You lied.
Well, what'd you want
to hear, Dave...
real heartbreak,
real sorrow?
It's boring.
Here's your pants.
That's my underwear, too,
buddy.
<i>Yeah</i>.
<i>Oh, right you are</i>.
<i>That's right</i>.
<i>Oh, here's the money</i>
<i>the Iranian guy gave me</i>
<i>for his kid</i>
<i>when I gave him an apple</i>.
Keep it.
You gave him the apple.
<i>It was your apple</i>.
<i>Here's your clothes</i>.
<i>And you can keep</i>
<i>your hanger factories,</i>
<i>and you can keep</i>
<i>your credit cards</i>
<i>and everything else</i>.
It's called commitment,
<i>amigo</i>.
I don't need it.
Yeah, I know, I know.
You're free, huh?
You're free to eat garbage.
Yup. And I can piss
anywhere I want to.
You could've pissed
right here, Jerry.
Dave, he <i>did</i>.
He pissed all over the joint.
Where you goin'?
I'm real curious.
Who knows?
Carmen: Stay. I'll make you
a nice cappuccino.
Now go on back, Matisse!
No. No, Jerry.
You take him.
You're the only one
he listens to anyway.
Departure scene, take one.
I'll never eat again.
Come on, Matisse!
It's our lucky day,
<i>amigo</i>.
There's lots of places
we can go...
Frisco, Santa Fe,
Ensenada.
- Jerry's gonna show you
the ropes.
I'll show you the best parks
to sleep in,
beaches where the coconuts flop

What's the matter?
Come on.
This is good stuff.
This is the best garbage
