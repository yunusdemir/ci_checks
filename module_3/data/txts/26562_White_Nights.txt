EPISODE 2
<i>For just one hour,</i>
<i>I want you to be me, Se-jin.</i>
<i>Ask yourself, Se-jin.</i>
Even if it's very brief,
<i>even if it's a lie,</i>
<i>do you want to be like me?</i>
Are you Miss...
Yes.
I am Yi-kyung Seo.
MONEY, POWER
COLLUSION BETWEEN POLITICIANS
AND CORPORATIONS
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY
Where's her bodyguard?
She came alone.
Go get it.
Isn't there an interpreter?
I heard there would be someone
who speaks Korean.
Interpreter. An Interpreter.
Translator. Interpreter.
Interpreter...
What are you doing?
Where are the paintings?
Are you really here to sell paintings?
<i>Okay.</i>
They've got her.
The Feng Brothers are taking her
to the factory now.
She was too desperate
to think to look around.
Thanks to that, we'll have a smooth
general meeting without an unwanted guest.
FUTURE PROGRESS
ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATIONS
<i>Next topic for discussion is regarding</i>
sponsoring the East Asian Economy Forum--
Wait.
The matter of inducting a new member
was omitted.
What happened with that?
Isn't CEO of Gallery S
supposed to attend today's meeting?
Well,
that is...
the association's management committee,
during the review,
discovered that Gallery S
has a critical flaw.
And what is that?
I'd like to hear in front of everyone
what flaw my company and I have.
Ms. Seo. Why don't you
take your seat first?
Let's continue with the agenda.
But before that,
I'd like to say a few words.
Would you let me?
Yes, go ahead.
I learned of a shocking truth
a few days ago.
It is shameful. Something that personally,
I'd like to hide.
The fact is,
my son Gi-tae Son,
the association's financial director,
has been embezzling and misappropriating
the association's funds.
Father.
As a father, I wish I could
cover his wrongdoings,
but I decided all corruption
must be uncovered.
FUTURE PROGRESS
ASSOCIATION OF CORPORATIONS
Chunha Financing
will reimburse the association
for the loss it incurred.
Please punish my son harshly
for the wrong he committed.
Father, how could you do this?
Shut up!
Drag him out of here.
Father.
You can't... Let go!
Have you lost your mind?
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?
Father!
Okay, then.
The association will investigate
Gi-tae Son's corruption thoroughly
on our part.
By the way, Mr. Son,
we respect how you made
such a difficult decision.
Don't you agree?
People like us
who look at the big picture
when running businesses
must not forget
to be impartial and follow the rules.
I'm sure Chairman Bong-soo Seo,
whom I respect,
would have decided
the matter of his daughter's Korean
business in the same impartial manner.
I heard you went to Japan.
Did you get your father's consent?
Ms. Seo.
We are all very busy people.
If you have his consent, submit it.
If not, please leave.
What a shame.
Mr. Jo.
Ms. Seo has the original.
This is a copy.
My father
Chairman Bong-soo Seo
of Ilhan Finance wrote this by hand
and signed it at the bottom.
<i>I, Bong-soo Seo</i>
<i>permit Gallery S to operate in Korea.</i>
<i>Thus, I ask for your wholehearted support</i>
<i>and cooperation</i>
<i>and pray for the continued progress</i>
<i>of Future Progress,
Association of Corporations.</i>
Take it.
You don't need to do this.
I didn't write this
to pave the way for your business.
This is my will and testament.
I said I'd disown you,
but you insisted on going to Korea
and started this.
Whether you succeed or fail there,
you and I...
will never see each other again.
I will succeed.
I will win,
because that is how you raised me.
I did not.
I raised my successor.
I never created a monster.
Do you...
fear me?
It must be one or the other.
Either you grew weak
or I grew strong.
Don't grow any weaker.
<i>You need to see</i>
<i>the kingdom I will create.</i>
The break is lasting too long.
You planned this all along.
You pretended you didn't have
his consent and fooled me.
You made me kick out my own son!
That was your choice.
Impartial and by the rules.
It was touching.
Let's continue with the general meeting.
I'd like you to finish
my induction matter.
Your double who went to the hotel
is in my custody.
Tell everyone
the letter was forged
and that Mr. Seo did not approve.
Then I will let her go.
You shouldn't go all-in with a poor hand.
You'd better fold.
You don't care what happens to her?
I sent her knowing it was a trap.
She played her part,
so it's up to her to figure out the rest.
What I care about is the conclusion
of this general meeting.
You said everyone was busy.
We should continue with the meeting.
Where's Tak?
He's been following since the hotel.
Should I tell him to move?
Okay. I've been waiting.
Pull over!
Damn it.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
-I look forward to it.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
We're increasing the radius by 5km
from where he lost the car.
I'm checking to see if Chunha Financing
has any houses or factories
within the area.
Tak, stand by there.
Be ready to move as soon as
Ms. Kim locates her.
I thought you were the god of computers.
What's taking you so long?
Hack a satellite or something.
You're the one who lost her.
Who are you complaining to?
Hey. I thought you have
a black belt in every martial art.
They had a gun. A gun!
<i>Silence.</i>
We don't have time, so hurry.
Don't worry too much.
With Ms. Kim's skills,
we'll find her in no time.
Get cash together. In US dollars.
Dollars?
They're professionals who follow money.
If I pay them enough,
no one will get hurt.
How much should I prepare?
I don't know.
I wonder.
Se-jin Lee.
How much...
is she worth?
You guys...
made a mistake.
You brought the wrong person.
I'm not Yi-kyung Seo.
I went there in her place, that's all.
Shit.
I'm not Yi-kyung Seo.
You've mistaken, okay?
Let me go, okay?
After just one call.
You'll either go home
or go to hell.
Hello?
He's angry. He said we messed up.
He says it isn't her.
He said he'd only pay us half,
but in exchange for killing her.
Maybe he's lying
because he doesn't want to pay up.
I don't know. What should we do?
Call her.
Your boss.
<i>Se-jin is on the line.</i>
<i>I'll connect you.</i>
<i>Ms. Seo, it's me.</i>
<i>These people aren't here
to sell paintings.</i>
I've been abducted.
These people think I'm you--
-Let me talk to them.
-What?
I'll talk to them myself.
Give them the phone.
-Hello?
-I'm the one you want, not her.
<i>I'll compensate you for the mistake.</i>
Let her go.
For how much?
Fine. That's a deal.
Except you come and get her yourself.
Send Tak the address.
Tell him not rush, and to stand by.
Ms. Seo. They have guns. Guns.
I have a weapon too.
This is pretty powerful.
Hey.
Will you kill her, too?
One of them must be real.
We'll kill them both
and get the money we were promised.
-You're awesome.
-Who cares about the deal?
It's your turn. Go.
I told you, you can't beat me.
You...
<i>For just one hour,</i>
<i>I want you to be me, Se-jin.</i>
These people think I'm you--
<i>-Let me talk to them.</i>
-What?
<i>I'll talk to them myself.
Give them the phone.</i>
I'm here.
<i>Don't rush. Stand by.</i>
I need to use the bathroom.
-Toilet. Toilet, please.
-Hey.
It looks like she needs to pee.
You take her.
Don't touch anything.
What happened?
I found a great move.
Liar. You cheated while I was away!
How dare you accuse me?
I was winning.
You cheated! What the hell is this?
You cheater.
Punk. Do you want to die?
Freeze!
If you move...
If you move, I'll shoot.
Have you ever shot a person before? Shoot.
That won't work. Shoot me first.
You cocky bitch, shoot if you can!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Get up now!
What a shame.
You liked that dress.
You knew it from the start, right?
You sent me
knowing what will happen.
So, how did it feel to be me?
You'll catch a cold.
Emotions are just like money.
Use it sparingly.
"I'm sorry for lying."
Don't you feel that at all?
Is that what you want?
I'll say it, if you want.
I feel like crap.
You deceived me
and I almost died.
And...
-And I--
-I know.
You're angry and feel wronged.
We were supposed to have saved you
midway through,
but we made a mistake. I admit it.
You admit it?
A mistake?
I'll admit it too.
It was my mistake
for wanting to be like you...
even for a moment.
What a shame.
You have a lot of potential.
Ms. Seo.
What happened?
I don't know.
There was an explosion.
-An explosion?
-I did it.
-What do you mean?
-I couldn't sit there and just die.
Not while being someone's double.
Can you drive?
It's just a scratch.
Take her home.
I don't think she wants to go in my car.
Come to me when you've calmed down.
We still need to talk.
You're pretty gutsy.
Most girls
would've just cried and cried.
You are not any better than her.
You knew it was dangerous but played dumb.
Hey, what happened was...
It's okay.
How do you work for someone like her?
She lies to people and uses them.
But she doesn't even feel bad about it.
That witch.
That witch also tried to save you.
She was bringing money to trade for you.
They told her to come herself, so she did.
It isn't like her.
Are you all right?
I thought something had happened.
I was terrified.
You should rest.
You should go rest.
-Call Chunha Financing.
-Now?
He's a well-respected chairman
in the industry.
He shouldn't have his name associated
with abductions and whatnot.
Tell him to clean things up quietly.
Yes, ma'am.
Get me Se-jin's profile.
Make it as detailed as possible.
Why do you want...
Mr. Jo.
I'm very tired.
I'll let you rest.
<i>"I'm sorry for lying."</i>
<i>Don't you feel that at all?</i>
Emotions are just like money.
Use it sparingly.
<i>I did it.</i>
I couldn't sit there and just die.
Not while being someone's double.
Huh?
Ms. Seo.
Huh?
When did you go out?
You worked out already?
You should've slept in on a day like this.
I have a busy day.
It's more attractive
if a person is slightly lazy.
Is Mr. Jo here?
Let's have a meeting in 30 minutes.
Goodness.
How much money were you making
that you were out all night?
Just do what you can, and no more.
Don't bite off more than you can chew.
You might get hurt.
Yeah, you're right.
I shouldn't bite off too much.
Did something happen last night?
Like what?
Maybe it's because I had a bad dream.
I'm tired.
I'm looking for a way to get money,
so don't worry about the rent.
Our family won't end up on the street.
Don't you overdo it.
What if you slip in the bathhouse
like last year?
Don't jinx me.
I made some fish. Eat before you go.
Yes. Fish.
Goodness.
-Be careful.
-Okay.
Young-hae 200,000 won
Da-young 400,000 won
<i>I'm looking for a way to get money,
so don't worry about the rent.</i>
Hello.
He's waiting for you.
<i>Hey, newbie.</i>
<i>The customers are complaining,</i>
<i>asking if someone died in your family.</i>
<i>Smile. Smile.</i>
I'm sorry.
WOMEN-ONLY DESIGNATED DRIVER SERVICE
-I've got a call.
-You got a call?
-I'll be back later.
-Drive safely.
I'm jealous.
-Eat some of this.
-When will we get called?
-I know.
-Right?
Be careful.
-Did you get called?
-Don't get annoyed.
How was the painting, Chairman?
It's here.
-I'm up.
-You got a call?
What took you so long?
-I'm sorry.
-Get up. Hurry.
Get up. Gosh.
<i>She works at a parking lot during the day</i>
<i>and is a designated driver at night.</i>
FAMILY REGISTRATION CERTIFICATE
She works every minute
except when she sleeps.
Why is she doing this to herself
when there's a perfectly fine shortcut?
Let's see how long she lasts.
Gosh.
Excuse me. You have a guest.
I wanted to return this.
It's your dress.
I have no reason to accept it.
When I think about the giver,
the dress seems just as ugly.
It's too expensive to throw away.
Return it or exchange it.
Do whatever you want.
Do you like herbal tea?
Ms. Kim's herbal tea is top-notch.
I grow the herbs myself.
The key is to dry it well--
No thank you.
I need to get to work soon.
Then just make one, please.
What is this?
A contract.
I want to hire you to work for my company.
EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
You are just beyond words.
After what you made me go through...
This isn't amusing.
I don't hire people for amusement.
I'm offering because I need you.
There's an envelope there too.
CASHIER'S CHECK
I was going to use it to buy your safety,
but you got out on your own.
Consider it a signing bonus.
The amount is tempting,
but it doesn't feel so great.
I reject your offer.
What about your rent?
You need to send your cousin
to college, too.
You should do that much for your aunt
who raised you, don't you think?
Did you run a background check on me?
I need to know with whom I'll be working.
Se-jin.
I'm giving you an opportunity.
An opportunity to live your own life,
rather than being a double.
You're always like this.
You think money solves all,
and make fools of people.
What can't money accomplish?
I really don't know.
Shouldn't you at least
apologize for what happened?
You can't make up for it
with this stupid money.
"This stupid money"?
Don't look down on money.
Then money will look down on you.
Do you think fake smiles
and phony conversations
are worth even as much as a coin?
How much I want
and how much the other person can give.
All that matters are transactions
with defined values.
I was always terrible in math.
I will
just accept my fate and live poor.
She still won't apologize.
<i>I know she's smart,</i>
but you have many matters on your plate.
How many do you think have it?
Pardon?
The ability
to save herself and escape
from a deadly situation.
That instinct is not something
everyone has.
Once our plan gets under way,
we'll need to open many locked gates.
I plan to shape her into a universal key.
We'll see her again soon, so don't worry.
Once you ignite greed,
that fire
doesn't go out easily.
<i>What did you say? Shut it down?</i>
Are you saying you'll close
the business in Dubai?
Tell me, you punk!
You're not built for bread and water.
Come out and eat a balanced meal.
Who said I'd go out?
I said I won't give in.
-I--
-You went to the infirmary last night.
I heard you coughed all night long.
Let whoever wants Dubai
have Dubai and wherever else.
The head of the group is about to go
to prison. Who cares about a project?
You punk!
Fire me.
But you need to get out of here
if you want to fire me.
I'll make that happen.
-Move.
-Mr. Park
is in an important meeting.
What meeting?
With conspirators to ruin Dubai?
-I said to move!
-You are not on the list of participants.
I am the list.
You...
Let's take a ten-minute break.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.
Sure.
My dad already ripped me a new one.
Have pity on your nephew
and don't scold me too much.
If you shut down the business in Dubai,
it'll be fatal to the group.
It isn't something you can decide
on your own.
I've heard that for two hours already.
But it's the better option
than the chairman being jailed.
Shut it.
Do you think
this will make your father happy?
Forget causing the group a loss,
you're being a bad son.
Uncle.
I'm the son.
I am my father's son.
I'll play the role of the bad son,
so you should keep the chairman's chair
nice and warm.
Father needs to sit there once he returns.
Neither your father
nor you
will sit in that chair.
I'm not interested.
But it isn't your seat either.
<i>Hey. What are you doing? Cars are coming.</i>
I think she saw you.
I'm sure.
Did you insist on this hotel
for the meeting
because of Se-jin?
Come in, Ms. Seo.
I heard you and Chunha's Mr. Son
put on quite a show.
I heard you got rid of Gi-tae, too.
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.
That old man is just way too greedy.
But,
does Mr. Son still not know
that you are one of my people?
Ms. Seo will take care of Mr. Son
and the association matters.
We asked to see you because we heard
a different rumor.
A rumor?
Is Moojin backing out of Dubai?
Don't worry about that.
My nephew is being stupid
and doing that to get his father out.
He doesn't know it's just a waste of time.
If I close my fist,
he will crumble.
He's the chairman's only son.
He won't be an easy foe.
How will you get rid of him?
There's no need for you to know that.
I wondered if I could help.
You should be the head soon.
That's silly.
It will end up that way anyway, though.
An advance?
Do you think you are in a brothel?
But you said during the interview
that you can get me a few months' pay
in advance.
It's against the company rules
to give an advance to new hires,
but I can personally lend you the money.
Sorry?
How much do you need?
Think of me as a cousin and tell me. Okay?
Why you...
You creepy bastard.
-Hey, do you think you are in a brothel?
-Don't you want to work?
Forget it. I quit!
Hey! Gosh!
We meet again.
Didn't you come, knowing I work here?
I have something to say. Give me five...
no, three minutes.
Mr. Jo, wait for me in the car.
Yes, ma'am.
Will you make it brief? My day is packed.
Let me borrow that signing bonus
that you offered me.
I'll pay you back with interest.
We can write up loan agreement too.
I have the right to ask this much.
I almost died because of you.
Of course,
you have the right to ask.
But when you ask for something,
you should be prepared for rejection.
What I need is a useful employee,
not a borrower without collateral.
If you want to borrow money,
look elsewhere.
Things are a lot worse than expected
in Moojin Group.
If a fight breaks out,
both sides will be fatally injured.
Is that what you were thinking about?
I thought you were worrying about Se-jin.
I said there's nothing to worry about.
She won't last long.
-Did you call a designated driver?
-What took you so long?
Well, where to?
The GPS system has
a home button. Use that.
We're leaving now.
Where are we going?
Where are my friends?
Where did they go?
Those brats.
Did they leave me?
They can't get far.
Hey, let's go to Hongdae.
You know T-Rex, right?
Let's go to T-Rex!
Don't you know T-Rex?
It's the hottest...
Wait, you!
You are not going anywhere this time.
That loser, Hong-suk, told me everything
about how he paid you.
Hey. Sit down.
You are going to get us killed.
Don't lecture me.
You're just a designated driver.
No matter how many counterfeits you put on
to act like you are something,
You will forever be nothing.
Don't you get it?
You are nothing!
Shit.
Hey, Counterfeit! Where are you going?
Let go.
Gosh.
Hey!
Are you okay?
I'm sorry. Are you hurt?
I'm sorry.
Daddy...
Why are you dragging this out?
-I'm sorry.
-Come on.
Let's finish it already.
Yes, sir. I'll handle it.
Let's finish up and go.
I'm sorry.
A bruise on the face
and a fracture in the wrist.
Assault and battery are such headaches.
I didn't assault her.
I pushed her away lightly
and she fell on her own--
If they can send a lawyer
in the middle of the night,
her family must be pretty well-off.
You'll be at a disadvantage
if you take it to court.
Then what should I do?
Settle with the victim out of court.
You have to resolve it somehow.
It'll cost a pretty penny, too.
Shit.
Hi, Auntie.
<i>Why are you calling
instead of coming home?</i>
It's a good day for business.
The clients keep coming.
Then are you coming home in the morning?
Yeah.
I'll sleep at a sauna
and go straight to work.
Okay, then.
<i>Hey, Auntie.</i>
What?
Nothing.
Sorry for waking you.
That's right.
Song-mi came in second in her school
on her mock exam.
<i>She's holding her nose up so high.</i>
<i>She's utterly unbearable.</i>
Really?
I'd better buy her some pizza.
-Drive safely.
-Okay.
Sorry for waking you.
Things got a bit complicated.
Good for you.
The dad gets fired
and the daughter breaks her wrist.
What a lucky streak
-our family is having.
-Dad!
Who is she?
The one who did this to me.
What?
Stay out of it.
Why are you here?
To break my ankle this time?
Here.
I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
-I apologize.
-Apologize?
That's it?
It was all my fault.
Please forgive me.
And
I don't have money to offer
for settlement.
Hey, Counterfeit.
You can work your ass off
for every day in a year,
but it won't add up
to my monthly allowance.
Do you think I'd be cheap
and try to get money from you?
Thanks.
Then...
Kneel.
Get on your knees
and beg for forgiveness
for being rude to me at the auction
and up to what you did yesterday.
Then I'll forgive you.
What?
Does it hurt your pride?
Then get lost.
Dad, call the lawyer.
I want to have her locked up.
Hey. Why don't you just kneel?
I
was
wrong...
Get up.
You're pissing me off. Get up.
She's my employee.
It looks like a minor argument.
Why don't we end it here?
Can't you see this?
That witch hurt me.
Hey, Yi-kyung.
Can't you see what's going on here?
You have a terrible memory.
She almost died in my place
because of what you and your father did.
I'm trying very hard right now
not to expose you people
as the despicable beings that you are.
So don't
mess with her again.
If you were going to be arrogant,
you should've stayed that way.
If your pride lets you kneel
in front of bastards like them,
feed it to the dogs.
Do you think I wanted to kneel?
I'm angry too. More than you know.
What did I do wrong?
All I did was work hard to survive.
Why must I be disrespected
by scumbags like that?
Is being poor a sin?
Is it my fault I was born poor?
Of course.
Being poor is a sin.
You can package it how you want.
You're the only one who will be fooled.
The world will not.
You get stepped on because you're weak
and have nothing.
You're just like them.
I have nothing
and nowhere to lean,
so you thought you could control me
however you wanted.
That's why you chose me. Am I wrong?
You're right.
Right now, you're a cheap mirror
worth 5,000 won.
But if I set my mind to it,
I can raise your value
to five million, fifty million won
or even more.
You have nothing, so I'll fill you up.
If you need a place to lean,
I'll support you.
I'll shape you from head to toe
and use you thoroughly.
Did you...
Did you choose me from the beginning?
From the day we met at the auction?
I told you.
I never forget something
that I once wanted.
What is it?
Do you know me?
I know that dress,
since it's Gyung-ja Park's piece.
You must've confused it
for a similar dress.
No.
I never forget something I once wanted,
whether it be clothes or people.
Ms. Seo.
Can you really make me...
like you?
<i>I thought you wanted to be like me.</i>
<i>If your ambition is real,
do not be afraid of money.</i>
I'll buy this.
<i>Soon, there will be a meeting
of affiliate presidents of Moojin group.</i>
<i>Gun-woo is a thorn in my side.</i>
<i>I'll find a way to get rid of him.</i>
Do you even know what the association's
financial director really does?
Taking care of things
for someone very powerful.
<i>That someone should be needing my service.</i>
<i>If that leaks out,
you won't survive either!</i>
I'm almost done.
