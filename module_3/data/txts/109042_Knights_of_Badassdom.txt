(narrator)
In the 16th Century,
the mystic John Dee wrote
the "Sigillum Aemeth",
a book of musical chants
that were meant to
summon angels,
but brought
forth demons instead.
Fearing the unholy power of his
dark songs, Dee tried to destroy
the book, but
failed.
Sought by sorcerers and
dark rules for centuries,
the book had
been lost
...until now.
(Men chant in Latin)
(man)
Bequeath protection upon
thine followers who walketh
in the footsteps of--
And your appeasement
of the gods of --
Have failed.
(man)
What seven blood packs
not enough, Ronny?
(man)
Yeah, this shit's never coming
out of my tunic, by the way.
(Ronny)
I don't know what to
tell you guys, okay?
The appeasement fails?
(Eric)
It's bullshit.
You failed, Eric.
Okay?
Maybe if you made
a meaningful sacrifice.
Hey, that's
bullshit, Ronny.
(Eric)
We're over here in the woods
in the middle of the night.
We nailed the chant.
Come on.
Had everything that
game plan laid out.
Can't keep just failing
my appeasements forever.
(Ronny)
I'm sorry.
(Eric)
F you, Hung.
(Ronny)
The appeasement fails because
Eric wasn't meaning it.
He wasn't
being meaningful.
(man)
Bullshit, Ronny.
(Ronny)
I don't know what
to tell you guys.
(Eric)
Sometimes I don't know who's
harder to appease, Ronny.
(Ronny)
If you don't stop complaining,
the gods of --
are going to curse
all your characters
with a case of evil herpes!
Eric, you failed.
Maybe if you made
a meaningful sacrifice.
Guys, how will we ever taste
triumph at Evermore with this
weak bullshit?
Fear not, Sir Reginald, for
I have just the magic needed.
Excuse me while I whipeth
this out.
What was that?
Hey, Dude,
what's that?
What?
Oh shit!
Oh!
Eat paint, -- fuckers!
(Indistinct shout)
(man)
This'll teach you
to play your
fucking wizard
game in our woods.
Run!
Run, you freaks.
Don't ever
come back.
Hey, check
this shit out.
Harry Pooper dropped
his book.
Yeah, tear
that shit.
Come on, man.
Destroy the book.
Rip it
open.
What the fuck?
(Muffled screaming)
Fuck.
Jesus motherfucker.
The book fucked
up your face.
Ahh!
(man)
Be strong,
Sir Reginald.
Be strong, I say.
Oh man.
Fuck.
Shit!
We gotta go back
for the book.
(man)
What book?
I brought that kickass old book
I was gonna use for my spells!
Fuck!
I must have dropped it when
those people attacked us!
Shit!
Fuck!
(man)
Is this it?
That's it.
Whoo.
Thank God.
Sorry about
freaking out.
No problem.
Ronny Kwok, he's gonna
shit when he sees that.
We'll be back,
you redneck cocksuckers.

Mm-hmm.
I wrote it as

Listen, if that song

I don't

We need to have a talk.
I am way

How about you,

Somewhere with

Oh, no, no,

Whoa.
It's cool.
It's

I mean, why mess with
a good thing, right?
Time out here, Joe.
You're breaking up with me.
Will you listen to me?
You have a college degree
in communications studies.
You could be doing anything
you wanted.
Hold up.
I am doing what I want.
You live in a fake castle

black metal in your bedroom.
You will

Uh, it's doom metal.
Who the fuck asked you?
Well, he's right.
Gilberto, you're

It was black.
Then we went through
a sludge phase.
Now it's more doom.
I need to focus on

It's important that

I'm sorry, but
that's just how it is.

You had a vision of her just
ripping out my heart, huh?
Yeah.
Thanks for the heads up,

I'm a 26-level

I know that you know that;
you're just trying to be
hurtful.
Fucking Beth.
Dude, look, I'm sorry for what
happened, but you two hadn't
been right for each

It's only the rejection
that hurts.
You'll get over that.
Maybe she's right.
Maybe... I should be
making some changes.
Maybe I should
move out of here.
No, there's no

You always have a place

I still love her.
We can't leave

I'll be fine.
Just go.

This is awkward.
I know what

Come on.
Come on!
I told you, I don't

Yeah and the reason you quit

Though there will be a big
surprise in store for all.
And as game master, I will be
watching over all of this.
You can think
of me as God.
Excuse me a minute.
Ah, Gwen.
Just whom
I wanted to see.
I have been watching you these
battle-swept nights of the
campaign and you
have shown your mettle.
So verily, the time
has come for

Oh God.
The game hasn't

We don't have to talk in

I thought maybe you'd want to be

Ow!
Ooh.
I have an idea of what

You okay?
Shut your mouth.
Onward.

Whoa.
Hey.

Come on, Joe.
You played D&D.

D&D was a long time ago.
Yeah.
And you were a legend.
These people here?
They sing songs about the time
that you gave Ronny Kwok's
paladin

Do you remember, remember when
we caught Ronny spanking it to
the succubus picture in
the old monster manual?
Good times, man.
Yeah, and some of us
are still having 'em.
Come on!
Eric's about to level up to

We need to get
out of here.
What we need to do is avenge the
poor souls taken here this eve.
With what?
Foam sticks?
Jobryeth
is right.
We need weapons from my
private reserve of steel.
Thou speakests

Let us return

And arm
ourselves.
While they call for

Very well.
I am

I have to

Where the fuck am I?

Why is there
no one here?
Shouldn't
someone be here?
Come on, the best way for us
to help is to drive somewhere
and get some.
That's not what
was agreed upon.
We were to seek vengeance.
Where are

Weapons are

Anyone?
Sweet Jesus,

Sorry, dude.
There's some weird shit

What are you guys up to?

Everyone else completed their

Are you guys gonna camp

No!

This has something to do with

at Prom.
(Eric)
What?
In the book,

What?
Get the fuck out, man.
No, I had the photo with me
when you summoned this...
whatever this
is with the book.
Eric, use the book to
send that bitch back wherever
she came from!
I don't know how?
I just picked a page
at random earlier.
Well then,
just pick another...
pick another page
and hurry the fuck up.

That was for Hung!
Take that, bitch!
That was--

What?
You just let
her get away.
Excuse me?
She just went off into the woods
to die like a wounded animal.
(Ronny)
Gimme the book.
Fuck!
God.
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
Where did you get this book?
Uh, why?
Shut up,
never mind.
Did you read
this page?
Um.
Why?
Did you read it?
Yes, yes!
Holy fuck, yes.
We read it and it scared that
crazy chick back to hell
or wherever the
fuck she came from.
If that doesn't get me to level
27, I don't know what will,
Kwok, so why
don't you pony up.
No, no,
no, no, no, okay.
That all makes sense.
(Joe)
It makes no sense.
It's gibberish--
It makes sense!
It makes sense that
you speak Enochian.
Enochian, what?
You made
that up.
This is the "Sigillum Aemeth."
It is the only one of its kind.
It was handwritten in the 16th
Century by the mystic John Dee
and it has been
lost for generations.
Uh, bullshit.
It came from the internets,
not the 16th Century.
If you're trying to get out
of admitting how awesome I am--
John Dee was trying to summon
angels, but evil travels under
its own power and he actually
summoned demons
and the demons
forged this book.
What are you
saying, Kwok?
Dee tried to destroy,
but he couldn't.
So he sealed it and he hid it
deep underneath his manor estate
and it has been lost
for generations.
But here it is in your
incapable hands and you summoned
a succubus from hell!
(gasping)
And then this lat passage
that you read,
the herald of Abominog.
And in the language lay the name
of the hell lord Abominog and
I hath spoken the name
and hell has raineth down.
(growling)
You didn't injure it,
you ignorant fuck!
You transformed it!
Sorry.
Transformed into
what exactly?
What?
What the fuck
was that?
I don't know.

Evermore is going to start

It's not supposed to happen
for another few hours,

There's a LARPer buffet on

bastards have is
foam sticks.
We have to save them.
Are you fucking
nuts?
No.
I think I've done
