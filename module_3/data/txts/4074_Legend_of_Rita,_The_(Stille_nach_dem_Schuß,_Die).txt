Hey people!
We are THE robbers.
Get your hands up!
- Don't try anything!
You know us
from the news!
With this, we stimulate
the economy!
This is an
expropriation proceeding!
Bag everything!
Ownership is theft!
Here you go!
Hands up again!
Down with
capitalism!
Stop them!
Come in, Granny!
There's a robbery in progress.
- Ah?
(Police siren)
Spare a buck?
Have a long life!
Good luck!
<i>(Rita:)
Those were the happy years.</i>
We thought we were the best,
Tatjana.
We tried to abolish injustice
as well as the government.
Both were connected.
Politics were war,
throughout the world.
She has a .32 Walther.
- How do you know all that?
Get down!
Please open
the bag!
I'm passing through in transit.
Open the bag!
Take a seat, please.
Your name is Marianne Berg.
- Yes.
But you are Rita Vogt.
No, Marianne Berg.
I know
you are Rita Vogt.
You aren't allowed to
enter the country carrying a weapon.
I'm on my way to West Berlin.
You can't pass through either
as long as you're armed.
My friends in Beirut
recommended Schönefeld.
Sometimes, different people
have the same friends.
In case you ever come back here,
take this phone number.
I can pass through then?
- As soon as I know.
Friends, too?
I'd just like to know.
My name's Erwin.
Great that you want to help us.
Riding horses, playing tennis or guzzling
down salmon doesn't interest me.
Here's your passport.
One has to hate the world's crudeness
in order to be able to appreciate
it's delicateness.
I only had a crush.
- On Andi?
Can you handle it?
She can hit trees,
but only wide ones.
Gruber defends him.
Isn't that the better solution?
No way.
He'd be in prison for 10 more years.
Gruber won't be
involved in anything.
I'm here to visit my
client, Mr. Klein.
My trainee,
Frau Adebach.
A police officer shoots at
someone who's fleeing.
Does he want to kill him,
or just thwart the getaway?
A fleeing guy
shoots at the police officer.
Does he want to kill him,
or just continue his getaway?
What do you think about that?
I'm glad you're trying.
Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like to ask something.
- Please, go ahead.
Last Christmas,
general amnesty was granted.
My brother got out then.
Now he's in again.
Will there be another amnesty
this Christmas?
I don't want to be rude,
but I don't think so.
But it's Christmas.
Andreas Klein.
My name is Gruber.
This is Miss Adebach.
We've got one hour.
Are you insane?
(Shot)
(Shot)
Open up please!
(Shots)
Venceremos!
Where's Friederike?
She didn't make it out.
- Step on it!
This coat is so fucking bright.
Why did you shoot?
- What happened?
Give me your jacket!
Why did you shoot?
Stop your yelling!
Nothing went wrong!
Where are we going?
- Across the border.
(Andi:)
Are you crazy?
(Announcement:)
Berlin, capital of the GDR.
Station Friedrichstraße.
Passengers from West Germany
Counters 1 through 5.
Red cops are
cops, too.
A comrade who's name
is just Erwin?!
That's probably not even his real name.
In Germany, aggression
has always come from the right wing.
But we are also against
terrorism from the left.
Terrorism doesn't lead anywhere.
Terrorism scares the public
and causes the deployment of defense mechanisms.
Even Lenin knew that already.
His brother was
executed a terrorist.
Sit down!
Thanks.
But I sympathize
with romantic young people.
We too are romantics.
I am seventy
and still dreaming.
Nothing's ever completed.
How can they break a guy out
of prison, in broad daylight.
Up to now, we've never known their plans.
But we are supposed to know everything!
You have to look at it that way.
- Yes, Comrade General.
What are you up to?
Trust has to be established through
common experiences.
I thought we were
barbecuing sausages.
I believe the plane is gone.
Maybe it's a trap?
- He's a fair guy.
(Someone tries to
open the door.)
Hello!
So we meet again this soon.
- I didn't see that coming, either.
Your weapons, please.
But we're just passing through!
- That's what I thought, too.
You still need to see a doctor.
I don't have a weapon.
He looked at me.
Everything was clear to him.
- Maybe he isn't hurt that bad.
Can I help?
- But you are our guests!
Does anyone want a "jester"? - I do.
This sausage tastes good.
- Thüringer rib steak sausage.
The beer is Radeberger.
- It's good as well.
A toast to my release from
the capitalist pigs' prison.
As a free man, on free ground!
Cheers!
I like this place.
But what are we doing here?
Exchange of thoughts.
Which thought would you like to exchange?
That the revolution marches on
diverging paths!
Here, she sits in the office
from 8 to 5.
You guys have such
a sense for violence.
Here, the government is the
organized form of violence.
You can only break laws,
we make them!
From the outside,
you only see the wall.
You see the wall from the inside, too.
Does the GDR have to extradite
criminals who are wanted in West Germany?
Questions of law
aren't my expertise.
But East and West Germany aren't exactly pals.
But nothing bad is allowed to happen here!
No actions on GDR territory!
- Noone wants that.
In return, you can pass through.
We independently fight
against imperialism.
But we have a common enemy.
- These are difficult subjects.
We frighten the right people.
(TV:)
The counselor died on the scene.
Dr. Gruber hadn't worked on
cases concerning terrorism before.
He leaves a wife
and two young kids.
The fugitive, Andreas Klein,
got a gun through
Gruber's trainee,
Friederike Adebach.
A large-scale manhunt has been initiated.
Apart from Andreas Klein,
the following persons are wanted:
Detlev Bergmann.
Joachim Klatte.
Hans Jürgen Dost.
Martina Lubitz.
Rita Vogt.
Rita Vogt can be recognised through a
scar on her elbow.
Caution:
These persons are armed.
The perpetrators are
likely to still be in West Berlin.
However, the search has been expanded
to cover the entire federal territory.
Did you HAVE to shoot?
The counselor grabbed me.
Why does he do something like that?
I can't hit a human being.
Then the cop came and shot.
So I shot.
The counsellor was in the way.
Shouldn't we bail
for a while, Andi?
Does imperialism go down by itself?
Does injustice vanish by itself?
I don't want to argue with you,
I want to be with you!
(Heavy breathing sounds
from the headphones.)
(He shuts off the device.)
Well...
Excuse me,
comrades.
(He knocks on the door.)
I'm cracking up,
they are screwing.
Here, in the East.
And what are WE doing?
We aren't screwing.
Nice girls.
Plus, they have steady employment.
You won't find something like that
over here.
I think
all vigour is gone, over here.
(Rita:) We tried to
accomplish the impossible,
at least once in our lives.
We felt like we were part
of the international fight.
And then we experienced
how in Beirut
a just cause lead to
a murderous civil war.
We wanted to bring the war
into the metropoles of the world.
<i>There were never ending discussions,</i>
successful and failed operations.
Victims on both sides.
A couple of years later,
we were in Paris.
And we were stuck.
(Friederike:)
I know how it's going to end.
We'll go to prison,
for ever.
We sit around
in these fat rich countries
and waste our lives.
And what for? For the poor,
somewhere on this world?
Why don't we go
to the starving?
The guilty are here.
The state is
carried by individuals.
We just say those people
should be liable to prosecution.
These are Andi's words.
Everything started with him.
It started with you. You didn't want to
ride horses,
play tennis and guzzle down salmon.
- And so forth.
Come here!
(Saxophone music)
If they get me, I fear
I could betray you.
Do you see those guys?
They shoot without warning.
You're going insane.
We shoot first.
(Anna:) Under the rule of imperialism,
an armed fight out of illegality
is the only chance
for active critical agitation.
Yea, man or pig.
We need money for our operations.
- A gun will take care of that.
You can block the grate
with two beer crates.
We've already done that a couple of time.
That way, you cannot get trapped inside.
Rita had a look around inside.
It's idiotic to rob a bank here.
- Why?
We used to say: Don't worry, this is an
anti-capitalistic operation.
How do you say it here?
- Friederike speaks French.
She shall say: We don't steal.
This is the German Revolution.
You can't assault people
with a gun all the time.
We do this together, like in the past.
- Count me out.
You have a
personal problem.
You degenerate to a private individual
and buy a Honda with OUR money.
You defect to the pigs!
You betray me.
You think so?
- Yes.
You're looking for an enemy.
But why me?!
Let Rita be.
You fuck around and wear
designer suits.
Dumb pig from the
ruling class!
Hey, that's unnecessarily
personal!
What are the two of you? Problem or
solution? Man or pig?
One thing is obvious:
Fight the pigs
to liberate man!
Every armed operation subdues
the force of the circumstances
to the force of the events.
That better be clear!
Vous roulez sans casques.
- We drive without a helmet.
Excusez-nous! - Vous n'êtes pas d'ici?
Montrez-moi vos papiers!
(Police siren)
Run!
(Police siren)
(She shoots.)
Early in the morning, the East is cold.
We've got everything.
Radeberger too.
Gladly. That's what we used
to have back then.
What's already good,
does not have to be changed.
Some comrades don't
want to continue.
We dismounted riders,
but not the emperor.
We're in deep shit.
Those comrades cost us money
and are unreliable.
I am reliable!
I don't want to sit around and wait.
We were to fight on the world front.
That's what you said.
And, where is the world front?
Somewhere on this world,
people like us have to be needed!
Vase.
Angola would be a destination.
Or Mozambique, if that's possible.
You do have connections to there,
don't you?
Like this, it already
looks a lot brighter.
We have to get out of
France, too.
I know.
To whom did that thing happen,
with the cop?
To me.
It happened to me.
You want to quit, too?
- No!
(The men scare up
some deer.)
Ten people.
They want to go anywhere, no matter where.
Preferably Angola
or Mozambique.
What do they want
from us?
We are supposed to get them
in and have them accommodated.
People are black there.
As whites, how do they plan on disappearing?
I'll leave that to you.
Let's get back to
the issue at hand.
We can't make any mistakes.
That's how I see it, comrade General.
That's how one has to see it.
We talk without any witnesses?
- And off the record.
Were can we sit down and talk?
- Inside.
Let's sit under the tree.
Good idea.
You are wanted world-wide,
even the ones who quit.
We wont send any one of you
to Africa,
not Angola, not Mozambique.
The political situation there is fragile.
Secret agents all over the place.
And the people are black.
You are white.
You can be traced back to us.
We propose a different offer.
Your people can stay here.
In the GDR.
Separated,
not in a group.
No contact between each other,
or to their former life.
Every single one has to sign on this.
They will get new names
and have new identities.
For a long time.
Maybe for ever.
Given that you lead an utterly
normal, common life.
The life of the working class,
so to speak.
And another thing.
We should have
more serious talks
than we've had in the past,
in regular intervals.
I doubt you tell us all about all of your plans.
You're merely supposed to listen to us,
before you scheme anything.
Do we get any
military support?
You can go in for sports here.
Is shooting considered sport?
You can see it like that.
The RPG-7 is an anti-armor
weapon. Who shoots?
Me.
20 metres safety clearance!
They know the ropes.
They have to have practiced already.
They couldn't make this dog into a fighter.
- What's it doing here?
It's a request of the department for personal security.
We have to do it.
We're driving important people,
too.
Is the dog supposed to be in
the car?
Every round has to be accounted for.
The department for personal security pays for it.
Fire!
(The dog whimpers.)
(Shot)
(They sing.)
"... the partisans of the Amur."
"That's how we blasted the scum to hell,
General and Ataman."
"Our campaign found it's end
only in the Pacific."
These songs were with us.
That's how we started over after the war.
They were always with us.
And rock 'n' roll?
Not so much.
Vodka is the soldier's friend.
Hey, Andi ...
You used to be my
ardent love once.
So?
Is this here the life
of the working class?
I'd rather drink my beer
somewhere else.
Good morning!
Four to Beirut.
For you, for you ...
and for you two.
You don't have to pay!
We want to.
One ticket is left over.
Rita!
I find it brave of you
to have stayed here.
You are going to see socialism
for what it is.
You are going to see that sometimes
we have to force people into their luck.
But maybe,
you will understand.
We are for the people,
therefore we are against them.
And my mother
didn't get along with herself.
She didn't have a lot of money.
At age 42, she suddenly died.
I don't understand it.
We now start with your story.
- What's my story?
Your made-up life,
which now becomes your real one.
When do you want to
have your birthday?
Summer time,
when it's warm.
Which name do you want?
Suggestion: Schmidt [Smith, very common name]
Schmidt is retarded.
Different proposal then?
No, Schmidt's fine.
Given name?
You choose.
We are going to make some suggestions
for your parents' data soon.
I don't need parents.
- We let them be dead then.
Otherwise, you'll be asked about
your parents all the time.
You don't have any anymore.
The truth makes for the best lies.
(Alarm goes off.)
You know you need to carry
your ID at all times.
But you know me.
That's not my job.
Which department?
- Fashion print.
Name? - Susanne Schmidt.
There's an error in the print.
- Yes, exactly.
(Woman:) The fabric print is defective!
- Coming.
Aw, shit!
Shit, man!
Something like this never happened
before you started here.
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.
- Just like we did with hiring you.
No wonder that
your hands are shaking!
We'll teach you! - Teach
Elfriede, so she bathes herself.
I don't use soap. Soap destroys the
natural protective layer of the skin.
One can smell that.
I don't care what an alcoholic
has to say about me, anyway.
It's always an argument with you guys!
Why are you so bitchy with Tatjana?
She's the bitch!
- And you are cows, stupid cows!
Done?
I love you all.
Have you never been married?
- Alas, no.
There was someone,
when my parents had the accident.
As you know, they had a fatal accident in the Netherlands.
- I didn't know that.
Don't you regret
coming here?
I've always been
left [politically].
I didn't have a lot of options.
I used to be a waitress.
Funny. You come here voluntarily,
and I want nothing more than to get away.
It is how it is.
Here and there.
I'd like to see that
with my own eyes.
Maybe I'd even come back.
Then I'd be here on my own will.
Here's the list
for Nicaragua.
Again already?
Do you have a pen?
Are you messing with us?
(German folk music.)
If you please...
If you please...
- Thanks.
What's going on today?
You don't dance?
- Neither do you.
Red wine, please.
Why did you donate
10 Marks?
I thought that wasn't
too much.
Do you really think
they get the money?
Don't you?
Dear colleagues!
Do you still have access to West Marks?
- Alas, no.
I spent the last on a
Trabant [cheap car].
You can get everything with West Marks.
- I didn't have much.
Why didn't you rob a bank?
Oh, I did.
Cheers!
I drink to that.
(People applauding.)
Günnel, Sigrid.
Janzen, Andrea.
And Blechschmidt, Klaus.
(People applaud.)
(Dance music.
People cheer.)
''Live is Live ... ''
Tatjana?
Tatjana!
(Very loud music.)
Tatjana!!
Where were you today?
- I overslept.
We were worried.
- I doubt that.
What's the time?
- Half past three.
(She turns off the music.)
Shit.
Do you want some coffee?
If you have some, too.
I can do that.
I feel sick.
(The water boils.)
Why's it boiling already?
The current goes directly into the water.
You can't stick a spoon in there.
Or you're dead.
You are insane,
using that!
My ex-husband built it for me.
- He wanted to kill you!
Thanks.
Don't use that thing anymore!
I'm invincible!
Hello!
- Hello.
My place?
I live around the corner.
Admit it, you didn't notice!
- Did you steal these?
I wanted to get
ourselves a little treat.
What else have you done?
- Danced in a bar.
Really?
First, I wound myself
around a pole.
Then I bent over, and everyone
could see into my ass.
And what do you expect here?
(TV:) In the past, when a sailing ship
got into a dead calm,
when no one brought up wind,
it were bad times.
Then you spent Easter
off the Christmas islands ...
Strange, out of big glasses
one can drink more without getting drunk.
(He sings:) What shall we do with the
drunken sailor early in the morning?
You can stay.
I'll sleep soon.
There was still some left in there.
It's empty.
You poured out the booze!
Don't lie about it!
Let me go!
Give me the key!
You think
I can't climb?
Tatjana!
Do you know how much one bottle of this is,
stupid western cow?
Step on the gas!
And now, shift into second gear!
(They giggle.)
Careful!
Stay on the road!
Clutch, take out the gear,
and now, break!
How am I?
- First class!
Turn around!
Drive down that path in reverse!
How do I do that?
Push down on it, move it downwards.
Accelerate, and steer.
Oh!
Fuck!
This is a new car!
Doesn't matter.
It's Sunday.
Lieutenant Knorz.
Who was driving?
Me. - Licence and
registration, please!
What have we done wrong?
We drove against a tree
in reverse.
Exactly.
And that's what you've done wrong.
Have you had any alcohol?
- No. - Me neither.
Follow me to the garage.
Please! - Thanks.
(Accordion music)
This is a friend from school.
They should've taken him.
You had bad luck with your marriage.
Do you know that?
She was too young.
And the husband wasn't mature either.
After the divorce, she
dyed her hair.
Your name is Susanne?
- Susanne Schmidt.
Pleased to meet you. Margarethe.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
Cheers people,
all the best!
(TV:) From Hamburg,
the news of the day.
Bloody incident at the
German-French border.
Two men died when they
tried to skip
border controls.
One of them is alleged
terrorist Andreas Klein.
His companion is
yet to be identified.
The following persons
are wanted:
Bernd Ruppel, Rita Vogt.
She has a scar on the left elbow.
Caution: Those people
don't hesitate to use their weapons.
Let's go dancing!
(Accordion music)
(Father:) I used to work in China,
as a mechanic. Not everyone gets that far.
Susanne has been to Paris!
She moved back here nonetheless,
since she likes it better.
You don't hear that often.
The concept is better:
Less poverty, less richness.
Many people died for it, all throughout the world.
I've seen the Great Wall.
They drove us there.
But, especially the people!
It's a misperception
that they all look the same.
My father always
talks about China.
Do you want some wine?
Home made.
My mother warned me
about men.
Women never came up.
I'll leave.
They have Bulgarian tomatoes!
- Look, the colour!
I'll get some for us.
- I'll make Ratatouille then.
What? - Ratatouille.
Do you have a scar on your arm?
- Why?
Later!
Ask her if she has a scar on her arm!
- It doesn't bother me.
How is it to live with
such a past?
A call to Berlin.
Step into the phone booth!
Someone recognised me.
Can I go back to my house anyhow?
She saw you on TV?
- I think so.
Did you see it, too? - Yes.
Where? - At a birthday party.
Who's birthday?
- My colleague's Father's.
So all saw it?
I was alone in the room.
I want to be entirely truthful.
- You should be.
Tatjana stood in the door.
But not from the start.
I don't know since when.
But she hasn't said anything yet.
You stay here for the time being.
I have to be at work for the first shift tomorrow.
- We'll take care of that.
I'll be missed elsewhere,
too.
You are good friends.
We know that.
She bought tomatoes
for supper.
She loses it, doesn't get it.
Rumors are spread.
Write a letter!
You'll be back in a couple of days.
We'll deliver it immediately.
When will I be back?
- Soon.
Dear Tatjana,
I'm in a big hurry.
I have to help a friend.
I'll be back soon!
<i>Don't think anything by it.
It is how it is.</i>
Sad story, the thing with Andi.
He didn't stand a chance.
You can't go back.
What do you mean?
- What I said.
Why did I have to
write the letter then?
Because we needed to
buy some time.
But I want to
go back to Tatjana.
And how's that supposed to work?
- That's my only condition.
You are making conditions?
Do you know what would happen
if your cover was blown?
The GDR signed international
anti-terrorism treaties.
Your credibility is at stake.
One can easily be crushed through something like that,
not only you.
Are you interested in the welfare
of human beings?
That's our job.
We usually deal with male comrades.
My husband was a lieutenant,
until he retired.
We always lived in the
suburbs.
Twenty - twelve.
Twenty-one - twelve.
Hold on. Rematch!
How did you carry these things?
- I'll show you.
You walk differently.
Your body has a centre.
Doesn't the skin get cold?
- The gun gets warm.
Are you insane?
Why isn't the safety engaged?
- It was! - No!
You've already shot someone
before!
I helped him with accounting.
He died age 32.
I didn't want to
be a widow.
(Someone knocks.)
Please, come in.
You aren't asleep yet.
- I'm practising my third life.
Sabine Walter.
Too young to live a widow's life.
This time, you're from the East.
That'll provoke less nosy questions.
Maybe you should ...
wear glasses.
You're pretty anyway.
A cat has seven lives.
Are you married?
Yes.
It's important to be married.
Visit your colleague one last time.
It won't hurt.
The story needs an ending.
Who's there?
- Susanne.
You look different.
- You too.
I knew you'd get in touch
as soon as possible.
I often checked to see
if your Trabbi [the car] was here.
I didn't want to
abandon you.
I think it's great that I know you.
You are important, compared to me.
I want to
say goodbye.
I'm going back
to West Germany.
Because of my family.
- But your parents are deceased.
I have siblings.
Don't use that hellish
device anymore!
What?
- That thing you use to make coffee.
People say
you are a wanted terrorist.
If that was true,
I couldn't go back to West Germany.
When they mentioned the scar,
I knew.
I'm your friend.
Talk to me!
You are mistaken, Tatjana.
I beg you,
believe me!
Are you going to write?
Of course!
Yes, of course.
Stop bullshitting!
Beat it!
I'll come with you.
Maybe I'll come back sometime.
I'll be gone then.
Can I sit in the back?
- Go ahead.
That was fast. What did she say?
- That she's my girlfriend.
This is the bathroom.
The kitchen.
A couple of lamps are missing.
We've unpacked everything.
Except for the books.
Call if there's any problem at all.
I want to join the [political] party.
You always need to be truthful with
the party.
Can you do that?
Good morning!
This is where you're going to be working.
Mrs. Walter is going to
prepare the children's summer vacation.
She used to work in her late husband's
handicraft shop. - Yes.
Coffee? - No, thank you.
Your new colleagues will
show you around.
(Stuff collapses.)
Are those old ones?
- Yes.
I'm Christa. These are Beate
and Monika. We address each other informally.
I'm Sabine.
I'm sorry, I can't help.
Good morning!
I've written down
who we need:
FDGB [trade union], BGL [company trade union committee],
FDJ [official youth organisation], the mayor,
the Hygiene, the youth's welfare,
railroad, DRK [German Red Cross],
ÖV [public administration], company canteen,
construction management -
- and the children's commission.
To come off best, all at one table!
Can you swim?
Don't go out that far!
Silke, not so far out!
Are you keeping an
eye on the children?
Yes.
Then I am going to
keep an eye on you from now on.
My name is
Jochen Pettka.
(The children sing:)
Sleep, child, sleep,
mother shepherds the sheep,
father shakes the tree,
falls down a dream,
sleep, child, sleep!
Good night!
- Good night, Sabine!
What are you reading? - "The Physics
of the Next Millennium".
Here's a nice sentence:
Innovation is what you cannot see.
Seeing something new from time
to time is what's beautiful in life.
Does that mean things never play
out as you would expect them to? - Yes.
Thank God not always.
This is my third summer here,
as a lifeguard.
You've already been here a couple of times?
- Yes, one gets to know a lot of people.
You have beautiful eyes
behind your glasses.
You went straight in there!
You think so?
Ouch! - Am I hurting you?
No, it's just my sunburn.
Noon rest till 3pm!
What's that ship?
- Ferry to Sweden.
Why do so many people
want to leave here?
I've never been on vacation
at the Baltic Sea!
(They sing:)
So lie, you Brothers,
down in God's name,
cool is the evening breeze.
Spare us, God, from punishment
and allow us to sleep calmly
and our sick neighbour too.
(People applauding.)
We are going to depart soon.
This is my husband ...
- Sabine Walter.
We met through our
travels.
See you in a minute, on the bus!
Excuse me.
Lets just sit down!
Shitty that we don't have time.
- Yes.
This is my son, Eric.
Glad to hear you're well.
- Why do you think that?
I'm coming.
That's how you're thanked for
your commitment to the summer vacation.
As they say: Children are our
most valuable good.
The documents are in
the file.
My personal thanks!
- Thank you.
A reward for
our screwing around!
You shouldn't say things like that!
I think you have to be into things
with all your heart.
(Someone rings.)
Come in!
Hang up your coat!
Are you from Berlin?
Thank you.
Why haven't you got in
touch sooner?
I want to marry you.
I want you to marry me.
It's a big opportunity for me.
Five years at that institute!
It's situated in the woods,
in a restricted area.
But they have everything:
Swimming pool, riding arena, cinema, theatre.
And Moscow isn't far.
And one can bring one's wife.
And so I though
I'd ask you.
And what am I supposed to do there?
You'll be my wife.
- What'll I do as your wife?
You'll be the mother of my children.
It sounds a little cheesy,
I know.
I'll be the mother of your children?
You don't believe me?
I do.
Get rid of that!
Why are you wearing glasses?
For fun.
Why didn't you tell me?
- What for?
Glasses made of plain glass!
Give it to me!
Glasses without a purpose?
Let's not talk about that anymore!
Please, you don't need the be angry!
Maybe someone once thought you were
more beautiful with glasses.
Are you on the pill?
- Do I have to be?
Hello.
Here I am.
I'm glad you are.
We thought about it.
It's out of the question.
We can't keep your identity
a secret from the Russians.
We don't want to tell them.
But it'd be too messy.
You think you can control everything!
Right.
But I want to go there, with him!
We love each other and
are going to have a child!
You don't have to have a child.
And if I have one anyway?
Are you watching West German TV?
Why?
They show GDR women
holding up their children
when they climb into the West German
embassy in Prague.
Do you see anything of that
on GDR television?
Do you see?
Some people in this country are asleep.
Those are my worries
at the moment.
So I ask you of all people for
your understanding.
If I couldn't go to Moscow,
would you stay here?
Why?
If I can't go.
But that's why we are going to get married!
- Even if I won't come with you?
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
I'll tell you who the mother
of your children really is.
I live here under a false name
with the consent of the
concerned agencies,
because in the West, I'm
wanted as a terrorist.
Are you a terrorist?
Yes.
I used to be.
But terrorists are idiots
who kill innocent people.
Yes, that's what I
used to do.
But you can't tell me this!
I can't know this!
I have to go there now, though.
No. 15,
please step forward!
Take a seat!
Cigarette?
I came from Berlin.
Whatever. So?
This concerns an ex-colleague
of yours.
Maybe some sort of girlfriend.
She's not here anymore.
We know that.
I'll gladly tell you
what I know.
She immigrated into the GDR
a long time ago, from the West.
I didn't believe it at first.
- Why not?
I had never heard of anything
like that before.
But she was left, politically.
Her parents were killed
in an accident in Amsterdam.
So she was left over alone.
Some time ago, she got word
that she still has some siblings
in the West, so she moved back.
Unfortunately. She was different
from all the others in the shop.
She was a strong supporter of the GDR,
something not everyone is.
I can't say anything bad about her
in this context.
Have others talked about her?
I can't think of anything
like that at the moment.
Why have I been
arrested?
I'm offering you a deal.
You sign, informally,
that we stay in contact.
After that, you
can go home.
It's, at the same time, a sign
that you're loyal to the republic.
Tatjana, the wall is gone now,
and the border is open.
It's just like you always
wanted it to be.
But you are in prison,
because you have been in
contact with a known terrorist.
And this didn't happen to you in the West,
but in the East.
It's so crazy!
(Willy Brandt on television:)
It is certain that nothing
in the other part of Germany
is ever going to be the same
as it used to be.
I'm writing down what I'd say
if you were here.
I imagined a life without
lies and deception,
as you have,
even if different.
It was clear to me, we are trapped in
an unjust, wrong system.
But the guerilla couldn't
achieve liberation,
because no one understood us.
<i>I didn't just want to hide in the GDR,</i>
I was looking for another world.
I wanted to move forward,
not backward.
I hope you'll
manage to get out soon.
The BRD [Federal Republic of Germany] demands
the extradition of those persons.
How do they want to know
they are here?
They've always known.
Through whom?
- Maybe through us.
Why did we hide them then?
Twice, even!
We worked our asses off
to hide them.
Excuse me, comrade General.
I've had people arrested,
just because they might have known about it.
Has everything been a double-cross?
Like in a secret agent flick?
If you don't explain the world to me,
I won't explain it to you either.
You have the addresses?
- I'd rather not touch this affair.
You have to touch a lot of things
before you die.
We did something for them,
not the other way around.
They didn't tell us much
about their secrets.
Maybe they were criminals.
You can look at it like that.
But I'm disappointed
that we abandon them like this.
Do you want to go home
and cry?
Your weapons, please!
That's how accidents happen, girly!
- I'm sorry!
Look!
Unbelievable!
"Terrorist hidden by StaSi." [GDR's secret service]
We've lived with criminals!
Anything for peace!
Read it!
She was part of a choir.
They had money for things like that!
But we couldn't get decent Jeans.
She didn't do anything to or against YOU,
I mean, US.
One cannot live next to
a murderer, though!
This isn't my government anymore.
Maybe you'll never be
better off than now and here!
Here, you cannot lose your job
or be kicked out of your apartment.
You don't know
what you're going to miss out on.
Maybe you'll be able to afford
decent trousers,
but not the arse in those trousers.
You're crazy!
This here was a great attempt,
a revolution.
Despite all the crap,
you were part of it.
It's supposed to be a
world that isn't ruled by money.
Why don't you believe in that anymore?
In yourselves anymore?
We can't do anything for you anymore.
What happened to Friederike?
- You don't know?
I do.
But what happened?
They are going to get you, too.
- This is still the GDR, though!
And in the GDR, you are going to be
arrested, through the people's police.
What a screwed up ending.
East is over there,
west over there.
You're wanted everywhere.
If they cannot find you today,
they are going to hunt you.
Avoid airports and
big train stations.
If you can, forget
we've ever known each other.
I will forget that.
I can give you a ride
for a little way.
Why did you arrest Tatjana?
Susanne!
Open up, it's me!
Hands up!
Against the wall!
Are you Rita Vogt?
I need to pee.
Actually, I cannot take you with me
without a helmet.
You don't know that as an Eastern broad.
You were pretty much cut off.
But I don't have any prejudices.
Thanks.
It not any individual's fault.
Excuse me, I need to pee.
(Engine sound.)
This is the East.
I hope she doesn't drive around here.
She's supposed to have killed several people.
- Here or in the west?
Doesn't matter, order and security
have to exist everywhere.
I won't shoot.
Papers, please!
(Shots)
