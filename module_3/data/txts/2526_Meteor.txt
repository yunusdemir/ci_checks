This can't be right.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Professor.
Dr. Lehman.
Dr. Lehman, these numbers,
they can't be right.
l wish they weren't .
No, look. The mass assumption--
lt's surprisingly hefty, but correct.
l was gonna say too small.
And--and the trajectory,
that means it's heading--
Right for us.
And she is, pardon the melodrama,
a planet killer.
But that's impossible.
l mean, l just checked
the near earth object database
and nobody has logged
anything remotely close.
Unless something hit one,
something big enough to
knock her out of her orbit...
Here, l'm pretty sure it's Kassandra.
No way.
l'm afraid so.
That's 61 miles, about three times
the size of Mount Everest.
Okay, we're--we're talking
extinction event, like the dinosaurs.
What's so funny?
ln Greek mythology,
the sun god Apollo cursed Kassandra
with the power to predict death
and destruction.
So what do we do?
We run the asymmetrical
trajectory algorithm
to find Kassandra's approach vectors.
Send the coordinates to JPL,
and pray there's enough firepower
to blast it from the sky.
Hey, it's me, AGAlN.
l'm heading back to school.
um... l, uh... Grandpa says hi.
l love you.
Call me when you can.
There.
Jenny, l know there's tension
between you and your dad.
You've had words, but believe me,
they are just words.
He loves you very much.
Right, well, you know,
if he ever finds the time,
he can tell me that himself.
Grandpa says hi.
l love you.
Perfect timing, kid.
Cal?
ln here.
You, uh, conserving electricity?
Yeah, on a cop salary, you betcha.
So...
So...
You called me.
l thought we talked about
going in the morning.
You want to go now?
Why not?
Did you tell Mary?
Yeah, l told her.
What'd she say?
Jesus.
Don't ! Get it up!
Don't look away, jack.
Look at your handiwork!
l said look!
You might as well pull
the trigger yourself, buddy boy.
What does it have to...?
What'd you think was
gonna happen, Jack?
l turn myself in. you become
a big hero bringing in the dirty cop,
ex-partner to boot.
Cal, l can help.
l can help you. l can.
Thanks, Jack. But l think
l can handle it from here.
Hello.
Dr. Chetwyn? lt's lmogene O'Neill.
lmogene. Uh, sweetheart...
We have an emergency,
and Dr. Lehman--
An emergency?
You mean another emergency?
Dr. Chetwyn--
Now, if you had
just taken the job at JPL,
you wouldn't always be off on
these wild goose chases with Daniel.
No, no. lt's not a goose chase.
Okay. l'm gonna put you
on speakerphone.
Asteroid 114 Kassandra
is coming right at us.
l need you to get to sac-norad on this.
Kassandra is a main belt asteroid,
Daniel.
lt's a minor planet, for god's sake.
lts closest pass to us is 400,000 miles
outside of earth's orbit.
And she was knocked off course
after an impact with a comet.
You might be able to see her
with near earth radar by morning.
But by then, it'll be too late.
Get to JPL now! We don't have--
Ah, we don't have much time.
Oh, god, Daniel.
Daniel, go to bed, all right?
l'll look into it
when l get to the office.
We're coming right to you.
We have the numbers to show you.
But right now, every minute counts.
The harbingers that
are being knocked loose
by the initial collision
are already here.
We have maybe 24 hours before--
l know what harbingers are,
Dr. Lehman.
They belong to you, don't they?
They're the reason you're alive now.
You took my family from me, Jack.
Now l'm gonna return the favor.
l'm gonna pay a little visit
to jenny out there at
that fancy college of hers.
Oh, your dad lives out that way too,
doesn't he?
Convenient.
Mom, dad, wake up.
-What?
-What, baby?
What, Mikey?
You gotta check this out.
You okay?
Okay.
Oh, wow. That's cool.
Russ.
Come here, quick. Have a look.
That's amazing.
lt's bright.
Yeah.
lt's ... it's kind of...
Back away from the window.
Go! Go! Down in the cellar!
Now, when you get there,
l want you to call me.
Grandpa, it's gonna be too late.
-l don't care how late it is.
-Keith.
lt's Russ Hapscomb.
There--there's a fire at his place.
He said a meteor
crashed in his field.
What?
All right,
get the fire department up there.
We'll be right behind 'em.
Yes, sir.
l gotta run, sweetheart.
Did he really just say meteor?
The boy's got an imagination.
Now, listen, l want you
to drive the speed limit.
Okay.
Give me a hug.
l love you, grandpa.
l love you too, sweetheart.
Thanks for coming.
l know that you're not
a huge fan of Dr. Chetwyn.
But don't you think
he's gonna figure this all out
when he gets to JPL
and looks at the radar readouts?
l mean, wh--why are we--
why are we going?
We were the only
ones monitoring the initial impact,
so they'll need our data to
plot an intercept trajectory.
Plus, none of their systems
allow for enough variables.
Look, Dr. Lehman, please don't
take this the wrong way but...
Come on out with it.
Why are we going?
He didn't believe you.
Trust me, he'll believe us
when we get there.
Why?
Because by then,
lots more rocks will have fallen.
Lots more people will be dead.
Ladies and gentlemen,
you were awoken from your beds
and flown here
in the dead of the night
because somewhere in your past,
you either volunteered for or were
volunteered by your agency for a seat
on the near Earth Object
Emergency Response Task Force.
Now, for those of you
who don't know me,
l'm General Brasser of
the Army Space Program,
and l have been appointed by
the president to lead this task force
in solving the crisis we face today.
Put simply,
an interplanetary dust storm
seems to be headed our way.
Uh, hi. Um... Nate Chetwyn, JPL.
Ah, the rocket scientist. Welcome.
ln the last six hours,
we've had multiple meteor impacts
on the west coast of the United States.
We're still compiling data from
the navy and various satellites.
But we can estimate that
there have been at least other impacts
in the Pacific Ocean.
Now, Dr. Chetwyn, l assume
you've got a team tracking this.
Well, l--l've only recently
been briefed on all of this.
The--the information's
been trickling in and...
But yes, um, we--
we got word a few hours ago
from one of our observatories
in the meteor tracking network.
Now, the--
the data is still being verified.
But, um, there is the possibility
that a comet has struck an asteroid.
And if that's true, then the increased
meteor activity
we're experiencing is the, uh,
debris from that initial collision.
How big can these rocks get?
Anything from a pebble to
the size of a truck.
And the bad news?
The comet collision may have altered
the parent asteroid's
trajectory enough that...
it may be on its way to us, too.
Size? Mass? Velocity?
He's calculating that as we speak.
The worst-case scenario.
We may be looking at 114th Kassandra,
a main belt asteroid.
lt's large enough to be
considered a small planet.
She's 60 miles in diameter
and her impact with earth
would be enough to end life
as we know it.
You want the worst-case scenario.
Time till impact?
Still calculating.
But my--my best guesstimate
is 24-48 hours.
Unfortunately, if it is Kassandra,
you're gonna have to
destroy her long before that,
because if--if we hit her when
she's too low in our atmosphere,
the--the debris fallout
from the explosion...
lt would be catastrophic.
Okay, people. We got our hands full.
Let's get moving.
Dr. Chetwyn, l need a full workup
on the asteroid we're dealing with
and a trajectory for
an ideal interception point.
And l need it in minutes or less.
l know it's early.
Don't tell me how early it is.
l need you
at your desk in ten minutes.
And get me Dr. Lehman now.
Just gonna get your numbers, sir.
Okay.
Trust me. Stark's not gonna get far.
Jack, l'm gonna do everything l can.
Jesus, cap, that's not enough.
lt's Calvin.
You know him.
Look, this is jenny we're talking about.
l know, man.
But do you see
what's goin' on out there?
Tom.
Tom, you used to bounce her
on your knee.
Please.
Well, he's not getting far, all right?
Who is that? ls that about jenny?
lt's the mayor.
You call me if you hear anything.
Will do.
Now get some rest, would you?
Come on, baby.
Sorry, all circuits are busy.
Please try your call again later.
We're following this breaking story.
The AP is reporting a large meteor
impact in Taft, California,
with additional impacts
in other areas along
the west coast and the Pacific Ocean.
NASA officials have scheduled
a press conference
one half hour from now.
And we expect
some answers regarding
what seems to be
the largest in recorded history.
Small meteors collide with the earth
all the time but the impact
is so minor...
Hey, you guys, check it out.
lt's beautiful.
l bet it's even better up
in the mountains. Come on.
Hey.
Forget something?
Oh, thank you. Maya, you rock.
Best roommate ever.
Come on. We gotta roll.
See ya.
This is awful.
Yeah.
Hey.
We got out, right?
Do you want me to stay home?
No, no, no. you--you go on.
Someone's got to pay the bills.
Yeah, but you shouldn't have to
deal with all this by yourself.
Hey, hey, at least someone's
enjoying this.
He's still here?
Yeah. We missed the bus
in all the excitement.
l'll take him in.
No, no. l'll do it.
lt'll give us
some good mother/son time.
Shouldn't l stay and help?
Nice try. Come on. Get in the car.
l'll try to get off early, all right?
Hey, Russell!
The firemen tell me it's safe now.
You might want to come take a look.
Well, how bad is it?
See for yourself.
You get a chance to
watch the news this morning?
No, the power's still out.
Well, apparently, uh, a few of
these things hit some time last night.
Some kind of freak meteor shower.
Most of them landed in the pacific,
except for this one.
Ooh, hi. My radiator overheated.
Can l get water?
-Thank you.
-Thanks.
Have a good day.
Suspect is still at large. Repeat.
Detective Calvin Stark is
considered armed and dangerous.
Use extreme caution. All units.
All units respond a 511
at 11465 High View Drive.
Hello.
lmogene, it's Nate Chetwyn.
ls Daniel with you?
l'm right here.
Dan. l'm sorry.
l--l was wrong about Kassandra.
Have you had a chance to
calculate trajectory?
You're breaking up. Call us back.
We're standing by
for a missile launch.
No, no! Don't launch!
You don't have the trajectory right!
Hello?
He doesn't have
the original impact coordinates.
He's using an algorithm
l gave him years ago.
They're gonna miss. Get him back!
No signal.
Ha. He said sorry.
What?
He apologized.
l think he actually apologized.
Oh, great.
No, ma'am, l'm not trying to
tell you how to do your job.
But you need to get the president to
address the country right away
or we will have widespread panic.
Thank you, ma'am.
Sir. Just heard from NASA.
Near-earth satellite radar confirms
that it's 114 Kassandra.
Colonel Beck,
how long till missile launch?
Twenty-one minutes, sir.
Perfect. Let's get a live feed in five.
Yes, sir. And l still need the--
Dr. Chetwyn,
how about those coordinates?
l've got them, sir.
l'm just double-checking them.
We need them now.
Okay. You got it.
l got it.
Perfect.
You've reached the cell phone of
Dr. Lehman. Please leave a message.
Dr. Lehman, lmogene, it--it's Nate.
We're--we're about to launch,
and l need to confirm
the kassandra trajectory with you.
There's --there's something wrong
with the numbers.
Just call, call, call.
-Whoa!
-Watch out, sorry.
Will you help me out, please?
Thank you.
Russell Hapscomb, meteor man.
Simon. Long time.
Yeah, a long time.
Hey, what's goin' on here?
l thought my house
was the only one that got hit.
Some fema guy told people
to stock up so...
Wow.
Yeah. Wow is right.
Hey! That's my water.
You got your name on this?
l'm over here getting milk
before they run out of that too.
Yeah, well, look, sorry, sir.
l said that's my water.
lt's for my family.
Hey, relax...
Why don't you
just get your ass out of my town
and crawl back to
where you came from?
Come again?
Just let's let it go.
He's not worth it.
Yeah, let it go.
There's more water over there.
You have yourself a nice day...sir.
Heard what he said to me?
Yeah, l heard.
l was born here.
Some mouth.
Yeah. That mouth gonna
get his ass cancelled.
You did the right thing.
Damn it. l think it's dead. Sorry.
Don't panic.
We have to keep our heads.
See if you can wave someone down.
They always stop for a girl.
Hey! Hey, stop!
Great. Hey, look.
l'll get the phone.
Hey!
Dr. Lehman. Dr. Lehman!
Oh, God. Dr. Lehman.
The laptop.
Don't speak. Shh, don't try to speak.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god, Dr. Lehman.
Get it.
No.
Dr. Lehman.
Dr. Lehman!
l don't know what to do.
l don't know what to do.
Now here's a list of alternate routes to
get you home from our eye in the sky.
lf you're trying to head north
from the 405, allow for extra time.
Make sure you--
Come on, answer, baby. Answer.
Hi, it's jenny. Leave a message.
Jenny. Listen to me. lt's your dad.
Listen very carefully.
You are in real danger.
Stark, my--my ex-partner, Calvin Stark.
You remember him?
Well, he's done something terrible,
baby.
You are in danger, okay?
As soon as you get this message,
you need to call-
no, you need to run to
the police station in town
and have them call me
or Captain Finnegan at
LAPD precinct immediately.
All right? This is for real, baby.
All right? l love you.
Just go. Go now.
Due to the unpredictable nature of
the current meteor shower crisis,
all motorists--
Told you, l knew a shortcut.
Yeah, it sure beats the parking
lot on the side.
lt is recommended that
all drivers safely exit
and proceed to
the nearest public shelter.
Maybe we should go back.
Why?
l mean, things are falling
out of the sky.
They're telling people to
stay off the road.
People are sheep. They overreact.
Just think... hot tub. Hot tub. Hot tub.
l'm serious.
Me too. There's also
a fully stocked bar.
Forty acres of pristine forest.
Hey, babe. lf the world's ending,
l'd rather be with you.
Thanks.
You are so full of it.
Come on. That was for real.
Yeah. Mm-mm-mm-mm.
l tell you what, if you're a good boy
the rest of the way,
l might let you fish that out.
Oww!
You stopped a fight over water?
Yeah. l'm telling you,
our house gets hit,
but it's everyone else around here
who's freakin' out.
You okay?
Yeah, l'm fine.
Just fixin' up the windows
before Michael gets home.
l hear they're letting
the kids out early.
-Dr. Hapscomb, we need you stat.
-All right?
You heard that, babe.
l love you. l gotta go.
Watch it. Oh!
Excuse me!
Oh, come on. What are you doing?
Out of my way.
Oh, l'm -- that's rude.
Sorry, sorry.
They've been all over the radio and TV.
What was it fema said?
What was his big message?
Stay off the roads like it's
some freakin' kind of travel advisory.
Unbelievable.
That's your tax dollars
at work right there.
l've been all over town.
People starting' to
hoard food and supplies.
Next thing, everyone's gonna be
holed up in their houses.
And that's when the lowlifes are
gonna be coming' out of the woodwork.
Havin' a slow day at the garage?
Hello, chief.
Dwight.
You boys, uh, plannin' a huntin' trip?
Well, you know,
duck season's right around the corner.
Well, today might be
a good day to stay indoors.
Yeah. But what
if you have some real trouble?
You're gonna need
some god-fearin' boys at your side.
What l need is for people to
stay nice and calm,
not runnin' around with weapons.
l don't recall martial law
being declared.
We have the right to assemble.
Dwight... You are beginning to annoy me.
That would not be in your best interest.
Are you threatening me?
l'm not threatening you.
l'm just tellin' you how it is.
Now l suggest you take care of
your families rather than your guns.
So, uh, where in Los Angeles you--
you need to go?
Uh, JPL. Jet Propulsion Laboratories.
lt's just off the 210th.
Thanks for picking me up.
You remind me of my daughter.
And l never let her walk alone.
As of yet, we have heard
no official word on what's going on.
But with the meteor strikes increasing,
what started out as
an especially beautiful sunrise
might turn out to be the first
warning sign of a national emergency.
Maybe they'll
cancel school tomorrow.
-Aw, Mickey's got a girlfriend!
-Hey, if you ever want a real man--
Leave her alone.
Or what?
He ain't gonna help you.
Doofus can't protect his woman.
Nope.
Quit it.
Oh, is doofus gonna cry?
Big mistake.
Coordinates confirmed?
Yeah.
Your confidence is overwhelming.
Punch it.
We're locked in.
Launch codes.
Hot and ready, sir.
We're go for launch, sir.
Call it, colonel.
On my mark, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3...
Talk to me, people.
We--we lost 'em, sir. l-l got no feeds.
Me neither. They're off line.
The satellite.
Speak up.
Are we on satellite com link
with the launch site?
That's right.
l think the satellite got hit.
The harbingers.
The--the debris from
the initial comet impact.
Quigley. Yes. Yes. Confirmed?
Yes. Roger that. Please stand by.
Sir, missiles are intact.
We just lost the satellite feeds.
Recommendations.
Launch based on
the trajectory model, sir.
No. No! Without satellite guidance,
l--l advise against that.
The trajectory computation,
it--it's not foolproof.
l need more time.
Christ.
Well, l'm sorry.
l don't think we should be hurling
nuclear weapons blindly!
Pardon me, Dr. Chetwyn,
but what the hell have you been
doing all this time?
The best l can.
We've never dealt with
this big an asteroid mass,
and not at this proximity.
And the--the algorithm
l'm using isn't working.
For some reason,
l can't reach the man that created it.
Well, find him for Christ's sake!
Where is he?
He's on his way in from Mexico.
Mexico?
What the hell is he doing in Mexico
if he's so integral to this whole thing?
l fired him. He went crazy.
Help Dr. Chetwyn to find his man.
Get the White House involved.
Call in the god damn marines.
We need that trajectory on
this thing right away, now!
l'm sorry, but it's not my fault.
The thing overheated, okay?
The car is a piece of crap. Yeah?
Oh, that's nice. Nice. Yeah. Jackass!
Sorry, ma'am. LAPD.
l'm gonna have to
commandeer your vehicle.
Police emergency.
You gave me a heart attack.
Step away from the car, please.
Have you seen
what's happening out there?
l gotta get home.
Ma'am, l'm gonna have to insist.
Officer, please.
Please, l live
all the way in Palm Vista.
My kids are waiting.
l'll never make it on foot.
Palm Vista.
You live out near the college?
Yeah.
My lucky day. Do you mind
if l bother you for a ride?
Yes. Of course l'll take you
wherever you need to go. Pop in.
Well, thank you, ma'am.
Still nothing?
Nada.
The little one starts school today.
l'm sorry.
Oh, no. it's okay. lt's okay.
ls okay if l, uh, get you to border?
No, no. Look, l really--
l have to--
l'm very sorry, senorita.
l--l just need to get to
my familia, you know.
Of course.
Wait. ls that a police station?
Si!
Great. Well, maybe they could
radio the embassy or call JPL for me.
Very good idea, senorita.
Yes, very good.
Gracias. Thank you so much.
De nada.
Are you sure you're
going to be okay?
Si. Yeah.
You go home to your family.
Gracias. Buenas suerte.
Good luck to you too.
Oh, god.
Yeah. lt's a big rock.
And lift. Got it?
Double check that fuel line.
Come on, let's go.
Hey!
What about the rest of these kids?
We're full up.
We gotta take this group to--
to High View
and this next one gotta
go to coast central.
You've only got one ambulance?
We got accidents all over.
lt's insane.
l don't believe it.
All right, l want you to get over to
Dylan's car dealership
as soon as possible.
Round up every available man.
Get every truck and van over here
just as soon as you can.
Michael?
You just take it easy, son.
You're gonna be fine.
Uh, we'll get you to the hospital
and l'll make sure your mom
and dad are there to meet you, okay?
Sir, everyone's losing
satellite coverage,
NSA, Pentagon, commercial networks.
How big can these dust storms get?
Don't think of it as dust.
l'm sure our satellite
and every satellite worldwide
is gettin' shredded to pieces.
Let's not lose it, people.
we won the second
World War without satellites.
We're not gonna give it up now.
Ground wire all communications.
Sir. What if he can't solve it?
Well, at some point, the thing
will be visible on ground radar.
Which is another reason that
l think we should save
our biggest missiles for them.
We also may be underestimating
the amount of firepower
we're gonna need here.
Colonel Beck has targeted
for 500 missions in his career.
General, we're not talking about
a surgical strike on Baghdad.
You're trying to pulverize
a giant rock
that's four times
the size of Manhattan into
tiny little pieces small enough
so the fallout,
if we're lucky enough to hit it,
doesn't kill us anyway.
We got one chance at this thing.
l think we all better get it right.
We'll take that under advisement.
l want you to get your numbers straight.
Hello.
What? Where?
Where?! l'm coming.
Hey, how ya holdin' up?
l'm fine.
Thanks for checkin' in
and thanks for the wheels.
l owe ya.
You're gonna be putting my kids
through college after they fire my ass.
You won't get fired.
l'll get Finnegan to vouch for you.
All right. l trust you, handsome.
You're the woman of my dreams,
Trish. Gotta go.
Hello?
Hola.
Hello.
Hola.
Hello.
Hola.
l'm sorry.
l didn't see you. No lo vi.
Ah, Americana.
Si. Yes.
l have to get to
Jet Propulsion Laboratories
in Los Angeles.
There's information on this computer
that's very important
the government needs.
l-- l'm a scientist and l'm -
l'm working on the meteors
that are--that are coming down.
lt--it's very, very important.
This, uh, very, um,
como se dice, importante?
Urgent, huh?
Si. Yes.
Why don't you just call them
on the telefono?
Yes. Right!
Vamanos. Otro oficina.
We have--they have phones, uh,
how you say, uh, long distance.
Oh, thank you.
yeah. Office.
Okay.
-Ow, please.
-What the hell, Carlo?
Ella estaba snooping around.
She's alone.
Please. Please, please.
l'm just trying to get to Los Angeles.
She's kinda cute, huh?
l mean, like this meteor thing,
l mean, sure, l'm worried.
l mean, who wouldn't be?
But it's kind of exciting, you know?
l mean, l'm no crazy,
but l like a little adventure
every now and then.
So are you married?
Yes.
Happily?
l guess l could tell you that.
Yeah?
But then l'd have to kill you.
That was good!
You actually had me on that one.
You'd have to kill me.
Casualty report.
Only 41 so far nationwide,
which is a minor miracle.
lnjuries are in the hundreds, sir.
Last batch was
the second bus full of kids.
lt's getting ugly.
General, here you go.
We need to get people underground.
How are we comin' with that?
We've opened shelters
in every conceivable location.
Underground parking lots,
malls, old bomb shelters,
any tunnel
that's not jammed with traffic.
Even a few working mine shafts.
And l've got word
from the pentagon
so we'll open civilian access to
subterranean facilities.
Mostly old missile storage in
Arkansas, ldaho, lowa, and Kansas,
and working on more, sir.
General,
we've got an image on ground radar.
on screen, please.
Oh, my god, they're getting larger.
Which one of these is Kassandra?
We can't see kassandra yet.
All right, people, things are
about to get a whole lot worse.
We need to get people underground,
and we need to get the National Guard
out to guide them there.
More importantly, Colonel Beck.
Uh, missile deployment nearly complete.
we've got every
major population center covered
with stingers and patriot batteries
in the rural areas.
Roger that. good work.
Okay, people. Let's move!
Sir.
Did you find them?
The Mexican police
found Dr. Lehman, sir.
Excellent.
They found him dead, sir.
A suspected hit-and-run.
What about lmogene, his assistant?
They didn't find anyone else, sir.
l'm sorry.
Move out! Steady twos. let's go.
Roger, we're in position.
permission to fire.
Charlie 11, Charlie 11.
This is Charlie 01-.
Have visual contact.
Let's go!
Roger, 22 , we've got inner...
What the hell?
What's the problem, officer?
You'll have to turn back
and exit at that detour sign you
just ignored.
That'll lead you to a pick-up point.
They'll take you
to a shelter from there.
l'm sorry, but that's unacceptable,
all right?
Shut up. Do as he says.
We have a mass casualty accident.
A spillover at Miami General.
How many?
Seven children. A school bus.
Christ. Uh, how far away are they?
They're here?
Here? Did they forgot to call ahead?
Well, the phones are screwed up.
The radios are messy. Chelsea.
What? What?
The bus-- it's from Michael's school.
God.
Okay, baby is hypo, 90 over 66.
Pulse is tachy. lnternal injuries.
l've got two units of plasma lV.
Push and prep for surgery. Go.
Oh, god.
180 over 90. resp. is shallow,
but pulse is holding up.
Possible concussion.
He's been out-- doctor.
Chelsea, what do we do?
My baby. Oh, my baby.
Dr. Hapscomb.
Uh, ten units of saline lV push,
x-ray and cat scan.
Move! Next patient.
Oh. Oh, crap. The gas.
God, l'm such an idiot.
You hadn't filled up?
No, l mean everything
was just so crazy,
and l just--
just wanted to get home.
You passed two or three gas stations.
l know. Kind of funny, you know.
-Shut up.
-lt's just kind of funny.
l mean, here l am--
-Shut the hell up.
-Get off me.
Hey, get you want to
bag these things, please?
All right.
All right. This is ridiculous.
We're going as fast as we can, sir.
Well, you're not going fast enough.
l gotta get home to my kids.
Can we go home?
Hush.
Excuse me. Come on.
Sir, you didn't pay for that.
Sir, freeze!
Please, put those things down,
and get out.
Man, l got kids.
Let him go!
Stop.
Please. What are you gonna do,
shoot me over two gallons of water?
No, but l sure the hell will.
We ain't gonna put up
with any of this thievery.
We're not gonna tolerate
any lawlessness.
That's right, Dwight.
you're absolutely right.
That's why you need to go home.
l'm just trying to lend
a helping hand here, chief.
You've helped enough.
Time to go home now.
And if l see either of you boys
with your pea-shooters out again,
l will confiscate them, and l will
melt them down for scrap iron.
Get him to the hospital.
When he's up to it,
l suggest he press charges.
Yes, sir.
Things are starting to
fall apart here.
you know, l mean no disrespect,
but you're not getting any younger,
and this place was being robbed,
and you came in way late.
Please, just go. Okay, l'll settle--
Hey, nobody's talking to you.
Now get him home.
He needs to cool off.
Get him some ice.
There's no need for that.
You know, he's got a point.
We're spending a lot of time
tearing each other apart.
We need to lend each other a hand.
Now, l want you all to go home.
l want you to pick up your kids,
some food, some blankets,
whatever medicine you need,
and then head over to
the fallout shelter at the high school.
You'll be safe there.
We'll do everything
we can to make you comfortable.
And remember,
we're all in this together.
We need to look out for each other.
So tell your friends
and tell your neighbors.
let's help each other.
Go on home.
Let's do what he said.
You can pay me later.
Here's something for your boys.
Just go home, everybody. lt's okay.
ln what experts are calling
a one-in-a-million tragedy,
a meteor has struck down
a passenger plane,
killing all passengers and crew.
The real tragedy is
that the aircraft was
struck while trying to land minutes
after the FAA suspended
all air traffic in Northern America
because of the meteor storm
that has turned this
into one of the most tragic days
in modern history.
Sir, incoming.
Right over downtown LA.
And it's a big one.
Patch it through to
the ground commander.
Let's go!
Alpha team, you're main effort!
Bravo team,
get ready to shoot if they miss!
Let's go!
We're hot! Line 'em up!
They nailed it!
Good shootin, army!
You're a glass-half-empty
kind of guy, aren't you?
We don't have enough missiles
to knock them all down.
The United States arsenal
has a lot of assets.
You better save
most of them for Kassandra,
or we're all dead, no matter what.
How low is the trajectory?
Working on it.
How can any man say
this is not the lord's wrath?
Repent now, for the hour of
judgment is at hand!
Oh, l have gazed through a glass
that has shown me the future.
This is the emergency broadcast service.
Stand by for official instructions
from state and federal authorities.
All roads and highways,
including the Eisenhower
interstate highway system,
are closed to all traffic
until further notice,
with the exception of public safety,
emergency medical,
and military vehicles.
All citizens are strongly urged...
Hey, doctor, doctor.
Over here, this way.
Put her in this room.
Okay, hurry up.
We're gonna lose him.
Local burns on, uh, extremities.
Get a line in.
Did you check on Michael?
Yeah, his vitals are stable.
Cat scan was negative.
Look, do you want--
No, not right now.
l gotta finish up here.
Michael's stable.
He's luckier than this poor kid.
Now, the shirt.
Please, if l don't get to JPL,
we're all gonna die.
The camiseta! The shirt!
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Please, please,
you don't have to do this.
Please, please.
Please, don't .
we have to get to shelter.
Now the rest.
Do you wanna die?
lf l die today,
l will die con un smile in my face.
Screw it. l'll do it myself.
On your knees, now.
Let's go, move up! go! go!
Tell 'em we're ready to go with 21, go!
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry along!
Bring 'er up. Let's see it.
On target!
Let's go, come on!
Emergency services have been
stretched to the limit.
l can't believe
they made me leave my 'vette.
Squad, fall in.
Shut the hell up about
your damn car already.
Sorry, folks!
We just got word from the shelter.
That's all the room we've got.
Oh, god. They can't .
That's not right!
You can't just leave us out here!
We're way overcrowded,
and there's plenty of room at
the shelter just over in Carville.
l can't walk 15 miles!
l've got two kids.
Please, officer, please.
Come on. Leave it alone.
Sir, sir!
Miss, you need to
get back on the truck.
You can let her in.
l'm sure we can squeeze her in.
The shelter is dangerously
overcrowded as it is.
Please.
Folks, the sooner you get moving,
the sooner you'll get there.
Come on.
You get on the truck.
We'll give you our place.
Oh, honey, l couldn't .
No, we can walk miles.
You can't .
Come on, let's go.
What?
Let her on the truck.
My boyfriend and l are leaving.
There are three of them.
lt's a baby.
You're being ridiculous.
Don't worry, you just go with him.
We'll be fine.
Come on, it's not our fault
that we got here first.
Please, someone,
this lady has kids.
Jenny!
You're making a scene.
We'll go.
God bless you. God bless you!
Move out!
Do you think we'll make it
to Carville by nightfall?
Not with the freeway shut down.
we should find someplace to crash.
l know somewhere.
-Oh, yeah?
-They've got a hot tub.
Dad, hey.
Oh, thank god. Are you okay?
Mom, come on. lt's cool, l'm okay.
Hey.
He's fine. he just--
he just has a minor concussion.
l knew that thick head
was good for something.
Very funny, dad.
l'm sorry, Mr. Hapscomb.
What's wrong?
The supply truck. it didn't come.
No answer in the company.
Oh, crap.
What is it?
Today, of all days, we were supposed to
be restocked on half our meds.
But the truck never showed.
l guess, given everything...
and we're out of really basic stuff,
like penicillin, disinfectant.
l already shouldn't be performing
half the procedures l'm doing.
What about the pharmacy?
What do you mean?
Grangers.
Their daughter's in my class.
Wouldn't they have
some of the stuff you need?
Yeah, yeah. l don't know
why l didn't think of that.
Well, you've been busy, honey.
Do you think they're open?
Well, l know Dan Granger.
He'll definitely help out regardless.
Just make a list.
Your father is a genius.
l love you. l love you!
Get a room, people.
You make a list.
l'll go call ahead to the pharmacy.
Get some rest, okay?
You take care of your mom.
Come on. Move!
Damn it!
Stop your vehicle, ma'am.
Keep your hands where l can see 'em.
What's your hurry?
l'm an American citizen, and l'm --
Are you a police officer, ma'am?
No, but--
Step out of the car, please.
You don't understand.
Now, ma'am.
My name is lmogene O'Neill.
And, um, l'm working on
the meteor task force so--
There's a gun in the car.
What?
She's got a firearm, Johnny!
No, no, no. That is not my gun.
Would you turn around
and face the vehicle, please?
Turn around,
face the vehicle, please.
But...
Face the vehicle. Put your hands out.
Spread your legs.
Please, l have to get to a phone.
l have coordinates
that Dr. Chetwyn-
the government needs to
shoot down the asteroid.
All right, she's clean.
May l see your passport, please?
Yes, of course.
Damn it. My jacket.
My jacket, l left my jacket
back at the police station.
l see. Why are you driving
a Mexican police car.
Because l was... l was attacked.
By these two men.
And--and they killed these
two officers back at the police station.
All right, uh, you're gonna
have to come with me, please.
No, you're not listening to
me here, okay?!
We don't have time!
Then we'd better get
this sorted out quickly.
We're getting slammed.
The frequency of the rocks coming
through the atmosphere is increasing,
and they're getting bigger.
The hits are measuring
on the Richter scale
and we're starting to miss.
Christ. Casualty count?
lt's over a thousand.
Sir, we got two monsters
heading for Huntsville, New York,
and no patriot missiles in range.
Population?
17,000. l grew up a couple
towns from there.
l got a sub off the coast.
Saab missiles will vaporize this.
Wait, wait, wait-- once again,
we can't afford to
waste the big missiles.
we gotta save everything
we got for kassandra herself!
So, what, we're just supposed to
let 17,000 people die?
l don't know!
But what good is saving 70,000
you lose the whole planet
in the morning?!
So aren't most people
in shelters by now?
Some--it's taking time.
Sir, l have two more heading for towns
in North Dakota and Minnesota.
Same scenario-- out of patriot range.
All right, general, you cannot--
Enough!
The next thing l want to hear
from you are the coordinates for
where to hit the asteroid.
l'm sorry.
But l will not sacrifice
all these people.
Take whatever you need,
knock down anything you can.
You heard the man--
all subs, all silos, spit 'em up!
to determine...
There's food and water down there.
You'll be safe.
l got these from Myrna at the motel.
Good work. get 'em down there.
We're filling up fast.
You got it.
Uh, here.
Here you go, ma'am.
First stairway to the right,
sweetheart.
Chief, he's got a gun!
You think you can sucker punch me
and get away with it, old man?
No sir! You do not disrespect me.
Son... it may seem to you like you
have the drop on me,
but l can assure you,
it only seems that way.
Don't forget, l do this for a living.
So l can guarantee you this.
First, l will disarm you,
and then l will shoot you dead.
You don't want that, now, do you?
Do you?
You want respect, Dwight?
You got to earn it.
Well, there's your chance.
That sound-- that's our challenge.
That's the good lord
throwin' down his gauntlet,
askin' us who we are
and what we're made of.
He wants to know what we're capable
of doing in the face of adversity.
Whether we'll stick together,
or whether we'll just fall apart.
Now, all of us could be
dead here in a split second.
But before we go,
we each of us have to answer the call.
What's your answer, Dwight?
How can l help?
You made the right choice.
Lots of people downstairs
need help getting set up.
l called your father myself,
still no answer.
l'm sorry. Try to get some rest, okay?
The two of you.
My mom's a really good doctor.
She's gonna fix him up. You'll see.
TV just went out. God.
-Mom? Mom! Mom!
-l apologize.
We are experiencing technical...
technical difficulties.
Again, federal off--
are advising every--
to get to a shelter.
Maya...
Ohh...Mr. Crowe?
l didn't mean to scare you.
Where's jenny?
Uh, she went to the cabin
for the weekend with Jeff.
l just gave the address to
your partner.
Calvin was here already?
How long ago?
Uh...half an hour ago?
And you told him where she was?
Yeah, l'm sorry.
He said you had your hands full
and you asked him to get her home,
what with the meteors and all.
Doesn't he work with you?
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.
Um...do you have the address?
Uh...here.
All right, thanks.
Shouldn't you been to the shelter?
l'm on my way.
All right, well, get a move on.
Oh, my god.
Ah, we are now officially out of meds.
Okay. Okay, move! Everybody out!
Everybody out! Out, out!
Thanks for the help, pal.
l really mean it.
lt was good of you
to help a brother out.
You're a good man.
Are you people gonna
come talk to me!
You got quite a temper.
We're all gonna die--
unless you talk to me.
l've been doing this job for years.
First time l ever heard that.
l am a scientist. l am working--
Just hold on, ma'am.
They say one of them meteors hit
some computer routing thing in Nevada.
So we got no internet at all.
l can't check your identity
until we're up and running.
Do you know what happens
when a class-one asteroid
hits a class-one comet?
No, ma'am.
lt gets knocked off course.
lts trajectory becomes unknowable.
Unless you know exactly how to look.
And when it hits the earth...
We all go home to the good lord.
You're a man of faith.
Look me in the eye
and tell me l'm lying.
Now you're playing me, miss.
Wait! Wait.
Lock me up, put me in a cell.
Keep me here forever.
l don't care!
Just call Jet Propulsion laboratories.
Tell them that you have
Daniel Lehman's computer.
You have the asymmetrical
trajectory algorithm.
l will write this down for you.
Please, we're running out of time.
l'll tell you what.
l'll get you a phone.
Thank you!
You're really scared, aren't you?
l'm terrified.
Come on.
Just take her out that way.
Okay, thank God.
Where are you going?
Yeah, second floor is as stable.
No, l have to get my son.
The damage was not confined to
the actual impact area
as this spectacular point...
l calculated the most
likely course for Cassandra,
l had flying shots
but then no shots at all.
lt started in the early morning hours
just after the San Clemente strike,
firemen...
We have about an
11 minute window, 13 tops.
She's about to enter the atmosphere
and as you know
we'll have it if we hit her too low.
The plug is in, watch in five minutes.
Mr. President? We're launched.
Dr. Chetwyn, there's an image
in the AOL in 19-30.
Wait.
Excuse me, Mr. President, what?
lt's Lehman's assistant,
she may have an update.
lmogene.
l'm running
the A-symmetrical algorithm
on Cassandra's trajectory.
l know, l know.
l've been running them all day.
The 3-D analytics don't hold up.
These are big numbers,
they are going off the chart.
That's what Dr. Lehman
was trying to tell you.
He revised the algorithm.
l've been trying to get this
so you could plug it
into your mainframe.
lmogene.
But we're going to
have to rely on the laptop.
l've used
a much smaller settling ratio.
No, no, we're waiting to launch.
Will you just give me five minutes?
l need the trajectory now.
lt's been hours since Dr. Lehman...
At last we have the numbers.
Am l holding the launch?
-lmogene, now, now.
-We're going in two minutes.
Okay, here we go, here we go.
l got it.
Hold on, hold the launch,
hold the launch.
Oh, c'mon, general?
l got the trajectory.
lmogene, l'm putting you
on the speaker phone.
Give me the trajectories now, go, go.
Cassandra's trajectories is from
5-17-46 descending to 0-2-20-0-6.
l repeat, it's got it.
Sir, do l reprogram the launch?
How sure are you of these numbers?
l am more sure than of
anything else we've got.
Dan Lehman was a genius.
Who you fired
because he was crazy.
Sir?
Reprogram in the new numbers.
Hit it hard, to try to kill her.
Thank you, miss.
l think we're quite clear
on that vine now.
Mr. President, we're launched, go.
New coordinates, reset the clocks.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...
We'll never get too level,
get the paramedics ready,
there's going to be debris
and a lot of it.
Three, two, one, launch.
The birds are away.
They're still on radar blank,
how do we know if we hit it?
lt would fall on our heads, we'd know.
Get the missile near to the bunk right
ahead to Edwards Air Force Base,
l need her on a secure hard line.
Don't fly her,
there's going to be a ton of debris.
Ground all the flights, military too.
Let's do it, ground all flights.
Get missile near at Edwards,
use any means necessary.
Yes, sir.
Oh, thank you.
What's wrong?
You know l'm not sure.
l was extrapolating Dr. Lehman's formula
and the assumption is not right.
One minute to intercept.
Murphy, sir?
Yes, sir.
She's right here.
Of course, sir.
Thank you, sir.
That was the Vice-President?
Of what?
The Vice-President of the United States.
They need you at
Edwards Air Force Base ASAP.
Okay, hang on.
Can you do that in the car?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, let's go.
l want to take you there myself.
lt's not everyday you
get a call like that.
We have contact.
Status?
Standby,
target reduced.
Keep the Patriot and Nessus on standby.
lt came through
The missiles on standby.
Aye.
Hey.
That was way too easy, buddy boy.
You're not much of a cop.
Let her go. Let her go, Cal.
Oh, you're a funny man,
put the gun down.
Put it down or l'll spread her
all over the damn room.
Put it down.
Atta, boy, nice and easy.
Kick it over to me now.
On your knees now, get down on
your knees, that's a good boy.
Just take me and let her go.
Oh, that's just touching.
But you're missing the point.
l want you to feel what l feel,
my pain.
Cal, goddamit, l feel it.
You don't know my pain. But you will.
No.
Now, that's some fireworks.
Oh, god.
Beautiful, huh.
So, those things are going to land.
We got to find cover, now.
Run, get inside.
Michael? Michael?
Michael?
lt's mommy, can you hear me?
Backstairs.
Oh, god, Michael.
Chelsea, Michael, can you hear me?
Chelsea.
