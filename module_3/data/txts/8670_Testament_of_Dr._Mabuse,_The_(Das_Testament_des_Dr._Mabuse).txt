<i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse
premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest.</i>
Originally 124 minutes long,
the film had been banned in Germany.
It wasn't until August 24, 1951,
that the movie was first shown in Germany
in a shortened 111 -minute version.
The original negative of that version
survived at the German Film Institute (DIF)
but was severely damaged.
Therefore, a 1951 duplicate positive
from the collection
of the German Film Institute (DIF)
served as a basis for the restoration.
Whenever possible, missing scenes
from the Federal Film Archive
and the Munich Film Museum
were inserted.
In its present form,
the film runs 121 minutes.
The film was restored
by the German Film Institute (DIF)
in collaboration
with the Federal Film Archive,
the Munich Film Museum,
KirchMedia and ZDF/ARTE.

You know that one, Müller?
<i>That's from Die Walküre.</i>
Those are the girls
who carry dead police inspectors
directly up to heaven from
the Alexanderplatz with a "Hey ho."
On horseback.
Horseback?
Certainly.
Expenses don't allow for a car.
Well, Inspector,
when it comes to corpses,
the state sometimes has...
a fit of generosity.
That's what you think.
Believe it or not, Müller,
tonight will be the first time
I make it to the theater
in time for the first act.
Knock on wood, Inspector.
There. What did I tell you?
Tell 'em I'm dead.
Police headquarters.
Inspector Lohmann's office.
Inspector.
Inspector.
What is it?
Hofmeister would like
to speak with you, Inspector.
What?
Our former colleague who got
into trouble with foreign currency?
That scoundrel?
Tell him his call
is the most shameless affront
I've ever experienced!
And tell him to go to hell!
I'm sorry, but Inspector Lohmann
has already left
and he says you -
And he says you can go to hell!
God help me!
Let me tell you something, Müller.
I once had high hopes
for that fellow Hofmeister.
I gave him his first chance.
And what does the scoundrel do?
He takes a bribe from
a black-market currency trader.
Phooey!
The man I would have
staked my life for
disgraces me
by getting fired from the service
like a bad egg.
Police headquarters.
Inspector Lohmann's office.
He has to hear me out,
for God's sake!
Tell him it's a matter
of life and death.
Inspector, I think
you really ought to -
Of course I'll miss
the first act again!
I want to redeem myself
in his eyes!
I finally figured out their scheme.
It's a monstrous business!
They've nearly done me in three times!
I hardly dare cross the street!
Lohmann speaking.
What is it?
Inspector?
Thank you.
Cut out the nonsense
and tell me what's wrong.
Yes, Inspector.
I've finally discovered -
Just a moment, please.
Just in case, Inspector,
please have a record made
of my report.
Headphones.
Take this down.
I was actually tracing
counterfeit money.
I wanted to redeem myself
in your eyes, Inspector.
For four days - 96 hours -
I lay up there at the air vent,
and now I know who's behind it all.
But you'll probably think I'm crazy.
Who is it?
I swear I'm telling the truth.
I know who's behind it all!
I heard his name with my own ears!
And now they know I know the name.
<i>My God!
The lights have gone out!</i>
<i>Lohmann, help me, for God's sake!</i>
Can you trace that call?
For God's sake! Hofmeister!
What street?
Number 23? Thanks.

<i>Lovely are the maidens in Batavia</i>
Dear God.
He must have gone
out of his mind from terror.
A pathological condition that
is not as rare as one might suspect.
Exposure to catastrophes
such as explosions, earthquakes
and railway accidents -
in short, exposure
to fright and horror
often triggers insanity.
Perhaps the most interesting case
of such pathological conditions
is the case of Dr. Mabuse.
Here he goes again.
I shall briefly recount
the history of this case.
The patient lived
a decidedly double life.
He was a renowned doctor
with a large private practice.
Aided by an almost
superhuman logic,
he used his profound
knowledge of hypnosis
to commit crimes of a magnitude
previously deemed impossible.
For months the police sought
the mastermind behind those crimes,
the man behind the curtain.
At last they discovered
his whereabouts.
But Mabuse decided not to flee
but rather to mount
armed resistance,
and he barricaded himself in his house
with four loyal henchmen.
He refused demands to surrender
to state authorities, saying,
"I am the state!"
A barrage of bullets
forced the police to retreat.
Finally, soldiers stormed the house
with hand grenades.
Two of the defenders were killed.
Two were captured.
Mabuse, however, had disappeared.
One prisoner revealed
his hiding place:
a counterfeiting lab from which
he planned to launch a massive attack
on the German currency system.
The police force their way in
to seize him
only to find he had gone
hopelessly insane.
Judging by his incoherent remarks,
he had seen, during the previous night,
the ghosts of all those he had slain.
Apparently it was the horror
of that experience
that overpowered
this phenomenal mind,
which for so long had straddled
the fine line
between genius and madness,
and literally deranged it.
Mabuse was committed
to an insane asylum
and to this day has not spoken
a word to anyone.
Silent and motionless, he remains
in the position you see here.
The patient withdrew
into his own ego,
depriving us of any glimpse
into his inner life.
But suddenly
the clinical profile changed.
We observed that Mabuse's hand
continuously made writing motions
in the air, on the wall
and on the bedspread.
We gave him pencil and paper.
At first, he covered the paper
with senseless scribbling.
Two years ago, however,
certain words began
to appear on the paper.
Then, sentences began to form,
still meaningless and confused.
Gradually they grew
more coherent and logical,
and at last we began to get glimpses
into the extraordinary
phenomenon that was his mind.
His thoughts still move in the same
criminal channels as before.
Whatever Mabuse writes
is based upon incontrovertible logic
and serves as a perfect guide
for the commission of crimes
worked out to the minutest detail.
No. Nothing can happen to us
if we follow the doctor's methods.
- Oh, yeah?
- What do you mean, "oh, yeah"?
The first attacks on the snitch failed.
So what? Tough luck.
So we called in Division 2-B
to handle the matter.
If they succeed, fine.
And if they don't -
if it looks like that snitch
might rat on us -
one single phone call
and this whole place gets blown sky-high.
Stop scratching, Fritzi.
It won't come to that.
Before that guy
can open his mouth,
he'll be done for.
I'd feel better
if they didn't resort to murder.
What do you mean, murder?
A guy can have something
fall on his head, can't he?
A nice, clean little accident.
I don't care how you make it look.
I just don't want anything
to do with murder.
Scared?
Can't bear the sight of blood?
Let me tell you something,
though it's really none
of your damn business.
I've killed two people.
I know what it means to kill.
And that's precisely why
I want nothing to do with murder.
Leave him alone, Fritzi.
What do you know about Kent?
The phone!
Yeah?
It's been taken care of?
Bravo!
Really?
Just 20 minutes later?
Lohmann himself?
Continue writing.
Hofmeister himself has disappeared.
The rug has been moved
toward the window.
He was on the phone
when the lights went out.
Where's the light switch?
- Here by the door.
So it came from over there,
the unknown horror,
the thing that caused
his mind to snap.
And he backed away
from it step by step,
right up to the window.
I wonder if he -
No, he couldn't get out this way.
Certainly not downward.
Well, I'll be damned!
Actual letters
scratched into the glass with a ring.
So he was trying
to tell me something.
Is that a W?
No.
Could it be a name?
It may take us a while
to figure that one out.
Hey, Krüger.
- Yes, Inspector.
Take this pane of glass
to my office at headquarters.
And see that you don't break it,
or I'll bite your head off.
That's odd.
I wonder what's behind that.
Thirty pages today, Professor.
Thank you.
Keep a careful eye on him tonight.
I don't like his pulse.
In any case, give him a shot later
so he can get some rest.
Yes, Professor.
Their famous chocolate shake?
And a double mocha for you, sir?
- With hot cream.
- As usual. Very well.
And now tell me, Tom.
Why did you ask to see me
so urgently today?
Don't you know what today is, Lilli?
Today?
Too bad.
Won't you tell me?
Certainly.
A chocolate shake
and a double mocha with hot cream.
Well, Tom?
You ask what day this is?
Exactly one year ago today,
<i>at the emp/oyment office -</i>
No smoking, gentlemen.
Smoking is prohibited.
Good heavens, my friend,
are you back again?
I've told you a hundred times
there's no point in coming every day.
When we have work for you,
we'll certainly notify you.
I've been waiting for three months!
Be reasonable.
Reasonable?
What does reasonable mean
when a man is going under?
I want to work!
But they keep pushing me
closer to the edge!
It's enough to drive
a man to crime!
He's forced to become a criminal!
He marches in here
and causes a riot!
Don't get so worked up.
We have others to attend to.
- Come now.
- Leave him alone. He's sick.
- Come now.
- Don't touch me! I'll go on my own!
You'll never see me again here!
- Next, please.
You've seen the last of me!
Just a moment, please.
I can't bear
to see you leave like this.
Here are 20 marks.
It's all I have right now,
but I'd like you to have it.
It may help you out.
I don't want charity.
I want work, not a handout.
It's not a handout.
It's just a loan.
I'm sure you'll be able
to pay me back.
Please.
Yes.
And six months later, you found work
and promptly paid back my 20 marks.
Tell me, Lilli...
have you ever been in love?
It's high time I was going.
Here comes my bus.
- Please stay.
- I can't. I've got to run.
Good-bye, Tom. Call me.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
If you'll be seated, Doctor,
the professor is due back
any moment.
Thanks, Winkler.
I'm sure I'll find what I need.
Ah, I see it's on his desk.
Oops. Oh, dear!
What order does all this go in?
This junk isn't even numbered.
What is this anyway?
NOTES BY DR. MABUSE
SEPTEMBER 1 ST - OCTOBER 31 ST
How does this go together now?
No, the other way around.
Then this page.
What's the next part? "Jewel-"
No.
"Jewel-
- ry store."
"Jewelry store...
specializing in high-quality..."
What?
"The least conspicuous and therefore
most effective precaution
to prevent interruption by police,
pedestrians and clients
is to pull the shades
and hang a sign on the door:
'Closed from 10:00 to 2:00
for inventory."'
Well, I'll be!
"The criminals then lowered the shades
and hung a sign outside the door,
'Closed from 10:00 to 2:00
for inventory."'
If that isn't something!
That's incredible!
"lmmobilize the staff
by using gas in bulbs of thin glass,
which will burst
almost inaudibly when tossed."
Gas! Amazing!
Identical, almost to the word!
"The criminals appear to have tossed
bulbs of thin glass filled with gas."
"Bulbs of thin glass filled with gas."
If that isn't odd!
It's as if they were following
a blueprint!
What are you doing there?
Baum.
This is the most incredible thing
you could imagine.
Look here. What is this?
Where did you get these papers?
Never mind that!
You know what they are?
Yes, of course.
Now read this.
"Ingenious jewelry heist..."
That's right. Read it.
"Jewelry stolen
valued at 250,000 marks.
Gas was used on the employees."
Yes, just as if they were following
your Dr. Mabuse's instructions.
A curious coincidence.
Now wait just a minute.
You call that a coincidence?
- What else?
Baum, old man, coincidences
like that just don't happen.
There's some connection in all this
or I'll eat my hat.
Say, I've got a crazy idea.
Could this Mabuse fellow
be faking it?
Maybe the guy isn't insane after all.
Tell me,
do you think that,
after treating a patient for years,
I can't judge whether he's really sick
or just pretending?
I didn't mean it like that.
But there must be
something behind all this.
You know what a genius
this fellow was.
It's just possible
that his dead brain
has come back to life.
Couldn't Mabuse be writing
these things as a sort of blueprint
for a gang of accomplices?
You've always had a wild imagination.
Just hear me out.
What if Mabuse,
with his incredible hypnotic powers,
engaged in some kind
of telepathic hypnosis
from his cell?
- Nonsense!
- Nonsense?
Say what you like, but there's
something weird going on!
Who else besides you knows
about Mabuse's notes?
You sound just like a policeman.
I think the police should be
informed of this strange coincidence.
- The police?
- Of course!
Well, perhaps -
Of course you're right.
The police would want to know of this.
Of course!
I'll go to them at once.
If I can, I'll call you
from the station.
Good-bye.
Please drive carefully, Doctor.
It's been raining.
- Thank you, Winkler.
- Good-bye.
<i>I do not wish to be disturbed.</i>
Section 2-B.
Yes.
Let me repeat that back:
a small blue DKW,
<i>/icense p/ate 1 A 74259.</i>
Intersection of Grüner Winkel
and Körnerstrasse. We'll take care of it.
Körnerstrasse and Grüner Winkel.

Faster.
Faster or we'll miss him!
INGENIOUS JEWELRY HEIST
STOLEN JEWELRY VALUED
AT 250,000 MARKS
Almost a quarter million in jewels.
Pearls, platinum, gold.
One can do a lot with that.
Can? Could!
But what will be done with it?
What's gonna happen
with that quarter million?
Careful.
I ask you -
Will you stay down?
What becomes of it, I ask you?
We buy cocaine with it,
morphine, heroin, opium,
whatever you call all that crap.
And instead of making
a killing off the dope
and fleecing the types
who are crazy for the stuff,
they practically give it away.
What good does it do the boss
to pump the world full of dope
and not make any money off it?
These things won't stay down.
What does it get him?
I follow his instructions
and drive ten people nearly crazy
with threats and blackmail.
And when they're ready
to pay any sum we ask,
then I'm told to back off
and forget about the money.
Only result is they're driven crazy
from fear of a scandal.
Is that any business of yours, old boy?
Did you ever fail
to get your pay on time?
That's not what I'm saying.
Okay, then.
You handle the blackmail,
and I see to your alibi.
We get our paychecks like clockwork,
so what are you growling about?
I'm not growling.
I just don't get it. If a woman
throws herself out the window,
or a fellow blows his brains out,
like that bank director,
blackmail letters aren't of much use.
150 grand tossed in the gutter.
Is there any sense in that?
Or take the new instructions
about the explosives,
and stealing poison from drugstores -
that's scary business.
As it's meant to be, my dear fellow.
But why, in the devil's name?
I think you ask too many questions.
The boss doesn't like that.
What? You know him?
No more than you do,
or anyone else in our gang.
And I'm not the least bit curious.
I learned my lesson
from your predecessor.
He just had to find out
what the man looked like,
the man behind the curtain,
the boss.
So one day,
without having been summoned,
<i>he snuck into the famous room
with the curtain.</i>
<i>And that's where we found him.</i>
<i>Or rather...</i>
<i>what was /eft of him.</i>
Cut it out, man.
You're spoiling my appetite.
Let me give you a tip.
Let the boss worry about this stuff.
We're well paid.
In fact, very well paid.
If something goes wrong,
we'll have cast-iron alibis
or a top-notch lawyer.
The boss thinks of everything
and takes care of everything
and demands not a penny
for himself of all the loot.
Not a penny.
See? That's just it. Why?
Why doesn't he take
a single penny for himself?
I can't understand that,
and that's what's got me jumpy.
Lots of others in our gang
probably feel the same
and would like to be done
with the whole thing
but just don't know how.
"Dearest Lilli, you dashed off
so quickly this afternoon
that I had no chance to say
what I wanted to tell you. I -"
TONIGHT AT 1:00 A. M. - DR. MABUSE
<i>You say you searched
the furthest precincts</i>
<i>and found no trace of Hofmeister?</i>
<i>His description
was sent to all officers?</i>
Inspector Lohmann asks
if you had the hospitals searched.
A special squad did that, and Hofmeister
hasn't been admitted anywhere?
- Damn it!
- You'll call back?
Wait a minute.
Get a picture of Hofmeister
from the files.
We may need to have
posters printed up.
Now, then, what is your assessment
of the murder in the automobile?
So far, all I know is
that the killer used
a 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol, from 1906,
production of which ended in 1916.
This weapon was fired from a distance
of not more than 25 feet.
No empty shells were found
in the street nor on the sidewalk,
and the bullet's trajectory indicates
the shot was not fired
from a window
but rather from a point
almost level with the victim's head.
We may therefore conclude the shot
was fired from another vehicle.
Another vehicle?
That would be
very interesting indeed.
That opens up
a whole new perspective.
Inspector Lohmann's office.
Not bad.
Excuse me, Inspector.
It's Habermann.
This is about the Kramm homicide.
Inspector, we've traced
the murder victim's actions
up until 6:10 on the evening
of the murder.
Where he was from then
until the time of death
we have not yet
been able to establish.
But that's what we need to find out.
See that you find out
where he was those last two hours.
Very well.
Müller, arrange to have -
No, wait.
Where's the text
for the Kramm homicide poster?
Here it is.
"All information will be kept
confidential" -
Put another line in here:
"Especially concerning the hours
from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m."
Have those changes made.
And - No, never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Photo department.
Weber, the old man
wants to talk to you.
Trouble?
I don't know.
Weber here.
I'm just doing it now.
Enlargements, naturally.
Trace the scratches and see
if you can't link them together
into a word or name or something.
I'm sure Hofmeister intended to -
Inspector, they found Hofmeister!
Where?
The police station
at Schöneberger Ufer.
A police patrol found him.
At first they thought
he was just another drunk
because he kept babbling
to himself incessantly.
But then they heard him
call your name.
Inspector Lohmann.
Why won't you listen to me,
for God's sake?
Inspector, you must listen to me.
It's a matter of life and death.
Inspector Lohmann, please listen,
for the love of God!
<i>G/oria</i>
<i>G/oria</i>
<i>Love/y are the maidens in Batavia</i>
<i>Between 17 and 18</i>
My God!
You see?
The moment he thinks
he's being watched, he starts singing.
When he thinks he's alone,
he calls your name.
I'll leave you alone now.
Hofmeister, don't you recognize me?
Goddamn it!
Hofmeister, it's me, Lohmann.
Your old friend Lohmann.
My God!
Inspector?
Inspector Lohmann?
Why don't you come to the phone?
For God's sake, come to the phone,
Inspector Lohmann.
Come to the phone!
Hello. This is Lohmann.
Detective Inspector Lohmann.
Who is it, please?
Inspector?
Is that you, Hofmeister?
This is Lohmann.
<i>Love/y are the maidens</i>
Hopeless.
We'll have no other choice
but to commit the poor devil
to an institution.
Listen to me, for God's sake!
Why don't you come
to the phone, Inspector?
Poor devil, eh?
Heaven help me if I ever get
my hands on the scoundrel
responsible
for that fellow's condition!
All of a sudden he stopped writing
and just sat there
like a living corpse.
Then he suddenly
got an expression in his eyes,
<i>those eyes that /eave you
practica//y para/yzed!</i>
<i>The eyes of a man who -</i>
If he were in his right mind,
I believe he could compel people
to do his will right from his cell.
The professor must come.
The professor is working
and doesn't wish to be disturbed.
Winkler, this is Mabuse!
- Not so loud!
- The professor will fire me on the spot.
<i>I do not wish to be disturbed.</i>
<i>With great disconcertment
I have found out</i>
<i>that in the Hofmeister matter,</i>
<i>survei//ance at the print shop
fai/ed in the most irresponsib/e way.</i>
<i>Don't interrupt.</i>
<i>I didn't ask for your opinion.</i>
<i>The Hofmeister affair
wou/d have turned into</i>
<i>a catastrophe of the first order</i>
<i>if not for the exce//ent work</i>
<i>of Division 2-B.</i>
<i>I'll come back to that later.</i>
<i>Even so, in the future,</i>
<i>all security measures
protecting our organization</i>
<i>will be made much more stringent.</i>
<i>Anyone constituting a menace
to our organization</i>
<i>is to be e/iminated
without exception.</i>
<i>Kent, it has come
to my ears that you -</i>
<i>perhaps due to something
in your past -</i>
<i>that you do not approve of certain
of my organization's measures.</i>
<i>I'm warning you, Kent -</i>
<i>and I never give
more than one warning -</i>
<i>in the near future
you will have to prove</i>
<i>that you are abso/ute/y
committed to our organization,</i>
<i>and that you know
what you are being paid for.</i>
MURDER - 2,000 MARKS REWARD
Murder.
No!
It's really none of my business,
but I don't think you're taking
the doctor's warning seriously enough.
Oh, yes, I am. Division 2-B.
No one in the organization
gets out of it alive.
It's hopeless.
<i>There's no turning back.</i>
"I must say farewell forever,
and I can't even tell you why.
But there's no other way for me
to behave decently towards you.
You will never know what you've
meant in my botched life.
It is very difficult
to say good-bye to you, Lilli."
"Forget me -
though I shall never forget you!"
It spells Mabuse.
What spells Mabuse?
Those scratches
on the windowpane, Inspector.
It took me forever to discover
he was writing as if in a mirror.
Using his left hand,
and behind his back.
If you flip it over, see there?
Quite clear.
Wasn't he that -
<i>That doctor back
during the economic crisis?</i>
Quite right. Inspector.
I've got him. 1920 - 1921.
Dr. Mabuse "The Gambler."
Come on, let me see that.
Let's see what business he has
being on that windowpane.
<i>When Lohmann
has untied all the knots,</i>
then you may sweep up
as much as you like.
But until then, he'll go wild as an ape
if you touch anything, and he bites.
I'd like to see him try.
<i>Mü//er.</i>
The old man's coming.
Get out!
Müller, come here.
Call up G9-19-902.
That's the mental hospital
run by Professor Baum
where they committed
a certain Dr. Mabuse.
I'd like to know if he's still there.
When?
Thank you.
Dr. Mabuse died this morning.
This morning?
Today of all days.
That is quite peculiar.
TONIGHT AT 12:00 - DR. MABUSE
So, you too?
What do you mean, me too?
Something big is on
for tonight, it seems.
We've been called in,
as have Divisions 5 and 9...
as well as Section 2-B.
- Good Lord.
- It's no use, Kent.
The doctor is more powerful than you.
Is your curiosity satisfied now,
Inspector?
And this corpse
is clearly identified as Mabuse?
There's no doubt of that?
Unfortunately not, Inspector.
Unfortunately
it is only too certain
that this dead man here
is Dr. Mabuse.
Or was.
Alas.
This assessment of the deceased -
Is smoking permitted here?
- Yes.
seems to me to be slightly,
let's say -
Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.
let's say slightly exaggerated.
In the case of Dr. Mabuse, we're not
dealing with a human being of value
but with an evil criminal
who only escaped the gallows
by entering an insane asylum.
One less insane criminal
in the world.
Silence! You have no idea.
No one has any idea
what kind of phenomenal,
superhuman mind
has come to an end
with Dr. Mabuse's death.
This mind would have laid waste
to our whole rotten world,
which is long overdue
for destruction.
This godless world,
devoid of justice and compassion,
consisting only of selfishness,
cruelty and hatred.
This mind would have
destroyed mankind,
which itself knows
only destruction and extermination
and which could only have been
saved in its final hour
through terror and horror.
Mabuse the criminal?
Mabuse the genius!
His intellectual legacy
would have turned
your world, with its police protection,
on its head!
His legacy?
You speak of Mabuse's legacy?
No. Yes.
Of course, not a testament
in the accepted sense of the word.
Just some of his notes,
of interest only to physicians
and men of science.
I'm afraid, Professor,
that you underestimate
the number of subjects
in which I take an interest.
Take, for example, a case
which concerns me intimately.
Wasn't a young man admitted
to your institution earlier today
by the name of Hofmeister?
May I see that man?
I'm terribly sorry, Inspector.
That man seems to be suffering
the effects of some frightful experience
that he relives each time
someone approaches him.
Then he begins singing
like a frightened child sings in the dark.
I must therefore request,
for the good of the patient,
that you refrain from seeing him now.
What is it?
Forgive me, Professor.
We only wanted to -
They're waiting for you
in anatomy class.
Yes, of course.
Well, I see the doctor's cell
is already occupied again.
Yes, the new one
who arrived last night.
The professor ordered
that he be isolated.
The doctor's cell just became vacant,
so we put him in it.
It's strange
when you come to think of it.
For 10 years I've cared
for the doctor,
and now he lies down there
in the morgue.
Or what's left of him.
TONIGHT AT 12:00 - DR. MABUSE
The doctor.
Division 5 to the boss.
NOTES BY DR. MABUSE
FEBRUARY 15TH TO MARCH 31 ST
"The Empire of Crime."
The empire of crime.
"Humanity's soul must be shaken
to its very depths,
frightened by unfathomable
and seemingly senseless crimes.
Crimes that benefit no one,
whose only objective
is to inspire fear and terror."
<i>Because the ultimate purpose of crime</i>
<i>is to establish
the endless empire of crime.</i>
<i>A state of complete
insecurity and anarchy,</i>
founded upon the tainted ideals
of a world doomed to annihilation.
When humanity,
subjugated by the terror of crime,
has been driven insane
by fear and horror,
and when chaos has become
supreme law,
then the time will have come
for the empire of crime.
ATTACKS UPON RAILROAD LINES,
GAS STORAGE TANKS,
CHEMICAL FACTORIES
<i>You have the specia/ maps
for the northern area?</i>
Yes, sir.
<i>The fire in the chemica/ factory</i>
<i>in quadrants E-9 and K-14 -</i>
<i>Repeat that.</i>
"Quadrants E-9 and K-14."
<i>They are to be concentrated</i>
<i>so as to spread the b/aze main/y
to the storerooms and depots.</i>
<i>/s that c/ear?
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>By the time the fire crews arrive,</i>
<i>the flames must be
impossib/e to subdue.</i>
Division 3 and Dr. Hauser
to the boss.
ACTIONS AGAINST
BANKS AND CURRENCY
<i>- Division 3?
- Yes.</i>
And Dr. Hauser.
<i>Report.</i>
Per my orders,
the letters incriminating
the signatory of the Overseas Bank
were not returned to him,
even when very large sums
were offered,
until he agreed to comply
completely with our demands.
We are now in possession
of duplicate keys
to every one of the bank's vaults,
as well as combinations
to all the safes
and plans for all alarm systems.
Only after successful completion of
our mission will the letters be returned.
<i>Good.</i>
<i>Turn the materia/ over to Division 3
and wait downstairs.</i>
<i>I'll need you later.
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Division 3,</i>
<i>you are to bund/e the comp/eted
counterfeit bi//s this morning</i>
<i>and affix the stamps
of the Overseas Bank.</i>
<i>Per the instructions
you have just received,</i>
<i>at exact/y 11:00 tomorrow night</i>
<i>you will break into the bank</i>
<i>and rep/ace the bi//s
now deposited in the bank</i>
<i>with the counterfeit bi//s</i>
<i>so that the bank itself
will distribute the counterfeit money.</i>
<i>The bank guards are to be ki//ed.</i>
<i>Ki//ed!</i>
<i>There mustn't be the s/ightest c/ue
to suggest the safes were opened.</i>
<i>Once everything has been
executed according to p/an,</i>
<i>the bank's a/arms must be set off</i>
<i>to simu/ate a burg/ary
interrupted in progress.</i>
<i>Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.</i>
<i>Division 3 is no /onger needed.</i>
I LOVE YOU!
Good evening, Tom.
I was here in the afternoon, too,
but you weren't home.
Nor were you here
earlier this evening.
So I waited, Tom,
a terribly long time.
Won't you at least offer me
a seat in return, Tom?
What a lovely place
you have here.
I like rooms that have
such wide, tall windows.
Lovely.
Is this true?
Yes, Tom.
But I wrote to you!
And I gave you my answer, Tom.
But you don't even know
who I am, Lilli.
My dear Tom,
isn't that entirely beside the point?
Beside the point?
Entirely beside the point!
We'll see right now
whether it's beside the point!
There you have it, in black and white -
just who I am.
Official confirmation
with the seal and signature
of the prison director
and everything that goes with it.
- Prison.
- Yes, prison!
Four and a half years in prison!
The last six months commuted
for good behavior.
There.
Why should I care, Tom?
I love you.
You don't know why I was in prison.
I killed two people.
One was my girlfriend,
and the other was the man
I'd thought was my best friend.
Why should I care, Tom?
I love you.
Then I'm forced
to tell you the rest, Lilli.
I...
I lied to you, Lilli!
I told you
I'd found a position, didn't I?
Well, I certainly did.
Do you know where?
In a counterfeiting lab.
That's one place that can use
an engineer who's an ex-con.
If I had only known
what I know now.
<i>A/ong with destruction of the crops,</i>
<i>water supp/ies must be poisoned.</i>
<i>Epidemics of every kind
must break down</i>
<i>any resistance on the part
of the peop/e.</i>
<i>A warning to unreliable elements
will not be issued again.</i>
<i>The s/ightest sign of treachery</i>
<i>will be punished
immediately by death.</i>
You see, Lilli?
This time you don't say,
"Why should I care, Tom? I love you."
Look, Tom.
When I received your letter,
did you really think me so dense
that I wouldn't sense
the despair in your heart?
I thought to myself,
"What he needs
is to regain his faith in himself,
to believe that everything
can turn out well again."
And I thought to myself,
"Maybe you can restore
his faith in himself
if you tell him how much
you care for him
and that you will stand by him
for better or for worse."
And so I came to you.
Tell me,
have you taken it upon yourself
to rob me of my last shred of sanity?
Yes, Tom.
You! You!
You have to report
that he's failed to show up.
Let's wait.
Finished.
I guess I have no other choice.
Section 2-B? Yes.
This is Division 3.
I must report that Kent
didn't show up.
Believe me, Tom,
your life is just beginning.
A brand-new life,
clean, spotless and good.
It's true, Tom!
We'll put it all behind us
and make a fresh start.
And you know who'll help us?
Help us?
Yes, Tom.
The man who once -
When he had to arrest you,
he was so decent
and compassionate towards you.
Lohmann?
Inspector.
What is it?
Voberg is here.
He claims to have
some important news.
Give me a cigar and raise the shades.
Then show him in.
Morning, Inspector.
What is it?
Well, Inspector, it's like this.
Scholz and I think
we've stumbled across something -
Lower those shades.
Clumsy fool.
We stumbled across something that
might lead us to the jewelry robbers.
Is that so?
We saw a girl running around
with a big pearl necklace.
She could tell me anything at all,
that she bought the thing
at Woolworth's for 25 pfennigs.
But Scholz knows about these things,
and he swears
that necklace is genuine.
Well, is it?
So far all we know is that
she's the sweetheart of a scoundrel
who's an expert on anything
having to do with jewelry robberies.
Where are the others?
They had a few details
to take care of.
Come along, quietly.
Come along, Kent.
Come on, let's go!
Off you go, then, but remember:
Be careful.
You're dealing with
a dangerous international crook.
Understand?
- Yes, Inspector.
All right then. Good luck.
Good day, Chief.
<i>Kent!</i>
<i>You were ordered to prepare
the strike against the Overseas Bank.</i>
<i>You fai/ed to carry out your orders.</i>
<i>Fai/ure to obey
is tantamount to treason.</i>
<i>The pena/ty
for both offenses is death.</i>
Let the woman go free.
Do with me what you like,
but let her go free.
<i>You and that woman</i>
<i>will never leave this room alive.</i>
You monster!
- Tom, for God's sake!
- Stay back!
Good God!
<i>You will never leave
this room alive.</i>
<i>You have three hours /eft to /ive.</i>
What's that?
Tom, what's that?
What's that, Tom?
Whatever it is, Lilli,
we must find it
and put an end to it.
<i>You'll be taking over
Kent's job, by the way.</i>
He won't be able to do it anymore.
What do you mean?
He's otherwise engaged.
Who could that be?
How do I know?
Maybe it's the mailman.
Anni!
Wanna go and see who that is?
Hold on.
Who is it?
The gas man.
I'd like to inspect the meter.
Afternoon, miss.
You want to look at the meter?
Come back some other time.
I've got company right now.
How dare you!
- Police. Open up.
Look out! Police!
- Don't shoot!
- Shut up, you idiot!
Get out!
Quick, out the back door!
We don't have one!
You idiots get an apartment
with only one exit?
- What about the window?
- From the fourth floor?
There must be some way out!
Shall I put in
an elevator for you guys?
Now we're really done for!
That guy will call
all his cop friends.
And on a Sunday, too.
What're you crying about?
It's your own damn fault
for firing at him!
Leave me alone, you hear?
Stop giving me a hard time!
Listen, try to knock a hole
through the ceiling.
Maybe we can escape to the roof.
I'll try to hit the guy
and keep him back from the door!
Stay back.
Notify the Special Tactics Squad
and get hold of -
Damned scoundrel!
Who should I get hold of?
Homicide.
Inspector Lohmann.
It's no use.
We'll never get out this way.
The window, Tom.
We could try to break through that.
Cement.
But the brick, maybe.
Damn it!
Hey! How far are you in there?
I can't hold this door forever.
Lohmann and his whole gang are here.
Lohmann?
That's it! I'm out!
Get yourself killed, all of you!
What do you mean by that?
What do I mean?
I'll tell you what I mean!
Watch the door!
Out of the way.
Hardy, be sensible. It's no use.
We won't get anywhere
on the roof.
Let me talk to them.
Let me tell you something.
Anyone who gets near that door,
inside or out,
is gonna get it, understand?
Go keep an eye on them!
Move it!
Almost.
Now.
Let's see now.
What's the matter, Tom?
It's no use, Lilli.
Behind those bricks is a steel plate.
Dear God!
Careful!
A bullet can cripple you for life!
Is he dead?
Karetzky.
Goddamn this mess!
Anni, get some towels.
Come on, quick!
It's no use.
Better keep an eye on the door.
- Why didn't you let me negotiate?
- You and your stupid shooting!
Bredow, shoot anyone
who comes near the door!
Do you hear?
- You bet I will!
I've had enough of this business.
I've got you now.
Open up! It's Lohmann!
What's the matter?
Lohmann's outside.
- I forbid you to go!
- Who are you to forbid anything?
I won't land in jail 'cause of you!
Think I'll let you cowardly swine
send me to the slaughter?
Be sensible.
It's no use.
We've got hand grenades.
I'll give you one last chance.
If you're reasonable,
we'll be reasonable too.
That's the way.
Attaboy. Daddy's proud of you.
Now, open the door
and put your hands up.
- How many of you are there?
- Five, Inspector.
One, two, three.
Diamond Anna!
See you don't catch a cold, my dear.
Four.
Where's the fifth?
Damn it!
Don't try anything!
A Dreyse pistol.
What do you know?
A Dreyse pistol, no less.
Made in 1906, 7.65-mm.
Apparently the former owner -
a friend of yours -
- No.
- No?
That's funny.
It says here that the two of you
were close friends.
It's signed by Karetzky, Diamond Anna,
and her sweetheart.
One shouldn't forsake
a friend who's died.
I'm not forsaking him.
That's more like it.
So your old buddy held on to this gun
because he was used to it.
Actually,
haven't these things been
out of style for a long time?
I'm no gun expert.
That's right.
You're more of an expert
on automobiles.
What make of car
did Dr. Kramm drive?
A "Hanomag" or a DKW?
Who?
Dr. Kramm, the guy you two
rubbed out from your car.
I don't know
what you're talking about, Inspector.
Is that so? Müller.
It's no good, Lilli.
I can't find a thing.
God almighty.
There, there.
Steady, Lilli.
My dear little Lilli.
There might be another way.
It's a long shot.
- What if we flood the room with water?
- Water?
Yes. Where did I -
- What are you looking for, Tom?
- My knife.
Water lessens the force of an explosion.
- There it is.
Out of the way.
It just might break
through the wall for us.
What if it doesn't, Tom?
If the water rises, and we're -
Let's try it, Tom.
- Here you are, Inspector.
- Thank you.
So you don't know anything
about Dr. Kramm's murder?
No, Inspector. The first I heard of it
was right here.
Let me show you something.
Come here.
Come, come.
Take a look at this still life.
You're familiar with this here.
A 7.65-mm Dreyse pistol
made in 1906.
It belonged to your friend.
He shot himself with it, didn't he?
Yes.
Fine.
But do you know
what's in there?
No.
Well, then, look here.
Take that magnifying glass
and take a careful look
at these two Easter eggs.
Well?
See any difference?
No, not the slightest.
You see, my boy, that's just it!
None of us police could detect
any difference either,
neither with the magnifying glass
nor in the photographs.
These two bullets are
so completely identical
that they could only have
been fired from the same gun.
Yet one was taken from the skull
of the deceased Dr. Kramm,
and the other was found in the skull
of your dead friend Hardy.
Glass of water, my lad?
- Cigarette.
So now tell me why your friend Hardy
shot and killed Dr. Kramm.
- I can't tell you that, Inspector.
- Liar!
Kill me if you like, but I don't know
what Hardy's orders were!
- So you had orders?
- Not me. Hardy.
From whom?
I couldn't tell you, Inspector.
I've never seen the man in my life.
Now enters the mystery man.
Come on in and pull up a chair.
Just what we needed:
the man in the shadows.
So you don't know the man's name?
On my honor, Inspector,
I don't know who gave Hardy those orders.
Then there's nothing we can do.
Dictate for the record
what you know about the whole case.
Yes, Inspector.
- Müller.
- Yes, Inspector.
It was like this,
Mr. Assistant Inspector.
I was just -
I was just washing my car,
because everything has to be in top shape
in these days of keen competition.
Suddenly the phone rings,
and Hardy picks it up.
Then he came and said we were
to catch up with Dr. Kramm's car
at the intersection of Körnerstrasse
and Grüner Winkel.
So we set out, of course,
and pretty soon he showed up.
Sergeant, take this man away.
Isn't Professor Baum's insane asylum
on Grüner Winkel?
Yes, Inspector.
So that's where Dr. Kramm
spent his final two hours.
Look and see if we have
any police record for Dr. Baum.
Baum - Bertha, Anna, Ulrich, Max.
Nothing on him?
Well, that was -
Thank you.
Get Professor Baum
on the phone for me.
Professor, it's police headquarters.
Inspector Lohmann
wishes to speak to you.
This is Professor Baum.
This man swears you've been
treating him for the last two months.
I think he's just trying
to establish an alibi.
I'd like to confront him with you.
Without him knowing
who you are, of course.
Could you come over right away?
Thanks a million, Professor.
If I'm on the right track now,
I'm gonna get high as a kite tonight!
That's our way out!
We're saved!
Inspector, when are you going
to let me out of this monkey cage?
My dear fellow,
we're glad we've got you in there.
But I've told you everything I know.
We'll see about that.
Professor, please.
Well, Professor,
do you know that man?
Is he the one?
No, Inspector.
I've definitely never seen him before.
Just as I thought.
You there.
Then I've troubled you for nothing.
Professor.
Sorry to disturb you, Inspector,
but we need your signature here.
I'll be right with you.
Pardon me a moment, Professor.
Perhaps you might wait
in my office.
Room 204, at the end of the hall.
- Thanks.
- Any of you know that man?
- No, Inspector.
- No.
- Never seen him before.
Bredow, do you know the man
you just saw with me?
No, Inspector.
I don't know the gentleman.
- Not the slightest doubt?
- No.
MURDER - 2,000 MARKS REWARD
Sad business, isn't it?
Especially for you, since you were
a close friend of the victim.
Yes, we were on excellent terms
as colleagues.
The poor fellow even visited you
on the day of his death.
You could have saved us
a lot of work, Professor,
if you'd reported that to the police.
INFORMATION OF ANY KIND
ESPECIALLY CONCERNING THE HOURS
FROM 6:00 TO 8:00 P. M.
This request was published
in every newspaper
and posted on kiosks
all over the city.
I never read newspapers,
only medical literature.
And today's the first time
I've been in town in four weeks.
Dr. Kramm came to look something up
in a scientific book in my library.
He left in the best of spirits.
As for his death, it's as much
a mystery to me as it is to you.
Then I'm terribly sorry
to have troubled you for nothing.
Why, it's Kent!
Do you know him?
Who?
Him.
I asked you if you knew him.
Where would I know him from?
I have no idea,
yet you just spoke his name.
I did?
That was you, Inspector.
Inspector, I must speak to you.
It's terribly urgent.
I suppose I may leave, Inspector?
My time is -
Of course.
By all means, Professor.
Just a moment, Kent.
Many thanks for coming.
Don't mention it. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
- Inspector, please -
- Just a moment.
Go on in.
It's all right.
- It's tremendously important -
- Just a moment.
This is crucial:
Do you know that man who just left?
- No.
- Are you certain?
I'm certain.
Yet I could swear he knew you.
Most certainly not.
I've never seen him before.
Damn it!
What happened to you,
for God's sake?
That's why we've come.
And what is the name
of this "boss" you mention?
Dr. Mabuse.
Goddamn it!
Mabuse again!
That fellow is dead!
He's alive and kicking, I tell you.
I saw the cadaver myself.
Bless you.
It's true.
- I'm telling you, he's not dead.
I think the two of us
are living proof of that,
though as for "living,"
that was pure luck!
Inspector, I put myself
completely in your hands.
Last night...
I could have fled but I didn't,
because I realized this is
about more than my life or liberty.
My God, how can I convince you?
Is this proof enough for you?
TONIGHT AT 12:00 - DR. MABUSE
Typewritten.
That's no proof.
Someone else could have -
"Someone else"?
I'm not in for anybody.
No exceptions.
Yes, Professor.
All the evidence leads again and again
to that insane asylum.
Müller, get the car.
I may be putting my neck on the line,
but I'm going out there once more,
and you're going with me, Kent.
Perhaps you're right and
<i>Mabuse is still alive.</i>
<i>- I'd like to speak with Professor Baum.
- I'm afraid that's impossible.</i>
<i>The professor can see no one.</i>
<i>Just tell him that Police Inspector
Lohmann wishes to see him.</i>
Gentlemen, it's really impossible.
The professor gave strict orders
not to disturb him.
My good man, I must speak with him.
Now go on and announce me.
- But, Inspector -
- Will you announce me or not?
- I have strict instructions -
- Fine. Don't announce me.
But, Inspector -
<i>I do not wish to be disturbed.</i>
- That's him! That's his voice!
- What?
That's the boss's voice.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
That's the man!
Where is the man
whose voice we just heard?
Kent, come over here.
What is it?
<i>I do not wish to be disturbed.</i>
<i>I clearly said
I did not wish to be disturbed.</i>
That's his voice.
Nice little contraption.
Very clever.
No wonder you failed
to recognize the man's voice.
You only heard
a mechanical reproduction of it.
- The professor?
- Baum. Of course.
But where is he hiding?
What's this?
A map of the northern part of town?
That must be the Löhr & Stegerwald
chemical factory.
CHEMICAL PLANT - OCTOBER 15TH
And today's date.
Strange.
Very strange.
What's one to make of that?
There's something else here.
It's in pencil.
8:30 p.m., and today's date.
It's now 9:10.
Kent, call the chemical plant.
There won't be anyone there,
but they must have guards.
And here's something else.
"Notes by Dr. Mabuse"?
Isn't that interesting.
Go ahead.
Good Lord!
The chemical factory!
"Fires started in this manner
in a chemical factory's storerooms
cannot be extinguished by firefighters.
Tanks exploding from the heat
will quickly release immense quantities
of poisonous gas
into surrounding areas of the city."
Damn it! They're playing cards again
instead of keeping guard.
Here's your line, Inspector.
Police headquarters?
Inspector Lohmann.
- Lohmann, look!
- What?
In the light there!
Quiet.
Over there!
- Nothing.
- Damn it!
There.
Krause!
Where's my driver? Krause!
Where is that guy? Krause!
I'll drive, Inspector.
Push that car out of the way.
I just hope this piece of junk
can make it.
Faster, faster!
Come on!
CAUTION - RAILROAD CROSSING
Get out of the way!
Faster! Come on!
Now we're done for.
Get the spare.
<i>The empire of crime...</i>
<i>The empire of crime...</i>
<i>G/oria</i>
<i>Love/y are the maidens in Batavia</i>
Permit me to introduce myself.
My name is Mabuse.
Dr. Mabuse.
For heaven's sake!
Who opened that door?
Run and get help! He'll kill him!
Police.
We're looking for -
Hofmeister!
Inspector!
That man's name is Mabuse.
Come, my boy.
There's nothing left to do here
for a mere police inspector.
