What we know about him?
He is dedicated to the service.
Fuck me, Cape

You'll be under the command of
Second Lieutenant Martinez.
He was promoted so we have to obey.

Let it seriously.
That's what he said.
Because of him killing two of us.
No way.
So they say. His brother died.

Do not.
Appear to be serious.
Experience tells me that serious

Before the coup it slows down.
The objects in question fall into
ocean for groups
10 miles from the center of a
large town.
Telescope's infrared images
Hubble shows ..

That's funny.
First division, the helicopter.
Heard that the sergeant now
fill the post of Sergeant Becker.
We are lucky to be with us.
The situation is like this:
We were sitting in front of an unknown enemy.
We do not know how hard it is and that is capable of.
What we know is that we fight

Lincoln to the ocean.
At 19:30 not a minute later
Damn.
Firing Santa Monica, sir?
We do not know against who we face,
but surely not of this planet.
And we must give all we have.
And we must give strong
The enemy has only one way.
It has no planes.
We will give the second hole
and take control.
Do I say the majority of civilians?
Likewise.
A group sent a signal.
I picked up from Santa Monica to Olimpico.
Picolo Olimpico you up.
Lieutenant Martinez, you take a
division and machine guns.
Here from the east of Lincoln.

The station was defeated politician.
Signs that there are still civilians.
But we do not know how.
Take survivors
and send helicopters.
Do not forget, they have 3 hours to
start of the bombing.
No doubt, it starts with you or without you.
Find people and get out of there.
Kill, kill everything that is not
