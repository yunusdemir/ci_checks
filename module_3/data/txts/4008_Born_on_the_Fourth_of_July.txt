IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
SOMETIMES I CAN STILL
HEAR THEIR VOICES
ACROSS SALLY'S WOODS.
THERE WAS BILLY, STEVE, TOMMY,
AND THE TALL KID FROM
DOWN THE STREET... JOEY.
YEAH, IT WAS JOEY WALSH.
MY BEST FRIEND WAS TIMMY BURNS
WHO LIVED TWO BLOCKS
AWAY FROM ME.
WE TURNED THE WOODS
INTO A BATTLEFIELD
AND DREAMED THAT SOMEDAY
WE WOULD BECOME MEN.
DID YOU HEAR IT?
WHAT?
LET'S GO, TIMMY!
LET'S GO!
COME ON, MAJOR!
THEY'VE GOT TO BE
SOMEWHERE, RONNIE.
WATCH OUT.
YOU'VE GOT TO STAY
IN THE RAVINE.
SHH.
SHH.
GO! GO! GO!
LOOK, THERE THEY ARE!
WIPE THEM OUT!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
AAH!
YOU'RE DEAD, AND YOU KNOW IT!
NO, I'M NOT!
RONNIE'S DEAD!
NO, I'M NOT!
NO, I'M NOT!
LOOK AT THE MAYOR.
I WONDER WHERE YOUR MOM IS.
WHERE IS THAT WOMAN?
HEY!

STEVIE BOYER
JUST GAVE MARY BARNETT A RING.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
OVER THERE.
O.K.
COME HERE, COME HERE.
WHAT IS THIS?
IS THIS A FIRECRACKER?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
HEY!
HEY!
THIS IS BORING.
YEAH, SQUARE, MAN.
LOOK, DADDY, THE SOLDIERS!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, RONNIE KOVIC.
FOR ME?
YES. OPEN IT.
THAT'S REALLY NICE, DONNA.
SAY THANK YOU, RONNIE.
THANKS, DONNA, BUT
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.
GOING TO THE WOODS TONIGHT?
THEY'LL HAVE FIREWORKS THERE.
SHOULD BE A REAL BLAST.
YEAH, O.K.
WHAT IS IT?
OPEN IT.
LEAVE HIM ALONE.
BEAUTIFUL.
HEY, IT'S
THE REAL THING, RONNIE.
FEEL THAT.
JUST LIKE MICKEY MANTLE, RONNIE.
AIN'T HE
A 4TH OF JULY FIRECRACKER
IN THAT HAT?
YEAH. HE'S MY LITTLE
YANKEE DOODLE BOY.
HEY, GET IT!
GET IT!
COME ON!
LET'S GO!
DID YOU LIKE IT?
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.
HEY, LOOK HOW MANY
PUSHUPS I CAN DO.
WOW! YEAH!
YEAH!
COME ON, RONNIE!
GO, RONNIE, GO!
GO, RONNIE!
YOU CAN DO IT!
GO!
YES!
YES! THAT'S MY BOY!
THAT'S MY BOY!
YES!
RONNIE, YOU MADE IT!
YEAH, ALL RIGHT!
TOMMY! RONNIE!
COME ON!
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS IT!
MICHELLE! BARBARA!
YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS!
NOT AS A CALL TO BEAR ARMS,
THOUGH ARMS WE NEED,
BUT A CALL TO BEAR THE BURDEN
OF A LONG TWILIGHT STRUGGLE,
A STRUGGLE AGAINST
THE COMMON ENEMIES OF MAN...
TYRANNY, POVERTY,
DISEASE, AND WAR ITSELF.
YOU'LL GET A LICKING
IF YOU'RE LATE!
IN THE LONG HISTORY
OF THE WORLD,
ONLY A FEW GENERATIONS
HAVE BEEN GRANTED THE ROLE
OF DEFENDING FREEDOM...
LOOK, PRESIDENT KENNEDY, DADDY.
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S SO HANDSOME.
I DO NOT SHRINK
FROM THIS RESPONSIBILITY,
I WELCOME IT.
LET THE WORD GO FORTH
FROM THIS TIME AND PLACE
THAT THE TORCH HAS BEEN PASSED
TO A NEW GENERATION OF AMERICANS
BORN IN THIS CENTURY.
LET EVERY NATION KNOW
THAT WE SHALL PAY ANY PRICE,
BEAR ANY BURDEN,
SUPPORT ANY FRIEND,
OPPOSE ANY FOE
TO ASSURE THE SURVIVAL
AND THE SUCCESS OF LIBERTY.
I HAD A DREAM, RONNIE,
THE OTHER NIGHT,
AND YOU WERE SPEAKING
TO A LARGE CROWD
JUST LIKE HIM.
JUST LIKE HIM.
AND YOU WERE SAYING
GREAT THINGS.
AND SO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
ASK NOT WHAT YOUR COUNTRY
CAN DO FOR YOU,
ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO
FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
RIGHT! RIGHT UP!
GET OUT!
GOT TO GET OUT!
YOU GOT TO GET OUT!
YOU GOT TO GET OUT!
HIT THAT SWITCH!
HIT THE SWITCH!
ALL RIGHT, HIT THE ROPES!
GO, GO, GO!
HAND OVER HAND OVER HAND!
GET THOSE LEGS OFF THOSE ROPES!
COME ON, LADIES,
LET'S COME DOWN!
LET'S COME DOWN!
THAT ROPE IS LIKE LIFE!
YOU GRAB IT
AND HANG ONTO IT! NEXT!
I WANT YOU TO KILL!
YOU HEAR ME?
YES, SIR!
KILL!
I WANT THAT
CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP!
DO YOU WANT THAT CONFERENCE
CHAMPIONSHIP?
YES, SIR!
GET UP! HEADS!
GET THEM UP!
DO YOU HEAR ME?
GET YOUR HEADS UP, LADIES!
GET YOUR HEADS UP!
I WANT THAT
CONFERENCE CHAMPIONSHIP!
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,
YOU GOT TO SUFFER!
YOU WANT TO BE THE BEST?
YOU GOT TO PAY THE PRICE
FOR VICTORY,
AND THE PRICE IS SACRIFICE!
SUSANNE, NO HOMEWORK
AT THE TABLE, PLEASE.
NO, TOMMY.
AFTER SUPPER.
DAD?
YEAH?
CAN I COME WITH YOU?
THERE'S THE NEXT
CONFERENCE CHAMPION.
SORRY I'M LATE, MA.
THERE'S RICE ON THE STOVE
AND FRUIT IN THE ICEBOX.
I CAN'T.
IT'S ON YOUR DIET, RIGHT?
I GOT TO DROP 3 POUNDS
BY SATURDAY.
YOUR BROTHER'S
A HARD WORKER, TOMMY,
'CAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE BEST.
WIN OR LOSE... IN SCHOOL,
IN SPORTS, IN LIFE...
AS LONG AS YOU DO YOUR BEST,
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO GOD.
WIN OR LOSE, WE STILL LOVE HIM.
CAN I GO TO MY ROOM?
YEAH, SURE.
THANK YOU, GOD, FOR THIS FOOD.
IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER,
THE SON, THE HOLY GHOST, AMEN.
DADDY, JIMMY TOOK MY DOLL!
I'LL GET THE DOLL.
I HATE HIS GUTS!
JUST GO TO BED.
I DIDN'T TAKE ANYTHING!
WHERE'S YOUR SISTER'S DOLL?
JACKIE? WHY
IS JACKIE NOT IN BED?
RONNIE.
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?
WHY ARE YOU IN MY ROOM?
DON'T CHANGE THE SUBJECT.
I DON'T ALLOW PLAYBOY MAGAZINE
IN THIS HOUSE.
STEVIE GAVE IT TO ME.
YOU HAVE FILTHY,
IMPURE THOUGHTS!
GOD'S GOING TO PUNISH YOU.
I HAVEN'T EVEN LOOKED
AT IT YET, ALL RIGHT?
GO TO CONFESSION. I WANT YOU
TO TELL FATHER MCKENNA.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
THIS FILTHY MAGAZINE
IN MY HOUSE AGAIN.
NOW, TAKE THIS AWAY!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
NOTHING.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOTHING?
NOTHING, DAD. O.K.?
YOU'RE OUT OF BOUNDS, GUYS.
BACK INSIDE.
COME ON, KOVIC, BACK INSIDE.
COME ON, KOVIC.
GO, RONNIE.
KOVIC, BACK INSIDE.
COME ON, KOVIC.
BACK INSIDE.
LET'S GO.
I WANT TO SEE SOME EXPLOSION!
COME ON, RONNIE!
NO MESSING AROUND!
YOU'RE GREAT, RONNIE!
YOU'RE GREAT, RONNIE!
STAY WITH HIM!
COME ON DOWN!
ALL RIGHT!
O.K. GET OFF
THE MAT.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET...
GET HIM! GET HIM!
GET HIM! GET HIM!
REVERSAL.
2 POINTS!
ALL RIGHT!
OH, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES!
OHH, YOU!

YOU'RE BOTH UP.
ALL RIGHT, FRESH START.
FRESH START.
STAND UP.
DON'T LET HIM GET YOU!
DON'T LET HIM GET YOU!
PULL HIM OUT!
ALL RIGHT!
WATCH THOSE LEGS.
WATCH HIM!
GET HIM DOWN!
DON'T LET HIM GET THE NECK!
NO! NO!
NO!
YOU CAN BEAT HIM, RONNIE!
COME ON! COME ON!
COME ON!
RONNIE, RONNIE, RONNIE!
BRIDGE! BRIDGE!
YOU CAN WIN!
DON'T GIVE UP!
AAH!
OH, NO!
O.K., SON?
OH, NO.
COME ON, GET UP.
ATTENTION!
FORWARD MARCH!
LEFT, LEFT.
LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT.
SEATS!
GOOD MORNING.
I AM GUNNERY SERGEANT HAYES.
THIS IS SERGEANT BOWERS.
UNITED STATES MARINE RECRUITING STATION,
LEVITTOWN, NEW YORK.
WE ARE HERE TODAY
AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR PRINCIPAL
MR. RICHARDS
AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY
TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT
ABOUT THE MARINE CORPS.
FIRST OFF, YOUNG MEN,
LET'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT.
NOT EVERYBODY BECOMES
UNITED STATES MARINES.
WE WANT THE BEST,
AND WE'LL ACCEPT NOTHING
BUT THE BEST,
BECAUSE THERE
IS NOTHING PROUDER,
NOTHING FINER, NOTHING
STANDING AS STRAIGHT
AS A UNITED STATES MARINE.
NOW, THEY'VE GOT THE ARMY.
THEY GOT THE NAVY.
THEY GOT THE AIR FARCE.
AND IF YOU WANT TO JOIN THEM,
BE MY GUEST.
BUT IF YOU WANT A CHALLENGE...
IF YOU WANT TO TRY
SOMETHING DIFFICULT...
IF YOU WANT TO TRY TO
ACHIEVE THE IMPOSSIBLE...
YOU TRY 13 WEEKS OF HELL
AT PARRIS ISLAND,
SOUTH CAROLINA,
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT
IF YOU GOT WHAT IT TAKES.
YOU'LL FIND OUT
IF YOU REALLY ARE A MAN,
THEN THE MARINES MAY BE
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
TARAWA...
IWO JIMA...
BELLEAU WOOD...
THE FROZEN CHOSAN RESERVOIR.
FIRST TO FIGHT.
WE HAVE NEVER LOST A WAR.
WE HAVE ALWAYS COME WHEN
OUR COUNTRY'S CALLED US.
NOW, SERGEANT BOWERS AND I
WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THIS UP
TO QUESTIONS.
SO IF ANY OF YOU YOUNG MEN
DO HAVE QUESTIONS,
GO AHEAD AND RAISE YOUR HANDS.
COME ON, NOW.
DON'T BE AFRAID.
DON'T FORGET, A GOOD
MARINE'S A THINKING MARINE.
BILLY VORSOVICH, SIR.
WHEN WOULD I GET TO WEAR
A UNIFORM LIKE YOU?
YOU CAN BE WEARING THIS
IN 13 WEEKS.
GO! GO!
GO, MASSAPEQUA!
GO! GO! GO!
YAY!
YAY!
HI, DONNA.
GO! GO!
GO, MASSAPEQUA!
GO!
MY BROTHER'S AT SCHOOL
AT ADELPHI.
HE SAID THERE WILL BE A WAR IN...
WHAT IS IT?
VIETNAM.
THE MARINES WILL BE
THE FIRST IN,
AND IT WON'T LAST LONG.
SO IF WE DON'T SIGN UP
SOON, WE'LL MISS IT.
I'VE ALREADY DECIDED.
I'M GOING IN.
REALLY?
JUST LIKE THAT?
I'M NOT WAITING.
I'M GOING IN NOW.
YOU'RE CRAZY.
OUR DADS GOT TO GO TO WWII.
THIS IS OUR CHANCE
TO BE PART OF HISTORY.
YEAH, JUST LIKE OUR DADS.
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
IT COULD BE DANGEROUS
OVER THERE.
YOU COULD GET YOURSELF KILLED.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING,
SQUIRREL HEAD? COLLEGE?
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING
WITH MY LIFE.
I CAN GET A DEGREE IN
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION.
YOU DON'T NEED
TO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY?
DON'T YOU CARE
ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF?
BETTER DEAD THAN RED.
THEY GOT MISSILES POINTED
AT US EVERYWHERE. ICBMS.
COMING IN ALL AROUND US.
CUBA NOW.
90 MILES AWAY.
THEY'RE TAKING OVER.
WHEN WILL WE STOP THEM?
YOU CAN'T STOP THEM BY YOURSELF.
COMMUNISM IS
MOVING IN EVERYWHERE.
WHERE, RONNIE?
I DON'T SEE THEM.
THEY'RE NOT HERE IN MASSAPEQUA,
SO I'LL JUST TAKE CARE
OF NUMBER ONE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ME... STEVIE, NUMBER ONE.
SOMEONE'S GOT TO STAY
WITH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN
WHILE THE MEN
GO DO THE FIGHTING.
ALL I'M SAYING IS,
THINK ABOUT IT.
THINK ABOUT IT, RONNIE.
STEVIE, WHO ARE YOU TAKING
TO THE PROM?
WENDY DANIELS.
WENDY DANIELS?
WENDY DANIELS?
HE GOT DESPERATE.
WELL, WHO ARE YOU TAKING,
JOEY, YOUR MOTHER?
RONNIE, WHO ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE TO THE PROM?
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.
SHE'S A PRETTY GIRL
FROM RONKONKOMA.
WHAT'S HER NAME?
YOU DON'T KNOW HER.
WHAT'S HER NAME, RONNIE?
HER NAME IS LOMBARDI.
LOMBARDI?
YEAH.
VINCE LOMBARDI?
ROSANNA LOMBARDI.
SHE'S FROM OUT OF TOWN, RIGHT?
SHE GOING TO GET A MOTEL?
'CAUSE I'D LIKE
TO GET IN ON THAT.
RONNIE, WOULD YOU TAKE THIS
TO SECTION THREE?
CHECK THE STOCK FOR DOG FOOD.
DOG FOOD.
THEN FINISH
STACKING THE POTATOES.
COME ON. LET'S GO.
LET'S DO SOME WORK FOR A CHANGE.
THIS GOES IN SECTION THREE?
SECTION THREE.
O.K., DAD.
HEY, DONNA.
HI, RONNIE.
HI, RONNIE.
HI, RONNIE.
HOW YOU DOING?
HOW'S...
GOOD.
I HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOING
INTO THE MARINES.
YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S BETTER THAN WORKING AT A&P.
THAT'S GREAT, RONNIE.
THAT'S WONDERFUL.
I'M GOING TO BOOT CAMP SOON.
I JOINED FOR FOUR YEARS,
SO I GO TO VIETNAM,
PROBABLY ON THE FRONT LINE.
REALLY?
I'LL SEE A LOT OF ACTION.
WOW.
THAT'S NEAT.
HEARD YOU GOT INTO THAT SCHOOL.
THE LETTER?
YEAH.
YEAH, SYRACUSE.
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD.
COULD I... COULD I TALK
TO YOU IN PRIVATE?
OH, YEAH. SURE.
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO CALL YOU.
I WAS WONDERING,
ARE YOU GOING WITH
SOMEONE TO THE PROM?
YEAH. I'M GOING
WITH JED.
OH, YEAH?
THAT'S GREAT.
I MEAN, HE'S
A NICE GUY... JED.
STEVIE BOYER TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE TAKING SOME GIRL
FROM LAKE RONKONKOMA.
YEAH. NO, NO.
NO?
NO. I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR THAT STUFF.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
TO TAKE CARE OF
BEFORE YOU GO IN THE MARINES.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW MUCH STUFF.
MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU
BEFORE I LEAVE, O.K.?

MICKEY SWINGS, AND HE CONNECTS!
THERE'S A LONG DRIVE
DEEP TO CENTER FIELD!
IT IS GOING, GOING!

THE FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION
IS THE LATEST CONCEPT
IN MOBILE WARFARE.
ONE DIVISION IS WORTH
21/2 RUSSIAN
AND 6 CHINESE DIVISIONS.
HOW WELL WILL
THE INDIVIDUAL SOLDIER
STAND UP HERE IN VIETNAM?
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DAD, ABOUT THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
13,000 MILES...
THAT'S A LONG WAY TO GO
TO FIGHT A WAR.
THEY FOUGHT THE FRENCH
AND THE JAPANESE
FOR 30 YEARS.
CAN THEY BE WEEDED OUT?
ANYTHING THAT LIVES IN A CAVE
CAN BE WEEDED OUT.
I JUST HOPE THEY SEND YOU
TO EUROPE OR KOREA OR...
THEY CAN'T.
SOMEPLACE SAFE.
EVERY MARINE HAS
A TOUR OF DUTY THERE.
IT'S NOT LIKE THE ARMY.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU SERVED.
UNCLE BOB SERVED.
I KNOW, RONNIE.
I KNOW.
REMEMBER WHAT
PRESIDENT KENNEDY SAID?
THERE WON'T BE
AN AMERICA ANYMORE
UNLESS PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE.
I LOVE MY COUNTRY.
I KNOW.
AND YOU'RE RIGHT, RONNIE.
YOU'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
COMMUNISM HAS TO BE STOPPED.
IT'S GOD'S WILL YOU GO.
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.
BE CAREFUL, THAT'S ALL.
UP THERE IN HANOI,
THEY DON'T ALLOW MAGAZINES,
NEWSPAPERS, AND TELEVISIONS
TO CAST DOUBTS
ON THE MILITARY SYSTEM.
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT BEING A MARINE
MEANS TO ME, DAD?
EVER SINCE I WAS A KID,
I'VE WANTED TO SERVE MY COUNTRY,
AND I WANT TO GO.
I WANT TO GO TO VIETNAM,
AND I'LL DIE THERE IF I HAVE TO.
THE ATTITUDE OF PEOPLE
ON THE HOME FRONT
IS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS WAR.
NOT A NICE NIGHT FOR THE PROM.
CAN THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE
GOVERNMENT
STAND UP TO THE NORTH?
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF WE DIDN'T THINK SO.
SOMETIMES, GOD, I'M SO CONFUSED.
SOMETIMES I THINK I'D JUST...
LIKE TO STAY HERE IN MASSAPEQUA
AND NEVER LEAVE...
BUT I GOT TO GO.
JUST HELP ME, JESUS.
HELP ME TO MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.
PLEASE, DEAR GOD.
RON.
RONNIE, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
RONNIE.
WHAT...
OH, JEEZ.
DONNA.

IT WAS VERY, VERY UNFORTUNATE.
THE ENEMY USED
THE VILLAGERS AS COVER.
YES, SIR.
THEY POPPED UP, STARTED FIRING.
WE WERE RUNNING BACK, SIR.
IT WAS REAL GLARY.
VERY CONFUSING,
AND THAT'S WHEN
IT HAPPENED, SIR.
WHAT HAPPENED?

HE WAS COMING UP OVER THE DUNE.
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE KILLED HIM.
IT'S HARD.
I WAS OUT A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
SOMETIMES IT'S... VERY HARD
TO TELL WHAT'S HAPPENING.
YES, SIR.
BUT, SIR, I THINK
I KILLED WILSON.
I DON'T THINK SO, KOVIC.
BUT, SIR, I WANT YOU

IN THE BEDROOM OVER HERE.
MY HAPPAUGE BOYER'S GROSSED
85 GRAND LAST SIX MONTHS.
MY COMPETITOR'S RUSHING IN TO BUILD,
BUT I WAS FIRST.
THE PEOPLE ARE LOYAL.
YOU PROBABLY THINK
IT'S JUST A HAMBURGER.
A PATTY'S JUST A PIECE OF MEAT,
BUT IT CAN HAVE CHARACTER.
SEE THAT DOUGHNUT HOLE?
GETS 18 PATTIES TO THE POUND
INSTEAD OF 16.
SAVES ME ABOUT $40,000 A YEAR.
THAT'S SERIOUS MONEY, RON.
I PLUG THE HOLE
WITH LETTUCE, TOMATOES,
ONIONS, SPICES.
I COVER IT WITH A PICKLE.
THEY'LL NEVER MISS A THING.
THEY'LL NEVER MISS A THING.
GIVE ME A GOOD ONE
FOR RONNIE. THANKS.
GOOD JOB. TRY THIS.
YOU DON'T FIND THAT
AT MCDONALD'S ON SUNRISE.
I GOT A DRIVE-IN
WINDOW, TOO.
IT'S LONG ISLAND'S FIRST.
IT'S CLEAN,
IT'S CHEAP, IT'S FAST.
FEED THE FAMILY
FOR $3.95.
CHECK OUT THESE CHICKS.
THEY'RE WEARING
THOSE NEW MINISKIRTS.
IT'S MY IDEA.
IT'S GOOD FOR TIPS.
THE CUSTOMERS ALWAYS COME BACK.
MASSAPEQUA'S CHANGED.
WATCH YOURSELF.
IT'S NO MOM AND POP
OPERATION ANYMORE.
THIS IS OUR TOWN.
YOU'RE DOING A NICE JOB.
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
GOOD.
COPIAGUE, RONNIE,
JERICHO, BAYVILLE,
VALLEY STREAM, MAN.
I WANT TO TURN BOYER'S
INTO A WHOLE LONG ISLAND THING.
I WANT YOU TO COME
TO WORK FOR ME.
WHAT CAN I DO?
THIS IS OUR TOWN NOW.
YOU'RE A WAR HERO,
AND YOU CAN BENEFIT.
YOU SHOULD BENEFIT, RONNIE.
YOU MEAN, LIKE PARTNERS?
WE OPEN A PLACE TOGETHER?
YOU GOT TO WALK BEFORE YOU RUN.
I COULD START YOU OUT
AS A CASHIER.
THEN YOU COULD
LEARN THE BUSINESS,
WORK YOUR WAY UP TO BE MANAGER,
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.
I GET 1,700 A MONTH
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
I'LL TAKE MY TIME.
THAT'S CHARITY MONEY.
THIS ISN'T.
CHARITY?
HERE'S YOUR COLA.
YOU GOT TO PUT
THE WAR BEHIND YOU.
FORGET ABOUT
THIS CHAIR YOU'RE IN.
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, STEVIE,
I THINK PEOPLE KNOW
YOU'RE BACK FROM VIETNAM,
AND THEIR FACE CHANGES,
THE EYES...
THE VOICE, THE WAY
THEY LOOK AT YOU.
I KNOW, BUT PEOPLE HERE,
THEY DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT THE WAR.
IT'S JUST A MILLION MILES AWAY.
IT'S ALL BULLSHIT.
THE GOVERNMENT SOLD US
A BILL OF GOODS.
WE GOT THE SHIT
KICKED OUT OF US.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "WE"?
YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.
IT WAS YOU WHO BOUGHT
THAT COMMUNIST BULLSHIT.
YEAH. THEY WERE GOING
TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD.
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
FINNELLI, YOU, WALSH.
THE WHOLE TOWN WAS DEVASTATED.
FOR WHAT?
FOR LIES?
FOR BULLSHIT LIES?
THEY BURN THE FLAG.
THEY DEMONSTRATE AGAINST US
ON THE COVER OF THE PAPER TODAY.
THEY HAVE NO RESPECT.
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE
AND THE MEN THAT ARE
SACRIFICING THEIR LIVES.
NOBODY HERE SEEMS TO CARE.
IT'S A BUNCH OF GODDAMNED SHIT.
DON'T TAKE THE LORD'S NAME IN VAIN
IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN.
I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAY.
I SERVED MY COUNTRY.
THEY JUST WANT TO TAKE FROM IT.
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT.
THE OTHER SIDE'S ANGRY
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WINNING.
HOW CAN WE WIN?
TOMMY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
NOTHING.
ANYBODY LISTENING HERE?
TOMMY?
WHAT?
TOMMY'S GOING TO FAIL ENGLISH.
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE WAR.
WHAT?
HE THINKS WE'RE DOING
THE WRONG THING
OVER THERE.
HE THINKS IT'S ALL A MISTAKE.
MISTAKE? WHAT'S THIS?
SPIT IT OUT.
YOU BELIEVE IN DEMONSTRATORS?
HUH? WHAT?
I JUST DON'T AGREE
WITH EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DOES TOMMY KNOW?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND?
HE'S HANGING AROUND
WITH LONGHAIRS
WHO TAKE DRUGS!
THAT'S NOT THE REASON.
HAVE THEY EVER WORKED?
YOU WANT TO BURN THE FLAG?
HUH, TOMMY?
WHAT IS THIS?
YOU WANT TO
BRING DOWN THIS COUNTRY?
LOVE IT OR LEAVE IT, TOMMY.
ALL THEY'RE
TRYING TO SAY, RONNIE,
IS THEY DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE
TO COME BACK LIKE YOU.
THAT'S AN EASY EXCUSE.
WHERE WERE THEY WHEN
THEIR COUNTRY NEEDED THEM?
YOU SERVED YOUR COUNTRY.
WHAT DID YOU GET OUT OF IT?
LOOK AT YOU.
WELL, LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT YOU, MAN.
I GOT TO GO. I'LL SEE
YOU AROUND, ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME, TOMMY?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME?
I VOLUNTEERED, TOMMY!
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
WERE YOU THERE?
YOU CAN JUST LOVE IT
OR LEAVE IT, TOMMY!
MOM, I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT TOMMY JUST SAID TO ME.
I CAN'T...
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT TOMMY JUST SAID TO ME.
PARADE TIME, RONNIE.
YOU TELL THEM I'LL BE

THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE THERE.
SOME PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO
TEAR OUR COUNTRY DOWN.
BUT WHO ARE THE KIDS
DEFENDING THEIR RIGHT
TO PROTEST?
THESE ARE THE KIDS
WHO CARE ABOUT AMERICA,
KIDS WHO HAVE RESPECT
FOR THEIR FLAG
AND THEIR PARENTS
AND THEIR GOVERNMENT
AND THEIR RELIGION.
KIDS LIKE JOEY WALSH.
HE WAS THE FIRST.
WE GOT A STREET
IN THE PARK NAMED AFTER HIM.
AND DANNY TOPINKA,
BILLY VORSOVICH,
PHIL AND LARRY POWELL,
TOMMY FINNELLI.
SIX BOYS FROM MASSAPEQUA...
AND THEY ALL KNEW
WHAT HONOR, DUTY,
AND SACRIFICE MEANT.
THEY PAID THE HIGHEST PRICE.
THEY DIED FOR IT.
THIS TOWN'S BEEN HIT HARD.
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HIT HARD.
DOC HERE, HE WAS
IN THE FIRST WAR.
A LOT OF US HERE
WERE IN THE SECOND.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T GIVE UP.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO
WIN IN VIETNAM.
BECAUSE MASSAPEQUA'S
BEEN THERE BEFORE,
BECAUSE OF THOSE
SIX WONDERFUL BOYS,
AND BECAUSE OF HIM.
RON...
COME SAY A FEW WORDS,
WOULD YOU, PLEASE?
RON KOVIC, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
HE WAS BORN
ON THE 4TH OF JULY, 1946.
GIVE HIM A BIG HAND
ON HIS GREAT BIRTHDAY.
I JUST WANT TO SAY
FOR THE GUYS IN VIETNAM
THAT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST.
IT'S NOT AN EASY SITUATION,
BUT THE BOYS' MORALE
OVER THERE IS REAL HIGH,
AND YOU CAN FEEL
CONFIDENT THAT WE ARE...
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THAT WAR.
I SERVED MY COUNTRY,
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL SORRY FOR ME.
DO NOT SHED A TEAR.
I HAVE MY HANDS,
MY EYES, MY EARS...
I HAVE MY HEART...
AND I HAVE...
WHAT I FEEL...
I HAVE WHAT I FEEL IS...
AN UNQUEN... QUENCHABLE...
O.K. IT'S O.K., RONNIE.

WHEN DID YOU GET OUT?
WOW, MAN.
LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE.
MR. KOVIC?
YEAH. SURE.
ANTIWAR DEMONSTRATORS HAVE COME
TO WASHINGTON, D.C.
TO SHUT THE CITY DOWN.
AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN,
STARRING DAN ROWAN
AND DICK MARTIN,
WITH SAMMY DAVIS, JR.
AND JUDY CARNE...
HONEY.
COME ON.
IT'S STARTING.
O.K. I'M COMING.
IT'S THE ONE WITH SAMMY DAVIS.
OH, YEAH?
WHO ELSE USED TO PLAY?
COME ON, RONNIE.
NO. COME ON.
TELL ME WHO.
BOBBY MOORE AT SHORTSTOP.
GRADY ROGERS AT THIRD.
GRADY GOT SICK.
IT WAS FINNELLI AT THIRD.
TOMMY FINNELLI.
YEAH.
GOT HIT WITH ONE
OF HIS OWN MORTARS.
THAT'S CRAZY, MAN.
SHIT, I HEARD ABOUT THAT.
REMEMBER THE TWINS,
PHIL AND LARRY POWELL?
OH, THE TWINS. OH.
THEY WERE GREAT WRESTLERS.
OH, MAN.
THEY WERE FUCKING GREAT.
TOUGH.
TOUGH BASTARDS.
WHEN PHIL GOT KILLED,
LARRY... WHO WASN'T MUCH
FOR BRAINS EITHER...
WENT DOWN THE NEXT DAY
AND JOINED UP.
OH, GOD.
THEN HE GOT HIT.
OH, NO.
IT'S TRUE.
A LAND MINE OR SOMETHING.
HE GOT HIT IN THE HEAD
WITH A TREE.
YEAH. I'M TELLING
YOU THE TRUTH.
HE GOES OVER TO VIETNAM,
AND HE GETS KILLED
BY A FLYING FUCKING TREE.
OH.
THAT'S REALLY FUCKING FUNNY.
I THINK THE WHOLE
TOWN GOT DEVASTATED, RONNIE.
I DON'T THINK
WE GOT A FRIEND LEFT.
IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
WHEN DID YOU GET HIT, TIMMY?
SEPTEMBER THE 18TH.
NEAR DONG HA.
A LOT OF BAD SHIT
UP THERE, RONNIE,
I'M TELLING YOU.
THINGS I DON'T
EVEN WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
YOU KNOW.
I MEAN, UH...
IT WAS CRAZY.
SHOOTING ANYTHING THAT...
ANYTHING THAT FUCKING MOVED,
YOU KNOW?
WHEN DID YOU...
WHEN DID YOU GET HIT?
ME?
WELL...
UH, JANUARY 20TH.
YES.
SOMEPLACE OFF... I DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER.
UP IN THE DMZ.
WALKED INTO
A WHOLE BATTALION OF THEM.
GOT SHOT IN THE FOOT.
I GOT UP LIKE I WAS...
BACK IN THE WOODS AGAIN,
LIKE I WAS JOHN FUCKING WAYNE,
EMPTYING A MAG, SCREAMING,
"COME ON, CHARLIE, MOTHERFUCKER!
COME ON OUT,
CHARLIE, MOTHERFUCKER!"
RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT.
I HEARD THIS CRACK
ABOVE MY RIGHT EAR,
AND I JUST FELT MY BODY...
DROP OUT FROM UNDER ME.
WELL, I THOUGHT
I WAS DEAD FOR SURE.
WAS THE, UH...
HOW WAS THE HOSPITAL?
IT SUCKED.
I KNOW.
REALLY BAD.
I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING, RONNIE...
SOMETIMES AT NIGHT...
I GET THESE HEADACHES, YOU KNOW?
THEY'RE BAD.
AND, UH...
THEY JUST KIND OF COME OVER ME,
AND THESE DOCTORS
DON'T KNOW SHIT, YOU KNOW.
THEY JUST COME,
LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T FEEL... I DON'T FEEL
LIKE ME ANYMORE, YOU KNOW?
I FEEL LIKE...
WHEN THEY COME,
I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE.
WHAT DO YOU DO?
NOTHING. NOT A GODDAMNED
THING, YOU KNOW?
WELL... MOSTLY I DO
A LOT OF DRUGS.
DO ANYTHING YOU CAN, YOU KNOW?
Y-YOU GET THROUGH IT
ANY WAY YOU CAN.
WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,
I THOUGHT, "YEAH.
YEAH, THIS MAKES SENSE."
WHAT MAKES SENSE?
'CAUSE I FAILED, TIMMY.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
'CAUSE I...
'CAUSE I KILLED SOMEONE...
SOME PEOPLE. I...
I MADE SOME TERRIBLE...
MISTAKES.
RONNIE, WE ALL MADE MISTAKES.
I MEAN, YOU...
YOU HAD NO CHOICE.
THOSE DAMN PANSY DEMONSTRATORS
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.
DON'T TALK ABOUT IT.
IT WAS INSANE OVER THERE.
SOMETIMES I WISH...
I WISH I'D...
WHEN I GOT SHOT IN THE FOOT,
I COULD HAVE LAID DOWN.
WHO GIVES A FUCK NOW
IF I WAS A HERO OR NOT?
I WAS PARALYZED,
CASTRATED THAT DAY. WHY?
'CAUSE I WAS SO S...
STUPID.
I HAVE MY DICK AND MY BALLS NOW
AND I THINK...
I THINK, TIMMY,
I'D GIVE EVERYTHING I BELIEVE IN,
EVERYTHING I GOT...
ALL MY VALUES
JUST TO HAVE MY BODY AGAIN,
JUST TO BE WHOLE AGAIN.
BUT I'M NOT WHOLE.
I NEVER WILL BE, AND THAT'S...
THE WAY IT IS, ISN'T IT?
RONNIE...
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
YOU'RE ALIVE.
YOU MADE IT.
SMILE.

ANDY HENDERSON.
AND THE RUTLEDGE BOY, LANCE.
YEAH, LANCE.
HE WAS A NICE BOY.
FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I STILL CAN'T QUITE
FIGURE THAT WAR OUT.
WHY WE HAD TO GO
ALL THAT DANG WAY TO FIGHT IT
AND WHY'S WE HAD TO LOSE
SO MANY YOUNG MEN.
CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT.
BUT WE GOT A PROUD TRADITION
HERE IN THIS TOWN.
BILLY'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER
WAS AT THE FIRST BULL RUN.
MY PA WAS OVER IN FRANCE IN '18.
DON'T FORGET, YOU WERE
OVER IN THE PACIFIC IN '44.
GUADALCANAL.
IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH. WELL, I GUESS
THIS FAMILY'S FOUGHT
IN EVERY WAR THAT, UH,
THIS COUNTRY'S EVER HAD.
I RECKON WE'RE READY
TO DO IT AGAIN
IF'N WE HAVE TO.
'COURSE THEY NEVER DID KNOW
WHAT DONE HAPPENED AND ALL.
THERE WAS A LETTER
FROM A COLONEL,
I THINK IT WAS.
COLONEL MOORE.
THAT'S RIGHT, COLONEL MOORE.
HE SAID THERE WAS
A BAD AMBUSH ONE NIGHT.
SAID THAT BILLY DISTINGUISHED HIMSELF
IN THE FIGHTING.
HE ALSO TOLD US THAT
BILLY DIED REAL QUICK.
THAT'S GOOD THAT HE DIED QUICK.
I WAS HIS SQUAD LEADER.
I DIDN'T KNOW BILLY REAL WELL.
HE WAS NEW, KIND OF QUIET.
WE DIDN'T TALK MUCH TO NEW GUYS.
HE WAS 19, IS THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT, 19.
ONLY SON?
YES, SIR.
MY ONLY BOY.
I THINK HE SAID HE WAS MARRIED
AND YOU WERE PREGNANT?
I REMEMBER
THE DAY HE WAS KILLED.
UH... IT WAS
A STRANGE DAY.
WE WERE OUT ON PATROL
NEAR A BEACH AREA...
AND, OH, IT WAS VERY CONFUSING.
THERE WAS SCREAMING AND FIRING.
UH...
IT WAS GETTING LATE,
AND THERE WERE THESE
CHILDREN, UH...
THESE BABIES...
THAT WE KILLED BY MISTAKE.
HOW AWFUL.
AND THEN IT...
GOT REALLY CRAZY.
AND WE HAD TO PULL BACK
BECAUSE THE NVA
WERE COMING UP ON US.
AND WE GOT SCATTERED
IN THE DUNES.
PEOPLE WERE YELLING AT ANYTHING,
FIRING AT ANYTHING.
AND THAT WAS WHEN IT...
IT HAPPENED.
I WAS, UH, CONFUSED...
SCARED.
I RAISED MY RIFLE THREE TIMES...
AND... SHOTS...
THE BODY FELL IN THE DUNES.
GOD, THIS IS...
THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT
FOR ME TO SAY.
WE DON'T HAVE TO HEAR THIS, RON.
BUT I THINK I WAS THE ONE
THAT KILLED YOUR SON.
I WAS THE ONE.
I WAS THE ONE.
I WAS THE ONE.
WHAT'S DONE IS DONE, SIR.
I CAN'T EVER FORGIVE YOU...
BUT MAYBE THE LORD CAN.
WE UNDERSTAND, RON.
WE UNDERSTAND THE PAIN
YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.
PEACE NOW!
PEACE NOW!
PEACE NOW!
PEACE NOW!
PEACE NOW!
BRING OUR BROTHERS HOME NOW!
BRING OUR BROTHERS HOME NOW!
BRING OUR BROTHERS HOME NOW!
BRING OUR BROTHERS HOME NOW!
BRING OUR BROTHERS HOME NOW!

SEPARATE THE HIPPIES.
TONIGHT, I AGAIN PROUDLY
ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION
FOR PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
AND LET US PLACE OURSELVES
TO WIN AN EVEN GREATER VICTORY
THIS NOVEMBER IN 1972.
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
FOUR MORE YEARS!

CAN I BREAK THROUGH
YOUR COMPLACENCY?
DO YOU HAVE COMPASSION
FOR THE PEOPLE
SUFFERING IN THIS WAR?
I'M TELLING YOU
THIS WAR IS A CRIME!
I'M NOT AS BITTER
ABOUT MY WOUNDS...
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
CAN I HELP YOU, SIR?
YOU CAN'T COME THROUGH.
YOU CAN'T COME THROUGH, SIR.
I HAVE A PASS.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
YOU CAN'T STOP US!
YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
YOU CAN'T STOP ME!
WHY ARE YOU HERE TONIGHT?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY?
MY NAME'S RON KOVIC.
I'M A VIETNAM VETERAN.
I'M HERE TO SAY
THIS WAR IS WRONG,
THAT THIS SOCIETY LIED
TO ME AND MY BROTHERS...
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?
IT DECEIVED THE PEOPLE
IN THIS COUNTRY.
IT TRICKED THEM
INTO GOING 13,000 MILES
TO FIGHT A WAR AGAINST
A POOR PEASANT PEOPLE
WHO HAVE A PROUD HISTORY
OF RESISTANCE,
WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING
FOR THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE
FOR 1,000 YEARS...
THE VIETNAMESE PEOPLE.
I CAN'T... I CAN'T FIND
THE WORDS TO EXPRESS
HOW THE LEADERSHIP
OF THIS GOVERNMENT SICKENS ME.
NOW, PEOPLE SAY...
PEOPLE SAY IF YOU
DON'T LOVE AMERICA,
THEN GET THE HELL OUT.
WELL, I LOVE AMERICA,
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO THE GOVERNMENT,
IT STOPS RIGHT THERE.
THE GOVERNMENT IS
A BUNCH OF CORRUPT THIEVES.
THEY ARE RAPISTS AND ROBBERS.
WE ARE HERE TO SAY
WE DON'T
HAVE TO TAKE IT ANYMORE.
WE ARE HERE TO TELL THE TRUTH.
THEY'RE KILLING
OUR BROTHERS IN VIETNAM.
WE WANT THEM TO HEAR THE TRUTH.
TRAITOR!
WHAT ARE YOU, A COMMUNIST?
IS THIS WHAT WE GET,
SPIT IN THE FACE?
IS THIS WHAT WE GET?
IS THIS WHAT WE GET, SIR?
SPIT IN THE FACE?
WE'RE NEVER GOING
TO LET THE PEOPLE
FORGET THAT WAR!
FOUR MORE YEARS!
YOU'RE NOT SWEEPING IT
UNDER THE RUG
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
LIKE THE RATINGS.
THIS WHEELCHAIR,
OUR WHEELCHAIRS,
THIS STEEL, OUR STEEL
IS YOUR MEMORIAL DAY ON WHEELS.
WE'RE YOUR YANKEE
DOODLE DANDY COME HOME.
WE'RE YOUR YANKEE DOODLE DANDY.
LET'S REJECT ANY PHILOSOPHY
THAT WOULD MAKE US
A DIVIDED PEOPLE OF AMERICA.
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE WAR!
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE WAR!
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE WAR!
SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE
HAS BROKEN OUT
ON THE CONVENTION FLOOR,
DISABLED VETERANS
PROTESTING THE VIETNAM WAR.
WE'LL TRY TO GET DOWN THERE.
WHY ARE THEY GASSING US
IN THE PARKING LOT?
WHY ARE THEY FIGHTING US?
BECAUSE IT'S A LIE.
THE TRUTH IS
THEY'VE KILLED A GENERATION
OF YOUNG MEN.
THEY HAVE SACRIFICED
A WHOLE GENERATION OF YOUNG MEN.
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE BOMBING!
COMMUNISTS!
COMMUNISTS!
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE WAR!
STOP THE BOMBING!
STOP THE WAR!
TRAITOR!
GO HOME!
I SAY TO YOU TONIGHT...
IN THESE TIMES,
WHEN THERE IS SO MUCH
OF A TENDENCY
TO RUN DOWN THOSE
WHO HAVE SERVED AMERICA
IN THE PAST AND TODAY,
LET'S GIVE THOSE
WHO HAVE SERVED IN VIETNAM
THE HONOR AND THE RESPECT
THAT THEY DESERVE
AND THAT THEY'VE EARNED.
