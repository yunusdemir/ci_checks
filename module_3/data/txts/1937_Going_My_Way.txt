But, Father Fitzgibbon,
why do you want a new furnace?
Because, Mr. Haines, last winter
in the month of November alone...
four of me parishioners took
to the bed with pneumonia.
- That's too bad.
- It's only by a miracle
that I meself pulled through.
It'll only cost $632.50,
complete with an automatic damper.
Father Fitzgibbon, I didn't come here
to put in new furnaces.
I think you ought to give him
his furnace, Dad.
It would warm people's hearts, and
maybe his collections would be bigger.
No, no, son.
Improvements are out.
- Now, Father...
- That was good.
What he said, that was good.
Oh, well, he's new to our business.
Now, Father...
- No furnace, huh?
- No furnace. Now, Father,
here's my business.
You owe the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company
five payments on this mortgage.
If they're not taken care of,
I'm afraid the Knickerbocker
Savings and Loan Company...
will have to take
the necessary action, huh?
Why don't you make that the subject
of your sermon next Sunday?
Tell it to your people.
The Lord loveth a cheerful giver.
Oh, I can imagine meself
saying that in Mass next Sunday.
What a sermon that
would be, Mr. Haines.
[Fitzgibbon] "The text of me sermon
this morning is taken from...
- the mortgage according to Mr. Haines...
- [Chuckling]
From the 1st to the 23rd clause."
Very dull, you know.
Oh, but that's your business.
Keep it bright, huh?
But seriously, Father, we have made
a bad loan, and we want our money back.
- Well, you'll get it somehow.
- That's all I wanted to know.
Good day, Father.
Come on, son.
Dad, you can't foreclose.
Why, it just isn't being done.
I read up on it
and there's never been...
a Catholic church foreclosure
in the history of New York.
There's always a first time,
isn't there?
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh with him?
You've got to be.
Son, never loan money to a church.
As soon as you start
to close in on them,
everybody thinks you're a heel.
- Well, aren't you?
- Yes.
Good morning. Could you tell me
where I'd find Saint Dominic's Church?
- Eh?
- I'm looking for St. Dominic's Church.
- Why?
- I'm gonna work there.
The new assistant, eh?
And you can't even
find the church.
Well, all I can say is,
young man,
you're off to a mighty bad start.
What's your name?
Father O'Malley.
Charles Francis Patrick O'Malley.
- What's yours?
- [Woman] Her name is Quimp!
[Laughing]
Hattie Quimp!
You'll see a lot of her. At St.
Dominic's, she's a regular two-a-day-er.
Very religious, burns candles.
I could tell ya plenty
about them too.
And if I did, they'd have to leave
the neighborhood. [Thudding]
[Window Closing]
If you're lookin'
for St. Dominic's, Father,
- it's a block up and then to your left.
- Thank you.
[Chattering]
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How's things goin'?
- Terrible. They never hit one to me.
- Watch right field for me
a minute, will ya, Father?
- Sure.
- I gotta run in the house.
- Okay.
- Hey, fellas, the Father's
gonna take my place.
- Okay, Father.
I got it! Got it!
- [Glass Shattering]
- [Children Shouting]
Thanks!
[Woman]
Hurry up! Come on!
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm the substitute right fielder.
You ought to be ashamed of
yourself, playing with kids,
smashing people's windows.
- A big grown-up man.
- And a priest besides.
- Oh, hello.
- Still looking for St. Dominic's.
You just wait 'til
I tell Father Fitzgibbon.
Look, you keep out of this,
will ya? Go on, go on.
- This is between him and me.
- Honestly, I'm sorry about the window.
Yeah, but bein' sorry
don't fix it.
- I intend to pay for it.
- When?
Priests never have any money.
That window...
Now, wait a minute, my good man,
I said I'd pay for it.
I told you I'm sorry.
What else can I say
after I say I'm sorry?
That ain't the idea.
It's the principle of the thing.
A priest didn't ought to go around
breaking people's windows.
- It sets a bad example for the children.
- You got me stymied there.
- I'm contrite and I'm penitent.
I've told you I'm sorry.
- You told me that twice.
- But that don't...
- That doesn't fix
the broken window, I know.
I think you're just playing
hard to get along with.
- Maybe a little security might help.
- Huh?
These were given to me. Why don't you
keep them 'til I've made good?
Maybe they'll make you
feel better.
- They're mother of pearl, you see?
- Huh?
If that'll satisfy you,
why, I'll run along.
Hey, you, here,
I got no use for this.
First place,
I don't believe in it.
- As a matter of fact,
I don't believe in anything.
- I can believe that.
I'm an atheist;
besides, I'm superstitious.
All right, then, I'm sorry about
the window. I'll have it fixed.
Can I have the ball back?
You even throw like an atheist.
Mrs. Carmody,
did the young priest come yet?
He's here, but he insisted on changin'
his clothes before seein' you.
Ah, that's nice.
Tidy himself up a bit.
Hello, Father.
I'm your new curate, Father.
If you'll excuse my appearance.
No, no, it's not possible.
The Bishop may have a grudge against me.
He may think I've a mouthful
of clover and can't preach,
but even the Bishop wouldn't do
a thing like this to me.
[Chuckling]
I see what you mean.
Young man, is that the official garb
of the priests in St. Louis?
No, l... Something happened
to me on the way over.
I guess this just isn't my day, Father.
Do you mind if l...
Nah.
Eh!
Oh.
Young man, as a matter
of curiosity,
what made you become a priest?
- Why, l...
- [Phone Ringing]
Hello? Well, you don't say. Huh?
Ya don't say.
Oh, yes, I can
well believe it, yeah.
Mrs. Quimp?
[Clearing Throat]
Oh, yes, yes, indeed, Mrs. Quimp.
Yes, indeed, I appreciate
your good intentions. Yes, yes, yes.
- Good-bye, good-bye, good-bye.
- I guess she told you about me, huh?
Yeah, the garrulous old biddy.
Young man, I'm afraid
you're off to a very bad start.
That's what she said.
I'm sorry, Father, l...
Smashin' people's windows.
Such conduct.
Oh, yes, that reminds me.
I wanted to ask you something.
Yeah, listen now.
Tell me, young man,
how did you happen
to become a priest?
- Well, l...
- [Phone Ringing]
Yeah, yeah.
Chuck? Chuck who?
- Father Chuck?
- That's me.
Here, I'll take it over here.
Hello? Timmy!
Well, how are ya, Timmy?
I just got in.
Well, what do you know?
That's Father O'Dowd, an old friend of
mine. We used to go to school together.

You're a big help.
It's a little early to say.
Time will tell though.
Uh-uh, no, I think it would be better
if I told you when I saw you.
Yes, it would be much better.
All right, Timmy, make it soon, huh?
So long.
- Oh, he's a great little man.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh, what were we talkin' about?
- Oh...
- Yes, I was goin' to ask you...

if I want to see the church.
- Yes, that's right.
- Yes.
[Bells Chiming]
[Bells Stop]
- I like this. It's beautiful.
- Thank you.
- How long you been here, Father?
- Uh, 45 years.
- And the...
- 46 in October!
- The church?
- The same. I built it.
- I can only hope someday
I can say I built as much.
- Ah.
- This is nice.

They're good company. Listen.

pleasant place in which to meditate.
- Ya do meditate, don't ya?
- Oh, yes, sure.
Now I'll show you the church.
What we really need
is a loudspeaker system.
Hmph, for a minute I thought
I found a four-leaf clover.
Guess it just isn't my day.

% % % % [Organ]
Oh, Mrs. Carmody, j-just a minute.
Just a minute.
- Where's Father O'Malley?
- He left early this morning.
- The young man doesn't sleep
as late as you do, you know?
- Huh? Oh.
- What's this?
- His luggage. It just arrived.
Golf, tennis, and where,
may I ask, is his fish pole?
It's here. Huh!
- Good mornin', Father.
- Been to market, eh?
Mrs. Carmody could attend to that. You
should have been making parish calls.
I have. Mrs. McGonigle, the one
with the big house and rheumatism.
- She sent you a present.
- Oh, she did, huh?
Very generous of her.
A fine Christian woman, Mrs. McGonigle.
Eh, wonder what 'tis.
Something to eat, I dare say.
- Jam, jam. No, pickled pigs feet.
- [Chuckling]
Possibly some brandied peaches.
If there's one thing I'm partial to,
it's a nice big jar of brandied peaches.
- A nice basket too.
- Yes, she wants it back.
[Whimpering]
Too young, O'Malley. Much too young
to be separated from their mother.
That's what she said.
So, here's the mother.
- Isn't she cute?
- The joy of giving is indeed a pleasure.
Especially when you get rid
of something you don't want.
Oh, Mrs. McGonigle
is famous for these tricks.
When her husband died,
she sent me his umbrella,
his long flannel underwear
and his mustache cup.

- Timmy, how are ya?
- Chuck, I'm glad to see ya.
- How long is it
since we've seen each other?
- Four years.
- Oh, five, anyway.
- Has it been that long?
- Yes!
- Pardon me, Father Fitzgibbon.
- This is my old friend, Father O'Dowd.
- How are you, Father Fitzgibbon?
We've been friends since we
were knee-high to a niblick.
- He was our local Huckleberry Finn.
- [O'Dowd Laughing]
Laugh and the world laughs
with you, he used to say.
- Cry, and you cry all by yourself.
- How are you, Father?
I just dropped by to see
if Father O'Malley could play
a little golf this afternoon?
Oh, you did?
Where's your parish?
Right over here, St. Francis.
Well, now, about your golf.
Of course, I can't answer
for you, but at St. Dominic's
we've very little time...
for games of golf and such like.
If you were working for me,
all I can say is that you
wouldn't have time for it, either.
It's lucky for me then
that I'm at St. Francis.
It's my hope St. Francis
can say the same.
- Uh-oh, he's got you there, Timmy.
- Good, Father, very good.
Say, Father, why don't you come a round
with us sometime? It's a grand game.
Sure, Father, we'll teach ya.
A man is never too old to learn.
[O'Malley] Lot of nice, fresh air
out on the golf course.
And profanity too.
No, a golf course is nothing...
but a poolroom moved outdoors.
[Laughing]
You mind if I use that one
sometime, Father?
Young man, would you mind...
- How did he ever become a priest?
- Oh, well, I don't...
Father Fitzgibbon.
Excuse me.
- Who is it?
- Mrs. Quimp.
Oh!
Does he know?
- Does he know what?
- That you're in charge.
- How'd you know?
- I didn't.
I gathered as much
when I heard you were here.
Everybody knows that St. Dominic's
is in a bad way.
Father Fitzgibbon
is getting to be an old man.
- This needs a young fellow...
- Timmy, look.
- Don't mention it to anybody.
- Oh, no, no.
When I had my talk with the Bishop,
it was our understanding...
that Father Fitzgibbon was
to remain here as pastor and I was...
to try and straighten out St. Dominic's
without hurtin' his feelings.
I see. You're in charge,
but you're not.
I don't think I'd like
an assignment like that.
But the Bishop couldn't very well
put him out to pasture, could he?
"Pasture"?
What's this I hear about a pasture?
I was just saying to him, Father,
the next time I come past your church
I'm going to drop in and see ya.
Good day, Father.
So long, Chuck.
- [Clearing Throat]
- I was goin' to ask ya something.
Oh, yes, the telephone.
Mrs. Quimp just telephoned.
Her landlord is throwin' her out again.
She wants somebody to go down
and see her. You better go.
- I'll go right along, Father.
Would you mind the puppies?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
- Uh,
I'll bet you're
the new assistant,
the one who's going to get St. Dominic's
out of all its trouble.
And I'll bet
you're all the trouble.
I'll wager you're the man
with the mortgage.
- You've heard about the mortgage?
- All churches have mortgages.
It isn't respectable for a church
not to have one. My name is O'Malley.
- Mine is Haines.
- Nice meeting you.
We may have to touch you
for a little more a little later on.
We're gonna need a new paint job
here pretty soon.
I must run along. You look like a man
it'll be a pleasure to do business with.
Yes, uh...
Hmm.
[Woman] Get out! Get out!
You'll not put me out!
I'll pay you me rent
when I get it!
- Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.
Hello, Father. Mrs. Quimp and I
were just discussing you.
Oh, you were?
As you know, I represent the
Knickerbocker Savings and Loan Company.
- Uh-huh.
- Inasmuch as Mrs. Quimp
declines to pay her rent,
the Knickerbocker Savings
and Loan Company refuses to offer
her any further hospitality.
Is she very far in arrears?
Mrs. Quimp has paid us
nothing for six months.
It's very nice of you
to show her leniency.
Supposin' the poor old woman
has no place to go?
The Knickerbocker Savings and Loan
Company is not a charitable institution,
like St. Dominic's.
With us, it's just a matter
of cold-blooded business.
With you it's different. You haven't got
anything and you don't want anything.
That's your business
and people respect you for it.
But I'm not
in your business, see?
If I haven't got anything
and don't want anything, I'm a bum.
Surely there must be something
we can do about it.
I don't know what you're going
to do about it, but I'm going
to throw her right out on her ear.
Why don't you give her a break?
Give her a month to make good in.
- St. Dominic's will guarantee it.
- St. Dominic's?
I can see you haven't been
around long, Father.
St. Dominic's is in worse shape
than Mrs. Quimp.
- My old man happens
to own the mortgage...
- Your father holds the mortgage?
You're darn right he does.
Confidentially, I think
he'd like a way to foreclose.
He wants to tear down the church
and make a parking lot of it.
Can you imagine it?
He's a very disliked man.
I'm sort of following
in his footsteps.
- Junior, eh?
- Yeah.
- [Chickens Squawking]
- [Boy] It's a turkey.
[Gobbling]
[Boy]
Let's cut through the churchyard.
[Gobbling]
- Good afternoon, boys.
- Oh, hello, Father.
That's a fine, fat bird
you have there.
Oh, well, we was sort of
bringin' it over for ya.
- It's, uh, sort of a present.
Ain't it, Herman?
- Y-Yeah!
Well, that's very generous of ya.
Such a fine bird and all.
Now, where, may I ask,
did ya get it?
- Ah, we got...
- We won it in a raffle
over to the theater.
- We were lucky!
- Isn't that great, huh?
- But, surely, your mother...
- Oh, except on Christmas,
Ma don't like turkey.
- She don't?
- Honest.
That's most fortunate for me.
There's nothin' I'm more partial to
than a nice tom turkey.
Roasted, all with dressing.
Well, I appreciate your kindness, boys.
- It ain't nothin', Father.
- On the contrary, I appreciate
the thought behind it.
Small luxuries, like small sacrifices,
are ofttimes the most godly.
Well, bless ya both.
Thank you.
[Gobbling]
Take it i-inside, inside
the kitchen to the housekeeper.
Okay, Father,
we'll see ya later.
[Coughing]
[Fitzgibbon] So you guaranteed
Mrs. Quimp's rent, did ya?
- Of course I did.
- St. Dominic's can't afford it.
I expected you to counsel
Mrs. Quimp, not to adopt her.
- Hmm.
- Ah, hot turkey.
Hot? Of course, it's hot.
That's what I say.
Bless us, O Lord, for these Thy gifts
which we are about to receive. Amen.
Amen.
Say, Father, you know a youngster
around here named Tony Scaponi?
- Uh-huh. What about him?
- This afternoon...
Tony belongs to a fine,
upstanding Catholic family.
Eleven children.
Oh, sure, I know Tony.
- As fine a lad
as there is in the parish.
- Police don't think so.
- Oh, they don't, huh?
- No, if something isn't done
about Tony and his pals,
I'm afraid they're gonna wind up
in a reform school.
- Who told you that?
- The police.
You've been listenin'
to Patrick McCarthy, no doubt.
Let me tell you that that...
That man hasn't been to Mass
in the last ten years.
That may be, but I think
McCarthy's right about those kids.
They're terrorizing
the whole neighborhood.
Hmm. No use talkin' like that.
To hear the police talk,
you'd think that every lad
in the parish was a criminal.
I'll have you know that
the very food there before us...
is brought to us by two of
those very lads that the police
are so maliciously slandering.
Ah, is that so?
Tony Scaponi was one of them.
I gave them both my blessing.
And they gave you the bird.
- Yeah.
- [Laughing]
[Chuckling]
- [Doorbell Ringing]
- I'll get it.
- Hello, McCarthy.
- Oh, good evenin', Father.
Well, I brung 'em.
Tony Scaponi, Herman Langerhanke.
Hi, fellows. I don't think
you have to wait, McCarthy.
Well, okay, Father.
Say, uh, I understand that you fellows
like baseball pretty well, huh?
- Yeah?
- I was thinking, Saturday...
the Yanks are playing
the St. Louis Browns, a doubleheader.
Would you like to go out
and see the games with me?
St. Louis is my old hometown, you know.
Get all the passes I want.
- What do you say?
- Well, I guess so.
- Yeah, sure, I guess
the fellows would like that.
- It's a date then.
- I'll meet you here Saturday at noon?
- That'd be good.
You run along and have your dinner.
I'll go finish my turkey.
Let me see now, uh, where was I?
Oh, yeah, I know.
I was goin' to ask you something.
- Oh, yeah, what made me
become a priest?
- No, no, no, no.
- Uh, about young Tony?
What was it the police accused him of?
- Stealing.
Stealing? Stealing what?
Turkeys.
Seems the boys hijacked a poultry truck
down the street here.
There was quite a bit of excitement.
The driver reported them to the police.
Uh, did the poor man
get his turkeys back?
All but one, Father.
[Clearing Throat]
Thank you.
Ah, McCarthy, how are ya?
- Good mornin', Father.
Uh, you open for business.
- Always open for business.
- Come on in.
- Come on.
Sit down. Stay here.
- Come right in, Pat.
- I got a problem, Father.
- Seems like it's more yours than mine.
- Mm-hmm.
It's her.
Well, Father, it's this way.
- Last night I'm walkin' me beat, see?
- Mm-hmm.
- Who do you think I runs into?
- Her?
- Mm-mm. Mrs. Quimp.
- Ah.
"Officer McCarthy," she says.
You know how the old stool pigeon talks.
- Yes, I do.
- "If you'll go around
the corner, you'll find a girl.
I've been watching her
and she ain't up to no good."
Well, Father, I goes around
the corner and there like
the Quimp says, I finds her.
- Do you follow me, Father?
- Oh, yes, yeah.
Well, I looks at her
and sizes her up.
One of those things, I think.
I'm just about to say to her,
"Look, sister, not on my beat."
But she turns and right away
I sees I'm out of line.
- You follow me, Father?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Well, to get down to it, Father, I find
she's broke and run away from home.
Doesn't know a soul in town.
So, instead of bookin' her,
I takes her home.
It's all right with
the missus one night,
but if she stays any longer, well...
I guess Mrs. McCarthy,
good woman that she is, is no
different from any other woman.
- You follow me, Father?
- Yeah, I follow you.
So, she tells us that she's
run away from home on account of
her folks don't understand her.
We tried arguing with her,
Father, but she's a tough one.
She thinks "Honor thy father
and thy mother" is a belly laugh.
Well, Father, guess I'll let you
pick it up from here.
- Says her name's Carol James.
- All right, McCarthy.
- So long, Father. You can go in now.
- Good-bye.
Come right in.
Won't you sit down over here?
Carol, suppose you give us
your version of it, huh?
I guess it's just
about like he said.
- You don't get along with your parents?
- No.
- So you're going to leave home?
- Oh, I've left.
Hmm. How are you fixed for funds?
I haven't any.
That's how I met Officer McCarthy.
Oh, but I'll get by.
Why don't you go back home?
I tell you, at home
my life is intolerable.
- Parents?
- We don't agree on anything.
Don't like the way I do my hair,
my eyebrows, too much lipstick.
Too something or other, too long,
too short. Do you think it's too short?
Well, l... I don't know.
They even object
to my boyfriends.
If they do let me go out, they say,
"Where are you going? Come home early.
- Come right home after the show."
- "No drive-in."
No matter how early I get in,
it's too late.
And if I say we ran out of gas,
they say I'm lying.
- Are ya?
- Sometimes.
Did you ever think of maybe havin'
the boyfriends over to the house?
[Sighing]
Now you talk like they do.
I can't have them over
to the house because Grandma
sleeps in the living room.
- She does, huh?
- By 9:00 we have to be off the couch.
She needs it for a bed.
Can you imagine?
Of course, you know,
there might be two sides to it.
Maybe you're bein'
a little unreasonable.
- I'm 18.
- Eighteen, huh?
As old as that?
[Whistling]
When I was 18, I thought
my father was pretty dumb.
After a while, when I got to be 21,
I was amazed to find out how much
he'd learned in 3 years.
Oh, well.
Now that you're in New York,
- what do you propose to do?
- I'm going to get a job.
- I'm a singer.
- A singer, huh?
- You any good?
- Of course, I'm good.
- What makes you think so?
- Well, I'm... I'm just good, that's all.
Well, uh, would you sing something
for me? Maybe I can help ya.
- Supposed to be a good judge.
- You wouldn't know
the kind of songs I know.
How do you know?
Oh. Do you happen to know

- What key?

Hello, Father.
This, uh, young lady
came to us for some help.
- Oh. So it's work you're wantin'.
- Yes, Father.
Well, I think maybe
I could place you.
- You can?
- What would you think of
a little general housework?
Mrs. Scaponi, with all those children,
11... no, 12 in October.
I think maybe she could use you.
Oh, no. I'm not looking
for that kind of work.
I don't think you understand,
Father, she's a singer.
% % % % [Humming]
Aren't ya?
Well, now, and where, may I ask,
are ya expectin'
to find employment?
In some nice, cool, airy
nightclub, I suppose.
- Any prospects?
- Well, no. Not exactly.
And you're willin' to starve
rather than push a broom?
You have a home, I presume?
- No, she just left it, Father.
- Go right back to your parents.
A fine, little girl like you
singin' someplace like that,
uh, Blue Goose or something.
But you've got to start
someplace, Father.
Nonsense. Bein' a good wife
and mother is a good enough start
for you, like your own mother.
- Well, good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Here, young lady,
you go home and stay home...
'til the right man
comes around.
The right man will
never come near our house.
But don't worry, I'll get by.
Say, uh, Carol?
Wait just a minute. Father?
- Do you think you could
let me have ten, Father?
- Of what?
Ten dollars. She's all alone.
She hasn't a thing.
Open up our hearts, huh?
Ten dollars.
[Whispering]
Just a minute.
- How about five?
- Five? No, no, a ten, ten.
Carol, I didn't like the way
you said, "I'll get by."
- Here's a little something
to tide you over.
- Father...
It's all right.
It's not charity. It's a loan.
Thanks. I can use it.
I appreciate it.
Carol, I guess there's a lot of things
I should have said to you.
Advice and one thing or another. But
you wouldn't have paid any attention.
After all,
you are 18, aren't you?
- Don't worry. I'll be all right.
- Of course, you will, Carol.
- I'll get by.
- Oh, don't say that.
- Let us hear from you, huh?
- All right, Father.
- Bye.
- Bye, Carol.

Now, look, you, O'Malley's

Now, look, you,
O'Malley's a right guy, see?
- He didn't rat on us
about the turkeys, did he?
- [Group] No.
- Took us to a baseball game, didn't he?
- [Group] Yeah.
- Bought us hot dogs, didn't he?
- Yeah.
He's gonna take us
to a picture show, ain't he?
How do we know?
- Hello, Father.
Say hello to the Father.
- Hello, Father.
Hi, fellows.
- Father, where'd you get the outfit?
- It's the St. Louis Browns.
I told you I used to work out with them.
They thought I brought them luck.
When I left town,
they made me a present of it.
That's just the outfit
to wear in a cellar.
Oh, you, knockin' my team. I guess you
wonder why I asked you down here, huh?
- Well, uh, Father, I want
to talk to you a minute, can I?
- Wanna see me?
- Yeah, just a minute.
- Pardon me, boys.
- Tony, what's on your mind?
- Well, Father, uh,
so you won't have no beef comin',
I'm layin' it on the line, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay. Well, they's here, Father.
Like I promised, only you
should have heard 'em squawk.
Worse than that turkey.
- Oh, the turkey. They did, huh?
- Yeah, they figured...
bein' a priest you was gonna
slip 'em the old routine.
- Oh, yeah.
- Personally, I'm for givin' ya a break.
- What I says with the gang goes.
- Swell of ya, Tony.
It ain't nothin', Father. Only the way
it is now, I'm on the hook for ya, see?
- I'm responsible for ya. Get me?
- I won't let you down.
Maybe ya won't, but I'm tellin' ya,
you step outta line just once,
me and the gang will drop ya
like you was a hot potato, okay?
- Okay. Can I talk to 'em now?
- Oh, sure, go ahead.
Boys, I'm not gonna
do much talkin'.
Like Tony says, I'm gonna
lay it right on the line.
I asked you down here
to do me a favor.
St. Dominic's needs a choir,
and I want to start one.
- Uh-oh!
- I know what you're thinkin',
but it's not gonna be that way.
It's gonna be fun. Believe me,
I like fun as much as anybody.
If it doesn't turn out that way,
if you think I'm trying
to slip something over on you,
well, like Tony says, you can
drop me "like a hot potato."
- What do you say?
You gonna give me a break?
- Father, that depends.
- What is it?
- How many of you here know
"Three Blind Mice"?
- I know it.
- One, two. Any more?
- Oh, come on, you all know it.
- Everybody knows it?
- Sure.
- Fine.
[O'Malley]
What's the matter with him over there?
Oh, Herman?
He's poutin'. Hey, Herman!
- He's got a good bass voice.
You want him?
- Certainly, Tony.
You've got him, Father.
Now, let's see, we got
to divide this up someway.
Hey, Herman, wait a minute.
- The Father wants to see ya.
- Well, I don't wanna see the Father...
- Shh! Keep quiet, will ya?
- Why...
- Don't hit me on the head.
You make me dopey!
- You are dopey.
- Now keep quiet. Come here.
- Well, l...
- Look, he wants a bass singer.
- I ain't a bass singer...
- You are a bass singer.
- Why am I a bass singer?
- That burns me up! Shh! Shh!
- My head! My head!
- [Whispering] He wants a bass singer.
- I don't know how to sing...

[Mrs. Carmody] It's no business
of mine, but sometimes...
the things you do in haste
are the things we most regret.
Think it over a while. Then if you
really feel you must see the Bishop...
- That I do!
- But the boys are much better off
here than the streets.
- I'm sure that was
Father O'Malley's idea.
- I'm a tolerant man.
But there are some things
that get under my skin and
"Three Blind Mice" is one of them.
- But he's young, Father.
- Huh?
I'll admit, maybe
a wee bit impulsive.
But I know he means well.
After all, it was the Bishop himself
did put him here.
And the Bishop himself
will put him someplace else.
I'm going to ask to have
Father O'Malley transferred.
Don't worry. It's not
a bad report I'll be makin'.
I'll just tell the Bishop
that this young man and I differ.
We don't see eye-to-eye. I'd be happier
if he were sent some other place.
It's a long, hard road
you've come, Father.
Forty-five years, and most of the time
carryin' other people's burdens.
The time has come when you
should rest on your oars.
Take things easier.
Enjoy your life.
Let somebody else
carry the load for ya.
Sure, and Father O'Malley's
got a strong pair of shoulders.

Let's sing some more, Father.
- Yeah, let's go ahead.
- Yeah, come on! Let's sing some more.
[Chattering]
- You saw the Bishop, Father?
- Yeah.
Would you ask Father O'Malley
if he'd mind stepping into me study?
[Door Opening]
You want to see me, Father?
Yes, yes, so I did, so I did.
Sit down, sit down.
Father O'Malley,
I've been to see the Bishop.
Oh, you have?
And I want to be frank with you.
I must admit that my purpose
in going to see the Bishop...
was to have you transferred.
I'm sorry you don't like me, Father.
I don't dislike anyone.
- It's just that I disagree with you.
- What did the Bishop say?
After a little talk,
he congratulated me...
on me 45 years at St. Dominic's.
He has a remarkable memory.
He said it was a monument...
to the fact that I had...
built it.
Coming from the Bishop,
that's certainly a fine compliment.
Then I told him
I had come to talk about you.
That seemed to disturb him.
Then he started tellin' me
about what a fine, young man you are,
capable, progressive,
how much confidence he had in you.
He even told me that, uh,
he had a nice talk with ya
before ya reported to me.
Of course, he didn't tell me
what you two talked about.
He didn't have to.
I could see it
in the good man's eyes.
When ya get to my age,
ya can do that, ya know. Oh, yes.
Then, after a little more tellin' me
how progressive you are,
he asked me why I'd come.
And knowin' what was on his mind
and to save him the embarrassment...
of havin' to tell me,
you know the Bishop, uh,
the Bishop wouldn't hurt anyone,
I put him at his ease.
"Bishop," I said, "the very thing
that's on your mind is on mine.
It's the very thing
I've come to see you about.
I want you to put
young Father O'Malley...
in charge of St. Dominic's."
The Bishop seemed much relieved.
He congratulated me
on my ability to see...
so clearly at my age,
on my ability
to face the inevitable.
Then what happened?
[Sniffling]
Hmm.
That was all.
Oh, Father.
Why can't we go along
just as we have been?
No, no, no.
You're in charge now.
- Sit down.
- No, Father.
- Sit down. I'll familiarize you with...
- There's no hurry.
We can do that anytime, Father.
Well, is there anything
you'd like me to do... I mean, now?
Nothing.
Well, then, if you...
If you don't mind,
I'll lie down a while
before dinner.
All right, Father.
When you and the Bishop
had your little talk,
it was more or less
along those lines, wasn't it?
Yes.
I think you better
start without him.
Looks like he's not
coming down for dinner.
Well, he said he wanted
to take a little nap.
He didn't look well, did he,
when he came in this evening?
Go see if he's awake.
If he's coming down, I'll wait for him.
[Mrs. Carmody]
Father O'Malley!
Father O'Malley!
Father! He's gone.
He's packed his things, everything.
He's gone.
- Where would he go?
- I can't imagine.
[Rain Splattering]
Okay, sure,
but keep at it, will ya?
No, you can't miss him.
A little guy.
Old. Got a grip and an umbrella.
Okay.
Nothin' yet, Father. They're gonna
check the subways, the hospitals.
Look, Father,
take it easy, will ya?
You better go home.
No use the two of us gettin' drowned.
- All right, but you call me
the minute you hear anything.
- I will.
- I don't care what time it is.
- I will.
[Ticking]
[Ticking Continues]
- Shall I make some coffee?
- Huh? Hmm?
Oh, no, thank you.
[Ticking Continues]
Come on.
Now what's the matter?
If you don't mind it,
I'd rather go in by myself.
If you don't mind, I found ya
and I'm gonna deliver ya personally.
That's not necessary.
There's no reward, you know.
It's going to be a little difficult,
and I'd rather explain...
to Father O'Malley
in me own way.
I can do that better
when you're not around.
Okay. But if you want my advice,
you'll just tell him you've been
a bad boy and you ran away
from home and you're sorry.
Hmph. And if you want my advice,
you'll go to church on Sunday...
and say you haven't been to Mass
in ten years and that you're sorry.
[Door Opening]
[Rain Falling]
Hello.
If you don't mind,
I've come back, but only temporarily.
Until me plans
are more formulated,
maybe you wouldn't mind
lettin' me stay.
Oh, I'll...
I'll be no bother to you.
[Sneezes]
Here, Father, let's get out
of these wet clothes,
and get you up to bed, huh?
But I don't expect me old room.
That's yours now.
- Oh, I haven't moved in there yet.
- No, no, I insist.
That's your room.
I'll sleep on a cot, anywhere.
I'll not even be bothering you
for me food. I'll eat out.
We'll talk about that later.
Mrs. Carmody will bring you
something on a tray.
No, no, no, no.
I'm not a bit hungry. I'll...
Oh, come on now, Father,
just a wee snack.
I've been keepin' it
for you on the stove.
Nice juicy cut of roast beef, Yorkshire
pudding and some creamed onions.
Oh, and some asparagus
with buttered bread crumbs.
And golden brown potatoes
and a nice cup of coffee.
We-We-Well, if you insist,
just a small portion
of everything.
Good.
I hope it wasn't too much
trouble, Mrs. Carmody.
- No trouble at all, Father.
- I feel I ought to help
with the dishes.
- [Laughing]
- Don't worry about the dishes.
'Tisn't much washin'
they'll be needin'.
You're still cold, Father.
You were drenched to the skin.
You ought to take a little
something to warm you up.
Do you have a wee drop
of the "crature" about?
Matter of fact, I might have
a little one with you.
I was out myself tonight.
I went out for a paper.
Ah, well, in that case...
- I'll ask Mrs. Carmody
where she keeps it.
- No, no, no.
- Look, look yonder in the bookcase.
- Oh.
No, no, the other side.

Now, would you believe it,

And, Tommy, do me a favor.
Meet Chuck O'Malley.
He's a very old friend of mine.
Chuck, Signor Tomaso Bozanni.
Father. "Chuck"?
Oh, she always calls me that.
You haven't told me yet, Chuck.
Why did you stop writing?
I did tell you in my last letter.
Which letter was that?
I guess that must have been
the letter you didn't get.
You wrote to me in...
in Rome, in Florence,
Naples, Vienna, Budapest.
Then I went to Switzerland,
and I found one of your letters
waiting for me in Lucerne.
Oh, you should have
been there, Chuck.
A week before Christmas and there
was a quaint little post office.
I walked up to it in the snow.
The moon was so bright
that I read your letter on the way home.
And I answered it that night.
But that letter in Lucerne
was the last one I got.
From there
I went to South America,
but there were no more letters.
What happened, Chuck?

Chuck, what hap...
Father Chuck.
It'll take me a little while
to get used to that.
Where's your parish, Father?
I'm over here at St. Dominic's,

- Oh.
- You remember... remember Timmy?
Tim O'Dowd?
Yes, of course, I do.
He's at St. Francis now.
He's a priest too.
Oh, dear old Timmy.
Can you imagine that?
Well, I'll have to be running along.
Oh, please, please don't go. Tommy,
he can stand in the wings, can't he?
- It would be a privilege.

You know, Tommy...
Father O'Malley was the first one
to tell me I could sing.
[Laughing] Maybe one day
I'll tell her the same thing.
If she listens to you, Father,
maybe you could persuade her...
to listen just once to me.
Watch the baton.

[Applause, Cheering]
[Applause, Cheering Continues]
- You wanted to see me, Father?
- Yeah, yeah.
Mrs. Quimp here,
good woman that she is,
has come here with a bit
of disturbing information,
and I think it should more properly
be brought to your attention.
Nice work, Mrs. Quimp.
What is it?
Suppose you tell Father O'Malley
in your own words.
You'd better tell him, Father.
Huh? Ah.
Well, your little songbird
who was without funds...
but not a bit interested
in general housework,
is feathering her nest
in her own manner.
And if Mrs. Quimp's observations
are correct, a very fine manner it is.
It seems, Father O'Malley,
that the young lady in question...
has an apartment
directly across the street.
Yeah, opposite, opposite
Mrs. Quimp's bedroom.
And according to Mrs. Quimp,
young Ted Haines comes early
and stays so late that...
Mrs. Quimp is losing
a lot of sleep.
It's queer, isn't it, Father?
Young Haines was ready
to throw me out...
without so much
as a "How do you do?"
But when it comes
to this young lady...
and mark you, there are other words
I could call her...
he acts quite different.
Don't you think it's strange?
That's a question.
People do funny things, you know.
Fine goings-on, Father.
It's as plain as the nose on your face.
- The nose on whose face, Father?
- Huh?
- Huh?
- Well, it doesn't matter
whose face it's on.
- Oh.
- You and I have got to face it.
Excuse us.
This is a very serious business,
Father O'Malley.
As you're more familiar with the case,
I think you should handle it.
I'll handle the little sins.

- [Knocking]
- Come in.
- [Carol] Hello, Father.
- Hello, Carol.
- Hi, Father.
- Hello.
- I heard you. That's more like it.
- Thank you, Father.
Maybe it's because I'm putting
more meaning into the words.
Hmm. Very nice here, isn't it?
Very nice.
- Before you go any further...
- You mean it's all in my mind?
That's right.
Yes, I'm sure Father is just dying
to hear more of the details.
- Huh? Won't you sit down?
- Yes. Uh-huh.
I was going down the street,
minding my own business,
when who do you think
just happened by...
and pulled up
alongside of the curb?
Ted Haines, Jr.
Right. And what do you think
his approach was? You tell him.
[Laughing]
I prefer not to remember.
Well, being a woman, I do.
His exact words were,
"Hey, good-lookin', what's cookin'?"
- [Clicks Tongue, Whistles]
- Oh, now wait a minute.
What I really said was,
"Who do you know that I know?"
You know, that's worse.
- Well...
- Well, that was that.
And with no more than that,
he asked me to lunch.
Who knows? It might have worked.
It's been known to.
So after I'd cooled him off,
I came back here.
No job, no money, expecting
to be thrown out any minute.
There was a knock on the door,
and I said to myself,
"The landlord. Here it comes."
- And who do you think was there?
- Junior?
- Right. I was so surprised.
- [Laughing] So was I.
Well, up to here, we're...
we're all surprised.
Before throwing me out,
he had to know a little about me.
So in a few well-chosen sentences,
I gave him the details.
Sort of like I told you.
And you found a landlord
with a heart of gold.
Well, not exactly a heart
of gold, Father, but...
Well, we had the apartment vacant,
and it seemed a shame to throw her out.
What's wrong with that?
Nothing that I know of, up to here.
Well, as I was saying,
it was a shame to throw her out.
Like Mrs. Quimp?
Yeah. No!
Well, that's different.
I can see that, obviously.
She told me about coming to see you
and that you wanted to help her.
You don't have a corner
on helping people, do you?
And besides, I've practically
got her lined up in a job.
Yes, and as soon as I get it,
I'm going to pay him back.
Every nickel of it.
You too, Father.
Oh, no hurry about me.
Rather a nice-looking piano
you have here.
Well, she needs one, doesn't she?
- She's got to practice; she's a singer.
- It was very thoughtful.
Of course, pianos are
a little expensive these days.
[Laughs] I asked her first
if she couldn't play a ukulele.
- Well, then naturally...
- Yeah, naturally.
- Carol tells me you can play, Father.
- Oh.
How about trying this one out
and see if I got a good buy?
Yes, play something for us, Father.
- Would you mind us asking you
a few questions, Father?
- No.
Where'd you get
that wicked left hand?
Well, I've always
been interested in music.
Used to write a bit of it at school.
I had a little band.
- We used to play for the school dances.

quite a decision to make:

songs or go my way.
Any regrets, Father?

out of helping people...

- No, no.

Nice thought.

Isn't it?
He's quite a fellow.
Good morning, Father.
- Good morning.
- I'd like to present
Miss Genevieve Linden.
- Jenny, this is Father Fitzgibbon.
- Good morning, Father.
- How do you do? Huh?
- She's a singer.
Oh. Lookin' for work?
Oh, no, no, Father. She sings
at the Metropolitan Opera House.
Well, now, it's a great privilege
to meet you, Miss Linden.
- You've come quite a ways in the world.
- Well, I, l...
- Traveled extensively?
- Yes, quite a bit.
- Ah, and where's your home?
- Well, I just bought
a home in Long Island.
- Well! A nice home?
- Very lovely.
In that case, you'd be interested in
a crazy quilt. We're rafflin' it off.
Again? Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- We're tryin' to raise
a little money, Father O'Dowd.
- I see.
- How many?
- I'll take them all.
How much are they?
Uh... be $10.
- Thank you, and I hope you win it.
- Thank you.
And I hope you win it too, Jenny. Then
perhaps you'll donate it to our church,
and we can raffle it off
over there all over again.
- I'd hate to see that crazy quilt
leavin' the parish.

- Where's the Pied Piper
and his merry little men?
- Down in the basement.

- Oh, now wait a minute, wait a minute.
I'm glad to see you've kept up
your interest in music, Father.
Are you writing anything anymore?
Oh, yes. I have
a little song here now...
that Timmy's going to take to
a publisher, a very good friend of his.
And if he likes it, that might be
the answer to all our troubles.
I have bad news for you. I've been to
the publisher. He wasn't interested.
Wouldn't even look at it.
Said they were loaded up.
May I see it?
- So you're still in trouble.
- Wouldn't even look at it?
- Oh, he glanced at it.
- What'd he have to say?
- "Schmaltz isn't selling this season."
- What are they buying?
- "Barfola."
- No, I think they call it "Voffala."
Yeah, Voffala.
Boy, I heard some of their song hits.
"It Was Hut-Sut Time
On The Rilla-Rye."
And then there was another one.
I couldn't understand the words.
This fella lost his girl
in Salt Lake City.
- Then he goes on to say
the altitude is 5,400 feet.
- Interesting.
The average temperature, 73.
The section is noted for gold,
silver, copper, grain.
But that doesn't make any difference to
this fella, because he's lost his sugar.
- Voffala.
- Well, I know what Voffala is. It's:

I've been in a blue heaven

- She came in on a moonbeam.
- That's a lie. I had you followed.
That wasn't cricket, Dad. When you
were my age, I didn't follow you around.

Everything I say kills her.
It kills me too. Do you realize
this is one of my apartments?
Oh, yes.
I had it redecorated.
- And that's one of my robes.

Oh, I'm going to like him.
Do you know I could have you
thrown out of town?

about her you don't know.
- She was picked up
on the street by the police.

Maybe we know something
that you don't know. We're married.
Married?
- Oh, I'll have that annulled.

You can only get them annulled

Young woman, do you know

You know he's quit his job?
Oh, that's all right.
I'll support him.
Sure, she's working.
You... You'd live off your wife?
Well, Mother was a big help to you,
wasn't she, until you got on your feet?
That was entirely different.
I made something of myself.
Yes, Dad, you certainly have.
Look, son.
My boy.
Have you no family pride?
Uh-uh.

You've certainly slipped, my boy.
You've lost everything.
I don't think so, Dad.

Mm-hmm.

Well, darling, I guess
I'd better get dressed.
L... I think
I'm a failure as a father.
I don't think so.
Darling, where's my hat?
Oh. I'll get it.
You'll have to forgive the way
we've been acting today, Dad.
We were a little hysterical.
I guess we were both
a little, well, mad.
Well, I'm mad too.
Quitting his job like that.
Running off and getting married.
I don't know. This younger generation
doesn't seem to have any sense...
So long, sweet.
God bless you.
Good-bye, Dad.
That plane you gave me
did the trick.
When they found out about
my 600 hours in the air,
they said,
"Okay, Bud, we want you," and, well...

Father. Our catalog is full.
Oh, now, now, now.
Wait a minute.
I've been to a lot of trouble
to arrange this.
So grab your hat and a taxi
and get right over here.
Yes, now!
This very minute!
If you don't, I'll put
the Irish curse on ya. [Laughing]
Good-bye, Father.
That's Father O'Dowd,
a friend of mine.
- What did he want? A donation?
- No.
Pal of his has got a song,
and he's plugging it.
And what a plug.
He's grabbed off the Metropolitan
Opera House with the full orchestra,
conducted by this fellow,
uh, Tomaso, uh,
whatever his name is,
the star, Genevieve Linden,
and a choir of 30 voices.
All this fuss to put over a song
written by a pal of his.
And they're waiting
right now for us at the Met.
- At the Metropolitan?
- Can you imagine such a thing?

I'll quit.
Take 50 cents.
No, no, no, no.
Take it out of
the ladies' sodality.
They never keep any books.
You suppose I could buy
Father O'Dowd one too?
- Must we?
- I can get two nice repaints
for 50 cents.
Give him 50 cents.
You oughta come along with us, Father.
You don't have to play.
- Just go around.
- Me? Ahhh, no.
- The fresh air will do you good.
- You can be our kibitzer.
- Your what?
- Kibitzer.
- What, what's a kibitzer?
- A sort of over-the-shoulder
quarterback.
[Laughing]
- Will you come?
- Well, now, a little
fresh air might do me.
- We'll get a ball for you too.
- Of course.
Plenty mushrooms around here.
Well, where did that go?
Right there.
Now, let me understand.
If you get the ball in the hole...
- in less hits than Father O'Dowd...
- I win.
Yes. So you've got to count
the number of blows?
That's right, Father. Step aside.
He's gonna play now. Careful.
How many did you have?
Three, huh?
How many?
Well, that's remarkable.
Remarkable.
- Can you do that every time?
- I've been known to miss, Father.
You know, a strong
crosswind or something.
- Here, gimme a holt of that.
- You wanna try it?
Yeah.
Wait, I'll throw a ball
in there for ya. There ya are.
Keep your head down now, Father.
Watch your language.
Father, you holed out!
Well, not bad for a beginner, huh?
- Begin... Oh, you've played before!
- Oh, no, believe me.
That's the first time I ever had a...
had a caddy in me hand.
Well, you better play
and I'll watch then, huh?

[Laughing]
[Laughing]
Ah.
What an extraordinary person.
Isn't he?
[Yawning]
Well, I'll... I'll sleep well
tonight, anyway.
[Yawning]
Think it must be that golf.
Shades of me childhood.
You know, I, I feel ten years younger.
[Chuckling]
- [Coughs]
- You know, I was thinking, Father.
Now that everything
is going so right,
before something goes wrong,
you oughta take a little time off.
To do what, for instance?
Well, like, for instance,
take a trip home and see your mother.
The interest is all paid up-to-date,
and unless something
goes wrong, I have plans...
that'll take care
of the next payment.
You really think
it would be all right?
I mean that you'll take...
Father Fitzgibbon! Chuck!
The church is afire!
[Fire Bell Ringing]
[Fire Bell Ringing]
Don't worry, Father.
We'll build again.
- Can I help you, Father?
- No, no, it's all right.
I-I can manage.
It's, it's for the birds.
[O'Malley]
Oh.
They're used to coming here.
- I don't want them to go away.
- No.
Oh, you see, Father? They're
not leaving. Nobody's leaving ya.
And when your church is rebuilt,
they'll all be back.
- Everyone will be back.
- In the meantime,
you can send your congregation
over to my parish.
I'll split the collection
with ya, fifty-fifty.
Take it, Father.
Now what makes you all so hopeful
that the church will ever be rebuilt?
- Here, you're supposed to take this.
- Nah, no, I can't.
- Come on, please, Father. Take it.
- No.
If you'll take it,
I'll take some too.
- There, now that wasn't so bad.
- Oooh!
Don't you try it!
Doctors! Medicine! Huh!
What I need is
to be up and about.
Being up and about
is what's got ya down.
Trampin' all over the parish tryin' to
raise funds! How much did you collect?
There's no need for you
to rub it in.
Thirty-five dollars and 85 cents.
- Yeah.
- How much is the doctor's bill?
Forty.
Says here to take two.
We wanna get our money's worth. Here.
Listen. There's nothin' in that bottle
that's going to do me any good.
Oh, Father. Now you're
not gonna lose hope, are ya?
Hope?
You know, Chuck,
when you're young, it's easy...
to keep the fires of hope
burning bright.
But at my age, you're lucky if
the pilot light doesn't go out.
I know, Father, 45 years
of your efforts in ashes.
Here, take this.
That'll keep
the pilot light burning.
Yes, it ought to.
Tastes like it had kerosene in it.
[Laughing]
Well, did you make
your parish calls?
Oh, yes. Mrs. McGonigle's rheumatism
is kicking up again.
I told her to bury a potato
out in the backyard.
- That's for warts.
- That's what she said.
And I heard
Mrs. Quimp's new gossip.
- Oh. What else?
- And then I went...
to see Carol and Mr. Haines.
Oh, did they hear from young Ted?
Oh, young Ted has
been wounded in Africa.
- Oh, too bad.
- They're shipping him home.
Fine, upstanding young fella.
- Maybe they'll decorate him.
- No, I doubt it.
Some friend of his
ran over him in a jeep.
But I've got some good news.
I have a letter from Miss Linden.
Miss Linden. Well, now, that's
very nice. And where is she?
She's in St. Louis.
And here it comes, Father. I gave you
that medicine to quiet your nerves.
Tony and the boys are with her.
They're on a concert tour.
- They're on a what?
- Now I had their parents' consent,
- and they'll be back
in time for school.
- But you...
Besides, travel's a great education.
If they make enough money,
it's gonna build you a new church.
- Yeah.
- Not much of a one, maybe,
but something to go on with.
Miss Linden sent you a check...
with her love.
Oh.
Thirty-five hundred dollars!
How's the pilot light burning now?
It's burning brighter, Chuck.
It's a long road back,
but we've started, huh?
You know, I've a feelin'
that St. Dominic's may rise again.
Sure it'll rise again.
You know, I think
I'll get up meself.
No. Now you better stay there
and get some rest.
- I feel better.
- No, but you don't feel near that good.
- Now, now, now, now. Here now, boys.
- [Chattering]
Go on home.
Go on away with ya now.
Your dinner's ready.
Go on, go on home.
- Bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Bye. Bye.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Bye, Father.
- Good night, boys.
- Good-bye. Good-bye.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good-bye, Father.
- Good night.
Fine girl, Miss Linden.
And very thoughtful, very generous.
Let's close this up.
Keep the sawdust out, hmm?
That will lend beauty
to the dedication.
And at Christmas,
you and the choir will be able to...
Father, I won't be here
at Christmas.
- Huh?
- Well, I was with
the Bishop this afternoon,
and he's transferring me
to another parish.
Oh, you're leavin' me.
Well, now, it never occurred to me
that someday you might.
But, me boy, what am I
goin' to do without you?
- You didn't ask to?
- Oh, no. No, Father.
As a matter of fact,
I asked to stay with you,
but the Bishop asked me
to help him out, and l...
Well... St. Dominic's.
What's going to happen?
Well, you'll be
all right, Father.
I wish you could've heard some of
the things the Bishop said about you.
Says you're looking
ten years younger.
He has all the confidence
in the world in you.
Don't worry.
You'll have a new assistant.
I want to wish you
all the success in the world,
which I know you'll have.
Is it a parish of your own?
Well, no, not,
not exactly, Father.
You see this, uh, this church,
St. Charles, it's, uh...
Well, the Pastor's
getting along in years...
- and things aren't...
- You mean they're in trouble.
Yes. And I'm supposed
to go in there and...
- try and help...
- You mean without, uh,
the old fella knowin'.
Uh-huh.
Well, now, that's
a difficult assignment.
But it'll work out.
You may have trouble
with the old man at first.
He may be runnin' off
to the Bishop every few minutes,
but don't let that bother you.
You'll bring him around
to your way of thinkin'.
- [Bell Ringing]
- Well, there's dinner.
You know how to manage
these old fussbudgets.
Take him out
on the golf course.
- Get him out in the fresh air.
- You bet.
We'll get along.
Just, just so he,
- so he, uh...
- Knows enough to come in
out of the rain.
That's it! That's it, Father.
That's it exactly.
[Chattering]
[Bells Tolling]
- [Knocking]
- Come in, Tony.
Hi, Father.
So you're really leavin' us, huh?
Yes, I've got my orders, Tony.
I guess when the Bishop says
you gotta go, you gotta go.
- That's right, Tony.
- Sometimes I think I don't like bishops.
Well, Tony,
bishops are like umpires.
You have to have them
to call the close decisions.
- Oh, really?
- I got a little Christmas
present here for you.
I want you to take
my place with the choir.
From now on, you're in charge.
Oh, that's swell of ya, Father.
It's a great present.
- I always had my eye on it.
- I thought you did.
- When you gonna give
Father Fitzgibbon his surprise?
- Shh.
Not so loud.
Later on in the church.
- Those boys haven't told anybody?
- Not a word, Father.
And if they did, I'd kick the...
I mean, I'd be disappointed in 'em.
I guess I'll get goin'.
I know there's a lot...
you wanted to tell me about
takin' your place with the gang,
but I'll make it easy for ya:
I'll be everything
you want me to be.
If ya don't, I'm gonna drop you
like you was a hot potato.
- It's a deal. Good luck to you.
- Good luck to you.
So long.

I'm sure that the way to say
what I'd like to say...
will occur to me
after you've gone.
We're separated by many years,
Father O'Malley,
which could be the reason why
we haven't seen eye-to-eye...
in many instances.
But though we've had
many differences,
we never differed
in fundamentals.
- It was only in method.
- But, uh, never in our hearts.
- Good stuff, huh?
- Oh, yes.
- Good-bye, Ted.
- Good-bye, Father.
Bye, Carol.
Right man did come along, see?
Yes, but not past our house.
Oh. Stubborn, huh?
- Good-bye, Mr. Haines.
- Father.
- Uh... [Clears Throat]
- Hmm?
Pardon me, Mr. Haines.
I've just left the Bishop. He told me
to report to Father Fitzgibbon.
- I'm taking your place.
I'm the new curate!
- What?
- [Laughing]
- No.
- Come on, come on.
You've little time. They're waiting
at the church to say good-bye.
All right, Father.
I've been doin' you a lot of good here.
You're gonna have
a new church after the war.
Yes, but we didn't
raise enough money.
Mr. Haines is gonna give us
a mortgage to take care the difference.
That's right, Father.
He convinced me I have a heart.
After all, it wouldn't be
a church without a mortgage.
- That's right. That's right.
- He's a wonder.
I don't know what I'm going
to do without him.
I don't know who the Bishop
is going to send in his place,
- but whoever he is...
- Uh, uh, Father.
[Whispering]
Right behind you. Father O'Dowd.
No.
Congratulations to you, Father.
[Laughing]
Ah, no. The Bishop
wouldn't do that to me again.
- Yes, he's done it.
- [Laughing]
Mr. Haines. Nice of you to give
that mortgage to the church.
- Oh, not at all.
- Can't tell you how much
we appreciate it.
As you know,
we're all going
to miss Father O'Malley.
He was a fine man.
This is Father O'Malley,
the man who sent for you.
How do you do, Mrs. Fitzgibbon?
I've heard so much about you.
Now it's good to see you.
[Fitzgibbon]
I think you'll agree with me...
that we're all a little better
for havin' known him.
He was always
thinking of others.
And that, you know,
can make life very beautiful.
- Believe me, it's what
we do for others that...
