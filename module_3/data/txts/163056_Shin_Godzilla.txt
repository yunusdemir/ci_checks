SHIN GODZILLA
Tokyo Bay off the coast of Yokohama
Offshore of Haneda Airport
A pleasure craft has been spotted adrift offshore of Haneda.
Japan Coast Guard Patrol Boat PC16
Roger that.
Pleasure craft confirmed.
No apparent hull damage.
The "Glory-maru"... MJG-15041.
Requesting owner information
Boarding the vessel.
Hello. Anyone here?
No one on the flying deck.
No sign of life.
Some personal effects.
No traces of an incident.
Perhaps a fall overboard?
Vessel's vacant.
We'll prepare a tow.
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Aqua Bridge
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Aqua Tunnel
Wait, wait, wait!
Prime Minister's Office, Chiyoda Ward
Fifth Floor Hallway
1st report from intelligence and research.
The Aqua-Line has sprung a leak.
Water's pouring onto the auto lanes.
A liaison office is up,
and an emergency order issued.
And the PM?
 Arriving in 28 minutes.
I need info... downstairs.
Yes.
First report confirmed at about 8:30 a.m.
Leak in the Tokyo Aqua-Line tunnel,
near the 2.5 kilo marker.
Seawater entering from a fissure in the tunnel ceiling.
Several cars involved.
Crisis Management Center
Hamanami Coast Guard personnel are
caught in the steam cloud in the bay.
Executive Meeting Room
Aqua-Line's closed both ways.
Coast Guard is issuing alerts.
Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
Status, Mr. Koriyama?
Koriyama, Crisis Management Supervisor
5 confirmed collisions in the tunnel.
Earthquake damage?
We're checking.
Oki, Deputy Director (Japan Meteorological Agency)
Any relation to the sea eruption?
Not enough info to say yet.
We have heli footage!
Yusuke Shimura, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary (Ministry of Defense)
An underwater volcanic eruption?
If so, it's anomalous.
Coast Guard 691 reporting continued steam eruptions.
Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line Wind Tower
Japan Coast Guard Super Puma 225 MH691
The churning water prevents undersea visibility.
We'll need a unified initial response
Let's reorganize.
FDMA disaster force is in place.
3rd Regional Coast Guard HQ
has sealed the bay.
No sea or air access.
A coastal evacuation advisory has been issued.
Umihotaru Parking Area
Please evacuate the premises immediately!
Follow police instructions
and evacuate to Kisarazu!
Tokyo Bay Aqua Line Aqua Tunnel
 Holy crap!
 Tunnel's leaking!
Watch your head!
Cool! A slide.
Aqua Tunnel Evacuation Slide
Stay calm.
Heading to first aid.
Aqua Tunnel Evacuation Passage
This place is awesome.
My feet hurt.
Awesome! I'm getting scoop footage.
What? What's that noise?
Something's up there.
This is bad.
It's freaking me out
What's that?
Something's here.
Crisis Management Center Conference Room Stairs
The PM has returned.
Fifth Floor Hallway
Aqua-Line rupture is unconfirmed.
Prime Minister and attendants
Never mind the details. Any fatalities?
 No.
Then leave it to the guys below.
There's secondary disaster risk.
I've canceled your meeting.
There's a briefing in five minutes.
 Understood.
Fifth Floor Office
What are the cases for it being some undersea thermal discharge?
Briefing for the Prime Minister
Sekiguchi, Minister of Science
An unidentified nuclear sub meltdown?
Hanamori, Minister of De fence
Impossible. The bay is too shallow for a submarine.
Yanagihara, Minister of Transportation
We believe it to be a magma steam.
A new undersea volcanic eruption.
 Excuse me, Minister Yanagihara.
The epicenter is shallow
and appears to be just steam.
We're confident it's not volcanic activity.
 Really? Then tell me sooner.
A new, large hydrothermal vent?
That must be it.
A vent directly above the tunnel?
Past geological surveys rule that out.
Kanai, Minister of Disaster Management
An oversight, perhaps?
Prime minister.
Something's on the sea floor.
Seiji Okochi, Prime Minister
Some "thing"? Like what?
A colossal creature.
There's even footage online.
Preposterous. A big whale spouting?
The sea is boiling. What creature has
a temperature over 100 degrees?
Kono, Minister of Internal Affairs
We've been scouring online videos.
We've yet to find any conclusive evidence.
Azuma, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Time is a wasting. How about a process of elimination?
Right. A new volcano or a large thermal vent.
What else could it be?
Then let's plan our basic response.
Can we hold a cabinet meeting,
Mr. Prime Minister?
Of course.
Let's move to the main conference room.
Yaguchi.
You'll have to toe the line on their decision.
Don't stir things up.
Shouldn't we consider every possibility?
Hideki Akasaka, Aide to the Prime Minister (National Security Officer)
It's good to be a rebel, but think of the guy who got you here.
Got it? Word of advice.
Fourth Floor Conference Room
All those injured in the tunnel are receiving care.
Conference regarding the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line incident
Fireboats and helicopters are mobilized in Tokyo Bay.
Satomi, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries, is absent on a trip to Australia.
They stand ready to respond.
Regarding to Tokyo Bay coastal region...
...we're at evacuation preparedness level.
Due to possible debris and ash,
we're grounding all flights out
of Haneda until further notice.
Forgive me. Correction.
The grounding of all flights out of Haneda
is unavoidable to ensure citizen
safety over economic concerns...
 Later
As for the undersea
volcano-induced tunnel flooding.
fortunately, no toxic gasses have been detected.
Teams from the Archaeological
 Agency and the Coast Guard
are en route to conduct a
thorough investigation of the cause.
Eruption activity is
reportedly dying down rapidly.
Is it over?
No big deal, I guess.
 Mr. Prime Minister. I beg to reiterate...
...the presence of a large marine creature...
...as a possible cause.
Yaguchi. This is no place for jokes.
This is a ministerial meeting. Minutes are kept.
Don't make mockery of it.
With no time frame for restoration,
we can expect those losses to swell.
Sorry! We must suspend this meeting.
The television. Turn on the TV!
It's unbelievable!
I've never seen anything like it.
What was that?
A tail?
Yes, It's a tail.
Yaguchi's joke may be a serious thing.
Let us adjourn this meeting. All ministers,
assemble in the Prime Minister's office.
So what the hell is it?
For now, we only have
"Giant Unidentified Creature."
We're making a list of biologists and scholars
from universities and research organizations.
We'll hold an emergency summit
to figure this thing out.
Make haste. We need to know.
Yes!
Mr. Prime Minister.
Perhaps we should focus on our response.
Yes, of course.
Yes, but this is unprecedented.
I think the choices are simple.
Do nothing. Let it go.
Or capture it, exterminate it,
or just chase it off.
Kabira, Minister of Finance and Foreign Affairs
I vote for extermination.
I concur.
Hayama, Secretary of Economic Industry
Look at the costs incurred already,
with the tunnel,
the grounding of flights and
indefinite closing of Tokyo Bay.
I, too, favor extermination.
The sooner, the better.
Right, Defense Ministry?
Matsumoto, Supervisor of Defensive Operational Policy
We've prepared for a
wildlife-based threat before.
But never with Self-Defense Forces
using weapons in Tokyo Bay.
Why blow it up? Can't we just chase it off?
Academic circles and environmentalists.
They're already calling for it's live capture
as a valuable new species.
No, extermination's the answer.
A few torpedoes?
The use of weapons requires
careful examination of options.
I, too, side strongly with
the option of live capture.
Start gathering intel on
the unidentified creature quickly.
Extermination, capture and expulsions.
Who are you addressing?
Hiraoka, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary
Vapor cloud spotted near the Tama River!
It's moving?
It's alive, isn't it?
Tama River mouth, Tokyo Bay
The creature's off Haneda Airport Runway D,
entering the Tama River!
Report of flooding on the Bayshore Expressway.
Not again!
Forget capturing it.
Anzai, Prime Minister's Secretary of Internal Affairs
Sir. Biologists are starting to arrive. Only three so far, but...
Fifth Floor Reception Room
Emergency Academic Conference regarding Giant Unidentified Creature
Dr. Shiga, paleontologist
It's indiscernible from TV images
whether it's some dinosaur relic
or a species of whale.
Dr. Yanagi, marine biologist
It seems to be a never-before seen aquatic species.
But I can't say without an examination.
Dr. Hanawa, biologist
First is whether the footage is real.
If I were to rush to judgment.
based on unverified evidence...
...I'd lose credibility as a biologist.
The conference is wrapping up.
Fifth Floor Secretary's office
This is ludicrous.
Asahi Bridge on the Nomi River, Ota Ward
What a waste of time that was.
I agree.
 Damn their status. Get me someone
who knows something.
Yes, Sir.
Shimura, any ideas?
A smart Environment Ministry friend
from college, but she's low ranking.
Fine. Call her.
Hiromi Ogashira, Ministry of the Environment Deputy Chief, Wildlife Division
Serpentine with auxiliary ambulation.
Gills make it aquatic, but has legs like a lungfish.
If it has legs, can it come on land?
Yes. It's a possibility.
Really? What then?
Frankly, we haven't determined
which agency it falls under
Our scholar says that fin-like feet...
 would be crushed under the creature's weight.
So coming ashore is
physiologically impossible.
It's already supporting its weight.
Is that so?
What's your view, Environment Minister?
Kikugawa, Minister of the Environment
Forgive the deputy chief's poor decorum.
But as your experts concluded,
coming on land is very improbable.
I see.
Sir, considering the damage wreaked thus far...
the sooner we hold a press conference
to calm the public, the better.
But Sir, If I may.
Please take care to give only
verified information.
Understood.
Prepare my uniform.
New Nomi Bridge, Nomi River, Ota Ward
First Floor Press Conference Room
The Aqua-Line and Tama River have sustained significant damage.
The creature is currently moving up
the Nomi River.
We're yet to identify what sort of
creature it is.
But we don't expect it to come
on land.
Should it beach itself in the shallows...
we believe it would be crushed to death
under it's own weight.
I repeat.
There is no danger of the creature coming ashore.
 Please set your minds at ease.
Sir, excuse the interruption.
It has?
Kamata, Ota Ward
Hurry! Hurry! Run away!
No danger of coming ashore, huh?
Underground Access Hallway
Now what? I just got proven a liar!
You weren't supposed to go off script!
I needed to reassure the public clearly.
We're asking the experts how
it came ashore.
Screw them. What's happening out there?
Sir, we need to set up an emergency disaster
control headquarters.
Understood.
Conference regarding Emergency Disaster Control for Giant Unidentified Creature
This cabinet council is now adjourned.
 Let's get to work.
Fourth Floor Hallway
So much red tape.
Every action requires a meeting.
That's the foundation of democracy.
Even to hold a press conference?
We have set up emergency
disaster control headquarters.
to combat the large unidentified
creature that has come ashore.
 We are crafting a full-scale response
to secure citizen safety,
including coordinated evacuation
with Tokyo federal government agencies...
The creature's heading toward Shinagawa.
At a speed of about 13 km per hour.
It moves slowly for it's size.
It can trample through Tokyo in 3 hours.
The city is dense and brittle.
We're looking at enormous damage.
We must exterminate it now!
It's a densely-populated area.
We must evacuate people first.
Have MIC and MILT set up evacuation
zones and transport.
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building
Disaster Control HQ, Ninth Floor
We've got orders from the PM to conduct evacuation measures.
 Kozuka, Governor of Tokyo
What took so long?
 Nothing in the first response manual
applies here.
Just expedite an evacuation plan
on the fly.
We've never drilled for this kind of thing.
Tahara, Vice Governor
A city-wide evacuation
will cause a general panic.
Citizens will
have to self-evacuate.
Kawamata, Vice Governor
We'll make every effort
 to control traffic.
 Onchi, Superintendent General
Highway Fifteen, Shinagawa Ward
Traffic signs are out of order.
Please leave your vehicles and follow police guidance.
The Tokyo Government has ordered
a full evacuation of Shinagawa.
All residents are required to
evacuate immediately.
Hurry dear!
 At this rate, the city will be in ruins
Contact the Public Safety Commission.
We can request Self Defense Forces
for pest extermination.
And use of weapons?
Interpreted as an armed
attack under Article 76...
Self-defense troops can use force.
This doesn't qualify as an armed attack.
Article 76 stipulates "by an
aggressor country or equivalent."
It's no time for semantics.
Only the SDF is equipped to respond.
That means soldiers engaging in urban combat.
That will give the Prime Minister pause.
We need an integral response
that involves both...
military force and civilian evacuation.
Declare a state of emergency.
Right now, our only extralegal measure
is mobilization for defense.
Only the Prime Minister can decide that.
You're talking...
a declaration with no precedent.
We'd be mobilizing the country for war.
The police can't handle an evacuation
of this size.
But if we mobilize...
there is a likelihood of collateral damage.
I don't want that.
Can we get the US to kill this beast
under the Security Treaty?
No. Our government and SDF must move first.
Even under the Treaty,
the US can only provide support.
 We're facing a living organism.
Aggravating it might only lead to more damage.
Yes, it's an organism.
That means we can stop it.
Unlike an earthquake or a typhoon.
Protecting citizens is our top priority.
It's a tough decision, Sir,
but to prevent further calamity...
...your authorization is needed.
Right this instant?
Are you serious?
Time is precious. Your decision.
Moment ago, the Prime Minister...
declared a national state of emergency...
calling for the first ever
mobilization of the Self Defense Forces.
And first post-war military action
since World War II
As an emergency "pest extermination",
the order preempts diet approval.
 Nerima 1st division has been dispatched at Tokyo's Request.
Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building A (Ministry of Defense)
Underground Command Room
They're tasked with guiding rescue and evacuation efforts.
But they're not equipped for battle.
Atsushi, Chief of the Ground Staff
Attack helicopters are the most expedient.
Contact Kisarazu base.
Ozawa, Chief of the Air Staff
Shall we deploy F-2's from Misawa?
 No. Any civilian casualties could destroy the SDF forever.
Hamada, Joint Staff Commander
Let's minimize firepower.
Kitano, Chief of the Maritime Staff
But we don't know its strength.
I think we need to be ready.
Yajima, Joint Staff Deputy General
I agree. Let's recommend an integrated, 3 force operation.
Call the PM.
The joint force will be lead
by the Eastern Army.
The goal, extermination.
With ground troops focused on evacuation...
 Zaizen, Joint Staff General
rapid response helicopters will be
our primary attack force.
Sir, as it's in the city, some elderly
and infirm may remain.
 That's why I can't make a decision
without an inspection.
Under such conditions, a little
collateral damage is unavoidable.
Sir, it's not easy.
But we need a decision.
Understood.
Ground Self Defense Force Kisarazu Base, Chiba Prefecture
This is a risky, unplanned mission.
Call for volunteers?
No, standard rotation.
This is what we signed up for.
Fourth Anti-tank Helicopter Unit, Second Flying Squadron
Ground Self Defense Force AH-1S Attack Helicopter
Kisarazu lift off 13:08. ETA 13:20. Over.
Underground Access Elevator, Prime Minister's Office
What a relief. The creature may be big,
but this ought to do the trick.
Maybe we can rebuild the town with it's carcass.
Minister Yanagihara.
Wishful thinking and armchair theories
by the old Imperial Army in the last war
led to 3 million Japanese lives lost.
Beware of unfounded optimism.
Kitashinagawa
Please watch your step. Remain calm.
Get away from here quickly!
Local evacuation centers are useless.
Tell us where to send people!
The creature's progression has stopped!
Stopped?
Why all of sudden?
Incredible.
It's evolving.
Shinagawa Shrine
Kitashinagawa Station
Yatsuyama Rail Bridge
Attacker 1, this is CP. Over.
Copy CP, Attacker 1. Over.
Head to holding area 2 to await further orders.
Ashida, Second Flying Squadron Commander
Attacker 1, copy.
Second Flying Squadron Gunner
It's not like we were told.
CP, this is Attacker 1.
Target differs from report.
Attacker 1, hold your position.
Await instructions.
Resident evacuation is complete.
Understood.
Minister, we're ready to open fire.
Understood.
Mr. Prime Minister. On your command.
Very well. Go ahead.
Attacker 1, commence fire on the creature.
I repeat, commence fire.
Copy CP. Commencing fire.
Target straight ahead. Aim for the head.
Distance 300. Ready, aim...
Hold your fire!
Why aren't they firing?
Ground Self Defense Force OH-1 Scout Helicopter
 Civilians near the line of fire!
Surveyor
Fourth Anti-tank Helicopter Unit, Kisarazu Base
Civilians present. Can we fire?
Joint Task Force Central Command, Camp Asaka
Civilians present. Can we fire?
Ministry of Defense HQ, Central Command Post
Civilians present. Can we fire?
Crisis Management Center Conference Room, Prime Minister's Office
There are civilians. Can we proceed?
Can we proceed with firing?
Mr. Prime Minister!
Abort. Abort the attack!
Civilians must not receive fire!
Attacker 1, abort attack.
To holding positions. Over.
Copy CP. Abort! Holding positions!
The creature is again on the move.
Breaking through the expressway,
 is headed towards Tokyo Bay
Ota Ward
All flights are canceled.
New fire outbreak in Shinagawa.
Most train lines running.
Pledges of support from overseas...
 ...more supplies and aid workers...
The Tokyo Exchange is open as usual...
The bullet train is operating
shuttle services from Shin Yokohama.
Scientist envoys from France
 and other nations have arrived.
The creature has not been
spotted in the Uraga Channel.
So the search zone is expanding.
The casualty count is up to 100 as a result of...
Fires in Ota Ward have been put out.
Disaster Management Minister
Kasai leads an envoy
to survey and assess the damage.
Giant Unidentified Creature disaster site, Ota Ward
Government Damage Assessment Team
It was only ashore for about 2 hours, and look what it did.
No.
We had as long as 2 hours to mount
an initial response. Disappointing.
It was a surprise. Can't be helped.
Everyone did their best
in the circumstances.
Don't get smug, Yaguchi.
It's time to meet the press.
Mr. Minister, this way.
Understood.
Sagami Bay, Oshima Island vicinity
Maritime Self Defense Force Takanami-class destroyer Onami DD-111
Rotary Wing Patrol Helicopter SH-60K
Dipping sonar
We believe it submerged to the
 sea floor off Kanaya.
We're strengthening surveillance...
and patrols around Chiba and Sagami Bay.
But if it's hiding in Sagami Trough,
detection's moot.
Who knows where or when it'll emerge?
How are preparations?
GSDF Camp Asaka, Nerima Ward
Once spotted, a rapid land strategy at water's edge will be difficult
Joint Task Force Central Command
We'll need multiple plans
for a landing point encounter
and expeditionary pursuit.
Yamaoka, Eastern Commander
Samejima, Eastern Director of Defense
I'll get right on it.
Coordinated artillery, tanks and F-2 scenarios.
Third Floor Entrance Hall, Prime Minister's Office
Defensive operations lean heavily on the Kanto area.
Cabinet Press Conference
The metro area has to take priority.
Looks like a 5th floor order.
What about the regions?
13 million people, GNP of 85 trillion yen.
That's 17% of the total.
And in the Kanto region? 40% and 200 trillion.
Seems like a prudent strategy to me.
Protecting a country isn't easy.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office, Fifth Floor
They've set up a special response team in the PM's residence.
Fujinose restaurant, Akasaka District, Minato Ward
 And I hear you were appointed its bureau chief.
You're rising in the world.
Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director & Cabinet Minister of State for Special Missions
I want you to pick the team. You know bureaucrats.
Shuichi Izumi, Vice President of the Liberal Democratic Party
I'll round up people who'll speak their mind to the PM
Yeah. People with balls.
I'm Tachikawa.
Takeo.
Ready, lift.
Second Floor Conference Room
Giant Unknown Creature Crisis Management Headquarters
I'm Rando Yaguchi. We'll operate as a flat organization.
Forget about titles and seniority.
Speak freely here.
That's it.
I'm nominally in charge, but we're
a crack team of...
lone wolves, nerds...
troublemakers, outcasts...
academic heretics and general
pains-in-the-bureaucracy.
So do your thing.
Mori, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare Bureaucrat
Here are the basic specs.
Find out what you can.
Is this all?
Yup. We have to fill in the blanks.
If you have info, please share it.
Yesterday's "council of experts"...
were too baffled to conclude anything.
Hazama, Johoku University biologist
I put together a simple profile.
It's shown us 3 configurations.
More mutations coming.
There's more?
Yasuda, Basic Research Promotion Division Chief
We're analyzing a sample of its body fluid at our lab.
Pass some to me.
I'll get outside help.
The U.S. took all the remaining samples.
Sodehara, Joint Task Force Lt. Director General
On-site remains are being burned due to stench.
Komatsubara, Foreign Policy Director
Under American pressure, I hear.
Then we leave the analysis to you.
 And from Behavioral Biology?
Behaviorally, it just seems to move.
Can't determine intellect.
I think communication with it is unlikely.
Tachikawa, Director of Nuclear Power
Simple question. What's its energy source?
It needs an enormous amount of energy.
Not just to move, but metabolically.
Oxygen conversion in its digestive tract
wouldn't be enough.
All that energy.
Nuclear fission?
Sense of humor, Ms. Ogashira?
That's impossible.
Yokosuka Bay, Kanagawa Prefecture
A US carrier is leaving port?
We heard that Yokosuka City's radiation
monitoring alarm went off.
I'll check with the Nuclear
Regulation Authority.
Monitoring Department, Nuclear Regulation Authority, Minato Ward
I have orders not to go public yet.
But radiation levels in the metro area have risen.
Like a leak somewhere? A reactor?
Negishi, Nuclear Regulatory Authority Monitoring Manager
We've not found a leak at any of the nation's reactors.
Then where's it coming from?
Is that possible?
This data shows radiation spikes
matching the creatures path.
Look here.
See?
Miss Ogashira was right.
Sorry.
"Why's the radiation meter reacting?"
This information is already
spreading publicly.
Contact the Chief Secretary Cabinet.
Chief Cabinet Secretary's office, Fifth Floor, Prime Minister's Office
This is trouble.
The PM needs to call a press conference.
Morito, Secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary
Without proof it's radioactive,
we might end up stoking public fear unnecessarily.
It's not enough of a spike
to warrant evacuation.
There are no legal grounds to it.
It's still a matter of radioactivity.
The sooner, the better.
That's right. I'll meet the press.
Let me talk to the PM.
Schedule a Prime Minister's
briefing. Five minutes.
Japan-US heads of state conference call
Yes, President Ross, I understand. Thank you.
A lot of unilateral requests.
Typically American.
An Assistant Deputy chief to the US President.
wants a secret meeting with the PM.
They move fast.
Yeah.
He just left Yokota Air Base.
Foreign Ministry's in a uproar.
I hear his aide made an appointment with you.
With me? Why?
 Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy
I read your administrations reports.
I need a person I can work with.
With an interesting history. That's you.
I'm honored, but I think you want Prime Minister aide Akasaka.
He turned me down already.
I need a favor that won't stain my record.
I want you to find someone.
Who may that be?
A man who foresaw your creature's
appearance several years ago.
Interested? We know he landed in Narita 7 days ago.
Goro Maki.
Japanese. Former college professor.
I hear your intelligence agency is first-rate.
What's in it for us?
A trade. We gathered intel you might want.
But let's keep it bilateral, okay?
Just US-Japan, so, win-win.
Understood. Let's get to it.
Thank you. I rushed to Yokota straight
from a party, so I didn't ha time to change.
Where's Zara?
Kayoco Anne Patterson.
She's very young.
America admirably values performance
over age.
And she's Senator Patterson's daughter.
The one behind the Kern Agreement. Formidable.
A mixture of talent, pedigree and coattails.
Not really your type, I suspect.
Nope.
If she unabashedly uses her father's connections...
...she's the political type, like Yaguchi.
Tokyo Central Government Building Two, Chiyoda Ward
Commissioner-General Secretariat, National Police Agency
Searching for an individual at a time like this?
For Rando Yaguchi.
I owe a great debt to his father.
As many agents as you need.
Sawaguchi, Commissioner's Secretariat
This is his profile.
Motobe, Criminal Affairs Director
A rebellious elderly professor once expelled from Japan.
Although a biologist,
he worked at a US energy firm.
Interesting old man.
A red notice?
No. Just locate him.
The NSA or CIA will take it from there.
Discreetly, I hear.
His last whereabouts.
My grandma's country sure works fast.
But he's gone missing.
The Coast Guard found his boat adrift at sea.
Ms. Patterson.
Were you looking for him? Or this?
Yeah, that too.
"I did as I pleased. You do the same."
His last words?
Confirm the contents?
No need.
I trust you.
Special ink. Can't be copied.
I'll take photos to share with my team.
Godzilla?
That's right. It's the DOE's
code name. "Godzilla".
He gave it an English name.
Gojira.
What does it mean?
I got one hit.
On Ohdo Island, where he's from,
it means "God incarnate".
A violent one. I hear that's
why he put "God" in the name.
In Japanese, the name read "Gojira."
"Gojira"...
...you say?
Who cares about its name at this point?
It's just as well it originated in the US.
Now we know what to call it.
The government is unofficially
calling the giant creature "Gojira."
National Diet Building Gardens, Chiyoda Ward
Goro Maki?
Ex-biology professor at Jonan U.
Find out who he was.
You'll get an exclusive when
the time's right to go to print.
That's a promise.
Hayafune, Freelance Journalist
Yes, I know.
Sixty years ago.
So this is all about unregulated
dumping of radioactive material.
Don't tell me...
Gojira fed on these.
Yes.
That's the DOE's conclusion.
They sent requests to various institutions
to analyze the containers.
Dr. Maki was the main figure.
Suddenly, an ancient species of marine life
found itself surrounded by radioactive waste.
And rapidly mutated into an
organism that could withstand it.
That's his Godzilla theory.
But it's body lengthened when it came ashore.
Yes.
It can suddenly mutate,
from sea organism to land.
This new Godzilla surpasses
anything I imagined.
This is all the information at my disposal.
What comes next...
Personal service.
What Dr. Maki left behind.
I can't make sense of it.
It's not a molecular array.
How does it relate to Gojira?
Perhaps an analytical table of structural layers.
Dr. Maki intentionally left out some final data.
We now have the complete version.
Do you mind if we analyze it?
Sure.
I'm bad at Japanese honorifics.
Can we go informal?
Okay, then tell me...
What does the US want with Gojira?
Study or exterminate?
That's for the president to decide.
Who decides in your country?
Prime Minister's Signature
Cabinet Approved Victim Relief and Reconstruction Bill
Fourth Floor Hallway
Finally a cabinet decision on the relief and recovery bill.
The Gojira bill, too, will be
an interagency nightmare.
Lack of precedent will cloud orders.
Expect a lot of passing the buck.
At least the security bill passed easily.
Second Floor Hallway
Foreign Ministry muscle, under US pressure.
The US wants to use its Gojira
info as a diplomatic card.
Let's pray our crafty Aide Akasaka
can handle the White House.
Results of the disaster site analysis.
Gamma rays match no known elements whatsoever.
It's incredible... Gojira, is it?
Its body harbors new elements.
This is why the US Dept.
of Energy moved so quickly.
Let's take this data with us. Call the PM.
Understood.
More troubling complications.
So...
...how much do we say?
Having fully analyzed substances
recovered from Gojira's path...
...radiation of 0,5 microsieverts
 in the stricken area.
Thanks for the food.
Yes, thank you.
Even with the information the US shared,
I feel gridlock coming.
Yeah. Riken's report had impact.
Gojira has eight times
the genetic info of humans.
It'll take years to sequence all of it.
Gojira's the most evolved
 creature on the planet.
Capable of self-mutation. Not generational.
That trumps human intelligence.
It's still mortal. It can be killed.
I sure hope so.
That's what we're here to find out.
Any clues into its behavior?
It just walks
Why did it suddenly decide
to return to Tokyo Bay?
I got it.
Cooling.
Gojira has something of a
nuclear reactor on its body.
Its fins are heat vents,
meaning it has a blood-cooling system.
 So it retrogressed to sea creature temporarily
to adjust its body temperature after mutating.
Maybe our only hope is to shut down
its internal cooling system.
Forcing Gojira to do a
reactor scram to stay alive.
Rapid cooling may not kill him,
but could immobilize him.
Machida, METI Manufacturing Director
Like administering a blood coagulation drug.
Is it possible with Gojira upright?
We'll examine practical methods.
Perhaps a compression pump.
We, the health ministry and METI,
Takeo, MLIT Disaster Management & Transport Safety Deputy Director
will gather the necessary coagulant and equipment.
Submit it to the PM as the "Yaguchi Plan."
Understood.
Name aside, let's get on it.
"Godzilla is God!"
"Save Godzilla!"
Good morning, Tea?
Thank you.
Thank you!
I think we all could use a break.
Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary's office guests
Everyone is collaborating voluntarily.
They don't go home to rest,
not even when they are asked to.
And if they do, they come back early
 with warm food for everyone.
It's very inspiring.
None of that jurisdictional
infighting among ministries.
Just people working together.
A lot of outsiders have tirelessly
volunteered their time, too.
You're right.
There's hope for this country yet.
Truly.
One question, though.
When did you last change your shirt?
To be honest, it smells a little rank.
Really?
A shower would do you good.
Gojira has resurfaced in Sagami Bay!
 And it's coming ashore!
Cape Inamura, Kamakura City, Kanagawa Prefecture
J-Alert! Broadcast that Gojira has come ashore!
Primary alert over Em-Net transmitted!
This is Kamakura Disaster Prevention.
This is an emergency evacuation order.
A colossal-sized, unidentified creature
has come ashore.
Everyone is urged to
evacuate the city immediately.
Repeat. Evacuate immediately.
Please follow the instructions of
police and fire personnel.
The Prime Minister.
Gojira is moving towards Kamariya.
Am I crazy or has it gotten bigger?
Beyond expectation.
Different face and body.
Yes. His size has nearly doubled.
Gojira's evolved into it's fourth form.
This will be disastrous.
Yokodai, Isogo Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture
Citizens, take refuge indoors!
 This area is under curfew.
You are in the designated evacuation zone.
 Your attention, citizens!
Gojira expected to reach Tokyo in three hours.
Tsukuda, Minister of Justice
Why's it coming here again?
Ogimachi, Kawasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture
A direct armed assault on its body
runs the risk of releasing radioactive material.
Preventing its progression
 into the metro region is top priority.
I hear it lives on radioactive material.
If it attacks a nuclear facility,
it'll spell a worse disaster.
Prime Minister.
We must stop him now.
And we don't want to be
viewed overseas as timid.
How goes your Yaguchi Plan?
Regrettably, it's not ready yet.
Give the order and the SDF will do its job.
The declared state of
emergency is still in effect.
You have...
...the power to order the attack.
Sir.
I know.
Commence.
Yes, Sir.
Contact command.
Yes.
The order's come through.
Assume unrestricted weapon use.
We are to do whatever it takes
to keep Gojira out of Tokyo.
Operation B if it rises at Kanagawa.
Make Kawasaki the primary battleground.
And Tama River as the absolute defense line.

I'm sorry we couldn't even halt it.
Don't lose hope.
It's our job to protect the people.
An offensive isn't the only way.
Speed up evacuations.
The operation failed.
Gojira is back on the move.
The SDF's full power was futile.
Incredible self-preservation ability.
If standard weapons worked, we
wouldn't be here.
A perfect organism surpassing Man.

Target is entering Meguro Ward!
Let's petition US troops for aid in taking it down.
From the American ambassador.
The USAF confirms bombers on their way.

Submit a formal cooperation request.
I'll meet with the ambassador.
I'll hold a press conference on the subject.
We've requested aid by US forces in Japan
In fighting Gojira based on the
Japan-US Security Treaty
The proposed US bombing zone.
It's this large?
It'll be worse than Gojira.
We'll need to evacuate people underground.
Atagoshita Avenue, Minato Ward
The US military will launch an attack on Gojira.
Evacuate to subways and
underground arcades!
Sengaku-ji Station, Asakusa Subway Line
Don't push!
This residence is in Gojira's path.
The SDF failed to stop it.
The US military may also.
Are you saying evacuate from here?
Yes. Other key functions, too, must go immediately
to a secondary facility in Tachikawa.
The US strike is about to begin.
I have a duty to stay and monitor its execution.
I can't abandon the citizens to make my escape.
Mr. Prime Minister.
You can leave because you've the nation to protect.
Please evacuate.
Tokyo city hall is still functioning.
For now, let Governor Kozuka take charge.
Understood.
2 helis will arrive on the roof.
We'll go by car.
Okay. Go ahead.
It'll take some time.
Traffic will be murder.
We'll meet later.
Okay. I'll crawl if I have to.
A mandatory evacuation order has been issued.
Please vacate at once.
Sotobori Avenue, Akasaka, Minato Ward
Gridlock. Traffic's not going to move.
The strike is coming.
We need to get everyone out.
So that's Gojira.

How much radiation has Gojira released on Tokyo?
Don't wait for the government.
Decide here.
I hear radioactivity is high.
Will they distribute iodine tablets?
Nuclear, biological and chemical response
teams are being deployed.
For decontamination and rescue.
The Prime Minister, Cabinet Secretary

Deputy Chief Yaguchi!
I'll call back.
Mr. Izumi.
I'm glad you're safe.
To think that going home on Friday
saved me.
You're injured. You all right?
Sorry. Bandages are in short supply.
That's okay. No big deal.
Tokyo is directing fire and rescue.
No Internal Ministry.
Let the police handle refugees.
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Operation Room
They'll survive one night.
Rumors will fly, so get a jump on the press.
Provisional HQ Staff Room
I need information. Where's Gojira?
Inactive near Tokyo Station.
Who knows why.
Radiation levels?
The Nuclear Regulation Authority
personnel are busy getting readings.
Gojira's dripping radiation from its mouth...
but only trace amounts.
Hisamatsu, Nation-First Party Deputy Chairman Public Secretary
Its plume blew out to sea...
but contamination is widespread.
The hard-hit wards are uninhabitable.
On top of being contaminated.
Well conditions are pretty grave...
We lack manpower, materials and
legal infrastructure.
They're all dead.
The Prime Minister, Chief Cabinet
Secretary, everybody.
Don't go to pieces!
We'll make do with the survivors!
Yaguchi...
Calm yourself first.
I'm sorry.
Who's the acting PM?

So a man with factional seniority,
and whose loyalty made him a minister,
is now the Prime Minister.
I hear it was foisted on him
by the party secretary.
Who wants responsibility at a time like this?
Director's Office, Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ, Tachikawa City
Some disturbing movement near Tsushima Island.
Kazakoshi, Executive Secretary to the Prime Minister
I suppose we'll have to wait and see.
Can the Foreign Ministry act?
Katayama, Acting Foreign Affairs Minister
We're still getting up and running.
At any rate, just try to avoid
unforeseen surprises.
I'll let the ambassador know.
Yusuke Satomi, Acting Prime Minister
The noodles got soggy.
I knew this job wouldn't be easy.
Satomi is a hard man to read.
Whoever the PM, our job's
to keep the ship afloat.
We need an emergency legislation.
We're only 30 kilometers
from where Gojira's sleeping.
I'm not worried about that anymore.
This country's good at
quickly picking a successor.
You next?
No way.
I'm thinking 10 years.
If Japan's still around, run for office.
I'll support you... in exchange
for a party secretary post.
Akasaka was at Yokota, so he was saved.
A politician needs strategy and luck.
Now he's Chief Cabinet Secretary.
You could be more ambitious.
The Disaster Bureau is a unique path, though...
You're practically in charge.
Rando Yaguchi, Deputy Director, Cabinet Minister of State for Special Missions & Giant Unidentified Creature Unified Response Task Force HQ Bureau Chief
No, I'm here to take the fall, if needed.
Akasaka's a shrewd delegator.
You're the next new aide
to the PM on a career track.
What's wrong with that?
Why'd you become a politician?
'Couse it's just friend or foe.
I like the simplicity.
Bureau members have arrived.
Special Disaster Bureau Provisional HQ Office
It's great to see you all.
Over half of our team has returned. Thank you.
Our hearts are heavy for those we lost.
Let's do it for them.
We'll fill their positions.
While we struggle
with the lost of colleagues and loved ones.
We can prevail!
For our countrymen.
I ask you to pour heart
and soul into completing our work.
I beg you.
Let's get to work!

How's the freeze plan going?
Private companies are working on

One of them should work.
How about samples?

We've asked GSDF to retrieve some living cells for us.
GSDF Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle
Roger that.
Samples retrieved.
I'll send them to BSL4 labs.
Good
Remainder to any P3 level lab,

GSDF Central Nuclear Biological Special Weapon Defense Unit Eleven
Shift change.
Yaguchi.
Arriving in 5. Secure us a meeting
with the acting PM, will you?
Is that right?
Is that right?
Yes. There's a movement
centered on China and Russia,
to take Godzilla from under the
control of the Japanese government
and put it under the control
of international organizations.
Many countries are aligned
with that opinion, too.
However, as for the US government,
we strongly hope
that Japan and the US can
perfectly control Godzilla together.
Hideki Akasaka, Acting Chief Cabinet Secretary (Former Aide to the Prime Minister)
Ok.
From the government point of view,
it is for that reason that we would
agree to a 2-plus 2 cooperation.
However, as army experts will remain
as the backbone of the government.
We have to respectfully decline your offer
to remain at the center of decision-making.
In place of that, we will...
A US-Japan Gojira research coalition?
The more knowledge, the better.
Lets clear some space.
Nice to meet you. I'm Rando Yaguchi.
US GODZILLA Joint Research Team
From GSDF's latest unmanned surveillance system.

It appears that Godzilla has something like a built in phased-array radar.
So it can instinctively intercept
approaching objects.

Squad 2, this is CV1.
5 minutes from point zero. 10 minutes remain. Over.
Copy that, CV1.
Cross-referenced field data
with Tsukuba's...
this may be how Gojira plans to propagate.
Rapid colonization all over the world.
So not only could it evolve to a smaller size...
it could sprout wings capable of
intercontinental flight.
Let's go
And that will mark the end of the human race.
Before that happens, using our nuclear wisdom
is the only road for salvation for mankind.
Are you serious?
Tama Monorail Operation Base, Tachikawa City, Tokyo
The Defense Secretary thinks
its best to hit Gojira...
with a thermonuclear blast.
And the White House?
A report cites a 13% chance of Gojira
landing on the west coast.
The UN Security Council has set up
a multinational Gojira strike force.
The US is serious.
Afraid so.
They say Gojira has to be hit with a nuclear missile.
The Pentagon's already moved
to set explosive yield...
and burst level for a B83 warhead.
To be dropped on Tokyo?
I was ordered to evacuate.
I see.
So it's highly likely.
Yes.
But I'm not returning.
I won't see a third bomb...
dropped on the country of my mother,
who live trough it.
Japan-US heads of state conference call
Certainly. We'll act accordingly, President Ross.
Matsuzawa, Minister of Foreign Affairs
Certainly, we'll act accordingly
that way, President Ross.
Well, you heard it.
That country foists some crazy things to us.
That is certain.
But this goes too far!
I agree.
Call the Chief Cabinet Secretary.
Yes.
The UN Security Council has
passed a resolution...
for a US-led force
to exterminate Gojira.
As party to the resolution and participant...
our nation will be under its command.
In other words...
I'm going to need a special law...
vesting the Prime Minister with full powers.
Authorizing...
the use of a nuclear weapon on Tokyo?
I didn't want to go down in history
for anything like this.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
From here on, Gojira comes
under US-led, UN jurisdiction.
Post-War Japan is a tributary state.
"Post-War" extends forever...
You mustn't give up.
No creature can withstand
the million-degree heat of a nuke.
As a sure method of extermination,
it's the right choice.
We're on the edge of a breakthrough...
with our freezing method.
Your plan still has too many unknowns.
Plus, all countries have pledged their support.
to a complete rebuilding effort if we sign on.
If we can't kill Gojira with certainty...
...we lose the world's trust.
We must put our fate in the UN's hands.
My job is to think about what to do for Japan
after Gojira has been destroyed.
Right now the damage is limited to three wards.
They can be rebuilt.
The city's economy is in a free fall.
If bonds and stocks continue to plummet...
The nation with go into default.
Japan needs international sympathy and funding.
Scrap and build, huh?
To save the country.
There's no other way.
Yaguchi.
This is the reality. All else is just a dream.
A thermonuclear bomb?
Dropped here?
We just gave the UN its sanction.
Unbelievable.
How do we know it hasn't
made itself immortal?
The choice is incinerate with a nuke;
or freeze with a drug.
Yes, that is a choice.
But not a good one.
Man is more frightening than Gojira.
The UN coalition will of course
give time for evacuation.
That's our window for finishing.
We got something that worked well
on the samples.
Now comes production.
To freeze all of its blood...
we'll need 672 kiloliters of coagulant.
I'm securing facilities as we speak.
Can we make it?
We have to!
Don't give up.
Don't abandon this country.
Ask every private chemical company you know...
to open every line possible.
I'll send all pertinent data.
Ask everyone to finish production by tomorrow.
We're getting broad cross-checking.
Spreading knowledge works.
Logistics for police and MLIT to ship the coagulant
I'll do that.
I need METI to coordinate pump makers.
If we agree to buy them...
Shanghai will give us 3 tank trucks.
We need 5 more wheel loaders, any size.
Ambassador Lansing
just reported coalition projections...
that Gojira's energy beam...
will be restored within 360 hours to previous levels.
Shuichi Izumi, Acting Special Advisor to the Prime Minister
The creature is likely to resume activity in 15 days.
I see.

Cartland, US Army Colonel
The start time for the nuclear strike
against Godzilla has been decided.
Countdown will begin in 5 minutes.
Paine, US Forces Commander
So it's too late to turn back now.
Lansing, US Ambassador to Japan
Japan has been given a two-week grace period in order to
in order to evacuate remaining residents.
That may seem long for the Allied Forces,
but it's too short for Japan.
Evacuation means uprooting people
from their beloved homes.
Don't make it sound so easy.
Agreed.
Evacuating 3.6 million people?
Preposterous!
We don't have the manpower.
Not to mention million more in
neighboring prefectures.
The governor protests the sacrifice of Tokyo.
This is a national decision,
not a municipal one.
Relocation selection and approvals can't happen in 2 weeks.
The moment Gojira resumes activity...
the strike time will move up unconditionally.
Regardless of collateral risk.
A thermonuclear warhead will be launched
from a sub at that time...
as per the coalition decision.
What bull! Easy for them to say
about far-off Asia.
If it were in NY, they say
the same would apply.

Land prices are soaring in west Japan. Food is short.
Kanto area companies and shops are shuttered.
City's full of the unemployed.
The yen's plunge reflects investor fears...
...except from those profiting from it.
People come in all forms.
You have information?
I do. It's my job after all.
How about printing my article a day
prior to the bomb drop?
New Gojira material.
In exchange, we can control
the announcement timing.
How's that?
I understand.
The professor loathed the radiation
sickness that took his wife's life.
He hoped to render radioactive
materials harmless.
If that's possible, so is the creation of a new material.
He must have feared the military.
That explains his redacting the DOE data.
He hated radioactive materials.
And maybe anyone involved with it.
Including Japan, which left his wife to die.
Then he leaves his data and writes,
"Do as you like"?
Strange person.
So what did he do in the end?
Good meal.
Solve the chart yet?
Not even with help from a cryptographer.
Anything from the US?
I wouldn't rely on them right now.
We regard it as important for
a multi-tiered approach.
It resembles a mandala more than
a chemical schematic.
Or working backwards from the solution.
He was a little twisted.
I'm even baffled by its simple lines.
Why did he put it on paper, not data?
Perhaps it's meant to be folded.
With a body like Gojira's...
old radioactive waste must leave it hungry.
No doubt.
Crooked teeth. It can't even prey
on nuclear waste.
Origami.
It's not eaten.
We grasped the entire pattern.
The new information came from making folds.
We focused on radiation as its energy.
This is a molecular chart for
converting elements in the body.
Element conversion molecules.
The unknown radioactive isotope is the proof.
Say hydrogen or nitrogen entering the cell...
where it's converted to necessary molecules.
Gojira's a mixotroph with an
organ that converts decaying heat.
A bold but viable hypothesis.
It can live anywhere there is water or oxygen.
Like an ascetic surviving on mist.
So Gojira's is both a threat to mankind...
but also poses a revelation of
limitless potential.
But then the blood coagulant may be
ineffective inside its body...
killing the Yaguchi Plan.
Possibly. So what now?
we raise certainty of working.
First, analyze this structure, then
a way around it.
I'm having supercomputers run
parallel analysis...
but the results are days away.
We've only got 10.
I asked MEXT to use their
global connections.
Burghead Computer Science Laboratory, Germany
Call from Japan.
They're requesting parallel computing.
We can't.
This is a closed system.
We can't risk our data being stolen.
Come, come. Where's your trust in your fellow men?
Tell them we'd be happy to do it!
Supercomputer cluster
We've solved Maki's riddle!
Here.
Incredible.
It's not the cell membrane itself.
But an extremophile configuration
that inhibits cell membrane activity.
This inhibitor could keep
the blood coagulant viable.
There's still hope.
It looks good.
Okay.
Tachikawa Wide Area Disaster Prevention Base rooftop
I get the feeling Goro Maki anticipated this.
Maybe releasing this destructive God
as a sort of test...
on mankind, this country, we Japanese.
"Do as you like", including the use of
nuclear weapons.
Maybe so.
"Do as you please", huh?
But...
that's hard to do in this country.
It is.
By oneself.
Sir, we're ironing out the last kinks
on the Yaguchi Plan.
We ask your approval to deploy it.
Yes, but Izumi.
A UN resolution is already passed.
Some say that the US seeks a quick resolution
to bury their knowledge of Gojira.
We know that!
And you know our country's condition.
But Sir...
...forcing one country's sacrifice
for self-gain is deplorable.
So you're saying...
...act unilaterally on humanitarian principle.
Perhaps it's time we did as we wanted.
You're right.
So, where do I affix my stamp.

"A strategy to administer a coagulate"
"to freeze and thus render
the creature immobile."
It's long-winded.
What do we call it?
Operation "Yashiori", after the sake
Susanowo used to put a hydra to sleep.
Very well.
We'll run it in 5 phases.
Asaka is working on details.
Vehicle operation...
and explosives drills have
already been conducted.
We're execution ready.
Many thanks.
No need.
It's our job.
Countdown's at 2 days.
Damn.
I still need three days to
make enough coagulant.
Can't the countdown be suspended?
Who in the Security Council can we get to help stall?
Not China and Russia. Too geopolitically close.
How about France? Nuclear country.
They'd be interested in  the biology.
I have a back channel I can use.
Please.
I'll try the Euro Bureau Chief.
And I the Foreign Minister.
We need 24 more hours!
France has petitioned to
interrupt the countdown.

China and Russia are opposed, but we are maintaining silence.
Cussing, US Official
That's because it isn't just hardliners at
the nucleus of Washington and the Pentagon.
Japan has grown up enough
to have international trade deals on the sly.
Dangerous in another opportunity
for personal growth.
Our friends are progressing with
an effective deep freeze plan.
I think this country is betting on it.
And you're rising that bet also, I see.
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent.
I've been trying to advise Charles against it.
But it goes against the flow of the mainstream.
And you and I must bear the risk of retaliation.
Me, I'm ok.
But you, with your fastidious career,
and the Patterson name, mud will stick.
And your dream of becoming
President in your 40s will disappear.
Hey, Kayoko!
Good luck.
Yeah.

Raise the chance of success.
Can our independent commands
be coordinated?
You've made friends.
Lots of Air Force and Marine volunteers.
Even drones if you need it.
What do you say?
I'm in.
But there is no guarantee of the coming back in one piece.
Of course. I'll bill
the Japanese government later.

We scrapped together enough inhibitors.
Quickly send some tankers
to pick them up.

Won't you reconsider accompanying the front line troops?
A political decision may be needed.
And time will be critical.
Too risky. Policymakers can direct from the rear.
You want to be PM in 10 years?
Got to make sure the country's
around in 10 years.
we've got the young talent, public and private.
Like you. We'll have leaders.
You've kept me going. Thanks.
Nonsense. Thank Akasaka's mentoring.
Good luck.
Save me Party Secretary.

In this Operation Yashiori...
there's a high risk of acute exposure
to radiation heat.
I cannot promise that all will be safe
But your work will matter!
Our country's greatest strength
is found in the field.
The SDF is the last fortress able
to protect the country.
Japan's future we place in your hands.
Godspeed.

Excuse me!
Look at this survey data.
Gojira's new isotope has a half-life of 20 days.
It'll be halved in a month,
gone in 2, 3 years.
That's good news for Tokyo residents.
Thank god.
GSDF Nerima Base, Nerima Ward
Good work.
The Satomi cabinet will be resigning en masse.
In line with your scenario?
It wasn't mine. This was all PM
Satomi's scenario.
The capital and government are in shambles.
Good opportunity to rebuild it right.
Once relief and reconstruction bills are passed...
it'll dissolve for general election.
To resuscitate Japan and 3.6 million
metropolitan refugees...
we'll need a brand new cabinet.
This country rose up through scrap-and-build.
It'll be done again.
The countdown was merely suspended.
But it'll restart when Gojira
begins moving.
3,526 seconds to launch.
I'm amazed you allowed that.
I had to keep the world satisfied.
Now Japan... no.
Mankind, must coexist with Gojira.
You shared the data with France.
With France and the whole world.
I broke a promise, but regret nothing.
I like your by-any-means approach.
So...
you'd better not quit
When I'm US President,
you'd be ideal as my Japanese counterpart.
Your Japanese puppet, you mean.
The fact remains that casualties were high.
Accountability comes with the job.
A politician must decide whether
to own it or not.
I myself choose to own it.
Well, as Maki said,
"Do as you like."
But now's not the time to quit.
Things are still far from settled.
