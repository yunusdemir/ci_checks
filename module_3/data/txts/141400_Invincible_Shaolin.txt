My respects, General.
- It isn't a formal meeting
Please stand up and talk.
- Thank you, sir
Did the men from Xiongshan Shaolin come?
- Yes. They're waiting for your order
Should they wait at the practicing hall
or come to see you now?
I've arranged some gimmicks for them
at the hall. Ask them to come here
Ask the 3 masters
of North Shaolin to come
Captain Hua, how do you compare them -
to the 3 masters
from South Shaolin here?
I don't know
whose fighting skill is better
But it seems that they're more humble
South Shaolin is rather discontent
Since they've fought the battle for
the state. The monks did exert their best
But royal court still worries about their
martial power. It could be a threat to the nation
So the court banned civilians
practicing martial art
Shaolin should have been no exception
The court didn't uphold it seriously
Shaolin was asked to select the best disciples
to teach Manchu soldiers martial skills
But Shaolin just delivered randomly -
the secular disciples from Guangzhou
It's really ridiculous
So I requested the court to ask North
Shaolin to select the disciples again
My move has a deeper meaning
The masters from North Shaolin are here.
- Please
They're the masters
from Xiongshan Shaolin
I'm Pao Sen Tsao
Su Fong.
- Yang Chung Fei
My respects, general.
- Thanks for coming here
Please have a seat.
- Thank you
You're selected by the Shaolin.
You must be good at martial arts
I hope you will give our soldiers
good lessons
We'll try our best.
- I hope you understand -
Shaolin practicing martial arts
is actually an offence -
but the court is generous
The Ming dynasty
military department's ex-chief -
had an agreement with Qing on surrender
It stated that the women, the dead
and the monks won't be subjugated
Even though it's true for monks
however you 3 aren't monks, right?
We used to have 3 masters here.
They're from the south Shaolin
Soon we will go to the practice hall
to meet them
Before that, I need to ask a small favor
No problem.
- Please...
I've been admiring the skills of Shaolin
Can you show me your skills
with these wooden men?
Bravo!
The masters from South Shaolin must
be waiting for us. Let's join them
They're from north Shaolin.
They serve in the army as well
North and South Shaolin lead the martial art
world, but which division is the best?
Today it'd be sort of an eye-opener.
Would you have a duel?
All kinds of skills have the same origin
There's no better or worse.
I think there is no need to fight
It's strange then.
There're always the better and worse
Why is there no need to fight?
Is north Shaolin too weak to fight?
That's not what brother Su meant.
- That really puts me in a tough spot
We need 3 chiefs and 3 assistants
in the army
The winners will be the Chiefs
If you refuse to fight,
the rank cannot be decided
I don't know what other people do
When we're invited,
we're told that we'll be the Chiefs
Then it's better to have a duel.
- Right
Who'd come first?
- Me
Wait!
It doesn't really have to be a fatal fight.
It can be done in a subtle way
Right
I'm Yang Chung Fei. I practice body
lifting skills and 2 sectioned staff
Body lifting?
It's only useful when you've to run
Right. You chase after me.
If you can catch up with me, I'll lose
Come on!
Come on!
You won't make it this way. Breathing
is an important aspect of martial arts
In anger one loses
the rhythm of breathing
You tend to lose in the beginning.
Don't you know this theory?
The north Shaolin
didn't obey the emperor's order
We need the best fighters
How could they send us some lousy ones?
This offence...
Be careful. I'm fighting back
Captain Hua, prepare rooms for the masters
from north Shaolin
You are...
Maybe we didn't learn well enough
We have to leave now.
There'll be someone to replace us
If there're good fighters in south
Shaolin, they will take revenge for you
You are provoking...
- Right...
Putian south Shaolin, Xiongshan north Shaolin.
They're the big threats to the court
I just played a small trick.
- You...
Captain Hua, send the bodies
to their master Mai Qi tomorrow
You know what you should say
Saying that they agreed
not to have a fatal fight
But the masters from north Shaolin
fought seriously and hit them
Then they suffered internal injuries.
No one noticed it
After a few hours, they died!
Dad...
- Master!
The masters died in the duel.
The general felt very sorry
He'll come to offer his respects.
- I really don't know what to say!
Dad, don't worry.
They'll not die for nothing
The south and north Shaolin
are of one family
One family? Why were they killed then?
The general also thought that
they're too ruthless
The general also said if you send
other 3 masters and defeat them;
The Chief posts
still belong to south Shaolin
No need. I wish the abbot of Putian
Shaolin hadn't ordered me;
The court particularly requested
our students to teach the soldiers!
Otherwise I wouldn't have sent them out
Now since the matter has ended up
like this, we won't take the post anymore
But we must take revenge on them.
- Right. A revenge is a must
I should leave now.
- Thanks for coming here
Ah Fong, walk the captain out.
- Yes
Please.
- Goodbye
Dad, I'll take revenge for them.
- I'll go with him
Me too.
- We will go too
Dad, I'll go with brother too.
- Okay
I guess only Yuan, Di Li and Nu Qiang,
these three should suffice
It's about the reputation of the school.
Take on them one to one
Dad, I... - Just in case
your brothers are no match for them;
What can you do?
It's decided. Prepare yourself now
Prepare the coffins
Yuan, Di and Nu, invite them for a fight
The former 3 masters used to live here
If you don't like it,
I'll find another place
The place is nice
but it's a bit strange here!
We didn't hit them hard yesterday.
Why then did they die suddenly?
Right. I feel strange too
There're always unexpected circumstances.
A person could've unexpected good or bad fortune
Our lives are destined.
Who can guarantee the life of a person?
Boxers don't have this kind of taboo.
We will live here
Then I'm leaving now.
Please tell me if you need something
Brother Pao, I feel something wrong.
It's indeed a coincidence!
What do you think?
Us Shaolin students truly dislike any Manchu task
But the court threatened the school
We're sent unwillingly
to teach the Manchu soldiers
We did it for the safety of our school.
We've no choice
Guess it'd be just the same for south
Shaolin. Maybe there's a conspiracy
We've no way to find out now
Let's just stay on
and try to find out the truth
Right.
- South and north Shaolin are one family
At tomorrow's funeral
we'll offer our respects
Apart from this, we actually could also
try to find out why they died suddenly!
Yes. We'll go to pay respects to south Shaolin
Master in order to avoid misunderstanding
Sorry.
- It's okay
You're the new masters.
The general asked me to serve you
Were you outside all the time?
- No, I just came in
Don't worry. He looks fierce
but he's a nice person
I'm Xiu Yin.
Let me know if you want something
Thanks
This is presumably Grand Master Mai!
Oh, I really don't deserve to be addressed
so or that you've come for the funeral
Perhaps my 3 students weren't good enough.
Their death is well-deserved
I'll send other 3 students tomorrow
to have a duel with you
Master, there is no inside information
If we fight again,
it'll ruin our relationship
Whatever it is,
we three don't wish to be the masters
No one wants to be the master of Manchu.
- We want to take revenge
Master Mai.
- Fine, it's enough
If you still stay here anymore, I'm afraid
my students will start the fight
I may not be able to stop them.
Please leave first
See you tomorrow at the fight.
- But...
Tomorrow three of us
will meet you at the general's house
How is it? Should we start now?
- Okay
Wait...
- We come for revenge, not for a duel
If you refuse to fight, I'll start it.
- Let's do it subtly
Whatever you like
Masters from south Shaolin lost last time.
We have to find out who is the best this time
The general will be the judge today
You may start
Both Shaolins are from the same origin.
Please control yourself
Who will fight with me?
Within ten moves,
one who steps backward will lose
Me first
This guy is no match for brother Pao.
If he holds on, he'll be seriously hurt
Let's part them.
- Okay
What are you doing? Trying to outnumber us?
Pal, don't you see your man
can't hold any longer?
We're with good intention,
don't mistake us for bad
Bullshit!
- Hold it!
You fight with me in a long gown;
Are you looking down on me?
Let me try your skills.
Stop when we should stop
Chest bones all cracked.
He'll be surely dead
Our hate is deepened
Master Mai, let's stop here
Brother Nu, excuse me
Looks like the north Shaolin
is stronger than the south
I'm sorry.
- Get up
You tried your best.
I won't blame you
It's Spinning Kicks.
This is Iron Palms
The one fought with me
is called Yang Chung Fei
He uses a 2 sectioned staff
and is good at body lifting skills
He broke my elbow with his staff
This is Butterfly Stick. It's to be used
alongside good body lifting skills
Spinning Kicks, Iron Palms, all of them
are the invincible skills of Shaolin
Dad, we...
- Listen carefully
From now on, I'll close our school.
Everyone go home and see no guest
Whoever makes trouble outside
will be expelled from the school
He'll no longer be taken as a Shaolin pupil.
- Dad... Master...
Enough! If you consider me as your
master, just do as what I said
Okay. You may leave
Nu Qiang...
Dad, it's the blood letter of Nu
3 of them went, but only 1 survived.
- Dad, do you want to take revenge?
Yes, I definitely will.
But we lost the battle twice
The skills you guys have now
are no match for them
It's meaningless to risk lives now.
It'll only weaken our reputation
So I asked them to go home
to avoid further trouble, and bloodshed
Dad, are you...
Shaolin's martial art is excellent
and complicated
The north and south both excel
at different kinds of skills
I hurt myself in a training years ago
I couldn't gather my breath properly now
nor can I condense my real strength
This is the reason I couldn't teach you the best
Lucky that there's a few
south Shaolin Grand masters
They live as recluse to avoid
the threat of Qing court
It may be assumed their skills
would now be refined
What do you want me do?
One who killed your brother is good at kicking.
You must practice to attack his weakness
He's good at longer distance. You aim for
shorter. You need to soften his strong kick
Among the skills of south Shaolin, Yongchun
principle uses softness to tackle strength
There used to be a master named Liang.
Nicknamed "the Gardener"
I want you to learn from him.
- Yes
I'll write a letter tomorrow
and you'll go to see him
At the same time, ask Ho Ying Wu and
Chu Zhangcheng to come and meet me
Masters, you did a good job.
Tea for you
Look at you...
What? Why only him?
Forget it, brother Pao. You're dull.
You're not brother Su
What's the difference?
- Okay
Why don't we get changed
and take a walk
Have some wine
Fresh fruit!
What?
- You ate my fruit
Yes, I did. I didn't deny it.
- Don't take it for granted. Pay for it
Do I have to?
Then why they didn't pay?
The Manchu soldiers are unreasonable.
I take it as feeding dogs...
I know. You're scared of them
Hey, come here!
Master Yang and master Pao,
what's the matter?
Look, you're scared of them. They're
scared of me. They don't have to pay
Of course I don't have to.
- So you're same kind of shit after all
I'm a good human not some commodity.
- Paying doesn't mean you're a good man
What? What are you saying?
It doesn't need that much. Here's the change
If I don't take the change and let you
keep it; Would that make me a good man?
No.
- Why?
You're the chief instructor of Manchu
soldiers. You're the same kind of man
How can you be a good man?
- I see
Didn't expect a little girl like you
to have the dignity of Hans
Brother Pao, tell them our background.
They will know who we are
Tell them? - I hardly expect him to talk.
He's probably unable to talk...
No, he's only...
- You monopolized the talk
Tell them? - Take it easy.
They thought we're not good men
I think these two girls aren't bad
Isn't it a tea house here?
Let's have some tea and talk about it
What's about our veggies and fruits then?
- I've an idea
You go to have tea with my brother Pao.
Let me mind your stall here
That's nice.
Xiu Lin, let's have some tea
Go on
Come on... buy some.
It's fresh. Nice and delicious
What is it again? Worrying?
If I take your stuff away, my brother is
still inside. You may ask him to pay you back
I'm afraid you'd be bored;
I came to keep you company
Don't you think they teach our soldiers
in quite a serious way?
It looks like that.
They teach them seriously
Right. My plan goes well.
Do you get it?
I got it. The hatred between
south and north Shaolin deepens
The court will benefit from it
Right. A few students of south Shaolin
died. Not to mention even Master Mai's son
Mai won't let it end like this.
I'm looking forward to seeing the show
How clever of you, general!
Everything is under your control
Pears... Vegetables... Big and nice...
- Very cheap
Excuse me
It's very sweet
Excuse me
Pears...
- Excuse me
Excuse me.
- Pears...
Are you a fruit seller?
- Yes. They're sweet, want a try?
You aren't a fruit vendor.
- Who says so?
Right. Sweet and nice
Don't you want your bag?
If I were to sell fruit the way you do,
I'll probably starve to death
Ying Wu?
- Master
Have you met with Fong?
- Yes
So you know it.
- 2nd brother told me already
When I see the coffins,
I can't help feeling...
Do you know why I'm asking you back?
- Training and taking revenge
Right. No need to feel sad. Just remember
to practice hard and take revenge
When did you last see Fong?
- 3 days ago
Well, then... Not only he finds Chu,
but also the Gardener
Excuse me, are you the Gardener?
Mr. Liang?
Go back...
- Sir
It's my father's command
that I meet you, grand master
What do you mean 'grand master'?
Don't you see I'm busy?
Sir, I've a letter from my father.
He requested me to hand it to you
Indeed you are Master Liang
You're Mai's son?
Why didn't he teach you himself?
Why do you want to learn Yongchun from me?
- My father has been keeping poorly for years
I didn't learn much from him
My personal enemy who killed my brother
is very strong at kicking
My father said
the Yongchun skill of Master Liang -
can deal with his powerful kicks. And
then I can take revenge for my brother
Mai is a lazy man
passing over his son to me
You might perhaps know;
Yongchun looks simple, -
but it's very tough to learn it well
I'm determined to learn it.
- Okay. Let's see
These vegetables can't be eaten raw
But the girls are not bad...
It's called feasting one's eyes
on a beauty, right?
You didn't pay for it. What do you want?
Don't run away.
- Let me go
Are you asking for trouble, kid?
- Come on
What's the matter?
- That Manchu officer took advantage of me
This man tried to help me
Hey, don't take it wrong
My brother stopped you
because he doesn't want you to suffer
He's not helping them. - This lady is
my brother's friend and a sweetheart
How could he help them?
- Off you go now
The Manchu soldiers will soon be here.
Then you can't run away
They will outnumber you. You want to
take on thousands of Guangzhou soldiers?
There'll be no one to avenge your death,
you know!
He's a very good fighter
A hero!
- Why are you so happy?
Of course. I mean, since I've met a hero
He didn't ask my name.
- You didn't either
Master!
- Come in with me
Did you see it?
- I did
These are the 6 tablets of
your colleagues
I think Fong has told you
what happened here
I want you to practice your skills hard
and then take revenge for them
Master, I'll try my best
Good. Ying Wu will practice with me.
I've asked Fong to learn Yongchun.
He'll use softness to overcome strength
Do you know what is
the most powerful Shaolin skill?
The most powerful one
is the Iron Palms in the north;
Of the south... it's the Mantis style.
Your physique is good for powerful style
Among those three opponents
one of them uses Iron Palms
You need to learn Mantis style
to against him
A well-known Mantis boxer of south Shaolin
is Zhu who takes reclusion for years
He called himself "Woodcutter of South Mountain".
I want you to learn from him
But he's a person of very strange character.
You may have to take some hard time
The revenge is important.
I need to learn no matter how hard it is
Good then. I've written a letter
You leave today for the Woodcutter
and learn from him
Come on
Put off your clothes
Pants off.
- Pardon?
Your physique isn't bad.
Learning Mantis style isn't easy though
A mantis is small but very powerful
Its arms may lift 100 times its weight
Ah, you think your arms are strong enough?
It's far from it
A mantis blocking a carriage'
is a proverb though
When the founder of Mantis style,
Wang Long, studied at Shaolin
He came across a mantis using its arms
to resist a bird which tried to eat it
Then he invented the Mantis style,
the most powerful of all skills
You may acquire it only by hard work.
So you need to practice very very hard
This style is called "Rock Breaking"
It lays emphasis on the power of arms and fingers
When you practice well, you could
break rocks with your fingers
Practice as I've told you
Do it again
Fried egg... not bad
Like the daytime,
you'll have this kind of fried egg
I like fried eggs.
- You're lucky then
Only men can be successors
of South Shaolin
My school being an exception;
Its founder, Miss Yen Yongchun
was a woman
Since my ancestor Mr. Liang learned from
his wife, the school was inherited by a man
Nonetheless emphasis is on the power of
gentleness, not on strong physical strength
We don't fight with big actions,
we win within close distance
Now you start by standing on a pole,
training the steadiness of your lower body
Go on to the pole. The little trick I taught
you earlier, let's see you work on it
First, stand properly.
Horse Feet position
Open your fist
Go on to the pole
Remember; If you can't stand still
on the pole or if you fall, -
you've to do gardening
as a punishment
Mr. Zhu, do you still want fried eggs tonight?
Practice again
Don't you like fried eggs?
This is my dish
Use three fingers
Use two fingers
Use one finger.
- What? One finger?
I've eaten fried eggs for two months.
Can we eat something else?
I can offer you eggs only
Because you've broken these many eggs, you have
to finish them. What can I do with a broken egg?
The contenders use short sticks.
It's flexible to use short staff
You have to get the short stick in the air,
none of them should fall on the floor
Then, you can say you've got it
We are not having fried eggs tonight
This is my dish.
You just broke two eggs today
We really aren't having any fried eggs?
- No
Tomorrow, we should practice
Mo Pan pole array
This is the Mo Pan pole array?
- Right
We practice hip stacking style on it,
a style learned by the mantis
In the North, this is called Resistance Drill.
Firstly, learn to being hit before striking
You've to train your muscles
as hard as rocks, -
so the Jing Gang Palm will not hurt you
Good. Practice like this
Ok. Come down now
Follow me.
- Yes
This is Ping Zi pole array.
Show me the variation I taught you
Be careful. If you step on the flowers,
you have to... - Got it
Strange. It's been a few months.
Why isn't there any aggression in Shaolin?
Mai Qi won't let go that easily.
- I have to find out what's going on
Make sure you don't leave any trace,
try to be a rather more discreet
As regards the 3 masters in the house,
pay attention to what they do
Brother Su, you are busy lately
I'm investigating as to
how the 3 masters of Shaolin died
Weren't they killed by us?
- Second Brother, calm down
So what did you find? It's useless
even if you've found something
You killed Mai Yuan.
I killed Di Li too
I've the feeling; From the time
we went to the general's house, -
we've been set up. We're being controlled
and kept falling deeper into the trap
I found out how the 3 guys died.
All of them got serious internal injuries
The day when we fought
we didn't make any lethal hit
In the general's house, certainly
there must've been a good fighter
He could've killed the 3 guys quietly
thereby shifting the blame on us
What a cruel plan!
I want to find Mai Qi
and tell him what's going on here
Don't go! You've killed his son.
He won't forgive you no matter what
If that person really exists,
you only need to pay more attention
I've been observing the guards and soldiers here.
Their martial art skill is not good enough to do it
Unless it's one of those two.
- Which two?
Mr. Hua or the general himself.
- Are you sure about those two?
We didn't do anything wrong,
we don't have to be afraid
Let's go.
- Where to?
There are two persons urging us to take
you to them. They want to see you
Who are they?
- You'll know when you get there
Your staff skill is getting better.
You've been working hard for a few days
Let's take a day off today.
You may continue tomorrow
Yes, master
This is Brother Su. These two are
the ones I spoke to you about
Miss Chen. Xiaoling
These 2 girls are here in order
to meet you. So they took a day off
Please be seated
Are you a master too? See, what a gentleman
he is, unlike both of you!
Xiaoling, we should find
a nice girl for master Su
Don't bother to do that, Master Su
got someone in mind. - Really?
You?
- You?
You're not really selling fruits.
- Even a fruit seller can have a day off
You don't look like it
It's not easy to sell fruits.
Look at you! You can't even pretend well
A master who sells fruits,
can't really fool people
Master? Master from where?
- The general's house
You killed the 3 guys from north Shaolin?
- That's right. We did it
My guess is right.
You're not fruits sellers
Then who are you?
- I followed Master Mai in Shaolin
The other day when I met you,
I had just came back from the Master
May I have your name?
Excuse me, you're Ho Ying Wu.
- My name is Su Fong
South and North Shaolin used to be one
Mr. Ho, have a seat. Let's have some tea
My master didn't asked me to come here for tea
Among the three,
who's the one skilled in stick moves?
Oh! That's me.
- I use staff, too
I want to see your Butterfly style.
- Too bad I didn't bring my 2-sectioned staff
It seems like you also didn't bring yours!
Forget it
We both don't have the right weapons.
That makes us even
Do you really have to fight?
- It's the deep hatred between our masters...
Even though I do understand when 3 of you
fight together, no one can beat you
You're kidding. It won't take 3 of us
to beat you. Brother Yang, teach him a lesson
We will not fight against you together.
I'd say, you and Brother Yang don't need to fight
This is only a misunderstanding.
- Would you fight?
You think I'm scared of you?
Ok. Stop now
Mr. Ho, please wait,
I have something to say
You've come back? What's up?
What happened?
Didn't you have a fight with someone?
I fought with one fellow, I believe that
guy is the 2-sectioned staff user
You were no match for him, huh?
- Yes
Our staff-skill seems almost equal.
But, his body lifting is better than mine
Only if he hadn't gone easy on me;
I think I couldn't have made it back today
His butterfly style and body lifting
must have been in total accord
Tomorrow onwards
I'll teach you body lifting
Cross your arms
Flip your body
Monkey Move
Good
Since your opponent is strong,
I made these poles for you to practice
Flip, Turn, Duck, Open, Step forward
Roll, Hidden fist, Fist, Fingers...
Excellent. Put these metal rings
on your feet
Nine-step thrust
You must have heard of the saying:
Principle of a single breath passing 3 vital points
Yes, the constant circulation of air
within the body
Not bad.
Now we practice with these stones
First stage
Second stage
Third stage
Good. Let's practice Thrusting Fingers
in that pavilion
Master? - If you want to come out,
you got to fight your way out
You've learned the 3 steps move.
Now you need to change the training method
Mantis Fist is a skill of strength
that squeezes out all your power
It is like a mantis lifting things
100 times of its own body weight
So the style is just superficial
Whether you can defeat the enemy
depends on how much power you generate
Now, for various fist sets,
which you've already understood
So, you need to start from 3 steps move
to increase your strength
Put these on your feet
One step
Two steps
Three steps
One more time
Finished?
To the pavilion
Do I have to go in?
- A weak attack is hard to win
Yongchun is good for
short distance attack
At a close range you've to try
and hurt the opponent
Particularly if your foe is good in using
legs, only long distance will favor him
So you've to attack closely with vigor
in order to defeat them
You think this will work?
Master! Master!
If you practice like this, your body will...
- Put your mind into practice
Go back. Continue your practice
Master!
Brother Su? Brother Su?
- What's up?
There are two ladies.
Why are you here today?
You tell him yourselves.
- Okay. No problem, I'll say it myself
We're here to see your...
We're here to see Xiu Yin
To see Xiu Yin? - They said she'll be
the future sister-in-law
She has to meet her future sisters
Who said I'll...
- What? What is it?
Sister-in-law...
- Ask her to help him?
Okay, I'll help you. Sit down
Where's Xiu Yin?
- She was just here, I'll go and look for her
Xiu Yin...
Oh, you're hiding in Master Su's room!
- Nonsense. I just came from that direction
Come, come.
What's up?
- Someone wants to see you
Miss Xiu Yin is here. Here she is.
Who wants to have a look? Please...
From head to toe. Have a good look.
- Stop fooling around
The two ladies are here. Shouldn't
Master Yang have introduced them to us?
This is Miss Cui Ying.
She will be your sister-in-law
This is Xiaoling. She'll be your sister.
- Man, you sure are witty!
Congratulations!
Master Pao and Master Yang and ladies
However, Xiu Yin isn't good enough for him
What are you saying? A beauty like
Xiu Yin should be a good match for Su
When will we be going to their wedding?
Who is it?
It's me, Master Su.
- Oh, it's the Mr. Hua. Sorry
No problem. Don't forget to invite me
to your wedding with Xiu Yin
It's a happy occasion for the house.
I need to inform the General
He'll be very pleased about it
General, you asked me to stay in
the house to watch over the 3 masters
I've heard one thing today.
- Really?
You sent Xiu Yin, the maid in the house,
to serve the 3 guys, right?
Now she's in love with Su.
They're talking about getting married
Such daring!
- General, from my opinion, -
you shouldn't be angry about this.
You should be happy
Why?
- Think about this, among the 3, -
Pao Sen Tsao is a jerk, Yang Chung Fei -
is like a kid,
the hardest one to deal with is Su Fong
If he marries the maid in the house, he'll be loyal.
He'll even listen to whatever you say, right?
General, at that time even if
the South Shaolin people don't come, -
you just need to ask those 3 guys;
They'll flare up a fight with South Shaolin
It's the same, right?
By doing this, the hatred
between them will be deepened
So without consulting you,
I've already told them
I said you'll gladly consent to their marriage.
- You've done the right thing
If it's like this,
I'll give Su enough respect
I'll take Xiu Yin as my goddaughter
and I'll be the host of their wedding
Good idea, General.
There's no better way to do it
Try again
You can go back to see your father
Mr. Hua has told me that
the General is happy about the wedding
He'll first take Xiu Yin as his goddaughter.
Then as a godfather, he'll host the wedding
What should we do?
Brother Su, I know you saw
Hua Shun the other day -
and you wanted to test
his fighting skills. Am I right?
Yes, that's right.
- But, did you test him out?
He's not the one.
His martial arts is just ordinary
Hadn't he fought back the other day
it'd have been hard to judge him
But, he fought back once.
It's hard to fake it
So, I suggest,
we do what the General said
Yang, our objective was
to fight against Qing Dynasty
The Manchus use masters' safety
as a threat
That's why we're here playing a master
But by doing this, Su will become
the son-in-law of a Manchu
I agree with you. If Hua Shun's
skill is ordinary, -
that killer in the dark
may be the General himself!
But, he is the boss of the house.
How can we find out how good he fights?
This is the only chance to get close
to him and to find out the truth
I think Su must have the same thought.
- My opinion is the same too
I'm afraid it'll be tough on Xiu Yin.
- In this case, there's nothing much we can do
We shouldn't let the trivialities hold
us back. So we'll have to hurt Xiu Yin
Su, let's do it
The Zhu family will have successors.
You've been practicing Mantis Style.
I must say you've improved a lot in a short time
With your talent, you'll become very skillful in it.
Zhu's Mantis Fist will get passed on
You've been here for quite some time.
You can go back to see Master Mai
Father!
- Master!
You guys finally came back.
Fong, help me up
Father, you're not feeling well.
You should rest more
Help me up
Go over and count.
How many coffins are there?
We all know the number.
- Just count!
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Six coffins
Fong... Zhangcheng...
Have you all counted and seen clearly?
You must remember...
They're all your brothers
They died for us.
They were all young
Yuan was the oldest among them;
He was only 27
I haven't buried them yet, because
I want you to kill the 3 enemies
I wish to have a ceremony here.
Then I'll bury the six coffins
I'm afraid I won't be here to see that
Now, I want you to make a oath for them
Father, we'll take revenge
Kneel down...
You two will make a vow.
You won't give up till our enemy is killed
Fong...
- I won't give up till our enemy is killed
Zhangcheng...
- I won't give up till the enemy is killed
Ying Wu...
- I won't give up till the enemy is killed
You have to make a promise,
to uphold the spirit of Shaolin, -
never follow the Qing,
- Uphold the spirit of Shaolin, -
never follow the Qing.
Father! Master!
General, Mai Qi died.
- What?
It was just this afternoon.
I heard he's been sick for a long time
He still taught the students to take revenge.
That's why his sickness got serious
That's why they didn't take any action.
- Now, Mai Qi is dead
His students will be eager about revenge
Let's see if I can add some oil to the fire.
The big massacre will happen in no time
Then I'll go tomorrow also let them
know you'll be a godfather -
and have a banquet the day after tomorrow
It should also be clarified that after being
a godfather, you'll arrange Su's wedding
The South Shaolin people are sure to get angry
From their point of view, they'll think
the North Shaolin has taken enemies for their benefactor
They'll be very angry. I am sure the day
after tomorrow, they'll come for revenge
Good. When the South Shaolin people come,
we'll have the troops ready
First let them kill each others!
- And then we'll get them all
I never expected
master Mai die so suddenly
The General was thinking of coming himself.
But it's busy in the house these days
He has to arrange his goddaughter's
wedding with Master Su
Master Su? - Yes, one of the 3 masters
of North Shaolin
He'll marry General's goddaughter
Excuse me, I'm busy. I'll have to leave first
That bastard!
Brother Ho, didn't you say those
3 men were not the bad ones?
They are Shaolin disciples
Even if the Qing Court has forced them to come here, -
but why would he marry a Manchu girl?
Does it mean that they yield to the Qing?
- I think something is wrong there
But we've taken an oath
and we won't let the master down
We have to kill those 3 men.
- Yes, we should go tomorrow
Before the general gets a goddaughter,
we need to get even with them
My respects, godfather.
- Good. Get up, get up
This is a small gift,
the first gift from your godfather
Thank you. Godfather
Please be seated
Please sit
It's just a small family party,
just for welcoming my new daughter
At the time of her wedding,
we'll have a big party then
Cheers, General
A toast for Master Su and the lady
Cheers. Godfather.
- Master Su should drink too
Cheers, General. - My son-in-law,
don't call me General anymore
Who is it?
- Ho Ying Wu from South Shaolin
Chu Zhangcheng and Mai Fong.
We came for revenge
How dare you?
I mean, it's a happy occasion for you all;
3 of us, the uninvited, to spoil the fun
It's you?
- You?
For what you've done,
don't call yourself one of Shaolin disciples
We're not here for revenge only.
We came to get rid of Shaolin scoundrels
You must be Master Mai Fong.
I think this is a big misunderstanding
Also, it's somebody's trick.
If we can't calm down -
and find out the truth,
only we'll suffer from this -
and the enemies will be happy to see this
Master Su, we met once before.
There're lots of mysteries in my mind too
But 3 of us have made a vow
in front of my master's grave
We can't disobey our master.
The fight today can't be avoided
You don't have to say any more.
Hopefully the truth will be out one day
I think he's right.
Brother Su, discussion is useless now
We're going to fight no matter what
I've met you last time,
but I haven't asked your name
After we've met last time,
I've always wanted to drink with you
We have wine here today, just as I wished.
- Good
I'm Pao Sen Tsao.
I studied in Xiongshan Shaolin -
and Jing Gong Palm is my specialty
My last name is Chu, successor of the Ming
royal family. Mantis Fist is what I learn
Pleasure to meet you.
You're the successor of Zhu Ming
Nice to meet you
Please
You're Su who practices Spinning Kicks.
I came to -
avenge my brother. No need to explain.
Please start
Godfather, they are...
- This is a matter between men
It's none of a woman's concern
They're so unreasonable
I guess it's our turn.
Give me my staff. - Yes
You've brought your staff today?
- That's right. We both have our weapons
It's the right time to learn from you
but I've to let you know first
At this very serious situation, I will fight
with my best. Please don't hold back
Don't go and look at them.
You can't help anyway
You will only distract them,
perhaps making it worse
Body Turning Fist!
Your staff skill has improved a lot.
I couldn't beat you with the bare hands which sell fruit
I've told you already.
You don't need to hold back
Don't treat me as a fruit vendor
You're killing me for your brother
I've made a promise
I'm badly injured now and will die soon
I have to tell you the truth
After the fight with your brother,
I bent and picked up my clothes -
and he attacked me from behind
I defended myself quickly with a kick.
It was too forceful and he got killed
Maybe me and my dad, we're wrong about this
I'll go and stop them
My last name is Chu,
Successor of the Ming
Why didn't you kill me back there?
- There's no hatred between us
Why should I kill you?
- But I thought you would kill me
So... I...
- I know
That's why I only hit your stick
and not your body
Wrong. We're all wrong
Look out!
That's him. That's the style
It's the General
who killed 3 Shaolin brothers
Right. This is what he used
Brother Chu and Brother Mai,
listen carefully
I'm badly injured.
You guys have to leave here
Tell others about the dirty tricks of the Qing.
Please work together to pass on the Shaolin skills
Move out
Let me handle this bastard
Run now.
There'll be no chance to escape later
You...
Why are you guys still here?
My brothers died for you
If you don't leave now,
the Manchus will succeed
Run quickly
You always joke about everything
and actually you're quite a hero
Hero?
You may ask this fruits vendor
how much does a hero cost?
