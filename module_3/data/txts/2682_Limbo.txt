Dear Alice,
my name is Erda
And I am the matron of Limbo
A small and beautiful home
where we care for children
suffering from a disease as unknown
as it is difficult to cure
Unfortunately, in these last few months
we have had a notable rise in fatalities
amongst our children
for avoidable reasons.
We know your great work as a reporter...
and we would like to extend
to you an invitation...
and maybe help us in our fight
against the forces of evil
May God bless you.
- Give me the matte.
- No, I'm not giving it to you.
How long are you going for ?
- Give me the matte !
- No, I'm not going to give it to you.
I don't know yet...
<i>Donne, a few days, two three</i>
Two weeks, who knows.
In the middle of nowhere ?
I'll go with you.
No, and how will you come, and the girl ?
Anyhow, it is work, Euge.
I'm going to show up and just say 'Hi,
I'll do the article with a friend...
In your state you can't disappear
in the middle of nowhere, no.
Why don't you go with Gabriel ?
No, I prefer going alone.
Anyhow, if it's a place where
they treat children
what on earth could happen to me ?
Give me the matte.
It's frozen, this thing.
You found it?
- You frightened me.
- Hey, sorry.
No, stop that.
What are you doing?
- What's wrong?
- You know.
Don't you think we should
come clean about us.
No, this is work.
You can't play around
showing off your girlfriend like that.
What?
I love you.
Yeah, me too, but...
So then?
I asked you for some time, remember.
But I'm going alone.
You don't even want me to come with you ?
- No.
- Why not?
I told you no already.
Let me finish this up.
Yes No
She doesn't want me to come.
...Doesn't want to okay
Yes, I'll do it.
Excuse me.
Sir, I was wondering if you
could give me directions.
I'm going to Limbo.
And Gabriel ?
What ? Gabriel ?
How do you know...
You frightened me.
I've been waiting for you.
Oh yes? You've come from Limbo ?
I've waited a very long time.
Why? I don't understand.
You're very beautiful.
Yes, actually I'm very tired.
It's been a long trip.
Give me your suitcase.
Thanks.
No one seems to be here.
They've already gone out.
Who?
The children.
Where did they go?
It's you, come closer!
Welcome to Limbo!
Did you come straight from your office ?
No, from home.
- How was the trip ?
- Good. A little long and tiring.
- Yes, of course.
- Even strange at times.
I met a man under the bridge.
There are some strange people here.
Strange ?
Siegfried, go join the others.
Ignore him. He's wicked.
My name is Erda.
- Mine's Alice.
- Yes, I know.
Here you will be able to rest well.
The children will be back in
a couple of hours.
Where did they go?
- Sleep well.
- Thank you.
So, what is this disease called?
Yes. Transylvirus.
It's a very unusual virus that
they are still researching yes
Strange, I've never heard of it.
No, no ...just that...
Many of them have it ?
No,no...
it seems to be a Hungarian strain
that was brought here.
This is why we have to live in seclusion
so we can maintain our particular lifestyle.
Of course. Good.
And it's contagious?
No, no
Yes well, yes.
It depends.
Depends on what?
So it's a kind of
photo sensitivity they have.
Yes, that's right. Photo sensitivity.
Something like that.
- You wash them yourselves ?
- Yes.
- You wash your own clothes every day?
- Yes.
Eg er fra lapnia og eg missti
er litia eyja
What lovely breasts you have.
How old are you?
Thirty-three
Aren't you a bit old for that
sort of behavior ?
You remind me of someone.
It's me.
Yes, I know it's you.
Your dad messed it all up.
What do you know about my father?
Your mother didn't love you
and gave you up to those people.
Then she died.
And you, how do you
know all these things?
Can I hug you ?
Are you happy?
What?
Are you happy?
Yes, I don't know. I guess so.
You've got yellow there.
Wipe it off.
Ah!
Yes?
Mister Pan.
Last night Peter went missing.
Peter Pan, like the one who
never wanted to grow.
If you 'll excuse me,
I need to absent myself a while,
to attend to some business.
What is it?
One of ours
has met with his creator last night.
Please excuse me.
This disease is as unpredictable
as it is deadly.
The truth is I am amazed.
Why, dear?
I have to congratulate you.
This place is incredible.
How do you keep it so organized?
What would the children do without you?
Lovely wine.
Maybe a little corked, but it's nice.
I blended some '82,
that balances its acidity.
Why is it called 'Limbo'
Your mother never loved you, did she?
No, my mother had me adopted no
sooner I was born.
She never even breastfed me.
Why?
It seems they couldn't cope
with a hemophiliac child.
How cruel.
Meaning that you and I, and the children,
are the same.
Yes.
Me too.
How I missed you.
I was dying to see you.
What? You don't like that I came?
- What is your name?
- Juanito.
Your face looks familiar.
Is that possible?
Did you do a commercial?
Yes, you know, the one with...
Yes or no?
Sorry.
No, all is fine. Just that
some children seem to behave
a little like grown ups.
Maybe it's the philosophy of this place.
What are you talking about?
The only philosophy here
is God's.
Don't misunderstand me,
everything here seems perfect,
and I love this place.
That everything should be
so free, so easy.
But, ...peace and love for all ages,
I don't think
Here we practice only a strict
Catholic morality.
And those who dare stray from path
of God's straight path
will forever lose the way to salvation.
A little biscuit?
No, thanks.
- I still don't understand.
- Well, just that. I need to think.
Things about your past ?
Yes, and my present as well.
Alice, I know how your
illness bothers you.
How it hurts you to see
these sick children.
I know of your compassion for the weaker.
Stop repeating everything like a parrot.
- Alice !
- What ?
No, get off !
Right. I'm going back to Buenos Aires.
You 'll realize what you lost.
You have no idea where you are.
You wouldn't be frightened
by a cat, would you ?
Come, daddy.
Erda ! Erda !
Blanca did it too hard again.
Tell her to stop, tell her to stop.
Yes, yes, don't be a crybaby, my sweetie.
It's no big deal.
Tell Peter to put a bandage on it.
Tomorrow it won't hurt any more.
Oh dear me, these children are so naughty.
Oh those kids!
But don't worry, it's nothing.
Some are so brutish.
Yes, but...
I know that boy.
I don't know where from.
I don't get it.
A cup of tea.
No, I don't want one, thanks.
To clear the mind.
Are you feeling okay?
No.
I have to leave.
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
Why?
What are you doing?
You 're crazy.
These children are not yours.
They are missing children.
They don't belong to you, madam.
They are not missing,
they are found.
And we give thanks to our Lord
that He brought them here.
You 're a crazy woman.
You 're a criminal.
Go back to Limbo.
You're not as alone as you think.
No! I won't go back there.
It's bad.
You should come with me.
Where is your mommy and daddy?
My father lives with me,
and my grandfather died
a hundred twenty years ago.
Go back to Limbo now!
You 're not controlling the situation.
You 're disappointing me.
You don't know how much it hurts
when you speak to me that way.
I understand that maybe you couldn't have
your own children, that you love kids,
and that you feel compassion for them.
Please let them go.
Why don't you let them go?
Go ask them if they want to leave.
Madam, you're drugging them.
Of course they will want to stay.
Why don't you think about their parents.
How long have they been here?
Well... some, about 74 years now.
Stop joking around!
Okay,
Fine.
I'll tell you then.
These children
are the chosen ones.
Chosen by God.
Or 'vampires' as they say.
These children
were bitten by shameless
adult vampires.
They are in the same
physical state since then.
Wandering in a cruel world
that discriminates and rejects them,
marginalizes them.
And well, I'm here to find them,
bring them here
and prepare them for their final destiny
Which planet do you live on?
What planet do I live on?
Emiliano.
Emiliano is the boy who cared
for me when I was dying.
Emiliano?
Siegfried.
Sometimes they change their names.
For years I thought it was a dream.
My father hurt him.
No, this makes no sense at all.
See for yourself.
Rapunzel.
Lift her lip.
They 're fake.
Of course they're fake.
His haven't grown yet!
But these are real.
Look, look, touch.
These are real.
Look. They're not fully grown.
They're still very small.
Some are even older than I am.
So wait, Seigfried is really
30 years old like he said?
Seigfried, beware of that one.
He's a sinner with an angel's face.
So that's why they go out at night?
Well, yes, the elder ones are
permitted to drink human blood.
The younger ones, no, only animal blood.
Except when they are baptized.
Baptized?
What, so they can drink human blood?
And what? You lot don't drink Christ 's
blood for salvation. This is the same!
By the way, in two months,
there will be a baptism here.
And you're the first invited.
Erda, I need batteries for the flashlight.
Batteries for the flashlight...
Can it be possible that still
listen to what I have to say little girl
after so many years you vampires
still can't see at night?
You know how much
batteries cost these days?
No, I don't know how much they cost.
You seem confused.
Trying to help trace missing
children, hundreds of them.
Where did you imagine they all went?
In some children's Bermuda triangle?
Beaten, kidnapped,
raped multiple times
or all drowned in acid tanks?
Oh please.
Those are fantasies of bourgeois people
obsessed with sex and death.
It's something much more logical,
When they are converted to a vampire,
they come to a Limbo.
What, there's more than one Limbo?
There's more than one Limbo?
There's more than one Limbo?
Of course there is!
How many children disappear
per year in our country?
About 400 a year.
Yes, and in the world?
About 50,000 I think.
50,000!
How many acid tanks would that need?!
Please.
There are 12 Limbos in Argentina.
But this is the most beautiful one.
It's the most beautiful one, correct?
Yes, really beautiful.
Two boys are missing.
Count
You go, you go...
- Chief?
- Finish them off.
I remember your red hair.
I love your red hair.
You didn't used to see me.
I lived for months alone
in the woods near your home.
I took care of you
because no one did.
They knew I used to go
but I'd do it anyway.
You shouldn't be here.
My dad will go mad.
You know what,
the river has swollen.
Give me water, please.
Again!
You 're letting her die!
She's dying!
What happened?
We have to finish him off
or they 'll finish me off.
Your dad saw me, wounded me,
and nearly killed me.
And I thought you 'd died.
Alicia, don't leave me again.
Of course.
I disgust you.
I'm nobody to you.
It's the same with all you women.
And I can't even kill myself.
No, that's not it.
You need to give me more time
to get used to this.
Alicia...
Will you let me penetrate you?
No.
Children, how old are you?
Twenty-two.
And you, how old are you?
Thirty-seven
How old are you?
Girls, how old are you?
Eighty.
Kolgate, for a sharper smile,
Kolgate.
Your best ally
are psychological defenses.
In particular, human fear.
Fear of the unknown,
Of changing.
Count
Is it true that your glance you can boil
blood of a mortal?
Not only mortal's
As I was saying, half of our power
lies in the manipulation of fear.
The other half is what
God gifted each one of us.
Each one of us has a place in this world.
It's already written.
That'll be 32 pesos.
I'm lost
Can you take me to your daddy?
I want to be big like you.
One day you will be.
You want to sit a while with us?
There's a quiet place over here.
Would you like an ice cream?
We can help you if you want.
HOW?
You want to hurt me?
We would never hurt a child.
Believe us, we'd never harm a child.
But you're NOT a child!
No.
I see you took revenge quickly.
They were eight years old.
Their fangs had not even grown yet.
Oh, poor kids.
And their protector,
well, their little protector,
couldn't even save them.
United, not so little.
Prove it to me.
I'm here.
Waiting.
Chief, what's stopping you?
You haven 't told them yet?
Darkness will come,
and will cover you all.
You really think they'll
like what you write?
I don't think so.
Men prefer to superstition over Truth.
They queue up to drink the
false blood of Christ
In order to gain life eternal.
When here we'd give it to them for free!
I wanted to ask:
Why are so many of them children?
And why do wealthy societies eat Lamb?
Or Veal, or suckling pig.
It's because they meat and blood
is very sought after.
It's truly delicious.
Youth looks and tastes more nicer
for avid and demanding palates.
Thanks little ones.
The best form of prevention
is to raise fat and ugly kids.
Erda! Erda!
Juanito is sucking himself!
Again?!
Juanito!
Is it true what she tells me?
You've been sucking yourself?
No Erda, I've done nothing.
And what are those stains then?
And what's this?
'Thou shalt not spill thy seed in vain'
Genesis 38:39
Leave now, young sinner.
And pray for your salvation.
The conversion affects testosterone levels.
I have to run a very strict discipline here.
Enchanting.
Try this one.
It's from a nun.
From '84.
I don't like it.
Very bitter.
Shh!
You can stay as long as you want.
They bit you at a beautiful age.
<i>I '</i> m attractive?
Yes, no I don't know.
If you were a little older maybe.
I am a little older.
So, am I attractive?
You know I can't stay.
Look,
the truth is, when we were kids,
you were the one who
most took care of me.
With you, I felt safe. It was
it was beautiful.
But things changed.
You've changed.
I haven 't changed one bit.
Yes, Seigfried,
you've changed.
Oh, that.
Night is not the day without sun,
but its own world.
Humans fear it.
They do everything to avoid it.
Locked up in their houses,
in cinemas, in bars...
It's like being frightened of solitude.
Frightened of facing themselves.
Man, with little light bulbs,
is trying to cheat the night.
But they don't realize
they are surrounded by
galaxies of darkness.
It's as vain
as trying to combat death.
We know the night.
It speaks to us.
It whispers to us the truths of this world.
There is no future for mankind.
Not the way it stands now.
They must change.
Help us, Alicia.
Pardon me. I wanted to ask you a favor...
What's wrong?
No...
Are you okay?
Yes, yes.
The thing is
I get older,
he doesn't.
I' m nobody.
Why do you say that?
Because I'm not a human,
nor am I a chosen one.
I could not convert into one of them.
Remember, I told you
that I was a hemophiliac.
Yes, I am also, but...
Oh, of course.
A vampire that bleeds out is not ideal.
No, of course it's not ideal.
So my dearest, you can relax,
You 'll never be converted.
But beware...
because they can still bite you.
And what they say about
when they pierce you with a stake
in the heart
you really die?
And you wouldn't?
So how do you die?
We 're not telling you.
Don't you get bored with blood?
Always the same every day.
Mer finnst Haggis
It depends what kind of blood.
There's is old blood and new blood.
Like me, I like older blood.
I don't know about her.
- Old blood? From an old person?
- Yeah, that's it.
I like newborn's blood.
Really?
O positive.
Me, A positive.
Diabetic blood.
- It's sweeter?
- Yes.
And vegetarians?
And the Count, why do they
call him 'The Count'?
He's some sort of
aristocrat or something?
One doesn't play with the Count.
But I'm not playing...
You don't know?
Don't know what?
The Count is His Grandson.
Who's grandson?
Of our father and protector,
Count Dracula.
His real grandson?
They say that in this house
he keeps his grandfather's
cape, and other items.
He's at war with the son of a writer.
He kills with only his gaze.
Their blood boils.
Eg elska gullfiskur
One more question.
Sincerely, tell me,
how does it feel being so hated?
Being the curse of the world.
In my Grandfather's biography...
Bram Stoker's original, right?
One doesn't mention his name.
He's a traitor.
A despicable man
who could not accept his
condition within our race.
He denounced our species
for fame and money.
He's our Judas.
From a fear without name
we started being hunted like animals.
But he died.
He died like a common mortal, yes.
But his very son who has
no talent as a writer
found more brutish ways
of hiding his roots.
He could come here?
He can't enter.
Not without an invitation.
Chief,
What do I tell the men?
Nothing, until say so.
They've been here for days now.
They say you're frightened.
They'll be here soon.
Come. save him.
You're worse than your father.
You 're no longer even a half vampire.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get this girl down.
Can 't you see she sleep walks?
Got to her down.
And how do we get her down now?
How? It's already done.
Dear me, I have to do
this every other day.
I don't find it funny what you say.
No, of course, you're right.
It's a cruel world
But not for very much longer now.
What do you mean by that?
Thanks to our little ones,
all existing humans will be
transformed into one of us.
It's absurd. It would take
generations to do that.
It'll be done soon, the process
started a long time ago.
It will mark the birth of a new humanity.
A more compassionate one.
All united, blood brothers.
Man has fed off the weaker for centuries
and never paid the price.
Now the food chain is inverted.
Those who ate
will now become food.
You're not going?
I've got you.
How old did you say you were?
Thirty-three, like you.
We swore we'd love each other forever.
You remember.
We said we'd never separate.
Every year they build this
cabin for the Baptism feast.
It's the biggest event for us.
We party all night then all day.
That's why they're no windows?
Ow!
Why is she always so angry?
They bit her during her acne period.
And she 'll stay like that for all eternity?
I'm afraid so.
What are they doing?
Sometimes the smaller ones feel
a little lonely.
So they send messages to
the children in the village.
And they answer back?
The river only flows in one direction.
We 'll exterminate you
and your filthy race.
You're frightened.
Of What?
I taste your end.
It's YOUR end.
You have no idea how many we are.
It's all arranged.
Hey, Alicia!
Want some?
What?
This, curry.
You get high on curry?
Yeah.
This is the best.
From Pakistan.
Yes I know, it's shocking,
we're like everyone else
and here in Limbo
we have a drug addiction problem.
Because they suffer so much.
Much more than anyone can imagine.
And all of this is from the rejection
and the generalized hatred towards them.
And they
feel bad and they lose their self-esteem.
And the only way out they have is
curry.
Alicia, please, help me!
Gabriel?
Look what they've done to me.
They take my blood out for their
masses, those lunatics.
- Help me please
- What do I do?
Ah!
- Help me
- How?
Untie me first.
Come closer.
Let's go!
- Come on!
- Wait for me outside, I'm coming.
I'll wait for you.
What are you doing?
What are YOU doing?
Why don't you knock?
You were leaving?
If I don't, they'll do the same
to me as with Gabriel.
Don't tell me you released him...
Don't you think he donated
enough blood already?
How mindless.
You don't know what he's done.
These are the worst men...
What are you saying? I know him well.
He's a colleague from work,
a photographer
No! That's a front. It's a front.
That man is an Exterminating Angel.
They spend their lives going
from Limbo to Limbo
killing innocent souls in cold blood.
That can't be true.
No?
Why do you think the day you
arrived we had to bury one of ours?
And before that,
The worst in History,
An entire colony of children, massacred...
Matron.
Ask him who did this.
Bring reinforcements Daddy, quickly.
Let them fly here.
There's little time left.
What did they do to you?
They're perverted. They're horrible.
They made me do terrible things.
This is too much!
Hand above the head.
Yes, excellent!
Very good!
No, I won't do it!
What do you mean you won't do it?
I won't do it.
If you don't, we'll open the tap
and leave you
A cute little jump, like this!
Come on.
No, real sexy, real sexy!
Do we attack now?
No.
I know how they move.
We'll wait till tomorrow,
when the sun comes out.
Fatty.
Look how each one of your children die.
Enjoy it.
As we do.
Run!
<i>ATTACK'.!</i>
You're 'it'!
Alicia, this is for you.
You 're 'it'!
What?
You're going to kill...
You'll kill a vampire brother?
Over there, in the trees!
It's disappeared!
My acne's gone with the sun.
It's gone! Thank you!
Carry the mark of a coward
for all eternity.
Thank you.
Count
So, you can't stay with us?
My lineage is genetically constructed
to protect the race.
They are expecting me in Patagonia.
Some of us had to disappear
for the greater good of the race.
Are you ready Alicia?
So you come this way, with the camera.
I'll come from here, and attack you.
- And you drop the camera.
- Okay, okay.
- And you be dead, all right?
- Yes, yes, got it.
Record, right?
Ah! No!
Scream, it hurts you, come on!
But you're tickling me!
Ah!
Should we finish?
Are you ready?
Yes.
CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT
We have discovered a video on the
attack and killing of Alicia Delatorre,
a well known local journalist.
We warn that these images are very graphic
and viewer discretion is advised.
At the same time an investigation
is underway to shed light
on her disappearance which is
thought to be connected
to a Satanic ritual led by men in black
who have been seen in that area
over the recent months.
We will keep you informed of
any further developments.
