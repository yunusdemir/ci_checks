The story so far:
In Brussels,
Becky made a triumphant entrance
into high society
on the winnings
of her talented husband.
I believe your Rawdon is widely
famed for his skills as a player.
Becky's charms worked
all too well on the wrong man.
Bad and wicked woman!
False friend and false wife!
The world at war,
the women left behind.
The battle so close.
Tonight, Becky decides
that war isn't so bad,
so long as there's money to be made.
Yes, it's Vanity Fair.
A world where
everyone is striving...
for what is not worth having.
# All along the watchtower
# All along the watchtower
# Princes kept the view
♪ There must be
Some kind of way out of here. ♪
If we don't get there soon,
it'll all be over
without this regiment firing a shot.
Somehow I doubt that, George.
Lord, the poor fellow, sir.
Help will come to them.
Eyes forward, lad.
We will fight together bravely,
as we've been trained to do.
No harm shall come to us.
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh, oh, gosh!
Oh!
Oh, dear. Oh, dear me!
Keep calm, don't panic!
Oh, dear heavens!
Mr Joseph!
How is your poor, dear sister today?
He... says that the French
have left 20,000 British dead
upon the battlefield,
and she says the army are retreating
in the utmost confusion!
Rumours?
Yes.
The French are within
ten miles of the city
and have orders to kill every man
within the walls.
Oh! Did you find any horses?
Non. Try again!
Merde!
Yes, my sister, good question!
Even I, a peer of the realm,
cannot be expected to spirit horses
out of thin air
during a battle, madam.
Shame on a husband
who cannot defend the virtue
of his weak and feeble lady.
Weak and what...? Good God, madam,
have you never looked in the mirror?
Testing times, my Lord Bareacres.
Oh, indeed!
Oh, madam, if you should know
of any horses hereabouts that have,
er, yet to be requisitioned...
None to be had for love nor money.
You do know there's a war on?
Here, my darlings.
Here I am.
Do you miss my Rawdon?
Madame!
Shh! Silence!
The boy will tell the lords,
the lords will tell the ladies,
and you... my pretty ones...
will make my fortune today.
Sounds just like my grandmother
shaking out her blankets.
Tiffin?
Your husband mustn't find you ill
when he sends for you
after the victory.
I can't.
Try, Emmy.
Please try!
The soup is very good.
How can I eat?
Remember, you're not the only woman
whose life is in God's hands today.
Begging your pardon, miss.
Lady Bareacres sends
her compliments,
and desires to know the price
of Captain Crawley's horses...
..what are hidden in the stables.
How odd...
that your mistress should think
it could ever be in my custom
to transact business with a servant.
Send me her lady's maid, would she?
Whatever next -
would her ladyship require me
to saddle the horses myself?
Muck out their stables?
I am insulted, sir!
Yes.
Quite.
Can you hear something?
Halt!
Quiet, boy!
Cavalry ride! Full speed ahead!
Protect the colours!
We're too late.
Gad, they're upon us.
The French have broken through
our lines!
Hold the line!
Standard-bearer, to me! To me!
Urgh!
I cannot sell my horses
to such as will not love them.
I shall love any creature
that will get me home to England.
Ah, but you won't get home, my lady.
The French are at the gates,
and they'll get you first.
You, and the two great rubies
you wore
to the Duchess of Richmond's ball.
But fear not.
I imagine the gems
will interest the savages much more
than the lady who wears them.
Sell to me, and not only
shall you have my rubies,
but I shall so far extend my dignity
as to invite you to dine
with your betters at Bareacres Hall.
If I had any betters in this world,
Bareacres Hall is the last place
I should expect to find them.
Name your price, woman!
Beyond rubies.
Are you hurt?
There we go, darling.
You all right?
The strumpet refuses to sell!
"March to Waterloo," he says.
I can't see any such place
on this map.
Crawley!
Where in buggeration is Waterloo?
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.
He restoreth my soul.
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness.
The guns!
What?
The guns, listen!
They are silent!
So they are.
For tonight, at least.
The men on that hill over there.
I see no hill.
Not in this murk.
Hundreds of them.
Thousands.
All God's creatures,
just like you and me, George.
And yet, tonight, with all my soul,
I wish them as dead
as the earth they sit upon.
What kind of world would it be
if the wishes of dear old Dobbin
of ours fell always on deaf ears?
Ours shall be the glory, old friend.
Depend upon it.
Mr Joseph!
Sit.
No appetite?
What can ail you so?
A most tragical want of horses.
What do you need horses for?
You can't imagine Amelia would leave
without her husband.
And clearly, you would not leave
without your sister, so...
..here we shall remain...
to await a fate worse than death.
They say the enemy
shall spare the women.
Oh, how unusual!
I do fear for you, Mr Joseph.
Should the French find you looking
quite so much the military man.
Your military greatcoat, monsieur,
with the gold frogging.
Take it!
Your velvet cap
with the ostrich feath... Take it!
Take what you like,
but find me some damned horses!
I have heard a rumour, sir.
Beneath a confident rider,
he is as quiet as a lamb
and as fast as a hare.
Can he stand my weight?
Oh, and strong as an ox!
So you and Amelia on Bullfinch,
and your servant and Mrs O'Dowd
on Foxcub.
Buy both animals?
The horses are inseparable, sir.
As are the ladies.
But when my Rawdon comes home.
IF he comes home. Oh, Mr Sedley!
Mrs Crawley...
I beg you,
how much for Bullfinch and Foxcub?
It'll break his heart.
Becky, for the love of God,
how much?
God forgive you, Mr Sedley, for you
are nothing better than a coward!
Don't listen to HER, Emmy.
Fine sight I would be
riding pillion
behind that great dandy!
I have two horses. I have near
bankrupted myself to get them.
I don't budge till I get
the word from Mick!
And I'm not asking you,
you mad Paddy witch!
Amelia, dear sister,
for the last time,
will you come with me?
Joseph, dearest brother...
..I cannot leave without my husband.
Then dear God preserve you.
How bad is it?
Oh, now, look.
Our first poor fellows are back.
Come on.
George, George... Please, God!
Don't wish for anything,
and remember, we are in God's hands.
God!
George!
Mrs Osborne.
Ambushed.
George?
He lives.
Oh, thanks be to God!
The Major?
All spared.
Captain Dobbin said
I was to be taken in here.
You've to pay the driver
two Napoleons.
My mother will pay you back.
Right. Yes!
Who can help him, come on.
Help him down.
Be careful!
Epaulettes, plumes,
straight from the battlefield.
The blood still warm
on some of this latest German stuff,
madame.
No, I only want French ones.
Onwards, Isidor.
Ever onwards!
You can get a new hat.
It was Captain Osborne who cut down
the Frenchman who slashed me.
Ah!
Slowly, slowly, slowly.
Voila. Voila.
He was a hero.
And so is Dobbin.
Best officer in the army,
is Captain Dobbin, ma'am.
So kind. And modest,
and cool under fire.
And so... we saw them off.
And so the war is over?
Lord, no, miss.
No.
They're only waiting
for the ground to dry.
Come on, be brave. Come on.
That's it.
Well prepared.
Brave lads, all.
The French artillery
are coming about.
Indeed they are. Tell the 44th
and the 47th to expect cavalry.
Right.
Sergeant Major, fix bayonets.
Battalion will fix bayonets.
Battalion fix bayonets!
Prepare to receive cavalry!
Steady! Their artillery
is coming into range.
Hold the line, men!
Steady, boys!
Into your hands, O Lord.
Steady your nerves!
Keep the line tight!
Steady!
Hold your positions!
Keep the line tight.
Hold force!
Sir...
May they be cut down
like a field of corn!
Sergeant Major, block up.
Steady!
Please, someone, help me!
Hold the line!
Captain Osborne!
Prepare to give fire.
Prepare your fire!
Wait!
Hold your fire!
Captain Osborne!
Open fire!
I said hold your fire, damn you!
Captain Osborne, hold your fire!
Captain Osborne, wait!
Open fire!
B company, fire!
B company, front right, fire!
A company, centre, fire!
B company, centre, fire!
The French are retreating.
Not for long.
It's getting hard to see, sir.
Vive la France!
Vive la France!
Vive la France!
Here they come.
Steady, lads. Steady!
Now!
First rank... FIRE!
Second rank, fire!
Halt! Port arms!
Charge bayonets.
By the centre, ordinary march!
Well done, lads,
take them all the way to Paris!
Now is our time!
NO!!
It is a letter from Mrs Crawley.
I see Rawdon has sold out
of the Guards as a colonel.
Well, the valiant creature
does deserve a quieter life.
Oh...
..a pair of French epaulettes.
With the Cross of the Legion
of Honour.
And the hilt of a sword.
And does Mrs Rebecca claim,
as usual,
that the heroic Colonel Rawdon
cut said objects from a Frenchman,
begging for his life?
Well, it...
It could be true. Matilda.
It was entertaining at first,
but I'm bored
with the Battle of Waterloo.
We did win, after all.
Is Mrs Osborne quite well?
Is Mrs Osborne warm enough?
Whoa...
Mr Osborne!
Drive on, damn you!
Hold, driver!
I will see you, sir.
You presume to command me,
Captain Dobbin?
Or must I now salute...
Major Dobbin?
Since better men than you have died,
and you step into their shoes?
But the men are dead.
Yes, sir.
Nothing could have prepared us
for the slaughter.
There were times when I thought...
..I thought this might be
the only battle
in the sorry history of the world...
..when not a single man
on either side was left alive.
Job was done.
We move on.
His widow is without means, sir.
And soon the poor lady
will be a mother.
Will you punish the child
for the sins of the parent,
or will you forgive the child,
your grandchild, sir?
For the sake of George,
who fought more bravely
than even you could have hoped.
That boy died without
ever confessing he did me wrong.
Without... ever apologising
to a father...
he wronged so wickedly.
Believe me, he deeply regretted
the loss of your affection.
She may have seven children
and starve, for all I care.
She is dead to me.
Oh, don't cry, little man.
How am I supposed to know
what's the matter with him?
Oh, it's a long journey,
perhaps he's tired.
Or hungry.
Are you hungry, little man?
Well, he'll have to learn to wait,
like the rest of us.
Oh, is that nice?
Did you like that? Did you?
Yes, you did.
I don't know why you bother when
there'll be servants at the hotel.
He likes it better from me,
don't you, young man?
Who's a nice soldier?
Who's my little soldier?
Who's my little soldier?
Right, it's been long enough.
We must go back to London.
Why?
Because...
he is the image of you.
And the money's all gone.
Shh!
I brought him something.
Oh, so sweet, William.
What would we do without you?
Just pop them over there quietly.
It's wonderful to see
the change in you, Amelia.
He is so beautiful.
So like my George, isn't he?
Perfect.
I am come to say goodbye.
Why, where are you going?
The... the regiment
is under orders for India.
I shall be gone a very long time.
I'll write to you.
All about Georgie.
All his adventures,
and all his scrapes.
Dear William,
how good you've been to us both.
Come closer.
Look at him.
Isn't he an angel?
He is shaking your hand goodbye.
God bless you both.
Present arms.
Oh! Mrs Crawley.
I thought you were the doctor. Ohh!
I wish the doctor would come.
I did not know what to do.
She will not let me near her.
Oh, dear Miss Crawley.
Remember how well I nursed you once?
Please, heaven, this time.
I shall nurse you again,
if you'll permit me.
I'm so sorry.
Everything's gone wrong
since we parted.
I regret it so much.
I love Rawdon and he loves me.
But I never wanted to be a mother.
I never had one of my own,
I don't know how to be one now.
And to be excluded
from the light of your love
has caused us so much hurt.
Oh, Miss Crawley, please forgive us!
We could move in.
What, here?
Why not?
Because it's not ours.
Because, the whole family
will stand up and drive us out.
Why can't you see that?
Well, where do you suggest
we all live?
For our invalid.
Oh, Mr Raggles,
such terrible news!
It's not a palace, Mrs Crawley.
Not even a mansion such as
you and the Colonel are used to.
It's quite charming, Mr Raggles.
Oh, some might say it's a big step
for such as me and Mrs Raggles
to set ourselves up as landlords.
Why shouldn't honest working people
see the fruits of their labours?
We can't afford Mayfair.
As soon your aunt's will is read.
The poor old girl
is not yet cold in her grave.
And who's to say
if she will favour us at last?
I, Matilda Crawley, do by this,
my last will and testament,
further give and bequeath
to my companion of many years,
Miss Arabella Briggs,
my second-best tea service
and the sum of £600.
Oh! Oh, no, not deserved.
No, no!
To my younger nephew,
Rawdon Crawley,
My prize collection of souvenirs
from the Battle of Waterloo,
and a single payment of...
..yes...
one hundred pounds...
in full valuation of my esteem
for the choices he's made
in his life.
Oh, dear!
Oh! Oh, my poor dear Rawdon!
You jumped the wrong way there,
Becky, my girl.
The residual part of my estate,
the house and some £70,000,
I leave to my nephew, Bute,
and his heirs in perpetuity.
They poisoned her against us,
the villains!
The smug, poisonous,
black-hearted devils!
All the rage in the world
won't get us your aunt's money now.
Rawdon, listen to me.
Listen!
We must stay friends
with your brother.
There's no point making enemies
where the money is,
and if things go really badly, well,
I'll be his governess
and you can be his butler.
No? All right, stable boy.
Dearest husband, show me a smile.
You know I'm right.
And why shouldn't I live in Mayfair?
Because I cannot afford the rent.
Listen to me.
This shall be our gaming room.
Here, you will play
all-comers in all games.
Faro, piquet, ecarte.
It'll be like a club.
In a private house.
Warm, comfortable, respectable.
You will win, except when
I judge it helpful for you to lose,
and I will grow in charm
with each profitable day.
What could possibly go wrong?
Mrs Rawdon Crawley...
This might be...
your best plan yet.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Look, Georgie, happy Christmas.
I wish you could see how delighted
he is with the gifts you send.
Oh, William.
I wish you could see him growing up.
Rules over us.
Rules over us all.
As did his father.
Every night, we pray together,
to ask our dear Lord
to bless my husband, as if...
..as if he had not left us.
And we always add
a little prayer for you.
For our only friend,
on the other side of the world,
in India.
Major Dobbin,
won't you join us for a cup of tea?
I... I'm afraid... Um...
Excuse me.
Dear Jane,
I hope this letter finds you well,
and the worst of your grief is past.
I think of your dear brother
every day and mourn his loss.
I think also of his child,
and the poor widow he left behind.
I wish with all my heart they had
a friend closer than 5,000 miles.
I still long to believe,
for George's sake,
your father's heart
may one day melt.
In God's name, Miss Osborne,
what is the matter with you tonight?
I've seen him, sir.
I've seen little George,
and, sir,
he's as beautiful as an angel,
and he's the living image of...
Who are you?
What do you want?
Georgie! Where are your manners?
I am alone here.
Just a little ride together.
Just half an hour.
My parents are from home, Jane.
It's the child's grandfather.
Amelia! Please...
Wait there.
Ready?
Go to Auntie Jane.
So, young George.
Yes, sir?
Do you know who I am?
No, sir.
I'm your grandfather.
No, you're not!
Marry again?
He's very generous, if you listen,
he says even if you marry again,
the allowance he makes you
will continue.
Take money to part from my child?
It doesn't say that.
"It must be understood
that the child will live
"entirely with his grandfather
at the Osborne residence,
"and will be occasionally permitted
to see Mrs George Osborne."
It is an insult!
Amelia, it doesn't do to be selfish.
You call a mother selfish
who will not give up her child?
Mr Osborne says here
in black and white
that he will make Georgie his heir,
that he will inherit everything
his father lost...
When he made the dreadful mistake
of marrying me(!)
Every child must leave
his mother's petticoats someday.
I lost my husband.
I will not lose my son!
The answer is still no!
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Oh, no, you don't,
there'll be hell to pay
if you disturb your mamma's singing!
Ah, please take Rawdy up to bed.
I don't want to!
Why can't I stay down here
with you and Mamma?
Hush, hush.
You mustn't bother Mamma...
not when she has guests.
There's a brave boy.
I wish Mamma would sing for me!
Stay with him till he sleeps.
Come on. Let's go back to bed.
I will sing you something.
My Lord Steyne.
And how is Mrs Crawley's husband?
Still busy keeping
the wolf from the door?
Milord.
Comme je suis enchante.
