A WONDERFUL LOVE STORY
Hi.\N\N\N
Hi.
What's up?
Okay. We're going to film my cousin
Koldo, who I'm sure is a little nervous.
Auntie!
Koldo? Koldo?
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Cousin!
- What's up, Cousin?
- How are you?
- Great. What about you?
- Well... Can't you tell?
You're great! You look great!
And no rice.
No, don't throw rice.
The girl wants rose petals.
- How refined.
- Come on, give us a hand!
Koldo! Koldito!
What are you doing lurking around here?
Hey, do you remember my cousin Adrián?
Of course I do. But the last time
I saw you, you were a dwarf.
Hey, if you film any
good- Looking girls, tell me, okay?
Speaking of the devil,
is Natalie coming?
But aren't you even going to
give it a rest on my wedding day?
- But is she coming or not?
- She's already inside.
Perfect!
Hey, who... Who's Natalie?
Natalie, Natalie,
Arise, children of the Fatherland.
Let's see. Look over there. Okay...
What equipment!
Hey, what's this for?
That's for stabilizing the image and
creating cinema-quality movements.
Otherwise, with all this stuff on your
shoulder, the picture is unwatchable.
Can you shoot films with this, too?
Here, some of them.
In America, all of them.
All of them?
Look, look, look, look. Cinéma verité.
And what about your camera, kid?
This one's got high- Definition.
HD with megapixels.
With megapixels?
Hey, can you do me a favour?
Could you get some shots inside,
since you're family?
Yeah, I'm going to film everything, I swear.
Film what the naked eye wouldn't see.
Dziga Vertov, Cinéma Verité.
Yeah, of course.
I swear to God I'll film everything.
- What's your name, sunshine?
- Adrián. And you?
- Atún.
- Okay. Pleased to meet you.
Tita, put your cardigan on, we're going.
See you later, Estela.
- Have you got your keys?
- Yes, dear, don't worry.
And where's Clara?
Well, she's not upstairs. I don't know.
- What do you mean, she's not upstairs?
- No.
- Go and look for your sister in the kitchen.
- No, this way.
And put that camera away!
Clara, we're leaving!
Are you all right?
Tita,
Switch off the camera.
I've got something to tell you.
I think...
Bye!
Here's Koldo with uncle Pepe Víctor.
Let's see what he has to say.
He's always making trouble.
If you change your mind, I'll divorce
your aunt. And steal her from you.
What are you saying!
Well, that's great, Uncle. Viva Valencia!
- Víctor, Pepe Víctor!
- I'm coming, Amparín, I'm coming!
Hey, Uncle, what happened to your hand?
Don't say anything to your aunt.
A dog in the clinic...
- It looked like it was dead...
- What happened?
and he woke up and bam!
He just made a right mess of it.
- You mean he bit you?
- Yeah, but don't worry, I'm...
- Are you all right?
- Can't you tell?
- Come on! Pepe Víctor, let's go!
- I've got a little something for you.
- I'll come and find you later, okay?
- Yeah, yeah...
Give it to me.
I like filming.
Yeah.
Well, she's a bit nervous, of course.
But she's really beautiful.
You should see her.
All right.
Come on, she's on her way.
Everybody inside!
Come on, Koldo. Chin up! Be brave!
Come on, get inside!
- Come on, inside!
- Come on, get moving!
- Where's my father?
- Your father's inside.
- With Mónica, Óscar and the kids.
- Okay, okay, come on...
Come on, come on, let's go!
Everybody inside!
Go get 'em!
At the back! Come on, let's get inside.
- Do you want one, Adri?
- No. No, thanks.
Hey! The boys are here!
And the fool who's getting married?
Where's he got to, mate?
He's inside. Where do you think?
Hey, kid!
Hey Rafita...
So good-looking...
Hey, Charlie! Inside! Give us a hug!
There... Great!
And so, as you wish to enter
into matrimony, join hands...
Clara, take this ring...
as a sign of my love and
my fidelity to you.
Koldo, take this ring as a sign of
my love and my fidelity to you.
You've been tangled up with me
for years in my hands, my hair
in my head
And I can't do it any more
I can't do it any more
I should be tired of
your hands, your hair
your strange ways
but I want more
I want more
I can't live without you
There's no way
I can't be without you
No way
You're gorgeous!
Long live the happy couple!
Viva!
Well done, son!
Photo!
And now the family!
Uncle, Uncle, Uncle...
Granddad, how are you? How are you?
- Okay, so you're going...
- Are you happy?
Oh, yes!
Your hearing aid!
Are you hearing me? Granddad!
Can you hear?
Can I have your attention, please?
The buses for the reception
are behind the church.
So, there's room for everyone,
but little by little.
Let's not all get there at once, okay?
Okay, thanks.
Look at them!
- You're going to look so cute!
- Have you seen your brother?
Hey, kid, have you seen your brother?
The kid's just got married
and he's already sneaking off?
Unbelievable!
There's such a lot of people here!
Well, we're at the reception
in this marvelous place.
This must have cost them a fortune!
Hi, beautiful. How are you?
- No alcohol?
- No, it's alcohol- Free.
- No alcohol?
- No alcohol.
- What is it?
- Piña colada.
- Piña colada? I'll have one!
- He knows it!
- I'll have one!
- All right!
Mother and daughter!
Well, the mother's a little
bit of a MILF, isn't she?
- Granddad?
- Yes?
- They said it was going to rain, eh?
- Yes. When I went to school...
That hasn't got much to do
with anything, but yeah...
I missed...
I was saying how pretty your mother is...
But you...
- Yeah, come on.
- It's getting better.
Bye.
Cinéma verité, mate!
There, there.
That guy's really good!
It has to be edited...
with a touch of fresco,
a touch of Renoir,
a pinch of cinéma verité.
Yeah, yeah, right.
- Very down to earth, very online.
- Online?
Uncle, Are you all right?
- Yes.
- Yeah?
Look at the lovebirds.
- I'm really happy, very happy.
- Me too.
No. What you are is really pretty.
- I want to tell you something.
- Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.
But you're so pretty.
I mean, you're usually pretty, but today...
Right.
Sorry.
This morning, at my parent's house...
Gorgeous!
Well, thanks to everyone
for being here, and...
I don't know... Koldo and me...
Koldo and me love you lots and
it's great to see that you love us
so much and that you're happy
that we've found the loves of our lives.
Bravo!
That's lovely. That's lovely. That's lovely.
I want a bit!
Get us!
There... There...
Long live the happy couple.
We love you lots.
And for love!
Pour L'amour.
She's stood you up!
She came, she came...
She got confused and she's gone!
- She got away from you!
- Viva la France!
Natalie, Natalie,
Arise, children of the Fatherland.
Hey, Koldito!
Okay, cinéma verité.
Let's continue our programme
with some interviews.
Here we have SpongeBob.
Can I interview you?
Yes, but could we go outside?
I want to smoke a cigarette.
Okay, let's go outside.
There's a room next to the dining
room where we put on games
and shows so that the kids are
entertained during the banquet.
And how long have you been doing this?
Well, weddings, for about ten years
and children's shows, eight.
And what exactly are you dressed up as?
As John Sponge.
That would be SpongeBob?
No. Well, you see, there
was a copyright problem
and now the costume is
called John Sponge.
We are talking about a character
that's got nothing to do with
the one you're talking about.
I don't want any trouble later on.
Don't worry, I swear to God.
Well, that's it. It's really great.
Because the kids love it.
Fuck... There goes a drunk!
That's my uncle!
- Oh, sorry kid, I didn't know.
- Uncle, are you all right?
Sorry, I didn't know he was your uncle.
What are those people doing there?
How strange! Once I heard it was
better to fumigate at night.
Have the cops arrived?
Oh, uncle, if they breathalyze you...
I've just filmed my uncle Pepe Víctor
throwing up, man. It's great!
Enough of Pepe,
enough crap and fumigators.
Come inside and start
filming the good stuff.
You can't rush...
You can't rush things.
You can't rush things! Come on, Rafa!
Come on, Rafa!
I've just filmed Rafa getting
it on with the French woman!
You were made for this, kid!
Yeah!
Uncle!
What are you doing?
Uncle!
Get down!
Uncle!
That's Pepe!
Stop the music!
And call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!
Please move!
Call an ambulance, come on!
An ambulance!
Have you seen Clara?
No.
Look, there's Tita!
Hey, come on!
Follow me!
This way! Koldo!
Get inside! And lock the door!
Lock the door! It's there!
Clara! Have you seen Clara?
Has anyone seen Clara?
No, I haven't seen her!
Jesus!
- What happened out there?
- I don't know...
- Are you filming?
- Yes, everything.
What are you doing?
People have a right to
know what's going on!
I have to film everything!
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Stop! Stop!
- Give me the camera!
- Stop!
You are going to
break it!
You know you're paying
for the camera, right?
Try and call Clara, okay?
The stairs! Let's see if there's an exit.
Come with me!
Come on, come on!
Get back, back!
Lock the door!
- Well?
- I tried. No signal.
I have to find Clara!
I have to find her!
That's not possible right now!
It's no time to act the crazy husband.
You see how fucked-up all this is.
Shit!
My name's Atún. From Filmax films.
What about him?
My name's Moncho.
What part of Clara's family
are you from, Moncho?
He's not from my family.
SGAE Inspector.
What's that?
I make a note of the songs
played at the wedding.
For the payment of royalties.
Hey, come here.
This grille must lead somewhere.
Go!
Go, go!
Shit!
Royalties, you son of a bitch!
Hey, lads, I think there's
something over here!
Go on, go on...
Let me help you!
I'm not going to fit in there.
We can't leave here without Atún.
Don't be so stupid. Go on, get in!
We have to go! We have to go!
Here. I've put it on night-vision
so you can see inside there.
Don't even think about
erasing anything, eh?
Atún, I swear to God
we'll come back for you.
It's dark!
I can't see a thing!
Cousin?
Tita, here, take the camera!
Come on!
We don't know what's going on,
but everything will be all right.
We're going to find your sister and
we're going to get out of here, okay?
I promise.
Come on! Come with me!
- Koldo!
- What's wrong?
When I was outside, I saw a police car.
We have to find it!
Come on, we are going to find it.
Hey! Wait! There's a light!
Maybe this leads outside.
Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Help me, please! Please!
What are you doing there?
Come on, come on, Royalties!
Officer!
Royalties!
Royalties! Royalties!
Help me, for fuck's sake!
Come on, Royalties!
Son of a bitch!
Hello? Please help us!
Can anyone hear me?
How the hell does this thing work?
Please, can anyone hear me?
Please... Help!
Come on! Come on! They're coming!
Come on! Come on!
I'm sorry.
Get a move on!
What are you waiting for? Inside!
Run, Grandma, run! Close it!
Shut up, wise guy.
They can't get in here.
Heretics! Bastards!
Clara! Has anyone seen Clara?
Does anyone have a
mobile phone that works?
None of them are working.
We've got to get these
people out of here!
We're safe in here, Grandma.
Why don't they come in?
They can't set foot in the church,
and holy water hurts them.
We don't know any more.
And I'm not your grandma, dear.
Is there a landline phone here?
There is one, but it doesn't work.
They seem to be going away.
Take the kids and get to the coaches,
all of you.
I'm going to find Clara.
- Wait, Koldo. We don't know if...
- No, don't say that. Shut up, okay?
- Sir, remember that...
- Shut up! I don't want to hear it.
Clara is alive, I'm sure.
I know, because I can sense her.
What the hell is that?
Koldo, it's me.
And I know that, wherever you are,
you can hear me.
I want to tell you that I'm all right.
Father Losara and me,
we're hidden and we're okay.
And I know you're okay, too.
I know you're alive because
I can sense you, Koldo!
Husband!
I love you!
And, well...
I've been trying to talk
to you all day, but...
But we really haven't had
much time to ourselves.
And, it doesn't matter.
So I'm going to tell you like this.
I'm pregnant, Koldo.
We're going to be parents, Koldo.
That's too much.
And it wasn't a shotgun wedding.
For anyone who's listening,
especially from my family.
Just so you know, we didn't
get married because of that.
I found out this morning, at home.
What's happening?
What's happening? Why did it stop?
Why did it stop? Where is she?
The only place with a
megaphone is Central Control.
They must be there.
But right now it's
impossible to get to them.
No, there must be a way.
There must be a way!
Please, help me, God.
St. George.
St. George.
Where is Central Control?
Father, can you see him?
- It's too soon.
- What is?
Not yet. It can't be happening!
- What?
- Genesis.
And the angels which kept
not their first estate,
but left their own habitation...
The Lord kept them in darkness.
Eternal visions...
Where they will be punished forever...
and from which they will not return...
unto the judgment of the great day.
Koldo, where are you?
It's here.
It's here!
It's here, Father.
Come on, Father.
This is the end.
Come on, Father!
Father! Father!
It's...
I'm sorry, we have to get out of here.
Let's go.
What's that?
...and now I'm going down
to the engine room...
What the hell are you doing here?
You don't know what's going on?
No.
Well, you'll never believe it...
That way.
First floor, corridor on the left.
Central Control is down there.
- But do you know where he is?
- No, but we're going to find him.
- A solution.
- What?
They obey orders. I've seen it.
They move as one. They do what
a superior, malign being tells them.
- Where did you get all that from, Father?
- I didn't get anything.
Look how they behave, and you'll see.
They tell us in the Bible...
they control them and lead them...
They tell us in the Bible...
they control them and lead them...
And then you wonder why everyone
thinks French girls are sluts.
They tell us in the Bible...
they control them and lead them...
Come on, let's go. Let's go. Come on.
Jesus.
It's her. Father Albelda is right.
Quickly! Go!
Get going. Don't stop.
Hurry up, go on! Come on, Clara!
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil:
for thou art with me,
thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life:
and I will dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.
Three times I pleaded with the Lord to
take it away from me. And he said unto me,
My grace is sufficient: for my
strength is made perfect in weakness.
Most gladly therefore will I
rather glory in my infirmities,
that the power of Christ
may rest upon me.
Therefore I take pleasure in
infirmities, in reproaches,
in necessities, in persecutions,
in distresses for Christ's sake:
for when I am weak, then am I strong.
Jesus, I can't see a thing.
Where are we?
I don't know.
This way.
There we are.
Jesus!
Hello?
Who's that?
It's me, the children's entertainer.
John Sponge.
Jesus.
You mean Bob?
Well, there was this thing
with the copyright, and...
Bob, put that down, please.
I took it from the guard.
I don't even know if it's loaded.
Don't hold that lighter too close.
This stuff catches fire easily.
Help me lift this barrier up.
It's really heavy.
And this sponge
costume doesn't help.
Why don't you take it off?
Well, because I'm not wearing
anything underneath.
Is there a light here?
Yes, there's a control panel
on the wall there.
Clara, what is all this?
I don't know. I don't know.
We'll get out of here. Don't worry.
...two and three!
I almost decided not to come.
What?
I was thinking about not coming.
The truth is, I was
surprised you invited me.
We haven't seen each other for ages.
Well,
I invited you to be nice.
Because I didn't think you'd come.
I looked on the Internet and I found
this really cheap Vueling ticket.
Fuck!
I'm sorry.
Give me the bloody shotgun!
I'm really sorry I invited
you to my wedding.
Clara, please!
This way! Come on! This way!
Come on, Clara!
What's wrong?
I think I saw something.
Let's go and see.
Come on.
Clara, you stay here.
We're going to see if it's safe, okay?
Clara, leave her. We have to go.
Clara, leave her, we have to go.
This is my mother.
Clara, it's not your mother, okay?
Let her go, we have to leave.
Come on, Clara, they're coming. Come on!
Come on! Run!
This is it!
Come on, Clara! Get in, quick!
Run!
Stop!
The exit is over there!
Jesus, Clara, why are you stopping.
What's wrong?
I'm not going without Koldo.
Don't be so bloody stupid!
We have to go!
Don't tell me what I have to do!
Listen, Clara...
If Koldo was alive...
He would have given us
some sign to let us know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Clara...
It's him.
It's Koldo.
It's a sign.
He's in the lounge.
No, we don't know if it's him.
You said that if he was alive,
he'd give us a sign, didn't you?
Well, there it is.
I'm not leaving here without Koldo.
Move.
Hold my dress.
- What are you going to do?
- Hold my dress!
Now, you make your own decision.
But I know where I'm going.
They've got in.
No, no, no...
Jesus, they're already here.
Clara, come on. Run! We have to go!
No fucking way.
Clara, come on!
This is my day!
This is my day!
This is my day!
Jesus!
Fucking hell!
Oh, God!
No!
Jesus, this is really weird.
This is really weird.
I'm sorry, Rafa.
I'm here! I'm here, my love!
I'm up here!
Koldo! Koldo, my love!
I'm here, my love! I'm here!
I knew it!
Come up, come up. There's a ladder here!
My love...
I'm coming, my love...
I'm coming, my love!
Are you okay?
I love you.
We're never going to be
apart again, are we?
Never.
And we're going to be parents.
We have to open this.
The screwdriver.
There's a screwdriver
in a multi-use knife.
It must be down there somewhere.
You have to find it, love.
It's our only chance. Look for it!
It must be there somewhere. Look again!
It has to be there.
I've got it!
Come on, bring it up!
Here it is!
They're coming, Koldo!
They're coming!
Open it, Koldo! Open it!
Hurry, Koldo!
Let her go!
- My love...
- Hurry, Koldo!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, and you?
Yes.
What's all this?
- And now what do we do?
- The tunnel!
We got out through there earlier.
You would have been a wonderful mother.
I love you.
In the beginning God created
the heaven and the earth.
And the earth was
without form, and void,
and darkness was upon
the face of the deep.
And God divided the light
from the darkness.
And God called the light Day,
and the darkness he called Night.
They're stopping.
They're stopping. Why are they stopping?
I don't know.
But let's go.
Let the waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto one place,
and let the dry land appear:
and it was so.
And God called the dry land Earth,
and the gathering together of
the waters he called Seas...
Is this our family?
Not any more.
...upon the face of the waters.
And God said, Let there be light:
and there was light.
And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven
to give light upon the earth...
No!
No!
God!
Fuck my granddad and his
stupid bloody hearing aid!
The sword.
Pick up the sword.
Pick it up, Koldo...
Come on!
Do it!
Well done, my love.
You're going to be a wonderful father.
What's this?
There are people!
Stay inside and do not come out!
Stay inside! I repeat, do not come out!
Stay inside!
I repeat...
Put her on the ground! She is infected!
I repeat, put her on the ground!
Get away!
She is infected!
I repeat, move away!
Put her on the ground!
