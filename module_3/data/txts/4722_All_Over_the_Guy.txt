One- two-
One, two, three, four...
( theme music playing )
- You've got to face it -
- Love makes no sense -
- Don't try to fight it -
- All your defenses
are useless to you now -
- When you leave this room -
- All you will
think about is me -
- I'll be every song on your radio,
everything on your TV -
- Just wait and see -
- Even though you
never looked at me -
- I know the real you -
- Is behind those eyes -
- Every true story -
- Is full of lies -
- We tell -
( phone ringing )
Recording: Hi, this is Eli,
leave a message.
( beep )
Hey, it's Tom...
once again. Call me.
- I'll take you by the hand -
- And soon
I'll cool your fire -
- Out of your body -
- There is no way -
- You can stand me -
- I know the real you... -
( car alarm blaring )
- Is full of lies -
- That keep still -
- The real you -
- The real you -
- The real you -
- The real you -
- The real... -
- You. -
Hi. I'm Eli Wyckoff.
I'm here for my test results.
You're about an hour early.
Why don't you get yourself
some coffee?
I'm going to wait,
if that's okay.
Okay.
Is this your first time?
My first?
No, no.
I have this habit of getting
tested after every boy-
guy that I ever...
There's only been three
in the past few...
This is the third, so it's not
really a habit.
- Yet.
- Uh-huh.
Oh, no. It's not even a chance
that I have- you know?
I know the dangers.
I do the police blotter
for the Hollywood News,
so, me and danger
are like this.
So why are you here?
( phone ringing )
Feedback Clinic,
this is Esther.
Uh-huh.
Did you suck his dick?
Then you better come in.
Okay.
Hi, I'm Tom,
and I'm an alcoholic.
Group: Hi, Tom.
I'm 1 0 days away
from my thirty-day chip.
Anyway...
both my parents
are drunks.
I still don't feel like
I belong here.
I go to flea markets.
I vote.
Even for, like, school board
and Prop whatever.
I teach special ed,
for Christ's sake.
I'm not like
a Hollywood has-been
crouched in an airport bathroom
sucking on a can of Final Net.
So, why am I here?
The truth?
The truth is I met a guy.
And if I had
to pick... a trigger,
I'd say it was
all over this guy.
But, whatever,
who cares how it happened?
Bottom line is I'm here.
I quit drinking
and guys because
I can't be trusted
with either.
Thanks.
Nice going.
I'll get it right
one of these times.
Sounded right to me.
It was like you were telling
my story.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I shared first,
I get the book's rights.
That's fair.
Tell me about the guy.
I don't want
to keep you from-
What?
From what?
The important things in life
like stapling or filing?
Oh, please!
I couldn't be more bored.
This thing with that guy,
you seem okay with it.
Only to the sight-
and-hearing impaired.
Pull up your chair, honey.
- This one?
- Yeah.
So, you and your boyfriend,
you broke up.
Not a boyfriend,
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know, but things
just got too... "too."
I choked, I'm an alcoholic.
You do the math.
We met on a blind date
which sucked.
We became friends,
and now we don't speak
to each other.
So it's a happy ending.
How did we meet?
It started with a phone call
from my best friend, Jackie.
( answer machine beeping )
John? Pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up...
Damn it!
Where are you?
I'm at a pay phone
because I can't get my shitty
cell phone to work
unless I stand on my head
with my fingers up my ass.
( honking )
Fuck you!
Anyway...
what are you doing
Friday night?
Cause I met this guy, Bret,
at a furniture store
on Montana,
and he showed me this great
loveseat to die for.
I think I can get it wholesale.
There's just one catch...
( music playing )
- Everything I want
You got it -
- Everything I need
You own it -
- Everything I need
You got it -
- Everything in me
You own it -
- Everything I want
You got it -
- Everything I need
You own it -
- Everything I need
You got it -
- Everything in me
You own it. -
Any luck?
Oh! With...?
I thought you were
looking for change
under the cushions.
Oh, God!
You saw me?
Yeah, the whole routine.
Great. Now
I'm thoroughly mortified.
You're fine,
don't worry about it.
I know. Now it's your turn
to do something humiliating.
I work in a furniture store.
Those bases are covered.
What's humiliating about
an employee discount?
Does that apply to
this wheely-carty thing?
'Cause this is yummy.
A, I get 1 0% off of this crap.
And, B, I don't know
if the whole
Clockwork Orange cum Ikea
thing is really your scene.
Quite a salesman.
I don't know
what half this shit is.
Okay, great!
You know, my heart does
beat fast for this loveseat.
You're kidding?
Why?
Do you hate it?
No. It's the only thing
in the store that's mine.
Yours?
One of my designs.
Oh, you're a designer?
Yeah. This is one of
my first projects.
I love it.
Thank you.
What is the color?
Sort of a yellow-beige-yellow?
Buttercup.
Buttercup?
Buttercup.
I'm not gay, just because
I said buttercup.
I have this argument
with Eli all the time.
Just because I say "buttercup,"
doesn't mean I'm gay,
or used to be gay,
or want to be gay.
I'm not gay,
just very particular about
the nomenclature I use
regarding my palette.
Who's Eli?
The boyfriend?
Right.
No, he's my best friend...
who happens to be gay.
- You know what I think?
- What?
I think you're one of those guys
who flirts with a girl,
maybe even takes her to dinner,
but when push comes to shove,
the only frenching you'll be
doing with her are her braids.
Wow! That's pretty sassy!
So you've been
braided a lot lately?
No!
I know gay men,
- I practically invented them.
- Okay.
There's no such thing
as a straight guy
with a gay best friend
he's not fucking.
Don't give me that look.
My friend, Tom, who is single,
if you're interested,
he's the first to agree.
Right. Okay.
Thanks for the tip, but I'm not
particularly interested in Tom.
Unless, of course,
he has your eyes.
So, there's actually a chance
that he didn't hate my guts
and I could be having
his children on that
kick-ass buttercup loveseat.
Which is where you come in.
It was, like, great!
Next she'll ask me to blow
some guy from "3 Day Blinds."
In the movies, when a guy's
in the supermarket
and he accidentally bumps
shopping carts
- with the love of his life?
- Uh-huh.
The last few times
I've bumped carts with anyone
they looked to be
fresh off the special bus.
That is why I let my friends
fix me up.
( phone ringing )
Machine: Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.
- ( beep )
- Eli, are you there? Buddy?
That's right. There's
an X-Files marathon on.
I cannot believe I'm friends
with a trekkie, it's pathetic.
I am not a trekkie!
You got that?
I just like the X-Files.
I believe the truth
is out there, don't you?
Whatever,
I fully hooked you up.
You have a date
on Friday night.
Wait a minute!
What?
That's right. Your losing streak
is over, my man.
He's a tall stud,
a big guy.
Okay, you always say that.
It's like entry-level.
It means he's got nipples.
Maybe that'd be a step up.
Ha ha, that's funny.
His friend, Jackie, came
into the store,
I completely hit it off.
Yikes! Let me tell you,
she's got unbelievable KB.
What is that, killer butt?
No, killer boobs.
She told me about
her friend, Tom,
sounds like a nice guy.
I lied and said you were
a great guy. I told her about you.
That's real nice.
Now you two have
to go out Friday.
Wait a minute! Says who?
Can I call you back?
I'm at my loser
gay friend's place.
Funny.
It didn't go so well
last time with... Richard, was it?
Rita, from UPS!
She was a woman!
Whatever!
She's still gay!
That's your problem,
you're so picky.
You, yourself, said
she had KB.
Killer boobs?
No, butt.
The whole initial thing
has got to stop.
And, PS, I never said KB,
I said KGB.
Killer garlic breath.
Bottom line, I made
a reservation for you, for Tom,
Friday night, Annette's, 8:00,
be there, be square.
I hate it when people say that
'cause even when I'm there,
I'm square, so where's the incentive?
He's a teacher, sounds like
a great guy.
Maybe you'll get lucky,
have to stay after class.
Detention?
You'd like that.
- That's really funny.
- Discipline, gravity boots...
Of course, you went.
Yup, I went.
( upbeat music playing )
- She landed on my roof, -
- Mad love from Venus -
- Her ship ran out of gas, -
- Fast as lightning,
love came between us -
- Fashion girl
from outer space, -
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong. -
- Future love! -
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -
- Making future love tonight -
- That's right, that's right,
that's right -
- Making future love tonight -
- It's all right if I love you -
- It's all right if I don't -
- I'm not afraid
that you're running away -
- 'Cause I got the feeling
honey that you won't -
- Super sonic safety valve, -
- Chorus: I'll never do you wrong -
- That's right, that's right,
making future love tonight -
- That's right, that's right. -
Eli: I didn't have
high hopes for this date.
Receptionist: You didn't have
anything to lose.
Eli: I know. Honestly,
all I kept thinking was,
"I hope he doesn't smoke."
I'm going to get another drink.
Do you want something?
Yes, I'd like another
seltzer with lime.
- Seltzer with lime.
- Make it a wine spritzer.
Spritzer. Got it.
On second thought,
can I get a Seven and Seven?
Rocks with a twist.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I always get
a Seven and Seven.
Hi, we're going to have-
Absolut martini up, two olives,
make it a little dirty.
You?
Do you like movies?
Yeah, I like movies.
Yeah, me too.
I think it was gay night
on cable last night.
"In and Out" was on again.
Uh-huh.
I thought it was great to see
a movie like that with two guys.
Not with two guys... two guys who...
you know, in the movie-
I hated it.
Oh, yeah, me too.
I thought it was light, fun.
- Fun?
- Yeah.
Fun to see Kevin Kline get on
his sorry-ass middle-aged knees
and give us a big old
Hollywood blowjob by catering to
every clichéed homophobic
stereotypical idea of
what it means to be gay?
Without having the decency
or the courtesy,
or even just the balls
to drop a little trou
and show us his.
Wait a minute, come on!
I thought it was nice to see
a guy coming out to his family,
his friends, not to mention
his fiancée.
His fiancée? This loser bitch
has been waiting her whole life
to marry this Nellie barber
loving, self-hating,
geriatric English teacher
who can't get it up for her,
and we're supposed to
feel sorry for her?
Aw.
No fucking way!
I mean, you do the math.
Where's the waiter
with my drink?
You want anything?
I'm not even going to mention
"Bird Cage."
- Can I get a diet coke?
- Sure.
All right. What was
your favorite movie of all time?
Let's just start with that.
I'm not a big fan
of the "favorites" game,
so why don't you go first?
Oh. Okay.
I know it sounds corny and
cliché, but I have to say
"Gone with the Wind."
I never saw it.
Yeah, right.
I didn't. I never saw
"Gone with the Wind."
You're kidding, right?
No, I'm not kidding.
Come on!
- I never saw the movie.
- You never saw the movie?
No, I never-
Okay, fine.
Want me to say
I saw the movie?
I will.
I saw the movie.
It was the best movie
I've ever seen.
Especially that part where
Red Buttons is up on a hill
with Charlotte?
Oh my God, you are scaring me.
What do you want me say?
I'm not a big fan of
black and white movies.
Relax, relax.
I saw "Family" 1 5 times.
Does that help?
It's a start.
KE.
- What?
- What?
What did you just say?
Nothing.
You said something.
No, I didn't.
Yeah, you did.
You said "K," what is that?
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
It's stupid.
It's initial talk.
Bret and I have done it
for years.
It's stupid. It means nothing.
Trust me.
So I just took a hit.
No, you didn't.
Tom, believe me.
I swear to you.
Oh, damn it.
It means...
killer eyes, okay?
I'm gonna go, it's late,
and uh...
Yeah, let's you and I go
on our way- ways.
On our ways, separate,
you and me.
- Here, let's split it.
- No, I got it.
- No, let's split it.
- No, I want to do this.
- Please.
- Let me pay.
- Let me just split it.
- Let me do this.
- Let me pay for my own.
- Just go!
Going.
He hated me.
It was like I activated
his gag reflex.
That is the last time I let you
fix me up, you got that?
Next date I go on will
cost me $2 for the 1 st minute
and $1 .50
each additional minutes.
Did he mention
me and Jackie?
What?
No. It didn't come up.
Are you sure the guy
was even gay?
Are you kidding?
I don't know, with you...
How many straight guys
pretend their gay?
- Besides you?
- Hello!
He didn't
mention me?
You want eggs?
I'll add another.
Are there eggs?
- Yeah!
- Relax.
You're becoming crazy.
You've been whipping
for 20 minutes.
Your mother told me
you would be like this.
My mom called you again?
What did you tell her?
She's concerned about you.
You never talk to the woman.
She thinks you're becoming
a big loser.
That's nice, that's great.
Thanks, thanks for that.
It's easy for her to say.
I know what's out there.
Guys with
bad hair plugs,
staples in their dicks,
Beanie Baby collections
or worse.
- Worse?
- Oh, there's worse.
Come on, it'll be
so much better next time.
There won't be a next time.
Unless his name is
Ben, Jerry, or Jose Cuervo.
Uh-huh. Like you haven't all
ready had those guys.
And their brothers.
Haven't you ever wondered
what it's like
to be with the same guy
for more than five minutes?
The guys I meet, five minutes
is all it takes.
Charming.
More importantly...
what did Eli say about me?
Is it going to happen
with Bret?
I've no idea.
He didn't mention it.
Oh.
Like I care.
Maybe I should call Bret
and find out
what Eli said about your date.
I couldn't care less.
Right. Right.
We officially don't care.
I get it. Yeah.
I definitely
am not going to call.
Where're you going?
Home, to officially not call.
No, no, no. You were supposed
to stay here and watch
Lifetime Television
for women and gay men.
Uh, no.
It's Joan Van Arc and
not without my nose job.
Oh, angel,
I've all ready lived that movie.
That shit people say
about finding the one?
I'm sick of it.
Tom certainly isn't.
I don't think I'll ever
meet the one.
Your whole problem is
there is no such thing
as "the one."
You're such a liar.
Two seconds ago you told me
this girl Jackie is the one.
I met her one time.
She could be the one.
Or one of the ones.
There's notjust one one.
There's fractions of one,
half ones, quarter ones.
The idea is to make yourself
open to someone.
Perhaps Tom is a one.
Are you going to the flea
market with me tomorrow?
No, sweetie. By tomorrow, I'm
hoping to have plans with a man
who'll appreciate me
for my body,
notjust my brains and wit
and sense of style.
So, Dad's in town.
You're disgusting.
Why don't you take a date
to the flea market?
Ugh!
That is why
you never go steady.
I haven't gone steady
since the seventh grade.
You do the math.
Besides, he kept saying,
"You do the math,"
even if it made no sense.
What a turn off!
What's a turn on?
Per your mother,
you haven't had a hard-on
since you saw the Nutcracker
at the Jewish Community Center
in the first grade.
- You talk about my sex life?
- What sex life?
- I have one!
- Uh-huh.
- It counts.
- Right.
I spent 1 0 years learning
which buttons to push,
now I just look at myself
and I come.
( music playing )
- Everybody's looking for
something -
- Step right up and tell 'em
what it's all about -
- Don't you worry
'bout nothin' -
- If you see what you like -
- I'm sure we'll work it out -
- I'll come and see you
on Sundays -
- Eastside, westside,
uptown or down -
- And all your problems
will disappear -
- When you lay
your money down -
- Let's make a deal, man. -
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm good.
How are you?
Yeah, good.
You look good.
God, thanks.
No, no, really.
So, you were lying
the first time?
What?
No, you've got that fresh
Sunday-morning-read-the-paper-
cup-of-coffee look.
Here I thought I had that stale
Sunday morning-hangover-choke-
on-my-own-vomit thing going.
What are you here for?
Looking for anything
in particular?
Yeah. I'm looking for
a vintage martini set.
The shaker and the glasses.
The whole thing.
How about you?
You just browsing?
Me? Are you kidding?
I'd go nuts.
I have to look for one thing
and just one thing.
And that would be what?
A bathroom, actually.
I bet they don't have
bathrooms.
Probablyjust porta-potties.
God, I hate those.
My parents rented
four of them
for my sister's bat mitzvah.
You didn't come here
for a bathroom.
I didn't?
Okay.
I'm looking for an original
Cornelius action figure.
You know, from
"Planet of the Apes"?
You're yanking my chain, right?
Actually, no I'm not.
And I really hate
that expression.
Nice seeing you.
See you around.
No, no don't.
Come on,
have a sense of humor.
You're funny.
I'm not laughing at you.
Not funny bad,
you're funny good.
Why don't we
go grab a cup of coffee,
then I'll help you
find your dolly?
Action figure!
Is itjust the apes,
or do you have Betsy Wetsy too?
Jackie didn't say
you collected dolls.
Interesting. Bret didn't tell me
you were an asshole.
Speaking of which,
what's up with those two?
- Hi.
- Hi.
I thought you should know-
they hated each other.
Oh... right,
more than life itself.
N-no fucking chemistry.
I had the biggest
"Planet of the Apes" collection
until the sixth grade
when my parents made me sell it
at a garage sale.
They were afraid
it was going to adversely affect
my psycho-sexual development.
They're both shrinks.
- Know what did it?
- What?
Affect your psycho whatever?
I'm gay, aren't I?
So the apes made you gay?
I don't know.
What is that, the ape theory?
You've got a half-naked
Charleton Heston in a cage-
Where he belongs.
plus, my huge crush
on Roddy McDowall,
and those cute little
leather outfits?
That, my friend, is a gay,
pre-teen Happy Meal.
- Do you have any martini sets?
- I'm afraid not.
I gotta admit, I don't even know
what a martini set looks like.
I wouldn't know a martini
if it bit me in the ass.
It shouldn't, if you know
how to make them.
I take it you do?
In my house, you had to.
I couldn't tie my shoes
until I was 1 0,
but I could make a martini.
I was Isaac on our sinking
little Love Boat.
Thank you, sweetheart.
This is perfect.
Tell me, have you met any nice
girls at school this year?
Yeah, they're nice.
Have you given any thought
to what we talked about?
None of the other fifth graders
know what they'll do
after high school.
What do I care about a bunch
of pansy fifth graders
with silver spoons
in their mouths?
I sorta like the idea of
teaching. Teaching sounds good.
That's terrific, honey.
( mother chuckling )
I can't remember them
without a drink in their hand.
When my father used to pitch
baseballs to me in the backyard,
he never spilled a drop.
My God, I can't even imagine.
Your parents didn't drink?
No, we never played games
in the backyard.
Never?
First of all,
we didn't have a backyard.
And second of all, the closest
we ever came to a game was...
the "feel wheel."
Rage is at the top.
Then we move down
to frustration,
confusion, loneliness.
On the other side we have
loving, affectionate, silly.
Eli, you go first.
Take your name,
and put it on the emotion
you're feeling right now.
That's right, Eli.
Don't think. Look inside.
- What are you feeling?
- Right now, go.
Don't think- go!
Go!
Do I have to, Dr. Wyckoff?
Mother: Can you do it
for Mommy?
You'd be walking,
thinking,
"Gee, I feel happy," and you'd
put your flag on the wheel?
No, no, it was just...
something my parents
wanted us to do
so that they would feel
more enlightened.
Like getting us to say penis
and vagina at the dinner table.
You know, so that we'd feel
comfortable talking about sex?
It's probably why now I prefer
"pee-pee" and "who-who."
More pee-pee
than who-who, I'd imagine.
Does it show?
I don't think that game would
have been a hit in my house,
unless there was section
on the wheel for thirsty.
There was a section
on the wheel for scared...
but you'd have had
to share that one with me.
No chance on the Eli
and Tom thing?
What a pain.
The gays are so picky.
No, it's Eli. He's got
the worse D.K. on the planet.
Donna Karan?
No, "dating karma."
It sucks.
He told me that, A, he thinks he
insulted Tom a hundred times,
and B, that he's straight.
Tom is just a freak.
He officially hates any guy
that he likes,
or worse, who likes him.
What, dude?
Welcome to the wonderful
world of self-hate.
And he's not even Jewish.
What on God's earth is this?
That's the ugliest thing
I've seen in my entire life.
( clattering )
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.
What's the hurry?
Today is decoupage day
at school and I'm late.
Okay.
Listen, I just...
want to apologize
for yesterday, and last night,
and it shouldn't
have happened.
Oh.
I feel we got off
to a really good start,
but then I feel like
I fucked things up.
So I promise it won't ever
happen again.
Good, I-
We shouldn't have.
Anyway, it was both
of our faults, so...
No, yeah, so let's pretend
it never happened.
Perfect.
Great. I'll see you later.
- Hey.
- How you doing?
( modem connecting )
We had a great time.
I don't get it.
Looked like you did get it-
something called "laid."
FYI, gay guys don't necessarily
play the same bases
that straight guys do.
It's still fucking, dude.
Hello, gentlemen.
You don't mind if the brother
hangs out, do you?
- I had him fixed.
- Do I have a choice?
I don't get the double standard.
Guys can do all kinds
of things with women,
but they don't call it sex
unless they actually fuck.
Like sex with interns.
I'm notjudging you.
It's just sex.
I'm not being defensive,
I'm trying to explain to you
that a guy can get together
with another guy and do all
kinds of things,
without necessarily...
you know.
Right. That's enough.
It's a big step.
I know couples who have never,
and probably will
never actually...
NT- new topic.
What is with you? You were
never this squeamish in college.
That's because you were
dating women.
It's the same thing
if you don't count the vaginas.
I count them. Four, so far.
Know what, Mitch?
It doesn't count if they have
inflate nozzles.
It's not like you picked them up
at Ye Old Cock 'N Balls,
and got out the butter spray
and choke collar
and the whole thing.
You spent an afternoon together.
Obviously he likes you.
Right.
Fuck, these are new.
What's the matter?
Are you cranky?
I don't want to do this anymore.
That's fine. That's great.
You did a terrific job.
Listen, what are you doing
on Friday night?
Are you gonna go out
with the guy?
I don't know.
Why, did Jackie say something?
I don't know, but if you come
on Friday night,
she can tell you herself.
I'm not doing that.
That's so seventh grade.
You'll catch up.
- Did she invite Tom?
- No, it's just us,
it'll be fine.
7:00 Friday night, all right?
All right. Take this.
Have a Valerian or something.
Take a nap.
He's too intense.
I like him as a friend, but-
Bullshit.
That is just fear of intimacy,
which is so 1991 . Pause.
- Marie?
- Yeah?
Put the headphones on.
The headphones.
There you go.
Nice, Marie, but I need
more smile and less sell.
Have fun.
Great... fun, right.
Top notch.
The way you did
in the audition, remember?
The reason we hired you?
Right, absolutely.
Good note. Really good note.
Great.
"New Vita-Power Energy Bars
with tasty, chewy goodness
in every bite."
I'm just glad you met a guy
with half a brain in his head.
Let me find the love in that.
Oh, right, there is none!
I'm not the one who
fell in love with a guy
who could only get a job
selling sperm samples
and doing experimental
drug research.
Wasn't he allergic?
Yes, but he was cute
and you know it.
Yeah, when the hives cleared up.
"...during and after
your living and giving life."
Pause.
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?
What are you doing?
You're not Kathleen Turner, okay?
No, I'm not. I'm not
Kathleen Turner. That's right.
I'm me. Is that what you're
saying? I should be me?
No, what I'm saying is that this
isn't Blue Cross, Blue Shield-
it's an energy snack.
So why don't we have,
I don't know... energy?
Energy! Of course!
You're right.
Because it's Vita-Power,
and "Vita" means life.
Correct me if I'm wrong,
my intention should be to have-
to give more life.
Except as a bar.
But Jackie, can I-
my concern is that I'm going
to be over the top.
No, honey, you're so under
the top right now,
it's like you're selling me
a douche.
I'm getting you on the beach
in a floral print dress,
talking about feminine
freshness.
Is that the read
you're going for?
No, that's not.
Those were good word pictures.
Just translate them
for what I need...
good, yeah, I can do this.
I'm just gonna keep going.
You are so mean. You're not
even listening to her.
Yes, I am. She thinks she's
doing books on tape.
- I think she's good.
- Don't change the subject.
Bret and I are cooking dinner
on Friday night.
What are you having?
Shut up, you're coming.
Is "he" invited?
No, just you.
Pause.
That's it. Go home.
You want me to go?
I should go home?
No, you're incredible.
That voice?
Don't even kid yourself-
you're gonna have
a huge career.
I thought... thank you.
Thanks to you!
Jackie's a piece of work.
Bret's a lying sack of shit.
You look good.
I have no idea.
If it's a sports figure,
I'll kill you.
- Julia White!
- No, no, no.
Eli Weizel!
You're actually not my partner.
Come on! Go go go!
What makes you think I know?
Come on! All right, pass!
This one... fuck! Open!
The ex-football player
who allegedly killed his wife.
Oh-oh-oh-oh... "allegedly"?
What, are you nuts?
- Just say it!
- O.J. Simpson.
Yes!
It's like saying Jackie
allegedly got a nose job.
Shut up.
Both of you shut up!
The first name rhymes with this.
Could you never,
ever do that again?
Just say it!
Time! Time, time, time.
Bret, is it maybe time?
- Who the fuck was that?
- I bet it was one of Brad's.
They're so hard,
because he's so smart.
Apparently not smart enough
to know you had a nose job.
- I told you about that.
- No, you didn't.
So what's the diff?
Come on, Bret,
like you couldn't tell?
Every Jewish teen-age girl with
money winds up with that nose.
Don't you think
it's a little bit weird
that everyone on the planet
knows but your boyfriend?
Seriously, Eli, who was that?
I was doing the hula, so-
It's a little strange. Right?
They used to call me the jackal.
So I got a nose job.
Are you happy now?
I give up, what
rhymes with hula?
Jackal? That's brutal.
You're being a jerk.
But I'm being an honestjerk,
so that counts for something.
Wait, shh! You hear that?
That's the sound of you
not getting laid tonight.
Bret: That's wonderful.
Did you guys hear that?
That was the sound
of Jackie being a bitch.
Did you guys hear that?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Jackie: What do you want
from me?
How about a little honesty?
The self-pity bus stops
right in front of my building.
Don't miss it.
Maybe I'll get
on the self-pity bus-
- You do that!
- and maybe I'll get a transfer.
Can we get outta here
before they start
looking like my parents?
- Fine with me.
- Your place?
Yeah, okay-
Was that Tallulah Bankhead?
No, Rula Lenska.
Rula Lenska.
Who the fuck is Rula Lenska?
Guess they made up.
Hope she paid for Scotchgard.
Don't do that.
No, not right now.
Eli: Like when people say
"excetera" instead of "et cetera."
What is that, "excetera"?
It's crazy.
My favorite is
"for all intensive purposes."
That's nuts. It's like,
"Where did you go to school?"
Are you sure you don't
want a sandwich?
I don't know how you could
eat that food.
No offense, but Jackie
can't cook for shit.
No wonder Brett's
losing weight.
Hollywood News.
Where's your section?
- No, you don't have to.
- Come on.
It's embarrassing.
That's it, right there.
Look at that, "Police Blotter,
edited by Eli Wyckoff."
I don't want you to...
"Juan A. Maas, 35,
arrested early Sunday for DUI.
Blood alcohol level was 2.1
when suspect was
apprehinded' by LAPD."
What?
It says "apprehinded."
No, it doesn't.
It's apprehended.
It says apprehinded.
Oh my God! Shit!
To apprehind,
that's what...
that's when they grab
the guy on the ass?
God damn it, I proofed this
like a million times! God!
Relax.
- Do you know what you need?
- A newjob.
No, you need a drink.
A drink. A real drink.
Do you have any vodka?
I don't know.
Is this vodka?
I've had it since 1947.
Do you have martini glasses?
Those are my martini glasses...
and myjuice glasses
and my water glasses.
Never mind, they'll do.
I am going to introduce you to
the wonderful world of martinis.
( phone ringing )
No, screen, screen.
- Let me get it.
- Let the machine get it.
I bet you can't do it.
I can do it.
I dare you.
All right.
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.
I gotta get that piece
of shit machine fixed.
Eli, this is Dr. Wyckoff.
There's something wrong
with your machine.
- That's your shrink?
- My mom.
You refer to her-
It took her 1 2 years
to get her Ph.D.
She likes to hear
herself say it.
- Now move.
- No.
Move, I'm serious.
It's not funny.
I was just reading the
New England Journal of Medicine
and there's a pullout section
on the new TSE-
Testicular Self-Examine. How to
make it part of your lifestyle.
- My God.
- Do you want to try?
No, come on. Goddamn it!
I faxed a diagram
over to your office.
I put your name all over it.
- Oh my God.
- Oh my God.
Don't listen, don't listen.
...the hues just hit you
right in the face.
You may want to give yourself
an exam while I read aloud.
I think we should
do this exam together.
Let's take a deep breath
together.
Start by lifting the penis
to one side.
Oh my God!
Slowly roll the testicle
between the thumb and fingers,
applying slight pressure.
Hello, Mom, it's me.
Mom: Who?
- Eli?
- Eli, are we screening?
Yeah-no, I wasn't actually.
We just got in.
Mom: "We"?
What does that mean?
Eli: Can I call you back?
Mom: Do we have company?
Yes.
Mom: Jewish?
No, but...
Cute?
Eli: Will you stop?
Mom: Wear a condom.
Oh, God, Mom, no,
it's not like that.
Mom: You hear
about the TSE?
Did you hear
what I was talking about?
Yeah, we both did. Thanks.
Maybe you both could
do it together then,
nothing wrong with helping each
other with a testicular exam.
- Mom.
- Don't be shy.
I got to call you later, okay?
Wait a second, honey.
Call me tomorrow morning-
Goodbye.
I feel so dirty.
So, why does it matter
if I'm Jewish?
You heard that?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, my God.
I'll be in the bathroom,
hoping to God that I can
overdose on Tums or Maalox
or pine scented Glade.
I'm so embarrassed.
Don't be.
It wasn't that bad.
Eli: Really?
It was funny, actually.
Call Mom for me.
I can not talk to her.
The woman stopped having
boundaries
when she stopped
wearing a bra.
And the fact
that I know that-
I know, it's scary.
Does she pull that shit
with you?
Are you kidding?
She wanted me
to tape my first time
for her evaluation.
Eli: And?
I'm not telling you.
Did I tell you she sent me
this article
about circle jerks
and the new safe sex?
Can you believe
I thought circle jerks
was a figure skating term?
It is among
the male figure skaters.
Will you please
call her for me, please?
I can't talk to her.
You can't fight it.
The more you avoid her,
the more she's going
to insist on meeting- what's
your boyfriend's name?
Tom, and he's not my boyfriend.
Whatever.
I don't know
what he is.
What do you want him to be?
It's like...
I just wish I knew,
one way or the other.
Okay, put the bong down,
space cowboy.
He's your fucking boyfriend,
just like I said.
Tom: Eli!
( music playing )
- When you said to me -
- You are not so old -
- Did I know it then? -
- 'Cause I've just been told -
- I didn't think I'd find you -
- Perfect in so many ways -
- But I've been waiting... -
What's with you
and nudity?
Nothing,
but that movie was pandering.
It was an art film.
Yeah, the art of guys
with six-pack abs
blowing each other
every chance they get.
Every gay guy in LA
is "run don't walk."
The problem with that is...?
You might as well
stay home and watch
"The Hand that Rocks My Ladle."
Or "Pocahoncho."
At least those movies
don't pretend to be
what they're not.
You have those?
Pop them in.
Oh, God!
You're part of the problem.
Let me get this straight,
you think a movie about two guys
can't be about love, just sex?
Those guys were in love.
But it was
a special kind of love,
The kind of love
that required latex.
Oh my God.
Never mind.
I can't argue
with a guy who never saw
"Gone with the Wind."
What is that?
God, would you relax?
You're gonna have
an aneurysm.
You are infuriating.
You don't have to-
Do you want me to stop?
No.
You always smell so good.
Okay, there you go.
So Saturday is tennis, right?
Must be an open from Australia,
British, Pakistani, right?
Is something wrong?
No, I just want
to watch TV.
That's okay,
I get it.
Get what?
Same as usual.
The whole
come-here-go-away routine.
Do you want me
to keep massaging you? I will.
But I tell you,
this isn't the way
to get me to want to.
Tom, it's actually fine.
You're not attracted to me,
you want to be just friends,
I can handle that.
But then stop
fucking calling me,
inviting me to see semi-porn
on a Saturday afternoon,
then drive me back to my house,
and start rubbing my shoulders
and expect me to be like,
"Hey, buddy, thanks a lot,
I'll see you around."
What is so wrong with
taking things slow?
Why does it always have to be
all or nothing with you?
I don't know.
All right, then maybe we should
cool it offfor a while.
No, I like you, I do.
Thank you.
I want to have a good time.
I don't want this intense thing.
And you seem to want this...
I don't know,
what do you want?
Eggs, actually.
Whatever.
Remember cooties?
Don't touch the losers
or you get cooties?
And who were the losers?
Easy.
Anybody with a hard-boiled egg
in their lunch bag.
I don't think Tom liked
what I had in my lunch bag.
Eli, let it out.
No, I don't want
to talk about it.
Cop out!
Why do you feel the need
to beat yourself up?
Why won't you
let us into the now?
Why do I feel like I'm in
a cheesy 70s EST seminar?
Good, how else do you feel?
Would you like us
to bring out the feel wheel?
I would actually like it
if you would just leave me alone
for a little while.
Let me in.
I'm not going to hurt you,
I'm your friend.
What is wrong?
I'm fine, okay?
I don't think so.
It's this guy.
I knew it.
He has this reputation
for being sort of easy.
Mm-hmm.
Not with me.
With me, it's hard.
Or not hard,
maybe that's the problem.
Oh, Eli, what is this?
I hate this movie.
David, come in here.
You won't believe
what they're showing again.
What a piece of shit film,
honestly.
- We're supposed to believe-
- They showed it last week.
that this woman is
going to fall in love with
a middle-aged homophobic
self-hating teacher
who's only now discovered
he's gay.
- We hated this movie.
- I don't think so!
Both: Change the channel!
Fuck you!
Hi.
Hi, Sunny.
Oh, honey,
that's so sweet.
Right now the thought offood
makes me want to borscht.
Pretty picture
to wake up to, huh?
Well, A, I can't imagine
waking up to any other picture.
And B...
I don't ever want to have to.
What is this?
Those are capers.
I made them on the side.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit!
Do you...
Oh no, no, no.
Of course I'll marry you.
It's just now everybody's
going to think
we're doing it
because I'm pregnant.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Mr. Preggers!
Wake up, Mr. Preggers!
We should never
have fooled around.
I know, why don't you
have some more wine?
What can I say?
He doesn't make me
weak in the knees.
Please, that is exactly
why you should be with him.
The ones that make you dizzy
are only good for a quick fuck.
The rest are
marriage material.
Like Bret.
That is exactly
what I'm afraid of.
Wait what?
Wow!
Wow, that was fast!
Well, tick-tock, you know?
You're crazy!
I want you to be
my man of honor.
There's no such thing.
So. You're my best friend.
I can't imagine
anybody else by my side.
And your first duty,
as my personal slave,
is to pretend to love it.
Fine, fine.
Jackie: Thanks. I love you.
It's Jackie...
again.
Hello?
Jackie: Where are you?
Call me back, stat.
Message: Hi, this is Tom.
Leave a message, or don't.
- ( beep )
- This is the bride-to-be.
I really wouldn't mind
having my best friend
around right now,
being that it's the most
important time of my life.
But hey, maybe
that's too much to ask for.
- Just to see your face again -
- Just to make you smile -
- Would set me free -
- If I could bring you back -
- That would be
the sweetest thing -
- If I could bring you back -
- To me. -
Freeze!
Jack, Jack, pick up, it's me.
Jackie, please pick up.
I met someone...
apparently.
Fuck!
Listen, Jack,
I'm really sorry I haven't
returned your calls.
I've been a shit, and...
it's me, it's not you.
Like you don't know that.
Jack, I really need
to talk to you.
I'm freaking out here.
Jesus.
This guy has the number eight
tattooed on his-
Wait.
Correction, it says
"Eighth Wonder."
I really know how to pick them.
Jack, please call me back.
Open your eyes
and look at me.
No, I don't think
I will kiss you.
Although you need
kissing badly...
...if the right moment
ever came.
You're a conceited black-hearted
varmint, Rhett Butler.
I don't know why
I let you come see me.
I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
The war can't last much longer.
Really, Rhett? Why?
There's a little battle
going on right now...
( phone ringing )
Hello?
How've you been?
- Okay.
- Good.
Listen...
What?
What I was going to say was
I've been procrastinating
about this whole wedding thing.
I haven't gotten a gift
for Jackie's shower yet.
I guess I'm in denial.
I'm sure it's not
the first time.
Right.
Tom, I never got the email
that our cooling off period
was officially over.
And frankly, I'd like
to renew my option.
- Ummm...
- 'Bye.
- ( phone ringing )
- Fuck, fuck, fuck...
Hi, this is Eli.
Leave a message.
It's Tom again. Listen...
Now he's fucking with me.
That's great.
...mean we can't buy
a baby gift together.
- I hate people like this.
- I know.
They play this game.
Once you decide to play too,
they don't want to play anymore.
What the fuck is that?
I'm starting to think that's
all there is out there anymore.
That's wrong.
No, here's what I think.
I think who I am, what I've been-
is not working so much anymore.
From now on there's going
to be a whole new Eli.
The whole love thing,
I don't buy it.
How come it works for me?
You're so full of shit.
It doesn't work for you.
You fall in love with
a different person each week.
My point exactly.
No, you fall in love
with the idea of being in love.
With a married man. To what?
So you can experience the rush
of breaking up a family?
Now you fall in love with a deaf
guy to learn sign language?
Well, I did.
Honey, this does not
constitute sign language.
And then with a woman,
just to piss off Mom and Dad.
How much did that backfire?
That's the year they decided
to run for co-president of p-flag.
You know what? From now it's
going to be one night stands,
casual sex, just a lot
of close friends.
You sound pathetic.
No, for the first time
in my life,
I think I actually make sense.
Great, glad to help you through
the pain. 'Bye-bye.
'Bye. I'll call you later.
Will you tell that other Eli to
give me a call? This one sucks.
( phone ringing )
It's that's him,
you're not going shopping.
FYI, the only reason I'm here
is because your whole
"tires got slashed" story
was so much more believable
than the first 1 3 messages
you left me.
I thought I had you with
the tickets to X-Files on Ice.
I already saw it.
I always wanted one
when I was a kid.
Surprising, huh?
Oh my God,
I had so many dolls.
My dad would've killed me.
- Really?
- Yeah.
My house was like
a free-for-all.
My sister had all these
Barbies and Kens,
and my parents made me
play with them.
Your parents forced you
to play with dolls?
It was just so I could learn
the names of all the body parts.
Pick whichever doll you like.
It's your choice.
They're all beautiful.
Good. Now switch.
What do you call this?
Vagina!
Yes, vagina.
Good, Rayna. Eli?
Vagina.
Vagina.
Now say it like you mean it.
Va-gi-na.
Vagina.
Yes, yes.
I always thought Ken was gay.
He was when I got through
with him.
That's another story.
You and Ken together
is strangely erotic.
We have been known to do private
shows, if you're interested.
Not today.
O-kay.
Hello there, Eli.
I'm Fuzzy Wuzzy the bear.
Jackie would love this bear.
Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear,
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy, was he?
Was he? Was he? Was he...
- was he, was he-
- Wuzzy.
Wuzzy! Wuzzy!
That's what I said.
No, you said, "was he."
It's Wuzzy.
What's the difference?
You're kidding, right?
You just establish that
Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair.
Why would you
then ask "was he"?
Like a question, like you didn't
know if he was fuzzy or not.
It is a question. I am asking
if Fuzzy is or isn't fuzzy.
What is so wrong about that?
It is a rhetorical question.
There is no answer to it.
It's supposed to be ironic.
Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't
very fuzzy... wuzzy?
I don't think it's that obvious
that Fuzzy Wuzzy was
or wasn't fuzzy.
It is the point
of the whole goddamn thing.
Why are you so uptight?
I'm not.
There always has to be
a right way with you
and a wrong way with you.
Is that why you like
being with me?
So you can feel like
you're right all the time?
What? No.
Is that what you think?
Alls I know is you have
this rigid idea of how I should be.
"Alls you know"?
All right, I can't.
Fuck!
This is mine mine mine!
I love this.
Enjoy it now,
because in a month or so,
you're going to be
ripping at the seams.
( woman laughing )
I'm gonna kill you.
Rachel, could you shut
the fuck up?
You're cackling like an idiot.
Liz, grab some bows and help us
with the rehearsal bouquet.
Why do you want me to do it?
'Cause you think it's the only
time I'll get to hold one?
Liz, what time is therapy, hon'?
Do they make house calls?
That's really sweet.
Very supportive.
I'm taking my gift back.
I'll make it, I'll make it.
- Thank you, nice person.
- Thank you, Tom.
( knocking )
Wait, the door!
Get the door!
Is Jackie here?
Woman: Jackie, did you forget
to pay some parking tickets?
- Are you Jackie Gold?
- I'll be Jackie Gold!
Jackie: I'm gonna
kill you guys.
I can't believe you did this.
Jackie, you have been a bad,
bad, bad girl, haven't you?
- Oh baby!
- ( dance music playing )
Put that thing away.
Jackie: You work that booty!
This is it!
That is going to be amazing.
Enough with the pictures.
No, it's great!
Just one more!
- Ring!
- Okay.
Forget about it, can we talk
about our friend the cop?
Rachel: You mean your future
ex-husband?
Tom: So how long have you
been doing this?
- Too long.
- Yeah?
Woman #1 : Let me ask you this...
how many of these gifts
can I take home with me?
Woman #2: You're crazy.
Woman #1 : I wrap beautifully,
though.
Woman #2: Don't you think we
should share?
You don't even like mine.
Can I take it back?
Excuse me one second.
So, you know, I've been
kind of bad myself.
You have?
( tires screeching )
- Please forgive me
if I act a little strange -
- For I know not what I do... -
( doorbell ringing )
- Feels like lightning running
through my veins -
- Every time I look at you... -
Hey.
Hey.
How much do I owe you?
$9.22.
Why don't you keep that?
- Thanks a lot.
- Have a good night.
You too. Thanks.
- And there's so much
I want to say -
Wanna tell you
just how good it feels... -
- Hey.
- Hi.
Where did you find this?
Internet.
Thank you.
I took it out of the box
so you could play with it.
It came in a box?
- The original box?
- Mm-hmm.
Where is it?
I tossed it. Why?
Why?
Never mind.
Tom: And then it happened.
What?
We went where no two men should
ever go without a prescription.
Trust me, you don't want
the details.
Are you nuts?
At my age, the details
are all I got.
Take off your...
Ouch!
Sorry.
- Let's not...
- What?
- Let go of my leg.
- Sorry, sorry.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Wait.
Don't you want to?
Do you have a thingy?
Shut up.
You know what I mean.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah.
- Tom?
- Yeah?
Look at me.
I... love you.
Oh my God.
I love you.
Oh my God!
I'm hungry.
Yeah?
You like eggs? Why don't
I make some eggs?
I'm supposed to meet my parents
at the country club for brunch.
Do you want to come?
Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Dad.
- Tom.
This is Eli.
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Hello, Eli.
- Hi.
Nice to meet you.
Why don't we all sit down?
Lydia and I can share a menu.
I'll get another setup.
You guys want coffee
orjuice or anything?
Yeah, coffee with milk.
Can I get a mimosa and a coffee?
And a water.
You'll fill up on liquids.
Save room for your meal.
- Leave him alone, Lydia.
- I wasn't criticizing.
He's obviously old enough
to please himself.
So... what have you guys
been up to?
Not much, really. We got back
from Keenan on Friday...
and then I took the girls
from my church group
to see "Phantom of the Opera."
Is that still running?
It was Friday night.
Right, I didn't know.
Father: $75 a shot.
It's absurd. It's like throwing
money in the trash.
- It's theater, Jim.
- It's trash, Lydia.
Tom: All right, all right.
How was it up at Keenan?
What? What's wrong?
Now's not the time, honey.
So there's a right time
to ask about Amy?
- Stupid.
- Excuse me?
You heard me, Lydia.
You talk to me like that,
you'll see what you get from me.
Is that a threat, Lydia?
- Dad, could you not-
- Shut up, Tom.
Mother: That's rich.
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.
Let go of me,
don't do that.
Don't do that,
get your hands off me.
- I told you do not...
- You always do this...
Let's go.
Tom, the valet's that way.
I'm not ready. If you want
to go, I'll take a cab.
It's a nice club.
You think if
I were half Jewish,
they'd let me halfway
in the pool?
I'm really sorry.
You didn't do anything.
Who's Amy?
She's my sister.
What? I didn't know
you had a sister.
I have a sister- Amy.
She lives up north
in a special needs facility.
- Was she in an accident?
- No, no.
F.A.S. Do you know
what that is?
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
Any other questions?
I'm on your side, remember?
I don't want anyone
on my side, remember?
You thinkjust because we
fucked, that makes us "we"?
I didn't ask for this,
for you. Sojust stop.
You called me, remember?
So make up your fucking mind.
How many ways do you need to be
told to leave me the fuck alone?
You know what, asshole?
Just one.
Alls I know is-
all I know is if I wasn't
loaded half the time,
I probably wouldn't be
in this mess.
Don't you feel like
the older you get,
the less you really
know about anything?
Absolutely. I don't know shit.
People thinkjust because
I managed to make it to 60
without getting
a Colombian necklace
or getting run over
by a UPS truck,
that I have the answers
to life's questions.
Great, so there's
no hope.
Don't do that.
I'm not that Deepak Chopra
or whatever the hell
he calls himself.
He tells you, if you believe
in yourself,
you can do anything- pish!
Alls I know is, you keep your
two eyes on your own paper
and both hands on the wheel.
And a multi-vitamin
can't hurt.
So I guess the lesson's the same
with booze as it is with guys.
Wanting it and having it...
totally not the same thing.
I'll be right back.
The bathroom.
Hey.
Sometimes I think
you can want it and have it.
And now what happens now?
Now?
You mean about Eli
being at the wedding?
That's not what I meant.
Wait, wait, wait.
You made me wait too long.
Think too much about it.
Told you... negative.
Great.
I guess that's it.
It's nice meeting you.
You'll be seeing a lot more
of me, you'll see.
Now that I'm off relationships
and just doing one night stands.
Yeah, sure.
Take a condom.
We used to put candy in this.
Anyway, sorry I talked
your ear off.
Please, it's better than
a fucking movie, sweetheart.
Don't you need
a parking validation?
Right, thank you.
- ( phone ringing )
- Wait a second.
Feedback Clinic,
this is Esther.
Hi, honey, how you doing?
What? Go ahead, ask me.
I'm not a mind reader.
You ever see me on the fucking
Psychic Friends Network channel?
Would... would you just
shut up for a minute?
So don't tell me.
Trust me, Esther-
one night stands.
It's all black and white
for you, isn't it?
What?
I have been married
to that putz for 42 years.
The strongest, healthiest man
all his life.
And all of a sudden,
he gets sick.
Lung cancer.
He never smoked a day
in his life.
Pretty fucking ironic, isn't it?
He's even got a someone taking
care of him in the afternoon.
Just like a little boy.
But he's dying, and if I stop
hawking him and giving him shit,
calling him asshole,
he'll know he's dying.
So I don't stop.
Plus, he is an asshole,
so that's a bonus.
So I've got my grandmother's
ring. That's old and borrowed.
And Rachel got me
that blue thong.
Hoochie floss.
You got something else
that's new and blue?
Actually, I do.
Holy shit, Tom!
What happened?
Bad date.
What did you do,
pick him up on the street?
Worse- AA.
Apparently he uses sex
to work through anger,
which is fine when you're
not quite that angry.
What am I going to do with you?
Give me that.
I smell a lecture.
Fuck you, Tom.
You blow off a great guy who,
by the way, doesn't hit
because he made the tragic
mistake offalling for you.
And instead you're doing
Ike and Tina Turner
with some asshole from AA.
At least he's not
at Williams Sonoma
registering for our
commitment ceremony.
You're right. You're right,
Eli is such a loser.
I'm going home.
Holy shit.
- What's the matter?
- What? Nothing.
Bullshit. Why aren't you
getting dressed?
I'm nervous about seeing Tom
at the wedding, that's all.
Only you could turn my wedding day
into the Eli Wyckoff show.
I'm sorry. Believe me, nobody
can hate me as much as I do.
Oh my God, you have
to change the fucking record.
You have to stop.
You cannot make this the be-all and
end-all of your entire life.
I'm not.
That's exactly
what you're doing.
Let me tell you something.
Love is going to come
up and whack you
- in the head before you know it.
- I don't believe that.
- That happened to me and Jackie.
- You were lucky.
You're unbelievable.
I was miserable before I met
her, and itjust happens.
You're a fucking amazing guy.
You don't have
to do this, don't-
Please shut up.
You're a great guy.
If I were into guys,
we'd be in China right now
picking out a baby.
Thank God I'm not, but...
Kidding. You know
I love the gays.
And we appreciate it.
- Guys?
- Mitch?
I don't know if it's just me,
but I love it.
You like the tux?
Loving it.
Mitch, remember when we
discussed the Ritalin situation?
Please put on your pants...
or get a tan.
Get doubles.
I want all of these.
When my sister got married,
the best pictures were
from the Instamatics.
Your sister got married?
Yes.
Fuck, what is my problem?
I'm like man poison.
Fucking penis Raid.
Whatever!
Girls... how do I look?
Oh my God, you look
like a movie star.
Really?
- Yes.
- Totally.
Seriously.
In a million years,
I never thought I'd be
wearing white this soon.
You shouldn't be, unless
you want me to call the Pope
and tell him
it happened again.
I would've worn the cream one,
except it made me look like
a Jenny Craig "before" picture.
Are you crazy?
Where's Tom?
He's on the patio.
He is a man, after all.
Repellent. Gay or
straight, it doesn't matter.
Put that out. You're killing
my unborn child.
I was aiming a little higher.
Nice. What are you
doing out here?
Oh my God,
Eli was stalking you?
That is so romantic.
Not to me.
That's right.
But if he tried to kill you,
then you'd be picking out
china patterns.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
You're getting married.
I'm having abandonment issues.
I'm just extending
the family, babe.
Woman: Jackie, let's go.
We'll be right there.
Tom, I owe you an apology.
For what?
The way I've been
pressuring you about Eli.
And I realize that
I've just been trying
to make you like everybody else
and you're not.
And that's one of things
I love about you.
You're the only guy I know
who will probably never find
that one person
to settle down with
and still be very happy.
I envy that.
Jackie, get your ass in here
or I'm wearing the veil.
We're coming.
But look at me. Shit!
I'm like one step away
from den mother, PTA,
and "Hi, Honey,
I'm home."
How the fuck
did that happen?
Guess you fell in love.
What?
No, I just got lipstick all over
every single one of my teeth.
How did I do that?
It's show time.
You may exchange the rings.
Wow, that's a nice one.
Congratulations, I now pronounce
you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.
( glass breaking )
Eli.
- Eli.
- Yeah?
How long are we going to have
to keep ignoring each other?
What? I'm not ignoring you.
You ignoring me?
Come on, Eli.
You haven't returned
one of my phone calls.
And you've said maybe three
words to me the entire day,
two of which were
"seafood newburg."
Which I have to say
was repulsive.
Can I get some more Champagne?
Champagne?
No, can I get a-
That's right, I'm sorry.
Absolut Martini, straight up,
two olives. Make it dirty.
No, actually seltzer
with lime, please.
So now you're not drinking?
Wow.
Good for you.
Thanks.
I sorta had to-
I was slipping in the polls.
I, on the other hand,
need more Champagne.
- I'm sorry I didn't-
- Let's not do any of that,
"I'm sorry, it didn't work out"
post-mortem stuff, okay?
Okay.
Besides, it'll free up some time
to make fun of people.
Like Mitch, the man of mystery,
teaching the rabbi the Macarena.
What is this, 1987?
Did you see Bret's mom?
I've never seen a woman
with more hair on her back.
I keep waiting
for the anti-fur activists
to storm in here
and throw paint on her.
Tom: Poor Brett and Jackie.
They have no idea what they've
gotten themselves into.
But they will, mark my words.
First they'll only
hang out with other couples.
Then they'll start doing
the "we" thing.
"We love this,
and we hate that."
And ordering
for each other,
because that's what
"we" always have.
Before you know it,
she'll be shopping for lingerie
at Bloomingdales.
And Brett,
the poor loser,
will be outside
the dressing room
with her pocketbook
in his lap.
Oh my God.
You are so full of shit,
you know that?
You got this bullshit,
"I don't need anyone" thing.
And you use that,
thinking it's going to shield
you from the fact
that your parents were drunks,
had a lousy marriage,
and fucked up everyone
in their lives.
But it's your life now,
not theirs.
And what do you have
to show for it?
You're just another self-hating
recovering alcoholic
with nothing to live for
but a martini and a blowjob.
Eli. Eli!
Hey!
( dishes crashing )
Don't you dare sum me up.
You don't know the first thing
about me.
And that would be who's fault?
God, it's so easy
for you, Mr.,
love-is-a-many-splendored-thing.
But you know what?
I've seen it. I've seen it.
My parents loved one another.
Until death do us part.
And believe me,
it practically came to that.
Have you ever heard the sound
of two people suffocating
one another? Have you?
Or the sound of ice cubes
smashing against the wall?
Or a pot roast being
shoved down the disposal? No!
How could you possibly,
with your touchy-feely "I'm
okay, you're okay" parents.
I'm sorry I'm bursting
your little bubble.
But there are
a million guys out there
who can give you
what you want.
I'm just not one of them.
I'm sorry.
You do the math.
You know what?
Fuck you if that's the wrong use
of that expression.
- If could I bring you back -
- That'd be the sweetest thing -
- If I could bring you back -
- I would do anything -
- If I could bring you back... -
- To me. -
I just wanted to say,
before I go...
I'm sorry.
I don't want you
to leave here today
thinking that you can't
do this-
be in a...
Because you can.
Tom, you are going
to meet someone,
and you're going to be
so great at this.
It's not going to be
like your parents,
and it's not going to be
like it was with me.
Anyway, uh...
I'll see you around.
Eli...
What?
What exactly do you want?
W-what do I...
Yeah... you.
I wanted this to stop
being so fucking hard.
I want to meet your sister.
I want to be over this part,
so I can call you an asshole
even when you're sick,
and you'd still know
how much I love you.
Eli.
I don't know
what you call that, Tom.
Pocketbook holding,
suffocating... maybe.
But if I could ever have
anything even close to that-
Eli!
I'm gonna go.
Valet's got my car.
There you are!
- Eli, hey.
- Hey.
Should I? Or is this...
is everything okay?
Yeah, yeah.
What's up with the braid?
Brett did it.
It's a long story.
I need to take
a personal moment.
What's the matter?
You're not having fun?
I was until
about five minutes ago.
What happened?
I put my left foot in
I put my left foot out
I put my left foot in
and then I threw up.
The baby?
No. Bret's cousin Al
bumped his pokey into my hokey
and I borsched.
I think Brett is the only
normal person in that family.
Can we talk about
his brother Mitch?
Hello, Freakie-McFreak.
He wants tojoin
Cirque du Soleil.
He says he can swallow
his own leg.
What's up?
How you doing?
What am I missing?
Just a family resemblance.
And I love you for it.
Okay. I don't know
what that means.
I'm really smashed...
I think I just made out
with the rabbi.
He is hot.
Is there dancing?
Are we going to dance?
Because I promised the family
some hot man-on-man action.
- You and me?
- No...
I think he means me and you.
Come on guys, let's go.
It's going to be fun.
Come on, sweetheart.
Bret: Look at that ass!
A little something like that...
Eli: I just had my hip replaced.
How hot does this broad look?
Tom: I finally saw
"Gone With The Wind."
And?
And, I loved it.
Oh, thank God.
I think Scarlett realizes
in the end
that it was just fear
holding her back from the guy
that she wanted to...
you know.
Eli: Hold her pocket book?
Yeah.
And I think
about Rhett Butler.
Yeah?
He wasn't very fuzzy.
Was he?
( theme music )
- I'm gonna make you love me -
- I'm gonna dry your tears -
- We're gonna stay together -
- For a million years -
- It's the least I can do -
- Just to make you my baby, -
- No words can describe -
- Ah, pinch me I'm dreamin' -
- Your hair's long and black -
- As it lays cross my pillow -
- When I stare in your eyes -
- I get lost in your glory -
- I'll never be -
- All you want me to -
- But that's all right, -
- I'm gonna make you love me -
- I'm gonna dry your tears, -
- We're gonna stay together -
- For a million... -
- I'm gonna make you love me -
- I'm gonna dry your tears, -
- We're gonna stay together -
- For a million years. -
- If the silence
doesn't kill it, -
- Then illusion will -
- And you're staring
at the sky, -
- But the moon ain't
gonna pay our bills -
- And we're laughin'
'bout it loud, -
- When, oh, you know
it ain't nojoke -
- You see them kick the rose
with glitter, -
- Trade your dreams for smoke -
- Tear drops in the tree tops, -
- The wind is whistling
through the mountain's teeth -
- A soul for every wounded dove -
- We're out further
than the rainbow's edge -
