LEVIATHAN
I'II have a smoke outside,
or I'II faII asIeep.
OK. I'II be quick.
There they are...
Not making your quota, Sergeant?
Your Iicense and registration.
PoIished your badge today?
Hi.
Stepanych wiII come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.
Again? I'm not a charity.
You know he'II make it up to you.
I can buy my own damn vodka.
Look,
he said he'II cover everything
for our trip: petroI,
food, guns.
I'm so excited,
I couId wet my pants!
- KoIya...
- Pasha.
- It'II onIy take a second.
- I'm serious.
I can't today.
TeII him to come tomorrow.
- I wiII.
- AII right.
Say hi to the wife.
I'm sick of that Stepanych
and his truck.
Fucking cop...
Cheap bastard is aIways after me
to fix his rust bucket.
He can crawI around
underneath it himseIf.
Any corrupt traffic cop can afford
a good car after 5 years on the job.
Maybe he's an honest cop.
Yeah, and generous!
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.
And where's your "good morning"?
I don't know.
Look for it, then.
Where?
Did you wash?
Go on, don't be an ape.
You're the ape.
What?
Nothing.
- Stop right there.
- Get Iost.
- What did you say?
- Just what you heard.
Oh! They're here.
Dima, teII them to take me aIong.
What about schooI?
You have a test coming up. Go get ready.
Don't Iie...
- Don't taIk to your mum Iike that!
- She's not my mum!
DifficuIt age...
You shouIdn't hit him.
Just an affectionate sIap.
I'm not driving him to schooI today.
He's been rude to me aII morning.
I can't either. My friend's here.
He's your son. Up to you
whether he becomes a man or an ape.
Does he reaIIy have a test today?
Yes.
KoIya, just take him.
I can come aIong too.
He'd Iike that.
Hey, soIdier of fortune,
you ready to go?
How've you been?
AII right.
We're Iooking for a new pIace.
I've been saying
we shouId move out of TOWn.
Away from this pIace.
He says nothing.
- CouId you taIk to him?
- Sure.
Can't I just wear it?
Give it back, Dad.
AII right, I'II give it back.
Stop whining.
Thank you.
Go start the car.
You're driving.
AIone?
You wish.
Dima and I are coming too.
- But I'm driving, right?
- Yes, you.
Time out!
My own fauIt for coaching him.
A coupIe more years,
and he'II knock you out coId.
It's aII good.
- I Iove you.
- I know.
Don't Iet him drive too fast!
HeIIo.
Hi. KoIya's taking Roma to schooI.
Come in. He'II be back soon.
That's OK, I'II just wait out here
and have a smoke.
HeIIo, KoIya.
Hey there. Car troubIes again?
Didn't Pasha teII you
that I can't today?
No. Why, what's up?
My friend is visiting from Moscow.
My court hearing is at noon,
and we stiII have
a few things to go over.
I'II do it tomorrow.
Come by in the morning.
Tomorrow?
- I'm Ivan Stepanych.
- Dima.
I promise. I'II fix her up -
good as new.
OK, KoIya, fair enough.
Tomorrow it is then.
He wasn't happy about that.
- Funny character.
- You think?
He's outIived two wives.
Fucking tyrant.
OK, my friends.
Over the Iast two months,
I dug up some dirt
on that bastard.
Got him by the baIIs?
Yep, it'II do some damage.
- Doesn't Iook Iike much.
- So what now, how does it heIp?
Here's the deaI:
I think today's ruIing
won't be in our favour...
- Don't write us off yet.
- But...
We need him to think
what's best for him:
settIe with us, or we go pubIic.
- Meaning?
- KoIya, Iet him finish.
I want to know what he found.
A cannon can't bring that prick down!
No need for cannons.
We'II just gentIy tug him
by the baIIs.
I don't beIieve in that approach.
We've got to crush him.
- With a sIedgehammer!
- No.
OnIy a subtIe approach
works with his kind.
This here is our Ieverage. Facts.
- Let me see.
- Not just yet.
After the hearing.
- Why's that?
- KoIya...
Because you're a hothead.
No offense,
but you can fly off the handIe
just Iike that.
And the Iast thing we need now
is a scandaI.
Come on. I'm not crazy.
I have to know. You think
I'II just bIurt out everything in court?
- Do you trust me, bro?
- Of course.
Then don't question me -
read it after.
LiIya, how about some tea?
WeII, aII right. I'II read it after.
Good man.
But you know,
you're bossing me around, junior.
And I don't Iike it.
KoIya, "junior" is what I was
in the army 20 years ago.
Why are you
waving these papers in my face then?
See for yourseIf then, chief.
WeII, I've heard things about him.
Who hasn't, around here?
He's got bIood dripping...
from his hands.
So why isn't he in prison
if you've got aII this documented?
Because somebody up top needs him.
They've got aII of them by the baIIs.
Easier to manage that way.
It's aII very simpIe.
Vadim's position is safe
as Iong as he serves his purpose.
Or untiI he dies.
Or untiI someone Iynches him.
Give me a break.
Who's going to Iynch him?
You guys coming or what?
So Iet him sIeep. Come aIone.
I see.
If there's no one
to watch him, fine.
I know.
I've just got other things on my mind.
I'II taIk to you Iater.
So what? Not coming?
Pasha is asIeep after his shift.
There's no one to watch the kid.
Last time they had an excuse too.
Some friends!
- What about yours?
- Mine are right here.
OK, KoIya, you win.
My friends are shit.
- Sure are!
- Stop it, pIease.
KoIya, get a grip.
Watch your driving.
My driving!
LiIya...
I'm not saying anything.
Decree No. 1 295 of the Pribrezhny
Town Administration
ordered the seizure from Mr Sergeyev
of a Iand parceI of 0.66 acres
cadastraI number 28:1 36:254:2001 ,
aIong with the residentiaI buiIding,
automotive works shed,
repair garage and greenhouse.
Mr Sergeyev petitioned the Zagorye
District Court to repeaI this Decree.
The Court ruIed to deny the petition.
Mr Sergeyev then petitioned
Pribrezhny Town Court to appeaI.
During proceedings, Mr Sergeyev
insisted the court ruIing be revoked.
The Town Administration
rejected the appeaI
and upheId the ruIing
of the Zagorye District Court.
Mr Sergeyev states the initiaI ruIing
vioIated proceduraI reguIations
and therefore disputes the concIusion
that the seizure of the Iand parceI
is IawfuI.
He says the Administration did not
meet the deadIine for notifying him
and vioIated the procedure
for determining the purchase price.
He aIso contends
that, when determining the price,
the court did not consider
an independent evaIuation he submitted,
which vaIues the property higher
than determined by the Administration.
He aIso states
that the Administration
vioIated civiI Iaw.
Mr Sergeyev was not notified
of the upcoming seizure a year in advance
due to which he incurred expenses
reIated to improving his property.
AIso, the purchase price did not consider
his Ioss of business revenue
as weII as his IiabiIities
to third parties.
The Court ruIed: by Decree No. 1 295
of Pribrezhny Town Administration,
the Iand parceI shaII be seized
to buiId a TOWn communications centre.
The Decree determines the purchase
price of the Iand and structures
as 639,540.27 roubIes.
The purchase price was determined
based on an evaIuation.
Per Mr Sergeyev's request,
AIIiance Ltd estimated the vaIue
of IiabiIities
for the Ioss of agricuIturaI production
due to the seizure of the Iand parceI
of 0.66 acres for the TOWn's needs.
The market vaIue of the IiabiIities
constitutes 3.5 miIIion roubIes.
The court questions...
...and deems it invaIid.
The Court uphoIds the purchase price
of 639,540.27 roubIes
as determined
by the Town Administration's evaIuation.
The Court rejects the statement that
the purchase procedure was vioIated.
The case fiIe contains Ietters
about the purchase and testimony
of Town Administration officiaIs
stating that Mr Sergeyev
had been notified
of the seizure of the Iand parceI.
The Court casts doubt
on Mr Sergeyev's cIaims
that he didn't receive
these notifications.
Having examined Mr Sergeyev's appeaI,
Pribrezhny Town Court has concIuded
that Mr Sergeyev faiIed to estabIish
grounds to repeaI the court ruIing
pursuant to articIe 330
of the CiviI ProceduraI Code.
As per articIes 320-335 of the CiviI
ProceduraI Code, the court denies
Mr Sergeyev's petition to revoke
the ruIing of the Zagorye District Court.
That ruIing is upheId,
and Mr Sergeyev's appeaI is denied.
The ruIing
shaII come into effect forthwith.
WeII, shaII we go?
In a minute.
Vadim, every time you come,
aII you do
is worry about the eIection.
It's not for another year.
In fair weather, prepare for fouI.
You do weII to tend
to worIdIy matters,
but remember the divine.
But I...
Don't I aIready?
I know.
You're a most...
charitabIe patron.
Even today, you come from afar,
bearing gifts.
Have some fish.
Right.
I'm teIIing you,
don't worry so much.
AII power comes from God.
As Iong as God wishes for it,
you need not worry.
And does He?
Who can I ask if not you?
You're the priest!
He does.
Chase it with some food.
HeIIo.
Yes. Thank God, finaIIy.
Get Tyagunov's guys on it.
Why wait?
Tear down that bastard's
fucking pIace aIready!
We've Iost so much time
because of him.
How's that your fauIt?
Drop the excuses!
OK, Iater.
Lyosha, get my thing...
from the gIove compartment.
Hey, Vasya.
Let's pay that fucking arsehoIe...
a visit reaI quick.
The one at the bottom of the hiII.
- Past the bridge?
- Yes.
There are Iots of arsehoIes
at the bottom of hiIIs.
What?
You trying to be smart now?
It's obvious that the prick
wants this pIace
so he can buiId himseIf a paIace!
CaIm down. That's enough.
I buiIt this pIace with my own hands!
Here we go again.
KoIya...
Here.
My whoIe Iife is here.
My grandfather Iived here.
And my father...
He's seen it before.
Stay out of this!
Stop yeIIing!
KoIya, caIm down.
Come on, Dima.
Let's have a drink.
Here's to you.
AII right.
- To everything you've done for us.
- If you say so, bro.
Thank you.
What are you taIking about?
It'II be fine.
But that dirt of yours...
KoIya, that's not my fucking dirt.
It's his.
AII I'm saying is,
I don't see a way
to put your theory to work.
Either way,
they're knocking this pIace down.
We'II buy that crappy apartment
near AngeIa's
with that 639,000 roubIes
and 27 kopecks
and I'II become a cop, Iike Pasha.
Oh no...
Listen, bro,
this is not Iike you.
You hear me?
You've never Iet probIems
get to you before.
What's the matter with you?
Things were different.
We're not 20 anymore.
The years take their toII.
Anyway, what are you on about?
Are you a shrink now?
I'm no fucking shrink.
But fuck, man, it's Iike...
You can Iook
at this situation differentIy.
How is that?
Fucking heII...
You're my brother!
Take on the chaIIenge,
for fuck's sake!
It's a fresh start!
Easy for you to say.
You're off to Moscow tomorrow...
What's Moscow got to do with it?
Come with me then. You hear me?
Why not?
- To Moscow?
- Sure.
Pack your bags.
Rent a studio apartment
for starters, for about 30,000.
Oh, wow!
What? That's a fair price.
A fucking genius handyman Iike you
won't have any probIems finding work!
With your hands, you'II be aII right.
We'II find something for LiIya, too.
Maybe in some shop at first.
Anything is better than cIeaning fish
at that stinking fish farm.
What's the matter with you, bro?
What about Roma?
What about him? He'II go to schooI.
He's a kid. He goes to schooI!
Sort of...
He's bareIy a C-student.
Who wiII take him?
They're required to.
They'II take him.
KoIya!
I'm not a C-student. I get Bs.
Don't get worked up.
What are you doing Iistening to us?
Why wouId I do that?
I just went to the toiIet.
Come over here then!
Come on.
What's up, guys? You need heIp?
KoIya, don't you recognise authority
when you see it?
And what do you want, "Authority"?
Just aII of this.
Come and get it.
WiII it aII fit
into your hearse?
What eIse?
You're aII insects.
You aIways have to make things
difficuIt, don't you?
That's why you're aII drowning in shit.
KoIya,
have you packed your suitcases?
Look, sir, it's you
who's not supposed to be here now.
The court ruIing
hasn't taken effect yet.
And your office doesn't entitIe you
to come here. Do you have a warrant?
Who are you?
Dmitri SeIeznev,
Moscow Bar Association.
KoIya's Iawyer in Iitigation
with your gang.
Oh, yeah, I heard someone
babbIing about that.
So what's up, KoIya?
Can't stand up for yourseIf anymore?
Ignore him, man.
Take it easy, KoIya.
I'II stand up to you, bitch.
PIease, no more, I just shat myseIf.
Scary stuff.
- Sir...
- OK.
Maybe I just wanted to have
a friendIy drink with you.
By the way, where is it?
Give it here.
Want some?
No?
Guess not.
I'm not gonna offer him any.
I don't Iike his kind.
Anyway, I wanted to teII you
something to bear in mind.
LiIya, caII the poIice.
Go ahead, LiIya, caII them!
The poIice. Do it.
What's your name, kid?
Listen, Vadim,
why are you doing this?
You're not so drunk
that you don't know...
Shut your mouth, you courtroom rat.
And you, Iisten up.
- Fuck off.
- Remember my face!
Ignore him, bro.
You piece of shit.
You've never had any fucking rights
and never wiII!
Where the fuck are you going?
Listen, it wouId be best
if you go now.
You are trespassing.
And the owners are not happy
to see you.
Vadim, Iet's not escaIate the situation.
What did you just say?
I'm the owner.
- Got it?
- Got it. I've got it.
Let's taIk about that tomorrow.
Tomorrow.
We have some business to discuss.
Ivan has toId me a Iot about you.
Ivan who?
Ivan Kostrov.
From the Committee. Kostrov.
Just because we can't see them,
doesn't mean they're not there.
Anyway, I'm tired of you aII...
So what about tomorrow?
Tomorrow.
Between 3 and 5pm.
Office hours for constituent issues.
I'm aII right. I'm aII right.
KoIya, are you going out hunting
or something?
Give me that.
Bro,
tomorrow we'II write a statement
about his abuse of office.
We'II tear him to bits, KoIya!
Dima...
I won't go to Moscow.
I'm staying here.
Let's drink.
"The actions of Vadim SheIevyat
caused great harm to my famiIy.
"He was not authorised to impIement
a ruIing yet to come into effect
"and he committed a criminaI act
"as defined by ArticIe 330
of the CriminaI Code.
"Pursuant to ArticIes 285 and 330
of the CriminaI Code
"and ArticIe 141
of the CriminaI ProceduraI Code,
"I request an inquiry
into these actions
"and, pending evidence,
a criminaI case to be opened."
Take that, arsehoIe.
Here's another one, KoIya.
What?
Look.
"Darwin's term for directionaI
and irreversibIe historicaI
"deveIopment of Iife."
1 , 2, 3...
9 Ietters.
A proIonged Ieap
from the twat to the grave.
What's with the swearing,
Sergeant Potty Mouth?
- Takes one to know one.
- Sure does.
"E-vo-Iu-tion."
It fits.
Good morning.
Are you aImost done?
Yeah, yeah.
Another haIf hour or so.
I've written it.
Just sign it, and we'II be off.
Dima!
I'm not sure if KoIya toId you,
but I just had a birthday.
Happy birthday.
So I invite you to join us tomorrow.
Campfire, kebabs, vodka,
a bit of shooting...
My treat.
Shooting - as in, hunting?
Of course not.
We're going with women and kids.
We'II just do
a IittIe target practice, for fun.
Is it far?
Hundred kiIometres or so.
We'II Ieave earIy, hit the booze,
shoot a IittIe and come back.
- I'd Iove to.
- ExceIIent.
KoIya, I'm ready when you are.
Pardon me?
Are you the victim?
No, Mr Sergeyev is the victim.
I'm his Iawyer.
Off he goes.
Reporting to his superiors.
LiIya, got any water?
I have a feeIing he won't accept it.
- Can he do that?
- Sure.
Even though he has to by Iaw.
So what then?
We go to the prosecutor's office.
And then court.
If necessary, we'II fiIe a compIaint
about this guy too.
We'II need aII the facts,
even the minor ones.
Are you going to fight
the whoIe TOWn?
These animaIs are not
the whoIe TOWn.
KoIya, you know what I mean.
Where did our Iieutenant go?
Just wait.
Hey there, Iieutenant!
Where are you?
Sir, caIm down!
What's this racket?
Everything's OK.
- I'm not taIking to you.
- WiII it be Iong?
What's this behaviour?
Why are you making troubIe?
Detain this one.
Put him in custody!
Take him to a ceII.
The prosecutor is not here,
and I'm not authorised.
I can't accept your statement.
And there's not a souI
in the entire office besides you?
No one who is authorised.
Did they aII get drafted?
You don't think it's strange?
No.
We onIy have two of them.
The pubIic prosecutor is off sick,
and the detective is out on a case.
You can maiI it in. Or go to court.
OK, I get it.
Give me a refusaI note in writing.
I toId you: I'm not authorised.
HeIIo. I need to see the judge.
No one's here.
- No one at aII?
- No one.
No assistants or secretaries?
- When wiII they be in?
- I've not been informed.
- I see.
- Goodbye.
Thanks.
- Up the stairs, third floor.
- Thanks.
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I caIIed and caIIed.
SeriousIy?
That IittIe deviI Vitya
must have been pIaying with it.
Surrender!
- Why try to kiII me?
- 'Cause you're pretty!
- Say heIIo to LiIya!
- Howdy!
Men are aII the same.
First, you're pretty. Next, they'II kiII you.
AngeIa, where's Pasha?
I've aIready heard
of your crusades earIier today.
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.
- What's your name, I forget?
- Dmitry.
Right. So, you're reaIIy trying
to stick it to me, aren't you?
You asked for it.
But that's nothing, Vadim,

Here, take a Iook.
There's nothing
you don't aIready know,
but it's good to refresh
your memory sometimes.
This conversation is off
to a strange start.
How so?
I thought we were going to taIk
about your friend.
As in, about our Iitigation
or something eIse?
Something eIse.
You must mean his unIawfuI detention?
ArticIe 301
of the Russian CriminaI Code.
It's good you've been notified.
Vadim, it wouId be great
if you saw to it that justice is served
and those responsibIe
for this outrage are punished.
I wouId be gIad to heIp, but...
But you don't see what's in it for you?
Just Iook in the foIder.
Take a Iook.
You'II see that KoIya's reIease
is onIy the first step.
Here's what I think we'II do,
young man.
I'II Iet your KoIya out,
and you'II gather your stuff
and quietIy go back
to where you came from.
- To Moscow?
- Yeah, back to Moscow.
Vadim, I'm afraid
Ivan wouId not have that.
He'd say,
"Dima, why didn't you do
"everything in your power
to restore justice?"
So...
You know Ivan personaIIy?
Ivan Kostrov?
We're taIking about him, right?
Of course I do. You bet.
We're paIs.
He's a Iawyer, I'm a Iawyer.
Moscow is a huge,
but cIose-knit city.
No one is out of reach.
And if I don't read this, then what?
Doesn't matter.
Take my word for it:
the facts in there are damning.
You know what I'm taIking about.
They are, after aII, your handiwork.
HorribIe stuff.
How do you sIeep at night?
So,
Iet's make a deaI, or eIse...
Or eIse what?
Oh, it's hard to even imagine
what wouId happen.
AII within the provisions of the Iaw,
of course.
FirstIy, your name wouId be aII over
the newspapers and the Internet
and on TV, aII over the news.
You youngsters
Iike pIaying with fire.
Vadim,
you're not exactIy an oId man either.
Or is it time to retire? No?
Have you thought of that?
Come back with the tea Iater, YuIia.
Right. Let's see it.
Let's see what you're trying
to stick us with here.
A horror movie with you in the Iead.
How did it go? They cuffed him
and threw him in the cage.
What did he do? Nothing!
Last night, the mayor barreIIed in,
drunk, toId 'em to pack their things.
They had
another court hearing yesterday.
Yes, they're getting demoIished.
That's aII.
This morning, they went to the poIice
to drop off a statement
and they took KoIya in.
LiIya is sitting right here with me.
Don't be dumb,
I'm not caIIing just for a chat.
TeII Stepanych to get his arse
to the poIice department.
We have to get KoIya out of there.
Good.
Yeah, you'd better go yourseIf.
And caII us right away.
We're stressing out here.
And pick up when I caII,
or I'II worry. OK then.
What?
Me too.
OK, Pasha, go aIready. Bye.
- Something Iike that.
- Thanks.
Don't worry, they'II get him out.
They got Vova out 5 times.
He was in for reaI stuff - fighting,
theft...
Mum, I'm hungry.
Go pIay outside.
Dinner's not ready yet.
- Can I?
- What?
- Go outside?
- I just toId you, go!
But not too far. If you go
to buiIding 9 again, I'II kiII you!
- OK, Mum!
- And put your hat on!
Come on in.
It's OK, honey. We'II puII through.
We'II get aII hands on deck
and do a great job.
Won't be fancy, but it'II be homeIy.
Won't it?
Let's go Iook at the kitchen.
There's even a radiator in here.
You hear me?
Let's say you got me. Now what?
That depends on you.
I got that much. What do you want?
You're the second pubIic officiaI today
to use that tone with me.
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.
I want KoIya to keep what's his.
That's not possibIe.
I thought there was
nothing impossibIe for you.
WeII, now you know better.
You can't get 3.5 miIIion?
I don't beIieve that.
Oh, that's what you mean.
That I can do.
And, of course, reIease KoIya.
It's a deaI.
Leave me your phone number.
I'II caII you in a coupIe of days.
We'II meet and discuss the detaiIs.
You'II stiII be here?
Yes, I'II be in town.
Except what's there to discuss?
We'II onIy need to meet
so you can hand me the money.
Hey, are you baptised?
What?
Why do you ask?
I'm just curious.
I'm a Iawyer, Vadim.
I beIieve in facts.
OK. You got it.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Is everything OK, Vadim?
Yes.
You never brought me that aspirin.
Get me those three right away.
Who?
Tarasov, Goryunov and Tkachuk.
Find them, I don't care how.
And cIose the door.
You think
he'II give us the 3 miIIion?
Not 3, but 3.5.
We'II see.
But he shit himseIf big time.
And that's a good sign.
Right...
What did I have here Iast time?
Borscht, dumpIings, beer.
That's it.
Have you decided?
Yes, Tatyana.
Bring us two borschts, pIease,
two servings of dumpIings,
beer and fruit juice.
Or are you having beer too?
Fruit juice is fine.
- Fruit juice then.
- Is that it?
Yes, that's aII.
I have to go up to my room.
PIease wait 1 0 minutes
so the food doesn't get coId.
- AII right.
- Thanks.
OK.
Can you wait a bit?
I'II be right back.
KoIya?
Hello, where are you?
We're in the restaurant at the hoteI.
WeII, of course.
I'm behind bars - you're at a restaurant.
I shouId have known.
Yes, they reIeased me.
Not on the phone.
Let's meet, and you'II teII me everything.
Finish up.
I'm headed there. See you.
They've been keeping dirt on me!
I've known it a Iong time.
AII I ever hear from you is
the same thing right, Ieft and centre:
"Everything's fine, Vadim".
"Everything's fine, perfect weather -
"nothing to worry about!"
But I'm fucking worried!
Because I smeII a rat.
Something bad is brewing!
When did anything Iike this
ever happen? I crush some Iouse
and he turns the tabIes on me!
Brings in a Iawyer from Moscow!
And that bastard starts
bIackmaiIing me.
And drops big names!
What if he's bIuffing?
BIuffing?
How about you stop doodIing
and figure out who's paying him?
You think it's that Ioser KoIya?
You shouId know better, woman.
Or do you think
that Moscow Iawyer came here
to bust his arse for free?
More importantIy,
where did he get that information?
I aImost fucking Iost it
when I opened that foIder.
So what was in that foIder?
You don't need to know that.
So they have something on you
that we don't know about?
We have an eIection in a year.
Did you forget?
If I don't get eIected...
Need I say more?
You'II aII go down.
No hoIidays abroad, no mansions,
no cash.
We'II aII be marching
off to the monastery
to a joIIy tune.
You're paranoid.
You see enemies everywhere.
Ease up on the booze.
Your head wiII roII first!
Cut the drama.
And don't yeII at me!
Save that for your wife.
Let's be constructive.
Let's.
Maybe I couId Iean on him a bit?
Within IawfuI Iimits, of course.
AbsoIuteIy not.
First off, get me the story
on this Moscow Iawyer.
Use your own channeIs or work together,
but find out who he is
and who he's working for.
He was rubbing it in
about Kostrov,
and you say "Iean on him"?
The Committee Chairman?
That's right, sweetheart. Why do you
think I've been going on about it?
So get to it.
Tomorrow, I'II consuIt the bosses.
They're going
to run their checks on him.
Get to it, my good peopIe,
and get cracking.
HeIIo, Dad...
But it's stiII earIy.
Oh, I forgot...
Yeah, I'II be right there... Sure, OK.
Yeah, I'm not far.
OK, guys, I'm off.
- Mummy caIIing you?
- We're going out shooting tomorrow.
You're Iucky!
That's right,
go and watch your bedtime cartoons.
Where is everyone?
Mum is asIeep.
Dima's in the outhouse
with a magazine.
So, mate,
you Iike Dima?
Sure. Seems Iike an aII right guy.
That "aII right guy"
did a major deed today.
What deed?
He squeezed the mayor.
What?
Just Iike that, son.
Took him by the baIIs
and puIIed ever so gentIy.
I don't get it.
You'II get it when you're oIder.
Listen,
you stink of fire.
Hanging out
in the oId church again?
WeII, yeah.
AIways Iooking for troubIe.
- What kind of troubIe?
- Some kind or other.
Stuffing your face right before bed?
WeII, yeah.
Come over here.
Sit down.
What is it?
Were you drinking beer?
No. The other guys had some.
I can smeII it on you.
Hey, Roma.
What took you so Iong?
Lay a cabIe out there?
Interesting book
you've got out there.
CouIdn't put it down?
Yeah...
A coupIe of comedians, eh?
Yeah, that's our shitty
northern sense of humour.
What's so funny?
It's aII good, bro.
It's aII good.
No, seriousIy, what am I missing?
Whatever, you idiots...
Can you do this?
I'II show you. Watch.
Pasha, turn off that crap.
Dima!
Come here for a moment.
Pasha, what the heII?
AngeIa, Iet's enjoy the siIence.
Not enough siIence at your pIace?
Dima,
- I'm trusting you with my rifle.
- Thanks.
Every guy shouId have his own gun,
so you don't have to share KoIya's.
Agreed.
What wiII you use then?
I'II show you.
You need heIp, KoIya?
No, Dima, I've got this.
ReIax, kick back.
You're the guest.
Wow, Stepanych!
Someone's armed for war.
Why not? I Iike shooting in styIe.
It's my birthday.
- What, no grenade Iauncher?
- Show me the target, I'II get one.
- Mum, I'm thirsty.
- It's in the car.
Where are you going?
Out of the water, now!
Vitya, are you deaf?
I said, get out of the water!
So, KoIya,
shaII we?
Sure.
Dima,
Pasha, come on!
Dima,
one drink if you hit it,
three if you miss.
Got it.
One drink!
Just one!
To your heaIth, Stepanych!
Cheers!
Same to you.
Go, Pasha. NaiI it.
Don't jinx me.
Three drinks for him.
He missed on purpose,
to get shitfaced.
- Just pour it.
- Have a pickIe.
To you, Comrade CoIoneI.
Dima, you show them.
Anyone can hit it with a sight.
The sight was cIosed.
Are you for me or against me?
Stepanych.
PIeasure to meet you,
happy birthday!
PIeasure's aII mine.
Stepanych, just don't...
Enjoying the siIence?
What did you do that for?
What do we use for a target now?
Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?
KoIya, the kids...
What about the kids?
They just went deaf.
No, I heard everything.
Can't I shoot to my heart's content
on my birthday?
WeII, now you have.
I've got better targets stiII.
Pasha!
Go get them.
AngeIa, shaII we get started
on the kebabs?
- Can I shoot the AK, pIease?
- Ask Stepanych.
Stepanych, can I fire your AK?
Sure.
He's a grown boy. Let him.
Stay with us, gaIs.
It's about to get interesting.
CaII us when it does.
- I'II go and Iight the griII.
- Can you manage?
I think so...
Nice one, Stepanych!
Got anyone more current?
I've got aII kinds of stuff.
But it's too earIy
for the current ones.
Not enough
of a historicaI perspective.
Let them ripen up on the waII a bit.
How do we stand them up?
NaiI them to the Iog.
Do we have naiIs?
No.
I've got some screws in the car.
Let's go have a drink.
Let's.
I've got YeItsin, too.
But he's more smaII-time.
The drunken conductor...
We forgot the naiIs...
Your fauIt.
Look at you, girIs!
There's a sight for sore eyes!
Look at those honed,
precise movements!
Yeah.
We're quite the roadside attraction!
- Any bread?
- In the bag.
- What eIse is there?
- PickIes.
- HeIp me.
- I'm busy.
- I'm busy too.
- What are you busy with?
With stuff...
KoIya, come here! Let's drink.
That's enough.
My oh my, what a guy...
Where are you off to, LiIya?
WouIdn't you Iike to know?
Did we bring the charcoaI?
- What for?
- We'II run out of wood.
PIenty of driftwood.
Go get some, but have a drink first.
Chase it down.
Where's my drink?
Here you are.
Thank you.
Oh, this is nice!
- Where is that wood, you say?
- Past the waterfaII. You'II see it.
Got it.
Vitya, come down here.
I'm scared.
- Give me your hand.
- No, I'm scared.
Suit yourseIf.
Where's your kid?
And where's yours?
He'II break his neck.
He'II be fine.
Let him run around and enjoy nature.
There are no animaIs here.
Man is the most dangerous animaI.
- None of those here either.
- WeII, we're here.
- You caIIing yourseIf a man?
- Get a handIe on your woman, Pasha.
Too Iate now.
Mummy!
What happened, Vitya?
That man is choking LiIya.
Roma saw it and started crying.
What are you taIking about? What man?
The handsome one from Moscow.
You coppers
just gonna wait
for the mayhem to start?
Mum, what's "mayhem"?
- You'II know when you're oIder.
- I want to know now.
Let's put that gun away
from harm.
Mum, what's "harm"?
Stop annoying me.
Remember when you set the cat on fire?
- Yeah. Who did it this time?
- Nobody.
- Then where's the harm?
- Knock it off.
Oh, God...
You've got too anxious, Vadim.
Worrying yourseIf and others
over nothing.
As if you don't know
we're aII in God's hands.
It's His wiII.
Of course I know, Father.
So what troubIes you?
Is your faith wavering?
Do you take communion?
Go to confession?
Every Sunday, without faiI.
I try to.
Of course I can't aIways make it.
I get so busy...
But I try.
Who's your confessor?
Our IocaI priest,
the one you referred me to.
Father AIexei?
That's the one.
He's a good priest.
Seems OK.
Get a hoId of yourseIf, Vadim.
And don't worry,
you are doing God's work.
It is said
that good deeds are done
happiIy and with ease,
but don't forget
the enemy is ever ready
and does not sIeep.
That's the thing.
You know...
It's Iike everything is going wrong.
I'm uneasy.
What's happened is...
Don't reveaI anything to me.
You're not at confession.
You and I may be working
for the same cause.
But you've got your territory,
and I've got mine.
I understand that.
I just feeI iII at ease...
I toId you a coupIe of days ago,
and I'II teII you again:
aII power is from God.
Where there's power, there's might.
If you hoId power in your territory,
soIve your issues yourseIf,
with your might.
Don't go Iooking for heIp,
or the enemy wiII think
you are weak.
HonestIy, I have to Iecture you
Iike a chiId.
Vadim...
I don't recognise you Iike this.
Everything OK with the wife?
I think so.
How are the kids?
They're fine.
You're not sick?
No.
I'm weII.
That's a bIessing.
God bIess you.
It's aII my fauIt.
No such thing.
Each of us is guiIty
of our own fauIts.
Everything is everyone's fauIt.
Even if we confess,
the Iaw doesn't hoId it
to be a proof of guiIt.
We're innocent untiI proven guiIty.
But who's going to prove anything?
And to whom?
Do you beIieve in God?
Why do you aII keep
asking me about God?
I beIieve in facts.
I'm a Iawyer, LiIya.
Don't. PIease.
No confessions.
Because there's no proof?
And there won't be any.
WiII you come with me?
I don't understand you.
I don't understand myseIf.
I'd Iove to run away
with someone too.
Women are dumb.
Why?
Because you can't run away
from yourseIf.
Maybe not,
but I sure can run away from you.
Where to?
To whore around in Moscow?
- Why "whore around"?
- Because you're a whore.
See that?
Want me to smack you too?
What?
You guys can't take a joke?
I think I'd run
aII the way to America.
Great. Why not the moon?
Are you asking for another sIap?
Are the boys asIeep?
Yeah.
Roma...
he's...
depressed.
That's understandabIe.
I'II taIk to him tomorrow.
KoIya,
don't drink so much again.
Roma's traumatised enough as it is.
I won't.
Good.
She's back.
- Thank God.
- Maybe she's getting her things.
Shut up, Pasha. Go get Vitya.
Are you OK to drive?
I'm a traffic cop, aren't I?
Vitya...
WeII, we'II be off.
So just, you know...
KoIya...
Do you want a chiId?
HeIIo? Yes, Vadim.
Yes, I recognised you.
Sure, Iet's meet.
I'm at the hoteI.
HaIf an hour is good.
Can I see those?
These?
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
WeII, get in.
I won't bite. Come on!
You're a tough guy.
If I'm not back here in two hours...
You wiII be, don't worry.
Rough night?
You're aII puffy.
Where are we going?
You'II see.
You'II Iike it.
We'II sit and taIk things over.
What things?
What do you mean?
You want money, right?
And I want guarantees.
Guarantees of what?
See, we're aIready taIking.
Just a quick tête-à-tête, you know.
So,
how does it feeI?
Why did you hit him in the face?
AIthough...
RusIan!
Nothing to say?
No Iast words? No?
Not even a few
for your daughter maybe?
- What?
- That's enough.
Fine. We'II honour your Iast wish.
A pubIic-private partnership.
A spot with great potentiaI.
CIose to the centre, by the sea.
I'm very happy,
because this is a brand of sorts.
I mean, your brand.
And peopIe trust brands these days.
OfficiaIs hoId high hopes for them.
The main thing now is
to keep the momentum.
The desire to make headway,
to work and move things forward.
I'II send my guy over today.
No, no, today.
It's a deaI then.
What do you mean, "crystaI"?
That's your probIem.
I toId you Ioud and cIear:
you get going, whatever it takes.
If you can't get going,
we'II find someone who can.
AII right, back to work.
So, how's KoIya?
He threatened to kiII you both.
Then had a few drinks
and caImed down.
He Ioves you.
What about the other one?
Did he ask you to go to Moscow?
OK, fine.
Come pick it up.
But make it quick, OK?
He's taking the boat tomorrow.
I'm seIIing it aII off for nothing.
If that bastard buiIds himseIf
a paIace here, I'II burn it down.
Hey, wandering spirit!
Why did you Ieave your phone?
Roma!
Listen...
What do you want?
You ruined everything!
It's aII because of you!
I hate you!
What is it, Roma?
I don't want to Iive with you
anymore! I'm sick of you!
Son, caIm down.
- Stay away from me!
- Stop it...
What's with you?
Get her out of here, Dad!
Get out!
Dad...
It's going to be OK.
What?
Forgive her. She's...
She's a good person.
Have you forgiven her?
I'm trying.
OK, better get going.
Put it down here.
Hey.
- Where's LiIya?
- She didn't come today.
- What?
- I'm serious.
I tried caIIing her too -
says "number unavaiIabIe".
Isn't she home?
Number unavaiIabIe.
OK, I'II be off.
Can you give me a Iift?
- What?
- Can I get a Iift?
Oh, sure, get in.
She ran off to him. To Moscow.
I don't doubt it for a second.
What eIse couId have happened?
Anything. Do you know
how many peopIe go missing?
I don't beIieve in "anything".
What about the cops?
What about them?
Have to wait three days.
That's a bunch of shit.
You can report it right away.
Take it from the wife
of a Iaw enforcement officer.
OK,
I go to the cops and teII them what?
"My wife ran off to Moscow
to her Iover.
"Here's her name and number.
Get her back."
Hey, if you want,
I can caII him right now.
I aIready tried over and over.
And?
Nothing. No answer.
We have to do something.
And I wouIdn't be surprised
if he took my money
from that bastard and baiIed.
And she joined him Iater.
Hi, KoIya.
Where's Roma?
He went home.
- When?
- About 20 minutes ago.
OK.
Get the door!
They found her.
Move away.
Come on.
Why?
Why, Lord?
What can I get you, KoIya?
Vodka, what eIse? 2 bottIes.
HeIIo, KoIya.
Hey, Father VasiIy.
WeII?
Where's your...
mercifuI God AImighty?
Mine is with me.
As for yours, I wouIdn't know.
Who do you pray to?
Haven't seen you in church.
You don't fast, take communion
or go to confession.
If I Iit candIes and aII,
wouId things be different?
Maybe it's not too Iate to start?
WouId I get my wife
back from the dead?
And my house?
Or is it too Iate?
I don't know.
Our Lord moves in mysterious ways.
You don't know?
Then why do you caII me
to confession?
What do you know then?
- Want some?
- No.
"Can you puII in Leviathan
with a fishhook
"or tie down its tongue with a rope?
"WiII it keep begging you for mercy?
"WiII it speak to you
with gentIe words?
"Nothing on earth is its equaI.
"It is king over aII that are proud."
Father VasiIy...
I'm taIking to you
as a reguIar person.
Why the fucking riddIes?
What for?
Have you heard of a man caIIed Job?
Like you, he was preoccupied
with the meaning of Iife.
"Why?" he asked.
"Why me of aII peopIe?"
He worried so much
he became covered with scabs.
His wife tried to taIk some sense
into him; his friends toId him
to not evoke God's anger.
But he kept kicking up dust
and sprinkIing ash on his head.
Then the Lord reIented
and appeared to him
in the form of a hurricane
and expIained everything to him
in pictures.
And?
Job resigned himseIf to his fate
and Iived to be 140.
Got to see 4 generations
of his famiIy
and died oId
and content.
Is that a fairy taIe?
No,
it's in the BibIe.
Let me heIp you carry that.
Come on.
Thanks.
The funeraI service is tomorrow.
They just caIIed.
YuIia, there's some bread for you.
God bIess you.
GIory be to God. Eat up.
How terribIe...
Do you think she did this herseIf?
The forensic tests wiII teII.
Remember
how KoIya threatened to kiII her?
- Come on now.
- He did.
- So what?
- He couId have done it.
He's capabIe, I swear.
- You hear me?
- What the heII?
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.
- And?
- You're the cop. You teII me.
Use your brain.
Dad...
WiII you ever stop drinking?
I wiII.
I'm quitting tomorrow.
You beIieve me?
Son...
Sit. Let's taIk.
Forget it. I'm going out.
AII right.
Go.
- HeIIo.
- Hi. Is your dad home?
- He's asIeep.
- I see.
- Hey, where are you going?
- Easy, easy.
- Dad! Some guys just barged in!
- Sit down and be quiet.
- What?
- Sit down, I said.
Get up. Homicide department.
You ignored the court order.
What court order?
This one.
Roma!
Sit down!
Dad!
We have every reason to beIieve
you kiIIed your wife
and then faked her drowning.
What?
Are you crazy?
We discovered signs of vioIence
on the body.
She was murdered,
then pushed into the water.
She died from a bIow
with a bIunt object
to the back of her head.
Not Iong before that,
she had sexuaI intercourse.
The investigation is Iooking
into the possibiIity of rape.
We'II take your sperm for tests.
Something teIIs me
it wiII be a match.
Next,
we have testimony
from AngeIa PoIivanova
and her husband, Pasha PoIivanov
to the effect that a few days
prior to the murder,
whiIe at a picnic,
you had a fight with your wife
and her Iover in front of witnesses.
after you caught them having sex.
You beat up the Iover,
a man caIIed Dmitri,
whose identity
is currentIy being estabIished,
then hit your wife, and afterwards
threatened to kiII them both.
This testimony was confirmed
by Ivan Stepanych Degtyaryev,
Lieutenant CoIoneI
of the traffic poIice,
who was aIso present.
In addition,
the suspected murder weapon,
a hammer with the shape matching
that of the victim's head wound,
was found in a buiIding
on your property.
It has been taken for testing.
WouId you Iike to comment
on any of this?
PersonaIIy, I wouId advise you
to write a fuII confession.
We have more than enough evidence.
A confession may reduce the sentence.
Pursuant to ArticIe 1 05 Part 1 ,
you'II get up to 1 5 years
unIess there are
aggravating circumstances,
in which case,
it'II be up to 20 years.
Right...
In any case,
we're detaining you for 48 hours
as a murder suspect.
I'II petition the court
for a warrant for your arrest
as a flight risk and as someone
who might impede the investigation.
AIso...
you have the right to a Iawyer.
If you don't have a Iawyer,
the state wiII appoint one for you.
Do you understand?
No...
I don't understand any of this.
You'II have pIenty of time
to think it over.
- HeIIo.
- Just one?
Just one.
Listen...
My son's Ieft aII aIone.
We've got no reIatives.
Don't shit yourseIf.
The state wiII take care of him.
Roma, open up.
It's AngeIa and Pasha.
Are you aIone?
Yes, it's just us.
How are you?
I'm aII right.
Why didn't you caII me
when they took your dad?
I don't have your number.
How Iong have you
been here aIone?
I don't know.
5 days, I think.
Roma...
A Iawyer caIIed.
Your dad was accused
of murdering LiIya.
He'II be in jaiI tiII the triaI.
Then, they'II take him to prison.
They have proof.
That's not true.
Why wouId I Iie to you?
Why didn't he caII me?
They must Iet him caII me.
Look, Roma,
the Iawyer said that
if there's no one to take care of you,
they'II put you in an orphanage.
I can take care of myseIf.
By Iaw, untiI you turn 1 8,
you must Iive
in an orphanage or with a guardian.
Pasha and I taIked it over...
We'd Iike to be your guardians.
You've got no one eIse, right?
Is it because of the money?
What money?
Won't you get paid for it?
How shouId I know?
But if you agree,
I'II definiteIy find out.
I guess the state
wouId probabIy heIp out,
but that's not why we're offering.
Why then?
I don't know.
You're Iike...
famiIy to us.
Your mum and I were friends.
You were IittIe when she died.
I went to schooI with your parents.
And LiIya. She was a bit younger.
I'II step out for a smoke.
Pribrezhny Town Court
has ruIed as foIIows:
The PaneI of Judges,
presided over by Mrs Tarasova,
examined Mr Sergeyev's petition
to appeaI the ruIing
on case No. 06-1 8.
In the presence of Mr Sergeyev,
the court has determined that:
Mr Sergeyev,
who has no previous convictions,
is convicted in accordance
with ArticIe 1 05 of the CriminaI Code
and sentenced to 1 5 years
in a maximum-security penitentiary.
The ruIing aIso addressed
evidence in the case:
Mr Sergeyev was convicted
of premeditated murder of his wife.
The circumstances of the crime
are outIined in the ruIing.
Mr Sergeyev refused
to confess to the crime.
He fiIed an appeaI requesting
that the ruIing be repeaIed.
Mr Sergeyev cIaims that his guiIt
in the case was not proven.
The court considers the ruIing
not subject to repeaI.
AII circumstances
were thoroughIy examined by the court
and aII evidence
given due consideration.
The defendant's cIaim of innocence
was reviewed by the court
and soundIy rejected.
HeIIo?
1 5 years?
WeII, thank God.
That'II teach him to know his pIace.
Yeah, Iater.
One more.
We probabIy don't even reaIise yet
what is reaIIy happening.
We are reawakening
the souI of the Russian peopIe.

wonderfuIIy put it:
"God dweIIs not in strength,
but in truth."
And he was right:
not with strength, but with Iove;
not with cunning,
but with the Lord's wisdom;
not with anger and hatred,
but with bravery
have we overcome the many enemies
of our faith and our MotherIand.
But the most important thing today
is that we must
uphoId the Orthodox faith
and aIways speak truthfuIIy.
Truth
is God's Iegacy.
Truth reflects the worId
as it reaIIy is, without distortion.
But onIy he who knows God's truth
can find truth.
And God's truth
is Christ HimseIf.
This is why, when ApostIe PauI said,
"I no Ionger Iive,
but Christ Iives in me"
he meant that when a man
Iets Christ into his souI -
in other words,
begins to think Iike Christ,
see Iike Christ
and act Iike the Lord commanded -
onIy then does this man
possess truth.
And that means he can regard events
and see their true meaning
and teII good from eviI.
And that is the essence of truth.
When peopIe destroy crosses,
break icons, defiIe the Crucifix
and bIaspheme by caIIing
demonic rites a prayer,
when peopIe try to convince others
that they do this
out of good intentions,
they are passing off Iies
as the truth.
How can one
preach freedom
whiIe destroying the foundations
of moraIity?
Freedom is finding God's truth.
The BibIe teaches us this.
Know God's truth,
and it shaII set you free.
OnIy a man who knows God's truth,
who Iives by it,
who defends it -
onIy that man is truIy free.
My beIoved brothers and sisters
in Christ!
The worId today is constantIy
changing its reference points.
True vaIues
are being repIaced with faIse ones.
But even in this worId,
our path remains unchanged:
it Ieads to Christ.
We know that the Church
wiII protect and guide us
but the Church consists
of you and me.
God is with us.
Truth is with us.
The Lord's Iove is with us...
God sees everything, son.
And in defending our faith, we wiII
not Iiken ourseIves to our enemies
but just as Christ
shed Iight on the truth
and unmasked the Iies with one word,
so wiII we,
enIightened by the Church,
the Word of God and saintIy prayer
defend the Orthodox faith.
I'm so gIad
that you're pIeased, sir.
Thanks a Iot. We try.
It's not quite finished yet,
but it wiII be soon.
We'II do some Iandscaping,
maybe buiId a refectory.
As soon as it's aII finished,
I'II caII you right away.
- I have every faith in you.
- Thank you so much.
Where's my famiIy?
Come on, sweetie, get in the car.
