<i>WE ALL GO </i>
<i>A LITTLE CRAZY</i>
<i>WHEN WE FALL IN LOVE.</i>
<i> IT'S NOTHING NEW.</i>
<i> TAKE THIS HUNTER.</i>
<i> HE FINDS A SHINY</i>
<i> ROCK AND FIGURES</i>
<i> HE'LL GIVE IT TO</i>
<i> HIS GIRLFRIEND.</i>
<i> THE NEXT DAY HE'S</i>
<i> LEAVING FOR A LION HUNT,</i>
<i> AND IN HIS EXCITEMENT, HE</i>
<i> DROPS THE ROCK ON HIS WAY OUT.</i>
<i> THE GIRLFRIEND FINDS IT</i>
<i> AND SHE'S ALL LIKE,</i>
<i> "WHO IS THIS FOR?</i>
<i> ZOG DOESN'T LIKE SHINY ROCKS.</i>
<i> "WAIT. THAT GIRL UBA</i>
<i> LIKES SHINY ROCKS,</i>
<i> "AND ZOG WAS TOTALLY ASKING</i>
<i> ABOUT HER THE OTHER DAY</i>
<i> "WHEN WE WERE</i>
<i> SKINNING THAT GOAT.</i>
<i> "UBA. I CAN'T</i>
<i> BELIEVE IT!</i>
<i> THAT STUPID WHORE,"</i>
<i> BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.</i>
<i> YOU SEE WHERE</i>
<i> IT GOES FROM THERE.</i>
<i> IT'S NO</i>
<i> DIFFERENT TODAY.</i>
<i> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO</i>
<i> YOU ARE, NOBODY'S SAFE.</i>
<i> YOU GET A TEXT MESSAGE FROM</i>
<i> A SIGNIFICANT OTHER WITH</i>
<i> ONE EXCLAMATION POINT</i>
<i> WHEN YOU EXPECTED</i>
<i> THREE EXCLAMATION POINTS,</i>
<i> AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW</i>
<i> YOU'RE RIGHT</i>
<i> OFF THE CLIFF,</i>
<i> DESCENDING FAST</i>
<i> INTO CRAZY VALLEY.</i>
<i> BUT THEN AFTER</i>
<i> THE MISUNDERSTANDING</i>
<i> IS CLEARED UP,</i>
<i> YOU BOUNCE BACK.</i>
<i> YOU REALIZE YOU WERE</i>
<i> JUST ACTING SILLY,</i>
<i> AND YOU GET BACK</i>
<i> TO BEING IN LOVE.</i>
<i> BUT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE</i>
<i> WHO ARE DIFFERENT.</i>
<i> THE TRULY LOVESICK</i>
<i> GET IT MUCH WORSE.</i>
                  NO!
<i> FOR EVIDENCE I SUBMIT</i>
<i> MY BEST FRIEND, CHARLIE DARBY.</i>
<i> HERE HE IS</i>
<i> A FEW MONTHS AGO,</i>
<i> BEFORE HE WAS</i>
<i> DIAGNOSED A PSYCHOTIC.</i>
<i> BACK THEN HE JUST THOUGHT</i>
<i> HE WAS UNLUCKY WITH WOMEN,</i>
<i> AND STUPID ME,</i>
<i> I BELIEVED HIM.</i>
<i> LOOKING BACK ON IT, I GUESS IT</i>
<i> DOES SEEM A LITTLE FARFETCHED</i>
<i> THAT HANNAH CARTWRIGHT,</i>
<i> HIS EIGHTH-GRADE GIRLFRIEND</i>
<i> GAVE HIM THIS, AND THEN</i>
<i> LEFT HIM THE NEXT DAY</i>
<i> FOR THE KID FROM</i>
<i> "HAPPY DAYS."</i>
<i> THERE WAS MICHELLE</i>
<i><i><i> FROM GRAD SCHOOL:</i>
<i> "THE ONLY THING I LOVE</i>
<i> MORE THAN COFFEE IS YOU."</i>
<i> ACCORDING TO CHARLIE,</i>
<i> SHE FORGOT TO MENTION</i>
<i> HALF THE ENGLISH FACULTY</i>
<i> AT SAN FRANCISCO STATE.</i>
<i> WHICH BRINGS US TO JACINDA.</i>
<i> TURNED OUT NOT ONLY</i>
<i> WAS SHE MARRIED,</i>
<i> BUT HER HUSBAND WAS</i>
<i> IN PRISON IN SYDNEY.</i>
<i> BAS ANDERSON.</i>
<i> STRING OF ARMED ROBBERIES.</i>
<i> OKAY, I'M SURE</i>
<i> I SEEM LIKE A MORON</i>
<i> FOR NOT PICKING UP ON ANY OF</i>
<i> HIS LUNACY A LITTLE SOONER.</i>
<i> AT THE TIME, I REALLY</i>
<i> DID JUST BELIEVE HIM.</i>
<i> WHY WOULDN'T I?</i>
<i> HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.</i>
<i> HE'S THE PRINCIPAL</i>
<i> OF MY SCHOOL.</i>
<i> HE'S THE GODFATHER</i>
<i> TO MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.</i>
<i> BUT IF THERE'S</i>
<i> ONE THING I'VE LEARNED,</i>
<i> IT'S THAT ALL THOSE THINGS</i>
<i> CAN BE TRUE ABOUT A GUY</i>
<i> AND HE CAN STILL BE</i>
<i> COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY</i>
<i> OUT OF HIS MIND.</i>
YOU GOT ANY IDEA WHAT
THIS STUFF IS WORTH?
    YOU CAN'T PUT A VALUE ON IT.
    MY HEART IS IN THIS BOX.
SO, WHAT...
LIKE AROUND $40?
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR DONATION.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
     THANK YOU, UNCLE CHARLIE.
     I LOVE IT.
       ISN'T THAT IRONIC?
    I USED TO LOVE THE PERSON
    WHO GAVE THAT TO ME.
         WHAT'S A MATE?
      A MATE IS SOMEONE
      WHO SAYS THEY LOVE YOU,
      BUT THEY REALLY HAVE
      A BOYFRIEND IN PRISON.
HONEY, WHY DON'T YOU GO PUT THAT
WITH YOUR OTHER STUFFED ANIMALS?
           I'M TRYING
           TO HELP HER.
    CHARLIE, THAT'S A LITTLE
    HEAVY FOR A FIVE-YEAR-OLD.
      IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY
      TO START LEARNING ABOUT
        THE DANGERS OF LOVE.
         SO, IF JACINDA'S
         BOYFRIEND MAKES PAROLE,
         I MAY NEED TO LIVE WITH
         YOU GUYS FOR A WHILE.
 FROM NOW ON, WHY DON'T YOU LET
 US PICK OUT THE WOMEN YOU DATE?
        IT'D BE IMPOSSIBLE
        TO DO ANY WORSE.
          THANKS FOR THE OFFER,
          BUT I AM RETIRING FROM
          THAT ASPECT OF MY LIFE
          EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.
      I GOT RID OF EVERY
      REMEMBRANCE OF EVERY WOMAN
   WHO EVER BROKE MY HEART,
   AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY DONE.
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU HAD A DATE
MEETING US AT THE WEDDING.
            WELL, I DIDN'T SAY
            I'M NOT GONNA DATE.
         I'M JUST NOT GONNA
         LET MYSELF FALL IN LOVE
            IN THE NEAR FUTURE,
          OR THE DISTANT FUTURE.
          THE FUTURE.
       HOW DO YOU DATE
       AND NOT FALL IN LOVE?
              YOU JUST DATE
              THE KIND OF PEOPLE
              YOU CAN NEVER
              FALL IN LOVE WITH.
HEY. HEY, BIN LADEN.
BRING ME SOME MORE GRAPE.
        I DON'T APPRECIATE THAT.
YEAH?
         AND I DON'T APPRECIATE
         YOU PEOPLE HIDING BOMBS
             IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.
          I THINK THAT TROUT HAD
          A LOAD IN ITS BELLY.
                I'M GONNA
                INDUCE VOMITING.
       I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU
       WON'T CALL MY FRIEND SUE.
IS IT BECAUSE
SHE HAS CLASS?
      I TOLD YOU,
      I AM NOT INTERESTED.
      THIS IS EXACTLY
      WHY I BROUGHT A DATE,
     SO I WOULDN'T HAVE PEOPLE
     FIXING ME UP ALL NIGHT.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
ACCOMPLISH THAT.
ALL YOU DID WAS PUT
THE BUSBOYS IN DANGER.
        AND THE BRIDESMAIDS.
        I THINK ONE LOST A TOOTH
DURING THE
BOUQUET THING.
    SHE REALLY WANTED IT.
    SHE'S LOOKING FOR LOVE.
MAYBE SHE SHOULD
TRY THE ZOO.
          OKAY, LOOK.
          ENOUGH.
      OBVIOUSLY I DIDN'T
      KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT HER.
               I MET HER ONLINE.
            PARANOID-RACIST.COM?
       WILL YOU LAY OFF,
       ROBERTA? HUH?
      COME ON. SHE MARCHES
      TO HER OWN BEAT.
           PARDON ME.
    YEAH, FUCK THIS CLAMBAKE.
   I DON'T NEED YOU.
   I ALREADY GOT A COCK.
TODAY'S
ANNOUNCEMENTS HAVE BEEN
COMING TO YOU
FROM ROTTERDAM.
SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY WHEN
THE GOOD SHIP<i> LINCOLN ELEMENTARY</i>
  LANDS IN THE BIGGEST PORT
  IN SOUTH AMERICA!
  IN THE MEANTIME,
  GREETINGS FROM ROTTERDAM.
                COME ON,
                YOU CAN DO THIS.
      SO, WHAT ARE YOU
      DOING TONIGHT?
      DO YOU WANT TO, UH,
      WANT TO GRAB A BEER?
            CAN'T DO IT. GOT ME
            A LITTLE DATE NIGHT.
SO, JUST THE TWO OF YOU?
                           YEAH.
EXCUSE ME.
  AHOY.
MOLLY KINGSTON? I MET YOU
AT THE HOTEL YESTERDAY?
                RIGHT.
                "LOVE SHACK."
<i>SO THIS PROBABLY</i>
<i> REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION.</i>
    HEY, UM, YOU DON'T
  HAPPEN TO KNOW THE WORDS
  TO "LOVE SHACK," DO YOU?
               ACTUALLY,
               I DO.
<i>SORRY. STILL CONFUSING.</i>
<i>LET'S GO BACK A </i>
<i>LITTLE FURTHER.</i>
<i> OKAY...</i>
<i> GREAT.</i>
<i> SO, AFTER CHARLIE</i>
<i> DROPPED OFF ROBERTA,</i>
<i> HE HEADED BACK</i>
<i> INTO THE ELKS LODGE</i>
<i> PAST THE WEDDING RECEPTION,</i>
<i> PAST A RETIREMENT PARTY,</i>
<i> PAST A BAR MITZVAH,</i>
<i> AND STRAIGHT TO THE BAR</i>
<i> WHERE HE PROMPTLY MET</i>
<i> MOLLY KINGSTON.</i>
  CAN I GET A BIG
  GLASS OF WHISKEY?
<i> LEAD SINGER OF</i>
<i> TOTALLY AWESOME,</i>
<i> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S</i>
<i> TENTH BEST '80s COVER BAND.</i>
<i> TURNS OUT IT WAS NOT</i>
<i> HER FINEST HOUR EITHER,</i>
<i> AND SHE</i>
<i> LET HIM KNOW IT.</i>
  THAT BAR MITZVAH BOY
  TOLD ME I SUCKED.
  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
  HE SUCKS, OKAY?
I DON'T CARE IF HE BECAME
A MAN TODAY, HE SUCKS.
          IF YOU HATE
          YOUR JOB SO MUCH,
          MAYBE YOU SHOULD
          DO SOMETHING ELSE.
 I JUST HAVE TO MAKE
 IT THROUGH TODAY.
AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO
SOMETHING WITH MORE DIGNITY,
    LIKE STRIP.
          WE'RE BACK
          IN TWO MINUTES.
   I GOTTA RUN.
   MOLLY KINGSTON.
             CHARLIE DARBY.
ARE YOU THE CHARLIE DARBY
WHO'S THE PRINCIPAL AT LINCOLN?
        I AM, YEAH.
        DO WE HAVE ONE OF YOURS?
     MY NEPHEW,
     TIMMY CLARK.
             AH. I LOVE TIMMY.
             HE'S A GREAT KID.
  HE WORSHIPS YOU.
  HEY, UM, YOU DON'T
 HAPPEN TO KNOW THE WORDS
 TO "LOVE SHACK," DO YOU?
               ACTUALLY,
               I DO.
                 UH...
<i>SO WITH THAT</i>
<i> LITTLE CONNECTION,</i>
<i> THAT BRINGS</i>
<i> US BACK TO...</i>
RIGHT. "LOVE SHACK."
SO, I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AND I'M LOOKING FOR A JOB.
                     AH.
I HOPE THIS ISN'T
TOO FORWARD, BUT,
I-I WAS WONDERING IF
I CAN GIVE YOU MY RESUME?
               SURE. NO PROBLEM.
                DID YOU JUST GET
                YOUR CREDENTIAL?
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HAVE MY CREDENTIAL YET,
BUT I HAVE MY-MY
SUBSTITUTE CERTIFICATION.
    OH, WELL, THE SUBS ARE HIRED
    AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL.
 WE HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT
 AT THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS.
          BUT, WE ARE HAPPY
          TO PASS IT ON FOR YOU.
THANK YOU.
SO, UH, I GUESS
I'D BETTER RUN.
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU,
CAPTAIN.
     WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
     SHE'S GIVING YOU HER RESUME
               BECAUSE SHE WANTS
               YOU TO CALL HER.
I TOLD YOU, I HAVE NO
INTEREST IN A WOMAN THAT I...
       MIGHT ACTUALLY
       BE INTERESTED IN.
                 WOULD YOU
                 THINK ABOUT IT?
   WELL EDUCATED.
   DIVERSE INTERESTS.
  NANCY REAGAN AWARD
  FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE.
    SHE SOUNDS AWFUL.
        HEY, GOOD LUCK.
 SEE YOU
 TOMORROW.
           ALL RIGHT.
INDISTINCT)
  THE KEY IS JUST
  FOR EMERGENCIES.
  WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS
  BREAKING AND ENTERING.
WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?
EVERY TIME I KNOCK,
YOU DON'T ANSWER.
HAVE YOU SEEN
"WHEN HARRY ATE SALLY"?
              SOMEHOW
              I MISSED THAT ONE.
WELL, LET'S WATCH IT THEN.
IT ANSWERS
THE AGE-OLD QUESTION,
CAN TWO FRIENDS
GO DOWN ON EACH OTHER
AND STILL BE FRIENDS
IN THE MORNING?
           WHY DON'T YOU
           GO HOME AND WATCH IT,
        AND TELL ME WHAT
        CONCLUSION THEY COME TO?
I ENJOY WATCHING PORN
MORE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.
           AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO
           ASK FOR THE KEY BACK.
THAT KEY IS THE CONDUIT TO
MY GREATEST HUMAN CONNECTION.
               I'M YOUR GREATEST
               HUMAN CONNECTION?
                DO YOU EVEN KNOW
                MY LAST NAME?
I DON'T SEE HOW
THAT'S RELEVANT.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET IT.
WE'RE BOTH HOME,
THE TUBE'S ON,
WE'RE EATING CEREAL.
WHAT'S THE HARM IN US
DOING IT TOGETHER?
                 HELLO.
HI.
     YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE PALE.
           OH, THAT'S OKAY.
           I'M BETTER NOW.
         SO, WHERE ARE WE
         GOING TO DINNER?
  I DON'T KNOW.
  YOU MADE THE PLANS.
             OH, RIGHT.
               UH...
      LET'S START WALKING.
      MAYBE IT'LL COME TO ME.
OKAY, SO, IF YOU SUB
AT MY SCHOOL,
YOU CAN'T WEAR THAT DRESS.
THERE'S NO WAY
THE KIDS COULD CONCENTRATE,
AND OUR TEST SCORES
ARE LOW ENOUGH AS IT IS.
            THAT'S WHAT ALL THIS
            IS ABOUT, YOU KNOW.
         I'M JUST SCHMOOZING YOU
         TO GET SUBBING GIGS.
WELL, IT'S WORKING.
TOMORROW MORNING I'M FIRING
THE FIRST TEACHER I SEE.
ACTUALLY,
           ALL THESE SIDE JOBS
          ARE JUST WAYS SO I CAN
          MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY.
            I WANT TO OPEN
            MY OWN DANCE SCHOOL.
WOW. THAT'S FANTASTIC.
AND YOU DO HAVE
THE PERFECT BACKGROUND.
DANCED ALL OVER THE WORLD,
TRAINED IN BALLET,
JAZZ, TAP, HIP-HOP.
I STUDIED YOUR RESUME.
TO BE HONEST,
IT CONFUSED ME A LITTLE.
YOU WERE DANCING
IN VIENNA LAST YEAR,
  AND NOW YOU'RE
  IN SAN PEDRO?
              WELL, UM,
              I CAME BACK HOME
           TO BE NEAR MY FAMILY,
           AND I REALIZED
            THAT I REALLY
            ENJOY TEACHING.
NOTHING WRONG WITH TEACHING.
             I WILL MISS
             TRAVELING THOUGH.
NO DOUBT. GEEZ. IS THERE
ANY PLACE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN?
 THAILAND. THAT IS THE ONE PLACE
 I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO.
       ME TOO.
    REALLY? YOU'VE ALWAYS
    WANTED TO GO TO THAILAND?
 WELL, NOT ALWAYS.
 IT STARTED ABOUT
THREE SECONDS AGO WHEN
YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO GO,
AND I IMAGINED
GOING THERE WITH YOU.
           SHE'S AMAZING.
           SHE LOVES KIDS.
             SHE'S SMART,
             SEXY, FUNNY,
       KIND, CREATIVE, PUNCTUAL,
       AN EARLY RISER,
           LIKES TEA,
           A CHRISTMAS BABY.
  OKAY, I GET IT, MAN!
   I KNEW YOUR LUCK
   WOULD TURN AROUND.
THE LAW OF AVERAGES
AND WHATNOT.
               INCOMING.
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?
WE WERE
PLAYING KICKBALL.
HE WAS THE PITCHER
AND I WAS THE KICKER...
        I KICKED THE BALL,
        IT BOUNCED OFF A ROCK...
...AND ON ACCIDENT
IT HIT HIS FACE...
      ...AND WHILE HE DID IT,
      WHEN NO ONE WAS LOOKING...
...HE THREW THE BALL
AT MY FACE.
    ...AS HE WAS WALKING TOWARDS
    ME I SAW A BUG ON HIM--
          ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
          ALL RIGHT.
          I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.
NOW LISTEN.
     ONCE AND FOR ALL,
     YOU GUYS NEED TO UNDERSTAND
 HOW MUCH BETTER IT WOULD BE
 IF THE TWO OF YOU WERE FRIENDS.
                  UH...
        YOU BOTH PLAY BASEBALL.
        AND NOT ONLY THAT,
         YOU COULD SHARE ALL
         OF EACH OTHER'S STUFF.
  MATT, HOW MANY SERIES 6 AND 7
  LEGO MINI FIGURES DO YOU HAVE?
             SEVENTEEN.
                   AND SHANE?
     NINE.
             SO IF YOU
             POOLED TOGETHER
        ALL THOSE MINI FIGURES,
        HOW MANY WOULD YOU HAVE?
                  SIX?
            OKAY, HERE'S
            ANOTHER BENEFIT OF
SHANE CAN
        HELP YOU WITH YOUR MATH.
YOU FORGOT TO
CARRY THE ONE.
        SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?
        NO MORE NIPPLE WHIPPLES?
                    OKAY.
NO MORE NIPP-WHIPS.
                ALL RIGHT.
       WOW. YOU ARE FABULOUS
       WITH THESE KIDS.
         OH, THANK YOU.
         IT'S A LABOR OF LOVE.
                SO, THIS IS
                A NICE SURPRISE.
YEAH. TIMMY, UM,
FORGOT HIS VOLCANO
AND MY SISTER'S
STUCK AT THE OFFICE,
SO SHE ASKED ME
TO BRING IT IN.
          HE'S A GREAT KID.
       IT'S TOO BAD YOU'RE
       DESTROYING HIS EDUCATION.
  I AM?
             BECAUSE HIS
             PRINCIPAL CANNOT
               RUN HIS SCHOOL.
    HE KEEPS WISHING ONE OF
    HIS TEACHERS WOULD GET SICK
            SO HE CAN CALL
            YOU IN TO SUB.
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THAT
WE COULD SEE EACH OTHER.
          PLANT DRUGS ON
          THE MUSIC TEACHER?
OR... YOU KNOW, WE COULD MAKE
A DATE FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.
           THAT WORKS TOO.
        CAN I TAKE YOU TO
        MY FAVORITE LITTLE SPOT?
YOU MAY.
     ATTENTION, STUDENTS
     OF LINCOLN ELEMENTARY.
     MEET ME IN THE CAFETERIA
     IN FIVE MINUTES.
        FREE ICE CREAM
        FOR EVERYONE!
    EXCEPT THE DIABETICS.
    YOU GUYS GET A HALF DAY.
                   AND DOWN.
                   AND...
THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE TAKING
ME TO YOUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT.
            I SAID
            MY FAVORITE SPOT,
            WHICH THIS IS.
IS THIS...
      OH, GOD. IS THIS
      SUPPOSED TO BE THAILAND?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
           I-I THINK...
     I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
     LIKE IT. HOW LONG DID IT...
I HAD TO TAKE
A HALF DAY OFF OF WORK,
BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T TAKEN A DAY OFF IN,
LIKE, NINE YEARS, SO...
           MUAY PING?
IT SAYS SHE HAS
AN EARLY FLIGHT TO VEGAS
TO VISIT HER SICK
GRANDMOTHER. SO WHAT?
   PEOPLE'S GRANDPARENTS TEND TO
   LIVE IN FLORIDA, NOT VEGAS.
UNLESS HER GRANDMOTHER
IS CELINE DION.
       YOU'RE ONLY SUSPICIOUS
       BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS
             THAT HAVE HAPPENED
             IN THE PAST.
               YOU GOT NOTHING
               TO WORRY ABOUT.
     LOOK, SHE EVEN SIGNED THE
     LETTER WITH A LITTLE HEART.
THAT'S NOT A HEART,
THAT'S A MUSHROOM.
- IT'S NOT A MUSHROOM.
- A BOXING GLOVE?
IT'S NOT A BOXING GLOVE.
                   A CHEF'S HAT?
      THAT'S PROBABLY HER
      OWN LITTLE SALUTATION.
    I BET SHE SIGNS ALL OF HER
    LETTERS "CHEF'S HAT, MOLLY."
 NO, NOT ALL
 OF HER LETTERS.
JUST THE ONES WHERE
SHE'S BLOWING SOMEONE OFF.
A BLOW-OFF LETTER WOULDN'T HAVE
A SMILEY FACE INSIDE OF THE "O."
  THE LIPS TURN DOWN AT THE END.
  THAT IS A FROWNY FACE.
CHARLIE, COME ON.
          LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
          WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE.
   I NEED SOME PEACE OF MIND.
   MAYBE I SHOULD JUST CALL HER.
IF YOU CALL HER IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE CHECKING UP ON HER.
 WHAT I SHOULD DO IS SEND
 THE GRANDMOTHER A FRUIT BASKET.
 OR MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T.
         IF I SEND GRANDMA
         A GET-WELL-SOON GIFT
         AND IF BY SOME MIRACLE
         MOLLY REALLY IS THERE,
            THEN SHE'LL CALL
            TO THANK ME.
   I GUESS IT COULDN'T
   HURT TO SEND
   TO SEND THE SUCK-UP
   FRUIT BASKET.
                        EXACTLY!
   WHAT'S BETTER? SHOULD I ORDER
   A LOT OF ONE KIND OF FRUIT,
          OR SOME KIND OF
          AN ASSORTMENT?
      A THOUSAND
      CANTALOUPES?
              CANTALOUPES?
           OR ITS SISTER MELON,
           THE CRENSHAW?
LOOK. I'M JOKING, OKAY?
SEND THE FRUIT BASKET,
SPEND $50 TOPS.
                      OKAY.
 DON'T OVERDO IT.
                    I WON'T,
                    I WON'T.
                  THANKS, JAY.
HELLO. TODAY I'M GOING TO TELL
YOU WHY MY THREE AMERICAN HEROES
  ARE ABRAHAM LINCOLN,
  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
     AND PRINCIPAL
     CHARLES WINSTON DARBY.
 AM I GONNA HAVE TO
 TAKE THIS AWAY FROM YOU?
     ACCORDING TO THE GOOD FOLKS
     AT THE SIN CITY FRUIT BARN,
         THE CANTALOUPES ARRIVED
         23 MINUTES AGO.
              SHH!
                  STICK IT, AMY.
  HEY. STOP OBSESSING
  OVER THIS!
              I'M NOT OBSESSING.
WHILE HE WAS
PRESIDENT, ABRAHAM...
MRS. FINKELSTEIN, I'M TAKING
TIMMY DOWN TO THE OFFICE.
HE PUT HIS SCISSORS
IN THE PASTE.
          NO, I DIDN'T.
          YOU DID!
  TIMMY, AT THIS SCHOOL
  WE DO NOT BLAME OTHERS
  FOR OUR MISTAKES.
LET'S GO.
         YOU USED TO BE MY HERO.
SO, WHAT WOULD
CAUSE HIM TO ACT OUT LIKE THAT?
       SICK GRANDPARENT PERHAPS?
     NO. ALL OF HIS GRANDPARENTS
     ARE DOING JUST FINE.
          GRANNY'S NOT ON
          HER LAST LEGS?
NO.
           IS SHE STILL ON
           SOLID FOODS?
      SORRY, I'M-I'M NOT SURE
      WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
     NO, I'M SORRY. I'M JUST
     GRASPING FOR SOMETHING.
        THIS IS SO
        ATYPICAL OF TIMMY.
     I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM
     TO DESTROY SCHOOL PROPERTY.
       WELL, I DIDN'T
       DO ANYTHING!
   PRINCIPAL DARBY STUCK
   THE SCISSORS IN THE PASTE!
AND NOW YOU'RE LYING TO US.
YOU'RE OUT OF THE CUB SCOUTS.
         OH, I'M NOT SURE
         THAT'S NECESSARY.
           BUT I LOVE
           THE CUB SCOUTS!
    HE SEEMS PRETTY EMOTIONAL.
    ARE YOU SURE NOBODY'S DYING?
                NOBODY IN OUR
                FAMILY IS DYING!
OH.
OKAY. WHO CAN TELL ME THE NAMES
OF THE FIRST THREE PRESIDENTS?
           WASHINGTON, ADAMS,
           JEFFERSON. EASY!
         MR. SAVOLI, CAN I SPEAK
         TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
ALL RIGHT, UH, START
READING CHAPTER TWO, KIDS.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
         SO IT TURNS OUT MOLLY
         REALLY DID GO TO VEGAS,
           BUT NOT TO VISIT
           HER GRANDMOTHER.
            THE OLD LADY'S
            IN FINE HEALTH.
     REALLY?
                 YES.
          THE FAMILY CONFIRMED
          THAT FOR ME.
      SO I DID A LITTLE DIGGING
      AND I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH.
         SHE WENT TO VEGAS
         TO VISIT HER BOYFRIEND.
    HE'S A MUSICIAN. HIS BAND
    IS PLAYING AT THE HARD ROCK.
<i>OKAY, SO, IN </i>
<i>RETROSPECT,  A FEW </i>
<i>FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS</i>
<i> MIGHT HAVE BEEN</i>
<i> A GOOD IDEA, LIKE,</i>
<i> "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE FAMILY</i>
<i> CONFIRMED THAT FOR ME?"</i>
<i> OR, "WHAT'S THE</i>
<i> BOYFRIEND'S BAND?"</i>
<i> OR, "HOW DID YOU FIND</i>
<i> THIS OUT EXACTLY?"</i>
<i> INSTEAD,</i>
<i> I SAID THIS.</i>
SHIT.
I'M SO SORRY, BUDDY.
         SHE WOULDN'T RETURN MY
         CALLS, SO I TEXTED HER.
         TOLD HER I WASN'T GONNA
         BE SOME GUY WHO JUST
      KEPT HER COMPANY WHILE HER
      BOYFRIEND WAS ON THE ROAD.
      HOW DO I PICK THESE WOMEN?
      I'M AN IDIOT.
HEY, HEY, I WOULD'VE BEEN FOOLED
BY SOME OF THESE PEOPLE TOO.
LIKE MICHELLE, I SEE HER
AT THE GYM, LIKE, EVERY DAY
AND I THINK, MAN,
SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF GIRL THAT WOULD
RUN OFF WITH A RODEO CLOWN.
<i>WELL, NOW I JUST</i>
<i> SEEM LIKE AN IDIOT,</i>
<i> BUT THINK ABOUT IT.</i>
<i> IF YOUR BEST FRIEND TOLD</i>
<i> YOU SOMETHING LIKE THIS,</i>
<i> YOUR INSTINCT</i>
<i> WOULDN'T BE TO QUESTION.</i>
<i> YOUR INSTINCT</i>
<i> WOULD BE TO HELP.</i>
SO, DON'T BE
SO HARD ON YOURSELF
FOR GETTING IT
WRONG ABOUT MOLLY.
I-I GOT GOOD VIBES
FROM HER TOO.
               YEAH, WELL,
               THANKS, JAY.
    LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
    I'M GONNA GO HOME EARLY.
          I GOT SOME TRINKETS
          TO GET RID OF.
        EASY THERE, PHILIP.
 DON'T GET IN TOO DEEP UNTIL YOU
 KNOW WHAT SHE'S REALLY ABOUT.
 RUMOR HAS IT SHE'S BEEN
 PLAYING XBOX WITH BILLY SUZUKI.
MICHELLE? JASON?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
           I ASKED MICHELLE
           TO COME HERE WITH ME
       BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING
       YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND.
    WE JUST HAD A GOOD
    TALK AT THE GYM.
                IF THIS IS ABOUT
 GETTING BACK TOGETHER,
 I AM DEFINITELY NOT INTERESTED.
     TRUST ME, THIS IS NOT ABOUT
     US GETTING BACK TOGETHER.
           WE THOUGHT
           YOU SHOULD READ THIS.
THE NEUROCHEMICAL CONNECTION
       BETWEEN ROMANTIC LOVE
       AND PSYCHOSIS."
      NICE TOPIC. WHAT DOES
      THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME?
    LET'S JUST SAY
    YOU INSPIRED IT.
        YOU'RE CALLING ME CRAZY?
           WHO'S THE ONE WITH
           THE CLOWN FETISH?
CHARLIE, DID YOU EVER
ACTUALLY SEE BUCKEY OR THUNDER?
         NO. YOU KNOW WHY?
        BECAUSE WOMEN DON'T
        USUALLY INTRODUCE YOU
     TO THE GUY THEY'RE CHEATING
     ON YOU WITH, OR HIS HORSE.
JUST READ THIS, OKAY?
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND
THAT WHEN YOU FALL IN LOVE,
IT MESSES UP YOUR
BRAIN CHEMISTRY
AND MAKES YOU
DELUSIONAL.
         NOW I'M DELUSIONAL?
  MICHELLE.
WHEN PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE,
THE BRAIN UNDERGOES
A TRANSFORMATION.
DOPAMINE LEVELS
ARE ELEVATED
AND SEROTONIN LEVELS ARE
DIMINISHED. THAT'S NORMAL.
BUT IN A FEW CASES,
PARTICULARLY IN SUBJECTS
WITH A RICH IMAGINATION,
ROMANTIC DISPOSITION...
  PEOPLE LIKE YOU,
  BASICALLY...
IT'S MUCH,
MUCH WORSE.
AND LOVE RENDERS THEM,
WELL, TECHNICALLY...
PSYCHOTIC.
             I AM NOT PSYCHOTIC.
       I LOVED YOU AND YOU LOVED
       A CLOWN. END OF STORY.
I'M SORRY. THE DOCTOR
IN ME WANTS TO HELP YOU,
BUT I JUST, I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
     EXCUSE ME FOR BEING BITTER,
     BUT BECAUSE OF YOU I CAN'T
       SHOW MY FACE IN MONTREAL.
THERE WAS NO REALITY SHOW!
EVERY TIME WE WENT TO HOLLYWOOD,
THERE WERE CAMERAS EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE CALLED TOURISTS.
            THEY WERE CANADIAN
            CAMERAMEN INCOGNITO.
       THINK ABOUT IT.
       CANADIANS BLEND RIGHT IN.
I TRIED EXPLAINING THIS TO HIM
WHEN I WAS WRITING MY PAPER,
  AND HE WAS IN
  DENIAL THEN TOO.
                       AH.
MAYBE YOU CAN
GET THROUGH TO HIM.
THANKS. WE REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU COMING BY.
                  CLOWN HUMPER.
NO, CHARLIE, I'D ACTUALLY SAY
SHE'S THE OPPOSITE OF THAT,
WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE.
         ALL SHE DID WAS SEIZE
         THE OPPORTUNITY
     TO COME OVER HERE AND COVER
     FOR HER INDISCRETIONS.
WELL, I SERIOUSLY DOUBT THAT,
AND I'M WORRIED THAT
YOU MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN IT
WRONG ABOUT MOLLY TOO.
        MOLLY? MOLLY'S SLEEPING
        WITH THE BASS PLAYER
          IN THE BAND
          DIRTY LITTLE SECRET.
   THAT'S CRAZY!
             I KNOW.
             THE BASS PLAYER.
            WOMEN NEVER GO
            FOR THE BASS PLAYER.
 NO! NO!
 IT'S ALL CRAZY!
TELL ME
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.
 WELL, SHE MET THE BAND WHEN SHE
 DANCED IN ONE OF THEIR VIDEOS.
 AND YOU KNOW THAT
 FOR A FACT?
      MOLLY WAS A DANCER
      AND THE BAND MADE A VIDEO.
        AND?
       PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.
       CONNECT THE DOTS!
WHAT DOTS? I THINK
YOU'RE TAKING A GIANT LEAP!
    IT SAYS ON HER FACEBOOK PAGE
    THAT SHE'S A FAN OF THEIRS.
I'M A FAN OF HUEY LEWIS!
I'M NOT SLEEPING WITH HIM!
         JASON,
         READ BETWEEN THE LINES.
          THAT'S CODE
          TO HER GIRLFRIENDS
      TO LET THEM KNOW
      SHE'S HOOKING UP WITH HIM.
   HELL, THEY EVEN WROTE A SONG
   ABOUT MOLLY-- "HEY, LUCINDA."
I'M NO SONGWRITER,
BUT WOULDN'T THEY HAVE CALLED
 A SONG ABOUT MOLLY
 "HEY, MOLLY"?
        N-NO, NO, NO. THEY NEVER
        USE THE REAL NAMES.
        "LONG TALL SALLY" WAS
        ABOUT A WOMAN NAMED JOAN
WHO WAS ACTUALLY
             SHORT AND FAT.
       BUT "SHORT FAT JOAN"
       DIDN'T HAVE A RING TO IT.
          TRUST ME,
          THE SONG IS ABOUT HER.
      "LUCINDA WALKS LIKE A LADY
      BUT CRIES LIKE A BABY"?
               THAT DESCRIBES
               MOLLY TO A "T"!
     G...
          I-I DIDN'T MEAN
          TO STARTLE YOU
   BY POPPING IN LIKE THIS, BUT
   I THINK I LEFT MY PHONE HERE.
HOLY SHIT.
        IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
        IT WAS STRANGE AT FIRST,
  BUT THEN I KIND OF LIKED BEING
  AWAY FROM CALLS AND EMAILS
              FOR A FEW DAYS.
           CAN I HELP YOU
           LOOK FOR IT?
OH, UH,
I HAVE A FRIEND OVER.
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF TALKING.
HIS WIFE THREW HIM OUT.
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.
                      YIKES.
                 WELL, I'LL WAIT
                 HERE THEN?
GOOD IDEA.
HE'S A LITTLE TESTY.
UH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU FORGOT TO ASK HER
HOW HER ORGY WAS.
            NOT NOW. I GOTTA
            FIND THAT PHONE.
            THE ROOF. I'LL BET
            IT'S ON THE ROOF!
             I GOT IT.
          I JUST GOTTA DELETE
          MY MESSAGES.
        HOW MANY?
NICE.
             NO, NOT ALL OF
             THESE ARE FROM ME.
                 TWO ARE FROM
                 HER MOTHER.
             HEY. SORRY TO
             TAKE SO LONG,
            BUT JASON HAD
            ANOTHER MELTDOWN.
             HE'S A MESS
             OF A HUMAN.
  I HOPE HE'S OKAY.
          OH, HE'LL BOUNCE BACK.
          HE ALWAYS DOES.
  THAT'S GOOD.
                            MMM.
    SO, UM, QUICK THING.
                    HMM?
AND THIS IS-THIS IS NUTS,
BUT I WON A TRIP TO LA JOLLA
   AND I WAS GONNA
   USE IT THIS WEEKEND.
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU'D LIKE TO COME WITH ME.
              WOW. O-OKAY.
             S-SURE. ABSOLUTELY.
             SOUNDS GOOD.
RIGHT ON.
 I'LL TAKE THAT
 AS A YES?
                     YEAH.
I'LL SEE YOU
FRIDAY.
                   YEAH.
                   THIS...
               IS MIND BLOWING.
WHOA! EASY THERE.
THIS IS GREAT NEWS!
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT
YOUR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS.
IT WASN'T YOU
VERSUS SOME OTHER DUDE,
 IT WAS YOU
 VERSUS YOUR OWN MIND.
         SO I'M NOT A LOSER WITH
         WOMEN, BUT I'M NUTS?
            EITHER WAY I SHOULD
            JUST PACK IT IN.
  NO. CHARLIE.
 YOU CAN DO THIS.
YOU CAN FALL IN LOVE
AND NOT GO CRAZY.
<i>SO WHEN YOU</i>
<i> THINK ABOUT IT,</i>
<i> THIS IS REALLY</i>
<i> A LOT TO TAKE IN.</i>
<i> IT'S LIKE YOU'RE READING</i>
<i> YOUR OWN AUTOBIOGRAPHY</i>
<i> AND SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE</i>
<i> THAT NINE CHAPTERS</i>
<i> WERE WRITTEN</i>
<i> BY A LUNATIC,</i>
<i> AND THAT LUNATIC</i>
<i> TURNED OUT TO BE YOU.</i>
    SO, I TOLD
    MY NANA ABOUT YOU.
                      YOU DID?
I WAS PLANNING ON
TELLING HER ANYWAY,
BUT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE ME A CHOICE.
THE CANTALOUPES FILLED UP
HER ENTIRE BASEMENT.
   WHAT WAS UP
   WITH THAT?
              BEEN MEANING
              TO TELL YOU, UM,
        THERE WAS A MISHAP AT
        THE SIN CITY FRUIT BARN.
          THEY MIXED MY ORDER UP
          WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S.
          NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
          I HAVE A $3,000 CHARGE
           FOR CANTALOUPES!
           THIS HAS GOTTEN UGLY.
             CITIBANK'S INVOLVED
             AND EVERYTHING.
    OH!
I MEAN, I FIGURED IT WAS
SOME KIND OF MISTAKE.
                       MM-HMM.
YOU KNOW? ONLY A LUNATIC WOULD
SEND A THOUSAND CANTALOUPES.
                     EXACTLY.
"QUILTING." Q IS 20
  WITH A DOUBLE LETTER,
  PLUS EIGHT IS 28
   WITH A TRIPLE
   WORD IS 84,
 PLUS THE 50-POINT
 BONUS IS...
            ONE THIRTY-FOUR.
  ONE THIRTY-FOUR.
I'M KICKING YOUR ASS.
            YEAH, WELL, ALL THAT
            IS ABOUT TO CHANGE.
                "ZAXPULT."
                30, 31, 51.
HOLD ON.
WHAT'S A ZAXPULT?
    IT'S A SMALL, FLAT SHOE WORN
    BY MEXICAN PEASANT BOYS.
      YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU'VE
      NEVER HEARD OF A ZAXPULT?
   CHEATER!
             WELL, I WOULDN'T
             HAVE TO CHEAT IF
           YOU WEREN'T SOME KIND
           OF SCRABBLE SAVANT.
       I NEED SOME
       INFORMATION, PLEASE,
       HANDSOME CONCIERGE.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BURY
MY HEAD IN YOUR BOSOM,
          HOTEL GUEST.
      AND BURY IT YOU SHALL,
      YOU SILLY BOY.
   I LIKE THE WAY YOU FILL OUT
   YOUR UNIFORM, HORATIO.
              OH!
     HEY.
"I LIKE THE WAY YOU FILL OUT
YOUR UNIFORM, HORATIO."
   UH, THAT'S A NOTE
   I WROTE TO THE CONCIERGE.
   WHY?
         UH, YOU KNOW,
          THEY NEVER SEEM TO GET
          ENOUGH COMPLIMENTS.
  OKAY. WELL, HIS NAME'S
  NOT HORATIO, IT'S BOB.
                    YOU MET HIM?
YOU CAN MEET HIM TOO.
HE'S RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.
           OH, I WOULDN'T
           KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
          WHAT, WITH HIM BEING
          SO HANDSOME AND ALL.
    SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
    A CRUSH ON HIM.
NO. NO.
          I'VE NEVER EVEN MET
          BIG BOB THE CONCIERGE.
          JUST ADMIRED HIM
          FROM AFAR, UNLIKE YOU,
         WHO WAS BLESSED WITH
         MEETING HIM PERSONALLY.
I WOULDN'T CALL IT A BLESSING.
I MEAN, HE RENTED BIKES FOR US.
            YOU TWO ARE GOING
            FOR A BIKE RIDE?
    YEAH, I'M GOING BIKE RIDING
    WITH THE CONCIERGE.
  FINE. THEN YOU WON'T MIND IF I
  ASK THE MAID TO GO FOR A SWIM.
I'M SORRY.
    WHY ARE YOU
    ACTING SO WEIRD?
           I'M SORRY. I-I THINK
           IT'S MY BLOOD SUGAR.
                IF I DON'T EAT
                IN A WHILE,
          I START TO FEEL
          A LITTLE, UH, STRANGE.
HMM. WOW. GO GET
YOURSELF A COOKIE.
I'M GONNA CHANGE.
                       OKAY.
 YEAH, I'M JUST CHECKING ON MY
 BICYCLE RESERVATIONS FOR TODAY.
            CHARLIE DARBY.
         YOU DON'T HAVE
         A RESERVATION FOR ME.
            WELL, EAT ME!
         OH, I'M LISTED UNDER
         MOLLY KINGSTON?
         WONDERFUL. THANK YOU.
         DON'T EAT ME.
            THIS IS AMAZING.
        YOU KNOW WHO I THINK
        WOULD REALLY ENJOY THIS?
IF YOU BRING UP THE
CONCIERGE ONE MORE TIME,
YOU'RE WALKING BACK.
              POINT MADE.
CAN WE PULL OVER
FOR A SEC?
            CAN YOU GRAB US
            SOME WATERS?
YEAH. YEAH. SURE. OKAY.
I'LL, UH, BE RIGHT BACK.
                GREAT.
HEY.
             YOU LOOK GREAT.
WHAT HAVE
                YOU BEEN UP TO?
THE SAME OLD
   STUFF. OUCH!
  OH, MY GOD.
  CHARLIE!
HEY! OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU OKAY?
                 HEY.
        YEAH. I'M S-SORRY.
        DIDN'T MEAN TO SHOW OFF.
         IT LOOKS LIKE YOU
         FELL OFF THE BIKE.
    YEAH, TO THE
    NAKED EYE, YEAH,
  BUT IN ACTUALITY
  I WAS PERFORMING A STUNT.
               WELL, IT WAS,
               UH, AWESOME.
             OKAY.
THIS IS JOSH.
WE WENT TO HIGH
SCHOOL TOGETHER.
           OH. WERE YOU
           GUYS FUCKIES?
           BUDDIES? WERE
           YOU GUYS BUDDIES?
THIS IS BLEEDING
REALLY BAD.
YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?
                   YEAH.
PRETTY NASTY SPILL. WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET YOU TO FIRST AID.
  YEAH.
          ALL RIGHT. OH.
COME ON.
                WATCH YOUR STEP.
                EASY.
           OKAY.
                 GO ON IN THERE.
  HERE.
             OOH!
                GIMMIE THE FOOT.
                THAT'S IT.
ALL RIGHT, I'M RIGHT
BEHIND YOU, OKAY?
           YOU-YOU'RE
           NOT COMING?
OH, DON'T I HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THE BIKE?
             OH. OH.
          JOSH COULD DEAL
          WITH THE BIKE.
SURE, I'LL TAKE
CARE OF THE BIKE.
I CAN GIVE YOU A LIFT
TO FIRST AID AS WELL.
OKAY.
        UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
        I'M ALL RIGHT.
         I'M ALL RIGHT.
         I'LL JUST, UH,
        I'LL USE MY SHIRT
        AS A TOURNIQUET.
             I DON'T THINK
             THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
          UH, IF I BLEED OUT,
          I BLEED OUT.
   ONE THING YOU'LL COME TO
   LEARN ABOUT ME IS THAT I HAVE
           AN INCREDIBLY HIGH
           TOLERANCE FOR PAIN.
THAT'S ENOUGH! YOU'RE THE MOST
JEALOUS PERSON I'VE EVER SEEN.
I MEAN, YOU'D RATHER DIE
THAN LEAVE ME ALONE WITH JOSH.
        I AM NOT GOING TO DIE.
         WORST CASE SCENARIO,
         I END UP IN A COMA.
  I HATE JEALOUSY,
  CHARLIE.
   SO JUST RELAX.
 I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
 I REALLY LIKE YOU,
 OR I WOULDN'T HAVE
 TAKEN YOU AWAY.
AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
JOSH AND I WERE NEVER FUCKIES.
          WELL, I WOULDN'T
          BLAME YOU IF YOU WERE.
HELL, I WOULDN'T MIND
           BEING HIS FUCKIE.
             MOLLY, ALL MEN
             ARE JEALOUS.
NOT LIKE THIS.
HE WAS JEALOUS OF ME
TALKING TO THE CONCIERGE.
I MEAN, REALLY HE ACTED
KIND OF WEIRD ALL WEEKEND.
     SEE, I THINK BECAUSE
     CHARLIE'S SUCH A GREAT GUY,
      YOU'RE EXPECTING HIM TO
      BE PERFECT, BUT HE IS NOT.
       NO ONE IS, SO STOP
       EXPECTING HIM TO BE.
       A BIG PART OF LOVE
       IS ACCEPTANCE.
     SPOKEN LIKE A WOMAN WHO'S
     BEEN MARRIED FOR TEN YEARS.
       EXACTLY.
YOU KNOW,
WILL DOES SOME SHIT
 THAT DRIVES ME
 OUT OF MY MIND.
BUT I KNOW THAT HE'S
A REALLY GREAT PERSON.
  SO IS CHARLIE.
               YEAH. NO, I GUESS
               YOU'RE RIGHT.
MOLLY, HE'S AMAZING.
HE'S SMART,
HE'S FUNNY, HE'S CUTE.
HONESTLY I THINK HE'S LIKE
THE MOST STABLE PERSON
YOU HAVE EVER
 GONE OUT WITH.
  AND I THOUGHT THAT
  HAVING SELF-AWARENESS
  WOULD CHANGE THINGS.
  MAN, WAS I WRONG.
       THAT'S WHAT WE CALL
       INSIGHT FALLACY.
  JUST BECAUSE A PATIENT HAS
  SELF-AWARENESS ABOUT SOMETHING
    DOESN'T MEAN THEY CAN
    AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE IT.
    I MEAN, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
    IT'S OUT OF YOUR CONTROL.
    IT'S LIKE SOMEONE TRYING
    TO QUIT A DRUG ADDICTION.
  YEAH. LIKE WITH HORATIO.
   I WANTED TO WALK AWAY,
   BUT I COULDN'T.
       OF COURSE NOT.
       LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
        AND PLEASE DON'T
        ANSWER IN ANY DETAIL.
    WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST
    EXPERIENCES WITH GIRLS LIKE?
  IN A WORD, REJECTION.
I GUESS IT ALL STARTED WHEN
I WAS LIKE THREE AND A HALF.
         OKAY, THAT'S IT.
         LOOK.
    CLEARLY YOU'RE DEALING WITH
    SOME SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES,
    AND THAT'S AS MUCH DIAGNOSIS
    AS I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH.
        PLUS, YOU'RE MY BOSS.
         AND I SPECIALIZE
         IN 12 AND UNDER.
     I RESPECT THAT.
          SO... THIS IS IT.
     THIS ONE.
                YEAH.
        YEAH.
             WHAT DO
             YOU THINK?
         I LIKE IT.
 YOU DO?
           YEAH.
OH, I CAN SEE IT.
I SEE SAN PEDRO'S
MOST SUCCESSFUL DANCE SCHOOL.
              SORRY.
           OH. SORRY,
           I HAVE TO GRAB THIS.
          OH, SURE.
 EXCUSE ME.
  HELLO?
                  HEY.
                  YEAH.
  SON OF A BITCH. OH.
                    WHAT?
   IT JUST HIT ME.
I TOTALLY FORGOT TO BRING BACK
ANY SOUVENIRS FROM LA JOLLA.
  OH. HOW ABOUT YOU?
YOU BRING BACK ANY DOODADS FOR
A SPECIAL FRIEND YOU MAY HAVE?
                   NO. WHY?
        UH...
       SHE SMUGGLED BACK
       A GIFT FROM LA JOLLA,
        A SWEATSHIRT FOR
        A GUY, A BIG GUY.
   WHAT BIG GUY?
              I DON'T KNOW.
   AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FOR
   SOMEONE NAMED RANDY HOPPER,
   BUT I RAN MOLLY'S FAMILY TREE
   AND IT TURNS OUT
              SHE AND HOPPER
              ARE FIRST COUSINS.
           UNLESS THEY'RE
           KISSING COUSINS.
       I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT
       BIG BOB, THE CONCIERGE.
    BUT IT PUZZLES ME WHY
    SHE'D GET SOMETHING FOR HIM
  WHEN HE GETS A 30%
  EMPLOYEE DISCOUNT ON CLOTHING.
CHARLIE, I THINK IT MIGHT BE A
GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO TELL MOLLY
ABOUT YOUR CONDITION.
         OH, SURE, GREAT IDEA.
          THAT WOULDN'T FREAK
          HER OUT OR ANYTHING.
I DON'T KNOW. I THINK, UM,
I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER
 IF SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT
 YOU WERE GOING THROUGH.
                           LOOK.
  I'M NOT EVEN BEING CRAZY HERE.
  I SAW THE SHIRT.
          I FELT ITS SOFT,
          COTTONY FABRIC.
    WHY WOULD SHE DENY HAVING IT
    UNLESS IT WAS FOR SOMEONE
         SHE DIDN'T WANT ME
         TO KNOW ABOUT?
      IT HAS TO BE FOR SOMEONE.
I CAN GUARANTEE
I KNOW WHO IT'S FOR.
IT'S A VERY SWEET THING
YOU WANT TO MEET MY DAD.
                 OH.
   DADDY.
        HEY, HEY, HEY.
           HEY, I... HI.
              OH.
       OKAY, OKAY. OKAY.
       THAT WAS QUITE
       SOME HUG, SON.
WELL, THERE'S MORE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.
          HUH. HEY, MOL.
                         HI.
           ALL RIGHT,
           NOW WHAT?
                  OH, SORRY.
                I WAS GOING FOR
                THE SANDWICH.
             OOH. OOH.
             I JUST GOT A CHILL.
                   IT'S A LITTLE
                   COLD IN HERE.
              OH. LET'S SEE.
IT'S 83 DEGREES.
              WELL, I GUESS
              IT'S JUST ME THEN.
             WE DARBYS ARE A
             THIN-BLOODED TRIBE.
 WELL, I'M ROASTING,
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY WITH
THE FIREPLACE GOING.
YES, DEAR, BUT,
          CHARLIE'S OUR GUEST
        AND IF HE'S COLD, UH,
        I CAN CRANK IT UP TO 87.
            OH, THAT'S AWFULLY
            KIND OF YOU,
   BUT PERHAPS YOU COULD PROVIDE
   SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF.
     MIGHT YOU HAVE A SWEATSHIRT
     I COULD BORROW?
I'LL GET YOU A SWEATER.
        I'D PREFER A SWEATSHIRT.
               IF YOU HAVE
               ANYTHING 50 POLY,
      50 COTTON, BATTLESHIP GRAY
      WITH A CUTE SLOGAN,
               THAT'D BE NICE.
      CHARLIE.
          OH, SORRY.
          IT'S AN ALLERGY THING.
I CAN GIVE YOU MY SNUGGIE.
         I DON'T WANT A SNUGGIE,
         I WANT A SWEATSHIRT.
                   WOW.
              I'M... SO SORRY.
        I DIDN'T MEAN TO FLY OFF
        THE HANDLE LIKE THAT.
            I-I THINK I'M JUST
            A LITTLE ANXIOUS
       MEETING SOMEONE'S PARENTS
       FOR THE FIRST TIME.
            IT COULD BE A BIT OF
            A TENSE SITUATION.
            OF COURSE, I-I'LL
            GET YOU A SWEATER.
            SWEATSHIRT.
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE
SWEATING UP A STORM.
        I'M A LITTLE WARMER NOW.
        THANK YOU.
      OH.
     UH, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
     I'LL JUST USE THE RESTROOM.
I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW
WHY HE'S ACTING LIKE THIS.
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
BECAUSE HE REALLY LIKES YOU.
THAT'S WHY
HE'S SO NERVOUS.
            YOU KNOW,
            I SWEATED UP A STORM
              WHEN I MET YOUR
              MOTHER'S PARENTS.
   HMM, YEAH.
  WELL, NOT NEARLY TO THE DEGREE
  THAT CHARLIE'S SWEATING.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
        SWEAT THAT MUCH.
    SO, YOU GUYS
    ACTUALLY LIKE HIM.
WELL,
    FROM A PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE,
    HE'S WONDERFUL.
            HE'S A GENTLEMAN,
            HE'S GOT A GOOD JOB,
          AND HE'S A REAL PILLAR
          OF OUR COMMUNITY.
   IT WAS MY FIRST
   TIME MEETING HIM.
   SECOND TIME
   WE TOUCH VERY LITTLE.
             IN A PERFECT WORLD,
             NOT AT ALL.
OKAY, LOOK. I'M SORRY.
I THINK YOU'RE AMAZING.
I THINK THIS THING
BETWEEN US IS AMAZING.
BUT SOMETIMES I WANT
IT TO WORK SO BADLY
THAT I SUCCUMB TO
THE PRESSURE AND I
ACT LIKE AN IDIOT.
                  WELL...
               I MEAN, YOU'RE
               A CUTE IDIOT.
          BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
          MY PARENTS ACTUALLY
           LIKE YOU,
           ESPECIALLY MY DAD.
OBVIOUSLY. OR HE WOULDN'T HAVE
LET ME GET TO SECOND BASE.
<i>WOMAN MOANING)</i>
        OH. I-I KNOW I'M
        ABUSING MY
        KEY PRIVILEGES,
       AND YOU'LL FIND A, UH,
       CHARGE ON YOUR CABLE BILL
             NEXT MONTH FOR
             "FORREST HUMP."
              IT'S VALID.
    W-WAIT, WAIT.
 THERE'S SOMETHING
 YOU CAN HELP ME WITH.
        EXCELLENT. I AM YOUR
        SPIRITUAL ADVISOR.
         SELF-APPOINTED, YES.
         I'LL PUT THE COFFEE ON.
<i>LIFE IS LIKE</i>
<i> A BOX OF CONDOMS.</i>
     SO, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
     DIAGNOSED AS BEING INSANE?
DIAGNOSED? NO.
  BUT IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME
  YOU'VE HAD SOME SANITY ISSUES.
    VERY SAFE, YES.
        HERE'S WHAT
        I CAN'T FIGURE OUT.
       HOW CAN YOU DIFFERENTIATE
       BETWEEN WHEN
              YOU'RE BEING CRAZY
              VERSUS WHEN
      SOMETHING CRAZY IS
      ACTUALLY HAPPENING TO YOU?
BROTHER,
I-I WRESTLE WITH THAT ONE
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.
BUT I WILL SAY THIS.
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE CRAZY
DOESN'T MAKE YOU IMMUNE FROM
CRAZY THINGS HAPPENING TO YOU.
         THAT'S EXACTLY
         THE WAY I SEE IT!
WHAT'S GOING ON?
LET ME IN.
          IT'S JUST THAT...
        I THINK I'M COMPETING
        WITH ANOTHER GUY.
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'RE NOT
PULLING THAT OUT OF THIN AIR.
  W-WHAT'S YOUR GUT
  TELLING YOU?
     MY GUT'S TELLING ME
     THAT SOMEONE FROM HER PAST
     RESURFACED WHEN HE HEARD
     SHE WAS SEEING SOMEONE NEW,
          AND GOT SCARED
          HE WAS GONNA LOSE HER.
OF COURSE.
IT'S A STORY AS OLD AS TIME.
DO YOU KNOW WHO HE IS?
                   I WISH I DID!
DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY WHO
KNOWS HER PAST BOYFRIENDS?
TIMMY?
  PUT DOWN
  YOUR TROMBONE.
 I NEED TO TALK TO
 YOU FOR A SECOND.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THE SCISSORS INCIDENT,
AND I REALIZE NOW THAT IT
WAS MY FAULT, AND I'M SORRY.
        ABRAHAM LINCOLN
        WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
 NO, PROBABLY NOT.
             DEFINITELY NOT!
      OR ELSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE
      CALLED HIM "HONEST ABE."
  SO LET ME
  MAKE IT UP TO YOU.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY
ON THE SCHOOL SOCCER TEAM?
            I TRIED OUT,
            BUT I GOT CUT.
WELL, MAYBE I CAN WHISPER
IN COACH NOLAN'S EAR
A LITTLE BIT,
TELL HIM YOU MADE A MISTAKE.
                YOU CAN DO THAT?
I'M THE PRINCIPAL.
I HAVE TREMENDOUS POWER.
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO DO A FAVOR FOR YOU,
YOU MAY HAVE TO DO
A LITTLE FAVOR FOR ME.
       MMM... YOU WANT SOMETHING
       FROM MY LUNCHBOX?
  NO. NO, THAT'S OKAY.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M SURE YOU
GO OVER TO YOUR AUNT'S HOUSE
FROM TIME TO TIME, RIGHT?
                         MM-HMM.
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
A REALLY LARGE MAN OVER THERE?
                         MM-HMM.
DO YOU REMEMBER HIS NAME?
              UH-UH. IT WAS
              A WEIRD NAME.
                  I THINK HE WAS
                  A DOCTOR.
    REALLY? W-WHAT
    KIND OF DOCTOR?
              I THINK
              A FAMOUS KIND.
   WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
   A FAMOUS KIND?
      I JUST REMEMBER MY MOM
      SAYING THAT HE WAS FAMOUS.
      AND I KNOW HE WAS A DOCTOR
      'CAUSE THEY ASKED HIM
              TO TAKE A LOOK
              AT MY RASH.
           MAYBE IT'S
           DR. SEUSS.
           HE'S DEAD.
               WHAT ABOUT
               DR. JANE GOODALL?
           SORRY, BUT THAT'S
           KIND OF HOT.
ONLY TO YOU.
             I WAS JUST THINKING
             OUTSIDE THE BOX.
         YEAH, WELL,
         STAY WITHIN THE BOX.
        THINK OF LOGICAL PEOPLE,
        LIKE DR. DRE.
INTERESTING.
                 MOLLY'S TRAINED
                 IN HIP-HOP.
    I KNOW HE'S
    AN EXTRA-LARGE.
      THE-THE ONLY THING THAT
      DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IS,
    TIMMY'S MOTHER ASKED THE GUY
    TO LOOK AT HIS RASH.
     WOULD YOU ASK DR. DRE
     TO LOOK AT YOUR KID'S RASH?
      WELL, I WOULD,
      BUT THAT'S JUST ME.
         LET'S PUT A PIN IN DRE.
HOW ABOUT DR. J?
             SAME RASH ARGUMENT.
   DR. WILLIAM H. COSBY, JR.?
        YOU'RE NOT HELPING.
               OH, NO.
               OH, MY GOD, NO.
                  NO! NO!
            WHAT?
                  DR. OZ!
      AMERICA'S DOCTOR?
        THE KID SAID HE HAD
        AN UNUSUAL NAME.
         WHAT'S MORE UNUSUAL
         THAN MEHMET?
I HAVE TO BE HONEST.
IF I HAD A CHOICE OF LOVERS,
I'D TAKE DR. OZ OVER YOU.
          YEAH, SO WOULD I.
  I BET HE'S AN ANIMAL.
         I'VE NOTICED HE WEARS
         HIS SCRUBS BAGGY,
 SO IT STANDS TO REASON HE LIKES
 HIS SWEATSHIRTS ROOMY AS WELL.
THAT'S WHAT
I READ ABOUT.
HE'S BEEN
           MARRIED 28 YEARS.
           THAT MAKES SENSE.
           HE GOT MARRIED YOUNG.
              NOW HE'S RICH
              AND FAMOUS.
           HE'S PICKING UP WOMEN
           LEFT AND RIGHT.
THAT'S THE VIBE
I'M GETTING FROM HIM.
        YEAH, I BET THEY MET AT
        ONE OF HIS BOOK SIGNINGS
   FOR ONE OF HIS GROUNDBREAKING
   HIGH-FIBER DIET BOOKS.
YOU KNOW,
IF I WERE YOU,
A-AND LET'S BE
PERFECTLY CLEAR, I'M NOT,
BUT I WOULD JUST COME
STRAIGHT OUT AND ASK HER,
"ARE YOU HAVING AN
AFFAIR WITH MEHMET OZ?"
     I ASKED HER IF SHE BROUGHT
     BACK A SOUVENIR FOR ANYONE,
       AND SHE CHOSE TO DENY IT.
    IF SHE WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE
    THE PRESENCE OF OZ,
       THAT WAS HER OPPORTUNITY.
WELL, JUST BRING UP HIS NAME
THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE HER,
AND IF SHE HAS A REACTION,
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL
 IF SHE'S HIDING
 SOMETHING.
         JUST BRING UP HIS NAME?
JUST BRING UP
HIS NAME.
              MEHMET.
              MEHMET.
   WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          OH, UH, NOTHING.
          SORRY.
             MEHMET.
    I'M SORRY.
    WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
                    MEHMET?
     MEHMET.
                 YES, AS IN...
 UH, MEHMET OZ?
            OH, MY GOD.
OKAY.
MY NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE,
WHY ARE YOU
BRINGING UP MEHMET OZ?
      BECAUSE HE'S AWESOME
     AND I'M REALLY INTO HIM.
    GOOD.
        HAS HE EVER BEEN IN YOU?
       EXCUSE ME?
          H-HAVE YOU EVER
          BEEN IN HIM?
                INTO HIM, A FAN,
                SO TO SPEAK?
I-I READ ONE OF HIS BOOKS,
"THIS GLAND IS YOUR GLAND."
                CAN I BORROW IT?
 YOU'RE HAVING
 HORMONAL ISSUES?
        NO. NO, I JUST ALWAYS
        WANTED TO READ IT.
SERIOUSLY, CHARLIE.
WHAT IS UP WITH YOU?
                  UP WITH ME?
YEAH, I MEAN,
WE ALWAYS END UP ON
THESE WEIRD TANGENTS
LIKE SWEATSHIRTS
OR DR. OZ.
 I REALLY, I DON'T WANT
 TO TALK ABOUT DR. OZ.
OH, THIRTEEN HOUR FLIGHT.
                FLIGHT?
YEAH,
IT'S MY BROTHER
    TEXTING ME WITH DETAILS
    ABOUT THIS WEEKEND.
    I HAD A LAST-MINUTE TRIP
    TO TUSCANY POP UP.
      HOW DOES A LAST-MINUTE
      TRIP TO TUSCANY POP UP?
                 YOU'D HAVE TO
                 HAVE YOUR OWN
     SYNDICATED TALK SHOW TO
     AFFORD SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
  WELL, MY BROTHER HARRIS
  IS PRETTY SUCCESSFUL.
     HE WAS GONNA GO,
     BUT HE CAN'T,
   SO I'M GONNA TAKE
   MY GRANDMOTHER INSTEAD.
         OH, JUST YOU AND GRANNY
          UNDER THE TUSCAN SUN?
YEAH, WE'RE STAYING IN
THIS LITTLE B&B, ANIMA MIA.
IT'S GONNA BE
BEAUTIFUL.
LUCKY YOU.
        THE MOST ROMANTIC
        COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
MMM. NOT WITH
YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
                   EXACTLY.
GOOD MORNING.
I INTERRUPT THIS QUIZ WITH
A VERY IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
EACH WEEKEND
ONE SPECIAL STUDENT
WILL GET TO TAKE HOME
THE OFFICIAL SCHOOL FLAG.
AND THIS WEEKEND
THE FLAG GOES TO...
TIMOTHY RUSSELL CLARK!
SWEET!
NOW COME WITH ME,
YOUNG PATRIOT.
THANK YOU, MR. DARBY.
THIS IS A REAL HONOR!
            NOW, I NEED YOU TO
            DO SOMETHING ELSE.
            I NEED YOU TO CALL
            YOUR GRANDMOTHER.
BUT I'M ONLY ALLOWED
TO USE IT IN EMERGENCIES.
           THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
       I WANT YOU TO ASK HER IF
       YOUR UNCLE HARRIS IS RICH
            AND IF SHE'S GOING
            AWAY THIS WEEKEND.
HI, GRANDMA.
IT'S TIMMY.
IS UNCLE HARRIS RICH,
AND ARE YOU GOING AWAY
THIS WEEKEND?
UH-HUH. OKAY.
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
         YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
         IT SOUNDED LIKE
       SHE'S NOT GOING, BUT YOUR
       BIG EAR WAS IN THE WAY.
NO, THAT'S
WHAT SHE SAID.
          I NEED MORE INFO.
         HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
         ABOUT WEARING A WIRE?
OKAY.
                CONGRATULATIONS.
          YOU'RE ON
          THE SOCCER TEAM. HERE.
   YES, I WOULD LIKE TICKETS
   TO A DR. OZ TAPING THIS WEEK.
       YOU'RE ON HIATUS?
   DOES THAT MEAN DR. OZ
   IS VACATIONING IN EUROPE?
   YOU'RE NOT AT LIBERTY TO SAY,
   OR YOU'RE COVERING FOR
       AN AFFAIR
       HE'S HAVING? OH!
                MOLLY'S SLEEPING
                WITH MEHMET OZ.
      MEHMET OZ?
OPRAH IN ON IT TOO? M-MAYBE
THEY'RE HAVING A THREE-WAY.
          OKAY, CALM DOWN.
          I'M FAIRLY SURE
          MOLLY'S NEVER HAD
          SEX WITH OPRAH.
      CHARLIE,
      LISTEN TO ME.
     MOLLY IS NOT
     SLEEPING WITH DR. OZ.
YOU HEAR ME?
SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH OZ.
           I GUESS
           THAT'S POSSIBLE.
           NONE OF THIS
           IS WITHOUT PROOF.
WHAT PROOF DO YOU HAVE?
IF YOU TELL ME THE SWEATSHIRT,
I AM GOING TO HAVE TO KILL YOU.
        FINE. BUT IT WASN'T
        IN THE FATHER'S CLOSET.
<i>OKAY, SO THIS IS</i>
<i> WHERE I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIM</i>
<i> STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL.</i>
<i> HE CLEARLY NEEDS HELP.</i>
<i> I SHOULD HAVE</i>
<i> BEEN LIKE...</i>
  YOU WENT IN
  THE FATHER'S CLOSET?
<i> OR EVEN...</i>
  YOU WENT IN
  THE FATHER'S CLOSET?!
<i>INSTEAD, I JUST TRIED </i>
<i>TO LISTEN  AND TALK SOME SENSE</i>
<i>INTO HIM.</i>
 YOU WENT
 IN THE FATHER'S CLOSET?
         OF COURSE I WENT IN
         THE FATHER'S CLOSET!
         I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND
         OUT THE TRUTH, JASON.
         THIS IS A GREAT WOMAN
         WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
         I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW
         WHO I'M UP AGAINST.
CHARLIE, YOU ALWAYS CONJURE UP
SOME IMAGINARY ENEMY,
SOME GUY YOU THINK
YOU CAN'T COMPETE WITH.
BUCKEY THE CLOWN,
BAS THE CONVICT,
THE BLACK EYED PEAS!
     THE OTHER TIMES THAT
     MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE, YES,
         BUT THIS TIME
         IS DIFFERENT.
    NO! NO, IT'S NOT!
    LIKE ALWAYS,
    THIS IS YOU
TELLING YOURSELF THAT YOU'RE
NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER!
<i>SORRY TO</i>
<i> KEEP INTERRUPTING,</i>
<i> BUT FOR THE RECORD, I'M MAKING</i>
<i> SOME VERY GOOD POINTS HERE.</i>
<i> THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHEN</i>
<i> YOU'RE ALONE AND TALKING</i>
<i> TO A CRAZY PERSON,</i>
<i> IT DOESN'T MATTER</i>
<i> HOW GOOD YOUR POINTS ARE</i>
<i> IF THE OTHER GUY'S INSANE.</i>
<i> AND I-I'M NOT TRYING</i>
<i> TO MAKE EXCUSES HERE.</i>
<i> BELIEVE ME, I-I KNOW</i>
<i> I FAILED MY BEST FRIEND</i>
<i> WHEN HE NEEDED ME,</i>
<i> AND I ACCEPT FULL</i>
<i> RESPONSIBILITY</i>
<i> FOR THE FIASCO THAT</i>
<i> IS ABOUT TO UNFOLD.</i>
  THIS IS YOU
  TELLING YOURSELF
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER!
     NOT TRUE. I THINK I'M
     PLENTY GOOD ENOUGH FOR HER.
 S-SURE, I'M NOT A HEART SURGEON
 WITH MY OWN BRILLIANT TV SHOW.
    YOU'RE SEEING
    A DOCTOR, RIGHT?
          YEAH,
          I-I LIKE HIM A LOT.
                BUT GOING BACK,
                THERE'S NO WAY
         YOU CAN TELL ME THAT
         MOLLY IS NOT GOING AWAY
          WITH ANOTHER MAN,
          ESPECIALLY
         WHEN HER GRANDMOTHER
         SPECIFICALLY SAID
          SHE WAS NOT
          GOING OUT OF TOWN.
  HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
                        TIMMY.
TIMMY? YOUR INFORMANT
IS NINE, CHARLIE!
HE CALLED HER AND I LISTENED IN.
WHY WOULD SHE LIE TO THE KID?
  WELL, I-I GUESS
  IT'S POSSIBLE
THAT MOLLY COULD BE
GOING WITH ANOTHER GUY.
BUT EVEN IF
THAT IS THE CASE,
THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
YEAH, THERE IS.
  I CAN TEXT HER
  AND CONFRONT HER ABOUT OZ.
        N-NO! NO!
             NO, NO, NO,
             NO, NO, NO.
          I CAN'T BE WITHOUT
          MY PHONE RIGHT NOW.
OH, AND YOU'RE STAYING
WITH ME THIS WEEKEND.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
AND DO SOMETHING STUPID
LIKE THE LAST TIME.
        I'LL BE BACK
        IN A FEW.
         KEEP YOUR SHIT
         TOGETHER.
           IT'S TOGETHER!
           STOP WORRYING.
                   I AM TOTALLY
                   IN CONTROL.
         HELLO?
               BABY BIRD,
               IT'S RED ROOSTER.
         HUH?
           IT'S PRINCIPAL DARBY.
      I'M USING A CODE NAME
      IN CASE ANYONE'S NEAR YOU.
                  WHAT DO YOU
                  HAVE FOR ME?
      I HEARD THERE WAS
      GONNA BE A PROPOSAL.
           A PROPOSAL?
      WHAT ARE YOUR SOURCES,
      BABY BIRD?
I WROTE DOWN WHAT MOMMY
AND AUNT MOLLY SAID.
       A-ARE YOU SURE YOU
       WROTE "PROPOSAL"?
    NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE NOT
    THE WORLD'S BEST SPELLER.
NO, THAT'S
WHAT I WROTE.
          ARE YOU-ARE YOU
          POSITIVE?
I'M POSITIVE.
HELLO?
                    WHA... OH.
                     UH, CIAO.
       CIAO.
                 HAVE YOU SEEN
                 THIS MAN?
    DOTTORE OZ.
     IL DOTTORE
     D'AMERICA.
              OH, MY GOD,
              YOU HAVE SEEN HIM.
          UH, DID YOU NOTICE IF
          HE WAS HOLDING A RING?
               A-A-A... WHAT
               ROOM IS HE IN?
        NO.
                 LOOK, UH,
          HE WAS WITH ANOTHER
          GUEST, MOLLY KINGSTON.
  AH, SI, SIGNORINA
  MOLLY KINGSTON.
              YEAH, D-DO YOU
              KNOW WHERE SHE IS?
     SOLO ANDATE
     A VIGNETO.
                  WHA... WHA...
                      WHA...
     VIGNETO.
      OH, TH-THE VINEYARD?
      THEY WENT TO THE VINEYARD?
  SI. ROMANTICO.
                  OH... CIAO!
        AH.
              NO!
         CHARLIE?
     MOLLY?
OH, WOW, WOW,
WHAT, WHAT A...
WHAT A SMALL WORLD.
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
                 WHAT ARE YOU
                 DOING HERE?
                  OH, MY GOD,
                  CHARLIE.
                  ARE YOU CRAZY?
YES, MOLLY.
YES, I AM.
                  SURPRISING ME
                  LIKE THIS?
                YOU KNOW,
                I AM SPEECHLESS.
    I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU CAME
    ALL THIS WAY TO SURPRISE ME.
   SURPRISE!
               OH, MY GOD,
               I AM TOUCHED.
              GENUINELY TOUCHED.
    WELL...
SURPRISE, GRANDMA!
           SURPRISE!
   NANA, THIS IS THE GUY THAT
   I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
HI. UH,
NICE TO MEET YOU.
  NICE TO MEET YOU,
  AND THANKS FOR ALL THAT MELON.
OH.
  I'M CHARLIE.
  I'M MOLLY'S BOYFRIEND.
               ANTONIO,
               BEBE'S NURSE.
I LEFT CHARLIE
     A MESSAGE SAYING
IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL
IN ITALY
AND THAT I WISHED
HE WAS HERE.
      AND HERE HE IS.
      CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
IT'S WONDERFUL.
I GUESS I SENSED SOMETHING
IN YOUR VOICE IN THE MESSAGE.
             I WAS HINTING
             A LITTLE.
   YES, YOU WERE.
AND I CAN PICK UP A HINT
WITH THE BEST OF 'EM.
         YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN
         SUCH A LONG DAY.
         WHY DON'T YOU TAKE
         THE REST OF IT OFF.
 YEAH, TAKE
 TOMORROW OFF, TOO.
           CIAO.
                    THANK YOU.
  YIKES.
SO, NANA WANTS
    TO RECREATE THE MOMENT WHERE
    MY GRAMPS PROPOSED TO HER.
    IT WAS 70 YEARS AGO TODAY,
    RIGHT HERE IN THIS VINEYARD.
            I WOULD LIKE CHARLIE
            TO PLAY MY HAROLD.
                      OH.
I WOULD BE HONORED
TO PLAY HAROLD.
               THANK YOU.
                      WOW.
               THIS IS REALLY
               COMING TOGETHER.
               I JUST, I WISH
               THAT WE COULD GET
      TO THE EXACT SPOT WHERE
      MY GRAMPS PROPOSED TO HER,
      BUT WE CAN'T GET NANA'S
      WHEELCHAIR UP THERE, SO...
OH. WHERE
IS THE SPOT?
                  IT'S ON TOP
                  OF THAT HILL.
MOLLY, GET THE CHAIR.
                    CHARLIE.
            WELL, HERE WE ARE,
            BACK AT OUR HOTEL,
      MY BLUSHING BRIDE BEBE.
                THANKS, CHARLIE.
        I THINK WE CAN STOP
        WITH THE RECREATION NOW.
             SURE THING.
      AH, BUONASERA.
                    UH...
            AH, SIGNORA,
            BUONASERA.
               COME STAI,
               SIGNORA?
                         BENE.
GRAZIE E BENE.
              THANKS FOR COMING.
        OH...
               YOU KNOW,
               I HAVE TO ADMIT,
           YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
           PRETTY STRANGE LATELY
                AND I WASN'T
                SURE ABOUT US.
              THE FACT THAT YOU
              CAME ALL THIS WAY?
                I DON'T KNOW
                WHAT TO SAY.
    OH, PLEASE.
    IT WAS NOTHING.
I LOVED MEETING NANA.
I LOVE EVERYONE IN YOUR FAMILY.
             MMM... OH, UH,
             SPEAKING OF FAMILY.
             MY SISTER ASKED ME
             TO ASK YOU NOT
       TO MENTION NANA'S ILLNESS
       IN FRONT OF TIMMY.
        SHE'S TRYING
        TO SHIELD HIM FROM THAT.
   OF COURSE SHE IS.
   I MEAN...
                    YEAH.
             HE'S IN THIS
             WEIRD PHASE LATELY.
              FIRST HE ACTED UP
              IN ART CLASS,
        HMM.
             AND THEN YESTERDAY
             HE CALLED MY MOM,
           HE ASKED HER IF SHE
           WAS GOING OUT OF TOWN
             AND-AND IF
             MY BROTHER'S RICH.
  YOUR MOM
  IS HIS GRANDMOTHER.
  YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S
  HIS GREAT-GRANDMOTHER.
                  VERY GOOD.
      THANK YOU.
I'D BETTER RUN.
      THIS IS SO FRUSTRATING.
          WE'RE IN THIS
          TOTALLY ROMANTIC PLACE
             AND I CAN'T DO
             ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
       OH.
          I HAVE THIS LACEY
          LINGERIE WITH ME, BUT,
        YOU KNOW, I JUST, I HAVE
        TO STAY WITH MY GRAM.
  HEY, LOOK,
  I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA
  BE WITH HER
  WHEN I DECIDED TO COME.
      IT'S OKAY.
                    OH.
NANA!
                       I'M BACK.
<i>I HAVE THIS</i>
<i> LACEY LINGERIE WITH ME.</i>
<i> A LAST-MINUTE</i>
<i> TRIP TO TUSCANY.</i>
<i>I GUESS</i>
<i> IT'S POSSIBLE</i>
<i> THAT MOLLY COULD BE</i>
<i> GOING WITH ANOTHER GUY.</i>
<i>I THINK</i>
<i> HE WAS A DOCTOR.</i>
<i> ANTONIO, BEBE'S NURSE.</i>
<i> I BET HE'S AN ANIMAL.</i>
HELLO?
   BEBE? IT'S CHARLIE.
   CAN I TALK TO MOLLY?
SHE WENT OUT
FOR SOME AIR.
       BULLSHIT.
WHAT?
   UH, NOTHING.
   CAN YOU LET ME IN?
CHARLIE?
       CHARLIE.
      COME ON, NANA.
      CHOP-CHOP!
     THANKS. I DIDN'T WANT TO
     LEAVE YOU ALL ALONE, BEEBS.
IT'S OKAY.
MOLLY SAID SHE'D BE
BACK IN A FEW MINUTES.
             OH, THAT'S GREAT.
        DID SHE MENTION ANYTHING
        ABOUT NURSE ANTONIO?
        HMM. OH, YES,
    THIS MORNING SHE SAID
    HE WAS A GOOD NURSE.
        OH. DID SHE SAY ANYTHING
        TO THE EFFECT OF
          ITALIAN MEN MAKE
          THE BEST LOVERS?
     HMM... NOT
     THAT I RECALL.
     BUT I AGREE
     WITH THAT.
        WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
        TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIEW?
I DON'T
SEE ANYTHING.
           IT'S TOO DARK.
             OOH, I THINK
             I SEE A CAT.
          I'M THIRSTY.
      SUCK IT UP, NANA.
"SUCK IT UP, NANA"?
CHARLIE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
             I'M, UH, PLAYING
             "SUCK IT UP, NANA."
             HAVEN'T YOU EVER
             HEARD OF THAT GAME?
                VERY BIG
                IN MY FAMILY.
            YOU OKAY?
            WHAT HAPPENED?
 CHARLIE PUT ME
 IN THE CORNER.
        SHE WAS DISRUPTIVE,
        I GAVE HER A TIME-OUT.
            I DON'T, UM,
            UNDERSTAND.
         WHY ARE YOU GOING
         THROUGH MY STUFF?
              BECAUSE...
      NANA WAS COLD. I'M JUST
      TRYING TO FIND HER A WRAP.
     I NEVER SAID
     I WAS COLD.
           YOU NEVER SAID,
           "I'M OH SO COLD.
     CAN YOU HOOK ME UP WITH
     A WRAP, SWEET CHARLIE BOY"?
 NO!
        OH-OH, LORD, I THINK
        SENILITY HAS SET IN.
 I THINK SHE CAN REMEMBER
 WHAT HAPPENED FIVE MINUTES AGO!
   SHE REMEMBERED EVERY WORD
   OF MY GRANDFATHER'S PROPOSAL,
   WHICH WAS 70 YEARS AGO.
         YEAH, BUT SHE COULD'VE
         MADE THAT STUFF UP.
              YOU DON'T KNOW.
              YOU WEREN'T THERE.
        CHARLIE, ENOUGH!
        WE NEED TO TALK.
        OUTSIDE.
          I'M STARTING
          TO LOSE PATIENCE,
           SO TELL ME THE TRUTH.
          WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
     OKAY, FINE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
I'M THE ONE ON TRIAL HERE.
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE YOU
ACTUALLY WENT OUT FOR SOME AIR?
       OF COURSE I DIDN'T.
       I LIED TO MY GRANDMOTHER.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SO WHY ARE YOU TREATING ME
LIKE I'M THE GUILTY ONE?
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
BROUGHT LINGERIE WITH YOU
WHEN YOU HAD NO IDEA
I WAS EVEN COMING.
             I BOUGHT IT
             THIS MORNING.
          I WAS BRINGING IT HOME
          TO WEAR FOR YOU.
REALLY? WELL, THEN WHY
ISN'T IT IN YOUR SUITCASE?
          BECAUSE I JUST WORE IT
          UP TO YOUR ROOM.
            OH.
         MY BAD.
                 PLEASE LEAVE.
HONEY, YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO JUST FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS
AND GET READY FOR
FLORENCE TOMORROW?
I'LL PUSH THE CHAIR.
WAIT. WAIT.
OKAY, LOOK. THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ME.
    I'VE BEEN AFRAID
    TO TELL YOU THIS...
         BUT I'M...
          INSANE.
                YOU THINK?
NOT ALL THE TIME.
JUST WHEN I FALL IN LOVE.
IT'S A REAL
PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITION.
I'M PSYCHOTIC.
         Y-YOU'RE REALLY
         HELPING YOUR CASE HERE?
BUT I CAN BEAT IT.
               YEAH, I CAN TELL.
       YOU KNOW, WHEN I SAW YOU
       STANDING IN THE VINEYARD,
        AT FIRST I THOUGHT,
        "DID HE FOLLOW ME HERE?"
      BUT I THOUGHT,
      "WHO WOULD BE CRAZY ENOUGH
    TO COME ALL THE WAY TO ITALY
    JUST TO CHECK UP ON ME?"
    NO, IT WASN'T JUST
    TO CHECK UP ON YOU.
                CHARLIE,
                TH-THIS IS OVER.
                 PLEASE JUST
                 RESPECT THAT.
   OH, I THINK YOU'RE
   BEING IMPULSIVE HERE.
OKAY, BEBE, TELL HER SHE'S
BEING IMPULSIVE AND TO...
  GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE.
    GREETINGS FROM THAILAND.
       OFF THE PORT BOW
    YOU'LL SEE THE GORGEOUS
    ISLAND OF KO SAMUI.
ITS SCENIC BEACHES HAVE MADE IT
A POPULAR HONEYMOON DESTINATION.
       YOUR PRINCIPAL
       BACK IN SAN PEDRO
       VERY MUCH WANTED
       TO VISIT IT SOMEDAY.
BUT THAT'S OKAY.
       THE GOOD SHIP
       <i> LINCOLN ELEMENTARY</i>
          SAILS ON...
         INTO THE VAST,
            DARK...
        COLD EMPTINESS.
    AND THAT'S HOW I SOOTHE
    MY CONSTIPATION.
                  POLENTA.
                  FASCINATING.
            OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
            I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
      FIRST I COULDN'T SHIT,
      NOW I CAN'T STOP SHITTING.
               LIFE, HUH?
CHARLIE, YOU
           CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS.
  SHE'S NASTY, VILE,
  BOWL-OBSESSED.
WHAT ARE MY CHOICES? HUH?
I CAN'T FALL IN LOVE.
THAT DOESN'T WORK.
SO IT'S EITHER BE ALONE
OR BE WITH PEOPLE
 THAT I FEEL ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING FOR.
            I'D RATHER BE ALONE
            THAN BE WITH HER.
   I'D RATHER
   BE ON FIRE.
                          I...
                 I-I TALKED
                 TO MICHELLE.
     OH, NO.
                NO, DON'T WORRY.
                IT'S FINE.
        I ASKED HER IF THERE
        WAS ANYTHING SHE THOUGHT
      YOU COULD DO, AND SHE SAID
      THAT NONE OF YOUR EX'S
       THAT SHE INTERVIEWED
       WERE SYMPATHETIC UNTIL
      THEY FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE
      MAGNITUDE OF YOUR PROBLEM.
              SO MAYBE IF MOLLY,
              YOU KNOW, HAD
              A SENSE OF WHAT...
PLEASE DON'T
BRING UP MOLLY.
I CAN'T RELIVE
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.
MY LIFE MAY NOT BE
PERFECT RIGHT NOW,
OR ACTUALLY REALLY,
REALLY FAR FROM PERFECT,
BUT I'D RATHER BE NUMB
THAN BE HURTING.
                 FALSE ALARM.
               NOTHING BUT AIR.
<i>WOMAN MOANING)</i>
              I TOOK 40 BUCKS
              FROM YOUR DRESSER.
                 OH. OH, YEAH.
          ANYONE WANT
          MORE CEREAL?
    YO.
                      WHEW!
         OH, THAT LIEUTENANT DAN
         IS SOME KIND OF LOVER.
CAP'N CRUNCH?
              HIT ON ME AGAIN,
              AND I'LL SNAP OFF
            YOUR COCK AND USE IT
            TO STIR MY DRINK.
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN ME ON,
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
            I HAVE HALF A MIND
            TO CLEAN YOUR PIPES.
                    OH.
         MICHELLE,
         IT'S CHARLIE.
            LISTEN.
       I NEED YOUR HELP.
           MY GOD.
           IS THAT CHARLIE?
YES. HIS FRIEND
ASKED ME TO BRING YOU HERE,
SAID THERE WAS
SOMETHING YOU NEEDED TO HEAR.
           HI.
           I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD,
  BUT THIS WILL ALL BE
  VERY CLEAR IN A FEW MINUTES.
           WE COULDN'T FULLY
           EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED
         WITHOUT, UH, A LITTLE
         HELP FROM SOME FRIENDS.
                 THANK YOU.
MOLLY.
TH-THESE ARE MY...
EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
  THIS IS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE
  MOMENT OF MY LIFE.
    AND ANOTHER TIME,
    I TOOK MY LITTLE SISTER
    CAMPING FOR THE WEEKEND,
    AND CHARLIE INSISTED
         THAT I WAS OFF HAVING
         A CONJUGAL VISIT.
          I SAW ON "60 MINUTES"
          THAT THERE'S A WEBSITE
                WHERE WOMEN
                MET CONVICTS.
  THINKING YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE
  WOMEN WAS WHERE I WENT WRONG.
         IT'S OKAY.
         I FORGIVE YOU
FOR THINKING
       I WAS A PRISON WHORE.
      TANYA. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
      WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM.
     SO MUCH SHIT.
     WHERE DO I BEGIN?
WELL, ONE DAY I HAD SOME
BLUE SPLOTCHES ON MY JEANS
THAT I GOT FROM MY NIECE'S
BIRTHDAY AT COLOR ME MINE,
AND CHARLIE THOUGHT
I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE BLUE MAN GROUP.
             THERE WERE SIX BLUE
             DOTS ON HER PANTS,
             THE EXACT NUMBER OF
             COMBINED TESTICLES
            OF THE ENTIRE GROUP.
OKAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S,
UH, IT'S GETTING LATE.
                   UH, MAYBE
                   IT'S TIME
                   FOR US TO
                   GO HOME.
          TH-THIS WAS INCREDIBLY
          KIND OF ALL OF YOU.
            AGAIN,
            A MILLION APOLOGIES.
             GOOD LUCK.
                   THANKS.
                   THANK YOU.
            GOOD NIGHT.
  WOW. THAT WAS, UH,
  THAT WAS EYE-OPENING,
  TO SAY THE LEAST.
     I TOTALLY
     GET IT NOW.
             AND IT ALL MADE
             SENSE AT THE TIME,
             JUST LIKE DR. OZ.
WHERE DID YOU EVEN
COME UP WITH THAT?
          YOUR NEPHEW SAID YOU
          DATED A FAMOUS DOCTOR.
I DATED A FINNISH
DOCTOR, NELS JARVEY.
HE'S A PODIATRIST.
                SO, I WAS CLOSE.
IT WAS-IT WAS REALLY
NICE SEEING YOU.
Y-YOU KNOW I WISH YOU
ONLY THE BEST.
                 OH, BUT W-WAIT.
           I-I THOUGHT YOU
           UNDERSTOOD ALL THIS.
I DO, AN-AND, YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD
ALL OF THIS HAS BEEN FOR YOU.
BUT YOUR CONDITION'S
LIKE A REAL THING.
SORRY, I MUST...
SOUND LIKE AN AWFUL PERSON.
          MOLLY, PLEASE DON'T...
                  APOLOGIZE.
                IT WAS MY FAULT.
OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
YOU COULDN'T HELP IT.
      GOODBYE.
HANG IN THERE, MATE.
       SO, HOW'S CHARLIE?
  NANA, YOU KNOW CHARLIE
  AND I AREN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE.
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU
SAW HIM AT DINNER.
             I DID, BUT...
        THAT WAS JUST--
        IT WAS A ONE-TIME THING.
          I LIKE HIM.
               YOU DO?
WE WERE MARRIED BRIEFLY,
     YOU KNOW.
   NANA, YOU SHOULD KNOW,
   CHARLIE FOLLOWED US TO ITALY.
YEAH, I KNEW IT
THE FIRST MOMENT I SAW HIM.
       AND IT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU?
     NOT REALLY.
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN SOME OF
THE STUFF I DID WHEN POP-POP
AND I WERE COURTING.
   I ACCUSED HIM OF
   HAVING AN AFFAIR
   WITH ONE OF THE
   OTHER RIVETERS.
           AND WHAT DID
           POP-POP DO?
    WHAT DO YOU
    THINK HE DID?
  YOU'RE SITTING HERE
  NOW, AREN'T YOU?
         GOOD MORNING.
 WELCOME TO THE SPRING CONCERT.
        FIRST, BEFORE WE
          GET STARTED,
      LET ME INTRODUCE OUR
   BAND TEACHER, MR. THORPE.
HELLO, LINCOLN ELEMENTARY.
WELCOME TO
THE SPRING CONCERT.
I AM YOUR
BAND DIRECTOR.
   ARE YOU OKAY?
                     YEAH.
DO YOU STILL WANT ME
TO WEAR THAT WIRE?
           NO. THANK YOU, TIMMY.
               THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
               HAVE A GOOD SHOW.
                          MOLLY.
       HEY.
               IT'S...
               GOOD TO SEE YOU.
          UH, TIMMY WILL BE
          REALLY HAPPY YOU CAME.
   I DIDN'T COME
   TO SEE TIMMY.
             WHO DID YOU
             COME TO SEE?
PLEASE SAY ME.
   LOOK, YOU KNOW,
   I-I WAS THINKING.
IF CRIMINALS CAN PLEAD INSANITY,
THEN WHY SHOULDN'T YOU?
A-ALL YOU DID WAS...
          FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.
      RIGHT.
             I WANT TO KISS YOU
             SO BADLY RIGHT NOW.
SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
  SCHOOL HAS SO MANY RULES ABOUT
  PUBLIC DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION.
     I... AH, SCREW IT.
     I'LL GIVE MYSELF DETENTION.
<i> REMEMBER HER?</i>
<i> SHE SAW ONE STRAY,</i>
<i> SHINY ROCK</i>
<i> AND THOUGHT HER BOYFRIEND ZOG</i>
<i> WAS GETTING IT ON WITH UBA.</i>
<i> WELL, IT GOT A LOT WORSE</i>
<i> BEFORE IT GOT BETTER.</i>
<i> UNTIL, LUCKILY,</i>
<i> SHE FOUND THE HELP SHE NEEDED.</i>
<i> BUT MORE IMPORTANT,</i>
<i> HER RELATIONSHIP WITH</i>
<i> ZOG TURNED A CORNER.</i>
<i> AND AS SHE DEVELOPED</i>
<i> A DEEPER BOND WITH HIM,</i>
<i> SHE STARTED GOING BACK</i>
<i> TO HER OLD SELF.</i>
<i> AND EVERYTHING WORKED OUT</i>
<i> FOR HER AND ZOG</i>
<i> AND THEIR THOUSANDS</i>
<i> OF DESCENDANTS.</i>
<i> SAME THING WITH CHARLIE.</i>
<i> HE GOT SOME HELP TOO.</i>
<i> SHE EXPLAINED THAT</i>
<i> FOR SOMEONE LIKE HIM,</i>
<i> THE FIRST STAGES OF LOVE</i>
<i> CAN FEEL LIKE THIS,</i>
<i> WHICH IS REALLY</i>
<i> NO WAY TO LIVE.</i>
<i>BUT SHE ALSO SAID THAT AS MOLLY</i>
<i>AND CHARLIE'S RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>EVOLVES OVER TIME,</i>
<i> CHARLIE'S SYMPTOMS</i>
<i> SHOULD DIMINISH</i>
<i> SO THAT LOVE WILL START</i>
<i> TO FEEL MORE LIKE THIS.</i>
<i> QUIET, WARM, STEADY</i>
<i> AND BEAUTIFUL.</i>
<i> AND THE BEST PART IS,</i>
<i> THEY'LL NEVER GET BORED</i>
<i> BECAUSE CHARLIE'S CONDITION</i>
<i> WILL NEVER COMPLETELY GO AWAY.</i>
<i> HE'LL ALWAYS BE</i>
<i> JUST CRAZY ENOUGH</i>
<i> TO KEEP THINGS</i>
<i> INTERESTING.</i>
