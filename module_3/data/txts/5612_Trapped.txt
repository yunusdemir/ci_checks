What's going on? What's
the police doing here?
Vikingur...
killed the Polish guy... Pawel.
This is how it looks:
Finnur was a homophobe who bullied
you when you were younger.
Finnur knew your father
was deep in debt.
He put pressure on him
to take over his land.
It pushed your dad
over the edge.
You killed Finnur
and tried to frame
the nationalists.
I didn't do it.
Sorry, I must ask you to leave.
Can you clean this up
before two o'clock?
We're expecting an
important visitor.
Jamal Al Othman from
American Aluminium.
They're financing the smelter.
Vikingur kills Finnur
and then he kills this guy. Why?
It must be connected.
They all work here.
There comes Pawel...
The power is cut off...
Then Vikingur arrives.
The electrical panel is
inside, right? -Yes.
Somebody else turned
off the electricity.
Here you go.
It's the amount we agreed on.
Asgeir.
Look.
- Is Hinrika pregnant?
- No kidding!
We're waiting for the
results of the blood tests.
There is something in his gut
but we don't know what it is.
I found them on the
heath, lying by the lake.
The lake is polluted.
My son, Skuli, drank
water from that lake.
There seems to be no end to the
misfortune of this little town.
For reasons still unknown
people have been warned
not to consume tap water until
test results are clear.
Look what's happening
around here.
This is a scandal. An outrage.
We build factories
that kill nature.
Destroy it. Destroy us.
Look.
Just look at that!
What does the government do?
And the politicians?
They build another factory, that
increases the pollution even more.
When will they wake up?
When will you all wake up.
Cause death is staring
you right in the eye.
We lay to rest a loving husband
and father, Finnur Grimsson.
From earth to earth,
ashes to ashes.
What about Vikingur?
We keep him for the
day, at least.
Even though the CCTV
footage is helpful,
it's not proof that the
person who cut the power off,
also killed the Polish guy.
But someone did switch
off the electricity.
We can't rule out he
had an accomplice
although it's far fetched
given the course of events.
I guess it makes sense.
If we wait, the killer
might be caught off guard.
And start making mistakes.
He already is.
Yes. Talk to you later.
Okay.
You're really something.
I needed coffee so bad, I was about
to turn into a serial killer.
A present for me?
I sent a bird and a samples
from the lake, to Reykjavik.
A packet, just like this one.
- Can't you beat them to it?
- Yes, I'm sure I can.
If your results will
be ready tonight...
I'll invite you for dinner.
I'm a fine cook.
It's a deal.
Hi.
I saw you spying on us
in the parking lot.
I have to ask you a
few more questions.
I just buried my husband.
It won't take long.
I can't offer you coffee,
there's no water.
Nice of him to come, the
man from the plant, David.
I saw him hand you something.
I didn't even know who he was.
But yes, he seemed decent.
- How much is this?
- Five hundred thousand kronas.
I'm just as surprised
as you are.
He wanted me to know that the
money came from his pocket.
- Did he say something else?
- Not really.
He wanted to know if Finnur
had ever mentioned him.
- And did he?
- No.
When I said no he seemed...
relieved.
- May I take this string?
- Why, yes.
- There's no water.
- We have milk and juice.
In the toilet. Never mind.
Do you really think
Vikingur killed my dad?
I can't really say. Sorry.
Thanks for your help.
I think you all should know
that my son's in a
hospital in Reykjavik.
He must have drank water
from the water up there.
The doctors have been
scratching their heads
but now the case is solved.
He drank poisoned water caused
by those bloody capitalists
who are enlarging the plant!
Let's not bring
politics into this.
- No, this is a curse.
- That's right.
The curse laid on old
Thorir and his family.
- Let's stick to facts.
- Do you think it's not a fact?
The man disappeared 35 years ago
and hasn't been seen since.
Isn't that a fact?
- Yes, but no cock-and-bull stories.
- Cock-and-bull stories?
The man built his farmhouse
on an enchanted rock
and that can mean a curse on
his family for centuries.
That is a fact.
I clearly remember
that he was warned,
but he didn't listen.
He was always
stubborn, Thorir was.
What does this have to do
with the polluted water?
It simply means
that the curse is spreading
over the whole town.
It started a few years
ago in disastrous events
if people choose to remember.
So just you tell me again
that there's no curse?
I read about the funeral
in the newspaper.
- You know how the press is.
- Are you back?
No, I'm still up north
wrapping up a few things.
I haven't heard from Jamal.
What about you?
No, I haven't seen him. I
have to go now, talk later.
Take care of yourself.
Here's your coffee.
- What's with the water?
- It's poisoned. Reason unknown.
We found lots of dead
fish on the heath.
Don't worry, it's not tap water.
We're not poisoning you.
It's much bigger that I thought.
Well, see you later.
Hinrika.
How are you doing?
Just fine.
What do you think is
causing the pollution?
- What do you mean?
- Do you think it's from the plant?
Yes, everyone knew this bloody
factory would cause damage.
- All right, thanks.
- Hinrika.
- Don't we need to talk?
- Later.
You have fucking cursed
the whole fucking area.
Fucking hell!
Boys! Boys!
Clear off my land you devils!
You can tell your wife
that her fairy son
can rot in fucking hell.
What the fuck are
you going to do?
Fuck off, you idiots!
Fuck you. Fucking poof!
What can you tell me about David...
from the plant?
- Do you know him?
- Not much.
Was he close with Finnur?
Do you know?
I know they sometimes play
poker with a few others.
Ok.
Hi, hi.
Hi.
Hi, Ebo.
- Was Pawel one of the poker players?
- Yes, I think so.
Just so you know...
Vikingur was not a
part of this group.
Ok.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Have we heard from Reykjavik
yet, about this poison tests?
No. Gudrun is also
working on it.
- How's Vikingur?
- Just fine.
Why haven't they picked him up?
The prosecutor has all the data.
What are they waiting for?
Everything points to him.
Step in here for a minute.
Look...
We think Vikingur is innocent.
I thought Andri had told you.
We saw some CCTV footage
last night which showed us
that Vikingur did not
cut the power off.
It happened just
before he arrived.
But we don't want to
leak this out just yet
because then the person who
killed Pawel and even Finnur
might start to feel sure of
himself and make mistakes.
We think Vikingur was framed.
- I didn't see this footage.
- I thought Andri had filled you in.
And Andri must have
thought I told you.
I'm sorry about the miscommunication.
-It's ok.
I'm just a country
cop with no ambition
- for murder cases and serious crime.
- I thought Andri had told you.
- He didn't need to.
- Don't play the martyr.
I get enough of that
from my husband.
I...
I didn't know you were pregnant.
What do you mean? Did
Bardur say that?
Well...
I...
I need to talk to you.
Close the door.
Who the hell do you
think you are?
- Rummaging through my drawer.
- I just needed space...
There's enough space out there.
Yes.
I apologize.
But sincere congratulations.
This is an old picture.
I had a miscarriage.
Do you know where
my green shirt is?
There's something I'd like
to talk to you about. -What?
What would you say
about us moving to Reykjavik?
I would sell the farm.
This wouldn't happen tomorrow
but there's no future for us
here after your dad died.
There was no future here anyway.
- So you would be fine with it?
- Are you joking? Yes.
Really?
- Asgeir.
- Yes.
- Where's Gudrun?
- In the storage room.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I met your friend, Ebo.
He's well cared for at
Hjortur and Soffia's.
I thought you might
want to know.
Gudrun.
Anything interesting
in Pawel's stuff?
Not really, mostly some junk.
Dirty clothes, undies, a poker set...
-Can I see that?
So he was serious
about his poker.
- Was that all?
- Yes.
- Andri... do you have a minute?
- Yes.
Sure. Thanks.
We're a team. A good team.
At least we used to be.
We have to be able
to communicate.
Why didn't you tell Asgeir about
the Vikingur plan? -Hinrika.
- I can speak for myself.
- I thought you told him.
I really thought she did.
But I'm just an arrogant prick
from Reykjavik. -No, come on.
I have some news.
This David, boss at the plant.
-Yes.
He gave Elin half
a million cash.
And this string was
tied around the wad.
A figure-eight knot like
the one on Finnur's noose.
Look who's here.
Hi.
My little sister's
been vomiting all day.
Ok.
- You know something about that?
- Isn't she just bumped up?
Or can't stand your face.
Maybe both. -Fuck you.
This is all your and
your family's fault.
Be friends, boys.
You hillbillies should stay home
with your fucking accordions.
So I am the hillbilly now?
Isn't it you who's fucking
your little sister?
Shut your dirty
mouth, you whore.
Stop this bloody nonsense
or I'll throw you out.
You too, girls.
Let's go.
Fuck you!
Aron, come on. I don't want
to deal with my dad just now.
Aron. Come on.
What...
Bloody hell.
I'm here to see my son.
- We can't allow that.
- I'm his mother.
- I must be allowed to see him.
- I'm sorry.
Let's talk, Steinunn.
Have a seat.
My relationship with my son
hasn't been at its best.
I just wanted him to know
that I'll always
be there for him.
We understand.
You know what's happening here.
People think my
family is responsible
for all bad things that
ever happened to them.
Suddenly we are responsible for all
the horror that's taking place.
We literally had shit
thrown at our house today.
House and windows. It will take
a while to clean up this filth.
- Do you know who they were?
- Of course.
I know their mothers.
I can even tell you what
day they were born.
I could even tell you
when each of them
had his first fight
with Vikingur.
But then realised that fighting
with him was a mistake.
- You want to press charges?
- God, no.
One of them,
the one who called him a poof...
his childhood friend.
I walked in on him and Vikingur
together when they were seventeen.
The truth is that Vikingur
got to know some of
those local boys
better than they would admit to.
- You have a daughter.
- Daughters, I have two.
- The one I met...
- Thorhildur.
If Thorhildur, for some reason,
would kill someone, you'd
stick with her, right?
You'd continue loving
her no matter what.
Please let me see him.
I just want to tell him
how much I love him.
Look... He's in custody.
And there's a huge pile of
evidence leading to him.
What I'm about to tell you,
you mustn't repeat to anyone.
- What do you mean?
- Promise?
Yes, I promise.
We have clues indicating
that he may be innocent.
I do stress we're still
investigating the case.
And he'll stay in custody
until we have it solved.
Yes.
But hopefully you'll
meet him in a few days.
It's good we're movin
g to the city.
The only livable place
in this country.
I'm sorry about my
stupidity yesterday.
I'm sorry I hung up on you.
- Did your dad take your phone?
- Yes.
I hate to say it, but I
almost understand him.
We should have told him
about the money sooner.
Maybe it's connected
with Dad's murder.
The murderer could even
be looking for us.
It all seems so crazy.
Is something wrong?
Promise not to get angry...
What?
There wasn't just
money in the bag.
I also found this.
She's his mother. I thought she
deserved to hear the truth.
I don't doubt that.
But I should have
talked to you first.
Yes, Andri, that would
have been better.
Do you have the results
from Reykjavik?
Not yet.
- Then I won our bet.
- Really?
The geese were poisoned
with E.coli and PCB
- Deadly poisonous.
- How did that get into the lake?
That's the question.
You said PCP?
No, PCB.
Poly-chlorinated-biphenyl.
Will you be cooking? You
said you were a fine cook.
Yes.
Absolutely.
My place around seven?
Yeah.
Sounds good.
Hello.
- Is my dad here?
- No, sorry.
Anything I can do?
What is it?
Thorhildur, dear. Don't worry.
It's ok.
You can tell me what's wrong.
She thinks her dad will
kill her when he sees this.
It would be great if you'd
ask him to be nice.
What is it? -She found this
mobile in the money bag
- at my place.
- Right.
You should check the messages.
Alright, kids. We'll
look into it.
What's that?
I'm not sure.
If you're looking for
water You'd better hurry.
- It's almost sold out.
- Thank you.
The worst is not over.
You know that.
How can we lift a curse
that's been laid upon us
- by life itself?
- What are you talking about?
One would think some kind
of sacrifice would suffice.
There is evil, evilness,
seething underneath in the
family you married into.
We haven't seen the
half of it yet.
Hi, Steinunn. Are you alright?
- What did the old witch say?
- Just some nonsense.
Daddy needs to talk to the lady.
What a tragedy with Vikingur.
It's so hard to believe. It's
like a never ending nightmare.
He's innocent.
Yes, of course he is.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Smoking again, are you?
- The pressure of being around you.
Take care.
- Hello, David.
- Hi.
We have to talk to you.
Can it wait? I have
a foreign guest.
No, it can't wait.
There's only one number.
One person messaging.
I'll read for you.
Where should I bring the money?
The barn.
I need to talk to you tonight.
I'll be at the barn.
Haven't you paid them yet?
I'm there; Hi; Aren't you
supposed to be dead?
Can we meet?
This could be the killer.
- Have you checked the number?
- It's off or not registered.
- You'll have to tell Andri.
- Of course.
This had better be important.
Do you realize you could
have screwed up the project?
Many people rely on
it, you know that.
If this investor has
second thoughts
it's not because you had
to take a short break.
You used a figure-eight knot around
the gift to Elin, the widow.
What has that to
do with anything?
An interesting knot.
I didn't want to tie a bow.
Where did you learn to tie the knot?
-In the boy scouts.
Is this the reason for our talk?
Why did you give
the money to Elin?
Because she needed it.
- Half a million.
- Yes, she lost her husband.
- So you're the generous type.
- Obviously.
Damn, I'm getting late.
You play poker, don't you?
Yes, sometimes I play poker.
Did you play with
Finnur and Pawel?
- Yes, I've played with them.
- What about Vikingur?
No, never Vikingur.
Text message: "Meet me at
the kindergarden NOW".
It was a gambling
debt, wasn't it?
- Did you owe Finnur this money?
- Yes.
It's a matter of principle. I
wanted the widow to have it.
- Did you owe money to Pawel?
- What's that got to do with it?
Since it's a matter of principle
you might want his
widow's address.
Am I a suspect?
Andri.
Text message: "Yes,
I'll be there".
You had motive, owing
money to both men.
Come on. I haven't
killed anyone.
I would hardly have given the widow
money if I had killed the man.
Where were you the night
Finnur was killed?
Friday evening October 12th.
I was in Akureyri.
Went for dinner
with a lady friend.
Me and Yrsa Benediktsdottir,
Member of Parliament.
Would you like to call her?
I have her number if
you want to verify it.
Between eleven and one?
Yes, well...
I...
We spent the night together.
That's confidential.
Flight IA 404 is
ready for departure.
Passengers please board
at gate number 1.
Maybe we should focus
on the polluted water.
Do you think it's connected?
They say that the pollution
stems from the plant.
- Who says?
- Ketill... Bardur...
So the murders are connected
with the pollution?
The murders seem to be
connected to the plant
so maybe it's worth
checking it out.
Text message: "I've arrived".
Hello!
Hey!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Where's Asgeir?
- Gone.
- Where to?
- Home I guess.
- Didn't he call you?
- Yes, but I couldn't take the call.
He said he'd call you.
He got a lead.
- What lead?
- Your daughter brought a phone.
- A phone?
- She found it in the money bag.
She was texting with someone,
Asgeir thought it
could be the killer.
- What? Where's this phone?
- I looked but didn't find it.
I told him to call you.
He hung up.
I'll try the radio.
Hinrika calling Asgeir.
- When was this?
- An hour ago, maybe.
I'll try Bardur.
Car 247, report to station.
Hinrika calling Asgeir.
Hey! Stop!
