Good morning.
Good morning.
Wave those flags, son!
Get out of there!
Hit them again!
Get out of here!
Get out of them trees, damn it!
Get them!
Migrate south, will you?
Mama!
Mama!
-Three more radios for you, Shelby.
-Not now, Tommy. Mama!
This nail polish is drying
way too dark.
Practically Pink, my foot. Looks
like a stuck pig bled all over my hand.
lm sure l have something
that will do.
Oh, no!
lt has to be delicate.
lf l dont have something, your brother
will go get some delicate pink polish.
-Mom--
-Jonathan, just a minute.
Great. ld love to see
what the boys would pick out.
Delivery man! Someone stop
that truck! Stop that--
Dont put ice down my back!
You shouldve drowned them at birth.
Shelby.
-See if you can get this.
-My nails are wet.
Shelby!
Maam?
Would you look at those, please?
Dad, over here! Behind the tent!
Come on!
Myrtle, hi.
Hold on, please.
lm gonna get you!
Drum!
Sweetheart, lm on the phone.
Stop that now!
l cant hear myself think!
Myrtle, the champagne glasses,
theyre all broken.
Help!
Spud!
Spud, turn off that stupid television.
Get in here and finish dyeing
these Easter eggs.
l ran out of stuff.
Well, thats why God
invented the A P.
-Gotta work on the truck.
-No, you gotta get the lead out.
Yes, maam. l live to serve.
lf those eggs are not at the church
by noon, they dont get hidden.
Are you listening to me, Spud?
Mrs. Jones?
Are you Annelle?
You sweet thing, come on.
Excuse me.
Pick up my green dress
at the cleaners!
Am l interrupting something?
No, lm just screaming at my
husband. l can do that anytime.
Please, call me Truvy.
Thank you.
Mama, look at this.
This was in the hall closet.
What is it?
Rubbers.
Tommy says Jonathans planning to cover
the honeymoon car with these.
-Please stop him!
-Keep your voice down.
Jonathan!
Boys, l wanna talk to you.
Tommy! Jonathan! Tommy!
Jonathan, dont you decorate
your sisters car with condoms!
lts tacky!
lts like talking to a brick wall.
lf hes trying to drive me crazy,
its too late.
There must be a better way
to get rid of those birds.
We could cut down all our trees...
...or change the migratory patterns
of the birds. Take your pick.
You told him to get rid of them.
l had no idea he would alienate
the entire neighbourhood.
ltd be a lot more alienated...
...if they got covered
in bird shit at my reception.
Pretty talk!
Do you have to be so crude?
There.
l see a hole.
l was hoping youd catch that.
lts a little bit pouffier than l
would normally do, but lm nervous.
lm not worried about that.
l usually wrap my entire head
in toilet paper when l go to bed...
...so it usually gets pretty shmushed
down in that process anyway.
At the trade school, l was number one
when it came to frosting and streaking.
l did my own.
Really?
Thats good.
And l can usually spot a bottle job
at 20 paces.
-Your technique is really good.
-Thanks.
l think your form and content
will improve with time.
So, best l can tell, young lady,
youve just landed yourself a job.
Oh, God!
Thank you!
Thank you, Miss Truvy.
No time for thanks. Well be busier
than a one-armed paperhanger.
Here, let me help you.
lts all right. l got it.
You got tiny little hairs
and fuzzies all over you.
Theres so much static electricity
in this room...
...l pick up everything
but boys and money.
Louie!
Louie, hold up!
l want you to meet Annelle.
Shes taking Judys place.
Swell.
Louie, take out the garbage!
Cant.
Late.
Whatd you hire her for?
Our son.
Were so proud of him.
Annelle, honey, what do you say
we talk some trash?
lm so excited.
l cant believe its happening.
lm a beautician!
Glamour technician.
Glamour technician.
lll have you know, you are
working in the most successful shop...
...in this town.
Because l have a strict philosophy
that l have stuck to for 1 5 years.
There is no such thing
as natural beauty.
There is no such thing
as natural beauty.
You remember that,
or were all out of a job.
Just look at me. lt takes
some effort to look like this.
l can see that.
So how long have you been in town?
A few weeks.
New in town.
lt must be exciting
being in a new place.
l wouldnt know.
lve lived here all my life.
Well, tell me things about yourself.
Theres nothing to tell.
l live here. lve got a job now.
Thats it.
How about a few of these issues
of Southern Hair?
Sure, take them.
lt is essential to stay abreast
of the latest styles.
And lm glad to see your interest.
You must live close by. At least in
walking distance. l didnt see a car.
l dont have a car.
l been staying across the river
at Robelines boarding house.
Thats quite a walk.
Ruth Robeline.
Now, there is a story for you.
She is a troubled, twisted soul.
Her whole life has been
an experiment in terror.
Her husband got killed
in World War ll.
Then her son got killed in Vietnam.
When it comes to suffering, she is
right up there with Elizabeth Taylor.
l had no idea.
Hello!
-Clairee!
-Good morning. Good morning!
ld like to introduce you to
the former first lady of Chinquapin...
...Miss Belcher.
ld like you to meet Annelle.
lm a little embarrassed.
lm windblown.
lve just been to the dedication
of the childrens park.
How did that go?
Beautifully.
Except....
Janice van Meter got hit
with a baseball. lt was fabulous.
Was she hurt?
l doubt it. She got hit in the head.
Janice van Meter is the current
mayors wife. We hate her.
They named the new park
after Clairees late husband.
This town is so proud of her.
Thats nice.
Whats your family name, dear?
My married name is Dupuy...
...but lm originally from Zwolle.
How nice.
Theres towels in the dryer.
Would you fold them and bring them in?
-Sure.
-Thank you.
Sweet gal. Whered you find her?
Yesterday, when Judy quit...
...l called up the trade school
and told them to send me a warm body.
And Annelle was the valedictorian
of the hairdo class.
And l think theres a story there.
What makes you say that?
For starters, shes married...
...but shes living over
at Ruth Robelines alone.
ld get to the bottom of this
if l were you.
You have some silverware
youd like to keep.
lm not worried about that.
Shes just as sweet as she can be.
And, besides, l kind of like the idea
of hiring somebody with a past.
She cant be more than 1 8.
She hasnt had time to have a past.
Get with it, Clairee.
This is the 80s. lf you can achieve
puberty, you can achieve a past.
That man!
l swear, l dont know how MLynn
puts up with that.
Go on, get out of here!
Jackson, please.
lm gonna talk some sense into you.
lts bad luck to see me
before the wedding.
So you are gonna marry me.
Come on, now, we can work this out.
Shelby, please.
You know you wont go
through with this.
You dont have to give back
all the wedding presents.
That VCR alone is worth
getting married for.
And l love you.
lf my daddy catches you here...
...the question of whether or not
l can have your children wont matter.
He will cut your thing off.
Say youre gonna marry me.
l hate suspense.
You meet me 2:00,
Presbyterian Church.
lll be the one in the veil,
down front.
lm gonna make you very happy.
Well see.
Give me the sports.
Boys...
...were off to Truvys. Jonathan,
keep your eye on your brother, Tommy.
-Am l my brothers keeper?
-Youre your brothers warden.
And that horrible womans coming by to
deliver the grooms cake in about an--
Wheres your father?
His coffee kicked in.
Shelby, lets go.
lm coming, Mama.
l said ld be right there.
Youre gonna be late
for your own wedding.
lm wearing my hair down
because Jackson likes my hair down.
The veil would be prettier
with your hair up.
Get over it, Mama.
Oh, God! Come here! Stop it, Rhett!
Oh, shit!
-lts Miss Ouiser.
-Back door.
Drum!
Come here.
MLynn!
Open the door!
l know youre in there!
l think theres somebody at the door.
l think its for Daddy.
l know youre in there!
Say,  Please.
Thank you.
Get over there, Rhett!
Stop pulling!
Sit! Rhett!
Sit! Sit!
Ouiser, you look like hammered shit.
Dont you talk to me like that!
lm sorry.
You look like regular shit.
l have such a bone to pick with you.
Stop egging him on.
Come here.
l have just come from the vet.
Come here, Rhett.
Whitey Black says that
all this noise...
...youve been making around here
for the last few days...
...has been causing a nervous
condition in my dog.
Look at this.
All his hairs falling out.
l gotta give this animal
tranquillizers.
Whitey Black is a moron. lm not
even sure he has opposable thumbs.
lf youll excuse me, lve got
a little work out in the back yard.
Hi, Miss Ouiser.
Leave me alone.
Now, you listen to me.
l dont know if lm coming or going.
l heard you got so screwed up,
you cut your dog out of your will...
...and had an ungrateful nephew
put to sleep.
lm about at the end of my rope.
Well, tie a noose in it
and slip it over your head.
Damn it, Ouiser.
l dont wanna kill you.
Boys, bring me my gun!
Dont you threaten me, Drum Eatenton,
or l will call the police.
l gotta scare away about 5 zillion
birds before Shelbys reception.
lf l dont, lll have to deal
with my wife.
l make it a point never
to deal with my wife.
That dog is on his last legs.
Whatll l do with him?
Serve him on toast.
Did you get those magnolias
out of my tree?
The judge has not decided
whose tree that is exactly.
lt is mine.
l will speak to MLynn about this.
Now, are these chocolate
chips semisweet or milk?
Theyre milk.
ls the Karo syrup light or dark?
lts a matter of taste.
Wheres the other one you were
talking about?  Cuppa, Cuppa, Cuppa.
Thats simple. You dont need
to write it down.
Thats a cup of flour, a cup of sugar,
a cup of fruit cocktail with the juice.
Then you mix and bake at 350
until gold and bubbly.
-Sounds awfully rich.
-lt is.
So l serve it over ice cream
to cut the sweetness.
lll be right back, honey.
MLynn, it looks like
youre ready to roll.
And l think we can trust
Annelle here to do that.
Her coiffure cards
in a little box on the counter.
l dont know.
Today is a very special day.
My work is too pouffy
when lm nervous.
Stop that!
Youre a professional now...
...so just get over there
and bang some hair.
Does your dress have to go
over your head?
No.
Good.
-lm sorry.
-Relax.
You cant screw up her hair.
Just tease it and make it look
like a brown football helmet.
l must have missed the passage
in Emily Post that said:
All abuse is heaped
on the mother of the bride.
Hush, girls.
Your mama never tells us much.
Whats Jackson like?
Hes really cute.
l thought he was a pest at first, but
he kind of grew on me. Now l love him.
You made a very good catch, Shelby.
Louisiana lawyers do well,
whether they want to or not.
l dont really care.
Dont get me wrong.
The money is real nice and all.
But l just like the idea
of growing old with somebody.
My dream is to sit on the porch,
covered with grandchildren, saying:
No! and Stop that!
Will you quit your nursing job?
Never! l love it.
l love being around all those babies.
Drum and l both feel that she should
not work after she gets married.
lm so anxious to discuss this topic
for the 900th time this week.
You shouldnt be on your feet all day.
Be kind to your circulatory system.
You know what you need in here, Truvy?
You need a radio.
Music is a wonderful thing
in the background.
lt takes the pressure off everybody
feeling they have to talk so much.
l used to have one, but l
slammed it against the wall...
...when l couldnt figure out
where the batteries went.
Of course, l know now l was suffering
from premenstrual syndrome.
Radio? What did l just hear--?
Oh, yes.
The Antilley family is selling KPPD.
l wonder how much radio stations
sell for.
Miss Clairee.
You should buy KPPD.
You got plenty of money.
What would l do with a radio station?
Business never interested me.
Lloyd took care of that stuff.
l hope you and Jackson will be
as happy as Lloyd and l were.
We had such a good time.
Until November.
At least he hung on through
the state playoffs.
Miss Clairee, there are still
good times to be had.
l really do love football.
But its hard to parlay that
into a reason to live.
What are your colours, Shelby?
Theyre  blush and  bashful.
Her colours are  pink and  pink.
My colours are blush and bashful, Mama.
How precious is this wedding
gonna get, l ask you?
My colours are blush and bashful.
l have chosen two shades of pink.
One is much deeper than the other.
But the bridesmaids dresses,
they are really beautiful.
Ceremony will be too.
The walls are banked with sprays
of flowers in my two shades...
...of blush and bashful.
Pink carpets specially laid out for
my service, and pink silk bunting...
...draped over anything
that would stand still.
lt looks like its been
hosed down with Pepto-Bismol.
l like pink. Pink is
my signature colour.
How many bridesmaids?
-Nine.
-Nine? Good Lord.
Exactly. Mama made me have my cousins
and Margie St. Maurice.
Lets not go into this now.
You know there was no way around it.
lt will be pretentious.
Daddy says, An ounce of pretension
is worth a pound of manure.
The poet laureate of Dogwood Lane.
Mama, l wish youd get off
Daddys back.
-l dont wanna get into--
-Fill us in on the reception.
My reception! My reception!
Ferns, dancing, tons of people! Every
pink flower west of the Mississippi.
Wedding cake in the dining room
and the grooms cake....
Hidden in the carport?
Shelby and l, we agree on one thing.
The grooms cake.
lts awful.
lts in the shape
of a giant armadillo.
An armadillo? Youre joking, right?
No. Jackson wanted a cake in the shape
of an armadillo. His aunt makes them.
lts unusual.
lts repulsive.
lts got grey icing.
l cant even begin to think
how youd make grey icing.
Worse, the cake part is
red velvet cake. Blood red.
People will hack into this poor animal
that looks like its bleeding to death.
The rehearsal supper was
a real experience.
Mama, it wasnt that bad.
lt was out at Jacksons
uncles place on the river.
He comes from a good
old Southern family...
...with good old Southern values.
You shoot it, stuff it or marry it.
Theyre simply outdoorsy, thats all.
Did yall do anything
especially romantic?
We drove down to Frenchmens Point
and went parking.
Oh, Shelby. Really!
MLynn, leave her alone.
This is my favourite part.
This is the romantic part. See,
thats what really melts my butter.
Then we went skinny dipping, and we did
things that frightened the fish.
lts been a long time since weve had
a youngster in this place.
We talked and talked and talked....
l love those kind of talks
in the arms of the man you love.
Actually, we fought most of the time.
You fought?
l told him l wouldnt marry him.
What?
Whyd you go do a thing like that?
lts okay now. We worked it all out.
lts probably just one of those
last-minute jitter things.
No, but the weddings still on.
Well, thank goodness.
Because this is going
in the Hairdo Hall of Fame.
Shelby, you scared us. That wasnt
a nice thing to do to your mama.
Never say that to a woman whos
marinating 50 pounds of crab claws.
But the making up can be so romantic.
l miss romance so much.
Truvy, it cant be that bad.
Oh, really, now?
The last romantic thing my husband
did for me was back in 1 97 2.
He enclosed this carport
so l could support him.
l think l have something
that could cheer you up.
Drum and l plan to talk to your husband
about adding on to our house.
MLynn, are you serious?
lf you give Spud a job,
lll give you hot oil treatments...
...for the rest of your life!
Annelle, this looks pretty good.
l think you know what youre doing.
Thank you.
Mrs. Eatenton, you have great hair.
-Your scalps as clean as a whistle.
-l try.
lt must run in the family.
This younguns got the prettiest hair
lve ever had my hands in. So thick.
Just because lm bragging on you
dont mean you can get lazy on me.
Stop it.
Shelby?
Shelby! MLynn!
lll get some juice.
Theres some candy in my purse.
l have some right here.
Shelby. Shelby.
Hold on. Clairees
getting you some juice.
-Should l get her a cookie?
-No.
Juice is better.
Heres the juice.
You need some juice.
You need some juice.
-Stop it, Mama.
-Drink the juice.
-Please drink the juice.
-No!
Stop it! l have
some candy in my purse.
You didnt bring your purse.
You didnt bring your purse.
No, you didnt.
No, here you go. There you go.
Drink some of this.
lts not any wonder...
...with all this running around
and wedding nonsense.
Excuse me. Should l call
the doctor or something?
Shes a diabetic.
She just has a little too much
insulin, thats all.
Well get a little more in her.
Shell be all right.
lf you dont leave me alone,
lm gonna leave.
ld love to see you try.
Cooperate, please.
Honey, drink. Please.
Come on, now. Thattagirl.
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
There you go. There you go.
There, there. Thats a start.
This one hit her fast.
Shes been so upset lately.
Dr. Mitchell told her
on her last appointment...
...children arent possible.
Dont talk about me like lm not here.
Shes making some sense now.
Yes, she is.
This one was not bad at all.
lt was not bad at all.
l think we need
a little more juice.
Could l do something to help?
No, no.
Shell be fine.
Dont fuss over her.
Normalitys very important to Shelby.
-Here, MLynn.
-Thanks.
lm really sorry about
the children part, MLynn.
l know.
Shes afraid Jackson will be throwing
away his chance to have children.
Jackson said:
Shelby, dont be stupid.
Theres plenty of kids out there
need good homes.
Drink some.
Well adopt 1 0 of them.
Well buy them if we have to.
Jackson sounds like good people to me.
-Mama, lm sorry.
-Thats all right, honey.
lts all right.
lts all over now. lts all--
You hold your juice.
lts all over.
Hold your juice, all right?
You all right?
-Truvy, lm sorry.
-lll fix it.
Well fix it.
-What did l do with my gun?
-Whered you leave it?
How the hell do l know?
Come on, we have work to do.
Daylights burning.
Were gonna get rid of some birds!
-Got the arrows, Daddy.
-All right.
Look here. Look here.
-l got the targets.
-Were not going target shooting.
Miss Clairee, what cute shoes!
You think so?
lm not so sure myself.
They seem a little too racy for me.
lll probably give them away.
Theyre just too cha-cha for words.
lf you decide to get rid of them,
lll buy them.
What size you wear?
ln a good shoe, l wear a size 6.
But a 7 feels so good, l buy a size 8.
-Theyre 8 1 /2.
-Perfect.
Lord, give us strength!
Come here, Rhett!
That is one ugly dog.
What kind of dog is that?
lf it had hair,
itd be a Saint Bernard.
This is it. l have found it.
l am in hell.
Good morning, Ouiser.
Dont try to get on my good side,
Truvy. l no longer have one.
-Come here, Rhett.
-Youre a little early.
That is precisely why lm here. lve
gotta talk to MLynn about her husband.
He is a boil on the butt of humanity.
lm sorry. This whole thing
has gotten out of hand.
lts not your fault, MLynn.
l used to think you were crazy
for marrying that man.
Then l thought you
were a glutton for punishment.
Now l realize you must be
on some mission from God.
Daddy isnt trying to drive you crazy.
Hes trying to make my reception nice.
His hearts in the right place.
Ouiser, l know for a fact there
will be no more gunshots.
But he was gonna fire a gun at me.
Theyre blanks. Drum would never,
ever point a gun at a lady.
Hes a real gentleman.
l bet he takes the dishes out
of the sink before he pees in it.
Who the hell are you?
-Ouiser, this is my new--
-Fine.
Now, l know everybody in this town.
And l dont recall
having seen you before.
l just moved into town
not too long ago.
With your family?
l dont have any family.
Your husband?
My husband?
Yes.
Thats kind of hard to say.
l dont know.
You dont know?
Well, lm not sure.
Youre not sure?
lm intrigued. Are you married or not?
These are not difficult questions.
l cant talk about it.
Of course you can.
Well, lm not sure if lm married
or not. Hes gone.
Men are the most horrible creatures,
honey. They will ruin your life.
Everything is horrible.
Bunkie, thats my husband,
he just vanished last week.
He took all the money,
my jewellery, the car.
Most of my clothes were in the trunk.
Hes in big trouble with the law.
Drugs or something.
The police keep questioning me,
but l dont know anything.
They say that our marriage
may not be legal.
l wish youd have said something.
l was scared to.
l need a job in the worst way.
l didnt know if youd hire someone
who may or may not be married...
...to someone who might be
a dangerous criminal.
But, Miss Truvy, l swear to you
that my personal tragedy...
...will not interfere with
my ability to do good hair.
Of course it wont.
l dont think things
could get any worse.
Of course they can.
We are awful.
We are all hateful, awful people.
Here, all weve been talking about
is weddings and psychotic animals.
What can we do to help?
l know one thing l can do.
Today youll drop by my house
and have some bleeding armadillo cake.
Oh, yes, you must.
l couldnt.
l still get real emotional sometimes.
Not today, you wont. lt is going
to be a great party.
l dont have anything to wear.
No problem. l bet l have something
thatll do. lll call the house.
Thanks.
All right.
Load me up.
Ready?
All right.
Ready.
All right.
Are you ready?
Stand back. Here we go!
What the hell is that?
Got them right between the legs!
All right, you nailed them!
l hope no one was hurt.
Shelby, get my things.
Miss Ouiser, that dog
will eat Daddy alive!
Ouiser, talk to your dog!
Hell listen to you!
-lts my wedding day!
-Say something to your dog!
Kill, Rhett! Kill!
Daddy, what happened?
Bite him in the balls!
Sorry.
lm sorry.
Now.
Shelby.
Shelby, its time.
Daddy.
lts time.
Daddy, its time.
-lts time!
-lts time?
Who gives this woman in marriage?
Her mother and l do.
Dearly beloved....
This has been the happiest day
of my life, Daddy.
lm glad, sugar.
lm not talking too loud, am l?
No, youre fine.
Shelby loves you very much.
l hope so.
Cost me 60 bucks to rent this sucker.
lm being serious.
So am l.
l got the receipt right here.
Could l say this, please?
Shelby is so happy.
l know when youre young...
...it seems like everything will always
be perfect. Maybe it will be.
Promise to think about it before you
make any big decisions about family.
l know what youre saying.
Good.
What can l get you?
Nothing. No, thanks.
You sure? lts free.
Come on, whatll it be?
A cherry Coke.
Sure.
So are you a friend of the bride
or the groom?
Neither.
Shelby invited me.
l dont know why lm here.
lm Sammy.
This is the best cherry Coke
in the history of the world.
Can l help you, sir?
That Jackson...
...he is one big hanging man.
Yes, l know.
Nancy Beth, come along.
Calories, calories.
Calories, calories.
l dont like Belle Marmillion.
l dont trust anybody that does
their own hair. Thats not normal.
Shes our best volunteer
at the Mental Guidance Centre.
Shes so good with troubled children.
Wish l had taken Louie there
when he was little.
l shouldve known he had problems...
...when his imaginary playmates
wouldnt play with him.
Your boy grew up fine.
Hes just a little scary, thats all.
l think itd be fun to have access to
all that secret, personal information.
Come on, MLynn. Wont you tell me
some of your most bizarre cases?
Let me see if l can
figure out who they are.
Theres some pretty sick tickets
in this town.
lll do no such thing.
Cut that out.
You old fuddy-duddy.
lm not speaking to you.
What a shame.
l mean it, Drum.
Can we call a truce long enough
for me to get a piece of cake?
Thanks.
Nothing like a good piece of ass.
ld rather walk on my lips
than to criticize anybody.
But...
...Janice van Meter....
l know.
lll bet you money she paid $500
for that dress...
...and dont even bother
to wear a girdle.
Looks like two pigs fighting
under a blanket.
l havent left the house without Lycra
on these thighs since l was 1 4.
You were brought up right.
Congratulations, Drum.
Fantastic party.
Ouiser, theres someone
ld like you to meet.
That looks like an autopsy.
This is Jacksons
Aunt Fern Thornton...
...from Alexandria.
She made the cake.
You did this?
Guilty.
But its very simple, really.
lt just takes patience.
You only do armadillos?
No, l can do anything.
Except snakes.
l dont have the counter space.
Mama.
Help me.
Well, this is it.
Youre finally rid of me.
l think youll be back
every now and then.
Corsages are pretty stupid
when you think about it, arent they?
You make Jackson Latcherie
take good care of you.
Mama, Jackson will take care of me.
And lll take care of him.
And lm not stupid.
lll get my bags.
Well, the boys just brought
the car around.
What did they do to it?
Let me put it this way.
lf you and Jackson want
to practice safe sex...
...youre all set.
Truvy, are you leaving so early?
lll have some sweet dreams
with this under my pillow.
Tell your husband l hope
he feels better.
Hes gonna be fine.
-Say hello to Spud.
-lll do it.
lm sure hes sorry he missed all this.
lt was a beautiful wedding.
-Thanks, Truvy.
-Thanks a lot. Bye.
You leaving so soon?
Hi.
Hello.
Would you like a ride?
l have new shoes.
l have to break them in.
-Good night.
-Keep her away from me.
Stop it.
Walk me home, Clairee.
You just live over there.
l dont wanna walk
in that house by myself.
You watch the evening news. You know
what kind of world were living in.
-Walk me home.
-Whos gonna walk me home?
Youve got the flashlight.
-My cars parked over there.
-Come on, l wanna--
This is ridiculous! Youre only
a few feet away from here.
Follow me.
Youre acting like a child. The older
you get, the sillier you get.
And the older you get,
the uglier you get.
And last, but never least,
Santas most beautiful helper...
...this years Miss Merry Christmas,
Nancy Beth Marmillion!
Get it while the gettings good!
Best food in Louisiana!
Blood, sweat and tears go in every
little bowlful. Right, boys?
Thats right, Truvy.
One, two, three, four.
Shelby!
Get your little country
butt over here.
Were you trying to sneak by us without
buying some of our jumbo shrimp?
Theyre hot and spicy,
just like Annelle.
Stop!
Try one. Weve already pulled
their little heads off them.
lm just killing time. Jacksons found
a firearm. We may never see him again.
How about some iced tea?
lts the house wine of the South.
-Perfect.
-Oh, coming up.
Your mamas happy you got
home in time for the festival.
l wouldnt miss the festival for
the world. Hows your family?
Fine. Spuds as outgoing as ever.
Louie brought his girlfriend home.
The nicest thing l can say about her...
...is all her tattoos
are spelled correctly.
Truvy!
-Get your money away.
-Thanks.
My hairs not the only thing thats
changed. So much has happened.
After they finally put Bunkie Dupuy
behind bars and l was rid of him...
...l went wild. l was running around,
drinking, smoking--
Jezebel!
Truvy helped me see the error of my
ways. She gave me a place to live.
l go to church. lve done guest
lectures on beauty at the trade school.
Our little Annelle here has become
one of the hottest tickets in town.
lts true.
l am enjoying the city more, and lm so
excited about this Christmas festival.
Theres a Messiah sing-along tomorrow.
-Whats the matter?
-Nobody move! Nobody move!
My contact!
-Stay back. Stay back.
-Dont move!
Can you back up, please?
Hello, darlings!
When did you get into town?
This afternoon.
Here. Merry Christmas.
lm showing Jackson everything.
Hes never been to the festival.
Make sure you listen
to the football game tonight.
What are we listening for?
Me. lm a working gal now.
Didnt your mama tell you?
Mama never tells anyone anything.
lm the colour announcer
for the Devils. lm fabulous.
lm just too colourful for words.
Nice of them to let you
on the radio.
Nice, nothing.
l own the radio station.
-You bought it?
-Yes.
KPPD...
...the station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish.
Mrs. Belcher, weve gotta go!
-Bye!
-Kickoff!
Well?
Rolly Bassett got the contract.
His bid was 6000 under mine.
Six thousand?
He owns all his own equipment
and l dont.
lts hell to be poor and hired out.
l have got some fried chicken here,
prepared by Christian women...
...a bottle of cheap wine...
...and lve arranged for some
pretty incredible fireworks.
Come on, Spud.
l dont wanna miss the Nativity made
entirely out of sparklers.
-l dont feel much like it.
-You will once we get there.
lm happy where l am.
We always watch the fireworks.
This is KPPD radio...
...station of choice
in Chinquapin Parish...
...coming to you live
from the Devils locker room.
This is Bark Boone
with colour announcer Clairee Belcher.
Thank you, Bark.
You know, its a shame
our listeners cant be here...
...to see the gorgeous
new Devil uniforms.
Theyre lovely.
l myself would never have chosen
those white pants.
l wouldve gone with a darker colour.
White shows everything.
Just look at those grass stains.
lmpossible to get out.
lts hard to keep white clean
when youre tackled.
But l love the tops.
Such a vibrant purple.
Bark, would you call this colour
grape or aubergine?
Shut up!
What?
Youre making a fool out of yourself.
l am not!
This is football.
All people wanna hear about
is touchdowns and injuries.
They dont give a damn
about that grape shit.
We have a new psychiatrist
that comes in two days a week.
Of course, l pick her name
out of the grab bag.
lve gotta get something for her.
Would you put that on the list?
l have no idea
what to get your father.
Whats Jackson giving you?
Do you know?
Furniture.
Furniture? Well, my!
Must be nice to be married
to a rich lawyer.
For the living room?
No, for the nursery.
We wanted to tell you when you and
Daddy were together, but you never are.
lts every man for himself.
lm pregnant.
l realize that.
ls that it?
ls that all youre gonna say?
What do you want me to say?
Something along the lines of
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Would it be too much to ask...
...for a little excitement?
Not too much. l wouldnt want you
to break a sweat or anything.
lts in July.
You have to help me plan.
Were gonna get a new house.
Jackson and l are going
house hunting next week.
He loves to hunt for anything.
-What does Jackson say about all this?
-Hes so excited.
He says he doesnt care
whether its a boy or a girl...
...but l know he really wants
a son so bad he can taste it.
Hes cute about it.
lts all he talks about.
Jackson Latcherie, Jr.
Does he ever listen?
When doctors and specialists
give you advice...
...does he listen?
l know you never do. Does he?
What?
l guess since he doesnt have to carry
the baby, it isnt any of his concern.
l want a child.
What about adoption?
You filled out applications.
No judge is going to give a baby
to someone with my medical record.
Jackson put out feelers
about buying one.
People do it all the time.
Listen to me.
l want a child of my own.
l think it would help things a lot.
l see.
You worry too much.
l never worry, because l always know
youre worried enough for both of us.
Jackson and l gave this
a lot of thought.
-Theres a first time for everything.
-Dont start on Jackson.
Your body has been through so much.
Why would you do this to yourself?
-Diabetics have healthy babies.
-You are special, Shelby.
There are limits to what you can do.
l am going to be...
...very, very careful.
Nobodys gonna be hurt
or disappointed...
...or even inconvenienced.
Least of all Jackson, lm sure.
Youre jealous.
You no longer have
a say-so in what l do...
...and that drives you up the wall.
Youre ready to spit nails
because you cant call the shots.
l did not raise my daughter
to talk to me like this.
-Yes, you did.
-No, l didnt.
Whenever we asked what you wanted
for us when we grew up, whatd you say?
lm not in the mood to play games.
Just tell me what you said.
What did you say?
The only thing l have ever said to you
is that l want you to be happy.
The one thing that would make me happy
is to have a baby.
lf l could adopt one, l would,
but l cant.
lm going to have a baby,
and l wish youd be happy too.
lll tell you what l wish.
l dont know what l wish.
l dont know why you have to make
everything so difficult.
l look at having this baby
as the opportunity of a lifetime.
Sure, there may be risk involved,
but thats true for anybody.
But you get through it
and life goes on.
When alls said and done,
therell be a piece of immortality...
...with Jacksons good looks
and my sense of style, l hope.
Please.
Please.
l need your support.
l would rather have 30 minutes
of wonderful...
...than a lifetime of nothing special.
lll hand it to you.
l dont wanna hit you.
-Okay, l got one hole left.
-Right.
Put the cords so they dont show.
ltll look tacky.
You told me about 40 times.
Did you do all this?
Guilty.
Truvy just turned over
the decoration responsibility to me.
l went to the fire sale at the Baptist
Bookstore in Shreveport last week.
They had mismatched manger scenes
at incredibly low prices.
l cleaned them out of baby Jesuses,
which l made into ornaments.
Ready to roll.
Shelby, would you do the honours?
-Here you are, Mrs. Latcherie.
-Thanks, Sammy.
Ready?
Annelle, its wonderful!
lt works!
How cute!
l think your elves have gone berserk.
Shelby! l wasnt expecting
to see you here today.
lm running a special.
lts called a  Christmas quickie.
lm beyond help. lve discovered
the early stages of crows feet.
Time marches on, and eventually you
realize its marching across your face.
-Stop it.
-Oh, no.
lts Miss Ouiser.
lm supposed to give her
a pedicure today.
l hate working on her feet.
lt couldve been worse.
She couldve wanted a bikini waxing.
-Lets not get graphic.
-Why not?
Miss Ouiser, l met
an old friend of yours.
Owen Jenkins.
Owen! Now, theres a blast
from the past.
You remember him?
He remembers you.
Of course. He had the longest
nose hair in the free world.
He doesnt now.
He hardly has any hair anywhere.
Owens been gone from Chinquapin
since God was a boy.
l forgot he existed.
He lives in Monroe
and goes to First Presbyterian.
He found out where l was from
and asked if l knew you.
He used to live in Ohio.
His wife just died recently,
and hes moved back down here.
Does this story have a point?
No, not really. He just
remembers you fondly, l think.
l cant imagine why.
He was not a bad fellow.
But l managed to run him off...
...and marry the first
of two deadbeats.
Maybe l could arrange for us all
to get together.
-Maybe not.
-Why not?
ln a few decades, l married the two
most worthless men in the universe...
...and proceeded to have the three most
ungrateful children ever conceived.
The only reason people are
nice to me...
...is because l have
more money than God.
lm not about to open
a new can of worms.
What?
lf this is how you feel,
it isnt healthy.
Maybe you should come down to the
Guidance Centre and talk to someone.
lm not crazy, MLynn.
lve just been in a very bad mood
for 40 years.
Merry Christmas.
Look at you. ls that new?
l made the dress
with my own two hands.
l just threw the rest of it together.
The only thing that separates us
from the animals...
...is our ability to accessorize.
Annelle, why are you so late?
Did you and Sammy get tangled up
in the tinsel?
Truvy, you kill me.
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.
-Merry Christmas to you.
-Oh, darling.
Your nephew Marshall is a little piece
of heaven right here on earth.
Theyre family and l love them,
but they do look like...
...theyve all been carved
out of cream cheese.
Clairee, lm surprised at you
talking about your kin that way.
As somebody always said:
lf you cant say anything nice
about anybody, come sit by me.
Thats a good one.
-Somebody wants to see you.
-Who?
lve opened the can of worms for you.
Hell.
Owen Jenkins.
Hello, Louisa. Remember me?
My God, you look different.
Have you shrunk?
You look terrific.
Youve hardly changed at all.
lm not as sweet as l used to be.
l cannot believe Shelby did that.
Owen.
After all these years.
lm not sure l can be
gracious under pressure.
Shelby does a lot of things
l cant believe.
Whats wrong with you these days?
You got a reindeer up your butt?
Everybody!
Tommy, get all these people outside.
Quiet down. l just want
a moment of your time, folks.
Today, my daughter...
...told me a big secret.
Now, dont worry, honey, lm not
gonna tell them youre pregnant.
lm just gonna tell them
lm gonna be a granddaddy.
Thats wonderful!
-Grandma!
-Congratulations!
Aint you excited?
Smile. lt increases your face value.
The doctors said
Shelby couldnt have children.
What do they know?
She showed them.
The doctors said she shouldnt have
children. Theres a difference.
This baby is not exactly great news.
To Jackson and Shelby.
l really wish l had some
words of wisdom, but l dont.
So why dont we just focus
on the joy of the situation?
ltll be fine.
Absolutely.
You know what they say:
That which does not kill us
makes us stronger.
Nothing pleases Shelby more
than proving me wrong.
And to my new grandbaby.
May he be as good-looking as l am.
Born on the third of July
He's a Yankee Doodle sweetheart
He's a Yankee Doodle boy
Yankee Doodle went to London
Just to ride a pony
He is a Yankee Doodle boy
Go ahead, blow it out.
Go ahead, blow it out.
-This is boring.
-You only have a first birthday once.
-Hes making a wish.
-l wish hed blow out the candle.
l cant stand this.
Dont you dare!
Come on, here we go.
One, two, three.
Happy birthday!
lll be back from Truvys in about
an hour. Anything you want?
l think lll come with you.
l wanna get my hair cut. Short.
And l want Truvy to do it.
lts easy to take care of.
ld love to be able to
run my fingers through it and go.
l think that would be precious.
l feel the need to make things
as simple as possible.
Let me go tell Jackson.
l just cant seem to find the wipes.
Theyre in my bag. ls he wet?
Hes muddy.
Clairee, finish about your nephew.
Get to the good stuff.
Well, l have to admit...
...Marshall did go about it
the wrong way.
He marched in...
...and without so much
as a hello, he said:
Mama and Daddy, l have
something to tell you.
l have a brain tumour.
l have three months to live.
Naturally, Drew and Belle
became hysterical.
Then he said:
Hey, folks, lm only kidding.
lm just gay.
That was his idea
of breaking the news gently?
Marshall was always very theatrical.
l wonder what Drew and Belle must be
feeling about this.
l dont know.
Theyve considered themselves...
...a model family for so long.
First Nancy Beth dethroned
from her Miss Merry Christmas title...
...because of that unfortunate
motel thing.
What motel thing?
l dont live here anymore, remember?
Nancy Beth was discovered in a local
motel with a high political official.
They were both high. Theyd been
smoking everything but their shoes.
Shes the first Miss Merry Christmas
to be caught...
...with her tinsel
down around her knees.
Speaking of drawers, hang on to yours!
Oh, gosh.
You dont like it.
l did what you asked me, didnt l?
Yes, you really did a beautiful job.
lts just that....
Sweetheart, dont.
Please dont cry or l will too.
l have a strict policy that nobody
cries alone in my presence.
l love it.
Lets do my nails.
This is a treat! Nobody around here
ever wants a manicure.
l dont think ld even know what
to charge for a full days beauty.
lm gonna need one too.
l am gonna paint my front door red
and change my name to Elizabeth Arden.
Amen.
Amen.
lm gonna need some more
cuticle oil.
-ls it still next to--?
-Second shelf.
-Was she praying?
-Yes.
-Why?
-Got me.
Maybe she was praying for Marshall
and Drew and Belle.
Maybe she was praying
because we were gossiping.
Maybe she was praying because
the elastic is shot in her pantyhose.
Who knows? She prays at
the drop of a hat these days.
How long has she been this way?
Since Mardi Gras.
She had a choice of going to a
Bible weekend with her Sunday school...
...or to New Orleans with me
and two other sinners.
Whats her boyfriend say?
Sammys so confused...
...he dont know to
scratch his watch or wind his butt.
He could deal with another man,
but hes having trouble...
...with the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.
Well, does Marshall have,
you know, friends?
We discussed that.
l asked him how he...
...met people.
ln my day, a mans demeanor told
which side his bread was buttered on.
But in this day and age, who knows?
l asked Marshall,  How can you tell?
And he said, All gay men
have track lighting.
And all gay men are named
Mark, Rick or Steve.
Be a soft-spoken dog!
Morning.
Whats so funny?
Clairees just been telling us
this true story of track lighting.
l love mine.
Highlights my new artwork.
Since when do you have track lighting?
About three weeks. lts in
the foyer up the staircase.
My grandsons idea.
l havent seen him in ages.
How is he?
Steves fine.
Oh, God.
Your hair is so short.
Youre almost chipper.
Why are you in such a good mood?
Did you run over a small child?
Tomatoes.
Dont give all these to me.
Somebodys gotta take them.
l try not to eat healthy food
if l can possibly help it.
The sooner my body gives out,
the better off lll be.
l cant get enough grease
into my diet.
Then why do you grow them?
Southern women are supposed to wear...
...funny-looking hats and ugly clothes
and grow vegetables in the dirt.
Dont ask me those questions.
l dont know why.
l dont make the rules.
Now, thats attractive, Ouiser.
Honey, what have you done to yourself?
lt doesnt hurt.
MLynn, have you seen this?
Yes, l have.
The doctors strengthening my veins.
Theyre in terrible shape.
My God!
lt looks like you been
driving nails up your arms.
What is going on?
Shall we tell them?
l guess we cant keep it
a secret any longer.
Shelby has been driving nails
up her arm.
lts my dialysis. lts no big thing.
Dont look at me like that. Having
Jack, Jr., strained my kidneys...
...and now theyre kaput, thats all.
The doctor said this would
probably happen.
Thats all?
Thats all, she says.
Do you do this dialysis forever?
Well, l could, l suppose.
But its not convenient
when keeping up with Jack, Jr.
So lll have a kidney transplant.
lll be fine.
-ls it that easy?
-Sure.
They do them all the time
in Shreveport.
They do. Our Sunday school class was
just praying for one the other day.
But the hard part is
finding a kidney, isnt it?
l saw something about it on TV.
Very dramatic.
Medical teams fly all over the place
taking hearts and kidneys...
...and who knows what else.
You know what impressed me?
-They carry the organs in beer coolers.
-Stop it!
Those doctors take out
their six-packs...
...throw in some dry ice
and a heart and get on a plane.
How long do you have to wait for one?
There are people on dialysis
that have waited for years.
That must be agony.
l suppose, but...
...lm lucky.
l dont have to wait anymore.
Mamas gonna give me
one of her kidneys.
When?
We check in tomorrow morning.
So you better get going on my nails.
-Annelle, lm dripping.
-lm sorry.
l shouldnt have said that.
Said what?
Back at Truvys.
l said ld be better off
when my body wears out.
l shouldnt have said that
in front of Shelby.
And l didnt mean that.
Ouiser, nobody pays
any attention to you.
But l feel bad, Clairee.
lm a terrible person.
No, youre not.
Youd give your dog a kidney
if he needed one.
This is just a gesture.
Were not feeding Drum
till the end of time.
Drum loves pork and beans.
He eats them with everything.
That explains a lot.
Youre supposed to soak
the red beans overnight.
But we dont have overnight.
l wanna take it to them before
they leave for the hospital.
Lets cook something else.
l already bought the stuff.
lts in the  Freezes Beautifully
section of my cookbook.
l wanna take something
that freezes beautifully.
Then well make red beans and rice.
Sammy Dwayne Desoto,
what is this in my Frigidaire?
Beer.
l dont care what you do
in your refrigerator...
...but you wont keep liquor in mine.
Annelle, for Christs sakes.
Who?
Christ.
Who did you say?
Christ, Christ, Christ.
Are you speaking of our Lord? ls that
whose name youre taking in vain?
Thats the one.
l am sorry, Sammy, but l wont
spend the next 50 years of my life...
...with someone who l wont
run into in the hereafter.
Annelle, goddamn it.
l think we should pray.
ld rather eat dirt.
Shelby says her half
of the operations easy.
l guess MLynns is terrible.
They basically have to saw her in half
to get the kidney out.
They do it on Circus of the Stars
all the time.
Dont joke about it, Spud.
l feel awful for them.
l guess the Eatentons are lucky.
They all know how much they mean
to each other.
Maybe lm jealous.
Hand me that socket wrench, would you?
-Which ones a socket wrench?
-The socket wrench.
This funny-looking thing?
Thank you.
Thats not funny.
Okay, no more transplant jokes.
Daddy doesnt like them.
Whose turn is it?
Mama, give me all your...
...internal organs.
l mean aces.
Dad, lm sorry.
lt just slipped out.
Go fish.
lll put this little one to bed.
-Mama, lll do it.
-No, no, let me.
After tomorrow, itll be a long time
before l can pick him up.
So much for the card game.
Movie!
Yes! Old and black-and-white.
Nothing dirty there.
l got it. A classic.
A Tale of Two Kidneys.
You think thats funny?
Thats not funny.
l overslept because l was
up late cooking.
lve gotta get these beans
to the Eatentons...
...and its my Sunday
to count the offering...
...and l just know
lm gonna miss church.
Cool down. lm gonna have to
turn the hose on you.
l just dont know what lll do.
l know what youre gonna do.
You are gonna get in this car...
...and were gonna drop that pot
of beans off at the Eatenton house.
Then you are going to church with me.
l dont know.
Honey, God dont care which church
you go to, as long as you show up.
-Ouiser, what brings you here?
-Shut up.
l was just wondering how things were
with you and Owen.
l can report that the Sherwood Florist
delivery truck...
...stops by her house
at least twice a week.
He knows l like fresh flowers.
And l can report that a strange car...
...is parked in her garage
at least once a week.
There.
My secret is out.
l am having an affair
with a Mercedes-Benz.
We are in the house of the Lord.
Oh, like she cares.
Ouisers never done
a religious thing in her life.
Now, that is not true.
When l was in school,
a bunch of my friends and l...
...would dress up as nuns
and go barhopping.
Ouiser, forgive me, but l just been
dying to ask you this.
Are you and Owen, you know...?
Wait, wait. l have to get
a mental picture of this.
A dirty mind is a terrible thing
to waste.
Not that this is any
of anyone elses business...
...but no. Were friends.
He would like more,
and l am dealing with that.
But l am old and set in my ways.
You are playing hard to get.
At her age, she should be playing
beat the clock.
-Miss DeLord, is 240 on telemetry?
-Yes, he is.
Thank you.
May l help you?
Could somebody fix my /V, please?
Someonell be there in a minute.
Wendy, will you check 240s lV?
l think that despite everything,
we have a very good result.
Looks good. Looks real, real good.
Thanks.
Surprise!
l cant believe this!
l have always wanted to give
a wedding shower with a monster motif.
Thats what you get
for getting married on Halloween.
My heart!
Come on, lets open the gifts.
Youre welcome. Next.
MLynn, applique....
With some little fringe on them
and some applique.
Quiet down. Quiet down.
lt says,  Better late than never.
Look out, Sammy!
-Whos that from?
-lts not signed.
Here, let me see.
What?
ld recognize
this penmanship anywhere.
You have the handwriting
of a serial killer.
l just thought Sammy wouldnt mind
you reading the Bible in bed...
...if you were wearing
something inspirational.
Yuck, yuck.
Put down split crotch.
-This is from Shelby.
-Thats disgusting.
Shes sorry she couldnt be here.
Shes on duty.
-How is she?
-Fine.
l fed baby Renz,
but l havent fed Alex, okay?
-Gotta get home for Halloween.
-Have a good evening.
This is too cute.
Now, where did you find it?
Aunt Fern made it. l cant wait
to get home and try it on Jack.
l even taught him to say,
trick or treat, or something--
Something kind of like it.
Could you hand me that bag, Pam?
-Thanks.
-Good night.
Good night.
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
lf this dont work on my husband,
come back.
-Yes, maam. Thank you.
-See you.
Looks like somebodys husbands
coming home tonight.
When you work a seven-day stretch
on an oil rig...
...all you wanna do
on your day off is sleep.
But lm gonna do everything l can
to keep him up.
Anne Boleyn had six fingers.
Whos Anne Berlin?
Anne Boleyn. She was one
of the six wives of Henry Vlll.
l never watch public television.
She had six fingers.
What happened to the other four?
She had 1 1 total.
Are you trying to confuse me?
No. l just want to expose us...
...to a little more culture.
And thats not easy to come by
in this neck of the woods.
How about taking a theatre trip
to New York?
l dont wanna expose myself
to anything.
Broaden your horizons.
You broaden your horizons your way,
and l will broaden my horizons mine.
lm gonna support the arts
in this area.
lll write a check. l support art.
l dont have to see it.
lt wouldnt harelip you.
Can l get one thing straight with you?
l do not see plays,
because l can nap at home for free.
l dont see movies, because theyre
trash and got naked people in them.
l dont read books, because
theyll make them into a miniseries.
You would be a much more contented,
pleasant person...
...if you would find ways
to occupy your time.
l am pleasant!
Damn it! l just saw Drum Eatenton
at the Piggly-Wiggly...
...and l smiled at the son of a bitch
before l could help myself!
lm sorry, Miss Ouiser.
You take your Bible and shove it
where the sun doesnt shine.
Put it in Mommys pocket.
There we go.
Well zip you up, and well go
trick-or-treating right after dinner.
Lets go in and make some spaghetti.
Lets go call Daddy, okay?
Darling, lm home.
Whats the matter, pal?
What?
Whats the matter?
Okay, buddy.
Oh, my God.
Okay, baby, just wait right here.
Shelby? Baby?
--rejection of the kidney....
The coma may be irreversible.
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Gladys.
Were doing our Jane Fonda.
The exercises are good for her.
Heres the one where
youre holding him.
Youre looking at him,
hes looking at you...
...and then you all looked over at me.
Remember?
Open your eyes, Shelby.
Open your eyes. Look at him.
He wants you to open your eyes, Shelby.
He wants you to open your eyes.
Lesson Three:
Never be afraid...
...to try a brave new look.
Now, that could mean wearing...
...daring to wear...
...a sexy slip of a dress
that bares--
Honey, itll do you good
to get out for a while.
Eat a real dinner.
What if she wakes up for two minutes
and lm not here?
For example...
...we know where you can get
a top-of-the-line hairstyle--
Call Clairee.
Call Connollys Funeral Home.
lts the nicest.
Youre gonna have to get
her pink suit.
The one with the little red cherries
on the lapel.
Wheres Jack, Jr.?
Aunt Ferns.
Theres your grandma.
Pumpkin.
Does this tie go?
You look real nice.
Thought ld come to the funeral,
if you dont mind.
l dont mind.
l feel sorry for them, you know?
l mean, especially Jackson.
Losing Shelby like that.
lf that ever happened to me...
...l dont know what ld do.
A thing like this just
doesnt make any sense.
No sense at all.
l just think about what Annelle says:
The Lord works in mysterious ways.
What the hells this for?
lt makes you pretty.
Come on home, honey.
How you holding up, honey?
lm fine.
lt was a beautiful service.
The flowers were the most
beautiful flowers l have ever seen.
They were beautiful.
lt should make you feel a lot better
that Shelby is with her King.
Yes, Annelle, l guess it should.
-We should all be rejoicing.
-Well, you go on ahead.
lm sorry if l dont feel like it.
l guess lm selfish.
ld rather have her here.
l dont mean to upset you
by saying that.
lts just that...
...when something like this happens...
...l pray very hard to make
heads or tails of it.
And l think that in Shelbys case...
...she just wanted to take care
of that little baby...
...and of you, of everybody she knew.
And her poor little body was
just worn out.
lt just wouldnt let her do
all the things she wanted to.
So she went on to a place
where she could be...
...a guardian angel.
She will always be young.
She will always be beautiful.
And l personally feel much safer
knowing that shes up there on my side.
lt may sound real simple
and stupid and....
Well, maybe l am...
...but thats how l get through
things like this.
Thank you, Annelle.
l appreciate that.
And its a real good idea.
Shelby wouldnt want us
to get mired down and wallow in this.
We should handle it
the best way we know how...
...and get on with it.
Thats what my mind says.
l wish somebodyd explain it
to my heart.
Drum says you never left her side
for a second.
l couldnt leave my Shelby.
l just sat there...
...and kept on pushing the way l always
have where Shelby was concerned.
l was hoping shed sit up
and argue with me.
And finally we realized
there was no hope.
We turned off the machines.
Drum left. He couldnt take it.
Jackson left.
l find it amusing.
Men are supposed to be made out of
steel or something.
But l just sat there.
l just held Shelbys hand.
There was no noise.
No tremble.
Just peace.
Oh, God.
l realize...
...as a woman, how lucky l am.
l was there when that wonderful
creature drifted into my life.
And l was there when she drifted out.
lt was the most precious moment
of my life.
l gotta get back.
Has anybody got a mirror?
Does anybody have a mirror?
l dont know how youre doing
on the inside...
...but your hairs just
holding up beautiful.
Shelby was right.
This is a brown football helmet.
Honey, are you okay?
lm fine.
lm fine. lm fine.
lm fine!
l could jog all the way
to Texas and back...
...but my daughter cant.
She never could.
God! lm so mad,
l dont know what to do!
l wanna know why.
l wanna know why
Shelbys life is over.
l wanna know how that baby will ever
know how wonderful his mother was.
Will he ever know what she
went through for him?
Oh, God, l wanna know why!
Why?!
Lord, l wish l could understand.
lts not supposed to happen this way.
lm supposed to go first.
lve always been ready to go.
l dont think l can take this.
l dont think l can take this.
l just wanna hit somebody
till they feel as bad as l do.
l just wanna hit something.
l wanna hit it hard!
Here.
Hit this.
Go ahead. Slap her!
-Are you crazy?
-Hit her!
-Are you high, Clairee?
-Have you lost your mind?
Well sell T-shirts saying,
l Slapped Ouiser Boudreaux !
Hit her!
Miss Clairee, enough.
Ouiser, this is your chance to do
something for your fellow man.
Knock her lights out!
Let go of me!
You missed the chance of a lifetime.
Half of Chinquapin would give...
...their eyeteeth
to take a whack at Ouiser.
You are a pig from hell!
Ouiser, dont leave!
l was just kidding. Come back!
That was not a very
Christian thing to do.
Annelle, you gotta lighten up.
Go away.
Okay, all right. Hit me, then.
l deserve it.
You are evil,
and you must be destroyed.
Mother Natures taking care of that
faster than you could.
Things were getting entirely
too serious for a moment.
We needed to laugh.
l bet Lloyd got a kick out of it.
Lloyd got a great deal of enjoyment
at my expense when he was alive.
You know l love you
more than my luggage.
This is my bench.
Get off my bench!
Get off my--!
Good. Now, sit.
You are too twisted for colour TV.
Have your roots done.
l shouldnt have gone on
the way l did. l made everybody cry.
Dont be silly. Laughter through
tears is my favourite emotion.
Thanks, Annelle.
Maybe l should have
an emotional outburst more often.
Maybe l should start
having them at home.
Drum would be so pleased.
Well, lm glad to see
the two of you made up.
Ouiser can never stay mad at me.
She worships the quicksand l walk on.
Youre in my prayers.
Yes, Annelle, l pray.
Well, l do. There, l said it.
l hope youre satisfied.
l have suspected this all along.
Dont you expect me to come
to one of your churches.
Those tent revivals with those
Bible-beaters doing God-knows-what.
Theyd probably make me eat
a live chicken.
Not on your first visit.
Very good, Annelle.
Spoken like a true smart-ass.
What are you doing?
Are you eating my picture?
Lets get in the swing.
Get our feets in there.
There we go.
Hold on.
l dont know if this is
the right time or place...
...but l wanted to tell you...
...that Sammy and l have decided
if this babys a girl...
...wed like to name it Shelby...
...since she was the reason we met
in the first place.
lf you dont mind.
Shelby would love that.
lm tickled pink.
Pink.
What are you gonna name it
if it happens to be a boy?
Shelby, l guess.
Thats how it should be.
Life goes on.
lve never been so uncomfortable
in all my life.
Well talk about  uncomfortable
when youre nine months pregnant.
Keep those eyes closed,
or lll staple them shut.
-Theyre closed!
-Keep them closed.
-Now?
-Ready?
Keep them shut.
-Open them up.
-All right.
l dont believe it!
lm a chain!
-Jesus!
-Lighten up.
Now, you just burst through
those bushes...
...and hop over to
where the kids are, okay?
What bushes? l cant see shit!
Over there.
Over there.
lm an adult.
lm not a 5-year-old!
On your mark. Get set. Go!
Okay, Jack, Jr.
lm gonna tell you a story.
Once upon a time, there was
a beautiful young gal...
...named Shelby.
And Shelby had a lovely, kind...
...and wonderful good fairy named...
...Clairee.
But there was also a horrible...
...evil, ugly witch named...
...Ouiser.
l hate these stupid
neighbourhood things.
No ones twisting your arm
to keep you here.
Well, l have to be sociable.
Rhetts here.
Lets connect the bald spots.
Eat shit and die.
Hello, MLynn.
Good to see you too, Ouiser, Owen.
Come on, Rhett! Kill, kill!
Quit it, Drum.
Stop egging him on.
And everyone lived happily ever after.
And the nasty, wicked,
evil, wretched...
...horrible, mean Ouiser...
...was never heard from again.
Now, its almost time
for the Easter Bunny.
Run on down.
Hi, Jack! You remember me?
lts your old pal Ouiser.
Just a second. lts Jackson.
Jack, come here!
ls he all right?
Yes, hes all right.
Honey, its okay. lts okay.
Women have babies every day.
Jonathan, quick!
Get that Easter Bunny over here now.
-Tommy, wheres Sammy?
-Over there.
-Excuse me.
-Why? Whats going on?
Oh, my God! Shes gonna have a baby.
Go get a doctor!
Help! A doctor!
This way, this way.
Get her in.
Well find Sammy.
lts all right, honey.
Well get Sammy.
Come on, Sammy!
Get your tail hopping!
