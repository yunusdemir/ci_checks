It looks good.
On the northwest toll, eastbound trafflc
is moving nicely this morning...
from Beecham Road
down to River Road.
Westbound, there's now a 20-car
backup at the Devon Avenue toll.
And on the northbound l-290
extension at Thorndale Avenue,
we had a spinout there.
And that car was blocking
the right-hand lane...
and also blocking the lane
that's coming off of the, uh,
eastbound Thorndale Avenue
entrance ramp...
leading to the northbound,
uh, l-290 extension.
- This was causing a backup to Irving Park.
- We have... -
Come on, chop-chop. We got
relatives invading this afternoon.
Ginny, Mike, Sara, Sam!
Come on. Everybody up!
Oh, I think I have a fever.
You don't have a fever.
Shut your face.
Make me.
Dad, Mike hit me!
You liar. Mike, come on, pal.
We got a wedding tomorrow.
Try to cooperate, will ya?
Dad, I didn't hit her.
I'd like to very much, and I probably
will later, but gimme a break.
You know my method. I don't hit her
when you're just down the hall.
Pick on someone your own size.
Open this door.
Daddy, I'm the one
getting married.
Not until tomorrow. I've
got a mouthful of toothpaste.
I happen to have
a serious problem.
Dad.
She got her period. Should make for
an interesting honeymoon, huh?
- Where are you learning that stuff?
- School.
Good. Gettin'
my money's worth.
They were fantastic.
Just great. What a great crowd.
And it was so much fun...  'It's
a good thing you don't have busfare '
'It would fall through the hole
in your pocket and you'd lose it '
'In the snow on the ground '
' You gotta walk into town
to flnd a job '
' You're trying to keep
your hands warm '
"Chronologically, you're 16 today.
Physically,
you're still 15.
Hopeless.
Nope. I look exactly the same
as I have since summer.
Utterly forgettable.
No, I didn't expect
to wake up transformed.
I just thought that turning 16
would be so major...
that I'd wake up with an improved mental
state that would show on my face.
All it shows is that I don't
have any sort of a tan left.
I better get downstairs.
My family's probably pissed off I haven't
let them wish me happy birthday yet.
All right.
I'll see you at school.
You need four inches of bod
and a great birthday.
Where's my briefcase?
Where'd you leave it?
Don't be a smart-ass.
Okay, I'll be a dumb-ass.
You already are.
Okay, where's Sam?
Where's my briefcase?
Sam? Allow me, Brenda.
Hey, birth defect!
You missed breakfast again.
It wasn't my idea to
give her her own phone line.
Grab a doughnut.
It's small. It's brown.
It's made of leather.
It has my initials on it.
And I believe... that's it.
Don't forget the
grandparents are coming this afternoon.
Are we still having dinner with the
Rice Chex? Rizczechs. 8:00 at the club.
You'd better learn their names.
As of tomorrow, they're family.
That's a lovely thought. Hmm.
When it comes your turn to get
married, do me a favor. Elope.
Who'd marry her?
Mr. T.
I'm sorry, you'll have to buy lunch today.
I didn't have time to fix your carrots.
She's only eating carrots to
increase the size of her breasts.
Mister, you had better shape up, or
you will miss your sister's wedding.
Promise?
Now, don't give me
that pouty look of yours.
You can eat your carrots
when you get home.
That's it? You don't have
anything else to say to me today?
What would you like me
to say, Sam?
Come on now, honey.
You're gonna miss the bus.
Have a good day.
I can't believe this.
They fucking forgot my birthday.
~~
I'm sure they didn't
forget your birthday.
They just didn't remember it right away.
Same difference.
It's a drag your sweet 16's the
day before Ginny gets married.
But big deal. They'll remember.
Oh, easy for you to say.
Did anyone ever forget your birthday?
Come on, Sam.
Everything's getting shittier. My family
forgetting my birthday just makes it more vivid.
What do you expect,
a breakfast birthday party?
No, but they could have at least said "happy
birthday." It was just like any other day.
Why don't you remind them?
They'll feel some massive guilt.
It could be highly profitable.
I wouldn't stoop to remind them.
Since I was about 1 2, I've been
looking forward to my sweet 16.
You know, a big party and a band,
with tons of people. Tons of people.
And a big Trans Am in the
driveway with a ribbon around it.
And some incredibly gorgeous
guy that you meet in France.
And you do it on a cloud without
getting pregnant or herpes.
I don't need the cloud. Just a
pink Trans Am and the guy, right?
A black one.
A black guy?
A black Trans Am. A pink guy.
Oh, no.
' To those nice, nice nights '
'I remember always always '
'I got such a fright '
'Seeing them in my dark cupboard '

You swear to God, you don't have it?
I don't know anything about it.
Jennifer Woods gave me a sex
test during child development.
And I was supposed to do it and pass
it to you in independent study.
I'm totally screwed.
Did you put your name on it?
Hi. No, but it was
really embarrassing.
I had to name who I'd do
it with if I ever did it.
Who'd you name?
Jake Ryan. Jake Ryan? He
doesn't even know you exist.
Thank you. That's
a very nice thing to say.
I'm sorry.
ButJake Ryan?
He's a senior, and he's taken.
I mean, really taken.
I know. It was
supposed to be my ideal.
He's ideal, for sure,
but forget it.
God, I hope whoever got the note
doesn't know it was me who wrote it.
I'd shit twice and die.
Do you know Samantha Baker?
Sophomore, right?
Yeah. What do
you think of her?
I don't.
Would you ever go out with her?
Depends on how much you paid me.
She's not ugly.
There's nothin' there, man.
It's not ugly.
It's just... void.
You know what I mean? There's
somethin' about her.
I do independent study with her.
I catch her lookin' at me a lot.
It's kinda cool, the way
she's always lookin' at me.
Maybe she's retarded.
I'm bein' serious, okay?
She looks at me like
she's in love with me.
Jake, she's a child.
So? So what're you
gonna do with her?
She's obviously too
young to party serious.
Maybe I'm interested
in more than a party.
Come on, Jake. You talk
like you're hard up.
You got Caroline.
Now she's a woman.
It's unbelievable.
I swear to God, Caroline Mulford
had to flunk about nine grades.
Truly makes me ill.
She's perfect.
Practically impossible to cut up.
She's supposedly real sweet.
Brother's deaf, and everybody
in the world worships her.
And she's going with Jake.
Oh, I'm gonna kill myself.
My man.
I loathe the bus.
There has to be a more
dignified mode of transportation.
I hope you get a car for
your birthday, and a license.
Let's not hold our breath.
Score... a direct hit.
On second thought.
'Hey"
Move it.
Call me, okay? You call me first.
Tell me what happened at home.
I can tell you
right now. Nothing.
Will you quit feeling sorry for yourself?
It's bad for your complexion!
How's it goin'?
How's what going?
You know, things, life, whatnot.
Life is not whatnot,
and it's none of your business.
Hmm. So you goin' to the new
faces dance tonight, or...
That's also none
of your business.
Are you inhibited
about dancing in public?
I mean, you don't have to dance.
Maybe you could just stand there with me
and my dudes and just be you, and... -
Sounds major.
So, I mean, what's the story?
I mean, you got a guy, or...
Yes, three big ones,
and they lust wimp blood.
So quit bugging me, or I'll sic
them all over your weenie ass.
You know, I'm getting input here that
I'm reading as relatively hostile.
I mean, it's just...
Go to hell.
Very hostile.
Come on, what's the problem here?
I'm a boy, you're a girl.
Is there anything wrong with me tryin' to put
together some kind of relationship between us?
Look, I know you have to go.
Just answer one question.
Yes, you're a total fag.
That's not the question.
Am I turning you on?
It's encouraging.
Very encouraging.
Yeah, uh-huh.
You know, a girl with a hat
is just so... Whew.
So vogue.
Uh, y-yeah.
Where are my blue socks,
Dorothy?
You mean you didn't pack them?
Oh, not again, Howard.
Can't I trust you
to do anything?
Do you expect me to do
all the packing?
Well, at least
I brought this for you. It...
Sam.  Samantha.
Look.
Oh, look.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Oh, God.
Oh, sweetheart!
My goodness, are you a sight
for sore eyes.
Oh, good!
Just look. How are you, my
little lamb chop? Hello!
I'm fine, Grandpa.
How are you guys? - Oh, pretty good.
Of course, I get lower back pain.
Oh, my corns are killing me. My arthritis
in my fingers bothers me quite a bit...
So are you, uh...
You're sleeping up here?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Your grandfather Fred jumped our claim
on Sara's room. So here we are up here.
Well, I haven't seen you in a while.
Do I look any older today?
Oh, no, no. I wouldn't say so.
Do you think so?
No. Oh, I hope
it isn't cold tomorrow.
You know Ginny.
It's not gonna be cold. She'll refuse
to wear a coat over her wedding dress.
If she does, you mustn't bug her...
I'm not gonna bug her...
I'm gonna go set myself up in Mike's room.
So I'll see you guys later.
- Okay, sweetheart.
- Look, there she goes.
Your grandpa and I are looking forward
to a nice, long visit with you.
Aces.  We certainly are.
See you a little later, darling.
We've got a lot to...
I swear to God,
this has got to be a joke.
Grandparents forgetting
a birthday?
They live for that shit.
~ Put my arms around you ~~
Well, well, if it isn't
Sammy Baker...
Davis, Junior.
Hi, Grandpa. Oh,
I've got one for ya.
Knock, knock.
Who's there?
Who.
Who, who?
Helen, we've got an owl out
here in the hall.
Oh, Fred, Fred, leave her alone.
You'll make her tinkle.
Oh, come on, Helen.
Oh, Sam, let me look at you.
Oh.
Fred, she's gotten her boobies.
I'd better
go get my magnifying glass.
Oh, and they are so perky!
I can't believe my
grandmother actually felt me up.
What's happenin', hot stuff?
His name is Long Duk Dong.
What?
Long Duk Dong.
He came down with
Grandma and Grandpa Baker.
He's an exchange student
that's living with them.
Yeah, well, he's totally bizarre.
He is not.
He is a very sweet boy.
I just hope you burn the sheets
and mattresses after he leaves.
I don't suppose it makes
any difference to you,
but there's a very weird
Chinese guy up in Mike's room.
Ginny dumped Rudy.
He's her new fiancee.
Mike, stop it.
Sam, honey, do you think you could
help the grandmothers with supper?
Dad and I have to go to the club
for dinner with the Rice Chex.
Rizczechs.
Oh. Rizczechs.
Uh, do you think
that there's any reason...
that I should
possibly stay home tonight?
Well, it might be nice
if you'd visit...
with your grandparents
and Long Duk Dong.
Who?
The weird Chinese guy
in Mike's room. Oh.
- I think I have a dance to go to.
- Well, that's okay.
Oh, can you remember
to turn off the stove in 20 minutes?
I can remember lots of things.
This is the single
worst day of my entire life.
What the hell
are you bitchin' about?
I gotta sleep under some Chinaman
named after a duck's dork.
Well, where am I sleeping?
Sofa City, sweetheart.
~~
Do you think Grandpa Fred's
going to embarrass me?
I don't know why not.
He does to everyone else.
He already asked me if Rudy
was the oily variety bohunk.
Is he?
Don't be cute.
I really love Rudy.
And he is totally
enamored of me.
I mean, I've had men
who've loved me before,
but not for six months in a row.
I think I'm in love.
So how long have you been
in love, hmm?
Well, it hasn't
really happened yet.
So what's the deal?
I'm not sure
that he knows I exist.
Sam, I really don't
have time for this.
Well, I'm sorry.
I always listen to you talk
about your boyfriends.
Darling, is something
bothering you?
You're really acting like...
an asshole.
And I think I know what it is.
I think you're jealous
that I'm getting married...
and that I'm getting
all the attention, hmm?
You know,
everybody in this family...
has just gone
totally Outer Limits.
No, Sam.
I think you're just being
a little selfish and immature.
Oh, yes. That's it.
That's exactly it.
Unbelievable.
You make someone a bridesmaid,
and they shit all over you.
Very clever dinner.
Appetizing food fit neatly
into interesting round pie.
- It's a quiche.
- Hmm. How do you spell?
Well, you don't spell it, son.
You eat it.
Dong has only been in
our country a short time, Fred.
- I think we could all help him assimilate.
- Oh.
Long Duk Dong
is about your age, Sam.
You two should have
a lot to chat about.
I love, uh, visiting
with Grandma and Grandpa...
and writing letters
to parents...
and pushing
lawn-mowing machine...
so Grandpa's hyena
don't get disturbed.
Hernia!
Oh, yes, yes, yes, indeedy.
He does the dishes and helps
with the laundry. You betcha.
May I be excused?
Where are you going?
I have a dance to go to...
at school.
It's a very important dance.
Uh, we're being graded on it...
for gym.
Wait a minute.
I have a wonderful idea.
Would you like to go
to the dance with Sam?
~~
I wonder ifJake's here.
I don't think it's healthy to get jacked
about some guy that isn't a thing yet.
Yeah, when you don't have anything, you
don't have anything to lose, right?
That's a cheerful thought.
Let's go make
ourselves available.
That's the one, dude.
Scope it out.
She doesn't look like a freshman.
Sophomore, dude. Sophomore.
Fully aged sophomore meat.
We do the bus together.
You talk to her?
Talk? Dude, I have a
relationship with her. Get out.
Figure to, like, 1 7 digits.
You are such a liar.
We'll see about that, my man.
By night's end, I predict
me and her will interface.
'Ahh '
'Ahh '
'I know this '
'Much is true '
'Ahh '
'I know this..."
Check it out, Wease.
Pretty intense, huh? Over.
To the max. Over.
All right.
"I knew you'd come around.
Whoa.
Christ.
Crank that, sister!
~ Whoa ~
Very hot. Very hot.
This night... This night
is happenin'.
~ Whoa, whoa, whoa ~~
I'm blowing your mind, aren't I?
I'm just getting warmed up.
Ow. Excuse me.
Way to go, dick-face.
She took off.
Don't spaz out. Okay, Wease?
The situation'll come on-line.
Yeah? I'll bet you a dozen floppy
disks you don't even get tit.
You got a bet, scumbag.
I'll get it all.
Take off. You wouldn't be
able to prove it anyway.
"A," don't hit me.
Secondly, what kind
of proof do you want?
Video.
Video.
No way. I can just see the thing
getting duped a thousand times...
and winding up on cable
somewhere.
Try again.
Underpants.
Underpants.
No problem,
butt-lick.
Girls' underpants.
' One, two '
'And your girlfriend sweet
little 1 7 '
'She's got her layered hair
and her flaredjeans '
' You know what that means
She's just a little queen '
'She shares your London flat '
'She thinks that London's
where it's at '
'Although it stinks and when it rains
you wear your hat '
'And your plum-colored PVC
wet-look maxi mac '
' You tie your ginger hair
back in a bun '
' You're the ugliest creature
under the sun '
So what's your name?
Dong.
What's your first name?
Long.
What's your middle name?
Duk.
I bet all the boys chase you
plenty in the school, huh?
Nobody's caught me yet.
Hmm. I betcha you big teaser, huh?
No. I run
the 40 in five flat.
Flat?
Hey.
Oh, I'm really sorry, man.
Whatever I did was an accid...
l-l-I didn't mean to...
Relax.
You... You were dancin'
with a girl?
Oh, man, I'm really...
I'm really sorry, man.
I must've been on drugs five minutes ago.
Do you know her?
She grabbed me, guy. I'm totally innocent.
Is she yours?
"What do you
know about her?
"She has smallish tits.
Decent voice.
Smells pretty good.
She drives me crazy.
Did she come here with you?
No, no. But if it's okay with my
dad, she's goin' home with me.
Excuse me.
Do you guys want
to blow off this dance?
Yes. -  I am
bored to the brink of insanity.
And go where? - Jake's
parent's aren't home. We can do his house.
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.
Let's party light. Jake's
paranoid about his house getting trashed.
Again.
' One single moment
The hours I spend '
Oof.
Okay.
All right.
Just tryin' to get
a little bit of water.
Yeah.
~~
Yes, I'm back.
So I smell.
It's my shaving cream.
You wanna feel a real clean, close shave?
I'll pass.
Couldn't find
anyone else to bug, huh?
Come on. You know you're the
one I want to bug, huh?
This is my friend, Randy.
And that's Jimmy Montrose.
Howdy, dude.
This is Farmer Fred.
Ted.
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Farmer Ted.
I'm not really a farmer.
I'm a freshman.
Geek, can I be honest with you?
Not if you're gonna insult me.
Okay.
Shoot.
- Get the hell outta here.
- Nice! Nice manners, babe!
She's totally serious,
ass-wipe.
Chill.
You wanna split
with me? L...
I don't know. You know, my
mom, I can't handle this.
She tells me, "You want somethin',
you gotta ask for it."
I mean, I'm not the kinda guy...
It's embarrassing for me.
I don't know. I just...
It's just...
I'm really sorry about
what happened in the gym.
L-I had no idea
you couldn't dance.
What a decent night, huh?
It's my birthday.
~ You say it's your birthday ~
~ It's my birthday too ~~
~~
Don't do that, okay?
~ Hey, Jude ~~
Just stop it, okay?
I mean, it's really been
a shitty birthday for me.
No offense, but I don't need
a serenade right how.
What's wrong? You didn't
get anything good, or...
I didn't get shit.
Not even a "happy birthday."
My whole family
just sort of blew it off.
I'd freak if my family forgot my birthday.
It's a brand-new year.
I'm 16. Everything
should be platinum.
I should be happy, right? Right?
Yeah.
Well, I can't get happy.
It is physically impossible
for me to get happy.
Would you feel better if you
knew one of my secrets, or...
Don't gross me out.
No, we're not talking
gross here.
No. It's...
It's just embarrassing.
This information
cannot leave this room, okay?
It would devastate
my reputation as a dude.
No problem.
I've never bagged a babe.
I'm not a stud.
I got the rep in sixth grade.
And it, like, it stuck with me.
I'm still on hold.
Look, I'd appreciate you not
laughing here, okay?
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.
I meant...
Hey, time out, junior.
Pardon me.
It's okay.
I meant that it's okay
that you did it once,
but I didn't mean
for you to do it again!
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
You know, just now I really
felt how much you like me.
You're probably zoning in
on my brain waves or something.
Well, not really.
I felt it on my leg.
Come on.
I don't want to see it!
Oh.
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
I'm not embarrassed.
Fresh breath's a priority in my life.
I don't want
to hurt your feelings,
'cause it's really human of you
to listen to my bullshit.
I care about it, really.
I mean...
I know I came on kinda like a poozer
on the bus tonight and everything.
But that's just so my friends won't
think, you know, I'm a jerk.
But they're all pretty much
jerks, though, aren't they?
Yeah, but the thing is,
I'm kinda like the leader.
Kinda like the king
of the dipshits.
Well, that's pretty cool. Hey, but
a lot can happen over a year.
I mean, you could come back next
fall as a completely normal person.
Yeah?
Sure.
Would it be totally
off the wall if...
if I asked if I could
have sex with you?
Yeah, well, you askin' me is not
as off the wall as why I won't.
- V.D.?
- No.
I'm sorta saving myself.
It's really stupid.
He doesn't even know I exist.
Who?
Who?
Jake Ryan.
You likeJake?
Ja...
Jake's my boy!
I just talked toJake in the gym.
He asked me about you. Did not!
He did too. He did!
He asked me what you were like.
Oh, my... Oh! If you're lying, I'll
beat the crap outta you. I'm not lying.
Oh, my God! What should I do?
Should I go up to him?
Should I say, "Hi, Jake, I'm Samantha"?
Maybe I should let him come to me.
This is not my department. But what if
I let him come to me, and he forgets?
What if he changes his mind?
Then I'm totally screwed, right?
Apparently so.
What would you do
if you were me?
I'm a gamblin' man by nature.
And, um, I'd go for it.
This is so strange. But I think I will.
Oh, you're the best.
- Wait, um...
- What?
Do you know anything
about floppy disks?
We'll talk about this on the bus, okay?
The thing is, I got a problem.
Floppy disks
are pretty expensive.
I made a bet with my friends, the...
the dipshits.
Um,
I bet them
that I'd do it with you.
This was before I knew you. I can
get proof without getting physical.
How?
Can I borrow your underpants
for ten minutes?
'Hope you're feelin"
' Time '
I think it's time to blow this thing
off and go to your house. Yeah?
I told Tracy and Robin and those guys
to come to your parents' house, okay?
I told 'em not to tell anybody.
God, I love it when
your parents are out of town,
I fantasize that I'm your wife,
and we're the richest,
most popular adults in town.
I owe all my great weekends
to you.
What's your problem?
What?
You've been acting weird all night.
Are you screwing around?
Me? Are you crazy?
I don't know, Jake.
I'm getting strange signals. Well,
they're not comin' from me.
Everything's fine.
Don't have a cow.
Okay.
Just remember one thing.
I can name 20 guys
who'd kill to love me.
Is that a threat?
It's a fact, Jake.
Come on. Before we get in a big, wicked
fight, let's get outta here, huh?
Hi, Jake. I'm Samantha.
How's it goin'?
Do you got a cigarette?
Jake, this may sound
incredibly dumb,
but I love you, and I'll do
anything to make you love me.
I love your shirt.
Jake, you're not
gonna believe this,
but I had this very bizarre
dream, and you were in it.
For heaven's sake.
Get in there and dance.
I can't. They won't like me!
I'm not gonna tell you again!
Just act like a man! I wanna go home.
I wanna be with you guys.
~~
' You-ou are my desire '
' You... You are my desire '
' You-ou are my desire '
' Oh, baby, you, you, you
you are my desire '
' Got to flnd you
Know you're out there '
I can't believe I'm such a jerk.
"He smiles at me,
and I don't say anything.
And I can't believe
I gave my panties to a geek.
What year are you?
Freshman.
Gimme a buck.
Get in.
Shut up!
Bryce?
Ted, go for it.
Hey, uh, listen, uh,
I wanna thank you for,
uh, loanin' me the Donger.
He's really bitchin'.
That's okay.
You guys make a great couple.
I never been so happy in my whole life.
You maniac!
Now I have a place to put my hand.
Mmm.
So basically, Jimmy, my
business is video game arcades,
laundry, cigarette machines...
And trucking.
I dabble a little bit
in personal loans and politics.
Very nice.
I think that all that really matters
is that the kids are happy together.
Just as long as
my beautiful boy remembers...
that marrying this one means he's
out of the girl of the month club.
Hey, wait a minute. I can still look.
I just can't touch.
Right?
Oh, sensitive, uh?
Rudy!
Cheers. - Right on.
Ahh! You do shots?
Come on, wolf it.
Whoo!
Uh, good night, Marlene.
See you later, Dong.
Sammy, tell Grandpa not to wait up.
Let's go boogie.
Sure.
Donger's here for five hours,
and he's got somebody.
I live here my whole life,
and I'm like a disease.
' We're hangin'out in
Vinnie's car ' -
' We like
the really loud guitar '
'Don't ever seem
to get too far '
'Spend all our money in a bar '
Everybody,
I'd like you to meet
my boyfriend Jake.
Jake, this is... everybody.
Take it off.
All right, whose is this?
You're such a poop.
'FarmerJohn ' Woof.
'I'm in love
with your daughter '
Oh, no.
Easy, easy, easy.
Shit, Ted,
that's my mom. I gotta get home.
Change your frequency.
Don't be such a wimp!
Take those ridiculous things
off, okay?
Will you guys grow up?
Ted, won't we get pounded
if we go to a senior party?
Wease, we got $70, and we got
a pair of girl's underpants.
We're safe as kittens.
Okay?
This is a great social
opportunity for us.
Come on!
Do not embarrass me, okay?
For sure, we won't.
Will you fix your hair, Bryce?
I already did.
Wease, close your barn,
all right?
And be polite to his parents.
Okay. Great.
Hey, come on in and party
hearty, dude persons.
He's from out of town, okay?
He speaks English, right?
Don't be such faggots!
Man, shut up.
Kidding. Sorry.
Think we're gonna die?
Definitely.
Did you put the cat out?
We don't have a cat.
Come on, damn it.
Answer.
Mmm.
Aw, eat me.
Who is it?
Well, what did they want?
Sex.
Whoo.
Geek!
Very nice!
We're five minutes in...
I'm at a loss.
Real smooth, Cliff.
Ooh.
I've never been out
with a boy before.
Oh, me neither.
Jake?
Where are you, Jake?
Jakey, have you
stopped loving me?
Leave me alone.
What? I'm sorry,
I don't do that.
Yes, you do.
I know.
Come on.  Trace.
You guys.
Would you
help me, please?
Oh, shit! Come on, you guys.
I'm your prom queen.
Trace, you
guys, I'm serious.
Come on. I need help.
Okay.
I need help too.
What is the problem?
Several things.
Okay. We'll help you.
Don't go away, Caroline, baby.
Hello?
Hello?
Listen, I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.
Yes, hello, sir. Um...
Are you the little bugger
that's been calling up...
and then hanging up?
Would it be possible to tell me if
there is a Samantha Baker there?
And if so, sir, may I
converse with her briefly?
Yes, it is.
And no, you may not.
Might I leave a message, sir?
He wants to leave
a message for Sam.
Here, give me that phone.
Now, you listen to me, mister.
God did not put me on this earth to
be awakened by filthy suggestions...
from a foul-mouthed hooligan
like you.
And as for our granddaughter, I'm sure
she has more than enough sense...
to stay clear of the likes
of you!
Now, good night
and good-bye!
That was great.
Sam's lucky she has us, Howard.
Yeah.
Even if she doesn't
appreciate us.
Do you promise you won't get mad?
No, I love you.
Okay,
close your eyes.
Scalpel.
Scalpel.
Oooh!
My God.
That was wonderful.
I don't know how
to thank you enough.
My pleasure.
My God. Wow.
I hope they have insurance.
The party's over.
What a disaster.
Jake!
Sam.
Sweetheart?
Daddy?
Hi, kiddo.
What's wrong? Nothing.
Everything's fine.
I was just upstairs,
and I couldn't sleep.
I feel like a real jerk, honey.
We forgot your birthday.
I bet you're really
P.O. 'd, huh?
No, it's okay. I'm not really
all that upset anymore.
This wedding is really turning
this entire house inside out.
And I just came down to tell you
that we did remember.
Thanks, Dad.
Happy birthday.
Is something else wrong?
No, why?
I don't know, I just get the feeling
that something's bothering you.
Something other than
your birthday.
No, I'm fine. Really.
I think I know what it is.
It has to do with a certain guy?
I know, honey.
I know.
We're all upset that
Ginny's marrying a bohunk.
What's the matter?
I meantJake.
Jake?
Wait a minute. I thought she said
his name was Rudy. Forget it.
Forget what?
Who's Jake?
He's a boy, Daddy. It's nothing.
Okay? Just forget it, please.
Come on, Sam.
We're not communicating.
It's extremely
embarrassing, okay?
What's embarrassing?
Sitting in the dark with your dad,
telling him about your love life.
I'm afraid you lost me
again, Sam.
Jake is a senior, and he's
beautiful and perfect.
I like him a real lot, and
he doesn't like me. Okay?
Oh.
And he's got this
incredible girlfriend.
I'm just this ridiculous dork that's
following him around like a puppy.
Why do you think you're a dork?
I don't think you're a dork.
I don't think Mom thinks you're a dork.
- Mike thinks I'm a dork.
- Mike is a dork.
But so am I.
Well, if it's any consolation,
I love you.
And if this guy can't see in you all the
beautiful and wonderful things that I see,
then he's got the problem.
I know. It just hurts.
That's why they call them crushes.
If they were easy,
they'd call 'em something else.
But if I were Ginny,
I'd have this guy
crawling on his knees.
Well, let me tell you something
about Ginny.
Now, I love her as much as I love you.
But she's a different person.
Sometimes I worry about her.
When you're given things
kind of easily,
you don't always
appreciate them.
With you, I'm not worried.
When it happens to you,
Samantha, it'll be forever.
Well, I don't think I'll be able to sleep if I
don't feel this little talk has helped you.
So would you be a sport and lie to me?
Yeah, sure, Daddy.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night.
Oh, one more thing, sweetheart.
What?
When you do find the right guy,
don't let him boss you around.
Make sure he knows you wear
the pants in the family.
These are really hers?
Yeah.
How did you get 'em?
She gave 'em to me.
Did you...
No! No, Jake.
She's crying for you.
I told her you asked about her.
Right? The girl freaked.
She had a hissy. She thinks
you're the cat's meow. Really?
Yeah. She came up to
me in the gym tonight.
She looked at me
like I was a leper.
Girls'll do that, Jake.
You see, they know guys are,
like, in perpetual heat, right?
They know this shit.
And they enjoy pumping us up.
It's pure power politics,
I'm tellin' you.
I thought she hated my guts.
Games, Jake.
Silly, torturous games.
You know how many times a week I go without lunch
because some bitch borrows my lunch money?
Any halfway decent girl
can rob me blind!
Because I'm too torqued up
to say no.
It's heinous, I'm telling you.
You better not be
dickin' me around.
It'd be a major downer
to try and get together...
and find out she really does
think I'm a slime.
Jake, would I dick you?
Let me put it to you this way.
What happens to me
if I dick you?
I'd kick your ass.
Right. So why would I lie?
But I feel compelled
to mention, Jake,
if all you want is a piece
of ass, I mean,
I'll either do it myself,
or get someone bigger than me,
to kick your ass.
I mean, not many girls in contemporary
American society today...
would give their underwear
to help a geek like me.
I can get a piece of ass
anytime I want.
Shit, I got Caroline in my bedroom
right now, passed out cold.
I could violate her ten
different ways if I wanted to.
What are you waiting for?
I don't know.
She's beautiful, and she's
built and all that.
I'm just not
interested anymore.
Does that really matter, guy?
Yeah, it matters.
She's totally insensitive.
Look what she did to my house.
She doesn't know shit
about love.
Only thing she cares
about is partying.
I want a serious girlfriend.
Somebody I can love,
that's gonna love me back.
Is that psycho?
That's beautiful, Jake.
I think a ton of guys feel the
same way as you do. Really?
Yeah. It's just they don't... They
don't have the balls to admit it.
You know? They're just...
They're wimps.
Samantha's, uh... She's
really special, you know?
I'll make a deal with you.
Let me keep these. I'll
let you take Caroline home.
But you gotta make sure she gets home. You
can't leave her in some parking lot somewhere.
Okay?
Jake, I'm only a freshman.
So? She's so blitzed, she
won't know the difference.
Jake, I don't have a car.
You can take mine.
Jake, I don't have a license.
I trust you.
Jake, I'd love to.
I can't. Want a pretzel?
You sure?
Positive.
I got her.
You got her?
Yeah.
Is this, uh, your car, Jake?
No, this is my dad's car.
You said you couldn't
drive a stick.
This is a mother...
This is a Rolls-Royce,
Jake.
So?
So! So.
I heard the grill alone
cost five grand on this.
Five grand!
I don't have five grand.
Then don't hit anything.
Ahh, don't hit anything.
Do you want to do this or not?
No.
Who the hell?
Who does he...
Mm-hmm. Mmm.
Who's he?
That's me.
Who are you?
I'm him.
Oh.
Okay.
She's totally gone.
Have fun.
Thanks.
Jake, is your dad a big man, or...
About 6'4".
Very nice.
Ho.
Ohh.
Oh.
Ho.
Easy.
Easy.
~~
'Hey, sucker '
' What the hell's got into you '
'Hey, sucker"
Oh, sexy girlfriend.
Banzai!
Think they liked us?
Definitely.
"Whoo! Go, darling geek!
Uh, could we turn that music down?
I'm a first-time driver.
I need to concentrate.
Excuse me!
Stop that.
Looks like rain.
Better put the top up!
Will you stop that? You can get us
in a lot of trouble doin' that!
This is a car!
It hasn't got Triple A on it.
Chugalug, Pooh bear.
I can't believe you're so
popular, acting like this.
Relax!
Hello?
Oh, uh, I don't know.
I'll have to look.
Mr. Ryan, are you in here? He's not...
Mr. Ryan's not in right now.
My Christmas present to you!
Thank you. No. Really. Serious.
See? See?
Thank you.
Now we're both on the pill!
You gave me a
birth control pill?
You have any idea what
that'll do to a guy my age?
I know exactly what it'll do
to a girl my age.
"Just climb in the car!"
Shit.
It makes it okay to be super careless.
Wait, wait!
Ha-ha!
Look, we're not going any further
until you stop these childish antics.
Don't be such a poop.
Huh. On second thought.
I love you.
This is getting good.
Ted, what the hell
are you doing?
Are those humongous jocks back?
Do you have any film in your camera?
What?
Take those ridiculous things off.
Do you have any film in your camera?
Sure.
Okay. Go get it and bring it outside.
Okay? Right out front.
What for? Look, just get it
and come on out front, okay?
U.F.O.?
It's better.
Extraterrestrial? It's better! All right?
Just get it and come outside.
Female extraterrestrial?
It's better than...
Shh!
Better than female
extraterrestrial?
How do you tell if it's a female?
'Cause it's got tits.
What makes 'em different
than regular tits?
They got four. Just get the camera.
It's in the closet.
Don't go in the closet.
Such assholes.
I can't believe it.
You should check that out. Why
do you always have to argue?
I'm not arguing. I am not! I am not!
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
Every time I do something, bitch,
bitch, bitch. Bitch is a female dog.
I am not even. What's
that supposed to mean?
Shit!
Shoot!
Ted, that's
a Rolls-Royce.
Ted, that's the prom queen. You
got two girls in one night.
I told you dudes I was hot.
Hot? You're a legend!
Will you shut up? People
around here work, all right?
Will you hurry it up? I'm breaking,
like, 30 major laws here.
You know, Ted, nobody's
gonna believe you.
No way.
That, my friends, is what
the pictures are for. Okay?
Just get that thing there.
- Are you guys ready?
- Wait, hold on.
Put it down just a bit. You guys
know what you're doing here?
All right, just a minute.
How's this look?
Very nice.
Wait, black and white. It would
capture the moment so nicely. Oooh.
Will you take
the picture already?
You're pissin' me off,
I'm tellin' ya.
Smile, pumpkin. What?
Oh! Pictures!
Cheers!
Marlene! Ohh!
Chill out, boy.
Mike, honey.
Go get dressed.
I can't believe it.
Ginny's not in the shower.
I wouldn't go in there. Grandpa Fred
was in there for a half an hour.
It's totally polluted.
Get dressed.
It's your nose.
They never listen.
What was he wearing?
Well, he would have...
He was wearing a red argyle
sweater and tan trousers.
Mmm. And red shoes.
Hmm?
No, he's not retarded.
Now, what can I do to help? Well,
you could finish the French toast.
Good.
I'll, uh... I'll just open
the doughnuts.
Good thinking. Oops. Don't
wanna lose the nails.
I'll just wait till I hear from you, then.
Voila. Breakfast is ready.
Oh, Sam.
Sam, I am so sorry
about your birthday.
It's okay.
I'll recover.
It's important to you.
And yesterday morning,
you were trying to tell me.
It's okay, Mom.
These things sometimes happen.
Oh, honey, I just
feel miserable.
You'll feel better.
Who died?
Uh...
Is there something
you want to say to your sister?
What? Are you kidding?
Where should I start?
I mean about her birthday.
It was yesterday.
We all forgot.
Classic.
Deep down, he's really sorry.
No, he's not.
I have to go to this wedding and
look like Miss Pretty Princess...
in this dipshit's
bridesmaid's dress.
I don't have one-tenth of the
bod to fill the stupid bust up.
So what? Should I just waste
myself and spare the agony?
I was gonna tell you something, but
maybe I shouldn't. It's pretty bad.
You may as well. Nothing
could shock me anymore.
Last night at the dance,
my little brother paid a buck
to see your underwear.
Geez! I hate that
rock 'n' roll rubbish!
Well, I'm afraid it's
here to stay, Howie.
Sam, you're dragging
your dress, honey. Pick it up.
Come on, Ginny. Hurry up, Susie.
Why is she so slow?
Do not fuss at your sister.
It's her wedding day. Big deal.
All right, is everybody in? Oh, dear.
Are you all right, Ginny?
Come on, everybody.
Get in the car, please.
We're late already.
Helen, will you get in the car? I don't
know what they're fussing about.
Helen, get in the car!
Hey, Howard,
there's your Chinaman.
Thanks, Fred.
Bye, Dong.
What the... What's he doin'
on the ground there?
What happened?
Hold a mirror in front of his mouth.
Howard! He's dead!
Aw, shit. I pay seven grand for
a wedding, I'll never see it!
Oh, watch your language,
Mr. Dirty Mouth.
Oh, thank God, he is still warm.
Oh, good.
Here, l-I'll help you.
Roll him over.
Ugh.  Canine cologne.
Oh, no more yankee my wankee.
The Donger need food!
Hell, he's three sheets to the wind!
He's drunk as a skunk! Shut up, Fred.
Shut up.
Dong!
Dong.
Dong, Grandpa is talking to you.
Dong. Where is my
automobile?
Automobile?
Lake.
Big lake.
Ohh!
Why, you little scuzzbag!
Oh, my.
Is everything all right?
I was afraid you'd
had an accident.
I wish. Her monthly
bill came early.
Well, she's fine.
Uh, she just took
a muscle relaxer.
Try four.
You didn't.
Mother!
Damn, Mom! I've got my headgear on.
Will you wake up?
Where the hell am I?
I'll, uh, tell you where you are,
if you'll tell me who you are.
Farmer Ted. You're in the parking lot
across the street from my church.
You own a church?
What happened?
I have no idea.
Did I do that to your hair?
At this point,
anything is possible.
Um, l... Uh...
Did, um...
Did we, uh...
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure.
Um, excuse me, but do you...
Do you know if...
Um, did I enjoy it?
Am I nuts?
Of course I enjoyed it.
I mean, um... What I
meant was, uh, did you?
Hmm.
You know, I have this
weird feeling I did.
Here, Ginny.
Drink this.
Come on.
"Here.
Wow.
Do I feel funky!
Uh-huh.
Okay. I'm comin'.
Hello? Geez, this place
is so confusing.
Okay.
Go away! I call F.I.B.!
I call police!
Go away.
Open the door.
No way, Jose!
Open the door.
You beat up my face!
You grabbed my nuts.
Is that you?
Yeah. That me.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I thought you my new...
new-style American girlfriend.
Forget it, man. Just get
Samantha, all right?
She not here. Don't jerk me around, man.
Where is she?
- She got married.
- What?
She at the church. She getting
married to oily bohunk.
Married?
Married.
Married?
Yeah. Married.
Married?
Married. Geez.
Are you gonna be all
right, sweetie?
It's gonna be
a piece of cake, Bren.
Um, Ginny,
I'm really happy for you.
I'm sorry for being
kind of a jerk lately.
That's really lovely, Sam.
I know you'll have
a great marriage.
- Ginny.
- Holy shit!
- She just had a cramp.
I don't care what she's got. Look
at her.  Will you be quiet?
We don't want to announce that she
has her period.
I guess those guys who thought we had to get
married feel pretty stupid, huh, Padre?
~ Here comes the bride ~
'Big, fat and wide"
Loved the teapot.
Excuse me.
Could you move over?
Oh!
Are you okay?
I gotta rest.
Come on. Here we go.
What's the matter?
Here comes the bride.
Oh!
Sorry.
I got it.
I got it!
Hi.
I know you.
Can't see with this thing on.
'Boom, bah-boom ' I never
went out with a freshman.
'Bah-boom, bah-boom ' Not
even when I was a freshman.
Me either.
You were pretty crazy.
'Bah, bah, bah-boom '
I was?
Yeah. You know
what I like best?
My clean, close shave?
No.
' Clean, close shave Ahh '
Waking up in your arms.
'Ah ' These things?
'Boom, boom-boom, boom '
' Ooh" Shit.
Mmm?
Jake.
Jake.
Holy shit.
Stay here, okay?
Oh, my God.
I'm dead.
Hello?  Ted. You
never called us back.
What happened? Look, Wease. I
told you not to call me here.
Ted, we're dying.
What happened?
You wanna know what happened?
Buy the book. Ted!
I'm really sorry about gettin'
you mixed up with that guy.
Oh, it's okay.
He wasn't too terrible.
Weird?
I'm really sorry
about last night.
The party.
Lots of things.
You know, neither one
of us is gonna die...
if it doesn't happen for us.
That's true.
I just don't know right now.
But I'm covered, okay?
L... I won't get hurt.
Sure.
I'll leave it up to you.
Fine.
Oh, my God. Her veil!
Come on, honey.
Honey.
Good-bye!
Come on.  Here we go.
Get her in the
back seat, Rudy!
Bon voyage.
See you later.
Bye!
Good-bye!
So long, kids!
Ohh!
Oh, hi. Uh, my sister
forgot her veil.
I know she wouldn't want anything
to happen to it. She's, um...
She's a little out of it.
Just a little bit.
Yeah. Uh, well, excuse me.
Everybody's waiting for me. I wanna
make sure I see my sister leave.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Oh, I need a drink.
