Yeah!
<i>On the 15th of May, in the jungle of Nool,</i>
<i>in the heat of the day,</i>
<i>in the cool of the pool,</i>
<i>he was splashing,</i>
<i>enjoying the jungle's great joys,</i>
<i>when Horton the Elephant</i>
<i>heard a small noise.</i>
- Horton!
- Horton!
Good morning, class. Are you ready?
- Yeah!
- Jump on board!
Look out below!
Tommy's on board. Katie, you there?
Okay.
There it is.
This is one of the jungle's most
amazing creatures, the leaf bug.
In order to protect itself from predators,
it disguises itself as a leaf.
This one's got quite a grip.
Come on, little buddy.
Don't be shy.
I guess I was mistaken, kids.
There are obviously no leaf bugs
in this area. Even if...
No, they're on me!
I think I swallowed one!
Tommy! Pull it out!
Uh, okay.
<i>Then humpfing a "humpf"</i>
<i>was a sour Kangaroo,</i>
<i>the type who's convinced</i>
<i>she knows better than you.</i>
<i>She made every law</i>
<i>and enforced every rule</i>
<i>as self-proclaimed</i>
<i>head of the jungle of Nool.</i>
Why can't I play with the other kids, Mom?
How many times have I told you that
the jungle is no place
to act like a wild animal.
My, that Horton certainly is eccentric.
And the children are learning
so much from him.
Learning to be a bunch
of harebrained half-wits!
And that's why my Rudy
is pouch-schooled.
<i>So while Kangaroo stood there,</i>
<i>sneering a sneer...</i>
Horton, that was the best time
I've ever had in my life!
What are you gonna show us next?
<i>... once again, the speck floated</i>
<i>right by Horton's ear.</i>
<i>Then he heard it again,</i>
<i>just a very faint yelp,</i>
<i>as if some tiny person</i>
<i>were calling for help.</i>
<i>And you know what he thought?</i>
<i>Why, he thought that</i>
<i>there must be someone</i>
<i>on top of that small speck of dust!</i>
<i>Or even a family, it just might be so,</i>
<i>a family with children</i>
<i>just starting to grow.</i>
I want to live!
I gotta go. Katie, you're in charge!
Wait!
- Come back!
- Watch it!
One more! One more! One more!
- I hear someone coming!
- Give me those!
- Wait!
- Sound the alarm!
Excuse me. Pardon my stampede!
Sorry, Wickershams! I promise
I'm gonna clean all this up later!
Bring the ammo!
I love the smell of bananas in the morning.
Banana in the hole!
Come on, guys! We're all mammals!
I feel the diplomatic process
is beginning to break down.
There you are! I got you!
Hi, kids!
Wow.
There.
Now you're safe.
I know I heard you say something.
I just know it.
Where are you?
Horton!
Sorry!
I just... There was this speck,
and it called out for help.
- And I was...
- The speck called out for help?
Well, not the speck.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
Is that what you thought I meant?
No, the speck can't call out for help.
Come on, get real.
No, there's a tiny person on that speck
that needs my help.
Absurd. There aren't people that small!
Well, maybe they aren't small.
- Maybe we're big.
- Horton.
No, really, think about it.
What if there was someone way out there
looking down on our world right now?
And to them, we're the specks.
And then, maybe someone else
will come along and say,
"Oh, there can't be people that small",
and the first guy would say,
"Are you calling me a liar?"
And the second guy would say,
"If the shoe fits, wear it!"
And now the fists are flying,
and the first guy picks up a brick,
and you might want to zip up the pouch
for this next part.
"All right, fat boy,
you want some of this..."
- Horton!
- What?
There is nothing on that speck.
- But I heard.
- Did you?
Really? Oh, my.
Then how come I don't hear anything?
Well...
If you can't see, hear or feel something,
it doesn't exist.
And believing in tiny, imaginary people
is just not something we do or tolerate,
here in the jungle of Nool.
Really? Because I bet if I really tried,
I could find somebody who'd believe
- what I've been saying.
- You will do nothing of the sort.
You will not breathe a word of this lie
to anyone else, especially the children.
I do not want you poisoning their minds
with this nonsense.
Our community has standards, Horton.
If you want to remain a part of it,
I recommend you follow them.
Have a nice day.
All right, then,
I'll take that under advisement.
Certainly appreciate your input.
I don't understand. I know I heard you.
It was as plain as the nose on my face.
That's it. Maybe you can't hear me.
Of course! Your ears must be tiny.
I need to speak up.
Hello!
<i>Now some people out there,</i>
<i>I think I know who,</i>
<i>may find they agree</i>
<i>with that sour Kangaroo.</i>
<i>"There can't really be people</i>
<i>as small as a mite. "
<i>Well, there can, and there are,</i>
<i>because Horton was right.</i>
<i>Hello!</i>
<i>That single "hello" traveled</i>
<i>all the way down</i>
<i>to the speck, through the clouds,</i>
<i>until it found a small town.</i>
<i>A town known as Whoville,</i>
<i>for there lived the Whos,</i>
<i>feeling happy and safe,</i>
<i>knowing only good news,</i>
<i>unaware that their world</i>
<i>was a speck on a clover,</i>
<i>unaware that the sweet life</i>
<i>they knew might be over.</i>
- Over!
- Under!
<i>The Mayor of Whoville,</i>
<i>a man named McDodd,</i>
<i>was devoted and fair and a little bit odd.</i>
<i>The Mayor and his wife,</i>
<i>they had children to spare,</i>
<i>96 daughters, some here and some there.</i>
<i>96 girls to love, 96 girls to teach,</i>
<i>but the Mayor had only</i>
<i>a few seconds for each.</i>
Daddy, I got better than best
on my Who-story test.
Who-story. I remember it well.
That's one of my girls.
- Hildy's been using my hairbrush!
- Holly's been using my hairbrush!
Look! Over there!
There. All better.
Can I please have a Who-phone, Dad?
Everyone else in my class has one.
Oh, really? Everyone?
I will think about it.
Daddy, look! Daddy, look!
Toof.
It's a "T-H", sweetheart. It's "tooth."
<i>In Whoville tradition, unlike yours or mine,</i>
<i>the Mayor's oldest is next</i>
<i>in the Mayoral line.</i>
<i>And who was the oldest?</i>
<i>To lead and stand tall?</i>
<i>It was JoJo, his son,</i>
<i>the smallest Who of all.</i>
So, JoJo, what's shaking?
What's happening? What's the word?
<i>Now, to you or to me, it's abundantly clear</i>
<i>that JoJo did not want his father's career.</i>
<i>But the Mayor pressed forward,</i>
<i>completely deluded,</i>
<i>while JoJo just sat there in silence</i>
<i>and brooded.</i>
Oh, JoJo!
- Hey, why does he get more time?
- That's not fair.
Son! Hey!
<i>And why didn't he speak?</i>
<i>Well, I think that the lad was afraid</i>
<i>if he did, he might let down his dad.</i>
You know what's awesome?
This is awesome.
Just look at the men and women
hanging on these walls.
You, my boy, are part of a family legacy
that spans centuries.
You know what?
Your grandfather was Mayor of Whoville,
and your great-grandmother, that's right,
all the way down to your
great-great-great-great-not-so-great-
great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great-great-great-
grandfather.
Someday I hope to join them.
Be one of the greats.
I tell you, JoJo, there is nothing
like being Mayor.
I get to sign resolutions,
approve ordinances, submit budgets,
and in the Edible Parade, I'm the one
sitting on top of the giant meatball.
Someday, that can be you, too, JoJo.
Someday you'll be the one wearing
the Mayoral Crest.
You just... You just need to...
You know what I mean?
Okay. Good chat.
I'm glad that we had this talk
that I'm continuing now by myself. Good.
There. That ought to be comfy.
Nothing wrong with this, Morton.
Nothing wrong with this.
Just you, me and the speck,
shooting the breeze.
We're a club. We're a group.
We can take a vote on the issues.
We can be a secret society that controls
the balance of power in the world.
- Horton.
- And no one else can join,
unless they wear funny hats.
Listen, Horton!
The Chair recognizes Brother Morton.
I am really happy you found
this speck and all,
but you might want to think
about keeping it to yourself.
What? Why?
Well, you're talking to a clover.
That doesn't look good.
You know what doesn't look good?
You talking about the speck
like the speck isn't even there.
The speck never said anything bad
about you.
But, hey! Good luck
with your illusion of superiority.
You know, the speck can think anything
it wants about me. It's a speck.
I see what's going on here.
Morton, no matter how tight
the speck and I get,
the speck could never replace you.
I'm only sad that I would have
to explain that, at this point.
Well, that's awesome, Horton.
That really helps.
Just try to keep this to yourself.
I'll see you later. Try.
Hey, Horton! What you got there?
What? Nothing!
We're not doing anything.
- We're totally alone.
- Who's "we"?
"We"? What? "We"? Did I say that?
I just... Oh.
No, I would never say that,
because that would imply that
I was with someone, and not alone.
Okay, seriously, you can't tell anybody.
I mean it.
If anybody finds out about this,
it could be very, very bad.
I'm not sure why.
We won't tell anyone.
And if we do,
we'll tell them not to tell anyone.
Perfect!
Okay, I'm taking a bath, right,
'cause my skin gets kind of dry
and a little bit ashy.
<i>While Horton came clean about</i>
<i>the speck that he'd found</i>
<i>and how he had saved it</i>
<i>when it nearly drowned,</i>
<i>the Mayor set off on his morning commute</i>
<i>and noticed things weren't quite</i>
<i>the same on his route.</i>
<i>But please don't blame Horton, for he</i>
<i>didn't know that a small bump above...</i>
...and I dove in the water like this!
<i>... was a big bump below.</i>
Hey, Joe, don't work too hard.
These luxury condos,
they don't build themselves.
Hey, look at that!
I guess they do build themselves.
Okay, that happened.
<i>Now, the Mayor knew it was his job</i>
<i>to convey the unusual things</i>
<i>that he'd noticed that day,</i>
<i>but there was one problem.</i>
<i>Though his will was strong...</i>
- You're late.
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.
<i>... nothing in Whoville</i>
<i>had ever gone wrong.</i>
We have all that we need.
We need all that we've got.
We like it in Whoville. We like it a lot!
We're all very busy with
the Who-Centennial coming up,
so let's bring this meeting to order.
Mr. Mayor, I presume you
have some good news for us.
Well, it's news.
I don't know if we need to go labeling it
"good" or "bad" or anything like that.
The thing is, I have noticed
some odd goings-on in Whoville lately.
Good "odd goings-on"?
Well, you know, tremors,
clouds swirling in the sky.
And it seems to me, just to be safe,
we might want to consider
postponing the Who-Centennial.
Consider what?
Postponing the Who-Centennial.
What? Speak up, man!
Postponing the Who-Centennial! All right?
We are about to celebrate 100 years
of Whoville happiness and harmony,
and you want to postpone the celebration?
Well, what if Whoville's not safe?
Nothing ever goes wrong in Whoville,
never has and never will,
you blathering boob!
The Who-Centennial will proceed
as planned!
The Mayor was merely being an idiot.
It will be all smiles from now on.
That hurt!
Girl, I got 15,000 friends already.
What? What do you mean,
it don't look like me?
That looks just like me 10 years ago.
Wait a minute. Hold on for a second.
Treats me like an idiot. I am not an idiot.
Do I look like an idiot?
- You don't want me to answer that.
- I am not an idiot.
Has the nerve to call me a boob?
I would never call somebody a boob.
He's a boob! Look at you.
Yuck!
Look at your face.
And I bet you don't look so good
with a stapler in your head!
Whoa! Whoa.
- Thank you, Miss Yelp.
- You're welcome.
Hello?
Who said that? Back off! I'll punch you!
Hello?
Hello.
<i>Who's there?</i>
This is the Mayor.
The Mayor? The Mayor!
I'm talking to the Mayor!
I knew it. I knew it. I knew it.
I knew there was life on this speck.
"This speck"? What speck?
Well, I don't exactly know
how to tell you this, but...
<i>You're living on a speck.</i>
Well, I hate to disagree with you,
O voice from the drainpipe,
but I live in Whoville.
Well, then, Whoville's a speck.
<i>Right.</i>
Okay, seriously, who is this?
Is this Burt from accounting?
No. This is Horton. I'm an elephant.
Okay, "Horton."
Fake name. Where are you?
<i>Well, from where you're standing,</i>
<i>I guess I'm in the sky.</i>
Compared to you, I'm enormous.
Which is saying something,
because I've slimmed down quite a bit.
I swim.
Your whole world fits on a flower
in my world.
Oh, man, this is even pushing it
for you, Burt.
Don't believe me? Watch what happens
when I put you in the shade.
This is absolutely impossible...
<i>Dark.</i>
Light.
<i>Dark.</i>
Light. Dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light, dark.
<i>Light!</i>
Don't you see?
<i>We're in the middle of some kind of</i>
<i>amazing cosmic convergence.</i>
<i>Two vastly different worlds,</i>
<i>miraculously crossing paths!</i>
Mine, colossal! Yours, miniscule.
Yet somehow we've managed
to make contact.
<i>If you think about it, it's pretty amazing.</i>
Is everything okay down there?
I don't know. You tell me.
You're the one holding the speck.
I'm the one holding the speck.
I'm the one holding the speck.
<i>Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor.</i>
Hold, please!
<i>What did all of this mean?</i>
<i>The Mayor hadn't a clue.</i>
<i>So he ran to the office of Dr. Larue,</i>
<i>the brainiest brain on the staff at Who U.</i>
Dr. Larue!
This is crazy.
Mr. Mayor.
How may I be of assistance?
I don't know. Hey, you know,
I was just wondering
if our world were, say, a tiny speck
floating through space,
how would we know?
Well, why would you ask
something like that?
No reason. No reason at all.
I don't even remember.
Yes, I do. You know what?
Some guy was talking to me.
Not an elephant in the sky.
A guy on the ground.
There would be several ramifications.
Good ramifications?
A tiny speck?
Yeah. Tiny speck.
Floating around.
Well, we'd have inexplicable tremors,
dramatic changes in the weather,
and if we didn't eventually achieve
some sort of stability,
our world would be destroyed!
Destroyed? Destroyed. Oh, destroyed.
Horton!
<i>No, this is Benny.</i>
Horton is busy right now.
No. I'm joking.
<i>That's me.</i>
We're doomed.
Listen, Horton, turns out
I need your help a little bit.
Apparently, if that speck
keeps moving around,
our whole world could be obliterated.
So I need you to find us Whos
a safer, more stable home,
and fast.
No problem, Mr. Mayor. Let's see...
Wow, that's a nice view.
Hello. Is everything okay?
What's going on up there?
This entire jungle is a house of death!
Oh, wait. There's a good spot.
<i>And it's then Horton saw</i>
<i>at the top of Mount Nool,</i>
<i>a small cave that looked peaceful</i>
<i>and quiet and cool,</i>
<i>where a sunflower grew proud and tall</i>
<i>from the ground.</i>
<i>There, he knew every Who would be safe,</i>
<i>would be sound.</i>
I found it, Mayor. The perfect place.
Right up there,
<i>- on the top of Mount Nool.</i>
- Mr. Mayor?
<i>I wish you could...</i>
Shiny.
The Who-Centennial Committee
is waiting for you
to look over the giant meatball
for the Edible Parade.
And then you're due at the dentist
for your Who-root canal.
You know, sticking "Who" in front
of everything doesn't make it hurt less.
Just wastes time!
I don't want to go.
Listen, Horton, I've gotta go.
Apparently, there's a problem
with the giant meatball.
You just take care of that meatball, sir,
and leave the freaking out to me.
<i>So then Horton began</i>
<i>his long, perilous trek,</i>
<i>determined to save the small world</i>
<i>on the speck.</i>
<i>Horton was faithful and stalwart and kind.</i>
I got you.
<i>He was a brave hero...</i>
I'll protect you!
<i>... at least in his mind.</i>
We must become invisible. Travel silently.
For there are forces
that would seek to destroy us.
So you think you can sneak up
on me, huh?
It is clear that you are no match
for my technique.
I see you have mastered the way of the
snapping branch. Watch me tumble!
Morton Mouse, go!
You are fast, Horton,
but the Kangaroo has monkeys.
I will make monkeys of these monkeys.
It is their destiny.
More clover!
Horton is the greatest hero of them all!
- Horton!
- Morton!
Go!
But Mount Nool is that way.
To the top of Mount Nool!
As fast as lightning! Away, I go.
Sorry, little fellow.
You'll be fine. Just think healing thoughts.
- Horton! Look!
- Horton! Look, look, look!
We've all got our own clovers
with worlds on them!
Yeah.
In my world, everyone's a pony,
and they all eat rainbows
and poop butterflies.
That's beautiful, Katie.
In a really weird way.
My world is called Jessica-land,
and everyone worships Queen Jessica
because Jessica is so beautiful.
Jessica, that was awesome.
- Rudy!
- Mom, be careful!
My best friend Thidwick lives on that.
Rudy, no one lives on this.
It's not possible.
That Horton is a menace.
Mom, Mom! Please, you're so weird.
Don't do this to me.
Honey, go to your room.
Horton!
It's good!
What do you think you're doing?
You guys with worlds are in trouble!
- Have you forgotten what we discussed?
- Oh, no. I'm an elephant,
and elephants never forget.
It's a curse, really.
I remember I was on my head,
and you said "Humpf,"
and I looked up, and you said,
"What are you doing?"
And I said the thing about the speck.
Then you pulled my ears
and you poked me in the forehead...
- Horton!
- Well, you did.
Give me that clover, Horton. Now!
No.
No?
Yeah.
Are you sure you want to fight
this fight, Horton?
Because I promise you
it will get very ugly, very fast.
And you need to ask yourself,
"Do I really want
to put myself through all this?
"For a clover?"
Take it from me, Horton.
You don't.
So hand it over!
No! I can't give it to you.
There are people on this speck.
Granted, they're very small people,
but a person's a person,
no matter how small.
You just crossed the line, Horton,
and I'm gonna make you pay.
That Horton is a menace.
He has those kids using
their imaginations.
It's sick.
All right, I gotta get this speck
up to the top of Mount Nool, ASAP,
whatever that means. Probably,
"Act Swiftly, Awesome Pachyderm."
I mean, how hard can that be?
It's just a straight plummet
to certain death.
This looks kind of precarious.
Well, no need to worry.
Obviously, when they build a bridge
like this,
they take into account
that elephants will be crossing here.
All right. Feels good.
I'll just get the feel of it!
That's true.
Oh, God.
Hello. And how are we today, Mr. Mayor?
Say, "Ah."
Rinse, please.
I think a few of these boards could
stand to be replaced.
I just need to think light.
I'm light as a feather.
I'm light as a feather!
Heavy feather.
Okay, this will just pinch a little.
I'm lighter than a feather.
What's lighter than a feather?
Air! There's nothing lighter.
So it stands to reason
that the more air I have,
the lighter I'll be.
Next, please.
All right, that was absolutely terrifying.
If I just pull myself up!
Try not to panic.
That could've been a disaster.
Wow. I feel really good right now.
Maybe it's my new sense of purpose.
All right.
Hey, JoJo! I need your help.
Can you help me?
Okay, great. Okay.
First, I need you to go to the girls' room.
Take down Hanna's china doll collection
and then...
Stop looking at my arm.
Put away Holly's light bulb collection,
and then...
You know what? Just take care of
anything that might break or shatter.
Okay, take a good long look.
Got it? Thanks, JoJo!
Here. And... Take that. And...
Hi. You're home late.
Sorry, hon. I was just having some
dental work done on my arm.
So, what was...
Ned!
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
Well, I'm no detective, Ned,
but you are hanging from the chandelier.
I just thought it might look better
somewhere it can't fall on us
and crush us in our sleep.
What is going on?
Hey, hon,
did you ever get the feeling
that you were being watched?
Yeah, sure. I suppose.
And then you get the feeling that
maybe that thing watching you is
a giant elephant?
And you know how
you get that weird feeling
that your world is actually a tiny speck?
And that the elephant that I talked about
earlier is carrying it around on a flower.
And you realize that if you tell anybody,
they'd think you were crazy.
But you still feel a responsibility
to keep everyone safe.
You know that feeling?
You know, I'm gonna have to say no.
Do you know that feeling?
No.
Yawn. Wow. I am beat.
Time to hit the hay, I guess.
Sweetheart, I know
you're under a lot of stress,
and if you're seeing elephants
and flowers, then fine.
Just don't tell anyone else
that story, okay?
And remember,
it's not the end of the world.
"The end of the world."
Horton to Mayor. Horton to Mayor.
Come in, Mayor. Over.
Horton?
I get terrible reception here.
How about this?
If I get up real close, can you read me?
Yep! Roger that.
Are we at that safe place yet?
Almost. I'm pretty sure
the worst part's over.
This is your elephant speaking.
Just sit back, enjoy the ride, and
we'll have you to Mount Nool in no time.
No, you can't have ice cream for breakfast.
- Please.
- Please.
Who's that?
<i>Is there someone else there?</i>
Well, that's my wife and kids.
You have a family.
I do, indeed. A beautiful wife,
96 daughters, and one son.
Oh, busy guy.
And we all share one bathroom.
You know how that is.
Yeah. Don't I know it.
Bathroom?
- Ned!
- What?
Sweetheart, you know
you're on the roof, right?
- Please, Mom.
- What's that?
No, you need to go to bed.
Daddy's having a breakdown.
Ned, what are you up to now?
I was just about to put the kids to bed
when I got off the roof.
And that's what happened. Right.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
- Can I have a glass of water?
- Of course.
- Me, too.
- Me, three.
Me, 28.
Okay.
Hey, JoJo!
A lot of liquid. A lot of liquid.
Just the person I wanted to see.
Yeah, I realize that we have not
been seeing eye-to-eye lately,
and most of it is my fault.
It's true.
You know what I've been trying to do?
I have been trying to impose
my vision of your future on you.
Let me make this perfectly clear.
JoJo, you can be whatever
kind of Mayor you want to be.
Hands-on, strong and silent,
outspoken, it's up to you.
Well, good. I feel so much better.
I am expecting big things from you,
young man. Big things.
All right. Good night.
Good stuff. Good talk.
<i>Then JoJo snuck out,</i>
<i>feeling lonely and sad,</i>
<i>and tragically misunderstood by his dad.</i>
<i>And where was he going</i>
<i>at such a late hour?</i>
<i>Up to Whoville's abandoned</i>
<i>Star-Studying Tower,</i>
<i>a place where the boy felt contented, free.</i>
<i>A place he could be what he wanted to be.</i>
<i>And what was inside there,</i>
<i>I'd say if I could.</i>
<i>But up above, the Kangaroo</i>
<i>was up to no good.</i>
Can I come out now, Mom?
No, Rudy.
Stay in the room.
- But, Mom?
- Stay inside.
Mr. Vladicoff
Eating, go.
Yes. I - I realize you're busy,
but I need your help.
It's Horton.
He's become obsessed with a clover.
And he get actually thinks
there are little people on it.
I want that clover destroyed.
Sure, what a good deal this is,
for you, bro.
I'd do it myself,
but being a lady,
I prefer not to get my hands dirty.
But I hear you have no problem with that.
No.
No problem.
Easy peasy.
But...
I would only do this for a price.
In exchange for a practical payment.
No.
- This...
- little kangaroo.
- Mom?!
Quiet, Rudy.
Mommy is thinking it over.
We'll thanks but, on second thought
I think I'm going to have
the Wickersham Brothers
take care of this for me.
Of course, the Wickersham Brothers.
I mean they're a quasi operation.
You know, they'd...
Wait! No!
You can't go to Wickersham.
No. No. No no no, the Wickershams
would be perfect for this job.
But, they are monkeys,
that's not scary.
Ah, thanks anyway,
maybe next time.
Wait!
Here is what I will do
to the precious clover.
I will take it,
I will crush it,
I will devour it.
Bigger than it looked.
One second.
Holy Moly.
Then, I will regurgitate it.
Then...
I can I devour it
second time.
So two times devour.
Sounds nice.
But I think I'll talk to the Wickershams.
Wait.
Here is best part.
I do all that...
gratis.
That's free bro.
What do you think?
- Deal.
- Yes. Score. Thanking you.
You won't regret.
Mayor?
Mayor?
Open up, Mr. Mayor!
Mr. Mayor!
It's snowing in the summer!
Yes.
Yes, it is.
It's a dramatic change in the weather.
As if we're on a speck floating in space.
I don't know how you knew,
but somehow, you did.
And Whoville is headed for... disaster.
- Oh, Horton.
- What?
Ah, nothing. I'm on it.
It's up to us to save
the people of Whoville.
Snow is not lucky.
That's not... Stop.
O.K.
Anybody else?
Good.
No no. Don't join in.
This is not fun.
Uh, this is a sign of doom.
Oh, sweety, that's...
No. No no no.
It's dangerous.
Stop having fun immediately!
This is dangerous!
O.K.
Horton?
Uh? What?
Hey, there.
We're in big trouble down here.
It's happening.
It's snowing in the middle of summer.
It's the end of the world!
Hold on, Mayor.
I think I know what your problem is.
<i>There. That better?</i>
That seems to have worked.
Do I smell peanuts?
Yeah, they're my favorite snack,
but they tend to linger.
Finwick, no!
Hang on, Mr. Mayor.
I may have to put up a fight.
A frightened elephant can be
very dangerous!
All right!
You've called down the thunder, buddy!
You hungry for trouble? I'm an
"All you can eat" salad bar! Take a bite!
I hate running.
Morton!
Don't do that.
Horton!
Horton! There you are!
We got trouble! Wait, stay, wait!
Did you hear that?
No, I'm here, okay. Listen. No! Go!
Kangaroo has gone nuts, bananas.
She's telling everyone that
you should be kicked out of Nool.
She said that?
I thought we were her friends.
Word is she's gone to Vlad!
Vlad? Vlad? I know two Vlads.
Is it the bad Vlad
or the bunny Vlad that makes the cookies?
Yeah, Horton, she's sending you
a bunny with cookies.
I think we can assume it's the bad Vlad.
Yeah, that's a good call.
So unless you're cool
with giant, razor-sharp claws
ripping the flesh off your body,
I'd get rid of the clover!
I can't! I promised the Mayor.
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant,
and an elephant's faithful, 100%.
Please. For me, just this once.
Be faithful 99% of the time.
I've never gotten 99% on anything,
and I think I'm awesome! So, come on!
I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.
I'm not gonna say it.
You can do that all day,
it's not happening.
An elephant's faithful, 100%.
That's right. That's my code, my motto.
But thanks for the warning.
Motto. Okay.
But watch the skies.
Keep watching the skies!
Mayor, you need to get
everyone underground.
Now!
<i>I don't want to sound the alarm,</i>
<i>but there's a good possibility</i>
<i>we may be attacked</i>
- by a giant carnivorous bird.
<i>- What?</i>
There's a small chance it could be a bunny
with cookies, but I wouldn't count on it.
They are formidable.
<i>Mayor? Are you there?</i>
Yeah. No. That's a great idea. It's just...
In order to get everyone mobilized,
I'd need the okay of the City Council,
and they never listen to me.
I've been called a boob,
several times. I can't do it!
You have to talk to them, Mayor!
Okay. Listen.
Bad Vlad!
Bad Vlad!
Bad Vlad!
That is definitely not a bunny.
Lost him. Meant to lose him,
and I lost him. Good.
Is this tree for real? Come on!
Hang on, Whoville!
This is gonna get rough!
Now you're going to get it!
Get ready for the best!
Leave me alone!
Horton!
I just know he's gonna
jump out somewhere.
Hello.
Chess mate.
Now it's time for me to take clover
and crush all the little people on it,
who are saying...
Sorry. This is where we get off.
Right in the beak!
Cool line. Usually I can't think
of those things till later.
<i>- Mayor?</i>
- Horton.
Are you okay?
Well, more or less. What happened?
The bird?
Yeah, it attacked me.
Mayor, your people are in danger.
You know what? I'm gonna do it.
I'm going to go out there
and tell them what is going on.
Perfect. Now, quick. Get going.
Hey! Mr. Mayor! Something's wrong!
- My basement's in the attic.
- The Science Museum is history.
- The lost and found is missing.
- What's going on, Mr. Mayor?
I'm declaring a state of emergency!
Don't worry! Don't worry!
The Mayor is just being a moron.
No, wait! Whoville is in terrible danger!
Everyone needs to get down to the
underground storage area immediately.
Fine! Fine!
Let's do this democratically.
Who wants the joy and glory and festivity
of the Who-Centennial
to proceed as planned?
Yeah!
And who, like the Mayor,
thinks it would be better
to spend the Who-Centennial
in an underground storage area?
Yeah!
Wait! You've gotta listen to me!
Our whole world could explode!
Much more quickly!
And our world wouldn't make that noise.
The people have spoken, Mr. Mayor.
You're finished. No one believes you.
No one supports you.
Horton believes me.
Horton?
Who's Horton?
Horton is a giant elephant in the sky!
Don't bother looking, he's invisible.
And he's the one risking his life
to get Whoville,
which, by the way,
is a speck on a clover, to safety!
I can prove it!
Horton's voice comes out of this horn.
Horton!
I have all the Whos
gathered in town square!
Let them know you're there!
Gee. This is kind of
a high-pressure situation, then.
Wow. I am really drawing a blank here.
I know!
Horton!
Horton, we're waiting!
Time to show everyone that you exist,
and by extension, what a non-boob I am.
Wait!
Everyone, look at the wind.
What do you think that that means?
It means...
It means, obviously...
Let the kite-flying race begin!
What a burn on you, Horton!
Brain freeze.
Give me back my speck!
Not this time, guy.
I am so sorry that I let you down,
but this... This is bigger than me.
Get the family together
and get somewhere safe.
I will! I believe you.
I've got you now, elephant.
No, no, no!
Oh, no!
Mayor?
Anybody there?
Hello?
Anyone?
<i>But clover by clover by clover, he found</i>
<i>that the one he sought for</i>
<i>was just not around.</i>
Mayor?
Hello?
<i>And by noon, poor Horton,</i>
<i>more dead than alive,</i>
<i>had picked, searched and piled up 9,005.</i>
Hello?
Sorry to bother you,
nobody.
Knock, knock.
This is where you'd say, "Who's there?"
if there were any Whos there.
Get it? "Whos there."
<i>All day he looked, looked on and on,</i>
<i>until his hope was almost gone.</i>
No, no, no! Please, no!
This isn't fair!
<i>But, wait, could this one be the one?</i>
<i>Was all his searching finally done?</i>
<i>Ah, yes, for this was the hour.</i>
<i>Horton had found them</i>
<i>on the three millionth flower.</i>
Mayor! Mayor!
I found you!
Mayor?
Are you there?
Mayor?
Mayor.
<i>Mayor, are you there?</i>
<i>Mayor!</i>
<i>Mayor?</i>
Mayor?
Mayor!
<i>No, this is Floyd.</i>
<i>Can I take a message?</i>
Mayor! You're okay!
Horton! Horton! Stop! Stop it!
Sorry.
<i>It must have been rough down there.</i>
<i>I can't believe I found you.</i>
<i>You really had me worried.</i>
Say! The Mayor was right!
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Okay, I'm all right, and so are you.
Citizens of Whoville!
I'd like you to meet our friend Horton.
He's going to help us!
I've got this.
This is the Chairman...
<i>Idiot!</i>
You're finished in this town!
Is that understood? Finished.
You boob!
I'm just joking.
Good one.
Horton, this is my wife Sally.
You exist!
This means my husband isn't crazy.
Hooray!
And a few of my daughters,
Haley, Holly, Hooly, Hilda and Hedy.
- Hi!
- Hi!
And here is Miss Yelp, my loyal assistant.
- And here's Dr. Larue.
- You saved us!
And Burt from accounting,
<i>and Mrs. McGillicuddy, and Mr. Farfoogan</i>
from the Clugan Farfoogans,
and the old man in the bathtub.
Let's not overwhelm the poor fellow.
<i>He's never gonna remember</i>
<i>all these names.</i>
Well, I'll try my best.
Sally, Chairman,
Haley, Hooly, Holly, Hilda,
Hedy, Miss Yelp,
Dr. Larue, Burt from accounting,
Mrs. McGillicuddy, Mr. Farfoogan
of the Clugan Farfoogans,
and wasn't there an old guy in a shower?
<i>Bathtub.</i>
- Yeah!
<i>- We're all here, Horton,</i>
and we all believe in you.
Wow. That's awesome.
And it's a responsibility
I do not take lightly.
I promise you a future
that is safe, sound and stable.
We will create a world where every Who
is endowed with three inalienable rights,
to be determined at a later date.
And we will put a speck on Mount Nool
before the end of this decade.
This elephant is crazy! Oh, my goodness.
I gotta tell everybody.
I need to get to the Kangaroo.
Wait till they find out about...
You should have been seeing me.
I really let elephant have it.
I chase him, I torment him, I break him
into million little elephant pieces.
It was thing of beauty, really.
My best work. Classic Vlad.
And the clover?
Clover is finished!
No way in million years Horton find it.
Read my beak. Clover is gone forever.
I just saw Horton,
and he is still talking to that clover!
Idiot!
Whoa! Come on, I'm your bro!
It's me you're talking to. We have history!
Come on, let's not forget,
I did this for free!
What is happening to the jungle of Nool?
There once was a time
when people were people
and specks were specks.
Well, I say, "If you can't see it,
hear it or feel it,
"it doesn't exist!"
Our way of life is under attack!
And who is leading that attack? Horton!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute!
This is Horton we're talking about.
You all know him, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
Except for that fly city he sat on.
But he didn't do that on purpose.
Shut up, mouse!
That's weird. My brownies are burning.
I gotta go!
Are we going to let troublemakers like
Horton poison the minds of our children?
Not the children!
When Horton tells our children
about worlds beyond the jungle,
he makes them question authority!
Which leads to defiance!
Which leads to anarchy!
Yeah! Horton must pay!
It's that speck!
We have to do something!
For the children!
For the children!
Are we going to let him
get away with this?
No!
Let's go!
Morton! I told you! 100%!
Horton!
Morton, pick up your feet! Jeez.
It's not me!
I see. It's an angry mob. Sorry, Morton.
I thought it was you
that was making all the...
But it's...
Oh, darn.
Run, Horton!
There he is!
Let's rope him!
Let's cage him!
No! No! No!
Stop!
Hey, fellas. Good to see you,
all at once.
You look really great as a horde.
Horton, Horton, Horton,
look at the mess
you've created for yourself.
All this hullabaloo over a silly little flower.
It's a speck.
Right. I mean, it's silly, really,
all this talk of roping you,
and caging you, and, well,
we don't need to go into the details.
The point is, this angry mob,
all the trouble you're in,
it can all go away.
- Really?
- Of course.
All you have to do is admit to everyone
that there are no little people
living on that speck.
That you were wrong and I was right.
You do that and things can go right back
to the way they were.
But if you don't, you're going to
have to pay the price.
So, I just have to say it isn't true?
Go ahead. Rope me, cage me.
Do whatever you want.
But there are people on this speck.
And they have a Mayor, who has
96 daughters and one son named JoJo,
who all share a bathroom,
whatever that is,
and even though you can't hear
or see them at all,
a person's a person, no matter how small.
That was beautiful, Horton.
Rope him! Cage him!
And burn that speck
in a pot of boiling Beezlenut oil!
They don't believe we're here.
We've got to make some noise!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
Come on!
- Everybody!
- We are here! We are here! We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
This will teach you not to make up stories
about people on specks!
Listen! There they are!
- Rope him.
- Cage him!
It's not working.
I can hear you,
but their ears aren't strong enough.
We need to be louder!
Get every Who to make noise! Everyone!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
JoJo! Where are you going?
We need every voice! JoJo!
You need to make some noise down there,
or we'll all be destroyed!
<i>The Mayor grabbed a tom-tom</i>
<i>and started to smack it,</i>
<i>and all over Whoville,</i>
<i>they whooped up a racket.</i>
<i>They rattled tin kettles!</i>
<i>They beat on brass pans!</i>
<i>On garbage pail tops</i>
<i>and old cranberry cans!</i>
<i>They blew on bazookas</i>
<i>and blasted great toots.</i>
<i>On clarinets, oompahs,</i>
<i>and boompahs, and flutes!</i>
There!
Can they hear us now?
Listen, please.
It's the most beautiful thing ever.
I don't hear nothing!
I don't think so. But keep trying.
I'll never give in!
Are you sure that every Who down
in Whoville is trying?
We are here! We are here!
Where's JoJo?
Probably at the old observatory.
Hey! There's a limit!
That's not supposed to stretch that far!
JoJo!
You built this?
We are here! We are here! We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
You're making a mistake.
But, Mom!
This doesn't concern you, sweetie.
Back in your pouch!
Everybody! Don't stop!
Keep going! This is gonna do it!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
Can they hear?
No!
No matter what happens,
I couldn't ask for a better son.
Hey, JoJo!
Come on! Keep going!
No!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
No!
Yopp!
We are here! We are here! We are here!
I hear it! I hear it!
They are there!
<i>And that Yopp,</i>
<i>that one small extra Yopp put it over,</i>
<i>and all the Who noises</i>
<i>burst out of the clover.</i>
- I hear it!
- Me, too!
Rudy. Give me that! Come...
Rudy. Get back in the pouch. Now!
No, Mom.
Wickershams! Get that clover!
Anybody! Take it from him!
You did it, Mayor. You did it.
We did it!
Yeah!
Well done, son.
All right, Mayor!
Dad, you're one of the greats!
Whoa. Easy, everyone! Easy!
Hi, Vlad.
Well, I shouldn't, but...
Oh, man, that is nice touch.
I am a mess with this, right?
Emotional! Here come the waterslide.
There's so many people to thank.
The good people of Nool,
who put me in a cage
and poked me with sticks.
That was me!
My buddy Morton, for being the only one
who stood by me.
Well, not right by me.
He hid in the bushes,
sending me good thoughts. He's small.
Dude, you are a warrior poet.
And most of all, I'd like to thank
the Mayor of Whoville,
<i>who believed in me from the beginning.</i>
Horton, we're going to miss you.
What are we gonna do
without you, Horton?
Don't worry. I'll always be around.
<i>And even as I wander</i>
<i>I'm keeping you in sight</i>
<i>You're a candle in the window</i>
<i>On a cold, dark winter's night</i>
Beautiful metaphor.
<i>And I'm getting closer</i>
<i>Than I ever thought I might</i>
That's a little high for me.
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>
<i>And if I have to crawl upon your floor</i>
<i>Crawl upon the floor</i>
<i>Come crashing through your door</i>
<i>Crashing through your door</i>
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
<i>I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
<i>And so all ended well,</i>
<i>for both Horton and Whos,</i>
<i>and for all in the jungle, even kangaroos.</i>
<i>So let that be a lesson, to one and to all.</i>
<i>A person's a person,</i>
<i>no matter how small.</i>
<i>And I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
Yeah, I like this. Faster, more up-tempo.
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>
<i>It's time to bring my ship into your shore</i>
That's a metaphor!
<i>And throw away the oar</i>
Another metaphor!
<i>And buy an engine</i>
<i>'Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
<i>From the weight of my trunk to my toes</i>
<i>I've forgotten what I started fighting for</i>
Well, you shouldn't be fighting anything.
Enjoy yourself.
<i>If I have to crawl across the floor</i>
<i>- Now, break down your stupid door</i>
<i>- Crashing through your door</i>
<i>Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore</i>
<i>On an empty stomach</i>
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>
<i>I can't fight this feeling</i>
I'm just saying words.
That felt so good.
Cathartic!
What?
