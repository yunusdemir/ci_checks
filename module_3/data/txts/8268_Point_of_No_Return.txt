What do I gotta do?

You can have me followed.
-Please.
-I can't. Okay?
Look, Maggie...

-Bullshit.
-Yes, I do.
I used to be a recruit myself.
I used to be where you are now.
And, just like you,

-So?
We need a young female operative.
I think she's the one.
Now, under normal circumstances
it takes two years. In this case--
Six months.
That's right. And I don't want to see
any more attitude from her.
Enough with this crap. She bites,
she kicks, she throws food. What is that?

I give you six months. And I want immediate
improvement or she gets a bullet in the brain.

Or are you afraid that I'll revert and start
putting my feet back up on the table again?
I think that, uh...
...tonight we should have dinner out.
Really?
Oh, thank you.
Shall we go?
Good evening. Would you like

Uh, no, thanks.

That's true. That's true.
But most other guys are just out

Well, he may not be the youngest,

So....
How old are you, Uncle Bob?
I'm, um, 37.

you were like when you were a little girl.
J.P., you promised.

-Do I ask you questions?

No, I wish you would, though.
-Can't we just drop it?
J.P.: Why don't we not this time.
Look, damn it! Don't you fucking get it?
I don't want to talk about it!
I didn't drag my ass all the way from the
gutter in Kansas City to take shit from you!
[J.P. SIGHS]
I thought you were from Chicago.
Uh, Kansas City.
She was born in Kansas City
but, uh, raised in Chicago.
I used to see her during the summers
on this farm that my uncle owned.
You didn't know
she spent summers on a farm, did you?
Well, she did.
I remember--
I remember one summer...
...the, uh, local kids-- Thanks.
--the kids' family owned this, uh, mare.
She was...
...black as a raven's wing, completely wild.
Remember? They called her Beauty.
She was, uh, trained as a trotter,
but she had never really been ridden.
Anyway, the kids told Claudia
that she had to ride Beauty...
...that it was like an initiation,
the kind of thing that they all had to do.
Anyway, one day, I remember...
...about noon...
...it was really, really hot.
We heard this scream.
We ran outside, and--
And there was Claudia.
Claudia...
...bareback on this wild horse.
Well, the horse went completely crazy.
Bucked, reared.
She hung on.
She just gritted her teeth,
dug her heels in...
...and she hung on.
And, by God, she rode that horse.
I guess that's how
I remember her, really.
This slip of a girl on a wild black horse.
She was so beautiful.
She was so beautiful that she gleamed.
Do you know what I mean?
That's really you, then.
That's what I thought you'd be like.
By the way...
...did, uh, Claudia tell you what I do?
J.P.:
No.
I'm in the travel business.
Well, I'm a partner in a travel agency...
...and I've got these two tickets here,
if, uh, you'd like to take them.
They're for New Orleans
for the Mardi Gras.

You're so sweet.

We gotta go!
Yeah!
Whoa!
MAGGIE:
Hey.
Let's go to the hotel.
Wait. Let's try here.
Try here.
Yeah. Down here.
MAGGIE:
Can't we just eat here?
J.P.: The food is crappy.
I know that place is close by here.
MAGGIE:
You better be right.
[FIRECRACKERS BANGING]
J.P.:
Well, it might be that, uh....
It's, uh....
Oh, yeah. I saw it over here.
[MAGGIE LAUGHING]
[FIRECRACKERS BANGING]
[SPEAKING IN CREOLE]
What do you want?
[SPEAKING IN CREOLE]
We want your money.
Maybe y'all could help us out
with a little something to eat, huh?
Me and my friend, we real hungry now.
Real good. We want all your money.
J.P.: Go to hell.
THUG: Hey....
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Come on.
J.P.: So wild. What the hell was that?
-I don't know.
You beat the hell out of them.
You didn't even give me a chance.
It was just a reflex.
You've got some reflexes.
Where'd you learn to do that?
MAGGIE:
Well, I, uh....
I-- I took-- Ha, ha.
I just-- I don't know.
I guess I took a self-defense class once
when I was just a girl.
[MAGGIE LAUGHS]
I'm so hungry.
[MAGGIE LAUGHS]
I gotta have food.
-What is it? It's 5, right?
-Mm-hm.
[LAUGHS]
WOMAN: Room service. May I help you?
-Hello?
Hi, uh-- Ha-ha-ha! Oh!
-This is Room 30.
-Uh-huh?
Yeah. Um, uh....
-I'd like to order some food, please.
-All right. Go ahead.
Could I-- Could I have, um, uh,
a couple of chicken salads...
...and a couple of pieces of pecan pie...
...and, um, also what kind of soda
do you have?
-We have light--
-Oh.
Okay. All right, well, then,
I guess I'll have the, um....
[LAUGHS]
I'll take Pepsi.
Could I have four bottles of that or cans or
whatever because we get thirsty after sex.
[LAUGHS]
-Okay.
-Okay.
MAGGIE:
Kiss my neck.
J.P.:
Okay.
Kiss it harder.
[PHONE RINGING]
[MAGGIE GROANS]
[MAGGIE LAUGHS]
-Yes?
AGENT: Nina?
Yes?
The bathroom cabinet
has a hidden compartment.
All-- All right.
Then make it two pieces
of chocolate rum cake.
They're all out of pecan pie.
Okay, we're out of this joint.
Uh, I gotta take a bath. I feel really dirty.
Just if you could just wait
for room service, please.
[WATER RUNNING]
Nina in position.
AGENT [ON RADIO]:
First item's under the sink.
[WATER RUNNING]
-Assembly completed.
-Open the window.
-There's no handle.
-Open the window.
-Claudia?
-Yeah?
J.P.:
You know what I've been thinking?
What?
J.P.:
I've got a really good idea.
MAGGIE:
What?
Just thinking we could make Bob's present
an engagement present.
Save the poor slob some money.
Okay.
What do you say, you wanna do it?
Make it formal?
Honey?
AGENT:
The limousine.
Take aim on the limousine.
We're waiting for further instructions.
I asked you a question.
Don't you think I deserve an answer?
In a minute.
[CHUCKLES]
Just how I always imagined it.
Proposing through a door.
Claudia?
[SOBBING]
Christ, what is it with you?
Can you say something.
Say, "Go to hell, J.P."
Tell me you love me...
...or "get lost" or whatever.
Just answer me, okay?
[SOBBING]
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
MAN [OUTSIDE]:
Room service.
-How many targets?
AGENT: One.
-What's he look like?
-I haven't been informed yet.
-How y'all enjoying beautiful Mardi Gras?
-Real well. Thanks.
AGENT:
Target visible in five seconds.
-Thanks. Sure.
-Y'all come back and see us, you hear?
Which one is it?
AGENT:
I don't have that data yet.
So you got nothing to say to me, huh?
Which target, damn it?
AGENT:
The woman.
The woman in white.
J.P.:
Claudia.
AGENT:
The woman in white, I said.
Claudia.
[BANGING ON DOOR]
AGENT:
The fucking woman!
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
What gives with you?
What the hell's going on?
What's this?
So you got nothing to say to me?
A while ago, I did something really bad.
And I came through it,
but I'm always gonna be paying for it.
Okay, it's okay.
It's in the past. You can just let it go.
I can't.
But you've got to believe me.
If I'm secretive...
...I've got my reasons.
For now, I'll take that.
But for now.
[DOOR CLOSES]
[SOBBING]
INSTRUCTOR: Students, this is
a defensive tactic. Watch me.
Kick. Punch.
So how was New Orleans?
Everything you touch turns to shit.
Why would you send me on a job with J.P.?
What happens to him if he finds out?
Listen, Maggie, I know
it wasn't an easy job.
You're so pathetic. Listen to you.
You stand there with that little smile.
Drop the fucking mask for once.
-Listen, Maggie.
-Fuck you! That was my last job.
You stupid, ignorant little girl.
Do you think you can decide
you don't want to play anymore?
I mean, where the fuck
do you think you are?
Christ, haven't you heard anything
that I've said?
-I mean it.
-You don't know.
-I'm through! I'm out!
-Which word do you not understand?
There is no out. There is no through.
There is no out!
Bob, you gotta help me.
I can't do this.
I can't live like this anymore.
Don't you like me
well enough to help me?
Like you?
[SCOFFS]
I know...
...you like that you made me
into something different.
But you're not looking close enough.
I am different.
Help me be better.
Please, Bob, let me go.
You know who Fahd Bahktiar is?
He's one of the richest men in the world.
Right now he's peddling
nuclear information to the Middle East.
I need a woman for this one, Maggie.
It's the kind of job you were trained for.
I want you to do three things.
Number one: Impersonate his girlfriend
so you can get into his house.
Two: Take the disk that he's been sending
the data on, and then destroy his computer.
And number three:
I want you to take him out.
If I do this job, if I bring this off...
...will you do what you can
to help me get out?
No.
AMANDA:
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Would you take these, John? Thanks.
Maggie! What a pleasure!
How are you?
Does anybody ever get out?
Thank you, John. I'll do the rest.
Were you like me once?
Would they let you leave if you wanted to?
Happiness in life comes from braiding
together what one would like to have...
...with what is inevitable.
Stop that shit.
Stop talking like that and answer me!
[TRAY THUNKS]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't want to be rude to you.
You were the only one who was nice to me.
Just please, could you tell me?
Could you just leave if you wanted to?
Just get on a plane and disappear?
To tell the truth, dear...
...I don't know. It's a possibility
that never entered my mind.
You won't tell Bob I came?
Thank you.
-Oh. You look tired.
-Ha, ha. I am.
-You want a back rub?
-Yeah.
-With the hypnotic fantasy oil?
-Yeah.
All right.
-On the bed.
-Oh.
-I'll be right back.
-Good.
[GASPS]
Hello, Maggie.
These are copies of the photographs
I gave you.
Amanda says that you, uh....
Ahem. That you dropped them.
I don't think I can do it.
If you pull this job off for me...
...I'll see what I can do to help you.
See the, uh, upstairs corner?
That's his bedroom. Right here.
You arrive early. You do it here. Okay?
With the right wig, clothes,
attitude, you can, uh...
...look sufficiently like the girlfriend
to get into his house.
What happens to her?
Does she die, too?
Absolutely not.
No unnecessary wetworks.
Good.
BETH: Okay. Look at those earrings.
Look at the bop in the walk. It's that thing.
MAGGIE:
I have those glasses.
BETH: Yeah? Great.
-I'll get that brand of cigarettes.
-Yeah. She's right-handed.
MAGGIE: I'm right-handed.
BETH:
Long cigarettes.
Is that mole real?
Not on me, it won't be.
Here we go again.
[ALL SINGING "HAPPY BIRTHDAY"]
[ALL LAUGHING]
[ALL CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
They don't go out!
[MOCKING TONE]
It won't go out.
Oh. Baby.
It's heavy. It's heavy.
[BOTH IMITATING]
It's heavy.
Get out of the way now.
-Get out of the way now.
BETH: She wearing enough makeup?
Hello, my darling.
-There he is.
-Yeah.
[ALL LAUGHING]
Oh, Frank, for Christ's sake,
do us all a favor and put the camera away.
All right.
[STOPS TAPE]
-Let's go over it again.
-Phew. Oh, God.
-Christ, we've only done it 20 times.
-I know but...
...it's tomorrow night.
This is our last chance.
Okay. We meet at 4:00 to go to Angela's.
Okay, maybe we should
make it a quarter to.
-Okay, that'll give us more time.
-Hi.
Hey, honey.
[TV SWITCHES OFF]
Uncle Bob? Uncle Bob, is it really you?
How nice to see you.
No, it can't be Uncle Bob.
It's got to be, uh...
...Aunt Pauline or, uh, Cousin Molly
there or something, right?
Wait a minute. I got it.
This must be Cindy D'Amato. Used to
work for Super Mac. Quit to get married.
Hi, Cindy. Sorry about this.
How the hell are you?
[DOOR CLOSES]
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
What in heaven's name
have you got there?
WOMAN: You bought it for me, remember?
When I moved into the studio.
-Give me that nonsensical object. Give it--
-You keep away from me.
MAN:
Don't you try to intimidate me.
You're not going to tell Carol.
-Swear me you won't!
-I'll swear nothing.
[GUNSHOT]
[DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]
-Hi.
-Hi.
We're from Sherry's.
Where's Francine?
-Francine's sick today, so Sherry sent us.
-They said Francine was coming.
Well, I guess they got it wrong
because Francine's sick. I don't know.
Sherry sent us because
Francine ate something bad or something.
She got sick.
Look, mister, I could really care less
if I did another head of hair today.
So make up your mind.
All right. Come on.
Who are these people?
Where's Francine?
Francine's sick, so we're here.
Great. Some new fucking blood.
Can you do me out here?
-Sure. I can burn hair anywhere.
MAID: Is this outfit all right, ma'am?
-The stain, is it gone?
MAID: Yes.
Fine. Put it in my room
with the red boots.
I want some fucking softness
around my face.
Last time Francine did me,
she slicked all my hair back...
...and made me look like
some kind of fucking dyke.
Did you guys meet my friends?
This is "Stupid"
and the other one is "Stupider."
[ANGELA & MAGGIE CHUCKLE]
-Would you like some ginseng tea?
-No, I don't drink tea.
Francine says you'll love her ginseng tea.
It's great for the sex drive.
Well, I've got no trouble
in that department.
It's really very good.
Enough with the fucking tea,
for Christ's sake.
Suit yourself.
-Do you have silk, please, for my fingers?
-I sure do.
[MUFFLED GRUNTING]
Hey! Hey!
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
[SCREAMS]
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
BETH:
Oh, God, I'm dead. God! Aah.
-Let me see.
-Oh, damn it, I'm hit.
MAGGIE: It's okay.
-Unh. Ah.
MAGGIE: Here. Here. All right, hold still.
Hold still. Just push it hard.
I'm calling Kaufman.
-I'm calling Kaufman.
-I can finish it. No! I have to!
He said if anything goes wrong,
we're supposed to call him.
[DIALING PHONE]
Okay, it's screwed up.
There are two down and I'm hit.
How?
Okay, okay. Yes, okay.
Okay.
They're calling in a cleaner.
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
[ELEVATOR DINGS]
Uh, excuse me, but we've heard reports
of shots. Have you heard anything?
[SILENCED GUNSHOTS]
I'm Victor. I'm the cleaner.
Uh, listen, the job's gone really bad,
but I think I can finish it.
This part of the job's over.
I'm the cleaner.
Where's the material?
MAGGIE:
Outside.
What the hell is that for?
Cleaning up your shit.
[BODY HISSING]
Jesus Christ, what're you doing?
[ANGELA COUGHING]
She's not dead.
Oh, God. Oh, God, okay.
Kaufman said no wetworks. He said
no wetworks. I'm calling Kaufman now.
[SILENCED GUNSHOT]
I never did mind about the little things.
I'll go get ready for the next step.
-You look nice.
-Thank you.
All right, have a nice evening.
[INTERCOM RINGING]
Hi, Angela. New driver?
[AS ANGELA] For Christ's sake, give me
a break and open the stupid gate.
It went off the tracks,
and I called in a cleaner.
What happened?
Two down. I was afraid we'd get splashed
with shit. I told him to get it cleaned up.
-How clean?
-Down to the nap.
The cleaner's going
with your girl to Bahktiar's.
And after she finishes...
...he'll clean her too.
MAGGIE [AS ANGELA]: Of course
it was me. I heard the bloody thing.
He's upstairs. You're early.
-So sue me, stupid.
-You want a drink?
Salty Dog. Leave it down here.
I must piss.
Hello, my da--
Go to your computer,
bring up your nuclear program.
What do you think are you going to
accomplish by this?
Do it!
Suck my dick.
[YELLS]
[BAHKTIAR GROANS]
Go to your computer.
[GROANS]
You think the Arabs should be the only
people not to have this technology?
Is that what you think?
Hurry up.
-I cannot access the data.
-Yeah, right.
-The system must be down.
-Get around to the other side of the desk.
I can make you very rich,
beyond anything you can imagine.
And if I say I will, I will.
I'll do it, I promise.
What's the password?
What's the password?
Try to imagine what a bullet
in the stomach feels like.
Peddler.
[TYPES KEYS]
MAN:
Hey.
You can't park there.
Move it around back with the other cars.
Hey! Are you deaf? Move the car!
[ENGINE STARTS]
[GRUNTS]
[YELLS]
[BEEPING]
On the ground.
Don't be a stupid bitch. I'm offering
you anything. Anything you want.
Get on your knees, forehead to the ground,
hands behind your back.
You think killing me will solve anything?
Do you think you can keep 800 million
people in the 14th century forever?
Do you think there's not
a thousand more to sell this technology...
...to anyone for a price,
or do you not think?
Do you just kill for money?
[BOTH GRUNTING]
Hassan! Imshi! Imshi!

Is there--?
Is there a woman down there?
There could be 20 women down there,

That's it.
MAGGIE:
J.P.
You awake?
I know you are.
I can tell by the way you're breathing.
Oh, I'm so tired.
J.P.:
My God.
What happened to your face?
She's gone.
Oh, yeah?
Where?
I don't know.
She took off empty-handed.
She didn't take any of her clothes,
she didn't even her purse.
So whoever it is you are...
...just leave her alone. Let her go.
-I can't. She's got information.
-Yeah.
Why don't you get out?
[BOB SCOFFS]
J.P.:
She left you a note.
Yeah?
I tore it up.
What did it say?
