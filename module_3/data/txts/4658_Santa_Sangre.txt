Fenix.
Please...
Eat like a human being.
Grr!
You can't just stay here all the time,
not seeing anyone.
Now come on, stand up.
Come on now. Your foot.
That's it.
The other one.
Don't miss the Circo del Gringo,
the greatest show on earth!
The death-defying trapeze girl!
The boy magician!
Come and see them now! Come on!
See the tiger from the Indian jungle!
The elephant from darkest Africa!
The furry monkey! Roll up! Roll up!
Go and see the Circo del Gringo!
Aladin, the world's smallest
elephant trainer! Roll up! Roll up!
Roll up! Roll up! Come and see...
Papa! Wake up, wake up! They're here!
Get the hell out of here!
I told you not to bother me!
Why does he drink so much?
My mother says
he killed a woman in America.
And he can't go back?
Tough life. Come on,
let's go see the new act.
- The new act?
- Yes!
The Tattooed Woman!
Now come on.
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Don't be afraid!
Come on!
You can't do anything!
Read my lips, you stupid deaf-mute.
Come on, don't just stand there!
I should have left you in the poorhouse
when your mother died. Now practice!
Or I'll beat you.
What's goin' on here?
Oh, Mr Orgo.
Here I am.
Hmm.
Ahh!
- The ocean!
- Oh!
- Ooh!
- It's a peacock!
- Ooh!
- It's the moon.
- Here's a fish!
- Cloud.
- And a crab!
- The ocean!
Ooh!
Nice to meet you.
Come with me.
- Against the board.
- Anything you say, Mr Orgo.
Ohh! Ah!
Blasphemy! Idiots!
Sacrilege!
Mother! Mother!
Blasphemy! This is our church!
All right, get them off my land right now
or I'll run 'em over!
Go ahead - but you'll have to kill us all!
Go ahead!
- Then go ahead!
- Mother!
No!
No! Don't hurt her!
We are not afraid of you.
♫ El fin del mundo se acerca ya
♫ Toda esperanza se acabará
♫ Ya las señales se están cumpliendo
♫ Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
♫ Querido amigo, Lirio te llama
♫ No hagas duro tu corazón
♫ Ríndete a Lirio, dale tu alma
♫ Y tendrás parte en la resurrección ♫
Peace! I bring peace.
- Come now.
- Father.
Peace.
Please, Father, help us.
They want to destroy our temple.
I won't let them do such a thing.
Peace. Peace. Let me see your church.
This is it, Monsignor.
This is where we worship...
our beloved saint and martyr.
Here she is, Monsignor.
But... this is no saint.
Monsignor, she is a saint.
How could you?
Right here, many years ago,
Lirio, a young girl, was attacked
by the Terrano brothers.
She tried to fight them off
with all her strength
but they cut off her arms.
They raped her
and left her to die in a pool of blood.
And on this ground, miraculously
still wet with her holy blood,
we built our church.
- This is paint!
- No, it's holy blood.
- This is paint!
- It's holy blood!
Do you hear me, crazy woman? It's paint!
- It's blood! It's blood!
- Feel it! Feel it!
This is paint! It is paint! This is paint!
Holy blood! It's holy blood!
It's holy blood!
- It's paint!
- Holy blood.
I order you to stop...
this foolish sacrilege... immediately.
Never! This is our saint!
The church will never
recognise... this heresy!
Don't dare! Holy blood!
Cantemos todos!
Holy blood. Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood! Holy blood!
Holy blood!
Holy blood! Holy blood!
Come, Kevin, I don't want this
to soil your pure soul.
- Let's go.
- Yes, go! Get out of here!
Go ahead and destroy this abomination!
Holy blood.
Holy blood!
- Holy blood! Holy blood! Oh!
- Holy blood!
Go ahead!
Don't run away!
Mother! No!
- No, no! No, no!
- No.
Kill me! Go ahead!
Kill me! Kill me!
Kill me!
- Kill me! Go ahead!
- Mother! Mother!
Go ahead...
Hey!
Ahh...
Mr Orgo...
Aah!
Orgo has a decent wife.
Stay away from him -
or I'll kill you!
She's crazy!
Get up. Get up!
You bastard!
Aaah.
Ahh. Ahh.
Aaah.
My little child.
No...
Don't. Don't. Don't laugh!
Don't do that!
Ahh. Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Hah!
Stop! Nobody goes any further.
Leave them alone.
Get out of here. Vamoose. Vamoose.
Vamoose. Vamoose.
- What's happened?
- The elephant is dying.
Please, don't die.
Please.
Don't die.
Stop crying... like a little girl.
I'll give you a charm.
That'll make you a man.
There, now you're a man.
Just like me.
Ladies and gentlemen,
Fenix, the boy magician!
Concha, queen of the flying trapeze!
Hanging by her own hair!
Put me down! Put me down!
Quick, quick! Down! Down!
Quick. Quick.
Go away!
Music! Music!
Concha!
Mummy! Mum!
Shh! Get in the trailer.
Keep quiet. Go! Go...
Come on, come on, come on.
Oh!
♫ Yo ya me voy
♫ Al puerto donde se haya... ♫
♫ La barca de oro... ♫
♫ Que debe conducirme
♫ Yo ya me voy
♫ Sólo vengo a despedirme
♫ Adiós mujer
♫ Adiós para siempre, adiós... ♫
Come on.
♫ No volverán
♫ Tus ojos a mirarme
♫ Ni tus oídos
♫ Escucharán mi canto
♫ Voy a aumentar... ♫
No!
♫ Los mares con mi llanto... ♫
♫ Adiós mujer
♫ Adiós para siempre, adiós ♫
Come here, come on, come on. Come on.
This is Fenix.
Yes.
Give me your hand.
Thanks, Fenix.
Come along now.
Come on, Fenix.
They're around here somewhere.
Now, Fenix. Thank you.
Form a circle!
Good boy, Fenix.
Everybody wave. Hands up like this!
Go on!
Music.
And now... we will have some fruit!
- Come on, let's have some fruit.
- We'll have some fruit!
One for you...
New friends, Fenix.
Rudolph,
Mauricio,
Daniel,
Marcos,
and Darío.
They are going to the movies tonight.
- Yes?
- Yes.
And you are going with them.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Come on, my dear.
Here we are, out you get.
Come on, Daniel. Come on, you two.
- Come on, stay together.
- Come along.
Now we will see a great film
about Robinson Crusoe.
Is everybody here? Come on, Fenix.
Ah, yes. Robinson Crusoe,
one of life's castaways.
Yes. Good boy, Darío.
Goodbye. Goodbye!
I have to go with my grandmother.
Goodbye! We're going to the synagogue.
Hello, little boy. Nice little boy.
Good morning.
I am Robinson Crusoe.
Bye! Enjoy the movie!
And don't worry, we will wait for you.
Come along.
Vengan, vengan.
Come, I have a present for you.
Listen, this kind of stuff
will make you sick.
If you promise not to tell,
I'll take you somewhere else...
that's much more fun than the movies.
A little sniff of this...
And we'll see.
Sniff.
Ándele para adentro.
De la buena!
Yes, yes.
Vamos amigos!
♫ Hai!
♫ Qué le pasa a Lupita?
♫ No sé
♫ Qué le pasa a esa niña?
♫ No sé
♫ Qué es lo que quiere?
♫ Bailar
♫ Por qué ella no baila? ♫
Cagón!
♫ Que dice su mama
♫ Que sí
♫ Que baile Lupita
♫ Sí sí
♫ Mambo, mambo, mambo, mambo...
Sí!
♫ Sí! Sí! Sí!
♫ Aaah!
Here.
There you go, Lores.
How much for the five pendejitos?
For all of them, $20.
Five for you, 15 for me.
Ohh...
Vengan, vengan chaparritos
al hotel.
Mm. Me los voy a comer.
Mira, mira lo que me encontré.
- Like me?
- Mírame!
Mírame, dame un trocito.
♫ Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
♫ Cinco, seis, siete, ocho
♫ Mambo!
♫ Aaah!
♫ Hai! ♫
Ahh...
♫ Hai! ♫
Fenix?
Fenix?
- Have fun last night?
- Mm-hm.
How do you feel?
Good! Very good.
Now eat, hm?
I'll be back later, all right?
All right, out we go. Out we go. Today
we have home-made chicken soup.
Fenix!
Fenix!
♫ Siento en el alma
♫ Unas ganas inmensas
♫ De llorar
♫ Tu me haces falta
♫ Y juré no decírtelo jamás
♫ Yo quiero hacerte
♫ Con mis lágrimas un collar de perlas
♫ Déjame llorar
♫ Porque hoy ya te perdí
♫ Queriéndote olvidar
♫ Me acuerdo más
♫ De ti ♫
Ahh!
Inside.
Come on.
Sit over there!
Ah!
If I can get a proper drink...
Oh! Hup!
- Come here, now.
- Give me that, brother.
Hey, come over, baby. Come on.
Yeah.
- Ahh!
- I'll give you another tattoo, baby!
Where is his girl?
- Where's his money?
- First he's gotta see what he's payin' for.
Ah!
She's a deaf-mute
so you can do whatever you want
with her and no one will hear her.
Oh...
Aah!
Amiga, adónde vas?
Now, when she comes back, I'm gonna
take care of you! You little bitch!
Oh, no!
Aaah...
♫ Aquel amor

Aladin.
Mr Fenix.
Let's go.
♫ In the beginning
♫ God created the heavens
♫ And the earth
♫ Water
♫ Fish
♫ And plants
♫ And trees
♫ Yielding fruit
♫ And birds
♫ Flying above the earth
♫ And God created... ♫
♫ Man! ♫
And woman.
♫ And...
♫ Woman
♫ Then the serpent
♫ Came with temptation... ♫
Aah!
♫ And with all sorts of fruit ♫
Now, eat it.
♫ And then
♫ They knew sin
♫ Universal... universal sin! ♫
♫ Ah! ♫
- You were fantastic.
- That's enough.
I'm so tired.
I want to get out of here.
Fenix.
With your hands...
and my body...
we'll have an act that will be...
sensational.
Come on.
Ladies and gentlemen, Rubi the Virgin!
♫ Bésame
♫ Bésame mucho
♫ Como si fuera esta noche
♫ La última vez
♫ Bésame
♫ Bésame mucho
♫ Que tengo miedo a perderte... ♫
Ay-yi-yi!
- I've been thinking about your idea.
- You have?
- Can we see each other later?
- Sure.
- Here?
- Mm.
I love your nose.
Oh, you scared me.
I was thinking...
how we could join...
your art...
and mine.
A man like you always finds a way.
I will do anything you want.
First...
I will tie you to a wheel...
and I will throw knives at you.
One here.
One here.
And one here, next to your mouth
so you can kiss it with your lips.
And then...
the last one... here.
I will be afraid.
Don't worry, you'll love it...
because I will hypnotise you.
Aah.
Fenix!
You know what you have to do.
No, I don't want to!
This girl has defiled you with her lust.
No, Mum, it's not true! It is only a game!
No! I can't!
Don't ask me to!
I'm not asking you, I'm ordering...
my hands... and my arms...
to kill her.
- Kill her!
- Aah!
Stupid!
Wake her up.
Put her in the car.
And get a suitcase ready.
We are going home.
Please.
Please.
Please...
don't die.
Don't die, please...
- Don't die...
- Wake up!
You can't atone for your sins
with nightmares.
Huh!
Bring me my robe.
Hurry!
I want my breakfast.
I couldn't stand
those awful hotels any more.
I'm too tired to be travelling
around and around.
And you!
You are too weak to resist temptation.
Huh!
Without me you are nothing.
No one sees you
and no one notices you.
Just like your stupid hero.
Watch it! You're getting me dirty.
Now we are going
to practice my concerto.
No grace, no style!
You've got to move
my fingers more elegantly.
All right.
- Start again.
- But I can't do it. I don't remember.
I know that! At least you remember
the song of our patron saint.
Come on then, I want to play it.
♫ El fin del mundo se acerca ya
♫ Toda esperanza se acabará
♫ Ya las señales se están cumpliendo
♫ Se están cumpliendo como escrito está
♫ Querido amigo, Lirio te llama... ♫
♫ Y tendrás parte en la resurrección ♫
Stop it!
It's always roosters or swans!
You never see anything else
in your ridiculous hallucinations.
Ah!
It's over, Mummy.
My angel.
- Now let's sing.
- Aladin.

So you failed again?
- Oh!
- Come here.
Come here!
Come!
I want to finish the stockings
for Santa Lirio.
One, two, pass.
One, two, pass. One, two, pass.
Oh, Mr Fenix, what a pleasure.
I... I have the things that you ordered.
Mercury,
sulphur,
boric trisulphate.
Oh... I'd really like to see
your experiments, Mr Fenix.
- Really?
- Yes!
Why don't you invite me some time?
We could have dinner...
How about tonight?
I'll bring some flowers.
Ten o'clock all right?
Yes, I guess so. I have to go now.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Coming soon at the Coliseum,
an evening of wrestling!
Featuring The Saint,
the world's strongest woman!
Good! The Saint...
Oh! Oh!
Mr Fenix!
Mr Fenix?
Mr Fenix, what's happening to you?
Nothing. It was just an hallucination.
Eh, bonita,
no tiene nada para mí? Venga! Eh!
Culito.
Eh?
Qué? Una foto? No, no.
No... No?
Ahh... Pobrecita. Espere. Una foto.
Eh? There.
Bueno.
How great is that?
The audience will buy it.
The next trick - attack and defence.
That's it for today.
They can hit the showers.
Mm, what are you doing here?
You're very nice.
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?
Yes.
I like you so much
that I would like to have you in my show.
Do you have
your own company or theatre?
A little theatre in my house.
Hm.
Would you like to take me there tonight?
For a quick rehearsal?
- If it's not asking too much.
- Hey, I like you.
You got a bottle on you, baby?
Ahh, nice.
Hm.
Shh!
Careful, Saint.
This is my theatre.
I like this strong
and beautiful body of yours...
that could fight me off.
- Oh!
- Why should I, sugar? Mm?
Fenix? Where are you?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing. It was only my imagination.
Ladies and... Ladies.
The show is about to begin!
Come, Lothar.
You are about to witness
the ultimate miracle,
the transformation of death into life.
I will change this mummy
into one hundred flying doves!
Watch out, Saint!
For now you have to fight me off.
What's happening to you?
Are you going crazy?
Kill her! Kill her!
Did you hear her?
She wants me to kill you with my hands.
Kill her!
Kill her!
- Kill her!
- Please...
break my arms.
Kill her!
Crazy fool.
Use the sword.
Yah!
Why did you...?
Forgive me.
Please, forgive me.
What have I done?
Alma.
I have been waiting for you...
for so long.
You've come...
to take me... away?
Fenix!
You will never take
my son away from me!
I order my hands to kill her!
No!
No!
- Yes!
- Oh...
Cut off her arms!
Cut off her arms!
Is anybody home?
Mr Fenix? Mr Fenix!
Somebody help me!
No!
Kill her!
- Oh!
- Yes! Kill her!
- Kill her!
- No!
Kill her!
Kill her! Kill her!
Kill her! Kill her!
Kill her! Kill her!
Cut off her arms!
Cut off her arms! Cut off her arms!
Cut off her arms!
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!
Kill her!
- Cut them off!
- Aaah!
Now get out of my life!
Disappear!
You will never be free of me!
I'm inside of you!
Oh!
Oh!
♫ Yo ya me voy... ♫
Mother.
♫ Al puerto donde se haya
♫ La barca de oro

My mummy is dead.

Hey!
Ándale, ándale.
Throw her out the window.
One!
And two!
And three! And four!
A fire!
Whoo!
♫ La, la, la-la-la-la! ♫
Goodbye!
Mr Fenix.
Aladin.
Put your hands up!
My hands...
My hands!
My hands.
