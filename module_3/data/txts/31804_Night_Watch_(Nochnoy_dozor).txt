Night.Watch.2004.480p.BDRip.XviD.AC3-ViSiON
As long as humanity has existed,
there have been Others among us.
They're human, yet they have abilities
beyond those of ordinary men.
Witches, sorcerers, shape-shifters...
...the Others are as varied
as stars in the sky.
The Others are soldiers
in the eternal war:
The struggle between Dark and Light.
Light Others protected mankind
from the Dark Others...
...who plagued and tortured humans.
Legend tells of a day
when the two armies met on a bridge.
Geser, lord of the Light...
...and Zavulon, general of the Darkness,
faced each other.
And neither one would give way.
And so began a great battle...
...bloody and merciless.
Zavulon gloried in the slaughter.
But Lord Geser wept.
As the screams of the dying
reached heaven...
...Geser realized the armies
were equally matched...
...and he knew that unless
the fighting stopped...
...every last soul would perish.
So he stopped the battle.
Thus, the forces of Light and Darkness
forged a truce.
Geser spoke for the Light...
...and Zavulon spoke for the Darkness.
And these things were agreed:
No one could be forced to good or evil
without choosing freely.
The soldiers of Light
would be called Night Watch...
...making sure Dark Others
obeyed the truce.
And the soldiers of Darkness would
be called Day Watch, to do the same.
And so the balance would be kept
for centuries to come.
But one day, an Other would come...
...more powerful than any before him.
Like all Others, he would have to choose
between Light and Dark.
And his choice would
change the balance forever.
Hi. l'm here about your ad.
Did you bring a picture?
Yeah.
Just a second.
-Here.
-Let me see it.
Come on in.
It's messy in here,
so go into the kitchen.
Have a seat, son.
Don't worry about a thing.
You don't mind if l call you son,
do you?
You're all like sons to me.
-Look, the reason l came--
-l already know the reason you're here...
...Anton.
You loved her
and you took care of her...
...and a few days ago,
she just packs her bags...
...then leaves you.
I take after my grandmother
and my mother.
The women in my family have a gift.
-l'll take care of everything.
-Yes, but what I don't get--
What is it you don't get?
She's going to have a baby.
It's not yours.
Don't worry.
I'll get her back for you, no problem...
...but the baby will pull her away
from you, toward the other man.
But to kill an innocent child...
-...is a great sin.
-Yeah?
Yeah.
So you're saying
to get my wife back...
...we need to kill an unborn child--
Why are you so afraid, Anton?
I clap my hands like this...
...and he dies,
she just has a miscarriage.
But you must
take the sin on yourself.
-You know, the thing is--
-Do you? Take it?
-The sin?
-The sin.
-Sure.
-We have a deal?
We have a deal.
Don't worry. l'll take care of it.
Okay, almost there.
We just mix it up a little.
-With lemonade?
-Again with the questions.
Here, drink this.
Everything is sterilized. Drink.
Are you kidding? This is--
What's more important to you?
The ingredients?
Or the effect?
-The effect.
-Then drink it.
Come on.
What is it?
I can't be with you.
See? Was that so awful?
That's that.
And now for the next stage.
We will take care of the brat.
Red water, stranger's living walls.
The unwanted rotten seed.
Cease the time of evil growth.
That is what you need.
That is what is needed.
-Oh, no.
-Let it break the stranger's hold.
Unwanted seed, it cannot grow.
Let it break the stranger's hold.
Unwanted seed, it cannot grow.
Let it break the stranger's hold.
Unwanted seed, it cannot grow.
The roots are stopping.
It shall not be broken.
Don't!
-Can you give me a little help here?
-Let go of me.
-Stop it!
-Hey, knock it off!
Leave me alone.
Hold her hands! Hold them!
Leave me alone!
-Hold her hands!
-Damn it, l'm trying!
Hold her tight!
Come on!
Don't let go of her hands!
Help me, Mashenka!
Don't let go of her hands!
Hurry, stupid doll!
Damn, she's strong.
What does she eat?
-Hold on!
-Come, Mashenka. Now!
Get away!
Get away from me, little creep!
-Don't come any closer.
-Don't let her clap!
That little bastard is coming after me.
Tiger Cub!
Help us! Help! Help, somebody!
You stinking cops.
Using live bait on me.
-Let's just do the report.
-l'm not guilty.
Yeah, whatever.
You can tell your story to the judge.
Daria Leonidovna...
...you stand accused
of violating the truce, Article 1 3.
The charges are conspiracy...
...and premeditated attempt
to assassinate by using witchcraft.
What's your occupation?
I'm a gardener.
-Oh, yeah? You got a license?
-Sure, l do.
How in the world did you
get a license for that?
-Who would give you one?
-Who are you people?
This guy sees us?
He sure can.
He's an Other.
Come to me.
I'm waiting for you.
Do you think he's one of us?
You're sure he's an Other?
Yeah, he's a seer.
A seer?
Just what we need.
Another asshole
having visions of the future.
Visions?
What do you mean, "the future"?
Don't get any ideas.
You're not playing the lotto
or anything.
You can't choose what you see.
Why is it so dark?
That's the Gloom.
Only Others can go there.
I don't understand.
-lt's all different.
-Don't worry.
The world hasn't changed.
Only you.
Anton Gorodetsky.
We'll show you the proper techniques
for using live bait...
...such as minnows
and night crawlers.
Planning is important
if you want to land that big fish.
We'll be back with The Fishing Lifestyle
in just a moment, but first the weather.
The forecast says we can expect
warm, sunny days....
-Yeah?
-We've tracked him down.
Oh, yeah?
There isn't much time,
it's almost dark.
It's going to be cold tonight,
so dress warm.
They're using the Call
to bring the victim in.
We've traced it to the orange line of
the metro, but that's as far as we got.
You'll have to track them
on foot from there.
We need you to be on exactly
the same frequency as the victim.
Hear what he hears,
and feel the Call, just like he does.
Feel it yet? Anything at all?
-No.
-You will soon.
When he hears the Call, his blood
pressure will rise and he could bleed.
He goes into a fugue,
a sort of walking trance.
He looks normal, but doesn't
think about where he's going.
He just knows he has to get there.
He thinks the signs he sees
along the way are instructions.
He obeys without question.
Go on, get away from here.
Anything he's told,
he takes as an order.
What do you want? Go away.
Where do l go?
Don't let him out of your sight.
Understand?
Please, I know.
Don't forget your weapon.
I got it.
Just make sure you use
the right light bulb this time.
When you hear the Call just as clear
as the victim is hearing it...
...you'll know you've found him.
If you're not feeling it yet...
...try another swig of that red stuff.
I just ran out of the shit.
Need me to get more?
No, I'll handle it.
Hey. Anton.
Why are you awake?
Just let me get dressed. Wait.
Hello there, neighbor.
-Hey, Pop.
-l told you not to bring anyone here.
He's cool.
This blood is still hot.
Is it swine?
Look, this kind of stuff is nearly
like what a human has.
And pigs are even being used for organ
transplants these days, it's so close.
Who'd that be?
Humans.
We like you a lot, Anton.
-Who's that?
-Our family.
Kostya and me.
Why did you bring him here?
Because he's one of us now, eh?
No, Kostya. He's a Light Other.
There's only one time they ever
drink blood on the Night Watch:
When they're out hunting
us vampires.
Hey, Bear!
-Bear!
-What?
He still hasn't called in! Try him again!
I don't think he's answering.
How do you know?
-Fine. l'll call again.
-All right.
Where the hell is he anyway?
-Probably the metro.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
Come to me now.
I'm waiting.
Come to me.
Come now.
You don't look good.
You feel like shit, don't you?
I feel like chewing off your ear,
asshole.
Don't shove!
-What is your problem?
-Quit shoving, you jerk!
Stop it.
Wearing sunglasses, even in the middle
of the night, screaming like a lunatic.
Get a job.
Sorry.
Come.
I'm waiting.
You. Let's have a look at your lD.
Anton Gorodetsky, huh?
Let's see your eyes.
Been doing some drinking?
Only blood.
-Just blood.
-Yeah. Yeah.
You're drunk, all right.
No doubt of that.
Drunk and disorderly, too, to boot.
Freeze. Hey, freeze!
Grab him! Grab him!
Oh, man. What the fuck
you been drinking?
Blood.
Get out of here.
Come to me.
Approximate location, Anton.
Which building you in?
Anton?
Hey, is something wrong?
Don't turn off the phone.
We'll use it to find you.
Let's move out.
I need to diet.
Let's go.
You're with them. Now drink him.
I can't.
Wait. Will you just come back here?
Just do it.
All right, boy. Where are you?
This is the Night Watch.
Step out of the Gloom now.
-Go through the center, it's faster.
-You wanna drive?
Simeon, the light is red!
Run, boy! Now!
So you're using live bait now,
is that it, pig?
No. Just me.
Andrei!
-My teeth! You broke my teeth!
-l got bad news.
Hello? Anton?
Did you get an address for us?
Twelve.
-What was that?
-Number 1 2.
-No, I think it was 1 0. Ask him again!
-lt was 1 2.
Andrei! Stop it!
Let him go! Andrei! No!
Simeon! What are you doing?
Look out! Look out! lt's Zavulon!
Andrei, you've got to stop!
Let him go!
Where are you?
I don't want to hurt you.
Come out of the Gloom.
I told you it was number 1 2,
but you wouldn't listen to me.
Here, make him come to me.
The Day Watch is here.
Your colleague is charged with
causing the unlawful death of an Other.
-What did he say?
-l don't know.
I can't hear anything
over this engine.
We've gotta go.
We have an emergency.
Oh, yeah, and you might want to move
that pretty car out of the area here.
We wouldn't want to
run over it accidentally.
See you around.
City Light Company. This is Geser.
It kind of went bad, sir.
-Bad?
-He killed one of them.
-But the female got away.
-Is he all right?
Well, it's like this:
You have any idea how many number
1 2's there are on that street?
Yes, yes, how is he?
What happened?
Bring him to me right now.
CITY LIGHT COMPANY
On my desk now!
Faster!
All right, everyone out...
...right now. Move.
Every Night Watch officer
must be proficient in combat.
From the cooks...
...to the laundry workers.
Chiropractors.
Programmers.
You should have gone into the Gloom,
entered the Dark place...
...and just arrested the vampire,
instead of smashing him to bits.
But lately, everybody's
breaking the rules.
Dark or Light, well,
it's like there is something in the air.
I saw--
Yes, yes. Go ahead. Tell me.
A woman.
Yeah. On the train.
From the Light? Was she young?
That's not her.
Say it.
I saw the vortex.
Damnation.
The vortex.
I saw it.
I saw it right over her head.
Please don't.
Listen carefully, Anton.
Don't.
You have to take me there.
Take me there.
Let's go.
It was on the train.
What is your problem, you lug savage?
There was a girl...
...with a vortex over her head.
I thought she was a vampire
so I used the flashlight.
But she was something even worse.
That's it.
Come back, Anton. Come back now.
Come on back.
Did you see her?
Oh, l saw her.
Remarkable.
Analytical department.
Call a meeting.
Anton found a vortex of damnation.
I need to know what the weather looks
like in the city for the next 24 hours.
I'm on it now.
Tornado warning for Moscow.
LEGENDS OF BYZANTlUM
The Virgin, that's who you saw.
Long ago, when the world was young
there was a virgin in Byzantium.
She was a good woman,
pure and kind...
...but someone put a curse on her.
Wherever she went,
misfortune was sure to follow.
Whenever she held a candle,
it would go out.
If she were to pet a puppy,
it would die.
lf a bird ate from her hand,
it would drop to the ground.
Children died in the houses
she visited.
The power of the curse opened
a vortex of damnation...
...and the first forces
of Darkness were born.
But the warriors of Light
rose up to fight them...
...so began the great battle
between Light and Dark.
All because a human
was cursed by a human.
The legend says the Virgin
will appear again and be cursed again.
She will herald another battle...
...the Final Battle
between good and evil...
...and the balance
will be broken forever.
The Great Other will appear.
If he takes the side of Light,
Light will triumph.
But wise men say he will
choose the Darkness.
Because it's easier for a man to
destroy the Light inside himself...
...than to defeat the Darkness
all around him.
The prophecy is coming true.
It's begun.
Zavulon?
Put Alice on.
Here, it's Zavulon.
Sounds serious.
It's a busy occasion now.
-Then you don't know what happened.
-No, what?
They killed Andrei.
Smashed his skull against a sink.
You know what l want you to do,
so don't delay. Get on it.
Right away.
We need to find Andrei's girlfriend.
That little idiot with the burned face.
How long since she turned?
Couple days. The Night Watch
gave Andrei a license to bite.
She was so in love with him
she didn't even run.
Stupid little twit.
Young, beautiful, reckless,
I think you know the type.
Anyway, Andrei took her
like a midnight snack.
Now he's dead and she's starving.
Then this won't be hard.
-Mine!
-You want it bad, don't you?
Mine!
Andrei taught you how to use the Call.
What if he did? Give it to me.
The boy came when you called.
Call him again.
Then when you've got him
in your hands one more time...
...tell him you want the guy
who killed your Andrei.
My Andrei. Come on, give it to me.
Give it to me! l need it now!
You want revenge, don't you?
-Give it to me.
-You don't have to torture her.
Give it to me!
-She'll sure as hell find that brat now.
-Yeah, and how's that gonna work?
Like a starving dog.
She'll sniff him out.
Where are you?
Come to me.
Where are you going?
I have to go out and find him.
Find who?
The boy.
What are you going to do?
You're barely alive.
Your glimpses of the future
won't help fieldwork.
Drinking blood, hunting vampires...
...you're not fit for it.
Not the point of this.
What is?
We are giving licenses to Dark Others.
-Your point?
-We use innocent humans as live bait...
...to see if they're breaking the truce.
Is that right? Who says so?
I do. l'm the one.
It's true, so l'm saying it.
You don't know
what goes on out there.
You sit in here...
...you don't understand.
A little boy, that's all he is.
Just a child.
But to the vampire girl,
he's a glass of water in the desert...
...taken away before she could drink.
If l don't find him before her...
...then she'll have that drink.
Hold on.
I'll give you a partner.
You killed a Dark Other, Anton.
Zavulon won't forgive you for that.
You need protection.
What's that?
It's Olga.
She'll back you up.
This a joke?
All right, then. Suit yourself.
The hunting owl is one of nature's most
ruthless and efficient killing machines.
You have to make a choice...
...between Light and Dark.
Which will it be?
Who's there?
I'm not a killer.
I didn't want anyone to die!
I didn't want to kill you!
Get the team going.
Find out where she lives and works...
...anyone she saw
in the last three days.
We've got to find who put
this damned curse on her.
Every minute matters.
If we can lift this curse...
...we might be able to stop the
Final Battle before it starts.
A lot less messy,
but we need to move.
We don't have a lot of time left.
Is that her?
Yes. Svetlana Nazarova, 29 years old.
Works at medical clinic 1 7.
The Night Watch has never
heard a thing about her.
She lives with her mother in Vatutinki.
That's over near the airport.
Some interesting incidents
which could indicate a curse:
Her mother is hospitalized.
Kidney failure, needs a transplant.
A friend's kid got sick
right after she visited them.
And here's another one:
Her neighbor,
who she refers to as "Auntie Valya"...
...78 years old,
a pretty tough old bird...
...but last night she had to call
an ambulance.
Seems like all it takes is for Svetlana
to look at you...
...and something terrible happens.
-Valya. Hello there.
-Good evening.
What a cute little puppy.
Yes. Maxim found her at his job.
But we can't keep her,
she has to go to the pound.
Mom, we can do it, really.
Let her live.
-Take care of yourself, okay?
-Thank you, Svetlana, dear.
So, Olga--
You're hungry?
The feathered wonder.
Well, say something.
Talk to me, huh?
Don't turn around!
Don't! Don't look!
-Are you...?
-Don't look at me!
You afraid?
Shower...
...there.
Why did they do this?
It was a punishment.
How do l work this?
For hot, you push it up and to the left,
right for cold.
Yep-- Yeah, right.
I never heard of
a punishment like that one.
You've never heard
of crimes like these either.
Do you have any clothes I can wear?
Wait. Hold on.
You got any...?
You have some women's clothes?
Are you kidding?
Never mind. Excuse me.
Here. These belonged to my mom.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.
Something wrong?
No.
Come on in.
You know, Anton...
...there aren't too many now...
...so when a Dark Other
is taken away...
...we all feel the impact.
That's how it is, neighbor.
There is a truce in place.
-And we all know how it should work.
-How does it work?
Your guys and our guys
worked out some deal...
...that lets us do anything,
as long as we take turns?
There is one thing l really don't get.
Why do you get to give us licenses,
and not the other way around?
You know what it's like,
you've felt our hunger.
Anton?
-That's true.
-Anton?
Wait.
What's this for?
It's soap.
Look, what do you want me to say?
He was a cool guy.
-What?
-He was a cool guy!
"Cool guy," huh? He was a killer.
He killed people who had no way
to defend themselves.
He made a vampire
from an innocent girl.
She's like you now, only worse.
She doesn't know how to live with it.
You issued the license
for him to turn her.
They loved each other, Anton.
-Wanted to be immortal together.
-All l did was my job.
Boy, that was good.
I've been waiting 60 years for this.
Nice vampire you've got there.
He doesn't drink the living.
Maybe not now, but we know
that the time will come, won't it?
Yes! And then
I'll come to you legally...
...with the proper forms all filled out,
and you'll give me a fucking license...
...won't you, neighbor? Later.
Let him go.
-He's my neighbor.
-He's a vampire.
-He's an Other.
-He wanted to kill you.
-He brought you clothes.
-We're still enemies.
Get dressed.
Are these clothes still in style?
I don't know.
But they're all we've got.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I did once.
And when was that?
A long time ago.
And now where is she?
Don't know.
Been 1 2 years.
Did you take your medicine?
Did you take your Andipal?
Good boy.
Weather history is being rewritten.
Experts say that the winds
building outside Moscow...
...are the strongest ever recorded.
Meteorologists are completely baffled.
Hello? Hello, it's Irina, and l was
hoping you might be available tonight.
Yegor's blood pressure is high again.
Could you keep an eye on him?
There's an emergency at work
and l have to--
Mom.
You really can't?
-Are vampires real?
-Yes, Yegor.
They're little boys who have been known
to suck all the life out of their parents.
-Who else?
-l'm serious. They're real, I saw some.
Hello? Hello, Zhenya?
Zhenya? Is that you?
Oh, l'm sorry.
When do you expect her back?
Hey, honey, wanna go for a ride?
I said, wanna go for a ride?
Hello? Hello?
Zhenya.
Well, l'm really trying to find her.
Have you seen her tonight?
You haven't. Okay, thanks a lot.
Oh, great. So nobody's home tonight.
Here's your medicine. You're going
to take this right now, you hear?
Here are my keys.
I saw them. They're real.
-Yeah? Who is real?
-Vampires.
This game, it's enough now.
You're a big boy, you're old enough
to stay home alone.
Who are you?
I apologize. I assumed you knew.
I am Dracula.
Get out!
The vortex is 300 meters high...
...angular velocity 170...
...diameter is-- Wait a minute.
A plane entering the red zone.
What the hell? What airplane?
Charter from Antalya.
Bird in the turbine.
A bird, huh?
A crow.
Which floor is it?
-Seventh floor.
-What?!
-Seventh!
-Fuck.
Who left this thing open?
It's her.
She's here.
She could be anywhere.
It's safer if we go
through the Gloom.
I've seen you.
Can he really see us?
-He must be an Other.
-How much time do we have?
Not much. He can't survive very long.
He hasn't been trained.
How much time have we really got?
Ten seconds before
the Gloom takes him.
-l saw both of you!
-Look at me. Look directly at me.
Eight seconds.
-Seven.
-Don't close your eyes.
-Six.
-Give me your hand.
-Five.
-Give me your hand.
Four.
I'm not afraid of you.
Now.
Open your eyes.
Don't touch him now.
We're just too late.
Leave him alone.
If we stay,
the Gloom could take us too.
The Gloom is taking me over now.
We have to save the boy.
If we can distract the Gloom,
we might be able to slip him out.
Give it blood.
It was dark. Very dark.
Why was that?
Did you do that?
It's the Gloom.
Because you're an Other...
...you see it.
An Other?
Are you saying...
...l'm not ordinary?
No, not now.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
It's just...
...different.
Breaking news.
We have an emergency alert
from the National Weather Bureau:
Due to abnormally severe weather
conditions, a tornado watch is in effect.
What are "the Others"?
Well, let's see.
Scoot over.
Some people are just born special.
But most of the time,
they don't even know what's going on.
How do they find out?
Well, usually it's when they're forced
to do something out of the ordinary...
...like lift a car to rescue someone
who's trapped inside...
...or defend against
a vampire attack...
...something awakens in them.
Afterward, life is never the same.
If there's no one who cares enough
to explain what's happening to you...
...the things you need
to watch out for...
...and train you on how to use
your new gifts, you could die.
Every Other has a different gift.
Soon you'll discover yours.
You'll have to choose between
Light and Dark.
What type of Others are you?
Light or Dark?
We're Light.
And me?
That'll be up to you.
Understand?
What's the difference between
Light Others and Dark Others?
We live on what's inside people.
Dark ones on darkness,
Light ones on light.
Understand? Like food.
Then you don't eat regular food?
What a question.
We do, when it's offered.
Sorry.
Do you like dumplings?
-Dumplings? I love dumplings.
-Dumplings!
Yes, but what l don't get--
What is it you don't get?
She's going to have a baby.
It's not yours.
Don't worry,
I'll get her back for you, no problem.
The thing is, l'm not sure
about that information.
I'm willing to give it to you.
So, what are you muttering about?
What do you mean, you're not sure?
Well, all l'm saying is that
there's no way of knowing if this is true.
You must trust me on this, Anton.
-A boy, for sure.
-And how do you know?
Yegor?
Who's this?
My mom.
And how old are you?
I'm 1 2.
Are you sure she's not coming back?
Who?
The vampire girl.
No.
Not as long as we're here.
Did you salt the dumplings?
Hello, Zavulon. The vortex is almost
open and he's still with the kid.
What do we do?
Just be patient.
Everything will be
coming together soon.
In fact, the time is now.
753 heading to control. Request
clearance for emergency landing.
Negative, 753,
ground systems are down.
Maintain your altitude and stand by.
I said, give me all her contacts
for the last three days.
-Where are they?
-l can't do it.
-The software is totally outdated--
-Enough!
Let's go! Right now!
Call Anton.
We need him with Svetlana.
Hello? Anton, you there?
-Yes.
-We're moving headquarters.
-Going to Vatutinki.
-What's going on?
Svetlana's place is ground zero
for the vortex. We need you.
Tiger Cub and Bear
will take over with the boy.
-What the hell for?
-Hurry.
Here you go. Careful next time.
-You're going?
-Tiger Cub and Bear are coming.
You're leaving me with a bear?
Yegor. I'll be back soon.
-You sure?
-l'm sure.
All right. l trust you.
Be good.
Don't worry. They're going
to take good care of him.
He'll be fine.
She's right. lt'll all work out, Anton.
Watch the road, okay?
Keep your eye on the road, Simeon.
Simeon?
What's the matter?
Please help. lt's awful.
What happened?
-We must call him. Please, would you?
-Valya.
Valya. Valya is dead.
Maxim found the dog at work.
Please, Mom, let her stay.
-So, what's wrong?
-She's dead. Maxim's mother died.
-Who is--?
-Who the hell is Maxim?
The pressure's up, holding steady.
Where's the problem this time?
We have to call Valya's son.
You go, please. We can't.
It's all right. l'll call him.
I just can't believe it.
Shit! I left my sausages on the stove.
They're boiling over.
They're going to explode.
Hello.
Generating station?
Could l talk to Maxim lvanovich, please?
It's for you. Cover for me, will you?
Yeah, your sausages are exploding.
Hello?
-Maxim lvanovich?
-Speaking.
I'm sorry to tell you,
your mother has died.
Hello? Hello? Maxim?
Can you hear me? Hello?
The pressure is rising! lsn't anyone
watching the equipment in there?
Maxim Ivanovich, what's going on?
All of you, where the hell are you?
Shit. They're ready to blow.
Hang on, Maxim lvanovich.
Damn it, we're too late!
-Simeon, it's going to fall on us!
-Just relax.
Oh, my God, this is bad.
Where is it?
Where?
The vortex? Right there.
Come on, move your ass!
Kill the juice!
Get that cable up here!
-Here it is.
-Run it! Run it!
-That's enough!
-We need more!
-lt's getting there!
-Come on! Come on!
Here it is, don't drop it!
I checked Svetlana's apartment.
It is ground zero.
--pubs for instance. Shut down all pubs,
rock concerts, football matches....
Negative field density is 87 percent.
The vortex is expanding.
Finally! l got it!
-Who are these people?
-Oh, they live here.
Are you totally insane?
Shouldn't have been watching TV
while eating. Bad for the eyes.
Found out who cursed her yet?
No one cursed her. No one.
You act like you've never heard
of the Apocalypse before.
Or the end of the world.
You'll be okay. Keep working.
I remember back in 1 941 ,
the day l stepped on a landmine.
Now, that was earthshaking.
After that little bang, l hear okay out of
the right ear, nothing wrong with that.
-Excuse me.
-The other one....
Anton, l've analyzed the growth rate
and we have to get out of here.
This thing's going to blow up soon.
What's this pointy little arrow do?
What are you doing?!
Get away from that!
Did I ask you for your help?
Looks like you could use it,
fucking hacker.
Field density, 92 percent and rising.
You tried every contact? Everyone?
Fine, see what you can do.
-All right.
-l've checked all her friends...
...checked her acquaintances,
checked her family, everyone.
And absolutely nothing.
There's not a single Other
among them.
There is no one who
could have cursed her.
No one who could create
a curse this big.
Then what motherfucker did it?
Mother, let's try that.
I did it already.
Nazarova, Sergeyevna, born 1 947,
after the war.
Former schoolteacher,
retired after a full career.
Currently in the hospital,
diagnosed with a failure of both kidneys.
Anton, Geser is waiting for you.
I've checked her and checked her
a thousand times, and nothing!
She's not an Other.
Oh, shit.
So sorry.
"Anton Gorodetsky, revealed
as an Other on August 1 9th, 1 992.
Turned to Night Watch,
serving a probationary period.
Friendly with his neighbor,
who is a Dark Other.
History of heavy drinking
and alcohol abuse.
Considered capable of killing.
First discovered by Night Watch
during the arrest of Mrs. Schultz...
...for illegal practice of dark magic
under false pretenses."
False pretenses?
Why did you lie to him,
Daria Leonidovna?
You knew it was his child.
-Come on, Anton. Let's go.
-Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Anton, come on.
Hey, listen, what's the matter?
-Come on.
-What?
-We're seeing Geser, remember?
-Oh, yeah.
--where it's dangerous.
-We're doing everything we can.
-The Light Other with the dark past.
I've been looking for you.
Who's making that noise? ln the dark?
Knock it off, Zavulon.
I think the lights can be dispensed with.
I am your guest, after all.
-Give him the amulet.
-l'm not going against the truce.
I wouldn't do a thing like that.
He needs to be protected against you,
so give it to him, will you?
-Throw it.
-Throw it?
Behave, Zavulon.
Here, catch.
Repeat after me now:
You have no power over me, Zavulon.
You have no power over me, Zavulon!
Oh, well, l'll leave you two
to do the best you can.
We're already doing the best we can.
Let's go, Mutt.
See you around soon.
Go to her apartment
and find out who put the curse on her.
Why me?
There are two ways
to stop the vortex:
Find out who cursed her
and make them take it off again...
...or she'll have to die
so others can live.
It's that simple.
Are you saying
you want me to kill her?
One life against thousands.
Maybe millions.
The door code is 1 322.
What if she recognizes me
from the metro?
Tell her you're one of her patients,
feeling sick.
She sees hundreds like you in the clinic,
she'll think you're another one of them.
Anton, would you like me
to sing you something?
Sorry.
Hello there, Dr. Nazarova.
Can l help you?
I'm sorry to bother you
at home like this.
You have enough to do at work.
-lt's all right, come in. l'll take a look.
-Thank you.
Just let me wash my hands.
-Pretty as you remember?
-How's Yegor?
Don't worry, Tiger Cub and Bear
are taking care of him.
Good.
Come to me.
I think it's time for you to go.
Are you kicking us out?
Well, no. But my mom's
going to be coming home soon.
What do I tell her?
We're electricians.
Fixing the lights.
Watch this.
How is it you got a name like "Bear"?
Because he's a shape-shifter.
He can become a bear,
and l turn into a tiger.
Well, then show me.
Show you what?
How you turn into a bear.
Maybe some other time, Yegor.
I think you're embarrassed.
Why would you say that?
If you change like that, your clothes
will get all ripped up and torn...
...and then they'd all fall off.
And then you'd be naked.
That doesn't embarrass me.
Why should it?
Then go ahead and change.
There won't be anyone looking at you.
Come to me.
Now.
What is this, the circus?
Hurry.
Come to me.
Yegor!
Hurry.
Yegor! Wait!
Yegor!
Yegor! Come back!
Come to me now.
Yegor!
Yegor, wait!
I don't have the name yet.
Lie down, l'll be right in.
Lie down where?
Right in here.
All right, do you have pain?
Yes, l do. lt's in my stomach.
I think I may have an ulcer.
All right.
Is there pain?
How often?
Well, every day, I think.
Have you been under
a lot of stress lately?
Well, you know, the usual.
Does this hurt?
Yes.
It shouldn't.
This is not an ulcer.
Then, what?
Nothing.
You're completely healthy.
You're totally sure?
Then why would I be here?
Exactly. Why are you here?
-Back!
-Okay, okay.
I'll only talk to the one
who killed my Andrei.
-You mean Anton?
-Bring my Andrei's killer! Now!
Get out! Right now!
-You have been cursed.
-What?
Someone cursed you.
You're insane.
Yeah?
The vortex is expanding,
you've got to do something, now!
-Listen to me--
-You get out.
-No, listen. l'm trying to find out....
-Find out what?
No, no. Really, l've come to apologize.
Fine. No, l forgive you, totally.
You can go now.
-Then l'll go.
-You haven't asked me why.
-Why what?
-l....
Down in the metro, l pushed you.
That's okay. lt's not a big deal.
On purpose.
You were standing right in front,
and l pushed you.
I don't blame you. lt's all right.
-You bring me Anton! Now!
-Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay. l'm calling him.
Please, just go away.
Why are you doing this?
Have a drink with me.
It really won't take long.
-Hello?
-Hello.
Bring me Anton!
She won't wait anymore.
What should we do?
Just one, that's all l want.
-You're crazy.
-Just one little drink.
-What?
-What do we do?
Olga, l've got Bear checking in.
-What? What is it?
-They say they lost him.
-Who?
-Yegor!
-What?
-They lost Yegor!
-And the vampire wants Anton!
-Try to buy some time!
-What's that?
-That wasn't for you, Anton.
Tell me what the hell just happened!
Somebody better tell me
what's going on, and I mean now.
Anton, the vampire has Yegor,
but she wants you.
My mama's dying.
And it's my fault.
What l wanted was her to be gone.
I believed that if it weren't for her...
...l'd have been married
and had a child by now.
And as soon as l had that thought,
not even speaking it aloud...
...they called from the hospital.
They said her kidneys had failed.
And that she needed to have
a transplant performed.
The best chance she had.
And so I said
I'd donate one of my own.
I got through the tests...
...then she said no.
I knew she would.
I did it deliberately.
Believe me, l knew what l was doing.
If l'd just kept my mouth shut, the
transplant would have been performed...
...so l told her I was the donor,
knowing she wouldn't take my kidney.
It's all my fault, damn me to hell!
That's it!
Anton, you got it.
She cursed herself. She's an Other.
That was her power.
She took it back. The curse is lifted.
The vortex is diminishing.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the weather has cleared...
...and we have now landed safely.
Welcome to Moscow.
You should be careful
of what you say.
"Damned" is more than just a word.
That's it. Let's go.
Wait!
Hold on. I'll do it.
Okay.
I'm here now.
Here l am, let him go.
Take off the charm.
Shit.
All yours.
And the flashlight.
-l can't hurt you--
-Do it!
Okay, okay, fine!
Just don't do anything stupid.
You want some blood?
My life is what l want.
Well, then live.
Live!
Who's stopping you?
I just want to be human again.
You really want to be human?
Then behave like a human should.
Do you behave like
human beings should?
I loved Andrei...
...and you gave me to him...
...like a plate of food.
And then you took his life,
like an animal.
He really didn't give me any choice.
He had already broken the truce.
You, the Light ones, the good ones...
...the ones who say you protect
the world from the Dark.
Where were you
when he drank my blood?
Why shouldn't l be able
to drink this boy's now?
The reason is l won't let you do it.
Yegor, run!
Get lost. Get lost.
Get away from me!
Get away from me!
Don't touch me!
Yegor?
Lost it?
Where is he? Where's my son?
-Yegor!
-You have no right to interfere.
Anton!
Hush, hush, easy. Easy, now.
It's all right.
I brought the charm to you.
Did you want to kill me?
Well?
-No--
-Yes, you did.
No.
Don't believe that, I didn't.
Alice, read it.
"Night Watch Arrest Report,
dated report, August 1 9th, 1 992.
Mr. Gorodetsky visited
Mrs. Daria Leonidovna Schultz...
...residing at number 1 0,
Starozachatsky Alley.
While there, Mr. Gorodetsky
paid a fee to Mrs. Schultz...
...for a service involving dark magic.
Having been warned by Mrs. Schultz,
Mr. Gorodetsky still agreed...
...to take on the responsibility...
...for committing murder on the unborn
child of his wife, lrina Petrova."
So you really did want to kill me.
Yes. No.
-l was looking for you to--
-Kill me?
You wanted that?
Yegor! I beg you!
Don't go with them! They're Dark!
You are every bit as bad
as anyone over here.
In fact, you're worse.
You only pretend to be good.
I have waited centuries for this.
Everyone who's destined to drown...
...will all drown.
Everyone destined
to fall from a roof...
...will fall.
It was always the destiny
of this boy to be great.
But it was you who made him
choose the Dark.
And now it's done,
and you can't change it.
Stay away from him, understand?
I'll take care of him now.
You. You planned all this.
You bastard.
Go ahead.
Do it.
Again, come on.
Again. That's it.
Good. Yes.
Do it. Do it.
Good. Go. Again.
And so it came to pass
the Great Other came into the world...
...and chose the side of evil.
Legend says he will plunge the world
into darkness.
But so long as there are those among us
who believe in Light...
...there will be hope.
