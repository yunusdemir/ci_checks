I warned you.
Did I not warn you what would come
of dealing with Dwarves?
Now they've done it.
They've woken the dragon!
They've brought an apocalypse
upon our heads!
BRAGA:
Come on. Quickly.
Quickly.
MASTER:
Faster now...
...I'm trying to evacuate.
Careful, man.
Never mind the books.
Get on!

we not try to save the town?

The town is lost.
- Save the gold!

He's been down there for days.
He doesn't sleep.

Take only what you need.
We have a long march ahead.
[IN ENGLISH]
Where will you go?
There is only one place.
ALFRID:
The Mountain.
You are a genius, sire.
We can take refuge
inside the Mountain.
It might smell a bit of dragon,
but the women can clean that up.
It'll be safe and
warm and dry...
...and full of stores...
...bedding, clothing...
...the odd bit of gold.
What gold is in that
Mountain is cursed.
We will take only
what was promised to us.
Only what we need to rebuild...
...our lives.
Here.
Pull your weight.
News of the death of Smaug
will have spread through the lands.
Aye.
Others will now look
to the Mountain...
...for its wealth...
...for its position.
What is it you know?
Nothing for certain.
It's what I fear may come.
AZOG [IN BLACK SPEECH]:
BOLG [IN BLACK SPEECH]:

You saw something out there.
The Orc I pursued out of Lake-town,
I know who he is.
Bolg, spawn of Azog the Defiler.
A Warg pack was waiting for him
on the outskirts of Esgaroth.
They fled into the North.
These Orcs were different
from the others.
They bore a mark
I have not seen for a long time.
The mark of Gundabad.
Gundabad?
An Orc stronghold...
...in the far North of
the Misty Mountains.

Her strength is failing.
Take her to Lothl√≥rien.
My Lord Saruman.
He must be hunted down...
...and destroyed once and for all.
Without the Ring of Power...
...Sauron can never again
hold dominion over Middle-earth.
Go now.
Leave Sauron to me.
GANDALF: I need a horse.
RADAGAST: What?
Gandalf...
- ...where are you going?
- To warn Erebor.
They have no idea

THORIN:
And yet, it is still not found!
Do you doubt the
loyalty of anyone here?
The Arkenstone...
...is the birthright of our people.
It is The King's Jewel.
Am I not the king?
Know this:
If anyone should find it...
...and withhold it from me...
...I will be avenged.
[SIGHING]
Dragon-sickness.
I've seen it before.
That look.
The terrible need.
It is a fierce and
jealous love, Bilbo.
It sent his grandfather mad.
Balin, if Thorin...
...had the Arkenstone...
...or if...
...it was found...
...would it help?
That stone crowns all.
It is the summit of this great wealth...
...bestowing power...
...upon he who bears it.
Would it stay his madness?
No, laddie.
I fear it would
make him worse.
Perhaps it is best...
...it remains lost.
THORIN:
What is that?
In your hand.
It's nothing.
Show me.
It...
I picked it up in Beorn's garden.
You've carried it all this way?
I'm gonna plant it in my garden.
In Bag End.
It's a poor prize to
take back to the Shire.
One day, it'll grow.
And every time I look at it,
I'll remember.
Remember everything that happened,
the good, the bad...
...and how lucky I am
that I made it home.
Thorin, I...
DWALIN:
Thorin.
Survivors from Lake-town...
...they're streaming into Dale.
There's hundreds of them.
Call everyone to the gate.
To the gate!

- Keep moving.
ALFRID: Sire!
Sire!

Look, sire!
The braziers are lit.
So...
...the Company of Thorin Oakenshield
survived.
Survived?
There's a bunch of Dwarves
with all that gold?
I shouldn't worry, Alfrid.
There's gold enough
in that Mountain for all.
Make camp here tonight!
Find what shelter you can.
Get some fires going.
PERCY: Come on, hurry along now.
BARD: Alfrid.
You'll take...
...the night watch.
BOFUR:
Up it goes!
DWALIN:
That's it.
I want this fortress
made safe by sunup.
This Mountain was hard-won.
I will not see
it taken again.
The people of Lake-town have nothing.
They came to us in need.
They have lost everything.
Do not tell me
what they have lost.
I know well enough their hardship.
Those who have lived
through dragon fire...
...should rejoice.
They have much...
...to be grateful for.
More stone.
Bring more stone to the gate!
DWALIN:
That's it.
[BABY CRYING]
MAN 1: These children are starving.
MAN 2: We need food.

PERCY:
It'll be all right.
Don't worry.

We need more water.
The children, the wounded
and the women come first.
MAN 3:
Here you are.
BARD:
Good morning, Alfrid.
What news from
the night watch?
All quiet, sire.
Not much to report.
Nothing gets past me.
Except an army of Elves,
it would seem.
My Lord Thranduil, we did not look...
...to see you here.
- I heard you needed aid.
[CHATTERING]
Here you go.
MAN 1:
Pass it back.
MAN 2:
Another one.
BARD:
You have saved us.
I do not know
how to thank you.
Your gratitude is misplaced.
I did not come
on your behalf.
I came to reclaim
something of mine.
<i>There are gems in the Mountain
that I, too, desire.</i>
<i>White gems of pure starlight.</i>
The White Gems of Lasgalen.
I know an Elf Lord who will pay
a pretty price for these.
BARD:
Wait! Please wait!
You would go to war
over a handful of gems?
The heirlooms of my people
are not lightly forsaken.
We are allies in this.
My People...
...also have a claim
upon the riches in that Mountain.
Let me...
...speak with Thorin.
You would try to
reason with the Dwarf?
To avoid war?
Yes.
GLOIN:
Not a bad night's work.
Come on.
Hail, Thorin, son of Thrain.
We are glad to find
you alive beyond hope.
Why do you come to the gates...
...of the King under the Mountain
armed for war?
Why does the King under the Mountain
fence himself in...
...like a robber in his hold?
THORIN: Perhaps it is because
I am expecting to be robbed.
BARD:
My lord...
...we have not come to rob you...
...but to seek fair settlement.
Will you not speak with me?
[CAWING]
I am listening.
On behalf of the
people of Lake-town...
...I ask that you
honor your pledge.
A share of the treasure...
...so that they might
rebuild their lives.
I will not treat with any man...
...while an armed host
lies before my door.
That armed host will attack this Mountain
if we do not come to terms.
And your threats do not sway me.
What of your conscience?
Does it not tell
you our cause is just?
My people offered you help.
And in return, you brought upon them
only ruin and death.
When did Lake-town come to our aid
but for the promise of rich reward?
A bargain was struck!
A bargain?
What choice did we have
but to barter our birthright...
...for blankets and food?
To ransom...
...our future in exchange
for our freedom?
You call that a fair trade?
Tell me...
...Bard the Dragon-Slayer...
...why should I honor such terms?
Because you gave us your word.
Does that mean nothing?
Be gone!
Ere our arrows...
...fly!
[GRUNTS]
BILBO:
What are you doing?
You cannot go to war.
- This does not concern you.
- Excuse me...
...but in case you haven't noticed,
there is an army of Elves out there.
Not to mention several hundred
angry fishermen.
We are, in fact, outnumbered.
Not for much longer.
What does that mean?
It means, Master Baggins...
...you should never
underestimate Dwarves.
We have reclaimed Erebor.
Now...
...we defend it.
He will give us nothing.
Such a pity.
Still...
...you tried.
- I do not understand.
Why?
Why would he risk war?
[GRUNTING]
It is fruitless to reason with them.
They understand...
...only one thing.
We attack at dawn.
Are you with us?
Aye.
THORIN:
Master Baggins, come here.
You're going to need this.
Put it on.
This vest is made of silver steel.
Mithril...
...it was called by my forebears.
No blade can pierce it.
I look absurd.
I'm not a warrior,
I'm a Hobbit.
It is a gift.
A token of our friendship.
True friends are
hard to come by.
I have been blind...
...but now I begin to see.
I am betrayed.
Betrayed?
The Arkenstone.
One of them has taken it.
One of them is false.
Thorin...
...the Quest is fulfilled,
you've won the Mountain.
Is that not enough?
- Betrayed by my own kin.
- Now, uh...
...you made a promise
to the people of Lake-town.
Now, is this treasure...
...truly worth more
than your honor?
Our honor, Thorin. I was also there.
I gave my word.
For that, I am grateful.
It was nobly done, but the treasure...
...does not belong to the people...
...of Lake-town.
This gold...
...is ours.
And ours alone.
By my life...
...I will not part...
...with a single coin.
Not...
...one..
...piece of it.
TAURIEL:
Gundabad.
What lies beyond?
An old enemy.
The ancient kingdom...
...of Angmar.
This fortress was
once its stronghold.
It is where they kept
their great armories.
Forged their weapons of war.
TAURIEL:
A light. I saw movement.
LEGOLAS:
We wait for the cover of night.
It is a fell place, Tauriel.
In another age,
our people waged war...
...on those lands.
My mother died there.
My father does not speak of it.
There is no grave.
No memory.
Nothing.
- Unh!
GANDALF: Let me through!
Make Way!
[MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
[MEN GRUNT]
ALFRID:
No, no.
No! Oi! You!
Pointy hat!
Yes.
You.
We don't want no tramps, beggars...
...nor vagabonds here.
We got enough trouble
without the likes of you.
Off you go.
On your horse.
Who's in charge here?
Who is asking?
GANDALF: You must set aside
your petty grievances with the Dwarves.
War is coming!
The cesspits...
...of Dol Guldur have been...
...emptied.
You're all...
...in mortal danger.
What are you talking about?
You know nothing...
...of Wizards.
They are like winter thunder
on a wild wind...
...rolling in from a distance,
breaking hard in alarm.
But sometimes a storm...
...is just a storm.
Not this time.
Armies of Orcs are on the move.
These are fighters.
They have been bred for war.
Our enemy has
summoned his full strength.
Why show his hand now?
Because we forced him.
We forced him when the Company of Thorin
set out to reclaim...
...their homeland.
The Dwarves were never meant
to reach Erebor.
Azog the Defiler was sent to kill them.
His master seeks
control of the Mountain.
Not just for the treasure within...
...but for where it lies,
its strategic position.
This is the gateway...
...to reclaiming
the lands of Angmar in the North.
If that fell kingdom
should rise again...
...Rivendell, L√≥rien, the Shire...
...even Gondor itself, will fall.
These Orc armies you speak of,
Mithrandir...
...where are they?

counted for so little?
What do you think
I'm trying to do?
Save your Dwarvish friends,
and I admire...
...your loyalty to them.
But it does not dissuade me
from my course.
You started this, Mithrandir.
You will forgive
me if I finish it.
Are the archers in position?
FEREN: Yes, my lord.
- Give the order.
If anything moves
on that Mountain...
...kill it.
The Dwarves are out of time.
You, Bowman!
Do you agree?
Is gold so important to you?
Would you buy it
with the blood of Dwarves?
It won't come to that.
- This is a fight they cannot win.
BILBO: That won't stop them.
You think the Dwarves will surrender?
They won't.
They will fight to the death.

THRANDUIL:
If I'm not mistaken...
...this is the Halfling
who stole the keys...
...to my dungeons from under...
...the nose of my guards.
Yes.
Sorry...
...about that.
I came...
...to give you...
...this.
The Heart of the Mountain.
The King's Jewel.
And worth a king's ransom.
How is this...
...Yours to give?
I took it as my 14th share
of the treasure.
BARD:
Why would you do this?
You owe us no loyalty.
I'm not doing it for you.
I know that Dwarves
can be obstinate...
...and pigheaded...
...and difficult.
They're suspicious and secretive...
...with the worst manners...
...imaginable,
but they are also brave...
...and kind...
...and loyal to a fault.
I've grown...
...very fond of them,
and I would save them if I can.
Now, Thorin...
...values this stone above all else.
In exchange for its return,
he will give you...
...what you are owed.
There will be no need...
...for war.
<i>GANDALF:
Rest up tonight.</i>
- You must leave on the morrow.
- What?
- Get as far away from here as possible.
- I'm not leaving.
You picked me as the 14th man.
I'm not leaving the Company.
There is no Company.
Not anymore.
Imagine what Thorin will do
when he finds out what you've done.
I'm not afraid of Thorin.
Well, you should be.
Don't underestimate...
...the evil of gold.
Gold over which...
...a serpent has long brooded.
Dragon-sickness seeps
into the hearts of all...
...who come near this Mountain.
Almost all.
Heh.
You there.
Find this Hobbit a bed...

with hot food.
He's earned it.
<i>Hey-</i>
Keep an eye on him.
If he should try...
...to leave, you tell me.
ALFRID:
Move it!
Stupid Hobbit.
Wakey-wakey, Hobbit.
Up you get.
I will put the next
one between your eyes.
[ALL SHOUTING]
We have come to tell you...
...payment of your debt has been offered...
...and accepted.
THORIN:
What payment?
I gave you nothing.
You have nothing.
We have this.
KILI:
They have the Arkenstone.
Thieves!
How came you by the heirloom
of our house?
That stone belongs to the king!
And the king may have it...
...with our goodwill.
But first he must
honor his word.
They are taking us for fools.
This is a ruse.
A filthy lie.
The Arkenstone is in this Mountain!
It is a trick!
BILBO:
It's no trick.
The stone is real.
I gave it to them.
You?
I took it as my 14th share.
You would steal from me?
Steal from you?
No.
No, I may be a burglar,
but I like to think I'm an honest one.
I'll let it stand
against my claim.
Against your claim?
Your claim.
You have no claim over me,
you miserable rat!
I was going to give it to you.
- Many times I wanted to, but...
- But what...
...thief?
You are changed, Thorin.
The Dwarf I met...
...in Bag End would never have
gone back on his word.
Would never have doubted...
...the loyalty of his kin!
Do not speak to me...
...of loyalty.
Throw him from the rampart!
Did you not hear me?
I will do it myself.
Curse you!
No!
Cursed be the Wizard...
...that forced you on us!
- If you don't like my burglar...
...then please...
...don't damage him.
Return him to me.
You're not making a very splendid figure
as King under the Mountain...
...are you, Thorin...
...son of Thrain?
THORIN: Never again will I have dealings
with Wizards!
Go.
Or Shire rats!
BARD:
Are we resolved?
The return...
...of the Arkenstone
for what was promised?
Give us your answer.
Will you have peace...
...or war?
[CAWS]
I will have war.

Ironfoot.
[ALL SHOUTING]
[SHOUTS IN ELVISH]
Who is that?
He doesn't look very happy.
It is Dain, Lord of the Iron Hills.
Thorin's...
...cousin.
- Are they alike?
I've always found Thorin
the more reasonable of the two.
DAIN:
Good morning.
How are we all?
I have a wee proposition...
...if you wouldn't mind giving me
a few moments...
...of your time.
Would you consider...
...just sodding off?
All of you!
Right now!
Stand fast.
Come now, Lord Dain.
Gandalf the Grey.
Tell this rabble...
...to leave, or I'll water...
...the ground with their blood!
No need for war...
...between Dwarves, Men and Elves.
A legion of Orcs...
...march on the Mountain.
Stand down.
I will not stand down
before any Elf.
Not least this faithless Woodland sprite.
He wishes nothing
but ill upon my people.
If he chooses...
...to stand between me and my kin...
...I'll split his pretty head open!
See if he's still smirking then.

Since when do we forsake...

Thorin...

There are halls beneath halls
within this Mountain.
Places we can fortify...
...shore up, make safe.
Yes.
Yes...
...that is it.
We must move the gold
further underground...
...to safety.
- Did you hear me?
Dain is surrounded.
They're being slaughtered, Thorin.
Many die in war.
Life is cheap.
But a treasure...
...such as this cannot be counted...
...in lives lost.
It is worth...
...all the blood we can spend.
You sit here in
these vast halls...
...with a crown upon your head...
...and yet you are lesser now
than you have ever been.
Do not speak to me...
...as if I were some lowly Dwarf Lord...
...as if...
...I were still...
...Thorin...
...Oakenshield.
- I am your king!
- You were always my king.
You used to know that once.
You cannot see what

Go.
Get out.
Before I kill you.

Legolas.
Legolas Greenleaf.
There is a second army.
Bolg leads a force of Gundabad Orcs.
They are almost upon us.
Gundabad.
This was their plan all along.
Azog engages our forces,
then Bolg sweeps in from the North.
The North?
Where is the North...
...exactly?
- Ravenhill.
Ravenhill?
Thorin is up there.
And Fili and Kili.
They're all up there.
KILI:
Where is he?
It looks empty.
I think Azog has fled.
I don't think so.
Fili...
...take your brother.
Scout out the towers.
Keep low and out of sight.
If you see something...
...report back.
Do not engage.
- Do you understand?
- We have company.

No more than a hundred.
We'll take care of them.

[HORN BLOWING]
My lord, dispatch this force...
...to Ravenhill.
The Dwarves are about...
...to be overrun.
Thorin must be warned.
By all means, warn him.
I have spent enough Elvish blood
in defense...
...of this accursed land.
No more.
Thranduil?
<i>I'll go.</i>
Don't be ridiculous.
You'll never make it.
Why not?
Because they will see you coming
and kill you.
No, they won't.
They won't see me.
It's out of the question.
I won't allow it.
I'm not asking you to allow it, Gandalf.

What does it matter?
They are mortal.
You think your
life is worth more...

There is no love in you.

Nothing.
