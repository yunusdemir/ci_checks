MAKIN: Freeze!
Hands out of your pockets,
away from your body.
Suck wall!
Get your feet back and spread 'em!

CHIEF:
We have come to mourn and honour
not only the passing of a friend
but of a fine police officer,
an officer who was an
example to us all.
Samuel Edward Makin died as he
lived, defending the American way.
That is why I feel more
pride than sorrow,
for Samuel Makin made
the ultimate sacrifice.
He did so willingly and no
man can hope to do more.
His body may be
returned to the earth,
but his spirit will live forever.
We, your fellow officers,
salute you, Sam.
Your duty done, may
you rest in peace.
OFFICER: Ready!
- Aim! Fire!
- (SHOTS FIRED)
(HE GASPS)
I was shaving you.
- Where am I?
- Don't worry. Everything will be fine.
That's not me. What the
hell have you done to me?
We did some work on you.
Just your face.
- Thank you, nurse.
- You better have a good reason.
We did.
- You were ugly.
- Who's "we"?
You've been recruited by an
organisation that doesn't exist.
Sam Makin is dead. Some nasty man
shoved him into the East River.
I'm a pretty healthy corpse.
The operative word is "corpse".
You've got a new face, new
fingerprints, even a new name.
Williams. Remo Williams.
A lot of thought went into it.
We needed someone. You were
the best we could find.
Decorated cop, ex-Marine,
no family, no commitments.
If I'm the best you can
find, you're in deep shit.
Who the hell are you?
FBI, CIA, Salvation Army?
Who we are, are the people who've
got you by the balls, Remo.
Besides, we need you.
Our cops are corrupt, our judges
bought, our politicians up for sale.
Everywhere you look,
slime is on the loose.
You'll be the Eleventh Commandment:
"Thou shalt not get away with it."
You're the guy that set me up
at that warehouse, ain't you?
Nice job.
The name's MacCleary. We'll
get to know each other.
Enjoy the fruit... Remo.
Remo? Jesus!

Are you opening an account for me?
Let's go.
REMO: What do these things do?
Keep track of your wardrobe?
I thought they could
make those things small.
These are the small ones.
(DOORBELL BUZZES)
- Come in, Mr...
- MACCLEARY: Williams. Remo Williams.
Good evening, Mr Williams.
I'm Harold Smith. I'm the head of the
organisation that just recruited you.
Dumping me in the river and
reshuffling my face is recruitment?
Yeah. It works. Sit down.
Come on, my boy. I know
your ribs are hurting.
Sit down and make yourself comfortable.
I'll tell you about the way we work.
I've seen how you work.
You run black-bag
operations, kidnap people,
beat the shit outta them and
no one holds you accountable.
- Oh, we're accountable, Mr Williams.
- Let me guess. To the president.
Yep. And five of 'em before him. I've
lost track. I don't even vote any more.
Sorry to disappoint you.
I'm voting with my feet.
Now you wanna sit down?
(CLOCK STRIKES FOUR)
I'm only going to say this once.
This is a wonderful country but our legal
system doesn't work the way it should.
I'm talking about people who roam
the halls of power with impunity,
who corrupt and subvert the principles
our constitution exists to uphold.
He already gave me the
Gettysburg Address.
Has he? Here's another one.
"Guard, protect and
cherish your land,
"for there is no afterlife for a
place that started out as heaven."
Charles M. Russell, Montana, 1926.
1926? That's ancient history, Dad.
- Computer said you were a smart ass.
- Heard of computer error?
Not this one.
Take a look at that innocent
little box, my boy.
It's hooked to all those
computers you saw downstairs.
Every scrap of processed information
in the United States comes through here.
If it's out there, I can find it.
Helps us keep track of the bad guys.
I can find out the temperature of your ass
in that chair if I really want to know.
But it won't do everything.
That's why we've got you. You're gonna
help remove some of the filth in there.
I like that. That's nice.
It's a whole lot nicer than kill, destroy
or terminate with extreme prejudice.
- That's what you're really talking about.
- He's got it, Mr Smith.
That's exactly what
we're talking about.
Well, suppose I say no.
Then you're a dead son of a bitch.
And we already got a coffin.
How big is this organisation?
Just the three of us.
Mac here will get you
cleaned up and briefed.
You start work Monday
night, Mr Williams.
Here we are.
Nice pad, huh, Remo?
First hit?
No big deal. You'll get used to it.
Nothing like throwing in
a man at the deep end.
What's this guy done
that's so special?
Come on, Remo. We run on a
need-to-know basis. You know that.
Don't take any chances.
This guy's a killer.
Remember. In, out,
like a duck mating.
- Where are you gonna be?
- Right behind you.
(SCRAPING)
Hey, how do you open this?
Speakee English?
Does a nightingale sing?
Yeah, well... How do
you get outta here?
The same way you came in.
No good. There's a guy outside who
wants me to knock off your boss.
I am here alone.
There is no one upstairs.
Oh, look. Let's not make any
trouble for each other.
All I want to do is get outta here.
It is too late for that.
Hold it! I'll kill
you if I have to.
I'll show you chopsocky,
you sawed-off little runt.
Well, Chiun? What do you think?
He's very slow.
His reflexes are pitiful,
poorly co-ordinated.
He's in wretched
physical condition,
impetuous,
and clumsy.
He move like a baboon
with two club feet.
However, there is a feeble
glint of promise in his eyes.
I think I can do
something with him.
Good.

You'll have terror for breakfast, pressure
for lunch and aggravation for sleep.
Your vacations will be two minutes
when not looking over your shoulder,
and if you live to draw a
pension, it'll be a miracle.
Are there any disadvantages?
Hell, I'm lucky I've
lasted this long.
Tell me something. Can
you dodge bullets?
Nowadays only if
they come real slow.
- Do I really have to live with him?
- Chiun's not crazy about the idea either.
He says you smell like hamburgers.
Top floor. See you.
Hey, MacCleary.
If this is another set-up, you won't live
to collect that pension. I guarantee it.
Didn't I tell you? We don't
use that bang-bang stuff.
Your mind and your body
become your weapon.
That's what your new pal
Chiun is gonna teach you.
OK, so you caught me with
a couple of lucky shots.
But I gotta hand it to you, that
bullet-dodging number wasn't bad.
And I like the little thing
you did with the gun.
You move like a pregnant yak.
Sit.
Breathe.
Breathe? Come on, you've got...
Silence! A fool chatters,
whilst the wise man listens.
Breathe.
(EXHALES HEAVILY)
Wait. Is this the kind of training
where we sit around for ten years
until I break a brick with my toe?
You have come into
the care of Chiun,
Master of Sinanju.
Sinanju is a village in Korea where
all the fighting arts were born.
Kung fu, karate, ninjutsu.
They are all but shadows.
Sinanju is the sun.
Most intelligent people
know this already,
but it is apparent to me that
you know less than nothing.
Pay attention.
You did not ask to be white, so
perhaps that is not your fault.
You did not ask to be here, perhaps
that is not your fault either.
So let us make this pact.
I will train you for
your first service,
and then I will
return to my country.
Pressure, nerve ends. Sinanju.
Technique developed
since the birth of time
by the most gifted race on earth.
Do you always talk like a
Chinese fortune cookie?
Chinese? The Korean is the
most perfect creature
ever to sanctify the earth
with the imprint of his foot.
- Now we will breathe.
- Breathe.
Breathe out.
Slowly.
Do not gulp.
If you do not breathe correctly,
you do not move correctly.
Pitiful!
I can see the deadly hamburger
has done its evil work.
We must sweat the
poison from your body
and rebuild from the inside.
Now we will proceed
to lesson number two.
Follow, please.
What are you waiting for? Applause?
Midtown. 44th Street.
You are afraid.
Fear is nothing more
than a feeling.
You feel hot, you feel hungry,
you feel angry, you feel afraid.
Fear can never kill you.
Purge your mind of fear
and believe in yourself.
Without that belief, I
can do nothing with you.
Now we will do it again,
but faster.

I had marked for special surveillance.
I wonder who the intruder is.
(BEEPING)
- Oh!
- What's the matter?
- I can't get what I'm looking for.
- I hate to hear you say that.
Why should the HARP DBA
Cost 62 be restricted?
Maybe you've got cold hands.
Allow me.
See?
Do I sense frustration?
I'll bet you've had a lot
of experience at that.
If I continue to stroke
these little keys...
You might stunt your growth. No,
I'll seek satisfaction elsewhere.
WATSON: Come in!
- Major Fleming.
- General, I have a problem.
The computer's classifying cost
overruns within the HARP database.
- You know what I think about computers.
- It's not a malfunction.
- Maybe it hasn't been entered yet.
- It has, access has been denied.
General, I'm the senior
WCA on this post,
I should have access to that information,
there's no reason for it to be withheld.
Right. We do have a problem.
Let me have a full report.
You'll have it tonight. I'd appreciate action
by the time I return from Fort Baxter.
- Fort Baxter?
- The AR-60 test.
The Grove infantry assault rifle.
Of course, the AR-60.
You have a job to do.
But let me give you a word of advice.
Never feel you have to overdo it.
It makes no difference to
me that you're a woman.
That's good news, sir.
If it's any reassurance, it makes no
difference to me that you're a man.
(DOOR SLAMS)
What have you done with the food?
A Korean fingerboard.
- What are you staring at?
- You can't see.
- I can see.
- What are you wearing those for?
I wear glasses so
that I may see more.
A Korean fingerboard.
Begin tapping your fingers, slowly at
first, and then increasing the force.
With time, your nails will become
hard and your fingers strong.
They will be able to do more
than carry food to your face.
- They will become a trained weapon.
- Trained to kill?
Not kill. A truck kill.
Meat of cow kill.
American assassins
kill, like butchers.
Masters of Sinanju,
since the dawn of time,
have killed to promote harmony
and to bring about a more peaceful
humour to the entire community.
We have done this
throughout history.
For example, Genghis Khan.
The Persian boy, Alexander.
- Robin Hood.
- Robin Hood?
A bandit. Louis XIII. Napoleon.
Come on. Napoleon died in his bed.
Wrong.
All of them... perfect
assassinations.
You make it sound like
a public service.
Professional assassination is the
highest form of public service.
So I will persevere.
I have taken the
Emperor Smith's gold,
and a Korean's word is his bond.
Place your hands behind your head.
I did not say keep them there.
Your reflexes are pitiful.
The seasons move faster.
A result of all that filthy poison you
have been stuffing into your belly.
You know why Americans
call it fast food?
Because it speeds them
on the way to the grave.
(HIGH-PITCHED CHUCKLE)
As I feared, you have
no sense of humour.
From now on, you will eat rice.
Eat rice and play with
my fingerboard. Great.
Keep it near you.
Hang it on a wall.
How?
Find a nail.

- I've done that and come up empty.
Of course. Because you haven't played
hardball, like we did in Tennessee.
Let's give them a body,
see who claims it.
Start with him.
REMO: Couldn't we skip this
lesson and move on a bit?
Say, to lesson number 36?
Silence! The Emperor Smith is
disgusted with your progress.
He's not an emperor.
Enough. You are using only a fraction of
the power in your body and your brain.
Sinanju uses it all.
That is its sole secret,
its only strength.
You are here to conquer your
childish fear of heights.
When you have done so, we shall meet
below and start another exercise.
(REMO WILLIAMS THEME)
27, 28, 29, 30.
- You got it, mister.
- No problem. Like falling off a log.
I'll take mine now, Frankie.
Come on, give it to me.
- (CLUNK)
- (MAM GIGGLES)
What are you guys, crazy?
- You got no right, up here.
- Authorised personnel only.
- That's to prevent accidents.
- Suicide, that kind of thing.
OK, look. I'm coming
down, all right?
Yeah, you sure are. The short way.
End of the line, pal.
- He's coming your way!
- I got him.
Come on, get him now.
(CACKLING)
STONE: I rather enjoyed that.
WILSON: Eight and a half
gainer with a full twist.
Your people did a good job.
STONE:
All right, let's get out of here.
OK, guys, it's Miller time.
WORKER: I tried to grab him.
He must've slipped. Whee!
WORKER 2: I saw that.
- I'd buy that, Frank.
- He's falling down.
- Terrible.
- Tragic.
What the hell's going on?
Bastard.
He's behind you.
Go away!
(HORN BLASTS)
Get him.
All right, man.
I didn't do nothing.
- You can't come over here.
- Look out, buddy.
No! That's new cement, man.
Wait! Hey! Hey, buddy!
Mac, I could tell you what George Grove
had for lunch every day this month.
But I can't find out a
goddamn thing about HARP.
How did he manage
that little trick?
Good. I'm glad you're both here.
We're gonna sort something out.
I was just chased around the Statue
of Liberty by a bunch of goons.
What were you doing on
the Statue of Liberty?
Chasing pigeons! Those guys
are trying to kill me.
- Who?
- Our friend with the Tiffany tooth.
Will somebody tell
me what's going on?
- If he's on to Remo, he's on to us.
- Who's he?
Why don't we take him out
before he gets any closer?
No. I can't do that, Mac.
I need more to go on.
Those guys tried to kill me.
Mr Williams, CURE is not interested
in your personal problems.
CURE sucks, whatever CURE is.
Mr Williams, what we can't do
here is embarrass the president.
Now, a man named Grove has
discovered your existence.
But before CURE becomes visible,
we must all disappear
without a trace.
How do you plan to do that?
Simple.
Harold W. Smith, assistant research
manager, found dead in his office.
Massive coronary.
I keep this pill in my pocket.
Another man is found in the
stockroom of a men's haberdashery,
his head blown off.
Where does that leave me?
It leaves you with your
slant-eyed little buddy, Chiun.
He's got your number.
It should be fast and painless.
Hey, boys, we're not there yet.
But we'd better have a look at the
HARP and come up with something soon,
or we will have to
vacate this office.
MACCLEARY: So you and I are
going to visit Mr Grave's plant.
Allegheny, 10 o'clock, gate 23.
Don't be late.
(CLATTER)
There is something you wish to ask?
The answer is yes.
If the Emperor Smith so ordered
it, I would have to kill you.
It is in the contract.
Cliff wants you.
- Chiun teach you that?
- No.
Anti-personnel mine. Korea.
MACCLEARY:
See you back at the fence.
(GROWLS)
(DOGS SNARL)
What lesson number was dogs, Chiun?
Try to get up here,
you sons of bitches.
You're not your average
sons of bitches.
(DOGS BARK)
(DOGS SNARL)
(RATS SQUEALING)
(SCREAMS)
(ALARM BUZZING)
(SIRENS WAILING)
(SNARLS)
Try that, you mother.
(WHIMPERING)
MACCLEARY: Remo!
- What happened?
- Oh, man, I blew it.
MACCLEARY: Don't worry. I think I
got what we need here. Come on.
(EXPLOSION)
Grab that dozer.
(DOG BARKING)
Move it!
MACCLEARY: Jump!
(GRUNTS)
Get this to Smith.
He won't be with us
for much longer.
Has he talked yet?
Get Stone.
(ECG BEEPING STEADILY)
SMITH: HARP...
The so-called cornerstone of defence
for this nation for the next decade.
What about it?
What about it? There is
none. It doesn't exist.
REMO: But I saw the damn
thing, It blew up in my face.
I know.
What you saw was a fake, it was
window-dressing. It doesn't exist.
Before you got close enough to
figure it out, poof. Self-destruct.
Blew our only hard piece of
evidence right out of court.
Hell, I bet this guy's filing for his
fire insurance claims right now.
I gotta take my hat off
to this Mr Grove, Remo.
He'll get his appropriations
for HARP 2 and HARP 3,
and in six months' time nobody will
even ask him what happened to HARP 1.
You think it's funny?
Mac gives his life to get that
stuff so you can nail the bastard,
but he's gonna get away with
it and we can't stop him?
You can stop him, son.
Just tell me where he is.
Mount Promise.
But it's got to look like one
of Chiun's perfect accidents.
It'll be my pleasure.
Major, nice to see you again.
I feel I owe you an apology.
I get annoyed when someone
tells me how to run my business.
But you're just doing your job, and
pretty darned well, by the looks of it.
The important thing is that we're both
working for the same side, right?
Yes, Mr Grove. Speaking of
work, I have a lot to do.
Carry on, Major.
Actually, General, there was one point
I wanted to clear up with the Major.
- WATSON: What have you got there?
- Just a small matter of national security.
Who are you working for?
Let me explain something to you, Mr
Grove. A: I don't like being spied on.
B: you have no right to make
accusations that you cannot prove.
And C: I have no idea who these
men are or who they work for.
So if you'll excuse me, General,
I have things to attend to.
Hi. Er... Remember me?
Oh, yes. I remember you, all right.
You just set my
career back a decade.
I'm supposed to be your accomplice.
Who the hell are you?
- I could march you into that building now.
- But you won't.
Who are you to give me
orders? Army Intelligence?
You are Army Intelligence?
It's the AR-60, isn't it?
No wonder I've been having
trouble getting information.
We've been working on
the same thing. I'm sorry.
I don't know your name
or rank. Do I salute you?
You salute me.
Major Fleming, hi, I'm Jim
Wilson, Grove Industries.
General Watson asked
me to contact you.
He tells me you're concerned
about our AR-60s.
Damn right. It's time this
problem was taken seriously.
That's why I'm here. I've got one set up
on C range. I can run you down there.
I'd appreciate that,
Mr Wilson. Let's go.
What are you waiting for, soldier?
A presidential invitation?
The only thing our
guys could figure out
was that the retaining ring hadn't
been bolted down correctly.
It doesn't click on
like a bayonet joint.
If some dumb dogface doesn't follow specs
and tries to force it, it'll malfunction.
Malfunction? When a piece of
metal blows someone's head off,
that isn't malfunction,
it's defective manufacture.
It means that your company allowed
a design error to creep in.
Did you run the 310 test
and the 480 sequence?
- No. I think we're gonna find blowback.
- Blowback?
If that retaining ring is misaligned,
a bullet could jam in the barrel.
At 20 rounds a second at full automatic,
the results would be catastrophic.
Catastrophic is not the word.
I must tell you that the army has
long suspected Grove Industries of...
What the hell is going on?
Give it five minutes. Don't forget
to unlock the safety catches.
Got to look like a
nice little accident.
STONE: That's for my
friends at the statue.
This one's for me.
WATSON: So listen to this, George.
Four putts. Four putts, mind you!
I thought he'd have a stroke.
And I'd have claimed it.
Sir, there's been a serious incident at
the gas testing area. Fatal, I'm afraid.
- That's terrible.
- What happened?
One of your assistants, Mr Grove.
FLEMING: The first thing I'm
gonna do is file a 1611.
If that doesn't work, I'm
gonna nail him with a 1098.
Who were those bastards?
Wilson's gonna wish he'd never been
born by the time I've finished.
What the hell was he was doing?
Thank you.
By the way, I guess I should also thank
you for getting me out of there.
I remember passing out and then...
I think we'd better keep moving.
Hey, hey! That's not the way.
The camp is up there.
I know. That's why
we're going this way.
I've got to report this to General
Watson. Those people tried to kill us.
- Major Fleming...
- Rayner.
I hate to pull rank, but I want Grove
Industries as bad as you do, right?
Let's do it my way. Neat and tidy.
All wrapped up in one package.
- How does that sound?
- Sounds good to me. Sir.
Gentlemen, as of now this
base is on Alpha One alert.
This is not an exercise.
I repeat, this is not an exercise.
Military secrets have been stolen
and Major Fleming is missing.
Our infrared heat sensors
indicate two targets
moving west toward the
perimeter of the camp.
They must be intercepted
and detained.
Sir, if there's resistance,
do we return fire?
The security of the United States
is at risk. What do you think?
Gentlemen, you have your orders.
I haven't eaten this good in weeks.
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.
- Sure?
- Sure.
We're gonna be down at the lake.
(BIRD CHIRPING)
(REMO SCREAMS)
You are deaf.
I have been stomping around
here for ten minutes,
while you talk nonsense
with this... woman.
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.
Even worse, you and the woman
gorge yourself on sweets.
I do have a name.
Women should stay
home and make babies.
Preferably man child.
I see you both went to
the same charm school.
He always talks like
that. He's Korean.
I see. That's why he
lives in a forest.
No, he's here for a
special purpose. To kill me.
Not so. I am here to see that you do not
bring shame to the house of Sinanju.
If I do, then you kill me.
That I would do reluctantly because you
have been a good pupil, for a white man.
I see. So that makes
everything OK, does it?
You are very skinny.
(MUSIC ON CAR RADIO)
Why don't you try tightening
the pinion nuts first?
If I do that, I won't be able
to line up the splines, dummy.
Sure don't make 'em
like they used to.
I'll tell Lee lacocca
you said that.
Damn, what'd you do?
(KNOCKING)
REMO: The brakes!
Jesus! Jump.
- You all right?
- I'm fine.
You all right, Chiun?
- Oh!
- Oh, Christ.
Oh, God. Chiun.
In Korea, door handles
do not break.
Chiun!
Chiun, are you all right?
- Are you hurt?
- No.
When you approach middle age,
there is a tendency
towards bruising, my son.
What? What did you call me?
I call you a clumsy oaf.
You drive like a monkey in heat!
Oh, my God. Are you all right?
And why should I not be?
What are we gonna do now?
You're gonna stay with Chiun. He'll
probably teach you to breathe.
- I have a job to finish.
- Remo!
Do not embarrass us.
I won't.
Little father.
This is ridiculous. Do you
know what he's doing?
- They'll arrest him and court-martial him.
- Silence.
They'll lock him up for good and you just
stand there. Why don't you help him?
(GASPS)
Lesson 22. Blessed silence.
RADIO: 'This is Pine Tree Command.
'Gentlemen, I hope we're in
for some good hunting today.
'Prepare to copy your
sector priorities.
'That includes you and your little
buddies down there, Liebowitz.'

WOMAN:
'Roger, Pine Tree. Will comply.'
They better take the Bat Jet. You're
not gonna believe this, Pine Tree.
My system indicates human presence
50 metres above the ground.
This sucker must've grown wings!
This is Bandit Chief. I say
again, this is Bandit Chief.
Stop your goddamn chattering and give
me radio silence and map co-ordinates.
WOMAN: 'Coming right up, sir.'
MAN: 'You are proceeding
in a northerly direction.'
WILSON:
Not us, you jackass. The target!
WOMAN: 'Yes, sir.
Foxtrot, four, six, four.
'Zulu, five, zero, five,
heading toward the lake.'
GROVE: Stop!
All right, soldier. Nail
that commie son of a bitch.
Get him.
That guy's going nowhere, sir.
Oh, no!
- Shit.
- Are you out of your mind, George?
GROVE: It's your ass too, Scott.
- Damn. Get me more ammo!
- WILSON: He's getting away, George.
GROVE: I can see that.
What are you waiting for?
RADIO: 'Pine Tree Command.
Come in, Bandit Chief. Over.'
GROVE: Stop right there!
I used to be interested in who you
work for. Now I don't give a damn.
You're a dangerous
liability, my friend.
You'll be dead in about 15 seconds.
They'll probably give me a
medal for shooting you.
Who are you?
Remo Williams.
NEWS: 'Also found in the
wreckage of this tragic accident
'was George S. Grove,
chairman of Grove Industries,
'many times recipient of the
presidential medal for excellence
'and well known for his
contributions to charity.
'Also killed was Brigadier
General Scott...'
- Where's Chiun?
- He went to look for you.
OFFICER:
First squad, take a right flank.
Be careful, they may be armed.
Watch the Major. She's a
woman and she's on our side.
There he is.
SOLDIER:
Careful, men. Hold your fire.
You must run very fast.
Who are you?
Would you believe
we're the good guys?
Are you all right, Major?
Oh, yes. Fine.
Everything's fine.
CHIUN: Faster!
REMO: Sometimes you're
a real pain in the ass.
CHIUN: That is because it is the
shortest route to your brain!
- CHIUN: But we must hurry.
- REMO: What's the rush?
CHIUN: We must return in time to
see if Jim is truly going to walk.
REMO: What?
CHIUN: Or has the doctor
merely told him so,
because he hopes to get a new wing
for the hospital from his stepmother?
REMO: Chiun, you're incredible.
CHIUN: No...
I am better than that.
