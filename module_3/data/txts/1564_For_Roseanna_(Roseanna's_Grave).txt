Such a tragedy.
A whole family.
Who told them to ride a bicycle
50 feet in the air?
And they're from Roma.
They should
have been buried in Roma.
Just because they die here
doesn't give them the right
to clutter up our cemetery.
<i>- Buon Giorno!
- Buon Giorno!</i>
How long has the doctor
been here?
About 20 minutes.
I don't think it's serious.
That poor man.
He doesn't know whether to
pray for her to get better or worse.
You don't pray for someone
to get worse.
God doesn't like that.
So you know what God
likes and doesn't like?
He doesn't like me
to win at cards.
Hah hah hah!
What happened?
What's wrong?
She was coughing.
It's nothing, Marcello.
Cecilia shouldn't have
bothered the doctor.
So why did you?
She's my sister.
I have a right to call
when you're not here, as usual.
What do you mean, "as usual"?
Well, who's been
waiting tables all day?
I don't know, but there are
four men downstairs who need coffee.
Well, let them get their own.
I don't get paid for this, you know.
Marcello, was that necessary?
I'm sorry, but I see the doctor's car
and I get palpitations.
Take the poor man downstairs
and give him a drink.
He was up all night
at the Borglione house.
She had twins.
Healthy? No complications?
They're all fine. Relax.
How was the funeral?
It was a funeral...
a lot of tears, a lot of sighs,
and into the ground.
Now only three more graves left.
And Pavone and Aprea
are heading for two of them.
How is Pavone?
Any improvement?
There is nothing I can do for him.
You could call a specialist.
The only specialist he needs
is a stone mason.
What about Aprea?
Does he need blood?
I'll give him blood.
No, no, no, no, Marcello.
You can't give any more blood.
You gave blood yesterday.
You can't keep everyone
in the whole town alive.
I can try.
Roseanna's right.
You can't play God.
Anyone in Trevento could
drop dead at any minute...
heart attack,
lungs collapsing,
kidney failure,
brain tumor,
blood poisoning...
Then you're not doing your job!
What's the matter?
It's on the high end
of normal.
That good?
It means you're stressed.
I'll give you some pills.
You're a nice man, Sergio.
Have a Fernet-Branca.
I'd rather get paid.
Why don't people
pay their doctor?
Is it because
I don't leave anything behind?
You'd pay me if I delivered
tomatoes or veal chops.
People don't pay you
because they have no money
and they think you have a lot.
A gynecologist in Roma
has a lot.
A plastic surgeon in Milan.
I don't have enough to take my wife
to the sea for a few days...
...so you know where we're going?
- Where?
The attic of our house.
There's a window
that faces the sea.
It's 30 kilometers away,
but we are going to pray
for a very high tide.
Sergio, when you leave,
go out the back
and take a couple of eggs.
You owe me 10,000 eggs.
Then take the chicken
and bring it back when we're even.
<i>Corpus Cristo.</i>
- Roseanna.
- Father.
How are you doing?
We're still discussing that with God.
And I'm sure He's listening.
<i>Ciao.</i>
Eh, Cecilia, do you
remember me? Antonio.
I know who you are.
I thought you might have forgotten.
I've been away a long time.
- Law school, wasn't it?
- Yes.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
What is Marcello doing?
My sister is very ill.
She has a bad heart,
and her one wish is to be buried
in the cemetery,
and there's only
a few graves left.
And Marcello doesn't want
anyone else to die.
He doesn't want any accidents.
Helmet! Helmet!
Helmet, you guys!
You guys could get killed!
That is very moving.
It's absurd, and it's
all your uncle's fault.
My uncle?
Well, you know he owns the land
next to the cemetery,
and the church has offered
to buy, and he won't sell.
Not even half an acre.
This... this is the first
I've heard of it.
<i>Scusi. Scusi. I think I'd like
to go home now, eh?</i>
Of course.
<i>Buon Giorno.</i>
Antonio.
Stop it! Stop it!
Seatbelt! Seatbelt!
Seatbelt!
Ha ha ha ha! Seatbelt!
<i>Buon Giorno!</i>
Nice of you to join us.
What do you mean by that?
We need another waiter
more than we need a traffic cop.
Cecilia, you should remember
you're a guest in my house.
Oh, really?
I thought I was my sister's nurse
and unpaid waitress.
I didn't realize I was a guest.
Perhaps tomorrow
you bring me breakfast in bed
with fresh orange juice.
Hey, hey, why are you
always fighting with Cecilia?
She's family.
I don't want her to feel like family.
I want her to feel like a guest.
Like then I can ask her to leave.
Marcello! She gave up
her life in Rome to look after me.
I can look after you.
When did she last see a movie
or go out on a date, eh?
She's such a princess.
She says to me once,
"I don't want to be with a man
with dirt under his nails,"
which rules out almost
every man in this province.
Antonio has beautiful hands,
and he was making sheep's eyes
at her at church this morning.
Typical of your sister
to impress a Capestro.
- Too much oregano.
- She's a beautiful woman.
No. You are a beautiful woman.
You walk into a room,
and you take all the light, mmm.
Cecilia, she has a certain, uh...
you know,
sexy thing going for her.
Sexy?
She has, uh...
she has certain assets,
but what she's got,
she makes the men too aware of.
I didn't realize you were aware
of my sister's assets.
- I'm not.
- You just said you were.
How did this start?
You just said
you thought she was sexy.
L... I didn't.
I meant other men do.
Some men, not me.
So...
did you talk to Capestro again?
I've raised the offer...
50 million lire.
50 million lire? That is twice
what the land is worth.
Marcello!
<i>- More vino.
- No more vino!</i>
<i>- What do you mean, no more vino?
- You have a long drive home!</i>
You smoke too much.
Marcello!
So, can you go higher?
There is no more money.
We'll buy Emilio Fela's land
for a new cemetery.
It's up in the hills above the town.
But it's Roseanna's dying wish.
I know. I know.
I'm coming.
What are you doing?
I was just thinking
I'll never wear this again.
I wonder how much
I could get for it.
I won't hear of it.
It's a family treasure.
It belonged to your grandmother.
I'll sell a kidney.
It's only been
in the family 43 years.
In America, a person
can reserve a grave in advance.
Doesn't surprise me.
In America, you can do everything
without getting out of your car.
I always wanted to see New York.
I always promised to take you there.
And I will.
- First class?
- Of course first class.
We will need three seats...
one for you,
and two for my coffin.
We don't talk like that.
As long as there is life,
there are dreams.
All right. After New York,
we go to Paris.
It's full of French people.
Why put ourselves through that?
No, but really, what do you think
I could get for this, eh? Huh?
I don't know, eh, but for
100,000 lire, I'll give you a kiss.
What do you have for 200,000?
Eh, what's wrong?
Cecilia,
she can hear everything.
It's another reason
I hate guests in the house.
Who cares?
Don't think about it.
I can't. A moment ago
I was like a rod, and now...
Marcello, Marcello, slow down.
Slow down, eh?
It's the music.
Change the station.
The station...
the station...
Good morning, Gianna.
How is he?
I've been reading about emphysema.
You don't always die from it.
Once will be enough.
Italy has the worst air in Europe...
so many cars, motorbikes,
French restaurants.
You should move to Scottsdale.
- Where?
- It's the capital of Arizona.
Arizona? In America?
It's a big open space with no cars.
The air is clear, the days warm,
the nights cool,
the sky filled with stars.
So healthy.
If only we had the money...
Eh, I go and get the vase.
Think of it...
swimming pools,
cable television,
28 flavors of ice cream.
In two months,
you'll be bowling!
I don't want to be buried
under cactus.
I want to die in Italy.
Pavone, what are you doing?!
Are you crazy or what?
Are you trying to kill yourself
and everybody else?
That's oxygen in your nose!
I'm going to die anyway.
Yes, but you'll blow up
your nose, then your head,
then the whole hospital.
And in one minute you'll fill up
the old cemetery and the new one!
Gianna, you talk to him.
I just heard. I'm sorry.
- I gave him blood, you know.
- We are in your debt.
It's the least I could do.
He was a wonderful man.
When he worked for us as a waiter,
the tourists loved him.
The way he flirted with them,
they all felt
he wanted to marry them.
But of course he didn't.
You'd already captured his heart.
So when will they...
Soon.
May I say good-bye?
Good-bye, my old friend.
Godspeed till we meet again.
What?
- What?
- What?
Nothing.
I just thought I heard...
What?
I don't know.
It sounded like "bye-bye. "
Paolo! Paolo!
Go call the doctor, quick!
It was probably nothing.
Maybe I just got excited
when he squeezed my hand.
He squeezed your hand?
I don't want to
raise false hopes if it's time.
One second ago,
he squeezed his hand.
He spoke!
He's coming back to life!
It's a miracle!
He's said "bye-bye"!
- Maybe it was just a belch.
- It's a miracle!
Hello, my baby.
God gave you tightrope walkers
to play with, huh?
Don't stand under them.
All right, let me see...
The news... Lilia Palumbo
was confirmed on Sunday.
Oh, darling,
she looked so beautiful.
White dress.
Maybe a little bit
too much lace on it.
You know her mother.
Oh, my darling...
Little girl.
Your papa and I miss you so much.
Only the thought of being with you
makes me less afraid.
And I am going to be
right here next to you.
Your father is seeing to that.
Because he's a magnificent man.
A little crazy...
but magnificent.
<i>Puccini. La Traviata.</i>
Caruso?
Pavarotti.
What are you doing here?
The door was open.
Such a beautiful house.
I don't think I have ever been inside.
No accident.
State your business.
You have disliked me
for many years, Virgilio.
No secret.
I know the reason, of course.
You blame me for your fall.
What fall?
The cycle race.
The last bend
on the downhill run.
- It cost me the race.
- You could be right, huh.
May I sit?
This is not easy for me.
Lately I've been having dreams,
the same dream each time.
I see the race
as if it was yesterday.
I hear the crowd,
I see the bikes flashing by.
But, uh, when the winner
breaks the tape,
it is you, Virgilio.
I suppose my conscience
is telling me that, uh,
you could have won.
You were the best.
Why are you telling me
this now?
Maybe because of
my wife's illness.
A man becomes aware
of mortality,
a man wants to set
the record straight.
He doesn't want to live
with a lie in his heart.
Ahh.
This is for you, Virgilio.
You should have had it
all those years ago.
It's certainly Roseanna's illness
that brought you here,
but if you think I'm selling
my land to the church,
you are a fool,
as well as a bullshitter.
How can you turn down
50 million lire for half an acre of wheat?
You could travel with that money.
You could go to La Scala, Milano,
and see Pavarotti up close,
with all those big ladies
with fat chests.
I would rather ride
across my land.
If you don't own any,
you don't know what
it means to a man.
Just tell me this...
how much will it take?
More than you'll ever have.
Now... get out
before I piss in your cup.
You know something,
Capestro?
If I had padlocked both of my wheels
and ridden without a saddle,
I would have still whipped your ass.
There you go, laccoponi.
The sum total of your life.
90,000 lire?
I never walked around
with as little as this in my pocket.
Where's the rest of it?
That's all there was.
You're all thieves.
But we don't kidnap people
and cut off their ears.
One ear.
And the guy got it back.
So where are you going,
old man?
South, maybe.
Get some sun
on these old bones.
Get a chair on the beach,
a liter of wine, watch the sunset.
And dig up the ransom money?
What are you talking about?
They never found it.
You bet your ass the cops did,
and never filed a report.
Those sons of bitches
probably carved it up
and bought villas in Portofino,
and what have I got?
A watch that don't go...
a corkscrew...
and a ticket for shoe repairs
I took in 20 years ago.
You're gonna need them.
You shouldn't have gone there.
That man despises us.
How could you expose
yourself to his contempt?
You know why I went.
I'll try anything.
There are limits!
Where is your pride?
What's pride got to do with it?
I thought he might
listen to reason.
He is dead to reason!
He's not half the man you are!
Then why are we fighting?
We're not fighting!
I just get angry sometimes.
I get angry at the doctors.
I get angry at my body.
I get angry at God.
Oh, darling,
what's happening to us?
First we lose our daughter,
and now we're losing each other.
We'll never lose each other.
Listen to me, Marcello.
You are a man
who should be married.
I am married.
I don't want you to be alone.
I don't want you to end up
a lonely old man
with photographs and memories.
I want you to live.
I don't want to think about it.
I want you to think
about it, Marcello.
I'm worried about you.
I'm worried about Cecilia.
Don't worry about her.
She'll go back to Roma
and marry a hairdresser.
She's a beautiful woman.
She's sensitive.
She doesn't dust off shelves.
She would make you
a wonderful wife.
Did they change
your medication today,
or did you smoke that stuff
the Dutch tourists left behind?
I'm serious, Marcello.
I don't even like her.
Well, of course I like her.
She's your sister.
But not in that way.
You already said that
you thought that she was sexy.
I didn't. You tricked me.
And if you want me to marry again,
at least give me a choice.
Why? You have
someone in mind?
- Yes.
- Oh!
Is it that girl
who cleans your teeth?
He had breakfast,
bought some things in a pharmacy,
and now he's in a shoe store.
He's arguing.
He's making a move.
Police. The guy
who was just here...
did he pick something up?
He brought in a ticket
for shoe repairs from 20 years ago.
What did you tell him?
I could see you arguing
through the window.
I told him
they'd be ready Tuesday.
How much are the melons
today, Gigi?
500 to you.
1,200 to the tourists.
I'll have four.
<i>Mi scusi. They are selling
for 400 in Gevarro.</i>
How about it, Gigi?
400 each.
And who will you thank,
me or your lawyer?
I didn't know I'd hired one.
It's a deal then.
Today you look like a lawyer.
This is my first week.
What, looking after
your uncle's tax problems?
Listen, Cecilia,
I hope you won't let
your feelings for my uncle
affect your feelings for me.
Feelings?
I was hoping
we could have dinner tonight.
I have to work.
You're not making this
very easy for me.
Maybe another time?
Antonio.
What kind of fish do you like?
Signor Rossi, telephone.
Rossi. Hello?
Hello, Bruno.
It's Fredo laccoponi.
Fredo!
Where are you?
You... you'll be here when?
I'm gonna take a leak,
and then I'm getting
the 11:30 train to Roma.
Maybe you want
to call your wives,
tell them you won't
be home for dinner.
What will Marcello say
when you tell him
you invited
a Capestro to dinner?
He's not his son.
Only his nephew.
Think I put too much garlic
in this sauce?
You can't put
too much garlic in anything.
- You like him?
- Not especially.
Why did you invite him?
Because he likes me,
and maybe I can convince him
to talk some sense
into his uncle.
Shame on you.
When did you become
such a person?
When the family Tanzini
left the high wire.
Hmm.
<i>Maybe you and Marcello
are made for each other.</i>
Not again, Rosa, please.
Why? Why do you always
object to him that way?
He's a beautiful man.
The first time I came in here
when I was a girl,
he served me coffee,
I couldn't get my hand
to take it from him.
I froze.
You ever had that?
Just for a moment,
the world stops.
For you, Roseanna.
<i>Marcello doesn't even make
my world slow down.</i>
- What, you hate him?
- No.
All right. That's a start.
You haven't said
anything to him about this?
No, no, of course not.
Roseanna asked me,
and I told her the church
would have no problem
if you married her sister.
Is there anyone
she hasn't talked to about this?
I heard rumors.
You know something?
If I give the slightest sign
I thought it was a good idea,
she'd be furious.
I don't understand.
It's a test.
Celibacy is so uncomplicated.
Father, Marcello,
come quickly.
What is it?
It's Pasquale!
He climbed the tower!
And he's threatening to jump!
I'm gonna jump!
- Pasquale, what are you doing?
- I'll talk to him.
I'm gonna jump!
He's worried about his exams.
Pasquale, what's this nonsense
about your exams?
I know they're a pain in the ass,
but let me tell you something...
I've never passed
an exam in my life,
and look what I am today.
Okay, that wasn't
a very good example.
But you can be
anything you wish! Believe me!
But everybody hates me!
No, they don't! They don't!
Look at all these people!
We're all your friends!
And think of your father!
Only last night, he told me
how proud he is of you!
But my father's in Torino.
We spoke on the phone!
Listen!
Pasquale,
you come down! Now!
Okay.
What's going on?
Marcello, Marcello!
Roseanna, where are those pills
the doctor gave me?
What pills?
The ones to calm me down.
Which are mine,
and which are yours?
I can't see
without my glasses.
They're both mine.
I need them.
Do you know what those kids
did to my blood pressure?
I'm calling their fathers
and the school principal.
And then I come home and I find
a Capestro is coming to dinner.
Try the closet on the landing, hmm.
Roseanna, Roseanna,
Roseanna...
Why are you getting
your own towels?
You're a guest in my house.
Guests don't get their own towels.
Hmm.
Hmm.
<i>Mamma mia.</i>
You find them?
Are you angry because
her guest is a Capestro
or because he's another man?
Am I what? Are you crazy?
Then try to be nice.
She's doing this for me, Marcello.
Try to be charming.
And give him your good wine.
I'd sooner give him rat poison.
And then we lose another grave.
<i>- Yes?
- Bruno. It's me.</i>
Oh! Francesca.
<i>What's wrong?
You sound strange.</i>
No, no, no. I'm all right.
It's just...
this isn't a good time.
<i>Can we go to Sardinia?</i>
Of course. I'm excited.
I can't wait to see you.
Let me call you later.
<i>H'm not in.</i>
<i>- You'll be out?
- With my brother.</i>
<i>- Tomorrow, then.
- Ciao.</i>
You went away.
You saw the world.
Why did you come back here?
It's home.
I always missed it.
I couldn't wait to get away. I only
came back because of my sister.
Marcello's lucky to have
two such beautiful women in his life.
Yes, he often goes to church
to make a special offering of thanks.
So what do you think?
They're happy?
- Good. Good.
- Yeah?
- Oh, Marcello!
- We were having fun.
- This is not right.
- What is not right?
Cecilia prostituting herself
for your grave.
Maybe she'll succeed
where the priest and Marcello failed.
You know, a few years ago,
I wouldn't have
believed this possible.
You seemed so aloof and unobtainable,
surrounded by admirers.
- Where's this?
- At school.
I was very shy.
L... I wore glasses.
Of course, you were...
The Risotto alla Cecilia.
Her own recipe.
I'm very flattered.
I don't have a car,
and I can't afford a hotel room.
I'm sure I have something
for whatever you've got.
It's been a long time.
You might have to
remind me how it's done.
It'll come back to you.
- More wine, Antonio?
- Oh, I don't think so.
- I have to work tomorrow.
- For justice or for your uncle?
The trouble with working for my uncle
is he always expects a discount.
It's funny how the rich
always get a discount
and the poor
have to pay full price.
Well, I'm sure he trusts you.
He seems to trust so few people.
Cecilia.
Is this evening about the land?
What do you mean?
The candlelight. The music.
Is this for me or because
you think I'll influence my uncle?
It's for you.
Well, maybe I was hoping
it could be for both.
This is our best grappa.
20 years old.
We call it the piss of the goat.
So. How is it going
with you two, huh?
I think we understand
each other.
Fantastic. So you'll talk
to your uncle tomorrow.
Perhaps another time.
Good night, Cecilia.
Good night.
What's happening here?
Did I say something?
You're a fool, Marcello,
and he isn't.
And you know something?
I shouldn't have done this.
Antonio, I'm sorry.
Half an acre! That's all they want
off the miserable son of a bitch!
It's me. I can get a train
and be with you
in a couple of hours.
Why not?
I need time.
I made investments.
I need 24 hours
to give you cash.
Okay.
- It's good sauce, huh?
- Yes.
Cecilia made it.
She didn't make it.
You made it.
Will you stop this?
Marcello, come quick. It's Rossi.
He's drunk, and he's out of control.
He's crazy!
- Why does this happen to me?!
- What's going on?
I just had to be happy!
Stop breaking my dishes!
Here! Buy more dishes,
buy glasses, buy plates!
What's wrong with him?
It's something about a woman.
Bruno, you are distraught.
We're your friends.
What is this all about?
A man looks at his life
and wonders where
all his dreams went.
But you have a good life.
You have a good position.
I'm a big fish in a very small pond.
Nothing wrong with
living in a small pond.
Ask him about the mistress.
What? Is it true?
You have a mistress?
It's true.
Oh, she's beautiful.
Firm breasts...
soft thighs...
Bruno, you're
a widower, remember?
She sounds wonderful!
Bring her over! Bring...
<i>Oh Dio...</i>
She was my mistress
when Nina was alive.
<i>Si. Si.</i>
She was the girl in the beauty shop!
Francesca! I remember!
I remember!
My God.
So why are you acting like this?
Because she has ruined my life!
Aah!
Yaa!
He's mad!
Bruno! Bruno, wait!
Wait! You're
too drunk to drive.
You'll kill yourself.
What's the difference?
I'm gonna die anyway!
Not before Roseanna, you're not.
Stop torturing yourself.
See the priest,
do your penance,
then you can
call her your girlfriend.
Where is she?
In the apartment
I bought for her in Rome.
You bought her an apartment?
Yes.
And what, she still stays alone
and waits for you?
No, her brother moved in.
They're a very loving family.
But we go on trips.
This week we are
leaving for Sardinia.
Where did you find
the money for this?
Don't tell me. You've been
stealing from the bank.
Worse! Worse.
Worse?
Twenty years ago, I look after
some money for some kidnappers.
When they went to jail,
I was supposed to invest it,
build interest.
And for five years, I did that,
Marcello, I swear it. I swear it!
I believe you,
I believe you! Calm down!
Calm down!
Then I met Francesca,
and my life changed.
I told myself,
They'll die in jail.
Eh, so I started
spending money on her.
But one of them didn't die!
He's out,
and he wants his money!
How much are we
talking about?
750 million lire.
Shit, how much is left?
Not enough to make him happy.
He's going to kill me,
Marcello!
You've got to get away
from here.
You're right.
I'll see you later.
No!
Are you all right?
Can you stand?
I lost a shoe.
Oh, you're lucky
it wasn't your life.
Thank you, God.
Bruno!
Please don't be dead.
Please don't be dead.
Bruno...
Oh, what was that?
Oh, please.
I don't feel so good.
Oh, I'm going to find a phone
and call the hospital.
If you need blood,
I'll give you mine.
Marcello, I want to be buried
with Nina in the cemetery.
Oh, don't ask me that.
It's booked.
I have some money left,
money you could offer
to Capestro for his land.
Where?
First, you must promise to bury me
with my beloved Nina.
Oh, but there are
only three plots left.
Promise me, or that money
will rot where it's hidden.
Okay, I promise you.
- I promise you.
- Take an oath.
I take a solemn oath to bury you
in the cemetery with Nina.
So where is it?
It's under my wife.
Under your wife?
My dear Nina,
whose memory I shamed.
It's in her grave.
Bruno.
Bruno.
Bruno.
We still have to work on it.
But it will be
better on Sunday
if you move your lips,
Pasquale.
Father, something terrible
has happened.
I know, I know.
I'm on my way.
But how do you know?
The hospital telephoned.
At least his wife
had time to prepare herself.
Poor Gianna.
Are you
talking about Pavone?
Yes, and poor Aprea
will be next.
Then the cemetery will be full.
No, there are three places left.
Yes, but if
somebody else died.
Who else?
I don't know,
but, uh, these things happen.
Father, can you say
the last rites
after somebody is dead?
Well, I always
believed that the soul
does not leave the body
just like that.
There is time.
Good, but what do you say
when you give the last rites?
Marcello, don't worry.
When Roseanna's time comes,
I'll be there.
Thank you, but what do you say
if the time comes
and you're not there?
I say, "God bless this soul.
Take her into your kingdom. "
That kind of thing.
Thank you.
Forgive me, Nina.
It's only temporary.
God bless this soul
and take him into your kingdom.
He didn't get a chance
to atone for his sins,
but he would have atoned.
He wasn't a terrible person,
but as far as I know,
he was a good husband.
You've seen Francesca.
Who can blame him?
I forgot to say
this soul is Bruno Rossi.
Where have you been?
Where have I been?
You know where I've been.
I drove Rossi home.
That was four hours ago.
He needed to talk man to man.
About Francesca?
You shouldn't be up.
You need your sleep.
He has done something
he shouldn't.
- How do you know?
- I can tell.
I hope he's not cheating on you.
Cheating on me?
You're his wife. I'm only his guest.
Did he ever cheat on you?
I don't think so.
You know Marcello.
I know men.
Can you swear he never has?
Not with his whole body.
Just with his eyes.
With his lips, once or twice,
but never with the private.
You sure?
About the eyes, the lips,
or the private?
All of them.
Yeah, I'm sure.
I've seen him look.
Once I saw him kiss.
Mmm. But I knew in my heart
that the private
never left the barracks.
You all right, Roseanna?
Poor Rossi.
What a way to go.
He'd been drinking
all day and all night.
When the fire hit
all that alcohol... poof.
It must have been
quick and beautiful.
Ohh. Ahh.
I don't understand it.
There's no trace of a body.
Marcello, I hear you were
the last person to see Rossi.
Is that right?
Maybe, maybe not.
- But you drove him home.
- Yes.
And did you drive the car back?
No.
Look, he was drunk.
While he was asleep,
somebody stole the car.
Well, he's not in his house.
His bed was not slept in.
How do you explain that?
He got back in the car,
drove back to town,
but he was drunk,
and he crashed.
We found this
at the side of the road.
Look, when I was
driving him home,
he got desperate
and had to take a leak.
And that... that is when
he must have lost his shoe.
And maybe that is what
he was driving back to look for.
Then where is he?
Wandering about the countryside
with only one shoe.
Dazed, living on
rainwater and insects.
Please, mother,
you know it's for the best.
God doesn't want a man
to live that kind of death.
Milano 3, Roma 2.
Napoli 1, Torino 1.
What are you doing?
Reading him soccer results.
Why?
- He asked me to.
- He did?
Don't listen to him, mother.
The only thing alive
in this room is that machine.
She's right.
There are no life signs.
It's wrong for him
to lie here like a battery.
Life and death should be
in the hands of the Lord.
The Lord turned us on.
Only He should turn us off.
<i>Scusi.</i>
This is none
of your business, Marcello.
I love this man.
Of course his life is my business.
<i>Scusi.</i>
His death is mine!
Maybe we
should listen to Marcello.
- She's right.
- She's wrong.
<i>A mother is never wrong.
Scusi.</i>
For God's sake, you'll fuse
the whole bloody hospital.
Let him die, will you?
Good-bye, old friend.
I fought for you till the end.
Good-bye, my darling.
Good-bye, Papa.
Bye-bye.
He said bye-bye.
Bravo!
Sisters! Sisters!
Bye-bye.
No, I'm afraid I don't know
where Signor Rossi is.
Nobody does.
Please conclude
your summing up.
Are you finished?
Uh, no, sir.
The dog has been
a great source of comfort
to my client since his wife
tragically passed away six years ago,
and in my opinion,
he should not be put down.
He's wrong.
Bring my chickens back!
The dog must be kept chained.
Case dismissed.
Congratulations.
Yes. A major triumph
for justice and civil liberties.
So the dog is under
permanent house arrest, huh?
So why did you come?
I just wanted to apologize
for the other night.
Do you accept, or do you wish
to confer with someone?
Look, I'm sorry.
It's fine. It's okay.
Just for the record,
I was having a good time.
So was I.
And just for the record,
I did talk to my uncle
about the land.
That's not why I came.
But you know,
I'm not so sure it's about money.
It's about something else,
and he won't tell me what.
Well, it was nice of you to ask.
But tonight, we won't
talk about it anymore.
Tonight?
Unless you have another date?
- Amen.
- Amen.
Under your wife.
You can't have
put the money here.
What happened when you
bought your mistress a new dress
or took her on a trip?
Did you come here in the middle
of the night with a shovel? Huh?
Under your wife.
Under your wife.
What were you doing
back there?
I was talking to Rossi's wife.
You were talking to Rossi's wife?
Yes. I was telling her
about the accident.
But I said not to worry,
I'm sure he will turn up.
You're not going to work today.
- I have to.
- No! You're coming with me. Come.
What are you thinking?
I am thinking
that we're young,
and it's the first time
that we came up here.
And afterwards, you took my hand,
and you made me run
all the way down the hill with you.
Run with me again, huh?
You running?
I'm running.
- What?
- I tripped.
- Ahh!
- Ahh.
It's a long time
since we did nothing together.
Don't die, Roseanna.
Only if it's God's will.
I've never been so sure
about God's will
since He took our daughter.
This is a beautiful spot
for a cemetery. Huh?
Maybe they could move
Marcellina up here to be with me.
I asked. They said no.
Who said no? Why?
It's the law of the province.
Then we have to accept it.
I made a promise to you.
I know, but this is madness.
I don't want to kill you, too.
Why?
Who else have you killed?
Capestro would sell
if you offer him enough money.
There is no more money.
Francesca.
God, you really were afraid.
Nina.
Thanks for saving me
the trouble.
Oh, my God!
That's my money.
I've thought of nothing else
for 20 years,
except for wondering whether
that pig Rossi had spent it.
He might have spent
some of it.
Is this all?
<i>Jesucristo.
Where's the rest of it?</i>
I don't have it.
Don't shit me,
you son of a bitch.
He spent it.
He couldn't have spent
750 million lire!
Well, it's possible.
He has a girl. Look.
Expensive car.
Expensive clothes.
Expensive vacations.
And is he
with this whore now?
I'll find him.
I'll track him down.
But where is he?
Through here.
Don't screw with me.
I'm not in the mood.
This won't improve it.
You killed him
and took the money!
No, he killed himself
because there was no money,
because he knew
you were coming.
And this is how he choose to die?
He locks himself in a freezer?
Not exactly. I put him
in the freezer because...
It's another story.
You don't need to hear it.
For 20 years,
I've rotted my life away
with lowlifes and scumbags.
And you cheated me
out of my salvation!
Look, you have your freedom,
the sky, the trees,
the scent of the earth.
Money can't buy that.
So you thought you
could escape me by dying.
I don't think that was his plan.
He thought he'd
be safe from me in hell.
Well, he made a big mistake.
Here I come,
you son of a bitch.
No!
How could you do this to me?
What's wrong with you people?
Why? What?
L... what, uh!
God bless this soul
and take him to your kingdom.
You know the rest.
Marcello, I'm glad you're here.
I want to show you something.
- I really should get back.
- It won't take a moment.
The skid marks are here,
yet the car went
off the road over there.
What do you think?
- A deer.
- A deer?
Startled by his headlights.
He swerves across the road.
He thinks he hit the deer,
gets out to check,
forgets the hand brake,
the car rolls down the hill.
Then where is he?
We haven't found him
wandering around the countryside.
I have a theory
about that, too.
A man like Rossi spent his life
bound by office hours
and convention,
and then something snapped.
He's probably halfway to Tahiti,
where he will live in a hut
and paint nudes.
Nudes.
Nudes!
Marcello, where have
you been all day?
I've been attending
to business.
- Is Roseanna at the hospital?
- I don't think so.
When she gets back, tell her
I'm going to be late tonight.
You're going out again.
We're always busy tonight.
- I have something to do.
- Like what?
What's with all these questions?
You sound like my wife.
Marcello.
Marcello Beatto.
Who's that?
Francesca. Remember me?
Of course I remember you.
Bruno isn't here, you know.
What you doing here anyway?
He asked me to feed his cat.
His cat? I never knew
he had a cat.
Not many people do. He's kind of
private about things like that.
So where the hell is he?
I've been calling him for two days.
I don't know.
I thought he was with you.
He was supposed to be, eh?
I've been waiting
at Rome Airport for four hours.
So I've driven over
to this dump.
I will wipe my feet
on the way out.
So, he told you about me, huh?
He mentioned you, yes.
I'm surprised.
I was always
his little secret on the side.
Even after his sainted wife died,
he never wanted me to come here.
Maybe the place
is too full of memories.
It's too full
of mildew by the look of it.
<i>Cristo.</i>
This wine's awful.
Do you think he's found
another woman?
Do you think one piece of ass
is not enough for him?
Maybe he's on a cruise
with some little slut
from the bank.
Well, it's possible.
Women find him
very attractive.
<i>Excuse me.
Scusi. Hello!</i>
He's middle-aged,
he's balding, he's a banker!
I got to use the bathroom.
Uh, here.
Don't use the one downstairs.
It's not for a lady from Roma.
Ahh.
Where did you get that?
He must have bought it
for me, eh?
And if he didn't, the piece of shit,
he should have done.
Wait! I want to see you
with it on. Please.
Oh, you're right.
It's made for you.
You look superb,
like a movie star.
May I say one thing...
if Rossi's cheating on you,
the man is a fool.
If you're ever in Roma,
look me up.
<i>Ciao.</i>
What a bitch!
How did you find that?
I'm asking the questions here.
Where's it come from?
It was ransom money
from a long time ago.
Rossi gave it to me
just before he died.
- He died?
- Yes.
- How?
- He was hit by his car.
I didn't say anything.
He'd take up a grave.
Half the province
is looking for him.
- Where is he?
- I put him in his deep freeze.
What?
To keep him fresh,
but don't worry,
I promised to bury him
next to his beloved Nina.
Maybe not next to her.
Maybe on the top.
You're going to bury a man
on top of his wife?
Well, it's not
an entirely unusual position.
Marcello,
what are you thinking of?
If he's not found,
he'll be a missing person.
There'd be no inheritance
for his children.
And he's got to have
a proper Christian burial.
Roseanna's right.
You can't deny a Catholic that.
- You heard all this?
- I couldn't help it.
God damn it!
I hate having people in this house
who are not married to me!
Quiet, quiet, quiet!
We're all in this together.
Yes, but what
are we going to do?
He's been in the freezer
for two days.
First thing we'll do
is pay a visit to the doctor.
Roseanna,
the timing on a death certificate,
it is crucial.
It has to be precise.
What difference does it make
if it's a few days off?
He's dead.
He can't come back to life.
I could lose my license,
my patients.
Nobody pays you
anyway, Sergio.
Why would Marcello do this?
You know why.
I'm sorry, Roseanna.
It's too important a document.
It's a piece of paper.
Do you think
a death certificate
should cause unnecessary
suffering to the living?
You look a little tired.
<i>You look exhausted.</i>
Sergio, take a vacation, eh?
You and Isabella.
Go to Capri.
In our dreams.
What if we settle our account?
Did you bring the chicken?
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
I want to thank you, Cecilia.
I can't think of another girl
who would have done this.
I think it helps to have company
when you're defrosting a corpse.
I have a lot to thank you for.
And I'm sorry for
what I said last night
about not wanting you
in my house.
I understand. It's difficult
when people live that close.
Do you hear a lot
of what we talk about?
I know what Roseanna
has in mind for you and me.
Oh, that.
Look, I have to tell you...
Listen, you don't have to
apologize for not wanting me.
Of course I want you!
Any man would.
What am I saying?
Listen, with people
it's a question of chemistry,
and it's not there.
Are you saying
I have no chemistry?
No, Marcello. You could
ignite a thousand hearts.
But admit it, there's
nothing between you and me.
I suppose so.
It's a relief, huh?
Definitely.
Now we can be friends, huh?
That would be nice.
How is he?
Medium rare.
Another hour.
So...
what were you
doing here, Marcello?
I came to feed the chickens,
like a friend would.
Then I saw him.
Was a terrible shock.
Then why is he sitting there?
It was his favorite spot.
Think of it. He knows
his life is slipping away,
and this is the picture
he wants to take with him.
Ah, yesterday you said
he was halfway to Tahiti.
And the day before,
I told you he was wandering about,
dazed and confused.
And I was right.
What about the sock?
What about it?
Does it look like
the sock of a man
who's been wandering
around the countryside?
My friend is dead,
and you're worrying about...
the state of his socks?
Doctor, you're the expert.
In your professional opinion,
what time did he die?
I'd say...
a few hours ago.
I'd like to call an ambulance.
Very well.
- I won't be gone long.
- Where are you going?
Not to the hospital,
looking like that.
Roseanna.
May I come in?
Yes.
It wasn't easy for me
to come here.
This place hasn't changed
in 20 years.
There was never a woman
worth changing it for.
You could have been
the richest woman in Trevento,
and you chose a cyclist with a bar.
Virgilio,
we cannot argue fate.
Mine was Marcello.
And see how fate turns around.
He took the one thing I wanted,
and I have
the one thing he wants.
Then for the sake of the feelings
that you once had for me,
give it to him.
And will you give me back
20 years of happiness?
Virgilio,
I beg you,
let the land go.
All right.
But first
I want an admission,
an admission
that you made a mistake,
that when you turned me down,
it was not only an insult,
it was... stupid.
That you married a man
who had nothing 20 years ago
and has nothing now.
That if you married me,
you would have had...
everything.
That I could have provided you
with better doctors than he did,
and that your child
would still be alive.
Admit that.
Then you can have your land.
This is so sad.
You are so sad.
Look at this house
that you live in.
There is no soul.
There is no joy.
There is no peace.
My life with Marcello
has been filled with these things.
Step outside
of this opera you are living in.
It is not me
you are angry with.
It's you.
Amen.
He had a good life.
His chickens,
custom-made shirts,
and a mistress.
I'm not sure
she was a blessing.
She didn't send flowers.
Of course not.
His children were there.
He'll be missed.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
We need a fourth for cards.
You look beautiful
in black, Cecilia.
It's just as well. It's the color
this town wears most.
Strange way to die,
don't you think?
No.
Sergeant Baggio
had a word with me about it.
Why?
I'm a lawyer with some
criminal experience.
He thinks we don't know
the whole story.
- What does he think?
- Between ourselves?
He thinks the Mafia
are involved.
Roseanna, what's wrong?
Nothing. It's just
one of my bad days.
Do you need a pill?
I just took one.
Do you need the doctor?
He's in the bar.
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Roseanna, I'm going to
take the rest of Rossi's money
and offer it to Capestro.
It's no use, Marcello.
Listen,
I have something to tell you.
You know that I adore you.
The first time I met you,
you touched my soul.
But there was a time
before I knew you.
Is it possible?
You know that I lived
on the Capestro estate
with my parents,
who were servants there.
I was 16
when Virgilio came back
from the university.
And he was...
he was very handsome,
with all the arrogance
of wealth and youth.
I don't think I'm going to like
what you're going to tell me.
No, You're not.
He seduced you.
Not exactly.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marcello.
I was very young,
and I was flattered
by the attention of such a man.
He asked me to marry him.
Why didn't you?
I met you.
It's that simple.
So, you see,
this is the anger
that he has in his heart for you,
and money cannot
make this go away.
You've done
everything you could.
You have to let go now.
Amen.
Capestro!
Half an acre.
That's all that was
ever asked of you.
Not only for my wife,
but for all
the people of Trevento
who wanted to be buried
where their ancestors were.
If you have business with me,
you come to me on a Monday
and you talk to my lawyer.
In front of God,
you're a sick man,
consumed with
jealousy and hatred
because of the woman
you couldn't have.
Please, stop this.
Stop this right now.
I would be buried
10,000 kilometers from my daughter
before I would take one thing
from the hand of this man.
If you were half of what you are
and he was twice what he is,
you would still be ten...
you would st...
you would still be
ten times the man he is!
Get the doctor! Quickly!
I'm here, Marcello!
I'm here.
Roseanna.
Roseanna.
I'm very sorry to tell you,
but Roseanna,
my wife,
my beloved,
the most wonderful woman
that ever lived,
has passed away
This is not the time for weeping,
it's a time for joy,
because she will be buried
in the last grave
of the cemetery with her...
Marcellina.
This she wanted more than life.
This God has granted her.
This makes me happy.
Roseanna has her dying wish.
I would have gone,
but I thought
they wouldn't want me.
You're probably right.
I want you to draw up papers
transferring the necessary land
from my estate to the church.
A deed of gift.
Maybe now you'll
hate that family less.
I also want you to know
I'm in love with Cecilia...
and I intend to ask her
to marry me.
Antonio...
I loved her.
It ruined my life.
Hey, Cecilia!
Hey, Cecilia!
Cecilia!
- Where is everybody?
- Gone.
Well, gone where?
Marcello wanted to get away.
He has a cousin in Como.
Who can blame him?
- And Cecilia?
- She took him to the station.
I think she is going with him.
Why not?
It was her sister's wish.
Cecilia!
- Antonio.
- Marcello, forgive me.
Is this true?
Is she going with you?
What is this all about, Antonio?
You could at least
have said good-bye!
There were so many things
I wanted to say to you,
and I waited, out of respect,
until your sister had passed on.
Why don't you put this in a letter?
You're doing this out of duty!
You don't love each other!
And I do love you, Cecilia.
I really do.
You are wrong, Antonio.
We love each other
very much.
Roseanna, I mean...
what's going on?
<i>Ay yi! We were
almost on the train!</i>
I have my grave reserved for me,
but it can wait
until I am ready for it.
In the meantime, Marcello
and I have some living to do.
And Cecilia?
I mean, where is she?
Keeping out of the way.
You can see her tonight.
It's our secret,
and if you care
about Cecilia, be part of it.
Have a good life, huh?
Marcello.
Menu, sir?
No, thank you. We'll be dining
on the plane to New York.
You say that as if
you do this all the time,
and you've never been
on a plane in your life.
- We did it!
- Yes!
But the first thing we have to do
when we go to New York
is find a church and confess
to the priest for being so wicked.
Have we been so wicked?
Of course, or else
it wouldn't feel so good.
Tell me something...
is the mayor of New York
still Italian?
Why would anybody want
to stop being Italian?
