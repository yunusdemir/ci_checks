A judgment reflected
in its relatively poor showing
at the box office.
In which field, of course,
"Thunderball"
was a notable success.
<i>People think it's all

I'd say, in those days,

All the fucking chemicals.
No fucking way.
It's a waste of your life, Mark,
poisoning your body
with that shite.
Every chance you've had, son,
you've blown it.
Stuffing your veins
with that filth.
<i>From time to time, even I
have uttered the magic words.</i>
Never again, Swanney.
I'm off the scag.
Are you serious?
Yeah. No more.
I'm finished with that shite.
It's up to you.
I'm going to get it sorted out,
get off it for good.
I sure have heard
that one before.
The Sick Boy method.
Well, it really worked
for him, eh?
He's always been lacking
in moral fiber.
He knows a lot
about Sean Connery.
That's hardly a substitute.
You need one more hit.
No, I don't think so.
For the long night

Mikey. Hi.
Yeah, it's Mark Renton.
Look, could you help me out?
<i>This was typical
of Mikey Forrester.</i>
What the fuck are these?
<i>Under the normal run of things...</i>
<i>I would have had nothing to do
with the cunt,</i>
<i>but this was not
the normal run of things.</i>
Opium suppositories.
Ideal for your purposes.
Slow release.
Bring you down gradually.
Custom-fucking-designed
for your needs.
I want a fucking hit!
That's all I've got, man.
Take it or leave it.
Are you feeling better now?
For all the good
they've done me,
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.
<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>
<i>The heroin from my last hit
is fading away.</i>
<i>The suppositories
have yet to melt.</i>
Ohh!
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>
<i>I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.</i>
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,</i>
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,</i>
<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>
Ohh.
Fuck.
Ohh! Oh!
Ahh.
Yes, a fucking Godsend!
<i>And now.</i>
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>
<i>The downside of coming off junk</i>
<i>was I knew I would mix
with my friends</i>
<i>in a state of full
consciousness.</i>
<i>It was awful.</i>
<i>They reminded me of myself.</i>
<i>I could hardly bear
to look at them.</i>
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.</i>
<i>He came off junk
at the same time.</i>
<i>Not because he wanted to.</i>
<i>Just to annoy me.</i>
<i>Just to show me
how easily he could do it,</i>
<i>thereby downgrading
my own struggle.</i>
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>
<i>he insisted on telling me
once again</i>
<i>about his unifying theory
of life.</i>
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.
What do you mean?
Well, at one point,
you've got it.
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.
All walks of life.
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.
Lou Reed? Some of his
solo stuff's not bad.
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?
In your heart, you kind of know
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.
So who else?
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.
Okay, okay, so what is the point
you're trying to make?
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.
And what about
"The Untouchables"?
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy Award?
That means fuck all.
It's a sympathy vote.
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?
Yeah.
That's your theory?
Yeah.
Beautifully fucking illustrated.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Do you see the beast?
Have you got it in your sights?
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.
This should present
no significant problems.
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.
No! Get off!
<i>Without heroin,
I attempted to lead a useful</i>
<i>and fulfilling life
as a good citizen.</i>
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.
"This cunt is not trying."
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?
But then again, try too hard...
You might get the fucking job.
Exactly.
Nightmare.
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.
Try some of this, Spud.
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.
There's too much discrimination
in this town.
They're both schools.
We're all in this together.
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.
People get hung up on details.
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?
It could be six.
Could be none.
It's not important.
What is important
is that I am, yes?
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you
lied on your application?
No!
Yes, only to get my foot
in the door.
Showing initiative and that.
You were referred by
the Department of Employment.
There was no need for you to get
your "foot in the door,"
as you put it.
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.
Mr. Murphy,
what exactly attracts you
to the leisure industry?
In a word, pleasure.
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.
Yes, I am.
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.
We'll let you know.
The pleasure was mine.
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.</i>
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>
Picture the scene.
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.
Me and Tommy playing pool.
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.
So it comes to the last shot.
The deciding ball
of the whole tournament.
I'm on the black,
and he's in the corner,
looking all fucking
biscuit-arsed,
when this hard cunt comes in.
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.
Starts staring at me.
Looking at me,
right fucking at me,
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."
You know me.
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.
So I squares up, casual like.
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?
Shites it.
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.
And after that,
well, the game was mine.
<i>And that was it.</i>
<i>That was Begbie's story.</i>
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.</i>
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>
<i>You always got the truth
from Tommy.</i>
<i>It was one of
his major weaknesses.</i>
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,</i>
<i>and he never cheated
on anyone.</i>
It was Wednesday morning.
We were in the volley
playing pool.
That much is true.
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,
never mind pot a ball.
I'm doing my best to lose,
you know.
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.
Every time Begbie goes near
the table, he fucks it up.
Oh, fuck's sake.
So he's got the hump, right?
But finally I manage to set it
up so all he has to do
is to pot the black
to win one game
to salvage a little bit of pride
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.
And it all goes wrong, big-time.
Fuck!
Aah!
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar
and accuses him of putting him
off by looking at him.
Can you believe it?
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.
Fuck off!
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.
Then I thought
he was going to do me.
The beggar's
fucking psycho, man.
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?
Can I borrow this?
<i>What indeed could one do?</i>
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.</i>
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.</i>
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.</i>
Nobody move!
That lassie got glassed,
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.
Who the fuck are you?
Yes!
Ohh!
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!
Oh, Lizzy!
Oh, Lizzy!
Oh, Tom, come in me!

He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,
but I was very impressed
with the capable manner
in which you dealt with that.
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."
Thanks.
- What's your name?
- Diane.
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.
Great.
What?
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.
Do you find that this approach
usually works?
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,
but if I'm prepared to
take a chance,
I might just get to know
the inner you.
Witty, adventurous, passionate,
loving, loyal.
Taxi!
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.
But, hey, don't us girls
just love that?
Well, what's wrong, boy?
Cat got your tongue?
I left something.
Are you getting in or not, pal?
Do you understand?
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.
Generous but firm.
What?
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.
Right?
Diane.
Shh!
What?
Shut up!
Wake up, Spud.
Wake up.
Sex.
Casual sex.
Tommy, let's put the tape on.
Now?
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.
So let's see what I'm missing.
Not much.
Pushed forward again.
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,
picking it up from the outside.
I think he wants to go himself.
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.
And he scores!
Oh, what a magnificent goal!
Gemmill at his very best!
What a penetrating goal
that was!
I haven't felt that good
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.
You can't sleep here.
- What?
- Out.
Come on!
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.
It's up to you.
And don't make any noise.
Jesus!
What do you mean, "It's gone"?
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!
I might have returned it
by mistake.
Returned it?
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?
The fucking video shop?
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

Morning.
Good morning, Spud.
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.
It does a man good to cut loose
once in a while.
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.
I'll put the sheets
in the machine.
No, no, no, I'll wash them.
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.
It's no problem for me.
I'd rather take care
of it myself.
Honestly, it's no problem.
Really, no!
Spud, they're my sheets!
I don't see why not.
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.
What? Holding hands?
Not holding hands.
In that case, you can do it.
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.
Do you know what they'd do
to me inside?
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.
I'll see you around then.
Now what?
We're going for a walk.
What?
A walk!
Where?
There!
Are you serious?
Well, what are you waiting for?
Tommy.
This is not natural, man.
It's the great outdoors!
It's fresh air.
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,
but there's really no need
to take it out on us.
Doesn't it make you proud
to be Scottish?
It's shite being Scottish!
We're the lowest of the low.
The scum of the fucking Earth.
The most wretched,
miserable, servile,
pathetic trash that was ever
shat into civilization.
Some people hate the English.
I don't.
They're just wankers.
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.
We're ruled by effete arseholes.
It's a shite state of affairs
to be in, Tommy,
and all the fresh air
in the world
won't make any fucking
difference!
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.
<i>At or around this time,</i>
<i>Spud, Sick Boy, and I made
a healthy, informed,</i>
<i>Democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible.</i>
<i>It took about 12 hours.</i>
<i>It looks easy, this,
but it's not.</i>
<i>It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.</i>
<i>But living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>
Ursula Andress.
The quintessential Bond Girl.
That's what everyone says.
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.
Beautiful, exotic,
highly sexual,
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.
Shite.
I mean, let's face it, mate.
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,
she'd shag
the whole fucking lot of us.
Well done.
I knew he was gonna do that.
Lizzy's gone, Mark.
She's gone
and fucking dumped me.
It was that videotape
and that Iggy Pop business
and other sorts of shit.
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.
I said to her,
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"
But no way, no fucking way.
Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?
What a total fucking misnomer.
I mean, I wouldn't touch her
with yours.
I want to try it, Mark.
You're always going on about how
it's the ultimate hit.
Better than sex.
Come on, man,
I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.
I've got the money.
Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?
Personality.
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.
Like heroin.
I mean, heroin's got great
fucking personality.

that it would all go wrong.</i>
<i>Because no matter how much you
stash or how much you steal,</i>
<i>you never have enough.</i>
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.</i>
Because shoplifting is theft,
which is a crime,
and despite
what you may believe,
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.
Heroin addiction
may explain your actions,
but it does not excuse them.
Mr. Murphy,
you are a habitual thief,
devoid of regret and remorse.
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.
Mr. Renton, I understand
that you have entered
into a program of rehabilitation
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.
The suspension of your sentence
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.
Should you stand guilty
before me again,
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.
Thank you, Your Honor.
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.
<i>What can you say?</i>
<i>Well,
Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!
You better clean up your act.
Cut that shite out forever.
You listen to Francis.
He's talking sense.
Fucking right I am.
See, inside, you wouldn't last
two fucking days.
There's better things
than the needle, Rents.
Choose life.
I remember
when you were a wee baby.
Oh, mama's little baby loves.
<i>♪ Shortening, shortening ♪</i>
<i>♪ Mama's little baby loves

I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.
Well, it's not our fault!
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.
That was that fucking cunt.
I'll get the drinks.
Aye.
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.</i>
<i>Here I was surrounded by my
family and my so-called mates,</i>
<i>and I've never felt so alone,
never in all my puff.</i>
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program.</i>
<i>The state-sponsored addiction.</i>
<i>Three sickly sweet doses</i>
<i>of methadone a day
instead of smack.</i>
<i>But it's never enough.</i>
<i>And at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.</i>

We'll help you, son.
You'll stay here with us
till you get better.
We're gonna beat this together.
Maybe I should go back
to the clinic.
No.
No clinics, no methadone.
That only made you worse.
You said so yourself.
You lied to us, son,
your own mother and father.
- You could bring us jellies.
- No!
You're worse coming off that
than heroin.
- Nothing at all.
- It's a clean break this time.
You're staying here where

I appreciate

Question number one.
The human immunodeficiency virus
is a...
Retrovirus?
Retrovirus is the right answer!
It's a mug's game, Mrs. Renton.
I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself.
But there comes a time
when you have to turn your back
on that nonsense
and just say no.
Just say no.

<i>Since I last saw him,</i>
<i>Sick Boy had reinvented himself

Good chips.
I can't believe you did that.
I got a good price for it.
Rents, I need the money.
It was my fucking telly!
Well, if I'd known you were
going to get so humpty,
I wouldn't have bothered.
Fucking rented, anyway.
You going to eat that?
Have you got a passport?
Why?
I met this bloke.
Runs a hotel, a brothel.
Loads of contacts.
Does a nice sideline
in punting British passports
to foreigners.
Get you a good price.
And why would I want
to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
<i>I had to get rid of them.</i>
<i>Sick Boy didn't do his drug
deal, and he didn't get rich.</i>
<i>Instead, he and Begbie
hung around my bed-sit</i>

- Aah!
- Aah!
<i>And that was that.</i>
<i>But by then we had another
reason to go back.</i>
<i>Tommy.</i>
Tommy knew he'd got
the virus, like,
but he never knew
he'd gone full-blown.
What was it,
pneumonia or cancer?
No, toxoplasmosis.
Sort of like a stroke.
How's that?
He wanted to see Lizzy again.
She wouldn't let him
near the house.
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.
I bet Lizzy told him
where to stick it.
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.
Get the fuck, right.
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.
You can imagine what happened.
To those of us
gathered here today,
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.
- What?
- Thomas was a son.
The thing was neglected.
Pissing and shitting
all over the place.
Tommy's lying about,
fucked out of his eyeballs
on smack or downers.
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.
A loving man with a great lust
for life.
Neither did I.
What is it?
Fucking horrible.
It's like an abscess
in your brain.
Fucking hell.
Then what happened?
He starts getting
these headaches,
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.
And then he has a stroke.
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.
He'd been dead for ages
before the neighbors
complained about the smell
and got the police
to break down the door.
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.
He has gone from us,
but we have many things
to remember him by.
The kitten was fine.

- Tommy.
Did you tell him yet?
On you go.
What?
There's this mate of Swanney's.
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.
Aye.
Well, he's come into some gear.
A lot of gear.
How much gear?
About two kilos, so he tells me.
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,
where he met
two Russian sailors.
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,
there and then, like.
So he wakes up the next morning,
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.
He wants rid of this, right?
So?
So he met me, and I offered
to take it off his hands
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.
Ho ho-ho-ho!
We've just come back
from Tommy's funeral,
and you're talking
about a scag deal?
Aye.
What was your price?
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?
We're £2,000 short.
Well, that's tough.
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.
Aye, you fucking do.
I've seen your bank statement.
For fuck's sake.
£2, 133.
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?
What the fuck
are you boys on, eh?
Spud, you've already been
to jail.
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?
I just want the money, Mark.
If everybody keeps
their mouth shut,
there'll be no cunt
going to jail.
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running</i>
<i>through my mind about

<i>Things I didn't want to talk
to anyone about,</i>

<i>No one told me

<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.</i>
<i>Sick Boy was too careful
these days.</i>
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,</i>
<i>and I did what had to be done.</i>
It's good.
Oh, it's really fucking good.
Mmm. Ohh.
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.</i>
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.</i>
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.</i>
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams</i>
<i>being perpetrated with three
of the most useless</i>
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups
in town.</i>
<i>I knew what was going on
in his mind.</i>
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.</i>
<i>One way or another.</i>
<i>He had to.</i>
<i>If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,</i>
<i>on top of
that armed-robbery shit,</i>
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>
<i>Begbie was hard,
but not so hard</i>
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.</i>
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>
<i>But let's be clear about this.</i>
<i>There's final hits
and final hits.</i>
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>
Did you bring the cards?
- What?
- The cards.
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.
Well, I've not brought them.
Fucking boring after a while
without the cards.
I'm sorry.
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!
Christ.
These are your friends, right?
These are the guys
I told you about.
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.
You didn't get followed,
did you?
We didn't get followed.
Okay.
All right.
Aye.
<i>Straightaway he clocked us
for what we were.</i>
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>
Excuse me, gentlemen.
So how much would you like
for this?
£20,000.
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than £ 15,000.
<i>This was a real drag to him.</i>
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.</i>
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?</i>
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!</i>
Well, £ 19,000.
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to £ 19,000.
Well, fucking £ 16,000, then.
Okay.
Well, fucking £ 16,000
it is, then.
These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.
Here's two.
That's four.
<i>We settled on £16,000.</i>
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.
Fucking brand-new,
by the way.
Okay.
- Yes!
- Yes!
Fucking...
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.</i>
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.</i>
<i>Like it meant something.</i>
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.</i>
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?
For four fucking grand?
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
I don't know, man.
I'm gonna get something
for my ma.
Get some good speed, no bicarb.
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.
Shag her senseless.
No, man!
True love.
True love.
Hey, but I could handle
some hot sex
with a Jewish Princess.
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!
If you're gonna waste it
on a bird,
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.
Now get the drinks.
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.
Okay.
Same again?
Right.
I'm off for a pish.
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.
I'll be right fucking after you.
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.
By the way,
see when I get back.
Be halfway down the street
with the money.
Fucking kill you.
I thought you might, Franco.
I thought you might.
Are you game for it?
What?
Well?
Are you serious?
Don't know.
What do you think?
Still here, I see.
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?
Why not?
I know I would.
Where's Franco?
For fuck's sake!
Sorry, mate.
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.
Fuck off.
Aah.
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!
Aah!
Fuck's sake!
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!
You were in my fucking way.
Help!
Oh, no.
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?
You?
You?
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring me down
a fucking smoke.
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

<i>Now, I've justified this
to myself in all sorts of ways.</i>
<i>It wasn't a big deal,
just a minor betrayal.</i>
<i>Or we'd outgrown each other.
You know, that sort of thing.</i>
<i>But let's face it.
I ripped them off.</i>
<i>My so-called mates.</i>
<i>But Begbie. I couldn't give
a shit about him.</i>
<i>And Sick Boy.
He'd have done the same to me</i>
<i>if he'd only thought
of it first.</i>
<i>And Spud. Well, okay,
I felt sorry for Spud.</i>
<i>He never hurt anybody.</i>
Bastard!
Bastard!
Fuck! Fuck!
All right, move away, people.
What's going on in there?
Open up.
Open up now!
Bastard!
Bastard!
<i>So why did I do it?</i>
<i>I could offer
a million answers, all false.</i>
<i>The truth is
that I'm a bad person,</i>
<i>but that's gonna change.</i>
<i>I'm going to change.</i>
<i>This is the last
of that sort of thing.</i>
<i>I'm cleaning up
and I'm moving on.</i>
<i>Going straight
and choosing life.</i>
<i>I'm looking forward to it
already.</i>
<i>I'm going to be just like you.</i>
