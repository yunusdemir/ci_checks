# Always late
# With your kisses
# Won't you come to my arms,
sweet darlin',
# and stay?
# Always late
# With your kisses
# Why, oh, why do you,
# want to do me this way?
# How long do you think
I can wait
# When you know
you're always late
# Always late
# With your kisses
# Why, why, why do you,
# want to do me this way?
<i>That was Lefty Frizzell's
"Always Late with Your Kisses. "</i>
<i>Before that,
we heard Buck Owens.</i>
<i>Get your waders out.</i>
<i>It's seven days before the state
officially drowns Northfork.</i>
<i>It's sunny skies
with the highs being 51...</i>
"To the loving O'Brien family.
"It has been brought
to our attention
"that the remains of a
Mrs. Patricia O'Brien
"have yet to be excavated.
Please make arrangements
immediately. "
<i>The hardworking citizens
of Northfork</i>
will be able to have
their much-needed power...
as well as...
the pleasure of the recreation
that this body of water will provide.
Let me add this:
The good people
of Northfork
will be able to have their cake
and eat it, too.
Two, three...
<i>Where are we going to start...
right in here?</i>
<i>- Where should we start?
- Let's start right in here.</i>
<i>Then the water
shall become a flood</i>
<i>and destroy all flesh...</i>
<i>and the bow
shall be in the cloud,</i>
<i>and I will look upon it,
and I will remember...</i>
<i>the everlasting covenant</i>
<i>between God and
every living creature...</i>
<i>of all flesh that
is upon the earth.</i>
<i>And that's what
we have here.</i>
<i>Our town is dying.</i>
<i>I have seen the concrete</i>
monument...
the headstone for the
town for Northfork.
This dam gate will close...
the water will rise,
over the plains,
and cover our businesses...
our homes...
and our well-being.
<i>We have lost Northfork.</i>
<i>We will be losing
our dear son...</i>
<i>but we will gain the hope,</i>
<i>the courage...</i>
to move to a
higher ground.
We're all angels.
It is what we do,
with our wings...
that separates us.
What are we waiting for?
Well, Mr. and Mrs. Hadfield.
Father, his health isn't
getting any better.
Rose has had to stay
by his bed.
All the doctors
have left Northfork.
You're returning him then?
He's a very ill child.
We cannot make the journey
with him in this condition.
We apologize, Father.
We appreciate
your honesty,
- and will ask for forgiveness.
- Forgiveness?
Let's be honest, Father.
You gave us a sick child.
- I gave you an angel.
- You're misunderstanding us.
We love Irwin.
"Halo Home"
is deeply regretful...
about the grief Irwin has
brought to your family.
God bless.
Have a nice journey.
This is wrong.
This is just downright wrong.
When did you
get this letter?
I received the final
notice yesterday.
I don't like this
damned cake.
This is wrong
on every level.
Yeah.
Where did my parents go?
We don't want to go
where they're going.
You rest now.
Father, everybody's leaving.
Oh, I know.
I know.
Oh, let's stay here.
Huh?
You're the caretaker?
Yes?
Cookie takes care of the yard.
Maybe you can help me?
Who are you looking for?
A relative.
Hold still.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Eddie, Arnold.
Walter, Willis, Marvin, Matt.
Marvin, Matt, Walter, Willis.
Marvin, Matt, Eddie, Arnold.
Anybody voted for him voted
themselves right out of Northfork.
Have a good journey.
Nice concrete cork.
I have done countless evacs.
And as long as
I've been doing this job,
it is never come down
to 48 hours before.
That's two days, and by the time I'm
through with you, it's gonna be 47.
So you'd better listen up.
And remember
one very important thing.
Despite the tertiary
inconveniences
we're putting
these people through,
we're giving
them new power.
All right.
Matt...
Marvin.
Please go pay a visit
to the Youngs.
Eddie, Arnold.
Arnold.
I want you to get down
to Hungry Horse Road,
and I want you to nail Jigger,
do you understand?
You betcha.
Now, you can't go into this
treating it like
you're throwing out homesteaders,
poor old homesteaders.
Look at it like you're saving
- some poor dumb son of a bitch
from drowning. - Mr. Rudolph.
It says here that,
uh, there has been
some previous attempts
at evacuation.
Walter, Willis.
Stallings.
Highway 93.
Remember, the one single
most important thing:
"It is not our business,
to tell anybody else theirs. "
You just come in like
you're their guardian angel.
You give them wings, and then you
move 'em on up into higher ground.
Good luck now, gentlemen.
<i>In the early 1800s,</i>
<i>European settlers
named Northfork</i>
<i>after the river
that embraced their town.</i>
Word traveled
around the world
that angels roamed
these plains like bison.
I find the humor quite parched.
19th century.
A remarkable piece.
Artist used the finest oils.
Organic pigments.
Magnificent.
The artist has
a religious vocabulary.
He used the luxuriantly
white wings of the swan.
Fascinating representation
of the angelic messenger.
Lovely bird.
If I do recall correctly,
the Celts employed the majestic
swan, as their sacred symbol
and messenger
to the other world.
Their link that existed
between the realm of their gods,
and the realm of humans.
Very relatable.
I can only speculate...
that the man with swan wings,
or in this painting,
the wild bird man,
is a creation...
of the overtaking
by Christianity.
Bless the imagination.
# Walk, walk, walk
# Walk, walk, walk
# Just a closer walk with Thee
- It's wrong.
- It's just downright wrong.
- 702.
# For Thou art strong
Departed.
# Jesus keep me from all wrong
It's wrong,
and I'm not gonna do it.
And neither should you.
It's death till you part.
- She's your mother.
# I'll be satisfied as long
# As I walk
- 705.
# Let me walk close to Thee
- Departed.
# Just a closer walk with Thee
# Grant it, Jesus, is my plea
# Daily walking close to Thee.
Have you ever smelled death?
I don't recall smelling it.
Death smells like nothing you've
ever smelled in your life.
What does it smell like?
You know when
you've smelled death.
'Cause when you smell it...
you say to yourself,
"Damn.
Something die?"
Anything?
Does it say anything
about a child?
No.
Not specifically.
There was a small child,
roaming the garden.
- Oh, Flower, it said nothing
about children. - Wait.
Narrator fluctuates between
the first and third person.
Quite interesting.
I would have to say,
that he's above the age of a child.
Flower...
every town you go scurrying
off looking for offspring.
Wait.
Would you like a cup of tea?
One lump or two?
My name is Cup of Tea.
To my right, as you may already know,
is Flower Hercules.
To my left, Cod.
And behind us all,
but in front of you, Happy.
- And you are?
- Irwin.
Hello, Irwin.
- And your surname?
- Sir Irwin.
Well...
Sir Irwin of Northfork,
my family and I have
traveled a long way,
and we are having trouble
finding a loved one.
Are you familiar
with the unknown angel?
- Yes.
- Now...
this is where we can be
of help to each other.
What could we offer you?
When you leave,
just take me with you.
No.
Never.
We do not
take children.
- Then I can't help you.
- Now, Sir Irwin...
you're being unreasonable.
Where we're going,
we can't take you with us.
Then take me
a thousand miles.
A thousand miles,
in anybody's book is a long way.
How about a hundred miles?
- A thousand.
- 200.
- A thousand.
- 300.
- A thousand.
- 400, and that's it.
A thousand, and that's it.
Do you know how far that is?
A thousand miles, is a far...
far, faraway place.
- 500 miles.
- A thousand.
All right.
We'll take you a thousand miles,
if you bring us the unknown angel.
In the morning?
Deal?
# You the pain livin',
# of a heart full of shame
# You broke the law...
Ursula.
# Of God and man
- You have two customers.
# You stole from me the one,
# whose ring was on my hand
# I'd say that you...
# But through that came livin',
# with a heart full of shame...
Oh, I tell you,
these sons of bitches are...
harder to yank than a...
tick on the touch-hole
of a chicken.
I hear ya.
Ursula...
Good morning.
You have six customers...
now seated.
Well, if it ain't
the bottom feeders.
Go ahead, Willis.
Eggs?
Bacon?
Mm-mm.
Sausage?
Mm-mm.
No meat?
Mm-mm.
Potatoes?
Mm-mm.
Soup.
Mm!
Uh-huh.
Chicken?
Mm-hmm.
Broth?
- Cup or bowl?
- Yeah!
Good work, boss.
- Nice work, Walter.
- Nice work, Walter.
Thank you, boys.
I'll have a bowl.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Same.
Okay.
Dent.
It's only dirt.
Afternoon, boys.
Good afternoon, Father.
Walter.
Your wife, Patricia...
Henry...
Irwin's still sick.
I'm sorry, Father.
Mm...
Well, you got anything that'll keep
his spirits up and his fever down?
If I was those parents,
I'd be ashamed.
Well, most parents
can't see their child ill.
So they throw him in a lake.
All depends, Henry,
on how you look at it.
Either you're halfway to heaven
or halfway to hell.
Here we go, Father.
It's an antibiotic.
Inject five CC's
of this into his arm.
- Okay.
- All right?
Bless you.
Have a safe journey.
- Thank you, Father.
- All right.
<i>We thank you in advance</i>
<i>and hope you have...
a pleasant journey.</i>
- Pop?
- Yeah, son?
You suppose he's got two
of everything in there?
I suppose we'll find out.
# Now, I don't care
# If I'm not the first...
- Damn it.
# That you picked...
- I know.
# Darlin', I'll never ask...
- Not one, but two Chevys.
# Yesterday's gone...
- I know.
#... from now on
# They heard of me...
- This is going to be difficult.
#... about the past
- Yep.
# Now I don't care if I'm...
Ever since we started
moving folks out...
we've never done well with people
that owned Chevrolets.
#... I'll be the last.
Matt...
...this country is being divided
into two types of people...
Chevy people...
...and Ford people, Matt.
Yep.
# Now, I don't care
# If I'm not the first
love you've known
# Just so I'll be the last
# Now, I don't care...
- Looks like he got some kind of hammer.
#... that you picked
# Darlin' I'll never ask...
- No, it looks more like a...
I think he was
holding a shotgun.
I think you're right.
Every town we come to,
you want a child.
Once again, selfish.
How observant.
The noble Englishman.
How I longed to be Earl Grey.
The wit that got us here.
It's a splendid acquisition.
Unknown architect.
Probably owner-builder.
- A true visionary, I might add.
- Jesus.
No, no, he was a carpenter.
We-we-we're searching
for the unknown.
The unknown doesn't just
come knocking on your door.
If it is unknown, how would you
know if it did come knocking?
Well, it won't be
in the shape of a child.
- I would have to agree.
- Happy.
Do you ever disagree?
I disagree with the
Englishman's use of starch.
What do the Scriptures say?
"Temperature, 105 degrees.
High.
Please look after him
when I leave. "
What do you suppose we do?
We're going to wing it.
It appears they've...
worn out their welcome.
Good afternoon, Mr. Stalling.
My name is Walter O'Brien.
This here's my son, Willis.
We're with the
evacuation committee.
It's been brought to the state's attention
that you are seeking some assistance.
I'm not going anywhere, son.
We're aware of that, sir, that's why the
state has asked us to come to your aid.
The state understands your
difficulty with moving on.
The state will not hurt,
destroy,
nor harm you
physically in any way.
It is our civil duty to assist
you in making this transition
as easy and pleasant
as possible.
Your agreement is this...
you will each be assigned
65 households to depart.
Having fulfilled
said obligation,
you will then each
receive 1.5 acres...
of prime, lakefront property.
Your lot size
will be increased...
by one fifth of an acre for
every additional household
that you assist in evacuating
beyond the initial 65.
Have I made myself clear?
I will take your vacant
stares as a yes.
I could live
with an acre and a half.
O...
Okay by me.
May we, sir?
So...
...the prodigal son returns.
Already packed.
A little ahead of yourself.
I've brought
what you're looking for.
You have?
Outside.
I don't see anything.
We still have a deal?
Yes, yes, yes.
We have a deal.
Yeah, we still have a deal.
Where is it?
Oh, my.
Hello.
We'd appreciate
it if you both...
would stop screwing around.
What do you want to do?
The Youngs are going
to have a moving sale.
Perfect.
Now, all I need is a pair of sinners
like yourselves to mount up there.
We appreciate very much your giving
us this time to discuss this matter.
- A pair of wives?
- At least they're not mounted.
You know, it appears to me
that you folks are preparing
- for a flood in Biblical proportions.
- You got that right, son.
A flood is going to wipe
through this place...
- cleansing the soil of all sin.
- Understandable.
When God tells us
to get a move on,
we're gone at the first holler
of a rooster.
We ain't needing the State to come in here
and tell us when to pick up and get going.
That's God's doing.
This is God's land...
and by God, we ain't movin'
until we get that sign from above.
Yes, sir, uh...
- we aren't telling you to pick
up and get going. - No, sir.
Look at us as your
life preservers.
You can use us if you want,
or not at all.
- We give you that choice.
- We're all in the same boat.
So, sir, if you
don't mind, sir,
I'd like to bend you and
your wives' ear a bit,
and tell you
about the signs of God,
that we are familiar with.
This could be that sign.
A what?
- He said he was a relative.
- To us?
Yes.
- You're the unknown angel?
- Yes.
The one you're looking for.
Optimistic.
He is unknown.
- The angel part's questionable.
- Very.
How romantic.
There's a novel about you, too.
I started to collect these.
This is the first one I grew.
Now I'm not saying that this
boat you have built isn't worthy.
From the looks of it,
you've done a mighty fine job.
But for the sake of my job,
let's just say...
it doesn't.
Doesn't what?
- Your boat doesn't float.
- Imagine this, if you will.
One day, a town on the plains,
let's say Northfork,
was hit by a catastrophic flood...
similar to the days of Noah,
and you husband and yourselves
are standing out there on
the roof waiting to be rescued.
A friendly neighbor comes
paddling by in his little wooden boat,
and he yells, "Hey, there,
Mr. and Mrs. Stalling,
"and... uh, Mrs. Stalling,
jump on in,
and I'll take you to dry land. "
What do you say?
I don't know.
The water's rising.
You shout back, "No, thank you,
thy friendly neighbor.
I'm waiting
for a sign from God. "
No, thank you.
- I'm waiting for a sign from God.
- Yes, exactly.
And your friendly neighbor...
paddles away.
A few days later...
a state rescue team comes by...
in a larger boat.
And let's just say...
me and Willis are on board.
And we offer you the same deal.
"Jump on in,
"and you, Mrs. Stalling
and... Mrs. Stalling,
will be saved. "
And you say...
No, thank you.
We're waiting
for a sign from God.
A few more days pass,
and the water level has risen.
It has risen above the roof.
And unfortunately...
you and Mr. Stalling
have drowned...
and now are in heaven,
in front of God.
Dear, we died.
What about our belongings?
- We died?
- Oh, yes, you three have died
because you waited
for a sign from God,
and it never came,
and you three died.
But why?
That's the exact question
you would ask God.
You would say, "We waited for the sign...
and it never came. "
And you, and she...
and Mr. Stalling... died.
Now what do you suppose...
God...
is going to say to you both?
I don't know.
Mr. Stalling?
I'm dead, remember?
- May I?
- Yes.
I'll tell you
what God will say.
- "I sent you two boats...
- "Two boats.
...to save your lives. "
What more of a sign
did you three want?
May I?
Fascinating.
You have a lovely
collection of feathers.
Thank you.
And your halo.
Where's that?
They took it off when I was little.
I didn't need it anymore.
And these must
be your wings.
Oh, mighty.
Look at this.
And where did we get this?
These are quite stunning.
- The grace of God.
- Yes, they are.
We're offering you
a pair of something
that only the man upstairs
is willing to give you.
Where'd you get these boys?
Born and raised,
right here in Northfork.
Dear, what
are you thinking?
I'm thinking,
what bird suffered this?
Oh, there's nothing
fowl about these wings.
I understand
your initial doubt,
but how many times
have you seen wings,
of this size and beauty?
This is what most of
us were shot with.
Tranquillity at its finest.
This could make
an elephant fly.
It stuck in me, right here.
May I look?
Appears to be lengthy
needle of some sort.
Five years, maybe
six years of age.
Used numerous
times for injection.
You were shot with
this rifle?
Yes.
I was running with my flock
and they shot me.
- You were running with
your flock? - Yes.
Flock of what?
Doves? Geese? Seagulls?
Angels.
Angel wings, huh?
I'm here to tell you
these wings is worthless.
And to remove all doubt, we included
this certificate of authenticity.
Signed, sealed and blessed,
by your own Father Harlan.
"Found near the glaciers,
these wings, blah, blah, blah. "
From what they could tell, this particular
pair were detached from a juvenile,
who probably strayed
from the flock.
"Perhaps no wiser
than four years of age.
"The abbreviated
wingspan reveals to us...
"that he weighed no more
than 25 to 30 pounds,
"before they were removed. "
A bit too disturbing for me.
Happy...
are you looking at this?
Would you say amputated?
Yes.
Amputated.
Fascinating.
Angel.
Huh.
Aren't we all?
I'd say quite the opposite.
Probably a little devil,
and daddy gave him
a good strapping.
There's a back
story for you.
Does this cause any pain?
No.
This would be recognized
as a highly dangerous
procedure without anesthesia.
Some people would just,
bite a bullet.
A highly skilled surgeon...
was overly concerned
with muscle stabilization.
There's no evidence of
curvature of the spine.
You're discovering...
- feathers in this area?
- Yes.
- What time of day?
- Morning.
Can you run your fingers
through his hair?
What can you tell us
about your relatives?
My mother and father were
12th generation angels.
My great grandpa and
grandma had wings the size
of bombers and would
glide the plains of Northfork.
Come on, you ladies,
can't you just smell the bird shit?
I mean, I'd like to believe these
wings is authentic, but, the feathers,
they ain't attached
to anything.
You take those moose
antlers back there.
- Oh, dear.
- Yeah...
it's a fine set of antlers,
but it's more than just a rack of
horns attached to a piece of board.
That wouldn't be enough.
It's an okay place to
hang your hat, but...
there ain't no pride in it.
What you need is the whole
head hanging up there.
And these marble eyes just
a staring on down at you.
Then you know you've got
something really worth having.
We're still not leaving.
I've got a thousand-dollar
check from the state,
or would you rather use that
for your funeral services?
- No. - Then you best get the
hell out of here, right now.
Use these to fly
the hell out of here.
Wow.
Eddie.
Hey, Eddie.
I think Jigger's asleep.
Let's go.
Jesus Christ.
The scars on his forehead
tell me he did have a halo.
Most likely metal.
To stabilize his...
Oh.
Everything all right?
Dankish, beetle-headed
foot-licker.
What is wrong with you?
Happy?
You should be asking
yourself that question.
Fired from a long barrel rifle.
Ten feet away.
Needle meant to penetrate
two to three inches of skin.
Perhaps the hide
of a herbivore.
Beast of a hallucinogenic.
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- This isn't tea time.
Given my weight,
calculated dosage...
This could be a lengthy trip.
Moist.
Mother...
may I?
- No.
- Yes.
Plenty more
where that came from.
Here.
Shoot me, shoot Cod.
And then shoot
yourself in the foot.
No!
You saucy, sheep-biting,
flat-mouthed dewberry.
This could be a family...
Oh.
Santa's everywhere.
I'm happy.
This should back off
some evil spirits.
Hmm?
Oh.
Hmm.
- Two out of three ain't that bad.
- Damn it.
I say we hook that thing up to our
bumper and drag it out ourselves.
- What are you talking about, Willis?
- You know why? I'll tell you why.
- That there was number 65.
- I know that, Willis.
- I'm marking them down
as departed. - We can't.
The state makes their
final pass-through,
and they find that Mr. Stalling
locked up in that boat with his...
...moosehead.
It's our butt.
It's our job to move
them out of Northfork.
- It's not our job to know
where they go. - Willis...
It's our job to move people,
- not change their beliefs.
- What more,
could we have said?
Without the proper words,
this is just a man,
nailed to two
pieces of wood.
Oh, he's cute.
Father?
Yes, son.
- I don't think they want me.
- Oh, no, they do.
They do, son.
They came a long way for you.
Then, can I go with them?
I will still have to speak
with them.
Then, can you tell
them I'm an angel?
I will.
I will.
Because I want them
to see my wings.
Do you have wings?
Yeah? Me, too.
But mine got old and fell off.
You get some sleep now.
All right.
- Mr. and Mrs. Hope?
- Yes.
- I'm Father Harlan.
- Father.
Thank you for coming
on short notice.
Irwin is a good boy.
I could go on,
but that would seem
like I'm selling him to you.
And I'm not.
What?
You're not...
Well, given the chance,
I'm sure Irwin
would do a better job
at selling himself...
- Oh.
- ... than me.
Can we meet him?
Unfortunately...
you will have to
make a decision,
before you can meet him.
But, Father, it says right here that
we can spend the afternoon with him.
Yes, I know. I...
I'm sorry. I apologize.
But Irwin is a fragile boy.
I can't let him get his hopes up too
high only to have them diminished.
His health can't afford that
kind of a disappointment.
Oh, Father, we can't
make a decision
based upon viewing
him from a window.
I'm sorry.
Why don't you go
wait in the car?
Father, we come here
attempting to adopt a child,
and you turn it
into window shopping.
He's not a puppy.
Oh.
Well, maybe that's what you and
your wife should be considering.
I'm sorry if I have
wasted your time.
Have a pleasant journey.
<i>Many townspeople

Somebody is laying there.
You feel a heartbeat?
No.
You can figure...
a death of a person is
still considered progress.
Son of a bitch is getting the biggest
headstone this side of Rushmore.
Yeah.
Congratulations.
65 residents departed.
Good job.
You sign on that
bottom line,
1.5 acres will be transferred
into your name.
Hmm.
Well, your log reads
64 residents departed.
Is this correct?
- Well, sir...
- Yes, sir, it is.
Well, you know what?
I'd like to thank you personally for
your hard work and dedication
in the evacuation
of Northfork,
and hope to see you boys
out there enjoying the lake.
Wait a minute.
That's it?
We get nothing?
That's correct.
Sir, there...
There is another house that we
did not confirm their departure.
Well, then, you best go out
there and get it confirmed, huh?
Duck.
Duck.
Goose.
Boy was a tad pigeon-toed.
What do you think?
For most, Vincent Van Gogh
was a fine artist.
To some, he lacked technique.
Paint straight from the tube,
very heavy-handed.
How Van Gogh cut off his ear...
is what is most
intriguing to folks.
In each piece I've ever
appraised, the story
is always more fascinating
than the actual piece itself.
And?
It's a fantastic yarn the boy
has spun. Unfortunately...
the story is more valuable
than the actual piece.
What about his collection
of feathers?
Perhaps from the stork
that dropped him.
Feathers are inconsistent.
I couldn't find any connection
in the scriptures.
And that spleeny
ill-nurtured gnat.
Are you positive?
Oh, Flower, please,
be open to inconsistency.
What did the feathers
come in?
A book.
The book was in
a pillowcase.
I presume that the pillow
that the boy
lays his head on
is stuffed with feathers.
He is not
what we are here for.
La Fleur was touched
by an angel.
Is it snowing?
Can I go?
# You're not mine anymore
This is it, son.
Looks pretty vacant.
Indeed it does.
# If you don't ever
change your mind
Trick or treat.
Smells like something
died in here.
That is precisely why
we're not going to get mother.
Willis, you smell that?
Yeah, it smells
like something died.
Go upstairs and check all
the rooms. Then we'll leave.
What?
You're kidding.
You go upstairs and
check everything out.
Willis, go upstairs,
and see if anyone is up there.
I'm personally not ready
to face death.
This is number 65.
Go upstairs, check it out,
and let's get this over with.
I'm checking out
the other side.
Willis.
Willis!
Hello?
Hello there.
Pop.
Pop!
Do you see anything?
No.
Come on.
Jump.
It's about five feet, come on.
You can make it.
Jump.
Come on.
Pop, come on, jump!
You can make it.
Come on.
Are you okay?
Would you like a cup of tea?
I would qualify this in
the area of concussion.
A frothy, clay-brained snapper.
Let's help you get up
onto your feet.
Definitely going to feel
that in the morning.
Willis, let's go.
Did you see anyone?
Nope.
Come on!
Come on!
Get in the car!
Get!
What's got you
so spooked?
# If you don't ever
change your mind
# To take me back again
- Grab the book.
- Pop...
- Just do it!
Mark them down as evacs.
Evacuated.
- Do it!
- Okay, I will.
# Since the day you say
we're through
# I'm even more
in love with you
# And it's my fault that you're not mine...
- And I think we should go get your mom.
#... anymore
These have the same texture
as the feathers that were
in the boy's book.
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
No more than four
years of age.
Weighed no more
than 30 pounds.
These were attached
to something very young...
I'm going to have to
evaluate the other side.
Fascinating.
Oh, Lord...
Let the holy angels
come to Irwin.
And carry him to
your heavenly city.
Free his spirit...
from the prison of his body.
Fascinating.
No.
- No. Please, no.
- I'm sorry.
I'm a man of faith.
Forgiveness is my job.
But right now,
I can't forgive my faith.
Hmm.
Here.
He grew two inches
this summer.
Pop.
Still stacking wood?
Yep.
Pop?
Yeah?
You're not even close to
what death smells like.
I'm sorry.
I'm coming to get you.
I'm sorry.
I didn't forget you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Pop.
Come here.
What?
Can you see?
- What?
- Look closer.
No, I can't see anything.
What am I looking for?
There's a nick in my paint.
There's a nick in my paint!
Don't make it worse.
- Don't make it worse.
- It's only dirt. I was rubbing it off.
- What color is dirt?
- Brown?
If Marvin weren't blind,
he would see
that it was gray...
the color underneath my paint.
- Willis, the speck is brown.
- Look.
Brown after Marvin's
filthy hands rubbed it.
Well, I can't see
how you'd think
you could keep your car perfect
the way you drive anyway.
It hurts.
The first one... hurts.
You just never know
when it's going to come.
You know,
that's fate for you.
A little rock.
You do not have a say
in the matter.
Now that you've gotten
the first one...
...the rest comes easy.
You spend all your time...
polishing your car,
making everything perfect.
Then this rock...
flies out of nowhere,
and puts all your
hard work to shame.
Nothing you can do about it.
Absolutely nothing.
- Holy cow.
- Oh, my God.
...into the hole... take that...
...soft, so when you get
down in there,
you just thread this rope
through the top handle.
What?
You jump down
there and do it.
Willis.
No more. No, no, no, no.
This is downright wrong.
Once something's buried,
it should stay buried.
I can't show no
more respect.
You know,
when this small town
becomes the biggest lake
this side of the Mississippi,
your mother will be
the catch of the day!
Then throw some rocks on her.
That should keep her down.
Where you going to take her?
What about California?
What's there?
I heard in California they're
serving cheeseburgers and a soda
in less than two minutes flat.
Wow...
That's fast food.
I know you've been praying.
Not to worry.
A family will come soon.
You may be an orphan...
but you're still a child of God.
We must go get him, Flower.
If I didn't know your voice,
I would think it was my subconscious.
Could he be?
He is.
You don't want to believe him,
do you?
You do?
He's just a child.
I can't accept that.
Yes, I know.
We can't.
We have to.
You have to.
Don't let your motherly nature
cost you your manhood.
He prayed for us.
1.5 acres of
lakefront property.
Hmm.
Northern Pike?
Might be.
Pike's not a fish.
It's a dog.
Skull full of teeth.
Pick those suckers up
by their eye sockets.
Weapons of
massive destruction.
They drop that pike's
milt into this lake.
You can forget all about the fish
living in peace and harmony.
Pike eat their children.
What they should do is introduce
a nice game fish like the Muskie.
- Now, that's a fine species.
- Mm.
No fish from Minnesota should be
allowed to swim past the Missouri.
The fine citizens of
Northfork knew that
Muskie was swimming
through their houses,
we would've never been able
to get 'em to leave.
Canada ought to claim that
bug-heap they call Minnesota.
Throw in Wisconsin for free.
You have to think that this must
have been his last day on the job.
You ready?
1,000 miles?
Farther.
You're a relative.
Hercules...
the strongest man
ever to wear a skirt.
Are you going to be my mother
or my father?
I'm both.
Considered the perfect soul,
I search for no one,
and no one looks for me.
Whatever I need I look
within myself to find.
I am complete.
I am not king nor queen,
yet I am both.
A mother and a father.
You prayed to be this way?
Isn't that what
Father Harlan says?
"Pray and you shall receive?"
Would you like a cup of tea?
Irwin?
Well?
There you go, son.
<i>And in that journey of dying,</i>
<i>you see many things.</i>
<i>But all issues
I had passed.</i>
<i>Because I was
to be a witness.</i>
<i>A helper.</i>
<i>And that's the thing,
I think,</i>
<i>is important about death,</i>
<i>is the ability for us
to be witnesses.</i>
<i>Not only for our births
of coming in,</i>
<i>but going out.</i>
<i>And that's what
we have here.</i>
<i>We've lost our town.
It's gone.</i>
<i>But maybe there's
a birth someplace else.</i>
<i>Maybe there's a blessing,</i>
<i>from that experience.</i>
<i>I'm no longer
afraid of death,</i>

taken me 60 years to learn.</i>

<i>As you stroll
around Northfork,</i>

down the dirt road</i>
<i>that leads to where
your house may have been,</i>
<i>and look at the trees
that you once climbed.</i>
<i>Smile, and remember those trees
for what they will become:</i>
<i>Future snags
for fishing tackle.</i>
<i>As you continue your walk,
think to yourself,</i>
<i>"This is the only time
I will ever be able</i>
<i>"to walk on the
bottom of a lake</i>

to hold my breath. "</i>

<i>No one else will
pack them for you.</i>
