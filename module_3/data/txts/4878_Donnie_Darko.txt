I'm voting for Dukakis.
Well...
Maybe when you have children
of your own, who need braces...
and you can't afford them because half
of your husband's paycheck
goes to the federal government, you'll...
regret that.
My husband's paycheck?
Anyway, I'm not gonna squeeze
one out till I'm like 30.
Will you still be working
at the Yarn Barn?
Because I hear that's a really
great place to raise children.
That's really funny.
No, I think a year
of partying's enough.
-She'll be going to Harvard next fall.
-Mom, I haven't even gotten in yet.
Do you honestly think Michael Dukakis
will provide for this country
... till you're ready to squeeze one out?
-Yeah, I do.
-When can I squeeze one out?
-Not until 8th grade.
Excuse me.
Donnie, you're such a dick.
Whoa, Elizabeth!
A little hostile there.
Maybe you should be
the one in therapy,
then Mom and Dad can pay
someone 200 dollars
an hour to listen
to all your thoughts...
so we don't have to.
Okay. You wanna tell Mom and Dad why
you stopped taking your medication?
-You're such a fuck-ass!
-What?!
-Please.
-Did you just call me a fuck-ass?
Elizabeth, that's enough.
You can go suck a fuck!
Oh, please, tell me Elizabeth,
how exactly does one suck a fuck?
-You want me to tell you?
-Please, tell me.
We will not have this
at the dinner table.
-Stop.
-Fuck...
What's a fuck-ass?
Some part of the reason that I took
a year off was to be with you.
-What?
-How did you know?
-I didn't know it was such a big deal.
-It is a big deal.
I'm reading. Get out of my room.
Where do you go at night?
-Will you just get out of my room?
-Did you toilet-paper the Johnsons' house?
-Is that what you came here to ask me?
-No.
I stopped rolling houses
in the sixth grade, Mom.
What happened to my son? I don't
recognize this person today.
Then why don't you start
taking the goddamn pills.
Bitch.
Our son just called me a bitch.
You're not a bitch.
You're bitchin',
but you're not a bitch.
<i>I want to be a president
of the United States to make sure</i>
<i>that we never again do business
with a drug-running Panamanian dictator</i>
<i>that we never again
funnel aid to the Contras</i>
<i>through convicted drug dealers.</i>
<i>Values begin at the top.</i>
Dukakis...
Son of a bitch.
<i>Those are the values I want to bring
to the presidency and to the White House,</i>
<i>beginning in January of 1989.</i>
<i>-Panama is a friendly country.</i>
-Tell him, George.
<i>I went down there and talked
to the president of Panama</i>
<i>about their cleaning
up their money laundering.</i>
<i>And Mr. Noriega was there, but there
was no evidence at that time.</i>
<i>And when the evidence
was there, we indicted him.</i>
<i>Wake up.</i>
<i>I've been watching you.</i>
<i>Come closer.</i>
<i>Closer.</i>
<i>28 days... </i>
<i>Six hours... </i>
<i>42 minutes... </i>
<i>12 seconds.</i>
<i>That is when the world will end.</i>
Why?
Son? Donnie Darko?
Donnie Darko? What
the heck's going on here?
-Who is it, Don?
-It's Eddie Darko's kid.
I'm sorry about this, Jim.
He's just a neighbourhood kid.
Guess he was sleep-golfing?
Watch out for that drool spot!
Are you all right, son?
So... Let's stay
off the links at night, ok?
I'm... I'm sorry, Dr. Fisher.
It won't happen again.
-Kids...
-Let's golf.
-No one's allowed...
-This is my house.
-I said...
-This is my house!
Wait a minute.
-Here's your brother.
-It fell in your room.
Ms. Darko? I'm Bob Garland.
I'm with the FAA.
-The what?
-I'm with the FAA.
If you don't mind, we'd like to speak
to you and your husband privately.
-In private?
-Please.
And here...
All right, we have arranged
for you to stay at a hotel.
Get some sleep, and we will take
care of things here.
Great.
Thank you.
Kids, come on. We're
going to a hotel.
They don't know
where it came from.
If it fell from the plane...
then what happened to the plane?
They don't know, Samantha.
Is there any way we can
make money from this?
Can't we get on television
if we sue the airline?
Shut up, Sam.
Why do I have to sleep with Donnie?
He stinks.
When you fall asleep tonight,
-I'm gonna fart in your face.
-I'm telling Mom!
Samantha, don't go over there.
Frankie Feedler.
You remember. From high school.
He died.
Remember?
On his way to the prom.
They said he was doomed.
Jesus.
They could be saying
the same thing about Donnie.
Our Donnie.
But he dodged it.
He dodged his... photograph.
Somebody was watching over him.
Mrs. Farmer will bring you home
after practice. Donnie... Bye, honey.
Donnie, good luck.
-Oh, my God! Ok, tell me everything.
-I'm not allowed to talk about it.
-Oh, my God!
-Hi, Cherita.
-Shut up!
-Darko cheats death! Huh?
You're like a celebrity, man!
I've been calling you, like, a jillion
times. Where have you been?
-We stayed at a hotel.
-My dad said he saw you at the golf course.
-You sleepwalking again there, buddy?
-I don't want to talk about it.
And now that you're famous,
you gotta have a smoke.
What happens if you tell Mom
and Dad about this, Sam?
-You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
-Goddamn right, I will.
-So grody.
-Hey, Cherita, you want a cigarette?
-Shut up!
-"Chut up!"
Go back to China, bitch!
Just leave her alone.
-Some good shit, huh?
-It's a fucking cigarette.
"There would be headlines
in the papers.
Even the grown-up gangs who ran the betting
at the all-in wrestling and the barrow-boys
would hear with respect of how Old
Misery's house had been destroyed.
It was as though this
plan had been with him
all his life, pondered
through the seasons,
now, in his 15th year, crystallized
with the pain of puberty".
What is Graham Greene trying
to communicate with this passage?
Why did the children break
into Old Misery's house?
-Joanie?
-They wanted to rob him.
Joanie, if you had actually
read the short story,
which at a whopping 13 pages
would have kept you up all night,
you would know that the children find
a great deal of money in the mattress,
but they burn it.
Donnie Darko, perhaps with your recent
brush with mass destruction,
you can give us your opinion.
Well, they say it
right when they...
flood the house, and they tear
it to shreds, that, like...
destruction is a form
of creation,
so the fact that they burn
the money is ironic.
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.
They want to change things.
May we help you?
Yeah, I just registered, and they put
me in the wrong English class.
You look like you belong here.
Um... Where do I sit?
Sit next to the boy you
think is the cutest.
-Quiet!
-Oh, my God.
Let her choose.
Joanie, get up.
<i>What people don't understand
about this upcoming election</i>
<i>is that Michael Dukakis does not have
the financial infrastructure in place... </i>
Well...
The construction guys say it'll take
about a week to fix the roof.
Damned airline better not
fuck us on the shingle match.
-They still don't know?
-Know what?
-Where it came from?
-Oh, no.
Apparently they can't tell us
what happened yet. Something about...
Matching a serial
number that got burned.
I had to sign a form saying
I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
So we're not supposed to tell
anyone what nobody knows?
Yes. But you tell...
-What's your doctor's name?
-Dr. Thurman, Dad.
Yes. You tell Dr. Thurman
whatever you want.
-Dad.
-What?
Dad!
What's that woman doing standing
out in the middle of the damn road?!
No mail today. Maybe tomorrow.
Well, what did she say to you?
-I made a new friend.
-Real or imaginary?
-Imaginary.
-Would you like to talk about this friend?
-Frank.
-Frank.
-What did Frank say?
-He said to follow him.
-Follow him? Where?
-Into the future.
And then what happens?
And then he said...
Then he said that the world
was coming to an end.
Do you think the world
is coming to an end?
No.
That's stupid.
<i>For my entire life,
I was a victim of my own fear.</i>
<i>Love.</i>
<i>I was feeding fear with food.</i>
<i>Fear.</i>
<i>And finally, I looked
in the mirror.</i>
<i>Not just in the mirror.
I looked through the mirror.</i>
<i>In that image, I saw
my ego reflection.</i>
<i>For two years, I thought it was normal
for a 10-year-old to wet the bed.</i>
<i>We tried everything.</i>
<i>But the solution
was there all the time.</i>
<i>I'm not afraid anymore!</i>
<i>All over America, people have
come together to join hands.</i>
<i>People who believe that human
life is absolutely too important,</i>
<i>too valuable and too precious
to be controlled by fear.</i>
<i>Pay close attention. You
could miss something.</i>
<i>Hello. My name is Jim Cunningham.
And welcome to "Controlling Fear".</i>
"... and the prince was led into a world
of strange and beautiful magic".
Wow.
-Donnie!
-"The Last Unicorn" by Samantha Darko.
-Give it back!
-"There was once a unicorn named Ariel..."
Donnie...
-You wrinkled it.
-It's not wrinkled, Sam, just...
You know, flatten it
in a book or something.
It's almost 7:45. The bus
should've been here like 20 minutes ago.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went
nuts and hijacked the bus.
Hey, you know, there's like this
rule, at 7:45 we get to go home.
There's no rule.
Cherita, you should... go home.
Yeah. Yeah, if you're still
here when the bus comes,
we're all gonna
get in trouble.
-Shut up!
-"Chut up!"
Hey, Porky Pig, I hope
you get molested.
Oh my God. Can't believe this.
My mom said that school is closed
today because it's flooded.
-No way!
-Yeah.
Holy shit! That's the best
news I've ever heard!
My God, is this
ever going to stop?
Eventually, yes, it will. But right now
I got 12 classrooms full of water.
All coming from a busted
water main.
-What else?
-What else?
Principal Cole, I'll show
you what else.
That's unbelievable.
That's solid bronze, isn't it?
-Yep.
-How did this happen?
I heard a cat burglar broke
in and trashed everything.
And the Mongrel got
his head cut off.
True!
Beth's mom said the boys'
locker room was flooded,
and they found
feces everywhere.
-What are feces?
-Baby mice.
Hey.
Has anyone ever told
you that you're sexy?
I like your boobs.
Hey.
Hey.
School's canceled.
Do you wanna walk me home?
Sure.
-Don't look so freaked.
-I'm not. Just...
You should check your backpack.
These guys love to steal shit.
No. Fuck 'em!
-So, why'd you move here?
-My parents got a divorce.
My mom had to get a restraining
order against my stepdad.
He has emotional problems.
Oh, I have those too. What kind
of emotional problems does your dad have?
He stabbed my mom four
times in the chest.
Oh. Did he go to jail?
No, he fled. They
still can't find him.
But my mom and I had
to change our names, and...
I thought Gretchen
Ross was pretty cool.
I was in jail once. I mean...
I accidentally burned down this house.
It was abandoned,
but still, I...
You know, I got held back in school
and I can't drive till I'm 21, you know...
But I'm over all of that.
I'm... painting and stuff.
Writing. I want to be a writer. Maybe
painter. I don't know, maybe both...
I'll write a book
and draw the pictures.
Then maybe people will understand me.
I don't know, change things.
Donnie Darko, what the hell kind
of name is that? It's like...
some sort of superhero
or something.
What makes you think I'm not?
Look, I should go. For physics, Montinoff
is having me write this essay.
Greatest invention ever
to benefit mankind.
It's Monnitoff. But that's easy.
Antiseptics.
Like, the whole sanitation thing.
Joseph Lister, 1895.
Before antiseptics there was no
sanitation, especially in medicine.
You mean soap?
Well, I'm really glad
school was flooded today.
Why is that?
Because you and I never
would have had this conversation.
You're weird.
Sorry.
No, that was a compliment.
Well, look, uh...
You want to go with me?
Where do you want to go?
No, I mean, like, "go" with me.
Like, you know... Like...
That's what we call it here.
-"Going together".
-Sure.
Ok. Hey, where are you going?
I'm going home.
Stupid...
"Where are you going?".
I'd like to try something
new this time.
Have you ever been hypnotized?
No.
And when I clap my hands twice, you
will wake up. Do you understand?
-Yes.
-So, tell me about your week.
I met a girl.
What is her name?
Gretchen.
We're going together now.
Do you still think
about girls a lot?
Yeah.
-How are things going at school?
-I think about girls a lot.
I asked you
about school, Donnie.
I think about fucking
a lot during school.
What else do you think
about during school?
"Married With Children".
-You think about your family?
-I just turn down the volume
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.
I asked you
about your family, Donnie.
No.
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.
I'd like to hear
about your friend Frank.
Sam Bylan.
Cherita Chen.
Donald Darko.
Daye Dennis.
Hey, you fuck!
Did you tell 'em
that I flooded the school?
I didn't say shit.
Yeah, well, that's not what I heard.
They think I did it.
Yeah, well, if you're innocent, then you
have nothing to worry about, right?
Fuck you! You know what I think?
I think you did it.
Beer and pussy,
that's all I need.
-So we gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
-Smurfette?
Mm-hm. Not some, like, tight-ass
Middlesex chick, you know?
Like, this cute little blonde that'll get
down and dirty with the guys,
like Smurfette does.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
That's bullshit. Smurfette
fucks all the other Smurfs.
Why do you think
Papa Smurf made her?
Because all the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.
-Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
-Ok, well, you know what, then...
She fucks them
while Vanity watches. Ok?
What about Papa Smurf? I mean,
he must get in some of the action?
Yeah, what he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.
First of all, Papa Smurf didn't
create Smurfette. Gargamel did.
She was sent in as Gargamel's evil
spy, with the intention...
of destroying the Smurf village,
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurf way of life
transformed her.
And as for the whole
gang-bang scenario...
it just couldn't happen!
Smurfs are asexual.
They don't even have...
reproductive organs, under those
little white pants.
That's what's so illogical, you
know, about being a Smurf.
What's the point of living...
if you don't have a dick?
Damn it, Donnie, why do you
gotta get so smart on us?
Grandma Death.
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Please stay off the road,
Miss Sparrow.
If this happens again I am
going to call Social Services.
And I hate that Miss Farmer.
Such a fucking bitch!
Yeah.
-How old is Grandma Death?
-101.
She does the same
thing every day.
Just walks back and forth and back
and forth to the mailbox.
Nothing ever in there.
Oh, wait, wait, wait...
She goes... She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.
-Mail, mail, mail. Mail.
-Here it is.
This could be it.
-Oh, no dice, Grandma. No, sorry. Sorry.
-Someone ought to write that bitch.
<i>Authorities continued
their search today,</i>
<i>for a suspect in the Middlesex
Ridge School vandalism.</i>
<i>The private school has
asked for public donations</i>
<i>to help restore its
beloved mascot,</i>
<i>known only as the Mongrel.
In other news... </i>
It's very helpful. You wanted one? So
glad there's a good turnout tonight.
What are you trying
to accomplish here?
There was urine and feces
flooded in my office.
Whatever fits.
"Whatever fits"?
In cooperation
with the county police,
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.
And our suspects include several
of our own students. Now...
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.
Kitty, I would appreciate,
if you would wait...
Dr. Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I am
also a parent of a Middlesex child.
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>You got away with it.</i>
I have in my hand Graham
Greene's "The Destructors".
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.
How can you do that?
And how do they do this? They flood
the house by breaking through a water main.
<i>I can do anything that I want.</i>
<i>And so can you.</i>
And I think that this
garbage should be removed!
Excuse me.
What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.
The PTA is here to acknowledge
that pornography is being
taught in our curriculum!
-It's meant to be ironic.
-Excuse me.
You need to go back
to grad school.
Why did you make me
flood the school?
<i>They are in great danger.</i>
Kittie. Do you even know
who Graham Greene is?
I think we have
all seen "Bonanza".
Well, um...
While we are on other topics...
Where did you come from?
<i>Do you believe in time travel?</i>
Who are you talking to?
I was just taking my pills, Sam.
A storm is coming, Frank says.
A storm that will swallow
the children.
And I'll deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.
I'll deliver the children
back to their doorsteps,
I'll send the monsters
back to the underground.
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.
Except for me.
Because I am Donnie Darko.
Who is Frank?
A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
<i>In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.</i>
<i>I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.</i>
<i>It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.</i>
<i>It's time to breathe.</i>
<i>It is time to breathe.</i>
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>
<i>Thank you, Jim Cunningham.</i>
<i>So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.</i>
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.
Fear and love.
Fear is in the negative
energy spectrum.
And love is in the positive
energy spectrum.
-No, duh...
-Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.
Now...
On each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.
Please... Take this. Thank you.
Please read each character
dilemma aloud,
and place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.
Cherita?
"Juanita has an important
math test today.
She's known about the test for several
weeks, but has not studied.
In order to keep
from failing her class,
Juanita decides that she will cheat
on the math test".
Good. Good. Very good.
Mr. Darko.
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
on the ground filled with money.
She takes the wallet to the address
on the driver's licence
but keeps the money
inside the wallet".
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer.
I don't get this.
Just place an "X" on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.
No. I mean, I know what to do.
I just... I don't get this.
You can't just lump things
into two categories.
Things aren't that simple.
The lifeline
is divided that way.
Well, life isn't that simple.
I mean...
Who cares if Ling Ling returns
the wallet and keeps the money.
It has nothing to do
with either fear or love.
Fear and love are the deepest
of human emotions.
Ok. But you're not
listening to me.
There are other things to need to be
taken into account here, like,
the whole spectrum of human emotion.
You can't just...
lump everything into these two categories
and then just deny everything else!
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero for the day.
Donald, let me preface
this by saying
that your Iowa
Test scores are...
intimidating.
So...
Let's go over this again. What
exactly did you say to Miss Farmer?
I'll tell you what he said.
He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus!
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...
Kitty...
Excuse us, please.
They've suspended him from after-school
activities for next six months.
Ever since this jet engine fiasco,
I honestly don't know what's gotten into...
Rose, I'll tell you this
because our daughters have been
on the dance team together for two years,
and I respect you as a woman,
but after witnessing
your son's behaviour this afternoon,
I have significant
doubts about your...
Our paths through life
must be righteous.
I urge you to go home
and look in the mirror
and pray that your son doesn't
succumb to the path of fear.
Do you remember that weird
gym teacher, Mrs. Farmer?
Yeah. Ok, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.
And then my parents just
bought him all this new shit.
Yeah, I know. I wish a jet
engine would fall on my room.
-Dr. Monnitoff.
-Donnie.
I know this is gonna sound
kind of weird, but...
Do you know anything about...
time travel?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen
bridge, which is,
theoretically a wormhole
in space controlled by man.
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole
may be able to provide a shortcut
for jumping between two distant
regions of space-time.
So in order to travel back in time,
you have to have a big spaceship,
or something that can travel
faster than the speed of light.
Theoretically.
And be able to find
one of these wormholes.
The basic principles
of time travel are there.
You got your vessel
and your portal.
And your vessel could be just
about anything, most likely a spacecraft.
-Like a DeLorean?
-Metal craft of any kind.
You know, I love that movie. The
way they shot it. It's so...
Like, futuristic, you know?
Listen, um... Don't tell
anybody that I gave you this.
The woman who wrote this
used to teach here.
She was a nun, many years
before that, but...
And then overnight she just...
She became this entirely
different person.
She... up and left the church,
she wrote this book...
She started teaching science.
Right here at Middlesex.
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Roberta Sparrow?
That's right.
Come on...
Roberta Sparrow?
Roberta Sparrow.
Grandma Death.
It's called "The Philosophy
of Time Travel".
What does philosophy have to do
with do with time travel?
Guess who wrote it.
Who?
Roberta Sparrow. Huh!
She wrote a book.
Grandma Death wrote a book.
That's a terrible nickname.
We almost hit her
with the car the other day.
She lives up there in that piece of crap
house, and you know she's loaded. She's...
Yeah, you're right. She used to be
known for her gem collection.
Kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her.
She became a total recluse.
I didn't know she was alive till we damn
near knocked her down the other day.
<i>She was just standing there,
in the middle of the road, frozen.</i>
<i>So, I got out of the car and I walked
over to see if she was ok.</i>
And she leaned over,
and whispered in my ear.
-What did she say?
-I mean, I think Frank wants me to
go talk to her, you know,
because the last time I saw him...
He asked me if I knew
about time travel.
And she wrote a book about it, so
that can't be like a coincidence, right?
Donnie, what did Roberta
Sparrow say to you?
She said that every living
creature on earth dies alone.
How did that make you feel?
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
She died when I was eight and she crawled
underneath the...
the porch.
To die.
To be alone.
Do you feel alone right now?
I don't know...
I mean, I'd like to believe
I'm not, but I just...
I've just never seen
any proof, so I...
I just don't debate it anymore, you know.
It's like...
I could spend my whole life
debating it over and over again,
weighing the pros and cons, and in the end,
I still wouldn't have proof, so I just...
I just don't debate it anymore.
It's absurd.
The search for God is absurd?
It is if everyone dies alone.
Does that scare you?
I don't want to be alone.
And so his tapes
have made me realise
that for the last 39 years, I have
been a prisoner of my own fear.
Fear.
Rose, you have got to meet
this Jim Cunningham.
I can't believe he is single.
<i>And it has been a disappointing night
indeed for these Super Bowl champions.</i>
<i>You're right, Dan.</i>
<i>Coach Joe Gibbs is on the sidelines,
water dripping off his glasses,</i>
<i>but he's gotta be thinking, "What happened?
What went wrong tonight?"</i>
<i>And here's the kick.</i>
<i>It's no good... </i>
-Shit, we need a quarterback.
-We need a miracle.
-We need to go for a safety.
<i>-...  so what the future holds</i>
<i>for this Super Bowl MVP, we're
just gonna have to wait and see.</i>
You guys want anything?
<i>By the way, this week
on a special "Who's The Boss?",</i>
<i>starring Tony Danza
and Judith Light,</i>
<i>Samantha borrows Tony's van
and gets caught without a licence.</i>
<i>Well, we're gonna make sure
we don't miss that one, ah?</i>
<i>Here we are again.</i>
<i>Fourth down now... </i>
<i>Here's the kick... </i>
Ok, let's not forget tomorrow
we're meeting with our partners
for the Young Inventors' Fair.
What happened to your neck?
What?
The blood on your neck.
I don't want to talk about it.
So...
What are we gonna invent?
And what if you could
go back in time
and take all those hours
of pain and darkness
and replace them
with something better?
-Like images, or what?
-Yeah, like a Hawaiian sunset or...
or the Grand Canyon. Just
things that remind you
of how beautiful the world...
You know, we've been going
together for like two weeks.
Yeah?
Well, I... I...
You want to kiss me?
-I'm sorry, I...
-Donnie, wait. I just...
-Well, I like you a lot.
-I just want it to be...
at a time when... it...
When what?
When it reminds me just...
When it reminds you
how beautiful the world can be?
Yeah.
And right now there's some fat
guy over there, staring at us.
I don't think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus
is something that should
go without consequence.
I think we should
buy him a moped.
I think we should get a divorce.
-You're not gonna tell Mom, are you?
-Why would I Mom?
-Because you tell Mom everything.
-No, I don't.
Let me see it.
No, it's not finished. It's...
It's ok. It's cool.
That's scary.
You think?
Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.
We've... we both felt that it was time
for us to come and... and discuss...
What I think is going
on with your son.
Yes.
Well, he's...
Ah... you know about his past,
and he was suspended from school
for insulting his gym teacher.
I'm not really sure
that's a good example, Rose.
I think he had just
cause to insult her.
Rose, let me just lay
out what I believe is happening here.
Donnie's aggressive behaviour,
his increased detachment
from reality,
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world
that he perceives
to be threatening.
Has he ever told you
about his friend Frank?
Frank?
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.
The what?
I don't recall him ever
having mentioned a rabbit.
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly
called a daylight hallucination.
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.
What can we do?
I would like to, um...
do more hypnotherapy...
and increase his medication.
Whatever will help
him, really, is...
That's why we're here.
We just would like him
to experience some relief.
So if you think that more
medication will do that,
then I think we should
give it a try.
Well, what is it like?
It's complicated.
Yeah?
There's like a force, you know,
in your brain, that just
sends you someplace.
Do you go someplace familiar?
No, but I...
Actually, each time I keep waking
up farther and farther from my house.
Scary.
Donnie Darko.
I know.
-Good morning, you mongrels!
-Good morning.
Does that all the guster you can muster?
I said, good morning!
-Good morning!
-Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.
But I can still sense
some students out there
who are actually afraid
to say "good morning!"
Good morning!
Yeah,
that's what I like to hear!
Because entirely too
many young men and women today
are completely paralyzed
by their fears.
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction
of drugs, alcohol
and premarital sex.
Now, I'm gonna tell you
a little story today.
It's a heartbreakingly sad
story about a young man
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.
His name was Frank.
-We're moving through time.
-What?
Hi, um... My stepsister, like, I sometimes
worry that she eats too much.
-Shut up, Kim!
-I'm just trying to help you.
Oh, sweetheart,
sweetheart, please,
there's absolutely no reason
to be embarrassed here.
Many times we eat because we're afraid
to face our ego reflection. Alright?
We find ourselves looking at the mirror,
rather than into and through the mirror.
When we do that, we can finally see
the reality of how beautiful we are.
-Thanks!
-Sure. Come up here. Don't be afraid.
Ah... How can I find
out what I wanna be when I grow up?
Oh! That's a hard one. Well,
what I need you to do...
is look deep inside of yourself,
deep within your heart,
and find what it is in the world
that makes you feel love,
pure, unconditional
love, and go to that.
In your studies, in your athletics,
in your relationships, go towards love.
-Thank you.
-Come on up.
Ok.
Next.
What do I do to learn
how to fight?
"What do I do to learn
how to fight... "
Son, violence
is the product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself,
truly love yourself,
and the world will be yours.
-Ok.
-Get yourself up here!
All right!
-Good morning.
-Good morning!
How much are they paying
you to be here?
Ah... Excuse me?
What is your name, son?
Gerald.
Well, Gerald, I think
you're afraid.
Are you telling us this stuff
so we can buy your book?
Because I gotta tell
you, if you are,
that was some of the worst
advice I ever heard.
-Do you see how sad this is?
-You want your sister to lose weight?
Tell her to get off the couch,
stop eating Twinkies,
and maybe go
out for field hockey.
You know what, no one ever knows
what they want to be when they grow up.
You know, it takes a little while to find
that out. Right, Jim?
And you...
Yeah, you.
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet? Well, you know what?
Maybe, you should lift some weights, or...
take a karate lesson,
and the next time he tries to do
it, you kick him in the balls.
Son... Do you see this?
This is an anger prisoner,
a textbook example.
-An anger prisoner...
-Do you see the fear, people?
This boy is scared to death of the truth.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,
but I believe you are a very
troubled and confused young man.
I believe you are searching
for the answers in all the wrong places.
You're right, actually.
I am pretty...
I'm pretty troubled and I'm
pretty confused. But I...
And I'm afraid, really, really afraid.
Really afraid, but I... I...
I think you're
the fucking Antichrist.
This is amazing, you know. The man
thinks he's telling the truth.
And everything he says
is just a fucking lie.
Everything he says!
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...
Everything he does...
They're just gonna...
Are you ok?
Yeah...
Sit down. Calm down.
You ever hear of Grandma Death?
Who?
"The Philosophy of Time Travel".
What is this?
She wrote it.
I'm...
I've been seeing stuff...
Like a lot of really
messed-up stuff.
And there's... There're
chapters in that book
that describe the stuff
I've been seeing,
and it can't just
be a coincidence.
She gotta be in here, somewhere.
She never leaves this house.
Well, maybe she's asleep.
Donnie, look.
<i>Send her a letter.</i>
<i>Well, each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time,</i>
<i>along its center of gravity.</i>
Like a spear.
-I beg your pardon?
-Like a spear that comes out of your chest.
Sure. Yeah.
And in order for the vessel
to travel through time,
it's got to find a portal,
or in this case a wormhole, or...
Well, could these portals...
Could these portals just appear...
anywhere, any time?
I think that's highly unlikely.
No, I think what you're
talking about is...
an act of God.
Well, if God controls time
then all time is pre-decided.
I'm not following you.
Every living thing follows
along a set path.
And, if you could see your path or channel,
then you could see into the future, right?
Like... That's a form
of time travel.
Well, you're contradicting
yourself, Donnie.
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,
then we would be given a choice
to betray our chosen destinies.
And the mere fact that this choice exists
would make all preformed destiny...
-...  come to an end.
-Not if you travel within God's channel.
I'm... not going to be able
to continue this conversation.
-Why?
-I could lose my job.
Ok.
It gives me no pleasure to deny
you of the right to read
one of the great writers
of the 20th century, but...
Alas, I have not yet been elected queen
of the universe, so I must obey the rules,
and so will you.
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book will be suspended.
But not to worry.
Someone has already pre-ordered a dozen
copies at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.
In Mr. Greene's absence, we will now
be reading another classic,
"Watership Down"
by Richard Adams.
Here, Donnie.
Pass these back.
Maybe you and Frank can
read this one together.
<i>Now you know where he lives.</i>
And they grow out of our...
chest, solar plexus?
Just like she described in the book,
the way they moved and they smelled.
It's like...
like they're workers.
Assigned to each one of us. They just...
They're like liquid.
I followed it. Into
my parents' bedroom.
What did you find?
Nothing.
So we call them IMGs.
Infant Memory Generators.
Yeah. So, the idea is that you buy
these glasses for your infant,
and they wear them
at night when they sleep.
But inside the glasses are these slide
photographs, and each photograph is of...
something peaceful or beautiful,
whatever the parents want to put inside.
And what effect do you think
that this would have on an infant?
Well... this thing is, nobody
remembers their infancy.
And anyone who says
they do is lying, so...
We think this will help develop
memory earlier in life.
Yeah.
And did you stop and think
that maybe infants need darkness?
That maybe darkness is part
of their natural development?
No.
Yeah.
What if the parents, like, put in pictures
of Satan or dead people, crap like that?
Is that what you'd show
your kids?
Well, I mean, didn't your dad,
like, stab your mom?
Get out.
Gretchen!
Gretchen! Gretchen. I'm
sorry about those guys...
-Two for "Evil Dead", please.
-That'll be two dollars.
Why do you wear
that stupid bunny suit?
<i>Why are you wearing
that stupid man suit?</i>
Take it off.
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
It is the name of my father.
And his father before me.
Frank...
When is this gonna stop?
You should already know that.
I want you to watch
the movie screen.
There's something
I want to show you.
Have you ever seen a portal?
Burn it to the ground.
Ok. Now, girls, I want
you to concentrate.
Failure is not an option.
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there... just swallow it.
Ok, Mom.
Hey guys, good luck out there.
Now, that was really something.
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".
And now the moment
we've all been waiting for is here.
It is my very distinct pleasure
to introduce to you...
Emily Bates, Suzy Bailey, Samantha
Darko, Beth Farmer and Joanie James.
They are Sparkle Motion.
How long was I asleep for?
Whole movie.
Well, look what the cat
dragged in!
How you doing, Donnie?
Your little sister was broken-hearted
that you missed her big show last night.
Dad?
I'm crazy.
You're not crazy.
I used to be crazy.
But you're not crazy.
-Look, you're my only son...
-I know...
No, now hold it. I know I'm not
the best communicator, but...
Whatever happens to you,
be honest, tell the truth,
even if they do look
at you funny, they will.
But what you gotta
understand, son,
is that almost all of those
people are full of shit.
They're all part of this
great big conspiracy...
of bullshit.
And they're scared
of people like you.
Because those bullshitters know
that you're smarter than all of them.
You know what you say
to people like that?
"Fuck you".
<i>The blaze was extinguished sometime
after 8 o'clock last night.</i>
<i>Now firefighters discovered what has
been referred to as a kiddie porn dungeon.</i>
<i>Cunningham, who has
become a recent celebrity</i>
<i>for his books
and motivational tapes,</i>
<i>-... was arrested earlier this morning,</i>
-Oh, my God!
<i>while golfing at the Sarasota
Heights Country Club.</i>
<i>Arson has not been ruled out as part
of the cause of the fire.</i>
-Oh, my God.
<i>Now a group of Cunning
Vision employees... </i>
-Dad played golf with that guy.
-...  lead by self-proclaimed fear survivor...
<i>Linda Connie, vehemently
denied of the alleged link to</i>
<i>a child pornography
publishing circuit.</i>
<i>In a vicious statement, Connie attacked
the Middlesex fire department officials,</i>
<i>claiming a vast conspiracy.</i>
I'm sorry, Karen. This
is a progressive school,
but we don't feel the methods
you've undertaken here are appropriate.
What exactly about my methods
are inappropriate?
I am sorry that you have failed.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.
You can finish out the week.
Fuck!
Good afternoon. It gives me
great pleasure to announce
that the Middlesex Ridge
School dance team
has been invited to perform on Ed
McMahon's "Star Search '88"
 in Los
Angeles, California.
<i>-I know now, a terrible thing is coming.
-What do you mean?</i>
<i>The field, the field.
It's covered with blood.</i>
<i>Blood? Don't be silly.</i>
<i>All right, all right, Fiver.</i>
<i>It's getting dark. I think
we should get back to the burrow.</i>
<i>Back to the burrow? It'll come
there, don't think it won't.</i>
<i>-It's all around us!
-Now, stop it, Fiver.</i>
<i>We've got to go away from here.</i>
When the other rabbits hear
of Fiver's vision, do they believe him?
Why should we care?
Because the rabbits
are us, Donnie.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit
like it was human?
Are you saying that the death
of one species is less tragic than another?
Of course.
A rabbit's not like us.
You know, it has no history
books, no photographs,
no knowledge
of sorrow or regret.
I mean... I'm sorry, Ms. Pomeroy.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
you know, I like rabbits and all,
they're cute and they're horny.
And if you're cute and you're
horny then you're probably happy
that you don't know who you
are or why you're even alive.
You just want to have sex as many times
as possible before you die.
But I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...
you know, who... never even feared
death to begin with.
You're wrong.
These rabbits can talk, they're the product
of the author's imagination, and...
He cares for them, so we care for them,
otherwise we've just missed the point.
But aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?
The dea ex machina?
The god machine?
That's what saved the rabbits.
No, it was ridiculous.
I'll call you back.
-Rose.
-Kitty.
Rose, I'm sure that you're
aware of the horrible
allegations against Jim
Cunningham.
I know, I saw it on TV. Something
about a kiddie porn dungeon...
Oh, please, please!
Don't use those words!
It's obviously some kind of conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.
And I have taken it
upon myself to spearhead
the Jim Cunningham
defence campaign.
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.
And as you know, the girls are scheduled
to leave for Los Angeles in the morning.
Now, as their coach,
I was the obvious choice
to chaperone them
on their trip, but...
-But now you can't go.
-Yes.
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I would never dream of asking you.
But none of the other mothers
are available to go.
I don't know, Kitty. It's a bad weekend.
Eddie's in New York.
Rose, I don't know
if you realize
what an opportunity this
is for our daughters!
This has been a dream
of Samantha's
 and all of ours
for a long time.
I made her lead dancer!
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!
Elizabeth will be in charge.
She'll drive you to therapy.
And if you need anything, you promise
me that you will call Dr. Thurman?
How does it feel to have
a wacko for a son?
It feels wonderful.
Here... I'm Sorry! Here you are!
-You guys are gonna win. I know it.
-So do I.
Here's the keys to the Taurus.
There's ton of food in the fridge
and I left money on the kitchen
table, but please do not put...
Hey. Mom, go. You're
gonna miss your plane.
Mom, I need... I'm just...
There's nothing
broken in my brain.
-I know.
-Bye, Donnie.
Ok, go. Go!
Hello, Donnie.
It's Friday. Shouldn't you be
off with your friends, scaring old people?
What's going on?
I don't know.
That's a good question.
Suffice to say I'm no longer
your English teacher. They fired me.
That's bullshit!
You're the only good
teacher here.
Thank you.
What's "Cellar Door"?
This famous linguist
once said that
of all the phrases in the English
language, of all the endless combinations
of words
in all of history, that...
"Cellar Door"
is the most beautiful.
"Cellar Door".
I promise that one day
everything's gonna be better for you.
Shut up!
<i>-I want to talk about your past today.
-No.</i>
<i>I want to talk about you
and your parents.</i>
<i>They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.</i>
What did you want
for Christmas that year?
Hungry Hungry Hippos.
How did you feel, being denied
these Hungry Hungry Hippos?
Regret.
What else makes you feel regret?
That I did it again.
You did it again?
I flooded my school and I burned
down that pervert's house.
I only have a few days
left before they catch me.
-Did Frank tell you to do these things?
-I have to obey him. He saved my life.
I have to obey him or I'll be
left all alone. And then...
And then I won't be able to figure
out what this is all about.
I won't be able to...
know his master plan.
Do you mean God's master plan?
Do you now believe in God?
I have the power
to build a time machine.
How is that possible?
How is time travel
possible, Donnie?
Time's up, Frank said.
-When is this going to happen?
-Soon.
What is going to happen?
-Frank is gonna kill.
-Who is he going to kill?
Who is he going to kill, Donnie?
I can see him right now!
The sky's gonna open up.
If the sky were
to suddenly open up,
there would be no law,
there would be no rule.
There would only be you
and your memories.
The choices you've made
and the people you've touched.
If this world were to end, there
would only be you and him...
and no one else.
You can stop taking
your medication.
They're placebos. Just
pills made out of water.
Thank you.
Donnie...
An atheist is someone who denies
altogether the existence of God.
You're an agnostic.
An agnostic is someone...
who believes that there can be no
proof of the existence of God,
but does not deny a possibility
that God exists.
Goodbye, Dr. Thurman.
Hey.
I got in.
I'm going to Harvard.
Hey, we should totally throw a party.
I mean, Mom and Dad are gone, and...
It's Halloween Carnival. We
could totally get away with it.
Ok. But it has to be
small, alright?
We got eggs, water balloons
and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
I stole four beers from my dad.
-Well, we got a keg.
-Keg beer is for pussies.
<i>Rose, this is Lilian Thurman.</i>
It is extremely important that you call me
as soon as you get this message. Thank you.
Hey.
You ok?
Yeah. My mom's gone.
You want to come in?
I don't know. She...
She didn't leave a note and...
the house was all messed up.
But you're ok.
Did you call the cops?
Yeah, they said I should leave the house
and that I should go to a safe place.
I'm just so scared. I keep thinking
something awful was happening and...
It's my fucking
stepdad, I know it.
I guess some people are just...
born with tragedy
in their blood.
Hey, have you guys seen Frank?
No, I think they said they were
going on a beer run.
<i>If you're there, please pick up.</i>
<i>Oh, well. Good news.</i>
<i>The girls, they got
three and a half stars</i>
<i>and they get to come back
for the quarter-finals.</i>
<i>Samantha was amazing. Anyway... </i>
We're gonna take the red-eye back
tonight and we are to arrive...
-Mom, the plane's about to leave.
-Yeah. Ok.
We'll take the red-eye back
tonight we should arrive
around 8:30 in the morning.
I hope everything's... I hope
everything's all right.
I love you. Bye.
-Come with me.
-Where are we going?
-Donnie?
-Look, we gotta go.
-We've got to see Grandma Death.
-But why? Is this about the book?
-No, it's Frank.
-Donnie...
Time is running out!
We gotta go.
Donnie, nobody's here.
Let's just forget about it.
"Cellar door".
What?
Donnie! Donnie!
Donnie!
Why the fuck are you here?
Hey! Oh, my God.
-You're dead!
-What do we do?
-Oh, shit.
-Leave them alone!
Don't fucking move! Don't fucking move!
What did I say?
There's a car!
-Get the hell out of here, now!
-Come on!
Seth, there's a car's coming.
Let's go!
I have a bigger knife now.
Fuck!
Did you call the fucking cops?
-Dea ex machina.
-What did you just say?
-What the fuck did you just say?
-Our savior.
Donnie!
Frank...
Is she dead?
What were you guys doing
in the middle of the road, huh?!
What were you thinking?
Go home!
Go home and tell your parents
that everything's gonna be ok.
Go!
A storm is coming.
You must hurry.
Going home.
<i>Dear Roberta Sparrow, I've reached
the end of your book, and... </i>
<i>there's so many things
that I need to ask you.</i>
<i>Sometimes I'm afraid
of what you might telling me.</i>
<i>Sometimes I'm afraid that... you'll tell
me that this is not a work of fiction.</i>
<i>I can only hope that the answers
will come to me in my sleep.</i>
<i>I hope that when the world
comes to an end,</i>
<i>I can breathe a sigh of relief</i>
<i>because there will be so
much to look forward to.</i>
Hey. What's going on?
Horrible accident.
My neighbour...
he got killed.
-What happened?
-Got smooshed by a jet engine.
What was his name?
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
I feel bad for his family.
Yeah.
Did you know him?
No.
