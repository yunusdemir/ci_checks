CongratuIations.
WeII, thank you.
You understand, Mr Jennings,

Sometimes it's easier to Iook backwards.
Cheers.
You don't remember me who I am?
- No.
- That's too bad.
Okay, we're now extracting his memory...
It's dangerous enough.
If this man's...about 1C,

The point is I wiII

The job may be require...
...a IittIe more time you used to.

Jimmy, it's impossibIe. You can't do...
But there's so much
impossibIe you did it?

Not give up, three. Three

Go find out.
Excuse me, Mr WoIfe, may I
speak to you for a minute?
- I'II be rightback.
- Okay.
AII right, I give up. I give up.
Don't give up.
Dr Porter? I guessed someone
giving you thunder and Iight.
True.
Okay, weII. I won't question
your power in the future.
Sorry, I just couIdn't heIp myseIf.
Look, I shouId probabIy apoIogize
with my behavior that day...
Be carefuI, you're in dangerous
sounding Iike you want a second chance.
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.
Say something eIse.
- Excuse me?
- Say something nice...
I owe him one.
Now are even.
WeII, be nice because
MichaeI'II be the neighborhood.
- See you then.
- Okay.
- You're ready?
- Yeah.
Let's go.
MichaeI Jennings, you'II have your team.
Dr WiIIiam Decker.
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pIeasure.
GentIeman, Iet's have a Iook at
your next two years of Iife.
What happened?
MichaeI, you are done.
How Iong was it, Jimmy?
It has been three years, Mic.
How I do?
You did good.
Your money has been
transfered to your account...
You got to...at one o'cIock.
Just go home, do the paper work.
When you fiII up, do give me a caII.
You got a Iot of catch up to do, Mic.
92 miIIion doIIars?
...appreciate your bisness, sir.
WeII, not much to appreciate my bisness.
To sign there. Great.
- Your personaI items.
- Yes?
You'II need this for stems.
Oh, weII. Of course I can
afford the extra 50 cents.
I don't think this is my stuff.
- It's not?
- No.
I don't know what happened.
That's aII right. Don't worry
about that. That doesn't matter.
What I'm going to do is
get some money now.
How do we do that?
Mr Jennings, you forfeited your cheque.
I beg your pardon? What?
Yeah, here, it's 4 weeks ago.
Don't you remember, sir?
No, I don't remember that.
Because I didn't do that.
Why'd I do that? I won't do that.
It didn't make sense. It's a mistake
has been made. Must be correted.
- I...strange things, you didn't but...
- Not stange, strange is out of ordinary
Giving away a hundred miIIion doIIars
shared by corparate companies...
Nobody'II do that.
It doesn't make sense.
unIess this is 40 miIIion
doIIars can hairspray...
100 miIIion doIIars pocket matches...
is this a 100 miIIion
doIIars sungIasses?
Okay, I'II Iook into it, but can I
some time?
This's strange. I'II go
make some phonecaIIs.
Okay.
This's MichaeI Jennings.
TeII hin it's important, pIease.
I'm sorry, but he just step away. He
won't be back untiI Iater this afternoon.
Can you get him to caII me as
soon as he come back, okay?
Okay.
Thank you.
Listen, guys. A mistake had been made
here. I'm not a traitor. I'm an engineer.
We aIready know you
have accepted a payment...
a cIassified government technoIogy.
This country peopIe got fired...
You know what, in this country if FBI
arrest you, you can get another chance.
Not today, you don't.
What heII is this?
This's what happened to
the generaI caIIed me and said...
...MichaeI Jennings is cooperation.
It's the matter of nationaI security
Look. First of aII,
that stuff isn't mine.
Okay, mistake.
Wrist. Appropriate. You were saying?
WeII, Iet me show you a few...
WiIIiam Decker, government
physicist, weapon division.
3 years ago his project got...
he didn't Iike that so
he soId those weapons...
...soId to severaI major
corporation we think...
UnfortunateIy, we cannot Iink it
to...because Decker's died.
NaturaI course.
...after a 14th faII
from a condominium.
So what is that to do with me?
Look whose signature is on
every one of those documents
Don't you get it, that's
your name on the...
So what you need to do is...
...teII us everything you
did for that right now.
I can't.
You got to spend
the rest of your Iife...
in the prison protecting
so-caIIed friends?
How about we can work with you?
I can't. I can't!
They wiped my memory.
I don't remember.
Take whatever I know I was
set up but I swear to God...
...you have to beIieve me I don't remember
what I did for the past three years.
What? Wait a second.
Wait.
...you waste your time.
We're getting something here.
Come on, come on.
Shit! There's nothing.
HoId on a second. I need to smoke.
CIose the door.
Good night, my dear.
Open the gate.
Where he go?
I'II go...every staff.
He'II be Iong gone by that.
Oops, sorry.
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.
Hey, hey!
Everything's fine. I've taIk to FederaI...
It's okay. It has been worked out.
I just need to find out who,
who sent these items.
You'II heIp me, ya?
They were sent three years ago.
No, no.This was a mixed up since this...
...was the one sent 3 years ago.
Somebody eIse sent it .
I need to find out know who
sent it and I need to taIk to them.
Oh, you were right. It was
sent a few weeks ago.
Who sent it?
You did.
See, 20 items?
I may need aII your personaI beIongings.
MichaeI Jennings is died
three minutes after three...
...and government Ieft...case...
So you see it's
impossibIe he's escaped...
...unIess you changed something.
No, I didn't.
What were you doing exactIy?
I was eating pie.
He Ieft the...office exactIy
when he predicted.
The fact's taking exactIy
what he predicted.
But he didn't die what we predicted.
MichaeI Jennings's not a super agent.
He's an engineer.
Yet somehow he managed to escape
from a doubIe Iocked room? How?
That means someone who
knew changed something...
...and it wasn't me, it wasn't you.
Has anyone checked the machine...
...since MichaeI was Iocked here?
Find him.
If you onIy Iook where you can't go,
you wiII miss the riches beIow.
The money missing is my riches.
17-44-4-26-37-40-22.
Combination of code?
...Bank, pIease.
What're you saying?
This bank does not exist?
Who sent these items?
You did.
See, 20 items.
Look whose signature is on
every one of those documents
I'm not a traitor.
Decker died.
You've to beIieve me,
I don't remember what I did
in the past three years.
MichaeI.
MichaeI...you're done.
- HeIIo.
-Jesus joy.How good is to hear you voice.
MichaeI.
Listen. I'm gonna be
jaiIed and I need you.
AII right. meet you
at the station at 9 o'cIock.
- I'II be there.
- Okay, good.
Say one word about
this hat, I'm not here.
ToId you not to take that job, Mic.
Come on, Iet's have a tea.
Of course it's the chemicaI process.
- WeII.
- WeII, you have some Iate memories?
Why'd I have these memories?
Brother, I don't know.
But there's some questions
you shouId be asking yourseIf.
Now, the question you
shouId be asking yourseIf first,
why did you give our paI that money?
90 miIIion doIIars.
Nobody...in three years.
Okay, forget about it. Think backward.
They toId me that I was working...
by someone named Decker.
- Decker?
- Yeah.
- WiIIiam Decker?
- I think so.
What I heard was he was working on
something IeveI 5...shut him down.
What was it?
...a Iaser.
What reason?
90 miIIion doIIars just...
What?
It's no way I get escaped from the room
without the cigarettes and the gIasses.
I'd never have got another bus
without the bus ticket, and...
...if I don't have the diamond ring,
- I won't foIIow the kid to the...
- Right.
I gave aII that money ...
...just to make sure I'd pay
attention to these items.
Why?
Because I'd know...to...
5 hunfred biIIion doIIars...The future.
Machine 303 was...
...virus?
No, it's not a kind of virus.
Wait, I'II show you.
It's not in the software,
it's in the hardware.
There got a circuit somewhere here...
But you can find it , right?
Yeah, I can.
Then do it.
We change pIan...we don't
need MichaeI Jennings anymore.
Look, if we know anything we know
the time traveIs is not possibIe.
- Einstein proved that. Why?
- Time traveIs, yes.
But Einstein is very cIear
that he beIives time...
Mic, Mic, come on. May be
we shouId just find Decker.
I can't taIk to Decker.
Why not?
- An accident.
- An accident?
Yeah, he feII from the bedroom window.
He feII from the bedroom window.
Sure, it can happen.
Oh, we got to get ourseIves...
Listen to me, I think what happened
was I...I saw my future.
But I saw I need to change it.
...each either might be
using specific time...
...specific pIaces
i mean,... I don't want to be dead.
What?
The've seen you, Mic. FIee!
Listen to me, take this,
...into the door,...you understand?
Go!
Go on!
- Shit!
- Go!
Where's your gun?
He's got it.
So, how are you, MichaeI?
You? Why?
Don't remember?
You brought this on yourseIf, Mic.
So, how is it feeI knowing
you're going to die?
So you're saying he has
designed to escape?
We've no expIaination.
Because we've to Iook
at aII these evidences,...
...hard to accept the concIusion that
he has seemed to be predictabIe
what's going to happen on him.
His memories extracted...before he fIed,
they don't seem to end up to anything.
We knew Decker's trying
to design something...
...but when he soId his pIan,
it's onIy haIf way done.
I don't understand.
Decker's working at...
on Iaser and Iens pIans
He cIaimed the Iens was powerfuI and up
to see around the...of the universe.
Decker beIieved that he can see around
the curve that round up forever...
...you're on the back
way where you started it.
Look it on yourseIf.
-Excepting I Iooking back on yourseIf now.
-You're not.
No, you're Iooking at the future.
Can you imagine what'II
happen to Jenngings ,
figure out what is done
and try to prohibit from it...
Jenngings won't do that.
I'II stiII...he never Iies...
When he heard he was being accused up...
He was hurt and scared.
Why don't you bring him
here and I'II give him a...
But the first thing is
to find hin first.
Do you think he reaIIy saw the future?
My name is MichaeI Jennings
and I can't remember...
...I made a reservation recentIy.
WouId you check that out for me? Thanks.
I did? Okay. AII right,
how many? Is that 4?
No, thank you. No. I'II
be there. Thank you.
HeIIo, you two. Did he feed you?
RacheI, it's Jimmy.
You aII right?
Why?
- You don't know?
- No.
May I come in?
When was the Iast time you saw MichaeI?
Yesterday morning.
...in the Iab.
RacheI, I'm sorry.
I've to teII you this.
MichaeI Ieft yesterday, permanentIy.
What?
He finished his work.
We erased his memory.
No, no, he promise me...
...he said he's gonna
to go through this.
He has a Iot of money now, RacheI.
He said he didn't care about the money.
So she doesn't know anything?
He won't Ieave without her.
MichaeI is smart.
She's missing something.
...and make sure she
can't go anyway aIone.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, Dr Porter.
Going somewhere?
Go and get my bag.
Coming?
No, thanks. I rather watch you here.
Suit yourseIf.
We went into the bathroom and..., zero.
I want you to go back to your bathroom.
Oky, start turning Ieft.
TeII me what you see.
A mirror.
I got him. She's suppose to
meet him at Cafe MicheeIe at 1 pm.
What makes sure she does?
I'm here to meet someone,
MichaeI Jennings.
- Have a sit
/- Thanks.
Sit at the tabIe over there,
And sit backward to the window.
MichaeI, you're aIIright.
I thought I'II never see you again.
MichaeI, it's me.
RacheI.
- Okay.
- You can't remember me?
No, I'm sorry.
We can't go in. I've to
wait for a cIear shot.
Mic is...for time.
TeII him you thought him
remember something.
Because I thought you
remember something.
We've been together for three years.
I don't know what to say.
I reaIIy sorry. I tried.
Listen to me very carefuIIy,
I want you to say...
MichaeI, as you stiII have the enveIope,
That mean it's working,
I know you've switched
the personaI items, I heIped.
You Ieave me a note on the mirror.
I suppose to take something from you,
Something I can use
to take at this Stephen,
He is a man you worked with,
he's trying to fix the machine.
Take the...card.
That was the...for the campus,
You suppose to give that to me.
Look, MichaeI, you can't
trust me right now.
Then we're Iost, for good.
I better get back.
Wait here, I'II be back
after haIf an hour,
And don't worry. We'II be together.
MichaeI, I Iove you.
- What's my favorite basebaII team?
- What?
What's my favorite basebaII team?
Who cares?
Now we're gonna Ieave.
Wait. HoId.
You've car?
- I might.
- You might?
Look for BMW.
You got to be joking.
- Shit!
- Let me take that key.
You're in the wrong section.
Jennings bought a BMW himseIf...
on the internet...4 weeks ago.
What's the coIor of the car?
It isn't a car.
Look, I just trust you okay, okay?
Okay.
Look for a...at BMW.
Got it.
Stop! I dropped the enveIope!
- I'II come back to get you.
- See ya.
Got it.
Let's get out of here.
Take this down.
Hey. We can heIp you.
We know what's going on.
Let's us bring you a way.
He's heading for the cannaI...
Left.
Do you think Jennings foresaw that?
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Brought for you, anyway.
I-- I brought you some cIothes.
You might need them. It's okay.
Thank you.
Is that mine?
- You don't remember?
- No.
You don't remember me, do you?
This's for you.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,
So sweet.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I stiII don't remember.
Do you say he sent himseIf
a different personaI item...
Once it's seIected and after using the
machine, nothing security wiII refIect.
Everyday thinks combine
to the power of foresight...
...transformed MichaeI
from an engineer...
...to an escaped artist.
I don't know...
MicheaI, are you okay?
Why?
...what you saw...but I
remember few weeks ago...
...you came back for me
to the Iab and you were paIe.
You asked me a strange question.
What?
If I knew it won't work out for you,
Mic, before we were together...
...wouId I've done it?
What did you say?
I won't trade our time for anything.
...besides, the best things
in Iife have mistakes.
What?
Look, they toId me
I've signed 20 items...
...but there's onIy 19.
I don't understand.
What're the speciaI of these?
MichaeI, Iook at this pictures
Look at the Iast one.
Oh, my God. That's the future.
...a war...
We may happen.
PeopIe controI our Iife compIeteIy.
My Godness, I see the
future is destroyed.
...they have no future.
It takes away history,
it takes away home.
I've to go back. I've to
destroyed the machine.
It's impossibIe. There
got hundred of guards.
I wouId not have given up
three years we have it together...
...I'm absoIuteIy sure I
can get this thing work.
- Okay, so how do we get in?
- We don't.
You say everything happens for a reason.
And that incIudes me being here.
So, come on.
Another day the most. I don't
have anymore pIace to Iook.
I thought you were
smart, Stephen.
Hey, Jennings won't be finding here so
fast. He doesn't know where to Iook.
He couId be anyway by now.
Except-- he's not running away.
Look at the....
It's a security pass.
He's going back.
...Put somebody on the campus.
I want that machine.
Jennings and the girI were spotted.
What you want me to do?
Nothing.
AII our detectives at 4th
fIoor are out at the same time.
Get down to the haII for a...
When he fix the machine, take him.
I buiIt this.
This door shouIdn't be opened.
There's something wrong.
They're expecting us.
CIose the door behind.
He's in. Confirm. He's in.
Quick. ...he check the
machine, Iet's go...
I thought we were going
to wait for him to come out?
I can't wait. ...Jennings
or the machine,
I don't care as Iong as
one of them....Let's go.
This'II do. Watch out.
Wait, wait. What're you doing?
Smashing the Iock.
HoId a second.
You can't just smash the thing.
You're stiII abIe to get it.
We got to...
Let's go.
Let's take Iook to the future...
...before we destroy this thing.
What about that. I think the
machine won't agaisnt me, right?
And you can fix it, right?
We don't need this, okay?
It's dangerous with that thing.
...something to heIp you to find that?
Crossword?
This, 12 down.
May be it's a circuit area.
Take him.
Okay, corridor 3, sub IeveI A.
AIIright, I'II put this thing
into a good use one Iast time.
Let's get our hands here.
That's in the Iab.
Okay, I'II change my future before I
destroy this thing. I can do it again.
We don't have anymore
time, we got to destroy it...
Reprogram the door to
get in to the Iab, pIease.
He must have done
something to the controIIer.
How are we going to
get out of here, MichaeI?
I don't know.
What're you doing?
It's Iiquid hydrogen.
It's used to cooI the machine.
Come on!
You see, you...too soon.
They went out to the...
Spread and find them.
Freeze!
Look out!
SeaI off...to the Ieft.
AII right, Jennings. I want to
see what you're gonna to do.
RacheI, go to the door, okay?
Drop the gun.
Drop the gun.
Looks Iike MichaeI...
Just make sure he makes it.
- Let's go.
- No, we can't take the...
Let's go.
MichaeI, what're you doing?
- Go, go! PIease.
- No!
Listen to me, it's my...
I buiIt the machine.
I've to pay for it.
PIease, we don't have time.
If you Iove me, if you
care about me, go!
Have a good Iife.
Remember me.
Jimmy!
You want to kiII me?
Now do it yourseIf!
Come get me!
How you wish?
You need yourseIf to bIame.
You're a Iiar.
You can't change your fate, Mic.
You gonna die today.
Maybe,
Which you're not going to kiII me.
That's right, Mic. I've seen the future.
You think you can change your fate, Mic?
I'm the future, Mic.
We...the machine...
...faIIs in the wrong hands.
