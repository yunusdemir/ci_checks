Wrong band! Out!
Next one!
Next, Petri Suominen.
Is that a stage name?
I guess not.
You're a genuine Suominen.
Then, Micky Mad Dog. Get ready,
Suominen won't be long.
Then, Hannibal.
Is it "Honey Ball"
or "Hannibal"?
ONE-WAY TICKET
TO MOMBASA
Produced and directed by
Alright! What are you
doing in the summer?
I thought I'd study.
Final exams next year.
We still have to figure out
if you're right for us.
This is No Future. Get it?
If not, it's FO, fuck off.
If yes, it's WC, welcome.
Next!
We'll be late, Petri.
Petri, you don't have to make
the same mistakes we did.
Mom, there are bands
and there are bands.
What's the rush?
You'll have nothing, if you
quit school now for music.
I wouldn't quit school.
- Promise?
Promise.
How old were you
when you started going on gigs?
It was in the golden 60s.
What if I joined a band?
Shift down.
What about the school band?
IX MUSIC TEACHER TUNE-UP
Slow down and
park the car nice and easy.
You'll learn. You have
your whole life ahead of you.
It's a real band.
Would you quit our band?
- I don't know yet.
I'll know tomorrow.
Don't tell anyone yet.
What time are you on, Petri?
- Do you have a girlfriend?
Jenni told me you have tattoos.
- The boys are rehearsing, girls.
Hurry up. Although
your Dad is a teacher.
And socialize with your
own age group. For once.
Play with your heart!
But play it clean! And hey!
Let's do...
Do "Holvikirkko" as an encore.
I have to be back at the barracks
in a couple of hours.
Where are you going?
- I don't have to tell you.
Kata! I won't wait for you.
Who do you think you are?
- Fucking cockteaser slut!
Go ask your mother
if the two can go together.
Sorry.
- You don't have to, Kata.
Did anyone ever treat you
like an object?
Dear colleagues, students...
The pride of our school:
The Cover Boys!
The first song
is dedicated to <i>you</i>.
<i>I miss you</i>
<i>Miss you so much</i>
<i>When you're not here</i>
<i>By my side</i>
<i>Come, oh come to me</i>
<i>Hurry up</i>
<i>I am dying to be with you</i>
<i>I'll go anywhere</i>
<i>If I can just hear your voice</i>...
Take it easy.
What happened?
- You fainted.
You're not using drugs, are you?
You never know with musicians.
How are we doing?
- You tell me.
How is the CRP?
- What?
We need to do
some more tests.
Cancer.
Lymphatic cancer,
to be precise.
You have tumors in both armpits.
It may have spread from there.
I'm fucking 17!
You'll get to the hospital
right away.
Go there tomorrow.
They'll rush the operation.
It's impossible to say anything
about your chances-yet.
Hi. - Hi. What happened
to you on stage?
Some... metabolic disturbance.
- Is it bad?
He came to make peace.
What shall I do?
If you like them bald...
What are you going
to do in the summer?
My plans are still open.
And you?
I'm going to work at my uncle's
in Saariselkä up north.
I want to take some distance.
I need time to think.
Rethink your values.
- Right, like a beauty queen.
But if you're up in Lapland,
come say hi.
I could try and get you a gig
there, as your local manager.
Kata!
Are you coming or not?
Don't get too excited.
It would be nice.
- Bye.
See you.
Don't try to cure this
by self-pity.
It'll kill you. I know.
Petri.
<i>How's the schoolboy? </i>
- Nothing much. No future.
<i>Alright! </i>
<i>That's the spirit! </i>
<i>It's WC, No Future Today</i>.
<i>We practice tomorrow</i>.
No cell phones in the hospital.
Let's go to the ward.
I'll go alone.
A new patient! Toivo Suulas,
medical student from Estonia.
Let's get the vitals: any bugs?
- Cancer.
You undress here
and then see doctor.
Here?
- Yes, yes.
Hurry up!
You not need own clothes,
you hospital property now.
Jusa! I've had it with you.
- Take care of him, will you?
Take the clothes back
to where you took them!
Petri Suominen?
- Yeah.
I'm Sari.
You can put your clothes in there.
This is your bed.
And this is Jusa, who has
been here for some time.
What's wrong?
Can I get you anything?
- Another room.
<i>In Mombasa</i>
<i>I spent a day, no more</i>
<i>Yet forever more</i>
<i>I remember Mombasa</i>
<i>I felt the humid heat</i>
<i>On the shores of Mombasa</i>
<i>The sea and sky of Africa</i>
<i>At first I saw</i>
<i>Just the sea so blue</i>...
<i>Love, brother! </i>
Nice feedback.
What is it now?
<i>Love, sister</i>.
Handle this, will you?
Is this all you can think of?
He'll be fine.
- He needs help.
You tidy up the mess.
Any calls?
- No. Or some Kata called.
What did she say?
- I told her to call back.
How are you feeling today?
- Still no guitar?
You must not strain yourself.
You know how your father is.
Your prognosis is really good.
Just don't give up.
I know that my son has guts.
It runs in the family.
Your prognosis
is not hopeless.
We'll start another one-month
cure after a small break.
Why? You just said
my prognosis is good.
I said it's not hopeless.
I can't make any promises.
I'll be 18 in the fall.
Or will I?
I wouldn't bet
my entire fortune on it.
But perhaps a hundred.
- But perhaps a hundred.
Sorry.
- Come in. I was just leaving.
Don't go yet. Don't go.
I have to.
Save some for tomorrow.
If you promise to be
faithful to me. - I promise.
Remember: be good.
What did you think of her?
Kind of old, granted,
but they know all the tricks.
Has your Mom
been here today?
Jusa!
Your parole officer suggested -
I bring you something better
to read than porn magazines.
Yeah, right.
Juvenile home bitches.
Their patronizing ends here.
- How come?
It's my birthday today.
- Happy fucking birthday!
Were you planning a big party?
Listen...
How about the extras?
Cheers.
To Mombasa.
- What do you mean, Mombasa?
I saw an angel,
a long time ago.
It was my first operation.
I woke up totally confused.
I was so sick.
The tape recorder
was playing "Mombasa".
Sari, the nurse,
was there by my side.
She was shining white.
She leaned over me,
gave me a kiss.
It was like a fucking...
- Religious experience?
I was so goddam horny.
It was like...
- Ecstatic?
What does that mean?
- Mombasa.
Mombasa.
<i>So few are made of iron</i>
<i>So many can't take the heat</i>
<i>Many never learnt how to cope</i>
<i>in this world without some help</i>
<i>Me, I'll alw ays keep trying</i>
<i>I just w ant to go on</i>
<i>And make sure I will keep</i>
<i>anything that I w ant to be mine</i>
The ward is full of sick people.
Who does she think we are?
Waiting for a fucking train?
I'm not a "sick person".
- That's the spirit!
Still breathing.
We have to call for help.
- Don't ruin my birthday.
We can't leave her there.
- What will you say?
"We didn't do anything
but come quick!"
Repola, the night nurse wants
to see you in the office.
Let's get laid!
Is she a good lay?
- Kata is not my girlfriend.
She could be, for all I know.
But she's in Lapland.
And I've always been more
like a brother to her. - Try pity.
Talking about lays...
What's up, girls?
- We're waiting for our boyfriends.
Here were are!
Fancy a drink to celebrate?
We just got out of prison.
Let's dance.
Don't!
What are you doing?
- He's bothering us.
Fuck off!
What the fuck...?
<i>Love, brother</i>.
Let's go back to the ward.
Why would I go back there?
My prognosis sucks.
No hope, no cure.
What would you do
if you had 20,000?
I want to get well.
Your taste in music really sucks.
Fuck! I want to go to Africa!
I want to get laid!
I want to see Mombasa!
I want to get to Africa
and get laid!
Where are you going?
Don't leave me!
Wait!
Who asked you to follow me?
Could you...
My Mom has messed everything up.
- Yeah, a real Petri museum.
"Did you vanish
from Planet Earth?"
"I really miss you."
"Your soul sister Katariina."
Now we can go.
I've never thrown out
a bank deposit book before.
And I've never been to Mombasa.
Let's go, Baldy.
One, two or three weeks?
- The longest possible trip.
Mom had saved my
child allowances for school.
I'll go to swimming school
on the beach in Mombasa.
How many passengers?
- Are you coming or not?
I'm going to Lapland.
Do you think she'll just
spread her legs for you?
I'm going to Lapland
and that's it.
Fine... Three.
- Hey!
When's the next flight?
We're in a bit of a hurry.
I haven't asked her yet!
- There is room a week from today.
You'll twist her arm in a week,
won't you?
This will only get you
two round trips.
How about two one-way
tickets and one return?
Two tickets then.
Is she coming with us?
- The machine picked up.
Send her a text message.
Sure! "I have cancer.
Let's go to Mombasa."
We're leaving in less than a week.
Great ass!
Let's stay here and party.
Do what you want to do,
I'm going to Lapland.
Take the little girls...
- Petri! Cool bald look!
Jenni said you beat up a nurse.
- And cops are looking for you!
The first train out of here.
<i>-The Northern Express is leaving</i>...
That's ours.
- Sure!
Come on, Saariselkä is
the Mombasa of Lapland.
The nightlife is wild.
- OK, but first class.
Now we're traveling in style!
You have no money left.
- First class is the best.
They never check the toilets.
I know from experience.
Or did you want to go see Kata
in a second class toilet?
"Fractured skull... Painkillers
taken... Contact your doctor..."
I always wanted to be famous
but not like this.
Make room.
Don't drink from the tap.
Or what?
If I'm taking us to Lapland -
you've gotta promise you'll
come to Mombasa with me.
Even if Kata won't go.
Let me sit.
Africa, the sun, the sea...
Palmtrees...
Ebony girls, rum and coke.
Can you imagine that?
- Easily.
Can you think of anything better?
Nothing can stop us now.
Couldn't your Kata pay for a cab
if she's so great?
They want the money up front
on long distances.
Bummer!
I've never been in a cab.
When I was thirteen -
I thought that once you've
gotten drunk, driven a car -
and gotten laid -
you've done it all
and might as well die.
Some fucking career...
I'd still like to play
on a big stage.
The king of sob stories.
To see Kata.
- Here we go: women.
Make your guitar sing.
Ha!
- You play the fucking guitar!
Fine!
<i>H- O-N-E-Y</i>
<i>Baby, baby mine</i>
<i>That's what I said</i>
<i>And made it clear</i>
<i>We'll marry in the country</i>
<i>I'm done with the city</i>
<i>You look so beautiful to me</i>
<i>I cannot put it more elegantly</i>
<i>H- O-N-E-Y</i>
<i>Baby, baby mine</i>
<i>You went out there in vain</i>
<i>Left the smell of conifers</i>
<i>And the good old moon</i>
<i>H- O-N-E-Y</i>
<i>Baby, baby mine</i>
<i>That's what I said</i>
<i>And made it clear</i>
<i>We'll marry in the country</i>
<i>I'm done with the city</i>
<i>You look so beautiful to me</i>
<i>I cannot put it more elegantly</i>
<i>H- O-N-E-Y</i>
<i>Baby, baby mine</i>
<i>I went out there in vain</i>
<i>Left the smell of conifers</i>
<i>And the good old moon</i>...
I asked for a coke and pizza.
- And I got you the real thing.
Legally for the first time.
Kata sent me a text message
offering a gig for tomorrow.
I said I'd be there.
- Blonds have all the fun.
All is well if your hair is well.
<i>There's just enough time for you</i>
<i>to shed bitter tears</i>
<i>The time has come</i>
<i>The night w as not enough</i>
<i>You cannot come along</i>
<i>It's time to say farewell</i>
<i>I'd like to stop the clock now</i>
<i>Silence down its every strike</i>
<i>Far aw ay I have to go</i>
<i>The last hour is at hand</i>
<i>But I know this now: I'm yours</i>
<i>And alw ays will be yours</i>
<i>I will not forget the teary eyes</i>
<i>I left behind</i>...
Fuck you!
Come on! Let's go and see
if the broads are still there.
How often have you scored
by begging? -Often enough.
I've just gone so many weeks
without it that it hurts. Ouch!
Take a pill.
Or will she do us both?
You can shove Mombasa
right up your ass!
You wouldn't even live
if it weren't for me!
<i>This is Mom</i>.
<i>Where are you? </i>
<i>Petri</i>...
<i>Mom here. Call me</i>.
<i>Where are you? Call me! </i>
<i>Mom here</i>...
Mombasa, anyone?
Straight, and then to the right.
Straight ahead.
Then to the right.
This is fucking great.
This is fine, but could
we leave the square now?
Not a good combination.
- Are you never in pain?
I've decided to take it.
Like the Indians.
They had to hang from
their thumbs till morning.
No complaints.
They just had to take it.
In the morning
the entire tribe cheered them.
They were, like, heroes.
They were men.
Are you nuts?
It's not that
I can't take the pain.
I just don't want to
take any drugs now.
To Mombasa.
- To Mombasa.
Hey, cell phone hero!
Could you call us a ride
with the magic block?
Ambulance or police?
I've heard -
that if you throw a cell phone
over your right shoulder -
and make a wish,
your wish will come true.
I've never tried that.
Need a ride?
We're heading up north.
You could've wished
for a female driver.
Where is that musician, Kata?
Or will you entertain
the guests yourself?
He'll be here. He promised.
We talked about a gig.
Ladies and Gentlemen -
we have the pleasure to
introduce our musicians.
They will sing us original
shaman and ethnic songs.
<i>I'll never stray from this path</i>
<i>Till my life will be over</i>
<i>If my darling, </i>
<i>I'll have you by my side</i>
<i>On this path we will find us</i>
<i>The ultimate target</i>
<i>Where, my friend, </i>
<i>we will w ander hand in hand</i>
Pay day, boys.
You have a great future ahead.
Somewhere else, I suppose.
When does
the wild nightlife begin?
Nightlife begins in November.
It turns wild in February.
Very funny.
What are you going to do next?
- See Mombasa and die.
We'd better get going...
You could stay with me.
- We could...
One night!
I'll get the keys.
I get off in an hour.
You can go there now.
Yeah, right...
Down the hill, first on the left.
- "The Mombasa of Lapland."
Don't be like that, Jusa.
Did you ask her?
- I can't ask right away.
You wanted me to get you
to Lapland, to get laid.
Then: hasta la vista, Jusa.
- You wouldn't leave me alone.
You even bought the fucking tickets
although I said I'm not going.
Is it so fucking hard to understand
that I don't want to be alone?
You have a mother,
a father and Kata, dammit.
I won't leave you.
All I want is some respect,
for once in my life.
Is my hair OK?
When will you ask her?
- I don't know.
When the moment is right.
Or afterwards.
We've got four days.
This is going a bit too fast.
I need to tell you something.
- Can't we just take it easy?
OK?
We have all the time
in the world.
What's up, Don Juan?
Or is it Brother Rabbit?
Why don't you just tell her?
I don't want her pity.
You don't have much time
for anything else.
What would I say?
"Listen, Kata. I have cancer."
<i>I'm gonna die about soon, </i>
<i>if not right now."</i>
<i>It's better than: "I just came</i>
<i>to say that I love you."</i>
"And hey, remember to come
to my funeral in the fall."
"Yeah, and Jusa has it too."
"He bought the three of us
tickets to Mombasa -
<i>because he needs a witness to</i>
<i>prove that the doctor lost her bet."</i>
"Darling, as long as there is life,
there is hope, Bob Hope."
Kata really cares about me.
I felt it.
But you still didn't score.
A car!
Fancy a ride?
What's this?
- I borrowed it from my uncle.
I wanted to see you.
Before the funeral.
Take me instead of him.
I'm better looking.
And I'll die sooner.
Are you really going
to go to Mombasa?
Go with us.
What do you expect me
to say to that?
We're out of gas.
This would go faster
without the handbrake on.
Have you ever driven a car?
<i>The weather-vane is up on a rooftop</i>
<i>Many never notice it is there</i>
<i>When there is no motion</i>
<i>The weather is quite calm</i>
<i>It gets to rest for awhile</i>
<i>The weather-vane</i>
<i>Sits up on a rooftop</i>
<i>Alw ays at the mercy of the wind</i>
<i>The birds may hear it question</i>
<i>Where do they disappear</i>
<i>Into the wind when they fly</i>
<i>Like the restless weather-vane</i>
<i>My heart, the troubled one</i>
<i>Like the wind it w ants to go</i>
<i>This restless heart of mine</i>
<i>Restless, alw ays free to follow</i>
<i>Any wind that happens to pass by</i>
<i>When such hearts pass by</i>
<i>I have to ask myself</i>
<i>Why do I stay where I am</i>...
A bit more.
How long do you think
Jusa will last?
I don't know.
The doctors don't know either.
Would you go with us
if I really asked you to?
I don't want to go without you
but I have to.
I'd like to be with you.
But it would be too much that...
It's better if you don't ask.
Let's go!
Hi, I'm Rosebud.
Veeruska?
I'm going to the Vöyliö
dance hall to hear a band.
It's right on our way!
Right, only
a hundred kilometers off.
Look who's talking!
It's less than a thousand.
Do you want to touch it?
It's sexy.
Don't you want to hear
some music, musician?
Sure, but it costs to get in.
Are you broke?
With that car?
I don't have enough.
- I'll take care of this.
You're an angel.
Did you come get me?
Would you get me a beer?
What's wrong?
I'd play here tonight
if I wasn't sick.
But if I wasn't sick...
I don't know.
Hi! Quite a statement
with the bald head.
Bet you've never
been backstage.
What's eating you? Our lives
won't get any better than this.
Double baldies!
What's the story?
We've toured Finland as a duo.
- What's the name?
Blood Brothers.
- What's the clue?
Do something you've never
done before. And do it today.
That's the spirit!
Gotta stay sharp.
Listen, Petri.
Why don't you get up on
the stage with us tonight?
WC.
Where's my bud?
And the bag?
Hi, Rosebud.
Did you find your cousin?
Did you call me Rosebud?
- He meant me.
But you're Angela.
I'll just take my bag. You two can
join the circus, for all I care.
Great drugs. Now beat it.
- Let me use your cell phone first.
I hope that you die. Now!
Palmtrees...
Ebony girls...
And the beach.
Sorry, but I can't explain...
The only thing missing
is shining angels.
You're our angel.
My angel.
You just don't get it
because you have each other.
Like I deserted you...
I've never...
been with a woman.
And never will.
Dammit...
- Stop!
What's wrong?
- I have no more drugs.
I have some painkillers.
- Too weak.
VETERINARIAN
There!
Hi, Petri here. Don't...
It's just the alarm.
Mom, I know what I'm doing.
Just listen!
Is any of the following
a painkiller...
Hang on...
Here we go...
Bye.
How come
the engine isn't running?
Were these the biggest
goddam pills you could find?
It said "horses".
Is it a preventive dewormer?
- No, it's an anti-lust drug.
What the fuck am I doing here?
Do you even care
about my feelings?
If your life was never the way
you wanted it to be -
why would the end
be any different?
Promise not to tell anyone
the thing about women.
I can't handle
any initiation rites now.
I just wanted to...
- Did you know this?
He's never had anyone.
You can't be serious!
Why are you doing this to me?
- I'm not doing this to you.
You won't lose anything.
Do I look scary?
From a distance.
But not up close.

<i>I spent a day, no more</i>

<i>I remember Mombasa</i>
<i>I felt the humid heat</i>
<i>On the shores of Mombasa</i>
<i>The sea and sky of Africa</i>
<i>At first I saw</i>

<i>And corals hit</i>
<i>By rolling giant w aves</i>
<i>Through the splash of w aves</i>
<i>You emerged so suddenly</i>
<i>You came ashore, laughingly</i>
<i>And then a shell</i>
<i>So white and porcelain-like</i>
<i>You handed me</i>
<i>Looked at me smilingly</i>
<i>I touched the shell so white</i>
<i>And its surface kind of rough</i>
<i>Like your body fresh from the sea</i>
<i>A burning wind</i>
<i>I felt it on my face</i>
<i>But in your arms</i>
<i>You took me to the w aves</i>
<i>Underneath the surf</i>
<i>In my arms I felt your strength</i>
<i>So w arm</i>
<i>And salty from the sea</i>
<i>When evening fell</i>
<i>The surf gave in as well</i>
<i>Into the bay</i>
<i>A simple foam just sw ayed</i>
<i>In my sleep I heard</i>
<i>Just a distant leopard cry</i>
<i>I touched you gently once again</i>
<i>In Mombasa</i>
<i>I spent a day, no more</i>
<i>Yet forever more</i>
<i>I remember Mombasa</i>
<i>I felt the humid heat</i>
<i>On the shores of Mombasa</i>
