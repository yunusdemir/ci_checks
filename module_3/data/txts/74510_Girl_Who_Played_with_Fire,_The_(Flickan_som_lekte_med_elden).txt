Stieg Larsson's
The Girl Who Played With Fire
Hello. Welcome.
Come here.
Yes, like that. Much better.
Will you be good to me?
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.
It's too late.
Solicitor Bjurman?
Yes?
This is regarding a police file
dated 1993. Lisbeth Salander.
My employer would like to take a look at it.
Really?
And who is your employer?
I have the case files stored at my retreat.
- Do you have copies?
- No.
- Is she still abroad?
- Yes, most likely.
Thank you.
Bjurman?
I will stay in touch.
You're supposed file reports about me to
the Guardianship.
- I do.
- Each month. You're sloppy.
- I have some reports stored at my retreat.
- Shut your mouth.
If your reports say I'm
behaving well,
I will let you go when I'm no
longer under the Guardianship.
If you can't do it, I'll send
our movie to every newspaper in the country.
If something happens to me,
or if I die, it will be made public.
And if you touch me again,
I'll kill you.
And one more thing:
If you visit that clinic in Marseilles
for tattoo removal,
I'll redo my work.
On your forehead.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Is this Zala?
Nils Bjurman.
You're interested the police file on
Lisbeth Salander.
I have it
in a safe place.
I'll let you have it, but only if you
take care of Salander first,
She has a DVD
which belongs to me,
When I have it,
you'll get the file,
She's back in Sweden,
and probably not difficult to find,
- Do you still see her?
- Who?
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I haven't seen her in a year.
- Why is that?
- I don't know.
One day we'll talk.
The next day she won't answer the phone.
We must go now. Dag Svensson
will show up at the editorial meeting today.
- Dag who?
- He writes about human trafficking.
The girls from Eastern Europe.
- What kind of guy is he?
- Freelance. Young and bold.
- Fit.
- Fit?
- For how long have you been working on it?
- About four years.
I found the subject through my girlfriend.
She's researching gender and is a criminologist.
She's pursuing a PhD.
in human trafficking.
So you work as a team?
No, Mia focuses on the girls.
I focus more on distributors
and the span of customers.
And what have you found?
I have found
several prominent customers.
Amongst them
someone from the Justice Department,
who participated in
shaping the new sex market legislation.
Three police men,
one from vice,
one from SEK.
Five solicitors
one judge and one prosecutor
The affected girls -
are so low on the social ladder
they're irrelevant to the justice system.
Crimes against young Eastern European
girls is not a priority.
A whore is a whore.
That...
...is a part of the system.
How far have you progressed?
- I've completed the research.
What's missing is checking the facts -
and confronting the customers I want
to expose.
Hang on.
The last time I didn't check my facts properly,
I spent three months behind bars.
Everybody will get their
chance to comment on the allegations.
There is no need for you to worry.
The documentation is water proof.
- That sounds reassuring.
- Yes.
Okay...
We don't pay any huge salary.
I suggest
a two month project position.
You can have a desk there.
- Does it sound good?
- Yes, excellent.
We're poking our heads out with this
case. We have to realize that.
That is supposedly the whole point of
of Millennium?
- That's why we're sitting here.
- Yes, welcome to Millennium.
Thanks.
Sandstrom?
Sandstrom?
- We have a job for you.
- I don't think...
Yes, we do, actually.
Hello, Armanskij.
May I come in?
More than a year.
What do you want?
Do you need a job?
Do you work someplace else?
I have been traveling.
I just recently returned to Sweden.
- Where have you been?
- Here and there.
Australia, New Zealand.
The last few months in the Caribbean.
I don't know why
I didn't say goodbye.
Because you don't really
care about other people.
You treat people trying to be your
friends like shit.
It's that simple.
Blomkvist has been looking for you.
He's called at least once
a month to inquire about you.
He cares as well.
Just like Holger Palmgren.
It has been two years since he had a stroke,
and you haven't even visited him.
Is he alive?
You don't even know
if he's dead or alive.
You've been missing.
I've been traveling.
I had to run away for a while.
Have you been worried?
No. You can do anything.
That's how it is.
How are things with the new...
...guardian?
Bjurman.
He's okay.
It's okay.
And you're still forced to be
under the supervision of a guardian?
Don't worry about me.
I'll fix it.
It's no longer your job.
No, I'm too old.
I'm just a silly, old fool.
Yes, you are.
Truly silly,
if that's what you think.
- I thought you were dead or something.
- Or something.
We didn't meet that often
before you left.
- I was busy.
- It's good to have you back.
I only know one person
who dares knock on the door -
after one and a half years of silence
to ask if I want to fuck.
...then I broke up with her and
went to Paris. Mom and dad lives there.
I worked in a club
near Clichy.
A fantastic place.
But I had applied for law school,
and been accepted.
- Mom found the letter and told...
- Do you want my apartment?
- What?
- Do you want my apartment?
- Are you moving?
- I have already moved.
I can't afford buying anything.
The rent has been paid for a year.
Do you want it?
- There's just one thing.
- I assumed that much.
I'm still registered here.
My mail is sent here.
You'll take care of it.
I can do that.
Where do you live?
- Someplace else.
- Can I visit?
No. Not now.
But you'll come over to fuck me
when you feel like it?
I'd like that,
but it's not a part of the contract.
You're not wired properly.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Come here.
Damn, I have something for you.
There you are.
Happy birthday.
- This isn't my birthday.
- It's from last year.
If you're going to keep smoking
that crap,
you might as well do it with elegance.
You are the only one
who gives me presents.
- How are you?
- I'm good. Excellent.
Or just OK. I'm trying to get a hold
of one of the customers.
A policeman from SEK.
Gunnar Bjorck.
But he's nowhere to be found.
As if swallowed by the earth.
It's hopeless.
- What do you have?
- A PO Box address.
A PO Box address?
Try the lottery trick.
- What?
- The lottery trick.
Write to the PO Box
and tell him he's won...
...a monster cell phone with GPS
and that he's one of 20 selected
to win 100.000 if he'll participate
in a market research study.
Is it legal?
It can't be illegal
to give away a phone?
Say you're from
Indigo Market Research.
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.
We're hitting the press next week,
so we're fucking busy.
Are you the only one
working in that paper?
Everybody's working like animals.
I need more time than the others.
Micke has begun confronting
some of the customers.
He's so experienced
they crap their pants if he just...
It's finished. Printed.
Yes.
It's already finished?
"From Russia With Love".
"Organized crime and
human trafficking".
- By Mia Bergman.
- That's me.
My girlfriend.
- We have to celebrate.
- Yes.
Give me a kiss.
- Give me a kiss.
- It's finished.
Lovely food.
Truly lovely, Annika.
Why do you tell her?
I did the cooking.
It's quite tasty, Annika.
- Why don't you get married?
- Leave him be, aunt Angelina.
- He doesn't want to.
- Why not?
He's so handsome.
Mikael, do you have a woman?
You must have a woman.
Yes, I have a woman.
- So marry her.
- I'd love to, but she's already married.
Hi, am I interrupting?
No, I'm at my sister's and
half a platoon of her husband's family.
Sounds nice.
About the pictures...
They are on paper, and Mia
and I leave for Dalarna tomorrow.
I don't know if I should send
them with a messenger,
No, don't use a messenger.
I'm leaving soon.
I can give you a lift.
- I'll stop by.
- Great,
and one more thing.
I want to run a name.
A criminal named Zala.
Tell him he's Anton
in my dissertation.
- Did you hear that?
- Don't give me new material this late.
No, I know,
but I think it can pay off.
- We'll talk about it later.
- Yes,
Two minutes.
- Did something happen?
- It sounded like a gunshot.
Just now.
Dag?
Hello? Hello?
But you reported it?
Yes.
- Did you see what happened?
- No. I found them.
It can't have been
more than ten minutes after...
Do you have a description?
Did you see anyone run away from the scene?
No.
Maybe the neighbors saw something.
Do you live here?
No, I was going to visit
the couple living here.
I'll be back.
Hello? Blomkvist?
We have a couple of questions.
You can't have that here!
The murdered couple
was a journalist and a criminologist.
They were found by another journalist.
Blomkvist from Millennium.
- What do we know about the motive?
- Not much at this point.
The girl was about to get her PhD.
in a couple of weeks.
This case has the highest priority.
Assemble a task force.
- Hans Faste, Jerker Holmberg.
- Sonja Modig.
You can pick out the team yourself.
But make it quick.
Ekstrom, prosecutors.
You described the murders
as pure executions.
Which ones on the list are capable of that?
And getting away with it?
We're about to publish the names of
several persons
who'd prefer to stay out of the spotlight.
Some of them
had already been contacted by Dag.
- This is speculation.
- Shouldn't we hand the list over to the police?
- Yes, I suppose we should.
- No.
They can have the names of some customers,
but we must never reveal our sources.
It's about the safety of those
girls Mia interviewed.
It can be life or death.
Back to the first question:
Are we printing this?
- I think that's what Dag would've wanted.
- Agreed.
Christer?
Sure.
We have received a temporary report
about the murder weapon.
- It's illegal?
- No, it's perfectly legal.
It belongs to
solicitor Nils Erik Bjurman.
Acquired in 1983.
He's got an address on Gardet.
There you go.
We could also identify
two sets of fingerprints.
A woman born in 1981.
Arrested for assault in Gamla Stan
in 1998, when the fingerprints were taken.
- Do you have a name?
- Her name is Lisbeth... Salander.
Lisbeth Salander
seems quite disturbed.
She's under a legal guardian.
Guess who the guardian is?
Solicitor Nils Bjurman.
The owner of the murder weapon in Enskede.
She was already violent in school.
Psychiatric treatment as a teen.
We think she supports herself through prostitution.
And documented
violent tendencies.
- Do we have Salander's address?
- Lundagatan in Sodermalm.
Stop! Police.
Cross the street.
- Have you arrested Salander?
- No, we're waiting for backup.
- Call me.
- I'll call when we're done.
Hookers have no class anymore.
They look more fucked up every day.
Would you pick her up?
There has to be a simpler way.
Why call in the storm troopers
to catch one small fish?
The girl is 150 cm tall
and weighs 40 kg.
We're in
but the apartment is empty.
Affirmative.
- Faste?
- Yes?
Why did it say Salander Wu
on the door?
Have no idea.
Hello, this is Bjurman. Please leave
a message and I'll get back to you.
Hello?
Hello?
Snap one from that angle as well,
so we get it properly.
She's in there..
Thanks. My coffee craving was
about to kill me.
What have you found?
Bjurman, and an empty Magnum bullet box.
We're checking it for prints.
And copies of monthly reports on
Salander,
which he's been sending
to the Guardianship.
According to the reports
Salander is basically an angel.
We have turned him around.
There is something you should see.
"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist."
- What do you think?
- Not a bad motive for murder.
LISBETH 28
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS
SOUGHT FOR THREE MURDERS
IN ENSKEDE
HUNTED FOR THREE MURDERS
JOURNALIST BLOMKVIST
FOUND THE MURDER VICTIMS
This afternoon another
victim was found.
The 56 year old socially committed
solicitor was found shot in his apartment.
Police is investigating
if the murders are connected.
One of the victims worked for
the newspaper Millennium,
where Blomkvist
is editor in charge.
According to Blomkvist,
Svensson was about to write about
IT security and hackers.
It's a great loss
for his family and colleagues
and the whole journalist community.
A brutal attack
on free society.
- Why did you tell them that?
- Because it's true.
One of Dag's specialties was hacking.
We had agreed that it would
be his next case.
And I want to find a certain person
before the police does.
Lisbeth reads everything I write.
No matter where she is.
And she's quite interested in the subject.
This statement might make her contact me.
- You have no doubts?
- About what?
No.
- No?
- Lisbeth has not murdered anyone.
- That's Dag's phone.
- I'll get it.
- Indigo Market Research.
- Good morning, my name is Gunnar Bjorck.
I have received an
interesting offer from you.
THIS IS WHERE POLICE FOUND IRINA
DAG SVENSSON'S RESEARCH COPY
- Which documents were she looking for?
- The e-mail log from Svensson.
Or his research.
- Can you track her?
- No. She doesn't work like that.
She's got a reason to stay hidden.
- Do you think she's guilty as well?
- I'm not saying anything.
I know she hasn't done anything.
Not this time.
Why do you ask, mom?
The fucking police did it.
The pigs!
This place looks fucking awful.
I don't know.
She has vanished.
Wait, somebody is at the door.
Hi, Miriam.
Tony Scala, journalist.
Your girlfriend
is suspected of three murders.
Can you confirm that you
spent time abroad with Salander?
You have to talk to the media
sooner or later. I can help you.
Go to hell, you fucking pig!
A double espresso.
Why do you think Lisbeth is innocent?
She had no reason to kill Dag or Mia.
Especially not Mia.
Mia wanted to expose human trafficking.
Sounds like something Lisbeth could've done.
Lisbeth detests men
who hate women.
We have proof she was at
the scene of the crime.
- So you found fingerprints?
- Yes, she's connected to the murder weapon.
That doesn't mean she
pulled the trigger.
- And Bjurman? Her guardian?
- The answer lies in Svensson's research.
This is a police matter. We do not need
private detectives and their wild theories.
I have no theories. I'm stating
that Lisbeth did not kill Dag and Mia.
I want to present evidence.
I want to point out an alternative killer
and write an article you and your
peers won't like ...at all.
- This is Bjorck.
- Hi, this is Indigo.
- Good, did you receive the travel instructions?
- Yes, that's not a problem.
This lottery and the cell phone ...
You're still one of the 20 selected.
- Have we met before?
- No.
You seem familiar.
Maybe you've seen me in the paper.
- What was your name again?
- Mikael Blomkvist. Journalist.
I work for Millennium.
I didn't know
you do market research.
Sure, sometimes.
Look at these three pictures
and tell me...
...which model you prefer.
First off, this is Lidia Kamarova.
She is 16 years old
and from Minsk in Belarus.
Then we have Myang So Hun.
She is 25 years old, a little older,
but it doesn't show.
She's also called Jo-Jo.
She's from Thailand.
And then we have Silvia,
her real name is Jelena Barasova.
She's 19 years old and from Tallinn.
You have paid for sex
from all these women.
So what I want to know is
which one is your favorite.
- Is this a joke?
- No.
Our journalist Dag Svensson had
documentation proving
that you paid them for sex.
- Did he contact you?
- Who?
- Dag Svensson.
- I've never heard that name.
- Now I want you to leave.
- Yes, that might be so.
He did not manage to confront you
with the documentation
before someone shot him.
Do you know solicitor Bjurman,
who was also shot and killed?
What do you want?
I want to allow the sex buyers to
comment on the facts
in our next theme issue on
human trafficking.
You do understand that you will
ruin my life if you print this?
Yes.
Several visits with Irina
Check Anton = Zala
Come on. Get up.
Get up.
I'm going to ask you some questions,
Per Ake. If you answer, I'll let you live.
If you refuse, I'll zap you again.
100.000 volts.
If you lie or answer confusingly,
I'll zap you.
Your muscles will stop working,
and you'll hang yourself.
And I'm leaving.
Understand?
I don't want to die.
My mistake. I forgot to tell you that
you can't speak without my permission.
- Is this your daughter?
- Yes. She'll be here any minute...
You're breaking the rules again.
- Do you want to die?
- No.
In January you visited Irina
in an apartment in Norsborg. Why?
I don't know...
I wanted her. She was beautiful.
- Beautiful?
- Yes, she was beautiful.
And that gave you the right
to tie her up and fuck her?
You are a sadistic pig and a rapist.
Isn't that so?
Who is Zala?
- I don't know.
- Don't abuse your chance.
I don't know who he is.
The journalist you shot asked about him as well.
If I knew I would tell you.
I only spoke to someone who said
his name was Zala.
- One minute on the phone.
- Why?
I was supposed to import a car
with amphetamine from Tallinn.
I didn't want to.
They showed up a few days later
and told me I couldn't pull out.
Then they forced me
to come with them to...
- To?
- Some storage facility.
The first thing I saw was a man
on the floor, beaten to a pulp.
- And he was there...
- Who? Zala?
No, a blond fucker.
Pure muscle.
I've only seen him once before.
Damn.
- What's his name?
- I don't know.
What else happened?
They said the guy
on the floor was a snitch.
The blond raised him up
on a chair in front of me.
Then he put his hands
around his neck.
I heard his neck snapping.
He died before my eyes.
Then the blond wrapped his
hands around my neck.
Magge held a phone to my ear
and told me Zala wanted to speak to me.
What did he say?
Zala?
I was to do as I was told.
What choice did I have?
Hello.
We have to get back.
I have a lunch meeting.
Have you been in contact with her?
Who?
Who do you think?
An old friend called this morning.
He's also convinced
Lisbeth Salander is innocent.
- Who?
- That's completely skewed.
Erika?
It's best if you meet and
discuss it yourselves.
Jab, Paolo! Come on!
Give him a jab!
Move your feet, man.
Concentrate on your foot work. Come on!
Don't give up.
From where do you know Lisbeth?
We've boxed together since
she was 17.
- Not in the same weight class.
- She's quite tough.
She's in trouble, yes?
She's in deep deep trouble.
Paolo, you have to help me.
I need to get in touch with
Lisbeth's girlfriend, Miriam Wu.
- Have you read about her?
- I know her. Kick boxer.
She refuses to talk to me because I'm
a journalist.
If you, as a known boxer,
talk to her...
And try to reach Lisbeth through her?
Fuck...!
Come on!
Micke? You asked me to dig into
Gunnar Bjorck's past.
I ran into Nils Bjurman.
He was an officer in the security
department of the National Police Force.
- What? When was that?
- From '76 until '78.
- Same time as Bjorck.
- Fuck...!
- Where is she?
- Who?
- Lisbeth Salander.
- I told you, I don't know!
Wrong answer.
You have one more chance.
Then I'll start using this.
Run, Miriam!
- Hello?
- Micke, it's Paolo,
I'm at the hospital
with Miriam Wu.
- What?
- Would be nice if you could come by.
I didn't shoot Dag and Mia.
If you want to help, find Zala, Lisbeth.
I can give and receive punches,
but he was no ordinary human.
- What did he look like?
- A blond, armor penetrating robot.
- He was pure muscle.
- And you never saw him before?
Never.
He moved exactly like a boxer.
He kept his guard up,
but at the same time seemed completely clueless.
- Clueless in what way? On drugs?
- No, it was very strange.
As if he had trained,
but never listened to his coach!
And then there was something
fucking scary.
I hit him rock hard.
About 100 punches went straight in.
But nothing happened.
As if he didn't feel anything.
- Hello. Ward 1B?
- Further down the hall.
Jan Bublanski.
- How are you?
- Splendid.
I'll find a place where
we can talk uninterrupted.
- How is Miriam Wu?
- They're still examining her.
She looks like me.
It wasn't her they were after.
It was Lisbeth Salander.
We have identified 29 customers
and pimps from Dag's list.
In theory, they all had a motive
to murder Dag.
Eight names are missing.
We've given them pseudonyms.
- What are we doing about them?
- Malin is trying to identify them.
Some of the pseudonyms are
mentioned in Mia's dissertation.
We can find references there
which can lead to the names.
First I'd like to visit the
Dag wanted to expose.
- They have the most to lose.
- Then we can do the following.
Sten Falstrom, done.
He's done.
Karl Pettersson, done.
Per Ake Sandstrom.
He's been confronted by Dag,
so we'll expose him.
And the guy from the security police force?
Bjorck?
What about the connection between him
and Bjurman? What about this Zala?
I'm not completely finished
with Bjorck.
- It's Bjorck.
- Blomkvist here. You never called.
What do you want?
You lied to me. You and Bjurman
worked together at SAPO in the 70's,
Why would I tell you
who I worked with?
Tomorrow I'm holding a press conference
regarding the murders of Dag and Mia,
I will give details about
our article series on sex trade,
and you're the only customer
I'll expose.
So you'll have the opportunity
to comment.
You want to destroy my life.
Why would I talk to you?
Since you know Bjurman,
you probably know Zala as well?
Hello?
You know who he is?
What is that information
worth to you?
His real name is Zalachenko,
but he's called Zala.
What I'm about to tell you now is
top secret.
You understand it's important to me
that you guarantee source protection.
I've already done that.
Zalachenko was born in 1940
in what was then the Soviet Union.
Both parents died during the war..
I assume you know what GRU was?
Yes, the military intelligence.
He made his career in GRU.
Speaks six languages fluently.
Expert in camouflage
and survival techniques.
Over the years he became
more and more corrupt.
GRU sent a military attache -
from the embassy in Madrid
to find him -
and correct his ways.
Something went wrong
during that conversation.
Cut to the chase.
Zalachenko killed the
man from the embassy.
He realized he had burned all bridges,
went to Sweden, contacted the
security police and applied for asylum.
- And?
- The actions of the government?
When a soviet top spy
applies for asylum?
Never before had an operation's chief
for one of GRU's elite commands
deserted to Sweden.
- So he could stay?
- Yes.
- And started working for you?
- He was a gold mine.
We gave him a Swedish identity,
a passport and some money.
From then on he managed on his own.
In return we received good favors for
the information he provided us.
What about Bjurman?
Where does he enter the picture?
Bjurman...
We were young back then.
What were we? 25? 30?
Not really qualified to handle
someone like Zalachenko.
He came to us
on election day in '76.
Hardly a soul to be found
at the police station.
Everybody had time off
or were busy with the election.
I was the officer in charge, and considered
it a common immigration matter.
I brought Bjurman as caseworker.
His further involvement
was completely random.
- Random?
- Yes, actually.
"Praktvindel." (Beach Moonflower)
- What?
- That's what it's called.
- Where is Zalachenko today?
- I don't know.
I had his case until 1985.
I then received other tasks.
You gave him a new identity
and a Swedish name. What is it?
- That I won't tell you.
- Come on.
You wanted to know who Zala is.
I'm not saying more until I know
you're true to your word.
I believe Zalachenko committed three murders,
and the police is hunting the wrong person.
- Why isn't Salander the murderer?
- I believe Zalachenko did it.
You are mistaken.
Zala has not murdered anyone.
He's 69 and somewhat disabled.
Walks around on crutches. He's not been
running around shooting people.
If he wants to commit murder,
he'll have to order welfare transport.
I hope I won't have to see
my name in your paper now.
What do you want for it?
Half. 200.000.
Cash.
Okay. I don't have the money here,
but we'll go pick them up.
- When?
- At once.
I'll go pick them up.
- How did it go?
- With what?
What do you mean?
Bjurman's retreat, you were
supposed to burn it to the ground.
We... We were just about to.
We haven't had time yet.
No time?
We'll fix it right away.
We'll pick up the money afterwards.
We'll be right back with the cash.
Okay?
I'll wait here.
What the fuck...?
It's that little bitch Salander.
We've been fucking looking for you.
Not even your little girlfriend
knew where you were.
At least that's what she told us.
Right, Magge?
Fucking carpet muncher.
I think she could use some cock.
Try it.
Move, fucking retard.
What the fuck are you doing?
Oh shit...
Knock her out, man!
- There is something you don't know.
- What is that?
About Reine.
Love, nostalgia ...
A 35 year old male was shot today
in a cabin area.
The man was taken to hospital.
His condition is not critical.
Police said that shooting might
be linked to...
...murders in the suburbs Enskede
and Gardet, Stockholm.
We have a couple of traffic reports
from Radio Stockholm.
Emergency vehicles are on their way
from Sodertaje to Svavelsjo.
We're asking all motorist to pay
extra attention.
He has agreed to meet you.
But if he doesn't like you,
he'll throw you out on your ass.
And you can't interview him
or write anything in the media.
Who are you calling yourself
Lisbeth's friend?
My name is Mikael Blomkvist.
I know you've been bothered
by journalists,
but I'm not here for an interview.
I'm here for Lisbeth.
I don't think she's got anything to do
with those murders.
I believe a man named Zalachenko
is behind them.
Sit down.
Zalachenko.
- Alexander Zalachenko.
- You know who he is?
He's Lisbeth's father.
Lisbeth's mother, her name was...
...Agneta Sjolander.
She was only 17 years old
when Zalachenko met her.
When Lisbeth was born,
her mother changed her name
from Sjolander to Salander.
Zala... Salander.
Zalachenko was seldom home.
But he showed up in between
at the apartment in Lundagatan.
He got drunk,
abused the mother.
Forced her to have sex.
Then he disappeared.
This happened dozens of times.
The municipality should have intervened,
but they did nothing.
Not until 1993.
What happened then?
Attempted murder. She tried to kill
her father with a fire bomb.
Lisbeth was 12 years old.
Zalachenko laughed
when Lisbeth found her mother...
...unconscious on the kitchen floor.
He went out and got in his car,
but Lisbeth ran after him...
...and threw a milk carton
filled with gasoline into the car.
A man burns like a torch.
My God.
And this time
it had consequences.
Lisbeth was taken...
...and ended up in a children's
psychiatric ward in Uppsala.
Her mother was admitted to hospital
during those few years she had left.
She never recovered.
- About her having psychiatric problems...
- Peter Teleborian.
He got her admitted
to psychiatric care.
On the other hand, her father,
Alexander Zalachenko, received no punishment.
God damn ...
Hello.
Alexander Zalachenko.
Does the name tell you anything?
- No. The press conference is about to start.
- He's Lisbeth Salander's father.
She assaulted him
with a fire bomb in 1993,
and the police investigated the matter.
Notice that it was the security police.
- Why?
- Zalachenko worked for them.
He could not be identified.
Officially he doesn't exist.
- He's not listed in any public records.
- And how do you know this?
You will go find the old case file,
if it's in there some place.
I think it can lead us to Zalachenko.
I'm convinced he's got something to do
with the murders in Enskede.
Mostly likely the murder of
solicitor Bjurman as well.
Contrary to Lisbeth Salander?
- Her fingerprints are on the weapon.
- I know it sounds peculiar.
Peculiar, indeed. Why are you
so interested in Lisbeth Salander?
If she's innocent,
why won't she turn herself in?
Lisbeth is...
...a very private person.
I don't like that you're constantly trying
to create a lead.
We have enough problems. We'll solve
this case without private investigators.
Welcome back.
Paolo Roberto saved
Miriam from the flames.
Do you still consider Lisbeth
a danger to her surroundings?
She has shot a person.
She is armed.
Of course we'll capture her.
Do you know who was behind
Miriam's kidnapping?
We'll pass on that question to
lead investigator Bublanski.
A man involved in
this morning's shooting incident
was possibly the driver during a
previous kidnapping attempt.
- The man who was shot?
- No comment.
The one abusing
Miriam Wu and Paolo Roberto...
...left no traces.
And you have no description of him?
We've had this drawing made.
It's based on witness descriptions.
It's a large, muscular male
around 35-40 years old.
Built like a body builder.
Short, blond hair.
The drawing will be made available to everybody
after the press conference.
Police informed that they have not
apprehended the 28 year old woman,
which after the shooting incident
in the cabin area at Strangnas
fled the scene on a motorcycle.
According to information available,
it may be gang related.
They have no fucking clue!
Bublanski didn't listen.
They are locked in on one single lead.
If the police apprehends Lisbeth,
anything can happen.
- Where are you going?
- Home.
- Should I come with?
- No, I wouldn't be pleasant company at the moment.
You don't have to be.
And you, Teleborian,
are even more critical.
You're calling it a scandal
that she did not receive treatment.
I won't comment on individual cases.
But I have to say that
certain complex cases...
...require qualified treatment.
I can only say I'm sorry
that three people lost their lives
as a result of the budgetary cuts
in psychiatric care.
So this woman should be locked up?
There are patients
who should be institutionalized
instead of moving around
freely in society.
I know who Zalachenko is.
I have talked to Palmgren
and understand Teleborian's part,
and why you had to be locked up
in the children's psychiatric ward.
I believe I know
who killed Dag and Mia.
But I don't understand Bjurman's part in this.
Turn yourself in, we can solve this.
Thank you for being my friend.
It's me.
Okay.
Did he look like this?
He was horrible.
A real monster.
Fuck.
Fuck, I'm sorry.
You're the one they were looking for.
But you know that?
What have you done?
Paolo said Blomkvist contacted him
to get to you.
- What is there between you two?
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?
- There is something I have to finish.
What the fuck...?
There was a lady in here.
A short blonde, she left.
I'll bring you something to help you sleep.
I'll be right back.
I should've done it a long time ago.
Inside. Inside!
I want to see your records
of rented cars.
- They are on the computer.
- Turn it on.
Come. Slowly.
Open the closet.
Give me your cell phone.
Go inside the closet.
And I won't have to hurt you.
- Where do you keep your rental contracts?
- In a folder on the shelf.
I need to rent a car.
I'm leaving 10.000 here.
You will get your car back.
Thank you for being my friend.
Hello, it's Miriam, Miriam Wu.
Can you stop by the hospital?
- So she's been here? When?
- A few hours ago.
Did she say where she was going?
No, Lisbeth doesn't do that.
If she tracks down that monster,
he'll kill her.
Here. She forgot these.
- Forgot?
- No, she dropped them.
They fell out of her backpack.
I have no idea where she lives.
Do you?
- What is it?
- Looks like a PO Box key.
- Can you use this?
- Yes please.
Hello?
Lisbeth?
Gothenburg Traffic Radio. There's been
an accident on Grabovagen, road F90.
The accident has caused traffic jams,
and traffic is moving slowly.
The social board in Biskopsgarden requests
support for measures against domestic violence.
It's most certainly called an apple core.
Back to pretensions.
In retrospect, what is the
most pretentious work you have written?
This picture is 17 years old.
His name is Ronald Niedermann.
He was 18 when he was caught
so today he's 35.
- Where did you get the picture?
- Dynamic in Hamburg.
Like I told Micke, he's not worth
jack shit as a boxer.
But he moved like a boxer,
so somebody must've coached him.
I e-mailed several boxing gyms
in Europe.
Told them what had happened
and tried to describe him.
He has an illness.
He was born with analgesia.
- What is that?
- I looked it up. Genetic error.
The nerve synapses do not work.
You feel no pain.
- Yes?
- Hi, this is Malin.
Paolo has identified the blond.
Good.
- Where are you?
- It's a bit hard to say.
- You sound strange.
- What did you say?
Paolo knows who the
blond boxer is.
- His name is Niedermann.
- Great. Do you have the address?
All we have is a 17 year old picture
from Hamburg, Germany.
Hello? Micke?
Try to find him in the phone book.
I'm on my cell phone. Good bye.
Will you be good to me?
Will you be good to me?
Then I'll be good to you.
It's too late.
Hello, it's Malin.
I think I have something now.
There is no Niedermann
in Sweden's public records.
But in '98 a shareholder company
was registered...
...called KKAB Import.
The chairman of the board is named
Karl Axel Bodin, born in 1944.
Third member of the board is
a man named R. Niedermann.
- Do you have an address?
- Yes.
Karl Axel Bodin
is registered in Western Sweden -
with address PO Box 612
in Gosseberga.
Neat...
- Erika?
- Hi. Where have you been?
- Come!
- What is it?
We can't keep information from the police
in the middle of a murder investigation.
That's not what we're doing.
I want to ask you for a favor.
This is Bjorck's report from 1993.
It contains parts of
Bjorck's and Teleborian's...
...correspondence about Lisbeth.
Can you make a copy of it and
send the originals to Bublanski?
I'm leaving for Gothenburg.
I want to find her before the police does,
and be there for her.
I owe her that.
Be careful!!
Mikael, really...
Hello, father.
- Yes?
- Bublanski and Modig is here.
They just read the report
about Salander from '93.
Now they want Bjorck's address.
Can we give it to them?
They can find it themselves.
How hard can it be?
They're the fucking police.
Let me speak to him.
Blomkvist, I think it's best that you come
in and give us your witness statement.
I have no time for it.
I'm not in Stockholm.
Where are you?
Remember that I'm a private snoop and
I don't understand jack shit.
Don't be childish.
I'm also doubting Salander's guilt.
May I talk to Erika again?
- Yes?
- Give them Bjorck's address.
I'm turning my cell phone off now.
I don't want to be traced. Good bye.
You set off every alarm on the farm.
Movement sensors?
You look like shit.
But you have my eyes...
Are you in pain?
No.
I have given you some
thought over the years.
About every time I look in the mirror.
You should've left my mother alone.
Your mother...
Your mother was a whore.
No. She was a cashier and tried her best
to make ends meet.
You can think what you want
about your mother.
But she was a whore.
I hated you.
- But I have forgiven you.
- Bullshit!
Bjurman hired you to kill me.
That was a whole different matter.
That was business.
You had a movie he wanted.
And I'm running a small business.
Did he really rape you?
He must've had some
fucking bad taste in women.
Sit!
Sit down,
or I'll shoot you like a dog.
- Where did you find that retard?
- You really haven't figured it out yet?
They claimed you're a
really good researcher.
Obviously not.
He's your brother.
- What?
- Correction, you half brother.
The result of a recreational incident
a long time ago in Germany.
Did Niedermann shoot Bjurman as well?
Why?
Bjurman was a moron.
He had papers that were mine.
He was one of very few
who knew about my background.
I could not trust that he
would keep his mouth shut.
Especially not when journalists began
meddling in our affairs.
That was the drop.
You made too many mistakes.
The police will identify you.
Oh, I'm scared.
No, I didn't shoot anyone.
I'm just an old, wounded invalid.
Ready?
I should probably say something.
But I have nothing to say to you.
That's okay. Neither do I.
Let's get it over with.
Fortunately I managed to catch you red handed.
The police will come tonight.
Bullshit!
I was waiting for you to make a bluff.
You came here to kill me.
You didn't talk to anyone.
May I show you something?
Everything you said the last hour
has been published online.
May I see?
No, this isn't one of those.
Idiot!
What are you waiting for?
Come here! Come here!
It's me.
It's me.
Lisbeth...
Thank you.
