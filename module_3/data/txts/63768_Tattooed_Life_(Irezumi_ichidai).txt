NIKKATSU CORPORATION Presents:
THE BLIND WOMAN'S CURSE
I am Akemi, successor
of the Tachibana Group
I am obliged to kill Boss Goda
Shut up!
You'll all die!
Get them!
Directed by TERUO ISHII
Don't kill him! Brother!
- Get hold of yourself!
What is it, No. 36?
It's heaven only when we sleep
Dragging us into hell!
It's every night!
What'll you do?
I'm sorry I bothered you. Excuse me.
Tell us the reason!
I've been cursed by a cat.
By a cat? Of all the silly things!
It's the truth.
It loves blood.
It lapped up blood spurting out
Then it leaped at my eyes.
All deathly pale Just in heat!
Same here!
That cat's better!
It's no laughing matter!
What did you do? Come on, greet us!
Can't you answer me?
If you can't, this snake will!
Afraid not.
Come on, greet us!
I see. My greetings then.
I'm going to greet you all
here. Especially the leader.
Pretty good?
I head the Tachibana Group,
Succeeding Sennosuke, my father.
My surname is Tachibana. My
given name is Akemi.  I am new
Please remember me and
please help me in the future.
3 YEARS LATER
Know this is Tachibana territory?
Who're you talking to?
Wait!
Don't act big cockroaches!
You've no place in the sun!
Not bad looking. Just my type.
A nice smell
You smell like you haven't
had a bath in a year.
A lot of nerve.
Can't just go.
What?
Wait!
Buying this fight!
Whoever you are, defy me and you're out!
Smelly! Don't pollute the air!
What else?
No Boss, no henchmen and no moral code!
Stay away! Get hurt!
Like me a little!
No Boss, no henchmen!
But the similarity ends there.
I hate everything crooked!
Take it easy! A little talk...
What is it?
We're pretty much alike.
I'm willing to bow out.
I see.
We're even now.
Okay
Leaving men! Stop!
It's not their first time.
If we'd crushed them sooner...
Tatsu, a right hand man
shouldn't say such things.
Uncle.
Don't call me that.
I promised Akemi's father,
so I'm going straight.
I'm sorry. You always scold me.
I don't want to!
Don't say things to
excite the young men!
Father.
Be Still!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
Greetings!
How many times do we have to say it?
Your boss!
We're busy and she has
no time for nobodies!
Not my taste!
We were in the pen with your boss!
Understand?
Funny in the head? Doesn't understand?
Same tatoo? They fit! I'm excited!
Tail's over there.
No head or tail. Let's be friends.
You're back boss?
What's on your backs?
We want to become your family.
Come on in.
Back, boss?
Letting hoods do this...
Let me at them first!
They're human derelicts.
They've blown the place by now.
Somebody's behind them!
Watch your mouth!
Can't settle things with him in the way!
I know how you feel but wait
till we know more.  Understand?
What about the cops?
They understand but they went too far.
Excuse me a moment.
Serve the guests something.
Mr. Tani, I believe. Thank you for today
Those hoods were nothing.
I hear someone's pulling the strings.
In your world, only the strong remain.
Being lenient will cause more trouble?
A lecture?
Forget it. I talk too much.
You fight too much. 9
lives aren't enough for you.
Lending a hand was wrong?
Lent a hand?
Never mind.
I've more than enough men.
I don't need your help.
No use for me?
I'll have your meal fixed.
And money to travel.
Don't make a mistake!
I don't do things just to get paid.
Somebody
Kantaro, the guest is leaving
A dream I'm after. I'm a dreamer
Even if I die, I'll dream forever
I'll dream forever and ever
Wait!
I said I was leaving
Boss says you can't go.
Says you've got to eat
A stubborn boss
My father says so. We run a restaurant
You shouldn't leave without eating.
He sounds nice.
You're back?
A fine bath.
Hungry?  Please.
Have a drink.
Please eat.
The best cooking.
It's great!
You can marry any time!
It's father's cooking.
A great cook!
Anybody can be taught if they want to.
Why don't you try it too?
I've thought of it, but I can't
Your parents gave you your body.
It's not right to treat it lightly.
Yes, but it's too late now. Both my...
You're all alone?
There's nobody to laugh or cry for
me, no matter where or when I die.
It's turned into a sad story.
Pour for him, Chie
Become my brother then.
Listen, Father. I'll reform him.
You!
I couldn't say it before
Uncle. It's Dobashi.
We know, Pal.
To your left above the stone wall
- Dobashi's room.
Pal!
Hisao!
Taken care of.
Exactly like you planned it.
Say a last word to them
You were pals until a while ago.
Don't joke, Boss Dobashi!
Rat!
Betrayer!
I've no tatoo of a Dragon's tail on
me.  I'll choose the group I serve!
A good excuse to raid them?
Yes, but I won't
After all this trouble!
Wait.  You're a greenhorn yet.
I intend to send Boss Tachibana
a bouquet instead of a sword.
Thanks anyways.
Instead of that...
I know.
If I get Tachibana
territory, I'll set you up.
Thank you.
Where's the driver?
"Returning your two killers in coffins."
"It's action now, not words."
"Just a reminder."
Open it!
Hisao.
Suekichi.
I said not to cause trouble.
Too late to say it now!
We'll make it rain blood!
Let's kill every last one!
Be quiet!
Don't stop us this time!
Be still!
I'm the angriest.
And the saddest.
Exchanging drinks, we said we'd die
together even if we were born alone.
Making them like this. I can't
forgive it.  I'd like to kill them!
And i will!  I promise you!
But wait!
There's a reason.
When I find out what the
reason is, I'll settle it good!
Pal.
Fool.
Pal!
Koji!  Get a hold of yourself!
My eyes!  I can't see!
I'm cursed.
She won't rise to my bait
to raid the Aozora Group.
On the night of the wake, a man
acted like a cat and vanished
With girl henchmen she
can't even get revenge.
Is it that easy?
Who're you?
I came to see Boss Dobashi.
Boss?
Some of his men tried to stop me
by force, so I made them be quiet.
Made them quiet?
Two men done in!
Don't worry. Just a light pat.
You bitch!
I know by the smell.
Not popular with women?
About 5 broken teeth by the feel of it.
Boss?
I smell?
Boss Dobashi. Want to
hire a woman like me?
Strong and pretty too.
I've no reason to refuse.
That Aozora Group!
Hisao and Suekichi are lucky to
have you mourn for them so long
I hope Koji returns safely
People's lives are more
important than a name
Why don't you disband
and lead a peaceful life?
Uncle.
I don't think your late father
would be angry if he knew.
Chie.
You've become charming all
of a sudden. Lonely for a man?
Don't joke!  I'll tell father!
He went to the cemetery.
That's why I came.
Let me go! No!
If you want to you can
become the wife of a boss!
Stop it! Let go!
I'm not lying. I'm going places.
Let's talk it over.
Wait a minute.
Important talk. Listen.
Tell me. I'll do anything for you.
Really?
You've a man's word.
But, it's embarrassing.
Never mind.
You'll let me go?
Go?
Well...sure. I'll let you go.
I'll go then.
Go?  Go where?
Toilet.
Can't even become smelly friends?
You jerk!
A face like half-baked dough.
Where's Nobuko?
That blind bat.
Nobuko wanted to see this.
What's going on?
William Tell shot an
apple off his son's head.
He had sharp eyes.
But she can't see, so
she's better than Tell.
This is her real work?
Anyone want to be the target? You?
How about it?
Please applaud her.
Can't she see?
Not a phony?
All right? She'll do it again.
A nice tatoo.
Take good care of it.
The great Kantaro's back!
Where's Nobuko?
I don't know.
What's the idea? It's stopped.
Hanged herself!
It's Nobuko!
Let her down.
"Got one dragon tatoo.
I'll get you all."
"After the tail, the body."
It's cruel!
The Aozora men did it! No mistake!
Yes! Let's fight!
I didn't tell you, but in the pen,
a cat often attacked me in my dreams.
I may have done something to be cursed.
It's not me alone.
But everyone with a
dragon tatoo like me.
It must have been agony, Nobuko.
Forgive me!
Found Koji's body.
As if to take his place Hanako vanished.
Hanako gives us trouble!
Say, it's skin!
Somebody come here! Skin!
The cat!
It ran up on the roof!
Say, buck up! You're Kantaro
of the Tachibana Group!
Wax dolls? So good they seem alive!
How cruel.
Why'd you do it?
I thought you'd be glad.
Fool.
I hate to ask other people
for help. You know that.
Don't follow me around any more.
I was wrong! Forgive me!
Spare me of that!
Skin off Hanako's back?
Yes, I'm sure it is.
That cat was licking both skins!
Let's go to the theatre!
The blind woman and hunchback left.
It's true!
Don't lie!
"Getting the dragon's head too."
Listen...
What are you doing?
It's none of your business.
I didn't think I'd see you this way.
Hello.
Are you well?
Yes thank you.
I'll help with half.
They're waiting.
Excuse me.
This please.
Sorry, no small money.
Big money?
Funny woman.
Fool.
They scattered that stuff.
Opium in Tachibana
territory.  That'll end them.
Better report it to the authorities.
Just the job for you!
Kisakata Police Station.
It's Tachibana territory! A mistake?
Selling opium.
Tachibana Group? Terrible!
Who disgraced our group
by selling opium secretly?
Come out!
We'll do it.
We'll get our territory
back. I promise you!
Kantaro.
Men. Me and the girls
will look after our boss.
You scatter till it blows over.
Take us along!
I'd like to.
If I could. I wouldn't take to the road!
I'll see you off. Go.
Hurry!
Kammo.
Hide.
Go.
Boss.
I wish you luck!
You too.
Take care of boss!
We expected you, Dobashi!
What of it?
Not you, punk!
Say, don't you know Iwa the monster?
Know yourself, don't you?
What's all the fuss about?
Using us to hog Tachibana's
place. No you don't!
What! You beggar!
Ask your loincloth if
you're the boss type.
What's that?
You're so dirty and
it's showing through!
I'm cleaner than your heart!
Get them all!
Who're you?
You smell bad but you're not
a bad man? Let's talk it over.
I see.
No gain fighting here.
Why not go 50/50 on the territory?
If I refuse?
I know you. If a woman
asks you, you won't refuse.
What now, skunk?
Boss agrees.
Okay! Settled!
Will you come with me?
Why not take a bath?
Serves you right!
Making money?
Tatsu... I mean boss.
Been a long time.
How are you?
Let's meet again.
Yes. Excuse me.
Look around in my place.
Sake, old man.
Say, answer!
If I'm displeased, you can't work here.
Say, understand what I said?
I'm boss Tatsu Semba and this
place has become my territory.
Never heard of that.
I do remember Tatsu, a
punk with a heart of stone.
I've no sake for beasts!
Geezer! Feeling big yet?
Rough him up.
What's the fuss about, dough face?
I'll get even for this!
Fool!
You all right?
A mess.
What's the matter?
Something bothers me!
A woman?
A funny woman I'd seen
just talked to Tatsu!
Fingering things at Stalls.
She hid opium among the goods?
I see.
Let's contact Miss Tachibana.
I'm borrowing Chie!
Yes, we may be able to catch her!
It's that woman!
Stop it!
Let's see what's inside!
Let go! I'll scream!
Go ahead, if you can!
Let's be friends.
Who told you to do
it? Can't you tell me?
Dobashi?
Don't ask if you know!
You went around scattering opium.
Let's go and see Dobashi.
I'm going to Dobashi's.
Tell your father.
Come on.
Get ahold of yourself!
Look after her.
Come with us.
Stop it.
Be quiet!
Pretty worried, arent you?
Worried about Chie? I have her.
You!
Don't get mad. Don't
get ideas or she'll...
Come along.
Tatsu, you're...
Shut up! Shaming me before others!
You're human trash!
Take him away!
How'd you find out about the opium?
Out with it!
We have other torture methods!
More evens? Odds?
Enough bets.
Wait.
Don't cheat honest people.
Trying to pick fights here?
No.
But phony dice by the up and
coming Dobashi Group is bad.
Where's your proof?
Excuse me guests.
Excuse me.
Feel the dice. That's the proof.
It's made so only odds come out.
Shall I try?
This is the trick.
Phony dice!
Don't play here again.
I'd like to see you a minute.
I was going to ask you.
Where are you going?
To see Dobashi.
Turn right at the end of the
corridor, to the basement.
Thanks
You betrayed us!
I hate dirty tricks!
I smell it.
A nice man.
Dobashi!
Who're you?
In bed already, at dusk? Kid's bedtime!
Lending me this?
Don't fuss!
Or your boss is dead!
Whoever you are, how much do you want?
Cough up what you plot
in your balck belly!
Cough up what?
Two Tachibana men were sent
back in coffins. You did it?
First I heard of it.
Don't lie!
Want to die?
Wait!
Telling me? I know and ask.
It's Tatsu, a Tachibana man's idea.
He wanted to destroy both Aozora
and Tachibana by making them fight.
But Tachibana wouldn't fight.
You had Tetsu skin the tatoo off
a Tachibana girl and kill her?
No, I didn't do that.
Liar!
It's easy if you use a betrayer.
Where's her skin?
Don't move!
Drop your knife.
Drop it!
Wait! Don't kill him.
He'll die after getting
twice what he did to me!
Water play with a sweet girl.
While you catch your breath, she drowns.
Nice and chummy, dripping wet.
Let her down!
How do you like playing in the water?
Rat! You can't kill me!
Fool!
Be plain!
He didn't die!
Put her in that room!
He's the limit!
Why are you here guest?
Humpback!
The nerve! Kill him!
Fools! It's your fault!
Have a bath and then have her.
I see. There's fun left.
You've got a smooth body.
It's called 'rice cake' skin.
The girls I take all cry with joy.
Mirror.
I can hardly bear it, imagining
how the sweet girl will cry out.
They call this a real
he-man, a handsome face.
What's so funny?
Was it painful?
I'll love you plenty
now. You needn't feel shy.
It's depressing.
Trying to seduce me, boss?
Blind bat.  What's the idea?
Are you after a showdown?
Fun, my foot!
I'm sorry.
Pull it up.
He's dead!
Who did it anyway?
How was it?
Gone.
It's funny. Nobody's at the shop.
Uncle sent a telegram, so I
did think it was very important.
What happened?
Let her lie down.
What is this?
Dobashi's doing!
What's this strange thing?
The soba shop man?
"Tatsu killed this man"
Uncle!
Tachibana Group's at Fujuku -Tei.
The hunchback through in the head.
Let me!
The Tachibana Group?
That hunchback's on their side!
That blind bat, too, then?
Take care of her before
they get together!
Yes.  Use that room?
I'll get her.
Be careful of your head.
Boss'll be here soon.
Gutter rat.
Dying full of water.
How could he do this cruel thing?
He reformed so he could
die in bed like decent men.
I involved him.
I'll let my body apologize for me.
I know my dying won't bring him back...
But please bear it!
Let's get young men.
Yes, let's make it rain blood!
No, there's no need for numbers.
Uncle, you said reforming
came before family name.
Forgive me for going against your words.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll apologize then.
Please take me with you!
All right.  I'll look after her.
You won't turn me down today?
I'll hand them out.
A parting drink!
A woman boss in a world of men.
It's a funny laugh then laugh again.
I ask no mercy. I see things through.
And on my back, a dragon tatoo.
Tatsu, you disgrace our world!
A woman's dishrag dance.  This is fun.
Apologize now girls, and
I'll use you as maids.
Dobashi, a showdown!
I'm bunching up!
When it ends?
Don't attack your superior!
My teeth jump out when I'm mad!
Hurry!
Wait.
I've been waiting for
a showdown with you.
Who are you?
I'll tell you later.
Please remember... you made me blind.
I'm the sister of the late Boss Goda.
Boss Goda?
Don't kill him! Get ahold
of yourself, Brother!
It was you that time?
So you waited for me?
Yes, for five years...
I trained to kill people.
I waited for our duel.
And now your wish has
come true. I am here.
I'd like to see your face.
When we kill, we're all demons.
Miss Tachibana, fight!
I lost. Kill me.
You held back, didn't you?
Wipe out your five
years of pain and hate.
No my sword cannot kill someone
with a pure mind like you.
I spent my life foolishly?
