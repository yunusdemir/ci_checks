You're late, doctor.
I had to wait until the others were in bed.
Can you fight it?
If I couldn't,
you wouldn't be alive to ask that question!
Barnabas, I must warn you
the serum may be highly toxic to your system.
Doctor, whatever the outcome,
nothing could be worse than this.
I suggest you make haste.
My baseline sample.
This will burn.
Hot tentacles stretch upward.
A knife.
A knife slices through my arm.
Now it's cutting through my shoulder.
My blood boils.
Gone.
The pain. Gone.
Silver in my veins.
One day,
we will see the dawn
together.
(Julia)
Record of serology experiment, B.C.One.
My plan is to divide subject's initial
blood sample
into 12 separate control units.
After each inoculation, a new blood
sample will be drawn
so that subject's change in blood chemistry
can be accurately charted over
the course of the experiment.
The first test will be to establish
the effect of the sun's rays
on the original baseline sample.
It's so wild out here, it could
be a thousand years ago.
Or a thousand years hence.
Here time stands still.
Doesn't even exist!
Wouldn't that be wonderful?
Perhaps I shouldn't have brought
you out on such a night as this.
Oh, no!
It's exciting! I feel so free as if I could fly!
"She walks in beauty like the night,
of cloudless climes and starry skies."
"And all that's best of dark and bright,
meet in her aspect and her eyes."
No. No!
Victoria, don't go there!
Stop! No!
No, Barnabas, no!
Don't go there! Please!
Josette!
Don't be afraid of me!
Stop!
No!
Barnabas?
What's wrong?
You shouldn't run about here like that.
Barnabas, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm alright.
This wind is so loud, it's almost human.
They call it the Widow's Wail.
Legend has it that on stormy nights,
the wives of the fisherman would come
here to search for their husbands' ships.
Many a wife became a widow here.
And more than a few decided to join
their husbands on the rocks below.
Barnabas,
Is this where Josette died?
Yes.
Anybody around?
Where is everybody?
Mrs. Johnson!
Anybody around?
When we having dinner?
Anybody in there?
Hey, it's me. Who's in there?
Oh, Carolyn.
You really scared me.
Where is everybody?
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Carolyn, will you say something?
She's after me!
She's after me!
Help! Help!
Help me!
David! David!
David, it's alright.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
It's me. It's Vicki.
Nobody's gonig to hurt you.
Come on, sit up.
Boy, that must have been some dream.
You want to tell me about it?
It's Daphne. She's still trying to get me.
No, David, it was only a dream.
I don't care.
She's coming back to get me.
And get you, too. And Carolyn.
David, Daphne's gone.
She can't ever come back again.
I don't care what you say.
She was dead the last time.
She's coming back.
Look, why don't I turn out the light now,
and I'll sit here with you for awhile?
Would you feel better if I did that?
Okay.
David!
Sarah!
You almost gave me a heart attack.
Where you been, anyway?
Away.
Don't be afraid, David.
Daphne is gone.
She will never come back.
Are you sure?
Yes, David.
Good and gone, gone for
good, forever and ever.
"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."
Daphne is ashes, Daphne is dust.
Daphne is gone.
Her pain is gone.
But there is another in pain.
And someone who needs your help.
Who?
I can't tell you, David.
Why?
It's someone you know.
Someone who is very close to you.
Who is it, Sarah?
-"London Bridge is falling down"
- Wait. Don't go.
- "Falling down, falling down"
Tell me!
"London Bridge is falling down"
Sarah!
Sarah, who is it?
Sarah, why do you always go away?
(Julia)
<i> Week 10.</i>
<i> Progress continues.</i>
<i> Although subject's blood still
vulnerable to sun's rays,</i>
<i> it's resistance grows daily.</i>
<i> Barnabas has not fed
for over 2 months now.</i>
<i> I am convinced that it's
only a matter of time</i>
<i> until he is ready to face the dawn.</i>
<i> and I shall be the cause
of his newfound freedom.</i>
The injections are getting
easier to endure.
Because your blood chemistry
is almost normal now.
You should start to feel a little warm.
And quite soon you'll notice
other characteristics
like the rest of us.
For example, I can see a gray hair.
Hey! Yeah!
I never noticed that before.
Hey, you're getting gray, Barnabas.
You'll find that growing
old isn't that much fun.
Not growing old has meant
the curse of eternity.
Believe me, I look forward to aging.
Julia,
I can't wait much longer.
It's been a long winter.
Barnabas, we cannot endanger
our success by rushing this.
However, I think it is time
for a little experiment.
All right, Willie.
Ok, doci?
Uncover it, Willie.
Go ahead, Barnabas.
Look.
The first time I've seen my reflection
in 2 centuries.
I thought I was somehow...
taller.
Willie,
we shall hang mirrors in
every room of the house.
Yeah, sure, Barnabas.
In every room in the house.
You must be patient, Barnabas.
Everything you want is going to come true.
And when it does,
I shall owe it all to you.
And to you shall I give all my thanks.
Soon. Soon, my Josette,
we shall be together again
as it was meant to be.
I'm sorry. I brought you lunch.
Are you okay?
I've got to get out of here.
Why? You're just starting to get better.
Just too many memories here.
Everywhere I look.
It's going to take time, Joe.
But there are people
here who care about you.
Hey. Hey, don't get me wrong.
Y-You've been great to me.
But I just got to get my head together.
I mean, everywhere I
look, it's like I'm ...
it's like I'm living a nightmare.
You know I'm--I'm thinking of
fixing up the old putt-putt
heading down to Bimini, and
trying my luck down there.
I'd miss you if you did that.
That was a wonderful dinner, Michael.
You certainly haven't lost
your touch in the kitchen.
It's about the only place I haven't.
So how's your work going?
- Very well, as a matter of fact.
- Mmm-hmm.
Well, you've been here a long time, Julia.
Now that Daphne's gone, uh,
what's left to do?
Well, I'm still treating Joe Haskell.
Don't play me for the fool.
I know why you're still here.
Really?
Why is thati?
No matter how much you protest,
you do believe that it was a vampire,
and you're waiting for it to strike again.
But that's absurd.
Whatever you say, Julia.
But we both know,
the real threat is still out there.
It hasn't just vanished into thin air.
And Patterson agrees.
He has 3 unsolved murders on his hands.
and even a small-town sheriff should
be able to find out who's new in town,
and who's never been seen during the day.
And what have you 2 sleuths come up with?
Barnabas Collins.
Think about it, Julia. He certainly
fits all the prerequisites.
"Clinging to our separate souls,"
"we plunge through time"
"entwined to journey's end
on some eternal shore."
That's beautiful.
May I see it?
It was written by my namesake for Josette.
But it might have been written for you.
Barnabas, what's wrong?
Nothing.
Are you alright?
Yes.
- But --
- Victoria, please.
Please, you'd better leave now.
Willie will escort you to Collinwood.
Barnabas, please tell me what's wrong.
I just don't feel myself.
Please, Victoria, don't
ask me anything more.
All right.
Barnabas, I'll go if you want me to.
But what were they doing, Willie?
Barnabas and Miss Winters.
They weren't doing nothing.
Well, then why was she there?
Well, they were talking and stuff.
But then Barnabas, he started
getting like he does and--
And what, Willie?
And I don't-- I don't want him to
hurt Miss Vicki like he did Daphne.
That's all. I just...
I just don't want him to do that.
Barnabas?
It's now, Julia.
We can't wait any longer.
I'm losing control.
Tonight, the urge to take
blood almost overcame me.
I managed to suppress the malignant hunger.
But it took hold with such strength.
Such ferocious, insatiable force.
I almost succumbed.
Barnabas, it would be a terrible risk.
We could destroy everything that
this experiment has led up to. We--
Experiment?
I am not some laboratory rat
you manipulate at will, Dr.  Hoffman.
I say there's no more time.
I say this night will end in my
first morning for 200 years.
I'd forgotten that the sky
could be so many colors.
When I close my eyes,
I can still see the light.
My hand.
It prickles
with stinging points of heat.
It is heat.
My blood is warming.
My hand is warming.
This hand that has been cold
for 200 years is warm.
I see the sun.
I see the sun.
Pull the drapes, Willie.
Leave it.
Willie. Pull the drapes.
Do not block my light!
- Willie!
- No!
Doc! Doc, somebody's at the frong door!
Help me, Willie.
Get rid of who it is, Willie.
Ok.
What do you want?
We're here to see Barnabas, Willie.
Well, it's awful early!
He's still asleep!
Willie, it's important.
I'd appreciate it if you'd get him.
Before he leaves for Boston or Portland.
It seems he's always away when
somebody wants to see him.
Particularly during the day.
- He is here, isn't he?
- Sure he's here.
Sure. Where--Where else would he be?
Willie, I'm afraid we're going
to have to ask you to wake him.
Now, may we come in?
Good morning.
Julia, what are you doing here?
Oh, Willie came to get
me early this morning.
And it's a good thing he did.
Barnabas is very ill.
Odd that Willie didn't tell us that.
He just said he was sleeping.
And he is.
He has a raging fever that kept
him awake the entire night.
Well, then perhaps we should, uh,
come back later and pay our respects.
I don't think that would be advisable.
Why, doctor? Does he have the plague?
Are you quarantining the house?
Michael, I don't understand the
nature of these questions.
Doctor,
we have to talk with Mr. Collins
regarding Daphne, and the others.
Are you suggesting he's a suspect?
Well, nobody's making any accusations.
We just want to have a brief conversation.
Now! This morning.
In the daylight.
George?
Um, I was hoping I
wouldn't have to use this.
I've got a warrant here
to search the premises.
Excuse me, doctor.
All right, Willie, take us to him.
Obviously, he's somewhere upstairs.
What are we waiting for?
That won't be necessary, gentlemen.
Mr. Collins!
I am the one who should be
surprised, Professor Woodard.
To discover 3 unexpected guests
in my house, at this early hour?
I don't remember issuing an invitation.
I'm sorry about this, Barnabas.
Professor Woodard
had a crazy idea
Roger. Roger.
I'd prefer to discuss crazy
ideas at another time.
As Dr. Hoffman may have informed you,
I'm not at all well.
Of course.
Again, please accept our apologies.
Michael, I must insist
we leave the house now.
Come on,  Michael.
Must let Mr. Collins get back to bed.
In a moment.
I'm sorry to see that you're ill, Mr.
Collins.
Did you ever think that
perhaps your problem might be
the need of more sunlight?
You do look awfully pale.
You may be right, Professor.
Alright, gentlemen. I'm sorry. That's
enough. My patient needs rest.
Michael, you will have to leave now.
Willie, take Mr. Collins to bed.
We're sorry about this, Mr. Collins.
If you need anything from
town, anything at all,
you have Loomis call.
I'll send one of the boys around with it.
Michael.
I'm warning you,
Michael.
If anything happens to Mr. Collins
as a result of this visit,
I going to hold you personally responsible.
I don't know what happened,
Julia, but I'll find out.
I don't understand you, Michael.
You've already seen your theory disproven.
Don't throw your life away, Julia.
He'll destroy you.
He destroys everything he touches.
Goodbyei, Michael.
You made me look like a damn
fool in there, Michael.
3 damn fools.
The facts haven't changed. The evidence
still points to Barnabas Collins.
What evidence? unless the eminent
professor wishes to alter his theory
to accommodate vampires who fly by day,
or some similar lunatic thought.
He's dangerous.
I'm sure of it.
Somehow he's tricked us.
Doctor Hoffman?
She's part of it too?
I don't want to hear any more.
Michael, you find hard
evidence, I'll listen.
Until then, you leave Mr. Collins alone.
Clear?
Yes, sheriff.
Ice
burns
so smooth,
so cool.
He should sleep until sundown.
Don't leave. Keep the room absolutely dark
and I want to know immediately
if there's any change.
Yeah, yeah.
Sure, doci.
Keep a sharp eye out for Michael Woodard.
If he shows up, call Sheriff Patterson, ok?
Yeah, I'll do that, doc.
And then when you get better,
 I'm going to take you fishing
and--and then we're gonna go....
we'll go white-water rafting.
Yeah, that'll be good.
And then, we'll get a car and
I'll--I'll teach you how to drive
'cause the doc's gonna have you
fixed up any day, Barnabas.
You're gonna be fine. Just fine. Any day.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
He's back! Uh, uh, it's alright, Barnabas.
 It's going to be alright.
Uh, I'll take care of everything.
Um, don't worry.
Don't worry.
You can count on old Willie-boy.
Uh, I'm gonna do just what the doc ordered.
Uh, I'm gonna do just what the doc ordered.
Auntie!
It's you! Oh, boy, am I glad it's you!
How very nice, Willie.
May I come in?
Sure! Why noti?
Oh, my!
This is lovely.
Oh, Willie.
You and Mr. Collins have done
wonders with this place.
Yeah. Not bad, huh, Auntie?
Oh, Willie.
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
This is beautiful.
What have you got there, Auntie?
Here. I brought your favorite.
Nut loaf?
This is great, Auntie.
Mmm. You want some?
Uh, no, you keep it, Willie,
but, uh, try not to dribble any
more crumbs on Mr. Collins' floor.
Oh, yeah.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
Interrupting?
No, Auntie. Like what?
Well, you've been so busy lately
with all your new responsibilities.
Oh, yeah. Yeah. I've been real busy.
And Barnabas says I'm
real important to him.
Barnabas says I'm his amanuensis.
What's that?
It's real important.
Well, I'm very proud of you, Willie.
Your father would be, too.
 God rest his soul.
You're making a real place
 for yourself in this world.
Yeah. I know.
Willie, what is wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing, Auntie. But, uh, like you said,
I'm real busy because I got...
I got a lot of
responsibilities around here.
So, uh, I'll tell you what, I
really appreciate your coming by,
and--and especially for bringing
nut loaf and everything.
You stop by for dinner soon.
You hear, Willie?
Sure thing, Auntie. You bet.
My Willie.
- Professor Woodard.
- Elizabeth.
Come in.
Uh, Sheriff Patterson was concerned
that you might blame him
for this morning's unfortunate
misunderstanding.
But I should tell you, it
was my fault, entirely.
You could have brought your
suspicions to me, Michael. / I know.
We might have looked into
them in a less public way
and saved the entire embarrassment.
Yes, I--I was hoping Dr.
Hoffman might at home
so that I could give her
my apologies as well.
I think you'll find her
by the lily pond, reading.
Would you like me to get her for you?
Oh, thank you. It's not necessary.
I'll find her.
Did you find her?
Uh, yes, thank you, uh, and
please accept my apologies again.
Apology accept, Michael. / Right.
Why don't we forget the whole
unpleasant affair?
Uh, that-that's very nice
of you, uh, thank you.
Julia!
Good evening,
Elizabeth.
The chill certainly comes quickly
here once the sun goes down.
Yes, some weather is moving in.
It was very gracious of Michael
to drop by and apologize.
Michael Woodard?
Why, yes. Didn't you see him?
How very odd.
I could have sworn he'd told
me you'd spoken.
I'm afraid the professor's been
acting a bit dotty recently.
Yes, I suppose we all have,
if the truth be known.
Yes, well, uh, now if you'll
excuse me, Elizabeth.
I have a mountain of work upstairs.
Michael,
you fool.
Then Woodard knows everything?
I had to keep a medical record, Barnabas.
All of my work.
The entire cure.
It would have been ill-advised not to.
Where are you going?
There's business to attend to.
Barnabas, at least let me talk to him.
I know I can make him understand.
Understand what, doctor?
Why you're trying to cure a vampire?
Well, let me try.
Willie!
And what would you say? That as
a result of your noble efforts,
I'm nearly a new man?
That the past is past
and that tomorrow shall be a
bright and shining new day?
Barnabas, I don't want
anything to happen to Michael.
You called, Barnabas?
Yes, Willie. Please escort Dr.
Hoffman to Collinwood.
Well, jeez, Barnabas.
You know, it's raining pretty
 good out there. / Now, Willie!
And take her directly to the house. /
Sure thing, Barnabas.
Ok, doc. Let's go.
Barnabas, please--
Good night, doctor.
Hurry. Come on, come on.
Hello?
This is Michael Woodard again.
Hasn't Sheriff Patterson called in yet?
Yes, I know there's a terrible storm,
But I--I told you. I must talk to him.
It's very important.
Hello? Hello? Hello!
Damn it.
Sebastian,that's not a good
thing to do to an old man.
Sebastian? Is that you?
You've made a serious mistake, professor.
You foolish curiousity
has now brought you into my bleak universe.
