Previously on Life Unexpected.
You and someone had a kid,
you gave up that kid. I'm that kid.
Cate Cassidy, that's your mom.
I'm Cate Cassidy.
Ryan and I've been up since 5.
And as usual, arguing
since six.
- What are you doing?
- Will you marry me?
You've met the qualifications
as foster parents
and will be granted temporary
joint custody of Lux.
Sleeping with Baze again, it was
the biggest mistake of my life.
When did you sleep
with Baze again?
This relationship- it's over.
No, Ryan.
Ryan!
That family wants me.
They're three hours away.
I need you to take Tasha.
To live with us.
Lux, I can't.
This is the only thing
I'll ever ask you.
I'm sorry.
Me, too.
Hey, you in here?
Seriously?
Lux, I can explain.
For once we're not talking
about sex.
We are talking
about sleeping together.
"Sleeping" being
the operative word.
<i>Sometimes it can be
incredibly romantic</i>
<i>to share a bed
with someone you love.</i>
<i>"Can" being the other
operative word.</i>
<i>Actual quality of sleep
can be totally downgraded.</i>
<i>That's true; that's very true,
but what about the guilt?</i>
<i>What guilt?</i>
<i>Well, you know,
every time you move,</i>
<i>your partner views it
as a personal assault</i>
<i>on her REM state.</i>
<i>It's true.</i>
<i>But sometimes you just wish
they'd disappear</i>
<i>so you can have your bed back
and rest in peace.</i>
Okay, so we have Nancy
from Richmond on the line.
Nancy, why are
you losing sleep?
My new boyfriend is a kicker.
Is that awful?
No, it worked fo
Ozzie and Harriet.
Yeah, you remember that episode
where Ozzie and Harriet
have spontaneous morning sex?
No.
Exactly.
Look, Cate, besides,
if we sleep in separate beds
you're not going to be able
to rub your ice cube feet
all over my legs.
I started wearing socks.
And maybe I don't
have cold feet
Maybe you have hot legs.
Anyway, opped
putting my feet on you
a few weeks ago, in case
you hadn't noticed.
Yeah, I noticed.
You know, the funny thing is,
sometimes I wake up
having dreamt that your feet
are still on me
when they're not.
You dream about my feet?
Like once.
Mm, last night was
pretty mind-blowing.
You're telling me.
I don't think I've ever
had a foot cramp
that seized my
lower back before.
Hey, you want some breakfast?
I'm gonna make
some for Lux.
No. I think she's
already up and gone.
I didn't see her when
I went to get water.
Oh, just for
five more minutes.
Nice try.
It took me an hour to
escape your vise grip.
What can I say?
I missed you.
The next time you leave town-
I am implanting
a GPS chip in you.
I bet Baze would love to
get a tracking system on you.
Well, there are benefits
to my bedroom walls
being shower curtains.
He's too weirded out
to open them.
He's also too busy
sleeping with Cate's sister
to notice anything.
So, what are you up to today?
I don't know.
Being back means I've got
to find a way to pay rent.
Which means I got to get a job.
Like a legit job?
I actually got a gig tonight.
Really?
Yeah, it's 50 bucks
to pass out fliers
at some cheesy nightclub.
It's lame, I know,
but I want to do
this for you.
No, it's not lame.
It's so not lame.
I'll come with you.
Well, ifou're
doing this for me,
the least I can do
is be there for you.
Hey, you.
I zapped up some
tempeh-tofu dogs for you,
but are they supposed
to smell like
a hippie's armpit?
'Cause they do.
So does Abby's
patchouli perfume.
Ah, is that what this cold
shoulder's all about?
You are sneaking around
behind Cate's back
with her sister,
being a giant sex hypocrite.
You bribed a guyo date me,
and waved a condom in his face
that wasn't even his.
It's more than
a cold shoulder.
It's... a cold whole body.
Okay, I know I made
some mistakes.
I shouldn't have butted
into your dating life for one.
I don't have a dating life.
I'm with Bug.
Okay, about that-
I- I don't think
that guy's good for you.
He's a delinquent
and a parasite.
Remember when you weren't going
to butt into my dating life?
Fine, fine, consider
my butt out of it.
I just... Just tell me
what can I do to fix
things between us?
Stop seeing Abby.
Fine.
How about no Abby,
no Bug?
Deal?
Whatever.
I'm, uh, I'm glad
we had this talk.
Hello.
Yes, this is she.
Yes, she's my daughter.
Oh, my God!
Yeah, I'll be right there.
A curfew violation?
What is this, wartime Germany?
The law is intended to ensure
that parents know
where their children
are at all times.
And I'm guessing
you didn't know
Lux was distributing flyers
outside a nightclub at 1:00 A.M.
Of course I didn't.
I thought Ferris Bueller
here was at home in bed.
I was trying to help Bug
with his job,
which he lost because of me.
Okay, what happened
to no Bug?
I never agreed to anything.
Would you agree that
this is the second time that
I've been to this police station
because of that kid?
Okay, Lux is living with you.
It is your responsibility
to keep track of her.
Being as you share custody,
it's just as much
your responsibility.
Unless you're saying you two
are no longer sharing custody.
Well, I'm just staying
at Baze's for a bit.
Mm-hmm, she's mad at me
because of this little
thing with her friend.
Tasha's not some "little thing."
If you would have taken her in,
she wouldn't be three hours away
living with a family
that she hates.
So, you two had a fight,
Lux moved outand you ft
the change in
custody arrangements?
And you're failing to set
boundaries or keep tabs
on Lux's whereabouts.
As you know,
your family evaluation
is scheduled for next month.
Yes, and this will
all be straightened out
by then, I promise.
Cate, from where I'm standing-
which is in a police station
in the middle of the night-
this situation seems a little
past straightening out.
I'm moving up your evaluation.
Be in my office Monday,
9:00 A.M.
What exactly will
you be evaluating?
She needs guardians she respects
who can keep her under control.
What do you mean
she needs guardians?
We're her parents.
This arrangement was temporary.
So, if you two
can't control Lux,
we need to find people who can.
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com
Okay, we can get through this.
Yes, we have problems,
but, I mean, it's nothing
that we can't work out.
I've been to these evaluations
plenty of times.
Once it gets to this,
the chances of staying
together aren't that great.
This isn't going to be
like other times, Lux.
Unless...
Do you want it to be?
Well, I don't want to go back
to foster care,
if that's what you mean.
Good.
So then things need to change.
Exactly.
But how do we fix things
before Monday?
Well, forgiving me for Tasha,
that would be a good start.
And maybe living
by my rules?
You don't even live
by your rules.
You guys say that I have
to change for this evaluation.
Well, what about the two of you?
Cashier needs
a high school diploma.
Busboy: Experience required.
Window-washer:
Must bring his own tools.
What, like a squeegee?
I'm never gonna get a job
and my rent's due in a week.
No, you'll find something.
I know it.
How?
I don't have experience
or education.
I don't even have a squeegee.
Yove a me.
Don't tell Baze that.
Dude hates me.
Don't worry about Baze.
Aren't you?
You worried about this
evaluation thing or what?
Kind of.
A lot.
I don't want to be taken away.
But I can't help feeling
the way that I feel either.
Hi, I'm sorry to just
show up here.
What are you doing here?
Well, I know how upset
you've been with me about Tasha.
And I know that I couldn't
help her, but I thought
maybe I could help you.
I know that you need a job
and I've got one for you.
Are you serious?
It's at the station.
And it's yours iu want it.
You know, it's logging tapes,
answering phones.
You can interview later
today. Are you sure?
I'm the star of the show.
I've got pull.
So, let me get this straight.
You don't have a resume?
Uh, no, ma'am.
And you didn't graduate
high school?
No, ma'am, but I plan
on getting my GED.
As soon as I get a job.
Kind of a catch-22 there.
So...
this is the extent
of your experience.
Uh, no. I've had other jobs.
You know,
here and there.
But I learn quick.
Oh. Okay, Bobby.
Thank you for coming in.
Thanks.
Okay.
Take care.
Okay, so he's no
perfect. He's polite.
I hate being
called "ma'am."
I will have him
call you "mister."
Come on, Alice.
Look, even if I wanted
to hire him, which I don't,
the company doesn't
let us hire people
without a high school diploma.
Come on. The show is called
<i>Morning Madness
with Cate and Ryan.</i>
I'm Cate.
Doesn't that mean anything?
Lately, no.
All right, come on.
Look, Alice, please?
I have already tanked
things with Ryan.
I just need...
The Ryan problem would
be easier to deal with.
The man admitted that he
still dreams about your feet.
Barely
Whatever. It means he
still feels something.
It doesn't mean
he wants me back.
I mean, what
am I supposed to do?
I practically begged him at that
stupid contest not to do this.
I made it completely obvious
at the dumb Expo
that want to be with him.
Ryan doesn't want
to get back together with me
unless I change, but look at me.
Look at my life. Here I am,
trying to get my daughter's
boyfriend named Bug a job.
How much more can I change?
Yeah, about that.
Should I tell you now or later
that the job thing is
not going to happen?
Listen to me, Alice.
I will do anything.
I cannot let her down again.
Cate, I'm sorry.
<i>What happened to</i>
"It's yours if you want it"?
I know and
I feel terrible.
It's okay.
You tried.
I'm sorry if
I got your hopes up.
If you got his hopes up?
You said to trust you,
that the job was his.
Lux, I am sorry.
I'm the one who's sorry.
For being stupid enough
to believe you'd
actually come through.
Hey. You wanted
to talk to me?
Hey, Abby, yeah.
Yeah, thanks for coming down.
I, uh, I got
deliveries.
Jamie's gone.
I couldn't leave.
But I want to talk to you...
um, about Lux.
Oh, yeah. I just heard.
Cate told me.
What? Wait, you didn't talk
to Cate about us, did you?
Are you crazy?
She'd inflict worse damage
than a shark attack.
No, she left me a message
about the whole...
custody evaluation.
Speaking of which, uh...
I want to talk about that.
You wanna...?
Ooh, um, yeah.
A vodka martini, extra dirty,
extra olives. That'd be great.
Um, I meant "sit."
Take it from me.
This evaluation
isn't going to be easy.
Social workers
are a tougnch.
They're bitter
parakeet-owning feministas.
And if you and Lux are
having trouble, she'll know.
I picked her up
from a police station.
I think that "troubles"
is putting it mildly.
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,
Cate's not having
any luckther.
She just tried to hire Bug
to make Lux happy,
and it just blew up
in her face.
You want to hire Bug?
Sure. The bar's getting busy.
I've been short-handed.
It'd be a favor to me.
I mean, it's late hours
and it's hard work,
but if you're up for it...
Hell, yeah, I'll take the job.
When do I start?
How about now?
Uh, grab some limesout of the s.
It's downstairs.
You'll find it.
Why are you doing this?
He's a good kid.
Really?
'Cause yesterday, you called
him a delinquent parasite.
Okay, look
You and I didn't get off
on the right foot
with this whole parenting thing.
But if Bug is
important to you,
then he's important to me.
What's the catch?
No catch.
But in order for this
to work with me and Bug,
it's got to work
between you and me.
You got to play
by the rules.
So no sleeping at Bug's,
no sneaking out.
So that when
we meet with Fern,
she won't be able
to ding us on anything.
We'll be cool, right?
Yeah.
We're cool.
Hey, Bug.
When you're done here,
can you refill
the soda canisters?
I did it already.
That's great. You can start
tidying up the bar supplies.
Already done.
Wow. You overachieve much?
I just want to do a
good job, you know?
I just really appreciate
this chance, Baze.
So, thanks.
Yeah.
Oh, crap.
Abby. Hey.
I forgot that you were here.
That's okay. I was
just waiting to talk.
Although, you know,
it would be fun
to go someplace
and not talk.
Ah. Believe me,
I would love to,
multiple times,
but I can't.
I can't do this.
This... fling,
or whatever it is.
Because I'm not being
a good example for Lux.
So I can't see you anymore,
Abby.
Whoa. Are you okay?
No!
No. You are such a great guy
that you're making
my ovaries hurt.
Hello?
I need your help as a therapist.
Narcissistic borderline
personality disorder.
That's what you have.
I meant with Lux.
She won't listen to a word I say
because of this Tasha thing.
I thought it was a Bug thing.
Yeah, whatever. I'm on a roll.
I mean, do you think
you can help me?
Because I got
to fix things by Monday.
Whatever you need.
Oh, great.
Uh, meet me at Baze's
above Open Bar.
That's where she is.
Do you need the address?
You know, I think I can find it.
You can relax
with the death stare.
Nobody's forcing you
to be here.
Good. 'Cause Bug's
in the bar.
What's Bug doing
in the bar?
Baze hired him.
That's what.
Are you serious?
Lux?
Lux.
You seem to have a lot
of anger and hostility
towards Cate.
And frankly,
who can blame you?
But you need
to understand
where Cate was coming from
with this whole Tasha thing.
This Fern chick
barely thinks that she's
capable of keeping you.
You think that she would
have let Cate have Tasha?
That's not the point.
The point is,
is that I asked you
and you wouldn't even try.
Okay, well, then
what are the rules, Lux?
Because I tried
with Bug.
I tried to hire him
before Baze did.
Yet, somehow he's the hero
and I suck.
Can we be done now?
I can't believe
I'm going to say this.
But for once,
you're not the
problem here.
This is not about
Tasha or Bug.
HonEstly.
This is about Lux.
Cate? Abby. Hey.
Uh, long time no see.
Yeah.
It's been, what,
since dinner at
your parents', I think.
Definitely.
I- I definitely
have not seen you since then.
Didn't she helyou
with the sex talk?
Lux?
Oh.
Yeah. That's right.
That's, um,
it was awkward.
Blocked that out.
So, um...
What's up?
You hired Bug.
That's what's up.
That was my way
of fixing things and...
So what?
So what?
Now you're rubbing
it in my face?
I'm not rubbing anything.
You tried, I tried.
That's the point, right?
I mean,
who cares who helps Bug?
Who even cares about Bug?
Guys.
Just came to see
if you needed help
Who even cares?
Hey.
Bug, wait.
Wait. Bug?
What is the matter with you?
Cate screws him over
and you stomp on whatever
self-worth he had left?
Listen, Cate and I, we just want
to make things right.
We cannot fail
this evaluation.
Don't you get it?
Neither of you
cAn make it right.
The most consistent thinu
two do is make things worse.
Okay, here's
the deal.
We just have to go in there
and present a united front.
We want Lux,
and she wants us.
What if that doesn't work?
Okay. Well, then we
only have one choice.
Lie. Lie. Lie.
So, last I saw you,
things were a bit
out of control.
How have the past few days been?
Good, good. Uh, yeah, we're
just smoothing out the kinks.
What kind of kinks?
Have you met Bug?
Last night, Baze helped me
with my homework.
Who knew he was so adept
at fractions?
Last night, I took Lux
to see a stage play.
<i>Of Billy Elliott.</i>
I thought it had
an uplifting theme.
Lots of dancing.
Last night, we partied
on Rock Band for hours.
I mean, up until her bed time
which is a strictly-enforced
hard 10:00.
No snacking after 9:00.
Do you... do you Rock Band?
So, you think things
are working great as they are?
Without question.
Hells to the yeah.
Mm-hmm.
In all of my years
of social work,
I have never seen such
a pathetic charade.
You would rather lie
about your problems
than confront
or solve them.
And if that's the case,
I have no other choice
but to find Lux
another placement.
It was my fault.
Lux.
It wasn't.
It was ours.
Cate and I. We were afraid
to tell you the truth
because we didn't think
you'd let us keep her.
And what is the truth?
In short...
we suck.
But not for lack
of trying.
I don't know if this is
about Tasha or not anymore.
But I tried to make it up
to you with Bug. I did.
Tasha and Bug aren't
like other kids.
They don't have parents
to support them.
When they need help,
they turn to me.
And you made me feel
likE I could turn to you,
but you weren't there for me.
For you?
You mean for your friends.
Yeah, my friends.
But you said "me."
You said Cate
wasn't there for you.
Yeah, she wasn't.
I asked her the favor.
So yeah, she wasn't
there for me.
That's what this i
really about, right?
Cate not being there.
I say yes and what?
You send me away to live
with someone else?
I don't want to live
with someone else.
I want to work it out
with Cate and Baze.
I just...
Look, I'm the one
who's going to decide
if you stay together.
But ultimately,
it's not up to me.
It's up to you.
If you can't be
straight with me,
you're never gonna
be straight
with Cate and Baze
and then you'll be right back
on my couch six months from now.
So when you say that Cate
wasn't there for you,
tell her what you mean.
Where were you?
What?
I was out there my whole life.
Where were you all that time?
You never even checked.
You never wondered
what had happened?
If I waskay?
I didn't really think
that I had to worry.
You know, because they told me
that you were gonna be adopted.
That you were gonna
have a better life.
I really, I really thought
that I was doing
what was right for you.
It wasn't for me.
If it was for me,
you would have checked.
No, you did it for you.
You did the right thing for you.
Lux, it's not all on Cate.
I wasn't there exactly, either.
Yeah, but you didn't know.
And no one who knew you
would have expected
you to be there.
I was 16 years old.
I didn't have anyone
to turn to.
You know, my mother,
she was drinking her way
through another divorce.
I even wrote a letter
to my father,
but when I realized that
dn't know where to send it,
you know, that's when it hit me.
I had no idea
what a good parent was.
There was just no way
that I could be one, not at 16.
Then what about
a few years after that?
When I was three and stuck in
a hospital where no one visited?
Or two years after that
when my foster mom
shoved me into a wall
and told the social worker
that I fell off a swing.
Where were you?
We used to make up these stories
about why we were given up.
Because we didn't want to
believe that our parents,
our mothers could hold us,
their babies,
and just give us up.
But you did.
You gave me away to nothing,
like I didn't matter to you
because I didn't.
No, no, Lux, you do.
You matter now.
No, Lux,
you matter, you do,
you matter now, Lux.
No, now it doesn't count.
I- I'm sorry.
I don't forgive you, Cate.
I don't.
I know it doesn't
feel like it,
but what you had today
was a breakthrough.
Trust me,
I've seen other kids
have moments of
honesty like this,
and that's usually when things
take turn for the better.
I know that you tried
to shoulder the blame,
but it doesn't
belong with you.
I'm not going to remove Lux
from your care.
If anything,
this shows me
that you're a real family,
with all the bumps and bruises
that a teenager brings,
like anyone.
And as far as I'm concerned,
you twould start the process
of having your parental rights
reinstated.
Really?
Is there really
a chance of that
In my opinion, yes.
and that all three of you are
committed to making this work,
maybe Lux most of all.
That was a hard thing
she did, saying that.
She risked losing you
all over again.
She never has to worry
about that. Ever.
You don't have to convince me.
Convince Lux.
Lux, you there?
Can we talk?
I'm gonna put an envelope
under the door.
Just... take a look, okay?
♪ And I feel lost ♪
♪ Lost like I've
never been before ♪
♪ ♪
♪...and my dreams
are gone and buried ♪
♪ My eyes are shredding tears
and I've been... ♪
Hey.
What's wrong?
I need your help.
You know, Lux says
that she can't forgive me
for giving her up.
And I can't really get through.
Neither can Baze.
And so I was thinking, you know,
as another person
that can't forgive me
that maybe, um, you
could talk to her.
You can't keep coming to me
like this.
Yeah, I know.
Um... I'm sorry.
I know it's not fair.
Well, can I at least
just tell you something?
I never told anyone this before.
I never held Lux
after she was born.
You know, the nurses,
they wanted me to.
They kept bringing her in
to me, but...
I knew that if I held hEr,
I'd want her.
And I couldn't let myself.
So I pushed her away.
And I have done that
my entire life...
with everyone.
Until recently.
I mean, Ryan, I know that
you say that I have to change,
<i>but what you don't realize
is that I have changed.</i>
I mean, I started to change
the momEnt that Lux
came back into my life,
because for the first
time in my life,
I saw a possibility.
You know, for the rst time
in my life I saw...
I saw a dream that
I wasn't afraid to want.
And I'm not saying
that I changed overnight,
it has been slow, and I
have made a lot of mistakes.
I know that I lied to yo.
I know that that was wrong.
It was beyonong.
But at the time,
I thought I had to
or I would lose you.
And it wasn't just
about losing you.
It was about
losing the person
that I was Becoming with you.
And Lux.
I wanted to be a family.
You know, but so much
has happened.
I don't expect you to
understand or forgive me.
But will you at least
just help me?
Lux isn't here.
She went for a walk.
On a scale of one to ten,
how pissed is Lux at me?
Can you blame her?
In case you can't tell,
I'm often in a race with myself
for jackass of the year.
Well, you won. Congratulations.
Listen...
I'm sorry.
What you heard, I just...
Okay, you're probably not gonna
believe a word I say, but...
I see a lot of potential in you.
You're a lot like me,
minus the whole neck situation.
So, I might have hired you
for the wrong reasons,
but I'd like to keep you on
for the right ones.
So...
Job's still yours.
If you want it.
Just think about it.
I thoughtI'd find you here.
This your thinking spot?
Guess I've had a lot
of thinking to do lately.
Yeah, I know the feeling.
Whatcha got there?
Court papers.
Cate and Baze signed them.
To legally adopt me...
when I'm ready.
But you're not?
Why not?
'Cause I think it's more
than just not forgiving Cate.
You and Cate are
so much alike.
It's crazy.
You're both scared
to really want tngs.
Scared if you do,
it'll hurt too much
if you don't get them,
or they disappear.
Cate's not going anywhere.
And these court papers prove it.
She's changed, Lux, and you're
the one who changed her.
You don't really believe that.
Yeah, I do.
Then I don't get it.
You come here and find me
to tell me that,
that Cate's changed, that I
should give her another chance.
But if you really believe
that that's true,
then why can't you?
Can I talk to you?
Of course.
Wrap up. It's cold.
Ooh.
So, I've been doing
some thinking.
You, me,
this.
Yeah?
Before I moved in,
we had churro contests
and YouTube marathons.
Mmm.
The ketchup-eating competition.
Ah, that wasn't really
a contest.
Math is a human siphon.
But lately it's been
less ketchup-eating
and more fighting,
and I don't like it.
I don't want to fight with you.
Yeah, and I don't either.
I want to go back.
All this trying-to-be-a-dad
stuff has gotten in the way.
I want to go back
to being just friends.
It, um...
it doesn't work like that.
I can't just flip a switch
and go back.
You could be my friend,
it's fine,
but I am never going to stop
trying to be your dad.
♪ I just want to go away
with you. ♪
Hey.
Hi.
I'm, I'm sorry to bother you
so late.
I just... I don't know.
I need someone to talk to.
What's wrong?
My own kid just broke up
with me.
Hey...
this is just the beginning.
You think it happens overnight?
ople spend
their entire lives
learning to be parents
and they still screw
their kids up.
I mean,
look at me.
I'm a therapist
who still lives with my mom.
Ouch.
Do you want to come inside?
She and her
box of wine are already in bed.
I probably shouldn't.
I mean, you and me,
it's probably not a good idea,
gaven everything.
Baze, this doesn't have
to be just a fling.
Crazy idea, but
maybe if you show Lux
that it's more,
she'll see it differently.
You should be a therapist
or something.
You give really good advice.
Well, that'll be
a hundred bucks.
How about, um...
we go out tomorrow?
Dinner, maybe.
I mean, you do, you
like dinner, right?
What's not to like?
It's gonna work out with Lux.
You'll see.
Come in!
Hey.
I was just thinking
about you.
Yeah?
Yeah, well, I mean,
I was thinking
about your hot legs
and my cold feet.
Why is it so hard
to keep a pair
of socks together?
The missing one
usually turns up.
Sometimes it just takes
someone else to find it.
Hi.
Here's the thing:
I can't promise
that this is gonna work
or that I won't
get upset
and I won't take it
out on you.
I know I seem like I'm okay,
but I'm more messed up inside
than you realize.
And the truth is,
I don't forgive you.
I don't know when I'll ever
be able to forgive you.
Lux, you don't have to.
You don't ever have
to forgive me.
I'm never gonna be able
to forgive me.
I just want a chance
to make it right with you.
Please tell me whaI have to do
to make it right.
Let me come home.
(both sob softly
♪ Late in the night, I'm gonna
head right over to you ♪
♪ I'm gonna head
right over to you ♪
♪ And try and love you... ♪
I, uh, restocked the liquor
and polished off
the last of the peanuts.
I was starving.
I wasn't sure how
to order more.
I could... I could show you
if you want.
Hey, um,
Lux said something
about your dad.
He in the picture?
Unless the picture's prison, no.
Make you a deal.
Since you don't have a dad
and I need to learn
how to be one,
uh, maybe you can give me
some practice.
♪ I'll say it slowly ♪
♪ I'm gonna head
right over to you ♪
Well?
Um, well, she's unpacking.
I can't believe it.
I never thought I'd be so happy
to see a bong lamp.
How'd you do it?
What'd you say?
The truth.
And I know that earlier,
you, uh, you did, too.
Look, I-I don't like
being lied to and I don't like
being played.
I know, Ryan, I know.
I mean it would be hard
for anyone
to put themselves in your shoes
that day,
the day Lux came back.
That day was...
it was life-changing.
And where you and I were
or weren't,
it's not an excuse
for what you did.
I'm just saying...
I wasn't in your shoes.
<i>And you were right
you were changing.</i>
You didn't lie
because you hadn't changed.
You lied because you had.
I just want to do
the right thing, you know?
Take my own advice.
I want to be able
to forgive you, Cate.
And I want to be there
for Lux.
I know, but you can't.
Ryan, I only wante
to be a person
that's worthy of you.
I still do,
whether or not we're together.
I can'ank you enough
for everythivg.
Kicking me out now or what?
No, of course not.
'Cause I could stay.
I- I could help you find
that missing sock
'cause I really don't want
to deal with your cold feet
tonight.
Really?
Come here.
Your mom, too.
