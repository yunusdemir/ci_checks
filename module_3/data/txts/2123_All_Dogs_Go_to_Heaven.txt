IT'S A SPECTACULAR LINE-UP
WITH MIGHTY MORRIS
TAKING AN EARLY LEAD.
RAT O' WAR IS SECOND
BY A HEAD,
AND SECRETARY RAT TRAILS
BY A HALF.
WHAT AN AMAZING RACE,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
OUT OF THE TURN,
IT'S MIGHTY MORRIS,
WITH RAT O' WAR
CHARGING UP FROM BEHIND.
IN THE SECOND TURN,
MIGHTY MORRIS AND RAT O' WAR
FIGHT IT OUT
WHILE SQUAD CAR
TRAILS THE PACK.
NOW IT'S RAT O' WAR
BY A NOSE.
SECRETARY RAT IS SECOND
BY A HEAD,
WITH MIGHTY MORRIS
BACK AT THIRD--BUT WAIT.
SQUAD CAR IS MAKING HIS MOVE
IN THE REAR.
HE TRIES TO THE RIGHT.
HE TRIES TO THE LEFT.
BUT IT'S NO GOOD, FOLKS.
IT'S RAT-EAT-RAT OUT THERE,
AND THEY'RE JUST NOT
GONNA LET HIM THROUGH.
BUT WHAT'S THIS? SQUAD CAR'S
COMING THROUGH THE MIDDLE.
OH! HE'S CAUGHT IN A PINCH!
OH, MY GOSH! BUT NOW
HE'S CLIMBING OUT,
AND HE'S RIDING
ON TOP OF CHEEZEWHIZ!
AND INTO THE LOOP-THE-LOOP,
IT'S SQUAD CAR ON CHEEZEWHIZ
BRINGING UP THE REAR AS

SQUAD CAR PLAYING HOPSCOTCH
IN THE BACK STRETCH.
SIXTH! FIFTH! FOURTH!

I DON'T BELIEVE IT!
INTO THE OBSTACLE,
SQUAD CAR TAKES THE LEAD!
SO IT'S SQUAD CAR
BY A LENGTH,
RAT O' WAR SECOND BY A HEAD,
CHEEZEWHIZ MOVING INTO THIRD.
BUT WAIT A MINUTE!
HE'S...HE'S...HE'S...
HE'S STUCK! SQUAD CAR IS STUCK.
WHAT A NIGHTMARE!
IT'S SQUAD CAR BY A TAIL.
OH, MY GOSH!
LOOK OUT!
WHAT'S THIS?
IT'S SQUAD CAR
SPRINGING TO THE FINISH!
WHAT AN INCREDIBLE RACE!
SQUAD CAR, RAT RACE'S
SHORTEST LONG SHOT,

ABOUT THIS.
WE SET HIM UP FOR GOOD.
KILLER,
I DO NOT WISH
THAT I SHOULD SHARE
50% OF THE BUSINESS
WITH MY PARTNER CHARLIE.
YOU WANT
THAT I SHOULD GO
SQUEEZE HIS HEAD
WITH THE PLIERS?
KILLER, THAT IS NO WAY
TO TREAT AN OLD FRIEND.
FRIENDS MUST BE HANDLED
IN A FRIENDLY
AND BUSINESSLIKE WAY.
CARFACE!

THIS PLACE
IS LOOKING OK--
A LITTLE GAUCHE,
BUT OK.
YOU KNOW, PARTNER,
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
BUT THE CUSTOMERS
AIN'T LAUGHIN'.
GAMBLERS ARE NEVER
HAPPY, CHARLIE.
YOU KNOW THAT.
YEAH, BUT I'VE BEEN
THINKING.
WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS,
BESIDES NEW CURTAINS,
IS SOME CLASS,
CULTURE, CHOREOGRAPHY,
AND SOME INFLUENCE
OF THE THEATER.
DANCING GIRLS.
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
CHARLIE, TIMES HAS CHANGED.
I'VE CHANGED, YOU'VE CHANGED.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?
I HAVEN'T CHANGED.
CHARLIE, YOU DONE TIME.
THAT'S NOT GOOD
FOR BUSINESS.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
YOU ARE A DOG
WITH A RECORD.
I WAS FRAMED!
I KNOW. YOU'RE LIKE
A BROTHER TO ME.
THAT'S WHY...WHY...
WHY WHAT?
WE NEED TO SPLIT UP
THE PARTNERSHIP.
WHAT? ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?
THEY'LL BE LOOKING
FOR YOU,
AND WHAT'S THE FIRST PLACE
THEY'RE GONNA LOOK?
HERE. HERE!
I DON'T LIKE IT,
CHARLIE,
BUT IT'S
FOR OUR OWN GOOD.
DID IT EAT YET?
YEAH, IT ATE,
BUT HOW COME
I GOT TO FEED
CARFACE'S
LITTLE MONSTER?
Huh! Monster!
COME ON, DOGS,
YOU'VE GOT A JOB TO DO.
CARFACE WANTS YOU SHOULD
GET RID OF CHARLIE.
CHARLIE?
OH. OH! OOH! AH!
CHARLIE!
THEY'RE GOING TO
KILL YOU, CHARLIE!
CHARLIE!
WE'LL SET YOU UP

CHARLIE, TAKE IT.
YOU WANT A CUT
OF THE STEAKS?
T-BONES?

Carface:
BOYS, LISTEN UP!
MY FORMER PARTNER

DON'T GO WITHOUT MY
ROLLS-ROYCE HOOD ORNAMENT.
I'M NOT DEAD.
PLEASE, I GOT
A BAD BACK.
QUIET!
ITCHY, I'M NOT A GHOST.
I'M NOT DEAD.
NOW, BE QUIET.
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY HAND
AWAY FROM YOUR MOUTH,
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE QUIET,
AREN'T YOU?
HA HA!
THAT'S MY PAL.
AAHH!
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
ITCHY, I'M ALIVE!
LOOK.
DO GHOSTS HAVE FLEAS?
NO. GHOSTS
DON'T HAVE FLEAS.
RIGHT.
CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
IT'S REALLY YOU.
BUT I SAW THE CAR
AND THE RIVER...
I KNOW.
AND YOUR LIFELESS BODY
FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.
ITCHY, WHAT CAN I SAY?
IT WASN'T MY TIME.
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, CHARLIE!
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH I MISSED YOU!
SHUT UP!
YOU WANT THE WHOLE WORLD
TO KNOW I'M BACK?
YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD.
SO WILL CARFACE.
HE TRIED TO KILL ME.
I'LL MAKE HIM PAY!
WE DON'T WANT TO
DO THAT.
WE DO. I WAS
THE BRAINS OF THE OUTFIT.
WHEN I LEFT,
HE SHOULD HAVE GONE UNDER.
THAT'S IT, BOSS.
WE'LL GO UNDER.
DEEP, DEEP UNDER.
I DON'T WANT TO GO UNDER.
THE OPERATION GREW.
IT GOT BIGGER.
NOW HE WON'T SHARE.
WE COULD SHARE
A NICE LITTLE PLACE
IN THE HIMALAYAS.
I HATE THE HIMALAYAS.
WAIT. THEY GOT
GAMBLING, RACES.
WELL, THEY EVEN GOT
A TOWN CALLED TIBET.
YOU KNOW, TO-BET.
WE COULD NAB LLAMAS,
MOUNTAIN GOATS,
OPEN OUR OWN TRACK, BOSS.
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
UP HIS SLEEVE.
YEAH, A GUN.
WHEN I FIND OUT
WHAT IT IS,
I'M GONNA RUIN HIM.
I'M GONNA MAKE HIM
SUFFER...SLOW.
HE'LL BE BEGGING
FOR MERCY.
I'M BEGGING THAT
WE GET OUT OF HERE.
BOSS,
CARFACE HAS GOT THUGS,
AND THEY GOT MUSCLES,
KNIVES.
AND HE'S GOT A MONSTER
IN HIS BASEMENT.
WHAT?
BOSS, THEY FEED IT!
MONSTER?
YEAH, MONSTER!
I SAID MONSTER!
MONSTER?
HMM. HA HA!
HMM. HA HA!
CHARLIE, I JUST KNOW
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO DIE.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Now, let me see here.
Now, let me see here.
Stop it! Stop it!
Will you quit that?
I've had it
with your itching.
OH.
Hey, look,
look, look, look!
See...see...
the monster?
the monster?
OK. NOW
LET'S GO HOME.
WHO KNOWS
WHAT IT EATS?
AHH! YAH!
SOMEBODY'S GOT ME--
I GOT YOU
BY THE TAIL!
WHY DON'T YOU TELL SOMEBODY
YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT?
IT'S NOT WORTH IT
BEING WITH YOU.
YOUR HANDS
ARE COLD, TOO.
THERE. THERE.
NOW, THERE
IS YOUR MONSTER.
NOW, THERE
IS YOUR MONSTER.
WELL, I'LL BE!
WELL, I'LL BE!
AHH!
AHH!
MR. CARFACE, CAN I
GO OUTSIDE TODAY?
SURE YOU CAN,
LITTLE GIRL,
BUT FIRST
YOU TALK TO THE RAT.
WELL, IF YOU WANT
MY OPINION, BOSS,
I THINK MIGHTY MORRIS
IS GOING TO WIN THE RACE.
OH, BOSS! THAT CIGAR!
HI, MR. LONGTAIL.
HOW ARE YOU TODAY?
FINE, THANK YOU.
WILL YOU BE
IN THE RACE TONIGHT?
A SORE FOOT?
YOU SHOULDN'T RUN.
AND TWIZZLE
HAS A COLD?
SHE SHOULD
DRINK SOUP.
OH, SQUAD CAR
HAS THE FLU.
HURRY IT UP.
HURRY IT UP!
I'm sorry.
SO WHO DO YOU
THINK WILL WIN?
OH, I SEE.
THE SPOTTED GRAY.
KILLER!
UH-HUH.
SHIFT THE ODDS
ON THE SPOTTED GRAY
AND FEED THE KID.
OH, BOSS,
DO I HAVE TO?
OH, BOY. WHERE DID YOU
BUY THAT THING?
BUT, MR. CARFACE, YOU SAID
I COULD GO OUTSIDE TODAY.
CHARLIE?
A LITTLE GIRL
WHO TALKS TO ANIMALS.
IMAGINE THAT.
BOSS,
I THINK WE--
DON'T.
I'LL DO THE THINKING.
BUT, BOSS!
POOR CHILD.
WE'LL KIDNAP HER.
KIDNAP?
UH, RESCUE HER.
BUT, BOSS--
ITCHY, BUTTON IT UP.
UH, LITTLE GIRL!
EXCUSE ME.
WE UNDERSTAND YOU'RE BEING
HELD HERE AGAINST YOUR WILL.
LET ME INTRODUCE
MYSELF. SIT.
I AM
CHARLIE B. BARKIN,
AND THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE,
ITCHIFORD "ITCHY" DACHSHUND.
HOW DO YOU DO?
AND IT STRIKES ME THAT
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR YOU.
AM I RIGHT?
OH, WELL...
LET US TAKE YOU
AWAY FROM ALL THIS.
WHERE ARE YOUR PARENTS?
I'M AN ORPHAN.
AHH! SHE'S AN ORPHAN.
SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY PARENTS.
THAT SETTLES IT.
YOU'RE GOING TO
STAY WITH ITCHY.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
NO, NO, BOSS.
SHE CAN'T
STAY WITH ME.
THIS HAS GONE
TOO FAR.
I'M GETTIN'
OUTTA HERE.
YOU HAVE NO COMPASSION.
UHH!
STAY WITH ME.
ANNE-MARIE.
HUH?
YOU ASKED MY NAME.
IT'S ANNE-MARIE.
LISTEN, YOU'D LIKE LIVING
WITH ME, WOULDN'T YOU?
YOU'RE GOING TO
LOVE MY PLACE--
CANOPY BED UNDER THE STARS,
OPEN HEARTH,
3 SQUARE MEALS A DAY,
RADIO, HEATER, WHITEWALLS.
I LIVE IN A CAB.
LOW MILEAGE, OF COURSE.
HA HA HA HA!
HM HM HM!

SHE IS GONE?!
WELL, YOU SEE,

I--OOF!
WAH!
MORONS!
I'M SURROUNDED
BY MORONS!
I'M SURROUNDED
BY MORONS!
AAH!
BUT, BOSS,
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.
TO BE PERFECTLY
HONEST, YOU SEE,
I--UH--B-B--
THUNDER WAS ON DUTY.
TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
THUNDER WAS ON DUTY.
TAKE IT UP WITH HIM.
I LOVE THAT GIRL!
I WANT HER BACK!
NOW!
BOSS, YOU SEE,
THE THING OF IT--
NOW!
OH HO! MM HMM!
OH...
OH...
ROBIN HOOD SAYS
TO LITTLE JOHN,
"THIS SHERIFF
IS A BIMBO.
"LET'S KNOCK HIM OFF
AND TAKE THE GOLD.
"WE'LL GIVE IT TO
THE POOR SUCKERS
WHO GOT TOOK
IN THE FIRST PLACE."
WHERE DO YOU
GET THAT STUFF?
WHAT KIND OF HOOD
GIVES DOUGH TO THE POOR
WITHOUT TAKING HIS CUT?
I LIKE THIS STORY,
MR. ITCHY.
YOU WOULD.
Shut up!
I'm trying to
get the brat to sleep.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?
WELL, THEN, UH...
UH...
GIVE ME THAT.
ALL THE POOR PEOPLE
WAS HAPPY
'CAUSE THEY WASN'T
