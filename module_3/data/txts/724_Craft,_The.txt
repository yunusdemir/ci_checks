I need your seat
in the upright position, please.
Come on, let's go.
Come on, darling, taxi's waiting.
- Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah, it's a lot drier in here, Dad.
- Oh, God. We need a new roof.
-Yeah.
- But it's big. It's big.
-I like the peg and groove floors.
- Damask curtains would look nice.
-Yeah.
- I gotta get this roof fixed, honey.
-Yeah.
I found this out back.
Do you want it?
Relax. What's the matter with you?
Relax.
- Dad!
-What? What is it? What?
Hey! What the--?
Get the hell out of here!
What the hell?
Sarah, you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
He surprised me, that's all.
Yeah, I guess.
- Are you sure?
-Yeah. I'm fine.
Dad.
You could wait. You know,
just until you got a school uniform.
- You don't have to go now.
-I can't stay home...
...and watch TV
for the rest of my life.
Why not? I could.
I just wanna get started
and get it over with.
You look good. You look good.
Good luck. Jenny will pick you up.
- I'll walk.
-Are you sure?
Yeah.
- Hey, scary bitch alert.
-Oh, God. I thought it was Satan.
Oh, my God. She's-- She looking?
Oh, God. Oh, she's looking.
Find a warm place--
A safe, warm place.
The almanac says today will bring
an arrival of something.
Yeah, wonderful, I'm getting my rag.
"A new wholeness and with it,
a new balance.
Earth, air, water, fire."
Maybe it's our fourth.
- We don't need a fourth.
-Nancy, we need someone...
...to call out the corners:
north, south, east and west.
- Four would make a circle.
-Maybe she can be our fourth.
- Come on.
-I love a woman in uniform.
Oh, you mean, did I get laid?
<i>Oui, beaucoup</i> des--
<i>Beaucoup de "laid."</i>
What is that snail trail over there
saying about me?
You know, this is L.A.
We should be learning Mexican, like.
- That would be Spanish, genius.
-Spanish.
She's here.
-"She" who?
-Someone to be the fourth.
She's the one.
Are you feeling okay?
That's her.
Hey, do you guys mind
if I sit with you?
Because I'm supposed to find
a lab group.
0K8)'-
No, you-- You can sit here.
Happy?
What?
- Hi.
-Hi.
- You're Sarah, right? Hi, I'm Chris.
-Yeah.
I wanted to apologise for those guys
in French. They're assholes.
They say
you are what you hang with.
Yeah, right.
Wait, did you just
call me an asshole?
- You did, didn't you?
-I'm sorry.
My defences are up. People here
have been really rude to me.
- Oh, really? Who else?
-These three girls. Look behind you.
Don't stare.
That's slick.
- Oh, shit, it's the Bitches of Eastwick.
-What?
Whatever you do,
stay away from them.
Why?
Well, you see the one on the right?
She's a major slut.
I mean, I don't know from experience
or anything, but...
And the one in the middle, she's got
these burn scars all over her body.
I haven't seen them,
but friends of mine have.
Anyway, they're-- No, never mind.
What? What?
- They're witches.
-Witches.
Well, that's what people say.
So, what are you doing after school?
- I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
-Really?
- Really.
-I'm busy.
Football practise.
You can come to watch.
Football practise.
That is so tempting.
- Sarah. Looking for someone?
-No.
Some football dicks
make their girlfriends...
...come and watch them practise,
as if it's interesting.
Yeah, like the girlfriend over there.
Chris Hooker?
I don't even know him.
Nancy's sorry about what happened
in biology.
And she's mean to everybody,
so don't take it personally.
- You're Nancy?
-She's Nancy.
I'm Bonnie and that's Rochelle.
- Hi. I'm Sarah.
-Yeah. We know who you are.
- Do you wanna go for coffee?
-No, I can't. I gotta get home.
My dad's waiting for me.
You can make something up.
Rochelle's ditching practise.
- He comes on to anything with tits.
-Except me.
- I'm not watching him.
-He spreads disease.
I speak from personal experience.
Run, Chris! Go long!
Go for the pass, baby.
He's a jerk.
Come on.
- So you're coming, right?
-Where we going?
- Shopping.
-Come on.
- I don't have any money.
-We get a five-finger discount.
Five-finger discount.
- Sarah, where'd you live before?
-San Francisco.
- Why did you move?
-Because it sucks there.
My dad wanted to.
- It sucks here too.
-I know. You need a car here.
- You need a car everywhere.
-What's up with that?
I slit my wrists.
Sorry.
- What did you do it with?
-With a kitchen knife.
- You even did it the right way.
-Yeah.
Punk rock. Let's go.
The "right way"?
- How do you know the right way?
-Shut up, Rochelle.
Well, how do you know?
Sarah.
What?
- Put this in your bag.
-No.
Everything in nature steals, you know.
Big animals steal from little ones.
They steal for survival.
Besides, I already have a diary.
This is different. You put spells
and power thoughts in it...
...and then you don't let
anyone else read it, ever.
Except maybe us.
Here.
- You guys are really into all this?
-Sort of.
- That's not for you.
-I'm sorry.
What a beautiful ring.
It was your mother's.
Yeah, it was.
Are you going to pay for those?
You're not like your friends.
- You know how to use candles?
-Yeah. You light the wick.
More than that. Red is for love.
Black- Actually...
Why you don't read that?
- It explains it all.
-Okay.
Twenty dollars.
You know, I've never read anything
about this stuff before.
I mean, I don't follow it.
Maybe you're a natural witch.
Your power comes from within.
Come on, Sarah.
- You guys, I think I should head home.
-Just look straight ahead and keep up.
- Please, my baby needs some food.
-I don't have anything.
Don't give them money.
You're gonna get nailed.
- I don't have anything.
-Hey, I know you.
I have another snake for you.
Hey, wait a second.
I have to talk to you.
I had a dream about you.
In my dream, you were dead!
I'm talking to you.
Come back, child.
Come back to Jesus.
Don't you run away from me!
I am the god of the--
I know what I'm talking about.
I'm in touch with the man!
Listen to me!
Come on, Sarah.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, my God.
- Is anybody back there?
-No.
We hit him. It hit him.
The car hit him
and we made it happen.
- Maybe, maybe not.
-No.
I thought, "it's gonna hit him."
- I thought it too.
-Well, I thought it too.
- Sarah, did you think it?
-Yeah.
That's it. Sarah's the fourth.
North, south, east and west.
We can make things happen.
I mean, this is it. This is real.
Shit.
You guys, this is really weird.
I mean, he was after you.
He was gonna hurt you, man.
-It's not our fault, I mean--
-Maybe he'll really listen now.
- Who?
-Manon.
What's that? That's, like, God?
No, man invented God.
This is older than that.
Do you guys worship the devil?
It's like God and the devil.
I mean, it's everything.
It's the trees, it's the ground,
it's the rocks, it's the moon.
-It's everything.
-it's nature.
If God and the devil
were playing football...
...Manon would be the stadium
that they played on.
It would be the sun
that shone down on them.
So does stuff like tonight
happen to you a lot?
No. Not like that. Other stuff.
- Where did you learn it?
-I don't know.
A natural witch.
I hate it.
It's always getting screwed up.
It's like sometimes
I'll want it to rain...
...and a pipe will burst in my room
and it'll just get flooded.
- Yeah, right.
-No, really.
Or I'll want it just to be quiet,
and I'll wish for it and wish for it.
And then I'll go deaf
for three days straight.
If you can do that, have you
ever heard of invoking the spirit?
No.
That's when you call him.
Manon.
It's like--
It's like you take him into you.
It's like he fills you.
He takes everything
that's gone wrong in your life...
...and he makes it all better again.
Nothing makes everything
all better again.
Maybe not for you.
- Where are you going?
-You guys are freaking me out.
Oh, she's scared.
- Nancy, we need her.
-Like a hole in the head.
She'll be back.
What?
You sounded strange when I called
last night. I didn't think you'd come.
- No, I was just surprised.
-Surprised?
- I thought you'd be with those girls.
-What girls?
- Those girls with the weird heads.
-Weird heads?
- Yeah.
-What's weird about their heads?
Well, that one girl, you know,
she's got a mammoth head.
- Really?
-Yeah. She looks like a St. Bernard.
- I haven't noticed her.
-I hate that, that big head thing.
Of course, it's better than
that shrunken head thing.
- Hang it from the rearview mirror.
-What's your obsession with heads?
Well, I was just noticing
how great yours is.
- You like my head?
-Yeah, it's a good head.
-"It's a good head."
-it's good. It's good for kissing. Can I?
- We'll see you later, bro.
-Nice meeting you, Sarah.
- Yeah, bye.
-See you.
Come on. Let's go to my house.
Nobody's there.
I don't-- I don't wanna go.
I can't. I gotta go home.
All right.
Are you mad?
No.
I'm sorry.
It's okay.
- So, hot stuff, how did it go?
-How'd what go?
Your date with Chris.
- What are you talking about?
-Chris already told everybody.
- He told everybody what?
-That you guys did it.
But we didn't do it.
Well, maybe he was just
trying to save face then.
Because he's going around
the whole school...
...saying that you're the lousiest lay
he's ever had.
And coming from him,
that's pretty bad.
- No, he didn't.
-He did.
- He said the same thing about Nancy.
-I told you he was a jerk.
Can I talk to you for a sec? Chris?
I'm sorry. Chris is really busy.
Maybe we could set something up
for-- Nice jacket.
--later in the week.
Why did you lie about me?
Look, I don't wanna
go outwith you again.
Okay?
Please stop begging.
It's pathetic.
Hey, Chris.
Fuck you.
No.
But I will.
She's gonna cry.
And then I'm gonna cry.
Then we're all gonna cry.
This is a joke.
I can't even believe this.
Oh, wait, here she goes.
Shark!
- Very good.
-Brilliant. Superb.
Oh, God, look.
There is a pubic hair in my brush.
Oh, no, wait, wait.
That's just one of Rochelle's
little nappy hairs.
Why are you doing this to me, Laura?
Do you think you're funny?
You really wanna know why?
Yes, I really wanna know why.
Because I don't like Negroids.
Sorry.
I've told you this before,
but I wanna be really clear.
This is a very
experimental procedure.
And we can't make any warranties
regarding results or side effects.
I can tell you unofficially
that there's little to no risk.
With this form of gene therapy,
it's relatively non-invasive.
It can be somewhat painful,
but non-invasive.
Okay, try to stay relaxed.
I'm moving the armature
over you now.
And you'll feel a little sting
when the needle penetrates.
And then more
when the needle moves.
I'll try and keep it
as brief as possible.
Hold very still,
but keep breathing.
Okay?
Good. Keep your body relaxed.
Just a little more, Bonnie.
Don't move.
Ray, the light's out! Oh, man.
You-- You didn't even pay the bill.
I gave you money.
You didn't pay the bill.
What you doing home so late?
You're late.
It's the storm, Grace.
It's the connection, Grace.
- Oh, it's a storm?
-That's why the lights are out.
The neighbour's lights aren't out.
I give you money,
and you tell me you paid the bill.
But you can't even pay a bill?
What are you good for?
You know what I'm good for.
Hey, Sarah.
We're going on a field trip.
Miss Downs, I hate to interrupt
your little social gathering.
Sorry, Sister.
- Watch out for those weirdoes.
-We are the weirdoes, mister.
<i>Earth, air, fire, water</i>

...than enter the circle with fear
in your heart.
- How do you enter?
-With perfect love and perfect trust.

That's a girl.
As above, so below.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask for the ability
to not hate those who hate me.
Especially racist pieces of
bleached-blond shit like Laura Lizzie.
Right on.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I ask to love myself more
and to let myself be loved by others.
Especially Chris Hooker.
I know, it's pathetic.
Definitely pathetic.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself the power
to be beautiful outside and in.
I drink of my sisters...
...and I take into myself...
...all the power of Manon.
That's all?
Blessed be.
- Blessed be.
-Blessed be.
I thought you were gonna burp.
- Oh, my God.
-What?
Look.
-It's Manon.
-it's so beautiful.
He's listening to us.
- Do you think it's working?
-I don't know.
I think he just looked at me.
Did he look at me?
- Is he looking?
-Not right now, but he just did.
- So weird.
-I know.
- He's looking?
-Yes.
- Is he still back there?
-Yep.
- Sarah.
-Yeah?
Never mind.
-It's working.
-That, or he's gone completely crazy.
- You hate me, right?
-No.
- You don't?
-No.
Because, you see, when you're a guy,
and I am, people expect things.
I mean, I know I said
some nasty things about you.
- Did you tell your friends?
-What?
- That you're a lying sack of shit.
-No, but I will.
<i>- I'll</i> tell them tomorrow. I'll tell the truth.
- Good.
- Can I sit with you in Mass?
-Yeah, sure.
Watch this:
Chris, could you carry these for me?
They're really heavy.
Oh, and Bonnie's too.
She's got a bad back.
And this. Thanks.
Hey, Chris, could you hold my jock
for me? It's kind of heavy.
In the book of Genesis...
What are you, the Stepford boy?
Sit.
Hey. Pay attention.
It's working.
Check it out, her spell is working.
Nancy, oh, my God. Would you look?
- I'm sorry, I'm really bad.
-Get one in already.
Look, it's hard, you know.
You're like-- You're like two feet
away from each other.
Get off.
- I'm not that heavy.
-Yeah, you're light as a feather.
- During deep space travel.
-I am, actually.
Did you guys ever play that game
Light as a Feather, Stiff as a Board?
No.
One girl lays down
and you surround her...
...and you put your fingers
underneath--
Put your fingers where?
0K8)'-
Now, you take your index finger
and middle finger...
...and put it under her, like this.
Now you have to imagine
she's incredibly light, made out of air.
- Her whole body, or just her head?
-Cow!
You guys, come on, concentrate,
or it's not gonna work.
- I think I sprained my finger.
-Shut up.
Focus.
Come on, you guys.
Come on. Ready?
<i>Light as a feather
Stiff as a board</i>
<i>Light as a feather
Stiff as a board</i>
<i>Light as a feather

Holy shit!
You guys, it's not working.
Shut up, or you're gonna fall.
How do I get down?
Who's got the instructions?
Just keep concentrating.
Amazing.
Hi, I got clean towels for everyone.
Oh, my butt!
- What's going on in here?
-Nothing. Why?
- Are you girls getting high?
-No, Morn.
- Are you okay?
-You gotta try it.
- You pulled my hair out!
-Sorry, I thought I saw a bug.
They have shampoo for that,
you know.
Stupid bitch.
- Laura really has split ends.
-Really?
I guess this confirms
she's not a natural blond.
Bleach.
What do you think will happen
to Laura?
I don't know. If she leaves you alone,
nothing will happen to her.
- Nothing could.
-Fat chance.
- Who's that?
-That's my real mother.
- Where is she?
-She died when she was having me.
- Sorry.
-it's okay.
Manon. Take my scars.
Give me beauty outside
as well as in.
Manon, take my scars.
Take my scars.
Take my scars.
- Don't hit your head on the board!
-Put a lid on it, Laura.
Oh, my God!
What's the matter?
- What happened?
-I don't know.
What does it look like?
Gross!
Now I want you to remember
that we may need several passes...
...before we can see any results.
- Is it better?
-I can't tell yet, dear.
- Just a minute.
-What does it look like?
I don't know. Just wait.
I can't believe it.
- It worked.
-What?
It worked.
Bonnie.
Seriously, if you don't stop, you can--
You can go blind.
Hairy palms?
She was supposed to come back
today. Did you talk to her?
No.
--Special assembly during the
second half of the fifth period--
- Homeroom starts at 8:45 sharp.
-Sorry, my pedicure ran late.
Bonnie.
- Holy shit.
-Hi, Bonnie.
- How's it going?
-Yeah, how's it going, Bonnie?
My God.
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe it.
- You did it.
-No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. You totally did it.
-I helped.
Come on, you made Chris love you.
You own him.
You made Laura Lizzie's hair
fall out.
You guys should see her.
She has to wear a hat every day now.
Poor Laura.
- What's wrong with Nancy?
-Her spell's not working.
- What spell?
-I don't know.
I think she doesn't wanna be
white trash anymore or something.
I told her, like, "You're white, honey.
Just deal with it."
- I can almost see through this.
-Leave me alone!
- Jesus.
-God.
- You supposed to act like a father.
-I ain't her father.
Thank God.
Her father was the one
who paid you $50 for a quick bang.
H9)'-
- Don't you ever hit me!
-Don't touch her! Stop!
What the hell is that?
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
You pig.
Ray?
- O2's flowing.
-He's asystole. We got a flatline.
What's happening?
What's happening to him?
I know this is
a difficult time for you...
...but it is procedure that I ask
just a few questions...
...before we can start
processing the policy.
I don't understand. What policy?
Mr. Saunders had a whole-life
pension plan through the company.
And with benefits this size,
it's standard that I--
What size?
Just a second.
Sorry.
A hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars.
- Wait, are you saying this goes to us?
-To you.
- A hundred and seventy-five--
-What a dear, sweet man.
- A hundred and seventy-five thousand!
-A hundred and seventy-five thousand!
A hundred and seventy-five
thousand dollars!
- I can't believe he's dead.
-Do you think we killed him?
No. Not at all.
Hi! Don't be shy, honey. Nice ass.
- What? He has a cute butt.
-You're a slut.
Maybe you should go ask him out,
Bonnie.
"I like your butt.
Do you wanna have dinner?"
This is nice!
Bedroom, bathroom...
- Hi there.
-You look so pretty.
I'm so glad you could come
and see our apartment.
"Our apartment."
We have an apartment.
It is so big. And look at this view.
Look at it.
-It's beautiful.
-Oh, look at the couch.
This is our couch. I love this couch.
I saw it in the window and I said,
"I have to have this couch."
The guy, what an attitude. I said,
"Wrap it up, I'll take it now."
Cash.
My jukebox.
Every song on here
is by Connie Francis.
Yeah, isn't that great?
Ever since I was a little girl I said:
All I want in life is a jukebox...
...that plays nothing
but Connie Francis records.
That's great.
- Who's Connie Francis?
-Oh, shut up, honey. Listen and learn.
Connie Francis--
- Shall we go to my room, girls?
-It was nice to see you again.
Connie Francis is--
Wait a minute here...
- Let's have a housewarming party.
-Sorry, Mom.
This is cool.
Hey, I was reading
and I found something...
...I think you guys might be into.
"Glamour.
Throwing a glamour, an illusion
so real as to fool an onlooker...
...is one of the oldest
forms of magic."
- I bet you I could do that.
-You think?
<i>This is to feel</i>
<i>This is to be</i>
<i>Shape and form it</i>
<i>For all to see</i>
<i>By the power of three times three</i>
<i>As I will it, so shall it be</i>
- What?
-My eyes are brown.
They're usually green.
You can do that with contacts.
Yeah, but it's good.
I mean, it suits you.
- Subtle, but good.
-You want something bigger?
- I want bigger.
-Bigger.
Concentrate, come on.
Ready?
- Are you impressed?
-Yeah, I'm impressed.
- You look like Loni Anderson.
-You wanna touch it?
Yeah.
-It's real.
-And simpler than going to a salon.
- Yeah, really.
-That's amazing.
Wait, wait, wait. Watch.
- Make me blond.
-Me, me.
- No, no. Make me blond.
-I don't think so. No way!
- Do something to me.
-What do you want?
I want a smaller ass.
Sarah!
Sarah!
Oh, no.
Hey, why didn't you
answer the phone?
-It's 3:00 in the morning, Chris.
-Oh, yeah. That's a good reason.
Hey, you know what I was thinking?
I was thinking maybe
we could move in together.
I don't think I'm ready for that
kind of commitment right now.
Oh, shit. Well, it's just that, you know,
I can't stop thinking about you.
And I don't know why,
but I think I love you.
And I've never loved anyone before,
except maybe my morn...
...and this little puppy I had
when I was little--
- I think you should go home, Chris.
-No, Sarah, wait, please.
Sarah, please, look.
I don't know what's happening to me.
I can't eat. I can't sleep.
Can I help you?
No. Nobody can help me.
Here again.
What can I do for you today?
We need provisions.
I need to undo a love spell.
When you open a floodgate,
how do you undo it?
If you unleash something with a spell,
there is no undoing.
It must run its course.
You should let him suffer.
It's not for you to judge suffering.
- What's behind the curtain?
-Yeah, what are you doing back there?
Hiding all the missing kids
from the neighbourhood?
- What's there? Black magic?
-True magic is neither black nor white.
It's both because nature is both.
Loving and cruel all at the same time.
The only good or bad
is in the heart of the witch.
Life keeps a balance on its own.
Do you understand?
- Not really.
-Well, then, understand this:
Whatever you send out,
you get back times three.
- Wait, we didn't read that in any book.
-No?
It's part of a basic spiritual truth,
said in many ways, in many faiths:
Do unto others as you would
have them do unto you.
- I wanna buy this book.
-You want to invoke the spirit?
You must be experienced to do this,
it's very dangerous.
Look, lady, I'm a big girl, okay?
Now, please just sell me the book.
- How much?
-Twenty-five.
What do you know?
I have money.
When things were the worst for me--
This is before I tried to kill myself.
--I used to hallucinate things.
I'd close my eyes, and all I would see
were snakes and bugs everywhere.
And then I'd open them, and they'd
still be there. They wouldn't go away.
They're everywhere.
You know, the serpent
is a very powerful being.
You should respect it.
Aren't you powerful? Yes, you are.
All right, enough screwing around.
Let's call the corners, shall we?
<i>Hail to the guardians

<i>Manon! Fill me!</i>
Is he here?
Did you feel that?
He blessed me.
I can feel him
running through my veins.
He's still in me.
It's so amazing.
Look at this.
It's so beautiful.
This is a gift.
These are my gifts.
I can feel you in me!
I'm your daughter now.
He's everywhere! He's in everything!
Listen, all I'm saying is
I think it's enough already.
I don't know what's going on with this.
I'm completely humiliating Chris...
...when all I wanted
was for him to like me.
And, Bonnie, what's going on
with you? You used to be nice.
Now you're completely narcissistic.
Excuse me, but I spent a big chunk
of my life being a monster.
Now that I'm not, I'm having a good
time. I'm sorry that bothers you.
Can you guys tell me
what colour that light is?
It's red.
- Doesn't red mean stop?
-Yeah. Red does mean stop.
It's like what Lirio was talking about,
throwing things out of balance.
I know you guys think
we're getting what we want now...
...but it's gonna come back
to us threefold.
Are we actually having
a theological conversation here?
I mean, it's fun, it's scary.
Who gives a shit?
Oh, Nancy, we do.
- What do you guys think?
-They don't think.
Bitch.
Stop trying to win them over
because it won't work.
I'm not trying to. You're paranoid.
- I'm paranoid? I am not paranoid!
-Paranoid.
Will you guys shut up?
Do you want in, or do you wanna
leave the circle? Tell me right now.
Why does it always
have to be that way?
Because that's the way it is.
All I'm saying is
I think you should think.
And I don't want out.
One of these times,
the light's not gonna be green, Nancy.
Are we scared, Sarah?
Are you scared?
- Nancy!
-That was actually pretty close.
It just keeps falling out.
I don't understand this.
What did I do to deserve this?
Laura.
- What's the matter? What happened?
-I don't know.
I'm gonna go get somebody, okay?
Stay right here.
<i>Sarah, come on, please.</i>
<i>I mean, you look like you need
to talk to someone anyways.</i>
How do you know what I look like?
We're talking on the phone.
<i>It's important, okay? I mean,
I just need to be alone with you.</i>
<i>I have to see you.
I don't know why but--</i>
<i>Why are you being this way?
It's just dinner, come on.</i>
- I don't know. l...
-Please.
- Okay, <i>tomorrow</i> night.
<i>- Yes! Yes, yes!</i>
<i>- I'll</i> see you then.
<i>- Bye.</i>
<i>So when I started hanging out
with them, I was almost relieved.</i>
I didn't have that many
close friends in San Francisco.
It just felt really nice to belong.
I disagree with them once
and they turn their backs on me.
That's not friendship.
- Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.
-You do?
Yeah. You know, sometimes it's like
we're one person, you know?
No, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure either.
That's so funny. I was just thinking:
"I have no idea
what I'm talking about."
Aren't we supposed to go
to a restaurant or something like that?
No.
All right. Look, Chris, I know you
think you feel really intensely...
...but do you ever stop and wonder
where it comes from?
No.
I can't think, I just feel.
It's weird how it happened.
I just woke up one day
and couldn't wait to see you.
It's like that every day. But now
that I have you, I'm not letting go.
Let's just stop and think about
what you're saying here.
You don't even know me.
- Here, I'll give you a backrub.
-I don't want a backrub.
- No, it'll be nice.
-Chris, I don't want you to. Let go.
- Relax for a second. Turn around.
-I think you should take me home.
- No, Sarah, come on.
-Take me home.
Well, then just hold me, okay?
Hold me first.
Fine, I'll Walk.
- Sarah.
-No.
Sarah, get back here.
Come back here now.
Goddamn it! It's gonna happen.
Lie still.
Chris! Chris, don't, please. Let go!
Sarah!
Oh, my God. Sarah, come here.
What happened? Are you okay?
You should have seen
the look in his eyes.
It was so weird.
They seemed empty,
like it wasn't even him.
Where would he be?
There's a party.
At Trey's.
No, Nancy. Just leave it alone.
Don't go.
You're not gonna help anything.
I'm gonna g0 {flay-
I can't believe she's here.
- Hey, guys. Nancy Downs is here.
-Nancy?
I'm here. You're here. We're all here.
Is Sarah with you?
What's going on?
Where is she?
You and me, we've had
some pretty good times together.
If I remember correctly,
we had some pretty hot times too.
- Remember?
-I've been trying to forget.
Forget?
- Forget this?
-Stop.
What's the matter?
Not in the mood?
Not to get my dick bitten off.
What makes you think
that's what I wanna do?
Go away.
Go away.
What the--?
- Surprise.
-Sarah?
Make love to me, Chris.
- We should not be here.
-Neither should Nancy.
Rochelle.
- How's it going?
-Fine.
Listen.
You're a witch!
They were right.
- They usually are.
-Nancy, come on.
Get off the bed. Let's go.
She's a witch too, you know.
The only reason you're in love with her
is because she cast a spell on you.
- No.
-Yes. Sad but true.
That's why I'm here.
To help you forget about her.
- What do you care?
-Nancy, get off the bed.
You scared the shit out of him.
Thank you very much. Let's go.
No. He's gotta pay.
You're just jealous.
Jealous?
Jealous?
You don't even exist to me.
You don't even exist.
You are nothing.
You are shit. You don't exist.
The only way you know
how to treat women...
...is by treating them like whores
when you're the whore!
And that's gonna stop!
Do you understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?
I'm sorry.
He's sorry! Oh, he's sorry,
he's sorry, he's sorry!
He's sorry! He's sorry! He's sorry!
Sorry, my ass!
No!
I didn't want--
I didn't want him to get hurt.
I liked him.
I think that he was a good
guy underneath it all.
- I didn't know it would go this far.
-Honey, come on.
I mean, it's hard for you.
It was an accident. He fell.
Dad, I need to be alone right now,
okay?
- Honey, listen--
-Don't touch me.
Everything I touch turns to shit.
<i>I bind you from doing harm, Nancy</i>
<i>Harm against other people
And harm against yourself</i>
<i>I bind you from doing harm, Nancy</i>

Sarah...
Stop it!
- Stop it!
-Sarah!
There you are.
We've been looking everywhere
for you.
- Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.
We heard the police
came to your house.
They came to mine too.
Yeah, well,
I didn't tell them anything.
Well, then why do you wanna
leave the circle?
- I didn't say--
-You don't need to say it.
You're thinking it.
Look, Nancy, people are dead, okay?
Chris and Ray--
Those were accidents.
- They deserved it.
-Says who?
Says me. And you know it's true.
Fine, whatever. I'm out.
Fine. That's fine.
We don't really need a fourth
anymore, do we, girls?
No.
But if you're gonna leave...
...you might wanna think about
leaving the school.
And maybe the city too.
We're not sure.
Or the planet.
And please don't do any more spells
on me.
I didn't.
You know...
...in the old days...
...if a witch betrayed her coven...
...they would kill her.
Bye.
Sweet dreams, Sarah.
How have you been sleeping?
Hello?
Hello!
Yes?
Hello.
- Hi.
-What's wrong?
Oh, darling, what's wrong?
Look, I know that I don't know you
very well or anything...
...but I--
I just didn't know where else to go.
It's those girls that I always
come in here with.
They're trying to use magic
against me.
You don't understand.
They killed people.
And I tried to do a binding,
and it didn't work.
Now it's like
they're everywhere I turn.
They're all around me, and no matter
what I do, they're still there.
I don't know what to do.
You don't understand.
She's inside my dreams.
She knows what's going on
inside my head.
She can read my mind.
I'm so sorry. I just didn't
have anywhere else to go.
Please.
Come.
What is this?
This temple is built
on a place of power.
You have a tremendous light
inside you.
More than any witch
I've ever known.
- You must not be afraid.
-I can't control it.
I always end up hurting somebody.
Do you hear the voice of your mother?
What about her?
She's telling you to be strong.
She was a witch too, of course.
- Didn't you know?
-No.
You can defeat those
who challenge you.
But you must surrender yourself
to the higher power.
- You must invoke the spirit.
-But it made Nancy crazy.
She takes it to a dark place.
- Don't be afraid. Invoke him.
-I can't.
There is no other way.
<i>Hail to the guardians
of the watchtowers of the north</i>
It's Nancy. I can't stay here.
Sarah, stop! Sarah!
Hello?
Dad?
Jenny?
Hello?
<i>They're gone.
They flew back to San Francisco.</i>
<i>They thought you ran away
back home.</i>
<i>Look, Sarah,
there's been an accident.</i>
What are you talking about?
What?
<i>It's been all over the news.</i>
<i>Go look at your TV.</i>
<i>Wreckage from the plane
was scattered over a one-mile area.</i>
<i>Authorities suspect wind shear
may have been responsible.</i>
<i>The FAA has retrieved the black box.
An investigation is pending.</i>
<i>Once again: Global flight 321
from Los Angeles to San Francisco...</i>
<i>...has crashed with no survivors.</i>
<i>More on this story
as details become available.</i>
<i>We'll also be going live
with Carla Hale and the...</i>
Please stop. Stop it.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Gotcha!
God. If I was as pathetic
as you are...
...I would have killed myself ages ago.
You should get on with it.
Where are my dad and Jenny?
Oh, you'll be seeing them
soon enough.
You're going to kill yourself tonight,
my dear.
No, I'm not.
Surprise.
No.
Really?
The look in your eyes tells me
you might not be so sure.
After all, you have every reason
in the world to do it.
I mean, you killed Chris...
...and you killed your mom.
You killed your mom coming out of her.
Now, that is really special.
Even I couldn't go that low. Bravo.
Stop it, please!
What's the deal?
Why doesn't she use magic on us?
Because she's weak!
Weak, weak, weak.
Stop, please.
Oh, God, you're so disgusting.
<i>Now is the end
Let her go in peace</i>
<i>Now is the end
Let her go in peace</i>
- I didn't write that.
-Doesn't matter.
Handwriting still looks the same.
What's wrong with your scars,
Sarah?
- It isn't real.
-Then why are you still bleeding?
Run! Run back up to your room,
like the little coward that you are.
She's so pathetic!
Damn it! Stop!
- Please, somebody help me.
-"I'm bleeding."
Please.
What did I do?
Rochelle, go upstairs.
See what's going on.
- No. This whole thing, it's just--
-No?
No.
Get your lazy ass up those stairs
or I'll slit your throat!
You're as dead as she is.
Come on, I'll go with you. Shit.

Sarah?
Did I frighten you, Nancy?
I'm sorry.
What's going on?
Why aren't you dead?
He came to me. Saved me.
Oh, and he wanted me
to give you a message:
You're in deep shit.
He says you've abused
what he's given you.
And now you're gonna
have to pay the price.
- Did he?
-He did.
By the way, what happened
to Rochelle and Bonnie?
They rushed out of here
without even saying goodbye.
It's bad manners.
What's going on? What is going on'?
Stop it!
Stop it!
Oh, relax, it's only magic.
Now who's pathetic?
I know I'm a little crazy.
I don't mean to be.
It all got out of hand, and I'm sorry.
No more games, okay?
Sarah, I'm so sorry.
Good.
- I'm gonna go.
-One thing first.
<i>I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm</i>
<i>Harm against other people

<i>- Wait.
- I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm</i>
<i>Harm against other people

<i>- Wait.
- I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm</i>
<i>Harm against other people

<i>I bind you--</i>
I called him first!
You bitch, I'll kill you!
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
Where are you?
Where are you, Sarah?
Where are you?
Tricky. Tricky, tricky, tricky.
<i>I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm</i>
<i>I bind you, Nancy, from doing harm</i>
- Sarah?
-Hi, Sarah. How are you?
Good. Then again,
I can sleep at night so...
How are you?
We want to apologise.
- We feel really bad about--
-Trying to kill me?
Yeah.
Honestly, we never thought
it would go that far.
Oh, hi, girls. How you doing?
- Hi, Mr. Bailey.
-Hi, Mr. Bailey.
You know that thing on TV about
the plane crash was just a glamour?
I mean, it was a practical joke.
- Funny.
-Sarah, wait.
We were just wondering,
do you still have any powers?
Because we don't.
Sorry.
So if you ever want to hang out
and chant, or call the corners...
Maybe.
Hold your breath until I call.
She probably doesn't
have any powers anyway.
Be careful.
You don't wanna end up like Nancy.
It's you. It's you.
He did it. He gave me power.
I can do whatever I want now.
I can fly!
I can--
He gave you something, honey.
But it ain't the power.
But I can fly. I'm flying. I'm flying.
I'm flying. I'm flying.
I can fly. I'm flying.
I'm flying.
