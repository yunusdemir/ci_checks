Get away from the window.
This way, please.
The flowers look gorgeous.
You're very welcome, Christy.
Very welcome.
To your humble abode.
Yes. My humble abode. Yes.
Hello. My name is Mary.
I'll be with you till you go on.
I'll take him into the library.
- I'll see you later.
- See you later.
- Be careful of that fellow.
- Shut your mouth.
I'll be okay.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
You're all very welcome...
to my humble abode
and to this benefit...
organized by my friend,
Dr. Eileen Cole.
Dr. Eileen Cole.
I'm not going to ask you to put
your hands in your pockets...
not yet...
because we're going to start
the evening with a little concert.
Do you want to watch?
No.
Do you want to see the original?
The original?
Of the book.
It looks good.
Looks can be deceiving.
It's a bit sentimental.
Did you paint this?
That's very good.
Mr. Brown...
your son was born
a couple of hours ago.
There's been some complications.
Where's the small one?
A pint and small one?
That's what I said.
So long as you're paying for it.
Are you going to put him
in a home, Paddy?
I'll go in a coffin
before any son of mine goes in a home.
Paddy, I believe it's the end
of the road for you...
in the breeding stakes.
Who told you that?
Now, what are you going to do, huh?
You going to tie a knot in it?
There was no need for that.
A shut mouth catches no flies.
Where's Tom?
Is Tom not up yet?
Don't! I'm up! I'm up!
I'm up ages!
Say good-bye to Christy, Father.
Good-bye, Christy.
Get going.
See you later.
See you, Christy.
Something for the money box, Christy.
Another pound saved, Christy.
Right?
That's it.
I have to go away, Christy.
To hospital.
Don't worry. Sheila's going
to look after you while I'm gone.
Do you understand, Christy?
That's my ma.
That's my da.
I was their baby.
It's only for a few days.
Better get this house organized
before I go.
You can't be sticking to me
like plaster forever, Christy.
Nearly there, Christy.
I have to make a phone call.
Stay there.
My God! Nan!
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
I heard this terrible banging
and rushed over.
She was carrying Christy down the stairs
when she fell.
There he was, lying at the bottom
of the stairs like a moron.
God help her. He's a terrible cross
to the poor woman.
He has the mind
of a three-year-old.
"'A' is for apples.
'B' is for butter.
'C' is for carrot.
And 'D'...
is for dunce."
You poor, unfortunate gobshite.
Enough to feed an army.
You'll never go hungry, Christy.
Would you like to come back with me
till your mammy comes home?
What's 25  of a quarter?
25  of a quarter?
Is that a stupid question?
I mean, 25  is a quarter.
You can't divide a quarter of a quarter.
You can.
Can't you, Christy?
What would he know?
Christy picked up the chalk.
Go on, Christy.
Make your mark.
It's a "Y."
It's an "X."
What's that, Christy?
That's only a squiggle.
There's something in that.
Don't be getting notions into your head.
He's a cripple. Face facts.
Won't do anybody any good
trying to put ideas in his head.
Rachel, look. Watch this.
Come on. I'm going to put
the engine on now.
- You're putting an engine on it?
- Yeah. Come on.
Come on, engine.
All he needs now is a license.
That's great.
Take it easy. Go on.
Take it easy.
That's great.
He can play with the other boys now.
- Look at those!
- They're massive!
Cor! What's that?
That's her thing.
You put your thing in there
for a half an hour...
and you get a baby.
If you do it for an hour,
you get twins.
My cousin's a twin.
Benny! Brian!
- There's your ma.
- Quick, Tom. Here's Ma!
- It's not my magazine.
- Is Benny in there?
- Hide it!
- Where?
Come in this minute
for your tea.
- Hide it under Christy.
- Are you deaf?
I've been calling you
for 20 minutes to come in for tea.
- Come on, Christy.
- It's okay. We'll take him.
Take him in now.
It's been on the table for half an hour.
Why won't he go to bed?
He loves that chariot.
Come on, get him up.
I want to go have a pint.
Come on, Christy.
It's way past your bedtime.
It's nearly closing time.
Now, son, you know
you can never get out of hell.
You can get out of purgatory...
but you can never get out of hell.
Do you know that?
Do you?
Mrs. Brown?
I don't think you should bring him
to the altar just yet.
You've been very helpful, Father.
Do you know all about
All Souls' Night?
Did I ever tell you about that?
It's a special night...
because every time you light a candle
on All Souls' Night...
and say five "Our Fathers," five
"Hail Marys" and five "Glory Bes"...
and then a soul
flies up out of the flames...
and goes straight up to heaven.
Say some prayers
for the poor souls in purgatory.
Right.
What's wrong with you?
Keep your voice down.
What's wrong with you?
What's the matter?
What do you want?
Do you want to light
another candle?
Do you? For the poor souls?
Good boy.
That's a good boy.
Don't forget, even if we can't
understand you, God can.
See, Christy?
Even God has to lock His house.
Look, Christy, there it is!
There's a poor soul going up to heaven.
Oh, look! Look, Christy. Look.
- You frightened the life from him.
- Here, Christy.
You're king of the bonfire.
Don't be frightened.
It's only your brother Tom.
This way, Christy.
This way.
You all right?
What's Christy doing?
Is he all right?
He's drawing.
He's drawing a triangle.
You don't start there.
Here, son.
Now that's a triangle.
That's not a triangle.
That's an "A."
- What's up?
- Keep quiet.
- All I said was "What's up?"
- Sit down!
Here, Paddy.
- Go have a pint.
- What?
- What's that?
- It's money.
- Where'd you get it?
- From the fairies.
Go have a drink.
I don't need a drink. All I need
is to be obeyed in me own house.
Mother.
Sweet Jesus.
Jesus suffering Christ!
He's a Brown!
He's a Brown all right!
Christy's a Brown!
- Out.
- Where're you going?
Where do you think?
This man deserves a jar.
This is Christy Brown!
My son!
Genius.
Hello.
- Is he okay?
- He's grand.
Good.
It's just he can be a bit--
- What?
- A bit like Christy.
He's fine.
He's asleep.
I'll leave you alone then.
Fourteen.
Fifteen.
- Sixteen.
- Keep your voice down.
Seventeen.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Christy
Happy birthday to you
- Go on now, me boy.
- He's a man now, Father.
Come on, 17 candles.
Now take a deep breath.
Will you shut that baby up,
for Christ's sake?
Take it easy, Christy.
Go on.
Go on, Christy.
It's like the bleedin' fire of hell,
that one is.
There you are.
There now.
That's it.
Don't worry.
You'll get your wish.
Save it, Christy!
Well saved, Christy!
He bit me!
- He'll pay.
- We're taking it.
- Come on.
- Pass it, will you?
Stay away from them sheets.
He handled it.
Penalty. Give us that.
Let Christy take it.
You can't hold him up.
Right.
He came with the left like a cannon.
If it stops at Tom,
I'll kill you.
- Nobody.
- No. Nobody.
It's pointing at Christy.
- He's not in the game.
- He is if it's pointing at him.
I don't think it's pointing at me.
You're the nicest of the lot.
And you've nice eyes, too.
Ah, Christy, our boy.
Chasing the women.
See you, Tom.
- See you, Rachel.
- See you, Tom.
Ring wedding bells for Christy.
Not here, Brendan.
Later.
This is a fine time of night
to be coming in.
I don't like these late nights,
Sheila.
What's this?
Holiday pay, isn't it?
I got laid off.
What about Christy's wheelchair?
Christy will get his wheelchair.
Why did you get laid off?
Don't you question me
in front of the children.
A brick hit the foreman in the head
accidentally on purpose.
It's Rachel.
How are you?
"Your beautiful eyes
are splendid pools of blue...
in whose depths I swim regularly."
It's lovely.
He even signed it himself.
"He even signed it himself."
"C.B."
That's not Tom Brown.
That's Christy.
Sure he did it
with his left foot.
You're in love with a cripple.
She's in love with a cripple!
Rachel, come back!
Could I speak to Christy Brown, please?
You're wanted!
Did you paint that?
Yeah.
I can't take it.
I'm sorry.
Tell your brother Tom
we were asking for him.
What's this?
What does it look like?
But we had porridge for breakfast.
So?
Now we have it for dinner.
So?
I'm not eating any more.
You get that into you.
I can't.
Get it into you.
Go on. More.
I don't like porridge.
- What did you say?
- Nothing.
What did he say?
He said the porridge is lovely.
Keep quiet!
Come on, Christy.
Everybody has to go to bed.
I have to do my painting.
I know you have to paint, but everybody
must go to bed because there's no coal.
Don't push me nerves any further,
all right?
I'm sorry.
Someday you'll have a place
of your own.
Come on, then.
I want my painting.
Are all those kids in bed?
What's up, Christy?
You cold?
Cold.
Cold?
- It's too early.
- It's cold!
Mister!
Your plan's not working, Christy.
Wait till it goes up the hill.
Hold the baby.
Hurry up there.
We'll be warm for the whole winter,
Christy.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
What's happened to you?
It's all right, Ma.
It's only coal.
I know where you got that coal.
You know it's a sin to steal!
God is looking down on you right now.
That coal is not coming into this house.
Come in here and sit by the fire, woman.
Want me to wash you?
Bye, Christy.
Don't be late!
- There's something wrong with Christy.
- Something wrong with him.
What's wrong?
Fire.
The fire.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
- What are you trying to do?
- Get water quick!
Hurry up.
What's wrong? Are you mad?
What's in the box?
- Christy's money.
- What?
Money for Christy's wheelchair.
Must be 20 pounds in there.
28 pounds, seven and three pence.
We've been sitting
in the freezing cold...
eating porridge for breakfast,
dinner and tea...
and you have 28 pounds seven and
three pence up the fucking chimney!
Tom, Brian, everybody,
upstairs!
Now!
Ma, what's going on?
You, too, Christy.
Your daughter's getting married.
That's wonderful news.
- When?
- Friday.
What's the rush?
She's pregnant.
That's great news.
That's wonderful.
That's just what we need!
Who's the father,
or do you know?
Leave me alone.
It's not my fault.
Then whose fault is it?
ls it mine?
That's a lovely picture.
The old woman in the shoe, the daughter
who couldn't keep her knickers on.
Stop it. Stop it!
You dirty, sleazy bitch.
Stop it, Father!
She should be thrown out!
Whoring herself.
- I warned you about fornication.
- Get away from me.
Learn to keep your legs shut!
Paddy, leave her!
If I get hold of you, I'll break
every bone in your fucking body!
- I'll fucking kill him.
- Christy, stop.
- What am I going to do in this house?
- Christy, stop.
Stop him.
He's gone now, Christy.
Christy, come on.
It's okay.
Christy, I'm going away.
I'll miss you, too.
Look after Ma for me.
I need a light.
- What?
- I need a light.
I don't smoke.
I'm not deaf. I can hear you.
You need a light.
I haven't got matches.
You'll have to wait while I go get one.
Don't think I'm your mother just 'cause
I'm looking after you for the evening.
I don't need a psychology lesson.
I just need a fucking light.
- Light.
- Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?
Glass.
No point in drinking out of the bottle.
Hello. Dr. Cole, please.
Hello, Eileen.
Yes.
Athetoid cerebral palsy?
- He's 19?
- Yes, 19.
Yes, 19.
Yes, that's correct.
I'll get his address.
Dr. Cole thinks...
that this model
would be the best for your son.
Which one?
This one here?
- That is grand.
- Good.
See that there?
He won a prize for that.
It's lovely.
There's some nice ones here.
- What's that?
- Nothing. See that? lsn't that lovely?
That one got torn,
but we put it together.
That's his first one he ever did.
See?
Watch your step.
Christy, there's someone to see you.
This is Dr. Cole.
Hello, Christy.
You're a great painter.
Thank you.
I'm a doctor like your mother says...
and I specialize in cerebral palsy.
We've just started a clinic in Dublin.
Would you like to attend it?
Can't afford it.
We don't have to pay.
Well?
"Hope deferred maketh the heart sick."
- He said, "Hope deferred--"
- "Make a heart sick."
I understood that.
Ah, come on.
Maybe.
Good.
Come on in, Christy, come on in.
Please, please?
You have to. What do you want them
to do? Tow you behind?
You want to ride up front
with the driver?
Come on, Christy.
Come up front with me.
- I'm all right.
- He said he's all right.
Eileen!
Eileen, come here.
Easy. Come on, relax.
- What?
- I want to go home.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
The door's been locked for days.
I've got to try it.
Tell him I'm here.
Go away!
There's somebody here to see you.
Another time.
"I'm not a child," he says. There are
too many children at the clinic.
If you like, we can work here.
Fuck off!
With speech therapy, I could teach you
how to say "fuck off" more clearly.
One, two...
three, four, five.
And over again.
One, two.
Just relax.
Three, four, five. That's it.
One, two, three and out.
Breathe.
No, your lungs are too weak.
Here. Leave it be.
Try this instead.
Blow.
Now you have a go.
Go ahead. Blow.
Steady, steady.
And one big breath.
That's very good! That's very good.
Now, focus the breath.
Breathe, slowly. And--
He's been like that for three days now.
I don't know what's wrong with him.
He won't talk to me.
Go on up and see him!
Go on!
I've brought you a present.
Don't.
There's a speech in there
I'd love you to have a look at.
It's "To Be Or Not To Be."
Hamlet.
I wish you'd stop feeling sorry
for yourself.
I don't want to be a failure, either.
Will you have a look at it for me?
Maybe.
"To be...
or not to be."
"To be...
or not to be...
that is the question."
"To be or not to be...
that is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind"...
to have to fuck and suffer
listening to that?
He's in love with this girl, Eileen.
Well...
so long as he's gettin' better.
He could get hurt.
A broken body's nothing
to a broken heart.
Come.
Hi. How's it goin'?
Very, very well.
- I've got some news for you.
- What?
Remember I told you about Peter
and his gallery?
Yes.
Well, he's offered you
an exhibition of your own.
What do you think about that?
I think you're brilliant.
I'm only as brilliant as my patients.
"Consummation.
Devoutly to be wished.
To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.
Ay, there's the rub.
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come--"
- Is that our Christy?
- What?
Does that sound like our Christy?
Sounds a lot better.
Not to me, it doesn't.
Are you mad, woman?
You can understand your child
for the first time.
I always understood him.
Nobody else ever did.
At least he can function now.
There's something in that voice
that disturbs me.
What do you mean?
Too much hope in it.
What?
There's too much hope in it.
"Fly to others
that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards
of us all."
- What was it?
- "Thus the native hue--"
Thus the native hue of resolution
is sicklied o'er...
with the pale cast of thought...
and enterprises
of great pith and moment...
with this regard
their currents turn awry...
and lose the name of action."
What do you think about Hamlet?
A cripple who can't act.
- He did in the end.
- Too late.
Eileen...
I like you very much.
And I like you.
You have the heart of a poet.
No.
Oh, um--
What?
Nothing.
I better go.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.
It gives me great pleasure
to open this exhibition...
of the work of Christy Brown.
A lot of people say that Christy
is a great crippled painter.
- I think that's an insult to Christy.
- That's right!
Christy is simply
a great painter full stop.
He has struggled with his material,
as every painter must do...
to bring it under control.
If you look around the walls today...
you'll see the forces
that shape Christy Brown.
His mother, his father...
his brothers and sisters...
and the lady who brought him
to public recognition, Dr. Eileen Cole.
Yes!
What do you think?
There are only two kinds of painting.
Religious and the circus.
Give us a drink.
- There you are.
- Yeah.
You've had enough to drink.
Don't have any more.
I'm all right. I'm going for a meal.
You going with me?
I'm going to take your father home.
He's not feeling well.
There's no pints, you mean.
It's good wine.
Your father never drank anything
but pints in his life.
No, I'll take him home.
You getting a taxi?
- Eileen's giving us a lift.
- All right.
- I'll see you later, Ma.
- I'll see you later.
I think Mulcahy is a great painter...
in the soul.
You see? I agree with Christy.
He's too uncontrolled for me.
Let Christy try the wine.
- What's he saying?
- The Latin mass.
I thought it was James Joyce.
The wine's A-1.
- Can you tell us what year it is?
- I'm not that sophisticated.
Not yet.
I love you.
And I love you.
No. I really love you.
I love you all.
That's good.
I even love Peter.
I'm glad you like Peter because we're
going to get married in six months.
Christy, what do you think of that?
Congratulations...
Peter and Eileen...
on the...
wonderful news.
I'm glad that you taught me
how to speak...
so I could say that, Eileen.
Well, where were we then?
- Discussing Mulcahy.
- Mulcahy's empty.
-I thought you said he was full of soul.
-I said he was empty. Whiskey!
Take it easy.
You're not my mother.
Never forget that.
Yeah, I know what age that is.
That's ten-year-old.
Same age as me.
Don't give him any more.
- Pour!
- Take that whiskey from him.
Touch it, and I'll kick you...
in the only part...
of your anatomy that's animated.
Stop it.
Why did you say you love me?
Because I do love you.
You mean platonic love.
I've had nothing but platonic love...
all my life.
Do you know what I say?
Fuck Plato...
and fuck all love...
that's not 100  commitment.
Pour.
- I can't let you go any further.
- Let's discuss later.
Will you be quiet, Christy?
What are you going
to do about it, Peter?
You're a nice man.
What are you going to do?
Peter, sit down.
I'm going to wheel you out
of this restaurant.
Stop!
Wheel out the cripple!
Get the fucking brakes!
Will you stop it?
You bastard, stop it!
Sharon!
Come in for your tea.
Come on in for your tea.
Sharon, come in.
Come in now for your tea, please.
All right, Ma.
Get up.
You've got a hangover.
That's all that's wrong.
Leave me alone.
You get more like
your father every day.
All hard on the outside,
and putty on the inside.
It's in here battles are won...
not in the pub...
pretending to be a big fella
in front of the lads.
Right?
If you've given up, I haven't.
What do you think you're doing?
Building a room for you.
Don't be mad.
Maybe if you have a room of your own,
you might start painting again.
You have me heart broken,
Christy Brown.
Sometimes I think you are me heart.
If I could give you my legs,
I would gladly take yours.
What's wrong with you, Christy?
I'm sorry.
What in the name of God
is going on here?
Christy and me is building a room.
- Building a room?
- Yep.
Have a look at this.
Christy, you may be a great painter,
but you'll never be a bricky.
Fair play to you, missus.
Right, lads.
You bring in some more bricks.
Mix a little bit of muck.
Bring me in me level.
Brown and Son contractors
are on the job.
Here. You start over there.
I'll start over here.
By the time you have three courses,
I'll be finished here.
Not at all.
- Water.
- Water. Oh, water.
I'm not fading yet, by Jesus.
Father, father.
Listen, boys, listen to me.
Let your father win.
He needs this.
Here.
Take it easy, Father, will you?
Take it easy?
I was never able to take it easy...
and you, of all people,
ought to know that.
Right, lads?
That's her. Finished.
They've a long way to go
to be a better man than their father.
Well, Christy...
that's the nearest he'll ever come
to saying he loves you.
- I'm parched. Do you want a cup of tea?
- I'd love it.
- I'll just put the kettle on.
- All right, Ma.
Come on. Who's in there?
These kids! Their tomfoolery!
Come on, let me in!
What's going on?
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph! Christy!
- What?
Christy, your father's lying
on the floor, and I can't open the door.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Paddy!
I can't open the door!
- Get out of the way.
- I can't open the door.
Jesus, open the door.
Push, Christy, push!
Jesus. Paddy?
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
Paddy.
Seven pounds, five shillings
and six pence he owed.
I was the toughest of all
I was the toughest of all
Band played yet, Christy?
Drinks for everyone!
Take it easy, Christy.
Tell him to get some drinks.
I pledge you, Christy.
Your old fella will never be dead.
How will Ma survive?
Don't be worrying about that.
We'll be all right.
Terry, will you tell us
about when you and me old fella...
carried on that night
with Williams?
Later.
Yeah.
Give us a song, somebody!
Jesus. Hey, Tom, give us a song.
I'm all right. Yeah.
As down the glen
One Easter morn
To a city fair rode I
There armed lines of marching men
In squadrons--
Will somebody shut him up?
No pipes did hum
No battle drum
Did sound its loud tattoo
But the Angelus Bell
Hey! You'll have
to keep it down a bit there, lads.
In the foggy dew
- He was singing that for his father.
- His father was a mouth.
Triumphant--
Like all the Browns.
All right, lads.
Take it easy.
In respect for Da.
I don't fight cripples.
Hold on. Hold on!
Get the bum!
Come on, Christy!
Somebody get the tin!
Get the tin! Get the money!
That's great.
No, it's not.
Why not?
It's not Da.
I have no eye.
- What?
- I'm not a painter.
We think it's brilliant.
It's the image of Da.
Poor Tom, what?
Yeah.
"All is nothing.
Therefore nothing must end."
- What's all this?
- Nothing.
Sorry I asked.
Benny, would you help us?
Doin' what?
Writing.
Yeah. Writing what?
Me own story.
Yeah!
Of course I will!
- Well?
- Don't worry. The book is great.
It's not bad.
Do you know what
I was going to call it?
What?
The Reminiscences...
Reminiscences.
of a Mental Defective.
That's a terrible title.
It was my blue period.
And you typed all of it
with your left foot?
I didn't do it with my nose.
I really wanted to finish it.
You'll hear it later.
I have an appointment.
I told you.
Is he good-looking?
- Who?
- Your appointment.
Yeah, in his own way, he's nice.
It doesn't matter to me.
You can meet who you like.
- Well, is he, now?
- What?
Is he good-looking?
Yeah.
Are you in love with him?
You're very bloody nosy,
Christy Brown.
I was only asking.
Would you like a drink?
I'm working. I can't.
Later.
- I have a date. I told you.
- Yeah, I forgot.
- You're a fast worker, aren't you?
- Read your book.
I can't with you staring at me.
I'll look away.
Oh, God.
She's very pretty, isn't she?
Prettier than that bloody picture.
Wait a minute.
Ma, are you in?
All right.
Jesus! 800 pounds, Christy.
That was scrumptious, Ma.
Like you.
I fancy something sweet now.
What have you for dessert?
- What have you for dessert?
- Dessert?
Kids, do you not fancy ice cream?
Ice cream.
Get us some ice cream.
- Get us some Neapolitan.
- All right, all right!
The pink and green stuff.
Just this once, mind you. It's naughty
to spend me money on ice cream.
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
What's this?
What's this?
- It's money, Ma. Bring it here.
- Count it.
800 pound.
That's more money than your poor father
ever earned in a whole year.
I can't take it.
It's for you. It's yours.
I can't take it, son.
Da was a bricklayer, Ma,
and I'm a writer.
I know it's mad, but...
I want you to have it.
What would I do with it?
Well, to start...
get yourself a dress
and a new pair of shoes.
Will you?
Christy, you have a visitor.
You look well.
So do you.
Thank you.
Sit down.
Look, I won't stay very long.
Stay as long as you like.
I need to ask you a favor.
- What?
- A benefit.
Where?
Lord Castlewelland's.
Him? He's mad!
Posh?
Filthy rich.
I know you don't like appearing
in public, but it's for a good cause.
For the cripples.
- For the cripples.
- Yeah.
I'll try to behave myself.
- It won't upset you too much?
- All I need is to ease myself.
Not too much!
How's Peter?
- We have to get going, Christy.
- Yeah.
What do you think?
Too much self-pity?
No, I think he's a lovely man,
and not in the least sentimental.
Mary, do you really think so?
Yep.
Would you go out with him?
Certainly.
Now, listen, everyone.
So you'd go out with me?
I might.
He's talking about you.
I want to introduce you
to one of the bravest...
well, quite the bravest chap
I've ever come across.
Yes, now, when Christy Brown was born...
the doctors told his mother that--
Stay with us for a couple of hours.
Just a vegetable for the rest
of his life.
But she wouldn't take that.
Would you go out with me tonight?
I told you.
I have an appointment.
So we have with us here tonight--
Are you in love with him?
I asked you,
did you love him, Mary?
I introduce to you Christy Brown...
a man of genius.
Mary, I asked you a question.
Do you?
- It's none of your business.
- So you won't answer me?
Why should l?
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything! Or you.
You're afraid of yourself.
- Oh, come on. Just--
- You're afraid of me.
- We can't talk about this now.
- Why can't we talk? Now is good for me.
- I'll see you again sometime.
- Sometime. I've heard that before.
Why is it always some fucking time?
Mary, stay.
Stay!
We've got to go.
All right. Take me out
to the firing squad.
I'm honored to be asked...
to give voice to the words
of Christy Brown.
"I was born in the Rotunda Hospital
on June 5, 1932.
There were 22 children in all...
of which 13 survived.
It would not be true to say
I'm no longer lonely.
I have made myself articulate...
and understood to people
in many parts of the world.
This is something we all wish to do...
whether we're crippled or not.
Yet, like everyone else...
I am acutely conscious sometimes
of my own isolation...
even in the midst of people.
I often give up hope of ever being able
to really communicate with them.
It is not only the sort of isolation
that every writer or artist...
must experience in the creative mood...
if he's to create anything at all.
It's like a black cloud
sweeping down on me unexpectedly...
cutting me off from others.
A sort of deaf goodness.
I lay back in my chair...
while my old left foot beat time
to a new rhythm.
Now I could relax
and enjoy myself completely.
I was at peace...
happy."
Mother, stand up.
It's yours.
Come here.
Christy, no. Don't.
Give us one of them flowers.
You're not coming with us in the car?
You're mad! It's great!
Get in the car before I kick your ass.
Good luck, Christy.
Good night.
Good night.
Go on. I'm all right.
Will you get in the car now, Ma?
I'm fine.
Good night, Christy.
Be careful.
You're not me da, Tom.
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy yourself!
Let's go.
Christy, here.
Tuck that in there.
Thank you.
I hope to see you again.
I hope to see you again, Christy...
before closing time.
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Not at all.
You can just see Joyce's Tower
down there.
And that's where John M. Synge was born
at the foot of the mountains.
What will we drink to?
Let's drink to Dublin.
To Dublin? Why?
Because Christy Brown was born there.
