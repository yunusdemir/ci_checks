MAN: Mummy got sick.
And it happened just like that.
There's nothing
anybody could do.
It isn't fair.
There's no reason.
And if we start asking why,
we'll go crazy.
Five minutes
in the microwave.
Any one of them.
Five minutes,
and ready to eat.
Do you know
how to make juice?
Microwave.
Five minutes.
Here. It's my shrink.
Call him.
Loss of Spouse
Support Group.
Chicago Cancer
Family Network.
Parents without Partners.
Partners without Parents.
"Hug Yourself," "Hug a Friend,"
"Hug a Shrink." Or work.
Work hard, work will save you.
Work is the only thing that will
see you through this.
Don't mind him,
he's just a guy
who's lost his wife.
What I think we really
need is change.
Good idea. Take a couple
of weeks off, get some sun,
take Jonah fishing.
No, real change.
A new city.
Some place where every time
I go around a corner
I don't think of Maggie.
ROB:
Where are you gonna go?
I was thinking about Seattle.
Eventually, in a few months,
you'll start seeing women.
You'll meet someone.
Right, right. Move on, right,
that's what I'm gonna do.
And then in a few months,
boom, I'll be fine.
I'll just grow a new heart.
Sam, I'm sorry--
She didn't mean that.
I know, I know.
Look, it just doesn't
happen twice.

"AS TIME GOES BY" PLAYS]
Sleepless in Seattle (1993)
The tall one with red hair
is your cousin Irene.
You'll recognize her
by the disappointed
look on her face.
Married to Harold,
who ran off with
the secretary.
Who came back because
Irene threatened to put
the dog to sleep if he didn't.
Your brother Dennis
is professor
at Johns Hopkins.
He's married to,
uh, Betsy.
The most competitive woman
in the world.
I don't see how I'm gonna
remember all this.
Oh, well, Walter,
you will!
Sleepless in Seattle (1993)
Your Uncle Milton
lost all of his money.
And some other people's.
in a pyramid scheme.
Don't mention the IRS
or the federal prisons system.
Your mother's Barbara,
your father's Cliff
My father has electric trains.
Really?
Am I what they had
in mind?
Oh, Walter,
they're gonna love you!
[GLASS CLINKING]
WOMAN: Everybody,
Annie has an announcement.
Oh... Walter and I
are engaged.
[SCREAMING]
Thank you.
Thank you.
Mum knew.
Dad, Mum knew.
I don't see a ring, Annie.
Congratulations, Walter.
[SNEEZING]
Bless you. Bless you!
CLIFF: Are you all right?
It's nothing. It's nothing.
Maybe it's the flowers.
BARBARA:
We'll move them.
No, don't touch them!
I feel terrible, sneezing at
a time like this.
This is a very important
moment for me.
He's allergic to everything,
don't worry about him.
Bees.
I'm allergic to bees.
Harold is allergic to
every type of bee.
We always have to
carry a hypodermic of
adrenalin wherever we go.
If he eats even one tiny
piece of a nut...
My head swells up
like a watermelon
and I drop dead.
IRENE:
It's the same with him and bees.
Your mother and I
had salmon
at our wedding.
I really think
a wedding without
cold salmon is--
I'm not allergic to salmon.
Oh, he's not allergic...
I don't think.
But you never know.
You never know.
Harold wasn't always allergic to bees.
BARBARA: Oh, honey,
what a shame.
We had some
champagne.
What did we use it for?
Uncle Milton's parole.
And it was delicious.
It was, wasn't it, Milton?
When are you getting married?
In early June, in the garden.
Oh...
What about Harold and bees?
I'm allergic to bees.
BARBARA:
We'll spray you.
Cold salmon, a lovely
cucumber salad,
strawberries.
I'm afraid I am allergic
to strawberries.
Is this all right with you?
Today, I'm consider myself
the luckiest man-man-man
on the face of the earth-earth-earth.
The Lou Gehrig line
from...
Remember, Dad,
the Lou Gehrig
line from, uh...
<i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>
<i>Pride of the Yankees.</i>
<i>Pride of the Yankees!</i>
Yeah. Yeah.
Baseball. It's baseball.
Historical reference.
I would like to propose
a toast.
ALL: Hear, hear.
To my kid sister.
To Walter
and my baby.
BARBARA:
To Walter
and Annie.
Everyone, please eat
before it gets cold.
Here it is. The Historical
Society wanted this
and I never would
give it to them.
ANNIE:
Oh, Mum...
BARBARA: I noticed these things
are back in fashion.
ANNIE:
Grandmother's dress.
He's a lovely man,
Annie.
I know he is
wonderful,
isn't he?
And he's such a wonderful athlete.
Are his folks nice?
You'll love them.
We're going down
to DC tonight to be with
them Christmas morning.
How did it happen?
It's silly, really.
I mean, I'd seen him
at the office.
Obviously I'd seen him.
He's the associate
publisher.
And then one day we
both ordered sandwiches
from the same place
and he got my lettuce
and tomato on whole wheat,
which, of course, he was allergic to.
And I got his lettuce
and tomato on white.
How amazing.
It is, isn't it?
You make a million
decisions that
mean nothing
and then one day
you order takeout
that changes your life.
Destiny takes a hand.
Mum, destiny is something
we've invented
because we can't stand
the fact that everything
that happens is accidental.
Then how do you explain
that you both ordered exactly
the same sandwich
except for the bread?
How many people
in this world
like lettuce and tomato
without something else,
like tuna?
Well, it wasn't a sign.
It was a coincidence.
I was in Atlantic City
with my family,
Cliff was a waiter.
He wasn't even supposed
to work that night.
Suppose he hadn't?
He asked me
to take a midnight walk
on the Steel Pier.
I probably told you this
a million times,
but I don't care.
Then he held
my hand.
At one point I looked down
and I couldn't tell which fingers
were his and which were mine.
And I knew.
What?
You know.
What?
Magic. It was magic.
Magic.
I knew we'd be together
forever. And that everything
would be wonderful.
Just the way you feel
about Walter.
Walter. It's quite
a formal name.
One of the things
I truly knew was that
your father and I
were going to have
a wonderful time in
the sack, I believe
you call it.
Mum.
Of course it took several
years before everything
worked like clockwork
in that department.
So don't be worried
if it takes a while.
We already...
Fine, fine. How's it working?
Like clockwork.
Oh, honey...
[ANNIE GASPS]
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
[ANNIE CHUCKLING]
They loved you. I told
you they would love you,
and they loved you.
I love you.
I love you, Walter.
Did anyone ever call you
anything other than Walter?
No.
Not even when you were young?
No, not even when I was young.
You sure you don't
want to drive with me?
Oh, how will I get back
to Baltimore on Friday?
I forgot the present. Walter,
I left your stepmother's
present inside by accident.
I swear, when we're
old and grey
you gonna have
to remind me
to put my teeth in.
I'll be walking all over
town smacking my gums
together, not even noticing.
I'll wait.
You'll wait? Oh, right.
No, don't wait, Walter.
Really, it's silly, you go ahead.
We're late anyway.
I'll be ten minutes
behind you.

<i>How old are you?</i>
JONAH:
<i>I'm 8.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Eight? How come you're up so late?</i>
JONAH:
<i>It's not that late in Seattle.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Oh, of course,</i>

<i>All right, what's your</i>

JONAH: <i>It's not for me, it's for my</i>

FIELDSTONE:
<i>You don't lik e the one he has now?</i>
JONAH:
<i>He doesn't have one now.</i>
<i>That's the problem.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Where's your mum?</i>
JONAH: <i>She died.</i>
FIELDSTONE: <i>Oh, I'm so sorry.</i>
Well, who can believe this?
JONAH: <i>I've been pretty sad,</i>

FIELDSTONE:
<i>Have you talk ed to your dad about it?</i>
JONAH: <i>No.</i>
FIELDSTONE: <i>Why not?</i>
JONAH:

JONAH:
<i>Not really, he's out on the deck.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>I'm sure that I can help.</i>
<i>But I'm gonna need you to help me...</i>
Wretched woman! Hang up, Jonah!

Hello.
<i>Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Fieldstone</i>

Okay. What are you
selling tonight?
Micro-hibachis or knives?
FIELDSTONE:
<i>No, I'm not selling anything.</i>
<i>I just wanna help.</i>
<i>I want you to know</i>
<i>that your son called</i>
<i>and he asked me for some advice</i>

Who is this?
<i>Dr. Marcia Fieldstone</i>

<i>And you are on the air.</i>
You called a radio station?
FIELDSTONE: <i>Sam, are you with me?</i>
Yeah. Yes.
<i>Your son feels that</i>
<i>since your wife's death</i>
<i>you've been very, very unhappy.</i>
<i>And he is genuinely</i>
<i>worried about you.</i>
Get out here. Get out here.
Come on, now, I'm not
gonna go through this alone.
<i>I think it's very hard for him</i>
<i>to talk to you about all this.</i>
<i>I thought maybe you and I</i>
<i>could talk, it would make Jonah</i>
<i>feel a little better. Sam?</i>
Talk to her, Dad. She's a doctor.
Of what?
Her first name
could be Doctor.
Please.
<i>Sam. Sam, it's his Christmas wish.</i>
Okay.
<i>Okay. Good.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Now, I know this is difficult.</i>
<i>But how long ago did your wife die?</i>
About a year and a half ago.
<i>Aw. Have you had any relationships?</i>
No.
<i>No? Why not?</i>
Uh, Marcia, or Dr. Fieldstone?
<i>Dr. Marcia.</i>
Dr. Marcia.
SAM: <i>I don't mean to be rude--</i>

FIELDSTONE:

We had a pretty tough time
at first.
But we're dealing with it.
And Jonah and I will
get along just fine again,

[FIELDSTONE LAUGHING]
FIELDSTONE: <i>I have no doubt that</i>

You certainly can.
<i>But something must be missing</i>
<i>if Jonah still feels</i>
<i>that you're under a cloud.</i>
<i>Just a few questions:</i>
<i>Are you sleeping at night?</i>
JONAH:
He doesn't sleep at all.
How do you know that?
I live here, Dad.
Look, it's Christmas.
Maggie, my wife.
She really did it...
I mean, she loved--
She made everything
beautiful.
<i>It's just tough this time of year.</i>
Every kid

Yes.

Harriet, shut up. Hi, can I help you?
Tea, with the bag out.
You know, maybe I'll just go

a little gift for New Year's Eve.
WAITRESS 2: Yeah, you go on
out there if you want to.
But don't open his refrigerator.
They don't cover
anything when they
put it in the fridge
they just stick it in
there and leave it

LORETTA: All I'm saying is
I wouldn't kick this guy
out of my bed for eating crackers.
You know what I'm saying?
Sixty five cents.
FIELDSTONE: <i>Let's take a call</i>

ALL: Ooh!
<i>Tennessee, you are on the air.</i>
WOMAN: <i>Yes, I would just like</i>

<i>get this man's address.</i>
Honey, get in line.
FIELDSTONE:
<i>If there was one question</i>
<i>I would love to ask...</i>
Oh, go ahead.
<i>People who truly loved once</i>
<i>are far more likely to love again.</i>
<i>Sam, do you think that there is</i>
<i>someone out there you could love</i>
<i>as much as your wife?</i>
Well, Dr. Marcia Fieldstone,
that's hard to imagine.
<i>What are you going to do?</i>
Well, I'm going to get
out of bed every morning
and breathe in
and out all day long.
<i>And after a while I won't</i>
<i>have to remind myself</i>
<i>to get out of bed every morning</i>
<i>and breathe in and out.</i>
And then after a while I won't

FIELDSTONE:
<i>Sam, tell me what was</i>
<i>so special about your wife.</i>
SAM:
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>
<i>Oh, well, it was a million</i>
<i>tiny, little things.</i>
<i>When you added them all up,</i>
<i>it just meant we were</i>
<i>supposed to be together.</i>
<i>And I knew it, I knew it</i>
<i>the very first time</i>

[RAY CHARLES'
"OVER THE RAINBOW" PLAYS]
MAN: This man sells the greatest
soup you've ever eaten, and he is
the meanest man in America.
I feel very strongly
about this, Becky.
It's not just about soup.
BECKY:
Do it. What else?
New Year's Eve.
Please don't
make me write it.
Listen to this: "Phone service
in the Chicago area was tied up
for two hours Christmas Eve
when some kid calls
a radio show and says that
his dad needs a new wife."
Two thousand women
called the station asking
for the guy's number.
I heard it. This kid
calls up and says,
"My dad needs a wife."
And the shrink practically forces
the guy and says,
"Do you want to talk about it."
And he says,
"No, as a matter of fact,
I don't."
And then suddenly
for no reason at all
he start to talk
about how much
he loved his wife
and how he just fell in love
with her like he was one
of those cows in Michigan.
What cows
in Michigan?
It was on <i>60 Minutes</i>
over those cows that got
zapped by stray voltage.
No one knows why.
And maybe it
was Wisconsin.
But, anyway, I was listening
to him talk about how much
he loved his wife
and suddenly
I was crying.
It's like what happens
when I watch those
phone company ads.
I don't have to see
the whole thing,
just the part
where the daughter gives
the mother the refrigerator
with the big red bow.
Yes. The Polaroid commercial,
two 5-year-olds at their
grandfather's birthday party.
They're making the album.
That kills me!
You should write
something about this.
About what?
Whatever it is.
I tell you what it is: Two thousand
women calling a radio station
for a husband?
There are a lot of desperate
women out there
looking for love.
Especially over
a certain age.
You know it's easier to be
killed by a terrorist than
it is to get married over 40.
That is not true.
That statistic is not true.
That's right, it's not true.
But it feels true.
It feels true
because it's true.
There is practically
a whole book about how
that statistic is not true.
Calm down, you brought it up.
I did not, Wyatt.
Did you even read
that book?
Did anybody read
that book all the way
through?
Are you two finished?
Fine, now where were we?
If someone's a widower,
why do they say
that he was he "widowed"?
Why don't they say
he was "widowered"?
I was just wondering.
BECKY:
What was that
about up there?
What was what?
What's with you?
ANNIE:
Nothing's with me.
BECKY:
Something's with you.
What are you saying?
Whatever it is, you can tell me.
Sleepless in Seattle?
That's what she called him
on the show because
he can't sleep.
And now 2000 women
want his number.
The guy could be a crackhead...
a transvestite,
a flasher, a junkie,
a chainsaw murderer
or someone really sick,
someone like my Rick.
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really?
Now we're getting down to it.
Please, Becky. I'm madly
in love with Walter. He did
the craziest thing the other night.
What was that?
Oh, it was so funny.
We were hysterical.
What was that?
[JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS]
You know, I was thinking,
I've gotta go to Boston
for the AAB convention, right?
And then I gotta visit

Why don't we meet
in New York
for Valentine's Day weekend.
Walter, I'd love to!
We can stay at the Plaza.

Sure, go ahead.

"Here's mud in your eye."
"Here's to us."
You used to say,
"Here's to us."
Oh, babe.
I miss you
so much it hurts.
What do you wanna do?
Tell him when he gets here.
You want to tell him?
You can tell him?
She's back.
She has another idea.
No, no, no.
I don't need this.
WOMAN: Sam, I'm so glad you're here.
How are you?
I heard you on the radio.
I told everyone about it.
We already knew.
How did you--?
Grace.
The dispatcher?
Yeah.
All of Seattle knows.
I was brushing my teeth
and, suddenly,
there you were.
I just couldn't believe
my ears. I called
my mother in Las Vegas.
I said, "Mother, turn on the radio.
That's my architect."
You know, it's so nice
when a man can
express his feelings.
It's wonderful.
I wish I could express my feelings.
So, Claire,
is there a problem?
I was tossing and turning
last night. You know
what that's like, Sam.
Because I realize
I'm never going
to fit my platters
in that refrigerator
we ordered.
And when I give parties,
I always put in platters.
So I thought
I would get the sub-zero
refrigerator instead.
And the only problem--
We have to redo all the cabinets.
We're gonna--
We'll be into this wall.
That's bearing wall.
SAM: That's a delay, Claire, of...
Two, three--
Five, six--
Twelve weeks.
I don't mind.
The important thing
is to get it right.
Absolutely.
Your words.
Oh, I've gotta rush.
<i>La décorateur</i> calls.
Bye.
Bye.
Well, this is fate.
She's divorced, we don't
wanna redo the cabinets
and you need a wife.
What do they call that,
when everything intersects?
The Bermuda Triangle.

MAN: And here's another one.
Do you got room
for one more here?
Here you go. Right there.
JONAH: Look at this, Dad.
They're all for you.
Yes, sir. Here you go.
"Sleepless in Seattle,"
c/o Dr. Marcia Fieldstone.
If you're having trouble
sleeping, you might
wanna try
drinking a glass of water
from the other side.
I thought that was for hiccups.
Does it work for hiccups?
For hiccups, take a spoonful
of sugar, hold it in
your mouth for a minute.
Really?
Thank you.
SAM: What possessed you
to give them our address?
They called and asked for it.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle
you are the most attractive man
I ever lay ears on."
Wait, wait.
They called?
How did they get our number?
Oh, let me guess.
You gave it to them.
You have to give them
your number or they
won't let you on the air.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle.
I live in Tulsa."
Where's that?
It's in Oklahoma.
You know where Oklahoma is?
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm not even gonna think
about what they're not
teaching you in school.
Yeah, somewhere in the middle.
And, generally speaking
we should rule out
anyone that doesn't
live near here.
She's willing
to fly anywhere.
She looks like
my third-grade teacher.
I hated my third-grade teacher.
Wait a minute.
She is my third-grade teacher!
Aren't you gonna read any of these?
No. This is not how it's done.
I'd much rather just see
somebody I like
and get a feeling about them,
ask them if they wanna
have a drink.
Or a slice of pizza?
Not dinner.
Not on the first date,
because halfway through dinner,
you could be really sorry.
Whereas, if it's just a drink
if you like them,
you can always
ask them to dinner.
If not, you can say,
"Well, that was great,"
and then you go home.
You see what I mean?
I wonder if it
still works this way.
It doesn't. They ask you.
I'm starting to notice that.
If you get a new wife,
I guess you'll have sex
with her, huh?
I certainly hope so.
Will she scratch up
your back?
What?
In movies, women always
scratch up the man's back
and screaming.
How do you know this?
Jed's got cable.
Hand me that towel
behind you.
Thank you.
I need it too.
Here, let me get you.
"Jed's got cable!"
Come on.

<i>all day long.</i>
<i>And then after a while,</i>
<i>I won't have to remind myself</i>
<i>to get out of bed every morning</i>
<i>and breathe in and out.</i>
<i>And then after a while,</i>
<i>I won't have to think about</i>
<i>how I had it great</i>
<i>and perfect for a while.</i>
FIELDSTONE: <i>Sam, tell me what was</i>
<i>so special about your wife?</i>
SAM:
<i>Well, how long is your program?</i>
<i>Oh, well, it was...</i>
<i>Oh, it was a million tiny,</i>
<i>little things.</i>
<i>When you added them all up</i>
<i>it just meant that we were</i>
<i>supposed to be together.</i>
<i>And I knew it.</i>
<i>I knew it the first time I touched her.</i>
<i>It was lik e coming home</i>
<i>only to no home I'd ever known.</i>
<i>was just taking her hand</i>
<i>to help her out of a car.</i>
<i>And I knew it.</i>
<i>It was like</i>
<i>magic.</i>
Well, I think I'm going
crazy, Dennis. I really do.
Are you happily married?
What?
I mean...
Why did you get married?
Was it trumpets
and fireworks?
I got married because Betsy
said we had to break up
or get married. So we got married.
But when you first
met her, did you believe
that she was the only person
for you, that in some mystical,
cosmic way
it was fated?
Annie,
when you're attracted
to someone, it means
your subconscious
is attracted to their subconscious,
subconsciously.
What we think of as fate
is just two neuroses
knowing they're a perfect match.
I don't even know him.
I'm having all of
these fantasies about
some man I've never even met,
who lives in Seattle!
It rains nine months
of the year in Seattle.
I know. I know.
I do not wanna move
to Seattle.
But what I really
don't wanna do
is end up always wondering
what might've happened
and knowing I could've done
something. What do you think?
It's just cold feet, isn't it?
Everybody panics
before they get married.
I mean, didn't you?
Yes, I did.
Yes, you did.
Thank you very much,
Dennis.
I feel so much better
just having blown this off.
Anytime.
Sandy has a girlfriend,
Glenda. She's a weightlifter.
Her neck isn't bigger than her head--
No, I'm not asking you to set me up.
I don't need your help
with that. I wanna know
what it's like out there.
That's what I'm trying to tell you
what women are looking for:
Pecs and a cute butt.
Like, "He has the cutest butt."
Yeah.
Where did I hear that recently?
Everywhere.
You can't even turn on the news
without hearing some babe
thought some guy's butt
was cute.
Who the first woman to
say this was, I don't know,
but somehow it caught on.
So how's my butt?
Not bad.
Really?
Yeah.
Is it cute though?
I don't know.
Are we grading
on a curve?
When was the last time
you were out there?
Uh... Uh, uh...
Jimmy Carter, 1978.
Things are a little
different now.
First, you have to be friends.
You have to like each other.
Then you neck.
This could go on for years.
Then you have tests,
then you get to do it
with a condom.
The good news is
you split the check.
I don't think I could let
a woman pay for dinner.
Great! They'll throw a parade
in your honour.
You'll be Man of the Year
in <i>Seattle Magazine.</i>
Tiramisu.
What is tiramisu?
You'll find out.
Well, what is it?
You'll see.
Some woman is gonna
want me to do it to her,
and I'm not gonna know.
You'll love it.
Oh, this is gonna be tough.
Tough, tough. It's gonna be
much tougher than I thought.
What about that decorator
on the Bennett job?
Victoria?
Yeah. She's perky.
Oh, no, I don't--
What?
I'm far away from that.
What? No.
I'm just assembling notes. I'm not--
Notes.
How would I do that?
What do you mean? Call her up.
You say, "Come,
let's get together.
We'll look at swatches."
Call her on the phone to say,
"Let's look at swatches"?
Yeah, you know, colour schemes.
She's not gonna see through that?
No, you don't do it
like I do it. You do it
in your own suave way.
Think Cary Grant.
Cary Grant would call up
and say, "Come over
and look at my swatches"?
How do you know?
Maybe he did.
He didn't do it in the movies.
<i>Gunga Din?</i>
He didn't call--?
<i>Gunga Din</i> is not
a swatch kind of movie.
Who knows what he did in real life.
He did that with Dyan Cannon?
Yeah, sure. "Hello, Dyan!
Take a look at these swatches."
Jonah, I'm home!
Hey, Jonah!
Jonah?
Hey, Jonah.
Hey, Jonah.
Hi, Dad.
This is Jessica.
Well, it's nice to
meet you, Jessica.
JONAH:
Dad, this is amazing.
If you play this backwards,
it says "Paul is dead."
Yeah, yeah. I know.
How do you know?
Dad, could you
shut the door?
Sure. Sure.
H and G.
Hi and goodbye.
[GENE AUTRY'S "BACK IN
THE SADDLE AGAIN" PLAYS]
Hello, Victoria?
[CLEARS THROAT]
This is Sam Baldwin.
I don't know if you
remember me, but--
Oh, great.
Hi.
I was wondering if, uh...
If you would like to have
a drink with me?
Dinner?
Dinner would be even better.
Friday would be great, yeah.
How--? I hear
that's a good place.
7:30 would be fine.
And I'll, uh...
Okay, I'll meet you there.
Okay. All right.
Um... So it's Friday
at 7:30 for dinner.
Great.
Me too. Bye.
[TYPEWRITER CLICKING]
<i>Are you in love with him?</i>
<i>I'm not now.</i>
Now those were the days
when people knew
how to be in love.
You're a basket case.
They knew it.
Time, distance,
nothing could separate them
because they knew.
It was right. It was real. It was--
It's a movie.
That's your problem.
You don't wanna be in love.
You wanna be love
in a movie.
Read it to me.
"Dear Sleepless and Son.
I've never written a letter
like this in my life--"
That's what everyone
writes at the beginning
of letters to strangers.
I know that.
You think I don't
know that?
What about Walter?
Oh, Walter.
Oh, I'd give anything
to marry Walter.
He's so unexpected.
You think you can tell
what he's like by just looking
at him, but you can't.
I should write something
in this about magic.
What?
Something! What if I never meet him?
What if this man is my destiny,
and I never meet him?
Your destiny
can be your doom.
Look at me and Rick.
"I want to meet you"--
GRANT:
<i>Top of the Empire State Building.</i>
On the top of the
Empire State Building.
Sunset, Valentine's Day.
I'll be in New
York with Walter.
I can squeeze it in.
I'll be in New York
with Walter!
Do you wanna hear
about destiny?
If I hadn't married Martin
I never would've bought
the house with
the dead tree.
On account of which
I got divorced.
On account of which
I hit a car and met Rick
while buying a neck brace.
Wait a minute. You never
told me you got a divorce
because of a dead tree?
The tree man.
You fell in love with the tree man?
I did not say "love."
Did I say "love"?
This is my favourite part.
<i>It's now or never.</i>
<i>Never is a frightening word.</i>
<i>We'd be fools to let</i>
<i>happiness pass us by.</i>
KERR:
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>Winter must be cold</i>
<i>for those with</i>
<i>no warm memories.</i>
<i>We've already missed the spring.</i>
GRANT: <i>Yes.</i>
Men never get this movie.
I know.
JONAH:
Mummy! Mummy!
Mummy!
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm coming.
Dad!
It's all right. It's okay.
It's okay.
Hey, it's all right.
It's okay.
What was that about, huh?
It was sinking.
What was?
Our house.
There was water coming in
all the windows.
Oh.
Well, it's okay now.
So, what should we do?
Your mother used to
sing to you when you
had bad dreams.
"Bye Bye Blackbird."
Yeah.
I miss her.
What do you think happens
to someone after they die?
I don't know.
Like, do you believe in heaven?
I never did.
Or the whole idea
of an afterlife.
But now, I don't know.
Because I have
these dreams
about your mum.
Yeah. And we have
long talks.
About you.
How you're doing.
Which she sort of knows,
but I tell her anyway.
So, what is that?
It's sort of an afterlife,
isn't it?
I'm starting to forget her.
She could peel an apple
in one long, curly strip.
The whole apple.
[JOE COCKER'S

I love you, Dad.

See you tomorrow.
<i>[PHONE BEEPING]</i>
Laurie?
Hi, it's Annie.
Fine, fine. I'm fine.
Listen, I'm doing an article
on call-in radio shows.
Do you know anyone who works
for someone named
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone?
I'm a writer for the <i>Baltimore Sun,</i>
and a friend of Laurie Johnson's.
I'm doing a piece on how people
handle bereavement.
And I understand you had
a caller the other night,
some guy from Seattle.
JONAH [ON MACHINE]:
<i>This is Jonah Baldwin.</i>
<i>We're not in right now, but you can--</i>
[###]
Architect.
Psst.
SAM: Okay, Clarise.
I'm gonna be back either by
midnight or 8:30,
if disaster strikes.
Here's one for the both of us.
"Sleepless and Son, Baltimore."
If there's any problem,
here's the number
to the paediatrician.
Here's a bottle of Ipecac
if anybody drinks poison.
It's right next to the juice glasses.
Fine.
How do I look?
Great.
Do I look okay? I look all right?
I look stupid. I
look stupid. I look like
I'm trying too hard.
I was gonna get a haircut,
but I'd just look like
I got a haircut.
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these are grotesque.
I look like I'm trying to be tall.
Her name is Annie Reed.
Now I'm late. Bye.
Dad, read this.
Read this!
"Sleepless and Son...
I've been an excellent
third baseman, and while
we're on it, let's just say right now:
Brooks Robinson
was the best
third-base men ever.
It's important you agree
with me on that because
I'm from Baltimore."
She thinks Brooks
Robinson is the greatest.
So do you.
Everyone thinks so.
It's a sign.
Come here.
I'll show you a sign.
Here's a sign.
All right.
Where's Seattle?
Right. Where
is Baltimore?
Ah! It's right there!
Look!
One, two, three.
There's, like, 26 states between
here and there. Now, that's a sign.
I'm out of here. Goodbye!
Good night! I love you.
Clarise, did you move
your car?
Huh?
Thank you, Derrick.
You're welcome.
I'll have--
White wine spritzer?
Yes.
And you, sir?
I'm fine. Thank you.
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
You look good yourself.
I thought you'd never call me.
You did?
I really wanted you to.
And I thought you were
never going to.
MAN: Excuse me, Mr. Baldwin?
Yes.
There's a phone call
for you.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Hello.
JONAH: <i>Dad, can we go to</i>
<i>New York City</i>
<i>for Valentine's Day?</i>
What?
<i>Annie Reed from Baltimore</i>
<i>wants to meet us at the top</i>
<i>of the Empire State Building</i>
<i>on Valentine's Day.</i>
Jonah?
<i>What?</i>
Have you fallen down?
Are you bleeding?
Is Clarise there?
Has she been strangled?
<i>No.</i>
This is the only reason for this call?
<i>If we book now,</i>
<i>we can get an excursion fare.</i>
<i>Jessica's parents are travel agents--</i>
I'm not having this conversation.
We'll talk about it
at a later time.
I can't believe
this conversation has lasted
this long. You go to bed.
Everything all right?
Oh, yeah.
Do you have kids?
No.
Do you want mine?
I'll have an Absolut
straight up, please.
[VICTORIA LAUGHING]
Hey, hey! Put that down.
Stop it!
There she is.
JONAH: Why is she bringing
those groceries?
She's gonna cook
us something
so be prepared.
Hi, Sam. Thanks.
Thanks. And let
me guess.
You must be Jonah.
Hi.
So this it?
Yeah.
The car's down this way.
Great.
She's on her sixth painter
and we are never going
to finish this job.
Now she wants
the fireplace rebricked.
I know her.
I could give her a call.
No, I've got it solved.
I'll just hit her with
one of those bricks.
[VICTORIA LAUGHING]
That's so funny.
You're so funny.
When she wants something
done she says, "Oh, I don't know.
I'm stupid. You know what's best.
But couldn't we flip the house
around so that everything in
the back is now in front?
And could the whole front
of the house open on a hinge
so I can get in with a garage opener."
"Yes, we can. We'll just--"
"Move the kitchen cabinets."
Hey, Jonah,
bring some of that stuff
around, all right?
Do you like baseball?
Yes, I do. In fact my firm
has box seats to the Mariners.
Why don't we all go some time.
What about camping?
What about it?
Do you like camping?
I went camping once.
You know, Dad, we should
start camping more often.
You're right.
Camping is good.
Time for bed.
It's only 10:00.
Yeah, 10:00. Time for bed.
Good night.
Hey, don't you wanna
thank Victoria for
this delicious dinner?
Thanks for dinner.
I never saw anybody
cook potatoes that way.
I'm glad you liked it.
Good night, Jonah.
Yeah, we don't see a lot
of potatoes around here.
We're rice men.

VICTORIA:
Oh, God.
[PHONE RINGING]
Oh! Oh!
Ow.
I'm sorry, Walter.
I'm sorry.
Hello.
BECKY: <i>Turn on your radio.</i>
What?
<i>The kid is on.</i>
<i>You've got me</i>
<i>listening to this garbage.</i>
<i>Go, turn it on.</i>
It's Becky. She's having
trouble with Rick again.
I'll go downstairs.
Becky, I'll call you back.
I'm sorry, Walter.
Are you bleeding?

JONAH:
<i>He's kissing her right this minute!</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Oh, really?</i>
<i>Jonah, tell the truth:</i>
<i>Are you spying on your father?</i>
Who is he kissing?
JONAH: <i>I have to make them stop.</i>
How will I explain this
to Walter?
JONAH:
<i>She came over and cook ed dinner.</i>
<i>She brought two bags of</i>
<i>groceries lik e she was</i>
<i>staying here for a year!</i>
FIELDSTONE: <i>Jonah, it's good</i>
<i>that your father's dating.</i>
<i>It's just hard on you.</i>
<i>It's something you think you want,</i>
<i>but then when it happens,</i>
<i>it scares you.</i>
JONAH:
<i>That's not true.</i>
FIELDSTONE:
<i>Okay, now think.</i>
<i>Shouldn't your father be</i>
<i>the judge of whether someone</i>
<i>is right or wrong for him?</i>
JONAH: <i>He's not sane enough</i>
<i>to judge anything.</i>
Now he's kissing her on the lips.
My dad's been captured by a ho!
What am I going to do?
FIELDSTONE: <i>Jonah, calm down.</i>
<i>Tomorrow, when you're</i>
<i>sitting down to breakfast</i>
<i>tell him how you feel.</i>
<i>It's not good to keep</i>
<i>your feelings inside you.</i>
Miss Scarlet.
In the broom closet.
With the radio.
Walter, you scared me.
Don't ever do that again.
I thought saw
a black widow spider.
You scared me to death.
You scared Victoria to death.
It was right over there.
Next time you think you see
a black widow spider
I want you to say:
"Dad, excuse me,
But I believe a poisonous insect
is in the house"
And I will calmly come
and take care of it. You scream
like that again, I'll kill you.
Becky heard this guy
on the radio, she was
sure it was Rick.
She was completely
hysterical.
And then it turned out
the guy lived in Duluth.
Where's Duluth?
That doesn't make any sense.
I know. I know, Walter.
It doesn't make any sense at all.
Thank God my life is in place.
Duluth? That's in North Dakota.
[###]
I love this letter.
You have to write to her.
You think so?
It's Y-O-H.
Yeah. What's that?
Your only hope.
[###]
I thought I would look into doing
a story on those radio shows.
You'd have to go somewhere
to really look into them.
Definitely.
Couldn't you do a phone interview?
Not for the kind of piece I wanna do.
I won't be in Chicago long.
When you get back, I'll be gone.
Then I'll see you in New York.
I'll get it.
PILOT [OVER PA]:
<i>This is Captain Browning.</i>
<i>We're cruising at 35,000 feet.</i>
<i>The weather is clear to the west</i>
<i>and we'll be in Seattle on schedule.</i>
Don't you hate flying?
Yes, I do.
And I've just told the most terrible
one to the man I'm about to marry.
Do you feel that
any lie is a betrayal?
I said flying.
Oh.
[SIGHS]
Thanks for bringing me here.
Well, he likes the planes.
Can I bring something
back for you? A souvenir?
Does he like those
little snow globes?
You know, you shake them up
and then the snow floats down.
Sure, I'd really like that.
Thank you so much.
He's 8.
He's good at it.
I've read an article about
this. Children are hideous
at the age of 8.
It's quite normal.
Well...
Maybe when I come
back, the two of us
ought to spend some time
together on our own.
What do you think?
Bye. Bye, Jonah.
Bye.
Jonah.
Listen to me.
You don't know Victoria.
I hardly know her myself.
She's, in fact, a mystery to me.
She tosses her hair a lot.
Why does she do this?
I have no idea.
Is it a twitch?
Does she need a haircut?
Could she use a barrette
to keep her hair out of her face?
These are the things I'm
willing to get to the bottom of.
That is why I am dating her.
That's all I'm doing.
I'm not living with her.
I'm not marrying her.
Can you appreciate
the difference?
This is what single people do.
They try other people on
and see how they fit.
But everybody's an adjustment.
Nobody's perfect.
There's no such thing as a perfect--
[###]
Come on.
Dad, I was talking to
Jessica about reincarnation.
She says you knew
Annie in another life.
Who's Annie?
The one who wrote us.
But Jessica says, you and Annie
never got together in that life.
So your hearts are like
puzzles with missing pieces.
And when you get together,
the puzzle's complete.
Goddamn it.
The reason I know this
and you don't,
is because I'm younger and
pure, so I'm more in touch
with cosmic forces.
Who told you this stuff?
Jessica.
I sincerely hope you're
not marrying Jessica.

That's not what I mean.
I'm going back over

It's so good to see you.
Where's Greg?
[HORN HONKING]
[###]
Hello.
Hello.
[HORN HONKING]
BECKY: <i>So then what happened?</i>
ANNIE: <i>So then I left, obviously.</i>
You were standing in
the middle of the street?
You know that dream when you're
walking down the street naked
and everyone is looking at you.
I love that dream.
That was nothing compared
to this humiliation. Nothing!
But he saw you, right?
He saw me.
You were face to face.
He said hello.
He said hello.
And what did you say.
And all I could say was hello.
Oh, my God.
KERR: <i>All I could say was hello.</i>
It's a sign.
It's a sign that I have watched
this movie too many times.
So stupid! From the minute
I listened to that stupid program
on the radio,
I've been a complete jerk.
You are not a jerk.
Thank you. An idiot!
You don't know who she was, Annie.
I saw her. I have a picture of her.
I'll show you a picture of her.
That detective in Seattle
sent me a picture of her.
Here! See, that's
exactly what she looks like.
This is a picture
of someone's back.
Well, it's her and he
was crazy about her.
What's this?
This is from Seattle.
Becky.
So I mailed your letter.
"Dear Annie.
Thanks for your letter.
It was great.
You sound neat.
We're very excited about meeting
you in New York on Valentine's Day
and seeing if we are...
M-F-E-O.
See you soon.
Sleepless in Seattle."
M-F-E-O?
Made for each other.
It's cute. It's like a little clue.
[SCREAMS]
So he can't write. Big deal.
Verbal ability is a highly
overrated thing in a guy.
And our pathetic need
for it is what gets us
into so much trouble.
I'm going to run back
to Walter's arms,
if he'll still have me.
What about the letter?
It's nothing. It was written before
I went out there. Before the ho.
The only thing is,
she didn't look like a ho.
She looked like
somebody we would
have been friends with.
You saw her in the airport
and then here?
And I tried to talk to her.
It was like I knew her
or something. It was weird.
You mean like a <i>déjá-vu</i> thing?
It was very French <i>déjá-vu-ish</i>
kind of thing. <i>Oui?</i>
At least you're out there seeing
people again. That's terrific.
Well, I mean, there's
really just the one.
Victoria.
You don't like Victoria?
She laughs like a hyena.
Is this true?
No!
Sort of. Yeah, a little bit.
But, tell them what you did.
Dad--
Tell them about the radio show.
Go ahead.
Dad--
They wanna hear it.
Go ahead. Tell them.
Tell them.
Christmas Eve, he phones in
one of those radio call-in shows.
And tells them I need a new wife.
Oh, you're kidding.
That's so sweet.
Now he's obsessed with
this one woman who wrote me.
Are you serious?
Yeah.
She wants to meet me
at the top of Empire
State Building.
On Valentine's Day.
It's like that movie.
What movie?
<i>An Affair to Remember.</i>
Did you ever see it?
Oh, God. Cary Grant
and Deborah Kerr.
Is that "Karr" or "Kerr"?
Kerr.
Karr.
Okay. She's gonna meet him
at the top of the Empire
State Building.
Only she got hit by a taxi.
And he waited and waited.
And it was raining, I think.
And then she's too proud
to tell him that she's...
crippled. And he's too proud
to find out why she doesn't come.
But he comes to see her anyway.
And I forget why, but...
Oh, it's so amazing
when he comes to see her.
Because he doesn't even notice
that she doesn't get up to say hello.
And he's very bitter.
You think he's just going
to walk out the door
and never know why.
She's just lying there, you know.
Like, on the couch with this
blanket over her shrivelled
little legs.
And...
Are you all right?
She's fine.
And suddenly, he goes,
"I saw the painting,"
And he, like, goes to the bedroom.
And he looks, and he comes
out and looks at her.
And he kind of just...
They know and hug and it's so...
That's a chick's movie.
I would say so.
What kind of a person would write
to someone they heard on the radio?
I got hundreds of letters
from women all over the country.
Desperate women.
Just because someone is looking
for a nice guy, it doesn't make
them desperate.
How about rapacious
and love-starved?
No.
It's easier to be killed
by a terrorist than to
find a husband
after the age of 40--
That is absolutely untrue!
Right, honey. Right.
Well, I'm not looking
for a mail-order bride.
I just want somebody
that I can have a decent
conversation with over dinner.
You know, without it falling down
into weepy tears over some movie
that she just saw.
She's very emotional.
Although, I cried at the
end of <i>The Dirty Dozen</i>.
Well, who didn't?
Jim Brown was throwing
these hand grenades
down these air shafts.
And Richard Jaeckel and
Lee Marvin we sitting on top
of this armoured personnel carrier.
They were dressed up like Nazis.
And it was...
Trini Lopez...
Trini Lopez...
He busted his neck when
they were parachuting down
behind the Nazi lines.
Stop it!
Richard Jaeckel, at the beginning,
he had on a shiny helmet,
because he was an MP.
Please, no more.
God, I love that movie.
[MUSIC PLAYS ON TV]
This is the best movie
I've ever seen in my life.
What's so great about it?
You have to find her, Jonah.
You have to go to her.
Do you know how much money
it costs to go to New York?
Nobody knows.
It changes practically every day.
How much money do you have?
80 dollars.
I have 42. That'll probably cover cabs.
But how would I get there?
Honey, I have to run these
tickets over to someone.
Can you keep an eye on things
out front till I get back?
Sure, Mum.
You want a window seat or aisle?
Window.
You want a fruit plate?
I don't know. Do I?
I'd rather die than
eat airplane food.
I'm telling them you're 12
so you can fly unaccompanied
and the stewardess
won't carry you around
and stuff like that.
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe I'm 12?
If it's in the computer,
they'll believe anything.
Are you sure?
Do you want me to say that you're
really, really short for your age,
and they shouldn't say anything
because it would hurt your feelings?
Yeah. That's a great idea!
[TAMMY WYNETTE'S

Walter.
You're gonna miss the train.
No, I'm not.
I'm so happy, Becky.
Finally, I feel happy.
This is right. This is real.
Everything else is what happens
when you watch too many movies.
And you completely lose
sight of what counts.
Please, don't tell
anybody what happened.
Because I would be so
absolutely mortified if
anyone knew I did anything
even remotely close
to what I have done.
Thank you, thank you.
Do you promise?
I promise.
Sleepless in Seattle is history.
I was just--
I was just--
Go ahead.
No, you go.
Okay. Well, I was just gonna
say that ever since Christmas...
you've been different,
kind of distracted, distant.
But now it feels as if
you're coming back
from wherever you were.
I am.
I was just--
I just-- I just got--
I think I got nervous.
But that's normal, right?
I mean, don't you ever
feel nervous about...you know?
About what?
Forever.
No.
Well...
I did.
And... You know what
I think? I think I thought
it was too perfect, you know.
I started to wonder if
we were the human equivalent
of two rights making a wrong.
You know what it was?
It was like kismet, but not,
if you see what I mean.
You have to grow up.
You just can't keep
having all these adolescent
fantasies about...
how exciting life is gonna be.
Don't hate me,
but I love this pattern.
You couldn't.
I do.
This is just like my
grandmother's china.
How many place settings?
Ten.
Ten.
[CHUCKLES]
Exactly. Eight is too few,
twelve is too many.
Walter.
It was my mother's.
I had them size it down.
She had really fat fingers.
It's so beautiful.
It's exactly what I'd pick out
if I had every ring in the whole
world to choose from.
You see what I mean?
There are people who
would like a relationship
to be full of surprises,
but I am not one
of those people.
No, siree.
Surprises are highly overrated.
I'm leaving first thing
in the morning,
but I'm only gonna
be gone one night.
Clarise is gonna be here.
So you'll be able to see plenty of
<i>Geraldo</i> and <i>Nightmare on Elm Street 12.</i>
I will never know.
Are you going with her?
I'm going with Victoria, yes.
Don't try anything tricky.
Understand?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Don't go rolling in poison ivy
as soon as I leave the house.
Or lock yourself in the closet
or do anything that makes
you need stitches.
If your finger falls off,
it's staying off.
No one's gonna pack it on
ice and take you to hospital,
so that you can be a
breakthrough in laser surgery.
Is this about that
woman in Baltimore?
Annie.
I don't care what you do!
Good! Fine!
I'll tell you what I'm
doing this weekend.
I'm getting laid.
1990s and nobody's getting laid.
I'm the only man
in the America who's getting
laid this weekend.
And I haven't been laid that much.
Six girls in college. Maybe seven.
How long have you been there?
Forever.
What did you
hear me just say?
"Six girls in college.
Maybe seven."
Seven. Eight!
Mary Kelly.
This is the one I like.
Jonah, the fact is, you're
not gonna like any woman,
because it isn't your mother.
How do you know?
What's wrong with Annie?
Oh, Jonah, shut up!
Shut up? Shut up? Mum
never said shut up to me.
Mum never yelled at me.
This conversation is finished.
Why can't we go to New York?
There is no way that
we are going on a plane
to meet some woman
who could be a crazy,
sick lunatic.
Didn't you see <i>Fatal Attraction?</i>
You wouldn't let me.
Well, I saw it!
And it scared the shit out of me.
It scared the shit out
of every man in America!
I'm not leaving till
you say yes.
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!
That's good!
You'll have a lot to tell Oprah
how your dad
destroyed your life
because he had to go off for a
weekend special at the Holiday Inn!
[KNOCKING]
Jonah, Clarise is here
and I've got to go.
Hey, Jonah.
Jonah?
All right. Jonah, listen,
I've got to go.
Jonah.
Jonah.
Hey, Jonah.
Jonah!
Jonah!
Jonah!
Jessica, honey.
You have tell us where he is.
Jonah's daddy is very upset.
Jessica, this is your father.
Tell us where he is.
Right this minute!
N-Y.
What is that?
"No way."
That's N-W!
New York. He's on
his way to New York.
What?
How?
United, 597.
JESSICA'S MOTHER: Jessica.
When does it leave?
Seven thirty.
[CUCKOO CLOCK CHIMES]
[###]
Here you go.
Here's a nice pin for you
for flying with us.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Can I take this for you?
No.
Where to, kid?
Empire State Building.
Hold on.
Empire State Building.
Get a little further away
from the curb next time, mac.
There it is. What are you going
to do up there? Spit off the top?
No, I'm going to meet
my new mother.
Excuse me. I'm Jonah.
Are you Annie?
No, I'm Cynthia.
Excuse me, are you Annie?
Great table. Thanks.
Is something wrong?
Can I get you a drink?
Some champagne?
Fine. Fine.
Can we have a bottle
of Dom DeLuise.
[CHUCKLING]
Just kidding.
It was a joke.
He meant Dom Perignon.
I got it.
Beautiful view.
Walter...
There's something
I have to tell you.
[###]
Hey! Sorry, I have an emergency.
[SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY]
SAM:
Money, money, money, see?
[###]
So he could be on top of
the Empire State Building now?
No. I guess he could be. No.
It's not him, Walter. It's me.
I can't do this.
Look, Annie, I love you.
But let's leave that out of this.
I don't want to be someone
that you're settling for.
I don't want to be someone
that anyone settles for.
Marriage is hard enough
without bringing such low
expectations into it.
Isn't it?
Walter, I don't deserve you.
No, I wouldn't put it that way.
But okay.
You okay?
Yeah.
[SIGHS]
[GASPS]
What?
Look.
[###]
It's a sign.
Who needed a sign?
Walter, I have to go.
[SIREN WAILING]
[WHISTLES]
Jonah!
Jonah!
Dad! Dad!
Jonah?
What if something happened to you?
What if I couldn't get to you?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
What would I have done?
You are my family.
You're all I've got.
I thought she'd be here.
I thought she'd come.
We're doing okay, aren't we?
I mean, are we okay?
Aren't we all right?
So far, have I done
anything stupid?
No.
Have I screwed it up
for the both of us?
No.
[HORNS HONKING]
[###]
Observation deck?
Sorry, ma'am, but it's too late.
No, please.
I really need to get up there.
We're closing up.
No more runs tonight.
Listen...
can I just take a look?
There's someone
I was supposed to meet.
He's probably not there,
but if I don't at least look,
I'll always wonder about it.
Cary Grant, right?
You know that movie?
It's one of my wife's favourites.
Maybe when we get home,
we'll get a dog.
Okay.
What do you mean, okay?
Wouldn't you like to have a dog?
JONAH: Sure.
I'm sorry, ma'am. Empty.
Can I take a minute?
Go ahead.
[###]
I left it by the telescopes.
It's you.
It's me.
I saw you in the street.
Are you Annie?
Yes.
You're Annie?
This must be yours.
I'm Jonah.
This is my dad.
His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah.
Sam.
And who's this?
Howard.
Oh, Howard. Hello, Howard.
[GU ARD CLEARING THROAT]
We'd better go.
Shall we?
