Cheers, mate.
Yo.
Hey, Elvis. You've seen D?
I'm not looking for D.
You on the dollies again?
Do you see a welcome sign
over my head?
Go away, Baz.
Brass monkeys, man.
Where are you crashing tonight?
No, seriously. You've seen D?
Seriously, I'm on the script.
I mean it this time.
Yeah, who doesn't?
Well, tell D I'm looking for him, yeah?
Three quid, mate.
Eighty and two...
...four, six, eight, ten...
You're short.
It's all I've got.
It's three quid, mate.
Come on, I've barely eaten all day.
It's three quid.
- Can you let me off 9p?
- No!
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll play you a little song, yeah?
How about that?
Play you a little song...
...and you let me off 9p, okay?
All right.
- Thanks, mate. That's great.
- Don't come back.
- Okay.
- Don't want you here. Go on!
All right! Okay, I'm going.
Thanks a lot.
Get out of here!
Sorry, sorry.
Yo, Elvis. Get in.
- Whose is it?
- The bloke who forgot to lock it.
I found D.
Have some.
Hey! I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
No, no, no.
That's nice, that's nice.
- You don't have to do this.
- Yes, I do. You're late.
- Who are these?
- I don't know. It's your car!
How long have they been here? Hey!
What are you doing in my car?
You didn't knock on the door?
- Why should I?
- James.
James!
James! James, come on, wake up.
- You can't do this! Not now!
- Did you see them get in?
- Do I look like a genie?
- From a certain angle.
Hey! What? Come back here!
- Get after him, will you? Hey.
- This isn't Batman and Robin, you know.
- Hey.
- Pay for the ticket and move.
Wake up. You're in my car. Hey.
Wait, he's...
He's not moving.
Did they bring my guitar?
Nice to see you, too.
Sorry, I'm not exactly myself
this morning.
That's a matter of opinion.
- They brought it to me.
- To you?
Well, it isn't our first time
at this circus, is it?
I'm sorry.
I know I made a mistake.
I messed up.
Tell me something I haven't
already heard 20 times today.
Good.
I prefer the sound of silence
to bullshit.
How do you feel?
Like death.
Look at me, I'm...
It's horrible.
Turns out you've also got hepatitis.
Congratulations.
Ever wonder why you see so many
old alkies, never junkies?
You're all full of good news
this morning, aren't you?
You can't mix heroin with methadone.
You OD. You know this stuff.
- Yeah.
- Do it again, and you'll probably die.
I know. Look, l...
- I'm sorry--
- Silence over bullshit.
Right.
- I'll see you when you're discharged.
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Did you nick an orderly's uniform?
No, I didn't nick it.
A nurse gave it to me
because they lost my T-shirt.
Right.
You know the drill. Sign that one...
...and take that one to the chemist
every day for your methadone.
Check in with me every two weeks.
And addicts who stop the methadone
and go back to heroin...
-...have a higher percentage of ODing.
- Of ODing. Yeah, I know this already.
It's my job to tell you.
Fall off methadone...
...and it's more likely you'll OD
the next time you do heroin.
And you could well die.
Yeah.
Is there anyone I can call?
Any relative anywhere?
I'm kind of solo these days.
No word from your dad?
Or mum?
Yeah.
"Get lost."
- I guess that's two words.
- Here you go.
Thank you.
You're gonna play something for me?
You wanna hear me sing?
Are you any good?
Okay.
Here you are, mate.
Hey, get moving.
Come on, on your way.
I wouldn't be begging you
if it wasn't a special case.
Special?
I've got three single mums
waiting for a spot.
I've got a sweet old pensioner
getting kicked out of his son's house.
They all need emergency housing.
They're all special.
Please.
What's so special about a drug addict?
Why this one?
I don't know.
Every now and then, one comes along...
...and you just know
they have it in them to be clean.
I think this is his last shot.
He really wants to be clean,
but he's got nothing.
No support system at all.
I have to get him off the street,
or I'm gonna lose him.
No. I'm not giving a spot to a user.
- He's in the program.
- He falls off methadone, he's out.
- Period.
- He won't.
I hope.
Come on, everybody.
Come on, then. Albert, this side.
- Val?
- Hey. Come in.
Welcome home.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
It was a little bit stuffy,
so I just opened a window.
Hot water.
Look, I've gotta run.
- Keys.
- Right, yeah.
Val, l...
You're welcome.
And I put some cereal in the kitchen
and milk in the fridge.
I don't know what to say.
Say you're gonna stay in the program
and you won't miss our next meeting.
I promise. I promise you.
Cross my heart, hope to die.
Okay.
I'll see you out.
Whoever's there, you better leave!
I mean it!
I've got a weapon here!
I'm seriously armed!
That was you making all that noise?
How did you get--
I see.
You're a thief, are you?
Stealing all my corn flakes?
Hey, are you friendly?
Guess that answers that.
No. Come on. This way.
There you go.
They're better with
a bit of milk, actually.
I'm gonna get this out.
You're not a very good thief,
by the way.
Next time, try and be a bit quieter.
That's the trick, I hear.
Come on.
Up you come. Look.
Look at that.
There's gonna be a family
worried about you.
You'd better go home now.
No,no,no.
This way.
I know. But I think it's time,
you'd better go home.
Hey, no, this way. There you go.
Go on. Go out there.
That's it. Go on.
No, don't look at me like that, okay?
All right, then.
One night, okay?
And then I'm gonna
take you back to your owner.
Yeah, deal?
There you go.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Over there?
Excuse me.
Did you lose a cat?
Is it there?
No?
Excuse me?
Did you lose a cat?
Hello?
I've got a little ginger cat down here,
if anyone's looking for it.
Hello?
So, what number life are you on?
Apparently, I'm on my ninth.
Hello, did anybody lose a cat?
- Get out of here! Go away!
- Thanks.
Come on.
There you go.
Someone will come looking for you.
Take care of yourself.
Thank you.
- Hi.
- Methadone, right?
Thank you, mate.
Not you again. Oi!
- Come on, on your way.
- Don't do this, mate.
You know the rules.
You're causing an obstruction.
I'm just trying to make a living here.
I'm not in anyone's way.
It's an health and safety issue.
If you stand there,
you're obstructing the exit.
Well, if you stand there, you are.
- One toot on this, they'll haul you away.
- Right.
- If it was up to me, I'd arrest the lot of you.
- I'm sure you would.
Flippin' vermin.
As if we haven't got enough to do.
Dad? Dad.
Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?
We're...
A little bit of shopping. This and that.
- Oh, yeah.
- You good?
Yeah. I've stopped using.
- I'm in the program.
- Again?
It won't be like last time.
-I've got my own flat now, and everything.
- Jack.
- You remember Hilary.
- Hi.
We're late, darling.
I'm sorry, we've got to...-...
We were just chatting
about Christmas, actually.
Family and all that. Coming together.
Christmas dinner. Right, Dad?
Well, I wish we'd known.
Unfortunately, our table's full.
Always room
for one more at Christmas. Right?
Don't you think, darling?
Maybe one more would...
What, in our house?
We'll have children there.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Jack, we're late. Come on.
I'm not contagious, you know.
Take this.
- No, I don't want your money.
- Here.
Maybe...
Maybe New Year's, okay?
Darling. Hold up.
Hey, wait up.
Yeah.
Hey, mate.
Hey, boy.
It's okay.
You're hurt.
What have you been doing today?
Have you been in a fight?
Is it okay if I take you
and try and find your owner?
Is that okay?
It's okay.
Here, down here?
Excuse me.
Do you know whose cat this is?
Wait, I have a hurt cat here.
It's you, with the dogs.
Yeah, it's just in there.
What did you do to it?
Me? I didn't do anything.
I just found him over there.
Don't just stand there.
It's all right.
- It's okay, it's okay.
- There you go.
There we go.
Yeah, it might be purulent.
- It might be what?
- The wound.
He needs antibiotics before it's infected.
Maybe they can glue it together.
He needs a vet.
That sounds expensive.
Can you put a price on love?
No, no. He's not my cat.
I just found him.
I think he's a stray or...
- I don't know.
- Well...
He is telling me
he was put hereto be with you.
Reading his spirit loud and clear.
He came to you for a reason.
Really? You're sensing that?
Of course not. What do I look like,
some kind of nut?
There's a card there
for the vet that I volunteer at.
It's a charity.
- Tell them Betty sent you.
- Okay, thanks.
And you are?
Me? I'm James.
James Bowen.
I don't believe in last names.
Patriarchal burdens.
I gotta go. I've got dogs to walk.
Right, yeah.
Okay, mate. It's all right.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Allergic. Animals.
-Ironic, huh?
- Yeah.
You should go.
Bacteria's multiplying by the second...
...and Bob needs a vet.
Bob?
That's what he told me
he wants you to call him.
It's okay.
He's not actually my cat, you know.
Mine, yours.
We all belong to each other.
See you, Bob!
It was nice to meet you.
You're a bit of an attention hog.
Do you know that, Bob?
It's okay. I got you.
Hi there.
I just found this cat,
and he's hurt himself.
A stray?
I don't know.
- Are you asking us to put him down?
- What? No.
You know how many stray cats
are in London? It's an epidemic.
Well, he's got a name. It's Bob.
And the wound, it's purulent.
Take a number.
It's gonna be a long wait.
I've gotta be somewhere.
Can't I drop him off and come back?
Does this look like a dry-cleaner's?
Okay, okay-
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
Look. It's a rabbit.
No,no,no.
Don't look at the rabbit.
The rabbit's not for dinner, okay?
Don't worry about him, Bob.
It's okay.
Bob, look, it's the month of the cat.
Yeah.
That's the kind of hat for you, isn't it?
Look at Tiffany. She looks cute.
Who's that? Look at that one.
Lucky. Look at Lucky.
Doesn't look so lucky, does he?
I've missed my appointment.
Val's gonna kill me.
I can't miss rush-hour busking.
I've gotta go, all right?
I'll have to come back tomorrow.
Number 62 is up.
It's okay. It's okay.
Hi.
- He did great.
- You okay?
Yeah? Come on, then, mister.
In you get.
- That's it. Good boy.
- Okay.
- You get your pills from the front desk.
- Okay.
22 pounds.
I thought she said
this place was free.
Not the drugs.
Sorry, mate.
Hang on.
That's all I've got.
Come on, he's really sick.
All right, wait.
- This is my food money for the next week.
- It's up to you.
Right. Come on, Bob.
Time for your medicine.
This is gonna make you feel better.
Look, what's that? Yeah, exactly.
All right, ready?
Open wide.
No, no, no, no. Come here.
Bob, look.
Yeah. Just down the hatch, mate.
Oi. Come back here, mister.
Come here.
Come here, oi. Hey.
No,Bob.
Bob!
Right. Okay.
Bob. Treat.
Right, mister.
Let's try this again.
Twice a day for two weeks, they said.
No, come here.
All right.
No, no, no. Stay here, stay here.
Stay here. Bob, Bob, Bob.
Oi! Come here, come here.
Wait, come here.
Look, what's that?
What's that? What's that?
What's that? What's that?
Bob!
It's all right, mate. It's okay.
I know.
I swear he wasn't like this earlier.
Well, I've had practice.
Did they tell you to bring him back
in a couple of weeks?
Yeah, that'll be a good time
to get him snipped.
-"Snipped"?
- Yeah, the man parts.
- But, I mean...
- Please, it isn't a big deal.
It's easy for you to say.
Besides, he's not even mine.
An intact male alone on the streets,
it's the worst life imaginable.
They fight for food,
they fight for territory.
Don't need to imagine that, do we?
If you can't give him a home,
at least give him a chance to stay alive.
Now, ordinarily, I don't touch meat...
...but Bob's gonna need some protein.
What do you do?
How did you end up here?
- Me?
- Well, I know what he does.
- What have you got there?
- Allergy pill.
Right. I thought...
Otherwise, I am 100 percent anti-drug.
Lot of addicts in here.
I steer clear.
So, what do you do?
How did you end up here?
I'm a musician.
- I write songs and play.
- Yeah?
I haven't exactly been discovered yet...
...but I just moved in here, which is good.
From... Australia.
I've actually been back a while.
I've been sort of in between places,
I guess you could say.
But no, I got taken out there when
I was a kid when my parents split up.
And my mum took me out there,
and Dad stayed here.
He had his business to run...
-...and didn't like flying, apparently.
- And you?
<i>Well...</i>
...she bought me a kitten, actually.
Dad, kitten. Kitten, Dad.
You must have missed him.
My dad?
It's a long story.
Long story, eh?
Val, I'm so sorry I missed our time.
Honestly, I tried to get there.
There were things...
- There was this cat, right?
- We have an agreement.
- You miss your appointment, you're out.
- And I met this girl, Betty.
I'm waiting for the part that explains
why you missed our appointment.
Is that blood on your coat?
- Must be Bob's.
- Who's Bob?
Bob's my cat I'm telling you about.
Well, not really mine.
- Betty's?
- No.
Betty's allergic.
But she told me to take him to the vet.
You seem a little rattled.
I'm trying to explain to you
why I missed our appointment.
Bob was hurt. He needed a vet.
- It took forever.
- How'd you pay for the vet?
My dad gave me some money.
You saw your dad?
Yeah. Bumped into him.
It didn't go very well.
This Betty...
...does she use?
No.
I put myself on the line for you.
- I know.
- Did you tell her you're in the program?
- I told her I was a musician.
- So you didn't tell her the truth.
<i>Well...</i>
...you've covered a lot of ground
since I last saw you.
- You can't take on too much too fast.
- Because I'm an emotional wreck?
Because feelings
aren't an addict's friend.
Bad, good, any feelings.
When was the last time
you were totally sober?
No weed, no brown, nothing.
When my parents split up, and I was...
You just couldn't deal with
your emotions.
Emotions are still dangerous.
It's baby steps, James.
You're not ready for a relationship.
Another one?
You wanna go up high?
Wanna go up high?
Go on, Bob.
Good boy.
You've got your strength back.
<i>He'! -</i>
Here he is.
Look at your collar.
Look at you. You're like
Shakespeare or something.
He's a little drowsy,
but the castration went well.
Please, don't even say the word.
I think he understands English.
Here you go.
It's okay. Does he hurt down there?
You big wally.
Do you know how many cats
we castrate every. . ..
Perform the procedure on?
He won't even remember.
Will you, Bob?
Yeah, I don't know about that.
You know, I was thinking, is he too thin?
You're keeping him, aren't you?
Well, I'd like to...
...but I can't. It wouldn't
be fair to him, would it?
Keep him cooped up all day?
He's a street cat.
His weight's fine.
He should be good to go in a week.
Okay.
Thank you.
Oi. I know, I know.
No, don't look at me like that.
It's for your own good.
Hey. It wasn't my idea.
You can take it up with Betty.
Okay, look.
I'll take that off if you promise
not to lick the stitches.
Okay?
Right. No, it's okay.
Now, you hold still there, okay?
Okay, Bob.
Let me just take this off.
Okay, that's it.
That is a good boy.
Okay, here we go. There you go.
Hey, look at this.
Come on.
See, there you go.
Yeah, I'm your hero now.
You wait till you realize
you've got no bits left.
Morning, mate.
No,no,no,Bob!
Bob, Bob, Bob. No.
naughty-
Do I not feed you enough?
You only eat what I give you, yeah?
Not the neighbors.
And you...
...don't come back.
No, look, Bob. Bob.
I've gotta go to work, all right?
I can't take care of you.
I wish I could...
...but I can't.
Look at the big world out there
waiting for you.
Go and explore it.
That's it. Good boy.
So long, Bob.
Come on. This is silly now.
What did I just say?
You're gonna get yourself run over-.
Hey, it's not safe out here.
I mean it.
You can't come with me.
Seriously, you'd be surprised
how much he understands.
Hey, Bob.
Go on, go back to the grass.
Go on. Good boy.
Good boy.
Darling, look.
What are you doing here?
Hey, no, don't go over there.
He's not even my cat.
He's just followed me onto the bus.
Haven't you, eh?
- Isn't he lovely?
-ls it okay that he's on here?
- I don't know. Have you paid for him?
- Two for one?
Hey, do you wanna go up here?
There you go.
That's a good view.
Yeah.
What are you doing,
following me into town, hey?
Hey, Bob, look.
Look at those, eh?
Yeah, you're a lion. You're a lion.
Yeah.
They've got nothing on you, mate.
- Here. Would this help, love?
- That's perfect.
- That's good. It's a bit thicker.
- Yeah.
- Not too tight, now.
- No, I know.
It's just if he gets spooked in town.
I don't want him to run off.
He's not actually mine. He's a stray.
- He doesn't look like a stray to me.
- Yeah, I know.
Good boy.
Come on.
Come on, Bob. This way.
We won't make any money here, mate.
Come on, this way.
Good boy.
On we go.
Bob, Bob, Bob!
Sorry.
Good boy. That's enough shopping
for one day.
Bob. Come on.
Come on.
I'll tell you what.
You jump up here, okay?
We haven't got all day. Come on.
Good boy.
Is that better up there?
This is Covent Garden.
You okay, Bob?
Look at his cat!
- I could eat you up!
- She doesn't mean it.
He's gorgeous.
Thank you.
Look at that.
I'd like to see you do that.
- Hey!
- Hi.
- Can I have a photo?
- Yeah, okay. Sure.
Say cheese, Bob.
- All right?
- Thanks!
You're quite the little party piece,
aren't you?
Look, it's so cute!
It's a cat!
Hi.
Wanna say hello?
We're playing now over there
so if you wanna come and watch, then...
- You want to?
- Yeah!
Good work, getting the punters in.
High-five. Hey, high-five.
Do you know what just happened?
Look at this!
You are a wonderful little being,
aren't you?
Got yourself a lovely ginger, all right.
Yeah.
I had a ginger tom just like him once.
Loved him with all me heart.
- He's got a mind of his own.
- That's the point.
The gingers, got wills like iron,
they have.
Mine wouldn't leave my side
till his last breath.
You got yourself
a lifelong partner there.
Better friends than people, they are.
Believe me.
Is that right, Bob? Good boy.
Hey, mister.
You have put in a shift today,
haven't you?
Yeah. You wanna come again tomorrow?
The bright lights?
Here, look.
This could be you, Bob.
Your name in lights. Look.
You wanna get some food
when we get home?
Dinner is served.
You played a blinder.
There you go.
Bob.
Bob!
Yeah, you're gonna be a professional
cat-harness wearer now.
What do you think about that?
Hello, stranger.
- Hi.
- Haven't seen you around.
What's with the sign?
I'm going on a march
to free farmed animals.
Free what?
Cows, pigs, chickens.
Turkeys.
You want them
just running in the street?
We want them not to be murdered.
Don't tell me you're a carnivore.
I've never really thought about it.
Well, think about it.
Every bite you take,
you're eating suffering.
Living all posh now, huh?
Off the streets and all?
What are you doing here?
I just thought
I'd follow a friendly face.
I thought maybe I could
crash with you for a bit, you know.
Spread the wealth about a bit.
- Hello, kitty.
- Hey! Go away, Baz, all right?
I mean it.
Come on, anything.
I had a bit of hard lines, man.
James, please.
Please, James.
Look at you.
All right...
- This is for food, Baz. All right?
- Promise. Yeah, for food.
- Please promise me.
- Honestly.
- Yeah, I promise.
- I mean it.
You need to
look after yourself, all right?
- Please, Baz, just buy some food.
- I promise. I swear.
And don't come back here, all right?
Nice cat.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.
- Brilliant.
- Hi.
- I hope you don't mind...
...l got Bob a little something
for Christmas.
Look at that, Bob!
You want a bit of that?
- And I made him a little something.
- You shouldn't have.
Thank you. Look at that!
- I think he likes it.
- Thank you so much.
- You're an angel.
- I wouldn't go that far.
I wasn't always a little old lady.
Thank you.
Look at that, Bob.
You're gonna have that later.
Hi, Betty.
Look at Bob.
Doctor Who's twin.
Love the scarf.
- Yeah. Just got it.
- You all right? You look tired.
I've been busy. Or rather, he has.
I've been demoted to sidekick.
I'm starving. Can I cook you dinner?
Anything...
...as long as it's tuna.
I'm level four. Vegan.
- I have no idea what you just said.
- I don't eat anything that casts a shadow.
You don't get shadows underwater,
do you?
How about this,
I will cook you dinner.
If you give me an hour.
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Okay. An hour. No more, no less.
- Okay.
I think this is a date, Bob.
So who did all these paintings?
Only the most talented painter I know.
- Well, that narrows it down.
- Steamed Seitan with Miso.
- Just eat it. It's good for you.
- Yeah.
I'm actually painting my flat as well.
Maybe not quite like this, but...
I can see.
I just bloody bought this.
I've got some turps in the kitchen
if you want.
Thanks.
Painting, buying. Life must be good.
Feels like I'm joining the real world
after all these years, you know?
- Meaning?
- Just...
You know I said
about my parents splitting up?
I just got moved around a lot and...
You went off the rails a bit?
A little angry, a little wild?
Yeah, you could say that.
But, anyway, what about you?
More wine?
Thank you.
All right. We need some real food, Bob.
What's it gonna be?
Want some hot dogs?
No? Okay.
Right, so, what do you fancy?
Wild Pacific pink salmon?
Is that a yes?
Okay, we'll get one of them.
What else?
Some tuna?
Yeah?
Yeah. That's a yes for that as well.
What else?
Boneless sardines?
Yeah, you want that, don't you?
Okay. That's good.
Salmon, tuna, sardines. Good to go?
All right.
We are gonna eat
like kings tomorrow, Bob.
I'll tell you what.
- We'll get these as well.
- Of course.
Like them?
Bob. They're for Betty.
Thank you, Bob.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, no. Please. Bob, down.
Baz. Baz, wake up.
Wake up, Baz. Wake up!
Come on, wake up.
Baz? Hello? Wake up.
Can you hear me?
Baz. Wake up.
Can somebody call an ambulance?
No, Bob, get away from that.
Hey, Baz. Come on.
Wake up.
Help! Call an ambulance!
- They're on the way!
- Baz, listen to me. Come on.
James!
- Has he OD'd?
- Yeah.
- Have you checked his airways?
- No.
Help me get him back.
Okay, come on.
Is he breathing?
Baz, come on!
Come on, Baz, wake up.
Come on, come on!
- He's OD'd.
- What's his name?
- Baz.
- Hello, Baz, can you hear me?
- You know what he's taken?
- Heroin, heroin.
How old is he, do you know?
- He's, like, 20.
- Baz, can you hear me?
What have we got,
he's in respiratory arrest.
It's okay, Bob. It's okay.
One, two, three, lift.
Move back, please, move back!
Give us some room.
I know a bit about addicts.
I was in Sheffield...
...studying a veterinary course.
My parents didn't call.
They drove up and told me.
My brother was everything to me.
Protector, teacher.
He was the best painter I ever knew.
This was your...
Your brother's place.
He died right back there
in the bathroom...
...needle still in his arm.
Twenty-eight.
- So why did you...?
- Move in here?
To be near him.
He tried...
...so hard, to get clean.
But I guess that
he didn't want it enough.
Or could want it enough.
But he couldn't do it...
...not even for me.
I thought you wanted clean.
I do. God, of course I do.
Then why not now?
I'm ready to come off the methadone.
It's a process, James.
It's my job to manage
the process with you.
I'm down to 10 ml.
Let's revisit this after the holidays.
God knows they're hard enough as it is.
Hey, you're doing great.
I just-- I want...
I wanna be clean.
I want to live a life, you know?
This kid I knew, Baz...
He...
He OD'd. He died.
And I don't wanna go that way.
I know.
After the holidays.
Yeah?
Look, I've got another appointment.
Okay.
Hey, no.
Come on.
- What are you doing for Christmas?
- Betty said she'd spend it with me...
...as long as I didn't mention the words
"Christmas" or "merry" in any order.
My kind of girl.
Ho, ho, ho, Happy Cats-mas!
- What's all this?
- Happy Cats-mas, Bob.
New girlfriend for you.
This is Bobina.
- He's not impressed.
- Sorry.
- He will. Just playing hard to get.
- Don't panic, by the way.
This isn't a you-know-what tree.
No, it's a lamp tree.
Taste like turkey?
- Not even vaguely.
-It does!
- Tastes like rubber.
- No, it doesn't!
It's nice, but what I think is
that if you're gonna eat tofu...
...why pretend it's turkey,
or burgers or whatever?
It's like giving tofu
an inferiority complex.
Let it be who it wants to be.
"I am tofu.
I am inedible."
- It's not inedible!
- No.
- Give it to Bob to try.
- Okay.
- He's a better judge than you.
- Bob? What's that?
What's that?
I think we'll take that as a "no."
I love it!
- Yeah?
- Thank you.
Right, so I'll read this to you, mate.
Look.
"Dear James and Boblet...
...happy Cat-mas.
Lots of purrs and whiskers.
From Betty."
Good, right?
Thank you.
Is this one of your brother's?
Yeah.
And it's just out...
Yeah, just out there.
Betty, that is so beautiful.
Come on.
- No. No, I can't sing.
- Yes you can.
It's awful. Horrible.
Come on.
Bob!
I don't know. ls it crazy?
What, surprising your dad
and his new family on New Year's Eve...
...when they've given no indication
that they want you there?
Yeah, well, when you put it like that...
But he didn't exactly say
I couldn't come.
And, I don't know, things have been
going pretty good lately.
Do you ever wonder
why people kiss with their lips?
I mean, why not...
...rub ears like, "I want to hear you."
Or wrists, like this.
Hey, you did way too many threes!
And there's not even a seven on the dice.
- You cheated. You have to go back.
- If you cheat, I get an extra card!
That's cheating.
You've gotta put that back.
Can't you play quietly? Come on.
Have you cleaned your teeth?
- You can't cheat! That's cheating!
- Oh, come on! For goodness' sake.
Happy families, eh, Bob?
All right, come on. We've got this far.
Girls! Come and clean this up.
You know what?
Let's put you under here.
- Girls, they'll be here in a minute.
- Two surprise guests...
...might be more than they can handle.
No, come on. Come on.
Good boy.
There's the door now. All right!
Happy New Year.
Thanks.
How are you doing? All right?
Nice house.
- Hi, kids.
- Girls, you remember your brother.
Pris, Faith, this is James.
You've grown up so much
since I last saw you.
What were you playing in there?
Dad and I used to play Trivial Pursuit.
- You remember?
- Yes.
You let me play the adult version
that weekend before I left for Melbourne.
- Did I?
- Yeah.
She was cheating.
And Mummy doesn't like you.
Mummy says you're a junkie.
- I didn't cheat, you cheated.
- Did not, you cheated!
- She <i>says</i> I'm a junkie.
- Stop it, girls!
- Where did she get that idea from?
- Stop it.
You can't be here.
We've got guests coming.
Girls! Mummy will be down in a minute.
I thought you said
New Year's would be okay.
I said "maybe."
You should have called.
He's a junkie. He's a junkie.
- Will you leave the tree alone?
- James is a junkie!
A recovering addict, actually.
- Daddy, he's got a cat!
- What the hell?
Hey, kids, meet Bob.
Hey, hey hey! Bob! Bob!
- Pris, leave it!
- Come here, Bob.
- Faith, stop screaming!
- Jack, what is going on?
They're coming at 8:00.
It's James.
Hey, Hilary. Happy New Year. Bob.
- What's he doing here? Faith.
- Mummy, Mummy! He's got a cat!
- But she's allergic!
- I know!
Bob!
- Pris, stop chasing...
- Get that thing out of here!
- She'll have an attack.
- I'm trying.
- James, please.
- Come on, Bob. Come on.
- Come here. Bob, come on, mate.
- For goodness' sake, James.
"Bob!
"No!
That was my mother's.
I know.
Bob. Bob. I'm so sorry.
- Get out of my house!
- Bob!
- You and your creature, just get out!
- Come on.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Okay, come on. It's okay.
- Calm down.
- How did he get in?
He's my son. You think I'd
close the door in his face?
- What have I told you!
- Let's get your lead on.
- What?
- Don't let him in!
I want to stroke him.
- Can I?
- Yeah, you can try.
- He's so cute.
- When he's here everything goes wrong!
- How old is he?
- I don't know.
- I want a kitten.
- He's never allowed into this house!
My friend Sammy has a kitten.
Make sure he's out of here!
Happy New Year, Dad.
Thanks.
Nice to see you again.
Cats are weird.
Go on, right there.
- That's it. Go on.
- Hey!
- Piss off, you moron!
- Looks more like "piss on" to me.
Get that dog away from here.
I'm trying to play here. Come on.
- Come on.
- What?
- Don't touch me.
- Can you get that person out of here?
- It's all right, Bob. It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Shut up!
Oi, back off! Back off!
I've got a cat under here!
Oi! Oi! That's enough!
- Give it up!
- Hey!
It's him, it's not me!
The dog needed a piss.
It's your fault! It's that dog!
I've got a cat in here!
CCTV proved it wasn't your fault.
But you're prohibited from busking
for six months.
I said where's Bob?
Do you want to thank me for
coming down here and bailing you out?
Maybe you can focus.
You can't go back to Covent Garden.
- You're banned from busking.
- I wanna know where my cat is!
- You missed your meds, didn't you?
- I just wanna know where Bob is.
He's safe. He's in the police kennel.
We can go and get him right now.
You got yourself arrested,
and you didn't get your methadone.
James.
You are so close.
Don't lose it now.
It wasn't my fault, none of this.
It wasn't my fault.
I'm gonna call the chemist...
...authorize them to give it to you
even though you missed it yesterday.
You go straight there. I'll get Bob. Okay?
Hello.
If you fail to show up any day,
we can't give you the medication.
But she called you, didn't she?
My key worker, she called?
I'm just warning you.
Okay.
- Sign.
- Yeah.
Come on, man.
- Let me explain!
- What's to explain? I have eyes, James.
You're an addict. You lied to me!
No, I didn't!
- I just shaded the truth a little.
- Oh, please!
Wait, look! Okay, yeah,
I'm on the methadone program...
...but I haven't used for three months.
Believe me. I am trying to get clean.
I can't be around addicts.
I told you that.
It's just, it's too much...
I can't do it.
And I wasn't shading the truth.
This dog came after Bob,
and I was trying to protect him.
And then this whole fight broke out,
and then I got arrested.
I wasn't doing anything wrong.
It wasn't my fault.
Now I can't busk. If l do,
then I'll get arrested again.
And then I don't know
what will even happen to Bob.
If you can't sing,
you can't make any money.
And if you do sing,
you'll get arrested.
And all you're thinking about
is what happens to the cat!
<i>When you sell our magazine,
you get out what you put in.</i>
You know how they say
weed is a gateway drug?
Yeah, I'm a little familiar
with the concept.
Well, The <i>Big Issue</i>
is a gateway opportunity.
I'll start you off with a handful of free ones.
Just like a pusher, right?
You sell them, the next ones
you buy from us.
Sell those, make a little profit,
buy even more.
After a while, you get better territories,
work your way up, etcetera.
Before you know it,
you're Rupert Murdock...
...except not a dickhead.
If you can't sell them,
we don't buy them back.
So you gotta plan.
You get one designated territory. Get it?
Poach on anyone else,
and you're done.
Period. Boom. Clear?
- Boom. Clear.
- Good.
You can't have an animal in your photo.
- This is your official ID.
- What animal?
I don't see an animal.
This is my co-pilot.
Yeah, I heard about that.
Okay.
Look this way.
Say "cheese," Bob.
You know what?
I might have just the right thing
for you two.
It'll cost a tenner, but it's worth it.
<i>Big issue! Big Issue!</i>
<i>Big Issue! Come on, guys! Give</i> it a <i>try!
Help Bob and I! Big Issue!</i>
- Hey. <i>Big Issue?</i>
- Can I have a selfie with the cat?
You take a picture,
and then you buy a paper. How's that?
- Is that a deal?
- You are a good businessman. I like it.
Come on, Bob, look at the camera.
- There you go.
- Thank you.
He wants to give you a high-five.
High-five, Bob.
- High-five there.
- That's £2.50.
I've only got £2.30. ls that all right?
- I can see that's £2.50.
-l'll owe it to you.
- Excuse me, mate.
- Hey, mate.
Hello. Peter Gruner.
- I'm from the lslington Tribune.
- Thank you.
Would you mind if I did a story
on you and the cat?
- Are you taking the mick?
- Can I pet him?
- You can try. Just behind the ears.
- See? You're a human interest story.
- What's that?
- Would you mind?
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.
Look this way, Bob.
Bob, look over there.
Bob! Lovely.
- Let me get another one. Hang on.
- Big <i>Issue!</i>
<i>Big issue.</i>
No, Bob cat. Bob cat.
<i>Big Issue. Big Issue.</i>
<i>Big issue.</i>
Bloody stupid cat.
Hey, mate.
Go screw yourself.
Hey, watch your mouth.
I've got a minor here.
Excuse me, sir.
Sir! Sir.
- Me?
- Can I take a picture of you and your cat?
- Please?
- Yeah, sure. Sure.
It's okay, Bob. He likes your hat.
- Great.
- Thank you. Can we buy a magazine?
Sorry, it's not my patch.
You've got to speak to that guy.
We really wanna help.
- You can't--
- Thank you.
- Have a great day.
- Okay. All right. And you.
Come on, I wasn't poaching.
He knows I wasn't poaching.
My patch, you're selling papers.
- What else do you call it?
- Envy.
- Envy? I'll envy your arse--
- Stop! Stop it!
- James, you knew the rules.
- I wasn't selling--
One month, no papers.
Come on! Don't do this.
I wasn't selling, I promise you.
There was this one couple.
You saw what happened.
So they forced you to sell to them?
- I wasn't trying to...
- Look, you're taking business off me.
Why are you making this up?
Why are you picking on me?
- You took the money. Yeah?
- Enough. Enough.
One month, no papers.
What?
Nothing.
Just the chaos.
Chaos around drug addicts?
Where life's a constant shit storm...
...that kind of chaos?
Bob, put the frog down.
Leave it.
One, two...
Thanks, there you go.
I'll leave that one.
That's for the tuna. Thank you.
Come on. There you go.
You need this more than me.
Thank you.
Cheers.
Thank you.
Come on, Bob.
Mate, there's nothing there.
It's empty, mate.
Bob...
Bob, stop it.
Give it a rest, mate. Come on.
Bob.
Stop it!
I'm sorry.
I know. I know you're hungry, buddy.
I'm sorry.
I'll find a way, okay?
I'll find a way.
James. What are you doing?
- Betty. Hi. I'm just...
- Wait, you've been banned from busking.
Well, Bob's hungry, I'm hungry...
If you get arrested...
-...you won't be able to feed Bob.
- They're not gonna arrest me here.
What, do you think
you're just above the rules?
Like they don't apply to you?
So typical.
- Typical of what, Betty?
- Stop it.
- No, go on, say it. Let them hear.
- Stop it.
What am I supposed to do?
How am I supposed to eat?
- I don't know.
- What do you want me to do...
...just erase the last 20 years of my life
and start over?
I don't know!
I would if I could.
Do you know
who shouts like this in public?
Junkies do. And the people
who fall in love with them, that's who.
I can't do this again.
I didn't like it any more than you.
Those are the rules.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
James.
Watch yourself, okay?
Yeah.
Big <i>Issue!</i>
Give it a try! Help Bob and I!
<i>Big Issue. Come on.</i>
Yes, mate.
Thank you very much.
- He's adorable.
- This is Bob. You wanna say hello?
- Say hello.
- Hi!
- Yeah. Care for a <i>Big</i> Issue, madam?
- Oh, yes.
- Actually, we came to see the cat.
- Oh, yeah?
- Graham can't stop talking about him.
- Where's he from?
He's beautiful, isn't he? I found him.
- Do you like Bob? £2.50, please.
- All right.
- Yeah. He's my best mate.
- You want the best for him...
- There you go.
-...all of that.
Thank you very much. Of course.
What I mean is,
I'd be willing to take him.
Well, to buy him.
- How much?
- He's not for sale.
Obviously this isn't the
best environment for an animal...
- Please.
-...living on the street and all.
- Yes, all right, darling.
- We've got a flat--
We'd be able to give him
all the things you can't...
-...like a decent home.
- He's not for sale.
- I'm sure you could use cash.
- No, I don't want your money.
How about how much for your kid?
I'll trade you.
- I'll give him a decent home.
- Excuse me?
How dare you.
That's exceptionally rude.
Bob!
Hey! No!
Bob!
Come back!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Thank you so much.
Excuse me,
did you see a cat here?
A ginger cat? No?
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob!
Bob.
Come on, mate. Where are you?
Bob?
Bob?
What if a dog got him? Or a car, or...
I can't...
It's been two nights, you know.
Look, I'm not saying this is it...
...but maybe Bob did
what he was meant to do.
He's a cat.
Cats are independent animals.
It's my own stupid fault.
I wasn't watching him.
You know,
I promised I'd take care of him...
...but I wasn't watching him.
This isn't a time
you wanna be on your own.
- What about your dad, or Betty?
- No, I need to...
I need to get home.
I need to wait for him there.
Maybe he'll come back.
I really think you should
have someone with you.
He might come back, mightn't he?
He might do, yeah.
He could come home, couldn't he?
James.
I know these two.
I used to see them all the time
when he was singing.
But look at this.
This guy and his cat
are all over YouTube.
Look at the hits.
Over a million.
They're on lnstagram.
And Facebook.
That is so cute.
Look at that.
- Incredible.
- So you're thinking a book?
You looking for paradise?
Because I've got it all here.
White, brown, whatever you like.
I want my cat.
I'm looking for a ginger cat.
Have you seen it anywhere?
Yeah.
Bob! Bob!
<i>He'! -</i>
Hey, mister.
Where have you been, hey?
Where have you been?
Oh, Bob.
Where have you been?
I'm ready.
I think you are, too.
It's about weathering the tests, James.
"Can I do it straight?"
That's always an addict's question.
Think of the worst flu you've ever had.
Multiply that by a hundred.
Do you know what "riding the bike" is?
When you can't keep your legs still
even when you're lying down.
For a week, every day will be a fight.
Every hour, a struggle
not to go out and score-.
It's harder coming off methadone
than kicking heroin.
You can't do it on your own.
I'm not.
I've got him. He got me this far.
The other day, we were selling papers,
and this guy came up to us.
Really well-dressed...
...the sort that wouldn't wanna
share the pavement with me before.
He called me "sir."
"Sir, do you mind
if I take your picture?"
No one's ever called me "sir" before.
And it's because of Bob.
He's shown me what life could be like...
...on the other side.
Betty?
I know you're in there.
I just wanted to say you're not gonna
see me for a few days.
Val's given me the go-ahead.
So I'm doing it.
I'm sorry that I've disappointed you.
After all this...
...l'll make it up to you.
I'll make it up to everyone I ever knew.
I just wanted to let you know.
You're gonna need food, a stockpile...
...because any excuse to go outside,
and you're gonna try and score.
Let me bring you the food.
Then lock the door.
Tofu?
I'll make an exception this once.
Okay.
But that's all.
I don't want you to see me like that.
And I've got Bob.
He'll look after me.
<i>Bob!</i>
<i>He'! -</i>
Hey, mister.
I'm proud of you, James.
So, what are you gonna do now?
Well, first thing...
...I'm gonna try and find
a way to thank you.
Come here.
All right, come on, mister.
Let's go. Come on.
Yeah.
You take care of yourself.
And you.
Thanks, Val.
Come on, mate.
Corning.
Yeah, that one too.
I'll go in, yeah?
Wanna give us a hand with this?
Ready.
Sorry, I don't know
why the door was shut--
- Hi.
- Hi.
Look at you.
You did it.
Yeah, just.
- You look great.
- Thanks.
How do you feel?
Yeah, now I feel good.
<i>Same...</i>
...but totally different.
What's going on? You're moving.
Yeah.
I'm going home for a while.
- Right.
- I can't stay here.
It's not my life.
It was my brother's...
...and I need to move on.
- Yeah.
- You actually helped me see that.
Good.
Yeah.
It doesn't necessarily mean goodbye.
- No.
- Wait.
For you.
I made this one.
- You just have to hang it over...
- Yeah, I know what these are.
Thank you.
That's my address.
It's my parents' address.
- That's where I'll be staying.
- Elizabeth Robinson.
It's my real name.
Hello, reality.
My number's on there, too...
...in case you need me.
Until we meet again.
There was a guy hanging around
who wanted to give you this.
He asked me to make sure you got it.
Literary agency.
Right.
- Say hi to Bob.
- I will do.
- Good luck.
- Yeah, you too.
Bye.
Well, we were thinking a book,
for starters.
- We'd like to team you with a ghostwriter.
- He'll help you tell your story.
Sorry, stories.
We think it would make a great book.
Or a series of books.
The important thing is
we need to get hold of you.
- I don't actually have a phone currently.
- Okay.
We can sort that.
Should we get one for Bob?
I think we can share.
Looks like he wants to write it, though.
What are you--
I'm clean, Dad.
-"Clean" as, what, like...?
- Everything.
I just wanted you to know.
You know, I was...
I was thinking while I was
standing here just now...
...the last time
I wasn't high in front of you...
...l was 11.
Before Australia.
I wanted to apologize.
For everything.
I don't blame you for giving up on me.
No, Dad, I don't want your money-.
I didn't give up on you.
I was ashamed...
...of myself.
I was never afraid to fly.
I just didn't know how to do.-..
I didn't know how to be your father.
I'm the one who needs to apologize.
- No...
- Jack, what are you doing out there?
I'm talking to my son.
And my grandson.
Got him on a lead, don't worry.
Wait till you see the screensaver.
Look at that.
Yeah?
Where'd they go, hey?
How are you doing
in the deep blue sea there, Bob?
Hey, come on. I've gotta get this bloke
Gary a load of notes.
Stop fishing.
Morning, monster.
Hello, mate.
Caught any fish yet?
<i>How is a guy, who's spent a third
of his life checked out, to write a book?</i>
Come on, Bob, help me out here.
I'm stuck.
Bob. Bob!
I just loved it.
- Every word.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Okay.
James, we're about to start.
Not before you say hi
to your biggest fan.
- Betty.
- I'm so proud of you.
Hi. Thanks for coming.
James.
- James.
- Yeah.
- Bob.
- Okay.
Off you go.
Okay, Bob.
Great, thank you.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
Hey, Bob.
- Hey, Dad.
- Son.
- It's all a bit overwhelming.
- Yeah.
He's got your scarf.
I told you he wasn't a stray.
Bob, you good?
Yeah.
Go on, Bob. High-five.
Good boy.
Hi, everyone.
Didn't expect there to be
so many people here.
I could make some joke about there
not being enough room to swing a cat...
...but I don't think Bob would like that.
A friend helped me with this.
And when I was stuck,
her advice was...
...start by mentioning that
everyone gets a second chance.
But that not everyone
manages to take them.
Luckily for me...
...l had some
very important companions...
...to help with my second chance.
<i>And then she said...</i>
...to just tell the truth.
And that's what I've done.
- Absolutely loved it, mate. Well done.
- Thank you.
Little paw print there.
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go.
- You enjoy that?
- Felt like I lived every moment.
Good.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come on, you guys.
Keep it going. That's great.
Now you guys.
<i>Beautiful! That's great.
Now, the basses.</i>
<i>Come on, get low.</i>
All together!
That's it, beautiful!
We'll break it down now.
<i>Yeah! Give yourself a round of applause!</i>
Yes, brother. Yes, mate.
