Yes
I found a newspaper article.
<i> "
Fire in coal mines outside control "</ I> </ i></i>
<i>  ".. The city still burning underground
World was forced to evacuate the city" </ I> </ i></i>
But my father did not think so.
Do?
City CICA was cursed by a demon powers
depict child has.
<i> His name is Alessa. Order
tried to purify with fire. </ I> </ i></i>
<i>Do not  success. And
Alessa chose to retaliate, </ i> </ i></i>
<i> invoking a world of darkness
, filled with terrifying creatures </ I> </ i></i>
<i> CICA this creature is Angel and his tormentors. </ I> </ i></i>
We should stop.
- No, I want to get there.
- I'm tired.
Need to rest, and you too.
Do you think we'll find?
After all, we'll find someone.
- You think I'm out of town?
- I.
No, I think we're very close.
And also do not think it is a good idea to go there.
- What?
- I think your father is right.
I do not think we should be
to go to Silent Hill.
Need to find.
You saw what he wrote in his notiþele.
Whether running.
- Vincent...
- No, listen to me. Order whatever you want.
I think Harry kidnapped.
- Do you back in town.
- I have no choice.
- I understand this?
- I understand.
Just...
PATH're just do not want something.
I did not sleep at all?
Not.
Can not move.
I wore this discussion.
I have to go.
- Why do not you trust me?
- I do it for my dad. You do not understand.
- I understand.
- I did not.
How could you?
Because I am a child of the Order.
What?
I was born and grew up in Silent Hill.
I was chosen to come to this world, let me assure you that you will return
in Silent Hill.
Not.
No, that's impossible.
In notiþele my father writes that the end is stuck in Silent Hill.
Is possible that some go
only for a short period of time,
but this requires sacrifice.
E I. .. suffer.
<i> Was chosen for this </ I> </ i></i>
- How could you do this to me?
- My whole life I was taught,
Ie, every order I was
you learn that Alessa is the largest river in the world.
She locked us in Silent Hill.
He ​​brings darkness on earth.
And you... and you are part of this river.
But I know that is not true.
Now that I've spent this time with you, I know you is not bad Like...
If you are part of Alessa...
This means that you are part of his innocence.
- You lied before.
- I had to do.
I'm watching. Q
spirits and protects the world. And I saw you.
You kidnapped father.
Please believe me, I had nothing to do with it
.
- Sorry.
- Why they took him and not me?
Because you have to go back voluntarily.
They took him  because
knew you would come after him.
Why so important?
Cause Order can not be free until you get rid of Alessa.
Block Her powers keeps us there and can not be destroyed until
and not a whole.
- You will make this possible.
- And my father?
- Live and you?
- Yes, but not for long.
My mother, Claudia, I always keep him alive after the
get what you want.
- Where is he?
- The shrine in the city.
- Wait, Heather.
- I.
You need it.
Need to find himself and the other half, and
You only you can save her father.
The other part is my grandfather.
Who is the insane asylum?
<i>Yes   His name is Leonard Woolf </ I> </ i></i>

approach ..
What is happening?
<i> Connects!
Do they stop </ i> </ i></i>
- You did it.
- I.
I did not do it.
How well could I do this?
Because you are part of Alessa.
Now that you're so close to the city,
darkness has left to wrap it up.
Vincent, what happens?
I do not know.
Vincent!

- I am your nightmare.
- I have to save my father.
He's not my father, not his.
And I have to make sacrifices.
Go to hell!
You do not realize until now?
We're already in hell.
And you're not welcome here!
Do you think I will not kill?
I do not care.
I'm you.
's Time to take back what was I give!
Help me!
We are one and the same person.
Father!
Sharon!
Sharon...
Not hurt!
What do you want from me?
Look around you.
This was our sanctuary.
Last place to live safe distance from the darkness.
And now, its river
far.
But thank God you came, finally, here.
- You saved us.
- I did nothing to you.
You did everything.
You defeated Alyssa.
Did you complete seal.
You are our savior.
If I did so many things for you,
Then let my father go.
You can not leave. Blood of God will feed the newborn ..
And your body will host soul.
Why?
- Why me?
- The way she was predestined.
You have been chosen to be the host
his soul.
Only God can get reborn.
And we will be released from this prison
and cleanse the world of sinners i
And we only need... your body.
Not.
Leave her alone.
You Seal Metatron.
With its help you can trust God.
Give it to me.
Take it, I want to see its true face.
- Father!
- Sharon.
<i> Ash A. .. </ I> </ i></i>
<i> had stopped falling from the sky </ I> </ i></i>
- You did this?
- No, I did it.
I think from now
Things will be different here.
Order was destroyed. And
Chosen nightmare is over.
- Desaparecidos.
- Someone will come as bad as her.
This is the soul of the lost city.
What happened?
- I can not leave.
- Why?
- Should remain here.
- Father, but we are free.
We're safe.
- For the first time.
- I'll find her mother.
You saved my life.
You will continue to be eternally grateful for that.
But Rose is still stuck somewhere around here.
- I'll find.
- Let me help you find yourself one.
None. I promised that after
will be safe, I'll look.
This is my job.
Did you finish your homework.
I wanna be free, finally.
Understand why should I do that?
You're everything I wanted.
- I love you, darling.
- I love you, Daddy.
Vincent, take care of my daughter.
Do you understand?
Do not think my help is needed.
Let's get out of here.
Yes
Urcaþi.
Make sure scãriþã.
- Thanks.
- I do.
Way you have luck here.
I have been here before.
- My name is Grady Traves.
- I'm Vincent.
- I'm Sharon.
- Nice to meet you.
Where you point the lovebirds?
<i> Take us here </ I> </ i></i>
- I agree with what she said.
- I understand.
