Okay. Punch it in.
Right.
Okay. Let's...
First of all,
refresh the screen here.
All right and go in a format ruler.
- There.
- All right.
Now, file?
- Right.
- Right.
- And it's in memory?
- Right.
And?
Mark this down
in the prefix file codes.
Prefix code. Right, right, right.
Okay.
Good. Yeah, you got it.
Another week, you'll have it down.
It's temporary anyway.
I said, it's temporary anyway.
I do not intend to be stuck doing this
for the rest of my life.
- Don't tell Mr. Digman I said that.
- Okay.
Because what I really wanna do is,
I'd really like to get into publishing.
There aren't any openings right now.
But what I would love to do is just
create a magazine, my own magazine...
which would be, like,
a forum for writers and intellectuals...
who can't get into print
anywhere else, who could, you know...
I'm not into editing or trying
to reach a particular audience.
Getting it out there,
they would get some momentum going...
and, you know, do something with...
With, you know...
Excuse me, one second.
I love that book.
I love that book.
Christ. Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I think Miller's really great.
"This is not a book.
This is a prolonged insult.
A gob of spit in the face of art.
A kick in the pants to truth,
beauty, God..."
Something like that.
That's very good.
That's all I remember.
I've read this before.
I mean, I don't...
I'm just rereading it.
I don't reread books that often...
but this one's my favorite.
<i>I like it better than Capricorn
or Plexus...</i>
<i>or Sexus.</i>
You know, he used to kiss himself
after he ate a good meal.
It's mostly...
Let me ask you. Does that cashier
seem a little weird to you?
He keeps making
these strange movements.
God!
I think he's just waiting
to be discovered.
Do you want another coffee?
No. I'm gonna head over
to my friend's house.
Which way you headed?
Downtown, SoHo.
Oh, nice. Nice. A loft?
Yeah. She's a sculptress.
Lately, she's been making these
plaster-of-Paris bagels
and cream cheese.
Really.
She's trying to sell them as
paperweights. You wanna buy one?
Paperweight?
Yeah, I would. How much are they?
I don't know.
If you think you might be interested,
her number's 243-3460.
243-3460. Okay.
Her name is Kiki Bridges.
Kiki Bridges. Okay.
- Nice talking to you.
- Yeah. Great talking to you.
Excuse me. Can I borrow your pen?
Thank you.
<i>- Yeah?
- Yes. Is Kiki Bridges there, please?</i>
<i>- This is her.
- Hi.</i>
You don't know me. I'm calling because
I'm interested in your paperweights.
<i>- Yeah?
- You're the sculptress, right?</i>
Mmm-hmm.
A girl I met tonight in a coffee shop
told me that she was staying with you...
<i>Oh, you mean Marcy.</i>
<i>- I don't know. She didn't say her name.
- Hold on. I'll get her.</i>
She told me about these paperweights
and the work that you do.
<i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Hello? Marcy?
- Yeah.</i>
Hi, this is Paul Hackett.
We met earlier tonight.
<i>Hi. Sure, I remember.</i>
<i>- How are you?
- All right. I'm all right.</i>
I just got in...
and I opened up my book
and saw your number and...
<i>Good.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>
<i>So...</i>
So do you work near that coffee shop
or live in the neighborhood or...?
<i>No, I was just over
at a good friend of mine's.</i>
<i>Actually, we had a terrible argument.</i>
That's too bad.
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>
I'm sure, whatever it was,
I'm sure you'll straighten it out.
<i>You think so?
Do you think I should try to make up?</i>
Well, I don't know, I mean...
You know... Maybe you're better off.
You know, I don't know what the
circumstances were, but sometimes...
You know, I don't... It's not even...
It's not my business.
<i>- Maybe you should come over, Paul.
- What?</i>
<i>- Maybe you should come on over.
- Sure. Sure. Now?</i>
<i>Yeah. Why not?</i>
Uh. Where to?
<i>I'm at 28 Howard Street.
Near the corner of Crosby.</i>
<i>It's in SoHo.</i>
<i>- The name on the buzzer is Franklin.
- Not Bridges?</i>
<i>Bridges is crossed out.</i>
<i>Just press the buzzer.</i>
Okay. About 45 minutes?
<i>- Yeah, great. I'll see you later.
- All right.</i>
<i>- Paul?
- Yes.</i>
<i>I'm really glad you called.</i>
Me too. Me too.
Okay. I'll see you later.
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>
I've only got a 20. Can you break it?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
No hurry.
Excuse me, I just...
Damn! Oh, my God!
Excuse me.
My money flew out the window.
Okay, that'll be $6.50.
Listen, my money
just flew out the window.
I put it in this cradle...
and you went so fast around
that corner that I don't have any...
What I'm saying is, I don't have
any money.
I'm really sorry.
Look, let me show you something.
Look, that was... I had $20.
And now I don't have any more.
I'm really sorry.
Franklin. Franklin.
Franklin.
Franklin.
- Are you Paul?
- Yeah.
Here, catch.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Your keys.
You can just put them on the table.
I like that.
- Do you?
- Yeah. Very much.
It reminds me of that
Edvard Munch painting.
<i>What's it, The Shriek?</i>
<i>- The Scream.
- The Scream. Right.</i>
Yeah.
Sort of like a three-dimensional version
of that painting.
Is Marcy here?
She had to go out
to the all-night drugstore.
Is she all right?
It's under control.
This place is huge.
Do you share it with anyone?
Hey, would you like to
work on this for a while?
I could use a break.
What?
It's not hard.
What are you talking about?
This is yours.
- How would I know what you want?
- Look, it's real easy.
Just take some of this stuff
and slap it on like this.
All right, I'm coming.
Yeah?
Of course he's here. You invited him.
That's your problem, Marcy.
I'm not gonna tell him.
I'm not telling him.
I can't talk any louder.
All right, hurry up.
- How's it going?
- It's great.
I'm just giving him a shoulder.
Look what you did to your shirt.
Oh, good.
Give it to me, I'll
throw it in the wash.
No, that's all right.
It'll only take 20 minutes.
That's okay.
Come on.
You wanna look nice
for your big date, don't you?
All right.
Twenty minutes, huh?
- Put this on while you're waiting.
- Thanks.
You do that all day
and your own shoulders get pretty sore.
Want a massage?
- You read my mind. Would you?
- Sure.
I'm not too good at this.
Just know a few basic moves.
Just make it hurt
and you're on the right track.
That's all I know.
Okay.
- You have a great body.
- Yes.
Not a lot of scars.
That's true.
Never occurred to me.
I mean, some women I know
are covered with them head to toe.
Not me.
Scars?
Horrible, ugly scars.
I'm just telling you, now.
I don't know.
I know, when I was a kid...
I had to have my tonsils taken out.
And after the operation...
they didn't have enough room
in Pediatrics.
So they had to put me
in the burn ward.
But before they wheeled me in,
this nurse gave me...
this blindfold to put on.
And she told me never to take it off.
If I did...
they'd have to do the operation
all over again.
I didn't understand what my tonsils
had to do with my eyes either.
But anyway...
that night...
at least I think it was night...
I reached up...
to untie the blindfold...
and...
I saw...
Hello again.
Sorry about this. I was detained.
Don't worry about it.
- So how are you?
- Good.
Well, I made it.
You wouldn't... I'm here.
Let's go into my room
and get away from all this mess.
Sure.
Your roommate was just
dipping all day.
Put me to work.
I feel like a real SoHo artist.
What did you do to her?
I didn't do anything to her.
She was asleep.
I mean, she just... She was tired.
What do you mean, what did I do?
Easy, easy. It was
an innocent question.
Look, I'm gonna take a quick shower.
I'll be right back, okay?
Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think a shower
would probably do you good.
You had a tough day.
I knew there was something special
about you.
I hope you don't have to get up early
tomorrow or anything.
No. No, I don't.
Because I think you're somebody
I can really talk to.
And tonight I feel like...
I feel like I'm gonna let loose
or something.
I feel like...
I feel like something incredible
is really gonna happen here.
I feel so excited
and I don't know why.
I feel it.
I'm glad you came.
Me too.
If you wanna smoke a joint,
there's some in there, feel free.
Uh. No. Maybe later.
<i>- Hello?
- Is Marcy there?</i>
Uh. She can't come to
the phone right now.
May I take a message?
<i>- Could you just tell her Greg called?
- Sure.</i>
Is she back?
- That felt good.
- Yeah.
- You want me to close the window?
- No, I got it.
Boy! Whoever used to live here
must have been a bodybuilder.
Jesus.
Who's Franklin?
The buzzer, when I came over...
Hey, I thought I told you
to stay on the bed.
Right.
I'm gonna ask you to wait here
just one more minute. I promise.
- All right.
- You're the best.
- What, Paul?
- What?
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
You didn't just say something
just now?
No, I didn't say anything.
I could have sworn I thought
I heard you say something in here.
Well...
I didn't.
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep at all tonight.
What's that smell? Is that linseed?
It's skin moisturizer.
I have dry skin.
Really?
Feels pretty soft to me.
Please.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I think you're very nice, I do.
Could we just talk a little while?
Of course. Sure.
Greg called.
How did that little faggot find out
I was staying here tonight?
Probably wants to whine to me
about his latest boyfriend.
Friends like that
are hard to deal with sometimes.
Well, that's what friends are for.
I know that, but I meant...
I just can't deal with it tonight.
Does he want me to call him back?
He didn't say.
Well...
Since you answered the phone...
he probably figured I was...
I'm scared.
Why don't you just tell me
what's wrong.
I was raped once.
As a matter of fact,
it happened right here in this room.
I lived here once.
He came in through there,
off the fire escape.
He held a knife to my throat
and said...
if I made any noise
he'd cut my tongue out.
He tied me to the bed.
He took his time. Six hours.
My God.
Was he...
Did they get this guy?
No.
Actually, it was a boyfriend of mine.
To tell you the truth,
I slept through most of it.
So there you are.
You wanna get some coffee?
I feel like getting out of here.
Absolutely.
Say, is there a place open this late?
Sure, it's not even 2 yet.
Ready?
Can I ask you something?
I've wanted to ask you this all night.
Who's Franklin?
Franklin?
Franklin is my husband.
Really.
Is that his loft, then?
He owns it, yes.
Do you live with him?
No. He's in Turkey.
I stayed with my husband
for three days.
I was very young when I got married.
My husband was a movie freak.
Actually, he was particularly obsessed
with one movie:
<i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
He talked about it constantly.
I thought it was cute at first.
On our wedding night, I was a virgin.
When we made love...
You've seen the film, haven't you?
<i>The Wizard of Oz? Yeah, I've seen it.</i>
Well, when we made love...
whenever he...
you know, when he came...
he would just...
scream out "Surrender Dorothy!"
That's all. Just "Surrender Dorothy!"
Wow.
I know. Instead of moaning or saying
"Oh, God" or something normal like that.
I mean, it was pretty creepy.
And I told him I thought so...
but he just couldn't stop.
He just couldn't stop.
He said he didn't even realize
it was happening.
He just couldn't stop.
So I just broke the whole thing off.
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm really putting you
through the mill tonight.
It's okay. I'm used to it.
You know, I still love him very much.
In fact, we write each other
every day.
Naturally,
I don't like to talk about it.
Could we have the check?
It's on the house.
- Really?
- Sure, what the hell.
Different rules apply this late,
know what I mean? It's like after-hours.
Thanks, Peter.
Sure, Marcy. Have a good evening.
It's okay. It's...
Do you want me to go?
The pill makes me sick.
Everything makes you sick, Marcy.
The guys gave it to me.
Oh, my...
God!
Well.
Here we are.
So how about that joint?
Yeah.
- Good idea.
- Great.
What type of pot is this?
It's Colombian.
That's a lie.
What?
This isn't Colombian.
I don't even think it's pot.
The guy who sold it to me
said it was.
Well, the guy who sold
it to you is a liar.
So are you. That's shit.
Don't get upset.
I just won't buy it from him anymore.
That's horseshit.
Are you all right?
Where are those plaster-of-Paris
paperweights, anyway?
I mean, that's what I came down
here for in the first place.
That's not entirely true.
I came to see you...
but where are the paperweights?
That's what I wanna see now.
What's the matter?
I said, I wanna see
a plaster-of-Paris...
bagel and cream cheese paperweight.
Now, cough it up.
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.
They're in Kiki's bedroom.
Then get them.
Because as we sit here chatting...
there are papers flying
around my apartment...
because I don't have anything
to hold them down with.
Fine.
I don't know, Kiki.
Sorry about that.
- It's really coming down, huh?
- You bet.
Here you go.
The fare is a dollar and a half.
What?
Fare went up to $1.50 as of midnight.
You're kidding.
Look.
- I've got 97 cents.
- No.
- It's raining like mad out there.
- No.
Would you just give me a break?
I really just wanna go home.
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
I could lose my job.
Who would know, exactly?
I could go to a party, get drunk,
talk to someone. Who knows?
Would you give me a goddamn token?!
No, goddamn it!
I can not give you a token.
Those tokens are $ 1.50.
I can't sell them for 97 cents.
We'd lose money that way.
All right, there's the train. Come on,
give me a token! Come on!
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I wanted to take the Express.
I mean, it was the other way around.
I'm talking to you.
I know. I'm sorry.
I've never done that.
I don't know what came over me.
The fares went up and I have 97 cents.
I won't even take the train.
I won't even take it. I'm sorry.
That's not my train.
That's the one I wanted. Thanks a lot.
Must be a full moon out there.
Can I get you something?
I have 97 cents.
That's not very much, is it?
No. No, it's not.
Do I have to order something?
I mean, can I just sit
here for a minute?
- Yes. Sure.
- Thanks.
Any time.
What'll it be?
I don't want anything.
I just wanna sit here.
Is that okay?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
But if you're looking to make friends,
don't get your hopes up.
Looks like a pretty slow night.
Yeah.
- Well, it is late.
- Not for this place.
Things are usually hopping
around now.
That's all right, really.
I just wanted to get in out of the rain.
I just hope it lets up soon.
I really just wanna go home.
Aren't the subways running?
But I happen to be broke
at the moment, see.
Christ. I'll give you the money.
Really? I can't tell you how much
that would mean to me.
Oh, Christ. Not another one.
What? Another what?
Guy lives in the same building as me.
He's been here three times tonight...
to tell me about three burglaries
in this neighborhood, all tonight.
- Shit.
- What?
What?
I'm just trying to remember if I turned
my burglar alarm on at home tonight.
Sometimes I forget.
Oh, well, anyway.
That's all right. It's all right.
Oh. That's all right. Forget it.
Doesn't matter.
I'd like to open the register.
What if I got a rush now?
Yeah, I see your point.
What about a key?
Do you have a key for that?
Yeah, but I keep it
up in my apartment.
Damn. That's too bad.
Listen, I can't go anywhere,
but how'd you like to do me a favor?
- For subway fare?
- If you don't mind.
You got it.
I'm at 158 Spring Street, top floor.
Wait a minute. What am I doing?
Right.
You don't know me, I don't know you.
I might rip you off, right?
Is that what you're thinking?
I'm not gonna rip you off. I'm not.
With what I've been through tonight,
you'd know
the last thing I wanna do
is steal from somebody.
I really just wanna get home.
Look, here.
Here are my keys.
This is my deposit, okay?
If I don't come back, these are yours.
Everything I own is yours.
I just wanna get home. Keep them.
Okay, all right. Good. Here.
The keys for the register
are over the light switch, on a hook.
The alarm is underneath
the light switch.
Make sure you see a beeping red light,
okay?
- Beeping red light. 158 Spring.
- Top floor.
I'll be right back.
Oh, no.
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus! God.
What's come from Phil?
I don't wanna read it.
I'm jealous.
He even sounded tan on the phone.
I wonder if this is
our local friendly burglar.
Did you get what you wanted
or did we get back and spoil your fun?
Who are you? You don't live here.
I'm a friend of Tom's.
Tom who? There are three Toms
living in this building.
Look, guys, I'm not a burglar.
So get your hands off me.
He asked you which Tom.
I don't know Tom's last name.
He's on the top floor.
How many Toms on the top floor?
How'd you get in here?
He gave me the keys. Look. See this?
He gave me the keys and I let myself in.
Sorry, but there have been about
8 break-ins here just last week.
Okay, I'm sorry, all right.
I didn't know that.
Hey, we gonna hit Radio Shack
tonight, man?
Wait till next week.
The new models come in.
Hey! Where'd you get that?
Kiki! God, what happened?
Just throw down the keys.
Throw it. Be careful.
That's right. Give it a good throw.
There you go.
Hold on, Kiki.
Bastards!
What have they done?
What are these guys, sailors?
Look at this.
It's so elaborate.
Must've taken them hours.
How'd they get in?
How did who get in?
The burglars.
The burglars? What burglars?
The ones who took your sculpture
and your TV set.
God.
- Neil and Pepe?
- Who?
It was Neil and Pepe.
They're friends of mine.
I just sold them my television
for 300 bucks.
How did you get a hold of my sculpture?
This the guy?
Yeah.
I'm Horst.
I'm Paul. Hi.
That was rude of you before, Paul.
You really ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
I am.
I don't know what could have
come over me.
Lack of discipline.
Possibly.
Well, it's not too late to finish
what you started.
Marcy, it's Paul.
Hi.
Listen, I owe you an apology.
There's just no excuse for
leaving the way I did.
And I'm sorry.
You know, I just figured...
it's not working out between us.
And, hell, I'll never see you again.
You know, there's just no excuse.
I think I just got a little spooked,
you know?
With that story about your husband
and your boyfriend.
I mean, that was really weird.
What was that all about?
And I gathered there's something...
wrong, or you have
some burns or something.
And  and I just couldn't handle that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened to me.
I don't know. Maybe the timing's
just off or something.
But I think I just better go.
Okay?
Marcy?
Marcy.
What?
Oh, Jesus! Marcy.
Oh, God! Breathe. Breathe.
Kiki! Kiki! Come on.
Oh, Jesus!
God!
Think.
Kiki! Horst!
<i>Paul and Marcy, Horst and I
went to Club Berlin for drinks.</i>
<i>Join us if you feel up to it.
Corner West Broadway and Grand.</i>
<i>See you! Kiki.</i>
Shit.
Operator, give me the police.
Yes, I wanna report a death.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Hey, it's me.
I did it. I quit my job.
What do you want me to do?
Let's go have a drink. Celebrate.
Pier Three is open.
Look, lady.
I don't know what your problem is.
But I've gotta get over to that bar,
get my keys, so I can get home.
Oh, look at this.
Now what?
This is incredible.
Where the hell is he?
You know, I live across the street.
Would you like a TV dinner?
Oh, wait a minute! Neil, Pepe!
Wait a minute! I didn't know!
It's that dude again.
Get out of here.
I didn't know.
I didn't know.
Oh, God.
My place?
You like The Monkees?
What's your name?
Julie.
I'm Paul.
Rough night, huh, Paul?
You look depressed.
I came downtown tonight.
Oh, God.
I didn't even know.
I didn't even know this girl.
Oh, God.
I didn't even know her.
Hang on.
Is that better?
"Chelsea Morning."
Go on. What is it? Talk to me.
I'm fine, really.
I'm gonna be out of your way
in just a sec. I really uh...
I'm just waiting for them
to open up downstairs.
I'll just get my keys and go home.
Boy, oh, boy.
Just let it go, honey.
Tell me your problems.
I don't think so.
Paul, lighten up. What is this?
This doom and gloom and...
Be loosey-goosey. Come on.
What are you talking about?
Come on, tell me your problems.
Where the hell is he?
What the hell time is it?
It's very late.
Jesus.
So you really hate that job, huh?
Yeah. I hate both my jobs, you know?
Oh, yeah? What else do you do?
Well, I work in
the Xerox shop downstairs.
Downstairs?
Yeah. We're right on top of it.
I've got the keys.
You wanna go down and see it?
No, thanks. I've had about
enough excitement for one night.
It's a lousy job.
But I can get free copies
whenever I want to.
Gee whiz.
What is that? "Gee whiz"?
I mean, you humoring me?
I don't have to take that shit.
What is it with people today?
You can't say anything
without getting a smart answer.
You have to be so goddamn careful
about everything you say.
You think I don't notice?
I know what's going on.
I overhear the customers
at the Xerox shop making fun of me.
I didn't mean anything by that.
I mean, it was raining outside.
And I invited you to
come into my home.
I didn't have to do that, now, did I?
First of all, you're not stupid.
Look, I have trouble figuring out
the tax on checks. So what?
I mean, 8 percent is a bitch!
So I make a few mistakes.
So I make a few mistakes.
Sue me! Call your lawyers!
Okay, come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.
- Wanna sit down? Come on.
- Okay.
I'm sorry I was rude before.
I really am.
Okay, no more crying. Please.
What a night.
Hey, Paul?
Do you like my hairdo?
Yes. Yes, I do.
Then why don't you touch it?
I don't wanna mess it up.
You won't.
- You want me to?
- Yeah.
Okay.
I hear him. That's him.
I hear him. I hear him. No, it's okay.
Thank God he's there. I can go home.
Excuse me. What's the matter?
Oh.
Well, nothing, I just...
You know, I really got the feeling...
that you kind of liked me, no?
You're not gonna leave now.
Not after I brought you in
out of the rain, are you?
All right. All right. I'm going to...
Here's what I'll do. I'll...
go to the bar,
give your boss back his keys.
Then I'm gonna get my keys.
Then I'll be back, okay?
- Should take all of two minutes.
- Yeah, sure.
Julie, two minutes. Okay?
Well, well, what happened to you?
Long, difficult story.
Honestly, when you didn't show up for
so long,
I figured you did rob me blind.
I had to close up here to check it out.
A neighbor told me he
did see you leave.
But he wasn't too sure
about you either.
But here you are.
I tell you, you had me worried.
How about a drink?
Sure look like you could use one.
You don't happen to have any powerful
aphrodisiacs back there, do you?
She won't put out?
No, it's not for her. It's for me.
I seem to have gotten myself
involved with...
one of your cocktail waitresses.
- Miss Beehive, 1965.
- Yes.
Don't even ask me how.
So take off.
What's she gonna do, kill herself?
Terminal.
What's up, Rich?
You know, you're right. Just give me
my keys. I'm gonna go home.
What's the matter?
My...
My girlfriend...
just killed herself a little while ago.
Took some sleeping pills.
Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, no.
- Yep.
We had an argument.
I told her she had to get
out of the apartment...
It's my fault.
God.
Marcy. Marcy, Marcy.
Marcy, Marcy. Marcy. Marcy. Marcy.
Marcy!
I don't know what to say. I just...
I don't know what to say.
What can you say?
After all, it wasn't your fault.
I'm going to...
I'll be right back, okay?
Try to stay calm.
Are you all right?
Why, yes.
You said two minutes, though.
I know. I know.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Did you miss me?
Like I've never missed anyone in my
whole life, is how much I missed you.
Really?
I can't believe how much I missed you.
I just...
- I really did miss you, I'm not...
- That's very sweet.
I'm gonna give you a present.
Don't do that.
That's really not necessary at all.
I mean, I've only known you,
what, an hour?
No, no, no.
You said that you were
gonna come back and you did.
In these days,
that is something to be commended.
And rewarded.
- Do you know what this is?
- No.
This is a plaster-of-Paris
bagel and cream cheese paperweight.
I bought it from a local artist.
Kiki Bridges.
Did you ever hear of her?
Julie.
I promised I would come back
and I did.
Now I really do have to go.
I gotta sleep.
You understand that, don't you?
And I promise I'm gonna
see you again.
I will. Okay?
You all right?
Why do you keep asking me that?
What's with you,
are you nuts or something?
Let's exchange phone numbers.
Wanna do that?
- Phone numbers?
- Yeah, come on.
It's a great idea. Okay.
I'll write it on this.
Okay. What's your number?
My number is 5-4433.
Very easy to remember.
5-4433.
That's not enough numbers, but okay.
5-4433.
- Okay.
- No, KL5-4433.
I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Sorry, sorry.
- Oh, God.
- Wait.
Get that away from me. Jesus!
Oh, really?
You're gonna be sorry for this.
Because I am going to get you!
You're kidding me. Not again.
What is this?
Hey, let's knock off for tonight, okay?
My back's killing me.
Come on. Let's look
for my statue, man.
It's gotta be around here someplace.
That makes me sick.
That statue was the first thing
in my life I ever bought.
See what happens when
you pay for stuff?
Somebody rips it off. Shit.
It's gotta be around here someplace.
Let's cruise down Mercer Street.
Tom?
Tom, it's Paul.
And I was afraid to go in because
you don't wanna confront one of them.
Some of them are drugged up.
And you don't know
if they have a knife or...
I wasn't out an hour.
I come in, the cameras are gone.
The lenses are gone, the whole thing.
Did you call your insurance agent?
I don't have insurance, besides...
It's that guy again. Hey!
Don't let him get away.
You know where he went?
Let's go this way. Maybe that's him.
Come on, get your grubby face
out of here. Get out.
Hey, fella, where you going?
Restroom?
You didn't just come use the bathroom,
did you?
The bathroom's for customers only.
I'm gonna order something, really.
I just wanna use your bathroom, okay?
Hey, didn't you hear me?
Come on, you goddamn mutt.
Get out of here and stay out of here.
Menu's on the table.
Make yourself comfortable.
I set it up for you.
Thank you.
<i>Paul and Marcy, Horst and I
went to Club Berlin for drinks.</i>
I'm just gonna go put a quarter
in the meter at my car.
Let's see.
I'll have a burger, medium rare, coffee.
May I enter?
I can't let you in at the moment.
Will it be possible to be admitted...
at a more convenient time
for the club?
It is possible, but not at the moment.
God.
If you're so drawn to it,
you can try and force your way in.
Got any money?
Yes, I have money.
Is that what you want? Money?
Why didn't you just ask that
in the first place, man?
Here. It's not much.
But it's all I've got.
I'll take it because I don't want you
to feel you left anything untried.
You keep the quarter.
You'll still have to wait
a few minutes.
Hey, Mott.
Why doesn't he
have to wait a few minutes?
Tonight is Mohawk night.
If you had a Mohawk, you could go in.
Come on. We're both adults.
Why don't you just let me in!
Do you really wanna go inside?
Yes. It's very important.
I've got people in there expecting me.
Why don't you just let me in.
You're sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
Coming through, coming through.
- To your left and straight ahead.
- What?
Right through there.
It's straight through there.
- Mohawk this guy.
- With pleasure.
Kiki! Kiki! Horst!
Kiki! Horst!
Marcy's dead!
Neil and Pepe are crooks!
I'm broke! Help!
- Kill him.
- No! Don't!
God, what have they done to me?
God. I'll kill those barbarians.
Kill them.
Bald. God! Get me a gun.
Hello? Hello?
Taxi. Taxi.
Come here.
- God, I'm so sorry.
- It's all right.
This is great.
Look, I got the money back.
Isn't that great?
Now you can take me uptown.
Great. I'll be right back.
See how you like it!
No, don't! No!
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
I don't believe it. Did you see that?
Hey!
Look at your arm. It's bleeding.
Oh, great.
I feel terrible.
Look, why don't you come with me.
And I'll get you a bandage.
No, thank you. It's not that serious.
No, I insist.
No.
- Do you have a telephone?
- Yeah.
I'm sorry. I just...
You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight.
You just wouldn't believe it.
Oh. I'm an ice cream vendor.
Mister Softee.
What?
You misunderstood me. I didn't
ask what you did for a living.
I said, "You wouldn't believe
what I've been through tonight."
It's not boring.
And I have my own Mister Softee truck.
It's not. It's not boring.
Also, you need a Class Four
New York chauffeur's license.
Guess who has one. Got it on my own.
Manhattan, please. Could I have
the number of Peter Patzak?
That's P-A-T-Z-A-K.
- Need a pencil?
- No.
On Mulberry Street.
Thank you.
Five, eight, one, nine...
six...
two.
That was funny. That was funny.
Patzak, please. P-A-T-Z-A-K
on Mulberry Street in Manhattan.
Thank you.
- Five, eight, six, two...
- Don't.
Nine, three, eight, zero.
Now I have forgotten the number.
What is wrong with you?
Are you all right?
I have had a terrible, terrible night.
Do you understand?
I'm just trying to entertain you.
I don't want any entertainment!
And I'm sorry I did that. I'm sorry.
I'm under... Oh, God.
I'm unable to get home tonight,
you know? I can't get home.
And I'm trying desperately...
to find a place I can stay tonight.
Just sleep. All I wanna do is sleep.
There was a place on Spring Street.
I could stay but I don't want to.
- Why not?
- Why not what?
Why aren't you there?
There's a place on Spring Street. Go.
Because the bartender who lives there.
His girlfriend killed herself tonight.
And I think it's because of me.
That's out, then.
That's right, that's out.
That is out.
That is not a possibility.
So if you'd just let me
make this phone call,
you'd be doing me such a favor,
you really would.
That can wait.
I hurt your arm. And now
I want to dress your arm, please.
All right.
- How'd they get there?
- What?
I was dipping papier-mâché earlier.
What is this?
"A man was torn limb from limb...
"by an irate mob last night...
"in the fashionable SoHo area
of Manhattan.
"Police having difficulty identifying
the man because no form of ID...
was found on his shredded clothing."
Shredded?
"And his entire face was pummeled
completely beyond recognition..."
- Okay. Forget that.
- Whoa!
Can't handle things
like that right now.
What does a guy have to do
to get his face pummeled?
Jesus! Why does that hurt so much?
Because it's infected.
Let me get a...
- I want to get it off!
- Just stop touching it!
I know, I'll burn it off.
No. You're not gonna burn it off.
I just need matches.
I'll go ask a neighbor.
- No, lady, no!
- My name is Gail!
Lady, no!
No matches. That's enough, now.
Where are you going?
I'm going home. I'm walking home now.
How far is home?
East 91st Street.
East 91st, are you kidding?
Listen, I like you
and I don't know why.
Why don't I give you a ride
in my Mister Softee truck?
How does that sound?
Where's the truck?
Right around the corner.
Well, come on.
Come on.
- What's the matter?
- Shut up.
- What?
- Shut up.
What's wrong?
- You're dead, pal.
- I'm what?
Gail.
Gail, what are you doing?
What's wrong?
What? Gail? What is that?
Are you still giving me a lift home?
What are you looking at me
like that for?
That's him!
Over there, with the whistle.
That's him! Get him!
Oh, shit!
Help! Help! Call the police!
Mrs. Nozig.
I went to school with your son!
Mrs. Clara. I mean, Mom.
Mom, it's me!
I can't. Oh, goddamn it!
You're so stupid!
Come on! Cut it out!
I'll probably get blamed for that.
What do you want from me?
What have I done?
I'm just a word processor,
for chrissake!
Excuse me. Hi.
I wonder, could you...
Oh, it's okay.
Would you help me?
Would you please help me?
What do you want me to do?
Where do you live?
Can you take me home?
Because there's certain things
that I, you know, will not do.
I'm telling you in advance.
I really have to tell you something
before we start.
I have never done this
with a man before.
I'm a little bit nervous.
Listen, can I...
Can I use your telephone?
Sure, it's...
I see it. That's great.
<i>- Operator.
- Get me the police, please. Right away.</i>
<i>Just a minute.</i>
<i>- Twelfth Precinct, Fitzgerald.
- Yes, officer. Thank God. Okay.</i>
My name is Paul Hackett.
I'm in SoHo.
I don't know the exact location.
I'm being persecuted
by a vigilante mob.
I'm sure you're aware of their actions.
Now, I have every reason in the world
to believe my life
is in serious, serious danger.
Evidently,
there's a series of robberies...
that are being conducted
in this neighborhood.
<i>Just get some sleep, buddy.</i>
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
I don't believe you.
Oh, my.
I'm sorry. I wonder...
could I just crash out on
your couch for a couple hours?
I am just beat.
Why don't you just go home.
Pal...
I've been asking myself that one
all night long.
So? So, what happened? Why can't you?
All right.
I met this girl tonight, okay,
in a coffee shop.
She gave me her phone number.
So when I got home, I gave her a call.
She said to come over.
In the cab,
all my money flew out the window.
Then I got to know this girl.
And I didn't get along with her well.
It didn't work out, so I left.
I tried to take a subway tonight.
The fare went up. Did you know that?
That the fare went up?
- Yes.
- You knew that?
I didn't know that.
I didn't know anything about that.
I haven't got enough money to get home
until I meet a bartender.
A really nice guy who wanted
to lend me money.
I mean, he really wanted
to give me the money.
I mean, they'd actually purchased
this piece of work here.
I didn't know anything about that.
She's also pissed off at me.
And for this I don't blame her at all
for the way I treated her friend.
And it was Inexcusable.
So I march in there to apologize.
But she'd already killed herself.
I was too late. So I...
And he was about to give me the money
when all of a sudden, his phone rang.
His girlfriend killed herself tonight.
Is that a coincidence?
No, because the same girl...
who I came downtown to see
was dead too.
That's because they're
the same person.
They're both dead.
I couldn't believe that.
He didn't know that I came down to,
you know... his girlfriend...
because he would have taken my face
and he would have smashed it.
Luckily, there was this girl, who saw
everything, who let me use her phone.
Really nice about it too.
Let me use the phone. That was it.
Just use it. Pick it up and put it down.
Up and down.
Now she's the one in the ice cream truck
who's trying to kill me!
They're all trying to kill me.
I just wanted to leave my apartment.
Maybe meet a nice girl.
And now I've gotta die for it!
You know?
Oh! That's the girl. That is Julie.
That's her. That's the girl. Look.
Julie! Julie! Julie, it's me!
What are you doing? Come here.
Oh, God. That's the one.
That's the one. Unbelievable.
No.
What's the matter with you?
You've gotta help me.
You've gotta help me.
Get ahold of yourself, okay?
Can he get a glass of water?
You gotta tell them.
Tell them it's not my fault.
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
You've gotta make things
clearer to me, pal.
I just got back from the morgue.
I'm not thinking too straight either.
There's an angry mob
that wants to kill me...
because they think
I'm robbing apartments.
I had keys to your apartment.
I didn't rob you, did I?
I could've robbed you blind.
But I didn't because I'm not a thief.
I'm not a thief. Right?
I'm not a thief.
All right. All right. Stay here.
Wait! Where are you going?
To get your keys.
Okay.
Thank you. Thank you.
Go ahead. I'll be right here.
- Just relax.
- I will, I will.
Thanks.
He's in here!
What can I do for you?
Why so empty?
Invitation only.
Then where is everybody?
Beats me. Must have stayed home.
Who's she?
Oh, that's June. She's always here.
Usually nobody notices her.
If you're interested,
you better hurry.
I'm closing up in a few minutes.
Excuse me, miss.
I couldn't help noticing you
and I wondered...
would you...
care to...
join me for a drink?
Just talking?
I'm having a really...
really bad night...
and I can't seem to find anyone
who would just...
who just will sit with me for just...
Without yelling at me
or something, you know?
I obviously wouldn't approach you
in this state...
were I not so...
unusually...
intrigued.
Well.
There.
I bared my soul to you.
May I?
- Why are you doing this?
- What?
You flirt with me.
You share your cigarette with me.
You dance with me.
You're nice to me.
Why are you doing this?
I want...
to live.
Okay, sorry, folks. Closing up.
I just want...
Time to go home.
To live.
Live.
Come downstairs with me, Paul.
Come on.
- Oh! They got in!
- What is it?
Look, lady. I have to tell you
something.
I'm in big trouble.
Those people up there wanna kill me.
- Is there another way out of here?
- No!
What is this?
No, don't go in there!
Oh, what's this?
No, don't touch that!
No, don't touch that vat!
Oh, God.
- Come with me, Paul.
- What?
Come with me. Come on.
You're closed, you wanna go home.
It's only gonna take a minute.
I'm telling you no one's in here.
You cannot reason with this man.
Don't move, I don't wanna
stick you with this stuff. Okay.
I just gotta put this piece here.
Hold up! No! Hold up!
Do you at all sense the pressure here?
This is very good for the pores.
Come on, it's a total search!
All right.
Good. No, no, no.
Now, pick this up.
Where's this lead to?
No. It's a private apartment.
Fine. Knock on the door.
No, wait.
I'll knock.
June. June?
Yeah, what is it?
Sorry to bother you. Some people
wanna look around your place.
Something about a robbery.
I'm working! Can't you see I'm working?
I know, I'm sorry...
Tough titty.
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Have you seen this guy?
Doesn't look so hard.
Is there another way out of here?
No. That's it.
All right, we're moving out!
Come on.
Look, we're sorry we disturbed you,
lady, but we were sure that...
Okay, let's boot it!
Wasting time here.
It's okay. They're gone.
Great. Great.
Okay, will you let me
out of this thing now?
No, you're safe like this.
They could still come back.
Look, lady, you've been great.
Terrific.
But can you let me out of here?
Listen, you know,
I'm involved in this too now.
I gotta keep working on you.
They could still come back.
Lady, let me out of this thing. Now!
Do you hear me? Let me out!
Okay, that's it.
I just wanna go upstairs
and check if they're still there.
Be right back.
Didn't I tell you, man? Check it out.
Check it out.
Man, this is junk.
What are you talking about, junk?
This is antiques, man. This is old.
It's plastic.
Let's call it a night, man.
We got enough stuff already.
It's my sculpture!
Hey, man, be careful with it. All right.
Hey, man, is it worth taking this thing?
What, are you crazy, man? This is art.
Art sure is ugly, man.
Yeah, that's how much you know.
The uglier the art,
the more it's worth.
This must be worth a fortune.
That's right.
- It's by that famous guy, Segal.
- Yeah?
<i>You see him on the Carson Show.
Plays the banjo all the time.</i>
I never watch Carson.
Yeah, well, that's how much
you know about art.
I don't know, man.
I'd take a stereo any day.
Yeah, what do you know, man?
A stereo's a stereo.
Art is forever.
