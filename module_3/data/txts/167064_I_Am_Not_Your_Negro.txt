Dick Cavett: Mr. Baldwin,
I'm sure you still
meet the remark that:
"What are the Negroes...
why aren't they optimistic?
Um... They say, "But
it's getting so much better.
There are negro mayors,
there are negroes
in all of sports."
There are negroes in politics.
They're even accorded
the ultimate accolade
of being in
television commercials now.
(audience laugh)
- I'm glad you're smiling.
- (audience laugh)
Is it at once getting
much better and still hopeless?
I don't think there's
much hope for it, you know,
to tell you the truth,
as long as people are using
this peculiar language.
It's not a question of
what happens to the Negro here,
or to the black man here,
that's a very vivid question
for me, you know,
but the real question is what's
going to happen to this country.
I have to repeat that.

<i>The summer has scarcely begun,</i>

<i>And I will be 55.</i>
Yes, 55, in a month.
<i>I am about to undertake
the journey.</i>
<i>And this is a journey,
to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>which I always knew
that I would have to make,</i>
<i>but had hoped, perhaps,</i>
<i>certainly had hoped,</i>
not to have to make so soon.
<i>I am saying that a journey

you have a right.
<i>Baldwin: The time
of these lives and deaths,</i>

is 1955,</i>

<i>to 1968, when he was murdered.</i>

<i>Consider that Martin
was only 26 in 1955.</i>
<i>He took on his shoulders
the weight of the crimes,</i>
<i>and the lies,
and the hope of a nation.</i>
<i>I want these three lives
to bang against</i>
<i>and reveal each other,

<i>Baldwin: That's when

<i>On every newspaper kiosk</i>
<i>on that wide, tree-shaped
boulevard in Paris,</i>
<i>were photographs
of 15-year-old Dorothy Counts</i>
<i>being reviled and spat upon

<i>in Charlotte, North Carolina.</i>
<i>There was unutterable pride,</i>
<i>tension and anguish
in that girl's face</i>
<i>as she approached
the halls of learning,</i>
<i>with history jeering
at her back.</i>
<i>It made me furious,</i>
<i>it filled me
with both hatred and pity.</i>
<i>And it made me ashamed.</i>
Some one of us should have
been there with her!
<i>But it was on that
bright afternoon</i>
<i>that I knew
I was leaving France.</i>
<i>I could simply no longer
sit around Paris,</i>
<i>discussing the Algerian
and the Black American problem.</i>
<i>Everybody else

<i>Baldwin:
I had at last come home.</i>
<i>If there was, in this,
some illusion,</i>
<i>there was also much truth.</i>
<i>In the years in Paris,</i>
<i>I had never been homesick
for anything American.</i>
<i>Neither waffles, ice cream,</i>
<i>hot dogs, baseball,
majorettes, movies,</i>
<i>nor the Empire State Building,
nor Coney Island,</i>
<i>nor the Statue of Liberty,
nor the</i> Daily News,
<i>nor Times Square.</i>
<i>All of these things
had passed out of me.</i>
<i>They might never have existed,
and it made absolutely</i>
<i>no difference to me
if I never saw them again.</i>
<i>But I missed my brothers
and sisters, and my mother.</i>
<i>They made a difference.</i>
<i>I wanted to be able to see them,
and to see their children.</i>
<i>I hoped that
they wouldn't forget me.</i>
<i>I missed Harlem Sunday mornings
and fried chicken,</i>
<i>and biscuits,
I missed the music,</i>
<i>I missed the style...</i>
<i>that style possessed by
no other people in the world.</i>
<i>I missed the way
the dark face closes,</i>
<i>the way dark eyes watch,
and the way,</i>
<i>when a dark face opens,
a light seems to go everywhere.</i>
<i>I missed, in short,
my connections,</i>
<i>missed the life which had
produced me and nourished me</i>
<i>and paid for me.</i>
<i>Now, though I was a stranger,
I was home.</i>
(music playing)
<i>I am fascinated by the movement

<i>I</i> am about seven.
<i>I'm with my mother, or my aunt.</i>

<i>I was aware that Joan Crawford
was a white lady.</i>
Yet, <i>I</i> remember being sent
to the store sometime later,
<i>and a colored woman who, to me,</i>
<i>looked exactly
like Joan Crawford,</i>
<i>was buying something.</i>
<i>She was incredibly beautiful.</i>
<i>She looked down at me
with so beautiful a smile</i>
<i>that I was not even embarrassed,</i>
<i>which was rare for me.</i>
(applause)
<i>By this time,</i>
<i>I had been taken in hand
by a young white schoolteacher</i>
<i>named Bill Miller,
a beautiful woman,</i>
<i>very important to me.</i>
<i>She gave me books to read and
talked to me about the books,</i>
<i>and about the world:</i>
<i>about Ethiopia, and Italy,</i>
<i>and the German Third Reich,</i>
<i>and took me to see
plays and films,</i>
<i>to which no one else
would have dreamed</i>
of taking a ten-year-old boy.
(indistinct singing)
- (shouting)
- (drums playing)
<i>It is certainly
because of Bill Miller,</i>
<i>who arrived
in my terrifying life so soon,</i>
<i>that I never really managed
to hate white people.</i>
<i>Though, God knows,</i>
<i>I've often wished to murder
more than one or two.</i>
(shouting and jeering)
<i>Therefore, I begin to suspect</i>
<i>that white people
did not act as they did</i>
<i>because they were white,
but for some other reason.</i>
(whimpering)
<i>I was a child of course,
and therefore unsophisticated.</i>
<i>I took Bill Miller as she was,
or as she appeared to be to me.</i>
<i>She too, anyway,
was treated like a nigger,</i>
<i>especially by the cops,</i>
<i>and she had no love
for landlords.</i>

<i>It</i> seemed <i>to</i> me that they lied

<i>They thought vengeance

<i>And, yes, I understood that:</i>

(screaming)
<i>I suspect that all these stories
are designed to reassure us</i>
<i>that no crime was committed.</i>
<i>We've made a legend

<i>Baldwin: Leaving aside
all the physical facts</i>
<i>which one can quote.</i>
Leaving aside rape or murder.
Leaving aside the bloody catalog
of oppression,
which we are, in one way,
too familiar with already,
what this does
to the subjugated
<i>is to destroy
his sense of reality.</i>
<i>This means, in the case
of an American negro,</i>
<i>born in that
glittering republic,</i>
and in the moment you are born,
since you don't know any better,
every stick and stone
and every face is white,
<i>and since you have not yet
seen a mirror,</i>
<i>you suppose that you are</i> too.
<i>It comes as a great shock

<i>which is your birthplace,</i>

<i>has not, in its whole system

<i>evolved any place for you.</i>
Baldwin:
<i>I know how to do it,
technically.</i>
<i>It is a matter of research
and journeys.</i>
<i>And with you or without you,
I will do it anyway.</i>
<i>I begin in September,
when I go on the road.</i>
<i>"The road" means
my return to the South.</i>
<i>It means briefly, for example,
seeing Myrlie Evers,</i>
<i>and the children.</i>
<i>Those children
who are children no longer.</i>
<i>It means going back to Atlanta,
to Selma, to Birmingham.</i>
<i>It means seeing
Coretta Scott King,</i>
<i>and Martin's children.</i>
<i>I know that Martin's daughter,</i>
<i>whose name I don't remember,
and Malcolm's oldest daughter,</i>
<i>whose name is Attalah
are both in the theatre,</i>
<i>and apparently are friends.</i>
<i>It means seeing Betty Shabazz,
Malcolm's widow,</i>
<i>and the five younger children.</i>
<i>It means exposing myself
as one of the witnesses</i>
<i>to the lives and deaths
of their famous fathers.</i>
<i>And it means much,
much more than that.</i>
<i>"A clod of witnesses,"
as old St. Paul once put it.</i>
Baldwin:
<i>I saw Malcolm before I met him.</i>
<i>I</i> was giving a lecture
somewhere in New York.
<i>Malcolm was sitting
in the first row of the hall,</i>
<i>bending forward at such an angle
that his long arms</i>
<i>nearly caressed the ankles
of his long legs,</i>
<i>staring up at me.</i>
<i>I very nearly panicked.</i>
<i>I knew Malcolm only by legend,
and this legend,</i>
<i>since I was a Harlem street boy,</i>
<i>I was sufficiently astute
to distrust.</i>
<i>Malcolm might be the torch
that white people claim he was,</i>
<i>though, in general,</i>
<i>white America's evaluations
of these matters</i>
<i>would be laughable
and even pathetic</i>
<i>did not these evaluations
have such wicked results.</i>
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>Malcolm had no reason
to trust me either.</i>
<i>And so I stumbled
through my lecture,</i>
<i>with Malcolm never
taking his eyes from my face.</i>

<i>Baldwin: As a <i>member

<i>Medgar was investigating

<i>Baldwin:
I was terribly frightened,</i>
<i>but perhaps that fieldtrip
will help us define</i>
<i>what I mean by the word
"witness".</i>
<i>I was to discover that the line
which separates a witness</i>
<i>from an actor
is a very thin line indeed.</i>
Nevertheless, the line is real.
<i>I was not, for example,
a Black Muslim,</i>
<i>in the same way,
though for different reasons,</i>
<i>that I never became
a Black Panther.</i>
<i>Because I did not believe that
all white people were devils,</i>
<i>and I did not want young
black people to believe that.</i>
<i>I was not a member of any
Christian congregation because</i>
<i>I knew that they had not heard</i>
<i>and did not live
by the commandment,</i>
<i>"Love one another
as I love you."</i>
<i>And I was not a member
of the NAACP</i>
<i>because in the North,
where I grew up,</i>
<i>the NAACP was fatally entangled
with black class distinctions,</i>
<i>or illusions of the same,</i>
which repelled
a shoe-shine boy like me.
<i>I did not have to deal with the
criminal state of Mississippi,</i>
<i>hour by hour and clay by day,</i>
<i>to say nothing
of night after night.</i>
<i>I did not have to sweat
cold sweat after decisions</i>
<i>involving hundreds
of thousands of lives.</i>
<i>I was not responsible
for raising money,</i>
<i>or deciding how to use it.</i>
<i>I was not responsible
for strategy</i>
<i>controlling prayer-meetings,
marches,</i>
<i>petitions,
voting registration drives.</i>
<i>I saw the Sheriffs,
the Deputies,</i>
<i>the Storm Troopers,
more or less in passing.</i>
<i>I was never in town to stay.</i>
<i>This was sometimes
hard on my morale,</i>
<i>but I had to accept,
as time wore on,</i>
<i>that part of my responsibility,
as a witness,</i>
<i>was to move as largely
and as freely as possible.</i>
<i>To write the story,

We've invited three men,
on the forefront
of The Negro Struggle,
to sit down and talk with us
in front
of the television camera.
<i>Each of these men, through
his actions and his words,</i>
<i>but with vastly different
manner and means,</i>
is a spokesman for some segment
of the Negro people today.
Black people in this country
have been the victims
of violence at the hands
of the white man for 400 years.
And following the ignorant
negro preachers,
we have thought that it was
Godlike to turn the other cheek
to the brute
that was brutalizing us.
Malcolm X, one of the most
articulate exponents
of the Black Muslim philosophy,
has said of your movement
and your philosophy
that it plays into the hands
of the white oppressors,
that they are happy
to hear you talk about
love for the oppressor,
because this disarms the Negro
and fits into the stereotype
of the Negro as a meek,
turning the other cheek
sort of creature.
Would you care to comment
on Mr. X's beliefs?
Well, I don't think of love
as...
in this context,
as emotional bosh,
but I think of love
as something strong
and that organizes itself
into powerful direct action.
This is what I've tried to teach
in the struggle in the South.
We are not engaged in a struggle
that means we sit down
and do nothing.
There is a great deal
of difference between
non-resistance to evil
and non-violent resistance.
Martin Luther King is just a
20th century or modern Uncle Tom
or a religious Uncle Tom,
who is doing
the same thing today
to keep Negroes defenseless
in the face of attack
that Uncle Tom did
on the plantation
to keep those Negroes
defenseless
in the face of the attacks
of the Klan in that day.
I think, though,
that we can be sure
that the vast majority
of Negroes
who engage in
the demonstrations,
and who understand
the non-violent philosophy,
will be able to face dogs
and all of the other brutal
methods that are used
without retaliating
with violence,
because they understand
that one of the first principles
of non-violence
is a willingness
to be the recipient of violence,
while never inflicting violence
upon another.
<i>Baldwin:
As concerns Malcolm and Martin,</i>
<i>I watched two men,
coming from unimaginably</i>
<i>different backgrounds,
whose positions, originally,</i>
were poles apart,
<i>driven closer
and closer together.</i>
<i>By the time each died,
their positions had become,</i>
<i>virtually, the same position.</i>
<i>It can be said, indeed,</i>
<i>that Martin picked up
Malcolm's burden,</i>
<i>articulated the vision
which Malcolm had begun to see,</i>
<i>and for which he paid
with his life,</i>
<i>and that Malcolm
was one of the people</i>
Martin saw on the mountain-top.
<i>Medgar was too young
to have seen this happen,</i>
<i>though he hoped for it, and
would not have been surprised.</i>
<i>But Medgar was murdered first.</i>
<i>I was older than Medgar,
Malcolm and Martin.</i>
<i>I was raised to believe that
the eldest was supposed to be</i>
a <i>model for the younger,
and was, of course,</i>
expected to die first.
Not one of these three
lived to be forty.

When Malcolm talks,

ministers talk,
they articulate for all
the Negro people who hear them,

Most of the white Americans
I've ever encountered,
really, you know, had
a Negro friend or a Negro maid
or somebody in high school,
but they never, you know,
or rarely, after school was over
or whatever,
came to my kitchen, you know.
We were segregated
from the schoolhouse door.
Therefore, he doesn't know,
he really does not know,
what it was like for me
to leave my house,
to leave the school
and go back to Harlem.
He doesn't know
how Negroes live.
And it comes as a great surprise
to the Kennedy brothers
and to everybody else
in the country.
I'm certain, again, you know,
that again like most white
Americans I have encountered,
they have no...
I'm sure they have nothing
whatever against Negroes...
That's really not the question.
The question is really
a kind of apathy and ignorance,
which is the price we pay
for segregation.
That's what segregation means.
You don't know what's happening
on the other side of the wall,

Well, you tell that
to my boy tonight,
when you put him to sleep
on the living room couch.
And you tell it to him
in the morning,
when his mother goes out of here
to take care
of somebody else's kids.
And tell it to me, when we want
some curtains or some drapes
and you sneak out of here and
go work in somebody's kitchen.
All I want is to make
a future for this family.
All I want is to be able to
stand in front of my boy
like my father
never was able to do to me.

<i>And the young,
white revolutionary remains,</i>
<i>in general, far more romantic
than a black one.</i>
<i>White people have managed
to get through entire lifetimes</i>
<i>in this euphoric state,</i>
<i>but black people
have not been so lucky.</i>
<i>A black man who sees the world
the way John Wayne,</i>
for example, sees it...
<i>would not be
an eccentric patriot,</i>
<i>but a raving maniac.</i>
<i>The truth is that this country
does not know what to do</i>
<i>with its black population,</i>
<i>dreaming of anything like
"The Final Solution".</i>
Baldwin:
The Negro has <i>never</i> been
<i>as docile as white Americans
wanted to believe.</i>
That was a myth.
We were not singing
and dancing down the levee.
We were trying to keep alive,
we were trying to survive
a very brutal system.
The nigger has never
been happy in his place.
<i>Baldwin: One of the most
terrible things,</i>
<i>is that,
whether I like it or not,</i>
<i>I am an American.</i>
<i>My school really was
the streets of New York City.</i>
<i>My</i> frame of reference was...
George <i>Washington
and John Wayne.</i>
But I was a child, you know,
and when a child puts his eyes
on the world,
he has to use what he sees.
There's nothing else to use.
And you are formed
by what you see,
the choices you have to make,
and the way you discover
what it means
to be black in New York
<i>and then throughout
the entire country.</i>

<i>I know how you watch,
as you grow older,</i>
<i>and it's not a figure of speech,</i>
<i>the corpses of your brothers

pile <i>up</i> around you.
<i>And not for anything
they have done.</i>
<i>They were too young
to have done anything.</i>
<i>But what one does realize
is that when you try to stand up</i>
<i>and look the world in the face
like you had a right to be here,</i>
<i>you have attacked
the entire power structure</i>
<i>of the western world.</i>
Forget "The Negro Problem".
Don't write any voting acts.
We had that. It's called
The Fifteenth Amendment.
During the Civil Rights Bill
of 1964,
what you have to look at is what
is happening in this country,
and what is really happening
is that brother
has murdered brother,
knowing it was his brother.
White men have lynched Negroes,
knowing them to be their sons.
White women
have had Negroes burned,
knowing them to be their lovers.
It is not a racial problem.
It's a problem of whether or not
you're willing
to look at your life
and be responsible for it,
and then begin to change it.
That great western house
I come from is one house,
and I am one of the children
of that house.
Simply, I am the most
despised child of that house.
And it is because
the American people are unable
to face the fact that
I am flesh of their flesh,
bone of their bone,
created by them.
My blood, my father's blood,
is in that soil.
Good afternoon, Ma'am.
It's raining so hard,
I brought rubbers and coat
to fetch my little girl home.
I'm afraid
you've made some mistake.
Ain't this the 3B?
- Yes.
- Well, this is it.
It can't be it.
I have no little
colored children in my class.
Oh, thank you.

Peola, you may you home.
Boy: Gee, I didn't know
she was colored.
Girl: Neither did I.
Peola: I hate you,
I hate you, I hate you!
Woman: Peola! Peola!
<i>Baldwin: I know very well
that my ancestors</i>
had no desire
to come to this place.
<i>But neither did the ancestors
of the people who became white,</i>
<i>and who require of my captivity
a song.</i>
<i>They</i> require a song of me,
<i>less to celebrate my captivity
than to justify their own.</i>
(soft piano music)
<i>Baldwin: I have always
been struck, in America,</i>
<i>by an emotional poverty
so bottomless,</i>
<i>and a terror of human life,
of human touch,</i>
<i>so deep that virtually no
American appears able to achieve</i>
<i>any viable, organic connection</i>
<i>between his public stance
and his private life.</i>
<i>This failure of the private life
has always had the most</i>
<i>devastating effect
on American public conduct,</i>
<i>and on black-white relations.</i>
<i>If Americans
were not so terrified</i>
<i>of their private selves,</i>
<i>they would never have become
so dependent</i>
<i>on what they call
"The Negro Problem".</i>
They said it wasn't nice
to say "nigger".
Nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!
Poor little nigger kids,
love the little nigger kids.
Who loved me?
Who loved me?
<i>Baldwin: This problem,
which they invented</i>
<i>in order to safeguard
their purity,</i>
<i>has made of them
criminals and monsters,</i>
<i>and it is destroying them.</i>
(band playing)
<i>And this, not from anything
Blacks may or may not be doing,</i>
<i>but because of the role</i>
<i>of a guilty and constricted
white imagination</i>
has assigned to the Blacks.
Look man,
don't give me that look.
You should have got
what was coming to you
after spitting
in that guy's face.
Why you...
<i>Baldwin: It is impossible to
accept the premise of the story,</i>
a <i>premise based on the profound
American misunderstanding</i>
<i>of the nature of the hatred
between black and white.</i>
- Man: That time is now.
- (grunts)
<i>The root of the black man's
hatred is rage,</i>
<i>and he does not so much
hate white men</i>
<i>as simply wants them
out of his way,</i>
<i>and more than that,</i>
<i>out of his children's way.</i>
(both panting)
<i>The root of the white man's
hatred is terror.</i>
- (grunts)
- I'm gonna kill you.
<i>A bottomless
and nameless terror,</i>
<i>which focuses
on this dread figure,</i>
<i>an entity which lives

Run!

<i>Baldwin: When Sidney
jumps off the train,</i>
<i>the white liberal people
downtown</i>
<i>were much relieved and joyful.</i>
<i>But when black people
saw him jump off the train,</i>
<i>they yelled, "Get back

<i>The black man
jumps off the train</i>
<i>in order to reassure

Baldwin: Someone once said to me

<i>He meant by this

<i>People have quite enough
reality to bear,</i>

Negroes are continuously making
progress here in this country.
The progress in many areas
is not as fast as it should be,
but they are making progress,
and we will continue
to make progress.
There's no reason that they, in
a near and foreseeable future,
that a Negro could also be
president of the United States
I remember, for example,
when the ex-Attorney General,
Mr. Robert Kennedy,
said that it was conceivable
that in 40 years in America,
we might have a Negro president.
And that sounded like
a very emancipated statement,
I suppose, to white people.
They were not in Harlem...
...when this statement
was first heard.
And did not hear,
and possibly will never hear,
the laughter and the bitterness
and the scorn
with which this statement
was greeted.
From the point of view of the
man in the Harlem barbershop,
Bobby Kennedy
only got here yesterday.
And now he's already
on his way to the Presidency.
We've been here for 400 years
and now he tells us
that maybe in 40 years,
if you're good,
we may let you become president.

David Schoenburn:
We're here in the studio today
<i>with seven men who have
two things in common:</i>
they are entertainers
and artists;
and they've all
come to Washington.
They are seven out of some
two hundred thousand
American citizens
who came to the capital
to march for freedom
and for jobs.
Will this tremendous outburst
now lead to a course of action,
Mr. Belafonte?
The now that is being
spoken about is the fact that
in a hundred years, finally,
through whatever the causes
have been in history,
and most of them have been
because of oppression,
the Negro people
have strongly and fully
taken the bit in their teeth,
they're asking absolutely
no quarter from anyone.
But I do say that
the bulk of the interpretation
of whether this thing
is going to end
successfully and joyously,
or is going to end disastrously,
lays very heavily
with the white community,
it lays very heavily
with the profiteers,
it lays very heavily
with the vested interests.
It lays very heavily
with a great middle stream
in this country,
of people who have refused
to commit themselves,
or even have
the slightest knowledge
that these things
have been going on.
(ominous music)
<i>Baldwin: I am speaking as</i>
a <i>member of</i> a <i>certain democracy</i>
<i>in a very complex country,</i>
<i>which insists on being
very narrow-minded.</i>
<i>Simplicity is taken to be

<i>along with sincerity.</i>
I am sorry.
I am deeply sorry.
And I am sorry.
I'm deeply sorry about that.
They are no excuses.
I am solely...
We have made
plenty of mistakes.
For that, I apologize.
I am very sorry.
I'm sorry I did this to you,

I'll just apologize for that

For any mistakes I've made,
I take full responsibility.
It's an honor to serve
the city of Ferguson

<i>Baldwin:
One of the results of this</i>
<i>is that immaturity
is taken to be</i> a <i>virtue</i> too.
<i>So that someone like that,
let's say John Wayne,</i>
<i>who spent most of his time
on screen</i>
<i>admonishing Indians,</i>
<i>was in no necessity to grow up.</i>
Baldwin:
We were free <i>and</i> we decided
to treat ourselves
<i>to a really fancy,
friendly dinner.</i>
<i>The head waiter came and said
there was a phone call for me,</i>
<i>and my sister Gloria
rose to take it.</i>
<i>She was very strange
when she came back.</i>
<i>She didn't say anything,</i>
<i>and I began to be afraid
to ask her anything.</i>
<i>Then, nibbling at something
she obviously wasn't tasting,</i>
<i>she said,
"Well, I've got to tell you</i>
<i>because the press
is on its way over here.</i>
<i>They have just killed Malcolm."</i>
There is nothing in the evidence
offered by the book
of the American republic,
which allows me really to argue
with the cat who says to me,
"They needed us
to pick the cotton,
and now they don't need us
anymore.
<i>Now they don't need us,
they're gonna kill us all off,</i>
<i>just like they did the Indians.</i>
<i>And I can't say
it's a Christian nation.</i>
<i>though your brothers
will never do that to you,</i>
because the record is
too long and too bloody.
That's all we have done.
All your buried corpses

Violence is a part
of America's culture.
It is as American as cherry pie.

Baldwin: if we were white,

Nat Turner would be a hero

Malcolm X might still be alive.
Everyone is very proud
of brave little Israel,
a state against which I have nothing,

But, you know,
when the Israelis pick up guns,
or the Poles, or the Irish,
or any white man
in the world says,
"Give me liberty,
or give me death",
the entire white world applauds.
When a black man says
exactly the same thing,
word for word,
he is judged a criminal
and treated like one
and everything possible is done
to make an example
of this bad nigger,
so there won't be
any more like him.

<i>Baldwin: What I am

<i>We must realize this,</i>
<i>that no other country
in the world</i>
<i>have been so fat
and so sleek, and so safe,</i>
<i>and so happy,

<i>and so dead.</i>

<i>to present

<i>Baldwin: To watch the TV screen

<i>is to learn some really
frightening things</i>
<i>about the American
sense of reality.</i>
<i>We are cruelly trapped between
what we would like to be</i>
<i>and what we actually are.</i>
<i>And we cannot possibly become
what we would like to be until</i>
<i>we are willing to ask ourselves
just why the lives we lead</i>
<i>on this continent
are mainly so empty,</i>
<i>so tame, and so ugly.</i>
These images are designed
not to trouble,
<i>but to reassure.</i>
<i>They also weaken our ability

<i>ourselves as we are.</i>

Were you able to listen
to the show backstage?
I heard a good deal of it,
but then I was behind
the whatsitmajig.
- Yes.
- So I heard only some of it.
Did you hear anything
that you disagreed with?
I disagreed with
a great deal of it,
and of course, there's
a good deal I agree with.
But I think he's overlooking
one very important matter,
I think.
Each one of us,
I think, is terribly alone.
He lives his own
individual life.
He has all kind of obstacles,
the way of religion or color
or size or shape
or lack of ability,
and the problem
is to become a man.
But what I was discussing
was not that problem, really.
I was discussing
the difficulties, the obstacles,
the very real danger of death
thrown up by the society
when a Negro, when a black man,
attempts to become a man.
All this emphasis
upon black man and white,
does emphasize
something which is here,
but it emphasizes,
or perhaps exaggerates it,
and therefore makes us
put people together in groups
which they ought not to be in.
I have more in common
with a black scholar
than I have with a white man
who is against scholarship.
And you have more in common
with a white author
than you have with someone
who is against all literature.
So why must we always
concentrate on color,
or religion, or this?
There are other ways
of connecting men.
Baldwin: I'll tell you this.
When I left this country
in 1948,
I left this country
for one reason only,
one reason...
I didn't care where I went.
I might've gone to Hong Kong,
I might have gone to Timbuktu.
I ended up in Paris,
on the streets of Paris,
with 40 dollars in my pocket
and the theory
that nothing worse
could happen to me there
than had already happened
to me here.
You talk about making it
as a writer by yourself,
you have to be able then
to turn up all the antennae
by which you live,
because once you turn your back
on this society,
you may die.
- You may die.
- (applause)
And it's very hard
to sit at a typewriter,
and concentrate on that,
if you are afraid
of the world around you.
The years I lived in Paris
did one thing for me:
they released me from
that particular social terror,
which was not the paranoia
of my own mind,
but a real social danger visible
in the face of every cop,
<i>every boss, everybody.</i>
(audience applaud)
I don't know what most white
people in this country feel.
But I can only include
what they feel
from that state
of their institutions.
I don't know if white Christians
hate Negroes or not,
but I know we have a
Christian church which is white
and a Christian church
which is black.
I know,
as Malcolm X once put it,
the most segregated hour
in American life
is high noon on Sunday.
That says a great deal for me
about a Christian nation.
It means I can't afford to trust
most white Christians
and I certainly cannot trust
the Christian church.
I don't know whether the
labor unions and their bosses
really hate me.
That doesn't matter,
but I know
I'm not in their unions.
I don't know
if the Real Estate Lobby
has anything against
black people,
but I know the Real Estate Lobby
is keeping me in the ghetto.
I don't know if the board of
education hates black people,
but I know the textbooks
they give my children to read,
and the schools
that we have to go to.
Now, this is the evidence.
You want me to make
an act of faith,
risking myself,
my wife, my woman,
my sister, my children,
on some idealism
which you assure me
exists in America,
which I have never seen.

<i>Baldwin: There is a <i>day in Palm Springs</i>
<i>that I will</i> remember forever,
a bright day.
<i>I was based in Hollywood,
working on the screen version</i>
<i>of the autobiography
of Malcolm X.</i>
<i>This was a difficult assignment,</i>
<i>since I had known Malcolm,
after all,</i>
<i>crossed swords with him,</i>
<i>worked with him,</i>
<i>and held him
in that great esteem</i>
<i>which is not
easily distinguishable,</i>
<i>if it is distinguishable,</i>
from love.
<i>Billy Dee Williams
had come to town</i>
<i>and he was
staying at the house.</i>
<i>I very much wanted Billy Dee
for the role of Malcolm.</i>
<i>The phone had been
brought out to the pool,</i>
<i>and now it rang.</i>
<i>And I picked up.</i>
<i>The record player
was still playing.</i>
<i>"He's not dead yet,
but it's a head wound."</i>
I have some very sad news
for all of you,
and I think sad news
for all our fellow citizens
and people who love peace
all over the world.
And that is that
Martin Luther King
<i>was shot and was killed tonight.</i>
(crowd scream)
Baldwin: <i>I</i> hardly remember
the rest of the evening at all.
<i>I</i> remember weeping, briefly,
<i>more in helpless rage
than in sorrow,</i>
<i>and Billy trying to comfort me.</i>
<i>But I really don't remember
that evening at all.</i>

<i>Baldwin: The church was packed.</i>
<i>In the pew before me
sat Marlon Brando,</i>
<i>Sammy Davis, Eartha Kitt.</i>
<i>Sidney Poitier nearby.</i>
<i>I saw Harry Belafonte

<i>I have a childhood

on holding myself together.</i>
<i>I did not want to weep
for Martin.</i>
<i>Tears seemed futile.</i>

<i>Baldwin:
The American way of life</i>
<i>has failed
to make people happier,</i>
<i>or make them better.</i>
<i>We do not want to admit this,
and we do not admit it.</i>
<i>We persist in believing</i>
<i>that the empty and criminal
among our children</i>
<i>are the result of some
miscalculation in the formula</i>
<i>that can be corrected.</i>
<i>That the bottomless
and aimless hostility</i>
<i>which makes our cities among
the most dangerous in the world</i>
<i>is created and felt
by a handful of aberrants,</i>
<i>that the lack, yawning
everywhere in this country,</i>
of passionate conviction,
of personal authority,
<i>proves only our rather appealing
tendency to be gregarious</i>
and democratic.
To look around
the United <i>States</i> today,
<i>is enough to make
prophets and angels weep.</i>
<i>This is not the land
of the free.</i>
<i>It is only very unwillingly
and sporadically...</i>

<i>Baldwin: I sometimes feel it
to be an absolute miracle</i>
<i>that the entire black population
of the United States of America</i>
has not long ago
succumbed to raging paranoia.
<i>People finally say to you,</i>
<i>in an attempt to dismiss
the social reality,</i>
<i>"But you're so bitter!"</i>
<i>Well, I may
or may not be bitter,</i>
<i>but if I were, I would have
good reasons for it.</i>
<i>Chief among them that American
blindness, or cowardice,</i>
<i>which allow us to pretend
that life presents no reasons</i>
<i>for being bitter.</i>
<i>In this country,
for a dangerously long time,</i>
there have been
two levels of experience.
<i>One, to put it cruelly,</i>
<i>can be summed up in the images
of Gary Cooper and Doris Day,</i>
<i>two of the most grotesque
appeals to innocence</i>
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>
<i>And the other,
subterranean, indispensable,</i>
<i>and denied,
can be summed up, let us say,</i>
<i>in the tone and in the face
of Ray Charles.</i>

<i>Baldwin: You cannot lynch me
and keep me in ghettos</i>
<i>without becoming
something monstrous yourselves.</i>
<i>And furthermore, you give me
a terrifying advantage.</i>
<i>You never had to look at me.</i>
<i>I</i> had to look at you.
<i>I know more about you
than you know about me.</i>
<i>Not everything that is faced
can be changed,</i>
<i>but nothing can be changed
until it is faced.</i>
<i>History is not the past.</i>
<i>It is the present.</i>
<i>We carry our history with us.</i>
<i>We are our history.</i>
<i>If we pretend otherwise,
we literally are criminals.</i>
<i>I attest to this.</i>
<i>The world is not white.</i>
<i>It never was white,</i>
<i>cannot be white.</i>
<i>White is a metaphor for power,</i>
<i>and that is simply a way of
describing Chase Manhattan Bank.</i>
I can't be a pessimist,
because I'm alive.
To be a pessimist means
you have agreed that human life
is an academic matter,
so I'm forced to be an optimist.
I am forced to believe
that we can survive
whatever we must survive.
But...
...the Negro in this country...
...the future of the Negro
in this country...
...is precisely as bright
or as dark as the future
of the country.
It is entirely up to
the American people
and not representatives.
It is entirely up to
the American people
whether or not they are going
to face and deal with
and embrace the stranger
they have maligned so long.
What white people have to do
is try to find out,
in their own hearts,
why it was necessary
to have a "nigger"
in the first place,
because I'm not a nigger,
I'm a man.
But if you think I'm a nigger,
it means you need him.
The question you've got to
ask yourself,
the white population of this
country has got to ask itself,
North and South,
because it's one country,
and for the Negro,
there is no difference between
the North and the South...
it's just a difference
in the way they castrate you,
but the fact of the castration
is the American fact.
If I'm not the nigger here
and you invented him,
you the white people
invented him,
then you've got to find out why.
And the future of the country
depends on that,
whether or not it's able
to ask that question.
