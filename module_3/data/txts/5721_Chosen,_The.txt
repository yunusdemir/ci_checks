Never underestimate
the enemy!
Let's have
some defensive solidarity.
Close it up.
No holes.
What're you looking for,
paratroopers?
Stop dreaming!
The war is on the ground.
That's right.
Close it up.
Okay, now, Malter,
What're you doing?
Malter, get your tuchus
out there.
Come on, that's right.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Come on, get out there, Reuven!
Look alive!
All right, let's close it up,
let's go.
All right,
Come on, let's go.
Get out there,
that's right, Davey, come on.
Show us what ya got,
Davey!
Move it around, boys!
Move it around!
Here they come!
Get a load of them.
<i>I suppose Danny Saunders and I
would have never met,</i>
<i>had it not been for America's
entry into World War II</i>
<i>And the desire of American Jews
to show the world</i>
<i>that we were as physically fit
as any other American.</i>
<i>We would prove this
by playing tough games</i>
<i>of neighborhood baseball.</i>
<i>But even though Danny
and his team lived</i>
<i>within five blocks of us,</i>
<i>it might as well have been
5,000 miles,</i>
<i>for Danny was a member</i>
<i>of a very orthodox
group of Jews called "Hasidim".</i>
<i>They wore their hair
and clothes the same way</i>
<i>their ancestors did hundreds
of years ago in Eastern Europe.</i>
<i>You could see them on Saturday,
Shabbos.</i>
<i>They would hurry off to their
small synagogues to pray</i>
<i>and to study the Holy Books,
the Torah and the Talmud.</i>
You ready to play?
Just about ready.
We're ready, too.
Good.
<i>They were a strange group.</i>
<i>I didn't know
very much about them.</i>
<i>They would always
keep to themselves,</i>
<i>and that was fine with me.</i>
Play ball!
All right,
look alive out there!
Come on!
Nice and easy!
Come on, Davey, baby!
Pour it on!
No batter!
Good boy!
Swing, batter!
Strike!
I don't think
this is their game.
They should stick
to praying.
Strike three!
You're out!
Yeah, one more just like that,
Davey! No batter!
Easy outs!
Easy outs!
Keep your eye
on the ball next time...
Throw him out, Davey.
Come on.
No batter!
No batter!
Malter, Goldberg?
Back up.
Come on, back up.
That's right.
Reuven, move back!
That's Danny Saunders!
He can hit!
All right, Davey, come on,
let's get him, Dave.
Whip it in there, Davey!
Whip it in!
Get in there, Davey.
Safe at second!
That was a nice shot.
You always hit like that
to the pitcher?
You always
this friendly?
No batter.
No batter.
Look alive out there!
Come on!
Field it! Field it!
Field it in!
We're getting slaughtered,
and it's only the first inning.
Malter, you take over
for Davey, okay?
Yes, sir.
Okay?
Okay.
Come on, Reuven.
Give him the buzz bomb,
Reuven.
Ball!
Pour it on, Reuven.
Pour it on!
Ball two.
Strike!
Ball three.
Agh!
Where is Reuven Malter?
Yes, he's over there.
Thank you.
How are you feeling?
Okay.
The hospital...
Just telephoned me.
They told me
you were awake.
I brought you
a few things.
I ran out
of a faculty meeting.
Is my eye
gonna be okay?
Why shouldn't it be?
Dr. Lockman operated on it.
He's a big specialist.
They operated on it?
Mm-hmm.
What was the matter?
There was a...
Piece of glass in your eye.
They took it out?
Yeah, took it out.
It's...
It's gonna be okay now?
Yeah.
Your eye's going to be
all right.
You sure?
Yes, I'm sure.
I know you're not telling me
something.
Please tell me.
I'll tell you exactly what they
told me about the eye.
Until the bandages are removed,
we won't know
Whether the eye
will be able to see or not.
But dr. Lockman
is very optimistic.
But he's not sure?
No.
No, he's... he's not sure.
Danny Saunders' father
called me twice today
and once last night.
He just wanted to know
how you were,
And he tells me his son
is very, very sorry.
He's sorry
that he didn't kill me.
Reuven,
what kind of talk is this?
<i>It wasn't an accident.
He wanted to hit me.</i>
You mean
he did it deliberately.
<i>It seemed deliberate.</i>
I brought your radio.
Just because
you're in a hospital
doesn't mean you should be
shut off from the world.
The news reports say Rome
was declared an open city,
it will be ours any day now.
Ah, ah, ah,
no reading.
What do you mean "no reading"?
I can't read a newspaper?
You are not allowed to read. What am
I gonna do about my schoolwork?
That's one of
the great advantages
of being hit in the eye...
No schoolwork.
I have to get
to the library.
You rest.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I just hate
these hospitals.
<i>Hello
to you guys and gals</i>
<i>who are giving American history
something to brag about.</i>
<i>Here's a high-jumpin' tune
dedicated to the kind of action</i>
<i>we want to see you enjoyin'
mighty soon.</i>
Hello.
I'm sorry
about what happened.
Who let you in here?
They told me
I could see you.
Your eye,
will it get better?
I don't know yet.
I'm sorry.
Is that it?
Huh? That's it.
Great.
I didn't come here
to fight with you.
If all you want to do is fight,
I'm gonna go home.
Yeah?
Good, go home.
I came here
to talk to you.
I don't want to listen to you!
Go home!
Good-bye!
<i>I am sorry.</i>
Look, just leave.
Do you understand English?
Leave.
Of course
I understand English.
Watch your step.
You know who came to see me?
Who?
Danny Saunders.
Ah, and?
And I threw him out.
Why?
Do you hate him that much?
Well, I don't like him
very much.
I'm glad I'm home.
I'm glad you're home,
too.
<i>Here was my room,
just the way I'd left it,</i>
<i>but somehow,
everything seemed different.</i>
<i>It was as if some part of me
had been left back</i>
<i>in the schoolyard
next to my shattered glasses.</i>
<i>My father had often told me
that health was a gift,</i>
<i>but I had always taken that
for granted.</i>
<i>But now,
now I tried to imagine</i>
<i>what my life would be like
with only one good eye.</i>
<i>I felt sick inside.</i>
<i>I was scared.</i>
Reuven, remember,
don't strain your eye!
I won't!
I got it!
Are you gonna get mad
at me again?
May I come in?
Yeah.
Thank you.
You were quite mean to me
at the hospital.
So?
I'd like to talk to you
about it.
I'd like to explain.
Are you willing to listen?
I'm listening.
It's like this...
Whenever I do something
I don't understand,
I try to think it through
until I understand it.
And what I don't understand is,
at the ball game,
I wanted to beat you
over the head with my bat.
I don't know why
I wanted to kill you,
But I wanted to kill you.
Do you feel this way
about most people?
No, Malter.
Just you.
Thanks for the compliment.
You still want to kill me?
No.
You are weird.
<i>I am?</i>
Yeah, you are.
You look like you walked
out of another century.
You played baseball
like Babe Ruth.
You talk like you're
from outer space.
Thanks for the compliment.
You can come in if you like.
Sit down.
Where'd you learn
to hit like that?
I practiced.
I thought you people, uh,
only studied Talmud.
I have an agreement
with my father.
I study my quota
of Talmud every day.
The rest of the time
is my own.
<i>Your quota of Talmud?</i>
Four pages.
Four pages?
I can do one page,
and I'm very good.
And even then,
I need my father
to come help me.
I have total recall.
Sure.
Prove it.
"American army casualties
totaled 3.283
and 12.600 wounded
up to midnight last night.
in the first 11 days
of the invasion of France,
the beachhead has become,
quote, 'absolutely secure',
Unquote, the Germans having
quote, 'last night'... "
That's amazing.
I can do all of "Ivanhoe."
Now you're trying
to show off.
Trying to make
a good impression.
You're doing okay.
I truly hope your eye
will be all right.
I'll manage.
Anyway, now I can look
like Errol Flynn.
Who... Who is he?
Errol Flynn. Robin Hood.
Captain blood, Errol Fly...
You don't know
who Errol Flynn is?
The movie star?
Ohh!
I've never been to a movie.
We don't go to movies.
Oh.
Where'd you learn
to play the piano?
My mother.
She died.
That sounds Hasidic.
No, Ziggy Elman.
Plays with Benny Goodman.
Who?
Benny... You don't know
who Benny Goodman is?
I don't believe... You haven't
been around too much, have you?
I should be going.
Okay.
That's my father.
He's writing an article
on Talmud.
I know.
You do?
My father knows
what your father writes about.
He doesn't particularly
approve.
So let him write
his own articles.
He would never do that.
You see, my father believes
that words distort
what a person really feels
in his heart.
Your father doesn't speak
with words?
Actually, he doesn't talk much.
At least not to me.
We talk when we study Talmud,
but otherwise...
<i>My father wishes
everyone could speak...</i>
In silence.
Ah, one more thing,
Ru-Venn.
Reuven.
Reuven.
If you'd like,
maybe I could help you
with your schoolwork.
Your reading.
Maybe.
"To die, to sleep,
to sleep, perchance to dream.
Aye, there's the rub,
for in that sleep of death,
what dreams may come
when we have shuffled
off this mortal coil?
Must..."
Must, must, what?
"Must give us pause."
"Must give us pause."
"Must give us pause."
I know that.
Do you know what it means?
They never ask us that
on finals.
<i>What do you dream about,
Reuven?</i>
I dream
about a lot of stuff.
Do you remember
any of your dreams?
Yeah. Sometimes.
I had a very...
I had a very funny dream
the other night.
I dreamt
there was this king,
and he was dancing
around my bed,
and he was dressed up
in a clown suit.
Do you know the Hebrew
For "king"?
<i>Of course, "melech".</i>
And for "clown" or "fool"?
<i>"Lemech".</i>
<i>The word for "king,"
melech,</i>
begins with an m,
and then an l.
<i>Whereas the word
for "fool," lemech,</i>
begins with the l
and then the m.
So what?
In Hebrew,
The word for "intellect"
<i>is "moch",
begins with an m.</i>
And the word for "heart,"
the seat of passion?
<i>"Lev".</i>
<i>Lev, that's correct.
Begins with an l.</i>
So you see, Reuven,
if you put the m
in front of the l,
the head in front of the heart,
then you're a king.
And if you put the l
in front of the m,
the heart in front of the head,
then you're a fool.
You calling me a fool?
No, no, no, no,
but don't you see the importance
that the symbols
in our dreams can have?
Reuven, deep inside of us,
there is something.
It's called
the unconscious.
It makes us do
and feel things
Without us ever even
being aware of it.
It's filled with things
That we're afraid
to tell to ourselves.
And it is only by interpreting
the symbols in our dreams
that we can find out
about what's really going on
inside of us.
Danny, where did you learn
all this stuff?
Um...
I've been reading about it.
In Hebrew class?
No.
In the library.
I get tired
just studying Talmud
I know it cold,
so I've been going
to the library,
reading other things.
It's okay with me.
With you, maybe.
My father,
he's very specific
about the things
we're allowed to read.
Have you told him?
No.
I haven't told anyone.
Until now.
I met this man
in the library.
He's been showing me
books to read...
Fitzgerald, Steinbeck,
Hemingway!
Now, now I'm concentrating
on psychology.
Adler, Jung, Freud.
It's... It's incredible, Reuven!
It's exciting!
I've been going to the library
as often as I can.
Without anyone
finding out about it.
I'll keep your secret.
What are you gonna do
after you graduate?
Go to Hirsch College.
Mm.
What about you?
Rabbinical Yeshiva.
You know, Hirsch has got
a rabbinical department.
It's a very good one.
Yes, I've heard of it.
But my father would never
let me go there,
So you're gonna become a rabbi
and take your father's place?
It's expected of me.
My family, they've been rabbis
for the past six generations.
It's like a dynasty.
And I'm next in line.
You don't sound
very happy about it.
I'm happy.
What'd you get in history,
Reuven?
Him? Him, he gets a 98.
With one eye, yet.
Yeah, but he's had help.
From who?
He's got his own personal Hasid
giving him lessons.
Hey, Goldberg,
would you just lay off?
Touchy!
Is this true?
Yeah,
that's the word.
He's hanging out
with a holier gang now.
He's getting
too good for us.
Ah, see?
There's one of his buddies now!
Hasidim!
I see'd him, too!
But I don't believe 'em!
See?
What'd I tell you?
Oh, there he goes!
Bye, Reuven!
Danny.
What're you doing here?
I'm looking for you.
My father wants to meet you.
Why?
I told him we were friends...
You don't mind me telling him
we were friends?
No, I don't mind.
Good!
Well, he has to approve.
He has to approve of what?
Of my friends.
Especially if they're
outside the fold.
So you'll come?
Yeah. I guess.
Where?
To meet my father.
Yeah, I'll come.
When?
Tomorrow for Shabbos.
Don't worry, Reuven.
My father is a great man.
You'll see when you come.
<i>Danny told me about the founder
of the Hasidic movement,</i>
<i>who lived with poor people
in Poland during the 1700s.</i>
<i>They called him
the "Ba'al Shem Tov",</i>
<i>the Master of the Good Word.</i>
<i>He had studied Kabbalah,</i>
<i>the secret books
of Jewish mysticism.</i>
<i>He preached a popular idea
that God is everywhere,</i>
<i>that he should be worshipped
through joy</i>
<i>and singing and dancing,</i>
<i>that to be a good Jew didn't
depend on how much you knew</i>
<i>but on how much you felt.</i>
My father's coming.
Papa?
This is my friend,
Reuven Malter.
Reuven Malter?
Your eye, it is healing?
That's good.
With God's help,
it will heal speedily.
I hear
you are a good student.
You know Torah?
Yes, sir.
You know Talmud?
Well, we shall see.
We shall see.
Amen.
This man was on a boat
and fell into the sea,
and the captain of the boat,
he saw this man was drowning.
So he threw this man a rope.
And, "Hold onto this rope,"
he shouted.
"Hold on to this rope.
Hold tight.
Hold tight.
'Cause if you let go,
you may lose your life."
Are we too not drowning
in a sea of ignorance?
Cruelty, death?
Who is our captain?
God!
And what is the rope
that he throws us?
It is our Torah!
Now it's not an easy task
to study Torah.
It is a task
that takes all day.
It is a task
that takes all night.
And there is a great danger.
Did not the Reb Meir say,
"He who is walking by the way
and studying,
and he breaks off that study
and he sees...
he sees a field,
and in that field,
he sees a tree.
him does not
The scriptures consider
As if he had forfeited
his life!"
Only...
Only through the Torah...
Through the Torah
can you lead a full life.
Only then will God,
the master of the universe,
Only then
will he hear your words!
Amen.
Amen!
Reuven?
Reuven, what did you think
of my, uh...
Little talk?
I mean, it was, uh...
Was it, uh...
Was it all right?
Was it good?
It was very good.
It was very good.
Was it, uh...
Was it, uh...
It was all, uh,
good and, uh, correct?
Sir?
Daniel?
It wasn't rabbi Meir
who said that turning from Torah
and looking on field or a tree
would be forfeiting a life.
It was written in the name
of rabbi Yakov,
Not rabbi Meir.
True.
It was rabbi Yakov.
And is it... Reuven?
Is it also true
that a man,
he should spend his whole life
only studying Torah?
Torah should be combined
with work and good deeds.
And whose words are these?
S-Simeon the righteous,
I think.
You think?
You should know.
I kn... I know.
You know?
I know.
He knows.
That's good that you know,
eh?
He know, yeah?
At least you could have warned me!
I didn't know!
So?
What's the hurry?
Mama,
this is Reuven Malter.
Reuven Malter.
Hello.
And this is my sister, Shaindel.
Hello.
Come on.
He usually only asks me.
Do you always go through
that routine?
Sure, but I don't mind it.
I'm used to it.
It's a kind of tradition.
That's some tradition.
My father's father
did it to him.
It's really not so bad.
The bad part is waiting
until he makes the mistake.
After that,
it's all right.
Actually,
it's kind of a game.
I enjoy it.
Some game.
Aren't you scared?
In front of all those people?
Ah! They love it!
Didn't you see their faces?
They're proud of us.
They're proud of my father.
Reuven, back in Russia,
My father saved
his whole community.
Banded gangs of Cossacks
Attacked the little town
he lived in.
They killed everybody.
They left him for dead with
a bullet wound in his chest.
Well,
once he recovered
He announced to his people
they were done with Russia.
They were going to America.
They all followed him,
just like that?
Of course.
They would have followed him
anywhere.
I don't understand.
I don't know any rabbi
who has that kind of power.
No, no, Reuven...
My father
is not just a rabbi.
<i>He's a Tzadik,
a righteous man.</i>
A bridge between his followers
and God.
You gonna be a bridge,
too?
Yesterday, I asked him
if maybe I could go
To Hirsch College
instead of
Rabbinical Yeshiva.
Yeah?
What did he say?
He didn't say anything.
I told you, my father
doesn't talk to me.
I'd hate that,
to not have
my father talk to me...
Uh, my son Daniel
has picked you as a friend,
but also,
I happen to know
that your father
is a famous, uh, scholar,
and he does scientific criticism
of the sacred words.
So I don't know.
Maybe I should worry
that the son of such a man
should be the friend
of my Daniel.
But then again...
Daniel should have a friend.
I mean, I myself,
I... I have...
I have many
responsibilities.
I am, uh...
I'm too, uh, busy
to, uh, to talk to him,
Hm?
Well,
let me tell you something.
Now, you listen.
It is not easy
to be a friend.
You hear?
Yes, sir.
Okay.
So have a good week
and come pray with us again.
Reb Saunders says
that he doesn't like
your articles very much.
I'm not surprised.
We come from two totally
different approaches.
He thinks Torah
was written by God,
and I think it was written
by man,
inspired by God.
But then there's
a lot of my own writing
I don't like myself.
Papa, what are you talking
about?
Your writing is...
It's brilliant.
Thank you,
but there is brilliance,
and there is brilliance.
I am a simple teacher
doing my job,
writing as well as I can.
I know my limits,
and I accept them.
But I'm no great leader
like a Reb Saunders.
Oh.
So now you like him.
I don't know him well enough
to like him or not.
I don't care particularly
for his Hasidism,
but he accomplished a lot.
It's not a simple task
to be a leader of people.
It needs a special gift,
and Reb Saunders has that gift.
It's a pity he keeps his
Hasidism in a separate world
And he resists modern ideas
and changes.
It's even more a shame
that a mind like Danny's
should be shut off
from the world.
Danny doesn't want
to be shut off.
He wants to go
to Hirsch College.
Danny?
And what
does his father say?
He told me that his father
doesn't talk to him.
What do you mean?
He said that his father
believes in silence.
You mean Danny was brought up
in silence?
Papa,
what does that mean?
I heard once in Europe
something about that,
but I never believed it.
He must be a very,
very lonely boy.
Anyway, I'm glad and proud
you made Danny your friend.
So am I.
You're studying German?
What's wrong with German?
Freud wrote in German.
I want to read him
in the original.
What are you looking at me
like that for?
Just because Hitler
speaks German
doesn't mean the whole language
is corrupt.
You know what the word
for "mysterious" is in German?
I don't know any German.
<i>It's "geheimnisvoll".
It means "full of secrets."</i>
<i>That's what the unconscious is.
Geheimnisvoll.</i>
<i>Geheimnisvoll.
Sound like spies to me.</i>
Hey, what do you say?
They sound like spies to you?
Loose lips sink ships.
Hey, what's with the curls,
honey?
You're in our way.
Hey, you're on our block.
No, no, no.
Let's go. Let's go.
Agh!
Reuven!
Sorry, Jew boy.
Are you hurt?
No! No, Reuven!
You dirty kike!
You told me you didn't
like to fight!
I don't.
Mrs. Saunders,
it's all right.
Levi, go get some witch-hazel
for your brother.
You sit here.
I'll get some wet towels.
So this is
what I can expect
When the two of you
are together?
Reb Saunders, I'm sorry.
It wasn't our fault.
You're sorry?
You wear that for a while.
You can see.
Yeah, I can see.
<i>Baruch Hashem.</i>
Papa?
Shh! Shh.
Danny, I want you
to meet my father.
Papa? I want to introduce you
to somebody.
Papa, this my friend,
Danny Saunders.
Danny, I'd like you to meet
my father.
<i>Your father?</i>
Yeah.
I had no idea.
How could you have?
I never told you my name.
Wait a minute,
what is going on here?
I am very grateful to you,
Mr. Malter.
It was you who was suggesting
books for Danny.
Well, a boy comes
into the library,
Sits down near
where I usually sit.
A Hasidic boy sits
a little bit in the corner
so no one
should recognize him.
But after a while,
he turns to me,
apologizes for having
interrupted my work
and asks me if I could recommend
a book for him.
I suggest one,
and two hours later,
he comes back
and has not only read it
but memorized it.
I was amazed, of course,
and I suggest another one,
and another and another
and another.
And here we are.
Why didn't you tell me?
It was not for me to tell.
Here's another book
for you.
Not very easy, but, uh,
you might like it.
By Freud, might hit you
at the right moment.
<i>The German title
is "Totem and Taboo."</i>
Would you like some help
with the bell?
Hello, Mr. Kaplan.
Come in.
Hi.
Danny's not here.
Do you know
when he'll be back?
He didn't tell me.
Are you still studying
together?
Yes.
We're preparing for college.
You're going
to rabbinical yeshiva?
No.
Well, do you want
to come inside
or wait out here?
I'd like to come inside.
Okay.
Reuven?
Hello, Reb Saunders.
Why don't you
come upstairs?
I want to talk to you
in the study.
Yes, sir.
Put the books on the desk.
Take the books
out of the chair.
Now you'll sit
in the chair.
There are a lot of books
in this room.
Yes, sir.
You'd think there was enough
books in this room
to last a lifetime.
That's why I'd like to talk
to you about something.
I understand that, uh...
My Daniel spends several hours
a day at the library.
Know I had to find out
about this.
The neighborhood's too small
that I shouldn't find out
about it.
And I understand, uh...
That he also spends...
Some of this time with you,
is that true?
Yes, sir.
And I understand also
that some of these hours
he spends with your father.
Is that, uh, also true?
Yes, sir.
But what I don't know
is what does he read?
Daniel is my friend.
He's your friend.
He's my son.
He's my most precious possession
in the whole world.
I mean, he takes
my place afterwards.
He follows me.
I can't tell my Daniel
what to read.
And this you may not understand,
you know.
I can't...
Well, I can't ask him.
But I can ask you.
Reuven...
Look at me.
It's very simple.
I need your help.
I don't want to lose
my Danny.
Not my Danny.
Reuven's here.
Good, where is he?
Upstairs in papa's study.
How long
has he been there?
For around 15,
20 minutes.
He knows
all about the library.
I made, uh,
Samovar tea!
Fresh.
Sit. Sit.
What? What's with
the long faces?
What,
nobody's talking?
Maybe I have something
for you.
I was saving it for
a special occasion,
But you look so sad,
maybe now's best, hm?
Here.
What's this?
Open, open!
It's a briefcase.
Beautiful, huh?
It's for your books.
Thank you, mama.
It's for your books
when you go to college.
Hirsch College.
<i>It's from me
and your father.</i>
<i>You couldn't say Reb Saunders
was very pleased</i>
<i>about Danny's
going to Hirsch,</i>
<i>but at least he was satisfied
that Danny would be able</i>
<i>to get his rabbinical degree
there.</i>
<i>The war was still the major
event on everyone's mind.</i>
<i>The Germans had launched
a big offensive</i>
<i>in the Arden region.</i>
<i>And while the Battle
of the Bulge was being fought,</i>
<i>Danny and I were studying
Talmud in the morning</i>
<i>and regular college subjects
in the afternoons.</i>
<i>I liked college.</i>
<i>It was challenging,
and it was exciting,</i>
<i>but for Danny,
it was very different</i>
<i>from what he expected.</i>
Let's get this clear
about Freud...
Dogmatic Freudians
are not scientists.
There are more like
medieval magicians.
What we are going to study here
is what psychology should be,
a science.
Look at this.
I got my first "A".
Isn't that great?
This calls for a little bit of
a celebration, don't you think?
And I feel like giving up.
Maybe I made a mistake
coming here.
Why? What's wrong?
Psychology class.
Freud was a scientist,
not just a dreamer.
I can see myself spending
the next four years
running rats through mazes.
What do these rats have to do
with the human mind,
hidden desires, evil impulses,
the unconscious?
You know...
You know what you need? Huh?
I think you need
a little healthy diversion.
I think you gotta widen your horizons
a little bit. - Mm.
Tell you what, I'm gonna
show you something, okay?
Come on, let's go.
I'm gonna take you somewhere.
No,
I have to finish my food.
They should send
that stuff overseas.
Come on, get up.
No.
Would you just get up, please?
What do you mean, no?
I have to study.
You have to study?
You've done
all the studying you can do.
Reuven. Reuven! Would you just get up?
What? What? What? What?
Don't tickle me.
Don't tickle you?
Just get up. Come on.
Come on.
That's good. Over here
What do you think?
It's a deception.
Have you ever noticed
how we have no pictures
or paintings
on the walls of our house?
It's because the images detract
from what's real,
from what's true.
I see you haven't stopped
looking.
That's...
Because it's...
It's beautiful.
<i>It's official!</i>
<i>The war in Europe is ending!</i>
<i>Germany has surrendered
unconditionally</i>
<i>to the western allies!</i>
I'm gonna get some beer!
Hiya, toots.
Well, come on!
Speak to the lady.
Come on!
Later, boys!
You okay, Danny?
Danny?
What's wrong?
A Hasid
should not even touch a woman
other than his wife!
Such encounters take your mind off God!
Danny? Danny?
Hello?!
How do you feel?
Did you like it?
No? How do they feel?
They're tight.
Tight on the nose.
That's no problem.
I can fix that in a second.
You wait here.
You'll like these.
Just like Levi likes his,
and just like
your father likes his.
You know, Reuven?
Yeah?
I think Levi would make
a very good rabbi.
Levi? A rabbi?
Sure.
Don't you think
he's a little young?
Ah. Now try them.
Better yet? Huh?
Oh?
Now, now you look like
a real rabbi.
I'll get you a fine case.
Uh, rabbi?
Rabbi? Sir?
I would like, to, uh...
I'd like to give your eyes
a real test.
What test?
How would you like to see
your first movie?
How do you suppose
he does that,
sings and kisses
at the same time?
No idea.
You liked it?
<i>American troops overrunning

<i>uncover the most horrible
atrocities</i>
<i>in the history
of this devastating war,</i>
<i>the Nazi concentration camps</i>
<i>general Eisenhower
is visibly appalled</i>
<i>as he inspects the incredible
evidence of Nazi cruelty.</i>
<i>The few survivors testify
to the deliberate murder</i>
<i>of thousands of prisoners.</i>
<i>Unsuspecting European Jews
were deported in cattle cars</i>
<i>to such camps as Buchenwald.</i>
<i>Behind
these electrified fences,</i>
<i>the death mills flourished.</i>
<i>Here is official documentary
proof of sheer mass murder.</i>
<i>Men, women and children

<i>The Nazis deceived
their victims by telling them</i>
<i>that they were going

<i>but the showers
were really gas chambers.</i>
<i>This was all part
of the Nazi plan</i>
<i>for the genocide

<i>Once inside,
they were exterminated,</i>
<i>their bodies then burned
in specially constructed ovens.</i>
<i>Camps like Buchenwald, Dachau,

<i>At the moment, fears mount
that the death tolls</i>

Though he slay me...
Yet...
Will I...
Trust in him?
How the world delights
in killing us.
All our leaders...
Our teachers...
Our families...
What's left?
All is reduced to...
Bones...
Ashes.
We are the survivors.
It's up to us
to keep our people alive.
We cannot wait for God.
How long are you gonna be gone?
I don't know.
Maybe two weeks.
Certainly two weeks.
Maybe three.
Here, this is where
you can reach me in Chicago.
And this is the number
and the address
of the people organizing
a Jewish homeland in Canada.
They know where to reach me.
Oh, papa, have you got
your shaving kit?
Shaving kit?
Shaving kit? No.
Maybe I should take you with me
as my secretary.
Thank you.
Will you be
all right over there?
Oh, I'll be fine.
Mrs. Saunders is supposed to be
a good cook,
better than you are.
Oh, she can't be better
than I am.
<i>She says she's better
than you are.</i>
And I believe her.
I'm the greatest cook in this house.
Oh, that explains why
I'm always hungry.
Thank you.
Have a good trip.
Move your feet!
Why should I?
I was here first!
The chair was there first!
Now move!
Hi, Levi.
Hi, Reuven.
Hi.
Hi, shaindel!
What?!
I said hello!
What?!
I said hel...
Hello.
Oy, Reuven!
Hi.
I'm so glad you're here.
Don't worry, we're gonna take
very good care of you.
In fact, I think we're gonna
fatten you up a little bit.
Eh, Shaindel.
Turn it off.
You want me to clean,
you don't want me to clean...
And if there's anything you want, please...
Reuven!
Don't hesitate to ask.
I'm so glad you're here.
I'll take your bag.
Let me get the bags!
"Let me get the bags"!
I've got the bags.
You go and get some
more hangers, okay?
Mrs. Saunders?
Thank you very much
for everything.
Enjoy yourself.
Go ahead.
No, you go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, go ahead.
Go ahead.
Mnh-mnh.
Tsk-tsk-tsk-tsk-
Tsk-tsk-tsk.
Papa, Herschel says
he can work miracles.
Can you?
Only God can make miracles.
He says you can predict
the future.
I can predict the future?
Yeah.
All right,
I'll make a prediction.
I will make a prediction.
I-I-I predict...
That if you
don't concentrate,
you will lo-o-o-se this game.
That's my prediction.
What are you reading?
A book.
I might have figured that out
if I had enough time.
Oh.
Aren't you supposed to be
helping your mother
in the kitchen?
Is that all you think
a girl does?
Cook and clean?
Boy,
do I pity your husband.
Boy,
do I pity your wife.
Let me see!
No...
Uh, Shaindel,
Come in the kitchen
and help me
with the vegetables, hm?
But I'm reading.
The book can wait.
The food can't. Come.
<i>What a strange and wondrous
household this was.</i>
<i>I never realized how full
the life of a rabbi could be.</i>
<i>There were babies
to be blessed</i>
<i>and boys to be bar mitzvahed
and disputes to settled.</i>
<i>An almost endless procession
of people came in and out</i>
<i>to get advice
from Reb Saunders.</i>
<i>On everything, anything.</i>
What is this?
Save it.
It'll bring you good luck.
You'll get married real quick.
<i>But the really special events
were the marriages.</i>
<i>And since I was now accepted
as a member of the family,</i>
<i>I was there
for all the celebrations.</i>
Reuven!
Wait, no! No!
No, Danny I... I can't.
I don't know how!
I don't... I don't know how.
Having a good time?
Danny, I am having
a wonderful time.
Good.
The groom,
he's not much older than us.
He's the only one
who doesn't look like
he's having such
a good time.
You know how long
they've been engaged?
No.
Six years.
Six years?
You mean they made up
their mind six years ago?
No.
Their marriage
was arranged.
It's a Hasidic custom.
It doesn't sound
very romantic.
Maybe not.
But it works.
Now,
my sister Shaindel...
Shaindel?
Yes.
Her marriage contract
was arranged
when she was just a child.
She's going to marry
the son of another rabbi.
Has she met him?
Once. Twice.
Does she like him?
I don't know.
I never asked her.
Reuven...
I thought
I should tell you now.
I wouldn't want you
to be hurt.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Come on, friend.
Come, come.
Dance.
In a minute.
Levi, you shouldn't play
with the food.
Eat it.
Look at Reuven,
you see how he's eating?
That's what you
should be doing.
Leave him alone, believe me.
He'll eat when he gets hungry.
Don't worry about that
And when
the messiah comes,
There'll be no more hunger
in the world.
There'll be no more war.
There'll be no more struggles.
When the messiah comes,
he'll lead our people
to the land of Israel.
I thought that the messiah
was supposed to come
after a great catastrophe.
Haven't we had that?
He can come any time.
In fact,
there's a very funny story
About, the...
The holy Reb Enoch
this man had such a problem
about the messiah,
you can't believe.
If he heard within
a block of the house a sound,
a cricket should make a chirp,
he thought it was the messiah.
If a stranger came
in the house,
this man would jump
like a white Mariah.
"The messiah, the messiah,
the messiah."
Meshuga,
not the messiah.
Well, there's some people
that say
that we shouldn't have to wait
for the messiah,
that Palestine should become
a Jewish homeland now.
Some people say we should build
this homeland for ourselves.
And who are these people
that say
that they should build
a new land?
Who are these people?
Well...
It is written that the messiah
and the messiah only
will bring the Jews
to the new land!
Only the messiah
when he comes will bring them!
And God will help build
their new land!
That's what written!
God!
Not Ben Goyen
and his henchmen!
No!
Never!
How am I supposed to know that
Zionism is a contaminated idea?
The men who want to set up
a state of Israel
are not orthodox Jews.
What difference
does that make?
Reuven...
Just don't talk about
a Jewish state here anymore.
Okay?
To my father,
the idea of a Jewish state
that's not religious
is a violation
of everything he believes.
I'm glad I didn't mention
it was my father
who said all that.
I might have been thrown out
of the house.
You would have been.
What are you thinking?
About my father.
I miss him.
You'll be glad to leave here,
won't you?
Well, you can't say I'm
particularly welcome right now.
You think my father's
a tyrant.
No.
I feel sorry for him.
He's trapped.
You know what it's like
to be trapped?
<i>I was glad
when my father came home.</i>
<i>It was a relief to get back
to the world again.</i>
<i>He was so possessed with
the drive for a Jewish state</i>
<i>that he threw himself
into more work.</i>
<i>He wrote speeches,
newspaper articles</i>
<i>advancing the cause
of a Jewish homeland.</i>
You're working too hard.
I'm fine, don't worry.
I worry.
I think that you're driving
yourself too hard.
You need some rest.
Rest?
While Jewish boys
are risking their lives,
fighting in the streets
for an idea,
for something they believe in,
I should rest?
No, I can't do that, son.
Only a life with meaning
is worthy of rest.
I want to be worthy
of that rest, you understand?
Yes.
Anyway,
we don't live forever.
I'm not trying to scare you.
Look, between you
and the doctor,
I'll live another 100 years.
You're scaring me.
Reuven...
I'm sorry.
But you must understand
this is the only value
I can see in my life right now
except you.
So please,
no more worries, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
You want this now?
What is it, tea?
Yeah.
Fight Jewish Zion!
No state of Israel
without the messiah!
No state of Israel
without the messiah!
Fight the Jewish goyim
That want to make
a false state of Israel!
No state of Israel!
No state of Israel!
We here have
a responsibility
to protect the lives of the men,
women and children in Palestine!
We are now being threatened
with Arab aggression!
Millions of us...
Have already died.
Many of our relatives...
Fathers...
Friends...
Only a Jewish state
can give meaning
to these savage acts.
Only a Jewish state
can guarantee that it will never
happen again!
We don't need sympathy.
We need money.
We need supplies.
We need action now!
Let each of us devote our work
and actions
to make the dream
of a state a reality.
Let us prove
to all the world
that we mean what we say
when we say "Never again"!
Never again!
Never again!
...Never again!...
.....Never again!.....
That's really something.
The front page...
Reuven, here,
we got a place for you.
Look.
They printed
the whole thing.
<i>In the Times as well.
Really?</i>
Hey, have you heard
about that group that's forming
to go over and fight with the Haganah?
Uh-huh.
Yeah, well I decided
to join them.
Heh! Some soldier
you'll make, Goldberg.
Better you should join
the other side.
So, Reuven, how's it feel
to have a famous father?
<i>Now you'll be famous.</i>
By association anyway.
Ah, Malter
and his mumza goyim.
Beat it, hippo brain.
Here, why don't you read this
and get some education?
I spit on your education.
You're worse than the Nazis.
What?
You're worse than Hitler.
He destroyed the Jewish body,
but you,
you'll destroy
the Jewish soul.
Goldberg!
Just calm down,
all right?
If they catch you fighting,
they're gonna kick you
out of the college.
You all right?
Yeah.
Danny?
I'll take care of it.
Go.
Look, I need to talk to you.
Not here.
Follow me.
What're we doing in here?
My father read
your father's speech
in the newspaper.
Well, my father made
a very powerful speech.
The rally
was a very big success...
It wasn't a success
at my house.
My father...
Exploded this morning.
You've been excommunicated
officially.
What?
I'm not to see you,
talk to you,
listen to you or be found within
four feet of you. Why are you...
Even talking to you now
might be betraying his orders.
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna do as he says.
Wait a minute...
We won't meet anymore.
I won't reject my father.
I won't defy my father.
I won't.
Listen...
I'm... I'm your friend.
Reb Saunders could accept
the relationship
Between Danny and us
in front of his people
except when it comes
to Zionism.
There are some Hasidim,
like the Dubovich,
who support
the idea of a state,
but definitely not
Reb Saunders.
Reb Saunders is a fanatic.
He's medieval.
They... They arrange marriages,
and they arrange friends.
They're complete fanatics.
Please don't generalize.
I don't like his attitude,
either,
but in a strange way,
it's the very fanaticism
of men like Reb Saunders
that has kept us alive
for 2.000 years of exile,
and if the Jews in Palestine
would have one ounce
of that same fanaticism,
we would soon have
a Jewish state.
That doesn't make me feel any better.
Me neither.
I'm sorry.
I wanted
the two of you to be friends,
and now I'm the cause
of your separation.
I'm sorry.
Danny...
<i>For the rest of that year,
Danny and I ate</i>
<i>in the same lunchroom,
we attended the same classes,</i>
<i>we even rode
on the same trolley cars,</i>
<i>and we never once said
a single word to each other.</i>
<i>The silence between
the both of us was ugly.</i>
<i>I felt completely helpless.</i>
<i>I couldn't concentrate
on my schoolwork.</i>
<i>I tried to talk about
all of this with my father,</i>
<i>but he was so busy.</i>
<i>The question
of the Jewish state</i>
<i>was being debated at the U.N.</i>
<i>The newspapers were filled
with accounts</i>
<i>of Arabs attacking
Jewish settlements.</i>
It's set for tonight. Are you gonna come?
Yeah.
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
Okay.
<i>Like my father,
I wanted to help.</i>
<i>I needed to help.</i>
<i>I felt that I, too,
had to do something.</i>
1, 2, 3, go.
Get those rifles off the floor,
quick!
Douse the lights!
Where have you been?
I've been out.
You know
how worried I've been?
I'm sorry.
Sorry?
It's 7:00 in the morning.
I waited for you all night.
I don't have time for this,
Reuven.
I thought I could trust you.
<i>You can trust me.</i>
I can't be waiting for you
all night.
I don't have the time for that!
I don't have the energy!
You know what's at stake.
I expect more of you
than just playing around!
You think
I was playing around?
What else?
I was doing your work.
Our work! What you believe in!
A f... a friend wanted me
to help ship guns to Palestine.
You want some breakfast?
Come.
I'll make you
some breakfast.
Uh, I got Woody Herman.
Anybody want Woody Herman?
No!
What do you think?
Let's quit school
and join Goldberg
and fight with the underground,
what do you say?
Sam, I think I want
to become a rabbi.
What?
Well, I've been seriously thinking about it.
I... like Reb Saunders,
a rabbi for today's world.
A rabbi.
What a waste.
I didn't say a priest.
I said a rabbi.
Rabbis can get married,
you know.
Rabbi, can I have a private
consultation with you?
Rabbi Malter,
will you save me
from my evil thoughts?
Papa...
Papa!
He's gonna be all right.
You sure?
He's had a stroke,
but you shouldn't worry.
He seems to be doing fine
now.
<i>Are you okay?</i>
Yeah.
Could I go see him?
Yeah.
C-21.
I'll be down in a minute.
Thank you.
Here, come sit here.
What do we got here?
I got the mail.
The mail.
Okay, who's that for?
This one's for you.
That's for me.
That's for you.
That's for me.
Mm,
this one's for you.
That's for me.
This one's for Danny.
This one is for Danny.
Where's
Columbia University?
That's across the river.
What's there?
Psychology.
Any more?
You have all been called here
on what is
a very sad occasion for me.
It is my duty to inform you
that one of our former students,
Sydney Goldberg,
was killed at a kibbutz
near Herzliya.
He was shot
while working in the fields.
As some of you may know,
he left college
to help participate
in the founding
of a Jewish homeland.
We wish to extend
our condolences
to his family and friends.
He will be dearly missed.
May his spirit return
to the Lord who gave it.
That is all, gentlemen.
<i>There is great anticipation</i>
<i>at this special plenary session
of the United Nations.</i>
<i>Debate has just finished
on the question</i>
<i>of the partition
of Palestine.</i>
<i>Should the proposal be passed
by the member nations,</i>
<i>it will mean
the first major step</i>
<i>in the creation
of a state of Israel.</i>
<i>We now take you to the floor
of the United Nations,</i>
<i>where voting
has already begun</i>
<i>on partition resolution

<i>It takes a two-thirds majority

<i>At this point,
they are shy by three votes.</i>
<i>Iraq against.</i>
<i>Mexico.</i>
<i>Mexico votes

<i>For the partition.</i>
We have a state.
Papa, we have a state.
We have a state.
<i>... 2.000 years of exile,
they can go home again.</i>
I'm having trouble
setting up a graph
in experimental psychology.
I was wondering if...
Maybe you could give me
a hand.
Can you?
I... need your help.
Are you speaking to me?
The ban has been lifted.
Terrific.
The Jewish state
isn't an issue anymore.
It's a fact.
No thanks
to you and yours.
My father is frightened
that...
Jews again will be killed,
this time by Arabs.
I needed you.
And you weren't there.
I'm sorry.
My father was very sick.
And it would have been nice
if you were around.
How is he?
He's better.
He's home.
Why'd you do it?
I had to.
I chose to.
Well, you may know how
to live with silence,
But I don't.
I've lived with silence
for a long time.
You learn
how to live with it.
You can hear the pain
of the world in it.
I don't understand that.
I hate you,
and I hate your father
For what you did.
It's sadistic.
You hate me?
No, I don't hate you.
I don't understand you.
I'm...
I'm... I'm glad
that you're back.
I've decided
to leave Hirsch.
You're not gonna
finish college?
Yes, but I'm planning
to transfer
to Columbia University.
Columbia has a great
psychology department.
Has your house blown up yet?
No.
What're you gonna tell
your father?
Danny?
Danny told me that Reb Saunders
wants to see me.
He invited me over
on the second day of Passover.
<i>He wants to talk to me
now, you see.</i>
He wants to talk to me,
but what does he want to say?
Why now?
You don't know why?
He wants to talk to Danny.
Through you.
Look at
the two of you now.
Both of you,
you are men.
You are a man,
and my Daniel's a man.
It's a...
It's a pleasure
for a father to see.
Sit down.
So now you'll tell me,
what you are going to do
after your studies.
I've been thinking
of becoming a rabbi.
So you're going to become
a rabbi,
And, uh, my Daniel, uh...
My Daniel will go
his own way.
Reuven, I'm going
to tell you something.
When my Daniel
was 4 years old,
I saw him... he read a book.
He didn't read the book.
He swallowed it.
He swallowed it like one
would swallow food.
And then he...
He came to me,
and then he told me the story
that was in the book.
This story was about a man
whose life was filled with...
With suffering and with pain,
and, uh, but, uh...
That didn't...
It didn't move Daniel.
You know, Daniel...
Daniel was happy.
He was happy because he realized
for the first time in his life,
what a memory he had!
"Master of the universe,"
I cried,
"What have you done to me?
You give me a mind like this
for a son.
A heart I need for a son.
A soul...
I need for a son.
Compassion and mercy
I need from a son.
And above all...
The strength to carry pain.
That I need from a son."
And how was I to do this?
I mean...
That was the question.
How was I to...
To teach him?
How was I going to be able
to do this...
To this son that I love...
And not lose
the love of my son?
When Danny was young,
I used to hold him close.
We used to laugh together.
We used to play together.
We use to whisper secrets
to each other.
We played.
Then as he became older,
and he became indifferent
to people
less brilliant
than he thought he was,
I saw what I had to do.
I had to teach my Daniel
that way.
Through the wisdom
and the pain...
Of silence...
As my father did to me.
I was forced
to push him away from me.
He became very frightened.
He became bewildered.
But slowly,
he began to understand
that other people
are alone in this world, too.
Other people are suffering,
other people...
Are carrying pain.
And then...
In this silence
we had between us...
Gradually his self-pride,
his feeling of superiority,
his indifference...
Began to...
To fade away.
And he learned
through the wisdom
and the pain of silence
that a mind
without a heart...
Is nothing.
So...
You think
that I've been cruel?
Maybe.
Maybe, but...
But I don't...
I don't think so
because my beloved Daniel
has learned.
Oh, let him...
Let him go.
Let him become a...
Psychologist.
Yes, I know.
I know about that.
I should know.
The books
from the universities...
The letters, oh.
Become a psychologist
already.
But you see,
now I am not afraid.
<i>I have no fear
because my Daniel is a tzadik.</i>
He's a righteous man.
And the world needs
a righteous man.
Daniel?
You heard?
Yes, papa.
And when you go forth
into the world,
you will be proud
and go forth as a Jew?
And...
You will keep
the commandments
of a Jew?
It is good.
It's good.
I don't know.
Maybe you should forgive me
for not being...
A wiser father.
I don't believe it.
Danny,
I don't believe it.
I, uh... that's...
You look great!
I came over
to say goodbye.
I'm moving out.
To, uh, an apartment
near Columbia University.
Well, Columbia's
not that far away.
We could still see
each other.
How did your father react
when he saw you like this?
He said he almost
didn't recognize me.
He talked to you?
We talk all the time now.
Danny?
I'll see you.
<i>There is a story
in the Talmud about a king</i>
<i>who had a son who had gone
astray from his father.</i>
<i>The son was told,
"Return to your father."</i>
<i>The son said,
"I cannot."</i>
<i>Then his father sent
a messenger to say,</i>
<i>"Return as far as you can,</i>
<i>and I will come to you
the rest of the way. "</i>
