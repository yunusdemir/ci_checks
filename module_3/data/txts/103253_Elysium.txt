I'm not the one

Perhaps, if you did have children.
Then you would behave in a manner

You know it can happen

You are here to persuade me to

Astute as always.
Come with me.
I'm not interested

I am interested in
something much larger.
This habitat is dying.
There is a political sickness inside of it.
A tumor that needs to be removed.
You and your company are in
need of revenue that is drying up.
So...
You built the Torus.
Can you override the servers and
place a new president in power?
A coup?
Are you suggesting a coup?
Is it possible?
I could write a reboot sequence.
It'd shut down the entire system,
and at that point...
you can encode a new President, yes.
Then that is what you will do.
And you will have your contract

- Wait, Max, you can not leave.
- I shouldn't have come here. I have to leave!
Max! She's dying. She's in
the final stages of leukemia.
I told you my life complicated.
I need you to help me.
- I've no idea how to do this.
- How to do what?
- Get her to Elysium.
- I can't help her. I...
I would if I could.
How about this? Fake citizenship.
If you took her there,
- could you heal her with this?
- It doesn't work that way.
This is coded to me,
it's locked to my DNA.
The people looking for me.They...
You don't understand who these people are.
If they find me here,
they will kill all of us.
The only thing I can do to help
you is leave. I promise you.
- She's all I have.
- I'm sorry.
You have bandages.
Yeah. I got bandages.
What are you doing?
I don't want you to be sick.
You wanna hear a story?
N.., ah...
There once was a meerkat
who lived in the jungle.
He was hungry
and he was small.
So small.
And the other big animals had all the food,
'cause they could reach the fruits.
So he made friends
with a hippopotamus
OK, stop!
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.
Yes, it does 'cause he can
stand on the hippopotamus' back
to get all the fruits that he wants.
- What's in it for the hippo?
- The hippo wants a friend.
I'm sorry.

I think we got him.
Yank this fucking boat!
- Mommy, is everything OK?
- It's OK, sweety.
Clear !
[SPAN]
What is this?
[ENG]
Good afternoon.
Sorry to come bursting into
your home. Didn't mean to...
traumatize your young daughter.
Me and the boys here are
looking for a young gentleman...
who was in this very house a moment ago.
We're hoping you can tell us
 where he went.
No.
I...
- I don't know where he is.
- I don't believe in ...
...committing violent acts
in front of the kids.
So I just need you to
close your eyes, sweetheart.
- It's OK.
- I really need you to tell me.
Hey?
- You remember now?
- Mommy!
Close your eyes,
keep your fucking eyes closed.
Keep her eyes closed.
Please, I don't know where he is.
He was wounded,
I helped him and he left.
Please!
D'you fucking hear that?
No loyalty nowadays, hey?
What's this here?
- This a hospital you're runninghere?
- She's sick.
She's sick? Let me have
a look at her... Alright!
- Don't touch her.
- See that? Protective instinct, here!
- I said don't touch her!
- I'm just trying to have a word with your child.
Do not touch her!
- Bring her. Come!
- Where are you taking her?
Sweety, it's OK.
It's OK, darling. It's OK.
Sit! Shut up!
Stop!
No, no, don't shoot him!
Put the gun down! Let him come!
- You got something, didn't you?
- What?
That's why they shut down
the sky... what is it?
Wire transfers? Corporate intel?
You gotta have something big in there!
No. I fucking got nothing, man!
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead.
You owe me. Let's go fucking now!
We can't!
The flight system is jammed!
Nobody is going up there.
- Until when?
- Till I don't fucking know.
- I gotta fucking get up there!
- Everyone needs to get up there.
My guys are working on it.
See if they have a hope in hell
of ever getting back online.
But, for now...
- Let's just take a look at
 that head of yours.
- Get away from me, man!
Look at me, if they shut down
the whole fucking sky,
for what's in your head...
Maybe the key to opening it
could be in there too, right?
Come on.
Alright
They will hunt you to the edge
of the world for this.
What is it?
It is a reboot program for Elysium.
Whoever has this, has the power
to override their whole system.
Open the borders...
Make everyone
a citizen of Elysium.
This can save your life.
- We can save everyone.
- When can I go?
They're trying to hack through
the signal jam, but soon...
- Don't bullshit me,
when can we go?
- I dunno.
Five days... a week?
Fuck you, I don't have 5 days!
I got hours.
My guys are working on it.
You're always working on it,
You can't get me up there.
I don't know why you try
sending people up there,
they just get fucking shot down.
Not with what's in your head!
That's what I'm talking about!
We would control the system.
We would be in charge!
We can change the course
of fucking history!
Back up there...
What I have in my head,
is worth a lot to them, right?
Don't do this.
If it falls into the wrong hands,
they could shut us out for good.
Listen, man,
I'm going up there right now.
If you can find me, and I'm healed,
you can have all of this.
- But I'm not fucking dying.
- This is wrong, Max, don't do this.
Do not shoot him! Do not shoot him!
Let go!
It's okay. It's okay.
I always wanted a wife.
Just couldn't quite settle down,
you know? Too much temptation.
But you...
You make me ready to settle down.
You really make me want to
settle down, baby.
- Holy shit, sir.
- Eh?
You better come
take a look at this.
- What is it?
- Check this fucking oak (guy).
Turn us around.
-Take it.
-Right, sir.
Open the door.
Stop right there, and you're
gonna do exactly what I say.
Or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off, understand?
Yeah!
You can have everything in my head!
Just take me up there,
and get me in a med-bay.
- What I have is very valuable.
- We can fix you up.
Put you in a med-bay,
Sort all this fuck-up.
Let's go!
We'll take you up there.
Weather's nice, air's nice and clean.
Likely you'll dig it.
- Don't you fucking try anything!
- Step aboard!
Come meet the boys, come on!
Don't be shy, they won't bite.
Let me introduce you.
This is Drakie. This is Max.
What is news?
Let's fly!
Yes, ma'am, we apprehended the subject.
- Open the skies, we're coming in.
- I'll expect you in 19 minutes.
- Cancel the No Fly Zone.
- Yes, ma'am.
Hold it...
Hold it. What is that? ...
Are we back? Marcelo!
What the fuck is that? Are we back?
- We're back online.
- Alright.
Frey...
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make this right.
- We've got him.
- Alright. Where is he?
Leaving Earth...
Heading to Elysium.

All because of your inability to act.
Evacuate him.

That puts CCB under my control.
