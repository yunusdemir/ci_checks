A film by
Marcel Camus
Serafina, look how beautiful!
No!
Sorry
l am very sorry, but
you really scared me
Oh, child... are you shaking?
Poor thing...
l can feel your heart
beating... right here...
in your hand,
like a trapped bird
Let me give you something
that will help you forget
Here. lt's not very pretty
lt is very pretty, indeed.
Thank you very much
Let me help you
if you don't mind
but l won't be able to
guide you. l don't know Rio
l'll manage. l know this city
like the palm of my hand
l may even point you in the
right direction, if you wish
Let's go
Onions... onions
Would you like a steak?
Wonderful
Wonderful. Shall we
stroll around? Shall we?
The biggest necklaces,
here, the biggest necklaces
Hey, girl, let's go!
Are you done, Orpheus?
Go get your paycheck
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
l was told to go to
the end of the line
-So? You're looking at it
-Thank you
-Are you from around here?
-No
-Where are you going?
-To my cousin's house
Well, then it's OK
Take care of this girl, Hermes.
She's looking for her cousin
He'll find your cousin
for you. He finds everything
l must go and get my paycheck
Another one for the collection.
Nice girl
-She is naive.
-Yeah, right. l know you
-Watch out, Mira is around.
Sorry to break up your party.
Are you telling her fortune?
-Why not?
-No way!
With her looks, she'll only
have bad luck
You're too much of a show-off
to deserve good luck
Are you coming?
She is crazy
-Have you been to carnival?
-No, l have not
-ls that why you came?
-No
You'll end up going.
No one can resist the madness
See? There is no mistake
Just follow this path and
you'll find the place
-Thank you very much.
-My name is Hermes
lf you get lost again,
please come back
l'm always here, l am
the station guard
Thanks. Some day
l'll be back
You're loaded! Hand it
over, let me see it
Did you get the directions?
Yes, thanks
-Do you know her?
-No
-Why so much fuss then?
-Because l am very kind
-Kind?!
-lsn't she cute?
-What about me? Let's go!
-Where to?
See, Hermes? He is cynical to
the point of asking ''where to''
Don't you remember that
we are getting married?
-Pay attention, man!
-What eyes she has!
And l have a good
memory, you know?
l know! Poor guy!
Enough!
-Where is the fifth forum?
-1 st floor, 2nd door, right side
Take your hat off!
Fix your tie. What a mess
Let me fix it, let me
-Give me a kiss.
-There's people coming
Come
Marriage license?
Sorry! lt's for tomorrow
No, for today.
We want a license
-We want to get married, right?
-Are you sure?
-Of course! Why do you ask?
-Sorry, l was just kidding
l said that because everybody
comes here to get married
lt is quite funny
Names? What is your name?
-Orpheus.
-Orpheus
Obviously, the bride's
name must be Eurydice
My name is not Eurydice.
Why do you say that?
Because everybody knows that
Orpheus loves Eurydice
Do you love some woman
called Eurydice?
l don't know any
Eurydice! What is this?
Nothing... nothing. That's
an old story. Just kidding
That's not funny at all!
l'm not interested in
these old stories, Orpheus
My name is Mira
Let's go, Mira!
Are you happy now?
You got what you wanted
-Are you buying me a ring?
-What ring?
Now that we are engaged,
you must give me a ring
-With what money?
-You did get your paycheck!
-You won't do it? -l've got
to get my guitar out of hock
That's what interests me.
Tomorrow is carnival. A ring?
-Silly! Buy your own ring!
-No, you have to give it to me!
l told you,
l have no money!
-l can loan you some.
-All right!
But you're the one who has
to get me a ring! Come on!
-What else do you want?
-First my guitar!
1 04...
31 0...
1 02...
340...

Orpheus... Orpheus
You will look
beautiful as a king!
l am the king!
Leave it here on the bench...
Enough
-What is this? -These crooks
aren't interested...
-All right, all right.
-Hold it. Look, it works well!
This relic is worth much
more than 1 00 cruzeiros...
Any museum would pay alot
for this. And it plays well
l just need the 1 00 cruzeiros
l just want 1 00 cruzeiros for
carnival. lt plays well
l know. Here are the 1 00
cruzeiros, and take this away!
-1 00 cruzeiros! Great!
-Take this devil away!
No, now it belongs to you
You think that's funny, huh?
You made a good deal
-Hold this piece of junk!
-Hold on...
Hold this
Don't get mad, all right?
lsn't it a beauty?
-lt is beautiful, indeed.
-Yes, but you owe me 1 1 0 bucks
-What?
-One hundred and ten!
Are you sad, birdy?
He didn't come
He will come.
Sing, bird. Sing!
-Bread! -l spent
all my money on a costume
Chico! Chico!
Oh... lt's you!
-Good morning.
-Good morning. Come in
You're the last thing l expected.
l thought it was him
-Him?
-Chico Boto! You don't know him
What a man.
He travels all the time
But he promised to
be here for carnival
-Your husband?
-No, why?
We just like each other.
And l'm all his!
You should see what
a chest he has
lt doesn't mean that
l'm not happy to see you!
Actually, since he's not
here, it's quite convenient
Let me guess...
You came for carnival!
-l ran away.
-Ran away?
-l'm scared, Serafina!
-You? Scared?
Of what? Of whom?
A man who come to the farm
and kept chasing after me
-Because you're beautiful,
silly! -No
-l'm sure he wants to kill me.
-Are you crazy, girl?
He just wants to get into
your pants, don't you see?
No... he wants to kill me.
l know he does
l know. Listen and answer me.
Does he know you're here?
-No.
-Then, forget about that! Come
You must be starving. All l have
is onions. Do you have money?
Never mind. l'm asking because
my costume was expensive
Forget it. The Portuguese grocer
will do anything for a kiss
You are really very beautiful!
Good trick
Good morning, Benedito.
How are you?
-ls that amulet for me?
-No, it is for her
-You don't even know her!
-Now l will. Do you want...
-Thank you, Benedito.
-You already know my name?
My name is Eurydice.
l'll keep this forever
-Even after l die?
-That's nonsense. Come on
That boy is full of strange
ideas. Let's go, come on!
Give me a kiss
-Enough! Only one.
-And you?
-A fish.
-Fish... fish... fish
Something makes me think
you came with no money
Exactly! l bring you customers
like myself- bold ones
You'll be flexible, won't you?
My pretty little fatso...
One more, please
You are terrible! Always asking
for credit, and now this!
No way! Nobody owes me money!
Here! This should hold
you for a little while
That's much better.
What about her?
lt looks like she's not
used to this... poor thing!
-What about you? No kiss?
-No way! l rather pay!
That's too bad, since her man...
This woman is
much smarter than you
-Forget it! That's just talk.
-Everybody knows that
lf he's really getting married,
poor thing!
lt's time now.
They are arriving
Take anything you want!
ls everybody crazy?
You're not going to see him?
Who?
She doesn't know him yet.
When she does, she'll run
even faster than the others.
Are you taking that?
No way, that's green!
Green, green- of course!
Did you want a red chayote?
This can't be! Poor baby!
You're getting hitched?
She's really serious
Do you want me to get rid of
your little fiancée? May l?
-How did you do it?
-He insisted
l'm so happy!
-You're suffocating me! -l'm
happy for you! Give me a hug
-What's going on?
-Oh, it's you! Nothing
Sorry. l must tune
the guitar for the rehearsal
-Orpheus! Orpheus!
-Later... later!
-He doesn't want it.
-Didn't l tell you?
-You're an idiot!
-My costume is cool
So beautiful
-Where is Orpheus?
-He left already?
Yes, he said we should meet
at the rehearsal
He could at least have told me
You know, he is so shaken,
poor thing
Let me see your ring again
-What a beauty! ls it real?
-Almost
lt looks great, doesn't it?
Orpheus, will you dance with me?
Yes. Soon, at the rehearsal
How is everybody?
How are you, Caruso?
You two... always cuddling, huh?
-Would you ask him?
-No, you ask him
l would like to
ask you something
ls it true that you make the
sun rise by playing guitar?
-Of course l do!
-Didn't l tell you?
Could you make the
sun rise tomorrow?
Sure! Even better, since
tomorrow is carnival!
What do you play to
do that?
-l make it up.
-And you? Could you?
l could make up a melody!
l'd love to make the sun rise
Give him the guitar.
Just to ckeck it out
This is a very old guitar...
-''Orpheus is my master''.
-Yes, that's true
There was an Orpheus before me.
And one may come after l'm gone
but l'm the one ruling now.
Do you understand that?
Don't be sad.
Don't tell anybody, OK?
l will play a new song
l just wrote
Pretty, isn't it?
-What are you doing here?
-l have the right to...
Zeca, take the guitar!
You didn't see me!
-lsn't he here?
-Who?
Was that you playing?
Orpheus taught me
Where is he?
He just left with a woman
What?
Since you have the guitar,
play something
He'll hear me
That's even better. Play
You again? What are
you doing here?
Why didn't you tell me that
Serafina is your cousin?
So, we are close.
What's your name?
Don't you remember?
l'm Eurydice
Wonderful! l like you already!
Of course! Orpheus likes
Eurydice, as the story goes
Are you Orpheus?
-Yes, l am. From head to toe.
-But l... l don't like you
Yes, you do! Try to remember.
This is really an old story
Thousands of years ago, Orpheus
was sad and melancholic
like the bird
trapped in this cage
One day, from the strings of a
guitar, sought by only one love,
a voice spoke of lost kisses
from the lips of Eurydice
And Eurydice's lips were
trembling with anxiety...
and the perfumed flower of
her mouth opened slightly
No! You are too
young to remember
Yes... l remember
the words you sang...
-because they are the same!
-Exactly!
But it was the melody
l liked best
Forgive me, Eurydice
Look
l need to talk to him
No, leave them alone!
Orpheus, they're waiting
for you at the rehearsal!
Yes!
Well... l need to go
l know
l'll sing and dance for you!
-Are you coming?
-Yes, l am
Take good care of her!
Let's go!
See you later
Thanks
Why aren't you paying any
attention to me?
l have no time now
-Answer me!
-Go back to your place!
l'm sorry. He already
saw you. He and the sun
Look at Serafina.
She is the Queen of Night
Look how happy she is
-And who is she?
-Her?
That's Mira. She plays
the Queen of Day
-She is pretty, isn't she?
-Yes
She is Orpheus' fiancée
Look, he's going to kiss her
-OK, that's enough!
-What's so funny?
-Nothing! That's enough!
-Why didn't you kiss me?
Leave me alone. Have you tried
on your costumes?
Of course! Mira's costume
is a beauty, isn't it?
lt has embroidered sleeves.
Let's go see it
Come and dance, Eurydice, come
Come on!
-And who is that?
-Ask Orpheus!
-l want a costume for her, OK?
-OK, all right
When it comes to women,
nobody is better than you!
Leave me alone!
She is pretty! Hot girl
-lsn't she better than Mira?
-Much better! A real beauty!
-She has good taste.
-Drop it!
-So what? So what?
-Where is the costume?
That's all we have. A woman
like this doesn't need costumes
-Hold on, let me look next door.
-No
-That's right, you're with Mira.
-Why are you talking about her?
lt's nothing... nothing
You don't waste any time,
do you?
Shall l introduce my cousin?
Be good now. Take care of her.
l want a pretty costume for her
-Oh, you!
-Seriously
You don't even know her!
Yes, l do
Look at me
Look at me!
Oh, boy!
Don't make faces! This is not
tragic. l'll take care of it
People, leave the girl alone!
l'll take care of her!
-l will help!
-lt's high time!
Don't just stand there!
Move! Go!
Quickly, quickly!
l'll take care of her
-Orpheus, is Eurydice here?
-Yes. Why?
-Eurydice, someone's
looking for you! -Who?
-A man.
-Who is he?
l don't know.
He's not from around here
-Who is it?
-Don't be afraid
Tell him she's left.
She's gone
What are you waiting for?
No!
No!
Calm down. Calm down!
Calm down! There's nothing
to be afraid of!
Take care of her!
What happened?
-Eurydice! She got scared!
-Eurydice? -My cousin
-Her name is Eurydice?
-She has the right
Orpheus!
What happened, Benedito?
l tried to catch him, but
he threw me on the ground
-Where did he go?
-l don't know. That way
That's impossible!
There is a cliff there!
-The man fled that way.
-That way?
What's wrong with him?
-Take care of him.
-Orpheus! What happened?
Who is this Eurydice woman?
Are you sleeping with her?
-No! Let me go!
-Stay here!
No!
lf you go...
So, you chased him away?
Eurydice!
ls that you? Serafina!
Answer me!
Eurydice!
Where are you?
ldiot! You scared me!
You're the one hiding,
and l scared you?
-Where is my cousin?
-Your cousin?
-Yes, my cousin!
-Ah, she was your cousin?
-You scared her too, right?
-Who, me?
Fine! l need to find her!
Hold it! l came from
Montevideo to see you!
She'll find her way
-Where is Eurydice?
-He saw her, but she ran off
Where to?
-Answer, man!
-Don't know! That way
He'll find her
Chico!
-Chico, my love!
-You're strangling me!
No!
No! He'll kill you!
He'll kill you!
Take care of her
l am not in a hurry
We shall meet soon
So long
You are in my arms, Eurydice
l will protect you forever...
against everything
l like you, Eurydice
You will never feel
scared again... never
Chico Boto has arrived.
Do you want to stay here?
Yes
You won't be scared here.
They're great
He will protect you too.
He is a beast!
And then...
then there is me
-Let go!
Orpheus!
l swear l heard people
talking. Didn't you?
-lt was the dog.
-Talking?
No. So what?
Gimme
-She is in good hands.
-Who?
-My cousin.
-Your cousin? Didn't she run off?
Dummy! Open your mouth
and close your eyes
More! More!
The dog ripped one of
the little animals
They're not animals,
they're signs of the zodiac
lt's beautiful
That's where l was born.
lt's my house in heaven
A baby sheep?
l'll rent the one right next to
it, so l'll always be near you
Should l?
Good night
Good night
l'll sleep outside. lt's closer
to my house... and yours
Good night, Eurydice
One... two... three...
four... five
-They're playing.
-l hope they will let us sleep
Come!
Come on!
Got you!
You haven't gotten me yet
Did l hurt you?
Poor thing!
-ls it still hurting?
-No. lt's better
Wait!
Ah, Chico! l won, didn't l?
You always win
Let's go... it's time.
Hurry! Hurry!
All right... l'm coming
lt's too early to get up, boy.
Let us sleep in peace!
-Close that door!
-Yes, yes, gramma
Let's go, it's late already
What are these devils
doing at this hour?
Quiet, Caruso!
He won't find it.
We better tell him
Yeah, right! Come on, let's see
What if he's asleep?
l'll knock on the door
What did l tell you?
Look... it's rising
lt's true
Serafina,
where is your costume?
Chico is here!
He is always hungry!
-You look beautiful!
-Wait, let me get Orpheus!
No, l'm in a hurry.
l will run ahead
Thanks
-Are you getting married today?
-Orpheus forgot
Why? Didn't he invite you?
Eurydice!
Ah, Eurydice
You were here? Quick!
Get your costume on, quick!
No. Quick. No, no...
not there, no... that way
-ln a hurry, aren't we?
-Mira... she's coming
So what if she's coming?
Come, dear.
Aren't you ready?
-No... l'm in no hurry.
-ls he out of his mind?
-Orpheus, you promised me.
-l'll keep your scarf
God, he's silly! How did you
get him to be like that?
You're awake already!
At least say good morning!
-Who is that?
-My cousin
Your cousin?
Let's not start with that
again, OK? Go to sleep!
-l'm hungry.
-Wait!
Eat, eat, eat all the time!
Here, eat and shut up!
God Almighty!
What can l do? l like him
lt happens to everybody.
Look at you
Wow! You look great!
What am l going to drink?
Here, but l don't want
to see you again
-Nice costume.
-lt was Orpheus' idea
-Happy you.
-Me?
Carnival is very nice, child,
but tomorrow Chico leaves again
Here, button this down
-l'd rather fool around with him.
-l'd rather dance with Orpheus
lncredible!
What if you were to
dance in my place?
-No!
-Yes! That's it!
-Orpheus, open the door!
-l'm coming, l'm coming
What are you doing?
Can't you see? Look
Am l pretty?
-Yes.
-What's the matter?
You could at least look
Do you have a sore throat?
-Are you...
-Listen, Mira, l need to
New? Must be... What are
these animals on the scarf?
They are not animals.
They are zodiac signs
Zodiac signs! You don't say!
And the girl next door took you
to heaven last night, right?
Answer me!
Here! That's what l think
of this bitch's dirty rag
lt's her, isn't it?
-Shut up!
-You're afraid she will hear!
Listen, if l see her again with
you, l will kill her!
We came to help
you take the sun
l will wait for you outside
Here. My tambourine
You look very pretty, you know?
Who was screaming next door?
-Nobody.
-Was that Mira?
-Since you already know...
-Orpheus told me everything
-He promised to talk to her.
-l understand
-Aren't you coming, Serafina?
-Yes, l'm coming!
She is going to be mad
-Quick, put your veil down.
-Now?
Now! Otherwise Mira will think
l've been playing tricks on her
She is no good
l'm coming! Chico, wake up and
give my cousin a kiss, quick!
-Your cousin?
-Yes!
-That's her!
-You win the smart prize!
Now she is me, and you will kiss
her as if she were me, OK?
-Kiss her?
-Yes, her!
No, not here. At the door!
l'm coming! Soon! Soon!
Kiss her! Hard!
Enough!
Say something to her!
-Like what?
-What? How, what?
What... what... what
But l don't know your cousin!
-Look at Serafina's costume.
-Too much veil, not enough face!
For Serafina, that's an
advantage, trust me!
Orpheus, are you going to
stand there forever? Let's go!
Ask Serafina if Eurydice
is coming. Run!
Serafina, Orpheus wants to
know if Eurydice is coming
Why do you have her amulet?
-ls it a secret?
-Yes. Only Orpheus may know it
l'll run and tell him
to wait for you
Come, Zeca, let's
help hold the rope
Didn't even notice it
-What?
-Don't know, look at Serafina
-l love you.
-And l love you, Orpheus
Let's go, it is our turn!
-Do you love me?
-Dance in your spot!
Answer me!
l wanted to explain before.
Now it's too late. Go!
Zeca, look! Death!
That's nothing.
Just a masked man
Look!
My amulet!
Eurydice!
Watch out!
Catch it, Benedito!
Why did you choose Serafina
to dance in my place?
Not now. The Jury
is calling me! Come, Lourdes!
Thank you, thanks... everybody
deserves... look, look
l will kill you!
No!
ldiot!
Eurydice, Eurydice
What happened, child?
Calm down, calm down
-He wants to kill me!
-Don't cry! Come on
He is going to kill me!
Go to my house.
You'll be safe there
-l'll tell Orpheus.
-No, l am so scared
Calm down, child.
Let me look for him
You know the way
Go, my child
Don't worry, go... l will tell
Orpheus right away. Go!
No!!
Eurydice! Where are you?
Eurydice!
Orpheus!
Orpheus!
Eurydice!
Now she is mine!
lt's OK... it's nothing
No, it's
-lt's over, Orpheus!
-Eurydice!
She is dead, Orpheus!
-No! l want to see Eurydice!
-You can only see her dead
-No!
-She was sent to the morgue
No, she is alive!
l'm going to find her!
lt's true, Orpheus. Wait!
-May l go?
-Yes
Wait , Orpheus! Orpheus!
-They are all like that at first.
-No!
They really liked each other
Really... does that exist?
lt does
Orpheus, wait for me!
l'd like some information
Are you family? Then
you can't stay here
lt is forbidden.
You can't come in
Stop, stop!
You can't go up!
Go, go- Go away!
lt went up
Stop!
What do you want?
What are you doing here?
-Nothing.
-Then, please leave
lt's forbidden and we
have no time to waste
Don't be sad, Orpheus
lt's over...
lt's all over
Hold this bitch!
-l know him.
-l know this guy
-Are you Orpheus, from Babylon?
-Yes, l am
He is incredible!
The best! Great singer!
Sing something for us! The one
you sang for us... how was it?
Sing, man!
What's your problem?
-l'm looking for a lost person.
-That's not here
These are soccer fans.
Missing Persons, 1 2th floor
-Where is that?
-l'll show you. Come here
Show me that step
That thing... that one.
Something like that
OK, go... get out of here
Get out of here!
Go away!
Anybody there?
What are you looking
for, brother?
Missing Persons
There is such a section...
but l never saw any missing
people there. Just paper
That's Missing Persons
See? Nobody there...
but lots of paper, see?
The house is full.
1 5 floors of paper...
for nothing
Can you read?
-Yes.
-l can't
Feel free to look
around, if you wish...
but you will not find
missing people in papers
On the contrary, that's
where they get lost
Are you suffering, my brother?
l lost Eurydice
lt's as if she were
burning inside my heart
Keep calling... She will come
l am calling
You alone... that's
not strong enough...
and these papers will
not give you an answer
Do you think paper
cares for anybody?
Let's go, my brother.
l know where to take you
Let's go
Sweeping, or not sweeping,
there is always more paper
Come, Orpheus
Quiet! Calm down,
Cerberus... calm down
Calm down, Cerberus
That's how it goes.
She received the spirit
Call her...
Sing, Orpheus!
Sing, Orpheus... go ahead!
Sing, Orpheus!
Eurydice!
Eurydice!
Where are you, Eurydice?
l love you, Eurydice, but l want
to see you! My arms are empty!
l want to see you, to hold
you close to me
You are not there.
You are tricking me!
No!
l want to see you!
Orpheus, you're killing me!
Farewell, Orpheus.
You'll never see me again
No! You lied to me!
Why did you do that to me?
-You lied to me.
-Calm down, Orpheus. Don't leave!
Hermes, that's him. lt is him!
lt's me. Hermes also came
l've nothing left in life
l am poorer than the
poorest of the black men
Seek mercy, my son.
We are all poor and...
what's left to be said is the
poor people's word- thanks
l ask you for mercy, Hermes
All l can do is give
you mercy
Here. l have already done
everything that had to be done
l think that you'll
get true mercy there
Thank you, Hermes
No, my son. You are
going to thank Eurydice
Yes
Are you going
to take her yourself?
All right.
Come with me
lf you don't want it,
it's always interesting...
having another cadaver for
the doctors, for science
And it is also cheaper for you
lt is my duty to ask that
question, because of them...
and, the truth is,
when one is here...
Carnival is over, there
is nothing one can do
Would you like to try
and identify her?
Careful, you'll get a
cold dressed like that
Death is cheap here, right?
Everything is
beautiful, Eurydice
My heart is a bird whose thirst
is quenched by a drop of dew
Thank you, Eurydice.
Thank you for this new day
You are the one who carries me
l am in your arms,
like a sleeping child
The sweet breath of your chest
l know you will take me
where l must go
Thank you, Eurydice. The path
you chose is full of flowers
The sun is rising to
embrace us, my love
You are singing, Eurydice
Mira!
No! No! No!
Zeca!
Hurry! Hurry!
-Play and make the sun rise!
-l don't know how!
-Sure, you know.
-l don't know if l can!
Make it up!
-Come on, play!
-l don't know
You do know, come on!
He plays well, doesn't he?
What are you looking at?
Shut up!
He is making the sun rise!
He made the sun rise!
Wow! Just like Orpheus!
-Now you are Orpheus.
-No
Yes. Take this little flower
Play a song for me, please
Come on!
