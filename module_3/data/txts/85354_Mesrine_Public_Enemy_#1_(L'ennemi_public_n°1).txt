MESRINE: KILLER INSTINCT
BASED ON THE BOOK <i>L'INSTINCT DE MORT</i>
BY JACQUES MESRINE.
Think of that.
I was born not a mile away.
Yeah, yeah.
- Let him pass.
- Pass.
ALGERIA, 1959
Where is the bomb hidden?
I can't.
It's all right, brother.
Brahim, look at me.
Brahim.
It'll be all right.
Look at me.
Think of your family.
- My God.
- He can't help you.
Stop!
Shut the fuck up!
Mesrine.
Why are you crying?
You will talk, asshole!
Look at your brother.
Want a cigarette?
Brahim, it's nothing.
We all die.
I love you.
Come on, tell me where the bomb is.
Don't smoke.
Easy, easy.
I swear, I can't say.
Where is the bomb?
Mohamed, don't say a word.
Yasmina!
Where's the bomb?
Don't talk to them! Don't!
Don't talk to them!
You shut up.
Look at me.
Long live Algeria!
I'll take care of her.
Let her go, you dog!
I'll kill you!
She's my sister!
Let's go, Mesrine.
Long live Algeria.
The girl.
Do it.
Come on!
Do it, Mesrine!
Go ahead.
Do it!
Where's the bomb, son of a bitch?
<i>The army's role...</i>
<i>is crucial.</i>
<i>Intellectually,</i>
<i>socially, morally,
Algeria is in gestation.</i>
<i>In that place,
a young generation is forming,</i>
<i>including those who fought
on both sides.</i>
<i>A generation</i>
<i>which would like to found and foster</i>
an Algeria...
<i>a new and modern one,</i>
<i>a fraternal one.</i>
<i>That transformation,</i>
<i>I repeat, France began</i>
<i>to accomplish it</i>
<i>alongside Algerians.</i>
<i>This magnificent piece of work</i>
<i>demands</i>
<i>an effort from every Algerian.</i>
Your father got you a job.
Really?
Yes.
With Darquer.
Lace?
Right, lace.
Good company. Steady.
And... if you like it,
you can plan on
a good future.
Thank you.
Jacky!
Jacky!
Come down!
Wait. I'll be right down.
Back later.
- I have the keys.
- Your dinner!
Delicious.
You have money?
- How's the rebel soldier?
- Quit it.
Jacky boy.
So? Algeria?
Leave it where it is.
But you...
judging by your car,
you're doing all right.
Can't complain.
You know how it is.
Odd jobs, off the books.
- I don't know. Tell me.
- I will.
So.
Where are we going?
- Where?
- Yeah.
Pedal to the metal!
Crowded, huh?
It's always crowded.
This is Jacques.
I'm Jacques. Nice to meet you.
This is incredible.
- As beautiful as ever.
- Yes, that's true.
Ladies!
Sweetie, you be very nice
to my friend.
That depends.
Jacques!
Come here a sec.
A hunk.
This is my honey, Suzon.
Sarah.
And Sarah!
Have we already met somewhere?
You don't come for free?
Only when I'm paid to.
You'll pay me!
You're a good honey,
but you can't dodge the bill.
Want to bet?
- Hey, Jacky!
- How are you?
We've been waiting!
- Some of us have to work.
- Ride your pony here?
You know Mario?
Who's dealing? Here's my salary.
My deal.
Can I drop you off?
I'll go home alone.
But I'm tapped out.
Lend me the cab fare?
Here.
Come on.
Sure?
This is good.
Paul?
That off-the-books work...
- Not hiring?
- Yeah, we're hiring.
Jam it in good and shove.
All right.
Safe, behind the bookshelf.
Behind the...
Check out the hardware!
Gramps has got a smokepole.
Ali Baba's cave! Your mark is loaded.
Holy cow!
Something's not right.
What's that?
What is this? Who are you?
- Is this your house?
- Yes.
Glad you're here.
Detectives Binard
and Geralbet.
Criminal Division.
I'm afraid you've been burglarised.
Edouard!
Yes. Wait till you see what those
hoodlums did to your bedroom!
My jewellery!
Calm down.
I'm very sorry.
We noticed you own a firearm.
They're heirlooms.
Yes, but firearms require
a carry permit.
Bring it to the 8th precinct.
- Where did I put them?
- Find them.
- Daniel? Got the prints?
- All done.
Fine. Let's get to the lab.
Edouard! Look at this!
Better calm her down.
Calm down, Marie-Laure.
See you at 9 AM tomorrow
at the 16th precinct.
Hey.
So easy. Got more like that?
Plenty!
You should meet my supplier.
- Who?
- Guido.
Hey, Guido.
That's him. Jacques Mesrine.
Jacques Mesrine.
Paul told me lots about you.
Lots.
Have a seat.
You! Still bringing me
every stray dog
you find on the street?
Guido...
- You mean me?
- Not you.
I asked a question!
Answer me?
Yeah, what?
Calling me a stray dog?
What are you barking about?
You better have an army behind you.
He bites.
My army is well known.
The Secret Army Organisation, SAO.
We hit where and when we want.
All I see is a fat man talking.
Parents never taught you respect?
I'll teach you, kid.
You'll need more than sweat
in your hand.
Looking for this?
It happens
when you let just anybody
feel you up.
Where's my respect?
- Where?
- All right, keep cool.
Relax, I'm not that crazy.
You seem like an intelligent kid.
So let me give you some advice.
Friend to friend.
In our business, you don't win.
After a whole career,
if you do well,
you'll have this.
And you'd be lucky.
Understand, Mesrine?
Thanks for...
the advice. I'll remember.
Meanwhile,
if this is really friend to friend,
call me Jacques.
OK, Jacques.
Whatever you say. Here.
Jacques Mesrine.
I want to be yours.
Again?
I got a man, you know?
Pay him off, I could work for you.
Are you crazy? What is this?
What do I look like?
A pimp?
- Is that it?
- No.
I don't need you.
I know where my money comes from.
Don't take it like that, big guy.
- I like you, Sarah.
- So do I.
But watch how you talk to me.
Your boss called.
So?
You haven't worked in a week.
- So?
- So!
Your father gets you a job.
This is his thanks?
What's the problem? Explain.
Leave me the hell alone, Mum.
A real man makes an honest living.
He starts a family.
He's respected by neighbours.
Talk to your son.
Your mother and I want you to stay.
This is your home.
"Your mother and I..."
Can't you for once say "I"?
What's eating you?
What's eating Jacques
is seeing his dad
act like a doormat.
And, hey, I can't swallow it.
That you worked for the Germans.
Anyway, I wish just once
I could be proud of my father.
You get that? Just once!
I never worked for the Germans.
It was the Obligatory Work Programme.
Obligatory? There's no such thing!
Was it obligatory
when I enlisted for Algeria?
Tell me.
What is it with this fucking family?
Do balls skip a generation?
SPAIN 1960
This is nice.
Hey, I don't lie.
Welcome wagon!
Excuse me.
- How are you?
- Very well?
He said "chorizo"?
- The blonde!
- The blonde?
The brunette!
Know Paris?
What?
Men have to...
Me.
Paris.
France.
The Eiffel Tower.
Wait.
How do you say a kiss?
A <i>beso.</i>
Oh, a kiss!
A little <i>beso.</i>
I want to <i>beso</i> you.
Not here.
No, please.
But we could go outside.
We can.
If you want.
Or we could dance.
Go outside, or dance.
Whatever you want.
I come back. OK?
I travelo...
Want to "dansar"?
It's "bailar".
Fine. Want to "bailar"?
Sofia! Yes.
Want to?
Sure!
In Spain we dance.
In France, no "bailar" much.
Sofia, the room...
In the blue building.
Ten.
If you want to dance some more.
- Why?
- Because no.
It's the first time.
What?
The first time.
The first time?
Yes.
Sofia...
Jacques! Hey!
Sure, but hey!
We got a long way to go!
Let's go!
I must go.
Goodbye, Jacques.
Hey, let's go.
See you.
Goodbye!
Why would Sarah come to this ghetto?
Her pimp just got out of jail.
She does as she's told.
Hang on.
What's that piece for?
- Like you go around light?
- Yeah, I do.
If I carry, I draw.
If I draw, I fire. So no thanks.
- This it?
- Yeah.
Good evening.
Something to drink?
Yeah. It's a bar, isn't it?
- Scotch.
- Two.
Sarah's not here?
She won't be long.
Sarah's unavailable.
But Mado's here.
Go ahead, honey.
I'll pass on Mado.
- Hi. Buy me a drink?
- Shove off!
Just one drink.
I said shove off.
Hey, Gégé.
You let fags in your bar now?
Get lost!
Hey, you.
Where's your manners?
Well, pimps?
Who wants to make a move?
Jacques! Why'd you come here?!
Leave it. Don't you touch!
Oh, my darling.
What are you doing?
Look what you did to him!
- Whoring for an Arab dog?
- So? He's my man!
Get out!
Go. I didn't ask for anything.
You disgust me.
What a sweet couple.
Get away!
Come on.
Get away!
Sorry, baby.
Sarah?
Fuck.
Get in the back.
Your nose is still a bit swollen.
It's nothing.
Tell me,
how's Sarah doing?
Don't worry.
I worked it outwith Guido.
You'll get a deal on the girl.
After all, it's true.
I did sort of break her.
Ahmed.
You do look sweet.
That little suit...
is perfect.
Right, Guido?
- Good-looking suit.
- Nice. Very sweet.
Yeah, I like it.
Like a good Frenchman.
Good Frenchman, yeah.
What do you say to an Arab
wearing a suit?
- You know, Guido?
- No. What do you say?
You say...
"Defendant, please rise!"
Good one.
What's an Arab in a trash can?
A waste! You can fit three in there!
Little rats.
We're just joking.
He's just kidding.
We're not like that.
Easier with women, huh?
Son of a bitch.
- Guido! You're a dog!
- Shut your face!
You gave your word!
I'll kill you!
What's a promise to an Arab?
Shut up!
Shut up!
Here, I'll light his face.
Look at that ugly face!
Untie me. Untie me.
Men get one to the head.
You... die like a bitch.
How much did you want for her?
How much?
How much did you want for Sarah?
How much?
Bitch.
- Flush.
- He had a flush.
What's that?
Quit it.
You're married?
- Married?
- Yeah.
- You got married?
- Yeah, enough.
Guido, you hear this?
Crazy fuck got married.
She's knocked up.
What could I do?
Knocked up. Married.
He's doubly fucked. Nice.
Enough, enough.
Serve us, or we'll serve ourselves!
What is this?
Set them up! Move your ass!
What is this? Got a problem here?
Who are you?
Owner? The fat whore's son?
Serve them. They're nervous.
And move your ass!
There you go.
It's all right. Relax.
Keep playing. It's over.
That's for the drinks.
And that's for respect.
How long does this take?
Depends. Eight, ten hours.
- Depends.
- Ten hours!
Yeah, it depends. Maybe more.
Now that you have a kid,
you'll be going straight?
We'll see.
Times change, men don't.
And me least of all.
Good.
Remember the cripple?
The cripple?
The guy you shot both knees off.
Oh, the cripple. Sure.
The cripple.
What's the cripple want?
Nothing.
He sent two friends around,
asking questions about you.
What friends? Serious friends?
Yeah, serious.
But, hey.
They can't touch you
without my permission.
There you are.
- So it's OK.
- Yeah.
Well...
What are they doing?
Pushing!
Mr Mesrine.
That's me.
Guido, that's me!
A beautiful little girl.
Beautiful.
How are you?
She's so tiny.
What's going on?
You were with friends and whores?
Yeah, that's true.
Hang on.
I haven't finished.
I was with my friends. So what?
No whores?
Why would I, when I have you?
A bank in Neubourg.
Only two employees. And get this.
No vault. They have no vault!
All the money in a locked cabinet.
How easy is that?
You're not coming?
No.
- Why not?
- I'm going with Guido.
Don't. You know I'd rather be there.
Like Paul said,
we can do this bank one-handed.
In and out.
Like rabbits fucking.
As long as only rabbits get fucked.
I'm in.
To the rabbits!
EVREUX PRISON, 1962
Well?
Dad?
She said Dad?
Dad?
Yes, my love.
I'm your dad.
You said it, you said Dad.
That's good.
That's the first time.
I don't know what to do.
Meaning?
I called my father and mother.
They told me...
to go back to my country.
What is this shit?
That's why you came?
To tell me you're leaving
with my daughter?
Is that it?
Sofia, look at me.
Is that what you mean?
I love you.
You're my wife.
I need you, both of you.
Call my parents.
They'll take care of you. Don't worry.
You're like their daughter.
- Understand?
- Yes.
That's Mummy.
Mummy.
She's pretty.
Your mummy's pretty.
<i>I just got out of prison.</i>
And I won't hide it,
I was in for armed robbery.
I have no references, simply because
I've lived on the edge since the army.
But I want to put that behind me,
start over from scratch.
I'm doing it for my parents,
for my wife,
for myself...
and especially my daughter.
I have a little girl.
Your past doesn't plead in your favour.
But I feel...
you're very sincere.
So if you like,
you can start tomorrow.
Really?
- Really.
- Thank you, Mr Tabacoff.
Let me show you the shop.
The models.
This way.
Hey, Jacques. Your Bruno's cute.
Does he cry at night?
Not really. Maybe a little.
It's OK.
- Does he cry at night?
- No.
You're sweet.
When he starts teething, we'll see.
We'll see.
- Three-grain couscous.
- I love couscous.
You should open a restaurant.
This is great.
Jacques has a steady, well-paid job.
He's doing just fine.
Don't worry, all is well.
Night.
Hey.
I got a great gig now.
Want to go back to work?
No, Guido.
Sofia is right.
I've got Sabrina and Bruno.
I've got this job.
I'll stick with that.
Oh yeah? You stick with that.
We'll see later.
Let me know.
- Jacques, got a second?
- Sure.
Look, right now I got big problems.
What's the matter?
I'm going to have to let
some of you go. But first...
I get it.
Wait.
No, it's natural.
Last hired, first fired.
- I haven't decided yet.
- Drop it.
Tabacoff,
you're a good man.
Don't worry about me.
There. I'm coming.
Where are you going?
- What?
- Stay.
You promised this was all over.
- Listen to me.
- You listen!
I have no time for this.
You said you wouldn't
go back to your friends.
Not now!
Now your friends are back.
Tomorrow come the whores!
What do you want?
For you to stay with us!
At my parents' house?
I lost my job.
I don't care. Just stay with us.
Enough. You'll wake Bruno.
Go with them, I call the police.
What was that?
Say that again.
There are words
you can't say in front of me.
You understand?
Come here.
See that?
- Open.
- Kill me.
Open your mouth!
Open!
Between you and my friends,
I choose them.
Got it?
Every time!
Got that in your little head?
Mummy.
Take care of your kid.
Big pile of shit.
Think I don't recognise you, Guido?
What a joke.
Know whose file you're after?
You're a dead man.
Shut up.
Scumbag.
Traitor.
Who sent you? Chevalier?
Shut up, traitor.
The SAO is over. A total loss.
De Gaulle killed us.
I've got it.
Why'd you do that?
Extending my life expectancy.
Any more questions?
Unarmed. Not right.
- And a gun in your wife's mouth?
- It's different.
All in.
Will you call or will you cave?
- Time, time.
- Time.
Don't. You'll lose your shirt.
Here.
What? I'll take your word.
Not your wedding ring.
She split anyway.
- Left me the three kids.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Looks like four-of-a-kind.
She can go fuck herself.
Who made a haul?
It's Mister Paul!
Who got it all?
Your good friend Paul!
Buy me a drink, handsome?
Drop it, Maggy.
The gentleman is with me.
Thanks.
What's your name?
Jeanne.
Like Jane? That's funny.
Me Tarzan.
But, well,
name's Jacques.
Nice to meet you.
Want a drink?
Isn't this a place
where men buy for women?
Got to break old habits.
I'm ready for anything.
So am I.
Really?
Yes.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Shut the fuck up!
- Nobody moves!
- Hands on the tables!
Hands on tables!
Shut up! I said hands on tables!
Calm your old lady down!
You, the money! Move it!
Let's go!
What's up with you?
Nobody make a sound.
Shut up!
Come on, hurry it up!
Jacques.
- You hit my place now?
- So what?
You won't go far.
Don't worry.
I'll go wherever I want.
For the personnel.
- Dad, why won't it work?
- Look, darling.
Keep the ball and the racket
nice and square.
See?
You all right?
- You hurt yourself.
- It's OK, darling.
I love you, Daddy.
In front of my daughter, Guido!
Fuck!
How far will you follow him?
All the way.
Of course.
If you love her, choose life.
Leave the country,
wait till it blows over.
What do we look like?
Like we'd run from those
shit-eating slobs?
The mob and the police
want you dead.
I can't cover you now.
Yeah, but...
My kid! Fuck, there are rules!
Rules?
What's that?
The only rule
is the law of the jungle.
Everybody's got principles, morals.
Hang on.
I got it.
Don't move. I had it.
Next time you draw,
shoot to kill!
All right.
Bye, Mum.
Come here.
Goodbye, Daddy.
I love you.
Come back soon.
- More, more, more.
- That's good.
That's good.
- Got it?
- Yeah.
Bring it up!
You're a dreamer, Frenchman.
Dangerous, at these heights.
Been here long?
Couple of months.
Like this job?
Prefer the one I had in France.
What was that?
I robbed banks.
Name's Jacques Mesrine.
You?
I'm Jean-Paul Mercier.
I help finance the FLQ.
Quebec Liberation Front.
Nice to meet you.
Same here.
Mr Mesrine,
because of your long criminal record,
I cannot approve your immigrant status.
So I request you leave the country
within 10 days.
My darling.
How did it go at Immigration?
It'll be fine.
Might take longer than expected.
After next week,
you can leave your job.
Yeah? How's that?
I answered a millionaire's ad.
He needs a couple.
A chauffeur and a housekeeper.
Do you really want to be a maid?
As long as I'm with you.
Mr Deslauriers,
Mrs Schneider and Mr. Mesrine.
Come in.
Hello.
I finally found you.
Jacques and Jeanne.
My guardian angels.
Well, is that a job offer?
More than that.
It's a veritable blessing!
In that case...
Thank you, Father.
One, two and...
three!
All right?
Here we go. Nice and easy.
No hurry.
There. It's all right, I'm here.
So...
Where are we going, sir?
Rue Saint Laurent.
Fine.
Two individuals inside.
Hello, gentlemen.
Why are you parked here?
On the job. A stakeout.
Right.
Hey.
Here, from Jacques.
Oh, shit, Jacques.
Once and for all,
stay out of my business!
Poor baby. Going to go crying
to Mr Deslauriers? Go ahead!
- I've been here 20 years.
- Get lost!
Move it.
- This doesn't end here.
- I'm so scared!
It's all right.
My gardener has just submitted
his resignation
over an altercation with you,
Miss Schneider.
You were disrespectful to him.
He's a dirty liar.
Be that as it may.
I've known him 20 years,
and he's served me loyally.
You I've known only three months.
So I'm less reluctant to let you go.
I'll give you two clays
to leave the premises.
Of course.
<i>We were astonished.
General De Gaulle</i>
<i>announced his decision</i>
<i>at 12:03 AM,</i>
<i>less than two hours after</i>
<i>official results
were announced and confirmed.</i>
<i>And the reaction in Paris?</i>
<i>In the Gaullist camp,
there's a feeling of depression.</i>
Oh, shit, I can't believe this.
What?
Jacques what?!
What did I do to you?
You were disrespectful, Georges.
To me and my wife.
What will you do to me?
First my wife and I
have your blessing?
Then just like that,
your asshole gardener gets us fired.
What are we, charity workers?
You'll cough it up, scumbag.
I'll teach you respect, count on me.
- My brother will pay.
- Maybe.
In the meantime, shut up. I'm watching TV.
Help me.
- Yeah, Jacques?
- What?
If you ask me, he won't come.
You believe that?
You'll see.
He's fucking with me.
That old bugger will cough it up.
He'll cough up the scratch,
believe me.
That's him.
Shit.
- What do we do?
- Look.
Shit.
End of the line.
We stop.
Too crowded.
French!
Tourist!
Fucking tourist!
I'm fucking French!

10 YEARS FOR MESRINE
5 FOR SCHNEIDER
One word for our TV viewers.
Just say something.
- Say anything.
- Look...
Record it, record it.
Long live free Quebec!
What the hell you want?
Number 5933, talking is prohibited
for the first two months in SCU.
I'm not 5933, I'm Mesrine.
Fuck you.
<i>Number 5933,
take that away from your face.</i>
I can't sleep with this light.
Leave me be.
<i>Take it away, 5933.</i>
Leave me alone!
Stop it! Stop it!
Your isolation is over, Mesrine.
Welcome
to the Special Corrections Unit.
I'm not dead.
Frenchman, I wouldn't.
You look good on TV.
Long live free Quebec!
Think you can get over
that barbed wire?
Mercier is in the hole.
Right where Gauthier
tortured you.
How is he?
You'll see. He gets out in two days.
See you round, Frenchman.
By the way, you were more fun on TV.
Good to see you, Jacques.
Don't give in. They're watching.
Here.
Thank you.
You know those two?
Who?
The fat, bald guy and his buddy.
The fat one is Thibault Mailloche,
robber and killer.
The other is Roger André.
Gauthier thinks he offed
a guard with a screwdriver.
Problem?
Don't know yet.
Anyway, I got it.
I figured a way out of here.
Through the fence, simple as that.
During yard time? That's suicide.
Got a better idea?
OK, Jacques.
When?
Before autumn, we're out or dead.
OK. Out or dead.
Let's get down to it.
What is it, Frenchman?
Get me some clippers from the shop.
What do I get out of it?
I got nothing to offer.
Just a piece of my hate for Gauthier.
If I make it, I'll come back and
spring you all. I give you my word.
You got guts, Frenchman.
I like that.
Bye.
How'd it go?
What's today?
You ask me every Monday.
Damn Frenchman. You want to die?
Won't be here, won't be a Monday.
They're still there.
Just hung over from the weekend.
Back to your cell!
Let's go, we got it.
- We're good.
- OK.
- Clear?
- OK.
We're good.
All clear.
- What are we supposed to do?
- I don't know.
- Clear?
- Keep going.
Shut up!
Come on!
Hit the dirt!
Hands on your heads.

<i>and barbed wire of the SCU,
under the guards' very noses.</i>
<i>SCU officials vow to turn hardened
criminals into model schoolboys.</i>
<i>Jacques Mesrine had sworn no prison</i>

<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>it was the gangster
who kept his word.</i>
Give me <i>2</i> minutes, jeez!
Glory, Jean-Paul.
Glory.
Get nabbed,
you won't come outwith your hands up.
They shoot on sight.
Got to be quick.
How much time?
30 seconds.
OK for you?
- Do I have a choice?
- No.
Everybody on your stomachs!
On your stomachs!
Lie down! Hurry up!
Against the wall!
Look at that wall.
Don't move, it'll be OK.
The wall! That's all that matters.
Face the wall!
Good.
Nobody moves. Relax.
Keep still.
OK! Ten...
nine...
eight...
Thank you.
Goodbye, everyone! Keep still.
No, the one across the street.
Jeez!
Time to go.
We won't be long.
I love you.
Let's go.
Crazy Frenchman.
Guys!
There!
Mesrine!
Christ!
Two, three!
Jeez!
- Try it?
- You go.
Mailloche!
Jean-Paul!
We got to go!
Let's go!
Grenade!
You all right?
Don't worry. Step on it!
Quick!
Help us. It got hairy!
Come on.
You all right?
Go.
PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE
You'll have two minutes.
Best I could do.
All right?
Attorney's office.
Yes, Jeanne, he's here.
Hello. My baby.
Oh, yes.
My love.
Are you OK?
Yes, yes.
Everything's fine here.
It's not fine.
Not at all. What are you saying?
I'm coming for you soon.
No, don't do anything. Please.
I will. Stop it, you know.
I'm with Mercier.
We're armed to the teeth.
Count on me.
You know you can.
I don't want you to.
My sentence is almost up.
Quiet. What are you saying?
My love, we'll leave together.
It'll all be fine. Trust me.
Listen to me.
Listen, I don't want you to.
You understand?
Don't come for me.
I'm coming.
Stop.
Jacques, they know you're coming.
They know.
They'll kill you.
No one kills me till I say so.
I'm coming.
I don't want you to.
Stop it! I'm telling you I'm coming.
I'm coming!
I said so, so I will.
No, Jacques.
Just be ready. That's all I ask.
Stay ready.
It's over, Jacques.
What do you mean?
It's over.
You and me, it's over.
And the left?
Not the same.
Still a little numb.
Hey, jeez!
Shit.
It'll be all right.
Hello.
Hi.
You do all that shooting?
It's hunting season, no?
No.
That's just it.
I told you.
Anyway, we were just practising.
Oh, yeah?
I've seen you before.
The escapees!
Enough, enough.
If they catch us now, we'll hang.
Yeah, right.
Out or dead.
Out or dead.
