I'm earth. Mother of Creation.
Seen from above I'm a planet.
A planet eclipsed.
The Creator's mistake is giving intelligence only to man.
Man is trying to occupy me by being over smart...
which is the height of foolishness.
Fully knowing the sky and I can never meet...
man is fixing the price, a high price for me...
and is making the common man afraid even to dream of...
building a house of his own.
Even if the God tells them himself that it is wrong...
As per your promise...
your brother's sons, Pandavas have...
requested you to give 5 villages
one to each of them.
Leave alone 5 villages...
I'll not give them even a needle point of land.
As you please. Let there be war.
Have you seen! They won't listen.
And hence the Kauravas perished.
But it didn't stop there. As Lord Krishna said in Gita,..
That every sinner has to reborn...
they are reborn.
In the past, as Hitler and Stalin...
now in the form of Bush and Saddam.
One for petrol, one for diamonds and...
precious metals, have been fighting to no end.
And it is me, who suffers.
Thousands get buried in me but they couldn't conquer me.
Even India, called the holy land, couldn't escape.
Pakistan has been claiming Kashmir belongs to them and...
kept fighting.
The air, the earth, the water don't belong to individuals.
Gandhiji preached this but did they listen? They killed him.
In Andhra Pradesh, it is too much.
Endless riots and gang wars.
It has become like mafia.
And the king of mafia is this Devraj.
Hundreds of gangs came up against him.
One of them is Pandu.
Their main weapons are force and forgery.
That is, producing fake documents.
The word they used...
for it is 'kabja' (land grabbing).
Land grabbing in Andhra.
Registration of 100 acres with forged documents.
Maruti Nagar lake, in the control of land grabbers.
Fraud in Nadargul.
Police inactivity.
Fraud in the name of freedom fighters.
Action of factionists in Rayalaseema.
Land grabbing.
Grabbing of graveyards.
Rowdism.
Gangs in the grip of politicians.
Atrocities on Jetering Road.
Gang wars on land grabbing on the rise.
Can you please show me the original documents?
Not now. I'll give them after registration and payment of...
balance amount.
I don't mean so. It is just to show my lawyer.
Here are the originals.
Okay, they are perfect.
Sign that you've sold this land to me and registration is done.
What about balance amount?
He took the original documents. He can't fight him.
He will kill.
I've to do it. Land value is a crore. Let's see.
Look, if you have to get 90 lakhs...
you have to pay 10 lakhs to brother.
Sign the documents that you sold the land to brother.
He will deal with Pandu.
Day before yesterday someone came...
to seek donation to build Saibaba temple. Who are they?
From Sai Seva Samiti. - Call them. We will donate.
Why are you shocked? Brother is philanthropist.
He does a good deed before he commits a murder.
What are you waiting for? Sign.
Speak, Lakshmanrao. - You purchased in Suvarna Estate.
Devraj has bought it long ago. How can you buy it?
Tell him not to be over smart because of political support.
I've it too.
Tell him not to interfere in this land issue.
That's what I say. No litigations between us.
Come to our office. Let's discuss. What say?
It is your need. You come to my office to talk.
Okay. Let us meet at the site.
You can bring all your men if you want but we are only three.
That is better. Let's meet.
Devraj, don't mess with us unnecessarily.
Bapinedu sold the land to me. I've the original documents.
Who is he to sell and who are you to buy?
I've bought it. I've the original documents. Have a look.
You bought in 95. Got cheated. I've bought it in 92.
Here are the originals.
Let me see.
Right. This is the original document.
Give Bapinedu the value of land at government rate of that time.
4 lakhs per acre for 5 acres is 20 lakhs.
Then he got it already. Pandu already gave him.
32, 33, 34, 35...
Continue... 36, 37, 38.
You seem to work more than him. - It is always like that.
But the credit goes to someone else.
Shravani... It's uncle. - How are you, brother?
I'm fine. ls brother-in-law there? - He is here.
It's my brother. Why did you call so early morning?
My daughter Laxmi, your would be daughter-in-law.
Her marriage with your son... - She will die.
Who? - Your daughter.
But my daughter doesn't. - That's why she will die.
Worthless proposal.
Is he dead? - Don't say inauspicious words.
We were talking about our son's marriage.
I won't marry so soon - Later on no one will marry you.
Please stop. - Listen to me, father.
I've to settle in job, make a name for myself, it takes time.
Get her married if you want.
Don't implicate me to save yourself.
I won't marry so soon.
We have to buy a groom for her.
So you sell me!
On the road.
Why not sell the plot in Sitaram Nagar?
Never. My only wish in life is...
to have a own house with flower beds in the front.
Live there with children and grandchildren.
I'll give away my entire salary. Don't force me to marry.
We need time to find a girl for you anyway.
You bribe me! Do government employees look like fools?
Bribe and get the work done! Are we worthless?
Do we look like corrupt?
No, sir. Do it free.
Give me fast. He is getting angry. Leave fast.
Do I look like a beggar?
Who will for free? No respect for government employees.
How much will you give? - Rs.5000.
Think you can give 5000 or 10000 and your work will be done?
Give me 10000. I'll do it. - I don't have that much.
Then get lost.
Sir, I'm in financial problem.
Take this. - You give me 5000 and...
get me caught on camera?
Give it at home. - Address? - You idiot! Ask the peon.
Go, I'll tell you. You useless fellow. Go.
No one has respect for us. Will he go to house or not?
Call madam. - I'm the Madam.
You look like a doll. - That is my misfortune.
Bold headed husband and a beautiful wife!
Why do I care? Sir told me to give you money.- Come in.-Sure.
Take it. - I don't see children. Went to school?-There're no kids.
No kids! Of course. He has no relief from taking bribes.
No use brooding over the past. Take it.
Sorry for touching your hand.
Never mind. You made me feel I'm a woman.
How did you happen to marry him?
My father went to him for land registration. He demanded money.
He couldn't pay, so he gave you?
How did you guess? - We are both sailing in the same boat.
You have no kids. I've no property.
Take it.-When'll you come again? - When I give another 5000.
Give that now. Come fast. - You are kind.
You are young and I'm kind.
I understood. Bye.
Dowry means 'katnam
I've not taken dowry. - Late marriage.
Lucky that you got me. - We better forget it.
Hey mister, smoking in public places is prohibited.
Then smoke but don't exhale the smoke.
Why are you late?
Went to Nirmala Industries for inspection.
Shall we lunch? - Wait... - Wait...
Let me see the response to matrimonial.
We can see while eating. I'm hungry.
They belong to zoo. Why are they here?
My son got all my habits. - Why did you stop?
That is what you do every Sunday with friends.
Write that your son has all your habits.
My father got me married to a drunkard. Ruined my life.
I take 2 spoons in a week. You are over doing it.
Look. This guy is handsome. Good job.
Smoking? - No.
Drinking? - No.
Khujadosham is must.
No Khujadosham. - It should be there.
'Dosham' means bad!
I've 'khujadosham so groom must have it too.
If not he will die.
Come here.. come here.
Look. - He is better than Abhishek.
No drinking and has khyadosham too.
Everything is fine. The girl is good looking. Bank job.
She has no parents. Raised by grandfather.
If everything goes well, we will look after her like parents.
You are being true wife. What do we do now? - Phone call.
Is Janaki there?
I need a months time. My grandpa is under treatment.
Boss is calling you.
Didn't you go to school? - Holidays. So helping father.
Where is your gang?
These're are sanctioned loan applications.
Enquire and give me report.
Come to Satya's house urgently. - What happened to him?
Nothing to him. But my personal loan is sanctioned.
I beg of you. Give me milk.
If not my father will kill me. Please give me milk.
Satti! - Father! - Hasn't you supplied milk yet?
Not a drop of milk? When will you milk and then supply?
It didn't give me milk.
Why will it give you milk if you don't feed it?
Get up. - Don't hit me. - I gave you 4 buffaloes an year ago.
What did I say then? - To multiply them.- Did you do it?
You go to bars and drink beer.
This is my last warning.
By next year you should buy 2 more buffaloes.
If not, I'll peel off your kin, you rascal.
Milk them and go sell, understand?
You rogue, you made father beat me up. Are you happy now?
Coming. When did you come? - Sometime back.
Never mind. Come to shop fast after selling the milk.
Look at me. How can I come. He beat me up badly.
My loan got sanctioned. If you help, I planned...
to take you to Mallika Sherawat show. We will go.
You should have told me earlier. I'm bored of milking buffaloes.
I'll come in the evening.
A bank officer will come for inspection.
Let me show I've an assistant. Act like you are working.
I'll show my acting skills for Mallika Sherwat's sake.
She has come.
Do something. - I don't know anything.
What do I do? - Vacate the seat. Go there.
When did you set up the shop? - An year ago.
You are not a tax payer. I want guarantee.
No problem. - Who is it? - It's him. Vijji, my friend.
He implicated me too besides you.
You knew he will do it! I curse both of you.
Where does he work? - Satyam Dairy Farm.
He implicated your buffaloes too.
Salary? - Rs.20,000. He is Marketing Manager.
So much salary for selling milk!
Why are you shocked?
Wonder how he became Marketing Manager at such young age?
He is very brilliant. Just passed Group I exam.
Going for interview soon. Will get selected definitely.
We will see him as police officer soon.
Then he will give surety as government employee.
Is he really your worker?
You donkey? Can't you know to plug in at least?

Even God knows you go to temple to watch girls.
Don't swear on god.
I swear on you. - Wife, your husband's life!
You want my husband dead?
I know you are suspecting me instigated by someone.
Do you want me show proof?
He resembles me so much. Who is he?
Your twin! Don't act.
If I see you smoke again, know what will I do?
Shoot me?
I'll smoke, make your mother smoke. Your sister smokes too.
Legal warning. Cigarette smoking is injurious to health.
It causes cancer. Causes death.
Understood now? Go and prepare for interview.
Who has sent you that photo? - I won't tell you, dear.
You said you will come tomorrow morning. Why did you come now?
I've brought money. - You said you can't give now?
My luck has changed for good after meeting you. - Really?
Yes. What about my work?
Don't push me about it.

So that I can meet 4 times. - Whom? - You.

Why are you smiling? Get lost, go.
Everyone wants to bribe. Do I look corrupt?
Will he give? He will.
No entry without girls. What do we do? - Hire them as usual.
You made me a broker too!
Looks like original.
How does your father sign? In Telugu or English?
In Urdu. - Sign it. - Me! - We don't know Urdu.
You are implicating me in your scam...
using Mallika Sherawat's name.
Go and do your work. It is time for that girl to come.
I stopped smoking. - Why suddenly?
If I smoke my father will get cancer.
How? - Like, we switch on here and the light come on there.

Kill him tomorrow if not pub party tickets will go waste.
I'll speak to Mastan. You come directly to pub with girls.
I've to do it too? - Yes.
Uncle, I'll call later. Driver, wait.
Hello, Mastan! Send three good looking girls to Celebrity club.
Girls! Pub! - Sexy girls.
Where is Satti? - I don't know. - Stop.
You come with me.
I sponsored it! What about me?
You implicated me in loan sanction. Pay for it.
You are not destined to see Mallika Sherawat.
Go. As if she is waiting only for you.
'O bachelor, come, the girl is alone.
'O magician, take me as a gift.
'Take me away, O magician.
'There is nothing to stop me.
'Today is holiday for me.
'Working day for youth.

Give it to me.
I'm here...- Informer called me. - Came for a raid?
Yesterday cigarette. - I quit smoking.
Today drinks. - I'll quit from tomorrow.
Then girls. - Girls! - I know you brought them.
Who is that informer, father? - Why?
To strangle. - What you did is wrong. Then this great idea.
I thought you will become a police officer and make me proud.
You refuse to marry to do these things? - This is for fun.
Otherwise I'm serious about career.Let me tell you something.
The way you respect mother, bringing up kids, made me...
realise what is an ideal family.
I asked for time to make money before marriage.
Don't I know that, my son?
He is the ideal groom for me.
You can't keep a dying man alive.
Send me home fast. I can't stay here.
It takes another 10 days to recover fully.
Till then be a good patient.
What's the news about the boy?
I suspected him unnecessarily. He is okay.
But he doesn't want to marry till 2 years.
Do you think I'll be alive till then?
Nothing will happen to my grandpa.
Greetings, sir! - How are you? - I'm fine.
Next week is temple celebrations.
As a trustee of the temple you... - What'll the celebrations cost?
Around 50,000/- if it is grand.
My troubles are increasing these days.
Nari, see what all they want. Bye. - Bye.
Mallesh, will God save me if I do good deeds? - Definitely.
Take him.
God exists. He saved me.
He saved me.
He saved me. God exists.
All the best. - Best of luck.
Aide of AP MLA Devraj, Nalla Mallesh...
is killed brutally in Venkateswara temple yesterday.
Devraj's men are creating havoc in the name of 'bandh'.
Don't you know Mallesh is dead?
Everyone closed their shops. Why are you open?
I'll lose 2000 if I close. Will you give that? Get lost.
Don't you know who is Mallesh? - I know. Is he a great man?
What did you say! Break down the shop.
Don't you know Anna's power? Burn down his shop.
She covers wherever the fights take place. She is beautiful!
Auto, take me to Nampalli. - Don't you know it is bandh?
Rioting is going on.
I've to go to Nampalli. - I won't come.
I've to go to interview. Keep it for damages.
Go fast. - Sit.
Flag for a rowdy!
I wish it is longer. I can use it as lungi.
Never mind. I can use it to wipe my vehicle.
Hey, you are wiping vehicle with the flag?
Do you think it's a national flag?
By the way, is he a leader of the country? - No.
State leader? - No. City leader? - No.
Then why a flag for a nobody?
He is the leader of rowdies. Killed 15 people.
That's why the rogue got killed.
He doesn't even have a blade to shave. Look at his beard.
Hey, I'll kill you. - Kill me. - What! - Kill me I say.
Useless fellow. He must've been killed for murders he committed.
Have you hoisted a flag when Bhagat Singh died? - No.
When Nehruji died? - No.
When Gandhiji died? - No.
You can't because you aren't born then.
You have huge body. I wish you have a brain too.
You think no one is questioning your actions today.
I'm asking you what's this. Tomorrow someone will join me.
Gradually numbers increase to crores.
Do you know what happens then? - What happens?
This flag.. - This flag... - Will be hoisted for you.
He fried my brains.
You rascal, don't you know it is strike?-He is going to interview.
Interview, my foot! - I've to go to interview. Let me go.
Entire market is closed. You are going for interview?
I'm getting late. Let me go. - Want to go? Go ahead.
Want to go to interview? Go.
Catch him.
Who are you?
Come on, hit me. - Stop.
Didn't you remember interview when fighting on the road?
Think you are a big rowdy?
I did what police couldn't do.
I hit them to prove my capacity before I joined police force.
Prove yourself, my foot.
You will be suspended if you break the law.
3rd degree treatment is right for them. Do it after I leave.
You took so long. Give him the papers and let us leave.
Did you think police will take you to your in-law's place?
Don't you know to run away, you fools?
Here are the bail papers. - You may go.
I'm going. Time to attend court. - Lakshman, wait.
Next Sunday is my brother's marriage.
My life is passing by in attending weddings.
I wonder when I print cards, invite you all for my wedding.
But you said it is fixed. - It happens initially.
Then? - Get cancelled.
I wonder what relatives and neighbours are thinking.
What else? They think there is some flaw in the horoscope.
That's okay. What if they think I lack something?
Why will they think so? - Why not?
What do you need to drive scooter? License, isn't it?
To be get children? - A wife.
For that I've to get married. If not they think I'm impotent.
What do you mean? - Think I've no license.
If you agree, I know an alliance in my village.
Do it. I'll tell Devraj to get you promoted as AC.
Thanks, bye.
See that they shiver at the mention of Devraj's name. Bye.
Want to go to interview? - No.
To fight against atrocities, one needs guts not just uniform.
I've it. - Really?
Let him go.
I'll show. Is that the way to talk to police?
Let him go, inspector Satya.
We have record to show who are goons.
Media will expose you. - Media people are too much.
That's why you are under control.
Will you leave them or want telecast if it?
Go.
Thanks. - No need for formality.
Crime reporter Sindhu. You took risk to release us, why?
We witness crime every day. But not those who fight back.
I'm glad to see it.
I helped you to befriend you.
Let's meet later, Sindhu.
Just a minute. - What's it? - Hope you know me.
People like you are more popular than good people.
I'll give you whatever you want but don't leave Devraj.
After his death you will be the don.
Someone else will hire me to kill you. Should I kill you?
What I mean is... - We are not hired goons.
Think, I'll meet you again.
I won't leave you unless you agree. Let's go.
Here they come. - Greetings to my would be father-in-law.
Come in.
Lakshman Rao, you want marriage? We will do it.
I've to tell you something urgently. - What's it?
The groom looks a bit old but looks sturdy.
Do you know why he isn't married till now? - Why?
He has no license. - He can get one.
It has to be natural. Can't buy it.
What's that? - Fertility.
Can I talk to the girl in private?
Oh, he is not so young but he is romantic.
Don't say he isn't young. He may not look young...
but he is young at heart.
Daughter, go inside.
Lakshman Rao, come out.
I'm out.
Get out.
What did you say in the police station? Not to mess with you?
This is called shaking up.
People will talk about you from today that you are impotent.
Lakshman Rao has no license.
This is very nice.
Just like machine stitching.
My father was handicapped too like them.
After his death I set up Ashram and see him in them.
Looks like he is father for me. - Getting carried away it seems.
Only for two! - He is sentimental.
Will he die if I refuse? - Without doubt.
But I doubt. Shall we test his love?
It's my new scooty. Bought just yesterday.
Good. - But I can't drive.
I can. - Don't you know? - Very well.
Teach me.
This is back brake. - I see!
Press this, the vehicle stops.
Accelerator should be raised slowly, slowly.
Not like that. Slowly.
Get on the vehicle.
She could have called me. - Why? - To teach to drive.
Why are you pushing it? Can I help you? - Puncture, you rogue.
Even black belt holder can't kick so hard.
He is feeling jealous.
Look them getting close!
He is burning. I think we are over doing it.
It's okay. I like it.
Don't put sudden brake. Go straight.
I never felt so bad. - Look at this girl.
You were after us till you got loan. Now we chase you?
I'm sad that my shop got burnt.
You make me cry?
I warned you about him. He burnt TV when I came.
Later the shop.
Anyway, why do I care? If you don't pay up...
we will catch hold of your guarantor and collect it.
Crime committed by one but someone else gets punished!
Like I get heart attack but he gets operated?
You look very busy. Can't you see. -I'm teaching her to drive.
Why are you here? Owner has not come.
There is only ash is left. - Right.
That is what remains after fire. - Who will repay loan?
Me? - Yes. - Punishment for signing! - Yes.
What if I don't' pay? - I'll make you pay.
How? - I'll go to your work place, Satyam Dairy Farm.
How dare you sell my dairy form, you rascal.
Don't hesitate. Go ahead. You move the vehicle.
What arrogance! I'll teach you.
Step in with your right foot, darling.
Who is she? - My wife. - What about wife at home?
She is my wife too. - Don't tell me. - Mother...
Your brother... - No. First wife's son.
What is it? - See what has father brought.- Come in, sister.
She is your pinni. (mother's sister)
Since when? - Today. Our eyes met.
Then our hearts. - I don't accept it.
I bless you happy, long married life.
I don't accept at all. - You are talking?
You roam with a new girl daily. What's wrong if I do?
Me and roaming with girls? - Look here.
So, you do it because of this photo?
If son is 420, father should be 840, right?
She is Ravi's girl friend.- Then why is she roaming with you?
That is a drama. - What a twist?
True. What happened is...
He is burning. We are over doing, I think.
Jealousy is part of love. I like it.
He is gone on me. You suspected him unnecessarily.
For this I wasted money on junior artist.
Junior artist! - I came to become a heroine.
But became a junior artist. - Okay, go... go.
Bye. You may go.
Who is after me? Who is spying on me? Have you hired CBI?
I told you that I won't disclose.
I don't want your uncle's habits for you.
Why are you so gloomy all the time?
Some things are painful. Don't go away by sharing.
Okay, don't tell me if it is so. - Then how do I feel light?
Then tell me. Is she the right girl for him?
Is she right for you?
I don't mean so. - I understood it.
What? - That you love her. But he is after her.
He can't do anything. I love him.
Who is clicking my photos?
Where are you looking? - Try to understand my situation.
Then how can we find out his feelings?
Forget it. I'm harming myself.
Want to teach him a lesson? - Of course.
Then don't repay loan. - It's a good thing. - I'll kill you.
Let's play a drama.
Satti, come here.
Where were you? - Just roaming here and there.
Come. - No. She called me. I'm with you. - No. - Come.
I know everything. - About what?
That you are not employed and Satti isn't a worker.
That you have 4 buffaloes and call it Dairy Farm.
Supporting a crime is a bigger crime, you know?
Do you know what is the jail term or the fine for it?
Don't ask me, you tell me.
I'll get heart attack.
Even my father never give me this much tension.
Stop it. 5 years jail term and one lakh fine.
Don't scare us. You gave loan, he took it.
What've we done? -If you want to be behind bars, I can't help it.
Please, don't trouble them because of me.
I give 24 hours. Know what to do? - I know.
If she goes to my father, I'll die of heart attack,
Don't you believe? Look what I'm carrying with me. - What is this!
I know you will take me lightly. Look.
I'll arrange money in 2 days. You go and manage with her.
What should I do? You won't. I'll drink it. I'll die.
Okay. - So you will manage? - I'll. Thank you.
What a plan! Great.
Gas. - You charge service charges, so keep it inside.
Here is the bill. - Why did you charge 306?
It was only 267 last month.
Hiked by 40 rupees? - From this month.
If they hike, you collect it?
Yes. Give me money. I'll go. - I'll pay old rate.
- I'll take it back. I'll brake your head.
You talk too much because I'm keeping quiet?
It's not you but we are quiet.
Who will pay if you keep increasing the cost?
Why do you hit me? - I should kill you.
As it is rates of food is increased.
People are eating once a day. Hike gas rate and rob that too!
Why do you hit me! It is hiked by government.
I'm hitting you to teach the government. - How?
If I hit you, you go and complain to your owner.
He will go and complain to CM. Then changes take place in system.
Sir, spare me. I'm only doing my duty.
Pay me at the old rate. - Will you add the rest?
If not, you will kill me.
That's better. Take the money.
Is that the way to drink? - ls it soup or milk? - Never mind.
Hey, come and teach me to drive.
Me! - Won't you teach me? - I can't.
Coming or not! - Coming. Let's go.
First press it. - You show me.
That's accelerator. Raise it. - I don't know, you do it.
Woe is me. - You are talking too much.
They look good together.
You only talk of them or will you tell her of your feelings?
I'm scared. - Shall I try?
Why are you not driving? - Get lost.
Why did you leave in the middle?
I won't teach her drive.
You will never change.
You are acting pricey.
'They compare me to Jennifer.
'Say better than Marlyn Monroe.
'They butter me up.
'Call me their dream girl.
'All these boys try to impress me.
'Follow me everywhere.
'Why do you act pricey?
That isn't good for you.
'Won't you teach her driving bike?
'Won't pay the bill?
'Do you know the consequences?
'You won't get a better chance.
'Don't leave the opportunity.
'Have fun.
'Get lost.
'Change his mind.
'We have to change it.
'She isn't a girl. - What did she say?
'You don't understand easily.
'You need guidance.
What is the discussion? Are you coming or not?
Look at the way she speaks.
That's the way girls talk when they like you.
'Coffee cafes and restaurants are for us to meet.
'To help us meet.
'She is gone crazy. She is like Dracula. Killing me.
'I can never get angry with you.
'Because I like you a lot.
'Tell this to a deaf. Bye. - I'll tell her.
'Don't hurt her feelings. Don't go away.
'Stop nagging me. Who are you to tell me?
'Why're you back again? - She isn't a girl but an atom bomb.
Hey, girl! He won't come. May I come?
Hey, shorty, you are hardly three foot. If I hit you...
you will become shorter.
She doesn't like me. You go.
Tell me what to do?
'Cool me off with a cool drink.
'Share it with me using straws.
'I'll give money. Go get it yourself and drink it all.
'He is foregoing offer of a beautiful girl.
'Leave it to me.
'That is what is boyfriend. - Don't link with girl.
'Bye to you all and good bye to her.
Why did you stop the vehicle? - Because of speed breaker.
She looks better outside than on TV.
That's why she kept a bodyguard.
Not bodyguard, but an useless fellow.
We burnt down his shop. He has no work. So roaming with girl.
Let's teach him a lesson today.
This is Sitaram Nagar. 50 kms away from Hi-Tech city.
Total 500 acres. Who is the owner?
Pingali Venkat Ramiah, Freedom fighter.
Don't know if he is alive now.
25 years ago, he divided it into plots, distributed to poor.
Gandhian.
Husband, I'm going to temple.
Gandhian? So our work will be done without violence.
Many are planning to construct houses.
Some constructed compound walls.
We need goons, bulldozers. May have to kill too.
How can it be done without violence?
Suma... - Yes. Donate food to beggars.
And in the Hundi, 1116 rupees...
Land value is big.
Drop 5000.
So, decided to grab all 500 acres?
Earlier the saying is land belongs to who cultivates it.
Now, land belong to who has the power.
There is not much of difference between the vulture and Devraj.
It eats insects and worms on the ground when hungry.
This fellow swallows the land itself.
Devraj's eyes fell on Sitaram Nagar.
Any news about Pingali Venkatramiah?
He must be dead. - Okay
Wait a minute.
Greetings, sir!
We couldn't find out. Pingali Venkat Ramiah in dead or alive?
Don't worry about it. I'll prepare duplicates.
They have to procured stamp paper of 1978.
In this country money can produce fake documents.
So, here is the impostor Venkatramiah.
On the documents he supposed to have sold to Devraj...
he is pulling his thumb impression.
He doesn't know that this act will lead to...
unforgettable event in some peoples lives.
As long as such officers exist, Gandhiji's dreams...
will remain unfruitful.
MRO, who joined hands with Devraj has been...
mugging with records, all the time.
I'll give you 50 crores and see you face no risk.
You just give an announcement. - What announcement?
Airport will come up in surrounding area of Sitaramnagar.
Statement in papers.
One idea can change ones life.
One announcement to a cell phone company...
is going to bring thousands of people to roads.
This is tomorrow's news.
We will get twenty lakhs if we sell the plot now.
I'll get you married grandly with the boy you like.
And I'll give you as much as you want for your own studio.
Here is the remaining 15 lakhs.
Rate has gone up. Now it costs 30 lakhs.
How can it double suddenly? - Have you not seen the paper?
Airport is going to come up. So the price has gone up overnight.
Buy it if you want or leave it. Here is your advance.
Land disputes come under civil court. Police can do nothing.
Civil case? Murder took place in front of my eyes.
Put that in writing.
Sir, my daughter's wedding will be cancelled.
Give me a lakh at least.
Sir, I'll touch your feet.
Throw him out.
Father, what's this!
People like us can't even dream.
My dreams are shattered.
You are unlucky. Why are you crying?
I should cry for giving birth to you.
Calm down, father. I wanted to sell the land for your marriage.
Now that land is gone.
Now, I can't get you married. You elope with someone.
Or you go and die. Go, die.
What is this, father? What has she done?
Why do you shout at her for someone's actions?
Open the door.
Daughter, open the door.
Open the door.
I've killed you, dear.
What happened to you, father? Father... father...
Please talk to me.
We must not leave them.
In the next week crime file, we will expose Devraj.
What's the use? Do we get back our land?
So, do we keep quiet? - Listen to my idea.
I met a Naxalite a month ago to interview.
He became my good friend. We will take his help.
He kills such people. Our involvement won't be there.
Listen. Sinners die dog's death.
He will pay for it. So leave it. - You are not saying anything.
Devraj isn't individual but king of an organisation of...
land grabbers. Undisputed don.
It isn't just the problem of you and me.
But of all those, who lost their lands.
To defeat their organisation, we have to unite and fight.
So, you want to bring awareness in people?
Have you gone crazy?
To do that, you are not Gandhiji, he isn't Netaji.
Nor I'm Chandra Sekhar Azad.
Trying isn't a crime.
This is the place. Earlier we were only two.They bashed us up.
Now there is no question of leaving them. - Let's go.
We can't do anything to Devraj.
Can't even support, who can do it.
We got used to compromising.
We can live somehow, but not these people.
I've to arrange for a place for them.
We will raise donation. - From whom?
Ask me. I'll give you as much as you want.
Get you back your land.Construct a building for these children.
But you have to sleep with me for one night.
Okay, I agree.
Shocked? I'm telling the truth.
Give me your phone number. Give.
You will phone me, right?
Let's go.
Aren't you ashamed to sleep with him? - Who are you to ask me!
I love you. - So, you hit me?
I should be with you because you love me?
What about them? You can't fight with them.
He is better. Has guts to ask me directly to sleep with him.
Fight with Devraj and win! Do you think it is possible!
Our unity is our strength.
Only then we will get our land. - Get lost.
You are not in senses. Think of your reputation.
Don't talk about reputation. You have no right to do so.
Your sister committed suicide as her marriage got cancelled.
Because of that your father has become mad.
And you think of reputation now? And you teach me?
Except the temple, land around it is grabbed.
God isn't able to do anything. What can we do?
What about you?
I get just one Sunday to spend with family.
Where is the time for social work. Forgive me. Bye.
They burned down your shop.
They wanted to put up a dairy farm.
You wanted to set up a studio.
All our dreams are shattered with one stroke.
Yet you are not angry. I'm ashamed to be your friend.
Devraj recently killed my husband for opposing him.
Where were you then? What unity you are talking about now?
No more words. Let's hit him back.
For all of us. - We won't keep quiet now.
Public didn't come. - Then what are you thinking?
We have decided to finish Devraj.
Yes. Let's take help of my Naxalite friend Surya.
No hesitation. We must kill him.
I'll take just 5 minutes.
Then I won't disturb you.
Devraj upset your lives earlier.
Now, hit your livelihood.
Don't know how many he will ruin tomorrow.
Small amounts like this are not enough.
You have the guts to use this.
What are you thinking?
Give me your phone number.
Let's go.
Let us observe Devraj movements. Decide on perfect place to kill.
Isn't it the principal of Shivani public school?
Devraj is coming as guest. - What time? - 9 am.
That is the best spot.
They have started.
They are close. Get ready.
Get going-
Murder attempt on ruling party MLA, Devraj.
Devraj was on the way to a school function. He escaped.
But his aides are seriously injured.
Murder attempt on Devraj gives way to many suspicions.
Police are enquiring from many angles.
Enquiring if it is some old enmity or any gang's involvement
Or Naxalites action.
Police and bomb squad experts are looking for clues.
They will be here in 10 minutes.
Why do you take so much tension? We are all in it. Be brave.
Don't be a fool. Police dogs can find us.
Why did you do it? You pressed the remote on time!
I misjudged the speed. Fraction of a second makes difference.
This is a job for experts, not for us.
We will definitely catch the culprits in 24 hours.
They operated with remote.
So they must be within the radios of 2 kms.
We will be caught. I'll run away to my village.
If I'm caught, I'll say I've no connection with you.
You do the same.
We will be caught surely. Minimum punishment is 10 years.
Our future is finished. - It's you, who fell for that girl.
You implicated all of us. - Stop it. Take no tension.
Nothing will happen to us. I took precaution.
Any suspicious characters found? - No. We found a cell.
Find whose cell phone is this and calls to and fro, quick.
I dropped the cell phone there. - You!
To make them suspect Pandu. - What!
I bought a SIM card in Vinayak's name.
I took Pandu's telephone number from this purse.
So that no one suspects us. He thought he will...
use us to kill Devraj.
Then take his place. Now Devraj will kill him.
Society will be cleansed of half the dirt.
Devraj, tell me.-This is Pandu's job. Cell phone belongs to him.
10 minutes before the bomb went of, he was informed.
We would have killed him there itself.
I want no part in it. I'll do my milk business.
I won't get involved again with you people.
2 months of love affair costs life sentence!
I don't want love, nor this nuisance.
I realise why Gandhi is called Mahatma.
I wonder how he united crores of people.
Out of thousand plot owners not even 4 have unity.
Anyway, we have no tension now. Let's have tea.
Tell me, Sindhu. - Did you get the news?
I got it. I'll call you later.
Brother, some one left this for you. - Give me.
Devraj escaped. But don't quit your fight.
You will definitely win next time. Keep trying.
If you quit, I'll send these photographs to Devraj.
He will kill you.
I've seen boys with guts after a long time.
I'm confident that the society will benefit by you.
We implicated Pandu. He took photos of us and implicated us?
It's definitely Pandu's job. - Do we have to kill Devraj?
We will die. - This time we can't even go near him.
Security will be so tight.
We have to clear photo issue. - We have to meet Pandu.
Police suspect land mafia's hand behind attack on Devraj.
Devraj escaped by a fraction of a second.
I want information on Pandu's whereabouts in 24 hours.
Till then none of you show me your faces.
Go catch him. - Be careful.
I've to go to court. I'll meet you in the evening.
Hey, I told you not to expose your cleavage.
There are no men here. - I'm there.
Never mind if you see. You have no license.
Lakshman Rao has no license.
He isn't taking the call. Let's send SMS.
It's Pandu!
I've to meet you urgently. - Sure. - Shall I come now?
Not now. Will meet tomorrow.
Where? - Call me tomorrow. I'll give you address.
Eat one more idli. - I can't, daddy.
Note down Pandu's address.
Tell me.
Who are you with bandages, blocking my way?
I'm dying daily for voting for you.
He is a mental Narayan. irritates others like hell.
Never mind. Let's move. - Where are you going?
What's this? Came out from hospital to die?
I've also brought the bill. Pay it.
Why should I pay?
I fell in the ditch because you have not laid roads.
Road ditch! What nonsense are you talking?
I'm from Anandnagar colony, who voted for you.
You promised roads when you begged for votes.
Did you do it. No!
You promised street lights. Did you do it?
No. You promised many more things. Did you fulfill?
Did you even enquire about the condition of gutters?
Or whether anyone fell in them?
I trusted your promise. But I fell in a ditch.
I went to doctor. He gave me the bill, I gave it to you.
I should pay? Never, you rogue.
Won't pay? I'll see how you don't pay.
Hello, Enadu newspaper? - Yes, tell me.
Write down what I say.
MLA... - Please wait.
Anna, press will come and create a scene.
Listen to me. Pay him. - Pay him!
I'll pay. Tell me how much is it.
I showed the bill. It's 1500. - Keep it all. Please go.
You go.
Mental. - Not mental, road is full of potholes.
If you don't clean up the gutters, people'll push you in it.
Why have the boy not come yet?
Madam, give me some food.
We missed him.
You know why we missed him because I've not done...
good deed before coming to kill you.
He is very hungry it seems. Tell him to eat.
Take it.
Pandu is dead.
We got rid of him. Got rid of photos. No tension.
He told us to kill but he got killed.
Devraj killed him.
Brother... - What's it?
I told you not to go back.
Don't let me warn you again.
If not, the photos will go to Devraj directly.
Is Pandu's soul sending photos.
Shut up. - The same person gave it.
When? - Just now. Did you notice the van number? - No.
He came by auto.
Okay, go.
So, Pandu has nothing to do with photos.
Then who? - Someone is observing us closely.
Why do you look at me!
Maybe your Naxalite friend... - Why should he do it?
We are saved fortunately. May not be the same next time.
We can't touch even his shadow.
If we don't act, photos might go to Devraj.
How about court case? - That can stop Devraj.
You are right. This is fighting too.
If not we will be in trouble.
Losing confidence is equal to defeat.
To make him feel insecure we must file a case.
We can stop him from using political power.
Some relief till we lose the case, and photos etc..
Pankajam. - Tell me, Lingam. - How long do we meet like this?
If marriage is like fevicol, divorce is like dettol.
I'm waiting how to get rid of him.
Shall we finish him? - No. We will run away.
I've nothing except clothes I'm wearing. Some are torn.
But he has. - The used ones? - Let's go.
Pankajam.. - I'm here.
Near the table.
Pick me up. - Love letter? Strange!
I've tolerated you this long. But I made a decision.
I'm running away with someone. As reward for my troubles...
besides the jewels in the safe...
we are taking the lakh of bribe money hidden under the cot.
Don't search for me. You have eyesight already.
Plus asthma and arthritis.
I wish from now on you will pay attention to house and wife.
Is this the luck you were talking about!
You rogue.
I'm at the bank. I'm coming. Call you later.
Driving lessons got over. What's it now?
Now, I've to teach you something. You have to learn. - What's it?
Tell me what is in my heart. I'll leave you.
Tell me.
I'll give you a tune. You must sing in that tune.
Okay, I'll try.
'Love is X-ray of heart.
'Love is romance.
'Love is as powerful as a thunder.
'Love is 8th wonder.
Good.
'Love is lazer.
'Love is lottery.
'Love is a teacher, a venture.
'Life is useless without love.
'Titanic is the definition for love.
'It got lost it in the ocean.
'Mumtaz Mahal is symbol of love.
'But the love is buried in a grave.
'Valentine is story of love.
'But the date keeps changing from February to March.
'Devdas showed what is love.
'But he spent all his time in bar.
'Laila, Majnu are example for love.
'But they remained as a fairy tale.
'Where there is no love, no life.
'It's only in Abdul Kalam's poetry, understood?
You are only 5 out of 1000 plot owners.
All of them have to come together.
No one wants to come. They are terrorised by Devraj.
Devraj grabbed our lands is a open secret.
Is there no way we can get them back?
There is only one way. If we can find the donor...
Pingali Venkataramiah. We can do something.
Everyone thinks he is dead.
We will file case anyway. But after 2 months.
Okay. Greetings, sir!
You are in between earth and the sky. You will die. Get down.
Why are you hitting me? I'll cut when you don't pay the bill.
Bill and pay? Who will pay if they hike the rates? Your father?
Minister, MLAs refuse to pay bills worth thousands.
You can't do anything to them but cut our lines?
We have no partiality. - What?
What's happening? You have to pay bill, that's all?
How much? - Rs.300.
Take it. - I've not seen such mad case.
Of course, you do. - Uncle, you have to control temper.
Trying to stop the sun with palm, controlling my temper are wrong.
Messiah of the people, Anna, a ray of hope.
Do you think the lawyer is uttering names of movies?
No. These are titles given by people, appreciating him.
They wrote so on the banners.
To prove that the land belongs to my client Devraj...
I request court permission to present MRO as witness.
What's your name? - Divadhinam. - Tell the judges the details.
Okay. In 1980, this land is sold by Pingali Venkatramiah...
to Mr.Dharmaraji, father of Devraj as per records.
I see! Submit the concerned records to the court.
Okay, sir. - You may go. - Okay.
Do you have anything to say?
To prove that this land belongs to Sitaram Nagar residents...
I beg the court to give me time to provide records.
In the meanwhile, police is ordered to send them to...
forensic lab for verification.
How did they have the guts to file a case against me.
He is next to you.
He is the man, who hit our men, filed the case.
When sugar in the body raises, it needs insulin.
When people forget fear, one like him should be murdered.
Why? To lose the case?
Keep aside such foolish ideas for now. Let's win the case first.
Where is the driver?
I'm asking where is the car? Why do you put your head down?
I can't tell you. - Why not? Tell me.
Police stopped the car at signal and asked for license.
You should have told it belongs to Lakshman Rao.
I did. He said my master has no license, nor me.
You can carry it, right? - But I don't have one.
I forget license at home. - I went home to take license...
then went to SI to show the license...
Is it necessary to use that word so many times? - I don't...
want to offend you.
You really don't mean that way, of course.
Of course. - Even if there is something...
people's criticism will affect it.
You argued in the court that we have no license on the land.
So the God made you a man without license.
Raju... - Coming, father.
Is it to kill Devraj? - No. To kill me.
She sent birthday greetings for him.
She is giving tension all the time. - What tension?
I'll tell this to your father, Pochayya. He will kill you.
Please don't. He beats me to pulp.
Where were you yesterday? Your cell was off too.
I brought birthday cake. It has gone waste.
You are becoming too much. Are we girlfriend boyfriend?
Even though you are angry, you said the right thing.
What do you think of yourself? - How dare you threaten me?
Want to do anything? Do it.
Mess with me, I'll kill you. - Kill me!
That's the sign of too much love.
I love you! I get irritated at the sight of you.
Good news. We are going to win.
Pingali Venkataramiah is alive.
Really! - Yes. I got the details from records on Freedom Fighters.
His photo too.
Where is he? - At present in Hyderabad.
But don't know the address. - I know. - Shut up.
Six months ago he was in Guntur.
How do you know?
The donor is my grandpa.
Don't brag. This isn't the time to tease.
Let me see. - You said you get irritated at the sight of me.
I'll go. - Please stop.
We have work with your grandpa. - Not with me?
If he says so then... - Come and tell her.
Why not stay longer? - I've to go.
My grandpa must be waiting. - I'll drop you.
No. So that you can meet my grandpa? I won't let it happen.
Can't I find out if you don't show me?
But no one other than me know where he is.
Don't say so. Tell me what do I do.
Say, 'I love you' to me. - I won't. - Then, I won't.
Please, tell me.
Did you call me? - No, but... I love you.
Is that the way to say it! Do I look like a beggar?
Say it with feeling.
I love you. - You took so much time to say it!
Let's go home. - Why do you rush?
There is a lot to say. - What's that?
We should romance. Come to an understanding.
Give me a kiss. - Kiss!
'Listen. Are you mad?
'Look at me. Know what I'm.
'Kissing me isn't a sin. Romancing isn't a sin.
'What a boy! Seduction makes him angry.
'Eyes are useless if you can't look at beautiful girl.
'You have no emotions? Don't you have desires?
'O God, only have you written me in my fate?
'Why are you arrogant? Why don't you leave me?
'Look at my eyes.
'Kiss me.
'I'm all yours. You have the right on me.
'My eyes are on you.
'Don't try do seduce me with your charm.
'I won't get caught in your charm.
'O my lover boy, give me a kiss.
'Stop chasing me and get lost.
'I won't be seduced by you.
'I'm no more in your grip.
'I know you are kidding me.
'Don't play with me. Don't come after me.
'Sip the nectar or from my lips.
'Get drowned in my love.
'Girls are match sticks. Don't ignite fire of love in me.
'I gave myself to you and you run away from me?
I'll go to hospital and be back in 2 hours. - Why?
My grandpa is getting discharge. I told the old man already.
Someone is following me. I'm in Panjagutta circle. I'm scared.
Come to help.
Do one thing. - What's it?
Go under flyover. - So?
It will collapse and you die. That's the end. Keep the phone.
Why did he follow you?
Grandpa is getting discharge. I withdraw money from the bank.
He is following me since then. - Okay, let's go. We are late.
Hi grandpa. - Come in, dear.
This is Vijji. This is my grandfather...
the godfather you are searching. - Greetings.
Come here, dear. She lost her parents in childhood.
I raised her. Gave her full freedom.
Enough. He came on some important work. Listen to him.
I'll meet the doctor. - Okay.
Air, water and earth don't belong to one individual.
I wanted to follow Gandhiji's principles.
Distributed my land to poor.
How are you people keeping quiet when it is being robbed?
For people to unite these days we need many Gandhijis.
Don't worry. One believes in truth never fails.
I'll come to court. Give evidence.
See that you people get back your lands.
I'll leave. Come to grounds on 15th August.
That might bring unity in people.
Positively. - Bye.
Thank you. You have done a great favour to all of us.
You will be benefited if you are with me.
But it took long time to realise it.
Try to understand me at least now.
Shall we meet in a restaurant today evening?
Why? By any chance you are in love with me?
What are you saying?
Today evening at 5 pm we will meet.
Where are you? Caught in the traffic jam.
Where are you? - Traffic jam. How long do I wait?
I can't help it. - Come fast. - Okay.
Where are you, rogue?
Who are you? - Your husband's second wife.
Listen to me. - Come home. I'll teach you.
This girl in the hotel...
You took the girl to hotel. You rogue, rascal. - Listen...
I was chasing you and you were acted pricey. It's your turn now.
Greetings! - Greetings!
The donor of this land, freedom fighter, follower of Gandhiji...
Shri Pingali Venkataramiah.
Why didn't you come yesterday?
I came. - You had come! I did see you.
He is dead. Call doctor. - Grandpa...
He is no more.
He came to change our fate.
But God isn't in favour of it.
Have you brought supporting documents?
This is the certified signatures by Forensic lab of...
Pingali Venkataramiha.
They are the proof that he donated the land to poor in 1980.
But my client has proof that it is sold to my client's father
before 2 years to that.
I beg, please verify and give your judgment.
On perusal the proof shows that...
Pingali Venkataramiah has sold the land to Dharmaraj.
So, the land belongs to Devraj as per law.
You are leaving with head down. No guts to walk with head up?
O God, what anger! Kill me with your looks?
Oh, I'm scared. Tell him not to look like that.
What is there to talk to him! Shall I kill him?
Haven't you seen in Hindi movies?
Hero isn't attacked directly.
He will finish us. - You mean he is a hero?
He think so, isn't it? No?
If not he should have reacted.
When will you understand that I reached this position...
after how many murders and other crimes?
You should think? But you don't because there is the court.
You think filing case is enough. But it needs proof, you know.
Where is it? The old man is dead.
No. I killed him.
Shocked? You thought you are free from my clutches.
But I killed him on that day.
That too, in your colony, amidst all of you.
Now do what you can.
I'm going to office.
Hi, baby. Playing with my cell?
Why are you here? - Did you bring photos again?
No. He was looking for you in the hotel. I brought him here.
Venkataramiah's death isn't natural. Someone murdered him.
This one proof is enough to implicate Devraj.
Not enough.
Next time the shock will leave him thinking why he is alive.
We have never seen him with Devraj. You have to find him.
Why did you kill Pingali Venkataramiah? Who is behind it?
You thought temple is a safe place than office?
I've bought it to put in Hundi. Go, consider your work is done.
You are finished too. Who is it?
Your name is Divadheenam but look at what you do.
In older days, Dharmaraj gambled. This is the same case.
Anyway why are you here? Your matter was settled in the court.
Actual case begins now. - How? - Camera.
I touch your feet. - This is my hand. - I know but I can't bend.
I'll give anything you want. Delete what you have filmed.
You are a public servant. Supposed to serve us.
Not rob us. - Anna made me corrupt.
Those bribe us aren't ashamed, why should we be?
First tackle with them. Then come to us.
Even what you said is recorded. It is enough.
For such simple crime, you used such hi-technology?
Did you bring a new party? - No. Old party.
I'm afraid Sitaramnagar issue will create problem.
Is it the one Devraj claimed? - Yes. - 500 acres? - Yes.
But court passed judgment against them.
They plan to go to High court. - They've no brains, only anger.
That is what they say. - They can say anything.
When do they realise we became ministers only to make money?
Anyway they're doing right thing. It will teach Devraj a lesson.
But he gives you share. - You remember everything.
You tell me that once a day. - I'm a fool to tell you.
He promised me 5 crores. But gave me only 4 but...
gave 10 crores to Home minister who has no relation to it.
Gave CM, 50 crores.
But he gave you 4 plots in your brother-in-law's name.
Leave it. See that I get my one crore. Leave the rest to me.
I recorded all you want. Please delete my part.What's the hurry?
We will do it tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Come with us.
We don't disappoint our guest. Watch TV. - You tied me up!
Greetings, sir!
Sending. Boy, keep a cartoon in rascal's jeep.
Look at the rogue.
Stop it.
Stop it, I say.
I'll kill you rogues. Get lost. It has become fashion to...
take law into our hands. Who are they ?
Murderers. Number of my enemies have increased.
Hope you are fine. - I'm fine. Thanks a lot.
I messed with you earlier. I'm very sorry.
Come to my home. - No. I can't.
You drank 5 bottles in 5 minutes. You have great capacity.
I've a friend. He finishes 10 bottles in 5 minutes.
I'll go to bathroom then finish the rest.- Finish before you go.
I can't wait.
You are saved the last time.
This time I'll cut off your hands if you touch him.
Who are you?
Untie me first.
Go.
Come. - Come. Untie me. Don't keep staring.
You rascal, untie me.
Why is he removing my pant?
You go and help him.
You untie me at least.
Don't remove my underwear.
You go and do your part.
Seal the tap.
Had I known you would do this,
I'd have relieved myself in the pant.
I swear on my mother. Give you anything you want.
Let me go. I beg of you.
We will leave you if you answer our questions.
Ask. - We complained when Devraj's men killed...
and grabbed our land. Why didn't you lodge it?
Wait a minute.
Now talk. - To ignore their atrocity, Devraj gave me a lakh.
Untie me. - You should know the suffering you caused to public.
Make him drink one more bottle of bear.
This time we will do it on grand scale.
Switch on your laptop. - Who are you?
Your husband.
Do you know whom are you talking to?
Switch on the laptop.
Open messenger.
Open web cam.
Shocked! - You shock others always.
No. I'll give you shock.
Let's meet again. - Okay, sir.
Good. You've a pretty daughter. She isn't gone on you I presume.
If you call anyone there, I'll pull the trigger here.
Don't harm her. How much money you want, son.
My friend Ravi is outside. Call him inside.
Hey, call my man Ravi in.
Come in. Sit. Why are you here?
You should come to a function at my house.
Which function? - Death anniversary.
Whose? - Not yet decided.
Go with him quietly. - Let's go.
Anna, you promised contribution to temple celebration.
Anna is kidnapped. Catch them.
Come out. - Where is my daughter?
If you want her safety, come out.
Untie me.
I'm telling you, untie me.
Untie me.
What do you want? Why did you kidnap me?
I want answers to my questions.
You ask me and I answer them!
If not you won't go out normal.
What do you want to know?
I want to know why one can't have a own house...
at least in 100 yards of land?
I want to know why people like you hike land prices and...
play with our lives?
I want to know who all are involved in land grabbing?
I want to know why we vote rogues like you...
to power again and again?
Want to know why is the law unable to punish you people?
How do I know?
Some youth are behind MLA Devraj's kidnap.
Devraj is a accused of land grabbing many times, in the past.
These youth're going to make him to tell some horrifying truths.
Only thing is Devraj doesn't know he is on air.
Pingali Venkataramiah's isn't natural death.You get him killed.
This is enough to put you behind bars.
Who are those goons? What way I'm connected to them?
So what if you will give it in police station?
Those idiots should have the guts to lodge a case.
So, you think they are idiots. - Then what?
I don't know if government pays salary in time, but I pay them.
I feed biscuits to my dogs, to them, money.
But all police aren't your stooges.
I know. That's why I made the Commissioner my stooge.
When he is under my control what can police do to me? Nothing.
Which police station will put me behind bars? Ameerpet?
Jubli Hills? Banjara hills?
Have you seen Devraj talk shit about you on TV?
Do you believe it?
I know what a rogue you are, save yourself from public.
If caught you will not have head to wear your cap.
You have seen how nicely the police are servicing us.
Watch it.
When Sitaramanagar was grabbed...
Devraj paid me a lakh to look the other way.
We have captured Ravi. - You caught him? I'm coming.
Where is Devraj? - I won't tell.
Tell us. This time I'll...
Go, tell Devraj that all police are not his pet dogs.
I killed Pingali Venkataramiah.
I made MRO to testify that Sitaramnagar is mine.
Oh, he ruined me.
What if I go to minister? - Which minister?- Home minister.
That fool Purushotham?
He can only condemn crimes in news papers.
He came into police to save himself from his past murders.
What can he do to me?
I gave him 10 crores not to get even the idea.
Sir, I found out the source of this telecast. I'll arrest them.
I see as if I don't know. Don't get excited. Sit down.
They are doing what no one else can do. Enjoy watching it.
Not only Home minister, Revenue minister Kasinath is in it too.
He promised me 5 crores. He gave me one less.
He gave Home minister 10 crores. To CM, 50 crores.
What a trap!
What if we go to CM directly?
Go to CM!
I told you he is a worthless fellow. - You,
He is the key person, who helped me.
I told him to give statement that Airport is going to...
come up around Sitaramnagar.
He took 50 crores to do it.
These are the people whom we elected? They improve our lives!
Hemu, find those rogues and shut them up. Stop the telecast.
I'm doing it.
DGP, any news of it? CM is bombarding me.
I'm on that job, sir. - Quick. - Okay, useless fellow.
Last question. SI, court, govt. can't do anything against you.
What about people? Will they keep quiet?
What can they do otherwise?
When I walk on the road, holding the sword...
they get terrified. Piss in their pants.
Put TV, channel 5.
They are showing how worthless people we all are.
You fool, if there is any No.1 scapegoats in this world...
it is public. They cast their vote blindly...
for one bottle of alcohol.
What can those useless fellows do to us?
Find out where he is. I'll kill him.
Many governments fell down because of people.
You are after all an MLA.
I bought them with drinks. They have to tolerate me for 5 years.
They have to remain spectators to whatever I do.
I'll kill him if I see him. Come on. Kill him.
If they are angry with me, they vote for another fellow.
If they are angry with them...
You are sitting listening?
Atleast now if we don't act, we are useless. Come on...
To you people are so cheap!
Of course yes. Since the time they wake up from sleep...
they are on run to maintain their families.
The world is like a maze for them.
They are struggling to look after themselves.
Devraj claims he killed your grandpa. What's your comment?
I don't think people will keep quiet now.
Of course not. Devraj killed a man like Mahatma Gandhi.
We won't leave him. Let's go.
Down with Devraj!
Atrocities... must end.
I'm a Devraj's goon. I've a plot too in Sitaramnagar.
I could do nothing to Devraj.
When you are all doing so much for society...
if I still support him, I'm not a human. Please go ahead.
The united decision of ours is...
until each one of us can afford a land...
no one will buy or sell land.
Do you think these corrupt officers will serve us sincerely?
They demand money to sign documents.
Next time they do it, we will cut off that arm.
My throat is dry by all this talk. Give me water.
I made much higher authorities drink water (taught lesson).
Why not to you?
Where is my daughter? - Safe, in your house.
You're under the impression that no one can do anything to you.
Its waste to keep you here.
When government becomes like mafia, what can people do?
They take law into their hands.
That is what is happening here.
'People became the soldiers.
'Confront the enemies.
'Confrontation is unavoidable.
Be alert all of you.
People in all districts of Andhra have taken over...
Registrar offices in their district.
Registrations have come to a standstill.
Don't harm me. Let me go. Don't do it.
Those photos made us a good deed.
Hey you, come. I beg you. Tell us who used to send those photos?
Tell them.
It's brother. - You!!
Yes. We planned to kill Devraj. To me that wasn't right.
So, pressed the remote late.
Because, some other greedy person will replace him.
So killing was not the solution.
Agreed. But why is the drama of sending photos?
For unity. - For unity!!
Devraj isn't alone in it. It's an organisation.
To destroy it, we need united force.
We are friends for so long. Yet we have no unity.
Only after the photos arrived, out of fear all of you...
have come together.
Only then we could unite people. I couldn't have done it alone.
You too were in the photos. Then how could you click photos?
With remove camera.
So, as elders said unity is strength.
