No time to date.
The hospital keeps her too busy
She was always first in her class.
Not like my lazy Raymond
He never opens a book,
only his wallet
At 29, he's already VP of his company.
What are you complaining about?
Yeah, money seems to cling to him,
but what's the use?
He's only 5'8"
Let me tell you…
…every Friday, Wilhelmina
comes home for the dance
Good. See you there tonight
Be discrete. Nothing kills romance
faster than a mother's approval
Have faith, I know what to do
And make sure his hands are clean.
It’s flu season
I’ll wash them myself if I have to
You're late again
- All the crab is gone.
- This party's a bust. Let's go to KFC
Cheeky girl
So thin. You'll catch your death
I see men's clothes
are still in style
Let me button that for you.
People are going to think….
Wil, I love your outfit!
Don't you think it's too boyish?
Nonsense
I had a pair just like those
during the Revolution
Sturdy and practical.
Just the thing for war
Your high heels on the other hand….
Those things will kill you
It’ll be a miracle
if you don't trip and die
I’m going to get some squid
Hey, Grandma
Good to see you, Old Yu
Let me say a few words
As the lazy toads
of summer give way…
…to the crackling
of autumn leaves…
…one's mind naturally turns toward
the demise of our children's education
I give thanks to the woman
who has suffered alongside me
- I toast you.
- Okay, no more suffering. Let's eat
Look at those two
Don't their faces
reflect good marriage chi?
Depends on whose marriage
Hey, Albert!
Don't eat too much of that cabbage
It gives you gas!
Your Raymond is such a gentleman
Anyone looks good on his arm
Another great party
My husband and I fought
all the way over here
But I’m having a great time.
Is there more wine?
They say her ex-husband has a
new wife 20 years younger than her
Serves her right.
He made good money
What's to be unhappy about?
Marry a rooster, follow the rooster.
Marry a dog, follow the dog
Why be like those Americans,
divorcing all the time?
She'll never marry again.
Women never do
She's certainly not meeting
anyone here
Still…
…must be lonely at these parties
without a man
What do you think those morons
talk about anyway?
The usual ball scratching
They say he's got a new wife
on the Upper East Side
I heard she's 20 years younger
My back hurts just thinking about it
I plan to be married soon myself
Anyone in mind?
Good luck. You'll have to get
past her father first
Just plain friends
Forget meat on the grill,
and it will dry out
- Right. So my ma says.
- Does she?
She's quite a woman
Ever since your father passed away,
she's been so delicate
These 20-odd years
you've been all she has
Wilhelmina!
Yeah. She's delicate
I’m not feeling so well.
Take me home
It’s those heels, I tell you!
Thanks, Little Yu
Home to see your grandparents?
I have station duty Friday nights
From my father
He still telling fortunes?
As long as there are anxious wives
and mothers, he'll be in business
Your mother asked him
to give you some herbs…
…to improve your fortitude
for marriage
Give it a try. Those herbs
are good for your heart anyway
Professor, your chi is so potent…
…you've managed to hold
the court once again
No fortunes to tell this morning,
Old Yu?
Most people don't want to hear
the truth until after lunch
Fate is for the lazy
Too true, too true
But I won't lie,
my only morning customer…
…was your only daughter
Her?
What does she have to worry about?
She lives safely at home with us
Her daughter's a doctor
- What more could she want?
- Indeed
But her health may be a bit bumpy
this year
Ridiculous. She's only 48
Could be menopause
Menopause?
Nonsense
Only Americans freak out
about menopause
Thank God you're here!
I’ve been waiting for hours
This is a crummy neighborhood
Take this
Do I look sick to you?
Pick up that bag
Don't be ridiculous.
She'll outlive us all
Do I look like I’m crying?
You're just going to let me
freeze to death here?
Tell me what happened
All right. I’m calling Grandma
Is that how you speak to your ma
who worked nights so you could eat?
Who stayed in labor
without painkillers…
…so you wouldn't turn dim-witted
like your cousin Jimmy?
Had I known
you would grow so ungrateful…
…I would have held you in
Has she eaten?
What is she doing here?
She'll need better nutrition now
She's not that old
Wait, I can't hear. Ma
Can you pipe down?
It’s good for her to stay with you.
You're a doctor
You can help her…
…maybe get free drugs
from the hospital
- Okay.
- You'll pick up her things tomorrow
- I’ll bring her back tomorrow.
- I'll prepare herbs from Old Yu
They'll help her with the baby
- Pregnant!
- At her age!
- It’s a scandal!
- A disgrace!
- It’s better than the soaps!
- More drama!
- More intrigue!
- More eel!
Don't eat so much eel!
It gives you gas
Who's the father?
Who is the father?
- Father.
- Don't call me Father!
You are the biggest disgrace,
the ultimate shame
What kind of example are you
for your daughter?
- You're not pregnant too are you?
- Me? No. No
No daughter has shamed her parents
more than you
What have we done
to deserve this?
Do you have any idea
who the father is?
Can't bring it up
She just cries and goes on
about how ungrateful I am
How did you find out she was…?
The receptionist
at the Manhattan clinic…
…is married to one
of Grandpa's former students
He's going to banish her
from Flushing. Where will she go?
He can't do this to her.
She belongs here
Who is the father?
You won't tell us? Fine
Take all the ones
with your mother in them
She is no longer
a part of this family
Father. Don't be like this
When I think of all we've sacrificed
in the old country…
…to give you kids a better life
in the new one
Had I known, I would have left you
behind in the mainland
Father, please don't feel shamed
How can I not feel shame?
My own rotten flesh has gotten
pregnant without a husband
You don't think people
will laugh at me?
The professor speaks big words…
…but can't control his own daughter?
Old man, this situation won't improve
with yelling
She wasn't even going to tell us
She can throw her own reputation
away, but it still comes back to me
Still crying?
Get out of this house
Don't come back until you have
a husband to match the child
Look how cheerful this red is.
We'll put some up here…
…there and there!
That black is just depressing
You have no oyster sauce
I don't use oyster sauce
Since when do you drink beer?
You shouldn't keep this stuff
unless you plan to use it
Do you plan to keep the…?
What kind of vegetable is this?
I see you just let my face masks
waste away
- What's this?
- Herbs from Old Yu
Every week, he has his son
Little Yu give them to me…
…to improve my marriage chi
or something
Don't be rude,
just hiding them here
I want to have a look
The big one is for your mother.
Morning sickness
You're home
Turn up the TV
It’s just getting to the good part
She's dumping him
Smells great, right? Stinky tofu
No, that's just a special treat
We have chicken, sweet pea stalks,
and fish with bean sauce
Is he coming?
Safer this way.
Throw it out afterwards
I’ll give him two
His shoes! His shoes!
You remember my neighbor, Jay
His shoes!
Your neighbor is loud and dark
and eats too much soy sauce
Americans like soy sauce
I’m going to start eating less
soy sauce…
…so it won't stain the baby too dark
You eat less too,
so you don't grow spots
Too late for him anyway
Excuse me.
Do you have Chinese movies?
Have you eaten?
How long have you been pregnant?
A couple of months
Married?
Once
Children are a blessing
just the same
Number 48
- We need to see the patient alone.
- I’ll be right here
Don't forget. I invited
the mahjong ladies over tonight
So don't bring
any of your friends over
You should get home in time
to say hello to them
You haven't seen them in so long
You missed the mahjong party
I’m not going on a date
Too puffy, better up.
But I’m not going
What's wrong with it?
Chinese people cannot wear yellow
How about this one? It’s sexy
No one wants to see a 50-year-old
Chinese woman look sexy
Ma, you're only 48
Connie Chung's sexy,
and she must be nearly 60
Her show was cancelled
- Is it a white guy?
- No
An ugly old white guy
No. He's Chinese
He's nice, very healthy
Pretty healthy
I’m not going
I’m really not going
Then you go
I don't have enough time
Tell him I’m sick
Lost my voice
What am I going
to talk about anyway?
Forty-eight and going on a date
It’s okay
We have enough time
Look. This dress isn't bad
We'll just take your hair down
What?
What are you looking at?
Do I tell him about the baby?
So, Mr. Fu,
what is your line of work?
I’m in import-export
- Good business?
- Not bad, not bad
Made enough last month
to go on a singles cruise to Fiji
Not that I went
- You're an only daughter?
- Yes
I always wish I had kids
No kids? Do you want any?
No, it's not necessary.
I’m too old now
Besides, I’m fixed down there
Hello, my name is Fu Cheng Wen
Gao Hwei Lan
Can we go now?
- What time are you getting back?
- Before midnight
You're a doctor?
I’ve got a wart on my left calf.
It’s driving me nuts
Can you tell me if it's cancer?
My last wife made me take lessons
The whole year, she would scream：
Fung Ling restaurant
Huge she-crab. So much egg
I think I’m too old to have a child
If these are my dating options…
…I am definitely too old
There's not much left on this tape
Why are you in street clothes?
I can't believe you came
from my womb
No. He's marrying her for money
No
That's his brother
He's the most evil of them all
He wants to ruin her family
to avenge a grudge
That's the good guy
I have found her a husband
She will marry Cho. To the right
I don't think Ma likes him
What's not to like? Back left
He's kind of intense
Who cares?
He's a good man
who will take care of your mother…
…and give both her
and that child a decent name
Where can you find
a man like that?
You will help her see this
I don't think she sees anything
she doesn't want to
She shouldn't be alone
Don't listen to him
Another misunderstanding.
Now they'll never get together
He didn't really. He was drunk
She'd be lonely
Are you lonely?
No, I have you
Why?
It’s too late for me
- What about a father for your child?
- I raised you single-handedly
You turned out all right
I just think you should give
that Cho a chance
Then you wouldn't be alone…
…and it would make
Grandpa happy
Enough soap opera for today
I’m going to be a terrible mother
I don't even like babies
Stephen's always bringing his kid
to the shop
All that drooling. Gross
You were different
You sprung from the womb
already grown-up
And I had your father
during your early years
He was really patient
You have me
Fish is good, Auntie
What do you do?
Vivian's a dancer
A go-go dancer?
I dance with
the New York City Ballet
Oh, ballet
But now I’m…
…taking a break to dance modern
She's very, very good
Not ballet
So is the baby good?
She works too hard
I hardly get to see her
So do you have a boyfriend?
No
Pretty girl like you must have
lots of boys ask you out
Wil’s black neighbor is single…
…always around
You interested?
- You don't like black people?
- Sure, I like--
- She doesn't like black people.
- Yes, she does
- Then why won't she date them?
- Let's just eat
I just want to make sure
my baby gets home safe
Hey, Little Yu.
Isn't my daughter beautiful?
She is indeed
- Say thank you.
- Thank you
Thank your father.
I’ll be calling him tonight
Little Yu's got a solid job
and good benefits
- Great crab, isn't it?
- Smells delicious
There's an old tradition
in Shanghai
They pick their son-in-law based on
his skill at extracting his crab meat
What am I saying?
You can't have crab
because of the--
Your child would be my child
I would make sure you have anything
you want for the rest of your life
I just want you to be happy
There are many women
who would be happy with you
Wouldn't you rather
have someone younger?
Younger people. Today they love you.
Tomorrow, who knows?
It’s better to stick with someone
who can really understand you
Besides…
…I’ve liked you for over 15 years
I had a lovely time
You look lovely in this light
Wonder how the gang is doing
over at the salon
Carrying one child and sending
the other out to do her dirty work
She never could
take care of herself
Who could the father be?
Do you think the father…
…is someone in our circle?
No way. Fred is too respectful
Len is too scared
Too lazy
Too busy losing money
Thank God
Good to know we're safe
Hello, Wilhelmina.
How is that mother of yours?
Didn't you see her the other day
at her mahjong party?
Oh, no. I was busy.
I wasn't able to make it
Me too.
Everyone's so busy these days
I heard no one went
What?
He's a nice man
I just told you. I like him fine
Mr. Cho took you to the hospital?
He's a good man
Don't worry, Professor Gao.
Your wife's okay
My daughter
What were you all so worried about?
Haven't I been healthy all these years?
This is nothing compared to war
Don't excite yourself
That's right, Mrs. Gao.
Just relax
You relax. Preferably elsewhere.
I want to speak to my granddaughter
I’ll be back later
Me too
Thank God they're gone
Like I’m so bored I have to listen
to his asinine pandering!
How's your mother?
She's doing well
You're talking to me
She's totally depressed
and humiliated
Don't tell her about this
How can I not?
She has enough on her mind
Your grandfather forbids her
to come anyway
It’ll just make her feel bad
I’ll be out soon
Promise you won't tell her
until I’m back home
Grandma….
Promise me
You're just in time
She's watching his plane
take off for the States
Stupid girl,
he's so obviously right for you
We need to talk
There's not much left on this tape
I don't think this can wait
I love you
And I’m gay
How can you say
those two things at once?
How can you tell me you love me…
…then throw that in my face?
I am not a bad mother
My daughter is not gay
Then maybe I shouldn't be
your daughter
My dad said this is for the bride
"Hwei Lan…
…you keep refusing to see me
By the time you read this…
…you may already be Cho's bride
You've said this is the way
fate would have it…
…but if it is your fate
to do your father's bidding…
…then it is my fate to try…
…and undo yours
Yes, people would talk
about the age difference…."
It's Old Yu!
I may not be what you pictured
as your future
But I know now that I am the one
destined for you
I love you
I know you love me
Shouldn't this be simple?
Twenty-nine years ago…
…you married a man you didn't love
to be the perfect daughter…
…and now you're doing it again,
all for your father's honor
Wait!
Wait a moment!
What's going on?
I read the letter. I know
Wil, quiet! You're causing a scene!
You know what? What letter?
Don't marry him!
Marry the one you love
Wait a minute
You don't love me?
Of course she loves you!
Say it! You love him!
No!
No, she doesn't
She loves him!
This is a mistake!
It’s not me! It’s not me!
- Yes, it is!
- No, it's not!
Wilhelmina!
It’s me
Are you insane?
- That woman's karma kills husbands!
- Pa, I love her!
I told you to marry
the Hong Kong movie star!
At least she doesn't have kids!
- If you want a divorce, just say so!
- You want it!
- Idiot, I love you!
- Dog fart! I love you!
I am indebted to you…
…but I don't love you
I am so sorry
I can't
You have thrown away
a lifetime of my reputation!
Father, please
Fantastic! I’ll move back in with you
We'll need a bigger bed,
so the baby can sleep with me
Later, we'll block off the living room
for her crib and--
We really should repaint.
Rose beige would be nice
It would warm the place up nicely!
He's young
Handsome
He could have anyone
Today he loves me
Tomorrow, who knows?
I guess I needed him to declare it.
Not just to me, but to everyone
Besides, I’d never dated before
I may as well see what's out there
You know…
…that Vivian…
…she seems nice
You like her, don't you?
Stop the bus!
You're late as usual
Wil, it's been so long
Busy lately? Try some of this jerky
Yeah, it's been a busy spring
Well, a full belly conquers all
So now will you let me move in?
No way!
This is the first time
I’ve ever had my own place
You're gonna cramp my style
The world is getting too hard
to predict
It just keeps getting worse
Revolting!
Let's go
One more bite
Stop patting that side.
The baby will turn out lopsided
Don't be silly
Well said!
The moment that girl is born,
I’m coming over every day
God knows how she'll turn out
if she's brought up by you two
Nice shirt, Vivian
Now why can't you wear
something pleasant like that?
So there's only one thing left
When are you going to have a baby?
