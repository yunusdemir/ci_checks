-You are so sly.  You promised me.
-Wait a minute. -No. It's not that.
Don't you hear it a little?
-What is that noise?
-Darn you, you promised.
No!  You can't really hear that?
Ok, I will tell you. I don't

-Serious?
-It's true.
-That's no good.
-I really don't have a boyfriend.

Knock it off!
-What? -What time is now? I

Rabbit? How can you forget
something like that?
-Miiiizuuuhoooo.

No.
Tsuyoshi!
Tsuyoshi!
Mizuho
Tsuyoshi!
Tsuyoshi!
Oh, Tezuka.
Did you come with Tsuyoshi?
Huh, no I didn't. But
his bike is over there.
yeah. I know.
He is probably still inside of school.
-Did you call him? Did you
get a hold of him? -No.
Yesterday, Mr. Nakumuea
took his cell phone.
Damn.
-Is that it?
-Yeah, I found it over there.
I wonder if he came with someone?
Well if you wait for him,
you will see him. Later.
Wait a minute. Please help me look for him.
Hey!
What are you doing? I am locking up
the school so hurry up and go home.
But um I am waiting for my friend.
Friend? What are you talking about?
here is nobody inside. I just checked.
But um...
But his bike is over there
and uh that is also his bag.
He is probably still here.
What is your class and name?
-huh?
-Your class and name?
I am in the 2nd year 4th class.
My name is Tamura Mizuho.
Come to the teacher's room.
OK.
What are you doing?
Who is your teacher?
I am going to tell your teacher about this.
Hurry up.
This is an announcement. 2nd
year 4th class Murakami.
2nd year 4 class Tsuyoshi Murakami.
Please come to the teacher's office.
I repeat, 2nd year 4th class Murakami.
2nd year 4th class Tsuyoshi Murakami.
Please come to the teacher's room.
Well, I check inside of the school again.
You should wait here.
If he comes here, don't
go home until I get back.
-Do you understand?
-Yes.
Hello.. This is Tamura.... I wonder
if Tsuyoshi had come back home.
Yes.
I see.
I know the number.
I understa.. huh?
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
Are you still there?
Hello?
Hello?
Kanna
Doctor, you found something?
There was a dead rabbit's body mixed
in the body's blood and tissues.
Yes, I saw it at the scene.  Anything else?
There are no signs that anybody
else had a hand in this.
The body appears to have
been twisted and broken.
What is that?
It was found in the dismembered body.
A jaw?
Yes. It is a human's jaw.
It is somebody else's.
There was another person at the scene?
Perhaps.
They didn't find the body
that the jaw was from.
We have sent samples to the
lab to try to match the DNA.
The body missing the jaw is gone.
What is the cause of death of this person?
Actually, I don't
understand that very well.
The body is so badly broken
and twisted we can't
say the cause of death
was heart failure.
This is my first time
seeing a body like this.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We talked to the teacher who is a witness
and it appears a little after 2 pm...
...the two third year girls went to the
middle school to feed the rabbits.
This is Hisae Yoshia and
this is Kanna Murakami.
-Say, Kamio.
-Yes.
Is it possible for a
person who lost a jaw like
that to still be alive?
What do you think?
Impossible.
I am home.
Wrong address again.
Kanna! I got ice cream, do you want some?
Hello, this is Murakami.
Ok, please wait a minute.
Tsuyoshi!
Tsuyoshi!
Tsyoshi!
Kanna!
Where is Tsuyoshi?
Hello.  He hasn't came back home yet.
Perhaps he is still on his way here.
Do you know his cell number?
Why don't call his cell phone?
Just a minute, it looks
like he just got back.
Tsuyoshi?  Are you back?
ou have a phone call.
Kanna?
Kanna?
You?
Who are you?
ayako
es. Yes. Yes.
No.  I will be late.
That is right.
His parents still haven't came back yet.
The child?   He is sleeping?
Yes. Somebody came.
Yes.  I will call you later.  OK.
Toshio.
Toshio.
Toshio.
Toshio.
Toshio.
Toshio.
-Mother, did I do good?
-Toshio!
-You did good. Really good.
Mother, Where Are you going?
My teacher is here.
I see.
Teacher said that he came
to meet you, Mother.
Toshio!
Its true.  Father and I.
I am opening the door.
Toshio.
Toshio, were you talking to somebody?
Your parents are late, aren't they?
Kobayashi
Today, I had eyes with Kobayashi.
My heart began to fill and beat rapidly.
Thoughts of him are inside of my head.
Kobayashi today again...
And then he read manga while standing
Kobayashi didn't come to school today...
Kobayashi often reads while standing
Every week ... But tomorrow,
Kobayashi will certainly get better
Every night ... That girl
is acting too familiar
with Kobayashi and is
following my Kobayashi
She is always with my
Kobayashi I worry about
Kobayashi because has a
weakness for alcohol
but because I am better than that woman
Because I know where Kobayashi lives
In Kobayashi's room, probably
his favorites are...
I took drunk Kobayashi to his apartment.
I went to his apartment many times
The two of us rode a taxi.
Kobayashi drank too much sake
Sleeping Kobayashi...
Painful Kobayashi...
Toshio!  Toshio!
Lets not stay here.
Wait here.
Tsuyoshi, let's go!
Hello.
So this is Mr Kobayashi.
I am Saeki.  Tokeo Saeki.
I'm Kayako's husband.
Have you met with Kayako?
After today, please take care of Toshio.
What are you saying?
I took care of Toshio instead of you,
now take your turn.
Lets take turns.
Instead of me?  Take turns?
Oh, Mr Kobayashi, your baby was born.
Born?
You baby is here, it's a girl.
Hello, mother?
Yes. Yes. I understand.
Kobayashi.
Kyoko
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
You are busy as usual.
Yeah... Please sit.
I am leaving.
OK, see you later.
Kyoko, you done with work today?
Yes.
How about a little bit?
What's wrong?
Thank you, but no thanks.
Nobuyuki-kun is probably waiting at home.
You are the only one for your son.
OK. OK. OK. I understand.
What was that you said you
wanted to talk about?
Yea, Sis, I would like
you to see one house.
You want me to look?
Yea, just one house that is for sale.
It's not consignment or something.
What do you mean?
Yea, we have one house now.
The house has had a past.
A past?
Previously there was a
family who live there.
They died and their
bodies became missing.
Well the way I look at it, it will be OK
if somebody buys it soon.
But nobody has bought it, yet.
I think having an exorcism is a
little excessive, am I right?
I am afraid that will
scare more people off.
Sis, I want your unique
opinion and insight.
My opinion? You want me to do it today?
Well just a little, it is only
looking around the house.
It was a complete failure.
Well originally we got the house
cheap because of the incident.
It is a nice house and still is pretty.
I don't know where people
heard about the house and the incident.
There is even a rumor about
the house on the Internet.
I am surprised that you are
worried about that, because
normally this kind of
stuff doesn't affect you.
I am being a little superstitious.
If we can't sell the house
we will lose money.
I still have to pay Shinobu alimony.
It is nice and quiet around here.
Here it is.
MURAKAMI Residence
Hey, what's wrong?
After the deaths the police investigated,
they left everything inside the house.
I hope the buyers will buy the house with
everything left inside of it.
Hey, you already feel something?
The incident that was here,
you said MURAKAMl-sans?
Yea. Well the father is alive.
There was only one person left?
Where is he now?
According to the police statements,
he is in the hospital.
I see.
His wife and her daughter
died at the same time.
That's wrong!
There wasn't only two
people that died here!
What?
I don't understand this very well.
Well. Come inside.
SAEKI TAKEO Saeki.
Who is this person?
They lived here before MURAKUMl-san did.
As I say cheap things come with trouble.
It is quiet around here,
and the station is also
close so I thought I
could sell this place.
Kyoko.
This house... It's too much for me.
Huh, wait a minute!
Is there Refined Sake here now?
Refined Sake?
You mean a Japanese Sake?
Bring it!
Is this OK?
Promise me you will do what I say from now.
OK?
What are you saying?
OK?!
Yes.
Before somebody buys this house,
make them drink this sake.
Huh?
Promise me!
If the customer says that sake
isn't any good or spits it out,
never sell the house to them.
What a minute. What are you saying?
Refined Sake reacts naturally
to the presents of spirits.
During ancient times it was often used to
bless everything on ceremony alters.
OK.
A person will be able to taste a difference
in sake that has been touched by spirits.
So if a person who drinks
the sake and the taste is
strange, the house is too
dangerous for that person.
OK.
Leave the sake in this room for some time.
Promise before somebody buys this house
you will make them drink this sake.
I have to go!
Hey, Kyoko!
Kyoko!
I am sorry. I need to leave
this house as soon as possible.
Room 205
SUZUKI Residence
What? You sold the house?
Why didn't you call me
before you sold the house?
Is that so?
Did you do what I asked you to do?
Yeah, the sake, right?
Yes, it was OK.
They drank it.
They were OK when they drank it.
They loved the house.
It's OK. Don't worry
Can you come to my home in a couple days?
What for?
Nobuyuki has been looking
and acting strange lately.
He doesn't say anything to anybody.
He'd gone through a lot of things, though.
Yes. I will come.
Hello, this is SUZUKI Speaking.
I am trying to quickly find out something.
Is it possible for you
to help me, Sato-kun?
Yes.
I have the name and address for an
incident that occurred 1 to 2 years ago.
Here.
Thank you.
SUZUKl-san, you are curious.
I don't know what you are investigating.
That incident is dangerous.
A lot of people died.
And they are still missing.
There are still no answers
to what happened.
Well, SUZUKl-san, you can't die, you know.
See ya!
Thanks.

It's not good to buy
different coffee beans.
We decided to buy Jamaican
Blue Mountain Coffee.
You grew up in Aoyama, so
you know nothing about life.
(Aoyama is a rich area in Tokyo)
The egg yolk...
I always say to make the yolk runny.
I think that she should go to
the hospital to see a doctor.
I don't think that a doctor
can fix what she has.
You always say that.
What can we do for Kyoko?
Don't you understand.
She doesn't have an ordinary illness.
Don't say that.
Mom...
I think father is right.
Tatsuya.
You know something, don't you?
Did something...
happen to Kyoko?
The apartment... Nobuyuki
and I moved in...
Well...
Kyoko was possessed in
the apartment by something.
Dear?!
Shut up and listen.
Kyoko...
since she has been little
she sees strange things such as ghosts.
When I was a child, I saw ghosts.
So it was easy for me to
understand about Kyoko.
Dear, you never mentioned
this to me before.
I didn't tell you.
What if I told you?
If I told you about seeing ghosts,
it would only scare you.
But I didn't think Kyoko
would be effected like this.
I shall be happy...
Even if she is sick,
even if she is possessed
I want Kyoko to become better.
Tatsuya, please do something.
Tatsuya Tatsuya.
Stop it.
He can't do anything, don't talk nonsense.
Tatsuya.
You should go home soon.
You... But... Kyoko...
It is not only Kyoko problem.
Tatsuya,
Go home now
and do something about your home.
If you don't do something soon,
you will be taken too.
Hello?
Oh its me.
Eh?
Now?
Uh. Nothing.
I am going to KITADA-san's place
and then I will return to the office.
I will be a little late.
President, Kyoko-san is waiting.
She has been waiting for some time.
What should I do?
Uh?
What are you talking about?
I am hanging up.
Hello?
Hello?
As I said earlier, he will be late today.
Is that so.
Yes.
Hello.
Good afternoon.
I apologize for me not calling

It is no trouble.
Please make yourself comfortable.
I will make some tea.
Please don't trouble yourself over me.
Wow.

Here you go.
Please have a seat.
Where is your husband today?
Eh.
Unfortunately he has been
out since this morning.
Is there something you want to talk about?
Oh no. I just happened to
be passing by the area.
I see.
My husband also has been ecstatic
since we moved into our home.
So you are going to have a baby next?
My husband and I like children.
We hope to have one soon...
Ah, please excuse me.
Speaking of children. SUZUKl-san,
you have a child, don't you?
Yes. He is in his first year
at Junior High School.
Say... What is this?
My child drew this.
Uh?
He doesn't like me to
put his drawing there.
Uh?
But this says SAEKI...
Ma 'am?
Unfortunately today...
he's been out since this morning.
What did you want to talk about?
Hey!
That's enough!
Oh dear! Kyoko Laughed
Kyoko, laughed!
Well...
I... I am leaving now...
That is
my diary.
Hello?
Is something wrong?
No.
KAMIO
Ahh, Boss has a nice house.
IIZUKA.
Don't say anything unnecessary.
Yes.
Yes?
Hello. It's been a long time.
How do you do? I am IIZUKA.
YOSHIKAWA-san... is he at home?
He can't see you.
Wait.
YOSHIKAWA-san quit suddenly.
He has helped us out a lot.
We weren't able to thank him.
My husband is unable to meet anybody now.
Is he sick?
Yes, he is.
He doesn't feel well.
He was looking better before...
I will tell him that you two came.
KAMIO-san?
What is wrong with YOSHIKAWA-san?
Dazzling.
But it is warm.
I know that.
That... That is
YOSHIKAWA-san, isn't he?
Hey Stop!
Please leave.
Probably 1 month before
his mother and grandparents
committed suicide.
Now he is living with a distant relative.
IIZUKA.
He and his mother lived
in that place before.
Have you heard about it?
No.
There was an incident with a teacher named
KOBAYASHI and his wife, do you remember?
It happened in an apartment, didn't it?
Yea.
Originally the KOBAYASHIS
live there before.
The same room
KOBAYASHI's wife was murdered there.
But it is just coincidence.
But...
How about the house where KOBAYASHI died?
After that, the MURAKAMIS moved in the
house and the mother and daughter died.
The son is still missing.
The father who is in the hospital
has been missing since last month.
After that
The KITADAS moved in and
are now missing too.
It seems people are dying and becoming
missing one after another.
The real estate agent SUZUKI.
The junior high school teacher and student.
After all that
only that kid hasn't
died or became missing.
All the missing people are not necessarily
dead.
Probably
there is a criminal involved in this.
YOSHIKAWA-san investigated this case
and now he is acting strange.
Do you really think you
can follow up this case?
But...
A few days ago,
I was looking through YOSHIKAWA-san's stuff
and found a strange picture.
A picture?
You should see this.
It is picture of the house while
YOSHIKAWA-san had it under surveillance.
In the window is KITADA YOSHIMI
before she became missing.
This is the picture of KITADA YOSHIMI
before she moved into the house.
IIZUKA.
What do you think looking at that?
She has changed a lot, don't you think?
Don't you think that she looks
like somebody else?
SAEKI.
KAYAKO.
What are you doing?
I don't care if people laugh at me.
I don't want to be involved in this case.
It will also be good for you to wash your
hands of this before something happens.
KAMIO-san...
Dear, it's time to get up.
Dear.
IIZUKA-san, you have a visitor.
I see.
Oh this person...
You know her?
She just came.
She's here?
Are you sure that she is here?
Couldn't it be just somebody
that looks like her?
What did this person do?
This person This person...
this person is already dead.
You are joking.
Then who did I see?
KAMIO-san! What happened?
KAMIO-san

That is ungentlemanly.
Shut up. I am cleaning.
You are doing nothing.

You girls are not ladylike!

That is enough.
They just don't understand.
Just leave them.
What?
Why don't you guys follow
Suzuki-kun as an example.
He's a little strange.
You two are much more stranger than him.
What makes us strange?
Tell me!
Hey, Nobuyuki.
Quit acting so serious.
Whoa... What did you do that for?
That was a creepy look.
Suzuki-kun, don't listen to them.
I agree.

She is looking at us.
What if she comes inside?
There is no reason for her to come in.
Kazumi, you are too timid.
What is that?

Why is it in this place?
Uh, I can't believe you.
What is this? It's not Sake!
What was that sound?
