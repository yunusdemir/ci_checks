When they intercepted a 707 of his
filled with Soviet weapons.

they found some interesting intercepts connecting Christo

It's hotter than two rats screwing

Africa-hot...

Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.
Lights. Three days ago,
two CIA agents, a Walter Ross and a Miss Lisa Morales,
were ambushed inside their hotel room here in Costa Rica
by a unknown amount of heavily armed assholes.
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss Morales has been abducted.
We believe that this has been the work
of a guy named Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.
LT's going to give you the skinny on him.
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.
This guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals
between the Russian mafia, the FARC
guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels
ever since the late 1990s.
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link
between our boy Christo and this guy Abu Shabal.
<i>Glory to Allah, Lord of the worlds,</i>
<i>who has created us as Muslims</i>
<i>and delivered us with the jihad on his direct path.</i>
<i>Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.</i>
<i>Let me explain this to you Americans.</i>
<i>We are not separatists.</i>
<i>We Chechens are not a legal part of anyone,</i>
<i>but you Americans are willingly or unwillingly assisting</i>
<i>in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,</i>
<i>and by your continued occupation of all Muslim countries.</i>
<i>With the grace of Allah, glorious and exalted is he,</i>
<i>America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.</i>
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>
LT: Abu Shabal is
a Chechen terrorist
who's associated with the Beslan School Massacre.
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the Philippines.
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,
but if this was the lead that Morales was working on,
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?
All right, this is a personnel recovery of Miss Morales.
All right, who's got questions?
Senior Chief, you got any updated source intel
on numbers inside the camp, and what about roving patrols?
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.
You're just gonna have to assume that they're out there
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.
- All right, what else?
- Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?
There was a ton of blood on the scene,
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,
so you're gonna have to bring stuff to carry her out.
MAN OVER PA:
<i>Two minutes to drop.</i>
Hey, LT.
You got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.
What guy?

that fucked-up haircut.

- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer
than I thought they were, and Shabal is a wild card, man.
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.
Yeah, and his childhood friend, Christo, the dope dealer?
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.
Shabal wants to kill Americans.
Christo knows how to get fuckers inside America.
This could be big trouble in little China, fellas.
They're gonna hit us at home.
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,
and this is what's gonna go down.
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.
They're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.
Why Africa?
We pinned an airfield there with that phone that you got,
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.
You'll be the primary assault force in case
something goes down anywhere near America.
- Check.
- Check.
You gonna be around for any questions as they come up?
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.
So I'm gonna link up with SEAL Team Four,
and we're gonna go hunt his ass down in the South Pacific.
So it's straight up Mai Tais and palm trees for me, baby.
Yeah, brother. Go get him.
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.
(LAUGHS)
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.
The important people to who? You?
- I guess so.
(LAUGHS)
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.
Hey, brother, I've never written one of these before.
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.
But, to be honest with you,
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.
You remember our last cruise to Al Anbar?
- Yeah.
- When you had that final
turnover op, and you said I didn't need to be there?
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.
But if something went south on your op,
I would always regret not being there with you.
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,
but I'm working some things with the brass.
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.
But, if it doesn't, I'm gonna take this piece of paper,
and I'm gonna make it into a nice paper airplane.
(LAUGHS)
Beat it.

We need you to get in, grab the intel
and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.
What if the meeting doesn't take place as scheduled?
How long do you want us to stay on target?
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.
- Check.

One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged
just landed on Cedros Island off the coast of Mexico.
It has Shabal on it with an unknown number of jihadis.
Are you kidding me?
No, looks like we're gonna get to hit that target.
Well, Senior and the SWCC boats are punching out.
They should pull a little more intel for us, so we'll see.

Christo.
- Crisco?
- Christo.
Troskawicz?
So how long am I gonna need to keep busting your balls
about getting one of those patches?
Ah, yeah, I think it was,
like, a one-time deal, man.
After 9/11, my uncle sent a bunch out for the platoon,
but, uh, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.
No, no, I'm not gonna take your family crest.
(CHUCKLES) All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.
Besides, man, I'm pretty sure I saw you
putting something in your cargo pocket the other day.
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying
something in that pocket right there.
What is it?
That's my grandfather's flag.
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me,
and now I'm gonna give it to my boy someday.
All right. I like that.
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.
- I believe it's called <i>Starship.</i>
<i>- "Starship".</i>
I love the way you say <i>Starship.</i>
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... <i>Star Trek.</i>
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes. You've never seen <i>Star Trek?</i>
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?
You're worth a lot of money.
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.
- You do?
- Yes.
All right. Let me tell you
how the world works there, Crisco.
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.
It's OK.
Let me tell you how the world really works.
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?
You're Jewish, right?
Shabal is what?
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?
Have you ever had a friend that you grew up with?
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,
or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.
And then you went on your separate ways,
and then some years later, you meet up.
And you totally didn't recognize the person.
And that's what happened with Shabal.
We share a common interest.
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.
You know, it's almost like...
...you know, it's almost like...
...like this is me.
(CLINKING)
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?
Yeah.
Cool concept, no?
- Right here?
- Yes.
You think this is some kind of game?
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?

(MAN SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE,

I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,
because you're gonna be sitting in a box somewhere.
You'll be treated properly and humanely.
That girl is gonna grow up, and she's gonna get married,
and your wife is gonna find someone else,
and you're gonna miss everything.
If I had done something that would endanger my family,
I would feel just like you do right now.
You promise not to touch my family?
I would never touch your family.
I would not.
Are you familiar with...
...ceramic ball bearings?
No.
Just imagine 16 suicide vests
filled with those ceramic ball bearings,
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.
You think your economy is fucked now?
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?
It's gonna make 9/11 look like a fucking walk in the park.
The grand Central Park.
So you're telling me...
...there's 16 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.
They're gonna walk right across the border.
So where are they going?
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...
You pick a city, they'll be there.

This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.
This is some high-speed shit.
Maybe we should put this somewhere else, huh?
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere to put this, would you?
Target secure.
Set security.
One's to the north, three south.
(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE)
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.
WOMAN OVER RADIO: <i>Actual, mission
not complete. Stand by for follow-on.</i>
You only got half that jihadist cell.
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border
using a tunnel network from Mexicali at 0700.
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off
outside the city where your POC is a Commander Pedros.
<i>I'll give you more details en route.</i>
<i>- Actual, how do you copy?</i>
- Roger, Main.
OK, we've got a helo landing on the deck,
we're gonna meet a Mexican SOF commander and his team.
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.
All right.
And the rest of the boys,
how are they getting back to the ship?
<i>Bon Homme Richard</i> stayed on station.
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.
When they're done, the boys will pull off with them.
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,
pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.
We're moving north of here through town,
and crossing at sunrise.
The other group will get into Texas the following day,
through Juarez.
<i>Comprendes?</i>
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot
to go to Mexicali anyway?
This one's going all the way up the flagpole.
State Department's on it.

Hey, sir. Channel two.

Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,
Jackie's gonna be squeezing that kid out on her own.
However, we hit this target quick enough, you
jump on a burro and ride that shit home.
(LAUGHING)
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.
Did you get your two weeks?
All that time I was spending on the sat phone,
it wasn't to convince them to let me go home,
it was to convince them to leave your ass in charge.
(BEEPING)
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?
All the way to the top, from what I hear.
There is something that you have to understand.
My superiors, they're very fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.
No <i>Black Hawk Down</i> is what they're saying,
so we do need to stay under the radar.
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.
Help piece this together for me.
- OK.
- Our intel says
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.
This mean anything to you?
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.
Then that's where we're going.
Of all of the places in Mexicali
that you could have picked, this is probably the worst.
The cartels control that area from all angles.
They have us heavily outgunned.
Simply reaching your target is gonna be very difficult.
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.
Needless to say, they are no big fan of ours.
If they are at that factory, that's where we're going.
Lieutenant, I'll take you anywhere you need to go,
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.
You're not fighting eight men. You're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.
If your targets make it into those tunnels,
they'll disappear like ghosts.
