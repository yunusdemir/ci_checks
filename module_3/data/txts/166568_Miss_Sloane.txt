Lobbying is about foresight.
About anticipating
your opponent's moves
and devising countermeasures.
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,
and plays her trump card
just after they play theirs.
You better not be saying that
when you're in there.
It's about making sure
you surprise them,
and they don't surprise you.
I'm gonna ask you again.
<i>Miss Sloane, could you please</i>
<i>describe the nature
of your work?</i>
<i>On the advice of counsel,</i>
<i>I respectfully decline
to answer your question,</i>
<i>based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment</i>
<i>to the United States
Constitution.</i>
<i>Those words,</i>
when you're not taking the
oath or confirming details,
those words, in that order,
are all you're gonna say.
"On average, would you say
you bribed public officials
"more or less
than once a month?"
Upon the advice of counsel...
Can I deviate slightly?
"On the advice of counsel"?
On the advice
- "of my attorney"?
- You do not...
Okay, okay, I understand
that last one's
too adventurous for you.
<i>This would be a whole lot easier</i>
if I could just shout "Fifth."
They want you behind bars.
<i>You make one statement,</i>
<i>you correct one
nefarious allegation,</i>
that's it.
You waive your right
to the Fifth
and you're compelled
to answer everything.
<i>They're taking you
to the woodshed</i>
<i>in front of the national press.</i>
<i>They're gonna rile you so bad</i>
<i>they'd make Gandhi wanna
cut their tongues out.</i>
"Did you arrange for
benefits such as travel,
<i>"luxury accommodations,</i>
<i>"and sports tickets
to be furnished</i>
<i>"to members of Congress</i>
<i>"at the behest
of your clients?"</i>
"Did you arrange for benefits
such as travel,
"luxury accommodations,
and sports tickets to..."
Daniel. When I take the stand,
you'll see nothing
but a granite wall.
Good.
Miss Sloane!
Nothing to say, guys, thank you.
Miss Sloane, Miss Sloane!
This is tight.
You'd think they would choose
a more appropriate venue.
Well, turns out the Nationals
had a home game.
Good morning.
I am Senator Ronald Sperling,
Chair of this Hearing.
Miss Sloane...
Please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
under pains and penalties
of perjury?
- I do.
- Please, sit.
Will the witness please
state her full name
for the record?
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.
Louder, please.
Madeline Elizabeth Sloane.
And could
the witness please confirm
that these details
are accurate...
Uh...
Date of birth, July 26, 1976,
address...
Suite 504, Watergate South,
700 New Hampshire Avenue
North West, Washington D.C.?
Correct.
You were employed by Cole,
Kravitz and Waterman LLP
for a 10-year period
between 2006 and 2016,
before moving on earlier...
Eleven year period.
Excuse me?
There are 11 years
between 2006 and 2016.
What was the nature of your work
with Cole, Kravitz
and Waterman LLP?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment
to the United States
Constitution.
Did you,
October 12th of last year,
accept as a client
the government
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia,
for the purpose of
campaigning against
the levy of additional
Federal duties
on the importation of palm oil
into the United States?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment
to the United States
Constitution.
Today is a landmark day,
you know why?
Because I'm free.
Name one thing you can do today
that you couldn't have
done yesterday.
Quit my job.
You could've
done that yesterday,
but it would've been stupid.
- I can quit today and...
- It'd still be stupid.
You clear your college debt
and celebrate by
enrolling in post-grad?
Academia's more my scene.
You didn't follow me
into the crapper
to gloat about freedom, Jane.
Talk to me about
the Nutella Tax.
Uh, we're really calling it
the "Nutella Tax"?
Palm oil is a key ingredient
in Nutella.
If the Federal Government
taxes it at 300%,
it'll cost more for us
to gorge ourselves on it.
Isn't palm oil in
pretty much everything?
We could have called it
the Soap Tax,
but the public cares
more about Nutella
than they do soap.
Anyway, we get
four more senators
to come out against the bill,
we can lean on Jacobs
to withdraw it.
What are you gonna do?
Tell the Indonesians they're
going to host Senator Jacobs
on a field trip to
one of their plantations.
You never washed your hands.
He'll take the wife and kids
on a tropical vacation.
Come back hailing
their conservation efforts.
His bill dies a quiet death.
If the Indonesian
government pays for it,
it's illegal.
If they use a non-profit LLP
to sponsor the travel,
it's perfectly legal.
As long as the trip
is for educational purposes.
But, the Indonesian government
is still paying for it.
See, this is why I'm thinking
about post-grad.
Jane, we go to school to
prepare us for the real world.
I'm not sure
I like the real world.
So you want to bury
your head in Socrates?
You know that Socrates
never actually wrote anything.
That's beside the point.
If you don't like it,
you change it.
- That's why you're here.
- Miss Sloane!
They're ready for you
in the conference room.
Hey, Spencer, did you know
that Americans care more
about Nutella than
they do about soap?
Uh, okay.
See that?
No reaction.
Okay, guys, we
gotta be quick this morning,
I've got a meeting to get to.
How many are they
expecting at the IMF rally?
Between 500 and 1,000.
There's a margin of 100%?
Does that technically mean
that nobody might show up?
Five hundred's the minimum,
the rest depends on weather.
Seems more people hate
banks when the sun's out.
- What's the weather forecast?
- Liz?
Time we sold Jacobs
on Indonesia.
I know.
- When Henry falls we've got...
- Critical mass, I'm aware.
Get a non-profit
to sponsor a vacation.
They give him face
and he'll pull it.
Did you just come from
the ladies' room?
Uh, I have no idea
what you're talking about.
We're talking about
numbers at the IMF rally.
All right, Alex,
put Metro Talent on notice,
- we may need reinforcements.
- I'm on it.
We're really gonna
use movie extras?
The guy shouting about
corporate greed
becomes a lot less
credible standing next
to a hobo from central casting,
with a banner that reads,
"Abolish money."
"Shit is fucked up
"and bullshit."
Best banner at Occupy.
Tell me that was one of ours.
Oh, no, that was creative
way beyond my capabilities.
- Franklin! Shmallow Cakes?
- Uh, yeah!
Does sales tax apply
to cakes and cookies,
or only to one of those?
I don't know.
You don't know?
All right, everybody, listen up!
I'm going to tell you a story.
Please, no.
A priest is giving a young nun
a lift home from church one day,
and as he's shifting gears,
he rests his hand
on the nun's knee.
This is offensive
and inappropriate.
The young nun looks up
at the priest and says,
"Father, remember Luke 14:10."
The priest withdraws his hand,
embarrassed.
Next time they stop at a light,
he places his hand a little
higher up on her thigh,
again the nun says,
"Remember Luke 14:10, Father."
The priest apologizes.
"The flesh is weak," he says.
So he drops her off,
and when he gets home,
he reaches for his bible
and he flips to Luke 14:10.
Anyone know what it says? Hmm?
What does it say, Pat?
"Friend, come up higher,
then shalt thou have glory!"
Know your subject, people!
Failure to do so may result
in the loss of
a golden opportunity.
When I see you this afternoon,
you'd better be ready to recite
that tax code in Esperanto.
I'm... I'm told I should
offer her my hand, huh?
How do you mean?
Well, when we meet,
I'm told that
she doesn't care for
all that kissy-kissy stuff
that most women do these days.
You two have never met?
Well, we've been to several
of the same functions, yeah,
but we've never been introduced.
In a town this small,
how does that happen?
So, should I offer my hand?
I wouldn't worry about it.
- Liz?
- Good morning!
Bill Sandford.
I'm amazed it's taken this long.
Well, you know, I wanted
to introduce myself
at the Free Enterprise Dinner,
but you were the first one
out the door.
Minor crisis on the Hill.
Well, a lesser commander
would've left that to a soldier,
which is the reason I'm here.
Why exactly are you here?
Killing bills
like Heaton-Harris,
that's food and drink
to you guys.
- So you've read it?
- No, but I know what it is.
It's a bipartisan gun bill
requiring universal
background checks.
On all sales of firearms.
Now, come on.
A father and his son,
lifelong friends.
It just means longer delays.
It's some kind of
Big Brother type criminal
and mental health database.
An unconstitutional fetter
on the Second Amendment
which, as you said,
we will eat for breakfast.
Mr. Sandford, I deal
primarily in taxation
and Federal Government
interference
in free enterprise. This...
I'm aware, I am aware.
But I'll tell you,
the reputation you have
garnered for yourself,
we were just looking for
an excuse to engage you.
Okay. Let's have it.
Women.
Our polling data is telling us
that we're not connecting
with the female voter.
So, we want to change
the narrative.
From mothers losing
their kids to guns,
to mothers protecting
their kids with guns.
From a battered wife
threatened by a bullet,
to fending off her
violent husband with a .38.
Guns as tools
of female empowerment.
What's the saying?
God created humans...
Samuel Colt made them equal.
Now, Liz, imagine
a new organization,
pitched at women
who are deterred
by the strong rhetoric of the
Second Amendment groups,
and by our association
with the political right.
But no links to us, no baggage.
No overt position on guns.
And you
will build it up,
you will drive its agenda,
and slowly but surely,
you will turn those members
into paid-up guardians
of the Second Amendment.
So, what? Um...
Mothers For A Safer America...
Achieved by making sure
every last citizen is
armed to the teeth?
Liz?
Jesus, is this the reputation
I've garnered?
Gold medalist in ethical limbo?
I see no ethical problem
with reframing an issue.
Trying to win the female vote
by taking the gun lobby
and dressing it up
in a frilly pink frock,
it is so crude,
it could only have originated
in a room full of old men.
Well, it didn't!
This is my own idea.
Well, my advice
is to kill it in Heaton.
You'll need more
than the trite wisdom
that we value security
to get us behind your views
on the Second Amendment.
Well, the fact remains
that when it comes
to the female voter,
our numbers need to be better.
I see.
Well, why don't I take
a look at the numbers
and then we'll proceed
from there?
Who the hell
does she think she is?
It can be spun.
For the purpose of
gaining trust,
it Heaton been
the right tactical move.
And do you believe,
for one nanosecond,
that was at the forefront
of her mind
when she told him
to take his business
and shove it up his gun barrel?
Candice!
I want Sloane in my office now!
She's good, isn't she?
You'll look at the numbers?
I'm sure the president
of one of the most powerful
groups on the Hill
will be honored that Her Majesty
has agreed to look
at the fucking numbers!
What's going on with you?
The current system
is so porous, it floats.
I don't remember
you caring, ever,
one way or another about guns!
My position solidified somewhere
between Columbine
and Charleston.
Come on, George,
any head-case,
felon or terrorist can
buy an assault rifle
from a gun show, the Internet,
or his buddy
at the Bowl-O-Rama
without so much as an ID.
Heaton-Harris
puts a stop to that.
Christ, Liz,
this is the gun lobby.
Do you have any idea
how long I've been trying
to reel them in?
No.
Something happened.
Someone you know
was the victim of a gun crime.
Nonsense.
I just formed an opinion.
You're the champion
of the free market.
You abhor frivolous
government intervention...
I would hardly categorize
responsible gun laws
as frivolous...
Indonesians!
For Christ's sake,
you rep Indonesians!
To stop our government
from looting
one of their
few sources of income.
And what is wrong
with Indonesia?
We're about to secure Al Jacobs
with a field trip there.
Is that a promise or a threat?
I can just picture
the good Senator
being boiled in a cauldron
with all these natives
dancing around him.
Get back to
your Fortune 500 clients.
Your colorful interventions
are the cause of
a lot of industry backchat
this firm could do without.
I work on behalf of
causes I believe in.
That's how I sleep at night.
You don't sleep at night.
You sit and obsess
about winning,
no matter the cause.
Those little pills in your purse
are not the kind that
lull you to sleep.
The only reason you
and your team of gum-chewing
ragamuffins are here
is that your arrogant pranks
might generate enough buzz
to attract clients
like Bill Sandford.
Meaning, if you don't dedicate
yourself to his cause,
this firm won't have
any use for you.
Now go away,
look into those numbers,
and start getting
women into guns.
<i>- Any dizziness? Nausea?
- No.</i>
<i>That's what you always say.</i>
Doctor, I'm fine.
If my insurance company
weren't such sticklers,
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.
<i>What time are you
getting to sleep?</i>
I sleep a lot, it varies.
<i>What time did you get to
sleep last night?</i>
<i>Did you get any sleep at all?</i>
These are busy times.
<i>You don't need
a doctor to tell you</i>
<i>that you're working yourself
into an early grave.</i>
<i>The long hours...</i>
Okay, when you
called me just now,
what number did you dial?
<i>Your home number.</i>
<i>Cell is off,
cocoa is on the stove,</i>
<i>book is at my bedside.</i>
<i>I'll be asleep
in under two hours.</i>
<i>Thanks for calling, Doctor.</i>
In the Republican party,
he can help you out
in California...
Okay!
Good, welcome.
Yes! Yeah.
I want you to meet
Senator Davidson.
Yes. I appreciate you coming
to every fundraiser.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Hello! I expect to
see you next time.
Yes. That would be great.
<i>Yes, nice to see you.</i>
Early night?
If you're looking for a quote,
you're wasting your time.
I've just watched you
extricate yourself
from three conversations
to use the ladies' room
in the space of 30 minutes.
You busted me.
I'm incontinent. Write it up.
I hope I'm wrong,
but one might think
you're sick of this town.
You from the <i>Post?</i>
How did you get in?
I'd just like five minutes
of your time.
Fine.
Walk to my car is three,
get to the point.
The word on the Hill
is that the gun lobby
approached you
over Heaton-Harris
and you refused.
I don't comment on
"word on the Hill."
I know the only way
you'd do that
is if you support the bill.
That's quite a story.
Turning down
a prized client because
you can't accept
what they stand for.
Elizabeth Sloane, the
conviction lobbyist. Who knew?
I said, get to the point.
Will you admit
the present system is broken?
I remain committed
to the Second Amendment.
Dildos are illegal in Texas,
but Joe Public can
walk into a sports store
and walk out with a shotgun.
That would explain the low rate
of dildo-related
murders in Texas.
Okay, it wasn't that funny.
What do you want?
Your quote.
Fine. A conviction lobbyist
need only believe
in their ability to win.
That's a keeper.
One more thing, off the record.
- Mmm-hmm.
- What do you know about
- the gun lobby's opponents?
- The Brady Campaign?
I know they're going to lose
because their total budget
is less than what
the gun lobby pays
to get their shoes shined.
What about their lobbyists,
Peterson Wyatt?
They're a boutique bipartisan
Government Affairs agency.
"Boutique" is a euphemism
for "little fish."
"Bipartisan" denotes
a bunch of hippies in suits.
Do you know anything
about their CEO?
Guy named Schmidt?
No, never heard of him.
But if the firm is built
in his image,
I'm sure he's a simpering wuss
with a Ph.D in
style-over-substance.
Got it.
I never introduced myself,
by the way.
My name's Rodolfo Schmidt,
CEO of Peterson Wyatt.
What's the matter?
Am I not simpering hard enough?
Your firm's 12 years old,
I'd think your name
would be Peterson or...
What...
What is this about?
You're pro-Heaton-Harris.
It's an open secret
you're at war with
your firm's leadership.
The Brady Campaign wants you
to lead the fight
to pass the bill.
You'd run defense
out of our office.
When it's over,
you can choose from
any of the D.C. behemoths
lining up for your signature.
This is Peterson Wyatt's quote
for your services.
I don't know
if I should be flattered
or insulted, Mr. Schmidt,
but you clearly have
the wrong opinion of me.
I think my opinion
of you is right on.
Don't tell me you don't want
to take a swing at this.
Goodbye, Mr. Schmidt.
Where's your car?
Should be at the valet by now.
I don't drive.
Hi, Jane?
Yeah, I know what time it is.
<i>Listen...</i>
<i>If, uh, Socrates never
wrote anything,</i>
how is it anyone's
ever heard of him?
Look, we need a meeting.
Where are they putting
Senator Jacobs?
The Lombok Lodge?
Yes.
- It's on the beach?
- Yes.
Good.
This goes off to
the Senate Ethics Committee.
Once they authorize the travel,
Jacobs is on a plane.
- Is that okay?
- It's fine.
- Technically, I mean?
- Don't worry about it.
It's just... As lobbyists,
we can't be involved
in arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.
I read ethics regs when
I want to look busy.
If you weren't just
pretending to be busy,
you'd know that the workaround
is to get this
to the non-profit,
have them sign and file
with the Ethics Committee.
Do I seem unduly concerned?
Okay.
George told me
what happened with Sandford.
- Mmm.
- Are you retarded?
Why are you eating
a chocolate cake for breakfast?
- Have you no shame?
- It's a muffin.
You never had
a muffin for breakfast?
A muffin, let's see.
Eggs, milk, flour, sugar,
cocoa powder, chocolate.
That sounds exactly like
a cake, but of course,
no civilized person
would ever eat
a chocolate cake for breakfast.
You've lost your mind.
Franklin, are you getting this?
'Cause I'm really
talking to you.
Huh?
Shmallow Cakes
aren't really cakes.
They're marshmallow
paste sandwiched
between two cookies
covered in chocolate.
And while our tax code
deems cakes
luxury items
and hits them harder,
cookies are obviously
necessities,
and therefore exempt.
- Are you getting this?
- What?
Have Shmallow Cakes
re-designated as cookies,
argue cake in the name
is merely marketing puff.
You'll need evidence in court,
but get a team
of scientists to opine
that they are in fact 80%
cookie and zero percent cake.
That's how you win.
You knew that all along?
You would have
got there eventually.
Then why are you
telling me this?
In case you're not
coming with me.
What's going on?
All right, everyone.
I called you here
to announce that,
effective immediately,
I am leaving Cole Kravitz
and starting work
as lead consultant
for the Brady Campaign
at Peterson Wyatt.
I've secured positions
for everyone in this room
without change to
your current compensation.
So, who's with me on this?
I just spent the last hour
wiping your shit
off Bill Sandford's shoes,
assuring him that
you're the right lady
to broaden his membership!
We're inches from
a green fucking light!
So, you're saying I should
put you down as a maybe?
You can't possibly win this!
Who's with me?
I'm with you.
Whoa, whoa, Ross,
hey, come on, I need you.
She needs me more.
Alex?
Lauren?
The fuck is this?
<i>Jerry</i> Maguire?
<i>You've seen Jerry Maguire?</i>
Guns frighten me.
So, Sloane and Co.
Versus Connors and who else?
Mmm. O'Hara, Wickman,
Moore, the God Squad.
Ramirez,
how many Tec-9s
do you own again?
Enough to defend my property.
Plus two more
to piss off the lefties.
All right, Jane,
contact Rodolfo Schmidt
at Peterson Wyatt,
and tell him there's
a total of six coming over.
I count five.
Mathematician you are not.
Who said I was coming?
I did. Call Rodolfo.
What if I'm staying?
Jesus, now is not
the time to develop
a sense of humor, Jane.
That's good, 'cause I'm not.
Seriously, kid, go.
I could care less.
You were right before.
About post-grad.
Maybe it is a cop-out.
I'm at one of the best firms
in the city.
Your reputation
might survive a move
to some third-tier outfit
to fight a losing battle.
Mine won't.
No shit.
I take it back.
I've learned a lot from you
these last couple years, Liz.
I'll miss you.
The 3:00 a.m. wake-up calls?
Not so much.
You've obviously learned
more than you let on.
You've shown more ambition
in the last 60 seconds
than I've seen
in the prior two years,
but you are delusional
if you think you can
survive without me.
If we butt heads on this,
don't think I'll show you
any compassion.
And with that in mind,
I will give you a final
opportunity to reconsider.
All right. I'm off to say my goodbye
to the money-man.
When this town guts you
like a trout
and chokes you
with your own entrails,
don't come sniveling to me.
<i>We'll come back</i>
to the Asian Republic
of Indonesia later,
but, you see, what troubles me
is the amount
of influence you had.
We've seen communications
from senior figures
in Washington
who feared that you, a lobbyist,
could destroy their careers
with a snap of your fingers.
Is this reputation something
you've cultivated, Miss Sloane?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment
to the United States
Constitution.
You see, it's bad enough
one person
having that much influence,
but if they're out of control,
if she has a problem,
an addiction, well,
it would be like the ship
of American politics
is being steered by a drunk.
Do you, or have you ever had,
any problems with
substance abuse?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment
to the United States
Constitution.
I understand you have difficulty sleeping?
We subpoenaed medical records.
You're a long-time sufferer
from chronic insomnia.
You regularly work
over 16 hours a day.
But you can't get off
to sleep. ls this accurate?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I respectfully...
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights under
the Fifth Amendment
of the United States...
To the Constitution.
Whatever.
You were prescribed
multiple courses
of benzodiazepines,
but according to the deposition
of one of our witnesses,
you've been procuring,
off-prescription,
a course of psycho-stimulants,
with the aim of keeping you
awake a little longer.
Is this true?
Miss Sloane?
Upon the advice of counsel,
I must respectfully decline
to answer your question,
based on my rights
under the Fifth Amendment
to the United States
Constitution.
Okay. Getting back
to this business
of the Asian Republic
of Indonesia...
I am not a drug addict,
and this line of questioning
has no revel...
Relevance in this case.
My medication doesn't
affect my judgment
any more than a double espresso.
And speaking of intoxication,
I can recite from memory
a list of upstanding,
elected Senators
<i>who voted on legislation
while severely inebriated.</i>
<i>And just so you know,
I think, by now,</i>
we are fully aware,
and in no danger of forgetting,
that Indonesia is a republic,
which happens to be situated
on the continent of Asia.
<i>Miss</i> Sloane.
Welcome to the party.
Five years.
Was it really worth it?
- Five years minimum.
- What's five years?
All for some puerile quip
about Indonesia being in Asia.
Can't you see that whole
construct was designed to...
And it worked.
Are you gonna tell me
what five years is?
You fell for it.
The smartest operative
on the Hill
Just got played
by Grampa Simpson!
Is it how long
this conversation's
gonna feel like?
It's the going rate for
perjury before Congress.
Now you've thrown out the Fifth,
anyone who wants you
in the ground,
and that's a lot of people,
they're hard at work
dedicating their creative
and intellectual efforts
to catching you in a lie.
Well, what if I just
stay silent?
Well, that's a great idea.
Shit, why didn't your lawyer
think of that?
If I refuse to answer...
They'll throw you in jail
- for contempt of Congress!
- Shh!
You've just blown
this thing wide open!
Calm down, Daniel.
You're starting
to look like you care.
No.
I don't care about you
any further than
I can throw you.
I work for the one ethical
lobbying practice on the Hill,
and I wind up defending
the poster child
for the most morally bankrupt
profession since faith healing.
Your car's downstairs.
Go home, stare at the ceiling,
get ready to be crucified.
I know I don't have
the most stellar record
in heeding your advice...
Don't perjure yourself!
Too bad things didn't
pan out with Elizabeth.
Oh, we have other options.
What the hell is
"Amish chicken"?
A marketing exercise?
No, we'll just try and find
ourselves another lobbyist.
I was talking about
the Amish chicken.
Oh.
She's your enemy now.
I invited you here
because nobody
is better placed
to neutralize her than us.
We worked together for years.
We know exactly
how she operates.
Oh, that is just a regular bird
raised in Amish country,
by the way.
Ah.
It tastes better because
it can't use Google, huh?
Look, there's over
five million of us.
And we're armed.
We've beaten
this kind of bill before,
we'll beat it again.
They'll make a lot of noise,
they'll wave their banners,
but in the end
it's so predictable.
She's not predictable.
She aims to surprise.
She'll share things
with her team,
but she won't share everything.
She'll have a plan
for certain people,
but they won't know
until they're dropped
right into the middle of it.
There's always something
else going on with her.
It's just how she works.
We have a good idea
which Senators she'll go for
and we can get in first.
And they're vulnerable
on other members
they're already counting on.
Badgley, Michigan.
He can bring maybe six votes.
We get to him, it's a quick win.
All right.
Show me some Badgley.
- Filet mignon, rare.
- Same, well done.
Well done too.
The Arctic char.
Amish chicken salad, please.
Excuse me.
That kind of insight is
exactly why you're here.
I'm sorry, who closed him again?
Who the hell are you?
Evening, ma'am.
What happened to
the usual guy? Mark.
If that's his real name.
Mark's moved on.
Call me Forde.
Is that your real name?
Is to you.
- How about you, gorgeous?
- Oh, God.
You a politico, or one of
these corporate-types?
What brings a fine lady
like you to room 904?
Not the conversation.
How much you had to drink?
Well, a free minibar,
I'd say not nearly enough.
You're not allowed
to smoke in here.
You're not allowed
to buy company in here,
yet here you are.
Smoke is detectable.
It could draw attention.
It is unprofessional.
Okay.
Corporate-type. Lawyer, maybe.
If we're going to proceed,
I require
a certain standard of...
Agency rules, lady.
Payment in cash,
I'm the only one
to know this little party
here ever happened.
And that's with half a minibar
down my gullet.
I understand if you were
looking for something else.
You'll do fine.
Let's get to the point.
All right.
Hey, I hope you guys don't
feel like you're slumming.
I thought it'd be weirder.
Bean bags, couple swings, maybe.
At least tell me you guys
have shower rooms.
Cole Kravitz had shower rooms?
Clients felt like
they needed one
after 30 minutes with him.
We had all the facilities,
and no time to use them.
This'll do fine.
The vending machine
downstairs is weird.
Wouldn't give me my beverage
until I told it my gender
and age range.
The vending machine
company sells
our personal details
to Big Advertising.
I already posted a complaint.
It's okay, I just lied.
You told it you were
an adult male?
Why are you so horrible to him?
Jacobs just pulled
the Nutella Tax.
- When did that happen?
- I just got it.
The tax on palm oil?
You're the ones who killed it?
Dead with the dodo.
Along with how many
other unique species
in the Indonesian rainforest?
Not your greatest analogy there.
I guess it should be up to them,
I mean, it is, after all,
their country.
Do you know how much pollution
their slashing and burning
pumps into the atmosphere?
Less than 0.2% of global
greenhouse emissions.
- So, are the rumors true?
- Yes.
Ross is really a woman.
Is Sloane the personification
of an ice cube?
She pees standing up.
And, like...
I don't even do that.
Do you think before you speak?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
I was thinking, perhaps,
we go around the table,
introduce ourselves.
Let's spare ourselves
the tedium.
If you want to break the ice,
do it with insight.
We're all here to ensure
safe passage
of the Heaton-Harris Bill
into Federal law.
How do we do it?
Realistically, we don't.
We fight as hard as we can,
build a strong base of support,
so we have a better chance
when they introduce
next year's Heaton-Harris,
or the one after that.
I didn't just move across town
with the aim of losing
as slowly as possible.
Name and seniority?
Esme Manucharian, nine years.
Manucharian,
I've heard that name.
Esme's our authority
on gun control.
When it comes
to facts and figures,
she has no equal.
You led the fight to preserve
the concealed carry ban
in Illinois.
Ultimately unsuccessfully,
but, yes.
Okay, Esme.
Why are we going to lose?
For every dollar Brady spends
on campaign contributions,
you know how much
the gun lobby spends?
- Thirty-eight.
- Thirty-eight.
So, politicians bow
to money. But, why?
It's not going into their
pocket, that'd be bribery.
Like what the Indonesians
just did to Senator Jacobs?
That was legal bribery
for educational purposes.
But, yes.
A senator's priority
isn't representing the people,
it's keeping his ass in office.
That is so cynical.
"Cynical" is a word
used by Pollyannas
to denote an absence
of the naivety
they so keenly exhibit.
Wow. You settle in fast.
If senators only care about
protecting their position,
wouldn't that make them
slaves to public opinion?
Polling data puts
a majority of Americans
in favor of Heaton-Harris.
And that's exactly why
you keep losing.
Well, this is actually
our first crack at guns,
but I take your point.
What point?
Public opinion is overrated.
Midterm re-election rates
for senators was 82%.
Voter turnout was 36.
And I'll bet most of them were
paid-up members
of the gun lobby.
Thank you.
Our opposition has created
a base of voters,
vast and fanatical,
who go out and vote exclusively
on the issue of guns.
How do we compete with that?
We build our own base
of supporters,
who demonstrate a willingness
to get their asses into booths
and vote against guns.
What's the best indicator
of voter intention?
- Money!
- Finance!
That's our first prong.
Grassroots action
aimed squarely at
soliciting donations.
Not names on a petition,
not clicks in cyberspace.
Will they know
how much we're raising?
Non-profits have to
report on their finances.
And every Congressional staffer
watches filing day like a hawk.
While you're out there hustling,
I'll be working
influential senators
who can deliver
their colleagues' votes.
That's our second prong.
Our third is to identify
who holds sway in target states.
Employers, workers' groups.
Don't just waltz into
a senator's office
and make your case.
Find out who they trust,
who they can't afford
to piss off.
Convince that person
to make your case.
That is how we win.
Not a driver?
I can, but I don't.
Well, you got further than me,
I don't even have a license.
My bank account
and liberal conscience
won't justify my own car.
What's your excuse?
To be honest, I suck at it.
I took my test when I was 16.
Only exam I ever failed.
My instructor told me
I was reckless,
I lacked due care and attention.
Knew then and there
I had a career in politics.
You weren't
messing around in there.
Did you know someone?
Someone who was
a victim of gun violence.
No, why does everyone
assume that?
Strong opinions, maybe?
As if I can only see
the merits of an argument
when I feel the effects
personally.
There was a Congressman,
I don't remember his name,
his whole career
he was against gay rights,
only to do a complete U-turn
when his brother came out.
What a well-reasoned
basis for an opinion.
Give him a gavel,
put him in a courthouse.
Are you hungry?
You eat here every night?
Pretty much.
Place never closes.
How do you not get bored of it?
It's a necessity.
It's like asking if I get
bored of going to the toilet.
Okay, this is going to
sound alien to you,
but food takes up an inordinate
amount of space in my head.
How about guns?
In doing my due diligence,
your résumé stood out.
I noticed a lot of your work
pertains to firearms.
I'm guessing that was
a conscious decision
to steer things
in that direction.
It's an issue I feel
strongly about.
It's none of my business,
but there was a gap
in your profile.
Before Berkeley,
you attended high school
in Bloomington, Indiana,
in the late '90s.
The name of the school
isn't listed.
Who else knows about this?
Rodolfo. That's all.
You can imagine
what I'm thinking.
I'm sorry, Elizabeth,
but I earned my reputation.
It didn't come from something
that happened when
I was in high school.
Even if my views did.
Going public could even
weaken my standing.
They'll say I'm too emotional.
Anyway, the shooters
didn't even buy their guns.
Heaton-Harris
wouldn't have made
a shred of difference that day.
You fear a weakened standing
will damage your ability to effect change.
But if acknowledging it
was the difference
between winning and losing?
I'd appreciate it
if you just treated me
as one of the team.
A highly competent one,
I can tell.
We're lucky to have you.
Sixty is the magic number.
Sixty votes breaks a filibuster.
So, the gun lobby wins with 41?
They could win with fewer.
We need to hit 60.
Anything less doesn't cut it.
Fifty-nine doesn't cut it.
We need 60 senators
to show up and vote.
We don't get that,
they win, period.
As I was saying...
That by my reckoning,
the gun lobby
has 34 votes pretty much locked.
And that's this side.
I'd say we have 44 locked
over here on this side.
That leaves 22
that are still in play.
These fine ladies and
gentlemen in the middle.
Heaton-Harris, provisionally,
makes it to the floor
in 84 days.
The good news is,
if we can lock 16,
we're over the line.
I'm sorry, that's the good news?
We need 16 out of 22 votes?
That's like sitting an exam
where the passing grade is...
<i>72% .</i>
And the bad news
is that the gun lobby
is rich beyond
our wildest dreams?
There is that.
Or that it's not
a whole lot of time
to steal 16 votes from the
most powerful group in D.C.?
That, too.
What Ross is fumbling for is,
we need 16.
They only need seven.
Shit.
(ON TV and the man who <i>did this</i>
<i>robbed us of their smiles,
of their laughter.</i>
<i>And I just can't accept
that we allowed it to happen.</i>
<i>Our beautiful girls,
and we could have stopped it.</i>
<i>We could have taken the gun</i>
<i>out of his hand and my babies...</i>
Jesus Christ.
We get the idea.
Brenda and Joel Patterson.
The shooting sparked a new wave
of anti-gun sentiment
in Wisconsin.
And that was
more than a month ago.
It's not dying down.
Brenda's become
a prominent figure
in the Mothers Demand
Action movement.
Public outrage
after a gun attack
lasts maybe a week per casualty.
This whole Pattinson story
should be in the ground by now.
- Patterson.
- Huh?
Their name.
The Patterson family.
I don't give a shit if they're
the fucking Partridge Family.
This is her.
Sandford needs to know.
Our delivery must be tailored
for maximum impact.
Support for gun control is up
8% in the last two weeks.
Both Wisconsin senators
are vulnerable.
If they don't declare
for Heaton-Harris,
Kirkpatrick won't make it
through the fall,
and Wallace is toast
in two years...
Who's going to that
medical thing?
Senator Wallace.
He can deliver
two other moderates.
And sure as she was
born screaming,
she'll see that as her chance
to box them in.
No, Carlos, that's unacceptable.
The media has to be there,
that's the whole point.
It has to be digitally stored
and ready to be trotted out
should he even think
about backing down.
I'm gonna send you a photo
of Clara Thomson.
She'll be front-left,
wearing a...
Clara, what are you wearing?
One-shoulder
black crepe dress.
A one-shoulder
black crepe dress.
If we're lucky, it'll be
the only one in the room.
Thanks, Carlos.
Hey, Alex, tell me
it's feasible that a doctor
wouldn't have time for all
this social media bullshit.
Yeah, if you're pulling
15-hour shifts, I guess.
Great.
But he'd be on
Doximity probably.
The Medical version of Linkedln.
Could you not have just
stopped when I said "great"?
Good morning.
Light reading?
Do you even know
what Doximity is?
Yes, I do.
It's the study of Doximity.
Lungs are asymmetrical.
Right has three lobes, left two.
You know why?
Your heart needs
the real estate?
Bravo.
All right, everybody, listen up!
Not a problem for you,
I should imagine.
What have they got? Come on!
Arguments and rebuttals.
Let's have it, wake up!
It's the first step toward a
national register of firearms.
Scare mongering.
No one's even come close
to proposing that.
And if they did,
it would have its own day
in Congress. Next.
And it's two steps away
from confiscation.
The gun lobby's rhetoric
is based on the falsehood
that we want to take something
away from people. We don't.
We want to make it
more difficult
for dangerous people
to buy firearms.
If we can't burst this fallacy,
we may as well go home.
Esme, get me a bio
on Wendy Furniss, please?
- Sure.
- Harwood Norton's CEO?
Mmm-hmm. Second largest
employer in Virginia.
Both senators are teetering,
but if I can get her
to reach out to them...
You don't see the irony
in asking the CEO
of a defense contractor
to advocate for a ban on guns?
We're not banning anything!
Jesus, you sound like
one of them.
I'm in character.
Next!
Uh, the new rules will increase
wait times by two weeks.
Welcome to America,
where you'll wait
six months for an X-ray,
but, hey, you can buy an AR-15
in five minutes flat.
You going to be
that flippant in public?
Pussyfooting isn't memorable.
Sound bites are.
And the appropriate one
goes like this,
anyone that desperate
to get their hands on a gun
shouldn't be allowed
anywhere near one.
<i>The total number of
MRI machines in Wisconsin...</i>
<i>If the good Senator
ever finishes this speech,</i>
<i>he will open it to the floor.</i>
<i>You'll be question number three.</i>
You think he'll go for it?
He knows the media is here,
won't risk being heckled
at his own fundraiser.
Back him into a corner,
and he'll have no choice.
<i>Of an additional $2 million</i>
<i>for the purchase of
four brand-new machines</i>
<i>within the first year
of my next term.</i>
Thank you.
<i>Thank you very much.
Thank you.</i>
<i>AH right, a few more questions</i>
<i>for the Senator,
then we'll wrap up.</i>
<i>Uh, yes, the lady in white.</i>
<i>Mr. Senator, I'm Chair of
the Westfield Center...</i>
He was supposed to go to me third,
what's he doing?
Following orders.
<i>Three tables behind you,
two to the right.</i>
<i>They've been tracking us
through Wisconsin.</i>
They would have had everyone
on that list vetted.
You're blown.
What do you mean?
I mean that it's time
for plan B.
<i>And our final question
goes to Dr. Raj Amarasekara.</i>
<i>I hope
I'm pronouncing that right.</i>
<i>Of the Pulmonary
Associates of America.</i>
Thank you.
Raj Amarasekara
is a working actor
named Matthew Kantaria.
They think he's about to
ask a benign question
about the clean air initiative.
<i>It's a safe bet we'll see
three or four gunshot victims.</i>
<i>Some are kids, teenagers.</i>
<i>How do you intend to vote
on the Heaton-Harris Bill</i>
<i>when it's put before Congress?</i>
<i>Well...</i>
<i>As you have experienced, uh,</i>
<i>gun violence
is a real problem...</i>
You decoyed me?
<i>Raj Amarasekara has
personally plagiarized</i>
seven research papers,
all available online.
He even has a Doximity account.
<i>Financial burden
is the fact that</i>
<i>some of the victims
are the, um...</i>
Kids.
The young.
<i>So, I think it's,
uh, first and foremost,</i>
<i>to put our sympathies with
the families of these victims.</i>
<i>But it's true, gun violence
puts an enormous strain</i>
<i>on our healthcare system
and its work force.</i>
<i>Absolutely, yes.</i>
<i>That's why I intend to give
my whole-hearted support</i>
<i>to the Heaton-Harris Bill.</i>
And that's a wrap.
<i>Thank you.
Absolutely, thank you.</i>
<i>Who else does he bring?</i>
<i>Fascitelli and Garcia.</i>
Hey, Esme, I have a surprise
for you on Wednesday.
We're going to a new restaurant?
How about a Second Amendment
debate at NYU Law School?
Don't shout this
from the rooftops,
but I trust you
to do a better job
than anyone else on the team.
You can't make it?
<i>I'm including myself
as part of the team.</i>
I wasn't cool enough to relate
to college kids
when I was a college kid.
<i>I'll forward you the details.</i>
You again.
I called them and I
specifically asked for Mark.
And I specifically told you
he skipped town.
Well, what agency
did he move to?
How should I know?
- I ain't his parole officer.
- (TURNS OFF TV
He's in trouble?
I was kidding.
Aww, we had so much fun
the other night.
Well, you know
where the door is, lady.
Go run to your Mark.
I've got work to do tonight.
Big case?
Forde, human interaction
is an exchange.
My money for your...
Dick?
I was gonna say "skill set."
But that's the only exchange
I'm willing to make.
Now you sound like a banker.
I got to do prep anyways-
For what?
Another client, tomorrow night.
You do prep?
For functions.
Believe it or not,
not everyone hires me
for my skill set.
Half my clients just
want me on their arm.
Some just want
someone to talk to
from a different neck
of the woods,
- who ain't gonna judge them.
- That is so pathetic.
Functions are different.
The agency gave me
a list of covers.
Insurance exec, marketing guy.
Tomorrow is oil and gas.
I'll be seeing you.
I think you owe me
something more.
No, it's all there. Count it.
This covers my services.
But I just gave you
a whole lot of information
about my line of work.
On your principles
of exchange...
Oh, my God!
Okay, that was a voluntary
donation on your part.
I pay you so I can
imagine a life I chose
to forego in the pursuit
of my career.
So, why don't you
go out and get it?
It's not for me.
Not when I was in my early 20s,
and sure as hell not now.
So, "no house you call home,
"no folks you call family,"
- sort of thing, huh?
- Uh-uh.
- You ever regret that?
- Not for a second.
At least now
we're peeling a layer.
And that is all my principles
of exchange will allow.
Goodbye, Forde.
If you're a terrorist,
<i>or someone who shouldn't
be allowed on that plane,</i>
<i>which lane are you
going to walk through?</i>
<i>Yeah, well, obviously...</i>
Thursday morning.
Okay, I'll hold.
- Lauren! Boston, Thursday!
- Got it!
I deleted every vestige
of my online existence.
You didn't replace it,
leaving a Clara-sized
hole in Google,
which they flagged
in due diligence.
I did replace it.
Esme!
Clara Thomson just returned
from a 2-year stint
with Médecins Sans Frontiéres.
It was solid.
Why didn't you tell me
about Raj...
Just call him Matthew.
I checked with Finance.
Your actor wasn't
paid from our account.
You ran him out
of your own pocket.
It's good practice
to keep your circle small.
In this town,
no matter where you are,
you're never more than
two feet away from a rat.
Hey! I want you on the podium
at the ARS dinner.
Wait, that's a huge deal.
You don't think we should share
the public speaking a little?
And blow all the goodwill
you've racked up?
I'm not sure I'm comfortable
in the spotlight.
Doing all the press.
Get comfortable,
that ship has sailed.
Hey, yes. Thursday morning,
I'll be there.
Every day,
48 children or teens are shot.
That's not across
the world, folks,
that's right here in America.
We are joined right now
by a representative
from the Brady Campaign,
- Esme Manchurian.
- It's Manucharian.
<i>Knocking on doors,
making house calls?</i>
How long did it take you
to even get to this place?
Consider it a sign
of how important
it is that we get you on board.
Why?
In your long and
distinguished career,
you've done precisely
jack-shit for feminism.
Because gender
doesn't interest me.
The only thing
you're missing is a dick.
I think
your presence in the room
would be a great help
<i>as I make our case
to Senator Hofland.</i>
<i>God willing, we can help protect</i>
<i>our neighbors from the kind of tragedy
America has endured...</i>
Esme... Manchurian.
Manucharian.
<i>In this country,
nine women are shot</i>
and killed by their intimate
partners every week.
The risk of homicide
goes up 500%...
Don't hurl stats at me,
I'm not a fucking journalist.
You think I don't know all this?
Does your membership?
Because now would be
a great time to tell them.
Larsson and Parr have donated
millions of
their personal fortunes.
- Yeah.
- I can't go hat-in-hand for more.
Hey, Manchurian!
Mandel's on the brink,
I need conversational topics.
- What do you mean?
- Small talk.
<i>Idle nonsense of no import
to anything.</i>
You outsource
your social interactions?
Yeah. Interests,
hobbies... Kids!
There's no better way
to butter up a parent
than to tell him
how hot his kids are.
On it.
The last time we met,
your youngest was
knocking on the door
of the Ivy League.
- Yes.
- Logan, was it?
Christ! I can't even remember
that conversation.
Mandy Hamlyn from the American
Nurses Association
- on line three!
- Ah!
I think there are
a great many on the Hill
who have become so accustomed
to your generous support,
it wouldn't hurt to give them
a short, sharp shock.
Your donors, don't ask
for more. Ask for less.
If you feel strongly
about Heaton-Harris,
you could do worse
than to pledge to cut ties
to any senator
who doesn't come out in favor.
So, what, we're
turning the screw,
and saving money
at the same time?
<i>I don't want to
live in a society where there</i>
<i>is a new school shooting
every week!</i>
<i>That is why when put to vote,</i>
<i>I will be supporting
the Heaton-Harris Bill!</i>
It came in anonymously,
but everyone's
thinking Bloomberg.
Five hundred grand?
That's over 12% of our budget!
If you were donating that much,
why would you do it anonymously?
Obvious reason.
- What? Privacy?
- No.
It makes you look noble
when you leak your identity.
Oh, my God.
Were you born that cynical?
That is just a word to
denote the absence...
Of the naivety I so keenly
exhibit? Yeah, right.
Back on in three, people.
Since when
were you camera-shy?
What happened?
You find a wrinkle?
If it isn't
Bill Sandford's poodle.
Let me guess, on a tight leash,
sniffing at his ass
for business?
If you weren't such a joke,
we'd already have his business.
So how about this?
Give Mini-Me a day off,
and I'll give you
a shot at the title.
Live TV debate, you and me.
You must be desperate
if you're willing
to give me airtime.
I kick your bony ass
hard enough,
Bill Sandford will realize
why he came to us
in the first place.
Uh-uh. You need me strong
to make him worried.
You're not looking so strong
after a head-on with me.
All right. I'll grant you
a job interview
on national television.
You can show your master
what a big, tough dog you are.
What we're about to discuss
should only be
referred to in code
in the office and over e-mail.
My ex-employers aren't
beyond bugging and hacking.
You think our conference room
is wearing a wire?
We're gonna target
a senator from a state
we have zero right to swing.
Oh, please, God, don't say...
Alberto Gomez,
Republican, Florida.
<i>What'?</i>
I thought you were
gonna say Missouri.
Florida's preposterous.
I'm being optimistic.
Public opinion runs against
Heaton-Harris in Florida.
- Let's talk later.
- In the office?
How do I register my dissent?
By semaphore?
Alex, you're in charge
of ad banners,
you have a 2:00 at JWT.
I want two phone pitches.
Clara, Brian, Lauren,
you're one.
Cynthia, Esme, Franklin,
you're two.
Ross, get stats to both.
Come on, get to it.
What the hell are you thinking?
That you should
let me do my job.
This ain't Cole Kravitz,
damn it.
Our client's a non-profit,
not some cashed-up
conglomerate.
I'm hiding in the bushes
with my begging bowl,
waiting to leap out at anyone
who looks like money,
and you're getting ready
to set fire
to half a million dollars
on some hare-brained...
<i>I mean this James Bond
shit's endearingly wacky,</i>
but if you think you're
seriously going to get
any traction out of Florida,
you're way out.
Rodolfo, it was explicit
in your pitch to lure me here
that you held
a certain degree of trust
<i>in my ability
to run this campaign.</i>
George, it's me.
I know what I'm doing.
We need to talk about Florida.
And I don't do hare-brained.
Fucking A right.
From the way you been
kicking my ass all morning,
I'm starting to think
you invited yourself here
just to kick my ass.
I'm personally in favor
of Heaton-Harris.
I've publicly declared,
my voters are behind me.
Did you want to meet
just to kick my ass?
Look,
you're sitting on six votes.
Sandford's not a punk,
he knows the opposition's
counting on them.
He also knows
if they don't get them,
their campaign will be over.
So, what are you gonna do?
Walk into my club,
bend me over
a green baize table,
and give me the spiel
about freedom?
About how,
if the liberals get their way,
in a couple of hundred years,
the Second Amendment
will enshrine
our rights to bear
baseball bats?
No, that's the argument
you're gonna make
to your friends
in the Blue Dog Coalition
when you tell them
you're changing your position.
Bill Sandford's thinking about
backing a new candidate.
One of their own.
A real up-and-comer. Hispanic.
Got offers from
eight Ivy League schools.
Ivy League schools?
Have you seen
my approval ratings, Pat?
No, he's not running
against you.
He's running against your son.
The gun lobby wants
your support, Hank.
They know your boy's
running for Michigan.
They'll handpick an opponent.
Back him to the hilt.
I tried to talk Sandford
out of it, but...
Bullshit, Connors, you probably
put him up to it,
you motherfucker.
About those approval ratings.
You can go either way.
Quietly recant,
protect your son.
Sandford won't forget it.
You disappoint him...
He won't forget that, either.
So, how was Pittsburgh?
What are you, a Fed?
The President of the Mid-Atlantic
Association of Women
in Law Enforcement called
to say thanks for lunch.
I wasn't aware they were
part of our plan.
It wasn't JWT.
It was a 30-minute lunch.
They're not a part of our plan,
which is why it wasn't JWT.
Am I not allowed a social life?
I didn't know you had one.
As someone who has
her underlings
root for conversational topics.
I maintain
a small circle of allies.
Uh-huh. Cops and nurses?
Well, I can provide a list if
you require full disclosure.
So, grand unveiling.
- You coming?
- We got a bigger problem.
While you've been jetting
around the country for lunch,
our opponents have been
doing their job.
Hank Badgley,
Chairman of the Blue Dog,
who controls the votes of...
Six Senators, I know who
he is. He's in our pocket.
Really? That what you think?
He was on board,
but he just did a 180.
Says he wants to wait and see.
"Wait and see"
is more like a 90.
We're chasing Senators
who are in play.
We can't afford to lose
seven votes we had locked.
We won't recover.
We have him on camera
pledging support?
Absolutely.
Then we'll have to
make him feel it.
Thank you.
Alex, these banners are good.
Could you say that again
and sound a little
less surprised?
Hold on, this can't be right.
- Senator Gomez...
- We're not going to Florida.
What?
Florida's out.
But you said that
we were going to Florida
to swing Gomez...
Everyone turn to Tab 9, please.
I don't have anything at Tab 9.
Security, lock down
Cynthia Green's desk.
Secure her files
and her hard drives,
and escort her off the premises.
Your Blackberry, now.
Now!
Let's go.
He offered me partnership track.
Good luck with that.
Clear the office.
Come on, come on, come on!
Everybody out.
I'll have the place
swept for taps.
Sounds like James Bond
shit to me.
We will talk about this later.
Come on, everybody,
clear the building!
Let's go! Out! Come on!
I can't believe the whole
Gomez-Florida thing
was a ruse.
We're coming out of
left field to take Colorado
before they figure out which
hole they got screwed in.
How could she do that?
How does someone
even think like that?
Maybe in her naivety,
she figured it'd be good
for her career.
I wasn't talking about Cynthia.
Morning.
Please take a seat.
We're not saying
it can't be done.
But it's risky.
- We only get one shot.
- Hey!
Were you followed?
Evidently.
Let him in.
<i>Do you solemnly swear</i>
<i>that you will tell the truth,</i>
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
upon pains and penalties
of perjury?
I do.
<i>State your full name, please.</i>
Well, look at this.
<i>Rodolfo Vittorio Schmidt.</i>
I'm guessing this gear
ain't for tuning my '69 Chevy?
Rodolfo,
my unofficial support team.
Big Sam.
Little Sam.
During the time that you
worked alongside Miss Sloane,
did you hold any discussions
pertaining to the use
of illegal
surveillance techniques?
<i>So, how big
is your organization?</i>
Well, there are six of us,
four are out on assignment.
- And you're ex...
- NSA.
Badgley is flip-flopping.
But, quickest way
to get him in line
is to mine for sordid details,
<i>and then let him know
we're in possession of them.</i>
Mr. Schmidt,
did you?
Yes, Senator, we did.
And what means did they have
at their disposal
to carry out these
surveillance practices?
Standard 24-hour
video and audio surveillance,
cell phone and online
account hacking,
location tracking,
and, with our latest tech,
close-quarters audio,
anytime, anyplace.
You ever hear the expression
"Fly on the wall"?
Well, meet the cutting edge
in eavesdropping.
It's a cockroach.
Which can be retro-fitted
as a cybernetic
robo-roach with this.
We glue electrodes
to its antennae,
perforate the thorax,
and we can control
its movement remotely.
Don't call PETA, Schmidt.
These guys can
crawl under doors,
into crevices, bags,
completely undetected.
They can go weeks without food
and still be mobile.
And how did you react to
the possibility of all this?
I told her it was
mind-boggling, ingenious,
morally repugnant
and completely unacceptable.
Boo!
You're talking
about blackmailing
a United States Senator.
Have you any idea of the
damage if this ever came out?
No more than the damage done
if we don't get Badgley back.
Without prejudice
to the undoubtedly
stellar job that you guys do.
Our firm has certain standards
below which I'm not
prepared to stoop.
Let me out of here.
Schmidt.
Find another way.
<i>It was a rude awakening</i>
<i>for Michigan Senator,
Hank Badgley, today</i>
<i>as he was tailed from his home
to his workplace by this...</i>
What the fuck is that?
<i>Organized by gun safety
campaigners</i>
<i>in response
to what they perceive</i>
<i>as a U-turn on his support...</i>
Can you believe...
I do not fucking believe!
In the shadow of a <i>giant</i> rat.
It's on all of
the national news outlets.
How the hell
did she manage that?
She didn't. They swing
left all on their own.
It has its own Twitter feed.
Huh?
The rat.
Really, I think that
this whole rat business
is little more than an
unfortunate misunderstanding.
<i>I was one of the first
members of the senate</i>
<i>to lend my support
to Heaton-Harris.</i>
<i>I've always maintained that</i>
<i>the Bill is integral
to public safety,</i>
<i>and my support for it
is unwavering.</i>
<i>Now, I sincerely hope that</i>
<i>we can get past
all this silliness...</i>
Three more Blue Dog Senators
have press conferences
scheduled for next week.
Keep hammering the point
that we're not arguing
for confiscation.
Heaton-Harris
is about stopping...
Criminals and psychopaths.
Yeah, I'm a pro
at this now, Liz.
I'll see you in there.
So you knew there was
a leak from when?
- Sorry?
- Cynthia.
When did you start to
suspect there was a leak?
Uh, after the UAPD fundraiser.
And you had her
followed by a Pl?
How did you know it was her?
Sorry?
The leak, you had
Cynthia watched.
How did you know it was her?
I didn't.
You had us all watched?
Howdy.
Cal Sneider,
banking and actuarial.
I'm sure we've been introduced,
but your name escapes me.
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong person.
I'm pretty sure I don't.
Have a good memory for faces.
This one I wouldn't
readily forget.
Really, Mr. Sneider,
I've no idea who you think I am.
Excuse me.
Uh-huh. You know
we're not really
supposed to be having
this conversation, right?
Half of Oregon
is protected Federal parkland.
They can't develop it.
So, state budgets
come from logging revenues.
- / got it....
- Liz?
Whatever clearing your head
looks like, this isn't it.
So, loggers are
a very influential group.
Excuse me!
Can someone have her
makeup done, too, please?
I'm not a part of this!
You're a public figure
in a room full of cameras.
<i>IS that her?</i>
Liz?
Hey, we have to get
Bryan on these loggers.
We're on top of
the goddamn loggers!
Just clear your head!
One moment.
Clear your head,
like I told you.
Hello?
- Fine.
- Ms. Sloane, welcome.
Pat. Please, take a seat.
I know Friday's Filing Day
and your campaign will be over,
but if you're thinking
I'm gonna go easy,
I can't do that.
This is live TV,
so no colorful language.
Bullshit job offers to my staff,
you've plumbed new depths.
A giant inflatable rodent?
Please.
You ruined that girl's career.
All right, shut up,
the both of you. Let's go!
<i>Hello, America, I'm Jon O'Neill,</i>
<i>welcome to</i> a <i>special edition
of This</i> Week <i>In Washington.</i>
<i>Guns! More or Less?</i>
<i>There were 372
mass shootings last year,</i>
<i>64 school shootings,</i>
<i>and there are over 300
million guns in our country...</i>
You used to work with Connors?
Four years.
Foul-mouthed, unexpected,
and very effective.
If background checks
are to be of any use,
they should apply to
all gun sales, not just some.
Isn't that what Heaton-Harris
is proposing?
Precisely. The bill expands
the scope of gun regulation,
and it's yet another affront
to Americans'
Constitutional rights.
No, the bill closes
an absurd loophole
which allows people
on terrorist watch-lists
to buy guns without
any checks whatsoever.
It's an incursion
into individual liberty
by an all-powerful
government...
- What, like drivers' licenses?
- Drivers' licenses?
It's illegal to operate a car
without going through rigorous
theoretical and practical
assessments.
<i>- That's a clear constraint...
- Fugu chefs.</i>
On <i>the freedom of
individuals to drive cars,</i>
<i>- or pilots to fly planes.
- Come on. Fugu chefs.</i>
You know, in Japan,
chefs train for seven years
before they're allowed to serve
a poisonous blowfish
called fug...
Yes!
<i>What does any of this</i>
<i>have to do with
background checks?</i>
Is a fair question.
Does anyone in this room
think the government should
abolish drivers' licenses?
- That's absurd.
- Why?
They're a government incursion
into individual liberty.
We accept them because
they make sense.
The more dangerous
the machinery,
the more rigorous
the tests should be.
I think we can
extend our definition
of dangerous machinery
to semi-automatic firearms.
Except that the Second
Amendment to the Constitution
doesn't guarantee
the right to drive cars,
or operate machinery or serve
blowfish for that matter.
It guarantees the right
to keep and bear arms.
Perhaps you haven't
read it lately.
Nothing in the bill
infringes the rights of the
people to keep and bear arms.
The Second Amendment
was signed in a time
where the average
life expectancy was 38,
<i>and it was common practice
for our Founding Fathers</i>
<i>to resolve their differences
at dawn in a gunfight.</i>
<i>What may have been perfectly
sensible in those alien times</i>
<i>is wholly inadequate to solve
the problems of the present.</i>
That's not the rebuttal,
what's she doing?
<i>The United States Constitution</i>
<i>has stood the test of time.</i>
It's authored to confer
unimpeachable rights,
which don't change depending
<i>on which way the Wind's blowing.</i>
<i>It's so authored
with the specific intent</i>
of keeping at bay
the Elizabeth Sloanes
of this world,
who wanna wipe their asses
with the Constitution...
Okay, let's...
and replace it
with their own judgment,
because she knows better than
the Founding Fathers
of this great nation.
Nothing is unimpeachable,
not even the Constitution.
<i>It's ironic that the very
statement of rights</i>
<i>you're so quick to invoke</i>
is in fact an Amendment.
I may not
like it either, Elizabeth,
but it's the Second Amendment.
Comes right after freedom of
speech, religion, and press,
<i>and somewhere before
freedom from search</i>
<i>and from having to testify
against yourself.</i>
They're all sort of
bunched together.
It's called the Bill of Rights.
- How do you get around that?
- We don't need to.
<i>Supreme Court
already made it clear</i>
<i>that the right to own a gun</i>
<i>is subject to
lawful restriction.</i>
One of those
is background checks.
Universal background checks
are an infringement.
What part of
"shall not be infringed"
don't you get?
I get that that's the weakest,
most mind-numbing retort
in your impoverished arsenal.
Sort of a last refuge for those
with no real argument at all.
You're talking about
the United States Constitution.
If they could produce
a rational winning argument,
I'd gladly migrate
to their side,
but "because it says so
in the Constitution,
"the Bible, or my horoscope,"
it's not a winning argument!
It's a ripcord.
An intellectual equivalent
of a yellow,
pant-pissing wimp
cowering behind mommy's skirt.
- Why don't we bring this back.
- No, no, no. Let's not!
Why don't we ask
all the mothers out there
who lost their children
to an armed sociopath,
if they believe
in his unimpeachable
Constitutional right
to bear arms?
Why not ask the terrified girl
who locked herself
in a janitor's closet
at Bloomington High,
forced to listen
as her peers were
being massacred?
Go ahead, ask her!
Her name is Esme Manucharian.
She's standing right there!
Jesus Christ, Liz.
<i>Okay, time out!</i>
We're going to take a break,
and when we come back,
maybe these two
will stop playing
Patty Cake and
the blowfish really come off.
<i>Be right back!</i>
I won't insult your intelligence
by claiming that came out
in the heat of the moment.
How far back?
Once I started getting
used to all the media?
Okay. Day one.
Wow.
At dinner that night...
You asked me if I'd go public
if it was the difference
between victory and defeat.
What if I'd said no?
Would you still have done it?
Probably.
I was hired to win,
and I have a responsibility
to use whatever resource I have.
The press we're going to
get from this,
it's practically a dereliction
of duty not to use it.
That's it? I'm a "resource"?
Professionally, yes.
I understand you have
feelings, and a life,
but I have no duty to them.
I have a duty to the cause,
and if the two conflict,
there will only
ever be one winner.
Well, hooray for straight talk.
Okay.
Get ready, Esme.
Network wants a statement.
Re-apply your makeup.
We'll walk out arm-in-arm.
We'll be brief. No questions.
Tonight, we'll leave them
wanting more.
<i>First of all,</i>
<i>I want to make it clear
that I have dedicated my life</i>
<i>to gun safety issues because
the current system is broken.</i>
<i>That's a rational judgment.</i>
Not an emotional one.
I am a survivor
of the Bloomington High School
massacre of 1998.
For years, I sought to hide
the pain and the trauma,
for fear of having to relive it.
<i>But I've come to realize</i>
<i>that the thousands of people
affected by gun violence</i>
<i>need to stand up and be counted.</i>
<i>They need a representative</i>
<i>who can speak out
for what they have endured.</i>
Let's call Sandford.
<i>Someone who can relate
their experience...</i>
There might be life in this yet.
<i>To the public at large.</i>
You're a piece of work,
Elizabeth.
If you want to
set yourself on fire
to service your need to win,
I won't protest, but Esme?
The end is my concern.
You liberal goody-goodies
can fret over the means.
- You need me.
- The end?
It disappeared over the Hill
when you cocked your leg
and pissed all over the flag!
Comparing the United States
Constitution to a horoscope?
That's the kind of shit
the gun lobby thrives on.
Or have you realized by now
we're going to lose anyway?
This is more important
than my career,
or Esme's unease
at fighting reporters
every time she has to
take out the trash.
- You're out of control.
- We're not gonna lose.
What if I told you
this whole strategy
was a shell game?
For the benefit of the
Cynthia Greens of this firm.
What are you talking about?
Bill Sandford was right.
Women are the
gun lobby's blind spot.
A massive power base
that they don't speak to
and they can't control.
And?
Those strange excursions
on my itinerary?
Women's representative bodies,
feminist groups,
female CEOs.
I've talked as many as I could
into brow-beating
their membership
to donate to my PAC.
You have a PAC?
Bill Sandford's getting
a nasty surprise
come filing day.
How nasty are we talking?
Fifteen million from over
three million donors-nasty.
In one quarter?
Actually, less.
Unbelievable.
Why are you telling me this now?
You kept this from me all along,
and you're telling me tonight?
Oh, my God, I tell you
we're back in the game,
and all you can say is that?
You knew you were
gonna screw Esme tonight,
so you kept this from me
to blindside me
before I had a chance
to fire you.
You have unusual insight
for a "boutique" lobbyist.
You've been pulling
all the strings, all along.
Lobbying is about foresight.
You anticipate your opponent's
moves, you devise...
I am not your fucking opponent!
Were you ever normal?
As a child?
Or were the twisted
thought processes in your mind
hard-wired in the womb?
Because I'm having
a really hard time
understanding how
somebody gets to this.
Guess I'm just a piece of work.
I'll see you tomorrow.
You're Madeline
Elizabeth Sloane.
You work in government affairs
at a communications company.
Well googled.
So what was that?
At the fundraiser?
You pretended
like we're strangers.
What did you expect?
You all right?
Mmm...
The only person to call me
Madeline was my mother.
Government affairs
and communications
are just fancy words
for lobbying.
And blowfish a fancy word
for what, exactly?
Outside this room,
we're strangers.
Those were the rules
of this engagement.
We were alone...
In a public place.
I can't be associated
with you there.
At least one other person
knew who you were.
Who was she, anyway?
I never reveal
my clients. Ever.
You just, uh, pry into
their personal lives,
blowfish for the truth.
Yeah, I hear you lobbyists
ain't so good with the truth.
Says the guy
with four identities,
who sleeps with
strangers for money?
I'm just surprised by what
a natural bullshitter you are.
I grew up lying, Forde.
Didn't want to. I had to.
That's why I excel at it.
It's a skill I would've
happily traded
for a normal life.
Normal's overrated.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
But I can't.
What's wrong?
- I'm sorry.
- Forget about tonight.
Why? I do somethin'?
No, it's, um...
I'm not in
the right frame of mind.
Here.
- Easiest money you ever made.
- I didn't do anything.
Well, you showed up,
I wasted your time, so, yeah.
You know, we could just
sit and talk, and...
Take the fucking money, Forde!
Get out, please.
Suit yourself.
Neumark.
- Milner.
- Two hands here, come on.
- Carlson...
- Wade Powell, Virginia.
Hackman's come over too.
We've lost Milner, Neumark,
Carlson, Hackman.
Adamou's chief of staff said
he's softening his position.
- Alex?
<i>- I'll</i> soften his fuckin'...
Bill Sandford's on line 3.
Closing Adamou
right the fuck now.
She takes my own idea
and goes up against us with it.
<i>We did try to warn you, Bill.</i>
Fifteen million.
From three million donors.
<i>In less than a quarter.</i>
You stop her,
you stop Heaton-Harris.
We have to make it personal now.
She becomes the story.
<i>We can use our
media relationships, Bill,</i>
put her on the defensive.
I don't just want her
on the defensive.
<i>I don't just want her
off the campaign.</i>
I want her to be the reason
that people think twice
before taking on the guardians
of the Second Amendment.
I want her career.
Hey, Alex, it's me.
I just landed.
Philadelphia was as good as
what we could have hoped for.
- So how are we doing?
- That's four to go, people.
You're kidding me.
Wow, that's amazing.
All right.
<i>We're joined now
by Esme Manucharian.</i>
<i>Esme, thanks for joining us.</i>
<i>Would you say that
the gun debate is now</i>
<i>largely become a women's issue?</i>
<i>You need only
look at the numbers</i>
<i>to see that gun safety
has become</i>
a <i>deciding issue
for American women.</i>
<i>If their representative
isn't listening,</i>
<i>they'll go to the polls
and elect someone who will.</i>
What do you want?
I got 15 million to blow.
Lauren was going
through your letters.
Between the death threats and
the hate mail, she found this.
Pru Walsh
of The Sentinel is doing
a feature on
the lobbying industry.
That means you.
Well, if she wants to meet me,
why did she send a letter?
Because she doesn't really
want to meet you.
She wants to say
she reached out to you
for an interview,
but didn't hear back.
It's a takedown.
Well, the least we can do
is disappoint her.
Set it up.
I've canceled your 10:00 a.m.
You're gonna see
our in-house attorney.
I don't believe
you two have met.
You know how I feel about this.
I was against you
ever hiring her.
Because your job is not
winning lobbying fights,
your job is
to stop us from getting...
Quite independently of her
being utterly contemptible.
What the hell were you thinking?
You know, whatever it was,
I guess it seems
pretty stupid now.
Liz, meet your protection.
Daniel Posner, Head of Legal.
Liz Sloane,
contemptible liability.
And amateur lip-reader.
Whose idea were
the glass walls? Seriously?
Two <i>TV slots</i> tomorrow,
<i>then a radio thing, and
finally I'm done in Illinois.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>
Gold Stone,
waiting for them to hurry up
and invent the food pill.
That may take a while.
<i>And plotting to ensnare
our last four senators.</i>
Fifty-six down, four to go.
We're actually doing... Oh!
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry. My fault.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Here you go.
Okay.
Sorry about that.
<i>Remember that first day when
I asked how do we win,</i>
and you said
"Realistically, we don't"?
I stand by every word of that.
Excuse me?
So you're going to downplay
the 15 million?
<i>Yeah, 'cause we can't sound like</i>
we're bragging about
how much we're pulling in.
Senators link donations
to voting intention,
we can't say anything
that might stop...
You wanna take this, bitch?
Huh?
<i>Esme, you're still there?</i>
Come on.
Take it.
Esme? What the hell was that?
You been here before, right?
Esme?
Look at me!
Esme?
Except I'm gonna
do it right this time.
<i>I'm standing at the scene</i>
of last night's shooting.
We understand that the assailant
was targeting a leading figure
in the gun control movement,
and was then shot dead
by a civilian
carrying a registered,
concealed firearm.
<i>The name of the vigilante
has yet to be revealed...</i>
George?
You're watching the news?
Yeah, whole bunch of Christmases
just came early
for Bill Sandford.
I'm headed to the airport.
Get ready to spend some money.
<i>Police have confirmed his
identity as Frank McGill.</i>
McGill was a legal owner
of a registered weapon.
Heaton-Harris wouldn't have
touched him.
But it might have made it harder
for the other son of a bitch.
What do we know about him?
Where'd he get his piece?
Did he have an arsenal
stashed in his basement...
For the Second Amendment,
which guaranteed her right
to be protected
from a sick individual.
And most of all,
for Frank McGill.
Model citizen,
vigilant, responsible,
and his aim is true.
How are you doing?
You heading home?
You make a round-trip
from D.C.
to pin me in a departure lounge?
So you can
check me off your list?
I betrayed your confidence.
I set you down this path.
"Don't worry, Liz,
it's not your fault."
ls that what you wanna hear?
"How could you
possibly have known?"
You're not gonna get it.
He wanted to kill me.
I didn't know
where the line was, Esme.
I never, never know
where the line is.
Obviously,
take all the time you want.
And when you're ready,
we'd love to have you
back on the campaign.
Your own terms.
No media, you can work
behind the scenes.
If you don't want
to work with me,
I'll resign from the campaign.
If that's what you want.
Is that your move
to get me back at my desk?
You want me in front of a camera
to counter Frank McGill?
It even crossed my mind
that this was all you.
You just didn't account
for an armed civilian
right behind me.
Esme...
I'll keep fighting, Elizabeth.
Wherever I can
make a difference.
But as far as possible
away from you.
You crossed the line
when you stopped
treating people with respect.
You're smart enough
to know that.
You just don't care.
<i>Thank you,
thank you. Welcome back.</i>
Our next guest this morning is
the kind of guy
you'd want to have around
<i>when you're walking home
from work one night</i>
and some dude sticks
a gun in your face.
<i>After his military career,</i>
<i>McGill worked
as a commercial pilot...</i>
<i>Let's face it,
folks, the streets ain't safe.</i>
<i>And if it wasn't for
the courage, bravery,</i>
and damn fine aim
of our next guest,
<i>we'd be reflecting
on yet another tragedy.</i>
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome</i>
the man of the moment,
Frank McGill.
So, Frank McGill,
all-American hero.
<i>Not at all.
An ordinary guy</i>
in the right place
at the right time.
<i>TALK SHOW HOST 1 With
a 9 milli. under his belt.</i>
<i>I'm curious. The person whose
life you saved once campaigned</i>
for a ban on concealed carry.
How do you feel about that?
I respectfully disagree
with those views.
But the young lady is
entitled to her opinion
<i>and nobody should be
attacking her for that,</i>
much less holding her
at gunpoint.
<i>McGill's a gift from God.</i>
But it won't last forever.
We're looking to parlay that
into a closer examination
of Sloane.
I'm thinking of
a Congressional hearing
into her unorthodox
lobbying practices.
I'm sure we can find a senator
who may be open to the idea.
You want to talk trash
about her in the press,
that's one thing.
A Congressional hearing requires
a convincing allegation
of impropriety.
I'd give my left nut to drag
her rep through the dirt,
but you're not gonna get it.
She's a CYA specialist.
I've never met
anyone so pedantic...
Start an inquisition.
Let's see how well-covered
her ass really is.
Hi.
Pru Walsh. Thanks so much
for coming over.
This is Mike Gordon
from our legal department.
Daniel Posner from ours.
Miss Sloane,
you're at the forefront
of an industry
with a terrible reputation.
Do you think that's deserved?
The only reason this bill
wasn't passed decades ago
is because of the power
of special interests.
When a lobbyist
raises finance...
We haven't heard
from Esme Manucharian
since the attack.
Are you in contact with her?
That's a private matter.
I think what's important
to remember...
So have you
talked to her at all?
What is important to remember
here is that Frank McGill
is exactly
the kind of law-abiding,
responsible gun owner
whose rights the
Heaton-Harris Bill protects.
Do you feel any guilt
about what happened?
Why would I feel guilt?
You made Esme the face
of your campaign.
You thrust her
into the limelight
that night on the debate.
- I'm not talking about this.
- You don't have to.
Did she know
that you were going to
out her on national TV?
Did she agree to that?
Why not report that
the majority of gun owners
favor more extensive
background checks?
She probably went
her entire career
trying to keep that
a carefully guarded secret.
That the gun lobby's
fear-mongering rhetoric
is trying to paint Heaton-Harris
into something it's not.
Do you think
that your little revelation
is what made her a target?
It's clear Miss Sloane
doesn't wish to discuss
Ms. Manucharian.
What's really clear is that
your article's already written.
Don't respond to that.
That's purely speculative
on your part.
- Who's controlling you?
- Let's not do this.
Look, the fact is,
you have no way of knowing
what Ms. Walsh
intends to do...
The fact is that
you have no interest
in what Miss Sloane has to say.
- And how would you know that?
- Your Dictaphone's off.
Takedown.
It could've been worse.
I've got four
factual errors so far.
This is not good, Liz.
Dump it in the recycling.
They'll make pencils out of it.
Maybe one will find its way into
the hands of a reporter
with some integrity.
It will go away.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Funny how all these senators
are suddenly very busy.
We all know why that is.
Okay, so it's not great.
The 15 million
helped us get this far,
but it doesn't last long
when you're fighting
the richest group on the Hill.
Let's get to the point.
How does it shake out
when it comes to the vote?
We'd run them close.
But by latest projections,
we'll be between four
to seven votes short.
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.
Liz, we don't have to leave.
The West Coast is still awake.
We can connect with Oregon.
If we close those
goddamn loggers,
we could get it
to five votes tonight.
Go home and get some rest, guys.
You've done enough for today.
I'll take to the streets
and rip down those
fucking Frank McGill posters
one at a time if I have to.
Go home, sharpen your knives.
It'll still be on tomorrow.
So we keep on fighting.
That's all we can do.
As my ex-wife used to say.
I met you running
from a fundraiser.
You could be done with all this.
Why don't you quit?
And do what?
Good night.
<i>Hello?</i>
I'm surprised you picked up.
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.
<i>She'd ply Congressmen
with benefits,</i>
<i>free meals, tickets to events,
golfing weekends.</i>
<i>All paid for by our clients,
via the firm.</i>
Well, that right there's enough.
She'd make a point
of invoicing them,
though they were never
expected to pay.
The debt shows as an asset
on our balance sheet.
We can call it in
any time we want.
You were her
right hand for two years.
There's got to be something.
Why's nobody on her files?
There were a ton of us,
but the others got pulled out.
It's not like we're in danger
of finding anything.
Well, how far d'you get?
We worked backwards
from her last deal
before she jumped ship.
They said it'd
be better if we can
nail her on something recent.
- Which was?
- Shmallow Cakes.
Some tax thing.
She left halfway through.
I thought it was
the palm oil thing.
Palm oil?
Nutella Tax.
Hold on.
The Indonesians?
I don't remember seeing that.
What are you looking for?
Mr. Dupont,
she's in breach of
Senate Ethics rules.
We can prove it.
Things not looking so good
for you this cycle, Ron.
You ask me, you're gonna need
a lot more paid media.
I didn't ask you.
Now, who might just be able to
fund those coveted TV spots?
I'm committed
to Heaton-Harris,
I can't vote for it
with one hand
and choke it with the other.
Under cover of impartiality,
sure you can.
You've been a vocal critic
of lobbyists in the past.
You'll lead an inquiry
into Sloane's affairs
in response to
growing media pressure
regarding her
litany of misdeeds.
The cost of hearings
is paid from the public purse.
Ron, our clients
have identified you
as the man to pull this off.
If you decline,
I can't stop them from
blitzing you
with negative finance.
They won't stop
until they annihilate you.
You know the root
of the word "annihilate"?
It's Latin.
It means, "reduce to nothing."
That's what they're
going to do to you, Ron.
So, what? I'll be taking
a wedge from Bill Sandford
and leading the attack
on Heaton-Harris'
most visible advocate?
A 6th grader could
connect the dots.
We can create a structure
to obfuscate the source.
Your big wedge will arrive
courtesy of eight to 12 smaller entities
with no affiliation to guns.
How big a wedge we talking?
Big enough
to be the difference between
the continuation of your duties
as a United States Senator
and the reduction
of your career to nothing.
This is every hit since
the original Pru Walsh
hack-job two weeks ago.
My personal favorite is the one
about how you toppled
the head of the High School
Student Council
with a fabricated
plagiarism scandal.
I'm assuming that's not libelous
'cause I can totally see it.
That witch was insufferable.
I'm taking you off the campaign.
What?
Not you, her.
I'll be outside.
What are you talking about?
Heaton-Harris gets colder
every day you're
associated with it.
Sperling's got the hots for you.
I haven't even met him,
this is a setup.
If they're orchestrating it,
it's because they want me
off the campaign.
Right now, you're lawyering up
for a hearing.
<i>Regarding your representation</i>
<i>of the Indonesian government.</i>
Dan, are you busy?
<i>Senator Allen Jacobs,</i>
<i>the sponsor of the bill
you dubbed the Nutella Tax,</i>
was flown to Indonesia
first-class with his family,
and put up at a 5-star hotel.
Our audit puts the cost
of this trip at over $30,000.
Shortly after his return,
the bill was pulled
from consideration.
Now, why do you suppose
this happened?
I understand the trip was
for educational purposes.
I can surmise that
he learned how his bill
would have strangled
a key industry,
and confined thousands
of impoverished farmers
to destitution.
From his private beach?
No. The truth is,
your client funded this trip
as an inducement for the
senator to withdraw his bill.
- Isn't that right?
- Not at all.
My client was
the Indonesian Government.
The trip was sponsored
by the Institute of
Environmental Studies,
a 501 C-3
non-profit organization.
Travel was pre-approved
by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Has your client ever
donated to this non-profit?
I wouldn't know that.
I'm not privy
to their list of donors.
Nor had I any role
in arranging funding for this.
- No role?
- Mmm.
Of course,
you couldn't have any role
because the Senate Ethics
rules prevent lobbyists
from arranging overseas travel
for members of Congress.
Indeed.
Do you know what this is?
Perhaps we can get you a copy.
Are you familiar with that form?
Yes. It's a Private Sponsor
Certification Form.
It's a copy of the same
Private Sponsor
Certification Form
that was submitted
to the Senate Ethics Committee
to pre-authorize
Senator Jacobs' travel
to Indonesia.
Look at the handwriting
on that form, Miss Sloane.
Do you recognize
that handwriting?
Yes, I do.
Is it your handwriting?
It is.
Well, it seems
we have a problem.
Even though the form was signed
and filed by the non-profit,
you were the one
who filled it out.
This is prima evidence
that you were involved
in arranging
overseas travel for
a member of Congress.
Constituting a clear breach
of Senate Ethics rules.
Is that your trump card?
You drag me in here,
wedge an endoscope
up my posterior,
and all this time,
the only incriminating item
you have in your possession
is a filing snafu?
How about surveillance,
Miss Sloane?
Mr. Rodolfo Schmidt
has stated in deposition
that you intended to use methods
such as bugging and tapping
to entrap Senator
Hank Badgley. ls this true?
I did, for a brief moment,
intend to use such methods.
But that intention
was never acted upon.
And why was that?
Mr. Schmidt
expressly forbade it,
as he no doubt told you
in his deposition.
But you were clearly comfortable
with these methods.
Did you employ the tactics
of espionage
regularly throughout
your lobbying career?
No, I did not.
Then let me ask you this.
Have you ever authorized,
ordered,
or otherwise brought about
any kind of unlawful
surveillance on any person?
Let me remind you that perjury
before Congress
is a felony, which...
The answer is no.
I have never authorized
illegal surveillance.
This concludes my questioning
of the witness.
Thank you, Miss Sloane.
We have one further witness.
Either you just
perjured yourself,
or you're not
so sleazy after all.
The Committee
calls Mr. Robert Forde.
I wouldn't count on that.
Mr. Chairman, I don't recall
being notified
of your intention to...
We were only recently
able to locate
the witness, Mr. Posner.
Let it play.
A moment with my client, please?
What is this?
Who's Robert Forde?
Look, I can make
a public appeal...
Let it play, damn it.
They're going to get it
out there one way or another.
Mr. Forde,
please raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth,
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,
under pains and penalties
of perjury?
- I swear.
- Please sit.
Mr. Forde,
could you please describe
the nature of your work?
I got many jobs
What would you say earns you
the most income at present?
I work as an escort in D.C.
You sleep with women for money?
I meet the clients' needs.
Whatever they may be.
Sometimes, the client don't
even know what they need.
Part of my job's
to figure that out.
But, sometimes, your job entails
having intercourse for payment?
Yes, sir.
Have you ever met
Elizabeth Sloane?
Mr. Chairman, the Senate
has no business
prying into the personal
affairs of Miss Sloane.
Solicitation
is a criminal offense.
It's well within the remit
of this hearing
to establish whether Miss Sloane
has broken any laws.
Mr. Forde.
Have you ever met Miss Sloane?
Yep.
Could you identify her, please?
Sittin' right there.
What was the nature
of your relationship?
- '- a function with a client.
I tried to introduce myself,
but she bucked me off.
Mr. Forde, have you ever
entertained Miss Sloane
as a client?
No, sir.
I can produce sworn statements
from two employees
of the Carver Hotel,
to the effect that they saw
Miss Sloane in the lobby
on the same day
that you, Mr. Forde,
held a reservation there.
I ask again.
Did you entertain Miss Sloane
in any capacity, for profit?
No, sir. I did not.
Thank you,
Mr. Forde.
You're dismissed.
These proceedings
will conclude tomorrow,
when Miss Sloane is referred
to the Senate Ethics Committee
for their judgment.
I can't believe those fuckers
dragged that guy...
Ross?
How's our old friend
Heaton-Harris?
Comatose. The whole
issue's gone cold.
That is what they wanted.
We all know what
it would take to revive it.
Seriously, an earthquake.
We got closer than
we had any right to.
We'll all be there tomorrow.
Excuse me,
Miss Sloane, over here.
May I have a comment?
Good morning.
Before referring
the witness's testimony
to the Office
of Congressional Ethics,
she is entitled
to make a statement.
Miss Sloane, is there
something you'd like to say?
Mr. Chairman, my client does
not wish to make a statement.
Very well.
I will now read the referral
to the office of
Congressional Ethics...
There is something
I'd like to say, Senator.
I have been censured by
the press and by this hearing
as a parasite
on American democracy.
It's insinuated
that I led the fight
for increased gun regulation
in the interest of my career.
Sometimes we act,
not for ourselves,
but because we believe
plainly and simply
it is the right thing to do.
Miss Sloane, is this pertinent
to the discussions we...
I understand I have the right
to say what I wish, Senator.
Proceed.
I believe
the Heaton-Harris Bill
is the right thing to do.
But I also recognize
that this wasn't
what motivated me.
When I was offered a position
on the campaign,
I was in thrall
to the challenge.
My decision to accept
was based on my desire to win.
And to win bigger
than I ever had before.
It's clear that my behavior
has fallen well short
of acceptable ethical standards.
I've crossed lines
with devastating consequences
in the service of my obsession.
I've betrayed the people
closest to me.
I've endangered lives.
I deserve censure for this
far more than for
any filing irregularity.
When they consider
the Heaton-Harris Bill, I wish
that each member of Congress
would follow the example set,
not by me,
but by the group of people
that sit behind me.
Who have made great sacrifices
in the name of doing
what they believe is right.
I wish that those members
would use their votes,
not in the interest of
their political advancement,
but for what they believe
is right for their country.
But I know my wishes are wasted.
And that this will never happen.
Because our system is rotten.
It doesn't reward
honest politicians,
who vote with their conscience.
It rewards
rats
who are willing to
sell out their country
to keep their noses
in the trough.
Make no mistake.
These rats are
the real parasites
on American democracy.
I anticipated if we had
sufficient success
in lobbying for
the Heaton-Harris Bill,
there may be
an assault
against me personally,
to stall our momentum
and to damage our credibility.
Lobbying is about foresight.
About anticipating
your opponent's moves
and devising counter-measures.
I'd like to discuss my future.
This is hardly the time, cookie.
The winner plots one step
ahead of the opposition,
and plays a trump card
just after they play theirs.
Actually, it is the time.
It's about making sure
you surprise them.
The fuck is this?
And that they don't
surprise you.
My resignation.
Academia's more my scene.
When I left Cole, Kravitz,
and Waterman,
I retained an operative
of mine in their ranks.
All <i>right,</i> Jane.
<i>Contact Rodolfo Schmidt
and tell him</i>
there is a total
of six coming over.
Who says I'm coming?
<i>A plan was hatched to</i>
<i>bankroll a trumped-up hearing</i>
<i>at the behest of the gun lobby.</i>
There's got to be something.
I'm surprised you picked up.
I'm sorry, you have
the wrong number.
<i>She's in breach
of Senate Ethics rules.</i>
We can prove it.
I placed George Dupont
under surveillance
<i>until he met with
a member of Congress</i>
<i>who exhibited sufficient
moral bankruptcy</i>
<i>to collude with such a plan.</i>
And go.
That member was
Senator Ronald Michael Sperling.
Order.

<i>and choke it with the other...</i>
Get the car.
In light of these allegations,
this hearing is adjourned.
Back up, please.
Back up. Back up.
I'm surprised you showed.
I hear I'm not the only one
whose visits
you've been refusing.
You look good.
Prison's not so bad
if you don't have a penis.
We don't shank each other,
we form self-help groups.
There's a black market
in lip gloss.
Hmm.
Why this time?
They told me it was business.
Yeah. Um...
Now that the Sperling
and Dupont hearings
are on the schedule,
I'm petitioning
for an early release.
You look good, too, by the way.
Thank you.
I think we are looking
at four, maybe six months.
You instigated the whole thing.
You weaponized yourself,
brought the roof
of the US Capitol
crashing down on your head.
For what, a gun bill?
- Worked, didn't it?
- Well, congrats.
Criminals must now
endure the hassle
of procuring their guns
on the black market.
Was that really
worth your career?
Career suicide is
not so bad when you
consider the alternative
is suicide by career.
My doctor would tell you
I've served
my interest very well.
Hmm.
Thanks for coming, Daniel.
I'm curious.
Your little filing snafu?
You filled out
that form deliberately.
That was you,
throwing them a bone.
Without it, they would have
nothing to incite the hearing.
And you're under no obligation
to answer that.
And you neglected
to mention this
to any of your team because...
Five years minimum.
I'll be seeing you.
