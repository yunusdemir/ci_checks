And what did you say?
- They don't have to listen to me.
- Did you agree with them?
Yes.
Leonard, I don't think we're
out of the woods yet.
I'm not sure that this is nothing.
It's an experimental drug.
We need time to evaluate
things before...
- Bye.
- Leonard.
Leonard.
Leonard, where are you going?
For a walk.
Leonard. Leonard.
This is Dr. Sayer.
<font color="#804040">WOMAN ON PA</font>:
<i>Dorquez, please call the pharmacy.</i>
<i>Miss Dorquez, call the
pharmacy, please.</i>
- Where are you going?
- I'm going outside.
No. Patients not allowed
beyond this point.
- I'm going for a walk.
- No, no. I'm sorry.
Please, don't make
it hard on yourself.
- <font color="#804040">ORDERLY</font>: I got him. I got him.
- <font color="#804040">SAYER</font>: Leonard, stop.
- <font color="#804040">LEONARD</font>: I just wanna go for a walk.
- <font color="#804040">SAYER</font>: He's not a mental patient.
This is unnecessary. Let him go.
Please, he's not violent.
He's not violent. He is
not a mental patient.
Will you let go? You will hurt him.
Will you let go of him?
Will you stop, please?
Let go of him.
I don't understand it. He was
never any trouble before.
He was quiet and
polite and respectful.
He never demanded anything.
He was never disobedient.
Because he was
catatonic, Mrs. Lowe.
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.
I'm sorry.
I don't know who that is up there.
I don't think he knows.
You've turned Leonard
into something he's not.
It's not us that's defective, it's them.
We're not in crisis, they are.
- Yeah.
- <font color="#804040">LEONARD</font>: They are.
We've been through the worst
and survived. They haven't.
- They fear it. They fear it.
- Right.
- Because they know.
- <font color="#804040">MAN 1</font>: They know. They know.
- They know.
- <font color="#804040">MAN 2</font>: They know.
<font color="#804040">LEONARD</font>: They know, they know
because we remind them...
We remind them that
there's a problem...
There's a problem that they
don't have an answer to.
And they'll never be healers
until they realize this,
until they start to see the problem,
until they admit there is a problem.
And that the problem isn't us.
We're not the problem.
It's them. They're the problem!
- It's them!
- They're the problem.
They're the problem.
<font color="#804040">MAN 3</font>: They're the problem!
They're the problem! It's them!
They're the problem!
He's lived 30 years without
the ability to release anger.
<font color="#804040">KAUFMAN</font>: As have the others.
I think his behavior is more
natural than the others.
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia,
these are signs of normal behavior?
- Yeah, because he's in that place.
- Oh, is that it?
Yes, we wake him up and
then lock him up in a cage.
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics
up there refusing to eat.
Now, they have no idea why
they're refusing to eat.
- How long should I let that go on?
- He knows why. He wants out.
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not
the messiah of Ward 5.
He's a man in trouble.
He wasn't resurrected, he was
administered a drug by you.
A drug that's fallen short of
its miraculous reputation.
The others are fine.
They show no signs...
He's been on it longer, doctor.
Now, I sympathize with him,
I've tried to accommodate him.
But I will not let him endanger the
health of the rest of the patients.
<font color="#804040">SAYER</font>: It will help if you
wait for me out there.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Excuse me.
- <font color="#804040">MAN</font>: We can't allow it.
<font color="#804040">LEONARD</font>: He's all right.
He's all right.
How are you today?
I'm all right. How are you?
Never better.
What's the purpose
of these gentlemen?
Oh, these gentlemen protect me.
- I wish I didn't need them.
- Someone's trying to hurt you?
- Who?
- Who? Heh, heh.
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?
One never knows. Someone I
least expect, I expect.
Look at history.
Leonard, every patient on this ward
thinks there's a plot against him.
They're mistaken, they're crazy.
<font color="#808080">(LAUGHING)</font>
<font color="#804040">SAYER</font>: You've gotten worse.
The drug's not working.
All these things you're
experiencing are side effects.
They're making you behave this way.
I appreciate you coming to see
me, but I have things to do.
Leonard, Leonard, please,
look at yourself.
No, look at yourself.
I have a sickness.
Sickness took me out of the world,
and I fought to come back.
I fought for 30 years, 30
years, and I'm still fighting.
- But you have no excuse.
- Me?
- Nothing to do with me.
- You have no excuse.
You're just a scared and
lonely man with nothing.
No life, nothing.
You're the one that's asleep.
Your medicine could be taken
away. They can do that.
You could wake up in the
morning and it won't be there.
Leonard.
Get away from me!

I won't let them take the

We'll work together with it.
<font color="#804040">TYLER</font>: All we're saying is you're
taking an unnecessary risk.
He's had a reaction to the drug.
He has acquired some tics.
But he's not as concerned
with his appearance
as the affect it may have
upon the other patients.
We'll be working with his dosage.
He's aware, and he's
prepared for any effects.
But he wants the others
to be prepared as well.

When my son was born
healthy, I never asked why.
Why was I so lucky?
What did I do to deserve
this perfect child?
This perfect life?
But when he got sick,
you can bet I asked why,
I demanded to know why.
Why was this happening?
There was nothing I could do about it.
No one I could go to and say:
"Stop this. Please, stop this.
Can't you see my son is in pain?"
My son is in pain.
Please, stop this.

- He's losing.

Uh, I worked,
