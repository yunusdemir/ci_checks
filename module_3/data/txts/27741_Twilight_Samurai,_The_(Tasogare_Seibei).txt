Not that way
No, no, no!
thank you. You may go
After a long illness
my mother died...
...when I was five
she had consumption...
...so from when I can remember
I wasn't allowed near her
thus I have almost no memory
of my mother
Ito...Ito...
You poor little darling!
I am from Unasaka, in the northeast
in what is now Yamagata Prefecture
Before 1868 it was the castle town
of the Unasaka clan...
...a small fief of 70,000 koku
of rice per year
Well done, one and all
that's it for today
sakaguchi...
I've heard there's a good
drinking place in Hakkenmachi...
Oh, you mean 'Hisago'?
Feel like a drink?
A fine idea
Kawanami, will you come?
I will
Iguchi?
For a change?
Not me, thanks
We can't twist your arm?
If you'll excuse me...
twilight's not very exciting
is he
With a sick wife, two young daughters
and an aged mother in his care...
...my father was unable
to drink with his colleagues
He had to hurry home
every evening at dusk
I was told the men
he worked with...
...gave him the cruel nickname
of 'twilight seibei'

Ito...
Father!
Up you go!
Your face is dirty
Father's back!
Welcome home
Codfish stew tonight, Kayano?
Don't drop it
I'm home, Mother
How are you this evening?
Of what household are you, sir?
I am seibei lguchi of the
Unasaka Clan, Castle stores
I see...
she's getting worse. she doesn't
even know her own son!
Kayano, I've simmered
some burdock. take some
thank you. You're always
so kind to my daughters
Naota...you can go home now
Yup
Good evening
But Yazaki, can't we do something
about twilight?
His kimono's all ripped
and hardly ever takes a bath
there's this smell
when you get close to him
It just won't do!
Yes, sir. We all find it
very hard to stomach
We've asked around about
finding him a new wife...
...but no woman would want
his situation
Indeed!
He's got two young girls
a senile old mother...
...and 20 of his 50koku
gone in debt
Any woman who went to him
would have to take in work
Yes, he owes money
all over the place
I don't know how he paid for
his wife's funeral
Not even selling your sword
would pay for a funeral like that
A funeral! that's something
I have to worry about, too
My father's not going to
last much longer
Kawanami's lucky
Young parents and a pretty wife!
You'd better go easy with her
It could hurt your work
Is that why you're always
cat-napping on the job?
I am not!
Listen to him!
Kumi...
Welcome!
Isn't she gorgeous!
Kume...
Bed-time, Gran
Good night, seibei
Good night
It looks like
she remembered me
the Master said: to rule a land
of a thousand chariots---
Kayano...
that's Confucius, isn't it?
When did you start learning that?
At the end of last month
the teacher says...
...from now on even girls
will need book learning
that's good
When I was a boy I read Confucius
over and over again
Father...
If I learn to do
needlework...
...someday I can make kimonos
But what good will
book learning ever do me?
Well, it probably won't ever be
as useful as needlework
But you know...
...book learning gives you
the power...
...to think
However the world might change
if you have the power to think...
...you'll always survive somehow
that's true for boys
and for girls
All right?
Yes
Keep reading, then
tseng tzu said: Each day
in three ways---
...I ask myself---
...if I have faithfully carried out
what I undertook for another---
My mother's illness had left
my father deep in debt
As Grandmother lost her wits, all the
housework, the gathering of fuel...
...and the field work fell to him
Left with little time
to attend to himself...
...he gradually became
unkempt and grimy
As his daughter, I felt terrible
about this
Wipe off that dust!
they're coming!
His Lordship attends!
Kawanami! Quick!
Provisions'
Vital stores of food for when
the clan must fight, or the castle...
...is besieged
Next we have the salt storehouse...
Here you have your beans
green, soy and red...
We pay particular attention
to keeping them dry
Dried giant horse-radish
dried fiddleheads, miso paste...
Kusaka!
this is dried codfish...
...very important provisioning
in times of war
How much have we got?
Iguchi...
Iguchi'? You may answer
directly
By your leave. We have
760 strips...
...by weight approximately
120 kan
How long does it keep?
Between five and ten years
this here is the oldest
we have.
It was acquired
six years ago
this dried cod from Kansaki is best
It holds its taste for ten years
that strange smell I noticed
is it you?
Clan retainers must serve
as examples to the common folk
Keep yourself clean
Yes, Milord!
Carry on
Idiot!
sir, l...
I'll speak to you later
But...
Be quiet!
Iguchi!
You damn fool!
the story spread
throughout the castle
My father became
a laughingstock
My Great-Uncle came from
the main house in a foul humor
Hello!
Hello!
seibei!
It's Uncle...
I'm in for it now
Is anybody here?
What, are you all dead?!
Coming!
Kayano, make some tea
Who is it?
Great-Uncle!
Disgraceful!
You appeared before His Lordship
unbathed, smelling like dried cod
the unpleasant impression
you created...
...shames the house of lguchi
that was inexcusable
I went to senior Retainer terauchi
and apologized for you
His Lordship is a generous man
so he did not find fault
Had that been his father, though...
...this would have meant
hara-kiri!
I never dreamed
it would cause so much trouble
I beg your forgiveness
Kayano?
How old are you now?
I am ten years old
Are you working at
your lessons?
I'm learning needlework
and Confucius
A girl has no need
of the classics
All you need is
to write women's script
too much book learning
and you'll never be a bride
You can go
I am here today
on an important matter
A marriage arrangement
You need a hard-working wife
to escape the misery you are in
A village-headman acquaintance
has an unmarried daughter...
...whom he agrees
to marry to you
He knows you are poor, have two
young daughters and a senile mother
I'm sure you realize that you are
in no position to demand beauty
You need a healthy wife with
big haunches to bear children
Her face is of no concern
so I'll proceed with this
if you don't mind
With all due respect
I must differ
How?
I am not nearly as miserable
in my living as you may think
Of course, offending His Lordship
by appearing unbathed before him...
...was wrong, and I vow
never to repeat it
However...
...watching my daughters
as they grow day by day is...
...how shall I put it?
It's like watching crops ripen
or flowers grow in a field
I enjoy it very much
I'm not sure if the lady
of whom you speak...
...would understand that
Who would understand
such foolishness?!
You've always been like this...
...tormenting your poor father
with this prattling of yours!
What has your marriage
got to do with crops in a field?
then I beg leave
to speak more clearly
I ask that you not concern yourself
with questions of my marriage
You defy the main branch
of your family?!
You are welcome here
Kinu...are you well?
I am, thank you
May I ask of which household
you come?
I'm your damn brother!
take her away, seibei
she's a nuisance
Mother...
Most unseemly! What will
the neighbors think?
tie her to a post somewhere!
'Expect no more help from me!'...
...shouted my great-uncle
as he left in high dudgeon
Can you do that?
Let me see
Here...twist it
as you fit it in
Is Gran asleep?
Yes
Good
Father...
Gran was crying, you know
Uncle shouted at her
Poor Gran!
Do you like Uncle?
You don't?
I hate him
He came to talk about a new wife
for me, but I said no
I don't want to take
any help from him
You'd think we were
buying a cow!
All she needs is to be healthy
that's rude to the lady as well
Are you two lonely...
...without a mother?
I'm not lonely if you're here
Me, too
that's my girls
Do you want the toilet, Gran?
Look!
Butterbur buds!
Get lots, all right?
What's that?
A child!
the poor thing!
He's nothing but bones!
Where'd he come from?
Matsukawa, maybe
Rise to Buddha!
As children
we loved to go gathering herbs...
...by the river
in early spring
But those were times
of famine
the cold meltwater often brought
the bodies of peasants...
...dead of starvation
Aim...
Fire!
All of you, watch me
Elbows up...
Brace the right knee...
seibei! sorry to keep you
waiting
You went to Kyoto?
Yes, with the Majordomo to talk
to merchants there and in Osaka
What's Kyoto like?
I had high hopes for it
but it was horrible
I've never seen the like
of Miyako-oji Boulevard
Filthy masterless samurai from
all over the country everywhere...
...cursing and swearing
in dialects you can't understand
then someone shouts 'Divine
punishment!' and the swords come out
the Kamo River's full of headless
corpses all swollen up...
I thought it'd be geishas in Gion...
Dear me!
Prime!
Aim!
Fire!
Misfire!
Wait! What's wrong?
Ow!
Fool!
I told you to wait!
they're a bit late
the Choshu clan may have been
beaten once
but they'll be back with satsuma
they'll snuff out 250 years of
shoguns like the wind does a candle
What's our clan doing?
Our leaders aren't thinking!
How would you like
to go to Kyoto?
the Emperor's palace
is short of guards
I'll recommend you
You'll see how things are
someone like you shouldn't be
stuck in a field here right now
I'm afraid
you over-estimate me
the times are changing
When they do, I'll give up
samurai status and be a farmer
that's what I'm suited for
You're a strange one
But you always were
No ambition at all
Oh, I nearly forgot...
My condolences
on your bereavement
Burn a joss stick for her
You didn't have to...
I wanted to send my sister
to the funeral in my place...
...but she was having
some troubles of her own
I'm sorry
Miss tomoe? What's wrong?
You know she married the son
of Captain Koda...
It turns out this toyotaro
is a mean drunk.
If I'd known
I'd never have agreed
A mean drunk?
He'd hit her, kick her...
she'd come running
to my house to get away
I was worried
one day he'd kill her...
...so I got the Castle
to order them divorced
Divorced?
Just recently
so now tomoe's
back at my house
Really?
And here I thought she was the wife
of a fine 1200-koku samurai
I had no idea
I made a mistake. she's gone
through hell because of me
Well done, one and all
that's it for today
sakaguchi...
sakaguchi! Feel like
dropping in at 'Hisago'?
You want to see O-Kume!
Quiet!
You come too, Kawanami
Again?
Damn right!
I'll be going
Iguchi...
You should come see the girls
take your mind off things
I'm fine, thanks.
Iguchi...
Don't waste your breath
Look, Naota. the azaleas are out
Yup
Kayano, lto, I'm home!
No one's here...
Welcome home
It's been a long time
Uh...perhaps there's...um
You were out
when I came by...
Have you forgotten me?
I'm linuma's younger sister, tomoe
Oh, Miss tomoe!
I didn't know you
I've just seen your brother today
He told me what had happened
so you know all about it, then?
Yes
Because of that I'm back
living at his house
there's nothing for me to do
so they have me weaving
I came here to escape
You're very welcome
Let's go inside
Your sock...
Oh, yes...
It seems your father
had forgotten me!
We always played together!
Welcome home
Kayano, lto, this is Miss tomoe
We're, uh...
Childhood friends
He always used to tease me
I did not!
I got a present
Me, too
Aren't they pretty!
Mother, I'm home
Welcome home
Do you know this lady?
she's Miss tomoe
the linuma girl
see? she remembered me
that's good. And of course
you remember me, don't you?
Of which household are you?
I'm your son
You are, are you?
Hello
tane, watch the hotpot
It was as if our house was brighter
from the moment Miss tomoe arrived
I've never forgotten
It was when I was five
I always wanted to do
whatever the boys did
Once I was climbing a pine tree
and a branch broke...
...and I got hurt
Really?
Yes! Your father happened
to be there that day...
...and he carried me piggy-back
all the way to the doctor!
I think he was 12 or 13
His back was this big!
Just like a grown-up's
He made me feel so safe...
Do you remember, seibei?
I remember
something like that...
When I was nine
my mother told me...
...I couldn't play
with boys any more
I was so sad...
Being a girl's no fun, Kayano
Drip, drip drip...
...come our Chonbei's tears
Drip, drip, drip...
Let's catch his falling tears...
...and wipe them away...
Wipe them away...
Let's take his
tear-soaked kimono...
...and wash it clean...
Wash it clean...
Let's take the kimono
we've washed...
...and wring it out...
Wring it out...
Let's take the kimono
we've wrung out...
...and hang it to dry...
Hang it to dry...
You haven't changed
at all, have you
It's as if I'm
a completely different person
that's not true
You still smile
just like you used to
You don't have to console me
I know I've changed
People told me how radiant
a bride you were...
...when you went to
the Koda house
I don't want to remember
It's very late
I'll leave you here
say hello to your brother
Your beard's growing out...
It's so soft!
Iinuma! I want the truth!
that man's here!
My husband...
My ex-husband...I'd know
that drunken voice anywhere
I'm going!
Your master's leaving
Hands off!
I'm not drunk!
My sandals!
Iinuma! Where's tomoe gone?
I told you, she's at her aunt's
You're lying!
Please! Keep your voice down!
there are elderly people here!
to hell with her
Listen, linuma...
If I'm not good enough for tomoe
she's welcome to leave
But linuma...
...I've got a bone to pick
with you
You went to His Lordship
and got him to divorce us
squire Koda, I've told you
time and time again...
shut up!
You made me a joke
in front of the whole castle!
I demand satisfaction!
squire Koda!
My sword!
stop this, will you?!
tomoe...
Where've you been
till this hour of the night?
Where I go is no one's business
but mine
And I'll say this, too
I am not your wife now
It's 'Miss tomoe' to you
tomoe! Get inside!
Perhaps that's enough?
Who are you?!
I am seibei lguchi
friend to linuma
Perhaps I could accept
your challenge in his name?
But here we are in the town
And you are drunk
Let's settle this another time
when the alcohol has worn off
If you've put yourself forward
this way...
...you must know how to fight
I make no such claim
Fine. We fight tomorrow
tomorrow?
By the river behind Hannyaji
temple, at the 8th hour?
Done
Behind Hannyaji, 8th hour
see you
seibei, he's serious!
Are you?
I had no choice
He's good with a sword
It'll work out
I'll say good night
Don't tell tomoe about this
Wait!
What if you kill him?
the Clan forbids dueling
I'll think of something
Good night
Naota...
We're going
Ito!
Yu tzu said: Harmony is the
greatest beneficence of the rites
Good morning
sit down!
I'm leaving
this is no good. I'm slow
You think you can take me?
Damn right!
then get ready
He's afraid!
Hold it!
I said last night
I'd take your place!
I should do this
You're no match for him
Go over there and watch
I'm sorry I'm late, squire Koda
I will be your opponent
What's that stick?
My school of swordfighting
uses this for practice
Do you mock me?
Draw your sword!
A sword might kill
this stick will not
It will break bones at worst
I won't take this from a samurai
of your rank! I'll cut you down!
Watch for the draw-and-slash!
You can still apologize
the apology is yours to make
With a real sword, you'd be dead
Do you apologize?
Or do you continue?
splash some water on him
that'll bring him to
Come on, linuma
You're all right?
Don't tell Miss tomoe
about this
Or anyone else, either
those men will talk
No. A whipped dog
doesn't bark
Is that soy sauce? Over here
Excuse me for interrupting. I am
Zenemon Yogo, Master of the Watch
I know that
Are you the 'twilight seibei'
who thrashed toyotaro Koda...
...and left him with
a great big lump on his head?
I didn't really 'thrash' him
He asked for a match, and my
sword caught him on the head
Koda is a drinking companion
of mine
the other day...
...he came crying to me, asking
if I would take revenge for him
that's the kind of man he is
But it seems you can fight
What school are you?
Many years ago I trained
under toda-sensei
so you're a disciple
of Jinsai toda?
I merely attended his dojo
Perhaps we could
try a match one day
I'd be no match for you
I'm afraid. If you'll excuse me...
I wish I wasn't getting old
I can't read once the sun sets
First your teeth go
then it's your eyes
And how's number three?
that went long ago!
that's it for today, everyone
I'll be going
Excuse me
sir twilight's gone?
Didn't you hear?
the other day 'sir twilight' fought
the son of Captain Koda
A fight? And what happened?
Wood against steel
sir twilight went bang!
Knocked him senseless
He did?
I always thought he was strange
I never thought
he was a fighter, though
Maybe we shouldn't
be calling him 'sir twilight'
You think he knows?
sure he does
Fumi! It's raining!
It's raining!
Is the laundry in?
Yes!
Welcome home
Miss tomoe was here
she left you this letter
she's got even nicer writing
than the schoolmaster
Let me!
No!
I have finally learned what happened
from my elder brother
I must apologize
for all the trouble...
...I have caused you
I am, however, delighted
I very much want to see you
and thank you in person
today I intruded upon you and
with your daughters...
...cleaned your house
and did your laundry
Please do not scold your daughters
for allowing me in
I would like in the future
to be of what use I can.
Written in haste
to: seibei lguchi, Esq.
From: tomoe
tomoe started coming
every second day or so
the two of us looked forward
to coming home from school
We're back!
Hello!
You know what the teacher
did today? He farted out loud!
she cleaned with us
did laundry with us...
...and taught us to cook
On rainy days we'd practice
calligraphy and sewing
And she'd tell us all kinds
of stories, the like of which...
...we'd never heard before
Finished
Bring this line over
Finished!
that's good, lto!
Hey! stop it!
Ito! Write on
your own paper, all right?
No!
Don't you look nice!
How much fun it was to go off
to a festival in kimonos...
...she had made us
shoo! Go away!
samurai then were strictly
forbidden to attend the festivals...
...of the peasants
and townsfolk...
...but tomoe cared not a whit
I remember well what
she said:
It was because of the peasants
that we lived as samurai
Why are you catching them all?
We're using the same bait!
You're trying too hard
the fish sense it
Your shoulders are too stiff
It's like swordfighting
Aw, stop lecturing!
show me your rod
this hook's too big!
seibei...
...I want to talk to you
It's about tomoe
she's had a few proposals
she's beautiful and talented
there's not many like her in our clan
Any good ones?
she won't say yes
and I can't pressure her
I asked her, half in jest
if she'd like to marry you
You what?!
We may be old friends
but that isn't funny!
she didn't take it as a joke
she said she wouldn't mind...
...and turned all red
that's enough!
You're both making fun of me!
You dolt!
she was serious
stop it
Listen...
...I've already put her through hell
marrying her to Koda
If it's all right with you
I'd like to make that up to her
It's a bit sudden...
I don't need an answer now
but I will within two or three days
I might have to go to Edo
You've been really busy lately
What's going on?
You probably haven't heard
His Lordship's dead
A month ago
He is?
Why have they kept that
from us?
they're not agreed on
who's going to succeed him
the Castle Warden, Lord Hori
has asked the shogun...
...for permission to adopt
His Lordship's third boy, tadaatsu...
...and seize control himself
If that happens the clan will split
and blood will wash away blood
I might not come through this
unscathed myself
so if you could give me an answer
before I leave for Edo
All right
I'll answer you
I'm very grateful to tomoe for
all she's done for my daughters...
...all the cooking and sewing
and everything else
It's like a dream come true
However...
...having her come to my house
as my wife is something else again
she's a daughter of the linumas
a 400-koku family
she doesn't know what life is like
for a 50-koku petty samurai
Are you sure you're not
under-estimating her?
she's very much her own woman
It'd be fine at the start
But when it sunk in that 50-koku
would be her life forever...
...she'd be sorry
My late wife was
Hers was a 150-koku family
she never got used to
the fall in status
Rise in the world, she told me
or my family will grieve
she said that all the time
after she got sick
I don't want to put tomoe
through that torment
tomoe's not 15 or 16
I'm sure she'd thought about
what she said
No more
Let's forget this
Let's try up there
It's a girl!
What a stink!
Rise to Lord Buddha
Eat your fill in heaven!
Let's call it a day
From that day forward
Miss tomoe stopped coming...
...to our house
Make way!
stand aside!
turning left!
the Warden has returned!
Go!
What's that?!
It's the alarm!
stop what you're doing and listen
I have important news
from Lord Hori, Castle Warden...
...who returned
this morning from Edo
the 12th head of the Unasaka Clan
Lord tadatomo, died of measles...
...at the beginning of this month
He was 32 years old
He was a good and wise ruler
intelligent and tolerant...
...a true hero
Only last spring we had
the honor of meeting him...
...and having him speak to us
Iguchi, you haven't
forgotten that, I'm sure
What a fine and gentle man
he was!
senior retainers will
remain in the castle
the rest of you are to leave and pray
for the repose of His Lordship's soul
this could mean open war!
I doubt that...
...but Lord Hori's sure to go after
His Lordships reformers
Dispositions'?
Yes
Which side is
our Commissioner on?
the reformers
or the Hori faction?
He'll be with the mainstream
Just like me
While there were fearsome rumors
that the Castle was preparing for war...
...it didn't seem to involve
petty samurai like my father
All right?
We wanted to ask Father
why Miss tomoe no longer came...
...but for some reason
we couldn't
this was because even in
our children's hearts...
...we knew something
had happened between them
squire lguchi!
I'm sorry you've come for nothing
My husband isn't back from Edo
I expect him in a day or two
Has he written anything about
what's happening in Edo?
No
there was a letter yesterday...
...but all he talked about was what
he wants to eat when he gets home
that's good
I'm sure you know
they're handing down dispositions
some people have even been
ordered to commit suicide
I was worried about what
might have happened to linuma
I'm happy to hear he's all right
Give him my regards
when he gets home
You came just for that?
Yes
Good day
It was very kind of you
Carry on
Where's squire lguchi?
He went away
Where are you going?
squire lguchi may still be
close by
Why do you want to see him?
No reason in particular
I haven't seen him for a while
I'd like to say hello
Wait!
tomoe...
...it is unseemly for
a young woman to be seen talking...
...with some samurai on the street
And you are a returned bride
with a proposal being discussed
You shouldn't be doing that
in broad daylight with people around
I've been meaning to tell you that
for a long time now
What's wrong with a girl
talking to a samurai?
Are you questioning
your elder brother's wife?
shouldn't l?
You should not
A young women
does not question her elders
With 60 from last month
that comes to 550 mon
Could I have a receipt?
You know the bath fee went up
to seven mon last month
Prices are going up everywhere
Could you pay more
for these cages?
With things as unsettled
as they are...
...no one's buying insect cages
Could you ask your boss
for me?
Well, I'll ask
I take this work
as seriously as my duties
I understand that
If you'll excuse me
Come on
We're not thieves
We're just picking up some
insect cages from squire lguchi.
Is he doing piece-work?
Hello!
Hello!
Who is it?
Commissioner Kusaka
It's very late, I know
I'd like you to accompany me
to Lord Hori's quarters
Yes, sir
they said you don't need
full formal dress
Just a hakama skirt
so you're lguchi's girl?
How old are you?
Five
You're a sweetheart
I'm ready
Kayano...you all get to bed
Let's sleep
seibei lguchi
of the Castle stores...
that'll do
Iguchi, come over here
We called you here this late because
an awkward situation has arisen
You know there was a revolt
among our retainers in Edo?
Yes, sir
Fortunately no word of this
reached the shogun
His Lordship ordered shima Hasegawa
and his faction to commit suicide
But one of Lord Hasegawa's men
Zenemon Yogo, Master of the Watch...
...says he was merely following
the orders of his superior...
...asks why he should be punished
and refuses to commit suicide
If you want me dead
come and kill me,' he says!
And with these disgraceful words
has barricaded himself in his house
this evening we sent our Master
of Foot, Genba Hattori, against him
Zenemon Yogo! I come
at the order of the clan!
But he died himself
He's a 'one-sword' fighter
No one in the clan
is his match
We were talking about who
to send against him...
...and your name came up
Iguchi, raise your head
You're a 'short-sword' fighter
of the toda school?
It's been years
since toda-sensei taught me
I merely attended his dojo
We don't have time
for modesty
We've learned that you were
an instructor at his dojo
He must be beaten inside his house
the short sword will help there
that is another reason
we have chosen you
Kill Zenemon Yogo
by twilight tomorrow
that is an order from
the clan's senior Retainer
Kusaka...what's this man's stipend?
50 koku
20 koku bespoken
for a net of 30
that must be hard, with two young
daughters and an aged mother
Bring us the head
of Zenemon Yogo...
...and life will be easier
Do you accept?
Answer him
this is an honor
You shut up!
Well?
By your leave...
I am ashamed to say that
over many years of hardship...
...with two daughters, a sick wife
and an aged mother...
...I have lost the desire
to wield a sword
A serious fight
the killing of a man...
...requires animal ferocity and
calm disregard for one's own life
I have neither of those
within me now
Perhaps in a month...
...alone with the beasts in the hills
I could get them back
But tomorrow, I am afraid
is completely impossible
I ask that you extend
the honor of this commission...
...to another man
What complete
and utter nonsense!
We are not here for foolishness
from a petty samurai!
Your clan orders you
to kill Yogo
Do you understand that?!
the Clan's orders are
His Lordship's orders
the very thought of refusal
is an offense!
You are relieved of your post!
You are expelled from the clan!
Please, Warden...
What do you say, lguchi?
Do you accept?
Of course he does!
Don't you!
May I request
an evening or two...
...in which to give my answer?
You may not!!
You will answer now!
I obey
I accept the commission...
...to kill Zenemon Yogo
Well said!
An officer will call
at the hour of the snake
Have your preparations made
Withdraw
Iguchi...
Don't worry. Who's Zenemon
Yogo anyway?
You're sure to win
I have decided exactly that
Good
One should, however
always prepare for the worst
that's true. the worst
can always happen
In that event, Commissioner
this will be farewell
thank you for everything
you've done for me
Please convey my regards
to my colleagues in stores
I understand. And, uh...
...I'll take responsibility for
those you leave behind
I'll see they are looked after
that's a relief to hear
All the best to you
A strange noise made me
open my eyes
Looking for the sound, I saw
my father sharpening his sword
He looked so strange it was hard
to believe he was my father
I still remember clearly
how he looked that night
the Heart sutra:
the bodhisative clearly saw
the emptiness of the five states...
...thus relieving misfortune and pain
Form is only emptiness
emptiness only form---
We're going
Kayano!
the Master said: a man cunning
of word and smiling of face...
...is rarely benevolent
tseng tzu said: Each day---
Naota, do something for me
Yup
You know Miss tomoe's house
in Nishikicho, don't you?
Yup
Go there, and speak to
Miss tomoe
Now, this is important
You have to see
Miss tomoe herself
And then say...
...'I'm really very sorry, but
could you come right away?
I'll explain why
when you get here.'
All right?
I'm really very sorry...
...but could you come
right away?
I'll explain why...
Uh, I'll explain why...
I'll explain why
when you get here
When you get here
that's fine. Hurry
Look where she laid her egg!
Could you come...
I'll explain why
when you get here
Whatever's the matter
at this hour?
I'm really very sorry...
...but could you come
right away?
When you get here...uh...
He'll explain why?
squire seibei sent you
to tell me that?
All right. I'll get ready
I didn't think you'd come
the clan has ordered me
to go and fight...
...another retainer
I'm going out under orders
so I must be properly dressed...
...and I can't do my hair alone
I'm in a bind
so I asked you to come
If you can spare the time
could you help me?
When do you have to go?
the hour of the snake
there's not much time
Where's your kimono?
It's laid out over there
Naota, boil some water
Who's coming for you?
A clan officer
Naota, will you wait
out by the gate?
sit down. I'll comb your hair
May I ask why...
...you're going out to fight?
I can't refuse a clan order
Petty I may be
but I'm still a samurai
Bamboo baskets, hampers!
Bamboo baskets, hampers!
Your elder brother...
...asked if I would
take you as my wife
I refused
Did you know that?
Yes, I did
But...
But since that day...
...when I told him no...
...I've started thinking
about you
Now I think of it
ever since we were small...
...and I made dolls
to give you...
...I always dreamed one day
you'd come to me as my wife
that dream stayed with me
even after I got married...
...and you married Koda
It's never faded
I'm going out now
to fight to the death
I'm going to win
and return to this house
At that time, if I were
to ask you...
...to be my wife...
...would you accept?
A few days ago I had
a proposal...
...from a retainer in Aizu
I accepted.
I've been very rude
I should never have asked you
to come here
No
I'm happy that you asked me
I've been a fool
Please forget everything
I've said
Really? A retainer from Aizu...
that sounds like
Are they here?
Yup
Well, I'll be going
thank you very much
for everything
Um...
...I'm afraid I can't wait here
until you come back
I pray with all my heart...
...that luck is with you
and you come back safely
Naota, see Miss tomoe home
when she goes
take care of the kids
Mrs lguchi...
...how are you today?
Fine, thank you
Of which household
would you be the daughter?
Me?
I am...
...squire seibei's
childhood friend...
...tomoe
sir...
squire lguchi?
Zenemon Yogo has closed himself in
with the shutters down
that is Genba Hattori
Master of Foot
We should remove
his corpse...
...but no one can get in
take care
Zenemon Yogo is no longer human
He is a beast!
Leave to enter!
sir twilight...
so they sent you?
Zenemon Yogo...by order of
the clan, I come for your life
Draw your sword, please
Have a drink?
I know you're all keyed up
but I'm going to run
Run?
Yep
I want you let me get away
If you please
I didn't expect that from the clan's
best one-sword man
My orders are to kill you
I can't let you escape
Don't be so impatient
You can kill me any time
I'd like to talk to you
Have a seat
It's a nice day
sit down
What's going on?
they're talking
Even if you escaped
where would you go?
Over that mountain and I'm out
of the clan's domain
there are masterless samurai
everywhere
I can lose myself in them
go to Kyoto, to Edo...
If I do that for a few years...
...the world will have changed
the samurai's day is done
this isn't the time
for that talk
Pick up your sword, please
I am under orders
from the clan to...
Like hell!
You're the clan's errand boy
out to claim a reward
Have a drink
I was an errand boy, too
I served Lord shigemasa toki
twelve years ago he was ordered
to commit suicide...
...after a power struggle
within his clan
then I wandered for seven years
with my wife and daughter...
...in search of a new situation
seven?
With no income?
Of course not
I did manual labor and helped
peasants plant and harvest...
...to get a little rice
Or we'd slink into a temple
and beg alms there sometimes
three years ago the Unasaka clan
made me an official retainer...
...but by then hardship
had killed my wife
I'm good with a sword
but I'm hard to get along with...
...and I can't hold my liquor
But this time I promised myself
it'd be different
I would do my duty
as a true Unasaka retainer
I worked hard to do that
My superior was
Lord shima Hasegawa
He liked me, and did
all he could for me
to me...
...the tasks he assigned were
the tasks of the clan
His orders were the clan's orders
and I carried them out faithfully
What was wrong with that
twilight?
Why do I have to
cut open my stomach?
I haven't come here
to answer...
...that kind of question
I heard your wife died
of consumption. Is that true?
I'm surprised you know that
And her fever went up
as night came on?
Yes
Consumption is a hard disease
And it's catching
My daughter died of consumption
caught from her mother
You're not the only one
who's suffered
How old was your daughter?
sixteen
When she should have been
a bud swelling into bloom...
...she died...
...nothing but skin and bones
A sad, sad sight
I'm very sorry to hear that
Her ashes
she was a pretty girl
with pale skin
I guess Lord Hasegawa
took pity on me
He gave me money for a funeral
well above my station
If only for that...
...I'm very much in
Lord Hasegawa's debt
What's your stipend?
50 koku
A sick wife, and children
all on 50 koku?
that must be hard
Doctor and medicine alone cost
a ryo and 2 bu a month
Piece work wouldn't cover that
I borrowed from relatives
but it still wasn't enough
sometimes we didn't even have
tomorrow's rice left
I know how bad it feels to see
the bottom of your rice chest
You've had hard times, too
Where I really ran into trouble
was my wife's funeral
the family's main branch wanted
a funeral that wouldn't shame them
I couldn't afford it
I was desperate
so I finally sold my sword
It was a fine sword
I'd inherited from my father...
...but I figured
the age of the sword was over
I'm afraid this is just bamboo
You're going to kill me
with a bamboo sword?
No
I learned short-sword
from toda-sensei
I meant to fight with that
short-sword?
You mean to kill me
with some kind of cheap trick?
You're not taking me seriously
are you
Wait!
I won't have it!
I only told you that because
you wanted me to let you go!
Draw!
sir!
You're very good...
If you want to run
now's your chance
After I kill you
Draw!
sir! there's still time
to stop
Calm down and think!
You haven't rested
since yesterday
You're already breathing hard
You mock me
sir! Continue this
and I'll cut you down
Is that what you want?
that's fine by me
Draw
You've cut me, twilight
this is what you get
for taking me lightly
Have a seat
Will you let me go
twilight?
that was...
...my intention
It's dark
I can't see
Hell
twilight...
Is it over?
It's all yours
Careful!
He's dead!
Ito...
Go buy some tofu
Don't lose the money
Miss Kayano!
It's the Master!
Ito...
...I'm home
Miss tomoe! Father's back!
You're still here...
thank heaven!
I was sure...
...you were dead!
Finally Miss tomoe
became our mother
My father was happy
But peace prevailed in our house
for less than three years
With the Meiji Restoration
came civil war
Our clan supported
the former shogun...
...and fought as rebels
against the emperor's government
During this 'Boshin War'.
...my father was shot
and killed
tomoe took us, her step-daughters
to Edo, now 'tokyo'...
...and supported us
until we were both married
Now she sleeps with my father
beneath this stone
In the new Meiji era, many men
who had worked with my father...
...rose to positions
of great authority
I often heard them say...
...that 'twilight seibei
was an unlucky man.'
But I do not agree
My father had no desire
to rise in the world...
...and I don't think
he considered himself unlucky
He loved his daughters...
...and the beautiful tomoe
loved him
His life, I think
was short but full
I am proud to have had
such a father
