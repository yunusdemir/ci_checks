Is the wind blowing differently now?
Yes, a magic lamp!
Aladdin's magic lamp, which can
make anyone's wish come true!
They recently found it
in an Arabian desert.
I see...
It's a dream-like treasure that
can make any wish come true.
Lupin, could you get me that magic lamp?
Huh...
Run!
I'll get the load off of you!
Stretchy stretch!
A magic lamp?
Yeah.
If you rub it, a genie comes out,
and makes your wish come true.
Never heard of it.
You can read about it in Arabian Nights.
Oh right. You only know Otogi-zoshi.
Lupin went all the way to
Arabia for a fairy tale like that?
Fujiko probably made him do it, as always.
By the way, aren't you
gonna help me at all?
With what?
Anyway, Goemon,
if there really is a magic lamp,
it might be perfect for you.
Ask the genie to get rid of your impure
thoughts, and you'll be free of them.
What a stupid idea...
Are you saying I have impure thoughts?!
Whoa!
Goemon, setting aside your late reaction,
turning so quickly to your Zantetsu
is a sign that you need more training.
It's hard to react correctly.
Hey, where are you going?!
To the magic lamp?
I'm getting a bad feeling...
Excuse me.
Is this Dr. Jordan's office?
I'm Zenigata from Interpol.
You're quite late.
Oh well, I'll take a look.
I didn't come here for a diagnosis.
Don't worry.
Seventy-six percent of the patients
who come here say the same thing.
Now...
W-Wait!
I see!
Wait, Doctor.
I came here because...
This is...
I don't understand what you're saying.
Doctor!
You are mentally distressed.
It's quite serious.
Doctor!
We'd better treat it
soon before it's too late.
Really?
It comes from stress.
Tell me everything honestly if
you're troubled about anything.
Right...
There's this horrible thief named Lupin
who's been troubling me for years.
Lupin?
We received information that he's
coming here tonight to steal a lamp.
A lamp?
Yes. I heard it's an old but valuable item.
It was unearthed from the
site while building this tower,
so for now it's been put in storage here.
I've placed a large number of
guards around this building,
preventing anyone from coming in,
and you're the last person here.
Only one?
Yes.
No wonder no patients
are coming to see me.
We don't know what will happen tonight.
We need you to evacuate right away too.
I see.
But you don't need to worry about me.
I've known about Lupin for ages.
Because...
I'm myself!
Lupin!
Lupin!
Sorry, Old Man!
I'll take the magic lamp!
Oh, surprise...
Close!
Don't take me so lightly!
I already knew that it was you in disguise!
Oh jeez, Old Man...
Gotcha, Lupin!
Whoa, don't speak too soon.
You can't get away from me!
Lupin!
Yes?
I know your escape path!
Old Man!
Oh boy...
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Inspector!
Lupin is here!
Everybody, after him!
Yes sir!
Now then, I'll take...
That was too close.
Stop!
You're damaging my...
Lupin!
Let go, Old Man!
I won't!
Dammit, Old Man!
- No!- Damn persistent!
Come on, gimme!
It's mine!
Come on!
Inspector?
- This is Lupin!
- This is Lupin!
- Arrest him!
- Arrest him!
- What are you doing?!
- What are you doing?!
- He's a fake!
- He's a fake!
Look at him!
He's barefoot!
He's suspicious!
Hey! Stop it!
I'll take this to a safe place.
Lupin!
Look!
That's Lupin!
Don't let him get away!
Lupin!
I won't let you get away!
Bye!
Lupin!
I know exactly how you think!
Huh?!
Man, you are so damn persistent!
I'll fly, then!
I knew you'd do this, Lupin!
Stretch scissors!
I knew!
I knew!
He ran this way!
I knew!
Give up, Lupin!
There's no way out!
I see.
Then I have no choice but to go back in.
Give it up!
You can't get out of here!
You sure you are allowed to
come in with so many cars?
Leave it!
It's only a dummy!
Lupin!
That was so close, Old Man.
You fell for it, Lupin.
I knew you'd definitely come
in here if I cornered you.
It was all part of my plan.
I was thinking that this
elevator looked so big.
Of course, it's gonna help me.
What?
Later, Old Man.
Lupin! Damn it!
Old Man!
Old Man!
I knew all about this!
The current course is far off the target.
Unable to correct the course.
We will crash.
How can this be?!
Auto parachute disabled.
Switch to manual operation.
Why?
Give up!
All controls disabled.
Get out on your own.
Later, Old Man!
Lupin!
I-I'm still alive...
Lupin, I thought you
were coming to Macau.
I was, but Old Man really went out of
his way, so everything got out of hand.
You had it tough, huh.
Anyway, where am I?
Huh?
We're in heaven.
What the hell's that?
We're in heaven.
Like I said, everything broke.
We're in heaven.
Like I said, everything broke.
You're between thirty and forty
kilometres west of the Malay Peninsula.
It's right by Phuket.
Then would you come pick me up?
What a hassle.
The current time is 6:51:01 PM.
It's right.
It took too long to repair itself.
Oh man, the case has shattered.
We should...
take better care of...
Huh?
This is not the unearthed item.
I gotcha, Lupin!
It's a fake one!
I highly doubt that.
Don't tell me it's made in Japan.
Well, if I rub it and a
genie comes out, it's real.
Rub, rub...
Wonderful!
Did you call me, Master?
Master?
I'm the fairy of the lamp.
I will make any of your wishes come true.
Not a genie, but a fairy came out?
Miss Fairy, what's your name?
I'm the fairy of the lamp.
Yeah, but do you have a
name like Jenny or Marianne?
I'm the fairy of the lamp.
I guess "fairy" is fine.
I will make any of your wishes come true.
Really!
We're in heaven.
But I will take half of your remaining life.
We're in heaven.
But I will take half of your remaining life.
We're...
But I will take half of your remaining life.
Half of my life?
Master, I'm sorry, but your chance to
make a wish will cease in five seconds.
Five.
Four.
Three?! Wait a sec!
Three.
Three?! Wait a sec!
Please state your wish.
Let's start with a kiss!
What?
Wow!
Huh?!
Oh, wha, w-wait...
What's going on?!
Oh, wha, w-wait...
Oh, wha, w-wait...
Whoa!
Huh?!
Where am I?!
What am I doing?!
What time is it now?!
Lupin, can you hear me?!
Yes, this is Lupin!
Enough of that.
What about the woman?
Woman?
What?
What do you mean what?
Is something wrong?
I'm the one who wants to
know what went wrong!
Huh?!
What happened to me?!
Tell me about it!
Where am I?!
Send an ambulance here.
No, not an accident.
It got disconnected.
Fujiko?
I warned you that you'd get
hurt if you betrayed me.
Huh? Betray you?
What are you talking about?
Where is that woman?
Woman?
Please hurry.
Wait! Wait!
Thank you, you're done.
No mistake about it.
He is our Inspector
Zenigata from Interpol.
What happened to him?
We're not sure.
He was wandering about
in a jungle in Sumatra,
but he seems to have lost his memory.
What?
Is there something, sir?
Recently, there have been numerous cases
of Nobel Prize winners and Olympic
gold medalists being kidnapped,
but they are found a few days later
with various degrees of memory loss.
I'm aware of that.
It's a case of strange things
happening only to people
with a high degree of talent.
That's right.
That means it happened to our highly
talented Inspector Zenigata too.
I don't think that's related here.
I believe he just hit his head.
Oh, really.
Hey, now!
I can't move!
I'm totally fine!
He's ready.
Thank you.
Jeez...
Old Man!
"Old Man"?
You mean me?
"Boku"?!
Fujiko?
Don't worry.
Inspector Zenigata hit his head
and is suffering from amnesia.
Amnesia? Seriously?
Anyway, where's the treasure?
Treasure?
The magic lamp!
Where did you take it?!
Right. Where did I put it?
Hey! Don't play dumb with me!
I know you're working with that woman!
Who are you talking about?
Oh yeah?
Fine, if you claim that you forgot...
Yes?
I'll make you remember with this!
Stop!
I'm not here!
Take care!
A patient ran away!
Catch him!
There he is!
Over here!
Oh my, what a great view.
See ya later, Fujiko-chan!
Catch him!
See ya later, Fujiko-chan!
Flying squirrel!
In Singapore, huh...
I know I landed near Phuket.
I jumped a thousand
kilometres just like that?
Oh Jigen, come and...
Huh?
Wow! Wait!
Hey now...
In the middle of town...
Wait a sec!
Hey!
Ai-chan!
I don't know what's the deal with them,
but can't they drive like
they're having more fun?
Lupin, hand over the lamp.
Lamp?
And who are you?
I've given you my hello already.
That was your hello?
How could you have lived
for so long without knowing
how to give a proper hello?
Wait, hold...
Fire.
Oh my.
Give me the lamp, Lupin.
And who the hell are you?
I'm not about to waste time with you.
Hand over the lamp now.
I normally wouldn't forget
anyone with that kind of face,
but I don't have a clue who you are.
Idiot.
You should've handed it over.
Fire.
Fire?
Are they serious?!
Who the hell are they?!
Lupin!
Jigen!
I hate missiles!
What?!
Lupin, stay down!
Lupin!
Jigen-chan!
What a life saver!
Not yet.
This is just a waste of bullets!
Danger! Danger!
Stay away!
Stop!
They're out of their minds!
But this is really reckless too.
Memory lapse?
You don't remember
anything from last night?
Nope.
I got to the deserted beach at 7 PM,
so I have no memory of exactly
twelve hours until 7 AM.
It was as if I traveled through time.
What really happened?
I'm the one who wants to know that.
And who was that missile dude?
His name is Colonel Garlic.
The world fears him,
calling him the Warmonger.
Warmonger?
I have no interest in war though.
We were attacked by Garlic last night too.
You don't remember that either?
That's why I'm asking
you to tell me about it!
Well, fine.
It must be pretty serious if you're
dressed like that for no reason.
It was about 10 PM when I
picked you up in a chopper.
What about the lamp?
You were carrying it.
You had a huge grin on your face.
And?
Then we headed straight to Sentosa
Island in Singapore from there.
That's where Fujiko was waiting in a hotel.
Sorry it took so long, Fujiko-chan!
But Garlic and his men
were waiting there too.
Lupin, hand over that lamp.
It's not the sort of treasure
that you should possess.
Who's that?
That's Colonel Garlic, the Warmonger.
Fire!
So? Remember anything yet?
Not a damn thing.
Then?
We ran for our lives.
Then?
Lupin!
It's me!
Fujiko! You were safe, huh?
Lupin! You OK?!
Thank you.
You're so caring, Fujiko-chan.
So this is the magic lamp!
That's all I know.
You ran away with Fujiko.
Ask Fujiko what happened after that.
Fujiko said I betrayed her.
Then maybe the woman
is involved somehow.
Woman?
When you called me this morning...
Lupin, what's going on?
A woman showed up out of nowhere.
A woman?
What?
Wow!
Huh?!
Oh, wha, w-wait...
Whoa!
What's going on?!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Huh?!
Where am I?!
What am I doing?!
What time is it now?!
Lupin, can you hear me?!
Yes, this is Lupin!
Enough of that.
What about the woman?
Woman?
What?
What do you mean what?
Is something wrong?
I'm the one who wants to
know what went wrong!
Huh?!
What happened to me?!
Tell me about it!
Where am I?!
That's when the phone got cut off.
Oh, give me more coffee.
I remember what happened after that.
I got hit by Fujiko's car and
was taken to the hospital.
Then what about the woman?
I don't have a clue.
The only one I met last
night was that fairy.
Fairy?
A really hot fairy babe came
out when I rubbed the lamp.
She said she'd make any
wish come true, so...
But I will take half of your remaining life.
That's it!
But I will take half of your remaining life.
That's it!
What is it?
The fairy said that she'll take
half of my remaining life.
It meant that she was going to steal a half
a day of my memory, from 7 PM to 7 AM.
Yeah, right!
Now what, Jigen?!
I'm going to lose my memory of nights!
Memories of robberies...
Memories of nice times with babes...
All the fun memories gone...
Hey Lupin, watch your table manners.
You were watching that?
Then I'll give you the "magic glasses," with
which you can see something even better.
Thank you...
Wait a sec!
Recently, world-renowned scientists
and such have been kidnapped,
and then have part of their
memories erased, have totally
different personalities, etc.
Could it be...
You think this is related?
Lupin,
Lupin!
Lupin, hand over the lamp
if you want her back alive.
Shut the audio off!
Lupin, hand over the lamp
if you want her back alive.
Turn it off!
Lupin, hand over the lamp
if you want her back alive.
Lupin! Please help me!
Give me a call right now.
I'll be waiting.
Are you going?
Of course.
I'm sure it's a trap.
Fujiko-chan is asking for help.
I've got to go.
That's my biggest worry.
Maybe...
So, what do you want me to do?
Get on the very last car.
The last one?
You should've mentioned that first!
In the first-class section.
That's not my issue.
Is Garlic gonna throw a
private party for me?
So, would you care to join me, Miss?
It's first-class.
I was just thinking I didn't want
to make this long trip alone.
Hey, stop!
I was just thinking I didn't want
to make this long trip alone.
I was just thinking I didn't want
to make this long trip alone.
It'd be even better if we could talk.
Um...
You don't remember me?
How could I forget about you?!
Not a hot babe like you!
Yeah, I had a great time last night.
What's my name?
Well?
Oh, your name?
Well...
You forgot?
I didn't.
There's a reason behind this...
Just between you and me,
I'm terrible with names.
I'd remember if you can tell me...
I'm Marianne.
That's it! Marianne!
I lied.
I'm sorry.
I have the wrong person.
No, you didn't!
I'm Lupin.
Lupin III.
And I'm a thief.
See? I'm the right one.
I'm Drew.
So you did forget.
No, not at all!
You're Drew-chan.
Yes, you did forget.
Yes, just your name.
Lupin...
Please save me.
Oh, that's it?
You could've asked me sooner.
Oh my.
Get down!
Garlic!
Looks like you finally
remembered my name.
Fujiko better be safe.
Fujiko is probably working
with Garlic behind your back.
Who is that woman?
Well, she's...
You really are working with that woman!
Fujiko!
Drew! Give me back the lamp already!
Drew?
Don't believe her.
Please believe me, Lupin!
Lupin! Hand over the lamp now!
Don't shoot!
The lamp is right here!
Here, take this!
My lamp!
Hey, what's this?!
Don't!
You have no place to run.
I cut another worthless object.
Huh?
Hey! Goemon!
Cut the wire!
Cut the wire!
Hold your positions!
Still!
Check the balance!
Lupin!
No apology is good enough!
Hey!
Fujiko!
She was against you the whole time.
Yeah.
Yuck!
So, what about the lamp?
Yuck!
So, what about the lamp?
I swallowed some water!
Drew would know something.
Drew?
You OK?
Yes. This...
You are...
the fairy of the lamp!
Wait, Drew!
You cut another worthless object?
Leaving the "worthless object"
on the rails will trouble others.
Don't be...
I'm not a wolf, so you don't
have to run away from me.
OK, fairy?
I'm not a fairy.
Yes, you're the lamp fairy.
I'm not.
Let go!
Like I said, I'm not a wolf.
I'm a thief.
You, me, and the lamp are
very much related, aren't we?
We're not.
Oh.
Don't tell me that.
Wasn't that why you were stalking me?
I don't know.
You don't know?
But you asked me to help you.
I'm looking for help too.
I'm totally lost. What in
the world is going on?
Eichmann?
Dr. Eichmann is a leading expert
on saving people's memories,
and what he invented was the Laser
Automatic Memory Program L.A.M.P.
L.A.M.P., the Lamp.
Right, a magic lamp.
It transfers the memory by translating
the brain waves into a digital signal,
enabling its storage.
It can copy the data, but..
But it can take away memory too, huh?
So, my memory is in that lamp...
It's still in your head.
In the microchip implanted in your head.
Oh yeah, I remember the sensation
of a mosquito bite or something.
It will take away your
memory every twelve hours.
That simplifies things.
How?
My memory won't be taken
away if we extract it, right?
We can't.
There's no way of extracting it.
You're out of your mind.
Out of my mind?
Drew! This way!
Is that Garlic?
Let's go, Drew.
Jump in!
Lupin!
I'm sorry, Lupin.
I'm the one who ran off with the lamp.
Are you listening?
You're out of your mind.
You did it against your will, because
that Eichmann guy forced you, right?
I don't make mistakes about babes.
How...
How?
It's not really a matter of how...
I stole it from you.
Drew!
Who's that?
She's the daughter of an oil tycoon.
She's going to buy this
lamp for a good price.
How can you? A fter I went
through so much to get it!
Hey, what are you doing?
Give it to me rather than sell it!
No! Give it back!
Give it to me rather than sell it!
No! Give it back!
I'll steal anything you want in its place.
Hey!
Thank you, Lupin.
Hey now!
I see...
That's why Fujiko thinks I betrayed her.
I'm sorry.
It's OK.
And...
now the lamp is with Eichmann, but...
But he didn't give you your memory back.
Man, he has weird tastes,
stealing my memory.
Did he steal your memory too?
A memory scanning device?
Yes.
I went through all that just for this device?
What did you think it was?
A magic lamp.
A magic lamp that can make any dream
come trueaa"like making me rich.
Yes, I can control the world with that.
Control the world?
We located Lupin!
Where is he?!
He's on a moving freight
train with the woman!
Did they find us?
Target locked on!
Don't kill either one!
Shoot their limbs so
they can't go anywhere!
Roger!
Drew!
Move, Drew!
Keep moving!
Oh...
Lupin!
Drew, don't let go of the handle!
What do you want?
Jigen!
Lupin, you OK?
You could've come sooner.
Bullets are useless against Goemon.
Stop attacking him!
Retreat at once!
Roger!
Oh dear, it's raining.
You're safe now.
Lupin, you're really out of your mind.
Wha...
Inspector Zenigata is missing?!
I'm terribly sorry.
He seems to have wandered off in the
brief moment we weren't watching him.
That's not good.
Who am I really?
People called me Inspector Zenigata.
Eichmann's assistant?
Yes.
My brother, Adam, a brain surgeon,
was working with him back then.
And he invited me to join the staff.
What's the matter,
Drew?
They were playing together
yesterday, but now...
Yeah, because we erased
all of their memories...
...they forgot that they were brothers.
Poor them.
They can be friends again even if
they forgot that they were brothers.
You're too kind,
but this is for the benefit
of the technology.
That's a tough brother.
He's so kind that it's almost too much.
I see.
We lost our parents in a civil war.
I have not forgotten how they died,
having no doctors to treat them.
After surviving that day,
we studied medicine
and joined the medical support
group on the war front.
But the wars didn't cease to exist.
And we could only save so many lives.
Not only that, but there were times
when they bombed the field hospitals.
We were in deep despair.
That's when we met Eichmann.
Eichmann hated war and violence too.
The idea of eliminating the war with
neuroscience was very new to us.
But his experiments started
to move into dangerous areas.
Doctor! Human experimentation
is too reckless!
It's too dangerous!
Drew, I'm running out of time.
Please don't stop me.
Drew!
Adam!
Wait, Doctor.
Doctor!
And?
How did you feel?
Here you go.
Who are you?
Where am I?
Calm down.
This is our new lab.
New lab?
Here.
It felt like I'd slipped through time.
Right. Three years had passed.
Three years?
Eichmann erased three years
of my memories for my safety.
How did that make any sense?!
And your brother, Adam, just watched?
He's missing.
I'm sure he disagreed with
Eichmann's experiments.
He might be confined somewhere.
Or maybe dead.
I have no idea what happened
in those three years.
If I can get my memories back...
But Drew, couldn't you get your
memories back when you had the lamp?
The lamp alone is not enough
to recover memories.
It must be connected to the
host computer at the lab.
But still, it's not a wise move to
do what Eichmann asks of you.
It's unfathomable.
I want to know where my brother is!
If he's captured somewhere,
I need to save him!
Drew...
If he's captured somewhere,
I need to save him!
If he's captured somewhere,
I need to save him!
Drew!
Jigen,
that woman is incomprehensible.
Yeah.
Driving such a damn big car!
O-Old Man!
Run for your life!
D-Did I do something wrong?!
Drew, go on without me!
What's the matter?!
An engine problem!
Communication with the
chopper has been lost!
Hurry the hell up!
Yes, sir!
I'll be taking this.
What did they have on board?!
What's going...
Zenigata!
Do you know who I am?
"Boku"?!
Tell me!
Who am I?
Stay out of my way!
I cut another worthless object.
I'm sorry!
It's me.
Three choppers are approaching fast!
We're okay for now.
I'm hopeless now.
But you and I share the experience
of having our memories stolen.
Let's get our memories back together.
You want to find your brother, don't you?
What if...
What if I'm a murderer?
I don't know what happened
in those three years.
What if I killed a person?
What if I get a memory like that back...
Like I said, I don't make
mistakes looking at babes.
You don't know anything.
I'm a thief,
and a thief can't forget about
having something stolen from him.
You asked me to help you.
You asked, knowing I'm the
world's best, didn't you?
Then don't you worry about a
thing, and leave everything to me.
Lupin...
But you'll forget everything
about me in the morning.
No, I won't.
But that's impossible.
It's okay.
It's not!
Why...
Ta-da!
And this!
I saw it in a street shop tonight.
I bought it even though I'm a thief.
With this, I'll remember.
Let's see. I'll forget
everything after 7 o'clock...
That was when my disguise
came off, and we were fleeing.
Where am I?
7 o'clock...
Let's see...
Fujiko is with Garlic.
The fairy was Drew.
Drew!
Lupin,
you're awake now?
What's the matter?
It's...
Fairy and I...
You and I...
You lost your memory?
I had my wish with the fairy, you...
So you did.
Such an important night's...
This isn't called making the wish come...
Lupin.
Hi, Lupin.
Having fun already?
Fujiko!
It's okay, Lupin, because this
might be the last fun you have.
Lupin, you might think your life is safe
as long as you have the lamp, but...
that could be the mistake of your life.
This way, Drew!
I'll get you next time, Lupin!
I hurt my right arm...
That samurai last night
seemed to know who I am.
I was almost killed. Am I a bad person?
There you are!
Inspector Zenigata!
Zenigata!
Sir, this is the Director
of Interpol Asia, Gordon.
We've been looking for you, Zenigata.
We were very concerned about you.
You still need more treatment.
The brain surgeon was
concerned about you too.
Now, let's head back to the hospital.
Sir!
Inspector!
Capture him!
Sir!
Please stop, sir!
Zenigata!
I see.
So they can pull anything
out of a brain and use it.
Yes.
Man, that's one hell of a lamp.
It was Eichmann who kidnapped
the scientists and athletes.
It was.
No wonder Garlic's after it.
You can create cruel soldiers who
know no fear if you eliminate
any human-like emotions.
Do you think a truly
peaceful world is possible?
I'm not sure.
Everyone avoids the answer,
but no such thing is possible.
Right.
The order of the world
is controlled by wars,
using large amounts of money.
Really?
Being an arms merchant is the most
realistic and best business there is.
I'll leave that up to you.
See you later.
Fujiko, weren't you listening to me?
Huh? About what?
Oh, that's right.
Hello?
Hey, Jigen, you all right?
And what about you?
And your memory?
It's totally gone again.
And this time, it's the worst one to lose.
Have you seen Goemon?
Goemon? No.
Did something happen to him?
Are you with Drew?
Could you tell?
We were together the
whole time, all night long!
But you have no memory of it.
You'd better watch out.
Don't you bad-mouth my Arabian
night with my dear fairy!
This damn Jigen...
Hang up.
Drew...
Hey! Lupin!
I'll talk to ya later!
Drew, that's not a water gun.
Don't move!
Don't move.
I'm busy right now!
Goemon?
Where are you now?
Right here.
Whoa!
What's going on, Goemon?
I thought you'd be shocked if I showed
up with no notice, so I gave you a call.
What?
What's going on, Goemon-chan?
Nothing.
Goemon is no longer on your side.
Goemon!
Worry not.
I do not cut anything worthless.
This isn't Goemon...
Repair team! What are you doing?!
I told you that we'll commence
the plan immediately!
What's this about?!
They became the robot soldiers
you wanted them to be.
What?
We've captured Garlic.
Please don't forget the promise
we made, Dr. Eichmann.
Eichmann?
I love the kind of business where I
can make money with just phone calls.
Tell Eichmann
that he'll get what he deserves
for pissing off the Warmonger!
Welcome, Lupin.
Not even the greatest thief in
the world can do anything when
his memory is stolen, huh?
Are you Eichmann?
Did you do the same thing to
Goeman that you did to me?
There is more than one use for the lamp.
The microchip implanted
in you is a special one.
In his case, I eliminated only the
impure thoughts from his mind.
You scum!
That's why Goemon acted all weird!
You just don't get it.
I was given the pure mind that
I could not achieve with even
the most intense training.
Goemon...
Drew!
Did he give you your memories back?
It's better not to regain the memories
of those three years for her own sake.
Human brains naturally have the
same type of defense mechanism.
I'm only doing the same things
that are part of treatments.
Treatments?
She opposed my experiments
and stole the lamp out of the lab
in order to stop my research.
But it's better for her not to
remember why she did such a thing.
And by the turn of fate, I was
able to lure you and Garlic.
You two are very
well-known to be antisocial.
I've collected minds of the greatest
scientists, artists and athletes,
but it is extremely difficult to collect
the minds of antisocial types like you.
Eichmann! What exactly are you after?!
I will create a beautiful and peaceful world.
It will be the first in man's history.
I will eliminate the evil
memories from people's minds
that have been passed
down for generations.
The result will be a beautiful
world with no violence.
Yeah?
Then I'm gonna get going.
But first, let me see that
ghost-like face of yours...
Wh-What the heck?!
Dammit!
These are Garlic's...
They are no longer Garlic's soldiers.
They are soldiers of peace.
Garlic will become one as well one day.
Garlic will always be Garlic.
Lupin, you have extraordinary
wit and initiative.
Be born again, and contribute
to the beautiful world.
Be born again?
You're kidding me.
We've been thieves for generations.
It'd be a disgrace to my
ancestors if I quit being a thief!
Oh, Goemon-chan...
We're now moving on to the second stage.
We will now collect all of your memories.
Drew!
Goemon! Take Lupin away!
Sir!
Goemon-chan, take your Zantetsu
Sword, and chop this away!
I told you. I do not cut worthless objects.
Let's see. I'll forget
everything after 7 o'clock...
That was when my disguise
came off, and we were fleeing.
Oh, that's it.
Lupin, I may betray you again,
but that's not what I want to do.
Please believe me on that,
no matter what happens.
Believe me until the very end.
No need to tell me that.
See?
Goemon-chan...
Lupin!
Drew!
Don't cut it!
It's really worthless!
See?
Jigen!
This again...
We'll retreat.
Good job, Jigen-chan.
Drew, what are you doing?
Get on!
Goemon! Come back!
Drew! Hurry!
Drew, let's go.
Drew! Come!
Get in, Lupin!
Hey! Lupin!
Now, let's go.
Drew!
Goemon! We'll come
back to save you later!
Drew...
Even Lupin got away.
There's no need to rush.
Lupin will definitely come.
Most definitely.
Or else, he'll be done for.
Done for?
Don't worry, Jigen.
Drew didn't side with Eichmann.
She just pretended to be.
You sure?
See?
You could track me down
because of this, right?
Well, yeah.
She could've gotten rid
of it if she wanted to.
Well, yeah.
Stop saying that!
Drew and I spent the sweet,
sweet Arabian night togethaa"
Lupin...
Drew and I spent the sweet,
sweet Arabian night togethaa"
I'm sorry.
Lupin wrote memos all over his
body before he lost his memory,
including what I confessed.
Memos?
But I couldn't take you to
Eichmann looking like that.
So I wanted to wash off the memos.
So you...
Knowing you, you joined
willingly, didn't you?
Probably.
You washed off memos,
memories, everything!
I suppose so.
And you still trust Drew, huh?
Because of my undies.
It was written on my undies.
Inside them, I saw "Trust
Drew until the end."
Undies, huh?
That's perfect for you.
But it's almost 7 again.
Yeah, my memories from this
point on will be gone too.
Stop the car!
What's the matter, Drew?
Lupin, it won't be the same this time.
The microchip in you is a special one.
It was still experimental.
Experimental?
It's been proven that two memory
wipes is the limit that a human can take.
If another memory wipe is executed
in such a short amount of time,
you may lose more than twelve
hours worth of memories.
Which means?
In an experiment with monkeys,
they lost all of their memories.
And what if I lose all of my memories?
I don't know.
But even if you look like Lupin,
you will no longer be Lupin.
Me, who is not me?
What about me?
I don't want to see you not being you.
If the experiment on monkeys
ended that way, there's a good
chance you'll end up the same.
What?!
Whatever the case, I just need to
disable the chip before 7 AM, right?
I'll take back the memories
they took too, of course.
All right, let's hurry.
A jail?
Yes, for all the most violent
felons from around the world.
Oh my.
Don't worry.
It's now the world's most peaceful island.
Peaceful?
Look at them.
They are all criminals.
Sure, it looks peaceful,
but I can't stand a life with
no thrill and excitement.
It'll be okay.
It will?
You can relax here tonight.
Where shall I put your suitcase?
Excuse me?
Oh, you can put it anywhere.
Thank you.
This man is sentenced to 212
years in jail for seven crimes.
You will soon be able to
enjoy true happiness.
Does he want to use me in his experiment?
So that's Sultan Island?
Yes.
It used to be an uninhabited island, but
it's now a privately owned prison island.
Hm? Is that the prison?
What sits on top of the hill is the lab.
It's located there so it can
see every spot on the island.
So Eichmann is the king of the island.
It's 6:05 now.
Oh yeah?
Fifty-five minutes until
you turn into a monkey.
Muki!
I wish we had this lamp.
Yeah.
What would you wish
of the man in the lamp?
Well, I would...
Drew,
step back and stay low.
We never know what will come flying.
Yeah, since there are
soldiers of peace there.
We'll drive straight in.
And now...
Charge!
What the heck did they
do to wind up here?
Probably committed some heinous crime.
That's...
So this is what Eichmann wants to do.
Maybe we can get there without incident.
Of course, it's not that easy.
One shot left!
Already?!
They don't cry or anything.
I guess they feel no pain.
We'll charge in!
Yeah!
Drew! Stay hidden here!
Drew!
Drew!
Drive away, Drew!
Lupin!
Lupin.
Okay.
We've captured Lupin!
Good.
Bring him to the central operating room.
Yes, sir.
Drew!
No! Don't enter that cave!
We've brought him.
We meet again, Lupin.
I will collect all of his memories in a minute.
Keep him in under guard and stay put.
Oh man, isn't this too good to be true?
That he didn't see this trick?
You see, simple tricks like
disguises work well against
people who make this weird stuff.
Jigen, come help me.
Awake already?
Stay asleep a while longer.
All right, no rush at all.
Jigen, do exactly as Drew wrote.
You want it exactly as what she wrote?
Hell yeah!
Now, go for it.
Goemon!
Let me show you true sword
mastery without impure thoughts.
Fine...
Jigen, you fail with your reaction.
Ya think so?
Oh my, Goemon-chan.
You totally lost your sword mastery.
I guess he needs his impure thoughts.
Sheesh.
Then let's give him his
impure thoughts back first.
Drew!
Jigen, take care of Goemon!
Lupin?! You have no time to waste!
I'll be right back!
Damn it.
This just sucks!
Although the bed was really comfortable,
I don't want to be a lab rat.
Why...
Drew...
This...
is Eichmann's grave, isn't it?
I killed him, didn't I?
Didn't I, Adam?
Just as I thought.
You knew?
I may have lost my memories, but
I did not cease to be your sister.
I killed Eichmann that day, didn't I?
And you erased my memories to
save me from the agony, didn't you?
No, that's not what happened.
Then what happened?
Lupin!
Why did you disguise
yourself as Eichmann, Adam?
It wasn't a disguise.
I am Eichmann.
What?
You OK, Goemon?
Jigen, what was I just doing?
Huh? Did you lose your memory this time?
I thought I was chasing after Drew
when Zenigata interfered, and...
Anyway, we have no time to waste.
We've gotta hurry, or Lupin
will turn into a monkey!
Lupin will turn into a monkey?
In twenty minutes!
Let's go!
Come on!
This is peace?! Bullshit!
Hey, now!
Garlic!
You came for me?
Fujiko! Whose side will you be on this time?!
Drew, you didn't kill Eichmann.
He died from an illness three years ago.
I decided to continue his research.
And...
You...
took over his memories?
Yes, I transferred them into my brain.
He is still alive as a part of me.
Adam!
You were against that idea,
and we fought many times over it.
And that's when the big brother
erased the little sister's memories.
So you were the one
behind the abductions!
Drew! Remember the
hell we've been through!
Even today, the same wrongdoings
are being repeated all over the world!
This is the only way to eliminate wars!
But that's wrong!
Even if that eliminates wars, that's
not a world for people to live in!
Drew!
That research was...
What's going on?
Help!
Fujiko!
Eichmann! This is the end of your life!
Stop! It's me!
I'm done with all of you too!
Hey!
I guess it's too much even for Fujiko.
Goemon.
Goemon!
I'll deal with you later.
What was that for, Goemon?!
Garlic!
Adam!
I hate this!
He's out of his mind.
Goemon!
Oh?
My!
I cut another worthless object.
How could this be?!
Adam!
Drew!
Damn Garlic!
I'm done with you too!
Drew!
Drew!
Lupin, don't mind me! Go
take care of yourself!
Lupin!
What are you doing?!
You're running out of time!
There's still plenty of time.
Why?!
You need to get your memories
back, or you'll turn into a monkey!
A monkey would be able to
climb this cliff with no problem...
You really are out of your mind.
What would you wish
of the man in the lamp?
Well, I'd ask for a peaceful
world with no wars.
Do you think he'd make one?
Die, Lupin.
Hang on tight!
Jigen!
Here we go, Drew!
Drew! Hurry!
You first!
I don't need it.
Drew!
I don't want any sad memories back.
Besides, I may lose the new memories
to get back the old memories.
I may lose the memories
I made with you, Lupin!
You may lose those memories now,
but you might remember them later.
Not here, but somewhere else.
Lupin...
Oh, wow!
Let's do this before I become a monkey!
It may not be all good stuff,
but you can catch up again in three years.
Lupin!
I won't forget about you.
Eichmann! Die!
This is war!
You'll die in this rubble!
Lupin! Hurry up before
the building caves in!
We're almost done!
Did you...
Watch after her, Jigen!
OK.
Awright!
I won't give my memories to anyone!
I'll take 'em all back!
Come on...
Wha?
Is this it?!
Yeah!
Countdown sequence!
Drew,
I'm sorry.
Who...
are you?
Jigen,
where's Goemon?
Who knows?
Sheesh, it couldn't be any worse.
He could've saved me in a better...
I don't think that he's not
looking for any thanks from you...
Thanks?
I'm sure he's run off
for more training again.
I'm the fairy of the lamp.
Please state your wish.
Let's start with a kiss!
That wasn't very exciting.
I wish I could have a real kiss.
Lupin!
Lupin!
Lupin!
Thank you, fairy.
My wish came true.

How sad.
She forgot everything about you.
Nah.
She didn't forget.
She just doesn't have
time to remember now.
She has so much to do as a scientist.
Anyway, you sure are something
that you got all of your memoraa"
Hell, of course!
A thief won't let anyone else stealaa"huh?
Old Man?
Look at you.
Hang on there.
Yes?
Here, keep this.
Thank you for your kindness.
I cannot take this.
It's a phone.
Ow...
I slipped.
Lupin!
Oh!
You're under arrest!
Wait!
Old Man, you remember now?
You didn't have to do that!
Hold it right there, Lupin!
Lupin!
Come on! Answer me!
