<i>But I don't know your name.</i>
<i>I know I'm dreaming. But it

<i>Five years since

<i>Victoria and I were

<i>In two weeks, our mission here will be

<i>But the questions I ask,

<i>The things I wonder about,
she won't.</i>
<i>It's been half a century since the
scavengers destroyed our moon.</i>
<i>Forced to leave their own dying
planet, they came to take ours.</i>
<i>Without the moon, the Earth
was thrown into chaos.</i>
<i>Earthquakes toppled
cities within hours.</i>
<i>Tsunamis wiped
out what remained.</i>
<i>Then came the invasion.</i>
<i>We did what we had to do.</i>
<i>We used the nukes.</i>
<i>We won the war,

<i>Left it contaminated.
Most of it uninhabitable.</i>
<i>What remained of humanity
had to leave the Earth.</i>
<i>We built the Tet,
our mission control.</i>
<i>A temporary space station
before the migration to Titan,</i>
<i>Saturn's largest moon.</i>
<i>Everyone's there now.</i>
<i>Well, almost everyone.</i>
<i>Until our tour is complete,

<i>We protect the hydro rigs,</i>

<i>The survival of humanity

<i>Mission says we have done well.</i>

<i>Vika's my

The last Super Bowl.

<i>And a new fuel cell is
not going to fix that.</i>
But this QB runs back,
and picks up his own fumble.
Hold on, what did you just do?
<i>There's a wall of linebackers
closing in on him.</i>
<i>So, he throws a long ball with
no idea who is at the other end.</i>
A Hail Mary.

We would grow old

I'd been in the army less than a
year when that unholy Tet arrived.
I saw the moon get taken out.
Right up there
in the night sky.
I couldn't believe it.
After that, nature took over.
There's bedrock around Chicago,
so we were spared the worst
of the waves and the quakes.
Most people just starved.
Then the Tet sent
troop ships down.
The doors opened,
and out you came.
Astronaut Jack Harper.
Thousands of you.
Memory wiped.
Programmed to kill.
They had taken one of our best
and turned him against us.
No soul.
No humanity.
The Tet.
What a brilliant machine.
Feeding off one planet
after another for energy.
Phase Two was drones.
Repairmen.
50 years of watching those hydro
rigs suck our planet dry.
Then one day,
I saw you set down.
Another drone to fix.
But in the rubble
that day was a book.
You picked it up.
You studied it.
And I thought I saw a way.
When you stepped in front of
that drone and saved her,
I knew.
You were in there somewhere.
I just had to find
a way to bring you back.
