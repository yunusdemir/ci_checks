In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
Tremble!
Tremble.
Whose name is the Terrible.
Whose name is Baleful.
Whose name is inaccessible.
Whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness.
Kaili!
We turn our hearts to Kaili,
Drinker of blood, Black Mother.
Kaili!
Killer of demons,
gorge on this flesh, our offering.
- Drink...
- Halt!
- Halt?
- The ring.
She is not wearing
the sacrificial ring.
She cannot be sacrificed
without the ring.
Where is the ring?
What has she done with the ring?
The ring! The ring!

Over the water we must go.

- You ask of me, Master?
- Obedience and Love.

- This is so.
- The ring.
- Has nobody looked on the washbasin?
I am making the immediate
arrangements for my necessary...

- In hand.
Something must be done.
Without the ring,
there will be no sacrifice,
without the sacrifice,
no congregation.
Without a congregation...
...no more me.
This is so.
- Wave.
- I don't like to.
- Go on, wave.
- Shall I?
They expect it, don't they.
Lovely lads and so natural.
Adoration hasn't gone to their heads.
You know what I mean, success.
So natural and still the same
as they was before they was.
- Someone's got hold of my finger.
- You trying to attract attention again?
She's pulling at it.
on!
Ow!
She had my finger, you know...
Stop trying to drag things down
to your own level.
I thought she was a sandwich
until she went spare on my hand.
It's cold. It's a cold place.
- So, the ring?
- No. I could not get it off, Swami.
Oh dear!
Hey! Have you been messing with me
in my kip?
I mean, with a fishing rod.
I wouldn't touch you with a plastic one.
What are you doing on the floor?
I'm tired.
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hey, Bea-atle!
<i>How about this, Shufti?</i>
Gold! All of it, pure gold.
In easy to handle
denominational nuggets. Unmarked.
- Not a mark on them.
- No, I hate them.
- No.
- It makes your fingers go green.
It's not the Beatle with the ring.
- Aren't I?
- No, unfortunately.
Ah!
Hey, Bea-atle.
You shall have fun, eh?
No thanks, I'm rhythm guitar
and mouth organ.
I didn't encourage that wink.
- It is not the one.
- My gosh.
They all look the same in their similitude

Swami, it's raining on your...

- Quickly, quickly.
- Yes, yes.
- Right, right.
- All in.

Ha, ha!

You naughty boy.
Now for the ring!
Ow!
Oh! Oh, that stings.
Kaili!
Kaili!
Flee!
Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?
- Flee!
- OK.
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.
Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
What? Who? Where?
Now... If you'll pardon me.
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
Hey, Abdul!
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
Very nice he was, too.
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
Is this ring nasty, sir?
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
Oh! That's better.
Excuse me...
This menu...
I've just seen the most amazing thing...
Oh...
Hey, did you...
There's a man down there on his head.
Arthur?
Could you pick this up for me, please?
Are you eating, too, Paul?
Your friend is in mortal danger.
I can say no more.
It's rather a jolly place.
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
He has three hours to live.
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
I ordered soup too.
- Soup!
- Soup
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
Excuse me. If he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
why is he not painted red?
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
- What's this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
All are happy to go-
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
Three hours to live.
- You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
You are lucky to be chosen!
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
- What's this?
- A season ticket.
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
There's somebody been in this soup.
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
No? Come off!
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
who will then go happy to Kaili.
- Thank you.
- Three hours.
There's a footprint in here.
Here, you have a go.
Flee!
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
This ring is not stone.
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
Three ten.
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
This won't work.
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
Made in America you see.
Another failure.
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
- What's your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
It's not dropping off.
VOltagel
Voltagemup, up___
Up, up!
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
This is English.
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places it's brown.
He's not earthed.
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
Done.
-5... 4...
- Come on.
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
He used to use his hands.
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
- Voltage...up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
The voltage, up, up, UP!
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
The bunker!
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
Stop it!
It's more than my job's worth!
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
Fantastic!
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
Thelasenn
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

No! It is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
How do we know you're not sent by him
to nick the ring,
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
Don't look.
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
There might be some insurance.
I wouldn't think of such a thing!

What did you say that stuff is?
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. It's a minor medical secret.
I'm sure there's no call for all this.

No. As long as you don't swallow it.

I demand that ring.
It's yours!
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
No, I could not.
I can't get it off.
- Paul?

- Hey!
- We're being attacked!
Retreat! Retreat!
Come on! We're being fired at!
Get out of here!
Come on! Retreat!
Run!
Quick! Faster!
Hey, mind the tank!
Get up, Johnny!
- Stop!
- Johnny! Walk for me. You can do it!
In here! Quickly! Quick!
- Fire!
- Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
- Left! Steady on. 1-500.
-1-500.
I regret losing a lieutenant
as able as Ahme
but she was told the price of capture.
- Enemy tank moving from left to right.
- Loaded.
<i>- Well, fire the nasty thing.
- Firing now, Saheb.</i>
Missed! You naughty boys.
Turn us right.
Fire!
(♪ "1812 Overture" plays)
There must be somewhere in England
where one can find sanctuary to think.
How's your equilibrium, Ringo?
How's yours?
You're light again, George.
- How do you know it's not you.
- Cos I never am, am I Paul?
Here, cop this, one hand!
- Ugly, though.
- The hands?
- Some people's are.
- Show us your hand, Ringo.
- You want to chuck one in?
- Get on!
- How about drumming, though?
- It won't affect it.
I don't know many...
It appears I need one card.
I'm chucking one in.
Very light-hearted.
- Discarding it.
- Like an old boot.
They're talking about your finger,
you know.
One card. Dealer takes one.
See, that didn't hurt.
- Will you hold this drumstick?
- Manchester has a good drummer.
Well, I don't just drum with it, do I?
- What else then?
- I use it, you know.
Quite a good-looking fellow, too.
I'll raise you.
You haven't used that finger
in the past hour and we're in danger.
Me and Paul haven't seen you
use of that finger, have we?
- No.
- And again.
We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.
That bloke with Scott,
I've always admired the way he went
into the snow for his mates.
- And again.
- You're joking!
Just hold this drumstick.
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.
- It's like having a tooth out.
- I've got a good hand.
You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.
I will see... I've won it.
- Cut.
- No!
I think tea, don't you? Tea.
They expect me to cut my finger off.
The famous finger, eh?
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?
What's that... It's haunted, you know.
- Are you going to cut?
- No, I'm not and let that be an end to it.
End to it!
This wing of the palace is haunted.
We won't leave this palace alive.
The Queen will have something
to say about that.
- What's that?
- I beg your pardon?
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- I daren't look!
It's only a hose.
- It's for you.
- It's the gardener.
I'll stick it out the window.
Eyes left.
Eyes front!
Must be their tea break.
Hands up!
Hands up! Quick!
Come on, lets have you.
Steady!
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...
Lets have that ring.
It's me, you fool.
- Quick! Quick!
- Let's catch him!
This should work,
it's from Harvard.
- It looks like a laser.
- It's a relativity cadenza.
That should slow them down a bit.
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!
Hurry up with the plug,
I'll align the sights... Yes!
Right, good.
I think it is a laser.
Oh!
on...
A royal fuse has just blown.
- It is a rela...teva...camenza...
- Bad machine!
Hair dryer, I'll bet
she had one for Christmas.
We are going for a friendly walk
with the police down by the river.
Ooh, look at that.
- It's a band.
Paint! Paint!
Come on, quickly!
Get them, men. I'm with you.
After them! After them! Quick!
Look.
Oh, lovely pub.
Two lagers and lime
and two lagers and lime, please.
- Looks like it's me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
Look John, I've had some great times
with this finger.
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?
You're a rat underneath.
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.
It's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it.
- Is there a cure for nail biting?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, yes!
I'm always getting winked at these days.
It used to be you, Paul.
Oh, Sorry Ringo.
Peep boo!
All the rungs have been neatly sawn
in the middle.
Ah, the window!
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?
It goes like this...
(♪ Whistles “Ode To Joy")
- What?
- This trap door.
Oh, here you are...
Permit me.
It's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
Come on! Come on!
(♪ Sings "Ode To Joy" in German)
(♪ Chorus sings "Ode To Joy")
Beep,beep!
Psst!
- Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
We're not going there.
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
Him!
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
I'd like to present PC 17...
- PC 6...
- Very smart.
- PC 47...
- Uh-huh.
- PC 6 of 3...
- Oh.
- PC 9...
- Hmm.
- PC 85...
- Mmm.
- PC 4...
- Yes.
PC 21, PC 85...
You should have thought of that
before you left the house.
Left... To shore...

- Let's play a game, eh? Beep-beeps.
- OK.
Beep-beep, beep-beep!
Oh, oh, oh!
Radar's broken! Never mind.
Beatles! Hello!
Port... Starboard... Over there!
Oh, oh, oh!
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!
Open that rock!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
- What's this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
You don't go for all that,
do you?
Keeps you busy, eh?
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.
I don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
- In here, quick.
- I can't swim.
I'm not going!
Where have they gone?
- Let's go back and get them!
- I'm game.
- Let's smash them!
- Let's find that temple.
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
- Let's go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Let's go back and get them.
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
Red light.
Kaili!
- Green light, go!
- Kaili!
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
And this guidebook.
- To the temple.
After them...slowly!
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
That's my theory.
Ugh!
- Aren't we going in?
- No, let's not.
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
- I have had.
- I will have.
He's a bit soft that Inspector,
isn't he?
He never takes his hat off.
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
- I'm off.
- Typical!
Kaili!
Argh!
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
The fiends!
Help me!
Help!
He's mine!
Help!
Help me!
There's one on the back,
but it's not the right one.
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
Back up and smash him off.
Now, this will get him!
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
This should give him a headache.
Where's he gone?
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
- Hello.
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
On, on!
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
To the right! oh...
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
On!
Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
- He's got a plan.
- A very famous plan.
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
I've got a plan.
Ringo!
Ringo!
" Ringo!
" Ringo!
" Ringo!
" Ringo!
Ringo!
Ringo!
All right, talk!
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
Alas... Scalpel.
Sea...
Sand in the generator.
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
Fix it, Algernon.
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
Fix it!
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
I've got some juice.
I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
Hands up!
- What's that?
- Distilled from the essence...
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tiberius Foot Juice!
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
The government in the palm of my hand.
What's it say?
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
- I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
- I don't think so.
- Let's get it translated.
<i>' NOW!
" Right!</i>
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
They're quite merciless.
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
Oh, mother Kaili,
whose name is the Terrible...
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
...whose name
is the inaccessible,
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
We turn our hearts to...
No!
...drinker of blood...
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
- There he is!
- It just came off!
Quickly! After them!
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.
Ah... So! Ha!
He who wears the ring...
