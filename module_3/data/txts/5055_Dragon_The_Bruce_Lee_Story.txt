Aaah!
Aaaaah!
Waaooo-waah!
<i>Kung fu is more than
a system of fighting.</i>
<i>It's a system of thought.</i>
<i>You must out-think your opponent,
whatever form he takes,</i>
<i>because some of them
will be more than just men.</i>
<i>What else could it be,</i> sifu?
<i>We all have
inner demons to fight.</i>
<i>We call these demons fear
and hatred and anger.</i>
<i>If you don't conquer them,
then a life of a hundred years</i>
<i>is a tragedy.</i>
<i>If you do,
a life of a single day</i>
<i>can be a triumph.</i>
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry.
Excuse me, my son.
Uh, six pints of beer, mate.
No.
Aw, come on.
Oh, God,
what about that one there?
Hello. Mind if I take over?
Go on, piss off!
Big boy!
Hey, look, I'm Fred Astaire!
She's a bit frisky,
isn't she?
Oh, yeah. Come on, one, two. Oh,
I love it when they fight back.
One, two, come on!
Stay back. Stay back. Back in...
Hey, hey! Back in line.
What do you want?
I want to dance with her.
This one's mine.
Get one of your own.
She is one of my own.
Hyah! Ohhh!
<i>♪ Breeze is soft against my skin</i>
♪ Such sweet-sweet rememberin' ♪
Owoo-waah!
Hold it, lads.
Leave him to me.
Come on, try that again.
I'm gonna get you,
you little yellow bastard.
Smash your face in.
Try it again, huh?
Ooahhhhhh.
Aaah!
Aaaah!
Aaaaah!
Whoooo-ooaah!
Hey, Bob!
Wanna try this?
Okay.
Ba-Ba!
The police were here.
They're looking for you.
I know.
The sailor's in hospital
with a punctured lung.
He might die.
He was making trouble.
He started it.
He's the nephew of the assistant
police inspector of Kowloon.
I can hide out
with my friends.
You don't have
any friends now!
Oww!
The cops will be back.
I should get out of here.
Sit down.
I've thought
a lot about this...
For a very long time.
You'll have to
leave Hong Kong.
For how long?
Forever.
This is a joke, right?
You're joking.
Listen to me, Sai-Fon, you'll
die in Hong Kong. I've seen it.
You're too superstitious,
Ba-Ba.
You're a man now. Almost.
You have a right to know everything.
You had an older brother.
He died in childbirth.
The demon took
him away from us.
The firstborn
man-child is very valuable.
So when you were born, I name
you Sai-Fon, a girl's name.
We dress you in
dresses so the demon
wouldn't know I
had another son.
I made you speak English,
all so we could fool him.
But now he knows.
And he's coming for you.
You must leave tonight.
Where, Ba-Ba? Where can I go?
You love American movies.
You love American cars.
You go to America.
America?
I was in America on tour with the
Canton Opera Company in 1940.
San Francisco.
Doing <i>The Drunken Princess.</i>
November 27th, you were born.
That morning I got you
and three good reviews.
I was very proud.
Come here. Come here.
This
is your birth certificate.
"Bruce Lee."
It sounded very American.
It sure does.
You were born there. Show
this to the immigration man.
They have to let you in.
You need money
to go to America.
It's yours.
I saved it for you
for a day like today.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll do better.
Tell me you'll make a big noise in
America, so I can hear it over here.
No.
Do you speak English?
Yeah.
I'm practicing my English.
Going to America.
I've always wanted
to go to America.
James Dean.
French fries. The sky's the
limit, that's what they say.
Not a Chinaman's chance.
They say that too.
You ever hear that?
No.
You know, the Chinese,
we built the rail roads there.
The Americans, the <i>gwailo</i>,
would lower chinamens
over the cliff in
baskets to set the dynamite.
Get pulled up too slow, bang!
Rope break.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Americans say,
"Not a Chinaman's chance,"
and round-eyed
<i>gwailo</i> would laugh.
We're not human to them.
How do you know?
I'm a history teacher.
Things are different now.
It's today.
Sure, sure. Maybe.
I'm different.
Sure. Sure.
I am. You'll see.
Order, please. One pork lo mein,
one kung pao chicken.
Hey. Hey.
Hi.
My name is April.
Bruce.
I know.
Hey, Lee! Clean up!
Hey, Lee! Clean up!
Lee, clean it up.
Yes, Miss Yang.
Mr. Ho, you're here to cook,
not to make trouble.
Go! Fight!
Win! Go, fight, win!
Hit it! Whoo!
Michael! Come on! Yeah!
You know what Margaret Mead...
Go! Fight! Win!
Go, fight, win! Hit it!

Sit down.
Two weeks' pay.
Two weeks severance.
What's this?
All-purpose loan.
You got a lot of money, Lee.
What you gonna do?
I guess I'd better...
I tell you what to do.
Take April on the town.
Buy her nice clothes.
Check into big hotel.
Have lots of sex.
Have food brought
up to you in bed.
Drink champagne and whisky.
Now money all gone.
April be gone,
too, like money.
You come back to me.
I put you in kitchen,
wash dishes to pay back loan.
By that time you're no longer
young, you're no longer handsome.
You're nothing
but a dishwasher.
That one choice.
There are others.
Like what?
They say education is good.
Hmm.
I've heard that.
Me, personally,
I hope you go with April.
I can always use
a good dishwasher!
Time's up. Come on, man.
I'm not finished yet.
Yeah, you are.
We work out at 3:00.
See that clock?
It's 3:00. Come on.
Where does it say
that in the rule book?
Ooh. The rule book.
You been readin' the wrong rule books.
Read the ones in English.
What's that mean?
See? That's what I mean.
Your kind don't understand English.
My kind?
Yeah.
Gooks, chinks. You guys
killed my dad in Korea.
You think I'm happy
to see you in my gym?
Don't touch me.
Ooooh!
Or what? Huh?
Or I'll touch you back.
Come on, touch me, dink.
Come on.
Come on, touch me, chink.
Come on.
Hit him, Joe.
Quit looking at him
and touch me, chink.
Come on, man.
He's scared of you, man.
Mr. Henderson, we so sorry.
Are you coming?
I have to finish my workout.
Might as well finish on you.
Finish him, Joe.
Okay, chink, let's go.
Ken, Andy, get off the mat!
Go on,
man, I'm gonna kill this guy.
You can take him, Joe.
Wait.
What is this? What are you
gonna do, stink me to death?
Come on! Come on.
Wait. Wait. So sorry.
Oh! What is this,
a fight or a striptease?
Come on! Come on!
Okay, I ready.
Yeah?
Aah!
Very good shadow boxing!
You... Aaaah!
Chinks can jump

Come on, Joe!
Come on.
Come on,

Aaah!
Get up, Joe!
I'll kill you, bastard!
I'm no bastard. I'm Bruce Lee!
Yaaaah!
Yaaah! Ohh! Aah!
Sorry about your father.
That was Koreans.
I'm an American.
You sure showed him,
Henderson!
Yeah, way to go, Joe.
Hey! Ease up, ease up.
We come in peace.
I'm Benny Sayles and
this is Tad Overton.
We just wanna
ask you a question.
That jujitsu stuff.
Can you teach us?
Can anybody do it?
I told you.
It's secret chink stuff.
Aaaaah!
Shit!
You okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
You see that? You see how it flowed?
Be like water.
Water's the softest
stuff in the world,
but it can fit
into any container.
It seems weak,
but it can penetrate rock.
Be like the nature of water.
That's it for today.
Friday we spar, eh?
All right.
All right.
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Linda!
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Um,
is this class only for guys?
'Cause it looks like
you only teach guys.
I teach whoever wants
to learn. Usually guys
are the ones
interested in fighting.
I've dated some
of these animals.
I've done plenty of fighting.
Ha ha.
But seriously,
I'd like to take lessons.
How about Friday? 3:00?
That's a date.
No, that's an appointment.
There's a difference.
See ya, Bruce.
<i>Bye, guys.</i>
Bye, Linda.
Emotion can be the enemy.
If you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.
Be at one with your emotions,
because the body
always follows the mind.
This is not about winning.
This is about perfection.
Then why all
those colored belts?
The only thing belts are good
for is to hold your pants up.
Okay, let's spar, shall we?
Urn, Linda?
Linda and...
Linda and me, I guess.
Come, Linda.
Go get 'em, Linda.
Remember reference? Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Set?
You're open.
I saw it coming.
Uhh!
Yeah!
There you go. You see? It isn't
size or strength that matters.
It's focus. You all have
a chi, an inner spirit.
Focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.
Like you just saw.
Find your reference
points and square off.
Good.
I kinda like this position.
Then say "yes" to a date.
All of us?
No, just you and me.
Why?
Why?
Yeah, why? Why me?
'Cause I already fell for you.

Bye, Mom! I'm going bowling!
I'm not deaf.
I'm sorry.
You're going where?
I'm going bowling.
Have fun. Not too late, now.
Okay. Nope.
Bowling?
For Pete sakes, Emery.
Couldn't you think of something better?
Bowling?
Give me a break, Sherry.

I can't believe you're going
out with a Chinese guy.
Well, let me tell ya, if
you met him, you'd get it.
I don't think I could kiss
somebody who wasn't white.
I... I just don't
think I could do that.
I'll try and live with
that thought. I really will.
You'd kiss him?
Kiss him? At least.
You'd let him put his tongue in your mouth.
A Chinese guy.
Who knows? Maybe more.
You are so low, Emery.
You pretend to be this jock,
but you're a... A beatnik.
Ooh.
Pass me the bongos, daddy-o.
Hi.
You look great.
Thanks. Blue looks good on you.
I'm glad you like it.
You look really good yourself.
I've never seen you
with so many clothes on.
Wanna get a table?
Yeah. Okay.
Lee.
We have reservations at 8:00.
I'm sorry. I don't
have a table right now.
Perhaps you'd like
to sit at the bar.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
A philosophy major. Now what can
you do with a philosophy major?
You can think deep thoughts
about being unemployed.
You're such a good teacher.
Have you ever
thought about
teaching kung fu?
What do you think
I've been doing?
No, but I mean really going for it.
In the American way.
Making a business.
A chain, like McDonald's.
I like teaching, but...
Oh, sure, it's fun to throw
helpless girls on the floor.
Seriously, I like
the way it changes people.
You can't change people with your fists.
I've learned that.
See,
they see something strange,
something they
don't understand,
and they get afraid.
Teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid,
because it's
become part of them.
Well, sometimes strange things
can be very beautiful.
Excuse me.
It's been half
an hour and I still see
people being
seated ahead of us.
Come, don't exaggerate.
It's been barely 20 minutes.
Like to have
our check, please.
I was thinking.
What were you thinking?
I'd like to take
you someplace else,
someplace good.
Thank you.

<i>I lost my key.</i>

<i>You like me. I'm a liked guy.</i>
<i>In 30 seconds,

Let's get out of here.
<i>Don't be angry.
I won't do it again.</i>
<i>If you promise
not to be angry,</i>
<i>I might let you take
those pictures we mentioned.</i>
<i>When?</i>
What is this place?
What are we doing here?
Come on,
be a little adventurous.
Where are you taking me?
Well, what do you think?
I don't know what to think.
What do you
mean you don't know
what to think?
This was your idea.
My idea, to move
into an industrial slum?
This is no slum!
This is the first Bruce
Lee Kung Fu Institute.
You talked me into it.
You make me feel
like I can do anything.
You can.
When I came over on the boat, I
knew this was an "idea" place.
Ideas make this country great.
Here a good
idea makes a man
anything he wants to be.
You drop a pebble in a pond,
you get ripples.
Soon the ripples
cross the whole pond.
Come here.
Drop it.
See, it's begun.

One! Two! Three!
One! Two! Three!
One! Two! Three!
One! Two! Three!
What is wrong with you today?
You're acting so funny.
Hmm?
Well, I gotta go.
I told Mom I'd
help her with dinner.
Your mother must think you're
a professional bowler by now.
I'm gonna tell her.
When?
When I'm ready.
Are you ashamed?
Are you ashamed
you wanna marry a Chinaman?
No, I'm not ashamed.
Are you ashamed of me? Did you
tell your father about me?
Did you tell him about
your little <i>gwailo</i> girl?
Yes.
What did he say?
Doesn't matter what he said.
What matters is I told him.
Okay.
Okay.
I'm gonna tell her.
She's just not
gonna understand, Bruce.
Sugar, Mr. Lee?
Please.
Cream?
No.
How many sugars?
Just one.
Linda,
you want some coffee, too?
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Cookie?
No.
Are you pregnant?
No.
Okay. Okay.
Let's look at this from all angles.
How will you live?
I'm opening a school in Oakland.
Maybe one in Palo Alto.
Soon it'll become
a chain like McDonald's.
I don't wanna rain on
your parade, Mr. Lee,
but the world
needs hamburgers.
It doesn't need judo.
Kung fu.
Whatever.
More and more people
are studying it all the time.
That's howl put
myself through school.
Okay, I'll give you that.
So let's get down to
the real issue, children.
After all, Linda, that's what
marriage is really about, children.
We wanna have children,
someday.
Ah. But what will they be?
They won't be white
and they won't be oriental.
They'll be some
kind of half-breed,
and they won't be
accepted by either side.
They'll be American. Linda's
American, I'm American.
You're an American citizen.
You're not really an American.
Bruce.
You'd better put
a Band-Aid on that cut.
Bruce. Bruce!
I spoke to him like a gentleman.
You heard me.
My favorite china.
Mom...
You can do better than that.
Believe me,
you'll forget
about him in a month.
Do you really wanna
have yellow babies?
Can you imagine that,
yellow babies?
Yes, I can.
Oh, Linda.
All this will do is bring you pain.
Linda, listen to me.
I can't allow it. I'm sorry,
but I can't allow it.
It's not up to you.
Linda...
Mom, it's not up to you!
Linda!
Linda! Linda!
Stop! Wait!
No! No! no!
Bruce!
Bruce!
What's this?
All-purpose loan.
Where're you going?
To a wedding!
Hi, honey!
Hi, hon.
Anything?
Not yet.
What are you doing?
Just giving
the place a little blessing.
Well, we don't need a blessing
because we've got advertising.
You open?
Come in, come in.
Caught the flyer.
Thought I'd check it out.
See?
Seen some of them
chop-socky flicks, man.
Some cool shit.
Name's Jerome. Jerome Sprout.
Bruce Lee. My wife, Linda.
Hey.
Hi, Jerome.
I'd like to take some lessons.
I like to give them.
Solid. Now,
you know I'm not Chinese?
I've noticed that.
Some of them other Chinese teachers,
man, they turn me down flat.
Some of 'em wouldn't
even let me in the door.
You got yourself a teacher.
I can dig it, man.
You got yourself a student.
Keep repeating it. Now backwards.
Go for a switch.
Like that?
Yeah. Yeah.
We're gonna speed up a little bit.
All right, ready?
Oh! Whoop!
One! Two! One!
Two! One! Two!
One! Two! One! Two!
One! Two! One! Two! One!
One! Two! One! Two!
Thank you.
One! Two! One! Two!
Bruce. I know you
like to be called Bruce.
You've been charged with
violating the martial arts code.
We've had several
complaints from Wu Zuolin
and Wong Jack Man
and many others.
You've been teaching the <i>gwailo</i>.
This must stop.
I'll teach
whoever wants to learn.
Bruce, we do
things differently here.
One of the things we do not do is
teach our secrets to whites, blacks.
They are the enemy.
They are not the enemy.
They just don't know us.
We've been so
closed for so long,
they've never seen the real
beauty of our culture.
Let's show it to them.
No. No. No.
I'm sorry. We do not agree. You are
ordered to stop teaching the <i>gwailo</i>.
Or what?
Or we will
settle this by combat.
Prepare yourself.
Not hungry?
Nah.
You canceled all
your classes today.
I had to take care
of some business.
What business?
Oh, nothing much.
Tax stuff.
I better get going.
There's something
you're not telling me.
Do we owe a lot of money?
I owe everything...
To you.
See you.
What'd you find out?
Bookies are laying
20-to-1 against you.
Who is this guy?
Johnny Sun. He's got a school on Thompson.
He's a killer, man.
What are you,
his press agent?
He's a real killer.
A couple of brothers
tried to rob him last year.
One went to a hospital. One with
a gun went to a funeral home.
You're a real
confidence builder, Jerome.
Man, they eat their
Wheaties in that family.
Tiny there's his
younger brother Luke.
Bruce,
forget about this stuff.
Forget about all us <i>gwailo</i> and let's
get the hell outta here right now.
Do you give up?
Do you give up?
Do you give up?
I give up. I give up.
I give up.
Right on!
I teach who I want.
The decision is mine.
<i>Dr. Craig and Dr. Donan,</i>
<i>come to the hospital
administration office.</i>
<i>Dr. Craig and Dr. Donan,
to the hospital administration office.</i>
Mrs. Lee, I'm Dr. Arlo.
How is he? Is he okay?
Let's not talk in here.
Is he okay?
There are some
papers to sign, Mrs. Lee.
Mrs. Lee.
Huh?
Some... There are
some papers. Some papers.
You know,
this thing's kinda sexy.
Maybe we can keep it
after you're better.
I'm sorry.
It was a bad joke.
I know you're mad. Don't be mad.
It'll only make things worse.
Worse? Couldn't take a hell of
a lot to make things worse.
You should've told me
where you were going.
Why?
Because I'm your wife, that's why!
I had a right to know.
You might wanna think about that.
The wife part, I mean.
What're you saying?
Take a good look
at me, Linda.
So we've got a little trouble.
This is more than
a little trouble!
Okay,
so we've got big trouble!
You're always going on about the
beauties of your Chinese culture!
Let me tell you
about the beauties
of my culture!
We love big trouble!
That's what you say now!
In six months,
you'll be looking
for the back door!
Oh, no, it's never
gonna be over
between you and me!
You get it?
Go back to your mother, Linda!
I'm finished!
Tell her I made
a mistake. Do it!
You hear me? Tell her you made a mistake!
Don't touch me!
I don't want you here!
I don't want you! Get out! Go!
Leave me alone!
Don't look at me like that!
Who is it? Who's there?
Who is it?
Who's there?
Hi. I thought I'd
improve the view.
Oh,
look at the big kung fu man.
First sign of trouble
and all he does is quit.
Shut up! Shut up!
See this notebook? Looks like the
ones we had in school, right?
Wrong. This is your future.
I don't have any more future.
Sure, you do.
You know, all I keep hearing
is the fight took too long.
Too much tradition,
too much classical mess,
too many fixed
positions in Wing Chun.
You know everything
that's wrong, so fix it.
Stop whining and
start fighting.
Fight back with your mind.
I can't write, I can't move!
You talk, quitter. I'll write.
I'm waiting.
It would take forever.
You goin' anywhere?
I'm not.
Oh, yeah,
there's just one more thing.
I'm pregnant.
The great mistake is to anticipate
the outcome of the engagement.
You ought not to be thinking of
whether it ends in victory or defeat,
but let nature
take its course,
and your tools will
strike at the right moment.
<i>The consciousness of self
is the greatest hindrance</i>
<i>to the proper
execution of all...</i>
<i>The knowledge and skill you have achieved
are meant to be forgotten.</i>
<i>So you can float...</i>
<i>To obtain
enlightenment in martial art</i>
<i>means the extinction
of everything which...</i>
<i>The way to transcend karma lies in the
proper use of the mind and the will.</i>
<i>Jeet kune do is not to hurt,</i>
<i>but is one of the avenues through

Relaxation is essential for faster
and more powerful punching.
Let your lead punch
shoot up loosely and...
And what? "Loosely and" what?
Loosely and easily!
"Easily." okay.
Do not tighten up
or clench your fists
until the moment of impact.
Aah! Aah.
Okay, come on. Come on.
All punches should end
with a snap several inches
behind the target.
Okay.
Morning, ladies!
Congratulations, Mr. Lee.
Thank you.
Yaaoow-toh-unh! Wah!
Hey, kiddo.
He's too young to shave.
They aren't shaving mirrors.
They're called <i>pat kwa</i>.
<i>Pat kwa?</i>
They're like
gargoyles on churches.
You put them around to
ward off evil spirits.
I wanna call him Brandon.
Brandon.
That's good.
Do you wanna hold him?
Oh, look at daddy.
Hey, big guy.
Come on up here. Shh!
He's so tiny.
Hi, baby.
Don't be afraid.
He's so tiny.
You're beautiful.
Bruce?
Bruce, come here! It came!
Yeah?
Look! It's here,
it's here, it's here!
Oh.
Open it! Open it up quick!
Whoa!
It's your book!
It's your book.
Look at that.
Okay, hold on. I'll get it.
Hi.
May I come in?
Why?
I like your hair.
Come on, Mom, I don't
wanna chitchat with you.
What are you doing here?
I came to see you and...
Did you come to see me,
or did you come to
see the yellow baby?
I think maybe I
made a mistake.
Brandon, it's Grandma!
Grandma's come to see you!
Come on in, Grandma!
There's someone
you ought to meet.
Come on.
How are you feeling, Mr. Lee?
Oh, like half-man, half-car.
Glad to hear it.
Linda, your mom's got
great legs. Great legs!
He looks...
Well, he...
He looks like both of you.
May I?
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
There you go.
Hello. Yes.
You're such a handsome fellah.
He's gorgeous.
He's so sweet.
Oh, yes, you are.
You did good, sweetheart.
You sure did good. Gosh, yes.
Look at you!
Brandon, you're a strong one.
Only you could do this.
<i>The art of jeet kune do
is simply to simplify.</i>
<i>It favors formlessness so
that it can assume all forms.</i>
<i>Kung fu, karate, tae kwan do.</i>
<i>All the classical
styles are attempts</i>
<i>to arrest
the flux of conflict.</i>
<i>But in actual combat, the opponent
doesn't wait for formalities.</i>
<i>He's not a robot, but a human being,
fluid and alive.</i>
<i>For instance... For instance!</i>
<i>Like a sculptor who doesn't
keep adding clay to a statue,</i>

<i>I have developed a way of

<i>The fancy mess of martial arts
solidifies what was once fluid.</i>
<i>It is nothing but blind devotion

Calm down!
<i>Calm down! Calm down!</i>
Tell him to prove it!
Yeah!
Tell him to prove it!
<i>Mr. Lee is not
here for competition.</i>
Prove it!
Prove it!
<i>All right, calm down, calm down!</i>
<i>Keep it quiet! Mr. Lee...</i>
Prove it! Prove it!
Prove it! Prove it!
<i>Okay!</i>
<i>Okay, I'll prove it.</i>
<i>I'll need
someone to prove it on.</i>
<i>I'll beat any man in
this room in 60 seconds!</i>
What?
I'll fight him!
I beat him before!
I beat him again!
What are you, crazy? The
doctor said no more fighting.
They told me I'd
never walk again, too.
When will you be happy?
When they're right?
Bruce, I'm begging you.
If you love me...
This isn't about you and me.
Fine!
But I'm not going through this
again, do you understand me?
You get hurt,
you're on your own.
Don't go too far, hon!
It'll be over in 60 seconds.
<i>This is a challenge match</i>
<i>to prove Mr. Lee's
theories on jeet kune do.</i>
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>
Bow to the judges.
Bow to each other.
Begin!
Yaaaaaah!
Woo-aaahh!
Jeez! Jeez!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Yeah!
Hey, Mr. Lee!
Bill Krieger's the name. You looked
pretty great out there today.
No, he didn't. He was too slow.
He took too long.
You looked pretty fast to me.
You think you can do some of
that stuff in front of a camera?
I'm a TV producer and...
Right, and I'm Marvin Gaye.
I'm casting my new series.
It's called The Green Hornet,
and I think we could use you.
So, d'you hear I bought
a house on the beach?
Right in Malibu.
I'm tellin' ya,
I got 120 yards of
sand as my front yard.
That's too tight.
I can sell the stunt.
You don't have to cut
off the circulation.
Cal, run him
through the scene.
As soon as you get your cue light,
you come through that door.
Then you work your way
down this catwalk here.
Be real careful as you
negotiate this corner.
I want you to get down these
steps as fast as you can.
Not too fast.
I don't want you to tumble. I don't
want to lose you on the first show.
When you get to this landing,
do you think you could take
these five steps all at once?
I'll try.
Atta boy.
First positions, everybody!
Hey, can you tell it's me?
I just talked to the network.
They love the dailies. They love 'em.
Don't they always?
Yeah. Listen, there's, uh...
There's one small problem.
Lemme call you back.
Yeah, what is it?
Uh, it's this guy Lee.
You know, he's awfully...
Oriental.
He's supposed to be oriental.
Yeah.
He's playing an oriental.
I know, I know. What?
Kato is oriental.
I know, I know.
Uh, can you just make sure
he keeps the mask on?
Roll sound! Roll camera!
And mark it!
Action!
All right, Green Hornet,
where's the secret formula?
Where it belongs.
Okay, have it your way.
Kato!
Good work, Kato!
Ow! Ow!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Good work, Kate.
Thanks, boss.
Huh? Ah, cut, cut, cut!
That's a print.
Thought that'd be
a little more exciting.
If he came from Hong Kong,
he'd end up in San Francisco.
I don't wanna do the urban thing.
We helped with the rail roads.
How about the Wild West?
Okay, great. The Wild West.
Okay.
Chinese immigrant
wanders the land.
He's a good guy, a hero.
Of course he's a hero.
He's the star of the show.
He wanders
the land solving problems.
Every week he
solves a problem.
With no gun. Just his hands.
That's good.
That's great. No gun.
He's looking for something.
His father. He lost his
father who came ahead of him.
No, no, not the father.
The father thing has been done to death.
He's searching
for his brother.
Good.
Searching for his brother.
He never finds him.
Not until the fifth year.
He wanders the land,
searching for his brother,
solving problems with no gun.
And he has something
no one else has ever seen.
<i>Kung Fu!</i> Starring Bruce Lee.
<i>Kung Fu!</i> Uh-huh.
He remembers
what he was taught
in the old
country by his teacher,
and teaches
people his culture.
After he's kicked the shit
out of everybody. Fantastic!
We've got action, culture!
It's a western!
But it's an eastern.
It's an eastern.
Right. It's an eastern.
They're gonna love it. This
thing's gonna run forever!
<i>- Kung Fug
- Kung Fu!</i>
Easy, easy.
Wow.
You steal Steve McQueen's car?
He stole mine.
Come on, get in. We're late.
Okay.
What? Linda. Hey.
I...
You do the clutch,
I'll work the stick.

Excuse me.
Did I ever tell you I was the
cha-cha champion of Hong Kong?
About 15,000 times.
Did I ever tell
you I was pregnant?
Once.
Make that twice.
Hold it, everybody! Hold it!
Hold it!
I know the timing
is lousy, but, uh,
I wanted you to hear it
first from me personally.
The show's been canceled.
What?
Oh, no.
I know it's a bummer, but we'll
finish out the last episodes,
and, uh, that'll be that.
I'm sorry.
Enjoy the rest of the party.
Bill and I will
just roll into <i>Kung Fu!</i>
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
One, two, cha-cha-cha. One
and two and three and four.
And one and two and three and four.
One, two, cha-cha-cha.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
So what are they saying at
the network about <i>Kung Fu</i>?
Right.
And when do you
think they'll know?
Oh, Bill, Bill, Bill.
What about dinner?
Call me back.
They still haven't made
any decisions on the show.
Still looks good.
Good.
Don't worry.
Who else are they
gonna get, Mickey Rooney?
I'm not worried.
I'm not worried.
Hello?
Really?
<i>As quickly as you can,</i>
<i>snatch the pebble from my hand.</i>
All right.
Okay.
<i>When you can take
the pebble from my hand,</i>
<i>it will be time
for you to leave.</i>
What's wrong, honey?
My father's dead.
<i>It comes, it goes.</i>
<i>In your dream?</i>
<i>No, I'm always awake.
It's not a dream,</i> sifu.
When your father first brought
you here, he told me everything.
He wanted you to
learn wing chun
to protect
yourself against man
and other forces.
I thought that was
all superstition.
Superstition is a name the
ignorant give to their ignorance.
You were special then,
and you're special now.
That's why
the demon wants you.
We have spent a lot of time
together, preparing you for this.
Good. Good.
Very good.
What if I won't fight him?
You have no choice.
You're fighting for
more than yourself.
What are you saying, <i>sifu</i>?
As I told you, this
demon is your inner fear.
It doesn't matter how
many men you defeat.
If you don't
conquer your own fears,
you will pass your demons
on to your children,
as your father
passed his on to you.
No.
You will fight him.
When you are at
your absolute peak,
he will come to you.
When the monsoon blow,
be prepared.
Mr. Lee! Mr. Lee!
I've been chasing
you all over Hong Kong.
You should buy a car.
Just a joke.
I'm Philip Tan.
I'm a producer. I want to
make a picture with you.
Talk is cheap.
Pictures are expensive.
I'm on the level.
You're Kato, and over here, Kato
has a small but loyal following.
They don't call your show <i>The Green Hornet</i>.
It's called <i>The Karo Show</i>.
Did you know that?
Well, it's true.
When I hear Kato is in town,
I consider it a good omen.
I've got to get
back to my family.
Leave tomorrow.
I've been away for so long.
I'll buy you a new ticket,
first class.
I'll take care of everything.
One more day, please.
You can't lose.
What's the movie?
Action! Action!
Action!
My brother can't talk right.
He can't walk right.
You have dishonored my family.
I have sworn to kill you.
Swearing is easy.
I read your book.
I know all your tricks.
Let's see how well
you've learned your lesson.
Haaah!
Waah! Waah!
Aah! Aaaaah!
Aaah!
Yaaaah!
Yaaaaaah!
It's so hot in here, I like to put
my dolly in the refrigerator.
Yeah, that was fun!
We missed you!
I missed you too!
I missed you.
I missed you!
<i>Listen, Cheng, give up.</i>
<i>Cheng!</i>
<i>Ohh!</i>
<i>It's okay, Mei.</i>
Let's get out of here
before they lynch us.
Yeah! Hey!
Bruce!
Linda!
Bruce!
Bruce!
Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee!
Daddy's taking
me to the circus!
Oh, my.
Okay, Brandon, go change.
Don't keep daddy waiting.
Okay!
Okay, back!
Back! Number two. Number two.
It's okay.
Come on, big boy.
Come on.
Your bed is so much more cozy.
Come on.
We'll go up to your bed with
the covers and everything.

Wanna try?
Uh, no thanks.
You might turn it up
and try to electrocute me.
The thought crossed my mind.
Justifiable homicide,
some might say.
What do you want, Bill?
You didn't come here
to discuss old times.
I came to discuss new times.
There's somebody I want you to meet.
His name is Freddie Weintraub.
We've got a project for you.
What's the matter,
David Carradine turn you down?
No, Fred's got a script.
It's called Enter the Dragon.
We're gonna shoot it here, but
it's your ticket back to America.
It's a feature.
A Hollywood feature.
With all the trimmings. Hmm?
Hey!
It's okay.
I'm awake.
<i>I was working
on Game of Death.</i>
Lost track of time.
The kids okay?
Don't you ever get tired
of asking that question?
Linda, we've been
through this before.
I don't have a choice.
You might not,
but I do.
I'm taking the kids
and going home for a while.
Home's here for now.
No. Here is where
we watch you work.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to come with us.
Forget it.
I worked in America for 10 years
and what did it get me?
It got me nothing.
It got you me.
Oh, man.
They got such
a good line of bullshit.
"Come and get it!" "America,
the mountain of gold!"
"It's for everybody!"
Yeah, it's for everybody white!
But they don't tell you that!
You gotta read the small print!
If you can read.
I am not America.
Your kids are not America.
Don't push us away.
We're going.
I want you to come with us.
I want the kids to
have a father again.
Don't lay any
guilt trips on me!
I'm not taking
any guilt trips!
This place is eating us up!
Can't you see that, Bruce?
This place has
given us a life!
I'm somebody here!
I'm special!
Back there,
I'm just another gook!
Just another wetback, Charlie Chan,
slopehead, coolie dishwasher
in a stinking
chinkie restaurant!
Mom!
Starch your shirt, mister white man?
Please? No tickee, no shirtee!
Order one from column "a"
and one from column "b."
Mommy!
Me happy to
build the rail roads,
to dig the mines for you,
mister white man!
Yooaaaahhh!
Mommy, I'm scared!
What's happening?
Is that who I am?
Is it? Tell me!
Tell me that's who I am!
I don't know who
the hell you are anymore!
Do you?
Mommy, what's happening?
Weintraub's script is called Enter the Dragon.
I read it. It's really good.
I thought we were partners.
I made you my partner!
We are partners!
I told him
without you, no deal.
"A co-production in
association with Philip Tan"?
That's an insult!
You could get more.
It's not about getting more.
We don't need them!
Yes, we do.
It's Warner Brothers,
big budget, in English,
with
international distribution!
Don't sell me, Bruce!
Don't sell a salesman!
Do you have an aspirin?
I don't know, man.
I don't know
how much longer I
can keep this up.
You want it so bad, don't you?
You want their love so bad.
Our love's not
good enough for you.
When I was a kid,
I had all these crazy ideas.
I wanted to show the world the beauty
of our culture, to give them a hero.
But a Chinese hero.
You have.
Don't you see that?
I want something else now.
I want to stop
breaking my wife's heart.
I want to play
with my children
without having to
look at the clock.
They're American.
I need to get back to
America or I'll lose them.
If I lose them,
nothing means anything.
Aah!
Aaaah!
Aaaaah!
Look!
Nooo!
Nooooooo!
Daddy! Dad!
Dad, come home! Dad!
Brandon, run!
Run, Brandon!
Run, Brandon! Go!
Dad! Come on, Dad!
Brandon, run!
Aaah!
Dad! Dad, he's coming! Dad!
Come on, Dad!
Dad, he's coming!
Dad!
It's okay, Brandon! It's okay!
Dad!
Now, Brandon, now! Now! Run!
Aaaaaaaaaah!
Kind of lost you there for
a minute, bud. You okay?
Bruce? You all right?
You all right?
Dad! What are you doing here?
I live here.
Hey, can I play with you guys?
Sure.
Daddy, we had a typhoon.
I know.
But it's over now.
Okay, Dad, I'll be the engineer,
you be the switcher.
Hey, that sounds great.
Last shot.
Make it great.
Linda, I forgot something.
What?
I forgot to tell
you I love you.
You know, I don't think you've
ever said that to me before.
Yeah,
but I meant it every day.
Three weeks before the
opening of Enter the Dragon,
<i>the film that brought
him international fame,</i>
<i>Bruce fell into
a mysterious coma and died.</i>
<i>He was 32.</i>
<i>Over 25,000 people attended
his funeral in Hong Kong,</i>
<i>but I buried him back home in
America to be close to us.</i>
<i>All these years later, people still
wonder about the way he died.</i>
<i>I prefer to
remember the way he lived.</i>
