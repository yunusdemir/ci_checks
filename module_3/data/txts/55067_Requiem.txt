John Dee was a scryer. He thought
he was talking to angels.
You can only hear their voices if you're
pure of heart, like a small child.
The dog found something,
a child's bones.
You're saying Carys is dead.
There was a bracelet on the wrist.
What if there were two children?
What if they took two?
I feel like there's something in me.
I'm scared of what I'm going to see.
It says the name of a real
hospital, a real doctor,
a real mother and father.
That's not me. Mother, Janice Gray.
Why are doing this?
If you won't stop this, I will.
You're saying that she
arrived in the area a few
months before Carys went missing,
and then she disappeared?
Can you just tell me
he's all right? No sign of a driver.
It seems like your friend's
disappeared.
Let me out!
Let me out! Carys, hey! It's OK.
I told you I'd be right back.
Come on, Carys. I got you sweets.
Where am I? I want my mummy!
I want to go home.
All the ones you wanted.
I want my mummy!
I've done the mirrors, covered them
up. Just like you said.
I want my mummy!
Carys! Shh.
You have got to quieten down.
Or you'll get us both killed.
Do you understand?
Good girl. Now, do you remember
what I told you? We need to hide.
Because those people back here,
they are bad people.
And if those bad people find us,
they are going to do
bad things to us.
Do you understand? Yeah?
OK? We've got a long drive.
Best get going. OK?
He can't have just disappeared.
Straight to voicemail.
Maybe it's switched off. Police
said that he had been to Manchester.
If he went all the way there,
then he must have tried to call me.
I could check in the car, maybe
it's under the seats. Find phone.
I'll do find phone. What?
It's an app, Hal put it on my iPad
and it sets off an alarm
on your phone.
I know what is, but that only works
when the phone is switched on,
doesn't it?
I don't know.
It's worth trying, isn't it?
It's here. What? Oh!
It was just there.
I looked there,
like five minutes ago.
It was right down,
beneath the cushion.
'Message received today at 11:42am.'
'Tilly, I know you're angry with me,
'but I've dug up some
stuff about your dad.
'And just call me as soon as
you can, it's important.'
'Next new message.
You need to pick up, Tilly.
'Your mum, Janice - you were right.
'She wasn't your mum, she was a cop.
Mary McKeown.
'She changed her name and took
the identity of a dead woman
'and I think she took you.
'I don't know why or what's going
on, but I am heading back now.
'For God's sake, Matilda, call me
when you can.
'End of messages.'
What did he say? Nick.
Did you have my phone?
No. I... Whatever Hal said,
whatever that is, it's not true.
You did, you took my phone.
Why the fuck did you do that?
I'm sorry.
Why?
They told me to watch you.
Jesus. You're in on it.
No.
You lied to me! I didn't mean to,
I was just trying to...
You lied to me!
I didn't mean to,
I just wanted to get my money and
they said they would sort it out
if I cooperated, and then Meredith
died and I didn't expect her to die!
I just wanted my money.
So, they killed Meredith?
Who?
Sylvia? The Satlows?
They'll know if I say something.
They'll know. Where's Hal?
I don't know. Tell me. I don't know.
Please, I just...
All I do know is that they
are planning something tonight,
something big. Something bad.
Is Graves in on this?
I don't think so. Then you're
going to come with me. No.
And you're going to tell her
what you know. No, no!
They'll set those things on to her,
they'll kill her.
I've seen what they can do. My
uncle, your mum, Meredith, now Hal.
Are you saying that
they've killed Hal?
I don't know. Are you?
You have to tell me!
Matilda, you've got to just
keep your voice down.
They could be listening.
If they do, they will hear us and...
Jesus!
Sean...
How did this happen?
I did this. I did this.
No. I stabbed you.
It was them, riding you.
Listen, Carys. The thin ones
came again.
And they told me you've got to go.
Back home, right now, this minute.
I'm not going anywhere.
There's something out here.
Not like the thin ones.
Something different.
It means you harm.
I won't leave you. And I won't
leave Hal. Then you'll die.
That's what they told me.
If you stay, you're going to die.
We need an ambulance. Nick! Nick!
Shit.
Sorry, love.
I didn't want to interrupt you,
but the constable...has some news.
About your English friend?
We met for coffee. Thank you.
Just before he had his accident?
He was asking about an old copper,
thought she might be involved in the
Carys Howell business. Involved?
How? I don't think he knew himself.
I said I would try to find out what
became of her, other than that...
And he seemed OK. Sober?
He was worried about his friend,
Matilda.
Otherwise perfectly normal.
We had a bit of drama last night,
up at Dean House.
From what I hear, Eddie Fenton
and Aron Morgan have been bad boys.
We had a chat, Eddie and me,
about the night Ewan died.
He puts you there.
Does he?
Explain that to me, Stephen.
Ewan and I went back 30 years.
He was a good man.
Served this community...
I don't give a shit about that.
I need you to tell me, were you
involved in that drug cultivation?
I was not.
I knew Ewan had his vices.
I didn't think it fair
his reputation be destroyed
over drugs he might be holding,
for personal use. Personal use?
That's what I expected to find.
In any event, when I got the call
saying he was dead, I headed over.
To...clean up the house before
the emergency services arrived.
A call from Aron Morgan?
So, Morgan calls you,
says there's a dead man
and you don't ask any questions
about what Morgan's doing there?
He was doing me a favour by calling
me. I returned it by not prying.
And in doing so, you turned a blind
eye to a major drug cultivation.
Grown on your watch,
officer, not mine.
Don't be hard on yourself.
If we arrested everyone in town
who was breaking the law,
half of Penllynith would be banged
up. We both know the game.
I know the game
because you taught me.
But now I've had enough.
PC Graves.
Come on, now. No, please, please!
I don't want it.
I don't need the medicine!
Please! You don't understand!
You don't understand!
Calm down. They're on it again!
You've got to listen to me, please!
You were right. It's Sean Howell.
I've been right
about a lot of things.
OK, I'm listening.
There are people in this village,
a cult or a coven or...
I don't know.
I don't know what,
but the Satlows are in on it
and so is Sylvia Walsh.
Those reel-to-reel recordings
up at Dean House, and the mirror,
they use them for their ceremonies.
And I think they also use children.
You're talking about Carys Howell.
They got hold of another one,
before.
They adopted him from his drug
addicted mum,
and I don't know what they did,
but he turned up dead
and then they took Carys.
OK. And now your mate, Mr Fine?
They shut him up because he found
out something about Janice.
He sent me pictures,
newspaper articles.
Look.
That's her.
She was a policewoman.
And then she disappeared
and she changed her name
and she left her whole life behind.
Now, why would she do that to me?
Explain that.
The Satlows are good people,
they're solid.
Yeah, they're so bloody solid
that no-one ever looks at them.
All right, let's take a look.
You stay back here
unless I call you in, all right?
Did you know that she...?
Matilda.
Where's Hal?
PC Graves was telling me
about your friend. I'm sorry.
If you have hurt him, I will kill
you. I scarcely met the poor man.
She's lying. You must be able to
see that!
OK. Let's keep this civil.
Apparently you also think I had
something to do with
Carys going missing?
You took me from my real mum.
Matilda! Away from my family.
I was doing a shift at the hospital
when Carys disappeared,
I clearly remember...
Then your husband took me!
Matilda, may I ask have you been
taking the medication I prescribed?
I think it would be enormously
beneficial if you did.
David? They've got David Morgan
in there. That's right.
Stephen Kendrick asked us
to mind him.
We need to get him out of there.
Matilda, the boy looks fine. David!
Come back! Excuse me!
Matilda! David, we need to go.
We can go to the hospital
and we can see your mum.
I'm warning you to step away.
Let go of the boy! You're crazy1
Hey, what the hell is going on?
I hate you!
They are going to kill him.
I know it.
Step back from that child or
I will restrain you. No! No!
You can't have him. Drop that!
You said you would listen to me.
David, come here.
I can't believe I listened to you.
They will hurt him.
Something is going to happen.
You're a danger to this child
and you're a danger to yourself.
You've got to listen!
You're not listening to me!
Matilda Gray, I'm arresting you...
These people are killers!
I know what they are planning.
..harm your defence, if you fail to
mention...
You've got to listen to me!
..Anything you do say may be
given in evidence.
I said some hard things to him
before he went to Manchester.
And now I feel like a right bitch.
What if he doesn't come back?
Can I sit with you?
Till the police call?
Inspector. Not any more, lad.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Mr Kendrick.
So... I heard your boss
arrested Miss Gray.
Yeah, she had been troubling young
Davy Morgan again, so...
Excuse me.
Penllynith Police.
Constable Shortly speaking.
OK, wait, wait. Calm down.
And you can still hear them now?
Right,
you must ring 999 immediately.
Yes, we are the closest station,
but... Constable? One moment, ma'am.
What's wrong? It's a lady
at the top of the Monmieth Road.
Says someone's trying to break
into the back of her house.
Well, get up there, man!
I can't leave a prisoner unattended.
I'll attend.
It's not procedure.
You want to risk it?
I'll get on dispatch,
I'll get backup to Monmieth Road,
you'll be back here in 30 minutes.
Madam? Lock yourself
in the bathroom. I'll be there soon.
Thank you, Inspector.
You're welcome. Now move!
What's going on?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Power's gone.
So is the CCTV.
We're in luck.
Shortly's out, but he won't be
long. We've got to be quick.
What are you doing?
Matilda, I need your help
and I don't have anyone else to ask.
Please. David's in danger.
I know where he'll be.
We need to go to Dean House.
Coming.
Hello? We had a call-out. Oh, yeah?
Someone trying to force entry?
Not here. 52 Monmeith Road?
I spoke to an older lady.
This is 52
but there's no lady here.
Ah, just a crank call, then,
I expect.
Must've been, I suppose.
Sorry to bother you.
All right, Ben, all right.
Benny! Benny!
Stand up.
Stand up or I will shoot.
Verity Satlow treated Rose through
her depression. They were close.
So, when the Satlows called up
and offered to mind David...
You thought you could go down the
pub. I thought I could visit my son.
He hasn't got long.
I don't understand why you suddenly
believe me about all of this.
I spoke to your friend Hal.
What?
He asked me about a police officer
on the Carys Howell task force,
Mary McKeown.
Janice.
I remember Mary, and I started
wondering if she might have
figured this whole thing out.
No. She kidnapped me.
What if she rescued you?
If she figured out where
they had you
and snatched you away to save you?
She would have told someone.
She'd have told Rose at least.
Maybe she didn't know
who she could trust.
Those photos that she had of Rose.
She thought Rose was in on it.
And that's why she couldn't
give me back.
Easy mistake to make.
You made it yourself, didn't you?
If she found out what
they have been doing,
she would have been terrified.
Enough to hide,
and stay hidden for 23 years.
Maybe she actually saved your life,
Matilda.
Best not to let them know
we're coming.
If Mary was a policewoman
based around here,
you would have been her boss.
But you're saying
she never confided in you.
She did, didn't she?
I'd been warned about her.
She was a wild card, a troublemaker,
so, at the time, what she said
about people doing magic, it sounded
like the rantings of a mad woman.
Well, she was right.
She was right,
and she saved me from them.
I told you I've made mistakes.
Now I'm trying to make up for them.
Let's walk from here.
It's only half a mile up the road.
Nice to see you here at HQ, Graves.
Are they putting something
in the water in Penllynith? Sorry?
You've been having your own
mini crimewave.
Maybe I'm just catching them
faster.
Happy for you to have a casual chat.
If you want to make it official,
give me a shout and I'll sit in.
I want Kendrick.
What? I know he was there at
Dean House the night Ewan Dean died.
All I need to do
is connect him to the drugs.
I expect there's hard men
involved in this drug deal of yours.
But do you really think they will
care if you drop an ex-copper in it?
What I'll guarantee you is this.
You'll get a big
discount on your sentence
if you help put a crooked police
officer away.
Helps you, helps me.
Helps your boy. So, I'll ask again.
Was Stephen Kendrick involved in the
cultivation
in the property adjacent
to Dean House? Not to my knowledge.
So why was he there?
I don't know. He just showed up.
And I thought I was a goner.
Old copper on the scene.
But, no, he said to me, "If I don't
see you, you don't see me."
Ed said he was cleaning up. He was.
But it wasn't drugs,
it was broken glass.
The way I see it,
Ewan Dean had been going about
smashing up all the mirrors.
Did Kendrick say anything about it?
No. Tell you the truth,
he looked scared.
At least until he turned
that damn noise off
and then he just calmed down again.
Noise? Music. If that's
what you want to call out.
If you were bloody Igor!
Sent a shiver down my spine.
But you know, each to his own.
'This is Constable Ian Shortly.
'Please leave a message
and I will get back to you.'
Ian, I need to talk to Matilda Gray.
I'm heading back into town
but it's urgent, so call me back.
That Sylvia Walsh's car.
And the Satlows, they're here.
This isn't right. Davie needs us.
I'm not going to wait.
Tilly.
Tilly.
Matilda.
Let's be friends.
At first, I was running.
Trying not to think
about what would happen.
And then, one day, you were crying
again. You cried so much back then.
And I... I lost it.
I gave you a shake.
And at that moment, I could see how
frightened you were.
Of me.
But still, later that night...
..you came into my bed...
and you cuddled up to me,
to the scary lady,
who'd shaken you.
It's not something I asked for,
to be a mum.
And you didn't ask
for me, either, I know.
But you got me.
And I did love you.
I love my clever little girl.
Did you love me, Tilly?
Even a bit?
What are you doing?
The trap door down to the basement,
it's standing open.
Light.
There's a door here. What?
And here you are.
At last.
It's OK. Where's Davey?
Upstairs, asleep, safe.
This was never about him.
Get out of my way!
I will. Just calm down first.
I'm sorry.
It was important you came
of your own will...
..with pure heart.
To save the child.
That's why things didn't
work out properly last time.
When you were little.
Pure of heart, you were.
But not here willingly.
Now we can put that right.
Put that right?
You've killed people, children.
You sent those things
to kill my mother.
That woman wasn't your mother.
Help! Matilda! Matilda!
That boy...
we buried near the caravan park.
He did die,
but that was an accident.
Too much sedative,
and it forced us to take you,
instead and...
..I think you were
a far better choice.
Sit up, Matilda.
Sit up.
You see...
..we need you.
What are you going to do to me?
Incredible things.
She would have helped
my boy, Matilda.
Take away the pain.
You're mad.
She's done amazing things.
I can make your dreams
come true, too.
I don't want anything from you.
You want to find out
who you really are,
to solve the mystery of your past.
Isn't that true?
There's...always been
something inside you.
Like an itch you can't reach.
Well, here's your chance
to scratch it.
No.
You're free to leave, if you want.
But if you go...
..it's over.
You'll never know the truth.
Then there are
the criminal charges against you.
Although Verity will recommend
you be sectioned instead and...
..even if you did escape that,
what would you be returning to?
Your friend Hal...
..gone.
Your career...
..gone.
Your real mother, in a coma.
You did that.
You. You took it all from me.
No, Matilda.
You did it.
All those things,
you sacrificed them to get to here.
The answer's in here.
The answer to all your questions.
An answer so incredible...
..you can't imagine.
She's telling the truth, Matilda.
I swear it.
Here I am...
You've burnt so many bridges
to get here.
How could you back away now?
Here I am...
I can feel you.
We can talk.
I'm your...
I'm...
Here I am.
Here I am.
Here I am...
Ah!
Aargh!
Argh...
Ah!
Ugh.
Ah!
It's time.
We need to get her out.
Those things, are they inside her?
Those things scuttling
around this house are nothing.
Errand boys.
What's in her is a great one.
An Archangel.
A shard of the divine.
It been in her all the time,
just below the surface...
..unable to rise up to take control.
All we've done is complete
what we started 23 years ago.
We've released it,
and I will stand on its right hand.
We all will.
She hasn't moved.
I expect it'll take
a while for it to recover.
To get used to being in control.
Verity...
Well, why don't you go
and check on the boy?
Go.
I think I'm going to be sick.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Why don't you make yourself useful,
and put the kettle on?
Nicholas could soon
become a problem.
He already is.
As is your wife.
I sorted Ewan out when he wouldn't
come back into the fold.
I can quite easily
do the same with Verity.
I...
Oh, Lloyd.
Cheer up.
This is a happy day, not a sad one.
Hmm?
Is he all right?
I only gave him a mild dosage,
should be fine.
Could something else
have crossed over?
Who's there?
Who's there?
Hello?
Stephen?
Stephen!
Matilda?
Is it you?
What I said before, it's true.
I swear.
I didn't want any of this.
They forced me to.
You know that, right?
Oh, my God.
Where have you...? What's happened?
Matilda.
It's too late. It's too late.
OK.
OK, let's get you inside. Come on.
Come on, it's OK.
The power's out and
she's not in the lock-up.
I'm going to Dean House.
Meet me there.
I'm sorry, boss. Inspector...
I mean, Mr Kendrick, he said...
What's the situation here?
I've been knocking but
there's no-one answering.
Oh, bloody hell!
Hello?
You check the back.
Hello?
The trap door was opened
under that basement room
but there's no-one there.
OK.
Hello?
Hello?
I think David needs to see a doctor.
Find out.
Just check.
They were wrong.
You're OK.
I think so.
And you?
I've had a shower now.
I don't smell so.
Will you come with me to see Rose?
I can't. Not yet.
You go for me.
Go on.
Hi.
I'm sorry to intrude on you.
You two probably want
some time alone, yeah?
No, stay.
I missed you.
I missed you so much.
Matilda? We do need to have a chat.
I'll be back in a minute, OK?
What's that for?
I just wanted to.
Still no sign of the Satlows...
..Sylvia Walsh, Nick Dean
or Stephen Kendrick.
Even though all their cars
are up at Dean House.
If I knew anything at all,
I would tell you.
But, like I said, I don't remember.
Do you know how convenient
that sounds?
I've been having blackouts, OK?
Check my medical records.
The last thing I know from last
night, I was in your cells.
Then you woke up at Dean House
and heard David upstairs crying.
You've spoken to David.
What does he say?
That the Satlows gave him
orange juice and he fell asleep.
Next thing he knew,
he was with you at Dean House.
Which is exactly what I told you.
For now, I'm dropping the charges
relating to what happened
at the Satlows'.
But I am going to have
to interview you again
about how you got
out of the lock-up.
I'm happy to do that, but as I said...
You don't remember anything.
I'll be in touch.
