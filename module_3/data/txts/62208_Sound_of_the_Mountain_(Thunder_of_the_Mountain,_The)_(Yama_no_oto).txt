- Goodbye
- Goodbye
Has dad gone home?
Yes.
I told him not to wait for you.
Did he say anything?
The dance hall thing again.
Are you coming with me?
No, not every night.
Why not? Come on.
Kamakura, Tokyo outskirts.
Thanks a lot.
Please come again.
Hello, Mr. Ogata.
Father!
You're early.
What are you looking at?
A sunflower.
As big as a man's head.
Head...
Age is ravaging mine.
Even a sunflower reminds me.
I wish my brain were
as alert as that flower.
I'd like to send my brain
to a laundry.
Free my head from the body
and send it to a hospital
for a "brainwash".
Please, father.
That would be splendid.
While the brain is being washed
the body wouldn't have to
think about anything.
That would be strange.
The body could sleep.
And wouldn't even snore.
I'm afraid you still haven't
recovered from your illness.
But that was a year ago.
Why don't you have
some x-rays taken?
As you wish, madam.
Here.
What are they?
Ear shells.
Kikuko, a glass of
water with sugar.
Whatever you say, sir.
Is that for dinner too?
Yes.
Excellent meal!
Crab, shrimp and
ear shells.
Just like in a restaurant.
We didn't need
the ear shells.
Delicious dishes.
I bought three ears.
I only see two.
The grandparents will share one.
They have weak teeth.
I'm not so old.
Are you calling me grandpa?
I don't see any grandchildren.
I'm sorry, father.
Kikuko is right.
One is more than enough.
You only bought three?
There's four of us with Shuichi.
But Shuichi is never home.
Why don't you
come together?
Here, father.
Kikuko,
that maid we had,
what was her name?
Kayo?
Yes, Kayo.
Just before she left
she had a pain in her foot
when she'd go out for a walk.
She said it was an "o-zuré".
She thought the "o" went
before "zuré",
that is, "respect".
But she meant
a strap wound.
The "o" was from the
Japanese word for "strap".
What an accent!
Kikuko, say the
respect "o-zuré"
O-zure.
That's it. Say the strap one.
O-zuré.
Dinner is getting cold.
You're home!
Are you hungry?
No.
Do you want to take a bath?
Don't worry.
At least wash your face.
Kikuko!
Come here!
Tanizaki, your secretary,
will find us a maid.
Is that necessary?
Why not?
We need a maid.
But maybe she'll talk to Tanizaki
who'll tell Kikuko.
Nonsense!
Well, all right.
Did she say anything about me?
No.
Seem like you made sure
that she wouldn't.
I don't agree.
A scandal with my
father's secretary.
I'm not that naive.
No. But there is someone that
Kikuko knows nothing about.
Did Tanizaki tell you?
Tanizaki goes out with you knowing
that you have another woman?
That says a lot about her.
Can't believe it!
I'm leaving her.
Really.
What does she have
that Kikuko doesn't?
One is a torrent,
the other a lake.
Haven't you ever
had an adventure?
Don't be impertinent.
There you have it.
I'll tell her all about
it when it's over.
Don't tell Kikuko about her.
I won't.
Maybe she already knows.
It's you, Fusako!
Such a long time...
Satoko...
Come in.
Mother! Mother!
Your daughter's here.
Fusako here?
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Good morning.
You look terrible, Fusako.
The train was packed.
Move away.
I'm glad you've come, Satoko.
Say "hello".
Did you walk from
the station?
The bus was full.
Satoko, go with your mother
and get washed up.
You'll need some towels.
I've brought some.
Hello.
Fusako's come with the kids.
Fusako?
Isn't Shuichi with you?
Why has Fusako come?
I think she wants to stay.
Look at all the clothes.
Leave that!
Why? I'm not
stealing anything.
That's even worse.
Why can't I see how much
money she's brought?
Perhaps she doesn't even have
enough money for diapers.
I don't know how she manages.
This is the cloth that
I used to wrap
the mirror I gave
her for her wedding.
That says it all.
Why didn't she use the suitcase
I gave her for
her honeymoon?
It's heavy.
She doesn't care
what others think.
I wonder what Kikuko is thinking.
I also used this cloth
when we got married.
Is it that old?
Even older.
It was my sister's when she died.
- Has dad come?
-Yes.
- Can I drink a bit?
- Yes.
Your father doesn't want me
looking at your things.
I'm sorry.
You should be.
I don't care.
My husband thinks I can't run
away from him without money.
That's why I carry nothing.
Maybe he has another woman.
But he'll have to think hard
due to the children.
Kikuko, here...
Not pregnant yet?
Satoko, don't go
near the wash.
You could soil it.
Satoko.
What's going to happen
with the children?
Will I keep them or will he?
Kikuko!
Kikuko!
What's wrong?
Quiet!
We're talking.
Crying won't get you anything.
Is she faking it?
Yes, she wants some crackers.
Runs in the family.
Did you call me?
A handkerchief.
Do you want me to
bring you something?
I promised her some crackers and forgot.
You can't deal with her.
You yourself are but a child.
Are you going out on Sunday?
Yes.
I knew you wouldn't help me.
I said I'll speak
with your husband.
That's it!
Either Shuichi or father
will go and see him.
And find out what's going on.
Father!
You're not paying any
attention to us, are you?
What can I say?
You can never know what's
going on in a marriage.
Exactly!
You can't meddle in a
married man's affairs.
I'm not asking for anybody's help.
Think twice before doing anything.
I'm not attractive enough
to hold on to him.
- Kikuko, bring me some tobacco.
- Yes. Forgive me.
I was born ugly.
Father was disappointed,
it seems.
I wish I were as pretty as Kikuko.
What a shame!
Kikuko's got her own problems.
You're very good to her.
I wish my in-laws were
as good as you two.
Kikuko's earned it.
We have a high regard for her
because she's been
very good to us.
But not to me.
I'm going out.
Thank God!
I was worried!
Your clothes are wet.
Music with this storm?
I was scared.
I was worried about you.
Music relaxes me.
Kikuko, you haven't played
that cradle song for ages.
That gift from your school friend.
It was a nice gift for newlyweds.
Now we're worn out.
Aren't you wet?
- We're here.
- They are, mother.
Really? Well...
Is everything fine here?
You mean because of the typhoon?
It blew hard.
And it's gone.
Thank goodness.
Father...
Light's out.
I know.
Get the candles.
I wonder if Fusako is all right.
She must have made
peace with her husband.
She came back a bit upset.
Perhaps they've
stopped fighting.
With two children,
you can't fool around.
If the storm has damaged the house
she'll have a lot of work with
her sick mother in law.
Yes, she has rheumatism.
And a bad one.
Her house is very drab.
Just like many others.
It wasn't that bad before
they got married.
She depresses me.
But when Kikuko speaks to me
I always cheer up.
You prefer Kikuko over anyone else.
I don't have any
special preferences.
Yes you do.
You never liked Fusako,
and fussed over Shuichi.
I know you.
Even now,
you don't say a word
about his behavior.
You're good to Kikuko,
but that's cruel.
It forces her to hide her jealousy.
I'm sorry for Fusako.
I was impatient and
sent her back.
Then tell her to come back.
She's almost 30.
A big girl.
Is she expecting us to
file for her divorce?
You wouldn't be too happy
if she came here with the children.
Neither would you.
I don't like the idea either.
We have no heart.
It's your influence.
I take that back.
Just wanted to annoy you.
How eloquent!
My sister was beautiful.
I always knew you
preferred her.
But I'm over it now.
If she hadn't died,
you would have married her.
Foolish talk!
You weren't lucky.
Let's go to sleep.
They'll think we have insomnia.
Isn't it true?
Kikuko.
Mr. Ogata!
A telegram!
Thank you.
You like these flowers, don't you?
Yes.
We have lots of them.
They're beautiful.
Looks like a telegram.
Looks like?
It's from the country.
My cousin, perhaps.
- Put this in the flower pot.
- Yes.
Fusako and the children are
at the country house.
What? Gone again?
Any news of her husband?
Maybe he's too ashamed
to talk to us.
I wonder why she
didn't come here.
As a father, you should worry,
not wonder.
If only you were more understanding
you'd know why she hasn't come.
With Shuishi this way,
maybe Kikuko will also leave.
We can't assume responsibility
for our children's lives.
You've never understood women.
Women can feel very hurt.
Do you think you understand them all
just because you're a woman?
Shuichi didn't come home last night.
Why didn't you bring him with you?
You come alone and let
Kikuko take care of you.
That's not right.
Besides, I want him to solve
Fusako's problems.
We'll send him to bring her.
Will he go? It doesn't seem
to bother him too much.
What will our town
relatives think?
With her in that empty old house.
Is something wrong with Fusako?
She went to Shinshu to
live in the bungalow.
I'll be gone for a couple of days.
Business?
More or less.
- Where are you going?
- Shinshu.
Must be cold there.
Don't catch a cold.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
She's a nuisance.
And so are you.
I was going to the
dance with her.
Go with dad.
Have fun.
I'm sorry you missed your date.
I'm used to it.
I'll go with you.
Do you know who that woman is?
Is she a dancer?
No, she isn't, sir.
Is she young?
Yes. Younger than his wife.
Pretty?
She is.
She has a coarse voice.
And he likes it.
Coarse voice, eh?
Do you often see her at the dance?
Now and then.
Did he introduce her?
Yes, very informally.
I don't understand him.
Does he take you with
him to get her jealous?
She ignores me.
Why?
She's got company too.
Another man?
No, a girl friend.
I was starting to think
that he likes swapping.
They live together.
- The two girls?
- Yes.
Have you been to their home?
Yes.
Where does she live?
What are you going to do?
Don't worry.
Will you go see her?
Then, it's better if you see
her friend first.
The tutor, eh?
Do you want me to take
her to the office?
He gets drunk at her house.
And gets rowdy.
He even makes her sing.
I had never noticed...
When Kinuko sings,
she cries.
That's her name.
She obeys him.
After this,
I won't be able to look at
your son in the face.
I should quit.
It's around the corner.
Please, go alone.
Do they know you?
I won't go today, then.
Why not?
You just want peace
at home, right?
I know my daughter.
I'm sure she doesn't have
diapers for the baby.
I'll get a few, just in case.
Good morning!
What's going on so early?
Remember our friend Mizuta
that died a few months ago?
The funeral gift was a
box of very good tea.
I haven't had tea since then.
I wouldn't mind dying like that.
Some death!
And she was very pretty!
You would too.
My blood pressure is fine.
"I'm old, but I can still
climb the Fujiyama".
What's that? "I can still
climb the Fujiyama".
Where is the hidden meaning?
Don't be silly.
Marriage is a lottery.
And you always wind up
with a losing number.
What brought you here?
His widow asked
me to sell this.
It's a theatre mask.
It's a boy.
Put it on, please.
Do I have to?
This way?
Raise your head.
Lower your head.
Mystical. It's pretty, isn't it?
Welcome home.
You must be tired.
I'm sorry to have caused
so much trouble.
Satoko, come in.
Satoko.
- Is the bath ready?
- Yes.
So you're leaving us.
It's my fault,
for making you take
me to that house.
I'm sorry.
You did what any father would.
But I feel bad.
I took you to that
woman's house.
I've been bad.
You're not bad.
You've been good to me.
I'll ask Kinuko to not
see your son again.
Don't do it!
I will.
I don't understand.
I don't care about his wife,
but it bothers me to see him
fool around with Kinuko.
Perhaps he wants more than
what that woman can give him.
More what?
He often complains that
his wife is a child.
A child?
Yes.
In more than one sense.
Is that what he said?
Yes. And he told Kinuko too.
He says you like her because
she's like a child.
But he stopped complaining.
Perhaps he noticed
that his wife is not...
Nonsense!
Surprised?
Times have changed.
A shy girl no longer
attracts men.
Times have changed!
Going shopping?
Fusako is back.
There'll be a special dinner tonight.
- Be back early.
- Yes.
- Kikuko, Kikuko!
- Yes?
Kakis, please.
Can you read me this.
You read it.
Delicious!
They're drinking in silence.
Father doesn't seem tipsy.
I've been thinking
about father's life.
Of my life?
In general.
If you want to know
I was thinking whether
it's been successful or not.
Who can say?
If you can live without
complications,
then it's a success.
Maybe so.
But a father's life
can't be successful
if his children are
not happily married.
That's what's missing.
That's your story, right?
Enough! Fusako's here.
She might be listening.
Mom, I'm sleepy.
What's going on?
- Are you bleeding?
- Yes.
Sit down.
Rest a bit.
It's still early.
I'm sorry.
Dizzy?
Yes, a bit.
Go back to bed.
The morning air suits me.
It was nothing.
But you scared me.
You got up very early.
I was awake before
the gong sounded.
Up already?
I wander like a pilgrim
giving thanks for
my parents' grace.
Do you know that scar
on Kikuko's forehead?
Yes...
It's from birth, right?
A token of her
suffering at birth.
It gets sore when
she feels pain.
Her nose was bleeding.
She was pale, and
her scar was sore.
Did you know?
She told me.
Is there something wrong?
I've been meaning to
talk to you about her.
I wish you wouldn't
meddle in our affairs.
Have I ever done it?
Is dad there?
Yes.
Mrs. Ikeda.
I'm Ogata.
You won't mind...
Fine with me, Mr. Ogata.
I asked for you to come.
Thank you.
She also thinks your son
should leave Kinuko.
Will you be eating?
I've eaten, thank you.
- How about some coffee?
- Yes.
Coffee, please.
I live with Kinuko, so...
I'm aware of what's
happening.
Nowadays few women
leave a man because
he's married.
Kinuko, when she's drunk,
always asks Shuichi:
"Tell your wife".
"You're wife is not sending
you away to war".
"She knows you're alive
and returning home".
"Why should she care
if you have one or
two other women?"
I'm sure she doesn't mean to say...
Of course, she's drunk.
But he's not much better.
Sometimes he loses control.
And forces Kinuko to sing.
I've been told.
She hates to sing.
Sometimes I have to
sing in her place.
If not, he gets violent.
Then he leaves.
Kinuko says that all this
will be the end of her.
Why doesn't she leave him?
She can take care of herself.
- She's a dressmaker.
- Dressmaker?
A good one.
She's never been a financial burden.
I believe that.
Can't your son and
his wife live alone?
Maybe if they lived alone
he would forget Kinuko.
They won't have to move out.
I will.
Why? You can stay with us.
No, I'm leaving.
It's better this way.
It's not related to you.
Yes it is.
Of course it is.
My husband said
that I turned bad
because my father didn't love me.
I can't stay here and
be humiliated.
Relax, daughter.
There's nothing definite yet.
I can't relax.
The moon is so bright, mother.
Take this hot water
bottle to father.
Watch it.
Does it hurt?
Good morning.
I'm sorry, I overslept.
It's still early.
You've also woken up early.
Shuichi has been
groaning all night.
I was scared.
I'm sorry.
You're still in pajamas.
So what? I know I'm untidy
because my husband is too.
Why didn't you get to know him
before marrying me off?
Good morning, mother.
Good morning.
Let's go to the movies.
No?
I have a lot of things to do.
The maid can wait.
What's happening with Fusako's husband?
It's been more than two weeks.
You blame Fusako.
What have you done to help her?
You said she could stay here.
But that doesn't solve the problem.
You left her on her own.
I'm not surprised she's so grouchy.
Let's go. You can get dressed
by yourself, can't you?
Here it is.
i'm leaving.
I have to see a customer.
- What about breakfast?
- Leave it.
I'm ready.
What's wrong with your friend?
She's weak after giving birth.
How pretty.
The leaves are turning red.
You never forget your problems,
even when you're walking, do you?
I try, father.
Why didn't you
eat this morning?
I didn't have time.
I thought you wouldn't wait for me.
You should have breakfast.
I've been thinking.
Shuichi and you should...
have your own house.
Why, father?
Because of Fusako?
It's not that.
It would be the best for you.
Don't you think so?
To me...
You've been so good to me
that I would prefer to stay.
I'm not a good father.
I haven't helped you at all.
You never said anything,
but you've been good
and kind to me.
If I had to live far away from you
I'd be very unhappy.
You say that because you
miss your parents.
But Shuichi and you should
live your own lives.
How will I wait for him alone
without anybody's help?
Goodbye, father.
Did you just get here?
I took Kikuko to the hospital.
Hospital?
Is she ill?
I don't think so.
Old folks are so useless that...
Strange!
It looks like a real head.
Pretty, isn't it?
Is it a boy's face?
Up already?
Is the headache gone?
Are you feeling better?
Yes.
Maybe you're tired.
We'll have a maid soon.
I'm sorry that you're so tired.
No, I don't feel tired.
Still there with that strange thing.
They asked me to buy it.
What do you think?
There's a story here
about a couple of old folks
that commited suicide.
They were 69 and 68 years old.
It's a letter to their son-in-law.
"I think it's better to disappear
while we're still loved.
If others' affections disappear
and we become a burden
it would ruin everything
we've lived for.
We're too weak and old
to instill our beliefs
on others.
The time has come to leave this world
while we're still loved
by our family and friends.
We seek eternal rest.
May peace be with us."
I was talking to your father
about the letter we'd write
if we died together.
She said she'd write it for us.
I have nothing further to write than
what you would have written.
Kikuko,
Imagine that you die with Shuichi,
would you write your testament?
I don't know.
Why...?
I don't understand.
Why is she crying?
Must be her nerves.
Yes, that's it.
Kikuko!
Yes?
Something's wrong with this machine.
Can you take a look?
It's very old. I bought it when
I was going to school.
Move away.
It irritates me!
Sorry to bother you.
But you're handy with it.
It's just that you're tired.
You too.
We're all tired,
except the old folks.
And the ones who don't
care about anybody.
I'm going to the bank.
Any messages?
I'll go tomorrow.
Kikuko is sick.
Could be.
What's wrong?
Headache, that's all.
Are you sure?
She's in bed...
since returning from
the hospital yesteday.
She'll soon be all right.
It must be something
more than a headache.
I heard her cry last night.
Why are you asking this?
Can't she get sick?
What's the matter with her?
Shuichi!
Going out?
Tell me.
An abortion.
Induced?
Yes.
- Yesterday?
- Yes.
Did you ask her?
It was her idea.
I don't believe it.
It's true.
Why?
What made her do it?
You could have stopped her.
No. She's very nervous now.
Now?
She refuses to have
a child with me.
Because of that woman?
Exactly.
You're cruel.
You're spoiling her life.
Can't you see?
She's killing herself in protest.
She's hardheaded.
She's a woman.
She's your wife.
If you were kind and understanding,
it wouldn't have got this far.
Even with another woman.
I'm not so sure.
She knows I want a child.
She wanted a child too.
You broke her heart and
shattered her hopes.
I don't agree.
It's a nuisance.
She doesn't want my child.
I don't think she meant it.
She was hurt and you
did nothing to help her.
What will your mother say if she finds out
she's lost a grandchild?
Now that we know that
Kikuko can have them,
she'll be glad.
But, can she have another one?
Do you want my word?
How rude you can be.
How cruel!
What's cruel about having another child?
I want a son as much as you do.
But as things stand,
I don't think it's the best.
What do you mean?
It's your fault.
You've let her down
in every which way.
We've lost a son.
Who knows what we'll lose now.
Hello.
Yasuko!
Yasuko!
Let her rest.
Father.
Fusako's left us the baby.
Has she gone out?
To the post office.
Why don't you take the baby?
I will. I was just fixing my hair.
Go to bed.
- Let me have the baby.
- Yes.
I'm going to see Fusako.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Do you want some tea?
Don't bother.
Did you read about that lotus seed
that bloomed after 2000 years?
Yes.
Did you read it?
Kikuko.
If I had known,
I would have stopped you.
You didn't even stay
at the hospital.
Did you know about it much before?
No.
You said
you wanted a baby more than anybody.
Will you see the doctor again?
Yes, tomorrow.
- Good afternoon.
- Yes.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I'd like to see Kinuko.
She isn't here right now.
Can you wait a while?
Yes, thanks.
Sorry about the mess.
Sit down.
- Your son?
- Yes.
I left him at my father-in-law's.
Do you work here?
Unlike Kinuko,
I have no talent.
I teach here and also
at children's homes.
And my son...?
Hasn't come around lately.
No? Any reason?
Ask Kinuko.
Have you spoken to her about me?
She's not like me.
She has a very strong personality.
You feel more secure next to her.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ogata's father is here.
Do I have to see him?
Come with me, Ikeda.
I'm Ogata.
It was hard for me,
but I had to come and see you.
It's about Shuichi, of course.
I have nothing to say, then.
Do you want my apologies?
I think I owe you an apology.
I won't see him anymore.
You have nothing to worry about.
That's enough, don't you think?
What about the baby?
Baby?
That's my concern.
Whether I have a child or
not is my concern.
Are you pregnant?
Yes, and I'll have the child.
Why not?
A war widow with an
illegitimate child.
I don't have to ask you
to leave me alone,
but do it.
The child is mine.
And no one else's.
But, there must be some solution.
Solution?
I  don't know if I can marry again.
And much less
have another child.
But, what would Shuichi think about...?
Has he sent you?
He was enraged when he
found out about the baby.
Hi hit me and kicked me.
Maybe he feels guilty.
A happy wife would never
understand how I feel.
You wouldn't understand
Kikuko's feelings either.
Your son was furious with me.
So I told him
it wasn't his child.
It's not his son.
That settled it.
Do you mean...?
You can think what you like.
Maybe you'll be offended,
but please accept this.
It's not much.
Don't get me wrong.
An ointment for the heart?
Then we've reached an
agreement, haven't we?
Do you want a receipt?
It's you.
I had a few drinks with
the people from the bank.
Are they all asleep?
Shuichi isn't home yet.
What about Kukiko?
She's with her parents.
She's ill.
Her mother called me this afternoon.
She said that Kikuko
wasn't well
and was staying in bed.
She'll stay there some time.
Perhaps she wants to rest.
It's not that.
What is it, then?
She lost a baby.
Deliberately?
How cruel!
She didn't want to wind up like me.
With a son, Shuichi
would be different.
Kukiko is hotheaded.
Don't blame her.
She didn't want to use the
baby to hold on to him.
Why didn't she tell me?
I didn't think that Kikuko
had so much willpower.
Good night.
Go out and play!
Father is a strange man.
He doesn't even speak
openly to his daughter.
If he doesn't like how I cook,
why doesn't he tell me?
Whatever way you cook it,
spinach is spinach.
Kikuko must be a
wonderful cook.
I'm very upset.
Does it taste so bad without Kikuko?
So eloquent!
Until now, we couldn't
even cry freely.
A child can cry whenever he wants.
It's not the little girl. It's me.
Why can't I cry?
Go on.
You have a lot to tell me,
don't you?
You couldn't with Kikuko around.
I know I'm a bad cook.
But, can't you eat what
your daughter made?
Father eats with a sad face,
and doesn't even talk to me.
I'm lonely.
You must have a lot to say.
You went to the post office yesterday.
Was it a letter?
No.
Did you send him money?
Money to her husband?
He's a good man.
But keeps bad company.
Yes. Smugglers.
Father, why don't you go and see him
to find out what his plans are?
Do you want to make up?
I can take care of myself.
See?
Your father doesn't
understand women.
Please, see to it
that your daughter
can return to where she belongs.
It'll be better if you wait and see.
Tell Fusako to think
about it again.
- Women are a nuisance.
- That's right.
Thanks for everything.
- Dad will get the money.
- Thanks.
We'll celebrate.
I know a good place.
He's not here yet.
Yes, I will.
Mr. Hayashi called.
Have you seen Aihara?
Ween't you with him last night?
Yes. We spent the
night talking.
He's working hard
these days.
Fusako will be thankful.
I'll go see him myself.
Go quickly. There's something
I want to talk to you about.
It's you, Kikuko.
Are you feeling better?
I'll be there.
Have you been waiting long?
An hour.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you've come.
Are you all right?
Let's go for a walk.
I was so glad to hear your voice
again over the telephone.
That was your voice.
That's the way your voice
should always be.
How nice!
Yes. And so refreshing.
It's wonderful to have a
place like this in Tokyo.
Won't you sit down, Kikuko?
Yes? What's the matter?
You can tell me whatever you want.
You're free.
Nothing can tie you down now.
When you called me,
had you made your mind up...
... to leave him?
Tell me.
And if he begs for forgiveness?
What will you do?
I would have to think about it.
He loves you.
But he chose the wrong road
before realizing it.
That woman is pregnant.
You brought so much joy.
As a father-in-law,
there's nothing I can do for you.
You've done a lot, father.
And though I wanted to be good to you
it just made you feel obliged to me.
Forgive me!
The only thing I can do
is free you.
Be happy again!
I'll go to Shinshu
to see my old house.
I'll soon retire and will live
there with my wife until I die.
Shall we go?
It's getting cold.
When we've settled in Shinshu,
will you write to me?
Just to tell me
you're all right?
Take good care, father.
Thank you.
Dry your tears.
Or else I won't talk to you.
How nice!
This vista is so well designed
that it looks larger.
What is "vista"?
Don't you know? Perspective.
