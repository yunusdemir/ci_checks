            Mr. Lanz? I'm done.
        No.
    [ Sighs ]
    Forgive me. No.
You're just beginning.
                You liked it?
Liked it?
You made me
want to swallow poison.
And forget pitch,
rhythm and tone...
and emotional attachment
to the lyric or the melody.
            I'm sorry.
            I don't think I--
A grain of sand
slips into an oyster...
and irritates the bivalve.
What happens?
                A pearl.
Celine Dion.
    Miss Nicki Minaj.
Christina Aguilera occasionally.
All of them deeply,
profoundly irritating.
Each one of 'em a huge star.
You, mighty Mo...
    are that irritant.
        [ Inhales ]
        So you'll represent me?

            [ Squeals, Laughs ]
Welcome to the team.
        Thank you! Thank you.
                So $1,200?
It's just to cover wardrobe,
studio time, gym classes.
    Oh, I go to a gym.
Want to get you
a good blender too.
[ Richie ] Wow.
I got goose bumps.
                        Me too.
            Oh, personal check.
    - I'm going to say
      it's okay, Ronnie.
    - Yeah.
        Here's our contract.
        The only one
        we'll ever have. Ever.
My handshake is my word.
    [ Ronnie ]
    Conning checks from losers.
Booking cover bands
for bar mitzvahs.
What happened to
that smile you had, huh?
    That Richie Lanz smile.
    What'd you call it?
Hey, remember, we got
that thing at Pogo's tonight.
    Your "winner's smile."
    That's what you called it.
            All those pictures
            in your office,
            you had that grin.
    That grin, man.
    You were really something.
        Am.
Not were, sweetheart. Am.
        Yeah, sure,
        I'm taking some hits,
        you know, but this is
        all rope-a-dope, baby.
        It looks pretty bad
        for Richie Lanz
        from the cheap seats,
            but I am still

            You know,
            this is not forever.
    This is right now.
    This is Van Nuys.
Life's about seeing an open door
and walking right through it.
Obviously,
some asshole has changed
the goddamn locks on me,
but... there's still
a door there.
    I can see it.
I have always found a way.
I always will.
    - I mean, how do you think
      I found Madonna?
    - Richie.
Singing for spare change
in front of Hamburger Hamlet.
    Okay, is this our talk?
    Because you promised me...
    after one year
    I'd be singing my own songs.
            I don't really...
            see that now.

I'm going to head directly

where I will purchase for you--
        They don't have Kasbahs
        in Afghanistan.
What? No rock the Kasbah?

        They're in North Africa,

    I run over to her,
    grab her by the shoulders.
    I look her in the eye.
    I say:
        [ Retching Continues ]
                "Miss Stevie.
                I'm nobody,

    And there's a lot of kids
    out there tonight
    just like me--
    fans, who saved all month
    to come and hear
    Stevie Nicks sing.
    To see Stevie Nicks twirl."
    What happened?
        Yeah. Crazy.
        She head-butted me.
            Deviated septum--
            that I still have.
        [ Sniffs ]
            Blood everywhere,
            all over both of us.
        But Miss Stevie Nicks
        went on and did the show
        of her life that night.
    And Ms. Ronnie Smiler,
    I think you are that same
    kind of professional.
        I believe in you.

Heads up. Heads up.
What do you got?
    Horses. Horses, Mr. Richie.
        Oh, fuck.
    Come on out. Come on.
We should have taken horses.

you asked for.
Everything's here.

        Bows. The whole thing.
        [ Speaking Pashto ]
                    Heads up.
        - Yes. He's cool.
        - We done, champ?
No, I think--
Uh, everything but the, uh--
the money. It's good.
    Uh, okay, I guess
    you've got what you need.
        There's just the matter
        of an account balance.
    Is he-- Is he stiffing me?
He is not on our side.
        Yeah, I think I know
        a good cop, bad cop
        when I see it.
    He wants to pay you
    over tea at his home.
                Tea?
    Yes. And then dinner.
And then he would like us
to spend the night.
It is an incredible honor,
Mr. Richie.
            I don't know.
If you refuse,
he will be honor-bound...
to hunt you down and kill you,
and then hunt down
your family and kill them.

I heard a girl
singing just now.
Right over there.
A Pashtun girl.
            No. Impossible.
The girl in the red burka.
We saw her today.
    No, Pashtun women cannot.
    They are forbidden to sing.
The chick in the red burka
didn't get the memo.
        This girl--
Oh! Oh, God. Oh!
    This girl--
Riza, Richie Lanz
is about one thing,
one thing only.
    What is it?
                    Your ears.
        My ears.
    And signing.
So it's two things.
My ears and signing.
I hear 'em, and I sign 'em.
    So simple.
            A Pashtun woman?
            From this village?
            They will kill her,
            and then right away,
            they will kill us.
        With big, sharp rocks.
        That is simple.
Well, I think you're wrong.
I hope you're wrong.
And I think you're wrong.
Look around. Look at that.
    Look at that.
Look at that.
Look at all of that.
    And look at me.
What the hell am I doing here?
This is so crazy, so random.
    This has got to be fate.
    There's got to be
    a reason for this.
And the reason is that girl...
    and that TV show.
I am supposed to be here.
    I will talk.
You will translate.
                    We will die.
That's the spirit.
        I see that none of you
        are cable or satellite
        subscribers.
        But I'm pretty sure...
you've heard about
<i>Afghan Star,</i> huh?
    - [ Riza Translating ]
    - It's a big, big hit.
TV show that comes out of Kabul.
    [ Rooster Crows ]
[ Goat Bleats ]
    Heard about it.
    Heard about it.
Well, I happen to have
these babies right here.
                [ Translating ]
            They're like yours,
            but they're magic.
[ Riza Translating ]
    And I already know
    who the winner is.
    [ Riza Translating ]
I know who's the best,
'cause I heard the winner
here last night.
In a cave above your village.
    [ Riza Translating ]
My all-time guy
would simply tell us,
"Come together, right now,
 over her."
        [ Shouting In Pashto ]
Uh, she is Tariq's daughter.
She is Tariq's daughter.
Of course.
        [ Shouting Continues ]
        Get out!
    He-- Is he proud?
    He's got to be.
"How dare you
 my daughter insult?
                Shame. Dishonor.
Eternal death."
I mean, he just goes on, sir.

    I'm sure you know
    how to fix it.

Salima.
            I must go to Kabul.
    Allah gave me this voice.
    This is his gift.
    Absolutely.
But why are you in my trunk?
                I must honor him
                with my music.
        I must celebrate my God
        with my singing.
    I must go to Kabul. I must.
Hey, you're preaching
to the choir,
but, you know,
your father, family,
apparently will kill me.
    Then it is Allah's will,
    and we shall die together.
No. No, we shall not.
I have no intention of dying,
ever.
    Tell her, Riza.
            [ Translating ]
        [ Richie ]
        Kabul?
        That way.
    [ Clears Throat ]
    Hold it right there, Salima.
From the moment
you heard me sing,
since you found me
in the cave,
since we were put here
on this earth,
everything in our lives
has led us to this time,
this place.
Richie Lanz,
our story is already written,
and now-- now
we shall play our parts.
    We must.
    There is no choice.
    It is God's will.
                Okay, but I'm
                gonna want 20%.
                    No contract.
    Just a handshake.
    That's all I've ever had.
        A handshake is my word.
Allah loves those
who act justly.
    [ Richie ]
    All right.

Sure. We have time.
    I think you are a smart man,
    Mr. Richie, and a good one.
    All right.
    Calm down.
            Salima is in danger.
[ Richie ]
I will protect her.
[ Riza ]
Against millions?
Where will she even sleep?
I have one bed, one room.
If I bring an unmarried Pashtun
girl in my building,

tear us apart for the sin.

[ Riza Speaking Dari ]
There is no list.
There's always a list.
            I appreciate
            your passion, but--
        Not my passion.
        Salima's passion.
    I mean, I'm just
    a hustler from LA.
You know what's gonna happen
to a Pashtun girl...
that sings on national TV
in this country?
What her family is gonna do,
her father?
It's already done.
Just the fact
that her coming here,
it's done.
                Look-- And yet,
                she knows this,
    and here she stands
    in front of you
    just asking for a chance.
        Just asking for you
        to give her a chance.
        If the ulema
        doesn't shut us down,
if the ministry of information
doesn't throw me in jail,
    there will be
    another season, Mr. Lanz.
                Call me later.
    There is no later
    for Salima, or for you...
        or your country.
        If you let this girl
        sing on national TV,
    if you let the Afghan people
    see her courage--
        Stop. Stop!
        And to hear her voice--
No! You do not
lecture me about courage,
about my country.
    Never. Never.
Not you. Not an American.
You people. You talk and talk.
Have been talking at us
for far too long.
        Courage?
There are more death threats
on this show than singers.
                    Touché.
        Michael Jackson.
Pink Floyd. The Eagles.
     The Bee Gees.
    <i> Saturday Night Fever</i> album.
                Fleetwood Mac.
        Miss Whitney Houston.
            They're all giants.
            Demigods.
    They all crushed-- crushed
    40 million units or more.
            Forty million units.
        Now, you work too hard
        for me not to say this.
                I consider you
                my new friend
                in Afghanistan.
    I want you to consider me...
            your new partner.
        Now, I have an 80-20...
        that's been stepped on
        by a preexisting 70-30.
    But your 15 against my 85...
        puts us both in a palace
        in the hills, my friend.
            And those numbers
            can be massaged.
        But the first thing--
            You got to just
            hear the girl sing.
[ Speaking Dari ]
            Richie, the judges
            want to know...
        if Salima will be
        only singing in English.
That's never happened before.
    Well, I'm afraid so.
    It's a touching story.
She learned from a seriously
wounded American GI...
who was trapped in her village.
As she nursed him
back to health,
he taught her one word a day,
until finally,
the music of the West.
None of that's true. I mean,
apparently there was a soldier.
            So only Cat Stevens?
And Jimmy Cliff.
She does the Muslim West.
That's it.

        How the hell good am I

Honey, I saw the audience.
They did not dig
an uncovered Pashtun girl...
singing Cat Stevens in English.
            Sweetness and light.
        I watched that crowd.
    They wanted to go with her.
They were dying to go with her.
    They just weren't able
    to go with her
    because it was in public.
You really believe that?

for you to walk away.

and Mr. Richie's

Nah. I don't know shit.
I know, 'cause my daddy
told me that.
"Merci, just shut up.
 Put on a tube top.
Go find yourself a rich man
while you still can."
And for a long time, too long,
I believed him.
But you know what,

    I am not dumb.
I'm gonna walk out of here
with a serious nest egg...
and open my own
real estate agency in Oahu.

and I do not have time

            I am not a loser.
                I am a quitter.
If you really know talent,
and you really know
that Salima's gonna win
her way into the next round,
    then do something.
Figure something out, man.
I don't know.
    But win, goddamn it.
        God, you are
        really crazy about me,
        aren't you?
I am your partner
with this girl,
but I bet on you, Richie.
    Not her. You.
    And you better
    deliver me my 30%.
                I got an idea.
Of course you do, hon.
    It's a million-to-one shot.
    But so...
    were the Bay City Rollers.
    Hey.<i> As-salaam alaikum.</i>
                <i> Alaikum salaam.</i>
    What do you say we keep
    Salima on the ballot?
                        What?
    Well, who actually knows
    that she quit?
    I mean, officially.
                I know.
                My staff knows.
Okay, but they don't know,
right?
    On TV last night...
there was her name on the ballot
with a phone number to call.
                Yes.
You know, if you haven't
officially removed her
from the ballot, don't.
She's risked her life.
Come on.
It'd be great for
her village, for her family,
for her people,
the nation, the world,
women everywhere.
        Maybe.
        You know, probably.
But I found this girl in a cave.
And I heard her, and--
I just got to know, man.
    I just got to know.
And don't you wanna know?
                I already know.
        This conversation
        never happened, okay?
            Salima!
                Salima!
            Salima!

Technically, the daddy
did threaten to cut off my head.
That was before his lambkin
made it to the final round.
Hey, he will put your head
on a spike.
        Come on. Babe, please.
        Face-to-face? I own him.
        Everything all right?
    I have to go to work.
                        Work?
But you said that you retired.
        You-You said
        you discovered Madonna.
        I don't have a choice.
        None.
    So you're just gonna have to
    trust me on this, Richie.
                        Or not.

Don't do the Marilyn

Just save that for us.
I feel like that was

We are returning to the
picturesque Pashtun village.
    Although without backup.
    But this time
    for twice my initial fee.
You need a hook,
Mr. Bombay.
There's a million

out there.
I'm sorry.
This is what I do.
            Yeah. What you do

Me and this Pashtun girl,
we're in the hot tub
with two guys.
        Oh, Lord.
    With Azam Ghol
    and this-- this Nizar.
All right. Just give me
the gory details.
<i>Richie, shut up.</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>
Those bullets that
you sold to Salima's father--
I don't know
if they're, like, bad.
They won't fire.
They're old.
<i>Richie, it was all a setup.</i>
<i>Do you hear me?</i>
<i>You delivered</i>
<i>the bad bullets for them.</i>
<i>They used you, Richie.</i>
<i>You were the fucking patsy.</i>
And Nizar's gonna kill Salima.
He's a crazy man.
He kept screaming about it.
She's, like, a whore,
an infidel, whatever.
<i>And you put her on TV,</i>
<i>Richie.</i>
They're gonna fucking kill her.
They're gonna kill her father,
take over the village,
and you've got to do something.
            Do you get it?
Thanks for the tip, honey.
See you soon. Gotta go.
                Richie? Richie?
Slight change of plans.
Let's go back to Kabul.
                    What?
    We're not gonna go get her?
        What?
Your handshake is your word.
You shook her hand.
        You tell Salima
        that your word is bond.
    Richie,
you are her manager.
            Shit.
            Stop.
                    What?
    Just stop the car.
        Stop. Stop!
[ Engine Stops ]
            Hey! The fuck?
            What's happening?
What the hell?
I never discovered Madonna.
                [ Riza ]
                What?
I never handled
a real headliner.
I did have Eddie Money,
but it was back when
he was Eddie Mahoney.
It was long before
"Two Tickets To Paradise."
I made a few bucks.
I nailed a couple
of hot publicists.
But I also gave up
a daughter I love.
But, gentlemen,
Riza is right.
There are four
sacred bonds in this life:
a parent and child,
a husband and wife,
a priest and confessor...
and manager-talent.
    What about doctor-patient?
            [ Riza ]
            Or lawyer-client.
    Not sacred.
    [ Sighs ]
    Now, Salima...
    is my act.
    She's mine.
I am her manager.
And my act needs me.
        Now.
    [ Speaking Pashto ]
[ Riza ]
"You stole my daughter."
        Yes. But you raised her.
            [ Riza Translating ]
    And you raised her...
    - to honor and celebrate...
    - [ Riza Translating ]
        your family,
        your country
        and your God.
            [ Riza Translating ]
    And if you didn't
    truly believe that,
    wouldn't she be dead by now?
            [ Riza Translating ]
    [ Spits ]
        Hang on. It gets worse.
        [ Shouts In Pashto ]
                Understandable.
        We are your only chance.
                    "We?"
Yeah.
            There is no "we."
            I'm done with you.
        That's enough.
When were you going to tell me?
Was it a big surprise
or something?
Something you were gonna
spring on me?
            It just hit me.
    This is your killer hook.
    This is your final chapter
    of your best-selling book,
    right here.
    Oh, my book. My book.
    You mean my posthumous book.
The one that you're gonna make
all the money off of...
    after these guys shoot me
    about a thousand times?
There is no deal, Hollywood.
        [ Richie ]
        All right. All right.
                I never do this.
            If you ever tell
            anyone I did this,
            I'll deny it.
    But I'm gonna cut my fee.
        There'll be no Richie 35
        on this one.
        There'll be Richie 15,
        and we're still both
        gonna do great.
        Because this is golden.
            Brian, you don't
            wanna be the guy...
            that left the Alamo.
You are a piece of work.

        Hi.
In all the excitement,
I forgot to congratulate you.
            [ Salima Chuckles ]
        You won.
    I told you.
                    Yeah.
And that was nothing.
I had a killer arrangement
for the finals.
Strings. Gospel choir.
Wall of sound. Huge.
You would have won in a walk.
Salima, honey,
you were the best I ever heard.
                You saw it all.
    Well--
    [ Chuckles ]
    Except for this part.
    Richie, this, right now--
    This will be the best part.
            The dying part?
            [ Chuckles ]
            Not the dying part.
            The living.
You-- You folks
from the mystic East...
have a much better handle
on the whole karma,
life/death thing.

"There's a candle in your heart,

    There's a void in your soul,

        You feel it, don't you?"
                    Richie.
                    You will.
                        I--

            you will feel it.
