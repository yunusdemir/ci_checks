Brooklyn: Home of
Prospect Park, the Brooklyn Bridge,
and teen boxing sensation,
Izzy Daniels.
Look at that kid move.
<b>Jump In!</b>
Everyone thought he was
the next great champ.
And so did I.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Izzy.
- Hi, Izzy.
- Izzy, my man.
Here you go.
Keisha, loop it. Loop it.
- It is looped.
- Gotta hit the street.
- It is.
- Smoke it.
- Izzy.
- Mary.
- Get out.
- Make me.
Why do you always
have to mess with us?
- 'Cause it's fun.
- Well, leave. We gotta practice.
For what, double Dutch? Please.
The regional
competition is Friday
and our routine has to be tight
if we want to go to city.
And we have to go to city, so goodbye.
See ya.
Ooh, he gets on my nerves, y'all.
- Mmm-hmm.
- What?
What do you mean, "what"?
You like him.
- Yeah, admit it.
- I don't have time for that, y'all.
Just turn the ropes.
Ah, smell it, baby?
That's Dad's famous hot chili.
Why does it always smell so funny?
That's the Daniels' secret sauce.
What's that smell?
- Dad's famous chili
- Extra peppers.
- Just the way you like it. Right, Izzy?
- Yeah, Dad.
And, for dessert...
I tried to make it
just like your mama.
I see you stuck it out for a longer
workout tonight. That's my boy.
- Boxing is 20 percent talent...
- Eighty percent heart.
And 100 percent sweat.
- Showers aren't illegal, Iz.
- What?
- Yuck.
- Chow's up.
Izzy's dad had been a good
neighborhood boxer back in the day.
Actually, he was great.
Now he had big hopes for Izzy.
How was school today, baby girl?
I had a fight with my boyfriend.
- Boyfriend?
- Um, hello, Daddy. I'm, like, eight.
Heaven help me.
Come on, Lil Earl,
keep moving.
- Ow. Watch out. Ah.
- Yeah, that's it.
Anticipate the moves.
Hey, Izzy.
I'm OK. I'm OK.
What? I'm nasty. What.
Chuck, help him up.
You know what, you two take a breather.
So, Izzy... You want the good news
or the good news?
- I'm going to the Golden Gloves?
- Almost.
I got you one more exhibition match.
And if you win that, you'll be ready.
You know it. Who am I up against?
The only other undefeated
kid in the gym.
- Rodney.
- Big Rodney?
Wow... Third generation of Daniels'
to win the Golden Gloves.
You just keep working
on your stamina, Izzy.
Winning your bouts,
keeping your head in it.
You can almost
guarantee yourself a future in boxing.
- Slow down, Dad.
- I'm sorry.
- So what do you think, Iz?
- I think I'm going to Golden Gloves.
Alright, then. Let's get you in
the ring. You're officially in training.
Uh, big Rodney?
Here's Lefty.
Oh, you weren't ready for that one.
Watch out, here's Righty.
Here goes the family reunion.
- I know that hurt.
- Come on. Watch out.
Look at the footwork.
I taught him that. I taught him that.
- Uh, uh, uh, uh.
- Stop playing around, Izzy.
Stay focused.
Let me see the combinations.
Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. OK. Stay with him.
Get him, Izzy.
He don't know who he messin' with.
There we go. Watch that left.
That's my boy!
Ooh.
- Man, Felix, you hit me.
- You left yourself open.
Mmm-hmm. Never leave yourself open.
You're too busy trying to showboat.
- Ain't nothing wrong with being proud.
- Yeah, you're right.
Next time you feel proud,
keep your hands up.
You got it.
Hey, Mr. Daniels, I'm ready.
- Be ready for you in a minute, Tammy.
- You ready for what?
There ain't no ballet classes
around here.
Good, 'cause I can already dance
around the ring better than you.
Ooh.
Why don't you warm up
on the bag over there?
- What's up, Tammy?
- Hey, Chuck.
Hi.
What? I'm just being polite, man.
I'm gonna be sick.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Work it, now. Work it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
mmm-hmm, yeah, yeah, mm, yeah.
You know, if you're
trying to impress me...
You're gonna be up all night.
Alright, that's it.
How's that, baby?
Uh, nice, Daddy.
That kid, Rodney,
better look out for you.
- Yeah, Dad. Eighty percent heart.
- And hearing.
I'd better get that.
What?
Hey, I'll be ready to go
in a minute, baby.
- Slammin' hair.
- It's not funny. Help me.
Can you do it the way Mommy used to?
- You miss her, huh?
- Yeah.
I know. So do I.
Ah, there's a leak down at the gym,
I'd better get down there.
But what about
the double Dutch competition?
- Oh. Izzy will take you.
- What?
- Mary will be there.
- But...
Come on, Karin, let's go.
- Izzy, you coming to the movies?
- Free popcorn until five.
I can't. I gotta take Karin
to some double Dutch.
Aw, that's messed up, man.
Man, don't you have to wear a tutu
or ballerina outfit or something?
- What's that on your head?
- Quit playin'.
- Dad didn't say to take all of you.
- Well, that's what he meant.
And I hope you have money
'cause everybody's hungry.
Come and get it.
Yo, Rodney.
Rodney, the neighborhood bully.
He boxed too. But he was more
of a threat out of the ring.
He ruled the neighborhood with fear.
I know you're not talking to me, loser.
So I hear you're my competition
in the exhibition match.
- It looks that way.
- You'll never outbox me, daddy's boy.
- Yes he will. He's got mad skills.
- That's right. He's been training,
- so you better watch out.
- Training? Oh, I'm scared.
Yeah, he's the one that
should be scared. Right, Rodney?
- Yeah.
- He should be scared.
- Right, Rodney?
- What, punk?
Nothin'.
Come on. See you in the ring, loser.
Yeah, loser.
That's right, you better run.
- What?
- Yo, Iz, you sure about the movies?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, man.
- It's alright, man.
- Take care of yourself.
- Alright.
Look, there's Mary.
Mary, Mary.
You guys are the bomb.
- Let's hope the judges think so.
- Why you always so negative?
- I'm just saying the real.
- Whatever.
No, she's right. If the judges
don't like us, we're so done.
I can't breathe.
Maybe your boyfriend
can make you feel better.
Izzy Daniels?
At a double Dutch competition?
What happened? Did you lose a bet?
My dad made us bring him.
Hey, Mary. We heard you couldn't find
a fourth this year so you guys retired.
- I guess you heard wrong, Gina.
- Oh.
Yeah. Yolanda moved here
from Atlanta and she's good.
- So you Dutch Dragons better watch out.
- Mmm-hmm.
Oh... We are so scared.
Not really.
Who was that?
- Gina and the Dutch Dragons.
- Regional champs for four years.
- They are good.
- So are you guys.
I can't believe they make a big deal
out of jumping rope.
It happens to be a huge deal.
- If we qualify.
- Negative.
Which we won't do
if we stand here talking.
I don't even want to be here.
Then go. Snack bar's that way.
- Good luck, you guys.
- Thanks.
- Go.
- You...
Ladies and gentlemen...
Joy Jumpers, Dutch Dragons
and Soul Steppers...
Ready your ropes, get set, go!
In compulsory, the teams
are required to do a series of steps.
One foot hops, crisscross,
and high knee-ups.
Keep it up, Mary.
I love the speed part.
Do it.
Come on, faster.
Come on, Mary. Keep going.
Faster. Come on, Mary. You can do this.
- Faster.
- Faster!
Keep going, Mary. Come on.
- Come on, Mary. Faster.
- Yes!
I got him.
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's time for the freestyle competition!
- I love freestyle.
- You love everything.
Shh.
Yeah! Whoo!
Oh, yeah, cool.
- What?
- Nothing.
Here they are, the Joy Jumpers.
Cool.
Give it up for the Dutch Dragons.
At that moment,
Izzy couldn't explain it.
But it was as if someone had
opened a door to a whole new room.
- Come on, yeah.
- See you guys at regionals.
- See ya.
- Bye.
- You guys were so awesome.
- Thank you so much.
- Can I get a hot dog?
- No.
- What did you think, Izzy?
- Not bad, I mean, fourth place...
Cool ribbons.
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Karin.
Hey, good effort.
Oh, and, um... Cute outfits.
Now, that's a real trophy.
We'll never see one like that.
- What are you trying to say?
- Certain people need to step it up.
- We still qualified for city finals.
- But we won't get past the finals
- with that wack routine.
- I spent hours on that.
You need to watch your feet in the ropes
instead of worrying about me.
- Mmm-hmm.
- Whatever. The routine is wack.
- Right, Izzy?
- Me...? Whoa. No, no, no...
This is not my business. Look,
my dad's making dinner and we gotta go.
- No we don't.
- Yeah, we do. Let's go.
- Let's find Bridgette.
- Look, our routine isn't wack...
Rodney, don't be embarrassed.
Your dad's having a hard time
and people want to help.
Rodney was the toughest guy
in the ring and the schoolyard.
- Thanks.
- Let me know if the clothes don't fit.
- OK, Miss Roberts.
- OK.
But at home, he was just
a poor kid with problems.
What are you looking at?
You're up, Ace.
Showtime.
What's up?
- You OK?
- Yeah, I think so.
I know so. Yeah,
now show me that game face.
Yeah, that's it.
Who's the greatest?
I am!
In this corner, weighing 158 pounds,
Rodney Tyler!
- You OK?
- Yeah.
Keep your elbows low, jabs high.
Twenty percent talent,
80 percent heart.
And in this corner, weighing 148 pounds,
Izzy, "The Incredible," Daniels!
Touch gloves.
That'll be the last time
your gloves touch me, chump.
Izzy. I'm right here.
Come on, show him something.
Come on, Izzy.
Control the center of the ring.
- Ooh.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
Rodney was 158 pounds
of pure mean, and full of anger.
That anger came through
with every punch and shook Izzy.
- Your left. Your other left.
- Throw the jab. Jab.
Incredible? Incredibly lame.
Come on, Izzy.
Take deep breaths.
Deep breaths. Izzy, listen to me.
You gotta watch his moves.
He swings wild.
Alright, wait him out. Just wait
him out. He's got power, but no skills.
Just stay with him and find your rhythm.
Hey, you got this. OK.
You just stay with him
and find your rhythm.
Come on, show him something.
Yeah!
- Winner... Daniels!
- Yes!
- Whoo!
- Yes!
- Whoo!
- Yeah!
That's my boy. That's my boy!
That was great!
Good fight. Good fight, son.
That's right!
- Yeah!
- Izzy, Izzy, Izzy...
Hey, did you see
Rodney's face, man?
Aw, who turned out the lights?
I can't see. What happened?
Man, he thinks he's all big and bad,
messing with people.
- You showed him, Izzy, man.
- He just couldn't keep up.
Hey, can't be all that loud on the mat.
Yep. I'd have shown him
a quick one-two myself.
That karate chop. Kickin'.
Seeing things you never seen before.
I'd be like Lil Earl, Mr. High.
It'd be like your worst nightmare.
Where are you hiding
those "mad skills" during practice?
Felix, did I tell you?
You did a very nice job.
The way you counted him out,
that was wonderful.
It's not about knockin'
someone out, Earl.
It's about scoring points with your
combinations, and your footwork.
It's about endurance.
- And what's up here.
- And that leaves you out.
Good job tonight, Izzy.
You guys get on home.
That leaves you out.
I'm gonna give you somethin'.
Rodney wondered who left the clothes.
But after losing that night,
he never suspected Izzy.
- Yes.
- I'm sorry, Mary. I quit.
But we need you.
I didn't get in this
to play games, Mary.
I'm in it to win.
Hey, don't jump.
It can't be that bad.
Corny much.
- You cryin'?
- No.
Then why is your face all wet?
Why do you have so many questions?
I'm just asking. Trying to help you out.
Well, it's nothing you can help me with.
So, um... I heard you beat Rodney.
What, are you keeping tabs on me?
You wish.
Yeah, I did. Now I'm going
to the Golden Gloves.
Must be nice.
Yeah. It's cool.
My dad's happy.
- Mary, come wash the dishes.
- Coming!
What, you ain't gonna say good night?
- Good night, Izzy.
- Good night.
Oh, Mary... Um, since I'm in training,
I kind of need my sleep,
so if you could do me a favor
and try not to snore tonight...
Go away.
My boy Izzy was knocking Rodney out
left and right, left and right...
No, for real, he's gonna think twice
before he messes with somebody now.
Or maybe not.
Sometimes things don't always
work out the way you want.
What are y'all lookin' at?
Oh, I'm sorry. We just
didn't recognize you standing up.
- Rodney, what's wrong?
- Yeah, well, everyone saw. I tripped.
- Whatever, it still counts. Right?
- Yeah, man.
- Come on. Look, I won. It's over.
- No. I want my rematch.
Whatever, man.
Yeah, whatever. 'Cause everyone
needs to know you just got lucky.
Just... let it go.
What are you? Chicken?
I'm just saying, Tasha isn't that bad.
Girlfriend's got, like, two left feet.
And not hers.
- Hey, what about Danzia?
- Double-handed.
- What about my cousin?
- Aubrina?
- Yeah.
- She's almost blind.
It's called extreme myopia.
- Go away, Izzy. Not in the mood.
- Hey, what'd I do?
Nothing. She's just mad.
Yolanda quit the team.
Oh, why? Did she finally figure out
that double Dutch is lame?
No, she thinks we are.
She joined the Dutch Dragons.
- She thinks they're the best.
- Well, they sort of are.
Anyway, now we're down a jumper again.
- The city finals are coming up.
- You're kidding, right?
Anybody can jump some rope.
Shoot, my little sister's free.
If it's so easy... You do it.
Come on with the come on.
- Fine. Keisha, Shauna...
- Let's do this.
- Come on, Mary. Jump in.
- Come on, Mary.
- You show him, girl.
- You got this. Yes.
- Yeah. Girl, come on.
- Faster.
There you go. Show him, girl.
Come on, yeah.
- You got this. Yes.
- There you go.
Ooh.
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Good job.
- On you, boxer boy.
- Bring it on, jump girl.
Any day...
- No, come on.
- Hey, I was just kiddin'.
I was just kiddin'. One more 'gain.
OK? Come on.
He's got this?
- Hope you don't mess up this time.
- Me either.
Whoa.
Wow.
Oh, my gosh.
Enough said.
- What are you thinking?
- Don't even go there.
Still on a high from your win?
Would be if Rodney
weren't such a jerk.
Boxing doesn't solve
those kind of problems.
Never forget that, Izzy.
- Go ask him. Go on.
- Go.
OK.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
- Looking for you.
- You found me. So?
- You jump pretty fast.
- Well, I do have some skills.
At what? Bragging?
We want you to join our team.
Your jump rope team?
- Yeah.
- OK. Y'all are seriously trippin'.
No, we're not.
Look, the city finals are
coming up in a couple of weeks.
- And the competition is super tough.
- Izzy, you're a good jumper.
And you said it yourself.
You've got skills.
OK, look. I'm sorry for y'all,
but I can't go out like that.
- Alright, jump roping isn't me.
- Why?
It just isn't.
- You jump rope all the time.
- Yeah, for boxing.
- Now for whatever it is y'all do.
- You scared your boys will laugh?
Come on, Izzy.
We really need you.
No.
Forget him. It's not worth it.
Oh, come on, Mary.
You know you can't forget me.
Already forgotten.
- Dad's cooking chili again.
- Oh, I'm on it.
Large pepperoni to go.
How do you know?
The answer's still no.
We don't want you to be on the team.
Good, because it wasn't happening.
We just want you to fill in
until we can find somebody else.
Fill in?
Yep. Stand in as a fourth so we can plan
a routine while we look for someone.
So... you wouldn't
actually be on the team.
- I don't know.
- Please, Izzy. Your skills are tight.
We really need you.
- And Mary really wants you.
- Didn't seem like it.
Oh, yeah. She's all for it.
Completely.
Over my dead body.
- Why not? He can help us.
- No.
- You know, guys. I'm out of here.
- Wait. We need you.
- Mary.
- What?
We can get my play cousin, Leslie.
- But Leslie moved to Alaska.
- So what's a plane ticket?
Mary...
- Later.
- Come on.
Alright.
Fine.
Yes?
- Stay.
- Like you mean it.
We could really use your help.
Please...
Since you're begging, I'll do it.
- Yes.
- Cool.
Meet us for practice tomorrow,
after school, in the park.
The park? In front of the whole
neighborhood? Are you crazy?
Forget that. Here's the deal.
I'll do it, but it has to be
before school and at the gym.
My dad doesn't open it before eight,
so we can meet at six.
- That'll work. Thanks, Izzy.
- You're the best.
There's room for one more.
She's happy on the inside.
Way on the inside.
Way on the inside.
Izzy, wake up! Wake up.
It's time for practice.
If this is jump rope practice,
why aren't we jumping?
First we stretch.
Then we run for stamina.
Y'all are trippin'.
You guys, it's just double Dutch.
I told y'all. He thinks this is a joke.
Just double Dutch?
This is a sport. Just like football,
or basketball, or boxing.
A bunch of girls singing and jumping
through some ropes ain't a sport.
Then let's see you do something.
And I don't mean speed jumping.
What, you mean like
one of those little tricks y'all do?
- Yeah. Try this.
- Bring it.
What little song should I sing, huh?
The ring around the roses?
We don't sing. We jump.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, Mary.
There you go.
There you go.
And out. Yeah.
- What you waiting for? Do it.
- Nothing.
- Take your time.
- It's not that hard.
In. There you go.
- One, two. One, two.
- There you go. Come on.
See? It's not that easy.
You guys just said you needed
someone to fill in. That's why I'm here.
I don't need to learn that.
You wanna practice or not?
Not.
Let's practice, y'all.
Fine. Let's just do it.
And when you jump in,
stop going all wild with your legs.
Come on, Izzy. Go.
Keep your legs together.
Go back a little bit.
OK, let's start with speed jumping.
I think we can take five seconds off...
If we try.
How about freestyle?
We don't have time
to watch you try to freestyle.
Just turn the ropes.
OK, Izzy, you can do it.
And what?
Come on, Izzy. Pick it up.
Come on, Izzy. Get out of your head.
Come on. Let's go.
Come on.
You know what, let's take five.
Izzy, wake up out there.
Girl boxer, one.
Boy double Dutcher...
...zero.
Hey Tammy.
- Nice work today.
- Mmm-hmm. What's up?
About that boy double Dutching thing...
- What?
- I'm trying to keep that on the DL.
I bet you are.
- So...
- Calm down.
I'm not gonna say anything.
Just as long as you stop
all your girl boxer jokes.
Especially around Chuck.
You like Chuck?
- Yeah, cool. I could do that.
- OK.
Ooh, you're late.
Dinner starts at seven in this house.
It always has.
Maybe things should start
changing around this house.
Your mother had dinner at seven.
Dinner is at seven.
Now sit down and eat, Isadore.
Come on, Izzy.
Let's work the freestyle.
So listen...
I think we need a new routine.
- Why?
- Why?
'Cause... yours is... you know...
- What?
- Boring.
What do you know?
I know those judges at regionals
weren't feeling you.
Great. Even with the best
compulsory and speed,
we still can't win
without the freestyle.
So just change the routine.
You keep rehearsing it and trying
to make it all perfect and precise.
- Because that's what they look for.
- But is it fun?
It's not about fun. It's about winning.
Shouldn't freestyle be about fun?
It's like the same thing
you used to do when you were little.
Just... with more tricks, right?
Well, yeah.
Remember when you used to play
in the street and sing them silly songs?
What's the one Karin and her friends do?
- Mary Mack.
- Yeah.
- # Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack.
- # All dressed in black, black, black.
- Yeah, that's it.
- Your point?
It's the difference in double Dutch
for competition...
...and just doing it for fun.
So what do we do... Mr. Smarty?
Well, I do have one idea.
Who are they?
I thought I knew every team out there.
Maybe they're just jumping to jump.
People do that.
It's not all about competition.
Whoa!
So how'd you know about all this?
I didn't. I just...
I figured the best boxers always
come from the streets, so...
Not bad... for a boxer boy.
Since I'm so in touch with my natural
size, I didn't want to hurt it...
- Hey, anybody seen Izzy?
- Nah.
No, sorry.
- Hey, where's Izzy?
- I don't know. He's usually never late.
As I was saying, since I'm so in touch
with my natural size...
- That was so amazing.
- It was.
- My name is Mary.
- Yeah.
- I'm reppin' tough.
- Yeah.
- You get in my way.
- Yeah.
I'll mess you up.
- Ooh, she thinks she's bad.
- I know I'm bad.
- Ooh, she thinks she's cool.
- Cool enough to steal your moves.
- Ooh.
- I see how it is. OK.
- You go, Izzy.
- Me? Alright, hold on.
- My name is Izzy.
- Yeah.
- I'm smooth and clean.
- Yeah.
- When I jump rope.
- Yeah.
- All the girls scream.
- Ooh, he thinks he's good.
- I rule this 'hood.
- He makes me holler!
Watch me while I pop my collar.
- OK. That was good.
- Like that? Yeah.
I can't wait
till we start our new routine.
- It's gonna be hizzot!
- Yeah.
- Hey, look at daddy's boy.
- Rodney.
Well,
wasn't that just adorable?
Maybe I should show these girls
what a loser you really are.
Loser? Last time I checked,
I won that match.
Yo, you don't want to do this.
Hey Rodney, why don't you just chill?
- Ooh!
- Run, run, run!
Show off.
I can't believe this!
Hey, goofy.
- Thanks.
- For what?
Nothing...
...everything...
I don't know.
So, uh... Those jumpers
were pretty cool, huh?
Well, well, well...
Look who likes double Dutch.
- Who?
- You always have jokes, huh?
I don't know... I guess I do.
You know, it's just...
There's something about it.
Better than boxing?
It's OK if you do. You know...
It's complicated. I mean, my dad...
- Boxing's kind of his thing.
- That's what I thought about ballet.
Every September,
my mom would sign me up.
It's like, school started, so ballet
started. I thought she loved it.
Then last year, I finally said,
"Mom, I hate ballet. "
And you know what she said?
"Good. 'Cause you look like a horse
galloping across the stage anyway. "
But...
Boxing's all my dad really has.
No. He has you.
- Corny much?
- I'm just saying...
Thanks. It's just not that easy.
Um... I'm gonna go
work on that new routine.
See you tomorrow.
- Bright and early.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Bright and early.
- Oh.
- Where have you been?
I was...
Um...
- Out with my friends.
- I see.
- So I guess you were busy.
- A little.
Too busy to remember
you had a practice match?
Or that your curfew was two hours ago?
Look, I'm sorry I missed curfew and
I'm sorry I missed the precious match.
What's been going on with you lately?
- Nothing.
- Uh-uh. Something's going on.
And I think we need to
sit down and talk about it.
- Are you nervous about the match?
- No, Dad.
- Don't lose focus now.
- I'm... I'm not, Dad.
Izzy, I just don't want you
to disappoint yourself in the ring.
I won't be late again.
- It's not over, daddy's boy.
- Yeah.
- Where you gonna run to now, fool?
- Yeah?
Look, man, don't hit me. I promise
I'll give you my lunch money.
- What?
- Mr. Tyler! Mr. Hooks.
- Miss Roberts?
- Come with me.
Detention?
It's free. So you won't be
needing Mr. Daniels' lunch money.
It's not over.
Oh, snap!
Double Dutch?!
Big mistake, daddy's boy.
- All right. Whoo!
- There you go. Keep going.
Faster, faster. You got it.
- That's it.
- Go, go, go, go.
We're awesome.
Yeah, we're gonna
smoke the city finals now.
Sorry to rain on the parade, but don't
we still need a fourth person for that?
Mary's right.
We still gotta find somebody.
I just wish... Never mind.
Maybe we could beg Yolanda to come
back. I mean, our routine is tight now.
Right. Like that's gonna happen.
Great. We're the bomb
and nobody's gonna see it.
Excuse me... Maybe I can help.
- You know someone?
- Yeah, who is it, Izzy?
- Me.
- What?
You're obviously not gonna find
anyone as good as me, so...
Oh, we are so gonna win now.
So superstar,
what changed your mind?
- Guess I hate to disappoint the ladies.
- Please.
- What about your boys?
- I figure they don't have to know.
- Hey, then welcome to the team.
- Yeah.
So now that we've got a team...
...maybe we could enter this.
- The Double Dutch Showcase?
- It's at the Elgin in Harlem.
- It's also in three days.
- I don't think we're ready.
- Hey, we're ready.
- He's right.
- We're ready.
- Cool.
But I do have one condition.
- What?
- The name. Joy Jumpers?
I can't go out like that.
- I like our name.
- We're cool with changing the name.
Good. Alright, how about
The Hot Chili Steppers?
- I love it.
- It's alright... I guess.
Cool. Ready?
Hot Chili Steppers on three.
- One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Hot Chili Steppers!
- Where are you going?
- Nunya.
- Mmm-hmm. Dad, Izzy's leaving.
- Karin.
- Where you going?
- I was just gonna, um...
You know, out with Mary.
Ooh. Izzy and Mary sittin' in a tree...
- Chill, Karin.
- Whatever.
Sure been spending
a lot of time with Mary.
- What?
- Hey, she's a pretty girl.
Dad...
- Can I go.
- Uh, you could.
Or you could hang out with your dad.
The Arena. Evans, Chavez. Today.
- Today?
- That's right.
You and me,
we're gonna see a real champ.
- Um...
- So what do you think?
Where is he?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.
- He'd better.
I know.
Hello?
Oh, hi Izzy.
No, Mary's not here.
She's already gone.
OK. Bye-bye.
Team put in some work. Alright...
You guys ready?
I guess so.
...for The Hot Chili Steppers!
That's the champ.
That's what I'm talking about.
- Hey, so did you have fun tonight?
- Yeah.
It's like your mind was somewhere else.
No. It was cool.
I had fun, Dad.
- I'm glad.
- Thanks.
- Good night, Ace.
- Good night.
Hey, Mary.
Mary! Are you there?
- What?
- I'm sorry about today.
I don't care, Izzy.
My dad got us tickets to a boxing match.
A boxing match?!
Oh, then my bad!
- I tried to call.
- What was that gonna do?
You asked to be on the team.
Then you left us hanging.
You had us all fooled,
thinking you liked double Dutch.
We looked like fools up there.
We were counting on you.
- But I guess it's a joke to you, huh?
- What was I supposed to do?
- Make a choice.
- I, I couldn't.
I'll do it for you.
You're off the team.
What?
Double Dutching is serious to us.
To me.
And you showed me I can't rely on you.
Mary.
Lucky punch.
- She's not lucky, she's good.
- What?!
- Tammy's a good boxer.
- Yeah, for a girl.
For anybody, man. I remember
she knocked you out last week.
I told you a thousand times,
I thought I saw a quarter on the mat.
Just 'cause she's a girl
doesn't mean she can't box.
Just like guys can do other stuff too.
Come on, one more!
- What's his problem?
- I think she's good too, man.
Let's go, Tammy.
- This is stupid. We need Izzy back.
- No way.
We do. We can't compete
in the city finals without a fourth.
Plus, I kind of miss him.
And so do you.
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Mary.
He's apologized like eight times.
He couldn't say no to his dad.
Yeah, it's not like
he did it on purpose.
And he's helped us.
Look, you're the one who's always
talking about how we gotta be perfect.
Well, we were close with Izzy.
Hi.
- Oh, I see him.
- Did he wear a tiara?
Oh, there he is.
What's up, ballerina boy?
How does he show his face after this?
Loser.
- Izzy, what's up with this, man?
- Nice legs, Isadore.
What are you trying to say?
You're my friend, so I'll explain.
What we're trying to say...
You look real pretty.
Your mama looks real pretty!
Calm down, man.
We're just playing.
Now I see why you won't
give me a rematch.
'Cause you're too busy
jumping double Dutch.
I went with the pink.
Nice touch, don't you think?
- Girlie man likes to jump rope.
- Loser.
Izzy.
Izzy.
Going to jump double Dutch.
Look at him. Skipping the rope.
- That's real pretty, baby.
- Thanks.
- What's that, Daddy?
- A surprise for Izzy.
I won this the night I won
the Golden Gloves.
- Izzy, can we talk?
- What's up, Dad?
I found this.
- You were snooping through my trash?
- My house. My trash.
Now, what's this about double Dutch?
Nothing.
He's mad 'cause kids laugh at him
'cause he's on a double Dutch team.
Hey, I'm eight. I know things.
- What is she talking about?
- He's part of The Hot Chili Steppers,
- Mary's team. Rodney...
- Shut up, Karin.
Shut don't go up. Prices do.
So take your advice, and shut...
Both of you, quiet.
Karin, go to your room.
Is this the reason your mind's
not been in the ring?
Talk to me, Izzy.
Why didn't you tell me about this?
- Because.
- You wanna elaborate on that?
'Cause you wouldn't have heard me
unless I was talking about boxing.
That's all you ever talk about, Dad.
OK, that's all we ever talk about
since Mom died.
You know, I don't even like it anymore.
I'm just doing it for you.
That's... That's not fair.
Just 'cause you don't have a life,
doesn't mean you take mine away.
I'm sorry, Dad.
It's OK.
Um...
Looks like we're out of milk.
I'll be right back.
Izzy. I've been looking for you.
Yeah, you found me.
Look, the girls and I were talking...
- And I just wanted to ask you...
- I'm not doing it.
- What?
- Look...
I gotta focus on boxing.
I don't understand.
I'm a boxer.
I can't be champion if I'm jumping rope
with a bunch of girls.
What are you talking about?
- Is this because of Rodney and them?
- No.
Look... It's not just Rodney, OK.
You love double Dutch, Izzy.
You know you do.
And you're good.
I'm not doing it.
I'm sorry.
No, Izzy... I'm sorry.
What's up?
Double Dutch competition's
tomorrow, right?
So that's it, you're just gonna punk out
'cause kids are laughing?
Look...
You normally get on my nerves,
but I'm not gonna let you
go out like that.
Imagine if I listened
to every stupid comment
you and your boys made about me.
You think that I'd be
the best girl boxer in the city?
People make fun. I figure...
That's their problem.
Listen to her, boy.
Tammy's got a good head
on her shoulders.
What's up, daddy's boy?
Where you running off to now?
Ballet class?
So what? You out of words?
- Here's one. Move.
- No!
- It's time for that rematch, punk.
- Yeah, so gear up.
- What?
- Or are you too chicken?
You know what...?
Let's do this.
You're about to get schooled.
Well, those who can't, teach. Right?
- What's going on?
- It's a rematch. Rodney and Izzy.
You gonna box or dance,
jump rope boy?
Why? Won't change the fact
I already beat you.
- Yeah, beat you bad.
- Real bad.
Watch it, man.
Will beating me change
the fact your dad's out of work?
Whoa.
- I'm warning you.
- Or everyone thinking you're a bully.
You tell him, Izzy.
I said, watch it!
You can't use fighting to get respect.
You running, daddy's boy?
Why don't you run
back to your jump rope?
I don't need ropes to do this.
Ohh!
But with ropes, it's more impressive.
Know what else
looks better in the ropes?
- Rodney.
- Stop it. I mean it.
It's over, man. Let's end this.
- No!
- Rodney, you got jumped.
Stop it!
- That's right!
- Yo, that was smooth.
Yeah, that's my best friend there.
I am sorry about your dad.
OK, I'm sorry I beat you.
I'm sorry you're so angry,
but I'm not doing this with you.
You can keep your "sorry".
Man, we have both
got a lot to be mad about.
But fighting isn't gonna
make it any better.
There's more important things.
Boo!
Fight, fight, fight, fight...
- Yeah, finish it, Izzy.
- Do it.
Go ahead, man.
- Show him, Izzy.
- No.
Look, man, I'm done with you.
I'm done with this.
I don't know about you,
but I am tired of being mad.
Alright?
- Yeah.
- That's my boy.
Rodney was tired of being mad too.
He just didn't have the words to say it.
The truth was, he was impressed.
Nobody had ever stood up to him.
No one had the nerve
to tell him the truth like Izzy.
It was a moment he would never forget.
We're here
at the double Dutch city finals.
The top three teams with highest scores
in compulsory, freestyle, and speed
will qualify to go
to the state championship.
The winner of state could go on
to compete at the World Championships.
This is all very exciting.
- Is he coming?
- I said no.
- But we need him.
- Why? We've got Aubrina.
Great.
Sorry.
Wait.
We are so gonna lose.
Izzy.
- Forget Izzy. He's not coming, OK.
- Yeah, girl. Let it go.
No... Izzy, he's here.
Izzy?
You guys weren't gonna try
to do it without me, were you?
- We thought you quit.
- I did.
I'm sorry.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. "
That's all you got?
Um...
'Cause around here
you need two "I'm sorry's".
And a uniform.
Alright. Yes.
Aw...
You guys actually entered?
Who'd you scrape the bottom
of the barrel and find?
Izzy Daniels?
- He's good.
- Mmm-hmm.
Right, I'm sure
he's good enough for y'all.
My grandma would be
good enough for them.
- Ha! You'll see.
- Good luck with that.
Oh, and don't worry. I'll let y'all
take pictures with our trophy.
- Please.
- Your trophy...
We will.
- I can't stand her.
- Forget her.
OK. But I still can't stand her.
So, Izzy, what changed your mind?
Let's say, sometimes
you gotta listen to your heart.
Well, I'm listening
to my heart right now,
and it's saying we are
so gonna be all that, OK.
- You know it.
- Yeah.
- On three. One.
- Two.
- Three.
- Hot Chili Steppers!
Right now, I'm looking
for The Hot Chili Steppers.
I'm looking for the Dutch Dragons.
I'm looking for the Sunshine Steppers.
Ready your ropes...
Go!
In compulsory,
left and right toes on one foot,
crisscross, and the high step
is one point a piece.
Now, who wants to win this?
Who wants it? Get up in it.
Come on, baby. Give it to me.
Out. Good job.
Alright, good job. Good job.
Time. Time!
In compulsory... Third place...
The Sunshine Steppers!
In second place...
The Dutch Dragons!
- This is it. This is your time.
- It's all you!
In first place...
The Hot Chili Steppers!
- Come on, Izzy. Do it.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
what you are witnessing is speed.
Blinding speed.
I mean, just look at their feet
and try and count the steps.
If you can.
Faster. Faster.
Time. Time. Time.
Alright, good job. Good job.
Let's see what we got.
Let's see what we got.
Let's see what we got.
- Alright.
- You were great.
Let's get the scores first.
In third place,
with 369 steps per minute,
the Jive Jays.
Second place, with 372 steps per minute,
- The Hot Chili Steppers!
- Yes!
And first place,
with 378 steps per minute,
the Dutch Dragons!
Second place... That's cute.
Now with both teams tied,
we're down to the freestyle.
This is my favorite part
of the competition,
where teams can do practically
anything to wow the judges.
Sky is the limit in freestyle.
So right about now, I want you guys
to show some of that love...
...for the Kung Fu Flyers!
Give it up for the Jive J's!
Here are the Jump Masters!
- You alright?
- Yeah.
Some of these teams are really good.
And so are we. Hello?
Alright, I want you to keep that energy
going as we welcome to the stage...
...the Dutch Dragons!
OK, we're right after the Dutch Dragons.
- Why you sweatin' other teams?
- What'd you do with Mary?
Somebody told her to stop trippin'.
And just have fun.
You know what, this is weird.
I've never been on a team before.
It's always been just me and my fists.
- I've never had to count on anybody.
- You can count on us.
- Yeah.
- Right.
- Let's do this.
- Alright.
Let's do this y'all!
That's what I'm talkin' about.
Izzy, you can do this.
Alright, right about now...
- Fine. Let's do it.
- Show some love...
...for The Hot Chili Steppers!
- Yeah! Alright!
- Whoo!
Yeah! Come on, now!
Do it! Here we go!
I can't hear you!
Oh, ho, ho! That's like...
Come on! Come on!
- That's a nice job!
- Way to go, Izzy!
- Come on!
- Yeah!
Yeah! Whoo!
- Mom!
- Congratulations, baby!
Oh, you were wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.
- Hey, there's Izzy.
- You were great.
Thanks.
Mary!
Hey, Dad.
You look good out there.
Thanks.
- I'm sorry.
- No, Izzy.
I am.
I want us to be able
to talk about anything.
You know, after your mom died,
I guess I pushed boxing
a little more because
I thought that
you loved it so much.
And I loved it so much...
Just a way for us to connect...
To be there for each other.
I love you.
And I... I know you miss your mom.
'Cause I do too.
I guess boxing
was just a way for me to say all that.
Boxing is my dream.
It doesn't have to be yours.
You know, I always say boxing is
20 percent talent and 80 percent heart.
Well... It looks like your heart
is somewhere else.
That's OK.
I am so proud of you.
And I know your mom would be too.
- I just wanna be your champ.
- You are.
Thanks, Dad.
There he is.
Some friends are waiting for you.
- Oh, man!
- That was off the hook, Izzy.
Off the chain!
You know, it's alright
if you think it's corny.
Let's just say I've been enlightened.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Hey, excuse me.
I'm done fighting you, man.
I know.
Then why are you here?
The double Dutch thing was kind of cool.
Thanks.
For a daddy's boy.
Truce?
Yeah.
Maybe if you teach me that flip
I can use it in the ring.
You got it.
Alright. Now...
All the teams were wonderful.
However, only the top three
can go on to the state finals.
And those teams are...
In third place...
The Kung Fu Flyers!
Congratulations.
Second place...
The Dutch Dragons!
That day, Izzy made a choice.
To do what made him happy.
To not care about
what everyone else thinks,
'cause that's what holds you back.
Izzy taught us something that day.
I'm glad he did,
because it changed my life.
And last, but not least...
...to the best all around
double Dutch team,
based on attitude, teamwork,
sportsmanship,
and total performance score...
- What happened?
- Yeah, don't stop.
Did the Hot Chili Steppers go to state?
- Did Mary and Izzy fall in love?
- Whoa, whoa!
The Hot Chili Steppers went to state.
- They didn't win.
- Aww...
- Until the next year.
- Yay!
- Alright!
- Cool.
- And Mary and Izzy?
- Still going strong.
OK, gear up.
I tell this story to kids all the time.
You really had to be there that day.
- The Hot Chili Steppers!
- Yes!
Yay!
- Mary, Izzy, we did it!
- Yes!
Let's go up there.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
Come on, you can do it.
Just jump in.
- Now?
- Yeah.
Now?
- Now.
- Yes.
- Now?
- Go!
I'm doing it! I'm doing it!
Yeah, Mr. Daniels! Yeah!
Whoo!
