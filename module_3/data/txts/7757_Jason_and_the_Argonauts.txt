- Jason !
- Already Are!
We must   gather the archers
Western Wall...
Lord, the Western Wall has fallen.
- Send them back to the ledge!
- The archers are all dead!
- Majesty!
- Jason ! Thank the gods!
- It is safe!
- No, the enemy surrounded over the palace.
So let's gather
guard and remove them from the palace.
Majesty, we were overwhelmed!
Majesty, Save yourself,
Save your son!
Hera, look for us.
Please hear our prayer.
Gracious lady, mother of the gods,
protect us from the enemy.
Take the boy!
Take it now!
Brother.
I should have known
it would come to this.
I am only here to claim what is mine.
Your claim is false.
I would rather die than see
my kingdom in your hands.
Kill me.
But in the name of your honor,
spare my wife and my child.
Brother, brother, brother.
What do you think I am?
A Savage !
Let me show you...
how  gracious I am in victory.
Only I seek my destiny.
No !
And my destiny is to rule.
The son and heir.
Well, well.
No, please.
Nephew.
Please, he is a child.
Please.
I beg you.
Take it!
Kill him!
Very Impressive.
- Don't say anything.
- There's nothing to say.
your weight should be more
on the front foot.
Yes , I know.
So try again? Or in comings
games, let embarrassment.
No, I have great things more than
games.
Interesting as the Lamb
revolves around the Ursa...
with theta and gamma
leading the way.
Teta and epsilon.
Ofcourse.
I had that dream again.
The gods torment me ,
and I do not know why ?
It's not only a dream, Jason.
It is a memory.
What is this?
It is the emblem of Hera,
It offers Her protection.
It belonged to your mother.
Queen Polymela...
wife of Aeson , King of lolcus .
My father was king?
He was killed by Pelias,
his own brother.
- And my mother?
- She lives.
Why she never sent news?
She did not know where I am?
When Pelias stole the crown,
he took her as his wife and queen.
But you are the
rightful heir of the throne...
and that makes you
mortal enemy of Pelias .
And my mother?
Is she my enemy too ?
Are you alright?
I would like to cross this river...
but it flows so deep and vast.
I will help you,if you like .
Very kind of you, young man.
Where are you bound for , young man?
Lolcus?
- You know it ?
- Yes.
And what do you seek in lolcus?
Not riches, I hope.
No.
Great as it is a very poor country.
Was sucked by their king.
- Pelias?
- Pelias, the tax creator.
Ofcourse searching for the Golden Fleece
it is an expensive endeavor.
The Golden Fleece?
The greatest gift of the gods
to humans.
craved by Pelias ........
He believes that the Fleece
grants his wish.
Your charity will not be forgotten.
Let me
lead the next voyage, my father.
If I see you  ..trust your own son...
- It will make no difference .
Unfortunately, populace have
yet to learn the great benefits
the Fleece will stow upon them.
- What is it ?
- An omen , sir.
of the great importance.
I see a young man.
There is vengeance in his heart.
- He threatens your throne.
- What?
- Another rebel?
- No
- Who, then?
- I do not know .
What is he looks like?
I only know he wears
only one sandal.
I believe, he has protection of the gods.
Find him!
- What do you see?
- He's here, Your Majesty.
In lolcus.
Is it?
I believe so, sir.
What brings you to come to the lolcus, boy?
I came to find my mother.
- Who is your mother?
- Polymela.
Bring her.
How do we know that you are not an impostor?
I have this amulet,
given by my mother .
You know what we do with frauds?
I am not a fraud .
- Called?
- Ah, my dear...
we have a young man here
claims to be your son.
Take a good look at him .
What then?
You know him or not, my dear?
I do not know
And the amulet...
with the emblem of his so beloved Hera?
I've never seen.
Very well .
Take him down.
- We will execute him tomorrow.
- No!
Is something job, remembering,
my dear?
So, how do you find your mother, boy?
It's how you remember?
Or even more beautiful?
Did not know you  have come
back to certain death?
Take him!
My lord,
I beg you to spare him.
Give me one good reason.
Because I find the Golden Fleece.
What?
Leave us.
- My lord.
- Get out! out!
What do you know about the Fleece?
I can find it.
Because I have the protection of the gods.
Tell me
if you bring the Fleece to me ...
... what you expect in return?
- Only my birthright.
Now, dear nephew.
Here is my generous offer:
if you should bring the Fleece back ...
again be Prince and shall be entitled..
in succeession after ny death.
My dad, I protest!
I'm going to give you a boat.
You have to find  a crew.....
It's not easy, but its incentive
will be sensational.
Because, you are not come back in six months...
your mother's life will be forfieted
Very simple,
and is not open to negotiation.
your mother
in exchange for Fleece.
I brought you  something .
- Thank you.
- Jason...
I wish you to say...
do not return.
Promise me you will not return.
I have no choice.
Even though return with the Fleece,
Pelias will kill you.
The Fleece is his obsession.
He believes
perform his greatest desire.
What is it?
Immortality.
Eternal Freedom of death
so you can reign forever.
He will not let you to live.
You know your husband well
I had to learn his vice.
For my sake and for you.
Who has not been in vain.
The finest and fastest ship ever built
And the most expensive.
- Is she not? Master Argos?
- and she is ,Majesty, but she is the best
we've ever designed.
Each joint is perfect,
each nail well placed.
We need now the crew of worthy...
What is it called?
Pelias.
It seemed natural. although...
I am not sure now
it provides sufficient inspiration.
Your Majesty...
I suggest "The Great Wave"
in honor of its speed?
Or may be "Argo" in honor
the man who built it?
Oh, I like that.
I do not know what to say.
It's the least we can do,
I mean considering...
you will be sailing  .....
- I, sir?
- You sir.
Of course, sir.
Goddess Hera, hear my prayer.
Protect my darling son, Jason.
East it safely.
Protect him from his youth.
Zeus, my lord.
What is ..from my bed?
Affairs of mortals, Queen Hera.
Affairs with mortals,
I believe.
- And what is the nature of your complaint today?
- I know you have been chasing mortal women .
You will hear me!
Do you think I'm blind?
Humiliate ..a goddess  when ..
with the mortals.
Don't you think, your duty
is to obey.
Otherwise, descend on Earth
and stick her with his spite.
Do not tempt me.
Seeking men who know the sea.
But only the best...
those willing to face dangers...
and prepared to risk all in search...
the Golden Fleece.
In choosing the ..
I promise you honor and glory.
I'll take him outside and ...
Who are you?
Why did you hit me?
The guy behind you
carrying a knife, and would have used.
Why?
You mentioned the Fleece. Nothing
wise sailors in company.
But I have to find the crew.
I will come
I can pull alone .
I'm no sailor, but...
That's it.
These are farmers, campesinos., ..
Do not serve.
- Who is this man?
- Laertes, a shepherd.
What do you think?
Sir, I understand the need of a crew, but...
So, you like dangers ?
- I said  to keep into the side, not here.
- You said "in the middle".
-No, I said it , Here!
- Where?
- Here!
- It seems to be hard work.
Have you ever been in the sea?
No , you ?
- Where?
- The sea.
- When?
- Does not matter.
- How?
Boat!
No, never.
A drunk, a shepherd,
two cavouqueiros...
who never rode a saddle,
they gave a node or held an oar.
They have heart.
- they must be more like them.
- I hope not.
The sea is merciless ...
and can only get by
skill and experience .
Without that, you invite death.
Not sail with this crew.
It was the order of Pelias,
on pain of death.
So my death will be quick.
alright , rest!
Hello, young man.
How are these strong legs?
Do not you remember me?
You helped me cross the river.
Ofcourse.
I told your charity
would be rewarded.
Go to  Archas, the map-maker.
He will show you the way to the
Golden Fleece.
Thank you.
What is this young man to you?
A toy?
to Play with him  just to spite
Pelias?
Why?
because , you are jealous.
Because heworships Poseidon
not you?
It's what you think, great Zeus?
That my affection is caused by jealousy...
rather than by their youthful beauty?
rather than  her thighs as soft
and strong as an olive branch?
- Enough!
- Or his lips...
as sweet as...
Listen here.
That his smooth face ..  insolent "baby"
Whatever try ..relay on it .
I will make them...
10,000 times more difficult!
Oh ! Don't stop.
- play on, please.
- There's a price.
A place in a ship.
- What do you know of the sea?
- Nothing.
Facing the sea without knowledge
or ability,  brings only death.
Death .... ble
Danger,I do not fear  and can
entertain you with music.
Music to tame the beasts...
raises the hearts of men to heaven
and makes the lark singing.
- What's your name?
- Orpheus.
- What can I do you for?
- I am looking for a map.
I have many maps.
I am looking for a map that
only  leads me to  Golden Fleece.
If such a map exists,
it would have great price.
This is all I have.
Keep it.
It will be more useful to you than to me. Come in.
What do you know about the stars?
I learned a little about them.
- I've never seen a map like this.
- There is no map like this.
Read it well,
and it will take you to the end of the world.
Sagittarius...
Signess and Delfino....
and this a chart.
A chart .. stars.
No map takes you to the Fleece.
It lies in unknown sea.
But follow this chart
and it will take you to the Tabletop Island.
There you will find the
prophet Fineas .
It is said that he knows the secret of
Fleece.
How to pass thro' water such a map?
With the help of my son
and apprentice , Zetes.
The gods given him  eyes
10 times sharper than the eagle.
and you can see other way
the end of the world?
Only the heavens . the great
formation of the constellations.
I need someone such as
... my crew
will be...
but Zetes has a job to do here...
which he should be doing now.
May the Gods
Speed your way!
Thanks for this.
Stop!
Somebody stop him !
Stop!
Is this is what we're looking for?
I thank the gods.
- And you so.
- My pleasure .
- What is that?
- A map.
Where this lead you ?
To Fineas Island and from there,
Golden Fleece.
So you're the young captain?
Men say you are a fool.
Just to hide fear and cowardice.
Do you share their opinion?
Do you know with whom you speak?
Follow me.
Get more men.
Dig aroud.
Who are you?
I am Hercules.
This boat will find the Golden Fleece.
And I am going  with it!
Are you heroes or
are you cowards?
I will go
- and I.
- and I.
-and I !
- and I .
Remember me, sir?
- you are looking as thief !
- Reformed thief , sir.
- Since when?
- Since this morning, sir.
Nicelooking .... sir.
My amulet?
Yes  , a good will
on my part.
- I'd like to come with you.
- Why?
To improve myself ,sir
....... .
- Give me a chance, sir.
- For what?
you can steal  as .. thief ?
Well, better to take
the Fleece than a thief?
So ... Mopsus?
A drink to our journey?
No, sir.
I vowed never to drink again.
What do you think of this Jason?
He talks well.
Let's see how sails.
My last job was the most difficult.
I had to spoon the Hespéride golden apples.
Atlas, my friend...
was the only Titan high enough
to reach them.
I held the weight of the heavens
in his den.
- to the end of the world?
- What did your father say?
I haven't told him.
- A Musician?
- Yes.
Here you are, sir musician.
In the water!
In the water!
Jason!
What are you doing here?
- I am coming with you.
- You can not.
Really?
not a Woman
Slag!
Look at them.
It was 10 days.
Keep in time !
Zetes!
Accompany barrel.
Look at the man before him.
Come on!
- Come back here! Come here!
- Kill him.
What does this asshole
is doing on board?
- Let's throw it overboard.
- Why?
Because he is the king's son.
We hate you!
- Really?
- You!
We can nail it to the mast and let
seagulls pluck out his eyes.
Silence!
Equion, save it!
What are you doing now !
Do as he says!
There will be no blood shed on board.
Watch out for him.
Is as elusive as a snake.
He's my brother.
We want  back to the oars!
Do not blame them for hating me.
It is my father's reputation .
It is a curse to me.
A curse I wish to undo.
First sail with you,
'll get rid of that reputation.
How is that ?
If we have the Fleece...
we may get rid of a tyrant, a monster.
if you have with the Fleece,
you can destroy him.
If I have the Fleece , bound to give to your  father.
Tmy mother's life is at stake or not
's Why I'm here,
to help our mother.
Jason, because of this bargain,
I will learn what my father really is.
A ship.
A lone ship
Why?
What does this mean?
Where is this ship?
Far yet.
In a sea beyond our knowledge...
beyond our reach.
Why are you smiling?
It's a good omen?
It's a bad omen?
This young man...
He has a  pleasant face.
What are you doing?
Salt, fine.
Place salt.
Do not put too much pepper.
Pepper too...
See yourself in the air
and keep this picture in mind.
Yours legs are like springs.
Your arms are like wings.
The bull's eye is upon us.
Soon we'll leave the map of the waters.
This not filled with admiration?
Yes.
- What do you see?
- Nothing.
It's as if the gods ..
blind before our eyes.
Argos, Are we ..
straight course ?
I'm doing to the best of my ability.
but without a landmark,
nor sun to guide us...
Rocks ! still left!
still left!
- Earth!
- Earth!
Hercules, Equion, Orpheus, come
with me. The rest stay here.
There should be no island here.
Jason !
Go back to the oars!
Is Poseidon!
The god of the sea!
Where is Jason?
Jason!
Jason!
Jason !
Hold on , Equion !
Equion, hold on !
Jason!
Where is Jason?
Stop!
We must search for Jason!
Get out of here!
Enough!
Enough!
Brother Poseidon...
our apologies.
Jason?
- The other...
Equion was lost
So ,Hercules .
Hercules!
- What have I done?
Demote yourself..
This boy would  sleep with a prostitute...
... to honor you .
- Judge him not, by your own principles.
Watch!
The mast is bent.
Front boards touch the line
which means water line.. ,
which means the fund is rising .
And that's not all.
They are also splintering .
And, sir...
We have lost the map.
To the oars!
Let's lower the sail!
Tie! Tie!
Hold tight!
Put down the candle!
Remem full force!
Is bad.
It is Very  bad.
The boat is destroyed, Jason.
Let's find wood.
We will make the repairs.
We haven't got the tools.
What about our hunting party?
Nothing like fresh roast venison
to cherish ....
Soldiers.
Soldiers!
Form a phalanx!
Come on!
Wait!
Zetes?
Are all women?
All women.
Welcome to Lemnos.
Majesty, Prince Jason.
Our Queen, Hipsípile.
Welcome.
I understand that you
require some our materials?
Only a few things.
A little wood...
... and cloth for sailing.
- Of course.
You are welcome .
My gratitude Majesty.
This is how a garden
is more beautiful, is not it?
A garden...
should be the wild...
should be fertile.
We feel the force
creating it.
We will drink wine...
made from my own vines.
Young and strong.
You can feel the earth it...
Taste of their wealth.
In my room working, I
to hunt the boar Eurimanto.
Imagine a boar.
It's huge, hairy...
hateful.
- It is Pollux.
- It is Castor.
We are simple people.
He's foreman,
I am stone sculptor.
Stones Carver?
- Where are all the men?
- Fighting.
- Really? Against whom?
- Been so long that I have forgotten.
Please.
Where is Jason?
Why are not you with the others?
The other men
seem to havetheir senses.
- But you...
- I have an advantage.
- My senses are numb.
- Why?
I had a love.
Eurydice...
whose laughter was as soft as the rain...
and eyes as bright as the sky
I lost her ...
to death.
To lose her was like losing a
universe.
If the Fleece can grant a man's desire,
It will make it  me  another chance.
Perhaps to love what
can not be yours is a wound...
that only death can heal.
I'm done, Argos.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Let's see what the future holds.
What do you say?
I suggest you be the king.
What is this?
Nothing.
Nothing?
He said "nothing"?
It seems that you have been...
forgotten.
Oh most beloved goddess ...
Here are and accept the coming sacrifice.
A sacrifice of men!
Tonight, we  feast.
Tonight , we  enjoy !
For it is my wish ...
that every man of the Argo...
take a wife  from my people.
I would make you princess of this island...
And your leader...
king!
Let us go to the temple tonight...
and celebrate the promise...
of eternal happiness.
Jason!
Jason! It's a trap.
They are going to kill you .
I had been to the temple .
I know what they are planning.
A sacrifice of men!
fools!
Don't you see here ?
Men also not there .
're Dead!
Look!
This is their armor!
- Absurd .
- Why she is saying such ridiculous things?
She loves you.
She loves you and wants
you to make her own .
Do not let the envy of it
erode our love.
Remove her !
Jason!
No, wait!
Wait.
This is not the purpose of our voyage
What you'll find in your voyage
that you can not find here ?
I promise you infinite happiness.
Perhaps we should go back to the boat.
Run!
What are your orders, sir?
You decide.
I am not the captain.
The boat is almost sinking.
We are lost.
We have no food...
water.
I do not know what to do.
There are two dozen men here
who trusted you...
and Ever Trust
to show leadership.
Forget you own troubles...
Remember ,
you are the son of a king...
Dam well !
Do your duty.
Hera...
I ask you...
please show me a sign.
Any thing .
It comes with a purpose
in his heart.
Is the Fleece that attracts.
The Fleece.
The Fleece?
Fight like a woman general.
Where is your thirst for battle?
Pehaps you'd relieve him from his command?
Father, I must speak with you urgently.
- It is concerned with our security.
- After.
It concerns the Fleece.
Where is this young man
with pleasant face?
Closer than you have been told .
search your course
toward the unknown sea.
I'll find him for you , Father.
And I will destroy him.
Boar with honey sauce.
With onions.
A little salt, tarragon.
-  perhaps be fried onions.
- My God!
- Castor.
- What?
- I'm hungry.
- Me too. Its you too ...
onions!
And, everybody row!
If we don't row , we  die!
Would not mind rowing
we actually knew where we're going.
It is what we choose.
We none of us  prisoners.
Even prisoners are fed!
With your pardon, sir...
but where are we now ?
- We are in the East of Lemnos.
- Yes, but where is it?
We seek Fineas in Mesa Island.
Forgive me for asking sir,
but how do we find this island...
since we have no map?
Its function is to paddle,
not ask questions!
I do not mind rowing...
If it is to go somewhere.
- Do we know where we're going, sir?
- This is mad.
We should turn back.
Before we starve to die !
Zetes!
- Sir !
- I need to see the stars!
I remember from the map...
the island lies just
under the place in the heavens ...
with the dog
we will search of the archer.
Show me where it is,
get there by night before.
if not, we shall turn back .
But, sir, It is  day light.
How should I see the Heavens?
Have faith in your strength.
Yes!
Yes, I see them!
I do!
Draw for me!
Draw what you see!
This way!
Argonauts, get your oars!
We will see this way to land !
I'm sure of it !
To the oars!
To the oars!
Land!
I see the land !
It is an island!
Chata, made a tabletop.
Well done , young master.
Split and look for
Fineas in different directions.
We need food,
not prophets.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Lord! Lord!
Demons! Demons!
Demons type...
We saw food, sir.
In the temple.
- Easy, one at a time. Fano?
- Sir, there is a temple up there.
There's food in it.
There are also creatures that devoured
Butes and Tífis!
We must leave this place !
We can not leave
We must find Fineas.
Indeed !
You have to find him .
Here is ..Jason's lolcus...
... I am Fineas.
- How do you know who I am?
I am a seer
My gift is great.
I know what you are seeking , young man.
So you can help us?
I have been 40 years on this island,
exiled by the gods.
In their jealousy of my gifts,
they tore my eyes.
And, for good measure, they placed me here...
to be tormented by hunger and Harpies.
Harpies?
Monsters.
They are part of my torment.
The other part is hunger.
Perpetual hunger.
A full table of food every day...
but to touch it, it is death.
Can you show the way for the Golden Fleece?
I can put you in the right direction...
for the price of a small favor.
The Fleece is in Colchis...
kingdom of Aertes.
What do you know of him?
It is a merciless tyrant...
His daughter, Medea, is a sorceress
has powers to protect him.
She is the guardian of the Fleece.
How do we find Colchis?
My young man ...
You must enter the Eastern Ocean.
And there's but one way...
through the dark rocks.
Doomed, all
who have gone before you.
Man overboard!
The boat is sunk.
The crew drowned.
I see bodies.
crushed...
and sucked down.
Is your brother  dead?
No !
He is .
He is saved.
He is saved by one of
which are loved by the gods.
It is he,who desires
the Golden Fleece.
Rocks...
sank my ship.
We spent among them.
They came together...
and crushed my ship .
crushed my ship with me
the bow without any warning.
No one warned me.
How would I know?
I'm Jason, Prince of lolcus.
Apsirto of Colchis.
Colchis?
That's where we're going.
You are !
Then I may be able to help you.
My father is the ruler of Colchis.
I believe,he will receive you well.
First, however...
we must find a route that takes us  safely there.
Do You know any?
No
But I do know to go through
these rocks is certain death.
Orpheus...
... we need your dove.
- Why?
Fly through , little friend.
May the Gods guide you .
Row !
rowing sound !
rowing sound !
rowing sound !
rowing sound !
rowing sound !
This is  death!
death!
A great darkness.
I see nothing.
And the ship?
There is no ship.
It is gone.
I see only reckage ...
darkness.
The ship is lost.
Lost?
Indeed.
Killer!
You are the Killer!
Eros, god of love,
I give you a task.
Find the princess Medea.
Shoot your arrow...
so she delivered
the heart to Jason...
Prince of lolcus.
Jason?
But, lady...
- It's my wish.
- But why?
What was he doing here?
Hold them up !
Hold them up !
These men are armed
and prepared for war.
It is an honor guard,
to honor the guests .
Earth!
Sir, with this gentleman
be aware.
- Why?
- His tongue seems very sharp.
I am going to the shore.
I have to take two men.
- I am going with you.
- No, Hercules.
- You'll be watching the boat.
- My place is at you side.
You may stay better  here.
If things are in mess,
you're my only saver.
I would go with you, to protect you  , sir.
And I will come with you.
I will go down with our host,
Prince Apsirto.
Hercules will be my lieutenant.
Follow his orders
as if are mine.
Come on! Come on!
Apparently, I am indebted
with you, young prince.
It is our custom to pay our debts
in kind...
no gifts..but there is this
that equals the firstborn.
Sir, you do have in your domain
a treasure that would be dearer to me.
What a treasure would be so dear!
Son!
The Golden Fleece.
sir, we have come in peace.
No,
they came to rob me and you should pay.
Father, remember that
you are indebted to him.
Killing him now
may anger  the gods.
Let the gods decide his fate.
Give him a task that
no mortal can complete.
Yes, my daughter. It should
face Minnean bull.
You will harness the reins
Minnean bull...
Plow the field Ares
and sow the dragon's teeth.
If you live, I'll know that the god's
faith in you, and you will have...
The Golden Fleece.
- Can not sleep?
- No
Neither I am..
I'm concerned.
Really?
.. knows about a robber.
I  myself  a robber you see!
- Only walk the thieves company.
- You never stop talking?
Look here ...

Also onion!
Fried onion.
And tarragon.
Does anyone have honey sauce?
Lovely ,isn't it?
I do Majesty.
A trophy from Liciana campaign.
But there is no prize
greater than the Fleece.
I was younger than you when
I led my army to win it.
Once held,
I recognize its power.
The Fleece keeps
State and loyalty
When I asked my Mother to give
their sons' life, they granted ..
of the Fleece.
When I ask my generals
to fight to the last...
they do, because
own the Fleece.
My enemies scrarcely raise the sword to me.
It has granted my heart's desire.
My daughter is very beautiful,
don't you think , Jason?
I do ,  Majesty.
You will have the Fleece,
and you may have it if you wish .
Majesty, I never deserve ...
Medea if this young
ask your hand in marriage...
... Would you grant?
- Majesty...
recognize that his gaze.
I also have heart.
I would say "yes."
Good , let us set up .
Noble men of Colchis !
There use to be a union between
the home lolcus and Colchis house
Jason, Prince hero...
will marry Medea,
our princess.
- But, Your Majesty...
- There is no need to thank me.
Ofcourse,You inderstand that neither you nor
the Fleece can leave Colchis.
I am sure you will be very happy here.
Satisfied?
With what?
- Her new husband.
- Apsirto.
So, I was right .
You are in league with our father.
No
I love Jason.
It's all very clear now.
So clear.
How can you love him ?
You do not know.
I know you.
I do not mean to hurt you.
But it hurts.
He wants to marry her,
with the princess Medea.
He wants to marry her,
with the princess Medea.
No
Jason never stay here.
It does not send us away
saying nothing.
He will never abandon us.
May be our quest is finished
and it is here that we must part.
Can you believe it?
Jason surrendered himself to Colchis...
... and this princess?
- She is very beautiful.
Actually, she is very beautiful.
You fools! They lost faith?
I do not think Jason
abandon us...
he would forfiet his quest...
What does she means to him ?
What does she means to us ? ...
And without Atalanta!
We must .... rescue  him.
From what?
Of great wealth? Power?
- The woman he loves?
- He does not love her!
How do you know?
Look, I'm just saying,
if that's his wish ...
... we should respect it and go.
- I agree.
Simply go back?
We have travelled far,
to the ends of the earth.
What more can we achieve?
We were asked
to get the Fleece.
Our mission is incomplete.
But our mission was to follow Jason,
and he wants us to go.
- I think we should go.
- No, Hercules!
- Have them stay!
- I can not.
It is between each man
and his consciousness.
Consciousness?
This word has meaning
to any of you?
We will put  it to the vote.
Jason,this will soothe your wounds.
Why doyou wish to help ?
You, the guardian of the Fleece.
The Fleece will  only give its true
powers who really deserve.
It is for them to guard its secrets.
Worthy or not,
I find it.
My mother's life depends on it.
So you should know
I can not be a party from it.
Treason! Treason!
Treason ! Your beloved ..
your trustee ...
of the future ruler
- What is your reason for coming here, Apsirto?
- The Fleece.
The Fleece.
They want to take it away from us.
Tonight.
Tell me everything you know.
My lady Medea...
and Jason.
Mancomunados.
She will take him to the Fleece...
and he will steal it and take it to his boat.
I heard his move.
I heard from the back door while they were making love
and matched his betrayal.
you were Drunk, my son.
Do not act like a fool.
Tonight father...
It is you who are the fool !
Jason can walk on water? Look.

Let's return to the palace!
Come on! Come on!
Stay together!
Jason!

May be not yours, but certainly
my father's. Kill him.
Attack!
Attack!
Argo is north of here, sir.
Quick, sir.
Soon we will be discovered.
My task was to free the man,
eating birds of the marshes.
These birds,
sent by Aries...
ahowere over men
their feathers and their lethal droppings.
Predictably,
I once again, saved the day.
- Let's go down.
- It will take a lot.
Their archers will hit us like flies.
Cavalry, a mile away!
Let's fight them.
We will fight them to the last...!
No need for that .
- Hercules.

I'm going to hold the enemy
while you escape.
Head to the Argo.
It is at the mouth of the river.
- I see it .

Where is Fleece?
- Crossing the throat, on a plateau.
- There is no time.
's Work for a full day

You! Start climbing!
Wait.
I think there is another way.

Laertes, show them what to do.

- Not without you.
- I will follow.
Come, I'll help you.
This is not my destiny.
Not you face an entire army!

That's what my mother demands.
- Mother?
- I am Hercules...
Servant of Hera !
commanded by  her...
to protect you.
Go, Jason, my dear friend,

Lord, Acastus is wounded.
I think, you go on .
I just need some rest.
No, Take it to the side

- A knot around his neck.
Orpheus, you need to play.
As never played before!
Be careful , Jason!
Jason!
Jason!
No !
Jason!
Jason!
Someone needs to pull the arrow.
I need someone with good hands.
I do.
Take out the arrow gently
and pull firmly.
It is close to the heart.

perhaps you found a use for them.
No longer lead you
a hundred victories?
When we had the Fleece.
Have faith in your king.
Your Music is changed.
You have a good ear.
What will the
gods are wanting?
Saves with a miracle
one who wants his own end...
die but leave those who love life.

- Anything.
Jason, I know you ...
I love you better than anyone
on this Earth.
- And I you .

Of course!
Thank the gods!
I did not think it was the same way!
- How could you think such a thing?
- I thought you and Medea...
Medea and I will get married.
But you will always be so dear
to me as a sister.
Yes
Yes, of course..
You love real?
It is written.
Argos?
What?
My father was murdered.
How can you be sure?
I'm sorry.
I too saw my father's death.
It is the most distant memory,
but the most vivid I have.
Still burning in my soul.
I shall Never let you feel alone.
Mortal love.
Pure...
incorruptible.
As it should be.
You don't fool me.
Is suffering inside, cursing his nobility.
And what you know about nobility?
I'll show you.
I will be kind to you.
Who are you?
I know your face, but...
His slave.
Someone who admires the distance...
and can not find,
even in heaven...
greater majesty that it
see before me.
- You are a god?
- Certainly.
I am the king of the gods.
Still, I'm your slave.
Medea Medea Medea...

A boy!
I am Zeus.
It is the inevitable.
I am...

I am the king never dies.
And you should be my queen.
What you want from me?
Lie with me.
No, I can not.
Not only my body but my soul
immortal belongs to the man I love.
There is no greater power.
You disown me?
For the boy?
I give you time to reconsider hey,
before your beauty feneça.
You are alright ?
I do not know.
Why are you smiling?
From what I'm feeling.
Whatever happens,
have faith in our love.
They embarrassed us.
- We arrived!
- Earth!
Can not be!
Welcome to lolcus.
- My son!
- Father!
Ai..s, it is good to see you.
It's a... It's a miracle!
We thought we were lost...
... all dead!
- Ai...s, I must ask you not to spread...
the news of our return.
The safety of my mother is still...
... my biggest concern.
- Your mother?
- Oh my God ! you do not know ,
- What?
Sir, I must tell you.
Your mother, the Queen is no more.
What?
She's dead, sir.
- How?
He took her life...
in the house of.....
that of your father.
I see.
If we fear the betrayal of Pelias,
can use the darkness against him.
and Wastie more lives in this endeavor
Then ,What is your intention?
My intention, brother...
is to drink.
Drink all of those should be
drinking us.
The Équio.
The Laertes, the brave athlete.
The Tífis...
the Butes...
Fano.
And Hercules...
the mighty and magnificent.
Lord, they would not have died in vain
to meet your destiny.
You are..sir,
still the rightful king of lolcus .
We may still rescue  from tyranny...
and avenge your father's and mother's lives.
For what purpose?
In the first sunbeam, depart.
- Sir, I beg you.
- Enough!
Jason...
Not honor the dead
turning her back to life.
So we disappointed.
Come, Zetes.
It's time to go home.
Son?
Father, I can not.
- But son...
- I can not leave my friends.
Look at the stars.
They will be your guide.
What is showing me...
Hercules, old friend?
A drink for my friend Mopsus?
No
Know I do not drink.
I am greatly in grief about your mother.
I knew her, you know?
Very well.
Really?
I admired her beauty...
and humiliated by its gentleness.
May be...
just one little ...
If not now, when ?
Let's drink another.
We are in need.
Hera...
Why you did not protect her?
Jason...
Jason, my dear son.
That, for mercy of the gods,
can tell you the underworld.
Jason, you are not at the end of your journey,
but the beginning.
The path is you who chooses.
Go in peace, my dear.
Go with your mother's love ...
And fulfill your destiny.
Gone!
Gone!
Sir, Your son is back!
Let me pass.
Welcome, my son.
I was not expecting.
I sailed with Jason and gained the Fleece.
So, I see.
Its power is mine.
I am now king.
Ofcourse.
How can I resist the power of Fleece?
Acastus...
I am...
old and tired.
More tired than you can imagine.
But you...
you proved a man.
A better man than perhaps I thought.
Please
want to give you my blessing.
Come here, son.
My dear son.
My son.
My son.
Go out to the gods,
my son.
Dear...
dear son.
Quick, sir.
The crowd is restless.
Find my nephew, Jason...
and all who sailed with him.
Destroy them!
Yes, my lord.
Jason!
Where have you been?
The Fleece is gone.
Acastus and Medea as well.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, it was my fault.
- Where is Medea?
- With Acastus , Probably.
Maybe that was their plan.
The boy betrayed us, for sure.
- Are you sure that Medea was with him?
- As far as we know.
- See how she cured him with witchcraft.
- It was not witchcraft!
It was mercy.
What is certain, sir, that is
Pelias is with the Fleece...
and he knows
our arrival.
What are the orders, sir?
- The Argo is ready to sail.
- Great! The faster, the better.
Soldiers are approaching!
I shall not blame men
if you stay not with me.
Much has demanded of you...
too much perhaps .
But I can not escape.
I must make my stay here.
I'm staying, sir.
Me too.
Me too.
Me, too too .
Need you ask?
Argos, I can not ask
you to stand against his master Pelias .
Jason, you are my master now .
Cavalry , a mile away ,
about 200 men!
We must hurry!
Sir, I must tell you ...
I know a way to get into the palace itself ...
... That would give us the effect of surprise.
- Tell me .
There is a tunnel, a passage
into the temple.
The entrance is deep in the forest,
but I believe I can locate it .
It is kind to us  once before ...
when I was captain
of the Palace Guard...
captain of your father, Jason.
I was I who took the temple
and handed Chiron.
Of course! The soldier!
I owe my life to you!
No, sir, do not owe me anything.
Just I could not save your father from danger
so, I told you  today.
Tell me about the tunnel.
The entrance is outside of the city.
Its opened by a key...
a key that is on the amulet
that your mother gave you.
I lost the amulet.
I lost in Lemnos.
- Without the key, it would be impossible.
- Is there no other way?
No
So, I ...
We can use the key.
I thought.
In Lemnos.
I was told that its a good piece .
- In some value.
- Worth a kingdom, I should say.
Swear by the gods that was
the last thing stolen in my life!
Lead us, Mopsus.
Is the kingdom for you , or for her?
They are same to me .
I am Medea...
daughter Edia...
daughter of Frixo.
I am of the blood of the Fleece.
I'm your guardian on earth,
and only through me...
may receive his power.
Why should I believe you?
Majesty, it is true that Edia
was a great sorceress...
and possessed the  powers of Healing .
Impressive.
I draw  my powers from Fleece.
Where is the Fleece, I will.
Really?
Why
powers are not working for me?
Because I give to the Fleece my blessing .
Only through me and blood
of Frixo you will receive its power.
And what you want in return?
Be your wife and guardian
of the Fleece forever.
That is my destiny.
Pelias soldiers.
Jason!
Argos!
Argos!
Jason, leave it !
Come on!
You must bathe in these waters.
They will release the powers of the Fleece.
Then you will be once more young...
and you would rule forever.
Majesty, we have no guarantee.
- How do we  know if the water is safe?
- You will come first.
Go.
I see where from  fleece has come ?
Has he brought it as per your desire ?
Has its power revived you ?
Will I look like a immortal ?
The Fleece has no power...
except that
imagined by those who seek it.
We make our own destiny...
... by our own actions .
- This is trickious !
The only trickory lies in your imagination.
How many have died ,so
you may gain the Fleece?
and what has it brought you?
My sword is  in your throat...
and your people begging for your blood.
You'll kill me?
I am disgusted with this slaughter...
and touched by mercy.
May you never know
the disappointment of old age .
How my mind is mad with this Fleece.
My son is dead, my  kingdom is lost.
Take the Fleece and do what you want.
Take it with my blessing,
but have mercy on me...
before you meet
your destination.
My destiny...
's to rule!
I Swear to his queen
my loyalty and faith.
And as for also also swear you that we
shall serve our people and our state...
to bring such harmony , Your Honour
as if we are in the heaven.
