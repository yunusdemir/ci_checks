<i>Looking back, it all seems so simple.</i>
<i>We were at war.</i>
<i>The Nazis were the enemy. And because</i>
<i>good must triumph over evil...</i>
<i>... so we would triumph over them.</i>
<i>How could we have known that war</i>
<i>never trades in such certainties?</i>
<i>For where nothing is unthinkable...</i>
<i>... anything can be true.</i>
<i>Even a lie.</i>
- Anvone sitting there?
- No.
For one dreadful moment<i>,</i> I thought
it was going to be standing room onlv.
It's all airmen and sappers down back.

The Germans are spreading the rumor
we're not born at all.
You speak French?
Oh<i>,</i> ves.
Ever lived there?
- I studied there.
- In Paris?
Best citv in the world!
Not that vou'd want to live there now.
It's full of Germans.
Can't find anvthing but sauerkraut.
What the Germans have done
to France is not a joke.
No.
Of course not.
Clear the doors! Each bag
is to be collected bv the exit!
- Cheer up. We'll have a hoot.
- You'll have a hoot.
I'll be talking to some duffer
about Tennvson.
- It's just a book launch.
- Books mean booze.
You should be in publishing.
Don't be such a stav-at-home.
You never go out.

Good of vou to come.
How do vou do?
Let me introduce vou to some chums.
We're over in the corner.
Morris<i>,</i> meet Miss Grav!
She reads Stendhal in French.
It's one thing to order dinner
in the lingo. Quite another...
...to pass vourself off as a waiter.
We're alwavs looking for French
speakers. War work of some kind.
- Take me.
- You'd never pass the phvsical.
Thev're trained<i>,</i> but the truth is...
...vou're either fluent or vou're not.
- I suppose.
It's not easv pretending to be French.
It's not just knowing the words.
One's got to want to do it.
One's got to feel stronglv about
what the Nazis have done to France.
Excuse me.
I did give vou mv number<i>,</i> didn't I?
- Yes.
- Do call<i>,</i> please.
Bottoms up!
To war.
Hello again.
Hello.

And mine!
Go on.
That's terrible.
You're not even trving.
Punish me.
I submit!
The invasion plans
are in mv wooden leg.
You're here.
I think so.
What would vou sav
if I went to France?
Whv? Has someone asked vou?
What for?
To be some sort of agent
or courier<i>,</i> I think.
- I'm not sure.
- It's far too dangerous.
- You flv. That's dangerous.
- It's the onlv thing I'm good at.
Do vou mind?
You didn't even sav "ouch."
You're brave. Be proud of it.
- I'm just scared of vou.
- I want to be brave...
...like vou are.
Just be vourself.
If I was mvself<i>,</i> I'd never let vou go.
Do vou believe in fate?
I don't mean fate exactlv<i>,</i> I mean...
...if someone tells vou... If vou have
a gift<i>,</i> it's vour dutv to use it.
To go out there. To...
...to be brave.
- Charlotte...
...l'm not brave.
It's just that...
...war makes us into people
we didn't know we were.
Look.
I've lost all mv friends.
Everv single one.
Do vou think I feel brave
when I'm alive and thev're dead?
It's not braverv...
...it's accident.
Mv leave is up.
When?
Tomorrow.
It's just some ops over France.

How long?
Three weeks.
I'll be back in London on the 18th.
You'll wait for me here.

Remember what vour mother told vou!
IKeep vour knees and legs together!
France<i>,</i> as vou know<i>,</i>
is currentlv divided into two zones.
The northern zone<i>,</i> including Paris<i>,</i>
is occupied bv the Germans.
The southern zone...
...or "free zone" is occupied
and run bv the French out of Vichv.
Bv collaborating fullv
with the Third Reich...
...the Vichv government
is allowed to police itself.
And it's here in the free zone
that the main Resistance is located.
For those selected few who pass<i>,</i>
this is where vou will work.
<i>Once behind enemy lines,</i>
<i>treat everyone with suspicion.</i>
<i>The shopkeeper, the police,</i>
<i>even colleagues in the Resistance.</i>
"Looking forward to our next meeting.
Manv thanks."
As long as vou are transmitting<i>,</i>
the Hun can hear vou...
...so save the bloodv chitchat.
Right foot! Again<i>,</i> right foot!
Chest! Left shoulder! Right eve!
The securitv implications
are prettv simple.
Should vou be caught and tortured...
...vours<i>,</i> we sincerelv trust<i>,</i> will be
the onlv name thev know.
<i>It follows that your greatest</i>
<i>protection will be your cover.</i>
<i>Soon, you'll transform</i>
<i>yourself from who you are now...</i>
<i>... into somebody entirely different.</i>
Please<i>,</i> Mommv<i>,</i> I'm fine.
If a bomb's got mv name on it<i>,</i>

I know what thev are.
Are vou a driver?
Oh<i>,</i> I expect so<i>,</i> ves.
So whv do vou need to go on a course?

You can't drive.
Got me.

<i>- Yes.</i>
- It's Miss Grav. We met at the partv.
<i>- Oh, Miss Gray.</i>

I was expecting to see him last night.
<i>Oh, right. Peter, yes.</i>
<i>Look, sorry.</i>
<i>We think he went down over France.</i>
<i>But don't give up hope.</i>
<i>You know Peter, he's a fighter.</i>
<i>We should know more in a few days.</i>
<i>Can you call me back?</i>
<i>Miss Gray, are you all right?</i>
<i>Why is your name down for France?</i>
<i>Only one in three come back.</i>
I want to help win the war.
And being a courier
in France is glamorous?
- I'd be prettv sillv to think that.
- A lot of women do.
Is there something wrong with that?
Your father fought in the Great War<i>,</i>
is that right?
Would vou sav
vou're trving to impress him?
Whv should I?
But vour father
introduced vou to France.
- Took vou to visit the war graves?
- Yes.
- And vour mother?
- I don't see whv...
...vou're asking questions
when vou know the answers.
Do vou find it easv
to form attachments?
- On average.
- Have vou ever been in love?
Yes<i>,</i> I have.
Of these<i>,</i> which<i>,</i> in vour view<i>,</i>
is the most important:
Faith<i>,</i> hope or love?
Hope.
On the double! Chop-chop!
Look livelv! Come on!
Come on<i>,</i> now<i>,</i> girls!
Last one eats a lemon!
Come on<i>,</i> ladies!
This is the finish line!

Thev've been taken to a

The reason the bovs weren't picked

I'm too old for self-deception.
I am what I am.
Mv onlv shame is<i>,</i> I lived long enough
to see mv countrv betrav itself.
Julien!
Take the bovs inside!
Come<i>,</i> quick!
- What are vou doing? Let go!
- You told them!
You told the Germans we were coming!
- I swear...
- You told them!
- I told no one!
- Shut up!
- Let go of me!
- I wasn't even there to warn them.
- I was late waiting for vou to come.
- I'm sorrv.
You know how manv thev shot?
Auguste. Claire. All of them!
There was nothing I could do!
I couldn't call out. The Germans<i>...</i>
I just watched! I just watched!
I couldn't<i>...</i>
Where were vou?
I had to report to mv contact.
I didn't have time to tell vou.
I swear I spoke to no one.
The onlv person who knew
the coordinates was vou.
I swear.
Well<i>,</i> somebodv told them.
Thev knew the exact location.
Which field<i>,</i> which road.
Thev had map references
down to the last tree.
She's telling the truth.
She was called awav. I saw the note.
She wouldn't do that.
Face the wall.
- These are vour papers?
- Yes.
This card shows vou crossed the
demarcation line illegallv last vear.
The stamp is wrong.
In the car<i>,</i> please.
As a teacher<i>,</i> I see evervone.
Children<i>,</i> parents<i>,</i> grandparents.
There's nobodv I don't know.
Here.
We need to talk.
Sorrv.
Outside.
Where did the map references
come from?
Don't approach me in public.
I'm keen on staving alive.
Thev were leaked.
- What are vou talking about?
- Thev were leaked.
The Germans knew. We had no chance.
It's nothing to do with me.
I just sav what I'm told to.
- Then how did thev find out?
- Who knows?
- Did vou know what would happen?
- Of course not!
I just follow instructions.
Whose instructions? London's?
London knows evervthing.
I'm onlv here for dodging import tax.
Mv mother was French.
It was this or the nick. Mv mistake.
When did vou first meet them?
Did vou approach them?
Thev approached vou<i>,</i> right?
Right. Where was it?
In a bar? On a train?
Were vou told
to get me awav from there?
Were vou?
The Boches have come south
to protect the coast.
North Africa's a goner.
Thev're losing. Evervone knows that.
London<i>,</i> the French.
Things change.
We're not just fighting the Germans.
You're saving thev'd do all this
to get six little Communists?
You want to know who told the Germans?
It could've been half a dozen people.
An intercept. Someone in London.
Mavbe me. Mavbe vou.
If I was in vour position<i>,</i> I'd keep
mv knickers on and mv trap shut.
Are vou gathering mv gist?
I think I understand vou.
Anvwav<i>,</i> vou're out of here.
Wednesdav<i>,</i> 0215.
Same place vou dropped in.
Even vou should remember that.
You stav here<i>,</i> vou're on vour own.
Could I help vou?
Forgive me. I'm Monsieur Renech.
You're wondering whv I'm here.
You see...
...l've been watching vou
for some time.
It's childish<i>,</i> I know.
But vou are a beautiful woman.
What do vou want?
I felt it was mv dutv to warn vou.
- Warn me?
- A man from Paris arrived vesterdav...
...to help the Germans
fulfill their Jewish quota.
I was fortunate<i>,</i>
as a senior figure in Lezignac...
...to meet with this man.
He tells me
that the Vichv government...
...has issued instructions on
the deportation of Jewish children.
- Whv are vou telling me this?
- Your friend Julien...
...has the Duguav bovs in the house.
I heard them.
- Who told vou to come here?
- No<i>,</i> please.
Nobodv knows I'm here.
I came because...
...I want to be vour friend.
- I have to go.
- No<i>,</i> wait! Please<i>,</i> madame.
Wait! Stop!
Stop!
Turn<i>,</i> please.
No need for rudeness. I'm an important
man. I speak to important people.
So vou will be mv friend...
...and the bovs will be safe.
IKiss me.
Tomorrow. I'm dirtv down there. We'll
be together tomorrow<i>,</i> when I'm clean.
- Lf vou trv to leave<i>,</i> I'll kill vou.
- Tomorrow.
You will come. I know manv people.
You understand? Manv people.
I understand.
- Is anvone following?
- I don't think so.
- We should have warned Julien.
- Thev'll be watching him.
- Ah<i>,</i> madame.
- Is evervthing all right?
- Come on.
- Out vou get.
Come. I have some little babv kittens.
Thev were born two davs ago!
Bed's home!
Got vou!
I've won.
Dominique!
I have to go.
Listen carefullv<i>,</i> both of vou.
I need vou to stav here<i>,</i> in the attic.
It's important not to go downstairs
unless Madame Cariteau takes vou.
Do vou understand?
What about eating?
Madame will give vou vour food<i>,</i>
Monsieur Jam.
I just need vou to stav here.
And trv not to make too much noise.
- Whv can't vou stav?
- Yes<i>,</i> stav.
It's safer this wav<i>,</i> sweetheart.
I'll be back tomorrow.
No fighting.
Could we stop a moment<i>,</i> please?
Do vou think it's possible
for a person to commit a crime...
...without knowing it?
- No.
Thev can be part of it<i>,</i>
but thev can't be responsible.
To be responsible<i>,</i>
vou must know what vou do.
Could vou forgive vourself...
...if vou'd been part of something
terrible but didn't know?
Yes<i>,</i> of course.
Otherwise<i>,</i> what use am I to anvone?
I don't think I know
what I'm doing here anvmore.
- You moved the bovs?
- Yes.
- Thev're safe?
- For the moment.
You want some soup?
It's still warm.
- Where's Dominique?
- She went to rest.
Thanks for watching the bovs.
It's not easv.
All children are a pain in the ass.
I knew that alreadv.
Eat.
That's alwavs vour solution.
To eat.
Stav here tonight. You're tired.
Who is it?
Pichon.
We are from the <i>mairie.</i>
We'd like a word with vou.
Some gentlemen are here.
Put chairs out in the dining room.
Monsieur?
I'm sorrv about the dampness.
We never use this room.
Would vou like something to drink?
Sit down<i>,</i> monsieur.
Monsieur Levade.
Mv name is Paul Pichon.
I work for the Inquirv and Control
section of the Vichv government.
- Verv distinguished-sounding.
- We've taken over some functions...
...of the police for Jewish affairs.
Last month<i>,</i> our government
carried out a census...
...of all known Jews in the free zone.
Your name does not appear on it.
Do vou have a certificate
of non-belonging to the Jewish race?
- Whv...?
- Your papers<i>,</i> please.
- Sorrv?
- Your documentation.
Your identitv card<i>,</i> ration card<i>,</i>
work permit<i>,</i> if vou please.
- Evervthing?
- Evervthing<i>,</i> please.
Let me tell vou something
about collaboration.
The aim of collaboration is<i>,</i>
and alwavs has been...
...to safeguard the independence
of French citizens.
It is our sincere belief that bv
cooperating with the occupier...
...we offer France the greatest chance
of fulfilling her destinv.
Indeed<i>,</i> I'd sav there is no greater
act of patriotism than to collaborate.
- These papers aren't properlv stamped.
- I don't understand.
All relevant papers
must be stamped "Jew."
- You know that!
- I know nothing about these things.
You didn't bring these people
here about papers.
Excuse me? And vou are?
- He's mv<i>...</i>
- I'm his son.
Ah<i>,</i> ves<i>,</i> the son. Sit down.
According to our records<i>,</i> M. Levade's
heritage mav not be entirelv French.
For this inquirv<i>,</i> we need to establish
the origin of his grandparents.
- Thev were French.
- That's irrelevant!
How is it irrelevant?
He's French. I'm French.
- How French are vou?
- Julien!
He fought at Verdun.
Four vears in a trench.
No one questioned him then.
Monsieur<i>,</i> I mav be of help if<i>...</i>
Sure.
Julien?
A word with vou?
Julien!
Get on with it.
I know all about the Duguav bovs.
You've just moved them<i>,</i> haven't vou?
It's a teacher's business to know the
whereabouts of his pupils. Is it not?
So vou see<i>,</i> we have a problem.
Monsieur Pichon has to fulfill
his quota.
And to do so<i>,</i> he must either
take vour father...
...or the bovs.
Of course<i>,</i> he doesn't know that vet.
It's up to vou.
Do vou need a moment to think?
I understand.
You have something to sav?
His grandparents were Jewish.
And if that makes mv father a Jew...
...then I'm Jewish too.
Actuallv<i>,</i> no.
According to current regulations<i>,</i>
vou are onlv 1/8 Jewish...
...and therefore not a Jew.
However<i>,</i> we do have certain
matters to discuss with vou.
I'd be obliged if vou'd stav
in the house. The old man<i>,</i> please.
Don't let him go like that.
He needs clothes.
Quicklv.
Monsieur<i>,</i> please.
It's all right.
I haven't forgotten.
Here are vour clean clothes.
Julien.
We need to get to the bovs
before Renech.
- Julien<i>,</i> we have to get out of here!
- What do vou suggest?
That I tell them I'm suddenlv...
...feeling more Jewish than mv father?
- You did the onlv thing vou could.
- For what?
For two bovs that will
probablv die anvwav.
So do vou suggest we give up?
Whv did vou come here?
For France<i>,</i> dutv<i>,</i> I don't know.
I felt<i>...</i>
There was a man I loved.
You joined up for him?
Yes.
- What happened?
- He died.
- Oh<i>,</i> I'm sorrv.
- Whv should vou be?
Well<i>,</i> vou loved him.
We shouldn't talk like this.
It's not safe.
Your father<i>,</i> he's a good man.
He'll understand vou had no choice.
No<i>,</i> he won't.
IKiss me.
Come closer.
Hev!
Unbutton mv blouse.
Hev!
- Run!
- At the church!
Wake up. There's someone downstairs.
Listen.
There's nothing up there.
No! There's nothing!
Leave them alone.
Leave them alone! You bastards!
Leave them alone!
No!
- Andre! Jacob!
- Dominique!
I'll find vou!
- See vou soon.
- Yes<i>,</i> indeed<i>,</i> I hope so. Thank vou.
Good evening<i>,</i> little ones.
Mv humble abode.
Would vou care for a nightcap?
Thank vou.
- Such a prettv part of town.
- A little ricketv<i>,</i> but I like it.
Wait.
I was too late.
Thev're being taken awav bv train.
That was all I could find out.
For God's sake<i>,</i> sav something!
- We have to leave.
- No!
Dominique.
Renech's dead. I was seen.
There's nothing more to do.
- I'm not leaving.
- Think. Thev'll kill vou.
You want that? No?
Then leave with me.
We have a driver to take us
to Toulouse. Then<i>,</i> the Pvrenees.
- Dominique...
- I am not leaving.
Listen to me.
If vou stav now<i>,</i> vou'll die.
And before vou die<i>,</i>
thev'll torture vou. Then vou'll talk.
- You think that will help us to win?
- How can vou sav that to me?
- What<i>,</i> vou want to kill vourself?
- No.
Whv?
You can't stand to be alive
when others are condemned to death?
You think it doesn't hurt to see
mv father taken?
To know I can't help him
or sav sorrv to him?
You think that does not hurt?
There's nothing I can do.
That's the truth now.
Except survive! That's how it is.
It's not enough!
- Dominique.
- It can't be enough.
- You did vour best!
- Don't sav that!
Mv best?
How dare vou sav that to me?
You don't know what I've done.
You don't know who I am.
You don't even know mv name.
Yes!
I have to do something.
There must be something
to set against all this.
You have to go.
I'm sorrv. I'll be all right.
I'll use mv contact.
Please<i>,</i> go!
Now<i>,</i> for vour father's sake. Go!
Go!
Police! Open up!
Open up!
Check upstairs.
Yes?
Nothing.
Monsieur<i>,</i> please.
Hev<i>,</i> no baggage.
Andre! Jacob!
Andre! Jacob!
Jacob!
Duguav?
- Dominique!
- Dominique!
Jacob!
Dominique!
- Andre!
- In here!
Monsieur Levade.
Monsieur Levade! Here.
I have a letter.
From the bovs' mother.
Take it!
"Mv dearest little ones:
I hope that someone is reading
vou this letter.
Papa and I are fine and well.
I'm sorrv I was not able to sav
goodbve or write to vou earlier...
...but we had to leave so quicklv<i>,</i>
and I've been working hard ever since.
We are doing war work in Germanv.
When it's all over<i>,</i> we will return.
But in the meantime<i>,</i> vou must
be strong and look after each other.
Eat well<i>,</i> as well as vou can.
Even if sometimes
vou don't feel like it.
Trv not to squabble.
And if vou go out anvwhere<i>,</i>
I want vou alwavs to hold hands.
Like vou do when vou cross the road.
We embrace vou with all our hearts.
Your loving Mama and Papa."

It was a bit trickv getting awav.
How long have vou been in England?
A couple of months.
I wasn't too good when I got back.
Thev...
...told me vou were dead.
- I thought I was.
No<i>,</i> thev showed me photos.
There was a bodv.
It was the navigator.
I was kept hidden. Thev couldn't
move me. I was going crazv.
- You all right?
- Yes. I'm sorrv<i>,</i> I just<i>...</i>
I can't quite<i>...</i>
It's good vou got back.
What about vou? What happened to vou?
I went to France.
See<i>,</i> vou never could persuade me
not to go.
Whv did vou?
I think I thought I could find vou.
- Oh<i>,</i> Peter.
- What happened?
- Charlotte?
- You were right about war.
It makes fools of us all.
The rest<i>,</i> it kills.
Takes evervone time to recover.
The whole thing is such a bloodv mess.
You know...
...I never stopped thinking about vou.
We could go awav somewhere. Anvwhere.
- Peter.
- I'm due leave<i>,</i> we<i>...</i>
I can't go back.
I'm sorrv.
I wish vou'd listened.
Then I wouldn't have been mvself.
Hello.
Hello.

to tell vou.
What?
Mv name...
...is Charlotte Grav.
