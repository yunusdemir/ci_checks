Please stop!
Please!
You almost wrecked my car.
Well?
Get in.
And now fellas...
we'll hear mat fine new platter

The thumb isn't good enough for you.
You've gotta use your whole body.
But would you have stopped
if I had used my thumb?
No.
What's this all about?
I'll make a quick guess.
You were out with some guy
who thought "No" was a three-letter word.
I should've thrown you off that cliff
back there. I might still do it.
- Where you headed?
- Los Angeles.
Drop me off at the first bus stop.
Do you always go around
with no clothes on?
♪ I try to sing-- ♪
What's the trouble, Officer?
A woman escaped from an asylum upstate.
Young and wearing a trench coat.
Seen anybody up the road
that fit that description?
- No, I haven't, Officer.
- Okay, move on.
Haven't seen a thing, Officer.
- Oh, my wife's been asleep.
- All right. Move on.
May I have my hand back now?
So you're a fugitive
from the laughing house.
They forced me to go there.
Took away my clothes to make me stay.
Who?
I wish I could tell you that.
I have to tell someone.
When people are in trouble,
they need to talk.
But you know the old saying.
What I don't know can't hurt me?
This wheel doesn't feel right.
It keeps pulling over.
- Good evening, folks.
- Check the right front wheel.
Yes, sir.
What'd you find?
Caught in the spindle.
It was binding against the drum.
Oh, we must've picked it up
when we went off the road back there.
Yeah? The only thing I ever pick up
when I go off the road is poison ivy.
- Thanks, kid.
- Thank you.
- Would you do me a favor, please?
- Wouldn't mind at all.
Would you put a stamp on this
and drop it in the mailbox for me, please?
Yes, ma'am.
Anything else, ma'am?
Did you find out
what was wrong with the wheel?
Oh, yeah.
You picked up a piece of branch...
when you took that little, uh,
trip off the side of the road.
So long. Come back again.
You're angry with me, aren't you?
Sony I nearly wrecked
your pretty little car.
I was just thinking how much you can tell
about a person from such simple things.
- Your car, for instance.
- What kind of a message does it send you?
You have only one real, lasting love.
Now who could that be?
You.
You're one of those self-indulgent males
who thinks about nothing but his clothes...
his car, himself.
Bet you do push-ups every morning
just to keep your belly hard.
You against good health or something?
I could tolerate flabby muscles in a man
if it would make him more friendly.
You're the kind of a person
who never gives in a relationship...
who only takes.
Ah, woman.
The incomplete sex.
And what does she need to complete her?
Why, man, of course. Wonderful man.
All right, all right. Let it go.
That bus stop will be coming up pretty soon,
and I don't even know your name.
You forget.
I'm a loony from the laughing house.
All loonies are dangerous.
Do you ever read poetry?
No, of course you wouldn't.
Christina Rossetti wrote love sonnets.
I was named after her.
- Christina?
- Yes, Mike.
I got your name from
the registration certificate, Mr. Hammer.
Get me to that bus stop,
and you can forget you ever saw me.
- If we don't make that bus stop--
- We will.
If we don't...
...remember me.
No! No!
- She passed out.
- I'll bring her to.
If you revive her,
do you know what that will be?
Resurrection. That's what it would be.
And do you know what "resurrection" means?
It means "raise the dead."
And just who do you think you are
that you think you can raise the dead?
- Put him in the car too?
- Naturally.
Mike.
Mike.
Hey, Mike.
Mike.
- Hi, Velda.
- Hi.
Dr. Luciano, call the operator, please.
You're never around when I need ya.
You never need me when I'm around.
- Pat's here.
- Five minutes. That's all you've got.
Nurse.
- Hi, flatfoot.
- Hi.
Three days ago, I was figuring I'd have
to finance a new tux to bury the corpse.
Three days?
How am I doin'?
You're doin' all right.
In a couple of weeks,
you'll walk out of here.
Can you remember, Mike?
How it happened, the whole thing.
I never thought I'd smell that again.
Ooh. Look at all the goodies.
- I have a cab.
- Mr. Hammer?
You won't need the cab.
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
That figures. See ya later.
- Why don't you come in? It may be a while.
- I'll wait here.
We're not getting very far,
are we, Mr. Hammer?
Well, now, we have most of the facts.
All we need is a little more fill-in.
I almost get myself killed,
all he wants is a little more fill-in.
Is it too much to ask for your cooperation?
- And make 'em try it again?
- You'll be given full protection.
Maybe we'll have better luck
with some more elementary questions.
Your full name, please, Mr. Hammer.
"Michael Hammer. 10401 Wilshire
Boulevard, Los Angeles, California."
Now just what do you do for a living?
According to our information,
he calls himself a private investigator.
- His speciality is divorce cases.
- He's a bedroom dick.
He gets information against the wife.
Then he makes a deal with the wife
to get evidence against the husband.
Thus playing both ends against the middle.
Just how do you achieve all this?
You crawl under beds?
Nothing so primitive.
He has a secretary.
At least that's what he calls her.
What's her name, Mr. Hammer?
- Velda Wichman.
- She's a very attractive young woman.
Real woo-bait. Lives like a princess.
He sics her onto the husbands,
and before you know it...
he's got his evidence
and he's ready for the big squeeze.
Who do you sic onto the wives,
Mr. Hammer?
That's his department.
All right. You've got me convinced.
I'm a real stinker.
Now if that's all you've got on your minds,
I'd like to get along home.
Yes, I know. You're anxious
to get back to your life's work.
You're free to go.
Open a window.
- Thanks for waiting, Pat.
- Yeah.
She was a cute kid.
Had the nicest way of needling a guy.
There'll be a long pause before
those characters get a line on who killed her.
The law isn't fast enough.
You could do it a lot better. Is that it?
Now look, Mike.
Who do you think you are?
What's the pitch, Pat?
An ordinary little girl gets killed,
and it rings bells all the way to Washington.
There's gotta be a pitch.
I'll give you a bit of advice.
Too many people like you have contempt
for anything that has to do with the law.
You'd like to take it into your own hands.
But when you do that,
you might as well be living in a jungle.
I picked up a girl.
If she hadn't gotten in my way,
I wouldn't have stopped.
She must be connected
with something big.
Mike, why don't you tell us
what you know...
then step aside like a nice fella
and let us do our job?
What's in it for me?
Mikey!
Mikey!
Hey, Sammy. Look. My friend
just returned from the grave.
Hey, Mike!
Va-va-voom!
I'm sure glad you're back, Mike.
Like Lazarus, rose out from the grave.
Now tell me, what happened?
What did you do, huh?
Did you drive too fast in that new rod?
Where is it?
Velda says you were gonna pick it up.
Ah, there's nothing to pick up, Mike.
You ought to have seen that beautiful,
pretty little rod of yours.
All torn up. Scrap. Junk.
Never gonna go va-va-voom no more.
Break my heart.
- Anyway, you're all right now, huh?
- A little shaky.
A little shaky, huh?
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna pick up
a couple of cute little Greek girls.
What I mean-- va-va-voom!
3-D pow!
Oh. Forgot to tell you. There was some guys
looking for you, asking a lot of questions.
- What kind of guys?
- Oh, tough guys.
Very tough guys, Mike.
Ah, forget it. Look.
I'm glad you're back.
You look swell. And listen.
And I'll see you tomorrow, huh?
And take care of yourself, will ya? Huh?
Are you all right, Mike?
I don't know yet. Maybe not.
Oh.
Hey, Sammy!
What does he mean, "maybe not"?
Ah, who knows what he means?
This is Crestview 5-4124.
Mr. Hammer, whom you are calling
is not available at present.
If you wish to leave a record of your call...
please state your message
at the sound of the tone.
Hello, Mike? Just checking to see
if you got home. Please call me when you--
Velda.
On, I'm glad you're there.
Are you all right?
- Sure. why?
- I'll be right over.
What did they want?
Asked a lot of questions.
- What kind of questions?
- Questions.
When you leave, tell Nick--
What do you want me to tell him?
You know, just to hold
the soft part of your arms is a meal.
Tell him to drop his car off tonight
and pick it up in the morning.
What's in the folder?
Oh, a fella named Ray Diker called up
while you were in the hospital.
He wants to see you, and...
I thought you'd want me
to check up on him.

Don't answer it.
Mike?
Pat. Official business this time.
Maybe he'll go away.
Go ahead. Don't mind me.
I'm revoking your
private investigator's license.
Also your gun permit.
If I catch you snooping around with a gun
in your hand, I'll throw you in jail.
I don't think you'd like it in jail.
Who's Ray Diker?
What do you do with this guy?
He was a reporter on The News, wasn't he?
Used to write a science column.
Why did he drop out?
I hear your friends
were over to question him too.
I've gotta say it. He's got a nose.
He can sniff out information
like nobody I ever saw.
What else did you hear?
Couldn't find him. He dropped out of sight.
Science editor of a newspaper
drops out of sight and nobody knows why.
If you know anything,
you'd better tell me, Mike.
If I knew anything, I would.
Sure you would.
You ought to tell him, Mike.
- Did Diker leave an address?
- Oh, somewhere over on Flower Street.
But if I were you, I wouldn't go.
That tape I made of you
and lover boy got lost.
There goes your case.
Call him up and set up another session.
Tell him you're sorry.
You want to make up
for all the pain you gave him.
Give him some of that sincerity.
Oh, what'd you find out about the girl?
Christina Georgina Rossetti.
Poetess, English. Born 1830, died 1894.
Your Christina was being held
in that hospital for interrogation.
Who by: the feds or state?
That they wouldn't tell me.
What's the point of all this,
if it's any of my business?
She told me if I dropped her off
at the bus station, I could forget her.
But if she didn't make it,
she said, "Remember me."
So remember her.
She's dead.
But I'm not dead.
Hey. Remember me?
Yeah.
I remember you from somewhere.
Weren't you supposed
to call that fellow, Mr., uh...
- What's his name?
- Friendly?
That's my name for him.
Mr. Friendly.
He certainly was friendly.
Maybe he'll give you some of that
nice dialogue again, that honey talk.
That tape sure was nice.
Do me a favor, will you?
Keep away from the windows.
Somebody might blow you a kiss.
- 121?
- South.
- Popcorn?
- Yeah. How much?
Dime, like always.
Thank you.
Drop the knife! Drop the knife!
Drop the knife.
Yeah? What do you want?
Beat me. Force your way in.
- I want in!
- What's the big idea? Who do you think you are?
Make it sound good.
- Make it sound good.
- What's on your mind?
You were with her the night she died.
She knew she was gonna get killed.
- She must have talked to ya, told ya.
- Told me what?
If you knew, you'd be afraid,
like she was afraid.
Like I am.
You'd better go.
She told me her name was Christina.
Christina what?
Bailey. Christina Bailey.
Her address, the last place she lived?
325, Bunker Hill.
If you change your mind and
wanna talk, get in touch with my secretary.
She'll call me.
Oh, you're the one.
Every time when I pick up the trunk,
I take a deep breath.
Make you stronger, deep breaths.
This time I think, "Oh, you breathe
good deep. Trunk feels very light.
By golly, old man,
you are becoming very strong," I think.
But you are the one, huh?
Moving somebody in?
Move in, move out.
Always people come and go.
One place they never leave.
You know, 63 years I live in one place--
the house of my body.
Move in when I born, move out when I die.
You bet. Yes, sir.
- Can I help you?
- Oh, no, grazie. I mean, thank you very much.
If you help, then afterwards,
all the things gets heavier.
I go and get the other one.
- What do you want?
- I want to see the super.
What can I do for you?
There's a card on the mailbox there.
Christina Bailey.
The police have already
been through her apartment.
He told ya. The police have already
been through her apartment.
I wanna go through her apartment.
- Ask him who he is, Horace.
- Tell her to shut up.
Shut up.
- Can I help ya?
- I don't be fooled so easy this time.
Is the young fellow, my deep breath.
Always willing to help an old man
moving people around.
Because people-- oh, they always move.
They never stand still.
Move from here, from there,
and move-- and move all the time.
Her lease still has a month to go,
but the police said I could rent it.
Whose stuff is this?
Well, we rent it furnished,
but she fixed it up to suit herself.
- No bird?
- Her roommate let it die.
- What's her name?
- Carver. Lily Carver.
She moved out a couple of days ago.
All of a sudden,
in the middle of the night.
Didn't say where.

She always had it tuned to that station.

Okay.
Hey, mister.
Look, mister.
You make a deep breath for me.
I'm a-gonna tell you a little secret.
The other girt, the roommate
of Miss Christina-- she tells me not to say.
Afraid, she is.
Like somebody is afraid to die.
I moved her.
I tell you where.
Buonanotte.

Come in.
Who are you?
My name is Mike Hammer, if it matters.
What do you want?
I was with Christina
the night she was killed.
They tried to kill me too.
If you like, I'll show you the scars.
- How'd you find me?
- Picked up a thread. Anybody could do it.
Mind if I sit down
while you're making up your mind?
Christina was my friend.
The bird in the cage--
what happened to it?
It was a nice bird.
Used to eat out of my hand.
You let it die. Why'd you let it die?
It reminded me of her every time it sang.
She was a good kid.
She was lots of fun.
We worked together, couple of jobs.
Till she got sick.
That's when I noticed
that she started to change.
You get on a merry-go-round
and think you can get off any old time.
But then it starts going too fast.
She was scared.
She was more and more scared.
She was afraid to go out.
She'd go to the movies once in a while...
or out for groceries, but never very far.
Then the police came around.
They asked questions-- lots of questions.
Then they took her away.
After a while, I had a feeling
someone was watching the place.
Then those men came.
What did they want?
I didn't stick around to find out.
Why was Christina so afraid?
It's all right. You can trust me.
I don't know.
You wanna get even for what happened
to Christina, don't you?
I'll see what I can do.

This is Crestview 5-4124.
Mr. Hammer, whom you are calling
is not available at present.
If you wish to leave
a record of your call...
please state your message
at the sound of the tone.
Good evening Mr. Hammer.
You probably will wonder who this is
but it does not matter.
What does mailer is that your work
has been interrupted, your car wrecked.
Your life has been ruffled--
to put it mildly
If you had not stopped
to pick up Christina,
not any of these things
would have happened.
So let's pretend you did not pick her up.
- So what happens if I pretend?
- Ah, so there you are, Mr. Hammer
Why nothing will happen.
Your life will go on as serenely as before.
As a token of our intentions, look in front
of your apartment tomorrow morning.
That Mike.
He wrecks one car and goes out
and buys another one, just like that.
Wow.
Va-va-voom!
Oh, someday I'm gonna get me
a car just like this.
I'm gonna get in, and I'm gonna drive.
Oh, shines like a million.
Hey, even the keys are in.
Well, think I'll go around the block
and come back before he wakes up.
Why not? Pow!
- Nick!
- Huh?
- Don't touch anything.
- I didn't touch it. I didn't touch anything.
Turn that key,
it's the last thing you'd ever do.
- Open the hood.
- The hood?
Yeah. Look under it.
- No, no. The other side.
- The other side.
Down around the starter.
Yeah.
Disconnect it and take it out.
- Is this what you mean?
- Yeah. A torpedo.
You turn the key, and, boom--
no more Nick.
Wow.
- The hood.
- Oh, the hood.
Wow, that was close.
Boy. Oh, boy.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- Are you really sure?
- Yeah, I said I'm sure.
He's sure.
Boh-boh-boh-boh.
My mustache. My father's mustache.
Let's go to the freeway.
I wanna see how this little bird flies.
- We'd better stop off at the garage first.
- Why?
- That's the one they expected us to find.
- You mean there's another one?
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.
He's sure.
Find anything?
That's it. The sweet little kiss-off.
It's a bomb connected to the speedometer.
Car goes slow, nothing happens...
but out in the country,
where you open her up wide--
Va-va-voom?
- Hey, Nick.
- What?
How'd you like to have a little rod,
just like this one?
- Mine? All mine?
- Down to the last cotter pin.
What do I have to do?
Name it and it's done.
- Can you find out who souped her up?
- A cinch.
I know of a place in Culver City.
I'll dig around and ask a few questions.
- Va-va-voom?
- Va-va-voom.
Nicky, you should ask
what it's worth to him.
What he's gonna get out of it.
Don't bother me, small fry.
You play your guitar, Sammy boy,
and I'll drive my car.
Voom, voom, pow!
Gee, Nicky, you're gonna get yourself
in a lot of trouble.
Ah!



- Did you call your friendly Mr. Friendly?
- Yes. He awaits me anxiously.
Then call him back and cancel it.
We're gonna steer away from these
penny-ante divorce cases for a while.
I got a line on something better.
That girl I picked up
was mixed up with something big.
And a cut of something big...
could be something big.
I want you to find out
all you can about her.
First you find a little thread...
little thread leads you to a string...
and the string leads you to a rope...
and from the rope you hang by the neck.
What kind of a girl was she,
this friend of yours-- Christina?
I only ask because Ray Diker phoned up.
He left two names.
He said you might check up on them.
Where are they?
In my typewriter.

Va-Va-Voom says that in Greek
your name would be Mixalis Sires.
But under any other name,
would you be as sweet?
Kawolsky.
Kawolsky.
He was a professional fighter.
His first name was Lee.
Couldn't get anything on Raymondo.
Don't know what he was.
Why do you keep saying "was"?
They both knew your Christina.
They both died the same way she did.
How was that?
The way you almost died.
Traffic... accident?
One fell out of a cab,
and the other was run over by a truck.
Who's Carmen Trivago?
Carmen Trivago, a poor man's Caruso.
An unemployed opera singer
in search of an opera.
Raymondo's friend.
And who's Harvey Wallace?
He drove the truck that ran over Kawolsky.
I was going down Washington Boulevard.
You know,
where they're building that freeway.
It was kinda late.
I had a long day.
Winter. You know how it gets dark early.
I had my lights on.
I had 'em on. I know that.
Streets are jammed down there
around quittin' time.
This was after 7:00.
The street's empty.
I was goin' under a bridge...
and goin' you know?
This guy come out of nowhere.
Did he step out or run out?
- Or maybe he was pushed.
- Yeah. Pushed. More like he was pushed.
- Hello, Mike.
- Hi, Eddie.
How do you like my new boy?
Kid Nino.
Isn't he pretty?
Doesn't he move pretty?
Sure, just like all your fighters, Eddie.
All right, Kid. Shadowbox around.
I'm showing you off to a friend.
Isn't he beautiful? Isn't he lovely?
Look at the way he moves.
Sure. He's great, Eddie.
But the night he fights his big fight, he won't
be able to punch his way out of a paper bag.
- Why not, Mike?
- You'll sell him out, like you sold out all the others.
Not this one, Mike.
Wait until the odds build up,
until you can't resist.
No, Mike.
- When does he go?
- Tomorrow night. Main bout.
He's a winner, so it'll be short money.
Bet all you can. Bet your shirt.
It would pay more if he lost.
You sure he isn't gonna lay down and die?
On my word, Mike.
Now that's the kind of a bet I like.
Thanks a lot.
Oh. What I really came over for
was to find out what you know...
about a kid that used to fight
under the name of Lee Kawolsky.
- What about him?
- Come on. Don't give me that.
You've been around.
You know just about everybody.
About him I don't know.
He was killed in an accident,
but it wasn't really an accident.
Two fellas. They came in here.
Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse.
They asked me,
if anybody come around...
asking questions about Lee Kawolsky,
what do I know?
I looked at their faces.
You know what I said?
I said, "I don't know anything."
They said to keep that in mind,
and they'd make it worth my while.
You'd sell the gold
out of your mother's teeth.
Okay. How much did they give you?
I'll top it.
You can't top this.
They said they'd let me breathe.
Hello. Pat Murphy, please.
Tell him Mike Hammer's calling.
Hello, Pat. What do you know
about a couple of nice fellas...
named Charlie Max and Sugar Smallhouse?
Oh, never mind what I know. All you have
to tell me is whose whistle they jump to.
Carl Evello?
Yeah. Yeah.
Go ahead. I can hear ya. Yeah.
I don't know. Just a minute. I'll ask Mr. Evello.
- What do you wanna do, Carl?
- Tell him we'll take half his action.
Carl says we'll take half. How they doing
in the fifth at Warwick? They come out yet?
- We can get down a bet, huh?
- Would you give me a light, Sugar?
- Don't bother me, cheesecake.
- Aw, come on, Sugar.
Give us a thousand on Big Boy
in the fifth-- on the nose.
Aren't you gonna light
my cigarette for me, Sugar?
Blow! You dames are worse than flies.
Are you gonna play cards, Charlie,
or ain't ya?
The field is on the stretch now...
And about to make the swing back
to the starting gate.
Hello.
This is a coincidence.
- How do you do, ma'am?
- How do I do?
Crazy.
Don't be afraid. I won't bite.
You don't taste like anybody I know.
But it's all right.
In fact, it's wonderful.
Come on, crazy.
Right now, Big Boy is 5-to-2 favorite.
His record this year is outstanding.
- Seconds?
- Okay.
You sure we haven't met before?
Never.
Who are you?
Who am I? Who are you?
I'm Friday. I'd have been named Tuesday
if I'd been born on Tuesday.
I'm Carl's sister. Half sister.
Same mother, different father.
You know, you're not like the others.
Carl's friends, I mean.
Well, maybe that's because
I'm not his friend.
Oh, wonderful.
Then you can be my friend.
All mine, nothing to do with Carl.
And there they go!
They come away from the gate--
They're big and hairy and ugly.
They chew long, black cigars
and they talk loud.
I don't like them.
But I like you.
If you like me, why don't you
invite me into the house?
- Will you come into my house?
- Why not?
What's that horse doin', walkin' or somethin'?
He ain't even in on the call.
Gin.
Gin?
He don't pay no attention to the cards,
and he kills me with his gin!
Here's to... friendship.
To friendship.
- I have lots of friends.
- I'll bet you have.
I'm not hard to get a long with.
Really, I'm not.
I can be a very... good friend.
- Will you be my friend?
- What do I have to do?
If you wanna be a close friend...
ask me something.
And no matter what it is,
the answer is yes, huh?
Maybe.
Let's see how good you are at spelling.
Can you spell the word "No"?
N-O... spells "No."
That's a good girl.
Now you practice saying that...
because one of the best ways
to be friendly is to know when to say no.
Say, your brother wouldn't be wearing
blue suede shoes, by any chance, would he?
Hardly. He's more the black moccasin type.
You know, it's a hot day,
and I'm beginning to feel kind of warm.
Why don't you invite me
for a dip in the pool?
Sure. Just get all wet.
Get This was the higher price
in the morning line.
Experts placed Roaring River--
Hey. Look who's here.
You'll find a suit inside. I'll wait.
...odds are higher than the morning line
are doing joyous dances of victory.
And rightly they should.
Little Georgie Lowry,
the lad from the delta land of Colorado--
- Are you kidding?
- Why not?
Charlie, Sug.
A good effort on this deep Warwick track.
Send him into the house.
How do I know what he knows?
All I know-- that he's here
and he's snooping around.
All right, I'll be polite.
- Mr. Evello?
- In here.
I'll call you back.
Hello, Mr. Hammer.
You handle yourself pretty well.
I figure it's a good thing
to speak a lot of languages.
Any country you go to,
you can take care of yourself.
Yeah. Well, maybe you can
speak my language, huh?
Like putting torpedoes in gifts?
I'll admit that was a little crude.
We keep underestimating you.
Frankly, I don't know what's on your mind.
What do you want, Mr. Hammer?
Yesterday I was looking for a thread.
Today I'm looking for a piece of string.
And tomorrow-- who knows?
Huh, Mr. Hammer?
You don't even know
what you're looking for.
- Tell me.
- Trouble.
That's what you're looking for,
Mr. Hammer-- trouble.
You know how lucky you are?
If that drop off the cliff didn't kill you,
the torpedo should have.
Or Sugar.
What'd you do to him anyway?
You scared Charlie half to death.
Look, Mike, I like you.
I like the way you handle yourself.
You seem like a reasonable man.
Why don't we make a deal?
What's it worth to you to turn
your considerable talents...
back to the gutter you crawled out of?
Name a price.
And you'll try it on for size, huh?
Oh, you're cute.
You oughta know better than anyone
what it's worth.
I set my fee according to the case.
And the longer I look at this one,
the higher it gets.
Oh, it does, huh?
Maybe you'd like to make an exploratory
offer just to get the ball rolling.
Okay, Mr. Hammer.
It's been nice talking to you, Mr. Hammer.
Drop around again sometime.
When I do, maybe I'll have
a better notion of what my fee is.
It's too late to set a fee, Mr. Hammer.
Suddenly it's too late.

I been out here three times already,
and this dame keeps brushing me off.
I gotta make a livin' too.
Aw, send somebody else.
How much can a guy take?
Look, I tell ya, I'm not comin' out again.
You can get somebody else.
There's other guys around here.

Guy could get a heart attack
walking up here.
Who invited ya?
Carmen Trivago-- what room?
Follow your ear.
Thank you.




Oh! He love her.
She's dead. He sings.
Il maestro. Magnifico!
Che bella voce. Bello. Bello.
Hey. Bravo. Bravissimo.
Who are you?
I hear you're a friend
of Nicholas Raymondo.
- Raymondo?
- Yeah.
That's right. Raymondo.
I know nothing. Nothing.
That's quite a stack of records
you got here.
Oh, yes.
Hey. Caruso's Pagliacci!
Caruso. Pagliacci. Il maestro.
- That's a collector's item.
- A collector's item. Yeah.
Please, what you want-a to know?
I-- I will tell you. I will tell you.
Raymondo is my friend, you know?
Very sad friend. Always he's-a sad.
He's, uh, how you call? Engineer scientist.
Very smart. Very bright.
Very sad.
He was murdered. Why was he murdered?
I don't know. I don't know.
What was he so sad about?
Well, for the way the-- the world is.
You see, very sad.
He says to me-- Oh--
"I'm-a very intelligent, Trivago,
but I'm-a very stupid.
I'm-a very rich. I'm-a very poor.
I have a little secret,
and it's very important.
And it's not important at all."
- Hmm.
- What did he mean by that?
Well, when I ask him,
he says that it's a-- a riddle.
Without an answer.
I think he's making the joke.
But, uh, when he's-a dead,
I know it's not-a the joke.
Somewhere-- Somewhere he has a secret.
How do you know that?
Well, they come, the ones that kill him.
The want something-- something small.
Something he can hide
where they don't find.
And they ask, "Where is it?"
I tell, "I don't know."
I don't know.

It's a lovely record.

Mike?
They came last night right after you left.
I heard them. I hid in the basement.
- They think you know something.
- But I don't.
Tell them that.
Look, I've gotta get out of here.
If they found you once,
they'll find you again.
I'm going down to my car.
When you hear the horn, come running.

Mikey!
- Hi, Mikey!
- What happened?
I went to Culver City like I told you.
They didn't know nothing.
But they were very interested.
They wanted to know why I ask.
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing.
- Uh, look, Nick.
- Huh?
I've gotta drop something off,
but I'll be back.
- We'll go together.
- Right.



Oh, hiya. Anything I can do
for you, mister?
Oh, I'm busy right now.
Hey, what are you doin' there?
Anything you can use you'll find in
the closet until we can get you some clothes.
- Uh, you can have the bedroom.
- Where will you sleep?
Oh, I'll take the couch.
If you want any coffee,
the kitchen's in the--
Thank you, Mike.
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay. You've made your point.
You're welcome.
Mike?
Mike.
Why did you come back tonight?
In your absence, there have been no calls.
You changed your mind.
Something changed it for you.
What was it?
You say you don't know a thing.
That's true. I don't.
But they think you do,
or they wouldn't be after you.
Maybe that's worth something.
Keep the door chained
and don't answer the phone.
They'll think I've hidden you away
somewhere safe.
They won't know you're here.
But if they pay you off, you'll tell them.
Then where will I be?
Mike! You can't do that!
Mike?
Mike!
Nico.
Oh, Nick.
They kill Nick, Mike.
Somebody, they kill Nick.
No!
Velda?
Velda.
Hello, Mike.
What is it?
What kind of trouble
are you in this time?
Yes. Yes, you are. I- I can see it.
I'm glad.
I'm always glad when you're in trouble,
because then you always come to me.
What is it, Mike?
Nick's dead.
Nick?
Jack slipped and car came down on him.
Is that what really happened?
He's done a couple of jobs for me.
And he got it.
Mike, all your friends
are gonna get it one of these days.
What is it you're after, Mike?
Something Nicholas Raymondo had
and the girl knew about.
Something very valuable.
Is it worth Nick's life or...
...or Christina's or Raymondo's?
Or Kawolsky's or-- or mine?
Or Lily Carver's?
Christina's roommate--
she's up in my apartment.
They tried to get her last night.
"They." A wonderful word.
And who are "they"?
They are the nameless ones
who kill people for the great whatsit.
Does it exist? Who cares?
Everyone everywhere is so involved
in a search for what?
Why don't you turn her over to Pat?
It's his job to protect her
if she needs protection.
Or to question her if that's what's needed.
Why are you always trying
to make a noise like a cop?
What were you doing in bed so early?
Oh, I had a few drinks.
I'm trying to sleep off a hangover.
I met your friend Ray Diker
over at Toscio's this afternoon.
He pointed out some joker at the bar,
a dealer in abstract art or something.
I went over and just happened
to pick him up.
Make your ears stand up?
He dropped a few names.
Want to hear them?
Carl Evello you know, but--
Dr. Soberin. Does that do anything for you?
This joker says there's a new art in the world,
and this doctor's starting a collection.
- What kind of a collection?
- I don't know.
He... tried to date me.
With a few drinks,
and one thing leading to another,
I suppose I could get some more
information about the doctor.
Do you want me to date him?
Well?
- Well, what?
- Well, what do you think?
I think I'd like to get my hands
on whoever killed Nick.
You want to avenge the death
of your dear friend.
How touching. How sweet.
How nicely it justifies your quest
for the great whatsit.
Why don't you leave, Mike.
Before I change my mind.
Besides, I'm--
I'm gonna need all the rest I can get...
if I'm gonna have any strength
to fight off my newfound...
my bosom friend.
Mike?
Meet me at the Pigalle.

Mike, come on.
A fella just come in,
said they got your girl.
They got Velda.
Told me to tell ya.
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
He cut out. He blew.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Thanks, Kitty.
Ah. Jaguar not good enough for you, huh?
Yeah. The ashtrays were all full.
That girl I was with the other night,
she gave you a letter to mail.
Do you happen to know
who it was addressed to?
Yeah.
Well, I just wanted to know
who the lucky guy was.
It was addressed to some joker named Mike.
Mike?
Interesting letter, huh?
Good evening, Mr. Hammer.
We took a gander at it.
Couldn't quite make it out.
Won't be no trouble this time, Mr. Hammer.
I've been takin' lessons.
I was out for two hours
after you flipped me.
Couldn't move a muscle.
- Give him a hand, Charlie.
- Yeah, sure.
Here. Lean on me if you like, huh?
Feel okay?
Well, here we are, Mr. Hammer.
Watch your step.
For a couple of cannons,
you guys sure are polite.
We're here on this earth such a brief span,
we might as well be.
Well, you are awake.
Lie still. Why torment yourself?
Who would you see?
Someone you do not know. A stranger.
What is it we are seeking?
Diamonds?
Rubies? Gold?
Perhaps narcotics.
How civilized this earth used to be.
But as the world becomes more primitive,
its treasures become more fabulous.
Perhaps sentiment will succeed
where greed failed.
You will die, Mr. Hammer.
But your friend-- you can save her.
Yes, you can.
The young lady you picked up
on the highway--
she wrote you a letter.
In it were two words-- "Remember me."
She asks you to remember.
What is it you must remember?
Do not be alarmed, Mr. Hammer.
It is only a harmless drug.
Sodium Pentothal-- the truth serum.
Under its influence, you will sleep.
And while you sleep...
...your subconscious will provide the answer.
And you will cry out what it is
that you must remember.
Pleasant dreams, Mr. Hammer.
"Remember me."
What did she mean?
"Remember me."
What did she mean?
Any luck?
Down he goes again. One, two, three.
He takes the automatic eight count now.
Six, seven, eight.
And Bender is up once more.
The referee is wiping his gloves off
holding McCoy away as he does so.
Now here comes McCoy once again.
McCoy senses this may be the end.
It's a left hook to the jaw, and Bender
is trying frantically to cover up.
That was his second knockdown
in this round and the third in the fight.
We're any halfway through the ninth.
Bender has been talking a bad beating.
Now he's succeeded in lying McCoy up
for the moment in a clinch.
- Hey!
- McCoy pushes him off.
- Hey!
- ... a left jab to the nose, spilling more blood.
Bender is trying frantically
to get on his bicycle,
but McCoy is in full chase.
He has Bender up against the ropes now.
Back among the living, huh?
- I got it figured.
- Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, let's have it.
- Will you let her go?
- Sure.
Take my word-- free as a bird.
You wanna talk?
I wanna whisper.
So whisper.
...torture of leather. And there's a left!
Sug. Sugar.
Yes, Mr. Evello?
He talked. He's yours.
Probably they brought Bender along too fast.
He has simply been unable
to cope with McCoy,
who's a real tiger tonight bent on the kill.
McCoy has shown far too much experience...
far too much punching power for Bender
who is a comparative novice.
...seeking the telltale sign
that Bender had had it.
Gilmore apparently thought while Jim was
admittedly taking a thorough shellacking,
he still knew where he was
and what he was doing.
There's the 10-second buzzer.
They've removed the stools.
Bender's been doused with a pailful of water.
The young man is going out
into that carnage again.
The bell and Round 10.
McCoy leads with his left.
It's nicely blocked by Bender who counters
with a short right that curls behind the ear.
McCoy closes with a left hook which Bender
parries again, and they're in a clinch.
It's Bender who pushes McCoy out of it now
and Bender jabs lightly with the left.
Crosses with a-- Hey look out! It's Bender.
He scores heavily with that right!
McCoy may be in trouble.
I believe Bender has hurt him.
Yes sir! McCoy's eyes have a glazed look
and Bender's right on top of him.
Now it's McCoy trying to run,
and Bender is the man in pursuit.
He has McCoy in a neutral corner.
Jim Bender is on top, a jolting left hook--
Carver. Carver.
Carver?
I'm coming.
- Carver.
- I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Where'd you get those clothes?
Your friend Miss Wichman brought them.
Oh. When?
Yesterday.
She brought some perfume too.
I feel almost human.
Want to smell?
What is it? What's the matter?
What did she mean? "Remember me."
Read this.
"Remember"?
"Remember me when no more, day by day
you tell me of our future that you planned
Only remember me, you'll understand
But if the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once we had."
Read that last part again.
"But if the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once we had."
Mike? Mike!
Don't leave me.
They were at the door last night.
They tried to get in.
They tried to get in.
They tried to get in.
"They."
Better get your coat.
"If the darkness and corruption leave
a vestige of the thoughts that once we had."
But if it's a thought, it's dead.
Because she's dead.
It's got to be a thing.
Something small, something she could hide.
But where would she hide it?
She didn't have time at the gas station.
She swallowed it.
Then if she swallowed it, you've got it.
Close the door, please.
What is it?
No. That's all you get.
I paid you for it. Now hand it over.
I didn't say I'd give it to you.
As a matter of fact,
I don't recall saying anything.
I want it. Hand it over.
I performed an autopsy on that young lady,
and I found a key.
But whatever it is that's locked away,
I don't want it.
You have to find a fence and split the take.
That's too much trouble.
All I want is the cash right here in my hand.
So if you want this key...
pay.
No more.
Suit yourself.
H.A.C.
H.A.C.
You wait here. I'll be right out.
- May I help you, sir'?
- This key-- what's it for?
- Are you a member, sir?
- No. Just tell me about the key.
Pardon me, sir. If you're not a member--
My dear sir.
Now tell me about the key!
- It's a locker key, sir.
- Whose?
Just a minute, sir.
- It's, uh--
- Well, whose?
It's, uh, Nicholas Raymondo.
Ten-year membership, sir.
- Take me to it.
- Yes, sir.
This is it.
It's hot.
Hot, Sir?
Pardon me, sir. What is it?
I don't know. But whatever it is, keep away.
Don't let anybody near it.
Yes, sir.
Carver?
Carver.
Yeah.
Yeah, but check that bar he goes to.
Check his girl's apartment.
Keep somebody on watch there
in case he comes around.
Just a minute.
It's okay. He just came in.
- Where's the key?
- What key?
The key you took from Doc Kennedy.
I want it.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The key's very important.
- Don't waste my time. Hand it over.
- Is it as important as Velda?
If you hadn't sent Velda out to do
your dirty work, she wouldn't be in trouble.
- Now give me the key.
- Will you make a deal for her?
Please. The key.
Sure. You'll make a deal for her,
like you did for Christina.
You held her under custody in a hospital,
and you let her get away.
You let her get killed-- the way
Raymondo and Kawolsky were killed.
And Nick and maybe Carver, too,
for all I know.
- Carver?
- Yeah. Surprised?
What kind of an investigation
are you running around here anyway?
Lily Carver-- Christina Bailey's roommate.
We fished Carver's body out of the harbor
over a week ago.
You're so bright, working on your own,
you penny-ante gumshoe.
You thought you saw something big,
and you tried to horn in.
What about this dame
who's passing herself off as Carver?
How'd you get that?
Now listen, Mike.
Listen carefully.
I'm going to pronounce a few words.
They're harmless words--
just a bunch of letters scrambled together.
But their meaning is very important.
Try to understand what they mean.
Manhattan Protect. Los Alamos. Trinity.
Let's go.
- What about Velda?
- What about her?
- What about him?
- Let him go to hell.
Let the big slob sit there
and think about his girl...
what's likely to happen to her.
I didn't know.
You didn't know.
Do you think you'd have done
any different if you had known?
Diker?
Ray Diker.
The man you pointed out to Velda--
what's his name?
- What's his name?
- William Mist!
His name is William Mist!
Where's Velda?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

I thought it was him at the bar--
a dealer in abstract art or something.
I went over and just happened
to pick him up.
He dropped a few names.
Does that make your ears stand up?
Want to hear them?
Dr. Soberin.
Does that do anything for you?
Dr. Soberin. Does that do anything for you?
Dr. Soberin. Dr. Soberin. Dr. Soberin.
Dr. Soberin. Dr. Soberin.
Dr. Soberin's office.
Dr. Soberin, please.
I'm sorry.
Dr. Soberin isn't available at present.
He's referring all his calls
to this answering service.
Why don't you call another doctor?
I've gotta get him. It's important.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.
He might be at his beach cottage,
but there's no phone.
There is something sad
and melancholy about trips.
I always hate to go away...
but one has to find some new place...
or it would be impossible
to be sad and melancholy again.
What's in the box?
What's in the box?
Curiosity killed the cat,
and it certainly would have you...
if you'd followed your impulse to open it.
You did very well to call me
when you did.
Yes, I know. But what's in it?
You have been misnamed, Gabrielle.
You should have been called Pandora.
She had a curiosity about a box
and opened it...
and let loose all the evil in the world.
Never mind about the evil.
What's in it?
Did you ever hear of Lot's wife?
- No.
- No.
Well, she was told not to look back,
but she disobeyed and...
she was changed into a pillar of salt.
Well, I just want to know what it is.
Would you believe me if I told you?
- Would you be satisfied?
- Maybe.
The head of the Medusa--
that's what's in the box.
And whoever looks on her
will be changed not into stone...
but into brimstone and ashes.
But, of course, you wouldn't believe me.
You'd have to see for yourself, wouldn't you?
Where are we going?
Where I am going,
it is not possible for you to go.
I had no illusion about deceiving you.
You have the feline perceptions
that all women have.
Would you mind moving?
You're sitting on my coat.
Whatever it is in that box,
it must be very precious.
So many people have died for it.
Yes, it is very precious.
I want half.
I agree with you.
You should have at least half.
You deserve it...
for all the creature comforts
you've given me.
But unfortunately,
the object in this box cannot be divided.
Then I'll take it all.
If you don't mind.
Gabrielle.
Listen to me.
As if I were Cerberus...
...barking with all his heads
at the gates of hell.
I will tell you where to take it, but don't--
Don't open... the box.
Hello, Mike.
Where's Velda?
Come in.
Come in.
Kiss me, Mike.
I want you to kiss me.
Kiss me.
The liar's kiss that says "I love you,"
but means something else.
You're good at giving such kisses.
Kiss me.
Velda! Velda!
Velda!
Velda! Velda!
Mike! Mike!
- Mike!
- Velda!
Velda!
- Mike!
- Velda!
- Velda!
- Mike!
