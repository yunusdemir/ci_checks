-Thanks for coming all the way out here.
-Don't worry about it, man.
I've got a sailor
in every port.
- Do you know where we're goin' ?
- Yeah, I got, I got directions.
Oh, grand.
So, John,
you know, there's women
and there's ladies.
- Jojo's a lady.
- Yep.
- So, did you fuck her?
- What do you do
with information like this?
What do you think I do? You see
the way I live. Counting angry lovers.
Watching bad cartoons.
Gotta give me somethin'.

You're it !
( Mary ) Come on, boys.

( Sunny ) And now I'd like to introduce
our next artist from Steubenville, Ohio.
I'm tellin' you that so tonight

Did you call
the police?
No.
No?
Do you wanna die?
I don't know.
Did you see her die?
No.
I was drunk.
I didn't know
what happened.
I just feIt a bump.
And when I stopped, I knew something
had happened. I just didn't know.
She was lying
in the street...
all torn up.
And I could see her...
moving a little bit.
Her mouth
was kind of moving.
I thought she was
talking to someone.
You know,
someone
who wasn't there.
You know, someone...
like her mother,
her father.
When I got up to her,
I, uh,
I kinda kneIt down,
and she wasn't talkin'
to someone else.
She was talkin' to me.
She was apologizing to me.
She was apologizing
for not having looked both ways.
And there were some people who were...
gathering around there.
Somebody called
for an ambulance, so I--
They found me on the lnterstate.
I'd gone up north.
I just got in my car
and I drove until I ran out of gas.
( Sighs )
You have
such a beautiful face.
The way your eyes
slope.
- Like a little puppy.
- I'm sorry.
Don't say that.
I think...
( Sighs )
that your guiIt...
is a little too much
competition for me.
You should let me know...
when you want life.
( Car Door Shuts, Engine Revs )
( Car Drives Away )
( Keys Jangling ln Door Lock )
You are such
an asshole.
Where did you go?
I mean, like, what do you think?
Like you can just get up and go
in the middle of the night...
and go your merry fucking way,
and then stumble back in here
like it's not rude?
Like I don't have
any feelings.
And this means...
I have no emotions...
and I'm a whore.
And I liked you.
You know, I don't fuck
many guys. You know?

And in the meantime,
I've gotta listen to this music.
I hate this fuckin' number !
I like it.
He likes it.

Without tradition,

Oh, yeah. A Jew jeweler poet.

- Hello?
- Mary, it's Freddy.
- Freddy?
- Mary, please don't hang up. Please.
- Where are you, Freddy?
- I need--
- What?
- I'm fallin' apart, honey.
- Freddy, what's the matter?
- I just had this fucking dream.
What?
It's sunny outside
and I'm driving my car and it,
it feels real big
like it's driving me.
And I'm driving past Em's school,
the elementary school.
And there's a crosswalk.
( Breathes Deeply )
And all these little kids
are being...
h-helped across
by a crossing guard.
The crossing guard
is John Booth.
Em's one
of the little kids.
I'm gettin'...
closer and closer.
And I'm...
I'm hittin' the brakes.
The car won't slow down.
( Sobbing ) I'm turning the wheel...
but the car won't turn.
Oh, Freddy.
Freddy.
Then I just plow
right through... through 'em.
Then I--
Then I see Em's face...
just, just before...
just before I hit her.
Oh.
No, Freddy. No.
( Whispering )
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
( Dog Barking )
Two coffees.
Sit there.
( Sighs )
Oh, Freddy.
( Sighs )
Mary, I--
No, Freddy.
Let me talk.
I've been so angry at you...
for so goddamn long.
Too angry to see you,
or hear you or care about you.
But when I heard you
on the phone tonight,
I did see you...
( Sighs )
for the first time
since Emily was killed.
I can see
you're a good man.
And you loved her
so, so much.
But I loved her too,
Freddy.
I needed you so badly.
But you--
Do you remember...
when we were coming back from Vegas,
and the wind, God--
( Sighs )
The plane was bouncing
all around.
I thought--
I was shaking.
Do you remember
what you said?
No.
Uh, tell me.
- ( Waitress ) Anything else?
- No, thanks.
I couldn't believe
how calm you were.
And you took my hand
and you said-- Do you remember?
No, no.
Tell me.
You said,
"Pray we crash.
Then we can call ourselves
survivors."
( Chuckles )
You were so--
( Sighs )
Where'd that guy go?
Then Emmy died.
It's--
It's made you so small
and weak.
I needed you
to be big and strong.
I hated you
for your weakness.
I hated you.
Now I'm pitying you.
I don't know
how to help you, Freddy.
( Chuckles )
You look around...
at the marriages
people have.
We had a good one,
didn't we?
Yes.
Good times.
No hidden agendas.
None of the nasty bullshit
you see with other people.
( Sighs )
We were turned on.
We were hot
for one another.
- We were pals, right?
- That was a wonderful time.
Best buddies.
( Sighs ) Correct me if I'm distorted
in my thinking on this.
No.
No.
( Chuckles )
No, but...
you pity me.
( Chuckles )
( Sighs )
You pity me.
Oh, boy, this is a--
This is a funny thing,
this thing, this--
Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it.
"Freddy, whatever
you're doing, stop it."
I hope you die.
I hope you fucking die.
Come on ! Come on !
Come on !
Come on !
( Tires Screeching )
( Siren Wailing )
( Policeman ) Sir, pull your vehicle
over to the right.
- Sir, just stay in your vehicle.
- There's a gun on the seat.
There's a gun in the car?
Step back here, sir.
Step back here.
Step over here, sir.
Stop right there. Turn around.
Place your hands behind your head,
interlace your fingers.
Do you have
any other weapons on you?
No.
Spread your feet for me.
- I got a permit for the gun.
- You got a permit for the gun?
- Yes.
- Why do you carry a gun, sir?
I'm a jeweler.
I got a jewelry store.
It's all I have.
I carry the gun to protect what I have.
I can understand that. Do you
have the permit on you right now?
- Yes, it's in my wallet.
- Okay.
( Policeman ) Put your hands down
for me.
A .45, Dennis. It's loaded.
There's one in the chamber.
It's loaded?
Okay.
Take out your wallet, sir. Is your
driver's license in there also?
Yes, sir.
Here,
just hand it to me.
He says there's a permit
for the gun in there, so--
The reason we stopped you
is you were driving a little
erratically this evening, sir.
Have you had anything
to drink?
- I had a couple of drinks
a couple of hours ago, yeah.
- Blow on my hand for me.
All right.
We're gonna conduct a few tests
to see how much your ability
to operate a motor vehicle...
has been impaired by what
you've had to drink tonight.
The first test I want you to do is
I want you to put your feet together.
I want you to put your arms out to the
side and extend your index fingers out.
Okay, I want you to tiIt
your head back and close your eyes.
Now I want you to take your right index
finger and touch the tip of your nose.
Okay, just put your hand back
after you touch it.
I want you to take your left finger,
touch the tip of your nose.
Let's do
the left finger again.
- Okay, sir. Put your hands
down at your side.
- Permit's good.
The permit's good?
Okay.
I want you to come here and put
your right foot on the line here.
Okay, on this one, sir, I want you
to take ten steps down the line.
I want you to walk heel to toe.
I want you to put your left heel
to your right toe.
And I want you to count
the steps as you take them.
When you get down here, I want
you to turn around and take ten
steps back. You understand?
- Yes.
- Go ahead.
One, two, three,
four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.
Okay, just turn around, sir.
We don't need to go back.
I think, uh,
by what we've seen out here,
you've had a little bit
too much to drink tonight.
So, turn around, put your hands
behind your back. You're
under arrest for drunk driving.
Just turn around,
put your hands behind your back.
Freeze ! Stop !
Jesus.
Show us in foot pursuit.
( Policewoman ) 14-0-9. We're in
foot pursuit. Man with a gun.
Southbound on lnglewood from the 90
freeway. Request an air unit.
Stop, you son of a bitch !
( Dogs Barking )
( Policeman ) Stop !
I'm gonna shoot your ass !
( Grunting )
- Police officers, sir. Police !
- ( Man ) What's going on?
We just chased a guy with a gun
in here. Did you see where he went?
( Man ) I just heard my front door
bashed in. Then you got here.
- ( Policewoman )
Hey, the back door's open.
- ( Man ) I got kids here.
( Policeman ) Just stay with us, okay?
This guy's got a gun, sir.
Just stay with us.
( Footsteps, Door Opens )
Honey, you all right?
Yes, Daddy.
What was that noise?
I'll tell you about it in the morning,
sweetheart. Just get to sleep.
( Policeman ) We gotta go out back
and keep looking for this guy.
We'll send somebody back
in a little while and take a report.
Good night, sweetheart.

kid.
I got pulled over tonight.
Police, right?
The whole bit.
You wanna guess
what for?
Drunk driving.
( Chuckles )
Drunk driving.
And I had my gun.
I'm not particularly
acquainted with the law, but...
I'm on the run,
I'm on your property
and I got my gun.
I figure you could shoot me
and get away clean.
So, I'm gonna--
I'm gonna get my gun
out of my pants here.
And I guess I'm gonna try
and shoot you.
Huh?
Hey !
( Groans )
Hey, you son of a bitch.
Hey !
( Panting )
( Whispering )
Come on. Come on.
( Woman ) This just isn't working
for you out here.
Hey, what is the fare
for him and for me?
- ( Man ) I don't understand.
- ( Woman ) What don't you understand?
I come out here. I see you
don't have a cent to your name.
I wanna know what you're doing.
I don't get how you're makin'
any money. You're not making any money.
( Man ) I have a job.
Yes, I am making money. How can
you say I'm not making money?
( Man ) If I'm paying rent
and I'm eating, I'm making money.
- That's all you ever think about.
- You're not feeding yourself.
You're not paying your rent.
- ( Woman ) I don't understand
what you do for a living.
- You don't have to.
- ( Woman ) I do have to.
- I'm gettin' by.
- ( Woman ) Of course I have to.
- Why do you have to?
( Woman ) Because the creditors call
my house. I co-signed on your lease.
( Woman ) It's very easy for you to say
take your name off my lease.
- It's very easy.
- The wrong stop.
- lf it's gonna be this major thing--
- It is a major thing.
- And I want us to figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out,
especially right now, okay?
( Woman ) That's easy.
That's what you always do.
Not right now.
That's it?
- Whatever, okay?
I don't wanna talk about this.
- So, what's your job?
You don't listen.
- ( Woman ) I don't listen?
- What am I doing? I have a job.
( Man ) And I'm working.
I'm working for, you know.
- ( Woman ) For what?
- For money. And I've
been paying my rent.
( Man ) So I think I'm pretty set.
I think I've been doing pretty good.
I think that your standards are like,
like so high. So I don't have a car !
- ( Woman ) What're you doing?
- It's telemarketing. What's the
difference?
- It's telemarketing.
What's the difference?
- You answer telephones?
- Yeah, I answer telephones.
- And I hang up on people like you.
Well, you know.
Hey. It pays the rent.
