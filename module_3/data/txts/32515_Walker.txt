<i>In 1853, a small group of Americans
journeyed to Sonora, Mexico.</i>
<i>Their mission was to free that country
from a corrupt dictatorship.</i>
<i>Their leader's name
was William Walker.</i>
Walker's forces
will never slip away to the rear.
His men would rather die first.
Turn and fight!
They're only men and scared!
Be prepared to sacrifice yourself for freedom,
for justice, for religious convictions!
Stand up and fight!
Fight, you pigheaded bastards! Fight!
Fight!
What the hell are you doing?
Get back in, you bastards!
Shit.
Aw, fuck!
Brigade! Atten-hut!
Men of the
1st Independence Battalion.
We came to Sonora with the boldest hearts
and the loftiest of intentions.
But I will not
dissemble with you.
Reinforcements
have failed to arrive.
We are without food or water.
We're trapped.
Only an act of God
can save us now.
Crocker, prepare the men for departure.
We're returning home.
Yes, sir!
Mr. Fry, follow me.
This is a magnificent moment
for me!
It is a privilege to be at your side
at this great time.
Even if we are defeated, it doesn't matter.
We will live on in history.
Mon fr√®re.
Don't be so silly, man.
<i>Walker led his men
to the American border.</i>
<i>Unjustly accused of violating the neutrality
of Mexico, Walker was put on trial.</i>
- Order! Order!
- Quiet!
I demand quiet!
Does Mr. Walker
wish to make a statement...
...before the jury
decides on a verdict?
Yes, Your Honor.
Unless a man believes that
there is something great for him to do...
...he can do nothing great.
A great idea
springs up from a man's soul...
...agitates his entire being...
...transports him
from the ignorant present...
...and makes him feel the future
in a moment.
It is the God-given right of the American
people to dominate the western hemisphere.
It is our moral duty to protect our
neighbours from oppression and exploitation.
It is the fate of America
to go ahead.
- That is her manifest destiny.
- Hear! Hear!
Yeah!
Your Honor, we find the defendant,
William Walker...
Not guilty.
...not guilty.
Hey, where do we go next,
Colonel?
We must move southward.
Only by expanding can we hope
to avoid a civil war...
...and save those institutions
we hold most dear.
I assume you're including slavery?
Are you not, Mr. Squire?
I most certainly am, sir.
We must not be Sentimental...
...if we hope to preserve
that which is most precious to us.
- My sentiments entirely, Mr. Squire.
- Why, thank you, Mr. Morgan.
How absolutely right
we both are.
Screw your institutions!
Pardon me?
Miss Martin says that perhaps not all
of our institutions are worth saving.
Well, perhaps not.
However, I'm sure
the little lady will agree...
...that we must preserve
our way of life at any cost!
Otherwise, the barbarians will surely
stone the gates, and then where will we be?
Exactly. Well said.
Please have patience.
Go fuck a pig.
Pardon me.
I didn't get that.
Miss Martin has
a rather different view.
She positions herself rather on the side
of change rather than cultural preservation.
Well, that is very interesting,
my dear.
I didn't say that!
You can all go to hell!
Ellen. Please, Ellen!
Ellen!
I'm afraid she's not herself.
The strain of my recent trial.
Plus our approaching marriage.
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
Doctor, will you please take care of our guests?
Yes, William.
Gentlemen, the renowned Walker
has prepared a Statement...
...in the form of a quote
from President Buchanan.
"Expansion is the future
of our country...
...and only cowards
fear and oppose it."
Mr. Cole, will the Colonel
be returning to Mexico?
Mr. Walker has no plans for the moment
except to pursue his private affairs in peace.
You never represent me.
You're always paraphrasing
everything I say.
Censoring me.
And look at all your shit
in my house!
I hate it.
Get it out of here!
But I don't have a house.
Ellen...
I'm so desperate
whenever I'm around you.
Sweet Jesus, Ellen,
have mercy!
That man is no longer welcome
in my house... ever!
Don't be absurd.
Ephraim Squier is important.
Crucial!
He works for
Cornelius Vanderbilt.
If I run for office,
I'll need his support.
Who cares?
I hate all this talk
about Manifest Destiny.
It's a cover-up for slavery.
Ellen...
You know I despise...
I despise slavery!
Anyway, I thought you were going
to stay with me.
I am.
But I can't avoid
political discussions.
I'm a public figure, after all.
I don't trust you.
Ellen, please.
I promise I'll never leave again.
Please, Ellen.
I can't stand it when you're like this.
So what are you going
to do about it?
Walker! Walker!
<i>In the flurry of excitement
following his acquittal...</i>
<i>...Walker received an invitation
from that famous captain of industry...</i>
<i>...Cornelius Vanderbilt...</i>
<i>...considered by some to be the richest
and most powerful man in the world.</i>
Colonel Walker,
I'm so pleased to see you!
I can't tell you how happy
this will make the Commodore.
Give him some water,
would you, please?
Every day he's been asking,
"When will Colonel Walker arrive?"
- Is my horse going to be safe with that man?
- Yes, he'll be fine.
You have been very much
on his mind.
Central America, Colonel.
There's land,
and all of it there for the taking.
Think of it, sir.
From ocean to ocean. This way.
And the women, Colonel...
My God, the women!
Bare-breasted beauties...
...under trees laden with fruit.
Think of it:
Seven to every man.
If you please.
By the way, Colonel, have you had an
opportunity to read my book on Nicaragua?
No, I have not.
Well, then I will present you with
a signed first edition when next we meet.
It's my understanding you were educated
in Edinburgh, Scotland and Paris, France.
- That is correct.
- Good. The Commodore likes educated men.
And there he is,
the most powerful man on earth.
Don't be nervous, Colonel.
Just remember three things:
Do not sit unless he invites you to,
always address him as "Commodore"...
...and, under no circumstances,
ask for any personal favors.
Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt,
may I present Colonel William Walker?
Colonel of what?
The American phalange
in northern Mexico.
- You caused quite a commotion down there.
- We had a shortage of supplies.
No help from our government.
Otherwise we would have succeeded.
You fucked up, Walker!
Next time pick on a country
your own size.
Are you entitled
to wear that uniform?
I'm entitled to do
anything I want.
Mr. Vanderbilt, I came down here
on your invitation.
I did not come here
to be insulted.
- If you'll excuse me.
- Sit down!
Please. Colonel.
- Please.
- Sit down.
- Does Nicaragua mean anything to you?
- Nothing at all.
Nicaragua's a fucked-up little country
somewhere south of here.
This worthless piece of real estate
controls the overland route to the Pacific.
I now control
all transportation in Nicaragua.
But in order to continue to do so,
I need stability.
What's this
got to do with me?
Nicaragua's a divided country, sir.
It is in the midst of a terrible civil war.
- It is imperative...
- What I need is for some man...
...to go down there
and take over.
I want that country stable.
I want it done now!
They, uh... they tell me
you're a clever man, Walker.
Doctor, lawyer, surgeon ...
All that Renaissance rubbish
they talk about these days.
Well? Can you handle the job?
That's not the issue.
I plan to get married...
...start a newspaper.
Then you would be wasting
one of life's golden moments, sir.
It is not every man who is offered
the chance to have a country of his own.
Walker's goals involve a higher purpose
than the vulgar pursuit of personal power.
Do you prize democracy, Walker?
Universal suffrage?
The principles
of our founding fathers?
Yes.
More than my own life.
Nicaragua needs democracy,
Walker!
They need a canal as well.
I'm interested in Nicaragua, Walker,
and so are you...
...whether you know it now
or not.
Well, I'm sorry,
but I cannot oblige you.
- Good day.
- Now, Walker.
- Please!
- I like him.
Get him a new hat.
It was the cholera.
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for our sins...
...now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.
She's with God now, my son.
Don't talk to me about God!
What do you know about God?
Get out!
All of you, out! Get out!
Now!
But... how? How?
Oh, God...
I can't...
I don't...
God, you bitch!
<i>Walker determined not to look back
but to face only the future.</i>
<i>He accepted Vanderbilt's proposal
and set sail for Nicaragua.</i>
<i>With him were 58 men...</i>
<i>...whom the popular press saw fit to term
"Walker's Immortals."</i>
I am
Captain Siegfried Henningson...
...late of the Corsican campaign
and the Balkan fiasco!
I am well-schooled
in military matters, sir...
...having studied with Josef Penn,
Lubitsch and von Koch!
I would be honored, sir,
if you would accept my services.
I will, of course, provide for my own needs
and will require no financial assistance.
What is your name again, sir?
Lieutenant... Captain Siegfried Henningson
at your command, sir!
- You are now Major Henningson.
- Sir!
Cast off then!
<i>Never have I seen a collection of such
brave men assembled under one banner.</i>
<i>God bless them all.</i>
<i>The American phalange landed
at Realejo, Nicaragua...</i>
<i>...where we were met by distinguished
representatives of the Nicaraguan Liberal Party.</i>
- My brother, William Walker.
- How do you do, sir?
<i>These natives
were to be our guides.</i>
Start drumming, Mr. Turley.
<i>From the day the Americans
landed at Realejo dates a new era.</i>
<i>Not only for Nicaragua,
but for all Central America.</i>
What are you doing?
Move it!
You're on my shit list, Washburn.
<i>We paused at the small,
unregenerated hamlet of Realejo...</i>
<i>...to await the arrival
of the leaders of the Liberal Party:</i>
<i>Generals Munoz and Castellon.</i>
Proverbs, chapter 11,
verse three.
"The integrity of the upright
shall guide them...
but the perverseness of transgressors
shall destroy them."
Soldiers, we are now embarked
on a glorious destiny:
Nothing short of the entire
regeneration of this republic.
Ours is a sacred trust,
and any man who betrays that trust...
by creating an act of transgression against
the hospitality of the Nicaraguan people...
...will be judged
and dealt with accordingly.
There will be
no excessive drinking...
...no seducing
and no swearing in public places.
- That mean we can swear in private?
- Quiet! The Colonel's talking!
Gentlemen...
...we are honored guests here.
And we will act that way
according to the moral dictates of God...
...science and hygiene.
- Hear. Hear.
- That is all, Captain.
Dismissed!
What hygiene?
Hey, stop! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop!
Sanders, I know what you're thinking, but
believe me, even you can do better than that!
Achilles, you just stay out of this!
The Colonel says this is a democracy.
<i>Walker realized that he would need to keep
a firm hand on the moral conduct of the men.</i>
Immortals!
Aim!
Fire!
Men...
...as of this moment...
...we do hereby, under God
become citizens of Nicaragua.
If there is any man who would say no
to this great privilege...
...let him step forward.
It is our mission to introduce into the family
of enlightened & civilized nations a new sister.
To help us in our just cause...
...are two of
Nicaragua's Liberal Party...
and defenders of democracy...
Generals...
Generals...
- Damn it.
- Castellon and Munoz.
...Castellon and Munoz.
Three cheers for the Generals!
Three cheers for democracy!
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray...
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray...
- Hip, hip!
- Hear! Hear!
We march for Rivas.
As God is on our side...
...victory will be ours.
Hurrah!
It's a parrot, sir.
Aw, shit!
What the hell?
You chaps do crash about a bit.
Lost your way, have you?
- We're marching to Rivas.
- Really?
What on earth for?
We're liberating the country
for democracy.
How very peculiar.
You must be American.
Not no more.
We're Nicaraguans now.
- You draw that?
- Yes.
Why?
- What do you think, Captain?
- I think we ought to...
- What do you think of these new guns?
- I like them.
Six shots,
and good-lookin' too.
I wish we had them
for that firing squad.
We wait until nightfall.
Then we attack from the south
and from behind the church.
- We will go straight in.
- That's right, Colonel. I'm with you all the way.
Just jump right in and grab them by the throat.
Don't give them a chance to get set now.
Excuse me, but haven't we just been assured
by Generals Castellon and Munoz...
...that we're to be met
with no resistance?
Castellon
is an indecisive old man.
Munoz is a conceited troublemaker.
William, forgive me,
but these men are our allies!
At any rate...
...we will go in hard
with our eyes open.
First impression in a country
is very important.
Forgive me, but this is idiotic!
I prefer the last impression.
First and last
are often the same.
I didn't know you were a pedant,
Henningson.
History never smiles on pedants.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Lieutenant, may I have a word with you?
That pig! I, who have studied
military strategy with Lubitsch...
Colonel, sir, could I have a word with you
one moment, uh, alone, sir?
- Certainly.
- Shut up, Henningson!
What seems to be
the problem?
Well, there's no problem, sir.
I was just wondering though...
...perhaps maybe if I could be excused
tomorrow from being the drum major.
It's just that every time I've seen
pictures of battlefield scenes...
...and, uh, I always see the drummer boy
lying dead next to his drum...
...and, uh, if it's all the same to you, sir,
I'd like to trade my rifle in for a drum.
I mean, I'd like to trade
my drum in for a rifle.
As long as you are under my command,
no harm will come to you.
Lieutenant!
Straighten up.
You wanted to see me, sir?
Some men abandon all reason
before going into battle.
They become so seized with fear that
often the battle is lost before it's begun.
I know this will not
happen with you, Timothy.
Thank you
for your confidence, sir.
Sir, uh,
I feel I have to tell you...
The men are awfully confused about just
what exactly we're fighting for here.
I mean, I know, and they know,
that the liberals are our friends...
...and the conservatives are our enemies,
but, well, to tell you the truth, sir...
...I can't tell them apart.
They all seem the same to me.
That is no concern of yours, Timothy,
nor of the men either.
All you have to remember,
is that our cause is a righteous one.
I know that, sir.
I hope you do, Timothy.
I sincerely hope you do.
Get some sleep.
Yes, sir.
Turley, move them out!
Let's go, boys! They won't know
what to do without us! Come on!
Colonel, what are you doing?
I'm doing the only thing
I know how to do... advance!
You dumb shit!
There's no reason for you
to talk to me that way, Timothy.
Sorry, sir.
It's just you're going to get yourself
and everyone else killed.
Then we'll be together again,
won't we?
- We must get into a house, Colonel!
- For God's sake, why?
What?
For our own protection.
Yes. Yes.
- Good idea, Major.
- Come, please! Come!
- So, Dr. Jones, how is your day going?
- Just fine, William.
We have 11 dead,
several wounded.
- How 'bout yourself?
- Well, thank you.
Now that we have a plan, I feel sure
there will be a successful outcome.
Splendid, William!
- After you.
- No, no, no. I insist. After you.
- No, please.
- Well, let's go in together.
Very well.
- Colonel! There's a room back here!
- Is there a piano?
Yes, sir!
Take care of the window!
- Get your fat ass out of here, Washburn!
- But I'm hungry!
Why don't you serve him
if you admire him? Follow him!
God! I'm hungry!
You heathen! Come here!
- I'll shoot your eyes out!
- What's with that music?
Get him out of here!
Move it! Get him out!
Get him to a doctor!
We need somebody to dig through the walls.
It's our only way!
We don't have time.
We have to charge them bastards!
- Rout them out like we did before.
- Dear God!
We have repeating rifles!
They have muskets!
- We shouldn't stand a chance!
- We're soldiers!
- We kill people for a living.
- Yes, sir!
Shit!
The Colonel's leaving!
Move out! Come on!
Men!
- We must leave immediately!
- What about the wounded?
The wounded will have to
take their chances.
Go out the back when
the charge goes off!
You are not in command here!
We need another diversion.
The men'll charge
through the hole after the blast.
Nay, the powder
will be enough of a diversion!
That is not my
considered opinion, Major!
You men!
You, you, you, you, you!
After the blast,
charge through the hole!
- I'll go when you go!
- Everyone else, out the back!
- We'll meet outside the town!
- Damn it! Fuck you, Colonel!
Benito's not going through
no goddamn wall!
- Major.
- What?
No way.
Oh, wait, wait, wait! Wait!
- Open the door!
- The fuse is burning!
What happened here?
What went wrong?
Sons of bitches!
Cowards! Murderer!
Our American brothers came here
bringing peace, democracy and liberty!
And you killed them!
My God!
Protect these Americans...
...who came to our country...
...to improve our civilization...
...and strengthen our economy.
Long live Nicaragua!
Long live the United States!
<i>Suffering a temporary setback...</i>
<i>...and wishing to protect his men
at all costs...</i>
<i>...Walker decided to make a strategic
withdrawal to the seaport of San Juan del Sur.</i>
<i>As always,
his men's spirits remained high.</i>
Dr. Jones...
...when you were a little boy...
...did you ever have a moment
when you were sitting outside on the lawn...
...and you picked up a blade of grass
or a beetle, and you just looked at it?
And it was whole and perfect
and totally outside of time.
William!
Colonel, sir!
You're late, Cole!
You were supposed to come by sea.
But, Colonel,
I brought new recruits.
Prussian troops from Ecuador.
Magnificent tactics.
I commend you, General.
What do you mean, "tactics"?
Who is this man?
Victoire, mon g√©n√©ral!
I'm Bruno von Namzer.
√Ä votre service.
Je vous salue.
- Now, I take it, you will invade Granada.
- You mean you don't know?
Know what?
You have inflicted such heavy casualties
on the enemy that he has abandoned Rivas.
His troops are racked
with dysentery and cholera.
You broke their spirit,
William.
You are victorious.
You have won.
We won!
- We racked them with cholera & dysentery!
- Now is the hour of my destiny arrived.
- We have won!
- I cannot lose.
<i>Determined to end the civil war and
reconcile the divided nation...</i>
<i>...we marched upon Granada,
a bastion of conservative power.</i>
<i>The American phalange
entered the capital at dawn...</i>
<i>...where we were welcomed
as liberators.</i>
Captain Hornsby?
Immortals, charge!
Watch it! Watch it!
Here...you must...
Goddamn it! My arm!
Captain Hornsby,
I must protest...
Tag them and bag them!
Quiet, you ammo firers!
Listen up!
Colonel's about to speak!
Dismount the prisoners!
Citizens of Nicaragua!
Today the city of Granada and the entire
country of Nicaragua have been liberated.
It is our sacred duty to join together
and unify this great nation.
Today, however,
is a day of celebration.
Tomorrow we must...
Shoot the prisoners.
Kill them! Kill them!
It is not my time to die!
It is not his time to die!
The assassin's bullet...
...has struck correspondence from that
great Nicaraguan patriot General Castellon!
It is he
who has saved my life...
...as it is I who shall save the life
of this country!
Clearly this is
no ordinary asshole.
He has taken my town.
What am I going to do?
You'll do what you always do.
You'll make a deal.
Come on. Get ready.
Colonel Walker, we are here to thank you
from the deepest of our hearts...
...for the ending of our civil war...
...and bringing us
the precious gift of freedom.
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
- Hear. Hear.
What are we doing here?
What are your intentions
toward the office of the presidency?
Turn it down
and offer it to Corral.
You'll own him,
and everyone will be happy.
Tell them you'll take
commander in chief of the armed forces.
I am deeply grateful
for the extraordinary privilege...
...of being offered
such an exalted position.
However,
I must regretfully decline.
It would be more beneficial
to the country...
...if Walker were to protect
the democratic process...
...as commander in chief
of the armed forces.
- The army...
- Yeah!
The army...
Now we're talking.
I would therefore like to nominate
as president a great hero and patriot:
General Ponciano Corral.
Your country is primitive...
...but it's full of possibilities
for democratic advancement.
I have a weakness
for small men.
Small puritans
obsessed by power.
We must first establish agrarian reforms
before we proceed...
to equalize the social classes,
and above all...
Of course.
...We must separate church and state.
Don't you think?
I like to bring them
to their knees.
Gently...
...but always
in the proper position.
Yes.
We must make English the official language
so as to end discrimination against Americans.
We will end conscription.
Release the natives from the army so that
they may resupply the labor force.
The Amer...
The American phalange will...
- ...be responsible for national security.
- So you like my country.
And I do think we should provide for
free elections within the next 6 months.
If you think that's possible.
You are in my house,
Colonel Walker.
And you will do
what I want.
You must be patient with me,
Do√±a Yrena.
I'm a shy man
in these matters.
Look at that!
<i>Walker's Immortals initiated various
cultural and civic reforms...</i>
<i>...including the construction of a theater
in the traditional European style.</i>
I went to that shanty
you calling a house.
I went to give the girls a bath.
There was no water.
No water on Tuesday?
There was also no toilet paper,
no beer.
- This is Managua?
- No, this is Granada.
- Look at them flogging those kids!
- Come on!
<i>Walker, seeking literacy
above all other gods save hygiene...</i>
<i>...started a newspaper,
"El Nicaraguense".</i>
I know that guy.
He owes me 7 bucks.
Next thing you know,
they'll be instituting slavery.
It's the same racist, macho, sexist shit
we turned our backs on.
It doesn't have
the feel of victory in it.
It should be glorious and proud,
like the French revolution.
- Yeah, I think so too.
- But that's the way it was.
- That's beside the point, Mr. Doubleday.
- Well, what do you think?
- Shall I send a copy to the Commodore?
- Yes, absolutely, Byron.
- And ask him for more money, if you would.
- James, come on.
- Come on, come on!
- Hey, Billy, my man!
Top gringo
and heavyweight Generalissimo!
- We're his brothers.
- Really? I didn't know he had any brothers.
- Well, he does, okay?
- William, we came down as soon as we heard.
Everybody's talking about you in the States.
You're famous, man!
Yes, James.
Well, that's all relative, of course.
If you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.
Well, wait just a minute.
You know, we've been on the road for months
coming down here to help you out.
And all you can say
is you have a lot of work to do?
Yes. That's all I can say.
If you will excuse me.
Come on, come on, come on.
Maybe when you get
some time, huh?
It's good to see you, James.
You too.
Ellen...
Oh, Ellen...
Oh, Ellie...
Williams...
- Oh, Ellie...
- No...
Williams, don't be sad.
You were very good last night.
Not great,
but for a gringo good enough.
Williams...
But why?
They were your own men.
One must act with severity
or perish.
What are you... Hey! Put that down!
What are you, some kind of hick?
And don't give me that look!
I bring you down here
to the Paris, France of Central America...
...and you're behaving like you're still
in some hamlet in the woods some...
There's power for you, huh?
Man doesn't even recognize
his own brother.
- What about Honduras and Costa Rica, Byron?
- Hey!
- Don't you think they need democracy too?
- Hey!
Try to pay attention
to the matter at hand.
- Vanderbilt's plans are with Nicaragua...
- Hey, hey, hey!
Who the hell do you think you are, Willie?
I'm your goddamn brother!
You throw me a bone,
for Christ's sake!
Don't you ever talk to me that way
in public again.
You are welcome here
only if you contribute.
I have many brothers here,
and they're all equal in my eyes...
Don't give me that bullshit!
I don't believe in equality,
and neither do you!
You make me an officer
and give me some money...
...or, by God,
I'll stink up the place.
Yeah! Yeah.
You and James will be lieutenants.
Nothing more until you earn it.
What about the money, Willie?
Put me in charge
of the treasury!
Get out of my way!
Boys, he made me a General!
You're a Corporal.
<i>Walker realized that he
could no longer trust his former allies.</i>
<i>In particular, he determined to keep a
sharp watch on so-called President Corral.</i>
You must sign, Ponciano.
It's the only way
of getting rid of Walker.
I thought this Walker
was a friend of yours.
He has confiscated
my hacienda in Masaya.
Given it to his men.
The mad gringo
is ripping us off.
First our land...
What next?
Our mistresses?
For God's sake,
don't be childish.
You don't want to see him do that,
do you, Ponciano?
What are you doing, papa?
Nothing.
I have an interesting
letter here, sir.
"Lost is Nicaragua. Lost Honduras,
Salvador and Guatemala too...
...unless we all unite
against the gringo."
I want you to arrest Corral.
Of course, sir.
Assure him he will
receive a fair trial.
Don't worry, Colonel.
We'll take care of him.
William...
...want me to join them?
You'd better hurry, James.
Execution souvenirs,

<i>Corral was found guilty
of treason and sentenced to die.</i>
<i>The entire country
rejoiced at this news.</i>
<i>There was no doubt in anybody's mind
that justice had been served.</i>
William...
General Walker,
Corral is like a father to his people.
Then he is a tyrannical father
who would betray his children.
He was calling on foreign troops
to start an insurrection.
Treason must be punished.
I have no choice.
Do√±a Yrena says that it's...
it's a terrible mistake to kill Corral.
A mistake, General.
In this case, I entirely agree with her.
Morally, as well as politically, you will lose
everything you have gained... up to now.
She said something else.
She called me a name.
- What did she call me?
- She called you "a dog's asshole".
You know they are right,
William.
If you persist in this,
everyone will hate you.
I cannot help that.
Sometimes a leader must listen
to a higher law.
What you say may be true, but it is not,
in the final view, important.
- Listen to reason.
- I ask you never to speak of this matter again!
- If you want my opinion...
- Enough!
General Corral shall not be
executed today at noon.
He shall be executed
this afternoon at 2:00.
Fire!
- That son of a bitch has taken off.
- Probably Costa Rica.
- We need to find him and bring him back.
- A few rides after his funeral...
Do you know what it's like
out there in that damn country?
I may not, but I know
what it's like here...
...and I know we're in trouble
without a president.
Gentlemen,
if you want my view...
I don't, actually.
And neither does anyone else.
No need to get a wild hair
up your ass, Mr. Cole.
I was only making a suggestion.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Perhaps the time has come
for an election.
There has already been
an election.
I won.
Gentlemen...
- ...the morning paper.
- Thank you, Mr. Rudler.
Yes, sir.
Congratulations, Mr. President.
James!
What has this man
done to my newspaper?
We must send word
to Honduras.
Ask Guardiola to intervene.
Guardiola?
Guardiola is a butcher.
We need outside help.
- But we need guns more.
- You can't be serious, Yrena.
Arm the peasants?
- That's all we need.
- We must arm everyone...
...including our neighbors
in Latin America...
...if we really want to get rid
of these crazy gringos.
Son of a bitch
You're quite a hero
back in the United States, General.
- Do you have any plans to go back?
- Nicaragua is my country.
As long as I am needed here,
I will never leave.
Your country is in a state of chaos.
Guerrilla wars are taking place.
And yet, you refuse
to engage the enemy. Why?
A protracted war against scattered guerrilla
groups would not only be disheartening...
...and dissatisfying...
...but it would be too exhausting
for our American troops.
Have you anything to say
to the American people?
I certainly do.
"Climb on board Commodore Vanderbilt's
steamships and come on down and see us."
The truth is, President Walker...
...that Cornelius Vanderbilt
is taking advantage of you.
His transit company,
which guarantees overland passage...
...from the Atlantic to the Pacific
is not paying you what they should.
He is, to put it bluntly,
exploiting you and the entire country.
Shame, shame.
- Why are you telling me this?
- Simply put...
...we propose to start a new company
and make you an even better offer.
But to do this, you must revoke Vanderbilt's
license and grant our company one instead.
On most favorable terms,
of course.
You're telling me that Vanderbilt
has not been paying me what he owes me?
There's no question about that.
- That is inexcusable.
- No doubt.
But we mustn't forget that without Cornelius
Vanderbilt we wouldn't be here today.
That's true. Whatever good fortune
we have, we owe it to him.
Not only that, but he would be
a terrible man to cross.
I hardly think...
...gentlemen...
...that Commodore Vanderbilt...
...is responsible for my great...
our great victories in the field.
May I have a word with you, please, William?
I mean, Mr. President.
Certainly, Byron.
Anything you wish to say, you may say here.
Walker does not resort
to whispers and subterfuge.
Our great victories
notwithstanding, William...
...we are utterly dependent
upon Cornelius Vanderbilt.
His ships are our lifeline
to the United States.
They provide us with money,
munitions, medicine and men.
We cannot risk
incurring his displeasure.
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
Gentlemen...
...it was granted to me
in our recent constitution...
...that I have the authority and the autonomy
to do whatever I want. Don't I?
- Don't I?
- Absolutely, Mr. President. Absolutely.
- Don't I?
- Ja. Yes, sir.
Don't I?
Yes, you do.
I will not be betrayed
by a man as vulgar and insidious...
...as Cornelius Vanderbilt.
I will, therefore,
revoke his permit.
I will also commandeer
his vessels.
From this day on, they will be
the property of the Republic of Nicaragua.
- You cannot be serious!
- Want to bet?
Surely, President Walker, it might be more
advantageous to be a little more diplomatic.
Not to use force,
but rather diplomacy.
For you, perhaps, but not for me.
Excuse me, gentlemen, I have work to do.
Forgive me, sir, but I must contradict you.
Your work is here!
Sir! Come back here!
I've had it with you,
foreign weasel!
You have the nerve to come over here
barely speaking the language.
Taking our jobs!
Pole axing our women! Take that!
And that! And that!
You bastard!
I cannot help noticing, sir,
during the time I've spent with you...
...that you've betrayed every principle
you've had, all the men who supported you.
May I ask why?
No, you may not.
I'm still not clear
on what exactly are your aims.
- The ends justify the means.
- What are the ends?
I can't remember.
You two scumbags went behind my back
and cut into my action!
Nobody does that!
Do you understand?
Nobody fucks with Vanderbilt!
We are both sure,
Commodore Vanderbilt...
...that we can reach
some sort of accommodation.
- After all, we are all civilized men.
- Civilized men?
From now on,
you're going to be shoveling shit!
And if your mouths are not too full of it,
you'll thank me for the privilege!
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
- That's how civilized I think you are!
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
You've not only betrayed the Commodore,
you've betrayed yourselves...
...by putting faith
in that lunatic extremist Walker.
Now look.
You've upset the Commodore.
What were you thinking of?
Did you seriously imagine this pathetic
madman was in charge down there?
- No, of course not. We didn't...
- Get out of here! Both of you!
What should we do about Walker?
No one will remember Walker.
No one will remember
men who lose.
Look at that fat cat Walker.
Strutting about
as if he was a king.
One thing he didn't ken,
it's Vanderbilt that's running the show.
If he ever opposed the bloke,
we'll be up to our necks in shit.
What have I got, Doctor?
It's cholera.
What means this shouting?
I fear the people choose
Caesar as their king.
While men...
That's mine.
Another general shout!
I do believe that these are for
some new honors heaped on Caesar.
Why, man, he doth bestride
the narrow world like a colossus.
Hey, bring on the darky!
And we petty men...
...walk under his huge legs,
and peep about...
- ...to find ourselves...
- Where are you going?
You bastard!
We are in crisis on all fronts.
We must have your attention.
Is there no way you could not have
waited till at least intermission?
The men are going mad.
They're defacing the cathedral...
- ...pillaging the precious artifacts.
- The priests must take their chances.
- This is war.
- Mr. President...
...the men are
on the point of mutiny.
- No, they are not.
- Are you all right, sir?
Vanderbilt has diverted
his steamships to Panama...
...cut off our supplies!
We have no new recruits...
- ...no money, very little ammunition!
- Very little ammunition!
We have lost control
of Le√≥n, Masaya...
- Chinandega, Matagalpa...
- ...and every major Nicaraguan town.
- Rubbish!
- Defeatist nonsense!
Pure unadulterated horseshit!
- Food!
- Booze!
- Money!
- Justice!
Food! Booze! Money! Justice!
Food! Booze! Money! Justice!
- You...
- What?
- ...are a disgrace!
- I'm a disgrace?
This whole operation is
a fucking disgrace, Your Worship!
You are stripped of your rank.
You can either stay here as a private
or you can leave.
Hey, private this, Willie!
Anderson.
- Holy shit!
- Hey, hey, hey!
Ah, shit!
Give me his medals!
Give me his medals! I want his medals!
Mother never liked you anyway.
Let me have men
about me that are fat.
Yon Cassius has
a lean and hungry look.
He thinks too much.
Such men are dangerous.
Men...
...I have found a solution
to our problem.
- Slavery.
- Yeah!
What do you mean?
- We don't need no slaves!
- We need money and weapons.
- And medicine.
- Fuck you, Walker.
Silence!
We will introduce slavery
into Nicaragua.
The South will have no choice
but to rally to our cause.
That's pure nonsense!
<i>There were rumors that several neighboring
countries had invaded Nicaragua.</i>
<i>Walker sent out agents
to see if this was true.</i>
<i>None of the agents returned.</i>
"The Indian of Nicaragua in his fidelity
and docility and in his capacity for labor...
...approaches nearly the Negroes
of the United States.
In fact, the manners of the Indian towards
the ruling race are now more submissive...
...than those of the American Negro
to his master."
"The advantage of Negro and Indian slavery
in Nicaragua will therefore be twofold.
While it will furnish a certain labor
for the use of agriculture...
...it will also tend
to separate the races...
...and destroy the half-castes
who cause the disorder."
"The Battle of Rivas,
June 29, 1855.
Not more than a dozen went out
to drive away upward a hundred.
And their charge swept
the enemy completely away.
There was no thought of rank.
But each one went forth
with his revolver...
...ready to do the part
of a true man in the fray.
Never have I seen a collection of such
brave men assembled under one banner.
God bless them all."
I have studied with Josef Penn!
I have studied with Lubitsch
and von Koch!
And you have the presumption
to talk to me of military tactics.
Bruno... and the Germans...
...they have a vision.
Always be
a straight shooter, James.
I like the sound of that.
I must speak with you.
- I don't understand.
- There is no time.
You speak...
I have spoken to you in many ways,
but you have not heard me.
But now you must, Williams.
Everything depends on it.
Did you see this?
I beg you. Please!
If we have a lot of death,
we will have a revolution.
We must not have that
if we are to survive.
We are both aristocrats.
I am not an aristocrat.
I'm a social democrat.
What's the matter with you?
I only want what is best
for the Nicaraguan people.
I'm surprised at you.
Now leave me alone.
I have important work to do.
- Are you quite sure of that?
- Absolutely!
- And shut the door on your way out.
- Okay.
God...
Yrena, what are you doing?
Bruno!
Instruct the men
to burn the town.
Yeah...
What are you doing? Idiot!
You are an idiot!
Idiot! Idiot!
What is this?
Walker! Walker! Walker!
You men, get the Colonel's brother's body
out of here.
- Mr. President.
- It's been a long time, Doc.
It doesn't seem like it.
- Mr. President!
- Yes.
Granada has been put
to the torch.
- How many have we lost?
- Nearly all, sir.
We must leave immediately.
I will speak to my men
one last time.
- Immediately!
- I insist, Major.
Sir, I... my arm!
Immortals, attention!
Unless a man believes that there is
something great for him to do...
...he can do nothing great.
A great idea springs up
in a man's soul.
It agitates his entire being.
Transports him
from the ignorant present...
...and makes him feel
the future in a moment.
Reduced to our present position
by the cowardice of some...
...the incapacity of others
and the treachery of many...
...we are yet writing
a page in history...
...that it will be impossible
to forget or erase.
You all might think
that there will be a day...
...when America will leave
Nicaragua alone.
But I am here to tell you,
flat out...
...that that day
will never happen...
...because it is our destiny
to be here.
It is our destiny
to control you people.
So no matter how much you fight,
no matter what you think...
...we'll be back...
...time and time again.
By the bones of our American dead
in Rivas and Granada...
...I swear that we will never abandon
the cause of Nicaragua.
Let it occupy your every
waking and sleeping thought.
From the future,
if not the present...
...we may expect
a just judgment.
- What about the prisoners?
- Shoot them!
You heard the Colonel.
Shoot the prisoners!
I have been instructed
by the State Department of the USA...
...to return all American citizens
to their homeland.
I'm an American!
Yes!
Sorry, only U.S. citizens.
Only U.S. citizens.
That's it.
U.S. citizens! U.S. citizens.
Get your hands off me!
Goddamn it, get them off!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
My arm!
What is your nationality, sir?
I'm William Walker, president
of the Republic of Nicaragua!
I'm sorry, sir.
Move it out!
Colonel!
<i>Let me say to those who invoke
the memory of Vietnam...</i>
<i>...there is no thought of sending
American combat troops to Central America.</i>
<i>Maneuvers designated
Operation Big Pine...</i>
<i>...are being conducted less than 10 miles
from Honduras' border with Nicaragua.</i>
<i>Nicaraguans consider the exercise
a serious act of aggression.</i>
<i>The United States insists
the maneuvers are purely defensive.</i>
<i>This maneuver is designed to help
the Hondurans to defend their own country.</i>
<i>And it doesn't... it doesn't envision
any involvement of U.S. ground forces.</i>
<i>So far, 80,000 U.S. troops
have participated in the maneuvers.</i>
<i>Those leading the exercises
say it's all being done...</i>
<i>...for the sake
of peace and self-defense.</i>
<i>The political side of the U.S. presence
here was not lost on some of the troops.</i>
<i>It's kind of to show it to,
like Nicaragua.</i>
<i>Yeah, I think we're sending
a message to them.</i>
