Mother
Have you washed your hair?.
Always trying to be Elvis,
you'll never make it!
Y eah, just fooling around
Do you like the kite?.
Take a look! Ellen!
Hey man!
You got the wrong guy, my husband's innocent!
Frank! Still pissing around?.
I'll kill you
Told you to watch out for cops!
Your dad got arrested!
Mom!
I'm your son!
Dad, quit this sweeping job
When I get a job, you can...
Its destiny, I'm a nobody, its okay
But my son won't be sweeping streets
It's a cruel world, money talks
Without it you're shit!
Remember! If you get a break, hang on in there!
Joint our strike!
Against oppression, act now
- Fight for equality
- Come on!
Put a few more up here
- Here comes prince Charming, no wonder
- Ben
- Here for Jane
- Treat her will, or you'll regret it
Here's an orange to shut you up!
Don't go, don't go
You too!
- Work okay?.
- It's okay!
What the hell?. It's sour!
Let's go
The bastard! Get lost!
Hey stop it!
Stop it...
Wash up those glasses! So slow!
Hey! Watch out!
Hey! What's up!
Hong Kong sucks!
We'll never get nowhere in this place
I don't want to be a nobody
for the rest of my life
Wherever you go,
count us in!
Y eah, we're just like windflower
Settled down to wherever the wind take,
we're all orphans here
One day, I'll come back in a Mercedes
Lets not wait, we'll go drive a Mercedes now
Who lose, who treat!
It is a deal!
You'll lose!
You're gonna lose, Paul!
No way, I'm winning!
Don't fall in the sea. Frank!
No sweat, watch out!
You watch out!
Frank, go get it!
Hang on
Cut the crap, help me up
Punk fell in the gutter...
"His girl's gonna cry"
"His body's so stinky"
"she doesn't find it kinky"
"Smells like ammonia"
"He's mad that he fell"
"Gutter smells isn't so swell"
The riot is worsening, I'm afraid
I wonder what the future would be like
Let's get married
We're poor. How can we have money for our wedding?.
Poor can marry
No matter what the future would like
Just want to be a bird
And be free to fly around
Go places, see the world
I know there are great places out there!
I want you to come too
Are you dreaming?.
It's not a dream!
Its my ambition! Many people don't even have that
Pay respect to your in-laws
Ben, mind the knees!
Make room, Marilyn Monroe's here!
Going down, careful
Paul, be careful, mind the shit!
You're great! In this situation...
your wedding is more incredible than
the wedding of third uncle
Don't say that
Frank!
What are you doing here?.
Is the banquet money okay?.
No problem, trust me, don't worry!
Are you sure?.
No problem! Get inside
Frank, remember to change out of the shit
- T o inside, go on!

Cheers!
Thanks for coming, help yourselves, drink up
The bride and groom, photo time

Really?. Sorry, sorry man
Let me through, its important, please
Son of a bitch
Punk
I know you've been to see Kwai
Give me the cash
That's enough. Ringo
You've made a fool out of me,

We'll fight again one day!
But this money is staying with me!
Shithead, you ain't got no choice
No... You can't
- No?.
- Come on
Bastard
Give it back
You bastard
Drink up
Mr Shing, show me how to make a buck
You gotta take risks!
T ake my word for it
The more chaos, the easier the cash
Vietnam's at war, there's no law and order
Smuggling, drugs,
anything goes to make a buck
Lots of millionaires started this way
What's bugging you!
Frank's not here,
hope nothing's wrong!
Don't worry, he's always like this
Thanks for coming
Thank you!
Hey, Franke
Here comes Mighty Mouse, Ben, Ben!

Nothing what?.
Oh that?. Fell in the gutter
I was rushing, fell down!
In a gutter?.
Y eah, yeah, Punk in the gutter
Frank you'll never grow up!
His girl's gonna cry
You're terrible
Smelly like stale fish
And his girl's gonna fry
Hey, as your pal, can I kiss the bride?.
- Come on,
- It's late, move
No sweat, only her hand, she's safe
He's really coming!
Congratulation, all the best
Don't let him kiss you!
I've asked Ben, he said you hand's okay
- Right Ben?.
- Jane, don't let him!
He cheated, he kissed my face!
Guys, stop that, it'll get creased to
Shut up! You guys are always the boss
What's this boss crap?.
We're all just trying to make a buck
We're buddies right?.
And buddies are all equal
Punk, spineless worm, piss off!
You got me arrested, you only know how to fight
- Got beaten again
- Dad, forget it!
Please making a scene!
So what?.
Bastard!
You good for nothing!
Just piss off, don't come back!
Scram!
Get lost!
I don't care! You're not my son!
It's you?. What's the matter?.
What happened to your head?.
Nothing! I fell in a gutter
Its nothing! Only a bit of blood
I'm used to getting beaten up by mom
Nothing new!
Hey
You crazy?.
If it's only bruised it won't hurt so much
You've been bleeding all night, it must hurt
Now will you tell me who did it?.
Ringo
He wanted to take it
I wouldn't let him, so he did this
With what?.
A glass bottle
Hey! What are you doing?.
Give to the poor, thank you
Okay?. Go on!
What are you doing?. Stop?.
Stop!
- Stop!
- Get him!
Stop!
Ringo!
Did Frank cross you?.
He made me mad!
Go to hell!
Die, die!
Ben... Ben...
Paul, open up!
What happened?.
We killed Ringo
What now
I don't know, run I guess
Wait a second
Sorry
I really got you screwed, and Jane too
We owe you so much
Is Ben there?.
What's the matter?.
He's wanted for murder, we're looking for him
Ben, Frank
- Paul!
- Fatso!
I brought you lots of food
We're you followed
No, I was smart this time, here, bread
Change your clothes, change your look,
then no one will percept you both
Lots of people on your back!
The police, Ringo's boys
And Mr Kwai's out for you Frank
Y eah?.
How's Jane?.
She's okay, the cops talked to her, she's scared!
Don't worry,
I'll look after her
I got your passports
Thanks Mr Shing
I've got a friend called Luke overthere
He'd help you to solve problem
T ake these two boxes of penicillin,
Rolexes and medicine
T o the Saigon coast,
hand it to Mr Y. S. Leung
No tricks,
- he's dangerous
- I got it, Shing
Overthrow the government, we want liberty
Overthrow the capitalism; longlive to Communism
Overthrow the British government, we want liberty
Come back
It's dangerous. Riot outside. Come back
Be careful
Jane
What are you doing here, go
I want to talk to you!
I don't want to hear!
It is dangerous here, follow me!
Let's go
Feel hard?.
Run,
or you'll be recognized by the police
I have to leave Hong Kong for a while
You do whatever you want to do, as usual
You even killed somebody in the wedding night
Don't worry, Jane
I'll be back to take you away
Forget it, everywhere is the same
The future cannot be foreseen, God knows
Anyway I'll take care of myself
T ake care
No matter what,
the goods come first. It's over lifeline
Its so peaceful, don't seem to be at car
Who gives a shit, war's their problem
They're killing Vietnamese, nothing to do with us
We're here to get rich!
Then move on to Thailand!
Will we make it
No sweat! Smugglers, they're all millionaires
With a new place there's new hope
And this is our new hope
Guess how I'm gonna spent my first million!
Buy yourself a Mercedes! That's obvious!
Dummy! Would I risk my life my
life for a pissing mercedes?.
Either I don't go back, if I do, I go back loaded!
If I make a fortune, first
I'd buy my mom loads of embroidered slippers
Then she can't hit me with her wooden clogs!
I only want to go back for Jane
Then I'll get you your ticket!
You're funny
Wow! What a scene!
Hey! What's a happening
Get out!
Why?.
Bomb!
Explosives!
- Grab the goods!
- Forget it!
Come on! Let's run!

There are tons of girls like her!
Oh my god!

Why should you help me?.
Because we are Chinese!
Wait for me at the bridge tomorrow!
Promise to come. It's a deal!

Originally, we brought some goods

Unfortunately we ran into

Get something out of Leung!
But this is not our original plan!
You want to be in jail in HK?.
You want me to lead a dog's life forever?.
I've forgotten I have a father who is a sweeper!
What you want?. Please don't!
T oday I saw some soldiers killed people,
I learned something!
In this world, if you have guns,
you have everything!
Tell me how much is a human life!
I'm a bit worried you'll get involved!
Leung is so powerful because he's got weapons
I need gun!
I'm not sure it's right or wrong,
but anyway I'll try my best to help you
Wait!
What is going on?.
I want to prove something!

Don't worry, Jane
I'll be back to take you away
Forget it, everywhere is the same
The future cannot
Be foreseen
I'm sure I cannot get away!
A year ago, Leung signed me
up to sing in this nightclub
He told me I will make a lot money!
At that time, I was only dreaming...
I arrived Saigon, he held up my passport
And did not allow me to go away...
He even forced me to deal in drug,
trafficking, and made me a whore
I won't want to see you dead
You're my little money maker
In 1 0 years time you'll forget everything
Forget you been in Saigon
Forget you were a whore, won't that be swell?.
There's no one to help you?.
Y es...
Please get me out of this shit
Please...
We sneaked out to see the boats here
We wish one day we can get on one
of these boats and flee away
Let's go!
I want you to kill people only!
I did tell you to take her away
Don't worry! We traveled here by boat!
We'll traveled back by boat too!
Are you sure there will be guns?.
Don't worry, just go by the plan
We gotta trust him
Y eah, that's what friends are for!

How is it?. Had something to drink?.
A bit
A bit isn't enough! Come, get some more glasses
You're all gotta drink
Do you know her?.
You Hong Kong boys are real Romeos!
Got your eyes on my girl
before the deals even done!
Mr. Leung, you got it wrong, we didn't mean it
We just like her singing
I also heard, you wanted to take her with you!
She's my trump card,
I spent a lot of gromming her
Mr. Leung, you got it wrong
We already liked Sally
when we were in Hong Kong
Loved her singing
We were staring at her
because it was strange
She seemed to have changed!
She's not beautiful any more
Ben!
She's lost her innocence
She's not happy anymore
What sort of grooming is that?.
Are you accusing me?.
No one else dares to talk to me like that!
Young man, you've got guts!
Bring the booze
Let's empty the bottle
I made the screw up, its my fault!
I'll drink!
Right! Real buddies!
Since you're buddies,
all three of you drink!
Ben! What are you doing?.
- You call yourself our pal?.
- Don't let him step on us!
- Aren't you being selfish?.
- What did you say
Don't let him step on us!
You screwed up,
don't drag me into it!
I did that for all of us
Stop it!
What are you two fighting about?.
You hit me?.
Serves you bleeding right!
Ben!
Yu traitors!
Bastard
Watch over Ben
Old shithead! Pull him up!
Run!
Run! Quick!
Go back, quickly!
Let me go, let me go...
Don't come over!
Don't move! Or I'll kill him!
One step more and I'll shoot!
Help!
Don't come over!
Kill them!
Let me go or you'll die!
- Ben, where are you going?.
- Ben
Bitch! You're not going any where!
Sally!
Where is Ben?.
- Frank!
- Help! Quick!
- Let me go!
- Don't move!
Sally, Sally
Will we make it?.
Let's go now?.
Watch out!
Are you guys crazy?. Stuck with this dame
Do you wanna get us killed?.
I promised her I'd take her away
That's your dame business, leave me out
Stop it Paul!
If we're still buddies
Its not important
Let's get the hell out first!
No way! You'll never leave!
Stop fighting!
Get down
The gold leaves, where is it?.
Luke! Where is the gold?.
Where's Sally's passport?.
I don't know
You said it was here! Where's the gold?.
In the safe
Where is Sally's passport?.
You'll get it over my dead body
Where the hell is Sally's passport?.
Speak up!
You'll have to kill me first!
I bet its in the safe
Bastards! You won't get of here alive
Sally, don't worry
Ben will help you, even without your passport
We could be refuges,
sneak over to Hong Kong
Sally
You see! I told you not to worry
We'll get back to Hong Kong, right?.
Hey! Release Mr. Leung
T ake your clothes off
Not Mr. Leung, he's our brother
Go to hell!
Where's my passport?.
My passport's gone!
Sally keep cool!
Bitch!
Sally!
Stay away
Help!
Bastards! Don't touch my gold!
How dare you take my gold! My gold!
You can't, give it back...
Let her go!
Okay! I'll let her go
Sally!
Sally!
Don't move!
Stay away!
Or I'll kill them
Don't move! Wanna die?.
This is Vietnam, you won't get out alive!
Come on! You shut up!
Punk, you won't get out of Saigon!
No way!
Shut up!
Drive, just go on!
Go on! Quickly
Come on!
Drive on!
Ben, get in, quick, quick!
Don't let them get away
You must get them
Get in, quick, quick!
You'll be alright! Don't worry!
What do we do?.
Don't worry, I used to work for the CIA,
I'll handle it
What are you doing here?.
Sorry sir, I have a pass
Sir, what's going on?.
We're being attacked by Vietcongs,
its dangerous here
You better get out of here
One of our friends is seriously hurt
We must move her to another town urgently
- Okay, but take care
- Thanks
Let them pass
Can't turn back now!
Lets just get through! Quick!
Help me, take me...
What are you doing?. Go away, piss off...
Piss off, go, get lost!
They're so pitiful
Move, move! Bastards!
Drive on, faster!
Frank, start from there,

Hang on
You'll be okay
Will we make it?.
We'll get away! The boat will
leave soon, don't worry
Really?.
Really! Believe me
I told you, once we have the change to leave
We'll go back to Hong Kong together
Be strong
You'll make it back to Hong Kong
I've got a record of yours at home
Waiting to be autographed
Hey! Luke, is this boat coming?.
If those Vietnam bastards get here, we'll be dead!
Is that boat for real?.
Hey! What do you want?.
Answer me okay?.
Are you human?. Spare a thought for us
You only care about your gold, what about us?.
Are you blind?. Can't you see?.
Frank!
What are you doing?.
I feel like shit!
Ben, the boat's here!
Why did it take so long?.
Last night there was a Vietcong attack,
its dangerous
Stop the boat up front first
Up front... Up front...
Sally, the boat! The boat's here!
Hey! Stop the boat! Stop! Stop!
Can't stop! It's too dangerous!
- Stop!
- I can't wait for you!
Go on! No! come on!
Go on! I'll give you gold!
Help me please!
- Come on!
- Quickly...
Ben, I'll cover you,
get on the boat, quick!
Paul
Ben! Quick! Quick!
Wait!
Sally, Sally...
Sally, Sally...
They're catching up!
Luck, get on the boat! Luke!
Luke, Luke!
Go, Luke
Let her go, let go now!
Shit! Why doesn't the boat move?.
God damn!
Hey! Give us a hand now!
If those damn Vietcong get us we're dead!
God damn it! Aren't you guys worried?.
The boat's screwed!
Come and help! Stop sitting there like statues?.
Luke, can you fix it?.
I know you're upset over Sally's death,
so am I!
But its better this way?. She won't drag us down!
We're scared shitless
not knowing how much longer we'll die
Isn't that worse?.
If this boat sinks,
we'll lose all this gold
Hey! Don't touch my gold!
Hey, Ben, put it back!
Hey! Stop doing that, or I'll shoot!
Come on!
Put the gold down!
Are you crazy?.
Go on! If you shoot I'll blow your head up!
For me I'm already dead,
but I don't want to lose the gold
Frank, put the gun done
Put the gun down!
Are you putting this gold before your friends?.
Do you still know what friends are?.
Do you know what you're doing?.
You're pointing your gun
at a buddy of over 1 0 years!
Do you measure your friendship in gold?.
Is this enough?.
Over 1 0 years of friendship...
That friendship is over,
we're not friends anymore
Shoot then!
I've known you for over 1 0 years
Over 1 0 years! If you want you can kill me!
Shoot! Go on shoot...
Please stop throwing it away! I'm sorry!
That's all I'm asking for
All I want in this life is simple
Just this box of gold, is that too much?.
This boat is sinking
We better do something about it?.
Do you want to die?.
I want my gold!
Let's jump!
Quick jump!
The gold, the gold...
Paul
My gold!
Paul, come on now, Ah!

Help me... Help!
The gold's too heavy...
The gold...
You wanna die?. Forget about the gold!
Let's go!
Don't you wanna live?.
You can let me die, but I want my gold!
Damn your gold! Damn, damn it...
If I'd known, I won't have bothered saving you!
We'll go and find Luke
Come if you want if you don't you can stay

We are quite lucky though...
We have a chance to see our friends again....!
Any news from Frank?.
He's still alive!
Really?.
I wish I did not bring him back
He's not the same Frank anymore!
He didn't even know who he is!
I saw Frank shoot him in the head...
He didn't die, it's just a miracle!
Maybe he wants to se his old friends
before he dies!
Give me the money, and I will kill him for you
Take me to see him...
Frank!
Frank. It's me!
The bullet is still in his head
Even though he has an operation
He will become a vegetable
Frank... Frank...
Stop it!
Frank, Frank!
Frank...
Please don't!
Don't do that...!
Give me...
Frank. Stop it!
Frank...Stop it...!
Did your hear?. Frank
Don't fight, you will die!
Frank
Why don't you save some for me?.
We agreed...
...we'll share everything in life!
We were like brothers since we were kids
We fight together...
We cruise chicks together...
You called me brother the time
I told you we can just be friends
Friends are all equal
Frank.
You get so many scars in your head
Beaten up by your mother, remember?.
Because you were so naughty,
that she had to beat you up
It rained heavily the night I get married
We did not have enough money to pay the bill...
If not because your loan!
We could not afford to get married!
At that night,
Ringo, hit your head with a bottle
But you didn't let me know
You're an introvert!
You keep everything to yourself
I'd like to listen to you, just a few words...
Just a few words...!
Come on...!
Does it ring a bell?.
I'm Ben
I don't mean that!
I can't see you like this!
Didn't you tell me you want to go to Hong Kong
The world is changing...
I'm used to me own way of life
All of a sudden, I have to make a change
I just can't...
I've got to go back!
That's my home!
It's a long way to go...
I've got to go back!
Take care!
Take care!
Sugar cane juice...
60 cents pleases...
He's not feeling so well these days...
Be good, eat something...
Ben! You're back, great...!
He's name is Frank
Boss, Mr King says he's ready for the meeting!
I think it's time for me to retire
The world belong to the young people
Paul is a very capable person
We made money,
we spent all...!
Even the government could not lay a finger on us!
Have guts, and friend enough!
I seldom make a wrong choice!
Paul will be the most suitable successor!
Congratulations...
Thank you, Mr. King...
I'll try my best to fulfill my duties...
I won't disappoint you!
I have never disappointed myself...
Congratulation, Paul
Thank you
An old friend of Paul
wants to see him!
Okay...anyway. We're through!
Show him in...!
Ben, when did you come back?.
Let me introduce, Mr. King!
Mr. King, this is Ben,
my old friend
He stickled with me throughout my time in Vietnam
So thrilled to see you again, really!
I'm so happy to see you...!
Half of mine is yours!
What about Frank?.
Frank?.
He kept telling us to leave him
behind when he was wounded alone
And go with you to Hong Kong
I wanted to help him, but I was badly wounded
I was so up set, yet I have done my best!
When we went to Vietnam to try our luck!
I promised to bring Frank
back to Hong Kong
I kept my words!
I bring him home!
Ben are you out of your mind
When I saw him in Saigon
He was crazy, he lived like animal,
he led a dog's life!
You know why?.
Because he got a bullet in his head!
Why didn't you shoot straight?.
Now he has to suffer more?.
Is it worth it to kill a friend for a box of gold?.
There are dead people lying all over
the place in wartime
\You can bring back any bone
and said it belongs to Frank!
You want to get a revenge?. Damn it!
I never lose in my life...
They did not kill me in Vietnam,
you think you can scare me now?.
We are all fugitives in our lives,
see who run out of our luck first!
You're going to lose, Paul
Don't worry, I never lose in my life
Ben, we must die together
Frank, shut up
You bring it yourself, you are a dead man.
You dare follow me
You want to rest in peace. Let me help you
I'm going to take the box of gold! Do you envy?.
You don't have a long life to enjoy it
Let me help you to rest in peace
He said he wanted to rest in peace.
What shall we do?.
Give him one more shoot to help him
Come on, help your friend
Give him one more shoot! Shoot!
Give him one more shoot!
So that he can rest in peace!
And he can't follow us
Shoot, Ben! Help him to rest in peace!
Then we won't suffer anymore
I can continue to earn money
You can make some new friends
Shoot him!
