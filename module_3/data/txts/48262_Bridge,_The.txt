PREVIOUSLY
Helle Anker. I found traces of
chloroform in her airways and lungs.
Did someone take her heart?
Morten Anker. Three tours of the
Helmand province in Afghanistan.
They think it was me, but I...
I didn't hurt her. It was somebody else.
I have nothing against homosexuals.
But why should they marry in the Church?
I put that question to you,
Fabian Christensen.
His heart seems to be there.
- Have you been in the bedroom?
- All done.
- Did you see my necklace?
- I haven't seen it.
Stop following me around, or I'll report you.
- So you still think it was my fault?
- I know it was!
Hans Pettersson is missing.
We assume that he's not staying away
of his own free will.
EPISODE 3
The person you are trying
to reach is unavailable.
You can leave a message.
It's me again. Morten.
I don't know if you'll hear this, but...
I'll call back tomorrow at 10:00.
It would be great if you answered.
Who's there?
It's me again. Morten.
I don't know if you'll hear this...
I'll call back tomorrow at 10:00.
It would be great if you answered.
Why the hell didn't you answer?
How did you find me?
What's going on? Fuck!
Listen...
Last night,
Police Commissioner Hans Pettersson
was abducted by persons unknown.
We've received a video showing Hans alive,
and a demand for ransom.
If anyone was near the garage at
Vidungegatan 5 last night around 7:00 p.m.,
and may have witnessed something,
we ask them to come forward.
We will keep you updated.
Please respect our work
and Hans Pettersson's family.
- How big is the ransom demand?
- No comment.
- Do you have any suspects?
- No comment.
Had the police received any threats?
He wanted to give us money
but didn't have it.
Much of the money from the
security van heist was never found...
I don't know where he got the money,
but it was gone. But he had a plan.
- To kidnap Hans?
- He didn't say.
- But you think that might be it?
- I'm here, aren't I?
Yes.
Do you know where he might be?
There's a place he goes.
Is this it?
No. It's another place.
This is where Hans was.
- Someone set him free.
- Shot three times. Small impact area.
Chloroform.
Then someone else was also out to get Hans.
It seems like it.
Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
- Henrik, the forensics results.
- Thank you.
The toys and play food are
common brands found in all toy shops.
The clothes are from a big chain,
and they know the brand on the mannequins.
No traces of DNA or fingerprints
on Helle Anker.
But fingerprints on the door
of Fabian Christensen's car
that weren't his nor his wife's.
- Are you married?
- What did you say?
- Are you married?
- No. Are you?
Yes. Well, we divorced this spring,
and she moved back to Denmark.
It got a bit problematic
with Julia, our daughter.
- Yeah, that sounds difficult.
- Yeah...
The lipstick that was used
comes from a brand called FeliCity.
- Do you want to know why you're here?
- Yes, please.
When people find unnaturally large
quantities of blood in, say, a vehicle,
they normally ask questions.
You know what they usually ask?
No.
"What happened here?"
"Was someone hurt in there?"
"Whose blood is that?"
You only asked
when you could drive it again.
- I suppose I'm not very curious.
- Perhaps not.
FeliCity.
- What about it?
- You're on the board of FeliCity.
That's right.
You want to know why I brought it up?
As I said, I'm not a curious man.
Fabian Christensen and Helle Anker
had smileys drawn on their faces.
- In FeliCity lipstick.
- So what are you saying?
That I killed Helle Anker at my workplace,
and used makeup
from the company whose board I'm on?
- Wouldn't that be kind of stupid?
- Maybe.
But sometimes murderers are cocky.
They think they're better than the police.
They're convinced they'll never get caught.
But what do I know? I don't know you.
Maybe you're just stupid.
The Danish police responded to the call,
but they couldn't ID the victim.
But he had your business card.
You said that on the phone.
Do you know who found him?
A homeless person. The emergency
operator may have a name. He's in here.
- That's Morten Anker.
- Morten Anker?
Did he say anything?
No, he never regained consciousness.
- How many shots?
- Three. All in the chest.
- What are you doing?
- I need to see the injuries.
Three shots, same pattern.
So it's the same person who shot Dover?
- Possibly.
- And the perpetrator now has Hans?
Helle Anker also had traces of chloroform
in her airways.
It can't be a coincidence.
I want to take over Morten Anker's
murder from the Danish police.
Have forensics prioritise these two.
I want to be sure it was the same gun.
We'll proceed as if all murders
are linked to Hans' abduction.
Take Henrik with you
and continue this line of investigation.
Over there.
Peter Krogh?
Hello, I am Henrik Sabroe,
Copenhagen police.
- This is Saga Norén.
- Malmö CID.
How is he?
He died. Did you see who shot him?
I heard someone run, but saw nothing.
- Did you know him well?
- Not at all. He hadn't been here long.
- I didn't even know his name.
- His name was Morten Anker.
I see... So then you know who his brother is?
- His brother?
- That's who shot him.
That's what he said.
"My brother shot me. My brother shot me."
- He doesn't have a brother.
- He's got Elias.
- Elias is four.
- I don't think he did it.
- But Morten's got a brother, I mean.
- Elias is his half-brother.
- I know that, Wiki, but...
- Don't call me that.
Sometimes people call
their half-siblings their siblings.
Maybe Morten had more half-siblings,
that's what I meant.
- Why didn't you say so?
- I tried.
Then I had to convince you I didn't think
a four-year-old had shot two people
in two countries in 24 hours.
- It sounded like you thought that.
- It didn't.
Yes.
I'm all in.
Full house.
Two pairs.
Or...
A better full house.
- Hi, you're home?
- Yeah.
- It's kicking like crazy. You want to feel it?
- No, I'm OK.
I didn't hear you coming.
Where have you been?
Just out. Here and there.
- Doing what?
- Nothing in particular.
Doing what?
How much did you lose?
Bloody hell, Marc!
- The payment on the house is due today!
- Is that today?
Yes, it was today! 20,000 kroner
before 6:00 p.m. Jesus!
I'm sorry.
Did Morten have a brother?
Only Elias. Why?
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
- How can you be so sure?
- Because I am.
Villy couldn't have had any
before or after Helle?
They were together until he died, so no.
Morten was his only child.
Was Helle a lesbian or bisexual?
If she was a lesbian,
their sex life may have suffered.
And Villy may have cheated on her
and had a child.
If so, Helle knew nothing about it.
Does the name Aleksander Dover
mean anything to you?
- No, sorry.
- What about Hans Pettersson?
- He's a Swedish policeman.
- No.
It's John. Nothing in any register
that Villy had any children other
than Morten in Denmark or elsewhere.
If he had, Helle would probably not
have known. Nor would Morten.
There was that small box of photos in
Morten's trailer. Don't you remember?
Under the fridge by the cupboard.
Where the typewriter was.
Here it is.
Here he is with his mother.
He isolated himself from his family.
What happened?
- Maybe he didn't like his family.
- It doesn't look that way.
You can't assume they liked each other
because they're smiling in a picture.
Look at this.
- It's from Afghanistan.
- Look at the back.
"Kill brothers"?
Morten, with Kevin Larsen
and Lukas Stenstrup.
All three were accused of rape
and were tortured for it.
Kevin is dead. Lukas is alive.
- How did Kevin die?
- Suicide, just over two years ago.
- And Lukas Stenstrup?
- He's doing better.
He runs a project in Copenhagen
that helps young people.
With work, studies
and dealing with authorities.
Lukas Stenstrup? Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
This is Henrik Sabroe, Copenhagen police.
It's about Morten Anker.
- Should I take them inside?
- Yes.
- What's this about Morten?
- He's dead. Killed.
When did you last see Morten?
A long time ago.
Last year, I think.
He got too strange for me.
Where were you this morning at 8:00?
I was eating breakfast with my girlfriend.
And since then I've been here.
Could I have your girlfriend's
phone number?
Here you are.
Why did you ask where I was?
Morten said his brother had shot him.
- Morten didn't have a brother.
- He had kill brothers.
- Are you pulling my leg?
- If he didn't mean you, then who?
No idea.
- Haven't I seen you before?
- I don't think so.
- I remember faces. I have seen you.
- So do I, and I've never seen you.
- She corroborated his story.
- Keep your phone on and stay in town.
I'm not going anywhere.
- I'm done, so I'm going now.
- OK, thanks.
I folded up some clean laundry
I found in the bedroom.
- No need.
- I had time.
Yes, but in the future we'll do that ourselves.
- OK.
- OK.
- See you.
- Bye!
Excuse me. This was outside the door.
Thanks.
You know, our new CEO is allowed to smile...
Better. But with more warmth,
without losing your power...
- For God's sake, you were a model!
- Twenty years ago, Mum!
Yes, yes, but people remember you.
That's what we're taking advantage of.
Let's see... That's better than I thought.
We can use that.
And this one where she's standing tall.
These will do. Now for some family shots.
- Is that necessary?
- We're a family business.
- Building for other families. Empathy.
- Haven't you got what you need?
Don't you have guests coming?
It would be nice if you're home
when they arrive.
Håkan? Can you come in now? There...
Come over here and stand next to Anna.
And you can stand here.
Yeah! Look how cute.
- When does it become official?
- That I take over the company?
Some time next week, I think.
"The third generation of home builders."
- I'm getting a cola.
- Congratulate Anna.
- On what?
- She's the new CEO of Ekdahl's Housing.
Congratulations. Will your Russian
builders be able to get organised now?
- Benjamin...
- We have no policy against unions.
You don't need official policies when
you have unofficial threats and harassment.
I'll look into it, I promise.
- I'm so sorry! He's...
- Seventeen and politically active.
Maybe we can talk about something
other than the company at dinner.
Cheers!
Hi, Marc! Been shopping on credit?
- Or do you have money?
- I'm going to pay it all back...
Sounds good. Let's go.
- I can't pay it all now.
- I'm not the one you have to tell.
Shall I take that?
Hi, Marc. Have a seat.
So...
You owe me 78,000 kroner.
- If I could get an extra week...
- Shut up!
You don't "get" shit in life. You earn it.
Let's play a game.
Russian roulette.
Every time this .38 goes "click",
you get an extra day. There you are.
- Just one week...
- Shut up. Shut up and shoot!
Put the gun to your head
and pull the trigger, understand?
No.
You think I'm fucking kidding?
Put the gun to your head and pull the trigger!
Look me in the eye.
Do I look like I'm lying? Come on, then!
Take the gun and shoot! Shoot!
Do you think I'm fucking kidding? Shoot!
Pull the trigger!
There you go. That's one day.
Look at me. Jesus, you're a poker player.
Before, you had an 83.3% chance.
Now you have 69.4. Those are great odds.
Can you do it?
Can you get the money in one day?
Go on, Marc. Shoot.
Pull it. Come on, Marc! Go for it!
Fuck!
Now you have two days. Can you do it?
That's 39,000 a day. Can you do it?
Can you?
A piece of advice, buy yourself as many
fucking days as you can. Fire again.
Fire again! Shoot!
Shoot now!
I'll be damned!
Good, Marc.
Look, you idiot.
They're blanks. As if I could be bothered
to spend money on killing you.
You've got two days. Piss off.
We can't find any link
between the murders. Nothing.
No one's found Helle Anker's car.
What are you doing?
Going through the report on Kevin.
There's nothing to indicate
it's anything but suicide.
- Are you thinking of Hans?
- No, I'm thinking of Kevin Larsen.
- How did you get in?
- I told the receptionist who I am.
- That shouldn't be enough.
- Most people want to see their mums.
Come.
Give me a cup of coffee.
This missing police officer,
do you know him?
- He's my boss. And my friend.
- So you have a friend? How nice.
And thank you.
Did you show the medical records
I gave you to a doctor or something?
Yes.
Did they prove that I hurt your sister?
- No, but it couldn't be ruled out.
- So I still have to prove my innocence
instead of you proving my guilt?
You were wrong, Saga. Sit down.
Jennifer might still be alive
if we hadn't lost custody.
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm not here to accuse you.
I'm not after an apology.
But you must admit what you did to us
so that we can move on.
It's already too late for many things.
Your father died this morning.
Now it's just you and me, Saga.
There will be a memorial ceremony.
I hope you'll come to that at least.
You haven't always hated him.
Sorry to interrupt,
but they've found Helle Anker's car.
Oh, shit...
- It's a heart.
- Do you think it's Helle Anker's?
- It could be.
- What does it say?
It's a ticket for the ghost train.
What the hell does he want?
Let's go.
It's Hans!
Call an ambulance! He's still got a pulse!
Officer down!
Send an ambulance to Dyrehavsbakken!
And fucking hurry up!
Where are you going? No. No, let's go back.
- I have to work.
- Forensics are here.
- Maybe they'll miss something.
- They won't. It's under control, Saga.
There's nothing more you can do.
Come on, I'll drive you back.
No, I'll drive.
Saga? Come with me, please.
Marc?
Where have you been?
What have you done?
That's why I was gambling. To try to get
some money one way or another.
- Sorry, I love you.
- I know! And I love you!
But you're so bloody stupid sometimes!
I have two days.
Two days? To get hold of 78,000?
How do we get that? We can't just get a loan!
No. But I'll think of something.
No, you won't. Not this time.
- How are you now?
- Fine. I'll replace the things I broke.
Don't worry about it.
Are you OK to work on this inquiry?
Yes. Why wouldn't I be?
- You seem a bit unbalanced.
- Now?
No, not now, but before.
That was a reaction to finding Hans,
combined with prior news of a death.
- Who was that? Who has died?
- My father.
- I'm sorry...
- We weren't close.
But still. Such emotions
can affect your police work.
My emotions never affect my work.
Hans expects me to find whoever did this.
- Because you're friends?
- No, because I'm the best he's got.
What's this?
It came today.
Some nutter.
It's nothing new.
Fabian Christensen.
- Have you shown this to the police?
- Not yet.
What are you waiting for?
They'll think they're right!
I'm not responsible, but I'm involved.
You're not involved, you're a victim.
This is sick.
It won't be seen that way.
They say that I incite crime!
I don't care how people will see it.
- I was at the police station today.
- Why?
They think I'm involved somehow.
If they find out you had this
and didn't tell them, it won't look good.
- Lise...
- It's my reputation, my decision.
Hello.
He's lost a hand and a lot of blood
and he's in a coma.
- I just wanted to know how he was.
- Saga...
- I don't want to be alone right now.
- Why don't you call someone?
Would you please stay a while?
You're his friend. You care about him.
How long have you been sitting here?
A few hours.
I woke up. I don't know why.
The pills usually do the trick so I thought
maybe my subconscious
had come up with something.
Henrik...
I know you think I should drop it, but I can't.
Once. They only questioned him once.
I thought you'd ask
your new colleague for help.
Yeah...
- Go, or you'll be late for work.
- Yeah...
Yes, you're right.
You're right.
Lukas?
If you kill him, you'll never get your money.
So let's come up with another solution.
One you can both benefit from.
Or, he doesn't have to gain anything,
but you'll leave him alone...
Some kind of payment plan.
Say something!
Tell me what we can do to pay off the debt!
You've got balls.
More so than your boyfriend.
I don't have a choice.
There is something you could help me with.
Forensics haven't found anything
where Hans was discovered.
It was staged. Just like with Christensen
and Anker, we were meant to find him.
The bullets that killed Anker and Dover
came from the same gun.
We think the primary targets were
Helle Anker, Fabian Christensen and Hans.
Dover got in the way when he took Hans.
Morten must have been a threat, too.
But there must be a link
between Helle, Fabian and Hans.
There is one.
Yes, I wrote about Hans Pettersson
when he criticised me and my opinions.
But you've already looked into that.
Nothing has changed.
Two links to you could be a coincidence.
Three is a pattern.
What do you know about this, Lars?
I don't know anything.
Or I know what Lise knows.
And Lise, and therefore both of you,
knows more than we do. Right?
I received a letter.
He writes, "I've gone from words
to actions to show my appreciation.
"Not everyone understands,
but I know you do.
"I'm doing this for you.
It would mean a lot to me
"if you'd give me a sign
to show you appreciate my work.
"Guide me. Who should I go for next time?"
Typed, with a picture of Christensen
taken at the scene.
- It was outside her door.
- And she doesn't know who wrote it?
But I think there's a way to find out.
Five Danish soldiers.
Five young Danes died in Afghanistan
under Bente Knudsen's command.
It's not her fault that we send young men
to die in never-ending wars abroad.
I'll never understand
how Afghanistan's cause became ours.
But if our men go
to defend freedom and democracy,
they'd better not end up
under Bente Knudsen's command.
Tomorrow she's leaving
on a new NATO mission.
With more young Danish men.
Their greatest chance of survival is
if Bente Knudsen doesn't go with them.
I received a letter. A real letter
that made me very happy and grateful.
The letter also contained a question,
which I believe I have answered now.
- Post that at exactly 1700 hours today.
- You think he'll go after Knudsen?
The letter writer wanted a target.
You've given him a target and a time frame.
At 5:00, everyone should be invisible.
I repeat, at 5:00 everyone is invisible.
That was good. She really
emphasised that he has to act tonight.
- Where do you want us?
- On the side street.
Saga, not you.
- I don't want you here at all.
- Why not?
If we're lucky, the person who hurt Hans
will show up, and I don't want you here.
- You think I'd do something?
- I think there's clearly a risk.
- I have extreme impulse control.
- This isn't negotiable, Saga.
...and the hospital ward will be closed
for the foreseeable future.
The death of Helle Anker creates
uncertainty for her new pre-school.
But her financiers have given the green light.
Natalie Anker today stated...
Yes, I will be taking over the pre-school
that Helle started.
I'm still in shock over my wife's death,
but violence will never silence me.
Hi. Are you ready?
- Did you win?
- Of course.
- Let's get sushi and pick up Viola.
- I can't, dear. I'm nowhere near done.
- Come on, you can delegate.
- To whom?
Go on. I'll be along in an hour or so.
- OK. See you later.
- Bye!
Have I made up for yesterday?
You know,
I'm going to take a look at that thing...
The thing you were talking about. For you.
How many people have seen it now?
1,823 people.
How many have viewed it now?
Another three. 1,826.
Still nothing. No suspect has appeared.
- Saga, I think I've got something.
- What?
I ran a comparative analysis between
Lise's letter and comments on her blog.
Ninety-eight comments by "Knightrider"
over a long period.
In 21 of them he used the word "guide".
That was in the letters both Helle
and Lise received. Check "enlighten".
- Nineteen times.
- It was in Helle's and Fabian's letters.
- Neither word is that common.
- Do you know who Knightrider is?
Let's see...
John got a hit in Lise's comments field.
Rikard Johnsson, Ringstedsgade 21.
- Ten minutes away. Where are you?
- I'm leaving the police station now.
I'm on my way. See you soon.
Yes, I will be taking over the pre-school
that Helle started.
I'm still in shock over my wife's death,
but violence will never silence me.
- Saga Norén, Malmö CID.
- Where are you?
- I'm almost there.
- Natalie Anker is the next victim!
I'm calling for back-up.
Please, no, no!
Let me go! No!
Drop the knife. Drop the knife!
Stop!
Stop!
- Elias!
- He's asleep.
