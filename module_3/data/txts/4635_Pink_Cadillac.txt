Hello. ls this Randy Bates?
Who wants to know?
This is Crazy CarI Cummings.
KZTS aII-hits radio station.
Pride of the nation at 98.9.
We've got a surprise for you just about
as big as Barry Manilow's beak.
Are you sitting down?
Better yet, are you Iaying down?
Are you on a waterbed, aII comfy?
Are you horizontaI, Randy boy?
No, I'm sitting up,
but I think I can handIe it.
Do you Iike country music?
I used to Iike Roy Acuff.
Roy Acuff? WouId you take DoIIy Parton
in a pinch?
I may be Crazy CarI, but I wouId.
But you won it.
You won the KZTS phone-home prize.:
An evening with DoIIy Parton.
The evening begins with a pre-show dinner
for you and Miss Parton...
at the Hawaii Kai Room
of the Sheraton Barstow.
A backstage pass for you for DoIIy's
big show at the Barstow War MemoriaI...
and then, a IittIe dessert
at Massimino's Cafe.
And who knows whether
the evening wiII end there?
Because, DoIIy, she's a powerfuI woman.
She's been on the road a Iong, Iong time.
AII right.
-What's your favorite radio station?
-KZTS.
I can't hear you.
We'II pick you up at 6:00
in a Iong bIack Iimousine, baby.
Yeah, aII right.
DoIIy Parton? You turned a hard-core feIon
into a trembIing teenager.
What kind of indictment
did this guy skip out on?
Two counts of atrocious assauIt.
He found his wife in bed with a roadie
from ZZ Top and took a tire iron to both.
You must be awfuI tired,
you had a Iong drive to get here.
That's my job,
track them and snatch them.
I can't beIieve this guy is sitting there
expecting a Iimousine.
Good evening, sir. CongratuIations.
Goddamn, I never won anything before.
AIIow me.
I am ready to party hard.
I'm Tom Nowak. I've been empowered
by the State of CaIifornia...
to return you to Sacramento
where you're due to stand triaI.
You son of a bitch!
You son of a bitch!
What's your favorite radio station, Randy?
K-Suck, you dork!
Once we catch them, we never gIoat.
Thank you, gents.
What kind of music do you Iike?
I sure as heII don't want to hear
no Roy Acuff, I'II teII you that.
Matter of fact...
I'd Iike to hear something
that sounds about as mean as I feeI.
Why don't you just Iet me
pick it for you, then?
A Crazy CarI Cummings speciaI.
john Capshaw from Sacramento.
He's got a good start,
and Rampage is a tough one to ride.
lt looks like he'll get big money
out of this rodeo.
Capshaw has gone down,
and the rodeo clowns move in.
Here's what clowns are all about...
as the bull takes it out on the barrel.
Thanks, partner.
Nice ride, cowboy.
Tom, how are you doing?
Say, my favorite bIoodhound.
I just did John Capshaw and I couId
sure use the cash now, if you got it.
-You did Capshaw?
-How?
I'II teII you Iater. You got the money?
We're just ordering. Sit down.
You got to eat, for Christ's sake.
I'II have the Chief Justice Warren Burger,
weII done.
Extra fries.
One Warren, burn it.
Have you got the money?
I got to visit someone.
You got to visit somebody?
Isn't that funny?
I never thought of Tommy Nowak
as the kind of guy who pays a sociaI caII.
Have you got the money?
AII right.
Thanks.
TeII us how you did Capshaw.
He tricked the poor bastard.
That's what he did.
He snuck up
when the dude was haIf unconscious.
-Who are you?
-I'm Capshaw's Iawyer, okay?
I'II teII you this...
there's a pretty thin Iine between
what you do and what some outIaws do.
Maybe a thin Iine, but it ain't invisibIe.
-Afternoon, Miss McGuinn.
-Afternoon, Mr. Barton.
When you going to take some sun?
You're about the paIest thing
in the whoIe damn camp.
One of these days, Mr. Barton.
Remember when I gave you
our rent money on the first of the month...
-right on time?
-Remember?
It's a goIden day in my book of memories.
First time since you and your husband
came here...
when you actuaIIy paid when it was due.
Can I have it back?
You're a reaIIy nice person, Mr. Barton.
Isn't he?
Hi, honey.
What's up?
Hi, honey.
-What's that?
-Leave that aIone.
That's baby food money, Roy.
Not for shotguns, not for WiId Turkey.
Not so you can get wasted
on some kind of horse tranquiIizer.
You're with me on that, right?
Do you hear, boys?
This is baby food money.
$120.
WouId you heIp me with the baby?
Say, hey, Roy.
-We finaIIy got it knocked, baby.
-Knocked?
Like that Amway franchise in the desert?
Or the oiI fieId work in AIaska?
Or how about our famous
chinchiIIa farm, remember?
Make cash fast by raising chinchiIIas
for their peIts...
unIess you Ieave the cage door open
and they run away.
I know I screwed up a Iot of things...
but honest, we're on Dream Street now.
Come on.
How'd you make this money?
We didn't make it.
Some friends of ours did.
-It's counterfeit?
-State of the art, baby.
This is the big time.
Listen to me.
You do six months for seIIing hot VCRs,
I'm stiII here when you get out.
I waited for you.
But I didn't count on these prison buddies.
PIease, for the baby's sake,
get rid of these psychos.
They scare me.
Psychos? These guys?
Let me keep the money here a few days.
I'II find a good hiding pIace for it.
I know I screwed up
some things in the past...
but this is idiot-proof.
Doesn't it seem just a IittIe strange
that this woman...
who has no previous record at aII...
is the onIy person being indicted
for possession of counterfeit money?
Your Honor, she was the onIy one home
at the time of the raid.
And she refuses to teII us
anything about the crime.
One couId hardIy bIame
the woman, Mr. Hastings...
when she's got a FoIsom Prison
cIass reunion...
going on right behind her.
If Your Honor pIeases, these gentIemen
have come to post bond for the defendant.
We beIieve that the counterfeit money
we found in that traiIer...
is just the tip of the iceberg.
There are other moneys...
and other crimes invoIved.
So we ask the court...
to set the bond with these facts in mind.
The court sets baiI at $25,000.
We can cover that action, baby.
Your Honor, Mrs. McGuinn
prefers to seek baiI...
from a recognized baiI bondsman.
What do you got for me, Buddy?
I toId you. I got LittIe WaIter Drucker.
The schmuck who gave me
this defective microwave for coIIateraI.
He is sitting downtown
at the GoIden Bear MoteI...
waiting to be pIucked
Iike an appIe on a tree.
Why don't you Iet
one of the kids handIe him?
There's no fun
in the WaIter Druckers of the worId.
Fun?
Mr. Bring-them-back-aIive
wants a big fun-fix.
If I may quote
the immortaI OIivia Newton-John:
''Have you never been meIIow?''
I know what you can do.
You can fiII out miIeage reports.
Justify aII the money
I am giving you for gasoIine.
WiII you do that for me?
I asked you a question.
And I didn't give you an answer.
So, you can do WaIter Drucker.
''HeII, no. That's no fun.''
You couId fiII out miIeage reports.
''HeII, no. That's too much Iike a reaI job.''
You can jump on Mary EIIen Chesbro:
The beautifuI court stenographer who's
been mooning over you for two years.
''HeII, no. She might get her hooks in me.''
Come on, Tommy!
Do WaIter Drucker.
For once in your Iife, be reasonabIe.
I tried that once. I didn't Iike it.
How's that baby?
I had to Ieave her with my sister
over in Nevada.
Sure was sorry to hear about the arrest.
Are they gonna take the baby away?
I mean, after they find you guiIty and aII?
I don't know, Mr. Barton.
Sure is a fine machine.
Every boy's dream. A pink CadiIIac.
You know what EIvis said.
Roy never drove this thing.
Never even had the top down.
And you ask me
why I never get any sun on my face.
I don't mean to interfere...
in your marriage...
but it's dangerous
messing around with a man's vehicIes.
You're right about that, Mr. Barton.
Very right.
Come back here, damn it!
What are you going to do now?
Or you can expIain it to AIex.
He'II pass judgment.
Yeah, okay.
But I'm worn out.
Don't you have any speed?
Diet piIIs? What the heII am I supposed
to do with supermarket diet piIIs?
You can gobbIe the whoIe box
as far as I'm concerned.
I'm not gonna waste good crystaI
on you now.
Maybe if you find Lou Ann.
HeII of an escape, Lou Ann.
You are about the paIest thing.
Obviously a hardened criminal.
I can teII by the Kewpie bow Iips.
Who cares about her Iips? She waIked out
on a bond of $25,000. She's a fugitive.
You want her or not?
For me it's aII the same.
I want her. You got a priors on her?
Her oId man has aII the priors,
but I didn't post bond for the oId man.
Did they run together by any chance?
ActuaIIy, you might have competition
from the hubby.
She's more scared of him
than she is of the Iaw.
Why's that?
He's invoIved with that gang of ex-cons,
you know, the Birthright.
Birthright?
No, Buddy. I want you to understand me.
Watch the rhythmic movement
of my Iips as I teII you...
-I'm not going to take this assignment.
-Come on, I need you.
Do you know what I was saying
to somebody yesterday?
I swear I said, ''Tommy Nowak...
''he can track down a shadow
in the middIe of the night.''
I happen to track fugitives, Buddy.
I don't go around after whacked-out
ex-cons that carry automatic weapons.
But I bet those guys
from the Birthright are saying:
''Let's waste this broad
before she turns state's evidence.''
I mean, it probabIy
is the first time in your Iife...
that you can serve the cause of justice.
Yeah.
What? I happen to Iove our IegaI system.
As Iong as it keeps you
in diamonds and Sonys.
You're saving her by catching her.
So, where are you going to start Iooking?
It says here she's got a sister
that Iives out near Reno.
-Reno?
-Might as weII start there.
But watch the miIeage, wouId you?
Stay cIear of the Birthright!
Speed and wine!
Give me some of that stuff.
I want that stuff that kiIIed Hank WiIIiams,
I just don't want quite that much.
What are you yeIIing for, Roy?
Do you think you've earned the right
to have a good time?
No.
What's your probIem, Roy?
No probIem, AIex.
TeII me.
I don't....
I don't Iike--
''I don't Iike seeing Lou Ann out there
in SiIhouette City.''
I aIways know
what you're thinking, don't I?
Yeah.
Go ahead. Take it down.
Go ahead.
Stop!
Turn around.
Do you trust me?
Yes, sir.
Go stand in your wife's picture.
Now, here's the point.
I need at Ieast a dozen more
fuII automatic weapons...
to start buiIding the arsenaI of my dreams.
The arsenaI of our dreams.
Yeah.
But our weapons budget,
our communications budget...
just about our whoIe budget
is driving around in the desert...
with your wife.
Now, are you man enough
to go get it back?
-Yes, sir, I am.
-Good.
I thought so.
Waycross, why don't you go heIp him out?
-What shouId I do about--
-The femaIe?
Use your best judgment.
Look at this gorgeous girI.
If this cash was genuine, I'd have
your Harvard education aII paid for.
$253,000.
That'd just about do it.
This sure does Iook reaI.
Why don't you cut Ioose this one time?
Take this pIay money into Reno
and give yourseIf a weekend on the town.
What are you taIking about?
I just got here.
Lou Ann, honey, you're a fugitive.
We figured, if anybody comes after you,
this might be their first stop.
It's best we scatter for a whiIe
untiI this thing bIows over.
We'II take the baby to my foIks' house.
She'II be safe there.
You just go on in to Reno.
Have yourseIf a good time.
And get some sun whiIe you're at it.
Bye, baby. I Iove you. Yes.
-Everything's gonna be aII right.
-We'II see you in a coupIe of days.
Bye.
Bye, honey. I Iove you. Don't forget me.
You seen a bIonde in a pink CadiIIac?
OnIy in my dreams.
Pack them.
Aren't you gonna treat yourseIf
to some new cIothes?
We mustn't Iet our babies
get more gIamorous than us.
Maybe just one dress.
Ring these up.
I'm going to show her to Iadies' wear.
-And the shoe department.
-Good.
I'II go! Give me the dice whiIe I'm hot.
Let's go again.
Coming up. Eight!
-Okay, give me the dice.
-Your skin is soft.
FeIIow, Ieave the Iady aIone.
Leave me aIone whiIe I'm hoIding the dice.
Give me those dice. Okay!
You can't do it.
I'm going to doubIe it!
Seven, out.
Oh, no. I Iost.
Your skin...
it is so soft. Like VeIveeta.
You know VeIveeta?
Yeah. You think my skin
Iooks Iike processed cheese.
May I see you for a moment?
Right this way. Thank you.
Sit down over here, Mrs. McGuinn.
Somebody got you some nice threads,
didn't they?
Recognize this woman?
She Iooks famiIiar.
Like someone who never reaIIy
got a break.
Someone who might go crazy for a day.
I wouIdn't judge her.
You're a cop?
Not exactIy.
What do you mean, not exactIy?
Who the heII are you?
I'm a skip tracer.
I work for the baiI bondsman
who put up your bond.
Why didn't you have your husband
and his friends put up the money?
If you're taking me back, Iet's get going.
I can't take much more
of this EIvis tribute.
If you don't mind me saying,
you Iook dressed to kiII tonight.
I'm dressed to torture, kiIIing's too good.
CouId you hoId that a second?
My purse!
You creep! Just give me back my--
Thanks.
I got a warrant for that woman.
Here's fine.
Didn't think anyone
couId run that fast in heeIs.
Tina Turner taught me.
Look, mister, I got an 8-month-oId baby--
I don't even want to hear about it.
I'm just a deIivery boy.
Where are the handcuffs?
You're not gonna handcuff me? Aren't you
into the whoIe bondage part of the job?
Lady, I don't even Iike starch in my coIIars.
You wouIdn't take baiI money
from the Birthright...
but you managed to spend some
of that counterfeit cash around town.
It's not so compIicated.
I had the whoIe thing figured out.
It's for my daughter.
I was going to take a IittIe bit
of the make-beIieve money...
and win a Iot of the reaI money...
at the tabIes.
It's dumb.
It sounds Iike
one of my husband's great ideas.
He sounds reaIIy swift.
How'd you get tied up with him
in the first pIace?
BeIieve it or not, Roy was the cooIest boy
in San Bernardino...
about 40,000 Heinekens ago.
He said I was marrying James Dean.
I ended up with an amphetamine junkie.
You don't know how many women I taIk to
who teII the same story.
Look...
I have $250,000
of very high-quaIity counterfeit cash--
Forget it. I wouIdn't take it if it was reaI.
Shut up and Iisten to me.
I didn't mean it that way.
-You didn't?
-I didn't mean it that way.
I thought that if I gave the money
to the cops, they might go easy on me.
We couId go back and pick it up.
HeIping you with your IegaI case
is absoIuteIy none of my business.
My job is just to foIIow you, find you...
and FederaI Express you back home.
The three F's?
I couId use a IittIe heIp.
This is so wrong.
Stand aside.
It makes a reaIIy good hiding pIace.
It kind of reminds you of going
to the drive-in movie, doesn't it?
Parking in the woods...
Iistening to the crickets off in the distance.
-The howIing of the woIves....
-WiII you shut up?
The baying of the dogs.
You just have to pIay
that IittIe-girI-Iost routine, don't you?
''I'm just a fugitive feIon.
''That doesn't mean I'm not feminine.
''I just need a strong man to heIp me.
''I guess that makes me
Iike a Cosmo fugitive.''
Buddy. Look, I asked you for a favor.
You said okay.
You don't have to go making fun of me.
I'm through taking shit from men.
That's one thing we have in common.
Because I'm through
taking shit from men, too.
It's a IittIe Iate
to try to head out to Sacramento now.
Come on in. Make yourseIf comfortabIe.
Those are gone.
Put your sack down. Take a Ioad off.
Buddy? It's me, in Reno.
I haven't found her yet.
I've got the scent, though.
I'II probabIy find her tomorrow
or the next day.
WiII you forget about the miIeage?
I'm tired of taIking about miIeage.
I'II caII you in the morning
no matter what happens.
Why did you Iie?
It just seemed easier
than expIaining things.
WouId you care for something
from our compIimentary mini-bar?
Yeah.
I forgot that's the way it is
with these joints.
They get you haIf in the bag,
and you forget how to pIay the game.
Maybe one Cuervo. Just a short one.
We'II keep the drapes open,
so it won't get too dark in here.
What's the matter? Are you nervous?
Are your paIms aII sweaty?
Can you heIp me with my zipper?
Thanks.
Going somewhere?
I was just getting a gIass of water.
I have a IittIe gas.
FeeI good?
Thank you.
Look at these IittIe jeIIies.
No, it's mine.
It's mine. That's for the biII.
That's for you.
-Thank you.
-You're weIcome.
I'm a big tipper.
-Let's Iook at some of this pIay dough.
-No.
I have had no troubIe
spending any of that money.
-I can see why. It's reaI.
-It can't be.
It's reaI.
-How do you know?
-I just know.
I think these guys
must have come across...
high-grade counterfeit money. They've
been exchanging it for the reaI stuff.
The money in your traiIer
was probabIy the Iast of the fake stuff.
This is Grade A, U.S. Government green.
You mean...
I've been running around...
with $250,000...
in reaI money?
Yep.
Birthright money?
Oh, God.
What's going to happen to me?
What's going to happen to my baby?
I've got a job to do.
We better hit the road.
America for Americans!
Did you get the femaIe?
What about the money?
You two have put me
on a very Iow-budget IeveI.
Now, I tried to have some pamphIets
made up cheapIy.
Waycross, why don't you come up here
and take a Iook at this?
''Niggers,'' bIah, bIah, bIah....
''Spics, gooks taking our jobs.''
BIah, bIah, bIah.
''Conspiracy of the Jews.''
-It's not very good.
-Why don't you teII everyone why?
WeII, first of aII, the printing stinks.
I mean, ''niggers'' is aII bIurred...
and now and here you got ''Jews''
running off into the margin.
You got that right.
-You think that's funny?
-I mean....
Imagine...
trying to recruit new members
with amateurish crap Iike this.
There's no way, AIex.
You are going to SiIhouette City.
AII right!
He's a warrior.
Good.
Now I feeI some unity.
Now I feeI some power.
Not just a bunch of smaII-time car thieves,
penny ante codeine junkies...
wife beaters,
drifters without a cIue in this worId...
but warriors.
Ready to seize everything
that's been denied them.
Why don't you go back
to that sister's house and wait?
I guarantee you, within five days
we wiII have aII our money back.
And we wiII deaI with the femaIe.
You see that? That's God.
God caused that fIat tire.
He doesn't want you to take me back.
-God's into bIowing tires now?
-Yes.
I'm just asking for two more days.
We can go to my sister's house
and I can see my baby again.
Don't you know
I've aIready gone cIinicaIIy insane?
Taking you back here to get the money,
interfering with your case.
Ever since I met you,
I've been breaking the Iaw.
What the heII is the Iaw anyway?
The same peopIe who make the Iaw,
break the Iaw every day.
I am not taIking about their Iaw,
I am taIking about my Iaw.
Fine!
Then foIIow your own Iaw.
What do you mean the trail went cold?
Tom, you're too good.
I'm having serious troubIe with this.
Wait, don't hang up. AII right.
Since you've driven aII the way to Reno,
Nevada, you might as weII do Jack Bass.
We got a tip that he's been
hanging around Harrah's IateIy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Wait, Tom.
Do you know what
cherchez la femme means?
It's French for dig up the broad,
aIready. Okay?
I've aIways admired your way
with a ContinentaI phrase.
I've got a new case. A reaI mean dude.
What the heII am I going to do with you?
Take me aIong. Maybe I can heIp.
Oh, God. Give me a break.
Too much raw dude for you, babe?
I can dig it.
If my Iife were a movie,
there'd be a sign on it saying:
''Caution: some scenes too intense
for younger viewers.''
Okay.
Let's say this act of yours works
and you catch this Bass character.
-We catch this bastard, doII face.
-Yeah.
We catch him. What did he do, anyhow?
He stabbed a deaIer down in Vegas.
Imagined he was cheating him,
and went crazy with a 10-inch bIade.
Where are we gonna try and catch him?
I hear he's been hanging around Harrah's
the Iast few nights.
What'II you do when you catch him?
I'm gonna apprehend him.
Turn him over to the IocaI authorities.
Without getting to know
anything about him.
Nothing about his personaI Iife.
I don't want to know about his brother,
his mother, his sister...
I don't want to know
about the famiIy pets...
the pet parakeet, the dog, the cat.
I don't want to know diddIy-shit.
Wait for my signaI.
And remember your Iine.
HeIIo, Jack. I'm Miss Reno Casino.
This is where you want to be. Big jackpot.
Big payoffs.
Come on in and try your Iuck.
This is where you want to be.
If you feeI Iucky,
this is where you want to pIay...
because the action never stops.
Come on in.
What do you think?
Looks Iike a penis, onIy smaIIer.
If you're feeIing Iucky,
this is the pIace to be.
Because the action never stops.
If you're hungry, step right up,
come in and try one of our restaurants.
This is it, foIks. This is the pIace
you want to be. Big payoffs.
Here he is, Mr. HassIeback.
Our one-miIIionth customer.
What a fine specimen of a man he is, too.
Yes, Mr. Lucky One MiIIion.
Sorry we don't have
a brass band for you, Mr....
-Jack Bass.
-Jack Bass.
No brass for Mr. Bass.
If you'II pardon the pun, sir.
May I caII you Jack?
You can caII me DaryI HassIeback.
I happen to be the vice-president
in charge of promotion of this casino.
Are you famiIiar with our operation?
Sure. Like Vic Damone...
-and AIan King.
-Yeah, Iike Vic.
Yeah, cooI, man.
We have 143 gaming tabIes
and 4 showrooms...
and the deIuxe hoteI.
And we got a fantastic gift for you.
Yeah, what?
WouId you beIieve
an aII-expense-paid weekend on me...
and $5,000 worth of chips?
Ladies and gentIemen,
move back and give Mr. Bass some room.
Move back. Can't you see the detective
is trying to make an arrest--
Get him !
I'II kiII you, you--
-My name is Tom Nowak.
-What?
I've been authorized to turn you over
to the IocaI authorities...
where you wiII be extradited.
Yeah! It's a contact sport!
What the heII happened to you?
You were supposed to show up
and pIay Miss Reno Casino...
-and give him a kiss.
-I didn't want to kiss him.
We both know
what I was reaIIy supposed to do.
I was supposed to show you
once and for aII if I'd run away.
-You showed me. You ran.
-I thought about it.
But when I saw you chasing him,
I came back.
We did Jack Bass!
-We're partners.
-Partners?
I don't even have a goddamn car anymore.
I don't have any partners.
Didn't anyone ever teII you,
you shouIdn't mess with a man's vehicIes?
Yeah, I think I heard that
somepIace before.
You want the goddamn car or not?
Yeah, I want it, for two days onIy.
One day to see your kid, and the other day
to get you to Sacramento.
Thanks.
You won't regret it.
I wonder.
I may be thick, but this sucks,
standing here waiting.
WeII, Roy, you are thick.
Just about as thick as a Texas steak.
My God, it's Roy.
It's Roy with some other guy.
What the heII did I do
with the goddamn .38?
Shit!
FeIIow here kind of misses his wife.
Where is she, Jeff?
You better teII us right now.
I swear we haven't seen her.
Come on now, Jeff.
You're my brother-in-Iaw.
FamiIy members shouId aIways be
truthfuI with each other.
He is teIIing you the truth!
Give me Royann.
Give me my own fIesh and bIood.
It's okay, honey. It's okay.
You know, Roy,
this kid's our ace in the hoIe.
Mothers aIways come back
for their young.
It's just a matter of time.
WouIdn't you say so, dear?
I don't know. It couId be a reaI Iong time.
We'II wait. I got pIenty of time.
So why did the first marriage break up?
First marriage was a joke.
I was never around.
This Iine of work,
you're aIways out on the road.
The second marriage....
I don't even want to touch that one.
I did get engaged to a girI
about three years ago.
ReaIIy?
So what happened?
Right after we got engaged...
she won the titIe of
Miss Aamco Transmission...
of TurIock, CaIifornia.
NaturaIIy, she'd date a guy...
who'd stand beside her
when she performed her queenIy duties...
Iike cutting the ribbon
at a new muffIer shop or something.
We both knew I wasn't that guy.
So you never reaIIy settIed down.
-I don't think--
-Let me guess. You're not the type.
You're an American wiIdcat.
Your kind can't breed in captivity.
The road is your onIy home.
I guess the road can get a IittIe oId
now and then.
Isn't that dangerous?
Putting that cocaine on that knife?
Cocaine?
Cocaine's for queers
with goId credit cards.
This here is amphetamine.
OnIy way to snort it
is off a hunting knife. Want some?
Cute IittIe girI, isn't she?
She's her dad's precious.
I'm not much for rug rats myseIf.
Just accidents waiting to happen.
Of course, this one's
worth its weight in goId, isn't it?
This one's going to bring home mama.
Mama and aII that precious money.
Roy, what are you going to do to Lou Ann?
We're gonna get the money
and the car back...
and then we're just gonna
put the fear of God into her.
Fear of God?
What good's the fear of God these days?
She took our hard-earned money.
She can naiI us.
I don't think the fear of God's
nearIy good enough.
A child of four could see
these envelopes are hermetically sealed.
They've been kept in a mayonnaise jar
since noon today.
If you couId just sit and taIk to AIex
for 10 minutes...
you'd understand why you have to Iive
in this crummy IittIe house.
How you got cheated of your birthright
and what you couId do to get it back.
This house is just fine with me.
I know what you stand for. My oId man
fought against it in WorId War II.
Maybe I shouId pop you right now.
My CadiIIac!
She's here.
-You recognize this car?
-It's Jeff and Dinah's. They're home.
This is my friend, Tom Nowak.
Hi, Tom, pIeased to meet you.
Why don't you both come in?
-Where's my IittIe baby?
-There she is.
Who's here? Look.
Show your mama
how you've been waIking.
Pumpkin, you can waIk!
Surprise!
-Roy, what's going on?
-Over there.
Maybe you better teII me what's going on.
Who's the new bodyguard?
He was sent to catch me.
Sure, you Iook reaI caught.
By the baiI bondsman, Roy.
Take your fiIthy hands off my chiId!
They say you can't put a vaIue on human
Iife. That's such absoIute buIIshit!
I can put a vaIue on this IittIe rug rat's Iife.
$253,000. Let's have it.
And the keys to my CadiIIac, too.
Here you go.
You had the nerve to drive my vehicIe?
I ought to--
The transmission's haIf-shot and it puIIs--
Fuck that CadiIIac! Where's the money?
It's right in the back where you Ieft it.
Go check it, Roy. If it's there, honk.
Wait for me outside. You understand?
Wait outside!
I've got some unfinished business
with this bitch.
You're gonna try to be a hero?
I'm a skip tracer. This isn't my fight.
Then shut up and sit down.
Get the kid!
No, Roy! You're not Iike them.
Roy, give me the baby!
Roy, no!
Come back!
Roy, come back with the baby!
That guy was good. I'II give him that.
''It's not my fight.''
You know what, darIing?
He Iied.
The night she was born...
I remember Iying on the tabIe
in the deIivery room.
Worrying.
Worrying about Roy.
Worrying about money.
Worrying about this baby.
She seemed to have two strikes
against her before she was even born.
Then, aII of a sudden, I just...
fIoated up to the ceiIing
of the deIivery room.
I hovered there...
Iooking down at myseIf.
And I saw how paIe and sweaty...
and worried I was, and I thought...
it's a shame she has to be so scared
aII her Iife.
Doesn't she know
everything's going to be aII right?
Because the reaI me...
was fIoating above it aII.
Then the ceiIing of the deIivery room
just opened up...
and I just kept rising up into the air...
untiI it feIt Iike aII the stars were passing
right through my body.
And then the baby came out.
We're going to get your baby back.
-I Iove you.
-Drive carefuIIy.
Bye.
AII right.
You wanna be partners, we'II be partners.
Open the gIove box.
I'm gonna give you your first Iesson
in skip tracing.
A subtIe, aImost diaboIicaIIy cIever way...
of obtaining documents
from Iocked pIaces.
That is cIever.
What does he have in here?
Roy aIways had a coupIe of those
phony IDs hanging around.
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Better than pretty good.
This couId fooI a trooper
in CaIifornia or Nevada.
This is a Ricky Z originaI.
We're headed west.
Who's Ricky Z?
AII right. Tommy Nowak!
How's the Iife force
treating you today, paI?
-AII right.
-Come on in.
I wanted to know if you remember
making this Iicense for a Roy HoIIyfieId?
Sure, boy!
I had to go into a trance on that one.
It's not funny, either.
This is the truth.
Dude came in here, he was aII shaky.
His partners were aII hostiIe...
so I just wanted to give him a name
to chiII him out.
So I went into my meditation routine.
And I came up with this name.
Roy HoIIyfieId.
Dude, you never introduced me
to your oId Iady yet.
You're the expert on make-beIieve,
you teII me.
I'd say GwendoIyn.
Or maybe Samantha.
But the way the worId runs,
your name's probabIy Bonnie Sue.
-CIose. Lou Ann.
-WeII, see...
some peopIe see names the way they are.
I see names the way they shouId be.
This HoIIyfieId Iicense,
and the guys he came in with....
Just a minute.
Let me create a new identity for you.
-I am on the Iam.
-It's cooI.
His running buddies.Can you teII me
about his running buddies?
Yeah. They were those dudes
from the Birthright.
They're cIients of mine.
-How couId you? Those guys are psycho.
-ChiII out, man.
They're just a bunch of screw-ups
who pIay with guns.
There's nothing more dangerous
than a screw-up with a .44.
Now concentrate, wiII you?
Whereabouts was their camp?
Give me a second. I'II concentrate for you.
I want you to sign your name.
Sign ''GwendoIyn de Ia Croix'' three times
in your most reIaxed handwriting.
Listen, Tommy, I may be out there,
but I'm not an idiot...
and don't ask me to rat on the Birthright.
She has a baby being heId by speed freaks
with automatic weapons.
Wow, man. That's heavy.
God! Don't Iay that on me, man.
I think I know where they are.
I think they're in the Sierras.
When they came in,
they were aII weirded out...
they were wired,
they were taIking Iike auctioneers.
One of them started caIIing me a hippie.
Trying to mess with my mind.
But I Iet them taIk
because my mind is unmessabIe.
AbsoIuteIy.
AII right. So then they said...
there was a hippie commune
on the other side of their camp...
over near Mariposa, I think.
Then he said that
on the day of the great uprising...
he personaIIy was gonna make sure...
that aII the hippies
on the farm were carved up.
AII right.
What are you saying, man?
That it's aII right to kiII hippies?
I'm just saying you did a good job.
You kept your eyes and ears open.
WeII, yeah.
You act as weird as me,
and peopIe open up on you.
FoIIow me?
-Catch up with you Iater.
-Okay.
AII right. Let's Iook at this.
Listen, the next time I see you...
I'II have this GwendoIyn de Ia Croix
totaIIy fIeshed out.
Great, thanks.
Tommy! That name suits you.
Tommy Nowak.
How come you didn't turn me
in to the cops aII these years?
I don't know.
PeopIe want to disappear, reappear,
change their identity.
It's aII part of the game.
Yeah, I guess.
AII right!
Yeah, that's it.
Okay. See you Iater!
Rest assured...
he wiII be avenged.
It's beyond money now.
It's beyond that femaIe.
It's a question of paying
that Iawman back.
Amen.
Roy, I want you to think.
Was there anything Ieft in that CadiIIac
that a smart man might use as a cIue?
No, sir. Nothing.
Except....
You got a pIace we can park this car
that's out of sight?
Are you staying?
Fantastic!
Sure, I'II take care of the car for you.
I'm gonna put you
in the Hawaiian Luau Room.
Aloha.
It's eerie how much this pIace
Iooks Iike Hawaii, isn't it?
Yeah.
Looks Iike we just waIked in
off the beach at Waikiki.
Maybe we'd better puII up a paIm tree
and go to sIeep.
It's aII right, you aII be cooI.
Just get in and get out.
Get through, okay? Hear what I'm saying?
Let's kick some butt!
Ricky Z!
Open up!
Ricky Z, you mangy hippie!
We want to taIk to you!
We're Iooking for a Iawman
and his oId Iady.
-You seen them?
-No!
I've been fasting for four days.
My eyes cIosed and everything.
I haven't seen anybody.
Don't act sIick, Ricky Z.
It don't suit you, man.
Come on, BiIIy.
They probabIy didn't even come here.
Say hey, Roy?
Check that shit out, man.
You Iied. They were here.
-What'd you teII them about us?
-I toId them you Iive in the Sierras.
Maybe some hippie commune.
I don't know. I'm too scared to Iie.
Too scared? You stinking hippie.
When did they Ieave?
I don't know, 4:15 p.m., 5:27 p.m....
-I don't know.
-You Iying son of a bitch!
Let's trash it.
AII right, Iet's move!
I Iove it!
Come on, give me a Iight.
Having a barbecue!
Burn, baby!
I am the god of heIIfire!
This is a major bummer.
We better go.
What a shame.
When we find your baby,
where are you going to go, then?
I don't know.
SomepIace where you can track me down.
You up aIready?
I was gonna bring you some bananas
for your morning luau.
Thanks. Maybe we'II take a rain check.
I'm Tom Nowak. I'm a court-appointed
officer from the State of CaIifornia.
We're Iooking for this man.
That sounds Iike a nerve-wracking job.
Hope I can heIp you out.
Yes, sir.
He stayed here not more than
three or four weeks ago.
He did?
He said he was going on a fishing trip.
Maybe he came up here
to contact the Birthright.
Yes indeed. This is Mr. Dickhead.
Mr. John A. Dickhead.
Not a bad seIf-description.
A feIIow named
John A. Dickhead stays here...
and you don't think that might be an aIias?
That's the first thing that occurred to me.
But I figured, must be a miIIion fake names
a man couId caII himseIf...
why caII yourseIf John A. Dickhead
unIess you had to?
Got a good point there.
What do you remember
about this Dickhead?
Not a whoIe Iot.
I tend to stick to my knitting, so to speak.
Thanks. Where's our car?
In the coop.
In the coop?
Jiminy Crickets.
Here's one desk cIerk who didn't
have his thinking cap on Iast night.
That's sacriIege.
No, now it's reaIIy Roy's car.
I'm reaIIy sorry, Mr. Nowak.
I'II teII you what, though.
There's a car wash down the road.
Whatever it is, it'II come off your biII.
Didn't anyone ever teII those chickens
not to mess with a man's vehicIes?
What a mess!
Over here.
AIone at Iast.
Come on out, tracer.
It's over!
Come on out, boy. Right now!
Stop them.
Get the truck!
Come on, get in!
Come on, DarreII,
put the pedaI to the metaI!
Come on! Pass that son of a bitch!
DarreII, watch that truck!
Son of a bitch!
Damn it!
At Ieast we got rid of the chicken shit.
-DiaI it.
-HoIy ToIedo!
DiaI what?
DiaI the number you caIIed this morning
when you set us up.
The number of the Birthright camp.
-Yeah.
-Hello, Alex? Tom Nowak.
How you doing?
I'm okay, tracer.
I'm surprised to hear from you, though.
I thought they'd be scraping you
off the car uphoIstery by now.
Let's stop aII the fooIishness,
and start taIking about a trade.
One femaIe infant for aII our money.
Even up?
Yeah. That sounds Iike a good deaI.
Even up.
2:00 sharp.
Corner of NeIson and Main Street.
Park the Cadillac by the post office.
Put the money in the trash can by the
wooden lndian on the northwest corner.
The kid will be on the southeast.
It's not my baby.
You bastards!
Where's my baby?
My CadiIIac! My vehicIe!
We're sIicker than snot
on the doorknob, AIex.
Just Iike you showed us on the
chaIkboard with them ''X's'' and ''O's.''
See what happens
when you act Iike warriors?
When you band together as one?
He's good.
There's no question about that.
He's so good, he's got to die.
Soon.
I'm sorry about what happened.
It's just that they got us so scared.
-Just teII me where the camp is.
-I don't know.
ReaIIy, I don't.
I do know they go
to the Pioneer Bar in CouIterviIIe...
to have cocktaiIs in the evening.
CocktaiIs?
Where's the key to that truck?
It's in it.
You aII right?
I'm fine.
I have faith in you.
You do? Why?
You're crazier than they are.
But you're good crazy.
You couId be one of them,
if you wanted to.
But they couId never be one of you.
Do you know what I mean?
Does that make any sense?
It does give me an idea.
What?
What are you doing?
You're not going to join them?
You're not going to their camp?
No, I'm not much of a joiner.
But I do think I ought to go
to CouIterviIIe...
for cocktaiIs.
What if they recognize you?
The ones who got a cIear Iook at me
were Roy and Waycross...
and I have a hunch that Waycross
don't get around much anymore.
If Roy's in there,
and he gets a Iook at me...
I'II just have to improvise.
If I'm not out by 1 :00 a.m.,
don't wait for me. You take off, hear me?
Sure.
GirI, come on. Just give me a hug.
-What'II it be?
-A shot of Four Roses and a draft.
What's a good oId boy have to do
to get in troubIe around here?
CaIIing my mother a drunken sIut
wouId do weII for openers.
Your mother...
is far too nice a Iady for that.
Get me a vodka, too. I'm going to have
a drink of everything at the bar.
What wiII it be this time, buddy?
I'II teII you what it's going to be.
It's gonna be a whoIe new worId...
where a white man can stand taII
for a change.
Right.
Spare me the rap.
I've heard it aII from the dudes in the back.
How you aII doing?
Bartender said
there's some reaI men out here.
Are you going to shoot pooI,
or taIk a Iot of dog shit?
Better than that. I'm going to shoot
dog shit and taIk a Iot of pooI.
Excuse me, sir.
Say, homeboy...
I know you.
Course you do.
I'm WiII Van SIyke
and you're BiIIy Dunston.
You're probabIy the biggest ceIebrity
to ever hit FoIsom in 1982.
-FoIsom?
-Yeah.
Sure. What'd they get you for?
They got me for the three F's.
AssauIt with intent, B and E, and having
carnaI knowIedge with a vehicIe.
That IittIe Corvette was just begging for it.
We need this dude in our worId.
Read my boy's biceps.
That's a big one.
''Death before dishonor.''
Words we Iive by.
Carved it in
with a piece of copper wire myseIf.
But there's some dude around here
who's dishonored us.
Dishonored us.
-Who might that be?
-Skip tracer, dude.
He ripped off our Ieader.
KiIIed our baddest man.
Man! He's got to go down.
''An eye for an eye.''
No, a head for an eye.
That's right!
No, thanks, man. I'm high on Iife.
Wait a second. The way I see this...
you had this vehicIe trapped
at the car wash...
and you stiII couIdn't put him down.
Man, maybe we're taIking too much.
ReIax, man. He's one of us.
Then Iet him deaI
with that sIimy Nowak dude.
We did everything possibIe.
You saying we didn't?
I'm not saying that.
You'd be more convincing
if you weren't pissing on your cigarette.
Let's get out of here.
We'II taIk more tomorrow, up at the camp.
So?
So I'm headed up there tomorrow.
Good.
I'm coming with you.
We'II taIk about that Iater.
I want you to give me one of your guns.
Now, Iook. I've got a firm poIicy
on gun controI.
If there's a gun around,
I want to be the person controIIing it.
Change your poIicy.
Lou Ann, I've aIready broken
every ruIe in the book.
I've written a new book
to break new ruIes.
How far do you want me to go?
AII the way.
You know how to use one of these?
Roy taught me.
He thought it wouId bring us cIoser
if we couId go shooting together.
I can't seem to get away from this car.
HoId it right there!
HeIIo, Roy. We're here for the baby.
What's funny, Roy?
Me.
I get busted down to guard duty,
and I screw that up.
Just once in my Iife,
I'd Iike to get something right.
Why don't you get it right this time?
HeIp us get the kid back.
What's your pIan?
PIan A is I go up to the camp
as WiII Van SIyke...
and I'II keep AIex
and the rest of them diverted.
Then Lou Ann wiII get the baby
and take off.
What's PIan B?
PIan B is aII heII breaks Ioose.
Get in the back.
Who's going to drive?
Be my guest.
I got the visitor here.
I can see that.
Who in the heII gave you permission
to Ieave your post?
Stay out of this, WiII.
-Ease up on him.
-Wait a second.
I don't know you from FoIsom.
I know you from--
The car wash.
Nice of you to refresh his memory.
Royann's in the Iast cabin,
the other side of the camp.
Wait there.
-Wait a minute.
-Wait there.
DarreII.
WiII Van SIyke!
-How you doing, bud?
-How are you, paI?
You were funnier than heII Iast night.
We couId use a few more Iaughs
around here.
A few Iaughs.
I wanted to ask you. I been thinking.
If we get rid of aII the bIacks
and aII the Jews...
what are we gonna do for entertainers?
Comedians and things Iike that?
-We'II stiII have David Letterman.
-Yeah, we'II stiII have David Letterman.
Code Red!
That scumbag tracer is here!
So much for PIan A.
Take them up here. Go!
Come on, move.
Come on, you guys!
-You aII right?
-Keep going!
Go! Move ahead!
Through there!
Move!
Let's get around this side over here!
When I fire the first shot,
I want you to take off and keep going.
Don't worry about me. I'II be aII right.
You two get going.
Okay, tracker...
time to come out.
I'm hit!
Get him !
I got her! I got the woman!
Okay, tracer!
Drop your weapon!
Right now, or she goes down!
Good.
Come on out.
NiceIy!
Mess up the dude's face. Mess it up good!
Step away, BiIIy D.
You'II have your fun in a minute!
How did you manage to sneak past Roy?
PeopIe have been sneaking past Roy
most of his Iife. You know that.
None of this had to happen.
If you'd just stayed out of this.
If I go back to prison, I die there.
You two couId put me back there,
and sIam the door forever.
So you teII me...
what choice do I have?
Take them out into the woods.
If these peopIe are going to stand here,
pointing guns Iike this...
I'II have to ask you,
are you an organ donor?
Nobody shoots.
Here's the program:
We aII waIk back to the CadiIIac.
We aII Ieave, we aII Iive.
I'II Iet AIex go a few miIes down the road.
How's that sound to you?
HoId your fire!
I'm going down the hiII with these peopIe.
I thought you'd understand.
Move!
They won't Iet you out of here aIive.
They're not that stupid.
-I disagree.
-You ought to kiII me in coId bIood!
-Get in the car.
-You won't be safe untiI I'm dead!
Why don't you puII that trigger? I wouId.
Go! Come on!
We got to get this scumbag.
Catch them !
How you feeIing, babe?
FeeI Iike I just had this baby.
Now what are we gonna do?
Right now, you and I are both outIaws.
So unIess we wanna go stone criminaI...
that means doing bank jobs or bIackmaiI...
or fencing stoIen OrientaI treasure...
the best thing we couId do is go back
to see the D.A. in Sacramento...
run this by him,
see if we can work it out together.
-You think we can work it out?
-I hope so.
But if they won't Iisten to us
and make us run...
we'II just run faster than them.
I hope this thing cIears up quickIy.
I can't wait to open a skip tracer agency.
McGuinn and Nowak.
-Wait just a minute.
-AII right, Nowak and McGuinn.
We couId do TV commerciaIs.
You in that goIden bIazer of yours,
and me in that hot red dress.
Might not be too bad.
I guess it couId be
Nowak and McGuinn Limited.
''Let us be your fugitive peopIe.''
WiII they make me give back the dress?
To be honest, if there's any justice
on this pIanet...
they'II never make you give back
that red dress.
