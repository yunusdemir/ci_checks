<i>Buenos Aires is growing
uncontrollably and imperfectly.</i>
<i>An overpopulated city
in a deserted country.</i>
<i>A city in which thousands
of buildings rise into the sky.</i>
<i>Arbitrarily.</i>
<i>Next to a tall one, a small one.</i>
<i>Next to a rational one,
an irrational one.</i>
<i>Next to a French one,
one with no style at all.</i>
<i>These irregularities
probably reflect us perfectly.</i>
Aesthetic and ethical
irregularities.
<i>These buildings,
which adhere to no logic,</i>
<i>represent bad planning.</i>
<i>Just like our lives:</i>
<i>We have no idea how
we want them to be.</i>
<i>We live as if Buenos Aires
were a stopover.</i>
<i>We've created
a "culture of tenants".</i>
<i>The buildings are becoming smaller
to make space for even smaller ones.</i>
<i>Apartments are measured
by their number of rooms</i>
<i>and range from five rooms
with balconies,</i>
<i>playrooms, servants' quarters
and storerooms</i>
<i>to one-room apartments
also known as "shoeboxes".</i>
<i>Just like almost
all man-made objects,</i>
buildings are made
to differentiate between us.
<i>There's a front and a back side.
High and low apartments.</i>
<i>Privileged people have the letter A
or sometimes B.</i>
<i>The farther back in the alphabet,
the worse the apartment.</i>
<i>The promised view and brightness
rarely coincide with reality.</i>
<i>What can be expected of a city
that turns its back on its river?</i>
<i>I'm convinced that separations,
divorces</i>
<i>domestic violence,
the excess of cable TV stations,</i>
<i>the lack of communication,
listlessness,</i>
<i>apathy, depression, suicide,</i>
<i>neuroses, panic attacks,</i>
obesity, tenseness,
<i>insecurity, hypochondria,</i>
<i>stress and a sedentary lifestyle</i>
<i>are attributable to architects
and builders.</i>
<i>I suffer from all of these illnesses
except suicide.</i>
<i>This is my one-room apartment.
400 square feet</i>
<i>and one miserable window
for one breathless lung.</i>
<i>Santa Fé, 1105.</i>
<i>Fourth ?oor. H.</i>
<i>I sat down at my computer
ten years ago</i>
<i>and feel like
I've never got up again.</i>
<i>I don't know if the Internet is
the future, but it was mine:</i>
<i>I design websites
and this is my cyberspace</i>
<i>I don't know if I'm good
or just got into it early,</i>
<i>but I'm very busy.</i>
<i>I began with my psychiatrist’s
website for phobics:</i>
<i>His specialty and the reason
why I visit him twice a week.</i>
<i>This game is a hit.</i>
<i>It's for insomniacs
fighting pill addiction.</i>
<i>My psychiatrist calls me
a phobic on my way to recovery.</i>
<i>Due to repeated, violent panic attacks,
I locked myself in my apartment</i>
<i>for years.</i>
<i>I won 17 championships
at expert level.</i>
<i>Four times undefeated,
nine times top scorer.</i>
<i>I beat Federer four times
at Wimbledon.</i>
<i>I became Godfather
of the Corleone family</i>
<i>I was totally isolated. Scared.</i>
<i>My psychiatrist developed
a strategy to help me overcome</i>
<i>my fear of the city:
Photography.</i>
<i>A way to rediscover
the city and people.</i>
<i>A search for beauty where
it's not apparent.</i>
<i>Observing is being and not being.</i>
<i>Or being in another way.</i>
<i>I distracted myself.</i>
<i>I don't take the bus or taxis.
Much less the subway,</i>
<i>and I'd never take a plane.
I only go by foot</i>
<i>and always have
my survival backpack.</i>
<i>Contents: a Leica D-Lux 3
with 10 mega pixels.</i>
<i>Rivotril drops, 2.5 mg.
Amoxicillin 500.</i>
<i>Ibuprofen. Sunglasses.
A plastic rain coat.</i>
<i>A Victorinox with 21 tools.</i>
<i>Flashlight with batteries.
Condoms, three units.</i>
<i>400 pesos cash in small bills.
An iPod with 60 GB</i>
<i>and more than 8,000 songs.</i>
<i>Three Tati films. A notebook.
And a plastic card</i>
<i>about how to proceed
in case of an accident</i>
<i>or panic attack.</i>
<i>The backpack weighs 5.8 kG.
7 % of my body weight.</i>
<i>I've been an architect for two years,
but still haven't built anything.</i>
<i>Neither a building, nor a house,
nor a bathroom. Nothing.</i>
<i>Only models that are uninhabitable,
and not only because of their scale...</i>
<i>I didn't fare well
with other constructions either:</i>
<i>My four-year relationship collapsed</i>
<i>despite my ef fons to shore it up.</i>
<i>If my life were a game of life,</i>
<i>I'd have to move back five spaces.</i>
<i>That's why I'm here:</i>
<i>With my disorderly life in 27 boxes,</i>
<i>I sit on twelve meters
of bubble wrap, popping bubbles</i>
<i>so that I myself don't pop.</i>
<i>This is my new old shoebox</i>
<i>that these ridiculous five steps
make into a "duplex".</i>
<i>And this is the freakish thing,
half window, half balcony,</i>
<i>that the sun shuns all year long.</i>
<i>Avenida Santa Fe, 1183.
Eighth floor. G</i>
<i>as in gastritis.</i>
<i>This is my favourite building
in Buenos Aires.</i>
<i>It's the best location
and the most fun.</i>
<i>It's built with
my favourite materials:</i>
Concrete, steel and glass.
<i>One of the world's few buildings</i>
<i>with an equilateral
triangular base,</i>
<i>it was inspired
by Saturn and its rings.</i>
<i>Even if most people
see a flying saucer.</i>
<i>I enter it expecting
to take off and leave this world.</i>
<i>But in reality,
the planetarium puts me in my place,</i>
<i>reminding me that
the world doesn't revolve around me.</i>
<i>I'm a very small
pan of a planet</i>
<i>that's pan of a system
that's pan of a galaxy</i>
<i>that, like hundreds of thousands
of galaxies, forms pan of the universe.</i>
<i>It reminds me that I'm pan of
an infinite and eternal whole.</i>
A SHORT AUTUMN
The dog committed suicide.
Apparently it was a 40-year-old
prostitute's only companion
and was locked out on the balcony
so it wouldn't bother her customers.
The dog went mad when
they touched her.
No wonder it jumped
Alone, on such a small balcony.

DISC ARTHROSIS
You look terrible,
but you're perfectly healthy.
The only strange things are the fifth and sixth
vertebrae, which you've had since birth.
Otherwise, you'd be screaming
in pain, so it's not that.
Are you dizzy? No.
Just do some fitness training
and lighten up your backpack.
There's nothing serious,
nothing at all.
You see...
Those reports are written by kids
in laboratories or hospitals
who write
down everything to protect
themselves.
They're not perfect.
What can you do?
If you want to worry, go ahead,
but not about that.
You're the same.
<i>Until I can work as an architect,
I'm designing shop windows.</i>
<i>It distracts me
from other thoughts.</i>
<i>I think of the windows
as lost places.</i>
<i>They're neither inside
nor outside.</i>
<i>An abstract and magic space.</i>
<i>They reflect a pan of me.</i>
<i>At the same time,
the anonymity calms me.</i>
<i>Maybe it's stupid, burl think:</i>
<i>If someone stops to look,</i>
<i>they're somehow interested in me.</i>
<i>I've had this book since I was 14.</i>
<i>And forgive me, great writers,</i>
<i>but it's a key book in my life.</i>
<i>It's the origin of
my fear of crowds,</i>
<i>which has become existential.</i>
<i>It dramatically represents</i>
<i>the fear of knowing
I'm one lost person among millions.</i>
<i>Years have passed and I still can't
solve one of the puzzles:</i>
<i>"Wally in the City".</i>
<i>I found him shopping,
at the airport and the beach,</i>
but not in the city.
<i>Perhaps my nerves
have blinded me.</i>
<i>So I'm wondering:</i>
<i>If I can't find a person
when I know who I'm looking for,</i>
<i>how can I find a person when
I don't know who I'm looking for?</i>
"Hi, I'm Susú,
part stuffed animal and part dog."
<i>Seven years ago, my girlfriend
visited her parents</i>
<i>in New Jersey, USA.
She wanted to stay for a few weeks.</i>
<i>As painful as it was for her,
she called me collect to say</i>
<i>she wasn't coming back.</i>
<i>It was her new home and she'd
realised she was very American.</i>
<i>Ingenious! She felt very American
when Argentina was devalued.</i>
<i>The truth is, there wasn't much
to keep her here: me and her dog.</i>
<i>She left her with the best
of intentions too.</i>
<i>She claimed the change in language</i>
<i>would be too difficult for her.</i>
You know planes make me nervous.
Please take the rock I travel with.
- You've only travelled once.
- Well, it worked.
It's my kabbalah. Do it for me.
Alright.
<i>AH at once,
I lost the woman I loved</i>
<i>and my ability to fly.</i>
<i>Hello, this is Mariana.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>
<i>Hello, hello. Are you there?</i>
<i>Alright. I just wanted
to tell you that tonight</i>
<i>a great film will be on TV</i>
<i>with Bill Murray
and the groundhog.</i>
<i>And because you took the TV,
I thought we could watch it together.</i>
<i>Pick up. I know you're there.</i>
<i>Are you with a guy?
You screwed me!</i>
<i>How can you be close
to someone so different?</i>
<i>That's the stupid conclusion
after a four-year relationship.</i>
<i>Four years are 48 months.</i>
<i>1460 days.</i>
<i>35,040 hours
with the wrong person.</i>
<i>I watched him one night
and realised everything:</i>
<i>For the first time, he was distant,</i>
<i>as if he were completely unfamiliar.</i>
<i>I suddenly feared
being alone with a stranger.</i>
<i>And here I am:</i>
In the same apartment
that I abandoned to live with him.
<i>In front of the same mirror.
Four years later.</i>
A LONG WINTER
Thanks.

DOG SITTER
Come here, Susú.
Come here, Susú. Come.
- This is Susú.
- Alright.
She's not used to
being with other animals.
- Then you'd better come with us.
- Alright, I'll take her.
- Can you get me a fag from my pocket?
- Here?
- Got a light?
- No.
- Get it from my pocket.
- Here?
- How long?
- Are you gay?
- Because of the dog
- Oh, right.
It's not mine. It belongs to a friend
who went to the USA.
She asked me to take care of it.
She had a problem
and couldn't come back,
sol kept it.
And since she left,
it's... it's more depressed,
it doesn't bark, it's insecure
and doesn't want to leave the house.
So I thought it'd be good
for it to meet other dogs and people.
I think she's adapting.
What do you think?
I thought you were gay.
I can't concentrate.
Maybe another time
Alright.
- Alright, bye.
- And what do we do? Should I call you?
- I'll be back tomorrow.
- Alright. Everything okay?
More or less. Bye.
Want to eat dinner?
Or should I wait until spring?
- Now?
- Do you have time?
I wanted to start swimming.
I'm tense.
- It's not time to start swimming.
- No, it's never time to swim.
Then let's eat.
Here it is.
Have you been here?
I've seen the building
but didn't know it has a restaurant.
I thought they were offices.
I thought it might be interesting
for an architect.
Shall we go up?
I'll take the stairs.
It's on the 20th floor.
Well...
You'll probably think I'm crazy,
but...
I have a phobia of them.
I don't use lifts.
Especially when
they're hermetically sealed.
I get claustrophobia.
Do you live on the ground floor?
- On the eighth.
- Seriously?
I think twice before leaving
the flat.
I go up at least three times a day.
Want to try it with me?
What?
No, I mean take the lift.
I know a good
ground floor restaurant
I'm curious to see the city
from so high up.
I'll Walk.
- I'll join you.
- That's not necessary. Really
You wouldn't make it anyway.
- Of course I will.
- But...
Now that you've finally said "yes'"
When did you last use a lift?
- Two or three years ago.
- Did something bad happen?
Don't speak.
You'll be out of breath.
Administer it.
- Have you tried closing your eyes?
- If that would only work.
The last time I climbed so many steps
was at Teotihuacan's Pyramid
of the Sun. 40 degrees
and not one miserable cloud
in the middle of the desert.
And 260 awkward steps.
They say the top of the pyramid
is a point
of cosmic energy
that fulfils your wishes.
My wish was not to fall
on my way back down.
Some people go back down on
their arses so they don't fall.
That's typical of religions:
They promise the improbable
so you don't regret
the sacrifices they demand.
I hope I won't regret
climbing these stairs.
Everything alright?
Don't you want to take the lift?
- Yes. That'd be better.
- See you at the top.
Smoking is killing me.
- Should I order a water for you?
- Go ahead.
- Sparkling or still?
- Still!
<i>My relationship with Pablo
corresponded with the digital age.</i>
<i>At the beginning,</i>
I bought a camera

<i>Before I had my lift phobia,</i>
<i>I gave tours
in the Kavanagh building.</i>
<i>I had no problem taking
the 15 lifts</i>
<i>through 31 floors of
the city's most beautiful skyscraper:</i>
<i>The world's largest concrete
construction at the end of the 1930s.</i>
<i>A building as striking
as the history that it conceals.</i>
<i>Corina Kavanagh
was a beautiful woman</i>
<i>from a wealthy,
but plebeian family</i>
<i>who fell in love
with a young man of nobility.</i>
<i>The Anchorenas opposed
the relationship and broke it up.</i>
<i>Their most important possession</i>
<i>was the Basilica
Santisimo Sacramento,</i>
<i>a temple they built
which later became the family tomb.</i>
<i>The Anchorenas' palace
was on the other side of the park</i>
<i>and they wanted a new one
next to the basilica.</i>
<i>Corina Kavanagh sold three farms</i>
<i>and had a skyscraper built
for one reason:</i>
<i>To hide the basilica's facade</i>
<i>and prevent the Anchorenas
from seeing it.</i>
<i>It's only visible
from "Corina Kavanagh" alley.</i>

I'll name her Corina.</i>
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
Great, thanks. Here!
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M AT THE CINEMA
- Can I put some music on?
- Of course.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME.
WHAT MOVIE?
You have thousands.
How am I supposed to choose?
- I don't like them.
- Let me choose one.
I WANT TO SEE YOU.
WILL MEET YOU AT THE EXIT.
IT'S TERRIBLY LONG.
I'M TURNING MY MOBILE OFF.
SENDING TO MARIELA
- You hardly ate anything.
- I don't eat much in the evening.
Did I tell you I'm writing a play?
You've hardly said anything all night.
Really? I'm in a weird mood,
I don't know why.
I didn't know you write
Me neither.
Until now.
I've studied theatre for a while.
Should I tell you about it?
It's called "Cruel Woman".
There's a swing on stage,
the protagonist
and seven Dalmatians.
So the audience listens to
a monologue with headphones,
and what they hear are
her thoughts.
She's planning
to kill the dogs' owners
so she can keep them for herself.
You like it?
It sounds good.
I'd have to read it.
I act in it.
You're the one who
walks the drugs?
- "Walks the drugs"?
- Did I say "drugs"?
Good one!

We separated at De Gaulle.
Yes, a 13-hour flight

our own luggage.
We divided up our goods

<i>This is the 15th time

<i>I hate getting undressed

<i>a wet swimsuit, wet flip-flops...</i>
<i>I hate the smell of chlorine.</i>
<i>I hate the membership card

<i>I hate that people

<i>I hate caps and the amazed

<i>And what I hate most is the fact that
it's the most complete sport there is.</i>
Tired?
Are you tired?
You have to kick less.
Legs consume more oxygen
than arms.
Kicking is more for stabilization
than for propulsion.
Stretch out and relax your legs.
When your hand goes
into the water,
stretch it out, feel the impulse
and the other arm follows.
Your hands under your body.
And lower your head. The water
should be up to your forehead.
You're doing 32 strokes.
Try what I'm saying.
You'll do fewer strokes
and tire less.
You'll swim in a more relaxed way.
And try breathing every third stroke.
Go ahead, I'll count.
- May I?
- Yes.
- And?
- You were right, I'm not as tired.
30 strokes. Two fewer per lap
and you can get even lower.
- Are you a teacher?
- I'm a compulsive swimmer.
I can't sleep if
I don't swim an hour a day.
Really? Exhaustion from swimming
is unrivalled.
Yes, nothing else tires me out.
- What's your name?
- Rafa. And you?
Mariana.
What's it, asshole?
- Let me past!
- Go ahead!
- You're a clown!
- What the hell are you doing?
Idiot!
Always the same! Screw you!
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
I still have 30 laps!
I'm a member and I paid my fee!
- This is supposed to relax you.
- Living healthily is stressful.
Being conscious of everything
only to live a bit longer
is the worst thing we can do.
None of us come here for fun
We come to count laps.
- Why can't you sleep?
- I thought you'd know already.
There's no switch
to turn off my head.
- Have you seen a psychologist?
- Yes, I am a psychologist.
So swimming is the only thing
that works?
If I could,
I'd swim to my bedside.
'28! .very good!
Tomorrow I can't swim
I've got patients until 10 p.m.,
so I won't be able to sleep.
We could go and eat
or drink something.
- Shalli put you to sleep?
- On the contrary.
What a relief. Then yes.
Let's take off our caps and goggles
so we'll recognise each other.
No, I'll come like this.
It doesn't matter, I don't care.
Everything's alright.
<i>The brilliant morning light</i>

SPRING AT LAST
<i>Absolutely all of the buildings

<i>The ”medianera” or "side wall“.</i>
<i>Enormous surfaces that divide us,

<i>”Medianeras”

They reflect inconstancy, cracks,
<i>provisional solutions,</i>
<i>and the dirt we sweep under
the carpet.</i>
<i>We only remember
them in exceptional cases</i>
<i>when, during bad weather,</i>
<i>its ads filter through.</i>
<i>”Medianeras” have changed
into another medium for ads</i>
<i>that are seldom beautiful.</i>
<i>Generally,
they indicate how far we are</i>

<i>Lottery ads that promise a lot
for little.</i>

<i>Recently, they've reminded us of

<i>Welcome to the era

Is this your first time chatting?
Yes. Did you notice?
Very much so.
You have to begin with M or W.
What's that?
Man or woman
Woman. A broad term, isn't it?
- And you?
- Man.
- Do I have to believe you?
- It's easy to verify.
I write like a man,
think like a man,
and act like a man.
And?
What?
Your turn. In the arse
I don't know what to say.
It's strange talking to someone
I don't know.
What do you want to know?
I don't even know where to begin
I'm taking off. Bye.
Don't leave! Wait!
Are you still there?
I'll give you a list of questions:
How old are you?
What sign are you?
What music do you listen to?
Do you believe in God?
What did you do today?
That's cheating.
It's a question.
Okay. I woke up at twelve
because I went to bed at five.
I should start swimming.
I ate breakfast at one.
I took an ibuprofen.
At two I started work.
I do web design.
At five I ate lunch.
At eight I went to therapy.
I took my second ibuprofen.
Then the telephone rang,
which made me happy.
Wrong number.
Now I'm eating dinner.
After chatting, I'll whack myself on
the head so I can fall asleep
and start swimming tomorrow.
DID YOU TAKE OFF?
YES!
Good. What did you do today?
Adaptation.
Getting used to being single again.
I'm an expert.
I could write a book.
I'm a kind of depressed
Paulo Coelho.
I didn't have a good day.
I'M SO SAD.
I have a method.
Absolutely involuntary.
A kind of Buddhist gene that makes
my happy days not so happy
and my sad days not so sad.
A spiritual thermostat.
And if it fails?
I down a Rivotril.
I didn't think I'd laugh today.
In return, do me a favour.
When do you wake up?
Nine.
I'll give you my number. Call me
at nine and motivate me to swim.
Why not now?
No, that won't do. It's a deal.
Give me your number.
Bloody bastard! Fucking hell!
Bloody bastard!
Why do I keep all this shit?
Wait Susú, I'll be right back.
- Do you have any candles?
- Yes, wait a minute...
I'll be right with you.
Four pesos.
- Any candles left?
- I think so. Let me look...
- I got a shock.
- Yeah, me too.
- Probably the flashlight.
- I don't know, but it was heavy.
Here they are, the last ones.
Your lucky day!
Right, good to know.
- How much?
- Four pesos.
- My luck's a bit expensive.
- Yeah.
- How much for this?
- Nine.
Thanks. Bye.
Something else?
What do you have for a peso
so we can round it up?
