All right.
Hungry?
Okay, one dinner comin' right up.
3:00 in the morning,
I gotta get up and get you some food.
Come on, kitty.
I don't got none.
You want some peanut butter?
Courry brand cat food?
All I can see are empty cans.
Let's fix you up
one of my famous concoctions.
Wait a second. Don't get so hungry.
Here you are.
It'll be delicious.
You can't do better than that at Chasen's.
Here, kitty.
Come on.
You're hungry, right?
Think of the tigers in India they're killing
because they don't get enough to eat.
Don't believe that one?
Okay-
Courry's brand cat food.
You clawed me, you son of a bitch.
Why don't you go home to India?
Wanna help me on with my jacket?
Why don't you go there and tell
those girls they're gonna catch a cold.
Courry's brand cat food.
Cat gets me up at 3:00 in the morning
to get him a special kind of food.
I gotta be outta my fuckin' mind.
Boy, that cockamamie cat.
Mr. Marlowe.
Crazy girls.
Mr. Marlowe, are you going by the store?
Yeah, I'm gonna go
and pick up a couple cans of cat food.
Could you pick me up some brownie mix?
I'd really like to make some.
- <i>I'll get you some brownie mix.</i>
- Get two boxes.
- Two boxes.
- Fudge kind.
Fudge kind and regular kind.
- You're the nicest neighbor we ever had.
- Gotta be the nicest neighbor.
I'm a private eye. It's okay with me.
Hi, Mr. Lennox. You're up kind of late.
- Come on, lay it on me.
- Yeah, I didn't... Barbara Stanwyck.
I been workin' on Barbara Stanwyck.
I'll show you.
"I don't understand it.
I don't understand it at all.
"I've never understood it, Walter.
I just don't understand why."
Just remember that,
and you'll be all right.
- Mr. Marlowe, the lights in your car are on.
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.
Two for the price of one.
"Super buy. Extra discount."
21 cents for macaroni'?
Never seen so many cat foods in my...
Excuse me,
I don't see any Courry brand cat food.
- Some what?
- Courry brand cat food.
- Can you spell that for me, please?
- Yeah. Courry brand. C-o-u-r--
We're outta that. Why don't you get this?
All this shit is the same anyway.
- You don't have a cat, by any chance?
- What do I need a cat for? I got a girl.
He's got a girl, and I got a cat.
Mr. Marlowe, did you get the brownie mix?
- I got you two boxes of--
- What kind did you get, Mr. Marlowe'?
I got a regular and one with brownie mixed
with a double fudge inverted...
- Fantastic.
- Good night, girls.
- How much do we owe you?
- That's okay, just put it on the bill.
- Thanks.
- <i>I'll save you a brownie.</i>
Thanks a lot, but they hurt my teeth.
But if you want to make me
a couple of Yankee Doodles...
I love the cat.
The cat's hungry. Right.
Did I lock you out of the kitchen?
I'll fix your dinner
just as soon as I get me a smoke.
All right, here you are.
Courry Brand. Finest I could find.
Yes.
I'll open this thing up right away.
Don't want you not to have
your favorite kind of cat food.
Okay-
Look at this.
Well? Go on. There it is.
So it's not Courry's Cat Food.
It's okay with me.
Don't run out on me now, you silly cat.
- Marlowe.
- Terry, how you--
- What are you doing up at this hour?
- Come in, I'll be right there.
What am I doin' at this hour?
Terry Lennox.
Terry, I was just feeding my cat.
You oughta feed your cat a little
more, too. What happened to you?
A beauty, isn't it?
Proud of that son of a bitch.
- You and Sylvia goin' at it again?
- Yeah. You like to hear the sordid details?
No, I heard them before.
You like to lose a couple of bucks?
Yeah.
- I got an "L".
- "L"?
"D." Four sevens.
- You think I believe you got four sevens?
- Probably think I don't have any.
Yeah.
Then, I gotta say five sevens.
I challenge.
- Challenge? How many you got?
- None.
None. I got three. That's good.
Who were the three DiMaggio brothers?
Vince, Don...
...and Joe?
Joltin' Joe, yeah.
Want me to fix up
the couch for you tonight?
Well, Marlowe,
that's what I'm here to talk to you about.
- I really need more than that.
- You wanna sleep in my bed?
There's gonna be a lot of people lookin'
for me as a result of my lovely wife.
I really need a ride.
- Where do you want me to take you?
- Tijuana.
Tijuana?
- Tijuana now?
- Now, Tijuana.
- Thanks, Marlowe.
- You take care of yourself.
Don't worry about me.
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>
Thanks a lot.
- Arizona.
- Phoenix.
- Kansas--
- City.
- How about Michigan?
- Detroit? Milwaukee?
Right on.
Okay, your turn.
Montana?
Montana. Billings.
Florida'?
- Miami.
- Right.
- How about Washington?
- Washington, D.C.
- Girls, did you see my cat?
- I didn't even know you had a cat.
- Did you say you wanted a hat?
- No, you don't look fat.
Here, kitty.
- Your name Marlowe'?
- No, my name is Sidney Jenkins.
- Let's go inside. We wanna talk to you.
- I'm looking for my cat.
Forget the goddamned cat, come on.
Forget the goddamn cat? All right, I see.
Okay-
That cat means an awful lot to me.
You tell me to forget about it.
Must be something mighty important.
- Sit down, Marlowe.
- That's okay, I'd rather stand.
I don't mind sitting either.
I'm Sergeant Green.
This is Detective Dayton.
Yeah, I saw your badge, where's his?
Where'd you go last night, Marlowe'?
Is this where I'm supposed to say,
"What is all this about?"
- And he says, "Shut up, I ask the questions"?
- That's right, Marlowe.
Just answer the questions.
Where did you go last night?
Maybe if I knew why you wanted to know,
I could remember.
- You gainfully employed, Marlowe'?
- No.
- Where do you work?
- I heard you. I understand English.
I'm a private detective.
I have my own agency.
Those girls are vicious.
I take a better picture now, but
business hasn't been as good as it used to.
I'm sure you guys understand that.
Marlowe, you know a white guy
by the name of Terry Lennox.
Who says I do'?
His address book and that yellow bomb
downstairs in your garage.
So?
Just answer the question.
You wanna know what I did last night?
My cat woke me up in the middle
of the night. He was really hungry.
So I went to fix him his favorite
kind of cat food, Courry Brand.
It's the only kind he eats. I was out
of it, so I fixed somethin' else up.
The cat clawed the hell outta me.
He wouldn't touch it.
So I went out to the Thrifty Mart,
it's open 24 hours...
...to get some Courry Brand cat food
and they were out it. Son of a bitch.
I got a couple other cans,
and I came back and switched the labels...
...on the cans around,
and the son-of-a-bitch cat just left.
- Will you forget the goddamn cat?
- Yeah, I know.
Courry Brand cat food?
- Yeah, you got any?
- Here, take this.
Now, we know what time Lennox
left the Malibu Colony...
...and we know about
what time he got here.
Your girlfriends there were so busy makin'
their hash pies they didn't notice anything.
- What the hell is this, Marlowe'?
- It's a baby shoe.
Now Lennox left his car parked in your
garage and then he went somewhere.
Since you went somewhere, it would be
logical to assume that you went together.
Suppose you tell me where.
I don't have to answer any questions
you ask unless you have a specific charge.
I know that.
So if you don't have a specific charge, I'd
appreciate it if you go down the elevator--
Dayton, do we have a specific charge
against Marlowe'?
Goddamn it.
Marlowe, if you broke my partial--
Come on, your partial... You bet your ass!
- Get up!
- Come on, you're okay. I'm okay.
- You're not gonna pull this shit, are you?
- Read it to him, Dayton.
You gonna read something to me?
- "You have the right to..."
- My rights. I got a lot of rights.
"...and will be used against you.
You have the right..."
- You got any cotton candy?
- Right profile.
Right profile.
- Is there a merry-go-round around here?
- Straight ahead.
Straight ahead.
- My, you are a pretty asshole.
- My mother always tells me that.
All right, come on, let's get your prints.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- We have a room waiting for you.
- You got a towel I could wipe this on'?
- Use your shirt.
- This is my good shirt.
Come on, you'll all be
together in paradise.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
They got you, too? Man, how's your cat?
- Ran off. How's your girl'?
- She's all right!
She got busted at a protest rally.
I had to bust the pig that busted her.
Come on, goddamn it!
- Here, he's all yours.
- I bought some cat...
- This is the question and answer time.
- All right, sit down.
Sit down.
<i>Sit down, don't dirty up my joint.
Sit down right here.</i>
<i>- All right, what's your name, now, again?
- My name is Donald Duck.</i>
<i>You know my name.</i>
<i>- What's your name?
- My name is Philip Marlowe.</i>
- He's a real cutie-pie, Lieutenant.
- He's a smart-ass, that's what he is.
That's what I meant.
Why don't you learn to say
what you mean?
He's a real smart-ass, Lieutenant.
<i>Hi, boys.
Who's in there, J. Edgar Hoover in there?</i>
<i>Sure, we're all peeking through.</i>
<i>All right, look.</i>
<i>- You got an "e" on your name?
- Yeah.</i>
<i>It sounds like a fag name.</i>
Fag? Is that what you are?
- I'm a fag.
- You got ladies' drawers on'?
Anybody with Phillip Marlowe
has gotta be a fag.
Sounds like an ad
for an academy for faggots.
Listen, what are you here for?
I'm here 'cause I'm gettin' ready
for the big game Saturday.
We're playing Notre Dame
and I hope I catch a touchdown pass.
I don't know what I'm doin' here.
I'm gettin' into my makeup.
- Fags make up. That's...
- You got a banjo? I'll do my AI Jolson.
<i>This guy sounds like a fag.
He'll do your dirty work.</i>
<i>What are you doing here? Yd like to know.</i>
<i>I'm getting ready to sing Swanee.</i>
<i>- "Swanee, how Hove you"
- Sure. I got A! Jolson singing.</i>
<i>- He was okay.
- Damn right he was.</i>
<i>But here's what 1 wanna know.</i>
<i>- What the hell are we doing?
- Just sweatin'.</i>
<i>You don't tie in. This suit.
The name Marlowe.</i>
<i>- What the hell are you from, an exodus?
- Smart-ass.</i>
<i>I'm from along time ago.
I went to a prep school.</i>
<i>No, you don't look like prep school,
but that's not important.</i>
What's important is you better have
the right answers when Farmer gets here.
Here's your man, Lieutenant.
A real cutie-pie.
<i>- How do you do, sir?
- You look very good, Marlowe.</i>
<i>- Why don't you sit down and stay there?
- Okay.</i>
<i>We don't want you banged up.</i>
<i>Somebody might get
the wrong impression.</i>
<i>Tell me, Marlowe...</i>
...why can't you answer
one simple question?
For two reasons.
I don't like how you ask questions,
and what you wanna know.
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah.
<i>- I'm gonna give you one more chance...
- He's the cutie-pie.</i>
You're the smart-ass,
you little honky bastard.
<i>Come on, or I'll throw the book at you.</i>
<i>- What's the charges?
- Don't give me that innocent crap.</i>
<i>You expect me to believe that Lennox
showed up in the night...</i>
<i>...and you drove him a few
hundred miles and he didn't tell you?</i>
<i>That's what I've been tellin' you.</i>
<i>You wanna hear the charges? Okay.</i>
<i>- Accessory after the fact of murder.
- Who's dead?</i>
<i>Aiding a felon in unlawful flight.</i>
<i>Lieutenant, who's dead?</i>
Terry Lennox's wife, that's who's dead.
And not a nice dead.
- I don't believe it.
- Believe she's dead, that's obvious.
<i>- So what don't you believe?
- I don't</i> believe <i>that Terry is a killer.</i>
<i>You don't think he could
beat a woman to death?</i>
<i>- How long have you known him?
- A long time.</i>
<i>- What is that supposed to mean?
- Long time.</i>
<i>- A long time.
- Yeah.</i>
<i>- From college?
- I didn't go to college. Before that.</i>
<i>So you didn't go to college.
What was his real name?</i>
- You guys know his real name.
- We know it, but you tell us.
- Lenny Potts.
- Lenny Potts?
It wasn't fancy enough, so he changed it.
Fancy?
Fancy, my ass.
He was a gambler, a hood.
- Thick as thieves with Marty Augustine.
- So what does that mean?
- He was always splitting up with his wife.
- He loved his wife, you know.
- Was she cheating on him?
- Are you cheating on your wife?
Maybe. But my wife's not dead.
Was he cheating on her'?
Is your wife cheating on you?
How come you know so little about
your dear old pal, Marlowe'?
Or are you just dummying up?
Last night, what'd he tell you?
That he was in a jam
with his gambling associates?
That he was fighting with his wife again?
What excuse did he give you?
<i>The hey with it. Take him out! Book him.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Fuck you!</i>
Stand in line, baby.
Come on.
While I was waiting for my dog
to come back...
...we went to the Saugus Cafe
and decided to toss a few.
We were getting out,
and I get in my car, get my dog...
...we're ridin' down Lankershim Boulevard.
There are more cops on that
boulevard than in this place.
So I go down, I see the red lights
behind me and I figure:
"Well, okay, man." So I pull over.
- Cat comes up and he says...
- Okay, Marlowe, on your feet.
Keep it clean, Socrates.
Thanks a lot.
So anyway, listen, man, you know--
Get dressed, you're not comin' back here.
- You know what they got in here now?
- It's about time.
They got people that smoke marijuana.
Aren't you afraid your lips
are gonna fall off?
Possession.
Possession of noses.
Possession of gonads.
Possession of life.
It's a weird world.
Some day, all the pigs are gonna be in here
and all the people are gonna be out there.
You can bet on that.
You're not in here, it's just your body.
See you when you get out.
- Hands on the counter.
- I already said...
Philip Marlowe, over here.
- What's going on?
- Sign the card.
What is going on, please?
You're free. Isn't that good enough'?
I was free to begin with.
Anybody gonna give me an explanation
why I've been in there for three days?
- Would you tell me?
- Don't know anything.
- You know nothin'?
- Yeah.
- Lieutenant Farmer around here?
- Yeah, wait a second.
Farmer. You're just now lettin' me free.
I appreciate that.
Can you explain to me what's happening?
We just don't have any further use for you.
- I know that, but you dropped the charges.
- No, we got all our answers.
- What happened?
- Terry Lennox is dead, Marlowe.
The case is closed.
What do you mean, Terry Lennox is dead?
You're not gonna find anything in that.
Dept. Morgan, how you doin'?
What'd they pick you up for?
I just heard they were springin' you
this morning.
- Got away to get home?
- No, I don't got no way.
They have a way of bringing you,
but they don't care how you get back.
I'll give you a lift.
There's a few back issues for you.
You might be interested.
Blew his brains out in a little
godforsaken town in Mexico.
He left a full confession.
I'm readin' it.
You don't have to describe it to me, too.
I'm sorry, Marlowe.
What are you sorry about?
It's just another story to you.
- Sorry you're so stupid.
- Thanks.
There you are sittin' in the pokey...
...takin' lumps for a friend
and he lets you down.
- That's my problem, ain't it?
- Stupid, Marlowe.
There's a layout on you. Pictures and all.
I see.
This is gonna do wonders for my trade.
Otatitlan. I've heard of that.
Why would he kill himself there?
He could have done it in Tijuana.
A man at the end of his rope.
Never know what they're gonna do.
Don't say nothin' about his body.
What happened to it?
His wife's family didn't
want any part of it.
- For obvious reasons.
- Obviously.
Doesn't have any family of his own.
So he's buried in Otatitlan.
I get the picture. Case closed.
All zippered up like a big bag of shit!
Terry Lennox wasn't at the end of his rope.
The way he talked,
Sylvia wasn't dead then either.
I don't believe he killed her.
I don't believe he killed himself.
Everybody else does.
- Hi.
- Hi, Marlowe.
- Where's Herbie?
- In the can.
- Practicin' for the hit parade?
- Tryin' to learn this goddamn thing.
- Thinks it'll beef up the lunch trade.
- I don't see anybody waitin' in line.
As cheap as I work, he cannot lose.
Marlowe, haven't seen you around
for a few days.
I've been outta town.
Did you notice this?
Got a new line of sandwiches.
- Think you'll like 'em.
- You'll try anything, Herbie.
How about lunch'?
Sandwiches. Never heard of them.
No, I think I'll have a drink.
- What is it?
- CC and ginger.
- Got any messages for me?
- I believe I got a few of them there.
As a matter of fact,
you'll find my phone bill in there, too.
I wouldn't worry about that.
"It's along goodbye
"And it happens every day
"When some passerby
"Invites your eye to come her way
"Even as she smiles a quick hello"
Hello, this is Philip Marlowe.
Mrs. Roger Wade? Excuse me.
- You got a pencil on you?
- Yeah.
Mrs. Wade.
It depends on the nature of the case.
I don't do any...
...divorce work.
I understand.
Have you tried filing a missing
persons report with the police?
I guess I could work it in.
When do you wanna meet?
Yeah, it's okay with me.
You better give me your address.
The Malibu Colony.
Come on, I'm honkin' my horn,
you're supposed to get outta the way.
You want me to call a cop?
Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hello, there. What can I do for you?
I have an appointment with
Mrs. Roger Wade.
- What's her first name?
- Eileen.
What's their address?
- Jimmy Stewart?
- Right.
- Right.
- Go on in.
Thanks.
Come in.
Mrs. Wade.
It's okay, you're a nice dog.
I didn't do nothin'. Mrs. Wade.
Shit.
I'll stand here. Anything you say.
Hello.
- It's okay.
- Do come in.
I'd love to, but your friend
doesn't want me to take another step.
Come on. In the kitchen, come on.
Scoot. Will you forgive me
while I make a phone call?
Certainly.
Do sit down.
Dried apricot?
Hello. Yes, could I speak
to Mr. Lernie, please?
Hello, this is Roger Wade's secretary.
I'm terribly sorry, he's locked in his
study writing and I can't disturb him now.
I'll see that he gets your message,
and you'll hear from him in the morning.
Is that all right?
Yes.
Yes, thank you, I will. Okay.
Thank you very much. Good-bye.
That looks just like
my Thanksgiving Day dinner.
You're Philip Marlowe'?
- You don't look like your picture.
- Thank you.
- I'm Eileen Wade.
- You don't look like a secretary.
If Mr. Wade is in his library,
I don't think you need me.
My husband is not upstairs in the study.
When he disappears like this,
I try to cover up for him.
Protecting his image, I suppose.
He's done this sort of thing before?
Yes. My husband has a drinking problem.
Every so often, he reaches a stage when
he feels he needs professional help.
So he goes someplace to dry out?
- Is there some place he likes to go to'?
- Yes, but he's not there.
I've checked every single place
I could think of.
Didn't he tell you where he was going?
No. We're usually not speaking
when he leaves.
- How long's he been gone?
- A week.
A week'? Aren't you worried?
I mean, waiting a week before
you call somebody to find your husband...
What are you implying, Mr. Marlowe'?
I don't mean to be tactless but it doesn't
look like you walked into a door.
No. As a matter of fact, I didn't.
I fell out of bed.
- I'm gonna need something to start on.
- You have. He's Roger Wade.
- Roger Wade. Big writer.
- He's a big man, too.
Six-foot-five, weighs 220 pounds...
...and once you've seen his face,
you'll never forget it.
- Sounds like some kind of monster.
- Only when he drinks.
- Would you like a drink'?
- No, thank you.
- Would you like coffee?
- No, thanks. Let me get this straight.
This is different from some of the times
he behaves this way...
...but it's not different
from all the times?
That's right.
- Could you explain that to me?
- Look, I found this manuscript paper.
You see, he started out writing something,
and then he starts rambling on and on.
"Dr. V, you must help me."
Do you know a Dr. V?
I looked in the phone book under doctors.
I never knew there were so many "V's."
Could you find my husband for me, please?
- Is Roger Wade his real name?
- Why?
I figure, if it isn't his real name,
he might be using his real name.
Actually, he did change his name.
His publishers thought that Billy Joe Smith
lacked something for the books he writes.
Billy Joe Smith. Roger Wade ain't exactly
the ticket for the kind of book he writes.
His publishers are happy,
and that's all that matters.
Probably Smith's the name
that most of Doctor V's clients use.
Is that a picture of him?
I see what you mean about his face.
Does he usually walk around
in that costume?
Listen, we haven't talked about your fee.
I get $50 a day and expenses.
All right. Would you like an advance now?
No, thanks.
I prefer an itemized accounting.
So there's no misunderstanding.
- You gonna be around if I have to call you?
- <i>I'll be here.</i>
The Lennoxes, Terry and Sylvia,
they used to live up the beach.
Did you know them?
Very slightly.
Like one knows most people on the beach.
You put some ice on your bruise,
and I'll go find your husband.
- May I help you, please?
- I'm looking for a patient, Roger Wade.
There's no one here by that name.
He may not be using that name.
This is a picture of him.
- Do you recognize the face?
- There's no one that looks like that.
You look just like my great aunt Esther.
She passed on a couple of years ago.
- Is Dr. Verringer around?
- Dr. Verringer is out of town.
- Out of town?
- In Phoenix.
- Phoenix, Arizona?
- May I ask who you are?
Certainly. I'm just some guy
looking for Dr. Verringer.
Those ladies were a lot of help.
Crazy ladies.
That's okay with me.
611...
...612...
- ...613...
- Excuse me, I'm looking for--
...614...
...615...
...616...
...617...
...618...
It's okay with me, lady.
Excuse me, I'm supposed to meet
Roger Wade here and l...
Holding up that old man's pants.
I wonder what they charge him for that.
I have this book here for Roger Wade.
I'm making...
- Are you looking for someone?
- Yes. No, I'm gonna deliver this book.
- To whom are you delivering the book?
- The man who wrote it, Roger Wade.
But they told you at the office
there's no one here by that name.
- Are you Dr. Verringer?
- Good morning, Dr. Verringer.
- They told me you weren't here either.
- This is a private hospital.
I can't have strangers prowling about.
I must ask you to leave.
I hear you, Doctor.
- Tell me the nature of your business here.
- Well, I'll tell you.
If Roger Wade isn't here,
what do you care?
- Are you sure he's at Verringer's?
- Well, Verringer denied being Verringer.
He pretended he didn't know
your husband's name...
...and wouldn't even look
at his picture on the book.
I'm reasonably sure that that's the place
your husband is staying but...
...there is something
we could do to be sure.
What's that?
If you came with me, Dr. Verringer couldn't
dismiss you the same way he did me.
He'd have to answer to you.
I don't have the guts to do that.
You got the guts
to make that dog behave...
...and you don't got the guts
to talk to a jerk like Verringer?
No, it's not Verringer, it's Roger.
He doesn't want me to find him.
He doesn't want me to know
why he's hiding out there.
- What's he gonna do when I go in there?
- That's all right. You're a stranger.
He's fine with strangers, you know.
Apricot? Dried apricot?
The truth is, I didn't eat the one
you gave me this afternoon.
You know, they give me diarrhea.
What is it that you want me to do'?
I want you to make sure he's all right.
And try to bring him home if you can.
If you have any trouble, I'll back you up.
But I don't think you're afraid of trouble.
Yeah'? What makes you say that?
I looked at your picture in the paper,
and I liked what you did for my friend.
Your friend?
I mean your friend.
What am I talking about?
I like your face, too.
- I feel you're someone I can trust.
- Well, you got me, lady.
- All right, now, you have to go back.
- Come on.
- You have to go back.
- Thanks, Don.
Your favorite TV show is on.
- No, dear. Come on.
- I have to vote.
- Have you voted yet?
- Yeah.
You can handle Lucette.
Don, go to supper.
Roger, when you checked in...
...you paid me $600 cash.
Leaving a balance of $4,400.
$5,000 is my fee, Roger. You know that.
Yeah.
Exquisite Styrofoam pitcher.
Jesus, man. My mouth's burnin' up.
- You got me all drugged up, Doc.
- You need help, Roger.
I've been taking a little look
around the reservation here.
I've been lookin' at the other patients,
and some of your colleagues, and l...
This place stinks.
It's this place that's sick,
not the people in it.
- You'd like to go home, wouldn't you?
- I'd like to go home.
I'd like to go home and I'm going home.
I'll tell you one more goddamn thing.
I'm a man cannot stand confinement.
If you don't get me outta here...
...l'll tear you limb from limb
and waltz right out through the wall.
No, you won't hurt anything here.
This is my place.
- I'm here to help you.
- You're here to help me.
Just this afternoon,
a man came looking for you. Detective.
I told him you weren't here.
You don't want your wife
to know you come here.
My wife.
Of course you don't.
Here's the pen.
Here's the check.
It's all made out for $4,400.
Excuse me, I don't think it's necessary for
you to sign any check, under such pressure.
You have no right to barge in here.
I could--
You ought to be ashamed.
You could have me towed,
but why go to any trouble?
Say, wait a minute.
Who the hell are you?
I'm the private investigator
who was sent here to find you...
...but the doctor dummied up.
You were sent here to find me? Why'?
I'm supposed to bring you home,
if that's where you wanna go.
He's takin' me home.
Don't forget your checkbook, sir.
- Roger.
- Yeah'?
I want you to understand,
you'll be hearing from me again.
I'll be hearing from you.
You come by someday
and have a drink with me?
Roger? Is that you?
Here we are.
- Come on, go inside.
- Hey, Schnauzer.
- Where is Schnauzer going?
- Please, don't wake up the neighbors.
I don't wanna wake anybody up.
- Come inside, will you?
- Love me, love my dog.
Come inside, please.
Come on, go in the kitchen.
I go to my little doggie house,
and you have your nice big house.
And you've got your friend Marlboro,
the Duke of Bullshit, or whatever he is.
You go in the house,
Roger, and you go in the house, Bowzer.
Where are you?
What?
If you don't stop, I'm gonna leave you.
I really mean it.
- I just want to tell you one... You what?
- Nothing.
Nothing? Let me tell you something.
Don't talk to me about you leaving me.
I'll tell you one thing, I don't feel well.
- I wanna go to bed.
- <i>I'll take you upstairs.</i>
You crazy son of a bitch.
- You come back sometime.
- <i>I'll come back and see you.</i>
You come back. Okay?
Jesus Christ. Goddamn dog!
You and Eileen don't understand us.
He's a really sick man, you know.
More so than you might think.
He feels he's all finished as a writer...
...and he sits down and stares at
the paper, and nothing happens.
I don't know what to do.
He really needs help.
If you think your husband's suicidal,
he needs some Freudian analysis...
...or primal scream,
or I need a cigarette myself...
...but I'm not qualified
for anything like that.
I know.
Anyway, I'm very grateful
for what you've done.
You will come back again, won't you?
I'd love to, but I don't see any necessity.
Your husband's home, and I think
I've done what I'm supposed to do.
- Did you know Terry Lennox well'?
- Terry?
I knew Terry along time.
You know something?
I can't understand how
he could do something like that.
How could he kill his wife?
I mean, they were nice people.
Had the nicest heart.
I'll tell you something.
I don't believe he killed her.
I read in the paper, you know...
...he confessed,
and they had a letter from him.
Have a good night.
I'll see how everything is in the morning.
Okay, thank you again.
Ah, yes. Mammy Yokum.
I don't wanna disturb you, lady,
I'll pick up my bills later.
- Marlowe.
- Stinky.
The boss wants to talk to you.
- Yeah, who's the boss?
- Mr. Marty Augustine.
Sorry, I only see hoods by appointment.
That's supposed to be
some kind of smart crack.
Is it?
- It's the only thing I could come up with.
- Harry?
- You think it was a smart crack, Harry?
- No, sir.
Pepe?
No, Marty,
I don't think he was being smart.
- Vince'?
- No, Mr. Augustine.
Nobody thinks it was a smart crack.
What do you think, Mabel'?
Shit!
Excuse me.
Jo Ann, I'll be back in a few minutes.
You stay right here.
You can play the radio if you want.
What is that, pig? What is it?
Actually, I was on my way to the bank
to make a deposit. It's my laundry.
Vince. All right, pick him up.
All right, bring him.
You know what night this is?
This is Friday night.
<i>It's Erev Shabbos.</i>
Know where I'm supposed to be?
In Temple.
- Why aren't you there?
- 'Cause I'm talking to a smart guy like you.
- Which house do you live in?
- In that cute little place on the top.
The top? Penthouse.
How do you get up there?
- I got my own private elevator.
- Private eye with a private elevator.
You wanna pick up my mail?
Get him inside.
What is this?
It's all the new Rockettes.
They're training.
They don't got no tap shoes yet.
I can't believe what I'm lookin' at.
I see you got a Mexican,
and you got an Irish guy...
...you got a Jewish fellow,
and an Italian, right?
Do you live here?
- You pay money to live in this place'?
- Home is where the heart is, right?
Your heart is in the garbage.
Sit down. Look at the laundry.
I don't take too much starch in my collars.
All right. Find it.
Find what?
Come on.
You better get that gorilla to stop it.
And be careful with that stuff.
You know where I live?
While you live in this joint,
I live in Trousdale. Three acres.
Across the street from President Nixon.
I take tennis lessons three times
a week on my own private court.
Do you know that?
That's why I'm in
perfect physical condition.
Go ahead, smart guy, punch me
in the stomach as hard as you can.
Hey, everybody.
Go ahead.
He's gonna punch me in the belly.
I'm not gonna punch him in the stomach.
I wouldn't think of doin' that.
Maybe some other time.
Let me explain somethin' to you.
You see...
...l got a wife...
...and I got three beautiful children.
You know where my children are?
In an expensive camp on Vancouver Island.
My wife is in a health farm
where she's tryin' to lose some weight.
The Golden Door.
$1,000 a week to lose six pounds.
I got chauffeurs.
I got maids, I got butlers, I got cooks.
I live highly.
Costs me a lot of money to live that way.
I gotta have a lot of money.
I gotta have a lot of money,
so I can get a lot of money...
...so I can juice the guys I gotta juice.
And you can't take my money.
I want my money!
Why would I have anything
belonging to you?
You're very famous.
You got your picture in the paper.
Everybody knows you.
You run a Mexican taxi service.
- You made a deal with Terry Lennox.
- Big deal. Terry Lennox was my friend.
He asked me for a lift, I gave him one.
I wish I hadn't.
Your friend was a criminal.
- He murdered his wife.
- I know he didn't kill her.
I'll tell you. A minor crime,
a misdemeanor, to kill your wife.
The major crime is, he stole my money.
Your friend stole my money.
- The penalty for that is capital punishment.
- I knew it wasn't suicide.
Look, I don't give a goddamn how he died.
All I care about is $355,000 of my money...
...that he was supposed to deliver
to Mexico City.
Pepe, put down the goddamn binoculars.
- No way. It never arrived in Mexico City.
- It didn't arrive.
It was in a suitcase like this.
You know where it is, and I want it.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't expect a soul.
Don't hit me.
Open the door.
- Marty?
- Yes?
I'm sorry. I heard some noises
outside the car, and I got scared.
Can I have a Coke'?
Come here, darling.
Come over here. Sit down.
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jo Ann Eggenweiler.
This is Philip Marlowe.
Very pleased to meet you.
- Do you have a Coke'?
- In the icebox.
Harry.
Look, is that delicate? Sweet?
A little noise in the car,
give her dreams for a week.
- It was probably a squirrel.
- Marty...
I didn't drink it.
You don't want this,
somebody was drinkin' it, okay?
It's flat.
Look...
Is that a face?
That a face for a magazine cover?
Profile?
You're beautiful.
And I love you.
I do.
I sleep with a lot of girls,
but I make love to you.
Right?
The single most important
person in my life.
Next to my family.
Pepe?
All right, get her outta here.
Get her outta here!
All right, get up!
Oh, God!
Open the door!
Right!
Sit him down!
That's someone I love.
And you, I don't even like.
You have an assignment, Cheapie...
...find my money.
Don't look, Marty.
Come on!
I want you to make sure, if he comes
down here, you follow him in your car.
Can you do that? Right.
And listen, lemme tell you something.
My God!
Wait a minute! Where you goin'?
What the hell's goin' on here?
You see that guy come barrelin'
through here like--
- lt's okay, they're with me.
- With you?
What the hell?
Where did you get that Coke'?
Jack!
- Good morning, Mr. Marlowe.
- Good morning, ladies.
What?
- Do you want some yoga?
- No, I can't even touch my toes.
I know. It was really quite a night.
Can you just push a little harder?
- I don't want to hurt you.
- You won't hurt me.
- Good morning. You have a good night?
- Hey, Marlowe.
You know those girls
that live next door to you'?
You know what I think?
- I think they're a couple of lesbians.
- What makes you say that?
Look at them up there doing contortions
together, and with no clothes on.
They're just doing yoga.
- What?
- I don't know what it is, but it's yoga.
- What do they do for a living?
- They dip candles.
- What?
- They got a shop on Hollywood Boulevard.
They dip them and sell them.
I can remember when people just had jobs.
In case you lose me in traffic,
this is the address where I'm going.
- You look great.
- Thank you.
- I would straighten your tie a little.
- Yeah.
- I'm proud to have you followin' me.
- Thank you.
Nice guy.
Duty. I'm always on duty.
You're going to see the Wades?
I recognized the car.
- Hi, Cary.
- Hi.
Listen, there's this kid
who's comin' up behind me.
I think he's okay.
He's a very big fan of Walter Brennan's.
Walter Brennan? Okay. Thanks.
Walter Brennan.
I'll have to limp a little bit.
Howdy, stranger.
- Howdy, stranger. What can I do for you?
- I'm following that car.
No cars out there.
Just some sage brush
and a few covered wagons.
- You bring my boy Billy'?
- What?
Yesterday, out there
on the flat lands, he died.
I'm gonna get 'em. How was that?
- How was what?
- My imitation of Walter Brennan.
- Walter Brennan?
- Yeah, he said...
Never mind. Go ahead.
Another wise guy.
He'll see.
He'll see.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not supposed to let me
see you following me.
Now button your clothes,
be neat, and go sit in the car.
Okay-
Don't you know you're never gonna be
a first-rate hood?
Good morning.
- So you come back'?
- I hope it's not too early.
Too early? I'll tell you somethin'.
I just done six miles down that beach.
You look like you're wearing
your working clothes.
I'm wearin' my workin' clothes.
- Can I buy you a drink'?
- No, thanks. A little early for me.
- You're lookin' well.
- Feelin' fine.
I had a funny encounter last night
with Augustine.
- Did you ever hear of him?
- Yeah, mini-fart.
You writers have your
own special way of describing.
Thank you. You know why that is?
Quiet. He won't bother you. Sit down!
- Do you want a dog?
- No. I got a cat.
You got a... My wife.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I believe you know our friend,
the Marlboro Man, here.
Hello, Mr. Marlowe.
It's nice of you to come back.
- Dropped your cigarette, huh'?
- Yeah.
Say, look, did you come here
to see me or my wife?
- I just came to see how you were doing.
- I have a little idea.
I'd like to talk to my wife
for a few minutes, so maybe you'd...
...go to the beach for a bit,
and we'll call you, okay?
It's okay.
I just wanted to see how you were.
I'll be going.
Please, Mr. Marlowe.
You don't have to go. Can't you stay?
On second thought,
I guess I'll go down and count the waves.
Do that.
- Sleep well'?
- As well as ever.
As well as ever? Pills?
No.
Contessa...
...perhaps, you'd be kind enough to run into
the kitchen and get me a bottle of milk.
Milk'? Is that what you really want?
Would you say that once more?
I asked, "ls milk what you really want?"
You'd think I was drunk already,
wouldn't you?
I make a toast. To us.
God. Yeah.
That's okay.
Last night we were talkin'
about somethin' important, but I...
...for the life of me,
I can't remember what it is today.
I simply said, "If you go on drinking,
I'm going to leave you."
You're gonna leave me?
Yes.
You know, maybe you've already left me.
You've got a wall around you, baby.
And that's the same thing.
Let's stop playin' games
with each other, okay?
Until such time that you can
get into your solid-gold heart...
...that what I need is understanding...
Until you learn that,
it might just turn out that...
...l leave you.
Maybe you should.
Maybe I should.
Baby.
Jesus. Sit down.
Sit down.
I'm sorry I said that, but...
...you're the only thing I've got left,
don't you know that?
Perhaps I'm just your excuse.
Perhaps that's true but...
...l just wish I could...
Oh, God.
You know, if I could only...
...if I could just get you
to understand that...
...when a writer can't write,
it's like being impotent.
I understand what that's like, too.
<i>You do'?</i>
<i>You do'?</i>
Balls, baby! Balls!
Why don't you remember the good
we had together? The beautiful times?
I got an idea.
Why don't you call your friend, Marlboro,
in here and ask him a couple of questions?
- It's none of his business.
- None?
Do what I say.
Now, you ask him, "Marlboro...
"...when was the last time you made love,
the lighthouse at Point Venus in Tahiti?
"Or out in the lagoon?
"That shiny lagoon with the goddamn
surf boomin' in the Barrier Reef'?
"Or up on Whitney that night in a blizzard
in a double mummy bag?"
- Ask him that.
- It's none of his business.
Maybe it is.
Please, don't.
Don't. Balls!
Hey, Marlboro.
Well, there, now, Contessa, here he is.
Here's the man.
You may ask your questions, please.
Missed the son of a bitch.
You know what I wish you'd do'?
- What's that?
- I wish you'd take that JC Penney tie off.
Settle down and we're gonna have an
old-fashioned, man-to-man drinkin' party.
That's okay,
but I'm not gonna take my tie off.
Leave your tie on.
I'll tell you what I got.
I got champagne, beer, scotch, bourbon,
aquavit, honey, port, what'll you have'?
- What are you drinkin'?
- What I'm drinkin' is called aquavit.
- I'm drinkin' what you're drinkin'.
- God bless you. I like to hear that.
There's people, you say,
"What do you want to drink?"
"I want this and that,
and a twist of lemon."
Balls.
Make yourself comfortable.
- Do you mind sitting in the sun?
- No, I'll sit in the sun.
- All right. It won't hurt you.
- I know that.
Aquavit.
There you go. Jesus Christ.
- You wanna lift a toast to anything?
- Should we drink to your wife?
- I say we drink to all of us.
- Okay.
- Caraway seeds?
- Yeah, it's true.
- You've been around more than it looks.
- Just a bit.
I got to say it. I don't really want to,
in light of your profession, but...
...you've got a pretty good face.
You study faces?
You don't get to grow a face like mine
unless you know a lot about men's faces.
What about ladies' faces?
- What about ladies' faces?
- I don't know.
- Why'd you ask?
- I was just wondering.
Christ, you're a real ding-a-ling.
You're so funny.
What you say doesn't quite make sense.
- You're in a trouble with Marty Augustine?
- Yeah.
- How much you into him for?
- I don't know. I never made a bet.
- Then why are you in trouble with him?
- Don't ask me. You know him pretty good'?
The son of a bitch.
I'd hate to tell you how much
the bastard owes me.
- He owes you money?
- $50,000.
- $50,000?
- $50,000.
- Won't he pay?
- Drink up. "Won't he pay?"
If he already paid,
I wouldn't say he owed me, would I?
I guess not.
- How's your glass?
- I guess I could have a little more.
$50,000. You must run into a lotta luck.
Most guys lose their undies
when they play for those kind of stakes.
Lose their undies.
Do you know Terry Lennox?
Yeah.
I know Terry Lennox.
He's the kind of a guy that if I knew him,
I wouldn't let on I knew him.
Didn't like him much?
That son of a bitch.
Christ Almighty, I didn't know him.
I hear you.
Son of a bitch killed himself.
- I read that.
- Yeah'? Let's drink to his goin'. Shit.
You ever think about suicide?
I don't believe in it.
Did you know Sylvia Lennox?
Sylvia. A beautiful broad.
I don't know, Marlboro.
If I was your age,
I think I'd bust my ass...
...to get into some
little more dignified form of endeavor.
I'll tell you that.
Like writing?
No, I'm not talkin' about myself.
I myself made the examination...
...and signed the necessary papers.
You see, I am the coroner.
- The what? Colonel?
- No, the coroner.
Coroner.
- I'm a doctor, too, at the same time.
- I know.
Café, Doctor.
- Good for you.
- Thank you.
See...
Would you care to see some photographs?
- It's your work?
- Yes.
I noticed your camera.
You take the pictures, too?
Yes, because we have no facilities here.
We have to bring ice from the hotel.
- For drinks?
- No, for the body.
I see.
Because his death was instantaneous.
What about the gun?
Was his. Registered to his name
in the County of Los Angeles.
You know that?
Gentlemen, I appreciate all the attention
you've given me...
...and I hope I haven't
caused you inconvenience.
No, Señor Marlowe,
you were a friend of the deceased.
Of the diseased.
Let me get this straight now.
Terry Lennox came here.
He checked into a hotel.
He went up to his room and then,
an hour later, he killed himself.
That is correct.
Do you know how he got here in Otatitlan?
It's a mystery to us.
We don't know how he came.
What about his personal effects?
Everything was sent back.
But we have a list.
- You do have a list?
- Yes, we have a list.
- You make up the list?
- Yes.
You do everything.
It says here there was one bag, one valise.
He had two bags.
- It was all sent back, everything.
- But he had two bags.
Everything?
You don't know anything about the bag?
<i>No. Señor, por favor.</i>
- Shall I stand up?
- If you please.
- Is this some of your work?
- No.
- Didn't need no ice this time?
- No, the weather is all right.
You guys all right for drinks?
Come on. In the kitchen.
I'm sorry, Mr. Marlowe.
He really doesn't like you very much,
does he?
Hey, Marlboro! Do you want a dog?
Come over here, you son of a...
Come here, you bastard!
Are you sure you couldn't stay for a while?
He's getting really drunk.
Come here. I wanna have a word with you.
- I can't stay for too long.
- <i>I'll be dammed.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.
- Look at this.
Contessa, the girl. I couldn't find you.
Please, come over here
and join this little family group...
...that is growing larger by the instant.
The rest of you come over here, too,
goddamn it.
Would you like some wine?
It's a terrible thing.
I'll tell you a terrible, goddamn thing.
You know, I like you.
Suddenly you come in with my wife.
- I was looking for you everywhere.
- You were looking for me.
I was.
- You and I talked, right?
- For along time.
- And we made sense, didn't we'?
- I don't know.
No.
It's Minnie Mouse.
It's the albino tern himself.
Peter Pan. No.
The white knight.
I've forgotten your name.
I've seen you, but I don't know your name.
- Mrs. Wade, I'm Doctor Verringer.
- How do you do'?
- What? Derringer?
- Verringer.
A mini-pistol.
You know this son of a bitch?
Let me tell you a thing about him.
He is the epitome
of what's wrong with this world.
He really is, actually.
'Cause he pretends to cure people.
Can you cure people?
Roger, please.
Bullshit!
You. Why are you here?
Roger, we have business to discuss.
Balls!
- Roger...
- Listen to this asshole.
- Roger.
- What?
- Would you like to discuss this in private?
- Discuss what?
Shall we discuss our business here,
in front of all your friends?
By all means.
Why don't you go in the study
and talk about it?
I ain't got no study anymore.
I used to have a study over there, right?
You owe me $4,400 dollars.
You will pay what you owe me.
No, actually,
I don't wish to pay you what I owe you.
- I'm not leaving without the money!
- All right, don't leave.
I don't give a shit!
Get your ass out of here,
and let's have a party.
Write the check.
- What check?
- Write the check.
- What check?
- Write the check, Roger.
I'm all turned around, you know.
I mean, write the check for what?
To get outta here, right?
Okay-
Yeah, okay.
Would you all like some fresh drinks?
I'll go get some more ice.
- Don't let this break the party up.
- Okay, get out.
Get out, all of you, goddamn it!
Get out of here!
It seems this party has come
to an abrupt end.
Bumpkin time again.
- Farber Associates, Beverly Hills.
- <i>I'll remember.</i>
- I want you to call me, please.
- I'm sorry.
Okay. Yeah, I know.
- Thank you for the lovely music.
- It's my pleasure.
- That was beautiful.
- Bye-bye.
Now sign the check, Roger.
- It was my pleasure. Take care.
- Bye-bye. See you soon.
Let's do it again.
That's a good boy.
I apologize for this intrusion, Mrs. Wade.
But your husband dislikes paying his bills.
I'm sorry.
In future,
I must refuse to accept him as a patient.
We don't accept you as a doctor, quack.
Good day, Mrs. Wade.
- Gun cabinets locked?
- Certainly.
Would you mind closing that door?
It's bad enough having guns in the house.
Roger.
It's me.
Are you asleep?
Hi, Contessa.
Looney Tunes, Mr. Wade.
I'm exhausted.
Would you like something to eat?
If you got some cold baloney, mayonnaise,
and bread, I'll hang around for a while.
I can do better than that.
Come on, we'll go to the kitchen.
He'll sleep for another five or six hours.
Did your mouth ever get so dry that
you could put a cigarette out in it?
- I don't smoke.
- My mouth is really dry.
I still don't understand how you get
the butter in the chicken.
You cook the chicken,
how does the butter...
Cut the chicken, butter comes out.
How do you do that?
That's the secret about it.
It's Chicken Kiev.
Would you like some cognac?
Grand Marnier? Liqueur of some sort'?
- What are you gonna have?
- I'm going to stay with the wine.
I think I'll just have my beer outta
your wine glass, if you don't mind.
Okay-
- Have you had enough to eat?
- This is the fanciest meal I ever had.
That's nice to know.
In movies, I saw people eat like this,
but they had servants and dumbwaiters.
- You did this all by yourself?
- Sure.
- You did all this yourself?
- Yes.
- Who does the dishes?
- I do.
I am impressed.
That's nice to know.
I'll tell you, though...
Would you like coffee?
Seriously, I think you ought to consider
staying in a hotel.
Maybe you have some friends
you could spend the night with?
I did that once.
My husband smashed up
everything I owned in the house.
I found him unconscious
at the bottom of the stairs.
I'm not gonna try that again.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why don't you call me Eileen?
- Eileen.
Okay, what was Marty Augustine
doing here the other night?
- How did you know--
- I followed him here.
They dropped by to have a word with me.
I was curious to see who else
he wanted to talk to, and it was you.
Roger owed him some money.
Maybe $10,000 or something like that.
He owes Marty? You know what?
He told me Marty owed him.
You heard what Dr. Verringer said.
He hates to part with money.
What Dr. Verringer said...
A lot of people say that Terry Lennox
was working for Marty Augustine.
- I don't believe it.
- That's what I heard.
- Your husband ever talk about them?
- No.
- He ever talk about Sylvia Lennox?
- No.
Was your husband having
an affair with Sylvia Lennox?
Mr. Marlowe, I don't wish to continue
this conversation about my husband.
Was he having an affair
with somebody you didn't know...
...who might have been Sylvia Lennox?
Definitely not.
Where was your husband
the night Sylvia Lennox was killed?
Okay, come on. Here, take my tie.
<i>Rogen!</i>
Roger! God.
What brought your attention over here?
We were standing out
by the porch drinking...
...and having a party over at our place.
You saw him at the beach but you never
talked to him in the morning?
- But you knew his wife?
- We didn't see the body.
Was he chasing her,
or was she chasing him?
Lieutenant Farmer.
How do you know'? Just a minute.
What we have is an apparent suicide.
We haven't found the body yet.
Let's just not get into
the witnesses right now.
We could see it from the porch.
It was right there.
And then what happened after
the screaming and the persons running in?
You'll find on a number of occasions...
I think he had been under
some kind of psychiatric care.
Question, don't you know'?
Answer, he kept...
Mrs. Wade, is this list of witnesses...
...to your husband's behavior
at the party substantially correct?
Absolutely. Everybody is here.
Everybody is here having a party now.
Everybody's drunk.
Your husband was upset
over Dr. Verringer's visit?
He threw everybody out of the house?
Passed out, left you alone with Marlowe'?
No. I asked Mr. Marlowe to stay.
And there was no more
definite motive you can think of...
- ...for killing himself?
- Why don't you just go'?
You go get a couple of sand crabs
and stick 'em up your nose.
Disappear, go take a leak or something.
You go join him.
Listen, will you go upstairs
and tweeze your eyebrows?
Just go back or something!
Eileen...
...are you lying about Roger?
Your crazy, Looney-Tune husband
could have killed Sylvia Lennox.
Could've killed Sylvia Lennox.
Look.
He's not gonna walk outta there.
I'm sorry. I thought the guy was okay.
I never saw one like him before, but now...
Police say that Terry Lennox killed his wife.
Now, you tell me what really happened!
What really happened?
Look, Terry Lennox is dead.
I wanna know who killed him,
because that guy is dead, right?
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened now?
He killed Sylvia, I think. I don't know.
You think he killed Sylvia Lennox?
Did you just say that you think
that your husband killed Sylvia Lennox?
You said to me just now that you think...
Are you telling me the truth?
Is that what you think?
I couldn't tell anybody.
Roger had an affair with Sylvia,
and Terry found out.
And Sylvia wanted to break it off.
And Roger was jealous.
And Roger went to see her,
and then she was dead.
And then I read in the paper
that Terry confessed.
And I don't know what to think.
I don't know.
You don't know what to think?
Well, I know what to think.
I know what to do,
and I know what to think.
Hey, Farmer.
I want you to open up
the Terry Lennox case.
I've got new information.
I have fresh evidence now
for you to reopen the Terry Lennox case.
The lady down there is prepared
to give evidence that her husband...
...was sleeping with Sylvia Lennox
the night that she was killed.
I had my ass busted for three days because
you said my friend killed Sylvia Lennox.
And her crazy--
We know that Roger Wade
saw Sylvia Lennox that afternoon.
We know what time he left her.
He went directly from the Lennox house
to Verringer's clinic.
You knew all the time?
He was in sedation
at the time she was killed.
- You knew all the time?
- Will you do me a favor'?
Go back to your gumshoes
and your transom-peeping and let us alone!
- You want me to let you alone?
- That's right, baby. Let us alone!
You never were a baby, man,
you son of a bitch.
You're gonna get everything
straightened out. I saw that.
That man walking into the ocean
gave Dr. whatever-his-name-is...
...$5,000 for an alibi,
so you can keep your job?
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm calling Ronald Reagan.
I'm getting you kicked your ass off.
You're gonna be selling bus tickets.
You son of a bitch!
Terry Lennox was my friend,
you motherfuckers!
You knew what you were doing
all the time.
You don't deserve to be alive,
you fuckin' pigs!
"It's along goodbye
"And it happens every day"
Marlowe.
How nice to see you.
It's wonderful and cooperative of you
to come over.
I must say, I never mind cooperating,
especially if I don't have a choice.
I think all the boys should sit down.
You just stand here. You remember Harry?
And you know Pepe at the bar.
Vince. And, of course,
you know Jack really well.
What about the lady you gave
a Coke bottle to for her nose?
Is she still walking around?
That's supposed to be
some kind of smart remark'?
No, don't misunderstand me.
I didn't mean nothin' smart by it.
He doesn't think I'm smart.
Nobody's laughin'. Didn't we do this?
We did, but I'm glad
you asked me about Jo Ann.
- Vince, be so kind.
- Yes, sir.
See, what we have here
is a problem in communication.
I knew it from the beginning.
I don't hear from you.
I don't get a phone call.
Not so much as a postcard.
What's the matter? Where's the money?
I don't got it. That's the truth.
Jo Ann.
Come here.
You remember Philip Marlowe'?
- Okay, I get the point.
- You don't get the point.
I get the point.
You don't. The point is money!
You tell me where the money is!
- I don't know where your money is!
- I don't like getting excited.
I really don't like it.
Getup! Up!
Here.
Sit down.
You remember the night that...
...Jo Ann became ill
and we had to take her to the hospital?
Well, as you can see,
she's had extensive treatment.
Finest surgeons.
Had nurses around the clock.
Best attention.
Because, as you know, she's...
...very near and dear to me.
And the prognosis is excellent.
Excellent. She's gonna be fine.
Now...
...l left the hospital that night...
...and I was...
...really upset. What was I?
Haunted.
- What?
- Haunted.
That's it. Haunted. I was haunted.
Absolutely haunted with the idea that
somehow I'd not been fair to her.
No matter how much I would go over it,
I realized I had not been fair.
What do you want? Sit down.
Over there. Far away.
And what had she done'?
Absolutely nothing!
You were the one I was angry with.
I was taking out on her
what I should have been givin' you!
I knew at that moment
that I had to apologize.
I had to apologize in a very special way.
It had to be total and it had to be honest.
After all, I had caused the girl
considerable discomfort.
I went to the hospital.
I went to her room, nobody was there.
It was dark, I took off all my clothes.
I undressed completely
and stood before her totally naked.
And I said to her, "Jo Ann, I apologize.
"You see a man standing here
with nothing to hide."
- Is that right?
- Yes, Marty.
- So, what do you want me to do'?
- I want you to take off your clothes.
I'm gonna tell you somethin'.
I have nothing to hide,
but I'm not gonna take my clothes off.
I want you to tell me the truth
about my money.
- You wanna take yours off?
- Would you like me to'?
- It's okay.
- It's a pleasure.
As a matter of fact,
everybody take off their clothes.
I don't wanna take off my clothes,
I have too many scars.
I understand. Go inside, Pepe,
and take care of the telephone.
Meantime,
everybody takes off their clothes.
Take off your clothes.
- Take them off.
- George Raft never took his off.
Help him take off his clothes.
Wait, one second. I don't need any help.
Jo Ann, I want you to wait right here.
I'd like you to see what goes on.
This is what I owe you.
I owe you this much.
I understand you're nervous.
- I'm not nervous.
- You're nervous like I was.
When I was a kid, I was in high school,
I used to dread gym class.
You know why? I didn't have any
pubic hair until I was 15 years old.
You must've looked like
one of the Three Little Pigs.
- It ain't funny.
- Take it easy.
- I'm just making a joke.
- See? Look, it's very simple.
Just a minute. Look at this.
What's that?
Picture of James Madison.
- It's a $5,000 bill.
- I know.
See? You take off your clothes,
everything comes out honest.
- How many are there in this country?
- Couple.
Very few.
Three of them were in the suitcase...
...that Terry Lennox was supposed
to take for me to Mexico.
- Where'd you get this?
- Box of Crackerjacks, the prize.
Bullshit. Where did you get it?
I'll tell you...
- A client sent it to me.
- A client? That's bullshit!
Are you laughing at me? You're laughing.
I see you. I wouldn't laugh if I were you.
- I'm not laughing.
- Is Terry Lennox alive'?
Did you have a deal with Terry Lennox?
- You think it's funny'?
- No.
Funny to steal $355,000
from Marty Augustine?
Jack, let me see that knife.
- With pleasure, Marty.
- Give it to me.
Harry?
Your father was immoral.
Cut him.
- What?
- Cut him!
- Where'?
- Cut it off.
- Cut "it" off?
- That's what I said, "Cut it off!"
Marty, come here,
I gotta tell you something.
Can't you see I'm busy?
Why do you come and disturb us?
Marty, this is important, come on.
Excuse me, will you, please? What is it?
Everybody out.
- Jack, bring me my clothes.
- Right, Marty.
- What about our wallets?
- Never mind the wallets.
Harry, shut up.
What's the matter with you?
It's a lot of entertainment for $5,000.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
It's okay with me.
Hey.
Where you going?
I had a terrific time, but I'm going home.
Here.
Why don't you keep this for your trouble?
You told the truth,
and I admire that in a man.
- If you're in the neighborhood, stop by.
- Thanks a lot.
Especially since my fairy godmother
dropped your $350,000 back in your lap.
Hey! Mrs. Wade!
Come on!
Pull over!
Shit.
Right.
Chasing after that car,
I got hit by a car and I'm at the hospital.
Gotta get outta here.
Gotta get out of this place fast.
Nothing broke.
Okay-
You're gonna be okay.
I seen all your pictures, too.
Hey.
Yeah, I gotta get outta here.
You listen. You tell that guy
that it don't hurt to die.
You know,
that's the smallest one I ever seen.
You know, listen, I can't.
I got a tin ear, you know.
Here you go.
- It's for me?
- Yeah.
Okay, I'll practice. See you later.
You shouldn't be out of bed, Mr. Marlowe.
I'm not Mr. Marlowe.
This is him right here.
How long has he been in here?
I don't know. I've been off for three days.
- Yeah'? What's wrong'?
- I've had the flu.
Don't breathe in his mouth.
Don't spill that. Take care of him.
- He's important.
- Are you checking in?
Out.
Hey, Charlie, gimme a hand
with this swing back, will you?
You're helpless. You can't do anything.
I'm dropping it, Charlie.
Well, here's a real bird's nest.
Fake bird, and don't forget the--
Excuse me ladies, I'm looking for Mrs.--
Mrs. Tooksbury is upstairs.
She's the lady in charge.
Mr. Katz, I'm Sybil Tooksbury.
How are you? It's so good to see you.
You're an hour early,
and I was getting this stuff cleaned out...
...so you could see the house
as really it should look.
I'm looking for the lady who lives here.
- The lady who lives here.
- Mrs.Wade. Yeah.
I'm not your Mr. Katz.
You're not Mr... Who are you?
Marlowe's my name.
I'm looking for Mrs. Wade.
- You're not Mr. Katz?
- No.
I'm sorry, I can't give
you any information.
I work for Surfside Realty. Call them.
They're in Santa Monica.
They'll give you any information
you'd like. Excuse me, I'm very busy.
Mrs. Tooks...
Whoever you are, ma'am,
I wanna find Mrs. Eileen Wade.
That's who I'm looking for. Where is she?
Mrs. Wade? She's gone to Europe.
I don't know. I'm not allowed to tell you.
I'm sorry, sir. You'll just have
to call the real estate office.
Ladies, it's okay with me.
Good-bye, Mr. Katz. Nice to have met you.
We're dancing in the sand.
Our bodies are in ecstasy.
Pristine colors are
the most beautiful colors.
Just imagine that we are holding hands...
...because we're one.
And our breasts become full.
And our arms become free...
...and our bodies become free,
and we are now beautiful.
We are now beautiful, and we are now one.
- Nothing...
- Hi, girls.
Have you seen my cat?
The other day he ran away and...
...I'm leaving town for a couple of days,
I'd appreciate it, if he shows up...
...if you could look after him
or give him a bowl of milk.
They're not even there.
It's okay with me.
A melon convention.
Our breast is full.
Our bodies warm.
We hear music. Dance to the music.
Senor Marlowe, I want to show you our town.
It's a beautiful town and you have
a lot of beautiful people in it.
I don't wanna go sightseeing. There's a
few things I'd like to get straight.
Maybe it is better if we talk inside?
I think it would be better
if we talk in the car.
This is the largest police car I've
ever seen. Like a gold chariot.
Very nice, Señor Marlowe,
but I think I have to change the scenery.
Señor Marlowe, we're fixing the
roads and all those things.
- New streets...
- And new schools, too.
Trying to build a new school.
I know how civic-minded you are.
But I've come for the truth.
- The truth?
- Yeah, the truth about Terry Lennox.
He's dead. You saw the--
I know you told me a good story,
and I saw some pretty good pictures...
...of a guy who looked dead,
but the truth is coming together now.
- Who told you?
- I'm prepared to make a donation...
...to the people of this town,
and since you're their representatives...
...l can tell you that
I'm prepared, right now...
...to give you a James Madison.
- James Madison.
- James Madison.
A grand, grand president. Yeah.
Do you think you can bribe us?
Bribe? No. Please, no.
This is charity I'm talking about.
- You can buy a lot of cobblestones.
- Well, yes.
A little light shone on the matter.
I'll tell you what happened.
- The suicide was a fake, of course.
- Absolutely right.
Yeah. Look, the doctor...
See, I put the injections so it looked
like he was dead, you know'?
And I put the gun to his head,
and I told him, you know...
...that it wouldn't harm him.
Then we took him in the coffin...
Took the pictures with the eyes.
It looked perfect. Yes.
We buried the coffin
loaded with stones, you know.
Mr. Lennox is also a charitable man,
what did he...
Just a Madison.
- So you know James Madison?
- We met him for the first time, yes.
Señor Lennox is still alive,
and well, Señor Marlowe.
How you doin', Terry?
Marlowe'?
I guess if anybody's gonna track me down,
it'd be you.
- Want a drink or something?
- No, I don't want no drink.
Did you get a kick
out of that Madison I sent you?
Yeah, I got a big kick out of it.
So you murdered your wife, Terry?
Well, I killed her,
but you can't call it murder.
Wade told her about Eileen and me,
she started screaming.
She was gonna tell the cops.
She knew I was carrying money
for Augustine.
She was gonna turn me in.
I hit her.
I didn't try to kill her, I hit her.
I didn't mean it.
I saw the photographs, boy.
You bashed her face in.
She didn't give me any choice.
You didn't have much choice.
So you used me.
Hell, that's what friends are for,
I was in a jam.
Come on, have a drink.
I had a dead wife.
$350,000 that doesn't belong to me.
I had to get out. It's as simple as that.
- Simple as that?
- Goddamn simple.
Cops had me legally dead.
Augustine's got his money.
He's not lookin' for me anymore.
I got a girl that loves me.
She's got more money than Sylvia
and Augustine put together.
What the hell? Nobody cares.
Yeah.
Nobody cares but me.
Well, that's you, Marlowe.
You'll never learn. You're a born loser.
Yeah, I even lost my cat.
