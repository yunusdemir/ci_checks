- How will you kill me this time?
- I will cut your throat.
Hello?
Hello, Central Police?
Why don't they answer? Are they sleeping?
There has been a crime.
Yes, there has been a crime.
Via del Tempio, 1.
Not Via del Tempo, idiot!
Via del Tempio!
Augusta Terzi. Appartment 1.
Have you understood? Did you make a note?
Repeat it.
Please.
- Please.
- Please.
- One moment!
Best wishes, doctor!
Best wishes, doctor.
He gave the correct address!
We could use a man like him.
The political situation is favorable.
No worries, doctor.
Piantone, get me fifteen glasses.
- What's happening?
- Doctor, there has been a homicide.
- "Via del Tempo, 1."
- Tempio.
"Mrs. Augusta Terzi."
- When did they phone?
- Ten or twenty minutes ago.
- Ten or twenty minutes?
- I don't know, they did not specify.
It is essential to be precise.
We have checked road and name. I'm
about to leave.
You are giving the suspects a chance
to create an alibi.
They will understand that we are no
longer there.
"Agent shoots." Who is he?
I don't know him.
- He fired by mistake, of course.
- That is the more probable version.
Go to Via del Tempio.
Congratulations.
You should be happy! Why the sad face?
Be quiet. Her child will be out of jail in ten years!
I am no longer responsible.
I have finished!
Lamantia, Lo Cascio, Mangiaracina, Terrè!
Let's go!
Finally you are getting rid of me! Let's go.
Panunzio! Let's open a bottle for Doctor Panunzio.
- Here you are.
- Best wishes, doctor!
You come with me.
- Doctor Mangani!
- You will come with me, do you understand?
Congratulations! It will be
difficult for me to replace you.
No! What are you saying?
- Where is Doctor Panunzio?
- He is there.
I am here.
Doctor Panunzio!
Did Proietti confess yet?
- He says it was suicide.
- He will confess. Let's drink!
- The Champagne will clear his thoughts.
- I am innocent!
- Of course.
- She was killed to frame me.
Perhaps she lost balance, and twisted her neck.
I don't know!
- You threw her downstairs.
- No, I was asleep...
...just as you found me!
I am a violent person.
I would have strangled that bitch!
Drink, innocent one.
Drink! We are all innocent here.
In here the only guilty one...
...is me!
Quiet.
I don't want to praise an outstanding colleague
that is even my brotherly friend.
However, no one deserves a
promotion more than  you.
In these years we have had
102 cases of homicide.
Only ten remain unsolved.
At this difficult time, with you in
the Security Division...
...they will become as efficient
as the Homicide Division.
I wish for you to have the same success.
I lift the glass...
...and I toast to your health and to your career!
- Health! Health!
Enough of this praise.
- This isn't the Carnival season.
Confirmed. Via del Tempio, 1.
Confirmed. Via del Tempio, 1.
Mangani, Panunzio! Let's go.
I'll catch up with you.
Hello, have you anything
to say to me?
- It's the the husband.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- These are cutouts from a black chronicle.
There is even a photograph of yours.
Look.
- Where is the body?
- Over here.
Let me see her.
- Have you seen this?
- It's an empty jewel case.
- This money?
- 300.000 liras in cash.
Libertine,  D'Annunzio style.
We have found no underwear
in the appartment.
- Nor any pants.
- It's disorderly.
They went to bed together,
to make love.
- Any traces of orgasm?
- No.
Cover up.
Pick up that bottle and glass.
Have the tenants seen anything?
We are collecting the names.
Are you feeling ill?
- Who lives there?
- A famous surgeon.
An individual above any suspicion.
Who owns the appartment?
The victim.
- Does the husband inherit everything?
- They were separated three years ago.
Bring him in and question him.
Look here.
The black chronicle has photographs
of the victim posing.
There is a whole collection here.
In my opinion, the work of a dilettante,
even childish. Do you agree?
Thrown on the bed. Turned over.
I'll show you how we found that trollop.
No!
- Come with me.
- Where?
A German hostess made love to a
Turk on an intercontinental flight.
We found her strangled in the restroom of
Fiumicino Airport. Lie still!
- Now, what do you want to do?
- The young singer.
Yes. Parioli, 1967.
The young singer ends up strangled,
and covered by tiny scratches.
Covered by disks of sacred polyphonic
music, it was a mystical erotic crime.
The murderer is an ex seminarist.
They find him a few minutes later...
...listening to the voice of the
victim on a juke-box.
- He's an organist.
- Don't move.
Shall we do the one with
the revolutionary youth?
A young revolutionary student girl
is suffocated...
...by an ordinary of Sociology,
with 10.000 lira bills.
She is violated afterwards.
Still!
- wide legs, don't move.
- Damn!
- Thats it!
- Does it excite you to find them like that?
Yes, I am excited by a certain detail.
An appliance.
- Which appliance?
- No, I'm ashamed to say.
Let me through.
- Doctor.
- What is it?
- In my opinion he is an idiot.
- Who?
- The murderer.
- Why is he an idiot?
He is an idiot, superficial and conceited.
He has taken the jewels to pretend a robbery,
but leaves the 300.000 liras behind.
He then washes and gets dressed,
using the victim's French soap.
- Then?
- He has walked on the blood...
...leaving tracks everywhere.
For us these are important clues.
He is an idiot.
Don't you agree?
He's an idiot.
Let's hope she was killed by the husband,
so that it doesn't drag on.
- Then?
- Naked!
- Has she been violated?
- No, she's been making love.
Then she was killed.
There are no signs of violence.
Write: There is a morbid, D'Annunzio-style
atmosphere inside. There is a lot of blood.
Leave, leave. I'm driving.
The victim had a beautiful body?
She had the velvety skin of a
courtesan of this low empire.
Tell your readers there
is no underwear inside.
- Fetishism?
- No, she didn't wear them.
- Excellent! I will write it in the title.
- Patanè, do me a favour.
- Insist on the husband.
- All right.
Commissary!
Don't you know me?
Am I speaking to the chief of the
Department of Homicide?
You have never seen me.
Do you meet police officers?
Who is?
I could be a thief.
A maniac, a murderer.
One of the thirty murderers
that roam free in city.
Do you want to know my name?
Find out yourself, be brave.
You let yourself be photographed,
you release interviews.
By the way, try to
loose some weight.
Commissary, help!
Somebody is trying to get inside
my house, I can hear his footsteps.
For months I've been receiving threats,
letters and anonymous phonecalls.
Somebody wants to hurt me.
See! He doesn't wear pants!
What horror!
I am alone and naked.
I'll be violated, it's my destiny.
Help!
You always wear dark suits, as if in mourning.
Have no illusions, physically you do
not interest me.
You have the shape of an average Italian,
and too much hair.
You sweat a lot. You smell like shoe polish...
...as do all police officers.
I'm telling you the truth.
A police officer has a lot of
secrets,  like a priest.
His mind excites me, I admire the police.
I am a confident aspirant.
I would do anything to
be interrogated by you.
Ask it to that whore sister of yours!
Who's there?
Police.
You can be only a thief or a policeman.
- Who has been here?
- A man.
Who is he? What did he want?
Why did you phone me?
I tell him at once, I don't
spend money on women.
How charming!
You should be calling the uniformed police,
not the Homicide Department.
- What's your opinion of me?
- What's your point?
To amuse myself.
How did you come to know all these millionaires?
Always on the phone, right?
I must say, you are a good policeman!
However, there is an error here.
In '66 I was single.
Like a dog.
On your feet!
Toruzzo, how are you?
How are you? Gentlemen, I hope
you appreciate the new situation.
We are all reunited here...
...american style!
We're too few for the work
that needs to be done
- that's right.
- We need more people. Sit down.
From today of, I take over
as head of the Security Department.
Until yesterday I was busy with
murders, with success.
There is a precise reason why
they have chosen me...
...at this time to lead the Security Department.
It is because the political
and the non-political crimes...
...are by now nearly indistinguishable.
Remember this well.
Underneath every criminal hides
a subversive person.
Underneath every subversive individual
there hides a criminal.
In the city under our control...
...subversives and criminals have already
spun their invisible web...
...that we have to destroy.
What is the difference between a
gang that robs a bank...
...and organized subversion,
legalized and institutionalized?
None. They have the same objective...
...even if they use different methods.
They want upset the social order.
6.000 filed prostitutes, an
increase of 20% in strikes and..
...house occupations, 2.000 brothels.
In one year, thirty attacks on state property...
...and 200 cases of rape.
50.000 middle school students demonstrating.
An increase of 30% in bank robberies.
An estimated 10.000 subversives
and 600 filed homosexuals.
70 groups of subversive youths gathering
outside the parliament.
Fraudulent bankruptcies increased by 50%.
There are a lot of political magazines that encourage this revolt!
Use of freedom is a constant threat to the traditional powers...
...and the constituted authorities.
Use of freedom makes any citizen a judge...
...and prevents the free use of our functions!
We defend the law...
...which has to be unchangeable
and engraved in time!
The people is underage, the city is sick.
Others have the task of
educating and curing this.
We have the duty to repress it!
Repression is our vaccine!
Repression and civilization!
- Well done!.
- Compliments, doctor!
Bravo, doctor!
Do not applaud me,
I'm a modest man.
Let's get to work.
Well done!
Here there are Communist, Partisan,
Trotskyists, Maoist and Anarchists.
- The government parties?
- Over here.
Here are the Catholic files, after that the Social democrats...
...and the opposition to the right.
As we progress, this will be destroyed...
...what remains will put in two
little rooms. Let's go to this part.
Hey, come here.
I'd like to see what's issued from my
colleagues in the homicide department.
Of course.
For two weeks they have been transmitting
data of their practices to the archive.
This is the true progress.
- Let's do a test.
- All right.
We imagine that the Terzi murder
has a political background.
- What is the address?
- Via del Tempio, 1.  It's in the city centre.
We ask the regulator if, in Via del Tempio...
...there are socially and politically
dangerous individuals.
- What does it show?
- This.
What is happening? The revolution
from America has arrived!
In Via del Tempio, 1 lives a man...
...reported to be socially and
politically dangerous.
Pace, Antonio.
Born in Ravenna March 24th, 1946.
Studies chemistry.
Member of the counsel of faculty.
Subversive, fanatical, dangerous.
- Is he under telephone surveillance?
- Certainly, doctor.
From May 1968.
Of course it is authorized.
He has the face from criminal!
I'll send him to prison.
Doctor, please come inside.
Goodbye.
- Reverend...
- Son, it is better not to.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello. Do you want a cigar?
- Yes, thanks.
Take one. Please sit down.
Well, are you satisfied?
In 1917, in Caporetto, the responsibility
was put on general Cadorna.
This coalition between centre and
left-wing parties becomes the Caporetto...
...which governs.
There is a lot of tension in the country.
I would be more comfortable with
a larger organization.
I need a hundred more men, and funds
to pay the informants.
I will speak to the minister.
- I would want...
- I hear you.
- Would want...
- Speak.
- Listen.
- Yes.
I would like you to rent three
apartments in a calm area like Prati...
...for my confidents.
I want to establish a more confidential
contact with them.
Agreed.
However, officially I don't know anything.
My office has prepared a list of 630 persons...
...to  put under
telephone surveillance.
Will you make an authorization?
Certainly.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
- The lady who was killed three days ago...
- Mrs. Terzi?
Yes, Augusta Terzi.
She was a beautiful woman,
I have seen the photoes.
I knew her.
Yes, I had a relationship with her.
And so?
In short...
I wanted ask you if you think it necessary...
...to  inform the enquirers of this circumstance.
I don't know.
What do you think?
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I don't know...
In my opinion, she was killed
by the husband.
Goodbye.
Bring in Panunzio.
Good morning, doctor.
I have brought you a souvenir photo,
of the glorious Homicide Department.
Take a seat.
I know, my cousin is a communist.
He is the secretary of a labor union,
but what can I do about it?
He never comes to my home,
I never see him.
In fact I do see him, but
only at one time each year.
at Christmas.
Doctor, in two years I retire.
Do not transfer me.
I have two kids who study,
I have to check on them often.
How are investigations on
the Terzi murder going?
We have a good lead.
Under the fingernails the forensic investigator
has found a fibre of blue silk...
...torn from a tie.
- The murderer was naked?
- Yes.
According to you, he was
naked with a tie?
That's true, nobody had thought of it.
Panunzio!
Panunzio!
Have you questioned the husband?
Yes, doctor.
We are questioning him from tonight.
- Fingerprints?
- None of interest.
- Doctor, there are only yours.
- Mine?
- My imprints?
- Yes, on a handle.
Panunzio!
And even on a cup of coffee.
Perhaps you were sleepy.
These imprints were in the shower.
All are entered here...
...even Doctor Mangani.
Your imprints were even in the kitchen.
Even those are all entered here.
Perhaps you were distracted, and touched
something without taking precautions.
There were the your imprints
even on the telephone.
However certainly that evening
you used the phone.
I remember well that you phoned.
We have found your imprints
on a glass of liqueur.
that evening you felt ill...
...and I poured you a glass
of Fernet. Remember?
I have it written down in a notebook.
Feeling bad?
Are you a man or a woman?
When did you begin your
homosexual practices?
Before or after the separation
from Augusta Terzi?
- Why did your wife kick you out?
- You gave her everything!
- She threw the money in the garden!
- It is not that simple, you are mistaken.
We were fond of each other!
He is destroyed. Two or three more
questions and he will confess all.
Artist, hippy, " fennel "! Want to confess?
It fits together, we know all about you.
It is only logical! You're a 'fennel',
she was beautiful, and you killed her.
- It is not true!
- Calm yourself.
- I want my lawyer!
- We are not in America.
When he changes the code, call him.
You're an artist, a sensitive person.
Try to help yourself.
Sure, I will help.
I will say it all calmly.
Start again.
At what time did you return from Fregene
on the Sunday of the homicide?
- I have said it.
- Repeat it.
At 4 o'clock. Then I took the car
and left for Rome.
There was a large crowd of people.
Thousands! It was fabulous!
I know, seems improbable.
- He is a "poof" indeed!
The crowd is an alibi!
I have told you all that I know!
You have not said it all.
You have not spoken spontaneously.
You have used your wife to do career!
She said so to one of your colleagues!
I will succeed waking you up.
Question me, don't sleep.
- Leave me alone.
- I like it when you question me.
You are very suspicious,
just like my father.
Come on, question me!
Get out of bed.
Get out of bed and on your knees. Sit straight!
Straight!
I understand, silence always invokes fear.
Straighten up!
Imagine waiting terrible hours...
...cruel questions, deception, extortion.
You'll remember parts of your life
you have forgotten about.
You'll remember the shameful
images from your life.
You'll be thinking, I am
able to know all about you.
The state provides all means
necessary to know an individual.
- Straight!
- Pig.
I will convince you, I know all about you.
To provoke a complex of guilt.
I am tired.
Interrogate me, give me the questions.
- You want the questions do you?
- Yes.
Then speak.
Tell me the more shameful things.
Confesses your weakness
and little daily shames.
- Only then will I forgive you.
- I understand.
You treat them as children.
All return to being children, when confronted
with the established authority.
I represent the power.
Straight! The law.
Straight!
The law.
All laws known and unknown.
The suspect returns to being a child.
I become the father.
It's an unattackable model. I assume
the position of God and of the conscience.
It's a setup to discover
secret and profound feelings.
Don't shiver, take this.
I want to explain to you a mental condition.
The  authority is grounded on these foundations.
University teachers...
Party executives, tax solicitors, station masters.
Come, I'll show you how we found
the whore of Mandrione.
In the end we police officers
take on resemblance to the criminals...
...their words and habits.
At times even their gestures.
You're like a child, more so than
other men I have known.
You must not say...
...I am a child.
You must not say it, understood?
The others are children.
Stop talking about the crowd! Wait.
We leave you to think things over.
Think well  about to what to say and do.
Let's go away.
- Mangani, you're always shouting.
- I have learned it from you.
- He is always interfering.
- He has reasons, doctor.
He hampers the investigations.
Prick!
Drink some coffee.
- You have furnished the Moroni house.
- Yes.
There are some interesting solutions
in the Art Nouveau style, right?
Mr. Terzi, when did you
see Augusta the last time?
Three days before her death.
I was being threatened.
I have often received anonymous
phonecalls from a man.
- From him.
- Who?
My wife's lover. They were in
agreement, he phoned me.
He used the tone of someone
accustomed to command.
- Why did they threaten you?
- They loved to see me suffer.
They wanted to humiliate me.
What was the form of these threats?
He once said on the phone that he
would have me filed...
...as a transvestite
I was thinking he must be an important man.
Perhaps a military...
...or an agent of the economic
crimes department of the police.
Augusta loved powerful men.
- What is the name of this man?
- I don't know.
If I knew it, I would not be here.
In my opinion he is the murderer.
I have a feeling he is.
- So you have forgotten his name?
- No, I have never known it.
Stay calm, it will all end well.
Thank you.
Well?
To me he is innocent!
For me he is innocent.
"At 16:00 on Sunday 24th of August..."
"...I have killed Mrs. Augusta Terzi..."
"...with cold determination."
- Determination.
" I have only one weak spot.
The victim is always playing..."
Games with me.
- " I have left clues everywhere..."
- Clues.
- " not to mislead..."
- Not to mislead the investigations!
- " but to try out..."
- To try out...
Not to mislead the investigations!
- " but to try out..."
- To try out. To try out!
- To try out.
- "To try out."
- To try out.
- " my..."
My being above suspicion!
Still...
Still...
When you condemned an innocent
to take your place...
...your...
Your being above suspicion...
...was not proven.
1,2 kilograms.
900 liras.
Does this package go to the
police headquarters?
It's written there, isn't it?
Hello? I would like to speak to
Patanè of the Cronaca.
- Cronaca.
- Hello, Patanè?
- Who's speaking?
- I cannot say my name.
- Your telephone is monitored.
- Is this a joke?
It will arrive at the
department of homicide a package...
...with the jewels of Augusta Terzi,
a shoe of the assassin...
...and a razorblade.
- This excludes the husband.
- You are not camouflaging your voice.
I have recognized you.
2.000 written praises to Stalin
were removed in 1948...
...50 to Lenin and 1.000 to Togliatti.
- 30 to Tito.
- 300 to the leader.
- 411 to the ordinary man.
In 1956 hovever, there were
only a hundred writings for Stalin.
- That is an enormous decrease.
- Togliatti?
Unchanged.
In 1958 there were about one hundred
writings for Krutchev, 50 for Mao Tse Tung...
...and 500 writings against Stalin.
Obviously, on orders from above
these were not removed
Last year there were 3.000 writings for
Mao, 10.000 for Ho Chi Minh...
...1.000 for Che Guevara and eleven for Marcuse.
- Some writings for a certain Sade.
- The marquis!
This year we anticipate 10.000 writings
for Mao, 500 for Trotsky...
...about ten in favour of Amendola
and about 500 for Stalin.
What are they up to?
Go to check on them,
and see where they go.
The youth!
They write on the walls!
Young students and young
workers go turns at night!
They speak of revolution on the phone,
in the faculty and in the departments!
Use tons of red paint to insult.
I know what I would give them!
Your squadron of paint removers is not enough...
...to discourage this subversive bunch!
- Pace is in the homicide department.
- Who is he speaking to?
With Mangani.
Our youth make connections
when they return to school.
They will go to the university
and in the factories with their long hair.
Wearing overalls stained with fat.
We have to know and check everyone.
We will use even our own children!
Good morning.
"I guarantee that Mao doesn't want the war."
- Good morning, doctor.
- The interception of Antonio Pace.
At once.
There is important news on the Terzi case.
I will inform you.
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning.
Doctor, sign here.
Thank you.
"Antonio, what did you say?"
- "To the security office of the Police"
- "Start again?"
"No, they called me in because of the
woman who was murdered in my building."
- "They have involved you?"
- "They asked me if I knew anything."
- "So what did you say?"
- "Nothing."
- "Did they know you two had a relationship?"
- Pig.
"Stop, we are controlled."
"I want to speak to the sergeant
of the interceptions."
"Sergeant companion, you are spying
on the birth of the Italian revolution."
"Even you are being exploited,
you're a child of the people!"
"Unite with us or ask for a rise of salary!"
Turn it off.
Wait, doctor. The ideas are wrong,
except the last sentence.
After thirty years of service, I still
make only 140.000 liras each month.
- And so?
- The culture helps me.
- How?
- I sell books at rates.
This is of no interest to me, I will report this!
Doctor.
"I would like to speak to Patanè of the Cronaca."
- "Cronaca, who's speaking?"
- "I cannot say my name."
"- Your telephone is monitored.
- Is this a joke?"
"It will arrive at the
department of homicide a package..."
"...with the jewels of Augusta Terzi..."
- What do you think of this?
- " The shoe of the assassin..."
- One is Patanè.
- Who is the other?
Have you received the package?
Yes, besides that this notice
was given an hour ago.
That means it can't be the husband,
because he is here with us.
It may be an accomplice to the husband.
In my opinion, Terzi's husband is innocent,
and we have to release him.
I am responsible for this case,
and the husband stays in custody.
Very well, we keep him in custody.
You don't understand,
the husband is innocent.
It is necessary to hold the husband here
to calm the public opinion.
You're a bureaucrat, public opinion frightens you.
Stay calm, don't worry.
He believes we're living in the kingdom
of Sicily at the time of Borboni!
He thinks only of the public opinion.
He is old and destined in disappear, don't worry.
What do you want?
Look here! What am I going to say
to him this time?
- To whom?
- Mangani.
In connection with the case?
He wants know if I know the
person who phoned me.
He asked about the package.
- Why are you asking me about it?
- You have phoned me.
Be rational. I couldn't have called you if
the package was not yet in headquarters.
You have phoned me!
You don't have to repeat that I phoned you.
I did not phone you!
I'm favoring you, and therefore
you should be careful.
This machine makes good coffee.
Unfortunately I'm unable to drink coffee.
Take a cappuccino.
- Take this machine away!
Nisticò, get to work!
Hello.
Doctor, I need your advice.
What is happening to you?
Come with me.
- We have to help eachother.
- Doctor, a phonogram.
What's this? In this city not only
whores are killed...
...but also the order and the social equilibrium.
In 24 hours three house occupations,
students and teachers.
In six months italians have striked
81 million hours.
- Do you have a painkiller?
- No.
- You agree that Terzi's husband is innocent?
- Certainly.
To demonstrate his innocence I have to find...
...who has the blue tie.
- Yes, it will be necessary find him.
The evening of the crime you wore a blue tie.
- Where did you buy it?
- From "Cenci " by the Pantheon.
Cenci remembers having sold a
tie equal to yours...
...to a lady.
- Augusta Terzi.
Then the victim has given the tie to her murderer.
The victim has given the tie to her murderer.
I would exclude that she has
given it to the husband.
It seems logical to me, exclude it.
I...
What can I do?
What can I do to help you?
Do you want my blue tie?
Just go to my house.
Ask the service woman, she will give it to you.
You will find her in the mornings.
- Do you have a painkiller?
- Can I go to your house?
Yes.
Do you understand?
Three occupations in 24 hours.
Students, barricades and teachers.
Teachers!
- Can I leave?
- When this stuff arrives...
...I prefer homicide.
- Of course.
Thank you, doctor.
Then I can indeed go to
your home for the tie?
How disgusting!
Take off that undershirt, your mother
will never know about it.
And those short black socks you
are wearing, like a priest.
In the Sacristy.
Do you have a more cheerful suit?
- No.
- People avoid those who dress like you.
It is clear that you are a police officer,
stinking of barracks and files.
Of security chambers.
At least a priest smells of incense.
They have a free deodorant.
I would kill you with my hands.
What courage!
You conduct the investigations.
- Could I ask you for a favor?
- You are welcome.
Go in there and buy all the blue ties on display.
- Why don't you go yourself?
- They would believe I was a competitor...
...and would take advantage of it.
- They will cost 50.000 liras!
Yes, that's ok.
Why do you want all the blue ties?
I am the producer of a theatrical show.
The title of the show is "50 blue ties
for 50 big babies".
- Well done!.
- I'll wait down there.
- Where?
- Under the colonnade.
But...
- Bring them to me.
- Yes.
There are 4.000 liras left.
Do you know what happened?
They believed I worked in police
headquarters and gave me a discount.
They even called me "marshal"!
Here are the ties.
I counted them, there are 25.
- What is your work?
- Why is that?
- What is your work?
- I?
- I am a plumber.
- A plumber!
- I work when I want!
- Who do you vote for?
Why? Why is that of interest to you?
- I'm asking who you vote for!
- That is none of your business!
I take only one tie, the others you keep.
Why? You have to give me an
explanation, mister!
I'll explain it now. You have to take
these 24 ties to police headquarters.
Go to the homicide department.
I am not a theatrical producer.
I am a murderer.
- What?
- A murderer.
A murderer. You read the newspapers.
Remember the murdered lady in
Via del Tempio? I killed her.
What are you saying?
You are a decent person.
- You are playing around with me.
- No, I'm not playing around.
You are in trouble.
Why? I haven't done anything.
Be quiet! I will explain it all.
Anyone who comes into contact with
a murderer is in trouble.
Go to headquarters, Homicide Department
and describe me well.
Describes details like time, place
and conditions of our meeting.
Please, look closely at me.
Describe me in detail.
It is rare to be this close to
the face of a murderer.
Look me over, try to remember how my hair is combed.
See if I have whiskers, how I am dressed...
Please give me time to go
home and say hello to my wife and child.
- Go to the headquarters!
- I'm staying here!
Don't be a clown, it is your
plight as a good citizen!
- Listen.
- Go!
- Go to headquarters!
- Listen to me.
Mister!
- Go to headquarters!
- Come back here.
Cross on red, ignore the law.
No!
Do it, cross on red!
Do you want to cross on red?
Yes, you are capable of anything.
Let's go!
I go!
I go!
Did you see that?
Show your ID card to the officer.
Tell him you are an important man, frighten him.
- Treat him badly.
- Licence and registration.
- To am on duty. Please!
- Excuse me, doctor.
You can commit any crime, believe me.
No!
Good! You resemble the beheaded one
at Castel Gandolfo.
Aquatic rape.
Would you be capable of killing me on the
beach without being discovered?
Can a police officer kill someone on the
beach without being discovered?
I was seen by the car park
attendant, the ticket salesman.
The beach-attendants.
Those near of the beach hut have seen me.
The car park attendant seems
the more dangerous.
A car park attendant would never
accuse an important person like you.
To be caught you would have to sign a
crime with your name.
You haven't convinced me as to the
illegality, it's too easy in my position.
Courage, let's plan a beautiful crime.
I would cut your throat and hide you.
I would throw you into the sea with the fish.
At sunset a bathing attendant
would find your body in a hut.
The magistrate of Latin would see you the next day...
...in state of advanced decomposition.
What are you doing?
Bitch!
"The poisoning of water and air continues."
"The sea is a dustbin."
"The 300 communes on the coast..."
Augusta!
"There are no purification plans."
Augusta, quit the joke. Get out.
"The coastal waters are polluted..."
"...by hydrocarbons from oil."
Augusta, let's go.
I'll give an order of demolition for these houses!
Augusta!
Doctor, put on protecion.
This morning the young Napolitan
who works with you came around.
- Who? Biglia?
- Yes.
- What did he want?
- He was looking for a tie.
- I did not give it to him.
- Of course, I have it on me!
Then you have two. Yesterday I saw
the other in a rubber shoe.
He even wanted to see your shoes.
I understood at once he was a snoop,
he asked a lot of questions.
- What did he want to know?
- He asked if you meet women here.
- Then?
- If you are engaged.
- And then what?
- What you were doing on Sunday.
- Get out of here, I have to work.
- I have not finished.
Finish later.
Good morning!
- How are you doing, homicide workers?
Life is good at the Security Department!
Good morning.
I have brought my tie, to not waste your time.
What is it?
What have you done?
- Homicide.
- I would do it again!
He has killed his employer.
Are you be able to come? There is a man...
What's been happening this morning?
Nothing, he is probably a mythomaniac.
This gentleman wants to ask you some questions.
Who is he?
- Well?
- Excuse me, doctor.
Perhaps...
No, I have certainly made a mistake.
On what matter?
- I have confused you with another.
- With who?
He first believed to have
recognized you.
He says that this morning a strange
man gave him  money...
...to buy all those ties.
Then he told him he was the
murderer of Augusta Terzi.
- Let him speak!
- Thank you.
It passed like this.
I met an individual.
He told me to go to police headquarters.
- Who was he?
- I don't know, perhaps he was crazy.
Perhaps he was manager of
a theatre or a cinema.
I believed him.
He warned me that I would end up in trouble.
- What kind of work do you do?
- I...
- I am a plumber.
- He's a "stagnaro".
- A plumber.
- A plumber, a stagnaro.
- You said "stagnaro" once.
- A stagnaro!
- Yes, it is true.
- What did you say?
- You are right.
- Don't worry about it.
- Are you sure? Thank you.
- Be calm.
You are a citizen.
We have to respect a citizen.
Thank you, doctor.
Mangani. Come with me, please.
Yes.
Afterwards, let's do the accounts.
This should have been done as confrontation,
but no procedural rules were respected.
- Get back inside.
- Mangani, I dismiss you!
- Be careful!
- No! return to your offices!
Doctor, it is my fault.
I was confused, I did not look closely.
- Take him away away.
- That man had a different suit.
- Listen.
- Dont touch me!
I will ask to hold back Terzi's
husband and this idiot.
- Do you agree?
- Do as you want.
I will do what I have to do.
Dear stagnaro, you have to tell the truth!
You are involved in this and
I will find out how !
I didn't like the cappuccino.
It requires equal parts bitter
coffee and sweet milk.
Nisticò, I'm sending you to gather
information at Piazza Navona!
Get rid of this machine! Don't let anyone in.
- Commander, are you alone?
- Yes.
Have you authorized checks on me
in connection with the Terzi case?
I will ask for a detailed report from
the employee in charge.
We will talk tonight over dinner.
This is not good enough!
The whole Homicide Department must
be subjected to investigation!
In my office we are ready to
investigate their systems...
...their public and private lives!
- Very well, but now you are threatening me.
- Sure I am!
I need to collect three recordings
for the Security Department.
I'm not allowed to give out anything,
by orders of the director.
- When did you receive the order?
- I cannot say.
Was it a written order or by telephone?
Doctor, don't insist.
Would you be able give me the
three tapes for two hours?
Doctor, I would lose my job.
- The career matters to all of us.
- Even to me. Try to understand.
Want to favor my career?
Then help me.
- To the ventilator!
- Stop, return to your places!
- Where did it happen?
- By the ventilator!
Please, only security agents.
Even you, stay away.
- Doctor, it is is here. Come.
- Stay calm.
- Stay calm!
- It's in this part.
It's a bad situation.
Let me pass.
- Don't touch anything.
- Don't touch.
This time they have gone too far.
Attention!
They're coming.
Now it is enough, it is unbelievable.
at 18:30 there were two other explosions...
...to the American Express and
the Palazzo di Giustizia.
Please, let us through.
The explosion happened here.
We need to act decisively, we know them all.
We must show our determination!
Enough with the tolerance! Understood?
Yes.
- Well.
Please, let us through.
# Noi vogliam per esso
siano infrante...
#... le catene alla libertà!
# Giustizia sempre noi chiediamo!
# Non più servi, non più signori! #
Unseat the leadership! Mao! Ho Chi Minh!
- Police officers, you are our brothers.
Mao! Ho Chi Minh!
Mao! Ho Chi Minh!
- Power to the working class!
Mao! Ho Chi Minh!
Death to the leadership!
Anarchy! anarchy!
- Doctor.
- What do you want? Go away!
War no! Guerilla yes!
War no! Guerilla yes!
- Commissary!
- Go! Get inside!
Check all the identification cards.
For now, don't talk to the press.
- Do we have informants among them?
- Yes, five.
What do you want?
What do you want? You looked at me.
I?
I am nearly blind.
Mind your own business!
Hello? Yes, I am alone.
I'm cold, speak.
I am alone.
Alone!
You want to create a jealousy scene on the phone?
Then put a bug on my telephone
and start following me.
Put a television camera underneath my sheets.
You have 500 men at your command,
one of them can surely follow me.
That way you will always know who
I'm with and what I'm doing.
"The time has come to end our relationship."
Augusta, this dismissal letter would
fit well in a serial novel.
I'm leaving it here between your legs!
Are you leaving?
Augusta, I am not jealous.
You can do whatever you want.
Sleep with whoever you want.
But tell me first, I have to know.
Augusta, do not put me in this condition.
I am a respectable person!
Augusta, I represent the power!
You should be kissing the earth
where I walk, you bitch!
Who is Pace? That shit!
He is my friend and lives up here.
He is young, beautiful and even revolutionary.
- Revolutionary! I'll beat you!
- Don't touch me, moron.
You are not in headquarters now,
you're in my home. Go away!
I am not one of those wrecks you arrest.
You make love like a child because you are a child!
- Stop shouting.
- Perhaps you still pee in bed.
You are nobody!
You are sexually incompetent.
- Do you understand?
- Don't beat me!
- You're incompetent!
- Don't touch me.
- You're a child!
- Don't touch me.
Stand relaxed, sit down.
- Beautiful sunset!
- We've been on our feet for 16 hours.
You may return to your barracks soon.
- Doctor, we are tired.
- Hold this.
# Bandiera rossa la trionferà!
Bandiera rossa la trionferà! #
Doctor, they have the same names
as thirty years ago.
They have the revolution in their blood.
- Good evening, doctor.
- Good evening.
Doctor, do not tolerate them anymore.
Assassins, fascists!
Inform yourselves!
Inform yourselves!
The cell doesn't unite them either.
In two hours, four groups have formed.
Fortunately, they are divided, otherwise
 it would be difficult for us.
I want to question Antonio Pace.
But first, the boy near him with the whiskers.
Servants of the leadership!
Up! don't lean on your hands.
The weigh of the body has to be on the knees.
You're not a horse, walking on four legs!
You're a democratic citizen, not a horse.
Would you rather drink another
litre of saltwater...
...or stay on your knees?
You decide.
If you want to stand up, you must
drink all the water.
You have to drink it all.
All.
Nothing. Then kneel again.
It is not necessary for you to drink.
In ten minutes you could be
drinking fresh and pure water.
" clear, sweet and fresh water!"
Student, I don't want to imprison you.
We are not the Gestapo or the SS.
We are the police of a democratic country.
We are pleased when we avoid
sentencing a citizen.
You are young, I don't want ruin you.
Stay upright! You can be Marxist, anarchic...
...situationist and Maoist.
You can read the red book, you
can behave how you like.
You are not a horse, you're a democratic citizen.
I have to respect you.
However the terrorist explosions.
The intimidations and the bombs.
What has that got to do with democracy?
If you tell me who put the bomb in
headquarters and in American Express...
...you act as a democratic
and coherent citizen.
I know you did not do it.
However you certainly know the name of the
person who has committed the crime.
Give me some water.
We do not ask you to rat on your friends.
We want you to act as a democratic citizen.
We speak to modern men.
What is democracy?
Admit it.
You are the opposite of socialists.
I, for example, vote socialist.
Don't be afraid.
I am your confessor, they all have spoken to me.
Nothing will happen to you, I am a "vault".
This whole building is a great vault.
Tell the truth.
Tell the truth.
Say his name!
Pace put the bomb there
when you were visiting headquarters!
- Yes.
- He has prepared the bombs?
Yes.
Mattone, bring in Antonio Paace.
He is finished.
Up.
You are free.
If you need something, phone me.
I don't want to!
Canes, Mattone, leave us alone.
Go drink some coffee.
Leave me alone with the companion.
A companion of yours has accused you.
In prison not there are doctors,
but bank robbers.
Antonio Pace, born in Ravenna 1946.
Ex chemistry student.
Anarchic individualist.
Convicted to three months of prison in 1968...
...for resisting the police.
Why are you howling?
Do you know who I am?
You're the lover of the lady who
was killed on the floor below.
- By who and when?
- In my opinion you killed her...
...Sunday the 24th of August.
- At what time?
I my opinion you killed her between 17 and 19.
At that time I saw you at the gate.
- If you are so sure, accuse me.
- I would love to.
- Accuse me!
- Here you are and here you stay!
- A murdering criminal directing the repression.
- Accuse me!
- It is perfect.
- You have to accuse me!
- I have made a mistake, but I want to pay.
- It is perfect!
- Don't shout!
- Do your job.
You have to accuse me because I am a person...
Open!
For the next action I'll phone you.
You're in my powers!
What are you doing? Come here, don't
behave like a child. Be reasonable.
I want out, let me go.
He has not done nothing, release him.
The student! Understand?
"You are in my powers." Understand?
How are you?
Silence.
Even you have come for the Botta crime?
- No, I am here for the Terzi crime.
- The woman killed with a blade.
I have yold you to be silent.
- Good morning, doctor.
- How are you?
I am fine.
Pallottella.
- I am here.
- It is your turn.
- No.
I'll go.
Pallottella, come!
Close the door.
Come forward, Pallottella.
Ruffiano, come forward.
Enter, son of a bitch.
You small clerk, " policeman ".
You never understood the meaning
of my gestures and of my sacrifice.
I want to affirm the concept of
authority in its purest form.
- You incapable!
- What have I done?
I deliver you the murderer of Augusta Terzi.
Thank you.
From this moment I am at the disposition of justice.
If you want to question me, I will be at home.
My god!
- These things happen.
- I have made a mistake.
- This morning you will go home.
- Sure.
- My god!
- Please, this way.
Where?
Now you may recognize me.
No, I don't know you.
I don't know anyone!
Help! I don't know anyone!
What have you done?
You have not thought about us?
We are your colleagues.
Do what you have to.
Article 247.
"Cases where house custody may be used."
" When the circumstances..."
"...and the moral state of the arrested allows it..."
"...the attorney of the republic..."
"...and the magistrate may declare..."
"...that instead of jailtime..."
"...the arrested shall stay
temporarily in state of arrest..."
"...in his residence."
Doctor, they are all here.
Come.
Doctors, excellencies.
Excellence.
I am sorry to have disturbed so many important persons.
Eat.
Dear colleague, where were you from 15 to 19...
...on the day of the murder of Augusta Terzi?
Excellence, doctors.
I was there. I killed her.
- Can you prove you were in her house?
- I have to give you bad news.
There was a witness to my presence.
The subversive student Pace...
...saw me enter the building.
Not true, the student Antonio Pace
has an alibi of iron.
He was out of Rome that afternoon.
I have questioned him for hours my own way.
Excellence, the bloody tracks...
...found in the home of Augusta Terzi...
...they belong to my left shoe.
My friend, there exists a lot of shoes of the same size...
...and of the same type.
I have an identical pair.
Me too.
In the apartment I have left
my fingerprints everywhere.
Even on the faucets of the shower.
Doctors, excellencies.
After the murder I washed myself.
It is strange. On faucets, glasses and
handles there were none of your imprints.
However, the blue fibre under her
fingernail belongs to a tie of mine.
- Then give us that tie.
- I have destroyed it.
- Why?
- In that moment I didn't know...
...if I should confess the crime...
...or use my small powers to cover up the traces.
You have had a a dissociation, a neurosis.
However it is a contracted illness
due to the prolonged use of power.
It is an illness common to a lot of powerful persons...
...in our little society.
- I'm doing well.
- Enough with the psychology!
We'll do tests to show his guilt.
Not words, but facts!
I have bought the 25 blue ties
to that poor deficient man.
- No, he did not recognize you.
- He denied it because he was afraid.
When he understood I was a police officer...
Do not give offensive judgments against them...
...the core and the institutions.
- Speak of the facts.
- What's your motive?
- You are playing games with me!
You are playing games with me and institutions!
- Even with you, gentlemen!
- That is not a demonstrable motive.
Excuse me, excellence.
Gentlemen, excuse me.
It is a private matter.
Come. Excellence, a little discretion.
Each day in her company revealed
my incompetence as a human being.
It is absurd, unlikely, science fiction!
- Then I have killed her because of jealousy!
- You did not know her.
Prove it. She was not your lover, nobody
has seen you two together.
You are right, gentlemen. One moment.
I'll go to take the test of my guilt.
I'll  return quickly.
You have killed a useless person.
Someone else would have killed me,
I was destined to die like that.
Do what they say.
Think of your colleagues.
Think of your career.
This photo shows the victim has
been photographed here.
Check the furnishings and the floor!
The victim expresses erotic situations...
...in D'Annunzio type settings.
What a disgrace!
I confirm my version of the facts!
He is an immature person.
He lacks corporal spirit,
because of this he ends like that.
- I will write a memorial!
- Cincin! to the health.
- I will do what you want.
Well!
Bravo, son.
Do you want say something?
- I confess my innocence.
- Well done!.
Sign here.
Good, be calm.
Doctors, colleagues.
There is an enemy in the free who
knows the facts.
He won't use use them only against me,
but against all of us.
Against the powers and against God!
That is an open case.
You are welcome. Have a seat, gentlemen.
