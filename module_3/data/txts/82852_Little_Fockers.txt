Reply you.

-- You do not like?
Hey, what about Grandpa Jack?
Greg, are Jack Byrnes.
Yes, I know, I've been recognized by
Caller ID.
<i> What are you </ i>
Greg, sorry that you leave the table
saying exactly these words:
"I do not know if I have it,
but let me check my records. "
What?
Pam asks if I want,
tell him ...
I asked to look
your birth certificate
My genealogical research.
Say it.
I do not know if I have it, Jack,
but let me check my records.
Folders? Did you this?
Yes. Yes, I have. I have some folders.
You are interested in my birth certificate
R
tree, so ...
Jack, something happened?
It's all right, Greg.
I suffered a minor heart attack,
but I managed to get defibrillator
before they go into cardiac arrest.
Jesus, you alone defibrillator?
My doctor said I was lucky,
but must take care to diet
and reduce stress.
Okay ...
So that means I will not
children arrive at the party?
<i>, Dina and I'll be there
as promised, Greg. </ i>
I managed to say this
only those who had to know ...
and now,
you're the only one who should know.
Come on Jack, I think, Dina
need to know.
-- Greg, shut up and listen to me.
-- Okay.
Genealogical research has allowed me
Byrnes to track all family members
until 1643.
So in 1643?
I could do the same thing
and your family.
But there are too many punks and peasants
meaningless ...
As long as the family <i> Byrnes
There was always a leader </ i>
<i> family who guided both times
in the good and less good ...</ i>
I concluded that the next
heir to the throne, Greg ...
you.
Me?
Yes, you, Greg.
<i> So my question is ...</ i>
If I die,
are you ready to lead this family?
You know, Jack, we have dinner now.
Can we talk about it when you come out?
If I die, Greg, you need to know
that someone will assume responsibility
Byrnes for the entire clan.
So the question is Greg
Ready to become ...
"The Godfather" Focker?
"The Godfather" Focker?
"The Godfather" Focker.
It is a question implied
strong, Jack.
When you say "The Godfather" Focker, I mean ...
I think I know what you mean, but I ...
What does that mean exactly?
It is a behavior, Greg
means trust.
The way you behave.
With this show
world that you are the leader.
Yes, I understand.
You can not get that without some
basic rules.
A safe home for your family,
an excellent education for
your kids ...
Well.
And last but not least,
to have your finances in order, Greg.
That's all?
-- Laugh?
-- Yes, it was a joke ... No.
Shaving is not a problem, Greg.
Well, that does not laugh, okay?
You say you what you need to become
"The Godfather" Focker?
-- Greg?
-- Yes.
Jack, I have what I need ...
to become the "Godfather" Focker.
I feel like I
escaped a heavy burden.
Of course, now became
your burden.
I love it. I like the weight.
I want it.
Well. Only you know it.
<i> Only me. Between us. </ I>
-- See you in two weeks.
-- Okay. Goodbye.
-- Hey, have you found?
-- How to find?
Birth certificate?
Yes. It was among my files.
You know, I thought it would be good to visit
Human Early school yet.
Awesome. I'll make some calls
to arrange a visit.
-- Okay.
-- Okay.
Samantha ...
Henry gonna eat lasagna?
No thanks.
You know, your mother worked hard to you
cook that lasagna.
Not because they taste funny.
He said he is sick, so ...
We are okay.
Henry, is your father
and that require you to eat lasagna.
Well.
Well.
-- Hello?
-- Hello?
Greg, are Jack Byrnes.
<i> Jack Byrnes, Greg Focker is. </ i>
I know Greg, I'm calling you.
Dina and I'll get
in about 18 seconds.
<i> Eighteen seconds, I understand. </ i>
No, this is yours!
Welcome, in--laws ...
God, Gregory.
Dina, Dina, Dina!
-- Glad to see you so much.
-- The wonderful Dina.
You're cute, Gregory.
-- Hi Jack!
-- Greg.
-- It's all right, Greg?
-- Everything is great.
Well.
Unfortunately, home renovations ...

Well, stuff happens.
Yes, but I do not have happened.
Great job Sam
the lessons of Taekwondo.
-- Now is ... yellow belt, huh?
-- Yes.
-- I love that belt.
-- Yes ...
Bravo!
It is deadly, a real Ninja!
Henry to drink your milk
huh?
If you want to reach height
your sister.
Jack ...
I tell myself, for it is hard to believe
the difference is only 3 minutes between them.
Henry, do what my grandfather says.
I'm serious.
Bravo.
Okay, who wants turkey?
-- I!
-- I!
Yes?
Honey, did not have to cook a
whole turkey for us!
Why not?
-- Greg actually cooked it.
-- Greg ...
Well, I remembered that last year
Thanksgiving
Jack said he likes fried turkey
very much and I do not understand
why people do it
only once a year.
-- You have an excellent memory, Greg.
-- Plus ...
Does not contain fat.
It's healthy, you do not harm the heart.
How sweet ...
-- Grandpa Jack, can I ask you something?
-- Sure you can.
Why are you afraid of lizards?
Henry, very good question.
I'll tell you why.
When I was assigned to the company Maicon
Delta during the Vietnam War
a small lizard has crept into the ear
My one night and he made eggs there.
He had to endure the most terrible
intervention
Our unit made by Dr.
out to me
lizard eggs in your ear
before they hatch in the brain.
-- Jack
-- Cool!
Yes. Thanks for shared
this with us, Dad.
All right, look around the world
Dinosaur coming!
Watch this.
It is a work of art.
Thank you very much.
-- Looks great, Greg.
-- Thanks, Jack.
And to cut it ...
I thought to use the wonderful knife
Irish hunting
family crest bearing Byrnes
that Jack has brought him to us
generously ...
the homeland of his ancestors.
Look, kids.
See this logo? It was used
Our ancestors,
many years ago,
in ancient times
when they were fighting for their families.
-- Dad, can I ask you something?
-- Absolutely!
He loves history, is passionate.
A girl can poop through the vagina?
It can not.
You're too young to family history.
Yes and deviates a bit from the subject.
-- Jack, please.
-- Greg ...
You're the one who cut the turkey now.
Thanks, I am honored.
Okay, to cut the roasted beast!
Let's see, I think I'll start
with the right side.
So Greg you like your new job?
Well, to tell you, Dina ...
are a lot of responsibility on my shoulders ...
but I love this job.
I mean that I have the opportunity to
manage an entire department.
Somehow e. ..
Shit!
-- Jack
-- Greg!
-- You ruined!
-- Hold!
Answer the phone!
Hello?
Hello, Kevin!
It's Kevin, folks!
What?
Are you in Chicago?
Hi! Hi everyone!
-- Hello.
-- Kevin!
I'm Good to see you.
-- Here 's our logoditul!
-- What are you doing, man?
What happened to your finger?
We had a small incident
While turkey cut it.
-- Where's Svetlana?
-- Yes!
Or rather,
Future Mrs. Kevin Rawley?
-- I left.
-- No.
Are you kidding?
-- I'm sorry.
-- Thanks, Pam.
You always know what to say.
As I am truly sorry?
You are my salvation.
-- What happened?
-- What?
What happened?
I do not know yet
I try to understand.
We eat something outside, next to the building
Government in Bulgaria ...
and I asked her
"You want to get married?
I took a piece of string
and I tied her finger.
But she threw it away
saying "no"
or 'niet', that is Russian.
He went with the first plane.
"Goodbye Kevin."
But your proposal has
bit of the essence.
Why did not you trying to put
more passion?
That taught me Greg.
What ... Kevin, no, no ...
what you mean ... I do not ...
-- Dad, I can not sleep.
-- Diapers ...
Jack, use diapers.
No longer wears diapers.
What is it, buddy?
I think all the blood sooner.
Really? Well. You want to read a story?
-- Uncle Kevin!
-- Hey! What's up, tiger?
Well.
-- Have trouble sleeping?
-- Yes.
Ready.
Jesus, Henry!
He fell asleep.
Sleeping.
I made a point property.
It is a massage technique
that relaxes the body,
by reducing blood flow sluggish
spinal column.
Yes, look at him.
You wake up refreshed.
I learned many healing techniques
east while I was gone.
Listen, I just came to say hello.
I will leave now.
-- Okay.
-- Okay.
Kev, you need a place to stay?
No, do not need. Nowhere to sit, huh?
-- We are so very many here.
-- It's nothing.
I volunteered at an orphanage
I'll probably stay there for a while.
In the morning I will help in the kitchen.
You're so generous, Kevin ...
Yes, it's funny, I give them food,
feed my soul and those homeless.
It's good for everybody.
Perfect.
All the time we need help,
if you want to come tomorrow.
Greg and I actually go to visit
Human Early school tomorrow
but maybe after ...
Really? Human Early School?
-- Yes.
-- My Investors deal with their substance.
In fact, I am Prudence Director
a good friend and a former girlfriend.
I'll put a good word for you.
It would be great, huh?
Absolutely.
I know myself, is a former girlfriend.
It's weird.
Nonsense, there are good relationships with
all my former girlfriends.
-- Thanks.
-- For less.
Well, as you think.
After that visit, Greg
hope you show us your new home.
Kevin, after you finish feeding
beggars, and you would not want to live there.
Okay, I'll come.
You know, Jack is a problem with contractors
so it might be
to postpone a few days.
-- No, let's do it tomorrow.
-- No, I think ...
-- See you there tomorrow, Kevin.
-- Okay.
-- Okay.
-- It will help you get over it.
You can call me for anything.
Well. Thanks J.B.
Yeah, or me.
You can call any
of us.
Yes, we are with you.
Thanks.
Watch with ...
I feel terrible.
-- Yes, of temperature.
-- Yes, we probably got flu
that they had children
last week.
-- Today was supposed to go to school?
-- Yes, I know.
Honey, what do I do?
-- I'll go, yes?
-- Really?
One could ask your mother a
to take children to school.
-- What about Dad?
-- I got it, okay?
I appreciate that you included
school tour and me, Greg.
Jack, you're a trusted advisor.
And help us at home with a good education
and ourselves
financial situation in order.
-- Right.
-- All children, huh?
-- Exactly.
-- The next generation.
Glad to hear you say that.
It makes me feel like I did
a wise choice to you.
Of course, the children change
everything in a marriage
and that was the problem
Debbie and Bob's case.
Have not found time for each other
with the coming of L.G in their lives.
So Bob was looking for pleasure
physics outside marriage.
-- Dr. Bob.
-- Dr. Bob.
I very much disappointed.
Let me tell you something, I want to give him
motherfuckin lesson reminder.
I know the new address.
Maybe I'll sneak in one night
and I put a small explosive device
oven,
seem to have been a gas leak.
Yes. Yes.
Or maybe find a way to limit law
to teach him a lesson.
You know?
-- And just a pay him.
-- Just kidding, Greg.
-- But it would be fun.
-- Yes, it would be great.
Hope you and Pam still
find time for each other.
Yes, yes. Are you kidding?
Yes, we are going great.
-- We are going great.
-- Okay.
I mean, you know, it is not easy
but we make time.
I feel physically attracted
My daughter, Greg?
For Pam? Are you kidding? Yes, Jack.
Jack was never a question of that.
Even after her body has endured
twins torment?
Yes, even after that.
Everything is fine.
Everything is fine under the hood.
That is disgusting.
Welcome, parents.
I am Prudence Simons
Director of Human Early school.
And here at "E.H.S." we know ...
We know that there
Early Human just two students.
So, why their education
should be identical?
-- Am I right?
-- It does make sense.
This is not about those graduates 99.8%
going to the best secondary schools.
-- Impressive.
-- Yes.
-- This guy has used often "Bowflex".
-- What?
It is overwhelmingly
Early students of Human
who become civic leaders,
or directors
of the top 500 firms.
No. What is important to us
is that everyone will get to be themselves.
Please welcoming
Human Early school acrobats!
They are very good.
-- I like what I see in this place.
-- Yes.
And I'm sure is not cheap.
You think you're doing?
Yes. Yes, it's done.
You know how y. ..
If not addressed now,
one to solve.
Until I fix, you pay.
Do you have money or not, Greg?
New friends, good day!
-- Hello.
-- Hello.
-- I am Prudence.
-- Greg. What are you doing?
-- Jack?
-- I am Jack Burns.
Jack, Greg, tell me what path you chose?
I mean, as a living will?
Okay.
Well, I'm a nurse.
-- Yes.
-- Is modest.
The fact is the manager
Department of Surgery
Hospital's Memorial in Chicago
and I are retired florist.
How random!
Medical assistant and the florist. Awesome!
May I ask how long
you know?
-- For about eight years?
-- Yes.
-- Eight years.
-- Really?
Yes ...
-- Eight years great.
-- Eight years great.
Yes ...
-- I had a difficult beginning, but ...
-- There were such moments.
Yes. Then we understood.
You seem a lovely couple.
-- No! No! We are not gay.
-- Yes, we are not.
He is my son.
No, no, no ...
However, if needed, we can be flexible.
Okay ...
Interesting joke!
I appreciate your sense of humor
in a moment of misunderstanding.
So ... Thank you, Greg.
-- Jack, I hope I did not hurt.
-- No, no, no.
Are you sure?
One I'm not gay,
but if I,
I would definitely be proud to have him
as a life partner on Gay Focker.
That is his real name.
Gaylord was my name
I was young,
So, yes ...
I conclude the discussion here.
Jack was a pleasure.
Gay.
-- Greg.
-- Great. Change the name of that label.
You can call me Greg. Greg's good.
What would have to remain honest?
A traditional American home, right?
Yes. Yes. It has a good structure and ...
You know ...
Hello! Here you are!
-- Kevin, the nice car!
-- Yes ...
Gustavo, my assistant got me one.
It is for test drive
Organic is apparently
that the 2003 Prius.
-- Greg ...
-- Yes, it's good.
Looks awesome!
A traditional American house.
-- Has a solid structure.
-- Yes!
You have a good eye, Kevin.
-- That is good.
-- Randy!
Randy, what is this?
Gregory Focker!
Glad to see you!
What's up man?
Randy, what is this?
Over two days we have here a party.
-- Freshen up my memory, Gregory.
-- Are you kidding?
Randy anniversary
birthday of the twins!
-- Remember?
-- Certainly, certainly.
The problem we face,
I had to pull it
Rotten iron 30 feet away.
So you have some additional costs
and an obvious delay.
Randy yard that will be ready, or not?
Jack, I'll deal with that problem, right?
Mr. Byrnes wanted to suggest
advantage as you can without
from
a gentle soul and confident
which is obviously an amateur
when it comes to building.
-- No, Kevin!
-- Thanks.
It is not true.
-- It's true, Greg, you steal.
-- Do not ...
Workers are in the coffee break
in the last eight minutes.
Old Man there
can not work,
and excavator driver
solve sudoku.
-- Okay.
-- Gregory, who is this joker ...
What they doubt my honor?
Nobody put your
honor questioned, Randy.
-- I work for 34 years in this job.
-- Thirty--four years?
Must pump, and I cover to download
court to recover it.
I have news for you.
You can do this
all you want, but it is in vain ...
-- Jack? Jack?
-- And you know it!
-- I steal!
-- Hey! Hey!
-- The Japanese have surrendered!
-- Ready!
The Japanese have surrendered!
-- What are you talking about?
-- World War II.
Tell you what, Gregory.
I have a house in town.
What would you do spend there?
Greenery. It'll be perfect.
No. No, Kevin.
I promised the children
that we will spend in the yard.
So, guess what?
We will party in the courtyard.
Okay?
When the driver returns from a lunch break,
and that one was out to a level.
Wait a minute.
You mean you can not move the thing?
This is union work, Dad.
Hell, move him myself.
You know what, Jack?
A I do, right?
-- You directs me in the street.
-- Okay.
I got it.
Ready!
Come on, it's free.
-- Come to you, Jack!
-- You're doing great. You're doing great.
Look, I'm not union, Randy, but
give back the dump!
Come on! Back! Back!
You're doing great.
You're doing great. Stop!
Press brake! Stop!
Stop it!
-- Ready!
-- It's good.
-- Pull the handbrake.
-- He did.
Jack!
God! Jack!
-- Jack
-- Jack, I'm right here.
Jack, you out! Jack!
Come here!
Jack?
I'll be alright, Jack!
Jack, come!
Hang on, Jack.
I found him!
I've found.
I'm Kevin.
I'm right here.
-- Thanks, Kevin.
-- Do not talk, keep your energy.
Slowly.
Greg's here. It's good.
Yes, I see.
Hi, Jack.

I look at these bills Randy's

we really could use the money.
Do me a favor, do not tell

My Father, why?
I pressed
in order to have financial situation.
Whatever ...

As a former nurse.
Not leaving anything out.
I know I do this for us

sell drugs for erectile
in a hotel, I was scared.
-- Honey, you do not have to worry about.
-- Okay. Well.
-- I love you.
-- And me, baby. Goodbye.
<i> Goodbye. </ i>
Why not talk to your father?
Because she said you're crazy.
He said I'm crazy?
-- You should discuss this with him.
-- Yes ...
But Mommy and Daddy
everything is wrong with them?
The argument sometimes.
Yes? And what is the argument?
Mom was mad at dad
she goes to a hotel with Andy.
With Andy?
Who is Andy?
I can not say that
I'm not allowed to spy.
But what I tell you?
It is better to spy,
as long as the suspect
that something is wrong.
So who is Andy?
Andy's dad gives erections.
It gives you?
Andy's dad gives erections.
-- Hi guys. How are you?

Yes! Daddy!
Hey ...
You, Sam?

I do not want!
You just did.
-- Hey, Greg?
-- Yes.
You know, I'm not sure that using jokes
and his attention distragandu
is the best way
does your daughter to communicate with you.
No, no, no.
There are jokes and distractions.
If somehow matter ...
Matter, thank you.
See you later, okay?
Gotta go to dinner

Jack! Jack? You?
-- Greg.
-- What are you doing here?
Buy milk for the morning.
-- Looking for a store?
-- Yes.
It's one right across from my house.
Really? I did not know that.
-- You left on Lincoln's right there.
-- Thanks, Greg.
-- See you later.
-- Okay.
Excuse me.
Hi!
-- Greg.
-- Hey, man.
Follow me?
You follow? No, why do you watch?
No, just looking for milk.
Okay, but remember that I told you
it is a shop in the neighborhood?
That's right, but Dinah
likes organic stuff
and I heard that a store
natural products in the center.
Amazingly, all the way to go
just for a glass of milk.
You know, you should come down here.
It's a great store with natural products
station two blocks away.
Goodnight, Jack.
And you, Greg.
Hi!
Hello, superstarule!
Is everything okay? You seem a little nervous.
No, I'm fine.
My in--laws are in town, so ...
Anyway, I read brochures
and I think I understand
good scientific evidence.
No, Greg.
Doctors do not care about it.
If you want to sell
a drug that Sustengo,
should personally approach.
Know any sexually frustrated old man
heart problems?
I did not hear it coming.
What took you so long?
I lost a bit.
-- Everyone asleep?
-- Yes.
We have at our house.
I'm so happy ...
you missed
Your wife.
-- What?
-- He was suspicious lately.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
We have only one hour!
I have no idea what you're talking.
Jack, come on, you must enter the role.
Roz Focker said that we must have
an affair with each other.
-- To play different roles.
-- Okay, I understand.
My head hurts a little, baby, tonight.
All day you had looked worried.
I promise you that the family
Focker'll be fine.
Come ... Before coming
my husband home.
Then we must hurry,
My girlfriend illegal.
Let me just want to brush my teeth.
Your father did not really put
the device to detect lies.
-- No, that was true.
-- It's incredible!
Jesus Christ and I thought for
My wife's father is evil.
-- Nice speech, asistentule.
-- Thanks.
Hey, I'm staring at you ...
"I'm watching you," he said so.
Yes. Thanks.
You were dead tonight.
Stories about your family were great.
Thanks.
Gotta go.
Wait a minute!
Pretend you're my fiance.
Hello, gorgeous.
Hello, Doctor Balard. Glad to see you.
Can I get two hundred something
drink, fast?
Only if you buy and
My fiance drink.
I did not know that you are engaged.
We can take a picture?
No need to do that.
-- Yes ...
-- No, there's no problem, you do.
You're a dear.
Let's see!
One, two, three, and!
The best photo.
You look great.
You have a problem with red eyes.
See ya, honey.
-- I can not believe I slept with him.
-- Yes, definitely.
Seriously, I did.
At a convention in
Mawaki last summer.
I drank some tequila
we've got to race with rum ...
-- It's a bad idea to mix drinks, right?
-- Yes.
-- Well ...
-- I get a Margarita on the rocks without salt?
You know ...
Go to the toilet.
You're the best!
-- Okay?
-- Okay.
Please give me a soda and
an ice Margarita without salt.
You went out, Focker?
Doctor Bob!
-- Hey, man!
-- What are you doing here?
I came to the Convention. You?
I was invited as
medical expert.
Are you registered nurse.
You know what, I have nothing to say.
Well. I understand, Greg.
I gave it in the bar.
Eventually I got stress
to be a member of that family.
What are you talking about?
You were his golden child.
Yes, I say whore's gold.
He wanted to me and Deb
get married in Oisture Bay, has been made.
Let your child baptized by him?
"You got it, Jack."
I make a speech about the
I am the successor to the throne ...
I found a name ..
Bob's nose.
Really? You said that?
He used the same method and you, right?
In some family that we all hamsters
Jack Byrnes on the wheel.
Circus of confidence, or how he says.
Circle of trust.
I did not know how deep they are buried
until I left.
Let me tell you something. And when
I left, are the happiest.
Yes, well, I think
I have everything under control.
Hi, Greg.
Hey. Hi, Jack.
Can you explain that?
What is that?
Yes. It Sustengo ...
You know ...
Pharmaceutical companies give me
always free samples.
That is,
or you need to use them
that you do not feel sexually attracted to Pam?
You know, Jack, so this is ridiculous.
Seriously.
I really do not want to discuss this with you.
This is ...
Good night, right? I go to bed.
I can not turn back, Focker.
Jack is everything okay down there?
All is well.
Well, it seems that you a. ..
I know very well, Greg ...
And I'm not concerned about that now.
What I want from you now
truth.
Jack, you took a pill of those?
I mind elsewhere.
Dina wanted to make love,
and the package clearly says is good
for heart patients.
Yes, but you need the recipe
After a thorough consultation.
How long have this "situation"?
Do not avoid the question.
Do not avoid it, but if you have that
more than four hours ...
blood vessels may burst
and have permanent consequences.
-- How long?
-- A little more than four hours.
-- How long?
-- In about five hours and a half.
Jack, you should go immediately to the Emergency Room
to make you an adrenaline injection,
counteract the effects of the drug.
You're not a nurse?
You have such drugs in the house?
Yes, I have a kit, but
I do not make your shot there, right?
Focker, under no circumstances go
to the emergency room with this thing.
So I got to sting.
Stab me now.
Stab me, shoot.
Do me now shot!
Relax, okay?
I'm going to take the syringe.
Okay, I need to ...
Do you pants down.
What drugs are evil
recommend your patients.
Jack, I said.
I took home some samples.
Okay?
Better read the instructions
before swallowing a pill.
Let's do it.
I'll do after the shot to number three.
Well ...
Well.
-- Relax.
-- Do you have cold hands.
Sorry. Well.
One ...
Two ...
-- Three!
-- Focker!
Shit!
What happened?
Everything's fine. Henry had a nightmare.
But now Greg reassures him.
But Jack, like you've heard
and you crying.
No, I've heard. It was just Henry.
-- I'm going to check if it feels good ...
-- No, go to bed.
Everything is under control.
You and Dad, you can be more silent
the future, please?
Look at your dog and the little ninja.
Okay?
-- Greg?
-- Yes.
What is?
It's okay.
You know, it's a bit shocked.
Greg, I took part in a program
CIA--funded secret in the 70s
the techniques involved and some
erasing the memory.
Give me a few minutes alone with him
to erase them from memory what he saw.
Do not let them remove my son's memory.
Greg watched as his father put him
a syringe in his grandfather's penis.
Already has some problems
of it might
to never come back no longer.
I got it, okay?
Okay?
Well.
Thanks.
What are you doing, buddy?
You know how sometimes you need
help ...
when you pee?
-- Yes.
-- Well ...
When you have old grandfather, Jack
maybe you have and you need to pee.
That's what you saw that I was doing.
Jack helps his grandfather.
Because it is old.
But he yelled so loud?
Not screaming, celebrating.
They shout with joy: "Hooray, Focker!"
Thank you for helping me to pee!
-- He was very happy. Right?
-- Yeah, right
-- Do you understand?
-- I think so.
Do not make use of this incident,
to distract me, Focker.
I know something about chicken and
I'm watching you.
Well, guess what? And I have eyes
so I'll be watching you
while
'll be watching me.
-- Okay?
-- Okay? That's correct.
Well.
-- We're watching both. Okay?
-- Okay.
I'm watching you right now.

Honey, I can not wait to see
Kevin's show today.
Yes ...
What are you doing?
We check the weather. Cold wind coming.
-- Do not ...
-- Yes ...
Thanks.
Greg!
Hey, how are you?
Sorry about the delay.
He was rushed to hospital.
Kevin showed us
property's wonderful.
Very nice.
So here you do not spend
are at the shelter for homeless people?
I split time between the two.
About 60% --40% here.
-- Really?
-- Now that Greg came, to show land.
-- Very nice.
-- It's perfect. I like it!
Thanks! Thanks!
How about that piece, Kevin?
It's perfect for racing to assemble land.
Why not put more castles right there
and make a trail for children
to walk between them?
I like the idea, Kevo.
Kevin, do you have a tattoo on his back?
Yes, Dina.
-- Seems quite prepared, we can see?
-- Yes, definitely.
Just out of curiosity.
God!
This is Pam?
Yes it is.
You know, after the episode Svetlana
I got drunk one night
and I woke up in a studio
Tattoo in Moscow.
I told the tattoo artist to me
the only woman picture
who always loved me unconditionally.
-- Pam.
-- My grandmother.
But being very drunk
I handed
Pam's picture by mistake.
Have a picture of Pam in your wallet?
Yes. Port travel photos with me
many friends and loved ones.
-- Do you have a picture with me?
-- Of course I have a picture with you.
You recognize this one here?
Yes, look at me ... somehow!
Interesting.
In fact, it is very flattering portrait, Pam.
-- Excuse me.
-- Jack ...
Prudence? Yes. Hello?
Awesome. Yeah, sure.
Thanks, PRU.
Prudence and was told that if
reach E.H. until three o'clock,
can arrange an interview.
-- Bravo, Kevin!
-- Thanks, Kevin.
I'm glad you came and you guys.
It's good when the grandparents have a role
education students in the Early Human.
Children need guidance.
It is your role, Jack?
To direct?
Yes, I see myself as a pastor
I refer the family that lives on pasture.
Yes, I'd say Jack
is a kind of honorary pastor,
a pastor of honor, if you will.
When my sheep astray,
I use
The way to keep the flock together.
There are many dynamic roles
The family that plays here!
Why do not we start the interview?
Okay, Henry, I want to empty your mind
and to draw a picture
the first thing you think
when you hear the word "family."
It's like when you go to an ophthalmologist.
Start at the top and down ...
Why give him a test
eye examination?
It's called Haising--Rick experiment.
I used to see the agency
level of intelligence of the recruits.
All letters are the same.
There is a real eye examination.
Outstanding sense of observation, Samantha.
E. .. E. .. E. ..
What did he say?
-- I have heard.
-- Something that is cool grandfather Jack ...
Tell me about your parents, Sam.
Tell me about your parents, Prudence.
That's my girl!
-- Would you tell me about your family?
-- My dad's a nice guy.
Thanks, buddy.
Grandpa Jack frightens him very much.
Do stupid things
when it's around.
Once, he tried to cut the turkey
Grandpa's knife,
escaped him and he cut his finger
and shouted: "Shit."
A crash interview.
She challenges him to crash these questions.
Anyway, Sam respond better to test.
Why, someone he inherits.
Who inherits, Jack?
Let's just say I did
twin research.
There is a theory
that in some cases a twin
receives an extra chromosome encodes
paternal,
and the other receives a chromosome
plus from the mother.
Sam can be
three quarters of the Byrnes family,
and Henry is likely to have a double dose
the Focker family.
So what is it?
Bernie My grandfather taught me that.
Pull my finger.
Double dose.
Let's go out to play.
What is free play test?
-- How to maimutareste the bar?
-- I do not think you understand, Greg.
You know how the prison guards
learn about the prisoners?
Studying them in the prison yard.
I'm sure Prudence
is now in her office
watching every move
they are kids.
-- Dad?
-- Yes?
Can you please let me climb that wall?
-- Yes, just be careful, buddy.
-- Okay.
-- You think you can do that?
-- What could be so hard?
I do not think you trust in His physical strength
also to face a wall.
Jack, do me a favor.
Loosen the reins a bit, okay?
I'll lose it, Greg, when
I'll show once and for all
that's what you need to drive.
I lead my family, right?
If I allowed Henry
climb a wall,
can climb on it.
If he wants to climb
the Empire State Building
and I say it's okay,
is wrong.
Because I'm in charge.
Okay? I agree.
So sit back
and accept that I can handle.
You are a very brave child!
Huh?
See, not very serious.
Only a minor fracture.
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Harry, are you okay?
Hey, I came as soon as I heard.
Prudence told me that they were small problems.
That is enough said.
Thanks Greg, can take
goodbye to a future education.
-- Jack
-- No, no, no ...
Prudence is a forgiving soul,
I think I can make things better.
Meanwhile, I have something for Hank The Tank!
Someone to keep your company
until you meet again with Arthur.
-- What is it?
-- Thanks, Dad Kevin!
-- Kevin Daddy?
-- Yes.
An old nickname when I was
in a fraternity.
I told Hank The Tank
that I may say so.
You are not Hank The Tank.
No one tells Hank The Tank.
-- Want to Be Daddy Greg?
-- No. I am Daddy Greg. I'm Greg.
I'm Greg's father,
so no need to be Daddy Greg.
-- Must ... sit next to him ...
-- Assistant Focker ...
-- Pam, you should talk for a minute.
-- Okay.
Mom?
-- Hey, Luis. What are you doing?
-- What are you, "dog"?
-- Look at two o'clock.
-- It's the superstar!
-- Hey!
-- Hello!
-- We have the best news.
-- Really?
Marketing Director saw
how well you did
the speech last night. Guess.
What?
He wants us to go to the convention
Foston on the drug,
in Maui next month.
Yes, it sounds great.
Frankly, I'm sorry,
are less concerned now
My son just broke his hand.
-- Poor child ...
-- Yes. So ...
-- You're a super dad.
-- No. There are a great dad.
It is very nice
how involved with your child.
No, this is what fathers,
there is nothing super ...
Luis how are you?
-- This is the book?
-- What? No! Go on, come on ...
It's over, right? I'm going now.
-- Sorry.
-- Someone is grumpy.
I will be concise, Pam, right?
Not getting any younger.
Dad ...
I want to make sure that there is somebody
except me
you can rely on fully.
There I could not help noticing
how you and Kevin
have become ever these last days.
Its financial security,
is great with the twins.
He has a heart of gold.
Maybe it's distasteful
the way they dress, but ...
but tattoos on his body ala
is an indication
that is definitely
open such an idea.
What idea?
The idea of a simple correction of the road.
A correction of the road?
Greg ... Kevin ...
Come on, Dad grumpy!
Come to Hawaii!
Okay, Daddy grumpy
will think about it.
-- Yes!
-- Okay.
Hey! Good, good!
Perfect.
Pam, it is Andy.
Andy, it is Pam, my wife.
Hey!
Glad to meet you.
And I'm glad to meet you.
Your husband is a star.
I'm sure you know how lucky you are.
-- Yes ...
-- I'm not. She is a star.
Mother is a star and ...
a star in all areas.
I'm just a fan who tries ...
you know, to them that guitar.
There ... you're ... star.
Everything is all right here?
Yes, Jack, everything is fine.
God!
You must be famous Jack Byrnes.
I heard a lot about you.
And I heard very little
about you, Miss Garcia.
But I admire your photos
since you were a cheerleader.
Henry feels much better.
Yamanon just sing an old song,
a brave warrior falls from tree
while chimpanzees hunt.
It's okay, yes.
-- Hello.
-- Hi, I'm Andy Garcia.
From Boston Pharmaceuticals.
And you're the doctor ... ?
-- No, not a doctor.
-- Not in the western meaning of the word.
In any sense.
You're a banker.
-- There are many things. I'm Kevin.
-- Hello.
Okay, great.
Well, I'll delete the one here.
Okay? Aloha.
I told you sell drugs
erection,
You told me not to and challenge.
That is ridiculous.
You also said that not leaving anything out.
Not leaving anything out?
Greg, that woman is amazing!
Mind, Kevin, because he did not
that Pam has become suspicious.
You saw how he struggled carotid artery
when he looks at her?
-- Spare me, Jack! Come ...
-- I'm talking about Pam.
Sorry, but you can not
trust this guy.
You can, at least once in your life
not to interfere in my marriage?
-- Come on, do not become hysterical.
-- Do not become hysterical.
He becomes hysterical.
-- Look, it's natural to be a little tempted.
-- There is no one tempted. No one is ...
Even our dear friend Buddha
had to go through the pain
in his path to enlightenment.
Dear friend Buddha ... what is he?
We have not seen much.
-- Do you ever listen?
-- I try not to do that.
I speak from the heart, as my friend BC
the Sermon on the Mount.
That I have always admired.
Well, I have news for you.
Not Jesus.
Maybe he is not Jesus
but is a much better option
Pam just for you, Greg.
-- Dad!
-- Sorry ...
Stop with the correction of the road.
What is the "right way"?
-- There is nothing.
-- I want to hear all about it, Jack.
Driving this family
to a rocky terrain, Focker.
And I, as captain of the vessel
a rudder toward safe water.
You know something? You're the captain, Jack.
We're human. There are
on a ship, we are in a hospital.
Okay? We are human beings in a hospital
and you're not captain.
Maybe I'm not captain, Gregory Focker,
but you're not nose Focker!
Welcome! Because I do not want to be
Focker nose shit!
I'm Greg Focker, Jack!
Okay? I'm Greg Focker!
By the way, Dr. Bob told me
I've given that his "job" it first.
It is good to know that I was
your second choice.
-- Have you talked to Dr. Bob?
-- Yes, we talked, Jack.
I drank beer with him last night
Convention is in town.
That's it. You're done. You're done.
You know, I can not say I have finished,
because I already quit!
-- I'll take off the wheel.
-- What wheel?
Wheel! Little hamster wheel that runs
that he could drink some water.
-- Begging your approval ...
-- What are you doing?
-- It's a metaphor about your approval.
-- Please, give me, Jack!
-- Yes, thank you cleared it.
-- The way the hamsters ...
-- What are you doing here, Kevin?
-- Trying to help.
Why not get on the boat guy huge
Russian women with those of your friends ...
and drinking Jello Shots
Deepak Chopra in his ass?
Deepak not involve him in it,
please, Greg.
Hey Dina! Jack suffered an attack
heart two weeks ago.
<i> Bye, folks! </ i>
Lower <i>. </ i>
-- Hello.
-- Hello.
-- Are you okay?
-- Yes ...
You need to take you by car?
<i>'m Pam, leave me a message. </ i>
Hey, I sleep in the house
the new one tonight, right?
I do not want to do with your father
this time.
Are you sure that you are well?
Yes. I need to rinse my thoughts.
-- Thanks for the ride.
-- No problem.
Why am I evil?
Greg was the one who was not honest.
Please, all he did was to tell Greg
that woman was not beautiful
that Pam was not jealous.
You know that.
And you did the same thing
the agent that
superb double in Helsinki
during the Cold War.
May you all take me for?
I told you, beauty
was a secret.
It was a matter of National Security.
Yes? As your heart disease?
Listen, Jack,
Greg cares about his family
as much as you care to you and yours.
Okay?
Pam?
Do not be upset!
I will not harass you,
but it seemed very sad.
You have to bring some goodies.
Thanks.
Some Chinese food, a little wine ...
Pam realized how great you are?
Yes, you know ...
I think he knows that they are great,
but you know ...
Everything changes when you have kids.
For everything
is focused around them.
Absolutely.
I'm sure you're thinking:
"Hello? Can I entertain myself?"
Yes. No, I mean, it's fun,
but in another way.
I'm gonna go get wine.
It is a distraction when you're alone
and you must wake up
at six o'clock
to prepare lunch for the children.
You know, this kind of fun.
I like, that are very nice.
Like the other day when Henry came ...
had a hat on his head and said:
"I'm mayor kitchen.
He wanted to be mayor?
From anywhere ... him that idea
she wants to be mayor.
He came and said:
"Look a proclamation.
You can not use the refrigerator. "
That day ...
I think I have a photo with him.
Yes, I'm ...
but he is very creative ...
I go out less
get some milk for the morning.
No, Jack.
We both know that's not true.
I do not know why you still believe
that you can hide something.
I'm going to find him Greg.
Let's bring home.
You know where?
I have an idea.
And as you know,
no nothing happened in Helsinki.
Here are the piece written by her
"Great Tropical.
They are very nice.
Yes, they are nice.
-- There you are!
-- Yes.
I am a marine algae that protects plants.
You know, I have to go home.
Yes, I understand perfectly.
Andy, no, no! No!
Andy, I think you have done
a wrong opinion. No.
I think ...
Greg, ever since I did that enema
type of hospital I wanted.
It was just an enema.
Seriously, I think idealizing an enema.
Hey, Andy, you know?
I think you drank too much wine.
Wine is good, Daddy!
I took a few pills Sustengo.
Got Sustengo? Why did you do that?
Andy, do not do it with tools.
Sustengo women is prohibited.
Together with Maysenoll,
warm up and makes you float ...
Maysenoll?
That is crazy.
I'll call a taxi.
Can I see pictures of your children?
Certainly not. You can not.
You must dress.
-- Do not be a grumpy dad!
-- There are grumpy ... must ...
No! No, no! Andy, give me the phone!
-- You want?
-- I want him.
-- Come take it ...
-- I want ...
Andy is not funny!
Let's go swimming!
Andy, no, not a pool.
-- It's a pool ...
-- No.
There is a hole.
Andy, do not do that.
Dress up, okay?
Andy, no!
That is not nice.
Do not throw the phones others in pits!
Okay?
You're wrong!
Andy dress. Come on!
I hate you!
Jump in the water!
I really do not know where is Greg?
We failed to find him.
I think they are not so good as I was.
Look who it is! There you are!
-- Hey, Kevin.
-- Kev ...
Good show.
Only once have such a celebrated.
Or two in this case.
I have a surprise, Jack.

-- It's what I think?
-- You better believe it!
Jinxy!
When I heard about your problems
health last night,
I knew I had to bring her here.
Kevin incredibly nice of you.
Thanks.
Why is not Daddy here?
Because I was mean to him?
No, baby. Not because of that.
Because his grandfather was wrong with him.
But to come. I'll come.
-- Will be here, right?
-- Okay.
So, let's have fun!
Come, go, to see what it is.
Wait a minute.
Gay!

Why are you so dirty?
-- Where is everybody?

Hi, Daddy!
He took more pills

I broke all spending.
It's my fault.

It is because the nervous system.
Flamenco dancing is very sexual.
As you know, not anything wrong with it.
I know that.
We Focker family. So we're doing.
But I know that something went wrong
family. Are you okay?
Yes. You know, just ordinary things with Jack.
Are you okay?
Your mother was right, menopause
makes me behave like a fool.
You know, I feel a little naughty ...
-- Byrnes Grandma! Byrnes Grandma!
-- God!
Look up! My Little!
Look at you, dear ...
You are very beautiful!
Do you mind if we sit down, dear,
to talk a little?
Need to talk.
So ... I heard

Not true?
Well, let me tell you
something about men, Samantha.
They ... Her ... are taught to be tough
and strong, you know?
But inside is very soft and ...
tacky, and cannoli ...

Not exactly, is more like ...
Peanut butter and jelly.
Inside the bread toasted.
Once you know it,
can be more forgiving with them.
Besides, I have plenty of time

It will be like clay in your hands.
-- Okay.

Well. Okay, thanks.

Can you put your foot down slowly?
An old injury from sex.

Hey, Jack.
It's great. A great design.
It is ... captures the intensity ...
It's just like you.
Okay, look.
Last night I think we both said
things you regret.
Perhaps it would have to say anything
About Dr. Bob
but you said that thing
about the "correct way", so ...
Anyway, I offer you a piece of cake.
Shit!
Jack, are you okay?
Jack, I'm sorry. Jack, you okay?
Well, Focker ...
At least you do this to be funny.
Jack, do not do that. Come ...
This is the beginning, Greg.
All right, "to dance."
Come ...
Jack?
Where are you? Jack!
Jack?
Get out of here!
Get out! Get out!
-- Come on, baby.
-- Get out!
Get out! Get out!
Jack!
I saw you last night
Andy Garcia!
No nothing happened!
I was in the wilderness for so long,
so maybe it's time to get back home.
But where is "home"?
Dear, "home" is inside you.
What did you look there
is right here inside.
-- In your heart?
-- No, in your heart.
-- In my heart?
-- Yes, Kevin!
Support!

Thanks.
I know you will find the path
Believe me, dear.
Because of the strength of a lion
and soul of a poet.
Pink?
Bernie, what are you doing here?
-- What are you doing here?
-- This guy has some problems, baby.
Bernard, I swear, is not as it seems.
Your wife console me
in a moment of sadness.
My soul has been lying to her.
Your soul, or language?
-- There was no tongue involved.
-- It was a little bit.
Thank you for your honesty.
I think you're in Spain, baby.
What happened?
What happened?
We went half way around the world
Flamenco has been mastered,
but something was missing.
My dance partner.
Bernie ...
You're my north.
How long will we be together,
I will not get lost again.
What beautiful replica ...
Come here, baby.
It is wonderful.
What about full of electricity ...
Want to leave me here to kiss his wife?
Sure. Yeah, sure.
Jinx!
Grandpa Jack!
Jack?

Well, relax, I'll watch.

-- It'll be okay.
-- Bernie ...
-- Okay, I'm here.
Well. Jack, you have drugs on you?
-- Greg, do not respond to my treatment.
-- Really?
To get your hands on top of him?
There is a magic card, Kevin.
-- Pam, call 911.
-- Okay.
Kevin, you go up in the house
to see if you have aspirin?
Aspirin.
It's okay.
Jinx!
Arthur!
Thanks, Dad!
Relax, Jack.
It will be okay.
-- Well ...
-- I promise.
He took no other medication?
Only aspirin about 15 minutes.
Thanks, asistentule.
You did well.
We'll take it from here.
By the way, where have all the bruises
and those scratches?
It's a long story.
We were in the inflatable castle
and was prevented and ...
I understand.
My father has been "prevented"
and went through a pane of glass
at my wedding last year.
All right, let it get in the car.
It will be okay.
We'll take care of your husband
One you get in the car.
I know you told the truth
in touch with Andy, Greg.
-- Really?
-- Yes.
Carotid pulse was stable
when you have pleaded innocence.
Sure. Of course.
-- Greg?
-- Yes?
I never ever wanted Dr. Bob.
But you.
Always on.
Relax and remain silent, Mr. Byrnes.
See you there, right?
Hey Focker!
Why do we swear?

-- I hope not.
Do you have condoms in those music

Second round?
God, baby ...

Okay. Any other slower song?

This is a gift

Yes.
What is it, Grandpa Bernie?
I took with me my entire life.
-- It's my personal bubble of gas.
-- What is?
Are you kidding?
Jack. Lift leg.
Jack, come on ...
Shoot winds!
Jack, you have to laugh at things
that make us human, huh?
What is this?
What is this? That is your own yamulka!
One of those that wear them Jews.
We know that you're concerned about genealogy,
so when you care,
I took the opportunity when you sleep
to you some of your pubic hairs.
I've sent to a laboratory
DNA analysis.
What have you done?
We thought it would be fun
to identify your ancestors.
Yes and proved, Jack T. Byrnes
Israeli're at a rate of 1 / 23.
Welcome to the tribe, Jack!
I'm not sure about that.
Yes, yes. Write right here.
Believe me, is on the table.
-- That means you have to be circumcised?
-- No.
It is painful when you're an adult.
Although you contradict what you found
will appreciate the gesture.
Thank you, Bernard, Rose.
-- You're welcome, Yakov.
-- Your name in Hebrew.
-- Yakov?
-- Yakov.
Yakov!
Well, listen. Greg, we're in your home
you're the boss here
so why not keep a toast?
Sure ...
Honestly, Jack ...
I have no desire to try to look
I am in any way boss in this house.
But I love our family
very, very much.
And they are very happy
that we can all here ...
weekend.
Then we split up
I will get back to your homes
in your states. Cheers!
-- Cheers!
-- Cheers!
In fact, baby ...
Your father and I have something to say ...
Gaylord, we move to Chicago!
No, seriously.
We sold the property.
I just bought a house near you.
It is not that great?
-- No! There is great!
-- No, no ...
If they will move here
and then we'll move here.
Welcome! We live together.
As one big happy family.
No! I will not ...
No, Jack, do not move anyone.
Because no one moves.
Huh?
No one here is moving!
