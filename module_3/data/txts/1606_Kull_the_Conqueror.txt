[Yelling]
[Yells,Grunts]
-[Whinnies]
-Hah! Hah!
[Yelling]
[HornBlowing]
-Youfightwell.
-Thankyou,sir.
So,youwanttobeasoldier
in my Dragon Legion.
I'vepassed
all yourtests.
No, no. Not all.
This... is for chopping wood!
A barbarian tool.
[ Soldiers Laughing ]
This--
yes--
is for waging war.
A nobleman's blade.
Hah!
[ Laughing ]
You!
Hah!
[ Grunting ]
You give away
your position. Hah!
- So do you!
- [ Laughing ]
Silence!
- [ Pants ]
- [ Yelling ]
[ Chuckling ]
Perhaps you should
go back to your ax.
[ Chuckles ] Ah, don't feel bad.
Few men can hold their own against me.
[ Laughing, Sighs ]
Who are you?
Kull... of Atlantis.
Atlantis?
You're wasting
your time here.
Every man in my legion
is of noble blood.
My blood's red
as any man's.
[ Chuckling ]
Take heart, Kull. There's a place
in this world for all of us.
- General Taligaro!
- Even a barbarian like yourself.
- General Taligaro!
- [ Horse Neighs ]
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Laughing ]
General Taligaro,
the palace is in chaos.
The king is slaughtering
his heirs.
[ Kull ]
Noble blood...
all over the palace floor.
[ Men Y elling, lndistinct ]
[ Horse Neighing ]
Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!
Faster! Faster!
Whoa!
What have you done, Borna?
My elders challenged me
for the throne,
so I've spared all my children
any future disappointment!
This is madness, sire.
Taligaro, so you, too,
will have my crown.
You want it.
Take it! Here!
Take it!
There'll be no more blood
spilled tonight, except your own
if you insist on it.
Treason!
[ Laughing ]
I spare your life tonight.
[ Grunting, Groaning ]
The crown, Kull.
Give it to me.
It's my birthright.
Succession falls to me. Give it to me.
[ Man ]
Hold!
I am next in line, cousin!
-[ Flesh Searing ] Ahh!
-Lords, points of law must be clarified.
- The crown is mine!
- [ King Borna ] No!
It's mine.
And I give it to--
I give it to you, Kull.
Here! Take it.
And keep it if you can.
[ Laughing, Choking ]
The sacred law of succession--
undeniable and irreversible.
- Long live the king.
- Long live the king.
Long live the king.
[ Soldiers ]
Long live the king!
Long live Kull.
[ Whispering ]
Sire, you, you no longer
need bow to anyone.
- My king.
- Sire.
Borna's harem,
Your Majesty.
[ Chattering ]
And now yours.
Indulge me, Tu.
Even a king should bow
to the ladies.
Down.
You still read
the hands of fate.
You read them for me once.
"King by the hand of a king," remember?
I'm surprised you remember, milord.
You were very drunk.
Silence!
You are insolent.
[ Chuckles ]
But honest.
Yes, I was drunk,
though I do remember.
Borna had a fit because I grabbed you
about the waist and tried to kiss you.
You did kiss me,
and it wasn't my waist you grabbed.
[ Chuckles ]
What is your name?
Zareta.
Ah.
Bring your cards
to my chambers, Zareta.
Leave us.
- Shall I undress, sire?
- No. Shuffle.
Unfold my kingdom's destiny
in the cards.
First, the hand
of the spirit.
- The tiger.
- That's my totem.
- I was called "the Tiger"
when I was a pirate.
- A sign of majesty and power.
Next, the hand of being.
A quest.
My whole life has been a quest.
The hand of destiny.
Destiny.
The kiss.
The fate of your kingdom
will be found within a kiss.
A kiss?
Is that so?
Shall I undress now?
Are you in a hurry?
I am whatever you wish.
My women don't play games.
I'm not your woman.
I'm your slave.
[ Both Grunting ]
Tu was right.
You are insolent.
- But honest.
- I do not take women
against their will.
As long as they come to you on command
and not by choice, how will you know?
I'll do my best to satisfy you
in the bedchamber now,
but do not mistake compliance
for enthusiasm.
The destiny of a slave
is to submit.
Now, shall I undress?
I don't need to be taught
a slave's destiny.
I learned that lesson chained to the oar
of a pirate galley.
For five long years,
I learned.
Tonight I sleep alone.
[ Door Rattles ]
Your Majesty.
Hear me now. All slaves of Valusia
shall be set free, starting with my own.
You, go home.
I am home, Majesty.
I was born here
in the palace.
Oh. Well, from now on,
you will receive a fair wage.
You, where are you from?
Zalgara, Your Majesty.
You wish to go home?
- Well, do so now. You're free.
- Kull!
Free Valusians have a right
to own slaves under the law.
The law is changed.
Sire, look, um, for thousands of years,
this law has been on this stone.
It was carved by our forefathers,
and it may not be altered.
No matter how cruel
or unjust the law?
The law is greater
than any king, uh,
and as Royal Eunuch,
I am sworn to protect it.
[ Groans ]
[ Cheering ]
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Freedom!
- [ Whip Slashing ]
- [ Man Shouting ]
Our days are numbered!
The force of the people never rests.
Your time is short, too, Mandara.
Mandara.
Who is this man?
Ascalante,
High Priest of Valka.
He was trying to reopen his temple.
He was exiled by King Borna for heresy.
No! For speaking
Valka's truth.
Valka allows the unholy flame to burn
as a reminder of godless times...
and as an omen
of things to come.
Nonsense!
- Release him.
- You can't!
Is there some ancient law
which prevents this too?
If so, tell me now.
Until then, let men worship
what gods they will.
- [ People Cheering ]
- Reopen your temple, priest.
[ Cheering Continues ]
- You're going too fast, Kull.
- Not fast enough.
Long live Kull!
- The staff goes in the other hand.
- Oh.
Long live Kull!
Long live Kull!
- Long live Kull!
- Members of the Royal Court,
people of Valusia.
For centuries the Topaz Throne...
has been the center
of all the world's power,
and now, I give you
your new king.
Long live Kull!
Long live Kull!
Long live Kull!
[ Screaming ]
Enemy spies, Your Majesty,
no doubt sent from Commoria.
No doubt.
You sent for me, sire?
Yes. To say good-bye.
Good-bye?
I will not command
your affections, Zareta.
You're free to go.
We'll all be damned.
I choose to stay.
Why?
To be king is to be alone.
Today's event made that clear.
I am used to court intrigue, sire.
I can help you. I--
Is this the only reason you stay?
Tonight, I sleep alone.
I do go too fast.
[ Thunderclap ]
Where is he?
[ Horse Neighing ]
It's about time, Taligaro.
Why have you summoned us
to this evil place?
I didn't. I received a note
marked with our sign.
As did we, cousin,
but if none of us sent it--
- Someone knows of our plot
against the king.
- [ Man ] That's right.
And why it has failed.
Enaros.
I'd heard rumors of your ghost
haunting the city.
I've had no need
for the company of men.
But I see you still crave
the flame's embrace.
"Let men worship
what gods they will."
Isn't that what
your new king said?
- [ Growling ]
- Wizard, what do you want now?
I've come to help with your plot
to kill the barbarian king.
How?
You can't slay this tiger
with mere weapons.
You have to trap him first.
[ Enaros ] Finally,
the time has come for ancient
Acheron's long-dead nobility.
[ Hissing ]
[ Grunting ]
Akivasha, the Red Witch.
There she is,
the sorceress queen
of ancient Zakerof.
Let's see.
The left breast
above her heart.
The scroll!
The scroll spoke true.
[ Growling, Grunting ]
- Akivasha's blood.
- [ Growls ]
Kanah maya kalunia
gud gamesh.
Kanah maya kalunia
gud gamesh!
Return, O Queen!
Acheron's kiss--
kiss of the sacred flame--
Iet it fire your soul.
Awake. Awake and rise.
And live!
Live! And rule!
Ohh, Akivasha.
Akivasha? Akivasha.
You are Akivasha. Remember?
O Queen.
The sacred flame of Acheron
that's burned since your time.
- And my kingdom?
- Gone,
but the scroll foretold that you
would rise and reclaim the Topaz Throne.
And so you shall,
with my help.
And then,
six days from that time,
darkness will shroud
the Earth...
and Acheron
will rise again.
- Who are you?
- Enaros, your humble servant,
who's devoted his life
to your return.
[ Moans ]
The world has much changed
during your long sleep.
Too long a sleep.
[ Taligaro ]
Good morning, king.
Today, you'll meet
the finest people in all Valusia.
Who knows?
Perhaps you'll find your queen here.
- My queen?
- Yes, yes.
You can have your choice. A proper
marriage would appease the nobility.
I can have
any woman I want?
- [ Chuckling ]
- Your Majesty.
Good morning, sire.
Uh, come. Take your place
for the presentation.
You see, milord, every noble
has brought the prize of his house.
Fanara, from the House of Ballin.
As pure as virgin snow.
- We've met. She's not that pure.
- Shh.
- My niece, eunuch.
- Nalissa,
niece of Ducalon,
came to pay homage, sire.
[ Akivasha's Voice Echoing ]
Come to me. Be my lover. Queen.
The next girl, sire.
Sire, the next girl.
Take off your veil.
- Let me see your face.
- Oh.
Protocol does not permit.
The king... makes protocol.
[ Echoing ]
Make love to me now.
Milord, the others.
There are no others.
[ Echoing ]
I am yours.
Mmm.
- My queen!
- [ Cheering ]
My Queen.
A toast to the king and queen.
May your wedding night
last longer than your courtship.
And may fate smile
on you both.
Well, let's see.
Zareta, come tell us our fate.
- Zareta.
- [ Cards Drop ]
- What are you doing here?
- Borna is dead.
Haven't you heard?
I've missed you.
You are mad to come back.
[ Sighs ]
Not long ago, I was just a pirate.
Today I am king, and I have one
of the loveliest of noblewomen.
Who'd have thought it?
I thought it.
- Really?
- It was in the cards.
Sit. Divine our future.
Will you choose?
Oh, why worry for tomorrow,
when we know our destiny tonight?
No!
- You mustn't!
- [ Chuckles ] Ow.
[ People Gasping ]
Your plaything
is jealous, husband.
- It's nothing. It's--
- This is the destiny you chose..
the death card.
Must I publicly compete
for your affection with a palace whore?
- Away.
- The cards do not lie!
- You forget your place.
- No!
- Let go!
- [ People ] Ohhh!
- You okay?
- It seems our priest here
fancies you, Zareta.
Perhaps you'd like to go
with this... admirer.
I will stay
and serve the king.
Enough! Tonight is my wedding night.
Everyone must share our joy.
[ Cheering ]
[ Akivasha Moaning, Gasping ]
[ Echoing ] Y es.
- Ahh.
- Nalissa.
Come. Kiss your bride.
[ Chokes ]
[ Screaming ]
He's dead!
He's dead!
[ Sobs ]
It wasn't the wine.
I had some.
But poison, yes. How?
Who?
The whore!
[ Soldier ]
This way! Inside!
[ Women Screaming ]
[ Bleating ]
You've done well.
You've honored our pact,
and when I am king,
you will be richly rewarded.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Growls ]
Psst.
You like the flame's embrace?
You shouldn't play with fire, Enaros.
It holds so many painful memories.
[ Screaming ]
Oh, my hand! My hand!
- [ Chuckles ]
- Restore it!
Make it whole again!
No! It will remind you
who is master.
What are you, witch?
I am queen...
thanks to you.
What do you want?
I want you, husband.
I was going to kill you,
but after last night--
Join me.
I will make you immortal,
and the Earth shall be
our empire.
[ Echoing ]
You are mine.
I would rather die.
[ Screams ]
So be it.
Do it! Slowly.
By the grace of Valka, I will send you
back to the darkest pit of hell!
Don't waste your prayers, dog.
Soon hell will be coming to us.
You are ugly.
Your Majesty!
I suspected foul doings.
I rejoice to find you alive.
Of course I'm alive.
I've escaped grimmer dungeons than that.
All of Valusia believes
you've been murdered.
Zareta is to be executed
for the crime.
When I get my hands
on the bitch demon,
I will rip out
her evil heart.
She won't be so easy to kill.
This mark burns on her breast.
What is it?
The coin of ancient Acheron.
Your queen was once queen
of that evil empire...
when the world was cloaked in darkness
and demons ruled over men.
The Red Witch?
Your bride is over
3,000 years old.
- She said she was 19.
- She is Akivasha reborn.
From the Topaz Throne
she will bring back ancient Acheron...
and open the gates of hell.
"The fate of your kingdom
will be found within a kiss."
Comfy?
Fleas.
Halt! Hold.
Hold it there.
A guard, Your Majesty.
Get away from there!
Come on. Move.
[ Sighing ]
- Go. Outta my way.
- Excuse me.
[ Groaning ]
[ Man ] You killed the king.
You must die!
[ Crowd Booing ]
Let's go.
[ People Yelling, Booing ]
[ Sniffing ]
Something stinks.
Well, it's not me.
It's me.
[ Horn Blowing ]
[ Horn Continues ]
[ Tu ]
Ach, the stench!
I think the body's gone ripe.
It's a good thing
we're burning it.
A bit more liberal
with that incense.
May this dog suffer
an eternity of pain.
- But not today!
- [ Crowd Screams ]
Stop him!
Hopeless.
Watch out!
- Head for the temple!
- This way! This way!
Let's go! Hurry!
Who is it?
Who else?
[ Laughs ]
You desire him.
- My passion burns, slave.
- [ Screaming ]
Close the gate!
[ Kull ]
Faster! Get inside.
Hurry!
[ lndistinct Yelling ]
Go, go, go!
- Out of my way.
- Don't let him out!
- [ Screaming ]
- [ Kull ] Keep going!
Not good.
[ Grunts ]
Damn!
Oh, shit!
[ Y elling ]
Oof! Ohh.
- The passage!
- Stop! In the queen's name,
Iay down your arms.
In the king's name,
lay down yours.
Kull lives.
[ Soldier Muttering ]
Your Majesty! Sire!
Your Highness.
Get up! I say to you,
Kull is dead.
And never again will a foreigner
sully our throne. Impostor!
Traitor!
On your feet.
[ Yells ]
Go!
Ascalante!
- What are you doing?
- I can't take a man's life.
- Now you tell me?
- [ Yelling ]
Put that down! Go!
Go! Go!
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.
Hey! Just who is
this priest to you?
My brother.
Brother?
Her brother? Good.
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyah!
Are you deceitful
or just clumsy?
You betrayed me.
He's not here.
You said he was dead!
Remember your place!
My place is on the throne.
What game is this
you're playing?
The dog knows a few tricks,
that's all.
Find him, kill him,
and then we'll rule together.
No. That was not part
of our pact.
I have altered our pact.
Pray I do not alter it further.
Move out!
First we deal with Kull.
Then we'll see her festering
in her grave where she belongs.
[ Ascalante ]
The port of Tatheli.
From here
we must sail north,
find the lsle of lce
and bring back the breath of Valka.
The breath of Valka
is just a myth.
For centuries men have searched for it,
but no man has ever found it.
- It doesn't exist.
- It does exist.
Only Valka's breath can extinguish the
flame which flows in Akivasha's veins.
If you fail,
Valusia is doomed.
Whoa.
- Stay here.
- [ Both ] Where are you going?
To see an old friend.
[ Men Haggling ]
Excuse my partner.
H-He doesn't know what he is saying.
All right. Yeah.
It's good.
Hey! Kull! Kull!
- They told me you were dead.
- Uh, they tried.
But here I am,
drinking your wine.
It's good wine too.
Oh, Kull, you haven't changed
at all, my friend.
Come, you bulging bag
of muscle and hair.
Come. Talk to me.
Pucci, cocktails.
It's good to see you, Juba.
Look at this place.
It's, uh, not like the old days.
Well, I've gotten rich
off pirates like you.
You know what they say..
You can never have too much money...
or too many good friends.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't see any friends.
So, come on, Kull.
We're back in business, right?
[ Sighs ]
I need a favor.
What do you want, a woman?
Pucci!
- No.
- What, two women?
- Ten women?
- No women.
No women? Kull!
Have you got a problem?
Juba.
I need a ship.
Well, here she is,
my fastest ship.
Take her, my friend.
She's yours.
Why don't you come with us?
Oh, Kull, you know
I hate the smell of fish.
I insist.
We have a lot
of catching up to do.
Captain.
Sail north.
Wake up, scum!
Prepare to row!
The wind is up.
Unfurl the sails.
Do it.
Ship the oars!
Don sails!
[ Knocking ]
He sailed from Tatheli,
headed due north.
He seeks the lsle of lce.
He seeks the breath of Valka.
No man has ever found it.
Kull is no ordinary man.
Taligaro, you must stop him.
With my help,
you can defeat him.
Now, first,
you must prepare a ship.
Where do I sail?
Leave that to me.
Obey and you will share in glories
far beyond your earthly ambitions.
- Yes?
- Power, immortality.
Do my bidding.
Share my throne.
Yes, my Queen.
Bitch.
The breath of Valka! Fool.
The world could have been yours, Kull.
I could have been yours.
[ Akivasha ]
Blow, winds of hellfire!
Blow! Send my swift destruction
across the sea.
Oh!
[ Gagging ]
[ Laughing ]
Can I do anything for you?
I'm fine.
Don't love where there's
no hope, sister.
Food.
[ Grunts ] You?
Come, my precious flower.
You'll feel better
if you have something to eat.
You like fish eye?
No fish eye.
Okay, bring on the meat.
Forget the hors d'oeuvres.
Come eat, my friends. Eat.
There's always plenty to eat at Juba's.
Come and feast, my friends.
Forgive me, sire.
Where are my manners?
Eating before the king.
Where are your brains?
Eating before Juba.
What? Well, you think--
Oh, Kull, you're breakin' my heart.
You think I'd poison you?
[ Chuckling ]
Of course not.
- See, it's not deadly.
It's just a little dry.
- Well, then,
some wine to wash it down.
- Absolutely. To your health.
- No, no, no.
To yours. Drink up.
[ Groaning ]
Come, my friends.
Don't be silly.
Eat, drink,
fill yourselves.
Oh, Kull.
Things... have just not
been the same...
since you and l--
[ Groans ]
[ Groaning ]
It's okay, Zareta.
You'll get your sea legs
in a day or two.
- [ Grunts ]
- [ Grunts ]
[ Juba ]
Hey! Hey.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Ahh. Finally awake.
Ohh.
[ Laughing ]
Oh. You got nice equipment.
Think I'll get
a nice price for that.
Well, you certainly did make
a pig of yourself last night.
By the way, the food
was not poisoned. It was drugged.
Oh, your queen's gonna be happy
to see you when we dock in Valusia.
I think you're gonna
make me a nice profit.
Meanwhile, you can earn your keep
here at the oars.
I'm sure you can pick it up
again in no time.
- What have you done with Zareta?
- Oh, her.
Bring the fine young lady.
Come. Bring her.
[ Muttering ]
- Yes, bring her.
Bring her, bring her, bring her.
- Let go of me.
Maybe I could, uh,
sell her too.
You know, I think
she cleans up very nicely.
You dog!
Why, you--
You are not fit to wear
a fine lady's things.
Dangle her in the drink.
[ Screaming ]
[ Laughing ]
I'll kill you.
I don't think so.
- Those ropes are strong.
- [ Yelling ]
- Mmm.
- Pity your ship isn't.
Where's that sword?
Where's that sword?
[ Yelling ]
Kull. Kull, come on. It's me.
No, I was jokin'. It was a joke.
Come on. Oh, boy,
you should've seen your face.
You should see yours.
Ohh.
Kull!
Pull out the knife.
Pull it!
Kull! I can't swim!
- I can't swim!
- Zareta!
Don't go anywhere!
Hang on!
- [ Crack ]
- [ Screaming ]
[ All ]
Down here! Down here!
Come on!
[ Metal Clanging ]
[ Neck Cracking ]
Not bad, priest. No!
Zareta!
[ Groaning ]
- Where the hell have you been?
- Busy.
Give me your hand.
Thuron! Run our course.
Sail north.
Aye, Tiger.
[ Laughing ]
Hey, Kull!
You can come back now!
- Kull!
- [ Men Screaming ]
?? [ Fanfare ]
[ Crowd Murmuring ]
Citizens of Valusia,
rest assured that we will find the whore
who murdered our beloved king...
and the impostor
that keeps her from justice.
We will have their blood!
[ Cheering ]
And know this..
Kull's legacy will not die.
I will lead Valusia
into the future,
and our kingdom
shall reign supreme!
[ Cheering ]
What's wrong?
[ Enaros ] You squander
your affections on unworthy men,
when the one who
brought you back from the dead...
remains your devoted servant.
Enaros.
You forget your place.
[ Shuddering ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Screaming ]
The lsle of lce.
[ Kull ] The wind is up!
Raise the sail!
- Man the oars!
- Man the oars!
[ Boatswain ]
Keep rowing!
She should be
in regal robes, not bearskins.
She wasn't born a slave,
Your Majesty.
Borna sentenced me to death for heresy,
but Zareta begged him for mercy.
She traded her virtue
and freedom for my life.
[ Kull ]
Put some more torches on the deck!
[ Shouting, lndistinct ]
Keep your eyes open!
- [ Shivering ]
- Soon.
- [ Crashing ]
- [ Yelling ]
- [ Wood Splintering ]
Ascalante!
[ Men Groaning ]
Steer away!
[ Kull ]
The ships that never returned!
Give me your hand!
There! The cave!
- Ascalante!
- I'm all right.
Valka!
Kull! Look!
"What was false must be true.
Cause be the carrier
of Valka's might...
to defy unholy flame."
What does it mean?
Ascalante.
The praying maiden.
"Cause be the carrier."
- Zareta!
- Zareta!
Ascalante! Wait!
"Cause be the carrier."
Akivasha was the cause!
A woman!
Only a woman will bring forth
the breath of Valka!
Tiger! Tiger! Tiger!
- [ Screaming ]
- Kull!
I kneel before you, Valka,
to pray for your son Kull,
whom I love,
and though I am not pure,
my love is strong.
Come, barbarian!
I'm yours.
[ Screaming ]
I see you've yet to master
a nobleman's blade.
[ Groaning ]
[ Zareta ] Let me be the carrier
of your might!
Let me extinguish the flame
that mocks your rage!
[ Gasping ]
Zareta!
Zareta, speak to me.
It is inside of her.
The breath of Valka.
So... so cold.
Zareta. Zareta must stand
in the flame of Acheron.
That is how Akivasha
will be vanquished.
You can't have her.
Hah!
[ Groaning ]
[ Fierce Yell ]
Huh?
Ascalante!
Finish what you started, priest.
- [ Groaning ]
- No!
- [ Grunting ]
- No!
You can't win.
You already lost!
Everyone and everything you hold dear
is doomed because of you--
an arrogant dog
who would be king!
Come here!
Zareta!
Kull!
[ Gasping ]
[ Groans ]
Ascalante!
Kull, if Zareta dies,
the breath of Valka
will be lost forever,
and Valusia will become
a living hell.
She loves you very much.
Such love was wasted on a fool!
I was blinded by pride
and greedy dreams of nobility,
and now a kingdom
will pay the price.
Let me look at you.
Cold to the touch.
Ah.
The flame dies.
Ah, yes, the priest was right.
You will stand in the unholy fire
until it burns no more.
- Take her away.
- Sir.
Now, I will destroy
the lying witch...
and take my rightful place as king.
After all we've done
in Valka's name, look.
Your god laughs at us.
[ Fierce Yell ]
[ Yelling ]
Forgive me, Valka.

[ Banging, Door Bursting Open ]
- Ducalon.
- Your Majesty,
your proclamation has caused
unrest among the nobles.
The nobles?
Did you really think I'd step down?
Hmm?
- What is this?
- The future.
All I wanted was to be king!
It was my right!
- Hmm.
- What did you dredge up out of hell?
I have bartered my soul,
and Valusia is lost.
Yes, and Acheron
will be Acheron again.
The past will be restored.
I shall make you the past.
Witch!
Hmm.
Enaros, help me.
- Help me!
- Not me, fool.

[ Crowd Clamoring ]
- [ Exclaiming ]
- [ Man ] What's happening?
It is done, my Queen.
[ Moaning ]
- Mistress.
- It is time.
[ Gasps ]
Kull?
Kull!
- lmpossible!
- No. Stop him! Kill him!
Or suffer my wrath!
Sacred flame,
protect us from the cold!
Hurry, Mistress.
Cause be the carrier.
The Topaz Throne
is mine, witch!
I take what is my due,
and now I give you yours.
[ Shrieking ]
[ Screaming, Gasping ]
- The flame does not die.
- No!
The flame does not die!
[ Cackling ]
No, Valka.
She must not die.
She must not die!
You're still a barbarian, Kull.
[ Groaning ]
[ Screaming ]
[ Demonic Voice ]
Kull!
You have failed, Kull!
You have all failed!
The breath of Valka
has died with her, and in moments,
I will be invincible!
[ Roaring ]
[ Laughing ]
Kull!
A kiss. A kiss.
[ Shrieking ]
Husband.
[ Low Growl ]
Husband.
Come kiss your bride.
Y es. A kiss.
[ Roaring ]
Husband.
You're so cold.
Cold!
[ Screaming ]
The fate of my kingdom
will be found within a kiss!
[ Shrieks ]
- [ Groaning ]
- Back!
Her life for the crown!
Hey, hey, hey!
The crown!
[ Fierce Yell ]
[ Groaning ]
That's how a barbarian fights!
[ Crowd Cheering ]
Give me that.
[ Giggling ]
People of Valusia,
now I give you your new king!
- [ Crowd ] Hail!
- M-Milord, milord.
Sire? Uh, sire, sire.
Uh, uh, uh, sire?
All slaves of Valusia
are now free.
- [ Crowd Cheering ]
- Oh! No, no, no!
But the laws! Oh!
The laws! The laws!
Take this.
- Move! Move!
- The harem is dispersed.
The king commands
no one's affections.
No.
Don't kneel to me.
I should kneel to you, my Queen.
A common girl, sir?
- The woman I love.
- B-B-But, my liege, she's a-a--
- She is not of noble birth.
- Nor am l.
It's a good thing too.
From our loins, Valusia will be
reborn red-blooded and strong.
But, milord--
- Oh!
- If you don't like my kingship,
come take the throne.
By this ax, I rule.
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
Long live the king!
