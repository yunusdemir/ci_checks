<i>SUBTITLES BY LUIS-SUBS</i>
<i>Hey, Jas, you awake?</i>
Jason?
Jason, you awake?
Yeah, been up for hours.
Just getting dressed.
You finish your English paper?
I did it last night.
Did you eat your oatmeal?
Yeah. Thanks, Mom.
It was delicious.
Here you go, Trooper.
Nice board, Shepherd.
Bret,
I'd love to stay and be physically
and emotionally abused by you guys,
but I should get to school.
Ow.
I had a feeling you were an
excellent bully, and I was right.
Take it easy.
Give me the skateboard.
You sure? Because now you're going from
harmless bully to hardened boardjacker.
You don't want that, do you?
I assume everyone completed their
creative writing assignments.
Read your assignments in a
slow and peaceful manner.
You, Joshua. Go.
My dog ate it?
I know you don't have a dog.
Right. Sorry.
Ms. Caldwell?
Yes, Kaylee.
Can you open the door?
It's kind of toasty in here.
I suppose so.
Jason Shepherd. Did you just
come in from that window?
No, you looked a little flushed.
I was just creating a cross-draft.
Now that we're all comfortable,
why don't you read us your story?
Let's give someone else a chance.
No, I think we'd all
like to hear yours.
You did do it, didn't you?
Ms. Caldwell.
Can I call you Phyllis?
No.
Understood.
But, as much as I wanted
to write my paper,
I mean I really, really wanted
to write my paper, I couldn't.
I spent all last night in the
Greenbury General emergency room.
See, my mom made Swedish
meatballs for dinner.
My dad's favorite. He was so excited,
he accidentally swallowed one whole.
It was awful. He started choking.
His face turned purple.
The meatball was literally
bulging out his neck.
We rushed him to the ER.
I tried to write it in the waiting
room, but it was too hard.
I needed to be by my father's side.
After all, he's the only dad I got.
You're lying through your
teeth, you little demon.
I wish I were.
Call my dad if you want.
His number is 555-0147.
I think I will.
Are you crazy? You're totally
going to get busted.
Say, "Harry Shepherd's office."
No way.
Help me out!
What can I do?
How about write the paper?
Do it.
No!
Harry Shepherd's office.
One moment, please.
Hello?
Hello, Ms. Caldwell.
Yes, it's true.
It was terrifying.
I started to see the white light.
I was just about to cross
over to the other side
when I heard an angel's
voice calling out.
When I opened my eyes
I saw my sweet, sweet
Jason standing over me.
I said, "Back off, Grim Reaper.
"I ain't done living yet."
And with every ounce of gas
I had left in my body,
I burped that meatball
right across the room.
And I owe it all to my son.
I'm sorry, Ms. Caldwell.
I should stop talking now.
My throat is still
very sore. Thank you.
Jason?
I am so sorry.
You just take your time
handing in that assignment.
Thank you.
Now back to those creative essays.
You, Trevor. Go.
Jason! Just who I was looking for.
I need to see you in here.
I would love to hang out
and chat with you, Ms. C,
but I've got to go home and
help take care of my dad.
Oh, really?
<i>How could you lie to us, Jas?</i>
You told me you wrote that paper.
I don't know.
Unfortunately, that essay counts for
one-third of Jason's semester grade.
Without it, he'll fail the class.
He'll have to repeat
the course in summer school.
What?
I can't go to summer school!
There must be something
he can do to make it up.
I'm teaching English as a second language
at the community college until 6:00.
If you can get me the paper by
then, I'll consider counting it.
Don't even think of downloading
something from the Net, Jason.
I want that essay handwritten.
A 1,000-word story in three hours?
It should be no problem, making up
stories is your God-given talent.
<i>Making up stories is
your God-given talent.</i>
<i>"Big</i>
<i>"Fat</i>
<i>"Liar."</i>
<i>"Kenny Trooper was the
world's biggest liar.</i>
<i>"They say a little lie
can grow bigger.</i>
<i>"One man will pay the price.</i>
<i>"People everywhere stopped and
stared at the big, fat liar. "</i>
Yes!
Why'd he have to steal
my board today?
Nice wheels, Shepherd!
Freak!
Sir?
I think we just hit a kid.
I'm on the phone.
Sorry about that. Apparently we
ran over a kid or something.
You all right there, buddy?
Yeah.
But you have to help get me
to the community college
in two minutes or
I fail eighth grade.
What is going on here?
I need a ride.
What am I, running a taxi service?
It's right down the road! You're lucky
I don't sue you for whiplash!
Actually, my neck
does feel pretty stiff.
Get in the car.
Watch the shoes.
Watch the shoes.
Man. If you only knew
the kind of day I've had.
Yeah, it must be really,
really tough to be 11.
I'm actually 14.
My mistake.
Jason Shepherd.
Marty Wolf.
Famous Hollywood producer.
I'm in town shooting
my new picture.
Oh, yeah, you're that guy.
Dude, no offense, but you have made
some stinkers in the last few years.
Everyone has a dry spell, Ebert.
It's Jason.
Trust me, all it takes is one
hit to get you back on top.
That's what I'm counting
on with this story.
Really? Why don't you
tell me more about that?
I tried to get out of
it, but I got busted.
What'd you say?
Dog ate your homework?
No. Dad choked on a meatball.
You spent all night
with him in the ER?
Yeah.
Teacher called the old man to confirm.
You imitated him.
Yeah, pretty much.
Listen and learn, short stack.
Here's where you went wrong.
You should've made your dad your
sister, the meatball a chicken wing.
Much easier to swallow, if you
G.M.D., which means, "Get my drift."
Wow. You're good.
No, no. I'm the best.
Here we are.
All right.
God bless you, Jared.
It's Jason.
And it always will be. Now you keep
practicing those lies, Jiminy.
Because you can take it from me:
The truth, it's overrated.
Now get out! I got a
movie to produce!
Thanks for the ride, gentlemen.
<i>Ciao.</i>
Earl! You left...
Back to the set, sir?
Yeah! Double time it, driver!
Listen, Whitaker,
I'm not your sister, I'm not your
girlfriend and I'm not your priest.
So if you want to remain my partner,
I've got two words for you.
Shut the heck up!
You talk way too much!
Can we cut? Can we...
This ain't working for me at all.
What are you doing?
Are you trying to fumigate me?
Why did you call cut? I did not
tell you to stop acting, Urkel.
Wolf, how many times have I
told you not to call me Urkel?
My name is Jaleel White, okay?
Urkel was a character
I played when I was a child!
Okay, Jaleel.
What's the problem?
You want to know the problem?
I'm getting nothing
from the chicken.
He just sits there with
his head slumped over.
I have no idea
what my motivation is.
Well, you're a police
officer named Fowl.
Mmm-hmm.
Your new partner is a crime-fighting
chicken named Whitaker.
And your motivation is a nice, fat paycheck
that keeps you from working at McDonald's!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Watch yourself, Wolf.
Watch yourself.
No, you watch yourself, pal!
You're lucky I'm not making you wear
the freaky glasses and suspenders.
I swear. I was riding Janie's
old bike and some limo hit me.
They offered me a ride. I must
have forgotten it in there.
Give us one reason
why should we believe you.
Because it's true.
There was some guy in the limo,
Marty something. Maybe he took it.
What are our options?
Without the essay, summer school.
Or summer school.
Today, students, we are going to learn
about the joys of a special friend
I like to call "Mr. Semicolon."
The semicolon was first used in a
1734 letter to
British Parliament...
Shh.
...by Mr. Jedediah Wilkinson.
W-I-L...
Help me.
Come on, Jason. You must have
made at least one friend.
Yeah. The kid behind me who kept
flicking boogers at my neck?
He seemed like a really nice guy.
I shouldn't even be in
that stupid summer school.
If it makes you feel better, my
parents are taking an adventure.
They're going river rafting
in the Grand Canyon.
But do I get an adventure?
No.
My big adventure is staying at my
Grandma Pearl's with her toe fungus.
You can hang out at my place.
My folks are taking a long weekend at
some health spa for their anniversary.
It'll just be me and Janie
from Thursday till Sunday.
<i>In a time</i>
<i>when a little lie</i>
<i>can grow bigger</i>
<i>and bigger,</i>
<i>one man will pay the price.</i>
<i>Next summer, people everywhere</i>
<i>will stop and stare.</i>
<i>Marty Wolf Pictures presents</i>
<i>Kenny Trooper,</i>
<i>the big, fat liar.</i>
You want to see it?
See it?
I think I wrote it!
Not that again, Jason.
I'm telling you!
Wait. This is it.
<i>Big Fat Liar is already being touted
as next summer's must-see movie event.</i>
<i>I recently talked to Marty Wolf,</i>
<i>the mastermind behind this
sure-to-be blockbuster.</i>
That's him.
It's the guy from the limo!
<i>Where'd you come up with this idea?</i>
<i>Some ideas you struggle
and struggle with</i>
<i>but the great ones, well,
they just come to you.</i>
Yeah, from my backpack, you loser!
Jason.
Dad,
I'm serious.
That guy stole my paper.
You have to believe me.
I can't.
I just don't trust you
right now, Jas.
Have a nice weekend.
We will.
See you on Sunday.
Have fun.
Look out for your brother, Janie.
Bye. Daddy.
Bye-bye.
We'll miss you guys.
Later. I'm going over to Rudy's.
Rudy?
Yo, what's up, dog?
How you living?
It's crackin', kid.
Peace out, little G.
Booyah!
He's not literally a
catcher eating rye bread.
It's more of a metaphor for
a state of adolescent angst.
We need to talk.
I'm tutoring.
Bet you wish you still
had your skateboard.
Let's see.
Fully-developed brain,
skateboard.
I think I'll take the brain.
But I have your skateboard.
Kaylee, pack your bags.
We're going on a trip.
I can't just go to Los Angeles.
I can't have my parents
thinking I'm a liar.
You are a liar.
In general, that's true. But this time I'm
telling the truth. I wrote that paper.
I won't rest until Wolf admits he
stole it and my parents know it.
What are we supposed to do,
walk across the country?
Three years of yard work and babysitting
money. Our flight leaves in two hours.
What about my Grandma Pearl?
I'm staying at her house.
That woman doesn't even
know what year it is.
You said you wanted an adventure.
We'll go to LA, I'll get my paper,
and we'll be back before Sunday.
My grandma will notice if I
don't even show up at all!
Kaylee, have you got a plunger?
I took a dookie and I clogged up
the toilet! Oh, boy! Oh, no!
What a mess.
This won't work.
She's not that blind and senile.
It'll work.
If any of my teammates
see me, you're dead.
We made a deal.
You want us to do your summer
school homework or not?
Yeah, it's just that...
It's only a few days.
And remember to make your
voice sound like a girl's.
Come on, big fella.
Who's there?
I've got a gun.
It's just Kaylee, Grandma.
Kaylee?
You can't be Kaylee.
You've grown so tall.
And you're so muscular.
I'm benching like 220, 230.
Good for you.
Give me a hug.
Come on.
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles
International Airport.</i>
<i>Airport shuttles are located
outside the baggage claiming area.</i>
Follow my lead.
Okay.
Hi. I'm Mr. Stroog.
Are you serious?
Is there a problem?
No.
You're kind of young to be the biggest
fur coat distributor in the Midwest.
It's a family business. I've been
selling pelts since I was a baby.
Okay.
I'm Frank.
We want to get some sightseeing in
before we cover this town in fur.
Okay.
So, this here is a little
place I like to call
Los Angeles.
Thanks for the lift, Frank.
We'll take it from here.
You got it, Mr. Stroog. Look, here's my card.
If you need a ride, give me a shout-out.
Thanks.
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>This is Ron, your driver. And
I am Arthur, your tour guide.</i>
So, what's the plan?
When we get to Wolf's building,
we jump off, infiltrate his office,
make him admit he stole my story.
That's it? That's the lamest
plan I've ever heard.
Trust me, it's going to work.
<i>So stay tuned.</i>
<i>Folks, this is the backlot, where
many of our hit movies are made.</i>
<i>Speaking of movies, in just a
few days we begin filming...</i>
Come on.
Follow me.
Excuse me, where is Stage two?
Security. Let's go.
Can I take a moment to say
how totally awesome this is?
Marty Wolf Pictures.
Please hold.
Can I help you?
We're here to see Marty Wolf.
Do you have an appointment?
I ask you,
Astrid, what kind
of sick world is this
when children need an appointment
to see their own father?
Mr. Wolf doesn't have children.
Not that he knows of.
Shh.
Look, this will be an emotional
reunion for all of us,
so once you let us in, probably gonna
want to hold Papa's calls as well.
Mr. Wolf doesn't see anyone
without an appointment.
Marty Wolf Pictures.
No, she stepped away.
I'd love to take a message.
You got it.
Well, if you'd slow down, then...
Help me out.
No.
Help me out.
No.
Help me out.
Okay.
Marty Wolf Pictures.
One moment, please.
<i>Operator.</i>
Marty Wolf Pictures, please.
Marty Wolf Pictures.
<i>Astrid Barker, please.</i>
This is Doris Del Rio down in parking.
Do you drive a Saturn, ma'am?
Yes.
Well, it's...
Um...
Parked on a dog.
I am not going to say that.
Come on.
Hello?
Your car is parked on a dog.
My car is parked on a dog?
Yes, ma'am. In the tail
area, to be more specific.
It's gruesome. Listen for yourself.
Hang on. I'm coming!
Don't die!
Just stay. Keep breathing.
Think of a happy place.
Keep a lookout. I'm sure this thing
will be over in just a few minutes.
Marty Wolf Pictures.
Can I take a message?
Mr. Wolf is about
to go into a meeting.
Uh-huh.
Sandier.
We're not just looking for my
personal organizer, Monty.
That thing is my life! If you
lost it, then you've killed me.
Draw a line of chalk around
me, baby, because I am dead!
I understand that!
No, you don't.
You always say that.
No, you don't.
Did you check your jacket pocket?
Do I look like a moron?
No, it's just if you
remember that one time...
Fine, Monty. Fine.
If it'll make you happy,
I'll check my jacket pocket.
It's in there.
Hello?
Excuse me. How's it going?
Who are you?
Jason Shepherd. Remember me?
I wrote <i>Big Fat Liar.</i>
Uh...
Monty, hold my calls.
Give me a few minutes alone
here with Mr. Shepherd.
Well, well, well.
Jason Shepherd. The young man
from Greenbury, Michigan.
I must tell you,
this is quite a surprise.
What can I do for you?
Call my dad and tell him you
stole the story from me.
Call your dad? Why?
It's the truth and you're
the only one he'll believe.
You traveled halfway
across the country
to have me tell your dad
you did your homework?
Make that phone call, and you'll
never hear from me again.
Okay.
Really?
Yes.
It's a great piece of work, kid.
And I'm not just blowing smoke.
I refer back to it whenever I
get in a bind on the script.
You'll return it to me
and make the call?
You gave me my movie, Shepherd. It's
the very least I can do for you.
You smoke cigars, hot shot?
I'm 14, Wolf.
Suit yourself.
Jason Shepherd of
Greenbury, Michigan,
it was a pleasure
doing business with you.
Oh!
No!
What have I done?
Stand back, son. Let me try and
stamp it out with this lit cigar.
I seem to be making matters worse.
Good move, Smoky!
Hold on! Help is on the way.
Stand back!
You're sick! All I wanted you to do was
to tell my dad I wrote that paper!
Or what? You'd shoot me with a spitball?
Give me a wedgie?
Grow up! This is Hollywood, baby.
It's a dog-eat-dog town.
Worse. We got cats eating cats.
We got fish munching fish.
We play by our own rules.
I'm not leaving until
you make that call!
I'll make a call, all right.
<i>Malone speaking.</i>
Rocco, this is the Wolf.
Send some of your boys
down here. I got a Code W.
Another angry writer refusing
to leave. Wolf out.
I tried to play fair, Wolf,
but you asked for it!
You don't know who
you're messing with!
Come on!
Thanks for holding. Can you
spell Soderbergh for me?
Thanks, Steven.
I'll have Mr. Wolf return.
Marty Wolf Pictures.
You don't understand!
Let go!
It was my idea!
And I wrote <i>The Nutty Professor.</i>
I've heard it all before.
Get off me!
Hi.
Hi, Astrid. Adam Sandier
called to set up a lunch.
I sent flowers to Meg Ryan because she
sounded like she had a little cold.
And I scheduled a deep body
massage for you at 3:00.
You look like you could
use a little "you" time.
Thank you, kind stranger.
What can I say? This is Hollywood,
Kaylee. It's a fish-eat-fish town.
They play by their
own rules out here!
Does that mean we're going home?
As soon as Wolf admits
he stole my story.
I'm not trying to be negative,
but didn't we just find out
Wolf isn't going to admit that?
He'll do it.
How?
Because I have his life
in the palm of my hand.
Great. So we're stealing now?
We're not stealing, we're borrowing.
I have Wolf's alarm codes, credit
card numbers, his schedule.
So?
So, this is awesome.
In a day, I'll figure out how
to use this info against him.
I don't know, Jas.
I can't go home until
my dad knows the truth.
If you saw how he looked at me.
It was like...
I don't know, like I
wasn't his kid anymore.
Do you think your plan might
include food and a place to sleep?
The guard!
Let's get out of here.
Let's check out that warehouse.
Looks like we found
our temporary home.
Look at all this stuff.
All right, Kaylee. We'll need
clothes and supplies. Let's hunker down
until the law dogs leave, then
start racking up the merch.
What are you talking about?
We stay here until closing
time, then we go shopping.
Jas?
I'm at the beach!
Frank? Mr. Stroog. Meet us
at the studio gate in 20.
Hey.
What's with the Cokes?
The machine, it's
great, they're free.
They're free.
Good morning, Frank.
Let's get moving.
We've got furs to sell.
Fur coat king of the
Midwest, my butt!
I got some R-rated dialogue
for you, but I'll keep it PG.
You owe me $100
for yesterday's ride.
You almost cost me my job.
I'm sorry.
I can explain.
Hear that?
If we could...
I don't want to hear it, okay?
I'm sorry. We came here to get
even with this guy, Marty Wolf.
He stole my story
and he's making it into...
Did you just say "Marty Wolf"?
You know him?
I used to drive him.
He fired me last year.
Why?
I'm an actor. See?
I asked him if I could audition
for one of his movies.
He could have just said no.
Instead, he takes my headshot,
writes "loser" across my forehead,
and faxes it to every
casting director in town.
You poor thing.
If you want to mess with
Wolf, I got your back.
<i>Today, it's know the enemy.</i>
Right on schedule.
<i>We begin production in two days.</i>
Dusty! El director!
First up's the big stunt.
I want to blow them away at the start!
Hit me, kiddo.
Rock and roll, baby.
I am ready to party.
We open.
Twelve different camera angles.
Smoke ascending from the
streets of the city. Kastang!
Birds descending from the heavens,
like winged messengers
from above, beckoning.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Confucius say, "Easy does it," skippy.
I can barely afford one camera,
let alone 12. And no birds.
Monty! Talk to me about the budget!
We're $2 million over, and the studio
hasn't approved the new budget.
When are they supposed to do that?
Tomorrow morning. You have a breakfast
meeting at Marcus Duncan's house.
A breakfast meeting at
Marcus Duncan's house.
Tell our little "vice president" he
can drag his sorry butt to my place
if he wants to talk
to the Wolf Man.
Actually, sir,
he's not the V.P. anymore.
He's the president.
I see.
Get his address, then.
We don't want to be late, do we?
Next!
For a big movie,
you need a big stunt.
For a big stunt, you need
serious media coverage.
I'm talking TV, print,
that Internet crap. Everything.
Who's handling that?
I am. Jocelyn Davis,
Senior V.P. of Publicity.
Sure you're not
Senior V.P. of Twinkies?
Funny.
I'll make sure the
shoot is well-covered.
Terrific! Okay, people, meeting's over.
What's next, Monty?
Cool.
12:30, stunt demonstration.
What do you think, Marty?
Perfect!
What'd you think, Dusty?
Loved it!
Actually, I think I liked it
better the first time I saw it,
in 1942, you dinosaur!
Vince, meet my new effects
whiz, Lester Golub.
A pleasure to meet...
Lester is going to design
the stunt on his iBook.
Your stunt guy will do whatever
the computer tells him.
I don't need a
computer to do my job.
Geek boy, ignore Father Time
over here and get working.
From the looks of you, I'm sure
you don't have a social life.
You two get together tomorrow
to finalize the details.
I'm off tomorrow. I'm
taking a personal day.
What was that? Personal day? What
are you talking about, Vince?
I'm taking my granddaughter
to a birthday party.
Oh...
May I?
Sure.
That's great.
Look at that.
The crazy hair. Man.
Oh, man. That's fun.
See, this is the movie business, grandpa!
The talkies, you know?
You can take your personal day in
a year or two, when you're dead!
Today we learned we're officially
dealing with the meanest man alive!
All right, colored dye.
Check.
MegaGlue.
Check.
Oh, my God.
Grandma Pearl.
Bret must be in a
living hell right now.
How many more, Kaylee?
Fifty. I gotta get ripped, baby!
Yeah. Yeah.
Feel the burn!
I'm the best, baby!
I'm the best!
You know, Grandma, you should think
about getting into shape yourself.
One more, Grandma!
One more!
It's all you! I ain't helping!
Last one! Yeah!
Hello.
Hi, Jas.
Hey, Dad.
<i>Just called to see
how you were doing.</i>
I'm doing good.
Staying out of trouble.
What's that noise?
I'm doing an experiment
for science class,
it's this thing with
ball bearings and bells.
Sounds good.
I just called because you looked
pretty upset when we left.
<i>Yeah, well, about that, Dad.</i>
I totally get what you said
about the whole trust thing.
And when you get back, you'll see I've
been trying really hard to earn it.
Glad to hear it, pal.
Good night, Dad.
Good night.
Call forwarding, got to love it.
You really think this will work?
One day.
That's all it'll take.
Wolf won't know what hit him.
Jas? A little help here.
Will your parents call?
They're in the middle of a canyon.
There's no phones.
Thanks for coming out here with me.
I came for the adventure, remember?
Right.
Let's get some sleep.
Tomorrow we launch Phase Two.
Whoa!
It's showtime, Mr. Funnybones.
You cute little monkey, you.
Look out!
Cut it out, Marty!
Hey, that kills, Marty!
Hungry!
Mr. Earpiece, meet Miss MegaGlue.
Let's dance, Funnybones!
Oh, my God!
Marty Wolf Pictures.
This is Monty.
Monty! Charisma from
Marcus Duncan's office.
<i>I'm temping for
his second assistant.</i>
I'm so psyched you're there, cookie.
I was watching Charmed last night,
<i>and just as Alyssa Milano put a
spell on her cute demon boyfriend,</i>
I had the biggest panic attack that I
forgot to give you Duncan's new address.
I didn't know he moved.
That was quick.
Yeah, in a big way. He
bought like the sickest pad
in the 90210.
We're talking mondo bucks.
Anyhoo, tell Mr. Wolf
that Duncan lives at
867 North Maple Drive.
All right.
Thanks. Got it.
What?
It's Monty. I'm glad I caught you.
Duncan moved.
Cancel the meeting. Get a makeup chick to
meet me at the office. It's an emergency.
No, you cannot cancel the meeting.
If he doesn't approve the new budget
we can't start shooting tomorrow.
I don't think you understand.
I'm blue.
Come on, now.
We all have our off days.
No, I mean I'm literally...
And I've got orange...
<i>Come on, Wolf Man.</i>
Forget it. Give me his address.
I'll figure something out.
867 North Maple.
Copy that.
You come up with
an ending for the script?
I'm working on it. I'm headed across
the lot now to do some research.
But I could use
a little help, Marty.
I'm writing and producing
a major motion picture.
I don't have time to work on
the script! That's your job.
<i>Now stop wasting time
and get to work!</i>
I'm 24 hours away from the most
important shoot of my career!
Get glasses, grandma!
Up yours, blue boy!
Yeah, I'm...
Uh-huh.
Got the alarm codes?
I'm all over it.
Sister, I invented the word "rough."
He'll be eating sugar cubes out of
my hand when I'm finished with him.
Right.
What the...
The clown!
Let's hurt him!
Excuse me...
I need backup!
Incoming!
I'm a very powerful
Hollywood producer!
What am I doing here?
Don't touch that.
Don't touch.
You kids are all gonna be
hearing from my lawyer!
Don't let him get away!
Get off of me!
You want to dance, kid?
Let's dance!
You want a piece of me?
You want a piece of me?
You're going down, clown!
You're going down.
Bring it! I'm Marty Wolf!
Do you have any idea who I am?
Come on, four eyes!
Hey!
Heads up, clown!
You're not even funny, clown!
Hello?
Where the hell did you send me?
<i>Because it sure wasn't
Duncan's house!</i>
How was I supposed to know?
Don't speak, just listen. You've got
to get me in there with Duncan!
<i>I'll just reschedule
the meeting, Marty!</i>
Jeez!
Okay, that's all you had to say.
Adiós, <i>sugarpuff.</i>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the...
Stop!
Marty, I like your new coloring.
It works for you.
You did this?
Yes. And it can end anytime.
All you have to do is make
one phone call to my dad.
It shouldn't be much of a problem, since
that headset is superglued to your ear.
Here's my dad's number.
Hiya!
Call me.
Bye-bye.
Rotten kids!
Shepherd!
Oh, my God!
I'm going to kill you!
Take it easy, man. it wasn't my fault.
The old bag rear-ended me.
Eat my bloomers, blue boy!
Very nice. That's really charming,
from a woman of your advanced years.
Have a nice day!
It's just the tire.
You'll pay for this!
All right, listen, Masher,
I'm sure we can come
to some arrangement.
Yeah, that's what
I thought, tough guy!
Who's the tough guy now, pal?
Oh, no. Come on.
No, dude.
Back off, man!
No way!
Two meetings in a row, Monty.
This is not the way to get on
the new president's good side.
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sure there must
be some explanation.
They told me to pick up
a little blue car.
They didn't say anything
about a little blue man.
You got the Wolf.
Where are you? I am at
Duncan's office right now!
I'm...
I'm not going to make it. Tell him
it's your fault and reschedule.
I'm not going to lie to the new
president of the studio, Marty.
Don't get all high
and mighty on me.
Because if I go down, you're riding shotgun,
Tootsie Roll. Now make something up.
I'll smooth things over
with him at the premiere.
Fine.
Wolf out.
<i>Hi, everybody. I'm Pat O'Brien
and welcome to Tinseltown.</i>
<i>Here we are again, this time at</i>
<i>the world premiere of Marty Wolf's
action-comedy, Whitaker and Fowl.</i>
This must be a very
exciting evening for you.
Yes. It's just good to
get the past behind me,
and finally be taken
seriously as an actor.
Can I give a shout-out?
Oh, God, it's the chicken!
<i>It looks like all of Hollywood
has turned out for this one.</i>
<i>But the question is,
where is Marty Wolf?</i>
Sweet Moses, what is that?
Don't look in his eyes.
Hey there, Marty.
Ready to end this?
Kid, you have no idea
who you are dealing with.
You think I care about
a couple of little pranks?
Nah.
See you around, Shep.
Hello.
This is J-Dog calling K-Bird.
<i>J-Dog calling K-Bird.</i>
Jas, is that you?
I'm using code names. Wolf didn't throw in
the towel. We're moving to Phase Three.
What's Phase Three?
We're going to our first
Hollywood soirée.
I don't know what you think, but all
of a sudden, it's like bam! Bad movie!
Can you say boring?
I mean, when you did <i>Saved by the Bell?</i>
Quality. Okay? Substance.
Worst film in the world.
Whoa!
There he is!
<i>El presidente!</i>
And his wife,
the very lovely Shaniqua.
It's Shandra.
Great to see you. I think they
loved it! Don't you?
I think that sad excuse for a movie
just lost the studio $30 million.
I'm pulling the plug on <i>Big Fat Liar.</i>
What?
It's over, Wolf.
Just hear me out!
The truth is...
Would you excuse us
please, Shananny?
The truth is
I missed those meetings because I had
an incredible breakthrough on <i>BFL,</i>
which I was working on all day.
I wanted to wait until we were
in front of the entire industry
to make my presentation.
One chance is all I'm giving you.
That's all I need.
Strap on your seat belt, Dr. Duncanstein,
because you are about to be blown away.
Monty!
Sorry. Marty!
What's going on? What is this big
presentation you're giving about the movie?
I have no idea!
None!
None.
I can help you.
Why do you keep showing
up in my life?
Sounds like you need to come up
with a big idea for <i>Big Fat Liar.</i>
What, some 10-year-old kid
is going to tell me how
to fix my entire movie?
First of all, I'm 14. Second
of all, I created the story.
You think I can't at least come
up with a few good twists?
No...
You mean that this kid really
did write <i>Big Fat Liar?</i>
No. He wrote a little English paper
with the same title.
Big deal.
Don't do it, Jason.
Kid, I swear to you,
you get me out of this mess,
and I'll tell your dad
you wrote <i>Big Fat Liar,</i>
<i>Erin Brockovich and
Saving Private Ryan, too.</i>
Ladies and gentlemen, friends,
if I could have your attention
for just a moment, please.
You're all probably wondering
why I'm blue and orange.
No, just go with me for a second.
You see, <i>Big Fat Liar,</i>
<i>BFL,</i> "Biffle," as it
has come to be known,
is full of action,
romance, effects,
you bet. But what it lacks
right now is a message.
Trooper's girlfriend
makes a new potion.
<i>Which is supposed to make him shrink, but
instead it causes him to change color.</i>
Why?
<i>Because now the twist is,</i>
he can't lie about
his feelings anymore.
You see, his girlfriend, Penny,
she makes Trooper an antidote,
which, instead of curing him,
causes him to change colors.
When he's bummed out,
he turns blue.
When he's depressed, he turns blue.
When he's mad, his hair turns red.
When he's angry, boom,
his curly locks turn the color
of a flaming brushfire.
<i>But when he discovers
the ultimate truth,</i>
<i>that he's in love with Penny,</i>
the softest shade of pink
finds its way across his visage.
I didn't tell him that.
What are you doing?
You're not listening to me.
<i>Just stick to the plan...</i>
I'm sorry. The emotions in this
movie are just so painful.
They're painful because
they hit home right here,
in the old corazón.
Who among us hasn't told
a little white lie?
I have.
Anybody else? You?
Guilty.
You?
It's all right, don't be ashamed.
I am right there with you.
I am right there with you.
Because our picture looks the
audience right in the eye,
and says, "Enough is enough!"
The lying has got to stop!
The truth and the truth alone
shall set ye free! Friends!
God bless all of you!
God bless America!
And God bless <i>Big Fat Liar!</i>
Very impressive, Marty.
Does this mean that you
will approve the budget?
You start shooting tomorrow.
That's great.
But if anything, and I
mean anything, goes wrong,
your movie, your deal
at the studio,
and your career is over.
You hear me?
Okay.
Shepherd, you are a genius, buddy.
Ready to make that call?
Time to let my fingers
do the walking.
Here's my dad's phone number.
Daddy.
Hello, this is Marty Wolf.
I'm standing here in my
kitchen with Jason Shepherd.
I'm looking at him as we speak.
And you better bring backup.
Weren't you on the phone
with my dad?
I was on the phone, but it
ain't with your old man.
You're a real piece of work.
Who are you?
Rocco Malone, head of
security at Wolf Pictures.
Thanks for all your help, kid.
Saving my butt twice in one year.
Who would have thunk it?
Let's go.
You, too, Punky Brewster.
You can't do this!
We have a witness!
First lesson in Hollywood, sweetheart:
Always get it in writing!
What a day.
<i>Here's the deal.</i>
The two of you are going to
get on a plane, go back home,
and forget this ever happened.
Clear?
Good. Let's go get
you two guys packed up.
I can't believe we're
just going to give up.
You're Jason Shepherd.
You can get out of anything.
Come on. You must have a
Phase Four up your sleeve.
Yeah, I guess I do.
<i>Hello?</i>
Dad, it's Jason.
I haven't...
I haven't been totally honest about what
I've been up to the last couple days.
And I think it's time
I told you the truth.
<i>The truth?</i>
Hey, Rocco.
Hey.
Why don't you head home?
I'll take the kids to the airport.
You sure?
I'll be up all night rewriting Wolf's
script anyway, so it's no problem.
All right, then. I'm getting too
old for this babysitting anyway.
Take it easy.
Good night.
Good night.
The worst part of this whole thing is, Wolf
is just going to keep getting away with it.
He treats people like dirt
and no one stands up to him!
Forget it, Kaylee.
I can't forget it!
It makes me sick
your parents will never
know you wrote that story!
What can we do? My parents will be here
in the morning! We tried everything!
It'd take an army to get
Wolf to admit the truth!
I think I know where
we can find our troops.
What are you doing here?
I've been pushed around
by Wolf for too long.
Tomorrow, his whole
career is on the line.
So are you guys up
for one last fight?
Jas?
It's payback time.
You gots to look good for
the first day of shooting.
Do you copy that, Mr. Funnybones?
That's a big 10-4, Marty.
I've brought you all here
tonight for two reasons.
A: You're all the best
in your given fields.
And B: You all despise this man.
A lot.
Gang, let's roll up our
sleeves and get to work.
Let's begin.
Assignments.
Red team, you stall him until
my parents get to the set.
That's it. One more!
That's it!
Blue team, I need your help in
the distract and delay tactics.
Gold team, you are responsible
for mental warfare.
To get what we need, we are talking
complete physical and
psycho-emotional breakdown, people!
I want to see a broken man.
I'm talking broken like, "I threw
a baseball through your window."
Snap him like a twig.
Squeeze him like a bug!
I want you to turn him into mincemeat!
And I don't even know what mincemeat is!
I want him to scream for his mommy.
"Mommy! Mommy!"
You hear me, people?
Do you read me?
I think they read you.
Fair enough.
Guys?
I just got one thing to say.
It's showtime.
It's showtime.
You from the studio?
Yes, sir.
Don't I know you?
Yeah, you do.
Frank Jackson. I was your driver
last year till you fired me.
Fabulous!
The acting career must really be
taking off. Bravo, Brando.
Get moving.
I don't want to be late.
<i>Monty, it's me.</i>
Hey, Marty. You get some
rest for the big day?
Are you kidding me? I spent half the night
with a scrub brush and a can of turpentine.
But, bye-bye, Little Boy Blue!
I am back!
Hey!
Pedal to the metal, Ricky Retardo!
I got a movie to shoot!
Sorry, sir. There seems to be
something wrong with the car.
I'll fix it.
Hot smoke.
Very hot smoke.
What the hell is happening here?
Stay right there.
No, Mr. Wolf, don't come up here.
We have a situation.
The carbide lateral valve is connected
to the defibrillator and it's acting up.
The point is,
it could blow anytime.
You might want to back up.
Back up.
What are you saying?
The engine's fried.
I need a backup car.
Are you kidding me? My movie
starts shooting in an hour!
Mr. Wolf, please, I would very much
appreciate it if you didn't yell at me, okay?
Mmm-mmm.
I want to do right.
Don't.
Don't touch, dude!
Do not touch!
Don't.
Hey!
Everything okay here?
Urkel. Jaleel.
Oh, my God. My man.
You got to get me
out of here, buddy.
Hop in.
No! Mr. Wolf, please.
Mr. Wolf, no.
Could you unlock it?
No! Mr. Wolf, please!
Drive.
<i>Sayonara,</i> loser!
F-Man to J-Dog. The
baton has been passed.
Roger that, F-Man.
Well done.
Who's a bad actor now, Mr. Wolf?
Those were real tears!
K-Bird, the baton has been passed.
Got it!
Nice car!
TV money! I didn't wear those glasses and
suspenders all those years for free!
That's a relief. Do you
know where you're going?
I'm taking a shortcut.
Put your seat back and relax, old man.
You're in Jaleel's hands now.
Okay.
You're going to fishtail!
That was close.
Yeah, baby!
Where in the hell
are you taking me?
I told you.
I know a shortcut.
Through the desert?
Slow down, you maniac!
I'm getting out!
It's your call.
I'll do it.
Do what you got to do!
I'm getting out!
Go!
Not bad.
Yo, Jaleel at the wheel.
<i>The condor has flown the coop.</i>
Roger, J-Dub. Wait.
What does that mean?
It means I'm leaving Wolf in the
middle of the desert. Urkel is out.
Hello?
Monty, it's me.
Hey, Marty.
Is everything okay?
No, no, everything is fine.
Except...
Yeah, I'm stuck in the
middle of the desert!
<i>Do you hear what
I am saying to you?</i>
The what?
<i>The desert.</i>
Get me out of here.
<i>How?</i>
I don't care how, Monty!
Just do it!
Ready to go wolf hunting?
I borrowed the chopper from
the shoot. You're in good hands.
I flew 49 combat
missions in Vietnam.
Save me the sob story, Methuselah!
I already sat through <i>Platoon!</i>
Just get me to the set.
This is Father Time.
We're headed your way.
Roger, F.T.
They're airborne.
Copy that.
Let's punch a hole in the
sky, grandpa! Go! Go! Go!
Let's get a tail wind behind
this bird, old-timer!
Go, go, go!
Brando to Base. The sheep has located
the Shepherds and we're coming home.
Yes!
Oh, boy.
What's that?
What's happening?
One of our blades is jammed! We're
going to have to do a forced evac!
What are you talking about?
We got to jump!
This bird is going down!
Vince.
Vince?
Are you kidding me?
No, but I wish I was.
You'll have to hold on tight.
We've only got one chute.
I hope it supports us both.
Wait a minute.
This is insanity!
Vince, have you done this before?
Don't worry, Wolf,
I'm a professional.
Granddad's been doing
this a long, long time.
This is Chopper One to Control.
Papa Bear and the Wolf
have left the building.
Not like this!
Sweet God, not like this!
Hello, sir.
Where's Wolf?
Late.
Bad.
Hello?
I'm on the lot, Monty!
I'll be there in a minute!
Marty.
I'm not lying. Stall Duncan
another second, okay? I'm coming.
Hey, Wolf.
How's it hanging, Shepherd?
Give me back my monkey.
Come get him.
You two, good-bye!
I'm coming, Funnybones!
Coming through!
Move it!
Look out!
Come on!
Right behind you, Shepherd!
You can't outrun the Wolf, kid!
We'll see about that.
Hang on, Funnybones!
Daddy's coming!
He's all yours, Lester.
Activate water.
Who's the geek boy now, you spaz?
This is it, Monty. If he's not here
in 60 seconds, this movie is over.
Right there is where the
big stunt is taking place.
This way.
Help.
Come and rescue me, Marty.
Feets, don't fail me now.
Let go of the monkey.
Call my dad.
Never.
Yes.
No!
That's it, kid.
It's over! You lose and I win!
I don't think so, Wolf.
You don't think so?
Come on, Jason.
You're smarter than that.
You write a story, I steal it,
and I'm about to shoot the
greatest movie of my career.
So, you admit you stole my story?
We've been over this.
It's ancient history.
Yeah, I stole your story!
Whoop-dee-doodle-doo!
You happy now?
I stole Jason Shepherd's paper
and turned it into <i>Big Fat Liar!</i>
You know who's listening, pal?
No one.
And they never will.
So, for the last time, give it up.
Because I will never, ever, ever,
like, never, ever, ever, ever,
ever infinity tell the truth.
Because the truth
is overrated, right?
- That's right!
<i>- And cut.</i>
I told you, Wolf.
The only way to shoot this scene
is from 12 different camera
angles, with birds flying around.
By the by,
Confucius say, "Kastang!
"You're busted!"
Rock and roll, baby.
It's just like you wanted, Wolf!
The press is all here!
You stole the idea for this
movie from a 13-year-old boy?
Well, he's...
He's 14.
This is the end of the line, Wolf.
It's over.
Wolf, I want to say thanks.
You taught me a valuable lesson.
The truth?
It's not overrated.
I am going to get you, Shepherd!
You did all this just to
prove you weren't lying?
I wanted to earn
your trust back, Dad.
You've earned it, buddy.
You've earned it.
We've got a movie to shoot!
Come on!
Let's make some magic.
The human hit factory
is ready to roll!
Let's go.
Where do you think you're going?
You cannot turn your backs on me!
I'm Marty Wolf!
All right, fine! Fine!
You're all fired!
You suck, Marty.
You certainly know
how to make an entrance.
What can I say?
I got big feet.
You were right, Penny. The truth?
It's not overrated.
Congratulations.
It was incredible.
It's showtime.
Hey, kids.
I'm Wolfie the Clown.
And I'm Mr. Funnybones!
Happy birthday, Darren.
Oh, my God!
Oh, no.
Yo, Little Mash,
show him your nutcracker.
