You must declare all items.
Undeclared items will be confiscated.
Tso, declare the ginseng to customs.
Why, Pop?
They make us pay 50 bucks in duty.
- Here.
- I know.
Why don't l just hide it in my pants?
They'll never know.
Brilliant, Fei Hung. Better yet,
why don't we have the master hold onto it?
They'll never search him because
he's respectable. What do you think?
Very good idea.
- You're hopeless, both of you.
- Bad idea.
I'll not hear any more of your nonsense.
I just don't understand why we have to
pay duties on everything we buy.
I don't care what you say.
Just listen to me.
Avoid trouble. Pay the duties, that's it.
I know best.
Everybody back up. Back, back!
Back. Make way.
Let the ambassador through.
What's going on?
Now watch it. lt's the ambassador
and he deserves respect.
He's treated like royalty.
He doesn't have to pay any duties.
How about that one?
He's a lucky one.
No pushing. Don't push.
Everybody back.
Let these people through!
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?
Let's go.
Okay, okay? Okay?
Shut up. Someone push him.
Please, sir, l apologize.
Listen, Fei Hung.
- Why did you give him our ginseng?
- So we don't have to pay tax.
Once we get on the train,
I'll look for the box.
- What a terrific idea.
- What's that?
You could throw me down again
and l'll hide some more.
Here l go. Here l go.
He must've tripped.
Look at you. You're so clumsy.
- Come on, get up.
- File in!
Wow, what a crowd.
Why don't you go get a seat
- and l'll pay the taxes.
- All right, son.
I'll see you on board.
If you have nothing to declare,
begin boarding right now.
Here, Fei Hung, take this.
Got it.
Come on.
Fei Hung, great.
Easy, easy.
Be careful. You'll crush everything.
That's good.
Hold it.
Hey, where are you going? Stop!
Come back! Fei Hung!
Fei Hung, let him go!
Fei Hung, forget about him!
Come back here. Come back.
Fei Hung,
now, let me remind you.
A hero lives but a few seconds.
A master holds onto his life.
But he stole your wallet.
And l took it back.
That's not the issue.
The point is, the stronger man knows--
It's more important to forgive
than it is to fight.
- That's right.
- What was I thinking?
Your turn.
How about this?
Hey, you know better than that.
- But there's no other move.
- To there.
Try it again.
Hey, look at the white crane.
Have you ever seen one like that?
It's still your play.
Come on.
Can we start over?
- You still have a chance.
- Where? l don't see it.
It's not fair. You always win.
Ready?
Oh, God!
Damn it!
Are you okay?
Oh, l bet that hurt.
I'm sorry, sir.
- Is this yours?
- I'm afraid so.
Be more careful.
Yes, sir.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Fei Hung, what's this?
We call it cheating.
You've only got 10 minutes,
so hurry up.
Oh, the ginseng! Time to find it.
Oh, yeah. Good idea.
Father, forget about this.
Let me find something
you're really going to like.
I don't think l'm ready to eat,
- but I thank you.
- Come on.
How about a nice roasted chicken?
We can find him one.
- How about it, huh?
- Yeah.
I can see you two
want to look around a bit.
It's okay. I'll be fine here.
- Go on.
- Come on.
Hey!
You two stay out of trouble,
you hear me?
You make sure you come right back.
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Sorry, sorry.
God, do you believe
the smell of this place?
I think I'm gonna be sick.
God.
Hey, this way.
The vegetation's much nicer.
Yes, l see.
It's making me hungry.
Maybe we could grab a roll.
Hey!
What are you doing here?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
- You think you have reservations?
- Yeah, yeah, we do.
- Go on back.
- Check inside.
I've had enough. Go on.
One more time,
and you're off the train.
- So, what do we do now?
- I got an idea.
- Okay, now what?
- Just watch me.
Go!
Get out of here! Go away! Go away!
- Look out!
- They've gone wild!
Look out!
Here. Hold this.
Stop him!
Fire! Fire!
Sorry, sir.
Wait--
Hey!
He--
I'm sure l saw him come this way.
Hey, stop!
- Hey, you! Come back!
- Where you going?
Hey, you.
Wait. Why you hit--?
I kill you!
There. Traitor.
A what?
Hot tea, sir?
Hot tea for sale.
Thank you.
You leave me alone!
Next time, I cut your throat.
Traitor.
You--!
Hey, listen!
I'm not a traitor, you hear me? You--
- Then what are we fighting about?
- Don't play games. You hit me.
Where'd he go?
Hey!
Back again? Why don't you give up?
Oh, no, old man. Apologize.
What did you say?
How dare you call me a traitor.
Okay. Sorry.
Fine, but l still owe you one.
Here.
Hey, show respect.
- Stand still.
- Respect to you?
You must be kidding me.
Let's make this fair.
Ready?
Drunken boxing.
That's right. l'm the master.
You think so?
Again.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
You come.
You know,
a kid like you isn't worth my time.
I show you!
Tiger slash at bear!
Quail!
What do you call that one?
It's called
"Turtle holding wine barrel."
Catch the bouquet!
Eagle grabs the rabbit!
Down the hatch!
Drunk plays the flute?
And this one?
Nursing a hangover.
Okay.
Stand up.
Your kung fu is pretty good.
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,
but that drunken boxing was--
Impressed?
Basically, it's slow,
and you have no power.
It's pathetic.
What?
I can defeat any kung fu.
I show you power.
That's nice, but you're out of time.
Time? l'm young and strong.
I've got lots of time.
But your train's leaving over there.
Nice try, old man,
but now you're going to get it.
- All right, kid.
- Come back here!
Oh, no, the train!
Wait for me!
Come on, give me your hand.
Hey, thanks a lot.
Get what you were after?
Good bye, young dragon.
Good fortune to you!
The ginseng.
Ginseng?
All right, everyone here get up.
Gather your luggage for inspection.
Everyone, now. Come on.
You. Wake up.
Good morning.
- What are you doing?
- Something has been stolen,
and we're going to find it.
Guard!
- Search them.
- All right, what is all that?
You, take it out.
- Hurry up.
- Tso, open this. Fei Hung.
Let me see.
- Bear gall.
- What else? Come on.
Green toad.
- Next.
- Deer horn, ginseng--
What's that? The one you dropped.
- Open that.
- This one?
What's that?
- Fried yak.
- Okay, next.
- Shit.
- Now the other box. Come on.
- Let me see the other box.
- Bear gall.
Not that. That.
Let me see that one.
Not that one. The one over there.
- Which one?
- On the seat, between you.
This? No, no, no. That one?
He means the ginseng.
He wasn't hiding it.
Well, then open it up.
What are you waiting for?
- Open that box! Right now!
- Excuse me, sir.
These gentlemen are clearly
physicians from Hunan.
Why don't you give them a break, huh?
I don't give breaks. I give orders.
Show me your papers.
- Come on, let's see them.
- Here.
Sir, my apologies.
Sir.
He's with Counterintelligence.
He's with the central government.
Better not challenge his authority.
All right, next car.
- Search up there.
- Next car.
I'm amazed they would think
we would steal anything.
It is such an insult.
Yeah.
Put that away.
Do you all realize
what this means?
They certainly won't buy the
rest of the shipment without it.
You know, I'm truly astounded
at the incompetence of all of you.
You severely damaged my reputation
with the British Museum of Art.
They've asked me to deliver
the jade seal of the emperor,
and l have every intention
of fulfilling that request.
I don't care how you do it.
I want it back.
Yes, sir.
We think we know
who the thief is, sir.
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.
John,
we're having a bit of trouble with
the workers at the steel factory.
I trust you'll deal with it.
Of course, sir.
I know just what to do in this situation.
I promise you'll have no more trouble.
- Let's make sure.
- Yes, sir.
Ancestors be blessed.
It's grand slam!
Let's go, let's go.
Come on, come on, pay up.
Quickly. We haven't got all day.
Go and see who is at the door.
Come on.
Money. That's the way.
More. Now your turn. Come on.
She wins every time.
Madam?
The master is back.
Yeah, yeah, the master.
Oh, God, it's my husband!
- Hi.
- Hello.
What took you so long?
I was in the kitchen.
Stand back.
Here.
Miss me?
What are you all doing?
Oh, it's you.
I'm so glad you're home.
How was your trip?
Is everything all right?
More mahjongg?
Quiet!
How many times have l asked you
not to see patients while I'm away?
You know it's illegal.
Oh, now, l know l'm not supposed to,
and l tried to wait, but I had no idea
when you would return. Besides, if you were me,
I know you would've done the same thing.
Wow, l bet you won a lot.
Not now.
Perhaps I should examine them.
Oh, it's a female problem.
I can handle it.
Fei Hung, would you prepare
my altar for me?
- All right.
- You should wash your hands.
Stop it.
We'll need the altar ladder
over here, please.
- Did you remember to water the plants?
- Oh, yes.
Excellent.
Thank you.
Hey, Mom, whose money?
Son.
- What was that?
- I didn't hear anything.
- The altar.
- Yeah.
Oh, thanks for coming.
My share. Give me.
Go. Go.
Hey.
Show a little respect.
Now, remember your treatment
next Friday, ladies.
Bring money.
Hello, Mrs. Wong.
How are you?
Has Master Wong returned?
Yes. He's inside.
Any news about my ginseng?
- Did he get it?
- Let's ask him. Come in.
- Oh, thank you.
- Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng.
Mr. Chan, l'm--
- Why are you here so soon?
- Fei Hung.
- The ginseng's in the back.
- I know.
- Let me get it.
- Go on.
It's beautiful.
I brought you a whole root.
Wait till you see it. lt's just in back.
Some tea?
- You are so kind.
- Yes.
- Please have a seat. l'll be right back.
- Thank you.
- I'm getting out.
- Where are you going?
- You got to help me out.
- When the master finds out, he'll kill me.
- He will not.
- Fei Hung.
- What are you doing?
- Stepma, come here.
I don't know what to do.
We're in such trouble.
I lost the ginseng on the train.
What? What did you do now?
Wha--?
Okay, okay, okay.
Please. You got to help us out.
Fei Hung!
- Yes!
- What's taking so long?
You just go out and serve him tea.
I'll think of something.
I'll leave it up to you two. Coming!
Oh, madam,
what should we do about this?
You see that door behind me?
- You mean--?
- In the cabinet.
- Sure.
- There's a black box.
- Oh, yeah?
- Look inside it.
Another ginseng.
I can't believe it!
Strychnine.
- What for?
- For you.
Oh, no, madam,
please don't tease me this way!
Who's teasing?
I have your tea, Mr. Chan.
Thank you very much, son.
Enjoy it.
Go, go.
Father, you must be very hot.
- Let me help you.
- Mr. Chan.
It's real.
Now, Mr. Chan,
I know you have never seen
a specimen as beautiful as this,
have you?
Oh, and let me tell you, wait till you see
what happens to you when you take it.
Women won't believe the difference
in your performance,
and you will owe it all
to the master--
What are you doing
with that rutabaga?
Rutabaga?
This is a rutabaga?
You mean it isn't ginseng?
- No.
- Silly of me.
Of course it isn't ginseng.
What l meant to tell you
was that you should
stay away from rutabagas,
especially big rutabagas like this one,
while you're taking ginseng.
It causes gas and neutralizes the
effect or something like that.
Excuse me.
Mr. Chan,
I'm glad she remembered
to tell you about that.
You know, most people don't realize
that when you use ginseng
you should avoid the use of rutabaga,
because they're not a good mix.
- Rutabaga, shmutabaga.
- What's wrong with you?
Stop that, Fei Hung!
Hi. Back so soon?
Now what?
- Good luck, now.
- You think this looks like ginseng?
Oh, yeah, it looks just like it.
Where did you find it?
Father's bonsai tree.
What a great idea.
Just blame it on Tso.
Okay.
I'll try to keep
your father distracted.
What do you think of this?
Boy, that looks great.
Great. I'm a genius.
Excuse me. May l have a word?
Just a second.
Of course. I can wait.
What is it, dear?
- Come.
- What?
Come on. Just one minute.
- Can't this wait? l'm busy.
- Come here.
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait
any longer to tell you.
Fei Hung is all grown up now.
Someday, he will leave our house.
- What?
- Oh, you know.
How cute he was when he was little.
But why is it wet?
Let me tell you. l'm glad you asked.
Because it was just picked this morning.
You're really going to enjoy the potency
of this one. It's really powerful.
You just need a little bit.
A little brother around here
could take his place.
We can talk about this later.
Don't be rude.
Please, or l will never forgive you.
You shouldn't talk that way to me.
Well, you never let me talk.
- Honey, not now. Mr. Chan--
- Don't you turn your back on me.
Okay. Roll it up tight
to keep it nice and fresh
and keep it close to your heart. Like that.
Remember what I told you
and have a nice day.
Yes. l do think we need
to talk about this now.
- Master Wong?
- Yes?
- Thanks for the ginseng.
- Everything is all right?
- Just fine. l'll keep it inside.
- He liked it.
- Let me see you out.
- Let Fei Hung do it.
- Mrs. Wong, bye-bye.
- I can show you. Please, this way.
- Bye-bye, now.
- Goodbye, Mr. Chan.
Anyway, as l was saying
before Mr. Chan interrupted us,
- it's time you thought about this.
- I don't know what you're trying to tell me.
- Mother, Mr. Chan's gone.
- Yes?
- Oh, thank God.
- What's this all about?
Look, if you don't want to talk about this
right now, l understand.
You've had a long trip.
You should get some rest.
Come on. Let's sit down.
Yes, Father. Please take a rest.
It's a good idea.
I better start taking
better care of myself.
I need to realize I'm not
getting any younger.
Well? Why do you make that look?
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.
- That's not all.
- What?
What happens when Mr. Chan drinks
the tea made from those roots?
So he will get a little dizzy.
He's going to have the time of his life.
I wish I could say the same.
All right, all right.
That's it for me.
See you tomorrow.
Hey, thanks for bringing it down.
Fo Sang, she's cooling down.
- Can you give me some more fire?
- Just give me one minute.
Stand back.
That was great. Thanks for the light.
Almost quitting time.
After this, l ought to.
See you tomorrow.
Hey!
Get them back to work.
- But why?
- Go!
I'm the new foreman here.
Now ring the bell.
Go on.
Hey, Fo Sang,
what the hell you doing now?
- Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?
- Yeah!
Sorry.
I was just told that we
have a new foreman here.
New foreman?
Well,
we seem to have fallen
behind this month,
so everybody works the
night shift for one month.
What? Extra shifts?
Hey, guys, hold on.
So, let's say we work all
those overtime hours for you,
then we need overtime pay.
- Quiet.
- You give us no choice.
You either work the overtime, or we close the
steel mill down, and you'll all be without jobs.
Now, you can take it or leave it.
Mr. Smith,
you can't blackmail us anymore.
We worked hard for you,
and now we've had enough!
We quit!
Hold it!
Nobody is to leave.
You'll stay and work.
Do you understand that?
You can take my job,
but you can't run my life!
You think you can make us?
Who you think you are? Let's go!
- Don't move!
- You're in our way!
All of you, right now!
Get back to work!
That's enough!
Free him!
Get him!
Everyone up! Back to work!
Great!
You see? He's very persuasive.
They're going to get right back to work.
No, again.
Black tiger steals heart!
Okay, now! Clean!
It's bloody impossible
to sleep with all this noise.
Why don't we just buy it
and have it bulldozed?
You know that we've been
through this before.
- Mr. Wong refuses to sell.
- It's ruining my life,
so why don't you go and
do something about it?
Yes, sir.
Okay, l'll catch you later!
Hey, Fun, you're working too hard.
You need husband to run
that snake stand, huh?
Perfect job for me, eh?
A husband, huh?
Yeah. l bet you'd be running away
from these snakes all day.
Come on, now.
Why would l want to pay some lazy
man when l can do it better, huh?
You know, you make good point.
But seriously now, Fun,
you know, you don't have man around,
so l worry about your safety.
Hey, Fun, I've been thinking,
- let me teach you kung fu.
- How about drunken boxing?
Where did you get that idea?
No one does that.
If you really want to fight, l teach you
the Choi Lee Fut boxing style.
Oh, wise man speak.
What you looking at?
- Get back to work.
- Right-- Right away.
How much you want?
We've got customers waiting.
They need the help now.
- Yellowtail!
- Yellowtail? Okay.
Drunken boxing.
What does she know anyway?
Hey, Tsang Sang.
- What, Fei Hung?
- A fillet of salmon
and a pound of fish maw, okay?
Hey, where are you going?
Really soft skin,
but the meat is tougher.
Hey, Fun, I'm going to
need a few things, okay?
Fei Hung! Hi.
Oh, it's getting away.
- What can l get you?
- One pheasant and two orders of gall.
- That would've been my choice.
- I've been waiting a long time!
- Here.
- Thank you.
You want this or not?
I got a customer waiting.
- Oh, yeah. l'll be right there.
- Fei Hung.
I hear drunken boxing is the best.
Would you be able to teach me?
- How about it?
- Of course. Anytime.
Hey!
How about l bone it for you, eh?
Oh, no. That's all right.
How about later with that?
We're discussing drunken boxing.
Fei Hung, when do you think
you could teach me?
Anytime would be fine.
You just let me know.
Fun, you need real instructor
to learn how to fight.
Maybe Tsang Sang
can give you a lesson.
He doesn't teach the style l like.
Drunken master just for show.
You cannot win a fight with that.
Forget him. He's jealous.
I like your style.
Fei Hung, time to admit it.
Your drunken boxing is no
match for Choi Lei Fut.
Isn't that right? You agree?
Yeah! Right! That's right.
- Depends on who's fighting.
- What do you say to a challenge, then?
Out of my way.
My Choi Lei Fut,
your drunken boxing.
And if l lose, you can have your fish
and anything else you
want no charge, on me.
Listen, you can learn from Fei Hung.
I don't need your help.
I appreciate the offer,
but there's too many people here,
and somebody could get hurt.
No way, Fei Hung.
You're going to fight this time.
Attention, everybody!
Listen!
I'm Tsang Sang,
and this is Wong Fei Hung.
It's your lucky day.
I have challenged him to a fight.
Come on.
I'll hold this. Remember,
it's an exhibition match,
so go on.
Drunken boxing.
Okay, okay, that's enough.
All right, that's enough.
The winner is Fei Hung.
No. Really, it was a draw.
I think Tsang Sang would agree.
It's not over yet!
Yeah, l'm coming!
It's my stepmother.
- I gotta go. Thank you, Fun.
- Come on!
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey, Fei Hung!
- Fish.
- Why, thank you.
- What do I owe you for this?
- You can have it.
Oh, thanks a lot.
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?
Okay, okay, show's over.
Don't tell me you were
fighting for food again.
- Me? No way.
- You know your father will kill you
if he hears about it.
How can l replace the ginseng?
- Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.
- But why?
We'll be in big trouble if Mr. Chan
decides to brew that tree root.
- You would do that?
- Just remember, you owe me one.
Yeah.
Hey, that's the guy we're looking for.
Stay close to him while l go
and get the boss, okay?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay, here's the money.
I'm sure they're high quality.
She got them from her husband.
- Look, I'm late already. Let's go, okay?
- I'll see you later.
So was the drought very serious?
In that province, rice and grain were
 scarce before there was a drought.
With no rainfall,
there will be no harvest,
and that is serious.
- We must act now.
- It's so bad.
They so poor that some families
have to share a single pair of pants.
Who gets to wear them?
If you have job,
you wear the pants.
- Oh, wow.
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- It's all right. How are you?
- Good to see you.
Fei Hung, don't you think
we should be going?
Aren't you meeting
my wife for tea?
Oh, no, not mahjongg again.
How can you say that?
It's our fund-raising meeting,
and you were supposed
to remind me.
Oh, l almost forgot.
We'd better be going.
You don't want to keep them waiting.
You should go.
- Of course. You're right.
- Bye.
- Goodbye. Good day.
- Nice talking to you.
No mahjongg!
- Oh, no problem.
- Yes, sir!
- Come on.
- Let's get out of here.
Go tell John.
It's been called to our attention
that Master Wong needs us
to lend him some money.
Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me.
I'm sure l speak for everyone.
We'll just take up a collection.
Did you hear what l said?
I don't personally need any of your money.
- It's for the drought victims.
- But your wife--
Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.
This could happen to you.
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...
- Nothing right now.
- You sure?
You better not have said anything,
you understand?
- I won't say a word.
- I won't tell a soul.
- Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.
- Like you don't?
How dare you say that?
I only told my sister--
Chiu doesn't even know I came here.
Ladies, somebody
has been talking.
They always lie to me.
Look at their faces.
Now, that's enough.
Can't we just take a look?
- Let's see.
- There.
Hey, careful!
Oh, so beautiful.
Oh, don't handle it like that.
And l'm only borrowing the money.
You're going to have to give it back to me.
I know, I know. I understand.
Come on. Show it to us.
- Here.
- So did you get it?
No. I haven't actually seen it,
but I'm sure they have it.
Well, we can't waste any more time.
Grab the seal,
and we'll meet you out front.
Okay, grab it, and I'll see you outside.
Oh, you're so lucky.
You're lucky.
It's gonna be so beautiful on you.
Hey, wait!
Where's--?
The necklace is gone.
You've got to learn to speak up.
Stop him!
Stop! Come on, girls!
Let's go!
Leave it.
Fei Hung! It's over there!
He went that way! Go!
Excuse me! Excuse me!
You better run.
Fei Hung, you're my hero!
Oh, you are a hero.
- Hey, Fei Hung.
- You see that?
Attaway.
- What's this?
- You bumped me.
Oh, l'm sorry about that.
No. That's not good enough.
- Did l miss something?
- Get on your knees and bow. Right now.
What?
You must be out of your mind.
Leave him alone.
You were in on it.
l saw the whole thing.
You mind your own business, bitch.
Hey, who you calling bitch?
I can't let him get away with that.
And who the hell do you think you are
strutting around here like a peacock
in that bad English suit of yours?
- I think l should kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?
- Ugh!
- Wait--!
- Mom, are you all right?
- Go away.
I want this guy's ass!
Hey, hey, take it easy. You'll be okay.
Oh, she wants to fight?
We'll take the two of you.
What? You're going to start this again?
- What'd you say?
- I said, kick his ass!
- You want me to go kick--
- You will, or I will.
All right.
Oh, what happened? Are you--?
I'm all right.
He's a very good fighter.
The necklace is inside.
It's going to be ruined!
The necklace?
Fei Hung! Throw it over here, Fei Hung!
Here!
- Where'd he learn to do that?
- Oh, look at that!
- Very good skills.
- Po Chi Lam.
- He does drunken boxing, doesn't he?
- Yeah.
Oh, well, then, maybe he'll give us
an exhibition on drunken boxing.
Oh, will he? Ask him!
All right.
Whatever you want.
Fei Hung! Come here!
- All right.
- Yeah?
Time for drunken boxing.
- What about Father?
- I'll take care of him.
Besides, it will be great publicity
for the school.
- Your dad will be happy.
- Okay.
Drunken boxing!
All right, what are you scared of?
Four of you guys can't beat one?
Get him!
- What is that, huh?
- It's drunken boxing.
Come on, now.
- What do you think?
- Can he do more?
- Of course he can.
- Yeah.
Hey, you're a bunch of fools.
- Come on.
- Oh. Let's go. Wait for us.
- Take as much as you can carry.
- Okay.
Hey, who's going to pay for that?
- Master Wong's charge account.
- All right, then.
- Hey, where'd they go?
- Over there, l think.
- Let's go.
- Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!
- What are they doing?
- What's that?
- Don't know.
- You see?
Oh! l'm going to call the police.
- Come with me.
- Don't do that.
- Fei Hung, I brought you some help.
- Oh!
But Father will kill me.
You can blame it all on me.
You're going to lose if you don't,
so just go ahead.
Yeah.
Here you go, another bottle.
Two at once?
Ling, do you think that's a good idea?
Don't worry. lt gives him power.
Are you all right?
One more drink would be helpful.
Here is the very last bottle.
You, get up!
What the hell was that?
What does it mean when
there's a picture of a skull?
Oh. Good stuff.
The last one really hit the spot.
Monkey drinks master's wine.
That was the crazy corkscrew
open wine bottle.
White tiger washes face.
Pop the bottle!
- What's wrong? You have a hangover?
- Kill him!
Do you like drunken monkey?
Eagle carries wine bottle.
Got you now!
Attack! Waterfall!
That one there, l showed him.
Here is Peter Piper
playing the flute.
Oh, that's a good one.
Down the hatch!
Wheelbarrow.
Drunken maid flirting
with the master.
Snake Eyes.
- And this one?
- Gypsy Wine.
- It's called Gypsy what?
- Just watch.
Uncle stirs the barrel.
- Come back!
- Fei Hung!
- He can't even stand up straight!
- Find some more wine.
Of course.
Doctor Wong!
What's going on here?
Those men are attacking Fei Hung!
Hold this. Fei Hung!
- Fei Hung!
- Smash bottle against the wall!
Oh, no!
Fei Hung!
Have you been drinking?
You stop it right now!
Down the hatch!
- What are you doing?
- Father?
You have the cutest little nose.
Look how well they get along.
- How are you, Dad?
- Fighting again!
Fighting? Okay.
You should have been here. Fei Hung
defeated all 5 of those gangsters.
- What was this all about?
- They tried to steal the diamond necklace
- that Ling sold to me.
- What?
What? You sold your diamond necklace?
Why didn't you tell us
Po Chi Lam needed more money?
We would have helped you.
You know we're all friends here.
No. The school doesn't need money.
Here, you can take charge
of the funds we raised.
Stop that! Fei Hung!
- Fei Hung!
- Hello, Madam Wong.
- Hi.
- I said stop it!
No, please, Master Wong,
don't hurt him!
- He's drunk!
- Mom, fetch me another bottle.
Go home now!
- Now!
- Yes, dear.
- Do as he says. All right.
- Let's go.
See you.
Go home now, Daddy
Go on. Follow him!
Losers.
You didn't do any better.
And what were you trying to do?
You've ruined the school's reputation!
They think we're broke!
And you, you idiot,
what have I told you
about drunken boxing
and fighting in the streets?
Now, tell me,
is everything here so bad
- you have to sell your diamonds?
- Come on.
Do you really think I would have
sold something that's precious to us?
- I would never!
- Don't lie to me!
How much money did you
lose playing mahjongg?
Well, how much?
I always win at mahjongg.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Besides, who are you going to believe,
me or friends?
Stepma, I believe you.
- You have anymore of that wine?
- Shut up!
Did you hear what l told you? Shut up!
You disobeyed me!
I said absolutely no fighting
and no drinking.
And above all, no drunken boxing!
You even fought with me,
your own father!
You disgraced your family name!
Wait! Wait! Hold on!
Would you stop hitting him?
He was just defending me!
They tried to break my jaw.
I guess that's something
you don't care about.
Damn you, woman!
lt was forbidden!
They could have killed him.
Don't you care about that?
Oh, sure. Like it matters.
You're beating him worse
than those guys ever did.
You're driving me insane!
I can't believe this!
What's this?
- Oh, my God!
- What's this?
What has happened
to my 300-year-old bonsai?
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!
Tso!
You better tell me
what happened?
Just hold on!
You shouldn't blame
everything on him,
because l was actually
the one who did it.
I was practicing my kung fu
and then l tripped over
that statue right over there.
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.
God only knows,
I could have gotten killed,
but I see now you don't care. Oh, well.
You know that's not it, Ling.
I am so sick and tired of your deception!
If you're going to hit me, just go on.
You know, that's not a bad idea.
It's time you showed me respect.
That's not gonna work this time!
You better hit me so l won't
cause you any more trouble.
You're driving me out of my mind!
Hit me then! Hit me, all right?
Or better yet, kill me!
- Kill me and the little one inside me!
- Little one?
Is that so?
We're going to have a baby?
Why didn't you tell me?
- Come inside.
- Never!
You told me to get on my knees.
Here l am, on my knees! l do this for you.
- Please stop.
- It doesn't matter if I'm pregnant!
- Mom has a little baby!
- I don't care what it does to the baby.
- I apologize. I wouldn't hit you.
- Leave me alone. You said enough!
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!
- Then put me down!
- Okay.
Leave me alone, I said!
- No! You have to stop this!
- All right, all right, I will.
Okay. Are you all right?
- There's no way I'll forgive you!
- What are you doing? No!
This is all my fault.
Please, you ought to be careful.
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!
- What are you waiting for?
- Yes, master.
I'm begging you, Ling.
Sit over there, you'll be all right.
Ling!
Oh! Sorry.
- Ling, l'm so sorry.
- How dare you?
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.
- Let me help you.
- You did it on purpose.
Now, of course I didn't.
Oh, don't lie. Haven't you done enough?
- Is the baby all right?
- Stop it!
- It's fine.
- Good.
- Are you comfortable?
- Master Wong, Mrs. Chan is here.
She says she has a bit of a problem.
- You stay right here. l'll be right back.
- Mrs. Chan?
Congratulations, Father.
I'm really proud of you.
Thank you.
Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.
Dr. Wong, this really isn't ginseng.
I showed it to another doctor
and he says it's poisonous.
Now, l'm not sure where you got it,
but you've surely been misled.
It has made my husband deathly ill.
Thank God he only brewed half of it.
You owe me, and you're going to have
to take the blame for this mess. Now!
Forgive me. Uncle Ho,
get the snake extract.
I can assure you he will recover
if you give him this.
Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful.
- I promise l won't tell anyone.
- Thank you.
- It must have been a mistake.
- You're kind.
Good day, madam.
Get over here, Tso!
- What's this?
- He did it! Fei Hung!
How could you do such a thing?
Are you out of your mind?
You are destroying my reputation!
Here you go, Father.
You dropped your bonsai tree.
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!
Ruin me! Drunk!
- Wait, Wong, don't!
- Hurt my friends!
That's it!
Just listen! It was stolen off the train
and he couldn't get it back!
Oh, shit. What am l saying?
See, he was trying
to save you some tax.
How would he have known
the ginseng would be stolen?
The ginseng was stolen?
Even so, he still lied to me!
No! Not acceptable!
You shouldn't defend him! He's a thief
and a drunk. Just stay out of it!
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, yeah?
You like some wine?
Just stay right there.
I'll give you some wine.
Come on, open up.
Come on, drink!
Stop it, Wong! Stop!
No more! What are you doing?
You're going to fight me now?
I disown you!
Now, get out!
You better do as l say!
Get out!
Come on! Get out of here!
Stop it! That's enough!
You're going to kill him!
That's enough, Wong!
Fei Hung! Fei Hung!
Please, don't! Please!
You're killing him, Wong, can't you see?
I don't care! I want him out!
Father!
Up! Get out of here!
That was self-defense!
He didn't mean to do it!
Out!
Now!
Fei Hung!
After him, Tso!
Don't let him go!
Tso!
That way.
Oh, yes.
- How many you want?
- Excuse me, sir.
Could you tell me where
I could l find the herbal shop?
- Right down on left.
- Thank you. Here you go.
Hello. Beer, please.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
I've never seen you drink so much.
You know your father's going to be
very angry with you, Fei Hung.
Let's not talk about this.
Bring me another drink.
- Keep it coming.
- No way. That's it for tonight.
Excuse me, miss?
I want a song here.
Something l should sing?
"The Ocean's Crying," but I sing it.
You play for me now?
Okay.
I am so sad now
I was so happy and now
I'm all alone with no home
What can l do?
lf not for the wine
I'd be hurting all the time
If only l could go home
Father, listen to me now
What can l do to make it up
To make you proud
Make you proud
I only tried to help
But I saw your bonsai tree
I thought l'm so smart
Why did you--
There he is, right over there.
He doesn't look so bad.
Oh, yes, he is.
He's real tough. A fighter.
Well, let's just see about this.
I still love you
No matter what you--
Party's over. l suggest you go.
No matter what you do
What? You stop that!
Love you
You shut up! Listen to me!
- The rest of you, go on home!
- Come on.
Go on! Get out of here!
Yeah. You gotta leave. Go on. Move!
Let's get out of the way.
What happened to the music?
Are you the drunken boxer?
Sure. l'm pretty drunk,
but I don't know about boxing.
He's just faking.
Come on. What's the matter with you?
Get up and fight me!
Fei Hung?
- Out of my way! What are you doing?
- Hey.
It's none of your goddamn business.
Get him out!
What's going on?
Is this some kind of joke or what?
No, no! You should have seen him!
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.
Why you kick me?
Look at you.
Get up and fight me! Come on!
Get this drunk out of my sight!
Go! Go on! Kill him!
Wait. Not yet.
Don't kill him, teach him a lesson.
Is that Fei Hung?
Yeah, he's hurt bad.
- Come.
- That's bad. Let's go.
Fei Hung!
- Up there!
- Wang!
Fei Hung, don't be ashamed.
When we were kids,
we used to go naked all the time.
I should have found you sooner.
You'll be okay. Just give it some time.
By the way,
I have some good news, too.
Just listen to me. Guess what.
Every woman in town
wants to be your wife.
It's the truth.
Hey, all right. Come on.
Dry your eyes.
Father--
I know.
I have a good reason to
forbid drunken boxing.
Those who practice it,
frequently wind up as alcoholics.
Not if one uses restraint
and self-discipline.
But that's more difficult
than you might think.
It's true that alcohol can make the body
loose and its pain threshold higher,
but it's difficult to
drink the proper amount.
Many drunken boxers become
nothing more than drunken fools.
The odds of bringing shame
and disgrace upon oneself
and one's family is just too great.
It also reminds me
there is an ancient proverb
that equates the drinking
of alcohol with water.
"Boats can float on water,"
or so it says,
"but they can sink in it, too."
Now, that's a profound lesson.
- I have only one question.
- What?
Whose boat are we talking about?
I will never drink again.
There, there, Fei Hung.
I'm glad to see that you're okay now.
Come on, let's get up and thank all
your friends here for helping you. Go on.
You should--
- How's the baby today?
- Oh, he's just fine. Let him be.
Oh. All right.
Sorry, we are closed now.
- Where's Fei Hung?
- Excuse me?
- Is he here?
- He might be. What for?
It's private.
Okay. Well, in that case.
What was that for?
Keep your distance.
- That's enough. l want you to leave.
- I'm warning you.
You know, you're not bad.
- It's you!
- You!
Fei Hung, hold him for me!
Help.
Father, help!
- That's enough!
- Help him!
Fei Hung, are you all right?
- Yeah, I was just pretending.
- Fei Hung, who is that?
- Hey!
- Fei Hung, hold it!
- Hey!
- We have you surrounded!
- Watch him!
- Fei Hung, I'm talking to you.
Yeah. Would you stop?
- Me?
- Please, sir,
I hope you can forgive us.
I am Wong Kee Ying. I apologize.
You are very famous.
Meeting you is an honor.
I am Fu Wen Chi.
Fu Wen Chi?
- Our most decorated Manchu officer.
- Father knows him?
- Is it true?
- Yes, it is.
It's an honor. Welcome.
- Thank you.
- Right this way.
- Good evening.
- I can only say this is unexpected...
I guess that man is someone important.
Trust me, if he was important,
he wouldn't be hitting women,
would he?
Think about it.
- What?
- Keep searching. We have to find it.
- Look in the parlor when you're done.
- Yes, ma'am.
You have no idea where you left it?
No, I don't.
Where could it be?
Tso might know.
- Hey!
- Something's wrong?
Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it.
She's quite a handful.
Oh, think I'll get some ice.
- Where did you put it?
- What?
What is that?
Ground garlic.
I mean there in your hand.
- We found it!
- Fei Hung, where are you going?
I'm not finished with that.
When you surprised me
in the baggage car,
I was trying to get back the jade seal
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.
I wound up with your ginseng instead.
Tell me something,
there must be a hundred
jade seals in our museum.
- Is this one so special?
- Fei Hung, they all are special.
Think about this.
Today they plunder a seal.
It seems small.
Tomorrow they take another,
and the next thing you know,
the Great Wall is gone.
And what's next?
Our children must travel abroad
just to see their history.
So don't you see that you and I
are the only possible defense
from governments trying
to strip us of our culture?
So l hope you can help me do this, if only
for the future generations of our people.
All right. l'll be honored to help.
Thank you, Fei Hung.
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.
- Where is everyone?
- Yeah. There's no one here.
I'll go take a look.
What the...?
Let's go! Let's go! Move!
- What do we do?
- Follow me.
Here l go!
Get him!
All right, lift it!
Here, Fei Hung!
Let's go!
- Oh, they started.
- Oh, l see the fun's begun.
Sounds great.
When you hire the Ax Gang,
you're sure to get the job done.
That's what we're paying for.
Fei Hung, here!
Fei Hung!
Oh, my God! No!
Fei Hung! Your shirt, take it off!
Okay!
- Quickly, now, go!
- This way!
Go! Go! Move it!
Run! Go on!
What's this?
- What's going on?
- Don't get involved.
- Get on out of here.
- Now. Go on.
- Help.
- That's Fu Wen Chi!
That hurt!
Hey!
Fu Wen Chi!
- There!
- Master Fu!
- Master Fu! Get behind!
- Help! Help!
Easy, easy!
Try to stop the bleeding.
Don't die!
Hold on! Master Fu!
We'll go for a doctor!
You'll be all right!
The royal seal...
- I know. We'll get it.
- Don't worry. l'll find it.
The embassy. Go quickly.
- What do we do?
- Tonight.
Hold on, Master.
My father will take care of you.
I promise. Don't give up!
- Come on!
- You'll be all right!
No, Master Fu! Come on!
Master--
What are you thinking?
Nothing!
- Tsang Sang?
- Fei Hung?
Come on! You almost killed me!
What are you doing here?
Me? What are you doing here?
Come on.
- So where's the seal?
- How should l know? Let's go.
Here.
Anybody see you?
No. I can't see. You got a light?
Of course. Hold it.
Down.
Looking for something?
Is this what brought you here?
I hope you don't mind.
We've taken the liberty to document
your stay at our magnificent embassy.
Please do enjoy our hospitality.
You can go straight to hell!
Good.
That'll be all, gentlemen.
We'll continue the plan as scheduled.
Yes, sir.
Things have worked out rather well
now that we have the jade seal back
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.
That's right.
I've already sent the embassy photographs
of Fei Hung and his friend to Master Wong.
He'll sell just like l told you.
- He has no choice.
- Make sure he understands, John,
that we expect him to vacate
the Po Chi Lam immediately,
or we'll plan to execute Fei Hung.
Damn those boys!
Don't they understand
there's nothing we can do?
As an embassy,
they're exempt from the laws of China.
- Maybe we can reason with them. l'll go.
- Sit down!
You know what they want,
the rights to Po Chi Lam!
They just wanted to return the seal.
They aren't the criminals.
- You disowned him!
- You spoiled him!
- This is all your fault!
- This is all your fault!
You're impossible.
And you're his father.
We're running out of time.
We've got to do something.
- You're right.
- I refuse.
How can l? You know this land has
been in our family for centuries.
There has always been a school here.
What would you do, just give it up?
I'll never do it.
Oh, really?
What would his mother have done?
I bet l know!
Sister, l need your wisdom
more than ever.
What can we do for Fei Hung?
Can you help us?
Release them.
You okay? Just go on.
Thank you.
- Stepmom.
- Just look at you.
I'm gonna be all right.
- Madam Wong.
- Are you okay, Master?
Some bruises, but l'll be fine.
- So, what will we do now?
- What do you mean?
Master Wong has sold
the school to the embassy.
He did what?!
How could that be?
Don't you see?
They made him sell it.
He had to or they would kill you both.
You're just lucky to be alive.
Fei Hung, this fight is over.
We can't do this anymore.
I hope you know your father
has sacrificed everything.
I wish that they had killed me.
Now, Fei Hung, that is enough.
Life's changes are like a moving river.
What's here today is gone tomorrow and
tomorrow brings a whole new journey.
Let's move forward and live.
So when will the ship be leaving?
In 10 days.
And everything's ready?
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.
Good.
I want to close down the factory,
lay off the workers,
and transport the shipment
to Hong Kong.
Pick it up.
Yes, sir.
First we work overtime!
We refuse, then they beat us!
And now they think they can
just fire all of us just like that!
So are you guys going to
let him get away with that?
What do you say, huh?
Tsang Sang, what's going on?
They closed the mill,
and you know what?
It was English ambassador
who was in charge of doing it.
Sounds like trouble.
I don't think l can help you.
Oh, sure. You didn't lose your job.
Well, l'm not gonna
let them push us around.
Yeah. As soon as they
finished the last shipment,
they fired all the men.
And you think they have
something to do with it?
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out for sure.
Let me think what it could be.
We should check the office.
Fei Hung, could that be it?
Well, we know they're up to something.
- Find a way into the factory.
- Okay.
Then we'll find a way to stop them.
- Come on!
- Let's go.
What--? What's this?
My God! Look what they're doing!
Well, we've got to stop them.
- I'll tell Fei Hung.
- Hurry, Fo Sang!
In a hurry?
Sorry.
Let go!
Go get help!
- Fo Sang, this way!
- No. I've got to tell Fei Hung.
Get out of here!
Bring Fei Hung!
Go now!
Madam, they're coming out.
All right, keep it down.
- Then we can organize.
- A good idea. Good day.
Good-bye. Have a safe trip.
Take care of the baby.
I will.
Fei Hung?
- Yes, Father?
- Don't get up. Keep working.
- Are you almost through with that?
- Almost finished.
Then start another one.
I'll make sure he does.
It's my responsibility.
Listen. He's not allowed to leave.
You understand me?
- Perfectly.
- All right, good.
You know, dear, l've been thinking
about names for the baby.
If we were to have a boy,
he could be Wong Tei-Pau.
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.
Nice. Both names are fine.
But do we really
need to pick one now?
- What if l'm early?
- That shouldn't be a problem
- if you take it easy till I get back.
- Of course.
- Fei Hung?
- Yes?
- Water the plants.
- Oh, l will!
- Dr. Wong, it's time!
- Hold on! l've got to go.
- Have a safe trip.
- Remember, get lots of rest.
We'll be fine. Don't worry.
Fei Hung and l will be just fine.
Go! We don't have any time to spare!
Hurry!
We've got to get Ching out of there.
I hope he's still alive.
What can we do?
I'm going to stop them.
I'm going to do what I can!
I gave my promise to Fu Wen Chi!
What do you think?
- Let's go.
- Hey, wait, where are you going?
- I'm going to battle!
- But--
But wait, madam,
you can't go in your condition.
What condition?
Come on, l'm only pregnant.
Oh, madam, please.
Think about the baby.
What if something were to happen?
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.
I'll go get my students.
Meet me at the mill.
Right. I'll gather up the men.
Oh, thanks, Fei Hung.
- You're with us, right?
- Yeah, okay.
- Will you be all right?
- I'll be fine.
- Good.
- But what if Father finds out?
Oh, go on.
Who cares now what your father thinks?
- Only make me proud.
- I will. Okay.
- Fei Hung!
- Yeah?
Something for good luck.
I can use it.
Protest unreasonable closure,
demand reasonable compensation!
Protest unreasonable closure,
demand reasonable compensation!
Don't get carried away
Get back! Get back!
You step aside now!
We demand justice!
We know what you have in there!
Those antiques are not yours,
and we won't let them out of China!
You have no right to them.
Is that right?
Charge!
No! No guns!
Fei Hung,
you've got to rescue the Jade!
Wait!
Fei Hung!
No!
Wait!
- You gotta find jade.
- Let's go!
Yeah. Let's go.
That drunken guy is here!
We got to do something!
All right, get him!
Wait!
Do you realize what you're doing?
You're helping them steal our history,
our culture.
You mean these?
They're of no use to anyone.
- If they want to buy them, l'll gladly sell.
- I won't let you do it.
And what are you
gonna do about it?
Listen here,
nothing's gonna stand in my way,
