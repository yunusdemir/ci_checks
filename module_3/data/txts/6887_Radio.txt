In independent India
women are seen as sex symbols
To out sisters from Kausu Banu
to the girl in Delhi we dedicate this movie
We pray that this kind of dedication
should not arise any more
Bless us all, Mother!
Chotanikara Goddess
Give us your protection, Mother
Mother! Chotanikara Goddess
Can you tell me where is
psychiatrist Desouza's house
This is the way to go to Cochin
Everyone has to come here
You stand here
We want justice for
Vadakekara woman trafficking
Police must arrest those
who raped the 18 year old girl
Police must arrest those
who raped the 18 year old girl
Dear! We'll reach soon
Don't worry
- Dear! Dear!
- I told that day itself
Law cannot give justice
to poor people like us
Police must arrest those
who raped the 18 year old girl
Police must arrest those
who raped the 18 year old girl
We want justice for
Vadakekara woman trafficking
No, no! It is just a family vacation
I'll be back on 20th
After coming I'll call you, Ok?
As you said that day do you really
have a haunting past, Manu?
There is nothing called past
It is the present which matters
Jesus!
Zakhir Hussain!
As you said 2 girls are there
Both are new
Hello, sir! The necklace is ready?
Shall I send it?
Then our Jose has come
He called me just now
There are 2 of them
Both are fresh
Life is a peaceful journey
The payment sometimes comes
in the form of love
Leave that
I need to buy a new chappal
Run, run!
Run, run
These children
The children are naughty
They are not bothered about teachers
You were also like this only
That time if you had studied properly,
you won't have had to climb coconut trees
- What is in the bag?
- It is seasoned oil and pickle
We may not get it there
- Greetings, sir
- Greetings
Didn't you go
to Shangu's farm?
I'll go tomorrow
Today I'm busy
Oh, busy?!
Just because roaming around that master
don't think that you'll get his daughter
She is a smart and educated girl
Now she is going to join
for job in town
That too with our Bombay Johnson
You have no chance
You keep quiet
If that sir hears,
what will he think?
As if no one knows about it
In the end you'll be singing...
"Manasamaine Varu..."
I may have to hear that too
That is why I told you this, dear
Are you not coming?
I'm coming, sir
Leave me
Are you in company
with all the useless?
One, two, three
Useless kids
I won't jump
I'll get down
- What is it?
- What is what?
- Have you heard of this Dharavi
- No
We have heard of water vapor,
water vapor
Is it distilling the water?
Slum! Slum area
It is world famous
This is a dialogue said by
Lalettan in Aaran Thamburan
So Balettan has started
to tell Lalettan's dialogue?
Tell once
- Tell it once more
- Leave, leave me
Stop it
- Who are they?
- Are you not ashamed?
No, that is why we are begging
Sister!
Your youngster's gang
has come
Come fast
Stop it
Don't beat like this
and stop my mother's breathing
Take it! It is 3 weeks
since Christmas is over
Can't you stop it at least now?
This time the collection
was not as we expected
Recession
Everything is very expensive now
Oh dear! Even though they are children,
they behave like elders
Behaviour
Next it'll be Onam
Won't you come for that?
If you don't come,
give the money to sir
Ok, sir
Come on, come on,
Let us go fast
Come fast
Let us run
I'll hit you all
Is this Johnson?
Is it a long time
since you came Johnson?
I came just now
I had a nap and a cup of tea
Shall I get you a cup of tea?
- Not now
- Let us have a cup of tea
Make it two
Are you still in Mumbai, Johnson?
Should I change it?
Dear, have a look at this
- Where did you get it from?
- This is from our Shivashankaran's shop
Even though it is old
It is from Gulf
- Look at this!
- Let me see
There are two to three holes
Even then it is ok
This is enough
Let me see
You could have
bought a better one
She has to mingle with people
This is enough, mother
You pack everything in this
Take this!
This too
Keep your certificates carefully
This is seasoned oil and pickle
You may not get it in town
Seasoned oil and pickle
is a good combination
- Shall we start?
- Take everything
Do you need to go now itself?
There is still time
for auspicious time to start
You leave after some time
Auspicious time
would be given in calendar
Sir!
Sir! Is it from bank?
Didn't you tell them?
She is the one who has to
find solution for all this
To pay back the loan
on this house
To treat her
To educate her
and bring to a state
My child is leaving
with all this burden in her shoulder
I'm not eager to send her forjob
There is no other way
You need not worry, sir
In these days if you have daughters
who love their family...
...there won't be any problem
Everything will be fine
We shall leave
Come
You leave before
bad time starts
Are you not going, sir?
Today is the day
for her check up
Johnson has to go back
to Mumbai today
Except him we don't know
any one there
Sir, do we need to send her alone?
If you want, I'll also go
Why should you come?
I'm there
What is your problem?
Ravi, Johnson is not an outsider to us
You must study well
Give mother medicines on correct time
Father's medicine is kept in almairah
Mother's medicine is in shelf
Don't sleep like buffalo
Get up at 5 o'clock
and give herbal medicine to mother
Dear!
Please, look after them
You know they don't have
anyone other than you
Don't be late
Start
Let us pray to god
and make a move
I shall leave
Till bus stop I'll come
Dear!
Bless you
Give it, here
Repair this
It is years since
you are meddling with this
First you repair this
I'll tune this
- Give it to me
- You repair that first
- Give it to me
- I'll give
Isn't there anything inside?
Nothing can be heard
We need to go there
Take it
Take this
I'll give money
No need! I'll give
Take it
Come
You wait here
I'll see and come
I need to meet Zakhir Hussain sir
What should I tell him?
Johnson
Daravi Johnson
Sir, one Johnson has come
- Tara...
- It is not Tara
Daravi!
Sorry! Daravi, Johnson
Sir! You can go
Come!
Come!
Keep that bag there
- Take the certificates
- Ok
This Zakhir Hussain sir is a big shot
You pay your respect to him
Good morning, sir!
Johnson! Come, come
Sit down
This is the girl I told you about
That girl?
Have you worked
in jewellery shop before?
- No, this is the first time
- Is it?
That means
you have no experience
Usually in jewelry shops
only sales men are kept
This is gold
It must be handled carefully
She will learn slowly everything
Isn't it Johnson?
You must learn
about making charge in jewelry
But here mostly
we have sales girls
I'll teach accounts
and all to you
Ask that Dhamayanthi to come here
Have you brought your certificates?
Show all of them to me
This is just for security
When gold and woman unite
it is a problem
It is like jaggery and ant, isn't it?
May I come in, sir?
<i>I was waiting with thousand eyes</i>
<i>You were the one</i>
<i>who flew away from me</i>
<i>Parrot! My parrot!</i>
She is a new girl
She doesn't have any experience
You teach her everything nicely
Come
Johnson! If I find any problem,
I'll dismiss her
There is no problem
It is I who is saying this
If you say so Johnson,
I have no problem
Shall I leave? Bye!
Keep your things there
- How much educated are you?
- Graduation
Do you know English?
What are you doing there?
- What is the matter?
- Madam, I came to drink water
Drink!
Drink it
Don't complaint that I'm a supervisor
who doesn't give water to drink
Go!
Go away
Change your costume
Varsha! Give uniform kit
Change dress
Tie up your hair
Dress stylishly like this
and come to the sales, okay?
Come!
How are you?
- How old are you?
- 23
In this uniform
you look older
I'm just 25
When I wear chudidar it'll be 23
But in this uniform
I look like 35
You need not smile
Here there are some disciplines
You must behave decently
with customers and me
That is the eligibility
for a sales girl
Many types of customers will come
But our motive is only sales
Do you understand?
They'll see sometimes here
and there and talk to us
Don't mind all that
When a customer comes
you must welcome them
See, good morning, madam
Good afternoon, sir
- Good evening, sir
- Excuse me, darling!
This is not an evening, Damayanti
It is a wonderful
and blissful morning
- Good morning, sir
- Good morning, dear
- How are you?
- I'm fine
New designs are there
Okay! It is for a special gift
I'll have a look
New girl has become fresh
That is Dr Daniel Desouza
He is our regular customer
He'll buy all the new designs
that come here
Last week he took
three new designs from here
Today I'll have a good harvest
Priya! Come
Not here
You come there
- What is this?
- Madam!
The minute you come here
you are trying to wear the necklace
It is not some ordinary thing
that you can wear and see
In this way
you'll take all this and go
This is not a job meant for you
I'll inform this to
the manager now itself
By today I'll end your job here
- Madam!
- Come, come on
Madam!
I told you to come
On seeing ornaments
even Sonia Gandhi will try it out
That is the nature of women
Are you harassing her
for just seeing a necklace?
Shweta! You don't interfere in this
How can I remain quiet, madam?
We are all workers
If a customer demands,
not only on neck...
...we should be ready to do a demo
by keeping in hip and chest
That is decency
This...
What is this Shweta dear?
We are all workers
Aren't we one?
Isn't it?
Then you go
What a girl?
I'll teach you
- What is your name?
- Priya
Before she was the sweeper here
Now she is the supervisor
That is why she is showing off
She can only talk
Come
Priya! What happened
to your accommodation?
They said they'll arrange for that here
It will take one weeks time for that
Till then you stay in some hostel
or relatives house
Else you can go and come
Is your house nearby?
- No! It is in Aramula
- Then you take leave
You join after one week
I'll tell sir
You don't worry
It is for one week only
If it is okay,
you can stay with me
I must tell Ravi
that my accommodation is okay
- Who is this Ravi?
- He is our neighbor
He is a generous man
Stop, stop Stop
- Rs 100 is gone
- Stop it! Stop
Stop, stop
Stop, stop! Is it very difficult
for you to stop vehicle?
Do you have license?
- It is there
- There is no helmet
Then you pay Rs 500
- Isn't Rs 100 the usual charge?
- Then are you regular?
Only when you pay Rs 500
you'll remember
Then I'll have to pay Rs 500
Madam, no need to pay anything
You are IG's... No
SP's... Your face is very familiar
Allow madam to go
- Okay
- Go, madam! Go
Thank you, sir
Okay, sit
She is...
Come
- It is 11th floor
- Isn't it enough if we go this way?
To climb the step?
Are you scared of lift?
Not scared!
But...
Even then you are scared, isn't it?
Come
God!
Krishna!
Come
Let us go
Come
How big it is?
Is it your own?
No! It is one of my friends
It is not enough to say as friend
A person who brought me
to this city and got me a job
They are going to sell this
Till then only!
Sister!
Sister!
What is it?
Is it you?
When did you come?
I came to that Varghese flat
Business discussion
Don't be scared
This is Manu
There is only discussion
and liquor there
There is no heavy food there
So I thought I'll come here
and eat something
I had a duplicate key
It is tasty
- Who is this new person?
- New appointment
There is a small problem
in accommodation
She will be here
with me for sometime
You are anyway in kitchen
- Make 2 cups of tea
- What?
Tea!
Come
You unnecessarily got scared
Is he that person about
whom you told, sister?
Love
Is this the symbol of love
in your native place?
Many people have asked me this
Once a man and woman become friendly
the world will say like that
Manu is actually my caretaker
A man who is above love,
faith and affection
I'll give!
Shweta, phone
You sit!
- Hello!
- You sit
What did you say your name is?
Priya
Priya, we are not just friends
We are actually business partners
I have real estate business
She is also into it
- Which is your native place, Priya?
- Aramula
- What happened?
- Okay, I'll go
Then you both converse
I'll go!
Priya! We'll see
We must see
- Okay? Bye!
- Bye!
Then, in kitchen there is rice
and chicken curry
You need not waste
It is quiet tasty
Aramula girl! You must accept
that the food is tasty, okay?
From here you can see
this whole city
The streets will never have any rest
Speedy vehicles running here and there
People who travel in the same direction
with different aims
Daily I have my dinner
seeing this sight
Today I have one more
person for company
See there! An aero plane
will come from there
It'll fly and go above our head
The time will be 8:30
Then it'll return back
At 1:30 in night
Sometimes I sleep only after that
Sister! Aero plane
Priya! I'm going out
You lock the door and sleep
It is gone
Priya! I'm going out
I'll come soon
I have the key with me
I'll open it myself
Will I have to remain alone?
Don't be afraid
I'll come back soon
- I'll lock
- Okay
Lord Rama! Lord Rama!

Go straight
Sister, we can go this way also
- You have to go to jewelry only
- No need to go this way
Go straight
Stop the auto
Stop the vehicle
The bill must be implemented
The bill must be implemented
No need to go that way
Find a solution to the farmer's problem
Stop the vehicle
Find a solution
to the farmer's problem
The bill must be implemented
Even on a day of strike
will you drive auto?
I was taking it to the stand
If you start the vehicle from here,
we'll burn it
Brother, is it a sudden strike
What is the reason?
Only on knowing the reason
will you stop driving?
You idiot!
- Are you happy now?
- Sorry!
If you walk this way,
you'll come to the railway gate
Cross the gate
Take the second cut on the right
You'll reach behind the jewelry
The bill must be implemented
The bill must be implemented
The farmers should be
given compensation
The bill must be implemented
What for are we doing this strike?
What for are we doing this strike?
Obey the decisions of the party
Don't question anything
In Japan the tsunami affected people
must be given help
That is what is very much needed
Here in our country
also there was tsunami
The farmers should be
given compensation
Sometimes this strike is a blessing
Why?
That is why this beautiful girl
agreed to come in my bike
Priya! Priya!
Aramula queen!
- What happened?
- Strike! I lost my way
- Is it for the jewelry?
- Yes
Sit! I'll drop you
Sit!
Sit
<i>Peacock! Peacock!</i>
<i>Oh Girl! Oh Girl! How is all this?</i>
On a strike day
will jewelry shop function?
I don't know
If I don't go, they might scold me
<i>Till now you have not seen</i>

<i>Your heart is jumping seeing this,</i>
<i>village Peacock</i>
<i>Oh Girl! Did in your eyes</i>
<i>jasmine blossom?</i>
<i>Oh Girl! Did in your eyes</i>

Come
The farmers should be

The bill must be implemented
The farmers should be
given compensation
She is alright
In fear she lost conscious
- Can we go, doctor?
- Of course
For two days take care of the wound
Don't allow it to get wet
Don't be scared
Two stitches have been put
That is all
Hello, Manu!
No, she has been discharged
We are going to the flat
You come there
Come
- Is your mother a heart patient?
- Yes
- How did you know this, sister?
- Your father had phoned
- He must have got scared
- No, I didn't tell him all this
Your mother needs an angiogram
- There is some monetary problem
- What to do?
- Can I ask an advance in salary?
- You need not worry
I have told your father to come
For the time being
I'll give you some money
That is not needed
Now itself you are doing a lot for me
How am I going to
pay back for all this?
Oh! Self respect
I'm just lending you
Give it back when you get salary
<i>I'm waking up</i>
<i>I'm spreading my wings and flying</i>

Mother! Sister has come
Sister!
Is this Priya?
What happened?
Why did you call me?
Where is mother?
I'll tell all that
You come in
You also come, dear
- When did you come, uncle?
- It is some time
When there is a necessity in family
how can I remain without coming?
- After all I'm your relative
- You come
What is it, mother?
Why did you call me in a hurry?
- What is the urgency here?
- I'll tell you all that
First you go and have bath
Then you change all this dress
Don't make me tensed, mother
Tell me what is the matter?
Something special
is there for you, sister
- For me?
- Yes
You built good life to all of us
You are still alone
Don't you also need a good life?
You have worked enough
Now you are working for whom?
After marriage if you want,
you can work
Today a boy's party
is coming to see you
He is working in bank
He is very smart
I have seen him
So all of you have decided
to get me married
When I want to get married
I'll tell you
- It is not needed now
- Then when will you get married?
After you become old?
How long can a girl remain
unmarried in a family like this?
It is due to your hard work
all this came
It is true
But when we tell the matter
people ask us in what kind of a job are you
Sometimes hearing all that
we feel really ashamed
Even if I'm a distant relative
I'm also your uncle
Brother, you go and sit there
When I tell the matter
none of them likes it
What does Dasan lack?
You rejected him directly
Even after that I come here
thinking after her dead father
At least you remember my father
It is good to that extent
Don't make me say anything more
Shweta! You go and sit there, brother
Who told them all to come here?
To make me remember old things
- I have not forgotten anything
- Dear!
When they come don't we need
a male member here?
Whoever is coming inform them
not to come here any more
Dear!
Are you so sensitive?
To avoid the groom party
are you sitting here?
Let them just see you and go
- Come
- I'll come
Let me remain here
for some more time
If you sit long in this breeze
you'll fall sick
I get little bit peace
when I sit here like this
This is our old house
My father built this with hard work
Even though it is a small house
in those days we were very happy
When I sit here I can see my father
I can realize his affection
Can you see that branch?
My father hanged himself from that
On the previous day
of my degree exam he did it
After removing the rope
his body was brought down
I was shocked
No one knew
why my father did that
It was later on that
we came to know that he had debt
He had taken money from everyone
The bank people were pestering him
Someone wrongly informed father
that if he committed suicide...
...bank will write off that loan
Then I had to look after sister,
mother and Anu
I stopped my studies and went to job
I thought our starvation
will be over with that
But I have reached till here today
Everyone told us to cut off this tree
But I have my father in this
To let down all my burdens
To cry my heart out
It is enough for me
to stay near my father
Are you both standing here?
They have reached
Why are you making me
stand like this, sister?
That you won't understand
if I tell you now
You will realize it
when you reach that life
When you reject all alliance
by giving one reason or another...
...lt is father's heart
also which gets hurt
You say yes only
if you like him, sister
Dear, a girl can't live alone
like this always
Who told you sister that a man
is compulsory for a woman?
I can't argue with you
You come!
Come
Give them
He is working in Citi Bank
Only he and mother are there at home
Lakshmi is staying nearby only
There is good horoscope match
We'll perform the marriage soon
We have no objection
to do the marriage even today
It is a ritual!
That's all
I'll take my daughter with me
If they want to talk anything,
they can talk
It is not like old days
You go with her
You go
We'll keep the marriage
before Karkadam month
There is no need to wait so long
We need to enquire about the boy
- There is nothing to enquire
- Then no need
If possible, we'll have it
this month itself
Are you very shy type?
I thought
you'll be a bold type
I was never interested
in getting married
I have heard that only a good actor
can shine in a marriage life
When my mother compels me a lot
I used to go to see girl
But this is not like that
Now I have really
decided to get married
I like you very much
Very good
What a pair do they make?
Isn't it over?
Hello, Manu!
We'll leave
One of you come home
and we'll decide the date
Yes
I tried all other ways
He is adamant that
he won't give it to me
It is a 40 crores contract
In one minute it'll go
in the hands of another guy
I can understand that, Gulabji
But company is not very happy
about your last year's performance
You know everything, Manu
I'll try maximum
Even then it is not in my hand
I'm just their PRO
The limitations of that are also there
That contract I must get it
How much I should pay?
Come!
You sit here
Hello, Mano
This is my colleague, Shweta
- Hello!
- Hello!
This is Gulabji
about whom I told you
The party is Shekar Shetty
Can it be done by us?
Let us see
You knock, it'll open
That is the saying
I have given Manu
an offer of 10 lakhs
We want that contract
That is not enough
I want 25 lakhs
Liquid cash
That too in advance
We'll see
No, we'll try
This is my friend, Priya
- Greetings!
- Greetings!
Manu, bye!
- Bye!
- Let's go
Hello, Manu!
Tell them that the contract is theirs
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
What do you want?
- A chain
- Come this way
She is that Shweta's friend
Shall we try?
- We'll make a try
- Sir, the chain section is there
Then that
- That is necklace
- Is it necklace?
- Yes
- Then that is enough
- Come
- Okay!
Come, sir
Priya, take out some good collections
Sabu, help her
Sit down
Sir, what is your budget?
- How costly can you show me?
- Do you remember us?
Sorry!
There is nothing
by which she'll remember us
See this, sir
- Mister! What are you doing?
- You get lost
Dear, are you not her friend?
- Come, let us go
- What is it? What happened?
Are you not selecting anything?
We did select
but she is not saying the rate
What is it?
What is the problem?
It is old man's luck
Come on
Old man! Me?
It is ok
This is usual for sales girls
I have gone through so much
For us beauty is a curse, dear
Do you know with what difficulty
I'm holding on here?
What happened?
Why are you sitting in dark?
What happened, dear?
Are you having fever? Let me see
Shweta!
What did you call me?
Shweta?
- I need to talk to you
- What happened to you?
Who are you?
Actually what is your business?
From where are you getting
so much money?
Oh! Like that
Do you only want to know this
or someone else also wants to know this?
Today two guys
came to the jewelry
They caught at my hand
Then they asked me a question
I'm old enough to understand
the meaning of that
Now you tell me
Who are you?
What is your actual job?
Where is it that you go at night?
From where do you get
so much money?
More than your beauty
the tears of your people have more value
The day you understand this,
you'll understand me
Dear, I achieved
all these with this body
To take care of those
who are depended on me I had only this
Due to that they are
all living happily
In your language it won't be wrong
if you call me as prostitute
You may feel that it is
a star call girl's chastely eloquence
I know about your problems
If you are interested,
you also have a good offer
That doctor
He'll just touch and caress you
Maximum one year
Only that much will be needed
You'll understand
actual financial freedom
Did you think
I'm like that?
For a girl her chastity
is more important than her life
To understand that you should
be born in a cultured family
Culture
Yes, it is due to my culture that till now
in this city no lusty eyes fell on you
Culture!
I'll not stay here any more
I owe you money
That I'll pay back
If I am alive
There is some money in that shelf
It is for mother's bypass
If you had forgotten, take that too
For that you need not beg to anyone
With the money you earned
by selling your body...
...I don't want to save my mother
It is better she dies
rather than that
I saw my own sister in you
Don't go out alone at this night
Not only this chastity
but even a nail won't be left
Outside decent police
will be waiting
Father!
Were you sleeping, daughter?
At home you used to
get up early morning
After coming to city
your habits have changed
Are you not feeling well?
- Father!
- Are you fine, dear?
Priya!
Here
She must hesitant to take it
- She was brought up like that
- You both talk
You must be blessed
to get a friend like her
This is your mother's life
If not today,
tomorrow we'll have to give it back
At least she had
the heart to give it
Johnson, says that
if you work hard here...
...soon you'll have raise
in salary and promotion
May be Shweta has become like that
I'm not greedy for too much money
but many dreams...
...which I thought had lost
I have started to see again
I must get back the house
Maya should be educated well
If you also work like Shweta,
may be you'll also become rich like Shweta
The things which I thought
I'll be never able to get...
...l've started to achieve little by little
The wish in my heart has revived
Shall I leave?
Dear! I'm leaving
You have lunch and then go
I have work
Bye, dear
Did you hear
what your father said?
If you have money
people will come searching for you
No one will ask
from where you got it
Priya! The source of income of a woman
is enquired only by her husband
That too some virtuous husbands
Call the doctor
I'm ready
Life is sometimes like that
Till yesterday whatever was our decision
and belief will change in one minute
Our route will change
With that the ways
Evening doctor's car
will come to the flat
I want to buy
a good pair of chappal
Okay
Come this way
- You also come
- Come on
Come on, come
Get in! Get in! Get in!
Go, get in
Women trafficking
- Come this side
- Walk inside
- Let us go
- Shweta! I know that girl
Can we save her?
- Let us go
- Shweta!
If I was in this situation?
Promise! What I'm saying is true
Come
Come on
Get in
Sir!
Get in
Get in
Won't you listen to what we say?
What is it?
This girl has been cheated
Can you release her, sir?
Is it social service?
Go, go
Else I'll arrest you also
for prostitution
Do you want that?
Sir, you'll follow rules only in places
were there is betrayal like this...
...or where for one time meal
they do prostitution
For the corporate, politicians,
and businessmen here there are madams
Who in exchange for bundles
of notes do prostitution
Against them
you won't take any action
If you do anything like that
you'll know their power
Don't talk too much
You are teaching
this Varghese about the law
Sir, be careful
If you touch her,
you'll burn your hand
Madam, sir is new here
Are you a feminist?
This was a raid done
to impress everyone
In between we must also
do something like this, madam
If you know that girl,
you come to the station and sign
- I'll release her
- Get inside the jeep
Sir, in front of hunger
we are not able to sustain
How much ever a big shot one be...
...when there is no other way
we are bound to do this
- Get in the jeep
- Are you talking in front of sir?
Madam, you come to the station
- Sir, is she a feminist?
- Yes
- Is the other one an activist?
- Yes
- Sir, who is this activist?
- That is... the one who does work
Then feminist?
The one who makes the other work
Thank God! I'm saved
My anger is not subsiding, pig!
Don't hit him, sir
Even after all this
is it not enough for you?
- You and your love
- I can't forget him
Can't you hear this, pig?
Amer! What is this?
- My anger is not going, sir
- A person will come for her bail
- You leave it
- Sir, this is a serious issue
By acting love, he gained her belief
and he has sold her to many guys
Now itself she is telling
the name of some 10 guys
Many of them are powerful men
If media and activist interfere...
For some days some people
can play around this issue
Then there will be
controversy over that
At last everyone will give up
We'll make this a petty case
and release them
Sir, this is the problem
with we policemen
You are happy
of getting a lottery
If your aim is money,
whether we charge this case or not...
...what we have to get we'll get
Whether a molestation case
is publicized or covered...
...it is the same for us
On seeing a name in diary
or mobile phone...
...if you call any powerful guy,
what we have to get we'll get
There it comes
Take sign from them
and release her
If you plan to look after her
after getting her released in bail...
...it won't work out
I have informed all those
whom I have to
Release her
Come
Jose! A molestation case
Keep space in the front page
I think this molestation
must be a big case
We might require
a second edition
Evening paper
will have a good time
I think everyone has reached
OB Van is not seen
Will it be live?
We'll take 2 days leave
We'll have to take part
in the protest
Yes, yes
Do not cry
- Here they come
- Take the photos
- Take the photo
- Move all of you
They have been released
Why are you making an issue of it?
Move away
Move
Move all of you
- Sir!
- What is it?
Say two lines
We can give that as flash news
What is this? Are you not ashamed?
Why did you cover up this case?
- Come
- My God!
Where does she stay?
How old is she?
Will you please go
without troubling us?
Madam, where will you
be taking this girl?
We'll need rest of the details too
This is a case where activist
and feminist both are involved
There is going
to be a real coverage
Already the banners are ready
You take it from me
There will be immediate details
The CI has come just now
CI says that one of the officers
tried to write off the case
You keep everything ready
Geetha! Indu!
Take this
Move away
Move
- Show mercy to her
- You move away
Leave her
Without any sympathy
this girl was molested
Take the photo of her face
- Listen
- Take this
Cover her face with this
Girl! Who all molested you?
Let the channel people cover first
One minute
This girl is pregnant
The one responsible for this pregnancy
are powerful men's of this society
Even the police tried
to write off this case
This is a challenge
to the women of this society
Let us go
It is not over
First we must take this girl
to hospital
Give me I'll say
She is still not a major
Still she has been molested by many
We want that against
those people action must be taken
Come, let us go
All those who molested her
should be punished
Action must be taken against
those who molested this 18 year old girl
The SI who tried to write off
this case must be suspended
We could not save that girl
- You get down
- Ok, bye!
- Good morning, sir!
- Good morning!
- What do you want?
- I... I want to meet Shweta
- Who should I say it is?
- Say that it is her friend
This friend's friend
is on leave today
Can you tell me where her flat is?
I'll go and meet her there
You ask that girl
She is her room mate
Thank you!
Hello! Hello!
Where are you going?
You go and sit there
That girl will come and tell you
Ok
I don't know from where they come?
They will call themselves as friend
Priya, there is a guest for Shweta
Guest? Who?
Ah!
- Who could it be?
- Please, come, sir
In Cochin there was
again a molestation case
An 18 year old girl
was molested by 18 men
Police tried to write off the case
Due to which there was a protest
by the feminist group of people
Excuse me, who is it?
Is it ready?
I came to see Shweta
I heard that she is on leave
Give me the address of the flat
Shweta has gone to the hospital
She has a head ache
She'll be back by afternoon
Okay, I'll wait
Can you give me
her phone number?
That... One minute
Shweta!
- Hello!
- Hello!
Where are you?
Jayan has come
Which Jayan?
The one who came
to see you for marriage
One minute
Why did he come there?
I'm busy
Somehow get rid of him
She says she will be late to arrive
That is ok
I'll wait
I'll meet her and then only go
Hello! What to do?
He says he'll meet you
and then only go
I'll come
Sorry! It is an emergency
I'll have to go
What is the matter?
Do you need to go now itself
You came just now
and you want to go
Go after sometime
Please! We'll meet
some other day
Please!
She told me to ask you to wait
Okay
Give it to Jayan
One second
It is Shweta
Shweta! What happened?
Are you not feeling well?
I have a headache
I'll be late to come
It is ok
I'll wait here
We won't be able to talk there
We'll meet in the evening
in coffee bar, okay?
Ok, Shweta
Thank you!
Thanks!
What happened?
You look gloomy
I did say I'll go
But as the time
is nearing I feel tensed
Why?
My future
Apart from a man's 6 feet body
a lady's life is far spread
Like a woman a man
should also have chastity
When a woman does it is wrong
When 2 people together are making
a mistake why only a man is justified?
- If it is wrong, both are wrong
- I don't know anything about this
Why do you remain
without knowing?
Priya! Actually a woman
should remain faithful to a man...
...that is to her husband
only after marriage
Before that situation
can make anything of her
A family is much more valuable
than the beauty which will get lost
To not to lose that family
we make a small adjustment
That is what we are doing
Priya! Has anyone used you?
I mean...
I was first time
used by an old man
That was a senior bank manager
Even today I'm not clear
whether that was a rape...
...or I gave in to his demands
That too before a week
of my father's death
I was called to the guest house saying
he wanted to talk to me about the bank loan
When I returned back home
I had the document of the house in my hand
For days together I remained
in a closed dark room at home
I thought I was going mad
That time my mother
and sisters were with me
They cried for my sake
Shweta!
There is a truth
that I have understood
The most valuable thing
on this world is a woman's body
The thought that woman is meant
for only crying...
...and to be betrayed
must be changed first
Even when a woman remains faithful
to a guy whole life...
...she need not expect any sympathy
from him when she cries her heart out
Even than not a single woman
is ready to learn this truth
When a woman loses her chastity
it is a sad thing for her
But for a man it is a celebration
All the men found happiness
when they used me
But I had only
a numb feeling inside me
In all our life a thing
called circumstance comes
So maximum one year
You must have relation
with the doctor only that long
After that you get married
Then family
Even then never
have any guilty conscious
Think that it was
for the welfare of everyone
It is like a door
which opens slowly
- Think only that much
- If that door opens to the road?
Are you not going to meet Jayan?
I will meet him
Else he might again come
to the jewelry
Keep this
No need
I'll go in an auto
You are sweating
Wipe it
You'll get a good girl as wife, Jayan
Please, don't say that
Even though we have met only once...
...later on I realized that the meeting
has a life of many births
Life is not a film dialogue, Jayan
It is a crystal
In that people are like toys
that have very less life
For degree was your
subject literature?
How did you know that?
The words that you use
are very powerful
- Do you read a lot?
- Reading and me?
If I have ever read anything,
that is life
- Life is the biggest book
- Shweta!
Do you know
where a person's real beauty lies?
Is it face?
A person's real beauty
lies in his sadness
Unhappiness
Here! Like you
Mother! One minute
I'll give it to Shweta
My mother! You talk to her
Is it you dear?
Are you fine?
Yes
After seeing you that day I also want...
...that only you should come
as my daughter-in-law
Then there was no news from your side
It was I who sent him there forcibly
I have talked with your mother
They are all very excited
Is it ok with you, dear?
Hello, dear!
- Mother, I...
- I'm going to tell in your house
That it is ok from your side
Shall I tell?
Mother...
Sir! Bill
- Shweta, please!
- It is ok
Please, I'll pay
- Thank you, sir!
- You leave, Jayan
You have to travel far
You have got totally wet
What happened?
Didn't you meet Jayan?
It is the fate of a girl like me
to always stand in storm
Then did you say no?
Very bad! It was a good alliance
That is what the problem is also, Priya
He is a good man
I thought there were
only 2 types of men
Drunkards and businessman
But he...
It is even wrong to think
about a life with him
For sometime I also wished that
I yearned for that life
We are all only ordinary girls
We can't forget the past
We can't get what we desire for
Even I'm also a girl
I also have desires
Didn't you say Shweta that a girl should be
faithful to a man only after marriage?
Why should only woman have chastity?
Like woman a man must also have that
The mistake of woman
and man is the same
Like a mist clearing
Like a bundle of falling leaves
It is only that much
Even if it is life
It is easy to say
But when it becomes reality
then only we can understand its pain
Priya, it is easy to lose everything
But it is very difficult to get it back
Do you feel like not going?
I'll talk to doctor
I must go! Expecting me
there are some lives
For their sake I must go
Woman is like a mirror
It is beautiful only when it is intact
Once it is broken...
Aramula mirror
is not made of crystal
It is made of iron
Has the car come?
Priya!
Manu!
In this journey there is
no question and answer
Doctor!
Welcome, young man
She has come
Yes, yes
I was waiting
This is her first time
The kind of behavior
that you expect won't be there
Hey! Absolutely no problem
As you think I'm not a sexual sadist
It is affection
For some days I need a companion
Without bedmate
and any relationship
A small nest to stay
on top of a tree
When we wish
we can fly away
How about a drink for you man?
No, thanks!
Your wish
Manu!
Money
This is there a lot in my life
Now this is what I have in life
After my mother's death
I had a lonely childhood
Orphans like home where only atrocities
of my father were there
My wife and daughter went away
to states after status leaving me behind
Did you see, Manu?
Did you see my father?
After spoiling all my happiness,
see how he is smiling
Even after death I'm keeping him alive
to show him my success
Do you know why I have hung here
you stupid old man?
To see me grow
To see me happy
To see me flourish
See, see how I'm growing
What all you snatched away
is coming searching me
Can you see that?
Sick man
Do you know how it is to have
empty day time and lonely nights?
That is what I have for company?
I'm a psychiatrist
But I behave like a psycho
I'm going mad
I want it back
I want my happy times back
At least for some days
Okay? Ask her to come
Ask her to come
Ask her to come
Yes, yes
I never believed
that you'll come
Life is an incidental journey
In that love can also be an episode
Leave that
If you feel guilty, think about your house
and the situation there
Then you'll be able
to find some rights in that
You might feel
that I'm a pimp, isn't it?
Over my circumstances
I have worn a dress
I have felt guilty
Many times
At those times
I think about my Indrani
You go
Wow!
I dreamt a dream
Come
You are my mother
You are my mother
Mother!
My mother was an innocent woman
She wanted to make me
lie in lap and sing lullaby
Mother! Mother!
Come on, mother
Come, mother
It is so many days
since I saw you mother?
You look so beautiful
Come on, mother! Come
Mother, come mother
You sit down
Mother! Give me a kiss here
Mother! Shall I lie down here?
I'll lie here
<i>Bamboo, you are an orphan</i>
<i>You blow in breeze silently</i>
<i>It is widely spreading</i>
<i>The darkness is engulfing me</i>
<i>Smiles have gone far away</i>
<i>Loneliness has become my friend</i>
<i>There is sadness around me</i>
<i>There is sadness around me</i>
<i>Bamboo, you are an orphan</i>
<i>You blow in breeze silently</i>
<i>Helplessness and sorrow</i>
<i>is what is left</i>
<i>There are non stop tears</i>
<i>flowing from my eyes</i>
<i>Who is the one caressing me</i>
<i>with invisible hands?</i>
<i>I'm trying to purify myself</i>
<i>in this nature's water</i>
<i>There is never ending sorrow</i>
<i>My heart is heavy with this burden</i>
<i>In the middle of this a ray</i>
<i>of sunlight can be seen</i>
<i>Days are passing</i>
<i>by in this manner</i>
In the inside almairah I have bought
and kept a gown for you
Wear that and come
My God!
Veronica!
Veronica!
Today you are my Veronica
I and Veronica were in love
We united in the cemetery
were there are only souls
You were born in a fog covered
Jerusalem hut
You died...
No, no no
You committed suicide
by cutting your veins
There was non-stop blood flowing
Why did you commit suicide?
Why did you commit suicide?
Why? Why did you commit suicide?
Why are you in this dress?
Today I'm Veronica
I was born in a fog covered
Jerusalem hut
I died...
No I committed suicide
by cutting my veins
The blood from my body
flowed and flowed
Did the madness of doctor
catch on to you?
Some bit
I'm now supposed
to live as doctor's characters
Sometimes wife,
sometimes mother
Then many of them
whom he could not get in his life
Sometimes I myself is not able
to make out who I'm, Manu
I'm also responsible
for this state of yours, isn't it?
Priya, this is not
guiltiness or regret
Shall I give you a life?
Life is an incidental journey
In that love can also
be an episode
Leave that
I have only had losses
Even Shweta is avoiding me now
She is not even
bothering to face me
There are still some commitments
which only Shweta can do
She must have become fed up...
...or she must be thinking of
stopping everything and becoming peaceful
It is not possible for her
to leave just like that
She has started to wish
for a new life
What can she do?
After fulfilling all responsibilities
now she wants to go to a new life
She can do that
but now only Shweta is needed
- For some days at least
- Leave her, Manu
- Let her go to a good life
- I didn't go in search of any one
I have never compelled anyone
People with needs
came in search of me
She also
Without the dirt of this city
falling on them I took them...
...to the star bungalows of here
I got them good remuneration
I got them a good life too
I agree I also had benefits
For all that I had to pay
a very big price
A pimp
A name to make fun of me
This is a play on top of a thread
Tragedy is in front of the eyes
For that not to happen I must meet Shweta
You know where she is
I'll tell
Now you leave, Manu
Tell her that no one can avoid
anyone just like that
Especially those
who have some commitments
Shweta, are you still having fever?
Manu had come
- Then?
- He went
Didn't he say
he wanted to meet me?
How much ever we try to run away
the past will keep haunting us
I'm going to tell mother
that this marriage won't take place
At this last moment?
Have you thought
about your family people?
If this does not take place,
think about how sad they will be
After marriage
I'll be going to a bigger tragedy
It is better to finish of
all this earlier itself
Once we know that it is wrong
how much ever time we take...
My Priya! My Priya!
My great Priya!
With heart and body all people
have in one way or another done mistake
Even the biggest mistakes are forgiven
There are so many examples for that
Think that you have not lost anything
Think that a life
like that was never there
Hide away your past
in the basket of forgetfulness
Dream
Dream for a beautiful
and happy married life
How? How can I make justice?
Justice
That is where the importance
of arranged marriage lies
Till then two people
who doesn't know each other...
...after marriage
at first night they unite
Will husband and wife dare
to open their hearts in the first night?
If they do that, there will be time
for only divorce here
Some men go behind
other women
Even then he'll be adamant
that his wife should be pure
He can enjoy anyone's wife
This is a belief
Most of the marriage lives
are linked to that one belief
You can also do it
If a good life comes
and beckons, you can go
What ever you need
will be there, like this
Shweta, don't argue much
with Manu
Talk in good manner
and make him realize
Forget the past
and start a new life
- You do wish for that life
- It is not that I don't wish
But his one sight
also scares me now
He was a good friend of mine
He was a helper too
But now it is him that I fear
If I distance myself,
I don't know how he'll react
That is a thought
Think in a good manner
You are strength to me now
Won't you be there
with me in everything?
No! We must not
see each other any more
I'll not come
to the marriage also
That is what is good
for our future life
Why are you avoiding me?
If there was anything,
you should have told me
Manu, after two days
it is my marriage
Let it be
Believing you I took up
some assignments
Today one more day
I need you
I want you as that old sexy,
smart girl
Please, don't force me any more
Not only with body
I'm psychologically also trying to change
How can you say that?
But you can't leave
and go just like that
No, Manu
Please, don't compel her
You can say that
but this is a matter of existence for me
Shweta, I want only
this one night
One night
After that I'm ready to take any risk
and safely take you home
What? What did you say?
Day after tomorrow
I'll be the wife of another guy
How can I betray him...?
Why did you stop?
You can stand
in any confession chamber
How much ever you talk of chastity
you were a prostitute only
Do you know how much
I'll lose from all this?
There is more in this than
what you'll get by acting as my pimp
Start the car
<i>A few months later...</i>
Tea
Can't you come early
at least today?
Auditing is going on in bank
Even then I'll try
Did you forget that you had told me
you'll take me out?
I'll take you
I have not forgotten
Then we'll get
on with that ritual
We'll do the ritual
Sister!
Is she your daughter?
Let me tell you a matter
Why did she come here now?
Didn't you ask her?
She wanted to come
and stay here for a week
What is the use of staying here?
Sir, don't feel bad
if I tell you a matter
This is a good alliance
If they enquire about the girl's sister...
I won't say anything
- The neighborhood people know
- You go and sit there I'll come!
Idiot! She is spoilt
Now she'll spoil her
sister's life too
No father! I'll go away
If you want money,
you don't have to come any more
Send someone
Dear!
- Dear!
- God!
God!
- Ravi! Cut that branch too
- Okay
He scared me totally
Stop there, Ravi
Is he so much scared of me?
I heard you had come
Are you returning at once?
Are you well off?
I phoned many times
You don't answer my calls
There I have lot of work
I'm also thinking of
coming to town
There is no use of staying here
There at least
I can see you in between
Won't uneducated people
also get some job there?
Do you want money, Ravi?
Can you give me your new number?
When I come there
I'll phone you
Do not be scared
I won't show any friendship
You can say that I'm your
house servant or something like that
Ravi, please!
Don't say such things
This is okay
Then show the samples of those tiles
Okay, sir!
Ok
Hello, Manu!
Congratulations!
Thank you!
You have been selected
as the district governor of Tiger club
- Congratulations!
- Yes
Behind all prosperity there is
bound to be a vulnerable past
To reach the right place we might have
to travel through wrong route
I was in that journey to the right
I'm happy
The credit to all my victory
goes to her
Take it
I didn't introduce you both
This is Prateesh Nair
We were working in the same branch
here for some years
Now he is in Guruvayoor
Do I need to introduce her to you?
Prateesh will be here only
Come
When he was working in the branch here
he used to eat all 3 times from our house
He is very fond of the dosa
made by mother, isn't it?
He tried to get a room in lodge
I didn't allow that
I brought him here
You make two cups of tea
Come! Sit
Now don't you get new women?
It is good once in a while
That is a way of getting refreshed
There is no change
in your old habits
What is this you are doing, Shweta?
What has happened to you?
It is okay
Sorry!
You get that lungi
You give that glass to me
Come with me
and change your dress
Shweta! Sit down
Jayan! When you get time,
come with your Mrs to my house
We can go to Guruvayoor and pray
Let me see
She is a devotee
of Krishna
Is it?
Now day's women
are fond of Krishna
You also sit
Take sambar
Hey!
Get some water for him
to drink
Sit down
Haven't you stopped
your old habits till now?
Naughty man
Jayan!
Where are you going
in the morning?
After coming here if you leave
without seeing mother...
...I won't be able to live here
You wait for one hour
I'll go and get mother
Before afternoon
I have to reach Trivandrum
I'll do one thing
While in my return trip
I'll come here
By then mother will reach here
after marriage
That will never happen
Some 6 years back he left from here
saying he is going for morning walk
Then I met him
day before yesterday
Look after him,
else he'll go away
You stay here
This is my luck
Jayan met me again
He invited me to home
- I could again see you
- I don't understand
I'm not going to tell him anything
- You go and sit there
- Why are you getting tensed?
I didn't come to make you
remember the old things
You don't even think about it
But I'll tell you one thing
Life is meant to be enjoyed
I know that you can't forget me
Some debts of that sort
are still there between us
What debt?
Never lose a chance
to repay a debt
May be later on we might
have to feel sorry about that
To win in life
this kind of ways are also there
Prateesh, were you going
to leave without seeing me?
No
Come
Dear, Shweta!
You are becoming over busy
You didn't come for his marriage
When you came you could have
brought your wife and children
Mother, don't you know the matter?
She has delivered her second child
That too is a baby girl
It is all given by Guruvayoor Lord
Last time as you were
there we could pray peacefully in temple
- Mother, I'll leave
- Are you leaving?
I won't leave you
without having lunch
Mother, it'll become a problem
if he gets late to reach the bank
What problem?
You pick up that phone
and inform them
Leave is meant to be taken
in emergency
You both sit
Come
What is it, dear?
What happened to you?
Come
Shweta! Our life is not meant
to think about the past and cry
It is to feel happy about the good days
that are going to come
Why are you spoiling
the happiness of our family life?
Leave it
We don't have sorrow
and thoughts
Jayan! That...
I don't need to know anything
Come, let us sleep
Morning we'll have to reach
Rama's house for marriage
Isn't it?
Come
- Who is it?
- Who are you?
Doctor!
Who is this girl?
She is my patient, Daisy
I have told you not to call
patients at home
Idiot!
You come to the hospital
Sir, I'm Priya
Sir! Who am I?
Who I'm?
Sir, I'm Meera, Maria
Sir, I'm Veronica
I'm Veronica, sir
<i>Oh Girl! Oh Girl!</i>
<i>How is all this?</i>
<i>Oh Girl! Did you know</i>
<i>about this new world?</i>
<i>Till now you have not seen</i>
<i>a world like this</i>
Zakhir Hussain sir!
As you said 2 girls are there
Both are new
Life is a journey of incidents
Sometimes in that
love can come as episodes
Leave that
I need to buy a new chappal
Dear! Dear!
The police must take action against
those who raped this 18 year old girl
I have landed in Cochin
The Vadakekara girl trafficking
The enquiry is going on
You give some rich guys
phone numbers in Cochin
Give 10 cent land in South
A small building
Some 20,000sq feet
I won't get another chance like this
I have to just say that the name
is there in diary or phone
Police must arrest those
who raped the 18 year old girl
We want justice for
Vadakekara woman trafficking
Don't worry dear
We'll reach hospital just now
The police must take action against
those who raped this 18 year old girl
There is nothing called past
It is the present which matters
Take action against those
who raped this 18 year old girl
Take action against those
who raped this 18 year old girl
Priya!
<i>My lover has arrived</i>
