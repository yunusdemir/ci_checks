I've been down on my luck
for three years.
I've been waiting for a chance
to show them.
Not to prove my worth,
but to get back what I've lost!
Ah Jiht, calm down.
Don't call me "Ah Jiht" again.
Call me "Sir."
Sir...
I haven't been a Triad member
in a long time.
To be brothers...
Little Jiht,
you're not wrong.
We've just taken different paths.
You took the right path.
Let me introduce you. Western
District's Chief lnspector, Mr Wu Hoi.
This is lnspector Tsang.
Sit down, please.
There's a case we need
your involvement with.
I was wondering
if you would help us out.
Interpol intelligence suggests that,
an international counterfeit ring
has moved its HQ to Hong Kong.
It's a matter of saving face. I'd like
to solve this case before I retire.
Leave a good impression.
We've rounded up these notorious
counterfeiters already,
except for our prime suspect.
Lee Yan See, Lung Sei.
Fifteen years ago, he was the man.
He controlled the counterfeiting
business in Southeast Asia.
We suspect that Lung Sei
is still controlling the business.
Impossible.
He retired from the underworld
over ten years ago.
Are you sure?
Lung Sei is not that kind of person.
A man can change his looks,
but it's difficult to get away
from his criminal record.
You used to be one of them.
I want you to secretly investigate
Lung Sei.
I won't do it.
It's a matter of saving face.
Don't you want to contribute
to society?
I'm paying my debt now.
I think I can look society in the eye.
Mr Lung.
- Daddy, I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid.
- How are you?
- How are you?
Mr Lung.
- Ah Gou.
- Brother Sei.
- My daughter's really nervous.
- What's there to be nervous about?
What I taught you will definitely work.
20 years ago,
your mother and I danced it too.
We looked good from start to finish.
Sometimes one has to wait a while
for the applause,
but as long as you've tried your best,
someone will appreciate it.
- Sir, this way.
- No need.
- Do you know who Mr Lung Sei is?
- Why are you looking for him?
- He's my idol.
- He's your idol?
Yes. I really enjoy watching people
do this kind of dancing.
I saw him dance 20 years ago.
But not so many people knew
how to do ballroom dancing then.
So he looked really good.
I would really like to meet him.
Why don't I introduce you to him?
Daddy, someone wants to meet you.
He says you're his idol.
I heard him,
and it made me uncomfortable.
I do apologise. My name's Billy.
I didn't recognise you.
It doesn't matter. But are you sure
that I'm your idol from 20 years ago?
Actually, you haven't changed much.
- Daddy, the heel came off.
- That's all we need.
What shall I do?
Ah Tou! Get over here
and do something.
Take the shoe off.
Hey, what are you doing?
Come on.
If you show you can dance barefoot,
you'll get sympathy points.
Go on.
Please sit.
THE GROWTH PERlOD
FOR YOUNG CHlLDREN
I'm working on a case right now.
I can't tell anyone what I'm doing.
Not even you.
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
You take care of yourself.
Hello, Brother Wong.
Hello, Mr Wong.
Brother Sei,
Mr Wong wants to greet you.
Old Brother Lung.
Brother Wong.
Bravo.
Your daughter really does dance well.
No-one will wear shoes
to the dance competition next year.
LUNG FAMlLY SHIPYARD
Miss Lung.
My father's very chatty.
Don't talk too long with him.
Uncle!
- Daddy, Billy came to visit you.
- Did he?
- Billy, I'll leave you to chat.
- Okay.
Uncle, for you.
Smooth sailing for your business.
It hasn't been good recently,
but I see it improving.
Why don't I put it aside for you?
- Daddy, do you like the ship?
- I do.
This young man is quite considerate.
Billy says he wants a tour of the yard.
Yeah, I want to experience
new things.
I'm very happy
that you're a friend of Peggy's.
I'm grateful to you
as long as she's happy.
We haven't repaid the bank loan yet.
The shipyard
could be taken over at anytime.
How much do we have left to cover
the employees' severance pay?
Less than one third.
What are you listening to?
Walkman. Want to listen?
I heard someone applied to the courts
to get a closure order for our company.
The only solution
is to sell your stock.
Get some money together
to get through this dangerous period.
- Hey! Did you hear a word I said?
- Of course.
Old Brother Lung.
- What can I do for you?
- I just want to give you some cash.
Brother Sei.
I've already exchanged all my stock,
as collateral
against Mr Wong's notes of debt.
I've done my best for the company.
If you give up your stock to me,
then I'll withdraw the application
for a closure order immediately.
Do you think
that you're calling the shots?
When we were Triad members,
it was important to follow rules.
You respect me, and I'll respect you.
Gou Ying Pui may have been
temporarily confused,
and did something stupid without
consulting me beforehand.
You don't deserve my respect
or disrespect. Please leave.
You're not giving me much leeway,
are you?
I've never lost so much face
in all the years that I've been around.
Brother!
I haven't seen Little Jiht
in a long while.
He seems like another person.
He says he's on a special assignment.
Once he's done, we'll change
our names, identities...
We'll even move home.
- Did he say what it was?
- No.
He's become really strange.
He was even talking on the phone,
to a girl named Peggy
at midnight last night.
I'm so afraid that he'll leave me.
Why did you send
Little Jiht undercover?
He could be in grave danger.
Little Jiht has a mind of his own.
No-one can stop him.
Okay. I'll cooperate with you.
But transfer Little Jiht off this case
immediately.
I'll think about it. Sung Ji Hou,
I didn't force you. You volunteered.
We both have to be responsible
for the consequences.
When are you letting me out?
I'll arrange it.
Master.
How did you get out?
I escaped.
Uncle Sei, I have nowhere else to go.
I want to work under you again.
Go back and give yourself up.
If you've done something wrong,
walk in with your head held high
and leave with your head held high.
I've been retired from the underworld
for more than ten years.
I want to go straight,
but I'm being pressured
on all sides.
I want to prove my innocence,
but no-one believes me.
Ah Ho,
you should have another path
that you can follow.
- Thank you for coming.
- Policeman Chau.
- Why immigrate so soon?
- Don't talk about such things.
- Hi, Brother Chung.
- Hi. Excuse me.
Hello, Policeman Chau.
- Congratulations...
- Excuse me. Hey, Ah Chan.
When one isn't doing well, everyone
stares at you as if you're a monster.
Then you should stare back
as if they were the monsters.
You're right.
I've seen it all before, anyway.
Daddy said that out of all the boys
that I've known,
- you're the most cultured.
- Really?
He really likes the ship you gave him.
He asked me to thank you.
Can you wait a minute?
Jiht.
Brother Wong.
Elder Brother.
I'm called Billy.
Billy?
Why are you here?
I'm doing the same thing as you.
What did you find?
Come.
And you?
Wong Ji Gwok
and two other Triad members
are trying to take over
Lung Sei's shipyard.
But I don't know why.
Don't get involved further.
Let your big brother deal with it.
You're no match for them.
I've already started.
I'll see it through to the end.
I've gone down this path before.
I know how it will end.
I was too impulsive before.
Maybe after this
I'll understand you better.
You're still so stubborn.
- How did you hear about it?
- Mr Lung, a message for you.
VIP ROOM NOW - IMPORTANT.
OR YOU'LL REGRET IT.
When I throw away my cigarette,
fire your shot.
Brother Sei. Brother Sei!
Brother Sei.
Wong, I'm here now. What do you want?
Not much. Why are you so angry?
I just want your company
to pay its debt.
What kind of game are you playing?
Wong Ji Gwok, the way
you cheated me was despicable.
- You have no morals.
- Shut up!
- You don't have the right to talk!
- You...
Mr Wong, I'm responsible
for the actions of Gou Ying Pui.
- Leave the rest to the law courts!
- Law?!
The law is just a plaything for me.
The solution is simple.
Either sign the documents
or take a bullet, it's up to you.
- You don't have the guts.
- You don't believe me?
Lung Sei,
we both have dirty records.
Take a gamble.
I'll take the gamble.
- It has nothing to do with Brother Sei.
- Ah Gou.
- Deal with me.
- Don't be crazy.
- Let me kill him.
- Don't! He'll have you killed.
Policeman Chan,
there's about to be a murder.
- What? Really?
- Go and see. Really.
- You're merciless, so I'm ruthless.
- Put down the gun.
- Don't interfere, Brother Sei.
- Give it to me!
- I can be ruthless.
- Give it to me.
Brother Sei, let go!
Shoot him!
Brother Sei...
Put down the gun.
Help!
Ah Jiht, get Peggy out of here.
Protect her.
Daddy. Daddy.
Uncle Sei, let's go.
UNITED TAXI COMPANY
Uncle Sei, do you know
what you did just now?
You just killed someone.
I just hope you're innocent.
Obviously, he's been framed.
Uncle Ging,
whatever he says is useless now.
No-one will believe him.
Policemen and Triads
will be looking for him.
He needs to hide.
Then we need your help.
That would be against my principles...
...but they can be
swayed sometimes.
I still have contacts. I'll arrange
for him to escape by boat tonight.
Uncle Ging, thank you very much.
Uncle Sei, we'll arrange for you
to escape by boat tonight.
What about my daughter?
I'll take care of Peggy. Don't worry.
Do you have any friends living overseas?
Yes.
In New York.
No problem.
As long as you have friends.
Why didn't you take me home?
Your home isn't very safe.
This is Peggy.
This is my wife, Jackie.
Hey! Don't go!
- You lied to me.
- Calm down. Go to your room first.
- Let me go.
- Go.
Let go.
Don't be like this.
Sit.
I did lie to you,
but I wouldn't harm you.
I'm a policeman.
We suspect your father
is involved in illegal activities.
That's why I got close to you.
You used me!
Believe me,
it'd be safer for you
if you stayed here for now.
You'd better have a good explanation.
What assignment are you on?
Speak up.
Thank you.
Go. Don't worry.
We must send Peggy to America
and reunite her with Lung Sei.
Then what about you?
I'll think of some way to enter
their organisation.
They won't trust you easily.
I still have to try.
There's something strange
about Gou Ying Pui. Be careful.
- You be careful too.
- I will.
I DON'T WANT TO
DESTROY YOUR MARRlAGE.
I'M GOlNG HOME.
PLEASE DON'T COME AFTER ME.
You really don't know
where your father is?
I don't know.
- Did any friends say where he was?
- No.
Elder Brother... Peggy is dead.
There's a lot of memories
to reminisce over,
all about the heroics you did
while growing up.
I wrote a lot of heroic stories.
Uncle Chan, there wasn't much
to write about.
That's not true. The world we live in
isn't very humane anymore.
You guys were so good to each other.
That was something rare.
There aren't many
like Mark anymore.
Who's this?
He really looks like Mark.
He's called Ken,
his identical twin brother.
He was really fierce.
He used to be called
the "Little King of Diamond Hill".
Everyone would be afraid
at the mere mention of his name.
Later, he changed.
He liked travelling all over the world.
He went off to America
when he was 15 years old.
He worked his way
from the West Coast to the East.
He gritted his teeth and got stuck in.
Even Westerners were in awe of him.
That's why I say he has guts.
I'm Sung Ji Hou, calling frrom
Hong Kong. I'm looking fror Ken.
Okay, please wait a moment.
Brother Ging will scold you
if he sees you dressed like this.
- Whatever.
- Go and sit at the back.
Brother Ken.
Table 10?
There's a call from Hong Kong from
Sung Ji Hou. Do you want to take it?
Could you tell him
I can't talk right now?
Ask if he can wait a bit.
Those two white guys said
the rice dishes were salty.
They want to change them.
I'll change them.
Take this away first.
Ah Geung, I found a lawyer
to deal with immigration issues.
You'll soon be able to apply
for your family.
Thank you so much, Brother Ging.
Don't mention it.
Don't add so much salt
to the fried rice.
- The Westerners are causing a fuss.
- It won't happen again.
I'm careless because I'm scared
the INS officers will show up.
It won't happen again.
This is cool.
- What are you doing?
- Brother Ging! Brother Ging!
Are you freezing? Blind?
Serves you right. I told you
you'd get told off by Brother Ging.
No, Brother Mark's so cool,
Sun just wanted to copy him.
- You two.
- We're not blind.
We wanted to impress you,
but you won't take us in.
Look at how you're dressed.
Like fools.
Take off the jackets
and come have some soup.
- Hooray.
- Come on.
- Ah Geung, two more dishes of rice.
- Again?
Just do it.
Damned whites.
Ging, we can get reinforcements.
Here it is.
Something wrong with the fried rice?
- It tastes good.
- Brother Ging, you...
What are you doing?
Stop! Stop! It's illegal!
Eat, you asshole!
Eat, you asshole.
Are you going to eat it or not?
I'll blow your head away.
Eat. Eat. Eat. Come on.
When we parted 15 years ago,
you said I could look you up
if I was in trouble.
I can't believe
you have come to find me.
Brother Sei.
Ah Sum.
When I was a thief,
killing people seemed really easy.
Now that I have to save people,
it's very difficult.
But I'm certain there's always a way
to be good if one is determined.
You naughty girl.
Wash your hands first.
It's impossible to wash off the tattoos
I've had for more than 10 years.
A lot of ordinary churchgoers who see
them are afraid to come to church.
Hello?
Hello?
- Brother!
- Brother Sei!
Good. Where are you?
I'm in New York.
How did it go?
Everything will become clear soon.
I'm gathering evidence.
How is my daughter?
She really misses you.
I'll arrange for her to see you.
Please arrange for her to come over
as soon as possible.
As soon as possible.
Tell me the address. Okay...
Brother Sei, don't worry.
I'll deal with it. You take care.
He's in New York.
God bless him.
The matter is decided, then.
Okay, let's talk business.
How much counterfeit money do you want?
I need 60 million in counterfeit money
for Australia and South America.
How do you plan to deliver it to us?
We have ships.
Good. That's a relief.
How's this? We follow the agreed
price of $38 to buy $100 worth.
Hey, Ah Sum. I'm going to be able
to see my daughter soon.
That's good.
I told you
that you didn't have to worry.
- I'll give you some.
- Okay.
It's really good.
Ah Sum!
Save me!
Uncle Sei!
Uncle Sei!
Uncle Sei!
Uncle Sei!
Uncle Sei, we're home now.
Come on.
Uncle Sei! Dinner!
Uncle Sei!
I don't think you've had such a good
meal since arriving in America.
Here! Sausage. It's not poisoned.
Chicken wing?
Queen.
- Hey, it's diamonds.
- What?
- Do you have any?
- None.
Mr Gou,
there's a Mr Sung here for you.
I would like to see Mr Gou Ying Pui.
Brother Hou?
Brother Hou, when did you get out?
How unexpected.
Brother Hou. So nice to see you.
This is Brother Hou, who killed
the traitor Ah Sing in one shot.
- It's now common knowledge.
- I see...
- Let me introduce you.
- This is Mr Gou.
- Mr Gou.
- What can I do for you, Brother Hou?
I used to work under Lung Sei.
I am the man I am today
because he thought well of me.
Now that I've escaped,
and I am looking for him,
he screws up badly
and has to go into hiding.
I guess I'm unlucky.
I've lost my back-up plan
for making a fortune.
Why have you come to me
if you want to make a fortune?
I want to work under you, Mr Gou.
You're mistaken.
We do legitimate business.
Your background,
my circumstances... you understand.
If I hadn't researched
your background,
would I have dared to look you up?
Brother Hou, don't put it like that.
Everyone makes a bit on the side.
If you're interested,
have a chat with Mr Gou.
Mr Gou, if there's a chance for me
to get inovlved, I'll do what you say.
Okay, that's a deal.
Give me some time to think about it.
We need to trust each other.
- Mr Gou, let's talk some more.
- Okay.
Mrs Sung,
why don't you ask your husband
to decide on a name for the baby?
Mrs Cheung, please come in.
Hello! How are things?
Hello!
Long time no see, good friend.
How are things?
Get out of here!
How careless.
Very good.
Brother, what do you do?
What do I do?
You didn't even thank me.
Let's talk business.
- Talk business?
- Yep.
Okay.
It doesn't do you any good not to eat.
I won't force you to eat because
you're not a child.
You go ahead and feed yourself.
Eat something, Uncle Sei.
Eat!
In this world, whether
you're a couple or just friends,
the only thing to fear
is not being able to help.
If you think there's no-one good enough
in this world who can help you,
why don't you try helping yourself?
If you want to be sick,
I'll be sick with you.
If you want to give up,
we can give up together.
If you want to starve to death,
we'll starve together.
You piece of shit!
Yes, it's really sweet.
Eat some.
Eat some, eat some.
It's delicious!
- What?
- I'm not going to tell you.
I don't think that's what was said.
- Let's look for Brother Ging!
- OK, let's go!
Marco, gather the gang.
- Quickly, call everyone.
- Call Fei and the others.
- Okay, I got it.
- Can you call more people?
- Brother Ging.
- This has nothing to do with you.
If you can do things for us,
we can do things for you, too.
Yeah.
It's already making me uncomfortable
that you're in this state. Go home!
I only have one life. I'm not afraid!
- Brother Fai.
- Brother Ging.
Brother Ging.
- Thank you.
- Brother Ging, why?
Good brother.
Uncle Sei!
We're going, Uncle Sei!
- Brother Ging!
- Brother Ging!
Brother Ging!
- Don't follow us.
- Brother Ging, let us help you.
- You've finally thought it through.
- Yes. I have.
One person can't make all the money.
Why not be open to others?
I really would like to work with you.
- Do you trust me now?
- I still feel uncertain.
Before we work together we should
get to know each other better.
We should test each other's
trustworthiness.
How?
I want you to get rid of someone.
This person is my secret enemy.
He said he's one of us.
We've found out that
he's an undercover policeman.
Kill him later.
Please excuse us, brother.
Oh, little Billy.
If you wanted extra cash,
you could have said something to me.
Actually,
I've always thought well of you.
Mr Gou, you have a different
status now. It's difficult to chat.
- Let's just do the exchange.
- Okay.
Jo Jong.
Billy, I found out that
you're an undercover policeman.
You want to destroy me?
Undercover policeman?
I would have arrested you already!
Would I let you bastards
treat me like this?
If you don't believe me,
make your move.
Do what he wishes then.
Okay, if you want to play games,
I'll play!
Blow me away or else
I'll report you to the police!
Jo Jong.
Let me do it!
Fire one more time...
or else he won't believe you.
Shoot.
Sung Ji Hou! Deal with him!
Brother...
he only has to trust one...
out of us two brothers.
Shoot.
Shoot!
Actually, we didn't look into this kid.
But we just wanted to test you.
Welcome to our firm.
Thank you.
Little Jiht!
Little Jiht!
Little Jiht!
Little Jiht!
I'm your older brother.
- Where's the emergency room?
- Over there!
Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
- Let's operate, quickly!
- Yes.
- Let's go in! Quick!
- Push!
Quick!
- Please, quickly!
- Sir, you can't come in.
Elder Brother!
- How's Ah Jiht?
- He's injured.
Doctors are saving his life.
He's going to be all right.
Fortunately the bullet didn't stay
in his stomach. Don't worry.
What's her name?
What's her name?
Your daughter's already dead.
She's dead.
Wake up, will you?
Wake up, will you?!
Is this how you want to spend
the rest of your life?
Don't torture yourself anymore.
If anyone saw you like this,
they'd be very sad.
The old Uncle Sei...
was a giant among men.
He wasn't afraid of big shots.
Now, you're even afraid
to step out of the room...
Why can't you face reality?
Why?
It's better if you're dead!
Someone blew up what it took
more than 10 years to build.
I still don't have regrets.
I won't ask for anyone's pity either.
Not like you.
Waiting to die,
for someone to do you in.
I can still change things.
If you don't admit that you're
a failure, then you can hit back at me.
In this world, no-one can be forced
to do something!
Get out!
There's only one way out!
I want you to help me fight our way out.
If you don't help,
then we'll both die here.
It's not like in the movies,
where even the dead rise again!
I know that you can do it, come on!
Don't... don't force me!
Don't force me! Don't force me!
Don't force me!
Don't force me!
Peggy...
I'm here, don't be afraid.
Father is here.
He wants to see you.
Peggy...
Ah Ken!
Why is it so difficult
to be a good person?
This is not my home after all.
Some people try everything
to leave their home.
Some want to go back home.
Some...
...don't even have
a temporary shelter.
Homeland is still a better place.
Brother Ken!
Will you come back?
I'll come back to have soup.
Hey, you favoured him!
You kept so much of Mark's stuff.
Of course! He was so good to me.
For example, I kept this coat for you.
It's got 40 bullet holes.
It's to remind you to behave yourself!
To prevent you having
to crawl back here full of holes!
Uncle Sei!
I've been waiting day and night
for your return.
Ah Hou...
Look who's here.
- Mark?!
- It's Ken.
It's Ken!
PEGGY LUNG. BORN AUGUST 4, 1967.
DlED AUGUST 16, 1987.
I'm sorry... I couldn't protect Peggy.
I send flowers here every day.
Be strong.
This was the will of the heavens.
Uncle Sei.
Ah Jiht tried his best.
You have all had a rough time.
I don't care about anything any more.
Why are you staring?!
- You look like someone.
- The one who died?
Your older brother?
Don't talk about dead people
in a cemetery.
I'm Sou Ji Hou's younger brother,
Sung Ji Jiht. Greetings.
So it's little brother Jiht.
Don't call me that.
Just call me Ah Jiht.
- I'm Ah Ken.
- Okay, brother Ken.
We're both younger brothers,
just call me Ah Ken.
- What's wrong? Got hit?
- lnjury from work.
If you got hit, you got hit.
Injury from work!
You're as talkative as your brother.
And just as cocky.
- Ah Jiht,
- What?
Jackie's very worried.
Why don't you go home first?
Okay.
Hey, elder brother!
Why don't we let little Jiht join in?
He may have some
good intelligence for us.
He's right. It's better
to have an extra person helping out.
Whatever you say, Uncle Sei.
Let me think it through.
What are Gou Ying Pui
and the others using the shipyard for?
I suspect that they're involved
in counterfeiting,
and they're framing Uncle Sei.
They don't actually need to kill Uncle
Sei. Just driving him crazy is enough.
I'm going to burn down the shipyard.
My lifeblood cannot be destroyed
by someone else.
If it's destruction,
then I'll do it myself.
The most important thing is to get
evidence so you can clear your name.
Either we don't do anything,
or we make it big, right?
Brother, any clues?
A buyer from New York
came to Hong Kong recently.
In the next few days, there'll be
a big transaction with Gou Ying Pui.
Once we find out where their base is,
we'll crush them.
- Ah Ken.
- Yes?
Thank you, Uncle Sei.
It's really sweet.
Catch.
Uncle... a token of my respect.
I don't eat oranges.
Here.
What?
A shooting star.
It probably was a firefly.
The police say a shooting star
means someone will die soon.
Where's the fun in knowing
you'll die early?
The first time I met you
was in a cemetery.
The first time we go out, I see
a shooting star. That's a bad omen.
What's the connection?
Are you scared?
I'm not scared. I'm very scared.
I'm afraid that I'll die
before this case is closed.
Do you still have
a lot of things to take care of?
It's better to be more light-hearted.
I leave with a light heart
and I come back with a light heart.
With a swoosh of his clothes,
but bringing hidden talents.
Who's that?
I think he may be the printer.
Go to the shipyard
and make them work overtime.
Tomorrow I'll pick up the merchandise.
- Okay, okay.
- Ah Hou, you go too.
- It's almost time.
- Let's go.
Big brother is here.
Big brother! Big brother!
Work faster!
Quick! Quick!
Do you know what we'll earn
when we complete this transaction?
We could easily afford to buy up
a couple of luxurious hostess clubs.
Hey!
How dare you!
Pinching from us?
No!
What are you looking at? Work!
Keep an eye on them!
It's obvious the counterfeiting
base is at the shipyard.
Gou Ying Pui is the mastermind
behind it all.
Then we should contact the police
so we can clear Uncle Sei's name.
- That's right.
- It isn't that simple!
I have a feeling that something's wrong.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Why don't you believe me?
It's just that...
Gou Ying Pui, this is Lung Sei.
I'm back.
Brother Sei! How's your health?
Good.
Kind of you to ask.
I have to talk to you.
Look, I don't want you involved
in this anymore.
- But l...
- I don't want you to get hurt again.
- Jackie's gone into hospital.
- Really?
She's staying in Room 704.
You know that she really needs
someone with her at this time.
It's Gou Ying Pui.
Let's go.
Brother Ging, what did you find?
There's no-one here.
We've fallen for a trap.
That's bad.
Mr Gou, we've already
contacted the police.
Did you think I believed Sung Ji Hou?
I dealt with him by using a few
scapegoats. It won't get back to us.
- Let's go quickly!
- Let's go!
The back door. The police are here.
Catch Lung Sei alive!
Come on, quick! Get in the car!
- You first!
- Let's go together!
Just get in! Look after Uncle Sei!
- What's happening?
- Let's see what's going on.
Follow me. Follow me.
This way. Follow me.
What's going on?
Get in the car!
Here.
- You really got hit this time.
- Are you scared?
I'm not scared. I'm very scared.
Then you really have to drive faster.
Turns out that Gou's place
is the counterfeit base.
I've finally done it.
Even if you've cracked the case,
there'll be more crime.
But someone has to do it.
Correct.
And you're the only one doing it.
Little Jiht! Little Jiht!
Stop the car. I need to make a call.
We're almost at the hospital.
We're almost at the hospital.
We're not going to make it.
Room 704, please.
Hi, Brother Hou. This is Ah Ken.
Nothing's wrong. He's next to me.
Could you ask Jackie
to come to the phone?
Hello, Jackie? Wait a moment.
Wife, is it a son or daughter?
- It's a daughter.
- Okay.
Daughter.
- How many pounds?
- 6lbs, 3oz. She's really pretty.
6lbs, 3oz. Not too skinny, right?
When Mark and I were born,
didn't even weigh 6lbs put together.
Does she look more like you or me?
She looks like me,
but she has your eyes.
My wife says
our daughter's really pretty.
That her eyes look like mine.
I can see that from the father's face.
Bring her to the phone,
so that I can speak to her.
You're being silly.
She can't talk yet.
She only knows how to cry.
Even if it's just crying,
I want to listen to it.
Hello? Hello? Hello?
Why aren't you talking?
Oh, I was just too happy.
Ir you want to see her that much,
then hurry back.
I'm on my way.
Hello? Hello?
Ah Jiht, we haven't
decided on a name yet.
Little Jiht, you still need to decide
on a name for your daughter.
Sung... Houh Yihn.
It's meaningless asking me
what happened today
No use looking into it
Don't ask about the meaning
With words of regret
Without words of regret
How to judge?
Not thinking
Not remembering, not knowing
It's meaningless to ask me
about my whole life
Who wants to talk about
unhappy past events
With feeling
Without feeling
Don't ask me
Not comprehending, not pursuing
Not explaining... the meaning
No tears...
-...no pain...
- Sir, be careful.
- No longer...
- Ah Jiht!
-...shall I suffer frrom my fears?
- Jiht, you...
I run with all my will and heart
towards those future days
I will accompany you
to seek good memories
I make this promise to you
It's meaningless to ask me
about sad things
It's useless to think
that it's not in the past
These things, sometimes
one can't regret
Passing through the middle part
one won't know
One won't know
It's meaningless to ask me
about my whole lifre
Who wants to talk about
unhappy past events
With feeling
Without feeling
Don't ask me
Not satisfied, don't pursue
Don't explain...
-...the meaning
- Uncle Ging, go home.
I can help.
No tears, no pain...
I'll prepare a boat
for you to escape on.
No need.
No longer
shall I suffer frrom my fears
I run with all my will and heart
towards those future days
I will accompany
you to seek good memories
I make this promise to you
It's meaningless to ask me
about sad things
Brother Sung fell from here.
It's useless to think
that it's not in the past...
Good working with you.
Wow! Wow!
Wow! Uncle Ging
must have made a mistake.
The grenades are so powerful.
I'd better watch myself this time.
You can't deal with this.
Let the others deal with them.
What's the matter? You want to run away?
These are for you.
Everybody,
kill one and you get 100,000.
100,000? I'll do it. Let's go.
Let's go, quick!
Brother!
What kind of explosives are these?
They're so powerful.
I have other ones.
Do you want to try them out?
- I can get some for you later.
- Get down!
Gou Ying Pui!
How are you? You okay?
- Give me a gun! Give me a gun!
- Here.
Wait!
Get down!
Uncle Ging!
Uncle!
Gou Ying Pui!
Brother Sei! Are you okay?
Gou Ying Pui!
Drop the gun.
You are too earnest.
Do you really think that in this world,
good people always get rewarded?
You think that bad people
will be rewarded?
Uncle Sei! Are you okay?
I didn't need you two to save me.
Yes. We were wrong.
Uncle Sei, we're dying.
Can we go now?
- Fine, let's go.
- Okay.
Uncle Ging... leave first.
Go!
Drop your guns.
Chief lnspector Wu,
you shouldn't retire yet.
There's lots more for you to do.
Brother Ken, we really miss you.
How are you?
We're taking good care
or the restaurant.
There's even more customers
than befrore.
When you get back,
you'll be really happy.
After you left...
