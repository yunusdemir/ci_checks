The puffballs!
When the puffballs come,
cold winter's almost gone.
When the puffballs soar,
then winter's no more.
I'll get the best one.
- Ciccio, let's go to the seashore.
- Look at that one up there.
In our town puffballs
and spring arrive together.
These are puffballs that drift around.
They go here and they go there.
Soaring over the cemetery,
where all rest in peace.
Soaring over the beachfront
and over the Germans...
...who do not feel the cold.
Drifting, drifting.
Swirling.
Swirling, swirling.
Drifting, drifting, drifting!
I'm the last of 14 children.
When I was born...
...my father had had enough,
so he called me "Definitivo."
If he'd had enough sooner,
there'd be one less chatterbox.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
See you in the square.
I've come for my sister.
Is it too early?
Your sister's here.
Oh, Fiorella! I'm all done here.
Come in.
If its because of that thing,
I better calm down, you beast!
This year the bonfire is 4 feet taller
than last year.
Those are my shoes!
Going to the bonfire tonight?
What are you playing?
I've composed a brand new tune.
Let me give you a little taste.
Its unique. It has no rivals.
- Brava, Gradisca.
- Go! Go!
Now, Dad, we'll watch them light
the bonfire, then I'll take you home.
The doctor says you must
go to bed early.
Tell the doctor he's an asshole.
I'll go to bed when I please!
You'll end up in the hospital,
and this time I'll leave you there.
Blockheads! Numskulls!
Come and buy from Biscein.
Let me through!
Thats my place!
You creeps!
Let me through!
Listen to this one!
A father can take care of 100 kids,
but 100 kids...
...can't take care of one father.
Thats the truth.
- I want to set off a firecracker.
- You stay here!
Hey, Giudizio, catch!
I can, I order and I want!
Long live Giudizio!
Volpina, have you made love today?
Say, how many did you service?
I bet you would even dip a cock
in your morning coffee!
Here she is!
You're the greatest, Gradisca.
Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!
Lets go over there.
Damn you!
Ronald Coleman, we're over here!
Giudizio, take this chair too.
Burn this one too!
Put it on top.
Put the old witch in it.
You scoundrel, I'll stuff that chair
down your throat. Take it home now!
The old witch!
The old witch is here.
Let me wed her before you burn her!
- What are you looking at, dummy?
- I'm not looking. Actually...
Stop it!
Don't look, otherwise
you'll get too excited!
Firecrackers!
Bring the firecrackers!
Lets light the bonfire
and burn the old...
Lets burn the old witch!
Light the bonfire!
And with this fire, witch so old,
you take with you the freezing cold.
Here's spring!
- But I don't have matches.
- Your beloved does, sweetheart.
Here you go.
Lets burn the old witch!
Long live Giudizio!
I can, I order and I want!
- Where's the ladder?
- Do you want the ladder?
Really? Take it!
Give it to me.
- I'm burning here!
- Take it.
Give me the ladder!
The ladder!
In America, I saw bonfires
350 feet high.
- When were you ever there?
- My parents are American.
I'll break your legs!
You should hear what my dad
can do with his ass!
Hurray for spring!
It gives me a funny feeling.
How about you?
Yes, but its winter thats
dying and now spring is here!
I can feel spring
all over me already!
Our respects, count.
Our respects, sister.
- Our respects, little countess.
- Thank you.
Drink a little, itll do you good!
Even your aunt's drinking. Look!
No!
Why? No, no, no!
Good old Lallo!
No one would know you're 60.
Look at that!
Your brother really is an asshole!
He's a youngster!
Now see the Malaysian tiger leap!
- You almost landed on the roof!
- You'll get it later!
- Look at his shoe.
- The heel's come off.
- Now you'll do without one!
- Where is that other useless ass gone?
Ciccio, throw the big bang
on the fire!
What the hell are you doing? Go to bed!
I'll put you in boarding school!
Here's Scureza, the fart of Corpolo!
Bravo, Scureza! Bravo!
Scureza of Corpolo!
I will kick your ass
till your ass gets raw!
The origins of this town are lost
in the mist of time.
In the municipal muzeum,
there are stone implements...
- All the best.
- My respects.
...that date back to prehistoric times.
I, myself, have found
some graffiti of great age...
...in the caves
of Count Lovignano's estate.
Be that as it may, the first
certain date is 268 B. C...
...when this became a Roman colony
and the start of the Emilian Way.
Mr. Lawyer!
This too is characteristic
of the spirit of these people...
...who have Roman and Celtic blood
in their veins.
Theirs is an exuberant, generous,
tenacious nature.
From the divine poet Dante
to Pascoli, D'annunzio...
...a great number of brilliant minds
have lauded this land...
...while innumerable are its sons
who have contributed greatly...
...to the arts, science, religion
and politics...
Who are you? You're so clever
but too gutless to show yourself.
Come out and show yourself!
I'll explain everything face to face.
- Mr. Lawyer!
- Yes, yes.
Gentlemen!
Quiet!
- Shall we all take our places?
- Lf you insist, headmaster.
But I never come out well
in photographs.
You boys at the back,
get on the bench!
- Now what, De Santis?
- It wasn't me, sir!
Aldina!
Belaria, it looks just like you.
- What's happening?
- Gigliozzi! Be seated.
Hold it like that, please.
Hold it like that. There you go.
Done!
- What is this?
- A stone.
- Yes, but what is it?
- I know, it's for a slingshot.
Is it an elephant's testicle?
I'll tell you. It's a pendulum.
You certainly all know
a pendulum clock.
- And how does it go?
- Tick, tock...
Where did Tiberius retire to when he
gave up leadership of the Empire?
To Capri. Yes.
- The murder of Agrippina?
- 69 A.D.
Why have you given me a bad mark?
Wasn't it 69?
- It was 59 A.D.
- Are you sure?
What do you mean?
It was 59 A.D.!
Holy cow! I knew it was!
You'll drive me crazy!
Get back to your seat!
What have I done?
Why couldn't it have been 69?
"There will come the day
when a renewed Italy...
...will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf...
...and not defend her soil
for others with their weapons..."
- universal, being spirit incarnate
in the state...
...and cannot but enter into
the true nature of the church.
This reconciliation between state
and church occurred through...
...a demiurge, which brought order
to members of state and church...
...demanding iron discipline
and the right to intervene...
...in all aspects of individual life.
He is Goďs chosen Son...
...because he has the same power
as the Father.
Then there is the Holy Spirit
to be placed on the same level...
...as the Father and the Son.
Is that clear?
This is why God is one,
and also a Trinity.
- Today, I'll speak of the great Giotto.
- Whose balls exploded in a grotto!
Do you know, boys and giris...
...why Giotto is so important
in Italian painting?
I will tell you.
Because he invented perspective.
Perspective.
Miss, can I leave the room?
Bobo has let a real stinker!
What do you mean?
You're nuts. It's not true.
I never fart.
- You do. You do.
- I do not!
Alboin...
...signed the peace.
Gigliozzi! Get out!
Here you go. It's not difficult.
Solve it.
Gordimi.
Why have you stopped?
You were doing fine.
What did you want to do?
- Give me a clue.
- Pass it to me.
Just think a moment.
9X plus the square root of 3K.
But it's so obvious!
Move over. What's this scribbling?
What have you done?
Let's go over it together.
What is written here?
What is this written here?
I mean, you must know how to read!
- But I...
- Be quiet!
9X plus the square root of 3K...
Here's the solution.
1 X equals 140.
2X equals 3/5 of the total,
less the difference.
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
What have you done?
Have you gone nuts?
Janitor! Janitor!
- Greek is beautiful, isn't it?
- You bet!
- It's so musical, don't you think?
- Oh, yeah!
Emarpszamen! Repeat after me.
- Silence! Be quiet, kids.
- I can't do it.
- Try again.
- Could you be so kind...
- Tell me, dear.
- Could I hear it again, please?
Certainly, certainly.
Listen. Emarpszamen.
Careful with the tongue.
It must go here
against the palate...
...then you spit it out.
Try it.
- Silence.
- I just can't do it.
Okay. Come on, try it again.
Come on now. Greek is so difficult.
How did you put your tongue?
Not that way, between your teeth.
- Like this?
- You almost got it.
That's right.
- Go back to your seat, damn it!
- I nearly got it that time.
- Who's that?
- It's Ciccio.
Hey, it's Ciccio!
- Leave me the smoke.
- Just one drag.
Is it true that Aldina
ripped up your poem?
I've written another one!
What a kind, gentle maiden
Art thou, beautiful Aldina
You radiate so bright
My heart beats with all its might
- It's nice and warm outside.
- I prefer Aldina's mother.
I wonder who's on the beach
this morning.
Fu Manchu!
Volpina!
Volpina!
Come here!
What are you doing here?
- What do you want?
- I've lost my pussycat.
Oh, yeah?
There are no cats here.
Be good, go home.
It's hot, isn't it?
Aren't you all hot?
What an odd girl this one is.
Come on now, go home.
There are no cats here.
Boss, brick-head has written
another poem.
When do you write
all these poems?
Brick-head, let's hear this poem.
Okay, let's hear it.
- What's its title?
- "Bricks."
- Oh, nice!
- My grandfather laid bricks
My father laid bricks
And I lay bricks too
But I still don 't see my house, do you?
- Bravo!
- Way to go!
Right. Why not?
I get what you're saying.
It's quite right. But I too
was once a poor man...
...and I have gradually worked my way
up to master builder.
You can't get everything at once!
You have to be patient,
you have to work.
- By working, one can. You must work.
- Aren't we working?
That's enough!
- No drinking before the soup.
- But I'm thirsty!
- You can't drink!
- Where have you read that?
It blows up the stomach.
I read it in the Sunday paper.
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- There's a spoon missing.
- Is it hot, Lallino?
- A little.
- I want a lot, Mom.
- You'll get your share.
Would you like some more, Lallo?
There's some left, you know.
- Is there enough salt?
- Yes, Grandpa.
- Gina, give him a little.
- He's already eaten.
My father's father was known
as "Big Meat."
He lived to be 107
and he was still doing it!
- Yeah, and?
- And then...
...when I was little, he taught me
you have to eat at 11 in the morning...
...before the sun burns your head,
and at 4 in the afternoon.
Otherwise it's all poison that ends up
here and gets into your blood.
- Aren't you eating?
- No!
What have you done to your mother?
Huh?
- Nothing!
- Nothing, Dad.
They've done nothing.
Bloody hell!
Get up at 4 in the morning...
...slave away all day like a mule.
Then come home to eat some bread
and see a bunch of long faces!
Now you won't have to
see them anymore!
Ma'am, it's time to take
the boiler off.
Yes.
- It's so heavy!
- What's the matter?
Nothing!
- Eat something, then.
- I don't want to!
- Why not?
- Because I just don't!
- Shut that door. It's cold.
- Yes, yes.
I'm still convalescent.
- Who can it be at this hour?
- How would I know?
- Shall I see who it is?
- Yes, you go.
What do you think my bottom is,
holy water?
Chicken always gets stuck
between my teeth.
- Can I have some more, Dad?
- Stop right there!
- It's just a wing.
- I'll give it to you!
Tell me, Miranda,
have you put mint in it?
No, not mint! Sage!
But you realized there was
something different, didn't you?
Lallino has a good palate.
Gina! Who the hell is it?
- So?
- Mr. Biondi is here.
- I was eating!
- Isn't he the bishop's cousin?
- I want it. I want it.
- Hey! What are you, bottomless pits?!
Anyone would think I never fed you!
Uncle, look!
- Lf your dad sees you...
- Big deal!
Uncle, do that nice trick for us.
Come on, just once.
Look, Titta!
You're good!
- It's difficult, isn't it?
- Well, you know...
Good wine, this Sangiovese.
- Good, huh?
- Yep!
- Where were you last night?
- Me?
- At the cinema.
- What was on?
Uncle, the Americans were trying
to get into Comanche territory...
...and they built a bridge
for the railway, but the Indians...
...shot arrows at them from above.
It was a massacre, Dad!
What were you up to,
you little criminal?!
What's happened now?
- I didn't do anything!
- Stop!
Aurelio, leave him alone!
Come here!
I'll put you in the hospital if I catch you!
- Aurelio, people are watching.
- Morning.
Starting tomorrow, no more school,
no more allowance.
He can start working with me!
- But you'll have to pay me!
- With a hammer in the face!
You have to tell me
who fathered this piece of shit!
At his age, I'd been working
three years!
Yes, I know. And gave
all the money to Grandma.
- You...
- Enough now!
- Come and eat, you two!
- Yes.
Good morning.
Everyone in town laughs at us,
even the roosters.
- In my own home, I'll do as I please!
- Listen to God Almighty!
Give me your brother's plate.
Give it to me!
- Put that plate down.
- What has he done?
I'll show you what he's done.
What has he done?
What has he done?
- Tell me or I'll wring your neck!
- I don't know, Mom!
What do you mean,
you don't know?
This is Mr. Biondi's hat.
He was at the cinema last night.
Just smell it.
Know who did that?
That brat of a son of yours.
He pissed over the rail of the balcony,
right on Biondi's head.
That cost me three bills!
I'm sure it was those delinquents
he hangs around with!
Damn it! Always the same story!
You've got to stop taking his side.
He's getting worse and worse!
They're a pair of little criminals!
You've brought them up all wrong!
Okay, you do it, then!
Let's see how well you do!
I can't stand it anymore!
I'm going crazy! I'm going mad!
- I'll kill the lot of you!
- Yeah, sure.
I'll put strychnine in your soup!
That's what I'll do
one of these days!
- You won't put strychnine in the soup.
- Oh, yes, I will!
One, two, three.
Oh, yeah?
But I'll kill myself first!
- Right now!
- Good!
This time I will!
No! I'll kill myself first!
Uncle, look at Dad!
Why does everything happen to me?
What have I done?
Goddamn it all!
- Have you hurt yourself?
- What are you doing on the floor?
- Hey, man. Avoid this one if you can.
- Not the hat!
Good evening, headmaster.
- There's Gradisca!
- Where?
Over there!
If you give the archbishop
permissión...
...to sell holy pictures
in the schools...
...I'm sure we can settle the matter
between us.
When are you showing The Vale
Of Love with Gary Cooper?
- Next week, my dear.
- Thank you very much.
When can your little prince
come to bed with you?
I'll wash your mouth out with soap!
You don't think so?
Such behavior!
Get lost, Giudizio!
It was really lovely,
and I had a good cry!
Romanesque, 13th century,
perfect condition.
Mullion window...
Excuse me. I'll continue later.
Lallo, read the telegram
White Feather got from Stockholm.
"Come immediately. I cannot live
without you. Inge."
Is she the bucktoothed one
from last summer?
Are you going?
I'll be cold up there now!
If I put a bullet between their eyes,
they'd call me a murderer!
I'd throw them all in quicklime!
Get the hell out of here!
- What about my mother?
- I couldn't leave Mom for buckteeth.
Look at Madam's new giris.
Just look!
See that big one with the hat?
A dead man dancing!
Can I ride with you?
Here I am!
I have the sacred right
of a place in the sun...
He was a handsome man,
a lot like Wallace Beery.
Do you remember? With that beard,
he looked like a French duke.
That's a great load!
Scureza!
Good night, King Vittorio.
Good night everybody!
This is the Victory Monument
we used to visit every day.
I dreamt about it at night too.
- I'm going, Mom.
- Make a good confessión.
If you've had a drink,
you can't receive Communion.
You can drink, but you can't eat.
You can't drink either.
And tell him you're a delinquent.
- That you make your parents angry.
- Yes.
- That you answer back.
- Yes.
And that you curse.
Everything, understand?
- Bye, Mom.
- Everything!
Who's the first?
- When did you last confess?
- Christmas.
- Shame on you. Do you go to Mass?
- Not when I've got the mumps.
- Do you honor your parents?
- Oh, yes.
Not like that! White flowers
on one side, yellow on the other.
It's not the same thing.
It's all a matter of aesthetics.
I understand.
Well, do you honor your parents?
Oh, yes, but they don't honor me.
They beat me.
You must annoy them.
Do you tell lies?
- I have to.
- Do you covet what belongs to others?
The small flowers
in the small vases.
What do you covet?
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat
with a lot of metal buckles...
...like the one the detective has in
the William Powell-Myrna Loy films.
Do you commit impure acts?
Do you touch yourself?
Do you know Saint Louis cries
when you touch yourself?
Go ahead, cry.
I'm not going to say whether I do...
...because you'll only tell my dad.
Don 't say you don 't touch yourself.
How can you not touch yourself
when you see the tobacconist...
...as stacked as she is,
when she says:
Export brand?
And the math teacher who looks
just like a lion?
Holy Mother of God.
How can you not touch yourself
when she looks at you that way?
What do you think we come to see
on St. Anthony's day...
...when there's the blessing
of the animals, the sheep 's butts?
Olindo! I have a flat tire!
Would you pass me the pump?
There. See how he's looking at me?
How can I tell him about Volpina...
...and that time when she asked me
to fix her bike tires.
Did you know people kissed that way,
with tongues going in and out?
I ask the questions, not you.
Go on.
Then, there's Gradisca.
Last summer...
...I saw her going into the cinema.
Because... You see...
...I'm crazy about Gradisca.
I want a wife like her.
She was alone.
She was there, in front of me.
I changed seats.
I changed seats again...
...then again.
And finally...
Looking for something?
I sat there like an asshole.
I wanted to jump in the harbor.
But Father Balosa
can 't understand such things.
So since I had to
tell him something...
...I would say that I touched
myself once, just a little...
...and that I repented immediately.
He was happy with that.
He gave me three Our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glorias and that was it.
Three Our Fathers, Hail Marys
and Glorias.
Do you touch yourself?
Look at those rings under your eyes!
Yes, you do.
You touch yourself.
Yes, just once in the garage.
Enough!
- Why?
- Always touching me.
- Jean Harlow!
- Gradisca!
The tobacconist's tits!
- The girl at the circus!
- Which one?
- The one in the fishnet!
- Aldina!
No. Aldina's mine!
I'll smash your face!
- Platoons, stand at attention!
- Platoon...
...attention!
- Platoon, attention!
- Platoon, attention!
There he is! There he is!
Comrades!
Salute the duce!
We hail the duce with grateful
hearts and the Fascist salute!
The greeting of Imperial Rome...
...which shows us...
...the path of destiny to be followed
by Fascist Italy.
Let me touch him!
I want to touch him!
Long live the duce!
Wonderful duce!
Ninety-nine percent of the population
carry the party card.
We have 1200 Young Fascists,
3000 Young Italian Giris...
...and 4000 Sons of the She-Wolf.
- We're a single Fascist heart...
...but the work on the sea front
needs hurrying up.
This marvelous enthusiasm makes us
young but so ancient at the same time.
Young because fascism
has rejuvenated our blood...
...with shining ideals that are
very ancient.
All I can say is,
Mussolini's got balls this big!
Today, April 21, we celebrate
the birth of Rome, the eternal city.
What does that mean? It means
we must respect the monuments...
...the ruins that Rome has left us.
That is what I am doing,
despite being harassed at night.
Why don't we see
on this glorious, sun-filled day...
...the Italian sun, to which
no one can apply sanctions...
...is a divine sign that the heavens
are on our side!
Miranda.
- Who locked the gate?
- I did!
- Why?
- You know why!
Come here, open it.
Listen to the noise they're making
in the square since this morning.
- Open up. I have things to do!
- You're staying at home!
Take this off! If I want to be a widow,
I'll kill you myself.
I'll strangle you with your neckerchief!
Think I'm scared of those
black-shirted lice?
Give me the key. Come on.
Give me the key! Miranda!
Goddamn it!
Why is it that every time there's
a demonstration with those assholes...
...I have to stay home!
It's unheard of!
One, two...
...three, four...
...five, six...
...seven, eight.
These youth are sturdy as rocks!
Yes, yes, sturdy as rocks!
One, two, three, four...
...five, six, seven.
Hail to the duce!
Hail to the duce! Hail to the duce!
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi...
...do you wish to marry
Young Italian, Aldina Cordini?
And you, Young Italian,
Aldina Cordini...
...do you wish to marry
Young Fascist, Ciccio Marconi?
Way to go, Ciccio! Long live Ciccio!
Comrades, they say bread and work...
...but wouldn't bread and a glass
of wine be better?
- A Fernet.
- A coffee!
- Fernet!
- A soft drink.
For our comrade, the federale!
Three cheers!
Difficult shot!
- Difficult shot!
- A difficult shot, Your Excellency!
I wouldn't like to go up against him!
- Who turned off the lights?
- Attilio, light a candle.
Light the candle.
There's a gramophone
playing up there.
There's a gramophone
playing up there.
- What the hell are you saying?
- There's a gramophone up there.
Silence!
That's the "Internazionale"!
- What is it?
- The hymn of subversives.
- Where is it? Where is it coming from?
- Where are you hiding?
It's incredible!
You coward! Coward!
Show yourself, coward!
We await your orders, sir!
Everyone is to go home!
Close the windows!
You there, close the window!
- Get inside!
- Go home!
What are you doing there?
Hurry, go home!
Hey! He's up there!
- Come on, let's go home.
- He's in the bell tower!
Beware! Beware!
Beware, we are Fascists
The terror of the communists
We are the members of the Fascist party
The cause we will follow until our death
And in a fight we'll always be our best
GOD MOTHERLAND FAMILY
You're free to go.
You can go home. You see?
The Fascists aren't all that bad.
We didn't even harm a single hair.
We almost offered you coffee as well.
Good night, sonny boy!
Bring him here.
Take your hat off.
I'm sorry, it's a habit, even at home...
Why don't you use
the Roman style of greeting?
I didn't know it was mandatory.
I don't know anything about politics.
Have a seat!
So you don't know anything
about politics!
Yet you have been heard to say:
"If Mussolini continues like this,
I really don't know."
What do you mean by
"I really don't know"?
Well...
...I never said anything like that.
I generally only talk about my work.
Perhaps I said I really don't know
about politics, how it works.
- Is that a threat?
- Certainly not!
- Lack of faith in Fascism?
- No, why?
- Subversive propaganda, perhaps?
- No, there's no reason for it.
And you know nothing
about the gramophone?
- The gramophone?
- Don't get smart with me! Answer!
I was asleep. They woke me.
I didn't even have time to put my tie on.
Your tie or your anarchist's neckerchief?
No. What neckerchief?
Would you like to drink a toast
to the victory of Fascism?
Well, really, at this time...
"At this time." "At this time!"
Damn fools!
Trying our patience this way!
- You must drink to a Fascist victory.
- Why do we have to crack your skulls...
...to make you understand
that Fascism...
...is for your protection,
for your dignity, your courage!
- Go to hell, you ignorant animals!
- Drink.
- This is castor oil.
- You're not drinking it?
No, I'm not drinking it. Why should I?
What have I done?
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! What are you doing?
Be good! Open your mouth!
Open your mouth!
Don't make me angry!
Drink it down, it'll do you good!
Just look at the state he's in,
a man of his age. It's shameful!
What are you doing,
vomiting on my shoes?
This is what saddens us...
...this utter refusal to understand.
Why?
- Kids take it when they're sick.
- Why, I ask?
And you're sick in the head!
Have some more.
It will clear your ideas!
- You'll pay for this!
- Well, just send us the bill.
Good heavens, it's 2:00!
Aurelio!
What's happened?
You won't listen to me!
You'll see!
Get up.
Dry yourself.
Don't catch cold.
- Dad!
- Go to bed.
Go to bed!
God, that stinks, Dad!
If the person who squealed
is who I think it is...
...he'd better move
to another continent...
...because I'll eat his guts!
I'll eat his balls!
Traitorous son of a bitch!
The Grand Hotel.
I call her the "Old Lady."
I come here every year
to sip the nectar of love.
I give kindness, and I yearn for kindness.
I'm the only one in town
to visit the Grand Hotel.
They say Gradisca was here once.
It was because of that highly
improbable adventure...
...that she came
to be called Gradisca.
Her real name is Ninola.
But they say that three years ago...
...one winter night...
- Don't let us down, Ninola!
The prince is a handsome man,
you know?
If he looks like he's satisfied,
mention the work on the harbor.
It will only take a word from him.
Be polite, speak proper Italian.
He's a real prince,
not just any old moron.
It's a great opportunity for you too.
The harbor.
Mr. Prince, sir...
Gradisca. Help yourself!
That's how Ninola
came to be called Gradisca.
I don't think there's a lot
of truth in this story.
Nor in everything that Biscein says.
He's a habitual liar.
He invents a new one each day.
You must know that two years back
an emir arrived with 30 concubines.
I was there. I saw him arrive.
Baldassar.
What? You'll break the camera!
The emir locked all 30 rooms
every night.
Yes, that is quite true, but the rest
of Biscein's story has many holes in it.
The silly man claims
that on that very night...
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!
Here I am! Here I am, giris!
Come on, Biscein!
Come on, Biscein!
Come on, Biscein!
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!
Yes! Yes!
I polished them all off. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven...
He claims, making no distinction
between the beautiful and ugly...
...he polished off 28 of them
that night!
Uncle. Uncle. Uncle!
Are you Polish? Because only Poles
have this fire in their eyes.
My uncle dances very well!
Commander! Ladies!
Then you must be Czech!
Because only Czech women
have this fire in their eyes.
I know Italian:
Good evening.
- Uncle! Uncle!
- Out! Get out of here!
Jesus, the asshole waiter.
Asshole, asshole, asshole...
- Have you seen the sea?
- The sea?
Come and take a walk with me.
Let's go!
Leopardi wrote poetry.
Do you know Leopardi?
No, this is my first time here.
Dante Alighieri here.
Leopardi here, or even here!
Oh, good!
Skol!
Lallo, how did it go?
Fine. I never had problems
with the Germans.
She's really fallen for me.
And to prove it, she even
offered me posterior intimacy.
Uncle! Uncle!
Uncle Teo was Daďs brother.
We went to take him for a ride
every month in the summer.
Uncle! He's coming, Dad.
He's coming.
Hello, Uncle!
- How's it going, Teo?
- He's happy, Mom.
- He's looking well.
- Yes, he's looking well.
- Let me through.
- Watch your step.
Here he is.
- Hi, Uncle! How are you?
- And how are you?
I'm fine. I go to school.
Guess where we're taking you today.
To eat passatelli at the farm!
Is my brother happy?
And look, Daďs here too. Yes!
Handsome son of mine.
Give your dad a kiss.
- Is he doing better?
- He's normal.
Look how he's grown.
He's in fifth grade.
Teo, how are you?
And Tino got so drunk the other night.
- How are you, Teo?
- I'm doing fine. I'm much better.
- Mom, the pastries!
- Here they are.
Uncle, Mom brought you pastries.
Well, we'll be back before evening.
- Here, have a cigar on me.
- Thanks.
Sit here next to your dad.
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?
Well, he's been dead 10 years now.
He's been gone for quite a long time!
- He was alive last year.
- That was Father Amedeo.
- Is he dead as well?
- No, Father Amedeo is alive.
Exactly, that's what I was saying.
I saw him last year with
a vase full of flowers.
He was walking and walking.
I wonder where he was going.
Teo was a bright lad when he was 8.
I don't want to offend you, Aurelio...
...but Teo was smarter than you
at school.
- He was smarter at everything.
- I can admit that.
It's the truth. He still is, even now.
Do you like being with us, Teo?
Uncle, the sea's over there.
It's like a blue streak.
- Dad, can I drive the horse?
- No.
What can I do just sitting here then?
Let me drive it!
It would be the first time a horse
was driven by a mule!
Isn't it faster that way?
It's an awful road, full of potholes,
enough to take this carriage.
- What is it? Something wrong?
- Leave him.
Why do you carry those in your pocket?
The stones.
- Aren't they heavy?
- But they're beautiful, stones are.
Yes! Stop the carriage, Tino!
Stop! Stop!
- What did he say?
- What is it now?
- Teo needs to take a leak.
- Well, if he has to.
Watch how you get down.
- You too?
- Yes. Why?
Don't be long, Grandpa, I'm hungry.
My father's father used to say:
"To be fit as a fiddle, you have to piddle!
To be fit as a frog, pee often like a dog."
How green! How wonderful, Teo.
- How old is the mare?
- Three years and two months.
She's only got one vice.
She can't stand train whistles.
When I'm at the station stand
I have to bend backwards to hold her!
- What will you feed her today?
- A plate of cappelletti.
Hey, you forgot to unbutton your fly!
Dad! Uncle pissed in his pants!
Goddamn!
They said he was normal!
He didn't undo his fly!
He forgot.
It's really true. The sea looks
like a blue streak. A long one.
- Uncle, you pissed in your pants!
- Shut up!
He didn't open the shop!
It doesn't matter.
You can change at the farm.
Titta!
Come here or I'll throw myself
under the wheels!
Sit down, you criminal!
- Shall we move on, sir?
- Yes, let's go.
And even today
we had a good meal!
You all go and see the spring.
My son Teo and I will stay here
and have a nice glass of wine.
Fine, but only one more glass.
You know what I'll do?
I'll have a little nap.
Good. It won't do you any harm
here in the shade.
The egg's lovely, isn't it, Teo?
I'm like that too. When I see an egg,
I could look at it for hours.
I ask myself, how can nature manage
to make things so perfect?
God made nature,
not an ignorant fool like you!
Oh, don't bust my chops! See you later.
I'm counting on you, Dad.
Menghino, how far away is this...?
How far away is this spring?
Uncle, look. I'm hypnotizing it.
Oliva!
Oliva, there's a toad!
It looks like Father Balosa!
Fly, baby, fly!
- How is it?
- Fantastic!
And it won't give you a hangover.
- We'll put it here.
- Good idea.
Throw that stone away!
You naughty little boy!
I know what your name is,
you delinquent!
- Dad.
- What is it?
Uncle Teo went up a tree!
- What's that? What's he shouting?
- I can't understand.
Uncle Teo went up a tree!
I want a woman!
I want a woman!
I want a woman!
But where am I going
to get you a woman, my boy?
- What woman are you talking about?
- Your uncle's up there.
I want a woman!
There he is! Up there, Dad!
Any nests up there, Uncle?
Come on, Teo.
Come down. You'll hurt yourself.
Don't just stand there! Go get a ladder!
Is this how you keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?
I'll go up, Dad.
I will hammer you into the ground
with my fist!
I want a woman!
How did he get up there? If he falls,
he'll break every bone in his body.
Miranda, go indoors and stop
with the drama.
- What drama?
- How did this happen?
We were having a drink with Tino here,
and next thing I knew...
I didn't even see him.
He shot up there like a cat.
What are you doing?
Throwing stones at your old dad!
Teo, come down. That's enough!
I'll kill myself! Goddamn it!
Now, now, Aurelio, don't be like that.
Come down, Teo, your brother's angry!
Don't be silly, now. Come down.
I want a woman!
It's quite a normal urge. He's 42!
- Yes, but he'll fall down.
- When I was 42...
I'm telling you!
Now that's enough. Climb down.
- Climb down, Teo!
- Don't forget about the nest, Uncle.
Menghino's coming up.
Good shot, Uncle! Right on his head!
- My head!
- You hit the bull's-eye!
Now I'll come up,
but don't throw anything at me!
We'll take some birds home...
- What is this?
- It hurts!
- Do you want to kill us all?
- I'm coming up.
Yes, sir! If you throw one at me,
you'll hear about it.
What a shot!
This guy is a murderer!
May somebody kick you in the nuts!
I want a woman!
Christ, what will I do now?
What will I do? Jerk off?
I'm an asshole.
An asshole, a stupid asshole!
Let's all go home then.
Tino, hitch up the horse.
We're going home!
Come on, let's go home.
Everybody, home!
- Are you going to leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse. Let's go!
- As you wish.
- Dad! Titta!
Call your mother! Where's your mother?!
- You're leaving him there?
- He's good up there.
- Let's go! I want to go home.
- But he's my son!
- Aurelio, listen to me.
- I want a woman!
Teo, you see? We're going. Come down!
- Dad, let's go!
- But he's sick.
We're just pretending. Hurry up!
Listen, Aurelio. Send me up there.
I'll talk to him.
He'll come down, you'll see.
Everybody! Get in the carriage.
- But Aurelio...
- We're leaving right away. Get in.
Teo, what are you doing?
Are you going to stay here?
We're going now. It's late.
It's getting dark.
Who will take you back?
You want to stay up there?
All right then, bye!
Maybe we can scare him with the rifle.
Come down!
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you going to come down or not?
Look, we're leaving! Go!
- Teo, come down! Teo!
- Goodbye, Uncle!
- I want a woman!
- Uncle will kill us all today.
Come on, everybody out!
Get out now! No questions!
What are you crying about?
Tino, run to the hospital
and call the attendants.
And come back right away,
or I'll throw myself down the well!
What are you crying about?
It's a big laugh, it's all just comic!
I want a woman!
Listen to him, Miranda. Poor lad.
Do you feel better?
I want a woman!
I can't stand it anymore! I can't!
Make him shut up!
- Dad? Dad!
- I've had enough!
- What do you want?
- Shall I go and call Volpina?
Dad, look!
Mom, they've arrived.
- Good evening, doctor.
- What's happened?
- He's up the tree.
- Nice place. Fresh air.
- Is this all yours?
- It's only an old farm.
- He's been up there for five hours!
- Where?
Up there. You can't see him now
because of the foliage.
- What have you done to him?
- Nothing.
He's been shouting and throwing stones.
I hope he won't be like this
his whole life, doctor.
A dwarf nun! Look!
- Itll be bad for him and worse for us.
- Relax, sir, she'll take care of it.
Were you getting a bit of air?
Is she going up?
Come down! I'm not going
to play these damn, silly games!
Jesus, just look at that!
She got him to come down!
She got him down, and he's quite happy.
Teo. Teo.
Here he is.
So have you been up
to your tricks again?
- No.
- What were you doing up there?
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow in this season.
Go home. Go home. Take him home.
Some days he's normal. Some days
he isn't. Just like the rest of us.
- Bye, Uncle!
- Oh, Titta. Take care.
You can see Gigino's place
from up there.
It's been a long time since I saw him.
Between 11:00 and midnight.
Yes, with Caghetta's boat.
It's 30 stories high
and has 16 smokestacks.
Think what a pirate could do
with a ship like that!
Come here!
Call your son, will you?
Where's Ronald Coleman?
I don't see him.
Gradisca's here! Gradisca!
Hurray for Gradisca!
Hurray for Gradisca!
Your steamboat is here.
Climb aboard!
Severino!
Where are all these people going?
Where are they going with hearts
all pounding?
Where are they going?
Today is a very important day
for our country, for our motherland...
- Come on, we're off! Let's go.
- I'm here!
If you drop me,
you owe me a new dress.
I'd like to tell you, but I can't...
...because it's all still in the air.
Where are these people going,
toward the open sea?
Enough, Giudizio!
- How far out will it be?
- Five miles.
But thanks to Galileo, it will
seem like 400 yards to us.
Marvelous!
It'll be like
it's coming straight at us.
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?
Two and a half times the weight
of the Grand Hotel.
Plus the Arch of Augustus!
- On the sea...
- Go thou, queen of the sea
Thou passeth and thy destiny
I shall follow in the waves
Watching the glistening wake
Get closer to your mother. And you,
ma'am, a little closer to your son.
Holy shit, guys!
The water's really freezing!
My nuts have shriveled
to the size of two dried beans.
- You swam out from shore?
- What do you think?
Freestyle.
I want to dance with you
All night like this...
The third day I went there
with my boat, whistled as usual...
...and out came the dolphin.
He put his head on the boat.
It looked at me and said, "Mama!"
Get the fuck out of here!
It's true. Dolphins are intelligent,
even my dentist said so.
Look how many there are.
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.
Jesus, you guys!
I wonder how the hell everything can
stay up there in place.
It's pretty simple for us.
If we have to build a house,
so many bricks, so much time...
...but up there, sweet Jesus,
where do you put the foundations?
They aren't just confetti,
you know!
Miranda. Are you asleep?
Answer me!
- Are you cold? Want my jacket?
- What?
- Go ahead, take it.
- I don't want it.
Come on, put it around your shoulders
or you'll get a chill and complain.
Is this going to take much longer?
It's 1:00.
How would I know?
They said it'd be around midnight.
Even if it's late, it's coming
from America, you know.
- Go fuck yourselves, all of you!
- What a friend.
He sent you his best wishes.
Every time I was full of hope,
but it never came to anything.
And now...
- Do you know how old I am?
- 52?
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.
In fact, I always add
a few years on.
- I'm 30.
- That's surprising, my darling.
- I haven't given up hope.
- I thought you were 27 or 28.
I want one of those long encounters
that last a lifetime.
I want a family, children, a husband...
...to chat with in the evening
at supper, maybe...
...and to make love with now and then,
because that's important too.
But affection is perhaps
even more necessary than love.
I'm so full of affection.
But who can I lavish it on, who wants it?
Why are you crying?
Look at the silly girl, she's crying!
She cries because the girl is delicate
and sensitive, oh, yes!
I'll be here for you!
- She's right! Men are all the same!
- Don't cry, my darling!
- Here it is!
- Dad, Dad!
The Rex! The Rex!
Hurray for the Rex! The greatest
thing the regime has built!
As the representative of the Podesta,
I wish you a safe journey!
Long live Italy!
- Come and buy from Biscein!
- What's it like?
What's it like?
What's it like? What's it like?
So long!
Hey!
Just look at this!
Can't see a thing!
I'll just keep to the wall.
The last fog like this was in '22.
Careful now, stop.
There's a man here!
Damn you. It's unbelievable!
Gina!
Gina!
Where am I?
I don't seem to be anywhere.
If death is like this...
...I don't think much of it.
Everything's gone.
People, trees...
...birds in the air, wine...
Up yours!
Tino!
I can't even find my house.
Where am I?
What do you mean?
You are in front of your house.
It's there.
Thank you!
- Where are you going in all this fog?
- To school. Bye, Grandpa.
Would you look at that.
I was in Norway.
Two women.
Beautiful, huge Norwegians!
Beans, olives,
toasted melon seeds!
Hey!
It's open, you can get in.
Last one in is a queer!
Naso, this way, take a look at this.
Look!
It's gorgeous!
Where are you, my love?
- Number 25. Varzi, you're God!
- It's Brilliperi.
- It was number 18.
- 18. Campari!
Aldina, do you know who it was?
- We know, it was Campari.
- I knew him in the race at Monza.
FINISH
Aldina!
- Lallo!
- Where are you going?
Be careful, Lallo!
- What is it?
- An ear.
Look, an ear!
Can I come in?
- I'm closed.
- Can I come in, miss?
- Good evening.
- What do you want?
One cigarette.
- Can I help you?
- You couldn't manage.
What do you mean?
I can lift 176 pounds.
I can even lift my father.
That's a good one!
- Why not? How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.
- I bet I could lift you too.
- Oh, yeah?
Let's see you.
- Look, I really can.
- Let's see.
I'll fall down!
You silly boy, let me go,
put me down!
- I did it!
- Why, you're strong!
See? Now, I'll lift you again.
- I don't believe you.
- Look.
Hey, that's enough now.
Put me down.
- Because I always...
- I told you to stop.
...thought you were...
- What are you doing? You'll let me fall!
- You crazy boy! Put me down!
...to die for!
You really are crazy, you know!
What's happened to me?
My head!
See how many times I did it?
Oh, yes. Yes, my little darling.
Come here.
You're a nice one too, you know?
Drive me crazy.
Drive me crazy, just a little.
- What should I do?
- Suck. Suck!
Come on.
You can have this one too.
Don't blow! Suck!
- Is this right?
- No, no.
My love. My love.
You have to suck, stupid!
- What are you doing?
- I can't...!
- I can't breath!
- Leave me alone.
Get out now.
I've got to close up.
What was it you wanted?
One cigarette?
Here. I'll give it to you for free.
Now, beat it!
Thank you.
- I can't do it.
- Get out of the way.
- Come on, get out.
- Good night.
Come on, drink it. I'll do you good.
- It's hot!
- It has to be hot.
There's a fly.
- Where is it?
- It's there. Over there.
It was there.
The only house with flies during winter.
How did it happen with you and Dad?
- What?
- How did you meet, fall in love...
...get married?
What's all this about?
Anyway, who remembers?
Your daďs not a great one
for compliments.
He was a laborer at Saludecio...
...and my folks, who had a bit of money,
didn't think much of him.
In fact... Well...
...we eloped without saying
a single word to anyone.
When did he give you your first kiss?
What kind of question is that?
Anyway, I don't even know
whether there was one.
The first time we saw each other
he raised his hat, and that's all.
It was the most one could do
in those days.
It's not like that now,
when you do all kinds of things.
- But I never do anything, Mom!
- Stay covered. You're all sweaty.
What do you want?
You're still in short pants.
Well, get me some long ones then,
like the other kid!
What other kid? Gina!
She told me not to send
any more love letters.
- And I said, "Why?"
- Take the bicycle...
...and tell the doctor to come sooner.
- Yes, ma'am.
Get him to examine you as well.
I'm worried.
Run along.
- But I'll send letters just when I like.
- Yes, yes.
In Africa! I'll become a doctor
and go to Africa!
- That will teach her!
- Yes.
It's snowing outside! It's snowing!
- It's true. It's snowing!
- Beautiful!
Professor Fighetta, up yours!
If it goes on like this, there will be
no school for a few days.
The mountains over there are all white!
Let's go and see the snow on the sea.
It's wet. It won't stick.
Go away! Get the hell out of the way!
Don't move! The sparrows!
- Good night.
- Wait. I'll come with you.
Hurry up.
Titta! Look how it's coming down!
Let's open the window.
Lovely!
Me too!
It's still snowing! Four days this
goddamn stuff's been around!
This will go down as "the year
of the big snow."
Since the last ice age...
...it never snowed so heavily
in our town.
Six feet and...
That must've been a boy,
not the other person.
As I was saying,
the exceptional years were...
...1541,1694...
...1728, 1888...
...when oddly enough,
it snowed on July 13th.
Got to hell, asshole!
Where did she...?
How's your mother?
Better now.
She's still in the hospital,
but she's off the critical list.
That's good. Poor woman.
Give her my regards when you see her.
Your mother's a kind lady.
She always brought me soup...
...and a glass of wine. She's good.
Good morning.
Mom!
Hi, Miranda.
How are you feeling?
- I've brought you some flowers.
- Thank you. How are you?
Hi, Aurelio. They're lovely!
I was just looking out,
now I'll go back to bed.
But I'm feeling better today.
What a lovely color!
- Are you hot with this?
- Thank you.
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.
- Are you still annoying your father?
- He slaps my head so hard, Mom!
I'll end up stupid!
There's a nice little garden here.
I didn't know.
It looks in bloom with the snow.
Mom, it's still snowing.
In a way, you're lucky, Miranda...
...to be here warm in bed
with this weather.
He's tired, poor man,
when he gets home.
- He works all day.
- Yes, Mom.
You shouldn't answer back.
You're a young man now.
Don't throw ice! It hurts!
Take that, Ovo!
With such wind and such snow,
who's there knocking at my door?
Idiot! No!
You stupid!
- Stop it! No!
- A difficult shot, Your Excellency!
- Oh, this time I hit you!
- Gradisca!
Take this, Gradisca!
No! Not at Gradisca! No!
You guys are strong!
Leave Gradisca alone!
Enough! I give up!
- Gradisca ran away!
- Gradisca, come here!
If you break my windows,
I'll kill you all!
Who is it?
- What is it?
- I don't know.
Look, it's the count's peacock!
There! There it is!
It's coming down!
Shall we catch it, boys?
What a moron!
I don't understand. What's happened?
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.
Why in the car?
Where are we going?
Quite near.
To Aunt Zaira's farm.
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hi to you.
Well, why doesn't he
come here, then?
Who is this relative, anyway?
Hi.
My aunt is dead.
Be strong. Be strong.
Titta, no.
Don't do that. Titta, open up!
- Open up.
- No, I won't!
Lallo! He's fainted.
Dad, Uncle's feeling sick.
Take him to the whorehouse then!
Make the sign of the cross, Dad.
- How do you feel now?
- Better!
- Little Miranda!
- Don't take it so hard. Be strong!
Now, everybody in line.
Where are the orphans?
Stop that!
- Hurray for the bride and groom!
- Hurray!
Give me your arm, Naso.
Make way, make way,
my breasts are full of milk!
I raise my glass
to the newlyweds...
...on this day full of hay
and say, may you live...
...happily in Battipaglia,
night and day.
When you're drunk, you can even rhyme!
Gradisca's getting married
and going away!
We want to say that we're sorry
if we made you angry...
...and we hate to see you go!
We'll miss you badly!
- Hurray for the newlyweds!
- Hurray!
Words are silver, silence is gold.
May this married couple's love
never get old!
- Where is the bride?
- Over there.
Our Gradisca is going away because
she's found her Gary Cooper.
Well, Gary Cooper is a cowboy,
and Matteo is an officer...
...but love's always love.
Good luck, Gradisca!
Long live the bride and groom!
Today you have crowned
your dream of love.
Now you have a joyous duty
to have many children.
For your family, for the church
and for your country!
Now that we're together under this sky,
let's drink one more and say goodbye.
Photograph! Photograph!
Now we'll take a great photograph!
- A mirror!
- Everybody get behind the bride!
This is going to be
a damn good photograph!
She's lovely, our Ninola!
Why are you crying? Are you crazy?
- I'm not.
- Get closer together.
The officer must move back a little.
Shoo!
There. In the light.
- Hold it right there!
- Hey, it's raining.
Big smile. Good, good. Done!
Another one.
Excuse me!
Don't fall all over her, you drunken lout!
I want to hug her too!
It's dark over here.
Let's move into the sun.
Follow me.
Here, this is a good place.
Get together. The bride in the center
and the groom over there.
I've made up another poem
that goes like this:
Though the worid may be full
Of beautiful things
Full of towns that are attractive
Even more than this
A drop of water will be good for you.
This way you'll get a bath.
Get up!
It's stopped raining, sit down.
Sit down! Play!
- A wet bride is a lucky bride!
- It's the same sea, Ninola...
...that stretches from here
to our Battipaglia, therefore:
- Long live Italy!
- Long live Italy!
Why, thank you!
Thank you.
How will you live
So far away from our town?
Goodbye to you all!
Go home! Bye!
- Biscein bids you goodbye!
- I ate four bowls of soup...
...two chickens, three pounds
of sausages and one candle.
Naso!
Naso, I'm going home!
Wait for me. I'll come with you!
Wait for me, you jerk!
My bouquet! Wait!
So long! I love you all!
- Gradisca's going!
- She's leaving!
- So long, Gradisca!
- Goodbye!
- So long, Gradisca! So long!
- So long!
Lallo...
...look!
That stuff is mine!
The puffballs!
- Titta!
- Naso!
Where's Titta?
Shall we go fishing in the harbor?
Titta went away a long time ago.
