Hey. You Don't know me.
I Don't know you.
    Katie, voice-over:
    Twice in my life,
    I've had to deliver bad news
    to someone I'd never met.
Hey...
        The first time
        involved a cat
That ran out in the middle
    of my driver's test.
        This time
    was a bit trickier.
Hey...
        [rings doorbell]
        Are you waiting for me
        to say something?
    No.
I Don't know
where to start.
    Well, why Don't you start
    from the beginning?
Ok. Ok. Um...
        [telephone rings]
    [music playing loudly]
            Hello.
            What?
            Grandma.
        Turn that down!
    Grandma, what's the matter?
    Katie: My grandfather
        always told me--
    Never pick up the phone
    on the first ring.
        What?
        Katie:
    And now he was dead.
What? What happened?
    I was the first one
    my grandmother called.
        I waited until
    I could see straight
    Before I broke the news
        to my dad.
        He's sort of
        a famous actor.
    You may remember him
as the spiffy peanut butter kid.
        My dad's the one
with the spoon in his mouth.
What is it, son?
            Something is stuck
            to my tongue.
        [laughter]
    Must be weird to have
    your career peak at 8.
        Hey, folks.
    How many towels can I get
        for you today?
How many
have you got?
    Katie: Now he works mostly
    in obscure foreign films.
        All right, but...
        Only if I can watch.
        Man: Keep looking
            at them.
    That's it. Oh, yeah.
        Get turned on.
    He's removing her clothes.
    He's massaging her breasts.
        Let me see that
        in your eyes.
        You're surprised.
    Down go her pants. Ah!
    Maybe you're gonna
        get caught.
    They're not supposed
    to be doing that.
                        [ring]
I'm sorry. That's me.
Hello.
            Don't answer that.
            Look sexy.
Oh, hey, sweetie.
            Smoky eyes...
    I want to see envy.
    You want to be that guy.
What?
            You want it.
He did?
            That's it.
        Touch yourself.
        Yeah. Oh, yeah.
I'll call them.
I'll call them.
        Dearest judge--
                Excuse me?
        My client...
            Name?
Uh...Lace.
        Miss lace...
        Was engaged
    in a consensual servicing
    Of an entrapable member.
            Are you an attorney?
    Touché, your highness.
    [cell phone ringing]
        Talk to me.
                    Counselor.
            What?
            Whoa.
        Ok. Now put
        the eggs down
    Without breaking them
and without using your hands.
    Come on, guys. We're--
        What's he doing?
                        Watch.
    We Don't have time
for this, guys. All right?
            No good
        can come of this.
        Nice. Can we go now?
Do a shoulder stand.
        Guys, come on.
    We've got this funeral.
                Grandpa's not
                going anywhere.
        Get in the car.
Get the bowl onto the table
without spilling.
            [crash]
            Oh...
            This is why
            your mother left us.
        She was a hack.
I've seen better
moms on TV.
                    I know.
I Don't even know
why we're going.
            I mean,
        he was your dad.
                Maybe he left
                you something.
        Probably left it
        all to wifey.
Nana.
                I know.
            He picked
            the perfect time
            For this one,
            didn't he? Huh?
                Huh, Burt?
        You know it's 2 weeks
        before his birthday,
        The one day that was
        more important to him
        Than his goddamn job,
        And now he's managed
        to fuck this up, too.
            Sorry.
            [sighs]
        Nice work, pop.
Is everybody coming?
                Yeah. The asylum
                Will be full.
I can't believe grandpa's
not gonna be there.
            I know, sweetie.
            [beep]
        You're doing
        the right thing.
         You're fully
         experiencing the loss.
        And when you're ready,
        take a deep breath in...
            [inhales deeply]
            Like that.
        Try to really maximize
        the feeling.
            Feel it
            really intensely.
            And then
            as you exhale...
                [exhales]
        Just try to let
        those feelings go, ok?
He just died.
        Yeah...I know.
        But believe me,
        it's the way
        Your grandfather
        would have wanted it.
To be dead?
    Oh, where can she be?
            Where's my little
            tubby turtle?
        I'm not a turtle.
            I'm Katie.
            Well, I'm looking
            for someone
            To help me eat...
I will, pom pom.
            A hot-fudge sundae.
You ok?
Come on. Let's go
find your grandmother.
    Don't see why
    you want to wait.
        [door opens]
    They have
    a right to know.
                No. It's
                my decision now.
    Fair enough.
        Man: Hello? Mom?
You have an appointment
with the parson tomorrow.
            I Don't think so.
Man: There she is.
            Danny boy.
Hey, Lance.
        Good to see
        you, son.
    Grandma.
                    Oh, baby.
                Oh...
                You know what?
            He loved you
            and your daddy
            More than anybody
            else in the family.
I know that's
not true, but thanks.
                No. Really.
            He couldn't even
            remember the names
            Of his other 2
            children.
        3 children.
            Oh. Always thinking
            of others.
Hey, mom.
        Woman: Burt.
    Burt, did you grab...
I have to go.
Are you sure
you're ok?
        I feel as if I
        finally have a Chance
            To do something
            with my life.
    Good.
Aah!
            Alice.
        Glad to see you.
Lance.
Katie, Katie, Katie.
                Oh, Alice. What
                are we gonna do?
I think I'll just
take my old room
And then...Danny.
                Hey, Alice.
Oh, I was just waiting
to see you on television, huh?
        Well, you may not
    have to wait very long.
        I actually--
Right. I'm just--
mother...
God! I'm trying
to get to the sorrow.
I really am, but I
still feel so angry.
I mean, I want to just
grab him and shake him
And say,
"how dare you?
"how dare you go
out that back door
"with your little
suitcase?
I mean, where in god's name
are you going this time?"
I'm ok, though.
I'm ok. I'm sorry.
            Oh! I've never heard
            you say that word.
Well, we Don't have to make
a talk show out of it, do we?
            Burt!
        Don't tarry.
        Don't tarry.
                Hi, Burt.
                Hi, kids.
        Hey, Burt.
            We've had a very
            difficult trip.
    So we should probably
        just consider
        What everybody
        wants to eat,
    And that way, we can
    just make one dish
    That suits the group...
    Katie, voice-over:
Alice and her husband Burt
    Had managed to produce
    3 silent children.
    Alice: My tribe only eats
    bread and American cheese
        In various forms,
        so I mean...
    I could make this dish
I think everybody might enjoy,
    This little casserole
    that I like to make.
    I'm sort of famous
around my house for making it.
    Have you said hello
    to your grandmother?
            Let me take a look
            at you three.
        Stop looking like
        she's gonna bite you.
        She's not gonna
        bite you.
    Stop it. Stop feigning
    those fake little twitches
        That you're doing.
        We've talked...
    Katie, voice-over:
My grandmother always said
        She wished Alice
    came with a mute button.
        Alice: If you think
        it's any better
        At any of your
        friends' house,
    If you think it's any
    better at their house,
You can just pack your bags
    and move in with them.
        [no audio]
        [doorbell rings]
            Ah, that's better.
            All right,
            treat everybody
            With respect, ok?
            Let's try not to be
            The biggest freaks
            in the circus.
        What the hell
    is that supposed to mean?
He wants us to say,
"no, thank you,"
Instead of
"eat my ass Jell-O."
            Hey, stop it.
            All right?
            Stop it,
            for Christ’s sakes.
            Where do you guys
            learn that shit?
            Mom...
            Sorry about dad.
                Yeah...Mmm...
                You remember
                the boys.
How could I forget them?
                        Hey, g.
        So, what did he
            leave us?
Your grandfather's will
won't be read
Until after the funeral.
                    Talk about
                    being early.
    Seriously, man.
        God, dude.
    You always hit me first.
                He pushed me.
Hey, skipper.
                Hey.
Alice: Oh, why do terrible
things always come in threes?
    I see Alice is already
rifling through the drawers.
No. I'm looking
for ingredients.
I'm going to make us
all dinner tonight.
                    Hmm...
            Hey, uncle skip.
    Hey. Hi.
        Hey, boys.
                Hi, Katie.
        Katie, voice-over:
    Uncle skip and the twins
    Were a little heavy
        with hormones,
        But they were
        at those ages.
        I used to have
        an aunt Lily, too,
    But they scared her away.
        Family legend
        says it was
        The night before
    their eleventh birthday.
                What the hell
                is that?
It's your birthday cake.
I was hoping it
would be a surprise.
                I'm more
                than surprised.
                I'm shocked.
This isn't
what we ordered.
        You Don't order
        your mother.
    I spent 2 days making--
            We ordered an erotic
            cheesecake.
        Excuse me?
                You're excused.
We'll fix it.
        Oh, no. Oh, god.
        [Lily crying]
    Oh...What?
        What?
            They ruined it.
             They ruined it.
Well, it is
their birthday, right?
            Where did they
            even hear the term
            "erotic cheesecake"?
Somebody's got to teach them
these things, right?
            What..."things"?
            That you can make
            a cheesecake
            Look like
            disembodied breasts?
    Or an ass.
        [piano playing]
            Katie, sweetheart,
            I want you
            To eulogize
            your grandfather.
Oh, grandma, I Don't think
I can make a speech.
I wouldn't know
what to say.
            If it were me,
            I would want you
            To say something
            that made some...
                Sense
                out of my life,
                Something
                that honored me.
Hey, what about dad?
Or skip? Or Lucy?
                Your grandfather
                wanted you.
                And you boys
                are going to
                Have to help
                with the burial.
Your father left
very specific instructions.
                        Ok.
        Hi, everybody.
                Hey, ladies.
            You remember skip?
    Yeah.
                And these are
                his 2 boys...
                Tim and Jim?
        Close enough.
Hi, guys. I'm, uh...
Lucy's life partner,
Judy.
    Lesbians.
                    Lesbians.
Alice: I really can't
believe you brought her.
                Hello, Alice.
No, it's just I thought
you'd come alone. It's family.
                Are you starting
                already?
        Oh, no. It just...
        It didn't occur to me
        To bring my sex toys.
    Did you bring any sex toys?
            You wouldn't know
            a sex toy
            If it left a battery
            in your vagina.
                Oh. My vagina,
                as you were
            So whimsically about
            to refer to it,
            Has served
            as sacred passage
            For 3 anatomically
            correct children.
                    So...
                    Bad image.
Erase, erase.
    So, who needs a drink?
        Let's drink.
    Katie, voice-over:
    My family still observes
    The cocktail hour...
    With a vengeance.
This isn't
about you, so...
                Are you talking
                to the sex toy?
I'm sure you're
a very nice...Lesbian.
Is that
the preferred term?
            No. No.
            We prefer "whore."
            I think all women do
            these days.
    Well...
I guess I owe you
an apology.
                Are you working
                up to it?
        So...
What do you girls do?
            What do you mean,
            "what do we do"?
    For fun.
            We eat out,
            go to the movies.
Oh, normal stuff.
            Drinks.
            Ladies.
Thank you.
                Thank you.
                What did you
                think we did?
No, I didn't have a...
I wasn't thinking
of something,
And I just...I...
I Don't know
what you do.
            Do you think
            we spend all night
            Triple-tonguing
            our cheese pots?
        Ah...
    It's my father's funeral,
        So if you could
            muster up
Just a little bit of respect,
        that would be...
Don't worry...You know.
Don't worry about Alice.
You think she's gone,
she comes back, you know...
    Like herpes.
                Thanks, skip.
So, how are you
and Lucy doing?
            Well, I mean...
            This is just awful.
I know. I hate being
around my family, too.
                Oh.
Yeah. But, I mean...
How are you doing...
You know...
    Physically?
                Physically?
Well, yeah. I mean,
like you said...What is it?
Triple-tonguing.
What is that?
Is that a thing...
What are you doing?
            Go talk
        to your mother.
You talk to her.
She's a downer.
        She's a widow.
She was
a downer first.
        Just go talk
        to your mother.
                    Excuse me.
    Ok.
Do you need
a punch?
 Do you want me
 to punch you?
            You have
        real problems.
You Don't do that.
You Don't throw
A lemon at me
in front of a lesbian.
Nice going.
    Danny: Me nice going?
    "the triple-tongue thing"?
                        Hi.
                My dad died
                when I was 11.
    Oh.
                I'm sorry.
            I Don't know
            why I said that.
What size are you?
                        Me?
Come upstairs.
This is the dress
I wore on the boardwalk
    In 1956.
                It's...
                It's so elegant.
It's yours.
I wore it once.
 It was
 a great night,
Maybe the best
night of my life.
It's a lucky dress.
                    I couldn't.
Oh, please.
Take them all.
I know we Haven't spent
that much time together,
But I already know
I like you better
Than I like Alice.
                    Ha ha!
And besides, Katie
and Lucy aren't my size.
                Thank you.
    [[indistinct conversation]
            [stammers]
            It's a little bit
            runnier than usual.
            Think I just didn't
            put--move it.
                Put enough
                cheese in it.
    This looks like it fell
        out of a horse.
Thanks, but I already had
my mucus course for the day.
        Listen. You shut
        your spit cave,
        You foul-mouthed
        little shit fucker
    Before I beat the living
        snot out of you.
I'm going down to doc's
to pick up some lobster,
If anyone wants in.
                    Yes, please.
Good idea.
Yeah, it's
a good idea.
    Get some big ones
    with big meaty claws.
                As a side dish,
                it's fine.
Well...
            God, it's so good
            to get out of there.
            Katie, it's good
            to see you.
    Oh, Luce, I'm so sorry.
            Yeah. Well, it's ok.
            Nobody else
            in the family
            Seems to give
            a crap.
Yeah, I've noticed.
                So, you coming?
    Where?
                To the wedding.
What wedding?
            Isn't that what
            you're sorry for?
I'm sorry about grandpa.
            Oh, Katie, nobody
            blames you.
                    Two
                    for dinner?
        No. I called in
        an order for Collins.
                Let me check
                on that for you.
What wedding?
                Judy and I are
                getting married.
    Really?
                Vows
                and everything.
Congratulations.
                I sent you
                an invitation.
No, you didn't.
            It's ok. Everybody
            in the family
            Is pretending
            they didn't get it.
I didn't get one.
            I distinctly
            remember weeding
            The family invites
            out early. No.
            I went to the...
                I put them...
                Wait.
                I mailed them.
                I know it.
                    Ah!
                I am such
                a bonehead!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Oh! Well...
                Here you go.
            What are you doing
            down there?
    It's Ryan.
Little Ryan
from the be--aah!
What are you doing?
He could hear you!
            Hi.
    Katie, voice-over:
    Little Ryan...
    My childhood friend.
        Since before
        I can remember,
    We spent our summers
            together.
    (music) two fire-filled
        car mats (music)
        (music) never could
    heed that warning (music)
    (music) stay in the Sky (music)
Katie, voice-over: He always
acted like he had a crush on me,
    And I always acted
    like I didn't notice.
It seemed like nothing could
    ever come between us...
    Until the last night
        of last Summer.
    (music) a peculiar ride (music)
        (music) 'cause this is
        our last Chance (music)
    (music) and to that big mistake (music)
    (music) we are bound to make (music)
    Katie, voice-over:
    His parents were off
    Camping somewhere
    with his little brother,
        And everything
        was perfect--
        The flicker
    of the candlelight,
    The gentle dancing
    of the rain on the roof,
     The familiar sound
     of a car door slamming.
        [car door slams]
        Katie. Katie. Katie!
    Katie, voice-over:
        I never meant
        For anything
    to happen between us.
    I couldn't let there be
        any witnesses.
Woman: I could
heat up some lasagna
If you boys
are hungry.
Oh, hi...Katie.
Nice to see
you again.
                Let's hear it.
            No.
                    Come on.
                    Do it.
            No.
One last time.
                    Ok.
                This one's
                for dad.
        Something is stuck
        to my tongue.
                Oh! There it is.
        Wow.
                    If I ever...
Single bullet.
                To my left eye.
This is a good time.
         How can this be
         a good time?
        Your dad just died.
My family could use
a little good news.
    Trust me.
        Hey, everyone,
I have an announcement to make.
        We sent out
    some invitations--
        Or at least,
    I thought we did--
And I was actually getting
pretty angry at all of you.
            I suspected
        some sort of--ah.
    Anyway, myself and Judy--
                "Judy and I."
Judy and I would like to--
                    [sniffles]
    What is it, Fred?
                    It's Ted.
                    Ha ha ha!
        What are you
        laughing at?
I Don't know.
                But I can't wait
                to find out what
                You 2 vaginiuses
                are up to.
        What did you
        just say?
Nice vocab word.
        What did he
        just call us?
                    Vaginiuses.
                It's a compound
                compliment.
        You see what
        I put up with?
    How can you tell me not to
    scream my fucking head off?
                    You're
                    losing it.
No! These are the people
that you want at our wedding?
            Oh, is one of you
            getting married?
We both are.
                    To who?
To each other.
                    Ha ha ha.
Awesome!
                How many friends
                can we bring?
            Alice: Ha ha ha.
            Oh, this is so rich.
                Katie: I think
                it's great.
        Very great.
Congratulations,
really.
        So, where's
    the wedding happening?
        In a dream?
No, Alice.
In a town hall.
        Oh. Look, I just think
        it's sad, all right?
        Two women pretending
        to be married.
    I pretended I was married
        for 12 years.
            And I think that
            marriage is based
            On commitment
            and communication
        And not necessarily
        the presence of a penis.
    Thank you.
        Excuse me. My children
        are here, all right?
            Watch your language.
        What, are you worried
        they're gonna repeat it?
        Burt, are you
    gonna stand for this?
        Do you hear
    what's going on here?
        [Burt laughing]
            I...Uh...
                Burt. Burt.
                I mean...
                At least Burt
                and me know
            How we're supposed
            to fit together.
    "Burt and I."
 Is that what this
 is all about?
Is that what everyone
in this fucked-up family
Needs to know--
how we go together?
Well, we often start
by gently kissing...
                Oh, I am not
                doing this.
                 I said I am not
                 doing this.
    Fred: Aw, come back!
            Aunt Lucy was really
            making her point.
    So, Luce, since you're
    having people perform,
    You know, fake ceremonies
        and stuff,
        Why Don't you
        just have them
        Announce you queen
        or president?
    Shut it.
        Fred and Ted:
        All right!
                        Ok.
            Because, I mean,
            there are programs--
Shut your
goddamn mouth!
                Who just cast
                a spell on you!
        Oh, here we go!
            Make you less afraid
            of male genitalia.
    Shut it!
                    Whoa! Whoa!
        When did you get
    so much stronger than me?
Shut it.
                Oh, I forgot.
                You're not.
    Aah!
            Table.
                    Wuss.
Oh, no.
                        Whoa!
        [screaming]
        [doorbell rings]
                        Guys!
All right. That's
almost enough.
                    Danny: God.
I love this family.
                And you didn't
                want to come.
    Katie, voice-over:
    One thing about being
            In such
    a theatrical family--
    It's easy to lose track
    Of everything that's
    happening offstage.
        Grandma.
Grandma.
    Grandma.
                [knocking]
            Grandma, are you ok?
                Grandma:
                I'm all right.
                Katie: Open up
                the door.
            Mom.
Clear.
            What?
    Clear!
                    Ow!
    Alice: What happened?
                What did you do?
        I just slipped,
and I spilled all this stuff.
    Somebody please get me
        a glass of water.
            Get her some water.
I'm fine.
                Are you hurt?
                Can you get up?
    How did you fall down?
                She slipped.
        Thank you all
            so much.
Grandma, what
are you doing?
            Mom!
                    I knew it!
    [P.A. Announcement]
                    Stop it.
                Just stop it.
I am not
doing anything.
        Man: Collins.
        I'm dr. Rice.
We pumped your mother's stomach.
        Alice: It was
        an accident.
            How did she
            accidentally chug
            Half a bottle
            of sleeping pills?
                She was cleaning
                them up.
        With her mouth?
We need to keep her
for the night,
But she's going
to be fine.
She recently lost her husband,
        and she slipped,
        And I think
    she got confused with--
Lucy? Little Lucy
toothy, is that you?
It's been so long.
        Samantha, hi.
    Alice.
How are you?
                    Great.
                    Just great.
    When can we
    take her home?
        Well, like I say,
        just overnight,
        And then tomorrow
        we'll sign her out
        And you can
        take her home.
            Well, I think...
            Could you keep her
            for another day,
            Just to be safe?
Oh, my god.
                        Bite me.
        [telephone rings]
                    Skip.
                Hey, sis. Did
                they puke her?
                All right,
                I'll spread it.
                All right. Bye.
                She unswallowed.
Oh, thank god.
Poor grandma.
            Yeah.
    She just wants to be
    the star of the funeral.
                No, she doesn't.
Hey, Elvis killed himself
because someone
Was gonna write a book
about his underwear wrestling.
                    What?
What are you doing?
        Grandma asked me
    to speak at the funeral.
            Huh. Nobody
            asked me to speak.
    Do you want to?
    Because I have no idea
        what to say.
Just say...
    [sighs]
He was away so much,
It was weird
to have him around.
        [pouring cereal]
                I just want
                to say something
                Beautiful
                and poetic.
Pop loved poetry.
                        He did?
    Yeah.
All the ones
about Nantucket.
I think his favorite
was about
A little
handicapped girl--
There once was
a girl who was crippled
By the weight
of her overgrown nipple.
    Katie, voice-over:
I needed to talk to someone
    Who saw grandpa clearly.
    (music) as I remember your eyes (music)
        (music) were bluer
    than Robin's eggs (music)
    (music) my poetry was lousy,
        you said (music)
                [knock on door]
Katie: Dad.
        (music) where are you
        calling from? (music)
            (music) a booth
        on the midway (music)
Dad, are you
in there?
    [knocking on door]
        (music) 10 years ago,
I bought you some cufflinks (music)
        (music) you brought me
        something... (music)
    [turns down music]
Dad, the door is locked,
and I need to talk.
                Katie?
        Dad?
                Fuck!
                Coming.
    Dad.
                Coming.
                Fuck! Fuck!
                    Ah!
    Dad.
                Coming.
                Coming, sweetie.
                Goddamn it!
Is that a joint?
                        Ah!
        Dad?
Yes, boys?
            So, uh...How's
            that book going?
    It's hot.
            Can we...Help you
            with anything?
        Maybe, uh...
        Intern with you?
You can rub my feet
if you want.
Mom has that appointment
with the parson tomorrow.
            Yeah. Well,
            Don't worry,
            Because I'm
            gonna spring her.
        She was trying
        to kill herself.
                Yeah. It's
                pretty common.
                In fact, after
                Scandinavians,
                It's the over-70
                crowd
                That is the most
                suicidal.
Well, shouldn't we be doing
    something to help her?
            No. Mm-mmm.
        Because once people
        have their mind made up,
        There's really
        very little
        That you could do
        to stop them.
    There's got to be
    something we can do.
Do you remember
that game against Easton?
            Oh, yeah. They were
            a very tough team.
No, but do you
remember...
Naomi in the hotel
with the oow-oow-oow?
Do you remember?
    "oh, look at how silly
    and normal I can act
        When I'm not
    persecuting my sister."
        [mock laughter]
    So...
How often
do you smoke?
                You know...
                Never
                in the morning.
    Dad.
                I know. That
                was really lame.
                I just...
            I Don't know what
            I'm doing anymore.
You're mourning.
                    Yeah.
                    What?
You're mourning.
                Yeah. Yes.
                I think I am.
                    Yeah.
            You'd think I'd be
            over it by now.
Well, dad,
it just happened.
                    No.
                He's been dead
                for years.
    What?
            If I just
            would have gotten
        That stupid
        toothpaste commercial.
        That was the moment.
            I swear to god.
What are we
talking about?
            I was the choice
            For this toothpaste
            campaign.
            I was the guy,
            and I just...
            I could not
            say the line.
            I literally...
            I couldn't say it.
            "it's the breath
            freshiest."
                I just...
            Ok. I can't believe
            I just said that.
        I have never been able
        to say that before.
        It's like a tongue
        twister for me.
            "it's the breath
            freshiest."
            Oh, my god!
                Ha ha...
                Fuck.
Um, dad, are you ok?
            Yeah. I'm sorry.
            I'm sorry.
            It's just...
            I just feel
            sometimes
            Like I've spent
            my whole life
            In this waiting room
            At an audition,
            you know,
        And they finally called
        my fucking name,
            And I just...
        And then somebody else
        stood up, you know,
        And they got my role,
        And they've been
        living my life,
        And I'm just groping.
            I've just been
            stumbling around
            In the dark
            ever since then.
                [sighs]
            Your mom knew.
            Your mom knew.
            She always said,
            "we have to get out
            of acting, Daniel."
Mom was an actress?
                    No.
You just said, "we have to
get out of acting."
        No. I must have...
        Misspelled something.
    What?
                    What?
You told me mom
was a social worker
Who died
of caring too much.
            [stifling laughter]
            I said she...
            What did I say
            she did?
                Ha ha ha.
Dad, did you lie to me?
                No, no, no, no.
    No?
                No. No.
        I probably was just...
        Protecting you.
So, mom was an actress?
                Well...
Is there anything
I could see her in?
                    No.
    No?
                No. Well...
                    Uh...
What kind of movies
did mom make, dad?
            Honestly,
            it's not that bad.
            She never used
            her real name.
    Katie: Do you have any...
        Do you have any
    cookie tushala movies?
I'll check, but we're
probably all out.
                Is that
                Katie Collins?
    Hi.
            Hi, Katie.
        I Haven't seen you
        Since you were
        at the house with...
You're in luck.
And this one's
possibly her best,
Just for its utter
lack of story.
            We heard about
            your grandfather.
        Oh, yes. We didn't
        know him very well,
        But we're very sorry.
    Oh, thanks so much.
Yeah.
That'll be $3.50.
                Does Ryan know
                you're here?
        Oh. Wait till he hears
        who we saw renting...
             <i>Vagina town.</i>
    Ha ha. Thanks.
It's a classic.
                    Ha ha ha.
                    How would
                    I know?
    [doorbell jingles]
    Katie, voice-over:
    All of my life,
        I've wished
    I could see my mother.
        Be careful
    what you wish for.
        [gunshots]
        [doorbell rings]
    [western music playing]
        Man on videotape:
        Howdy, ma'am.
Fred: Coming.
    I just rode into town
from a long ride on the trail.
    We didn't see this town
        On any of our
    trail maps, ma'am.
        Ryan: Hey, dudes.
    I'm looking for Katie.
She's here
somewhere.
Cousin Katie!
    Woman on videotape:
        This here town
            Is unlike
        any other town.
        Man on videotape:
        Yes, ma'am.
This is a very unusual town
        you have here.
    Woman on videotape:
    I Hope you boys
        Know how to ride
            bareback.
                Holy Jesus!
                His penis!
    Katie, voice-over:
Most people Don't even like
To think of their parents
having sex with each other,
    Much less with multiple
        bad actors.
    I had to do something.
                Alice: Morning.
Katie: Morning.
                    Coffee?
No.
    Other families have
    these sort of problems,
    But they Don't talk
    about them, all right?
    I mean, I'm sorry.
I live in the real world.
    I work hard at raising
        a decent family.
            Oh!
You Don't see me prancing around
    in my pajamas all day,
Starting up pillow fights
with my topless girlfriend.
                What are we
                talking about?
It won't work.
Everyone knows
That the only gay
relationships that last
Are between people
of the same height.
                Did you and Lucy
                ever get along?
Well, I guess.
Well, when your grandfather
was around, of course.
            He kept the peace?
No, no, no.
He just kept us
on eggshells.
He had us all so desperate
    for his approval.
        Well, look
        at your father.
        He made a career
            out of it.
                    Morning.
        Morning, Danny.
                    Everybody
                    sleep ok?
            Never.
        Danny: Hey, did we have
        a blackout last night?
That's what I heard.
        We sure did. I couldn't
        even find my room--
                What?
You found
my room all right.
                It was dark.
So you hid
in my closet?
                With your kids?
    We were lost.
                Hey, you guys,
                listen to this.
                Tell me
                how it sounds.
        "grandpa made us aware
        that there is
        A whole world
    of opportunity out there."
                    He did?
        Who are we
        talking about?
Grandpa.
                Tell her
                about the time
                That dad built
                us that swing.
        That was Carl,
        the neighbor.
    Alice: Mr. Grabby.
                Mr. Grabby
                built the swing?
Mmm. Oh, he was
so creepy.
        He'd put his hand
        on your shoulder
        And announce,
        "you're it."
        Then he wouldn't
            run away.
        He wouldn't even
        take his hand away.
                    Right.
    Um...Hi, you guys.
    There was a lot
    of paperwork,
    And I had to pull
    some strings
    And sign
    a lot of names,
        But she's back.
Grandma.
                There she is.
Hi, mother.
        Try it again,
        I'll kill you myself.
                        Alice.
Well, I have to get
back to work, so...Bye.
                    Thanks, Sam.
    What happened, grandma?
            Nothing happened.
            I was just
            a little confused.
About what?
        I thought the vows
        we took were forever.
Katie: They were.
It's just that
your forever
Was longer than
grandpa's forever.
                Hi, everybody.
Hi.
            Hey, Ryan.
Hey, Ryan.
How are you?
            Good. Um...
            I'm sorry about
            your grandfather.
Hey. You know...
He died. Ha ha.
            Yeah. Um...
            You know, it's...
             You can't, uh...
            You want to, like,
            go for a walk or...
                    So...
    So...
Still driving a taxi?
                Yeah. Yep.
            To save up money
            for college.
            Are you mad at me?
    No.
                    Really?
Really. I mean it.
You're a great kid.
            Um...Thanks, coach.
No, I just...
I just think that...
What happened
last Summer was--
                    What?
                What happened?
At your house.
                Oh, you
                Don't mean...
                That time when
                you attacked me
                At the movie
                theater,
            And then you came
            over to my place
             And took all
             your clothes off
        And then ran out without
        saying good-bye.
            Is that what you're
            talking about?
                Katie.
                    Knock-knock.
Who's there?
                    Salmon.
Salmon who?
                    Salmonella.
        What are you doing?
            Science experiment.
            How many eggs
            does it take
            To make them
            say something?
Speak,
young cousins.
        Burt, you see
    what's going on here?
                    Burt.
    Oh. Uh...
        Uh...
    Ha ha ha.
        Uh...
        [egg cracks]
            What has Alice done
            to all of you?
                Now, this is
                my favorite.
                Cherry,
                inlaid Olive,
                And real brass
                fittings.
                At just $32,000,
                It's quite
                a steal.
    Just $32,000?
                How much
                does it cost
                To stick him in
                a garbage bag?
    Mother!
            What does he care?
Mom, it's just
unbelievably disrespectful.
            This isn't even
            going in the ground.
        What?
What do you mean?
    Danny: Dad wanted us
    to float him out
    In a flaming boat.
                I'm not sure
                that's legal.
        Great.
    Well, my kids are not
    staying for that.
Why doesn't he
want to be buried?
                I Don't want
                to be buried.
No. This is not
about you.
                I hate bugs.
    Yeah, I have to admit,
    I Don't exactly get
    The whole cemetery
        thing myself.
            A cemetery is like
            An old-age home
            for the dead,
        A place where you can
        visit your loved ones
            Without the bother
            Of daily care
            and maintenance.
    Daily care?
                Oh, you'd be
                surprised.
        [door opens]
Ah, Parson Banker.
                Sad business.
                Sad business.
        This is the surviving
        Collins family.
    I'm Alice Collins.
Hi. I'm Daniel.
                Daniel. Hi.
    Hi.
    They're mourning the loss
    of their beloved Edmund.
                    Ah. Ah.
            I didn't know Edmund
            As well
            as I should have.
            Perhaps if we
            had ever met...
                    Katie.
                Katie. Katie.
    Katie, Katie, Katie,
        I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I Don't want
anything that may
Or may not have
happened between us
To affect
our friendship.
                You mean that?
Yeah. I Don't have
any friends like you.
            So we'll be friends?
Yeah. Always were.
Right?
                Thank you.
            Well, I Don't know
            why everything
    Has to be such a production
        with this family.
    We didn't need
    to buy one.
    The basement's
    loaded with boxes.
            You Don't bring
            your own, mom.
But we did buy one.
We bought a box.
So it's over.
        It looked more like
        a shipping crate, but...
    Your father would
    have wanted a bag.
[dialing]
            Look, could we just
            try to act normal
            For the next 2 days?
                Would that be
                possible?
Does that include you,
Or are you just telling
everybody else what to do?
            Look, Don't cast me
            in the role
            Of crazed control
            freak, all right?
Then stop
auditioning for it.
                I just
                wanted to put
                My dead father
                in a nice box.
You want to put
everyone in a box--
        The ineffectual
        mother box,
    The struggling actor box.
            People put
            themselves in boxes.
            I just label them.
            Like the rebellious
            teenage lesbian box
            That you're still
            stuck in at 35.
            Stop it. Stop it!
Ladies.
            Don't start
            your shit with me!
        Don't tell me
        what not to say!
Aah! Something
is stuck to my tongue!
        Try not to worry
            so much.
Everything is gonna work out
        for you kids.
    And always remember
    to brush before bed.
        [screaming]
        Uh, guys...
    [P.A. Announcements]
            So, that was
            really lucky.
            You guys were
            right there, hmm?
        Yeah. Um...
It was lucky.
        Um, you guys.
                    Sam.
        Is she gonna
        be all right?
Um, she's...She's
gonna be fine.
She snapped
a few bones,
Mostly shoulder
and face,
A couple of ribs.
They slapped her
in a halfie.
        Oh, well, that's
        good, right?
                Can we see her?
    Not until she hardens,
And even then, it might not be
        a great idea.
    She might want to be
        left alone,
    Because usually people
    are kind of embarrassed
        After an accident
            like that.
It wasn't an accident.
        Well, it is
        what it is.
    So, why Don't you guys
            go home,
    And then I'll give you
            an update
    When I get off of work.
    Did she say anything
    before she jumped?
"brush your teeth."
    Oral hygiene freak.
        Lucy: Shh!
    I heard something.
                    Malice.
            Yeah, what ever
            happened to Alice?
Yeah. Who dumped her
in the bitch tank?
        [laughter]
She wasn't like this
when we were kids.
    Judy: Wait a second.
We're talking about Alice here?
Yeah. Alice was fun
and mischievous.
            We're talking about
            your sister Alice?
                    Yeah.
We had a dress code
in high school.
 We had to wear skirts,
 blouses, little vests.
And Alice talked a bunch
of girls, maybe 20,
Into protesting it,
so they come to school,
And they're wearing
jeans and hot pants,
 And the headmaster
 lost it.
He suspended them,
so the next week...
                    Next week?
What's next week?
                    Sweetie...
        [laughter]
You were
telling a story.
        Yeah, you were
        telling a story--
    Alice and the dress code.
Oh, god. We had
a dress code in high school.
We had to wear
these little uniforms--
            No, no.
        We got this part.
With the...With blouses
and things like this.
And Alice talked a bunch
of girls, maybe 20--
        Fast-forward.
And they come
to school
Wearing hot pants
and jeans.
And so the next week,
They come to the school
wearing the uniform,
But they had crew cuts.
        [both laughing]
            You weave
            quite a yarn.
    No. She was my hero.
        I'll have some.
You've had quite
enough, my darling.
    I Don't know if your
grandparents ever told you,
    But I used to go up there
        and hang out
    When you weren't around,
    Till your grandfather
    hit me with a rock.
                    Yeah.
You coming?
        He said he thought
        I was a crow.
            I was not
        his favorite person.
What am I gonna
say about him?
        What would you want
        people to say about you?
What could you say
about me?
            What would I say
            about you?
        When I die...
    I want to be cremated.
Oh, me, too.
                Yeah, me, too.
            I want you
        to take my ashes,
        And I want you
    to mix them with the ink
    That the government uses
        to print money.
        [laughter]
        Yes. And then
    I'll be everywhere.
        [laughter]
Mom said that dad
Wants us to put him
in his little rowboat.
I'm not kidding.
And light it on fire
And launch him
out to sea.
            Ha ha ha.
            Good thing he didn't
            want us to eat him.
    You know what I would say
        if he was here?
    I would say, "hey, dad.
    "hey, dad, you have
        another kid.
    "you have another kid.
        Remember me?
    Remember the skipper?"
        [deep voice]
        "oh, no. No.
        "that's my boy.
    That's my Danny boy.
        He's my boy,
        my Danny boy."
    Well, what about me?
    Look what I can do.
    Look what I stuck
    to my face, dad. Huh?
    Can I be your boy?
    Can I be your boy?
            I'm right
        in front of you!
            This is good shit.
                Oh, yeah.
            Oh, it's drizzling.
It's nice.
                Yeah. Yeah.
            You know, Sam,
            thanks.
            Thanks for helping
            us so much.
Oh, anything
for you, Alice.
                Oh, that's nice.
                All right.
Do you want to hear
something really pretty?
A song. I've been
listening to it.
                    Yeah. Ok.
On the way here.
                I still think
                this tree house
                Needs
                a second story.
That was one
of our better ideas.
            Who knew...
            That wood paneling
            Wouldn't make
            a solid floor?
                You know.
    Everybody.
                Yeah, exactly.
And they kept
telling us.
                    Yeah.
                We had a dream.
    We did.
    Ha ha ha.
                I still dream
                about you.
    [light rain falling]
        [thunder]
    [music playing on radio]
Hey, what ever happened
to that Guy
That you were
going with in college?
            Um...Oh, nothing.
    Mmm.
                Hey, Alice.
            You remember
            when your father
            Walked in on us
            in the basement?
Were we doing this?
    Kind of.
            Were we doing this?
                Um...Sort of.
    (music) come running to me (music)
        (music) when things get
        out of hand (music)
    [thunder rumbling]
        (music) run into me (music)
    (music) when it's more
    than you can stand (music)
    (music) I said I'm strong (music)
        What are you guys
        doing there?
Just looking.
                He's fogging up
                my window.
                    Stop.
        What is that?
    Ryan: We've got to
    go inside. Come on.
        Be careful.
        What are you guys
        looking at?
    That's Samantha's car.
I love you guys.
                Oh!
        Aah!
        [shouting]
    [alarm clock buzzing]
        [buzzing stops]
Good morning.
                I...
            You...Ha ha ha.
    Ok. Um...
    Is Alice up?
Are you leaving?
                Yes.
        Ok.
                        Morning.
    Morning.
                Morning.
                Where is she?
I Don't know.
        She didn't leave
        with Samantha?
    Morning.
        Morning.
                    Morning.
Where's, uh...
                We Don't know.
Well, did she leave--
    Skip: No, she didn't.
        I saw her get out
            of the car,
        And I saw her
    go towards the woods.
        And then she just
            became a...
        Tiny...Screaming...
Katie: I'm sorry.
There are only 2 hours
before the funeral,
And I really need
some help here.
        Skip: Are you
    dressing up for this?
Hey, hey, hey,
you guys.
Could one of you
please tell me
One nice thing I can say
about your dead father?
        He often called me
        Andrea for no reason.
I was Barry.
                Wait a minute.
                What about...
                Remember
                thanksgiving,
            And that crazy lady
            broke in the house?
    Yes, that woman
    with the red hair.
            Yep, yep,
            and remember.
            She took the leg
            off a turkey
            And started banging
            it on the table
        And screaming
        something about Easter?
That's...Easter.
That's right.
You remember
how cool dad was?
He leapt over the table,
swept her off her feet,
And carried her
out the front door.
    "he protected us."
        What else?
                Why Don't you...
                Read a passage
                 From <i>death</i>
                 <i>of a salesman?</i>
                    Ha.
        I Don't know any.
    I do.
Put up your hands.
Goddamn you!
Put up your hands. Ha.
What do you think you are,
better than everybody else?
        You Don't know
        everything!
    You Don't know, you big
    ignorant, stupid...
        Put...Put up
    your goddamn hands!
        Put up your hands.
    Attention must be paid.
        [doorbell rings]
        You ratted on us!
         You ratted on us.
        Skip: Shut up!
                    Hi, Katie.
Ryan.
How's your leg?
            It's...You know...
                Broken.
    I'm sorry.
            It's ok. Uh, here.
What's this?
            The answer
            to your question.
            Could we go inside
            and talk
            Before
            you read that?
It's kind of...
Crazy in there.
Could we maybe
meet tomorrow
Before I go back
to school or something?
                You Don't
                want me to...
                Come
                to the funeral?
    [sighs]
                I'm gonna go.
        Danny: Katie.
            Katie.
    What?
            Katie.
    What?
                Do you see
                my cell phone?
    No!
            [beeping]
        Uh!
                I knew you'd
                kill yourself
            If you missed your
            husband's funeral.
Mmm...Mmm...Mmm...
            Of course they're
            all gonna be there.
            Ok, you're ready.
    Mmm!
        Ok, here we go.
                    Mmm...
Yeah, I am hurrying.
                        Nurse.
Uh, I just have to get her
down to x-Ray stat.
                I didn't order
                any x-rays.
                    There.
                    And now...
    [imitating drum roll]
                Ta-da!
            And for you,
                A hat...
                And...
            It's a look. Ok.
            Let's run
            some lights.
    [organ playing softly]
                Touch him.
    You.
Looks like he's
gonna say something.
    "could somebody please
    scratch my nose?"
        [both laughing]
We're gonna need
more gas.
        I definitely Don't want
        to do this twice.
I'm just asking
everyone
To stop at my office
after this.
It's on the way
to the lake.
                    Sure.
        Katie, I'm
        just asking--
Did you invite
any of his coworkers?
    Well...Your grandfather
    was more of a family man.
So it's just us?
            Well, where's
            your grandmother?
You didn't hear?
    Grandma.
            What in the world
            happened?
Are you ok?
        Mmm...Mmm...
She said
she's fine.
        Mmm...Mmm...
She's happy
to be here.
I Don't know.
He looks different to me.
        [sighs]
It's hard to picture him
without a twinkle in his eye.
            He really loved you.
                He did.
        [sighs]
        Something stuck
        to my tongue.
            Nice touch.
    [parson clears throat]
    Bye, dad.
    [electronic feedback]
        [crying softly]
            Why...
    Do people have to die?
                    [sighs]
            I...
        I...I, uh...
    My uncle died recently.
        He was really...
        Really the one who...
            Rai...
        He raised me.
            [sobbing]
        Jimmy. Jimmy.
        Uncle Jimmy.
        Jiminy cricket.
    [stammering incoherently]
        [playing piano]
    (music) I am not in love (music)
        (music) but I'm open
        to persuasion (music)
        (music) east or west (music)
    (music) where's the best (music)
    (music) for romancing? (music)
Lucy: This is bullshit.
No. I'm sorry.
Screw her.
                Come on, Luce.
No. She has made a business
out of persecuting me.
And I'm supposed to sit here
at my father's funeral
And watch her
fuck-sing at Samantha?
Screw that.
        [Alice singing]
Jesus, Luce!
        What is wrong
        with this family?
                    Well...
                I hadn't heard
                Alice sing
                Since you were
                a baby.
        She had a little trouble
        with the high notes.
Is it too much to ask
that we bury my grandfather
With a little honor
and dignity?
                I think it is,
                sweetie, yeah.
        Lance: You all know
        how I felt about him.
        He was somebody
        I considered to be
        A very close
        personal friend.
        I have here
his last will and testament.
    He leaves his house
    at 132 rolling drive
To his beloved wife Charlotte.
    He leaves $1,000 cash
    to Kate for expenses.
        He also left
        a videotape
    That he instructed me
        to play for you.
                What about
                his money?
    He had no other assets.
        I'm sorry.
                You're sorry?
        Hello, everybody.
            Surprise!
            [sighs]
            Ha ha ha!
        Before I leave,
I just want to say good-bye
        And say a few
    other things as well.
        First, I'm not
        a salesman.
    Hell, I couldn't sell
nose plugs to a proctologist.
    I never did a day's work
        in my life.
        I never knew
    how to do anything,
        Except a little
        acting maybe.
    That's where my Danny boy
        got it from.
    There's something stuck
    to my tongue, too.
Of course, Jerry was the one
    with the film career.
        What I'm trying
        to tell you is...
    There were 3 of you.
                    He always
                    forgets me.
    One in Rhode Island,
        One in Mexico,
and one in South Carolina.
            Ha ha ha!
If you think raising 3 families
        is a lot of work,
        You try doing it
    Without letting them
find out about each other.
    Oh, that's a killer.
    Talk about leaking money.
    Ooh, when I was 20,
    I inherited millions,
        And now...I'm up
    to my prostate in debt.
        Ha ha! It was
        a crazy life,
        But I loved it...
        Because I love
    my 3 wonderful wives
    And my 9 Precious--
Lance on videotape: 11.
            11?
        [laughing]
    11 children? My god.
    No wonder I couldn't get
    your names straight.
        Anyway, I've had
        a great life.
                    Mmm!
        A full life...
        3 full lives.
        You should all be
            so lucky.
        Katie Collins,
    I'd like you to find
    My other 2 families
        And inform them
        of their loss.
                    Mmm!
    Remember, I was just
as big a part of their families
    As I was of yours.
If I've learned anything,
it's to be true to yourself.
                        Look it.
He clocked them.
All the way
from the grave.
    All this time, I thought
    you were his favorite.
    Well, I mean, you were
    his favorite one of us.
    We could have been
his second-favorite family.
                I left something
                in the...
    We could have been
        his third.
        Congratulations
    on the thousand bucks.
                    Thanks.
What makes you think
they know what they're doing?
    This is actually the kind
    of stuff they're good at.
Maybe we should watch
from over there.
        Yeah.
    (music) love is but a song
        we're singing (music)
    (music) fear's the way we die (music)
    [coughs]
                I never knew.
None of us did.
            No. I mean,
            I knew your family
            Was, you know...
            A little...
            But I had no idea.
        (music) though the bird
        is on the wing (music)
        (music) and you may not
            know why (music)
                You know, Sam,
                I think
                I'll catch up
                with you later.
                I'm gonna
                have a word
                With my brother
                there.
    Ok.
        (music) everybody
        get together (music)
    (music) try to love one another
        right now (music)
Dad, a little
assistance.
        Listen, guys...
    My pop never told me...
        He never told me...
        How much he--
                    Don't.
            What?
You were gonna
say the "l" word.
        I just want you
            to know--
Dad, we know
how you feel.
Don't cheapen it
with words.
    I Don't want to be
        like him.
So leave us
better instructions.
                Now, could you
                push?
        I love you guys.
        Dad!
                        Dad!
    I know. It felt weird,
        but I did it.
    The fuse!
            Oh, great.
No worries.
We came prepared.
            Oh, great.
[inhaling deeply]
            Hey, do you remember
            Harry Barnes?
Don't give me crap
about that.
I'm not in the mood.
I Don't want to--
            I'm not giving you
            crap about it.
            You remember him,
            right?
How could I forget him?
He tortured you.
"hey, here comes
peanut butter boy..."
Or crunchy-munchy face
or roasted-toasted...
            Yeah, I know.
            I just...I wanted...
    What?
             I just wanted
             to thank you.
            I just want to
            thank you for that.
            Thank you for
            looking after us,
                Protecting us.
                    Really.
                    [inhaling]
He had a glass jaw.
                    [laughing]
What? He did.
                    Glass jaw.
He did.
                You clobbered
                that kid.
    No.
                Yes. You had
            An unbelievable
            right hand, Alice.
                Alice, please.
                You dropped
                that boy.
                You did. You--
Ha ha ha!
Ow. That...
                    Ow!
            I Hope
            you hurt yourself.
            That really hurt.
            I can't remem--
            When was
            the last time
        That the 2 of us just
        hung out like this?
            I can't remember.
Lucy...I think
You owe your sister
a big apology.
            I Don't have
            a sister.
                Did we miss
                anything?
There's nothing
left to say.
He ended it all.
            Well, let me see
            what you got here.
            You want a twizzler?
            You sure?
    Mm-hmm.
I can remember the day
that you were born.
 I can. I remember
 the doctor coming in
And saying,
"it's a girl."
I thought, "finally,
a baby sister.
I'm gonna have a friend
for the rest of my life."
                    Friend?
        You've been making me
        feel bad about myself
        For the past 15 years.
I know. It wasn't
about you.
            Oh, I was there.
            It was all about me.
Well, maybe I thought
I was helping you.
                Maybe you
                didn't think.
    All right.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Lucy.
 I'm so sorry.
                    For what?
For not being
there for you,
 For not being
 on your side.
That's...I wasn't
on your side.
                Yeah. Well...
    Dad?
                    You ready,
                    sweetie?
    No.
            There's a lot
            of good stuff here.
            You know, just maybe
            skip the part
            About him being a
            salesman, you know.
                You ready?
    No.
            Uh, everybody.
            Can we gather?
    Katie's going to honor
    what's left of our father
        With a eulogy.
            Dad, lighter.
Be careful, guys.
I love this lighter.
        We Don't have
        a bagpipe player.
                    We know
                    the words.
    [twins imitating bagpipes]
    How many laws you suppose
    we're breaking here?
Yeah, I should be
preparing a defense.
    Um...We have gathered
        here today
    To honor my, uh...
Grandfather, Edmund Collins--
Shut it.
        [twins stop
    imitating bagpipes]
        Edmund was more
    than just a great father.
    He was a great...Guy.
Use your aim,
guys.
            Grandpa had
        the playful habit
        Of showering us
    with unusual nicknames.
    Grandpa protected us
    while he was off...
            [laughs]
        And even though
    he wasn't always around,
        Let's face it,
    more than anything,
    My grandfather was
        a family man.
        [Alice laughing]
        Sorry.
        [all laughing]
        Move me over there.
            Ha ha ha.
        What's so funny?
        Your father's dead.
    Maybe he wasn't the man
    we all thought he was,
        But he's the reason
        we're all here.
    So...Go ahead and laugh.
        He made me laugh.
            Just remember,
            This is the last
            Chance you have
            To say good-bye
            to your father.
            Katie, I gave you
            a job to do.
            Get over here.
            And just speak
            from your heart.
        [arrows continue
            splashing]
    All right, Katie.
        "did you really
        leave me again?
    "after all the seasons
        I spent waiting,
            "watching
        out the window,
    "listening at the door,
    "waiting for the news
        of your return,
        "for the news
        that you realized
    "that someone important
    was waiting for you?
    "a whole lifetime
    I've been waiting.
        "I can't believe
    you're not coming back.
"I can't believe I'm supposed
        to stop waiting.
        I can't believe
        you left me again."
    Grandpa didn't leave
        because of you.
    It was because of you
    that he kept coming back.
        I Hope you all
        realize that.
            [thud]
                Skip: Nice.
(music) papa was
a rolling Stone (music)
(music) wherever he laid his hat
        was his home (music)
    (music) and when he died (music)
        (music) all he left-- (music)
So, after it stopped
raining grandpa,
I caught a ride here.
                [sniffling]
            I'm so honored
            and touched.
        Thank you for
        sharing that with me.
I'm sorry.
            I had no idea.
            No wonder Edmund
            was gone so often.
It's hard to believe.
It really is.
                Poor Barbara.
What do you mean?
            I Don't know
            what to say.
You're not Barbara?
            Edmund was the best
            neighbor I ever had.
                [crying]
    Rod Stewart: (music) crying (music)
                    How'd it go?
    Oh...
Pretty well, I guess.
                I was starting
                to think maybe
                You ducked out
                the back on me
                Or something.
    Ha ha ha!
        (music) that's why I (music)
        (music) I Don't cry (music)
        (music) laughing (music)
(music) laughing sometimes does
somebody some good somehow (music)
        (music) somehow (music)
            Wait. Stop the car
            for a second.
        (music) that's why I (music)
    (music) I'm laughing now (music)
    (music) that's why I... (music)
I'll explain
on the way.
    (music) I'm laughing now (music)
        (music) loving (music)
    (music) loving never did me
        no good no how (music)
            (music) no how (music)
        (music) that's why I (music)
    (music) can't love you now (music)
        (music) that's why I (music)
    (music) can't love you now (music)
        "this tape will explain
        what this note cannot."
        [gunshots]
        "vag...In...
        A...Town."
        What's a vag?
    (music) you know I've never been
        much like you (music)
(music) and so whatever, I guess
we just can't compare the 2 (music)
    (music) and so you got to stay
        tried and true (music)
    (music) stick around for now,
    it's gonna be all right (music)
    (music) you've got the grace,
    and I've got the time (music)
        (music) you call me
        your revelation (music)
            (music) hold me
        in anticipation (music)
        (music) and all I got
        is a fascination (music)
        (music) for you (music)
    (music) I guess I kind of
    got lost in myself (music)
    (music) and what's ahead of me
        is better (music)
    (music) but it's not for me
            to tell (music)
    (music) I got a feeling
    it's just as well (music)
        (music) take a ride,
is what you see inside ok? (music)
    (music) and everything shines
    in the light of the day (music)
        (music) you call me
        your revelation (music)
        (music) for you (music)
        [applause]
    Alice: So, I think
that brings us to the toasts,
    And I think we should
        toast my sister
    And my new sister-in-law.
    So I think the lovely
    and articulate Simon
Will do the honors, right?
                Skip: Big skip.
            Big skip.
    Well, come and prove it.
        [applause]
    Thank you. Thank you.
    Well, here they are.
    We're here for these
        2 lovely ladies
On this momentous occasion.
        And we're all
        happy for them.
Oh. Oh, I have a perfect joke
    for tonight. Yes, I do.
        It's not dirty.
    It's not a dirty joke!
    It's not a dirty joke.
    Just let people have--
    It's a simple joke.
    These 2 gym teachers
walk into a hardware store--
                    That's it.
                    All right.
