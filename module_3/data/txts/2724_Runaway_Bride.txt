MAN: Fisher, pick up. Fisher, it's me.
Fisher, pick up.
I'm late, come on.
I need to bounce some ideas off you.
- Mine are all boring, done it, been there.
- Hey, Ike.
When are you guys gonna stop waking me up every morning?
- When your column stops putting me to sleep.
- Oh, funny, funny.
[MAN WHISTLES]
- Yo, Jonah!
- Fisher, come on. Are you really not there?
All right, cool. I'll talk to you later.
Excuse me. Uh, I'm thinking of doing
an article about limousines.
What do you think about people...
- ...who've never been in one?
- Sorry, I don't know people like that.
I just need someone to bounce some ideas
off of and get the juices flowing.
I got one hour, 27 minutes, 52 seconds.
When are you gonna put me in a column?
- When your T-shirts stop shrinking.
- WOMAN: Shrinks?
- Funny, funny. He's kidding. He's just kidding.
- Aw, forget it.
- Here, give me $5. Give me $2.
- WOMAN: No way.
Folks, I got nice shirts here. Look!
"I love everybody. You're next."
[<font color="#808080">♫ ALLURE'S <i>"YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE FOR ME"</i> PLAYING </font>]
I promise you that love won't be easy
I promise you there'll be times apart
When we're apart
But I swear that it comes from my heart
So, what's in store for us in tomorrow's column?
[SIGHS]
I don't know yet.
I'm kind of a last-minute man.
You know, until an hour or two
before deadline, I don't get any ideas.
WOMAN: So you get your ideas
for your column from life.
Start up a conversation with a woman in a bar,
attack her dart playing...
...and try to get a rise out of her
while you contemplate...
- ...whether or not she's worth hitting on.
- No, I can't hit on you until I get an idea.
Oh.
- That's flattering.
- IKE: No, no, you don't understand.
I understand. See, my not responding
to you baiting me...
...will inspire one of those bitter diatribes
you like to write about women.
IKE:
I don't write bitter diatribes about women.
- Oh, ho.
- Very often.
- I could.
- Heh. Only when the ideas aren't flowing, huh?
It's so nice to meet you, one-minute man.
- It's last-minute man.
- Whatever.
Wanna hear something funny?
For a good-looking guy...
...you strike out a lot.
Have you noticed that?
[PHONE RINGING]
- KEVIN: I bet it's your ex-wife.
- GEORGE: Excuse me.
I've seen much worse.
KEVIN:
No, Ike's not here.
I say, I've seen much worse.
- KEVIN: I'll tell him when he comes in.
- Excuse me?
The brush-off.
I've witnessed far more...
...treacherous and nefarious exits than that.
At least she castigated you in private.
Not as private as I thought.
Kevin, got some napkins there?
- Wiping or writing?
- I'll let you know.
They love you. They hate you.
They're hot. They're cold.
- They're high. They're low.
- They're up. They're down.
This is fun making a list with you,
but I do have a column to write.
- Ike.
- But you have yet to find a really superb idea.
There's a girl from my hometown
that you could write about.
Excuse me, but we don't need any ideas.
GEORGE:
She likes to dump grooms right at the altar.
They call her the "Runaway Bride."
She's performed the travesty seven or eight times.
Turns around, runs like hell. Bolts, adios.
Plows down the aisle,
knocking old ladies out of her way...
...like the running of the bulls in Pamplona.
And guess what!
She's got the next victim all lined up.
She's turning another body on the spit.
IKE:
Okay, Italics, here we go.
Today is a day of profound introspection.
I have been accused of using this column
to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex.
This uncomfortable accusation...
...has plunged me into at least 15 minutes
of serious reflection...
...from which I have emerged
with the conclusion...
...that, yes, I traffic in female stereotypes.
[SIGHS]
"But how can one blame me
when every time I step out my front door...
...I meet fresh proof that the female archetypes
are alive and well?
The mother, the virgin, the whore, the crone.
They're elbowing you in the subway, stealing your cabs...
...and overwhelming you
with perfume in elevators."
"But perhaps in fairness to the fairer sex...
...I do need to broaden my horizon and
add some new goddesses to the pantheon."
"I would like to nominate for deity, ah,
the cheerleader, the coed and the man-eater...
...the last of which
concerns me most today."
"In ancient Greece, this fearsome female
was known as Erinys...
...the devouring death goddess.
In India, she is Kali, who likes to devour
her boyfriend Shiva's entrails...
...while her yoni devours his--
Dot, dot, dot. Never mind.
In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater
is called Ragma."
You notice these are all countries without cable.
"And in Hale, Maryland...
...where she helps run
the family hardware store...
...she is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter,
a.k.a. the Runaway Bride."
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter...
...is that she likes to dress her men up
as grooms before she devours them."
One antique hot-water handle
with the "hot" still on it.
Guaranteed to fit any American Standard
cast-iron tub...
...with a four-inch center mount made
between 1924 and 1938.
In other words, Mr. Paxton, I think you are
out of the doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.
- Hallelujah!
- See you later. I'll put it on your charge.
You know, there's a possibility she hasn't seen this yet.
I mean, maybe she just hasn't
picked up a paper. Know what I mean?
- Or not.
- EARL: Maggie?
Earl, you don't need an air conditioner.
You need an attic fan.
There's more in the back, huh?
Hey.
What?
So, Mag, you've seen this, huh?
Yes, I've seen it.
And it is the rudest...
...most offensive...
...joke anyone has ever played on me!
You guys, how long did this take you?
Where did you get it done?
You're both creeps, by the way.
I should disinvite you.
Maggie, you told us no bachelorette jokes,
so we didn't....
Holy moly.
- Bag. Bag.
- PRESSMAN: She's going. She's gonna go.
PEGGY:
Here's the bag. Breathe!
[GRUNTING]
[BARKS]
MAN [ON RADIO]: And on the local front,
our town of Hale, Maryland...
...is still buzzing about
the less-than-flattering article...
...about their native daughter
Maggie Carpenter.
Her bridal exploits were taken to task by
New York columnist Ike Graham in USA Today.
Mr. Graham called her--
MAGGIE:
Dear editor, greetings from the sticks.
Perhaps you believe that a rural education
is focused mainly...
...on hog calling and tractor maintenance
rather than reading.
Why else would you print a piece
of fiction about me and call it fact?
I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy
thinking up slanderous statements...
...about how I dump men for kicks to bother
with something silly like accuracy in reporting.
Which is understandable,
because with a man-eater like me on the loose...
...who has time to check facts?
- Frances, lunch today?
- No, I'm going to the bank.
- IKE: Sure?
- Sorry, Ike.
All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- I'm gonna put in a good word for you.
- No, don't mention my name.
MAGGIE: That's why I was surprised
to find Mr. Graham's editor was a woman.
Call me a sentimental fool,
but I hoped we man-eaters could stick together.
"Anyway, just dropping you big-city folk
this little note...
...to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice
that would satisfy my current appetite:
Ike Graham's column on a platter.
- Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter.
- Heh.
P.S. I have enclosed a list of the gross
factual misrepresentations in your article.
There are 15."
IKE:
Funny. I like her.
- She's got spunk.
- ELLIE: Ike, look.
She sent us this list.
Our lawyers say it's actionable.
[SIGHS]
I left you four messages.
You don't return my calls.
So? I never returned your calls,
even when we were married.
What's Fisher doing here?
Oh, Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
IKE:
Since when does Ellie need moral support?
It's for you, Ike.
What? What?
Journalism lesson number one:
If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
Lesson number two:
Never work for your former spouse.
That has nothing to do with it.
You cooked this story up, and you know it!
I did not cook anything up. I had a source.
Someone reliable?
Some boozehound in a bar?
In vino veritas.
Hey, hey, hey. Don't knock drunk guys in bars.
It means they're not driving.
Besides, I am a columnist.
This is what columnists are supposed to do.
It's what you like.
We push, we stretch, we go out on a limb.
That's what makes me good.
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
[IKE SIGHS]
All right. Let's consider that
my wrist has been slapped.
There. Slap it. Go ahead, just--
Slap my wrist. That's done.
Just give me a call when you feel
that I've served my time, and move on.
This is permanent, Ike.
If you go quietly, I'll get you severance pay.
ELAINE:
I'm sorry, Ike.
[TRAIN HORN BLARING]
- MAGGIE: Bob? Honey?
- BOB: In the kitchen!
Honey, she canned him! Honey?
Bob, she canned him!
- Yeah! What are you talking about?
- Listen, it's in the paper.
- Try this on first.
- Okay.
- I wanna read it to you, so come over this way.
- Okay.
Ready? "Dear Maggie Carpenter:
I apologize to you
for this unfortunate matter."
Here it is. "Ike Graham's column will no longer
be appearing in this paper.
Best of luck in your upcoming marriage."
Okay, this is the weight of the pack
you'll carry in the Himalayas.
- You let me know if it's too heavy.
- Okay.
Whoa. Aah!
- A little, yeah. Yeah, a little heavy, baby.
- Ha, ha.

I'm doing a photo spread for GQ

Meet me. I'll save your tush.
Since I do freelance stuff for GQ now, I have an idea.
What are you saying?
Vindication. How would you like some?
A chance to prove that although your story
wasn't entirely factual, your theory was correct.
- The real story on Miss Carpenter.
- All the gory details.
IKE:
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
FISHER:
And if she runs again, you got a cover story.
Here you go. Right upstairs to the left.

Stop. When you talk like that...
- ...it turns me on and frightens me.
- Oh, you turn a girl's head.
Whoa, ho, ho ho!
Excuse me. Hello?
Excuse me. Could you help--?
I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.
There was a note on the door
of the hardware store across the street.
- Are you a reporter?
- Heh. What?
It's just been our experience that anyone
who comes in here with tassels on his loafers...
...is a big-city reporter
wanting to do an interview with Maggie.
Mm-hm.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Actually, about her getting that asshole
from New York fired.
I am just such a reporter. And who are you?
- Peggy Flemming. Not the ice skater.
Ah.
- PEGGY: Come in, come in.
- IKE: Oh, thank you.
And who are these lovely ladies?
- Hi, I'm Cindy, Maggie's unmarried cousin.
- IKE: Hello.
Mrs. Pressman. No relation. Oh, sorry.
- IKE: Uh-huh.
- PEGGY: And you are?
Looking for Maggie.
Maggie, someone to see you.
Oh.
I hope you've got a new angle,
because it's all pretty much been covered.
Hold on. No one interviews Maggie
in here without a haircut.
Sorry, no. Just got one.
PRESSMAN:
Excuse me, sir, I have a fact for you.
- This is an actual fact.
- IKE: Yes, Mrs. Pressman?
This is actually her fourth wedding...
- ...not seventh like they said.
- IKE: I know, but tell me something.
Do you think she's gonna make it all the way this time?
PRESSMAN:
I don't know.
[PEGGY GASPS]
She swallowed her gum, heh. She does that.
[IKE CLEARS THROAT]
PRESSMAN: Mr. Schulian, he runs
the newsstand. He's also our local bookie.
- IKE: Ah, yes, yes.
- PRESSMAN: He's given 8-to-1 odds she won't.
Okay.
Instead of a haircut, how about a wash?
Get all that city grit out of your hair.
- Hmm. You'll answer my questions?
- MAGGIE: Mm-hm.
Fine. You wash, I'll ask.
So, ahem, what do you wanna know?
Uh, when is the big day?
- MAGGIE: A week from Sunday.
- PEGGY: Let's put this, um, up here like this...
...because this aromatherapy
can get a little strong.
The lavender, we don't want to put you to sleep.
- IKE: Hmm. You nervous?
- Never been more certain of anything in my life.
Except I've been having all kinds of weird dreams.
IKE:
Oh? Would you like to tell me about them?
MAGGIE:
Uh, yeah, sure.
- MAGGIE: And another one.
- Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.
MAGGIE: I go inside the church
and everyone I know is there.
And the creepiest part is I look down at my dress...
- IKE: Hmm.
- ...and it's red.
I don't know what that means.
Red is not my color.
What do you think?
- IKE: I think you'd look good in red.
- No, no.
She means about your hair.
[PEGGY CHUCKLES]
IKE:
My jacket, please.
Thank you.
Excuse me, sir. Do you know where I can get
some shampoo? Some strong shampoo?
Doc's Pharmacy. Third and Elm.
Tell them Pete sent you.
You want my hat?
No, no, I'm fine. You might need it.
Mr. Graham, if you're looking
for Elm Street, it's that way.
IKE:
Thank you.
If you came down here in the pursuit
of happiness, you might as well go back.
You can't make me feel bad.
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm here for vindication.
In my heart, I feel I'm right about you.
Hmm.
You got me fired, lady.
You destroyed my reputation, and you screwed up my hair.
You chew up men, spit them out and love it.
You're gonna do the same thing to
this poor shmuck number four...
...that you did to the previous three.
You're gonna run again.
And I'm not leaving until you do.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I still have my job, heh.
Hey, kid, kid, kid, wait a minute.
- Give you 10 bucks for the hat.
- BOY: Sure.
That's right.
[SIGHS]
BOB: Ha-ha-ha.
I'm telling you, that is a photo opportunity.
When I only see one dog,
I know I've had too much to drink.
[CHUCKLES]
Hey, you'll never guess...
...who came crawling into town
with his tail between his legs.
IKE:
Who?
Hello, Maggie.
I just came over to apologize to your family.
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
I pushed a story. I made a mistake.
In other words, he's only human.
And he brought us a bottle of wine.
- They made me put my hat back on.
- It scared the hell out of Skipper.
[BARKS]
- WALTER: Ha, ha.
- You've gotta be kidding me.
No. You should've seen Skipper.
He was like, "Rah! Rah" Ha, ha.
[YELPS THEN BARKS]
[CHUCKLES]
It wasn't that funny.
MAGGIE:
Mm-hm.
Actually, it's been quite amusing.
Walter here has been sharing
his father-of-the-bride wedding memories.
Know what?
I think I'll take this to the kitchen.
I'll help you bring it in to the kitchen.
- Check on the crabs, Bob.
- BOB: Okay.
- [WHISPERS] Is he staying for dinner?
- BOB: I don't know.
I hope they don't have a fight.
You don't think they'd call it off, do you?
Wedding cake freezes. This we know. Heh.
- You know, your daughter is such--
- Ah! Oh, I'm sorry.
No, no, no, that's all right, Grandma.
That's fine. That's fine.
- She's such a lovely girl.
- Yeah.
Well, like her mother. Look.
May she rest in peace.
We were all so proud of Maggie when she was in school.
She won that American Legion scholarship to college.
She studied industrial design.
IKE: I can't see her leaving
multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Oh, yes, you can. She's got it all on tape.
- Tape?
- Yeah, they're all right there.
- You got tapes of the wedding?
- Lee at the hotel videos weddings.
Oh.
WALTER: Course, Maggie didn't know
she was gonna be running the 100-yard dash.
I gotta say this for my daughter,
she makes real good time.
IKE:
Bingo.
Maggie may not be Hale's longest-running
joke, but she is certainly the fastest. Ha, ha.
Ha, ha.
Maggie's mom and I were only blessed
with one child, not for a lack of trying.
This is good, Dad. Don't leave anything out.
WALTER:
I frankly consider it a bonus...
[DOG BARKS]
...that I'm actually able to plan
and, uh, pay for so many weddings.
Not this one. This one's on me.
Oh, that's fair.
I don't do it on purpose, despite what you may think.
- And I have no intention of doing it again.
- Right, just keep your eye on the ball.
MAGGIE:
Mm-hm.
Sports psychology.
Bob is the, um, head of the P.E. Department
at the high school.
And he coaches the football team.
And he's climbed Everest.
- Everest?
- MAGGIE: Twice.
- This true?
- Without oxygen.
- My girl, she likes to brag about me.
- MAGGIE: I do.
BOB:
Maggie's training for our wedding night.
I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna for our honeymoon.
- Oh, how romantic.
- We think so.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed
with two Sherpas and a yak.

Hey, Ike, how's it going?
You won't believe what I'm looking at here.
I got a video, heh...

I've been having bad thoughts.
Really bad thoughts.
- Of an impure nature?

- It won't take long. Just two venials.
- Okay.
Um, just respectful things.
What kind of music did you like?
What did we have in common back then?
Did you ruin my life when you left me at the altar?
Oh.
What did you say?
I said, you know, how could I be angry...
...when this is clearly as God intended
for it to be for me?
Good one. Thanks.
But, actually, it's really, really how I feel.
Of course. God, yes. Not God.
Uh, I'm sorry. I better go.
The man is a lunatic, but I think I know
exactly where he's going next.
God bless.
Oh, purse. Heh.
Forgot my purse.
Um, hi, hi, sorry. Purse. Good luck.
What was the one ridiculous question that he asked?
Oh, he wanted to know how you liked your eggs.
Oh.
Weird. Like a person's gonna remember
after all this time.
Scrambled with salt, pepper and dill.
Same as me.
I'm sorry I hurt you, Brian.
Maggie, I'm happy now here.
It's where I'm supposed to be.
But if you ever do decide to become a Catholic,
will you do me this favor?
Confess to Father Patrick.
Of course.
- MAGGIE: Gill? Lydia?
- Mags!
Hey, look, the tape. Remember?
Radio City Music Hall concert when Jerry was on ripple...
- ...and I'm going like, "Dude, let me jam."
- Uh, Gill, listen--
I'll play it for you.
You remember. You were there.
Can you focus on me?
There's this reporter who's making my life a living hell.
- Okay.
- And whatever you do...
...do not show him that picture of me
from the concert in San Francisco.
Okay? Can you--?
[IKE LAUGHING]
- What is that? Huh?
- Uh....
San Francisco? But we went a few times.
There's a lot of pictures.
Which picture? Because one time
we had a flat tire. Remember?
IKE:
Imagine!
Maggie Carpenter topless
in a public arena. Hmm.
Oh, yeah. I see it was a very chilly evening.
Mm-hm.
What's really interesting about this, though...
...is that you can't see that rose tattoo
on your back.
Heh. Oh, yeah. Ike bet me 50 bucks
that you don't still have it.
I said, "You're on, man.
Maggie loved that thing."
And, Maggie, seriously, I mean, I could use 50 bucks.
IKE:
Mm-hm.
GILL:
Maggie?
Just--
[MAGGIE CHUCKLES]
Look, I'm not gonna show you guys anything.
I am a soon-to-be-married woman.
- So just give me the photograph.
- IKE: I would love to give you this.
Believe me, I would.
Just give us a quick gander at that rose...
...and I'll gladly turn it over to you.
Fine. Heh. Fine. Okay, fine.
- Okay? All right? Ahem. Satisfied?
- IKE: Completely.
- Maggie, you got it removed?
Ahh. Gill--
Gill, I'll go you double or nothing
it was a stick-on.
Maggie?
[MAGGIE SCOFFS]
Gill, I am, uh, really, really...
...afraid of needles.
- But that doesn't make me a bad person.
- Look.
Look. Look.
I think this man is heartbroken.
- No, he's not.
- GILL: I think I am.
MAGGIE:
No, you're not.
You have your guitar, and you have Lydia.
You're not--
[STRUMMING]
MAGGIE:
We'll talk about this later, okay?
GILL:
Hey, Ike?
- What would Jerry do?
- IKE: He'd play.
- Jerry would play.
- He would play.
[PLAYING BLUES MUSIC]
PEGGY:
Wow, there's Ike...
...with the mayor and the police chief.
Boy, he sure makes friends easy.
That's pretty cool.

- That's right!
- KENDALL: Hey, you're that reporter, right?
- Yeah.
There he is again.
Snoop Doggy Dogg.
- KENDALL: I'm going to marry Maggie someday.
- Oh, really?
He's an attractive man.
The vicious reporter is attractive?
You're saying viciousness is attractive?
- No, I'm not saying viciousness is attractive.
- That's very telling.
[CROWD CHEERING]
MAGGIE:
You think-- Oh. Okay, he's coming.
- I better go--
- No, no, no. Don't leave, don't leave. Uh--
- Okay, act natural.
- Okay.
Um, he can probably read lips.
Hey, the famous Swenson triplets.
Give me 15. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well done.
- I will handle this.
- Don't move your lips! Okay? Go on.
- I will handle this. I won't say anything.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- I'll handle it.
Yeah, Cory!
- Hey, Peggy Flemming.
- Hey.
- Not the ice skater.
- Hey, that's Maggie's seat.
Yes, and this must be her beer too. Mm.
- CORY: Hey!
- Hey, sweetie!
IKE:
That your husband out here?
- Yeah.
- This is Cory? Cory Flemming?
- He's a radio announcer here, isn't he?
- Yeah, that's right.
Have you heard his morning show, Wake Up With Flemm?
Not yet.
WOMAN:
Now up, Atlantic Hotel's Lee Mistlehorne.
- He actually made the all-stars in high school.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You must be proud of him.
Well, I didn't really know him back then.
I mean, he was actually dating Maggie...
...at the time.
I mean, he never really--
They were never gonna get engaged
or anything, it was just like....
Sometimes he'd call her Magpie
and it was really irritating.
- IKE: Magpie.
- But, uh--
- I don't know why I'm telling you this.
- IKE: No, this is good.
- He's stealing third!
- Yes!
Excellent.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Whoo!
Safe!
I love it!
[ALL CHEERING]
- Good one!
- Magpie!
Just--
Excellent!
It's nice that, uh, they're still friends.
Yeah, I mean, that was just a long time ago.
And, you know, it's just--
So-- Excuse me.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
WOMAN:
That makes it alumni 9, Hale students 8.

- Hey!
WOMAN: Cookies for today's game
were donated by Betty Trout.
Now up for the Comets, Jordan Hill.
You have been here, what, three minutes?
What did you do to her?
- You could just turn that finger around.
- Excuse me?
"Oh, Cory, Cory, Cory!" Pow, pow, pow.
What is that? What is this about?
You know what?
We have all been friends our entire lives.
[IKE SCOFFS]
A type of relationship that you obviously
don't understand.
I'm not the only one who does not understand.
The U.S.S. Maggie leaves quite a wake.
Excuse me.
[SCOFFS]
Pot-stirrer man.
WOMAN: Cory Flemming
to Lee Mistlehorne to Dr. Ettinger.
Hey. All right.
That's cheering. I'm cheering normal.
Cheer normal.
- WOMAN: Good morning, Peggy.
- PEGGY: Good morning.
[HUMMING]
MAGGIE:
Do you think I flirt with Cory?
Good morning to you too. You look good.
MAGGIE:
Thank you.
Do you think I flirt with Cory?
- Yes.
- I don't mean to.
I know. I think sometimes you just sort of...
...spaz out with excess flirtatious energy...
...and it just lands
on anything male that moves.
Anything male that moves?
As opposed to anything male that doesn't?
Well, like certain kinds of coral.
- I'm definitely gonna have to kill myself today.
- Why?
Because you think I'm all like,
"Hey, man, check me out."
No, I don't. I think you're like:
"I'm charming and mysterious
in a way that even I don't understand...
...and something about me is crying out
for protection from a big man like you."
It's very hard to compete with.
Especially as married women who've lost our mystery.
Lost-- You haven't--
You are totally mysterious.
No, I'm weird.
Weird and mysterious are two very different things.
- I'm weird.
- No, you're quirky.
Quirky and weird are two very different things.
Peggy, I think there is a distinct possibility...
...that I am profoundly
and irreversibly screwed up.
Despite that...
...I love you and I promise...
...to no longer flirt with Cory.
Maggie, I'm not worried about you and Cory,
or me and Cory...
...or you being irreversibly screwed up.
Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.
And all I'm thinking is, now that you're aware of it...
...and that it hurts
people's feelings sometimes...
...maybe it's time to get on with life
and commit to someone of your own...
...like Bob, if he's the one.
I know.
Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
Well, there's always the thing
that brings warmth to my heart...
...and that is duckbill platypus.
Duckbill-- That is only funny in, like,
Camp Birchwood on a--
- Just do it.
- A trip with the tent and my leg as the pole...
...and it's raining and--
You know, that's the only time that's funny.
Let's just see.
Oh.
[PEGGY LAUGHING]

It's so humiliating.
Thank you.

Hi. Give me the key to the reporter's room.
I wanna snoop around.

Thank you.
- Don't take anything big.
- MAGGIE: Okay.
Shh.
Hmm.
Hopefully his favorite.
FISHER [OVER PHONE]:
You know, my theory is that she's running...
...because she gets negative attention.
And negative attention is attention.
Like when women whack you on the street...
...because of your column.
That's negative attention.
We're talking about her negative attention, not mine.
"How does she get all those guys to propose?
She's not that beautiful."
[SCOFFS]
Bite me, paperboy.
Aw.
Hey, hey.
- Hi, Ike.
- IKE: Hey.
You put your shoes out at night,
they're real shiny in the morning.
- Sometimes they don't bring them back.
- Hmm. Why take a chance?
IKE:
Good night.
All right. I know you're in there. I saw you.
[GRUNTS]
You realize you're messing with the First Amendment now.
Come on, open up.
Come on.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
We should have a very serious discussion
about why you are such a pain in the ass!
Now open the door!
All right, I'm coming in. I'm coming through.
It's your last chance. Here I come!
Here I come! Here I come!
All right.
Breaking and entering. That's a felony.
I'm calling the sheriff.
You know what? You do that.
Can you remind him that
he's bringing the wine to the luau?
Save me a call. Thanks so much.
[SCOFFS]
Hey, Ike, does your friend have a sister?
Wait for the original.
She'll be available in a week.

Freeze. Oh, hold on to those covers.
I didn't come here to see Ike Junior.
[SIGHS]
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
- Your notes made for, um, interesting reading.
- What's your point?
Point is, once again, you're getting it all wrong.
That won't improve your reputation.
It's not very flattering to me either.
So I decided that I would help you write the truth.
- Heh. Really?
- Mm-hm.
Oh.
I've decided to cooperate and let you interview me...
...for 1000 bucks.
[IKE CLEARS THROAT]
I want a big wedding and a killer dress,
and for a grand...
...I will answer all your questions
and let you follow me around.
The magazine does not spend money for stories.
It's not what you would call ethical.
Oh. No, I meant you. I figured you probably
got severance or expenses or both.
I'm guessing that you're writing on spec.
And with a first-person interview,
you might actually sell that thing.
- Too much.
- Seven-fifty.
- Five hundred.
- Six-fifty.
Done.

Is that supposed to be a joke or something?
I know what you're whistling.
- Hello.
- Hi.
[IKE CHUCKLES]
MAGGIE:
This is a birthday present for my cousin.
Ha, ha. That's great.
Wonderful stuff. All these found
industrial parts and things.
A lamp tree.
That's great.
- Is this--? That's your preferred logo?
- I think so.
It's nice. The whole thing is great.
I think you could sell these lamps in New York.
Maybe someday. Hmm.
- You afraid to try?
- No, no, no. I'm not afraid.
Just someday.
This is Brian.
Oh, Father Brian.
- And Gill's, of course.
- Gill, yeah.
MAGGIE:
And George.
He proposed at a butterfly farm in Saint Thomas.
The ring was inside a cocoon.
Ugh. A little too Silence of the Lambs
for my taste, but--
Well, he's an entomologist.
I thought it was very unique.
- And finally, Bob.
- Hmm.
He proposed during
the seventh-inning stretch...
...at an Oriole game.
Wait, wait. Wait, don't tell me.
The scoreboard lit up with
"Marry me, Maggie."
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?
It was incredibly romantic.
Look, maybe it's just me...
...but if you gotta dress it up like that,
it just doesn't ring true.
You know, I think the most
that anybody can honestly say is:
"Look, I guarantee that there'll be tough times.
I guarantee that at some point...
...one or both of us is gonna want
to get out of this thing.
But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine...
...I'll regret it the rest of my life...
...because I know in my heart...
...you're the only one for me."
I like it.
I'd like it better on a scoreboard. Heh.
So is that what you said
when you asked your wife to marry you?
Oh, don't look so surprised.
You've got "divorce" written all over you.
I'm a work in progress.
So is that what you said to her?
No, I think I said something very eloquent like:
"So, um...
...maybe you and I should, you know--
What do you think, huh?"
[CHUCKLES]
Now, that's romantic.
And with a proposal like that,
you didn't find eternal bliss?
What went wrong?
I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No.
Maybe you should ask her sometime.
Ever thought of that?
[CHUCKLES]
MAGGIE: Even with everything that's happened,
I have still never been married.
And I still deserve a beautiful dress.
- Mrs. Whittenmeyer?
- WOMAN: Where are you going?
- MAGGIE: Oh, hi, Polly.
- WOMAN: Oh, hi, Maggie.
You have to excuse her.
Some of the children are afraid of you
since you dragged that little boy up the aisle.
Drag? No, I didn't--
No, he tripped on his own shoelaces.
WHITTENMEYER: You've come for your dress.
Good. It's in the back. I'll get it.
Actually, Mrs. Whittenmeyer, I decided...
...that I want to get this dress.
Oh. The one you have on hold
is lovely, dear.
No, I know, but I've just--
I've changed my mind.
This is $1,000.
And I have $1,000.
WHITTENMEYER:
The other one is only 300, dear.
Uh, um....
Is that dress for sale?
It's just a lot of money to spend on
one of your dresses, Maggie.
After all, you only wear them for about ten minutes or so.
Um, yeah, yeah. I guess that's true.
Uh....
The other dress is nice.
- IKE: Mrs. Whittenheimer?
- WHITTENMEYER: Meyer.
Whittenmeyer.
Could I talk to you just for a second?
Come here. I don't know much about
this kind of thing. I'm from out of town.
But you're a salesperson, right?
You're here to sell wedding dresses.
- Well, I've been here 30 years.
- Perfect!
Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.
Ah. But not just any one.
She wants that one.
- It's $1,000.
- IKE: Uh, listen, Aunt Bee.
Verbal communication was never perfect
for me. Let's try visual, all right?
We're buying the dress.
Now, we'll have this nice beautiful dress.
And anything else she wants, it's hers.
Okay? All right?
What do you think?
Hmm?
You look....
You look fine.
Fine.
[CLEARS THROAT]
You're reading your newspaper upside down.
That's gotta be better than "fine."
Yeah.
Hey, come on, now. Admire me.
Get the whole picture. Right? Picture it.
I'm gonna have my hair up somehow.
I don't know. Maybe with a little in the back.
And my favorite feature...
...is that it kind of swishes
like a bell when I move.
Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding.
It works.
Bob will be very happy.
Oh, Bob. Oh. We gotta go.
We gotta go meet Bob.
PRESSMAN: Oh, yeah, I'm going to the luau.
I never miss it. The barbershop quartet--
Mrs. Pressman,
we're ready to order here, I think.
- I'm all out of the special--
- That's all right.
- I'll have the garden omelet, egg whites only.
- PRESSMAN: Okay.
- Mm. That sounds good. I'll have the same.
- Of course.
What is that? I can't even order eggs
without sarcasm from you?
[CLEARS THROAT]
- Neutral corners. You're on the same team.
- What's that sound? "Ahem."
- Have some water.
- Penalty box.
- What is it? Fur ball? Ugh.
- Penalty box. Penalty box.
Ike, Maggie is the sweetest person you're ever gonna meet.
But she focuses too much out there.
She needs to start focusing more in here.
I mean, that's why I think she's had, uh....
Whatever you wanna call them.
Problems in the past.
And that's what we're working on. Focus.
Focus. Focus on Maggie.
Focus on Maggie. Mm-hm.
Focus on Bob. Focus on Bob.
I've been running Maggie through visualization exercises.
All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.
Um, visualize the end zone.
Visualize that hole-in-one.
Tell me. When you get to the altar,
do you spike the bouquet?
- Okay, you know what--
- Well, I'm off.
A reporter's work is never done.
See you later.
Bye, Mrs. Pressman. Thank you.
PRESSMAN:
I'm gonna go focus on your eggs, Bob.
GRANDMA: I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to try to explain.
There are reasons why there have been
three weddings and no "I do's."
Oh, you can't believe how much cake we got stuck with.
It's a wonder I don't weigh 300 pounds.
And then her father bought all that booze
that nobody drank.
- But he didn't mind that--
- Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Netta.
Grammy here was giving me the skinny
on why you run from marital bliss.
Right. Netta, cover up your ears.
It's not that she's afraid of the wedding.
- She's afraid of the wedding night.
- Hmm.
Innocent girls are terrified
of the one-eyed snake.
Why, when I was a virgin bride,
I took a knitting needle to bed with me.
Uh, ahem.
Grandma, I charmed the one-eyed snake
a while ago.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.
- MAGGIE: Oh, yeah. Heh.
GRANDMA: Well, I'll tell you one thing.
Your grandpa never forgot that wedding night.
Netta, you can take your hands down.
- The tea's cold.
- Good.
Could you excuse us for a minute?
May I have a word with you, please?
Uh-huh. Bye, Netta. Bye. Thanks, Grammy.
MAGGIE:
Uh, ahem.
I found this, and I didn't know
if it was something interesting.
- My-- This is Miles Davis.
- MAGGIE: Oh, I was cleaning out the attic and--
This is amaz--
This is very hard to find in good condition.
- You hold on to this. This is incredible.
- Why don't you take it, hmm?
- Huh?
- Take it.

You're not trying to butter me up, are you?

No, forget about it.
Don't even think about it.
I'm just so tired of this whole scene.
Why don't you just let him sleep it off here in the truck?
Come for a ride with me, come back for him later.
Okay.
MAGGIE: Well, he's been drinking more
and more since my mom passed away.
IKE: So that's when you quit school
to come back here?
MAGGIE:
Yeah. I had to come run the store for my dad.
IKE:
Well, my dad had a small printing business.
He wanted me to become a classical musician.
My mother wanted me to be a novelist.
They were 0-for-2.
More?
So, I, um, became a reporter.
Not quite a novelist, but as we all know,
journalism is literature in a hurry.

Whoa.
MAGGIE: This car takes unleaded.
Your filter is clogged.

Can you fix it?

- Oh, good.
Kind of isolated here.
Yeah, it's nice.
Well, if there's one thing us New Yorkers
know how to do, that's hail a cab.
If there's no cab, we walk.
Uh, well, if we saved the battery here, um...
...there's a place just down the way.
We country girls cut across the field.
It's quicker.
Oh, be careful of snakes.
- What?
- Snakes.
- I don't like snakes.
- Walk nice. They won't get you.

Come on, come on, come on.
MAGGIE: What are you--?
What are you doing? Snake dance?
IKE:
I'm scaring the snakes.
- MAGGIE: You're scaring me.
- Ha, ha. I'm scaring myself.
Do you think there's one right person for everybody?
[IKE SIGHS]
No, but I think attraction
is too often mistaken for rightness.
Attraction is very misleading.
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.
- And it doesn't mean anything.
- No.
No, no. It doesn't mean anything. It means--
I, uh...
...suddenly forgot how to climb a fence, heh.
- Tools.
- Tools. Yeah.
[MAGGIE CLEARS THROAT]
- Lionel, do you have tools?
- LIONEL: Hey, Maggie!
What are you gonna do?
Bust out of another wedding?
[IKE CHUCKLES]
IKE:
Sure are well known around here.
IKE: No, Fish, it's almost done. I swear.
This story's taken a very interesting turn.
I've got one more interview to do
up in New York. I'll see you later.
You could've told me that you were Fiancé Number 3.
And end up in the papers?
I've been humiliated enough already
to last a lifetime. Thank you.
I was traveling around...
...studying the reproductive
and migratory patterns of locusts...
...when Maggie met me.
Tell me, George, why do you think she ran?
Just like you said. What did you call her?
A man-eater?
Devouring death goddess, heh, right?
That's what I said.
I don't think that's why she ran.
- Why do you think she ran?
- I don't know. I'm working on it.
- I was on the wrong track.
- GEORGE: Are you defending her?
No, no, no.
I call it like I see it, that's all.
I'm a journalist. I'm a truth-teller.
- Unbelievable.
- What?
She got to you too, like a moth to a flame.
- Please.
- GEORGE: Join the club.
- What are you talking about?
- You need this much more than I do.
- I am a journalist. I'm doing an article.
- Heh, heh.
IKE:
Look. See? See? I'm being paid.
This will be published. It's a cover story.
You'll get all the facts in the article.
Do you know what kind of eggs she liked?
Poached, same as me.

An overpriced apartment and Chinese takeout.
- That's New York living.
- Fisher, don't forget the fortune cookies.

Walter, I'm thinking about going back to my maiden name.
Can you still remember it?
What? It's nice, you know.
It's just I haven't seen him in 24 hours, and I would...

You got something without a toy in it?
[UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING]
- MAN: Get down, Sprout.
- BETTY: The next three.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm hearing it here.
Aloha.
That's a very fetching headdress you're wearing.
Where did--? Where did you disappear to?
Missed me bad, huh?
BETTY:
And we have a winner right here!
PEGGY:
Yeah! All right, Bob!
Well, it's chow time here on the islands...
...and we Trouts have prepared
our traditional feast, shrimp trout.
So let's all meet over at the tables.
- You're not allergic to shrimp, are you?
- Mm-mm, no.
Oh, pity.
Attention! Pay attention to Walter.
Listen closely. He slurs.

over the years, it is now toast time.

How's that stomach there, buddy?
WALTER: Maggie may not be Hale's
longest-running joke...
- ...but she is certainly the fastest.
- [MOUTHS] But she is certainly the fastest.
Good one, Dad.
Uncle Walter, maybe Mr. Graham
will say something.
Oh, here we are. Would you like
to say something, Mr. Graham?
Yeah, just a minute, just a minute.
I don't know yet. You okay?
Come on, Ike, take a shot at Maggie live.
It's more fun than print.
Excuse me?
Well, it's a joke. They're kidding, Ike.
- Yeah, come on. Come on, let's go.
- Come on.
All right. We'll have a toast!
- Yeah!
- MAN 3: Come on!
To Maggie's family and friends.
May you find yourselves...
...the bull's-eye of an easy target.
May you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices...
...and may your noses be rubbed
in all of your mistakes.
Well, that was funny, but enough toasting.
Let's hula.
Everybody. Let's get up and--
Uh, start the band. Up, everybody.
We're gonna make a line right down here, everybody.
Maggie. Maggie?
BETTY:
Lou, where are those hula dancers?
- Here. She might need this.
- BETTY: Everybody gets a hula lesson.
- Where'd Maggie go to?
- She went to get me something from her car.
- Maybe she needs help.
- Bob.
- Okay. The guard who threw the block?
- Yeah.
- Forrest Gregg.
- No, no, no, Elijah Pitts.
- He's a running back.
- The Fridge. Refrigerator Perry?
IKE:
Maggie?
[SIGHS]
Hey. Here's a coat.
- Put this coat on. It's cold--
- Don't pretend to be a nice person.
- I was the only person in there defending you.
- You humiliated me!
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you
is what everyone else did in there.
- That is the theme of the party tonight.
- No. It was under control.
- Now they all feel sorry for me.
- Well, they should.
- They're about to see you hang yourself again.
- What do you--?!
Tell me something.
Do you really care about Mount Everest?
It's fun. Heh. It's high.
Sexual practices of locusts?
MAGGIE: Every one of those times,
I was being supportive.
Not supportive!
You weren't being supportive!
You were scared!
You were scared then, you're scared now.
You are the most lost woman--
- Lost?
- Yes, lost. You're so--
You're so lost, you don't even know
what kind of eggs you like.
- Yes!
- What?
Yes, yes, that's right.
With the priest, you wanted scrambled.
With the Deadhead, it was fried.
With the other guy, the bug guy, it was poached.
Now it's like, "Oh, uh, egg whites only.
Thank you very much."
That is called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.
Maggie, what are you doing?
You really want that guy up there to
drag you up Annapurna for your honeymoon?
You do not wanna climb Annapurna!
Yes, I do!
[SIGHS]
No, you don't.
You want a man who'll lead you down the beach...
...with his hand over your eyes...
...just so you can discover
the feel of sand under your feet.
You want a guy that'll wake you up at dawn.
He's just bursting to talk to you.
Can't wait another minute...
...just to find out what you'll say.
Am I right?
Stop it.
I'm getting married on Sunday.
And you are just trying to make me run.
Because you're a cynical, exploitive...
...mean-hearted creep...
...who wouldn't know real love
if it bit him in the armpit.
All you do is tear others down...
...and laugh at them
and criticize what they do...
...because you're too afraid
to do anything yourself.
I read your columns.
You never once wrote anything about yourself.
I am not the only one that is lost.
And you know it.
Am I right?
BOB:
Mag? Hey, help me out here.
Green Bay right guard.
Uh, uh, you know, Bart Starr, uh....

Okay.
- MAGGIE: Jerry Kramer.
- BOB: Jerry Kramer!
I started on the, uh, ice bowl story.
[BOB SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
Hey, Grandma.
- What's for lunch?
- Turkey and cheese.
Honey, your grandmother and I are thinking
about having a wedding gift museum.
[CHUCKLES]
- Stop.
- What?
Stop. Don't say another word like that.
- Maggie, it was just a joke.
- No!
It's humiliating, and it's gone on long enough.
You may not like that you have a daughter with problems.
But guess what.
I don't like that I have a father
who's drunk all the time.
I'll eat in my room.
CINDY: Tell me why Maggie's having another
rehearsal, and two days before the wedding.
She's already done this.
PEGGY: Well, Bob insisted
she visualize the ceremony.
Okay, we're ready.
You want me to have Ike leave now?
Uh, actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
- Ah, I'd rather not.
- MAGGIE: It'll give you a great view.
I think it's perfect. Okay? Hey.
- Hey.
- BOB: Okay.
Team effort, Pastor Ike.
- PEGGY: He's gonna be the pastor?
- Yes. Yes.
Because I want him front and center
so he can just see everything.
- Up there. That's it.
- Okay.
- Cindy, foyer.
- Okay.
[IKE SIGHS]
[BOB GRUNTS]
Ready?
PEGGY:
What happened at the luau?
I-- I don't-- I--
I don't wanna talk about the luau, okay?
What is this?
- PEGGY: It's for the bell.
- Oh.
- CINDY: Bob's in a hurry.
- Oh.
- BOB: Girls!
- Okay, Maggie, remember what Bob said.
- Let us visualize. Be the ball.
- Sink the putt.
- Make the shot.

Right? You're tensing. You feel it?
Right? We just need to limber you up
for a second, okay?
- Ike, come here, come here.
- Yeah.
You're me. Stand here
so she knows how far she's gotta come.
Honey, I'm gonna walk with you. Okay?
- Now he's the groom?

So if, uh, you were imagining me, you did great.
- What the hell were you doing?
- Uh, Bob, I'm really sorry. She kissed me back.
- I kissed you back?
- Yes, you kissed me back.
Yeah, caught that.
You wanna tell me how long this has been going on?
About a minute.
- Longer for me.
- Really?
- IKE: Yeah.
What do you expect me to say to this?

- Well, Bob, you could say, um:
"Well, I hope you two will be
really happy together."
I hope you two will be really happy together.

Well, you do have a dress.
And the church.

Then there's the two of us.
Maybe--
You do have to go down the aisle with somebody...
...that you love...
- ...and who loves you back.
- Who?

So am I.

I'll see you at the wedding. Right?
You're gonna be there, huh?

We're gonna spend part of the time here
because he wants to write a book.
Well, you always wanted to write a novel.
I feel inspired here. I feel like I can write.
I wanna write.

WOMAN 1: Wedding bells are ringing today
in Hale, Maryland.
Maggie Carpenter, always a bride, never a bridesmaid...
...is attempting to complete
her fourth wedding ceremony.
We'll be back when results are in.
Back to you, Jessica.
The turnout for this morning's ceremony
is usually saved for royalty or movie stars...
...but Maggie Carpenter is Hale, Maryland's
very own star.
T-shirts here. I got, "Bye, bye, bride-ee."
I got, "What part of 'I do'
don't you understand?"
Get your Runaway Bride T-shirts here.
Will she or won't she? That is on the minds
of these several hundred folks standing here...
...not to mention on the mind of
Groom Number 4, who is missing in action.
- He's gonna stand me up.
- Of course he's gonna come...
...because today I saw
eight geese flying in a V.
You with the lucky geese!
You always see geese!
- Not eight.
And in a V.
- Eight is better?
- Eight in a V. Can you imagine?
V. V for, uh....
- Victory? Victory?
- PEGGY: Victory!
- CINDY: And Velcro?
- Okay.
Velcro! Stick together!
- Virginal.
- Oh.
No, no.
I'm sweaty, I'm nervous.
Where are my bags?
- Okay. No.
- No bags. Bags are for later.
- Um, rub your ears. Rub your ears.
- Rub your ears. That's a great idea.
That's a very good idea. Rub your ears.
Cory does that to me sometimes.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.
- Thank you. We are friends, aren't we?
- Of course we are.
- You'll be my best man.
- I'm good, but I'm not sure I'm the best.
- Go see the pastor. He'll tell you what to do.
- All right.
Someone will tell me what to do.
Mm, you always looked great in that suit.
And, Ike?
I'm happy for you, honey.
I have a car waiting out back
for you just in case she decides to run.
BETTY:
I have an invitation. Lou! He's with me.
You look terrible.
Thanks.
Here.
- Ike, I'm glad it's you.
- Really?
I wouldn't want to have found out that
I wasn't the one for her in the fourth quarter.
Well, coach, any final advice?
BOB:
Maintain eye contact.
Eye contact. Eye contact. Eye contact.
What have you got going on here?
You wanna look just special for the wedding.
You should thank me and Lou
for lending you the wedding car, a '63 Buick.
- Thank you, Mrs. Trout.
- What are you saying? We're practically family.
- How's that there?
- Hello. My name is Fisher. What's yours?
Nice. Betty.
That doesn't want to come out, does it?
- You just pulled a hair from my neck.
- There we are.

- Oh, thank you, Grandma. I love you.
- I'm really rooting for this one.
- Okay, Dad.

town of Hale on the bride's side...
...and with many New Yorkers
on the groom's side.

- Is this taken?
- No.
I'm Elaine from Manhattan.
- I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth attempt.
- I'm sorry.
That's okay. There's a lid for every pot.

Don't tell me my doorman is one of your many admirers.
I'm making friends with your cat.

I don't have much choice in the matter, do I?
But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor.
I don't blame you for being mad.
Or furious.

So, what is it, Maggie?
You here on business?
By the way, I saw your lamps.
They're terrific. Yeah, really.
It's something I've always
wanted to do, and--
You know, you could make
breaking and entering into a new career.
So, what are you doing here, anyway?
I wanted to talk to you...
...about why I run...
...sometimes ride, away from things.
- Does it matter?
- I think so.
[MAGGIE CLEARS THROAT]
When I was walking down the aisle,
I was walking toward somebody...
...who had no idea who I really was.
And it was only half the other person's fault...
...because I had done everything
to convince him...
...that I was exactly what he wanted.
So it was good...
...that I didn't go through with it,
because it would've been a lie.
But you...
...you knew the real me.
Yes, I did.
I didn't.
Still, I ended up chasing a truck.
I can't do anything about the truck.
But, uh....

there could be more after this.
But if you could just have a seat.
Let's just not have that there.
Okay. Okay.

Definitely a first for me.
You're not gonna want to miss it, so pay close attention.

Will you marry me?

- Good. I was hoping you'd say that.
- You were not. Not true.
- Yes, I was, I was.
If you said yes, I wouldn't be able to do this
next part and I've been practicing, so let me--
Okay.
- Ready?
- I'm listening.
I guarantee that we'll have tough times.
And I guarantee that at some point...
...one or both of us will want to get out.
But I also guarantee...
...that if I don't ask you to be mine...
...I'll regret it for the rest of my life...
...because I know in my heart...
...you're the only one for me.
