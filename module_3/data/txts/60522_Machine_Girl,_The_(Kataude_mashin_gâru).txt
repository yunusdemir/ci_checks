What are you so scared of?.
If you move, you'II
get stabbed in the face.
P-PIease stop this!
Dumb-ass. Stop crying.
As punishment, we'II aII
throw our knives at once.
Ready, set...
Cut that out!
What if that kid gets
stabbed by your knives?
Who are you?
This is none of your business.
UnfortunateIy, it is my business.
You remember, don't you?
Yu Hyuga. My IittIe brother.
You buIIied him to death.
I have no idea who that is.
Oh, reaIIy?
Even if you don't remember him,
he's waiting for you in heII!
I'm gonna kiII you!
Stop screaming so patheticaIIy.
You're a man, aren't you?
You won't die from
getting your hand cut off.
After aII...
I onIy have one arm too!
I'II bIast you to pieces!
That thing is reaI! No fair!
So what?
Hey!
Are you okay?
You're safe now.
Murderer... Murderer...
Murderer!
That's right. I am a murderer.
But untiI a haIf year ago, I was
a normaI high schooIer who was abIe
to hoId her IittIe
brother with her Ieft arm.
Here we go, Yoshie.
<i>Six Months Ago
AII right!</i>
<i>Six Months Ago</i>
<i>Six Months Ago
Wait up!</i>
Wait, Ami!
Wait! Wait!
Nice shot! You're amazing, Ami!
You're reaIIy something. So cooI.
If you were a boy,
I might have faIIen for you.
Stop it.
I don't want a girI
to have a crush on me.
But it Iooks Iike
it's not that way after aII.
How so?
Because it Iooks
Iike you have a young fan.
You're so popuIar!
And he's so cute. I'm jeaIous.
Dummy. That's my IittIe brother, Yu.
I'm impressed, Sis. I had no idea
you were so good at basketbaII.
You're aIways Iying around the house.
Quiet, you.
So why'd you stop by today?
There's aIways something going on
when you come visit me Iike that.
I'II pay you back, so pIease Iend
me money to buy a new game!
I knew it.
No way.
We don't have that
kind of money to spend.
Sis, pIease. I reaIIy want it.
I'II cIean up every day,
even wash the dishes.
Sis. Come on, Sis.
ReaIIy?
Yu.
Takeshi, how much did you bring?
I took 10,000 yen from my mom.
I see. Me too.
They're not gonna be happy.
HeIIo, it's Yu.
It's Takeshi.
Excuse us.
You're Iate.
I'm sorry.
Where's the money?
Hurry up and hand it over.
This isn't even haIf
of what we agreed on.
Hey!
Hey, Yu...
How'd you get that money?
I borrowed it from my sister.
Then I expect you to get
more by tomorrow. 200,000 yen.
If you can't, then I'II make your sister
work at my dad's whorehouse.
She has nothing to do with this!
Who do you think you are?
Don't get me wrong.
I don't reaIIy want your money.
I just wanna have fun
by seeing you guys suffer.
Teppei...
He's a peon, but he's cunning.
Ryota Fujii... He's just a coward.
But the one I hate most
is the Ieader, Sho Kimura.
It's morning! Wake...
Oh, you got up earIy.
We're having fried chicken for
breakfast. They're stiII hot and tasty.
Hot!
Hey, what happened to your face?
I feII.
That can't be.
Come back here.
Yu, teII me the truth.
Okay, I got into
a fight and got pummeIed.
You weren't buIIied?
No, I'm not that hopeIess. I hit
a cIassmate who pissed me off.
Watch it.
You've done it now.
I won't go easy on you.
You shouIdn't use vioIence Iike that.
Remember what Dad used to say?
Jeez.
VioIence doesn't soIve anything.
It onIy hurts peopIe.
You and I fuIIy understand that.
When Mom and Dad kiIIed
themseIves over murder aIIegations,
we promised then.
Not to Iose Ioved ones.
To aIways be there for each other.
No matter what happens,
I'm going to protect you.
Sis...
Listen, Sho.
Whatever you do, do not ever bring
shame to our Hanzo Hattori cIan.
I know, Dad.
We may be yakuza now,
but never Iose your ninja pride.
Never Iet your guard down.
Never!
Everyone except
yourseIf is an enemy!
Think of them as sIaves, right?
That's right!
Do not fear bIades.
Use them to destroy your enemy!
Destroy! Destroy!
Very good.
You are my fIesh and bIood.
I wiII make our bond even greater.
A cup of my own bIood.
Drink it to strengthen our bond.
Drink it...
Drink more...
Drink it...
Sho...
As Iong as you're around,
our cIan wiII never die.
You are my treasure!
Master, your breakfast is ready.
Hey.
You must be new.
How dare you interrupt our sacred
rituaI between father and son?
You!
Young master, have a good day.
Good morning, Mom.
What are you doing?
Oh, good morning.
This maid's been messing
up a Iot, so I'm punishing her.
Have a nice day.
Have a nice day!
She was a terribIe maid.
Bye-bye.
Have a nice day.
Where are you going?
SchooI's the other way.
Where's the money?
Wait! Come back!
What the heII?
Watch where you're going!
Come here, you! Come on!
You open?
HeIIo.
Excuse me! Is Takeshi here?
Hey! Wait! Who are you?
What's wrong with kids these days?
They don't even say heIIo.
Miki, do you know that kid?
Miki?
What was that?
I'm scared... I'm scared...
Those guys are... It's me.
We're in troubIe. Run for it.
What shouId we do?
What shouId we do?
What do you want with Takeshi?
Sorry...
Sorry...
Ma, this is my friend, Yu Hyuga.
Ma, this is my friend, Yu Hyuga.
You're the son of
those aIIeged murderers.
That's not true! My dad
was framed and kiIIed himseIf.
I don't care.
Just stay away from my son.
Go home!
Takeshi? Takeshi!
Takeshi, where are you going?
Takeshi!
Ready?
Ready?
Okay.
Go for it!
You're amazing!
Nice shot! Just as I expected!
I'm jeaIous of you. Seeing you
and Yu get aIong Iike that.
He seems Iike a nice kid.
He must be easy to deaI with.
That's not true.
He's very seIfish.
I don't know what to do with him.
This is bad!
Y-Yoshie, excuse me.
W-Wait, Ami!
Where are you going? Jeez...
HoId it!
Where do you think you're going?
Stop running away, man!
Sorry...
Sorry...
Hey.
Where to, girI?
I'm in a rush.
What's the rush?
Where are you going?
Stop!
Who do you think you are?
No! No! Stop!
No!
Stop...
No! Stop!
What are you thinking?
You broke your promise.
Do you know how embarrassing
this is for a yakuza's son?
Stop!
Stop!
Beating on you two isn't much fun.
I think I want Yu's sister to be my toy.
I hear she's got big tits,
and she's cute. Go find her.
Don't you dare Iay
a finger on my sister!
You sissies. You pissed me off.
I won't take it easy on you!
What the heII?
Yu!
You're pretty strong.
Is your sister strong too?
She's much stronger!
Then she shouId've trained you better.
Takeshi...
Are you okay?
Yu, I'm scared...
Shut up!
Takeshi!
Takeshi!
See ya.
Sis...
Yu?
Yu...
Yu!
Yu...
Yu...
This is some kind of joke, right?
<i>Sugihara Motors</i>
<i>Sugihara Motors</i>
Takeshi...
Why did you have to go?
Takeshi...
Takeshi...
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Takeshi...
Who are you?
I'm Yu's oIder sister.
I'm so sorry about Takeshi...
What do you want?
The poIice are trying
to caII it a suicide.
But I know someone was
responsibIe for their deaths.
If onIy I had a Iead...
Stop it.
I don't want you pIaying the victim.
Look.
If it weren't for your brother,
Takeshi wouId stiII be aIive!
But...
You peopIe are murderers.
YourfamiIy brings misfortune
to everyone around you!
Stop it!
Get out of here!
Miki.
Neither Yu, Dad, nor I
wouId ever kiII anyone...
There's no way Yu wouId kiII himseIf.
No way.
Someone forced him into it.
Someone must've kiIIed him!
''PeopIe I want to kiII.''
What is this?
Why didn't I find out sooner?
Yu...
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry.
I'm not sure about tempura
in the morning. Is it okay?
The incident with your
brother breaks my heart.
I'm sad since I was his friend.
Ryota, who's the Ieader of the group?
Ryota needs to get to schooI, so...
Wait.
WeII, I'm going.
Make yourseIf at home.
So...
Are you saying that our
Ryota buIIied your brother?
This diary is proof.
I'd Iike you to come to
the poIice precinct with me.
You're an idiot!
We've been in the poIice business
ever since my grandfather's time.
You're Hyuga, right?
I know that your father is a murderer.
Trying to faIseIy accuse my son...
What do you want?
Murderer!
What?
If he was being buIIied,
maybe it was because something
was wrong with your brother.
I don't want you bIaming us
for your brother's probIems.
PIease stop.
I want to taIk caImIy.
I can't taIk to you.
A minx Iike you shouId be arrested!
Stop!
There's no need for this vioIence!
I'm doing this to protect my son!
PIease stop!
It's hot!
Oh, it fried up very niceIy.
Such tasty tempura.
Hot! Hot! Hot!
Damn it!
H-Honey!
Honey, are you okay?
Don't caII the cops.
I'II find her and finish her off!
It stings...
Oh, it stings...
It stings.
I-It stings...
Ow...
Ow...
Stop.
If you make a noise, I'II sIit your throat.
Now apoIogize to Yu
and teII me who your Ieader is.
I don't know.
I'II teII you. The Ieader is
a yakuza's son, Sho Kimura!
Sho Kimura?
I can't breathe... Murderer...
I aIways beIieved that it was
wrong to kiII no matter what.
But I Iearned from your parents
that there's a time and pIace for it!
A bIackout?
Ryota!
I hope you rot in heII together!
Mother, there's
no conditioner. Can you get some?
Sir, how about
an unusuaI conditioner?.
It can't be... you!
Ryota!
Wash your hair with your son's bIood!
Ryota!
Ryota?
PIease, God!
Serves you right.
I'm a demon! I turned into a demon!
I'II remain a demon untiI I kiII
every Iast one of Yu's enemies!
DeIicious.
Here are your noodIes and soup...
Hot!
Hey! What do you think you're doing?
What'II you do
about the master's Ieg?
I don't Iike that Iook on your face!
Hey!
Keep it down.
Sorry about that.
You must be the new chef, right?
Yes...
Got kids?
No.
Kids are great.
I did a Iot of bad things in
my Iife, but my kids need me.
Sho means everything to me.
I Iive because of him.
And you caused him great pain...
Cut off a finger as an apoIogy!
PIease forgive me!
Honey, that's not right.
You aIways do this.
I'm reaIIy sorry about aII this.
You're too soft!
Even aII five fingers wouIdn't
be enough to make it up to Sho!
I am formerIy of the Kanto Beasts!
Don't fuck with me!
No!
If you don't want to die,
then at Ieast apoIogize Iike
the true chef you are, huh?
Excuse me. I want
to ask you for directions.
Where do you need to go?
Where's Sho Kimura?
Take me to him!
Now, eat some sushi...
Now, eat some sushi...
Eat as much as you want...
Go ahead and eat.
If you say so...
How do your fingers taste?
We need a new
chef starting tomorrow.
I'm going to the bathroom.
You're Sho Kimura?
Who the heII are you?
What was that sound?
Sho!
Who the heII are you?
Stay back or I'II sIit his throat.
I'm not afraid to die.
I just want to kiII him.
No way. You can't kiII me.
What's that?
You won't get away! Someone!
Right!
She's good.
You...
You kiIIed my Yu!
Go through!
You did pretty good for a girI.
But it's over now.
I'm sure you know what's
going to happen to you, right?
Yu's sister, I feeI sorry for you.
You were so cIose.
Wounds from burns and a katana.
Your arm is a mess, girI.
We, the Hattori cIan, won't kiII
our enemy after they're captured.
We give them a taste
of heII before kiIIing them.
I thought your stupid
son was the crazy one,
but you're aII insane!
You have pretty fingers...
I can't beIieve these beIong
to such a strong girI Iike you...
SIice, sIice, sIice these fingers off...
O great Hanzo Hattori.
Provide this girI with
great pain and suffering.
It hurts!
That was for aII three of us.
But we're not done yet.
Now this is from the great Hanzo!
It Iooks pretty nice without any fingers.
I think that's enough for today.
One minute.
Wait.
You shouId keep going, honey!
Torture isn't fun unIess
you do it a IittIe bit at a time.
That's why you're too soft.
You shouId finish her off at once!
You shut up and Iet me do my job!
I'm gonna give you a painkiIIer.
The boss is being kind.
It's a shame you're
gonna be hacked up tomorrow.
Such a nice body.
Give me the key
to unIock this chain! Now!
What is this?
Shit. She escaped.
Hey! Someone!
What's wrong?
That girI...
That bitch... Where did she go?
Like I said,
you were too easy on her!
Find her and kiII her.
Yu...
Where are you taking me?
Don't overdo it.
You won't be abIe to work
efficientIy even if you work overtime.
I'II take over.
I'II take over.
Don't.
I want to keep working.
If I stop working for even a bit,
I start to think about Takeshi.
I see...
Hey, Miki!
Someone's coIIapsed outside!
Hey! Are you okay?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, Miki...
Are you okay? Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
This girI...
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?
Yeah. Don't worry.
I'm the son of a doctor.
When I was in the biker gang, I fixed
up buddies who got hurt in fights.
IncIuding you.
Hey, you're going to throw her
out when she wakes up, right?
I don't want to get
dragged into anything.
Even if it has something
to do with Takeshi's death?
I'm sure she's Iike this
because she discovered the truth.
It's not safe for her out there.
So you want to keep her here?
No way.
You have nothing against her, right?
Hey, are you okay?
You...
I'm home.
No! Who are you peopIe?
No! Get off of me!
Sorry to barge in.
We hear that you're
best friends with Ami Hyuga.
Is she here?
I don't know what you're
taIking about. She's not here!
I'm not invoIved with anything!
I don't know any Ami.
I don't know her!
I see.
I apoIogize then.
She wasn't here after aII, huh?
Then we have to keep
you quiet about aII this.
Hey, why don't you do it with her?.
Right.
It's not often that
you get to do a coIIege girI.
Where the heII did she go?
You can eat a rice baII
with one hand, right? Here.
So what you toId us is true?
Takeshi was kiIIed by a yakuza's son?
I wouIdn't have Iost
my arm if it weren't true.
Who and where is he? TeII me!
Shut up. I thought you didn't want
to have anything to do with me.
Is that how you taIk
to peopIe who saved your Iife?
You toId me once
not to pIay the victim.
WeII, right back at you!
Now you did it.
I don't give a damn
if you onIy have one arm!
Hey... What are you doing, Miki?
She hasn't recovered yet.
PIease don't stop us.
No matter what shape I'm in,
I just want to settIe this.
It's a battIe between those
who've Iost Ioved ones.
The Ioser wiII be covered in bIood.
I can't Iose.
No matter what happens to my body,
I have to seek revenge for Yu's sake!
Me too.
I'm furious with myseIf for not
being abIe to protect Takeshi!
Ow!
Are you okay?
Ami, you're pretty good
even if you onIy have one arm.
You came at me
with everything you had.
I Iike that.
Mind if I join you
in getting your revenge?
You'II be with a murderer.
Are you sure?
They're my enemies too.
Besides, if there's a way to get
revenge by not kiIIing peopIe,
then I'd Iike to know it.
It's kiII, kiII, kiII.
Ami, it must be hard
to fight with that kind of body.
I'II make you a new arm.
One made of steeI.
You think you can
avenge your brother Iike that?
He won't be abIe
to rest in peace, you idiot!
It's tough!
It's tough!
This training is for moving forward!
You didn't even move a miIIimeter.
Come on! Keep going!
Cute face.
Those are the eyes. Remember that!
Can I heIp you?
The Kimuras moved away recentIy.
Where?
Where?
How shouId I know?
But I'm gIad the yakuza are gone.
Thank you.
Suguru?
Oh, Ami.
I'm aImost done.
Thank you... for everything.
I hope you'II stay friends with my wife.
She can't have any more kids.
I wasn't abIe to understand her pain.
But, Ami...
She was saved by meeting you.
So pIease take good care of her.
I wiII.
Ami! We have a probIem!
The Kimura famiIy's gone.
What?
They're up to something.
Hey, do you hear a strange noise?
The machine gun...
The machine gun...
Okay!
AII right, caIm down... CaIm down...
We are
the Junior High Shuriken Gang!
Whoa.
Takeshi's house is reaIIy dirty.
Excuse me, but couId
you stop wandering around?
Your famiIy members
died on their own,
so don't hoId a grudge against us.
HonestIy, it's disturbing.
I'm going to kiII that bastard!
You stupid brat.
You're gonna get it!
We might get kiIIed first!
The wire...
Honey, is that
machine gun finished yet?
Hang on! I just have
to attach the trigger!
Aw, Iooks Iike it's over now.
Damn it...
It went in! Yes! It's done!
I'm finished...
Ami! Take it!
Honey!
Honey! Honey!
Shit...
She's pretty good...
I'm hit!
Mommy...
Mommy...
Honey! Honey...
Honey...
No!
Honey! Honey!
Honey...
Suguru...
Takashi! Takashi! Takashi!
Damn it... Who kiIIed my son?
I'II never forgive... Who kiIIed him?
I'm sorry about your Ioss.
I know who kiIIed your sons.
Do you want me to heIp you?
There's no point hiding here.
My boss wiII find you two
and send out an assassin.
I'm not running away.
I'm just waiting for
my chance for revenge.
Stop bIuffing and
give me something to eat.
I'm hungry. I'm reaIIy hungry.
If I kiII you, then I won't know
where to find the Kimuras.
So I'II Iet you Iive for now!
Here's a rice baII.
Eat it.
Come on.
Thanks.
But that kindness
happens to be your weakness.
Thank you for coming.
I know that you have aII Iost
your chiIdren for no good reason.
Your enemies wiII sureIy come here.
I want to heIp you get your revenge!
We're going to kiII those women!
Ryota!
Damn...
I can't beIieve I screwed up...
Ami.
Did you find out
where the Kimuras are?
I reaIIy want to kiII them.
Miki?
Miki, Iet me take a Iook.
No...
It Iooks bad...
Her wound is getting infected.
She'II die if you don't
get her to a hospitaI.
Miki... You can't fight Iike this.
Let's go to the nearest
hospitaI to get you fixed up.
Wait a minute...
You want to go without me?
You've gotta be kidding me.
I can'tjust reIax without
getting my revenge!
No!
Miki?
I...
I don't want you to die.
I'II be the one to die
after getting our revenge.
So I don't want you to die.
I Iost everyone I Ioved.
I have no more hope Ieft.
But after I met you,
I was abIe to understand
what it's Iike to protect someone.
Miki.
You're the onIy one who
means something to me now.
Thanks, Ami.
But I Iost my husband and Takeshi.
I'm as good as dead.
If I don't crush the Kimuras,
then they'II never rest in peace.
Ami...
Ami, I'm begging you.
PIease Iet me die in peace.
Miki...
Come on.
We don't have much time.
TeII me where the Kimuras are hiding.
I'm not going to teII you
even if you bash my head in!
I see.
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop messing around...
Stop! Stop!
Stop it...
You naiIed me!
Using a naiI isn't fair!
Stop compIaining.
We're risking our Iives, you know!
Miki, Iet's go.
Let's go on a journey to heII
in order to kiII the Kimuras!
It's time to get your revenge.
This is too much! No more!
The Kimuras have
a hideout at Ichinooka Shrine.
Ichinooka Shrine?
This is the way
to Ichinooka Shrine, right?
Ami, if you can't use your machine
gun, use the weapons in this bag.
We're running short
on machine-gun buIIets.
You can use...
This.
This buIIet is very powerfuI.
It's nothing Iike the other ones.
Use it to finish your opponent.
It's got too much power and might
just destroy your machine gun.
Think of it as
a Iast present from Suguru.
Okay.
Even with a weapon Iike that,
the two of you are gonna get kiIIed.
But it's impressive that
you got the boss aII fired up.
Shut up.
Come on, Ami.
Let's go!
What? You actuaIIy came?
My parents are angry.
Why don't you just die
before you compIicate things?
What? You IittIe punk!
Huh? What's this?
Ryota...
Tomokazu...
Takashi...
Yoshio...
Ryota...
Tomokazu...
Takashi...
I'II give you credit for coming this far.
I'II do whatever
it takes to protect our son!
You're not the onIy ones who can
become demons for yourfamiIies.
Listen!
We have gathered to punish
you for our sons' deaths.
We're the Super Mourner Gang!
Shit... You bastards...
FeeI the wrath of my son!
Ami!
You kiIIed my son!
Give him back!
No way.
BuIIetproof vests under the pictures...
Takashi!
Tomokazu! I'm sorry!
I'm out of buIIets.
Wrong target.
Thanks for waiting, Ami.
Do you think you can kiII me?
My most deadIy ninja weapon.
The executioner's bIade. Take this!
Takashi...
Ami.
Here we go! Take this!
Miki!
Miki!
Ami...
Don't worry about me...
KiII the Kimuras.
You have to kiII them for me!
I've chopped off such a useIess thing.
In a matter of minutes, you wiII die.
Then you won't be abIe
to hoId a grudge against me.
But if you stiII want to kiII me,
then come this way!
How dare you do this to Miki...
Miki...
Go...
Die in front of our great Hanzo's spirit!
You wiII perish.
ApoIogize to the great
Hanzo in the afterIife!
Sho...
I couIdn't protect you...
Take that, you brutaI yakuza.
Ami... Ami...
I-I... I'm coming...
You're not going anywhere!
Ryota!
Ryota!
Ami!
Don't Iet them beat you!
Miki...
Miki, I wish I couId join you...
But I want you to wait for me...
Sho Kimura's stiII in the main haII...
I can't die untiI I take his head.
Missy, I'm over here.
I-I'm scared... I'm scared...
I'm using these three as my shieId.
If you want to kiII me, go ahead.
But they're going to die too.
You're such a coward.
A ninja does whatever
it takes to survive.
Sho is much more of
a ninja than his father was.
That's because I raised him right.
You stupid bitch.
A person without Iove
can't possibIy Iove their chiId!
No way...
The chainsaw was defIected?
I'm sorry.
I'm wearing a speciaI bra.
A steeI one.
A driII bra.
It can't be...
Yes, it can be.
What do you think of it?
Enjoy my driII.
WeII?
WeII?
How do you Iike my driII bra?
Now I'II driII your face.

Your Iove turned out to be harmfuI...

Listen up. Go down
the mountain and get some heIp.
Find the poIice and teII them

Go on.
Even if you get buIIied,
