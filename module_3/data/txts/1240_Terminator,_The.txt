(IMITATING POLICEMAN) This is 1-L19.
Westbound on Olympic approaching Overland.
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.
No, but you will. It's very
important that you live.
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...
He's not a man. A machine.
A Terminator. A Cyberdine
systems model 101.
A machine?
- Like a robot?
- Not a robot. A cyborg.
A cybernetic organism.
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.
Get your head down!
All right, listen. The Terminator's
an infiltration unit...
part man, part machine. Underneath,
it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...
microprocessor controlled,
fully armored, very tough.
But outside, it's
living human tissue.
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.
Look, Reese, I don't know
what you want from...
Pay attention! I got
to ditch this car.
The 600 series had rubber
skin. We spotted them easy.
But these are new.
They look human...
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.
Look... I am not stupid, you know.
They cannot make things like that yet.
Not yet. Not for about forty years.
- Are you saying it's from the future?
- One possible future.
From your point of view...
I don't know tech stuff.
Then you're from the future,
too, is that right?
- Right.
- Right.
Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.
Don't do that again.
- Just let me go.
- Listen!
And understand. That
Terminator is out there.
It can't be bargained with.
It can't be reasoned with.
It doesn't feel pity
or remorse or fear.
And it absolutely
will not stop. Ever!
Until you are dead.
Can you stop it?
I don't know.
With these weapons, I don't know.

units ran night and day.
We were that close
to going out forever.
But there was one man
who taught us to fight,
to storm the wire of the camps, to smash
those metal motherfuckers into junk.
He turned it around. He brought
us back from the brink.
His name was Connor. John Connor.

(DISTANT SIREN)

With the 132nd, under

- That's the year 2027?
- That's right. And I was assigned...
This is fucking great.
REESE: The last two years
under John Connor.
- Who was the enemy again?
- A computer defense system built for...
- (BEEP BEEP BEEP)
- Oh, damn. Sorry.
Built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdine systems.
I see.
And this, uh, computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy,
killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived,
a sort of retroactive abortion?
That guy Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, he had this guy in here that
burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,
- then he set it on fire.
- Hey, shut up.
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?
It had no choice. Their
defense grid was smashed.
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.
Is that when you captured the lab complex
and found that... uh, what is it called?
Uh... the time
displacement equipment?
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.
How are you supposed get back?
I can't.
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.
It's just him and me.
(COCKS RIFLE)
It's just him and me.
Why didn't you bring any weapons,
something more advanced?
Don't you have ray guns?
Ray guns.
DR. SILBERMAN ON TAPE:
Show me a piece of future technology.
You go naked. Something about the
field generated by a living organism.
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?
- I didn't build the fucking thing!
- OK, OK. But this...
- (SIGHS) Cyborg, if it's metal...
- Surrounded by living tissue!
Oh. Right, right...
This is great stuff. I could
make a career out of this guy.
You see how clever this part is? How
it doesn't require a shred of proof?
And most paranoid delusions are
intricate, but this is brilliant.
DR. SILBERMAN: Why were the
other two women killed?
Most of the records were lost in the war.
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's
mother. Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city. The
Terminator was just being systematic.
- Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...
- Look, you have heard enough!
I have answered your questions!
Now I have to see Sarah Connor!
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?
- Because I can help you.
- Who is in authority here?
- Reese...
- Shut up!
You still don't get it, do you?
He'll find her.
That's what he does!
That's all he does!
You can't stop him!
He'll wade through you, reach down her
throat, and pull her fucking heart out!
- Doc.
- REESE: Let... let go of me!
Sorry.
- So, Reese is crazy?
- In technical terminology...
He's a loon.
Sarah, this is what
they call body armor.
Our TAC guys wear these. It'll
stop a twelve-gauge round.
This other individual must have been wearing
one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.
What about when he punched
through the windshield?
He was probably on PCP.
Broke every bone in his hand
and wouldn't feel it for hours.
There was this guy once...
- You see this scar?
- Here.
Thank you.
There's a couch in this other room. Why don't
you stretch out and try to get some sleep?
It'll be at least an hour before your

give to you. Made me memorize it.
"Thank you, Sarah, for your
courage through the dark years.
I can't help you with what you must soon face

I was dreaming about dogs.
We use them to spot Terminators.
Your world is pretty terrifying.

(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Hey, buddy, you got a dead
cat in there, or what?
(KNOCKING)
Fuck you, asshole.
Goddamn!
SARAH: Thank you.
(HORN HONKS)
Uh, is this enough?
Yeah, it's enough. I don't
want to ask where you got it.
- MAN: I'm coming.
- We need a room.
- All right.
- With a kitchen.
Do you have one with a kitchen?
Mmm.
I am dying for a shower.
We should check your bandage, too.
Later. I'm going out for supplies.
Keep this.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
SARAH: No, I can't tell you where
I am, mom. I was told not to say.
<i>Oh, but, honey, I need to
know where I can reach you.</i>
<i>You tell me to hide out up here at
the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>
<i>and you won't tell me what's
going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>
OK.
- OK, here's the number. Ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.
<i>It's 408-555...</i>
<i>- 1439.</i>
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Room 9. Got it?</i>
- Uh-huh.
- I've got it.
<i>- I've got to go.</i>
<i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more
right now. I love you, mom.</i>
I love you, too, sweetheart.
<i>- MAN: Tiki motel.</i>
- Give me your address there.
SARAH: What have we got?
Mothballs.
Corn syrup.
Ammonia. What's for dinner?
- Plastique.
- Mmm, that sounds good.
What is it?
Nitroglycerin, basically.
It's a bit more stable.
I learned to make it
when I was a kid.
Make sure there's
none on the threads.
Like this.
Screw the end cap on.
Very gently.
You must've had a fun childhood.
That's good.
All right. Six more like that, and
I'll get started on the fuses.
SARAH: He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.
It'll never be over, will it?
Look at me. I'm shaking.
Some legend, huh? You must
be pretty disappointed.
No. I'm not.
Kyle...
The women in your time...
what are they like?
Good fighters.
That's not what I meant.
Was there someone special?
- Someone?
- A girl. You know.
No.
Never.
Never?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
So much pain.
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.
So you feel nothing?
John Connor gave me a
picture of you once.
I didn't know why at the
time. It was very old...
Torn... faded.
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just... a little sad.
I used to always wonder what you
were thinking at that moment.
I memorized every line,
every curve.
I came across time for you, Sarah.
I love you. I always have.
I shouldn't have said that.
Think fast! (CHUCKLES)

(SARAH SCREAMING)
Kyle.
- Whoa!
- Son of a bitch!
You stay here.
Let's get out of here.
Get out.
Kyle. Come on, get up.
He's coming.
Kyle? Come on!
Help me! Get out! Get out!
Get out!
SARAH: Come on!
Faster!
(KYLE PANTING)
KYLE: Don't stop! Run!
Sarah!
Kyle!
Oh, Kyle. Kyle.
We did it, Kyle. We got it.
No!
No!
KYLE: Wait!
- SARAH: What are you doing?
- Cover, so he can't track us.
Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!
- Come on! Come on!
- Leave me here.
SARAH: Get up!
Move it, Reese!
On your feet, soldier!
On your feet! Move it!
Back. Go back.
- Run, Sarah.
- No.
Run!
Run!
Come on, motherfucker.
(SCREAMS IN PAIN)
(SCREAMING)
No, no.
You're terminated, fucker.

(RADIO CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)
SARAH:
Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?
What's most difficult for me is trying to
decide what to tell you and what not to.
But I guess I have a while yet before you're
old enough to even understand these tapes.
They're more for me at this point,
just so that I can get it straight.
<i>- Gasolina, por favor.
- ¿Cuánto?</i>
<i>- Llena el tanque.</i>
- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>
Should I tell you about your
father? Boy, that's a tough one.
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.
God, a person could go
crazy thinking about this.
I suppose I will tell you.
I owe him that.
Maybe it'll help if...
You know that in the few
hours that we had together...
We loved a lifetime's worth.
<i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,
y tengo pena decirle</i>
<i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,
pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful, señora...
and he's ashamed to ask you for five
American dollars for his picture,
but if he doesn't, his
father will beat him.
Pretty good hustle, kid.
<i>- Cuatro
- Sí, sí.</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>
<i>¡Miren, miren!</i>
<i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>
What did he just say?
He said there's a storm coming in.
I know.
