Hey!
Hey!
Help!
Help! Help!
Fuck.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.
Okay. What was it? What's the number?
What's the number?
1-2-1...
Fuck!
Where is it?
- 911. Please hold.
- No! Wait! Please!
- Yes. 911.
- Hello. I'm buried.
You have to help me. You have to help me.
I can't breathe.
- Sir?
- I'm buried in a coffin. Please, help.
- Send someone to find me.
- Sir, slow down.
- What is your name?
- Paul. Paul Conroy.
Okay, Mr. Conroy.
Can you tell me your location?
I don't know. I'm in a coffin.
I don't know where. Please, help. I'm scared.
- You're in a coffin?
- Yes.
It's like one of those old, wooden ones.
- Are you at a funeral home?
- No. No. No. I don't know. No.
- How are you calling me right now?
- What?
If you're buried in a coffin,
where are you calling me from?
From a cell phone.
There was an old cell phone in the coffin.
- You're calling me from your cell phone?
- Yes.
Yes. Yes. No, no. It's not my cell phone,
but, yes, I'm calling from a cell phone.
There was a cell phone in the coffin
when you climbed in?
Yes. What?
- I didn't climb in, though.
- How did you end up in the coffin, sir?
- I was put here.
- In the coffin?
Yes. Please, help.
- And you're saying the coffin is buried?
- Yes. Yeah.
I'm a truck driver. I'm an American.
It's hot in here, and I can't breathe.
- Please.
- Do you know your location, sir?
- I told you, somewhere in Iraq. Please, help.
- Iraq?
Yes. I'm a truck driver. I'm an American.
I work for CRT.
- Are you a soldier, sir?
- No, please, you have to listen to me.
I'm a truck driver. I'm an American.
I'm a civilian contractor working in Iraq.
We were attacked in Baqubah.
And they... They shot all of them.
- They shot who, sir?
- All of the other drivers.
And you are saying this happened in Iraq?
The country?
Yeah. Please, listen to me, okay?
Listen to me.
They gave me a safety number and it was in
my wallet, and I don't know where it is now.
Mr. Conroy, this is 911 emergency
in Youngstown, Ohio.
- Ohio?
- Yes, sir.
I'm not sure exactly how you called here
if you're in another country,
but if you'd like,
I can patch you through
to the sheriff's department.
You don't understand. Forget it.
Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.
Pick up.
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message
after the beep. Thanks!
Yeah, Linda. Linda, honey, it's me.
I need you... I need you... I need you
to contact the National Guard right away,
or the Pentagon.
Tell them that we were attacked
in the Diyala province, in Baqubah.
They need to find me. Okay?
Please, baby,
you've got to help them find me.
- Hi, this is Linda.
- No!
Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.
Linda! Linda,
I need you to call me right away, okay?
Call me at this number.
It's an absolute emergency.
Call me at the number that comes up
on your screen right away. Okay?
I don't know what the hell
is going on, but...
...I'm buried in a box.
I'm buried in a box.
I can't breathe in here.
Call me whenever you can. Please, baby.
What city and state, please?
I don't know. The FBI, wherever they are.
Do you have a specific city
you'd like to be connected to?
Anywhere. Any city.
Just connect me to the FBI.
Sir, I have FBI field offices listed in Boston,
Chicago, New York, Philadelphia...
- it doesn't matter.
- New Haven...
Any city, anywhere. Just connect me, please.
I'm sorry, sir,
but I'm not allowed to do that.
- Chicago! Fine? Chicago! Okay?
- There's no need to be rude, sir.
Please, hold for your number.
The number you requested...
3-1-2
4-2-1
6-7-0-0
can be connected
for an additional charge of 25 cents
by pressing the number 1.
Chicago field office. Special Agent Harris.
- Is this the FBI?
- Yes, it is, sir.
Okay. I'm calling from Iraq.
I'm buried in the desert somewhere.
I need you to help me.
Whoa. Whoa. Sir, slow down.
- When were you in Iraq?
- Now.
Now. I'm there now. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT.
I've been here for nine months.
- May I have your name, please, sir?
- It's Paul Conroy.
- Paul Conroy.
- Yeah.
Okay, Paul, explain to me what's going on.
All right, all right. Okay.
All right, me and a convoy of other drivers
were delivering some kitchen supplies
to a community center.
And then some kids,
they started throwing rocks at the trucks.
And then, an IED went off up ahead
and it blew up one of the other trucks.
And then these guys,
they came out from behind the houses
and they started shooting everyone
right there on the street.
- Were you shot at?
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I was way in the back of the convoy.
I guess I got hit in the head
by one of the other...
By one of the rocks and I blacked out,
and that's the last thing that I remember.
And then I woke up here, tied up,
in a coffin.
- Who put you there?
- I guess whoever ambushed us.
- A bunch of kids?
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
Some kids, the kids,
they threw the rocks at us.
These guys, some Iraqis, some insurgents.
I don't fucking know.
They just... They popped out
and they started shooting everybody
- right there on the street.
- I thought you said they didn't shoot at you.
- They didn't! I don't know. They shot them!
- Sir, you're gonna have to stop shouting.
I'm shouting because you're not listening
to me! I need you to help me!
Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.
Can you trace the call? GPS or something?
Why is it that they didn't shoot you?
I don't know. I have no idea.
They didn't. That's all I know.
What's your social security number, Paul?
Why?
Why? Who cares?
I'm buried in the middle
of the fucking desert,
who cares what my social security number is?
I'm an American citizen.
Just send someone to find me. Please!
Do you have any idea where...
What? Hold on, hold on. I can't hear you.
What did you... Hold on, hold on.
No, no, no. I can't...
Shit!
Fuck.
Come on.
Thank you for calling
Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
How may I direct your call?
Somebody.
I need to talk to somebody right away.
- It's an emergency.
- Who is this, please?
It's Paul Conroy.
I'm a driver for you guys.
I'm calling from Iraq.
- My convoy was attacked.
- Sir, if this is a crisis situation,
you need to contact
the safety number you were...
I know. I know. I know.
I don't have it anymore. The people took it.
Who took it, sir?
I don't... I don't know.
The Iraqis, I think. I blacked out.
I'm going to put you through
to Alan Davenport.
- Who's that?
- Director of personnel. Please hold.
Personnel? No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!
At CRT, we work with our clients to provide
effective and sustainable solutions
to the challenges they face
in our fast-growing, global economy.
As the...
You've reached Alan Davenport,
Personnel Director
at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
Please leave your name
and number at the tone,
and I will return your call
as soon as possible.
This is Paul Conroy.
I'm from Hastings, Michigan.
I'm a driver for CRT.
My convoy was ambushed by terrorists,
or insurgents. I don't know.
I don't know who it was. And I'm stuck.
I'm buried in a coffin in the ground,
and I need help.
Please send help. I'm begging you.
I think I'm in Baqubah
in the Diyala province.
I'm not sure. Please.
Please send help right away.
I can't breathe in here. I can't breathe.
I didn't know who else to call.
Please, send...
Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!
Come on.
Hello? Is anybody there?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Breathe no breathe, American?
- Breathe no breathe?
- Wait, wait. Hold... Hold on.
I don't know what you're saying. Who is this?
American can breathe no breathe?
No, I can't breathe.
Please get me out of here.
- Get out?
- Yeah, yeah. Get me out.
Get me out. Please help.
- Soldier.
- No, no. I'm not a soldier.
I'm a truck driver. Just a contractor.
- Contractor?
- Yeah, yeah, a contractor.
That's all. No soldier.
- Blackwater.
- No. Not for Blackwater.
I'm not a security contractor.
I'm just a truck driver. That's all.
- You American?
- Yeah.
Then you soldier.
No, I'm not.
I'm here, unarmed. But you still shot at us.
In head and in throat,
so you tell no more lies.
No, I'm not lying. We were all drivers.
- Drive what?
- Trucks. Trucks.
The trucks you see driving around
with supplies.
That's me. That's us. That's all.
Not a soldier. Truck driver.
- Five million, money.
- What?
Five million, money, tonight, 9:00 p.m.,
or you stay. Buried like dog.
- $5 million? From who?
- Your family.
My family doesn't have $5 million.
If they did, I wouldn't be here.
From embassy.
I don't know. Yeah, yeah, from the embassy.
If you let me out of here,
they'll pay you the money. Yeah.
9:00 p.m., five million, money.
Oh, God. What's your number?
- What city and listing, please?
- Hastings, Michigan.
I'm looking for Donna Mitchell.
I have two Donna Mitchells, sir.
One on Federal Road
and one on Ardmore Avenue.
Ardmore Avenue. I think. No. Shit!
I don't know. Yeah, just give me that one.
- Ardmore Avenue?
- Yes, Ardmore Avenue.
Please hold for your number.
The number you requested...
269-148
1998 can be...
Come on.
Where is everybody?
- Hello?
- Donna, it's Paul.
- Hey. How's it going?
- Okay.
I need to talk to Linda.
She's not answering her phone.
I've got a problem.
I've been held hostage
by a group of guys that...
Fooled you. I'm not really home.
But if you leave a message, I'll get back
to you as soon as I get in. Bye-bye.
Donna, I need to talk to Linda.
It's an absolute emergency.
Have her call me. Use star 69
to find out the number of this phone
and have her call me at this number, okay?
- Paul?
- Donna.
- What do you want?
- I need to talk to Linda. Where is she?
I don't know. I haven't talked to her all day.
Call her cell...
- Are you at your computer right now?
- Yeah. Why?
Okay, I need you to look up a number
for me to the State Department.
Paul, I was just heading out
to the supermarket. I really...
Please, please, please.
Just look up the number for me.
- Is everything all right?
- No! Everything is not all right!
- Just look up the number for me.
- Don't fucking yell at me...
- I'm not yelling at you, Donna.
- Yes, you are.
No, I'm not. Just get me the fucking number!
Get me the number! Get me the fucking number!
Fuck!
You stupid fucking cunt!
Fuck!
Fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!
Fuck you!
- What?
- Donna, I'm very sorry that I yelled at you.
I shouldn't have done that.
But I'm only going to ask you
one more time to get me this number,
and if you don't, I'm gonna die.
- What?
- Please, I don't have time to explain.
- The number.
- Okay, hold on.
- Okay. State Department.
- Yeah.
- It's 202...
- 202.
- 134...
- 134.
- 4750.
- 4750?
- Yeah.
- Okay. Fuck you.
United States Department of State.
I'm an American citizen, working in Iraq.
I've been taken hostage.
- I need to speak to someone right away.
- Where are you calling from, sir?
From Iraq. I'm a truck driver.
I work for CRT. Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My convoy was attacked
and I'm being held for ransom.
- Are the kidnappers with you?
- No. I'm buried somewhere.
- You're buried?
- Yeah. Yeah, in a coffin.
It's a wooden box, an old wooden coffin.
Did you try contacting
the military out there?
They gave me a number to call,
a safety number.
- But the people took it.
- The people holding you hostage?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know.
- Hold on. Let me connect you...
- No, don't put me on hold! No!
- Rebecca Browning.
- Hello?
Yes, hello.
I was just informed of your situation.
Yeah, my situation.
I'm running out of time
and you guys keep putting me on hold.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry. Just help me.
I just have a few questions for you,
Mr. Conroy.
- You've got to be kidding me.
- It's important that I get this information.
- It'll help make a rescue attempt...
- Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait.
- How do you know my name?
- I'm sorry?
My name, I didn't give it to you.
I didn't give it to the other guy either.
What's going on right now?
We received a call from a representative
at CRT. You left him a message?
- Yeah?
- He contacted us right away.
So if you know what the hell is going on,
then what have you done
to get me out of here?
Well, there's little we can do
from Washington.
So that's it?
I'm just supposed to sit here and rot
because there's little you can do?
- No.
- Then what?
I need to know where you were
when your convoy was ambushed.
- In Baqubah, in the Diyala province.
- Okay.
And has contact been made
with the kidnappers?
Yeah. The guy says he wants $5 million
by 9:00 tonight.
Okay, or else...
Or else he'll take me to SeaWorld.
- What the hell do you think, lady?
- We'll do everything we can.
So you'll pay them then? Yeah?
- No. That we can't do.
- Wait, wait. Why?
It's the policy
of the United States government
to not negotiate with terrorists.
Not the policy
of the United States government?
Lady, come on!
You're sitting in an air conditioned office,
this is easy for you to say.
You're not the one stuck in a coffin,
buried in the goddamn desert!
- I understand your frustration...
- Frustration?
Lady, I'm going to fucking die in here.
Understand that?
- Hello?
- I'm here.
Then say something.
Tell me how you can get me out of here.
Okay.
What's the number on the phone
that you're calling from?
I don't know. Did it come up on your end?
No. It's listed as unavailable.
Tell me this, can you remember a number?
Yeah. No. I have a... I have a pencil.
- Okay, write this down.
- Okay, just a sec.
Okay. Go ahead.
- 410...
- Yeah.
...195...
- 5453.
- 5453.
- Who's that?
- That's Dan Brenner.
He's the commander
of the hostage working group over in Iraq.
Hostage working group?
Formed it in 2004 to deal
with situations such as yours.
Situations.
I love how you keep calling it that.
- Did you write down the number?
- Yeah.
Good. Now, just hold on,
I'll connect you with him now.
- He should be expecting you.
- What about the news? I wanna call them.
No, don't call the news.
- I repeat, do not contact the news.
- Why?
- It will only complicate things further...
- That's bullshit.
- You're just covering your own ass.
- No, I'm covering yours.
You don't go looking for something
you don't know is missing.
Everyone who needs to know about this does.
- I need all the help I can get.
- We are running out of time, Paul.
That's why you need
to contact Dan Brenner right away.
Fine.
I'm transferring you now.
- Brenner.
- Dan Brenner?
- Is this Paul Conroy?
- Yeah, yeah, it's me. It's Paul.
Paul, I was informed of what's going on.
I want you to know that we're already working
- on trying to get you out of there.
- Thank you, God.
I was told that we have until 9:00 p.m.
Is that right?
- That's what he said.
- All right.
That doesn't give us a whole lot of time.
And just so I have this right,
the kidnappers buried you in the ground?
Yeah. It's an old, wooden coffin.
Okay, my guess is that
since you're able to get a cell signal,
you're no more than a few feet underground.
- Yeah, I don't know. Maybe.
- What about battery life?
- How much does the phone have left?
- It's just less than half.
Okay, you have to conserve that battery.
Our best bet of finding you
is by tracking your cell signal.
- Is the ringer set on a sound or vibrate?
- Vibrate.
I need you to press
and hold down the asterisk key
to change it to a ring tone.
It will use less power.
- What about my Zippo?
- You have a lighter?
- Yeah.
- Use it to look around for markings,
- a logo, whatever you can find.
- Won't it use up oxygen?
Don't worry about that now.
Just try to find...
- it's just so dark in here without it.
- I understand, Paul.
Try to find anything in there that might
indicate where that coffin was made.
- You guys have to hurry.
- We're working as fast as we can, Paul.
Do you know if there were
any other survivors?
- From your convoy?
- Yeah.
Still unclear at this point.
I just wanted to do right by my family.
That's all.
I didn't know it was going to be
like this out here.
I don't think any of us did.
- That's him. He's calling.
- The kidnapper?
- Yeah. What should I do?
- You know his number?
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.
- Okay. What about the call?
- Give me the number first.
- He's going to hang up.
- Take the call.
- I... Okay.
- That's okay, just take the call.
Hello! Hello.
Two hour, four minute.
- You have to give me more time.
- You talk to embassy?
- Give the money?
- Yeah, yeah. I talked to someone.
The government.
They said that they won't pay the money.
- No pay?
- No.
They said they don't negotiate
with terrorists.
- Terrorists? I am terrorist?
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You're a terrorist, you son of a bitch.
- You terrified, so I am terrorist?
What did I ever do to you?
- Ever do?
- Yeah.
Yeah. I'm here because it's a job,
to make money.
- That's it.
- I have job until you come.
- Now my family have nothing.
- That's not my fault!
9/11 was not my fault, but you still here.
Saddam was not my fault, but you still here.
I told you, I'm only here to work.
To help rebuild.
Rebuild what you destroyed.
Stop! Stop! Just please, stop!
I'm just a guy. I'm just a truck driver. Okay?
I'm nobody that makes
decisions about anything.
I just want to go home.
Hello?
- You make video. Ransom video.
- Yeah, yeah!
I'll make a video.
If you let me go, I'll make a video.
No. You make video now.
- What? How?
- Use video on phone.
Near foot. You read note near foot in box.
- I don't see it.
- Near foot.
- Read note inside box.
- Okay, okay.
If I make the video, you let me go?
Only if we get money.
Nobody's going to pay $5 million for me.
We take less. One million, money.
If they pay, you'll let me go?
One million, money.
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!
We're sorry, your call cannot be completed.
Please, dial again.
Shit.
- Paul?
- Here's his number.
- Hold on. All right, go ahead.
- Okay. Hold on.
It's 07-902-24-921.
Okay. This is huge, Paul.
Unless they're using a cloned line,
we should be able to find
where this is coming from in minutes.
Okay. What about me?
Can you track my cell signal?
We're having a lot of trouble with yours.
Seems to be an EDS line, probably
through one of the Egyptian carriers.
What does that mean?
- That it's just not going to be easy.
- He wants me to make a ransom video.
No. Hold off for as long as you can.
If it gets me out of here, I'm making it.
The last thing we want is for this
to end up all over Al Jazeera.
- We?
- Yes.
This can't turn into
an international incident.
That's all you people care about, isn't it?
Don't you care about me?
- We do.
- What about me?
We do, Paul, we do. That's why we're here.
No, no, no, you don't!
You don't care about me.
You don't care about any of us.
I've had eight friends
killed out here, six of them today.
- Listen, Paul. You just...
- We don't have any guns, any armor.
- Nothing.
- That's because you're not soldiers.
Tell that to the people
who put me in this box!
Paul, listen.
Tell that to the people who shot my friends!
- We're doing the best we can.
- No, you're not! You're not!
- Okay, calm down.
- I've been out here nine months.
I know how it works. All you guys care about
is your secret plans
and your back-room politics.
You know, if I was a diplomat,
or a hostage working group leader,
or what the fuck your title is,
I'd be out of here by now.
But I'm not,
so I'm just supposed to sit in here,
- shut my mouth and die.
- Okay, I need you to stay focused, Paul.
Fuck you, Dan.
Paul, listen to me.
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line. And we're searching for you
just as hard as we would be
for a four-star general,
so don't literally waste your breath
suggesting otherwise.
I can't... I can't...
Are you injured, Paul? Are you okay?
I don't know. Who are they?
The people who put me in here, who are they?
They're just that, people.
- No different from you and me.
- I'm not a terrorist.
- Neither are they.
- How do you know?
If you were homeless, starving...
Actually, I take that back.
If your family was homeless and starving,
what would you do for them?
- I wouldn't kill somebody.
- How can you be sure?
What difference does it make?
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.
They don't care about anything
other than getting the money.
So pay them, just pay them.
Trust me, if it was an option,
I would do that in a heartbeat.
How many others have there been?
- Since I got here?
- Yeah.
Dozens. Journalists, contractors, soldiers.
Dozens have been taken. It's one of
the only functioning businesses out here.
How many have you rescued?
- How many?
- Not many.
- Tell me their names.
- No.
- Any of them.
- Who?
Make me believe
that they really do matter to you.
That they really do matter to you.
- Mark White.
- Who was Mark White?
A kid from New Hampshire.
Twenty-six years old. Med student.
Came over here to help out local doctors.
What happened to him?
- Insurgents grabbed him.
- When?
About three weeks ago.
- You remember his name?
- I remember all their names.
Is he... Did he?
Yeah. Yeah, he's alive.
- Where is he now?
- Home.
Probably happy to be back at school.
I want to get out of here.
We found him. We'll find you, too.
How?
We already have a solid lead
on the number you gave us.
- You do?
- Yeah. A unit's on its way over there now.
That's good.
- That feels good.
- Yeah.
What... What should I do in the meantime?
I know it's hard, but try to relax.
The more worked up you are,
the more air you're going to use.
Okay, I know.
I know. It's hard, 'cause I have anxiety.
I take pills for it.
Do you have them with you?
- Yeah.
- Good. Take them.
You need to preserve your oxygen level
any way you can.
Okay.
- Is your Zippo still lit?
- No, not anymore.
- All right. Good.
- I feel nauseous.
- You have to calm down.
- Okay.
And you need to save that battery.
We're expecting some intel
in about 10 minutes.
- Call me back then.
- Okay.
- Just hang in there, Paul.
- I'm trying, okay.
- What?
- You make video?
- No.
- You make video!
- Let me out and I'll make it.
- No!
- You make video now.
- I can't read the paper.
- Make video now!
- I can't.
I don't know what you want me to say.
I can't read the paper.
You make video! Now!
Fuck!
Okay, okay. Come on, come on, come on.
Come on!
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.
Fuck.
Shit.
Mountain View Nursing Home.
Hi. I was hoping that I could speak
with Maryanne Conroy, please.
Okay.
Let me bring the cordless phone
to her room. Hold on one moment, please.
Mrs. Conroy, you have a telephone call, dear.
Here, you can use this phone.
Hello?
Mom, it's Paul.
Who?
It's Paul, your son.
I have a son?
It's okay, Mom. How are you?
- I'm fine.
- That's good.
Who are you?
It's your son, Mom. It's Paulie.
- Paulie.
- Yeah.
Remember? Used to live on Colfax Street,

It is. It's Paulie.

- Very nice.
Your father and I have been
playing Gin Rummy every night.
Yeah.
I don't think Pop's there with you, Mom.
How are you doing, sweetie?
Not very good.
This might be the last time
that I talk to you.
That's nice, honey.
Did you get the flowers I sent you
a few months ago?
Flowers?
Yeah, I sent you... Never mind.
Look, I'm gonna get going now, okay?
I just wanted to call and talk to you.
I love you, Mom.
I said, I love you, Mom.
Do you want to tell me that you love me?
Yes, dear. Your father and I have been
playing Gin Rummy every night.
Okay, Mom.

- Yes. She has two kids.
I had five. Now only one.

- Wait! Wait!
- No, wait!

- Three...
- Okay! Okay! I'll make the video!
- Two, one!
I'll make the video! I'll make the video!
Please, please, please.
I have to hang up now to make the video.
Is that okay?
You have three minute to send video.
My name is Paul Conroy.
I'm an American citizen
from Hastings, Michigan.
I'm a civilian truck driver
for Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
And I have been taken hostage
somewhere in Iraq.
I need $1 million by 9:00 tonight,
Baghdad time,
or I'll be left to die here
in this coffin that I'm buried in.
I'm told that if the money is paid...
I'm told that if the money is paid,
I will be let go.
If it is not, I will be left to die here.
These threats are real
and will be followed through on.
Oh, my God.
I got you.
I got you, you motherfucker.
I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.
Fucking A. Okay.
Come on, come on, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.
Linda, I figured out the number
of the phone. I got it.
I got it.
Okay. It's 0792-42-884.
Use the international calling code
to dial it. I got it, baby.
I love you. Call me as soon as you get this.
Call me. I love you.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Okay.
Fuck. Come on.
Fuck.
My name is Pamela Lutti.
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda,
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.
Please. Please, don't!
My name is Pamela Lutti.
Please, don't!
If you're buried in a coffin,
where are you calling from?
The number you requested,
269-948-1998.
They're criminals, desperate ones at that.
They don't care about anything
other than getting...
At CRT,
we work with our clients to provide...
Sir, you're gonna have to stop shouting.
Five million, money, tonight, 9:00 p.m.,
or you stay.
Finding you is our primary concern.
Bottom line.
Thanks for calling the Conroys.
We're not home right now.
Please, leave a message after the beep.
Thanks!
Why the hell did you make that video?
- It's all a bunch of lies.
- What is?
What are you talking about?
- All of it.
- All of what?
You don't give a shit about any of us.
We're nothing to you people.
We're going to find you.
Fuck off, Dan. You're babysitting.
Just gonna stay on the phone
with me until I die.
Okay. You can't start breaking
on me now, Paul.
- You have to stay strong.
- They shot her and you didn't do anything.
We didn't even know she'd been taken hostage.
- She sent three videos.
- Yeah. That's what they told her to say.
- Why?
- I don't know.
What do you know?
That your ransom video already
has 47,000 hits on YouTube.
And all the major networks are playing it,
including Al Jazeera.
So now your captors have no choice
but to follow through.
I found out the number to this phone.
- How?
- Who cares?
I figured it out and you didn't. Why?
Because I didn't.
Just like you and every other person
on the planet,
there are some things I know,
and there are some things I don't.
Then how am I ever gonna get out of here?
Their signal was cloned, like we figured.
But we're close. Really close.
I'm near a mosque.
I heard a call to prayer over the PA.
Good. Good.
That means that we're in the right area.
You're...
You're nearby?
I spoke with soldiers from the 3rd ID
who were escorting your convoy.
They're alive?
Not all of them.
Both Bradley tanks were hit with IEDs.
The rest got caught in small arms fire.
What the hell happened out there, Paul?
Paul?
Wait.
Paul?
Fuck!
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Hello?
- Hello, who's there?
- Is this Paul Conroy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Paul. Who are you?
Paul, my name's Alan Davenport.
I'm the Personnel Director here
at Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
Yeah, yeah. I left you a message.
You did. I also heard from Rebecca Browning
over at the State Department.
Are you able to speak
on the status of your situation?
It's worse.
There was an explosion or something,
and the sand's coming through.
I probably have about half an hour
before it fills right up.
Slow down. You should try to stay calm.
So tell me something, Paul.
Who have you spoken to?
The hostage-takers, Dan Brenner
from the hostage working group...
Okay, Paul. I'm with you.
Now, how about the media?
I know your ransom video leaked,
but have you spoken directly to anyone
about what's going on?
- No. No, no, no, no.
- Good, good, good, good.
It needs to stay that way.
It's important we keep this situation
as contained as possible.
The situation is in a coffin!
I think it's pretty contained! Help me!
Help me!
What are you doing right now to help me?
I know you're upset.
But from what I've been told,
they're extremely close
to getting you out of there.
So hopefully, it won't be too much longer.
- Thank God.
- Yeah, thank God.
Now, I'm going to switch on a recorder
right now.
- What?
- Just a second.
This is Alan Davenport,
Personnel Director at
Crestin, Roland and Thomas Incorporated.
The date is October 23, 2006.
I'm speaking with Paul Conroy.
Mr. Conroy, are you aware that
I'm recording this conversation?
- What?
- Please answer the question.
- Shit.
- Mr. Conroy?
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And do I have your permission to do so?
Why do you need my permission?
What's this about?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
- Yes! Yes, all right?
- Thank you.
Now, Mr. Conroy, when were you hired by CRT?
I don't... Nine months ago. Around January.
What is all this?
I have your official date of hire
as January 4th.
- Is that correct?
- Who cares?
This is fucking crazy.
- January 4th. Is that correct?
- Yes!
And during your initial training,
before being sent to Iraq,
you were made aware of the dangers
inherent to the position
for which you were hired.
You mean when I came down there to Dallas,
and you guys said that all of the trucks
would be armored and have bulletproof glass?
You mean when you told us that things
were safer than ever over here?
Is that when... Is that
when I was made aware?
I need you to answer yes or no, please.
Yes.
During that time, did you also receive
and sign an employment contract with CRT,
which thoroughly explained company policy
as it pertained to
your specific terms of employment?
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I signed a bunch of things. Yeah.
- Yes or no?
- Yes! I signed the contract. Yes.
It's our understanding
that you were taken hostage in Iraq
two hours ago, is that also correct?
Yes! I think that's a fair assessment
of the situation, you fucking dick.
What's the point of all this?
Our legal department requires that
we obtain a sworn affidavit from employees,
confirming that they understand the reasons
for their forced separation from the company.
As of this morning, your employment
with CRT was officially terminated.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. What?
It was brought to our attention
that you were engaging
in relations with a fellow
CRT employee, Pamela Lutti.
- No. No, no. Hold on, hold on.
- Stipulated in your contract
was a fraternization clause,
in which it was stated quite clearly
- that any relationship...
- Stop, stop, stop. Please.
...be it romantic or sexual in nature...
- We were just friends.
- ...deemed inappropriate
by CRT senior officials
is grounds for immediate termination.
Hold on. Okay? We were just friends.
We were just friends.
- Our records indicate differently.
- Your records are wrong.
We're also legally required to inform you
that because you were technically no longer
under the employ of CRT
at the time of your abduction,
we cannot be held accountable for any injury
that may befall upon you after
your official date and time of termination.
Therefore, in your case,
that includes this incident,
or any consequences that may result from it.
What about my insurance money?
My family's gonna need that money.
Given that you were alive
up until the time of your termination...
Don't do this.
- Do you understand everything?
- Don't do this!
Do you understand
everything you've been told, Mr. Conroy?
Mr. Conroy?
You're a piece of shit.
That concludes our interview
with Paul Conroy.
I am now turning off the recorder.
You put me here.
I'm sorry.
Answer the phone. Answer the phone.
Come on. Why won't you answer the phone?
Paul, is that you?
They're dead.
- How do you know that?
- I just do.
Three F-16s leveled parts of the city
a few minutes ago.
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, that was fun for me.
Did they know I was here?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Did they care?
These people that took me, if they're dead,
they can't tell you where I am.
We can still try to track down your signal.
You tried that already.
We can try again.
- It's over, isn't it?
- No.
Yeah.
What should I do?
I don't know.
It's weird.
What is?
Knowing.
I wish this could have
gone differently, Paul.
Yeah.
Me, too.
My name is Paul Steven Conroy.
Social security number, 048-32-1198.
Date of birth, 3/23/76.
This video will serve
as my last will and testament.
To my wife, Linda Conroy,
I leave you the $700 in my personal savings,
and whatever's left in my annuity.
To my son, Shane Conroy,
I don't know.
I don't have... My clothes.
I leave you my clothes,
which you will grow into.
Not these ones.
I don't really have...
I wish that I had more for you, but...
Maybe if I was a famous baseball player,
or some guy who wore a suit to work...
Then I'd have more.
But, you know, you can be
one of those people if you want.
Yeah. Yeah.
Just promise me that when you get older
that you'll take good care of your mom.
And, I don't know.
You always try to do the right thing.
I love you very much, Shane.
Maybe I never said that enough.
Maybe I did. I don't know.
That probably means I didn't. And...
I'm sorry, Linda.
I should have listened to you.
You're not dead. Hello? Hello?
Where is money?
- I don't know.
- What don't know?
- I don't know where it is.
- Liar!
No, I'm not lying! I swear.
- Swear?
- Yeah, I swear.
- I'm telling the truth.
- From embassy.
- No.
- You get money now!
- I can't!
- You will!
- I need more time. Please.
- No more time!
There's sand pouring in here.
It's everywhere. Let me out of here,
and I promise you I will get you the money.
- You show blood.
- What?
- You show blood, they give money.
- No.
You cut finger, send video.
- No, I'm not doing that.
- Yes!
- No.
- No?
No, that's right, no. You let me out of here,
and I'll cut off
my whole goddamn hand if you want.
- You have wife?
- Yeah, I do.
And a son. I have a young son.
And I want to see them again. Please, sir.
- Sir?
- Yes. Sir.
I say that out of respect to you.
243, North Walnut Street.
Hastings, Michigan, USA.
That's my... Why did you say that?
You show blood, or they show blood.
No. You're nobody, all of you.
You can't get to them.
- No?
- No.
You're peasants.
You're fucking criminals, that's all.
You don't even know where Michigan is.
Detroit. Ann Arbor.
You looked at a map. You looked at a map.
You show blood, or they show blood.
Send video by five minutes.
Hi, this is Linda. Please leave a message.
Thanks and have a great day.
Linda! Linda, listen to me,
you and Shane have to go somewhere, okay?
Do not go back to the house.
Do not go back to the house.
Just go anywhere but to the house.
Okay? These guys, they know where we live.
They have my driver's license.
Just go to the sheriff's station
if you have to, just do not go home.
Holy God.
Fuck.
This is Daniel Brenner.
Please leave a message at the tone.
Brenner, where are you?
The guy's still alive!
He just called me. He's still alive.
Fuck.
They can't find them. They can't.
There's no way. No, no, no, no, no.
They can't find them. They can't find them.
They can't find them.
Fuck.
My name is Pamela Lutti.
I'm a food service worker at FOB Anaconda,
employed by Crestin, Roland and Thomas.
My captors' requests have gone unanswered.
Please. Please, don't!
Fuck.
- Around to the other side!
- Move it, move it, move it!
I see him! Move it!
Get back! Everybody, get back!
Civilian has been located.
Civilian has been located.
Are you okay? Talk to me.
Paul, are you okay?
Yeah?
Paul? Paul, it's Brenner.
- Are you there, Paul?
- I'm here?
We're coming for you now. You hear me?
We know where you are.
- You're coming?
- We are, Paul.
- We're almost there now.
- How do you know?
Coalition forces picked up
a Shi'ite insurgent just outside of Baghdad.
Said he knew where
an American was buried alive.
He agreed to show us where if we let him go.
- You're coming for me?
- We are practically there already.
- You have... You have to hurry.
- We are, Paul.
You have to hurry. The sand... The sand...
You just hang in there three more minutes.
This will all be over soon, I promise, Paul.
Okay. Okay. I believe you.
Three minutes, Paul. I just need
you to hang on for three minutes.
- Thank you.
- This will all be over soon. I promise you...

- No, no, no! Paul, Paul, Paul!
- Call me right back. Please!
- No, wait, Paul!
Linda! Linda!
Paul? Paul, is that you?
- Tell me it's you.
- It's me.
Oh, my God, Paul! What are they doing to you?
- Please tell me you're okay.
- I'm okay.
I just saw the news.
I left my cell phone at home.
They know where I am.
They're coming to get me.
The Americans are coming for me.
- They are?
- It's going to be okay.
Thank God. Thank God.
They're coming. They're on their way.
It's gonna be okay.
I was so afraid I was going to lose you.
- You're not.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.
I love you so much. I'm so sorry.
I should never have come here.
I should have listened to you. I'm sorry.
Sweetie, I don't care. I just want you home.
Please come home to me.
I'm coming home. I'm coming home.
- Swear it.
- I swear.

- Swear it again.
I swear! I have to go.

- Move! Move! Let's go!
- Brenner?
- Okay, Paul? Paul? We're here!
- It's me.
- He brought us right to you.
Hurry, hurry. You have to hurry.
It's almost full. Please.
Paul, just hang in there.
We're right above you.
I can't. I can't. Are you close?
- We're almost there!
- Are you close?
We're almost there! Right above!
- Please! Please! I can't hear you!
- Keep digging!
- I can't hear you! Where are you?
- We're almost there!
Keep digging! We see the coffin.
Yeah, dig in...
- Hang in there!
- Please open it. Please open it.
Let's go! Move! Faster guys, faster!
- Hurry up! Hurry!
- Okay, okay, clear!
Fucking hurry! Please!
Hurry!
Oh, my God.
- What? What?
- Oh, my God.
- I'm so sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.
- What is... What?
It's Mark White.
He brought us to Mark White.
Oh, God. Oh, God
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Okay.
Okay. Oh, God.
I'm sorry, Paul. I'm so sorry.
