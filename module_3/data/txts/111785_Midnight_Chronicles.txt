Here we are.
Freedom.
Dorosul!
You all try to remove it.
Was it painful...
trying?
My faith is done,
I will not return.
The Shadow cannot be embraced,
and then cast aside.
A Legate can not turn
from his call.
Why do you do this?
You are his...
forever.
Amusing.
I return you...
to Izrador.
Countless ages ago, the dark god
Izrador was cast out of heavens..
and banned to the wastes
of the Earth.
With his fall
a great vail decented.
Separating the mortal world
from the heavens...
separating the gods
from their creation.
Izrador, the Shadow of the North...
gathered about him creatures
of evil and darkness.
He lashed out in conquest,
against the free races of the world.
Led by Aradil the Witch Queen of the Elves
the free races repelled his attacks.
But Izrador was not defeated.
In the third war the Dark Gods
struck against the South again.
This time the free races
were caught unprepared.
This time, the Dark Lord won.
Now the lands are clutched
in the iron hand of occupation,
The Legates... black priests
and servants of Izrador...
govern the lands
fom the city of Teros Obsidia.
Like a retreating tide,
hope and magic fade from the world.
It has been a hundred years
since the Shadow fell.
Relax?
Next you'll be asking me
to meditate?
No one made you wait under the stench
of hemp collared elf all day.
We suffer so that the Shadow
may be strong.
We chased that errant alter boy
half way across Eredane.
A fortnight's rest in a pleasure district,
is that to much to ask?
- Rest?
- Where?
Diverson.
One night, Kruce.
Then we return Teros Obsidia.
Now, now...
Who's that?
So far from the Tower, Chuzara?
Geddon send word to you, Mag.
I should like to give that old crow
a word or two myself.
Who's the leech?
Ooh, aren't we pleasent?
Forgive, Kruce,
his honesty is useful.
Albeit at times...
inappropriate.
You're to accompany me
to the village of Blackweir...
to complete the temple there.
Mundane work for Redeemer,
don't you think?
- I'm surprised that Geddon...
- And to require...
as to the fate of Tosh Kamar.
The leget gone missing.
I see.
What about the night
in the pleasure distict, Mag?
Mag!
Concerns over that northland prophecy
are overblown, Geddon.
The First Legate
does not take them seriously.
I have no doubt
that Sunulael is correct...
As he is in all things.
Still, there are members of the council
who feel differently.
One mustn't ignore any threat
against the Shadow.
No matter how unlikely that may be.
Of course not.
Yet, this fairy tale notion, of some
prophetic hero rising against us...
- is really quite childish.
- If you will... forgive me.
- I must prepare for my journey.
- But sill no word...
of the Legate gone missing
in the borderlands?
Have you no duties elsewhere, Haarn?
Tosh Kamar was sent to complete
that temple nearly 5 years ago, Geddon.
Our time runs short.
You may tell Sunulael that the fate
of Tosha Kamar will soon be known...
and that Blackweir temple
will be completed.
Splendid. He will be pleased.
May I ask who have you sent
to complete this formidable task?
A young leget...
One who has never failed me.
Who goes there?
A servant of the Shadow has come.
Open the gate.
Take what's useful...
burn the rest.
Four wagons.
He was right again.
Yes he was.
We owe much to this informant.
He says the mayor holds you...
holds us responsible for the heavy taxes.
Any thinking person in Blackweir,
knows the value of Lesher's accusations.
Better to be taxed by her,
than have a Legate temple
build in their midst.
I suppose you would know.
I wish I did not.
Now... go.
Oh, you always bring me
to the most cheerful places, Mag.
I expect by the time I die, I'll have seen
every dung heap west of the Kaladrun.
Unlike the others, Kruce, you are free
to leave my service at any time.
Oh, but then I would miss
your splendid company and...
your spectacular destinations.
We're not here for revelry, Kruce.
Not every task leads to the Lord's bliss.
How's about just one, eh?
One task that leads to a little bid
of bliss, or at least...
one leading to a place that doesn't
smell like fish, or the insides of a boro.
To tell the truth...
I prefer the smell of fish.
I go where Geddon sends me.
Ho-ho. And if Geddon had a pipe
we'd never stop dancing.
I say we find this missing Legate
with haste, my talents are wasted here.
What talent?
Pissing from a saddle?
Oh! The acolite deigns
to speak to me!
My dear, I speak of an intuition
verging on the unnatural.
Razor wit, an unparalleled
sense of class, decendy...
Oh, by the holy black bastard.
This miserable hole
actually has a tavern.
If you'll excuse me,
I have a thirst.
You know what you are
tasked to do.
Aye. And you know my devotion
to duty is unsurpassed...
which is why, if you're seeking me,
I'll be in that tavern...
fortifying myself with a bottle
and a woman.
Perhabs... two of each.
Pig.
I know what little praise is given
to those who bring back our lost.
I'm afraid, I've trained you
for a thankless duty, Mag.
You have taught me that the glory belongs
to the Shadow in the North.
To ask the name of my pray...
No more.
Haam suggests that age
is dulling my abilities...
so, I hope you'll prove to him
that he's mistaken.
Wait!
This is no Legate symbol.
Explain!
- I don't know what it is.
- You don't know?
It started to appear last winter.
I was wary of asking the healers.
A Redeemer...
showing weakness?
Of course.
Don't concern yourself, Mag.
We'll discuss it when you return.
As you say.
Bie Rial!
This temple is not abandoned.
A Legate still claims dominion here...
Even in death.
A soul remains?
I seek another.
The last of us to dwell in this place.
Something else walks among you.
Something old.
Something... strong.
What did he say?
There are many spirits here.
Mad with terror.
But Tosh Kamar...
is not among them.
I offer tithe
from Landring Farm, Magistrate.
It's near the village of Fernglade.
Tithes from the forest villages
have been dismal.
I hope this "hunter"
hasn't foolishly emboldened you people...
to withhold your dues.
That would be a tragic...
mistake,
if you take my meaning.
Liana!
Liana?
I can't talk, Gaelen.
Don't follow me.
It's been years.
I can't let you go again
without some kind of exlanati...
Go home, Gaelen.
Doros Gharuck.
I come into this dark...
to relieve you of your call.
Oso...
Isharam... Nosfo.
Doros Ushaan!
I claim this place.
Oso... Izra... Jemez.
Barash!
Return... now...
to the Shadow in the North!
They have gone to Izrador.
This temple...
passes to me.
And what may the town mayor do
for our master builder?
I told you I'd flay you children
if you ever came to me in the open.
Someone has come.
Someone?
A Legate...
From the tower.
You told me the Tower wouldn't send
another priests so soon.
I don't think this is
an ordinary priest, Lesher.
Perhaps we have delayed the construction
of the temple for too long.
Even with the outlaw attacks...
I fear our excuses have run thin.
- Perhaps we should...
- Has that Legate...
stolen your manhood, Dolan?
'Cause I assure you... if you give me cause
to doubt your loyalty, I will.
How many more chickens
will your pens hold?
The capacity of my pens
is none of your concern.
I will decide
when our enterprise is complete.
And you wil keep informing me
of those temple supply caravans.
But above all, Dolan...
you'll hold your tonque
and leave this Legate to me.
May I ask a question?
Would that I could guarantee
all the answers.
How many have you killed?
Traitors, you mean...
Fallen Legates.
Eight.
I have raptured eight.
How do you feel...
to kill another Legate?
When one casts aside
the grace of the Shadow.
Becomes pale...
from that moment
he is no longer a Legate.
What do you read in the flames, Deleth?
I was looking inward,
not out.
If you say so.
Your raid...
It was a success?
Where are the elves?
Your companions?
They have returned to Caradul.
We've placed your provisions over there.
But you stayed?
I have another task here.
Here?
In Blackweir.
What could an elf
possibly want there?
Forget I ask.
There is something you should know.
Another Legate has arrived in Blackweir.
This is ill tidings.
You are sure?
You have seen this Legate?
It has been years...
since I did this.
Sometimes... before the storm comes,
I can feel it again.
Feel... His call.
His mark.
I can feel it now.
There is a prophecy, Chuzara.
It foretells the rise of an enemy...
in this, the Last Age.
One that will threaten the dominion
of our lord.
A formidable warrior...
It is written that the earth, that...
Arith herself, cries out for him.
You never sent word.
Who is this?
An old friend.
Forgive me.
Friend?
Most of the people in the village
believe you're dead.
My mother still lights a candle for you
in the spring.
Sometimes hard things
must be done, Gaelen.
Leaving is easy.
It's the staying behind...
that's hard.
We had a life.
A life... standing in line
to pay tithes to the Tower.
A life... staring at the ground
in fear when an orc walks by!
This is the life you want?
It is what we have.
Gaelen, why did you follow me
this time?
Why couldn't you have followed me
last time when I needed you to?
My parents helped raise you as a child,
would you have me abandon them?
For months I lay sleepless
wishing you had come with me.
I still wish that.
I still can't.
I bring you the town mayor, Your Grace.
And the master builder.
Welcome to Blackweir, Your Grace.
Lesher Noga, at your service.
Enjoing the view, Crawlis?
Thinking of... flying away?
Is she here?
She's with the Legate.
It is true, then.
The long arm of the Tower reaches
in to Lesher's little nest once more.
I wonder if it knows of the...
vipers that live in her walls.
How could you afford a book,
anyway?
Some things are not bought.
If the Legate saw such contraband
it would be the death of us.
What do you want, Magistrate?
You could start
by telling me how an assassin...
comes to know
the forbidden craft of letters.
Lesher teach you?
- Careful.
- Is that a threat, Crawlis?
Yes.
The Shadow will gain
foothold here, Crawlis. It's inevitable.
You think that Lesher will remain
in Blackweir when that happens?
You seem to have such firm grasp
of the future.
The wind changes, Crawlis.
You may want to...
reconsider your allegiances.
when that book of yours
is burned.
And you with it.
Let's not mention the word "book"
to the Legate.
What sort of Legate is he?
There are many Legate orders...
but I never seen such as him.
I could've bathed in your cowardice
back there. You reek of fear.
As should you... Soon enough
they willl know what we have done.
The stories of Blackweir, Dolan...
are not merely ghost stories.
told to children by firelight.
I know.
Then hold your tonge.
Be patient.
As with the others...
our new guests
will meet their fate here.
Those two seem to have prospered
in the absence of a Shadow church.
Yet their town has not.
This local legend they spoke of.
The outlaw the call the "Hunter".
Is he importand?
Perhaps.
There's smoke rising on the Greenroad.
I may assume
they received our information?
As always.
And still, they exhibit no concern
regarding it's source?
They never ask...
They trust me, Lesher.
Simpletons.
But still, why should they not?
The wagons I've placed before them,
could've fed a small army.
Indeed, that's just they've done.
You, uh... met with the new Legate?
Thats none of your concern.
How can I not be concerned, Lesher?
A representative of the Tower
is hardly a trifling matter.
If your so eager for something
to occupy your mind...
set yourself to moving the last
of the goods to my holdings in Eisin.
Prepare for the journey quickly
and need I say... with stealth.
It's hardly necessary
that I undertake this myself.
- The orcs...
- It's necessary...
if you are still interested
in receiving your tenth.
Now leave me!
I did it for my family.
What I did here.
I did it for them.
If you're speaking of missing tithes,
or the fact that only you knew
the details of the supply caravans.
I'm afraid you've already been found out.
I will pay for my crimes.
But there is something I can offer you.
In exchange for the safety of my family.
The families of traitors...
are sent to Steel hill.
This is a death sentence.
When no work remains in them...
they will die.
There is something
that you need to know... A secret!
You shall have it...
if you show mercy to my family.
And why should your secret
be worth... such a price?
Because...
you're in danger here.
Might I hazard that the meeting
with the Legate did not go well?
He ordered me to round up the townsfolk,
to help Dolan finish that temple.
Told me to work them to death
if necessary.
The dead are not so good
about paying taxes.
This Legate, Mag Kiln...
has a different look
from those who come before.
He asks questions...
about the others... about the past.
The builder said
he was... no ordinary priest.
Regardless of what he is
he won't last long here.
None have.
Like the ones that came before.
This town will devour him.
Quality craft...
Elven make.
I know the look of Elven arrows...
What else?
Well... location like this here...
lovely little spot for an ambush.
These outlaws,
they must've known they were coming.
He was here...
I can smell him.
I believe that'd be roast orc.
While this Legate remains,
We must cease our more
delicate dealings,
grovel... and pledge
our undying loyalty...
to the Tower.
At least your groveling
is already accomplished.
Don't mock me, Crowlis.
Only one thing concerns me:
A weak link in our chain of devotion
to the Tower.
- An Elven knife?
- Of course!
Everyone knows that the Hunter
is supplied by the elves.
And he's a murderous roque...
capable of the most heinous deeds.
The best thing now...
maybe head back townwards
See if anyone knows
anything about this "Hunter".
Seems to me... I recall some loose talk
back at the tavern about...
Now where you going?
That isn't the way to the tavern.
Good work, Gaelen.
Can't recall how many times
I've had to hang up this shield.
How many times must you fall?
What is it, Gaelen?
A girl?
It's nothing.
And Izador's a sugar beet.
Did you pay our tithe?
I did.
And?
Pa, in the hanging square
in Blackwear... I saw Liana.
- They hung her?
- No, no no, I saw her in the crowd.
Knew it was a girl.
So, our little Liana
comes back again.
I always liked her.
Spine and lip, leathal concoction.
She's joined the Hunter.
I'm glad to hear it, Gaelen
Morrec's a good man.
It doesn't matter!
Morrec needs good men.
You're a good man, son.
You got the blood of Erenland in you.
- Strong.
- So I shoud just leave, huh?
Leave a blind man
to take care of a farm?
You'll starve before the chickens, Pa.
The Shadow took my eyes, Gaelen,
not my heart.
Don't accept him.
That what he wants.
- What he needs.
- And how would you know that?
I know that you don't wanna stay here
to rot with us!
That you believe
that the day will come again.
Say it!
The day will come again.
See that it does.
What is it?
I don't know.
Powerful magic
was once wrought in this place.
Here.
This script seems to be repeated.
What does it say?
This is the only way?
You go first.
A few years ago... I came down here
to check the temple foundations.
And that...
is when I found this.
Have you ever wondered,
why this temple was never complete...
even after a hundred years?
Corrupt fools such as you
never hastened it's consecration.
The Legate Order is everywhere.
Why not here in Blackweir?
Why indeed.
I never told anyone about this place.
I never dared.
Legates!
Dolan. Dolan, what is this?
You rush us here with holy haunches
on fire, and you won't tell me why?
I told you. Chuzara's in danger.
Your broken stone told you this?
Lord's Legate!
Why, your stone was right, Mag.
Chuzara's been eaten by a pirate.
Who are you?
I'm the town's magistrate,
Your Grace.
Know that Blackweir has hungered...
- for the Shadows return...
- Spare me.
I only wish to make my humble services
available to Your Grace.
I have no time for your services,
Magistrate.
Your Grace I...
Your Grace, I come with information!
I know of crimes against the Tower!
Find Chuzara.
Be careful.
I'll find her.
Convinced me
you're not wasting time.
Blackweir's been enthralled
to Mayor Lesher for almost a decade.
You should know that she's been skimming
the temple tithes for years.
And you think a Legate
would not know this?
But there is more! She's been purposely
delaying the construction of this temple,
biding herself more time to steal.
She's insidious.
Don't lie, Magistrate.
The delay are caused by rogue attacks
on temple supplies.
I know this.
She forces the builder to tell her
of those caravans.
Then she brings word to the Hunters.
Lesher knows the Hunter?
She uses one of my men
as an informent.
I don't believe the Hunter
knows the true source.
That Lesher's using him.
Lesher is not as clever
as you give her credit for.
I'm sure I don't understand.
Suffice to know the Tower
has keen interest in finding this man.
Then let me help you find him!
I'm afraid growing another eye
is beyond my powers, Magistrate.
When you've finished with Lesher,
Blackweir will need a mayor.
One loyal to the Tower.
Going for a nice threesome?
Who inquires?
Sword of Theros Obsidia.
High Legate Order.
Shadow in the north,
so on and so forth.
Well, if it isn't the Legate's
little servant.
I'm surprised you're not at the tavern,
imbiding every wet thing about.
Yes, my bones ache for it.
But you see, the guy in black
breathes duty down my neck.
Horrible thing.
Especially after he's had onion.
So sad for you.
What'd you say... a trip to the temple?
Meet the Legate?
I'm afraid it's too late to play.
Now, now, now, it's clear
you 3 can't wait to cut up together.
But, I'm afraid
the Legate wants to see you.
Now.
Mayor Lesher will hear of this.
Hm...
indeed she will.
Who's there?
Crawlis?
He's lying!
Remarkable!
Only a profound judge of character
could penetrate my cunning duplicity.
Shut your noise hole, weasel.
And so eloquent!
A lost child of the Elthedar for sure,
yet so hideous a visage.
- You're dead... Shadow whore!
- Wait!
Here I thought
it was too late to play.
Your friend isn't sticking around
for a last swig, I suppose?
No? No?!
Alright then.
What do you want?
Well, let's see.
To never again smell another
god-forsaken backwater hamlet.
To suckle on woman, wine,
and a greasy boar...
until my knots give up their ghost.
- Preferably somewhere warm...
- What does the Legate want?
Who am I to know
the mind of a Legate?
So, you're gonna come along willingly,
or a body shorter?
Lesher will hang your entrails
from the town walls!
Well it's understandable
she would want to, uh...
showcase the size of my manhood.
And my question?
Willingly.
Good choice.
The air is heavy tonight.
Something stirs.
I renounce you!
I purge myself... of you!
Why are you here?
Leave me.
No more words.
I must do this alone.
I was told that your kind
vanished from this land long ago.
We do not perish so easily.
You killed them.
The others.
They still haunt this place.
And you shall join them, Legate.
In that.
You are to late.
Kill me if you must!
But you kill a free man, not a Legate.
The old man insisted
he could turn you.
Live then.
Wait!
They will hunt me.
Yes, he does not forgive.
They will know me by this.
A tarnish
that can never be washed away.
Perhaps, not washed.
Ah, I can not tear the Shadow
from your soul.
No. Toward that end,
I will devote the rest of my life.
You looked inward?
We call it dreaming.
Seems unpleasant.
Sometimes.
You well?
What brings you from Blackweir, Doucan?
- Has your beer run dry?
- The customers have run dry, Hunter.
What's happened?
The Legate... He's arrested Lesher,
and he's begun hanging the townsfolk.
What?
I thought you should know.
Wherever the Legates go,
the gallows are well fed.
It's me he's after.
Search everyone
who enters or leaves this town.
Of course.
Hang three every hour,
until the Hunter is delivered to me.
You think me unjust?
On the contrary...
I am merciful.
Dornish cities have been razed
to the ground for lesser crimes.
When I am mayor,
I can assure you that Blackweir...
will be unrivaled in it's loyalty
to the Tower, Your Grace.
You have made a wise choice.
An Elven knife.
Clever ruse.
Clever, Your Grace?
But the outlaws
are supplied by the elves.
I grow weary of your lies, Lesher.
This town... must have seemed
a ripe plum, waiting to be picked.
No church...
no Legate to answer to.
A murderous wretch from the streets
of Eisen, could rise far in such a place.
- Even to the office of mayor.
- Spare my life, Your Grace.
I can be of use to you...
Perhaps you can.
Towns like these,
attract the worst sorts.
Idealists and rogues both.
But there is...
a darker secret here,
is there not?
Something only a cunning rat like you
must've felt.
I'm sure, I... don't know.
- Then you are no use to me.
- No! Wait!
Tell me about the dead Legates.
Tell me what Dolan knew!
I only know tales... Ghost stories,
told by the small folk.
I welcome you into this dark.
By Your Grace,
I walk under His Shadow.
You have travelled with speed,
old friend.
The Ones Who Watch, gave news
of your coming only a fortnight ago.
Yet, they did not give word
of your purpose.
Raynn, Sanulael's church
may be nearing it's end.
Speak softly! The allies
of First Legate are everywhere.
You've heard of this new prophecy?
The northern devout fear it forebodes
the rise of a great enemy.
I believe it also foretells the return
of the one we've awaited.
How can that be?
The ritual... Except for our one failure,
are all dead.
What if we did not fail?
Does she still live?
Her vigor surprises even me.
Ah! I should've known
you came for her!
But... it is good to see you
in Sharuun again, old friend.
Let her stand there, until she
remembers something useful.
Or until she puts
an end to it herself.
- Will the Hunter come?
- They always come.
What if... this outlaw
somehow captured Tosh?
Outlaws capturing a Legate?
Unlikely.
I wonder...
why so hopeful, Chuzara?
Kruce said you found something
in the forest.
Something which send you back
with speed.
I worried for your safety.
It was foolish
to follow the builder, Chuzara.
- How did you know?
- Do you remember the temple ghosts?
Do you remember their warning?
In the forest
I found something unsettling.
A ravaged monolith.
It seem to have been built...
by Legates
during the first Shadow War.
Ancient runes coverd it.
Runes of warning.
I could only make out
one repeated word.
Yes?
The word was "prisoner".
Do elves never sleep?
Not in the way as humans.
We are children of both sun and stars.
- Where's Morrec?
- Of course...
- there is little of either in this place.
- Deleth!
He left in the night.
I thought you were his friend!
- Friend?
- He's turning himself in, Deleth.
To stop the hanging!
He did not say that.
Liana... don't be foolish.
You do not know Morrec's intentions.
How can you know mine?
What're you doing?
I sense we are
traveling in the same direction.
For a hundred years,
they came to this place.
To their doom.
Some power wards this door.
What could have the strength...
to slaughter Legates like this?
One that Legates sought to bind
in a monolith, long ago.
One that has yet
to show itself.
I wonder what other secrets
lie beneath this town.
The First Watcher is resting.
She's not to be disturbed.
I have travelled from the Tower
to see her.
I know. Yet even the First Legate
has been turned away fom this sanctuary.
How long have you served her?
For five years
I have been her eyes.
Then I ask you to do something
for the first time in five years.
I ask you to interrupt
her rest.
Shai...
It's good to see you well.
What shade of black
are you these days, Geddon?
Why do you walk sleepless
on the battlements?
The moonlight reminds you
of your brother perhaps?
- A white stain on your night.
- What do you know of my brother?
Not just a brother,
a twin brother!
His memory
haunts your every reflection.
He's dead.
Long ago, by my hand.
When you have looked into his glass
long enough, Geddon.
many unseen thing are laid bare.
Hearts of men. Lies of men.
Lies men tell themselves.
I came here for your council.
Not to discuss my brother.
One day the Tower will gain a foothold
in Blackweir, Grimnor. It is inevitable.
Nothing is inevitable.
You of all men know this.
Yet it seems unlikely that this
young Legate will be reformed...
by any whispers to his conscience.
Morrec... after all these years,
you must suspect that there is something,
in Blackwear I've pledged to protect,
something that the Tower cannot have.
He sent a dream...
which drew me to this place.
The Legates imprisoned him here...
in this rock.
For two thousand years
he was trapped here.
Since the Shadow fell, he has helped me
to hide that which must remain hidden.
- Now his time has come again.
- Not only his.
Blackweir has strong roots.
The earth still remembers
a noble past.
There is a place, a covenant place,
where the Shadow is weak.
We will need your help.
I'm going to Blackweir, Deleth.
I know.
And how is traveling with an elf
going to help me?
The orcs receive double rations for every
pointed ear they nail to the town gates.
It seems that folly
has found company.
He would do the same for me.
Yes, but he'd find another way.
Getting killed won't help him...
Or avenge your family.
He told you that?
Hi did...
Though he need not have.
It is plain that hard years
are among your few.
Ven Haag found this manuscript
in an abandoned keep...
in the mountains
north of the march.
A youg girl once served there.
In the winters the frost,
would cling thick to the walls.
And she would press her hand into ice
until she could bear it no more.
She could see her reflection there.
Ah, she was beautiful then.
You?
Before my watch...
Before his death.
He would sit for hours,
not feeling the wind, looking south.
Dreaming of a Legate order,
that would never be.
It will be.
This says he will rise again!
And that this shall be his mark.
Bei Rial.
You have to leave your bow
before we get to town.
An elf never abandons his weapon.
You'll have to make an exception...
It's too conspicuous.
I think you underestimate
the guile of the elves.
No, not that way.
What was that?
I was told never to go there...
That it's dangerous.
This is a journey
meant for a dwarf.
One shouldn't commune with the
dark powers on an empty stomach.
Leave me, Kruce.
What is this place?
We will rise again.
Bei Rial.
Deleth, dont!
The elves have learned
never to hesitate their blade.
Tell me the wisdom
of hesitating now?
I came back for you.
I'm here to rescue a man, Gaelen,
This is not a game.
Would you still have me
come with you?
Liana, we must go.
You what?
What is that?
Elf.
Help, elf!
Elf!
Elf!
They're coming.
- Give me your bow.
- An elf never abandons...
- his weapon!
- Do as he ask, Deleth.
He was trained by the same man as I.
- Gaelen.
- Go.
Why the pacing, Chuzara?
Are you in heat?
Too hot for me.
You know, I prefer my women
less deadly.
Or dead, more likely.
Trouble?
Care to guess, who that is?
They'll kill him.
There is another way.
A better way.
Chuzara.
Tosh.
When no word came,
I thought you've been killed by elves.
But this is worse...
I'm here with Mag Kiln.
Geddon's butcher.
Why, Tosh?
To turn pale...
To renounce the Shadow,
is to forfeit your life.
Everything.
You were not alway so enthralled,
to the doctrine.
Or did you forget... our time was
quite strictly forbidden?
How could you confuse the love-play
of two novices with this... heresy?
Cast aside that yoke, Chuzara!
It is a hard life without him,
but a true one.
To choose between you...
and my god?
If you think you can even tempt me,
this temptation, you are a fool.
It is Izrador who pays you
for the fool, Chuzara.
You and and all the others!
Or do you think the Shadow cares for you?
You are dead to me...
Hunter.
Even if so...
when I saw you there...
back in the courtyard...
for a moment I wished,
he had chosen someone else.
I would not hurt you now.
Is that supposed to be a threat?
Mag.
I know. He's here.
She's still alive.
Stay with her.
Be on your guard
Someting ails you?
The northern stars
lie in the Shadow...
The southern stars
must shine for them.
Grimnathaleth.
Come in, Lord Domosuuran.
And you as well, Liana.
This is a dire night to be about.
Do I know you?
A dire night indeed.
The harbinger shall come
into the lair of the beast.
And there he shall open himself
to the past.
I knew you would come, Legate.
Tosh Kamar!
Izrador reclaims you.
Tosh Kamar is dead.
You cannot win.
You afraid of the farmer, frog-face?
This charade ends now.
Grimnor was right.
You would follow me straight to your doom.
Legate pride...
I knew it well.
Legates bound you centuries ago.
- How did you escape their prison?
- I was freed by your enemy.
Dorosul!
We were born from the same breath,
your master and I.
He has little power over me
in this covenent place.
And in the shadows of the Shadow,
he shall dance with the beast.
And the will know him for what he is...
and for what he will become.
Legates imprisoned him here,
in this rock.
Ancient runes covered it,
runes of warning.
Oh, he's far to wild and dangerous
to be allowed to take shape for long.
What could have the strength,
to slaughter Legate like this?
You've heard of this new prophecy?
I could only make out one repeated word.
He would stand for hours.
The word was "prisoner".
Not feeling the wind,
looking south...
Dreaming of a Legate order
that would never be.
Who are you?
Bei Rial.
We shan't be long, Merriam.
Lord Domosuuran.
Liana.
This sanctuary
will soon succumb to the north.
Grimnathaleth...
The guardian has been destroyed, Deleth.
And those who walk twice,
shall gather on the land...
like the locust swarms of Farodun.
And that shall be a portent
to his return.
If you're right, this first sign
will soon come to pass.
Where now, Legate?
To find this someone
who has never failed me.
Only a... Night King would have the power
to destroy an Elder One.
Not even a Night King
could have done this.
- Grimnathaleth, who killed the guardian?
- This Legate. This Mag Kiln.
Not even the entire Legate Coven
that imprisoned him...
- could destroy him!
- How could single Legate?
This is no ordinary Legate.
He is the harbinger...
Then it has begun.
You two enjoy speaking in riddles?
You should know we're here to free
the Hunter, kind sir.
He may be dead by now.
Yes, of course Liana.
If it eases your mind, I can tell you
that Morrec is not dead.
Not yet.
Who are you?
You don't remember, do you?
I remember...
a young girl...
dirty, cold, running in the woods,
running from the...
tragedy behind her.
There was a man in the woods.
He took you
to where there was food.
Sourberries, I think.
He held you until you...
were warm.
It was you.
You sang to me,
beneath a great tree.
John Socar's tree.
And then you fell asleep.
When I woke,
you were gone.
But someone found you, yes?
A very important person...
a boy.
Gaelen.
I left Gaelen above
with orcs.
I doubt that his fate
is in the hands of mere orcs.
Gaelen has a journey ahead of him,
that can't be missed, you see?
Grimnathaleth.
Do you mean Liana friend is...
All in good time, Lord Domosuuran.
I've heard of books.
I thought such things were all destroyed
by the Shadow long ago.
Most were... some good men and woman
saved what they could...
brought them here and hid them
from our northern foes.
They must be very valuable.
Even a few of these books could buy
Blackweir and all that's in it, Liana.
This is a treasure, then!
More than a treasure.
Here...
is the soul of a people...
The knowledge of generations.
here it awaits...
for the day to come again.
