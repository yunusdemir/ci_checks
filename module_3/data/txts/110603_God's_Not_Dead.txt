<font face="Comic Sans MS">When it's coming apart, you had it all</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't enough</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not enough</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They tell you it's not worth the price</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So just let it go</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you know you can't</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know you won't</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not easy, no, finding the words to say</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're feeling lost, you'll find your way</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the angels, they brought you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They see the fear in your eyes</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Heart sinks like a stone</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause when you're afraid, it weighs on your soul</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When the timing is right, somehow you'll know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When nobody stands, stand on your own</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not easy, no, finding the words to say</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you're feeling lost, you'll find your way</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the angels, they brought you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna hold you up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Name?
- Wheaton. Josh Wheaton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got your
pre-registration sheet?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All core requirements are here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is your humanities elective?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philosophy 150.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Radisson, 11:00 on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to think about a different instructor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's just say you're wandering into the snake pit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd recommend Patel or maybe Mueller.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, man.
It can't be that bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think Roman Colosseum, lions,
people cheering for your death.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I'd have to rearrange my whole schedule.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think
I can really--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your funeral.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Last drop date is the 22nd.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You might want to keep that in mind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks.
- Yeah, have a good semester.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Martin Yip.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does
P.R.C. stand for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People's Republic of China.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh. Seriously?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh yes, always serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotta be kidding me!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White & Wolfe, how can I help you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, please hold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">White & Wolfe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm, I will let 'em know
you called.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, bye-bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Buy as much Tochigi Heavy Industries</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as you can on-margin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've gotten wind of a merger</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the Japanese could care less about insider trading.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna thank me for this one, I guarantee it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on with Marc.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I need you to give me directions.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're kidding, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, somebody stole my GPS</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my phone has decided that
it is spinning propeller time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can't do it. The Nikkei just opened</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there's a massive
sell-off going on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and by the way, I made reservations for us Friday</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at La Rive Gauche.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, you'll take me to La Rive Gauche</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you won't take the time to give me directions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's in it for me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're kidding, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, well, I'm on my way to an ambush interview</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Duck Commander Willie Robertson,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I am going to crash that party</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hold his feet to the fire.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yesterday's discrete web hits were over 32,000,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means I am on pace for
over a million views this month</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">--Own advertisers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my girl!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not just another pretty face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Shelley, I've got something special for you today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think you're gonna like it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh my, chicken!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know when was the last time I had chicken.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be yesterday, for lunch and dinner.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you serious?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that she should
have the same thing every--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think of anything else gonna make her that happy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it okay if I help?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, alright, alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're new here, aren't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, Mom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mina, your daughter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I don't--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see a ring.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's complicated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Professor Radisson and this is Philosophy 150,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Introduction to Philosophical Thought.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If either of those facts is news to you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then now would be your turn to leave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand some of you are here</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to satisfy your Liberal Arts elective requirements.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're looking for an easy grade without much work,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, then now would be your turn to leave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, you've now enrolled at a university.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll be expected to produce
university-level work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pfft, I'm out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's always one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michel Foucault, Bertrand Russel,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ludwig Feuerbach, Bertolt Brecht,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, George Santayana,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Democritus, Denis Diderot, David Hume,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">John Stuart Mill, Albert Camus, Richard Dawkins,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sigmund Freud, Noam Chomsky.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The list goes on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Philosophers, poets, scientists, authors,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">towering intellects, all of them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what do they all have in common?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that would be incorrect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Chomsky are
still very much alive, Mister--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">G-dog Gerard Trigga.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">G-dog.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyone else?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they are,
or were... atheists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Based on the 16th-century
French "atheisme,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the Greek "theos," meaning "God,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and from the prefix "a,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning, as it always
does in Greek, "without."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In short, each of the thinkers I named</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">took the strong position that there is no God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as opposed to the weak position of agnosticism.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Gnostic," from the Greek "gnosos," to know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and again, with the prefix "a" meaning to not know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or more accurately, to doubt the
existence of a supreme being.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This semester, I propose that we refuse</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to waste our limited time together debating the existence</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the big man in the sky, the myth of a benevolent,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all-powerful,
supernatural being.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey!
- How was your flight?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wonderful.
- Wonderful?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like
a 30-hour flight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">36.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great to see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice to see you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dakar to Zurich, Zurich to Frankfurt,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an 8-hour layover,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and direct to Carter International.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ugh, how does that translate as wonderful?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm happy, I'm safe, and now I'm here because God is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all the time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is, of course, a metaphor,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but an illustrative one meaning
not that God has somehow died,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but rather that he never existed in the first place,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">other than in the depths of our forebears' imaginations.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a useful fairy tale in ages gone by,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when his fiery anger was used to explain away plagues</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and crop failures, diseases and disasters,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which we now ascribe to bacteria and viruses,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">chromosomal disorders, and plate tectonics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In short, science and reason have supplanted superstition,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we are all the better for it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with your permission,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would like to bypass this senseless debate all together</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and jump to the conclusion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of which every sophomore is already aware of:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there is no God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All that I require from each of you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that you fill in the papers I've just given you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with 3 little words:
"God is dead,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">along with your signature.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner we reach a unanimous consensus,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which I expect we will,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be spared the tedious duty</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of slogging through dry and dusty arguments,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you will bypass the section of the course</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which students have traditionally received</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">their lowest grades of the semester.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when you finish, please pass your papers to the right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, a lower case "g."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe this one ought to get extra credit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, Mister--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wheaton.
Josh Wheaton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Wheaton,
is something wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't do what you want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a Christian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, don't worry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can still go back to your dorm room</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and sink to your knees</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and pray to your bedside if you'd like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you do in your personal life is your business,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what you do in this class is mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, Mr. Wheaton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Allow me to explain the alternative.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you cannot bring yourself to admit that God is dead</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the purposes of this class,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you will need to defend the antithesis</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that God is not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll need to do it in front of this class</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from the podium.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you fail, as you shall, you will fail this section</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and lose 30% of your final grade right off the bat.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready to accept that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, who would decide whether I won</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or lost the argument?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I would.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my class, my rules.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grading's my prerogative.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No disrespect, but I'm not sure you can be objective.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What would you propose?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what about them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's interesting,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but why would I want to empower them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you've already won them over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I'd have to unconvince them,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">get them to admit they were wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, Mr. Wheaton.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll get 3 sessions,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the last 20 minutes of each of the next 3 classes,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to make your case.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise to keep my interruptions to a minimum.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You may take whatever questions you'd like from the class,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I will not increase your allotted time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, you'll be responsible</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for all the other class assignments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, you know, you could change your mind</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bring in your signed statement at our next class,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we'll go forward as though none of this ever happened.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The rest of us, having dispensed
with primitive superstition,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will turn our focus to the issue of being in reality.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For our next class,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">please have read David Hume's "The Problems of Induction"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Renee Descartes' "Discourse on Method,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to which you may add Bertrand Russell's</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Why I Am Not a Christian"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in preparation
for Mr. Wheaton's lecture</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in thanks for his failure to help us reach</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a unanimous consensus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't want to deny your faith, I get it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the answer's simple:
drop the class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but I'm not sure I can do that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like God wants someone to defend him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be ridiculous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, I just keep thinking</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of that C.S. Lewis line,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Only a real risk can
test the reality of a belief."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you're gonna risk our future over your yearbook quote?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, why am I here?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, earth to Josh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I, Salutatorian of our graduating class,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">here at my
third-choice school?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry for having the next 50 years</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of our life planned out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just who I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, Kara,
it's just--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, I love you, but I absolutely forbid you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go up against this professor in his own classroom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have too much at stake.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The whole thing's rigged to make you look like an idiot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if you want to get into law school,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can't afford to flunk this class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even a "C" could be disastrous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why you wear those heels.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's wrong with 'em?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're too tall.
You're taller than me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're man enough to handle it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just saying, I don't want
to be the short guy at the prom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Robertson!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, or should I call you Willie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call me Willie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy Ryan,
I blog "The New Left."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you a few questions?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure, fire away.
This is my wife--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Korie, I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm actually surprised to see you here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you'd be home, barefoot and pregnant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't been barefoot and
pregnant in a really long time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do kinda miss those days, huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you want to start
again? We can try.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've made a fortune selling devices</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that are designed to lure water fowl to their deaths.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I guess when you say "you,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're referring to the whole group of my family,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which would be "y'all."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can just
change it to "y'all."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'd be an easier expression,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that way it'll get everybody in there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, y'all have made a fortune, isn't that right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're doing alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can certainly buy bigger tires on our trucks</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and four-wheelers
to get out in the mud with,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so life is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What makes you think you have the moral right</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to go around maiming and killing innocent animals?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, look, let's just get one thing straight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ain't maiming nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever I see and I aim at, I shoot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I shoot it, I kill it and then I eat it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you do kill those ducks?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I do. What am I gonna do,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">cook 'em while they're still moving around?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That would be cruel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That'd be bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this isn't an act? You're
actually proud of what you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I am. Why would I
do it if I'm not proud of it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you go along with everything he says?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been married for 20 years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't go along with everything he says,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but on the things that matter, yeah,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I agree wholeheartedly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what do you say to people
who are offended by your show,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not just because of the hunting,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but because you openly pray to Jesus in every episode?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, we're not trying to offend anybody, alright?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they don't want to watch the
show, they can turn the channel.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As far as my praying to Jesus,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my life and my whole eternity belongs to God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All this stuff is temporary:
the money, fame, success.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Temporary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even life is temporary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, that's eternal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus said this:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whoever acknowledges me before men,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he will acknowledge before the Father in heaven.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Whoever disowns me,
I'll disown him to the Father."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, those words are written in red so they're important.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.
That's what we're going with.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pretty simple, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for your time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, let's go do some acknowledging.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're welcome to join us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No thanks, I'm good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're good?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who was that lady?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're beautiful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wish you didn't have to do that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for my father.
He's very traditional.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who were you talking to?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ayisha, I know it's hard living in their world</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and being apart from it,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a world you can see but can't touch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know they seem happy,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but know that when you look around at all those people,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there is no one who worships God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not the way he deserves and demands to be worshipped.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We must never forget who and what we are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the most important thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Baba.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I only insist on this because I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that, don't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That I love you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course, Baba.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You waiting for someone?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you could say that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like he's out at the moment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe that's why he sent me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the ones and zeros</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The beautiful incomplete</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the future heroes</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A colorful symphony</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the ones</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could drop the class, run away,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">pretend like it never happened,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is what my girlfriend wants.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could sign the paper saying something I don't believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or I commit academic suicide in front of a live audience</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by trying to prove that God exists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How many people in that class?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eighty maybe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how many of them do you think</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would ever step foot in here,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or any other church for that matter?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, none probably.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, your acceptance of this challenge,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you decide to accept it,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">may be the only meaningful exposure to God and Jesus</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they'll ever have.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I suppose so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check out
Matthew 10:32-33.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What, that's it?
That's all?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a Scriptural citation?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're still undecided after that one,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at Luke 12:48.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It can't be that simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure it can.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're here because that still small voice inside you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">isn't happy with the choices
everyone else wants you to make.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Personally, I think it's the Holy Spirit talking to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how he interacts with us if we allow him to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All you have to do is decide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whether or not you're willing to listen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not easy, but it's simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"So everyone who acknowledges me before men,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I also will acknowledge before
my Father who is in heaven,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"but whoever denies me before men,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I also will deny before
my Father who is in heaven."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Everyone to whom much was given,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"of him much will be required,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and from him to whom they entrusted much,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they will demand the more."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I'm late.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to move a ton of stuff around just to get here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, go and have a seat
Ms. Ryan.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, excuse me a second.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've gotten your results back
from your test the last week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, as I was saying--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.
I have got to take this call.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your results came back positive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have cancer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have time for cancer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm too busy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, it's already grown into the surrounding tissue.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your lymph nodes are involved
and your blood markers indicate</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">evidence of distant metastasis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I've already scheduled you for an MRI.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to determine the extent of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you're very important</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the world can't get along without you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's my job to let you know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it may be preparing to do exactly that,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it certainly will unless
you begin immediate treatment.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you understand?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey babe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Babe, where have you been?
Did you turn your phone off?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More like I forgot to turn my phone on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what day it is?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thursday?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The 13th?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy anniversary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 years ago, your youth group collided with mine.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remembered.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mm-hmm, and
we're gonna celebrate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You remember how we met?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Newsboys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're gonna be in town next Friday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are amazing, which is why I love you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know I came off probably way too strong yesterday.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I just--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get concerned when outside
things start coming between us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get that, can't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sure.
- Forgive me?
- Always.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just need--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that can't all be Statistics.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, please tell me you haven't been spending</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all your time on that philosophy thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not all of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, most of it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, that's not funny.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it's really not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, this is something I want to do, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand how it comes between us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, everything you do is about us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we're a team.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we're what, 6 years going on forever, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means your grades, your whole future,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a part of that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't see how this is contributing to our future.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, neither do my parents</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or anyone else in my life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What should that tell you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if every single person that loves you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is saying the exact same thing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, I'm letting you know now for your own good,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this experiment is over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need to prioritize and decide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's the most important person in your life,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">me or Professor Radisson?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if it's God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God wants you with me, so it's the same answer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Return the books to the library, sign the stupid paper,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and move on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A year from now, we'll look back on this and laugh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not in high school anymore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The decisions you make now can have real consequences.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh, this is serious.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I'm making a 12-hour drive to Florida</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to do things that seemed corny when I was 12.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, I promised my mother a picture of me in mouse ears</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">standing in front of the fairy tale castle.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mouse ears are for me, picture is for her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To you, it's old-hat, but to me,
it's a lifelong dream come true.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you not understand that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then we'll go for the undersea submarine ride.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, I think they closed that ride like 20 years ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then we'll ride the world's biggest roller coaster.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">16th biggest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In my mind, when I'm screaming as we descend,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it will be the world's biggest</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'll be glad that it's not taller than it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't sound good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe the battery--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or the starter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Either way, we're not going anywhere right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll call and arrange for a rental car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But how will we get to the rental car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll deliver it to us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you serious?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, absolutely.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They'll deliver us the car we are to drive?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amazing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there are some flat-earthers out there</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who still consider the existence of a supreme deity</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be either necessary,
or self-evident, or both.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And with that, as previously announced,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will be turning the podium
over to Mr. Wheaton,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who will be presenting his case in favor</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a supreme celestial dictator,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">otherwise known as God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Wheaton,
are you ready?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Podium is yours.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Atheists say that no one can prove the existence of God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and well, they're right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I say no one can disprove that God exists.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the only way to debate this issue</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to look at the available evidence,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that's what we're going to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to put God on trial,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Professor Radisson as the prosecutor,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and me as the defense attorney,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you as the jury.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Most cosmologists now agree</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the universe began
some 13.7 billion years ago</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in an event known as the Big Bang.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, let's look at theoretical physicist</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg's description</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of what the Big Bang would have looked like.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And since he's an atheist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we can be sure
there isn't any believer-bias</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in his description.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the beginning, there was an explosion,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and in 3 minutes, 98% of the matter there is</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or ever will be, was produced.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had a universe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For 2,500 years,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">most scientists agreed with Aristotle on the idea</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a steady-state universe,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the universe has always existed</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with no beginning and no end, but the Bible disagreed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the 1920s, Belgian astronomer
Georges Lematre, a theist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who was actually also--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's a theist?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A theist is someone who believes in the existence of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said that the entire universe jumping into existence</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of nothingness,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in an unimaginably intense flash of light</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is how he would expect the universe to respond</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if God were to actually utter
the command in Genesis 1:3,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Let there be light."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, the origin of the universe unfolded</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">exactly how one would expect after reading Genesis,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and for 2,500 years,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Bible had it right and science had it wrong.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the earliest you can get here is 5?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we'll be waiting.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, it has air conditioning, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, looks like we won't get there 'til late tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, I think you're gonna
miss an entire day at the park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, David.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure we can make good use of our time here today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can meet the choir director,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">talk about song choices for the upcoming concert.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we could meet the women's club</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about the details for the next craft bazaar.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lots of important stuff.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And since you're not leaving,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'll have time to meet Mina for lunch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, I can meet Mina for lunch.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like you need this vacation more than I do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I just need to do some meaningful work</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that I can have something to take a vacation from.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, some of the most important work that we do</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">may seem meaningless to us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This coming from the missionary</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who literally is in the trenches,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">winning hearts for the Lord on a daily basis.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, God has you exactly where he wants you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He who is faithful in a very little thing</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is also faithful in much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God knows you're doing the work.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's all part of his grand design.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of which points to a God that created it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, in the real world, we never see things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">jumping into existence out of nothingness,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but atheists want to make one
small exception to this rule,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">namely, the universe and everything in it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in his book, "The God Delusion,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard Dawkins says</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that, "If you tell me God created the universe,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I have the right
to ask you who created God."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dawkins' question only makes sense</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in terms of a God who has been created.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't make sense in terms of an uncreated God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which is the kind of God that Christians believe in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even leaving God out of the equation,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I then have a right to turn
Mr. Dawkins's own question</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">back around on him and ask,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If the universe created you,
then who created the universe?."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, both the theist and the atheist are both burdened</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with answering this same question</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of how did things start.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I'm hoping you'll pick up from all this</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that you don't have to commit intellectual suicide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to believe in a Creator behind the creation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to the extent that you don't allow for God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd be pretty hard-pressed
to find an incredible</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">alternative explanation for how things came to be.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I imagine you're quite pleased with yourself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see you've carefully avoided
the fact that Stephen Hawking,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the world's most famous scientist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and who is not a theist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has recently come out in favor
of a self-designing universe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't avoided it,
I just didn't--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just didn't know about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, well let's see what Professor Hawking,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lucasian Professor of physics at Cambridge,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who occupies a teaching chair
once held by Sir Isaac Newton,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has to say about the origin of the universe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I quote, "Because there's a law such as gravity,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"the universe can and will create itself from nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Spontaneous creation is the reason</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"there is something instead of nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"It's why the universe exists, why we exist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"lt is not necessary to invoke God</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to set the universe
in motion."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">End of quote.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you may have never come across his comment,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but his point remains.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you answer?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I prick the balloon of your entire argument</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a single pin, and you don't know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean, I'd like to tell
you I have the perfect answer,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it doesn't shake my underlying faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so the greatest scientific mind in all of history says</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that God is not necessary, but
a first-semester freshman says,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Oh, yes he is."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, you know, that's gonna be a really tough choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I look forward to next week's lecture.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Class is dismissed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think you're smarter than me, Wheaton?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think there's any argument you can make</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I won't have an answer for?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I never said I was smarter.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's the first intelligent thing you've said.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I want to make this clear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In that classroom, there is a god,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and yep, I'm him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm also a jealous god, so do not try to humiliate me</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in front of my students.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I also checked up on your declared major.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pre-law?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is pre-law?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't award degrees in that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't bother answering, but know this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you truly feel a need to continue with the charade,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I will make it my personal mission to destroy any hope</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a law degree in your future.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You did it, didn't you?
- What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm talking about.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You went and did your argument, didn't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you trying to prove?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not even sure there are words to describe</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what I'm feeling right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry Josh, but it's over between us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?
It's just--it's over?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's over, Josh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're going to do something this stupid and selfish</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after I already told you
what would happen--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but that's sort of the point, isn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is something that's important to me, right,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but since it's not important to you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you made it a make-it-
or-break-it-thing for us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't ask me, you told me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It wasn't a decision that we made,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it was a decision that you made for the both of us.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, somebody had to.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it? "Okay"?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not what I want.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honestly, I'm still hoping you'll change your mind, right,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I have to do this thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like it's something that God wants me to do.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't just turn away from it, especially not now,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">now that I've started.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother was so right about you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just wish I'd had the sense to listen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh picture it, a little girl,
just a beautiful 8-year-old</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trying to live through this life in a crazy world</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Fahid.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She finds herself as a teen
and her life in ruins--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Showed that girl she had meaning and a purpose to life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe avoid that downward slide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you tell her the truth or let her live in a lie?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It all just seems to change</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you see it
as a life to save--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1 Corinthians says you're saved,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">according to the Scriptures.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you believe this in your heart,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you accept this by faith,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you see, God will forgive you, he'll cleanse you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he'll set you free.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me that!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must never tell Baba.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swear to me you will never say anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swear it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bottle of Cristal, my table.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Mr. Shelley.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have some news.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me too.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, but me first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just been named partner.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I have cancer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you hear what I just said?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have cancer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This couldn't wait until tomorrow?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you say that to me?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you loved me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do, but you're changing our agreement,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're breaking our deal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You make it sound like a contract negotiation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what did you think this was?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought it was love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grow up, Amy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love is the most overused word in the English language.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's what we say when we want something,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we need something,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're as guilty of it as anybody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had fun.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were my hot, young girlfriend with the chic job.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was your upwardly mobile,
charming, successful boyfriend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we were together because we each got something</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">out of the relationship that we wanted,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it was good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was--
actually, it was great.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But now it's over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did I not see this in you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because you saw what you wanted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You understand that I might die?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sorry about that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you're in my philosophy class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Martin, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Correct,
and you're Mr. Josh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's me,
Mr. Josh.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is that on our reading list?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I ask you a question?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you doing what you are doing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone else thinks I'm crazy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My girlfriend--
ex-girlfriend left me over it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My parents don't want me to risk it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the end of it all,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna have to work like a dog</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the rest of the semester</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to catch up on my other classes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have described your difficulties,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but you haven't answered my question of why.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just--I think of Jesus
as my friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you think Jesus is God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and the Son of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to disappoint him,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even if everyone thinks I should.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, to me, he's not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's alive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want anyone to get talked out of believing in him</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just because some professor thinks they should.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See you around, Martin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hiya, Tom Blanchard, Metro City Auto.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here's your keys.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Satisfaction is guaranteed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I need to sign something?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Absolutely.
I'm giving you a car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sign here,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then one more right there, and one more there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you could just initial there, there, and there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call us when you're back.
You have it for the weekend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll come pick you up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're kidding.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?
Did you break it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check and see if it's still in gear.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's in park.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't understand.
It worked 5 minutes ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, well, now it's not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How soon can you get us another car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, not tonight.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's already after 5:30.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone's gone home</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm already kind of late for an audition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An audition?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the gang and I are doing "Death of a Salesman"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's kind of a dinner theatre thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to satisfaction guaranteed?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's alright, David.
We can leave tomorrow.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to make this drive and miss half the day?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps it's gonna rain anyway.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forecast for tomorrow
is 82 and sunny at 9 a.m.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you don't make any sense.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes you make too much.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just remember, God is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all the time?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you sign this saying you reject the car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're on with Marc.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's me, dork, your sister.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, and this is about?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You really should go see Mom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's not doing well.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She hasn't been doing well for years.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why they call it dementia.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still, you should go see her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Claire said you haven't been there in awhile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like it matters?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Besides, I just bought her a new TV.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'll make you a deal.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You go and you ask her what 3 + 3 equals.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If she gives you the right answer, I'll visit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not fair.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life's not fair. I gotta go.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say hi to Amy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's over.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What'd you do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unresolved personal issues.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's got some stuff she's gotta work through.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to hear that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's the way it goes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, ready to get this started?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously, you have got to get a life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, tell me about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey honey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry, the door was open.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just let myself in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi.
- Hi.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh hey, did you pick up the bottle of wine I wanted?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I left it in the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the car.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't worry about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a lot on your plate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you know, just--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">thank you for helping set up our dinner party.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, unless I'm wrong,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all the guests are from the philosophy department?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not true.
Vivian's a sociologist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're proving my point.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I can't help it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, my intellectual rigor falls to pieces</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the instant I get around you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could have fooled me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The first time I walked into your classroom,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you were all blood and thunder.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was a performance, staged largely for your benefit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the mean time, I kept trying to keep my eyes off you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and hoping that there was a brain inside that pretty head.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, because if there wasn't, then, you know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's no way I could have made myself go out with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, as it was, I waited until you aced the midterm.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was an A-minus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close enough.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, where is she?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Huh?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That carefree,
free-spirited girl</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who forced me to almost risk my career by dating her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the one who quoted Emily Dickinson, and Shelley,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Spongebob Squarepants
with equal self-confidence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what ever happened to the old Mina?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause I miss her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She has got a mom who's failing,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she's sensing time is passing by,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she's starting to wonder if she's unequally yoked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, you've been reading again, haven't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reading, listening, thinking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can hardly call this thinking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a matter of fact, it's the opposite of thinking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I'm a Christian.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew that when you first started seeing me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, and you know that I'm not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I know there's a lot of things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you don't want to talk about,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so we don't talk about them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, except the not talking is starting to get louder</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and louder, and soon it will be deafening,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I don't know if I can put up with that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know.
- Do you?
- Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because we need to be clear on this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only room in this relationship for two,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means I don't get a mistress</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you don't get to drag a
2,000-year-old dead carpenter</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">turned itinerant rabbi into our lives.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm gonna go freshen up.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this the same car?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no sir.
No, sir.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Same model, different color.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other one was a cabernet.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is more of a merlot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, lying's not good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lying to an ordained minister
is flat-out bad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know that, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir, I assure you this is a different automobile.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, try it out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd your audition go?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, pretty good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm up for the role of Biff,
so--thanks for asking.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys going somewhere?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's it look for you with the department chair position?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm up for review
mid-semester.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dean Powell assures me it's a slam dunk.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, congratulations Jeffrey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anything else on your plate?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not really.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feel like sharing?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've got this student in my
introductory class this semester</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who's--well,
he's taken a challenge</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to prove the existence of God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In your classroom?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- Silly boy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Freshman?
- Oh yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doesn't seem quite fair to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how's that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's inexperienced in front of a room,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're expecting him to compete with you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in your own field of expertise.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Mina. This is fun for me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't help it if a boy wants to make a fool of himself</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and commit academic suicide.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I tried to stop him.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave him an out, but no, no, no,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he wants to prove that God isn't dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I know I am in the minority here,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I actually believe in God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, yes, well, she is--
she's a work in progress.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, darling, I think it's best we just change the subject.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm just saying--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mina, I've asked politely, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The coq au vin is almost done.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excellent.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the dining room.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing like a nice merlot to take the edge off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cheers, everyone.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mina, this wine is awful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been cooked.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It tastes like it was sunning in a moldy basement.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Talk about your
"Grapes of Wrath."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bought it before I went shopping the other day.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I locked it in the trunk</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and when I got home I forgot about it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I think this dinner serves as a valuable lesson.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As Socrates put it over 2,000 years ago,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Gnothi seauton."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like it's Greek to her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it's "Know thyself," darling, know thyself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which I suggest means knowing your own limitations.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, if you'll all excuse me,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's time for the help to depart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No pacemaker?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No other piercings, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it sounds crazy, but I have to ask.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If there's any ferrous metal anywhere inside your body,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the magnetic field will put it out, and forcibly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In our last class, I was asked a question</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I couldn't answer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As Professor Radisson pointed out,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stephen Hawking is an atheist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He also wrote a book called "The Grand Design"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in which he says the following:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Because there is a law such as gravity,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the universe can and will
create itself from nothing."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to be honest, I didn't know how to refute that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, after all, Hawking is clearly a genius.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, Professor John Lennox,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who teaches mathematics and philosophy</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has demonstrated that there are not one, even two,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but three errors of logic contained</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in that one simple sentence,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it all boils down to circular reasoning.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hawking is basically saying that the universe exists</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because the universe needed to exist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and because the universe needed to exist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it therefore created itself.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I say to you that I can prove</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Spam is the best-tasting
food that's ever existed</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because in all of history, no food has ever tasted better,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you'd probably look at me strange</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and say I haven't proven anything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'd be right,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all I've done is restate my original claim.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But when Hawking claims that the universe created itself</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because it needed to create itself,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then offers that as an explanation</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as to how and why it was created,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we don't immediately recognize
that he's doing the same thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he is, prompting Lennox to further comment,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Nonsense remains nonsense,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"even when spoken by famous scientists</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"even though the general public</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">assumes they are
statements of science."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the height of hubris.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you telling me that you, a freshman,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are saying that Stephen Hawking is wrong?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, what I'm saying is that John Lennox,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a professor of mathematics and philosophy,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has found Professor Hawking's reasoning to be faulty,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I agree with his logic.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you can't bear to disagree</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with Hawking's thinking,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then I suggest that you turn to page five of his book,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he insists philosophy is dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you're so sure</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of Professor Hawking's infallibility,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and philosophy really is dead,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then well, there's really no need for this class.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I'm a convenience to him,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except for when my faith comes up,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then he becomes verbally abusive.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm guessing he's bright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brilliant.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handsome.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And his attention makes you feel special,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">gives you a sense of completeness.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you been reading my diary?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Psychologists call it the Cinderella complex.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not my name for it, so don't get upset with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys are capable of the same thing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just they don't have a name for it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in essence, you're looking for his approval</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to give you
a sense of self-worth</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">instead of generating it internally.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't most people do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, a lot of people do, sure.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, using romance
to shore up self-image</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is an unstable foundation.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you believe God's capable
of error, bias, or bad judgment?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if he's incapable of mistakes,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he made you in his likeness and image,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it follows that he cares about you, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the point where God's only Son</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would willingly be crucified again for you, just you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if that's what was necessary.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if he loves you that much,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who cares what your boyfriend thinks?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To the wrong person, you'll never have any worth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But to the right person, you'll mean everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last 150 years, Darwinists have been saying</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that God is unnecessary to explain man's existence</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and that evolution replaces God,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but evolution only tells you what happens</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">once you have life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where did that something that's alive come from?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Darwin never really addressed it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He assumed maybe some lightning hit a stagnant pool</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">full of the right kind of chemicals</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and bingo, a living something.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's just not that simple.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Darwin claimed that the
ancestry of all living things</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">came from that one single, simple organism</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which reproduced and was slowly modified over time</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into the complex life forms we view today.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Which is why, after contemplating his own theory,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Darwin uttered his famous statement,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Natura non facit saltum,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning,
"Nature does not jump."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as noted author Lee Strobel pointed out,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that if you can picture
the entire 3.8 billion years</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that scientists say life has been around</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as one 24-hour day,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the space of just about 90 seconds,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">most major animal groups suddenly appear</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the forms in which they currently hold.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not slowly and steadily as Darein predicted,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but in evolutionary terms, almost instantly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, "nature does not jump" becomes</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"nature makes
a giant leap."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, how do theists explain this sudden outburst</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of new biological information?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"And God said, 'Let the water teem with living creatures</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'and let birds fly above the earth</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">across the expanse
of the sky.'</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"So God created the great creatures of the sea</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and every living and moving thing</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"with which the water teems,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"according to its kind.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And God saw that it
was good," Genesis 1:20.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, creation happened</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because God said it should happen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even what looks, to our eyes,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be a blind, unguided process</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">could really be divinely controlled from start to finish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Isn't there anyone you'd like
to have here with you for this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, there's nobody.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lies, lies, and more lies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's easy to dismiss what you don't understand</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or what you don't want to understand.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There it is, the default setting of the Bible-thumper.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If only you would open the Scripture and read,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you would understand."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So says the brave young freshman.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"For thou art wise, and with thou, all wisdom shall die,"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Job 12, verse 2.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What else does Job tell us?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"For man who is born of woman is few of days,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and full of trouble.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He comes forth like a shadow and does not continue.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"So man lies down, and does not rise</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'til the heavens
are no more."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, at least he got that part right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened to you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When a 12-year-old watches
his mother dying of cancer,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's only natural to beg God for her life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He'll promise anything</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to his make-believe
grandfather in the sky,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">including to love and worship him forever,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if only he will spare her.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the answer is no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell that to me the day you lose someone you love.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She died believing a lie.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She died believing that someone out there loved her</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">even while he was strangling her to death.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A God who would allow that is not worth believing in.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is why, Wheaton, you will find</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the most committed atheists were once Christians,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we took the blinders off.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We saw the world for what it truly is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, Shakespeare had it right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life is really a tale told by an idiot,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ayisha!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"He's the one god
who has not begotten."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I command you to say it!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Baba.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus is my Lord and Savior and
he died to save me from my sins.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Carry on, carry on</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I know is you, my God, are real</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No matter how I feel, you've never let me go</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what I know is there will never be a day</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You aren't just a breath away</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And through it all I've gotta hold to what I know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gonna hold to what I know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry for the delay in posting my interview.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a rough week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When I finally caught up to--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">New post.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have cancer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amy is going to die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeffrey, I need to talk to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know how I feel about that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On campus, I'm Professor Radisson, okay?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, then he claims that Dawkins
is the one who was in error,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as if Dawkins thought--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeffrey, I'm leaving you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you saying?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm leaving you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't do that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't accept it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said I don't accept that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I won't allow it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, I heard you, but it's not your choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good bye, Jeffrey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long has she been hiding her faith?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About a year.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't even imagine what she must be feeling.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You asked to be in the trenches, David.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What have I done, Pastor Dave?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've lost everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if I made a mistake?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ayisha, you've displayed an amazing amount of courage</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by standing up for your faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God knows the risks you've taken and he will honor that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think I can do this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're here for you, Ayisha.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you--have you read of the Apostle Paul?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said, "I know what it is to have little,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and I know what it is to have plenty.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"ln any and all circumstances,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I have learned the secret
of being well-fed</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and of being hungry,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"of having plenty and of being in need.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can do all things--"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Through Christ
who strengthens me."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not alone, Ayisha.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a mistake with you,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Letting you speak in front of my classroom</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and spew your propaganda.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But today, we're gonna change things up a bit.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Evil.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, it's been said that evil
is atheism's most potent weapon</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">against the Christian faith, and it is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After all, the very existence of evil begs the question,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If God is all-good
and God is all-powerful,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">why does he allow
evil to exist?."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer at its core is
remarkably simple: free will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God allows evil to exist because of free will.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the Christian standpoint,
God tolerates evil in this world</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on a temporary basis so that one day,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">those who choose to love him freely</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will dwell with him in heaven,
free from the influence of evil,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but with their free will in tact.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In other words, God's intention concerning evil</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is to one day destroy it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how convenient.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"One day, I will get rid of all the evil in the world.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"But until then, you just have to deal with all the wars,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and Holocausts, tsunamis, poverty, starvation, and AIDS.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have a nice life."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Next, he'll be lecturing us on moral absolutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why not?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor Radisson, who's clearly an atheist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">doesn't believe in moral absolutes,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but his core syllabus says he plans to give us an exam</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">during finals week.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm betting that if I manage to get an "A"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">on the exam by cheating,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he'll suddenly start sounding like a Christian,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">insisting it's wrong to cheat,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that I should have known that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet, what basis does he have?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If my actions are calculated to help me succeed,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then why shouldn't I perform them?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Christians, the fixed point of morality,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what constitutes right and wrong,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is a straight line that leads directly back to God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, so you're saying that we need a God to be moral,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that a moral atheist is an impossibility.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, but with no God, there's no real reason to be moral.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's not even a standard</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of what moral behavior is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For Christians,
lying, cheating, stealing--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in my example, stealing
a grade I didn't earn--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">are forbidden.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a form of theft.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if God does not exist,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as Dostoyevsky famously pointed out,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"If God does not exist,
then everything is permissible."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And not only permissible, but pointless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Professor Radisson is right, then all of this,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all of our struggle, our debate,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whatever we decide here is meaningless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, our lives and ultimately our deaths</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">have no more consequence than that of a goldfish.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is ridiculous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, after all your talk,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're saying that it all comes down to choice:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">believe or don't believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right, that's all there is.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all there's ever been.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only difference between your position and my position</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is that you take away their choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You demand that they choose the
box marked, "I don't believe."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, because I want to free them.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because religion
is like a--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it's like a mind virus that parents have passed on</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">down to their children,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Christianity is the worst virus of all.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It slowly creeps into our lives</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we're weak or sick or helpless.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, religion is like a disease?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes, it infects everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the enemy of reason.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Reason?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Professor, you left reason a long time ago.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're teaching here isn't philosophy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not even atheism anymore.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you're teaching is antitheism.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not enough that you don't believe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need all of us to not believe with you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you admit the truth?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just want to ensnare them
in your primitive superstition.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I want is for them to make their own choice.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what God wants.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea how much I'm gonna enjoy failing you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but who are you really looking to fail, Professor?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me or God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you hate God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not even a question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, why do you hate God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is ridiculous.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you hate God?
Answer the question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've seen the science and the arguments.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Science supports his existence.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know the truth.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, why do you hate him?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?.!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a very simple question, Professor.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you hate God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because he took everything away from me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I hate God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I have for him is hate.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you hate someone if they don't exist?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've proven nothing.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe not.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They get to choose.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is God dead?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead.
God's not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead. God's not dead. God's not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead. God's not dead. God's not dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Josh. Josh!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your decision to prove God is not dead</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has affected me greatly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, and it has changed everything.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've decided to follow Jesus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's great, Martin.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you know what?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've gotta check this out.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Come on.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I have to bring my suitcase?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not bringing it would show a lack of faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh merciful Father, please allow this car to start.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why, do you have a better "Lord, please make my car run"</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">blessing that you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So then, let's give it a try.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put our bags in the trunk first.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">David, we spend our entire lives talking about faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm asking you to show faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Unbelievable.
- No. Faith.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- God is good.
- All the time.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And all the time?
- God is good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't even know what I'm doing here.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, it's not like you even know who I am.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You prayed and believed</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your whole life,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">never done anything wrong,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and here you are.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the nicest person I know, I am the meanest.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have dementia, my life is perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Explain that to me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes the devil allows people</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to live a life free of trouble</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause he doesn't want them turning to God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your sin is like a jail cell,
except it's all nice and comfy,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there doesn't seem to be any need to leave.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The door's wide open</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'til one day, time runs out,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the cell door slams shut</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and suddenly...
it's too late.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who did you say you were?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe this.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The car actually starts</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and now we're being
done-in by believers.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's beautiful.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, no more words of wisdom.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm just happy to see</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">all these people going to sing about Jesus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello, gentlemen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I help you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Amy Ryan.
I write "The New Left."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Michael Tait.
How are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did we schedule this?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I actually find that the
best interviews are unscripted.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, in a few minutes, you guys are gonna go out there</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're gonna sing about God and Jesus</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as if they're as real as you and me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you do that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to us, they are as real.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a matter of fact, even more so.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we exist in the here and now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They've existed forever.
Think about that.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know, in the beginning was the Word.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Word was with God and the Word was God.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I see.
So when you're pressed,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you quote a bunch of ancient scribblings and say,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Don't worry,
it's all in there."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, they may be ancient, but they're not scribblings.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, we believe God gave us an instruction manual,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's where we draw our strength</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it's where we find our hope.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, where do you find your hope?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Amy, you're not here to trash us, are you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that's what you might have done,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I think you're here kinda wondering,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">kinda hoping that this stuff is for real, aren't you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know that?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just felt that that's what God was saying,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he just wanted you to know it.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's--I can't--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, and he's just the drummer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we never really did what we're told</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we'll say we were dumb and all alone</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're still chasing the sun</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll say we were young and full of hope</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we never really did what we're told</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we'll say we were dumb and all alone</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we're still chasing the sun</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One day, we'll fade
but we'll never forget--</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"My dearest son,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"words cannot express the love I have for you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"or the sorrow in my heart</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"knowing that I will never be able to see you grow up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and fulfill God's plan for your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"My heart is broken at the thought of leaving you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I know God is in control.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"His ways are higher than our ways</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Live life to the fullest and
remain in the joy of the Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You will forever be in my heart.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.
Mom."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, it's Mina.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry I missed your call.
Leave a message.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mina, it's Jeffrey.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please call me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey guys, we're a-go for the show.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey Steve, give us a minute, buddy.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is kinda important.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks guys.
- Thanks.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we pray for you real quick?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dear God, we don't know your plan for Amy, Lord,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but we're asking you would save her tonight, Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Change her, cleanse her, give her a fresh start, Lord.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let her know that she's loved, and more importantly,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that she is loved by you, the Master of the universe.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give her strength for the journey ahead, Lord,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and let her know in her heart, God, speak to her,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're gonna be with her every step of the way.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We pray this, Jesus, in your holy name.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amen.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey guys, we gotta roll.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cool, you gonna be okay, Amy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You good?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for the King</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The King is coming</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Empty hearts are filling up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wicked ways are coming undone</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every eye is looking out for you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">City lights are burning out</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Freedom's song is ringing loud</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead men waking up to the sound of you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And all our hearts can sing</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All our hearts can sing</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for the King</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The King is coming</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make a way for the King</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's perfect.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So much for sunny and clear skies.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call an ambulance!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call an ambulance!</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His ribs are crushed.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His lungs are filling with blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He doesn't have long.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you sure?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't move.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't die.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not ready.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know Jesus?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm an atheist.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe it's God's mercy that brought me here right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dying.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can you call that mercy?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that car could have killed you instantly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm sure right now you probably wish that it did,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm here to tell you that it's a gift</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause the God that you don't believe in</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has given you another chance,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">another chance to change your final answer.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to die, but I'm so scared.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If it's any consolation, so was Jesus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was so scared, he sweat blood.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked the Father if it could be removed from him,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the answer was no.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He says no a lot.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He gives us the answers we'd ask for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if we knew what he knows.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"'For as the heavens are higher than the earth,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"so are my ways higher than your ways,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and my thoughts are higher than
your thoughts, ' says the Lord."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, the question is--
stay with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you willing to put your faith in Jesus Christ?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you willing to take that chance?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God is willing to forgive you of your sins, all of them,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you accept his Son and ask him into your life.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all you have to do is just accept his Son.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Accept his love and receive his forgiveness right now.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you accept him as Lord and Savior?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I accept.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's alright.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In a few minutes, you're gonna
know more about God than I do,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or anybody else here does.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, it's okay.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you check out the screens behind me,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we have a very special message from a very good friend.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm Willie Robertson,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">speaking on behalf of the Robertson family.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and the gang wanted to let you know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've heard in the news</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there's been a bit of
a squabble down there on campus.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One of your professors insisted that God is dead.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm happy to announce
that the reports of God's death</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">were greatly exaggerated.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, let me ask you a question.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you got your cell phones on you?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alright, now while this next song is playing,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want everyone to go to their contacts</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and click on everybody you know</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and text them three simple words:</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"God's not dead."</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there's 10,000 of you out there,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and everyone knows about 100 people.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a million messages right there.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A million times we're gonna tell Jesus that we love him</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the next 3 minutes.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for the young man who took up the gauntlet</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to defend God's honor, and you know who you are,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can only imagine the smile you put on God's face.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one goes out to you.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was you, wasn't it?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The one who defended God?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I heard you talking in the cafeteria.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only a real risk tests the quality of a belief, right?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let love explode and bring the dead to life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A love so bold to see a revolution somehow</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let love explode and bring the dead to life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A love so bold to see a revolution somehow</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm lost in your freedom</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this world I'll overcome</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let hope arise and make the darkness hide</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My faith is dead</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need a resurrection somehow</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I'm lost in your freedom</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this world I'll overcome</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's roaring, he's roaring</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let heaven roar and fire fall</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come shake the ground with the sound of revival</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let Heaven roar and fire fall</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come shake the ground with the sound of revival</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened here tonight is a cause for celebration.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pain, yes, for just a few moments, but now,</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">think about the joy in heaven.</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God's not dead, he's surely alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Roaring like a lion</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our God is alive</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a story of your life, a movie starring you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the next scene have for you to do?</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Leave the dishes in the sink, leave your fear there too</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live the story you would write for you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, hey, hey, wake your heart</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And break, break, break apart</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The walls that keep you from being you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And walk, walk towards the light</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And don't stop 'til you live your life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like someone died for you</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the time to try</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just step out, your life is waiting</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just step out, your life is waiting</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can find a million words to build a wall of fear</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Safe behind that wall, imprisoned here</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that someday step today to who you're meant to be</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And turn your dreams to plans so you can breathe</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say, hey, hey, wake your heart</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And break, break, break apart</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The walls that keep you from being you</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just step out, your life is waiting</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ask anyone whose time is up</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What they'd give for what you've got</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And how they'd live your life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Live like your life's worth dying for</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just walked out that prison door</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you'll know how to live your life</font>
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the time to try</font>
