38 Degrees. 38 degrees.
I checked
the temperature yesterday.
It was 38 f*****g degrees.
I understand that Grandpa
is old and feels colder but
Who burns a bonfire at 2 in the afternoon?
With all due respect, are you blind?
The sun is shining on you!
And, fine, if you want to
burn a bonfire then do it!
But if you don't find wood, will
you burn somebody's furniture?
You know what Laxmi
aunty was saying?
I loved that cupboard Mikesh!
Are you even listening Mikesh?
Mikesh?
Yeah? Sorry, I caught a
wink due to the darkness.
You were saying something?
I am blindfolded because you were going to
give me a surprise. Why are you blindfolded?
I was getting it one free on
one, would I have wasted it?
And, listen, Tanu
Where is your face?
Why are you crying so much Tanu?
You know what this is? You are getting
mood swings due to your hormonal changes.
Please don't cry. Grandpa keeps
behaving silly, now and again.
No! He does it deliberately.
Because of him, my aunt and your
mother aren't talking since a month.
Now when will we get married?
And he can't stand anyone's happiness.
Laxmi aunty was saying that she has
left the papads to dry on the roof.
She had made them with
such great difficulty.
And Grandpa roasted the in
the bonfire and are them.
Why would you eat somebody else's papad?
They are made with so much difficulty.
Tanu? Tanu. Come on!
Who get's so sentimental about the
neighbour's papads? Just relax.
Just calm down.
Oh, brother Mikesh
What happened?
I winked at you and you totally missed out on that.
Have we reached?
As soon as we reached the location
The map pointer stopped exactly
on the dot, brother Mikesh.
Look at coincidences
the almighty creates!
Purshotam have you brought
us to the location
that I fed in the phone?
Please check once again.
I shall check right now.
Wow, Shabnam! Very well done. You
have brought us to the right place.
We have reached, brother.
Thank you very much Sir.
Thanks for all the help.
This is our job.
Just sign below here. By the
time you are done clicking the
photographs, your marriage
certificate will be issued.
Sign?
Do you have a pen?
-I don't have a pen.
Please take it.
And once you are done
signing, keep it with you.
A wedding gift from my end.
No, sir, how can we? -Please keep it.
I bought
them from the footpath.
5 pens for Rs. 10
Keep it. No problem. Please keep it.
Thank you so much Sir.
- Thank you so much Sir.
- May God bless you.
Atul brother, tea.
What's the deal?
So much happiness?
Actually, today my elder son's
PMT results are due. -Okay
The papers have gone well.
The coaching classes'
teachers were saying that
At least let the results come first.
-Okay
By the way, since I have
been transferred to the
marriage registrar office,
my life has been quite set.
You definitely earn good karma when you
marry eloped lovers. -You do get it.
I swear, my fate is
shinier than ever.
Careful, there are
steps here, Tanu.
There is one more.
Mikey, you took me to a pickle
factory last time for a surprise.
This better not be
something like that.
Tanu, wait a little bit.
Purshottamji, I asked you to tie a simple
knot, you have tied a sailor's knot.
Yes, son. What rank did you get?
Are you telling me your
rank or mobile number?
It is too bright. Someone
please switch off the lights.
Careful!
Are you hurt?
What if my brother would
have gotten hurt?
Ghatokach, you?
And what are Dritrashtra
and Gandhari doing here?
Mikey, I am done with this!
-Isn't he...?
Are we changing house again? We
2 years of the contract left.
Tanu, I am trying to make the contract for
7 lives and you are stuck on 2 years.
We are getting married.
Look at this, mangalsutra, garland.
-Witness
This was the plan.
Surprise wedding.
Just the way you wanted it.
Cheap, beautiful and long lasting.
Like it?
I completely like it brother.
I knew everything and I
was still surprised.
Where is dad? And your parents?
And my aunt?
We shall Whatsapp the
wedding pictures to them.
Less, yes. But parents
are needed in a wedding.
Sometimes you want to get married
in front of 500 people and
sometimes in front of the driver.
Can you be in a normal state?
You are confusing me.
Brother, I don't mind. I know that sister's
harmonium is changing. I understand.
Oh hello! Drama group. What
is all this happening here?
Oh sir, sorry. How are you?
Actually, I was sitting at home, free.
I was in the mood for marriage. I thought
might as well make it a surprise.
Even mum and dad will be surprised.
Can we fix it for 3:15?
There is a movie show at 3:45.
I was thinking
that the whole family
will watch it together.
Have you read the notice board outside?
No, I didn't read it. I was blindfolded.
wedding I am ready
to pay for it.
Mr. Mikesh, It doesn’t
work like that.
It is written on the website, it is
even there on the notice board.
There is a notice period
of an entire month.
But all of you watch
Bollywood films
and come straight
here to get married.
Miss Saniya, you are smart. You
must be watching English movies?
If you submit the
documents today,
Then you will be allotted a
date that is 30 days away.
And 3 witnesses are required, who are
educated, who know how to sign.
Sir, I have a Non Audible
That too in 2nd class.
Sir the thing is that,
The papers are at home.
If I go home, come
back here and then go
to the mall, it will
be a lengthy detour.
I will come home with you. I
have no other work here.
Why do you come with your problems,
every time to my office?
First, go and read the
notice board carefully.
And you will have
to submit 2 sets of
photocopies, along with
the original documents.
And, if you don’t have original
documents, you will not get a date.
Ms. Saniya, why are you crying?
My passport and pan card
were in the cupboard
and Grandpa burnt it all.
All those original
documents were in....
Shit!
Sister-in-law, don’t cry.
If you want, take my documents.
I just got my pan card made.
Wait a minute everyone.
Sir, there is a problem with
the original documents.
What I am suggesting is that
since both of us are here,
And we are totally in a
mood to get married,
Get u married now, sooner than later.
Please adjust a little.
Work with integrity.
Get your new documents
made, submit them,
Then you shall be
allotted a date.
Please get up now.
Start the process now so you can
get married within a month.
Go!
-Sir...
Sir, we can’t wait for 3 – 4 months.
There is a problem.
You have been together
for so many years,
What will happen
in 3 – 4 months?
Ms. Saniya…
Call an Ola as soon as you eat dessert.
I will be there.
And take care of my sister-in-law.
Give her medicine after 9pm.
Yes, okay.
She is my girl, you go take
care of your mother.
Bloody loser.
What happened? Are you okay?
I am sorry.
My mood swings must be
causing you so much trouble?
And handling me right now
would be so tough for you.
There is nothing like that.
I start crying
anywhere at any time.
Some times in front
of these strangers,
You must be feeling
embarrassing, right?
Be honest with me?
That day we went to the mall,
For some shopping and you held the
mannequin and started crying,
Saying I wish I could wear that;
that was a little embarrassing.
That was too much?
10- 15 minutes are okay,
But you cried for half an hour.
And then the security guards came in.
A crowd formed.
That does make a
little embarrassing.
So I embarrass you now?
A man would be a
little embarrassed.
Now that I am pregnant, you feel
embarrassed to go out with me,
Because I can react
anyhow, anywhere, right?
When did I say that?
Do you realize what I am
going through Mikesh?
Tanu?
There is a compressed version
of a human inside me.
I am preparing to give
birth to our baby.
-I haven’t said anything…
You didn’t say anything?
You are putting forth the point
and then countering it.
What happened to you?
Are you okay?
Because of you, look at you.
You are going to be a
father in 6 months.
You will be responsible
for a human life.
You can’t decide which kind of
dal you want to eat for lunch,
How will you make the big
decisions in the baby’s life?
Both of them look yellow
to me so I get confused.
I will be more decisive about...
...dal. I'll...I’ll try harder.
I’m sorry.
No, no. I am sorry. That
was so horrible to you.
Something is really
wrong with me Mickey.
You think I should go see that tantrik
Mr. Purshottam had recommended?
May be that will help me?
Why are you scaring
me like this Tanu?
What is all this tantrik business?
Wait a little.
There is no need for that.
We shall go to Uncle’s anniversary
dinner then go home,
You will be in deep sleep for 10-
12 hours and you will be fine.
Once you start you don’t stop;
you want to go to a tantric.
You know how weird there suggestions are;
feed imarti to the dogs, do witchcraft.
You know last night I dreamt that our
baby, before saying ma, said cool.
Welcome, welcome,
welcome, son, welcome.
Please take of your
shoes outside.
You never know Goddess Lakshmi might
get upset because of the shoes.
-Sorry, but please don’t mind.
No, it is alright.
Come, please come inside.
How much more Lakshmi (Goddess
of wealth) do you need?
It is very beautiful.
Yes, it is a
beautiful bungalow.
Suchi’s grandfather, before
dying, left it in her name,
And that is why I said yes to her and
I am still reaping the benefits.
Come, come inside.
This is your anniversary gift.
Happy anniversary.
It isn’t my anniversary yet.
It takes place on Radha Jayanti.
There is lots of time to go.
You called us suddenly
for dinner tonight,
so we thought it is
your anniversary.
-I will tell you why I called you.
I thought that it is your...
I will tell you why
I called you.
Come inside now. Sit. I shall
be back in 2 minutes.
Come sit.
I am asking you a
simple question.
Can you answer that?
How can he be rude?
Yes madam, he was
extremely rude.
You serve horrible food
in your restaurant
and all your waiters
are bloody rude.
Yes! First and foremost, stop calling
yourself an authentic Italian restaurant
Because you do not put curry
leaves in bruschetta.
How many weeks?
-14, starting this Friday.
-You?
16.
I am Avantika.
Hi.
This is my husband, Hemant.
Hi I am Tanya. This is Mikesh.
Our friends call us Tankesh.
No, nobody calls us Tankesh.
Tiwari is a nobody.
So, Dr. Mudhati, is
your gynac as well?
Priya. She is going to be
4 in July, 20th July.
Shall I show you the pictures
or will it be, too, typical?
Really?
I am not bothering you, right?
-No, no. -Not at all.
Go and sit there, Mikesh.
I am some kid whom you are
telling to go and sit there?
Her first photo.
It is on a beat, right?
The smiley face won’t
wear off right, if
you throw it against
the wall, too, much?
She loves wearing my shoes.
There is a match between
India and Australia, right?
Don’t know what the score is?
Do watch the match?
Then I don’t watch it.
What are you watching?
Screen savers.
I like the dolphin ones.
They move upon touching.
Touch it.
See?
What?
Why are we here?
Have you thought about it?
It is a very deep question,
Purpose of life, why are we born?
No, I mean this house.
Why are we called here?
I don’t know about here.
There is something
wrong; something’s wrong.
I think his wife has left him.
He is getting divorced.
No, no. Why do you think so?
Do you eat pastry?
-Yes.
You must eat pastry, right?
Yes, I like red velvet.
Now imagine, you
work in a bakery,
In fact, your job profile
is how to handle pastries;
How should this pastry look,
how should this pastry be,
This pastry’s taste isn’t good,
how can this pastry be better,
pastry, pastry, pastry,
pastry, all your life pastry,
pastry, pastry, now would
you like to eat pastry?
pastry then I would
not like to eat them.
Exactly.
He is a gynac.
The person who would look at
the same thing every day,
He would be a little… with it.
Plus,
He couldn’t satisfy his wife.
She got irritated; she left.
No, why not?
People do it.
Hello, hello, hello,
hello, hello everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.
Come, sit on the dining
table, and talk.
Actually, we have
eaten already.
You had your dinner at 8:30?
We finish dinner by 6:30
and sleep by 8:00.
It is the weekend tomorrow,
That is why we are out
this late in the night.
The babysitter won’t
be able to do it.
Until we don’t go,
she won’t sleep.
We better make a move.
No, no, no, no. What
do you mean by...
Please come sit, we have to talk
about something important.
Okay.
I know that but…
-Baby!
But,,,no, no, I
told you before,
I can’t delete that tweet.
I have to be honest. I am...
Okay, send me the refund and
I will see what I can do.
Okay.
Sorry, sorry so sorry guys.
I am really sorry.
Professional hazards of
being a food critic.
-Blogger.
Same thing.
So, what is this? Some kind
of pregnant parents meet?
First of all, I would
like to express that I am
very happy that all of
us have met together.
Hemant, Avantika,
I know them since 5 years and they
were my first customer, uh, patients.
It was their first baby
and my first case, right?
This is Miku, my
nephew, Mikesh.
And this is…
what’s your name?
-Tanya.
Tanya. I am so sorry,
my handwriting is so
bad that sometimes,
I write and forget
my patients’ name.
I can’t read it.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Chhabria.
I know their father
since Delhi.
I am Agnivesh, this is Shivani.
Hi, goddessoftastebuds.in,
my site.
You must check it out. I
review all kinds of cuisines,
Indian, Chinese, Continental,
mostly continental.
One minute, I had an
important thing to say.
Oh, sorry. I thought
he was done talking.
You guys are my
favourite patients,
And that is why we are here.
You must be thinking that,
Dr. Mudhit never offers
you a cup of tea,
And today he is offering
you a cup of tea.
But there is no
personal greed in this.
Ok.
I am helping one of you.
Now I will explain how
I am helping you.
I have a brother called Dinesh.
He is an amazing astrologer.
I randomly told him one day that these days
my planets are not aligned in my favour,
Help me by doing a few for me.
If you fix you your deeds, all your
planets will align and become correct.
I wondered how such a pure and religious
doctor like me did anything wrong.
Then I remembered that
I committed one sin.
I have committed
one big mistake,
And that is why Goddess
Lakshmi is upset with me.
And I will have correct
this mistake of mine,
And I will correct
this mistake today.
But what is the mistake
I have committed?
dancing in the jungle but who has seen it?
I have seen it.
I saw everything.
And I have seen this.
And this is the big mistake
that I have made.
I want that I should tell them.
But then I wonder, why I should
tell them, I am not a snitch!
Why I should I tell them?
It is wrong to
gossip, isn’t it?
Then Suchi, my wife,
Gave me an idea,
She is very smart.
If she didn’t get physical
in small fights,
Then there wouldn’t be better
wife material than her.
She is amazing.
So she told me that for
example, if I told you,
That you have dung
stuck on your shoe,
What will you do, then?
You will lift your left leg first,
You will be sure that it is
stuck to your right shoe.
But if I tell you that,
In your shoes rack, one sandal
or shoe has dung stuck on it
Shit.
That means you have
to do a lot work,
But one thing still stands that,
You will be free of your sin,
You won't fill guilty,
As you haven’t gossiped
about a particular shoe.
Doctor, I am not understanding what
exactly you are trying to say.
If it isn’t important,
then both of would leave.
It is important. If it
weren’t important then,
would I be wasting my time here?
It is important.
One of your shoe has
shit, dung stuck on it.
Uncle, you asked us to
remove our shoes, outside.
If you say it, we can go
outside and check it.
I am telling you that one of you
is cheating on your partner.
Please solve it among
yourselves as to who it is,
Make me guilt free. I am not
telling people who it is.
From now onwards, I will be quiet.
What?
...at this table who is cheating.
Like someone on this table is
cheating on their? -Spouse.
So,
Why don’t you directly
take the name?
Why are you playing this sick twisted
game with us? This is not cool.
You called us for dinner and you
are paying this game, why?
He is our uncle.
So what? What is
wrong is wrong.
This is a lot of nonsense
and am really sorry but,
I don’t want to be involved in this.
We have to go. We already late.
-Absolutely.
Wait, wait. We can’t just
leave like this guys.
One second. -What happened?
I am fine.
If one of us here,
like doctor said, is
guilty of adultery, then,
Then,
There is also a
victim here, guys.
-But…
No but,
But don’t you think we
owe it to her or him?
We need to sit down and
sort this out; right now.
Excuse me,
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
It is definitely not us.
Our sex life is rocking.
It's like Exhibit A.
Look out for yourselves.
We are good.
Oh! By that logic, this
is exhibit B and that
is exhibit C, and the
conversation is over.
We need to go step by step.
Guys, don’t worry, I am here.
-So she is now a reader.
And being an author myself...
-Blogger.
Author myself,
I know how to handle
these mysteries. Okay?
Person to person to person.
Yes. We will have to check
every one, one by one.
Baby?
What?
Check it.
No, I don’t need to check it.
I check it anyway, every
time you go for a shower.
You haven’t done anything
like it, right?
Can I be honest?
Shivani, I love you.
But I can’t be romantic.
You know my schedule.
I go for a jog at 6 in the
morning and then office at 8.
You can check the CCTV footage.
I am there till 8:30.
I am back home by 9:00. I am with
you on holidays and weekends.
Even if I want to Shivani, I don’t
have the tie to cheat on you,
How did he say that, so fast!
He has memorized it at home.
Look,
Look, I know your schedule
and all, but after that,
Roma incident, I am
not really sure.
Baby, that was long time ago.
And we were not even
committed then.
It has been 5 years since
I broke up with her.
Last I heard, she was
somewhere in Australia.
Now don’t say that I have
online sex with her.
Why can’t you do it? There are
ways to do that. Right, Tanu?
Listen guys, you two specially,
Just because I am the best looking guy on
this table doesn’t mean you pick on me.
No, come on, it is not my fault
that I have a perfect jawline.
-And now we have a Casanova.
And Shivani, please
be rational.
I had my bachelor party
organized by you.
I am saving my EL, so
that next month,
we can go and meet your
sister in London.
I take a silly lunch
box to office.
You know how much this
marriage means to me, right?
Yes, yes, I know.
-No, you don’t.
I do. But...
...I had to check, right?
This?
Before my husband I had
only one boyfriend.
But he is in jail now.
So that rules out my
possibility, right?
And,
Femina fact,
85% of extra-marital affairs
happen with previous partners.
-I read that.
Yeah?
Yeah!
So first step,
Talk to your partner
about their exes.
Okay, guys, are we really
going to do this?
Yes of course.
-No. No. No.
Are we going to participate
in this silly game?
We have to.
-No. No. No.
This is so juvenile.
-This is not happening.
-I just want to go home.
-No why?
-Seriously?
-Absolute nonsense.
What?
What?
They show it in
Hollywood movies,
the one who is the least doubted,
is always the criminal.
So are you saying that I am?
No, no. Not at all.
Doubting was trending so I
doubted you otherwise never.
You know, we are 100% committed.
I was in US for 4 years.
I was alone there and
Tanu was alone here.
But we never felt the
need of anybody else.
And he was calling
me a murderer.
Hey you, with the
perfect jawline,
-So what?
I know what it sounds like
when I am saying such things,
But there is no possibility
of such things,
I may slip, but Tanu would never
do something like that.
Okay we believe you.
Let’s believe that you
guys are off the hook,
For now at least.
What about you guys?
What about us?
Aren’t you guys, too, quiet?
Nice observation Shivani.
I almost missed this.
Because it is better to keep
quiet than to keep saying
stupid things all the time
that also very loudly.
-Thank you.
Oh, yeah?
So everybody is stupid on this table
except for the 2 of you, right?
By everybody, you mean, you
two and Mikesh, right?
One second, I am going to come back to you.
You are next.
Oh ya? I am so scared.
-What to say?
You guys.
Yeah, we are listening to you.
Why were you guys in
such a hurry to leave?
Hercule Poirot, I have a 3 year
old daughter who needs to sleep.
Yeah, okay.
But didn’t you once doubt your husband
that he could be the one cheating on you?
No.
Not at all?
-No.
Are you sure?
I said no.
And you sir?
Sir, Shivani, is
asking you something.
Your reality show strategies
won’t work here. Just because
you are silent, doesn’t
mean no one will doubt you.
Speak up!
I am feeling sleepy.
I think you are quieter
than required.
Of course. You guys are
squabbling over like children,
So I am quiet and I am sleepy.
Hemant, this is the time to talk. Just
tell them that it is not like that.
They are pointing fingers at you.
They are accusing you.
Just open your mouth and say it.
-Are you mad?
Do you really think I
am going to explain
myself to these high
school musical kids?
You trust me right? Then I
needn’t give any explanations.
I don’t understand why you
are getting so defensive.
You can just say no.
Defensive?
-Yes.
You don’t know my schedule?
I wake up at 7 to go
and give a lecture.
I am habituated to
sleeping early.
The children sleep if the
teacher yawns even once.
You know what
happened yesterday?
A jat boy, on the last bench,
wore a blanket and slept.
Look at these guys…
No, no, one second.
Are you a deep sleeper?
Excuse me?
No, I was just being curious.
What happens is that I sleep
for only 5 hours a night,
But I am a very deep sleeper.
It doesn’t bother me even if there are
drums being played loudly near my ear.
It looks like you would be sleeping
for at least 10 to 12 hours a day.
I am just wondering that within
the hours that you sleep,
You are the man. That
was a very good point!
Oh shut up! Don’t listen
to these people.
Are you guys mad?
You don’t even know me
to make us acquisitions.
What’s wrong?
Who is Sheetal?
It's over.
Who keeps sending
you happy messages?
It was a happy teacher’s
day message.
She is my student.
I am her guide.
Student! Child?
Look at how he is
making her repay!
Listen to me, ok.
Stop saying that.
Are you mad?
That same day Ketan, Vivek
and Sameer messaged me,
You didn’t remember any of these
names but you remembered Sheetal?
If it isn’t you then who is it?
It isn’t Hemant, right?
Ask these people.
And, her?
Since the time she is here,
she is on the phone.
Maybe she is talking to a restaurant
owner or not, how do we know?
Classic guilty
person behaviour.
Immediately shifted all
the blame to her.
You haven’t even answered her question.
Who is Sheetal, sir?
Why are you guys cornering me?
Guys, it is me okay?
I am really sorry everyone.
I am so sorry.
I knew it! I knew it!
Baby, I had a gut feeling
from the beginning.
Did you see her body language?
She was so defensive.
It is over baby, its over.
She can't be...
These moods swings have been
going on since the past 2 week.
She is talking rubbish.
I am so sorry Mikesh.
I don’t know how you came to
know, I don’t understand.
Wait,
I think you should talk about
this here, in front of us.
What?
What if you are lying?
What if you are doing this
to get away from here?
How will that matter to you?
And the cheater is here,
Then one of us will never find out
that our partner is cheating on us.
Avantika?
Have doubts on me?
I have just showed
you everything. -Yes!
Prove it.
Prove to us that you
are cheating on him.
What, you guys?
No, I’ll tell you.
Mikesh when you were in the US,
I used to get really lonely,
Leo used to come to
the house sometimes,
To just talk.
-Leo?
Ya, Leo.
One minute.
This is wrong.
What happened? You said you
weren’t going to say a word.
If nobody is able to catch your
lie, I will have to speak up.
-Uncle?
No, Tanya, this is wrong.
No.
I am already doing so much
to get away from one sin,
By spinning this lie, you are
involving me in another sin.
No, she isn’t the one.
Look son, trust me.
She isn’t the one.
Tanu! What are you doing?
You are lying?
Feel my heartbeat, it has
gone off the charts.
Come here.
Non Audible
You are taking leo’s name.
He is a slut.
No but this is not done.
You are cheating in
a game of cheating.
Why are you suddenly
defending people?
Like this, you will save
everybody one by one.
And when the blame was on us,
why didn’t you say something?
Okay, I will be quiet again.
Doctor, now you have
to say something.
Uncle, I am telling
you, these two are
speaking the most, it
has to be one of them.
Come on! He started again.
He has said she isn’t cheating,
it could be that you are.
-Me? I am cheating?
Ya!
-Yes!
I am cheating?
Firstly, I am noticing that
since you have come here,
You have been saying it happens,
it happens. What happens?
It happens.
Look at him, again.
I will tell you uncle
what happens.
When you were over
there making tea,
He was sitting here and saying that you
weren’t satisfying Aunty, sexually,
That is why she left you.
I have written a research
papers on female orgasms.
She was crazy about me.
She is no more?
That's sick.
Uncle, now tell us what to do.
I spoke to your father recently, he
didn’t tell me anything about it.
Uncle,
What did we do about
this suspense?
I don’t want to talk about it.
I am going to stay quiet.
I have a solution.
You please let it be. You
will again say it happens.
If it happens, it happens
I am not playing.
It is not a game.
Tell us. Tell us what
the solution is.
What I am saying is,
If the person who is having
the extra marital, is here,
Then his/ her phone will contain
some trace of it for sure.
There is Whatsapp,
messages, pics, somewhere
or the other there
will be a trace of it.
Yeah, yeah.
According to me, we should
check each other’s phones.
Hold on,
This is blatant invasion of privacy. ok.
There are so many personal
details on a phone.
I can’t just give
it to a stranger.
Desperate times call for
desperate measures.
I have nothing to hide,
anybody can check my phone,
But I would like to check
yours; especially yours.
Unless and until there is something
objectionable in it. I don't know.
I am not showing my phone.
Hemant, what problem do you have? They are
asking, show it to them. Show it to him.
Avantika, you know I
don’t remember things.
I have stored my ATM
pins, email passwords,
Everything here and I
should just give it away?
Oh, come on! Who is interested
in your email passwords?
She is your wife. Show it to her or do
you have a problem with that as well?
Oh, okay then. So,
it is decided then.
I shall explain the rules
to everyone once more, ok.
In this round, we shall check
each other’s phones. That’s it.
It is a game for her.
Ok. That's it. Come on.
Sorry baby but I am going to
have to check yours again.
No, you don’t have to be sorry
and please give me yours.
Tanu.
I don’t want to see. I know you
wouldn’t do anything. So, relax.
Tanu? Do you see me as
completely worthless?
I agree that I haven’t done anything
but can doubt me a little bit, right?
Look at them doubting
each other.
Please keep my image in mind.
Okay, give.
Checked.
-Me, too.
Not that I ever doubted.
It isn’t Shivani.
So that leaves the
three of you.
You know, baby,
I am almost sure it
is one of them.
Doctor, can we take a
vote and make decision?
Can you please stop it?
Stop it guys.
Can you please stop
picking on them?
Why? What’s your problem?
Have you noticed baby,
That even last time when we
were talking about them,
Oh, my God!
You are trying to save them.
No. Agatha Christie I am
not trying to save them.
But you know something that we don’t.
You are trying to protect them.
We don’t need to be protected,
we can take care of ourselves.
Thank you so much.
You know, no. I think
they need to know.
-Yes!
Hemant and Avantika over here.
They have a 3 year old autistic
daughter at home. -Oh, my God!
And I was not trying
to protect them,
I was trying to help
them get out of here,
Because they usually don’t
get out of the house.
Until they don’t reach home,
their daughter won’t sleep.
So please, can you let them be?
Spare them.
I am not trying to
sympathize with you.
This is not relevant to
this discussion. Please. -Stupid.
Getting my daughter involved.
-No, it is.
It is relevant.
And that explains everything.
What? What does that explain?
keep your emotions
aside and think about,
Why one cheats on
their partner?
Why, why do they cheat?
Maybe because they aren’t happy in
their present relationship or family.
Right? And...
...and I am not saying anything
and I am not judging them,
But look at them. Do
they look happy to you?
No, they don’t and why?
Because it is not their fault,
They are genuinely stuck
with a handicapped child.
Autism is not a handicap.
What’s wrong with you?
-Enough!
I am not saying that. -Enough!
Stop it before I do
something stupid.
Why should I stop it?
Because of you guys, my wife is
doubting me, I didn’t say anything.
If you don’t find happiness
in your happiness,
can you let the happiness
stay in my house?
And only when a person is not happy in
their home, he goes outside to find it.
I will beat the
shit out of you.
-Move it! -Oh, shut up!
Calm down. What happened to you?
No but this is what happens.
When a person does not
I am talking to him calmly.
Now will you do something? Or do you still
want to watch and get entertained?
Say something and end this.
Please!
-These people are
just not worth it.
Look at them. There is a
limit to selfishness.
They can’t take care of one child and
they are preparing for another.
-Please stop your nonsense.
No, please try to understand
what I am trying to say.
Do you know what the population
of this country is?
If you don’t know, travel with
me in 6:00am local train.
There is so much rush in the morning
train that it will boggle your mind.
As if we don’t know.
One second,
Do you jog at 6:00am
in the local train?
We are talking about
something else.
Come on! I am not saying that.
But didn’t you just say that you
went jogging at 6 in the morning,
And now you are saying that you are
catch a local train in the morning?
So, I am getting confused.
Because if you do jog in the train,
you will cover more distance,
But if you apply relative motion,
Does anybody have
a pen and paper?
One second, You are not
understanding what I am saying.
You are confusing people.
I go for jogging
to the stadium.
But you can go there
by car as well.
Baby, I do go by car. But I…
Chanting in Sanskrit
What?
You are cheating on me?
And that, too, at 6 in the morning.
So much dedication!
People get up at 6 in the
morning and do yoga for health,
And you do “this” at
six in the morning?
Miku! You are a genius, son.
Genius!
And you were spreading
rumours about me?
Mrs. Chhabbra, I went to the
Siddhivinayak temple to pray.
Ask him who he was standing outside with.
Who was she?
Who was it?
Who was it?
Was it Roma?
No baby. You know
Roma is in Australia.
Roma is not in Australia but in Ghatkopar.
They meet at a hotel.
I have a record of
the past 15 days.
Ghatkopar?
But why baby?
Baby, why?
What why baby?
Can’t you see what’s happening?
Have you no idea?
And I have told you several
times that I am just
28 and I am not ready
to start a family now.
I am not able to handle
the stress of my career,
And I am not a super hero that I
will be able to do everything,
And I have explained this
to you, but you refused.
Baby, I can’t be a
father right now.
I am not cut out for this job.
Roma was only because I needed an escape
and she just happened to be there.
She just happened to be there?
And what about us?
What about our future?
What about Brooklyn?
And this is how you choose
to break it to me?
I need to call my parents.
Listen, Shivani.
Please listen to me.
Baby there is nothing emotional...
-Stop talking nonsense.
I know I am talking stupidly.
-Shut up!
And, you. Couldn’t you tell me this in
person instead of calling me to dinner?
You know what doctor, I should
have done this long before.
You are fired.
I am moving to Dr. Mehta.
Dr. Mehta has fake degrees.
What are you doing?
If you search for ovary on Google, I am
the first result on the third page.
Avantika, I am so sorry.
You had to hear so much because of me.
I am really very sorry.
-It is okay.
So sorry.
We have to hear a lot
worse in public places.
-I am sorry.
Don’t worry about it.
Hemant it is very late Priya wouldn’t
have slept. -Yes, carefully.
She just doesn't
sleep without me.
Please call Rashmi once.
Have you checked her messages?
-Excuse me, Hemant?
Can I ask you a question,
if you don’t mind?
I am always skeptical of
people who ask questions
with disclaimers. Please
go ahead and ask.
Don’t you feel like...
Don’t you feel
trapped sometimes?
Like when you have a kid, the
whole life is centered on it?
They have so many special requirements.
You can’t have your leisure time.
It is nothing like that.
-It is nothing like that.
That now we wouldn’t be able to
go clubbing or go partying.
And this one here
was a wild one.
We thought we would always be stuck
at home and our life will change.
But, honestly, our
life did change.
You know when we talk to our
children, play with her,
Tell her stories, try to listen
to what she has to say,
We never realized that all of
this would be so enjoyable.
And, it is beautiful. It is tough for
me to explain but it beautiful.
There are so many
responsibilities.
What keeps you going?
Actually, yeah.
The child keeps us going.
It is your first that is why
you won’t understand it,
But once you become parents,
you understand everything.
You remember when we were children, we
used to make mustaches with pencils,
Wear our father’s shoes and wear
a big coat, mimic the elders.
I think there are still
people out there,
Who are just pretending
to be adults,
They never became adults.
Have you become an adult?
I don’t know.
Yes, I think.
You know the first time you
see your child’s face,
There is different feeling that
tells you that you have grown up.
Don't worry.
I swear to God, the first time
that you see your child,
It is beautiful. Your life will
change and trust me, for the better.
Smile guys. Come on.
It is Rashmi’s phone. Priya must
be really anxious. Yes. Let’s go.
-Guys really sorry bye bye.
Sorry got to go.
It was great meeting you.
Take care guys.
Yes, Rashmi, we will be
reaching in half an hour.
What happened Mickey?
How will it happen?
What “how will it happen?”
You were right.
I can barely peel a boiled egg.
How will I handle a child?
You will manage, don’t worry.
You know Tiwari’s
brother had a child,
I was playing with him.
I almost dropped him.
Tiwari caught him
at the last minute.
Hemant is such a mature man.
I am complete fool.
No Tanu, I am saying
the correct thing.
Remember Avinash was
saying that there is a lot
of pressure, you have to
manage a lot of things,
And even super heroes aren’t
able to manage such things.
Have you ever seen Batman or Superman
getting married and raising children?
If they are not able to do it,
then how will I be able to do it?
I know you will do everything. I was
raised by one such super hero so I know.
You father is capable
of so many things.
I am nowhere close
to a super hero.
You are.
I don’t know about
Superman and Batman,
You are my super hero.
You are nice man.
Nice man.
Cool.
They should have
comics of Nice man.
Nice man comics.
Nice man v/s bad boys.
