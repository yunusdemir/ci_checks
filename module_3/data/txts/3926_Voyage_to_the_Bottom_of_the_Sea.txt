- Here we are.
- Thank you.
- Mayl have a glass ofmilk, please?
- Certainly.
I'll be right back.
It never ceases to amaze me.
One houryou are flying over wide-open
Western spaces that seem to never end...
and then the next hour...
you start seeing the cities
of the Eastern seaboard.
And they seem to never end.
<i>Exactly.</i>
This your first trip to Washington?
Ah, but of course not.
You must make this trip so many times...
-you feel like a commuter.
- Mm-hmm.
Sometimes it does feel like that.
- Here we are.
- Thank you.
- No, thanks.
- I'm sorry, sir.
It's right there in
my stewardess's manual.
I'm not allowed to
take no for an answer.
- Even if I'm not hungry?
- Especially ifyou're not hungry.
All right.
I'll just have coffee.
We are starting our descent.
And so we are.
I guess he was more tired than hungry.
Ifeveryone remains quietly
in their seats, nobody will get hurt.
<i>This is not a robbery.</i>
That's very foolish.
Sit down.
Should anyone feel brave...
I would suggest that
you glance to the rear...
<i>and I would suggest also
that you put on your seat belts.</i>
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
<i>Starring Richard Basehart...</i>
<i>David Hedison.</i>
Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea.
And that's as much as I know, Chip.
The admiral can't just have vanished.
There has to be some trace, somewhere.
Well, Washington's checking out
every possible angle.
- Do we continue on to Norfolk?
- Mm-hmm.
Pending further orders.
Good afternoon, Admiral Nelson.
Let me help you.
Please.
Anything but, “Where am I?“
Aha. You recognize me.
Schroder?
Colonel Alfried Schroder.
Standartenfclfhrer Al fri ecl Sch roder-
Even on this forgotten edge of nowhere,
we must try to observe the amenities.
You- You really are... Alfried Schroder!
Please, Admiral
No anger, no moral indignation.
You're much too weak for that.
<i>You've been under sedation
for over two days now...</i>
<i>making your journey halfiA/ay
across the world to here.</i>
I imagineyour coordination
isn't all it should be.
I remember now.
The airplane.
Then you must also remember
one of your fellow passengers.
<i>Leutnant Demen.</i>
Now that he is conscious,
shall I put him in with the others?
Nexh, Carl. Admiral Nelson
is one of my special guests.
I will escort him personally.
One more thing: There are highly trained,
armed men all around here.
<i>I merely say this with the hope
that you will dismiss...</i>
<i>all the wildly heroic thoughts
that are running through your mind?</i>
<i>Danke.</i>
We are people of habit, aren't we?
<i>Give us a few pieces of good timber, a few yards
of barbed wire, and what do we do?</i>
We do what we know how to do best.
I trust you've given up
any further attempts on my life.
You wouldn't have any better
luck than the others anyway.
I have survived attacking armies,
the collapse of my panzer divisions...
the bombings of Berlin,
the shelling and burning of our bunker-
- And a 30-year manhunt by the free world.
- Yes. And that too.
I have been hunted like an animal.
I've hidden in...
<i>the sewers of the world,
like a criminal.</i>
And through it all, I survived.
Yes. You people always seem to survive.
You won the war,
and you think you are heroes.
You call yourselffreejust men,
while you label us...
<i>war criminals.</i>
Well, the whole world
labeled you war criminals.
All that is ancient history now.
All our concern is here and now!
I'll show you to your quarters.
Aren't you the slightest bit curious
as to why I brought you here?
I've got a hunch
I couldn't stop you from telling me.
I've spent so many years
planning and waiting.
Would you begrudge me my small pleasure
at the fruition of my plan?
<i>That newsreel film I was watching.</i>
<i>It was taken in
the sports arena in Berlin.</i>
At the first anniversary
of our FUhrer assuming absolute power.
- You understand German?
- No.
<i>Pity. The language of poets.</i>
Not always.
That day in the sports arena-
Our FUhrerwas telling us of his plans...
for a thousand-year <i>Reich.</i>
Which lasted exactly 19 years.
You disappoint me, Admiral
I had expected you...
to regard World War ll as it was-
a minor engagement in a battle
that can only eventually end...
- in our victory.
- <i>Our</i> victory?
Those last hours in Berlin...
the FUhrer decreed that
I was to take command...
of rebuilding the Fourth Reich
on the ashes of the Third.
No, no, no.
No, Admiral
This is no idle dream.
We've been working very hard these years.
Drilling a dedicated cadre...
rebuilding our strengths,
assembling our forces- oh!
I have gathered great minds here-
<i>scientists, military geniuses,
theoreticians.</i>
And now, we come to you, Admiral
The future of this planet
lies in its oceans.
<i>You are the world's
foremost marine scientist.</i>
I think it's only right
that you should be in charge...
of all the maritime projects
for the Fourth Reich.
You're as insane as your FUhrer was.
You will agree to join us.
Now, or after some persuasion.
Not now or later.
We'll see.
Come. May I introduce you
to your distinguished companions?
Gentlemen,
please meet Admiral Nelson.
Admiral, mayl present
Dr. Gustave Reinhardt?
Gustave Reinhardt?
You're supposed to be dead.
I am.We all are!
- At least, as good as dead.
- That accident, three years ago...
made headlines all over the world.
Yes, Schroder showed them to me.
It's not every man who gets
to read his own obituaries.
They called you
the world's foremost psychologist.
<i>A t least, now you know that
your life's work has been appreciated.</i>
So much so that I went to the trouble
ofcrashing an airliner to bring you here.
<i>Fortunes of war, Doctor.</i>
And here, we have... Anton Miklos.
My own private nuclear scientist.
I attended your Oxford lectures
on new methods of exploding the neutron.
Mm. That was long ago, before
I disappeared, never to be seen again.
Oh, don't despair. When I am ready, the world
will again hear a great deal about you.
And this is... Benjamin Brewster.
I know Mr. Brewster's work.
Probably the world's top authority...
- on electronics until-
- Until his untimely death
in that nasty skiing accident.
Someday I might tell you
who is really buried under that avalanche.
If I'm ever convinced that too much
knowledge is not a dangerous thing.
And here's a man who lays
no claim to genius at all.
- Tomas Brandig is merely
the world's greatest athlete.
- I read the sport pages.
<i>Three times Olympic
decathlon champion.</i>
And all it meant was
a one-way ticket to here.
<i>One-way tickets only...</i>
if you all continue to stubbornly cling...
to your ridiculously outmoded ideas.
But there'll be enough time
for indoctrination.
<i>I will leave you now, to let you become
better acquainted with your companions.</i>
Oh, and you might tell
Admiral Nelson...
how impossible
his ideas of escape are.
Good day, gentlemen.
Now you are wondering
what we all first wondered, eh?
<i>Why Schroder took so much trouble
to drag us all here...</i>
to this tiny spot on no one's map?
Can't you see, Admiral?
<i>We</i> are the new master race.
Welcome aboard.
- Thisjust came in on top priority circuit.
- More bad news?
More no news.
He couldn't have
just vanished without a trace.
Washington has their top agents on it.
They'll come up with an answer.
They'll come up with nothing,
just as they have for the past two weeks.
There must be something we can do.
Some way we can help find him.
We can't just sit around here
and let him break us down one by one.
- What else are we to do?
- Fight back.
Against that?
With our bare hands?
Even David had a sling
when he took on Goliath.
But we have a weapon,
the best weapon in the world: brains.
So does he.
Ahh. I see you're
getting better acquainted.
Admiral Nelson,
could we have a talk for a moment or two?
Between the two of us,
have you made any plans to escape?
<i>Get it out of your system...</i>
<i>so we can get down
to serious discussions about the future.</i>
Uh, if I were you, I would wait
till the next changing guards...
and then storm the main gate.
Korpora/ Wendt is then on duty,
and he is a terrible shot.
But of course, he makes
a very passable sauerbraten...
and one does have to make
compromises in this day and age.
Doesn't one?
Carl, I think we have time
for a game of chess...
while these gentlemen
plan their little escape.
<i>AufWiedersehe-n, mein Herren.</i>
With that kind of conceit...
you'd think that he'd won the war
instead of having lost it.
It's not just conceit.
The Prussian military mind...
is a marvelously... precise mechanism.
Tough. Unyielding.
Instinctively brutal.
<i>Highly complex
and yet at the same time...</i>
<i>almost completely predictable.</i>
Underneath all this bravado...
Herr Schrodefs quite tense now.
I'd say he's close to making this master
move he's been planning all these years.
That's a masterly analysis.
In my office, I'd make $60 an hour
for less than that.
Ifwhat you say is true,
something must have happened recently...
- to complete his plans.
- You have happened, Admiral.
Your capture makes
everything complete.
<i>With you, he intends to control
the oceans of the world.</i>
With me, nuclear power.
<i>With Brewster, conventional
power and communications.</i>
And with Tomas here, he plans
fashioning a new breed ofsupermen.
<i>Through me, he plans to control
their minds. That's what he told me...</i>
six years ago,
when he first imprisoned me.
All he needs is a nucleus
for the master race.
<i>Then he can strike and win easily.</i>
Getting us all here is one thing.
Getting us all to work
on his side is quite another.
He'll get us all to join him.
Make no mistake about that.
When Herr Schroder
sets his mind to it...
he'll break us, one by one.
He used to be quite expert
at that in the old days.
That's all the more reason to act,
right now.
If I could just get my hands
around Schrodefs neck.
<i>That would accomplish precisely nothing,
because then Deiner...</i>
or one of the others would simply...
step into his place.
Brewster's right.
It's the idea that has to be destroyed,
not just the man.
- And we can't do that here.
- Escape is impossible.
Even if we get away from the camp,
where can we go?
I've checked our positions
with both the sun and the stars.
This island is thousands ofmiles from the
remotest shipping lanes, let alone civilization.
We're not just going
to roll over and play dead.
If we can't escape
to the outside world...
we're going to bring
the outside world right here.
N ow-
Ah, what we need is another bulb.
<i>This is the last of them,
except for the light you're working by.</i>
Well, with a little bit ofluck,
it should bejust about enough.
- Hammer, please.
- Mm.
We can really send out shortwave
radio signals with that?
In theory, yes.
- [Taps 1
-Thank you.
Now.
Someone is coming!
It's Tomas.
- I got it. Nobody saw me.
- From the electric fence?
No. I found some wrapped
around one of the tower posts.
- Your hands.
- I didn't have anything to cut the wire.
- Had to pull it loose.
- Dr. Reinhardt.
- Here.
- Attach this.
To the light socket.
There.
- Now that shouldjust about do it.
- Indeed it should.
Uh, one-
Now. lfwe couldjustfind
something to act as a sending key-
How about that? Huh?
Fine! That's just
what the doctor ordered.
We're a whole blooming radio station.
Now if I canjust reach the right people.
Admiral? Be my guest.
Still nothing, Captain.
- Not even a wrong number.
- Keep at it.
Captain, when you asked me
about shortwave...
I said a signal could
carry around the world.
- But that's theory.
- Oh, I know.
But all we can do is stay with it.
Monitor the international wavelengths,
as well as our own emergency band.
- And the low-frequency bands.
- Yes, sir.
It's almost dawn.
Well, I can keep sending
for a few minutes yet.
We don't even know
ifanyone can hear us.
That's why we have
to keep on trying.
Every night.
As long as we can.
Captain Crane!
- Crane here.
- Captain, I think I'm picking something up.
It's a C.W. signal
that sounds like our code.
Put it on the amplifier.
- It's Admiral Nelson!
- Mr. Morton.
<i>On the double! Get us a fix
on the radio direction finder.</i>
The admiral's alive...
<i>And he's sending out</i> a <i>road map loud and clear.</i>
Now here's our destination. It's not
too far away, so let's get moving fast.
Sparks, send a reply,
just in case he's got a receiver too.
<i>“Message received, loud and clear.</i>
<i>The cavalry is on its way. Crane."</i>
The Seaview has received
Nelson's message.
They are coming full speed.
To the rescue!
M <i>m.</i>
It's still more than a day away.
- But we're moving at full speed.
- Well, it's not fast enough.
See if the engine room crew
has a trick or two up their sleeve.
<i>Iawohl.</i>
<i>Admiral Nelson.</i>
First, let me compliment you
on being so resourceful.
I had allowed you three days
to build your shortwave radio...
<i>and you did it in one single day</i>
<i>Which puts us more than
two days ahead of schedule.</i>
You see, Carl, never underestimate...
scientific ingenuity.
You, um-
You knew about the radio all the time?
I didn't only <i>know</i> about it.
I had planned on it.
<i>You see, Admiral...</i>
you are just a small pawn
on the chessboard.
<i>Or perhaps a more apt description
of your role in my plans...</i>
would be... bait.
<i>- Bah?
- Exactly.</i>
Thanks to your noble efforts...
the Seaview is coming here,
at full speed.
<i>Straight into the very special
welcome we have prepared for it.</i>
Nota chance.
The Seavfew? not within
10,000 miles of here.
Wishful thinking, Admiral
If you had built a receiving set
as well as a sending set...
you would have gotten this reply...
<i>From your Captain Crane.</i>
You see?
Everything is going according to plan.
<i>That would be very foolish, Admiral.</i>
Yes. It would be.
Especially since you have
served your purpose...
and we really have no longer
much reason to keep you alive.
Now. As you've been so very helpful...
I think it only fitting to tell you...
how the Seaview is going
to serve the Fourth Reich.
After we capture the vessel,
we will place our own crew aboard.
And we will sail... to here.
Don't you notice anything of...
particular interest...
<i>about the spot I'm pointing to?</i>
It seems equidistant
to Washington or Moscow.
And with both cities well within
the range of the nuclear missiles...
carried aboard the <i>Seaview.</i>
Now, tell me, Admiral.
What do you think would happen...
<i>after we fire two missiles,
simultaneously-</i>
one at Washington...
and one at Moscow.
Right again.
The United States and Russia
would immediately retaliate...
with all the power at their command.
Holocaust.
Awful nuclear holocaust.
<i>Such as the world has never seen.</i>
Even something like you
couldn't want that.
No one could gain from
that kind of destruction.
Wrong.
Very wrong.
A whole world is to be gained.
We will trigger it.
Then sit back...
while all the major powers
of the world destroy each other.
And when everything is ashes...
we will strike out from this island.
And on those ashes
build the Fourth Reich-
<i>a Reich truly destined...</i>
<i>to last 1,000 years.</i>
You can't do it, Schroder!
You'd be destroying millions ofiives.
Your lesson in political science
is over, Admiral
Now that the Seaview is going
to be here in a couple of hours...
<i>I have a great deal of work to do.</i>
But you must have some feeling,
some-some emotions.
Do you walk,
or do we have to drag you?
I believe you have a shortwave radio
hidden in this hut.
Now, gentlemen...
you know that is contrary
to all camp rules.
Give it to them.
They know all about it anyway.
Fascinating. Ingenious!
Building one radio from nothing
is quite an achievement.
But I'm afraid it's going
to have to stop right there.
You gentlemen will just have
to rest on your... laurels.
<i>Well, what a coincidence.
Nelson goes to headquarters
for a quiet little tete-é-tete.
Deiner comes right back here
and confiscates our radio.
I told you.
- They knew all about the radio.
- Oh, really?
But what about the extra food
that Schroder always gives to prisoners...
with whom he's particularly
pleased, hmm?
- Gentlemen, gentlemen!
-Well, it had to be him.
- How else could they know?
- What would be the sense of that?
I was the one who had you make it.
Why would I tell Schroder about it?
Divide and conquer.
Divide some more and conquer some more.
How did the Schroders of this world
become so good at it?
I'm sorry.
I know you're upset about the radio.
I shouldn't have taken offense so easily.
No, you had every right.
I was completely wrong.
L-I'm sorry.
I apologize.
All right. Now that the dissension
in the ranks is settled...
what'll we do about the enemy?
Well, the enemy seems
to have the situation too well in hand.
Even these-
these walls may have ears.
Schroder had me brought to his office
so he could do a little crowing.
But what he really wanted
was the <i>Seaview.</i>
And he had to tell me
how we'd played right into his hands.
The engine room was just on the intercom.
No power system...
is supposed to be run
this long at full speed.
- <i>The reactor? getting heated</i>
- <i>How bad</i> is <i>it?</i>
Right now, it's just
giving out warning signals.
But if we keep on
running at full speed-
There hasn't been any more radio signals.
We don't know what's happening
to the admiral on the island.
We have to keep running at full speed
for the next five or six hours.
Okay. You're the skipper.
Engine Room, this is the bridge. We need
at least six more hours at full speed.
<i>But, Mr. Morton,
this reactor? getting hot.</i>
So, it's getting hot.
The captain says full speed.
Well, that's it. He intends
to set fire to most of the world...
so he can rule over
what little of it is left.
Ah, even Schroder.
Can he do this?
- Then we must stop him.
- But what we must do and what we can do...
are two entirely different things,
aren't they?
- We can at least try.
- We did try. Schroder toyed with us...
for a few days, and then
told Deiner to step down heavily.
- <i>It'; hopeless, ltel/ you.</i>
- That <i>may be,</i> but <i>Miklos</i> is <i>right.</i>
We gotta make the attempt.
All right. We'll try.
You once said the Prussian mind
is almost entirely predictable.
Now is there anyway offiguring out
what Schroder might be thinking?
- What he expects us to do next?
- Very interesting.
Then while he's one step behind,
planning on a countermove...
we could be executing
a counter-countermove.
Something like that.
With his knowledge of the radio
destroying all our hopes for rescue...
he'd then expect us to, uh,
fight amongst ourselves.
Yes, well, um,
we've done that, haven't we?
Then, he'd expect us
to completely change direction.
<i>Do something bold and daring.
Utterly foo/hardy.</i>
Something foolish, like- Like storming
the main gate, something like that.
Well, then we'll have to do it.
We don't want to disappoint him.
And while some of us
are diverting attention with that...
the rest of us will be
executing our real plan.
Yes, ifthere is a real plan.
There will be, as soon as we know
exactly where and when...
he intends to spring
his trap on the Seaview.
Anybody notice any
unusual construction recently?
Yeah, they-
They cleared the channel out.
South side of the island,
about two years ago.
They'd have to do that anyway,
to freight in their supplies.
<i>No. The supply boats dock at
the lagoon, on this side of the island.</i>
There might be something
to that channel.
They had me installing special
wiring there about four months ago.
Well, then all we have to do is find out
what that wiring sets in motion.
We'll have to send someone
out there to take a look.
It's impossible.
The guards would shoot any prisoner
outside the walls on sight.
The last time someone
went past the fence-
Schroder had him tortured for four days
as a lesson to the rest of us.
And then, when Schroder got tired
of his role as teacher, he had him killed.
<i>I'll go.</i>
There's a place behind the next hut
where I can get under the fence.
I checked it out. It's a blind spot.
The tower guards can't see it.
- How about your hands?
- <i>I'll</i> go under the fence.
I won't touch the barbed wire.
Thinkyou can find that channel?
I know that side of the island. They had me
out there cutting some timber a few months ago.
- I'll <i>find the channel</i>
- Good.
- When do you want me to go?
- Tonight, as soon as it's dark.
And be careful.
We don't want anything
to happen to the world's greatest athlete.
Good. Very good.
It's easy to see now how you won
all those marvelous Olympic medals.
Oh, don't worry.
After we've carried out our plans...
we will again
hold the Olympic games.
And you may command them,
for the Fourth Reich.
Thanks, I'd like that.
Hey, listen, about the, uh-
The guard. Yes.
It's unfortunate, but necessary.
Don't let it concern you.
Now, tell me. What do those
great minds in the hut think...
they are going to put over
on Colonel Alfried Schroder?
Nelson's forming a plan with two steps.
The first step is diversionary. Rush the gate.
The channel seems to end about here.
There's a hut on a rise above the channel.
I followed some of the wires as close as I could.
<i>But I was afraid
there'd be a guard post...</i>
<i>so I didn't get closer
than about 50 feet or so.</i>
I've been inside Schrodefs radio room.
He has enough equipment
to control anything on this island.
Brewster's right.
The controls are the key, and Schroder would
have those right in his headquarters building.
Now, think hard.
This, uh-
Has there been anything brought
to this island... so strange that...
<i>you must have thought that
Schroder had gone off the deep end?</i>
The nets!
Months ago...
I-I was on a work crew,
unloading supplies.
<i>And the cargo was huge steel nets.</i>
- Submarine nets.
- I was wondering what kind offishing...
Schroder was going to use them for.
Controls are the key.
We've got to knock them out of action...
before he can close those
submarine nets over the Seaview.
Nelson, I think it's impossible.
We can't just walk out and tear apart
the headquarters with our bare hands.
We're not going to tear it apart.
We're gonna blow it apart.
Miklos, you're our expert
in that department.
What do we need to make explosives?
Well, if you ask me
about advanced nuclear fission...
I could probably give you
some kind ofan answer.
But a plain little bomb?
It's too simple.
I've never... given it any thought.
Well, it's all exploding energy.
The basic principle must be the same.
To a large degree.
First, we'll need some kind
of a covering or shell...
to contain the energy and then
release it all in one explosive burst.
- How about dried mud? Clay?
-Yes.
Something like that. Then we'll need
some kind of electrical charge.
- <i>Something t0 detonate it.</i>
- <i>Oh, don't you worry.</i> I'll <i>get you</i> a spark.
As for the explosive itself,
we'll need a base...
ofammonium nitrate
or sodium nitrate.
<i>And how much force
would this explosive release?</i>
The explosive force will be
more than sufficient for your needs.
Fine. Reinhardt, you get some mud.
Brewster, start working
on the detonators.
<i>The Seaview has stopped.</i>
- How faraway?
- Not more than halfa mile.
Mm-hmm.
Captain Crane is a good officer.
As every good officer knows, he has to
first carefully reconnoiter unknown terrain.
He will send out skin divers,
who will scout the island...
and they will report that the lagoon
approach is much too heavily fortified.
Then, of course, he will come
in on the only other approach...
the south side of the island.
- And into the channel.
- Yes.
We went to so much trouble
building it, it seems only right...
that Captain Crane should use it.
The only other approach would be here,
along the south end of the island.
- Chip, are you sure about the lagoon?
- It's too shallow for us.
Without looking hard, I counted four
gun emplacements on the cliffs above it.
They've got every inch of that lagoon zeroed in,
just waiting for unexpected callers like us.
- We could blast our way in.
- No, no.
The admiral wouldn't stand a chance.
We'd better slip in quietly.
Now, the reefs block us east and west.
Okay. I guess that just leaves
the south side approach. That's it.
There you are, Admiral.
Your own private arsenal.
Nobel himselfcouldn't have
made better explosives for you.
Well, we'll just have to see that
they get very special delivery.
Everything's quiet out there. Schroder is
nowhere around, no lights on in his quarters.
Now, I'd guess that the <i>Seaview</i>
will move in just as dawn breaks.
- We'll have to act right now.
- That's right. Everybody got a bomb?
- Yeah.
- Okay, one last check. After all,
we're going into battle.
Okay. Brewster.
You and Miklos and Reinhardt...
will have to create
as much diversion out front as you can.
Enough so Tomas and I
can get past the fence...
and circle around behind
the headquarters building.
I used to be a pretty good bowler at cricket.
lfl could just...
lob one of these through
their munition hut window-
It would make a very
pretty picture indeed.
One of us has got a good chance
of getting through. Whoever does...
blows that headquarters building apart.
- Right.
- Good luck.
There. That's the spot
the tower guards can't cover.
Good. We'll wait for the diversionary
fireworks. Should be any second now.
I'm afraid you're mistaken
once again, Admiral
<i>At this moment, your very clever companions
are being rounded up in the compound.</i>
- Quick! Over the fence.
- May I, please?
Thank you.
I must compliment you once more...
on your, uh, ingenuity.
What a very nice little bomb.
<i>Too bad it will not explode.</i>
Because a traitor sabotaged it.
<i>Don't be too harsh on Tomas.</i>
He is not as intellectually
secure as you and the others.
Therefore, he could not
withstand one of my persuasions.
<i>And therefore, he has joined
the winning side that much sooner.</i>
And besides, sabotage,
infiltration, traitors-
They're all perfectly
acceptable weapons ofwar.
- <i>Are/ft they?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>
Yes, I guess one has to expect that...
dealing with something like you.
I must now recommend that
you rejoin your companions.
You'll soon have company: the officers
and the crew of the <i>Seaview.</i>
You're worse than any of them.
Now, now, now.
Now, Admiral Nelson.
<i>That was a most unnecessary
and foolish thing to do.</i>
I keep expecting so much more from you.
Come, Tomas.
<i>I don't think you'll be very safe
in the compound from now on.</i>
<i>Besides, you've earned the right
to watch us spring the trap.</i>
Captain, there's a channel
opening up in front of us.
Let's get a look on visual.
Let's take her in as close as we can.
It's no use.
The Schroders of this world
will always be one step ahead of us.
Well, we've still got a chance.
You can't wish him and his plans away.
We've got a lot more
than wishing going for us.
Ifonly we don't run out of time.
The <i>Seaview</i> is moving into position.
Carl, switch the viewer on.
Viewer on.
Perfect!
No, no.
Let me do that.
Indicator light!
N ow! N ow!
And, that's-
That's all of it, Lee.
But how could you have figured Tomas?
I checked every foot
of that barbed-wire fence.
There wasn't an inch of it that wasn't
covered by one of the guard towers.
There's only one way that Tomas
could have gotten over that fence.
- IfSchroder wanted him to.
- Mm-hmm.
Once I was sure of that,
I knew that Tomas had sabotaged the bombs.
Aside from the one I repaired
after he'd finished working on it.
And switched with him.
Along with something else very special:
a timing device I made out of my wristwatch.
The doctor's just finished
his checkup on the passengers.
Mr. Miklos and Mr. Brewster
need some shots...
<i>and Dr. Reinhardfs blood pressure's
a little high-</i>
<i>otherwise, they're in pretty good shape,
considering Schroder's hospitality.</i>
I'm glad we didn't get
a taste of that hospitality.
<i>H' he'd have sprung those
steel nets on the Seamew“.</i>
we wouldn't have been able to maneuver.
He could have played
cat and mouse with us.
He could have played
cat and mouse with the whole world.
You mean,
whatever would have been left of it.
Yeah. Whatever would
have been left of it.
