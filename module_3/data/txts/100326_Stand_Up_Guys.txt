Yes, I could do with my cock it.
Well, that's why we're here.
- Just playing cool. - Sorry.
Remember when you broke that window at the hotel?
Yes!
Ran into one that had the cantina below.
I felt bad about this piece.
This definitely violates my parole rule.
Never mind, I want to get my prescription and the Nexioum so or else.

What's this?
Supposed to pick just one.

I do not think either myself.

- Doc are you here? - Yes.
I want to know if anything will happen to me, that's all.
I would like to know what will happen to me, I would like information.
Hirsch? Wait a minute.
She is the daughter of Hirsch.
Being the daughter of Hirsch? Kidding me?
Grown up so much.
- I remember you from when you were little. - Yes, the years pass.
Fucking die. Dying.
- What? - Fucking die.
- Dizzy so much. - Rest.
Take a deep breath.
Relax, you will not die. The doctor will be here in 2 minutes.
What does your father?
Emphysema is bad.
It's in the nursing home Lite HOUSE ...
since Mom died.
Does it.
When you were little, we did together.
I threw in the air.
-You were! -In was floating in the air.
In scream ...
remember?
I felt like I was floating. I remember that piano.
-Mercy! -Were you in jail, right?
-Yes. And so what?-What did you do?
I am compelled to respond.
I have blood in my brain anymore.
He was just unlucky.
This know-these. -Excuse me.
I want to take a quick look.
-How many pills he took?-A whole handful.
-Yes. -You are a true doctor?
You're a real patient?
Your penis is real?
Mr. Valentine, you have something called a hematoma.
Can you give anticoagulants for blood ...
but the old blood must be removed ...
to be able to flow into the new.
How to remove? Says What?
-To get ... -Okay, relax.
-Where are you going, Doc?-I'm leaving here.
I'll be in the waiting room.
Perhaps more fun than it should.
Maybe.
-I have no health insurance. -I pay them.
Who will do it, then?
-What? Know-how.
I do not know. -Let the quibbling.
I know ...
-Hey, Doc. -What's up, Alex?
Who is your friend?-It's my best friend ...
The ... Valentine. Just returned from a trip.
-How was your trip?-Just pleasure to be back.
I do not like Valentine. My friends call me Val.
Okay, then. Then I'll yell Val.
-Then we're friends. Yes, never arrive.
Yes, you're right.
Me and Doc are long time friends.
I remember the day I first squatted here.
-Really?-Course.
Sorry to ruin your recollection, but ...
little hungry. -What do you get tonight, guys?
Tea with lemon, please.
I want something heavier.
I want a beer.
And just how you want it, Val?
Bloody.
Comes immediately.
-It is always so sweet. -Every day when I leave out of here
I'm ... always better. -Really?
Who will do it, then?
I do not know.
-What about you, is not it?-I do not know.
You are. Come on. Say it. You are.
You think I will blame? Work is work.
If the roles were reversed I would do it in minutes.
Come on. Say you! -I am.
The Klapchents ...
has much malice in him. -We had underestimated.
The most evil and vindictive bastard.
It's the devil personified.
The first two years I was in ...
I was constantly alert.
I looked right, left ... I expected what would happen ...
And when it happens ...
We do the laundry, courtyard, cafe?
Just what I was thinking. And then I realized something.
It makes every day to serve my sentence.
So it would end like this.
How will you do then?
I will, when I sleep.
See?
This is not a very nice way. Come on.
What's this?
When we sleep.
How do you think we should do?
I think we should.
That is the issue.
He put his son to work.
This was not a good idea.
Okay, do not ask questions.
The first cloud ...
child panics and starts shooting.
He found me the ball during firefights.
It could be anyone.
There I was. I know.
It was an accident.
Where am I?
But I am responsible man and took responsibility.
For everyone.
-I know I did. -And with pressure.
And I did not say anything. Not a word.
And ...
Look ... you end up.
When I commissioned the work Klapchents?
The day ... that you entered.
For 28 years he had in hand?
Yes!
This is bullshit.
-Set your tea, Doc. -And the beer for you.
And the steak.
Alex ...
I must say ... that the nicest steak I've seen so far.
I can say, eh?-Is very polite.
-Are you okay, Doc?-Yes.
When will you do then?
By the morning.
This does not work. What time is it now?
1:17 a.m.
That I have other 9 hours.
-We go to the car. -Why not just walk?
I'd like to burn what I ate.
To digest.
Well ...
... What are my options now?
Can you shut up.
You will find me.
You might win but a little time.
But if you run away ...
No ... you have no friends.
True, but ...
... You could at least make a new beginning.
Best-so. -Really?
It is better because ...
I can 't say goodbye. -I do not want me goodbye.
What do you say? Must say goodbye.
There's nothing else to say.
Wait.
Appeared something. What?
What incredibly beautiful car that is!
No, Val!
I think he feels lonely and wants to draw a walk.
Appointment.
This car belongs to the brothers Tzargkoniou.
And you have to tell me something that?
No, but if you put with them ...
They earn your kidney and did not sell ch
I wish we had one wire ...
Can not be opened anymore car with wire, Val.
-Says who?-Car manufacturers.
What kind of asshole has one such car unlocked?
They are not afraid that they would steal the car.
Better to begin.
Come on.
I tell you that these guys ...
They left the key idiots.
Where in the hell is the key?
Not a good idea, Val.
My life is full of bad ideas.
You know how you put forth?
The cars are different today.
Yes!
So do you know?
Press the brake and pushed the button.
That.
Where to get me!
Where are we going?
Where do you think?
Our friend.
I do not want to end up in such a home.
Excuse me. Do you know where is the room of Hirsch?
I like the Hirsch. Are you friends?
Yeah, dude.
The room is ...
... The end of runway left.
Thank you.
-You came to save him?-How do you know?
I wish someone would come to rescue me.
All this hope.
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
I am dreaming. You're still here!
We are all here! Like the good old days!
Well?
Come get out of here!
Get me out of here.
Expect to get some air.
Let's run away.
-You want to get together? 'No, let's go.
Better get dressed.
The sweet taste of freedom.
We have a car?
That.
This.
You will drive it.
-Not legroom. -And here is closely behind.
Forget the leg room! I'm taller. Go!
The situation is not ideal.
-You're authority. -I.
-You. -I.
-These are not forgotten. -You're authority, Hirsch.
Four minutes before you expect to die ...
and now sit in this incredible car.
The situation is fine.
You're right. Give me the key.
-There is no key. -Stop the workup. Give it to me
-It button. -It's automatic.
-Where? Here?-Yes.
Along with the brake.
Can we go now?
Have millions of numbers here. I have not seen anything like it.
As if we are the future.
Very nice!
Well, Hirsch ...
What did you do ... since the last time I saw you?
In longer bereaved.
Yeah, me too.
Otherwise, I guess.
I'm sorry for your loss. Sorry about Julia.
Yes, but suffered much.
What to say?-Your own health is how?
I took something a few months ago.
What turned out?
I do not know. I did not ask because I do not concern me.
But now I'm more air. More aerodynamic.
Whither the highway?
No, from the highway, Hirsch.
-I will not ask again. -Go left.
Turn left, young man! Left!
-I learned gardening. -In prison?
-Yes. -It was Julia's weakness.
I have planted many bushes, my friends.
Does not surprise me.
You know what I did when I came out?
Committed offense to get back to see what happens.
And you probably had the weakness.
I had? Probably still have it.
What
-Do not worry. We will lose. -Today I got my suspension.
I am in a stolen car ...
I imagine that you carry a gun.
Carries.
Well?
I've been depressed ... so let's do it!
Two!
I see.
Remember that day in the crock with the Chinese?
Yes!
I think we should do it again.
Hirsch ... very good driving incidentally.
Have you yet, buddy. -I have it, is not it?
-Completely. -It was intense.
Puke in my mouth.
When they came out, Val?
Today.
-Fuck out of here. Yes, ask the Doc.
Are you kidding me. Freed the same day.
Glad to share your experience.
28 years.
28 years, damn. Served his punishment like a man you, Val.
Stayed upright. -And you would do the same.
-So I want to believe. -It's possible, but ...
You did ... you, Val. -This is true.
I can not believe ...
That will not work ... so long.
No, that after parted our ways.
You can not forgive yourself ...
and therefore should pay for everyone else?
What will you do now that you came, Val?
I always wanted to finish high school.
To learn more about the people ...
You, Hirsch?
There is something in this life that you have not?
And would you want to do?-Two girls simultaneously.
-This is, well, Doc. -Say that it has become.
Spin so fast?
Once again and will treat you to coffee.
Wendy, let me know our partner, Richard Hirsch.
What's up
Hello there.
He wants to make a trio.
Damn it!
This only works Oksana.
Irina fell from the stairs.
You?
I?
No ...
do not do it for the money. -I will not pay.
Sorry ... how to say?
Wendy.
Can you guarantee that you will live ...
the best experience of your life.
-Promise?-I swear to God.
Okay, but would cost triple.
-Should be double. -Indeed.
So if you want ...
Oksana!
Be good with girls.
If not watched, would not believe it.
Put it in the vacuum cleaner.
He said every day no matter what he did ..
put it in the vacuum cleaner.
How do you say what ... -Whirlpool.
But it is to collect dust ...
from corners. Why not put your dick ...
It does not matter, because magnified his dick.
And continued to grow. -There are other ways.
I heard something from China. A container for bees.
They put in and the bees sting your dick.
-What are you talking about! -Swell. Is enormous.
Yes, but where do you put it?
I do not know. But the whole thing worthwhile.
I do not seem logical.
The Hirsch is too long inside.
Henchman.
There he is!
Well?
Still operates the pump?-You could say so.
Enough.
I do not know the English word for what I feel.
Surprise?
I think you are looking for something else.
Affection. This is close enough.
-I did not know you have it. -Got it.
Hirsch ...
-It's like chewing gum advertising. -You are the best of all.
Never mind. You'll get over it.
Call me. Thank you.
Who would He told you that bichtis!
You must feel great! -Would not I told you so.
Why
I have xanakeratosei my wife. I feel awful.
Mercy, Hirsch! It's dead for centuries!
We were married 40 years! Not surpass five minutes.
Cut!
We do not chase the cops. -Adrenaline by leads.
If you quit, you get him to sleep.
What was that?
-We were?-What was that?
Get! Someone's in the boot pagkaz.
To-do in the end. -Do not do it. Not good.
Sounds like a man.
On three, okay?
A ...
Two ...
Three!
Pull the scarf.
Geez! Who leads?-I.
-How did you get in here?-Make holiday.
-What does this mean?-Get me out of here!
Who are you?
My friends?-Listen, Hirsch ...
You should give me your pants.
-Why-You need something to wear.
I will not give my pants. Finally.
Not wearing clothes. Give me your pants!
Give yours! -The mine did not give it.
I gave her my jacket. My pants are important.
Who are you to decide ...
what pants are important and which are not?
I do not need. Sit and drive.
What to do? I go out! Come!
She did not give my pants. Finally!
This is your last offer?
I do not make deals.
Okay, Plan B. Doc!
How are you? Did you sell women's clothes?
We seem to sell?
My friend did you a polite question.
Can you give a polite reply?
You do not hear well, old man, or do you just stupid?
In-form to find. -Really?
I think I nodded my hips well.
No, you did very nicely.
Thank you.
A fine.
I think we need to learn some things.
Coming.
To see. Her clothes do.
-Do you feel better? Bit. I'm hungry too.
Sylvia, why not continue from where it stopped?
I was on the sidewalk and waited for the taxi.
He stops the car. Nice car, nice smile ...
asked me if I want to fly somewhere though.
I was late and I accepted.
You know that you should not enter into strangers cars.
Fuck you, okay?
"Fuck you!" I like this girl.
It was also another in the back seat, which I did not see.
Tied me and took me to a warehouse.
And two others were there, laughing ...
anyway.
Soon I was naked and ...
the rest I think.
That had not been seen before?
Never.
You think I got myself in the boot pagkaz?
-What are you doing here?-Well. Thank you, Alex.
I did not know that you have so many friends, Doc.
Neither do I.
-Tell me if you need anything. -Okay. Thank you.
Finally, however, I fainted for a while ...
I woke up naked in the trunk of the car pagkaz.
And now I sit with you wearing Korean clothes.
I had a dog who yelled Sylvia. "
Love it and I think every day ...
There is so much I want to forget.
-Where was the store?-Show me where you got the car ...
and I'll show you. -Steal.
The street that belongs to the brothers Tzargkoniou ...
completely illegal and unscrupulous ...
Animals.
We have to do something with this.
What you want to do, then?
What will dissolve them with screwdrivers?
It's only the beginning.
Get!
What are you?-What do you think?
-Baby! I missed you. -Mr Hirsch ...
Remember me? I do this ...
-What time is it?-I do not know. What time is it
It's time to cut ass and ...
to chew gum. And you know what?
I finished chewing gum.
It's like the good old days, right?
-No. Better. -Yes. Why
Because this time we can appreciate.
Yeah, right. This is why.
See you soon.
I'll be right.
You'll see the place ...
will show us what it is and then we'll go.
We are three people who walk. Nothing suspicious.
That's it.
There in the corner.
-You must leave now, Sylvia. No, I want to see.
No, sweetie. Nobody sees our work.
It may also be 5-6 guys in there ...
and we are both. Can not develop as hoped.
And so what? I can help.
-Go home. Sleep. -No!
We can not get to us.
-I do not think listening. -Seems determined.
-There will be gone. -Listen, sweetie ...
why not wait 10 minutes here ...
and then enter?
Why are you doing this to me?
I do not understand the question.
I do not know n
This is true, but ...
I know. The same time.
With this disgusting, they did. -Are animals.
-There must be consequences. -Exactly.
They believe that they can do such in others.
and escape. Well ...
will suffer the consequences.
And now my next trick ...
Give me the screwdrivers.
Rather it is open.
You're right.
Hi, guys. What's up
How did you get in here?
-We are friends of Sylvia. On-remember?
Naked girl that you put in the boot pagkaz.
What do you know ...
Anybody else no ball?
Remember, filaria ...
what you sow, reap.
Yes, I would like to mention a large shipment of weapons and drugs.
What is the address here?-Rodney Street.
This I know. But what number?
What is the number here?
I asked something. -Fuck you!
I heard the number.
172.
Rodney 172. Thank you. Have a good evening.
We do not wish for your enemies.
See who came ...
Damn it!
Good evening, gentlemen.
Remember it?
Your turn ...
I guess it's time to get out.
The stage is yours.
8 minutes to go before the cops arrive.
Thanks. -Please.
Well, guys ... have a good time.
Like ballet, is not it?
"The Nutcracker" is my favorite.
Here, take your gun.
I have blood on my jacket.
You can wash it.
We put these organic and will come immediately.
What are these organic?-I tell you that will come immediately.
This does not come as often and wash.
The blood is left over. You can not remove it.
You buy a new suit.
Newly-suit?-Yes.
This is another discussion.
What is happening here?
What's this?
Always the most appropriate time.
However it was his last wish.
Be worked in the past.
Yes, worked in the past.
Ended.
I think we should bury him.
Do you know where Nina Hirsch works?
I think there is.
Nina ...
Us ... remember?-Course.
-How is the area?-Fine.
Listen ...
... Your father is dead.
What
Sorry too.
-Do you know where?-We got him for a ride ...
and died.
Where is it?
It's out in the driver's seat of a stolen car.
See?
It's still warm.
With less than 30 minutes.
-What did you do?-Passed well as old.
I've enjoyed my stay.
There is a family tomb.
We want to bury.
Want to bury him now?
Tonight?
For us to be done tonight.
Here you go, sir.
Give Hirsch.
Here you go, boy.
I think Hirsch is happy to be next to your mother.
Buy this grave when I was 4 years old.
He said ...
"Honey, can you come to see me sometimes.
Telling me the news. "
Dad ...
everything is going well.
You taught me that ...
the best you can do ...
one man is to be useful.
You me you were so helpful.
Forever.
Should we say something.
Would you do it?'m Not good at them.
Yes!
Okay, I can do it.
The Hirsch was a good friend.
I remember once ...
who stole a shop.
And ...
Pressed a ... dog.
Cried two days for this dog.
Anyway, I miss ...
many of us who stayed behind.
Was witness of our lives.
There were many of us.
Perhaps he was the last man on the planet ...
who knew our names ...
he remembered our childhood.
That ... shared ...
every moment of the past.
They say die twice ...
a time when we let our last breath and another
when the last person that we know, says our name.
And then ...
Hirsch's life will be forgotten.
Like everyone else poor ...
who had the glory to live.
Amen.
What?-Nothing. It was very nice.
Be nice?
The best I have heard.
-Seriously?-Very good, Val.
Fuck you!
-Thank you, Valentine. -There was nothing ...
No, Valentine. Listen to me.
Thank you.
Good night.
There's nothing to say.
Well ...
the funeral will tell me?
The work.
How much time I have left?
Four hours.
I want a steak.
-You hungry?-Yes.
-To eat breakfast. -You will get a new suit.
Then you shoot me in the head ...
for not to get the suit you.
Exactly. I'll shoot you in the head.
-Thank you. -Please.
Look to see. My car is still here.
I wonder?
Who would want this crock?
-Good morning, folks. -Hey, Alex.
How and woke up so early?
And why are you so dirty?
We did a little gardening. Late in the evening.
You should try it sometime.
And you, my young?'m Not done yet?
I like to sleep when waking the others.
Give me a feeling ... - ... Vitality.
-Yes. -I know how you feel. Trust me.
All right. What do you get then?
-Two eggs Mela. -Of course.
I want a steak, a Greek omelette ...
a Greek salad, a banana juice ...
and even a steak.
And a coffee and a muffin.
I see.
Being very hungry, Val.
I'm leaving on a long trip.
Just when we started to know each other.
Yeah, too bad.
The brew immediately.
I'll make a crazy assumption now ...
Alex, the waitress is your granddaughter.
Yes!
-You must tell her. -I will.
Really?
Why did not you tell by now?
-I. Why?
You can.
Trust me.
The truth will be in release. -OK, but not today.
-When then?-Tomorrow.
Tomorrow? Promise?
Tomorrow will tell you everything.
Okay, then. Tomorrow.
My last meal.
Yes!
Do not be emotional now.
Thank you.
-Val ... -Alex ...
Do you mind if I sit down?
No. Please.
Doc comes here every morning ...
orders and always the same.
The force of habit.
-I am. -Done?
How is it?
I always have the same question for my clients, but ...
him more. I do not know.
How do you imagine him?
Please ...
I ask for mercy. Only this.
I know that I was the only child ...
"Please?"
Please, bring back my child!
To see how far they go in the supplications!
The <i> our mercy is over! </ i>
Why
Will die sooner or later. Just give it two more years.
What is the difference, damn it?
What does Alex chaliamoutra?
What
You know what I mean. I'm sure ...
to see that this time.
It would be a shame such a young girl ...
leave a terrible accident.
Too bad, eh?
- We did. - Really?
Are you sure?
He is a man who knows he is being alone.
To live a life full of regrets.
And it can not come here every day just to be close to others.
Even if it's for half an hour. Just being among people.
That is correct.
Sometimes what we imagine, and people are different things.
Sometimes it is the same though. Exactly the same.
Yes!
That and I think.
Finished your work, otherwise it may happen and accidents.
Your food is ready,
I wish I could speak another and Val.
And me, I enjoyed talking to you.
Yes I did.
- The Church is open? - The Church is always open.
Yes!
You or I start? I've forgotten.
- You start. - I Okay go.
Well ...
... Father forgive me that I have sinned.
When he confessed last time?
60 years at approx.
Okay, now Confess me any serious
sin, which in turned from the path of God.
It will take years.
Father, we can not sit on what I did today?
So far, one shot in the knee
and another one on his shoulder.
Stole prescription drugs and a dope car.
Varesa a Korean citizen clothes in person and experience the clothes.
And fuck a Russian prostitute four times.
All of these have you done today?
Since yesterday afternoon. But I did something good stuff.
I buried a friend.
Help a young woman get back her life.
And soften the pain of my best friend.
And for 28 years, I kept my mouth shut.
So, I can say one Our Father and be done?
No, I do not think the Lord's Prayer will help.
You're right, you're right I think.
Wasting both our our time.
