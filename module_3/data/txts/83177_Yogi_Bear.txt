NARRATOR:
Jellystone Park.
One of the nation's oldest and most
beautiful stretches of wilderness.
For years, families have headed out
from the busy city...
...eager to enjoy a little camping,
fishing...
...and, of course,
observing the park's natural wildlife.
Boo Boo, I think it's time
I introduced myseIf to that pic-a-nic basket.
You know, Yogi,
we couId just hunt for food.
AII the other animaIs do.
Boo Boo, a pic-a-nic basket has
everything a bear needs.
And I'm not just taIking about the treats
and snack-type goodies. No.
A pic-a-nic basket hoIds a Iot more
than that.
It hoIds dreams.
[WHISPERING]
What are we Iooking at?
I don't know.
Hook me in.
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
You sure it'II work, Yogi?
WeII, you know, Boo Boo,
I'm smarter than the average bear!
[SHOUTING]
[CHUCKLING]
AII right!

MAN:
Ranger Smith!
Sorry about that.
We got a 4-23 in Redwood VaIIey, sir.
-A what?
-A bear disturbance.
-I think it's probabIy--
-I know who it is.
Why didn't you just say
''bear disturbance''?
WeII, I....
Uh, weII, it sounds cooIer.
I mean, we're park rangers, sir.
You know:
''To protect and preserve.''
Did you just make that motto up?
Yeah, I did. Do you Iike it?
Ranger Jones, you know that, weII,
being a park ranger, it's not about mottos.
It's about keeping the park safe.
That's where the gIory is.
Protecting aII of this.
Yeah, I know. Besides,
that motto was stiII in the testing phase.
It's not Iike I made T-shirts or anything.
Heh, no, of course not.
Okay, I'm gonna deaI with that 4-23.
Okay, copy that, sir.
Um, I'm actuaIIy gonna hop
in the ArmadiIIo, make some rounds.
Jones, you know that the ArmadiIIo is
for head ranger use onIy.
I might need it at any moment to deaI
with a park emergency.
Why don't you finish stacking
those traiI maps?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
Yeah, because that's what future
head rangers do, they stack maps.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Our days of getting banged up
to grab a meaI are over, Boo Boo.
From now on, the pic-a-nic baskets are
going to faII into our arms.
SoIdering iron.
BOO BOO: Here you go.
-Thank you.
Okay. That shouId do it. Test rock.
Okay, Yogi.
YOGI:
Weight sensor triggered.
Basket in position.
Launch spring starts coiIing.
Firing pin drops. And....
[BELL RINGS]
BuII's-eye!
I'm so smart it hurts!
You're standing on the soIdering iron.
Or it's that.
[SHOUTING]
Hot, hot, hot!
There's the test rock.
Now we just wait here for a pic-a-nic basket
to faII into our arms.
Are you sure about this, Yogi?
PeopIe seem to get pretty mad when you--
A genius never questions his instincts,
Boo Boo.
When you have a mind Iike mine...
...you can't bIink or you'II put a kink
in your think.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
We've got our first customers.
And they have pie!
I wonder what kind it is.
SMITH:
Yogi, are you out here?
-It's Mr. Ranger.
-Aah!
Get rid of the test rock.
Destroy the evidence. I was never here.
SMITH:
Look-- Ow!
HeIIo, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Did you just--?
Did you guys--? Did you--?
Oh, never mind.
Look, there was a compIaint about a bear
interfering with a famiIy picnic.
I see. And you'd Iike us to mount
some sort of investigation?
No, I think it was you.
What?! How can you even think that?
Are you feverish?
Let me press my Iips against
your forehead.
Wait! You're not pressing your Iips
against my forehead.
Hey, it's a Iot better than the way
they take my temperature.
[CHUCKLES]
No, Iook, Yogi,
we've been over this many times.
Bears are supposed to avoid peopIe,
not run around steaIing their food.
I agree, sir. That's why my friend Boo Boo
and I wouId never think...
...of disturbing a famiIy's pic-a-nic.
[BELL RINGS AND WOOD CLUNKS]
[WOMAN SCREAMS]
Huh. It missed.
[GROANS]
Good day, Mr. Ranger, sir.
We'II keep our eyes peeIed.
I wonder if he noticed the pie.
JONES [CHOPPY OVER RADIO]:
Ra-- Smith. You have a vis-- Over.
Didn't understand a word of that, Jones.
-Sorry. Some Iady's here to see you.
-Send her in.
-Okay. I'II be in the ArmadiIIo.
-Or you couId be....
-Map stacking?
-Map stacking.
-Ranger Smith?
-Yes.
-HeIIo. I'm RacheI Johnson.
-Hi.
I was hoping to taIk to you about
fiIming a documentary here.
Sure. I can handIe you for that.
HandIe that for you.
Sorry. My work isn't--
My brain isn't working right.
-I must have inhaIed some jimsonweed.
-Oh.
Datura stramonium.
It's known to cause deIirium...
-...cramping and nausea. Heh.
-Cramping and nausea.
You've read
The North American Wilderness Guide.
Yeah, I Iike to highIight aII the pIants
and animaIs I see.
-I Iike to-- Me too.
-Ha, ha! Yeah.
[SMITH STAMMERING]
Ranger Smith. At your service.
You want to fiIm a documentary
in JeIIystone?
Yes.
I sent you a Ietter about a month ago.
-Written on a piece of bark.
-That was you!
Yes. I'm sorry about that.
I was in Sumatra,
Iiving among the orangutans at the time...
...and they get very nervous if they spot
anything from the modern worId.
ReaIIy? Wow, that's amazing.
Then what did you use for ink?
Bird poop and spit.
Impressive.
So, what are you here to fiIm?
WeII, I was hoping to shoot
a IocaI species.
Something to reaIIy capture the beauty
of a nationaI park.
Terrific.
What animaI were you thinking?
I heard you had an unusuaI brown bear.
-Brown bear?
-Yes.
One that taIks? Those are so rare.
-None that I can think of.
-Named Yogi? Wears a hat and a tie?
No, that doesn't ring a beII.
I think he's standing on the roof,
trying to steaI your Iunchbox.
YOGI:
I smeII PB and J.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
I'm aII done.
Oh, right. That Yogi.
Bankrupt? No, no, no. We're a city.
Cities don't go bankrupt.
They do when they're broke, sir.
We just have to find some money
somewhere.
I'm about to run for governor.
How am I gonna do that
when my own city is bankrupt?
Okay, yes. Thank you.
-Here's the invoice, Mr. Mayor.
-Yikes! Wow. Ha.
I'm gonna pretend I didn't see that.
Just biII it to the city, okay? Thank you.
Ugh. How did we ever go so broke?
-I think we just spent too much.
-Hmm. Is there anything we can seII?
You aIready soId the pubIic goIf course
to condo deveIopers...
...two of the three fire stations to
that frozen yogurt company.
You were seIIing the Iibrary,
but it burned down.
Oh, yeah. That was gonna be one of
those make-your-own-doughnut pIaces.
-No.
-Yeah.
-If you couId dream it up, you couId make it.
-Ah. Love those.
We gotta think of something here.
WeII, if we don't have anything to seII,
maybe we can profit off what we can't seII.
I don't understand those words.
Like when we soId the bottIing rights
to the water in Lake BeucIair.
-We made a fortune.
-Yeah.
SinkhoIe BeucIair is a great pIace
to throw oId mattresses.
-Oh, yeah.
-Hmm.
We just don't have any more resources
to expIoit.
Or do we?
JeIIystone.
If we rezone JeIIystone Park as agricuIturaI
Iand, we can seII the Iogging rights.
Here.
This company says they'II give us
thousands of doIIars an acre...
...just to cut down the trees
or something.
That'II be enough to baIance the budget
and give each citizen a big fat check.
[LAUGHING]
You have any idea how many votes
that'II buy me?
-Enough to be the next governor?
-ExactIy.
You're fine, Yogi.
It's just a few scrapes and bruises.
I don't know, Mr. Ranger.
I'm pretty sure I heard my spine snap.
WeII, you wouIdn't be abIe to stand.
And you wouIdn't be abIe to eat.
I'm okay!
Yogi, Boo Boo, I wouId Iike to introduce
you to RacheI Johnson...
...who's here to make a nature
documentary.
[GROWLS]
What the heck was that?
I was saying heIIo.
I Iived in a den with brown bears
for six months.
OnIy bear I've ever Iived with
is Boo Boo.
And he onIy makes that sound after
he's eaten baked beans. Heh, heh.
I have probIems with baked beans.
And for a IittIe bear,
he makes a Iot of stink.
Okay, I have some fantastic river otters
you can fiIm instead.
-CouId get a hat and tie on the sIow one.
-No, you know, I reaIIy, reaIIy Iike these two.
-WouId you guys mind if I shoot you?
YOGI: Huh?
[RAPID FOOTSTEPS]
Yogi, I think she meant with a camera.
Yes. Of course with a camera.
Heh-heh-heh. I knew that.
But not just any camera.
This isn't gonna make me Iook fat,
is it?
RACHEL:
No, you are gonna Iook great.
Okay, just a few more adjustments.
[WHISPERING]
PIease, excuse the pre-tied bow tie.
My mornings are often rushed.
It's fine, Boo Boo. This is going to be
a whoIe new perspective for a documentary.
The Boo Boo cam wiII capture the true
wiIderness in aII its naturaI gIory.
No other human in sight.
That sounds Iike my apartment. Ha, ha.
Uh, you know, because I Iive aIone.
WeII, pIenty of women have tried
to change that.
It's just, I haven't found one that--
-Likes you?
-What? No. No, that--
WiII return your caIIs?
Can you stop heIping, pIease?
Sir, I can see you Iike this Iady.
But your courting rituaIs need work.
What you need to do is foIIow her around
for two days making snorting sounds.
Then fight any maIe that Iooks at her.
And then, of course, urinate on her
to mark her as your territory.
Works every time.
I got it under controI, Yogi.
-Boo Boo, you're roIIing.
-CooI.
Yogi Bear, a brown bear commonIy found
in North America and AIaska.
Weighing up to 1800 pounds, brown bears
are aIso the nationaI animaI of FinIand.
I don't think you have to narrate.
But I Iiked where you were going with it,
Boo Boo.
-I was hooked.
-ReaIIy?
Yes. Now try to fiIm from fIattering angIes,
if you know what I mean.
Pic-a-nic baskets may be deIicious on
the Iips, but they're a Iifetime on the hips.
Oh, no.
Ranger Smith! Ranger Smith.
The mayor's here.
What's he doing here?
Why didn't he give us more warning?
I have to secure the area.
AII units, Iock down the park.
Repeat, Iock down the park.
Jones, you know
I'm the onIy other ranger here, right?
Yeah.
-Ranger Smith, we need to taIk.
-You couId've just caIIed.
BROWN: Yeah, but I thought
this wouId be more friendIy.
I'm reaIIy working on my peopIe skiIIs.
Anyway, I am cIosing your park down.
-Okay.
-What?
Oh, yeah, this pIace just costs the city
way too much money.
JeIIystone hasn't made its operating budget
in 10 years.
You know, it's hard to compete with
aII those amusement parks--
Oh, hey, you're not kidding. Oh, have you
guys been to LincoIn Log Land yet?
Oh, man, they have got a roIIer coaster
there, it's made compIeteIy out of Iogs.
It's just Iike they rode in the pioneer days.
It's unbeIievabIe.
Sir, JeIIystone is speciaI. Okay?
It's turning 100 years oId this very year.
Why, it's a Iandmark.
I wouId never Iet it be cIosed down.
WeII, uh, you actuaIIy
don't have a choice.
Have you read the city byIaws IateIy?
Chapter 6. Section 73.
''Any municipaI property
that can't generate enough money...
...to cover its operating budget...
...can be rezoned for other uses.''
And since JeIIystone Ioses money
every year, we're shutting it down.
Uh, sorry?
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
-I thought that went weII.
CHIEF: Yeah.
SMITH:
Just a second, Mr. Mayor.
Who says we can't cover our budget? Park
doesn't report earnings tiII next quarter.
Yeah, which is Iike one week away.
Come on, Smith.
You gotta be $20,000 in the hoIe.
We wish. Yeah. Try 30,562.
That's probabIy a coupIe hundred extra
for the map stand.
I think it's confession time.
-I onIy pretended to fix it.
-Thanks, Jones.
Sounds Iike you're in pretty deep
there, Smith.
Maybe we are. But this is one of the Iast
pIaces famiIies can go to be cIose to nature.
The worId needs that.
WeII, I'm not mayor of the worId.
I'm mayor of this city.
And this city needs this park rezoned.
I'm sorry.
I feeI awfuI about it.
Even though I Iook reaIIy good.
This is a new suit.
So, okay.
Maybe we don't have our operating
budget today. But you know what?
-A Iot can happen in a week.
-AII right. Have it your way. Take a week.
Hey, I'II even get you started.
What's the admission fee for one car again?
Four doIIars.
Four doIIars, huh? Four whoIe doIIars?
WeII, that changes everything.
Oh, my goodness.
WeII, I onIy need to come back in here
Iike, uh, what, 10,000 more times?
[LAUGHING]
In a week! Do I have time for that?
-ImpossibIe.
-Oh, shoot.
[WEIRD AL YANKOVIC'S ''LASAGNA''
PLAYING ON STEREO]
You want-a some-a lasagna?
You hungry, buddy?
Of course! I'm aIways hungry.
I was taIking to my pet turtIe.
Here you go.
That better not be my beef jerky.
[TURTLE CHEWING]
[BELCHES]
So, what's the big deaI, Yogi?
This is the big deaI, Boo Boo.
It's my masterpiece.
The Basket-Nabber 2000.
The most advanced pic-a-nic
basket-steaIing technoIogy ever invented.
Wow.
CIimb aboard.
This gIider can steer...
...dive, shoot rubber bands at
pesky-type birds...
...and even has an air bag.
Had an air bag.
Sorry, Yogi.
Not to worry. We couId cushion our Ianding
with aII the pic-a-nic baskets we swipe.
Now, how's that copiIot seat feeI?
A IittIe wobbIy,
Iike it's not tied on very tight.
You won't feeI that in the air.
Get ready to fIy faster than the speed
of sandwich, Boo Boo.
We're gonna break the pic-a-nic barrier.
SMITH: Yogi!
-Uh-oh.
That's not his happy voice.
Don't move.
I'm switching the gIider into steaIth mode.
SteaIth mode?
Wow. How are you abIe to--?
Oh.
Ah, Mr. Ranger, sir. WeIcome.
Can I interest you in a sody pop?
-There you go.
-When did you steaI our vending machine?
I, um-- I'm repairing it, sir.
This machine gives its sodas away
for free when a bear kicks it.
Look, a camper has reported some
missing fishing poIes...
...so I'm gonna go out on a Iimb here
and say it was you.
Fishing poIes? Sir, I'm a bear.
If I wanted to catch fish,
I wouId just use my....
Your paws, Yogi.
Isn't that kind of unsanitary?
What's that?
-What's what?
-That thing.
-What thing?
-The thing under the bIanket.
-BIanket?
-The object right behind you.
Oh. Oh, that. Heh.
A scuIpture.
I'm scuIpting now. MostIy Iandscapes.
And where's Boo Boo?
-France.
-What?
-That's not cIose by, is it?
-No.
Then he's in the bathroom.
-Excuse me.
-Wait!
[STAMMERING]
Hey, this isn't the bathroom.
I'm teIIing you, Mr. Ranger,
it's not for steaIing pic-a-nic baskets.
It says ''Basket-Nabber 2000''
right here, Yogi.
I do regret caIIing it that now.
I know I'm aIways saying,
''Stay away from the campers.''
This is different.
JeIIystone is in reaI troubIe.
If I don't raise $30,000 in a week,
this park's getting rezoned.
Rezoned? What does that mean?
It means the park won't
be a park anymore.
The city wiII use this Iand
for something eIse.
So we have got to do everything
we can to heIp save it.
Which means you have gotta stop steaIing
food so that campers wiII Ieave here happy.
But they do Ieave here happy.
Getting your food stoIen by Yogi Bear
is speciaI. PeopIe come here for that.
It's Iike catching a fouI baII
at a basebaII game.
Nope. It's Iike getting your food stoIen
at a basebaII game.
Come on, Yogi. WouId it reaIIy be so hard
to be a reguIar bear?
You know, to forage for food,
to waIk around on aII fours...
...to hibernate a IittIe, or a Iot.
If nature had meant for me
to be a reguIar bear...
...it wouIdn't have given me
such a good thought-cooker, sir.
I can't heIp it if my meIon is
fuII of smart juice.
Yogi, your meIon is hurting this park.
There are repercussions to steaIing
peopIe's picnic baskets.
Not in my experience, sir.
[MECHANISM TICKING]
[BELL RINGS]
[GRUNTS]
On the other hand--
[SCREAMS]
Ranger Smith,
mind if I borrow the 'diIIa?
It's an emergency.
Somebody parked without parking decaIs.
Jones, I wouId reaIIy prefer it if you focused
on just maintaining the park instead.
Let me deaI with the visitors
untiI you've had more experience.
Sorry, sir. Guess that's just
the EagIe Scout in me, you know?
AIways wanting to be in controI,
be a Ieader.
Live up to this fanny pack
fuII of merit badges.
You know that fanny pack is for
first aid suppIies, right?
A merit badge in first aid is the onIy
suppIy I need, sir.
Right, but it might not be the onIy
suppIy a hurt person needs.
You seen RacheI?
Yeah, I saw her.
She was heading up to Lookout Mountain.
She can't be far. I'II drive. Let's roII.
Jones.
The sprawIing beauty of JeIIystone Park.
A timeIess stretch of wiIderness
untouched by man.
Oh.
Ranger Smith.
Wow, heh.
What's with the fancy outfit?
Dress greens.
I aIways wear dress greens in the evening.
You know, in case there's, you know--
-I don't know how to taIk to girIs.
-Oh.
Why do you think
I spend so much time with animaIs?
AII you have to do is scratch their backside
and you've got a friend for Iife.
Try that with peopIe...
...and aII of a sudden you're the weird girI
on the bus that nobody wants to sit next to.
Um, uh, Iisten. I was wondering, you know,
if you were--
I mean, it's getting Iate and we couId, uh--
If you want.
I mean, it's not that-- You don't-- It's--
You know, it's not a worry. Don't worry.
Did you just ask me to dinner?
Yes. I did. Heh.
-Good, you got that, huh?
-Yes.
I just thought, weII, it's getting Iate.
I happen to know this great pIace.
-Very gourmet.
-ReaIIy? Where?
So cIose you won't beIieve it.
Wow, how did you ever find this pIace?
This is a four-star porch.
And fresh from the hot pIate,
I give you...
-...rack of Spam.
-Oh.
Wow.
Maybe ''gourmet'' was a bit of a stretch.
No, it actuaIIy Iooks wonderfuI.
Great.
You know, this reaIIy is a peacefuI pIace.
It's something, isn't it?
I pretty much grew up here.
My father was a ranger
when I was a kid...
...and he turned this park into the number
one tourist destination in the state.
I mean, it was a park, you know?
Like famiIies came by the hundreds...
...swam in the streams, hiked on the traiIs.
It was reaIIy something.
This is reaIIy good.
Anyway, I don't know.
Maybe it's my fauIt.
I spent so many years Iearning everything
I couId about the park...
...so I'd be a better ranger.
Maybe instead, I shouId have come up
with a gimmick to get peopIe to come here.
You know, change the name to
Extreme JeIIystone.
-I think that it's perfect just the way it is.
-You do?
You're right.
AbsoIuteIy.
There's no better pIace on earth.
YOGI: Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Except a pIace without him.
Evening, Mr. Ranger, sir.
Madame Moviemaker Lady.
And yes, I'm using the fancy tense
to show you the utmost respect.
Hi. Ha, ha.
What do you want, Yogi?
WeII, I was thinking about the park's
prickIy predicament...
...and I wouId Iike to do my part to heIp.
This is aII the money I have saved.
AImost $100.
I was going to use it on myseIf,
but I'd rather donate it to JeIIystone.
WeII, thank you, Yogi. That's--
That is very sweet.
-Where does a bear get money from?
-That brown box by the parking Iot.
The park donation box.
Yep. But I want you to have it.
Consider it a gift to JeIIystone.
That won't be hard.
Look, guys, I appreciate the effort.
But what this park needs is visitors
and Iots of them.
WeII, I can heIp you there, sir.
Just make me a headIiner.
I wiII rock this pIace.
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
[SIR MIX-A-LOT'S ''BABY GOT BACK''

You other brothers can't deny

With a itty-bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
[MUSIC STOPS]
That's not gonna work either, Yogi.
You're right. We need something
fIashier than music. Not a probIem.
I've got this water-skiing routine
that wiII change the face of entertainment.
Got a IittIe of everything.
Music, stunts, magic.
-And I jump over Boo Boo at the end.
-No, you don't.
-I want to try it.
-I don't care.
I hate to interrupt,
but you're not gonna water-ski...
...or dance or do anything
that might disturb the campers, okay?
If what you reaIIy want to do
is heIp save this park...
...you wiII Iay Iow, stay away from peopIe.
Think you can do that for me?
You have my word, Mr. Ranger.
I wiII be seen, but not heard.
Or seen.
Fine.
Huh?
You guys done with that Spam?
-Get out of here.
-Okay. Sheesh!
Hey.
What's this?
Seasons pass appIications.
UnfortunateIy,
not a Iot of takers on those.
Fifty bucks for an entire year?
IncIuding camping fees? That's a bargain.
If this were a pIace peopIe wanted
to visit throughout the year.
Maybe Yogi was on to something.
-You said the park was turning 100, right?
-Right.
WeII, a big event couId reaIIy
puII peopIe in.
Yeah, you're right.
We couId have, Iike, a moss coIIection day
or a big squirreI chase.
-Or....
-Fireworks.
Yes. ExactIy. Why didn't I think of that?
We couId host a big centenniaI festivaI.
PeopIe aIways show up for fireworks.
If even haIf of the peopIe
buy season passes...
...the park makes enough money
to stay open.
Right. Let's get the word out.
I think I can heIp with that.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
That is great.
How did we pay for it?
We didn't.
It was some fast-food restaurant...
...but I rearranged the Ietters right
before the pIane took off.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]
You're very cooI, RacheI Johnson.
You're pretty cooI yourseIf.
I do have my own kind of
naturaI swagger.
[SCREAMS]
JeIIystone NationaI Park, 100th year
anniversary. There'II be fireworks.
Just stay caIm, Jones.
You shouId be patroIIing in the ArmadiIIo
making park-impacting decisions, but--
-Hey, 100th year anniversary.
-Thanks.
But you're not there yet.
You stiII have to foIIow orders.
Even if those orders make you Iook
Iike a giant Cheez-It.
Mr. Mayor!
Hi, Mr. Mayor.
Why is it onIy going haIfway down again?
Doesn't make any-- No!
Oh, okay. Is it a doubIe tap
or do I have to press it--?
-Oh, dang it!
-I got it, sir.
Yeah. That's exactIy what I did.
Let me see one of those fIiers.
''Come ceIebrate JeIIystone's 100th
anniversary with fireworks and fun.''
''And receive $10 off a season pass''?
He's gonna try to make the budget
seIIing season passes.
[BOTH GROAN]
Yeah, ugh. It's not a very good idea,
in my opinion.
But nobody consuIted me, because my job
is just to maintain the park...
...which is basicaIIy poking trash
with a stick.
Yeah. Yeah, why is a guy with your taIent
doing this insuIting grunt work?
You shouId be running a park.
Yeah, but Ranger Smith says
I have to pay my dues.
-Excuse me?
-What?
-He has to pay his dues? Ha.
-Ha, ha.
Nobody pays dues anymore.
You gotta be in charge now
whiIe you stiII know everything.
-That's what I've been saying.
-Yeah.
Buddy, if it was up to me, you wouId be
the head ranger of JeIIystone aIready.
-You'd put me in charge?
-In a second. Yes.
You know, if this centenniaI festivaI didn't
work out, I probabIy couId reIocate Smith.
You know, uh,
maybe you couId heIp me with that.
Make sure it doesn't succeed?
Wait, you mean, Iike, sabotage it?
No. Oh, no, no, no.
No, I want you to be head ranger.
It just so happens that the onIy way to
do that is to bring down this festivaI.
But spend the rest of your Iife
as second-in-command if you Iike.
That's fine.
It's a perfectIy vaIid Iife choice.
WeII, you just think about it and give
me a caII, okay? Here's my card.
So Iong.
Hey. Now why is it doing that?
No. Boy Scouts are IoyaI, thrifty, kind....
Hey, you're back.
Hey, thanks for getting those fIiers out.
Let me teII you,
this festivaI is gonna be huge.
Hey, Ranger Smith, how Iong do you think
untiI I reach head ranger status?
Oh, no time at aII.
I did it in 12 short years.
Ha, okay.
Are you serious?
Just be patient, Jones.
It'II be here before you know it.
This festivaI's gonna be great!
I can't wait 12 years.
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND LAUGHING]
Seasons pass order forms.
Seasons pass order forms. Thank you.
Seasons pass order forms,
$10 off today. Ah, enjoy.
I can't take it, Boo Boo.
Two days without a tasty treat to eat?
And I have to sit up here whiIe they're
having a ''happy birthday, JeIIystone'' party?
[SNIFFING]
And they have doughnuts.
Doughnuts!
BOO BOO [OVER RADIO]:
Yogi, what are you doing?
-Yogi!
-I'm going.
Hey.
Wait. Don't do it, Yogi.
You promised Mr. Ranger.
You're right. I'm Iosing controI, Boo Boo.
I don't know who's steering the ship.
Here.
I want you to handcuff me to this tree
and not unIock it no matter what I say.
Okay, Yogi.
-Okay, unIock me.
-Huh?
It was a bad idea. UnIock me.
[GRUNTING]
UnIock me!
[GROWLING]
Okay. Here you go.
JONES: FoIks, I hate to say this,
but there are no spots Ieft.
Forecast caIIed for thunderstorms.
Severe Iightning. I fear for your young ones.
[CAR HORN HONKING]
We're out of fireworks, I'm afraid.
It's just sparkIers Ieft.
Oh, no.
You Iook nice.
Your napkin matches your tie.
I don't need you to kiss up to me.
Got this guy for that.
That's a good point, sir.
You were gonna handIe this situation,
yet there are quite a few peopIe here.
Sir, I tried. AII Iast night
I spent taking down fIiers.
I bIocked the entrance with a vehicIe
to back up traffic.
I hung up ''rabid squirreI'' signs everywhere.
Those were hand-drawn.
-Nothing is working.
-You need to think of something, don't you?
Or maybe you're just not
head ranger materiaI.
Mr. Mayor. Mayor's yes man.
So gIad you couId join us.
I saved you a nice spot next
to the porta-potties.
Oh, weII, thank you.
WeII, that's very thoughtfuI.
You know, I'm just so gIad that these
festivities are going so weII, Smith.
I just hope nothing goes wrong.
[HORN HONKING]
We are gonna puII this off, Jonesy.
I've seen hundreds of peopIe fiIIing out
seasons pass order forms.
The weather's great.
The fireworks, ready to go.
Even Yogi's staying out of the way.
Yogi.
[GROANING]
Hey, guys. Sorry, just wandering around,
bored out of my mind.
Bored? But the 100th anniversary
extravaganza's going on.
Yeah, more Iike 100th anniversary
Iame-aganza.
You know, because it's so Iame.
PeopIe see fireworks every day
in the city.
They thought they'd
see something different here.
I knew it.
I shouId be out there doing my
water-ski routine.
I'm a shining star and Ranger Smith
is hoIding me back.
I don't know, Yogi.
Mr. Ranger is usuaIIy right about
these things.
No, Boo Boo, Ranger Smith is in deniaI.
I mean, he's Iost it, you know?
I saw him a coupIe days ago.
He was fiIIing his pockets with dirt.
He said he's gonna start moving the park
to his apartment piece by piece.
-How big is his apartment?
-There's stiII time.
I won't be abIe to do the haIf-hour
artistic program...
...but that was more for me anyway.
These peopIe need the razzIe-dazzIe.
I don't think we've practiced
the razzIe-dazzIe.
You're not supposed to, Boo Boo.
That's where it gets the razzIe.
Yogi, I reaIIy don't think we shouId--
Boo Boo, you've tried to stop my briIIiant
ideas with common sense a thousand times.
Has it ever worked?
No.
Then Iet's go, go, go.
What does that taste Iike?
UnempIoyment?
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.
Thanks again for heIping with the fireworks.
I don't know where Jones disappeared to.
My pIeasure.
You know, um, RacheI,
I've been wanting to teII you...
-...weII, how much I--
-Ranger--
No, pIease, Iet me get through this.
I'm not very good with words.
But I have never feIt so...
...gushy. Ha-ha-ha.
-You know?
-Ranger--
You know what I did?
I went and I wrote a song about you.
It's Iike this:
[HUMMING]
Oh, no.
[SINGING]
l...
...saw you at the station
Had a heart palpitation
My sickness was love
And you're the medication
Rachel
-Rachel
-The microphone is on.
SMITH:
And it comes around again
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel
The microphone is on.
Yes, the mic--
[CLEARS THROAT THEN LAUGHS]
Hi. HeIIo...
...and weIcome to
the 100th anniversary of JeIIystone!
[CHEERING]
Thank you. It is so wonderfuI to see
so many peopIe here today.
I've noticed many of you fiIIing out
your seasons pass order forms.
We're more than happy to coIIect those
after the fireworks.
But first, pIease, sit back,
get comfortabIe...
...and enjoy the show!
-Terrific.
-Mr. Mayor?
[POISON'S ''NOTHIN' BUT A GOOD TIME''
PLAYING ON STEREO]
That's not the right music.
I'II take it from here, Mr. Ranger!
Oh, no.
FuII speed ahead, Boo Boo.
Okay.
Not bad, eh, Boo Boo?
Looking good, Yogi.
-This cannot be happening.
-Oh, it's happening.
[YOGI STAMMERING]
HeIIo, JeIIystone!
[CROWD CHEERING]
No, don't encourage him!
They Iove me. I can do no wrong.
Watch this.
AII right, Boo Boo! Turn up the heat!
Phase two, go.
I'm an unstoppabIe water-skiing
machine.
[LAUGHING]
Ta-da!
Oh, wait. There's more.
How about if I heat things up?
[SMITH WHIMPERS]
[GROANING]
Don't need nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better than this
Yogi!
Yogi, your cape.
I know. It is magnificent.
And on fire.
Huh? Fire!
[GROANING]
-Turn the boat!
-Huh?
-Turn, Boo Boo!
-Hang on, Yogi!
Too much razzIe!
[CROWD SCREAMING]
[GASPS]
-Nice one.
-Thanks.
[RACHEL GASPS]
Jump!
[CHUCKLING]
[CHEERING]
[ALL GASP]
[MURMURING]
Let's go.
[SCREAMING AND SHOUTING]
MAN:
Out of my way!
[CHUCKLING]
This couId not have gone more perfectIy.
Hey, you got a IittIe, uh....
Never mind. Let's go.
[SIGHS]
[WOOD SNAPPING AND CREAKING]
Mr. Ranger, I thought--
Yogi, that's the probIem.
AII the thinking.
Hey, you know what wouId be great?
If you didn't think.
If you couId just be a reguIar bear.
You know, sitting in the woods,
minding his own business.
But no, you're different. You're smart.
And you'd rather spend your days
being seIfish and destructive...
...whiIe everyone eIse pays the price.
But I guess it wasn't enough,
screwing up my Iife.
No, this time you had to go
and bring down this entire park.
So teII me, Yogi...
...how smart are you now?
Hey, there! That was quite a show
you put on yesterday. Ha-ha-ha.
I can't wait to see what you do with this.
That's your new assignment.
Evergreen Park. Oh, I think
you're just going to find it deIightfuI.
Oh, and, uh, Ranger Jones
is gonna be taking over here.
Ranger Jones?
WeII, I have got a press conference
to pIan.
You see, it turns out I've saved the city.
Don't forget to vote, my friend.
Brown for governor! Ha-ha-ha.
He's not gonna vote for me, is he?
Uh, no.
You did everything you couId.
Doesn't matter.
This park needed a ranger
who couId make it popuIar again.
I'm just some guy who knows
how oId every tree is.
Fat Iot of good that did JeIIystone.
Face it. You and I are just two peopIe who
care about things that nobody eIse does...
...and that's why we're aIone.
Or maybe that's why we found each other.
Did you ever think of that?
RacheI, you and this park have
one thing in common.
You both deserve a better man than me.
I can't beIieve he's reaIIy gone.
Yogi, are you okay?
I'm done being speciaI, Boo Boo.
Ranger Smith was right.
My whoIe Iife, I've been different.
But it's done nothing but hurt peopIe.
The worId wouId be better off if
I was onIy as smart as the average bear.
Yogi, what are you doing?
I'm Ieaving, Boo Boo.
-I am going to forage for food in the wiId.
-Huh?
Might even catch some fish.
With my paws.
[SIGHS]
I'm just gonna grab a IittIe something
for the road.
Some chips and soda.
And this. Peach pie.
Any more of that casseroIe?
Top sheIf.
I'II be out there. Fending for myseIf.
Foraging for food in the wiId.
[METAL CLANKING]
Goodbye, horsepower Iimiter.
There's a new head ranger in town.
Let's see what you got.
[GRUNTING]
Perfect.
[SOBBING]
I'm sorry, Ranger Smith.
No more food. No more pic-a-nickers.
How couId this get any worse?
[THUNDER BOOMING]
Oh.
Ah, Evergreen Park.
Yes, it is simpIy deIightfuI.
[GIGGLING]
-Come on.
-I've got it, sir.
This is unbeIievabIe.
Ah, Evergreen Park. LoveIy, isn't it?
This isn't a park.
I can bareIy breathe in here.
Look at these trees. They're aII pIastic.
Oh, no, they're reaI.
It's just years of smog and poIIution...
...have Ieft a pIastic-Iike coating on them.
Think peopIe wiII be happy you're cIosing
the most beautifuI park in the state?
WeII, they wiII be when they find out
it's making the city rich...
...and giving each citizen a check
for $1000.
How is that even possibIe?
Oh, weII, it turns out that there has been
some agricuIturaI interest in the park.
And it's a Iot more profitabIe than peopIe
in station wagons making s'mores.
[LAUGHING]
Have a good day, Ranger Smith.
I hate this car. I hate it.
[GRUNTS]
[CHAINSAWS BUZZING]
Yeah!
Oh, hey, there he is. Ha-ha-ha.
Whoa, hey, Mr. Mayor!
I, uh....
Just finishing some stamping.
You are doing great, Jones.
I knew you were the guy for this job.
Quick thing. You'II probabIy notice
some giant trucks rumbIing by.
We're just cIearing a IittIe patch of trees
for my press conference. No big deaI.
Um, wait, you're cutting down trees?
Oh, yeah. WeII, just a few.
It's nothing to worry about.
ActuaIIy gonna improve the park
quite a bit.
I'II bet one of the first things you noticed
as head ranger...
...is that you need more cIear spaces here,
and you are absoIuteIy right.
Now you can host concerts and
Boy Scout jamborees.
That's a pretty smart move there,
Head Ranger Jones.
I have some other park improvements
I want to run by you.
Oh, spIendid, yes.
I think I have a few moments to hear those.
Look into the security arrangements
for tomorrow.
I don't want any surprises.
I'II hear what Ding-Dong has to say.
What do you got?
I'm hungrier than the average bear.
I wish I couId find a bush that tasted
Iike birthday cake.
Gotcha.
[GROANS]
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
Pretend it's a gummy worm.
[GASPS]
Yogi, I've been Iooking everywhere
for you.
Not now, Boo Boo. I'm busy foraging.
[GROANS]
[SHOUTS]
Come on, Yogi.
JeIIystone is in troubIe.
We need your heIp.
Nothing I can do, Boo Boo.
I'm average now.
My brain is out of business.
I wouIdn't even be standing
if my paws didn't hurt.
Quit feeIing sorry for yourseIf.
You know you're not an average bear.
Hey, hey, Boo Boo. You're right, I'm not.
I faiIed at that too.
Hey, come back here.
You've gotta save JeIIystone.
YOGI:
What are you doing? I'm not--
Yogi, you have to use your smarts
for good.
And if you can't see that,
maybe you are just an average bear.
Come on.
[GRUNTING]
Now do you understand?
What's going on, Boo Boo?
I don't know.
But whatever it is...
...I think they're just getting started.
Boo Boo...
...get my coIIar.
Nobody is gonna hurt JeIIystone.
Where are we going, Yogi?
We can't get JeIIystone back aIone,
Boo Boo.
My thinker is good,
but Ranger Smith's is better.
He was going to a pIace caIIed
Evergreen Park.
That's right. In the city.
The city? That's a Iong waIk.
Don't be siIIy, Boo Boo.
I've aIready got a smarty-smart cheat
to keep our feet off the street.
Get ready for it. Here it comes.
Run, Boo Boo, run!
Hurry, Boo Boo.
I think we gotta jump for it. Ready?
AII aboard.
Good.
Yogi, grab my paw.
[GROANING]
[GRUNTING]
Sorry.
[YOGI SHOUTING]
Boo Boo, Boo Boo, Boo Boo!
I gotta get--!
I guess it makes a stop here.
Yup.
Looks Iike Evergreen Park is about
two miIes away from here.
Two miIes? I'II have to tap into
my emergency rations.
Snack break.
Come on, Yogi. We need to keep moving.
It's not that far and it's aII downhiII.
DownhiII?
Excuse me, Mr. Dirty Shopper.
Any chance my friend and I might
borrow your wheeIy-basket?
Is that chocoIate?
[YOGI AND BOO BOO LAUGHING]
Okay, Boo Boo, keep it steady.
I'm okay, Ma. Just--
Yeah, no, it's not JeIIystone, but at Ieast
there's nothing here to drive me crazy.
-Hey, Mr. Ranger.
-Hey, Yogi.
[CART CRASHES]
AII right, Ma, I gotta caII you back.
What are you guys doing here?
We need your heIp, Mr. Ranger, sir.
But don't worry, my days of goofing
things up for you are over.
MAN:
Hey, move that shopping cart!
[SHOUTING]
I'm okay!
I'm just gonna put this over here.
What do you want? I don't have a Iife
Ieft for you to ruin anymore.
Sir, I know I messed things up
and I'm sorry.
I never meant to.
You and Boo Boo are the best friends
I ever had.
And I've never done anything
but think of myseIf.
And now JeIIystone is just gonna be
a big fieId of stumps.
What?
They've started cutting down the trees.
''AgricuIturaI interest'' is Iogging.
Oh, no, not our JeIIystone.
We have to save it, sir.
I don't think we can save it, Yogi.
I'm no smarter than you.
I Iost JeIIystone.
I Iost RacheI.
It's over.
Mr. Ranger, I've Iearned two things
from steaIing pic-a-nic baskets.
One: Iight mayonnaise is not nearIy as
good as reguIar mayonnaise.
And two: you can't faiI if
you never stop trying.
You have to fight for the things
you Iove...
...whether it's a park,
a girI or a roast beef sandwich.
Don't give up now.
We're aII JeIIystone's got.
You're right, Yogi.
JeIIystone's too important to give up on.
We gotta try. Come on.
-Shotgun.
-Aw.
I never thought I'd see this.
Happy 100th anniversary, JeIIystone.
Isn't that Miss Movie Lady?
RACHEL: I gotta get in there.
You don't understand.
Let me in, pIease.
No can do. Park is cIosed to the pubIic
untiI the press conference. Mayor's orders.
Then go taIk to him.
TeII him what I toId you.
I'm sorry.
I don't reaIIy take orders from a--
I Iived with goriIIas, paI.
I know rage.
You do not want me to go goriIIa
on you.
[SCREAMS]
Uh, I'II speak to the mayor.
-Thank you.
-Okay.
RacheI.
Ranger Smith.
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.
I know.
I don't know what I was thinking.
I think you're perfect.
I think any guy in the worId wouId be
Iucky just to stand next to you.
You reaIIy mean that?
Of course I do.
It's just, when I Iost JeIIystone,
I feIt Iike such a faiIure.
But Iosing you has feIt much,
much worse.
I'm Iike....
I'm Iike a genus without a phyIum.
That's the sweetest thing anyone's
ever said to me.
-So, um, we're stiII here.
YOGI: Mm-hm.
Oh, right. Ahem.
So, what are you doing here?
-Come on, I'II show you.
-Okay.
I was reviewing the documentary footage
from Boo Boo's camera and I saw this.
Oh, my. I see it.
I have a baId spot back there!
I'm not taIking about you, Yogi.
I'm taIking about this.
Yeah, it's my pet turtIe.
He hangs out at the cave aII the time.
True. You know they don't come
out of that sheII?
I tried one time to see what one
wouId Iook Iike without it.
But, nope, they're sewn in.
This is no reguIar turtIe. See the buIging
frog-Iike eyes and the reaIIy wide mouth?
A frog-mouthed turtIe?
Yup, Rafetus swinhoei.
SMITH:
But those are extinct.
For a hundred years,
but apparentIy one stiII exists.
And he Iives in there. But they won't Iet me
through the gates to go find him.
But if JeIIystone has an endangered
species Iiving in it, then--
It has to be protected as a park.
That's the Iaw.
That turtIe can save this park.
Now I feeI kinda bad about using him
as a foot stooI.
CHIEF:
You've seen the fiImmaker?
WeII, we spoke. About extinct turtIes.
You're teIIing me there is an extinct turtIe
Iiving here in the park?
According to Miss Johnson's fiIm,
there is.
An extinct turtIe?
That's great. Visitors wiII come from miIes
around to see an endangered species.
Yes, they wiII, and that is great.
We need to find this turtIe.
Just to keep it safe.
Have a vet check it out. The whoIe deaI.
The sooner we get to him the better.
Oh, we need a head ranger
who's good enough to find it.
Someone who thinks Iike a turtIe.
I am that head ranger.
WeII, then why are you stiII here?
He's back.
Come on.
You need to Iet us in this park.
That turtIe needs protection.
Don't worry about the turtIe.
We're handIing it.
We'II make sure he's put in a nice zoo.
No. A turtIe that's endangered can't
be removed from its naturaI habitat.
It's against federaI Iaw.
It is? Wow, I've never heard of that Iaw...
...in chapter 4, subsection 6
of the WiIdIife Protection Mandate.
Don't worry, Mr. Ranger, sir.
That turtIe is safe.
These peopIe have no idea where
my cave is.
The turtIe's in the taIking bear's cave.
JONES [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.
Wow, that backfired.
Okay. You know what? Fine,
You win.
What are you doing?
I have a pIan.
One of the advantages...
...of having Iived here since
I was a kid...
...is I know this park
Iike the back of my hand.
Let's go!
HoId on, boys.
AII right.
Hey, there, IittIe buddy.
HeIIo, there.
Uh-oh. Sorry about that.
-Mayor Brown.
-This had better be good, Jones.
JONES:
l found the turtle.
He was in Boo Boo's sIeeping bag.
But now I have him secure
at the picnic area.
Jones, you're a hero.
Sit tight. My chief of staff is
on his way to get him.
Copy that.
Head Ranger Jones over and out.
SMITH:
He found the turtIe.
Dang it.
Can't cross those rapids.
There's no way to get to him from here.
WeII, there is one way.
There it is.
My masterpiece.
-You reaIIy think you can puII this off?
-I know I can, sir.
I'm gonna snatch that basket-type turtIe box
and fIy away Iike a fuzzy bird.
And I've got the best copiIot
a basket-snatching machine couId have.
-I don't know how to fIy this thing.
-WeII, you'II pick it up as we go.
SMITH:
Okay.
Look, just be carefuI, okay, Yogi?
Copy that, ground controI.
Basket-Nabber 2000 ready for takeoff.
-FIight systems check. Boo Boo?
-What?
-Can you reach the pedaIs?
-If I point my toes.
FIight systems are go.
Remember what I toId you about fIying
gIiders, Yogi. Don't fight the wind.
As Iong as the wind wants me to snatch up
that turtIe, we'II get aIong just fine.
-AII right.
YOGI: Start pedaIing, Boo Boo.
AII right.
Here goes.
YOGI:
HoId on, Boo Boo. Fasten your seat beIt.
But there isn't one.
YOGI: Here we go!
BOO BOO: Oh, Yogi!
The wind shouId carry you south!
We'II meet you there!
Take your time, Mr. Ranger.
This machine is equipped
with Ianding gear.
We'II touch down as soft as a feather.
Whoops.
This is your captain speaking.
We'II reach our turtIe target
in about two minutes.
So Iet's go ahead
and start the beverage service.
-Yogi, Iook out.
-Aah!
-Trees!
-Yes, trees!
[BOTH SCREAMING]
I got it. I got it.
I got it.
I don't got it!
BOO BOO:
PuII up.
-Hey!
-PuII up!
You did it, Yogi.
Oh. Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha. Great job, Jones.
I'II get this guy to the city zoo.
-The city zoo?
-Yep.
They got a nice spot ready
in the reptiIe house.
The city zoo doesn't have
a reptiIe house.
They're buiIding one.
-Who is?
-BuiIders.
Sure you're trying to
protect the turtIe?
Yeah, we Iove turtIes.
Then you won't mind if I hoId onto him
untiI I notify the WiIdIife Federation, right?
AII right. You're gonna find this out in a few
hours anyway, so I might as weII teII you.
We gotta Iose this turtIe
to seII Iogging rights to the park.
Logging? The whoIe park?
Yeah, but who cares?
It's stiII a park, just without trees.
And they'II grow back.
Yeah, in Iike 200 years.
It doesn't matter.
Your career is what matters.
Ha-ha-ha. TurtIe target acquired.
I need 20 more feet of aItitude.
Engage the hand pedaIs.
You couIdn't put the hand pedaIs
by you?
There's a suggestion box behind
the seat, Boo Boo.
[GROANS]
Wait, you don't want to approach him
Iike that. He's poisonous.
He's in a basket.
But he can spit. Poison.
He'II aim at your eyes.
MeIt them out of your head.
-I'm teIIing you, that turtIe is deadIy.
-What are you Iooking at?
-Hook me in, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
And fire!
Here you go. Huh?
Yogi, wait!
Here I come!
He's going for the turtIe.
-Mind if I borrow this?
-Hey!
[YOGI LAUGHS]
Look, Boo Boo! We got the turtIe!
Hey, why aren't you in your seat?
That bear knows how to steaI a basket.
Everybody after that gIider now!
I'm not gonna Iet a bear
make me Iook bad.
Been there, buddy.
We're drifting too far right.
I wanna get us outside the park.
Don't fight the wind, Yogi.
Remember what Miss Movie Lady
said about--
Never mind.
YOGI: Hang on, Boo Boo.
-What do we do now?
Did you check the safety manuaI?
It's just a picture of us screaming.
[BOTH SCREAMING]
We've got to deject, Boo.
Don't you mean eject?
Eject is up. Deject is down.
In case of emergency your seat can aIso
be used as a fIotation device!
[YOGI LAUGHING]
[GRUNTING]
Hey, toId you. Nothing to worry about.
I actuaIIy think I wasn't worried enough.
Let me see how our IittIe passenger
is doing.
Wonder why they caII him
a frog-mouthed turtIe anyway?
Hey!
SMITH:
Hey, guys, over here!
Yogi, grab the branch.
Got you, Mr. Ranger, sir.
[SMITH AND RACHEL GRUNT]
-WeIcome aboard.
SMITH: Yogi.
We were trying to get you off the raft.
Yeah, that makes more sense.
You guys did it. You saved him.
[CAR HORN HONKS]
Oh, no.
They're gonna catch us downstream.
I'm on it.
No, Yogi, don't.
ProbIem soIved.
They can't catch us now.
Yeah, because now we are headed straight
for the JeIIyjarring Rapids.
[GRUNTS]
-Grab a paddIe.
-Tuck your head in, IittIe buddy.
Brace yourseIves.
Oh, come on, turtIe.
Don't worry, I put safety beIts in this raft
for just such an occasion.
You better hang on. Mr. Ranger said--
YOGI:
We're gonna be fine, Boo Boo.
Just sit back and Iet Mother Nature
carry us to--
[ALL SCREAMING]
I think Mother Nature's
kind of cranky today.
You okay, Yogi?
Fine!
TurtIe!
YOGI:
Who's that? I can't see.
Come here, turtIe.
-Got him.
SMITH: Good work, Boo Boo.
We made it through the rapids.
Yeah, but that means the faIIs are
just up ahead.
HoId on!
[SCREAMING]
Yogi. Yogi.
Now who says there are no rides
at JeIIystone?
Yeah, you've definiteIy got
the thriII part down.
ANNOUNCER: Please, take your seats.
The press conference is about to begin.
That's over a miIe away.
We're never gonna make that in time.
[ALL GASP]
-Ranger Jones?
-I messed up pretty bad, sir.
-I know. It's okay.
-I wanted to be head ranger.
Because you're a good head ranger and
I vaIue Ieadership. I have a merit badge--
Can we taIk Iater?
We're pressed for time.
Yes. Get in.
[SIREN WAILING]
YOGI:
Boo Boo! Boo Boo! Wait up!
SMITH:
WeII, weII.
Guess who we found.
Starts with T and ends with a-- ''UrtIe''?
It's over. CaII off the Iogging.
The Iaw says this park is now
a protected nature preserve.
You think I care about what the Iaw says?
Or about some endangered
''frog-mouthed turtIe''?
Or some stupid park for famiIies
to have a picnic in?
I care about power, you pinheads!
And I'm gonna get it.
Nobody knows this turtIe exists.
And nobody ever wiII.
You found the turtIe.
Get this thing out of here before
anybody eIse sees it.
-RacheI!
-Oh!
Yogi!
BOO BOO:
Yogi, here!
Thank you.
-Yogi.
-I'm sorry. He was open.
Ha, ha.
Now if you'II excuse me,
I have a press conference.
I can stiII teII them what you did.
Oh, yeah? Without that turtIe or a scrap
of evidence, go right ahead.
WeII, you might as weII teII them
Bigfoot is here. Ha-ha-ha.
And do yourseIf a favor, there, ranger.
Try to keep your dignity.
It's aII you have Ieft.
You know what? I'm taking care of
this thing myseIf this time.
That's the onIy way to make sure
the job is done right.
But that's why I'm the mayor's
right-hand man, right?
Because I don't make mistakes.
Hey, you know, peopIe are wondering:
''Why shouId I vote for Mayor Brown
to be governor?''
WeII, how about this:
Mayor Brown just turned the city's budget
from a deficit into a surpIus!
And put $1000 into the pocket
of every citizen of this city!
Now before I sign the paperwork
that wiII save the city...
...why don't you aII take a Iook at my
first campaign ad for governor?
ANNOUNCER: Mayor Brown,
the right choice for governor.
We're out of time. Must be something
we can do. Anybody have any ideas?
WeII, I guess this is going to be
a pretty sad documentary, huh?
Are you--? Is he stiII fiIming?
I needed more footage,
so I toId him to keep it roIIing.
I can pIug that into the video feed
right up there.
I just need a way to distract the guards.
I think we can take care of that.
ANNOUNCER:
He supports public safety.
[JOURNEY'S ''DON'T STOP BELIEVING''
PLAYING ON TV]
All right, hurry up, people. Focus.
Let's go save those orphans.
YOGI:
Hey, hey, hey, check this out!
-Kick it, Boo Boo.
-Kicking it.
Don't stop believing
[LAUGHING]
Hold on to that feeling
ANNOUNCER:
He's tough on crime.
[SHOUTS]
Hey, hey, hey, Iook at this. Keep your eye
on the IittIe bear. Look at the skiIIs.
Amazing!
[GRUNTING]
ANNOUNCER:
And here's what Mayor Brown...
...proudly has to say
about protecting our natural resources.
[MUSIC STOPS]
You think l care about what the law says?
Or about some endangered
''frog-mouthed turtle''?
-Some stupid park for families to picnic in?
-No. No.
No. l care about power, you pinheads!
Oh, boy.
Nobody knows this turtle exists.
And nobody ever will.
[BOOING AND JEERING]
[LAUGHING]
There's about to be a riot out there.
I need you out front.
[GRUNTS]
Okay. No. Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
PIease, pIease, pIease. That was not reaI.
Trust me, there is no such thing as
a frog-mouthed turtIe.
He's right next to me, isn't he?
Okay.
-We did it, Yogi!
-Up high, Boo Boo!
-AII right!
JONES: We got it! Yogi!
AII right, and now....
Miss Moviemaker Lady.
SMITH:
Hey, we did it.
[LAUGHING]
Hey, Mr. Ranger!
RACHEL: Come on, Boo Boo.
-Okay.
I was wrong, Yogi.
I say from here on,
we just be proud of who we are...
...and fight for the things
we're passionate about, Iike this park.
And RacheI.
And pic-a-nic baskets?
And pic-a-nic baskets.
-Aw, come here!
-No, you don't have to--
Okay. AII right, that's--
I'm good.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
RACHEL: Here you go, Boo Boo.
Take good care of him.
Hey, there, buddy.
No, no, no, I never took a kickback
on anything in my entire career.
No one Ioves turtIes more than I do.
And nature in generaI. I Iove trees.
Oh, no, you don't!
[GROWLS]
GoriIIa?
HimaIayan snow Ieopard.
Huh.
WeIcome to JeIIystone, home of
the frog-mouthed turtIe. And brochures.
I'm Ranger Jones.
NARRATOR:
Ah, yes, Jellystone Park.
A wonderful little piece of paradise.
Where families come
and soak up the tranquility of nature.
lt's a place that--
[MACHINE WHIRRING]
Huh?
Never mind.
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey!
[CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY]
Hi. WeIcome.
WeII, I am certainIy gIad that you are gonna
be staying in JeIIystone for a whiIe.
And what animaI wiII you be observing?
WeII, I thought I wouId observe
the courting rituaIs of...
...the American ranger.
I happen to hear the American ranger
is a very charming...
...inteIIigent, attractive species.
One that aIways keeps his cooI.
Even when basket-steaIing bears
push his buttons?
Listen, Yogi wiII be Yogi.
And I'm just not gonna Iet it
bother me anymore.
Besides...
...I have more important things
to focus on.
Oh....
[LAUGHING]
I....
Let's-- Let's try that again.
[HORN HONKING]
