Oh... what's the name
of that Burt Reynolds picture
with the banjo?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
that one
with that retarded kid.
He was good, that guy.
Yeah, he was good.
"Deliverance."
Coupla nights ago, me and Denise
we popped that into the DVD.
We're about an hour
into this thing
and I start
thinking to myself
"this story ain't
very realistic."
You're a lonely mountain man.
They're destroying your home.
They've taken your job.
There is no place
to set your still.
You are angry-
they've destroyed
everything that
validates your manhood.
You're confused;
your sexuality is in question.
You decide you're going
to hit for the other side.
You want yourself
some man meat-
I understand that-
but wouldn't you wait
for Burt Reynolds
to come downriver?
Two... drifters
off to see the world
there's such a lot of world
to see...
we're after the same...
rainbow's end...
waitin' 'round the bend
my Huckleberry friend
moon...
river
and me.
This is critical Jim,
the hit man.
He loves two things:
his job and old movies.
This is me- Finch.
I'm his mark.
He thinks I'm Cletis Tout.
I have Tout.
Gladstone hotel, #8.
Transfer funds
to Telmark Konickson.
"M" as in McQueen.
0-1-2-2-6-2-2-6
"F," as in Fonda.
"T" as in Tracy
"K" as in Kubrick.
You've got 90 minutes
or I let him go.
Terrific film.
It's almost hypnotic.
You know why?
The third act.
It has a third act.
Ow!
Gum?
No, thanks.
You don't see that
in movies these days.
These days...
it's all about the gimmick.
Great set up...
Great first act...
...then, "let's blow
something up."
When you concentrate
on the gimmick
and you shortchange
the ending
the audience
leaves unfulfilled.
Man, there's nothing like...
...a great movie.
I love the movies.
I mean, the old movies
you know, where it
was all about the story.
I've got a story.
I'll bet you do.
Yeah, yeah,
this one's got it all-
prison break, jewel heist...
Girl.
Pitch me.
Pinch you?
Pitch me.
It's a Hollywood thing.
It's where the asshole
with all the power
you know,
makes you dance like a monkey.
What's in it for me?
Maybe you get
to live a little longer.
Maybe if your story's so good
when that pager rings,
I might forget where I am...
I'm at the movies.
Nobody remembers their job
at the movies.
Uh, well, let's see, uh...
I think it was 1977,
New York City...
no, no. No, no, no.
No one will shoot in New York.
It's way too expensive.
Let's call it
"city non-specific."
And the whole thing's
in the '70s?
No, no, just the...
just the beginning.
Like a flashback.
Perfect.
Fantastic.
I love the flashback-
much maligned,
oft-misunderstood flashback.
Pitch me.
It was 1977...
the uh, the city's
diamond exchange.
There was a magician...
well done.
What time was it?
I need to get a feel
for the setting.
Uh, 4:00 p.m.- Closing time.
My apologies, sister.
Mr. Tobias
the school day ends
at 3:00 p.m. Promptly.
We're not a baby-sitting
service.
No time to talk, sister.
Watch this.
What's this?
Wait.
That's not it, is it?
Is that how it ends?
He just buries the diamonds
in a field?
No, no, that's not it.
It's just the beginning.
It was, uh, september,
almost three weeks to the day.
I was serving seven years
in the federal pen
in north carolina-
fraud, forgery,
passports, documents.
I gave people new identities.
If you wanted to disappear,
I was the guy you called.
Micah Tobias- aka the magician.
25 years grand theft.
The take: diamonds.
Market value: $4.5 million,
never recovered.
I got your birds.
My job: two homing pigeons,
camera, Kodachrome film
and an escape plan.
My take: a cool million.
This day, we became partners.
I got your birds.
Are they marked?
The address you gave me.
Camera and film?
Already in your cell.
Alvie, I was
under the impression
this being a communal garden
we'd all take a vote
before we move the scarecrow.
I woke up this morning
and found out
that for the past two months
you've had your fist
up my ass.
I don't like your fist
in my ass, Finch.
Any free hand in this yard
steals for me.
You want anything,
you come to me.
That's the deal.
That's how it works!
Any questions?
I don't know where
you did your MBA work
but I believe
you're confusing "deal"
which is an arrangement
for mutual benefit...
with extortion.
Iisten, you
mother-fuckin' cocksucker
you don't know me.
I could cut your head
right off!
Stand down now!
You got a problem
with that, henry?
Iights out, men. Lights out.
Micah, how's it look?
Pretty good.
Iast chance.
I'll be out of here
soon enough.
We should stick
to the original plan.
You know he's going
to try and kill you.
I'll be okay.
Come on!
Got to move it!
Move through the dirt.
Single file for mess.
Drop down!
Finch, get in!
Finch?
With me?
I'm here.
You all right?
Yeah.
All right, we go on three.
One... two... three.
Come on.
Let's go, come on.
Jump!
One word, three syllables.
The clue is:
a need to disappear.
Gravedigger?
Mikey.
Finch! I thought
you were in jail!
No, I'm in a lot of trouble.
I need your help.
I need... I need a kit,
and I need a body.
Where are you?
I'm in the city.
There's a safe house
on the east side.
A bar called fillmore's.
Can you get there?
Yeah.
Ask for Delores.
Tell her Savian sent you.
She'll know what to do.
I got a friend.
Vitals?
55-year-old caucasian male
approximately five-nine,
150 pounds.
I'll see what I can do.
Where the hell you been?
Well, I couldn't hide them
in my jacket forever, could I?
Quite a deal, this cage.
Look at this-
got a faux bottom.
Huh?
You can hide things
in it and everything.
God, the magician in me
just loves this stuff.
You're not Cletis Tout.
No.
I've got a strong feeling
that before the day is out
someone's going
to make use of that
rather expressive, though
somewhat old-fashioned, term:
foul play.
"Rebecca," United Artists, 1940.
If you're not Tout, who are you?
I'm Finch.
Finch.
Cletis Tout was a bottom-feeder.
Called himself
a video journalist
but he was really just a thug
with a camera.
Worked alone.
His client list included
all those tabloid shows.
His mark was anybody who made
their living in the public eye.
There was a bachelor party
for some mobster's son-
kid named Rowdy Virago.
His dad, "Paulie the fist," ran
a little group called
the vissari crime family.
Rowdy was high-profile.
He liked that movie star status
but every time he put his face
in front of a flashbulb
there was trouble.
Now Rowdy was tapped
to take over the family.
He was an untouchable.
You can only imagine what price
the tabloids would pay
for one shining moment in this
little Alice's wonderland...
but Tout could imagine it.
He made it his mission
to bring Virago down.
They picked up a hooker
about 11:30...
took her to a loft downtown.
Tout was there.
Tout thinks
he's hit the jackpot.
Virago's got
a bit of a problem:
he likes it rough.
Tonight he's got
a bigger problem:
she likes it rough, too.
That's when things went wrong.
He's got the poor girl
by the throat.
Tout made three copies
of the tape.
One he kept for himself
the second he mailed
to a neighbor
and a third he mailed
to paulie the fist.
Now here's the heir to the most
powerful crime family
in the city, and now
he's on the chopping block.
They got rid of the body,
and nobody'd come calling.
They thought
they were home free
until Tout
stuck his nose in.
So they decided to kill him.
This is impossible. Fuck it.
I ain't pushin' no more.
Maybe he's got his foot
on the brake.
Man, for a dead guy,
he drives good.
I got his hands wired
to the fuckin' wheel.
Oh. What's the name of
that, uh, fancy place?
The one that, uh,
makes all the donuts
with the sprinkles.
Oh, yeah, that place.
Ronnie Savalla's sister
works over there.
You know,
I think she's a man.
Yeah. She looks good.
You know, she's keeping
the, uh, sideburns short.
You smell smoke?
Oh!
All right, then,
here's what we got-
we got a man
approximately six feet tall.
Uh, looks like
he pissed somebody off
'cause they shaked and baked him
before they shot him.
Any weapon?
Yeah, small-caliber
machine gun.
What's different about you?
What?
You know something?
you do look different.
I, uh...
work out
a little more lately, you know.
Eating a lot of fruit.
I went on a colon cleanse.
You need roughage
why don't you eat
the hairpiece?
Oh, that's it!
You got a piece!
Hell, yo, that... it's nice.
It's nice.
It was a hot afternoon.
I can still remember
the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.
How could I have known
that murder can sometimes
smell like honeysuckle?
"Double Indemnity,"
Paramount, 1944.
The film's strength
is deftly crafted use
of the flashback.
Now here's my question:
can we have a flashback
within a flashback?
God, I hate this place.
What have we got?
Some hotshot named Savian.
Forensic pathologist,
works for the FBI.
He was in with the bodies
for about ten minutes
this morning.
What'd our guy come up with?
Nothing on the male.
The female?
Eh, they're pretty sure
that she was strangled.
- Pretty sure?
- Yeah.
Gentlemen.
No coffee in here.
This isn't "Quincy."
It'll be our
little secret, huh?
So, what do we have
for lunch?
Jane Doe number 1-0-9-Charlie.
Caucasian, female
25 years old.
Five foot, six inches tall.
112 pounds.
You guys have done
a print search
blood work, stomach analysis.
As far as you can tell,
she liked hot dogs
and may have
been strangled.
Do you know the first thing
I look at when I see
a body like this?
The tits.
Straight for the tits.
I mean, look at this.
She's like a carnival ride.
Saline implant.
The only company who makes
this model, Johnson Levy.
Behind every bag
is a serial number.
Behind every serial number
there's a name.
Gentlemen...
meet Merrill Candide.
I found
four different types
of spermicidal jelly-
the type used in condoms.
Now either Merrill
and her sweetheart
have been sampling rubbers
or sweet little Candide is...?
She's a hooker.
Would somebody get kojak
a sucker?
What killed her?
Compression scars
on the neck...
marbling.
The lady's been strangled.
It's all in the file.
I'm going to need another
day for the hot-rodder-
you know, barbecue
boy next door.
All I got is
small-caliber machine gun
five gallons of gas
and a match.
And you say the only thing
that links these two
is the area
where they were found?
That's right.
Dr. Savian,
phone call, line one.
Thank you.
Savian.
One word, three syllables.
The clue is:
a need to disappear.
Gravedigger?
Mikey.
Finch, I thought you were
in jail.
Hiya, Finch.
Mikey.
I know we don't have
a lot of time
and I don't want
to know anything.
I'm going to keep it clean
and I'm going to keep it simp...
Micah Tobias.
Not for long.
This is a freebie.
You kept me out of jail
by keeping your mouth closed.
I thank you.
My wife thanks you.
My children thank you.
This is the last time
you'll hear from me.
And I know this is the last time
I'll hear from you.
Here's your package.
You have a computer,
laser printer, camera
plenty of film
paper for photographs.
You have your trim kit.
There's enough here
to make you both
driver's licenses
supporting id,
the whole nine yards.
Passports, I have a problem.
I can't access one
of the numbers
without fingers pointing.
Finch, this is going
to be your job.
You are now marcel zavoya.
55-year-old
unemployed office worker.
We found him
with his head in the oven.
His passport number I have.
This is you.
Be careful with this one, man.
Somebody set fire
to the poor bastard.
I have his address
and his vitals.
I even have his keys.
I found them three inches deep,
in his thigh.
You're going to have to go
to his house
and find his passport.
How much time you going to need?
Couple of weeks.
We, uh, we got a few things
we got to take care of.
You got $10,000
in cash.
It'll take you most places
you want to go.
This is a gift... from my wife.
Spend the night
here tonight.
Leave everything you
don't absolutely need.
There's a rack
with clothes.
Tomorrow, you are dead
and I never want to hear
from you again.
My brother, it is so good
to see you again.
Good to be seen.
Marcel, au revoir.
Adieu.
Take a look at this.
You've been completely
reinvented.
You are now officially
marcel zavoya.
There's your passport,
birth certificate...
driver's license.
You got to wear
your corrective lenses to drive.
You're an official
card-carrying member
of the aarp-
no senior should be without it.
And the coup de grace,
your sag card.
It's a dream you
always wanted to pursue.
Now that the kids are grown, you
finally found that "me" time.
Now for me
I got to get
Tout's passport number.
That's first on the list.
You can't dope the number?
I don't want to chance it.
Pick the wrong number,
it's over.
It shouldn't be a problem,
though.
It says here
the guy is a journalist.
My guess is, he has one.
Now the real question is
when do you want to go
after those diamonds?
What are you doing?
Hi, daddy.
Oh.
You know, it's funny-
in all the time I spent
with the old man
he never once mentioned
he had a daughter.
He found her.
I couldn't fault him for it.
Yeah, I was only along
out of circumstance.
I left them alone
for the time being.
I was sure they had
some catching up to do
more than 20 years worth.
Besides, I had other things
on my mind.
I needed that passport number.
Hello, mr. Tout.
It is Tout
isn't it?
So, you're my new neighbor.
I can tell you one thing-
I cannot wait for that
neighborhood watch meeting.
This came for me today.
Naughty, naughty.
The note said for me
to hold onto it
Till I heard from you.
It also said not to open it.
Sorry.
First floor:
lingerie.
Next stop, mr. Tout,
the basement.
The dirty, dirty basement.
Oh.
It's just Mrs. Stanton.
Her hobby is anything I do!
It's gotten to be
where I can't even bring
anyone home anymore.
But you... you're already home.
Stop in
for a drink sometime.
I'm up late.
Very, very late.
Detective Delaney, please.
Oh, Detective, I didn't expect
to get you so late.
Well, this is doris stanton.
You remember that you asked me
to let you know
if mr. Tout came by?
Well, he's at home right now.
We'll send somebody over
right away.
You got a big problem.
You got the wrong guy.
He's at home right now
and if you hurry,
you can catch him
but don't kill him
in the building
and if you do... whack
the old lady in number nine.
Hello, dip and shit.
How's your supper?
What's wrong?
You killed the wrong guy,
that's what's wrong, putzo.
That's impossible.
I give you
a simple job
and all you two can do
is blow so much smoke up my ass
it's a miracle I ain't died
of rectal cancer!
We got a bead on him?
He's at home right now.
Now, you take the car
and you do it right this time.
You hit him outside.
You get him a couple miles
away from the place.
I don't want anybody
seeing you do this.
And dump him body
on the west side this time!
You got a paper trail
helen keller could follow!
We should eat first.
Who the fuck's Helen Keller?
Mr. Tout?
Mr. Tout?
Passport's nowhere to be found.
I think this Tout
was in serious trouble.
You should see the gig
they pulled on his apartment.
Iooks like a dump site.
On top of that,
I'm officially paranoid.
I could swear
I was being followed.
Finch, we got a plan.
Yeah, what's that?
Tomorrow, we go
for the diamonds.
"We"?
What, she knows?
What the hell are you doing?
You know better than to tell
some dame.
- Dame?
- Let me ask you something.
Do you have any idea
what you're getting
involved with?
You're aiding and abetting
a fugitive. That's a felony.
Did you actually
just call me a dame?
What, you've been in prison
since the '50s?
You think
you're in the rat pack?
Listen, Ma Barker...
that's it.
I'm not listening to another
word from this guy.
You're not in charge,
all right?
I-I'm a career criminal.
I should be in charge.
I'm the superhero of crime.
I should have a big "C"
on my chest.
Oh?
I like this girl.
She's like the classic
film ingenue-
bright, complicated,
but with a softer side...
Iike katharine hepburn.
And you know what else?
I think the old man knew
this was coming.
That's why he
brought her along.
This supposed to impress me?
She's okay because she breaks
into a- a pottery shop?
This isn't a crime;
this is... this is embarrassing.
Breaking into a bank,
that's a crime.
When's the last time
you broke into someplace
with a key?
About two hours ago.
Well, at least it'll make
for some story
in the prison mess.
"What are you in for?"
"Broke into a kiln."
Better yet,
when the judge asks me
how do I plead
I'll just give him
that glazed look.
Daddy, I put together
some things.
Uh, sweetheart,
that's all well and good
if you're stealing
the hope diamond.
Fortunately, we're just
trying to break into a field
and, uh...
you know how I feel about that.
What is that,
a gun?
You keep a gun
in a pottery shop?
Oh, I just...
I love this one.
What is it?
It's an urn.
Ah. An urn.
That explains the gun.
You okay?
Oh, god. Oh, it's incredible.
How many people die
or get killed in
this city every day?
And the one guy
I choose to be
is the only dead guy
in the city
Everybody wants to kill.
Micah, see anything out there?
Daddy?
Micah?
Daddy?
Hey...
Micah?
Oh, god!
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait. What happened?
Did they get him?
I mean, he just found her.
He's got to give her
The diamonds
to make things right.
Did-did he have time
to say good- bye?
He didn't die right there?
Well, that's really
all kind of a blur, you know?
I, uh...
just remember bits and pieces.
He said he wanted
to go to the park.
We were all alone.
He said he wanted me
to take care of her.
Made me promise him.
There was a feather.
He said...
"there's magic in something
as simple as a feather."
Whatever the heck that means.
And then he died.
Fuck!
Guess what, fuckos?
you missed again.
Yeah, 500 rounds
and the only damage is
a ceramic bath set
and a 50-year-old man.
Iet me ask you something.
Is this some sort
of master plan?
You kill all Tout's associates
so we got nobody to play with?
What, we trying to bore him
to death here?
Huh? Make him so despondent
at the thought of no buddies
that he puts a gun in his mouth?
What the fuck's wrong with you?!
Call Critical Jim.
So, um, how many people
have you killed?
"I don't believe
I've ever killed a man
that didn't deserve it."
"The Shootist,"
Warner Brothers, 1976.
Hey, look,
killing's a business.
The truth is,
they all deserved it.
Hey, I have a reputation.
I clean up people's
dirty little secrets.
When that pager rings
that mean you're going
to kill me?
"Haven't you learned the rules
"of probability and outcomes?
"Aren't you aware
that every question
"of life or death
remains a probability
until the outcome?"
"Heaven can wait." Paramount.
1978.
Have you ever been
to a movie?
Tell me more about the girl.
Well, we hadn't spoken
in about a week.
I tried to contact her
after Micah died
but she'd have nothing of it.
So, I checked in here
at the gladstone.
Couldn't get the old man's
voice out of my head.
Four years I spent with him
and all I could think about was
the last thing he said to me.
"Take care of her."
I can't even take care
of myself.
And then it hit me.
Tess
Hi.
I think I know how
to find the diamonds.
What? I thought we
could partner up on this thing.
You know, I mean,
split it 50/50.
Honor among thieves and all.
Don't let me into your group.
You're the superhero of crime.
You're the one with the big "C"
on his chest, remember?
Obviously, you do.
Iook, I'm not splitting anything
with you 50/50.
Do you know why?
Because there should be
some sort of a clause
a jiggins clause.
Do you know
what a jiggins is?
It's a congenital idiot,
a mongoloid.
So, every time
you do something stupid
every time
you give me the jiggins
I take five percent.
Now, it's been one week
with the map.
That was stupid.
That's a jiggins- 55/45.
Hey, this has nothing
to do with your dad.
This is about you.
You're-you're greedy.
You just want it
all for yourself.
It's not the diamonds.
I want the box.
I just want the box.
You've obviously
touched a nerve.
The box- it must
mean something to her.
Tess, come on.
What do you want from me?
I'll tell you what I want.
I want you to shut
your pie hole!
Okay, look, I'm coming up,
all right?
Jiggins! 60/40.
Look, how many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?
Ooh.
Jesus!
65/35.
It's not a jiggins.
It's a mistake.
I mean, it's dark up here.
I can't see anything.
Failure to comprehend
the concept.
Jiggins. 70/30.
Let me ask you a question.
Are you possessed
by the devil?
Hmm. That's funny. Very funny.
And I don't mean "ha-ha" funny.
I mean, "I've been
in prison for 20 years
and feel comfortable
in pumps" kind of funny.
Ha. Suppression
of sexual tendencies.
Not very evolved.
Jiggins. 75/25.
Okay, that's it.
I got my own clause.
Tell me if you know
what this word means, all right?
What the hell is all this crap?
You're a freak.
Oh, is that your clause?
'cause that was, uh, nine words.
Well, eight with
a contraction.
I mean, you asked me
if knew what a word meant.
That's singular.
"Word" is singular.
"What's all this crap?
You're a freak" is plural
in terms of words, anyway.
Oh, no, it's singular.
Why? because I'm
running them all together
because this is my word,
my clause
the-the "what's all this crap?
You're a freak" clause
known henceforth
as "the clause."
Now, every time
you break the clause
I take back ten percent.
Let's see how many times
you've broken the clause.
How about
ever since I met you?
Do you know what that means?
You not only owe me 100%
of that map,
but for the next 50 years
you have to kiss
my red, rosy, puckered crack.
Ooh. That was nice.
Real descriptive.
"Kiss my rosy, red,
puckered crack."
I should shoot you right now.
Wow. I'm just telling you
what happened.
I, uh... I didn't realize I was
going to be critiqued here.
What's my name?
Excuse me?
Critical Jim.
Say it.
Critical Jim.
What do you suppose that means?
Where are we going now?
Uh, after the diamonds.
Under the old man's tree?
That's right.
80/20.
Tess found the old man's tree
or what was left of it...
and the diamonds,
they were safe...
safe behind the walls
of a minimum- security prison.
Now, we're moving.
Classic plot twist.
They'll never see it coming.
Now, if you'd just get
this love story off the ground
We'd have ourselves a picture.
It's late in the second act,
and we need a back story.
All right.
Who is this girl?
The girl.
What's the deal
with the birds?
They're homing pigeons.
When my father
went to prison
they were the only way
we could communicate.
It actually works?
I thought it was
just some story from the war.
Yeah, he had them tagged
to the house
my foster family lived in.
Where was your mom?
She died when I was six.
Oh. Sorry.
When I was eight, I was moved
to another foster family
and the birds never came back.
I thought for sure
he'd forgotten me.
He found me.
What's so important
about the box?
It's just
this dumb little picture.
Okay.
Here you go.
Bye.
Are you crying?
No.
Yes.
This thing's worse
than "terms of endearment."
But at least we have
our tag line.
I mean...
"you thought it was hard
breaking out of prison-
try breaking in."
You are going
to break in again.
You got to get the box
and then it means
so much to her.
When I get like this, I hate it.
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
It's for the story.
Make it much more interesting.
Use your hands now.
Gesture, all right.
All right,
what we need now is some action
some bang-bang
shoot- 'em- up action
just like when I first met you.
The diamonds
were a moot point...
or were they?
I was on my way
back to the gladstone.
My worst fear
wasn't getting caught.
My worst fear was
getting killed.
I was a man
with a death sentence.
Somebody wanted me dead,
but why?
Then it hit me.
The tape.
The Maltese falcon.
My god, they wanted
the Maltese falcon.
So I waited
until it got dark
and I went back to Tout's.
"This is my life.
"It always will be.
"There's nothing else-
just us and the camera
and those wonderful people
out there in the dark."
"All right, Mr. Demille.
I'm ready for my close-up."
"Sunset Boulevard."
Paramount, 1950.
Well, hello, captain naughty.
Somebody's
in all kinds of trouble.
Trouble?
Oh, my puckish little rogue.
So tired of running
from the law?
The law?
The law.
The big, strapping law.
We know your little secret.
You're part dillinger
and part adonis.
Could you guys just excuse
me for a couple of minutes?
I'll be right with you.
Oh, yo, man, look.
Hey, you know what?
That shit ain't right.
Hey, we gotta finish...
I'm for real, man!
You make me...
Look. Look at me, brother!
Come here, man!
Come here!
What's your problem, bitch?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
First thing is
I'm not your bitch.
I'm a concerned citizen
and I don't like what
you're doing to my country.
Well, that's great
Captain America.
What are you going
to do about it, huh?
Hey! I like that
Captain America nickname.
How about Captain American?
The last four letters
intrigue me.
"I can"!
That should be
a fucking motto around here.
What can you do when people
start doing
bullshit like this?
You know what?
I can kill them.
That's what I can do.
You know what I want
you to do right now?
Come over here and draw
on your buddy's
head right here
"I will not deface
these United States of America"
and the rest of you, all of you
pull out your paint
and your crayons
and start defacing each other.
Right now!
I thought you little fuckers
liked tattoos.
Come on!
let's start painting!
That, my friend,
is how you button a scene-
classic john wayne
don't mess with america.
You're a true patriot.
You know who you sound like?
Jack Nicholson.
Anybody ever tell you that?
Really?
Now we're ready
for the third act.
I know how to
get the diamonds.
Do you know how to fire a gun?
Hello.
My name is Cletis Tout.
I have reason to believe
that my life is in danger.
You'll never guess who just
walked into the 14th precinct.
Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Have they seen the tape?
Evidently, he didn't
mention the tape.
He claims to have
seen it all
with his own two eyes.
I'll kill that shit
and fuck his whole family!
Cops are going to
want to question you.
What do I do?
You do nothing.
We need to get to Tout.
So what do you think?
Got an awful lot
of the right information.
Rowdy Virago?
Pretty amazing charge.
Would you like to
take a little ride?
No, you can
leave the birds.
Mr. Tout, there are
four corpses here.
Please point out the woman
you saw Rowdy Virago kill.
This is the girl.
Iet the record state
that Mr. Tout identified
Merrill Candide.
Dr. Savian.
Gentlemen.
This is Cletis Tout.
He just named a suspect
in our triple homicide.
Nice to see a man like you
these days.
Nice to be seen.
Mr. Tout, you
recognize this man?
Uh... no.
What makes you think
someone's trying
to kill you, Mr. Tout?
I got a little greedy
with the wrong bunch.
Instead of coming
to you guys first
I went to the source.
Now what exactly is it
you do for a living,
Mr. Tout?
I'm a photojournalist.
I take pictures.
Compromising pictures.
Huh, sounds more
like extortion to me.
Hey, guys, I'm going
to get a coffee.
Anybody need any?
- No.
- I'm fine.
Meet you outside.
Okay.
Oh, get down!
Go, go, go!
All right, here's
where we're at.
I just talked
to the da.
We're going to put you
up in a safe house.
That place off crown.
Rosedale Mansion?
No, no, no safe house.
It's too dangerous.
They can get to me there.
You got a better suggestion?
I want to go to jail.
I don't get it. Who goes
to jail unless they have to?
This guy's on the make.
I can smell it. It's too smart.
What jail did he say
he wanted to go to?
Cleary brand.
That minimum security?
Mm-hmm.
Well, maybe he's on the story.
Check in with cleary brand,
all right?
See if they got anybody
important inside.
Delaney, I want you
to find out everything
about our mr. Tout,
all right?
Go to his house,
talk to his neighbors.
Horst, go to the tv show
he works for.
Raff and I will
work the streets
see if we can pin
this on Virago.
About the only good thing
I can think of
is if he's in jail,
he ain't going nowhere.
It was agreed upon
that I should be given
no special privileges
the thought being I would draw
no undue attention to myself.
I made only two requests:
that I be able to keep my birds
with me at all times
and that I be allowed
to keep up with my gardening.
I told them it leveled my head.
Now why do you suppose
he's digging there?
I don't know...
but I'm so goddamned
intrigued by this guy
I'd just about let him
drop a shovel anywhere.
The plan was perfect.
I had an answer for everything.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
- Any luck?
- No.
Oh, me neither, man.
I just can't
put a finger on Tout.
Nobody can.
You know, the guy thinks
he's a secret agent.
That journal show
he works for-
you know what they call him?
Bells and whistles.
Costumes, face paint, mustaches,
anything to get the story.
Nobody knows who he is.
I don't think they want to.
Evidently our mr. Tout's
a real piece of work.
Something's not right.
It's like we're getting
all the right answers
but from the wrong
stool pigeons.
Do me a favor, all right?
Call cleary brand,
pull Tout's prints.
We're going to cross-check him
against the FBI computer.
Come on.
Tout.
You got a visitor.
You'll only have
a few minutes.
Visiting hours are only
until 4:00 p.m.
Any gross conduct
and the visit
will be terminated.
There are families present.
You may hold hands,
you may kiss.
Once again, we ask discretion
with regards to this act.
If you wish
to terminate the visit
just wave
and I'll be over presently.
So what do you got for me?
Union Station.
The locker
south of the clock.
The key is
with the blind man
at the paper stand
under the clock.
He's a friend of mine.
He's there
from 6:00 in the morning
Till 10:00 at night.
And the, uh... the diamonds?
Uh, the gladstone hotel.
Your room's been taken
care of for the month.
They're in a small box
behind the tv.
You'll find them just
next to the cable port.
You have a plan?
A plan?
I just want to get
the heck out of here.
You know, you should probably do
the same thing.
I mean, get out of the city.
Already taken care of.
Thought I'd try the train.
I guess it's, uh,
the romantic in me.
First class to canada.
10:00 p.m.
The three of us leave tonight.
"The three of us"?
The birds.
Oh. Right.
That's too bad.
I mean, uh, I was growing kind
of fond of the little one.
Well... if you
break out in time
I'm... sure she'd love
to say good-bye.
Your eyes are, uh...
they're green.
I could've sworn
they were brown.
Um, your picture...
sorry, folks.
Kiss her and say good-bye.
Time to go.
Tell tripp I need to see him.
The plan had gone off
without a hitch.
In retrospect, I guess
I really only made one mistake:
Tess.
I was in love with her,
and I let her go.
What, does my desk
look like a lounge to you?
You got nothing to do?
The FBI called.
Your print search is in.
They're moving him
to Rosedale Mansion.
They got him at
Rosedale Mansion.
Call Critical Jim.
There's a diner
across the street
from the hotel.
You go there just in case.
You don't do anything
unless you hear from me.
You understand?
Yeah.
And don't improvise.
- What if the guy...?
- Don't!
You'll fuck it up!
You two cheese dicks
couldn't improvise a fart
after eating
a three-bean salad.
Now get the fuck
out of here!
Tripp.
I hope you're sitting down
because you won't believe this.
What is it?
Well, our print search came in
and your mr. Tout hasn't been
behind a video camera
for the past four years.
He's been in front of one.
Under surveillance at a little
maximum security prison
in North Carolina.
You don't say?
Iieutenant tripp
may I introduce you
to trevor Finch-
escaped con.
Hey, Finch.
Yeah?
We'll bring him in.
Iook, you don't want me.
You've got three murders
to deal with.
One of them's a friend of mine.
I've got enough evidence
to help you bust these guys.
You just got to hear me out.
Iook at this.
It's limp toast.
Iook at this.
Stuff's fuckin' filthy.
What are you doing?
It's filthy fuck.
It's a fork.
It ain't jewelry.
How'd you like to take a ride
down to union station?
I got to tell you, Finch.
That's one interesting
line of bullshit.
Break out of jail
and fall right into a hit.
I just can't wait to see
where it goes from here.
Oh, what's the name of that
Burt Reynold's picture
with the banjo?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
The one with that retarded kid.
He was good, that guy.
Yeah, he was good. He was good.
"Deliverance."
Cletis Sherman Tout.
Born october 12, 1967.
Christ, it's almost perfect.
One question:
why jail?
I'm comfortable there.
When somebody's trying
to kill you
you go where you feel safe.
You keep your mouth shut
there isn't a safer place
than jail.
And the birds?
The old man's homing pigeons.
Can't really track a bird,
you know?
I had a friend on the outside
trying to get me
out of the country.
Your sexuality is in question.
You decide you're going
to hit for the other side.
You want yourself
some man meat.
I understand that.
But wouldn't you wait
for Burt Reynolds
to come downriver?
Ah. Yeah, you're right.
I mean, who says
to themselves
"hey, I want to bang
that fat guy"?
Exactly.
I think you have
to approach this
from the mountain man's
point of view.
It's a self-esteem issue really.
If you lose your job-
you're not feeling good
about yourself-
you generally
settle for less.
You look for the weaker members
of the herd.
Yeah. Yeah, you hump
the one with the limp.
That's good.
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.
I'm sorry.
That ain't right.
You know what kills me?
Virago's going to walk.
Walk?
He murdered that poor girl,
and you can't make it stick-
tape or no tape.
What are you talking about?
We both know the system.
You know why justice wears
a blindfold-
so she doesn't have to watch.
I mean, justice isn't blind,
it's embarrassed.
I've been in trouble
with the law
ever since I can remember.
Made some mistakes,
but I paid my dues.
Never did anything
to hurt anybody.
You got three bodies
in that morgue.
You're going to get your tape-
your hard evidence
to put Virago away, but once
his attorneys discover
that Tout was a fabrication,
they'll bury it.
I mean, you created Tout-
what other evidence
did you doctor?
I can create any image I want
on a computer.
That's what I went to jail for
in the first place.
And you know they're going
to figure that out.
Wouldn't you rather not
have to deal
with any of that at all?
I'm not the bad guy here.
Let me disappear.
Two months, I would
have made parole anyway.
You take the tape,
you can make it stick.
I only need you
to do one thing-
I need you for once in your life
to look the other way.
Tripp.
Russ, you're not
going to believe
what's on this tape.
Call Horst.
Have him send a
couple of units down
to the empire social club.
Send a cruiser to pick me up.
Outside.
I'll be in front of the diner
across the street.
Hey, listen, Tout...
I'm going to run down
to the diner for some coffee.
Can I get you something
while I'm out?
Not a thing.
Number eight.
They were all there,
the diamonds, all of them.
Tess had left me her half.
She got what she wanted.
She got her picture.
You've all volunteered
for a mission
which gives you
just three ways to go.
You can foul up in training
and be shipped back here
for immediate
execution of sentence
Or you can foul up in combat
in which case I will personally
blow your brains out.
Or you can do as you're told
in which case,
you just might get by.

"T" as in Tracy,
"K" as in... Kubrick.
You've got 90 minutes,
or I let him go.
Got it.
What's the word?
He's got him there
at the Gladstone.
So now what?
I wire the money,
he waits for it to clear.
It's standard.
Rowdy Virago,
you're under arrest
for the murder
of Merrill Candide.
Cuff him,
read him his rights.
You have the right
to remain silent.
What's the problem?
It's been 90 minutes.
Why hasn't he killed him yet?
I don't know.
Got to go.
We have a major problem.
We have no ending.
I mean, it's a major flaw.
I love the moral message.
But the two things
that the moviegoer
is going to cry out for
are missing.
- The moviegoer?
- The moviegoer-
John and Jane Q. Public.
First, they're going to want you
to get back with the girl.
But you screwed that up.
And second, they're going
to want some gunplay.
And I can't shoot you,
you're the good guy.
We got to get you out of here
you got to find that girl,
and you got to kill somebody.
What was the room number again?
Eight. Fuck. Number eight.
Eight, I got it.
Number eight!
I got it!
You can kill me.
That's not going to work.
You have got to disappear.
We need to figure out...
this is perfect, perfect.
What? What?!
What are you doing?
Two guys are coming
through that door.
I want you to kill them.
- Who?
- Just a couple of guys.
The guy with the hair,
he's got the gun.
I'm not killing anybody.
You're going to kill them
otherwise I'm going to kill you.
Is that what you want?
Great, it's a festival piece!
Jesus!
Shoot 'em!
Shoot!
No!
What kind of a hero are you?
Tess.
Cut me loose, cut me loose.
What time is it?
It's 9:30.
You got about 30 minutes, buddy.
Come on.
Fix yourself up.
Look, you're the leading man.
Straighten up a little bit.
Listen to me,
trains to canada
Leave out of Union Station
On tracks one and three.
What about the diamonds?
Well, I really only need one.
Ah, well, maybe
a few more
so we can get started.
Buy a big house.
You got 29 minutes.
"I love you.
"You belong to me.
I know people
don't belong to people."
"Of course they do."
