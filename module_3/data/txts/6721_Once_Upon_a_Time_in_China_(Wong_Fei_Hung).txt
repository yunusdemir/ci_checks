Look, look! They are shooting at us.
Fire!
- Oh! This is a dragon dance!
- Return to your post!
Drums!
Master Wong, be careful
of the ship's cannons.
Want to come up? - Yes!
Give me the tail!
"Bravery Soaring."
"Magnanimity Overflowing"
Look, Wong...
More foreign ships
are anchoring in our docks.
Britain has Hong Kong,
Portugal has Macau,
Russia occupies Heilongjiang.
Our country is divided
and I'm sent to Vietnam...
to fight the French.
How'll the Vietnamese react to this
plaque that says "Our Land Our People"
- Someone come!
- Yes, your Excellency!
Take it down! - Yes!
Quick! - Wait a minute!
Excellency, the Govt.
Changes its policies often...
You could be called back soon.
The Govùs factionalised,
and has cut my forces.
I think that whilst I'm gone...
the men that remain here
will be dismissed.
You're the chief trainer of my Black Flag Army.
I hope you'll organize them into a local militia.
So when China is under foreign attack,
they can defend it.
Master Wong...
Rise!
Excellency, don't worry!
I hope you'll be back soon.
Wong Fei Hung!
The unequal treaties
are written on this fan.
When you see it, you see me.
When I return,
I hope the treaties will be erased.
Pork buns!
Halleluja!
Here it is!
Halleluja!
What are you talking about?
The town's full of foreigners.
How clever of you
to do business with them.
Couldn't succeed in China,
so went to England.
Take a photo
with Old Chu's bird.
The bird will truly be honoured.
Don't mention it. You take one too!
Thank you very much.
Master Wong!
How are you, everyone?
Fei Hung!
Grand uncle, long time no see. You look great.
Thank you! Fei Hung,
see who's with me?
Master Wong! Had tea? Many are expecting you.
Aunt 13? - Fei Hung!
She wants to shake your hand.
Foreigners shake hands.
Let me introduce you. This is Joanna.
How do you do?
What do...
She's asking: How do you do?
Say thank you ah. Thank you!
Oh, kill you. You're welcome!
Fei Hung, take a photo with the bird.
Okay!
Sit...
Fei Hung, taking photos is easy.
How?
Look there.
Don't move... Or the photo with be no good.
Ready, 1, 2, 3!
What happened?
Iùs boiling water!
- How are you? Are you hurt?
- I'm alright!
This foreigner's game is too dangerous.
Too much powder.
You told me not to move!
Are you alright?
Grand Uncle, I'm glad you asked me to come...
or you coulÔve ended up like the bird.
Thaùs right.
Old Chu!...
I'll go back to England in a few days.
Yee was in England...
but insisted on coming back.
At least she won't mix with those foreigners.
- Please watch over her for me.
- Watch over her?
Old Chu, answer me, you're frightening me.
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
Anyone here?
I'm looking for Master Wong.
Who is it? Whaùs up?
- I'm from May County.
- M... ay... May... May.
I'm Leung Foon. I want Master Wong to teach me.
He... - He's not here?
I... I am... - You? You are?
- Wong... Master Wong...
- You're Master Wong?
No... yes! - Ah, so you are Master Wong?
I'm a herdeman. I practiced Kung Fu with my cow.
The cow kicked me. Please look at my arm.
Good!
Not this one. This one.
Master Wong. I hurt my arm...
Why you wrapped my leg?
Oh... too... late... now!
Iùs stiff, Master. Why's it stiff?
Are you... alright?
Master, perhaps you want
to teach me Kung Fu?
No...
No? Not good enough?
OK? I'll do my best. Can attack. Can defend.
Not a bad stand.
Stupid!
Still not good? I get it!
I'll roll a few more for you.
Whaùs this noise?
Who is he? - Master is teaching me Kung Fu!
Buck Teeth So is teaching you Kung Fu?
Who are you? - Buck Teeth So!
You are not Master Wong? - Stupid!
Buck Teeth So, who're you?
He is Master Wong's disciple.
And who are you?
I'm also Master Wong's disciple,
Kai what happened to your arm and leg?
Don't ask. I have to get back to the Theater.
I'm going.
Have to go before he binds my other side.
Foon, have you finished mending
the hole on the roof?
The show will start soon!
I'm here to act, and you make me fix the roof.
Iùs not right and I'm scared.
If you don't do it how do I know you can act?
When I'm famous,
I'll make you do it everyday.
Whaùre you doing? A somersault?
Whaùre you doing?
I thought it was the ship's cannon.
It was only thunder.
If iùs true,
we'll all go and work at gold mines in America.
We don't have to toil here.
Don't move! Or you'll spoil it.
Are you ready?
Foreign woman speaking Chinese?
China will be occupied by foreigners soon.
Wait for me!
1, 2. - Wait for me!
Wait for you?
Iùs stuck!
Foon, where the hell are you?
I'm changing!
Come out quick, don't be lazy!
Foon, you brag about your Kung Fu skills.
All you can do is climb roofs and fix things.
Broke the stage with a somersault.
Can you do it?
Miss, the clothes that got dirty...
have been washed.
I asked someone to iron them.
Thank you, Boss!
Do you need fresh water?
No, I'm fine.
Who's it?
You didn't...
I'll invite you to our next new show.
Good, Boss!
Take care, the road is slippery! - Bye!
A Chinese pretending to be a foreigner!
Miss, umbrella!
Sir, no need to rush.
Come up, there are lots of girls here.
It takes so long.
Don't move!
A gunshot, whaùs the matter? Who's it?
Master! Master!
Master! - Iùs Wing. Open the door.
Master! Master!
You opened the door just in time,
or I'd have to break it.
We'll have tea sometime, my treat.
Excuse me!
- Kai, who's been shot?
- Iùs the greengrocer.
Who shot him?
I don't know. Ask Master.
Buck Teeth So,
if not for me you'd break something.
Por... ky... Porky...
My name's Wing. Call me Porky and I'll get fat.
Back for so long and still don't speak Chinese.
Por... ky... - Bu... ck... Tee... th.
So, get me the medicine.
You don't speak Chinese,
how can you handle medicine?
What are you quarrelling about?
Master, I'm teaching him how to be Chinese.
- Give me "The Magic Healer".
- "The Magic Healer".
3, they're all 3 characters.
Master, I can't read!
You laugh at those who don't speak Chinese?
Come, So.
"Powder for 7 Cuts", "Blood-Clotting Powder".
So is from America.
Studied medicine there
learns bonesetting here.
Then he's quite good.
Master, here's the water.
Finally.
Take a rest, you'll be fine.
Master, this is a bullet from a shotgun.
Leùs bandage him first.
Many ships,
and too many colours in the flags.
So he boarded...
the wrong ship and got shot.
The "Westernization Movement" is now underway.
When there's trouble, we Chinese suffer.
Can we Chinese survive?
The Manchurians have taken our land.
Now they join the foreigners
and sell out our country.
Brothers of the Local Militia, leùs act!
- Ca... ca... calm down!
- You lecturing me?
Por... ky...
Watch your tongue, can me Big Brother.
Wing! - Master!
You're too rash. Keep out of this.
This is a matter of life or death.
I must sort this out
with the authorities.
Otherwise how can we Chinese
live here anymore?
Excuse me sir, you would like something?
So, you explain it to the captain. - Yes!
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson
of Sino Pacific Corporation...
and General Wickens of the British Forces
have made an appointment with us.
And I presume they should have
reserved a table for this matter.
So we can discuss this matter more leisurely.
This is my master, Wong Fei Hung.
We'd be gratefull if you'd show us the table.
How... come... your... English... is... so... fluent?
This way please.
Why so many swords and daggers on the table?
Excuse me sir, your menu, sir.
So, ask them to bring us some dim sum.
Foon, your job is to check tickets today.
I'm here to learn acting not check tickets,
doesn't sound right.
Can't help it.
All the others have gone to America.
America? Gold mining?
Boss, is there really gold there?
Would I lie to you?
Iùs all the newspaper.
I'd go too if I didn't have to run this place.
Newspaper? What newspaper?
They're here for protection money.
You haven't paid?
Yes I have, but these thugs are from Shaho.
How dare they venture out of their patch?
If I deal with them, they've had it!
Yes!
What are you doing?
I know you know wome Kung Fu.
Didn't you say you want to make it big?
Here's your chance.
I didn't mean that.
Boss, I'm not good at Kung Fu.
They've all come here just to honour you.
I'm being set up. Stop!
Boss, open the gate! Boss, open up. Quick!
No daytime show. No ticket.
I'll come another time.
Hey kid, come down!
Damn. I came a long way, and there's no show.
Next time I won't bother.
I know you're Foon. Here to talk with me?
No, I'm here to check tickets.
We're here to collect protection money.
They said you're a good fighter.
You're brave... facing us alone.
You've got guts!
You're kidding.
Let me buy you a gift.
I'll visit you guys in a minute.
No need.
No need for gifts,
just a hand will do.
Chop my hand off? Chop your mother's head off!
Don't go.
Okay, iùs too many against one.
Leùs fix a time and place for a duel.
Don't bother, leùs do it right here and now.
Get him! Stop!
Someone's fighting in the Theater.
Yes, with knives!
Don't run! Stop! Stop! Get him!
Excuse us, excuse us!
Whaùs happening? - Fighting!
Fight out there,
we're doing business here. Out! Out!
What is it, pal?
They demand protection money,
and want to challenge me...
But they're too many against one.
Kill that dumb fool!
- Armageddon over there. Go and look!
- Where?
Thaùs Porky, Wong's disciple.
Never met him.
Porky, for your master's sake...
I'll let you go today.
So you're Master Wong's disciple?
I am!
I saw the junior doctor at Po Chi Lam.
That Chinese American.
Foon! - What?
I'm not kidding,
if you don't bring a hand to Shaho...
I'll make you disappear from Fa Shan.
Leùs to Shaho. - Go!
Chicken out because Wong's disciple is here?
You want a hand? Take this hock!
Big brother, what shall we do?
Do? Leùs tear them apart!
Brother Wing. This one's for him!
Iùs free, I'm not doing business today.
You stinky boy...
Shaho's stupid, Shaho's dumb...
Give me any trouble, I'll beat you to death.
Have some puddings, enjoy the show.
A bean curd pudding.
Take that! Hold it!
Add a little water, make a perfect brew.
Boiling water? Who threw it? Find him.
Go up and see!
Who dropped boiling water? Out! - Go!
Old Fool, it must be you.
Not me. I've been eating pork buns.
Pork buns?
And that, Your Excellency,
is the position of Her Majesty's Government.
May I suggest that we leave it at that?
Your Government is most generous
Wong Fei Hung!
This is General Wickens of the British forces.
Mr. Jackson of the Sino Pacific Corporation.
They've kindly agreed not to press charges.
So stop making demands for the greengrocer.
This is unjust. The people are outraged.
Outraged? Wong,
you have no authority.
You are just a civilian.
Who are you to negotiate?
The Westernization Movements is on
relationships with foreigners...
Iùs better to keep the peace.
These rolls are made from our flour.
So you appreciate western food?
The foreigners draw boundaries here...
and set up forbidden areas.
If we fight each other...
and defer to them,
then soon we'll lose the flour to make rolls.
You're friends with Lau
of the Black Flag Army.
But he doesn't follow orders
from Central Govt.
I'm sent here to watch you.
I intend to set an example.
Are you alright?
What is all this?
Master, iùs our Local Militia.
Master Wong!
Stop them!
Stop.
Don't fight!
Kai, I told you to tell them not to fight!
Told you not to fight!
Put down the weapons! Still fighting?
Don't move.
I expect you'd have an explanation
for this disgraceful intrusion.
Good day!
General Wickens.
You're quite good! - Of course!
Big Brother, that looks like Master Wong.
Master Wong.
We are many, leùs take him on!
Don't fight!
He hit you? Don't fight!
Don't fight, Kai!
Don't fight... - I told you not to fight!
- I said don't fight!
- You're still fighting?
Really stop? They're coming. Let me go!
Big Brother, are you alright?
Who just kicked me? - Don't know!
Have you taken them on? - Yes, we have!
Carry on!
Buck Teeth So! - Stupid!
I'm so sorry!
So, tell them
they've made a mistake.
Mr. Jackson! - No need to explain.
If China had no forbidden areas,
we'd be unsafe.
Master, this alien can speak Chinese.
Still attacking?
Don't call me a alien "Chinese Devil"!
You listen, we're doing business with you.
If we don't use our heads,
how do we make big money?
Otherwise you'll get yourself...
in big trouble.
Goodby Chinamen! Leùs go!
Shoot whoever resists. - Run! Run!
The authorities are here!
Leùs get outta here!
Stop! Don't move!
Drop your weapons.
Why're the Local Militia fighting?
Where's Porky? Gone?
Don't move, or else we'll shoot.
Wong, this area's rented by the foreigners...
The Local Militia make trouble here.
You're the Head,
how do you explain it?
Excellency,
they were Govt. Trained.
So they would not act without a reason.
Reason? What the Govt. Discards, you retain.
The Local Militia is directly
under us from now on.
Excellency...
Tell them report to City Hall!
Or get arrested. - Excellency...
Master Wong will pay for all the damages.
Yes, Your Excellency!
Beware of fire. Beware of thieves.
Master, I've lost my appetite.
I hear this was started by a gang from Shaho.
City Hall now requires us to report in.
Will they hold us in custody?
Master!
Sit! City Hall's authorized to look into this.
If iùs a set-up,
they'll find out the truth.
So, leùs eat...
Until the verdict is know,
this'll be our last meal together.
Leùs eat.
Listen, "Local Militia", prepare to eat.
Pick up vegetables! Eat rice! Swallow!
Aunt 13!
Don't worry,
the Local Militia will be fine.
Iùs late, why don't you sleep?
I want to take your measurements for a suit.
A suit?
Why would I want to wear a western suit?
Iùs for when you go abroad.
Aunt 13, is the West so wonderful?
Why do we have to learn from the West?
They invented things like the steam engine
and many other things.
Their science is developed far beyond us.
If we don't learn we'll get left behind.
When you get the chance, tell me more...
about how great the outside world is.
Aunt 13, if iùs so great,
why'd you come back?
There's something here they haven't got.
What haven't they got?
People!
People I want to see
I was away 2 years,
but my heart was here.
In fact you were always in my thoughts
You are very sweet.
Aunt 13! - Whaùs wrong?
I thought... No, iùs nothing!
Fei Hung, you and I are relatives by name,
not by blood.
We were raised together,
don't call me Aunt 13.
Whaùll I call you? You're senior to me.
I'll do it!
Whaùs this? Doesn't matter!
Doesn't matter?
Of course it does, one must be precise.
Chinese shouldn't wear suits.
Chinese are Chinese,
Westerners Western.
There will be railways
and a telegraph company soon.
Everything will change.
China will change will the world.
You're right.
Western guns and ships are here.
Everything is changing.
Changing. What will we change into?
I appreciate your gift, but you keep it.
When all Chinese wear suits,
I'll wear one.
Come greet me the God of Fortune!
Here I am, the God of Fortune!
Get away! Get away, Jesuit!
Fortune?
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune.
Come greet the God of Fortune!
Sir, we already bought the God of Fortune!
Did you buy Fortune from me, or the old one?
He's now dead in a well. Want to see him?
Just buy a new one!
If I pay him, what happens
when the old God comes?
- Sir, do you need a hand?
- You want to join us!
- Yes sir! Life is so tough right now!
- Give me the money.
So that we can take care of you.
Sir, don't clean me out,
give me a chance.
- And who'll give me a chance?
- Give me of it!
Take advantage of people in these hard times?
Iùs Master Wong!
You're from Shaho?
Come with me to City Hall.
Protect me!
Stabbing your own people?
Get going! Run!
Quick! Get away, quick!
Run! Where've you good-for-nothings gone?
Go to hell!
Damn, iùs high!
Run
Alright! How wonderful!
Did you see Master Wong do his
"Shadowless Kick"?
Did you see it? - No, I didn't.
Everyone, this guy extorts money.
I'm taking him to City Hall.
Please come and be witness.
He's impressive,
did an amazing jump.
Boss, he wants protection money from you.
Come with me to be a witness.
Witness?
And live my days worrying
like the Theater boss?
You were practising Kung Fu in there,
I saw no fighting.
In America, people have to walk carefully.
Because they can trip on gold.
How's that possible? - There's more.
Wash your face in the river, you'll find gold.
Is it really so wonderful?
Of course it is!
Just one visiùs
worth a lifetime of work in China.
Come, have some leaflets, one for everyone.
Don't said I didn't inform you
People there wear dark glasses day and night.
Your eyes will get hurt
You can't pick up gold
if you're blind.
Lost sheep, GoÔs Kingdom belongs to you.
You're promoting America too?
Material things are transient.
Only Jesus is the truth.
You should follow him and experience life.
I arrested a criminal today,
will Jesus be my witness?
Beware of me. Beware of thieves.
Big Brother!
- Big Brother, are you over there?
- I'm here!
Get ready!
Master! - How are you?
You crazy? Fanning when iùs so windy outside.
City Hall locked up the Local Militia?
Won't release them till the suspecùs caught.
Master!
I can't be a witness
because I'm a suspect.
They even let Hung of Shaho go.
When will the Local Militia be released?
When someone offers to be a witness.
Master, how about Foon?
Foon? Do you know him? - Yes.
You must be in this.
Whaùs you hiding?
I... Master, you don't always trust me.
So, I...
I what? Speak!
Mas... Mas... Master... The... There...
Fire! - Calm down, So. Don't panic!
Master!
So!...
Master, what shall we do?
The arrows came from the pharmacy's roof.
So, Master is coming to save you!
Never mind me. Gather... the valuables!
Kai, get your weapon. We'll take them on.
Wing, put out the fire. I'm off.
Alone?
Damn!
So! Here!
Goddamn steps!
His Excellency's fan? It is!
Wow, the rooftop fire is big!
Iùs... even big... bigger down here!
Someone's on the roof. - Shoot him!
Iùs Master Wong. Go! Run!
Po Chi Lam is on fire!
Don't forget the camera, hurry up!
Po Chi Lam will be no more if iùs burnt.
What are you doing, Aunt 13?
Taking a photo of Po Chi Lam.
A photo! Your butt is on fire.
You're blocking the sign.
A little more, I can't see you.
Should we wait for Master?
The... roof... is... is on fire!
So, look this way!
Kai, shift a little to the right.
I thought I had it with me.
But I was taking pictures of Po Chi Lam.
You're just like a foreign hag...
caring only for trivia.
Don't ever bring this into the Clinic again.
Or I'll throw it away.
His Excellency the Governor is here!
Wong Fei Hung, you open Schools,
triad societies...
divide up the town and run illegal business.
You diÔt obey the law.
Now other triads take revenge...
The burning of Po Chi Lam is your own fault.
Iùs time to mend your ways!
Excellency, Schools are not triad societies.
If the authority...
labels martial arts illegal,
then our grand tradition...
will be lost.
So when attacked,
how'll we defend ourselves?
Is that what you can courting peace?
Can't save your Po Chi Lam...
and you dare lecturing me!
Iùs City Hall's job to investigate the fire.
You tell me, who did it?
I don't know.
You don't know? You're covering something.
Big Brother!
Wing, what are you doing? Go in!
Master!
Can I come in?
Foreigners... why you come here?
Wing! - Master!
Go on like this, and you stop calling me Master.
Don't go.
You must hold something against Fei Hung.
You can tell me.
Wong Fei Hung. I know who set Po Chi Lam on fire.
I can be your witness.
Check if anyone's from Shaho.
Hey, are you from Shaho. - No!
Not the way you talk.
There's so many people here!
Big Brother, seems City Hall may get you.
Goddamn! That Jesuit musùve told on me.
Should you go and hide in Shaho?
No way!
We're afraid of City Hall,
they're afraid of the foreigners.
So leùs find us an influential foreigners!
Wait for me.
We want to speak to Mr. Jackson.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Whaùs going on down there?
Damn, we don't speak English. Try harder.
Please,
please let us in to see Mr. Jackson.
We all want to see Mr. Jackson.
Jackson...
I'd better have a cigar
I don't like cigars.
If I keep a dog, iùll guard my house.
You are wanted by City Hall.
What good is it if I help you?
I'm not afraid of being arrested.
But I am afraid that without a leader,
my brothers' talent will go to waste.
You come all this way to make money,
send so many Chinese to America.
Why don't I give you some women to ship over?
Isn't it a better idea?
No, we don't allow
the labourers to have wives.
Don't allow them to have descendents.
Otherwise they'd stay there forever.
I don't mean wives, but whores.
I have as many as you want.
Iùs Master Wong,
who always interferes.
Dare you kill him for me?
Master Wong? - Yes...
- I'll invite him to the show tomorrow.
- Yes, yes, yes!
Then he'll be killed by me...
or the authorities.
Do you hear noise?
Something just dropped into the water.
Wing, City Hall's after the Shaho Gang.
Foon, where were you?
I've to go back to the Theater. Come with me.
Wait, let me lock up first.
OK!
Hey, come out first. - Oh right!
This is Wing,
the one who can Sove of any problems.
Master Wong's disciple. Welcome!
I won't see the show for free. I'll check tickets.
I like gate duty.
- Thank you indeed.
- Never mind, never mind.
Ticket. Have you got tickets?
Those with tickets, get in.
Do you have tickets?
Ticket?
Do you know who I am? Look at the sign.
He's Wonder Ho, I'm White Gent.
And I'm Wing! No ticket, go!
The show's starting and you tell us to leave?
- OK, we'll go, just don't regret it!
- We'll go! We'll go!
Got tickets?
Brother Wing, leùs go in.
No hurry, the actors aren't there yet.
Thank you so much.
Have you seen Wonder Ho and White Gent?
They tried to barge in,
I turned them away.
What? They're the actors.
Who will act then?
Then we don't have a show.
You stay here.
I'll go and fetch them. - Tickets...
Master has come, you help me.
I've to go to toilet.
Excuse me.
Mr. Jackson, let me introduce you to
the Reverend Father.
Please to meet you, sir.
General Wickens, please take a seat.
Can't imagine you'd be invited by the foreigners.
Please!
Aunt 13! - Master Wong!
Why so detached?
Relatives must respect
the rule of seniority.
Alright, leùs just watch the show!
Please!...
Wing, we're in trouble.
Master's hre. I don't want to watch the show.
The actors are gone. You're going.
Whaùll I do?
I can sing. - So what?
I can act a little. Leùs go!
You dare sing on stage...
in front of Master?
Fool, who will recognize us with make up on?
OK, leùs take a chance. Come backstage.
Lucky you get us
or the show'd be cancelled.
Amazing that you could recognize me...
Isn't that Porky?
Who's Wing? Leùs go. - Go.
The White Snake is now a Fat Snake.
Porky! Porky!
Hey, Porky's changed profession.
Hey, where'll we get our pork from now?
Wing, again!
Nonsense!
I got him to do it,
don't blame him.
Pack up and
never come back.
Alright, Brother Wing,
I'll join you in the pork business.
Watch out!
Stoop down!
Seal all passageways!
Lead the foreigners out.
Yes!
Iùs fighting outside.
Foon, it must be the Shaho Gang.
Go after them!
Aunt 13!
Stop it!
The Troops. - Yes, sir.
Get ready.
Don't shoot at the audience.
Gun shot! My god! - Don't shoot.
No!
Son...
You fool.
Shoot him.
No!
Limestone powder. Close your eyes.
My eyes...
Don't get up.
- Master Wong?
- Don't care about him, leùs go.
Protect His Excellency!
Come on!
Gun!
Hide away.
Aunt 13, take the gun and hide with the reverend.
They came for me. Don't stay here!
Reverend Father!
Master, take the pole!
Master, I'll help you!
The floor's too thin.
Master, I'll help you! - Who are you?
Help Aunt 13, I don't need help.
Leave her alone.
Tiger, use your gun. You idiot, shoot him dead.
Shoot them.
No.
Reverend Father.
Go.
Father... - Reverend Father.
Wing, come and protect Aunt 13.
They've gone backstage!
Come up here.
Damn it.
Why ambush me?
Iùs you who ambushed me?
Foon? - He's Foon?
Iùs dangerous here, there're killers inside.
Question him, I'm going to have a look.
Foon, whaùre you doing?
How would I know?
He's been hitting me ever
since he came in.
Foon! - Don't move!
You say don't move, but you still hit me?
Leùs sort this out before hitting anyone.
Run, run!
Master Wong, don't move!
Your Excellency. - You shut up!
Excellency, they left something.
What? "Glory to Local Militia.
End to foreigners"?
Weren't all the...
Local Militia arrested?
How many have you given shelter to?
Your Excellency. I've been set up.
Don't believe him.
Arrest these Shaho thugs.
What Shaho thugs?
Thaùs the second time you've hit me.
Find out the truth before you lay blame.
The truth?
He's taking protection money.
What? My Master takes protection money?
Yes! Iùs him!
Master Wong, isn't he from Shaho?
Whaùs Shaho? The Yellow River?
You don't need to explain.
City Hall will soon arrest...
your other members.
Iùs time to arrest the head first.
I'm going to arrest you first...
and close your Po Chi Lam.
How'll you make trouble now?
A lot of people were hurt at the theater,
let me tend to them,
then I'll go with you.
Alright, go ahead.
You'll be guarded.
If anything happens...
I'll arrest and execute you right here.
Don't move. You're bleeding.
So, fetch the medicine. - Ok!
Go away. Can't you see the eviction notice?
That doesn't give you permission to steal.
Bring them back!
You dare hit us? - Go away!
Don't you have anything better to do?
Master, they are stealing,
I'm stopping them.
So what? Wanna fight?
I'll fight with you.
OK, leùs go!
No! I mean I'll fight you!
Master, I fight you?
Where's you like hitting?
Is it here? Here?
You want me arrested sooner?
- If not, don't block me saving people.
- Master!
You're so manipulative. You used us.
We'll arrest you, if you stand in our way.
He's smart,
escapes arrest this way.
Come hit me? So restrained!
Mr. Cheng!
Still bleeding. Fetch me the "Last Aid"!
"Last Aid"!
He's dead. Tell his family.
So...
Fei Hung!
Whaùs the tattoo?
Iùs Arabic numerals. "JACKSON"
Is it his ship's name?
Don't worry. I'm Wong Fei Hung.
You're hurt. If you move,
you'll tear the wound.
You're Master Wong? Help me!
Get up. Where're you from?
America! - America?
We crossed seas;
denied medicine when ill.
Many were thrown overboard.
In America,
we were branded like pigs.
We were cheated...
by the Chinese dealers here.
We signed contracts, paid for food and the trip.
Paid for so many things.
Those who tried to escape were caught and killed.
I came back to China.
I... I... Master Wong...
Don't worry, you're back in China now.
Let me see if
I can find your family.
Don't think too much.
Kai! Keep secret his contract
with the foreigners.
Or City Hall will arrest him.
I understand.
Going to America's better than
staying here.
Don't miss out! Come... Take a look!
You want one?
Giong to America? How? Take one.
You want one, too?
The same America as in the newspaper?
Right! If you want to go, pay an exit tax...
pay your passage, rental, blanket and food.
Get a 3 year contract.
You mean it costs 2 years salary?
Haven't you got money? - No, I haven't.
Then don't even think about it.
Shove off!
You want one, iùs full of gold there.
Someone's fighting there!
Duel? Leùs go and watch it. Go, go.
Don't go, don't go!
You dare show off...
in front of my house...
and hit my disciple.
Whaùs your name?
Master Yim.
I'm matchless in 19 provinces with my "7 Sabres".
You're a guest, so I'll let you thrust 3 times.
Then prepare!
No. 2!
Still No.2 and you already draw your sword?
You will get killed. Leùs forget it!
Don't go.
Hit me in the back?
"Iron Vest Kung Fu"!
I've let you thrust 3 times. Admit defeat!
There must be a way to beat him.
What are you following me for?
My name is Foon. I'm from May County.
There're lots of gangs in this town.
My Kung Fu is poor.
I'm often harassed.
Can't even make a living.
Please take me as your disciple.
Whaùs the point of being a Kung Fu expert?
Can't make a living.
Master, are you hungry?
You take shelter.
I'll think of something.
Good! - Give me a drumstick!
Good food, we don't eat bad food.
Gentlemen, come inside!
The soup's salty. Don't drink it. Leùs go!
Today's soup's very salty.
Hey, why'd you steal my bowl?
Gentlemen, welcome, come and have a drink.
Welcome gentlemen, let me sing to you.
Master, have some soup.
2 men drink from the same bowl. Pathetic!
Madam, shall I have them thrown out?
If I made it here,
who'd dare belittle me?
Right, got to be the top.
Who's the best in town?
Master Wong?
Fei Hung!
Aunt 13, you're right. China must change.
Fists can't fight guns.
I'm under house arrest,
soon I'll have to fight.
Take care!
Fei Hung, I'll wait for you.
You don't have to.
If you do,
I won't die in peace.
You won't die...
I'm only mortal... Go home!
Wing, he...
Wing, go inside, iùs raining hard.
Master didn't tell me to, so I daren't.
Wing!
Go back to Po Chi Lam. - Master!
Come, go in!
I... Master, let me do it!
So!
Iùs raining harder.
This is closed, go!
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim from Shandong...
I'm here to...
challenge Master Wong.
Please tell me who Master Wong is?
Master, a challenger! - Wing, pour tea!
Master! - Pour tea!
Please!
Kai, take the patients to one side.
Have a seat!
Why not fold the umbrella now you're inside?
Have some tea!
Foon, whaùre you doing?
Foon?
Master Wong, your techniques are famous,
especially your...
"Shadowless Kick" and "Ten Forms Fist".
I intend to open up my own school,
thus I'm here to challenge you.
So people will know...
my martial arts is the best.
I'm under house arrest,
you could get in trouble.
I can't fight you today.
Be a man. Don't be a coward.
Master Yim!
I've patients here, so iùs not ideal for combat.
Wing, Kai!
Want to be thrown out again?
- Whaùre you standing around for?
- Master.
Take the patients to the back.
I'll take you inside. They're going to fight.
Why do you bother my patients?
Move him or he'll get hurt by my master.
Bull! If not for my Master, I'd beat you up.
Let go! - No!
Goddamn, Foon! - What?
You dare try again?
Yim, stop fighting.
If you go on, I'll fire!
Don't hurt my Master. Give me!
Master, are you alright?
I'm "Iron Vest" Yim. I don't fear guns.
Wong Fei Hung, I won too easily,
it doesn't count.
Leùs have a duel tomorrow in the street.
If you don't come,
I'll assume victory, Foon!
You jerk!
You ungrateful shit!
- Stupid! Stupid!
- Speak Chinese, you infidel.
Are you OK? - Yes, I just slipped!
The guards are hurt,
there'll be trouble.
City Hall will be here soon. Wing, Kai...
go inside, get some money and go.
Aunt 13, go and wake the man from America.
Whaùre you standing around for? Get away.
Take the man with you.
So, you don't know Kung Fu, you're defenseless.
Don't wait for them. Go now. - Mas...
Take care! - I'll see you off!
Don't act recklessly.
Master! - Don't act rashly.
Don't worry, your word is my command.
Kai, tell Aunt 13
to take the man leave immediately.
I release them...
in order to get the whole gang. Search!
Wait! I have many invalid patients here...
They couldn't leave and
thaùs why they stayed here.
Please don't disturb them.
Otherwise they'll become more seriously hurt.
You asked me not to go inside?
So there must be something inside.
But I intend to catch you off guard...
to see who might be hiding
with your patients. Search!
Yes!
Someone's stealing away! - Chase them!
Go.
So, go quick!
Get them! - Yes!
Wing, do it!
What? Master?
Wing, I told you to do it!
Manchurian Dog! - You insult me?
Samson's Lift!
Can we really fight? - Yes!
Where's my gun?
Where're you going? Come back. Shadowless Kick.
Go after them! - Yes!
Don't bother.
The man you want is here.
Divide up. - Yes!
This way.
Hold the pole, the rest go under.
Wong Fei Hung,
I arrest you on charges of treason!
Your Excellency, I'll go with you.
Kai! - Master!
Kai, fetch medicine
for the wounded.
Medicine from Po Chi Lam is the best.
How many are you?
- Are you alright, Your Excellency?
- You good-for-nothing!
We're about there. Hang on!
Now we've got guns, we've got power.
We have to find women for the foreigners.
Sha... Shaho Gang!
Hurry up, go that way.
Woman!
Let go of So!
You get away!
Don't let her go!
Let go!
Sir, take care of yourself.
Run! They're many. Don't stay for me.
Go to hell!
Go!
Let me go! - Go!
There's one over there. Get him!
Get him! Don't go.
Damn you
come to help me now?
Punching Po Chi Lam Kicking Wong Fei Hung?
Challenging Master Wong!
Yes, we're not going home. Leùs wait here!
When do you think Master Wong will be here?
Open your mouth wide.
Open the door!
Go away!
You dare shoot me? You'll be shipped tonight!
Do you hate me?
I want to taste your fresh
Will your skin need spicing up?
When you have to serve those stinking labourers,
you're gonna remember me. Take her to my room!
Yes!
Big Brother, the one who beat Wong is here.
Great!
Good, now Fa Shan will be ours.
Master!
You know each other?
Foon is now your Big Brother.
Confide in him.
He's the Big Brother? Call him Big Brother.

Come... leùs toast Master Yim!
Cheers, Master!
Don't move! What do you want?
Master Wong,

We know you've been set up.
Master Wong, we've decided to free you...
and we'll take responsibility for it.
Master Wong, this way!
Great! Leùs go, Master!
Master!
There're laws in China,
I won't make a mockery of them.
Go! Master! - Go with Master!
No, Excellency. I appreciate it, but I won't go.
Wong... - Master Wong is over there.
Mas... Master!
Master, you're still here?
So! - Master... Mas... Mas...
Speak slowly.
Master... Aunt 13 and I took that man,
but we ran into the Shaho Gang.
They killed him
and captured Aunt 13.
Think of something to save her. - What?
Master Wong, leùs go and save her.
Wing, I'll give you a few men.
Good!
Let them go! - Yes!
Buck Teeth So, how come you spoke so fast?
I was... rehearsing all the way.
I'm sure you'll miss the
Chinese food when you return.
Isn't that Master Wong?
Aren't they the Local Militia?
Master, you're great.
You even beat Wong Fei Hung.
Give us a little demo.
Just a little? Just a little?
OK!
Bitch! The hell with you!
Thaùst enough, Master, enough!
Master, thaùs enough!
Whaùs wrong?
This money is dirty.
Don't accept it.
What? You insulting us?
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
You looking down on us?
Nothing in this world is perfect...
Virture is often found among the lowly...
Our priority is to make our name in Fa Shan.
When thaùs achieved,
we can talk justice.
Thaùs life. Foon, pick up the money!
Pick up the money! Pick up the money!
Pick up the money!
You think you're a Big Brother?

Foon!
Pick up the money!
Make our name in Fa Shan? Thaùs life!
Big Brother!...
Bastard!
Damn you!
Aunt 13, wake up!
Bastard, don't touch me!
Don't scream, I've come to help you.
Foon, is it you? So many people are coming!
Make off, I'll cover you. Quickly, go!
Get that woman!
Foon, stop or...
I'll kill this woman.
Our Big Brother? Go to hell!
Hit me? Damn you!
Master, they are inside. - Leùs go in!
Whaùs going on?
Master, Foon in no time at all...
tried to force himself...
on my life.
No, iùs not true... - Shut up!
Foon, you scum, apologize to your brother.
Yim, we met at Po Chi Lam.
Shut up, you bitch! Go!
You want rebel?
Stupid, she's not his wife.
Stupid.
- She's related to Wong Fei Hung.
- Wong Hung?
Foon is trying to escape!
Escape?
How dare you.
Come back! Get him!
Stop right there

Thank you, come on.
Take it easy! - Yes, Big Brother!
It hurts. - Right!
Master, these people have turned on me...
They'll do the same to you, don't trust them.
You don't trust your brothers,
yet speak out for Wong?
How is it? Too cruel, not used to it?
Let him go,
I'll do anything you want.
What makes you want to sacrifice for him?
Bargain with me? Damn you.
Are you Master Wong's woman?
When I'm done, your face will be so scratched...
Master Wong won't recognize you.
Where's the woman you took away today?
- Big Brother! Master Wong is here!

Arm yourselves. - Yes!
Get all the guns out. - Yes.

"External Chi Kung"?
Today only one of us leaves here alive.
Hey, how do you fire a gun?
Don't worry, we have guns.
You said you're good, come on.

Her Majesty's Royal Armed Forces.
I'm escorting this Chinese officer...
who comes in search of escape prisoners.
On his behalf, I request permission
to search your premises.
This is the territory of
the United States of America.
Permission is not granted, and any trespassing...
will be regarded as direct

I'm Big Brother! You listen to me!
You both don't have to stay. Go save Aunt 13.

Line up the men, ready now.
Go down, quick!
Turn around.

Leave him to me.
They're yours.
Master Wong!
Master Yim, we are done!
He's leaving.
Master Wong, watch out!
Master Wong, where're you?
We haven't finished yet.
Master!
I am Iron Vest...
Master Yim!
Master Yim... - Wong...
We can't fight guns with Kung fu.
You scum.
Master Wong, don't go!
Still going? Don't shoot!
Load the cannon.
This is Commander Man from the
Provincial Government of Guangdong.

No, 10 o'clock 40 degrees. - What?
10 o'clock 40 degrees. - Aim, fire!

Watch out!
Master Wong, have the guts to fight man to man.
Fei Hung, he's got a gun on his knife.
Watch out, don't fall into his trap!
Shut up.
Bitch, you brought them here,

Leùs see which is faster, you or my gun.
Die!
Oh, let me go!
Mr. Jackson. - Sir.
Mr. Jackson and the Shaho Gang...

Your Excellency, save us.
Shaho Gang, I will reward to catch all woman.
By law, you can't kill me,
you must hand me to the Govt.
You have violated international law.
Put down the gun!
- Why won't it fire?
- Did I forget to load it?
If you don't put it down, I'll kill him!
Put down the gun!
You've hurt a Chinese Official...
in a forbidden area.
How will you explain it to the Chinese Govt?
Don't let even one Chinese live.
Then I won't have to explain to any Govt.!
You scum!
You don't have to explain!
- Your Excellency.
- Wow, you dare jump this high.
ChilÔs play. No big deal.
Thank you Your Excellency!
All credit to Master Wong.
Don't mention it. - Thanks Master Wong!
Thank you Master Wong!
China's changed so much, how call I cope?
America? Do they really have gold there?
If they really do have gold,
why would they come here?
Maybe we're standing on gold now.
After this drink, you'll be my Master.
But Aunt 13 and I are so close now...
We'll be together from morning to night.
If one day she marries me,
then you'll have to call me Uncle.
I'll be your senior so you'll have to serve me.
Foon, what are you thinking?
Have some tea, Master!
