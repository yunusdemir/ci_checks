It's rough out at Jamaica, Mary.
'Be that as it may,
it's where I'm bound.'
Mary? Oh, it's never you, is it?
I've nowhere else to go.
There's things going on here
you shouldn't get caught up in.
What, like smuggling?
Oh, I worked that one out.
I'm not stupid...
Well, you are if you say it
so damn loudly.
I'm your brother,
you want to see me hang?
It's the other man.
The one that hid.
He tells your uncle what to do.
I was hiding in the storeroom
and I think they hung a man
called Abe.
Don't say you've seen me.
Please, Mary.
The magistrate has come!
What do you know of the dealings
at this inn?
Nothing, sir.
You're one of us now, Mary.
'Every night since I'd lied to
the magistrate,
'I was tormented by the same dream.'
Mary?
Mary.
Mary!
'I felt a darkness
creeping over me.'
'I'd been at the inn barely a month,
'trapped in this desolate place,
with no hope of escape.
'I'd seen the evil men can do...'
Eli!
'..and I was very afraid.
'I felt whatever innocence
I had left would soon be lost.'
What?
It was hell out,
they was all over the place.
You saying the Revenue
was nearly on you, is that it?
Not us especially. They're patrolling
all down the coast.
Just wanted any free trader
they could catch.
Get their money.
Was Legassik there as well?
But the magistrate came straight
to you, the moment
he arrived in town...
Shhh!
So someone's talking?
Who was it warned you he was coming?
Ain't anything to do with you,
teacher.
Like to hear me talk, do you?
I'm going to church in the morning.
Surely you can't begrudge me that?
No, just don't forget
you're involved now.
Little brother...
..here.
# My comfort still
# Thy cross before to guide me
# And so through
all the length of days
# Thy goodness faileth never
# Good Shepherd,
may I sing thy praise
♪ Within thy house forever. ♪
The Lord is our shepherd, and yet
you sit here poor and hungry.
You cannot feel his love.
Many of you suffer greatly.
You feel that you're lost in
a dark wilderness.
But I tell you this...
If you will put your trust in God
and Jesus, and in me,
then he will lead you
to green pastures
and your suffering will have ending.
Hello again. Enjoy the service?
Yes, I did. Very much.
Will's off today...
to France.
So you'd better sort
that wedding dress out,
because you'll need it when I'm back.
Mary, I'm very glad
you joined us here today.
We were hoping that you might.
Perhaps you'd like to help us?
Without our alms
the poor'd starve to death.
Folk up-country don't care
if we live or die.
Do you feed them every day?
Mr Davey does.
He has more patience.
I'd rather mend the pews
or reap the harvest.
I think perhaps
you did not come here today
only for the service, Mary?
Come. There is nothing that
confiding cannot help.
The Ship Of Fools.
It's an allegory from the Bible.
A vessel of deranged humans cast out
on the sea without a captain.
The plight of the Godless.
What did you want to share with me,
Mary?
I don't think that I should.
The smuggling, at Jamaica Inn,
is widely known.
And mostly, it is tolerated.
The people here use liquor like
it is some ancient cure
that will relieve them
of their suffering.
They're grateful to your uncle
for supplying it.
I lied...
..to the magistrate.
He came about your uncle's dealings?
I said I knew nothing.
I lied.
Don't be afraid, Mary.
Mr Davey...
The other night...
..I think my uncle killed a man.
I was hiding and I heard a noise...
..like...like choking.
And I saw a noose.
His name was Abe.
His wife was asking after him,
last time I was in Altarnun.
So, you know he's missing.
His wife...has gone to join him
in the town.
He sent for her.
No, no...he can't have done.
He can't have done.
My uncle killed him.
Did you see a body?
No. I heard it though.
And I can't bear it on
my conscience.
Mary, we've been observing your
uncle's dealings for some time.
We're working with the law enforcers
to try to gain some evidence
of his crimes.
The ones who can be trusted anyway.
Many profit handsomely themselves,
or else are in collusion.
So what should I do?
She should take care for her
own skin is what she should do.
Who knows what Merlyn's capable of?
My aunt says that there's someone
else who works above my uncle...
..tells him what to do.
He was hiding in the inn
that night that Abe was murdered.
Did you see him?
Only his feet.
Someone else above him?
Could it be Legassik?
Perhaps his brother, Jem.
You won't say anything, will you?
He'd kill me if he knew I'd talked.
Of course we won't.
Perhaps...Mary might be
our ears and eyes?
She could help us
to investigate her uncle.
That's Captain Legassik.
Do you think it could be a dragoon?
I think my brother has been hasty.
You're just a girl, it isn't right
that you should risk your own skin.
I'd like to help.
Still not laying. Just three again.
Would you like them, Uncle?
Good girl, eh, Joss?
I've got a letter for you,
Miss Yellan, from the town.
Mail coaches
won't stop out 'ere no more...
cos of him.
Harry.
He said they'd be sailing in
this way.
What, that lad's ship? Shhh!
I didn't think we could do
another one so soon.
You don't need to think.
Who is it from?
Mary?
Ned. A boy from home.
Is he your sweetheart, is he?
He would be...
if I'd have him.
What about the Revenue?
We know they're watching.
'I know, Mary, that maybe now
is not the right time.
'But you must think about
what you will do...
'if you and I should marry.'
'Yours, as ever, Ned.'
This don't feel right, Joss.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing's wrong with me.
I'm just telling you,
it don't feel right.
Where's those bloody eggs?
But I thought you said we couldn't
do another till the spring.
It don't matter what I said!
I'm sayin' something else now!
Do you understand me?
Stop, please!
Please! Joss...
Harry, get out.
Go on, go!
Don't you ever do that to me again!
Leave her alone.
Stay out of it!
You don't understand him.
There.
You're all right.
You're all right.
I've got to go and talk to him.
Tell him the Revenue is on to us.
No, Joss. You can't.
You know what he might do to you!
No...
Not while I'm still useful to him.
Please don't, Joss. Please don't.
Don't.
Please!
The mist came down on the moor
and I lost my way.
You're lucky it was me.
Anyone else would've had you
in the heather.
They'd have to knock me
senseless first!
I'm sure they'd be quite happy.
You've blood on you.
Been skinning a rabbit.
Have you eaten?
Why are you living out here?
I thought you had a house.
I'll tell you if you tell me what
you were doing out here on your own.
You should leave your aunt.
Come look after me, you know.
You wouldn't have the money
that I'd ask!
Women are always mean.
My mother used to keep her money
hidden in her stocking.
You can serve yourself.
How long since your mother died?
11 years this Christmas.
My father went when I was six,
he swung at Exeter
for killing a man in a brawl.
Not that I was sad about it.
He used to beat us half to death.
My mother, too.
When Joss went out to sea,
I couldn't stand it any more,
so I cleared off as soon as I could.
Went off to war.
I suppose I should be grateful
my parents were always
so good to me.
There's only you?
My father died when I was four.
Smugglers murdered him.
So how is my brother?
Did the Magistrate arrest him?
You know he didn't,
cos you've seen your brother since.
In fact,
the Magistrate was asking after you
but I said I hadn't seen you.
Ah!
So you can do as you're told, then!
I dare say if I'd thought about it,
I'd have told him where you were.
But seeing as I didn't, you can
tell me what you've got to hide.
Well, that horse belongs
to the Magistrate, for one.
I stole it from his trap
last Thursday.
He'd have my head for that alone.
I know there's another man
gives my uncle orders.
Is it you?
What do you think?
I think
there's no tenderness in you.
You're rude.
And you're a thief who stands for
everything I despise.
And yet...
..you like me.
I do not like you.
Come to market with me,
Christmas Eve.
Come to Launceston...
..and help me sell that horse.
What, and get caught with you?
What's wrong?
Don't you like excitement?
Come.
Come to market.
"Come to market"?
With a man who's mired in... What?
What am I mired in, Mary?
Come on. I'll take you back.
I'll come by here at ten
on Christmas Eve.
Meet me by the road.
I won't be there.
He was up half the night drinking.
He couldn't sleep.
Come on. We can get things done.
Is my uncle planning something?
I was worried where you'd got to
last night.
I was lost on the moors and...
Jem Merlyn brought me home.
Jem Merlyn, eh?
I was lost
and he was kind enough to...
Why do you dislike him so much,
Aunt Patience?
Never said I did.
You're scared of him, then.
Well,
if that's what lights your candle.
He has bad dreams.
When you've done in here,
fetch some water for the trough.
This here is Mr Davey.
Vicar of Altarnun church.
That's my niece, Mary.
I believe you came to
my sermon last week, Mary?
Yes, sir. I did.
I was nearby on the road,
and I heard an awful screaming.
I've told Mr Davey we're all right.
We don't need nothing.
And you, Mary?
Do you need anything?
No.
Thank you, sir.
Well...
I'll be on my way, then.
Who's there?
Put that knife down!
Uncle Joss?
Where've they all gone?
There's no-one here.
Just me.
Dreams.
Dreams, Mary.
Brandy.
Bring it here.
You sit with me.
They pay gold for this up country.
And what do I pay?
Not a sixpence.
It's a man's game though, Mary.
I've...
..killed men with these hands.
Trampled them under the water.
Bashed their heads in with rocks.
But when I drink,
I see their faces staring at me.
Their eyes...
Eaten by the fish.
And their flesh...
Hanging off in ribbons.
I don't understand you.
There's a fog on the water.
Just outside the bay, there's a ship.
She sees one big light up ahead,
swinging side to side.
And she thinks there's another ship
'tween her and the shore,
with miles of sea to go.
But there is no other ship,
just our false light.
So in she comes.
Straight to us.
We hear the scraping
as she hits the rocks below...
..and then there's the screaming
as the ship breaks up.
And they're struggling for shore,
'cept it would be better that
they swam the other way.
Cos there we are,
waiting with our clubs in hand,
ready to break their bones
and drown them till they're dead.
You wreck ships on purpose?
Murder all the sailors.
Women...
..children too, if there be any.
Monster, am I?
You judge me!
Oh, you don't know the half of it,
girl!
You think you're better than me.
Think you're too good for me.
Is that it?
I am too good.
And if your conscience
didn't torment you,
you wouldn't have such nightmares.
And you'll hang for this.
Mm.
Like your father did?
My father was a good man.
And it was smugglers who killed him!
No.
Your father was a smuggler himself.
The law hanged him, Mary.
That isn't true!
Tell her, Patience.
Tell her what her precious father
really was.
You judge me, girl.
You're the same as me.
You came, then!
And a happy Christmas to you,
Mary Yellan.
That's not the greeting
I was hoping for.
So what's the matter with you, then?
I know.
You've been thinking of me
so hard you couldn't sleep?
Yes, I thought of you once.
I wondered who would hang first,
you or your brother.
He drank himself into a stupor.
He told me that he wrecks ships
and murders people.
So what will you do?
Will you tell the law?
I haven't decided yet.
Anyway, you're in it with him.
I haven't noticed you deny it yet.
If that's what you think,
why are you here?
For the sake of your bright eyes,
Jem Merlyn.
And perhaps because I am no better.
My father wasn't good and decent, he
was a violent man who hanged for it.
Your brother told me that.
So that's what's put you
in this stink, is it?
I feel that everything's a lie.
Your brother's stole everything
I thought I knew about myself.
Well, that's all right.
Be someone else, then.
I can't be Jem Merlyn, not if the
law's about, so we'll play a game.
You can be anyone you want to be,
as long as it's not dreary.
And as long as
you start smiling, eh?
Come on.
Right, let's get him in disguise
for market.
We don't want no-one
recognising him.
I don't want anyone
to recognise me either.
I like it.
See that, there?
Twelve Men's Moor,
where me and Joss grew up.
What? In the mud?
Or did you have a house?
We built one.
Out of mud.
And all we ate was mud and all.
We had a house.
Beautiful cuddy.
Beautiful cuddy.
There's Mrs Bassat -
Magistrate's wife.
And that's her brother.
But what if Bassat's here as well?
Aren't you scared you'll get caught?
Caught for what?
He lost a horse with one white sock,
a long mane and a diamond mark.
This one's legs are black
right down, his mane's clipped
and his ear mark's a slit.
Well, if it's SO easy,
why aren't YOU a rich man.
Ah, see, I make the money
but then I spend it.
Nice young cuddy.
A ten-year-old,
half-broken, good provenance.
Bring him in. Bring him in.
I want to see him.
An old mare,
sane and sensible temperament.
You there? Let me see him.
He's 18 guineas.
Where'd you get him from?
Cos he wasn't bred on the moors, not
with a head and shoulders like that.
He was foaled at Callington,
I bought him
as a yearling from old Tim Bray.
The dam was Irish bred.
I wouldn't touch him if I were you.
Where's your mark?
You're sharp, aren't you?
Anyone'd think I'd stolen him.
It's a good thing for you that
Tim Bray's gone to Dorset.
I'd leave him
before you land yourself in trouble.
Look at him. See?
Lovely foal,
sired by stallion...
Look, this ribbon's
perfect for my wedding gown.
Mm. You'll need to finish it
if Will gets home tomorrow.
What do I hear?
14. Get on, gentlemen!
We can do better than that!
17. 18. 18!
18 I'll do.
Oh, look, James!
That pony holds its head
just like our poor Beauty did.
What a nuisance Roger isn't here!
You want to buy him?!
He'd be such a lovely present
for the children.
They've been devastated
since poor Beauty went.
You there? Fellow?
How much is that, er, pony?
He's not for sale.
He's promised to my friend there.
Besides he wouldn't carry you -
used to being ridden by children.
He's absolutely perfect then!
I'll pay your price -
and extra for your disappointment.
I gave my word on 25 guineas.
I'll give you 30.
I'm Mrs Bassat from North Hill.
The Magistrate's my husband.
Here, take the money.
Then I hope that Mr Bassat will be
pleased with your purchase.
Of course he's really
nothing like our Beauty -
he was a thoroughbred
and three or four hands higher -
but he'll please the children. Hmm.
You should be hanged, Jem Merlyn.
Selling a horse to the very woman
you stole it from!
Glad you came now, though, eh?
Yes.
Come on, I'll buy you a present.
And his disciple, Andrew, saith,
"There is a lad here,
that hath five barley loaves,
"and two small fishes:
but what are they among so many?"
And Jesus took the loaves; and when
he had given thanks,
he gave them
to the multitude of five thousand...
..and likewise with the fishes.
Here.
And when those men saw the miracle
that Jesus did... What is it?
Ale.
..they knew he was a prophet.
Why? Don't you drink?
Daniel! Daniel,
get yourself over here!
Huh! That'll put an end to Davey's
do-gooding for today.
Bring it round.
Bring it round.
We can't ride home in this.
We'll have to spend the night here.
We'll wait for it to clear.
Come on, Mary.
I've money enough for a room.
God, you're hard as flint!
I'll buy you a ring, if
it makes you feel more respectable.
It's not often I have money enough
in my pocket to make the offer.
How many wives do you happen to
have, then?
Six or seven,
scattered over Cornwall.
I don't count the ones
across the Tamar.
That's wives enough for any man.
Mary, don't let's fight.
I suppose you think
I'll go to bed with you
cos all I am is a barmaid
at Jamaica Inn?
No.
Of course not.
Pretend that
you're in love with me...
..can't you?
You'd stay with me then.
I wish I could stay with you...
..and forget it all by the morrow,
as I'm sure you would.
But I can't.
Today doesn't exist.
We made it up.
And tomorrow it'll be gone.
Oh, I...I didn't look for this.
And I don't want it.
You're different, Mary.
You really want me, don't you?
I do.
I do.
I think perhaps I'd better pay!
Back in a minute.
Half a guinea, ain't it?
I won't take YOUR money, Mr Merlyn.
He's gone. Now clear out.
Maybe he was hoping for something
else under them breeches.
Mary? Hannah!
Whatever's happened to you?
I'm such a fool!
Oh...
So, will you tell me
what has happened?
I can't.
You'll think I'm very stupid.
I won't.
You're anything but stupid, Mary.
I came to Launceston with a man.
But he left me
in the bedroom at the inn.
He made sure I'd have him,
and then he left.
So who is he, this man?
Mm-hm? Jem Merlyn, I suppose?
And I care for him...
..but I wish
I could tear out how I feel
and trample it in with the dirt.
You're all at sea. Hmm...
Love's the curse of too many women.
To fear nothing, and desire nothing,
that's what it is to be free, Mary.
Was there never anyone
you cared for?
Were you never married?
It wasn't God's path for me.
There's Mr Davey.
We'll drop you back.
Mr Davey, see if there's a blanket.
I suppose you're disappointed in me.
I'm disappointed in myself.
Tonight, I see a different
Mary Yellan.
Here.
Get out of these wet clothes now.
Thank you.
To flout what is expected of us...
..and cast aside the customs
of the age requires great strength.
And yet I have shown the weakness
of a woman.
You followed your desires
and they were thwarted.
Would you feel differently if
the man in question had remained...
..to complete the act?
I suppose
I should be grateful that he left.
I hate myself
for how I feel about him.
I don't want to be like
those other girls.
You feel yourself as different?!
You leave her be.
She isn't different.
How old are you, Mary Yellan?
Twenty.
You're nothing but a chicken with
the broken shell still around you.
You'll come through
your little crisis.
You have no need to shed tears over
a man encountered once or twice.
You will forget him very soon...
..and you will learn the things
that really matter.
Have you gone over it
with the rest of them?
Yes. And they understand?
Course they do.
And they'll be there?
They will. Joss?
Put the maps away.
Don't do it.
What is it you want me to do, uh?!
Want me to say no,
when he's already threatened us?
Is that it?
No...
Maybe you could say
you missed the ship?
Couldn't you say that, Jossey?
Eh? You could say that!
Old man...
..time to go.
Mr Davey...
..I found out
that my uncle is a wrecker.
He lures in ships with false lights
and murders all the crew.
He was drunk last night.
He told me everything.
So the landlord talks
when he is drunk, does he?
Yes, sir.
Have you told anyone?
Jem Merlyn knows.
I believe my uncle is planning
to wreck another ship soon.
So will you bring the Magistrate?
I've spent this very evening with
the Magistrate and customs officers.
They have confirmed the King is
sending down a coastguard.
There will be watchers on the cliffs
in a chain
that will be very hard to break.
Wrecking must cease.
Smugglers must leave or perish.
So, my uncle will be caught?
If there is evidence.
I love these moors.
They're like survivors
of another time.
Climb Roughtor before sunrise...
..and listen to the wind crying
through the stones.
Then you will feel God.
Would you drop me at the turning
before the inn?
I'd like to get back
without my uncle seeing me.
Of course.
Sir?
Where the bloody hell have you been?
It's not your business
where I've been.
Maybe she's been talking?
I have, and I've told them
everything about you.
You think you know it all, don't you?
You don't know nothing.
You want to dress like a man, hmm?
Then come and do some man's work.
We have to leave, then?
Move on somewhere else?
Perhaps it's for the best.
I have business to attend to first.
Then we must silence those
who will be a threat to us.
You have a choice to make.
Turn King's evidence
against your brother.
Or pay the price for both
of you - and hang alone.
You are mad.
I will show you
who's mad, girl.
I wish I could have
spared you this.
What are you doing, Joss?
Your brother thinks
he's coming here to kill him.
Whatever my uncle may have
been to you, he is inhuman now.
He is MY husband.
And you won't
talk of him like that.
Joss?
There's no longer any need
for pretence between us, Mary.
We can be frank now.
That's right,
you'll sleep now.
