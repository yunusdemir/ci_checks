What? Are you guys having
a war or something?
She's pissed off 'cause I'm taking shop.
Like I'm embarrassing them. My dad too.
It won't embarrass them when their stupid
Volvo breaks down and you can fix it for free.
- What?
- Last night, we're playing Scrabble.
And it's like neck-and-neck between me and her.
We blew my dad away early.
So, right at the end, I had this choice
of putting down ''ratio'' for five lousy points...
- or...
- Or what, Arnie?
''fellatio'' on a triple word score
for 24 points and the game.
- What'd she do? She wouldn't let me have it.
- She won by seven points...
she said because obscenity's
not allowed in Scrabble.
- And I looked it up and it's in the dictionary!
- You jerk, Arnie. Jesus.
You know, Arnie,
I was thinking--
Uh-oh.
No, seriously.
Now that we're gonna be seniors,
I figure it's about time,..
that we got you laid.

- You need a girl to get laid.

How much do you want for her?
- Whatever it is, it's not enough.
- Jesus, Arnie.
Sonny, you ever owned a car before?
- Yeah, he owns a Mustang--
- No. I just got my license.
Name's George LeBay.
Arnie Cunningham.
What are you asking?
Start her up.
Really?
Her name's Christine.
I like that.
Come on. We gotta get going.
My asshole brother
bought her in September, '57.
You got your new model year
in September.
Brand-new, she was.
She had the smell
of a brand-new car.
About the finest smell in the world,
except maybe for pussy.
When he got her,
she had six miles on the odometer.
Goddamn Roland went through hell
and back with Christine.
lf your brother loves this car so much,
why is he selling it?
'Cause he's stone cold dead.
Died six weeks ago.
So, Mr. LeBay...
how much do you want for her?
I've been asking 300.
I'll make it 250 for you.
250? This isn't worth 50 bucks.
The money's not important,
and there'll be no bringing her back here...
'cause I'm selling this shit hole
and buying me a condo.
You got a deal.
I'll get the pink slip.
Will you stop and think about this
for a moment?
- Where are you getting the money?
- I've been saving all summer.
- For college.
- You already have a car.
He's screwing you.
You could get a decent car
for that much money.
Christine is decent.
The guy's weird, Arnie.
He's fucking weird.
- So that was 300?
- Yeah, that's it.
- You said 250.
- 250 would do it.
It this is a good idea,
let's just come back tomorrow.
Do you realize
she's 20 years old?
I mean, that makes her
officially an antique.
Great. Darnell's junkyard
is full of official antiques.
I'm buying her.
I don't care what you say.
It's your funeral, man.
Would you give
Arnie a break?
He doesn't know what he's doing.
You don't know half as much
as you think you do...
shitter.
You did what?
- She's outside.
- You're kidding, right?
You can't buy a car.
What are you talking about?
- You're 17 years old.
- Oh, boy.
Actually, you're wrong.
I couldn't finance it,
but buying it for cash is no problem.
Registering a car at 17
is something else...
and for that
I need your permission.
You know how we do things.
You could've consulted with us.
I've consulted with you
about every damn thing I've ever done.
If it's something I want,
I get outvoted, two to one!
This is no committee meeting.
I bought the car, and that's it!
It most certainly
is not it!
How could you have
let him do this?
I didn't let him.
He wanted the car, and he bought it.
I tried to talk him out ot it.
I doubt you tried very hard.
- Yeah, well, I'm going home.
- I think you should.
That's it. I'm getting
the fuck out of here.
- What kind of lang--
- What did you say!
You wanted me in college courses.
I'm there.
You wanted chess club instead of band.
I'm there too.
I've managed 17 years without
embarrassing you or landing in jail.
I'm gonna have this one thing!
You are not keeping
any car at this house.
Fine!
Thanks for the milk.
- What's the problem?
- Could you honk your horn for me?
Christine's doesn't
seem to work.
- Ah. Sure,
- Thanks.
Stall 20.
Get it over there
and shut it off...
before we all
choke to death.
Kiddo, if you sold him that piece of
shit, you ought to be fuckin' ashamed.
I didn't sell it to him.
I tried to talk him out of it.
You should have tried harder.
I knew a guy who had
a car like that once.

killed himself in it.

- Ah, sir?
- What?

- Huh?
- Yes, sir.
Good.
Now get the hell out of here.
We're closed.
You gonna be okay?
Yeah. I'm okay.
You know, you better find yourself some
other charity besides me and Christine.
What is it about that car?
I don't know.
Maybe it's just that for the first time
I've found something uglier than me.
And I know I can fix her up.
You're not ugly, Arnie.
I know what I am,

- Are you going with him?
- Am I?
No. I've gotta do an errand
for Darnell.
- You need a ride?
- Got his car. Thanks, though.
I'm sorry about the movie,
but this is work. Gotta go.
- Don't worry about it.
- Did you have plans with Dennis?
You are going to have no friends at all
if you keep treating people this way.
Get off my back!
You're his best friend.
What's going on?
I don't know.
I hardly see him anymore.
Neither do we.
Ever since he bought that car
he's been obsessed with it.
And you know what else?
When we signed the registration papers
at Town Hall...
they told us the man
who owned that car last...
died in it
of carbon monoxide poisoning.
Jesus.
Does Arnie know about that?
Arnie doesn't know anything anymore.
What the hell do you want?
I know about your brother.
I know he died
choking on exhaust fumes.
You don't know shit, kid.
My brother died
'cause he wanted to.
He ran a rubber hose
from the exhaust pipe.
Arnie wouldn't have bought it
if he'd known somebody died in it.
Either you're dumb or you
don't know your friend very well,
He had the same look
my brother always had.
Probably the only thing my brother
ever loved in his life was that car.
No shitter ever came between him
and Christine. If they did, watch out.
His five-year-old daughter choked to
death in it. He wouldn't get rid of it.
He rode around without a care
in the world except for Christine.
Only time I ever interfered
was when Rita killed herself.
- Who's Rita?
- His wife!
He didn't care
a rat's ass about her.
She died the same way he did.
Then I made him get rid of it.
For decency, you know.
Of course, the car came back
three weeks later.

Please.
You know, I've been thinking.
Maybe we should apply
to the same colleges next year.
- Really?
- Yeah.

I spent a shitload of money on her,
and she's perfecto now.
That's funny, you know, 'cause...
I heard she was totaled.
After I cleaned up the broken glass,
it wasn't so bad.
I bet you a hundred bucks...
it was Buddy Repperton.
Maybe.
So what if you fix it up and he
just comes back and does it again?
He won't do it again.
What does that mean?
Man, I gotta go.
I hope you didn't think
I could hang around here all day.
Yeah, that's you, Arnie,
always in demand.
Stay loose.
You know it.
Happy Thanksgiving.
Lean machine.
They let you out early?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm Rudolph Junkins,
State Police, Detective.
I'm just missing a study hall.
I got to get to work.
I don't care about that.
I want to ask you about your car.
You do nice body work.
I thought this thing was totaled.
- Who told you that?
- Why, hell, everybody.
Local police, your mom and dad,
your girl. Cute girl, by the way.
It wasn't as bad as it looked.
The report said
they punched holes in the body.
Damned if I can see the fill.
You can if you look.
It's right over there...
and back here.
I've been lucky with parts.
I replaced the entire door on this side.
- Yeah?
- See where the paint doesn't match?
Nope. A hell of a job, Arnie.
Well, thank you very much.
So what do you want?
I really like this shade of red.
Didn't think they made this anymore.
Do they still make this shade?
Well, they must.
I bought it, didn't I?
- Where?
- Baker Auto out on Route 5.
- You still got the receipt?
- Tossed it out.
You know, it's funny--
Cigarette?
No, thanks.
Usually when somebody trashes a car,
we get photographs.
Wait. They didn't really trash it.
That's not what Leigh said.
She was so shaken up,
giving me all the details...
she broke down crying.
I understand...
one of the perpetrators
defecated on the dashboard.
I would've thought you'd
be madder than hell at that...
and I would've thought
you would've reported that.
Shit wipes off.
Moochie Welch
kind of got wiped off too.
I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No.
Scout's honor?
I'm not a Scout.
The kid was cut in half. They had
to scrape his legs up with a shovel.
Isn't that what you're supposed
to do with shit...
scrape it up with a shovel?
Don't get smart with me, son.
Your girlfriend is
more convincing than you are.
She's not my girlfriend.
And since when is it against the law
to fix your own car...
when somebody else busts it up?
Since never.
Then you get off my back.
I need to see you.
I care about you.
Look, I love you.
I think we deserve one more try.
Don't you?
Would you give me a yes or no!
Please don't do this to me.
Just be straight with me.
You've had it, right?
Well, fuck you, bitch!
Want to do the honors?
I'd love to bring her along.
Sure.
- She can earn her way.
- Bullshit.
Let's get Vandenberg.
Baby!

- Is that Cunningham?
- It can't be.
Look at my car.
Come on, prick!
We're not finished yet.
Come on!
Hello, Henry? This is Will.
Listen. Cunningham get there?
The order okay?
Good.
Listen. He was driving

Good. Yes. Take it easy.
Okay, Jack. Come on out.
The ride is over.

- What's goin' on?
- You tell me.
- Where were you last night?
- Home.
- What are you doing to my car?
- You didn't go out at all?
Of course I went out. I got Darnell's
car out front with a load of parts.
- You want the receipt?
- Yeah.
How come you're showing up just now?
Why didn't you unload
the stuff last night?
Because I was tired, that's why.
If you don't believe me,
you can ask my mother.
Why do you keep
butting into my life?
Because we found your boss,
Will Darnell, dead in your front seat...
with a shotgun by his side.
- Why?
- I was hoping you could answer that.
Somebody saw your car cruising
behind Buddy Repperton last night.
He's dead too.
So are Don Vandenberg
and Richard Trelawney.
Guess nobody'll be trashing
your car anymore.
Well, all I know--
I got a Cadillac full of parts...
and I'm supposed to be
at school in half an hour.
We'll take care of the Caddy.
I don't want you touching it.
Honest, I don't know what's going on.
I swear I don't.
May I please speak to Dennis?
It's a girl.
Happy New Year.
Can I come over there?
I need to talk to you.
- What, about Arnie?
- About Christine.
You first.
I'm afraid for Arnie.
I thought you wanted to talk
about Christine.
What do you know about that car?
I know that the guy
who owned the car before Arnie--
Yeah?
His daughter choked to death
in Christine.
How do you know that?
LeBay's brother sold Arnie the car,
and the guy's a jerk.
- He just came out and told me.
- I think I was supposed to be next.
Come on.
Arnie would never do that.
Not in a million years.
I don't think he's Arnie.
It's that car.
I swear it's the car.
Maybe.
I'm going to Arnie's tonight
for New Year's--
- I wouldn't.
- It's okay.
We do it every year.
His folks are going to be there.
Maybe if I get him alone,
maybe he'll talk to me.
What if he doesn't?
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.
What if that car doesn't let him?
Then we destroy it.

My man, you really operate
on those babies.
Yeah, I manage.
We got the old rust bucket tonight.
You wanna watch what you call my car.
She's real sensitive.
Is she?
Sorry, Christine.
Good boy.
Let's motorvate.
Have a beer.
Don't be shy,
My car's your car.
A toast.
Death...
to the shitters
of the world in 1979.
Come on.
I can't drink to that.
What can you drink to?
What about to us?
You know, to friendship?
Oh, friendship. Right.
That's real good.
Come on!
I want you to see this.
This is great alignment.
You just don't see this anymore.
Don't be scared.
I'm scared for you,
for what's happened to you.
It's this fucking car.
I know you're jealous.
We'll always be friends,
as long as you stick with me.
You know what happens
to shitters who don't.
No. What does happen?
Let's not kid each other.
Who are the shitters?
All of 'em.
Leigh's on your side.
- Oh, yeah?
- She cares a lot about you.
She does.
Yeah.
Don't you like this beer?
I thought you liked beer.
Did you hear what I just said?
Let me tell you
a little something about love.
It has a voracious appetite.
It eats everything--
friendship, family.
It kills me, how much it eats.
I'll tell you something else.
Feed it right,
and it can be a beautiful thing...
and that's what we have.
When someone believes in you, you can do
any fucking thing in the universe...
and when you believe right back
in that someone...
then watch out, world,
'cause nobody can stop you ever!
You feel this way about Leigh?
What? Fuck, no!
I'm talkin' about Christine, man.
No shitter ever came
between me and Christine.
Watch this.
Oh, shit.
Chicken shit!
Man, there is nothin' finer than being
behind the wheel of your own car...
except maybe for pussy.
It's kinda spooky in here, huh?
Looks like they cleaned out
the whole place.
Jesus.
That's where he used to keep it.
Down there.
Yeah.
You better get started,
Yeah!
What do you think?
Let's try it.
Christine's gonna come
through the door.
You better get in the office
and stay out of sight.
Once she gets inside, hit the button
and bring the door down.
Then we'll have her trapped.
What if he doesn't come?
Christine will.
You better get in the office.
Keep your head down.
When you hear me start this thing up,
that's when you hit the button.
Leigh, don't move!
Stay where you are!
You shitters!
Oh, God.
Arnie's dead.
