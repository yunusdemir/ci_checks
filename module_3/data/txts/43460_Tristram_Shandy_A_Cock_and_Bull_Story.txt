You look good with
a big nose, actually.
You could become a great
classical actor
and be taken seriously.
I got a little crevice,
can you see that there?
See?
- Yes.
- That's fizzy drinks.
- Yeah.
- And I don't think the color is great.
What do you think?
Have a look at the color.
I saw the color
last time I looked.
It registered.
It's what I'd call
"not white."
- Well...
- What color would you call it?
I would... I'd concur
with "not white."
I'd go further.
I mean,
it's not yellow.
I, you know...
it's a sliding scale,
isn't it, you know.
- Yeah.
- I think you're...
- you're a...
- Hint of yellow.
- Closest to...
- Barley meadow.
- If you wanna give it...
- Tuscan sunset?
If you want...
You're getting laughs
but it's not making
your teeth look any better.
No, you know, so...
Pub ceiling?
The elephant man.
Mmm.
I think if your teeth
are too good,
you get bogged down
in the leading-man thing,
and I don't want
that to happen.
I think you can
sleep easy at night...
about the prospect
of being cast as a leading man.
Now I haven't got any teeth
at all there on the bottom.
Thanks for that.
That was pleasant.
Have another look.
Do they still look that color?
- It's okay...
- Let yourself adjust...
It's seared
on my retina.
I think once people
get used to them,
you actually...
actually, it's a nice color.
I think you could decorate a child's
nursery in this color.
Quite soothing.
But you could have saved them a few bob
If you'd been cast as Dr. Slop.
Yeah, but that's very
much a supporting role.
- This is...
- Yeah, and? The point being?
This is a co-lead.
Well, we'll see after
the edit, shall we?
Do you not think so?
Featured co-lead?
It's not a cameo.
It's not a cameo, no.
It's a supporting role.
It's not a supporting role.
I mean, all the way through.
Yeah.
It's a co. It's a co,
it's an "and Rob Brydon."
- It's us.
- It's not an under.
It's Steve Coogan,
Rob Brydon.
In fact, if we went
alphabetically,
which I think is
the only fair way,
it would be Rob Brydon,
Steve Coogan.
Yeah, but that would
just be ridiculous.
Ahem...
Groucho Marx once said
that the trouble with writing a book
about yourself
is you can't
fool around.
Why not? People fool around
with themselves all the time.
I'm Tristram Shandy,
the main character
in this story,
the leading role.
Susannah!
Susannah!
Susannah!
There are those who say
this is
a cock and bull story.
That's the bull,
my father's bull,
and I'll show you
the cock in a minute.
Susannah!
Susannah!
- Is it started?
- Yes.
- Yes, l... I think it is.
- Oh ma'am!
- Shall I fetch the midwife?
- Yes.
These two gentlemen are my Uncle Toby
and Corporal Trim.
They're recreating
the Battle of Namur
where they both fought.
Get them forward!
Colonel Ingoldsby's orders, sir.
The flag is to advance
to the ditch
behind the 50-pounder.
What?! The ditch?
There's no such thing
as a ditch out there.
The ditch behind
the 50-pounder, sir!
That is a ravelin.
A ravelin.
A farmer
digs a ditch!
- And so...
- Sir, get down!
When I said this was
a cock and bull story,
it was my cock
I was talking about,
not Uncle Toby's.
After all, am I not
the hero of my own life?
- Where's my chamber-pot?
- Master Tristram, where is it?
What have you done with it?
Is it hidden under the bed?
- Where is it?
- You'll have to let out of the window...
I need to pee!
Lift your
nightshirt up.
Poke your little pecker
out the window.
Do you think the time might come
when you don't make much of a fuss
about passing
your water? That's it.
That is a child actor
pretending to be me.
I'll be able to
play myself later.
I think I could probably
get away with being...
18, 19?
Until then, I'll be played by
a series of child actors.
This was the best
of a bad bunch.
He's unable to convey
the pain or shock
of such an event.
I think I can.
Susannah said I was doing it
exactly how you did it.
It may be
the same noise,
but it doesn't
have the emotion.
Go on, then.
Show me how to do it.
I was doing it
with a comedy,
not a pantomime.
Master Tristram!
Come here, let me
fix it all better.
Just about murdered you.
Oh my darling.
My dear darling.
Yes, there...
there, what happened?
This is my beautiful,
lovely mother
Elizabeth.
How did this happen?
It was my fault.
I removed the weights
- from the sash window...
- What?
At Mr. Toby's request to make
mortars for the Siege of Namur.
I wish now with all my heart
I had cut off something else.
My poor little Tristram.
So both my uncle
and myself were victims
of the Battle of Namur
even though it took place
years before my birth.
I was not unmanned,
by the way.
I was circumcised
like a lot of men...
manly men.
I can't speak
for my uncle in that area,
although even as a boy
I was curious.
Sir, where were you
injured during battle?
- This stretch of wall...
- This one looks quite like me.
The front of the curtain
is the breast.
- None of the men...
- There's a ravelin below this fosse.
- I shall dig it now, sir.
- There was indeed, Corporal, yes.
I tumbled into it just... in the course
of the afternoon.
Where exactly
were you injured?
I will show you
the exact spot.
Soldier, quick march.
I received my injury
at nine of the clock
- just here.
- In the...
in the ditch.
I'm getting ahead of myself.
I am not yet born.
Mrs. Shandy's
took bad, sir,
with the pangs, sir.
They're coming thick and fast.
On my way to fetch midwife.
- She's doing badly?
- Yes, sir.
With the pangs.
When I was born, my father was
four years older than I am now.
So, given the family
resemblance,
I thought I should
portray him
as well as myself.
Walter! Brother Walter!
Brother, Elizabeth
isn't well, Brother.
- She's suffering from pangs.
- Pangs?
I believe she was referring
to the birth pangs, sir.
She's gone
to fetch the midwife
- and fast...
- The midwife?
No no no no.
Obadiah!
Obadiah!
I want you to ride like the devil
to Dr. Slop's
and tell him my wife
has fallen into labor
and I desire him
to come immediately.
I will not have
the midwife deliver my son.
Come on! Come on!
Get up!
You may find it surprising
that the method of my birth
had yet to be decided.
The cause was not too little planning,
but too much.
"I, Walter Shandy, undertake to arrange
for any confinement
of Elizabeth Shandy
in London,
and further undertake
to pay all expenses
arising from
that confinement."
Hmm.
What is the smaller
writing here?
That's just small print.
You always get that.
This is the beginning
of all my woes.
I should have to
stay in Yorkshire?
Yes, only if you once
already made the journey
to London by mistake.
In the September
before my birth
my mother, being pregnant...
or so she thought...
insisted my father
take her to London.
- You all right, my love?
- I'm fairly comfortable.
Not long now.
Just another two days.
Tell me, doctor, in your opinion,
is it a boy or a girl?
I'm afraid, madam,
it is neither.
It is a phantom only.
How can that be?
This happens more
than you can know.
£10.
£10 to tell us
that it's wind
that is inflating you.
Any other time of the year
would have been fine, but...
all my plums
will be spoiled.
It's not the expense
that bothers me,
but the disappointment
of losing a child.
Walter, I too
have lost a child!
No matter, dear.
Don't fret.
Please.
Unfortunately, due to
the length and discomfort
of the journey, by the time
they'd arrived back at Shandy Hall,
my father had decided
to implement the small print...
"The next birth
shall be at home."
It is infuriating
that Elizabeth
has this humor to...
entrust the life
of our child
to an ignorant old woman
when the admirable Dr. Slop
with all his
modern instruments
is so readily at hand.
Perhaps she does not
care to let a man
that close to her,
um...
Her what?
Say it, man.
By heavens, what's that?
Do you think she's to lay an egg?
You know nothing
of women at all.
Nothing at all.
No matter.
The point is Slop does.
He knows them
inside out.
He has a fine
brass instrum...
Obadiah, you were quick.
- Fortune favored us.
- Dr. Slop.
I only came to borrow
some pipe tobacco.
Dr. Slop!
Where the devil are you
going at such a rate?!
To fetch you, sir.
I was telling my brother about your
fine brass instrument,
the one
with the hinge.
It was new invented.
It's called...
- Forceps.
- Aye, the forceps.
I like the look
of those.
The forceps, they're in a bag
hanging off my bed-head.
I could...
No no, it must
be done properly.
Obadiah!
Obadiah!
I'll give thee a crown
if thou dost hasten.
Thank you, sir!
And I, another!
Susannah!
- Will you take a pipe, Doctor?
- I will.
I'd say we had...
a good deal of piping
at Flanders, Doctor.
Come on!
I meant a pipe to smoke?
Well, if it's smoke
you're after,
then Flanders
was the place...
at the Battle of Namur
- when the cannons were set off.
- Loosed.
"Loosed" is the proper word,
Trim, yes.
Dr. Slop, allow me
to show you a map...
...of such detail
and artistry as to make
a man's eyes water.
I'm here, I'm here.
Here, the City of...
come, Doctor, come...
the City of Namur
as it appeared
to the besieging forces
that morning in 1695.
The English
and the Scots
under the command
of General Ramsey
were positioned
in the trenches to the right.
Now the dilemma
for the good general was...
which way forward?
There were many directions
to choose from.
It is my humble opinion
that he chose the best direction.
No, Brother, what happened
that day to you?
Is everything
all right?
You know...
down there.
Almost there, sir.
Where does it hurt?
Where were you hit?
Sir.
This man's
lost his mind.
I think the injury
may be in a delicate place, sir,
which my master is
too modest to mention.
Damn.
Can a man be too delicate
too name his own privates
yet strong enough
to fight a war?
I shall have you
sent home, sir.
Unless this Obadiah
makes haste,
the thing will befall
us without forceps.
Here he is!
Well done,
sir, well done.
Good man.
A knife, have you a knife?
I have a knife.
Use your teeth,
Dr. Slop.
Your teeth...
oh well.
Ow, my finger!
Now this, Dr. Slop,
is a book
- in which there is a fine engraving...
- I don't want to see
your armies
at Flanders or anywhere,
and if I get my hands
on the blockhead
who tied
these blasted knots,
I'll kick him all the way
to bloody Flanders.
I have a book...
"Colorful Words
for All Occasions."
- Let me...
- I've got you, ma'am.
Now, on cutting the thumb or finger
with the pen-knife.
- There we go, the very word.
- No, I don't want...
by the authority
of God Almighty,
the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost,
and of all Holy Canons,
and of the undefiled
Virgin Mary,
- mother of Our Savior...
- May he be damned.
I'll go fetch
Dr. Slop.
No! No! No!
"Unless he repent him
of tying such knots,
may he be cursed
in his eye,
in his mouth, in his heart,
in his stomach,
- may he be cursed..."
- Doctor, midwife is here.
The midwife is here.
And she's bruised the upper part
of her thigh, here.
I'll come
and look at it.
You'd better look
into my mistress.
You're not fixin' to
use them on the little child?
Yes, this is
the very latest.
With these...
I can extrude
the baby's head
before the mother has a chance
to mash its head to dough.
I can show you.
Captain Shandy,
make a baby's head
of your hands.
You're to imagine
these sleeves
are Mrs. Shandy's...
funnel.
- Funnel?
- Meat curtains.
Meat curtain?
Brother?
My brother knows
nothing of women.
I insert
the forceps thus,
gently enclosing
the baby's head, you see?
And then
I gently... tug it!
Ooh! Agh!
Brother!
By my honor,
Dr. Slop has taken
the skin clean
off the back
of my hand, man,
with your... forceps!
You've crushed my knuckles
to a jelly in the bargain.
Lucky it's not
the baby's head.
A baby's head is naturally as soft
as a path of melon.
It's but a scratch.
- Trim, fetch a melon. Run!
- Yes, sir.
Nothing like
a baby's head.
- Nothing like one.
- Entirely different.
- Melon.
- Thank you, Trim.
Baby's head!
This is a much more
accurate representation.
- Funnel.
- Funnel?
All ready,
and then we merely...
Had my father possessed
a more scientific mind,
the tragedy of my nose
could have
been avoided,
but he was of
a more philosophical bent,
used to arguing
from first principles.
So eventually
when I was born,
I was delivered
with the very forceps
that had crushed
the path of the melon.
The baby's born.
You have a son.
- Congratulations...
- I need something stiff...
but flexible
for a splint.
- A quill, perhaps.
- Ooh, that'll do.
What has happened
to my son?
Doctor needs
to make a bridge.
I'm not finished.
Susannah!
Susannah!
- Doctor.
- Susannah.
Hmm.
What has happened
to my son?
There was
a small mishap.
A mishap with
the machinery.
- Machinery?
- It is the forceps.
He has merely...
broken his nose.
It had ever been
my father's wish
to have a son
with a big nose.
All the great men
of antiquity had big noses,
a nose like
Caesar, Dante,
Pythagoras,
Newton,
Alexander the Great.
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.
I am not yet born.
I'll attend the lady.
No!
Gee!
Deirdre, confound you!
Don't you touch those!
Get off!
Get... back!
My son is
not yet born
and already
I am exhausted.
Should we go and see
the fortifications?
Mrs. Shandy...
Get on the bed.
The bed, woman,
the bed.
There is nothing
more important...
than the choice of name
in deciding
the future of a child.
Four fingers,
- She's four fingers dilated...
- Good.
The highest is Trismegistus
as in Hermes Trismegistus,
the greatest philosopher,
the greatest law-giver,
the greatest priest.
And he was an engineer.
Then you should
call him that, then.
The child should
be called Tristram.
- Tristram, no.
- Tristram.
No, Tristram's the worst.
Tristram is the dog's breath worst...
I know.
How did I come to be named Tristram
given my father's views?
Well, even though my birth
is fast approaching,
there's still
time to catch
the tragedy
of my naming.
Sir, it's the baby.
It's the baby, sir.
He is as black as night.
Black as my shoes, sir.
There, he's as black
as my shoe.
We might lose
the baby, sir.
The parson is here
and his horse.
The baby
must be baptized.
- Yes. Hand me my britches, please.
- No.
There's no time
to get dressed.
My mistress wanted to know
if it should be named after Captain Toby
as he's the godfather.
If my father had been sure
I was going to die,
he would have complimented Toby
by naming me so,
thereby saving the name
of Trismegistus
for one who
might survive.
But he couldn't be sure.
The name, sir,
the name, the name.
- Trismegistus.
- Trismegistus.
You're
a leaky vessel.
Can you carry it the length
of the corridor without spilling?
Trismegistus,
Trismegistus,
Tris...
Tristram Gistus,
Tristram Gistus...
Trisme...
- Tristram?
- No, it's not that, no.
There is no Christian name
beginning "tris" but Tristram.
No, it's not Tristram.
It has some
"gistus" in it.
Tristram Gistus?
Tristram Gistus!
There is no
"gistus" in it, dear.
It is my name and a very
fine name it is, too.
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.
Tristram Shandy.
All is well. Little Tristram is
made right with God.
"...Brethren,
this child is regenerate,
grafted into the body
of Christ's Church.
Let us give thanks
to Almighty God..."
Look, ma'am.
He is well.
He's not
black anymore.
Ma'am, look.
It's a miracle.
You have not
forgotten the name.
No, and the baby is well.
My beautiful beautiful
Tristram Shandy.
Tristram?
My son has been cursed
from the moment of his conception.
Now, I forgot to mention this.
Well, it's not that I forgot.
It's more that I thought...
I should save it until
we knew each other better.
My father had
two domestic obligations
and being a systematic man,
he liked to dispense them both at once.
The first was
to wind the clock.
The second
was more enjoyable.
Walter!
You may be familiar
with Locke's Theory
of the Association
of Ideas.
It's been updated since
by Pavlov and his dog.
If the dog hears the metronome
when he's being fed,
the dog starts to associate
the metronome and food.
So in the end,
if he hears the metronome
even when
there's no food,
the dog starts
to salivate.
A similar association of ideas
took root in my mother's head
between one domestic
obligation and the other.
As soon as she heard
my father winding the clock,
she began to salivate,
as it were.
Of course, it works
the other way around too.
After a while,
if you give the dog the food
without the metronome,
the dog produces
no saliva.
So on the occasion
my father came home
and was feeling so keen
to dispense one obligation
he skipped the other,
he surprised my mother...
Walter.
Elizabeth.
...who was therefore unable
to produce any saliva.
My dear...
My dear, have you not
forgot to wind-up the clock?
So it was the circumstances
of my conception
were as confused
as those of my birth.
Good night.
Yowling won't help.
- How is she?
- It may be some hours yet.
- I can see the head, ma'am.
- Let me see.
- Let me through.
- I'll fetch the...
- No no no no.
- I can't see with the sheet...
That's it, that's it.
Lay her down flat! Flat!
I can't work
like this! Flat!
And... thank you.
Thank you very much.
Okay, that's it.
- We'll pick up tomorrow morning...
- Are we good?
Okay, move
the set piece, please.
Rushes screening at 8:00
for anyone involved in the battle scene.
I can't actually
see the baby's head.
Okay? All right, then.
Mark, we're not doing the...
you don't want the birth today?
No, tomorrow morning.
- That's great.
- This scene's supposed to be
about Walter's
love for his son.
I don't feel very involved,
I feel quite peripheral.
I don't think Mark's read
the book since he was nine.
I'm not trying
to be greedy...
Don't worry, you're
in it, definitely.
I'm not saying that.
I've got to see
Debbie about shoes.
All right, I'll get rid of these
and I'll take you to costume.
- All right, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Should we take
this nose off now
or should we do it
in the makeup truck?
Yeah, 'cause I don't want...
my son won't recognize me.
- Hey!
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Fine, great, thank you.
Oh...
apple crumble
and custard.
They made me eat it.
Steve?
I'll take you to costume
when you're ready.
All right, Jennie,
this is Jenny.
- Hello.
- Hello.
This is Jennie also,
not Jennie too, Jennie also.
Yeah, me and Jennie
were...
flirting before,
but now that you're here,
we're just gonna
stop that for a while.
- Great, good.
- Okay? Good.
She's so beautiful.
- What's she called?
- Thank you.
He's a boy.
- Right, sorry.
- He's called Steven.
- What, Steven like his dad?
- Yeah.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Hello.
- You all right?
- I'm good, how are you?
- I saw you sitting there.
You want to be
in the movie?
Don't, you're
upsetting him.
Sorry, Steve, but Leo needs you
for a couple of minutes
- to try out the womb. Is that okay?
- Now?
Yeah, Jennie'll
take you over.
- So, I've gotta go and do this, baby.
- It's okay.
I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Your wife's
very pretty.
Yeah yes,
she's not my wife,
but a... girlfriend.
Yeah, she's just up
for a couple of days.
Hi, Steve,
thanks for doing this.
- Wow.
- That's the womb.
When you're talking
to the camera as Tristram.
Yeah, I know what it is.
It's just a while since I've seen one.
Did Mark talk to you
about being upside down?
- No, he didn't.
- Ah.
That's what
we need to try out.
Real wombs don't have
a window like that, though, do they?
- Womb with a view.
- Womb with a view.
So that's
very good then.
Tell my mother
I'm sorry for everything.
You'll be fine.
You can let
the walls out now.
Hey hey...
that's wrong.
Okay, I'll try
the other way.
Yeah.
Okay, lower him down.
That's it.
I just kept getting
caught a bit.
That's it,
open the walls out.
Right.
That looks great.
- It looks good?
- It looks great.
You've put on weight.
- Eh?
- You've put on weight.
I've not put on weight.
If I'm a fetus going off
to kick and stretch,
that's what
fetus... feti do.
Yeah, not when
they're full term.
You see the baby
just about to be born,
so he'd fill
the whole space.
He'd be upside down
and his head would be wedged
in the mother's pelvis.
How about filming
the other way around...
the right way up,
and then just flip the image?
Well, maybe,
but I'd have to have
a word with
Mark about that.
I mean, I think he
wanted the realism.
- He wants realism?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm a grown man
talking to the camera
in a fucking womb.
- Okay, all right, get me out.
- Get him out.
Please, just get me out, he's...
he's a dick!
- That's fine, Steve.
- All right, pull... get me out.
- Get him out.
- Please...
No, you jam me...
you're jamming me!
Whoa! Easy! Easy!
Easy, easy!
- You all right?
- Yeah yeah.
That was great, Steve.
Really really good.
- Well, good.
- That's gonna work perfectly.
I think the clothes
make it tighter.
It'll be all right
on the day.
- I'm not doing it naked.
- Well, that's how babies are.
But babies don't
have to be funny.
I think you'd
look funny naked.
Every man thinks
less of himself
for not having
been a soldier...
- Dr. Johnson.
- Yeah, well, you are one now.
He would definitely
have worn a hat.
He would
have worn a hat.
- Well, I've got a hat.
- No question about it.
I hate the hat.
Yes well, you're not
Uncle Toby, are you?
You're...
Rob Brydon.
Ah, that's it.
I was trying to tell
my wife about you,
but I couldn't
remember your name.
Hi, Steve.
Hi.
This is... in the reshoots
for the big scene.
I'm not in
the battle scene.
No.
- What do you think?
- Not bad.
- The hat's a worry.
- It's historically accurate,
so we have to wear it.
I don't like it either.
- Jennie?
- Mm-hmm?
- Can I get a coffee, please, love?
- Yeah, sure.
- Rob, do you want one?
- Yes, please, can I have a macchiato?
- Okay, I'll try.
- Thank you very much.
Actually, Jennie,
can I have...
one of those as well?
Yeah, okay.
- Shoes.
- Shoes.
You worry because yours
are different from Toby's.
It's not that, it's...
Walter in all the scenes with Toby
is supposed to dominate.
This would have been
covered in powder.
Because of the heels,
it comes across that I'm...
because I'm shorter,
I'm overcompensating,
like I've got some
Napoleon complex, you know.
So you don't
like the shoes?
So we just have
to vomit on them.
I should dominate totally
in those scenes.
It should be like
I'm Gandalf and he's Frodo.
"You shall not
have the ring."
Very good,
very good, Rob.
- I do Steve as well.
- Can you?
Can we just sort
the shoes out first?
"Can we just sort
the shoes out first?"
I've got a big house
in the Hollywood Hills.
Look at my pole!
See, that's Alan Partridge,
I don't speak like that.
- I don't talk that way. Yes, I do.
- Stop it!
So, Rob's too tall.
- Or you're too small.
- No no no.
No, Rob's shoes
are too high.
Rob's short.
That's a good thing.
- Hmm.
- That's why he was hired.
The problem's
continuity because
we've already shot quite
a bit with these shoes.
It should stand straight.
These are just too floppy.
This is not an ego thing.
It really is...
it's... the shoes are
key to the character.
The character's soul...
It's coffee,
but it's not macchiato.
Well, I don't understand
why I'm here then,
in that case.
- Great, okay.
- They want you to do it in costume.
- Is that all right?
- This is wrong.
This is
the wrong shoulder.
You would fire
from that shoulder.
Let's just try and get
the hats on them.
Aha!
I'm not a happy boy.
Right.
- Hey, Jennie, thanks. I'll take over.
- Hey.
Thanks.
- Thanks, Johnny.
- All right.
Tony thought it would look good
if we had some crew in the background.
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.
- How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you.
Can we start with knowing me,
Tony Wilson, knowing you Steve Coogan?
- Now, how is that?
- Let's rise above that, shall we?
- Okay, you're right.
- No, it's just...
it's something a TV series
did a long time ago,
and I'm trying to like...
sort of...
- change the record.
- All right.
Okay, sorry,
my fault, my fault.
I did Rob yesterday
and he does a fantastic
impersonation of you.
They said, "When you got to make it
like Steve, make it like Steve Coogan."
Well, Steve,
no matter what he's doing,
is basically...
Oh, you're so dirty.
I mean that's basically
whether he's Walter,
whether he's Tristram,
whether he's Steve,
or he's Alan Partridge,
it all boils down to that.
Steve's hero is...
is Roger Moore.
And Roger Moore's
style of acting
is not a million miles
away from Steve's.
Yeah, I see...
impression I see as
a sincere form of flattery.
He pretends he's taking
the piss, but he...
he loves me, really.
He's very
obsessed with me.
Steve Coogan,
why "Tristram Shandy"?
This is the book that many people
say is unfilmable.
I think that's
the attraction.
"Tristram Shandy"
was a...
post-modern classic
written before
there was any modernism
to be post about.
So it was way
ahead of its time
and, in fact, for those
who haven't heard of it,
it was actually
listed as number eight
in "The Observer"'s
top 100 books
of all time.
That was
a chronological list.
Right. Okay...
If you want to see
the EPK interview,
it'll be part
of the DVD package
along with extended versions
of many of the scenes
which should act as footnotes
to the main film.
It is Tristram's story.
It's called "The Life and Opinions
of Tristram Shandy."
So I guess it would
be Tristram's story,
whatever else
you might hear.
Steven Coogan,
Tristram Shandy,
thank you.
Thank you.
- Okay, thanks.
- Great.
I was so pleased when
I heard you were doing this.
It's my favorite novel.
- Really?
- Yeah, I just love it. It's fantastic.
Who's playing Widow Wadman?
It's my favorite character,
Widow Wadman, in the book.
- Right, she's not in the film.
- No?
- No?
- It's a great love story.
I know, in the book
it's a great love story.
But there's
so much in the book,
so rich, they've
gotta... you know...
- It's sad, I understand.
- Loads of stuff in it.
You've got time
for a drink?
The missus is here,
- so...
- Don't you worry.
Let's catch up
in Manchester.
All right, mate,
great seeing you.
Lovely to see you again.
- All right, boy.
- Keep it up.
- God bless.
- All right, good luck. Thank you. Ed!
Oh, Mark, I need to talk
to you about something.
- Shoes, yeah?
- Yeah yeah.
There's a bit
of a problem.
- Talk to Debbie about them.
- Okay.
We'll have a look
at rushes as well,
go over the battle stuff.
- Okay, it's a status thing.
- No, I understand.
- Well, 8:00, is that right?
- Yeah.
Steve? Steve, can I
grab a lift with you?
The minibus has gone
and left me stranded.
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you very much.
- Just hop in the back.
- All right.
- It's quite chilly, isn't it?
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Brrr.
Sorry, Steve.
Blocking your way.
I would do a screen test
for Alexander Payne, yeah...
Steve, so would I.
So would Rob Brydon.
Okay, I'll see you
back at the hotel. Okay, bye.
- Sorry, that was my agent.
- My agent as well.
She just wants to talk
to me about some scripts...
- from America. Yeah.
- Oh, right.
Fuck you, asshole!
Fuck you,
you son of a bitch...
asshole,
fuck you.
I'm taking you down.
I hate battle scenes.
I think they're boring.
I just don't understand why
they're bothering to reshoot this one.
- It doesn't make any sense to me.
- I couldn't agree more...
I mean, there is
so much in that novel.
Why would you
choose that?
- Do you know what I mean?
- Exactly exactly.
Why not choose Widow...
what's-her-name?
No no, 'cause that's
a love story, isn't it?
Love stories are just as boring
as battle scenes.
What is...
what is so original
and exciting
about the novel
is the "Tristrampedia."
Where Tristram...
No no, it's where Walter
spends the entire pregnancy
like compiling
this book of knowledge
like an encyclopedia,
just for his son.
The Jewish custom
of circumcision
came to the Jews
by way of Egypt
or possibly
from the Syrians
or the Phoenicians
or the Capadocians,
which suggests...
that Zola and Pythagoras
and Ptolemy
were all circumcised.
If they submitted to it,
why not you?
I think that's brilliant.
Yeah, I loved
the dedication
that Walter shows
to his son
and I identify
with that.
And then
you know, like,
Tristram grows up
and he's nothing like
his father wanted him to be.
It just all goes wrong,
like we all go wrong.
Because ultimately,
the way we turn out is just all
- a matter of chance, you know?
- Yeah.
I mean, like,
for instance,
my mom spent her entire life
dedicating herself to me.
She washed, she cooked,
she cleaned, she ironed,
she worked
in the evenings.
- She made her life a fucking misery.
- Yeah yeah, right.
You ask yourself, "What... what was
that all about?"
- The road.
- Yeah, sorry.
I mean, yeah,
but you know,
You do ask yourself, "What is that
all about?" You know?
That should be
in the film.
You know, originally
I was gonna play
Tristram and Walter.
Yeah, that's when
it was gonna be a sitcom.
God, look at them!
This is gonna be massive.
There's loads of them.
They've all brought
their own tents.
I didn't know they had
caravans in the 18th Century.
Steve? Steve?
How are you
doing, man?
Knowing me, Gary Wilson,
knowing you, Steve Coogan.
- It was eight years ago.
- I know, but everyone loved it.
- I know they did.
- We met on the set
of "Around the World" and in Cannes
for "24 Hour Party People."
- Oh right.
- What a night that was, eh?
Well, I can't remember it,
it must have been.
Yeah, indeed.
I spoke to Adrian,
your agent, yeah?
I'm doing a profile on you for Sunday.
He's here,
so I'll talk to him.
Yeah, great.
Good guy.
- Hello!
- Hello!
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?
Nice to see you... aw...
Nice to hear us.
You look fantastic!
- Really good.
- I look dreadful.
No, you don't.
You look like a mom
who's having
to do everything
because her husband
is away filmmaking.
She's got
a nanny.
But she has a nanny,
so that's good.
Yeah. I'll
see you later.
- I need to go to the rushes.
- Okay.
I'm going to try
and get him down.
Can you give us
a hand?
I'll go see Adrian
for five minutes
- then I'll come back.
- Okay.
See you later.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.
- You just missed Jenny.
- No, I just saw her.
Do you mind if I just have five minutes
to talk with Adrian?
- Do you want me to go?
- Yeah.
- Everybody's there, you should go.
- All right.
- It's nice to see you.
- Catch you later.
- See you later.
- Do you want a drink?
Yeah, can I have
a vodka tonic, please?
Mm... catering
must be good.
It's just it has
all these running snacks.
All snacks and no running
by the look of it.
- I'm sorry about Gary being here.
- Yeah, I just saw him outside.
He's a very
unpleasant man.
Do you remember anyone
called Heather?
- Gobbler?
- Gobbler.
She's a lap dancer
and by the sound
of what she says
you'd got up to in your hotel bedroom
on the 20th of January.
You ought to be able
to remember her.
Oh fuck.
- Did you have sex with her?
- No.
- Drugs?
- No.
- You didn't have sex with her?
- No.
No, you didn't?
No... I did.
Anything weird?
Mm...
- no.
- Good.
She's trying to sell
her story to Gary's rag.
That's why he's here.
I promised him a feature
if we can limit the damage.
He just wants
to do a big spread
on how your life
has completely changed
since you've had a baby, you know,
very soft and fluffy.
Well, I'm not able
to do that, so...
- Well, just think about it.
- It's using my son.
- I'm not gonna do it. It's not proper.
- All right.
Just do it.
It's done and it's over.
- It's just...
- I know.
Here are those scripts
from America.
The best of
the bunch is HBO...
an English aid worker
who loses his memory
and falls in love
with his own daughter.
I've read it.
It's rubbish.
It's just...
it's TV...
- At HBO they do a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm too young to play someone
who falls in love with his daughter.
You'd have to be
a pedophile.
I mean, you gotta try
to think two films ahead.
Don't I need
two films for that?
Yeah well, that's what
we're trying to do, isn't it?
Well, there you go.
I'm gonna see Jenny
- 'cause I've gotta...
- The scripts.
Ah, the scripts.
Yes yes.
I'll add those
to the rest.
Okay, I'll see you
at the rushes.
- See ya later. Bye.
- See you guys later. Thanks.
Steve, Steve...
this is David Ingoldsby.
- A genuine 18th-century soldier.
- 17th century.
You look good
for your age.
The point is they've got
hundreds of enthusiasts
and they're all willing,
able and... cheap.
- Mm.
- Well, we'd do it for nothing,
- to be honest with you.
- Don't tell him that.
He'll have have you
doing it for nothing.
It'll be great to have a photograph
with you, though,
'cause I'm a huge fan.
- Fire away.
- Do you want me to take that?
- Just point and shoot.
- All right then.
Dave's just been in
"Around the World in 80 Days."
- Any battles?
- Well, not really.
It was a Jackie Chan film.
Tell him...
Do you know that
the best battle scene
is in "Lancelot du Lac"?
You know... yeah, that's right,
the Bresson film.
It's just there are
these two knights
and they're both
encased in armor,
and they just keep
clobbering each other.
You know,
it goes on forever.
You're just hitting
and hitting.
It's actually like a metaphor for life,
you know?
It's about the impossibility
of actually connecting
with another
human being,
because we're all wearing
these carapaces,
this casing,
this rubbish, really.
And the more
they hit and hit,
actually,
the less they impact.
It's-it's just...
really really moving,
actually.
Mm-hmm, wow.
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, see you later then.
See you later.
What was all that about?
Yeah, she's a bit
of a film nut.
You should hear her
when she's on about Fassbinder.
- Fassbinder?
- I've got a list
of the men
that fell...
92 died
that morning,
so your chap was lucky
to be alive.
I could fix up your lot
with real, accurate names,
and then they can shout out
their names to each other
in the heat
of the battle.
- What do we think?
- Thank you. That would be really...
Have you seen
"Cold Mountain"?
- Yeah.
- What do you think?
I thought
it was good.
I thought Nicole Kidman
was a bit old,
- but I thought it was a good film...
- No no, the battle scenes.
Oh, fantastic!
Very very good.
That explosion
and when he jumps down...
- That was the best one.
- It's shite!
Utter shite
from beginning to end.
Woefully inaccurate.
Right.
We wouldn't be interested
in participating
- in a pantomime like that.
- Right.
Splishy-splashy water.
Look at you go!
Ooh! Oh God!
Oh dear.
- Will you bathe me later?
- No, I won't,
though you could
do with one.
- Those are pheromones.
- Uh-huh.
Can you do
the cot up?
A lot of women
find that sexy.
Daddy's gonna put
your cot up.
Ooh ooh ooh...
What's this?
Bach.
It has a calming effect
on babies.
My parents never
played me Bach.
They played me
New Seekers.
I turned out fine.
You like Bach,
don't you?
Yes, it makes you happy.
- Jenny?
- Yeah?
Do you think I should have
my nose straightened?
Oh God!
Do you think I've got a character
actor's nose or a leading man's nose?
I think it's your nose.
I think when
the time comes
I'm just gonna have
a chin tuck
and then leave it
at that.
Shh!
He's just nodding off.
No, don't answer it.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Sorry to bother you,
but they're screening the rushes now.
When you're ready...
Okay, I'll slip into
something more comfortable.
- What is it?
- I've gotta go see the rushes.
- Sorry, baby.
- Do you have to?
Yeah, I won't be long.
At least I don't
smell anymore.
These bottles
are filthy.
Probably quite expensive.
You'd think someone would clean them.
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you doing?
- Okay.
- How are you?
- Good.
- How are the kids?
- Good.
- How many is it now?
- Seven.
- You've got seven children.
- Yeah, seriously.
One for every day
of the week.
See, now there's a good Groucho Marx
story about...
see, he meets a woman
with seven children
and says, "Why've
you got seven kids?"
And she says,
"Because I love my husband."
He says, "Well, I like my cigar,
but I take it out now and again."
Here's Mark.
Okay, let's sit. Great.
- Have you got the tape.
- Uh no...
Mark's put together
a rough assembly
of the battle scenes
and, as you all know, we had
very little money when we shot it.
We're all agreed that we have
a possibility of a very exciting film,
but with a slightly
small hole in it
where the battle should be,
which we need to reshoot.
But we can talk about that
after we've seen what we've got.
Okay, Peter,
I'll do the lights.
Mel Gibson's not
gonna lose any sleep.
The model is more
impressive than this.
Stand by cannons
to reload!
I am leading literally
tens of men.
- This is a pole vaulting scene?
- I think what we need
is a bit
of a score under it.
- Quite right.
- Who's the music composer?
We haven't made
any decisions about that.
That's great.
Well done, everyone.
Everybody, that's where we are now.
If anybody wants
to say anything?
I think that the...
that scene,
because it looks so cheap,
it actually makes it funnier.
It works 'cause it's funny.
Well, it's not
supposed to be funny.
Toby's supposed to be funny. The battle
is supposed to look like a battle.
You look really really good
in your costume.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you looked great.
There's a problem
with that too
'cause some of the lead costumes
are out of period.
They're about
50 years out of date.
I think I saw a Roman centurion
at one point.
You either go for proper,
full-on "Braveheart"...
clearly,
that's not an option...
or you go for "silly man
in a comedy battle"
which is well within
our grasp.
The thing is
we need to reshoot it.
Gotta have the battle scene
or haven't got a whole movie.
Oh no, but wait a minute.
I was reading through
some of Joe's old drafts. There never
was a battle scene, was there?
- No.
- What about the chestnut scene?
Do you remember when you
asked us to finance the movie,
you acted out a scene
where you dropped
a hot chestnut
down your trousers.
I mean, that's why
we gave you the money.
Ahh.
Went well,
I thought.
Except it's not Walter
who does it, is it?
I mean, it won't be Steve
doing it in the film.
Wait a minute, Joe.
You're serious?
- It didn't matter though...
- I've been practicing that for weeks!
First I tried to
keep it small,
then I pushed the idea of him
struggling to control the pain.
Then I just went for
lots of energy.
That looks good.
We can try that.
Do you wanna try it
with a real hot chestnut?
Try it
with a real one.
Just an experiment to see
the general reaction.
Agh agh fuck!
Shit! You put...
fuck! Fuck!
Agh, get it out, please!
Get it out!
Please, please!
You've got your hand
on my fucking knackers!
Get off! Agh!
Get off! Get off!
Get your hand out!
Jesus, man! Fuck!
Ow! Fuck!
It's out.
Fuck...
- Do you want some water?
- Fucking hell!
I'm all right,
I'm all right.
Fucking hell.
Fuck. You had your fucking
fingers up my asshole!
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do that.
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking hell, man.
- I'm very sorry.
- It's... you know...
Take me
to dinner first.
- Fuck.
- Sorry.
We've all seen
battle scenes before,
but how many times have
we seen a chestnut scene?
I think we need
more of Uncle Toby.
Uncle Toby's character is
the strongest character,
it's the heart and soul
of the piece,
the funniest character
in the book.
The battle scene
is Toby's scene, so...
That's irrelevant.
The bottom line is
how much will it cost
if you want to...
Well, we think we can
pull it down for 100,000.
See, I think the audience
that will come and see this film
is not interested
in big action scenes.
Anita, this is what
we don't have.
We don't have
the luxury of time.
These guys are out there now,
in uniform, loading up the muskets.
Don't try and hold us
to ransom about this.
We need to go and think
and talk about it...
Why don't you take
Anita and Greg off
and chat about the things
you need to chat about?
- See you, Steve.
- Go.
There's a shoe issue.
It is an issue of status.
Are you coming with us?
Turn the lights
out, please.
See, you can hardly
see the shoes.
I don't really see
what the problem is.
It's important characterwise
to see the height difference.
It tells the seniority
of the characters.
Is there anything
we can do about that?
- Um...
- Are you all right?
Yeah, we can um...
take an inch off
Rob's heel
and put a thicker sole
on Steve's shoe.
- You all right with that?
- That would be great.
- Okay.
- I'll do this. Thanks.
Let's get some lights on.
Steve, are you coming
to the meeting?
- Well, that was thrilling...
- Steve.
Steve, Gary's waiting
in there.
He's been waiting
for about 20 minutes.
I'll see you around.
Listen, I've got to
talk to this guy.
Five minutes
and I'll be up.
- Whenever.
- I want to talk to you.
Sorry, love.
Listen, I'm very sorry
about the other night, okay?
It was last night,
actually.
Oh, well...
since I was drunk.
Just so I know,
are you sorry
because you kissed me
or are you sorry
because you were drunk?
- Which is it?
- Uh... both.
Slightly less sorry
I kissed you
because it was
very nice,
but I don't think
it was, uh...
- Anyway, I'll leave you guys to it.
- Okay.
Hey!
All right,
buddy.
- How are you doing?
- You well?
Yeah, good
to see you.
Right, are we good?
I've gotta go
to a script meeting
and I've got to do this sort of
dad-kind-of- boyfriend thing.
Great. I'll take a picture of you
and the baby.
So can we postpone this
till tomorrow morning?
No, no...
you can.
But I've got to be
honest with you,
everyone at the office
wants to run the story about the girl.
You don't want that
because it's just weird stuff.
It's not weird,
just embarrassing.
She's saying some stuff
about me... anyway...
I want to
play ball too.
All right,
so if you can give me...
Yeah, 7:00 A.M.
Tomorrow morning.
I don't think
they're gonna go for that.
What do you
think's better,
the chicken
or the beef?
These rooms are fantastic,
aren't they?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm in the Charles I suite.
Apparently
he stayed in there.
Yeah, just before
he was beheaded.
- Is that true?
- Yeah.
Would you like
a drink, Steve?
Uh yeah, I'll have
a vodka tonic, please.
Can we please just talk
about the script?
Even if we get
the battle scene shot,
then we're still
going to be under.
It's a big book.
Plenty to choose from.
Think I'm gonna have
a lamb shank.
Given that the story's about
Walter's love for his son...
- Here, put this in.
...I really think
that Walter should be there
at the birth.
It's the 18th Century.
Men just didn't do that.
You're a 21st-Century man,
but Walter can't be.
He talks to the fucking camera.
He can be emotional.
If you saw Walter for an instant
holding the baby in his arms,
then you would forgive him
all his flaws?
Yeah, but it would
look terrible.
It would be like the scene
in "Robin Hood"
where Kevin Costner
delivers a baby.
Because he's got
a stupid mullet haircut.
Remember all those scenes that you
pitched when we first talked about it?
Like the black page
when the good
Parson Yorick dies...
the book has
a completely black page.
I don't know how interesting a black
screen is going to be for an audience.
The original cover
for "Anarchy in the U.K."
Was inspired
by that page.
- But Yorick isn't even in the film.
- He used to be.
Hardly anybody's in the film.
That's the problem.
I like the black page. That's one
of the arty bits I actually like.
Why do we want to spend
a year of our lives making this film?
- 'Cause it's funny.
- Is that all?
Is that not enough?
If it's genuinely funny,
that is enough.
It has to be
genuinely funny.
Well, what was
all that stuff Patrick told us
when we visited
Shandy Hall?
The theme of "Tristram Shandy"
is a very simple one...
Life is chaotic,
it's amorphous.
No matter how hard you try, you can't
actually make it fit any shape.
Tristram himself is trying
to write his life's story,
but it escapes him
'cause life is too full, too rich
to be able to be
captured by art.
And his father Walter
tries to plan every aspect
of Tristram's birth,
conception, childhood and so on,
and his plans
all go wrong.
Walter puts it this way...
Did any man ever receive
so many lashes?
Walter is indeed
the most unfortunate of men,
and if his life
could be celebrated,
then so too
can all of ours.
What about Widow Wadman?
I've been pushing for that
since the start.
Widow Wadman,
that's a romantic comedy.
- That's bollocks.
- Who do we have for the Widow Wadman?
She might be free.
Okay, Beth
and Sam?
- That's good.
- Gillian Anderson.
We know that
she loves the book
and Mark met her
in L.A.
- Did you, Mark?
- We couldn't afford Gillian Anderson.
She'd cost more than
the whole battle scene.
No, but Gillian Anderson
is an American film star.
I think, actually,
she's Canadian.
It would make it a real movie
if it had a real star.
Two stars.
I don't see myself
as a star.
I'm a craftsman,
like a medieval craftsman.
- With a Porsche.
- Plying your trade.
Yeah, I'm a medieval
craftsman with a Porsche.
Two stars...
I was just thinking
that's gonna be
the review.
"'Tristram Shandy,'
two stars.
Jonathan Ross.
If she needs
to meet...
We can't get her
something in time.
Well, I've only
written three drafts
with the Widow in it.
I've got to see Jenny.
- See you later, Steve.
- Yeah.
- Bye, Steve.
- See you later, Steve.
Jenny?
Hey... hey...
hey...
hey, aw, hey...
hey...
Oh, dear dear dear.
Oh, there you go.
Oopsie-daisy.
Fur ones, not the ones
full of polyester
'cause
they're shite.
- Ah, yes!
- Hey!
Hello!
Sorry, I was just changing
the baby's nappy.
We heard it all.
It was very lovely.
We'll do
a musical next.
Oh I see, you've been
eavesdropping on me.
We're celebrating.
Brilliant idea,
mates.
The money men
are lapping it up
- Gillian Anderson said yes.
- Really?
We only spoke about it
five minutes ago.
I know, but I phoned
her agent in L.A.
- Joanna, hi.
- Hi!
I'm calling about
"Tristram Shandy."
- We're in the middle of filming.
- Yes, I know.
I read the script.
I love it!
Great! I wanted to talk to you
about Gillian Anderson.
She's right here.
- Oh, hello! Mark's right here.
- Hi!
- Hi, Gillian? Hi.
- Hi, Mark!
Remember I was telling you
about "Tristram Shandy"?
Oh, I love that novel.
We've decided to include
the Widow Wadman in the story.
Yeah, I love
that character.
You know what a great fan
I am of yours.
Oh, that's so
sweet of you.
Obviously
it's a low-budget film.
- Oh, don't worry about that!
- That's fine.
Gillian's interested
in the quality of work.
She's not looking
for a payday.
- That's right.
- Great. We'll need you right away.
- I can fly tomorrow.
- Okay, bye.
- Okay, bye!
- Bye.
Oh yes.
Jesus,
that was easy.
Yeah, that worked well.
So she's coming
over tomorrow.
That's fantastic.
Is Gillian Anderson
the one in "Baywatch"?
That was Pamela Anderson.
We've already got
one blonde with big tits.
- I love you.
- Thanks, but just a bit too hard.
I love "The X-Files."
Do you know
Rasputin had a wart
on his penis?
Listen, thank you
so much for the champagne.
That was lovely.
Bye.
- Good night.
- Night to all.
Good night, just going to have
a bit of sexual intercourse.
Thanks for the details,
thanks very much.
I don't think
that's their baby.
I don't know,
it just seems so unreal, so perfect.
She's very good for him,
I tell you.
She is very grounding
for him, don't you think?
- Steve?
- Jesus Christ!
Sorry sorry. Can I have a very
quick word with you?
How long have you
been there?
I've just been waiting for you.
Sorry, Jenny.
Just two minutes.
I just need to talk about something.
- Sure, yeah.
- Fine.
Thank you.
Have you heard
the news?
They're trying to get Gillian Anderson
to play Widow Wadman.
I know.
That was my idea.
- Was it?
- Well, not the Gillian Anderson bit,
- but the Widow Wadman thing.
- You know how I feel
about Gillian Anderson.
I've got posters of her.
I think the woman's
an angel.
I've got all of
"The X-Files" on DVD.
- I don't understand.
- Do you want a drink?
Yes, please. I'll have
a vodka tonic, please.
- The thing is I can't act...
- I know that.
...with Gillian Anderson.
I have a proper sexual thing
for Gillian Anderson.
I covet her. If I have to do
a love scene with her,
I will blush.
But Toby would blush.
That's good. Channel that.
That's method acting.
Yeah, right.
- Cheers.
- Here you go.
I don't know
why you're worried.
You don't have that
many scenes with her.
They're putting the whole
of the love story in.
Steve, you've read the book.
It's 100 pages.
You have given me
a love story
with my favorite,
my ideal woman,
my perfect
10-out-of-10 actress,
and I am going to
be stammering
and stuttering
my whole way through it.
- Wait wait...
- Thank you.
Um... I've got to go
talk to Jenny.
Oh, listen, Jenny mentioned
about this stuff...
it's not been as good
since the baby and everything.
- What, did she?
- All men lose their libido.
I don't...
no, they don't...
Rob, I don't have
a problem with my libido.
I just don't have
the fucking time.
For fuck's sake.
"I have no problem
with my libido."
Have you seen
my book anywhere?
What book?
"Tristram Shandy."
Which book do you think?
Here it is.
What are you doing?
Come here!
Can you believe a book
as thick as that
hasn't got an index?
It's a novel,
not a cookbook.
It's Book Six.
How'd you know that?
And Book Eight
and Book Nine.
- So you knew before Rob did?
- What are you talking about?
Rob now has
a bigger part than me.
- Bet he hasn't.
- But he's got a battle scene
- and he's got Agent Mulder from...
- Scully.
And he's got big heels.
And you've got me
and you've got a baby
and you're playing
Tristram Shandy.
Yeah, I am playing
Tristram Shandy
in "The Life of
Tristram Shandy."
You know what? At the end
of the book, he's not even born.
- Who told me that? No one.
- Steve,
I have traveled 200 miles
by train with a baby
just to have sex
with you.
Look, honey, this is
not about my libido.
It's... I've got to...
"Presently I hope I shall be
sufficiently understood
in telling the reader
my Uncle Toby fell in love."
- Fuck.
- She's a wealthy widow.
She sees Toby.
She falls for him, but she's
worried about his equipment.
"...has fallen in love,
deeply in love,
up to the ears
in love."
If it is not intrusive,
Captain Shandy,
I'm agog as to what actually occurred
at the Siege of Namur.
I have a model
just yonder
of the city as it appeared
to the besieging forces
on that morning
in 1695.
You interest me strangely.
The English and the Scots
came out of trenches on the right.
I'm quite perspiring
with anticipation.
You must know,
Captain Shandy,
that I have taken
an interest in you.
But before we go further
on that matter,
I must reassure myself
of your fitness
for marriage...
of the state
of your equipment.
Would you like
to see my model?
I must know exactly
where you were injured.
Madam, I'll show you
the exact spot.
Are you sure?
You can put
your finger on it.
- Just beyond the asparagus.
- Yes, quite right.
Out of the way.
I'm flattered,
Captain Shandy,
that you would take me so far
into your confidence.
I received my injury
at nine of the clock
right here.
That was great.
Thank you.
Rob, this is Steve
from "The New York Times."
Hey, I'd love
to do a piece on you.
That was a really
good job by the way.
You!
- Was it good?
- Yeah, it was great.
Where's Steve?
I really wanted him to see that one.
Steve's over there.
Hello!
Rob? Rob?
Did you hear my laugh?
I heard a laugh.
- Steve Coogan? Hi.
- Hello.
Very pleased
to meet you.
Sorry about this.
I didn't realize
you were so small.
A lot smaller than me.
Come and see how small he is.
This membrane looks like
it's about to burst.
Then there'll be
a huge muscular spasm.
Agh!
Oh my God!
It's the funniest thing
he's done for years!
It's just disgusting.
I don't know why
I'm so small.
- Neither do I.
- I didn't realize he was so small.
He really is small,
isn't he?
- He's tiny.
- Rob?
- Rob?
- That's his actual size.
Rob, I thought
you were a mate!
You should go to L.A.
And spend some time there.
I'd want to go. I'd want to meet
as many as I can...
You should. You're going to be hot
after this movie...
I just wanted to apologize
for the fact that this is a complete
historical cock-up.
And in order to make it
a bit more fun,
I'm gonna give everybody
a character name, okay?
- Yay!
- So, Eli Thrift.
Free Fornication Williams.
Feichmann,
have you got a mic?
Well, then you shouldn't be
wearing a gorget. Take it off.
Okay, Efrain Greenwillow,
- you can have that.
- Have you heard?
They're so chuffed
about Gillian Anderson,
they're going to give us some money
for the battle scene as well.
- That's great.
- And Joe has had an idea
for the birth scene, so you can go there
when the baby's born.
Oh, brilliant. That's great.
Where's your pretty wife,
Steve?
Come on!
- Hello.
- So they're going to have love story
and the battle scene.
That's great.
It's like some Hollywood version
of "Tristram Shandy."
Yeah, Fassbinder
would have never sold out like that.
You know Fassbinder?
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow!
Which is
your favorite film?
The whole...
the corpus,
the bloody work.
"Fear Eats the Soul."
Yeah.
There's more truth
in that title
than there is in most whole movies,
you know?
- Yeah.
- But the thing is
he's such like
a powerful writer.
You know
"Schatten der Engel"
That is my favorite.
- Do you know that one?
- Is it the one with all the sex in it.
No, it's the one where Ingrid Caven
is this prostitute,
but the thing is
that she's so beautiful
she doesn't even need
to touch the punters.
They're just happy
to, like, sit in her room
and just look at her.
The thing is that
humanity is so disgusting
they kind of, like, invade
and pollute her with their problems
and their insecurities
so that in the end,
it's actually better for her
to just fuck them.
You know, it's cleaner
for her to fuck them
than it is
to listen to them.
You're watching the movie
and you're, like,
"Just fuck them, Lilly!
Just fuck them!"
- Do you know what I mean?
- Fuck them.
Fill me
with your babies.
What what what?
What did you say?
What did you
just say?
I don't know.
I think I said, "Fuck me."
- I think.
- The thing is...
no, you said
something else.
That's not
what you said.
It's what I meant.
Listen, um...
you are fantastically
attractive
and your knowledge of
German cinema is second to none.
But... I've got to
get back to Jenny.
I've got work
in the morning,
it's an early start.
6:30 A.M. Call,
I think.
Yeah so...
good night.
Yeah, good night.
I am Spartacus!
Push on!
I am Spartacus!
I am Spartacus!
Jennie, I am Spartacus.
I am Spartacus.
- I am Spartacus.
- I am Spartacus!
Where have you been?
You're freezing!
I had a nightmare.
I missed you.
I missed you.
I love you.
Steve, it's time
to get up.
Morning. Your car will be ready
in half an hour, okay?
Right, thank you,
Jennie.
- I'm sorry.
- He'll be okay for a couple of minutes.
God, you're
so lucky.
This morning's headlines...
Americans have conceded
that the insurgents in Iraq
are as strong now
as they were a year ago.
More foreign terror suspects
are expected to be freed on bail today
as time runs out for the existing powers
under which they're detained.
And what Churchill
thought of India
and what India
thought of Churchill.
Today's newsreader,
Charlotte Green.
A senior American general
has said the insurgents in Iraq
have lost none of their capacity
to launch attacks
on Coalition and Iraqi...
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Hi.
Rob, did you want me
to get you some breakfast?
- Some coffee?
- I'll have a coffee.
- Okay.
- Everyone's here?
Yeah, they are, actually. Do you
want me to get you some breakfast?
No no, I'll go with you.
Been here for ages.
Top o' the mornin'
to ye.
...but once I get the other sock...
- See you.
Morning, uh...
- Rr-r...
- Rob.
- Rob.
- That's it, well done.
It's the shoe business,
you know?
It goes on all day
between Steve and Rob.
I've got the shoes
for you.
They've been built up
so you'll feel a lot taller.
Be hard to see Jennie.
She's a bit... intense.
Very. Hard work.
Do you know
this shoe thing,
I think we're fine
as we are.
I spent all night
working on it.
- I think we've got spare ones.
- Sorry, love.
We got spare ones here.
- Okay.
- Sorry, love. Thank you.
- Um, Steve.
- Well handled.
This is the coat, Steve,
for the scene where
you take your wig off.
- Want to just try it on for me?
- Sure.
- All right, love.
- Take your wig off with the right hand
and pull your handkerchief
out of your right-hand pocket...
- This is actually weird.
...with the left hand.
- I mean, that's...
- You look like Lee Evans.
It looks like
the pockets are too low.
It looks like they've been placed there
for comic effect.
Shall we say it looks
like a rain suit?
"In the latter end
of Queen Anne's reign,
and the beginning
of King George I,
coat pockets were cut
very low down
- in the skirt."
- The pockets can be built
technically accurate
and still look contrived.
It's historical,
but it's not
hysterical.
Yeah.
- Hey, Joe!
- Hello, Steve.
Listen, I'll see you
tomorrow.
I'm going to
get the kids
- to see the battle.
- Brilliant.
How'd the
birth scenes go?
- All done, yeah.
- Fantastic.
Trying to get the impact of having
a baby on Walter,
your physical
and emotional impact.
- Yes!
- You all right?
- Yes, very well.
- Listen, we've gotta get a shift on.
I need to do something.
Hiya.
I'll need to get a train,
so can we just find somewhere...
I'm gonna need
five minutes for Gary.
- 10 minutes.
- Sorry.
Does Mark know
about this, Steve?
He doesn't know.
Tell him not to worry.
I just wanna do
a really general piece,
you know, the type of thing
I'm sure you've done before.
- Yes.
- Steve Coogan the actor,
Steve Coogan
the family man.
And with the novel
being called
"The Life and Opinions
of Tristram Shandy,"
I thought we'd call the piece
"The Life and Opinions of Steve Coogan."
- Great. Tidy
- Yeah.
Just a sort of tidy...
exactly.
But really, obviously
you've just become a father.
- Yeah.
- So let's do a little bit
about the family to start off.
What does it mean to you?
Well, it's everything to me.
- Hi, babe.
- Hiya.
- How is he?
- He's a bit... grumpy
- this morning.
- Sorry.
Sorry.
Steve, we've got
your other baby next door
if you'd like to come and say hello,
do a bit of bonding.
That's Walter's
little baby.
- I'll explain later.
- It might take a minute.
Okay.
See you later, love.
See you.
I've got the new sides
from Joe...
- Good.
...for the scene as well.
He spoke to me
this morning.
- He's very pleased with it.
- Great, I'm pleased.
- This is Rachel.
- Hi.
And little Tristram.
- Oh...
- I'll catch you later.
Okay, right. He's got a better
hairline than me.
She's a girl, actually.
I hope that's not
going to be a problem for you.
No, I'm very in touch
with my female side.
Everyone miked up?
Yeah, with
the time we need.
Okay, all right.
- Ed?
- Yes, sir.
Let's get it
all locked up.
Yeah, okay. Byron, can we just get
this moving now? Thanks.
She likes you.
She's very happy.
Hey! Aw...
She's so small.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
They're ready for you
on the set.
Oh...
that's Mommy.
Okay, I've just got to
say goodbye to Jenny,
just say goodbye.
Three days in a row
you've been screaming.
It's only one more day.
It finishes today.
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?
Hello.
Could we get Steven?
Thank you.
I'll try to stay awake.
Joe has written in
this part of the scene
where Walter's there
at the birth of Tristram.
- It's really important.
- It's fine.
Steve, there waiting
for you on the set.
Okay, all right.
Listen, have
a safe journey.
- I'll see you on the weekend.
- Okay.
Would you have had
a baby with me
- if I'd really had a nose like that?
- No.
I'll give you a call
when we get there.
Okay, I love you.
- It doesn't seem right.
- No, it's wrong.
Okay, sorry about that.
I'm just a bit confused.
Are we supposed to...
It's not continuous.
We've jumped in time.
We've jumped in time.
We're going to take that moment
where the kid's
about to be born...
- Right.
...from here.
So this is
the very end of it.
Very end of it.
- Okay?
- Right.
Hi. Um...
all right.
Hold the work, please.
Hold the work.
- So, Steve?
- Yeah?
We'll have about
40 seconds of...
effort before
your entrance, okay?
Say, what's
happening?
All right,
his head's here now!
We're just about done.
Okay, Steve.
A little more, ma'am.
A little more.
That's it.
That's it, ma'am.
That's it.
He's handsome, ma'am.
He's a handsome... boy.
He's a big boy.
Thanks very much,
everybody.
There's a drink
through there,
so... if you'd like
to go on through.
- What happened?
- Um...
So what do you think
about that?
- Can you tell that's not me on horse?
- Yes.
- Do you ride a horse?
- Yes, I rode a horse.
You look like you'd never
been on a horse before.
You were funny,
you were charismatic...
- Charismatic?
- You looked so dashing.
- I looked so dashing?
- You did.
I was dashing.
I dashed.
What happened to
the whole Widow Wadman story?
How much did you do?
I shot like two weeks.
I mean, the house is
way too big for Shandy Hall.
Well, that's what they wanted to make
the film look sexy.
I thought you look fantastic,
by the way.
- And you.
- For what it's worth.
- Yeah.
- All right.
See you in a bit.
- Great, just great.
- Ah, yes.
Thank you,
rather good on that.
I thought we were gonna get
the big emotional scene
with Walter
and his baby.
Yeah, well,
the 18th Century...
- it didn't work.
- We thought the scene
with Steve and the baby playing
young Tristram would give us the emotion
and still be true
to the original story.
I always forget
how short I am.
I can't believe that was
the whole fucking movie.
I think we look like
a nice couple, don't you?
Where is
the battle scene?
Yeah, where's the battle?
It wasn't funny.
So how many drinks
do you have a day?
I have... I don't know...
a number.
And I purposely have
a pay-to-go,
and I only keep
£10 on it
so that I can't stay
on the phone long.
That way I'm just
quickly off.
- How does the book end?
- The book's got a great ending.
- Parson Yorick.
- Mm?
Why are we so delicate
about the subject of passion?
Why do we put a candle out
when we try to make a child?
I'm not sure.
Everyone does put out a candle,
Sir Walter.
Though you see, Walter,
not everybody does put the candle out.
I have on occasion asked for the candle
to be left, but...
Be that as it may,
why do we glorify the act of killing
that's destroying a man?
We honor the weapons
with which we do it.
We write about them.
We paint them.
- Obadiah.
- Good evening, Parson Yorick.
Has that cow of yours
calved yet?
Well, that's just it.
My cow has not
calved yet.
Will thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife,
to live together...
It so happened that
Obadiah was married
on the same day my father's bull was
introduced to his cow.
Now the custom was
that my father's bull
served all the cows
in the parish.
But the truth was,
the parish was so large
my father's bull
was not equal to the task.
But as he went about
his business
with a grave face,
my father regarded him
very highly.
When the baby was born,
Obadiah hoped
the cow would calf.
- She didn't.
...both water and wine.
May not a cow
be barren?
- Never happen.
- My bull is as good one as ever pissed.
If you attack his character,
you attack his life.
Good Lord, what is
this story all about?
Cock and a bull story.
Cock and a... bull.
- Mm.
- Cock and bull tale.
Cock and bull's tale.
- Cock and bull.
- Cock and bull.
- Brother.
- Sorry.
And the best of its kind
I ever heard.
I like it.
I thought
it was good.
That's the area,
that's the area.
- Right there.
- Okay okay.
What do you think?
A little piece?
- A piece?
- Rob, I've seen enough.
It's registered
logged.
- But how big is it?
- There is hair,
- but it's very thin hair.
- I know, I know!
Just trace
with your finger
- the actual area.
- You're actually asking me to do that?
- Fuckin' hell, mate.
- Just trace the area.
All right,
I'll just trace it,
from like that.
I'm just tickling the area.
Oh, I can feel that.
That's good.
Can you arrange the hair
that's there
- to cover it?
- No no no!
'Cause I'm working
in the dark.
Well, I'm not going to talk to
your fucking head, Rob.
Did I do more
Al Pacino
in the car scene?
- I remember.
- You did a lot more.
You remember me
doing a lot more?
- I have to say I'm...
- Sad to see it go.
It served as a counterpoint
to the stuff Naomie was doing.
- It did?
- I'm in the dark.
I do a good Al.
"Shylock is my name."
- Did you see him in that?
- Yeah.
I do a good
Al Pacino too,
but I don't do it in front of people
all the time.
Because you don't have
the confidence.
- I understand.
- I do.
- I feel I can get up there and do it.
- I can do Al Pacino.
I can do like Al Pacino
in "The Godfather."
That wasn't great.
My friend...
When the Godfather
speaks like this,
"You disrespect
the family."
- The Godfather talks like this.
- The Godfather speaks like that.
You have no depth
to the way you speak.
Because there was no depth
in those days, in those days...
You know, you sound
like a cartoon now.
That's not what I'm doing.
- With respect...
- The Godfather...
- Let me do Pacino.
- That's the way I do Pacino.
- Just let me do Pacino.
- That's the way. I was fucking loud!
Like that!
It's real fucking loud!
A big sound like that
all the fucking time.
That's Columbo.
L-l-l-l... I'm very open.
I model myself on Pacino.
You can see it on the screen.
You see it, in fact,
when I lean against a wall.
Tha... that's Pacino.
When I do a look of shock,
that's Pacino.
Are you being serious now
or are you joking?
We're in the same business.
I'm not showy.
That's the last thing I am.
I look for truth, and that's why
I go to Pacino,
that's why
I go to Hopkins.
But no, I go
to actresses as well.
I go to Streisand.
I go to Streisand.
I regularly go to Streisand.
I say,
"What can you give me?"
And I look at
her body... of work,
so I have a little bit
from "Hello, Dolly!"
I'm going to take
a little bit from "Yentl,"
and put them together,
a whole...
she would say in Jewish,
and off I go.
So I've got Streisand
underneath me,
I've got Hopkins,
I've got Pacino.
You tell me
where I can't go.
What do you think?
I've had them done.
- I know you have.
- What do you think?
Feel that one.
Look, no crevasse.
- Feel it.
- Don't ask me to feel your teeth.
- Just close your eyes and feel it.
- No.
It's your
fucking teeth. Christ.
You've got a thing about... whenever
there's a hint of something gay...
What? This has nothing to do
with "gay."
That's what it is. You don't want
to touch another man's teeth
because you're worried you might
be attracted to me. Just touch my teeth.
- It's good, it's good, it's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.
