We had a pretty good idea
going into this prosecution
the kind of individual
that Mr. Avery was.
I think that what Mr. Avery
did to Teresa Halbach
should, uh, speak volumes as to the
kind of person that Mr. Avery is.
That's why I'm very happy that
the citizens of Manitowoc County
won't need to worry about Mr. Avery
being on their streets anymore.
In the Penny Beerntsen case,
Steven Avery went to prison
for something he didn't do,
and everybody was convinced
that he did it.
And lo and behold, hey,
here's, uh, evidence beyond
doubt that he did not do it.
But in the Halbach case,
investigative techniques
and interrogation techniques are much
better today than they were then.
Around here, the feeling is
Steven Avery got what he deserved
and he is where he belongs.
Back behind bars for
the rest of his life.
They ruined us.
They ruined our business.
I always thought Avery
was a good name.
They knocked the name
right down to nothing.
This one's worse
than the first one.
There's no family
here no more.
I don't talk to hardly
nobody anymore.
I don't think we're
going to, really.
To get over this.
Unless he can get out.
<i>I didn't think I was ever gonna
get arrested again in my life.</i>
<i>And just, boom.</i>
<i>It took a lot...
to keep my sanity.</i>
<i>I gotta prove my innocence
again, just like my first case.</i>
<i>Once I prove my innocence, that clears
me and Brendan and my whole family.</i>
Any metal?
<i>When you appeal it,
when you ain't got no money,</i>
<i>then they give you
appellate attorneys.</i>
<i>The appellate attorneys,</i>
<i>they gotta find a loophole that
what they did, it's not legal.</i>
We are here on the defendant's
post-conviction motion.
I will note for the record
the defendant is...
What I'd like... He always got...
He's got the same judge, yeah?
That scares me.
All we can do is
hope for the best,
but I got a hunch, anything, it'll
have to go to appeals court.
That's my...
I hope I'm wrong.
Ma's got a lot of hope
for a new trial.
The courtroom today
was full of family and friends
from both the Halbachs
and the Averys.
Today's hearing is essentially
to ask the judge
who presided over the trial
to change his mind.
Judge Willis expects to issue a
written decision by December 1st.
And Avery's nephew, Brendan Dassey, has
also filed some post-trial motions.
He'll have hearings similar to his
uncle's beginning January 15th.
They always have everything
ready for me when I come.
It's such a small prison, you know,
the parking lot's really small.
They see my car drive up and
they got everything out for me.
Everything all set up.
My badge out there.
Everything all ready.
Have to laugh. It's...
It's not good to be known
that well in a prison.
I started writing to Steven
after watching the trial,
thinking that they couldn't
possibly convict this man.
And then when the
verdict came back,
I just wanted to let him know
that I supported him,
and I truly did not believe
that he did it.
<i>I talked to her a few
times over the phone...</i>
<i>and then she wanted to come
to Boscobel to see me,</i>
<i>so I put her on the
visiting list.</i>
I went down there with the thought
that I could be a blessing to him
and it turned out
that he was a blessing to me.
He helped me through a lot
with my husband's illness.
My husband had dementia
along with Parkinson's.
And Steven helped
me through it.
And he always tells me
it worked both ways.
We encouraged each other.
<i>It was just a friendship
at that time.</i>
<i>But Sandy, she was there for
me and she believed in me.</i>
<i>So I fell in love with all of that,
and I fell in love with her.</i>
Several months after
my husband passed away,
my friends told me that there was
more going on between Steven and me
than what I wanted to admit.
And I remember when I
went to see Steven,
I said, "I've been told that
there's more to our relationship."
And he says to me, "You mean, you
haven't felt it all this time?"
Those were his exact words,
and I said, "No."
<i>She likes everything I like.</i>
<i>Sandy's mostly the important
person in my life</i>
<i>and you might
figure, my future.</i>
In '85, they only took
my brother away...
for something he didn't do.
And they knew it.
And now...
they took my brother
away and my son.
If Steven would've did it, I think
he would've confessed by now.
If he did it.
And he hasn't confessed.
And that's what he did with the first one
when they sent him away for 18 years.
I believe he's still innocent.
And I know my son is innocent.
Brendan Dassey is
now 19 years old
and spending the last part
of his teenage years
at Columbia Correctional
Facility in Portage.
Dassey's new attorneys say
he should have a new trial.
The jury did not hear
a lot of evidence
which would've explained to them
why Brendan confessed to a crime
that he did not commit.
I had heard about this case
from the get-go.
When Steven Avery was arrested and
charged with Teresa Halbach's murder,
that was big news in
the innocence world.
When Brendan was arrested, that was
immediately on my radar screen
because it was one of the first
video-recorded interrogations
in the State of Wisconsin,
and I had been involved
in the litigation
that led the Supreme Court
to require videotaping.
Steve Drizin has made his life
work studying false confessions...
so I was very pleased that
somebody with the resources,
the experience and the credibility,
especially on confession issues,
took over the case.
That was huge.
It was at that point I was willing to
step in, um, just to watch them work.
See them do what they do
and to be a part of that.
What we argue
in our post-conviction motion
is that Brendan's pre-trial
attorney, Len Kachinsky,
violated his duty of
loyalty to Brendan.
Every attorney in this country owes
a duty of loyalty to their clients.
That's part of the
constitutional right to counsel.
And what happened in this case
is that Attorney Kachinsky
took steps to essentially coerce
Brendan into pleading guilty.
And we argued that Attorney Kachinsky's
behavior is absolutely intolerable,
that no court in Wisconsin should
sanction that kind of conduct
and that Brendan should
get a new trial.
You were appointed, was it
on March 7th or March 8th?
- March 7th.
- March 7th. OK.
Did you talk to Brendan on
that day, on March 7th?
- I don't believe I did.
- OK.
However, you did talk to
the press, is that right?
Yes, shortly after the appointment, the
calls started rolling into the office.
Sure.
I want to draw your attention to
a news report from Channel 26
that says, "We have a 16-year-old who,
while morally and legally responsible",
was heavily influenced by someone
that can only be described
"as something close to
evil incarnate." Right?
That's what it says I said,
but that wasn't me.
OK. Um...
Is there anything about this
statement that bothers you?
To say that we have a 16-year-old who's
morally and legally responsible,
that would in
effect admit guilt
and that is something
you should definitely not say.
Just for the record, Your
Honor, Mr. Kachinsky testified
that he did not
make those comments
and this exhibit is being
introduced as impeachment evidence
to demonstrate that in fact Mr.
Kachinsky made those comments.
The court will receive it.
Attorney Len Kachinsky immediately
lashed out at Steven Avery.
We have a 16-year-old who, while
morally and legally responsible,
was heavily influenced by someone
that can only be described
as something close
to evil incarnate.
And, uh, the next day,
you make the statement
that "if the confession is valid
and admissible as evidence",
it would almost certainly
result in a conviction."
- Right?
- Correct.
OK. You still hadn't reviewed
Brendan's statement, right?
- No. That's correct.
- That first statement?
- Correct.
- All right. March 10th appears to be
the first time you went
to see him, is that...?
- That sounds correct.
- OK.
And when you got out
from that meeting,
the press was there
waiting for you, right?
- They were there waiting when I got there.
- OK.
- Yes, they were.
- All right.
I want you to refer to an
interview with you from NBC 26.
It says that,
"Kachinsky says at this point
"he hasn't ruled out negotiating
a plea deal in the case." Right?
- That's correct.
- OK.
And how did that advance
Brendan's case?
Because I knew that Brendan's
family was watching these newscasts
and so in effect it was a message to
try to get them accustomed to the idea
that Brendan might take a legal
option that they don't like,
so part of the intended audience
was Brendan Dassey's family.
- Yeah...
- And Brendan himself.
About his only contact with the outside
world was, uh, visits with his parents
- and, uh, television.
- Yeah. Now...
Brendan's best interest was to demonstrate
that he had his own moral compass.
And he wasn't necessarily the
pawn of the Avery family,
that he could make his own moral
decisions as to what was right or wrong
under all the circumstances,
and part of that would be to
admit being involved, you know,
in the death of
Teresa Halbach.
During that meeting with
Brendan on that day,
uh, he told you he
didn't do this. Correct?
I believe he did.
And he told you
that what he said
and what was in the complaint about
what he said was not true. Correct?
- I believe he said that.
- OK.
And he also told you at that time that
he wanted to take a polygraph test
- to prove that, correct?
- Oh, correct. Yes.
OK. So Brendan is
asserting his innocence.
- Yes.
- When he talks to you.
Imagine if you were in
Brendan's position,
a 16-year-old charged with one
of the most serious crimes
you could possibly
be charged with.
You're intellectually limited, you may
not understand what's happening to you.
You may not even understand the difference
between your attorney and the police.
And imagine that the one person
who is supposed to defend you
against the entire State of Wisconsin
believes that you're guilty
despite the fact that you're
telling him that you're innocent.
Are you set to proceed, Mr.
Dvorak?
- We are, Judge.
- Go ahead.
I would call Michael
O'Kelly, please.
Mr. O'Kelly, come on up here, take
the oath, and then be seated.
Yes, Your Honor.
Michael O'Kelly
was an investigator
that was hired
by Len Kachinsky
to give Brendan a
polygraph exam.
But Mr. O'Kelly's
role grew and grew
in ways that, to me, highlight
how Mr. Kachinsky was not interested
in what Brendan had to say.
He was only interested in
getting Brendan to plead guilty
so Brendan could be an asset for
the prosecution against his uncle.
At some point, you went out and
started to gather evidence, right?
- Yes.
- OK.
Let's go to exhibit number 64.
And is that an email that
you sent to Len Kachinsky?
- Yes, it is.
- April 27th?
- That's correct.
- All right.
Go to the paragraph where it
says, "I am not concerned."
"I am not concerned with
finding connecting evidence"
placing Brendan inside
the crime scene,
as Brendan will be State's
primary witness.
This will only serve
to bolster the prosecution.
Brendan's truthful testimony
may be the breakthrough
"that will put their case
more firmly on all fours."
So your goal is not only
to get Brendan to confess,
but to also go out and gather evidence
to help the State in its prosecution.
- Correct?
- That is correct.
Even if that evidence
tends to inculpate Brendan.
- I... Yes, that's correct.
- OK.
Now you're working for Mr.
Kachinsky at this time, right?
Yes, I am.
And you're also working for Brendan
Dassey at this time, correct?
- Brendan is my client. Yes.
- OK.
And what you're talking about
here is securing evidence
that would be useful to the prosecution
in prosecuting Steven Avery,
and you make reference
to Brendan's testimony.
That's correct.
This kind of cooperation
between a defense investigator
and the prosecution
is unheard of.
- You all set?
- Yep. Thanks very much.
So in a sense, they were
working for the prosecution.
They were working for the police
and working for Mr. Kratz
to build their case
against Steven Avery
while at the same time
damaging Brendan's chances.
And it all came to a head
on Friday night, May 12th.
Len and O'Kelly decide that
they want to visit Brendan
as soon as the court rules
on his motion to suppress.
If Brendan loses his
motion to suppress,
the confession is coming into
evidence and the case against Brendan
is gonna be much
harder to beat.
In the scope of the case, that's one
of the most important decisions
and they knew that Brendan
would be at his lowest point
when he learned that
that confession was coming in.
All right. Stop there.
This is a picture of a ribbon
hanging on a tree.
Oh, sure, yes. Um...
I believe it's Teresa's
church in the background.
- OK. And that has...
- God, I apologize.
OK. All right.
Now you laid those things out prior to
Brendan coming into the room, right?
- Oh, yes.
- All right.
And this is part of your plan to get
a statement from Brendan, correct?
- To get an admission? Yes.
- All right.
I want to refer you to your email
to Mr. Kachinsky on May 9th.
Would you read from
the third paragraph?
"Brendan needs to be alone."
When he sees me this Friday,
I will be a source of relief.
He needs to trust me in the
direction that I steer him into.
We need to separate
him from fantasy
"and bring him to see reality
from our perspective."
Was all of this done pursuant to
instructions from Mr. Kachinsky?
Oh, sure, yes.
From the first shot
where you see this table
where he had this picture
of Teresa Halbach...
and the church and the ribbon,
what a production. My God.
The extent and the level
to which he went to...
coerce this confession.
It was just amazing.
You know, it's everything
that you talk about.
All the methods to get
an unreliable confession.
It's clearly where
his heart was.
Tell me how you start that email
to Mr. Kachinsky on May 9th.
"I am learning the
Avery family history"
and about each member
of the Avery family.
These are criminals.
There are members engaged
in sexual activities
with nieces, nephews,
cousins, in-laws.
Customers or their relatives unwittingly
become victims of their sexual fantasies.
"This is truly where the devil
resides in comfort."
I just keep thinking about
that blue ribbon. I'm sorry.
"I can find no good
in any member."
These people are pure evil.
A friend of mine suggested, 'This
is a one-branch family tree.
"Cut this tree down. We need
to end the gene pool here.'"
We saw things that I think have never
been seen before in a court of law.
I can't think of another case where a
defense attorney and his investigator,
um, plotted to pressure their client to
plead guilty to a case that he was...
in which he was
expressing his innocence.
That tape was somewhat
disturbing, I think.
It was extraordinarily disturbing and
Michael O'Kelly is a seasoned investigator
and I believe what he did to
Brendan Dassey traumatized him.
So the first question
you have to ask yourself is
do you want to spend the
rest of your life in prison?
So is that a yes or a no?
- I can't hear you.
- No.
All right.
Do you want to get out
and have a family someday?
Well, that means
you have to cooperate with me
and help me work with you.
O'Kelly is using these tools
to break Brendan down,
to get him to confess again.
And he finally succeeds.
Draw a picture of the bed
and how she was tied down.
But draw it big-sized
so we can see it.
And the first thing he does is he picks
up the phone and he calls Len Kachinsky.
Hi, Len?
Hi, Len, this is Mike O'Kelly.
I'm with Brendan right now.
Oh, quite well. Quite well. Very well.
He's given a detailed statement.
And then they arrange for Brendan to be
interrogated again the next day on tape
by the very same police officers
who manipulated him before, um...
without Len Kachinsky
being present.
I was told by your attorney that
you wanted to talk to us...
So on May 13th,
these investigators,
they think they're
gonna get gold.
They think they're gonna get
a confession from Brendan
that is gonna be
a game changer.
It's gonna have
even more details,
it's gonna lead them
to new information
and that Brendan is now
gonna be their star witness.
But what do they get instead?
They get crap.
At what point did you put her cell
phone and camera and purse and stuff
in the burn barrel?
- I didn't.
- OK, who did?
- Probably Steven.
- No, not "probably." Who did?
If you know, you
need to tell me.
You were over there.
- Steven did.
- Did you see him do it?
- Yeah.
- No, honestly, yes or no,
did you see him do it?
Don't lie about it.
If you did, good.
If you didn't, good.
Did you see him do that?
No.
This is somebody who obviously
doesn't know what to say.
And is obviously saying
whatever he thinks the officers
and his defense attorneys
want him to say.
And the resulting story is widely
different than what he said on March 1st.
What's happening is he's just generating
more and more conflicting statements
and essentially muddying up
the State's case.
So they come up with a plan and
the plan is to persuade Brendan
to call his mother
later that evening
and to talk to her
about his role in the offense.
When are you gonna
tell your mom about this?
Probably the next
time I see her.
'Cause you've lied to
her so far, right?
Don't you think you should
call her and tell her?
- Yeah.
- When you gonna do that?
Probably tonight.
Don't you think she'd like to hear it
coming from you rather than from me?
- So you gonna do that?
- Yeah.
- When you gonna do that?
- Tonight.
Probably be a good idea,
before we tell her.
At the time that you had suggested
to Brendan that he call his mother,
you knew that calls from the
jail were recorded, didn't you?
- Yes.
- OK.
And you wanted Brendan to call his mother
and to repeat what he had told you.
- Is that right?
- Yes, for several different reasons.
One of those reasons was that
you knew that if he did that,
that conversation could be introduced
against him in court. Is that right?
No, it was not our thought
at that time.
Our thought was we were
dealing with Barb constantly.
She would be on our side,
she'd be with us to help us
and then she would be mad
at us, things like that.
Um, we wanted
Barb's cooperation.
That was the purpose of that.
Did you suggest to Brendan that
perhaps, if that was your objective,
that he might ask his mother to come to
the jail to speak to her about that?
- Did I ask Brendan to do that?
- Yeah.
- No.
- Basically, what you said here was that
unless he called her that night
that you would tell her.
- Isn't that right?
- That's true. Yes.
And so Brendan complied.
He went back to his cell and he called his
mother on the recorded prison telephones.
And he said to her,
"Mom, Michael O'Kelly"
and Mark Wiegert
think I'm lying.
They told me if I say I did this,
I won't be doing life in prison.
"And I might even get out
to have a family."
Those are things that didn't
come from the police,
those are things that
Michael O'Kelly told him.
So Brendan is explaining
to his mother,
"My defense team is telling me
I need to say I did this."
And that's what he
tells his mother.
He says, "Mom, I
did some of it."
And she says, "Brendan, how could you
possibly have done some of this?"
I saw you at home at 5:00 p.m.
on October 31st.
"You weren't over at Steven's.
You were at home."
And he says, "Oh, well, I went
back to Steven's after I saw you."
That's important because the State used
that May 13th recorded telephone call
against Brendan at trial.
And it would've never come
about, never come about,
absent the actions of
attorney Kachinsky.
They weren't supposed
to use those statements.
There was a gentleman's agreement
that this was a lost weekend
because Len Kachinsky allowed Brendan
to be interrogated without counsel.
But they used them.
They got greedy.
And they used them in a way that was
very powerful and persuasive to the jury
and almost ensured that
Brendan would be convicted.
And when he got back at 5:00...
he could've told his mother.
As we know in the call,
and as she rightly noted, "I would've put
you in the car and we would've left."
But he goes back.
We know he goes back because he tells
his mother in those phone conversations
ten weeks later on May 13th and May 15th
that he went back, that he was there.
They set Brendan up.
Who's there for Brendan?
He's all alone.
And that's the main reason
why he deserves a new trial
is because the actions
that his own attorney
and his investigator took
so damaged his chances
of ever winning this case,
that he needs a do-over.
<i>Judge Willis,
he wasn't on my side at all.</i>
<i>I knew I wasn't gonna
get no play from him.</i>
<i>He thought I was
guilty anyway.</i>
<i>I'm just waiting for the
next step, you know?</i>
The governor of Wisconsin has called for
the resignation of a state prosecutor
after the prosecutor
admitted to sending
more than 30 sexually
suggestive text messages
to a domestic abuse victim
whose case he was handling.
The scandal
remained quiet until last week
when the Associated Press
revealed the text messages.
"I'm the attorney," he wrote.
"I have the $350,000 house.
I have the six-figure career.
You may be the tall, young, hot
nymph, but I am the prize.
Are you the kind of girl
that likes secret contact
"with an older married elected
DA, the riskier the better?"
<i>When I heard about Ken Kratz
and his sexting, I thought,</i>
<i>"Well, Ken Kratz,
that's his ethics."</i>
I intend to continue to serve as the
Calumet County District Attorney...
Stephanie Van Groll reported
the harassment to the police,
who turned the case over to the
Wisconsin Department of Justice.
They chose to take very
little action against him.
New details tonight about
a text messaging scandal.
Now we are learning
that Kratz took steps
to try to keep that case
from going public.
<i>I guess
the Justice Department knew</i>
<i>about a year before
they put it out.</i>
<i>They stick up for
their own people.</i>
Governor, why did it take a year
for this to be made public?
At least five women
have come forward.
The office of lawyer responsibility
closed it out without doing anything.
What is going on in the Wisconsin
Department of Justice?
I had gone from being one of the
most respected DAs in the state
to vilified and hated
and altogether forgotten.
There's a huge
disconnect there.
I mean, the judge did
remove Kachinsky
because he had allowed Brendan
to talk to the police
without him being there.
But if he did that, he should also
have suppressed the statement
that was used to
impeach Brendan.
To recognize on the one hand
that a lawyer is ineffective
and then allow the fruits
of that ineffectiveness
to be used to the admission of another
confession, I mean, it's a problem.
It's a serious problem.
Brendan tells me
they treat him OK.
I mean, he plays games
with the other inmates.
And he does his schooling.
He's trying for his
high school diploma.
I seen him yesterday.
It was nice.
We played 61 games of Uno.
I think he misses everybody.
Talks about babysitting.
That he misses doing that.
Talks about playing
his Nintendo.
They should be outta there. They
don't belong in the prison.
Put the ones in there that done
something, not the innocent ones.
Them cops should sit there for
a while. Like about 50 years.
And see how they feel
and how their family feels.
We still love 'em.
Yep.
Always.
<i>I always feel like they
kicked me in the gut again.</i>
<i>You only got maybe a second there
to realize you lost again,</i>
<i>then you got another step
and the Supreme Court,</i>
<i>and you get your
high hopes up.</i>
<i>They should've did something.</i>
<i>They should hear it because
the case don't make no sense.</i>
<i>You always get let down
by the court system.</i>
Of all the years that I've known him,
this is the roughest I've seen him.
He just seems hopeless
and depressed, I say.
I don't think he
can cope anymore.
Boscobel is a prison
for violent criminals
and Steven has never
been violent in prison.
So the least they
could do is move him.
Getting out of where he is,
I think that's what
he wants right now.
And of course eventually
out the door.
Is there anybody
sitting at this table
that thinks that regardless of what
procedural chances he still has...
- he has any substantive chances?
- Certainly, if we could do a test today
that was scientifically
acceptable and valid,
that actually proved there was
EDTA in those blood stains,
- that would be newly-discovered evidence.
- Right.
That might be the
ticket to a new trial.
It's interesting, the parallels
with Steve's first case.
- Right.
- What ultimately freed him
was newly-discovered evidence
where the technology advanced to the
stage where you could test the DNA.
And in this case, we're looking for
technology to do the same kind of thing.
To show that, uh, the evidence
at the original trial
really did not mean what the
State was arguing it meant
and what the jury
believed that it meant.
Or some other
newly-discovered evidence.
Other people who
know something.
I'm still hopeful that someone with that
kind of knowledge is gonna come forward.
I've still got my suspicions about...
whether something improper occurred
during the deliberations.
I gotta tell you. I mean, if
I'm gonna be perfectly candid,
there's a big part of me
that really hopes Steven Avery
is guilty of this crime.
Because the thought of him being
innocent of this crime, um,
and sitting in prison again...
for something he didn't do, and
now for the rest of his life
without a prayer of parole,
um... I can't take that.
And Brendan Dassey, um...
they had a demonstrably
untrue confession
from a seriously
compromised kid.
Um...
Scares the hell outta me.
I don't know what the other jurors
are feeling, but... you know...
I know what I'm
feeling is hard.
It is difficult for me.
Even though I didn't make the
final decision on the verdict
because I wasn't there,
it's still difficult for me.
I constantly think
about the trial.
You know, I feel bad that...
I mean, I feel terrible
that, you know...
Teresa is gone, you know,
a life was taken.
But I also on the other hand
feel bad because...
Steve and Brendan's life was
taken from them, basically.
People tell me to just forget
about it. It's over with.
But in my mind
it's not over with because...
I don't know, I think that...
deep in my heart, with all the evidence
and all the things I know, that, um...
whoever did this to Teresa
is still out there.
I always think about Steven's
feelings, how he's hurt.
But I'm out in the open.
It's a little easier to go through
that than when you're in a cage.
That's all he's got
to think about.
I'm sticking by Steven.
And I'm sticking by Brendan.
I picked this house out for
Steven when he gets out.
So he's got somewhere to live.
Looks like a pretty nice house.
It's got fruit trees in there.
Half of his life is gone when
he spent half of it in the...
in the prisons for something
he don't even do.
<i>I asked for all the files.</i>
<i>I'm trying to fight
for a new trial.</i>
<i>But this time, I'm doing it because
this is my life, my freedom.</i>
<i>Now I'm trying to look up cases
and the law in the law library.</i>
He has to go in
without a real good education,
go into a law library and try to
go through all the books he can
to find any examples of what
he might use in his case.
These are all of the transcripts
and case files of Steven's.
Twenty-four boxes-full.
Steve's mom brought them from the
prison and he got copies of everything
to go through his
case bit by bit.
<i>I had, you know,
a couple of boxes in my cell,</i>
<i>then the other ones were
stored in a... in a room.</i>
<i>So when I got done with some
boxes, then I could put 'em back</i>
<i>and get some more boxes.</i>
<i>That's why it's so hard to
work on a big case like this.</i>
<i>You can't have it all
when you need it.</i>
<i>Sometimes in the middle of the night I'd
think of something and I had to go search.</i>
<i>Sometimes you go... you
want to say, nuts.</i>
<i>But something just bugs you
and you gotta do it.</i>
<i>You gotta get up and do it.</i>
<i>I wrote the Innocence Project... if the
Innocence Project would help me again.</i>
<i>I wrote 'em a few times...</i>
<i>but they won't take my case.</i>
<i>Then there's that blood,</i>
<i>if I could prove that it
came from the courthouse.</i>
<i>I wrote to get a
good lab to do it.</i>
<i>I filed my 974.06.</i>
<i>Now I'm trying to get the
judge to give me a lawyer...</i>
<i>so I don't screw up.</i>
<i>I'm still learning,
so I don't know everything.</i>
I gotta give him a lot of
credit for what he's doing
and hope and pray
that it works out.
<i>You might as well figure
I'm doing it all.</i>
Kohlrabi. Huh?
Them are good raw.
Slice 'em thin, put
a little salt on.
Radishes. Onions. Lettuce.
There's lettuce over here.
I know you like lettuce.
Bugs and all.
Tomatoes. Peppers. Carrots.
Asparagus. Cucumber.
Cabbage.
<i>My dream right now
is get out...</i>
<i>buy me a lot of land
and live up in the woods.</i>
<i>Make me a big pond
so I can fish.</i>
<i>Do my garden, and
have my animals.</i>
<i>So I don't have to go
into town and buy food.</i>
<i>I'll have it all right there.</i>
<i>I guess Sandy wants to get
married so I'll get married.</i>
<i>And I'll have my wife,
and then my ma and my dad.</i>
<i>I'm gonna take care of them.</i>
<i>I really don't
need nothing else.</i>
Today a decision from
the State Supreme Court
on one of Wisconsin's
notorious murders.
Yeah, it won't hear a Manitowoc
man's arguments for a new trial.
Brendan Dassey was sentenced
to life in prison
for the 2005 slaying
of Teresa Halbach.
The killing drew extraordinary attention
because Dassey's uncle, Steven Avery,
also was convicted in the crime. The
Supreme Court won't hear the case
after the appeals court
upheld the verdict.
It's the function
of post-conviction courts
and appellate courts
to make sure that the system
works the way it's supposed to.
That where failures
start to happen...
that they do
something about it.
I've always believed it would be very
difficult for Brendan to get relief
in the Wisconsin
State Court system.
This case was just too
much of a heater.
So we recently filed
a federal habeas petition
to try to get his
conviction vacated.
Everybody has the right under the US
Constitution to a loyal attorney.
Everybody has a right
under the US Constitution
to not have a coerced
confession used against you.
Because these are rights under
the federal constitution,
we're asking for federal
review of these claims.
We are hopeful that we'll have a
better shot in a federal court.
The fight goes on.
"Dear people in the world,
my name is Brendan Dassey."
I am writing to let you know
that I am innocent
of the rape and murder
of Teresa Halbach.
I was interrogated by the
police when I was 16 years old.
The investigators kept telling me over
and over they knew I was involved.
They also told me
if I just said I was involved,
they would help me and that
I wouldn't get in trouble.
I trusted them.
I told them a lot of things
that weren't true that day.
I thought I would
go back to school afterwards.
But they arrested me.
I haven't been free
since that day.
I've missed out on high school, graduation
and a chance to get a girlfriend or a job.
My brothers have gotten
married and had children.
I wish I could have a
family someday, too.
I am innocent of the rape and
murder of Teresa Halbach.
Please help me if you can.
"Sincerely, Brendan Dassey."
Steven didn't call on Wednesday
night when he was supposed to.
And then on Thursday
I heard the operator say,
"A call from Waupun
Correctional Institution."
And my thought was, "I don't
know anyone in Waupun."
Who's calling me
from Waupun Prison?"
And then it clicked just like
that, that they moved him.
He wanted us to wait, his
mother and father and myself,
wait a couple weeks
before we came and visited
because he wanted to get acclimated
a little bit to the institution
and know what the schedule was
and stuff like that.
And so we have waited
and now it's time.
This will be the first contact visit
that I have ever had with him.
Ever since I've known
him, seven years,
I have never been
able to touch him...
hug him, hold his hand.
It's just exciting to know that his
parents will be able to hug their son.
The fact that he's
actually at the table
and can talk with us
instead of behind glass...
Dry mouth. I think
I'm nervous.
Little bit anxious.
This... ahh... feelings.
OK. In... Oh, no,
I see it already.
That didn't take
even 45 minutes.
So where do we park?
- What a goddamn place.
- Yeah.
- This is terrible.
- OK, turn this way and turn around.
I can't turn down here, can I?
No.
We did it before!
- Well, I ain't gonna do it again.
- Why not?
OK, now you can park there.
That's close enough.
What have you got in here,
the kitchen sink?
Something like that.
Take your driver's license.
Wait a minute. I got the wrong
card. I had my Sears card.
That wouldn't have worked
too good, would it?
No, that wouldn't work.
I don't think that would work.
When we left now,
I just hung onto him.
And I just... It was so good.
Just to be able to do that.
We asked him about a job here. You
know, this is a working prison.
His response was, "I've got
too many things to do."
He's gotta spend all his time in the
law library and working on his case.
He just can't let it go until something
big happens, something is done.
I hope the day comes where he's
freed, his name is finally cleared
and his parents
are still there.
You know, it's so important to his mom
and dad that he gets out before they go.
Until it happens to you or
to your son or daughter
or someone else that you love,
it's easy to ignore all of the...
the problems in the system.
But I can guarantee you that once
it happens to somebody you love
or to yourself, uh,
it'll be very clear.
Everybody seems still...
to be playing this the normal,
conventional, conservative way,
uh, which is that if the
system has the right lawyers
and if the lawyers
do the right job,
then justice will be obtained
for Steven Avery. And...
I mean, at what point do people start
questioning that whole framework?
I would hope that the people
who watched the trial
and saw really what kind of evidence
the State did and didn't have,
I would hope that those people don't
give up on Steven Avery. Um...
Because this may take a while
to right this wrong.
It took 18 years
the last time.
I certainly hope it doesn't
take another 18 years.
<i>They think I'll stop working
on it and it'll be forgotten.</i>
<i>That's what they think.</i>
<i>But I want the truth.
I want my life.</i>
<i>But they keep on taking it.</i>
<i>So I'm gonna keep on working.</i>
<i>Even if it's wrong.</i>
<i>I ain't gonna give up.</i>
<i>When you know you're innocent,
you will keep on going.</i>
<i>The truth always comes out...
sooner or later.</i>
