Arnie, eat some chicken.
I don't want any chicken, Gilbert.
You want some corn?
- I want some corn.
- Have some corn.
Good?
Not good corn.
Gilbert...
are they gonna come soon?
'Cause I gotta go back home,
you know?
Pretty soon.
I want them to come.
- You wanna go home?
- No.
I wanna see 'em.
They're gonna come soon, huh?
How many more miles
till they come, Gilbert?
- Three million, buddy.
- Three?
- Yep.
- Okay.
That's them, huh?
Look, it's them!
Look! Look over there!
Look at them, Gilbert!
They're coming!
Honk your horn!
Honk your horn!
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 18.
My family's planning
a big party for him.
Watching the campers
is our yearly ritual.
They're doing the right thing
just passing through.
God, Arnie.
You're gettin' so big.
Pretty soon, I ain't gonna
be able to carry you no more.
You know,
you're getting littler, Gilbert.
You're getting littler.
You're shrinking.
You're shrinking, Gilbert.
Endora.
Endora's where we are.
Describing Endora
is like dancing to no music.
It's a town where
nothing much ever happens...
and nothing much ever will.
Lamson's Grocery is where I work.
And miles out of town on
the interstate, there's Foodland...
where everyone else shops.
This is where I live
with my family.
My dad built the house, and it's
my job to keep up the repairs.
Doctors said we'd be lucky
if Arnie lived to be ten.
Well, ten came and went.
Now the doctors are saying...
"Any time now.
Arnie can go at any time."
- Some days you want him to live...
- The head.
...some days you don't.
- What is it, buddy?
- I killed him.
- I killed him, Gilbert.
- I know.
I know, buddy.
My older sister Amy's
more like a mother.
She used to manage the elementary
school cafeteria over in Motley...
until it burned down last year.
My other sister, Ellen,
just turned 15.
She got her braces off, and she's
been walking around going "Ooh, ah."
Like she can't believe
the feel of teeth.
I got another brother, Larry,
but he got away.
And then there's Mama,
who in her day...
was the prettiest girl
in these parts.
Ever since our dad
was hung out to dry 17 years ago...
Mama's had her hands full.
You see, with Mama there's
no nice way to break it to you.
She hasn't left the house
in over seven years.
- I'm Gilbert.
- Ellen, I need your help.
- What is it?
- Gilbert Grape.
Sunshine? Where's my sunshine?
I don't know, Mama.
- Just the essentials.
- Okay.
Gilbert, get him down from there.
- Hurry.
- Let's go.
- Amy, have you seen Arnie?
- No.
I thought he was with you.
I wonder where he is.
Gee, I don't know.
Ellen, have you seen your brother?
He's in the tree.
He is not in the tree.
Gilbert already looked in the tree.
Isn't that right, Gilbert?
Yeah, that's right.
Don't do that. You scared me.
Come here.
- I was up there!
- Yeah, you were up in the tree.
I was right up there.
Can I help you with anything?
Thank you, and good-bye.
- Gilbert?
- Sir?
Is something goin' on at Foodland?
I wouldn't know, sir.
I don't shop there. I'd rather die.
I'll tell you, Foodland's
up to something if you ask me.
It's those lobsters, isn't it?
Scads of lobsters all in a tank.
Am I right?
You know,
you shouldn't worry about it.
It's just a phase. People
will come back here, believe me.
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.
The way you say that makes me think
I'm talking to your father.
- Can I have these two?
- No, just one.
- Can I have these two?
- Sure, go ahead.
Say "Thank you."
- Say hello to Mama for me.
- All right. See you tomorrow.
Gilbert? That was Mrs. Carver
needing a delivery.
Could you?
Boys, go on outside.
- But we don't want to.
- Yeah, we don't want to.
Go play.
Get back in the truck.
Keep countin', okay?
Okay. I was counting.
Five, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen...
Hey, kids, let's play!
Come on!
We got the trampoline.
Come on, boys. It's fun!
The ice cream's gonna melt...
soon.
You're right.
It is melting.
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my God.
- Come on up. I wanna show you.
- I don't wanna do it.
- You don't wanna do it?
- I want a pool.
- You want a pool?
- Yeah, we want a pool.
Come on up.
Up, up, up, up.
Gilbert was just making a delivery.
Gilbert, come here for a second.
- Here.
- Oh, no, really.
Oh, no, here.
I insist. You deserve it.
Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Bye, Gilbert.
Come by my office.
We need to talk.
Okay, son, it's a little dangerous
up there. Come on down.
Arnie, get down!
Come on, son.
We've had enough fun for one day.
Come on down.
- Son?
- Yeah?
- Come on down.
- No!
I'm not coming down!
I'm goin' up there!
Son, come on down.
I'm gonna go up there!
- Come on down, buddy.
- Look up here.
Hi!
Okay, son.
Come on down.
I'm gonna go up here!
Come on, son.
I'm goin' higher than before!
I'm goin' high!
It's gonna be getting dark soon.
Come on down.
Hey, Bob.
Yeah, here we go again.
Basically, I don't like
to work on carburetors...
and I can tell
without gettin' into it...
that that is a complicated unit.
I understand. I can do it myself,
but I need the part.
Look, let me show you.
See, it's this
little guy right here.
The needle valve is worn down.
I need a new one.
Can we order it?
Yes, ma'am.
- I can order it.
- How long will that take?
- Probably a week.
- A week?
Don't make us come get you.
You don't have to come get me!
I'm goin' up here!
I'm not gonna fall!
My shoe done fell off.
I know a boy whose name is Arnie.
He's about to turn 18
and have a big party
I know a boy whose name is Arnie.
Come on down, buddy.
Come on.
Match in the gas tank Boom, boom.
Good boy.
Come on down, buddy.
Here we go. Thanks a lot, Jerry.
Really sorry.
Good boy. Good boy.
I'm gonna take him home.
I promise it won't happen again.
We hear this every time.
Then after a couple of days...
he's right back up there again.
But this is the last time.
Right, buddy?
- It's the last time.
- Yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.
- I wanna go back up there again.
- I wanna go up there again.
- Arnie, man, good job.
Don't touch him.
Way to go, Arnie.
Could you do it again for me?
Get out of here.
Could you help me out later
with the fridge?
- With the what?
- Something wrong with the fridge.
- The electricity?
- I don't know. Maybe.
All right.
I have to get my tools.
I'll just come by later.
You be careful, all right?
Don't disappear like that
again on me, okay?
I disappeared on Mom like that.
- Please don't disappear.
- Just let him go.
- Will you bring the milk?
- I promise, Mama.
Good boy. Good boy.
The food.
Are we ready
to talk about the party?
- Sure.
- Ellen's in charge of decorations.
Purple, orange and green.
- Sounds good.
- Theme colors.
That sounds pretty good.
I'm doing the food, the cake.
Arnie, I'm making something
very special for you.
And Mama,
you can supervise everything.
- Okay with everybody?
- That's disgusting.
- Sounds good.
- What about me?
You are the guest of honor.
How about that?
What about me?
It's my party!
You just show up, buddy.
That's your job.
- All you have to do is show up.
- You don't have to do anything.
All you have to do is turn 18.
You know, that just leaves Gilbert.
You're the only one
without anything to do.
- Got any ideas?
- Sure he does.
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.
I'm almost 16,
and I've got pages of ideas.
She designed a whole cake,
and you haven't done anything.
- Stop it, Ellen.
- Can I be excused?
- He never does anything!
- Can't we do something as a family?
- This is no fair!
- Can I please be excused?
- We're planning this as a family.
- It's my party though!
So it's gonna be an exact copy of
the original they built in Boone.
- Really?
- Which is no big deal.
All Burger Barns
are built identical.
They're prefabricated.
They just ship 'em out.
It's so efficient.
It's amazing.
In a matter of a couple days...
there can be
a whole new restaurant.
So I was driving past
the building site today.
You know, it's goin' up
right down the road from Foodland.
The general manager was there.
So I says...
"Can I fill out an application?"
He said, "You bet you can."
So I did, you know,
and it looks really good.
I might be wearin' one of them
uniforms, flippin' some burgers...
saltin' some fries.
You never know. It could be the
best thing that ever happened to me.
Get out of here!
I saw her!
- That wasn't nice.
- What? What did I do?
You know what you did.
That's your mother in there.
- Your mother.
- I know.
I don't get you, man.
I just don't get it.
- Let's go, buddy.
- Okay.
Come on.
Run, now! Run!
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye, you guys.
I'm not tired yet, Gilbert.
Gotta go to sleep, okay?
Okay. Good-bye.
No, it's not good-bye.
It's good night.
Good-bye is for when
you're going away.
And we're not going anywhere,
are we?
I know that.
- Jeez, I know that, Gilbert.
- See you tomorrow.
We're not going anywhere!
Good-bye!
- You gotta work later?
- Yeah, I do.
Hi there, ladies.
- I gotta come back.
- How's Mama?
- She's fat.
- Come on, man.
- She's not all that big.
- What?
I saw a guy at the state fair
who was a little bit bigger.
A little bit bigger?
All I'm saying is she's not
the biggest I've ever seen.
- Tucker, she's a whale!
- Take her out for a walk.
- Take her out for a jog.
- Tucker, she's a whale!
- I'm just sayin' give her a chance.
- Hi, guys.
- How's business?
- Not good.
Nobody's dying.
There's a clear ladder.
There's a clear corporate ladder.
- I mean, this is not...
- That's good.
That's a good thing for you to do.
If you guys would give it a chance...
I just was saying that it wasn't
something I should be doing myself.
They use canola oil, okay?
You know what canola oil is?
You probably don't.
They probably don't sell it
at Lamson's Grocery.
It's cutting edge.
It creates a crispier french fry...
and a more unique product.
And Burger Barn... Forget Wendy's,
Burger King, McDonald's.
That's old hat.
Burger Barn's cutting edge.
I mean,
I could really stand behind it.
It's an innovative place.
They created the salad bar...
which is now mimicked by every
single fast-food chain in America.
They came up with that.
Fifteen different toppings for
each salad, two kinds of lettuce.
And it's all that you care to eat.
You either go from clerk to fry cook
to cook to assistant manager...
of you can go from clerk
to cashier captain...
to assistant manager.
And then from assistant manager,
you could go to manager...
and then regional manager
and then...
Look at the little fellas.
You mean my hoppers.
Let's try this.
For my friend.
There you go, my boy.
What do you say, Arnie?
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
This Thursday.
It's our anniversary.
I'll need a delivery later.
Have a nice day.
He's behind the chips.
- Delivery, son.
- Excuse me?
Delivery. She's gonna be
needin' some help.
Yes, sir.
- Is that your bike?
- Yes.
I'll do it, Gilbert.
- Here. Wait a sec.
- I got it!
- I did it, huh?
- Look there.
I did it by myself.
Yeah. Look at that.
I could go at any time.
Any time.
Excuse me. Where to?
Just keep going straight.
All right.
My mom wants me to become 18.
I'm having a big party, huh?
- When is that party coming?
- Six days.
Six days and my party,
and I'm gonna become 18.
I'm 18, and you're not invited.
- Don't be rude.
- It's okay.
He's just being honest.
I don't mind.
- I got the groceries!
- Be careful with them.
I got the groceries.
I got 'em, okay?
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.
- Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm really sorry.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.
Are you sorry?
I'm not sorry. He's not sorry.
We're not sorry.
Don't be sorry.
I'm not sorry.
If people are gonna come that early,
we should have some appetizers.
That'd be good. You know
those little Vienna sausage things?
You put 'em in grape jelly
and ketchup and make a sauce.
- I want hot dogs, Mom.
- How about pretzels?
You know, like those Hawaiian
appetizers they make with...
You get pineapple chunks
out of the can...
and you wrap them with
little pieces of bacon...
- and put a toothpick through 'em.
- How do you cook the bacon?
In the oven on a pan.
The bacon's not gonna be crisp if
you bake it in the oven on a sheet.
- Yes, it will.
- Nobody wants greasy...
- I want hot dogs!
- ...floppy bacon.
- I want hot dogs!
- We're gonna have hot dogs, honey.
I promise,
we're gonna have hot dogs.
The thing about every party
that I've been to is that... What?
Could you not talk
with your mouth full?
Excuse me?
You're making me sick.
I'm gonna throw up.
Okay, Dad.
- Sure thing, Dad.
- Will you two cut it out?
- Okay, Dad. Sure thing, Dad.
- That's nice.
- Stop it, you guys.
- Dad's dead, Ellen.
- I can't believe you said that.
- Shut up!
Dad's dead!
- Arnie...
- Dad's dead!
Arnie, it's okay.
Stop it now.
- Oh, God.
- Dad's dead! Dad's dead!
- Mama, don't get upset.
- Make him stop.
- Arnie, shut up!
- Dead! Dead! Dead!
- You're crazy, Arnie!
- Stop it.
- Just calm down.
- Stop it!
- Stop it!
- That's enough!
Arnie, that's enough!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
- Arnie, be quiet.
- Dad's dead!
I said, stop it right now!
It should be two-by-tens
or two-by-twelves...
and the space
between 'em here should...
Right now, it's at two feet.
This should be 16 inches.
I mean, that's just standard.
And this right here...
See this here? Flat flooring?
Once the wood gets old,
you're gonna fall right through it.
I guess Daddy wasn't
much of a carpenter.
Gilbert, why did he use
two-by-sixes instead of two-by...
- What?
- Keep it down.
Sorry.
She's coming.
She's coming.
You all right?
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks a lot for coming.
I'll come by tomorrow
with the wood.
Let's keep it quiet.
I forgot to tell you.
- What?
- Burger Barn.
I'm in. I got the call.
- Good.
- It's not too late, you know.
Good night.
I think she's asleep.
Say you wanna slice down zucchini
squash in the food dehydrator.
- Look at this.
- Wonderful!
- Perfect slices every time. Nice?
- Marvelous.
'Course, if you know someone
that can't chew too well...
take the corn off the cob.
Look at this. We'll just
turn down the dial a little...
...freeze corn and sit there
for hours with a knife...
literally hours,
cutting their corn.
- Unbelievable!
- 'Course, for un...
- Right now, you get the...
- What are you doing?
- Give me that.
- Sorry, Mama.
Jeez.
The $30 Dial-O-Matic Food Slicer,
a $ 160 value, right now.
I made up that bed for you.
What for?
Just in case you wanted a change.
I'm happy right where I am.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Here you go.
Here you go, Mama.
Thanks, kids.
- Good night, Mama.
- You're so helpful.
I took her delivery,
we talked a little bit.
And that was it.
I dropped her off.
What's she doing here?
I don't know.
She's just sort of here.
I think their car broke down.
Come on.
I see it in your face.
Can we not talk about this now?
Can we change the subject?
Do you understand?
We want a pool.
- You're tellin' me later.
- I'll tell you everything later.
Look at those guys out there.
They're laughing,
they're all happy...
and waving to their friends.
But the next day... and this is
the thing they don't know...
they could be lying on the slab.
It's kind of harsh.
But it's kind of fun too.
- Do you ever...
- What?
Well, you know.
Are you tempted to, like...
wanna fool around with the bodies?
No, I've always wanted to ask.
I'm sorry if
it makes you uncomfortable.
- People are curious about that.
- If you don't wanna talk about it...
The worst thing that we do is
we take the grotesque bodies...
the really ugly ones...
and we make
harmless jokes about them.
Very harmless jokes,
but we come up with...
some very good jokes about them...
my father and me.
But, you know, they're dead.
- Nobody hears anything.
- Hi, boys.
Hello, Mrs. Carver.
Those jokes don't hurt anybody.
Nobody knows we even make them.
Gilbert, I'm waiting for your call.
Mr. Carver, I haven't seen
your mother in church lately.
- How's she doing?
- She's fine.
Thanks. Bye.
He wants to kill you, right?
Do you prefer a bronze casket?
Can somebody give me
a hand down here?
- What?
- I need a hand with the wood.
You wanna go help Tucker?
Go help Tucker in the basement.
- Go into the basement...
- I don't wanna go down there.
- Please?
- No way! No way! You!
- Go down there, Gilbert.
- Is there a problem?
Dad's in there!
Shut up!
Come on!
It's not funny!
Get back here!
Don't worry.
Those are two-by-sixes.
There's six of'em,
so those could hold anybody.
- I forgot.
- What?
I forgot that
that was where your dad...
I'm sorry.
No, that's okay.
Don't worry about it.
- No, Arnie! No climbing!
- I wanna go up there!
No, you're not!
Not again!
- I wanna go up there!
- Get down. Get down.
Get down!
You're not going anywhere!
Not too much fun, is it?
I wanna go up there!
We're going home.
- Stop!
- Ellen, no!
Stop it!
I told you, don't touch him.
- Don't ever touch him again.
- He was climbing again!
I don't care.
Just get out of here!
Let me see, buddy.
Come on. Let me see.
Oh, great.
You made him bleed!
What does Gilbert say?
If anybody ever hits you...
or even just lays a finger on you,
what are you gonna do?
You're gonna tell me, and then
I'm gonna take care of it for you.
And why will I take care of it?
- Because you're Gilbert.
- Because I'm Gilbert.
Because nobody hurts Arnie,
right?
You wanna pick out some candy?
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What do you want?
We've got to keep
a closer eye on him.
- What?
- We've gotta do better.
Are you listening to me?
Mine.
And you.
You have to stay here.
You stay right on this porch.
You don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.
- Don't go anywhere.
We're not going anywhere.
Where are you going?
I'm waiting.
Waitin' for that call, Gilbert.
- Look. Come here.
- What?
It's a praying mantis.
You know how they mate? The male
will sneak up on the female...
and she'll bite off his head...
and the rest of his body
will keep on mating.
And then when they're done...
she'll eat him.
She'll eat the rest of him.
Grandma, we have company.
So, do you want to eat?
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.
Well, we missed the rally
in Des Moines.
If we get on the road by Friday,
we'll be able...
to make Colorado Springs
in time to catch them.
Have you ever been to Colorado?
No, ma'am.
It must be wonderful.
It must be incredibly
frustrating then...
to be stuck here in this place,
in Endora.
This place
is as good a place as any.
Think so?
She should know.
Becky's been just about
everywhere there is to go.
Places I didn't even know existed.
I'm a worldly kind of girl.
Me, I spent most of my whole life
in the same spot.
Why doesn't matter.
Anyway, she encouraged me
to get out.
Now she can't stay put anywhere.
She's the smartest,
most beautiful girl in the world.
Isn't she beautiful?
I'm sorry. She has this thing
with beauty that...
Yeah, I noticed that.
I'm not into that...
that whole external beauty thing.
- 'Cause it doesn't last.
- Right.
Eventually, your face
is gonna get wrinkly...
you'll get gray hair,
your boobs might sag.
You know? So what?
It's what you do
that really matters.
- Right?
- Yeah, sure.
So what do you wanna do?
I don't know. There's not
so much to do here, really.
You can think of one thing.
Think of one thing people do here.
Thank you.
It was nice meeting you.
Be nice.
Can I have yours
and I'll give you mine instead?
We want the big one!
You know something?
The one on top of it is fine.
We want the big one!
- Let's go.
- Get us the big one!
- Come on, Mom. Please?
- Here you go, guys.
- We want the big one.
- Yeah, that's fine.
It's changing.
That's what's wild about the sunset.
It'll just change really,
really slowly in front of your eyes.
I love the sky.
It's so limitless.
It is big.
It's very big.
Big doesn't even sum it up right.
That word "big" is so small.
You'd have to get
those really giant words...
to describe the sky.
What?
I have to go do this thing.
It's kind of a family thing.
Do you want me to give you a ride
back into town, or do you wanna...
No, actually,
I'm just gonna sit here.
I could come back.
I mean, I can come back and...
- Really?
- Yeah. You'll be here then?
Yeah. I'll just sit here.
All right, I'll be back
in a little bit.
Hey, buddy. Come on.
We gotta go.
Where's the duck?
I can't see the duck anywhere.
- Find him. Look. Where'd he go?
- Where's the duck?
- It's hiding. Find the duck.
- I don't have time for this.
Lift up. Okay, good.
- Ducky.
- Good boy. You know what?
- You're such a big boy.
- Yeah.
- You're such a big boy.
- I'm a big boy.
I bet you could do this all
by yourself if you really wanted to.
- Could you do this by yourself?
- I'm a big boy.
- Yeah, be a big boy.
- Big boy.
Take this, wash everything.
Your towels are there,
and your robe is there.
- The big boy's gonna wash himself.
- Right.
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
- You missed it.
- What did I miss?
- The sunset.
- Really?
It was beautiful.
Oh, well.
I'd like to see where you live.
No, you wouldn't.
Let's go see where you live.
Come on.
My parents split up
when I was a kid.
I go back and forth between them...
'cause they're always moving.
But it's good.
It's my life.
We don't really move.
I mean, we'd like to, but...
my mom is sort of
attached to the house.
Attached is, I guess,
not the right word.
She's pretty much wedged in.
- What do you mean?
- That's it.
That's the house.
It's really amazing.
I mean, how small it looks
from here, considering the...
the girth of what's inside of it.
I don't know.
Did you ever see
a beached whale on television?
That's her.
That's my mom.
What about your dad?
Some other day.
Some other day.
I had a nice time tonight.
I know.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come on.
I'm sorry. Come on.
Here. You're okay.
Come on. Get warm.
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, buddy.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
- Would somebody please explain?
- Gilbert's in charge of bathing.
I could have "drownded."
- No more baths.
- But you didn't, honey.
- You could've, but you didn't.
- No more baths.
It is too much to ask
to see this boy turn 18?
It's ready.
Where's your head lately?
Where is your head?
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry isn't good enough.
You gotta do better.
Gotta do better.
Hey, boss, is that the right price?
That's right.
- It seems like it ought to be more.
- Maybe at Foodland.
We've always had
a reasonable deal on pickles.
Here.
Gilbert, got a delivery
for you, son.
It sounds urgent.
Get out.
Go outside and play, right now.
Right now. Hurry up.
- Hi, Betty.
- Hi.
Could you dial that number
over there for me?
- My hands are all...
- Yeah, sure.
- How have you been?
- Good.
I saw you last night.
Who's the girl?
- It's ringing.
- Sorry. One sec.
This is good. Taste.
That's good. It's ringing.
One second.
Hello? Ken Carver here,
Carver Insurance.
- Mr. Carver?
- Who is this?
It's Gilbert.
I'd given up on you, Gilbert.
- Did you?
- Well, yeah. Can you blame me?
I mean, how many times do I have
to ask, and still no visit?
- Well, I'm here now.
- Happy anniversary.
Well, we can't discuss this
over the phone. I think it's best...
that we meet man to man,
don't you agree?
- Yes.
- Today is your lucky day.
I've just had a cancellation.
What about right now? Are you free?
Is that a yes?
- Okay.
- All right.
I'm gonna be waiting here for you.
Do you want me to be killed?
Do you want him to kill me?
Just playing.
Don't you wanna play?
This is crazy.
- I've gotta go.
- You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.
It's that new girl, isn't it?
It's your husband. He wants me
to come to his office right now.
If you walk out that door...
Don't you dare walk out that door.
You look nervous, Gilbert.
I'd be nervous too if I were you.
If I were in your situation,
I'd be downright panicky.
I reviewed your file.
You've got
no major medical insurance.
No catastrophic, no life.
What if something
were to happen to you?
Something unforeseeable?
Something sudden? Random?
An accident, maybe.
What about your family?
Do you ever think about your family?
Stop thinking about yourself.
Think about them.
You don't wanna leave 'em
empty-handed.
Ken Carver here.
Can't this wait?
I'm in the middle...
Please, calm down.
Calm down.
Go on.
Calm... I'm on my way.
Troubles at home.
I'm sure you understand.
Damn. Betty's got the car.
Would you give me a ride?
Oh, my God! Betty!
What the hell's going on here?
Todd? Doug?
What is going on here?
I don't believe this!
Oh, great!
Boys, come on.
Let's go show your mom the cookies
that she's baked for us.
This is great.
All right.
Everything's okay.
Look, honey, they're fine.
They taste fine.
They're a little burnt on top,
but just fine.
They're wonderful.
Boys, here.
Have some of Mom's cookies.
They're really good.
Come on, boys.
Make your mother happy.
Make your mom happy.
Have some cookies.
I could've had any guy.
Any guy!
But...
I chose you.
I got you a real pool,
for God's sake!
Look! There's water in here!
Come here!
Get over here!
Get inside the pool!
Get inside the pool
with your brother!
Why did you?
Yeah. Look.
Real water, boys.
Because...
I knew you'd always be there.
Because I knew you'd never leave.
What the hell else
more do you want?
What? For God's sake!
Son, get back in the pool.
Get back in the pool!
We're all gonna enjoy it!
It's a lot of fun, isn't it?
I'm doin' the best I can here.
I can't do any better!
I can't give anymore.
I've given enough already.
I guess maybe
I'd better be getting off.
Not yet.
Arthur, in all my life...
I'll wonder, where is he?
Just this moment, just now...
what is he looking at?
What is he thinking?
I think it's time for Arnie
to take a bath.
Don't you think it's time
for Arnie to take a bath, Gilbert?
Just let him stink.
- I don't wanna take a bath!
- Please.
You know Mr. Carver?
Well, he's dead.
- What's going on?
- He drowned.
- You're kidding?
- No. In that.
A kiddie pool.
I don't get it.
It's like one foot deep.
Weird, right?
- Yeah.
- He "drownded."
He had the cardiac arrest.
His head bent forward...
his knees buckled...
and then he just fell...
face forward into the pool.
When she found him,
he was already dead.
That's what we don't know.
That's what nobody knows.
No, I know it.
I saw the body.
I prepared it.
I know exactly what...
I would have seen if there was
any kind of struggle.
- It was murder.
- No.
What do you think?
What do you think?
I don't know.
It's possible.
Bob, we're talking about
thousands and thousands of dollars.
- If she saw...
- She doesn't have to work...
She doesn't have to work
for the rest of her life.
If you saw somebody laying...
with their head down
in the pool motionless...
or even if they were kind of
limply doing that...
- which he wasn't doing...
- You don't know that!
Well, it was an extreme
"post-cardial" infarction.
- Extreme.
- So nothing's fishy?
Gilbert, look!
It's that girl!
It's that girl!
Wait a minute.
We're not talkin' about
takin' a gun and shootin' somebody.
We're talkin' about pushin' along
something rolling in that direction.
Please, play with me over there.
Come on.
Let's play over there.
- How are you doin'?
- Fine.
- Will you play?
- Okay, we'll play.
- Settle down.
- We're gonna play!
- Will you give us a ride?
- Yeah.
So, that's it.
Yeah, I guess so.
The magic part.
The magic part?
- Could we go...
- Grandma, here it is.
- Thanks.
- Can we go play now?
What are we gonna play?
Can we play hide-and-go-seek?
- Would you give me some help?
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Hang on one second.
- Okay.
Try it.
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't...
It's a mystery.
- Listen, thanks anyway.
- No problem.
Come play with me in the water.
You can't find me.
You can't find me anywhere.
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.
No, I want you to come in with me.
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say "Where's Arnie?"
Say that.
Where's Arnie?
You can't find me.
Say it again. Hi!
Say it again,
and you gotta look for me around.
I wanted you
to swim with me, Arnie.
Don't even try it, 'cause he's
had a scare with water...
and he won't come in.
I'm not comin' in the water.
You wanna come in the water?
Why not?
Are you scared
to come in the water?
- No, no.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- He's scared.
Are you scared, Gilbert?
All right, what do you want to see?
Do you want to see...
Do you want to see me get wet
a little, like this?
- Yeah.
- A little splash?
A little more.
Do you wanna see this?
You want this, right?
Huh? You happy?
Tell me what you want
as fast as it comes to you.
Okay, what do you want?
- Faster!
- Okay.
I want a new thing.
House. I want a new house
for the family.
I want Mama...
to take aerobics classes.
I want Ellen to grow up.
I want a new brain for Arnie.
I want...
What do you want for you?
Just for you.
I want to be a good person.
I can't do this.
- Okay.
- Where's Arnie?
Excuse me, ma'am,
have you seen my brother?
Shit.
Come on.
- I did it again!
- Get this unbuckled.
All right, here we go.
There you go.
It's all right, Jerry.
I got him. I got him.
We're takin' him in.
It's not gonna happen again,
I promise.
We've warned you,
we've warned your sister...
that the next time
was gonna be the last time.
- Great. Great.
- Flash the lights! Play the siren!
- I don't believe this.
- Play the siren for me!
Way to go, Gilbert.
Jerry, listen. You're gonna
have to take it easy on him.
- We'll take care of him.
- You gotta keep an eye on him.
All right.
Do the siren, okay?
Do the siren, all right?
I know, Sheriff.
I know that, Sheriff.
Okay. Asshole!
They're probably just teaching him
a lesson, proving a point.
Yeah. That's right.
Get my coat.
What?
Get my coat.
Get it!
Let's go.
Well, at least
he's in a safe place.
- At least someone's watching him.
- Ellen, shut up.
You guys wait here.
I'll be right back, okay?
Mama, let Gilbert handle this.
- Come on, please.
- Please, have a seat outside.
- You gotta let him out.
- You need to wait your turn, okay?
I don't think you guys understand.
It's gonna be...
Look, no one's gonna do a thing
until you go and sit down outside...
I've come for my son.
Sheriff?
Sheriff, are you there?
Bonnie, you'll need
to fill out some papers.
- Police procedure requires...
- I want my boy, Jerry.
My son! Give me my son!
Come on. You're goin' home.
Sunshine, you're free!
Oh, baby.
Don't disappear like that anymore.
Promise me.
You're free, baby.
Let's go home.
Look!
That's why she needs a cane.
Look at her!
Mama, they didn't
flash the lights for me either.
Flash the lights.
Look at me!
I'm hiding!
Say "Where's Arnie?"
- Say like that.
- Arnie, get down.
Gilbert, come find me.
Where's Arnie?
That's my mom in there.
My mama.
Gilbert,
come play with me up here.
Come play with me.
God, that was so brave,
what your mother did.
You know that, right?
I'd like to meet her.
No, you wouldn't.
Okay, where do you go next?
I would like to meet your mom.
In sure and certain hope of
the resurrection to eternal life...
we commend to Almighty God
our brother, Kenneth Carver...
and we commit his body
to the ground.
Earth to earth...
ashes to ashes and dust to dust.
The Lord bless him and keep him.
The Lord make His face
shine on him...
and be gracious to him.
The Lord look upon him
with favor...
and give him peace.
Lord Jesus, by Your death
You took away the sting of death.
Grant to us, Your servants,
so to follow in faith...
for You have led the way...
that we may at length
fall asleep peacefully in You...
- Look here!
- ...great in Your likeness...
the God of peace who brought again
from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ.
The great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the covenant...
It's a Burger Barn, Gilbert!
...make you perfect in
every good work to do His will...
...working in you that which is
well pleasing in His sight...
- Burger Barn!
- ...through Jesus Christ, amen.
Boys, you can have
anything you want.
You could get candy if you want.
You can have candy if you want.
As for me,
something with menthol, please.
You like gum?
I like gum.
Here's a good kind.
Here, take this.
You can have it.
- You want gum too?
- We're going to St. Louis.
I can't stay in that house.
I really am sorry about your...
Here, Mommy will take care of it.
You run on outside.
Everybody thinks I killed him.
Do you?
I miss him...
and I don't.
I miss him, and I don't.
So, Gilbert,
what's to become of you?
Oh, I'll probably just...
You haven't thought about it.
Poor Gilbert... cooped up...
taking care of everybody else,
forgettin' all about you.
- Mommy?
- Coming in a minute, honey.
Concerning my boys?
I was thinkin' that if my boys
turn out anything like you...
I was thinkin'
how that would be nice...
for my boys to be like you.
He's all yours.
Are you gonna miss her?
Yeah.
Good.
Damn it!
So...
what do you think?
- Wow.
- Right?
Right?
Here, try a milkshake.
Real milk in there.
- You're kidding.
- Real milk.
Congratulations!
This looks great!
- Yeah, thanks a million.
- What?
You tryin' to depress everybody?
You're gonna ruin their appetites.
Mike, right? You wanna come
to my party tomorrow?
I'm gonna be 18 years old.
Wanna come?
You can come too, if you want to.
I don't know you, but you can come.
How nice to see so many of you here
on this great day.
This day marks the beginning
of a new era for Endora...
for the Burger Barn family and,
I hope, for all of you.
We at Burger Barn are committed...
to a very special relationship with
you, one that will last and last.
In a time when so many things
are falling apart...
Endora decides to give
Burger Barn a chance...
a new breath of life.
She fixed it.
The camper's fixed...
and we're gonna
be leaving tomorrow.
Come on!
Hey, you can come to my party
tomorrow, okay? You can come.
So, I'm invited.
Do you not want me to go?
I mean, go if you want.
Oh, so is this how you want it?
I have to go.
Take care, okay?
Good-bye, Arnie.
- Come on, let's get that bath.
- No. No!
Guys!
You gotta take a bath, Arnie.
Arnie, you gotta do it.
It's your birthday.
- Arnie, damn it!
- Oh, no!
Oh, God.
I can't make another one.
I can't.
We have to have a cake, Gilbert.
Attention, Foodland shoppers.
Remember every day this week
is a double coupon day.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
My sister called in
an order for Grape.
Oh, yeah. It's all set.
There you go.
That'll be 19.75.
- Go away, Arnie.
- Gilbert, what's in there?
- It's a surprise. Leave it alone.
- What's in that box?
Don't touch it.
If you touch it, I'll kill you.
I can't believe you.
Look, I'll enjoy the party
from in here. It'll be fine.
You'll see.
Everything'll be just fine.
What am I
supposed to say to people?
It's Arnie's 18th birthday. You've
waited to do this for a long time.
Wasn't it you who wanted to have
this huge party in the first place?
I didn't want to.
- Damn it!
- I can't believe you!
- Arnie!
- Oh, man.
- Look, he's eating the cake!
- Shit!
- That's it. Forget it.
- Nice job, Arnie.
Now what are we gonna do?
Come here. Come here!
Do you know what that fucking cost?
Do you know what I had to do?
Come on.
No, no, it's time for your bath.
Get your clothes off.
Get 'em off!
Get in that bath.
Get them fucking clothes off.
Come on.
Don't move. Don't move!
Gilbert, stop!
What did you do?
What is goin' on?
Don't worry, Mama.
Ellen, let's go.
- We should call his mother.
- No, no. It's okay.
I know where he lives.
I can take him.
It's really okay. Yeah.
Arnie, you wanna go for a walk?
You wanna go play, Arnie?
Come on, Arnie.
- Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
- Come on, Arnie. You can do it.
Come on, Arnie.
You can do it. Come on.
- "Merrily, merrily." Sing that.
- Okay.
Row, row, row your boat.
Gently down the stream.
You did it!
Good job, Arnie!
You did it!
So I'll see you
in a little bit, okay?
- Bye!
- Bye, Arnie.
Take care.
I "drownded," huh?
I "drownded" over there.
No, you just got clean.
So he's clean now, you guys.
- No, I'm fine.
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- All right.
- Bye!
- Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
I hit him.
I hit him so hard, I...
He's gonna be okay.
You don't hurt Arnie.
You just don't.
I gotta go. I gotta go.
I got nowhere to go.
I had to work extra hours
just to feed her.
So it's your fault?
You don't understand. She was
in shock for years. He disappeared.
He didn't say good-bye.
He just...
One day, all of a sudden...
he was gone.
He was just hangin' there.
That's when it all started.
She used to be so pretty.
She was so pretty and so fun.
So you think it's his fault?
Nobody knew what he felt.
He didn't give anything.
He was just sort of there.
You'd try to play with him,
you know, get him to play around...
or get him to laugh
or get him to smile or get him to...
I don't know... get mad.
But nothin'.
Just like he was already dead.
I used to know a guy like that.
It's Arnie's birthday.
I need to go home.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Give my regards to your mother.
- Hey, Amy, look who's here.
- Where you been?
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
He's alive.
Where's Arnie?
Please, Amy.
Is he okay?
I think you better
ask him that yourself.
Where is he?
I wonder where he could be.
Have you seen Arnie?
No, I thought he was with you.
Anybody seen Arnie?
Where's my brother?
Come here.
You scared me, buddy.
You scared Gilbert.
Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Don't scare Gilbert, okay?
- Okay.
Come here.
Who's got you?
You better talk to Mama.
What you did was...
He's a helpless boy, Gilbert.
And then disappearing like that?
I hate that.
You know how I hate that.
You walked out, and I thought...
I can't take another.
But you came back, Gilbert.
Why?
Why did you?
I don't know, Mama.
I'm here now.
Yes, you are.
You came back for the party.
I can't imagine
how it's been for you kids.
I know what a burden I am.
Don't say that.
I know it.
And I know that
you're ashamed of me.
No, I'm not.
I never, never meant
to be like this.
I never wanted to be a joke.
You're no joke, Mama.
- I never wanted to be.
- You're no joke.
Please don't disappear.
Please don't disappear.
Hurry! Hurry!
You're really growing up to be
quite a young lady.
- Thanks.
- Hey. Hi.
You know, I don't want to
rain on the day here...
but you have a serious
foundation problem.
You see how the porch is
slanted right here?
I mean, this is a serious problem.
We need to get up underneath here...
First of all, we need to fill this
in so no more water collects here.
And then we'll probably...
What?
- Hello, Gilbert.
- Nana.
- You ready?
- For what?
I want you to come meet somebody.
- Here's your present.
- Arnie, what do you say?
Thank you!
Mama, I want you
to meet somebody.
Please?
Just this once, for me?
Gilbert, it's okay.
We can do it later.
No. This is what I want.
Do it for me, please?
This is different.
Nobody's gonna laugh.
I'm not gonna
hurt you anymore, Mama.
I promise.
Please.
Mama, this is Becky.
I haven't always been like this.
I haven't always been like this.
- I'm called a miracle.
- You're a miracle?
- I'm a miracle.
- A walking miracle.
I can believe that.
I'm just gonna put this up here.
- Bye.
- Good-bye, Arnie. You take care.
I had a really nice time.
I know.
- I don't know what to say.
- Say "Thank you," Gilbert.
Say "Thank you."
Thank you.
- Good-bye.
- No, it's not good-bye, Arnie.
It's good night.
Good night to you, but not me.
Hey, they're coming!
Bye! Wait!
Mama, what are you doing?
You rest, Mama.
You deserve to rest.
Get me my birthday boy.
I want my birthday boy.
Here, Mama.
Here's the water.
You're my knight
in shimmering armor.
Did you know that?
I think you mean "shining."
No, "shimmering."
You shimmer and you glow.
You rest, okay?
Get some sleep.
Wake up!
You're hiding, huh?
I know that.
Wake up!
Mama, wake up!
Mama, stop it now!
Stop, Mama!
Stop it.
What's wrong?
What's wrong? Stop it!
I'm gonna need
some more men, Amy.
Hey, flash the lights.
Flash 'em.
You may need the National Guard
to move her outta there.
I'm sorry about that.
It's gonna take a crane
to get her out.
There's gonna be a crowd.
I just know
there's gonna be a crowd.
She's so beautiful.
She's no joke.
I'm not gonna let her be a joke.
We're gonna need your help.
Gilbert, is that them?
- No, not yet.
- When are they gonna come?
Pretty soon.
My brother Arnie's
about to turn 19.
Gilbert, look there!
Amy got a job offer
to manage a bakery in Des Moines.
- Is that them?
- Yeah, that's them.
Ellen can't wait
to switch schools.
Arnie asked if we were gonna
go too, and I said...
"Well, we can go anywhere..."
if we want.
- "We can go anywhere."
- Becky's comin', huh, Gilbert?
Yep. She's comin'.
Come on! Come on, Gilbert.
- How are you?
- I'm fine. How are you?
