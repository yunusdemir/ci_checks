ON THE NIGHT
PAPA TOOK HIS FINAL BREATH,</i>
<i>EVERYTHING BECAME QUIET.</i>
<i>FOR A MOMENT,
EVEN THE WIND STOPPED BLOWING.</i>
<i>AT HIS FUNERAL, I REMEMBER
I WISH I COULD LEAVE BEHIND...</i>
<i>THE GHOST OF MY PAST,</i>
<i>AND START ALL OVER AGAIN.</i>
<i>THAT NIGHT,
MY WISH COME TRUE.</i>
<i>MY AUNT SODE TOLD ME
SHE HAD VISITED THE MATCHMAKER.</i>

ABOUT MY PARENTS?
YOU MEAN HOW THEY DIED?

<i>MATSUJI IS SUCH A HANDSOME MAN.</i>
<i>HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

"WHEN THE MIST COVERS

IN ANTICIPATION

I'M INSPIRED
TO WRITE THIS HAIKU POEM.

I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU

AT LEAST IN HAWAII NO ONE WILL
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR PAST.
BUT HAWAII...IT'S SO FAR AWAY.
THAT'S WHY IT'S PERFECT.

LEAVE YOUR PAST BEHIND...
AND START ALL OVER AGAIN.
RIYO, MAYBE YOUR LUCK
IS CHANGING.
NOW LOOK AT ME...

YOUR HUSBAND-TO-BE.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S WRONG?
SIT DOWN.
WE MIGHT GO ON STRIKE...
SO WE'RE STARTING
TO COLLECT A FUND.
BUT...SO MUCH?
EVERYONE HAS TO GIVE
AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.
LET'S SEE HOW MUCH
YOU'VE SAVED UP.
ONLY TWO DOLLARS?
EVERYONE ELSE IS
CONTRIBUTING MORE.
YOU HAVE TO GIVE MORE.
A STRIKE WON'T DO ANY GOOD!
WE'LL ONLY LOSE OUR HOMES
AND OUR JOBS...EVERYTHING.
<i>BUT WE HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE.</i>
COME ON, GIVE IT TO ME.
I WON'T LET YOU USE MY MONEY
AS YOU WISH!
I WORKED SO HARD TO SAVE THIS.
<i>I KNOW!
I TOLD YOU I UNDERSTAND!</i>
BUT HOW ELSE WILL THINGS CHANGE?
NO!
YOU ARE SO STUBBORN!

WHAT ARE YOU HIDING FROM ME?
RIYO, TELL ME!
[ Thunderclaps ]
ARE YOU SAVING YOUR MONEY
TO RUN OFF WITH YOUR LOVER?
I WAS ONLY FIVE WHEN WE
LEFT KAGOSHIMA VILLAGE.
IT WAS THE YEAR WHEN
SAKURAJIMA VOLCANO ERUPTED.
ASHES FELL FROM THE SKY
LIKE SNOW.
MY PARENTS GOT VERY SICK FROM
WORKING IN THE FACTORY
IN YOKOHAMA.
MY MOTHER DIED FIRST.
I...
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
IT WAS SO PAINFUL...
I WAS SO ASHAMED.
THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARENTS DIDN'T
ALLOW THEIR CHILDREN NEAR ME.
WHY WERE YOU ASHAMED?
THEY BOTH DIED
OF...TUBERCULOSIS.
I'M SORRY.
TUBERCULOSIS?
BUT I'M NOT SICK.
TUBERCULOSIS!
BUT MY PARENTS DIDN'T TELL ME...
IF THEY HAD KNOWN...
THEY'D NEVER HAVE
APPROVED OUR MATCH.
MY AUNT LIED.
IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE.
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
IF I RETURNED HOME?
GO TO SLEEP.
