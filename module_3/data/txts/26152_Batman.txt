I should never have
allied myself with a madman.
Where are they?
In Sarajevo, sir.
And he has the boy.
Wow, that looked like it really hurt.
Whoa, now, hang on.
That looked like it hurt a lot more.
So let's try and clear
this up, okay, pumpkin?
What hurts more? A?
Or B?
Forehand?
Or backhand?
A little louder, lamb chop.
I think you may have a collapsed lung.
That always impedes the oratory.
Now, that was rude.
The first boy blunder had some manners.
I suppose I'm going to have
to teach you a lesson...
so you can better follow
in his footsteps.
No, I'm just gonna keep beating
you with this crowbar.
Where is the detective?
He's on his way.
But, sir, he won't
make it there in time.
Okay, kiddo, I gotta go.
It's been fun though, right?
Well, maybe a smidge more
fun for me than you.
I'm just guessing since
you're being awful quiet.
Anyway, be a good boy. Finish
your homework and be in bed by 9.
And, hey...
please tell the big
man I said, "Hello."
No.
Jason.
The hell you say.
You didn't set this up?
Then whose party is this?
I thought it was you
east-side losers.
You already rolled over
for the Black Mask
and I figured you
were gonna ask us in.
Rolled over? The Mask whacked
six of my crew in a month. Six.
Some of my best people.
So you set up this meet?
No, I thought it was Chi Chi.
Wasn't my meet.
Oh, the hell with this. I'm gone.
You brain donors wanna hang around...
Sit down, Freddie.
It's my meeting.
- It's him.
- Batman?
We didn't do nothing.
Well, we all know that's a lie.
- Who the hell are you?
- Smoke him.
I said, "Sit down."
You wanna die?
There's easier ways to kill yourself.
Yeah, like yelling at the guy
who's hoiding the AK-47.
Listen to me,
you drug-peddling scumbags.
I will be running the
drug trade from now on.
You eight are the most prosperous
street dealers in Gotham.
I'm offering you morons a deal.
You go about your business as usual,
but kick up 40 percent to me.
A much sweeter deal than the
scraps Black Mask is leaving you.
In return, you will
have total protection
from both Black Mask and Batman.
But you stay away from
kids and school yards.
No dealing to children, got it?
If you do, you're dead.
Okay, crazy man, this
is all very generous.
But why in the hell
should we listen to you?
Damn.
Those are the heads
of all of your lieutenants.
That took me two hours.
You wanna see what I can get
done in a whole evening?
Make no mistake.
I'm not asking you to kick in with me.
I'm telling you.
Forty percent works for me.
- Go, go, go!
- Where's Raymond and Denny?
- He got them. Just grabbed them up.
- Screw it.
Just go, get us out of here.
I think I lost him.
- You think I lost him?
- I think you lost him.
I think we're good.
No, you're anything but good.
Who are you working for?
Nobody.
Look, we just boosted the truck and...
Lie to me again
and crashing into a wall head-on...
will be the least painful activity
of your evening.
No, I swear to...
- What is that?
- Your cargo.
It's called Amazo.
What the hell is an Amazo?
A highly advanced,
cybernetic android...
equipped with the ability
to absorb the power of super humans.
What kind of super humans?
Big ones.
Packs quite the punch
for a toaster on steroids, huh?
- Need a hand?
- No.
Okay, well, how about
I just stick around and watch?
Who's that other one?
The pretty boy in the leotard?
That's Nightwing.
He was the Bat's first sidekick.
The first Robin.
I think you'll have
to do better than that.
I did.
- Will that do any good?
- It'll slow it down.
You think so?
Get to higher ground.
- Did you know he could fly?
- Move!
I wouldn't be offended
by a few suggestions.
He has the same weak
points as a human being.
Got it. This might sting a bit.
Lasers. He's got lasers.
I don't think putty in his
eyes is gonna hurt him.
But plastique will. Nice.
This shipment was meant
for the Black Mask.
I doubt you're behind this.
Who do you work for?
I swear. We're not
working for anybody.
This was our gig, all our idea.
- Let it go.
- Right.
I'll talk, I'll talk. Just stop.
Just stop!
The Red Hood.
We're working for the Red Hood.
We don't have any choice. He's got...
The shots came from the rooftop.
A sniper.
A good one.
- See him?
- Yeah.
Hey, wait.
Right. Leave me with them.
God, please, no. Stay away.
It's a setup. Wait.
I'm not a crook, I swear.
No!
Hard to forget that night, huh?
In a way, Batman, this was the
site of your first great failure.
Maybe your greatest, but
certainiy not your last, right?
Ah, memories.
This bit of intel
is what brought me to town.
Good thing I've always
had perfect timing.
Take a look.
I got this shot from a snitch.
He says that
this guy's been making
some serious moves.
The Red Hood.
Might be.
He bears a resemblance to the original.
Severai criminals
have utilized this persona.
One criminal of
particuiar interest, though.
- But he's locked up.
- Not his m.o. either.
There's been an uptick in heavy
trafficking, but crime is down.
Indeed it is.
Master Bruce got almost three
hours sleep in the last two days.
True busman's holiday.
But he is locked up.
Like, a lot locked up.
Maybe we should go for a visit.
Could you just once say, "Let's
get in the car"? Is that so hard?
You look good. Been working out?
You could probably use a little sun.
Then again, who am I to talk?
He's calling himself the Red Hood.
What do you know about it?
That he has horrible taste.
When I wore that number, it was classy.
More flashy maitre d'
than motorcycle fetish.
Oh, these kids today.
If you're behind this in
any way, we will find out.
You're not...
Oh, Bird Boy, you're
so much less fun now.
All grown up and in your big-boy pants.
Still, better off than
his replacement, right?
Even tougher making with the yuks
when you're worm food, huh?
You gonna do it this time?
Or you just gonna put me
in another body cast for six months?
So disappointing.
But back to the matter at hand...
this new hoody.
You really think I would
stir up so much trouble...
and not make sure
you knew it was me?
I know you've never met
him before, but be cool.
This here is the Black Mask.
The first boss to gain control
of the entire city in 20 years.
Whatever he wants in Gotham, he gets.
But his appearance takes
a bit to warm up to.
He did what? What?
Oh, good, he's pissed.
Our concern is the one
who ordered the theft of the android.
He goes by the name of Red Hood.
I don't care what he's calling himself.
Do you idiots know how many
bidders I had on Amazo?
A list of puppet dictators and
psychos as long as my arm.
Millions shot right to hell.
- And whose money is that?
- Your money.
My money. Mine.
This score was a game changer.
Amazo was going buy my way up into
high-end internationai trafficking.
Now I'm forced to keep rooting around
in this local leg-breaking garbage.
And he gives me bat troubie,
who blows the damn robot's head off!
I could have at least sold it
for scrap, but Batman kept it.
Yes, Batman likes to keep things.
Look, this circus
act, this Red Foot...
Red Hood.
Whatever.
He's dead. Take care of him.
You, new guy.
- Sir:
BLACK MASK: Don't be nervous, kid.
But if you keep staring at me like
that, I'm gonna cut your eyes out.
Give me the specs on
tonight's shipment.
Yes, sir.
It's 10 cases of assorted
SMGs and PDws...
along with 5000 .45 caliber ACP
rounds, your personal favorite...
and two cases of RPGs.
It's all bought and paid for, so this
is strictly a delivery, not a buy.
In view of recent events, I've taken
the liberty of doubling security...
and switching the drop spot.
That sounds like a plan.
What are they
waiting around for?
Seriously.
Hey, protocol says I'm only supposed
to be on the ground for six minutes.
It's okay. I won't
be staying that long.
And I almost thought he wouldn't show.
You know what I missed most
about running with you? The toys.
Stay sharp. We're not done.
You wanna dance? Let's dance.
- Is that gonna hoid?
- No.
So you want me to...? Should I...?
Okay, I'll just take care of this.
Okay then. Nice night for a run.
- He's good.
- Yes, he's putting on quite a show.
He's very good.
We got him.
- That's impressive.
- Nothing we haven't seen before.
If you say so.
Think we lost him?
Move!
You haven't lost your touch...
He's got some moves, huh? And as
much I hate to belabor a point...
And still that is often
exactly what you do.
I'm chatty. It's part of my charm.
I'm saying that our boy
here has some skills.
He's been trained and trained well.
Like right there. That.
He sliced that cable off his
ankle before it went taut.
You don't just do that.
That has to be practiced. Learned.
- And then there's the knife.
- What about it?
You know many knives
that can cut my lines?
- Not many.
- No. Not many.
Well, look, we obviousiy have got
ourselves a player, we... ow!
Alfred, take him home.
Bruce, I can still help.
You already have.
Thank you.
Go rest up.
Okay.
But you know where to
find me if you need me.
He did just thank me, right?
- Indeed he did, sir.
- Weird.
You haven't lost your touch...
You haven't lost your touch...
your touch, Bru...
You haven't lost your touch, Bruce.
Whoo-hoo!
You guys having a party?
- I guess our invite got lost.
- It's over, Riddler.
Riddle me this. What's green and purple
but covered in red and yellow?
You. When I land on your sorry butt.
Don't move or I'll...
You'll what? Shoot me?
Twenty rounds a second and
you were still too slow.
I'm not slow, punk.
- Me neither.
- I've got him.
Robin!
I had to take him down.
You shattered his collar bone.
He's a drug-deallng pimp.
I didn't think I had to prop up
some pillows before I took him out.
We needed him. He would've talked.
But you put him into shock.
Sorry.
That was dumb.
But he deserved it.
Maybe my last request
was too mired in subtlety.
I want this man dead.
When I say "dead," I
mean seriously dead.
Beaten, broken.
His-head-mounted-on-my-wall
kind of dead!
Understood.
We'll be taking further precautions
at every transaction...
Screw that. Time he learns
that this is a contact sport.
We're going on offense.
Rough up his business.
Something big. Something loud.
When he shows up to shut us down,
have a party waiting for him.
And when I say "party"...
I actually mean a whole lot of
people who are gonna kill him!
- I figured.
- Just being clear.
What are you doing? We're protected.
We pay up to the Red Hood.
Is that right?
Cute.
Do you know who you're messing with?
Yeah, Tyler Bramford.
You're a club owner and some big damned
drug dealer in the East Quarter, right?
I am the East Quarter drug trade,
you stupid bags of...
Manners, fatty.
I don't care who takes care of you.
You watch your mouth.
Then you know who's got my back.
You know who I answer to.
Sure: The Red Hood.
And we work for the man who's
gonna take back what's his.
So at the expense
of your very wide butt...
we're sending your boss a message.
Okay.
What's the message?
A simple one, actually.
Want to guess what it might be?
I have a few ideas.
Any of you hired guns
even know who I am?
You are our target.
Ow.
So you four have all this power and
all you do with it is kill for money?
From what I hear,
we've got that in common.
You heard wrong.
I thought you'd put up more of a fight.
Oh, the fight hasn't started yet.
I'm just stalling.
- What the hell took you so long?
- Shut up and fight.
I gotta say.
I missed watching you work.
Look out!
Awful close.
You afraid you'll miss?
Black Mask just wants a body.
- We don't need your head.
- Let him go.
And step away.
A Taser?
Nail me and you'll
electrocute both of us.
Maybe that's what he has in mind.
No!
Just be happy I
only killed one of them.
They're all assassins.
And what are you?
I'm cleaning up Gotham.
More than you ever did.
You're stealing territory
from Black Mask
and killing anyone who
gets in your way.
Black Mask is just a part of the plan.
Plan? You're becoming a crime lord.
Yes. You can't stop crime.
That's what you never understood.
I'm controlling it.
You wanna rule them by fear.
But what do
you do with the ones
who aren't afraid?
I'm doing what you won't,
I'm taking them out.
Tell me what happened to you.
Let me help.
It's too late.
You had your chance.
And I'm just getting started.
Son of a... Are you telling
me that scumbag stole my guns again?
No, sir. He destroyed them.
Blew up the truck, the drivers...
Damn it. Of all the... Damn it!
Previousiy, he was
just enlisting anyone
under our province to
come work for him.
Now he just seems to be killing them.
Oh, so now we've got another Batman?
One who doesn't mind the blood?
No, sir, he's no Batman.
He's still taking huge
cuts from off the streets.
But now he's eluminating
the competition.
He's coming after you.
You wanna tell me why
this guy ain't dead?
We're trying.
We sent the Fearsome Hand of Four.
Four? Guess they're gonna need
a new name.
Why hasn't Batman wiped this little
smear off the face of the planet?
Maybe he doesn't want to.
Perhaps he's letting you and
the Red Hood war it out.
- He could be waiting...
- To take on the winner?
What do you think this is?
A tennis tournament?
- I'm just saying...
- You're an idiot.
And you don't know Batman.
He's not letting this
lunatic just run wild.
He can't catch him either.
Or it's something else.
Can't you feel it?
We're stuck in the damn crossfire.
Oh, hell.
Sir?
Wow, he sure can move
when he really wants to.
- You okay, sir?
- I'm not dead.
So that's something.
Okay.
- Time to change up the ground war.
- How so, sir?
I'm being forced into
negotiating with a psychotic.
That doesn't sound good.
No.
It's going to be a nightmare.
Hey, fellas, 10 minutes
to bed check, right?
Terry? What the hell
are you doing here?
You miss me?
I'm covering Rothman's shift. He's got
the flu, bronchitis or something.
We got this. Why don't
you grab some joe?
We'll meet you in
the south wing.
That's not protocol.
Come on, I'm bored,
I need to stretch my legs. Let's get...
Sorry, schedule to keep.
You didn't have to kill him.
One, yes, I did.
Two, we're paying you a ton.
So, three, shut your gob
and open the damn door.
- Does he know what's going on?
- He knows he's leaving.
It's gonna be a sleepover, right?
I packed my toothbrush.
- Do you need more light, sir?
- No. I can see fine.
Well, there you have it.
He's still at rest.
No, he isn't.
That's not flesh.
Master Bruce, you
can't blame yourself...
It was stupid
and careless.
Body was made of high-end latex.
If I'd bothered to look inside
when I brought him home...
Sir, please, remember how distraught
you were. Even I found it hard...
Stupid and careless.
- Where are you going?
- To talk to the man who did this.
I hope you understand the
trouble I've gone through...
to arrange this little
get-together here.
A lot of money. A lot of dead meat.
Look, I've got a problem.
And you are absolutely the man
who possesses the gifts...
to take care of this problem.
I need you to murder the Red Hood.
You think you can handle that?
May I have some water?
I'm going to need something to wear...
and a very big truck.
Sure. Anything else?
I'll need some guys.
Not these guys because,
well, they're kind of dead.
What did you do to Jason?
Act like you don't
know what I'm talking
about and I'll dislocate
the shoulder.
That's just to start.
If you haven't disabled
the roof sensors,
my guards will be here
in under a minute.
Answer me.
I'm willing to...
but it'll be more
expedient if you
hand me the communicator
in my pocket...
and I call off my men.
Commander, this is Ra's Al Ghul.
Stand down.
I will be entertaining
a guest in my study.
You remember when we
last became embattled?
You were planning to blow up banks.
Accurate, if inelegant.
I was in the midst of toppling
the economy of Europe...
but you were on to me.
I sought a distraction.
So I hired the Joker.
When your paths crossed in Bosnia...
it was to appear
that you had stumbled upon him.
He was paid extremely well for what
was intended to be a wild-goose chase.
Then he murdered the boy.
That was not by design.
I'm afraid I overestimated my ability
to control the Joker...
just as I underestimated
his madness.
It grieved me, sir...
to be a party to
something so brutal.
You've never shied away
from drawing blood.
True, but always with purpose.
Always with greater goals.
This was simply an
unnecessary casualty.
As penance, I chose not to
make war with you again...
and to attempt
to rectify this disservice.
Rectify?
Yes.
I had hoped to return to
you what you had lost.
I have walked this world
for nearly six centuries.
As you know...
I achieve this by bathing in the
rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit.
Along with its healing abilities...
it has long been rumored that it
is capable of an even greater feat...
to raise the dead.
Procuring the remains of your
partner was not difficult.
You had come to Bosnia under
the guise of Bruce Wayne...
and you chose to depart as such.
You even concocted the cover story...
that young Jason had died
in a bombing in Sarajevo.
This made it easy for me.
All it took was a few payoffs
to replace his body.
I felt confident that you would
not perform an autopsy...
even if you had,
we still would have bought enough time.
But my plan...
well, detective,
it had unfortunate results.
He returned to this world...
but returned damaged.
My army searched for months...
but we were never able to
find a body or pick up a trail.
I thought him dead yet again.
But I hear you have been
having trouble at home.
I have returned your son to you
as a blight upon your house.
He burns the very kingdom you...
protect.
Shall I alert the guards to pursue him?
Don't be foolish.
They would never catch him.
Besides, I have done enough.
Sir, please take this to heart.
Who Jason was before,
how we lost him...
and this dark miracle or curse
that has brought about his return...
it is not your fault.
I know you view his death
as your greatest failure but...
His life and his death
are my greatest failure.
Do you remember how he
was when I found him?
Of course, sir.
Fearless, arrogant, brash and gifted.
Yes.
Different than Dick in so many ways...
but still so full of
potential and power.
But I knew, even from the
beginning, he was dangerous.
If I hadn't made him into Robin,
he would have grown to do wrong.
Then I got him killed.
My partner.
My soldier.
My fault.
I own that.
I'll carry that like everything else.
But now there's this.
He's taken everything I've ever
taught him and turned it on me.
It's a hell of my own making, Alfred.
Sir, this is not your doing.
You loved him: He knows that.
- It should be enough.
- It's not.
Reporting live
from Gotham Bay Bridge...
My word.
Sir, patch into the media feed now.
Come on, get out of there, now.
Don't know what that
maniac's up to, but
nobody make a move
till I give the order.
I'm a little teapot.
Short and stout.
Here is my handle Here is my spout.
This wasn't part of the
damn deal, you freak!
Get me out of here right now!
I thought you'd enjoy
seeing some old faces.
After all, most of these
guys used to work for you.
Who's that? Get a light on him.
Up there.
Hey, look at you. Mr. Hood.
Or do you prefer Red?
I used to wear an
outfit a lot like that.
Mine was more flashy maitre
d' than motorcycle fetish.
You kids today.
I'm sorry, could you hold on?
I was just in the middle of
setting fire to your gang.
Go ahead.
You think I care if that scum dies?
Don't know. I just
wanted your attention.
You've always had my attention.
But what I really wanted
was an audience with you.
I'm sorry, that seems to imply that
you organized this little clambake.
I did. Sure, I had lots of plans...
but the endgame was getting Black
Mask so desperate that he'd cut a deal.
He was the only one with the
connections to get into Arkham...
and get you out.
You can't trust anybody.
So I've been bamboozled.
Oh, my.
I wouldn't undersell it.
It took a lot of work to
bring about our reunion.
Reunion? Have we met before?
Yes, we have.
Well, here's to warm memories.
I've got him.
You want him? Meet me at crime alley.
Okay.
So, what's the plan?
Slumber party? Charades?
A little Truth or Dare?
Yes. I'll start with "dare."
well, maybe I'll just go with "truth."
Tell me, how does that feel?
You know, it only hurts when I laugh.
But, hey, I gotta know.
Who are you?
You said we knew one another,
and you do seem really familiar.
We double at the prom?
Or maybe blow up a school bus together?
No. I'm just something you helped make.
That's pretty cryptic...
but interesting.
Tell me more.
Sure. Listen up.
Unreal.
Hello.
So glad you could make it.
This ends tonight. All of it.
Nobody knows that better than me.
Ha. Oh, you and your gadgets.
You're not the only one with toys.
Crap.
Look at you.
I guess we should keep it even.
Jason.
Yes.
I don't wanna fight you.
All evidence to the contrary.
Please, I can help you.
I know what happened.
Oh, you got to talking with Ra's, huh?
Does it make it easier for you to think
that my dip in his fountain of youth...
turned me rabid?
Or is this just the real me?
Tell me...
what bothers you more,
that your greatest
failure has returned
from the grave?
Or that I've become a
better Batman than you?
You're ruling through intimidation
and murder. Just another criminal.
I'm what this city needs.
Hidden goodies all over, huh? We're
both just a couple of walking armories.
Maybe so, but let's see how
you do without your toys.
Enough. It's over.
You say you wanna be better than me.
But it won't happen.
Not like this.
I know I failed you...
but I tried to save you, Jason.
I'm trying to save you now.
Is that what you think this is about?
That you let me die? I don't know
what clouds your judgment worse.
Your guilt or your antiquated
sense of morality.
Bruce, I forgive you for not saving me.
But why? Why on God's earth...
is he still Alive?
Gotta give the boy points.
He came all the way back from the dead
to make this shindig happen.
So who's got a camera?
Ooh! Ooh!
Get one of me and the kid first.
Then you and me, then the three of us.
And then one with the crowbar. Then...
You'll be as quiet as possible
or I'll put one in your lap first.
Party pooper. No cake for you.
Ignoring what he's done in the past.
Blindly, stupidly, disregarding
the entire graveyards he's filled...
the thousands who have suffered,
the friends he's crippled.
You know, I thought...
I thought I'd be the last
person you'd ever let him hurt.
If it had been you that he
beat to a bloody pulp...
if he had taken you from this world,
I would've done nothing...
but search the planet
for this pathetic
pile of evil
death-worshipping garbage...
and sent him off to hell.
You don't understand.
I don't think you've ever understood.
What?
What, your moral code just
won't allow for that?
It's too hard to cross that line?
No. God Aimighty, no.
It'd be too damned easy.
All I've ever wanted to do is kill him.
A day doesn't go by I don't
think about subjecting him...
to every horrendous torture he's
dealt out to others and then end him.
Aw. So you do think about me.
But if I do that...
if I allow myself to go down
into that place...
I'll never come back.
Why? I'm not talking about killing
Penguin or Scarecrow or Dent.
I'm talking about him. Just him.
And doing it because...
Because he took me away from you.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
That is so sweet.
Well, you won't have a choice.
- I won't...
- This is what it's all been about.
This.
You, and me and him.
Now is the time you decide.
If you won't kill this psychotic
piece of filth, I will.
If you wanna stop me, you're
gonna have to kill me.
You know I won't...
I'm gonna blow his
deranged brains out.
And if you wanna stop it, you
are gonna have to shoot me.
Right in my face.
This is turning out even
better than I'd hoped.
It's him or me, you have to decide.
Decide now. Do it.
Him or me? Decide.
I can't believe you got him.
You expert, rooting-tooting,
eagle-eyed, goth-loving marksman.
I love it.
You managed to find a way to win.
And everybody still loses.
No, don't spoil it. This is better.
I'm the only one who's gonna
get what he wants tonight.
Yes, bing, bang, boom.
We all go out together.
Don't you just love a happy ending?
Sources
close to the district
attorney's office
have intimated...
the case will likely be dropped
due to lack of evidence.
But the Black Mask
is still under
investigation for his
alleged complicity...
in Joker's escape from Arkham.
The guards charged with aiding
and abetting the escape...
were found murdered
in the Gotham courthouse jail...
while the alleged crime lord,
Black Mask, was released...
on $1 million bail
for his suspected involvement...
and is currently awaiting a hearing.
Meanwhile, the Joker has been
returned to Arkham Asylum.
Officials claim extra
measures have been taken...
to ensure another escape
would be impossible.
Prior to his arrest,
Black Mask was being strong-armed...
by the mysterious Red Hood.
Sir.
In light of all the recent events,
would you like me to remove that?
No.
This doesn't change anything.
It doesn't change anything at all.
Okay, let's go.
If you can't suit up
quickly at home base...
I'm concerned how you would
handle it in the field.
Perhaps he's primping.
As I recall, Master
Richard spent nearly
half an hour admiring
his reflection...
the first time he donned his cape.
Jason, get on out here or I'm
going on patrol without you.
- Ha!
- My word.
- Gotcha.
- Would have...
if I hadn't seen you slip behind
the computer banks three minutes ago.
- No, I got you.
- How does it feel?
It feels awesome.
Check me out.
I'm Robin, the Boy wonder.
Are you kidding me? This rocks.
Come on, old man, we've got
bad guys who need chasing.
This is the best day of my life.
