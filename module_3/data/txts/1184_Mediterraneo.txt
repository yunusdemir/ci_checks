IN TIME LIKE THESE ESCAPE IS THE
ONLY WAY TO STAY ALIVE...
AND TO CONTINUE DREAMING.
(HENRY LABORIT)
MEDITERRANEO
They send us on a mission on
Mighisti, a lost Aegean isle...
the smallest and most distant one.
Its strategic importance was zero.
Our orders were to
observe and make contact.
We were to occupy and report.
The men assigned to me came from...
here and there. Survivors from
lost battles...
men from disbanded regiments.
A platoon of misfits like myself,
who had happened to survive.
Eliseo Strazzabosco, the mule-driver
was a strange guy.
He'd spent the whole war with his
Silvana. He'd brought her from home.
He loved her like a person.
Maybe even more.
Hey, Strazzabosco!
"La Dolce Vita", eh?
A honeymoon in the Aegean.
I think tonight...
Pretend you didn't hear.
Don't give them the satisfaction.
There were the Munaron brothers,
Libero and Felice.
Two mountain boys who had
never seen the sea.
And there were Lo Russo
and Colasanti.
You got anything to drink?
Lo Russo ha reached the rank of Sergeant
Major in the African Campaign.
What might he have become by the wars
end? Colasanti, the signalman...
...lived in Lo Russo's shadow practically
in symbiosis. Then there was Corrado...
...Noventa, the deserter.
He'd already escaped a few times,
trying to get home.
His wife was pregnant.
Last time they caught him...
...between Albania and Yugoslavia,
trying to walk home to Italy.
My attendant, Antonio Farina,
was very devoted to me...
...always ready for orders, at times
even anticipating my thoughts.
- How much longer, Lieutenant?
- Not much.
- Will there be shooting?
- Let's hope not.
We were all at the age where
one hasn't decided whether...
...to start a family or
lose oneself in the world.
Lieutenant, how long do we
have to stay here?
Four months.
Damn!
Silvana, don't make a fuss.
Don't make me look bad to the
Sergeant. Calm down, relax!
Try to take deep breaths.
In ... and out ... and in.
It starts great ...
-What's the problem?
-We cannot swim.
-Munaron!
-Give me the radio.
-Take it easy.
-There is a pit.
Be careful with the radio, guys.
Can I get some help with Silvana?
Come on now! Could you not left
that damned donkey home?
Shall we put on our gas masks
at once, sir?
-No, no masks.
-Why'd we bring all this stuff?
-She has become lame.
-What do you mean?
-At disembarkation.
-Lieutenant, what's written there?
- Greece is the tomb "ton Italon".
- What does "ton Italon" mean?
All right, men. We'll all advance
very quietly inland.
Keep your eyes open. Strazza, at the
rear. Colasanti, in the middle to...
...make sure the radio is safe. Once on top,
we'll establish a base. Understood?
Yes, but what does
"ton Italon" mean?
"Of Italians. "
- What?
- "Greece is the tomb of Italians. "
There's nobody here.
- Your head's burning. You're hot, eh?
- Hell!
No objections? I'll go in.
This time we agree?
Not a fucking soul!
There's nobody in this town.
Are you crazy?
Didn't you see me? I'm Farina.
Excuse, me! You almost killed me!
- We heard a shot, so we fired.
- Who the hell fired?
- Farina did, Lieutenant!
- We saw him fire.
- He shot, so we fired.
- Wait! Lieutenant, I saw the hole thing.
Farina got attacked by a chicken and
reacted. The men, taken by surprise...
...thought we were being attacked
by Greek chickens.
Let's not kid around.
You could have killed him!
- It hadn't been a big loss...
- Stop joking.
I was only joking. I meant
better a dead chicken than...
It was just to keep up the morale of
the troops. You're a bunch of idiots!
-Sorry. I didn't meant that.
-It doesn’t matter. I was hot.
-Where have all gone?
-Sometimes I have a feeling.
And this is really weird.
It happened something similar in Africa.
-What happened?
-Nothing.
A patrol went out
on reconnaissance.
They found a deserted village
where they stopped to sleep.
Following morning
there were only bones left.
-Whose bones?
-Patrols. They were eaten.
-Everyone. What savages!
-What's that nonsense?
-It's not.
-But we are not in Africa now.
There should be no cannibals here.
What do you know?
Do you know what Greeks eat?
The monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
Reply if you can hear me, over.
-How is she, Strazzabosco?
-She has pain in her hoof.
The flag is up, Lieutenant.
-Monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
-They fled when they saw us coming.
-There's not even a boat.
-Monastery, call's the Savoy, over.
They are probably hiding in the mountains and
attack when it became dark. A classic one.
The monastery, call's the Savoy,
reply if you hear me, over.
-Try to keep your eyes open, guys.
-I have contact!
Hello? The monastery here. Can you hear me,
Garibaldi, password? The mission is completed.
No contact with the enemy.
The situation is under control.
We are awaiting new orders. Over.
-Top priority.
Orders from above.
We are on a mission.
From now on we interrupt
all radio contact. Over and out.
Colasanti? Colasanti?
-Well?
-Nothing.
Guys, you have to behave properly
against the Greeks.
There are no cannibals here,
but they once took a soldier...
...and hung him in his feet’s and
poured hot oil in the ass of him.
-How?
-With a funnel.
Goddamn!
You lowers the troop's morality.
No, I tell you, not to do any nonsense.
Can you pass me the chicken?
-What did you do before the war?
- I was unemployed...
...I have studied. Then I was
unemployed, and I started study...
...again but then, I quit. And you?
Teacher of science.
No comments!
Felice? Do you see anything?
Me neither.
-Look, Libero!
-Make a wish.
Hope that all may return home safe.
Yeah, so do I.
The one with hope when he's alive,
shit himself when he dies.
Said of Lo Russo on a meaningless
island in the Aegean Sea in 1941.
I am also a writer. Good night.
-Sergeant-Major!
-What is it?
-Good night.
-Go and shit.
One doesn't smoke
on guard duty.
Fuck off, Strazzabosco!
If they spot your cigarette, they
can shoot you in the forehead.
What are you smoking?
Milit.
Give me a drag.
I gave you a scare, huh?
- What's happening?
- Did you hear? Look!
Alarm!
Libero!
- Who the hell yelled?
- Farina gave the alarm.
-Move it!
-Come on, hurry!
-What's happening?
-Look there!
We're kicking their asses, eh?
Lieutenant, our side is
really beating them!
R.N Garibaldi.
Lieutenant, I hear something
but it's mostly static.
-I'm connected...
...here, Lieutenant.
- What do they say?
- Wait.
<i>...contact with enemy affected.</i>
What about our man?
Where are they?
Wait, I don't understand.
- It's the British.
- They're speaking English.
<i>...repeat no survivers.</i>
Lieutenant, tell us, too.
- What about us?
- I don' know!
You don't know!
- What'll do know?
- Boy, I don't know.
I understand.
Everyone in position! Maximum alert!
Stay alert and don't move. The Brits...
could land any minute.
Understood?
<i>Stay here Silvana, its dangereous.</i>
<i>Come on!</i>
Stop, who's there?
It's me, Lo Russo.
- Password.
- It's me, I said.
- Identify yourself. Password?
- I told you, it's me, Lo Russo.
The password, or we shoot.
All right...
"Savoy or death".
Ok, Sergeant, you may come closer.
Ok, my ass!
Counter password?
"Memento audere semper. "
No, you're wrong.
- "Lightning!
- No!
- That's was yesterday's password.
- "Pizza Margherita!"
Sure! "Four Seasons"!
- It's "Queen Margherita"!
- Yes, it's "Queen Margherita".
We're supposed to conquer Greece
with these four idiots?!
Tomorrow I'll turn you all in.
Understood?
- Go take a shit!
- Who said that?
Who?
Come on out! Bastards!
I know that one.
I recognized him. Ass-face!
It wasn't me!
It wasn't me!
"It wasn't me!" Two days' punishment
for all and four days for ass-face!
Quiet!
What's that?
The British, I feel it.
Who goes there?
The password!
Identify yourself, or I shoot.
Lieutenant, if it's you, say so.
No! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.
Silvana!
My Silvana.
It was Silvana, boys, but...
But I gave you specific orders...
- You said to shoot, and we obeyed.
- No. I said, "Stop, who goes there?"
"Identify yourself or I'll shoot. "
Lieutenant, I said, "Identify yourself
or I'll shoot. " These guys fired.
Strazza,
it wasn't our fault.
Bastards!
- Easy!
- Bastards!
This morning the chickens, now the
donkey! How will we carry the stuff?
- The radio!
- Shit! My radio!
<i>Silvana...</i>
- Broken?
- I don't know.
- Can it be fixed?
- I don't know.
- Why don't you know?
- I said I don't know.
It was our most important equipment!
To be kept in top working condition!
We depended on it, and then that
creature of a mountain man broke it!
Don't yell. Blaming him won't
help now. Stay calm.
Calm, my ass! Stay calm, my ass!
We're cut off from the war!
How do we communicate now?
With smoke signals?
My Silvana...
There's nothing.
Ok. Boys, you'll stay here.
For observation and liaison.
When you see a ship, send up the
signal flares. Toward us, not them.
In two, three days
I'll send another shift.
Don't worry about us. We're
not too familiar with the sea.
If the relief shift isn't
obligatory, we'll stay here.
We'll come get our supplies.
- Suit yourselves.
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant, one second.
Munaron.
The mission "C" is now documented.
See you.
ITALY, I THINK AND DREAM OF YOU.
Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning.
Some ghost island!
- An island of ghosts. There's nobody here.
- The radio?
- Any news?
- I've reassembled it. It won't work.
I put him in the kitchen.
He has been a chef.
He is a master
in cooking eel in tomato sauce.
Lieutenant, he is a master
in cooking eel in tomato sauce.
Good. You made right in.
I am a little worried about the boys.
It doesn't just happen. Strazzabosco
is always for himself.
And now Silvana is death,
he is given gay.
There is nothing wrong with that, but
this telegram condemning it.
-Why?
-Because he is among the soldiers.
Because he lives among men.
Alexander the Great, also,
although he was a great warrior.
-Was he gay?
-Sure.
But it was in the ancient Greek.
It was so long ago.
It is not only what I find out.
We have received a telegram.
Combat all ''homosexuality.''
''Punish all sexual
relationships within the squad.''
It is not my invention.
So let's invent something to
boost their morale.
We could have them
dig a nice trench.
- What for?
- Nothing. They'll dig it and cover it up.
- They'll get demoralized.
- Let's mount a simulated attack.
- In this heat?
- Then what can I do to...
- keep up their spirits?
- Listen, Lo Russo, think of something.
Now excuse me. I have to
update the military diary.
I didn't realize...
- Farina, are you married?
- No.
- Engaged?
- No.
- Is anyone back home waiting for you?
- My folks died when I was little.
I never knew them.
It's nice here, right?
Well...
This may seem like an arid place,
a place for sheep...
but here, 2,500 years ago, before Rome,
there was a beautiful civilization.
There were poets, philosophers,
warriors, goddesses.
We're all their descendants. Even you can
find your origins here. You understand?
Do you like poetry?
It depends.
Look... these were written
seven centuries before Christ.
You know how to read?
- Not in Greek.
- Each poem is translated.
The mountain peaks sleep, along with
the valleys, cliffs and gorges...
and creatures of the brown earth...
Wake up! They've landed!
I saw them! They're here!
Lieutenant, wake up!
- What happened, Sergeant?
- Where did they land?
- They're everywhere! Many of them!
- The British?
No! I tried catching one,
but they disappeared.
- Who are they?
- Children.
Strange, isn't it?
There are no men.
- Just old men and children.
- It's fishy.
- It could be an ambush.
- I remember similar situation in Spain.
- Sure, sure!
- Not again!
Well, don't complain to me later...
Madame, hello.
The men... the soldiers,
where are they?
She still has a papa?
You can speak Italian to me.
I spent twenty years in Roma.
Italians... Greeks...
my face, my race...
One face, one race.
Father, where did all of you go?
Why wasn't anyone here
when we arrived?
The Germans were here before you.
They destroyed all the houses
and sank the boats.
They took all our men away...
deported them.
When we saw your ship, we
thought they had come back.
So... we hid.
I know the Italians well.
We don't like strangers in
our country, but...
it's lesser of two evils.
I assure you, we'll create the
least possible disturbance.
I'd advise you to move into
the Mayor's house.
You'll be more comfortable.
Where are you going?
We're friends!
Friends, friends.
Wait! Come here!
Regulations prohibit
fraternizing with the locals.
The first one who touches
woman, hen or rooster...
will be court-martialed.
Understood?
Why are you always screaming?
Help us instead.
Sergeant Lo Russo screams
whenever he wants to because...
sergeants scream.
Is that clear? Is that clear?
A good hand!
I'm just a dilettante.
This man reminds me of the picture
of Homer in my school textbook.
For the first time since I
left home I feel good.
You're strange, you know?
You don't seem like a soldier.
The army called me back. In peacetime
I'm a high school teacher.
- Did I speak it right?
- You speak Greek very well.
I learned Greek through books.
The Iliad, the Odyssey, the poets.
I teach about Greece but I've never
been here. With my salary...
Who knows. Maybe this is destiny.
Maybe I'm asking too much...
but... have you seen our church?
It's badly damaged.
Would you consider...
painting... the walls?
I'd be honored but I'm not
good enough to paint frescoes.
Of course you're good enough!
For free, of course.
Sergeant, I found these
enormous peppers.
For your backache I'll fix
a board for your bed.
I'm also fixing up a piece
of leather...
Be careful!
Leather...
- How will you cook the peppers?
- Stuffed.
Sergeant!
Hi, Noventa.
- Guess what I've got.
- A letter.
Yes, to my wife.
I'll leave it with you?
Yes, I'll send it.
- It's important. How long will it take?
- Like the others.
- I didn't put a stamp.
- No problem. You can go, Noventa.
Thanks.
- You've seen the lieutenant?
- No.
- The lieutenant's not here?
- No.
There's a woman outside asking
to talk to the commander.
- The lieutenant isn't here?
- The lieutenant's painting frescoes.
We're sweating here,
he's in a cool church.
Should I show her in?
If she wants to talk, show her in.
If not, she can stay outside.
Lo Russo...
beautiful.
She's beautiful.
That's her.
- Good morning.
- You're the captain?
Yes, I am.
- I'm Vassilissa. Vassilissa.
- Vassilissa?
- Yes.
- A beautiful name.
I'm Lo Russo...
Nicola.
- I speak... for "Duliam".
- I don't know "Duliam". Sorry.
You don't?
Ergassia, you understand?
Do we know Ergassia?
Duliam Ergassia?
- Work!... Work!
- Work?
You want to talk about work?
What kind of work do you do?
I'm a "puta".
- "Puta" is Greek for...?
- A whore.
- Please!
- Yes! Right! Whore! Yes.
Good.
Good... I mean... there are different
ways of saying the same thing.
You're interested?
I have to glance at
the regulations...
- but we're very... we'd be interested.
- Fine.
And where... let's say... do you
conduct your... where do these...
- manifestations take place? The house?
- My house.
- Your house.
- The blue house... blue.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Off on Thursday.
Friday, Saturday, double shifts.
Sunday: Day off. Understood?
- Why not alternate days?
- Because this is what I decided.
The order is based on age and rank.
So, I'm first.
- The lieutenant's first.
- He doesn't go to prostitute. I'm first.
Then Colasanti, then Noventa,
Strazzabosco and then little Farina.
- And the two brothers?
- The damn Munarons!
Mind your own business!
I'm asking for a volunteer to call
the two brothers up in the mountain.
Without a volunteer, the
brothers stay where they are.
Speak to me of love, Marie.
All my life, it's you.
Your lovely eyes are shining
Like two stars, they twinkle
- Sergeant?
- Thanks, dear.
Tell me it's not a dream...
I destroyed her.
Tell me you're all mine.
Instead of reading poetry, sing!
You'll stop being afraid.
Here, under your heart,
I'm no longer suffering.
Bye.
Vassilissa...
Miss Vassilissa.
Vassilissa!
Farina, get the ball!
- She won't give it to me.
- Get going! Get it!
Thanks.
Alarm flares from the Munarons.
Call the Lieutenant!
All civilians in their homes!
The enemy's here! Hurry!
Who is it? The British?
I don't see anyone yet!
Lieutenant, Lieutenant.
- You signaled the alarm?
- Yes, Lieutenant.
It's a ship with a red flag.
- Shit! The Russians.
- The flag's not exactly Russian.
- It's more like Turkish.
- Yeah, Turkish.
- Are the Turks on our side?
- What kind of ship?
- Like a fishing boat.
- A fishing boat.
You signaled about a fishing boat?
- We were told to report anything...
- You did well. It could be a spy.
There he is.
Italians... Turks...
One face, one race!
I think it isn't only tobacco.
Say what you want. There's something
else in it. Not just tobacco.
The smoke of oblivion.
Like in the Odyssey.
Odyssey.
It tastes like sage.
Tell me, do you have other stuff?
Opium...
cash...
No, I meant rugs and such things.
No rugs, no rugs.
Lieutenant, rugs, cash, opium, who
gives a damn! He doesn't know anything.
- What's happening? What is going on?
- Where?
Where else? In Italy... in Europe!
- Dunno.
- What "dunno"?
I mean Mussolini,
Hitler, Germany!
- Dunno!
- What?! Where did you come from?
Cash... Antalya... Fatie...
no war.
- Let's confiscate the boat.
- Why?
To go to Rhodes, to Italy.
- To where things are happening.
- Do you care that much?
Yes! We're in this God-forsaken place.
We don't know what's
happening anywhere.
Aren't you curious? I say, let's go to
the front where there's action.
Fine...
let's vote.
Whoever agrees with the sergeant
to confiscate poor Aziz's boat...
to face a very dangerous journey
to Rhodes for two days...
without any certainty of arriving,
raise your hand.
Whoever whishes to stay,
raise your hand.
I don't vote because of my rank.
We stay.
What kind of vote is that?
We're staying on the
island of oblivion.
Smoke some oblivion!
It was a rigged vote.
Did you ever think
we'd end up here?
Did you eat chicken with your finger?
You pipe's glued to your hands.
Pass it around!
- What's chicken got to do with oblivion?
- They both stick to your fingers.
I think this stuff is prohibited
in Italy right now.
Why?
Under Fascism everything good
is prohibited.
- Would you, Emperor, legalize it?
- Who, the raisin?
- What raisin?
- What are you talking about?
- As Emperor...
- Sergeant Lo Russo.
No guard duty... Savoy, eh?
To the boat!
I don't agree.
With the sloppy and relaxed attitude
that prevails among you.
Being a comrade, I can't go in
against the tide...
I can't go against the wishes
of the majority.
I also understand your rebellious
attitude toward authority because of...
- the absolute negligence of the state.
- What the fuck are you saying, Lo Russo?
What are you saying?
I'm saying what I'm saying.
I too feel...
abandoned by my country,
by Italy.
And I don't give a shit!
And I'll say it again!
They left us here, and here we'll stay!
They said, "You'll manage", and...
we're managing.
- What are they saying, Aziz?
- Dunno.
You always "dunno".
You dunno nothing!
Hi, Aziz. Friend... friend!
Take me home!
Take me along! Friends!
Italy, Turkey...
one face, one race!
He stole everything! Everything!
Now what! We stay here like
a bunch of idiots.
Never trust the Turks.
Hell, don't laugh, Father!
We don't even have a weapon.
How can we occupy the island?
Come with me.
Come with me.
We've had weapons all along.
We're friends, right?
Why won't you make love
with me?
- Because.
- Are you embarrassed?
What's the most beautiful
thing on earth?
Some say a swarm of knights, others
say infantrymen, yet others say ships.
I say it's the one I love. And then it
continues. A Greek poet wrote it...
over 2,000 years ago.
Yes, but why won't you make
love with me? Why?
- I've never done it.
- Never?
But...
I want the first time
to be for love...
really for love, you understand?
Life isn't enough...
One life isn't enough for me.
There aren't enough days...
too many things to do,
too many ideas...
Every sunset upsets me because
another day has gone by.
Then I'm moved,
because I'm alone...
a tiny dot in the universe.
I'd like to watch sunsets
with my mother...
or with a woman I might love.
I'd like to spend the nights
alone... alone, or...
maybe with a beautiful slut
which is better than alone...
Did the Turk leave any of that stuff?
"Dunno" was his name.
Thanks.
If things were always this way...
if they took your weapons and left
this stuff, we'd live better, right?
- Come on, come on.
- We're coming.
- You go first.
- No, you go.
- No, I won't go!
- Go!
You know what Father always said?
"If necessary, float on shit. "
- I'd like to see him!
- Ready? One, two, three...
Vassilissa, what about this?
Mine.
- A gun in your kitchen?
- For the enemies.
- May I ask you something?
- What?
I've been waiting to ask you...
No, no, nothing. Never mind.
Go ahead. Go on.
How come you're a...
How come you're... a...
- Prostitute?
- Yes.
My mother is a prostitute.
My grandmother's a prostitute.
My sister's a prostitute.
Logical, isn't it?
Logical... logical.
What did you do before?
Where were you?
Why did you come here?
- Here?
- Yes.
In Athens I worked with the Germans.
The Germans brought me here.
They left.
I stayed.
The end.
- You like it here? You want to stay here?
- I don't know.
It's fine here... for now.
But you'll...
you'll always, always be...
A prostitute?
I...
I... I don't know.
Maybe I'll open a tavern.
- It's a massacre! Penalty!
- I didn't hurt him!
- Lieutenant, fuck off!
- You fuck off!
Calm down!
Now... it's a penalty.
On two conditions.
One: That you do the kicking.
Two: That I do the blocking.
I'm hypnotizing you!
It's already blocked!
The pepper got you, eh?
Go on!
Kick!
It's been 15 minutes!
I hypnotized you, but...
Don't show me where you'll kick...
It's already blocked.
Move away!
What the hell?
My God!
He's Italian. He's one of us.
- Italians?
- Lieutenant Raffaele Montini.
Sergeant Nicola Lo Russo.
Lieutenant Carmelo La Rosa.
Anyway, I saw it. There was no penalty.
You are Italian soldiers?
I had engine trouble, nothing
serious, just a coupling.
I'm headed for Crete. Our division
was united with the British.
- The British?!
- Sure! They have...
some incredible planes! The British
and the Americans are very organized.
British and Americans?
Did you surrender?
Who?
You don't know about anything!
Not even September 8th?
So what? Every year there's
September 8, 9, 10...
What about September 8th?
- How long have you been here?
- Since June.
- June of what year?
- '41.
- '41, '42... '43... Three years?
- What?
You've been here three years?
Hear that? Three years.
He's been here three years!
- We've all been here three years!
- All of you?
We arrived together.
Then you know nothing?
You have no radio, or anything?
- We had one.
- I'll explain it all. Mussolini fell.
Italy is divided. South,
the British and Americans.
North: The Germans and Fascists.
In between the CLN.
- What's the CLN?
- National Liberation Committee...
the partisans. There's a civil war.
Friends have become enemies,
and vice versa.
There's lots of turmoil, many
opportunities, and much to do.
We can't remain outside of it.
There are big ideals at stake.
Lots of money can be made.
Done!
- It's fixed.
- And this?
The plane's got too many parts! That
piece is useless. Leave it there.
I'll let headquarters know you're here.
A ship or something might come by.
If you get back, drop in on me in
Palermo. Bring the woman, the wives...
whatever, anybody!
Three years! Hard to believe!
Three years!
Come on! Take me along!
Why can't you?
- Hey, just a minute.
- Take me home!
- Take me home!
- Take it easy! Calm down.
I am calm.
I want to go home.
You could at least have
taken the letters!
It's over.
Soon they'll come for us...
and take us home.
And we won't see each other again.
I don't know how many men
I've been with.
I don't remember any
of their faces.
When you leave, I won't remember...
you, either.
Yes...
Me, you'll remember.
Let's do it?
Why?
- A nice game, right?
- Yes, nice.
- Look who's spoiling everything.
- Mind your own business!
You're just lucky, Pope!
The dice are round, but still...
I knew it! I'll never get used to it.
It's like drinking sand.
Let it settle on the bottom.
Learn to wait.
Smell the aroma, and wait.
That's the enjoyment.
What are you saying? Coffee is coffee!
You order it, drink it and leave. Shit!
Wait! Everybody waits!
What's there to wait for?
- I'll check it.
- What happened?
- Hi. What happened?
- Farina shot at me.
- What?
- It was my turn.
He's inside with her. He wouldn't let
me in. I knocked and knocked...
and started knocking down the door.
He shot at me from the window.
- Is he crazy?
- It seems impossible. What's going on?
- Antonio?
- Go away, all of you! You understand?
Leave us alone.
- He's gone nuts!
- What'll we do? What'll we do?
- Go get Raffaele.
- Me?
- Should I go?
- Why me?
- I could go.
- Should he go? Go on!
Does it hurt? It must hurt a little.
See? It hurts. Go on!
Go, Garibaldi! That guy shoots!
- Nino?
- One step closer and I shoot!
Oh, he talks big!
Fuck off, Nino!
- He's real crazy.
- An idiot! Real scary.
- It's true.
- Let's see it. Does it hurt?
It's not serious.
- Just a scratch.
- What the hell got into him?
He's inside with Vassilissa
and won't let anyone in.
- Why?
- He won't respect the scheduled turns.
Talk to him.
Nino! Raffaele's here
to see you.
Antonio, what are you doing?
Nobody' to touch Vassilissa!
That goes for you too, Lieutenant.
O.K., Antonio, but that's her
line of work.
I mean, she's taken certain
psychophysical needs to heart...
she's proposing a solution...
- I mean, she's a prostitute.
- Not after today! I love her.
- What?
- I love her, Lieutenant. I love her.
He loves her.
Vassilissa?
Do you love him, too?
Yes.
Boys, that changes everything.
How can we go against feelings?
- We can't?
- What do you say?
We can't.
His feelings shot me in the arm.
Oh, come on, it's not serious.
I have to go back...
The color is drying up.
Best wishes and lots of male children...
my color's drying.
Get that disinfected.
One guy's color dries,
another guy's wound dries. Let's go.
Sorry.
Now Vassilissa and Antonio
are man and wife.
Drink to your marriage.
And then you, Antonio,
will break the glass...
to make sure nothing will
interfere with your happiness.
Italians are like Turks, huh?
One race, one stomach!
Lieutenant.
Where's Noventa?
I don't know.
Know what this reminds me of?
When the vacation was over.
That's when we went back to school.
Vacation was over and we headed home.
This atmosphere here reminds
me of that moment.
I wonder if it's right.
The world changes, and we're here.
Right or not, that' how it is.
It's destiny.
Destiny!
Destiny... can be manipulated...
You can try to have things
go as you'd like.
One can change destiny.
It's not easy. Sometimes
one has to obey destiny.
Did you see that star?
Did you make a wish?
It's not easy.
Know what I'd like?
A nice ship to take me away.
Not that it's bad here. But...
I'm beginning to feel...
a need for a person. Someone...
to be in love with.
Sergeant, I...
I could be that person.
I'm in love with you.
I don't know how the hell
it happened.
They're British!
- Can we be sure they're friends now?
- Things change.
Italians.
- What did he say? I didn't hear it.
- "Italians".
What the fuck do they want?
Dimitri.
Dimitri! They are taliani, are taliani.
Who are those guys?
They used to live here.
They're coming home.
Not allowed... not allowed to
take animal on the boat.
He and I, we're together.
And we're going home together.
To Italy.
If he can't go, I won't go either.
I'll stay. I won't move.
Try to move me!
See? A little reasoning...
Come, Garibaldi.
How much stuff are you taking?
Sergeant...
What is this?
We'll never see each other again?
Not again!
We have the whole ocean trip!
Where's Farina?
I can't fucking find him.
- I'll look for him.
- How much stuff are you taking?
- Where is he?
- I don't know.
- Tell me where! They'll leave him here!
- I don't know!
- What's up?
- "What's up?"?
What's up?
What do you want?
What do you mean, "What's up?"?
Come out and let's go!
I won't come. This is my house.
I'm married... I'm staying here.
Those guys won't wait.
They're British. Your marriage isn't
valid in Italy. Move it! Let's go!
It's valid for me. Very valid.
Bring her too. Let's go!
They won't wait!
Where to? Where?
I have no home, no job. I'm alone.
Why should I leave? No!
Everything's changing. Italy needs
rebuilding from the ground up.
There's much confusion.
It's a great opportunity.
We'll build a great nation,
I promise you. It's also our duty.
What duty? Even you agreed.
Remember?
They forgot about us.
I want to forget them.
Rebuild Italy, chance the world!
I don't believe in it. I can't.
I'm staying here.
In an olive barrel on a deserted island?
Is that your ambition?
I feel alive, here, for the
first time. You understand?
Vassilissa wants to start a
restaurant. She needs me.
Don't be upset, Sergeant.
We're friends, aren't we?
Attendant Farina, this is
desertion, you know that.
- I love you.
- Me too.
I can't believe in it.
An olive?
- I'm not hungry.
- Take one.
I said I'm not hungry.
Farina disappeared completely.
Disappeared. I looked everywhere.
- He must have fled to the mountains!
- Probably.
Maybe he's right.
Raffaele, we're going to
build a great nation.
You'll see. He'll come back to live
there, too. You'll see.
Give me an olive.
Italians, Greeks,
my race, my face
one face... one race...
Where did you end up?
RESTAURANT VASSILISSA
Lieutenant!
Antonio, I'm so very sorry.
I wasn't sure about the address.
Thank you.
Thanks, Lieutenant.
- You've lived here all along?
- Yes...
Did you see the restaurant?
I have a surprise for you!
Look who landed here!
Who?
Lo Russo!
Hell! Lieutenant!
Life wasn't so good in Italy.
They didn't let us change anything.
So?
So I told them...
"You win... "
"but don't consider me
your accomplice. "
That's what I told them.
And so I came here.
And you? What will you do now?
I'll give you a hand...
DEDICATED TO ALL THOSE
ARE RUNNING AWAY
