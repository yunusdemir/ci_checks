13. October 2008
Received by Filmkameratene A/S -
- an anonymous shipment with two
hard drives containing 283 minutes of footage.
This is a rough cut of the material...
All is shown chronologically,
and the images have not been manipulated.
For over a year
a team of investigators studied-
- whether the material was real or not.
The conclusion was that it is genuine.
It's clear.
Turn on the radio.
- Johanna, do you have audio?
- Yes.
It doesn't work.
Late yesterday evening
bear tracks were found in Volda.
A team of bear hunters arrived early today
in order to shoot the bear.
The leader of the hunters
tells the following to the BBC:
This is a stray bear
that we should kill pretty quickly.
But our real concern is
a poacher, who has followed us here.
Only a select few are
allowed to hunt bears.
I know absolutely all the
bear hunters in Norway.
The guy in the Land Rover
is certainly not a bear hunter.
If he shoots at the bear,
he does it illegally.
- Have you seen him?
- We see him everywhere.
If I see him again,
there will be consequences.
I think it's
a common poacher.
- What would you say to him?
- That he should lay his cards on the table.
Now!
- There are cars coming from every direction.
- We're going to lose him!
Ready?
We only know that his name is Hans.
We do not have his last name.
I think you need to be more serious.
What is he doing in Volda?
Who is this man?
- Is there sound?
- You haven't plugged it in.
You don't get an interview
with a damn poacher.
I don't think it's funny
when you ridicule him.
That's terrific.
Thank You. Bye.
Thomas, he says he's seen the guy
and he lives at the trailer park!
I can't say that I know him,
but he lives here.
He lives there.
Shall I show you?
I don't know what it is that stinks,
but it stinks something horrible.
- What's this for?
- I don't know what it is..
Thyme?
He drives off and is gone
until the sun comes up.
- He's out all night?
- Yes. Always.
- Are you up for this?
- Yes.
We don't know when he coming,
if he's even going to.
- There he is!
- The camera's running. Ask him straight out.
Good morning. My name is Thomas.
We are from the college in Volda.
May we ask you a couple of questions?
Go away.
Maybe we can come back a bit later...
- Are you recording anything?
- Hush, I hear something.
Yes, I'm rolling now.
I expect to find it tonight.
Ok. That's Fine. Bye.
- He isn't here.
- He was right in front of us!
Yes, but ...
- Damn!
- Well done, Thomas.
- Are you filming? Can you see anything?
- Yes.
There's some kind of hairy stuff
hanging from the ceiling.
And there's a shotgun there.
We are heading to a place where
a bear was found shot this morning.
Could it be him who shot the bear?
Where this came from,
Heaven knows.
I've checked with all of the
registered bear hunters.
None of them shot this bear.
All bear hunting
is strictly regulated by the State.
So there is going to be a hell of a fuss
when a bear is killed this way.
Come here.
These tracks here do not
match with the bear's.
I think someone brought the bear
here and positioned it like this.
- It is quite strange.
- Totally agree.
You are from the Wildlife Advisory Board, right?
Finn Haugan?
The hunters say they don't
think it's bear tracks.
That's ridiculous.
What kind of tracks would they be then?
It's a bear with
bear tracks leading to it.
- Why do you think they doubt it?
- Ask them. It's crazy.
We've waited a few hours for Hans now.
It seems like something's brewing.
We are pretty confident that
he is going somewhere.
Go!
It appears that he's
going on the ferry.
How long do you think we
should keep this up?
Can you see what it is?
He's carrying a car tire.
- What's he doing?
- He disappeared down the hill.
Three, two, one and ...
Sogn og Fjordane!
Okay, he's standing over there.
Just stay hidden.
We met briefly before.
- Really?
- Thomas from the University of Volda.
- Is it ...
- So are you following me?
No. We just want to ask
you a few questions.
No.
Are you ...
What were you really doing in Volda?
Was it you who shot the bear?
Stay away from me!
Cut that out. Leave me alone!
First, we get what we need.
Then we can go back.
It will be insanely good if we can
get the guy to answer the questions.
We have tried, many times.
Do you think Michael Moore
gave up after his first attempt?
Left arm or right foot?
Kicking foot and ...
Now we have been
here all afternoon.
He's still in his car.
I guess he's sleeping.
We are patiently waiting for
something to happen.
Are you kidding me?
Okay.
I have to take the audio equipment with us.
What is this?
"No Trespassing.
Blasting in progress."
Did you see that?
Was it a road?
Did you?
Terrible roads.
You go first in cade there's
a group of inbred pig farmers.
- I'm not...
- Stop whining.
- I should probably give my opinion here.
- Should we go back?
- We can drop the whole thing.
- No!
Wait!
See here.
I don't think he's in the car.
- So we know that he's here.
- But what is he doing?
Here's a path.
- I hear something far away.
- What is it?
Troll!
Thomas!
Hurry!
The car's right here!
- What?
- I was bitten!
- Are you okay?
- It stings.
- You heard him yell "troll"?
- Shut up.
You need more.
- What can I do?
- Get the dressing from the first aid kit.
- Not...
- We have to lift it up a little here.
Damnit.  You look messed up, Thomas.
- What are you doing?
- Tetanus.
You yelled something in the woods,
didn't you?
- You heard it, Johanna.
- What's the slime here?
What did he say?
- More?
- Yes.
Can we get a lift down to the car?
It isn't a good idea
to follow me.
Did you yell "troll" back there?
- Is this your car?
- What the hell is this?
- What happened?
- It's our car!
Someone smashed the car.
It's totally wrecked.
Look here, Thomas.
- Do you understand any of this?
- Yes, I have some idea.
It's not a bear that
did this here..
What do you think happened?
- What ...
- Ask whether it is a troll.
If you know what happened
to the car, say so!
- You shouted "troll" in the woods.
- Drop it now!
What the hell are you looking for?
Will you film me if I
say that there are trolls?
- Is it funny?
- No, but you do not think there are ...
Now I drive.  If you are going to
ride along, you must come now.
What do we do?
Do you have any bags?
Just so we understand you correctly:
You actually believe that there are trolls?
Do you think it was
a bear that bit you?
Whats happening?
Why did we stop?
Thanks for letting us ride with you.
We would like to see what
you are doing and film it.
Yes, we really would like to.
You can film when I kill the one who
attacked you, on one condition:
You must do exactly as I say,
no matter what I say. Okay?
Yes.
I feel like I'm bleeding everywhere.
- Can I take a look at the wound?
- It looks a little bit cool.
- You are sick in the head.
- I mean it.
- Why did you call them?
- To say that we're here.
He isn't so dangerous.
He's just weird.
Remember that he's running the show,
and we do as he says.
So we get what we need.
Is there anyone here who
believes in God or Jesus?
No, none of us.
Don't look at me.
Seriously?
Because they smell Christian blood?
Is it okay?
Go out and close the gate
and hang up the sign in the middle.
- Is that a landmine you have there?
- Yes, but it is not armed.
I'm sitting on a landmine?
Are you crazy?
Is there anyone who won't
go into the woods with us?
Someone who has changed his mind?
Who is afraid of trolls?
- No.
- No? Good.
There is a creek there. Take your clothes
off and wash yourself thoroughly.
- Especially underarms and groin.
- No!
- Why?
- To remove all of your body odor.
Then rub your entire body with this.
Your clothes as well.
- What is it?
- Trollstink.
- Put it on your whole body.
- Are you messing with me? It stinks!
You must smell like a troll
or else they will smell you and run away.
For Satan!
- No, I say!
- It doesn't bother me, Thomas.
No, I said!
You should do
exactly as I say.
If you don't do it,
I will go up alone and you can stay here.
Do you understand?
Are you ready?
Have you rubbed yourself?
You look very cute.
Flashlights for you.
- What is it?
- A weapon, really.
Hans?
How do you use this weapon?
It shoots out a strong burst
of ultraviolet light.
UVB rays.
Just like the sun or a tanning bed.
Don't you know anything, Thomas?
They turn to stone in sunlight.
- Yes. Or they explode.
- Didn't you read anything?
I heard the fairy tales when I was
little, but ... Did you know, Kalle?
What if the troll wants to
have an eating match?
An eating match?
Asbjornsen and Moe's stories were
not entirely correct in reality.
I think it matches up fairly well.
- Troll Piss.
- My God!
It smells quite pungent.
I'm chasing a raglefant.
There is piss everywhere up here.
Seems like he has been chased out
of his territory. He marked it though.
He doesn't seem well.
I would like to find out what's wrong.
A blood sample from the troll?
I don't have any equipment or anything.
You too. Bye.
I need help finding
out what's wrong.
Blood test, it ...
It will be difficult.
Who were you talking to?
A veterinarian.
A veterinarian!
If you wait here, I'll try to
track down the troll and chase it.
Yeah.
Was this what you imagined?
It may take a little time.
It's a shame for him if
he really believe in trolls.
Maybe he was filming us.
- That must have certainly been it.
- He's sitting and laughing at us somewhere.
We are so stupid that
we sit up here and ...
Cranberries?
- In the woods?
- Yes, without food and drink.
- Great!
- What is it?
It's like a night-vision thing.
Listen!
It's just the guy that...
in one week
was bitten by a bear.
- It's a better story.
- You look pretty good.
- So I think I chose it.
- Being bitten by a bear?
Can you feel it?
There are some very strange sounds here.
What is it?
Seriously.
There's something going on.
What's happening?
This is just a fucking joke.
It's a damn Tusseladd!
Get away!
Run, dammit!
Hurry!
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
Where did it go?
Did you seen where it went?
Get behind the car!
No!
- Give me the camera!
- No!
Where's Johanna?
Thomas!
Kalle!
- Johanna!
- It was real!
I said it!
I knew it!
They exist!
- Say something.
- This rocks!
We ran through the entire forest ...
Why the hell did you say
that you weren't Christians?
You didn't know that trolls sniffed?
One of you believes in God.
I do not believe in God.
I was in the YMCA.
But it was my parents
who told me to do it.
I do not believe in God.
Seriously.
- It's not her.
- What do you mean?
Stop this nonsense! It's some
genetically modified bastard creation.
- It is a troll.
- No, it's not!
Why is there no one
who knows about all of this?
Because someone wants it
to be kept a secret.
The State?
Keeping a State secret?
Do you work for the State?
- Why would you show us this stuff now?
- It's a fucking shitty job.
The Work Authority has said some things
they shouldn't have. I don't get nights in.
No overtime and shitty pay.
Maybe it's time for a
change in troll management.
- If you manage to get this on TV ...
- I think we're going to.
Come on.
If you would like to see more
of these creatures, it's ok with me.
I would move away if I were you.
Damn!
The stone is crushed and given
to anyone who has a hole to fill.
What the hell is that?
- Who's coming?
- I don't know.
Hey, hey.
The guy we were filming ...
What are you doing, Hans?
Did these people film you?
They wanted to see trolls,
so I showed them some.
We have interviewed him before.
Aren't you from the Game Board?
It was an exceptionally bad idea.
Turn off the camera.
I have enough problems.
The valley is littered
with dead cows.
We can not talk about this while
they film. Turn off the camera. Now!
- Put it down.
- We are allowed to film here.
- Are you starting to lose it?
- I have full control.
As soon as a scapegoat in place,
I'll take care of the rest.
Hi Finn.
How are you?
Going good?
Excellent?
I've driven a long way.
Wait.
Are you filming?
Really good!
Very fresh!
- It isn't a Scandinavian bear.
- No, it's from Croatia!
It is very similar to the
Scandinavian bear. No problem, Finn!
Hello!
It is very fresh.
We need to take a break. My back!
Put it over there.
Very good.
It's very good.
35.000...
Bad bear, bad price.
Raglefanten is still in the woods.
Then go find it!
A pair of German tourists
disappeared in the night.
- We expect there will be a couple more.
- It's not my problem.
If you think you that you
get to keep the footage ... No Way!
Han is the best at finding bears.
This bear is from the zoo.
Zoo, you know.
- Why does Finn buy the bears?
- No idea!
In Poland we ask not, we do.
Why problem make when you no
problem have you don't want to make?
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye.
It says, "Piot Painting Service."
What is your job exactly?
My job is to kill all the trolls
who break out of their territories ...
... and approach people.
- How often do they break out?
Very rarely, but now we
have a special situation.
Many trolls have broken out
and are wandering around the area.
Finn is a ... bureaucrat.
He directs the TST.
His role is primarily to prevent -
- people from finding out about
the trolls in the forest.
In a way, you are probably
some of Norway's greatest heroes.
No, you're wrong.
What I do is not heroic.
It's dirty, hard work.
How is it possible that
nobody knows about this?
Let's drive to Oslo, to sell these
recordings to the BBC, and get lots of money.
That isn't relevant right now.
Now we just follow him.
Finn is angry.
- What should we do now?
- It's time for breakfast.
- You should eat something.
- I'm not that hungry.
I'm a little... tired.
How many types of trolls are there?
There are two main groups:
mountain trolls and forest trolls.
The subgroups are raglefant,
tusseladd, rimtusse ...
Dovregubben.
Harding is the type on the West Coast.
But the troll we saw ...
Do they all have three heads?
No, they're all different.
They develop heads
through their life cycle.
They are not born with three heads.
Usually they are born with one head,
and the others grow later.
They only have eyes on the middle head.
It's their original one.
The other heads are not
really minds, but formations -
- To simulate heads and
scare other trolls.
Or impress female trolls.
What is that form?
- What is the TST?
- Troll Security Team
Every time we harvest a troll,
we have to fill this out.
Where we kill it, its sex
and whether it exploded or was calcified.
In Asbjornsen and Moe fables,
the trolls have clothes -
- and talk like humans.
- They are like people.
- You can forget those stories.
Trolls are animals. Predators.
They eat, shit, mate with
and devour everything around them.
- How long do they live?
- 1000, 1200 years.
- How intelligent are they?
- Not smart at all. They're stupid.
They manage to find food, but when
you eat rocks, it isn't hard to survive.
I saw one who tried
to eat its own tail.
He had his head between his legs
and tried to grab his tail.
When he had swallowed almost
the entire thing-
- he toppled over and rolled down
the hill like a wheel.
- I was in the Navy.
- Was that how you got the job?
No, they were looking for
someone who could ...
- So you're the only one in Norway?
- Yes.
Shall we go?
- They eat all kinds of crap.
- They eat people?
- You can try to offer yourself of course.
- No, but they have been eating people?
- Are those troll tails?
- Yes.  Some are parts and some are whole.
- Why?
- So it smells like troll.
Why does it need to smell like troll?
I must be able to get close to
the trolls without them noticing me.
- A tanning bed?
- Yes.
- It can give you skin cancer.
- I use sunscreen.
I have a little trouble
sleeping at night.
- Is that what we smeared ourselves with?
- Yes.
- What is it?
- Concentrated troll smell.
A mixture of everything bad
that can be squeezed out of a troll.
We must find raglefanten before
he eats through every house in the area.
The German tourists were found north
of Kulp Mountain, killed by a bear.
Finn Haugan from the Wildlife Board
will examine whether it was the same ...
Do you know where the troll might be?
Do you have any clues?
No.
What are you looking for?
Landslides,
fallen trees and such.
Do you see anything?
- Is it like that? Only with a backpack.
- Yes.
Maybe you should check it?
- Is it bad?
- It goes up and down.
- Is it safe here?
- They are only out at night.
Kalle, we can not ...
It is hasn't left, but the bait is gone.
Probably taken by small trolls.
Concrete and charcoal
is an unbeatable combination.
- Do it now!
- Now?
Now, Hans has found traces of
what he thinks is raglefanten...
Hans has found traces of
what he thinks is raglefanten.
And there is a sheep carcass nearby.
He thinks that there is some
correlation between these two things.
Hurry!
Global warming has caused
certain things to happen -
- with our fauna, our flora,
with wildlife ...
The tracks you see here in the area -
- are from a Russian bear,
who has come through Finland and Sweden.
The bear stores his food
under the bridge here.
- Isn't that strange behavior?
- Not for a Russian bear.
They are accustomed to long, harsh winters.
So they hoard like squirrels.
Isn't there something strange
about the bear tracks?
There's the outer toe, so it's the
left foot. And then you have the right foot here.
Has the bear been like that, or?
You have seen bear tracks before, right?
Hey, what about the tracks?
He has stripped the bark of the tree.
Typical raglefant.
He'll be back tonight.
I have something to lure him with.
- And then you'll kill him?
- Yes.
But first I must take the blood test.
Is this a syringe?
That's absolutely terrible!
It's animal abuse.
It isn't cruelty.
It's just bait.
It's too far away.
Can't we go further?
No, I'm zoomed in.
We can see it very well.
Odd working hours.
We have been here forever.
It isn't even certain that troll is coming.
- We are fine here. We're doing fine.
- But we can see much better from there.
Let's go.
It's here.
Can you hear it?
Run!
Damn, I hate it here!
Now you have to keep a good distance.
I'll pour a little Christian blood out.
Pull back!
Damn!
Kalle! Thomas!
Move! Move!
Are you okay?
You ...
Are you okay?
Help him up.
- Come on, Hans.
- Are you okay?
Be careful with the red button.
Give me the syringe.
Stay up there.
So we know that trolls also explode.
- How are you?
- Yes please.
Not so bad.
Just a little stiff.
A little stiff?
This is so sick!
At least I got the blood test.
I'll be there in half an hour, I think.
That's fine. Goodbye.
You look like a newborn!
These are some young filmmakers.
They will ask you some questions.
- Is that blood?
- Yes.
- A bit of a fuss to get the sample.
- I can see that.
Look at you guys!
- Gladly!
- There is a toilet in there.
- What do you see?
- There are too few red blood cells.
It may take me a few days.
Could we get an interview?
If you could just stand ...
If you sit there.
- What should I tell?
- Tell it all.
- We are not allowed to ...
- I take responsibility.
The main problem for the trolls
is that they can not convert vitamin D -
- From sunlight to calcium,
like we can.
When they are exposed to bright sunlight,
their body reacts.
The stomach swells.
Gas pushes out into the intestines
and blood vessels. It is unbearable.
- And then they explode?
- Yes.
- But some trolls calcified?
- Yes, the older trolls calcified.
Their veins are too narrow, so the
expansion occurs inside of their bones.
It takes a few seconds, then they
turn into limestone and become quite stiff.
I wish they did not have to
experience that pain.
It is traumatic, but it only takes
a few seconds before they become stiff.
We'd probably give them a shot.
- I'll have the answer in a few days
- And then you'll call me?
- Have a good time.
- You too.
- Shall we go?
- Yes.
- Why do you have so many local newspapers?
- I'm gathering information.
- About what?
- About trolls.
Accidents and things that have
happened that trolls are often behind.
- I have the folders back there.
- May I see?
"End of the Road."
People will always find
natural explanations.
But if you know what to look for,
it is easy to see that there are trolls.
The bridge is smashed in half.
He waded up the fjord and knocked
through the concrete with his head.
There are trolls that large?
Yes, giant ones can become that large.
I'm the only one who has seen them though.
There is mountain troll territory
in Finnmarksvidden.
And then there's one
on the Hardangervidda.
Jotunheimen, three.
And then there Dovre.
Now we have to find where the problem lies.
Jotunheimen is closest.
We are heading to the first terrirtory
with Hans in command.
We are driving in a circle
around the territory now.
The territory stops here,
and since the tire is still intact -
- Hans says that there haven't been
trolls outside the territory.
Had they been here,
there would be damage to the tire.
Smile!
There.
Take the shot...
Trolls love to chew
on old tires.
Here, one tried to kick it in,
but he did not make a hole in the crate.
- How many trolls exist?
- It is impossible to say.
Do you have any idea?
Gestation time is like 10-15 years
and they usually have only one child.
- Are they mammals?
- Yes.
Let's see ...
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
It does look nice.
The stones are where they were before.
Clearly this is a battlefield.
Mountain trolls and forest trolls
fought here.
They threw the stones at each other.
But it's been a while since
there has been any activity here.
He will pay back.
Isn't that what they say?
Do you remember the drawing of the avjotnen?
They live here in Jotunheimen.
- Where?
- Inside the mountain.
- Where are we going?
- Just stay here.
I've eaten an entire loaf of bread.
Finn is incredibly stubborn.
He claims that all the escaped
trolls came from Dovre.
Just because he didn't see any
trolls on the satellite image.
But trolls are not visible on
satellite images. It proves nothing!
We are getting to the
bottom of this, guys.
We are going to a farm that
was in the local news.
Hans believes that it
was troll related.
Wow, check that out!
Did you get a shot of that?
- What happened here?
- It was a tornado.
- Were you here when it happened?
- No.
Do you see how the trees are here?
Had it been a straight line wind,
they would have fallen in one direction.
Who was here and showed you the map?
They didn't show any identification.
But they had some fine weather
maps and satellite maps of the area.
And we could see something
that looked like tornados.
There are traces of at least three
trolls here who have continued north.
The fact that people don't notice
these big beasts that smash across the earth!
We'll come back tonight,
take a trip into the woods.
I'm starting to get tired.
- I don't like this.
- We stick together.
Seriously, Kalle.
We have to go now.
What do you think we should do?
There are tracks in there.
There are traces of them.
They've been here.
- We can't stand here alone.
- This way!
An abandoned mine.
- They have been here.
- I will not fucking go in there!
There are no trolls now.
Come on.
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.
No, there's no one home.
I must get some troll stink.
- Here.
- I'll take the camera.
Is it rolling?
It's not just one troll
that lives here.
It's a whole bunch.
A damn hive.
- We can go.
- Come on! Let's get out!
Let's go.
Come on!
Someone's coming!
Get back!
Can we go?
Go back further!
Quick! Inside!
Turn off the lights!
I have to get out of here.
- Do you have more of the troll stink?
- No, not here.
Try to relax.
Breathe easy.
Relax.
- What's stressing you out?
- I'm a Christian!
- We're going to die!
- Damn!
Don't fucking start to sweat!
Dear God ...
Shut up!
Run!
Sun!
It still works.
There are more back there.
I'll have to get them later.
He could have said that
he was a Christian.
I must find out why
the beasts ran away.
I can drive you to the camp site
if you want to.
- What are you doing in my car?
- Looking after the footage.
Did you root around in my trailer?
- Are you filming now?
- No.
- It's chaos up there.
- Shouldn't you be there then?
I don't go into that territory.
I don't.
- Turn off the camera.
- It isn't on.
Why shouldn't people
know about this?
- What is your job anyway?
- It's confidential information.
Why shouldn't people be told what
is going on? People are dieing after all!
Why is this secret?
- People have a right to know.
- No.
- Don't touch the camera.
- This is not your business.
It is my business!
- Get out!
- This isn't over.
I have to go back and check what happened.
If you want to come, it's okay.
- Yes, we do.
- Are you ready for it?
- Yes.
- We'll continue the filming.
We'll find a new camera.
Here comes the new cameraman.
- Malica.
- Thomas.
So you aren't Christian?
- You do not believe in Jesus or God?
- I'm Muslim.
That's good.
Muslim, is that okay?
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.
- It should be fine.
- Shall we shoot the musk oxen?
No, we won't.
- So, off we go.
- Yes, we might as well.
Let's get underway.
- Who have you worked for before?
- I've Worked for NRK and the BBC.
-I have filmed lions in Tanzania.
- Lions, yes.
This is the worst I've ever seen.
Damn.
They've broken every tree
for miles around.
A giant has probably
been through here.
A giant of 50-100 meters,
which has scared the Dovretrolden away.
A giant in the long run
isn't any good.
Honestly.
All of you believe in trolls?
Do you think it's squirrels
that have been doing this?
They had it good in the territory, so...
but the TST put a lid on everything.
They may look like
ordinary power lines -
- But they're energized fences
that keep the trolls in place.
I do not understand how
they got through here.
There is a team of technicians
in Dombas and working power generators.
-Do they know about the trolls?
-No, no.
Have you found any error
in the high-voltage in Dovre?
Errors you say?
If you want to hang up you coats...
Over here.
Several hundred feet of
high voltage cable, bang, straight
into the ground. 300,000 volts.
- When did this happen?
- Three weeks ago.
- Do you know how it happened?
- No one knows.
The cable is hurricane proof and
it fell down. No, we have no idea how.
- Is this a school assignment?
- Yes. University of Volda.
- Are you a teacher?
- No.
Where is the high voltage wire?
It goes here -
- and then north in a loop
down here and such.
- Then they go in circles?
- Yes, they go in circles.
Isn't that a bit weird?
Yes, a little, maybe.
- Yes, it's weird.
- The flow goes nowhere.
Yes, it goes around.
And it's in a scenic area.
If a giant has broken through the
high voltage fence, something is wrong.
I can drive up to Dovre and
try to find the beast.
Up there, the territorial
border begins.
It's a damn treck to
set up new towers.
But only protestors
and farmers bitch and moan.
I think they're fine.
They were put out so the trolls
would have access to food.
It goes around the entire territory.
We've been in this area.
And here.
We haven't seen evidence of trolls.
I think that we should
try this area.
There's a TST building
where we can wait.
Some researchers believe that
this has natural explanations ...
They've measured over 1000 aftershocks ...
Now we're in the territory.
I got the impression that you
normally wouldn't go into the territory.
Is there any particular reason?
It was a mountain troll
territory up in Strynefjell.
In the seventies, they
decided to build tunnels -
- Right where it was teeming
with mountain trolls.
The TST and I tried to protest,
but it was useless.
Then there was my job to go into the
territory and destroy all the trolls.
All there were.
Pregnant females.
Children.
Absolute newborns who could
not even walk yet.
It was a bloody massacre.
Hans' whole life has focused
exclusively on trolls.
For him, every day was
a battle with trolls.
He is, in many ways,
a hero here in Norway.
What had we done without him?
Therefore, it is important
that we make this film.
Shoulder.
Are you okay?
I'll be back in an hour.
Should we follow?
He is inordinately large,
but I must try.
It sounds as if it has
all clicked for him.
So it may be a little difficult.
Your phone's ringing, Hans.
- Where is it?
- It's on the seat.
It's Thomas.
He's a little busy at the moment.
Can I ...
Rabies?
- The Raglefanten had rabies.
- May I speak with Hilde?
Hi Hilda.
Are you sure?
Now I'm starting to understand.
Okay.
Yes, you too.
Goodbye.
It wouldn't surprise me if every one
that we met was infected.
He has spread the disease around
to both Raglefantene and Dovregubben.
- And even you Thomas.
- Me?
I do not have rabies.
Hello!
Dogs have rabies.
If you have rabies,
you need to go to the hospital.
If you think that he has rabies,
he must go to the hospital!
I do not have rabies.
You may not know that I have rabies!
Then we have to get to a hospital right away!
- Now comes the damn animals.
- I will damn it!
- We can't be here.
- Look!
Is it coming here?
Go out? Are you mad?
He's leaving!
Stand still!
I'll try to lure him over here.
What a friend we have in Jesus ...
What's he doing?
What's he doing?
The damned flash
ran out of power.
Definitely rabies.
Can we drive to the hospital now?
- I should probably give some more flashes.
- What are you talking about?
But first I have to wear him down.
He's getting closer!
- We're running from him!
- That's good.
- There's a person!
- Stop, Hans!
- Get in!
- Hurry up, dammit!
Go!
Go!
- Where are you going?
- Stay here.
- Hans!
- Get back!
Damn!
Get in the car!
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a seismologist.
It's right in front of us.
Watch out!
Is it on now?
Hans, what are you doing?
I have to give him the coup de grace.
- With that there?
- Yes.
I hope that I've got
the shots I need.
Follow the road.
Then you will come to E6.
I can't hear anything!
Malica...
Don't make fun of me.
There are trolls on these drives.
Here's the footage.
I'm bleeding?
What did you say?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
Look! Look there!
Isn't that Finn and the others?
Damn, it is Finn.
Camera. Give me the camera!
Thomas, what are you doing?
Here ends the recording.
Nothing was found in the mine,
and the filmmakers vanished without a trace.
We urge anyone
who has information -
- to contact Filmkameratene A/S
or the nearest police station.
It has not been possible to obtain
confirmation of TST's existence.
An indirect confirmation came, however -
- From Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg
in Oslo on 25 June 2010.
The press did not understand the point.
We want to minimize interference
in the Norwegian countryside.
He says power lines are fine.
I think not.
But in Norway, we have the power -
- but against power lines.
And it doesn't last.
Norway has trolls, so it
will need more power lines.
- And so it is.
- We'll wrap here!
