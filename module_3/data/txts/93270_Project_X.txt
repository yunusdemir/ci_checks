What up, my lovely females! This is
your boy, Costa, your host for the evening.
Behind me is Thomas Kub's house.
Today is Thomas Kub's birthday.
And this is Project X, yo.
[SINGING]
Hey, we want some pussy
[HUMMING]
Hey, we want some pussy
Birthday cake. Mm.
- Dax, my dick is gonna get so wet tonight.
- Excuse me.
Shit. Um, Mrs. Kub,
I thought you guys left already.
- So, what's getting wet tonight?
- Uh...
Nothing. I'm sorry about that, Mrs. Kub.
- Who's your friend?
- Don't worry about him.
We're shooting this birthday movie
for Thomas.
Like this day-in-the-life type thing.
No big deal.
He's still in the shower.
See you later.
[WHISPERING]
Fuck me, that was close.
Dax.
[SHOWER RUNNING]
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
Happy birthday, motherfucker!
Whoa, shit! What the fuck, dude?
COSTA: What the fuck?
- I'm jerking off to your mom.
COSTA: So, dude, it's your last day
of being a loser. How does it feel?
THOMAS:
You're such a dick, Costa.
Shit never gets old.
[WIZ KHALIFA'S "WHEN I'M GONE"
PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
COSTA [SINGING]:
Wait for another day
What's up, Dax?
How'd they rope you into this?
He's one of J.B.'s guys from Gay-V Club.
He's a fucking weirdo, I know,
but he's a solid shooter.
And he's gonna make us look pimp,
and you fucking better.
DAD:
Thomas, get down here!
Oh, shit. Let's go.
[MUSIC STOPS]
COSTA:
You said your parents would be gone by 7.
I don't wanna go talk to your fucking dad.
DAD: No food in the living room. Your mother
will kill me and I'll have to kill you.
- Here's 40 bucks for pizza, okay?
THOMAS: Oh, cool.
DAD: You guys can have that.
Knock yourself out.
Back door or turn the alarm system off.
And look, Thomas, I'm not an idiot.
I know you're gonna have friends over.
- Dad, what do you think is gonna happen?
- Mr. Kub, honestly, we have no...
Mm-mm. I'm sorry. Who are you?
THOMAS: This is Dax.
DAD: What is this?
THOMAS: He's shooting a movie
for my birthday, you know, a little present.
DAD: Didn't know you had Goth friends.
THOMAS: He's just a friend from school.
DAD:
Four or five friends, tops.
I'm just asking that you please
respect my house, okay?
THOMAS:
All right, fine.
DAD:
So leave the gate open for the gardener.
And I know I don't need to tell you,
but my car is off limits.
- Yeah, Dad, I know.
- Good. Okay.
The pool heater, don't touch it.
And also, guys,
do not go in my office, right?
I have three projects I'm working on.
I don't want anybody in there, clear?
- Get out, out, out.
THOMAS: Dad...
Nothing goes in here, right?
Where's your mom?
I'm gonna get the bags.
DAD:
What's going on? What's the matter?
- I'm just worried.
- About what?
I don't know.
Thomas, leaving him alone all weekend.
Oh, please, stop it. Come on, honey.
He's 17 years old.
That's what I'm worried about.
Let's be realistic here, okay?
This is Thomas we're talking about.
He's not exactly Mr. Popular.
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'm just saying that he's not that type of kid.
He's got a couple of friends. They're gonna
hang out, but they're not gonna do anything.
He's a sweet kid, but...
...he's a loser.
ALL [SINGING]:
Happy birthday to you
[PARENTS APPLAUDING]
DAD: Happy birthday, Thomas.
- Whoo! Yay!
DAD:
All right, honey, car is here.
- Boys, gotta get to school.
THOMAS: Cool.
Hold on. We gotta give Thomas
his birthday present.
How cool is it that Thomas
was born on your anniversary?
What a great anniversary gift, a baby.
MOM: Happy birthday, sweetie.
THOMAS: Ahh.
- Mom's minivan? Nice.
DAD: Yeah.
It's just for school and back.
That's it, right?
- Yes. Thank you so much.
- Cool, right? You have a car now.
THOMAS: I know.
- Okay.
And, Milo, you take good care of Thomas,
okay? Momma's gonna miss you.
- Okay, bye.
- All right, see you guys.
Every one of my phone calls
gets answered, right?
- Yeah, I know.
- Every one. Okay.
- All right, have fun.
COSTA: Bye.
THOMAS:
Happy anniversary.
Get off me, you little faggot dog.
- Yeah!
- It's on, motherfuckers!
- Whoo!
THOMAS: Dude, chill out. Goddamn.
COSTA: It was really cool of your mom and dad
to clean it out and wash it for you.
It's a free car.
I'm not about to complain about a free car.
It's not even a car. It's a fucking minivan.
We can't even roll in this.
Dude, too bad your dad didn't give you
the Benz. That'd have been sick.
You know what, you're right, Costa.
Let's just take your car.
- Oh, you don't have one.
- Good fucking joke, good fucking joke.
COSTA:
So, dog, you ready for tonight?
THOMAS: I actually wanna talk to you
about that, you know, before we jump into it.
COSTA: I knew it. You're bitching out.
THOMAS: What?
What? Dude, I'm not bitching out.
Thomas is bitching out
like the little bitch that he is.
THOMAS: Fuck you.
- Oh, my God.
[THOMAS LAUGHING]
- Oh, shit.
- We need this party. You need this party.
THOMAS: I'm just nervous.
What if nobody shows up? What if it sucks?
COSTA: That's not an option.
People will show up.
Look at J.B. He's like a little fat
Rain Man, texting away.
[HORN HONKS]
THOMAS: Dude, stop.
COSTA: You're telling me he doesn't need this?
Holy shit, dude. Your parents gave
you the minivan? That's awesome!
- Yeah.
- Hey, Costa. Hey, Dax.
BRENDAN:
That isn't happening. That's not real.
THOMAS: Uh, excuse me...
GIRL: Sorry.
Hey, can I get to my locker right there?
Dude, why are you staring at my dick?
[ALL LAUGHING]
I wasn't. My locker's there.
Can I get to it?
- Whatever, you fucking weirdo.
COSTA: Dude, just let it go. Just come on.
- Hey, that's a sweet minivan, soccer mom.
- See? See what I told you?
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
BOY: Is it true what I heard about you
at Zam's party?
You got a blowjob from his mom?
That party was so sick.
Everyone got laid.
Wheelchair Robert even got a handjob.
BOY: Nice.
- Are you kidding me?
Why the fuck weren't we
at that party, man?
So we missed a party, dude. Big deal.
It is a big deal. We miss every party.
I mean, did you hear that guy?
Wheelchair Robert got beat off.
I wanna show you something.
See this? Check this out.
That's Stasia. Gorgeous, right?
That's my girl back in Queens.
We could be crushing this kind of ass,
but we need a game changer.
I mean, no one even knows who we are.
If we want to be bigtime players,
we need to make a bigtime play.
You feel me?
J.B., what the fuck, man?
Why do you have a boner?
- I don't, it's just my underwear sitting funny.
- Cover up.
COSTA:
That's absolutely disgusting.
THOMAS: It's easy to talk shit when
the party's not even at your house.
COSTA: Dude, please don't back out.
This party is gonna change everything for us.
Okay. Well, I mean,
I'm the one taking the whole risk.
All you do is show up and drink.
You think we'd ditch you
if something went wrong?
- I'm fucking offended, man.
- Yeah, me too.
The idea behind tonight is
to get these bitches...
...to recognize us as large-scale ballers.
Back in Queens,
I had hoes blowing me on the reg.
- I started hanging out with you two. Zero!
- I just don't really see the point anymore.
COSTA: How do you not see the point?
There's the point. There's the point.
THOMAS:
Okay.
COSTA: There's two more fucking points
right there! It's all around you.
THOMAS:
Dude, I get it.
If you fuck this up, I will stab you.
I'm not kidding.
- Okay, no more than 20 people.
- Twenty people?
- All right, 30 people.
- Thirty people?
- To make sure my house doesn't get fucked.
J. B: Thirty people won't change anything for us.
All right, look, okay, 50 people,
absolute max.
Fine, 50 people, absolute max.
You know, just big enough to be cool.
MAN [ON TV]: Sand, an adversary in many ways
more dangerous than those carrying weapons.
Mass marketing, handled.
[CELL PHONES VIBRATING]
- Shh.
COSTA: Yeah, of course, Jack. Anything.
And if you guys get there
before we get there...
...you can just get in the backyard
and set up...
...and do what you gotta do.
- Dax, Dax. Go film over the top.
COSTA:
Okay. Really, we appreciate that.
Oh, uh... I have to call you back, sir.
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Get the fuck out of here!
THOMAS: What the fuck are you doing?
- Guys. Hey, guys, what the fuck?
[J.B. & THOMAS LAUGHING]
COSTA:
Are you fucking with me right now?
J. B: Look.
COSTA: That was a business call for your party.
THOMAS:
Who takes a shit and makes a business call?
COSTA: Are you kidding?
THOMAS: Now you can shit in peace.
COSTA: Come on, dude. I can't see a thing.
It's dark as fuck in here.
[COACH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
COSTA:
Dax, come on. Let's get closer.
GIRL: Heh, heh.
THOMAS: It should be pretty cool, I think.
Basically chill.
I'm letting Costa plan most of it.
Oh, that sounds like a really
brilliant idea.
No, he's doing a good job. He's getting,
like, a bunch of booze and then...
...I think, like, a DJ.
- A DJ. Super chill.
THOMAS: Ha.
Guess what Mama Kub
and Papa Kub got for...
- Baby Kub?
...Baby Kub for his birthday.
- What?
- The Kub Mobile.
- They gave you the minivan?
- For my birthday, yes.
Your parents give the worst gifts ever.
- Where's your present?
- You serious?
You haven't gotten me a present
in 10 years.
So?
But since I am a better friend than you,
I did get you something.
- Oh.
- I'll bring it tonight. Hey, I have to go run.
- Happy birthday, loser.
- Ow.
- Don't trip.
KIRBY: Ow!
THOMAS: Oh, shit!
KIRBY: I'm okay! Heh.
COSTA: Thomas, suck my cock.
THOMAS: What?
- "Mama Kub and Papa Kub"? Jesus.
- Yeah, those are my parents, asshole.
THOMAS:
Damn, she's so fucking hot, dude.
- Think she'll come tonight?
COSTA: I'm not inviting her. You do this one.
J. B: Alexis won't come.
She fucks college dudes.
[CELL PHONE VIBRATING]
"Lamel"? What? I don't know any Lamel.
COSTA:
No, he's cool.
Guys, the last thing I want in my house
is a bunch of randoms.
Wrong. Last thing you want
is nobody at your fucking house.
The more word gets around, the more likely
these chicks will show up at our party.
Watch and learn how
Captain Big Dick does it.
[GIRLS CHATTERING]
Hey, girls. Just remember,
wear something tight.
What's up, sisters?
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.
Come get a piece of this white chocolate.
DAX: Are you gonna be going to
Thomas's birthday party tonight?
- Thomas? Who's that?
- Who's Thomas?
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
That thing that dick in
the sweater vest was telling us about?
COSTA:
What's up, baby? Eight o'clock.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
DAX: What are your expectations
for the party?
Get high, fuck bitches, you already know.
- I think we'll come. Can we bring people?
- Can I bring people?
COSTA:
Thomas Kub's house, 8:00.
Oh, shit!
Ahh!
[THOMAS LAUGHS]
COSTA: What we are witnessing is truly
a breathtaking moment...
...in the life of young Thomas.
The helpless fetus is growing
a tiny, tiny penis...
...a penis he may someday insert
into this female's vagina...
...should he survive his first encounter
without her eating him.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Paper towels. Get long.
THOMAS: Don't!
- Dude, get a ton.
Oh, shit. Extra-large condoms.
I'm not paying for that shit.
[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
Attention, valued shoppers.
THOMAS:
Oh, my God.
Join us for an evening of balls-deep
entertainment at Thomas Kub's house.
Dude, stop.
COSTA [IN NORMAL VOICE]: Hey, little buddy.
Want something to drink? Hey.
J. B: He's gonna catch him
and he's gonna get his ass kicked.
[CRYING]
THOMAS: You guys, we good on OJ?
COSTA: Sunny D, dude.
Grab it. Throw it in. I love...
How are we doing on eggs?
Holy shit, dude. It's Miles Teller.
- Dude, it is. That's him. Holy shit.
J. B: He's so badass.
COSTA: Yeah, my boy's starting
at second base for USC.
J. B: He got sent to detention once
and banged the teacher.
Mi-Tell, what's cracking, bro?
- We go to North Pass.
THOMAS: Yeah, dude, big fans.
COSTA: Huge fans.
- Cool. Awesome.
COSTA:
Look, we're making a movie.
J. B: Invite him, man. Come on.
THOMAS: All right. Okay. Um...
We're having a soirée at my place tonight.
If you wanna swing by, it should be...
My boy is underselling this
like a motherfucker.
This shit's gonna be legit.
You should swing by.
Yeah, I can't. I actually got other plans
tonight, so I might not make it.
Dude, think about it. It's on Dickens Street.
We'd love to have you.
- Uh, Dickens Street?
COSTA: Yeah.
That's your party? You're throwing that?
That's where I'm going.
Heard it's gonna be crazy.
That's my party. I'm Thomas Kub.
It's my birthday today.
Yeah, I heard it's gonna be unlimited
high-school pussy.
COSTA:
Dude, high-school pussy for days.
What? Mind your own business, lady.
MILES: How you guys doing on liquor?
You got liquor?
THOMAS:
Uh...
Don't even worry about it, man.
I'll bring it, call my boys up.
- Don't want you to sweat anything.
THOMAS: Thank you so much.
Hey, it's your day. Cool.
See you guys tonight, then.
THOMAS: All right, cool.
- Dickens Street.
- Teller, bring your mitt. We'll play catch.
MILES: No.
- Fuck.
- "Bring your mitt"? The fuck?
[OVER SPEAKERS]
Nothing like black pussy on my dick
Word to the motherfucking DJ Quik
Okay, here's what I want.
Party's limited to the backyard, okay?
The house'll be locked
and the alarm'll be set.
- No one is going inside, all right?
COSTA: Stop.
- Throw down in the bushes?
THOMAS: I don't care.
If I don't fuck a girl with big tits tonight,
I'm drowning myself.
Don't care if she's 300 pounds.
I have to fuck a girl with big tits.
THOMAS: Oh, my God.
COSTA: Feel my drift, J. B?
J. B:
Sure do.
I mean, I'd love to get some oral or,
you know, at least do some finger-banging.
What? Finger-banging?
Can you please elaborate?
You take your first finger,
your thumb and your middle finger.
Make a "come here" motion. "Come here."
This is called "machine guns"
or "friendly scissors."
The "circle of pleasure."
The "itsy-bitsy spider."
Tapping and circling. Tap, tap, tap.
Keep telling her how pretty
she is the whole time.
Shut the fuck up!
- Your loss, man. It's good knowledge.
THOMAS: Oh, my God.
COSTA: Straight up here, then take a right again.
THOMAS: All right, listen.
The three of us will have full access
to the house for sex and finger-banging.
COSTA: Yes.
THOMAS: But no one else, okay?
COSTA:
Of course, bro, we got your back.
- Hey, take a right.
THOMAS: Here?
COSTA: You're gonna want to lock your doors.
THOMAS: Are you serious?
COSTA: Yes, I'm serious.
THOMAS: Where the fuck are we going?
T-Rick's.
Gotta score some of that chronic shit.
J. B: Are you sure this guy's cool?
COSTA: T-Rick's the coolest.
He's ex-military. Wait till you see
his gun collection. Fucking insane.
J. B:
This place is ghetto as fuck.
THOMAS: Why do we have to come
all the way here? We can't just get it at school?
Where do you think the school gets it?
This is wholesale.
THOMAS:
You are literally retarded.
COSTA:
Ah, shut the fuck up.
J. B:
Ah! Fuck.
COSTA:
T-Rick, open up.
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey, what's up, bro?
- I haven't seen you in a minute, Costa.
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you.
- How are you doing? Everything copacetic?
Everything's great. You upgraded the dish.
Looks great.
Yeah, I fucking did, upscaled it.
- Upscaled it. I fucking did.
- Yeah.
- These are my boys, J.B. And Thomas.
J. B: Hi.
All right, yeah, yeah.
Come on in, come on in.
[DOG BARKING]
Oh, yeah, that was a 12-millimeter
semi-automatic Mossberg Maverick.
- I'd love to go to the range with you.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
Going on the range,
get it all out of your system.
Pretend you're killing cops, if you want.
[OVER SPEAKERS]
You're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face
In a crowded place
All right, well, I'll get your stuff.
Here, stoke up the fires, buddy.
COSTA: Oh, man, you the man.
Fuck, yeah, T-Rick.
T-RICK:
Yeah, kick ass with that.
J. B:
Hey, can we get going?
THOMAS: Costa, come sit down, dude.
He's about to fucking...
COSTA: Check it out.
THOMAS: What are you doing?
Fucking stop.
[COSTA GRUNTS]
That's technically a homosexual act.
[COSTA MOANING]
I'm coming on Santa Claus's face.
THOMAS:
Costa, he's coming back.
- Dax, take it, take it.
DAX: What the fuck are you doing?
J. B: Dude, are you stealing it?
COSTA: No, we're just borrowing it.
We need a fucking mascot for the party.
J. B:
Jesus Christ.
T-RICK:
Here you go.
Let's do this, I gotta be at the dojo by 5.
- Absolutely.
- Cool.
See, I told you guys,
T-Rick's just a sweetheart. Mm.
[SNIFFS]
Smell it, J.B.
- You little fucking cocksuckers!
COSTA: Oh, fuck!
- Give me back my fucking gnome!
COSTA: Fuck!
J. B: Give him the gnome back.
Give him the fucking gnome back.
COSTA: No, fuck that! Just go.
J. B: Get out of here!
COSTA: Oh, shit!
J. B: Oh, fuck!
Holy shit, Thomas, he's fucking wild!
He's a fucking crazy man!
Holy shit! He's gone! He fell off!
[TIRES SCREECHING]

J. B: Holy shit!

THOMAS:
Shit, shit, shit!
That's my boy Tom! That was
some serious fucking shit right there!
THOMAS:
What in the fucking world?
J. B:
Fuck. Shit.
THOMAS: Oh, my God.
J. B: Shit.
THOMAS: God, dude,
he fucking cracked my windshield.
COSTA: Fuck it, my cousin owns a body shop.
He can fix it, no problem, man.
[IN CHINESE ACCENT]
The kung fu no good here.
COSTA: Oh, fuck! Holy shit!
- Give me back my gnome!
COSTA: Holy shit!
J. B: Guy's like the fucking Terminator! Jesus!
- No, he was super pissed though.
J. B: Dude scares the shit out of me.
BOY 1:
Hey, boss.
What the fuck?
COSTA: There he is.
This is Everett and his boy Tyler.
They're running security for the night.
THOMAS:
Are you serious? Are those nunchucks?
- Yeah.
THOMAS: Oh, shit.
J. B: Look like ninjas.
- Ninjas are fucking pussies!
COSTA: I love this kid.
- You know it.
COSTA: With these two,
we got nothing to worry about.
- We're outside the Kub house.
BOY 2: Hey.
- We have bogeys.
BOY 2: What up, Costa?
COSTA:
Do I know you guys?
We heard about your shindig tonight.
We want in.
COSTA: You freshmen?
- Yeah.
COSTA: Get the fuck out of here, man.
- Come on, dude.
COSTA: Are you still talking?
Get the fuck out of here.
KYLE:

We got work to do.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Hi. Good evening, Mrs. Stillson.
My name's Oliver.
This is my friend Jonathan.
- And we're both friends of Thomas Kub's.
- Oh.
Yeah, we're hosting a little birthday party
for Thomas.
And we wanted to give you
the courtesy of informing you...
...that there'd possibly be
a bit of party-related noise.
I wanted to give you my number
in case you had problems or concerns.
You're a very beautiful woman.
Call me anytime you want.
- Thank you. That's very sweet of you.
- I mean that when I say that.
You are very beautiful.
- A little party for Thomas. He lives there.
Am I invited?
- Yeah, dude, fine. Yeah, you can come by.
- Nice.
Thank you very much.
Have a good time at your party.
COSTA: Thank you, I appreciate this.
Come by anytime you want.
- All right, see you.
J. B: All right.
- Bye, baby.
COSTA: See you guys.
[COSTA & WOMAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH]
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[DOG BARKING]
J. B: Hi, uh, my name's J.B. I'm a friend of
Thomas Kub, your neighbor across the street.
I just wanted to let you know
that we're gonna be having a party...
...and it may get a little loud and noisy,
but I just wanted to let you know...
...that if you have any concerns,
just let me know and I'll be glad to help out.
You can call me, uh,
you could send me a text message.
I'm an open guy. I even have
a Facebook account. You can send me:
"It's a little too loud," and I'll be like, "I'll tell
them to keep it down." You know how it goes?
[THE HUNDRED IN THE HANDS' "DRESSED

THOMAS: DJ's over there.
J. B: Cool.
- Um, got the bar set up over here.
- Nice.
- Karaoke in the pool house.
- Nice.
Holy shit, dude!
Where'd you get a bouncy-house?
- Costa hooked it up.
- You know it, baby.
Fifty bucks extra with the port-a-potty.
And they threw these in for free.
J. B: Nice touch.
COSTA: Why not? It's a birthday party.
You wanna help? Do something.
- Hey, Chubs, grab your twin brother there.
J. B: Fucking dick.
- Hey, dudes, check it out.
THOMAS: Yeah, like that's gonna work.
COSTA: Yes, it is gonna work. Next time
your pool guy's here, he'll be like:
"Excuse me, Mr. Kub. I seem
to have found some water in your semen."
That's fucking disgusting.
COSTA:
J.B., I thought I told you to pick up ice.
I did. It's in the freezer in the garage.
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Getting in shape for the party.
- The party's in three hours.
- It's mostly water weight.
- Wrestlers do it all the time.
- Wrestlers also wrestle all the time.
- Crank this thing up.
- No.
It's not gonna work
unless you crank it up.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Let's go, come on.
- Dax. Dax, help me.
- No, Dax, you're here to observe.
- Help me! Dax! Aah!
Jesus Christ! Are you all right, dude?
Oh, my God, J.B., are you all right?
An hour from now,
this place is a fucking madhouse.
Not a madhouse, just gonna be a fun,
decent-sized party.
Relax. For you. You.
Me. Dax.
DAX:
Thank you, I don't drink alcohol.
Okay, faggot.
- To one sick fucking night.
- Cheers.

Yes. How are you so fucking bad

COSTA: Shut up, Kirby.
You're killing my concentration right now.

Oh, watch this.
COSTA: Shit!
KIRBY: It looks like I win.
COSTA: Fuck you.
- You guys, it's like 9:20 already.
COSTA: Dude, relax.
People are gonna show up. I promise, bro.
KIRBY: Getting late.
- I'll look like such a dick if no one shows.
Shut the fuck up. It's pissing me off that
you don't trust me to know what I'm doing.
I'm the hub of a large social circle.
I put the word out, it goes out.
THOMAS:
Okay, cool.
- Oh, shit.
COSTA: What the fuck are you wearing?
KIRBY: My God.
THOMAS: Nice.
KIRBY: You're gonna get laid, dude.
- Ladies love a guy with class.
Are you retarded?
Jesus Christ, man.
Where do you even get shit like that?
- Men's Wearhouse.
- Men's Wearhouse? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Look, man, I don't mean to be
a dick here or anything.
Oliver came over earlier and told me
you guys were having a little party...
...but this is too much.
Yeah, we actually should be winding down,
like midnight, I mean, maybe 1.
- Is that okay?
- No, it's not.
The baby can't sleep,
Melinda works early tomorrow.
Fuck, yeah!
My boy Rob is here to rage! Mwah!
- Good to see you.
- Actually, I'm not raging.
I'm telling Thomas
it's time to shut it down.
You can't be serious.
This is a great party.
I am serious, because it's 11:30 at night.
It's time to wrap it up.
J. B:
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't we bring everyone to the back,
lower the volume?
Guys, this isn't a request.
The party's over.
I guess we're just gonna have to
agree to disagree, then, aren't we?
Listen to me, Thomas.
Either shut it down or I'm calling the cops.
Ahh.
Fine. Fuck it.
I'm calling the fucking cops... Aah!
COSTA: Fuck!
THOMAS: Oh, shit!
Jesus fucking Christ!
What'd you do that for?
COSTA: Are you kidding me?
I will fucking kill you!
The little fuck Tased me!
I'm definitely calling the cops now!
You punched a kid in the face!
I'm calling the cops on you.
Do it, genius. It's all on tape.
I just saw this motherfucker record it.

that little child's face.
Fuck you.
COSTA:
Go home, Robert!

It was just a kid, man!
- Are you all right, man?
THOMAS: Is he okay?
You're a fucking champion.
He sucker-punched you.
You'd own that bitch in a real fight.
- You think so?
- I know so.
Fuck that asshole. You're killing it, bro.
BOY: Yo, Costa, what's up?
- Yo, go in the back.
I need you to dial back like 10, 15 percent.
You can't hard-charge all the time.
All right? And lose the Taser, okay?
- Got it.
- Get down here.
We need a post
up at the cockbiter's house.
If he calls the cops,
I want you to radio it over to me, okay?
Get out of here. Go.

See, the kid's a pro.
We got nothing to worry about.

you cannot enter...

Is there an adult here
we might speak with?
You're speaking with one.
I'm 18 and a half years old, sir.
And, of course, in my culture
I've been a man since my 13th birthday.
So you're telling us we cannot come in?
With all due respect,
technically the law says you cannot.
But what we're saying is, you may not.
I guess both are true. The law says
you cannot because we say you may not.

I hooked up with Kirby.
I'm, like, really into her.
Okay, seriously, Thomas,
that's, you know, cool and all.
But she's kind of always been around.
It's like hooking up with J.B.
But her tits are smaller.
- Hey.
- I'm just saying.
Kirby's sort of like one of us.
You know, tonight's about the girls
we never had a shot at.
Tonight's about changing the game.

I know that you want no more
Maybe in the factory
Maybe in the actual world

neighborhood. They trashed the house.
We heard that Kanye
made an appearance there.
Yeah, so if you were there at the party
in Pasadena last night, hit us up...
...because we're gonna be talking about it
all morning long in the neighborhood.
- I really am sorry.

Do you have any idea how much
all this is gonna cost, Thomas?
Your college fund is gone,
I can tell you that.

It's not that complicated.
What you did was really not cool.
It really hurt me.
Kirby, I'm really sorry about
what happened.
I didn't know how to handle it.
But I think I do now
and that's why I'm here.
My life right now, it's totally ruined.
Okay? I practically burned down
my whole neighborhood.
Probably bankrupt my parents.
I'll be in debt until I die.
But the only thing that I care about
fixing right now is this.
So, I'm sorry.
If you're still mad, I get it...
...but if you are talking to me
by my next birthday...
...I'd really like to spend it with just you.
Oh, you're...
So we're cool again?
I never said you were cool.
So you know this high school party
in Pasadena that turned into a riot, right?
The kid actually burned his parents'
house down. Can you imagi...?
Do you know how many chores
it's gonna take to make up for...
[AUDIENCE LAUGHING]
He'll be taking the trash out
nine times a day for the rest of his life.
REPORTER: The person who caused
the early morning fire and explosion here...
...has survived his injuries...
T-RICK: Costa!
We moved to a place like Pasadena
to avoid stuff like this.
Some asshole puked all over
my front door.
Do these kids even have parents?
It's ridiculous, right?
Have you seen the footage?
Let me tell you.
I haven't seen that many teenage boobs
since R. Kelly's birthday party.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Joining us now live is one Pasadena teen
who's recently drawn a lot of notice...
...for throwing what people
are calling...
...possibly the most epic
high-school party of all time.
Costa, before we begin, is there anything
that you would like to say to the viewers?
In fact, I would.
You said it was perhaps
the most epic party of all time.
It was the most epic party of all time.
Okay. I was thinking more along
the lines of an apology.
Would you like to apologize?
I got a better idea.
How about I invite you to my next party?
- What?
- Yeah, you heard me, sugar-tits.
Just make sure
you wear something tight.
