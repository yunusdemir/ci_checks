eXistenZ. Written like this.
One word.
Small "E,"
capital "X,"
capital " Z."
"eXistenZ."
It's new,
it's from Antenna Research
and it's here...
right now.
We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want
you to help us with our product testing.
We're a team,
Antenna and you.
Those of you who have come to our
invited seminars before...
will know that I normally
lead the groups through our new games.
But tonight
it won't be me. No.
For our test launch
of eXistenZ by Antenna,
we have brought you a seminar leader
who is rather special.
Yes, it is.
The world's greatest game designer
is here, in person,
to lead you,
our first test enclave,
through her newest creation,
eXistenZ by Antenna.
I give you the game-pod goddess herself,
Allegra Geller.
Allegra! Allegra!
Yeah! Allegra!
The world of games
is in a kind of a trance.
People are programmed
to accept so little,
but the possibilities
are so great.
eXistenZ is not just...
a game.
It's an entirely
new game system.
And, uh,
it involves a whole lot of new toys, which
you are going to be the first to try out.
So-
We have 12 prototype
MetaFlesh game-pods,
and that means that for
our first wave test enclave...
we need 12 volunteers who will port
into these slave units...
with the game-pod
goddess herself.
- Okay, if I pick you out-
- Hold it! Not so fast.
Oh, jeez.
Right.
Oh, God. I'm not late, am I?
Did I miss the port-in?
It's just the first wave.
You can be part of the second wave.
You and the guy at the back
with the gray hair.
You, sir. This lady here.
Just come up. Thank you.
- Noel Dichter?
- Yes?
- Put your arms up. I have to scan you.
- It's a weapons check?
More for recording devices.
Lot of money invested
in these games, Noel.
Our assistants
will then help you to port your pod...
into your bio-ports
using Antenna Research's new-
- What's in this case?
- Oh, I brought my game-pod.
It's, uh, got original
Marway tissue architecture.
I know it's kind of obsolete. Even though
I couldn't afford the Antenna 15 upgrade,
- I figured out this method of virtual
porting- - You won't need it tonight.
Everything's provided for.
- How are you doin'? You okay?
- So what do you think? Two hours tops?
Oh, two, three hours.
- So you're saying three hours?
- Yeah.
Okay.
Everything's in order.
Are you ready, Allegra?
Sure, this is
my favorite part.
Take it away.
All right. I'm ready to download eXistenZ
by Antenna Research into all of you.
Now, I'm warning you.
It's going to be a wild ride.
But don't panic...
no matter
what happens, okay?
All right.
I'll see ya back here in no time at all.
She seems to be
very shy.
Never occurred to me
that a big star would be shy.
She spends most of her time
alone in a room designing her games.
I think she'd like it best if she never
had to show them to anybody.
- Death to the demoness, Allegra Geller!
- No!
Everybody out! Clear out now!
Death to
Antenna Research!
Get her out of here. Save her.
There might be more of them.
- Me? Me? Me take her?
- Go on!
We have enemies in our own house.
Trust no one!
Trust no one.
Miss Geller, you're coming with me.
I'm responsible for you.
You're supposed to come with me.
Well, what are we
gonna do out here?
Do you know your way around?
Do you know any country people?
Not country people,
games people.
Countryside's full of
games development people:
project coordinators, little factories,
you name it.
Okay, so you know your way around.
We can hide out.
Maybe.
It seems like I have some enemies
I didn't know I had.
"Death to Allegra Geller."
How would you like to hear
someone with a gun screaming...
"Death to
Ted Pikul?
Wow.
Hey, how'd you
know my name?
You're labeled.
Yeah.
What's that?
It's my pink-fone.
Ted Pikul.
What happen-
What?
Hey!
What did you
do that for?
- That was our lifeline to civilization.
- That was a range finder.
- As long as you have that, they know where we are.
- "They"
- You mean head office.
- I mean anybody.
Pikul, why don't
you have a gun?
- What?
- You're not armed.
They told me you're my security,
but you have no weaponry.
Who told you that?
I'm just a marketing trainee.
Fucking hell.
I'm marked for death, and they send me
on the road with a P.R. nerd!
Marked for death.
Marked for death.
- Oh, jeez.
- Okay.
Don't sweat it, Pikul.
Don't sweat it.
I'm gonna handle it.
And, uh, right now
we need to stop.
We do? Why?
So we can have
an intimate moment together.
Come on. If you're
gonna do it, do it.
Okay. Okay?
Mm-hmm.
- Wow. Did somebody bite you?
- What?
What I just dug out of you-
It's a tooth,
a human...
tooth.
Let me see that
weirdo pistol.
Yep.
The bullets are
human teeth.
This one's got
a cavity.
That thing was designed
to get past any kind...
of metal
or synthetics detector.
It's all flesh
and bone.
I suppose the smaller caliber pistols
would have to fire baby teeth.
The tooth fairy could go
into the arms business.
- Where were you just now?
- I was wandering through eXistenZ.
The new system,
I mean.
I like it in there.
'Course, without another player,
you're only a tourist.
It's frustrating.
Why won't you
let me contact Antenna?
They've gotta be going crazy wondering
what's happened to you.
I mean, it's not like
we've done something wrong.
We just ran because we didn't know
how many of them there were, right?
I think we owe it to Antenna
to let them know you're all right...
and to get them to send somebody
to help you who knows what he's doing.
Besides, I can't-
I can't just keep doing this,
whatever it is,
you know, forever.
Not having any idea
when it's going- Hey!
- What are you doing?
- Where is your bio-port?
Oh, don't tell me
you've never been fitted.
- I can't believe it. - No, I was never
fitted with a bio-port. What do you care?
Well, you want to get into the biz, and
you've never played one of my games?
You've never played
any game.
Look,
I've been dying
to play your games,
but I have
this phobia...
about having my body
penetrated surgically.
You know what
I mean.
No. I'm not sure
that I do.
Getting a bio-port fitted.
I don't know.
I can't do it.
It's too freaky.
Makes my skin crawl.
They just pop your spine
with a little hydro-gun.
They shoot
the port plug into it.
They do it at malls.
It's like getting your ears pierced.
Yeah, sure. With only an infinitesimal
chance of permanent spinal paralysis.
- I've read all about it.
- Hey, it's your chosen profession.
Besides, once you're ported-
zzzt-
there's no end
to the games you can play.
You can't seriously wanna
play games now.
Not here. Not while we're
being hunted down by crazy people.
My baby here took a huge hit
in the church, Pikul.
One of those UmbyCords
got ripped out of her.
Ripped out of her...
just as the game architecture
was being downloaded from her...
to all those slave-pods.
That's a very
vulnerable time for her.
She could be crying out for help
right here, right now.
The only way...
I can tell if the game's
not been contaminated-
The pod is not about to be crippled
for life because of my negligence-
is to play eXistenZ...
with somebody friendly.
Are you friendly,
or are you not?
Sure.
All right.
Let's do it.
Let's do it now.
Let me see.
To get...
an illegal, unregistered
bio-port installed...
at about midnight,
we just drive up to your
local country gas station, right?
Anything else
I can do for ya?
Well, Gas, you could check
your bio-port plugs.
The what?
Sparkplugs?
You heard me.
My friend here has
a bio-port problem.
A bio-port?
Now, that's a sorta hole in your spine,
isn't it?
Lots of assholes around here,
but that's generally it.
I don't know why you'd be
talkin' to me about that, lady.
Sure you do.
Oh.
Oh.
Allegra Geller,
you've changed
my life.
What was your life
like before?
Before?
Before it was changed
by Allegra Geller.
I operated
a gas station.
You still operate a gas station,
don't you?
Only on the most pathetic
level of reality.
Geller's work liberated me.
- Liberated?
- Did you ever play her game ArtGod?
- One word. Capital "A," capital "G."
- I don't have a bio-port.
Thou, the player of the game ArtGod.
Very spiritual.
Funny too.
God, the artist, the mechanic.
Funny.
Here we go.
Those are sterilized,
aren't they?
Not to worry.
The way they set things up...
you could fire in a bio-port
in a slaughterhouse...
and never generate
an infection.
Then why
the clean overalls?
Hmm. It's a mental thing.
Helps me focus.
The one thing
you don't wanna do...
is miss with
the stud finder.
- Oh, God.
- God, the mechanic.
Step into my office.
See? That didn't
hurt, did it?
I didn't expect
that to hurt.
I expect the next part
to hurt.
Yeah, that's what
I expect to hurt.
I haven't
crippled anyone yet.
- How many have you done?
- Three.
Well, you'll be
my third.
Shh. Shh.
Hey! Easy.
Easy.
- What's goin' on, Gas?
- Hell,
he's actin' like
I'm attackin' him.
People usually pay me
to do this, you know.
Yeah?
All two of 'em!
As you can see, I've decided
not to have a bio-port installed.
This is it, ya see?
This is the cage of your own making...
which keeps you trapped
and pacing about...
in the smallest
possible space forever.
Break outta
your cage, Pikul.
Break out now.
The swelling
doesn't last for long.
Tomorrow, you won't
even notice it.
I love it.
Great.
What's going on?
I can't- I can't move my legs!
The procedure comes
with its own epidural.
Just like when
you have a baby.
Kinda like instant paralysis from the
waist down. That's why it didn't hurt you.
It'll wear off
in no time.
I'm gonna go
wash up.
You two,
make yourselves at home.
You don't have to wait
for the swelling to go down.
You're gonna port into me...
while I'm paralyzed?
You wanted to play
my game, didn't you?
Yeah, I did.
I do, but-
Here? Now?
It's an instant-on world,
isn't it?
What's that for?
Feels... cold.
New ports are sometimes a bit tight.
Wouldn't wanna
hurt ya.
How come...
bio-ports don't
get infected?
I mean,
they open right
into your body.
Listen to what
you're saying, Pikul.
Don't be ludicrous.
Don't you think
you could call me Ted?
Maybe afterwards.
Shit!
Pikul!
I can't believe it.
You blew my pod!
- You must have neural-surged!
- What do you mean?
I jacked you into my pod, and you
obviously panicked. Now it's totally fucked!
This is a disaster.
I was nervous,
but I didn't panic.
I was forced to trust you and you
panicked and you neural-surged...
and you blew
my pod.
You can get
a new pod.
Pikul,
in this pod
is the only-
the original version
of eXistenZ,
an entire game system
that cost 38 million to develop,
not including prerelease
marketing costs,
and I'm locked
outside my own game.
I can't get me in
or it out!
Are you serious?
That's the only version
that exists?
It's the only one and it's stuck inside
and it's your fault.
I've devoted five of my most passionate
years to this strange little creature.
And I've never
regretted it, Pikul,
'cause I knew it was the only thing
that could give my life any meaning.
Allegra,
why is it my fault?
I'm telling you
I didn't-
I did not neural-surge.
I didn't.
I didn't feel any surging.
It's not your fault.
It's my fault.
Oh, no, Gas.
Not you.
I wouldn't try to use
that bio-port again.
'Cept maybe for
a toaster or somethin'.
What's goin' on?
You're worth a lot of money...
if you're dead.
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talkin' about.
It's all over the countryside.
Five million dollars for her dead body.
No questions asked.
But, she changed
your life.
Yep. And now
I'm gonna change hers.
Wait! Why did you install
a bad port into me?
Seems there's a big bonus for killing
Allegra Geller's latest game...
or whatever it is.
I think I just did that,
didn't I?
But can you kill me, Gas?
Can you kill a person?
Can you do that?
Hide my body?
Contact the crazies?
Trust them to pay up?
Hand over my now decaying,
fucking grotesque corpse?
Really expect them to
hand over five mil cash?
I mean, don't you ever go
to the fucking movies?
I like your script.
I wanna be in it.
Oh, God.
I think he's dead.
- He wanted to kill you.
- Yep.
That's two people
in one day...
who wanted
to actually kill you.
I've never been
more popular.
Allegra, we need help.
You're right. I've gotta
get this pod fixed.
We're going skiing?
Hey. Hey.
Look at that huge bug.
It's got two heads.
It's not a bug.
It's a mutated amphibian.
It's a frog-salamander-
lizard thing.
Sign of the times.
What happens if somebody comes up here
and really wants to ski?
Come on, Pikul. Nobody actually
physically skis anymore. You know that.
No, don't use that!
And bring me the sterile wash.
My darling.
Allegra Geller.
I'm so pleased and-
so astonished to see you here.
- Kiri Vinokur, my bodyguard, Ted Pikul.
- Hello.
Sterile wash.
Um, I hear this
ridiculous story...
about some
fatwa against you.
The company are desperately
trying to find you.
Now, is-is this really serious?
Are you in danger?
There, uh, have been
a couple of attempts on my life already.
But this is unbearable. The company
must stop this. They owe you protection.
But I don't-
I don't know if they can do anything.
It seems to be
open season on me.
Well, you will be safe here.
I assure you of that.
I will contact Antenna right away and have
them send some people over to collect you.
No, Kiri, don't. You mustn't
let anybody know that we're here.
I can't be sure that Antenna
is completely safe for me.
I understand. Yes.
You know,
you can hide out
in one of the guest chalets...
as long as you like.
And I'll make sure
you get fresh towels.
And make sure I don't lose
everything I have in here.
You bet.
Take that.
Good.
Pull this back.
- What did you port into?
- Pikul's bio-port.
Really? That's what caused
all the damage.
It was, uh-
It was a flawed installation. My first.
Well,
it fried a lot
of very expensive neural webbing.
- You see?
- Looks like an animal in there.
Feels like you're operating
on somebody's pet dog.
I told you, Landry,
we have become...
glorified veterinarians.
Put a little
in there, please.
The eXistenZ game-pod
is basically an animal, Mr. Pikul.
It's grown from fertilized
amphibian eggs...
stuffed with
synthetic DNA.
Only Antenna Research
has this.
Wow. Where do
the batteries go?
Very funny.
He's not kidding.
He's a total P.R. nerd.
It ports into you.
You're the power source:
your body, your nervous system,
your metabolism, your energy.
You get tired, run down,
it won't run properly.
Okay. Landry here
will finish up the pod work.
Now, let's, uh, get that
nasty bio-port out of you,
put a nice fresh one
in there.
- Oww! It hurts.
- Shh!
I think
it's infected.
No. It's
not infected.
It's just excited.
It wants action.
But, I really don't think that
I want action. Me, I mean,
the bearer of
the excited bio-port.
My baby here has now taken
three major hits, Pikul:
one in the church, one in the gas
station and one on the operating table.
The only way I can tell
if everything's okay...
is to play eXistenZ...
with somebody friendly.
Are you friendly,
or are you not?
You're telling me this thing'll run
off my body's energy?
That's how they work.
See? You're
hummin' along already.
Okay. eXistenZ,
only from Antenna.
- Here we go.
- You-
You've got a bit of an unfair advantage,
don't you?
How can I possibly compete
with the designer of the system?
Well,
you could beat the guy
that invented poker, couldn't you?
- You want that one?
- Yes. That one.
- I'm asking, are you sure you want that one?
- Yes.
- I wouldn't recommend it.
- Why not?
The graphics on this one are better.
- In fact, there's no comparison.
- Really?
- This is the one you want.
- That one?
- This one here.
- That was beautiful.
I feel just like me.
Is that kind of transition normal?
That kinda...
smooth, interlacing
from place to place?
It depends on
the style of the game.
You can get jagged,
brutal cuts,
slow fades,
shimmering little morphs.
This is amazing.
I had no idea.
Look at this.
Games I've never heard of.
Wait a minute.
That reminds me.
What precisely is the goal of the game
that we are playing now?
You have to play
the game...
to find out why
you're playing the game.
It's the future,
Pikul.
You'll see
how natural it feels.
Look at this.
Can this be the future too?
Ever see anything like this before?
These are delicate.
You got to be careful.
Yes, I can imagine.
Cortical Systematics
is the latest and the hottest.
Not just a new game,
but a new system.
Will it work with
an industry-standard bio-port?
I'm D'arcy Nader.
Welcome to D'arcy Nader's
Game Emporium.
Is there anything I can be,
oh, uh, helpin' you with?
We're just looking.
I have what you're
lookin' for.
Who sent you?
It's none of your business
who sent us.
We're here.
That's all that matters.
God.
What happened?
I- I didn't mean to say that.
It's your character
who said it.
It's kind of a schizophrenic feeling,
isn't it? You'll get used to it.
There are things that have to be said to
advance the plot and establish the characters,
and those things get said
whether you wanna say them or not.
Don't fight it.
Just go with it.
But should you be saying
this in front of him?
Look at 'im.
- What's he doing?
He's gone into a game loop.
He won't come out of it until you
give him a proper line of game dialogue.
Uh, this is tricky.
Start by repeating
your last line.
Include his name so he knows
you're talking to 'im.
We're here, D'arcy Nader,
and that's all that matters.
Yes, you're right.
That is all
that matters.
Now, you said you have
what we want.
We're waiting.
You're going to need
these micro-pods...
to download your
new identities.
I assume that you both
have had these...
industry-standard bio-ports
that you mentioned installed.
Yes, of course.
We both have bio-ports.
- We do, don't we?
- I assumed we did.
In the game, of course,
we might not.
We better check.
Yeah, it's there. Looks
a little different, but it's there.
Yeah, I see
what you mean.
Yes, we both
have bio-ports.
Good.
Port in,
and-and this will tell ya all
you need to know...
for now.
I'm-I'm gonna leave
while you two, uh,
finish up here, because,
uh, it wouldn't be good
for us all to be seen together.
I assume that Nader's our...
entry point
into the game.
- Yeah. Kinda disappointing.
- Nader?
Yeah. He's not
a very well-drawn character.
His dialogue was just so-so.
His accent and his- Um.
Yeah.
Okay.
Pods are so small.
They plug directly
into the bio-port.
Okay.
- Oh, God!
- What happened?
The whole pod just
disappeared into your back.
It disappeared
into my back?
- It's in my spine? It's working its way 'round my spinal cord?
- Don't panic. It's just a game.
Do you feel
anything yet?
No, I don't.
Not a thing.
I don't feel a thing.
- Do you want me to do you?
- Yeah.
What the hell
was that?
That wasn't me.
It was my game character.
I wouldn't have done that.
Not here, anyway.
Our characters are obviously
supposed to jump on each other.
It's most
probably a...
pathetically
mechanical attempt...
to heighten the emotional tension
of the next game sequence.
- No use fighting it, huh?
- What about... our new identities?
Do you feel yours yet?
They'll take care
of themselves.
I'm very worried
about my body.
Your what?
Where are
our real bodies?
Are they all right? What if they're
hungry? What if there's danger?
They're just where
we left them.
They're sitting quietly.
Eyes closed.
It's, um,
just like meditating.
I feel really vulnerable.
- Disembodied.
- Okay.
Don't sweat it.
All your senses
are still operating.
You're gonna pop right outta the game
if there's a problem.
Trying to remember who you are?
Hey.
Hey, it works.
I must be
Yevgeny Nourish.
And you, you are new
to Trout Farm?
Yeah.
Yes, I'm-
I'm very new.
- Did you say Trout Farm?
- Yeah, Trout Farm.
Trout Farm, you know, raising baby trout
from eggs and releasing them in rivers.
Entire place used
to be Trout Farm.
From outside you would never guess
it's now factory for making game-pods.
Seems like most everything used
to be something else, yes?
You might be new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.
It surprises me more than
it surprises you.
You might be new, but you seem
to know what you're doing.
I've been trained
by the very best.
So have I, my friend.
So have I.
Where are you planning
to have lunch?
I'm new here. Uh,
I have no plans
for lunch.
May I suggest the Chinese restaurant
in the forest?
Everyone knows where it is.
Just ask.
Well, won't you
be going there too?
Unfortunately, I have
other plans for lunch,
but I do suggest
you order the special.
And don't take " no"
for answer.
All right.
I'll do that.
- Larry!
- Yes?
They need this in the back room.
They asked for you.
Hey.
I saw you make contact,
Larry Ashen.
What'd the guy on the assembly line
say to you?
Can you believe the game version
of your pod? It's sick.
And so unconvincing.
I mean,
using mutated animal organs
and nervous systems as game-pod parts...
is certainly
feasible, but...
everything here's
so dirty,
absurd, grotesque.
I saw you make contact,
Larry Ashen.
What'd the guy on the assembly line
say to you?
He told me
where to have lunch.
We have nice
sea bass today.
Shall I bring it
for everyone?
We want
the special.
Did you hear me,
Chinese waiter?
We want the special.
The special is
for special occasions.
I cannot give you
the special.
But... this is...
a special occasion.
It's... her birthday.
A birthday is
a special occasion.
I will, therefore,
bring a special for everybody.
- I guess the special isn't very popular.
- I guess not.
- I want to put the game on pause.
- Huh?
The game can be paused,
can't it?
I mean, all games
can be paused, right?
Yeah. Sure.
But why? What's wrong?
I mean, aren't you dying to see
what's so special about the special?
I'm feeling... a little disconnected
from my real life.
I'm kinda losing touch
with the texture of it.
You know what I mean?
I mean, I actually think...
there's an element
of psychosis involved here.
Yes. This is
a great sign.
It means your nervous system is fully
engaging with the game architecture.
eXistenZ is paused!
Did I do that?
I guess I did.
- So, how does it feel?
- What?
Your real life.
The one you came back for.
It feels completely unreal.
You're stuck now,
aren't ya?
You want to go back to the Chinese restaurant
'cause there's nothing happening here.
We're safe.
It's boring.
It's worse than that.
I'm not sure.
I- I'm not sure here,
where we are,
is real at all.
This feels like
a game to me.
And you,
you're beginning to feel
a bit like a game character.
Definitely not.
Let's go back.
Special order for the birthday girl.
Hope you enjoy it
very much.
Look, it's our two-headed friend.
Doesn't look
too healthy.
I think I lost
my appetite.
Oh, a shame.
Mutant reptiles
and amphibians provide...
new and previously
unimagined taste sensations.
Shall I clear
all this away?
No. Um,
we're... happy.
Very good.
Enjoy.
Pikul,
what are you doing?
I don't know.
I find this disgusting,
but I can't help myself.
- Good.
- Good? You think this is good?
Yeah, it's
a genuine game urge.
It's something your game character
was born to do. Don't fight it.
I'm fighting it,
but it isn't
doing me any good.
Oh, my God.
This looks
awfully familiar.
You sure this
is okay?
Yeah, it...
should be okay.
Do you have that bridge
in real life?
Absolutely not.
My teeth are perfect.
Death... to the demoness,
Allegra Geller.
That's not funny.
Sorry.
But, you know,
I do feel the urge
to kill someone here.
Who?
- I need to kill our waiter.
- Oh.
Well, that makes sense.
Um, waiter!
Waiter!
When he comes over, do it.
Don't hesitate.
But...
everything in the game
is so realistic, I-
I don't think
I really could.
You won't be able to stop yourself.
You might as well enjoy it.
Free will is obviously...
not a big factor
in this little world of ours.
It's like real life. There's
just enough to make it interesting.
He's too nice.
I won't do it.
What can I do to make your lunch
more pleasant?
I found this in my soup,
and I'm very upset.
It's all right!
Just, uh,
a little misunderstanding...
over the check.
Pay no attention,
and enjoy your meal!
I feel a serious game urge
to get outta here.
Through the kitchen.
That way.
Did you like the meal
I prepared for you?
Yeah.
It was very...
revealing.
Yes, it certainly was
for me.
You both passed our little test
with flying colors.
- Why did the Chinese waiter have to die?
- A waiter hears many things...
spoken when people are
relaxing and eating.
A waiter has many opportunities
for betrayal.
- He betrayed you?
- He betrayed us. Us.
Come... this way.
Come.
These are
the breeding pools.
- Breeding pools.
- Is this, uh-
Is this where you caught
today's special?
We originally were raising
these mutant creatures...
for their nervous systems
for game-pods,
but then we found
they could be quite tasty.
And so we opened the restaurant,
and now that is our cover.
But, of course, we are also raising them
as components...
for undetectable
and hypoallergenic weapons...
right under the noses
of our enemies.
And speaking of our enemies,
it's important that you go back
to work at Cortical Systematics.
We-We need to maintain
as many agents there as possible.
The Trout Farm is owned
by Cortical Systematics?
Yeah. Their corporate slogan
should be " Enemies of Reality."
Someday soon, we will destroy Trout Farm
and all game-pods inside it.
We love you...
now that you have proven to be
true and trustworthy Realists.
We'll be in touch.
I'm looking for D'Arcy Nader.
Is he here?
Hugo Carlaw,
is D'Arcy Nader here?
He's in the back.
You want him?
There he is.
You shouldn't
have killed the Chinese waiter.
Why not?
He was your contact at the Trout Farm.
Damn good man.
His, uh, dog
brought me this.
We were contacted there by Yevgeny Nourish.
He seemed to know exactly who we were.
That's because Nader
tipped him off that you were coming.
Nader was a mole
for Cortical Systematics.
- You're with the Realist underground.
- Yes.
I was placed here
to keep an eye on Nader.
If Nourish isn't our real contact,
who is he?
Nourish is a double agent for Cortical
Systematics. He was working with Nader...
to subvert the Realist cause and doing it
rather well; after all, he got you to...
assassinate your
own contact.
But now you're gonna
put a stop to him.
I don't want to be here.
Come on, Pikul.
You've just got a bad case
of first-time-user anxiety.
I don't like it here.
I don't know what's going on.
We're both stumbling around together
in this unformed world...
whose rules and objectives
are largely unknown,
seemingly indecipherable
or even possibly nonexistent,
always on the verge of being killed
by forces that we don't understand.
That sounds like
my game all right.
That sounds like a game that's
not gonna be easy to market.
But it's a game everybody's
already playing.
The cashier said
it would be in a familiar place.
Is there such
a thing here?
My assembly bay.
Psst.
Is that it over there?
God, it's ugly
even for a game-pod.
I have a terrible urge
to port into it.
- What about you?
- Sure. Yeah.
Desperate to port
into it.
All right. Here
we go. You want to give me a hand?
You're not serious.
I mean, that's a diseased pod.
- You port into that-
- Yes, exactly.
Help me.
How long does it take
for the infection to take hold?
No time at all.
And then you quietly
port into all the other pods and...
spread the infection
to them.
Oh, God.
- What's happening?
- Something's wrong.
I'm gonna unport you now.
Ah, God!
Don't! Don't!
- That really- That really hurts.
- I'm gonna cut you free.
- Oh. No, I'm afraid!
- Shh.
Pikul,
I'm bleeding
to death.
I'm sorry.
I don't know-
I don't know what else to do!
I know what to do.
I know exactly
what to do.
Death to Realism!
Burn!
Burn, diseased pod!
Spores!
No! No, spores!
Deadly spores!
Spores, no.
Death to the demoness!
Demoness!
I think we just lost the game,
or maybe not.
Allegra, we're back home.
We're back home.
Pikul. Pikul.
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- It's here.
It's happened.
It's come back here with us.
We brought it back
from eXistenZ.
Brought what back?
I can't understand what you're saying.
We brought the disease
back with us!
My pod is diseased.
Oh, God.
I'm really gonna lose it.
I'm gonna lose
my game.
Unport me.
Come on. Unport me.
All right.
Okay.
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.
This-This can't
be possible.
How can a game event
merge into real life?
There's a very weird reality
bleed-through effect happening here.
I'm not sure I get it.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
What's in the needle?
It's a sporicide. Pods
are susceptible to spore infections.
It can work if you get it in time.
Come on. Come on.
- Let me see your bio-port.
- What?
Let me see it!
What?
I know what happened.
It's Kiri Vinokur, that bastard!
- Vinokur?
- He gave you a new bio-port, didn't he?
Oh, God.
He gave you an infected bio-port so that my
pod would die and so would my game system!
I'm infected?
Wait a minute.
The poor thing was trying
to tell us that it was sick...
by introducing the theme
of disease into the game.
The theme of disease?
I'm fucking really infected!
- What, is it gonna crawl up my spine and rot my brain?
- All right. All right.
Just calm down.
I've got something that will help you.
Turn around.
I'm gonna seal up your bio-port
with this sporicidal resonator.
It uses the Umby pick-ups
for power.
It should cleanse all your porting
channels of infection within a few hours.
It's gonna give you a slight skin buzz
when it's done.
- 'Course, we can't play until then.
- Great.
Now, listen.
Listen.
This-This could be critical.
Were you really saying...
- That Vinokur is an agent for the-
- Oh, God.
Pikul, my pod's dying.
I can't help it.
There's nothing I can do for it.
Shh.
The uprising has begun!
The world is in flames! Let's go!
You gotta get outta here!
They're gonna be lookin' for ya!
The cashier. He's a game character.
How can he be here?
Leave that rotting piece of meat here!
It's done its job!
I keep my game inside there.
I can't let my game die. No!
Wait!
Allegra, listen to me.
Listen to me!
I think we're still
inside the game.
I think your pod's out there somewhere,
somewhere safe.
I think it's all right
to let go of this one, this pod.
It's not
the real one.
Everybody out!
Now!
This way! Come on!
Follow me!
This way!
Come on!
Up here!
- You can see everything from up here!
- What is it that we're seeing?
The victory of Realism,
and you were part of it.
The death of eXistenZ,
and we were part of it.
There's just one more thing.
We're on your side!
How could you be?
How could Allegra Geller, the world's
premiere game designer, be on our side?
Oh, yeah.
We know who you are.
You can't hide inside
a game forever.
Something's slipped over the edge here,
Allegra. Something's all wrong.
See what I mean?
See the problem?
I tried to find you.
Thank God I got here in time.
My dog brought me this.
You didn't get here
in time!
My game is dead!
You murdered my game!
No. I murdered
your pod.
- Your game is healthy and happy.
- No.
I replicated your pod's
entire nervous system...
during our little surgical
procedure at the chalet.
Complete with contents.
You copied eXistenZ?
Allegra,
come over
to Cortical Systematics.
Yes. Yes.
Cortical Systematics.
I am defecting and so are all
Antenna top brass.
You're a spy
for Cortical Systematics?
If you want to be reunited
with your baby, you'll come over to us.
Can you talk to her?
It would be best for everyone.
I mean, you can come
with us too.
What the fuck
are you doing?
You've killed him.
You gonna kill
me next?
Pikul, he was only
a game character.
I didn't like the way
he was messing with my mind.
You didn't like that?
So you killed him.
He's only a game character.
Allegra, what if we're not
in the game anymore?
If-
If we're not-
If we're not, then you
just killed someone real.
It was no accident that
you and I ended up on the run together.
- Not an accident?
- No.
That's why you never had a bio-port.
You were one of them.
I still am
one of them.
- But you have a bio-port now. - I made
the bio-port sacrifice to get close to you.
- Why would you want that?
- To understand what I have to kill.
Then understand this.
Understand I knew that
you were my real assassin...
when you pointed the gun at me
in the Chinese restaurant.
And understand that...
you're dead.
Death to the demon,
Ted Pikul!
Have I won?
Have I won the game?
Have I won?
Are you all back?
We're back.
We're back, Merle,
but I have a feeling some of our crew
doesn't realize it yet.
Wow! Anybody want a bowl
of hot and sour soup?
It's on me.
Yes, I'll have some... if you make sure
there's some mutated amphibian...
nervous systems
in the rice.
You know, my accent in the game...
was so thick
I could hardly understand myself.
- How long were we gone?
- About 20 minutes.
God, it seemed like days.
It's fantastic.
Just think about it, man.
If you stayed your whole life...
in the game world,
then you could live to about,
I don't know,
uh, 500 years.
The twists and turns at the end
made my, uh, head spin.
Maybe there was too many
too fast to absorb.
Uh, I, uh, sucked,
but you guys were great.
I mean, you were like
game divas.
You know, personally
I think you both deserve to win.
I- I was really
bummed out at first.
I got knocked out of the game
so soon.
It was fantastic how mean you were.
It was really scary and crazy.
I had a lot to do in that first scene
at the church, but...
- I thought the character was boring.
- Hmm.
Well, no matter how boring you were,
you still all get a certificate,
a certificate for
helping us out here.
And, uh, am I right about this, Merle?
I think-
Yes, and that will entitle you
to reserve one of the first batch...
of the transCendenZ
by PilgrImage game modules...
to hit the market
at a seriously discounted price.
You're gonna love it.
Remember, it's written like this:
capital " C," capital " Z,"
transCendenZ.
It's new. It's from PilgrImage,
capital "P," capital "I,"
- And it's coming soon.
- I just want to say thank you to Mr. Nourish for...
giving me the chance
to play the role of a star designer.
I guess the game picked up
on my ambition to be like you.
Allegra, you were so good
in that role that...
I suspect it won't be long before PilgrImage
is after you to sign a designing contract.
And, uh, maybe you should bring along
your friend Ted here, Mr. Pikul.
He's obviously pretty good
in a crisis,
and when you're designing games,
there's plenty of those.
I guess you could all tell that Pikul and
I had a relationship prior to coming here.
- We really do like to play together.
- We do.
But, I'd just like to assure everybody
here that Allegra wouldn't really...
jump into bed with a security guard...
unless he were me.
Well, uh, what do we have
to say to our brilliant,
award-winning game designer,
Yevgeny Nourish?
Does he have another winner
on his hands or not?
Merle, I was very disturbed
by the game we just played.
- What do you mean?
- It had a very strong,
very real
anti-game theme.
I mean, it began with the attempted
assassination of a game designer.
Really? That's-
That's very creative.
On second thought, I-I see
what you mean. It does make me nervous.
You think this-this must have
come from one of our game players?
Well, it sure didn't
come from me.
Let's probe it when we do
the focus group.
Thank you
for looking after my dog.
Hi.
We just wanted to ask Mr. Nourish
some questions away from the others.
- Yeah.
- Sure. Shoot.
As long as you don't ask me
to fill in your questionnaires.
We've played your game now, so we can
finally agree with the others...
that you are indeed
the world's greatest game artist.
We weren't sure... before.
- Well, thanks so much.
- Yevgeny?
Don't you think you should have to
suffer for all the harm you've done...
and intend to do
to the human race?
- What?
- Yes.
Don't you think the world's greatest
game artist ought to be punished...
for the most effective
deforming of reality?
I- I don't think this is very- Guys,
can you come over here right now, please?
Death to the demon,
Yevgeny Nourish!
Death to PilgrImage!
Death to transCendenZ!
No. No. No. No.
You don't have to shoot me.
Hey, tell me the truth.
Are we still in the game?
