What do you carry to me?
Where will you carry me to?
Children building castles
in the sand in my town
Children
A band's playing
A band's playing
tomorrow night in my town
They're called the... the Soron...
Ladies have babies
That's how it works
Lady in the red coat,
what are you doing with that bag?
Lady in the blue coat, do you
know the lady in the red coat?
Slowly!
Little boxes
Take me away
From these little boxes
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh. Hi.
Just in time. I made a casserole.
No, thanks. I've got
an idea for a song.
How was work?
It was good. I've just...
before I forget it.
OK, idea for a song in A minor.
Possible title, "Suburbia".
I dream of an angel
Down to E in the bass.
To take me away
To G.
Take me away
C.
From these little boxes
Back to A.
I dream of an angel
Up there.
To take me away
Oh, fuck!
That's Madness.
Fucking Madness song.
Er... But not Johnston or Harman.
'So how would you describe the...
how would you describe your music?'
'Thank you for your
enquiry, Anthony.'
'That's a fucking boring question.
'I would describe our
sound as fucking happy.'
- Let him speak!
- Fuck you!
Cheese and ham panini. There you go.
'Cheese and ham panini.
'Hashtag livin' the dream.'
'Yeah, that's him.'
'Hello, sir.
'Talk to you over here, sir.'
'Look what you've made me become!'
I'm gonna do it! I mean it!
This is your fault! This is all on you!
Get out of the water.
We were at this radio station.
He and Clara had a disagreement.
Or... I don't know,
I guess a physical fight.
You're the S...
You're playing tonight.
How? Our keyboardist is
trying to drown himself.
I play keyboards.
She's wanted this from the start!
No, no. I wasn't... that wasn't a...
Red hair. OK.
You play C, F and G?
- Yeah.
- You're in.
Really?
So what shall we do now?
Shall we run through the songs?
Stage door, 9:00pm tonight.
OK. Let me give you my number.
- Is he gonna be OK?
- He'll be fine.
He'll still need to spend the
night in hospital, though?
He's swallowed a lot of sea water.
He'll have to have his stomach pumped.
Hello?
In the soup
Ginger crouton
Cover him in grease
Raw limby sausage
Bobbing poulet
Salted joints
Tuna in brine
Deep dark swell anoints
Undertow the broken Ford
Back to garage help him, Lord
Eels are jellied, bloated belly
Scallops seared, wrinkled skin
Comb the cockles from his
beard Notify the next of kin
Push the baby, cut the cord
Spread the feast upon the board
Coming out, emerging
What happened?
You just stopped playing.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stopped playing?
Bullshit!
This is just bullshit!
Fucking bullshit!
It's OK, come on.
Start up the car.
Hello?
'Lucas has been sectioned and
we need a new keyboard player.
'Frank said, "Remember
that grateful-looking boy
who jumped on stage
last week uninvited?"'
I wasn't uninvited.
'Frank said he thought you brought
something cherishable that night.
'But he can sound really
muffled under the head,
'so I thought he said you
brought something perishable.
'You know, like food that
decays easily. Like fish or fruit.'
'So I said, "Come on, man,
anybody can do that."
'So anyways, we're doing this really
major thing over in Ireland. You in?'
Yes.
'Clacket Lane Services,
M25, 5:00pm today.'
'You would not believe what's
happening to me right now.
'Hashtag through the looking glass.'
Hello.
I wasn't sure where to wait. Clacket
Lane's pretty labyrinthine, isn't it?
I was gonna stand by the
Bank of Scotland Cashline.
Next to the RAC
membership stall there.
But, er, I thought I'd be
more visible on the approach.
So I just decided to come
straight... Hello. Oh.
- Frank, scoot over.
- Hi, everybody.
I was just saying to Don that
I didn't know where to stand,
cos I thought that you might
not see me, so, erm...
- I have a certificate.
- This way.
It's an official medical
document. Certificate.
You'll note the official stamp.
It's all legal and above board.
So, what do you think of Frank?
Light me.
- Erm...
- Fucking amazing, isn't he?
Frank, you're on fire.
He lives all the way out there,
man. In the furthest corners.
Fuck, I wanna be Frank.
- Don.
- Yeah?
- The head.
- Smells like sausages.
He never takes it off.
- Never?
- No, never.
- He sleeps in it?
- Yep.
What about eating?
He sucks liquid food through a straw
that he funnels up under the neckline.
Occasionally solids,
but it's not encouraged.
- What kind of liquid food?
- Grownut. It's like a supplement.
- He must have a very bushy beard.
- Not necessarily.
How does he clean his teeth?
Look, Jon, you're just gonna
have to go with this.
OK.
Sorry, it's just...
it's pretty crazy, isn't it?
I know, I know. I understand.
But let me tell you something.
Frank, with all his issues,
is without a doubt
the most 100-percent
sanest cat I've ever met.
- OK.
- Me, on the other hand...
- You seem pretty sane to me.
- Yeah.
But, no, no, I spent a lot of
time in a psychiatric hospital.
I was labelled as
severely mentally ill.
I used to fuck mannequins.
- Right.
- It's a condition.
Here we go.
'Welcome to Ireland.
Remember to drive on the left.'
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.
And everybody out.
Welcome to Vetno.
Our new home.
Don?
- Don!
- Alright.
- You like?
- Impulse response.
- OK, people.
- Excuse me.
How long will we be
staying here for?
Rhythm section shall be
housed in here. Ah, bunks.
It is.
Frank. The master bedroom for you.
Had it customised for
all your requirements.
These are the bathing
accommodations.
We'll have productive seasons here.
- And, Clara, your living quarters.
- Don!
Nice panoramic view
of the lake here.
And, Jon, you and I are
just through here.
- Don.
- Yeah, buddy?
Don. Sorry. I actually told work
that I'd be back on Monday.
- So I was just wondering...
- Why the fuck would you do that?
I thought it was just a gig,
so I've only brought one
pair of pants and a T-shirt.
I'll be staying right here
in the green trailer.
So if you need anything at
night, you know, sugar, milk,
if you freak out,
you just come a-knocking.
Well, come on, chop chop.
- That's alpine cedar. Nice.
- Don.
- Yeah?
- How long are we staying here?
Just as long as it takes
to record the album, Jon.
'Vetno, Ireland.
'After several days of what
Frank calls fieldwork,
'rehearsals proper have begun.'
'I'm settling into my new life
'and gradually getting to know
my fellow band members.'
Wow, this is beautiful.
What do you call it?
Stay away from my fucking Theremin.
'A few teething problems,
as you would expect,
'but beginning to feel
like one of the gang.'
So... I do not know why Frank
asked you to join the group...
but I'm not at all convinced.
You disgust me.
'At Vetno, there's already a
palpable sense of free expression
'and I can't wait to dive
into the creative maelstrom.'
OK, everybody. Next time
round go to G minor. OK?
One, two, three, four.
Fucking major. Major!
'But of course, I shall have
to earn my place in the band.
'At the heart of it all is Frank.
'How to describe Frank?
'Mostly he seems friendly.
Though sometimes a little intense.'
- It'll be worth it!
- Stop, Frank!
It'll be worth it!
'He can hide himself
away for days at a time.
'What goes on inside that head...
inside that head?'
Yes, it's like an aviary.
You're birds. Baraque.
You're a cormorant.
Nana, moorhen.
Clara, the owl. Night hunter.
Silent killer.
What have we got here?
Lay an egg for me, little
ginger bird. Lay an egg.
'Frank says he must push
us to our furthest corners
'and unlock the great
music that hides there.'
Squat.
Go on, lay an egg. Get that egg out.
Squeeze that egg out.
'It can feel a little
overwhelming at times.'
'But all in all, I am happy
to be a part of this.'
'Just happy.'
- I don't wanna be me!
- Go back inside! Please.
I don't wanna be me! Frank,
just let me go! I don't wanna live!
Don't let him get to the lake!
Don't let him get to the lake!
I'm free!
- I'm free!
- Wait, Don.
- Oh.
- Don, don't get up.
Did he tell you about
the mannequins?
Yeah.
I met one once.
Caroline Cuntley.
- I'm Frank.
- I'm Jon.
- Does he still...?
- No.
He has relationships with real women
now. But it's hard, you know.
He has to convince them to lie
completely still, so, you know.
Hey, don't tell Don I said anything.
- No.
- He might think it a shameful secret.
I say tell everyone everything.
Why cover anything up? Right?
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.
Why do you wear that?
- You think it's weird?
- Kinda.
Well, normal faces are
weird too, you know.
The way they're...
smooth, smooth, smooth.
And then, blah, you know...
all bumpy and holes.
And what are eyes like?
Like a science-fiction movie.
Don't get me started on lips. Like
the edges of a very serious wound.
That's true. But your head
is still sort of intimidating.
Well, underneath I'm giving
you a welcoming smile.
Would it help if I said my
facial expressions out loud?
- Well, maybe.
- Welcoming smile.
Frank.
You've been up all night talking
to the keyboard player?
I'm not just a keyboard player.
I write songs, too.
- You write your own songs?
- Hm-hmm.
I'd love to play some
for you sometime.
I'd really like that.
Big non-threatening grin.
Delighted look.
You're funny.
- Play one now.
- Excellent.
- Not right now. I'm OK.
- No, no.
- I'd love to hear one of your songs.
- I would, too. Go on.
- I don't think so.
- Please.
Hey, guys. Jon,
he writes his own music.
- He's gonna play some for us.
- I...
- Come on.
- Clara.
Share your music with us, Jon.
- Erm...
- Play something!
OK.
I haven't warmed up my hands.
Erm... OK. Erm... er...
That's just...
That's a warm-up. Erm...
I've got one.
I've got one that's like...
I was walking down
the street one day
Thinking about the lady I love
When a guy comes down
and says, "What do you do?"
That's... I haven't finished..
That's shit.
I've got a kind of a rocky one.
La... La...
Lady in the red coat,
what are you doing with that bag?
I've only...
Fuck. You know when
you've got so many songs
and none of them will come out?
Oh, no, I've got one. I've got one.
There's one which is like...
That's yours.
Don.
Hey, buddy.
Oh, man.
- How are you feeling?
- Better.
He's gonna need a chiropractor.
You bummed out?
- A little bit.
- Why?
I don't think I've ever
been able to find my...
core song-writing themes. You know?
You can write a song about anything.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Hey! Like your socks here.
They're pretty original.
Hey, look at this.
This little tuft in the carpet.
I wonder how old he
is in carpet years.
Is it spring and he's the
first to wake, or...
is he old... but still
strong enough...
to keep what winter wants to take?
Lone standing tuft
Defies the foot
Is it luck that
you're still standing?
You've not been flattened too
Do you tremble beneath
the gentle breeze
That's displaced by my shoe?
Lone standing tuft
- Silly.
- Frank, that's amazing.
Flattered grin, followed
by a bashful half-smile.
No. People should know about you.
You should be famous.
You understand.
I understand what?
Understand there are people out
there that might like our music.
Sometimes I think Clara doesn't
care if people like us or not.
- Really?
- It's weird.
It's really weird.
- What is this?
- Potato.
And what is this?
Stew.
You should go home.
Frank picked me. OK?
So it's not up to you.
- Excuse me?
- He said I was cherishable.
And he picked me to join the band.
You are fingers being
told which keys to push.
- I push my own keys.
- Ten little bits of bone and skin.
I'm perfectly capable of going to
my furthest corners and composing.
- Your furthest corners?
- My furthest corners.
Someone needs to punch
you in the face.
Lips pursed together as if
to say, "Enough frivolity."
Today we begin work on
the album in earnest.
'Frank wants us to start
everything from scratch.'
Note the colour-coding.
'He's created an entirely new
musical notation system.'
'...like creamy little galaxies.'
'We've designed our
own instruments.'
'He has initiated a strict
regime of physical exercise.'
Oh, for fuck's sake!
'Fortunately, we have a safe word
for when things get too intense.'
Chinchilla!
'Chinchilla.'
Chinchilla! Chinchilla!
'It's incredible. Frank finds
inspiration in everything.'
I find this inspiring.
'How does he do this?
'If I'm to grow as an artist,
I must see as he sees.'
We could make an album
out of this one sound.
'I dedicate myself to
learning his secret
'and I will not let anybody get in my way,
however desperately they may try.'
Somebody's thinking in the key of C.
Oh, it's me! It's me!
Oh, fuck! Chinchilla!
Keep going! Keep going!
'I am more convinced than
ever that this band,
'whether they realise it or not,
could achieve greatness.
'And I will work to take my
place at its very heart.
'I will show them
what I am capable of.
'I will show them.'
- Hey.
- Psst. Hey, man, what are you doing?
- I'm composing a song.
- Right.
Ooh, ah-ooh
- Yeah, man. I know.
- What?
I know what it feels like to try and
write a song and it just comes out shit.
Here, let me hop in the saddle.
Here's a little love song I wrote
a long, long, long time ago.
The stillness of the winter night
The frozen water's icy skin
Is broken by the boatman's oar
Be still and let me in
Oh, let me in
But stay still
There, see? Shit, too.
But look, Jon, sooner or later
you're gonna get the feeling,
"Why can't I be Frank?"
Or "Maybe I can be Frank."
Jon, there can only be one Frank.
One.
Actually, Don, I think both
our songs were excellent.
Yeah. Right? Come on,
let's go for a walk.
Yeah, I've known Frank was special
since the moment I first saw him.
This nurse was trying to
wrestle his head off.
I mean, the guy must
have weighed 300 pounds.
Frank was freaking out so
hard he just backed off.
- A mental hospital?
- Hmm.
Have you ever seen
him without the head?
God, no.
Maybe he's facially disfigured.
Forced to wear a mask
like the Elephant Man.
Hmm. All I know is that he told
me once he was from Kansas.
- Bluff, Kansas.
- Bluff, Kansas. Sounds dark.
Jacuzzi?
No. Get back to work.
Miserable childhood. Mental illness.
Where do I find that
kind of inspiration?
'Congratulations.
You've made the first step
'towards releasing your creativity
'in a way that will change
every aspect of your life.
'Take everyday
activities like shaving.
'As Edward de Bono once said,
'how often does someone,
using a traditional wet razor,
'stop to consider whether
instead of moving the razor,
'it might be easier to keep the razor
still and simply move the face?'
What is that?
I think it's called
The Idiot Shriek.
It's beautiful.
- Such pain.
- Hey.
- Such emptiness.
- Hey!
Someone's at the door.
What?
Easy, Don.
Start again. From the beginning.
Patient smile.
Stop saying your facial expressions.
It's extremely annoying.
- Sorry.
- We've run out of time.
We've spent all of our rent money
and the landlord gave us
30 days' notice to leave.
And we didn't leave.
So now they've rented Vetno
to a family of holidaymakers...
who are right over there.
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I didn't wanna disappoint you.
We haven't recorded a note.
- I know.
- I can pay.
What?
When my grandfather died,
I inherited money.
He said it was my nest egg.
He said I should only ever spend my
nest egg on something really important.
I want you guys to have my nest egg.
- Oh, Jon.
- Thank you.
Oh, ginger bird.
It'll buy us enough time
to make the album.
What are you doing
in our holiday home?
What are you saying to each other?
Shit. What do we do about them?
I'm terribly sorry to
inconvenience you.
Come. Let us walk together outside.
Bye. Thank you.
Thank you for this new
truth in my soul.
Fucking crazy lady.
'It's been a long time since
I've written anything.
'We've been working on the new
music for 14 hours a day for...
'...11 months now.
'It has not been easy.'
Again.
'None of us has left Vetno
since we got here.'
Again.
'Frank refuses to record the album
'until we have perfected
each and every detail.
- 'He can be pitiless.'
- Again!
Merge!
'My nest egg has been depleted
a lot more than I anticipated.
'We've had to start
rationing the food.'
Fuck off.
'And on top of all this,
Clara's hatred of me...'
Thief!
'...remains as strong and
as baffling as ever.'
- I want it back.
- Those are my keyboard-playing fingers.
'I'll admit there have been times
when I've considered leaving Vetno.
'But I'm still here.
'And I am glad when I
see how many of you
'continue to join
me on this journey.
'You know, despite all the
hardships I've suffered here...'
Just took a shit.
'...something inside me
is beginning to stir.
'I've come to realise that
this is my Bluff, Kansas.
'That here in Vetno I have
found my abusive childhood.
'My mental hospital.
'That which pushes me...'
Oh, God.
'...to my furthest corners.'
This is really good.
Frank. Frank, I've...
Get right in there.
Dog-leg left, 527 yards to
the centre of the green.
Nobody hits a ball like that.
Get in the hole!
You're the man.
Oh! Oh.
I've written a song.
And goes up.
Yeah.
- Amazing.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- You really think so?
That means the world to me.
Thank you so much.
- Do you mind?
- Please.
OK, so...
Pare that down.
Now go up a half.
Go up a whole.
- Hmm.
- Now go back down.
Oh, I see, yeah.
That's fantastic.
Uh-huh.
- That's excellent.
- Here.
Uh-huh.
- Right?
- Right.
- What were you playing before?
- That was like an F.
You play F there, that'd be shit.
Yeah. Let's make that
stomp a bit more.
Through the portals
Vetno tapes. Take one.
Comet tails
Screeching frequencies
of pulsing infinities
Awake in the hive
Where the sap is collected
The process perfected
The galactic siren sounds
Down the dimensions of
curled-up strings inside the point
Get out of the path
of the king, Mr Laurel
Get out of the path
of the king, Mr Hardy
Regret, get off out
the path of the king
They will not be able to
attend tonight's dinner
The supernova outshone!
Get out of the path of the king
Yeah!
Saddle up
Secure the galactic perimeters
Weak and strong, nuclear bombs
Stab it. Stab it. Stab it.
Now what's together
will soon come apart
When it's all over
No back to the start
Don?
We're done.
Frank.
- Get the rope off!
- I don't know how!
Bye, Don.
You were the best keyboard
player we ever had.
The best man I ever knew.
Don used to be the keyboard player?
First it was Don, then it was Lucas.
Now it's you.
Jon, what the fuck are you doing?
'It's what Don would want.'
So you've been posting
videos of us online?
That's not the point.
Because of those clips, we've been
offered a really fucking important gig.
You've been spying on us.
South by Southwest.
In Texas. It's very prestigious.
They've got a New Discoveries strand.
That's ridiculous. Come on, Frank.
Let's get you cleaned up.
Why does it say 2-3-7-5-1
at the bottom?
That's the number of people
who've watched the clip.
2-3-7-5-1 people are
interested in us?
Come on, Frank.
- It's like magic.
- I told you we could be big.
Can't see anything in this
fucking... fucking place.
What game are you playing?
Filling Frank's head with
these bullshit ideas.
I can't hear you over the
sound of the bubbles.
Fuck! How the fuck...
You pressed full-bubble-strength.
They're on a timer.
You've just restarted.
Leave Frank alone.
I know you want me to end
up like Don or Lucas,
but that's not gonna be my role...
You are a mediocre child.
- Excuse me?
- An infection.
- You keep him locked up like...
- Bindweed, chickweed...
- You're like Josef...
- Absence. Absence.
What's his fucking name?
Josef Fritzl!
- Middle management!
- Cunt!
Oh, fucking hell! Oh, fucking hell!
Oh, God! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Oh, fuck!
I'm fucking dying...
This is gonna be awkward.
What is?
Us. You know... together.
We will never be together.
- Oh.
- I find you...
disgusting.
Hmm.
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, OK. I get the point.
Clara...
What does he look like?
I don't know.
Was it awful in the
mental hospital, Clara?
- How should I know?
- I assumed you were mentally ill.
- You did?
- Hm-hmm.
Oh.
So why are you so against
us finding an audience
if it's not because
you're mentally ill?
You're in love with Frank.
You love him and you're scared that if
other people love him, you'll lose him.
And one day I'll take off my
glasses and he'll really see me...
and we'll do big kisses.
That's really how you think?
Don't presume to
tell me how I think.
If you fuck everything up
in America, I'll stab you.
It's just like Paris,
Texas, isn't it?
It's definitely...
- What are you looking for?
- Don.
Hey, Don.
Hey, partner.
I remember you saying
that the desert here
was your favourite place
in the whole world.
After Sea World, San Diego.
I know you were homesick, Don.
And I know there were times when
you wanted to come back here,
but you didn't because of me.
Well, you're home now, Don.
I promise those sacrifices
you made won't be in vain.
Jon has foretold of a night,
some nights from now,
when, thanks to his secret camera,
legions and multitudes
of already adoring fans
shall gather and they shall
receive our music in rapture.
It's Grownut.
Frank, it's Grownut.
Shit, shit...
- I took the wrong box.
- Alright, Don.
- Let's feed the desert with you anyway.
- Oh, Don.
Fucking Grownut!
- Looking good.
- Don't touch me.
- Awesome costumes, guys.
- Thank you. Thank you.
We're playing the Sunshine.
Day after tomorrow.
Frank.
Hello.
Something tells me that you
guys are the Soronprfbs.
- That's us.
- You're Jon?
Yes. Hi.
So, here are the festival passes
and an information pack.
And did Simone pronounce
your name right?
- Jon.
- No, the band's name.
Oh, actually, I don't know.
Clara, how do we pronounce
the band's name?
- Ask him.
- Listen, are you guys hungry?
Er, yeah.
We were gonna go get something to eat.
It's the best pancake house in town.
There's open mike.
It's gonna be awesome.
Awesome. Awesome.
I sit in Tracy's bedroom
In my knee-socks
and Chelsea's beanie
Talking boyfriends,
tongues and weenies
You guys have been
in the forest, so long
all this craziness has to
be kind of overwhelming.
No, we're cool with that.
I'm delighted to be launching
our album here. Delighted look.
This is a most unique and exciting
opportunity you've given us
to finally play in front of people
who actually know and love us.
You know? Until now, our audiences
tend to be people who chance upon us
and realise after a few
minutes they don't like us.
Frank!
I gotta tell you, we
know who you are.
We found you, but the audience
won't have heard of you.
They do not know and love us.
But more than 23,700 people
watched us on YouTube.
23,000 hits on YouTube is nothing.
- They do not know us.
- Yeah, those kind of views...
Maybe one or two people in the
room will know you. Maybe nobody.
Half a million is when
you're onto something big.
- We fucked it up.
- But they're cool, right?
- I mean, they'll like us.
- They'll love you.
Jon? Jon?
'Recent revelations have raised
serious questions in the band
'about the reception we can look
forward to at New Discoveries.'
Lick my ass!
'A hastily arranged warm-up
gig earlier this evening...'
That was shit.
'...did nothing to steady the ship.
'Luckily, I am no longer
the man I was a year ago.
'Now, in crisis, I see
creative possibility.
'Turns out I may be
closer to the Zeitgeist
'than certain people
gave me credit for.
'I'm ready to make my
mark on this band.'
So you want us to change our sound?
We've always demanded
the audience stretch their corners
all the way out to meet ours.
But what if, Frank...
What if we pull our corners
back a little bit?
No, just a tiny, tiny bit. And
then everyone's corners can meet,
you know, in a place that's
still a really long way off.
But it's just a bit less...
You know? And a bit more likable.
- But not in a bad way.
- I'm not playing the fucking ukulele.
Frank.
I'm writing my most
likable song ever.
I've always dreamed
that one day I'd have a band
member who shared my vision
of creating extremely likable music.
So thank you, Jon. You gave
me the little push I needed.
OK, enough chatter. Here it is.
My most likable song ever.
Coca Cola lipstick Ringo
Dance all night, dance all night
I've got dancing legs
I've got dancing legs
They won't stop me dancing, no
They won't stop me dancing
Kiss me, just kiss me
Kiss me, Nefertiti
Just the way you like it
Just the way you like
it Kiss me, kiss me
Lipstick kiss me, lipstick Ringo
That's the way you like it
- This is your most likable song ever?
- Yeah.
- People will love it.
- Actually, actually, Frank,...
I think that we could push
the likability even further.
No way.
You're shitting me. How?
Can I just...?
Erm... Where did you start?
But what if, I don't know,
we regulate it a bit more?
I love it. I love it.
And then if you played an F down here,
that would be good, wouldn't it?
You should be famous.
That's so likable.
Jon fixed it.
I'm officially here. Check me.
Hello. Sorry.
We're igniting the light
and letting it shine.
Hi. Can I get a quick word with you?
We were in the forest like secret
squirrels. Now we're likable.
We're so...
It's gonna be huge.
Jon fixed everything.
You've gotta see us tomorrow night.
I promise nothing bad will happen to you.
- Let's go take a walk.
- I'm incredibly happy to be here.
I'm fine. I'm relaxed.
Forgive me for my problems formerly.
People were liking it. The weight.
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm totally relaxed.
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.
- Frank's not OK.
- What are you talking about?
I need your help to
get him out of here.
He said he's perfectly
fine and relaxed.
I need your help to
get him out of here.
He looks happy to me.
- Whereas you seem...
- I seem what?
Not in control.
Frank?
Have you seen a man
wearing a fake head? No?
Sorry, have you seen a
man wearing a fake head?
A very big head? He and a
lady went around the corner.
Frank. Frank! Frank!
Frank?
- Can you feel my breath?
- Frank.
What the fuck are you doing?
Breathe, breathe. It's OK.
Do you want to come back
to the hotel, Frank?
It's warm there.
Don't listen to her. She's
the one who's nuts. Not you.
Tomorrow night is everything
we've worked for.
- They're ready to love us.
- Can you feel my breath?
They're ready to love you, Frank.
Don't throw that away.
Frank, stay with me.
Thank God.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Are you a little sad?
Yes, Jon, I'm a little bit sad.
Oh, no. Chinchilla! Chin...
- Fuck!
- Frank, he's fucking crazy.
She's stabbed me in the fucking leg!
Get off me!
Frank! Who are you?
'Clara Wagner, our
very own Syd Barrett,
'was arrested today and charged with
assault after stabbing me in the leg.
'See link.
'We will all miss Clara
'and sincerely hope
'our own crazy diamond
'will also shine on.'
Nana, open up. Baraque!
Is he here?
How is he?
He's sleeping.
He's dead?
Asleep.
He's sick.
No, no, he's...
He's just tired.
He'll be alright for tonight.
Not Frank. You.
Sorry?
I've known this since the first
time I saw him on that beach.
He would have drowned Lucas
to take his place in the band.
No, I wouldn't have.
Because when he looks inside himself,
he can't find anything there.
Yes, I can.
So his only hope is to live
off your talent like a tick.
- Sorry?
- Which is why he got rid of Clara.
- Clara chose to stab me.
- We're not playing without Clara.
What? We've got the biggest gig
of our lives in three hours.
The stabbing could not have
come at a better time, Frank.
Everyone at South by Southwest...
Baraque and I have packed.
We're leaving.
No, you can't leave.
We've had 767,328 hits.
Frank, say something.
- 767,918. They're all watching.
- Frank.
- So many people.
- See?
- So many people.
- Don't...
Good luck playing
tonight without a band.
I've got one word for you.
Unplugged! Me on
guitar, you on vocals.
Delegates really like it when bands
go unplugged. Special thing.
- How's your leg?
- It'll be OK.
We set everything up.
Sure you wanna go ahead?
Absolutely.
Igniting the light and
letting it shine.
- Frank, are you OK?
- Uh-huh.
- If I was you guys I'd be so nervous.
- Oh, goes with the territory.
Yeah, but, I mean, playing without
your band after what just happened...
Shit, man, I would be nervous.
It's not like we don't know
the songs or anything.
With that many people,
I would be shitting myself.
- Would you please shut your mouth?
- I'm just saying...
- Where are you going?
- Do my ablutions.
That's not the toilet.
Just be as quick as you can.
- 30 seconds.
- Frank?
- Frank?
- Let's fuck!
Just wait here for
a few seconds, OK?
Hello.
Prepare for rapture!
Yeah!
Hello, South by Southwest!
It's been a crazy 24 hours,
but we're still here,
and we're still the Soronprfbs!
Unplugged.
Chinchilla!
Chinchilla!
- Yeah!
- OK. Here's a little song I wrote.
I hope you like it. This is
the best day of my life.
La la la-la la
Come on, Frank!
La la la-la la
Fuck! Fuck!
Frank. Frank.
Frank!
What is it, Frank?
Frank, come on. What is it?
The music's shit.
The music is shit.
'...Cleveland, Ohio band,
The Gentile Youth,
'had all of Austin
talking last night
'when they played a barnstorming
set at South by Southwest.'
Aren't we supposed to be
playing at South by Southwest?
Frank...
I know you weren't
happy with the music.
So let's work on it together.
Why not?
You're not Clara.
The motel owner says if we haven't
paid in full by the end of the week,
they're throwing us out.
- Fuck's sake!
- Oh, jeepers.
- Fuck.
- It's alright. I'm sorry.
Just leave it. Oh, you stink!
I made it. Now, will you use it?
Take it off.
The head.
Maybe you should take it off.
In cognitive behavioural therapy,
they say... face your fears.
They say, take the head off.
So let's do it.
- Let's take the fucking head off.
- I have a certificate.
I know you have a certificate.
I know you've got a
motherfucking certificate!
Just take it off!
Take it off! Fucking hell!
Frank, I'm sorry! I...
Frank! Frank! No!
Frank! I'm sorry. Come back!
- Where did he go?
- That way.
- Is he injured?
- He was limping.
Did you see his face?
'Yeah, hello. You wanna
report a missing person?'
- Yes.
- 'Name?'
- Frank.
- 'Frank what?'
Just Frank.
'Age?'
Somewhere between 30 and...
50.
'And what does this
person look like?'
Driving me crazy,
but I know who you are.
- Hmm?
- You're the Chinchilla guy, right?
- Hm-hmm.
- Awesome.
And there's the dude with the big head
and the crazy chick. Clara, right?
Dude, you guys are,
like, total myths.
I mean, there's fucking footage
of you everywhere online.
Chinchilla guy!
- Chinchilla guy.
- Chinchilla guy!
See? I mean, all the footage.
You're all totally erratic and
shit, nervous breakdowns.
Chinchilla! People rolling
around on the floor.
I mean, just wayward stuff, man.
And now it's all like, "What happened
to Frank? It's like he just vanished."
- I mean, fucking hilarious.
- I don't think it's hilarious.
Really? I thought it was
supposed to be hilarious.
It's...
But, I mean, Clara and Frank, man.
Come on, they're, like... total freaks.
On top of
Old Smoky
All covered
With snow
I lost my poor lover
By courting too slow
How did you find us?
I saw...
Everything you said was true, Nana.
I ruined everything.
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Frank ran away.
I don't know if...
I was hoping you might
know where he is.
Ain't nobody here
wears no fake head.
OK.
Bluff, Kansas.
Be careful.
Hi.
Frank?
Frank, I'm so ashamed.
I should never have tried to pull
your head off. I don't know...
I'm the tree surgeon. I'm just...
I'm just here to look at the tree.
Can I help you?
I've been very worried about you.
I just wanted to find you to...
make sure you're OK.
How are things without the head?
He had such a beautiful face.
Lovely skin.
The head was my fault.
I made him his first one.
He was 14, said it was
for a costume party.
I did it even though I knew
there wasn't any costume party.
Turns out the worst thing to do with
something like that is to pander to it.
Who knew?
What happened to Frank?
Something must have happened
to him to make him like that.
Nothing happened to him.
He's got a mental illness.
The torment he went through...
to make the great music.
The torment didn't make the music.
He was always musical.
If anything, it slowed him down.
It was a good home.
It's just like my home.
I have to go now, Frank.
- You alright?
- Yeah.
I know I ruined everything.
I'm sorry.
- It's good you're still playing.
- I'm not.
I tried, but...
it doesn't come out good.
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
And keep him company
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
And live by the side of the sea
We'll have parties
on a moonlit isle
And clam bakes
On a coral reef
We'll invite everybody in
And seagulls by the score
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper
I'll polish his lamps
by the light of the day
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
It's really nice... nice to see you.
It's nice to be here.
El Madrid.
I love your wall.
The washrooms smell.
They could be cleaner.
Put your arms around me.
Fiddly digits.
Itchy britches.
Stale beer, fat fucked,
smoked out, cowpoked
Sequinned mountain ladies
I love your wall
Put your arms around me
Fiddly digits, itchy britches
I love you all
I love
You all
Washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner
Stench of cigarettes and stale urea
I love you all
Prodigal son wants to return
to where the dogs play pool
I love you all
I love
You all
Stale beer, fat fucked,
cowpoked, smoked out
Sequinned mountain ladies
I love you all
Put your arms around me
Fiddly digits, itchy britches
I love you all
I love
You all
El Madrid, it's nice to see ya
It's really nice to be here
I love you all
Stale beer, fat fucked
Smoked out, cowpoked
Sequinned mountain ladies
I love you all
Put your arms around me
Fiddly digits, itchy britches
I love you all
I love
You all
Washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner
Stench of cigarettes and stale urea
I love you all
Prodigal son waits to return
To where the dogs play pool
I love you all
I love
You all
Banjaxed and broken
Smashed up in bits
That is the only way
Everything fits
All held together
Spitballs and string
Splinters of wood
On a bird's broken wing
Now what's together
Will soon come apart
When it's all over
No back to the start
Now what's together
Will soon come apart
When it's all over
No back to the start
Lonely little carpet tuft
A twisted woolly Joshua tree
Surrounded by its fallen friends
Alone in a threadbare woven field
Lone standing tuft
Defy the foot
What age are you in carpet years?
Is it spring and you're
the first to wake?
Or are you old but
still strong enough
To keep what winter wants to take?
Lone standing tuft
Defy the foot
Is it luck that
you're still standing
And you've not been flattened too?
Do you tremble in the little wind
That's squeezed out by my shoe?
Lone standing tuft
Defy the foot
Has your tuftiness mutated so
Your strands are made of steel?
Is it sheer determination
You'll never bend beneath the heel?
Lone standing tuft
Defy the foot
