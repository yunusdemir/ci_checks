So, what have we got?
Well, what we know is
it's a woman, americana.
Una gringa.
Sl, senor.
I caught her outside the church.
We have the weapon.
Oh, good.
We have a man in the hospital.
El pobre.
Poor guy.
And you have her back here?
Yeah.
Here she is.
Senora crawford.
The name is alston.
Martha alston.
Cigarette?
I don't smoke.
You wanna tell us about it?
Uh, miss alston,
How does a woman like you
wind up doing someth ing like th is?
I don't know.
All i know is i was
31 and still single.
Uh-Huh.
Go on.
And my sister was 25
and getting married.
Â™ª come with me â™ª
It was a beautiful wedding.
Really.
I was really happy for her,
and i was havin' a great time.
Â™ª to the sea â™ª
That is, until all
the pressure started.
Well, i guess it
won't be long
Before we're shopping
for baby clothes.
Mom, they just got married.
And you'll be next.
Gee, mom, did you just find out
you had a year to live or someth in'?
Come on, jan.
Give the kid a break.
She's got a lot
going on in her life.
She's bright, she's beautiful,
She's got a great job, and
we're very proud of her.
- Thanks, dad.
- Sure, honey.
So are you seeing anyone?
All right.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Look at ann ie.
The one on the end is kinda cute.
He looks like jerry.
The one that cried the first time
you made love.
That was great.
Then i found out he
cried every time.
You know, men should be
requ ired by law
To admit what's wrong with them
on the first date.
Yeah.
Don't worry, martha.
You'll be the next one.
Okay, aunt belinda.
Thank you.
Oh.
She's drunk.
That is my 37th
"don't-Worry-You'll-Be-Next" ton ight.
What is all th is about pressuring
single people to get married?
I was married, and believe me,
marriage is its own living hell.
Look at them.
They're so happy and in love.
Â™ª the sea of love â™ª
Â™ª i want to tell you â™ª
That is beautiful.
Yeah.
I give it a year.
Â™ª just how much i love you â™ª
Come on.
One day we'll have that.
You honestly believe that?
I do.
I really do.
On my good days.
Â™ª i want to tell you â™ª
And if it doesn't happen,
so what, you know?
I mean, i have a great life.
I'll be fine.
I'm gonna stop looking, 'cause
that's when it happens anyway,
When you're not looking.
Yeah.
We should just kick back
and let it happen,
If it's supposed to.
As a matter of fact, let's forget
the word "marriage" even exists.
Good idea.
At a wedding, forget
the word "marriage."
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
She's about to throw the bouquet!
Oh!
Hurry!
Qu ickly!
We gotta catch it!
Okay, so i didn't catch
the bouquet,
And i didn't really care.
I didn't, until it
was valentine's day,
The lamest day on
a single girl's calendar.
I worked on one of those
early-Morn ing shows.
You know, the whole point is,
they've had their caffeine
But ya haven't had yours.
Anyway, that was the day
that it happened.
That was the day i met h im.
I've said it before.
I'll say it again.
Regis and kath ie lee, look out.
E-Flat in ten seconds.
Okay.
We got six seconds left.
Yeah, you're a man who counts, marty.
H i, san diego!
Good morn ing, everyone.
We've got qu ite a love day
show for you.
One of your favorite
celebrity couples,
Mr. And mrs. Casey kasem
will be renewing their vows live...
Going good.
As always, dick's hair plugs
are mesmerizing.
Girl, leave h im alone.
Lunch?
Yeah.
Hey, missy, would you get sam tony
from perpetual artists
On the phone for me, please?
Just as soon as i put these
fabulous roses in some water.
They're from my fiance.
Do you want me to put some
in your office?
I'm sure my fiance wouldn't mind.
No, that's okay.
That's...you know, i'll just
call mr. Tony myself.
Super.
Yeah, that'll give you a chance
to put those fabulous flowers
In the vase, the ones
from your fiance.
Okay.
There's no need to yell.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Â™ª forever, my darling â™ª
Â™ª our love will be true â™ª
May i present mrs. Casey kasem.
Isn't she beautiful?
Â™ª my love with you â™ª
Yeah.
Okay.
Could you just leave a message
for mr. Tony, then?
It's about the mayberry,
r.F.D retrospective.
We have gomer, but
we still need goober.
Yeah. Okay.
Bye-Bye.
- Hey.

I got everyth ing from
the video library for th is, uh,
Tribute to famous
wh ite house pets.
There's some great footage of
h illary giving socks the cat a bath.
Oh, thanks, walter.
That'll be a big help.
And one more th ing.
For you.
Aren't you sweet?
Where'd you get that,
missy's desk?
Happy valentine's day.
Oh, thanks.
You look great today.
- You say that every day.
- Well, someone should.
Oh, you're sweet.
Sweet boy.
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
Come on.
You know, there is a time
for a hug to end.
Ya hug and then ya break.
Come on, walter.
You do th is every week.
But i don't do th is.
Oh, don't get on your knees.
Please get up.
Up.
I'm already down here.
Just run with me
for a second here.
Look, it's valentine's day.
Neither one of us has
a very special person
To spend valentine's day with.
I th ink that means someth ing.
Hmm. Right, i agree.
No, i th ink it means that
it's a coincidence,
And besides that,
i have a blind date.
Please get up, walter.
Martha. Guess what.
You're the most wonderful
woman that i've ever known.
Now that i have found you, i'm not
going to let you get away that easily.
I'd like you to know that.
I'd like you to know that people
are now pulling up chairs.
Okay.
Can you sit down, please?
Yeah, he's on h is knees.
Wait.
She's looking.
Thank you.
Walter, it would never work.
Let's just...
let's not complicate th ings.
Yes.
Yeah.
Martha, i have tony on two.

Hey, walter?
We're still on for that humiliating

Aren't we?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, um, and i...

I reorgan ized your
whole rolodex th is morn ing.
My name falls under the w's.
You're the most excellent dude.
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
- I almost wore that.
- Really?
Nope.
My ph ilosophy is,
People are always gonna
need a place to live.
We just have to give
'em a reason to buy.
That's...that's very interesting.
I've always been able to sell.
Alw ays.
Why, i could even sell
an oven to an eskimo.
Do you mean a refrigerator?
Why would they need
a refrigerator?
It was wonderful
meeting you, martha.
Yeah, it was great.
Mmm, you smell so good,
so clean.
Oh, well, i showered yesterday.
Really?
Must be good, strong soap.
Uh, can i french-Kiss you?
N ight.
Â™ª well, there's many
ways a girl will run â™ª
Â™ª when out there huntin' guys â™ª
Â™ª she may wh ile it with the wicked â™ª
Â™ª hang out with the wise â™ª
Â™ª debit for the dollar â™ª
Â™ª make her mission understood â™ª
Â™ª me, i set my sights on
the man who kisses good â™ª
Â™ª say, he don't need to be witty â™ª
Â™ª he don't need to be kind â™ª
Â™ª just gotta know those
places that are so hard to find â™ª
Â™ª and don't have to be pretty â™ª
Â™ª though sometimes that's good â™ª
Â™ª just gotta know where to go â™ª
Â™ª right when he should â™ªâ™ª
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
What, 7:25?
Okay. Thanks.
Hello.
Hello there.

Wow.
Â™ª the moon just waits... â™ª
"Wow"?
I was just gonna play th is song.
I dropped my quarter.
I was lookin' for my quarter.
I love th is song.
It's kinda funny.
Not the song.
The song isn't funny.
The song is sort of a bummer
In a cathartic, sexy,
romantic type of way,
If you know what i mean.
I don't believe i have a clue.
Are you lonesome?
Â™ª the silence of â™ª
No.
Â™ª a falling star â™ª
Â™ª lights up a purple sky â™ª
Â™ª and as i wonder â™ª

Â™ª i'm so lonesome â™ª
Â™ª i could cry â™ª
Â™ª and as i wonder â™ª

And moo goo gai pan?
I don't even know you.
I'm wh itman.
Th is is so funny.
I mean, i never do
anyth ing like th is.
I'm...i'm kinda shy,
actually, so it's, um...
It's hard for me to feel at
ease with people right away.
Well, you're probably
not like those people.
You're different.
Isn't it strange?
I feel like i already know you,
and i don't even know what you do.
Oh, uh i'm an investor.
Like a banker?
Um, no, just
an independent investor.
I write a little also.
Do you?
What?
Poetry.
How wonderful.
Have you been published?
Well, yeah, uh...
I have a book.
Wow.

I would love to see it sometime.
Great.
Oh. Hey.
Look at th is.
It's beautiful.
Yeah.
It is.
What?
I'm...i just...i can't
believe any of th is.
Uh...
Uh, sometimes you have to just
trust what you can't believe.
After all, life is a
synchron icity of chance.
Uh...
I, um...
I just wanna say, uh,
that i'm not...
I-I'm not looking to get
into anyth ing serious,
And i don't know if that's
what...i'm just...i just...
I just can't.
I'm not into, um...
I'm very busy, and, um...
What the hell am i saying?
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
I th ink i'm gonna faint.
I'll catch ya.
What?
Well, i don't know.
It just made me th ink of th is.
You can tell me.
When i was a little girl...
i was about six years old...
I was at home and my
parents were downstairs and, uh,
I look in the window
and there's a clown.
- A clown?
- Yeah.
He was totally happy
and smiling and waving at me,
And i thought he was a special
friend that god had sent to me.
I found out later that
the people next door
Had h ired h im for
their son's birthday
And he got the wrong house.
I know it sounds stupid,
but it meant a lot to me.
It was just so...
So happy and unexpected.
And happy and unexpected
doesn't happen that often, ya know?
Uh-Huh.
Hey, i know.
? Look what you've
done for me?
Â™ª oh, boy, it's poetry â™ª
Â™ª when i see the wind â™ª
Â™ª in your hair â™ªâ™ª
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
These eight-Seed
bagels are good.
Did you get 'em
for valentine's day?
Uh, no.
What did you two do
for valentine's day?
Uh, we had ham.
I had kind of an
interesting valentine's day.
Just a date.
Oh, uh, isn't that n ice?

Wh itman crawford.
Oh, uh, do you th ink

- Later today.
- Really?
Yeah.
He has a surprise planned for me.
He's...he's like that.
What's he do?
He's a poet.
And a very, very successful investor.
Oh.
- When do we get to see h im?
- When do we get to meet h im?
Mom, dad, th is is brand-New.
I just met the guy.
Don't be blowin' th ings
out of proportion.
He's brilliant.
He's handsome.
He's sensitive.
He's passionate.
He's funny.
He's incredibly sexy.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
- Did you?
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
- Did you?
- Yeah.
Oh!
God, i didn't even react that big.
Yeah.
That is so...all right.
Calm down. They're gonna hear.
Well, there's only
been one serious relationsh ip.
Uh, her name's inga.
- Inga?
- Yeah.
It didn't work out.
How 'bout you?
No, noth ing serious.
Why not?
I don't know.
I spent a lot of time
playing games
And dating other people
who played games.
Honesty is better, isn't it?
Yes.
When you're not serious,
you should say so.
Uh-Huh.
And when you are,
you should say so.
Yep.
Â™ª so now there's somebody new â™ª
Â™ª these dreams
i've been dreaming â™ª
Oh, let's do everyth ing together.
Oh, yeah.
Â™ª you say i'll be fine â™ª
Â™ª it only takes time â™ª
Â™ª somewhere â™ª
Â™ª that may be true â™ª
Â™ª but it's too soon â™ª
Â™ª to tell â™ª
Â™ª ah, it's too soon â™ª
Would you like to hear some
of my poetry?
Â™ª to say â™ª
I would love to.
It's a little late to be
modest, isn't it?
Well, people who live in
glass houses better wear shorts.
Isn't that a saying
or someth ing?
Â™ª too soon to tell â™ª
Â™ª ooh â™ª
Â™ª too soon to tell â™ªâ™ª
"The three-Fingered dawn
creeping slowly over the h ills
"And the footh ills
of one's cerebellum
"Bleeds profusely for the loss
"Of all one believes in.
"Souls unlit by flame,
"Untouched by passion
and unknown by others,
"Transported from one place
"To another...
"Places with in
"And without,
"Places we're
afraid to cry about yet
"Gladly call home like e.T.
"Still, though,
"The sh ip courses on,
"Through the blood-Red,
"Three-Fingered waters,
"Headed homeward
"Like a tired sailor,
"Headed homeward,
"Homeward
Towards love."
That...
That was beautiful.
Wh itman, that...thank you.
Beautiful.
Really, really beautiful.
Thank you.

What do you th ink?
Well, i want you to be yourself.
Really?
Just be myself.

From what you've
told me, ms. Alston,
Th is guy is just your
garden-Variety compulsive type.
Pooh.
I've seen a million of 'em,
But i'll check h im out,
See if there's anyth ing
in h is background
That you should be alarmed about.
Great.
Mm, uh, in the meantime...
In the meantime,
just live your life.
Try not to worry so much.
Thanks, mr. Tramonte.
So i'm really sorry th ings
didn't work out with wh itman.
Well, you win some,
you lose some.
Yeah. I'm really sorry about that.
Really sorry.
You sound so genu ine.
Thank you for your concern.
- That's what friends are for.
- Aren't they?
- Damn shame.
- Okay.
That's enough of that, okay?
You know, i checked out
th is opera we're about to see.
- Mm-Hmm?
- Mm-Hmm.
Turns out it's the touch ing
story of a young servant
Who goes through all these changes
over th is older, rich master guy's
Would-Be girlfriend,
But the young guy ends up with
her in the end, oddly enough.
Hmm.
So it turns out
that the whole th ing
Could've been avoided
if she just...
Not that th is resembles
your life in any way.
Sure.
Then we wouldn't be here,
would we?
There would be no opera,
so it's good that...
Who wouldn't...shh.
That's enough.
It's starting.
You look terrific.
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Th is is even better than
that padres game we went to.
Thanks for not bringing
that beach ball.
That would've been
embarrassing.
Excuse me.
Oh, i saw a souven ir stand

Say hello to mama, kids.
Hola, mama.
That's little n icole,

Aren't they cute?
They're consuela's kids.

We're gonna begin our own family
just as soon as we are married.

That's right.
In six hours, you and i will

Ah, let's get on the road.
Here we go!
Okay, that's it.
Ch ildren, come with, uh, me...

Little jokie?
El joko?
No more questions, little mother.
All right, all right.
Come on.
Let's break it up.
Issues of control
happen when we're tired.
Can't you see, kids, that your
mother is just all worn out?
Don't be like that.
I don't know what you
did to these kids,
But i am gonna find a way out
and take 'em with me.
I am.
You're not gonna get away with th is.
Honey, you don't understand.
Th is family is a legend in the making.
Mm-Hmm.
I mean, just look.
It was an act of fate
that we even met.
Kids?
You wanna hear how
your mother and i met?
Yes, dad.
I was in a bar,
And i played her favorite song.
Hmm.
By accident.
Yeah, h it the wrong
button, but from that point on,
We were on each other
like a couple of weasels.
Moral of that story is,
accidents are the dirt
That legends grow out of.
Huh?
Come on, honey.
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
You look lovely in the clothes
that i picked out for you.
I feel funny.
Do ya?

Into your water.
I thought you might be
a little tense.
Now...oh, that's
noth ing scary, darling,
Just a little mixture
that i came up with:
A little, uh, chamomile
and some, uh, l.S.D.
Okay, that would w...
That would be why i'm
seeing worms on your face.
Kids! We're gettin' close!
All right, dad.
Uh...
So when i...when i was
drinkin' the...the...the...the...
The tea?
You're gettin' in touch

Yes, i a...

Whoa, well, i'll just

And, uh, you could have
dreadlocks like whoopi goldberg.
Did you like that?
I'm gonna be sick.
Well, in sickness
and in health, dea...
No. Whoa.
Now, that's a little...
Come here.
Now, we don't really walk...
Uh, okay.
Oh, uh, kids, kids!

Yeah, i insist.
Come on.
Get on the horse.
Thank god.
Wow, th is is romantic.
Two people separated by chance finally
reun ited, going off into the sunset.
It reminds me of an affair to remember
with cary grant and deborah kerr.
Walter, she can't walk.
She gets run over.
No, but i mean,
uh...all right.
All right.
What about casablanca?
Humphrey bogart, ingrid bergman.
Walter, she leaves h im.
What about gone with the wind?
He leaves her.
Aah.
What, uh...
What movie ends with two people
ridin' off in the sunset?
Don't worry about it.
It doesn't matter, walter.
You know why?
Why?
Because the sun sets in the west,
And we're supposed to be
heading north towards the border.
Oh, yeah.
Well, can't we just turn
right when the lights go out?
- I mean, th is is kinda n ice.
- Yeah, it is n ice.
Blinding, but it's n ice.
Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

Â™ªâ™ªâ™ª
Â™ª too many broken hearts

Â™ª you lay your bets and
then you pay the price â™ª
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª
Â™ª commun ication is the problem
to be answered â™ª
Â™ª you've got a number and
your hand is on the phone â™ª
Â™ª the weather's turned and
all the lines are down â™ª
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª
Â™ª like walkin' in the rain
and the snow â™ª
Â™ª and there's nowhere to go â™ª
Â™ª and you're feelin' like

Â™ª you th ink you're gonna break up â™ª
Â™ª then he says he wants to make up â™ª
Â™ª ooh, you had me crawlin' â™ª
Â™ª on the floor â™ª
Â™ª a compromise would
surely help the situation â™ª
Â™ª agree to disagree
we've disagreed before â™ª
Â™ª well, after all it's
just a compromise â™ª
Â™ª of the th ings we do for love â™ª
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª
Â™ª the th ings we do for love, oh â™ª
Â™ª the th ings we do for love â™ª
