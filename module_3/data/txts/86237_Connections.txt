Would you do me a favor?
I'd like to stop talking for a minute,
and when I do, take a look
at the room you're in,
and above all, at the man-made
objects in that room
that surround you:
the television set,
the lights, the phone, and so on;
and ask yourself
what those objects do
to your life, just because they're there.
Go ahead.
Well, that is what this series
is going to be all about.
It's about the things that surround you
in the modern world.
And just because they're there,
shaped the way you think,
and behave,
and why they exist
in the form they do,
and who or what
was responsible for them
existing at all.
The search for those clues
will take us all over the world,
and 12,000 years into the past,
because it's in those strange places,
and in those long-gone centuries
that the secret of the modern world lies,
and you'd never believe
the extraordinary things
that led us being the way we are today.
Things like for instance,
why a 16th century doctor
at the court of Queen Elizabeth
did something
that made it possible for you
to watch this screen, now.
Or the fact that,
because 18th century merchants
were worried about ships' bottoms,
you have nylon to wear.
Or why a group of French monks
and their involvement
with sheep rearing
helped to give the modern world,
the computer.
Or what medieval Europeans
did with their fire in winter,
that lead to motorcar manufacture.
The story of the events and the people,
who over centuries,
came together to bring us in
from the cold,
and to wrap us
in a warm blanket of technology,
infiltrates every aspect of our lives.
It's become a life support system,
without which we can't survive,
and yet, how much of it
do we understand?
Do I bother myself
with the reality of what happens
when I get into a big steel box,
press the button, and rise into the sky?
Of course, I don't.
I take going up in the world like that,
for granted.
We all do, and
as the years of the 20th century
have gone by,
the things we take for granted
are multiplied way beyond
the ability of any individual
to understand, in a lifetime.
The things around us,
the man-made inventions
we provide ourselves with,
are like a vast network;
each part of which is interdependent
with all the others.
I mean, cross the road;
whether or not
a car coming around
the corner knocks you down,
may have something to do with
the person you've never met,
fitting the brakes correctly.
Change anything in that network,
and the effects spread
like ripples on a pond.
And all the things in that network
have become so specialized,
that only the people
involved in making them
understand them.
I don't mean use them;
anybody can use them.
Down there, is one of the biggest,
most complex cities in the world;
full of people, using things as if
they understood them,
and sometimes,
not even knowing they're doing it.
New York City;
like all the other major
high-density population centers,
scattered across the earth,
is a technology island.
It can neither feed,
nor clothe, nor house,
nor warm its inhabitants,
without supplies from outside.
Without those supplies,
the entire massive structure,
and the teeming millions it encloses,
would die.
And yet, in cities everywhere,
we act as if that were not so.
We have no choice.
The pace of life in New York
is set by the pace of
the technology that serves it.
You just have to hope
it'll stay that way.
I'd like you to meet a few people
who were in or near New York City,
on a November evening,
over a decade ago.
And the reason I'd like you
to meet them
is because they all have
one thing in common.
They were all brought to a sudden
and catastrophic realization
of how vulnerable they were;
how dependent on one aspect
of that technological network
I was talking about,
because of what this
did to their lives.
Now, until I was told what 'this' is,
I was no more able
to recognize what it is,
than you are now;
but watch what it did to those people.
And, if you look very carefully,
you'll see evidence of what this does,
in every second of what follows, now.
It's one minute past 5
in the evening;
rush hour in downtown Manhattan.
800,000 people
crowd onto subways;
looking forward to home,
to the end of this journey.
For most of them,
the technology carrying them
doesn't exist.
They take it for granted.
Two minutes past 5,
Kennedy Airport;
the usual evening
departure rate;
passengers with appointments
in New Delhi, London, Tokyo;
appointments they expect to keep,
and 200 planes due to arrive
in the next five hours.
No delays expected.
Three minutes past 5;
at the Energy Control Center
downtown,
nothing special is happening.
It's the standard rush hour condition
in the main control room.
The time of day,
when power consumption
starts to come up to a maximum,
as people head for home
and meals get cooked.
It's cool outside,
after a high of 58;
the temperature's falling
to an expected low of 39,
with a predicted wind chill
factor of 5°.
The energy levels are
more than enough to cope,
even on a chilly November evening.
10 past 5;
Mount Sinai Hospital.
The patient, Ms. Marcana,
is expecting twins.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
May I first say
to my distinguished colleague,
the ambassador from the USSR-
12 minutes past 5;
the UN General Assembly
in session;
the speaker is
President Roosevelt's son.
In their boxes, the interpreters;
the invisible support
structure of the debate,
whatever the language.
At the UN,
that's taken for granted.
In the subway,
Herbert Freedman, a lawyer,
reads his paper on his way
home to suburban Jamaica.
Al Haynik works for
a publisher on Fifth Avenue.
He passes the time
doing a crossword.
Marjorie O'Shawnessy
also works for a publisher,
looking forward to spending
a quiet evening at home.
Steve Beretti,
late, been to a movie.
Bruce Singer,
works in Greenwich Village.
Bill Palmer is a student,
just been playing basketball.
and, Hans Cramer,
insurance broker;
all these people
take the subway every evening.
They expect to get home.
They always do.
5:15 in Kennedy Airport;
at one of the international terminals,
on the board,
Scandinavian Airlines 911.
Scandinavian 911
is on its way into Kennedy.
The pilot is veteran captain,
Carl Lustet.
Kennedy Airport Control,
Scandinavian 911-
weather information, Jenkins,
5,000 feet,
approaching riverhead.
Scandinavian 911, roger;
1221 radio back to the final
runway, 4 right -
A clear moonlit night;
the flight manifests
lists 89 passengers.
Landing lights -
The descent into Kennedy
is so far, uneventful.
It's now 15 minutes
and 30 seconds past 5.
Please fasten your seatbelts.
The runway lights
appeared, two apart.
Okay, nice feeling.
With the next contraction there,
you'll take a deep breath
and push real hard, okay?
The big one's about to start,
take a deep breath and
push real hard, okay?
Push -
At Mount Sinai Hospital,
Ms. Marcana is in labor.
Okay Peter, I think
you can put her to sleep.
The anesthetic
being used at the time
is a mixture of gases,
including one called
cyclopropane.
It's potentially explosive,
but everybody knows that.
Okay, she's fairly sleepy now.
Okay, with the next contraction,
we'll have a little bit of pressure.
All right, look;
she's starting contraction now.
Just a little bit more.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay guys, we've now got a baby.
It's now exactly 16 minutes
and 10 seconds past 5.
One second later,
several hundred miles
north west of New York City,
this did what it was built to do,
with disastrous consequences.
You may have already guessed
what kind of
technological network this is part of;
it's a bit of a power station.
The power station known
as Adam Beck 2,
here at Niagara,
where electricity is generated
by the tremendous power
of falling water.
The water turns turbine blades
that make a shaft spin.
At the top of the shaft are magnets,
and they spin inside
a cylinder up there,
that has copper wire coils
on its inner wall.
The interaction between
the spinning magnets
and the copper coils,
makes electricity;
that's where this comes in.
It's a relay, and its job
is to detect changes
in power going on
to a transmission line;
these up here.
Power flows north along these lines;
and on the particular evening in question,
this relay detected an increase
in power on one of those lines,
that was above a pre-set limit.
When that happened, magnets
set around this metal cup
caused it to rotate,
and that brought this on
to make a contact like this.
That contact was made
on the evening of
November 9th, 1965,
at 16 minutes and 11 seconds past 5.
The effect was to cascade
power off the overloaded line
and on to another,
which overloaded
and tripped the next, until
all five lines going north
had tripped out,
dumping their entire load
onto lines going south.
Within seven seconds,
the tremendous overload
began to take out
generating stations
all over northeastern America,
from Boston to New York,
as the network fell apart.
As each area went,
it overloaded the next.
Within 10 seconds,
the only major system left
was the great energy island
of New York.
As the network fell apart,
links between one energy
center and another, broke.
Instead of 300,000 Kilowatts
coming into New York
to help meet demand,
1.5 million Kilowatts
were draining out of the city
to supply areas now cut off
from the network,
but still connected
like leeches, to
the New York generators.
As the overload hit
the New York generators,
they too began to trip out.
As the lifeblood
of the city drained,
it went into spasm.
At the UN, chaos;
the power to keep the lights on
also served the interpreters.
And without interpreters,
trapped in their darkened boxes,
deprived of access
to the ears of the delegates,
the United Nations was suddenly
and totally disunited,
as completely as if at war.
The city's elevators stopped.
perhaps the subways
were the only technology
that people expected to fail.
Here we go again.
800,000 people
were now deep in the ground,
under New York;
caught in a technology trap,
most of them had never
thought twice about.
As light went, so did the one
in Ms. Marcana's operating field.
Okay, I've got her.
What the hell's going on?
It was now only ten minutes
since the crisis
have been triggered
by the relay at Niagara,
more than 500 miles away.
The generators
continued to trip out;
and at the Kennedy Airport,
the radar screens went blank.
And flight 911 was in trouble.
Flag warning;
switch number 22 ILA -
Okay.
Kennedy Airport -
Yeah, who've we got?
Yeah, John, can you hold it?
I'll take 200 if I can -
What time did it go off?
Started at 21:31 out,
they can't hold on.
By 5:28, the time had come
to protect the system
by deliberately switching
what was left, off.
We shut down those lights
in Brooklyn;
it's the only thing left going.
Ought to kill the supply
in Brooklyn.
Shall we leave that in
or, shut it down?
We've got to shut it down, I guess.
The system operator recommends
shutting down Staten Island,
and that area of -
Over an area of 18 million
square miles,
30 million people
were now in darkness.
John, I've got the chairman
on the phone.
Isolated from each other
in small groups,
millions of people
were still unaware
of the extent of the blackout,
in the subway especially.
People started chatting -
but for the most part,
no one really got into it yet,
because we thought
it was just another
typical rush hour delay.
But it was dark, and that
was kind of uncertain
to be in such a crowd,
but not to be able
to see anybody.
So one of the women
had candles in her bag.
You know, I have some candles;
maybe we can light them.
This abnormal business
of actually talking
to anybody on the subway,
caught on briefly, all over New York.
Let's put some light
on the situation;
it's my birthday anyway.
Anybody feel like singing
'happy birthday' to me?
Make a happy situation
out of a terrible one.
Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you,
happy birthday, dear -
But, while this journey
had taken on a meaning
nobody expected;
so too at the hospital,
at Ms. Marcana's
delivery of twins,
thanks to the anesthetic.
There was then,
a general scurry around
to find flashlights.
And I immediately commanded one,
so I can see
what was happening.
One of the nurses,
whom I shall never forget,
walked into the room,
carrying a lighted candle.
Put the candle out.
Get out of here.
What's going on?
Get out of here.
I'm scared out of my mind,
but especially with
the anesthetic agent,
I had visions of all of us,
the whole place blowing up
in one great conflagration.
The phone system was
the only thing working,
if you could get a number.
I can't see the runway.
And captain Lustet
was learning the full extent
of his predicament.
ILS, the landing aid
that guided him in,
wasn't there anymore.
- and needs to check the radio.
Kennedy Airport Control,
Scandinavian 911,
the ILS went -
The extraordinary thing
in the subways
was that a full hour
into the crisis,
nobody was trying
to escape from the trap.
I just assumed that
something went wrong
with the particular train
that I was riding on.
There was a feeling of
'it's being something
we all just had to wait out together'.
There was nothing anybody
could do about it;
no one knew anything
about anything.
Put yourself in this position;
would you do any different?
Here they were, one hour
into a major disaster,
and still trying to laugh
their way out of it.
People began to be very jovial,
and began to sing
'show me the way to go home'
and everything
that people could think of,
that related to our plight.
At the hospital, darkness
made no difference.
Well, the baby was delivered
without the lights,
because you didn't need
the lights for the delivery.
That's manipulative;
remember, you're reaching up
into the uterus, grabbing a foot,
which is strictly by feel,
erupting the membranes
and you bring the foot down;
the second baby was vigorous,
and we prepared the babies.
There you go;
you're such a pretty girl, yes.
Kennedy Airport,
this is Scandinavian 911.
Captain Lustet had
only a few seconds left
to make his decision.
He was at 2,000 feet,
past the airport,
and heading straight for
Manhattan in the darkness.
There was only one thing
he could do.
Lustet and 200
other jets that night,
landed with the help of radio
working on planes
sitting on the ground.
In the subway,
people were still coping.
About half an hour,
or an hour and a half,
people became very restless.
It was not, not pleasant;
it was not very congenial,
but everybody felt scared.
Never been this late before.
You sit here and wonder and wonder,
and sent nobody down to help us.
Somebody knocked on the window -
After about an hour
and a half of this,
train employees would pass outside,
but not look at us
and not answer us.
When we were banging
on the windows and called out,
they just ignored us.
I think he's a conductor from a train,
but I'm not sure.
Gradually, finally,
people began to realize
where they were;
lost under the ground,
helpless unless help came.
Well, we have a major
power blackout;
it's at least hit the entire city.
Let's all relax;
we'll be trying to get you off
as soon as possible, okay.
I don't know how long
this will take,
it's con Edison
and it affects the entire city.
We have people coming by,
evacuating the trains now,
please relax.
Ms. Marcana found out
what had happened to her,
though not the way she expected.
Ms. Marcana, how's that?
When I woke up and I saw
all the candles
lit around the room,
I thought I was dead.
And there was a priest
standing nearby,
and for a minute there,
I thought he had come
to give me my last rites,
and I was afraid that
all my family knew that I was -
And they came
to light candles for me.
Don't be frightened now;
you're going to be okay.
And finally, as
in all good fairy stories,
it was over.
And exactly 5 hours
after the train stopped,
about 10:30,
the train began to empty
by having all
the passengers walk out
singly upon the catwalk.
A few days later,
people were back
at their daily routine
as if it had never happened;
the night New York
became a trap, forgotten.
This is one of
the more perfect examples
of the kind of technological
trap that we set for ourselves.
The lift, the elevator;
I mean, what is this?
It's a steel box with some buttons in it,
and, maybe, a trapdoor for emergency.
But whoever looks that close;
except when this happens;
where is it?
And even in this situation,
closed in,
with an escape route
that we can't handle,
we behave like many of those
New Yorkers did.
We strike a light and we look around
to see how badly things are.
And, if we find in this case,
an emergency button,
absolutely great; we sit back,
and we wait for help to come.
We wait for technology
to come back and save our lives,
because it's inconceivable
that it won't, isn't it?
I mean, if you admit that,
you've got to admit
that every single day of your life,
in some form or other,
you unconsciously walk yourself
into a technology trap,
because that's the only way to live
in the modern world.
So, you don't admit it; you say,
oh well, in the situation, we'll cope.
But, what happens
when the effects become
widespread, irreversible, devastating?
What happens when,
what little resources
you have to help you cope,
give up; then what?
Well, in all the disaster
scenarios you read,
what happens is
that without power,
technologically based
civilization cracks up rapidly.
Without enough auxiliary power,
and most major cities don't have it,
organization is impossible.
It's every man for himself;
looting and arson follow;
and in a city not prepared
to be a fortress,
supplies run out, fast.
And, however frightening,
the thought
of leaving your technological room,
soon or later,
there is no way to go
but out;
away from the danger.
The minute you decide to move,
you're on your own,
in a way that no modern
20th century city dweller
has ever been, in his life.
And then, the traps begin to close;
to start with,
do you even know where to go
in order to survive?
Did you manage to get a map
before you left?
And if you did, how do you get out;
walk; drive until
you run out of fuel?
Are you ahead of the millions
of other people
pouring down these roads,
trying to do
just what you're trying to do?
And if they catch up with you,
have you got something they need?
And if you have,
can you protect yourself?
Did you bring enough food and drink
to last as long as necessary,
and if you didn't,
where will you get it, steal?
How far out will you have to push on,
until you're far enough out to be safe?
And can you be sure,
that's far enough?
And even, if by some miracle,
you finally make it,
do you know enough
to recognize a place to stop
when you see it?
I mean, what does survival
without technology look like?
There'd be no signs up.
So, let's say that finally,
somewhere far out
into the country,
you come across a place
that looks right.
And, let's say that you've
had the good sense,
and the good luck,
to look for a farm,
because that's where
food comes from, isn't it?
Okay, so it's a farm,
so you decide to stop.
Has anybody got there first?
Or, are the owners still here?
Because you're going
to need shelter
and people don't give
their homes away;
they barricade themselves in.
So, sooner or later,
exhausted and desperate,
you may have to make
the decision to give up
and die or, to make
somebody else give up and die
because they won't
accept you in their home,
voluntarily.
And, what in your comfortable urban life
has ever prepared you
for that decision?
Okay, let's say by some miracle,
the place is empty and it's all yours.
Is there enough food in the house?
How long would it last?
How would you cook it?
Wood fires; are you fit enough
to chop all the wood you need
before winter comes?
If you're lucky, you've got
livestock on the farm.
Great; meat,
but can you slaughter
and bleed and butcher an animal?
Okay, supposing you manage that,
you've got enough meat to eat
until you've eaten all the cows;
but at least you can
start running a farm.
But, it's a modern farm,
remember?
It's mechanized.
There's a gasoline pump,
but it's empty.
So, you can't use- the tractor.
What you need is a horse and cart.
But, when did you last see
a horse and cart
on a modern farm?
And everything else here,
the saw, the power drills,
the light, the sterilizer,
the water supply,
the sewage system, the hoist,
the milking parlor,
the pumps, and everything
on this control panel
demands the one thing
you don't have -
electric power.
Everything on this farm that you found,
doesn't work.
The place is a trap.
But, there's nowhere else to go.
The only way you're going
to survive is
if you find the one thing you need,
to keep on providing the food
you're going to have;
and you don't need a mechanized
version of that thing.
You need the kind,
people haven't used
in a 100 years.
Ah, you need that kind of plough;
you're saved.
Or are you, because
what it comes down to
at this point is this,
can you use a plough?
It's taken a series of miracles
just to get you this far,
and here you are, with
the biggest miracle of all;
a plough, and animals to pull it.
So, maybe after few days
of fumbling around
with the harnesses
and the bits and pieces,
you manage to yoke up the oxen
and plough the land.
And then, and only then, can you say
that you have successfully
escaped the wreckage
of technological civilization,
and lived off the land and survived.
If you know how to use
the furrow, you plough;
I mean, can you tell the difference
between an ear of corn
and a geranium seed?
Do you know when to sow;
whatever it is you think it is?
Do you know when to harvest it,
and eat the bit that you think
isn't poisonous.
I mean, it's no accident
that the chain of events,
triggered off by that relay
in the power station,
back there in Niagara falls,
ends here with the plough.
The relay itself doesn't matter;
I mean,
any one of a million things
could fail and cause
our complex civilization
to collapse for an hour,
for a day, however long;
because that's when
you find out the extent
to which you are reliant on technology,
and don't even know it.
That's when you see that,
it's so interdependent,
you take one thing away
and the whole thing falls down,
leaves you with nothing,
unless you can plough, and survive,
and start the whole process
off again, from scratch.
And, it's no accident that to do that,
you have to have a plough.
Because it was the plough
that triggered everything off,
a long way back in the past,
after a different set of people
also found out
that their comfortable life
was falling apart -
- in a world where events
came to a point
where a fundamentally new way
of life had to be found.
That's exactly what happened
about 12,000 years ago
in maybe four places on the Earth,
Northern India, Syria, Egypt,
and Central America.
It stopped raining and got very hot.
The result of that change in the weather
was to lead to an invention,
that would trigger
the development of a civilization,
that ends with us in the modern world.
Let me explain that.
You see, the high grasslands
started to dry out,
became like this place,
and the plants and the animals
that had sustained the wandering tribes,
started to disappear.
People began to die.
There was only thing
that survivors could do.
Head for water, and so,
down they came,
into the great river valleys.
Here in Egypt,
that river was the Nile
and the Nile was
an extraordinary river.
It rose in two places;
from one, it brought
rotting vegetation;
and from the other, potash.
And any gardener will tell you
what that means.
When it flooded every year,
it dumped compost
and fertilizer onto the land,
and the land bloomed.
Too well.
With easy food, the population
grew to where
not even the Nile
could support it without help.
Faced with starvation,
the river dwellers
tried planting grain by hand.
Not enough.
What solved their problem
was an invention
that triggered off
a series of events,
which ends with us,
in our modern technology trap,
because that invention
was to trigger the beginnings
of civilization.
This is the first great
man-made trigger of change,
the plough; because with it,
you know how much harvest
you're going to get next year,
and because of that,
you know you're going
to be here next year.
And because of that,
you can plan for the future.
And after a while, when you can
produce surplus food,
then, that's when things
really start to move,
in the tiny settlements.
With regular food supplies,
the population explodes.
The village expands.
There are more buildings,
and they're bigger
for bigger families,
and they're more permanent.
You domesticate animals
for their milk
and their meat and their skin,
because they're not there
to hunt anymore.
And, basket weaving and
the twisting of grass to do it,
teaches you how to spin flax,
and that makes linen.
But, it's the grain that causes
the fundamental change,
because with it, you bake the bread
that is the staple diet
on which everybody lives,
and, you learn about ovens,
and about the effects of heat
on mud and brick.
But, above all,
you have to have somewhere
to store the grain surplus,
in pots.
But, there's so much
surplus by now,
you need the pots to be made faster,
and you need them to last longer.
So, the potter's wheel happens;
then comes the problem of,
who does it belong to?
And the only answer
to that is this, writing.
And the very first writing
takes that form,
a name and a symbol
for what's inside this pot,
or a lot of pots,
or an entire village granary.
And so, the little villages
grew with their huts
and their granaries and then,
almost out of nowhere,
it seems, that happened.
The oldest stone building
in the world,
the step pyramid of King Zoser
at Saqqara near Cairo;
built around 2700 B.C.;
instant sophisticated architecture
from mud huts, in one jump.
How did they do it?
Because of what they'd had
to do to feed themselves;
irrigate.
Because the river
flooded every year,
and destroyed landmarks
and then, retreated,
leaving the soil to dry out,
they had to do two things;
find a way of measuring the lands,
so the farmer
got his own fields back,
and a way of channeling
the water away
for use after the flood had gone.
The kind of measurement
you need, to do those things,
involves geometry
and the type of mathematics
a civil engineer uses,
and building canals
teaches you to work stone.
If you know stonework
and geometry and mathematics,
you can build pyramids,
especially if a strong
central government,
that was developed to run
the irrigation schemes
in the first place, tells you to.
If the pharaoh said he wanted
a pointed stone monument,
that's what he got.
Funny thing is, the same drought
that drove everybody
down to the Nile,
also preserved the things
they built, like their tombs,
for thousands of years.
The stuff on the walls
in this tomb for example,
is 4,500 years old;
a kind of cartoon view
of the civilization the plough created.
I mean, look,
here's the irrigation;
here are these people carrying
water pots, you see them?
And, they carry them across
and they pour the water
into a garden
that has wall around it.
And then, over here, look,
there's a fellow
doing a bit of weeding.
There's the plough;
they domesticated oxen;
they tried to domesticate
any animal
that they can get their hands on.
I mean, take a look at this;
animal flat on its back,
tie its back legs,
hang on to its front legs,
stuff food down its throat,
and hope it'll learn to love you.
Didn't get too far with that one;
it was a hyena.
Well, you've got
a growing community,
and plenty of spare food,
and you'll need to protect yourself.
So, making weapons
becomes very important.
And here, on this wall,
is the whole thing
about handling metals.
Look, here are the
'weights and measures' people
checking on how much
metal's going to be used.
Next to them, the furnace men;
you see the way
they're raising the temperature?
They're blowing on these tubes
to create a draft
in the furnace,
to get the temperature high.
Next to them,
here's the molten metal
being poured into a mold,
and here, a fellow's beating it flat.
Okay; you get yourself a kingdom,
you get what you deserve.
You get bureaucrats,
here they are;
the scribes,
writing everything down.
See the pens behind their ears?
In this case,
they're noting taxes.
Here the people coming in
to pay their taxes,
led persuasively,
by the local police.
Here's a policeman,
with the rod of office;
more policemen; here's an
egyptian scruff of the neck;
he obviously doesn't want pay.
If you end up not paying,
they get out their whips,
and they tie you to a pole.
And that's what you get for
not coming up with the money.
So, you have a busy
sophisticated society;
you have to have people
at the top, in charge.
This is the tomb of one of them.
He was a kind of
egyptian chancellor,
responsible directly to the king.
There he is;
his name was Miraluka.
By sometime around 3200 B.C.,
the entire 700-mile
length of the Nile,
from the Mediterranean
to Aswan,
was united and administered
by officials like Miraluka;
each one running what was
called a water province;
a section of
the irrigation network,
and of the river,
under his command.
What held it all together
was the king's magic ability
as a god, to come up year after year,
with an inundation of the Nile,
and to know exactly how high
the waters would go;
of course, it wasn't magic;
it was his astronomers.
They observed that one
particular star, Sirius,
rises just before dawn
on one particular day,
the 17th of July, every year,
and that day is one day
before the flood begins.
They also saw that on average,
the flood itself came
once every 365 days.
Now, you put those two facts together;
the star before dawn and the flood,
and you've got yourself a calendar.
Under the calendar,
you can organize people;
you can give them a date
to do something on.
And, as for the king's
ability to predict
how high the water would go,
well, you record the level
of the flood every year
with a scratch on the wall.
And after a while,
your experience will tell you,
early on, how high the water's
going to be later.
Now in Egypt,
where water is life,
that kind of knowledge
and the ability to control,
gives you the power
to build empires.
These are the great
ancient temples of Karnak,
on the edge of the Nile,
about 450 miles south of Cairo.
They were the center
of egyptian religion,
built in the imperial city of Thebes,
when the egyptian empire
was at its height;
the greatest power in the world,
this was the New York of the time.
The temples were built over
a period of about 2,000 years;
each pharaoh adding his bit,
leaving his name in stone,
to last forever.
Inside the temple domain,
there were 65 towns,
433 gardens and orchards,
400,000 animals,
and it took 80,000 people
just to run the place.
Small wonder
that centuries afterwards,
the Greeks and the Romans came here
and gawked like peasants,
at a civilization
that made their efforts look
like well-dressed mud huts.
It still has that effect today.
You come here, from
the great modern cities;
full of the immense power
of modern technology
at your fingertips; press a button,
turn a switch.
And this place- stops you dead.
And then, just when you think
you've got the measure of Karnak,
you come here at dawn,
to the hall of columns,
one of the most massive
structures ever built,
and anything I was going to say,
isn't enough.
Look at it.
The Egyptians built an empire,
and ran it with
a handful of technology;
the wheel, the irrigation canals,
the loom, the calendar, pen and ink,
some cutting tools, simple metallurgy,
and the plough;
the invention that triggered it all off.
And yet, look how complex
and sophisticated
their civilization was,
and how soon it happened
after that first man-made harvest.
The egyptian plough,
and those of the few other
civilizations that sprang
up around the world
at the same time,
gave us control over nature,
and at the same time,
tide us for good
to the things that we invent,
so that tomorrow
will be better than today.
The Egyptians knew that;
that's why they had gods;
to make sure that
their systems didn't fail.
Karnak was the first
great statement
of what technology could do
with unlimited manpower,
and the approval of the gods.
Ironically, the modern
equivalent lies again,
in the desert.
This time, the nomads
also settled by a river,
a river of oil.
But, what it took the pharaohs
4,000 years to build,
took the Kuwaitis 4,000 days.
What's happened in Kuwait;
the change from a nomadic existence
to being able to buy
and use everything
modern technology has to offer,
has come in much less
than one generation.
Kuwait represents the immense
power of technology
used in a way most of us
have never experienced,
because we've lived
with a kind of change
it can bring,
for more than a 100 years.
Here, it's been focused.
Change has been
instant and total.
Kuwait has suddenly
become like New York,
or any other of the great
urban islands of technology;
totally dependent
on that technology.
Like them, without it,
Kuwait would return to the desert.
Hello?
Hi, how are you?
Hey listen;
I'm coming to spend
my Christmas in New York, okay?
You see how increasingly,
the only way we, in the
advanced industrial nations,
with our bewildering technology
network can survive,
is by selling bewilderment
and dependence on technology
to the rest of the world.
Or is it not bewilderment
and dependence,
but a healthier, wealthier,
better way of living,
than the old way?
And yet, whether or not
you dress up technology
to look local, the technology
network is the same.
And as it spreads,
will it spread the ability
to use machines as we do,
without understanding them.
Somebody said, a few years ago,
about the way our modern world
affects us all,
"If you understand something today,
that means it must already be obsolete."
Or, to put it in another way,
never have so many people
understood so little, about so much.
So, why are we in this position?
Why is our modern industrialized world
the way it is, and
not some different way
with different technology,
doing different things to us?
Well, that's what the rest of this series
is going to look at.
You saw, just now,
the plough and irrigation
kicked us all off.
And, that an invention acts
rather like a trigger,
because once it's there,
it changes the way things are.
And that change stimulates
the production
of another invention,
which in turn,
causes change and so on.
Why those inventions happened
between 6,000 years ago
and now, where they happened
and when they happened,
is a fascinating blend
of accident, genius,
craftsmanship, geography,
religion, war, money, ambition.
Above all, at some point,
everybody is involved
in a business of change,
not just the so-called great men.
Given what they knew, at the time,
and a moderate amount
of what's up here,
I hope to show you
that you or I could have done
just what they did, or come close to it,
because at no time, did an invention
come out of thin air
into somebody's head, like that.
You just had to put a number
of bits and pieces
that were already there, together,
in the right way.
Following the trail of events,
from some point in the past,
to a piece of modern technology,
is rather like a detective story
with you as the detective;
knowing only as much
as the people in the past do,
and like them, having to guess
at what was likely to happen next.
So, the trigger that sets off the first
of those detective stories-
is that.
And I'd like to leave you
with one question
before next time; why does
a modern invention,
that fundamentally affects the lives
of every single human being
on this planet,
begin 2,600 years ago,
with somebody doing this-
