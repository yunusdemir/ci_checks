Hey, what's up?

EMT 1:
Looking good.
Looks like the kid got clocked with that.
He gonna make it?
Got his head stove in pretty good.
- Witnesses?
- Nope.
- He come from in there?
- He's dressed like it.
You let anybody leave?
- I know the job.
- Hey, I'm just doing mine.
Excuse me. Excuse me.


DETECTIVE: Was there anything peculiar?
Any commotions?
Did you see...?

WADE: All right? You just call her
and say what I told you to say.
Hang up the phone.
WADE: You don't worry about my father.
You worry about me.
I'm not gonna argue...

- What?
- How did you get that blood on yourself?
Blood. What blood?
I'm gonna ask you again.
If you give me attitude this time...
...I'm gonna drag you out of here
by your hair.
How did you get that blood on yourself?

It was like...
...he started it...
...and I finished it.
SHAFT:
Mm-hm.
Look, I was razzing the guy.
He couldn't take a joke.
Oh. So you cracked his head open.

- Hey, I can dig it.
- He left all pissed off.
I followed him out to apologize.
Next thing I know,
he's coming at me with a silver bat.
I was defending myself.
Anybody see you?
WADE:
No, officer. It was just me and him out there.
- Do you know who my father is?
- No. Do you?
- Take him out.
OFFICER 1: Let's go.
What's your name?
- Diane Palmieri.
- What'd you see, Diane?
Nothing.
So why you point that guy out to me
when I came in?
I didn't.
- What's that?
- What?
DIANE:
Huh.
- What did you see, Diane?
- Nothing, I swear. I--
It's a zoo in here. And if I'm working,
how can I see anything?
OFFICER 2:
Detective.
We have a potential witness
you should see.
I'll be back in a minute.
Keep her company, okay?
He did it. That racist bastard.
That's the one that did it.
How do you know? Did you see it?
No. He was sitting over there...
<i>...and he was hassling Trey from
the minute we all walked in the door.</i>
MAN:
Right this way. This table over here.
WADE:
Yo!
Excuse me, sir. Yo!
- What's up, man?
- They don't serve no malt liquor here.

No malt liquor, all right?
No. All right?
- All right.
- Okay.
- What the hell's your problem?
- Let's go. I wanna go.
- No. No, we're fine. We're fine, okay?
WOMAN 1: So embarrassing.
TREY:
Don't even worry about it.
All right. Have a seat over here.
- What did your friend Trey do?
- Nothing.
He tried to ignore the guy,
but the bastard just wouldn't let up.
No 40s, no chronic.

And no-- No indo, all right?
<i>Hey. Hey, dog, is you deaf?</i>
- Holler back!
WOMAN 2: What? What an asshole.
You got that, Tupac? All right?
- And then what happened?
- Trey turned the tables on the guy.
What are you doing?
IVY: <i>He took one of these
white napkins and</i> a <i>knife...</i>
<i>...and he poked holes in it.</i>
<i>Then he walked over
to where the guy was sitting.</i>
TREY:
I think you dropped this.
<i>And he dropped it on his head.</i>
Bull's-eye.

<i>And everybody laughed.</i>
MAN 1:
Take that, chump!
<i>I guess that little prick was pissed.</i>
<i>He was embarrassed
that all his friends laughed at him.</i>
Thank you. You can go
and check on your friend now.
EMT 1: Getting a low pulse.
EMT 2: We gotta move.
- We're losing him.
EMT 3: Let's get rolling.
Tell me he is not the primary on this.
-It's his catch, lieu.
- Oh.
Walter Wade, Jr.
You big Walter Wade's son?
- Yes, I am.
- The real estate developer?
- Correct.
- Hm.
- Daddy's a big man, huh?
- Big man.
Big man.
The waitress. She saw it, huh?
So, what you do, motherfucker?
Threaten her?
<i>Heh.</i>
Oh, uh, she had to go to the john.
What the--?
- Where'd she go?
- She left.
Shit!
EMT 1: When we get him on board,
I'm gonna intubate.
EMT 2:
Let's get that defib ready, guys.
EMT 1:
He's starting to seize.
MAN 1: He's having a seizure.
WOMAN: I think he's dying.
- Homeboy's got rhythm, huh?
- What?

Damn it.

Was it something I said?
I think my nose is broke.
EMT 1: I'll clear his airway.
WADE: Excuse me.
- He broke my nose.
EMT 2: He's going fast.
- There's no air exchange.
EMT 3: Come on.
Let's get this thing open.
I can't even get a pulse right now.
EMT 2: Clamp an airway!
REPORTER: There is chaos on the scene...
EMT 1:
Damn, we're losing him!
EMT 4: Son of a bitch!
IVY: Trey!
I've been waiting for this all year.
You are gone from this precinct.
Gone? For what?
CROWD:
Oh!
For that?



His roots in the community
couldn't go deeper.
He has no criminal record.
NICOLI:
Your Honor, the charge is homicide.
Not having done it before
is not an excuse.
Bail is set at $200,000.
MAN 1:
That don't mean shit!

MAN 2:
You're a killer, man!

Fuck you!
Can I get a statement from you?

<i>- Shaft.</i>
WADE: <i>It's Walter Wade.</i>
<i>Thanks for breaking my nose that night.</i>
<i>My lawyer says that's why I got bail...</i>
<i>...and that's precisely why
I'm skiing in Switzerland right now.</i>
<i>See you when I see you, slick.</i>


BOY 1:
Oh, oh.
BOY 2:
Oh, come on, man. You suck.
Shh.

Luger, hurry the fuck up, man.
Come on, you bitch bastard.
Come on, you Billy Bob motherfucker.
Open the goddamn door.
Let's go. Open the fucking door.

Everybody on the fucking ground!
Everybody freeze!

Down on the floor! Now!
Somebody turn that fucking music off!
MAN 6:
Get down on your fucking knees. All right...
...put your hands behind your back.
CARMEN: Shaft, I got one.

MAN 7:
Now you can't speak no fucking English.
I bet you can say "kilo," can't you?
SHAFT: Hey! Hey, goddamn it! Hey!
MAN 8: Come here! Come here!
Don't make me chase you!
You're gonna piss me off!
Stop, goddamn it! Stop!
I told you to stop, damn it!


Throw something else!
Throw something else!
Disperse, motherfuckers! Disperse now!
Come on! Come on!

SHAFT:
Watch your backs, ladies!

I'm gonna fuck you up for making me run!

MAN:
You got me, papa.

Peace, motherfucker.


April Fool, motherfucker.
I told you not to make me run, didn't I?
MAN 1 :
This shit's too tight, yo!
Sit in this car and think about
this ass-whooping you're gonna get.
It's gonna be a long ride to the precinct.
Paraphernalia. Nothing.
MAN 2: Let me call my wife.
LUGER: Shut up, cornbread.
MAN 2: Let me call my girlfriend.
- I said shut the fuck up.
Easy with the braids, man.
What you got
against black men anyway, huh?
CARMEN:
Supposed to be like a factory up there.
ROSELLI:
Must've gotten a heads-up from someone.
My kid's got more
indictable shit under his bed.
These scales 'll get revolved
before we clock out tonight.
- Look at him.
- Who's that?
CARMEN: Peoples Hernandez.
He's the neighborhood alligator.
It's all his play up here.
He's got about a half dozen apartments.
Keeps changing his shit on us
like it's a shell game.
You enjoying the show?
Yo, sprig, let me see the ball.
CARMEN:
Fuck. John, don't do it. Come on.
John, come on. No!
GROVES <i>&</i> ROSELLI: Ha-ha-ha.
- Son of a bitch.
- Good shot.
- Peoples Hernandez, come on down!
Motherfuck.
Yes! Ha-ha-ha.

GROVES: Uh-oh, Shaft. You pissed him off
now. Here come the troops.
This is Egyptian cotton, motherfuck.
Two-twenty thread. This is like half
your shitty-assed paycheck, okay?
Step off, Peoples.
You wouldn't know Egyptian cotton
if Pharaoh himself sent it to you...
...you knock-off wearing motherfucker.
- You best sleep in that vest.
- Oh, there you go, <i>papi.</i>
You're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.
Stay, Lucifer.


This is the only way you can touch me.
You're one pathetic Kentucky-Fried nigga.
- I got some chicken wing for you.
- Uh-uh-uh.
What have we got here?

Concealed weapon.
- The Iceman goeth.
- Goeth for a long time.
Come on. Ha-ha-ha.
Step UP-


OFFICER: On the hop, folks. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

MAN 1: Peoples. Peoples.
MAN 2: Can I get my shoes shined?
MAN 1:
Yeah, you sure can.
Home sweet home, huh?
OFFICER: Stay still, please.
- Yo, Shaft.
I'm gonna put so many lawyers
on your ass...
...you're gonna think
they opened a branch office up there.
Lawyers? Lawyers are for punetas.
- I thought you were gonna smoke me.
- I smoke Camels.
It's not my size.
Yo, when the van comes for these assholes...
...this one gets the busted seat belt.
CROMARTIE: What the hell's he doing here?
Tell me it's something good.
Tell me it ain't one of your dick-arounds.
No. Honest to God, lieu.
I was in fear for my life.
- Yeah, yeah. I know the routine.
- Will you shut the fuck up, cornbread?
SHAFT:
Yo, Luger, what's up with the "cornbread"?
Uh, your problem is what?
Nazis with badges. That's my problem.
Heh. Nazis? Ha, ha.
Oh, you gotta lighten up, Shaft.
I talk like this all the time.
I see your point.
Maybe I should take an ethnic-sensitivity
workshop, huh? Fuck you.
Maybe I should workshop my foot
up your ass. How about that?
How about you pick a color, black or blue?
- Hey, fuck you, Luger.
- How about I make you both, Luger?
ROSELLI: Take it easy.
- Anytime, anywhere.
- Nothing between us but air and opportunity.
- Anytime, anywhere, Shaft.
- Come on, motherfucker. Come on!
- Go, go, go!
Yo, Shaft,
I like the way you handled that, brah.
Shut the fuck up!
Yo, Shaft, you got a call.
Guy says it's urgent.
I think it's the clinic. I believe
the test results may have come back.
Today we find out if I'm your daddy
or the German shepherd.
Ooh. Pretty good. Ha, ha.
SHAFT:
Well, how good is good?
You're kidding me.
Red, if this is another one of your...
Solid info?
One hundred percent solid?
No shit.
Where?
Mm-hm.
All right. I got it. All right. Thanks.
Gotcha.

You ain't got no favors

You done ran all your shits out, baby.

Let's get going.
SHAFT:
How you doing, Richie Rich?
Remember me?
Refresh my memory.
Put them on.
Yeah, what's the dilli? Where we off to?
- Fifteenth Precinct.

Hey, yo,

You know what I mean, that's my man.
Word up. You all right?
Cold, chilly?
You want a jacket or something?


I bet you thought I was sneaking back in.
<i>Crown Heights'. Bed-Stuy!

You look depressed, Shaft. You depressed?
Back away from the car.
Back away from the car.

OFFICER:
You the man, Shaft! You the man!
Yeah, you the man! You the man, Shaft!
You know, bro, I'll be out in an hour.
I don't think so, running man.
You see, the van to central processing
left about five minutes ago...
...and there won't be another one
for hours and hours.
By the time you get downtown,
we're talking overnight in the tombs...
...and they definitely
won't arraign your ass before morning.
It's a shame we didn't get here
a little sooner.
You look depressed, Walter.
You depressed?
Yo, Peops, you still here?
- The seat belt on the van was busted.
- Oh, damn.
It's called habeas corpus, motherfucker.
That mean "due process," for the illiterate.

You mean you forgot already?

<i>--Back in custody tonight
after a two-year flight from justice.</i>
<i>Wade, seen here after
his arraignment in 1998...</i>
<i>...was rearrested by Detective John Shaft...</i>
<i>...as he flew into Westchester
County Airport tonight.</i>
I don't get it.
Why the fuck did he come back?
If it was me, I'd never come back.
Yeah, see, if there ever
was a "but what?" that'd be it.
Come to justice, that kid's old man's
got enough juice here...
...to slip his thumb on the scale
and nobody 'll say nothing.
Mm-mm, mm-mm.
Ain't no fucking way he walks from this.
- No way.
- Really?

Let's roll.
ALICE: Good night.
- Night, all.
Such a cynical motherfucker.
ALICE:
You wanna come home with me tonight?
-It's been a while.
- So, what is it this time?
You just wanna be held,
or you want the ID?
What you think it is?
I want the ID, baby.
And then I wanna be held.
- That's all right with you?
- You know me.
It's my duty to please that booty.
Finish up. Let's go.

Kearney, how's retirement?
Catfish are jumping.
Yeah, I heard you bought a big house
out in Nassau County.
Four-bedroom colonial,
right on the water.
Let me ask you something.
How does a third-rate, pencil-pushing,
apple-stealing, dick-head like you...
...afford a four-bedroom colonial
in Nassau motherfucking County? Huh?
How much they pay you, Kearney?
After working a job uptown for 28 years...
...you know what I like best
about where I live?
How do I say this?
It's a restricted community.
Your Honor, my client did not fly home
5,000 miles to jump bail.
- You mean jump bail again.
RASAAN: No doubt.
He was in the wind for two years, judge.
And if he decides to take off again,
the mood of the people in this city--
RASAAN:
Talk about the people!
TORRES:
We can't risk the possibility...
...of waiting another two years,
another two months, two days, two hours.
The district attorney's office
is ardently opposed to any kind of bail.
- How about no bail?
- Remove that man.
- Get him out of here.
RASAAN: How about no bail?
Hey, back up, son! Back up, son!
Hey, son.
Hey, yo, you gonna get your ass twisted.
You better get off me! Get off me!
Your point is well taken, Mr. Torres.
The defendant is hereby ordered
to surrender his passport to this court.
However, I believe that young Mr. Wade...
...is sincere in his desire
to deal with whatever form of judgment...
...this room deems necessary to deliver.
- Bail is set at one million dollars.
- What?


- No!
FLEMING: Your Honor...
...my client is prepared to post bail.
Oh, no!
MAN:
Goddamn.
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- I'm out. I'm done.
What, are you nuts? Think.
- Come on, John. This is wack.
- Fuck the job!

MAN: Hey, hey! Hey!
- All right, I'm cool. I'm cool.
I quit.
<i>SHAFT".
I remember when I took that job...</i>
...thinking I could fight the good fight
from the inside...
...and you telling me about all the problems.
That color thing.
"Too black for the uniform,
too blue for the brothers."
About how justice
gets tangled up in red tape...
...or just bought off by the green.
You were right.
Fuck that job. Fuck the badge.
I'll get that silver-spoon motherfucker
and I'm gonna get him my own way.
No lawyers, no politics,
no rules, no regulations.
- No pension.
- What?
You're too hot, man.
You gotta step off a bit.

- No. Hell no.

Got is got.
SHAFT:
His ass...

WADE SR.:
I believe we're in pretty good shape on this.
What about the waitress?
Paul, talk to him. Thank you.
The truth is, Walter, we can't find her.
WADE:
This guy is great.
PAUL:
You know why we can't find her?
Because she doesn't want to be found.
Now, do you want to go back to Switzerland
while we try and track her down?
It could take a year, two, 10, maybe never.
Meanwhile, everything
and everyone else is in place.
- I don't believe this.
PAUL: Look.
Even if she does surface,
she is seriously damaged goods.
It's just a roll of the dice, kid.

<i>- I'll</i> roll my own damn dice.
- Now, Walter-- Walter.
- Oh, hello. How are you?
KAREN: Hello, my darling. Mm.
- How was your day?
WADE SR.: Fine.

Well, let me-- Walter. Walter.

Hey, okay.

Located and then what?
That's gonna cost you.
- What am I, a pawnbroker?
- I had it all appraised.
It'll cash out to about 40,000.
- Stole?
-Inherited.
Inherited?
- Forty thousand?
- Uh-huh.
MAN:
Yo, Peoples, it's him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
REPORTER: --has <i>been the subject
of fierce racial demonstration--</i>
- That's you.
- The man's fucking famous.
<i>Hundreds of people
were outside the courthouse Monday...</i>
<i>...protesting the judge's decision
to grant bail.</i>
<i>The case continues to arouse
fierce passions in this city.</i>
<i>The trial is scheduled to begin
in two weeks.</i>
<i>We are, of course,
following this case very closely...</i>
<i>...to bring you the latest developments.</i>

Flaco, Flaco, Flaco,
we got Hollywood right here in the house.


I gotta tell you something.
In this neighborhood,
I am the motherfucking king snake.
I do like this on 181,
three people die on Riverside.
But the thing of it is, you know...
...I go downtown, right,
to take a girl out, show her the sights.
I walk into a restaurant,
my stomach's in a knot...
...my teeth is clenched,
my hands is in fists.
I don't fit in down there.
People look at me, size me up.
So, like, 10 minutes into it,
I can't wait to come back home.
- I'm like a prisoner, you know?
- Okay.
But youuu...
See, I would kill to be you.
Go where you go. Do what you do.
So this is what I propose.
Okay, the jewelry and shit,
go hock the flash, bring me the cash.
I'm not gonna not take it.
But what I really want?
I want you
to start taking me downtown with you.
I want you to start taking me
wherever you go.
You mean, like, hang out together?
"Hang out." That's good.
Take you to, what, Lutece,
the Harvard Club? Ha, ha.
- What the hell are you talking about?
- No, no, no.
When I say "me"...
..."me" is this.

Oh.
Hi.
I want you to front for me, be my face.
Get me some upscale customers.
I would like that very much.
You do that for me,
you get me into your world...
...I do that bitch for you. Word is bond.
Man, you're doing a little bit
too much of your own product.
- What?
WARD: Look, it's 40,000.
I thought it was gonna be more,
but that's what it is.
I mean, if it's really important to you...
...you can tell everybody
you got a rich white boy on a rope.
I really don't care. But <i>entre nous?</i>
No fucking way.
What's up, Peoples? Let me keep this.
You know...
...you took a big risk
coming here all by yourself.
Did I?
- Yo, Peoples, can I keep this?
- No.
- Forty thousand?
- That's what I said.
But this other thing, you can't do for me?
- Not on your life.
- Not on my life?
- Peoples, let me live. Let me keep that ice.
- No.
The man gonna need it
to raise some money.
You drive a hard bargain, Blanquito.
Ha-ha-ha.


TATTOO:
Where the fuck did he go?
Whoa, whoa. Hey!
What is wrong with you,
sneaking around behind me like that?
You wanna die?
- Hey. Come on.
- Get in the car.
<i>TATTOO:
He had this, uh...</i>

Money belt stuffed with rocks.
Peoples tell him to cash it in and...

Done deal.
You talking about Walter Wade,
the white boy, right?

From the television.
I tell you, man,
they're gonna kill that white girl.

What's up?
ROSELLI:
Just getting to know the lay of the land.
- How you doing?
- Yeah, I'm having a conversation here.
The courthouse, man,
that was some rough shit.
Right, right. Sure you're right.
- You sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm cool.

Hey, Shaft, I heard you quit la policia.
So I don't think it's right
I still gotta do this shit any more.
Okay, okay. Okay, Shaft, okay.

PEOPLES:
This guy comes in here...
...he's got his drawers
stuffed with jewelry and he asks me:
"Can you locate somebody?"
And I say yeah, because
he's kind of like a celebrity, you know.
You don't want to say no.
I mean, he's coming to me,
it's all flattering and shit.
But the truth of it is, finding people,
that's not really my, as they say, forte.
So this is what I propose.
You detectives and shit, right?
You detect.
So why don't I subcontract to you?
The guy says the shit'll cash out to
about 2O Gs. He's gonna bring it by tonight.
With you I split it down the middle, 50-50.
Easiest money you'll ever make.
You take half, I take half.
Ten large?
Ten thousand.
Alls you gotta do is tell me where she's at.
- Then what happens?
- Easiest money you'll ever make.

You wanna tell him about Tattoo?
GROVES:
Uh, can I talk to you for a moment?
What?
ROSELLI: Wonder what the market did today.
GROVES: How the fuck should I know?



MAN 1: All the white boys.
MAN 2: Get the fuck out of here!
MAN 1:
No, no, no black people.

I heard you need a job. But this?
Ha-ha-ha.
You know when guys like you
go down for good?
When they get aspirations.
When they try and rise
above their station.
Now, this contract killing thing
you got with Walter Jr.
Do yourself a favor.
You're a two-bit, three-block dope dealer.
Stick to what you know.

PEOPLES:
Stick to what I know? Stick to what I know?
Fuck you, motherfucker. I'm a star.

You ain't shit.
You ain't even a fucking pig no more.
Do you think that makes me
less dangerous or more dangerous?
Now, I see you somewhere
I think you don't belong...
...I will kill you.

Look.
I respect you. I like you.
That why you always wanna fuck me?



Why you flinch?
SHAFT: Ms. Palmieri.
- Wait here.
Motherfuckers!
She didn't see nothing,
and she ain't gonna testify.
- You stay the fuck away from my sister!
ANN: No guns! Take it easy!
She's your sister, huh?
Well, if your sister didn't see anything,
why's she running so hard?
- Just leave her be.
- Wade threaten her again?
- Don't move.
- This is fucking bullshit!
If he threatened her,
I can take care of that.
- Just leave her be.
- Frankie.
- Mikey.
- Ma, go back in the house.
- We just wanna talk to her.
- Yeah, sure, with those guns. Eh, get lost.
What do you think?
- They shot a blank.
- Nothing, right?
GROVES:
Tsk, tsk. Nada.
ROSELLI:
Come on, Shaft. Lead us to that waitress.

CARMEN:
I think we're being tailed.
SHAFT:
Roselli and Groves.
- They're following us?
- They saw me with Tattoo last night.
Now Peoples is probably
paying them to find Diane.
So, yeah, they're following us.
First Walter, Peoples.
Now these two. Heh.
They like to fuck with people, huh?
I guess I'm gonna have to show them
what fucking with people's all about.
WADE:
47th and Fifth.
- What you staring at, bitch?
- Punk-ass!
MAN 1:
You better keep stepping, motherfucker.
MAN 2:
Fucking white boy.
Freeze, mofo,
before I bust a cap in your dome!
Fuck!
- How'd I sound?
- How'd you sound?
"Freeze, mofo,
before I bust a cap in your dome."
Oh, pure Notorious P.l.G.
Thank you, man.
That means a lot coming from you.
SHAFT: How much we get?
LUGER: Hang on, hang on.
You are so damn controlling.
Forty-two thousand. That's a lot of count
for a simple murder around here.
I know cats that'd take out
a whole zip code for that kind of cheese.
No doubt.
Anyways, it's a one-time favor, okay?
I owe you one.
Hey, you still a motherfucking cracker.
You know that, right?
Ah, fuck you, too, cornbread.
I'm out.
<i>PEOPLES".
Well, I gotta tell you...</i>

The wheels are already set in motion.
You know what I'm saying?
You can't just turn off the dogs of war.
Look, I got fucking mugged.
- I have no money.
- I hear you, I hear you, I hear you.

Well, I guess you just
got to earn it back.
Huh?
Ounces are 1,000.
Eight-ball's 200. A gram's 80.
It's all prebagged.
And I tell you like I tell all my boys,
if you cut it any more than it already is...
...you can say goodbye
to repeat customers.
You gotta be shitting me.
You keep coming back,
re-up with me nine or 10 times...
...we should be even-Steven
in about six, eight months.
Is this a fucking joke?

Don't worry about it, you puerco sucio.
Motherfucker, you owe me now,
Mr. Big-Time Shaft.
RASSAN: I tell you, before we get up

I gave the cleaning lady a few years off.
You know, let her get her shit together.
Once I pick some of this shit up,

...everything 'll be just cool.
SHAFT: Goddamn, Rasaan.

Why don't you sit down,

RASAAN:
All right, paisan. Go check on your fratello.
Look, it's just the two of us here.
You saw it, didn't you?
And it's like a big, flat stone
laying on your chest.
You gotta let go of it, Diane.
Trust me on this.
Just let it go.
I was on my break.
<i>I went out front to have a cigarette.</i>
<i>I was out there about 10 minutes.</i>
<i>I see the black kid, Trey, coming out.
He was pissed.</i>
<i>Talking to himself,
like, pacing and cursing.</i>
<i>He didn't see me.</i>
<i>Then, like...</i>
<i>...a minute later the Wade guy comes out.</i>
<i>He doesn't even break stride.</i>
<i>He snatches up this silver,
I don't know, pole.</i>
<i>And the Trey kid turns to him,
and he saw him.</i>
<i>He saw it coming. Just bashes him.</i>
The spray, you know.
Blood.


<i>Then he sees me.</i>
<i>Wade.</i>
<i>I wanted to run. I just--
My legs wouldn't move.</i>
<i>And he comes over and pushes me.</i>

Give me your wallet.
<i>I didn't understand.</i>
Diane Palmieri.
You see that? Huh?
You want a taste of that?
You want a taste?
You're gonna go back inside,

Then you're gonna go home.
Somebody will call you later tonight.
Do you understand me?
<i>I don't even remember going back inside.</i>
I remember talking to you...
...I remember ducking out
the back and going home...
...and I got a call like he said I would.

Very smooth, very...
And the next day I just started running.
I been kind of running ever since.
Okay.
Now here's the good news.
You are about to stop running.
- This trial is gonna--
- You don't get it, do you?
I took money.
Uh--
The man who called me that night,
he offered me $100,000 to get lost.
Half right then, and half after
the disposition of the case. And I said yes.
I took $50,000, and I disappeared.
See, I told myself, I pointed him out to you.
I fingered that son of a bitch,
and I got him arrested.
And I told myself that was enough.
But obviously it wasn't.
I mean, obviously.

I'm so sorry.
These last two years...
...they must've been hell on you.
What?
