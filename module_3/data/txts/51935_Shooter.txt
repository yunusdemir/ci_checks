<i>Previously, on "Shooter"...</i>
<i>Atlas and the Swaggers
have been interlinked</i>
<i>since the beginning.</i>
<i>Brooks killed my father.</i>
You're going to prison,
not the Supreme Court.
Swagger!
I run this country... me.
Not you
and your goddamn cabal.
For decades,
presidents have told me
the very same thing.
<i>Must be Atlas operations HQ.</i>
I came here to take out
the top of the food chain.
<i>Brooks is dead.</i>
There is no Atlas.
- <i>You and I are not finished.</i>
- I never said I was.
An event is imminent,
right here in D.C.
I need you to find out
what it is and stop it.
You'll still have the problem
of these evil forces
- in the shadows.
- Unless you agree
to shoulder the burden.
Sweetheart,
this is the last thing
- I need to do.
- I'm done.
Mary needs
at least one parent.
- Don't give up on us.
- This is just who you are.
You're the man that runs
towards a bomb
and not away from one.
<i>If I'm willing
to make that sacrifice</i>
with my family,
what do you think
I'd be willing to do to yours?
You do anything to them,
your body will hit the ground
before you even hear a gunshot.
There's a 4-4 split
on the court.
Brooks would have
made it 5-4.
- Brooks dies.
- There is no backup nominee.
But 4-3 would still win it
for them.
They're gonna kill
a Supreme Court Justice.
<i>He's been building
a bomb in here.</i>
- <i>What's his target?</i>
- <i>So, who's excited</i>
to go visit
the Supreme Court today?
FBI!
- Evacuate the area!
- The explosion is a diversion
to get the Justices evacuated.
Shit.
Mom! Mom!
- Where you going?
- Supreme Court!
He's gonna pick up
his target there!
Nadine.
Justice, you've been ordered
to evacuate.
Let's go.
I'll go with her.
- I'll go with her.
- I... I'm not gonna be much help
- in a gunfight.
- Then don't get in one.
Bob Lee doesn't need
a second gun,
he needs someone to help him
navigate that building.
Go.
Okay. All right.
- You, too.
- Not a chance.
This way, please.
Move toward the lawn.
This way, this way!
Towards the street, please.
Towards the lawn.
Guys, this way.
This way please.
Not gonna work.
If you try any
eyes-knees-groin,
they're gonna think
you're the terrorist.
The bus was a decoy.
I think the bomber
went this way.
I gotta get in
to this building.
- You have any ideas?
- Yeah, follow me.
Move towards the lawn!
- This way, this way...
- Uh, excuse me, hi.
We need to find, uh,
Henry Van Tassell.
- He's an aide to Justice Stewart.
- Can't do it.
Building's being
evacuated, sir.
Yeah, that's the problem.
He called me
about ten minutes ago
before the bomb went off
He sounded scared; he said
he was in trouble... here.
So, look, do what you gotta do,
we're gonna go look for him.
- Hold on...
- Anybody of value
- has been evacuated okay?
- No, you guys...
Keep the ID!
Keep it, okay?
We're not the bad guys.
Thank you.
It's a big place.
- Where's the judges' chambers?
- This way, this way.
Come on.
Wait, what's that?
Shit...
What happened?
- You okay?
- My head...
- Who did this?
- I didn't get a look at him,
but I need to get
to Justice Gibson.
Why?
I'm her driver.
- This is ridiculous.
- Ma'am?
Think we're outside
the blast radius yet?
Turn around.
I have work to do.
The evacuation protocols
are very clear.
Don't talk to me
about protocol, young man.
Protocol calls
for my regular driver.
Yes, ma'am.
- Where are we going?
- Arlington.
Oh, good.
I can stop by and say hello
to my husband.
I'm not the Queen,
get out of my way.
Ramiro, it's my lucky day.
- Oh, is it?
- How's Dolores?
Oh, she's always worried,
you know.
Drag us out of our office
for nothing.
Okay, so we know
the evac location.
- What's the plan?
- Find a radio and call it in.
Uh, we can't.
Coms are encrypted
during a terrorist event
so nobody can listen in.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?
- Improvising.
- What...
Are you gonna steal
this cop car?
- Yup.
- What do I do?
Report me and tell them
where I went.
Okay.
Subtitles by explosiveskull
- Mr. Johnson.
- Yes.
- Husband?
- Brother.
Okay, uh, she's stable,
but she's in bad shape.
Shrapnel grazed
her carotid artery.
And that's the good news,
'cause three millimeters
to the right
and she would have died.
- She awake?
- Uh, no.
You're... you're welcome to stay.
Uh, or if there's a change,
we can always try to call you,
- but as you can see, it's...
- I'll stay.
All right,
I'll let somebody know.
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey. News?</i>
She's stable now,
but touch-and-go earlier.
Jesus.
Um, I'm on my way.
I gotta walk,
every street is gridlocked.
<i>Looks like the target
was Justice Gibson.</i>
- They get her?
- <i>Not yet.</i>
Bob Lee stole a police car
and is driving it to Arlington.
He wanted me to tell you.
<i>Isaac?</i>
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>
Tell Nadine
I'll see her soon.
Yeah.
What's this for?
Swabbing for anthrax,
Justice Gibson.
My understanding
is it was a bomb, Corpsman.
Just a precaution.
Need your weapon
and your mobile.
I'm responsible
for the Justice's safety.
Not here.
I'm told you can
make personal calls
- from a secure line.
- Who would I call?
I'd rather have a chat
with my colleagues.
Where are we waiting?
Just down the corridor here,
ma'am.
You can stay here.
I'm just going
to go grab some paperwork.
Get into the safe room!
Shit.
Stop.
- Hands up.
- All right.
- I'm SWAT, I'm off-duty.
- ID, now.
Okay, it's in my wallet.
- I'm gonna reach for it.
- Slowly.
This way, please.
Everybody inside.
Wow.
Yeah, okay, now I'm scared.
You don't look so bad
for someone
who got shrapnel in their neck.
You look pretty bad
for someone who didn't.
- How's the kid?
- She's fine.
You saved her.
She's lucky.
Bad shit is always
gonna happen, Nadine.
How we respond to it,
that's what matters.
They killed my wife,
I killed them.
That was the wrong play.
We gotta take this all the way.
I'm not sure
there's anyone left, Isaac.
There's always someone.
So, what, you want
to take on the world?
Yeah.
But in the right way.
You really want
to do this?
Become Atlas?
POTUS practically engraved
the invitation.
Like I told Gregson...
Nature hates a vacuum.
Somebody needs to fill it.
Where's Swagger?
He got a lead.
Justice Gibson.
What...
what are you doing here?
Because if he fails,
they'll be here next.
You're in no condition
to fight.
This reminds me
of that bomb threat
from two years ago.
At least that time
we were locked down
in our chambers.
I hate to say it,
but there are worse places
to die.
I'm proud of the work we do.
Some nutball wants
to silence us,
we must be
doing something right.
I need to see Justice Gibson.
No one in or out
till all-clear.
I'm not asking.
Don't touch him!
Shit.
He's got a suicide vest.
Jesus Christ.
Ramiro, the moment
he opens the door,
he's gonna blow that thing.
I don't think
a fire extinguisher's
gonna help.
It's over.
Atlas is dead!
You're doing this
for nothing, man.
Go, go, go!
Go! Get out of here!
<i>Homeland Security is set
to hold a press conference</i>
<i>at 5:00 to address the atta...</i>
He used to sleep
through mortar attacks
at our base.
At least he doesn't snore.
I see they kept your name
out of it.
Yeah, FBI felt
it would be too confusing.
They went with
the less complicated version.
Hm. Lone nutjob, huh?
There was nothing
to connect him to Atlas.
How are you?
Couple of new battle scars,
but alive.
And grateful.
You still planning
on taking over Atlas?
Not alone.
Ah, the dead rise.
Atlas was a mistake.
But there's always
gonna be someone
- trying to run things.
- Might as well
be the good guys.
Is that you?
I think so.
Any word on Bama?
No, not yet.
- Where's Harris?
- Apparently he started
a new job, and he brought me
flowers earlier.
- Classy.
- And Julie?
- That's where I'm headed next.
- Smart man.
Once you get that squared,
we're accepting resumes.
It's tempting,
but I think I'll pass.
I wanna focus
on saving my marriage
instead of the world.
She'll be happy to see you.
We'll see.
Take care of yourself.
Both of you.
Shit gets weird out there.
Red, thanks for coming.
I didn't come
to see you, pissant.
- Where is he?
- Camp David.
- Asked me to speak with you.
- Did he?
Wanted me to thank you
for your service.
Hmm.
My resignation.
- You gotta be shitting me.
- I'd offer you pancakes,
but pretty sure
the commissary's
- done serving breakfast.
- I want to talk to POTUS, now.
He's spending the weekend
with his wife.
Do-not-disturb kind of thing,
if you know what I mean.
Enjoy your small victory,
Downey.
I'll be back.
That's, uh, Deputy Chief
of Staff Downey, Red.
And I doubt it.
Uh, the president
has actually asked me
to have
the Department of Labor
look into the use
of undocumented immigrants
in meat packing plants.
Specifically, in Texas.
Says they should go back
30 years if they have to.
I will burn this whole place
to the ground, young man.
With what?
Look around, Red.
You don't have
any friends left.
Make sure you leave
your government ID
with the Secret Service
on your way out.
Yeah.
Hey, you're home.
I'm so glad you're safe.
- Where's Mary?
- She's with Anne.
They'll be back later.
She's missed you like crazy.
Yeah, we...
Look, I'm...
I'm glad that you're home,
but we still need to talk.
What is all this?
I don't know what to do.
Baby, I don't want you
to leave.
I know that,
but what about everything
with your dad?
- It's done, it's over.
- Are you sure?
The man who killed my father
is dead.
- And what about Atlas?
- Atlas is finished.
Isaac and Nadine
are working some angle,
but it has nothing
to do with me.
I don't... I don't know how
to trust you anymore.
I just don't.
That's fair.
But before you make
a decision about us,
there is one thing left to do,
and I need you and Mary
by my side to do it.
This would have made Sam
and your daddy both happy.
- I agree.
- Don't you want
to say something?
Kinda think I've said
all I can say, Mouse.
But this is the last time
we're gonna see them.
You're right.
These two men raised me, Mary.
They both taught me
everything I know.
Right from wrong,
good from bad.
I loved and respected
both of them in different ways.
Was Grandpa Earl a good dad?
Like you?
He did the best he could.
Grandpa had a secret...
something that made him
feel bad...
and sometimes that bad feeling
came out as anger.
I never wanted to be that way.
That's over now.
Sam helped bring
my daddy some peace...
and some peace to us too.
You ready?
Okay.
Hey.
Ignore him, all right?
Just give me a minute.
Unless you're here to confess
to arranging my daddy's murder,
you best leave.
I came to tell you
this fight is over.
I'm selling the cattle company
and walking away.
- From all of it.
- Bullshit.
Swagger, you beat me.
I've lost everything
that was ever important to me,
including my son.
- All of it was your choice.
- And so was this.
I'm gone.
I just don't want to spend
the rest of my life waiting
for one of your bullets.
Then leave Texas.
Don't come back.
You don't deserve
to stand on the same ground
my dad's buried in.
- I see you've been busy.
- It is amazing what you can do
with a no-limit Amex.
Signed a lease,
made it official.
What are we calling it?
"Prometheus."
You realize he was tortured
for helping humanity, right?
Thought it fit.
We're gonna need some staff
and a CEO.
- That gonna be you, Captain?
- I do have the experience.
Ah, but, uh,
I have the money.
Okay, so, partners?
Fifty-fifty?
I handle the politics,
you handle the missions.
Works for me.
- What's that?
- No idea.
Anyone else have keys
to this place?
There is no key,
it's digital.
Present from Red?
What is it?
It's the hard drive
from the Atlas campus.
This is a complete record
of everything they ever did.
Holy shit.
Looks like Carlita
made it out after all.
Not sure
if that's good or bad.
Guess we'll find out.
Jules?
- What are you doing, honey?
- Finishing the packing.
Where's Mouse?
She's at Anne's hotel
with her.
- Please, Jules, let's just...
- Look, baby,
- this isn't gonna work, okay?
- Why not?
Because I saw the way
that you looked at Red.
- I know what you want to do.
- Julie, it's over.
- He's leaving town.
- But you don't want it
- do be over, do you?
- Yes, I do!
So you're just gonna
let the man who's responsible
for your father's death
walk away?
Come on, Bob Lee,
you are who you are.
I am still the man
you fell in love with, Julie.
- I haven't changed.
- I have.
I've changed.
So you don't love me anymore.
I will never stop
loving you.
- Then don't leave!
- I just don't
love this anymore.
- It's gonna change, I promise!
- Look, thank you
for saying that,
but we both know
that's not true.
You know that
there is nothing
more important to me
than you and Mary.
Nothing.
I do know that.
But our lives have revolved
around you for so long.
We need a break.
Just a break?
I don't want a divorce.
I don't, but...
I don't know...
we need a reset.
Something.
Then I'll leave.
This is Mary's home.
I wanna know
that the two of you are here.
We'll figure this out, okay?
I'll tell Mary
when she comes home.
No.
I want it to come from me.
I don't want her to think
any of this is your fault.
'Cause it's not.
I'll get my things.
Crazy to think
that a lifetime worth of work
can be undone with a signature.
Cayman accounts set up?
- As instructed.
- Excellent.
Well, then we're done.
Have him come in
the back way, honey.
It might be better
if you left now, Mark.
You have an excellent
reputation, Prosada.
What do they call you
back home in Colombia?
- El Carnicero.
- The Butcher.
I'm a butcher as well...
and when people pay me
for meat, I deliver.
You will have what you desire.
Hundred now,
hundred when it's done.
Split it any way you want.
Just Swagger?
Whoever's there.
No witnesses.
As you wish.
I don't know how long.
You always go away, Dad.
And you always come back.
Yeah.
<i>This time's
a little different.</i>
<i>Mom and Dad
need some time apart.</i>
<i>I'm not going on a mission.</i>
Where are you going?
I'm gonna get a place nearby.
<i>Why?</i>
<i>'Cause we're gonna
live separate</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>
What?
Not... not forever, sweetie.
Just until we get
some things figured out.
'Cause you and Mom
have been fighting?
No.
Not a good time, Sheriff.
You expecting
any VIPs today?
- Why?
- Just clocked
a low-flying helicopter.
Landed not too far
from your ranch.
All right, send everybody
you got to the ranch.
Anne, I need you to take Mary
and get out of here.
- What's going on?
- I think something's up.
Uh, can you just take her
to the Sheriff's office
and wait there?
I'll call you as soon as I can.
Come on, Mary.
We're gonna go run
- a little errand.
- What about Dad?
Uh, I'll see you soon,
sweetheart.
I gotta go check on Mommy,
all right?
Yeah. Come on, sweetheart.
Oh, shit.
<i>This is Julie.
You know what to do.</i>
<i>9-1-1,
what's your emergency?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>
Shit.
<i>9-1-1 says they've got
an open line</i>
<i>at the Swagger ranch.</i>
<i>Sounds like a hell
of a gunfight.</i>
All hands on deck.
Call Testa and have his men
back us up.
Bitch.
You gotta be prepared, <i>puta.</i>
This ain't no bullshit.
Bulletproof.
- Bad luck.
- Is this bulletproof?
- Julie!
- Bob Lee!
Julie!
Bob Lee!
I'm in here!
Baby!
- Are there any more?
- No, just two dead.
Holy shit.
- Good hunting, babe.
- Where's Mary?
She's with Anne
and she's safe.
Let me see that,
let me see.
All right, it went
all the way through.
That's good, that's good.
- You're gonna be okay.
- Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I lost faith in us
and in you.
Come on, don't think
about that right now.
- Bob Lee!
- We're in here, Sheriff!
We need an EMT, but we're okay.
- Hey, make sure we got 'em all.
- Done!
No, no, no,
let's wait for a stretcher.
No, I wanna
get the hell out of here.
Okay, all right.
Let me help you, come here.
You're gonna be okay.
- I'm so sorry, baby.
- It's okay.
It would have been better
if I just left it alone.
My dad let
this life consume him.
I'm not gonna be like that.
I love you, and I love Mary.
This is my life.
I love you too, baby.
- We're all clear, Sheriff.
- God damn.
It was a hell of a day.
- All right...
- No.
- No, your dad's gun.
- I don't care about that.
I do.
No!
No, no!
Julie! No, no, no!
No! God, no!
No!
No, baby, no!
No! Help!
Help!
Help!
Baby, don't leave me.
Don't leave me, baby.
Don't leave me!
Julie...
I'm sorry.
- How'd it go?
- As expected.
Package got delivered.
The new guy did well.
It's gonna take me
the better part of a year
to get through all
this Atlas stuff and undo it.
- Any word from Bob Lee?
- No, he's been off the grid
since Julie's funeral.
Got around-the-clock security
on Mary and the sister-in-law.
- Nothing out of the ordinary.
- He'll resurface, trust me.
Excuse me?
Uh, I have
a Harris Downey here?
Send him in.
What's he want?
No idea.
Want me to stay?
Knowing Harris, he probably
wants to talk
about our relationship.
Yeah, please stay.
Have fun.
Uh...
- "HD."
- Isaac.
- He is still so friendly.
- He is who he is.
It's reliable.
Hi.
So how's
the Deputy Chief of Staff?
Short on time,
especially since, technically,
I'm not even here.
The president's impressed.
He appreciates the way
you cleaned up,
didn't make a thing out of it.
Wanted to know if you'd
take a look at that.
- We're pretty busy.
- The president's asking.
Personally.
- Jesus.
- Christophe Schneizer.
German nationalist.
Isn't it easier
just to say "Nazi"?
Mm.
And why would he
be helping ISIL?
He wants to be Chancellor.
Figures if he makes Merkel
look bad...
You don't need us for this.
You've got the resources
of the entire
Federal government.
I do, and they all
have names and fingerprints.
- Germany's an ally.
- Well, tell the Germans
to deal with it.
Of course.
Then they would know that
you've been spying on them.
I'm glad to see
we can still finish
each other's sentences.
Discretion's paramount.
You look great.
The job suits you.
Harris.
If I do this...
you owe me.
What'd he want?
Just wanted to make sure
we knew the president
- appreciated our work.
- That's it?
- Could have called.
- Eh, what can I say?
He likes me.
I wondered
if you'd find me.
<i>I told you
if you ever touched my family</i>
<i>I would never stop looking.</i>
<i>Don't suppose I can talk you
out of this.</i>
No.
You can't.
