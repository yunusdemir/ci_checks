Excuse me, sir,
is this the right train to New Haven?
- Yeah. Next train on this platform, sir.
- Thanks. - Alright.
- Malcolm, Malcolm.
- Evening, guv.
Uh, right, 11:30, New Haven.
Done and done.
Thank you very much.
APPLICATION FOR SUPERVISOR'S POSITION
- Bad news?
- No.
- Alright. Congratulations.
- Ken called in sick.
- Looks like you're on the Eastborough red-eye.
- Tonight?
Hang on, I've just done my shift.
They must all be law-abiding citizens
on your trains.
You haven't issued
a penalty fare in six weeks.
Or are you just not man enough?
- I'll do it.
- Good boy.
Platform Nine.
- You alright, love?
- Fine.
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.
This is your guard speaking.
I would like to welcome you aboard...
The 2359 Alpha Trax
service to Eastborough,
calling at Moseley Junction, Woolscot,
Edgcombe, Abington Cross, Wychford,
Christchurch, Barrock's Hill, Old Milton
and arriving at Eastborough at 1:48.

I'd like to remind you at this time
to have your tickets ready for inspection.
Thank you.
Tickets, please.
Ta. Lovely.
Thank you, ma'am.
Tickets and passes, please.
Tickets, please.
Good, thank you, sir.
Excuse me madam, tickets?
I'll get that for you.
I've seen an uglier face.
Nasty man.
Tickets, please.
Thank you, ma'am.
What? Oh, Christ.
Hang on.
No rush, you're alright.
That's weird.
I had it this morning.
Today has just been a complete nightmare.
Let's see...
If you don't have a valid pass,
I have to charge the full fare.
What? Seriously?
I take this train every single day.
Those are the rules.
Where is it you're traveling to?
Eastborough.
Eastborough.
That's gonna be £39 then, please.
- Thank you.
- Ta
Apologies.
Just wait for your change.
That's lovely, thank you.
Tickets, please!
Can I see your tickets, please?
Thank you, sir.
Why don't you get a proper job?
OUT OF ORDER
It was so great.
Yeah, the guys, they were so hot.
I'll go tomorrow.
About 12ish, is that alright?
We'll go home, get changed,
and I can wear shorts.
Tickets and passes, please.
Yes, it's really boring.
But the party was amazing in London...
May I see your tickets, please.
It was such a great night. You should've been there.
I know, well, yeah.
Ticket, please?
Yes, very cool.
You can talk elsewhere
in the quiet zone, please.
Miss?
- Are they alright?
- Thank you.
Oh, my God, this guy
is totally staring at my tits.
What can I say? It's not my fault.
It was so funny.
Thank you. Ta.
Tickets, please.
Thank you, sir.
Can I see your ticket, please?
Thank you.
Ticket, please.
- Any coffee?
- Can I your tickets, please.
Chicken?
Hiya.
- Hi, there.
- £1 .85, please.
Didn't realize you were on tonight.
Yeah, double shift.
Trying to save as much as I can this month.
Oh, right. Yeah.
Dave's done the same to me.
You still trying to go?
Uh, I haven't decided yet.
Really don't wanna be serving chicken sandwiches
for the rest of my life.

- No.
- Yes?
Coffee white,
two sugars, please.
And why would you?
Sorry about your promotion.
David told me.
I think he told everyone.
That doesn't surprise me.
It's not the end of the world.
Something else better will come up, I'm sure.
Well, you should try again.
You know, you're good with the passengers.
People like you.
Ell... Ellen...
Do you want to go
for a drink later on?
I don't think anywhere will be open.
Yeah, no, probably, probably not.
I'm on again in the morning, so...
Yeah.
I better get on,
but good luck next time.
Oh, it was just a spur-of-the-moment thing.
Don't worry about it.
I meant with the
supervisor application.
Right.
Need a piss.
Well done. That went well, mate.
This is the driver. Sorry for the bump.
Seems we hit something on the line.
Please remain seated.
We should be on our way shortly.
Thank you.
- You alright?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- That was quite a ride, mate.
- Sorry about that, sir.
- Yeah.
- You alright, Ellen?
- Look at this mess.
- Don't worry about the mess. We'll sort that out.
Yeah. No, I'll do it.
No, no, no. I'll do it.
Allow me.
Thanks.
Any time.
- Are these yours?
- Cheers, yeah.
Mine, too.
Thank you.
Maybe you should
check on the others?
Right, yeah. Okay.
You're both sound, fine?
Yeah, I think we got it covered.
Is everybody alright down here?
Madam, you alright?
- Yes, yes, but what happened?
- Oh my God, have we crashed?
- Did we come off the tracks?
- We're trying to get to the bottom of it.
You should have seat belts
if you wanna stop like that.
I hear what you're saying.
Let me help you with these.
- Okay, Ged, please.
- Did we come off the track?
- Let me take these.
- No, no, I'll do it.
Ged!
Alright, alright.
It's her you wanna worry about.
- Ged.
- Just take a seat for me. Yes, thank you.
- Calm down.
- Miss, you alright?
I've gotta call my mum.
I could have died.
- Are you okay, though?
- If this is broken, I will sue you.
I understand your concern,
but you just need try to calm down.
Don't touch me, pervert!
- Are you alright?
- What do you think?
- You alright, mate?
- Yeah. We going soon, or what?
Yeah, yeah. I'm just waiting
to hear from the driver.
Just take it easy for a minute, please.
You alright down there, sir?
I dropped my book.
Dropped your book.
Sir, here's your book.
Here you go, sir.
Oh, thanks. I've lost my page now.
I'd just got to a good bit as well.
I think you'll be alright, mate.
Just stay there and keep calm, alright.
Driver, this is the guard.
Hello?
Hello?
Ladies and gentlemen,
apologies once again for the delay.
I'm still waiting on word
from the driver.
Thanks for your patience.
Oh, dear.
Come on, sausage.
Come here.
Oh, found my page.
- This is a no smoking train, miss.
- Piss off.
Do you want me
to go out and push?
I don't believe this.
- What's happening? I tried knocking.
- He's not answering the intercom either.
Tony?
Tony?
Tony?
Maybe you should keep an eye
on the passengers.
Well, they wanna know
what's going on.
Perhaps give them some food
or something, keep them sweet.
Not much left.
Better than nothing.
No sign?
Hello? Hello?
We seem to have broken down
just outside Eastborough.
I think... I think it must be Thornton Forest,
and we can't seem to locate our driver.
Just looking for some advice
on how to proceed, over.
Tell me about it.
We've got chaos out there tonight.
We've got trees down,
signal failures.
ETA for replacement...
Sorry, go again on the ETA?
- Four hours?
- The storm has brought down a lot of trees.
So, what, you want me to stay
on this skanky train? Fuck right off!
What does the driver say?
Does he think he can fix it?
The driver...
...he's working on it.
Right, so he might be able
to get us going again?
No... I don't know... maybe.
- Is the train broken down or not?
- What did he actually say?
Well, I haven't been able to speak to him.
I can't, can't get through to him.
- Right. Forget it, I'll ask him myself.
- No, you can't do that.
- Watch me do that.
- No, we don't, we don't know where he is.
Sorry?
Are you telling us
the driver is missing?
Oh, my God.
- He didn't come back.
- Where's he gone?
I don't know. I'm trying to work on it.
I didn't want to worry you, so I didn't say anything.
Well, that didn't really work, did it?
I don't suppose you know
how to drive it?
The train, I mean.
I'm afraid not.
You need to get your supervisor
on the radio.
My husband has high blood pressure.
He can't wait here all night.
- I want my money back.
- Just calm down.
Get your supervisor on the radio...
Alright!
Thank you.
Now, the way I see it,
we've got two options.
Either we all sit here
and compose our complaint letters,...
...or we actually do something about it.
Like what?
Like use those wiggly things on the end of your legs
and walk on out of here.
The station can't be more than, what,
a two-miles walk, three max.
We might even get
a phone signal before then.
- I'm in.
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no! You can't, you can't just...
- Why not?
Because safety protocol clearly states passengers
must stay on the train and await assistance.

- Those are the rules, madam.
- Ridiculous.
I can't let you.. It's not ridiculous.
Those are the rules. I will lose my job.
Sir, you can't get out of there
without any keys.
- And do you have some keys?
- Yes!
- Would you kindly use them?
- No.
- Oh, come on!
- No, sir!
I will lose my job, sir.
I can't open the door.
I don't see there'll be a problem.
- Yeah, come on.
- It's stopped raining now.
- Please.
- Come on.
Well?
I can't leave the train
with these pensioners.
You just make sure
you keep up, son.
Come on!
Wouldn't you rather spend the night
in your own bed?
Get your keys out.
Please...
I'm gonna lose my job
for doing this.
Come on.
Come on, then.
- Okay? - Yes, fine.
- Well done.
Just keep straight down there.
Just keep straight down there.
Keep this side of the...
Wait up there, please.
- Want a hand?
- I'll hold your arm.
No, I'm first.
Okay, I'll go first.
- Bit of a drop, isn't it? - You'll be alright.
- Be careful.
- Okay.
- Careful.
There's a rail here,
you've just got to get your foot on.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Last but not least.
- Thanks.
- It's my pleasure.
Alright, we all stick together, please.
Mind your step out here.
I'll light the path.
I'll light the track.
That's the long metal thing
that the train goes on, is it, boss?
Stick together, please.
- I'm Nina.
- Billy.
- Hey!
- Fuel leak.
Why don't you walk with me?
Stay together, please.
Recognize where we are?
Could be Thornton Forest.
Don't worry,
it's just a deer or something.
- Come on, guys, it's getting closer now.
- Do you think it could be the driver?
- Why would he be in the bushes?
- I don't know.
- Just wait here.
- Can we not just keep on going?
What do you mean "wait here"?
You can't just leave us.
Where are you going?
Joe, what is it?
Go!

Back on the train, everyone!
Get back on the train, everyone!
Hurry!
Come on!
Where is the key?
- Joe!
- Hurry up!

Alright, go.
Go, go, go, go!
Joe, get in!
Wait!
Joe, come on!
Wait!
Wait!
Come on!
Help me!
Get in, get in! In! In! In! In!
Shut the fucking door!
Calm down!
Calm down!
Everyone, step back!
We'll lie her down
on the chair.
- Here, take this.
- Try and calm her down.
Tighten it around the wound.
Step back!
What do you see?
I can't see anything.
Get the first aid kit
and water.
Breathe! Breathe!
Everybody just stay calm!
I don't know what I'm doing.
Pressure on, get the pressure on!
The door, is it secure?
Check the door.
What the fuck was that?
Keep her quiet,
for fuck's sake!
Get her to shut the fuck up!
Fuck!
Fuck!
It's gone. It's gone.
We've got to get her
to a hospital.

Joe, we've got to call someone.
Joe!
Joe!
Joe, Joe, we need to call someone.
We need to call... call someone.
Just get someone, Joe.
Now! Now! Go, now!
This is the Eastborough sprinter service
requesting immediate emergency assistance.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
- You alright, mate?
- Yeah. Yeah, fine.
This was working earlier.
- How about getting the engine started?
- I haven't got the first clue about trains. Do you?
I know engines.
Dirt bikes, lawnmowers.
It's my old man's business, repairs.
There's your problem.
Fuel leak.
Yeah, the line must have split
when we crashed.
There might be some left in the tank but
without pressure we ain't gonna be able to restart her.
We're going nowhere
till it's patched.
I better tell the others.
We're just gonna have to sit tight
and wait for help.
My wife needs
medical attention now!
And meanwhile we're just
a train full of bear bait.

It wasn't a bear.
Bears don't howl.
What was it then, a wolf?
A dog couldn't do that.
There haven't been any bears or wolves
around here for centuries, alright.
What animal did that to her?
It wasn't an animal.
It was more like a man.
- Just lie back, love. You need to rest.
- No, you're not listening. You don't understand.
It wasn't an animal.
She's in shock.
What happened to the driver?
What?
What aren't you telling us?
- That's inside the train.
- Inside?
What are you doing?
No, that's not a good idea.
Oh, fuck.
You've got a knife, right?
Why would I have a knife?
Get a key.
Hurry up.
- No, no!
- Fuckin' hell!
Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Stinks of piss down here.
Who are you?
He's one of the passengers from earlier.
Help him up.
I don't... I don't believe this.
So... so.. what are you saying...
...is that we've definitely
gone past Barrock's Hill?
Have you not heard anything
we just told you?
No signal.
What a surprise.
I can't believe
I missed my stop.
It's great to have you on board.
Try to hold still, love.
- She's got a fever.
- Shock?
I've dealt with a dog bite before,
but I don't know what I'm doing.

Ellen, just sit down.
Stay calm for a minute.
Sit down.
There you are.
You okay?
What's wrong with her?
They're looking after her,
don't worry.
She'll be fine.
There was so much blood.
My daughter's got shoes
like those, they're cool.
Thanks.
She cannot wait
to be a teenager.
She hardly ever talks to me anymore,
she says that I embarrass her.
You seem pretty nice.
- My mum's my best friend.
- Really?
There's hope for me yet, then.
Won't she wonder
where you are?
No, she's usually in bed
by the time I get home.
And weekends, she's with her dad,
so I never...
It's back.
What the fuck is that?
- Maybe someone's come to...
- Sshhh.
- What the fuck is it?
- Stay back, stay back.
- Where is it going?
- Just be quiet. Shh.
- Whose phone is that?
- It's not mine.
- What the fuck?
- It must be someone's.
- Someone's got reception, someone's got reception.
- It's not me.
- Oh, my God. It's me.
- Well, answer it, then.
Answer it!
Hello?
Who is it?
- Mum, you got to listen to me, something's happened.
- Tell her where we are.
- No, please. Mum, no, please.
- Tell her where we are.
- Listen to me.
- Give me that phone.
Out of my way.
Give me that thing.
Get off me!
Help me!
Come on!
Shut up!
I think it's gone.
What is it?
Does anyone know?
It ain't a fucking dog, I can tell you that.
Now, shut up!
- We can't just leave her!
- She's gone!
We've got to go back.
She might still be alive.
We can't just leave her.
Why did you stop me?
I could have got her.
I was trying to save you.
- It was too late for her.
- It's your fault.
- You still wanna sit and wait?
- I didn't know this would happen!
- You've got to do something!
- It's too easy for it to get in.
- What are we gonna do?
- Stop listening to this prick.
- He's doing his best!
- I shouldn't even be on this train.
Enough!
Do you all wanna die tonight?
Cause' if you do, you just
carry on whinging and arguing...
...and soon enough, that thing out there,
he'll take care of it for you.
But if you still intend to get home,
then start acting like it.

It's an animal.
Animals hunt what's
easy to catch.
And look at us.
We're sitting ducks here.
So, let's try and make it a little bit harder
for the bastard, shall we?

Have you got any tools
on this train?
- What's wrong with you?
- Dodgy kebab gave me the shits.
- It's not easy, is it?
- Here. Here, I'll help you.
Thank you.
Listen.
I'm sorry about being such a cow
to you before.
It's just... I've spent too much
of my life on this train.
Tell me about it.
Jenny, here's some water, love.
Oh, sorry, it's nearly empty.
Was there any water anywhere?
Joe's got the last bottle.
I was told you might have
a bottle of water.
Yes, of course.
- What was her name?
- Who?
The girl.
The girl who was...
I don't know.
- Do you have any children?
- Yes.
I've got a daughter
who's about to be 13.
You?
Wasn't to be.
We wanted to, but...
Like we always say, we have each other
and that's the most important thing.
Thank you.
And thank you for
getting us in here.
No problem.
You're doing alright, you know.
- It's coming back, you know.
- Sorry?
Our friend out there
is coming back.
Might not.
Might have had enough.
Yeah.
Let me show you something.
Country house.
Wife, kids, dog, the works.
But then, there's this.
A city flat.
Five minutes's walk from the office,
nice view of Tower Bridge.
Perfect for entertaining
young ladies.
Discreet.
Two worlds never meet,
and everyone is happy.
- Good for you.
- The point is, we do what we have to to get by.

Sometimes, it ain't nice.
Take this lot.
Old, weak, afraid.
They're natural born victims.
And when that thing comes back,
when it gets in here...
...you can stand with them
and wait your turn to die...
...or you can use your keys
and open one of these doors.
And maybe...
Maybe you and I...
...can get out of this alive.
Survival of the fittest, my friend.
You think about it.
Oh my God!
Jesus!
Jenny.
Jenny, can you hear me?
Jenny!
What the fuck's happening to her?
- She needs help. She's sick.
- But why are her teeth falling out?
- Shut it!
- Look, old man, I'm just saying...
- I know what you're saying.
- Stop it!
Joe?
Joe?
Someone's missing.
The football guy.
He said he needed a shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?
He's gone.
You don't know that.
Just give him a minute.
Wait here.
Hurry up.
Hey, hey, where's he going?
What's happening?
Don't wanna lose anyone else.
It's fine.
Just one minute.
I'm not leaving this open.
- Paul?
- What?
Paul, come on, hurry up.
Open the door.
You've got to get back in the other carriage.
It's not safe down here.
- Fuck's sake, Paul?
- What?
- Paul, hurry up, we got to go back.
- I can't even shit in peace.
- No, it's not safe.
- For fuck's sake.
The... the door...
- What?
- I can't open the door, it's jammed.
The door is jammed!
- What are you doing?
- He's been in there long enough.
Shit! Help me!
Help me!
Get me out!

Shit! Get me out of here!
- Get me out!
- It's fucking broke.
Come on!
Fucking open the door!
What are you doing?
Getting out of here.
- We're trapped on this fucking train.
- What about Joe?
- He made his choice.
- At least he had the guts to try.
You should have gone with him!
You should be helping him!
- Just get out of the fucking train!
- We need to get them out, too!
- Fuck!
- Hurry up!
The key.
Open the fucking door!
Fucking hell!
Let's barricade it, quick!
It's not gonna hold on.
We need your help.
Pass me that.
Do something! Help him!
Fucking die!
Die!
It's dead. It's okay.
Let go!
It's dead.
It's okay.
Shh... It's gone, okay.

What did we just kill?
It's a man.
But its legs...
...and its teeth...
...are more like a dog's.
More like a wolf's.
- What?
- Just saying.
What are you saying?
Isn't it obvious?
We're looking at a werewolf.
What, like a full moon and silver bullet
sort of thing?
No.
But look at the legs,
triple-jointed.
The eyes, teeth.
Whatever it is, it's some kind of hybrid
between man and wolf.

It's wearing a ring, look.
It used to be like us.
Perhaps it's a disease.
Like a mutation.
Something you catch from animals.
Or a bite.
You're all too young to remember
the Thornton Forest rail crash.
1963.
Late night express came off the tracks,
somewhere near here.

When the emergency services got to them,
there was no one left to save.

All sorts of tales
about what they found.

Bodies half eaten by animals,
some just gone.

They never did find out
what really happened.
I never gave it much thought
after that.
Until tonight.
- So, this has happened before.
- We've killed it now, so we're sweet.
Jenny!
Jen?
Jenny?
She's one of them.
She's fucking one of them.
Leave her alone!
- She's sick.
- No, she's not.
She is infected.
We all know it.
And if we are gonna survive,
she has to go.
You touch one hair on my Jenny's head,
and I'll break your bloody neck.

- I don't think so, old man.
- Stay away from her, okay?
Alright.
No, no, no!
No, no, no, no, no.
Leave her alone!
Why don't you take a seat, sir.
Ged, Ged, where am I?
It's all right, Jenny.
Where am I?
Thank you.
Give me your fucking belt.
- What?
- Give me your belt.
- Tie him down.
- With pleasure.
Her, too.
We can't stay here.
We're not going to.
You've done this before.
Dirty bitch.
If we can find the leak, patch it up,
there might be enough left to get us moving.
All we need is enough
to get clear of the woods.
- Who's going?
- Me.
I'm the only one
who knows how.
I could do with a lookout, though.
I'll do it.
That's sorted then.
So, the ASBO kid's
fixing the train, is he?
I know about engines, you prick.
Yeah, right.
I got accepted onto an engineering course, actually.
That's why I was in town today.
Impressive.
Watch him.
Of course.
Let's go.
Engine lights, these go green,
it means I've patched the leak.
Fuel gauge.
That needle bounces up,
you need to turn on the ignition here.
- Then the main light should come on.
- That's it?
Not quite. Next, you need to prime the pump.
Pull down hard here.
Engage forward on the column,
then you need to push forward on the accelerator.
Nice and slowly.
Drive us out of this shithole, yeah?
Oh, and if you could remember to pick me up
on the way out, I'll buy you a beer.
Is it true?
About your interview?
Yeah, pretty much.
I saw you chuck
your jacket and tie in the bin.
Huh. Stupid cow said I needed
A-levels, didn't she?
Guess we'll see
if she was right.
I think you should say something.
This is your guard speaking.
I'd like to apologize once again for the delay
to your journey this evening.
A few hours ago,
we were strangers.
Most of you probably wish
we still were.
But we're gonna try
and get out of here now.
We're gonna do
whatever it takes to survive.
Together.
All of us.
I know you all
just want to get home.
So do I.
Next stop, Eastborough.
You ready?
Yeah.
Shine it down there.
This is it.
Keep an eye out, yeah?
Okay.
You don't remember me
at all, do you?
Should I?
I've been trying to place you all night.
Must be three years ago now?
I came for an interview
at Naughton and Price Brokers.
I thought it was going quite well, actually.
But you couldn't stop
looking down my top.
You had a tan line where your wedding ring
should have been.
And?
Well, you obviously
didn't make the grade.
Oh, well, I was more than qualified.
But you were more interested
in taking me back home for a follow-up.

Yes.
But, you're right.
I don't remember you.
- But I know your type.
- Oh, yes?
You arrive one day in my office,
full of sparkle...

...happy to fight it out with the boys
for a seat at the big table.
And then after a couple of years,
you swan off for nine months.
And when you return,
you're tired all the time.
Wracked by guilt.
All that baby weight making it oh-so-hard
to fight your way back up the ladder.
No more sparkle.
Jesus!
I feel sorry for your wife.
Don't you worry about her.
Hope you haven't got any kids
to fuck up, too.
Come on, Jenny. Hold on.
Gonna get you out of here soon.
Use your eyes, granddad.
There is no helping her.
She just needs the hospital.
I'm sure they'll be able to do something.
If we don't do something about her now,
it'll be too late.

Joe?
Why did you want that
stupid promotion anyway?
I don't know.
I guess I thought
I could change something.
Make people notice me.
It's what you do that matters,
not what it says on your name badge.
You've helped those people.
You've helped all of us.
I'm seriously thinking about
a change of career after tonight.
Come on.
Fuck, where are you?
Come on.
Matt! Matt!
Chuck me the tape.
I found the leak.
Under-qualified, my arse.
Here, chuck me that wrench.
Okay.
Ah, fuck.
Listen.
About before...
all that business with the ax,
I don't know what came over me.

Okay, mate.
Help!
Help me!
Get that light on me, buddy.
Matt, keep that light on me.
Matt! Matt!
What the fuck are you doing?
Hello?
Help me!
Hello?
Help!
Where are you?
Help!
Look, I...
About before, I...
I'm sorry, I...
It just all happened so quickly.
Where are you?
Help!
Help!
Oh, fuck.
Help!
Matthew!
Fuck!
She's fucking changing.
Come on, let me out of here.
She's turning, come on.
There's one wolf out there
and there's one fucking wolf in here.
We're all gonna die!
- Just shut up and let me think about it.
- Hey, help!
Fuck! Untie me, you stupid bitch!
Come on, come on, come on.
This should be it.
Ellen, quick!
He got the lights on.
Oh! Okay. Fuel...
- That one.
- Right, what's next?
- Pump.
- Prime the pump.
Gears.
- Okay.
- Just wait. Gotta wait for it.
Where are they?
- Okay, let's go. Let's go.
- No, we can't. Ellen, no!
Shit!
Shit!
Oh, God.
We're moving, Jenny.
Can you...
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Oh fucking hell!
Fucking hell! Let me out of here!
Get me out of here!
Do it, do it, do it!
Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.
Help me.
It works.
No, no, it's working.
Look, it's working.
It's working.
Go, come on, it's going, it's going.
Help me.
Help me!
No! No! God, no.
Please don't... Please don't...
Please don't...
Please, please don't kill me.
Jenny!
Jenny!
No!
Oh, shit.
Jenny.
Stay away from me.
Stay away.
No. No!
Fuck!
No!
Why has it stopped?
What's happened?
Ellen, come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!
Stay away from me!
Stay away!

Better late than never.
Good to see you've finally
grown a pair.
Joe, Joe!
Where's Kate?
Where's Kate?
She'd still be alive
if you hadn't tied me up.
- Where exactly are we going to, boss?
- To the woods.
We'll never stand a chance.
Unless one of us stays behind.
Stop it!
Back off!
Get over there! Get back!
Fucking bitch.
You really think you're in control,
don't you, Joe?
You've finally become a man.
And you've stood up
to the challenge well.
You think you've got it
all worked out, don't you?
Oh, no.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on, you fucking mutts!
Get that door open.
Come on! Let's have it!
Go, go, go!
Joe!
Follow the track.
To the track.
Come on.
Come on, Joe!
Let's go!
- Too late.
- What?
- It's too late.
- No, let's go!
- They're on to us.
- No, let's go, Joe.
There's a track.
There's a track there.
Joe!
Come on.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.
No, no. No!
- Joe! Joe, no, come on!
- You have to go.
Come with me, Joe!
Run! Ellen, run!
Go!
Go!
Come on!
First thing I'm gonna do is buy this place
and burn it the fuck down.
Hello?
Who's there?
Joe?
Where are you, mate?
Joe?
Oh, fuck!
