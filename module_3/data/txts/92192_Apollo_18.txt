This is very big and heavy.
Apparently not manned.
Apparently.
Transmissions must occur via high frequency

due to the Russian anti-missile system.
These are advanced

These should all follow and we pick

That keeps the Russians in the eye.
It would be nice to my wife telling

We see no evidence.
We will discuss with Defense.
We'll look into it.
Go to sleep.

Yes, the temperature drops.
Look at the footprints.
It makes no sense .
It runs in circles.
disoriented.
Why?
- I do not know.
They come from this side off.
Come here.
It is the Russians.

How can Russians are on the moon, but no one knows
We are on the Mon
While no one knows.
Something's not right.
I'll look inside.
The lights are out.
Someone is gone mad.
Everything is destroyed.
Their system is not very different from ours
.
The electricity is on.
Oxygen Reserve is good.
I can not tell whether they < br /> is fully operational.
Where are they going to explained?
- I do not know.
I want to look around.
- Stay or in the neighborhood.
The Russians could be anywhere.
What is that?
There's a lot of blood here.
Someone quite wounded.
I do not like this.
I think I see something in the crater.
I'm going down.
Wait, Ben.
The suits are not immune to such cold.
The crater is so deep.
Het is zo koud.
I'll look around.
The ground is different.
It is soft.
Get out.
is so cold.
Get out, Ben.
Well, I'm going upstairs.
One dead cosmonaut.
I way up.
Is it?
- Yeah, I'm going upstairs.
What happened here?
Maybe the other cosmonaut?
- Do you think killed him?
There's a tear.
- What do you do?
Get your head out.
What was that?
That was a stone.
That he had with him when she
have dragged out.
I do not know.
- We're outta here.
We can not return soon, Ben.
If we do not go, we are dead.
I do not like that here
someone has died.
This is a secure line?
I do not talk only with you, Tommy?
That's right.
The Russians have been on the moon. </ p >
Say that again?
- The Russians have landed on the South Pool.
We have found their LK lander Proton.
It's not over the cosmonaut.
Have you found the spot where it crashed?
- He is not crashed.
We have found his body in a crater. <br / > - You have found a dead cosmonaut?
You knew nothing of this?
We landed two meters from a Russian LK.
And you did not know that were here?
They have 69 manned flight canceled.
This is the official message.
Did you know they were here?
Dit is een Defensiemissie. Ik geef alleen door
wat ik moet weten. Dat kan ik je alleen zeggen.

Get some rest. I get to go
Defense here and talk with you again soon. </ P> Tommie is sincere. </ P> I knew from the beginning that something is wrong

Wat doen we hier dan?
Wat doen we hier echt?
Het is wel wat griezelig.
Vreemde schoonheid aan de achterkant.
Ik weet niet of ik het me verbeeld...
maar als je soms uit die kleine raampjes kijkt,
dan lijkt het of er iets terugkijkt.
Naar jou.
Look at this.
What?
- Check it out.
The flag is gone.
This can not. <br / > - Houston, this is 18.
Houston, Liberty.

If there is another, he would
oxygen for at least 12 hours needed.
What do you think, John?
- I absolutely can not.
So much he can not carry oxygen.
How can he survive?
Maybe there is not a 'he'. <br / > - the Russians flew a man here?
That would not be the first time.
- It was a cosmonaut.
and killed the other cosmonaut?
Call agree with Defence.
Now.
We suspect the Soviets ,
but we have no confirmation.
The Secret Service warned that they hide a routine mission
satellite launches.
Why did not you tell us that?
National security.
you probably understand.
Maybe a little too.
We were concerned that they would be first.
That would
based on national security
have been a disaster.
Where is the other cosmonaut?
they left him behind?
Our Intelligence
say that there was only one cosmonaut.
It is time for you to get back home.
That's it then?
What was that?
- We're outta here.
It looks good.
Ten seconds.
Ten seconds.
Wait for my signal.
Eight...

Save this damn thing.
I'm trying.
I have an energy problem.

We have a leak somewhere.
- I try to isolate the tank.
Houston, you get
Houston, you will receive?
We lost communication.
Communications closed.
No, no.
- What's Going On?
Houston, this is Liberty.
We're just lost communication.
How did that happen?
- No idea.
Maybe The LEM touched
or a meteor shower.
It is impossible to say without
to watch.
I'll look.
- Are you certain of this?
We have communication
needed to get home.
Wait here.
Put your suit on.

but I see no meteor debris.
This is pulled to pieces.
- Is there something?
I can not say.

Go to a different frequency.
- Do not. It blocks. </ P> Something I've never heard of. </ P> Wait. </ P> Talk to me. What do you see? </ P> The spores appear. </ P> Footprints?
Maybe there is another cosmonaut. </ P> No.

They block our communication.
They send a signal.
Why would they do that?
No, keep filming.
We need this record.
In order to attract
things that made the tracks that you saw.
Or what the cosmonaut killed.
All these cameras, man...
They look at us.
We are all alone.
We are guinea pigs.
This is why the sun here.
All that is necessary to supply channels.
