[ Girl ]
Uh, good morning, Dad.
[ Man ]
Good morning, Jennifer.
When you were in school,
did you ever cut class?
Uh... yeah.
Most kids cut classes.
Good. Sign this.
Have your mother sign it.
I'm late.
But Mom doesn't understand.
She never cut classes.
[ Girl #2 ]
Mommy never cut classes.
Will you stop copying me?
[ Woman ]
Jack, what about breakfast?
I haven't got time.
You've got to make time.
[ Boy ]
I made it for you.
Breakfast is my class project.
What did you make?
Spaghetti and
one hard-boiled egg.
Hold the spaghetti.
Throw in another egg,
and I'll eat it in the car.
Jack!
Jack.
You stop, or I'll shoot!
Jack!
I'm late.
What's in the cup?
Herbal tea?
Liar.
Coffee picks me up.
It also gives you heartburn
and flattens your adrenals.
How's it feel,
always being right?
I revel in it.
Watch it, Mother Teresa.
I love you!
Sure. Bring it up now
when I'm going to work.
Ugh.
Oh, great.
Don't they teach
those kids anything?
You're supposed to
put them in cold water
after you boil them.
Aw.
Wonderful.
Ugh.
Not bad.
[ Man On Radio ]
If you did contribute,
the Lord will
guarantee you
a place in heaven.
Will there be weeping?
Or will the gates of...
Jesus said,
"Don't talk to me
when I'm talking to you."
Wouldn't you like
Reverend Archie's Edited Bible
in your own home?
Aw, jeez!
My fault.
It was my fault.
I should've told him
to boil the other egg.
[ Horn Blaring ]
You son of a bitch!
Try that again,
you moron!
Hey, excuse me.
Hello?
Sorry, pal. I'm late.
Am I supposed
to wait all day?
Great! Nice way
to start the day.
Oh, God.
I'm not
built for this.
I'll corner that guy
at lunchtime
and strangle him.
I'm late now.
Why do they
need these anyway?
I've worked here 10 years.
They know me by now.
Another stupid thing.
Great. I'm late again.
This is gonna look good.
You descend
and maintain 12,000.
Pan Am 3,
descend to 15,000.
Turn right
to 2-5-0 degrees.
This is Pan Am 3.
Say again.
I say again,
descend to 15,000
and turn right
to 2-5-0.
There's a Lufthansa jumbo
in that space.
Are you trying to mate us?
Uh, Pan Am 3, disregard.
Maintain at, uh, 17,000
and present heading 2-2-0.
United 3-2,
turn right heading 1-7-0.
American 4-1,
reduce 10 knots.
You, November 3-4-7 Gulf...
Where are you?
Where the hell are you?
Come in!
Where are you?
Acknowledge, please!
Acknowledge, please!
Where are you?
It's O.K., Jack.
I don't know where
this small plane is!
A fly landed
on your screen.
I hate flies!
I hate them.
Filthy things. They do that.
Come on.
Let's take your break.
Can't you pull
some strings?
The agency gave
you a mandatory five.
You've landed planes
for 13 years.
You're burned out.
It's not a dirty word.
You need this rest.
I can't believe this!
Just because
of a stinking fly.
Ow! Oh, gee!
Ow! Rats! Ohh!
Ow, that hurt!
Ahh!
What's he
kicking, Mom?
I don't know.
He's just
a little overworked.
You know your father.
Daddy, can I drive?
Sure! I figured
we'd divvy it up.
You take
the second 100 miles.
Are you going
to keep doing that?
Knock it off.
Thank you.
I've forgotten something.
What have I forgotten?
Only the wallpaper.
We'll get some on the road.
Don't mock me, Sandy.
It's the first time
I've gone on one of these things.
I'm nervous.
Sorry.
Is everyone
wearing seat belts?
O.K. Here we go.
All right!
All right!
Yeah!
Can't wait to swim
in the ocean!
Whoo-hoo!
Next stop,
Citrus Cove, Florida.
Daddy, I have to pee.
Now I know what I forgot.
How many rooms are there?
It's three bedrooms.
It's on the beach.
It was nice of Hal
to find the place.
And to say that
I'm cracking up.
You're not.
You just need a rest.
We just got back
from Hawaii.
Jack, that was
our honeymoon.
Yeah.
This might be fun.
Rise and shine,
everybody!
We're here!
[Honk]
Hey, look, water!
Could we go swimming?
Could we go swimming?
The water is beautiful!
I told you I'd find Florida.
Now you have
to find Citrus Cove.
Found it.
Beach Lane.
Good navigating, honey.
Thank you.
What are we
looking for?
411...
413...
413...
415!
This is it.
Ohh!
Hal is a friend.
It's two stories.
It's redwood.
Can I have the room
with the balcony?
This is great!
Oh, my goodness!
Watch me shoot
some baskets!
O.K., Daddy, here I go!
It really is very lovely.
I hope the key's
are in the mailbox.
Just like the old man said.
O.K., let's go!
Hurry!
All right, contestants,
let's see what's behind
door number one!
- Oh, Jack!
- Oh, it's beautiful!
Look at
these glass pieces!
Mom, this is huge!
They got a piano!
Oh, honey,
look at the view!
We're right
on the water!
Wow!
Whew!
It's a brochure.
It's a postcard.
Don't run up
those stairs.
Move, Bobby!
I'm trying.
They're heavy!
So is this.
Hi.
[Woof]
Archie!
It's O.K.
He's just barking.
Just barking.
Don't be afraid.
Come on, Arch!
He always barks
at people he likes.
Come on, Arch!
He must really like you.
Archie, get your ass
up here right now!
Where am I
putting these?
Don't throw off
my balance.
Finish emptying
the U-Haul tomorrow.
I'm putting my suffering
into one day.
I don't mind
unloading bags.
I just don't want to do
it for a living.
I'll go to
the grocery store.
You can take
the kids swimming.
Aw, gee! I forgot
my bathing suit.
I can't go swimming.
Nobody cares
what you look like
in a bathing suit.
That's just it.
I'll get you one.
I won't wear it
until I lose
a few pounds.
I love how you look
in a bathing suit.
My mother was right.
You're twisted.
Mm-hmm.
Grrr!
What are you
looking at?
Uh... nothing, Dad.
Yeah. Me neither.
Hey, Dad!
We want to go in!
You guys
go swimming.
Aren't you coming?
I don't want to get
too wet my first day.
O.K. Can you hold these?
Sure.
There you go.
[Music Plays]
This thing works
pretty good for 8 bucks.
[Music Gets Louder]
How do you shut it off?
Equalizer.
Loud, aren't they?
Jack Chester.
I'm your neighbor.
And you're...
Having lunch.
Mmm. Looks good.
Just enjoy.
I don't want to bother you.
I'll join you
later for martinis.
Kidding.
Just watching my kids.
I'll be here.
Enjoy.
Aah!
Don't worry. It's dead.
I told you
not to do that.
She told me to do it.
Enough!
Enough.
Just take it away.
Dad, you're red.
Good.
I wanted to get
a little color.
That's a good base.
That's a good base.
You got to do
this in stages.
I'll put this on.
It's bad?
Your nose would show
on a satellite photo.
I'm O.K. If I don't
make many turns.
Where are we going?
A place called
the Yachthouse.
It has fresh seafood.
Let's talk lobster.
Yeah! Lobster!
[Whistle]
Would that be
a 3-pounder?
3 1/4 pounds.
Perfect.
Yours is the next table.
Ahem.
Oh. Sorry.
Excuse me.
You're next.
I'm not next.
I'm down the line.
I'm checking
my dinner.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Pardon. Pardon.
Sorry. Oops!
Excuse me.
How does it look?
It'll be a while yet.
I got mints and toothpicks
to hold us over.
Hey.
The same guy is
in all the pictures.
Captain Al Pellet.
He's won
seven years straight.
I guess he's good.
Wow! They're big!
Excuse me, sir.
How much longer?
Yours should be
the very next table.
- Great.
- I'm starving.
So am I.
It's been hours
we've waited.
Excuse me, little lady.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Good evening,
Mr. Pellet.
How were
your winds today?
Just fine.
There will be five of us.
Would you, uh,
part the waves
and let my party
through, please?
It's O.K.
It's O.K.
I thought we were
the next table of five.
Your table should
be ready shortly.
What about
that group?
Mr. Pellet had
a reservation.
You don't take
reservations.
We don't,
except for Mr. Pellet.
We'll have a table ready
for you any moment.
I see several are drinking
their coffees now.
Look at the menu.
I know what
we're having... lobster.
Bravo.
Bravo.
It's O.K.
I took care of everything.
We're next.
Nobody tells me I can't sit.
I'll sit when I want.
We sit next.
No need for those.
Let's all have the lobster.
Show us what you got.
And, Stan,
no arguments.
This dinner
is on you.
He thought I'd say,
"On me."
Huh?
Hey.
Maybe they're just
taking them for a walk.
Look at
these beauties.
Hey!
Don't serve those.
What are you doing?
These are my lobsters.
You got my table.
You're not getting
my lobsters.
This is your table?
My table!
Oh, I see.
This is your table,
and these are
your lobsters.
Right.
I suppose this
is your wife, hmm?
Is this your tie?
Nope.
Is this your shirt?
Mm-mm.
Is this your belt?
Are these your shorts?
I've been driving all day.
We just get into town.
I'm waiting two hours.
You just got into town.
I've been in town
for 30 years.
30 years!
Every summer,
you renters think
you can take over the town.
Boil them.
Wait a minute.
Signore, we'll have
a table for you
in 20 minutes.
Forget it.
We're going to
a good restaurant.
You don't want to eat
where there's rats.
I found rats
in the back.
How disgusting.
Ohh!
A whole nest of rats.
Sorry. He was
obviously a slob.
This is it?
There's the Barnacle.
There's the boat
off the dock.
The guy at
the gas station
said the food's great.
Well, it's got character
and live entertainment.
I don't want
any complaints.
Let's sit
and enjoy ourselves.
This place sucks.
Where'd you
learn that?
I told her never
to say things suck.
Look.
An ugly pirate.
Oh. Really?
Where?
Hello,
me buccaneers.
Me name's Scully.
What might
your name be, me lass?
My name's Laurie.
Where's your hand?
Oh, I don't think
you want to know that.
What's it going to be?
Can you recommend
something?
Absolutely.
Scully's Catch of the Day.
It's fresh grouper.
It's lightly breaded,
sauteed to a golden brown
in lemon butter and shallots,
with a teasing hint of Dijon.
We'll take five.
Cortez!
Si, señor.
Cinco Scully's
Catch of the Day.
Cinco Scully's
Catches of the Day.
Bon appetit.
Thank you very much.
Isn't this place nice?
Always listen to
gas station attendants.
They know where to eat.
Huh?
What are you doing?
It's O.K., honey,
it's just Noxzema.
You were moaning in your sleep
about your sunburn.
Why did you
remind me?
Ow! It hurts!
Oh, poor baby.
I'm not a baby.
Mommy, make it go away.
It hurts.
Oh!
I hate the sun!
I know.
Ohh... but I love this house.
Ooh, I love you.
Ooh! Mm! Ooh!
We should rent
this house every summer.
I'll talk to
the guy tomorrow.
You smell so good.
It's the Noxzema.
Put some over here.
You're not burnt there.
I know.
[Rattling]
Sandy, did
you hear that?
Get up.
Archie, if that's you,
I'll kill you.
Archie, what did you do?
What's going on?
Archie, there's somebody
at the front door.
Go see who it is.
O.K., you cover me.
Freeze, asshole!
Please don't harm
the children.
I won't.
Jack...
Jack, what's going on?
Daddy...
who the hell are you?
We're the three bears!
And you?
I'm Dan Gardner,
the owner
of this house.
I rented this house
from Elwin Haskell.
You rented...
May I see
your receipt?
You want to see
my receipt?
Where the hell's
my receipt?
It's on the table.
Is this a time-share place?
Here. Month of July.
Jack Chester, that's moi.
415 Beach Road,
$2,000!
415 Beach Road?
That's right.
This house
is 415 Beach Lane.
Aha!
This must be yours.
Come on in.
You have wonderful
closet space.
- It makes life so much easier.
- Ahem.
Come on, Arch.
Come on, Arch.
Archie, come on!
O.K., kids, upstairs.
This should do it.
It's just Kibble.
You have
a vacuum cleaner?
That's enough.
Do you have
a dustpan?
You could leave that.
You might
have a visitor,
and they
have a dog.
This is excellent.
Excellent.
Archie, let's go.
Last time,
you got sick.
Come on, Archie.
Here we go.
Goodbye!
Have a nice summer.
I, uh...
forgot my Noxzema.
Have a little
patience, dear.
He does have
a bad burn.
And my daughter.
I wet my bed, Daddy.
No, sweetheart.
You wet their bed.
[Power Saw Buzzes]
Flies!
We got flies.
They followed me
from Atlanta.
Got you!
Banana?
A little.
I called
the plumber!
He'll be here
this afternoon.
The landlord pays
for repairs.
He's in
intensive care.
[Power Saw Stops]
[Sighs Of Relief]
[Power Saw Starts]
[Hammering]
Thank you.
Get out of here!
Pass the milk, please!
Here!
Thank you!
Here we go.
Great. Great.
What is this?
What is this?
Honey,
you're wearing pajamas.
I know, I know.
Excuse me.
Why are you
going through here?
[Loud Burp]
Oh, perfect.
Come on through.
I'm Joe Public.
Welcome to my beach.
I'll take Laurie.
I'll be at the beach.
Wait, let me get
my stuff.
This isn't
a nude beach.
Oh, Daddy.
Who do you think
you are... Lolita?
Hi.
Just move in?
Uh-huh.
I'm Russ.
Hi.Jennifer.
This is Annie.
That's a CPR doll.
Yeah, I teach CPR.
I'm known as
Mr. Mouth-to-mouth.
Hey, Jennifer, let's take
Laurie to nursery school.
Not today, Dad.
I thought you'd
left already.
Laurie, you forgot
your lunch, sweetheart.
Should she talk to him?
Why not?
Are you crazy?
He's a lifeguard.
They're all
sex maniacs.
His gonads are screaming,
"Me first."
Don't worry.
I'll be around her.
I'll see you later.
O.K., ladies, let's go!
Hey, pops.
Take a bow.
Jack-off!
That guy looks
like John Madden.
Great.
Lifeguards next door.
A gaggle of them.
I guess I won't drown.
[Whistling]
They whistled at us.
Don't look!
The one on the left
was so cute!
Ow! Hot, hot!
Oh, uh, boy!
We should've
brought shoes.
I can't walk.
My feet are burning.
O.K., just hop up on Daddy.
Hot!
There you go.
There's my girl.
Hold on.
Whew, boy!
Here we go.
We have
to find Mommy now.
Excuse me.
Ow!
Jeez, I'm sorry.
That was my hand!
Sorry about that.
Oh! Oh!
Oh! Oh!
It's this darn cooler.
The thing broke off.
I'm waiting for
a part from Minneapolis.
Lift up your foot!
You're getting
sand in my lens!
Send the bill to
415 Beach Lane.
Damn right I will!
You big bozo.
That's our lunch!
Watch it,
that's my hat.
Hey, honky!
Aah!
Oh, sorry.
It's just ice water.
Hey,
what are you...
You should've
covered it.
Watch it!
You shouldn't
cook here.
Where's your mother?
Sandy!
Jack!
Didn't you hear
me calling?
I've been all over.
O.K., sweetheart,
get down.
Am I glad
to be here.
I'm glad
you're here.
Can you finish
blowing up Bobby's raft?
Yeah.
I'm breathing out,
anyway.
What the heck.
Thank you.
How was
nursery school?
It was great.
She graduated.
What?
Mother Goose retired.
What a shame.
You want to build
a sand castle?
Yeah.
Hey, Sandy.
Yeah?
What's Jennifer
doing there?
Talking with
her new friend.
Do we want that?
They're just talking.
That's how she
got here, remember?
Hey, Dad!
Here's your raft.
I want
to play Frisbee.
Here, catch.
* O, say,
can you see? *
Bobby, throw long.
Go!
Hey, nice one.
Albert,
you octopus, you.
Hey, what are you doing?
Your wife's
on my Wham-O.
Get out of here.
Sure, why not?
Return it to
415 Beach Lane...
Beach Road.
Get back to it.
14-13.
Control's
the name of the game.
Pass it to me.
With your hands and my height,
we'll destroy them.
Are you ready, mister?
Yeah, we're ready.
Let's get them!
Let's eat them up!
Go, team!
Best two out of three?
You're being too hard
on yourself.
You haven't played
volleyball for years.
Yeah?
Tell that to Bobby.
Right now he's wishing
you were a widow.
Have a grape.
I think your
blood sugar's low.
That's it!
How could I
be so stupid?
Of course.
I'm a sailor.
I'm a great sailor...
and I'm going to take
my son sailing!
Do you rent
sailboats?
We sure do.
All right!
We'd like a look
at them.
They're all rented up
for two weeks.
Everyone's practicing
for the regatta.
I want to teach
my son how to sail.
Any other place
we could rent one?
Well, there's one.
Which boat
will it be?
Tough choice,
isn't it?
Hey, Dad,
how about one like this
without the crud on it.
That crud is
crustaceous morticus,
pejoratively
referred to as barnacles.
She was
a fast lady in her day.
I'm sure.
We'll take
the 12-footer.
That's a fine choice.
You're your
own ballast in her.
That's good.
Yeah, O.K.
Ready to cast off?
You bet, Dad.
You get a free lesson.
I'll take them.
I already know how.
Thank you.
Ready, son?
Here we go!
I got it going!
Here we go.
Bye!
You just pull the sail
towards you
and you're sailing.
There's a boat there!
I see him. It's O.K.
Sharp turn here.
Yeah.
We made it.
Scared?
Not me.
I was.
I was a little
scared there.
Where did you
learn how to sail?
Camp Weehonk.
They had a big lake.
There's the lncisor.
Yeah.
Isn't she a beauty?
Let's get closer.
O.K., Captain,
here we go!
All right!
That's
a gorgeous boat.
Too bad a big fart
like that owns it.
Yeah,
the big fart.
Watch your
Language, will you?
Bear off to starboard.
That skiff's close.
We got the right of way.
Let him move.
We're heading
straight toward him!
Smaller craft have
the right of way.
I don't think
he knows that!
What are you doing?
My knee! My knee!
Your bad one, Dad?
Yes, yes, yes.
You put a hole
in my boat!
It's you again.
You hit my boat.
You hit my boat!
Why didn't
you give way?
You're telling me
how to sail?
I had the right of way!
You city rat!
I got a kid.
You're supposed
to move, dipshit!
Yeah,
you big fart!
I'm going
to get you for this!
You're finished!
No, he's not!
Tell him, Dad!
Shit for brains!
Look at this hole.
Give me a hand
with the hole!
You're not hungry.
I'm not anything.
You're only laid up
a couple of days.
There are things
we can do.
Like what?
Well...
Free tonight, sailor?
I don't
want your pity.
Take what
you can get.
I'll take it.
Now, Marty Ewing,
young rookie
trying to make
a name for himself,
putting for the birdie.
This green's troubled
many pros today.
There's the touch,
there's the roll,
and oh, my...
look at that.
He's got that birdie.
Take another look
in slow motion.
Ah! Ah!
Ever so gently.
Hurry up!
We are always late.
Let's get inside.
Go ahead, Mom.
Come on,
we got to hurry.
O.K., O.K., O.K.
Sit here
for a second, sweetie.
Oh, no.
I can't believe it.
I forgot my wallet.
We're going to miss it!
Oh, shit.
I mean, shoot.
Oh, shoot!
Take their tickets
out of this.
I can't
let you do that.
Please,
it'll be my pleasure.
Mom, let him.
If you'll
let us repay you.
Fair enough.
Four adults and two kids.
I'm Don Moore.
My son Gregg.
Nice meeting you.
I'm Sandy Chester.
This is Laurie, Jennifer, and Bobby.
Hi. Let's go.
Popcorn! Popcorn!
I'll get some.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you
listening to?
WHAM 104.
["Footloose" Plays]
Hey.
Thanks, Dad.
Want some?
Thanks.
Don Gufferson's
first shot on 17.
[Woof Woof]
Could be the longest one
of the foursome.
All right, all right.
Come on in, Arch.
Couldn't you
do that outside?
What do you want?
[Woof Woof]
Your bone.
You go get it.
[Woof Woof Woof]
Well, go get it!
All right, I'll get it.
I thought the dog
was supposed to fetch.
Archie!
Archie!
Open the door!
Open this damn door!
Get out of my chair!
Get out of my popcorn,
you dirty, rotten...
For you, the TV clears up!
Aah, he missed that.
Jeez!
Archie!
If I get in,
you're a rug!
Ah, breakfast
with the family.
Get dressed.
We're going on a speedboat.
Don just called.
Don?
The guy
who lent us money.
He invited us on
his cabin cruiser.
You feel like it?
Ow, ow, ow!
I don't think so.
Not today.
We'll do
something else.
No, no.
You should go.
You're sure?
Of course I'm sure.
I'll be busy
changing the air in my splint.
O.K.
Yay! We're going
with Don and Gregg!
Is his wife nice?
She's in Ohio
with George.
Don got divorced
last year.
Have a lovely day,
darling.
I love you!
I love you, too.
So, how is everybody?
Good.
You look good.
Want an orange?
Juice or something?
At 105 degrees
climbing to 110,
this is a record high.
Bobby, you're doing great!
He's good at this.
All right, Bobby!
Way to go, Bob!
Hi.
Oh, what a shame.
I'm so sorry.
You didn't
do anything.
I've been waiting
to meet you.
Really?
I'm your neighbor,
Vicki Sanders.
Jack Chester.
Listen, I just made
some fresh lemonade.
Why don't
you come over?
Oh, no.
Oh, come on!
I wouldn't
want to impose.
lmpose.
What are neighbors for?
Come on.
Really.
What happened
to your leg?
Boating accident.
Does it hurt?
It would if I let it.
Ow!
I wanted
to become a pilot,
but with the family
and responsibilities,
I became
a controller instead.
You and I have
so much in common.
I wanted
to be a stewardess,
but Ed didn't
want me away.
I do electrolysis.
Hello!
Hello. Anybody home?
Looks like
nobody's here.
I have to go bad.
O.K., but hurry up.
Don't sit
on the seat.
Excuse me.
I'm dying of thirst.
Could I get some water?
Help yourself.
Thanks a million.
Hello.
You have good vision?
You have to
in your business.
Well, it helps.
You're
very observant.
Can I have
your honest opinion?
Sure.
What do you
think of these?
What do you think?
About what?
These.
Oh, those.
How do they look?
Ah...
similar.
I mean,
do they look good?
I just got them.
Who had them
before you?
Nobody, silly.
I just
had them enlarged.
Oh, I see.
They cost
2,000 bucks.
[Whistles]
It was these
or a chain saw for Ed.
Good choice.
I'd take those
over a power tool.
Do they look real?
Well, you fooled me.
They're not too big?
No.
No, no, no.
[ Man Yawning ]
Would that be Ed?
Yeah. He's
just waking up.
Ah, you'll excuse me.
I'm a dead man.
[Pop]
Aw, great. Husband's coming,
and I blow a leg.
Again? Put your top on!
I'm sorry. I didn't
see anything.
He's our neighbor.
I'm just renting.
She's boring everyone
with her knockers.
I just want
his opinion.
Last night she shoved them
in a clerk's face at the 7-11.
They look right
and feel right.
- Yeah...
- Will you tell her they feel right?
As a favor to me.
Oh, yeah.
Those are so lifelike,
it's ridiculous.
Honey, everybody
likes them.
Thanks. I owe you one.
What are
neighbors for?
I gave up
a power tool for those.
Christmas
is coming soon.
$2,000 for the set?
For both of them.
They're fun for
the whole family.
We'll give you
the doctor's number.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Hey, what gives here?
Cut that out.
Get out of here.
That's our bike!
Get off my bike!
O.K. Who's getting
the cheese omelette?
Oh, right here.
How do
you like it?
Fluffy.
Who gets sausages?
Watch
it, fats.
You break the zipper...
Will you be long?
I'm next.
I have to have
those pants tonight.
I only have
two pairs in Florida.
Get out!
Party's over!
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house!
Get out, get out, get out!
Get off the phone!
I'll call you back.
A nut's here.
Get out!
Jesus!
[ Grunts ]
You, out.
Bug off, buddy.
I was here first.
Get the hell
out of here now.
You get out, fella.
I'm watching The Smurfs.
Yeah?
You're watching The Smurfs?
Did you see
when Papa Smurf took a crutch
and smashed a guy
with a red hat?
Did you see that one?
Archie, you stink.
- Traitor.
- [ Whimpers ]
Morning, Colonel.
Hey, mate.
What can I get you?
How about, uh, drunk?
We can handle that.
Thank you.
You have an ice cube
for this?
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.
I'm telling you
that as a fighter,
pound for pound,
my boy Jimmy Cagney
will disintegrate
your Sylvester Stallone.
He'll knock
his block off.
In a street fight, maybe.
Yes. I give you that.
But not in a movie...
Especially not with today's
"cinemanatic" advancements.
It's technologically
impossible.
Do you have any more of those
little oyster crackers left?
You ate them all!
They were so good.
Maybe another beer.
They're pretty filling, aren't they?
Mas cerveza!
Yeah. It's probably
better for me.
That's a fine shot.
O.K. Count them up.
Who threw this one?
Blue. That's you.
I win.
Hey, big winner
there, Scull-man.
I love you, Scully.
It's not
the booze talking.
I'm sorry
I wrecked your boat.
You got to let me
pay for it.
Naw, she's fine.
It gives her more character.
Anyway, I should've
given you that lesson.
You're at fault?
You're not at fault!
I'm the one who
said I could sail.
I used to sail
when I was a kid,
but I can't sail.
You know
what it's like
to peak when
you're 18 years old?
Yes, I do.
Would you like
to learn to sail,
really to sail?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I call this craft Shatzie.
It's nicknamed
for my sweetheart.
We name vessels
after women
to remind us to
treat them gently, like ladies.
Otherwise they won't
respond like ladies.
So remember,
always gentle
on the tiller.
You understand that?
Yeah...
[Vomiting]
Oyster crackers.
Good!
That should be
the last of it.
Can we go home now?
You said you wanted
to be a sailor.
So we'll stay here
till you become one.
Ah, this is the life.
Aye. Nothing like the sea
to lift your spirits,
put a song
in your heart.
I know
what you mean.
You must know
many ocean songs.
I do.
Here's a sea ditty
me mother taught me.
* Love *
* Exciting and new *
* Come aboard *
* We're expecting you *
* And love *
* Life's sweetest reward *
* Let it flow *
- * It flows back to you *
- * It flows back to you *
* The Love Boat *
* The Love Boat *
* Soon will be making *
* Soon will be making *
* Another run *
* Another run *
* The Love Boat *
* The Love Boat *
Jack.
Jack.
Oh, that's cute.
Are you going
to sleep all day?
I guess you are.
We'll be home early!
I'm up.
I'm up. I'm up.
I'm up.
Ohh, it's still dark.
Ohh!
I'm going to feel that
in the morning.
Hi.
Buenas dias.
Where's Scully?
[Speaking Spanish]
Thanks. Scully!
Over here!
He's over there.
That's what I says.
You know
what to do?
Before I jibe,
I say, "Jibe ho."
That's right.
Prepare to jibe, jibe ho.
Jibe ho! Whoa!
What happened?
I yelled, "Jibe ho."
You say, "Jibe ho,"
and then you jibe.
I don't know what to say.
I'm sorry.
Come pick me up.
Gee, I'm, uh...
Yeah, right.
Let me tack.
Why don't you
swim to me?
Can you tread water
with that hook?
Does your head hurt?
Yes, it does.
It was my fault,
wasn't it?
Oh, yes.
I guess I'm not much
of a sailor, am I?
No, you're not...
But you're
going to be.
When I get
through with you,
you'll be good a sailor
as I ever was.
Maybe better.
You want
some more ice?
Aye.
I got the lotion
and your towels.
- Please let's hurry, O.K.?
- Bye, Dad.
Bye, Dad.
What, no kiss?
Look, if your leg
starts hurting,
I'll carry you.
Bye, Dad.
Bye.
I don't
want to push it.
I'll just
sit around and kill flies.
Honey, do you
want to have a talk?
No.
[Horn Honking]
You're not having fun.
Are you having fun?
I'm having
lots of fun.
If you're having fun,
I'm having fun.
Soon, we'll be having
fun together.
[Honking Continues]
I'm going to
go have today's fun.
Great!
Got him!
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Perfect day
for sailing.
We're not going sailing.
We're going dancing.
Pardon?
Know what
your trouble is?
I have to
lose a few pounds.
You're
an air controller.
If you think you can
control the sea like a 747,
I'm afraid for you.
The sea is a wondrous,
mysterious, dangerous lady.
She'll make you rich
or she'll feed you
to the fishes.
You can't control her.
You got to give
yourself to her.
If she wants
you to dance,
you got
to follow her lead.
Didn't I read that
on your rest room wall?
Yes. As true today
as when I hung it there.
Hoist the mainsail.
Roger.
There's a difference
between the apparent
wind and true wind.
Watch them telltales.
That's right.
Bring her about.
Take your time.
Take your time.
She's a lady.
Give me a chance to get
the jib through the foresail.
No, no, no.
Don't pinch her.
The beam reach
is your fastest line,
- so keep your sails full.
- Hard a Lee!
How's that?
That's fine, but you can
release your sheet faster.
Uh-huh.
All right.
How's this?
Ah, that's fine.
Ah, nice.
All secure.
Here...
a graduation pin.
A hook from Scully's
Sailing School.
You're a sailor now.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate this.
You didn't
have to do this.
Ow!
A real hook, huh?
This is great.
I'm bleeding.
Is that how
you lost your hand?
Sure.
Thanks a lot.
Gregg told me
about this island
with excellent shells.
Could we go?
Sounds good.Jack?
No.
Why not?
Why not what?
Weren't you listening?
You don't even
hear us anymore.
- [Phone Ringing]
- Of course I listen.
What did I just say?
You said I don't
listen anymore.
Dad, it's for you.
Coming. See?
I heard that.
You're always with Scully.
What do you do all day?
Dance.
Hello? Yes, it is.
Oh, right. Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Well, sure. Where?
O.K.
All right.
I can be right there.
O.K., fine. Bye.
- What's up?
- Landlord's out of the hospital.
Oh, good.
I've got to go
straighten out our rent.
Hi. Glad you could make it.
I hate to do business here,
but the new owner insisted.
He knew
the principals would be here.
He wants to wrap it up.
No problem.
No problem.
I'm sorry. I thought
I was going to your office.
I feel like an idiot.
Your brother
was a great man, Floyd,
a beacon to us all.
He'll be sorely,
sorely missed.
Now I'll sign
the papers.
Could I have
a little room, please?
Mr. Pellet,
this is
Jack Chester, the tenant.
Well, well,
well, well, renter.
It looks like
you're my renter now.
I guess, uh...
I guess this
goes to you then.
It's for the last
two weeks' rent.
Oh, thank you.
It's a terrific place.
My family's
having a great time.
The best money
I ever spent.
Really?
Why you doing that?
I wouldn't
take your check
if my children
were starving.
I want you and
your family out of there
by Saturday midnight,
or I'm going to
toss you out personally.
I told you
I'd get you.
I would have given you
any amount you wanted
for that house.
And that's
the best money I ever spent.
So that's it?
We have to go home
in four days?
We can't! Gregg
was bringing me to the regatta.
I've got a date
for the regatta, too.
Shut up!
Stop saying everything I say.
I'm not leaving!
I don't care!
I'm not leaving!
- I don't care!
- [ Dog Whimpering ]
There he is.
Captain Al Pellet.
You shouldn't
have rammed him.
You should have
sunk the bastard.
He tried to
buy me out once.
It didn't work.
He got tough.
He tried to deport Cortez.
He called the Barnacle
a garbage scow.
He's a squid stick.
Squid stick.
You say so.
Can't you see we're luffing?
We're luffing!
Trim it!
Come on, trim it!
Does anybody remember
we have a race coming up?
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
We're coming
to the last part.
I'm about half
a length ahead.
He looks over.
He sees me.
He gets so frustrated,
he flips me off.
Mr. Pellet.
Hey,
landlord.
That's amazing.
I thought they were extinct.
I could swear
that's the call
of the red-beaked,
seersuckered summer renter.
And it is.
Why aren't you
home packing?
You took a vacation
away from my family.
Now I'm going to
take something away from you.
What can you
take from me?
That.
What, my cup?
Yeah.
You think you
can outsail me?
Yes.
You couldn't
beat my dinghy.
Really?
Really.
You want to bet?
What are you
going to bet?
Huh? What... popcorn?
Lobsters?
1,000 bucks.
The last two weeks' rent.
You win, we go home.
I win, we stay
two weeks rent free.
Do we have a bet?
You know
something, dumbo?
You're even stupider
than you look.
[ Gagging ]
[ Gagging Continues ]
[ Gagging ]
If I win,
we stay two weeks free!
What do you think?
I think
I'll start packing.
Jack, just suppose there's
the slightest possibility
you might
be able to win.
There's a pivotal point
that escapes me.
You don't
have a boat.
Aha! Yes, I do!
You do?
Yes. The Barnacle.
The Barnacle?
Yes.
Dad...
you're going to sail
a fish restaurant?
Well, what do you
make of my girl?
Your gunnels
to thar pinions.
Your pipswain
iw wantin' some crackin'.
I na think ya'll
crowdy yer dinpins.
S'no worse than
yer deck hoove t'gron.
That's easy
for you to say.
But what do we
do about it, Angus?
Yar fastions need
a wont of brookin'.
Ya'll ne'er be gradin'
tow wind with yar barswain.
Uh... in layman's terms,
how bad is she?
She's a total pig.
Thank you.
You're saying
she won't sail?
Hold yer wind,
you crusty scullard.
I ne'er said that.
She'll sail,
but it'll take work
and luck to find
the right sail to fit her mast.
Hacemos la suerte.
What's he sayin'?
We'll make our own luck,
you dumb Swede.
Where's Angus
with that sail?
There are only two more
shopping days left.
He's combing the entire coast.
He'll find it.
How can you be sure?
If he don't, I'll kill him.
This is too slow.
I need a power saw
attachment.
Yeah. Right.
How many
do you need?
You'd better
keep cutting.
What are they for?
I really don't know,
but we need a lot.
So, you were a sailor,
Mr. Scully?
That's right.
You must
have good vision.
Aye. Sure.
Vicki, they're perfect.
Did you tell her
they're perfect?
They're perfect.
- [Click]
- What are you doing?
Taking a dirty picture.
The filthiest version
of you I've ever seen.
What's with
Frances Farmer?
There's an outbreak
of depression.
How about you?
I'm hiding it.
Kept your dinner waiting.
I'll be back
in a couple of minutes.
He's so nice,
and Gregg's so funny.
His teacher
asked the class
what happens after
the sperm meets the egg?
And Gregg goes,
"You smoke a cigarette."
You're still
a nonsmoker, aren't you?
Daddy.
Just being a dad, that's all.
- How's the boat coming?
- It's coming. A little slow.
- Not good, huh?
- Could be better.
Hey, can't win them all.
But you'd like
to win one.
One would be nice.
Here it is.
Right here.
Dry rot.
I've got a thing for that.
I'll be
right with you.
Right, Scully.
Hey, Dad!
Hi. What's
the matter?
- We made a decision.
- We made a decision.
Yeah? About what?
We want to help
fix the Barnacle.
We thought we'd help.
Is it all right?
Yeah!
Come on aboard.
All right!
Hey, Dad.
What?
This could be the one.
Thanks.
My kids.
You knew that
already, didn't you?
- God, blad!
- I kliant neer t'frow,
but I nae canna
locayta sally.
Don't say you
can't find a sail.
I traucht nigh to bain
high upland a fiona Tampa.
Go to Tampa, then.
Aye, fiona Tampa.
You dumb Swede.
Nay dumb Swede,
dumb Scot!
Same thing. Ha!
* Holdin'our ground *
* Pullin'me down *
* Turnin'around *
* Sometimes I feel
like a propeller *
* Spin, spin
out of control *
* I don't know
who's at the throttle *
* Oh, I wish
they'd let it go *
* All I ever do
is get dizzy *
* Thinking, thinking
things left undone *

Honey.
Yeah?
Can you come up here,
a minute?
Yeah?
Painted yourself
in a corner, huh?
How do I get out?
I don't know. I did the same thing
down here. Damn!
I'd like to
propose a toast.
To my new friends
and to my best friends,
the Chesters.
To the Barnacle for all
the fun she's given us.
We've already won.
All right!
[ Cheering ]
Will the crew of the Barnacle
raise your drinks?
Is something
wrong with your arms?
You mean we're crew?
We can race with you?
What'd I say?
Daddy,
that's excellent!
We're going
to win, right?
Hell of a victory.
We'll have won
without a sail.
Why? Where's Angus?
Last time I heard,
Savannah.
I need a grand sally.
50 foot high, she be.
Sorry.
Never find her
by tomorrow.
Simpson, that better
be enough Jenny.
Yes, it is.
Tuck your shirt in, Floyd.
Look like a winner.
Be of good cheer,
Angus is here!
Angus! Angus!
[ Announcer ] Welcome to the
12th Annual Citrus Cove Regatta.
Again this year, we have
the best skippers in Florida.
The vessel to beat
is the lncisor,
skippered by Al Pellet,
winner of this event
for seven consecutive years.
We want to wish everyone
the best of luck.
The pecker
didn't show up.
He's still coughing
up that dough.
- Well, what do you know?
- What?
- We've got a late arrival.
- They just made it.
It hasn't started yet.
Well, we made it.
Haven't made
nothing yet.
Number 2 82 7...
the Barnacle.
Ain't that
a restaurant?
Look.
Well, lookie there.
It's Captain Blackhawk
and the S.S. Moveable Feast.
- [ Cheering ]
- We'll have the last laugh.
Hey, there's
Gregg and Don!
Hi!
We have a start.
Give them the gun.
The boat feels different.
What's different?
She's twice as big
as I'm used to.
Aw, she don't know that.
You'll get the feel of her.
Just follow her lead.
It's their lead
I'm worried about.
You're worried, are you?
Good. That's
the proper attitude.
It's a long race.
We'll catch them.
I hope so.
Ease off on the jib.
Ease off on the jib!
Aye, aye, Captain.
Sorry.
Mommy, can I play in
the basement with Yorku?
If it's O.K.
With Yorku.
It's O.K. I play.
I'll be here.
I'm going to head up
a little higher.
Head her up higher.
Heading up higher.
All right!
Look sharp.
Coming about!
All right.
Hard to lee!
Let's not blow it
on the first marker!
All right.
Now cleat it!
Cleat it!
The jib halyard's loose!
Prepare to come about.
Prepare to come about!
Look smart
on the foredeck!
Hard to lee!
Coming about!
Jennifer,
walk that jib across.
Aye, aye, Dad!
Angus, trim and spar
the other jib sheet.
Mainsail's too tight.
Angus,
loosen the main.
Aye.
Yorku,
you're so pretty.
Your baby's a beauty.
Set.
Good.
Jack.
Yeah.
Take off your hat
and wave.
Steady on the helm!
Dad, keep your
hand on the wheel!
Sorry.
Got it, though.
Thanks.
Have we fetched
the second marker?
No.
Damn!
They're losing us!
Prepare to jibe!
Check that turtle!
Jibe ho!
Let's get it down!
Floyd, get it down!
Prepare
for the downwind run!
Cortez,
drop the jib!
Hoist the spinnaker
rounding the marker!
Hoist, damn it!
Move!
Move! Move!
Get it up there!
Trim the backsail!
Come on! Hustle!
Easy aft.
All right, everybody!
This is it...
The run for the money.
Prepare to jibe!
Jibe ho!
Jibe ho!
Har.
Ease the pull forward
about three inches.
Take a bearing
on that last craft, Angus.
How are
we doing, Dad?
We're O.K.!
We're not closing.
Jack, you've
done beautifully,
but this old gal ain't got
nothing else to give us.
Yorku,
you think we'll win?
Yes.
What you got there?
Scrod.
Scully's Catches of the Day.
You want some?
No.
Where did you get it?
From the freezer.
Didn't I tell you
to remove all the food
and the freezer?
Oh! I think you says
don't move the food
and the freezer.
Thank God
for my bad Spanish!
Todo de abajo afuera!
Everything out!
There's pounds
of ballast down here!
We're still in this race!
Kids, help
with the garbage!
Come on! Let's go!
Everything overboard!
Todo afueras.
This old gal's got
the straightaway power
to run the bastards down!
We give the squeeze!
You're doing great, Dad!
She's on her line!
I can feel her.
Pellet,
I'm coming to get you!
Out of my way!
Eat hot waves!
We're catching up
with the big fart!
Watch your Language.
The kid's right.
He's a fart.
Thanks, Mom.
So?
They look very natural.
Vicki!
I value a judge's opinion.
Thank you.
We'll show
the people in the stands.
Good idea.
Word from the committee.
On the final leg,
the Barnacle
is moving up fast.
Damn it.
What's going on?
The bastards
stole our wind.
- They can't, can they?
- They've done it.
Can we turn the engine on
till we catch the son of a bitch?
No.
I know.
Falling off.
Stand by to trim.
- Aye.
- What the hell you doin'?
See that plane?
It's in a maverick microburst,
a low altitude
funnel gunnel.
I've seen it
at the airport a hundred times.
All right!
Go for it, boy!
Here it comes.
Here it comes.
Here we go!
Trim her in,
you dumb Swede!
Can't you see we're
in a funnel gunnel!
Aye, ya lovely sally!
We're going fast.
We're gaining.
Where'd they get
all that wind from?
Dad,
we're closing in!
You're doing great, Dad!
I want to get a picture
of Pellet as you pass him.
Make a couple
of copies for me.
We're closing in
on the scurvy bastard.
Trim the main!
They're gaining.
When I tell you
trim it, trim it!
We're beating him!
That a way, Dad!
Faster!
Faster, Dad!
We're gaining
on them!
How do we get
more speed?
Can't.
We need more sail.
Aye. Damn it.
With two more yards of sail,
we could've made it.
Scully, take the wheel.
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this moment,
the Barnacle's a real
threat to the lncisor.
We're in
a wind pocket?
Come on!
I told you
she could fly!
We're going
to beat them!
There's the finish line!
Floor it!
Go, Dad! Go!
What is it? What?
Are we
dragging something?
What is it?
Aye!
Mounty to the beasties!
We'll show you!
Come on, Dad!
Let's go!
We got it.
We're so close!
Keep it up, Dad!
Pants!
Al!
He's flying his pants, Al!
[Horn Blows]
The Barnacle
captained by Jack Chester
is the winner!
[ Cheering ]
Whoo!
We did it!
We got beat by a restaurant
wearing pants!
Trousers?
Is that legal?
I don't know, but I like it.
Yay!
We did it!
I did not hear that horn!
Daddy, did you win?
We won!
Your dad won!
Yorku, Daddy won!
Oh, wonderful!
DVDRip by cjdijk.
* Sometimes I feel
like a propeller *
* Spin, spin
out of control *
* I don't know
who's up on throttle *
* Oh, I wish
they'd let it go *
* All I ever do
is get dizzy *
* Thinkin', thinkin'
things left undone *
* Been stuck here
so long down on zero *
* I'd just like
to make it to one *
* Turnin'around *
* Heroes and clowns *
* Holdin'my ground *
* Oh, I've been down,
but I'm turnin'around *
* Turnin'around *
* Lost and
we're found *
* Holdin'our ground *
* Oh, I've been down *
* Turnin'around *
* At times I get lost
in daydreamin' *
* Sleep, sleep
my life away *
* I know in my heart
I'm a sailor *
* And my ship
is on the way *
* There never is an end
to believers *
* Lookin', lookin'
for the right sign *
* If everything will just
keep on turnin' *
* All that I want
will be mine *
* Turnin'around *
* Heroes and clowns *
* Holdin'my ground *
* Oh, I've been down,
but I'm turnin'around *
* Turnin'around *
* Lost and
we're found *
* Holdin'our ground *
* Oh, I've been down *
* Turnin'around *
* Turnin'around *
* Heroes and clowns *
* Holdin'our ground *
* Oh, I've been down,
but I'm turnin'around *
* Turnin' around *
* Lost and
we're found *
