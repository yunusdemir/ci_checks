  THE POLICE IN
 WEST MEMPHIS, ARKANSAS
CONFIRMED TODAY THAT THREE YOUNG
  BOYS WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED.
  THE BODIES OF WEAVER
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SECOND GRADERS
 STEVEN BRANCH,
   CHRISTOPHER BYERS,
AND MICHAEL MOORE
WERE PULLED FROM
 A SHALLOW CREEK EARLIER TODAY.
 THERE ARE RUMORS THAT THE BOYS
MAY HAVE BEEN SEXUALLY MUTILATED
 THE POLICE SAY
  THAT THEY DO NOT YET
HAVE ANY SUSPECTS
  IN THE CASE.
   THE MISSING 8-YEAR-OLD BOYS
 WERE DISCOVERED
   IN AN AREA KNOWN AS
ROBIN HOOD HILLS,
A SECLUDED PATCH OF WOODS
   BEHIND THE
 BLUE BEACON TRUCK WASH
   ALONG INTERSTATE 40
IN WEST MEMPHIS.
( woman )
IMAGINE ALL THE EVIL
THAT YOU COULD THINK OF,
HOW SOMEONE
COULD BE MURDERED
AND THAT'S HOW THESE
THREE CHILDREN DIED.
( man )
NO FAMILY SHOULD
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS,
   UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S GONNA
   HAPPEN AGAIN SOMEWHERE,
   ANOTHER TOWN,
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN,
I'M SURE,
 A LOT OF BAD PEOPLE
 OUT THERE IN THE WORLD.
( man )
I DON'T KNOW WHY THESE
THREE LITTLE BOYS WERE MURDERED,
DID THEY SEE SOMETHING THEY
WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO SEE ?
DID THEY HEAR THINGS
THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO HEAR ?
I DO NOT KNOW THAT,
I SEE NO REASON,
I SEE NO MOTIVE
FOR WHY THESE THREE
LITTLE BOYS WERE MURDERED.

GOOD EVENING,
I'M DIANA DAVIS.
AND I'M TONY BROOKS.
 IN A STATEMENT GIVEN TO POLICE
 OBTAINED BY A MEMPHIS NEWSPAPER
   17-YEAR-OLD
   JESSIE MISSKELLEY
  ALLEGEDLY CONFESSES
  TO WATCHING TWO OTHER SUSPECTS
   CHOKE, RAPE,
   AND SEXUALLY MUTILATE
  THREE WEST MEMPHIS
  SECOND GRADERS.
   JENNA NEWTON REPORTS.
  ACCORDING TO
  THE PUBLISHED REPORT
 MISSKELLEY TOLD POLICE
 HE WATCHED 18-YEAR-OLD
 DAMIEN ECHOLS,
 AND 16-YEAR-OLD
  JASON BALDWIN
 BRUTALIZE THE CHILDREN
WITH A CLUB AND A KNIFE.
 THE REPORT SAYS
 MISSKELLEY TOLD POLICE
   ECHOLS AND BALDWIN
  RAPED ONE OF THE BOYS
 AND SEXUALLY MUTILATED ANOTHER
AS PART OF A CULT RITUAL.
 MISSKELLEY IS QUOTED AS SAYING
  HE DID NOT TAKE PART
   IN THE RAPE AND MUTILATION
   BUT THAT HE HELPED SUBDUE
 ONE VICTIM WHO TRIED TO ESCAPE.
 AT A PRESS CONFERENCE,
  INSPECTOR GARY GITCHELL SAID
  THE CASE AGAINST THE ACCUSED
  TEENS IS VERY STRONG.
( reporter )
ONE A SCALE OF 1 TO 10,
HOW SOLID IS THE CASE ?
  ELEVEN.
  ( applause )
( Jenna )
   IT APPEARS SATANIC WORSHIP
 MAY HAVE PLAYED
 A ROLE IN THE MURDERS.
SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING
  OF THE INVESTIGATION
 PEOPLE ALL AROUND WEST MEMPHIS
HAVE COME FORWARD
  WITH STORIES
OF SATANIC CULTS.
REV. TOMMY STACY'S CHURCH
   IS DOWN THE STREET
  FROM WHERE THE BODIES
   WERE FOUND.
  ONE YEAR AGO DAMIEN ECHOLS
TOLD THE CHURCH'S YOUTH MINISTER
  HE HAD A PACT WITH THE DEVIL
AND HE WAS GOING TO HELL.
( Stacy )
I DO KNOW THAT
MY YOUTH DIRECTOR
TALKED TO DAMIEN EXTENSIVELY
AT THE REVIVAL THAT WE HAD
AND HE TOLD HIM
THAT HE COULD NOT BE SAVED.
THAT HE COULD NOT
GIVE HIS HEART TO JESUS
AND MY YOUTH DIRECTOR THEN
TRIED TO GET HIM
TO TAKE A BIBLE
AND HE MADE THE STATEMENT
THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE A BIBLE
BECAUSE IF HE DID,
THE REST OF 'EM WOULD GET HIM.
IN WEST MEMPHIS,
  JENNA NEWTON,
   <i> KAIT 8 NIGHT NEWS.</i>
CHRISTOPHER NEVER
HURT ANYBODY.
HE HAD A GENTLE,
LOVING AND GIVING HEART.
AND THEY CRUCIFIED HIM
IN THOSE WOODS,
AND THEY HUMILIATED
HIS LITTLE BODY.
THEY TOOK
HIS LITTLE MANHOOD
BEFORE HE EVEN
KNEW WHAT IT WAS.
AND I HATE 'EM FOR IT.
I'VE NEVER HATED ANYBODY
IN MY<i> LIFE.</i>
AND I HATE THESE THREE.
AND THE MOTHERS
THAT BORE THEM.
I CAN'T IMAGINE...
WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH MICHAEL'S MIND.
 WAS HE...
 CALLING FOR ME ?
( Todd )
HOW LONG DID THEY
LEAVE HIM THERE TIED UP
ON THAT DITCH BANK BEFORE
THEY DECIDED TO KILL HIM ?
WHAT WERE THEY
DOING TO HIM ?
WAS HE CONSCIOUS
OR UNCONSCIOUS ?
   DID HE WATCH
   THE OTHER TWO BOYS...
   GET CUT ?
( Todd )
HE WAS REALLY BEING KILLED
BY REAL MONSTERS.
  ( laughs )
ON TV !
PAM, FIRST OF ALL
WHAT ARE YOU HOLDING
IN YOUR HAND THERE ?
  IT'S STEVIE'S
  BOY SCOUT,
 I GOT IT
 BACK YESTERDAY.
   AND, I'VE BEEN WEARING IT
   AROUND MY HEAD LIKE THIS.
DID HE
LIKE SCOUTING ?
OH, HE LOVED IT,
HE LOVED IT.
HE LOVED IT.
( reporter )
DO YOU BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THIS ?
 ( Pam )
 I HAVE, I HAVE,
I HAVE BEEN
ON A GUILT TRIP ABOUT IT
 BUT, IT WASN'T MY FAULT
 I WAS AT WORK.
HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED
JOINING STEVIE ?
HAVE I ?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT SUICIDE ?
HAVE I ?
 UH, "SUICIDE" ?
I FELT LIKE DYING,
BUT NOT SUICIDE, NO,
NOT SUICIDE.
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE PEOPLE
THAT DID THIS WERE WORSHIPPING--
SATAN ?
  YES, I DO.
WHY ?
JUST LOOK AT THE FREAKS.
   JUST LOOK AT 'EM.
   THEY LOOK LIKE PUNKS.
LITTLE JESSIE TOLD ME
HE DIDN'T DO IT,
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH IT, HE WASN'T THERE.
I BELIEVE<i> HIM.</i>
( Jessie Sr. )
I THINK THE COPS JUST
CAN'T FIND WHO DONE IT...
AND THEY GOTTA
PUT IT ON SOMEBODY.
I WANNA TELL THE WHOLE WORLD
MY SON'S INNOCENT
 BECAUSE I KNOW
 HE<i> IS</i> INNOCENT.
 ( Gail )
 I KNOW WHERE HE WAS
AND I KNOW HE'S INNOCENT
   AND I WANNA TELL THE WORLD
   AND I WANT THE WORLD TO KNOW.
  THIS BOY
  IS NOT CAPABLE
 OF THE CRIME
  THAT HE HAS
  BEEN ARRESTED FOR.
I'VE SEEN HIM
TAKE A LITTLE KITTEN
   AND LOVE IT JUST LIKE
   YOU'D LOVE A LITTLE BABY.
  IT'S LIKE A NIGHTMARE,
 A NIGHTMARE THAT
 YOU CAN'T WAKE UP FROM.
OUR SON IS INNOCENT.
  WE INTEND TO PROVE IT.
  ( man )
  "YAY, THOUGH
  I WALK THROUGH THE VALLEY
 "OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH
  "I SHALL FEAR NO EVIL.
"AND I'M NOT
SCARED OF THE DEVIL.
"I GOTTA KNOW
WHO MY COMFORTER IS.
 THOU ROD AND THOU STAFF
 COMFORT ME."
  AND I THANK YOU LORD
  FOR LETTIN' ME BE ABLE
  TO BELIEVE IN THAT
  WITH ALL MY HEART.
 I HOPE Y'ALL REALLY BELIEVE
 IN YOUR MASTER THE SATAN,
THAT SLEUTHFOOT,
DEVIL HIMSELF,
  BECAUSE HE'S NOT
  GONNA HELP YA.
 HE'S GONNA LAUGH AT YA,
 MOCK AT YA, AND TORTURE YA.
 HE DIDN'T NEED YOUR HELP.
 THE DEVIL'S GOT
 ALL THE DEVILS HE NEEDS.
 THE GOOD LORD SAID LUCIFER,
 AND A THIRD OF THE ANGELS
 WERE CAST FROM HEAVEN.
 HE DIDN'T NEED THEM,
 BUT HE TOOK THEIR MIND
 AND HE MANIPULATED 'EM,
AND THEY PRAYED TO SATAN
AND THEY PRAYED TO THE DEVIL
AND THEY HAD THEIR SATANIC
WORSHIP SERVICES OUT HERE,
AND THEY HAD ALL TYPES
OF WILD HOMOSEXUAL ORGIES
I'VE BEEN TOLD,
CRAZY THINGS.
TO ME,
THIS PLACE AS I STAND
IS LIKE HELL ON EARTH
BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THREE BABIES
WERE KILLED RIGHT OUT HERE
WERE I STAND.
I KNOW MY SON WAS CASTRATED
AND POSSIBLY
LAYED THERE ON THAT BANK
AND BLED TO DEATH.
I KNOW HE WAS CHOKED.
I KNOW ONE BOY'S HEAD
WAS BEAT IN BEYOND RECOGNITION.
I KNOW ONE LITTLE BOY
WAS SKINNED
ALMOST LIKE AN ANIMAL,
CUT, HAD TO SHAVE HIS HEAD,
HAD ALL TYPES
OF INJURES TO THE HEAD
WHERE THEY JUST
KEPT BEATING HIM
AND POUNDIN' ON HIM,
AND KILLIN' HIM AND KILLIN' HIM
IT'S LIKE THEY ENJOYED IT,
THEY KILLED THEM
TWO OR THREE TIMES.
JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR,
JASON BALDWIN,
DAMIEN ECHOLS,
I HOPE YOUR MASTER THE DEVIL
DOES TAKE YOU SOON.
I WANT YOU TO
MEET HIM<i> REAL</i> SOON.
AND THE DAY YOU DIE
I'M GONNA PRAISE GOD
AND I MAKE YOU
A PROMISE,
THE DAY YOU DIE,
EVERY YEAR ON MAY 5TH
I'M GONNA COME
TO YOUR GRAVE SIDE,
I'M GONNA SPIT ON YOU,
I'M GONNA CURSE
THE DAY YOU WERE BORN,
AND I'M SURE
WHILE I'M STANDIN' THERE
I'M GONNA HAVE TO HAVE
OTHER BODILY FUNCTIONS
LET GO UPON YOUR GRAVE.
I PROMISE YOU
AS GOD IS MY WITNESS
I'LL VISIT ALL THREE
OF YOUR GRAVES.
THE STATEMENT
JESSIE GAVE TO THE POLICE
IS A LIE,
IT'S NOT TRUE.
I DON'T SEE WHY HE WOULD
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT
TO ANOTHER PERSON.
I CAN SEE WHY THEY MIGHT THINK
I WAS IN A CULT
 'CAUSE I WEAR<i>
 METALLICA</i> T-SHIRTS AND STUFF.
BUT, I'M NOT IN
NOTHIN' LIKE THAT.
 I COULDN'T KILL AN ANIMAL<i>
 OR</i> A PERSON.
I DON'T WORSHIP THE DEVIL
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
I WORSHIP GOD
LIKE EVERY NORMAL PERSON
AROUND HERE DOES.
I GOT A FAVORITE PET,
MY PET IGUANA.
HAD HER FOR A LITTLE
OVER A YEAR NOW.
I USUALLY GO FISHIN'
BY MYSELF,
RIGHT IN MY BACKYARD.
JUST GO OUT THERE, AND MY
PET CAT WOULD BE OUT THERE
HIS NAME'S CHARLIE.
WHENEVER I CATCH A FISH
I ALWAYS GIVE IT TO HIM.
I DIDN'T KILL THESE
THREE LITTLE BOYS.
I DIDN'T KILL
THOSE THREE LITTLE BOYS.
THEY WERE UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE
THEY HAD TO FIND<i> SOMEBODY</i>
TO LAY THIS OFF ON
BEFORE PEOPLE
STARTED LOSIN' THEIR JOBS.
THE PUBLIC WAS
GETTIN' REAL UPSET
SEEIN' THE COPS
WERE INCOMPETENT,
COULDN'T DO THEIR JOBS,
THEY HAD TO DO SOMETHING FAST.
AND WE WERE REALLY
THE OBVIOUS CHOICE
BECAUSE WE STOOD OUT
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.
THIS ALL WORKED OUT
TO THEIR ADVANTAGE.
( man )
NO ONE'S GONNA BE SAYING THAT
YOU'RE STUPID OR YOU'RE DUMB,
OR MAKING FUN OF YOU,
BUT THE COURT'S GONNA BE
VERY INTERESTED IN DETERMINING
EXACTLY AT WHAT LEVEL
YOU WERE FUNCTIONING,
HOW WELL
YOU'RE ABLE TO READ,
HOW WELL YOU'RE ABLE TO WRITE,
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ?
 MM-HMM.
SO, IF THE COURT
DETERMINES THAT
YOU ARE OPERATING
BELOW AVERAGE,
THEN THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT
THE COURT WILL NOT BE ALLOWED
OR THE STATE
WILL NOT BE ALLOWED
TO IMPOSE
THE DEATH PENALTY AGAINST YOU,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT THAT MEANS ?
WE'VE GOT
ABOUT 10 WEEKS
BEFORE THE TRIAL
COMES UP IN JANUARY.
ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD
TO HAVING THE TRIAL ?
   A LITTLE BIT.
 NOT MUCH.
( phone rings )
HELLO ?
  ( operator )
  I have a collect call,
  your name please.
( man )
Jessie.
  ( operator )
  Will you pay ?
YES, MA'AM.
  Thank you.
HEY, SON,
HOW YA DOIN' ?
Alright.
THAT'S GOOD.
 My hand
still hurts.
YOUR HAND STILL HURTS ?
DID YOU EVER FIND OUT
IF IT WAS BROKE OR NOT ?
 No, I ain't
 found out.
  I can move it.
IF YOU CAN MOVE IT,
IT'S NOT BROKE.
   It hurts.
IF YOU CAN MOVE IT,
IT'S NOT BROKE.
IT'S GONNA HURT A WHILE 'CAUSE
YOU BRUISED IT PRETTY GOOD.
YOU JUST GOTTA LEARN
NOT TO HIT THEM WALLS
HIT SOMEBODY ELSE.
 There was nobody
 in my room to<i> hit.</i>
OH, OKAY.
  I didn't hit the wall,
  I hit the commode.
YOU "HIT THE COMMODE" ?
  Yeah, I hit it
  on the side.
I didn't even
put a dent in it either.
  That must be
 a hard commode.
I HEARD THAT.
   What time is everyone
   gonna come up ?
I DON'T KNOW.
Y'all come up anytime,
'cause y'all be in here with me.
WELL, UH...
WE'LL SEE YOU SATURDAY.
( man )
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GO THROUGH THE METAL DETECTOR
WHEN YOU COME THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR,
I WANT EVERYBODY
TO DO THAT,
THEY'VE GOT THAT PORTABLE THING
THEY CAN BRING FROM LITTLE ROCK
IF YOU NEED IT.
LIKE THE AIRPORT DEAL.
   WE COULDN'T AFFORD
   NO $3,000 METAL DETECTOR.
 WHAT I PLANNED ON DOIN'
 WAS USIN' TWO PORTABLES
  AT THIS DOOR,
THAT'S WHY I WANT EVERYBODY,
OUTSIDE OF LAWYERS,
  AND I WANT THEM
  TO COME THROUGH THIS DOOR.
THERE'S A POTENTIAL
OF A PROBLEM AREA
  WITH THE...
STRONG FEELINGS
OF THE FAMILY,
  AND THAT'S
  TO BE UNDERSTOOD
SO, SECURITY, NOT ONLY COMING
IN AND OUT OF THE COURTROOM
IS A PROBLEM,
BUT KEEPING THE ONLOOKERS
AND THE FAMILY
AND PEOPLE SEGREGATED
FROM THE ACCUSED
IS ANOTHER PROBLEM
THAT YOU'LL HAVE, DARWIN.
MY INTENTION WAS
TO BRING THIS BOY IN
   BEFORE, LONG BEFORE COURT
  AND HAVE HIM IN SIGHT.
( man )
OBVIOUSLY I'M VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT SECURITY.
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF
THE DEATH THREATS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED,
BUT I DON'T WANNA GIVE
THE JURY THE IMPRESSION,
  IF WE HAVE
  20 STATE TROOPERS
  AND 50 COUNTY DEPUTIES,
  IT'S GONNA GIVE
  THE IMPRESSION TO THE JURY
  THAT MY CLIENT IS
  A VERY DANGEROUS PERSON
  WHICH HE'S NOT,
  AND I DON'T WANT THE JURY
  TO GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION,
  I DON'T WANT THERE TO BE
  SUCH A CIRCUS IN THE COURTROOM
  WITH REPORTERS AND CAMERAS
  THAT THE JURY FORGETS ABOUT
  WHAT THEY'RE HERE FOR
  AND THAT IS
  TO ADMINISTER JUSTICE.
( man )
WE EXPECT THE PROOF'S
GOING TO SHOW
THAT THIS DEFENDANT CONFESSED,
THAT HE WAS NOT COERCED...
WE DO NOT CONTEND THAT THE
PROOF'S GOING TO SHOW
THAT EVERY WORD THAT
CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH
WAS THE TRUTH.
( defense )
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY
THIS STATEMENT THAT
MR. MISSKELLEY GAVE
THE WEST MEMPHIS
POLICE DEPARTMENT
IS A FALSE STORY,
THE INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES
THAT WERE DEPLOYED AGAINST HIM
AT THE TIME OF HIS STATEMENT
ON JUNE THE 3RD
RENDERED HIM
COMPLETELY INCAPABLE...
THEY BROKE HIS WILL,
THEY SCARED HIM
BEYOND ALL MEASURES.
THE PROOF IS GOING TO SHOW
THAT THIS DEFENDANT
WAS AN ACCOMPLICE
TO DAMIEN ECHOLS
AND JASON BALDWIN
IN THE COMMISSION OF THESE
HORRIFYING MURDERS
AND WE WILL ASK YOU
TO RETURN YOUR
VERDICT OF GUILTY
ON THREE COUNTS
OF CAPITAL MURDER.
   ( woman )
   WE DON'T<i> KNOW</i>
   WHAT THE TRUTH IS
 BUT WHEN IT REALLY
 GETS DOWN TO IT...
  HIS DADDY AND I ARE GONNA
  LOOK HIM SCARE IN THE EYES
   AND SAY, SON,
   DID YOU DO THIS ?
WAS YOU EVEN THERE ?
THAT'S WHEN
WE WILL BELIEVE.
IF HE TOLD ME HE DID IT...
WHICH I DON'T
BELIEVE HE DID,
BUT IF HE TOLD ME
HE DID IT...
HE'D HAVE TO DO HIS TIME.
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
   ( Lee )
   IF HE ADMITS TO THIS,
HE WOULD BE
STRICTLY ON HIS OWN.
WE WOULDN'T EVEN SEND HIM A
DOLLAR FOR A PACK OF CIGARETTES.
NO, YOU'RE
WRONG THERE.
  YES, WE WOULD.
NO, I WOULD,
HE'S MY SON.
I'LL SEND HIM MONEY.
BUT, HE WILL
HAVE TO DO HIS TIME.
  I WOULDN'T
  GIVE HIM A<i> NICKEL.</i>
HE'S MY SON.
 WE CAN BE
 TALKIN' ABOUT--
   WE COULD BE
   TALKING ABOUT<i> MY</i> SON.
 IF MY SON DID SOMETHING
 THAT<i> HORRIBLE.</i>
  NO, I WOULDN'T
  GIVE HIM A NICKEL.
  LET HIM SUFFER.
YOU CAN'T TURN
YOUR BLOOD AWAY.
  I DON'T KNOW HOW
  YOU SAY YOU COULD,
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A PROBLEM OVER THIS.
BUT, I KNOW HOW IT IS
BEING UP THERE IN JAIL
WITHOUT ANYTHING.
   WELL, THAT'S
   BESIDE THE POINT,
  IF HE'S GUILTY
IF HE'S GUILTY OF DOING THIS
TO THESE LITTLE BOYS.
   NO.
HE'S NOT.
 WELL I'M SAYING
 HE'S NOT<i> TOO.</i>
BUT,
  IF HE HAPPENS TO--
  IF IT'S PROVEN.
  NO, FORGET IT, NO.
 NO.
I DON'T BELIEVE
HE DID IT.
I'LL NEVER
BELIEVE HE DID IT.
THIS IS TO JESSIE JR.
TODAY'S HIS 18TH BIRTHDAY.
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TO GO SEE HIM AT,
I'M GONNA SING
"HAPPY BIRTHDAY" TO HIM.

   ( laughs )
  ( woman )
  NOW, HE'S LEGAL
  TO GET 'EM, AIN'T HE ?
( Jessie Sr. )
YEAH, HE'S LEGAL
TO SMOKE NOW.
  ( woman )
  I MAY NOT BE
  HIS BIOLOGICAL MOTHER
  BUT GIVING BIRTH
  DON'T MAKE A PARENT,
  AND I'VE HAD HIM
  SINCE HE WAS FOUR...
  AND IT TOOK ME
  ABOUT A YEAR
TO ASSURE THAT LITTLE BOY
I WAS GONNA BE HERE FOR HIM,
   HE WOULDN'T WANNA
   GO TO SCHOOL
 HE WOULDN'T
 GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY
   BECAUSE WAS AFRAID I WOULDN'T
   BE HERE WHEN HE CAME IN
 AND WHEN HE WAS IN KINDERGARTEN
 IF HE'D COME IN
AND I HAPPENED NOT TO BE
WHERE HE CAN SEE ME
   WHEN HE FIRST COME IN
 HE WOULD BE HYSTERICAL
 WHEN I GOT TO HIM.
AND...
   I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT...
HE WAS...
   HE HAD A PROBLEM.
 AND I,
 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
 REAL PROTECTIVE OF HIM.
MY MOM SENT ME THIS ONE.
  "THERE ARE
  ALL SORTS OF SONS
"SONS CAN BE SLOUCHY
 "SONS CAN BE SWEET
 "SONS CAN BE GROUCHY...
  "SONS CAN BE NEAT
  "SONS CAN BE BROKE

   AND IT SAYS
   "HAPPY BIRTHDAY".
( Jessie )
I CRY A LOT
WHEN I'M IN HERE
'CAUSE I MISS MY FAMILY
AND EVERYTHING.
AND I JUST CRY A LOT.
AFTER THAT, I GO TO BED,
TRY TO SLEEP.
( woman )
MY NAME IS
ELLA SANDERS,
MY SON WAS
ANTONIO SANDERS,
AND HE GOT KILLED,
HALLOWEEN NIGHT, 1990.
( woman )
MY NAME IS BRENDA McCLAINE
AND MY BROTHER
WAS STABBED TO DEATH.
( woman )
I'M BRENDA EAST
AND MY SON, ROBERT,
23 AT THE TIME
WAS MURDERED
IN 1990.
MY NAME'S ANNE WALLEN
MY DAUGHTER WAS
SHEILA DIXON
SHE WAS MURDERED
JANUARY THE 12TH OF '91.
I'M WANDA RANY.
MY DAUGHTER WAS MURDERED,
JUNE THE 27TH,
WE THINK,
WE'RE NOT SURE,
THEY'RE CALLING IT
A CRIME OF PASSION,
THEY NOT ONLY
THROWED HER OUT
AND LET HER LAY
TWO WEEKS,
HE POURED ACID ON HER
TO DETERIORATE HER BODY.
I DIDN'T
HAVE THE PLEASURE...
OF TELLING
MY DAUGHTER GOOD-BYE.
FUNERAL WAS
CLOSED CASKET...
AND THIS IS WHAT
I HAD ON THE CASKET.
AND IT'S STILL
VERY UNREAL TO ME.
WHEN THE TELEPHONE RINGS
I EXPECT IT TO BE HER.
MY NAME'S TODD MOORE.
MY SON WAS MARK MOORE,
HE WAS MURDERED ALONG WITH
CHRISTOPHER BYERS
AND STEVEN BRANCH
MAY 5TH, 1993.
I CANNOT
DESCRIBE THE PAIN...
THAT MY FAMILY
HAS WENT THROUGH
THEY DIDN'T
JUST KILL MY SON
THEY KILLED PART OF ME.
THEY KILLED A PART
OF MY WIFE,
HER DAUGHTER.
I'M SO FRUSTRATED
   BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE
   THEY HAVE SO MUCH RIGHTS,
  WE HAVE NO RIGHTS,
   THEY HAD IN THE PAPER
   THE OTHER DAY,
   NOW THE TAXPAYERS
   IN GRITON COUNTY
   ARE GONNA HAVE TO
   BUY THEM A SUIT
 BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT
 THEM TO GO INTO COURT
   LOOKING LIKE
   WHAT THEY ARE, CRIMINALS.
  THEY'RE IN JAIL,
  THEY SHOULD WEAR JAIL CLOTHES.
   WHY DO THEY NEED TO HAVE
   A NICE SUIT
   BOUGHT BY THE COUNTY
   SO THEY
   LOOK PRESENTABLE ?
 THEY DON'T WANT 'EM
 IN SHACKLES AND CHAINS.
 YOU KNOW, THESE ARE NOT
 BOYS THAT MURDERED
 OUR KIDS.
THEY STOPPED BEING BOYS
WHEN THEY PLANNED THIS,
 AND I SIT THERE
 AND WATCH THEIR PARENTS
COMIN' OUT OF COURTS, CRYING
 TALKIN' ABOUT
 THEIR SON'S RIGHTS.
  WHAT ABOUT
 <i> OUR</i> SON'S RIGHTS ?
   WHERE THE HELL WAS HIS RIGHTS
   OUT ON THAT DITCH BANK ?
  HE HAD NO RIGHTS,
   HE HAD THE RIGHTS
   TO BE BRUTALLY MURDERED ?
  TO BE BEAT TO DEATH,
  AN 8-YEAR-OLD LITTLE BOY ?
  WHERE WAS HIS RIGHTS ?
( woman )
I'M DIANE MOORE,
MICHAEL MOORE'S MOTHER,
LAST WEEK IN
FLASH MARKET,
THE ECHOL'S MAN WAS IN THERE
STARING ME DOWN.
LIKE IT WAS MY FAULT
THAT I HAD A CHILD
THAT HIS CHILD
COULD MURDER.
WE SEEN
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE
SUPPORTING THESE PEOPLE,
THAT LOOK AT US
LIKE WE'RE SCUM,
AND THESE OTHER PEOPLE
ARE JUST...
THE GREATEST THING
THAT THEY'VE EVER KNOWN,
NOW THEY WANNA
HAVE 'EM ALL
JUST DRESSED UP
AND ACT LIKE
LITTLE CHOIR BOYS IN COURT.
HERE YOU GO, HE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.
MY SON DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
HE'S JUST A BOY.
( man )
NOW, ON JUNE THE 3RD
DID YOU HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT
TO LOCATE A PARTICULAR PERSON ?
MY ASSIGNMENT WAS TO CONTACT
JESSIE MISKELLEY JR.
   AT THAT TIME WAS
   THE DEFENDANT A SUSPECT ?
( Allen )
NO, SIR.
 ( prosecutor )
 IF HE WAS NOT A SUSPECT
   WHY WERE YOU ASSIGNED
   TO CONTACT HIM ?
  HE WAS A FRIEND WITH--
  FRIENDS WITH DAMIEN ECHOLS
  AND JASON BALDWIN.
  WHAT, IF ANYTHING,
  DID HE TELL YOU...
 DURING THIS CONVERSATION
 BEFORE THE TAPE RECORDING ?
HE TOLD US
THAT HE HAD ATTENDED
SOME SATANIC
CULT-TYPE MEETINGS,
THAT BOYS,
ALONG WITH GIRLS
WOULD ATTEND,
THERE WOULD BE
SESSIONS OF SEX,
ORGIES,
AS HE CALLED THEM.
UH, THAT...
DOGS AND ANIMALS
HAD BEEN KILLED
AND IN FACT
THOSE ANIMALS,
PORTIONS OF THEM,
HAVE BEEN
EATEN BY THE MEMBERS.

JESSIE WAS SITTIN'--
HE WAS SITTIN'
RIGHT DOWN HERE.
   I HAD SEEN THE POLICE
   OVER THERE TWICE.
 I'D ALSO SEEN
LITTLE JESSIE OVER THERE
  AND THEY
  TALKED TO HIM.
POLICE OFFICERS
TALKED TO HIM.
   YES, SIR.
THEY HAD TO FIND SOMEBODY
TO PIN THIS ON.
THIS PUBLICITY
WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND.
 ( man )
 CAN YOU ASK THOSE FOLKS INSIDE
 TO STEP OUT FOR JUST A SECOND ?
 I KNOW THAT
 I'VE TALKED TO EACH OF YOU,
IF NOT DIRECTLY,
INDIRECTLY,
  WE NEED TO BE
  VERY, VERY CAREFUL
ABOUT WHO WE TALK TO
WITH REGARD TO THE MEDIA
INVOLVED IN THIS CASE.
 THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS
 OF THE MEDIA WHO APPARENTLY
 HAVE NO ETHICS
   AND HAVE DECIDED THAT THEY'RE
   GONNA DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN
  TO DIG UP MUD
  AND SLING MUD,
  IT'S NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
  BUT HURT JESSIE
 AND HIS CHANCES OF
 RECEIVING A FAIR TRIAL.
   YOU, AS FRIENDS OF JESSIE
   AND RELATIVES OF JESSIE,
 ARE PRIME TARGETS FOR
 THESE MEMBERS OF THE PRESS.
 AND IF WE JUST REMEMBER
 THE ONE RULE IS
  DON'T TALK TO ANYBODY, THEN WE
  WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
  DOES THAT MAKE SENSE ?
  SO, AGAIN I CAUTION YOU NOT TO
  TALK TO ANYBODY IN THE PRESS,
  IT'S JUST
  GONNA HURT US, THANKS.

( Mark )
ONE THING I LIKE
ABOUT THIS RIGHT HERE,
BLACK POWDER GUN,
IS THEY CAN'T PULL ANY TYPE
OF BALLISTICS ON IT,
IF BY SOME CHANCE YOU WAS
TO SHOOT SOMETHING WITH IT,
EVERY BULLET RIFLES
THROUGH THE CHAMBER
JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
SO, THEY JUST CAN'T PULL
NO BALLISTICS OFF THIS ONE.
THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE I WOULDN'T
MIND SHOOTING WITH IT.
BUT, HOPEFULLY THE COURTS
AND THE JUSTICE SYSTEM'S
GONNA TAKE CARE OF 'EM.
IF THEY REACH PRISON,
THEY'LL GET TOOK CARE OF.
( Mark )
TODD, I COULD SAVE THE STATE
A LOT OF MONEY.
IF THEY JUST LET ME LINE
THEM THREE SONOFAGUNS UP,
I'D SAY THIS ONE HERE
IS FOR YOU JESSIE,
AND WE'RE GONNA GO
FOR THE JUG OF WATER.
OH, JESSIE, I DONE BLOWED YOU
HALF IN TWO, SON !
THIS ONE HERE'S
FOR YOU, DAMIEN,
YOU THAT BLACK CIRCLE
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.
OH, YOU GOT HURT.
( Todd )
DAMN, THAT SURE LOOKED
PAINFUL, DIDN'T IT ?
 HEY, JASON ?
I WANT YOU TO SMILE AND
BLOW ME A KISS FOR THIS ONE.
LET'S GO BACK
TO JESSIE.
I JUST WOUNDED HIM,
I WANT HIM TO BLEED A LITTLE BIT
LIKE HE MADE MY BABY BLEED.
OH, JESSIE...
THAT BREAKS MY HEART
THINKIN' ABOUT THAT SCUM.
'CAUSE THIS RIGHT HERE'S ALL
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO HIM,
SHOT SLOWLY,
WITH A REAL NICE FIREARM.
AND IT AIN'T GOT
NO CONSIDERATION
OR NO FEELING
WHO IT'S AIMIN' AT,
JUST LIKE THEY DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT KILLING MY BABY.
   I'D BE HAPPY WITH
   LINING THEM UP.
 I WOULDN'T HAVE
 NO PROBLEM WITH IT.
 I THINK OLD JESSIE'S
 STILL KICKIN' A LITTLE.
  PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.
WHAT KIND OF RANGE
DO WE GOT IN THE COURTROOM ?
 PROBABLY ABOUT
 10 FOOT RIGHT HERE.
 GO AHEAD AND
 WASTE OLD JESSIE.
I DON'T SEE THAT BEIN'
MUCH OF A PROBLEM.
NO, BECAUSE
I CAN JUST SEE THE SCUM.
THAT'S GOOD.
GO AHEAD,
HE'S WIGGLING,
ALRIGHT,
I COULD LIVE WITH THAT.
  ( prosecution )
  DURING THE COURSE
  OF THESE CONVERSATIONS
WAS ANYTHING
SHOWN TO THE DEFENDANT ?
 YES, SIR.
   ALRIGHT, WHAT WAS
   SHOWN TO HIM ?
   THERE WAS A PICTURE THAT
   INSP. GITCHELL SHOWED HIM.
 AND WHAT WAS
 THAT A PICTURE OF ?
( man )
ONE OF THE VICTIMS.
WHEN I SHOWED JESSIE
THIS PHOTOGRAPH,
HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HAND
AND HE JUST WENT BACK
IN HIS CHAIR LIKE THIS,
AND HE JUST LOCKED IN ON IT,
FIXED IN
ON THE PHOTOGRAPH,
AND JUST KEPT STARING AT IT
AND STARING AT IT.
   INITIALLY, MR. MISSKELLEY
 DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT
 WHATSOEVER IN THIS, DIDN'T HE ?
 YES, SIR, HE DID.
  OFFICER RIDGE,
THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT WAS JUST
INTRODUCED INTO EVIDENCE,
   DEPICTING ONE OF
   THE BOY'S BODIES,
  THAT WAS SHOWN TO JESSIE ?
  YES.
   AND THIS WAS
   IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO HIM
  ADMITTING AND
  TELLING YOU THIS STORY
 ABOUT BEING PRESENT
 WHEN THE BOYS WERE KILLED ?
 SHORTLY BEFORE,
 YES, SIR.
  WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THAT ?
THERE HAD TO BE
A REASON TO DO THAT.
 ( Ridge )
 THERE WERE TIMES WHEN JESSIE
 WOULD NOT BE TALKING,
 HE'S GETTING SLOWER
 WITH INFORMATION,
 HE'S TELLING US THINGS,
 IT'S OVER AND OVER,
 THE SAME THING.
 THOSE TECHNIQUES ARE USED
 TO EVOKE A RESPONSE.
( defense )
YOU AND INSP. GITCHELL
DID THESE THINGS
   TO EVOKE A RESPONSE.
YES, SIR.
   TO EVOKE CONFESSION.
EVOKE A RESPONSE,
KEEP HIM TALKING.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
 THAT MR. MISSKELLEY
 HAS A MENTAL HANDICAP ?
NO, SIR, IT DIDN'T TO ME
ON THAT DATE.
DID YOU HAVE
ANY SPECIAL TRAINING
 DEALING WITH PEOPLE
 WITH MENTAL HANDICAPS ?
( Ridge )
NO, SIR.
 ( defense )
 DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
 THAT THIS WAS GONNA SCARE HIM,
 SHOWING HIM A
 PICTURE OF A BODY ?
THAT IT WOULD SCARE HIM ?
I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS HE'S SCARED
INTO MAKING A STATEMENT,
YES, SIR.
 ( Jessie )
 I'm getting nervous
 every day.
 WHY ?
 Why ?!
OH, OKAY.
   That's a stupid question.
( Susie )
OKAY.
I can barely
hold this phone.
  It's getting
  closer and closer.
I don't wanna
even think about it.
 I can imagine what
 they're gonna do to me.
  I can imagine.
  But, I'm not gonna
  think that though.
( Susie )
THINK GOOD THOUGHTS,
WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING GOOD
WHILE I'M ON THE PHONE.
HEY, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TALKING TO ME,
NOT YOUR FRIENDS.
These people
make me mad.
   You know it ?
UH-HUH.
   They get to go out and
   screw people and I can't.
   That's what y'all do,
   I can't do that.
WELL, YOU WILL LATER.
   I will later ?
   How do you know ?
   I mean if I can
   get out, we will.
 If I don't get out,
 we won't.
What I was gonna
ask you that Sunday,
   That I dreamed about you.
You wouldn't believe
what I was dreaming.
  It freaked me out.
 Wanna hear it ?
   Huh ?
( Susie )
YEAH.
  We was having sex,
  alright ?
O.K.
We went to the bathroom,
we had sex.
When I was going out
the front door
 We had sex right there.
We done it
out in the yard,
 In front of everybody.
 It freaked me out !
 I woke up,
 I was sweatin' bad.
I said I hope that dream
come true quick.
What are you gonna do
when you get off the phone ?
SNEAK BACK HOME.
  Go back home ?
 I'm gonna go back home too,
 when I get off the phone.
I WISH YOU COULD.
I WISH YOU COULD.
   Yeah.
  Well, my time's up, okay ?
  I gotta go, okay ?
 I love you.
I LOVE YOU TOO.
Bye-bye.
  ( hangs up phone )
CAN YOU GET
IT IN THERE ?
YEAH.
   I THINK THOSE TWO
   OUGHTA DO FINE.
YEAH, I'M SURE
THEY WILL BE.
YEAH, THIS ONE'S GOOD.
THIS ONE CAME OUT.
 O.K.
( Mark )
BIG DIFFERENCE FROM
ANY OTHER CHRISTMAS.
  ( Mark )
  ONE I'LL NEVER FORGET.
( Melissa )
IT'S THE FIRST ONE
WITHOUT HIM.
I WISH YOU COULD'VE
BEEN HERE TO HEAR ME SING.
HE LIKED TO HEAR ME SING.
THIS LITTLE CHRISTMAS TREE
WILL STAY THERE REAL WELL,
IT'S IN THERE
TIGHT ENOUGH,
I DON'T THINK THE WIND WILL
BLOW IT OVER OR ANYTHING.
   C'MERE AND
   KNEEL DOWN HERE BY ME.
   OH, GOD, WHY DID
   YOU LET THIS HAPPEN ?
  PLEASE HELP US
  THROUGH IT.
   GOD, PLEASE
   HELP US THROUGH THIS.
( man )
THIS IS AN ENLARGED PHOTOGRAPH
OF THE CRIME SCENE,
THIS IS THE DITCH
WHERE THE BODIES
WERE FOUND,
MICHAEL MOORE WAS FOUND
IN THIS AREA AT THE BOTTOM,
STEVE BRANCH WAS FOUND
JUST BEHIND
WHERE THESE TREES ARE
IN THE STREAM,
AND CHRISTOPHER BYERS
WAS FOUND JUST BELOW,
THAT BODY RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS EXHIBIT 22,
WHICH IS THE BODY
OF MICHAEL MOORE,
AFTER REMOVING HIM
FROM THE WATER.
THE WAY HE WAS FOUND.
THIS IS THE BODY
OF STEVE BRANCH,
STEVE BRANCH
IS THE ONE THAT HAD
THE INJURES TO HIS FACE.
 ( prosecutor )
 WAS IT A PARTICULAR
 PART OF HIS FACE ?
( man )
THE LEFT SIDE.
THIS IS STATE EXHIBIT 24,
THE BODY OF
CHRISTOPHER BYERS.
  ( prosecutor )
  WHAT KIND OF INJURES
  DID CHRIS BYERS HAVE,
   DID YOU OBSERVE ?
IT LOOKED AS THOUGH
HIS PENIS HAD BEEN REMOVED.
( sobs )
COULD YOU SEE THE PICTURES
FROM WHERE YOU WERE SITTING ?
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I HAD TO LEAVE.
   WHY ?
  BECAUSE I ALWAYS--
SEEING MY
BOY THE WAY HE WAS,
   I'LL ALWAYS HAVE THAT PICTURE
   OF WHAT HE LOOKED LIKE,
 IN MY MIND.
BUT, YOU NEVER
KNEW UNTIL NOW.
 YOU SAID EARLY ON
 YOU REALLY
 DIDN'T WANNA KNOW.
 BUT, NOW YOU'RE HEARING IT,
IS IT A LOT HARDER THAN WHAT
YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE ?
 IT'S A WHOLE LOT HARDER
 THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.
  IT LIKE GOING BACK
  TO MAY 5TH
  AND RELIVING
  IT ALL OVER AGAIN.
   ( defense )
   INSPECTOR, LET'S
   TALK ABOUT THE THINGS
  THAT JESSIE TOLD YOU THAT
  ARE JUST ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT,
   ON PAGE 9
   OF HIS STATEMENT,
JESSIE SAYS THAT
 THE MURDERS
 TOOK PLACE AROUND NOON,
HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAS INCORRECT ?
  BECAUSE THE YOUNG BOYS
  WERE STILL IN SCHOOL.
 DID AT ANY TIME WHEN HE WAS
 TELLING YOU THESE THINGS
THAT YOU KNEW
WERE INCORRECT,
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT WHAT HE WAS TELLIN' YOU
   WAS FALSE ?
   HIS ENTIRE STORY
   WAS FALSE ?
IN JESSIE'S CASE,
I FEEL HE DID TELL US
A GOOD BIT OF THE TRUTH
BUT THEN THEY ALSO LESSENED
THEIR ACTIVITY IN A STATEMENT,
THAT'S JUST COMMON,
AT LEAST IN MY
20 YEARS CAREER.
 IS IT COMMON FOR THE POLICE
 TO SIMPLY IGNORE
  THESE BIG OBVIOUS PROBLEMS
  AND JUST ASSUME,
THAT EVERYTHING HE'S TELLING YOU
HAS GOTTA BE CORRECT ?
JESSIE SIMPLY
GOT CONFUSED.
   ( defense )
   YOU AND I
   CAN TELL THE COPS
THAT WE KNOW
WHAT OUR RIGHTS ARE,
   BASICALLY GO TO HELL,
 WE'RE NOT GONNA
 TAKE THIS AND WALK OUT.
  JESSIE MISSKELLEY
  HAS NO CONCEPT
 OF BEING ABLE TO
 LEAVE A POLICE STATION,
THE ONLY THING
THAT THE PROSECUTION
  HAS PUT ON
  AGAINST JESSIE
IS THIS WILD STORY
THAT HE TOLD THE POLICE,
AND I HOPE THE FACT THAT
THERE'S NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
  LINKING HIM
  TO THE CRIME SCENE
  IS GONNA HAVE A LOT
  OF IMPACT ON THE JURY,
 WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT
 REASONABLE DOUBT.
I THINK YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH
LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE,
NOT JUST TO LET THEM
GET AWAY WITH THE FACT
THAT THEY WERE IN THE WATER
AND IT ALL WASHED AWAY.
A CRIME SCENE THAT CLEAN
HAS TO BE PURPOSELY PLANNED,
DONE THAT WAY.
THE FACT THEY
LOOKED WASHED DOWN
WAS NOT JUST
HAPPENSTANCE...
SOMEBODY INTENTIONALLY...
PURPOSEFULLY...
WITH GREAT CUNNING
AND INTELLIGENCE
TRIED TO GET RID OF...
EVERY SPOT OF BLOOD, SEMEN,
MUD, FOOTPRINT,
ANYTHING THAT
MAY HAVE BEEN THERE,
THEY PURPOSEFULLY
TRIED TO GET RID OF ALL THAT.
AN 18, 17,
AND A 16-YR-OLD KID,
DON'T PULL THAT OFF.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF
PROFESSIONAL KILLERS
  WHO DON'T LEAVE IT
  THIS CLEAN.
( Wilkins )
I REALLY DO BELIEVE
THAT IF THE JURY
HEARS WHAT
SERIAL KILLERS ARE LIKE,
AND WHAT THEY DO
AND HOW THEY LEAVE CRIME SCENES,
THE MISSING EVIDENCE,
THE SOUVENIRS,
I HAVE KNOW DOUBT THERE'S
A SERIAL KILLER GOING AROUND,
THAT DID THESE MURDERS,
HE MAY BE IN IDAHO NOW,
BUT, I DON'T HAVE
ANY DOUBT ABOUT IT.
IT IS SOMEBODY WHO KNEW
WHAT THEY WERE DOING,
HAD DONE IT BEFORE,
HAS PROBABLY DONE IT SINCE THEN,
OR WILL DEFINITELY
DO IT AGAIN.
  ( defense )
  ARE YOU AWARE OF
  ANY PERSONALTY TRAITS
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY
TO FALSELY CONFESS ?
LOW I.Q.
HIGHLY SUGGESTIBLE,
ALWAYS ATTEMPTING
TO SOLVE
THE IMMEDIATE
STRESS FACTOR...
GET THE INTERROGATORS
OFF MY BACK
AND JUST
LET ME GO HOME...
NAIVELY ASSUMES
THAT THEY CAN ALL
STRAIGHTEN IT OUT LATER ON.
IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
FOR THE AVERAGE PERSON
TO BELIEVE...
THAT SOMEONE WOULD CONFESS
TO A CRIME THEY DIDN'T DO,
WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE
ABOUT THIS CONFESSION
IS THAT MOST OF IT EMANATED
FROM QUESTIONS RIGHT OFF THE BAT
WITHOUT ANY NARRATIVE
OF ANY LENGTH AT ALL.
WITHOUT ANY DESCRIPTIONS
ABOUT FEELINGS,
OR CONVERSATIONS
OR ANYTHING,
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND,
IF HE WAS INVOLVED
IN THIS CRIME
HOW HE MADE A MISTAKE
ON THE TIME FACTOR.
AND THE THING THAT REALLY
BOTHERS ME IS THE LIGATURE,
WHAT WAS USED
TO TIE UP THE VICTIMS,
HE CERTAINLY KNOWS
THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN SHOE LACES
AND A ROPE,
THAT SHOULD'VE BEEN A SIGNAL
THAT SOMETHING
WAS RADICALLY WRONG.
THAT'S WHEN THE QUESTIONS
SHOULD'VE BEEN MORE PROBING
TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT
HE WAS MAKING IT UP
OR GIVING
A VALID CONFESSION.
   ( prosecutor )
   OUT OF THE 100 OR MORE PEOPLE
THAT Y'ALL TALKED TO,
  ARE YOU AWARE OF ANYBODY
  OTHER THEN THAN THE DEFENDANT,
  WHO TOLD YOU
  ONE OF THE VICTIMS
THAT HAD THEIR
GENITALS REMOVED
AND ONE OF THEM HAD CUTS
TO THE SIDE OF THE FACE,
 AND THERE'D BEEN
 SOME GRABBING OF THE EARS ?
 THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
 THAT MENTIONED
 THOSE PARTICULAR INJURIES,
AND, YOU YOURSELF,
   YOU'RE POINTING TO THE
   WRONG SIDE OF THE CHEEK.
( prosecutor )
WAS THERE ANY KIND
OF EMOTIONAL RESPONSE ?
   ( man )
   HE HAD TEARS
   COMING DOWN HIS EYES.
 HAD Y'ALL YELLED AT HIM
 OR BEEN MEAN TO HIM,
   OR THREATENED HIM,
   OR PROMISED HIM ANYTHING,
   OR ANY
   OF THOSE THINGS ?
NONE OF THOSE THINGS
HAPPENED WHATSOEVER.
   ( defense )
   DOCTOR, CAN YOU
   GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES
   OF THE POLICE BEING COERCIVE,
   LEADING OR SUGGESTIVE
  DURING THE COURSE
  OF THE INTERROGATION ?
YES, I CAN,
PERHAPS THE MOST
POWERFUL EXAMPLE,
IN MY OPINION,
IS THE EXAMPLE
OF THE EIGHT REVISITING
OF THE QUESTION OF THE TIME
AT WHICH
THE KILLINGS OCCURRED.
THE FIRST EXAMPLE
OCCURS ON PAGE THREE,
DET. RIDGE SAYS, "ALRIGHT,
WHEN DID YOU GO WITH THEM ?"
MR. MISSKELLEY SAYS,
"THAT MORNING",
DET. RIDGE ASKS, "I'M NOT
SAYING WHEN THEY CALLED YOU,
"I'M SAYING
WHAT TIME WAS IT
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY
THERE IN THE PARK ?"
MR. MISSKELLEY SAYS,
"ABOUT NOON."
DET. RIDGE NOW SAYS,
"OKAY, WAS IT
AFTER SCHOOL
HAD LET OUT ?"
THIS IS IMMEDIATELY
AFTER JESSIE SAYING
"IT'S AT NOON",
HE'S NOW SUGGESTING
IT MUST BE LATER
BY SAYING, "IS IT
AFTER SCHOOL LET OUT ?"
JESSIE SAYS, "YES".
DET. RIDGE FOLLOWS UP
WITH HIS VICTORY,
ON PAGE 24,
AND THIS TIME
DET. RIDGE SAYS,
AND I QUOTE,
"OKAY, THE NIGHT
"YOU WERE IN THE WOODS,
"HAD YOU ALL
BEEN IN THE WATER ?"
JESSIE REPLIES,
"YEAH, WE'D BEEN
IN THE WATER,
"WE WERE IN IT
THAT NIGHT
PLAYING AROUND IN IT."
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN THE RECORD,
THAT IT IS DIRECTLY
SUGGESTED TO JESSIE,
THAT THE CORRECT ANSWER IS
"THIS HAPPENED AT NIGHT",
IMMEDIATELY UPON
THAT BEING SUGGESTED,
JESSIE...
RESPONDS BY ACCEPTING
AND YOU HE STARTS
TO USE THE WORD "AT NIGHT",
WHERE HE HAD NEVER
USED IT BEFORE,
THAT IS AN INFLUENCE TACTIC,
IT IS A WAY,
OF GETTING SOMEONE
TO ACCEPT SOMETHING,
OUT OF PRESSURE
AND OUT OF SUGGESTION.
BUT, THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE,
THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES
OF MANIPULATION
ON IMPORTANT POINTS
THROUGHOUT THIS RECORD.
  ( prosecutor )
  MR. OFSHE,
IS YOUR GOING RATE
APPROXIMATELY $300 AN HOUR ?
  NO, THAT'S NOT.
WHAT IS IT ?
 MY RATE IS A $150 AN HOUR
 FOR CONSULTATION,
 AND $300 AN HOUR FOR TIME
 SPENDING IN COURT
 OR IN DEPOSITION.
( prosecutor )
SO IF YOU'RE INITIALLY ASKED
TO EVALUATE A CASE,
YOU DON'T GET
THE $300 AN HOUR
  UNLESS YOU GIVE AN OPINION
  THAT'S CONSITENT,
  WITH WHAT THE PERSON ASKED YOU
  WANTS TO HEAR.
   THEY DON'T
  CALL YOU AS A WITNESS,
 YOU DON'T GET YOUR
 $300 AN HOUR, CORRECT ?
INCORRECT.
   I DON'T KNOW WHAT
 THE TERMINOLOGY IS
 IN BERKELEY CALIFORNIA,
 BUT...
   WHEN THE
   DEFENDANT IDENTIFIED
  WHO IT WAS
  WHO WAS CASTRATED,
   WHEN HE INDICATED
   THAT ONE OF THE BOYS
   WAS CUT IN THE FACE,
  YOU DON'T KNOW AND
  YOU CAN'T GIVE AN OPINION
 THAT ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS
 WERE COERCIVE IN NATURE ?
NO, I CAN'T BECAUSE THE RECORD
THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH
IS VERY INCOMPLETE,
BECAUSE THIS
PART OF THE RECORD
IS PRECEDED,
AS EVERYONE AGREES...
BY OVER TWO HOURS
OF INTERROGATION,
IN WHICH MANY SUBJECTS
WERE DISCUSSED,
FOR WHICH
WE HAVE NO RECORD.

JESSIE MISSKELLEY,
DIDN'T TELL
THE POLICE<i> ANYTHING</i>
THAT THEY
DIDN'T ALREADY KNOW.
THEY LED HIM HIM THROUGH
THIS ENTIRE TAPED STATEMENT.
AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
BEFORE THEY TURNED
THE TAPE RECORDER ON.
THEY DIDN'T
VIDEOTAPE IT,
THE OFFICERS DIDN'T TAKE NOTES
ON ALL THE QUESTIONS,
THEY TESTIFIED TO THAT.
THEY EVEN TESTIFIED
THAT THEY COULDN'T REMEMBER
SOME OF THE THINGS
THEY ASKED HIM.
HOW DO WE KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ?
THE DEFENSE,
THROUGH BRINGING IN,
SO-CALLED EXPERTS,
SUCH AS MR. OFSHE,
HAVE TRIED
THROUGH SMOKE AND MIRRORS
TO MAKE IT SOUND LIKE,
A PERSON THAT CONFESSES
TO SUCH A HEINOUS CRIME,
AND ADMITS
THEIR INVOLVEMENT
AND GIVES YOU SPECIFIC DETAILS
IN THE INVOLVEMENT,
THAT'S INDICATIVE
OF SOMEONE,
WHO WAS FORCED
OR COERCED TO CONFESS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,
MY CLIENT,
LITTLE JESSIE MISSKELLEY,
IS AN
INNOCENT MAN.
HE'S INNOCENT.
AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO
GO BACK TO THAT JURY ROOM,
AND BRING BACK A VERDICT
THAT RINGS OF JUSTICE,
TRUTH AND JUSTICE,
AND I WOULD ASK YOU
TO BRING BACK A VERDICT
THAT YOU CAN LIVE WITH
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
( prosecutor )
SEE THIS PICTURE ?
THIS IS THE MOORE BOY.
THIS DEFENDANT WON'T LOOK UP,
HE WON'T LOOK AT YOU,
BUT THIS
DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS,
YOU JUST
THINK ABOUT IT,
IF THIS DEFENDANT
DOES NOT CHASE DOWN
MICHAEL MOORE...
IF HE DOES NOT RUN THROUGH
THE WOODS AND CHASE HIM DOWN
AND BRING HIM BACK,
MICHAEL MOORE LIVES.
MICHAEL MOORE
GETS TO GO HOME AT NIGHT,
HIS PARENTS
GET TO BE WITH HIM.
BUT, BECAUSE OF
THIS DEFENDANT'S ACTIONS...
BECAUSE OF WHAT
JESSIE MISSKELLEY JR. DID,
MICHAEL MOORE'S DEAD,
STEVIE BRANCH IS DEAD,
AND CHRIS BYERS IS DEAD,
AND THERE'S NO
GETTING AROUND IT.
I THINK WHEN YOU GO BACK AND
YOU APPLY YOUR COMMON SENSE
AND YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT,
AND YOU THINK ABOUT
THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE,
YOU'RE GONNA KNOW
THAT WHAT
THE EVIDENCE SHOWS IS,
THAT THIS DEFENDANT
RAN DOWN MICHAEL MOORE,
THAT THIS DEFENDANT WAS THERE,
HE WAS INVOLVED,
AND HE'S GUILTY
OF THREE COUNTS
OF CAPITAL MURDER.
3-2-1.
THE JURY WENT OUT
AT 4:20 THIS AFTERNOON,
THEY'LL DECIDE IF
JESSIE MISSKELLEY IS GUILTY
IN THE DEATHS OF
CHRISTOPHER BYERS,
MICHAEL MOORE
AND STEVEN BRANCH.
MISSKELLEY IS CHARGED
WITH CAPITAL MURDER,
AND, IF GUILTY,
COULD GET THE DEATH PENALTY.
TWO OTHER TEEN-AGERS
CHARGED IN THE CRIME,
WILL BE TRIED LATER THIS MONTH
IN JONESBORO.
IN CORNING,
WAYNE HOFFMAN,
<i> A.R.N. NEWS.</i>
SHORT BUT SWEET.
( woman )
CAN'T YOU
TWITCH YOUR NOSE
  AND MAKE THEM COME BACK
  WITH A "NOT GUILTY" VERCDICT ?
IF I COULD TWITCH MY NOSE
AND DO THAT,
  I'D HAVE BEEN GONE
  A LONG TIME AGO.
( woman )
THERE'S STILL HOPE.
( Jessie )
I'M NOT GIVING UP,
THOUGH.
DON'T EVER !
DON'T GET IN THERE
AND GET MAD AND GO OFF...
   THEY TELL ME, "HOW COME HE
   ALWAYS KEEPS HIS HEAD DOWN ?"
   BECAUSE I WAS<i> TOLD</i>
   TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN.
  IF YOU'D RAISE UP
  AND LOOK AROUND
  THEN, THEY'D BE
  SAYING SOMETHING ELSE.
( woman )
DON'T LET
IT BOTHER YOU.
( Jessie Sr. )
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE
SAYING ABOUT DAMIEN,
ALWAYS STRETCHIN' HIS NECK,
LOOKIN' AROUND.
DAMIEN'S A GOOD KID.
I GUESS,
I DON'T KNOW !
( woman )
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH
I LOVED HIM UNTIL THIS.
I ALWAYS LOVED HIM,
BUT THIS IS JUST--
WELL, THANKS A LOT !
YOU KNOW
I ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
I'M JUST SAYIN'
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW MUCH !
 ( woman )
 YOU'RE COMING HOME.
( man )
YOU GOTTA
GET OUT OF HERE.
JUST SAY A PRAYER
WHEN THE JURY COMES OUT.
   'CAUSE WE'LL
   BE SITTING THERE
 SAYIN' ONE
FOR YOU.
 WE HOPE WE CAN
 CARRY YOU HOME.
IT'S KIND
OF HORRIBLE.
  YOU GOTTA
  LEARN TO CONTROL IT.
   ( judge )
   ALRIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
   IN THE AUDIENCE,
  I AM ACUTELY AWARE THAT...
   YOU'RE...
   FEELINGS ARE ALL ON EDGE,
   THAT THERE'S A GREAT DEAL
   OF EMOTION INVOLVED,
 BUT THE COURT
 CANNOT TOLERATE
  AND<i> WILL</i> NOT TOLERATE,
   ANY VERBAL OUTBURSTS,
 ANY DISPLAY OF
 EMOTION WHATSOEVER,
   AND I RECOGNIZE THAT
   THAT'S DIFFICULT
 AND THAT'S WHY
 I'M WARNING YOU IN ADVANCE.
THE VERDICTS
READ AS FOLLOWS,
 "WE THE JURY FIND
 JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY JR.
 "GUILTY OF
 FIRST DEGREE MURDER
   "IN THE DEATH
   OF MICHAEL MOORE,
  "WE THE JURY FIND
  JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLY JR.
"GUILTY OF
SECOND DEGREE MURDER
   "IN THE DEATH
   OF STEVIE BRANCH,
 "WE THE JURY FIND
 JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY JR.
"GUILTY OF
SECOND DEGREE MURDER
 "IN THE DEATH
 OF CHRIS BYERS,
SIGNED BY
T.J. WILLIAMS, FOREMAN."
ALRIGHT, MR. MISSKELLEY,
   IF YOU COULD COME
   AROUND THE FRONT HERE
AND DAN,
MR. MISSKELLEY, DID YOU HEAR
THE JURY'S FINDING
  AND THE READING OF
  THE VERDICT IN YOUR CASE ?
YES, SIR.
   DO YOU HAVE ANY
   LEGAL REASON OR CAUSE
   TO TELL THE COURT
   WHY SENTENCE
  SHOULD NOT BE
  IMPOSED AT THIS TIME ?
 I HEARD YOU BUT
  YOU NEED TO ANSWER OUT
  A LITTLE BIT LOUDER.
  NO, SIR.
ALRIGHT,
   IS THERE ANYTHING
   YOU WANNA SAY
 BEFORE SENTENCE
 IS IMPOSED ?
 YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO
 MAKE ANY STATEMENT
   YOU CARE TO
   AT THIS TIME.
 ARE YOU SATISFIED
 WITH THE SERVICE AND ADVICE
OF YOUR ATTORNEYS
THROUGH THIS TRIAL ?
 YES, SIR.
 ALRIGHT, BASED UPON
 THE JURY'S VERDICT,
 FINDING YOU GUILTY
 OF FIRST DEGREE MURDER
   IN THE DEATH
   OF MICHAEL MOORE,
   YOU'LL BE SENTENCED TO THE
   ARKANSAS DEPT. OF CORRECTIONS
 FOR A TERM OF LIFE,
 IN THE COUNT INVOLVING
 THE DEATH OF STEVEN BRANCH,
THE JURY HAVING FOUND YOU GUILTY
OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER,
YOU'LL BE SENTENCED TO AN
ADDITIONAL TERM OF 20 YEARS,
AND IN REGARD TO
   THE DEATH
   OF CHRISTOPHER BYERS,
THE JURY HAVING FOUND YOU GUILTY
OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER,
  YOU WILL BE SENTENCED TO
  AN ADDITIONAL TERM OF 20 YEARS
   IN THE ARKANSAS DEPT.
   OF CORRECTIONS,
  THAT IS YOU WILL RECEIVE
  A LIFE SENTENCE PLUS 40 YEARS.
IT'S HARD
TO THINK OF HOW
IT WOULD'VE GONE
ANY OTHER WAY,
BUT YOU CAN NEVER
TELL WITH A JURY OF 12,
THEY COULD'VE FOUND
A VERDICT OF NOT GUILTY,
AND WE HAD TO SIT THERE
AND TELL OURSELVES,
"GOD GRANT US THE SERENITY
"TO ACCEPT THE THINGS
WE CANNOT CHANGE
"THE COURAGE TO
CHANGE THE THINGS WE CAN
AND THE WISDOM
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE."
SO WE HAD TO BE WILLING
TO ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED,
AND THANKFULLY
THE VERDICT WENT OUR WAY.
  ( reporter )
  THERE MUST BE
  MIXED EMOTIONS
 BECAUSE YOU HAD
 THE GUILTY VERDICT
  BUT YOU STILL HAVE
  THE LOSS TO DEAL WITH.
 THIS DOESN'T
 CHANGE ANYTHING.
 CHRISTOPHER'S DEAD,
 AND HE WAS
 TORTURED TO DEATH
 BY THREE MURDERING BASTARDS
 ON A DITCH BANK,
 HE WAS 8 YEARS OLD.
 AND GUILTY IS GUILTY.
 AND I HOPE THE LITTLE SUCKER,
 WHEN HE HITS PRISON,
 THEY GET HIS ASS
 RIGHT OFF THE BAT !
 BECAUSE HE
 DESERVES TO BE
 TORTURED AND PUNISHED
 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
 FOR MURDERING THREE
 8 YEAR OLD CHILDREN !
( reporter )
HOW COME YOU KEPT YOUR
HEAD DOWN THE WHOLE TIME ?
 ( reporter )
 JESSIE, ANYTHING
 YOU WANNA SAY NOW ?
( reporter )
DID YOU DO IT,
JESSIE ?
( reporter )
DID YOU DO IT, JESSIE ?
 ( reporter )
 HOW ARE YOU
 FEELING RIGHT NOW ?
 ( car starts )
   PRISON'S NOT
   A SAFE PLACE.
JESSIE, SWEETIE.
   I'M GONNA
   MAIL HIM A SKIRT.
 ( Mark )
 ONE DOWN TWO TO GO.
HOPEFULLY THE SAME THING
WILL HAPPEN TO THE NEXT TWO,
   AND WE'LL GET
   THE SAME VERDICT.
THEY FOUND
MY SON'S TESTICLES
IN A JAR OF ALCOHOL
IN DAMIEN ECHOL'S HOUSE,
WITH HIS FINGERPRINTS
ON THE JAR.
NOW, HOW DO YOU
DISPUTE THAT ?
SOME IDIOT STARTED
A RUMOR SAYING THAT
THEY FOUND UMM...
CHILDREN'S SEXUAL PARTS
UNDER MY BED
OR IN MY HOUSE.
AND THERE WAS NO
BODY PARTS IN MY HOUSE.
I THINK MAYBE THE POLICE
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT.
IF THEY CAN MAKE US LOOK BAD
IN FRONT OF THE PUBLIC,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA KINDA
HAVE THEIR MINDS MADE UP,
BEFORE ANYTHING
EVER COMES OUT.
WE WANNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT
ALL THIS STUFF IN THE PAPER
ABOUT A DEAL
WITH JESSIE.
RIGHT NOW WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS SITUATION IS,
ALTHOUGH WE THINK HE IS MORE
INCLINED TO TESTIFY RIGHT NOW
THAN HE HAS BEEN
AT ANY POINT,
UP TO NOW.
THE FRIDAY THAT
JESSIE WAS CONVICTED,
BY QUESTIONING, THE OFFICERS
THAT TOOK HIM DOWN
INQUIRED OF HIM
WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED,
APPARENTLY, JESSIE, CONTRARY
TO SOMEBODY THAT WAS INNOCENT,
THAT WOULD SAY THINGS LIKE,
"GEE, I'VE JUST BEEN CONVICTED,
I DIDN'T DO IT,
WHAT A TERRIBLE INJUSTICE",
JESSIE TALKED
ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE
ABOUT HOW
HE COMMITTED THE CRIME,
AND SPECIFIC DETAILS,
UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED
HIS TESTIMONY REAL BAD.
IF IT WAS
A PERFECT WORLD,
WE WOULD TAKE WHAT WE
HAVE ON JESSIE AND LEAVE IT,
AND WE'D GO AND
GET THE OTHER TWO,
AND GET THEM
AND BE HAPPY,
BUT IT'S NOT,
AND, WE NEED HIS TESTIMONY
TO BE SURE WE GET
CONVICTIONS ON THE OTHER TWO.
I THINK WE'RE GONNA
NEGOTIATE HIS
SENTENCE DOWN SOME
IN ORDER TO
GET HIM TO TESTIFY.
HE'S NOT GONNA
TESTIFY JUST
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF HIS HEART,
THE ONLY WAY THAT
I THINK
THAT HE WILL
BE WILLING TO TESTIFY,
IS IF THE LIFE SENTENCE
IS REMOVED.
I DO WANNA SAY,
ALL IS NOT LOST,
IF HE DOESN'T TESTIFY,
BUT THE ODDS ARE
REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY.
WE STILL GOT
SOME EVIDENCE.
WHAT WE'VE GOT,
BESIDES JESSIE,
WE GOT...
A FIBER THAT WAS FOUND ON,
IT WAS FOUND
ON STEVIE'S SHIRT,
THAT MATCHED THE FIBER
FROM JASON BALDWIN'S MOTHER,
WHICH IS CALLED
SECONDARY TRANSFER.
WE'VE GOT
A FIBER FROM A SHIRT,
OR A COUPLE OF FIBERS
FROM A SHIRT
FOUND AT ECHOL'S HOUSE,
FOUND...
ONE OF 'EM WAS ON
MICHAEL'S CUB SCOUT CAP,
ANOTHER ONE
MAYBE ON THE SHIRT,
THAT MATCHED DAMIEN'S.
FIBER EVIDENCE,
IN MY OPINION,
IS BETTER
THAN HAIR EVIDENCE,
BUT THEY CAN'T SAY
THAT IT CAME FROM
THAT PARTICULAR GARMENT
TO EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHERS.
WE'VE GOT
THE HOLLINGSWORTH CLAN
THAT SAYS THEY SAW DAMIEN
OUT ON THE SERVICE ROAD,
WE'VE GOT SOME...
KIDS THAT SAY THAT
THEY HEARD HIM
AT A GIRL'S SOFTBALL GAME,
OVERHEARD HIM SAY
THAT HE KILLED THE THREE BOYS
AND HE WAS GONNA
KILL TWO MORE
BEFORE HE
TURNED HIMSELF IN.
  ( man )
  THEY HAVEN'T SCARED THEM OFF,
  LIKE THEY DID THE OTHER ONES ?
  NO, NOT YET.
  WE'VE GOT...
  A GUY THAT WAS
  IN JAIL WITH JASON
WHO SAYS THAT
JASON MADE SOME
INCRIMINATING
STATEMENTS TO HIM,
NOW, THERE ARE SOME THINGS
THAT THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO DO
TO ATTACK
THIS KID'S CREDIBILITY.
THEN WE'VE GOT THE KNIFE
THAT WAS FOUND
IN THE LAKE
BEHIND JASON'S HOUSE,
SO, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT,
BUT, THAT'S<i> ALL</i>
BASICALLY WE GOT.
YOU ASKED WHAT THE ODDS WERE OF
CONVICTING THEM WITHOUT JESSIE
AND IT'S 50-50,
NOT BE GOOD.
 ( man )
 THE ONLY WAY
 HE'LL COME UP THERE
   AND SIT DOWN
   IN THAT WITNESS CHAIR
AND TESTIFY,
  IS IF THEY CUT HIM
  A SWEET DEAL,
YOU TAKE ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE
WRONG WITH HIS STATEMENT
 AND THEN ADD
 TO THAT RECIPE MIX,
 THAT I'M TALKIN' NOW
 BECAUSE I GOT A SWEET DEAL,
   AND I'M GONNA GET OUT
   IN 10 YEARS,
 HYPOTHETICALLY,
 I MAY GET OUT
 IN 10 YEARS.
   HECK, WHO<i> WOULDN'T</i> SING ?
   YOU KNOW
   WHAT I'M SAYING ?
 THEN, HIS EVIDENCE,
 HIS STATEMENT,
HIS WHOLE THING
LOOKS BAD,
  IF THAT'S THEIR BEST EVIDENCE,
  AND TRUST ME, IT IS,
  IF THEY CAN'T USE
 THAT STATEMENT AGAINST YOU,
   THEY GOT NOTHIN'.
  AND THIS DOG AND PONY SHOW
  IS OVER.
  'MORNING.
( reporter )
ARE THE RUMOR'S FALSE
ABOUT JESSIE TURNING ?
IS IT TRUE THAT
JESSIE'S GONNA TESTIFY
AGAINST DAMIEN
AND JASON ?
   THAT'S FALSE.
  I JUST LEFT JESSIE
  AT THE JAIL
   AND HE TOLD ME THAT
   HE WAS NOT GONNA TESTIFY,
  HE DIDN'T WANT TO
  GET UP THERE AND LIE,
 THAT THE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN
 WORKING ON HIM REAL HARD,
   BUT, HE WASN'T
   GONNA LISTEN TO THEM,
 AND HIS DECISION WAS FINAL,
  BUT HE CAN ALWAYS
  CHANGE HIS MIND AGAIN,
  HE HAS,
HE'S A VERY CONFUSED
AND SCARED KID,
   AND THE OFFICERS
   HAVE SCARED HIM TO DEATH.
LAST NIGHT I SAID, JESSIE,
IF YOU GET UP THERE AND LIE,
I'M GONNA BE
IN THAT COURTROOM,
AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SIT THERE AND TELL THAT LIE,
WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I'M
SITTING THERE LISTENING TO YOU,
WHEN YOU KNOW
I KNOW THAT YOU ARE LYING.
( reporter )
DAMIEN, ARE YOU
IN A CULT ?
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT JESSIE
TESTIFYING AGAINST YOU ?
  ( prosecutor )
  IN LOOKING AT YOUNG PEOPLE
 INVOLVED IN THE OCCULT,
  DO YOU SEE ANY
  PARTICULAR TYPE OF DRESS ?
I HAVE PERSONALLY OBSERVED
PEOPLE WEARING
BLACK FINGER NAILS,
HAVING THEIR
HAIR PAINTED BLACK,
WEARING BLACK T-SHIRTS...
SOMETIMES THEY WILL
TATOO THEMSELVES.
 ( prosecutor )
 DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION
 AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
 THERE ARE OCCULT OVERTONES,
  OR EVIDENCE OF
  OCCULT INVOLVEMENT
IN THESE
PARTICULAR MURDERS ?
  WELL, THE DATE
  BEING CLOSE TO...
 <i> BELTING...</i>
   A HOLIDAY, MAY 1,
ALSO...
 THE DAY BEFORE
 THAT IS A HOLIDAY,
  THEN YOU GO INTO
   THE FACT THAT SOME
   GROUPS,
   OCCULT, CULT GROUPS,
   WILL USE A FULL MOON.
   IN SEVERAL OCCULT BOOKS,
 THEY WILL TALK ABOUT
 THE LIFE FORCE OF THE BLOOD.
 USUALLY THE YOUNGER
 THE INDIVIDUAL,
 THE MORE PURE IT IS.
 THE MORE POWER
 OR FORCE IT HAS.
 A LOT OF TIMES
 THEY WILL TAKE BLOOD
 AND STORE IT
 FOR OTHER SERVICES,
 AND OTHER USE,
 AS WELL AS CONSUME IT,
 OR BATHE IN IT.
  NOW THE...
 ITEM THAT'S
 DRAWN ON THE FRONT,
  WHAT IS THAT ?
THAT IS A PENTAGRAM,
THAT HAPPENS TO BE
A "WICCAN",
OR WHITE WITCHCRAFT
PENTAGRAM.
   ( prosecutor )
   NOW, IF YOU OPEN THE BOOK
   TO THE FRONT PAGE.
   YES, SIR.
 ( prosecutor )
 NOW...
   EXPLAIN
   WHAT THAT IS.
THAT'S CONFUSION TO ME.
THE REASON WHY IS
WE GOT A WHITE WITCHCRAFT...
"WICCAN" PENTAGRAM,
THEN WE HAVE
UPSIDE-DOWN CROSSES,
WHICH COMES FROM ANOTHER
TYPE OF A OCCULTISM.
 WHAT TYPE ?
THAT'S<i> BLACK</i> WITCHCRAFT.
( prosecutor )
IS IT "WICCA", SATANISM,
  OR BOTH ?
BOTH.
  AND DID YOU NOTICE
  ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR
ABOUT THE BOOK ?
THERE'S A CHAPTER IN HERE CALLED
"RISE OF THE DEVIL"
 AND...
IT IS UNDERLINED IN RED.
AND THERE ARE A COUPLE
OF SENTENCES IN THERE,
REFERENCE TO
BLOOD,
AND IT'S LIFE FORCE.
   HOW WERE YOU ACCEPTED
   INTO ENROLLMENT
 AT COLUMBIA PACIFIC
 UNIVERSITY ?
   I HAD TO FILL OUT
   SEVERAL SERIES OF PAPERS
   INCLUDING
   ALL MY EDUCATION,
 BACKGROUND, EXPERIENCE.
  DID YOU EVER FILL OUT
  A LITTLE FLYER LIKE THIS ?
NO, SIR.
IT SAYS, "CALL TOLL-FREE
FOR INFORMATION
ON HOW TO BECOME A DOCTOR ?"
THIS IS A MAIL ORDER COLLEGE,
ISN'T IT ?
   ( defense )
   WHAT CLASSES DID YOU TAKE
   BETWEEN 1980 AND 1982
  TO OBTAIN
  YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE ?
 WHAT CLASSES ?
  I TESTIFIED--
 I'M ASKING YOU,
  WHAT CLASSES
  DID YOU TAKE ?
I ANSWERED THAT
BEFORE, NONE.
   YOU DID NOT
   TAKE ANY CLASSES,
   BETWEEN 1982 AND 1984
 WHEN YOU BECAME A PH.D.
  WHAT CLASSES
  DID YOU TAKE ?
 NONE.
  NONE, O.K.
 IS IT YOUR OPINION,
   AND DO YOU WANT
   TO TELL THIS JURY...
  THAT THESE CRIMES,
 WERE MOTIVATED
 BY OCCULT BELIEFS ?
YES.
( man )
WE'RE NOT TRASH,
BY NO MEANS,
BY SON WAS BORN
IN WEST MEMPHIS,
HE WAS RAISED
IN WEST MEMPHIS,
AND FOR THE LIFE OF ME,
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHY PEOPLE HAVE GOT
THIS BAD IMAGINE OF HIM.
SO WHAT IF HE WORE
A BLACK TRENCH COAT ?
HE'S NOT THE
ONLY ONE THAT DOES.
SO WHAT IF HE
WORE BLACK T-SHIRTS,
BLACK PANTS ?
JOHNNY CASH WEARS BLACK,
DOESN'T HE ?
   I WEAR BLACK,
   MICHELLE WEARS BLACK,
DOMINI WEARS BLACK !
  WE'RE ALL JUST
  PARTIAL TO BLACK, I GUESS.
I LIKE BLACK MYSELF.
AND, I'M BY NO MEANS
NO DEVIL WORSHIPER,
NOR IS HE.
HE WAS GOIN' TO SCHOOL,
HE WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL
TO BE A PRIEST,
HE WAS FAITHFUL
IN THE CHURCH.
HE LOOKED INTO
A LITTLE BIT OF "WICCA",
BUT, HE NEVER
WENT TO IT,
AND I THINK IF PEOPLE
LOOKED INTO WHAT "WICCA" IS
THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND IT
A LITTLE BETTER.
THE ONLY THING WICCANS DO,
IS WORSHIP THE EARTH.
( Damien )
PEOPLE PROBABLY THINK
THAT I'M INTO SATANISM
BECAUSE USUALLY WHAT
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND
THEY TRY TO DESTROY...
OR RIDICULE.
TRY TO MAKE IT
LOOK BAD OR WRONG.
WEST MEMPHIS IS
PRETTY MUCH LIKE
SECOND SALEM.
BECAUSE EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS HERE,
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS,
IT'S BLAMED ON SATANISM.
( judge )
HE'S BEEN
PREVIOUSLY SWORN.
CORRECT.
  ( defense )
  PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME
  FOR THE COURT.
   DAMIEN WAYNE ECHOLS.
  WHY DID YOU
  CHANGE YOUR NAME ?
I WAS VERY INVOLVED
IN THE CATHOLIC CHURCH,
AND WE WERE GOING OVER
DIFFERENT NAMES OF THE SAINTS,
ST. MICHAELS WAS
WHERE I WENT TO CHURCH,
AND WE HEARD
ABOUT THIS GUY
FROM THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS,
FATHER DAMIEN,
THAT TOOK CARE OF LEPERS,
UNTIL HE FINALLY CAUGHT
THE DISEASE HIMSELF AND DIED.
  ( defense )
  WAS THAT THE REASON YOU CHOOSE
  DAMIEN AS YOUR FIRST NAME ?
YES, IT IS.
DID THE CHOOSING
OF THE NAME "DAMIEN"
 HAVE ANYTHING
 TO DO WITH ANY TYPE OF
HORROR MOVIES, SATANISM,
CULTISM,
ANY OF THAT NATURE ?
NOTHING
WHATSOEVER.
   AFTER THE TIME PERIOD
   THAT YOU WERE REALLY
  INTO THE
  CATHOLIC RELIGION,
 DID YOU START FOCUSING
ON ANOTHER PARTICULAR RELIGION ?
  "WICCA".
 COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO THE LADIES
 AND GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY
   SOME PRINCIPALS ABOUT
   THE WICCA RELIGION ?
IT ACKNOWLEDGES A GODDESS
IN A HIGHER REGARD
AS A GOD,
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS SAID
WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN,
AND MEN CANNOT
HAVE CHILDREN.
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE
A CLOSE INVOLVEMENT
WITH NATURE.
   IS THERE
   A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
  THE WICCA RELIGION
   AND WITCHCRAFT ?
( Damien )
WICCA IS ALSO
CALLED "WITCHCRAFT",
THE WORD "WICCA"
WAS BASTARDIZED,
IT ORIGINALLY
MEANT "WISE ONE".
 DID THE FACT THAT YOU LIKE
 TO WEAR BLACK ALL THE TIME,
 WERE YOU DIFFERENT
 IN OTHER WAYS AS WELL ?
YES, I'VE NEVER HAD
A LOT OF THE SAME INTERESTS
THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE,
LIKE SPORTS,
THINGS LIKE THAT,
I'VE NEVER BEEN
INTO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
 DID IT HELP YOU
 DEAL WITH OTHER PEOPLE
TO HAVE PEOPLE
KIND OF STAND-OFFISH
AND SORT OF
BACK AWAY FROM YOU ?
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE
A DEFENSE MECHANISM,
IT WOULD MAKE
PEOPLE THINK LIKE,
WELL HE'S WEIRD
I'M NOT GONNA GO AROUND HIM,
SO, IT KEPT PEOPLE AWAY.
 THE STATE
 INTRODUCED THE BOOK
"NEVER ON A BROOMSTICK",
  ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
  THAT PARTICULAR BOOK ?
  YES, I AM.
 WHERE DID YOU
 GET THAT BOOK, DAMIEN ?
AT THE LIBRARY,
ALL THE BOOKS THAT THEY WERE
GETTIN' TIRED OF
OR HAD FOR A LONG TIME,
THEY HAD THEM
SITTIN' ON A RACK OUT FRONT,
THAT THEY WERE SELLING
FOR 10 CENTS EACH,
SO I GOT IT.
   DID YOU UNDERLINE ANY OF
   THOSE PORTIONS IN THE BOOK ?
THAT WAS DONE
WHEN I GOT IT,
I THINK IT WAS BECAUSE SOMEBODY
HAD A REPORT TO DO,
'CAUSE ALL DURING THE BOOK
THERE'S LITTLE NOTES,
CERTAIN DATES AND STUFF,
LIKE FROM THE 1600'S
IN THE OUTSIDE MARGIN.
   SO WAS THAT BOOK KIND OF LIKE
   A HISTORY OF WITCHCRAFT
  AND HOW IT'S DEVELOPED
  OVER THE AGES ?
   YES.
 ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH
 THE CONTENTS OF THAT NOTEBOOK ?
YES, I AM.
 I NOTICED ON THE INSIDE
 OF THE FRONT COVER
   THERE APPEARS TO BE
   A COUPLE OF QUOTES THERE,
  COULD YOU READ
  EACH OF THOSE TO THE JURY
  AND TELL THEM
  WHERE THAT CAME FROM ?
"LIFE IS BUT
A WALKING SHADOW,
"IT IS A TALE
TOLD BY AN IDIOT,
FULL OF SOUND AND FURY
SIGNIFYING NOTHING."
THAT'S FROM A
"MIDSUMMER'S NIGHT'S DREAM",
BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
"PURE BLACK
LOOKING CLEAR,
"MY WORK IS
SOON DONE HERE,
TRY GETTING BACK FROM ME,
THAT WHICH USED TO BE."
THAT IS OFF
A<i> METALLICA</i> TAPE,
CALLED "AND JUSTICE FOR ALL",
TALKS ABOUT HOW WARPED
THE COURT SYSTEMS ARE,
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
   ON MAY THE 5TH...
 DID YOU KILL
 MICHAEL MOORE ?
 NO, I DID NOT.
ON MAY THE 5TH,
DID YOU KILL
STEVIE BRANCH ?
   NO, I DID NOT.
ON MAY THE 5TH,
DID YOU KILL
CHRIS BYERS ?
   NO, I DID NOT.
HAVE YOU EVER PARTICIPATED
IN ANY TYPE OF HUMAN SACRIFICE ?
NO, I HAVE NOT.
19 YEAR OLD
DAMIEN ECHOLS
ADMITS HE
STANDS OUT IN A CROWD.
HE SAYS HE LOVES
HEAVY METAL MUSIC--
3-2-1...
19 YEAR OLD
DAMIEN ECHOLS SAYS--
3-2-1...
19 YEAR OLD DAMIEN ECHOLS
ADMITS HE STANDS OUT IN A CROWD.
HE SAYS HE LIKES TO
WEAR BLACK MOST OF THE TIME,
PRACTICES
THE "WICCA" RELIGION,
AND LOVES
HEAVY METAL MUSIC,
BUT HE SAYS HE'S
DEFINITELY NOT A KILLER.
( woman )
I BELIEVE THEY DID IT,
AND IF THEY WERE TO BE
SET FREE ON THE STREET,
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO
LOOK BEHIND THEIR BACK,
WATCH BEHIND THEIR BACK,
TO SEE IF PAM HOBBS
WOULDN'T FOLLOW 'EM.
BECAUSE I'M JUST
SAYING THIS AS A HUMAN.
I WOULD,
I BELIEVE I'D
TRY TO KILL THEM TWO,
IF THEY EVER
WALKED THE STREET,
AND I'M STILL ALIVE.
I BELIEVE
I'D BE STALKING THEM.
TO DO TO THEM...
PROBABLY SHOOT 'EM,
AND THEN CUT 'EM UP.
( woman )
WHEN I WAS DOWN AT THE COURTROOM
AND DAMIEN WALKED PAST ME,
I WANTED TO GO OVER THERE,
AND TAKE MY HAND
AND JUST
CLAW DOWN HIS FACE,
INFLICT ANY KIND OF PAIN,
THAT I COULD
INFLICT ON HIM.
I KNOW, EVENTUALLY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FORGIVE 'EM,
  I UNDERSTAND THAT,
 BUT WHEN IT HAPPENS
 IN YOUR HOME
 AND YOU WATCH YOUR WIFE
 LOSE HER MIND,
AND WHATEVER
HAPPENED TO HER,
 YOUR HOME IS TORE APART
 AND BUSTED UP,
 I DON'T FEEL IT'S FAIR
 RIGHT NOW,
FOR SOMEONE TO ASK ME TO FORGIVE
THE ONES THAT CAUSED IT.
IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME,
A LONG TIME,
BEFORE I COULD
FORGIVE 'EM.
   ( man )
   YOU SAY THAT IT'S
   GONNA TAKE TIME,
   WE DON'T KNOW
   HOW MUCH TIME WE GOT,
 AND WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
 TO SEE STEVIE AGAIN,
   WE HAVE TO
   FORGIVE IN OUR HEART,
   BECAUSE THE LORD,
 FORGAVE<i> US,</i>
  HE FORGAVE US,
HE SHEDDED HIS BLOOD
FOR<i> US.</i>
HE SHEDDED
HIS BLOOD FOR<i> THEM.</i>
AND HE JUST ASKED US
TO HAVE A...
   FORGIVING SPIRIT.
   NOW, I REFUSE,
 TO SERVE SIN AND SATAN.
   BECAUSE I'M GONNA
   SEE STEVIE AGAIN,
  I'M GONNA BE
  WITH STEVIE AGAIN,
   I'M GONNA BE
   WITH MY MOTHER AGAIN.
   I'M GONNA BE WITH
   YOUR GRANDMOTHER,
   BOTH OF THEM.
   I'M GONNA BE WITH
   ALL OF MY LOVED ONES,
 THAT HAVE PASSED ON
 AND WENT TO HEAVEN.
   ( man )
   IF YOU COULD
   SPEAK TO THE FAMILIES...
   OF THESE KIDS
   WHO THINK YOU DID IT,
 WHAT WOULD YOU
 SAY TO THEM ?
I DON'T KNOW.
( Damien )
JASON WAS MY BEST FRIEND,
WE DID ABOUT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE WE EVEN
LIVED TOGETHER MOST OF THE TIME,
STAYED AT
EACH OTHERS HOUSES,
WORE EACH OTHER'S CLOTHES.
IT WAS MORE LIKE
WE WERE BROTHERS.
WE USED TO GO OUT AND
SNAKE HUNT ALL THE TIME.
SNAKES AND MUSIC
WERE ABOUT OUR
WHOLE LIFE REALLY.
WE WERE ALL THE TIME
LOOKIN' FOR NEW GROUPS,
THAT WE WOULD LIKE.
OUR FAVORITE
KINDS OF MUSIC
 WERE LIKE<i> SLAYER,
 METALLICA, MEGADETH.</i>
  <i> U2... </i>
WOULD WE WOULD DO JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
 ( prosecutor )
 I WANNA DRAW YOUR ATTENTION
  BACK TO AUGUST
  OF LAST YEAR,
  WERE YOU WERE IN THE CRAIGHEAD
  JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITY ?
  YES, I WAS.
  AND WHAT WERE YOU
  IN THERE FOR AT THE TIME ?
  BURGLARY.
AND, WHEN
YOU WERE THERE,
 WAS THERE
 A JASON BALDWIN
  IN THE JUVENILE
  DETENTION FACILITY
  AT THE SAME TIME ?
YES.
  WHILE YOU WERE IN CONTACT
  WITH THIS JASON BALDWIN,
WAS THERE ANYTHING MENTIONED
ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT
 IN THE MURDERS OF THE THREE
 EIGHT YEAR OLDS ?
YES, WE WERE SITTING THERE
PLAYING SPADES
AND I WANTED TO GET TO KNOW
EVERYBODY OFF IN THERE,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'D CALL IT,
BUT, I JUST WANTED
TO GET TO KNOW HIM,
AND I JUST STRAIGHT OUT
ASKED HIM IF HE DID IT
AND HE DENIED IT
THE FIRST TIME.
  DID YOU HAVE AN OCCASION AGAIN
  WHILE YOU WERE THERE
TO ASK HIM
WAS HE INVOLVED
 IN THE MURDERS OF
 THE THREE EIGHT YEAR OLDS ?
 YES.
 I THINK IT WAS
 LIKE THE NEXT DAY.
 I BELIEVE IT WAS
 THE NEXT DAY.
 AND CAN YOU TELL US
 WHAT WAS GOING ON,
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
AT THE TIME THAT OCCURRED ?
ME AND JASON WERE
SCRAPIN' UP THE CARDS,
GOIN' TO OUR CELLS FOR LUNCH,
AND I SAID, "JUST BETWEEN
ME AND YOU, I WON'T SAY A WORD,
DID YOU DO IT ?"
AND HE SAID "YES",
AND HE WENT INTO DETAIL.
  WHAT DID HE TELL YOU ?
HE TOLD ME
HOW HE
DISMEMBERED THE KID,
OR I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY HOW MANY KIDS,
HE JUST SAID
HE DISMEMBERED 'EM,
HE SUCKED THE BLOOD
FROM THE PENIS AND SCROTUM,
AND PUT THE BALLS
IN HIS MOUTH.
  ( prosecutor )
  NOW MICHAEL,
  WHEN WAS IT
  THAT YOU...
 CAME FORWARD
 WITH THIS INFORMATION ?
I'M NOT REALLY SURE,
I BELIEVE IT WAS LIKE
A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER.
 WHAT CAUSED YOU
 TO COME FORWARD
  AT THAT POINT IN TIME,
WHY DID MICHAEL CARSON NO LONGER
WANNA STAY UNINVOLVED,
   WHY DID YOU COME FORWARD
   IN FEBRUARY THIS YEAR ?
   'CAUSE I SAW
   THE FAMILY ON TV,
  I SAW HOW
  BROKEN-HEARTED THEY WERE
  ABOUT THEIR
  CHILDREN BEING MISSING,
  AND I GOT A SOFT HEART,
  I COULDN'T TAKE IT.
( defense )
NOW, HE TELLS YOU THIS
AND THEN YOU'RE<i> SILENT...</i>
FROM AUGUST,
UNTIL FEBRUARY,
IS THAT RIGHT ?
   YES, SIR.
 AND IN THE SECOND CONVERSATION
 YOU'VE EVER HAD
 WITH THIS YOUNG MAN
 IN HIS ENTIRE LIFE
   HE TELLS YOU
   ALL THIS STUFF ?
  YES, SIR.
  AFTER HE'S HAD
 <i> ONE</i> CONVERSATION WITH YOU.
 ( Carter )
 YES, SIR.
( man )
ONE DAY WHEN
I WAS UP HERE WORKIN',
THE PHONE RINGS,
SECRETARY SAYS,
YOU WON'T KNOW WHO HE IS
BUT HE NEEDS TO TALK TO YOU,
I PICK UP THE PHONE,
HE SAYS I'M DANNY WILLIAMS,
I'M EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU
WHAT I NEED TO TELL YOU,
HE SAID BUT I WORK WITH
THE JUVENILE DEPARTMENT HERE,
AND I DO DRUG
AND ALCOHOL COUNSELING,
AND THERE'S A GUY
NAMED MICHAEL CARSON
WHO'S GONNA TESTIFY THAT
JASON CONFESSED
TO HIM IN JAIL
AND I KNOW HE'S LYING.
I SAID,
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT ?
HE SAID, WELL,
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO,
MICHAEL CARSON WAS
ONE OF THE KIDS
THAT I WORKED WITH,
AND...
HE AND I HAD A CONVERSATION
WHERE I TOLD HIM
THAT THIS JASON BALDWIN
HAD BEEN ACCUSED OF
KILLING THREE BOYS
AND SEXUALLY MUTILATING THEM.
AND BASICALLY,
HE GAVE MICHAEL CARSON
THE DETAILS
THAT HE TESTIFIED TO
AT THE TRIAL.
AT THE TIME
CARSON SAYS NOTHING...
AND THEN CARSON
LATER TELLS HIM,
"HEY, BY THE WAY DANNY,
"I'M TELLIN' THE POLICE
THAT JASON
CONFESSED TO ME",
SO HE CALLS ME UP
AND SAYS NO, NO,
THIS KID'S A LIAR,
HE'S NO GOOD,
I KNOW HE'S LYING,
AND THE ONLY REASON
HE'S GOT THIS INFORMATION
IS BECAUSE
I GAVE IT TO HIM.
   THE COUNSELOR OF THIS KID
   CALLED THE PROSECUTION
  AND TOLD 'EM
  WHAT A LIAR HE WAS
AND THE PROSECUTION
STILL USED THE KID,
  AND NOW THEY'RE TRYIN'
  TO KEEP OUT THE FACT
 THE BACKGROUND
 OF THE KID.
OBVIOUSLY WE WANNA
GET THAT INFORMATION OUT
BUT THE JUDGE ACTS LIKE HE
MIGHT NOT LET US USE IT AT ALL.
WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY
BE ABLE TO
LET THAT JURY KNOW
THAT HE IS
<i> LSD</i> DEPENDENT,
BECAUSE IT DOES EFFECT
HIS ABILITY TO RECALL.
THE JUDGE TAKES
ALL THAT AWAY FROM US
AND SAYS, THE KID
LOOKS PRETTY BELIEVABLE.
   NOT ONLY ARE THEY KEEPING OUT
   THE BACKGROUND OF THE KID
  WHEN HE TESTIFIES, SO THE JURY
  DOESN'T HAVE ALL THE EGGS,
  BUT NOW THEY'RE
  KEEPING OUT THE COUNSELOR,
   WHO EVEN
   KNOWS ABOUT THIS KID,
  WHO TOLD HIM THE STORY
  IN THE FIRST PLACE,
PRIOR TO HIM
EVER TELLING THE POLICE.
 ALL THAT GOES
 TO THE CREDIBILITY.
I THINK THAT WOULD'VE SHOWN
THE JURY THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE
QUITE THAT KIND HEART.
THAT SOFT HEART.
   ( prosecutor )
   DET. ALLEN, I WANT TO
   DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION
 TO NOVEMBER
 THE 17TH, 1993,
   WERE YOU ASKED TO
  MAKE CONTACT WITH SOME
PROPERTY OWNERS AT
LAKESHORE TRAILER PARK,
  AND ALSO GET WITH
THE ARKANSAS
STATE POLICE DIVE TEAM ?
( Allen )
YES, SIR I WAS.
  AND AFTER
  A PERIOD OF TIME OF...
SEARCHING,
  DO YOU KNOW WHETHER
  ANY ITEMS WERE RECOVERED ?
  YES, SIR.
MARK FOR
IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES,
 THE STATE'S EXHIBIT 77,
 AND I ASK IF YOU
 CAN IDENTIFY THAT.
YES,
 I CAN IDENTIFY THIS
 BY MY...
 "11-17 OF '93,
 M. ALLEN",
 THAT I PUT HERE.
 ( prosecutor )
 WHERE DID YOU
 GET THE KNIFE ?
( Allen )
I GOT THIS KNIFE FROM
THE DIVER
WITH THE STATE POLICE.
  HOW LONG DID
  THIS SEARCH TAKE ?
"HOW LONG ?"
FROM MEMORY, I'M THINKING,
MAYBE 10:30 A.M.
IS THE TIME THEY GOT SUITED UP
AND STARTED TO LOOK.
  YOU QUIT AT WHEN ?
THEY LOCATED THE...
KNIFE,
AT 11:35 A.M.
11:30, 11:35.
  ABOUT AN HOUR.
ABOUT AN HOUR--
  ARE YOU TELLING THIS JURY
THAT THIS KNIFE
IS THE MURDER WEAPON ?
IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE TELLIN' THIS JURY ?
 NO, SIR, I'M NOT
 TELLING THE JURY THAT.
OKAY, NOW THAT
WE UNDERSTAND THAT.
WHAT DAY WERE THESE
INDIVIDUALS CHARGED ?
  WHAT DID DAY DID
  Y'ALL CHARGE DAMIEN ECHOLS
  WITH THIS CRIME ?
WAS IT JUNE
THE THIRD ?
YES, SIR.
 AND WHAT DAY WAS IT
 THAT YOU WERE OUT THERE
  SEARCHING THIS LAKE ?
THIS WAS ON
11-17 OF '93.
   NOVEMBER 17 OF 1993 ?
YES, SIR.
 THAT'S ALL.
  AS LONG AS THEY GET AN ARREST,
  THEY DON'T CARE.
THE DAMN SYSTEM STINKS !
THEY'RE PLAYING
WITH OUR LIVES,
AND THERE'S NOTHING
RIGHT ABOUT IT.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE NAZI'S,
THEY CAN JUST TAKE
SOMEBODY'S WORD
AND COME IN YOUR HOUSE,
AND TAKE YOU AWAY.
AND BASICALLY
THAT'S WHAT THEY DID
BECAUSE OF WHAT
JESSIE TOLD THEM,
EVEN THOUGH IT HAD ALL THOSE
INCONSISTENCIES IN IT.
IF WE HAD MONEY,
DO YOU THINK THESE 3 BOYS
WOULD'VE BEEN PICKED UP ?
THEY FOUND PEOPLE
THEY KNEW DIDN'T HAVE NE
THE BOYS HAVE BEEN IN
A LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE,
THEY THOUGHT
WE DIDN'T CARE,
THEY WERE WRONG.
THEY'RE<i> BAD</i> WRONG.
I DON'T BELIEVE
THAT CHILDREN
COULD BE
THAT COLD-BLOODED,
AS WHAT HAPPENED
TO THOSE BOYS.
   ( man )
   ON THE STATE'S EXHIBIT, 67-A,
  IT SHOWS THE...
  HOG-TYING FASHION,
THE HANDS WERE HOG-TIED,
TO THE FEET,
BEHIND THE BACK,
 AND THIS IS THE PHOTOGRAPH,
   SHOWING THE SHOE LACES...
( man )
THAT INJURY, YOU SAY,
IS TYPICAL OF A BELT INJURY,
THE BELT HAS
A LITTLE BUCKLE,
AND THAT'S ONE
THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH
   LEFT TO RIGHT,
   THAT'S THE BASE OF THE LATCH.
HERE, THIS
RED AREA HERE,
THIS IS THE
SHAFT OF THE PENIS,
AND HERE IS WHERE
THE SCROTAL SAC
AND TESTES SHOULD BE
AND THEY'RE MISSING.
SO WHAT WE HAVE
IS THE SKIN OVERLYING THE PENIS,
THE HEAD OF THE PENIS,
HAS BEEN CARVED OFF,
IT'S GONE, IT'S NOT THERE.
( defense )
IN LAYMAN'S LANGUAGE,
THAT I UNDERSTAND,
WITH RESPECT,
HIS PENIS HAS NOT
BEEN CUT OFF, HAS IT ?
   NO, THE SKIN HAS BEEN
   TAKEN OFF THE PENIS.
  AND BASICALLY IT WOULD
  TAKE SOME SKILL
   AND PRECISION
   TO DO THAT,
   WOULDN'T IT ?
I WOULD THINK SO.
IF THIS WAS
TO BE DONE,
THIS DISSECTION,
  WHERE THE SKIN IS CUT OFF,
 THAT WOULD TAKE
 A VERY SHARP INSTRUMENT
 WOULD IT NOT ?
   I THINK IT WOULD.
SUCH AS A RAZOR.
   OR A SHARP KNIFE.
A VERY SHARP KNIFE,
DOCTOR, IF YOU
WERE TO DO THIS,
WITH THE SKILL AND PRECISION
AND KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU TAKE,
HOW LONG WOULD IT
TAKE YOU TO DO THAT ?
  ( doctor )
  IT WOULD
  TAKE ME SOME TIME.
( defense )
IT WOULD TAKE YOU LONGER
THAN 5 TO 10 MINUTES ?
   I WOULD THINK SO.
AND THAT'S
IN YOUR LAB.
   I WOULD THINK SO.
WITH A SCALPEL.
IS THAT CORRECT ?
 THAT'S CORRECT.
NOW, DOCTOR IF WE
ADDED TO THE EQUATION
THAT YOU WERE IN THE DARK,
COULD YOU DO THIS
IN THE DARK ?
YOU, DOCTOR, COULD<i> YOU</i>
DO IT IN THE DARK ?
  ( doctor )
  IT'D BE DIFFICULT.
COULD YOU DO THIS
IN THE WATER ?
YOU, DOCTOR, COULD YOU
DO THIS IN THE WATER ?
   I THINK IT WOULD BE
   VERY DIFFICULT TO DO.
   IF YOU WERE DOING IT
   IN THE DARK,
   IN THE WATER,
   WITH MOSQUITOES
   ALL AROUND YOU.
 WOULD THAT MAKE IT EVEN<i>
 MUCH</i> MORE DIFFICULT ?
I WOULD THINK SO.
IT WOULD BE
A VERY TEDIOUS TASK FOR<i> YOU,</i>
A SKILLED PATHOLOGIST.
   IT WOULD.
NOW, ISN'T
IT TRUE, DOCTOR,
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT
5 PINTS OF BLOOD ?
 A LITTLE MORE
 THAN THAT, YES.
OKAY, NOW,
IF I POURED OUT
FIVE PINTS OF BLOOD
OUT HERE
ON ON THE FLOOR,
IT WOULD MAKE A BIG MESS,
WOULDN'T IT ?
   YES.
AND IT WOULD BE
ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN UP.
  YOU CAN DO IT BUT,
  NOT VERY EASILY.
 IT'S NOT EASY
 TO CLEAN BLOOD.
DOES BLOOD
SOAK INTO THE GROUND ?
   YES, IT DOES.
 ( defense )
 DOCTOR, WITH THIS HOMICIDE,
   WE'RE TALKING
   ABOUT HERE TODAY,
 WOULD YOU
 AGREE WITH ME THAT,
  THIS COULD'VE HAPPENED
  IN ONE OF THREE WAYS,
 THESE INJURIES
 COULD'VE HAPPENED IN THE WATER,
  THESE INJURES
  COULD'VE HAPPENED ON THE BANK,
OR COULD'VE HAPPENED
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH ME THOSE
ARE THE THREE POSSIBILITIES
OF HOW THIS
COULD'VE HAPPENED ?
   YES.
NOW, WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE
AMOUNT OF BLOOD THAT WAS LOST,
FROM, NOT ONLY CHRIS BYERS,
BUT THESE OTHER BOYS,
THEY'RE GONNA BLEED
AS WELL, WON'T THEY ?
OH, YES.
DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION
AS TO WHETHER OR NOT
YOU COULD CLEAN UP
THAT AMOUNT OF BLOOD ?
   AT A SCENE,
   IN THE DARK ?
DO YOU HAVE AN
OPINION AS TO THAT ?
I THINK IT WOULD BE
QUITE DIFFICULT TO DO,
TO HAVE...
INJURIES OF THIS NATURE,
WITHOUT HAVING ANY BLOOD...
I WOULD QUESTION THAT
ABOUT THE BLOOD.
UNLESS IT HAPPENED
IN THE WATER
OR IT HAPPENED
SOME OTHER PLACE.
( defense )
AND YOU AGAIN, DOCTOR,
STATED THAT YOU COULDN'T
DO THIS
IN THE WATER ?
  PERSONALLY,
  I DON'T THINK I COULD.
I DON'T GET OFF
ON HURTIN' PEOPLE,
OR INFLICTING PAIN
ON THE REST
OF THE HUMAN RACE,
OR JUST...
CAUSING DESTRUCTION
FOR THE PURPOSE OF DESTRUCTION.
I'VE PROBABLY BEEN IN
ONE OR TWO FIGHTS
MY ENTIRE LIFE.
AND ESPECIALLY A CHILD...
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING TO DESERVE
WHAT THEY GOT.
AND I BELIEVE WHATEVER YOU DO
TO SOMEONE ELSE,
WHETHER IT'S GOOD OR BAD,
IS EVENTUALLY GONNA
COME BACK AROUND TO<i> YOU.</i>
EVEN THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS,
IF THEY'RE NOT
CAUGHT AND PUNISHED,
SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN
IN THEIR LIFE
WHERE THEY
WILL BE PUNISHED.
( girl )
PEOPLE KEPT TELLIN' ME
NOT TO GO OUT WITH DAMIEN
BECAUSE HE WAS LIKE
SOME KIND OF DEVIL WORSHIPER,
AND I MET HIM
IN<i> WAL-MART...</i>
AND HE FOLLOWED ME AROUND
LIKE A PUPPY DOG...
AND WE STARTED TALKING
AND HE WAS REAL SWEET,
NOT LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS
MAKING HIM OUT TO BE,
THAT NIGHT WE
STARTING GOING OUT,
AND IT WAS LIKE A MONTH,
AND HE CALLED ME UP
ON THE TELEPHONE
AT MY DAD'S
GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME ?"
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT ?!"
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME ?"
I SAID, "CAN YOU REPEAT THAT
ONE MORE TIME ?!"
AND HE GOES,
"WILL YOU MARRY ME",
I SAID, "YEAH",
AND WHEN I GOT PREGNANT
I HAD THIS BIG PICTURE
PAINTED IN MY MIND,
DAMIEN'S GONNA BE THERE,
AND I GET TO YELL AT HIM
WHEN I HAVE THE BABY.
AND INSTEAD
I WAS YELLING AT<i> HER.</i>
I MISS HIM SO MUCH.
AND HE HASN'T YET
TO SEE THE BABY,
 THEY WON'T LET HIM<i>
 TOUCH</i> THE BABY.
IT MAKES ME SO PISSED OFF.
I FELT DIFFERENT
WHEN HE WAS BORN IT WAS--
IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE,
I GUESS JUST
REAL GOOD INSIDE...
TO THINK THAT I GAVE LIFE
TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING.
SOMETHING COMPLETELY
SEPARATE FROM ME
BUT STILL PART OF ME.
I JUST HOPE THAT I'LL BE THERE
WHEN HE GROWS UP.
TO WATCH HIM.
 ( prosecutor )
 YOU ARE FAMILIAR
 WITH A FELLOW NAMED
 <i> ALEISTER CROWLEY</i> ?
I KNOW WHO HE IS.
   HE'S THE GUY
   WHO KINDLY PROFESSES,
 HE'S A NOTED AUTHOR
 IN THE FIELD
 OF SATANIC WORSHIP.
I KNOW HE IS
   BUT I NEVER SAW
   ANY OF HIS BOOKS, PERSONALLY.
YOU'RE NOT REALLY MUCH
OF A FOLLOWER OF HIS ?
  I WOULD'VE READ 'EM
  IF I WOULD'VE SAW 'EM,
BUT, I JUST NEVER...
BUT, ALEISTER CROWLEY,
  IS A GUY THAT
  BASED ON HIS WRITINGS,
BELIEVES IN HUMAN SACRIFICE,
DOESN'T HE ?
 HE ALSO BELIEVED
 HE WAS GOD, THOUGH.
AND HE ALSO
HAD WRITINGS
THAT INDICATED
THAT CHILDREN
WERE THE BEST TYPE
OF HUMAN SACRIFICE,
CORRECT ?
  YES, SIR.
  ( prosecutor )
  BUT, ALEISTER CROWLEY
  DOESN'T HAVE ANY
   PARTICULAR
   SIGNIFICANCE TO YOU ?
I KNOW WHO HE IS,
I'VE READ
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIM,
BUT, I NEVER READ
ANYTHING<i> BY</i> HIM.
LET ME SHOW YOU
A COPY OF DOCUMENTS,
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THAT ?
 YES.
WHAT IS THAT ?
 IT WAS THIS PAPER I HAD
 ON DIFFERENT ALPHABETS
 FOR LIKE TRANSLATIONS,
  WHERE YOU CAN WRITE THINGS
  THAT NOBODY COULD READ,
  AND THIS WAS
  ONE OF THE FORMS.
  OH, OKAY,
  WHERE'D YOU
  HAVE THAT AT ?
WHEN DID YOU
WRITE THOSE THINGS OUT ?
SOME TIME BEFORE
I WAS ARRESTED I GUESS.
   ARE YOU SURE THAT
   YOU HADN'T DONE THOSE
   SINCE YOU WERE ARRESTED WHILE
   YOU BEEN STAYING IN JAIL ?
  I DON'T KNOW,
  I MIGHT HAVE.
 ( prosecutor )
 WHO'S NAMES ARE WRITTEN
 ON THAT DOCUMENT ?
 MINE, JASON'S,
 MY SON'S,
 ONE THAT SAYS
 ALEISTER CROWLEY--
WAIT, WAIT !
WHO ?
   ALEISTER CROWLEY.
  THIS IS A DOCUMENT THAT YOU'VE
   WRITTEN WHILE YOU'VE BEEN
  WAITING IN JAIL
  FOR TRIAL, RIGHT ?
  IF YOU SAY SO.
 YOU WROTE IT,
 IT'S YOUR WRITING ?
 MM-HMM.
 DO YOU RECALL
 WHEN YOU WROTE IT ?
   NOT REALLY.
WHAT I'M GONNA ASK YOU IS,
THAT THIS DAMIEN ECHOLS,
YOUR SON,
HE WASN'T BORN UNTIL AFTER YOU
WERE PLACED IN JAIL, CORRECT ?
 YES.
SO IF YOU'VE GOT HIS NAME
LISTED ON THIS DOCUMENT,
THEN THIS DOCUMENT HAD TO BE
GENERATED AFTER HE WAS BORN ?
YES.
SO THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU'VE WRITTEN
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
SITTING IN HERE IN JAIL
WAITING FOR TRIAL.
 YES.
AND WHAT YOU WERE DOING
WAS WRITING OUT VARIOUS NAMES
IN DIFFERENT TYPES
OF ALPHABETS, CORRECT ?
  FROM THE WAY IT LOOKS HERE
  I WAS PRACTICING,
TRYING TO
MEMORIZE THEM.
AND ONE OF THE NAMES THAT YOU
PICKED OUT TO WRITE ABOUT
WAS THIS FELLA NAMED
ALEISTER CROWELY, CORRECT ?
MM-HMM.
IS THAT JUST
A TOTAL COINCIDENCE,
YOU JUST PULLED HIS NAME
OUT OF THE AIR ?
 NO, IT'S THE SAME BOOK
 THAT I HAD
WITH THE DIFFERENT ALPHABETS
   AND IT ALSO HAD STUFF
   ABOUT HIM IN THERE.
DID YOU HAVE THE BOOK OUT AT
THE TIME YOU WERE DOING THIS ?
 THIS WAS JUST FROM WHAT
 I REMEMBERED MYSELF,
I WAS PRACTICING,
TRYING TO MEMORIZE,
  GET IT ALL IN MY HEAD.
SO YOU WERE GOING OVER IT
AND WORKING ON IT,
AND AT THAT POINT IN TIME,
YOU WRITE ALL THIS
DOWN FROM MEMORY ?
 MM-HMM.
( prosecutor )
THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE LISTED HERE,
YOU GOT YOUR NAME
ON HERE, RIGHT ?
  ( Damien )
  MM-HMM.
( prosecutor )
AND JASON BALDWIN, WHICH IS
YOUR BEST FRIEND, RIGHT ?
AND THEN YOU GOT
DAMIEN SETH ECHOLS,
THAT'S YOUR SON ?
 ( Damien )
 YES, IT IS.
( prosecutor )
AND THE ONLY OTHER NAME
ON THIS DOCUMENT,
BESIDES YOURSELF,
YOUR BEST FRIEND, AND YOUR SON,
IS ALEISTER CROWLEY,
CORRECT ?
 YES, SIR.
  ( judge )
  I BELIEVE THIS WITNESS HAS
 REQUESTED NOT
 TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED.
THAT'S CORRECT,
YOUR HONOR.
   WOULD YOU STATE YOUR NAME
   FOR THE JURY ?
CHRISTI VANBICKLE.
DO LIKE YOU JUST DID
AND SPEAK UP
BEST YOU CAN, OKAY ?
   ARE YOU NERVOUS ?
( Christi )
YES.
   DID YOU HEAR SOMEBODY
   SAY SOMETHING
  ABOUT THE MURDER
  OF THE THREE LITTLE BOYS ?
( Christi )
YES, I HEARD DAMIEN ECHOLS SAY
THAT HE KILLED
THE THREE BOYS.
  ( prosecutor )
  WHERE WERE YOU,
  WAS HE SAYIN' THAT TO YOU,
   WHAT WERE YOU DOIN' ?
( Christi )
I WAS WALKING BY
WITH MY FRIEND.
 CHRISTI,
 I'M SCOTT DAVIDSON,
  I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS
  TO ASK YOU TOO, OKAY ?
 FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU
 REMEMBER WHAT DAY THIS WAS
   THAT YOU HEARD THIS ?
NO, SIR.
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'D
EVER SEEN HIM IN YOUR LIFE ?
( Christi )
YES, SIR.
 ( defense )
  WHAT DID HE SAY
 <i> BEFORE</i> HE SAID
   HE KILLED
   THOSE THREE BOYS,
   WHAT DID HE
   SAY BEFORE THAT ?
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.
( defense )
WHAT DID HE
SAY AFTER THAT ?
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.
( defense )
AND HOW CLOSE
WERE YOU TO HIM ?
( Christi )
I WASN'T CLOSE.
  ( defense )
  DID HE SCREAM IT ?
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.
( defense )
DID HE YELL IT ?
( Christi )
I DON'T KNOW.
( prosecutor )
CALL JODY MEDFORD.
( judge )
AGAIN, THIS WITNESS
HAS REQUESTED
NOT TO BE PHOTOGRAPHED.
JODY, I WANT TO
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO
   MAY OF 1993,
   AFTER THE MURDERS
   OF THE THREE LITTLE BOYS.
DID YOU HAVE OCCASION
TO BE AT THE SOFTBALL FIELD
  AND HEAR A COMMENT
  IN REGARD TO THE MURDERS ?
YES, SIR.
TELL THE JURY FIRST,
 WHAT YOU HEARD.
( Jody )
HE SAID
"I KILLED THE LITTLE BOYS
"AND BEFORE I TURN MYSELF IN
I'M GONNA KILL TWO MORE,
AND I ALREADY HAVE
ONE OF 'EM PICKED OUT."
( prosecutor )
YOU DIDN'T RECOGNIZE ANYBODY
ELSE THAT WAS WITH HIM ?
( Jody )
I SAW JASON BALDWIN THERE.
HAD YOU HEARD PEOPLE TALKING
ABOUT DAMIEN BEFORE THIS ?
YES, SIR.
  DID YOU THINK,
DO YOU THINK HE WAS
KIND OF WEIRD OR SOMETHING ?
YES, SIR 'CAUSE HE WAS
DRESSED ALL IN BLACK
AND HIS HAIR WAS
JET BLACK AND LONG
AND SHAVED ON THE SIDE.
( reporter )
TWO TEEN-AGE GIRLS
TOOK THE STAND THIS MORNING
AND THEY SAID THEY HEARD
DAMIEN ECHOLS
CONFESS TO THE MURDERS OF THREE
8 YEAR OLD BOYS LAST MAY,
ONE OF THE GIRLS SAID
SHE OVERHEARD DAMIEN ECHOLS SAY,
"I KILLED THE THREE BOYS,
AND I'M GOING TO KILL TWO MORE,
I ALREADY HAVE
ONE PICKED OUT."
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON,
WHEN THE DEFENSE BEGAN
PRESENTING IT'S WITNESSES,
DAMIEN ECHOLS, HIMSELF
TOOK THE STAND,
HE SAID HE THOUGHT
THE GIRLS WERE LYING
AND THAT THEY WERE
MAKING UP THOSE STATEMENTS.
HE ALSO SAID HE DID NOT
PRACTICE SATANISM,
AND DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT
IN THE MURDERS OF CHRIS BYERS,
MICHAEL MOORE
AND STEVIE BRANCH.
WERE YOU WORKING
AT BOJANGLES RESTAURANT
  ON THE EVENING OF MAY 5TH
OF 1993 ?
YES, SIR.
   COULD YOU TELL US
   WHAT HAPPENED ?
WELL, IT WAS ABOUT
9:30 AT NIGHT,
I FOUND A BLACK GENTLMAN SITTING
IN THE IN THE WOMAN'S RESTROOM
ON THE COMMODE,
AND THERE WAS BLOOD
DRIPPING OFF OF HIS FOREARM,
BUT, HE HAD
MUD ON HIS FEET,
AND HE SEEMED TO BE
DISARRAYED WHEN
I TALKED TO HIM.
I CALLED THE POLICE THEN.
( defense )
WHAT HAPPENED THEN ?
( man )
IT WAS A FEMALE OFFICER
FOR THE WEST MEMPHIS POLICE,
AND SHE PULLED ON THE LOT
AND I SAW HER COMING
SO, I WENT UP
TO THE FRONT DOOR.
SHE KEPT COMIN' AROUND, SHE WENT
TO THE DRIVE THROUGH WINDOW.
  ( defense )
  YOU DID NOT
  GO IN THE RESTAURANT ?
NO, SIR, I DID NOT.
  DID YOU EVER FIND THIS
  BLEEDING BLACK MAN ?
NO, SIR, I DID NOT.
DO YOU HAVE A REPORT THAT YOU
MADE REGARDING THIS INCIDENT ?
   NO, SIR,
   I DO NOT.
AND YOU'RE OUT
LOOKING FOR SOME BOYS,
YOU'RE OUT IN THAT AREA AND
YOU HEAR ABOUT SOMEONE BLEEDING,
DID ANYTHING GO
THROUGH YOUR MIND THINKING,
  SOMETHING MAY BE GOING ON ?
YOU GOTTA UNDERSTAND,
IT'S A DIFFERENT AREA I WENT TO,
IT WAS A DIFFERENT WARD,
   I DID NOT CONNECT
   THE TWO AT ALL.
 ( defense )
 IT MAY HAVE BEEN
 OUTSIDE YOUR WARD,
 BUT, DISTANCE-WISE BETWEEN
 THE AREA WHERE YOU WERE LOOKING
  AND WHERE THIS RESTAURANT WAS,
  IT'S NOT A
  LONG DISTANCE, IS IT ?
  NO, SIR,
  IT'S REALLY NOT.
   ( defense )
   DID ANY OTHER OFFICER
   COME OUT THERE THAT EVENING ?
 NOT THAT EVENING.
WERE YOU WORKING ON
THE DAY OF MAY 6TH OF 1993 ?
YES, SIR,
TWO DETECTIVES CAME OUT
AND THEY TOOK A REPORT
AS FAR AS WHAT I'D SEEN,
DESCRIPTION OF
THE GENTLEMAN,
AND THEN THEY TOOK
BLOOD SCRAPINGS OFF THE WALL.
WHAT IS THE DATE THAT
YOU SENT THE BLOOD SCRAPINGS
OFF TO THE CRIME LAB
TO BE ANALYZED ?
THEY WERE
NEVER SENT.
THEY WERE
NEVER SENT ?
 THAT'S CORRECT.
WHERE ARE THE BLOOD SAMPLES
AT THIS TIME ?
   I DON'T KNOW,
   THEY'RE LOST.
 THAT'S MY MISTAKE,
 I LOST A PIECE OF EVIDENCE.
( Damien )
MOST OF THE TIME HE CAME UP
WITH THE STUPID IDEAS.
I GUESS I INFLUENCED HIM
ABOUT AS MUCH
AS HE INFLUENCED ME.
MOST OF THE TIME
WE DIDN'T REALLY,
SET OUT TO DO
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR.
WE JUST STARTING
HANGING AROUND,
WHATEVER HAPPENED
JUST USUALLY HAPPENED.
SOMETIMES GOOD,
SOMETIMES BAD.
WE'RE JUST SITTING
ON THE COUCH WATCHING TV
THE NIGHT
WE WERE ARRESTED.
PIGS BUSTED IN,
STARTING RUNNIN'
ALL OVER THE HOUSE.
WE TRIED TO HIDE IN THE BEDROOM
WHEN THE COPS FIRST CAME.
THEY WOULDN'T LEAVE !
WE WERE IN THE BEDROOM,
TURNED THE LIGHT OFF,
MAYBE THEY'LL GO AWAY.
 I KNOW YOU'RE
 IN THERE, OPEN UP !
WE SAW ALL
THE LIGHTS GO OUT.
 AND DOMINI
 TURNED 'EM BACK ON.
NO, IT WAS
MY SISTER.
 ( man )
 THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT
 IT IS THE ONE KNIFE,
  THAT WE KNOW SOMEBODY OWNS
IS THE BYERS' KNIFE.
 WE KNOW HE OWNS THAT KNIFE.
HE'S GOT THE MOTIVE,
 HIS SON WHO
 HE'S UPSET WITH,
 HIS SON WAS
 THE ONLY ONE MUTILATED,
  THE OTHER TWO
  WEREN'T MUTILATED,
  HE'S GOT KNOWLEDGE
  ABOUT THE AREA,
HE KNOWS WHEN
THE SEARCH IS OVER WITH,
 HE'S BIG ENOUGH THAT HE CAN
 CARRY THE BOYS THERE
  AND THROW THEM IN,
  HE'S A JEWELER,
 HE'S PRECISE ENOUGH TO HAVE
 COMMITTED THAT MUTILATION,
   ALL OF THE PIECES
   FIT TOGETHER
   WITH SOMEBODY IN
   A DIFFERENT LOCATION,
KILLING THE BOYS
IN A DIFFERENT LOCATION,
  BECAUSE THERE'S NO
  MOSQUITO BITES ON 'EM,
   SO WE KNOW THAT AFTER
   THE BOYS WERE KILLED,
   AND DURING,
   THEY WEREN'T OUTSIDE.
THEY HAD TO BE INSIDE 'CAUSE
THERE'S NO BITES ON 'EM.
 SO THAT MEANS THEY WERE CARRIED
 FROM A DEATH SCENE SOMEPLACE,
  UNCONSCIOUS,
  AND BROUGHT DOWN
  TO THE RIVER,
   AND THEY HAD TO BE KILLED
SHORTLY BEFORE THEY WERE
BROUGHT DOWN THERE,
BECAUSE THEY ALL DIED WITHIN
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.
  SO AFTER THEY WERE
  BLED TO DEATH,
 AFTER THEY WERE BLUDGEONED,
   AND UNCONSCIOUS,
   SOMEBODY HAD TO
   TAKE THOSE THREE,
  TAKE 'EM TO THE SCENE,
  AND DUMP 'EM.
  IN ORDER TO DO THAT,
 YOU GOTTA BE
PHYSICALLY STRONG ENOUGH
   TO CARRY
   AN UNCONSCIOUS KID...
   WHO'S HOG-TIED.
JASON COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT,
   IN HIS BEST DAY,
HE COULDN'T
CARRY A LITTLE BABY,
 WITH THOSE LITTLE
 SKINNY ARMS OF HIS.
SO WHEN WE LOOK
AT THIS WHOLE THING,
 ALL THE PIECES THAT
 THEY TRIED TO PUT TOGETHER,
 NONE OF IT
 FITS WITH JASON
 AND JUST ABOUT
 ALL OF IT FITS
TOWARDS A PERSON
LIKE BYERS.
( prosecutor )
WHEN DID YOU
RECEIVE THAT KNIFE ?
I BELIEVE IT WAS
ON THE 8TH,
I'VE GOT--
IT'S HARD TO MAKE THIS OUT,
"JANUARY THE 8TH, 1994."
   ALRIGHT, AND,
 WHO DID YOU RECEIVE
 THIS KNIFE FROM ?
I RECEIVED IT FROM...
HOW DID I
ACTUALLY RECEIVE IT ?
NO, WHO DID YOU
RECEIVE THE KNIFE FROM ?
I RECEIVED IT FROM...
JOE AND THE PEOPLE
WITH<i> HBO PRODUCTIONS.</i>
O.K.
BRUCE AND...
 WHEREVER HE IS.
  UPON RECEIVING THAT KNIFE,
  WHAT DID YOU DO WITH IT ?
( man )
I SAW WHAT
I THOUGHT TO BE
SOME TYPE OF SUBSTANCE
ON THE KNIFE,
AND NATURALLY I DID NOT
KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
I, IN TURN,
SENT THIS KNIFE
TO GENETIC DESIGN.
  WHEN THE KNIFE
  WAS RECEIVED BY YOUR FIRM,
DID YOU OR YOUR LAB,
  RUN TESTS ON THAT
  PARTICULAR KNIFE ?
THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF
WHAT APPEARED TO BE
BLOOD THAT WAS DRIED,
OR TISSUE IN A CREVICE
ON THE KNIFE,
WHERE THE KNIFE
FOLDS WHEN IT LOCKS.
 THE RESULTS OF THE TEST
 SHOWED US THAT
 THERE WAS<i> DNA</i>
   PRESENT ON THE KNIFE,
   AND THAT WE WERE ABLE
   TO GET A TYPE,
 USING A TEST CALLED
 "HLA-DQ ALPHA".
 AND MR. BYERS HAD THE SAME TYPE
 THAT WAS DETECTED
   FROM THE SPECIMEN
   FROM THE KNIFE.
OKAY, AND WHAT WAS
THE "DQ-ALPHA" TYPE
FOR CHRISTOPHER BYERS ?
 IT WAS ALSO
 THE SAME TYPE.
SO, THE BLOOD
ON THE KNIFE,
AND CHRISTOPHER BYER'S BLOOD,
AND JOHN MARK BYER'S BLOOD
ALL HAD THE SAME TYPE.
   CORRECT.
( defense )
JUDGE, IF I CAN
APPROACH THE WITNESS ?
( judge )
ALRIGHT.
TAKE A LOOK
AT THAT KNIFE.
I WILL CALL THAT,
FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES,
   THE "JOHN MARK BYERS' KNIFE".
   DOCTOR, DID YOU MAKE
   A COMPARISON WITH THIS KNIFE,
  "E-6",
 AND COMPARE THAT
 WITH SOME OF THE WOUNDS
THAT YOU FOUND
ON CHRIS BYERS ?
  YES, I DID.
DOES THAT KNIFE APPEAR
TO BE A SERRATED KNIFE ?
   YES, THIS IS
   A SERRATED KNIFE.
  DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION
   IF SOME OF THE WOUNDS
   THAT YOU FOUND ON CHRIS BYERS
 WERE CONSISTENT WITH WOUNDS
 WHICH WOULD'VE BEEN CAUSED
 BY THAT TYPE
 OF SERRATED KNIFE ?
SOME OF THE WOUNDS
THAT HAVE
THE SMALLER
SERRATED PATTERNS,
COULD HAVE BEEN
INFLICTED WITH A KNIFE
HAVING THIS TYPE
OF SERRATION.
   ( man )
   HOW DO YOU THINK
   THIS HAS GONE OVER SO FAR
ON THE
MARK BYERS' ASPECT ?
( man )
OBVIOUSLY WE THOUGHT
LONG AND HARD
ABOUT MENTIONING A FATHER
AS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT.
   ( man )
   I HATE HAVING
   TO DO THAT,
  BUT THE WAY
  THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE,
   IT'S JUST COMING OUT
   WHETHER WE WANT IT TO OR NOT.
WE HAD SUSPICIONS EVEN
BEFORE THE KNIFE SHOWED UP.
( man )
DO YOU THINK ANYBODY
REALIZES THE REASON
FOR THE THREE DAY DELAY
IN JESSIE'S TRIAL WAS
WAITING ON THAT DNA TEST
TO COME BACK
ON BYERS' KNIFE ?
( man )
I DOUBT IT, AND EVEN
AFTER THE RESULTS CAME BACK,
AND IT SHOWED THAT
IT COULD BE MARK'S BLOOD,
AS WELL AS CHRIS' BLOOD,
THAT DOESN'T ALLEVIATE
THE FACT THAT HE SAID
NO ONE HAD EVER
CUT THEMSELF ON THE KNIFE.
AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE
HAD BLOOD ON IT AT ALL.
DO YOU THINK
THE ARGUMENT AT LEAST
THAT IT WASN'T THAT THE BLOOD
WAS FOUND ON THE BLADE,
WHICH COULD BE
EASILY WIPED OFF,
BUT IT WAS BACK IN THE HINGES
THAT YOU NORMALLY WOULDN'T THINK
IF YOU WERE WIPIN'
OFF THE BLOOD,
YOU WOULDN'T THINK THE BLOOD
WOULD BE INSIDE THE HINGES,
AND THAT'S WHERE THEY FOUND
THAT PARTICULAR BLOOD.
   HOW DO WE
   GET THAT IN ?
 JUST ASK GITCHELL ?
ASK BYERS, WE CAN PUT
BYERS UP ON THE STAND.
 ( man )
 I THINK THE JURY
 EXPECTS TO SEE HIM NOW.
 THEY WANNA SEE
 WHAT HE HAS TO SAY,
DON'T YOU THINK SO ?
  I THINK SO.
MR. BYERS,
I NEED TO ASK YOU ABOUT,
DEFENSE EXHIBIT
NUMBER "E-6",
   THIS PARTICULAR
   FOLDING LOCK-BLADE KNIFE.
  IF I CAN APPROACH
  THE WITNESS YOUR HONOR ?
  ( judge )
  YES.
TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT KNIFE, PLEASE.
  HAD THAT KNIFE
  EVER BEEN USED BEFORE ?
  USED FOR WHAT ?
  USED FOR ANY PURPOSE ?
I HAD...
 TRIMMED ME
 TOENAILS WITH IT,
 I HAD ATTEMPTED TO
 TRIM ON
 SOME VENISON THAT I HAD.
  YOU ATTEMPTED
  "TO TRIM ON SOME VENISON",
  WHEN WAS IT THAT YOU ATTEMPTED
  TO TRIM ON SOME VENISON ?
SOME TIME AROUND
THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAYS.
   DO YOU RECALL BEING ASKED
   ON JANUARY THE 26TH,
 THIS IS ON PAGE 3,
 BY INSP. GITCHELL,
 "HAD YOU EVER TAKEN
 THAT KNIFE HUNTING,
  OR USED IT RECENTLY ?"
 DO YOU REMEMBER BEING ASKED
 THAT QUESTION BY GITCHELL ?
SPECIFICALLY, NO, SIR,
HE ASKED ME A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
 DO YOU REMEMBER
 GIVING THE ANSWER "NO,
 "THAT KNIFE HAD NOT
 BEEN USED AT ALL,
  "IT HAD JUST BEEN KEPT UP,
  PUT IN MY DRESSER,
  "AND I DIDN'T USE IT,
  AND THE REASON WHY WAS BECAUSE
  OF THE SERRATED EDGES."
  DO YOU RECALL
  GIVING THAT ANSWER
 TO GITCHELL
 ON THE 26TH ?
NO, SIR,
I DON'T RECALL
GIVING HIM
THAT EXACT ANSWER.
I'M SURE HIS QUESTION
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ASKED
EXACTLY LIKE YOUR QUESTION.
  DID GITCHELL TELL YOU,
"LET ME EXPLAIN
A PROBLEM WE HAD,
 "AND YOU NEED TO ANSWER
 THIS FROM ME,
   WE HAVE FOUND
   BLOOD ON THIS KNIFE",
DID GITCHELL ASK YOU
THAT QUESTION ?
I DON'T REMEMBER IF HE SAID
THERE WAS OR NOT.
   DID YOU TELL GITCHELL
   YOU HAD NO IDEA
HOW CHRIS' BLOOD
COULD BE ON THAT KNIFE ?
( Byers )
YES, SIR, I WOULD NOT
HAVE ANY IDEA,
IF HIS BLOOD
WAS ON THAT KNIFE,
I WOULD NOT KNOW
HOW IT GOT THERE.
   DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
   HOW HUMAN BLOOD
   WAS ON THAT KNIFE ?
YES, I WOULD HAVE AN IDEA,
I CUT MY THUMB.
   ALRIGHT,
ISN'T IT TRUE THAT YOU
NEVER TOLD GITCHELL ON JAN. 26TH
THAT YOU EVER CUT YOUR THUMB
WITH THAT PARTICULAR KNIFE,
   DID YOU ?
YES, SIR, IT SEEMS LIKE
DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY
I DID TELL HIM THAT.
WAS THAT DURING THE TAPED
CONVERSATION OR WAS THAT AFTER ?
I DON'T REMEMBER.
OKAY, ON THE TOP
OF PAGE 8,
   DO YOU RECALL
   BEING ASKED THE QUESTION,
"I HAVE NO IDEA,
NO IDEA,
  "HOW IT COULD HAVE
 ANY HUMAN BLOOD ON IT",
DO YOU RECALL
GIVING THAT ANSWER ?
YES, SIR.
 THEN DO YOU RECALL STATING,
 "I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
 NICKING MYSELF WITH IT,
   CUTTING THE DEER MEAT
   OR<i> ANYTHING."</i>
  IS THAT THE ANSWER
  YOU GAVE ?
YES, SIR.
 AND IS THAT THE TRUTH ?
AT THE TIME WHEN
HE WAS QUESTIONING ME,
I MIGHT NOT HAVE REMEMBERED,
WE WERE GETTING READY
TO GO INTO A TRIAL...
DID YOU REMEMBER
ON THIS DATE
   CUTTING YOURSELF
   WITH THE VENISON,
  OR NOT
  CUTTING YOURSELF ?
THE DATE THAT
GARY QUESTIONED--
   YES, SIR.
I MIGHT NOT HAVE
REMEMBERED IT AT THAT TIME,
WHEN HE WAS
QUESTIONING ME,
BUT, I COULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT
LATER ON IN THE DAY
AND TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT.
 EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON,
  HAD YOU GIVEN
  CHRIS A WHIPPING ?
  APPROXIMATELY AROUND 5:30.
ABOUT 5:30,
WAS THIS WITH A BELT ?
 YES, SIR.
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU
HIT HIM WITH THE BELT ?
   I SPANKED HIM
   TWO OR THREE TIMES.
AND WHAT PART OF THE BODY
DID YOU SPANK HIM ?
 IT WOULD'VE BEEN
 JUST ON HIS BEHIND.
  WAS HE WEARING HIS PAINTS,
   OR DID YOU HAVE HIM
   PULL HIS PANTS DOWN ?
   NO, HE HAD ON
   BLUE JEANS.
THE JUDGE BACK THERE
DURING THAT LAST RECESS
BEFORE YOU WERE
RECALLED HERE,
SAYS THAT YOU HAVE
A BRAIN TUMOR
AND YOU'RE BEING TREATED,
DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT THAT,
IS IT TRUE ?
IT'S BEEN RUMORED.
  YES, I HAVE
  A BRAIN TUMOR.
AND YOU'RE
BEING TREATED ?
 YES, I'M BEING
 TREATED FOR IT.
I NEED TO
ASK YOU ONE QUESTION
AND I HOPE YOU
WON'T GET ANGRY,
BUT HAS
EVEN THE SUGGESTION
THAT YOU MAY HAVE HAD
SOMETHING TO DO WITH
THE MURDERS OF THESE BOYS
CAUSED ANY PROBLEMS
WITHIN YOUR FAMILY
OR WITH ANY OF THE OTHER
VICTIM'S FAMILIES ?
( woman )
NO.
 THEY ALL THE KNOW
 THE TRUTH AND, NO.
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THESE BOY'S DEATHS ?
  NO MORE THAN YOU DID.
( reporter )
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE
BUYING A NEW HOUSE,
THAT YOU'RE LEAVING
WEST MEMPHIS ?
  ( Byers )
  I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
   WE MIGHT TRY TO MOVE.
( reporter )
OUT OF WEST MEMPHIS ?
WELL,<i> SOMEWHERE,</i>
   <i> YOU</i> WOULD
    PROBABLY WANNA MOVE.
 YOU KNOW ?
   DID YOU SAY WHERE
   YOU WERE GONNA MOVE ?
   NO.
 ( woman )
 LET ME ASK YOU
 A QUESTION,
 WOULD YOU WANNA
 LIVE IN A HOUSE
 THAT YOUR BABY DIED LESS THAN
 3/4 OF A MILE FROM ?
 I WOULDN'T, NO.
THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION.
( reporter )
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY, RIGHT ?
YOU'RE NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU ?
( Byers )
YOU WOULDN'T MOVE AND LEAVE
YOUR WIFE AND CHILDREN SOMEWHERE
 WOULD YOU ?
( reporter )
NOT IF WE WERE
GONNA STAY TOGETHER.
   ( Byers )
   O.K.
   SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK
   ARE KIND OF RIDICULOUS,
   SOME OF 'EM ARE KINDA
   ODD OR STRANGE
   OR DIFFERENT,
   HOW EVER YOU'D LIKE
   TO COMMENT ON 'EM,
  BUT, SOME OF 'EM SEEM LIKE YOU
  JUST USE A LITTLE COMMON SENSE
   AND THINK ABOUT
   WHAT YOU WOULD DO
   OR HOW YOU WOULD FEEL.
   SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
   YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK.
( reporter )
WE HAVE TO ASK THEM,
WE CAN'T
QUOTE OURSELVES.
I KNOW, BUT A LOT OF TIMES
THINGS ARE PRINTED IN THE PAPER
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT SAY
AND THE NEWS MEDIA,
I'M NOT STATING
WHICH INDIVIDUAL,
SAYS THEY GOT IT FROM
A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMER,
AND YOU DON'T LIKE TO TURN YOUR
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMER OVER,
WHEN YOU'RE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMER IS YOUR IMAGINATION.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
THAT PRINTED IN THE PAPER
THAT PEOPLE DID NOT SAY.
BUT THE MEDIA
HAS THE RIGHTS TO PRINT
WHAT THEY WANNA PRINT.
VICTIMS DON'T
HAVE ANY RIGHTS.
 NOW THAT I'VE
 HEARD HIM TALK...
 I KINDA HAD AN IDEA
 OF WHAT HE WAS LIKE
  BEFORE HE TALKED,
   BUT AFTER HE TALKED
 HE WASN'T ANYTHING LIKE
 I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE.
( reporter )
HOW IS HE ?
  I SEE HIM NOW AS MORE LIKE
  A HUMAN BEING
 THAN I DID BEFORE.
   NOW I SEE HIM AS
   HAVING A PERSONALITY.
FROM A DEFENSE STANDPOINT,
I'VE NEVER BEEN
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY, BUT,
TO PUT HIM
ON THE WITNESS STAND,
SURE SEEMS TO BE
AN AWFUL BIG GAMBLE.
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THAT MINDSET
THAT PUTS YOU IN THE POSITION
WHERE YOU'RE WILLING
TO TAKE THAT GAMBLE.
( man )
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU
FOLLOW IT UP
WITH MR. BOJANGLES'
ACCUSATIONS.
IT DIDN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.
'CAUSE TO ME,
IF I WERE ON THE JURY,
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE
SOMETHING DESPERATE,
THEY'RE GONNA
CAST BLAME ON ANYBODY
AND EVERYBODY THEY CAN.
AND THE DEFENSE
DIDN'T HAVE THE THE GUTS
 TO ACTUALLY ASK HIM
 DID HE DO IT ?
THE SONG THAT I REALLY
CAN RELATE TO
BY<i> METALLICA</i>
IS "SANITARIUM".
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE ALL THOSE
TIMES I WAS PUT IN THE HOSPITAL
I DIDN'T NEED IT.
IT WAS JUST THE POLICE,
ANOTHER WAY FOR THEM
SETTING ME UP,
WHEN THEY COULDN'T
SEND ME TO PRISON.
WE'LL GET HIM OUT OF OUR WAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE,
BY SENDING HIM
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
I LIKE METALLICA BECAUSE,
WELL, ALL...
HARD MUSIC LIKE THAT,
BECAUSE,
IT GIVES ME AN
ADRENALINE RUSH.
MAKES ME FEEL MORE ALIVE.
   NOW DURING THE COURSE OF,
  TALKING TO MR. ECHOLS,
DID YOU ASK HIM,
   WHO DID HE THINK
   DID IT AND WHY ?
   IN ONE AREA HE SAYS
   HE HAD AN OPINION
   FOR WHO COULD'VE
   DONE THE MURDERS,
   AS BEING SOMEONE SICK,
   AND IT WAS SOME TYPE OF
   THRILL KILL,
   HE ALSO STATED
   THAT THE PENIS
   WAS A SYMBOL OF POWER
   IN HIS RELIGION,
   KNOWN AS "WICCA",
HE ALSO STATED
THAT THE NUMBER 3
HAS A SACRED NUMBER
IN THE BELIEF.
( prosecutor )
DID HE TELL YOU ANYTHING
ABOUT DEMONIC FORCES ?
( man )
YES, HE SAID THAT ALL PEOPLE
HAVE A DEMONIC FORCE IN THEM
AND THAT A PERSON
WOULD HAVE NO CONTROL
OVER THAT DEMONIC FORCE.
   ( defense )
   MR. ECHOLS WAS NOT THE
   ONLY PERSON THAT TOLD YOU
THAT THE KIDS PROBABLY
DIED OF MUTILATION, WAS HE ?
( man )
NO, SIR.
  ( defense )
  AND, WHEN, MR. ECHOLS,
  YOU ASKED HIM,
  WHAT TYPE OF BOOKS
  DID HE ENJOY READING ?
( man )
YES, SIR.
   UM...
 AND HE TOLD YOU<i>
 ANTON LEVY</i>
  AND<i> STEPHEN KING</i> ?
YES, SIR.
 IN YOUR OPINION IS
 THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL
   ABOUT THOSE BEING THE
   TYPE OF BOOKS THAT HE LIKES ?
   ANTON LEVY,
IS A BOOK OF
SATANIC RULES
AND INVOLVEMENT.
STEPHEN KING'S
SEEMS TO BE HORROR MOVIES,
HORROR BOOKS.
YOU'RE ASKING IF I FELT
THAT WAS STRANGE, YES I DID.
   NOW LET ME REFER YOU BACK
   TO YOUR STATEMENT
THAT YOU GAVE
OFFICER RIDGE.
   DID YOU TELL HIM
   IN THAT STATEMENT
   THAT YOU
   HAD BEEN A MEMBER
  OF A WHITE WITCH GROUP
  FOR 5 YEARS ?
  NO.
 ( Damien )
 I'VE NEVER BEEN
 A MEMBER OF ANY GROUP.
IF HE PUT THAT IN HIS REPORT
YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S INACCURATE.
YES, I AM.
HE MADE THAT UP.
YES I AM.
ON QUESTION NUMBER NINE,
HOW DO YOU THINK
THE PERSON FEELS
THAT DID THIS ?
 THE ANSWER WAS,
 "PROBABLY MAKES THEM FEEL GOOD,
  GIVES THEM POWER."
  NOW, I GUESS OFFICER RIDGE
  SAID THAT TOO.
NO, I USED
COMMON SENSE ON THAT.
IF SOMEONE WAS DOING IT,
THEY MUST'VE<i> WANTED</i> TO,
AND IF THEY WERE DOING SOMETHING
THEY<i> WANTED</i> TO
IT MUST'VE
MADE THEM HAPPY.
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE DOIN' IT
'CAUSE SOMEONE FORCED THEM TO
OR BECAUSE THEY
DIDN'T WANT TO.
 SO, IN YOUR MIND...
THE PERSON THAT
KILLED THESE THREE KIDS,
  IT'S COMMON SENSE THAT
  KILLING THREE 8 YEARS OLDS
  WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD.
WHOEVER DID IT,
IT MUST HAVE.
   ( prosecutor )
   DID YOU ALSO TELL HIM
THAT EACH PERSON HAD
A DEMONIC SIDE TO THEM ?
( Damien )
I BELIEVE EVERY PERSON HAS
A GOOD SIDE AND A BAD SIDE.
  WERE THOSE YOUR WORDS,
WHAT HE'S GOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE,
YOU STATED THAT
   THAT THERE WAS NO CONTROL
   OF THE DEMONIC FORCE
   IN A PEOPLE ?
HE ASKED ME DID I THINK
THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE
THAT COULD NOT
CONTROL THAT SIDE,
I SAID YES,
I GUESS THERE IS.
  ( prosecutor )
  IT ALSO STATES THAT YOU STATED
  THAT THE YOUNGER THE VICTIM
   WOULD MEAN MORE INNOCENT,
  AND IN TURN MORE POWER
   WOULD BE GIVEN THE PERSON
   DOING THE KILLING.
   RIGHT.
  DID YOU SAY THAT ?
 YES.
   THOSE ARE YOUR WORDS.
 DID YOU PICK THAT UP WHEN
 STUDYING TO BE A CATHOLIC ?
NO.
I SAW THAT ON
SEVERAL MOVIES, BOOKS.
  ( prosecutor )
  QUESTION #11,
 WHEN HE ASKED YOU,
 HOW DO YOU THINK THEY DIED,
 THE ANSWER IS,
   "MUTILATION,
   CUT UP ALL THREE,
  "HEARD THEY WERE
  IN THE WATER DROWNING,
 CUT UP ONE MORE
 THAN THE OTHERS..."
 IS THAT AGAIN
 WHAT OFFICER RIDGE SAID
   AND YOU JUST AGREED ?
 NO, I SAW THAT ON TV,
 NEWSPAPERS,
 PEOPLE TALKIN'.
  AND...
 YOU KNEW ABOUT
 THE DROWNING, CORRECT ?
I KNEW THAT THEY WERE
IN THE WATER,
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT THEY DROWNED.
   YOU KNEW THAT ONE WAS
   CUT UP MORE THAN THE OTHERS ?
HE SAID, "DO YOU THINK ONE WAS
HURT WORSE THAN THE OTHERS ?"
 OH, SO AGAIN,
 THAT PARTICULAR AREA'S,
ONE OF THOSE THINGS
WHERE OFFICER RIDGE TOLD YOU
 AND THAT WASN'T
 YOUR RESPONSE,
YOU JUST RESPONDED ABOUT
THE DROWNING AND MUTILATION.
IF HE DIDN'T GET
THE ANSWER HE LIKED,
HE WOULD GO BACK AND TRY TO
GET ME TO SAY SOMETHING ELSE.
AND IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY,
SPECIFICALLY,
THAT YOU WEREN'T
THE ONE WHO SAID
THAT ONE WAS CUT UP
MORE THAN THE OTHER,
   THAT IT WAS OFFICER RIDGE
   WHO SAID THAT.
I AGREED WITH HIM
WHEN HE SAID THAT.
AND IF HE SAYS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT,
   HE'D BE LYING
   ABOUT IT, RIGHT ?
  YOU'RE THE ONE
  TELLIN' THE TRUTH.
I WOULDN'T
PUT IT PAST HIM.
  ( man )
  DAMIEN, WE'RE GETTING
  CLOSE TO THE END NOW.
   HOW DO YOU
   FEEL SO FAR ?
I FEEL GOOD SO FAR.
TO ME IT LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT IT BEAT.
   ( man )
   WHAT DO YOU THINK THE
   WORST THING FOR US HAS BEEN ?
  IN THE THREE WEEKS
  WE'VE BEEN HERE,
 WHAT HAS
 HURT THE MOST ?
I ONLY KNOW OF TWO THINGS
THAT HAVE REALLY HURT,
THAT ONE KID GETTIN'
UP THERE FOR JASON,
AND THOSE GIRLS.
( man )
THE THURSDAY'S NEWSPAPER
WHICH ADDRESSED YOU
TESTIFYING ON WEDNESDAY,
  WAS REAL GOOD,
  IT TALKED ABOUT
  THAT YOU DID WELL,
BUT FRIDAY'S,
REGARDING YOUR THURDAY TESTIMONY
 WASN'T AS GOOD,
 WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
I THINK I DID REAL GOOD
THE FIRST DAY,
THE SECOND DAY
IT DIDN'T LOOK AS GOOD,
BECAUSE THEY KEPT TRYING
TO TRIP ME UP OR SOMETHING.
( man )
THERE WAS ONE POINT IN THERE
WHERE HE ASKED YOU
 HE SAYS "IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR
 JUST CHANGIN' YOUR STORY,
 TO FIT
 WHATEVER COMES UP",
AND YOU SAID "YEAH".
I WAS JUST LIKE
HALFWAY LISTENING TO HIM.
I WAS REAL NERVOUS
WHEN I FIRST GOT UP THERE,
ENOUGH TO KEEP MY
ATTENTION FOCUSED,
AFTER I WAS
UP THERE A FEW MINUTES,
I JUST STARTED DAY DREAMING.
 "DAY DREAMING".
( laughs )
 MAYBE THEY'LL ONLY HALFWAY
 KILL YOU WHEN THEY CONVICT YOU.
"HALFWAY" ?
HOW DO THEY DO THAT ?
   I DON'T KNOW,
 MAYBE THEY'LL START
 DAY DREAMING.
ANYTHING WRONG WITH WEARING
BLACK IN AND OF ITSELF ?
   NO.
ANYTHING WRONG WITH
THE HEAVY METAL STUFF ?
NO...
THE BOOK,
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT ?
NO, BUT WHEN
YOU LOOK AT IT TOGETHER,
YOU BEGIN TO SEE INSIDE
DAMIEN ECHOLS,
YOU SEE INSIDE
THAT PERSON,
AND YOU LOOK INSIDE THERE
AND THERE'S NOT A SOUL IN THERE.
MY CLIENT IS A TEEN-AGER,
AND WE CERTAINLY DIDN'T
HIDE THAT FACT FROM YA.
AND THE FACT THAT MY CLIENT
DID SOME WRITINGS,
TAKE THESE BACK,
GO BACK AND READ 'EM,
BUT THIS, IN AND OF ITSELF,
IS NO EVIDENCE OF MURDER,
AND EVEN IF YOU ADDED
ALL THE OTHER THINGS,
"TRAPPINGS OF OCCULTISM",
ACCORDING TO
DR. GRIFFIS,
THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS CASE WHATSOEVER.
IS IT A COINCIDENCE...
THAT THIS KNIFE IS FOUND,
IN THE LAKE,
HIDDEN...
BEHIND JASON BALDWIN'S HOUSE ?
THERE ARE MARKS
ON CHRISTOPHER BYERS,
WHERE YOU GOT
LIKE A DASH,
WHERE IT'S A CUT,
A CUT, AN OPEN SPACE,
A CUT, AN OPEN SPACE.
AND IF YOU TAKE
THIS KNIFE
AND YOU DO THAT,
YOU CAN SEE IT LEAVES
A CUT AND AN OPEN SPACE,
A CUT AND AN OPEN SPACE.
NOW, IF YOU TAKE...
<i> THIS</i> KNIFE...
EXHIBIT...
DEFENSE EXHIBIT SIX...
AND EVEN WITH
THE SLIGHTEST PRESSURE,
IT MAKES A STRAIGHT LINE.
 CRIME SCENE...
 IT DOESN'T FIT FOR A KID
 TO BLEED TO DEATH,
 AND NOT LEAVE
 A DROP BEHIND.
 FOR ALL THE OTHER INJURIES
 TO THEIR FACES,
 THESE OTHER INJURIES
 ARE GONNA BLEED TOO.
 AND THERE'S NOT
 A DROP OF BLOOD ?
 NOT A DROP OF BLOOD ?
LOOK AT HISTORY,
LOOK AT HUNDREDS OF YEARS
OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY.
THERE HAVE BEEN HUNDREDS
OF PEOPLE KILLED
IN THE NAME OF RELIGION.
IT IS A MOTIVATING FORCE,
IT GIVES PEOPLE
WHO WANT TO DO EVIL,
WANT TO COMMIT MURDERS,
A REASON TO DO
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
( defense )
SATANIC PANIC.
YEAH, THAT'S A SCARY THING.
IT'S A SCARIER THING TO CONVICT
SOMEONE WITH NO EVIDENCE,
IF YOU CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT,
IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,
LET'S CALL IT
A CULT KILLING,
AND FIND
SOMEBODY WEIRD !
FIND SOMEBODY
WHO WEARS BLACK !
BUT, THEY LET ONE THING
GO BY THE WAYSIDE...
IS THAT THERE'S NOTHING
THAT LINKS JASON
TO THESE ACTIVITIES.
NOT ONE WITNESS SAYS,
"THAT'S WHAT HE DOES,
THAT'S HIS BELIEFS".
WE DON'T HAVE A WRITING,
A DRAWING, A PICTURE,
NOT A PERSON,<i> NOTHING...</i>
LINKS HIM TO IT.
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER.
THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO THEM !
BECAUSE HE'S SITTIN'
OVER THERE WITH DAMIEN,
THEY WANT YOU
TO CONVICT HIM.
GUILT BY ASSOCIATION
IS A HORRIBLE THING.
( reporter )
DAMIEN, DO YOU THINK
HE LOOKS LIKE YOU ?
   I DON'T KNOW,
   NOT REALLY.
I THINK HE'S GOT
DOMINI'S EARS.
( reporter )
CAN YOU CHANGE
HIS DIAPERS, DAMIEN ?
( reporter )
DO YOU THINK
YOU'LL BE SPENDING
MORE TIME
WITH YOUR CHILD ?
I HOPE.
  ( man )
  C'MON, DAMIEN,
  IT'S TIME.
( man )
WHAT'S HIS FIRST WORDS
GONNA BE, "NOT GUILTY" ?
HIS FIRST WORDS WILL BE
"CAPITAL MURDER".
( man )
WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO
GO THROUGH A MONTH LONG TRIAL
ACCUSED OF SOMETHING
YOU DIDN'T DO ?
   HORRIBLE.
ARE YOU NERVOUS NOW ?
   YEAH.
THERE'S NOTHIN' WE CAN DO NOW
BUT SIT AROUND AND WAIT,
BUT, YOU GOT ANYTHING
YOU WANNA ASK ME ?
 WHERE DO WE GO WHEN
 THE JURY COMES BACK OUT
AND SAYS
I'M NOT GUILTY ?
WHERE DO YOU WANNA GO ?
  <i> DISNEYLAND</i> MAYBE.
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO<i> DISNEYLAND</i> ?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
ON A TRIP AT ALL ?
  <i> THE SPRINGS.</i>
WELL I TELL YOU
WHAT, MY MAN,
IT WOULD BE A JOY
TO TAKE YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO ?
 YEAH.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND NOW
WHY WE DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO TESTIFY ?
   YEAH.
DO YOU SEE HOW THAT HURT DAMIEN,
I THINK IT DID.
DID YOU SEE HOW THEY
TALKED ABOUT HIS WITNESSES ?
THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO TALK ABOUT US,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO TALK ABOUT,
'CAUSE WE DIDN'T
GIVE 'EM A CHANCE.
AND...
OH, MAN.
IT'S HEAVY.
DO YOU THINK THAT
THIS WILL CHANGE AT ALL...
HOW YOU CHOOSE
YOUR FRIENDS ?
   YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS WILL DO
TO YOU AND YOUR
FRIENDSHIP WITH DAMIEN ?
   STOP IT, I GUESS.
WOULD YOU STOP
BEING HIS FRIEND ?
I WOULDN'T BE HIS ENEMY,
 BUT, I PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T BE AROUND.
YOU HEARD WHAT WAS
SAID ABOUT HIM.
DO YOU THINK HE
COULD'VE DONE IT ?
  ABOUT WHAT THEY SAID ?
DO YOU THINK
DAMIEN COULD'VE
KILLED THOSE LITTLE BOYS ?
   THEY MADE IT
   SEEM LIKE HE DID.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?
   I DON'T KNOW.
IF YOU WERE
ON THAT JURY
WOULD YOU HAVE A HARD TIME
LETTING HIM GO ?
BASED ON
WHAT YOU HEARD ?
   YEAH.
I WOULD TOO.
WOULD YOU
LET YOURSELF GO ?
  YEAH.
  IF I WAS...
  UP THERE
  I'D LET MYSELF GO.
  THAT'S THE ANSWER
  I WANNA HEAR.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW YOU
DIDN'T DO IT, DON'T YOU ?
   YEAH.
   ( man )
   DID PAUL SURPRISE YOU
   ON HIS CLOSING ?
I THINK PAUL
SHOULD'VE LEFT OUT
THE GUILT
BY ASSOCIATION PART.
   HE CAME OUT HARD ON THAT,
   DIDN'T HE ?
  DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
  HE WAS GONNA DO THAT ?
MM-MMM.
I THOUGHT HE'D BE SMART ENOUGH
TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT.
HURT YOUR FEELINGS ?
I WANTED TO
STRANGLE HIM.
 WERE YOU
 WATCHING THE JURY ?
MM-HMM.
HOW DO YOU PICK IT ?
WITH MY FINGER.
( laughs )
NOW, I THINK IT WAS
PROBABLY ABOUT 60-40.
40 FOR US,
AND 60 AGAINST US.
ONCE YOU GET OUTTA HERE,
YOU GONNA BUY THE BEER ?
THE WHISKEY.
I DON'T WANT BEER.
AND I'LL BUY
THE BOJANGLES' CHICKEN.
I WANNA GET A CIGAR,
CUT IT OPEN AND DUMP
ALL THE TOBACCO OUT,
FILL IT UP WITH MARIJUANA,
SMOKE THE WHOLE THING.
WE GOTTA
GET YOU OUT OF HERE,
YOU GOTTA GO TO WORK
AND PAY MY BILL.
I'LL GET A JOB AT
A GAS STATION OR SOMETHING,
CHANGE MY NAME
TO "BOB SMITH".
ALRIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE BAILIFF'S INFORMED ME
THAT YOU'VE ARRIVED AT VERDICTS,
IF YOU HAVE, PASS THEM
TO THE BAILIFF OR THE SHERIFF.
THE FIRST VERDICT
READS AT AS FOLLOWS,
"WE THE JURY FIND DAMIEN ECHOLS
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
"IN THE DEATH
OF STEVIE BRANCH,
"WE THE JURY FIND DAMIEN ECHOLS
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
"IN THE DEATH OF
CHRIS BYERS,
"WE THE JURY FIND DAMIEN ECHOLS
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
"IN THE DEATH
OF MICHAEL MOORE.
"WE THE JURY FIND JASON BALDWIN
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
"IN THE THE DEATH
OF CHRIS BYERS,
"WE THE JURY FIND JASON BALDWIN
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
"IN THE DEATH
OF STEVIE BRANCH,
"WE THE JURY FIND JASON BALDWIN
GUILTY OF CAPITAL MURDER
IN THE DEATH
OF MICHAEL MOORE",
ALL OF THE VERDICTS
WERE SIGNED BY THE FOREMAN,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IT'S NECESSARY AT THIS TIME
THAT THE COURT
POLL THE JURY,
AS TO ALL SIX VERDICTS,
SO WHEN YOUR
NAME IS CALLED,
IF THESE SIX VERDICTS
REPRESENT YOUR
INDIVIDUAL VERDICT,
THEN ANSWER "YES"
AS YOUR NAME IS CALLED.
JUROR NUMBER ONE.
   ( woman )
   YES.
JUROR NUMBER TWO.
   ( woman )
   YES.
JUROR NUMBER THREE.
   ( woman )
   YES.
JUROR NUMBER SEVEN.
   ( woman )
   YES.
THE PROSECUTION DIDN'T
HAVE ANY EVIDENCE,
BUT THEY DON'T CARE.
JUST BECAUSE
SOMEBODY WEARS BLACK
AND HAS DIFFERENT BELIEFS,
THEY'RE GONNA CONVICT THEM
OF SOMETHING.
   ( woman )
   POOR, POOR PARENTS,
   YEAH, I'M SORRY FOR 'EM--
( Domini )
I AIN'T,
I AIN'T SORRY FOR 'EM.
 ( woman )
 I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
 ABOUT THE PARENTS,
  BUT I'M SORRY
  FOR THE KIDS.
 ( sobbing )
 I AIN'T,
AIN'T SORRY FOR AN.
( woman )
THERE'S NO REASON TO
   KILL THREE<i> MORE</i> BOYS.
 THAT DIDN'T DO
 A DAMN THING.
( woman )
RIGHT NOW I WISH
I WAS A WITCH,
TALK ABOUT
A SPELL ON SOMEBODY.
  BOY, I'D PUT
  A GOOD ONE ON.
I GUESS GITCHELL GOES OUT
WITH A BIG "BANG",
YOU KNOW HE'S FUCKIN'
GONNA RETIRE.
   ( woman )
   NOW HE'S PROBABLY
   GONNA RUN FOR OFFICE.
I GOT AN OFFICE FOR HIM.
 MAYOR OF HELL.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED
WEST MEMPHIS CAN GO TO HELL.
   ( woman )
   WEST MEMPHIS<i> IS</i> HELL.
I HAVE PUT
MY 20 YEARS IN,
AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS
THE LAST CASE
I'LL HAVE
OF THIS MAGNITUDE,
HOPEFULLY,
IT'S MY LAST CASE.
AND...
I'M LEAVING
ON A HIGH NOTE.
SO THERE'S NO BETTER
WAY TO LEAVE
THAN YOUR HEAD UP,
HIGH AND PROUD.
 WELL YOU KNOW,
 I DON'T--
   I'M NOT SURPRISED,
   IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.
 I TOLD YOU EARLIER,
   I THOUGHT THE EVIDENCE
   WAS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT
   TO MAKE THOSE FINDINGS.
 THEY WON'T KILL
 NO MORE BABIES.
 NO MORE BABIES
 WILL THEY KILL.
LET'S GO.
( woman )
YOU'RE GONNA GET OUT !
( man )
YOU'RE GONNA
FRY, DAMIEN !
( woman )
YOU'RE GONNA FRY, DAMIEN !
( man )
WE KNOW YOU'RE
INNOCENT, JASON !
I KNEW FROM WHEN
I WAS REAL SMALL,
THAT PEOPLE WERE
GONNA KNOW WHO I WAS,
I ALWAYS HAD THAT FEELIN',
BUT, I JUST NEVER KNEW HOW
THEY WERE GONNA LEARN.
I KINDA ENJOY IT,
'CAUSE NOW EVEN AFTER I DIE,
PEOPLE ARE GONNA
REMEMBER ME FOREVER,
THEY'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT ME FOR YEARS,
PEOPLE IN
WEST MEMPHIS WILL
TELL THEIR KIDS STORIES,
IT'LL BE SORT OF LIKE
I'M THE WEST MEMPHIS BOOGEY MAN.
LITTLE KIDS WILL BE
LOOKIN' UNDER THEIR BED,
"DAMIEN MIGHT BE
UNDER THERE."
