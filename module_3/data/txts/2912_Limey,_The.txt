Edward Roel?
Eduardo Roel.
Edward Roel?
Eduardo Roel.
You're home, then.
My name's Wilson.
Wilson?
You wrote me
about my daughter.
Oh, uh... yeah, come in.
- Who done it, then?
- Huh?
Snuffed her?
What are you talkin' about?
I sent you
the newspaper clipping, OK.
I tell you everything I know.
I never said anything
about anybody being snuffed.
Look.
There was an investigation, OK?
The car was totalled.
Jenny was...
Her neck was broken they say,
on impact.
So she wouldn't have felt
the effects of the fire.
Those streets up them hills,
man you gotta' be careful you know?
You gotta keep your eyes
on the ball.
Two o'clock in the morning,
it's dark, your mind's a little agitated.
You're driving a little too fast.
Those curves
don't kid around.
Could've happened
to anybody, I mean...
I didn't know Jenny to be reckless
but you know, she'd have a drink here
and smoke a little pot and that was it.
Nottin' more than that.
No, not my girl.
Self-control, she had.
It was a point of pride.
Where'd she get it?
This grass or whatever.
Oh, no. Look, I am no drug dealer man.
What do you think?
I think you didn't get that ink
in the navy doing your National Service.
Hey man. I already told you man.
Corcoran, you know.
You know what that is?
State prison.
I did my time okay? My sister, her man
is in Chino right now, doin' eight years.
I go to work.
I put my life together.
Put all that shit behind me.
Five years in the joint!
That's it!
I just got out meself,
didn't I?
This bloke
she was bunked up with,
- Terry Whatsit...
- Terry Valentine.
What's he got to say
for himself?
I dunno.
What he gonna say?
They had a fight,
she drove away. She was upset.
Couple of weeks
before Jenny died,
she asked me
to drive her downtown.
She said she wanted to talk
to her boyfriend, Valentine.
But I think
she was looking for him.
To catch him
with another bird?
Exactly,
that's what I thought,
but we didn't go to no hotel
or nottin like that.
- We went someplace else. -
Whereabouts?
Some bad place,
bad people.
Some guy unloading trucks.
Some kind of deal going down.
I dunno and I don't care, OK?
They could've been shipping
fava beans to Eskimos.'
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't there, so...
if he was involved,
or she was into something, who's to say?
But I wanna tell you...
Jenny stood
right in front of those guys,
eyeballing them,
checking them out.
She made me feel like
she was covering MY ass.
I can't even believe that.
Really?
What'd she say?
Hang on.
Can I help you?
You can't be
too careful nowadays, you know.
Lot of tea leaves about.
You know what I mean?
Excuse me?
Tea leaves. Thieves.
Terry Valentine. D'you know him?
And... who are you?
Wilson. My name's Wilson.
Well, Wilson, to start...
I never heard of you.
Well, I'm not that well known.
Except round certain districts,
some police nicks, you know?
Police what?
Who? Me? No.
Can't be bothered.
Hey hey hey hey.
Who.. Who the fuck are you?
And how did you get in here?
Only a little bird
told me
that you and Terry Valentine
have business dealings...
I don't know anybody
named Terry Valentine.
- Don't you?
- Now, you take a walk, pal. Okay.
You're making a big mistake.
Come on. Get the hell out of here.
Hey!
What you been up to, pal?
What you been doing, son?
You got to buck your ideas up.
What you been doing?
Jennifer Wilson.
Jennifer Wilson.
That name mean anything?
Alright, what's the deal here?
Hold on. What the hell...
Who is this guy?
The only reason
you're not dead
is I want to find out
who the fuck you are.
Jennifer... Wilson
was my daughter.
Who the fuck is Jennifer...
Wasn't she the chick
that showed up down here?
Yeah, talked the same way
as this cocksucker.
Terry Valentine
is a friend of mine.
He's a personal friend of mine. I don't
talk about my friends with strangers.
But that cunt daughter of yours,
she come up here,
sticking her tits in my face.
Who am I? How do I know Terry?
What's the nature
of our business together?
I admire Terry for a lot of things, but I
gotta say,
he Ehh.. he let himself get..
Ehh... royally pussy-whipped
by that fucking bitch.
You know what I would
like to have done to her?
You know what I would
like to have done?
I bet she
would've like that huh?
It's too bad she had to take
a nosedive off that cliff.
Probably dried her all up.
Got him right here!
Get him outta here.
You want me to.. call an ambulance?
<i>- No!</i>
Call Avery.
Go, man!
Just get outta here.
Come on!
Now, you come back here again, Pop,
and we'll kill you.
You understand?
This is private property.
We will shoot you, fuck-o.
Do you get it?!
Fuckin' old fart coming here.
BIG, dangerous gun!
Yeah. We're quakin'!
We're quakin'!
Yeah. Shit!
Hey, you come on back,
you come on back and visit and trespass ok?
We look forward to it, asshole.
Stupid English fuck!
Hey! What.. Wait!
<i>Hey!</i>
What the...
You tell him!
You tell him I'm coming.
Tell him I'm fucking coming!
Tell 'em I'm coming?
"Tell <i>him</i> I'm coming."
Who?
Nobody knows.
<i>If you could only see me</i>
<i>I know exactly where I am</i>
<i>You wouldn't want to be me</i>
<i>Oh, I can assure you of that</i>
<i>I'm not the guy to run with</i>
<i>Cos I'll throw you
off the line</i>
<i>I'll break you
and destroy you</i>
<i>Given time</i>
<i>He's King Midas with a curse</i>
<i>He's King Midas in reverse</i>
<i>He's King Midas with a curse</i>
<i>He's King Midas in reverse</i>
<i>It's plain to see
It's hopeless</i>
Adhara.
I remember telling your parents,
if you're looking for a name,
you can't go wrong
with a constellation.
Well, I used to hate it.
Now I like it.
Well, it could be worse.
They could have called you...
Reticulum, Pleiades.
God, you're beautiful.
Is there anything
in this world you want or need?
Well, I want to know why you need
that scary man in your house.
Gordon?
He's been with me for years.
He's not as tough as he looks.
Then what good is he?
- Heard of loyalty?
Yeah... I'm loyal to things
that make me happy.
Oh, am I a "thing"?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
- I'm not?
- No.
You're not specific enough
to be a person.
You're more like Ehm..
A vibe.
God, I'm glad we're having
this little chat. Come here.
Get out of the pool.
Terry.
Look, I don't know
what transpired exactly.
What?
Our friends downtown.
Someone took them out.
Took them out?
What the fuck does that mean?
Well, it used to mean
it was similar to a gangland slaying.
Maybe it still is.
- Well... well, who?
Well...
- Blacks?
Blacks? No Terry,
it's not their style.
No, from what I gather it was a..
It was a lone gunman.
Lone gunman?
Oh Jesus..
You sound like the 5 o'clock news.
Why are you telling me all this shit?
Well, as long as you don't known about it..
I didn't want you to hear about it
and then freak out.
Fuck you, Jim.
I don't freak out any more.
Oh..
Well, it's.. it's probably nothing.
It's usually what senseless mayhem
comes down to, isn't it?
Bad loan, bad judgment,
bad faith.
These were bad people,
involved with worse people.
Cops got a lot of leads to follow, so..
It's great. Great, as long as nobody
can connect anything to me.
No, no, no no.
No one's gonna connect anything to you.
That was a one-off deal,
like a moving freight train.
You hopped on, you hopped off.
Anything else,
I would've had you walk away.
You never saw those
guys again, right?
Are you crazy?
They're your friends,
not mine.
What?
Your "clients"?
I befriended them
when you needed them.
Let's put it that way.
Well, the cops.
I mean, you know, I'm...
Are they satisfied with this...
gangland shit, or what?
You know the cops don't get
satisfied. They get placated.
They're already talking
to the kid who got away.
You know the kid? Yeah!
The kid who called me.
Well, I called them...
Scared out of his wits, this kid.
All he can say is..
That the shooter is some crazy guy.
"Shooter"?
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, he said.. he said
he went nuts.
He was yelling and screaming about..
"Tell him I'm coming."
"Tell 'em I'm coming?"
"Tell <i>him</i> I'm coming."
Who?
Nobody knows.
Oh man, great. This is sure
making the fuck out of my day.
Oh. Come on, come on.
Terry, relax,
would you, please.
Look. The goods are long gone.
Money's been turned around.
Middlemen are dead.
This is a good thing, huh?
So, don't panic, Ok?
No one can link
anybody to you.
Jenny did.
Yeah, well,
Jenny could.
She'd already got to you.
Terry Valentine...
D'you know him?
Look, Valentine came into
the restaurant a couple of times, right?
The guy is a money guy.
They were together
how long?
Five years.
A long time.
There you go.
Jenny must've liked him.
Jenny would say,
"Hey. Here's my friend Eddie."
He'd shake my hand and
everything
but the guy wouldn't even see me,
you know what I mean?
Jenny met him at a beach.
Got blinded by his smile.
Can you believe that shit man?
That son of a bitch never smiled at me.
I mean.. Jenny and I were friends,
but you know, we didn't travel in the
same social circles, you know?
She had her life.
I had mine.
How'd you..
How'd you two hook up then?
Oh.. Jenny was
in my acting class.
She was 21
when she came to me.
Straight from leaving you.
You know maybe you should talk to Elaine.
That was her best friend.
I do double duty
as a voice coach.
Not that her accent
would've hobbled her progress.
Not with that look.
She didn't write me,
did she?
She didn't
know what to say.
I mean.. I figured somebody
should say something to someone, you know?
You're Jenny's father.
Why did you come here?
Thought it'd be nice to have
a chat with you, that's all.
No...
No.
Why did you come here?
Get a few things
sorted out.
Been busy, have you?
How do you mean?
I heard you were eh...
What is that adorable
expression...
at Her Majesty's pleasure.
It was the bars, then.
What was it, uh,
Wembley Stadium job?
That was it, right?
Pink Floyd concert receipts.
Earning interest
in an offshore account.
Tidy little premium
per annum, that.
Security like that
can't be bought.
Must be more comforting than
having a daughter to greet you.
Oi, ain't you gonna
let me in?
You can call me again.
Weren't you in a soap
on the box?
Three Seasons.
Who told you that? Eddie?
Yeah, Eddie. Yeah.
He's my new china.
- Ch... What?
- China plate, mate. Me and him.
Quite a character,
isn't he?
I mean, not to you of course.
To us squares in the outside world.
He give me your address.
I gave him yours.
I guess I thought I was
being loyal to Jenny,
who told me
she didn't have a father.
Before, of course,
proceeding to tell me why.
Yeah... Well...
She was right in a way.
Her mum died when she was six.
After that she was on her own.
Aunts and uncles and then, well...
How are you gonna keep her down on
the farm after she's seen L.A.?
They.. they give me compassionate leave
from Parkhurst
to visit her in the hospital.
Cos we was always mates,
Jenny's mum and me.
I like to think
they're together now, you know?
Heavenly choir.
And that's where
you got the word?
That's where Eddie wrote you,
in prison?
Oh, no, no. I knew.
I knew before Ed.
Uh...
What time was it
supposed to have happened?
Eddie said...
two in the morning.
Well, that's like eight
hours difference
between here and London,
that would have made
it about like...
ten o'clock..
My time.
I was just going out
in the yard.
I was in the habit of saving
my newspaper till then, you know?
Stretch me legs,
breath of fresh air,
bit of a read,
stretch out the good part
of the day, as it were.
And..
I couldn't open the newspaper.
It was like the pages
was glued together.
Me hands were that weak.
I thought I was havin'
a heart attack.
Course I know I wasn't.
Guy I knew come up.
"Here, Wilson", he said,
"You're as white as a sheet."
I said, "Well.. Fuck me".
I've been in prison half
me life, haven't I?"
But like he was dead-on.
Because I'd felt all the
blood drain out of me head.
And I knew...
I knew something
must've happened to Jen.
She was...
magic.
I can't believe Jenny
told you all that about me.
She was always
so embarrassed.
Not embarrassed.
Ashamed?
Not ashamed.
Disappointed.
Do you even know
who Terry Valentine is?
Some.. pop music producer,
isn't he?
Rock and roll
is we call it.
Kind of a promoter,
I guess.
Whatever that means.
Anyway, he took the whole
'60s Southern California
zeitgeist and ran with it.
Packaged and sold it.
Made out like a bandit.
What's the deal?
Hm?
You and Terry Valentine
at 20 paces? Come on.
Is that it?
I don't see why not.
Are you serious?
Have you ever known me
not to be?
Oh, you fucking guys
and your dicks, man.
What do you expect me to do?
Stay at home doing sweet F.A.?
You don't believe
it was a car accident?
Oh, yeah!
She fell asleep
at the wheel!
Terry is never gonna give
you that satisfaction.
He is <i>not</i> the type.
Depends, dunnit?
On what?
What makes you so certain?
I bloody ask 'im.
Fine.
There's the phone.
Want his number?
I've got his number!
Whatever you gotta do, man.
Better go do it.
Looks like he's brought in
the 'eavy mob.
- You're kidding me?
- Extra muscle. Bodyguards.
They look a right load of
wallies though.
You should see 'em.
Patrolling up and down
in front of the house.
Let me see let me see.
All done up
like the fucking household cavalry.
Those are valets, man.
Valets? What do
you mean, valets?
Who does he think he is?
The Marquess
of fuckin' Tavistock?
Valets, man, Valets.
They park cars you know?
They're having a
party it looks like.
Aye.
Thank you.
Oi! Trousers, keep it 'Andy.
We're not gonna be staying long.
- Yes, sir.
- Vengo ahora.
Boy, we're a little early, huh?
Well, first in, first out.
That's me.
Good evening.
Mind how you go.
Gentlemen,
what can I get you?
Babycham.
Eduardo...
Do you want it
with a twist?
Tomato juice
with Tabasco.
I'll have a coke.
You have
the same posters.
What?
That you have down at your office.
No, they're different.
Well, I like the colours.
We all did.
Hmm.
Must have been a time, huh?
A golden moment.
Have you ever dreamed
about a place...
you never really
recalled being to before?
A place that.. maybe only exists
in your imagination?
Some place far away,
half-remembered
when you wake up.
When you were there, though,
you knew the language.
You knew your way around.
That was the '60s.
No.
It wasn't that, either.
It was just '66
and early '67.
That's all it was.
I'm gonna have a butcher's
round the house.
Who you gonna butcher?
Butcher's hook, 'look'.
Butcher's...
Mm, try one of these.
No, I don't like that.
Try one of these.
Hi.
Hey Terry. How you doing?
- Great, how you doing?
- Very well, thank you.
- Good to see you.
Our.. our counterfeit CD's
are doing extraordinarily well...
Do I know you?
It was supposed to be an infinity
pool and go off the edge.
- Definitely business affairs.
- Terry Valentine.
- Good to see you.
Nice to meet you.
Shit.
Hello?
Hey.
No no, it's Crestview Terrace,
not Crestview Place.
Yeah. No, there's three
different ways up the hill.
The best way
is to take Loma Vista.
Loma Lin...
Loma Linda.
Yeah.
Yes.
OK. Alright, bye.
Hi, how you doing?
Good to see you.
Hi!
- Well, you know...
- Unbelievable.
It's the record business.
What can you say?
Oh It's the 'how-are-you' crowd.
- The 'how-are-you' crowd...
There you are.
- Well, you know Jim.
- Of course. We know we know.
Blimey!
Yeah. If you can afford a house like this
you buy a house like this you know?
What are we standing on?
Trust.
You know..
you could see the sea out there
if you could see it.
Could yer?
Mm.
Where are you going?
Hello?
The pool's hot, too,
if you want to.
Well, you know...
No no no, we're not
doing this.
...produced the first
Christopher Cross album?
Come on,
come on.
What was he like, huh?
Just give me a little bit, a nugget.
- I just do the contracts.
- That's it?
- Yeah, just the contracts.
Bring the motor round.
Bang out front.
Oi!
Point it downhill.
Well, as I was driving it down Melrose,
taking a left on Seward,
I saw this little guy locking up a car,
it was so unmarked it was marked.
I mean it was just, w...
Down there? There's a guy down there.
- Call the police.
No, no.
Dame la llave,
gracias, gracias.
Eh.. Excuse me.
Can I help you?
Ahh!
Go, go.
Are you OK?
Steady on, Fangio.
Man, you steady on, man!
What the fuck you do back there?
You didn't cap the guy,
did you?
Did you?
That would have been too easy.
Too easy?
He's gotta know why.
You think a fucking guy like that
ever will?
Down!
- Whoa!
Whoa!
Fuck!
Wilson, Wilson! Wilson!
Wilson! Come on, man!
Come on, come on, come on.
Shit!
Shit.
Wilson.
Oh, boy.
You should have let <i>me</i>
do the talking.
Why? Cos you're my
security consultant?
What's the fuck is going on?
What did you tell them?
I told that a long time employee
flipped out.
That he had drug problems,
and he refused counseling...
which as it happens is true...
And he..
committed suicide.
One of the guests
tried to stop him.
Jim, how the fuck do you stop
Gordon at 400 pounds?
That was good, that was good.
Good.
He's heavier than that now, isn't he?
- Oh!
Now, Jenny never told you
about her dad.
Oh, her dad,
what dad?
The one that was in
prison nine years.
Gets released last month.
Jenny's father was in prison?
For what?
Armed robbery. Again.
Oh again? Oh, my God.
Yeah, he's a career criminal Terry.
He's on leave of absence. Get it?
Oh. Where are you going?
Don't you think I oughta find him
before they do?
Oh, man.
I am fucking screwed.
I'm screwed to the wall!
Look. I don't suppose that he entered
the country under his own name.
Oh, give me a
fucking break, man.
Can you do that?
Well, I would if I came
this far to kill someone.
Oh, man.
OK.
Not even one of your
guys should handle this.
Well, what do you want me
to do?
Tell them?
No, I mean...
I told them I didn't know
who the guy was.
People come, people go.
How the fuck are you
gonna find him?
Terry.
He's not James Bond, you know?
This is some pathetic sad sack wandering...
- You tell that to Gordon.
What's England anyway? Some rinky-dink
country half the size of Wyoming
where the cops
don't even carry guns?
I don't know man.
This is getting all too close to me.
What, you know something Terry?
People close to you
keep falling into canyons.
Oh, well now,
that's brilliant.
Hey, relax.
I have other resources.
I have other resources.
No-one even
near to me
because I am out of here.
I'm gone.
How you keep getting
so lucky, Terry?
I learned how to skate
when I was a little boy.
Well, you know...
You have a dozen interventions
if a person doesn't wanna face up to it.
I guess not.
All the people in the music industry have
been taken down by doing too many...
...many...
...drugs.
Alright. Straight rotation,
no bullshit, you call your shots.
You're scratching the eight, you lose.
Sound good?
Yeah. It's good.
Let me break, right?
- Yeah, break 'em up.
He broke last time.
What did you say?
I say he broke last time.
So what man. Look at him.
He loves to break.
Look, he's all excited.
I see that he's excited.
I don't give a shit if he
likes to break or not.
This is.. It's my break.
I'm not babysitting this guy.
I won the break.
I won the break!
- What's the fuck is that?
I'm s.. I'm just kiddin'.
Are these your quarters over here?
- Yeah.
What the fuck is this guy doin'?
I dunno.
What the fuck's goin' on man?
Why don't you go fuck yourself man,
and take Mr Goodwrench with you.
You know what man? I'd tell you
to blow it out your arse
but my dick's in the way.
So...
Oh-oh. Did I cross the line?
Does that mean you forfeit?
Just wanted to play a fucking game.
- Stacy!
Come over here.
How's it going, kid?
Not bad.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
- OK.
Same as last time.
The rest after.
Where do we go?
When you find the guy
you'll know.
What shit is this man?
I just do it you know. I don't organize it.
Look, I can point
you in the right direction
but you've gotta take
it in to the end zone.
Cause Bob's a hit-and-run gunman.
I figure he's not cruisin'
the polo lounge.
This is un-fucking-professional, man.
Oh?
Well, you see a successful man
like me has limitations.
I lose touch with the
street level so...
I have to depend on a
smart boy like you.
You're a lot closer
to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Fuck you, mister,
whatever your name is, all right?
This is a lifestyle
I embrace.
That's why I'm letting you
take care of this.
You see, I'm the one
with appearances to maintain.
But who gives a shit about you?
Not even God.
Get it done.
Get a tie.
How much?
- Five grand.
- Hey!
Got half in my pocket.
- Making trouble for someone?
- Yup.
Which kind?
The forever kind.
Maybe she doesn't even know
the English dude.
I don't know. A.. Avery said
she was tight with the guy's daughter.
That don't mean nothin'.
She's nice lookin'.
So what?
I dunno. I just said
she's nice lookin'.
And I said, "So what"?
Think she's any happier?
What do you mean
"Any happier"?
Any happier than any other
asshole in this life.
I dunno,
I never met her.
Why don't they make
shows about people's daily lives
you'd be interested
in watching you know like...
sick old man or skinny
little weakling you know.
Big fat guy? Wouldn't you watch a show
called 'Big Fat Guy'?
I'd watch that fucking show.
Extras, excuse me,
'background artists', right?
"Hey"!
"Hey, Mom and Dad. How's it
goin'? Yeah, Hollywood's great."
"Yes, still a loser."
I wonder what
it's like to have tits.
Jesus, are you gay enough, or what?
"Hello, Studio City."
Fag.
Look at this guy.
Oh yeah, they need that right away.
What's the smartest thing that ever came
out of a woman's mouth?
Einstein's cock.
That little kid's kinda cute, though.
Know what I mean?
Okay, she's a little young, but...
You wanna run
with me now?
Did you forget your words?
John, I got him.
Step aside, ma'am.
Come with us.
Wasn't half crowded
in the back of that car, wasn't it?
Drug enforcement?
Narcs?
God!
I don't suppose you'd prefer
a steady income? Mmh?
I've got a steady income.
I'm on the dole.
A leech on the welfare state
in addition.
You don't miss a trick.
Just a fiddle.
They got me down
as an immigrant with five kids.
Uhuh, yeah.
Jenny spoke fondly of
her imaginary siblings.
Do you even remember
the last time you saw her?
I remember every time
I saw her.
I watched her grow up.
In increments.
She told me
you were a ghost in her life.
Daddy, the friendly ghost.
Well, she twigged by the time
she was eight or nine
I wasn't in the Royal Marines or...
playing lago
in a world tour of Othello.
Freedom is a word I rarely use
When I'm thinking...
When I'm thinking...
Of the time
Of the time
When I've been loved
She was always
threatening me.
Can you imagine?
"If you're naughty, Dad,
I'll put the law
on yer, promise."
She didn't want me
to get sent down again, see?
And if she got wind
that I was planning something,
"I'll shop yer, Dad.
I promise, I'll shop yer."
I can see her
picking up the phone.
"Look, Dad. I'm calling
the Old Bill right now."
It became a sort
of joke between us, only...
it wasn't really.
She never would've
turned you in.
Not in a million years.
Oh, I know that.
But as time went on, well...
when, in ever decreasing circles,
the joke wore off.
She had a feeling
'bout this last job.
How long I'd get
banged up for.
Said she wouldn't be
around this time
when I got out.
And.. she wasn't.
How you doin' then?
All right, are ya?
Now look, squire.
You're the guv'nor
'ere, I can see that.
I'm on your manor now.
So there’s no need to get
your knickers in a twist.
Whatever this bollocks is,
that's going down between
you and that slave Valentine,
it's got nothin' to do with me.
I couldn't care less, alright mate?
Let me explain yer.
When I was in prison,
second time
Er, no, tell a lie,
third stretch. Yep, third.
Third...
There was this screw
what really had it in for me.
And that geezer
was top of my list.
Two years after I got sprung I sees
'im in Holland Park.
He's sitting on a bench feeding
bloody pigeons.
There was no one about.
I could have gone up behind him
and snapped his fucking neck.
Wallop. But I left it.
I could have knobled 'im,
but I didn't.
Cause what I thought I wanted,
wasn't what I wanted.
What I thought I was thinkin' about
was something else.
I didn't give a toss.
It didn't matter, see?
This berk on the bench
wasn't worth my time.
It meant sod all in the end.
Cause you gotta make a choice.
When to do something
and when to let it go.
When it matters,
and when it don't.
Bide yer time.
That's what prison
teaches if nothing else.
Bide yer time
and everything becomes clear.
And you can act accordingly.
There's one thing
I don't understand.
The thing I don't understand is
every mother fuckin' word you're saying.
Do you know what I reckon?
You and I are after
the same thing
but for different reasons.
And what would that be?
- The reasons?
Start with the thing.
I would has it a guess
that whatever you're after involves a
considerable sum of money.
And that's not what
lights your fire?
In the past, granted.
I have been known to redistribute wealth.
But no...
I'm after another kind of..
satisfaction.
Do you know what I mean?
You're not from around here,
are you?
You're not carrying
any kind of ID.
Who me? ID? No no.
When your chaps went
through my pockets,
there was nothing there.
What's your connection
to Terry Valentine?
My daughter...
was living with 'im
when she died.
I imagine about the same time
as whatever the deal was,
that Terry Valentine grafted
you out of your share of.
When I say grafted...
- You think...
Terry Valentine screwed me
out of some deal?
It wouldn't surprise me.
I mean, he's about as
straight as a dog's hind leg.
What could this deal have been,
I wonder,
to have set in motion such
an unfortunate chain of events.
Could've been anything.
Shit load of heroin imported
from somewhere or other.
The usual scumbags involved.
But you know 'the thing
about scumbags is...
no matter what they do with the
drugs, the harder thing to move
is the money.
The money.
In my line of work the best
thing to do is follow the money,
because you can't hide the money.
You can only disguise it.
So what do you do?
You find some rich fool
to bank all the cash coming in.
Make it look legitimate
in exchange for..
skimming a percentage off the top.
Maybe as much as a million
dollars commission.
Rich fool, who overextended
himself over time,
in danger of not being
so rich any more.
But I can't be sure.
Can't prove anything.
Anything at all.
What was your daughter's
involvement?
That's what I wanna know.
I was hoping you might...
The security guard
that works for Valentine?
He's the one who sent
those creeps after you.
I shouldn't wonder.
Yeah, must've done.
He's kind of a slippery fellow.
But he keeps his hands clean
and Valentine's.
Darn it,
there go my...
slippery hands again.
There was an incident in downtown
Los Angeles a couple of days ago
that may have spurred this...
most recent activity.
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, right?
Thank you.
Your daughter, she had
a fondness for dangerous men?
Shame about the money, though.
Going into Valentine's pocket
and not yours.
I don't give a shit
about the money.
Personally..
I prefer the heroin.
See, crooks move faster
than the system,
so if we're gonna clean up
the neighbourhood,
we don't have time to
wait for things like..
search warrants and trials.
Procedure becomes
whatever you gotta do...
on the day.
Uh-huh.
Er, cheers mate.
Go with God.
Yeah.
<i>I like to dream</i>
<i>Yes, Yes

I was coming back from a motorcycle classic
in a place called Sturgis, South Dakota,
on my eh.. motorcycle,
on US Highway 14.
Just side of Spotted Horse.
I ran into a deer, I hit a deer.
I had no chance.
Even though the highway patrol had Ehh..
highway people had mowed the sides,
where the culverts were
they couldn't mow
and this doe just jumped
right in front of the bike.
I had a chance to say one word.
It was "Fuck" and I hit it.
I know this:
If the bullets come in my way and I see
my name on it,
I won't be calling for my mother!
But man, I'll tell ya, the only reason
I'm alive and telling the story now
is due to the big FL front end,
and that solid Tyre on my Fat Boy.
- Oh, your Fat Boy.
Yeah, exactly. I was wearing the Fat Boy.
I saw the ground and I thought
"Mm, put it down."
And I just rode the bike
down into the ground.
Did perfect...
You've told me this story before.
- Did I really?
- Yeah, you did.
I'm sorry.
But I'll hear it again if you want.
Oh, you're sweet.
God, you are wonderful.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
It must be hard to pass
on this road, huh?
Oh, the freeway's faster
but it lacks a certain majesty.
It's just the car behind us
has been following for a while.
I sure hope so.
Where is Big Sur?
Up the coast.
How far?
I don't know.
Uh, a few hours, I guess. Why?
That's where
he's scarpered.
- How do you know?
Bloke told me.
You shouldn't go back
to your place.
Not till this is settled.
What's
a sliding scale?
A sliding scale?
Well, a sliding scale.. um...
If we were in a union
we'd all make different rates
based on the time we served.
So eh...
so, he's been...
That's not a sliding scale.
What do you mean?
- That's not a sliding scale
Well, what's
a sliding scale?
A sliding scale is...
The scale, you know, you start off
somewhere.
And you move up.
Or you move down.
That's a sliding scale.
He doesn't know what
a sliding scale is.
You move down?
Dog shit cues man.
I swear I could get
a branch off a tree outside
straighter than this thing.
Stacy!
Go ahead man, break 'em up.
Yeah.
I just got chewed out.
Fucking believe that?
What does he want from us?
- That's what I said:
What the fuck do you want
us to do, you know?
You didn't tell us there were gonna be all
these Negroes following the guy 'round too.
Something's on, man.
What?
Well, let's just say I happen know to a little
more about Mister whats-his-name.. Avery
than he thinks I do
about him and his 'operation'.
Say man, I got a
guy on the inside.
Who's that?
Know that putz,
Tom, from Seattle?
Tom... Tom Johanssen?
Yeah, from Seattle.
- I sent him to Avery.
What did he say?
he say they're taking a road-trip
up the coast you know.
Him, Avery, a couple of guys.
You think we oughta hit
this English guy again or what?
Yeah man. Yeah. If he hasn't gotten whacked
in buck town we might still have our aces.
I just can't fucking figure out
who this guy is, you know?
A courier.
A buyer. Seller.
Anyway...
Avery wants him.
Those jigs wanted him.
You can bet your ass
there's a briefcase somewhere.
A briefcase.
So whatta ya think's in it?
Drugs, cash, what ever.
Both if we're lucky you know?
And while they're all
fucking each other over
a couple of parties like
us could move right in.
<i>Like a sudden ray

Hey, can I ask
you a question?
Another one?
Yeah. Like, you.. you have
any friends, man?
Yeah.
Could call 'em that, I suppose.
Yeah.
Down the boozer,
Saturday night. Meet the chaps.
Friends
and colleagues.
A lot of 'em are gone.
The old faces.
Dunno where.
Different characters nowadays.
Different assumptions.
You don't know
where you are.
The last load
of friends I had...
Well...
it turned out they weren't
my friends after all.
Hey Elaine.
Do you ever even understand
half the shit this guy say?
No, but I know
what he means.
You know, I should be in Paris
or Kurdistan.
No, he'd find you
in Kurdistan.
Why don't you try London?
He has a history of being
apprehended there.
You're a font
of optimism.
What the hell else have your
little techies come up with?
Terry, we're trying
to hunt him down.
We have my foot-soldiers out there.
What more can I do?
And if he
comes here?
And, what
if he does?
Yeah.
So, you don't want
to tell me about this?
About being here
with the bodyguards
and everything.
I don't suppose you've
ever had any...
anything like enemies.
Well, I never went out
for the cheerleading squad,
and I never stole anyone's
boyfriend that I know of.
So no.
I'd like to think not.
You never will.
Well, come on now.
I don't want anybody
limiting my possibilities.
That won't happen either.
This is...
This is just a precaution.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to..
to drag you along.
I.. I...
I needed you to,
um...
I just don't...
You don't want
to be alone?
You see? You...
You understand that
about me already.
Where is she?
Terry... scattered
her ashes from a boat.
Buries her at a private service.
Private for who? Him? Shit!
Jenny lived at the beach
when she moved here.
She loved the ocean.
She was from an island.
Shit!
<i>George Clooney comes to Venice

Check the news.
Check the news.
- Where's the remote?
- I dunno.
Fuck.
Where the hell is Rick?
Hm?
Shut off all the inside lights.
I'll get Adhara.
Stay away
from the windows.
Hey!
You heard of knocking?
Look, I need you to come with me.
Why? What's going on?
- Please, now.
- Look, you see that?
- What?
That shadow.
I don't see it.
I thought I told you
to stay away from the window.
Come on, everybody. In here.
Behind the counter.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Behind the counter. Quick.
Terry.
Okay.
What is going on here?
We think somebody's here.
- What? We think?!
We can't find Rick and...
- <i>Larry!</i>
Someone call the cops.
- No!
Why not?
Because I'm taking care of it.
You guys are fucking nuts.
I'm calling the cops.
No!
Mr Avery...
Watch my back.
Son of a bitch.
Aahhh!
- Pow!
- What is it?
I think Avery's down.
Fuck this.
Arh!
Ah!
Don't!
I'm a friend of Stacy's.
Heh!
Fuck you, Tom.
Oh! Shit.
Stay.
- What?
Wh..
Where are you going?
Jesus.
Tell me.
Tell me about Jenny!
Tell me about Jenny.
Tell me about Jenny!
I needed money.
I would have given her
anything she wanted.
But she..
She found out
about my deal.
She tried to stop me.
She said she was gonna
turn me in.
She said she was gonna
call the cops.
I couldn't stop it.
It already happened.
It was over.
She was going to call the cops.
She meant it.
She had the phone
in her hand.
She was gonna
call the cops.
She meant it.
I couldn't stop it.
I couldn't do anything.
Ta.
You're English.
Yeah, that's right.
I can never decide
what I like better.
Leaving home
or coming back.
I prefer
stayin 'ome, me.
Oh, so you're
a reluctant traveler?
Got called out
to LA unexpected-like.
Do a job of work.
No rest for the wicked.
Been away a lot.
Where else?
Out on a an oil rig
in the North Sea.
Nine years.
Nine years? Wow.
Is that legal?
Well...
Time off for good behaviour.
I shouldn't
have even been there.
It was these other lads
what should have been
there in my place.
And then just when
I finish me nine years...
me contract.
Wallop.
I had to bugger off
to the States.
Well, it sounds like
you need a rest.
Yeah, could be.
Freedom is a word
I rarely use.
Without thinking
mm-hm
Without thinking
uh-huh
Of the time
Of the time
When I was loved
That was very good.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Gettin' better, ain't I?
- You are.
Ohh...
