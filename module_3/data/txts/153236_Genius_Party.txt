A snack? Want to buy a snack?
Hey, hot buns for sale!
You just want two? Sure! I'll bag them up...
Gongrong!
Hey, Gongrong! You're at it again!
I'm going to tell Teacher.
Eh, but I like it...
Hey, you little shit!
Little shit! Little shit! Little shit!
You guys!
Stop it!
Damn it...
Eh? You've got a problem?
Got a problem!! Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem!
Got a problem! Got a problem!! Got a problem!
Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem!
Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem!
Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem! Got a problem!
Stop that, you guys!
Hey! Stop messing around!
Oh, Meihua, so you actually like Gongrong!
Meihua likes Gongrong,, Meihua likes Gongrong...
Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong,
Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong...
Meihua likes Gongrong,, Meihua likes Gongrong...
Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong,
Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong, Meihua likes Gongrong...
What?
Hey, stop kidding around! Who likes Gongrong?
When Teacher gets back, we'll definitely get scolded.
It's huge...
Wow, what exactly is in there?
Gongrong, be careful!
Where is it...
What did he pick up?
Yeah, what?
What is this?
Gongrong, let me see it!
It might be a little dangerous.
It looks strange...
Look at that!
What is it?!
Amazing...
How'd that happen?
D-Don't eat it!
It's really good!
Operation of the Thought Materialization System confirmed.
It's functioning?
Is there really a human who can operate the System there?
If the System and the operator are seized by the AI forces, our fate is sealed...
We have to hurry!
Hey! Get out of the way!
Move!
Meihua, be careful!
It's pretty tasty!
Here, give that to me!
It's mine!
It's sparkling.
Give it back!
Hey, give it back!
Give it back!
Give...back!
Give... it...
Give... it... back!
Give it100}
Give...
Give... it...
Kids, it's dangerous! Get back in!
Watch out!
Run!
Gongrong!
System registrant confirmed.
Biological age, 5 to 6 years,
determined to be a human child.
Could this boy...
be the legendary child?
I am a member of the Spacetime Patrol Force, Krein Schmer.
I request your cooperation.
Huh...?
Don't listen to him!
Doesn't Teacher always say to never listen to strangers?
What did you say?
That System is the prototype of an epochal spacetime-creation system that materializes the ideas of humans.
And you are the first to break past the critical point of this system and succeed in operating it.
All that can save us from destruction, from this crisis, is this System,
and no one else but you!
Is anything I'm saying getting through to you?
What's all this chaos?!
This way!
Gongrong!
I'll leave it to you, Sai!
Thief!
Come back alive!
Watch out!
It's floating!
They're catching up!
Cover your ears!
Awesome...
Look ahead!
Wow, Meihua, that was a nice move!
- Are you okay?
- Ouch...

Stay still!
Idiots!
Sai!
Sai!
A kid like this can't be the one who'll protect our future!
- Save me!
- 「救命啊!」

- Trans...form!
- 「变...身!」

- I am the warrior of justice!
- 「我是正义战士!」

- Watch this, criminal!
- 「阿统，看招吧!」

Trans...
Trans... form!
I am the warrior of justice!
Watch this, criminal!
What?!
This is...
Gongrong, behind you!
Amazing...
Gongrong, that was so cool!
It's so big...
I'll stop it!
Wait! That's the...!
Gongrong!
Ultra Divine Wave!
Take this!
Ultra Divine Lightning Sword!
Watch this!
One more time!
Are you okay?
My warrior suit...
Crap!
Draw the most powerful thing you can think of!
Oh no! I already used my most powerful move just now, the Ultra Divine Lightning. It's the strongest...
Then make a missile!
What's a mis...sile?
Hurry!
How irritating!
Hey, what are you doing?
All right... This should be fine.
Where did you come from?
From a star in that direction.
But... I don't see any stars there.
Not right now, no.
It might be a bit hard for you two to grasp, but...
The Earth of 300 years in the future is over there, you see.
The future?
The Earth and the Sun are both traveling through the galaxy at a tremendous speed of 217 kilometers a second,
heading towards Lyra.
So, 300 years in the future, our Earth is there.
And 300 years from now, humanity will become too reliant on biotechnology and AI,
and will lose its ability to reproduce.
Children will become a rare sight.
What?
Therefore, in search of the imaginative power of children like you, we came to this era.
Let's go!
Wow! It's beautiful!
It's great!
Oh, appreciate it...
Thank you!
Are you all ready?
Gongrong, I'm still a little scared...
Don't worry!
Ready...go!
Ready... Off we go!
Are you still asleep? You'll be late for school.
Cut it out.
Stop playing dead, I know you are.
Unfuk is already up!
Oops...
There, good as new.
Eat up! Your favorite breakfast.
We got some really nice worms today.
Wow! Great!
But I hate worms.
Hurry up or you you'll miss the school bus.
It's been one month since we came here and you still haven't made any friends?
I fit in with this world perfectly. My body stinks like everybody.
OK, OK. I'm going.
The sky looks strange.
You stink.
Can I touch you?
Can I lick you ?
What's that?
You don't know anything! It's an Uzu Uzu.
Wow! An Uzu Uzu!
Cool!
It's super dangerous.
Only appears once a year.
Yeah?
Can I eat you?
Help!!!
Not again.
He's digging in.
Zombies are best when made 50 days post-mortem.
The embalming compound must be rubbed in thoroughly...
I smell something alive.
You may have noticed there is an Uzu Uzu out today.
You have to be careful.
Hey! Where'd he go?
So you guys are heroes?
Yep, yep.
Ashe fights off enemies with fire?
Wow.
Blaze can manipulate water?
Yep.
Cool. You guys rock.
What can you do, Posse?
Take this off...
And I'm super-zombie!
Wow, Posse!
Hurry up. How'd he get in?
Who are they?
You mean us? Blaze and... I'm Ashe.
You got a problem?
You're not what I expected, that's all.
What do you mean?
We were just out conquering evil after school.
Gross! He squirted water on me.
Get lost, you fire breathing loser!
And that's how we conquered evil.
OK?
OK. I wanted to ask you heroes a favor.
A favor?
Yeah. It's this...
Whoa! It's alive! A living frog!
My tummy. I'm gonna blow...
A live frog? Are you nuts?
I thought I was gonna die!
I want to return him to his home.
What? That's impossible.
But Posse said you two could do it.
No way. We'll be busted by the zombie police.
Although I've never seen one.
It's not impossible.
In the Uzu Uzu hole?
Blaze says the Uzu Uzu could take it back.
Really?
Oh, it's just a kid.
Maybe not.
Wait a minute...
It's the zombie police!
Run!
We're in trouble now! Throw that thing out!
No.
No.
Whose side are you on?
No. It's alive.
Hurry Posse! They're catching up!
I can't make sharp turns. Oh well.
They're still after us!
Man... they're relentless.
Whoa!!!
Thanks, Blaze.
This is where the secret weapon Black Maria is hidden.
Wow. Pretty impressive.
We're here. I hate running.
What secret weapon? It doesn't even have an engine.
Don't worry. It's all downhill.
The Uzu Uzu's lighting up. Hurry!
They're on us!
They're all over!
Behind you, Posse!
We're crossing the bridge.
Darn! The bridge is rising. Move, Posse!
I can't see a thing!
But I can't stop!
It's not just the bridge. Listen!
It's Valboot!
Shoot. We're slowing down.
We're trapped!
We can do it! Blaze! Give Posse lots of water.
Hurry!
What are you doing?
I'm so bloated!
I'm gonna blow!
Stop! I'm right behind you...
We need you right there!
Push down on Posse's stomach!
One, two,
Three!
I'm gonna blow!
We can't get any closer.
Ratt, give me your shoelaces.
OK.
There!
You're a genius.
Fly!
Hey, it's dangerous if you don't watch where you're walking.
I'm home.
The front door opened just now, didn't it?
But no one's there.
Can I go to your place now?
I don't mind.
Did something happen?
No, nothing.
Just the usual.
The usual?
What's the usual?
How should I know?
You don't need to know.
I'll see you later.
Damn it!
Hey, sorry for coming so suddenly.
Again?
Hello? There's no one here.
The doorbell rang just now, didn't it?
That's not good!
The man has to apologize.
Even when it's obviously her fault?
Ah, well, she knows it's her fault as well.
But you see, if the man doesn't bow down first,
she won't be able to find the chance to apologize.
Ah, but still...
Well, yeah, that's not good.
You've got to apologize.
Even when it's obviously his fault?
Well, he knows it's his fault as well.
But you see, if a woman like you doesn't bow down first,
he won't be able to find the chance to apologize.
That's no joke, though.
That's because you're stubborn.
I'm not stubborn.
Ah, hello?
Well, that's not good.
She should be the one apologizing.
Even when it's obviously Tanaka's fault?
Ah, well, Tanaka-kun knows it's her fault as well.
But you know, she's got pride.
The person you are calling does not have their phone turned on, or has no power.
Please call again.
Hello??
Hello? Hello?
Ah, It's Yagisawa Yuu, I just called you earlier.
Ah, Yagisawa-kun? Where are you now?
Right under you, at the entrance.
Okay, hold on a bit.
I'm coming down now.
Ah, could there be...
What?
I...
I would like to use that.
Sorry.
Hello?
It's me.
Oh, grandma? You're here already?
That was quick.
Hold on a bit, I'll open it now.
Hello? Is something wrong?
Could there be... what?
Ah, forget it.
Can I come down?
Yeah, sure.
What's wrong?
Why'd you throw your bag?
Ah, well...
That was strange.
For an instant, I thought I saw another you.
He was the previous, clumsy me.
What do you mean?
Anyway, I'm glad.
Glad? What for?
That the one you see is me.
What do you mean?
Meaning that I was first this time.
I just don't see what you're getting at.
Yeah.
It's quite pretty here.
I really saw another you just now, though.
You too?
What do you mean, "you too?"
Are you a twin?
Is that it? That's it, right?
Or maybe you're a triplet!
Hey, isn't it cold?
I don't really get it either.
There are a lot of me.
And if I'm careless,
my other selves will steal my places.
But I guess you still wouldn't understand.
I can't explain it well.
Anyway, I'm glad I met you.
A void.
That which is not essential.
Extremely wrong and extremely unhealthy.
Our intentions entrap our souls in another's.
It is unnatural. We each have our own place.
They don't know I am judging them by my own watch.
A God that is emotional, not rational.
An embodiment.
External circumstances.
A fake window creates balance.
Absence and corruption.
Probability...
Habits.
Codes. Words.
Prayer.
Why did God create prayer?
To impart dignity to cause and effect...
To allow us to implore... to teach us...
Our souls see numbers, space, activity.
We think of nothing else.
Who would doubt that
we think of nothing else?
But we have no light.
Words change the meaning of things, but the meaning remains the same.
Eternity.
Circle of life.
Literally, it's a falsehood, therefore spiritually, a truth.
A kind of dubious obscurity.
No price is too high for immortality.
{\fad(0,500)}If it weren't dubious, Man would not know his own corruption.
{\fad(500,0)}If there was no light, Man would not seek salvation.
Protector of God's Grace.
Salvation...
When miracles betray hope...
When miracles reward hope...
Chance changes our minds, Chance deprives our minds.
We have no ability to acquire our thoughts.
It is not what motivates us.
It is not desirable to be an exception to the rule.
We should judge exceptions strictly but fairly.
Paganism in its independent and purely natural state.
Dreams.
Absence and corruption.
We create God for ourselves.
Those who know him, serve him wholeheartedly.
They don't know I am judging them by my own watch.
Fear.
Hatred.
Submission.
Those who don't know God, truly desire Him.
Probability.
There are 3 types of people.
The ones in the middle are unfortunate and conform to reason.
The ones at the end are unfortunate and foolish.
Bad thoughts are necessary.
Recognize yourself and follow your carnal desires.
There is an Art.
As long as it is not denied,
whether it's a principle of truth or flesh,
this Art clarifies the relationship between principles.
All creatures torture and tempt him.
And control him through violence,
or through gentle temptation.
This latter is more terrifying and absolute.
Two extremes.
Exclusion of reason. Absolute belief in reason.
What causes the phenomenon?
Lust and power are the source of our intentions.
Lust is a voluntary intention and power is an involuntary intention.
People begin to rebel against perfection itself.
If you know your own sins, you will lose heart.
Because I believe in you and the depravity of those sins.
If you don't want it to end,
you must make people believe it is true and eternal.
You must hide its origin.
Probability will provide certainty.
We are automated as well as spiritual.
Complete your salvation fearfully.
The epitome of evil.
An embodiment.
Man has lost his way. Fallen from grace.
Trying to find his place.
But who will deliver him there?
A secure foothold.
God's Grace.
{\fad(0,500)}The strongest and most credible proof are our habits.
{\fad(500,500)}Habits influence automation
{\fad(500,500)}and automation unwittingly drags the mind with it.
{\fad(500,0)}You must make them believe, so this isn't reversed.
A kind of dubious obscurity.
Vague ambiguity.
Nature is an image. Darkness.
God guides us to the one essential thing through diversity
to satisfy both sides.
I don't know... they say.
What's not perfectly good is just an embodiment of it.
The only necessity.
Exclusion of reason. Absolute belief in reason.
Two extremes.
Without this mediator,
we will lose all contact with God.
Protector of God's Grace.
Language is the same either way.
Those who pass judgment, need a focal point.
The lecture on God's Grace.
Witnesses who don't excuse death.
Two witnesses.
A ladder.
Two foundations.
One internal, one external.
God's Grace and miracles are both natural phenomena.
Not only do we see things from a different perspective,
we see through different eyes.
So, why would they appear the same?
If God supports nature,
then let nature prove this clearly,
I often wished.
The work of God's Grace. Absence and corruption.
An embodiment.
Nature made all these things mutually exclusive.
Tyranny.
A fake window creates balance.
People only seek horizontal symmetry.
Not in height or depth.
If you recognize me, compare yourself to me.
What are you comparing?
Yourself? Or me within you ?
If it is yourself, that is despicable.
You are comparing me to myself.
For 4000 years, people continued to
prophesize about His Coming.
To desire glory. Greatness.
Probability.
But is it probable that probability provides certainty?
Truth does not inhabit the earth. Truth wanders amongst us.
Those who escape it are fortunate.
God's Grace is a natural phenomenon.
To prove that nature is the image of God
we are perfect in some sense.
To prove we are only but an image, we have some faults.
Reason controls us much more severely.
Nature has made us extremely neutral.
We always end up evening the scales.
God guides us to the one essential thing through diversity,
to satisfy both sides.
Imagine a body full of bodies of thought.
If it splits, and doesn't return to the whole,
it was only meant for death and destruction.
Universal good is within us.
It is us, but is not us.
Because it is infinite.
A prisoner awaiting his execution.
Contradiction.
It belittles us.
It hates us.
If two things unite without changing, one will not become the other.
Thus, our spirit unites with our bodies
and maintains a balance of opposing vices.
Our souls are thrown into a body
and find numbers, time, a third dimension. It makes inferences,
and calls it nature, inevitability. We cannot think of anything else.
We recognize truth not just through reason, but through emotion.
Emotion senses that space has a third dimension.
It senses principle, and a proposition is made.
Emotion, instinct, principle.
Instinct and reason. Two natural symbols.
God's Grace will always exist, as will nature.
Therefore, God's Grace is natural, in a sense.
Birth symbolizing the creation of Man.
Baptism symbolizing the Atonement.
He came to this earth to impart truth without symbolism.
But to say he only came symbolically and to refute his existence
is a blasphemy.
Love is not a symbolic rule.
By systematically explaining the origin of love,
one cannot confirm that he should be loved.
One must sympathize with both sides.
But while one is sympathy born of love,
the other is sympathy born of contempt.
The various origins of love.
Protector of God's Grace.
Contradiction.
Unspoken desire. Deception. Salvation
The only necessity.
Dream.
The difference between rest and ease of conscience.
Nothing besides the truth is certain.
The first birth creates the former. The Grace of the second creates the latter.
I can love complete darkness
but if God thinks me unlucky,
that haphazardness will anger me.
I don't accept its merits. Not like complete darkness.
So it makes me angry.
This is proof that I idolize darkness and have drifted far from God's Order.
I don't know who I am and what I should do.
I don't know my state of being or my responsibility.
My heart wants to search for and serve God.
I will sacrifice everything to find it.
No price is too high for immortality.
A God that conducts all with benevolent will.
His power and intimidation.
Tyranny.
He, who is worthy of atonement.
Of receiving it.
Infinity, large and small.
Order of a limited perfection
created for the sake of infinity.
When all those teachings are contained in one,
as if hidden inside a box,
they will appear, essentially chaotic.
It is not true that everything manifests God.
Nor that God is hidden from us.
But God hides himself from those who test him,
and reveals himself to those who believe.
Inside this gigantic prison, there is no direction.
In the hands of an angry God.
Time.
Once an immortal being exists, he always exists.
We want to live an imaginary life within another's mind.
God is infinite, first of all.
Empty Space.
That cannot be changed by will. It is power and intimidation.
Tyranny.
The be all and end all.
A mutual and inescapable relationship.
Error and falsehood.
The Protector of truth.
Another form of insanity.
Hateful things.
Fear.
God's deeds. Salvation.
Infinite chaos separates us.
And somewhere in that infinity, a bet is being wagered.
Will it be a crucifix, or will it not?
Our souls are thrown into a body
and find numbers, time, a third dimension.
Activity at a standstill.
Countless infinity.
Ambiguous and limitless.
Our nature is in activity. Total stillness means death.
A void. Order.
Nature placed the entirety of truth inside themselves.
Our intentions entrap our souls in another's.
We each have our own place.
Our imagination makes small things big enough to fulfill us
and makes big things small so that they are more like us.
We make ourselves for our own God.
Adam's glory.
The spark of fire. Finding a focal point.
The circle of life.
The never ending reversal from right to wrong.
Amazing geometry.
Infinite numbers. A limited, yet infinite space.
Numbers duplicate space.
Nature diversifies and duplicates.
Artificiality duplicates and diversifies.
All unresolved matters still exist.
His Words...
The God within God...
He gave life to all through His own rebirth.
Emptiness. Power.
A focal point. A void.
That which is not essential. Extremely wrong...
But in order to maintain His supremacy,
God granted prayer to His believers.
A wish for dependent independence.
Insufficiency.
Prayer.
Everything is duality.
Everyone is both alive and dead.
The chosen and abandoned always exist in the marvelous order.
The root of self-love.
The hateful thing.
Me.
Hazuki.
Eh? Me?
Yeah.
Hey...
Just for today,
how about we forget about tomorrow and the future
and go somewhere?
What's with the formality?
Let's go.
You mean skipping class?
Well, yeah, if you want the complete truth.
Sure, I don't mind.
How about seeing how far we can go with the money we have on us?
Like where?
I guess criminals just gotta go south.
That's kind of clichéd.
Where, then?
I know.
I've never been to Shonan.
There's nothing there.
I want to play with some fireworks at the beach.
<i>Isn't that clichéd?</i>
Can't we go?
Sure.
It's kind of surprising for you to be skipping though, Shou-kun.
You think so?
Well, I thought you were an honor student.
Not really.
Well, you can study really well.
I always thought it was amazing.
It's just a hassle.
I hate how parents or teachers talk to you just because you can't study.
<i>And I hate being told what to do.</i>
But, well, this is my first time skipping.
<i>See? You are an honor student.</i>
So you skip often, Hazuki?
Well, sometimes.
Delinquent girl.
What?
It feels like it's been a long time since we talked like this.
Look.
Ah, you got them.
Do you remember about our secret when we were in elementary school?
What happened to it?
I tried to use it once.
Really?
<i>There was this one terrible teacher when I was in middle school.</i>
You went to a girls' school, so I'm sure you don't know,
but he hit us a lot.
And, well, I thought of blowing up the staff office.
What? Scared?
Ah, no.
But it all ended without me using it.
I see. That's great, then.
I actually have it with me right now.
No way...
Only you and I know about this.
Let's go somewhere and bury it.
Yeah.
Hey.
I guess you're really not an honor student.
Do you know the way?
It's probably this way.
Which way...
Can't we just follow someone who looks like they're going to the beach?
What the hell? Where is this?
Did we pass it?
No way...
What the hell? Why'd you stop here, you bastard!
What should we do? I only have 1000 yen.
I guess during times like this...
You'd go wild with a stolen bike.
That's what I'd like to do, but this is the best that we can do.
Think you can make it?
I think it'll take a lot longer.
Hey, hey, you two without lights!
Stop, stop.
What should we do? It's a cop.
Hey!
H-'s fast!
H-He's fast!
You're not getting away!
Hey, that way's...
Hey, it's dangerous to be riding around here.
What era did this guy come from?
Hey, you listening?
Oh, she's a real hottie.
Hey, leave the woman behind,
and then you can leave.
I decided that today I wouldn't think about tomorrow or the future.
Basically...
I don't give a damn!
Hey, what's that? Hey.
Hey, you, wait!
Hey,, hey!
Hey, hey,
Hey, hey, hey!
Shit!
Oh, right, fireworks.
It's already getting bright.
We're already here, so let's do it.
Plus, we don't have a lighter.
Then what about a flint?
I guess not.
Hey, why'd you ask me to come along?
I'm moving tomorrow.
With my parents.
When I'm gone, everyone will eventually forget about me.
I don't even remember much about my friend who moved long ago.
That's obvious.
But I suddenly wanted to go somewhere with you.
"And just like that...
we should go somewhere," or so I thought.
When I was kid,
you lived next door and I always admired you.
I've always loved you.
But now...
That third year senior, right?
So you know.
You walk together with him a lot.
Yeah...
I know about it.
Let's go home.
We can't go anywhere.
When does it leave?
Tonight at seven.
You don't need to see me off.
Okay.
You'd feel more lonely, I guess.
What's wrong, Shou?
It's nothing.
