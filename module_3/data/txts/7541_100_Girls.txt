- Okay, good.
Now we got business.
Can we please do this tomorrow?
Nope.
I'm sorry. I overreacted.
She can come over for dinner.
Once, okay?
Nope.
What more do you want from me?
Your hands where I can see them.
[CHUCKLES] Seriously?
Oh, yeah.
Babe, I'm legit so tired.
Yeah, but you just came back
from a girls' trip.
Trust me, it was not relaxing.
Oh, you could just lie there.
- I was stupid.
- I know.

That means your daughter is one

Okay, I just need to take a quick peek
in your mom's bedroom,
and then I am out of here.
- No, wait.
- Sweetie!
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?
- Nothing.
- Okay, that doesn't look

- It's fine.
How long has this been
bleeding like this?
Since I made the shrimp.
Okay, how long did you
leave her alone today?
I have to get you a Band-Aid.
We don't have any. I already looked.
If this is a latchkey situation,
I'm gonna have to report it.
- It's totally not.
- Honey, it's okay, Sadie.
- She never leaves me alone.
- Sadie.
Normally, I don't. But today I had to.
I had something really
important come up,
and I... I just lost track of the time.
Because of the mentally
disabled cancer kids?
Sadie, I have to take you to a hospital.
I... I think you need stitches.
Your car has the boot. The boot.
Um...
I'm kind of in between vehicles
at the moment.
Any chance you could give us a lift?
Okay, come on, boo. Oh, my goodness.
- Oh.
- [CREAKING]
Oh, ooh, your feet smell
like you're a high school
football player.
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hey, I love you so much.
You know that?
I love you all the way
to the moon and back.

[CLEARS THROAT] Hey, so...
[CLEARS THROAT]
I have been thinking about our
little sitch.
And...
If we were smart,
we would get back together.
[STAMMERS] Just hear me out.
Okay, so look.
I would totally wanna
divorce my ass, too.
But in the end, I wouldn't.
I would not.
Why not?
Why not?
Because of the ancient rule of two.
- The ancient rule of two?
- Yes.
Two houses, two mortgages,
two... two cable bills.
Okay.
Two water sewage garbage fees?
I mean, that... that...
that's craziness.
Wow, it is so romantic,
the way you're wooing me
right now, honestly.
I'm not wooing you.
I'm begging you not to leave me.
By way of sewage fees.
Well, I was gonna mention
that you are the love of my life.
And that I wish everything could go back
to the way it was.
Because I had no damn idea
how good I had it
until it was gone,
but then I thought that sounded
kind of cheesy, so I decided to focus
on the cable bill,
which kind of isn't really playing out
like I thought it was gonna.
Look, I... I know you hate me right now.
I don't hate you.
[SCOFFS]
Good.
Look, I just... I just don't
think we have
much of a choice.
There's always a choice.

Hey, man, is there anyone else
who wants to testify this morning?
Anybody?
- I would.
- Ah.
- You would?
- I would.
Sister Ruby.
Hello, everyone.
Um, I would just like to follow
up on the other day.
To be totally honest, I am not feeling
super good about it.
Sheila, you went above and
beyond for our little girl.
I don't even know how you put
together all that money.
You're still at the salon, right?
I've saved here and there
over the years.
Well, listen.
I realize that I reacted badly.
Because I have a hard time
taking charity.
Pride is a sin, as we all know.
ALL: Amen.
So I would just like to say something
that I should have said before.
Which is thank you.
- [APPLAUSE]
- Thank you for the money.
You're welcome.
And thank you for offering
to drive the kids
home from school when I'm at work.
And thanks for offering
to babysit so that we
can have a date night.
And offering to do the laundry
and, oh, my God, the groceries.
- At Whole Foods, no less.
- Seriously?
Because this woman...
This woman only buys
- organic, people.
- [APPLAUSE]
I don't even know what to say.
There's nothing to say.
But thank you.
Got it.
I know you do.
- [APPLAUSE]
- Praise the Lord.
God bless you, Sheila.
Sometimes our prayer simply
needs to be "Lord Jesus,
"help me to learn to be generous.
To labor and to not seek reward."
- Let us all simply say...
- ALL: Amen.
[SHOPPING CARTS RATTLING]
Well, look who's finally using the pen.
Yeah, it just felt a little crispy.
- Hmm, let me try.
- Uh, no, I'm sure it's fine.
- I mean...
- Let me see.
It's legit.
Good thing, 'cause customer's long gone.
Next time try checking before
they leave the store.
Good pro tip.
Oh, uh, do anything fun on your day off?
Just hung out with my kid.
Is that all?
Is there something you wanna ask me?
Just making conversation.
