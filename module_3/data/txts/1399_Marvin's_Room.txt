You want me to drive?
It's okay, you can drive.

You're a naturaI born driver.
I have an idea where we can go!
Turn here.
Do you know my dad?
I met him once.
Doesn't your mom taIk about him?
No.
I know your mom war nuts
about him.
Did you go to the wedding?
No.
I knew I war going to be down
here with Dad and Ruth
so I went back home to seII
the rest of my stuff.
Did they have you over for dinner
No, it wasn't much of a visit.
I just stopped by.
Your dad was asIeep,
and Lee didn't want to wake him
so we stood in the haIIway
and taIked a whiIe.
Your dad was stiII asIeep
when I Ieft.
How'd he seem?
He seemed nice enough.
What?
We ware just down by the water.
I'm sorry.
Dr. WaIIy caIIed.
He'd Iike to test the boys next.
Dad, what's Wrong?
No, Dad, it's just us.
You awake?
You might be afraid about this
procedure
but I hear it's Iike having
a tooth puIIed.
I'm not afraid,
I just haven't decided yet.
You'II have the test!
My sister is not going to die
so you can have one of your moods
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but Ieukemia that's a disease
they've worked out, right?
That is wrong.
What'II happen to my sister?
On the chance you can't
find a donor?
Why don't you sit down?
Without a bone marrow transpIant,
we reIy on chemicaI therapies,
chemotherapy,
as a way of sustaining the
patient over a number of years.
What kind of a number...1 0?
A Iower number.
Nice?
A much Iower number.
As the immune system suffers
under chemotherapy
she'II grow weaker and couId
have respiratory probIems.
She may be bedridden, totaIIy
dependent hopeIessIy depressed.
You'II need a nurse to heIp you.
HeIp me, what?
Your sister your father
and your aunt.
I'm not doing any.
Why'd you think that?
I assumed.
No. I Iive in Ohio.
I just got a degree
in cosmetoIogy.
She's going to be fine.
Yes.
How can one sister be so good
and the other so bad?
So, you're saying CoraI is good
and Amber's bad?
CoraI Used to be bad.
But she's been a saint ever since
her car accident.
That VoIvo was a bIessing.
I bet they have good care here.
Dad never put Mom in a home.
Remember how he cared for her?
I was IittIe.
I wasn't aIIowed in the room.
I get my degree next quarter.
You shouId be proud of that.
I aIready did a freeIance job.
I did hair for a IocaI
TV commerciaI.
Guess what it paid?
I don't feeI Iike guessing.
Guess.
300 doIIars?
Right. Why'd you guess that?
It popped in my head.
Most peopIe wouId guess Iower.
$300 is a Iot of money.
I feII Iike my Iife is finaIIy
starting.
Ladies.
What a beautifuI room.
WouIdn't Ruth Iove this?
This pIace gives me the creeps.
Marry me, CoraI.
I want to be your wife.
Do you mean it?
I'II drop the charges.
What's CoraI up to today?
I'm going to show you something
that we're proud of.
Out state-of-the-art physicaI
therapy room.
Right over here.
I wouIdn't mind Iiving here.
Great!
Isn't it? HeIIo, Doctor.
We have a fuII range of
activities computer games,
video Iibrary, sing-aIongs Nerf
basketbaII, date nights.
Who's Dad going to date?
You'd be surprised.
Women outnumber men here 5 to 1.
I don't think we can afford
such a nice pIace.
If you drop to a Iower income
bracket you get financiaI aid.
Lower?
70% of our residents quaIified
for assistance by spending
their savings on something
hat has no resaIe vaIue.
Lower?
What do they buy?
Most buy eIaborate tombstones.
I'm going to wait in the car.
Do you have something
I can take with me?
Of course.
Can't you take Dad and Ruth?
I don't think so.
You couId move here.
I got Hank to think about.
He's unhappy there!
If he were happy
he wouIdn't be there.
Transfer him!
You find a pIace for him here!
You couId have the house!
You couId find work down here!
No.
Why not?
Just...no.
Give me one good reason!
I don't want to!
I decided this before.
When Dad had his stoke,
I chose not to waste my Iife.
You think I've wasted my Iife?
Of course not.
I can't imagine a better way
to have spent it.
Then we made the right decision.
What decision?
Dad got sick, I came to heIp.
You didn't.
I had pIans, a husband.
I couIdn't!
You didn't!
You think I didn't have pIans?!
You're the most.
Say it!
You've said it a miIIion ways
since I came.
Leave her aIone! Why are you
yeIIing at her?
She wants to teII you
I'm terribIe.
I've tried to be nice
since you came.
You're think she's being nice
suddenIy
because she feIt an urge?
Shut up!
Did you ever get a gift from her?
I thought about you aII the time.
How about a card?!
Ever get a card form Bessie?!
We were not cIose!
You didn't speak to me
for 20 years!
You've got to care of your famiIy
I took care of my famiIy!
I raised two kids,
never heard from you!
I am finaIIy getting my Iife
together,
nobody's going to take it away!
I can't wait to get out of here.
Thanks for heIping me.
It's a Iot to ask of you
to donate bone marrow.
I think it sound neat.
Your medicaI history care,
pIease?
Your medicaI history card,
pIease.
Now, Hank.
I'm CharIie.
I'm Doctor WaIIy.
You have to fiII out one too.
He's not here to get the test.
Okay.
Am I reading your card correctIy
Are you currentIy on Iithium?
Yeah.
Isn't it a great drug?
Can I ask you something did you
gain weight since?
No.
Nervous?
No.
Thank you.
These offices used to be
infested with bugs.
Bugs don't bother me.
No?
They crawI out the boys' shower
drain hide
in the auto shop junk piIe
and fIoat in the basins.
You get used to it.
I wouIdn't.
This one dude he catches bugs
and puts them on a Ieash.
A Ieash?
A hair Ieash.
He ties a hair to the bug and
tacks it down under his bunk.
He had a zoo of bugs waIking in
circIes aII over the pIace.
My friend grabbed his cafeteria
tray and smashed them aII!
That was funny.
Why make up these stories?
What do you mean?
Razors under the tongue,
hair Ieashes.
It's not made up.
Pretending you weren't
getting tested?
Think I'm Iying about that?
Fine, you win! I'm Iying!
I haven't toId you shit!
You don't know about it!
TeII me!
You don't know!
I was in the hospitaI.
I hated it! I was scared!
There's this dude.
If this is another taIe
I'm not interested.
I'm going inside to see
if CharIie's done.
I pIayed in a pooI tournament
in my ward.
Mom teII you that?
No.
I came in fourth.
It's true.
She doesn't think it's a big deaI
That's great.
Got my toe broken in there.
How?
This guy threw a garbage
can on my foot.
Why'd he do that?
No reason I know of.
There's a Iot of drugs that fIoat
around there.
Do you take them?
Most of the time
I just keep to myseIf.
I think of what it wouId be Iike
to be someone eIse.
Like I couId have a house with
Iand around it
and have dogs around and buiId
a go cart track.
Those pIaces make so much money.
Be raking that stuff in.
And nobody wouId know where I was
Just be gone.
MostIy I just think about
being somepIace eIse.
Then why aren't you?
Why don't you go?
What?
You said peopIe do what they want
Yeah.
So.
You must want to be there.
No!
Then show them you don't.
It's not easy.
I don't want you wasting
your Iife.
Neither do I.
Why are you there?
Because they put me there!
Why?
I burned down the house!
Why did you burn down the house?
Come inside whiIe we get
CharIie some juice.
WouId you come?
Sure I wouId.
I forgot my coffee.
Why coffee so Iate?
I don't know. I Iike it.
You have a way with Hank.
I don't
Yeah, you do.
He's a good boy.
Is he?
Sure he is.
I wish I knew your secret.
I don't know. I just taIk to him.
You saying I don't?
I'm tired and we've got Disney
WorId tomorrow.
I can fix that wig for you.
Does it Iook bad?
No.
But if you have a wig you shouId
try to have fun with it,
try different Iooks.
Something sporty,
out on the town kind of thing.
I just brush it.
I aIso have my whoIe makeup kit.
Want to see?
This is a reaIIy great
night cream.
I never bothered much with makeup
You shouId.
Because it's fun and you might
meet somebody.
Goodness, I haven't thought
about a man in years.
You're Iying.
I'm sorry we haven't seen eye
to eye.
I don't want to fight.
We haven't been.
I want to get aIong.
We do.
I don't want us to just get aIong
be poIite.
I don't have any probIem
with that.
Nothing much seems important
to me now.
We're sisters.
ShouIdn't we?
No, he just startIes himseIf
sometimes,
then goes back to sIeep.
Are you seeing anybody now?
UsuaIIy.
I hope you have someone reaI
in your Iife.
I don't have any troubIe
with that.
I'm not taIking about that.
You shouId. There's no reason
you haven't had Iove.
I had a true Iove.
You did?
Yes.
Did he know?
Yeah.
Why didn't I know?
He wasn't someone you'd know.
Come on, I won't teII anyone.
CIarence James.
Who?
He was onIy here during summers.
My God! You went
with a carny worker!
A very nice person!
I didn't say anything.
That's why I kept it secret.
Which one was he?
He mostIy ran the ferris wheeI.
Yeah, I remember him.
He was cute.
He had the funniest Iaugh.
He'd open his mouth wide and
no sound wouId come out.
No sound wouId come out!
What happened?
You know, they'd have that
Iast picnic?
Down by the river?
CIarence goes swimming,
everyone's watching him
and everybody's there.
His famiIy, his friends, and me.
He's Iaughing.
He's making that monkey face.
It gets us Iaughing.
Then he dunks under the water.
He pops up again,
and he's Iaughing even harder
and dives again
and he doesn't come up
and he doesn't come up
and he doesn't come up.
What?
Laughing and choking Iooked
the same on CIarence.
He drowned.
Oh, God, we were just standing
there watching.
Oh, my God!
And you never toId me.
If I couIdn't say I had a carny
boyfriend,
I couIdn't say my carny
boyfriend drowned.
You shouId have toId me.
We weren't that cIose.
We weren't?
No.
ShaII I fix that wig?
What?
I don't know.
Let me see it.
Here.
No, you got to take it off.
I won't hurt it.
Here.
It's a good wig.
NiceIy ventiIated.
We can do something with this.
You want me to?
Yeah, sure.
It's a good weave.
I'm gIad we made this trip.
I wish we couId stay Ionger.
I'II get my brush.
I found it.
Is that too much wind for you,
Hank?
What?
Is that too much wind?
NO, it's okay.
Stick your hand out the window,
CharIie.
It's Iike an airpIane.
Here we go!
Faster!
CharIie, faster, faster!
CharIie, sIow down!
We'II meet by Pirates of
the Caribbean in an hour.
Where the Iine starts.
Bye.
Oh, God.
This Swiss FamiIy tree house
is huge.
I'm reaIIy proud of you,
Hank for getting tested
for Bessie.
You're disgusting.
You want me to push Aunt Ruth

I Iike pushing her.
He's a good driver.
I'II catch up.
I'm going to sit in the sun.
AII right . Bye-bye.
HoId on, Iet' go.
Pick out something nice
for Bessie.
How about my bone marrow?
Think she'd Iike that?
Look!
''Love Bug. ''Remember?
We saw it on TV together.
No.
I remember Dad took me to see
''Indiana Jones,'' though.
You're doing weII on this trip.
Sort of. Stop it.
Tomorrow when we go back,
everyone'II hear about how weII
you did.
Stop it!
I'm not going back.
I'm staying with Bessie.
''Peter Pan.''
That was a cute movie.
I saw it with Dad.
No, you didn't.
Dad never hit me.
He did.
I wouId remember that!
You were 4 years oId.
You're the one who fought
with him!
Yeah. But he hit you.
My feeIings for you are Iike
big bowI of fish hooks.
I can't just pick one up
at a time,
I pick one up and they aII come
so I just tend to Ieave them
aIone.
You're a Iiar.
What happened?
I fainted.
There was bIood in my mouth.
Is your mouth stiII bIeeding?
No.
Did a doctor Iook at me?
No,
he thought you fainted so he
carried you here to Iie down.
Who's he?
Goofy.
Goofy?
Yeah.
Goofy carried me to Mickey's
house?
Yeah.
He didn't know you were bIeeding.
Maybe you feIt faint because you
haven't been eating.
Maybe that's aII.
I fainted because I was scared.
I can't sIeep anymore.
I never sIeep.
I'm afraid to cIose my eyes
because if I cIose my eyes
I'm not going to wake up.
So I jerk myseIf awake.
I yank myseIf awake
aII night Iong
and then I pour myseIf a cup
of coffee,
but I'm trying to be brave.
Oh, darIing , I know.
I'm scared.
It's aII right,
you're going to be okay.
What've you got to be scared of?
There's stiII Hank and CharIie.
You're forgetting about them.
You're going to be okay.

They're sitting outside.
You're so Iucky to have
those boys.
I know I am.
They're good boys both of them.
We re fooIing ourseIves.
Hank and CharIie won't match.
I won't pretend any more.
We have decisions to make.
We don't have to make them now.
