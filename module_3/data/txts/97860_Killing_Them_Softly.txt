<i>America.</i>
<i>I say to the people of America...</i>
<i>...this moment is our chance to...</i>
<i>To make of our own lives
what we will. It is...</i>
<i>...that pushes us forward.</i>
<i>...the American promise alive.</i>
<i>It is that promise
that's always set this country apart.</i>
<i>It's a promise that says
each of us has the freedom</i>
<i>to make of our own lives
what we will.</i>
You're late!
You're fucking three hours late!
Don't start on me.
You couldn't have gotten me
somebody else? This looks like shit.
No manners.
We're not gonna put up with this.
You asked me
to get somebody all right.
Russell's a wiseass,
but he's all right if you can stand him.
And a guy like you,
you want a job done,
don't have the balls to do it yourself,
you ought to try pretty hard to.
I don't like this guy.
He's too fucking fresh for my blood.
Shut up and stop jerking the guy's
chain. He's trying to do us a favour.
- Doing us a favour?
- A favour.
I thought he wanted us
to do him a favour.
Is that the straight shit, Squirrel?
Trying to do me a favour?
Get the fuck out!
Man, why are you talking to me
like that? Come on.
You sell people dry cleaning,
and you talk to them like that?
The two guys I get to do this,
they're gonna cut up about 30,
I figure 30K.
And Australians like him, Frankie,
I can buy for 80 cents a dozen.
They throw another in for free.
You know what you do?
Get me another guy.
I'm not gonna put up with this shit.
John, he'll be all right, OK?
Trust me.
Friend, you picked the wrong guy
for a thing once.
You remember?
Remember the doctor?
And I just knew
that this was the wrong guy.
- What do I...? I take him anyway.
- I need the dough. Don't fuck around.
And after seven years in the can
and my kids are grown up
and my business isn't doing
what it should be, I can't get that back.
From now on, I'm taking my time.
That's all there is to it.
I had my last fuck-up.
Call me Thursday.
Thursday I'll know.
<i>I've gotta give
a new direction to this economy.</i>
Come on. That a girl.
Good girl. Look.
All right, you're here.
- We going there or what?
- That depends.
Don't depend on me.
It's Thursday. You coming or not?
Oh, man. Fuck that guy.
He's a dick.
Doesn't know if he wants me or not.
Well, I don't need him, mate.
I got my own thing going on, mate.
Me and Kenny, you know,
we're snatching these dogs,
purebreds, and selling them
down in Florida.
I got 5 grand in the kit, mate.
When I get 7, I'm gonna go
and buy an ounce of smack
and I'm gonna become a dealer.
Plus this afternoon,
I got a girl I can go and fuck.
Right?
So I'm thinking it's a choice,
you know.
Oh, tough one.
Am I gonna go and fuck a girl,
or am I gonna go to a meeting
with the Squirrel?
Oh, fuck a girl, meeting with Squirrel.
Fuck Squirrel.
I think I'll go fuck the girl.
I'd like to see this girl.
The kind of girl you can screw
off an ad in the paper?
Probably got a handful
of broken glass in there.
Yeah, well, you know,
these girls, you see them,
you probably wouldn't wanna
rape them
but all the plumbing works just fine.
So I guess you're not coming then.
Look, go ahead, see if you can get him
to tell you anything about it.
If you still like it then, then I'm in.
If not, if he doesn't want me, I'm out.
But I'm not wasting an afternoon on it.
That much, I'm not doing.
- There it is.
- All right, fuck it.
<i>I don't know. I've been
asking around about him, you know.</i>
Not many people. I don't want anybody
to think I got something in mind.
Nobody knows this guy.
Heh. It's not the kind of guy
we want to have in on this.
These are not the kind of people
that are around a bank.
They expect some guy's gonna
rob them and it's not their money.
These are not these people at all.
They see somebody
that's not absolutely cool,
that they can tell
doesn't know what he's doing,
they're liable to get up off their ass
and start making trouble.
They're gonna shoot somebody,
and I don't want that.
There's no reason for that.
You don't get more money.
It don't make sense.
Yeah, I don't mean anything.
At least you got an idea, you know?
- You still coming up dry, huh?
- Yeah. You know what I did?
I go to probation, like I believe
that shit they're handing out.
"Here's something.
Place in Halbrook needs assemblers,
"$130 a week, 4 to midnight,
steady work.
"It'll keep you out of trouble."
Beautiful. Well, I live in Somerville.
How am I gonna get to Halbrook
in the afternoon?
How the fuck am I gonna get home
in the middle of the night?
"Buy a car." With what?
I haven't got no money.
What am I gonna buy a car with?
Why they think I need a job
in the first place?
Fucking assholes. Then I see Russell.
He's coming right along.
Probably buy a hotel
in the next couple weeks.
- Not on dogs.
- No, he's just doing that.
Gonna buy some stuff,
soon as he gets enough.
He's gonna get nabbed.
He ought to buy himself
a new toothbrush
because he's gonna need it.
John, you're the guy with the angle.
Tell me what the angle is.
You think dog-lover there
can handle a card game?
Shit, those fucking things?
Those things are protected.
You can't do those
unless you're so stupid
you like everybody trying to off you.
- There's one you can do.
- There's ten I can do.
I know at least ten, but then I'm gonna
have eight hot ginzos looking for me.
Not this one. The minute it happens,
they're gonna know right off who did it.
For some reason
that don't make me feel better.
Not us. They're not gonna think
it might be us.
They're gonna pick one guy,
go whack him, end of it.
And you and I are gonna out up
about 40, $50,000, no fucking sweat.
I don't know how I go
for setting somebody up.
You're not setting him up.
He set himself up.
Markie Trattman runs this game.
This is Markie's second game.
The first one got knocked over,
and it was Markie who did it.
<i>See, four years ago,
Markie was running this game</i>
<i>and he sees all the cash flying
around the room and he thinks,</i>
<i>"Jeez, two guys with shotguns
and stocking masks</i>
<i>could come in here
and really clean up."</i>
<i>So he thinks, "What the fuck,"
and he does it.</i>
- Put your hands in the air!
- Where's the fucking money?
Mike, get him the money.
Go, Mike!
<i>All the games
have to shut down. Pain in the ass.</i>
<i>Total fucking economic collapse.</i>
<i>Everyone's pissing and moaning.
No one's got any money.</i>
<i>Everybody's, you know, really upset.</i>
Fuck me.
Markie!
<i>They send Dillon out
to find out who did it.</i>
The fuck are you looking at?
Markie!
What?
<i>Dillon interrogates Markie.</i>
- What's going on? Hey!
- Hey.
You knock over the card game?
Jesus Christ! What the fuck!
Dillon!
<i>Markie holds up
under questioning.</i>
Dillon, what the fuck?
What's this all about?
<i>Dillon can't work it out,
who did it.</i>
<i>They think, "What the fuck."
One of those things.</i>
- Huh?
- Let's have a beer.
The fuck, man?
Stop crying.
<i>So eventually,
the games start up again.</i>
- No one's going out.
- The turn.
<i>Everything's getting back
to normal,</i>
<i>everyone's making money again.</i>
<i>And everyone's happy.</i>
<i>One night, they're all sitting around
and talking.</i>
<i>"Remember when the games
were shut down</i>
<i>and everyone was hearing footsteps
and what a drag?"</i>
Yeah, yeah, that was horrible.
<i>Markie starts laughing.</i>
<i>He can't help himself.</i>
You know what?
<i>He tells them it was him
that robbed his own game.</i>
- I did it!
<i>- Everyone thinks it's funny.</i>
<i>What the hell, it really wasn't
their money that was stolen.</i>
<i>And everyone loves Markie,
so they give him a pass.</i>
But if it happens again,
if Markie's game gets knocked over,
they're gonna know,
and Markie's gonna take the fall.
All right, well, fuck it. I'm in.
What about Russell?
I don't give a rat's ass.
You can go in with Tarzan
and his spotted jockstrap for all I care
if you can get him to do it. Ahem.
- But this thing's gotta move, all right?
- All right with me.
I gotta do something soon.
I'm gonna have to knock on the gate
and say:
"Let me in.
I can't think of nothing and it's cold."
It's a matter of time some other
bastard's gonna think of this.
It's gonna be gone,
and we don't have the money.
We're not the only smart guys
in the world.
Fuck, this a good car you got.
It's like the lounge room, mate,
but it's a good car.
Yeah, I wish you could
still get a car like this.
Keep this one.
Yeah, that's just what I need
is a nice, hot car.
- Not getting any, are you?
- Fuck yourself.
Tomorrow night I'm getting some.
If this goes all right,
this is my last night a priest.
I'll take care of my own hog.
Pfft. You had a bunch of practise
at taking care of your own hog.
That's fucking nice talk.
A guy like you,
sticking it in Goat-Ass' satchel.
- Fucking really nice talk.
- Hey, we were in jail, you know.
Rule number one: Find yourself
a lovely, clean older man.
Who the fuck told you
that Goat-Ass was clean?
Rule number two: If you can't find
that lovely, clean older man,
- take the dirty one.
- You're fucking sick.
We should've actually had them
get you a goat, you know.
Bring it into jail. You could fuck the goat.
You know, I had some clout
with the keepers.
Those poor dogs. You sure
you're not fucking with those dogs?
No, no, because they're dogs, they...
They bite, you know.
I mean, I'll give you some advice, mate.
Don't... Not with a dog, you know.
They can nip, from what I hear.
And that's very painful,
from what I hear.
You know, you're better off
with women, mate.
If you can get one, that is.
Well, maybe I'm not sure I can.
Oh, they're around.
There's broads just like us, mate.
Just as crazy as us too.
Like this one, she's beautiful,
mate, but she's crazy.
She's crazy. Let me tell you, all right.
I go up to the house, OK.
I've got a hard-on already.
She opens the door and, fuck, mate,
she was completely naked, you know.
I got quite nervous, mate,
because it's been a while.
She's like, "Are you gonna fuck me
or you gonna stand there all day?"
So I take her in there. I fuck her.
It's really... Oh.
Let me tell you, she fucked
like a fucking crazy alien
from the planet Gobble, you know?
- She started moaning and gobbling.
Really going crazy, just,
like, the cock goes in.
So roll off, done. Oh, fantastic.
Next words out of her mouth,
"I'm gonna kill myself."
They all say that.
That's the first thing they think of,
a lot of them.
It don't mean anything.
Yeah.
Here you go, man.
Jesus, that's what you fucking got,
dishwashing gloves?
Look, you take what you can fucking
get, all right?
- These fucking things are too thick.
- It's what they had.
They might have had
some latex gloves
from a fucking hospital or something.
You'll make do.
- There you go.
- Jesus, the fuck is this?
What does it look like?
It's a fucking sawn-off shotgun, OK?
It's what you asked me to get you.
I mean, you asked me for this.
We shoot somebody with this,
it's gonna kill everybody in the room.
Well, tell them that.
We're gonna look
like a bunch of amateurs in there.
- Take a breath.
- All right, you ready to do this?
- You don't have your glove on.
- I got my glove on.
- Just shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.
Like going out there
with a fucking grenade
and there's a fucking condom
on my hand.
Go, go, go, go, go.
All right, hands. All of you, hands!
Get your fucking hands up.
OK.
I hope you guys
know what you're doing.
Should I get the money?
Just take it easy.
Hands, hands!
You stop fucking looking at me.
Stop fucking looking at me.
Get your fucking hands up.
You know they're gonna kill you.
You know that, don't you?
That doesn't have to happen.
It shouldn't happen to you.
You should just put the gun down,
turn around,
and walk out the front door.
I'll take care of your friend.
I ain't gonna tell you again,
stop fucking looking at me.
Don't worry about him.
I'll take care of him for you.
What's going on in there?
Come on, now.
Hands, hands, hands!
Get your fucking hands up!
What's going on in there?
Talk to me!
What's going on in there?
You sure you wanna do this?
All right, put it on the table.
You want me to sit down?
Nice.
- All right, motherfucker, give it up!
- You got the money. Leave him alone.
Take out what you got
in your pockets.
Leave the bastard alone!
You got all the money.
Hey, shut the fuck up!
- Leave the bastard...
- Shut the fuck up!
You fucking cocksucker,
get your money out of your pockets
and put it on the table,
nice and fucking slow.
All right, you fucking prick.
All right, now you.
Put it on the fucking table,
nice and fucking slow.
Stop fucking looking at me.
Hands up!
Not you yet.
Get your fucking hands up!
Get your fucking hands
out of your pocket!
Now there's two ways we can do this.
The easy way and the hard way.
Easy way is
do what these guys are doing.
Hard way is make us come around,
which is gonna make him nervous.
You can act
like you haven't got it in your sock,
but me and my nervous friend are
gonna come around and make sure.
The guys that didn't remember
everything,
we're gonna
knock their fucking teeth out.
How's that?
Good. That's the way I feel too.
All right, the less guys that get hurt,
the better, so don't fuck around.
Just keep quiet and give it all up
and nobody gets hurt.
- It's only money.
<i>- Good evening.</i>
<i>This is an extraordinary
period for America's economy.</i>
<i>Over the past weeks,
many Americans have felt anxiety</i>
<i>about their finances and their future.</i>
<i>I understand their worry
and their frustration.</i>
<i>We've seen triple-digit swings
in the stock market.</i>
- All right, do it.
<i>- Major financial institutions</i>
<i>have teetered on the edge
of collapse and some have failed.</i>
<i>As uncertainty has grown,
many banks have restricted lending,</i>
<i>credit markets have frozen,</i>
<i>and families and businesses
have found it harder to borrow money.</i>
<i>We're in the midst
of a serious financial crisis,</i>
<i>and the federal government
is responding with decisive action.</i>
<i>We boosted confidence
in money market mutual funds.</i>
<i>I know many Americans
have questions tonight.</i>
<i>How did we reach this point
in our economy?</i>
<i>How will the solution I propose work?</i>
<i>And what does this mean
for your financial future?</i>
<i>These are good questions,
and they deserve good answers.</i>
<i>First...</i>
Go, go. Go, go, go.
They told me when they heard
that if Dillon wasn't available,
that I was supposed to talk
to the fella he sent. Is that you?
I don't see nobody else who
might be here to meet you. Do you?
Get out from under the construction.
Bang a right and go a couple blocks.
<i>Republicans we know don't like this bill,</i>
<i>and President Bush, I mean,</i>
<i>he's in the position now
of trying to sway public opinion</i>
<i>and build support for it.</i>
<i>With the situation becoming
more precarious by the day,</i>
<i>I face the choice to step in
with dramatic government action,</i>
<i>or to stand back and allow
the irresponsible actions of some</i>
<i>to undermine the financial security
of all.</i>
<i>- There has been a loss of confidence.</i>
- Left.
<i>Major sectors
of America's financial system</i>
<i>are at risk of shutting down.</i>
<i>The government's
top economic experts warn</i>
<i>that without immediate action
by Congress,</i>
<i>- America could slip into...</i>
- So,
they were concerned when I called
Dillon and Dillon said to see you.
They're very concerned.
How is the fella?
Not good. Saw him yesterday.
He feels like somebody
stuck a knife in his chest.
He won't be able
to handle anything for a while.
He sure can't right now.
Personally, I think the guy
is in very bad shape.
Go under the bridge,
and you can park.
So Mark Trattman's game
was hit a couple of nights ago.
I heard that.
- Yeah, two kids.
- Yeah.
You or Dillon hear anything
about two kids?
We hear lots of things.
I heard they had masks on.
- Correct.
- So maybe they're not kids.
Well, they were dressed like kids,
dungarees.
Smelled like animals, Trattman said.
Trattman said.
Well, Trattman also said that the one
who talked had a voice like a kid's.
Trattman said.
You know, as far as I know,
there's nothing wrong
with Trattman's hearing
or his nose or anything.
No, nothing I've heard about, anyways.
So where do we go from here?
What do you think?
It could have been Trattman.
He could've decided to do it again.
No one would think
he's dumb enough to do it twice.
But I know Markie.
He's not that dumb.
So I figured some other smart guys
knew he did it before.
- For now, it don't matter.
- It doesn't?
We start with Trattman.
We start real good too.
Wait a minute.
- I'll wait a week if you want.
- No, I don't understand.
- I thought you believed him.
- My friend, I do,
but the games are closed, right?
- Grant's Tomb.
- People are losing money.
- A fair inference.
- They don't like to lose money.
We hit Trattman,
get things started up.
Get people back to doing
what they're supposed to.
They wanna find out if he did it first.
It don't make a difference if Trattman
did it or someone did it to Trattman.
If people think he did and he's walking,
you're gonna have kids waiting in line
knock them fucking games over.
They just want you to talk to him.
Talk to him.
What does that mean?
Talk to Trattman, see what he says.
- Talk to him.
- Really talk to him.
A beating?
- How badly they want him beaten?
- Shove him around a little.
Don't hurt him too badly.
They don't want him hurt.
Of course you do.
You guys, you always do that.
- All right.
- Quit shitting me. Stop the bullshit.
- All right, stopped.
- But why?
He gonna fold under questioning?
If he does, they'll kill him.
If he doesn't,
they'll figure he's lying and kill him.
Either way, Markie's dead.
Why put the poor bastard
through a beating?
It's a waste of time, not to mention
an unpleasant experience for Markie.
Just put him out of his misery,
poor bastard.
What's the problem?
It's murder, and they are squeamish.
Oh, for fuck's sake.
- Who's running things?
- You have no idea.
No decision-makers.
I gotta take them by the hand
and walk them slowly through it
like they're retarded children.
- What is it, a committee?
- Total corporate mentality.
Chrissake.
This country is fucked,
I'm telling you.
There's a plague coming.
<i>Today we are taking decisive actions</i>
<i>to protect the U.S. economy.</i>
<i>We regret having to take
these actions.</i>
<i>Today's actions are not
what we ever wanted to do,</i>
<i>but today's actions
are what we must do</i>
<i>to restore confidence
in our financial system.</i>
<i>Today I'm announcing that the treasury
will purchase equity stakes...</i>
It's this grey one
right here on the left.
- That's where he lives?
- Yep.
- Jackie, that prick.
- Jackie's all right.
No, he's a mean little prick.
We gotta deal with Markie's
fucking feelings, not him.
Markie's gonna be OK.
He's gonna make it hard on us.
No, he's not.
Yeah, he will. Fuck.
<i>He insists it has to be done
without meaningful discussion</i>
<i>or debate or any change</i>
<i>short of, you know, an immediate
authorisation for use of financial force.</i>
<i>That is Mr Paulson's plan,
former head of Goldman Sachs.</i>
<i>We should not be rolled
by our Wall Street exec</i>
<i>who is masquerading
as Secretary of the Treasury.</i>
<i>Does this remind anybody
of anything?</i>
<i>Like the rush into Iraq on election eve
a number of years ago?</i>
<i>It's all too familiar.</i>
<i>There need to be consequences,
there needs to be major change.</i>
- Hey.
- Get in the car, Markie.
- For what?
- For what?
Get in the fucking car, Markie.
- Steve, I didn't do nothing.
- You're gonna get in the car.
You know you're gonna get in the car,
so get in the fucking car!
- Barry, open the fucking door.
- Shoot me. Go on, shoot me.
- Fuck you, Markie.
- Get in the car.
- Go on, motherfucker.
- Get in the car.
Get out of the car, Markie.
Please, Steve,
let me talk this over, OK?
Get out of the car now, Markie.
- I didn't do nothing.
- I told you, didn't I?
I told you
he was gonna make it hard.
Why you gotta do this?
This is hard for us too.
- Why you gotta make it hard?
- I didn't do nothing.
Move, Markie.
Fucking little prick,
get the fuck out of the car.
- Get out of the car, Markie.
- Come on!
He's not speaking fucking Chinese.
Come on, Trattman. Let's go.
Close the fucking door.
Move over here.
Move down there, down there.
By the door.
Jesus fucking Christ.
May my mother get cancer,
I had nothing to do with this.
You can't tell them that?
I know how it looks. I know.
Honest to God, I didn't.
Oh. Fuck, Barry.
Got fucking blood all over me.
Stop.
- Who are the kids, Markie?
- I don't know. I don't know.
No, I don't know.
You're making this hard
for us, buddy.
Come on, baby. OK.
- No, no, no.
- Markie.
I don't wanna hit your hand.
- Just fucking hit him.
- Turn him around. Right there.
Get his hands, Steven.
No, no, no.
Hey, man. You OK, Markie?
Hey, Markie, you all right?
OK, let's give him a try now.
About the kids, are you sure
you don't know who those kids are?
- You really sure?
- I'm sure.
- I'm sure, Steve.
- Because I gotta be.
I gotta be sure.
You make me stay out here all night,
I'm not gonna like it.
It's gonna be an awful long night
for you, Mark.
You bastard.
You cocksucker!
- What do you say, Steve?
- Shut up.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Fuck.
- Steven.
- What?
Get in the car.
You fucking dirty fucking dog.
Hey, asshole.
Look at you! Look at you!
- How are you?
- Oh, you look fucking ridiculous.
- Who did your hair?
- Fuck you.
What spray shit did you put in it?
I'm not fucking queer.
There's gel on it, you fucking prick.
- You sure you're not a little queer?
- Guy that cut it gave me stuff.
- Oh, look at this. New car.
- What the fuck is that?
It's dog shit. Come on, let's go.
Let's go, come on.
I've gotta get home.
You smell like shit.
You're not getting in my car.
You smell like shit too, like gay shit.
Look at this. Everything's going good.
Shut up.
<i>It was beautiful.</i>
<i>Yeah, we leave in the middle
of the night, for fuck's sake.</i>
<i>All the way to Florida,
we're in this fucking rainstorm.</i>
<i>Dogs are all pissing
and farting and shitting.</i>
<i>And we can't roll the windows down.
We don't wanna drown.</i>
Put the fucking window...
You asshole.
What the fuck, man?
Put the fucking cigarette out.
It was awful.
It was like riding in a shithouse.
And then after we go over to Orlando,
we're gonna burn the car.
So Kenny sticks a rag in the gas tank,
and he lights it up.
You're gonna need
to get a stick. Don't do it by hand.
- You're a fucking pussy.
- Don't do it by hand.
I've done it a million fucking times.
It's fine. It goes up
like a fucking bonfire. I love it.
See?
Oh, fuck.
Kenny, he didn't have
no eyebrows left,
not much hair,
and no sense of humour either.
You know, I thought dogs was gonna
be an easy way to make money.
I was half right.
You look all beat to shit.
Yeah. And the thing of it is,
I've been up for a week, right,
and I gotta keep going
until I finish this thing off.
- What, you haven't dumped the stuff?
- Dumped it?
Christ, no. I haven't stepped it yet.
Look, I put it to a guy fast,
I'm gonna get no more than 15 or 16.
I take it up a step,
I can move it to two guys for 25.
- Russell, it's stupid.
- It's fucking stupid.
That's 1000 dollars a year.
Oh, you're just as dumb as I am.
Maybe you think we were smart doing
that other thing, but we were dumb.
That worked out beautiful.
Oh, sure, fucking cheesecake.
Of course, we got a contract out on us.
But, yeah, beautiful.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Huh?
The fuck you talking about?
Russell?
Russell?
Hey.
What the fuck you talking about?
There's a contract on us,
you, me, and the Squirrel.
I'm gonna be as dead as you guys
if I hang around here.
I'm going to Montreal.
For what?
Hey. For what?
- For what?
- Cut the shit, for the Trattman game.
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
- Russell, Trattman's practically dead.
They beat him shitless. Huh?
You didn't know that, did you?
Of course I did. Kenny told me.
Kenny?
Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?
Hey, Russell,
is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?
Russell, wake up!
- What'd you say?
- Is this Kenny Gill we're talking about?
Yeah.
Russell, Kenny Gill works for Dillon.
Kenny Gill works for Dillon!
- So?
- So you're talking to a fucking guy
that works for fucking Dillon.
So fucking what?
What else did you tell him?
What did you tell him, in case Kenny
didn't get the whole story before?
I didn't say shit.
Now, aside from Squirrel,
we got the kids, two kids.
One of them is the motor mouth.
Drove to Florida with Kenny,
Kenny Gill,
our Kenny,
guy he knows works for Dillon.
Bragging how he's a big-time operator,
knocked over this guy's game for 100K.
- You serious?
- I don't know what it is.
They can't keep their mouth shut
about nothing.
- And Kenny... Kenny's just as dumb.
The way I found out was, this guy's
investing his money in smack.
Wants Kenny to come in with him.
Kenny wants to know
what I think about that.
These guys, they just wanna go to jail.
Probably feel at home there.
So you wanna move now,
or you wanna wait, what?
- I talked to Dillon. We both think now.
- OK.
Whack Trattman,
get the games started.
What brings Trattman into this?
You just told me that it was this
Squirrel fella and his two friends.
It is, plus I had Trattman talked to.
I'm sure.
Your boys went a little overboard there.
Damn near killed the man.
Wasn't my idea. Waste of time, I said.
Why put Markie through it, I said.
He called me.
I had trouble understanding him.
I had trouble calling him back.
He got my secretary the first time.
She couldn't understand him,
the numbers he left.
- He's got a broken jaw.
- I heard that.
Broken ribs, a broken nose,
three or four broken teeth.
There's some question
about his spleen, he said.
He was in the hospital
when I talked to him.
- He's out now.
- Must be his spleen's OK then.
- You know, he's not happy, though.
- I'm sorry to hear. We aim to please.
- That's what I tell them?
- Tell them whatever.
Won't make a difference.
Trattman's gotta be hit.
You know, you see, uh, I don't...
I don't understand that.
- I mean...
- Do I have to explain this twice?
- What do the guys on the street think?
- I got no idea.
They think... They think Trattman.
He did it before, he did it again.
All he got was beat up.
But he didn't really do anything.
It's his responsibility.
He did it before, it happened again.
He's responsible for what guys think.
On the street, it's Trattman,
nothing but Trattman.
Look, there's no two ways about it,
Counsellor.
Trattman's gotta be hit.
He made a mistake.
Wait a minute. I get it.
I see what you mean.
The public angle and all.
OK. OK.
OK, um,
if they agree with you,
assuming that, um,
can you hit Trattman?
Sure.
What about this Squirrel fella?
Because he seems like
the leading candidate to me.
Probably not.
I need Mickey for that one.
Mickey? New York Mickey?
Why can't you handle?
Because Squirrel knows me.
Didn't I say that already?
He needed something done once.
Dillon couldn't, so I did it.
He knows me.
He's gonna figure
if he's waiting on someone,
he's waiting on me or Dillon.
So what?
- You ever killed anyone?
- No.
It can get touchy-feely.
Touchy-feely?
Emotional, not fun, a lot of fuss.
They cry, they plead, they beg,
they piss themselves,
they call for their mothers.
It gets embarrassing.
I like to kill them softly.
From a distance,
not close enough for feelings.
Don't like feelings.
Don't think about them.
We need Mickey.
What's the problem?
- Mickey is expensive.
- Not at the moment.
- You get him for ten?
- Fifteen.
- He'd do it for 15?
- Fifteen, asshole.
In this economy,
a quick 15 for two days work
would sound pretty good to Mickey.
We'll sell him a party.
Fly in, whack a guy, fly out.
Quick 15.
Fly coach.
<i>America's financial system
is intricate and complex.</i>
<i>But behind all the technical
terminology is a critical human factor.</i>
<i>Confidence.</i>
<i>Confidence in our financial systems
is essential</i>
<i>to the smooth operation
of our economy,</i>
<i>and recently that confidence
has been shaken.</i>
<i>All of us have
a responsibility to solve this crisis</i>
<i>because it affects the financial
well-being of every single American.</i>
<i>The House of Representatives
failed to act on Monday</i>
<i>and we saw the single largest decline
in the stock market in two decades.</i>
<i>But in the end of the day,
there's no real separation</i>
<i>between Wall Street
and Main Street.</i>
<i>There's only the road
we're travelling on as Americans</i>
<i>and we will rise or fall on that journey
as one nation, as one people.</i>
Hey, come here.
<i>So where'd you have to go
for these?</i>
Sir?
I said, where did you have to go
for these?
Out of the building, right, huh?
You have to walk a couple blocks,
take a cab?
No, sir, we only have one man on
service today, and he's very busy.
- Are the drinks all right?
- No, they're mostly evaporated
- by the time you get here.
- The drinks are all right.
- Bring me another one.
- Yes, sir.
You mind if I drink that beer
while I wait for Lurch to get back
from the airport over here?
- Make you fat, I thought you said.
- Yeah.
Ahh...
They grabbed me down in Maryland
on this gun thing.
What gun thing?
Well, I was going hunting,
for chrissake.
Me and this guy, Topper.
You know Topper?
- No.
- Nice guy.
We were going down
to Maryland to hunt geese
down the Maryland shore.
Then we go down there
and all of a sudden
there's cops all over the place
and I got the shotgun in the trunk.
Fucking beautiful, hm?
Shotgun.
I just bought the fucking shotgun.
I never even used it once.
Now, boom, I'm under arrest.
Felony possession. So I might
go to jail for a fucking shotgun
I bought in a store to hunt geese with,
for chrissake.
Jesus.
Did you bring him a beer?
No, sir, you only wanted the one,
I thought.
- What?
- You only wanted one drink, I thought.
I'm drinking his beer.
- Get him a beer.
- I don't want another one.
It's all right.
All right, don't have no more.
- So, Topper...
- You're hitting that
pretty hard, aren't you, Mickey?
I can handle it.
So, Topper, yeah, Topper,
he feels responsible and,
you know, he's an old guy.
He hasn't been pinched
in about 30 years,
so we figure
the shotguns are gonna be his.
I'm just doing the old man a favour
driving him down there and all.
Yeah, but if they don't...
I do time.
If the shotguns aren't his, I do time.
It's that simple.
Done it before.
I can do it again.
Rough on the wife, though.
Yeah.
The last time, she actually
took out the papers.
Ah, I didn't blame her.
She's been through it twice before.
The papers come up.
I was gonna sign them.
Let her have what she wants if that's
what she wants. Don't owe me nothing.
But I asked her to come up.
I says, "Margie, do this for me.
Don't do nothing now."
"Do like when I come out the last time
and decide then."
She looks at me. She says,
"And you promised me then."
"You promised me then you were
through, and here I am again."
"I'll wait five more years,
and I'll be five more years older."
"And you're gonna get out again
and you're gonna do something else."
And I said, "Margie, I mean,
what can I say? You're right."
"You're right, but all I'm asking you
to do is wait till I come out again."
Because I don't know who the guy is,
but I did.
I did.
I knew she was seeing somebody.
I knew two days
after she was with him the first time
and I didn't like the feeling it gave me
in my nuts knowing it.
But I didn't blame her.
Anyway, I said, "Margie,
you ought to do this for me."
"I ought to be around, the same as him,
because you and me,
we always got along all right."
Then she started... She started crying
and shaking her head and...
I thought, you know...
But she didn't.
And it was all right.
You're not having any more.
You'll fall on your ass if you do.
I was drinking before you got out
of your father's cock.
Don't tell me what I do.
Next time, you know,
she takes out the papers,
I'm just gonna sign them
'cause it's too fucking rough on me.
Cheque.
Terrible amount of shit
you gotta go through.
What are you gonna do, huh?
Do the best you can.
Am I gonna leave the country
like some draft dodger?
Fuck that.
Besides, none of this shit
means anything anyway.
It's all bullshit.
So, what are we doing?
Huh?
We got two guys.
There's four guys, but it takes forever
to get the OK around here.
So we got two guys for sure, and one
of them knows me, so here you are.
You want me to do
a double or what?
Wanna take the double?
It's all right with me. You need that?
I ought to take you up on it, but I'm
not supposed to be up here, you know.
I'm restricted to New York
and Maryland and all that shit.
If I wanna go anywhere,
I'm supposed to ask.
Well, I didn't ask them.
So I probably shouldn't be up here
any more than I have to, you know.
Besides, a double's risky.
- No, I'll just take the one.
- OK.
Now, here's the thing. That's gonna be
the guy that knows me.
The other guy I'm doing.
Put his light out tonight
if everything goes right.
Fuck.
What are we gonna do, Jackie?
Never mind what I'm gonna do.
Think about what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna make some money, right?
Five hundred, same as always. Five
hundred, you don't fuck anything up.
When did I fuck anything up?
The world's full of guys that
never fuck up, then they fuck up.
Now they're doing time.
Tonight's not the night to start,
not when I'm with you.
I never fucked anything up.
- Where's the car?
- Around the side...
- Move your big ass. He's going home.
- I don't get it.
Yeah, neither does he tonight.
Never again, either.
Come on. I wanna get home early
for a change.
Put the dollar back. Put it back.
For fuck's sake.
<i>America has the most talented,
productive,</i>
<i>and entrepreneurial workers
in the world.</i>
Ride up easy, nice and smooth.
Right up next to him, Kenny.
A little bit ahead.
Put me right up next to him.
<i>The first one, she wasn't bad.</i>
She wasn't good, but she wasn't bad.
She was all right.
She seemed like she was in
an awful hurry.
Honey, could you zip me up?
No.
- I thought you were kidding.
- No. Get your trick to do it.
Screwing's no different
than anything else.
Nobody gives a good shit anymore.
Hire somebody to do something,
tell them you're willing to pay for it.
They say they'll do it, and they have to.
For a guy who's been having himself
a party for three days,
you bitch and moan a lot.
I've been paying for it.
I can bitch about it if I want.
So you know this broad Polly?
- Honey?
- Huh?
Oh, it's on the nightstand.
The wallet's on the nightstand.
Yeah, everybody knows Polly.
That's what the first broad
you sent said.
There's $283 in there, OK?
When I get up, I wanna see $183
in there, got that?
OK. No tip?
No tip.
- You're the original sport.
- Fuck her.
You want a tip? I'll give you a tip.
Put the condom on with your mouth
and you stop acting like your anus
is a national treasure.
- You're a hooker for chrissake.
- Fuck you.
Whoa.
Let me tell you something.
One day,
one old bastard that you milked,
he's gonna carve you up
talking like that.
How would you like that?
Jesus, I don't know.
You think I'd come?
If you could, maybe you would.
But I'm thinking no.
Fuck you.
Which is what I had in mind
when she come up here.
You know, I haven't had a real
piece of ass since Florida.
- Sunny.
- Sunny.
Yeah.
You probably fucked her too,
after I left.
Mickey. When me and Dillon
got there, she was with you.
When we left, she was still with you.
You were there, what?
- Three weeks.
- Three weeks.
I was there five days in the middle.
How the fuck am I gonna do that?
I don't know.
Ahh... Empty again.
You sure you won't join me?
Not late enough yet either.
Sammy fucked her.
Guy from Detroit,
sharp-looking little ginzo?
He's a fucking Jew.
All those years I knew that guy,
he fucking did it anyway.
Scumbag.
Son of a bitch.
Ah... I don't know
why I care about this.
I mean, you know, I know when
I'm there, I'm there, she's with me.
And when I leave and you're there,
she's with you.
She wasn't with me.
I don't mean you. I mean any guy.
Oh.
Ah, I don't care.
It's not like I love her or nothing.
I just give her for when I'm there.
Fucking Sammy.
Mickey.
She's good, you know, Sunny.
She's a good girl.
If she can't get you up,
you're probably dead.
And let me tell you something.
I've seen every kind of ass
there is in this world.
You've seen it this week.
You been here three days?
I hear you've seen
most of the ass in town.
Well, I like it. It's, like, my hobby.
I couldn't fuck like that for three days.
I get all fucked out.
You want ass?
There's no ass in the whole world
like a young Jewish girl
that's hooking.
I'm gonna keep that in mind.
You take that to the bank.
First time I met Sunny,
she walked in the room,
I got a fucking enormous hard-on.
I could have fought five guys with
this fucking prong I had.
So fucking hard,
the skin from under my eyes
just kind of went down
into the cock so it could expand.
- Mickey.
- I just wanted to fuck her so bad.
- She was so fucking beautiful.
- Mickey.
- I felt like a man.
- Mick!
She made me feel good. What?
You gonna be all right...
...tomorrow night, the next?
I'm all right now. What the fuck?
Leave me alone.
This after,
we're supposed to meet a guy.
I got a guy
to take you around and all.
I can't go out.
What the fuck are you talking about?
No, I can't go out. Can't.
You come up here to do something,
remember? For that.
All right, go get him.
Go get the fucking guy
and we'll set this thing up.
Go get him! We'll set the thing up!
- Go get him!
- You.
I tell you what you're gonna do.
Go to bed.
It's 2.30 now, you shit.
I call you at 7.30. If I don't wake you,
I am gonna drop a dime
on a couple cops who are gonna take
you where you're supposed to be.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. No ass. No more booze.
No nothing.
Get yourself a shower and go to bed.
I'll tell you where you gotta be.
I don't take orders
from shits like you!
7.30. Get some sleep.
He's been here three days.
What he didn't fuck in them three days,
he drank.
He was drunk when I left him.
2.00 in the afternoon and he's drunk.
When I chew him out, he's gonna go
out in his skivvies and do the job now.
- Won't fucking shut up.
- You asked for him.
You couldn't do it,
so we got you what you asked for.
I need the Mickey from years ago.
He's fucking worthless now.
Did you talk to Dillon about it?
Is he able to talk to anybody?
Dillon thinks what I think.
We need this guy out of town.
You invited him here. Send him back.
Won't go. He needs the dough.
Well, I can't
get in touch with him today.
It's not like that.
What I got in mind,
I'm gonna get him grabbed.
Won't he talk?
If he thought it was me who did it,
he might.
In a day from now, he's gonna get
in a fight with a whore
in a hotel
that don't like whore fights.
He's gonna get busted for that.
They revoke his bail, back he'll go.
Kind of rough on him.
Actually,
I think it's the best thing for him.
Won't get enough potato jack
in the can to kill him.
If he's not in the can,
he's gonna kill us.
- How much is the girl gonna cost?
- Five hundred, maybe a grand.
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's a grand.
I still gotta OK it. All this running
back to them with the latest bad news,
- they're raising hell with me.
- We got a problem.
We weren't supposed to have any
little problems, no problems at all.
Please don't smoke in my car.
Please, come on.
Looks like our boy finally made it.
I've got him now.
He's about to enter the building.
All units, this is Unit 3.
He's headed to the lockers
on the west side.
You have the right to remain silent.
You have any guns, knives,
needles, or anything I'll get stuck on?
- I don't know, maybe.
- What?
- Yeah. Left jacket pocket.
- Yes or no?
You have the right to talk
to a lawyer before we ask you questions.
Don't move that hand.
Don't move that hand.
Do you understand
what I've just read to you, sir?
That poor bastard. You know,
I knew this was gonna happen.
I told him, you know.
What the fuck, you know.
You know, I like the guy.
He was always all right to me,
and now I can't do nothing to help him.
Took his chances.
Sure, John, and you take your chances
and I take my chances.
And sooner or later,
they're gonna grab us.
Yeah, and then who am I gonna call,
you know, you?
I haven't got no friends either.
Look at it. You, me and Russell
are in the same position.
- He's in it now and we're not in it yet.
- Frankie, you gotta relax.
It's like Trattman.
It come out just like you said.
When it didn't happen
and Russell was telling me that stuff,
I was scared it wasn't gonna happen.
I thought it was gonna happen to me.
That don't mean... Well, yeah, I mean,
I'm glad it happened to him.
But I still wish
it didn't even happen to him.
It didn't have to.
It's just shit, you know.
This world is just shit.
We're all just on our own.
What the fuck, man!
What you gonna do?
Get off my block, bitch!
This is my block!
I run this motherfucking block!
Get off my block!
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?
I run this show! I run this show!
What you gonna do, homey?
Get off my fucking block, man!
Get off my block!
<i>Our eye now is to the future,</i>
<i>to shine the bright light
of accountability...</i>
- Can I get you a Bud?
- Uh, yeah.
- Bottle or draft?
- I don't give a shit.
<i>That accountability will tell us
how we got to this place...</i>
- They always do that.
- Pain in the ass.
Wouldn't come in I knew
I gotta go through shit like that.
Shit, I would.
This guy, I don't know how he does it.
He must have the best-built girls
in town working for him.
- I come in here every day.
- I know.
I've never seen you in here before.
- Look, I don't know you.
- Very few guys know me.
I've never been here before
in my life.
I was looking for you.
A guy told me you come in here a lot
around this time of the day,
so I came in.
Simple.
Oh. Who's the guy?
The guy? A friend.
A friend of yours, actually.
Well, who is the friend?
A friend. Your friends are worried
about you, Frankie.
They think you need somebody around
who knows about things. Advise you.
Teach you how to cover your ass.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
See, it's not so much
what you've been doing.
It's what guys
think you've been doing.
And that's what you
gotta look out for.
And when it happens,
you gotta be prepared
to do something.
Yeah.
So where's
he gonna be tomorrow night?
Who?
Johnny Amato.
Tomorrow night,
where's he gonna be?
- Ahem. I... I don't know.
- Frank.
You gotta keep in mind
what I told you.
Your friends are worried about you.
Your friends wanna see you get
a second chance. Know what I mean?
It's your friends that wanna know
where Squirrel's gonna be.
Yeah, well,
I don't know who the fuck you are.
Very few guys do.
Well, Dillon, maybe.
Yeah, Dillon knows me.
Yeah.
You want me to call Dillon for you
so you can talk to Dillon
and see who I am?
No.
OK, then, where's he gonna be?
I haven't got no idea.
OK.
See you around, Frankie, my friend.
- No, no, hey, wait a minute.
- Fuck you, I don't get paid to wait.
You tell me you don't know, OK.
I accept that.
But I got something to do.
I gotta find a guy who does know.
Where John's gonna be
tomorrow night?
Yeah. There's something else now,
I guess.
Like where
you're gonna be the day after.
Except you're in a position
very few guys ever get in.
You can do something about it.
You have choices.
I've known very few guys
in a position like that.
Kid, I hope you don't think
I'm shitting you.
Kid, I hate to see you go like this.
- And you're going for fucking nothing.
- Jesus, look, I... I can't do this, like...
Let me ask you something.
You think about this.
You think I was to go to Wollaston
and see him there now and I was to say,
"Squirrel, it's you or Frankie,
who's it gonna be?"
You think he'd even think twice
about it? You think he would?
- I... I don't know.
- Asshole.
Fucking asshole.
It's no wonder you did time.
- Look, I...
- I know what's going on.
What I gotta do.
I gotta find the right guy.
Make the pick. I'm gonna do you
a favour. I'm not gonna do you a favour.
- It don't matter to me.
- Let me think.
No, no thinking. Go or no go.
Right now. I gotta get going.
Fucking Jesus. Look,
I don't know if I can do this, you know.
Can you do the other thing?
No.
OK. So I guess you know, then.
That's the selection.
All right.
So, what? What do I gotta do?
You gotta find out
where Johnny's gonna be.
- I already know.
- Yeah?
He... He's got a girl.
You know, he told me that before.
OK, and where you gonna be?
I... I told him I'd be home,
I'd be home.
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?
- No.
- Where?
You're gonna be with me.
We're gonna be where he's gonna be.
Jesus, look, I can't do that.
If he sees me, it's all over.
He's gonna know something's wrong.
I... I can't do that.
- I'll tell you...
- OK, OK.
That's... So you made the other choice,
then, I guess.
Have I really gotta do that?
All of it?
I gotta be there and everything?
Frank, you made a mistake,
and you gotta show
you understand you made a mistake.
And you gotta make things right.
Otherwise they're gonna want someone
to do something like with Trattman.
Never did the right thing.
Jack, he's not a bad guy, you know.
I mean, he's not a bad guy at all.
None of them are, kid.
They're all nice guys.
He was always all right to me.
Sure, got you six years
in the fucking slammer.
That wasn't his fault.
Kid, when somebody does something
and gets somebody else jail for it,
- it's his fault. That's the rule.
- Well, he didn't mean it.
That's got nothing to do with it.
Nothing at all.
- That them?
- No, John's got a Caddy.
I know what he's got.
I want to know is that them?
Nope. I'd have said it if it was.
I think you got him all wrong.
That jail thing.
He had it worse than I did,
with his family and everything.
He's never gonna have to do it again.
That's him.
I'm not sure.
Yes, you are.
How long is he gonna be, kid?
I don't know.
OK, I asked you nice.
Now, does he fuck her here
or does he fuck her someplace else?
She's got a roommate.
He knows a guy
that's got a motel down in Haverhill.
OK.
It's just gonna be friendly then.
No, I was gonna get it started and
everything so we could have a start.
There's probably gonna be a lot
of noise, and I've known guys,
heard noise, got too good a start
and left somebody standing
with their thumb up their ass.
Fuck, fuck.
Oh, fuck.
Give me that start, kid.
Kid, you're going too fast.
They're gonna have
all kinds of cops in here.
And one of them's gonna catch you.
Slow down.
Kid.
- Kid, slow down.
- I can't.
Kid, you got to. Slow the fuck down.
Kid, my car's in Primrose.
We got a long way to go.
Just slow the fuck down.
You wanna fucking drive?
- Know what you gotta do?
- Sure.
I go to car, I leave this one,
and I go home.
Just leave it?
Christ, I wipe it down.
You gonna be all right
and everything?
Yeah, I'm gonna be fucking fine.
Where's your car parked again?
Oh, for chrissake,
it's in a lot down on Brentwood.
OK, just making sure.
Sometimes guys forget.
Yeah, I fucking got it.
- You gonna remember now?
- I know, I know.
I dump the fucking car
and I don't go too fast
and I wear my fucking seat belt.
<i>It's the answer

Ah, yes, we're all the same.
We're all equal.
<i>That we have never been
just a collection of individuals</i>
<i>or a collection
of red states and blue states.</i>
<i>We are and always will be
the United States of America.</i>
Next he'll be telling us
we're a community. We're one people.
<i>In this country, we rise or fall
as one nation, as one people.</i>
Had yourself quite a party.
I do the best I can. Beer.
So everything is under control,
I take it, at long last?
For someone I'm trying to help out,
you're awful hard to get along with.
Could have made you drive up to see me.
I have to come down here.
- I'm trying to be nice to you.
- You're trying to be nice to me?
Sure, I'm a nice guy.
I like to make things easy on people,
do people favours now and then.
Do me a favour:
Don't do me any favours.
I see how you work.
Tell you what,
just give me the money.
- Excuse me.
- Are you gonna count it?
I gotta take a leak. Let me alone.
Have another ginger ale.
<i>For those watching tonight

<i>Yes, we can! Yes, we can!</i>
<i>Yes, we can! Yes, we can!</i>
<i>Yes, we can!</i>
- Feel better?
- No.
There's only 30 in there.
Three guys. I had to ask them
if I should pay you for the kid.
- But, you know, they said I should.
- They were right to.
But that's only ten apiece.
- Correct.
- The price is 15.
Dillon charges ten.
Recession prices.
They told me to tell you that too.
You made a deal with Mickey for 15.
Yeah, but the way they got it,
Mickey got in a fight with a whore,
the dumb shit,
and now they got him in the can.
And you're filling in for Dillon
and you get what Dillon gets, no more.
You talk to Dillon. Take it up with him.
Dillon's dead.
Dillon died this morning.
Well...
- They're gonna be sorry to hear that.
- Sure, sure, they are.
It's gonna cost them more.
This business is a business
of relationships.
Yeah, and everyone loved Markie.
You are a cynical bastard,
you know that?
<i>To reclaim the American dream</i>
<i>and reaffirm that fundamental truth</i>
<i>that out of many, we are one.</i>
You hear that line? Line's for you.
Don't make me laugh.
We're one people.
It's a myth
created by Thomas Jefferson.
Now you're gonna have a go
at Jefferson, huh?
My friend,
Jefferson's an American saint
because he wrote the words,
"All men are created equal."
Words he didn't believe, since he
allowed his children to live in slavery.
He was a rich snob who was sick
of paying taxes to the Brits.
He wrote some lovely words
and aroused the rabble.
They went and died for those words
while he sat and drank his wine
and fucked his slave girl.
This guy wants to tell me
we're living in a community.
Don't make me laugh.
I'm living in America, and in America,
you're on your own.
America's not a country.
It's just a business.
Now fucking pay me.
