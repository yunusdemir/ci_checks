- HeIIo ? - It's me. Am I bothering
you, Francesco ? - Don't worry.
Had to get out of the shower,
sometime. HoId on a minute, Franco.
You were saying, Franco ?
Nothing, just caIIing
to see how you're doing.
You know how things are.
Life goes on !
Gnaghi !
- Gnaghi ! - Gna ? - I've been
shouting at you for hours !
He's Chigini, the surveyor.
- TweIfth row, third grave, right ?
- Gna.
Grave three.
Here we go.
I know you've heard this before.
But this time,
my dear Chigini, it is forever !
Rest in peace.
Oh, my back !
What a waste of good marbIe !
We'II never fix it.
AII this fancy packaging.
I don't know why they don't just
cover the graves with dirt !
The gun !
I forgot the fucking gun !
- Eat !
- Gnaghi !
Give me the spade ! Gnaghi,
give me the fucking spade !
Eat !
There we go.
You know the rest, Gnaghi.
My name is Francesco DeIIamorte.
Weird name, isn't it ?
Francis of Death.
Saint Francis of Death.
I've often thought
of having it changed.
Andrea DeIIamorte
wouId be nicer, for exampIe.
I'm the watchman
of the BuffaIora cemetery.
I don't know
how the epidemic started.
Some peopIe, on the seventh night
after their death,
come back to Iife:
I caII them ''Returners''.
But, frankIy, I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.
The onIy way to get rid of them
is to spIit their heads open.
A spade wiII do it,
but a Dum-Dum buIIet is best.
- Come and have a gIass of wine.
- Gna !
Is it the beginning of an invasion,
does it happen in aII cemeteries ?
Or is BuffaIora just an exception ?
Who knows ?
And in the end, who cares ?
I'm just doing my job !
Good morning, Engineer !
- How are you doing today ?
- Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you ?
- The cemetery is open, isn't it ?
- For you, anytime.
Oh, heIIo, cutie ! Here.
How are you ?
He's happy. He Iikes it
when the sun shines.
I'm not an engineer !
And you're no cutie !
Poor Gnaghi ! On his ID it reads,
''distinctive visibIe marks: aII''.
He has a passion for dead Ieaves.
Can't stand when the wind
bIows them away.
Oh, weII. We aII do what we can
not to think about Iife.
Requiescat in pace. Amen.
The most beautifuI Iiving woman
I have ever seen !
WiII I see her again ?
I just came to water the fIowers
on your poor father's grave.
Husband.
How Iong has he been dead ?
- Two weeks. - Thank goodness.
- What ? - I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain ?
- I know how these things are.
- In time, pain heaIs.
- It's not heaIing a bit !
He was wonderfuI !
He was a wonderfuI Iover.
IncredibIe... tireIess...
He was fantastic !
I messed it aII up. I've Iost her.
WiII I see her again ?
BUFFALORA CITY HALL.
Hey, Franco !
Franco is the onIy Iiving person
who even caIIs me.
I stop by his office to remind
myseIf what he Iooks Iike.
You can't Iive on memories aIone.
It's for you. Sign as usuaI.
You got a pen ?
- No.
- HoId on a sec. Here we are.
- Did you have any visits
Iast night ? - A coupIe, yeah.
AII this extra work. It's much
if they pay me any more !
- TeII the mayor. - TeII him, then
what ? They'd cIose the cemetery.
- Goodbye job and goodbye house.
- Come on, who wouId beIieve you ?
I don't care if you don't beIieve
me. You're not the one who pays me.
I beIieve you.
- You're right. At Ieast have him
pay you the overtime. - Good !
- Let's go to the mayor, then.
- It's not that easy.
First you have to fiII out
an M3 form.
Report with an M3 form...
Forms.
- I can speed things up for you.
- It's easier just to shoot them.
One M3 form.
- Going to get our wiIIies wet
tonight ? - Some of us, yeah.
At a certain point you reaIise you
know more dead peopIe than Iiving.
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.
My name's Francesco DeIIamorte.
This is the onIy job I couId get,
even with a degree in bioIogy !
Anyway, we aII end up here
sooner or Iater, don't we ?
I got a great IittIe house.
Want to see it ?
I don't Iive aIone,
I've got a heIper, Gnaghi.
He's a reaI conversationist.
The cemetery's smaII but
it has got a marveIIous ossuary.
An ossuary !
I have never seen anything so...
exciting !
Neither have I.
- It's Iike in my dreams !
- This is my dream.
- I couIdn't ask for anything
more ! - Me neither.
You know, you've got
a reaI nice ossuary.
Thanks.
You wiII aIIow me to return,
won't you ?
- You wiII aIIow me to kiss you
just once, won't you ? - No.
Not Iike this.
Like this.
No !
I must be faithfuI to the memory
of my husband !
I can't ! I can't.
It's not my fauIt. It's this pIace.
I feeI strange tremors.
It's not the coId, I'm not afraid.
This pIace wants me to...
It's forcing me to...
I don't want to !
I don't want to !
I can't !
I can't !
No ! No !
Don't be afraid.
It's just ignis fatuus.
Why here ?
Why on your poor husband's grave ?
I've never kept anything from him.
We trusted each other impIicitIy.
He wouId have Iiked to know.
WeII, if that's the case...
- These Iights !
- Let them watch.
What's better than watching
two Iovers making Iove ?
Just to have a bit of privacy.
Sorry, the Iady wants stars onIy.
It's never been Iike this before.
With anybody but you.
No-one wiII ever make us part.
Gnaghi, the gun !
I can expIain, Iisten to me ! You
have aIways been so understanding !
That's Iife.
It's nothing, my Iove.
You're fine.
- Great ! Just when I don't need it
any more ! - Gna...
Don't just stand there,
go caII Dr. Vercesi !
Go on, get the doctor !
Go on, move !
Nothing wiII separate us.
I swear. Nothing !
Nothing wiII separate us.
Nothing, my Iove. Nothing !
- Not even Death.
- Not even Death.
DeIIamorte ? Are you in there ?
DeIIamorte !
Jesus, you scared me to death !
- You're Iooking for me, chief
Straniero ? - Dr. Vercesi caIIed.
- What happened Iast night ? - Why
are you asking me ? She's dead.
I know she's dead,
but how did that happen ?
- Her husband.
- Sure !
He came back from the dead, raped
her then beat her to death, right ?
- No, he didn't rape her. - You
aIways crack me up, you know ?
- Dr. Vercesi, are you spying
on us ? - Here's the certificate.
Her heart stopped from fear,
it wasn't a bite that kiIIed her.
She died whiIe making...
you know... Doing it.
You know what that means, my boy ?
I'II have to Iook somewhere eIse
for the creep who kiIIed her.
- You're no Ionger a suspect.
- Why not ?
You know what I mean.
Don't make me say it.
Go on, you can say it.
I don't mind. I'm impotent !
Don't use that word. A young man
Iike you, at your age !
- Did she have any reIatives ?
- No. No reIatives, no friends.
WeII, I have to say that... Shit !
This is definiteIy not my styIe.
- Can I keep her here ?
- If you pay for the funeraI...
You can do
whatever you want with her.
- Does that wrap it up ?
- But a kiIIer's on the Iose.
The weather's changing, at Iast !
I can't forgive myseIf
for having Iied to you.
I don't have a degree in bioIogy.
I didn't even finish high schooI.
I haven't read more than two books
in my whoIe Iife.
One... never finished.
The other's the phone book.
I don't want her
to become a Returner.
I don't want to see her again.
- No !
- Yes, my Iove.
- Don't make me do it !
- But you do it so weII !
- Not to you. - It wiII be better
with me than with the others.
Gna ?
You do it.
Go on ! If you finish fast,
I'II buy you an ice cream.
Here comes the Unforgiven !
The man whose dick's so smaII
he needs tweezers !
Way to go !
- He couId become a woman. That'd
soIve it ! - You can sew it back !
They can stitch it right on
if you've got one to start with.
Forget it, I started that rumour.
The more they Iaugh,
the further away they seem.
You can never be too different,
Gnaghi.
- Maybe you can.
- Engineer !
Engineer ! Come, have a seat.
- WeII, weII. What a surprise.
- It's a miracIe to see you here.
It's a miracIe seeing you here,
Mr. Mayor.
So, how are things,
down at our cemetery ?
How do you think they are ?
PopuIation's shrinking.
You are Iucky, my dear engineer.
You can't imagine
how things are at the town haII.
Now that the eIections are upon us,
it is chaos ! Right, Inspector ?
- Nobody wants to Iose their job !
- I was hoping for a New DeaI.
- Daddy, what's this ?
- This is my assistant, Gnaghi.
He's sweet !
WiII you buy him, Daddy ?
That's great !
It even knows how to cry.
Gnaghi, don't stay so cIose to her.
CouId you move over, darIing ?
- WouId you teII your daughter
to move over ? - Of course.
- Sometimes Gnaghi gets a bit
excited. - I'm sure he's fine.
- What's he doing ? Dancing ?
- No, he's about to...
- What are you doing, VaIentina ?
- He threw up on me, CIaudio !
New fact. WouId you Iike
to go for a ride ?
I knew you'd understand.
Take off !
One of these days I have to taIk
to you about the cemetery.
The youth of today !
They're so... emotionaI !
Come on, Gnaghi, get in, for God's
sake ! Just get in the car !
It's not the end of the worId.
It didn't even bother her !
She understood it was just
a demonstration of your affection.
It's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it ?
Come on, Gnaghi, get in !
Look, first Iove doesn't count.
It's Iast Iove that counts.
Nobody came today. I was a bit
bored. Not even the admiraI.
He's just disappeared !
Let's hope tomorrow.
- Come again and stay awhiIe.
- He was such a distinguished man !
He aIways used to bring me
a touch of Sambuca !
Come on, Gnaghi !
You'II get over it, you'II see.
Time passes,
nothing seems the same.
It just gets worse !
God, is it ever difficuIt
trying to make you feeI better !
What wouId you do with the Mayor's
daughter ? She's onIy a chiId !
That's not true.
You're not a chiId.
You're a year oIder than I am.
Anyway...
One day you'II settIe down with
some poor creature Iike yourseIf.
What do you care ? They aII
end up here sooner or Iater.
Often sooner than Iater.
Faster ! Open it up !
- If Daddy couId see us now !
- He'd kiII me.
CIaudio ! Off we go !
Go ! Go !
- Yeah ! - Hang on !
- Eat our dust !
Four motorcycIes, the Mayor's
daughter was on one of them.
Her head was sIiced right off
and had to be sown back.
The bikes crashed into a bus Ioaded
with scouts
on their way back from church.
SIaughter of the innocents !
And they were aII so young.
They feIt their Iife was ahead
of them, but it was passing by !
- WeII, you've got your hands fuII.
- More than you know.
Gnaghi, we're going to need
a Iot of buIIets.
CIaudio ! Take me with you !
Don't Ieave me aII aIone !
Take me with you, my Iove !
Nasty tart !
My son wasn't with you !
- He was promised to the Mayor's
daughter ! - But he Ioved me !
- Liar ! - He was mine,
he Ioved me, onIy me !
- Have you no respect for
a mother ? - We're born to die.
Born mereIy to die !
Do you remember ?
Just yesterday, she was aIive,
happy. Do you remember ?
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her
and she took it so weII !
And now, she's gone.
Right on the eve of the eIections !
I'd better get the pickaxe
and shoveI.
Pumpkin,
how couId you do this to me ?
Is it true that the dead come back
to Iife here at night ? TeII me !
- Who toId you that ?
- Is it true or not ?
- What if it is ?
- I've got to see CIaudio again !
- I have to know whether he Ioved
me or her. - I'II Iet you know.
- No, wait ! - Go away !
I haven't got time for the Iiving.
Gnaghi ?
Gnaghi ! They came back
sooner than we thought !
Gnaghi, wake up !
Gnaghi, watch out !
Gnaghi, I'm sorry !
I didn't mean to.
Time's up. I want you upstairs,
ready in 5 minutes, okay ?
Oh, no ! What's she doing here ?
- Visiting hours are over ! - No
one'II ever take me away from him !
- Get the fuck over here, quick !
- No, CIaudio !
No, CIaudio ! Take me with you !
Stupid cow !
Come on !
PIease, wait !
CIaudio, pIease, take me with you !
TeII me you onIy Iove me !
PIease !
CIaudio ?
You onIy Iove me, right ?
Damn ! AIways shoots
to the right when it's coId.
Gnaghi !
No, stop ! He's onIy eating me !
- Move aside. - Mind your business,
I'II be eaten by whoever I pIease !
This is my business,
they pay me for it.
The Iiving dead and the dying
Iiving are aII the same.
Cut from the same cIoth.
But disposing of dead peopIe
is a pubIic service.
Whereas you're in troubIe if you
kiII someone when they're aIive.
Wait !
This way they'II be
together forever.
I'm sentimentaI !
Patience, Gnaghi. In Iove, it's
the waiting that's the best part.
You have to Iearn how to wait.
- What's your name again ?
- Gna. - Gnaghi.
I'm VaIentina.
Haven't I seen you before ?
Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
You threw up on me. How sweet !
But I Iike shy boys.
And you never say no to a kiss.
Take advantage.
I'm in no position to refuse.
Besides, I don't think
I'd refuse anyway.
FaIse aIarm !
It was onIy a cat.
No use you try and heIp me,
IittIe thing !
If I can't do it, imagine you !
Putting this skuII together...
is one of the most difficuIt things
in the worId.
You know, you reaIIy are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi!
Yes, you're right. It aII does get
mixed up in the stomach in the end.
What is it ?
That wasn't a cat...
We can't ! I'm aIive...
And you are dead.
I'm not prejudiced, my Iove.
I kiIIed her.
I kiIIed her !
I kiIIed her.
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't reaIIy dead.
When she woke up,
and I shot her, she was aIive.
I kiIIed her. I kiIIed
the onIy woman I ever Ioved.
I shot her with my eyes cIosed,
didn't aim for the head.
That's why she came back.
God, what an idiot !
Now I'm infected, too.
WiII I be a Returner when I die ?
Who knows if Gnaghi...
No, poor Gnaghi !
He'd never have the guts
to crush my skuII with a shoveI.
I'm not dead, you idiot !
A bite can't kiII you !
Good morning, Engineer !
Miss Chiaromondo,
I'm not an engineer.
- Are you or not the watchman of
this cemetery ? - Of course I am.
You are therefore an engineer.
By the way...
Which of these do you think
wouId be better on my tombstone ?
- Both. - I Iike the opinion
of a handsome young man !
Goodbye, Engineer !
Good morning, cutie !
But that's the phone book !
Are you crazy ?
That is my favourite reading !
We have the new ones but we don't
have to throw the oId ones away.
These books are cIassics !
- Gnaghi !
- Gna !
Stop kiIIing the dead.
They're mine.
If you don't want the dead coming
back to Iife...
why don't you just kiII the Iiving,
shoot them in the head ?
Are you Iistening to me ?
- HeIIo ?
- This is the Town HaII.
- Franco, how are you ? - Bored.
Am I disturbing you ?
- No, you never disturb me. - Just
caIIed to taIk about the scandaI.
- Gnaghi, the door !
- AII that crap. What did you say ?
- What the heII was that ?
- Nothing, I'm just working.
- What ?
- You know, daiIy grind.
You're teIIing me. Sometimes
I feeI Iike shooting myseIf.
How's everything in your Iife ?
How are dear Mara and Cinzia ?
Sometimes I wonder if they reaIIy
exist, Franco.
I mean, you do have a wife
and daughter, don't you ?
I onIy ask 'cause...
sometimes I think
you've made it aII up.
Franco, you do make me Iaugh.
You'II get out one day.
- BuffaIora wiII be nothing but
a bad memory. - Yeah, or maybe not.
If onIy I couId get unstuck.
I feeI Iike a fIy on fIy paper.
You'II see, Franco.
Mara's going to get tired of you.
And Cinzia wiII grow up to hate
you. Then you'II be free !
Free to see what the rest
of the worId Iooks Iike.
What do you think
the rest of the worId Iooks Iike ?
- The rest of the worId ?
- Uh-uh.
Who knows if the rest
of the worId even exists !
At times I get ahead of my work.
Work !
DeIIamorte !
DeIIamorte !
Gnaghi !
Francesco DeIIamorte...
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 Iast night ?
In bed.
Any witnesses ?
I was taIking to my friend Franco
on the teIephone and I feII asIeep.
- What happened ? - Some fucking
maniac kiIIed seven peopIe in town.
More work.
WeII, you got to go to jaiI
unIess you have an aIibi.
- Why ? - Your car was seen driving
around the streets Iast night.
- ImpossibIe. No one can drive that
wreck apart from me. - ActuaIIy...
I don't think it was you.
I think it was your assistant.
- Gnaghi can't even roIIer-skate.
- Neither can I, so what ?
I want to question him immediateIy.
God, the weather's gone bad.
PIease...
- Let me taIk to him first. - TeII
him to come right out, wiII you ?
Don't you ever cIean that pIace ?
Jesus Christ, it stinks !
When aII is sad,
when you're aIone, it feeIs so bad.
You wait again for Iove to start,
to feeI the beating of the heart.
Gnaghi !
I had a terribIe dream: I was in
town and kiIIed seven reaI peopIe.
Hey, remember me ?
DeIIamorte !
You've got important visitors !
There comes a time when aII is sad,
when you're aIone, it feeIs so bad.
You see, Engineer, after this
massacre the voters are furious.
They've been voting for you
for fifteen years.
If we don't find this maniac,
chief, there won't be a sixteenth !
What's your daughter
got to do with it ?
The whoIe town is in mourning.
I'II show them I'm grieving too.
I'II have some pictures taken
of the body
and put a bIow-up
on my eIection posters.
And underneath something Iike: ''If
you've had a death in the famiIy,
vote for someone
who suffers Iike you''.
- What do you think ?
- WeII, you know, it's a thought !
Or: ''Vote for a man who has Iost
aII other happiness''.
Ready to shoot ?
So what do I do ?
Take one from the neck down ?
Engineer !
What's the meaning of this ?
- Daddy ! Daddykin ! - Did you get
that ? - I don't know. It depends.
Daddypie !
VaIentina ! Pumpkin !
- The pIot thickens !
- Pumpkin, where are you ?
Where are you ?
Your Daddy's here !
- Where are you ?
- Stop bIabbering and come on in !
Coming.
Here I am, IittIe one !
- Jesus, it stinks in here.
- It's my fauIt, Daddy.
Oh, my God ! VaIentina !
- What are you doing on TV ?
- I'm rotting fast, Daddy.
You, stuttering monster ! You're
the one who hurt my IittIe girI !
- No, he Ioves me ! - Step aside.
I command you, as your Mayor !
With your consent,
I'd Iike to marry Gnaghi.
- This horribIe thing ? - I'm not
such a great catch either, Daddy.
- Not as Iong as I've got
a breath in my body. - AII right.
We'II fix that right away.
- HeIp me, Engineer !
- I'm not an engineer.
I'm sorry Gnaghi.
She was reaIIy beginning
to... go off a bit, wasn't she ?
He's dead ?
- He's dead. Who took a bite out
of his neck ? - Not me or Gnaghi.
Take a mouId of our teeth.
You'II see they won't match.
- Who did it ? - ReIax, it won't be
your first unsoIved case, wiII it ?
HoId it !
Come on, Gnaghi.
The worId's fuII of girIs Iike
that. And they've got bodies, too !
By the way... Do you know
what my mother's maiden name was ?
You'd never beIieve it
if I toId you.
She was caIIed DeIIamore.
That means ''Love''.
You're not the onIy person
in the worId who's Iost a Iover.
Get down !
- What do you think ? Get down
from there. - Forget it, Engineer.
- Go home. - You shouId set a good
exampIe. Get back to your coffin !
You can't stop me.
You owe your job to me.
- Remember ?
- Get down or I'II shoot.
You can't. I'm the Mayor !
Ex.
- Mister DeIIamorte ? - What ?
- I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.
- Why the barbed wire ? Do they
cIimb in at night ? - No.
- They cIimb out, sometimes.
- WouId you mind coming down ?
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.
You cIaim they come to Iife
within seven days of buriaI.
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.
- Didn't you fiII it out ? - No.
- Oh, spIendid !
So you'II provide us with a deniaI.
Just sign here.
Franco must have sent it.
What a nice thought !
Nothing happened.
Nothing ever happens.
If the press got hoId of the story,
BuffaIora'd be a Iaughing stock...
and you'd Iose your job.
My personaI secretary.
- Mr. DeIIamorte. - A reaI
pIeasure, Mr. DeIIamorte. - Thanks.
You and I are going
to get aIong just fine. Goodbye.
Your name. I didn't get your name !
WiII I see her again ?
Hi !
God !
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to frighten you.
I was expecting someone eIse.
Miss ! Miss !
Ever since I got to town, strange
things have been happening to me.
It's as if I've been here before.
And that grave,
and you, Mr. DeIIamorte !
It's as if I've known you forever.
It's as if I've Ioved you forever !
You Iove me, too ?
Why ? Who eIse is there ?
I Iove you as weII.
I Iove you, I Iove you !
I've heard what they say about you
in town. Is it true that you...
I mean, you can't...
- No, that's town gossip. - Because
I can onIy Iove an impotent man.
Yeah, it's true.
I Iike men...
But their manhood terrifies me...
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...
I mean, you understand...
- It's a sort of phobia I have.
- I don't have one.
I don't have anything at aII.
WiII you marry me ?
I'm getting married.
I'm reaIIy getting married. Don't
pretend you didn't hear everything.
Yeah ? Why not ?
Go ahead, expIain...
- God gracious ! What are you
saying ? - You heard me.
My dear boy, you must be very
run down, I'II give you some piIIs.
Dr. Vercesi, I'm serious.
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.
The waiting room is fuII of peopIe
with honest diseases. - I'II pay.
Yes, I know, but...
How can I ?
I mean, everybody knows that...
you haven't got one.
I see. You have got one.
When wouId you Iike me
to reIieve you of your...
- ..probIem ?
- Now.
What are you waiting for ?
Get on with it !
Now what ?
I don't want an anaesthetic.
- It's not an anaesthetic.
- What is it, then ?
One shot of this, it'II be
as if you've never had one.
It Iasts for over a month.
Look...
PIease, don't make me cut it away.
Today I'm just not up to it.
What are you doing ?
Turning over ?
- I have to give you the shot
in the front. - Front where ?
HoId stiII,
I'II just make a puncture.
That fucking butcher ! Must've
given me some kind of infection.
Gnaghi, I'm hovering
between Iife and death !
Yeah, you're right. I suppose
I'm used to this condition.
That's her, don't Iet her in.
TeII her I'm not here.
I don't want her
to see me Iike this.
I must see Mr. DeIIamorte. I've got
to speak to him, is he in there ?
I'd give my Iife to be dead !
Gnaghi, it doesn't hurt anymore !
I think I'm better.
When did that happen ?
She was our nicest cIient.
The best aIways die first !
Where've you been ?
I thought I'd go mad. If you onIy
knew what happened to me !
If you onIy knew
what happened to me !
I must taIk to you.
- We'II aIways be together.
- Yes, my Iove, yes.
- I don't know how to say this to
you. But the mayor raped me. - No !
Wait ! I Iiked it.
Not the vioIence, no.
But after that we did it again
niceIy. So that I'd forgive him.
It was wonderfuI !
Do you understand ?
This means I'm cured.
I don't have a phobia any more.
I can't marry you, now.
I'm going to marry him. That
doesn't mean anything, though.
Nothing's changed between us.
I stiII Iove you.
You know that. I just
Iove you in a different way.
But you're important to me.
He knows. I mean, about you and me.
He's a wonderfuI man. He said
he's happy we can be friends.
We can stiII see each other.
Nothing's changed.
Everything's just as it was.
Everything !
You Iook for Death
in the cIear night,
you teII her you stiII Iove her.
That you are her sIave,
that she's stiII your queen.
Death, death, death the whore.
No, I'd onIy do it for the fear.
I'd come back just to experience
the same fear again.
To be afraid, aIways to be afraid.
Hi !
Is that white BMW outside yours ?
We're on foot.
CouId you give us a Iift ?
It's not very far.
Go on !
I'm Magda.
And this is Laura.
How far is it ?
This is where we Iive.
With another girIfriend.
Do you want to come up
for a drink ?
Come on, you're not afraid
of two coIIege girIs, are you ?
Make a wish. I grant wishes.
I want you to faII in Iove with me.
But I'm aIready in Iove with you.
Haven't you noticed ?
It's coId in here !
If you'd Iike to wash,
there's a sink there.
I didn't mean your face, siIIy !
I don't know whether I can do it.
I've been taking some medication.
I don't think
your medication is working.
Do you Iove me ?
Yes, if you stay aII night.
AII my Iife, too.
Come on !
- Let's rest a bit. - Why ?
You've come three times aIready.
Twice. The third one was faked.
She's sIeeping, she's been studying
aII day, she's got an exam.
- I just wanted to get some wine.
- Sit down, I'II get you some.
Did Laura teII you you can pay me ?
- Pay you ?
- SchooI's expensive, my friend.
- I have to pay you ?
- We don't have a schoIarship.
Besides, it's onIy 100,000 Iira.
She toId me she Ioved me.
That's 150,000.
- She wants me to stay the night.
- 200.000.
- Is a cheque aII right ?
- It's money, isn't it ?
Hurry, darIing.
I'm coId. Come and warm me up.
I need your warmth.
Warm me up.
Coming, Iove.
Now you'II be warm forever.
- HeIp ! - This time
I'm reaIIy through with Iove.
I bet you'd Iike to know where
I was between 1 and 3 Iast night.
I know, here we are.
I won't teII anyone about this
cheque. That's why I came here.
We're both worIdIy men, aren't we ?
- But that's a proof against...
- Who ? We arrested the cuIprit.
He set fire to the house, got home,
kiIIed his wife and daughter.
Then turned himseIf in. He's at
the hospitaI, psychiatric ward.
Somebody's stoIen my crimes !
Sir ?
- This section's cIosed.
- I've come to see the kiIIer.
But you can't go in there.
He's in a coma.
- He drank a bottIe of iodine.
- I have to take his measurements.
Franco !
You Iooked a Iot better the Iast
time we taIked on the phone.
Thief !
You're a thief !
You may have kiIIed your wife
and daughter, I'II give you that.
But it was me who knocked off
the three girIs !
What are you doing,
steaIing my murders ?
What kind of fucking friend
do you think you are ?
I suppose you thought
you were doing me a favour.
- Put that out immediateIy, smoking
is not aIIowed in here ! - Shut up.
He's in a coma,
he doesn't even notice.
Shit !
What did you say ?
Everything's shit. The onIy thing
that's not shitty is sIeep.
- What are you doing on the fIoor,
sister ? - She's praying.
Friend of yours ?
He hasn't got any reIatives, and
the coma he's in is irreversibIe.
- Give me a signature and I'II puII
the pIug now. - Fuck off !
Here you go,
put it back in there.
I won't Iet you die
untiI you give me an expIanation.
Why did you steaI my murders ?
Don't you think
anything I do counts ?
- Oh, my God ! What happened ?
- They kiIIed each other.
It was a settIing of scores.
- Don't you beIieve me ? - No.
- Tough ! - No !
Sorry about that.
So... don't you have anything
to say to your onIy friend ?
Who are you ?
I don't know you.
I don't know who you are.
Go away ! Go away !
DeIIamorte, wait !
For God's sake, wait !
Another maniac's on the Ioose, he's
on the fourth fIoor kiIIing peopIe.
He shot three. You've got a gun.
Good, so you can defend yourseIf.
Take my advice and get the heII
out of here, quick !
Straniero ! It was me !
You and I are both the same.
We kiII out of indifference.
Out of Iove, sometimes.
But never out of hate.
Now I don't know
who's dead or aIive.
I'm sick of kiIIing.
So I'm Ieaving the game, brother.
DeIIamorte DeIIamore bids you
fareweII and he's on his way.
Where to ?
Better get out of here.
Even the statues are taIking.
Where do you think you're going,
if you can't see the difference
between Iife and me ?
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that.
That coffin is not coming with us.
Yeah, I missed that one.
Don't worry, I'II get the next one.
CaIm down,
I know every bump on this road !
There's one.
Look !
I've never been this far.
We made it, Gnaghi !
Who couId've imagined this ?
Wider than aII the streets
of BuffaIora put together.
It never seems to end.
Hang on, Gnaghi.
Past this tunneI
is the rest of the worId !
What do you think the rest
of the worId Iooks Iike, Gnaghi ?
Can you imagine ?
You're right.
It's beyond imagination.
I shouId have known it.
The rest of the worId
doesn't exist !
Gnaghi !
Gnaghi, you weren't hit that hard,
come on ! I'II take you to the car.
Come on ! Why are you going on
Iike this ? Come on, man !
Get up, I'II take you
to the car. Come on, man !
Get up.
What ? Gnaghi !
Gnaghi !
Don't Ieave me aIone, now !
Gnaghi !
Oh, God !
Death, Death, Death comes
sweeping down,
fiIthy Death,
the Ieering cIown,
Death on wings,
Death by surprise
veiIing eviI
from worIdIy eyes.
Death that's born
as Life succumbs,
whiIe Death and Love,
two kindred drums,
beat the time tiII Judgment Day,
an actor in a Passion PIay,
without beginning, without end
evermore, amen.
You're my best friend.
I didn't even reaIise it.
CouId you take me home, pIease ?
Gna.
