Here, you can take this ticket!
You can have this ticket and keep it!
I'm not paying that ticket!
Jesus! Why don't you watch
where you're going!
Then I want you
to go down to the cellar...
...and check the water under
the boiler. I want that done today!
- Could you do that?
- Would you give me a hand?
I ain't the doorman, Ms. Barrett,
I'm the building superintendent.
You're also a human being.
It's not my job, but what the hell,
I'll do you a favor.
When are you gonna fix the radiator
in the baby's room?
- You know, I asked you last week.
- Didn't I do that?
Well, it's getting really
cold in there. I...
Okay, well, it's no problem.
Hey!
Hey, stop that carriage!
- Stop!
- Get it!
That's my baby!
Watch out!
Jesus!
Oscar, watch out!
My God!
Please!
Stop that carriage!
- How many of them are there?
- 14. They're in here.
I hope you can handle it.
It's been like a nightmare.
- How big are they?
- 4 feet.
Hey, kids, listen up! Listen up!
Look who's here!
Hey!
How you doing, kids?
I thought it was gonna be He-Man.
- Yeah.
- Hey, hey, I know.
Why don't we all sit down
and we'll have fun.
Yeah!
You know, my dad says
you guys are full of crap.
- Jason.
- Some people have trouble...
...believing in the paranormal.
- No, he says you're full of crap...
...and that's why you're
out of business.
Song.
Come on, everybody!
There's something strange
In the neighbourhood
Who you gonna call?
- He-Man!
- He-Man! He-Man! He-Man!
And it don't look good
- Let's go get a beer, all right?
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Call anytime.
- Bye.
Look, that's it. I've had it, Ray.
- No more parties.
- Here's your share.
I'm tired of taking abuse
from overprivileged 9-year-olds.
I know, Z, but we can't quit now.
The holidays are coming up.
- It's our best season.
- Ray.
Man, face it.
Ghostbusters doesn't exist.
A year from now, those kids
won't even remember who we are.
Ungrateful little yuppie larvae.
After all we did for this city.
Yeah, we conjured up
a 100-foot marshmallow man...
...blew the top three floors
off an uptown high-rise...
...ended up getting sued
by every state, county...
...and city agency in New York.
Yeah, but what a ride.
- Right out into the middle of traffic
and I started really running after it.
And then it just suddenly stopped,
right in the middle of the street.
And did anyone else see this happen?
Well, sure, hundreds of people.
Egon, I didn't imagine this.
I'm not saying you did. In science,
we look for the simplest explanation.
- We're ready.
- Good.
We'll start with
the negative calibration.
- What are you working on, Egon?
- Trying to determine...
...whether human emotions
affect the physical environment.
It's a theory Ray and I had
when we were still Ghostbusters.
Can they see us?
No. They think they're here
for marriage counseling.
We kept them waiting
for over two hours.
I've been increasing
the temperature in the room.
It's up to 95 degrees at the moment.
Now my assistant has asked them...
...if they'd mind waiting
another half-hour.
Good. Very good.
Very, very nice.
- So, Egon, what do you think?
- Excellent. Just excellent.
Do the happiness index next.
I mean about the carriage.
Well, I'd like to bring Ray in on this,
if you don't mind.
Sure. Whatever you think.
But not Venkman.
Oh, no.
- Do you ever see him?
- Occasionally.
- How is he these days?
- Peter?
Well, he was borderline for a while.
Then he crossed the border.
Does he ever mention me?
No.
Well, we... We didn't part
on very good terms.
And then we sort of lost track
of each other after I got married.
- We're ready for the affection test.
- Send in the puppy.
I thought of getting in touch with him
after my marriage ended, but...
Isn't that sweet?
I appreciate your doing this.
Try not to worry.
Here's my phone number.
You'll call me?
Yes.
I'd rather you didn't mention
any of this to Peter.
No, I won't. I won't.
Thanks.
Let's see what happens
when we take away the puppy.
This... Gee, I don't know...
- father encouraged...
Hi. Welcome back
to World of the Psychic.
I'm Peter Venkman.
I'm chatting with my guest.
Author, lecturer and psychic...
...Milton Angland. Milt, your new book
is called The End of the World.
Now, can you tell us
when it's gonna be...
...or do we have to buy the book?
Well, I predict that the world will end...
...at the stroke of midnight
on New Year's Eve.
This year?
Well, that's cutting it a little bit close,
isn't it? I mean...
Just from a sales point of view,
your book is just coming out...
...you're not gonna see
any paperback sales for a year.
It'll be another year before you know
if you've got mini-series...
...or Movie of the Week possibilities.
Just devil's advocate, Milty.
I mean, shouldn't you have said
"The world's gonna end in 1992"?
- Wait a minute. This is...
- Or better yet, 1994.
This is not just some
money-making scheme, all right?
I have a strong psychic belief...
...that the world will end...
...on New Year's Eve.
- For your sake, I hope you're right.
- Thank you.
Okay, but I think my other guest
may disagree with you.
Elaine.
Now, you had another date in mind.
According to my source...
...the end of the world will be
on February 14th in the year 2016.
Valentine's Day.
Bummer.
Where'd you get your date, Elaine?
I received this information
from an alien.
As I told my husband...
...it was in the Paramus Holiday Inn.
I was having a drink at the bar,
alone...
...and this alien approached me.
He started talking to me.
He bought me a drink.
And then I think he must have used
some kind of a ray...
...or a mind-control device...
...because he forced me
to follow him to his room.
And that's where...
...he told me about the end
of the world.
So your alien had a room
at the Holiday Inn, Paramus?
It might've been a room
on the spacecraft...
...made up to look like
a room at the Holiday Inn.
I can't be sure about that, Peter.
Of course not. And that is
the whole problem with aliens...
...is you just can't trust them.
Occasionally you meet a nice one:
Starman, E.T.
But usually they turn out to be
some kind of big lizard!
That's all the time we've got
for this week on the show.
Next week, though...
Give me Ira. Hairless pets.
Weird. Until then...
...this is Peter Venkman, saying:
See you then. Bye.
Where do you find these people?
What about the telekinetic guy
who bends spoons?
He canceled. This is the best
we could do at short notice.
No respected psychic
will do the show.
- They think you're a fraud.
- I am a fraud.
Mr. Mayor. Lenny. Lenny!
- Pete Venkman.
- Can I help you?
Yeah, get your hand off me.
I'm an old friend.
I wanna say hello, give him a kiss.
I'm Jack Hardemeyer, I'm the mayor's
assistant. I know who you are.
I just don't see any ghosts anywhere.
That's why I wanted to talk
to His Highness.
We did a little job for the city
and got stiffed on the bill...
...by some bureaucratic bookworm
like yourself.
You stay away from the mayor.
He's running for governor next fall.
And we don't need him associated
with two-bit frauds...
...and publicity hounds
like you and your friends.
You know, I'm a voter.
Aren't you supposed to lie to me
and kiss my butt?
All right, yes. Now, I want you
to put the Vigo in the arch.
Under the arch there.
Everything you're doing is bad.
I want you to know this.
You be careful there, all right?
No one listens to me.
Well, Dana, how are you doing?
- How's this Bonington coming?
- It's coming along fine.
This mixture you gave me
is working really well.
Yes? Well, I make
pretty good cocktails, don't I?
Yes, you're doing really...
...quite good work there.
- Thank you.
It won't be long
before you can assist me in...
...more important restoration.
Just a... A white thing.
Well, thank you, Dr. Poha.
- Janosz.
- Janosz.
I've enjoyed working here...
...but now that my baby's older,
I'm gonna try to go back to orchestra.
I'm sorry to hear that you will not...
Be not here.
Well, could I say goodbye?
You know, maybe bring you
to a brunch today?
Well, I can't today, I have
an appointment. In fact, I'd better go.
I don't understand this. Every day
I say, "Can you do something?"
You say, "No, I can't do something."
- Do I have bad breath or something?
- Of course not.
All right.
Well, I'll give you a rain check.
I think that she likes me.
No, I do. I truly do.
This one's interesting, Ray.
Berlin, 1939.
A flower cart took off by itself,
rolled half a kilometer.
- Three hundred eyewitnesses.
- My best to the coven.
Berlin? You know...
...you should also check Duke
University studies on psychokinesis.
- I pulled it.
- Perhaps you could you help me...
...I'm looking for
a love-potion aerosol...
...that I could spray
on a certain Penthouse Pet...
...to obtain her total submission.
- Hello, Venkman.
- Hi, Pete. How's it going?
Very well.
Hi, Egon. How's school?
I bet those science chicks dig
that large cranium of yours, huh?
I think they're more interested
in my epididymis.
Ray, let's close this place up
so you can buy me a calzone.
I can't do that now.
I'm working on something.
But your book came in.
- Magical Paths to Fortune and Power.
- Thank you.
Good luck with that, Venkman.
- Put this on my account?
- Sure.
- Ray, take a look at this.
- Yeah.
What are you guys working on?
Well, we're just kind of...
...checking something out
for a friend.
Neat. Who?
Ray's Occult.
Seven o'clock on weekdays,
midnight on Saturdays.
Thank you.
- Who?
- Who?
Just someone we know.
Who?
- I can't! No! No! No!
- Yes, you can. Who?
- Nobody! Nobody!
- Can you tell me now?
- I can't!
- Now?
Dana Barrett!
My Dana Barrett?
I'll get it.
- Hi, Dana.
- Hi, Ray.
How good to see you.
Thanks for coming.
No problem.
Always glad to help. And hug.
- Hello, Dana.
- Hi, Egon.
Nice place.
I know I'm asking for the big hurt...
...but I thought I'd give us
one more chance.
He tortured me. He pulled my ears.
Hello, Peter.
Hello, Dana.
- What would you like to do first?
- We'd like to examine the baby.
Yeah, and anything associated
with the baby, especially stuffed toys.
- Then the buggy.
- All right. Can I put him here?
- And wherever he sleeps.
- Yes.
- This'll be fine.
- This okay?
- That's fine.
- Okay.
We'll have to lay him down flat.
Okay, sweetheart,
they're gonna take a look at you.
We'll do a cursory
medical examination.
Gammel and Pross Infant Acuity Test?
Sounds good.
We'll finish with an Apgar score.
It's nothing that will
hurt him, right?
No. No, I don't think so.
He'll be fine.
- You ever done this before?
- On a chimp.
So whatever happened
to Mr. Right?
I heard he ditched you
and ran off to Europe.
He didn't ditch me.
We had some problems...
...and he took a very good job offer
from an orchestra in London.
So he ditched you.
Okay. Subject is a male Caucasian...
...approximately...
- 24 inches.
Twenty-four inches in length.
Subject weighs approximately
18 pounds and is about 8 months old.
Okay. Ocular?
Pupillary response normal.
Auditory.
- Appears normal.
- Apillary reflex.
- Appears to be ticklish.
- Yep. Baby ticklish.
You know, you'd have been
better off marrying me.
You never asked me.
And whenever I brought it up,
you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
You never got it, Dana.
I'm a man. I'm sensitive.
I need to feel loved.
I need to be desired.
It's when you started introducing
me as "the old ball and chain."
That's when I left.
Well, I may have
a lot of personal problems...
...but I'm a total professional
when it comes to my job.
- Hey, Egon.
- What?
- What are we doing?
- He seems to be fine, Dana.
- He's very healthy.
- He's okay.
When he does sleep,
where do you put him?
Right around here. I'll show you.
Venkman, would you get
a stool specimen, please?
Business or personal?
It's a little messy.
Well, we don't wanna play,
just sweep for valences.
Very cheerful.
My parents didn't believe in toys.
You wanna play with a big kid?
You know, I should have been
your father.
I mean, I could have been.
I understand.
Help! He's gone
completely berserk. Help!
You mean you never
even had a Slinky?
We had part of a Slinky.
But I straightened it.
Help! Help!
He...
He had some sort of clear liquid
coming out of his mouth.
Well, that happens.
Well, what do you think?
Well, he's ugly.
I mean, he's not
Elephant Man ugly...
...but he's not attractive.
Was his father ugly?
- Don't listen.
- And he stinks.
You're ripe, señor.
Did his father stink?
Yeah. Daddy was a smelly, huh?
- What's your name?
- His name is Oscar.
Named after a hot dog.
You poor man.
You poor, poor man.
But seriously, there's nothing...
...unusual about him, is there?
Well, I don't have
a lot of experience with babies.
But you're excited now...
...because Mama's here to get
your stool sample. Right, Mama?
- Stool sample?
- Yeah.
- Nothing.
- So, what, brainiac?
I'd like to run gynaecological tests
on the mother.
- Who wouldn't?
- Let's check the street.
It stopped right over there...
...in the middle of the crosswalk.
- I can get us there.
- Venkman.
- Hold on.
We're scientists, excuse us.
Get out of the way!
Thanks a lot.
We gotta do an inquiry here.
Hold on. Thanks. Appreciate it.
- Thanks.
- You gonna move out of there or what?
Relax, you're on the meter. Hey!
We're scientists, get out of the way.
I think we hit the honeypot.
There's something brewing under
the street. I've got 1118 on the PKE.
Two-point-five GEVs
on the gigameter.
Well, what does that mean?
Hey! How you doing?
- Me?
- Yeah.
- Fine. Fine. It's cutting fine now.
- Great.
Why are you cutting?
Why am I cutting?
- Yeah.
- Boss!
Who told you to stop cutting?
- Somebody...?
- What're you guys doing?
- Did you tell him to stop?
- Yes. What are you doing?
What's it look like? Why don't you
let us work? We let you work.
Hey, take it easy.
I tell you why we're here.
Because jerk downtown is making
us work on a Friday night.
- Am I right, Peter?
- Of course you are.
- Is he right, Ziggy?
- Yo.
- You guys take it easy, all right?
- Come on. Come on.
What have you been doing?
While you were getting coffee
for an hour...
...I've been digging a big hole
in the street.
Looks like you uncovered
an old air shaft.
Man, that just goes on and on.
This is very intense.
We should get a deeper reading.
Yeah. We're gonna need
a deeper reading.
Yeah, somebody
has to go down there.
Yeah, somebody's gotta
go down there.
Stinging! I'm stinging!
Listen to me.
What? Who?
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia...
...the sorrow of Moldavia,
command you.
Command me, lord.
On a mountain of skulls
in the castle of pain...
...I sat on a throne of blood.
What was, will be.
What is, will be no more.
Now is the season of evil.
Evil?
Find me a child,
that I might live again.
Yes. A child.
A child. A child?
A child.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm good.
The speed's good, boys.
Keep it coming.
We're breaking through.
I see some light.
I'm in some kind of a chamber.
There's tile work.
- Slime!
- What?
It's a river of slime!
There's gotta be 25,000 gallons of it.
It's flowing through here like a river.
Van Horne. Pneumatic transit.
I can't believe it.
The old pneumatic transit system,
it's still here.
Okay. That's good.
Hold me up. That's good.
What do you see?
All right.
Let's see if I can get a sample.
What's going on here?
Hey, what's the story?
Hey, what, you boneheads are
gonna roust me out again?
I got 3000 phones out
in Greenwich Village.
I got about 8 million miles
of cable I gotta check.
You gonna come shake
my monkey tree again?!
What are you talking about?
The phone lines are over there.
What did I say to you?
The phone lines are over there.
- What did I say? How many times?
- Hey!
Hey, you're not with Con Ed
or the phone company. We checked.
So tell me another one.
I got a major gas leak here!
Where do you think all this
is coming from, the sky?
Okay, boys.
Boys?
Pull me up now, all right?
There's some kind of activity
going on with this stuff.
Boys? Hey, help!
- Take me up!
- Ray!
Start it! Start it!
Boys?
Hey, what's going on up there?
Come on! Get me out of this hole!
Sweetie.
Hello.
Go back to sleep, darling.
- Who is it?
- It's Janosz.
Janosz.
Hello, Janosz.
- This is a surprise.
- Oh, hello.
Yes. Well, I happened to be here
in this neighborhood...
...and I thought that I would stop by
to see how is it with you.
Yeah, because of all this blackness,
it was.
- We're fine. Thank you. Thank...
- Well, then, you're okay?
- How's the baby?
- He's okay. Yes.
- He's sleeping.
- Oh, but I "woo"-ed.
- That's okay.
- All right, and...
...do you need anything?
You know?
Do you want me to come in?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
Just thought that I would check.
You know.
Well, hey, you.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Good night, Janosz.
Before we begin this trial,
I want to make one thing very clear.
The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts...
...and I don't believe in them either.
I don't want to hear a lot of malarkey
about goblins, spooks and demons.
We'll stick to the facts in this case...
...and leave the ghost stories
to the kiddies, understood?
Sounds like a pretty
open-minded guy.
They call him "The Hammer."
What can we do?
It's in the hands of our lawyer now.
I think you guys
are making a big mistake.
I do mostly tax law and some
probate stuff occasionally.
I got my law degree at night school.
Well, that's fine, Louis.
We got arrested at night.
Look, just put these guys away fast...
...and make sure they go away
for a long, long time, okay?
I don't think it'll be hard,
with this list of charges.
Good. Very good.
Violating a judicial
restraining order...
...willul destruction of public property,
fraud, malicious mischief.
See you in a couple of years,
at your first parole hearing.
You'll never take us alive.
All right, all right.
Let's get on with it.
Your Honor...
...ladies and gentlemen
of the audience...
...I don't think it's fair
to call my clients frauds.
Okay, so the blackout was a big
problem for everybody, okay?
I was in an elevator for two hours
and I had to make the whole time.
But I don't blame them.
Because one time I turned into a dog
and they helped me. Thank you.
Very good, Louis.
Short but pointless.
Mr. Fianella...
...please look at exhibits A through F
on the table over here.
Do you recognize this equipment?
Yeah, that's the stuff
the cops took from their truck.
Do you know what
this equipment is used for?
I don't know. Catching ghosts, maybe?
I don't know.
May I remind the court the defendants
are under a judicial restraining order...
...that strictly forbids them
from performing services...
...as paranormal investigators
or eliminators.
So noted.
Now, Mr. Fianella...
...can you identify the substance
in this jar marked "Exhibit F"?
Yeah. Yeah, that's the stuff, all right.
Your Honor, I've been working
underground for Con Ed for 27 years.
I never saw anything like this
in my life.
Whatever's down there,
they must've put it there.
- No, we didn't!
- Ray, Ray.
Shut up!
- So you were just trying to help...
- Help out a friend.
- Who was frightened.
- Who was scared.
And when you're scared...
What?
- There was no evil...
- No evil was intended. No malice.
When you live in a place
and you love it...
...you don't want nothing bad
to happen.
- What?
- It was a one-shot...
It'll never happen again. It's an
isolated incident, a one-shot deal.
- Objection, Your Honor.
- What?
- He's leading the witness.
- Sustained.
Give me a break.
We're both lawyers.
Mr. Tully, do you have any
questions for this witness...
...that might have some bearing
on this case?
- Do I?
- No, we've helped them out enough.
No, Your Honor.
Your witness.
Dr. Venkman...
...would you please tell the court why it
is that you and your co-defendants...
...took it upon yourselves to dig a very
big hole in the middle of First Avenue.
Well, there's so many holes
in First Avenue...
...we really didn't think
anyone would notice.
Keep that up, mister,
I'll find you in contempt.
I'm truly sorry, Your Honor.
I'll ask you again.
Why were you digging the hole?
And please remember
you're under oath.
There are some things
in this world...
...that go way beyond
human understanding.
Things that cannot be explained...
...things that most people
don't wanna know about.
That is where we come in.
So you're saying that the world
of the supernatural...
...is your exclusive province?
Kitten, I think
what I'm saying is that...
...sometimes shit happens,
someone has to deal with it...
...and who you gonna call?
Shut up!
Peter Venkman, Raymond Stantz,
Egon Spengler, stand up!
Get up!
You too, Mr. Tully.
I find you guilty on all charges.
I order you to pay fines
in the amount of $25,000 each.
I sentence you to 18 months at the
correctional facility at Riker's Island.
Egie, she's twitching.
I'm not finished!
On a more personal note,
let me just go on record...
...as saying that there's no place
for fakes, charlatans...
- Your Honor...
- Shut up!
- Tricksters like you in decent society.
- Sir, this is important.
You play on innocent people's
gullibility.
- Yes, sir.
- Be quiet!
- But...
- If my hands weren't tied...
...by the unalterable fetters
of the law...
...then I would invoke the tradition
of our illustrious forebears...
...reach back to a purer,
sterner justice...
...and have you burned at the stake!
Oh, my God, the Scoleri brothers.
- The Scoleri brothers!
- Friends of yours?
I tried them for murder!
Gave them the chair!
You gotta do something!
Why don't you just tell them
you don't believe in ghosts.
You gotta do something.
Help me!
Don't talk to me.
Talk to my attorney.
That's me! My guys are still under
a misstrangement order.
That blue thing I got from her.
They could be exposing themselves.
And you don't want us
exposing ourselves.
- You're next, Bubbles.
- All right! I rescind the order!
- Case dismissed!
- Hurray! We won the case!
Now, do something!
I always hated this part
of the business.
You know, it's been a couple years
since we used this stuff.
- I hope it still works.
- It should.
Power cells have
a half-life of 5000 years.
There's no time for a bench test.
Heat them up.
- Do...
- Re...
Egon!
You got him, Venkman!
Hold him! Steady.
Come on, big boy. I'm gonna take
you home to my private zoo.
You got him. You got him!
- Egie, bring the trap.
- Okay, okay.
Behind you, Ray!
Hold him, Ray!
Venkman, start bringing him back!
Come on, you big meanie.
Let's go, chubby.
Ray, keep pulling him to the right.
Okay, the trap's going in.
No, no, Spengie!
- Hold it, Ray!
- Hit it!
- Two in the box!
- Ready to go!
- We be fast.
- And they be slow!
We're the best! We're the beautiful!
We're the only...
...Ghostbusters.
- We're back!
Ghostbusters.
Yes, we're back.
Certified check,
cash or money order.
Get him!
Bye-bye.
- What is it, honey?
- It's that darn ghost again.
He just won't leave us alone.
I guess we're just going
to have to move.
No, wait!
Don't worry, we're not moving.
He is.
Who are you going to call?
Ghostbusters.
Now.
Janine, lunch!
Boy, it smells like somebody
took a big...
With our special half-price
service plan.
What? Hold on. Half-price?
- Have we all gone mad?
- I guess so, Pete.
Because that's not all.
Tell them, Egon.
You mean the Ghostbusters
hot-beverage thermal mug...
...and free balloons for the kids?
We've been experimenting with
the plasm from the subway tunnel.
Careful.
- Should I get spoons?
- Don't bother. Watch this.
Try it, Ray.
You! You worthless piece of slime!
You ignorant, disgusting blob.
You're nothing but an unstable
short-chain molecule!
You foul, obnoxious muck!
You have a weak
electrochemical bond!
I have seen some disgusting crud
in my time...
...but you take the cake.
- You're a... You're just...
- Hey.
This is what you do
with your spare time?
This is an incredible breakthrough.
What a discovery.
A psycho-reactive substance.
Whatever this stuff is, it responds
to human emotional states.
Mood slime.
Oh, baby.
You mean this stuff actually
feeds on bad vibes.
Like a cop in a doughnut factory.
We've been running tests to get
an equally strong positive reaction.
What kind of tests?
Well, we sing to it
and we talk to it...
...and say supportive,
nurturing things to it.
You're not sleeping with it,
are you, Ray?
Oh, you.
- It's always the quiet ones.
- You hound.
- How about the kinetic tests?
- Okay.
Ordinary household toaster.
We'll take your word for that.
It responds to music. We've been
experimenting with easy listening.
Middle-of-the-road stuff. Paul Young,
"Dust in the Wind." That works.
- Works for me.
- Loves Jackie Wilson.
You guys do this at night
when I'm not here?
I get it. It sings. It sounds
exactly like Jackie.
- That's fantastic.
- Just watch.
Does it do Emmylou Harris?
Oh, it dances too.
Shake it up!
Oh, baby, you're my number one
Christmas boutique gift item.
First time somebody gets mad,
that toaster could eat their hand.
No, no, no. We put a warning label
on it. We don't have any liability.
Oh, did you ever go for it!
The old man-eating toaster bit.
- Get him!
- No!
Hello. I'm looking for Dana Barrett.
- Room 304, restoration.
- Thank you.
Hey, Dr. Venkman!
World of the Psychic.
- That's right. How are you?
- I'm a big, big fan of yours.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
It was one of my two favorite shows.
You're kidding me. Well, great.
What was the other one?
- Bass Masters. It's a fishing show.
- Yeah, I know Bass Masters. Sure.
You're good, pretty eyes.
I didn't paint it.
I'm just cleaning it.
- It's a Gauguin.
- Oh, I've heard of him.
Hey, Dana. Aren't you going
to introduce me to your friend?
Sure. Peter Venkman,
this is Dr. Janosz Poha...
...the head of our department.
Yes, I have, of course, have
seen you on the television.
Quite enjoy. You're not here
on business, I hope?
Well, it's top-secret. Say, Johnny,
you got a Gauguin too.
No. Actually, I'm preparing this portrait
for the new Romantic exhibition.
Yes. This is Prince Vigo,
the ruler of Carpathia and Moldavia.
Bit of a sissy, isn't he?
He was a very powerful magician,
Dr. Venkman.
And a genius in many ways.
He was also a lunatic
and a genocidal madman.
I hate this painting.
I've felt uncomfortable...
...ever since it came up
from storage.
Well, you're probably feeling
what Vigo is feeling:
Carpathian kitten loss.
He's missed his kitten.
We'll just put one in here
by the castle.
We don't go around altering
valuable artwork.
Yes, I think, go.
Yes, the joyfulness is over.
He's kidding.
Well, you're not gonna get a green
card with that attitude, pal. Okay?
I don't know what to...
Oh, of course. Of course.
I get it. You're sweet on
this hunky stud.
You know, Peter, every now
and then I get the feeling...
...that painting is watching me,
even smiling at me.
You know, I think we got
more food on your shirt...
...than we did in your mouth.
Okay.
Bath. You get to take a bath,
don't you?
You know what you get to do?
Do you know what's more fun
than anything?
Splash Mommy.
"I get to splash Mommy." Yes.
We'll be ready in just a moment.
Mommy's gonna take her shirt off too.
No! No!
Peter, it's me. Please let us in.
What the hell is this?
Peter, let us in, please.
I didn't know where else to go.
The most awful thing happened.
The bathtub...
The bathtub was trying to eat Oscar.
I was giving him a bath. There was
all this pink ooze everywhere...
...and it was reaching for him.
- Okay, you're all right.
I'm not gonna let them get you.
- All right. You're all safe now, okay?
- I was so terrified.
- Yes, darling. I'm so sorry.
- You guys just sit down. Relax.
Come on. Just sit down. I'll get you
guys a shirt or something. Hold on.
Ray. Yeah, Dana's just come
over to my place.
Well, actually, her tub tried to eat her.
What? Are you serious?
Well, that's great!
I mean, that's terrible.
But it's great for what we...
Yeah, I will.
Yeah, sure, we'll get right on it.
Spengler. A major slime-related
psychokinetic event.
- What happened?
- Something came out of Dana's tub.
- Tried to grab her and the baby.
- They all right?
- She got out and went to Venkman's.
- This is interesting.
Remember the painting
Venkman mentioned?
I ran "Vigo the Carpathian"
through the occult reference net.
Look what came up.
Nice ugly history.
You think there's a connection
between this Vigo character and the...
...slime?
Is the atomic weight of cobalt 58.9?
Better get to Dana's apartment.
I wanna check out that bathtub.
It'd be a good idea to go
to the museum in the morning...
...get a look at that painting.
Ray's going to your place
to take a look.
- He is?
- Okay.
I have been holding on to this
for a long time, Oscar.
I got this from a girl who got this
from Joe Willie Namath, okay?
We don't know how.
We don't wanna know.
So I would appreciate it if you
would not hose this thing down...
...give it your own personal rinse.
Thank you.
An excellent time
to start practicing...
...a thing we big guys
like to call self-control.
Get out of here. Oh, look at him.
Look at him. Oh, look at his gut.
Oh, he's a coconut, this guy.
You're gonna be staying at Uncle
Pete's until this thing blows over.
This is your place now.
Hi.
Come on in. This is my place.
So how are we gonna handle
the sleeping arrangements?
Well, what's best for me is...
...if I lie on my side like this
and you spoon up beside me...
...your arm draped over me.
We do it the other way...
...I get your hair caught in my throat
and I choke in the night.
Well, how about you on the sofa
and me and the baby in the bed?
It's a way to go.
It's so late. I really ought
to put him down.
- May I?
- Yeah, if you want to.
You're short.
Your belly button sticks out too far.
And you're a terrible burden
on your poor mother.
- Find anything at Dana's?
- Nothing but mood slime residue...
...around the bathtub. But I got
something on that Vigo character.
Found it in Magicians, Martyrs
and Madmen.
- Dig that.
- Vigo the Carpathian...
...born 1505, died 1610.
105 years old.
He hung in there.
He didn't die of old age, either.
He was poisoned, stabbed, shot...
...hung, stretched, disembowelled,
drawn and quartered.
- I guess he wasn't too popular.
- Not exactly a man of the people.
Also Vigo the Cruel,
Vigo the Torturer...
...Vigo the Despised
and Vigo the Unholy.
Wasn't he also Vigo the Butch?
And dig this.
There was a prophecy.
Just before his head died,
his last words were:
"Death is but a door. Time is
but a window. I'll be back."
Let's suck in the guts, guys.
We're the Ghostbusters.
- Go! Go. Please, go. You. Yes, you.
- Who's this wiggler?
- He's yours, Ray. Sic him.
- I have...
Hi. Ray Stantz from the Ghostbusters.
Nice to see you.
Beautiful lab. We're just doing
a routine spook check.
- Dr. Venkman, Dana is not here.
- Yeah, we know that, Johnny.
- So why are you came?
- We got a report...
...there was a major creep in the area.
We checked and you were on the list.
Where in the hell
are you from, anyway?
The Upper West Side.
The whole room's
extremely hot, Peter.
- That's one ugly dude.
- Hot?
Oh, that's Vigo. Mr. Vigo? Vigs,
would you look this way, please?
No, don't. No! No!
No photographs, please.
Slides are available in the gift shop.
Yeah, thanks. Thank you, Winston.
All right. You know what?
Give me angry, will you?
Give me angry. You've had
a bad day. You're cranky.
Good. Angrier.
I'm scared. You're scaring me.
Stop it. Yeah. Good!
Okay, walk for me, talk for me.
Yeah, yeah!
Okay, give me hot and sexy.
Can you do it? You can. Oh, boy.
Show me some teeth. Come on.
I bet the girls like you, huh?
Do the girls?
Do the guys?
Bet they both do, huh?
What about the animals?
They like you? That's it, more!
You're big, you're big. All right,
destroy me. Destroy me!
Yeah! Destroy me.
Yeah, yeah! Give it, give it!
Venkman, we need to talk.
Come on.
I've worked with better.
But not many. Thank you.
John, thanks.
- Hey, you finished?
- Yeah, I'm finished here.
- Are you all right?
- What?
- You coming down with something?
- Me?
Dana. Your prince.
Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.
She cleaned.
- Hi.
- Hi.
He's asleep. Come here.
- What happened with my apartment?
- Well...
...the guys spent
the whole night there.
They went through
all your personal stuff...
...tried on some of your clothes,
made some long-distance calls...
...cleaned out the fridge.
- Did they find anything?
They found a little bit
of that pink slime.
Oh, God. Well, what am
I supposed to do now?
You are supposed to get dressed
and get crazy with me...
...on the streets of Manhattan.
- I don't think...
This is exactly what you need.
I have got you a babysitter.
- The whole thing's wired.
- I don't think we should go on a date.
You know, and I can't leave Oscar
in a strange place...
...with a strange person.
Strange person?
Janine Melnitz, from my staff.
Janine has experience babysitting?
Here.
Thank you.
I've also brought some things
from your apartment.
Some wardrobe choices. A couple
of provocative ensembles in here.
- I'll leave it up to you.
- Okay, but after dinner.
Don't put any of those old, cheap
moves on me, okay?
- No, no, no.
- It's different.
I have all new cheap moves.
Hey, you. Hey, you.
It looks like you're awake, huh?
You're awake.
Yes, Osco.
You're gonna have the place
to yourself tonight.
It's gonna be pretty neat.
I got some Laura Antonelli
tapes if you wanna watch them.
Dana, did you see
some shirts here...
...in the floor-bed area?
- Yeah, I put them in the hamper.
- I have a hamper?
- Yeah, it's in the bathroom.
Neat.
Will you tell me the next time
you do that?
Well, I thought they were dirty.
I have more than two grades
of laundry, okay?
There's not just clean and dirty.
There are many subtle levels, okay?
You hang this outside
the window for 20 minutes...
...it's perfectly fine.
Interesting role model for you,
Oscar, huh?
Well, they couldn't get to you
until after the New Year.
Well, just don't go in there.
Louis, I'm closing up!
Well, should I take the subway
or the surface roads?
- Or what? It's kind of busy...
- Well, I'm walking. Good night.
Well, now.
Well, well, hang on, now.
Do you maybe wanna...?
No, no.
Do you wanna have
something to eat with me?
Well, yeah, I'd love that.
But I told Dr. Venkman
I'd babysit for him.
- Oh, well...
- Do you wanna babysit with me?
- Okay. I would.
- Great. His place at 8.
- Bye.
- His place at 8. All right.
- I can get his address from the W2...
- Hey, buddy. Move it!
We were right, Ray.
Multi-planar Kirlian emanations.
Yeah, well, here's your
next month's cover of GQ.
Check out the aura on this sucker.
Now, there's definitely
a living presence there.
We should get a deeper look.
I'll run this shot through
the spectral analyzer.
Good, I'll try turning up the roentgens.
So, what do you think?
Chinese?
- How about Thai?
- No, it's too spicy.
- Greek?
- Mexican?
- Pizza.
- Thin or thick?
Chicago.
What the hell is that?
I know what it is.
- I've seen it before.
- Where?
When you guys dangled me
like a worm on a hook...
...a hundred feet below First Avenue.
That's the river of slime.
Ray.
We need a blanket or a hose
or something.
Get out.
Why is this closed?
Winston! Winston!
- Fire!
- Back away, back away.
What are we gonna do,
put our heads in the toilet?
Taxi!
Pete, it's great that you're here.
We've got incredible news.
Wait a minute.
Can I have one try?
All-you-can-eat barbecue rib
night at the Sizzler?
No. We analyzed the photos of Vigo.
The spectrogram shows...
...a river of slime.
- Like the one I saw underground.
We're going into the subway and
sewers to trace the source.
Come on. Change clothes.
We'll wait.
Egon thinks there might be
a tremendous breeding surge...
...in the cockroach population.
- Hi, boys. What's up?
Hi.
Hi.
Dana, the guys are going down into
the sewer to check for slime stuff.
And Egon thinks there may even be
a huge surge in cockroach breeding.
Wanna blow off this dinner thing
and go with them?
Taxi!
Women, huh?
Will you watch your step?
I hate this.
According to this old transit map, there
should be an entrance along here.
I'm not getting anything yet.
Well, at least it's too dark
to see the cockroaches.
Forget cockroaches. It's the subway
rats you gotta worry about.
Big as beavers.
Yeah, some of them go 4 or 5 kilos.
Hey, hey. Enough, all right?
Listen. You can hear them
behind the walls...
...scratching. There must be
thousands of them.
- Just shut up about the rats.
- Okay, okay.
Hello!
Hey!
Hello!
Winston.
Okay, I'm out of here.
They're gone.
What the...?
Before we go any further,
we should get our proton packs.
Good idea.
- What's that?
- What's what?
Sounds like a train.
These lines have been
abandoned for 50 years.
Probably in one of the tunnels
above us.
I don't know.
It sounds awfully close to me.
That was the old New York Central,
City of Albany.
Derailed in 1920,
killed hundreds of people.
Did you catch the number
on the locomotive?
Sorry. I missed it.
Something's trying to stop us.
We must be close.
Where's Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray!
- Ray?
- Ray?
- Ray.
Guys!
- Oh, sorry. I found it.
- What?
- Right here. There's a hole.
- Let's go.
Hey, fellas, what about the packs?
What about the packs?
Unbelievable.
Did I tell you?
I wasn't lying, was I?
You know how much negative energy
it took to generate a flow this size?
New York, what a town.
All right.
Let's see how deep it is.
- Get a sounding.
- Yeah.
All right. 6 feet.
- Twelve feet.
- 12?
- Something's pulling it.
- Hold on!
- Well, I'm trying.
- Ray, help him.
- Give me a hand. Give me a hand!
- Ray, help.
- It's got ahold of him.
- Get his belt off!
- I can't hold it!
- Wait, wait, hold...
A toast to the most charming...
...kindest...
- Oh, it's me.
It's you.
And most unusual man...
...I've ever broken up with.
Speaking of breaking up
with neat guys...
...why did you dump me?
- I didn't dump you. I was...
...protecting myself.
I mean, you weren't very
good for me, you know.
You know that, don't you?
Heck, I'm not even good for me.
You're much better than you realize.
You don't give yourself enough credit.
I need to hear that kind of stuff.
If I had this kind of support...
...on a 24-hour-a-day basis,
I could whip myself into shape...
...by the end of this century.
Well, why don't you just give me
a jingle in the year 2000.
Why don't I give you
a jingle right now?
Seven little dwarves had a limited
partnership in a mining operation.
One day a beautiful princess
came to live with them.
They bartered housekeeping
services for room and board.
Which was a real good deal, because
they didn't have to withhold any taxes.
Which you're not supposed to do,
but for the purposes of this story...
It really is a great place.
I mean, it needs a woman's touch...
...but I think it looks really good.
You know...
Bedtime.
You're very good with children.
Thanks. I practiced on my hamster.
So you live alone?
I used to have a roommate,
but my mom moved to Florida.
Why don't you come over
and sit with me.
Okay.
So you wanna play Boggle
or Super Mario Brothers?
You know...
...I think motherhood's
a very natural instinct.
I'd like a child myself.
Would you?
Tonight?
Nice going, Ray.
What are you trying to do,
drown me?
Yeah, Zeddemore, like it was my fault.
You were too stupid not to drop
that plumb line!
Watch your mouth
or I'll punch you out.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!
- Well, anytime!
- Come on!
It's go time, man.
I want you bad!
Come on!
Wait! Wait!
Stop, stop. Get your
clothes off, quick. Strip.
Oh, dear. Ray, what were we doing?
I was ready to kill you.
It's this stuff. It's like pure,
concentrated evil.
And it's all flowing right to this spot.
- You sure this is it?
- Yeah, he said Armand's.
- Excuse me...
- It's all right. We'll look in the back.
Venkman!
Hey, Venkman!
Please leave. You cannot...
Get out of my restaurant!
It was absolutely incredible!
The greatest tangible evidence...
...of psychic energy in 100 years.
- You're disturbing our guests!
- This is an emergency. One second.
Boys, you're scaring the straights.
Any way we can do this tomorrow?
No, this won't wait until tomorrow.
It's hot and it's ready to pop.
- It's all over the city.
- Under it, actually.
- Rivers of this stuff.
- It's flowing right to the museum.
Yeah, the museum!
Look what he got all over me!
What is this stuff?
- Sorry.
- Oh, God. You mean my museum?
I was gonna tell you between
the dessert and the cheese course.
- There they are!
- You can never go back there.
- You're gonna have to find a new job.
- Psychomagnotheric plasma.
- It affects behavior. We were fighting.
- We were in a fight.
He had him by the throat...
I'm glad they're here.
We gotta see the mayor.
- Oh, Ghostbusters!
- How you doing?
Hey, guys,
come right this way.
You guys got another proton pack?
My kid brother really wants one.
- The proton pack is not a toy.
- I guess he's right.
Dana, we were just babysitting,
honest.
And we watched some TV
and one thing led to another.
- I know what you were doing.
- I didn't know anything would happen.
Hi, Dana.
How was your date?
- It wasn't a date, it was just dinner.
- Well, where's Peter?
He was arrested.
Typical.
- Did he call?
- No, no. Nobody called.
Well, how's Oscar?
Is he all right?
Oh, he's fine. Such a good baby.
He was a little fussy at first...
...then we just gave him some
French bread pizza...
...passed right out.
Good. Good. Well, I'll just
give him a look-see.
- So you think we should go?
- Gee, I don't know.
I don't think we should
leave her alone.
You're right. Let's stay.
- Lenny! Big man!
- Ghostbusters.
Mr. Mayor.
What is this? A slumber party?
That's what we're here to talk about.
Look, I don't wanna hear
anything about it.
You've got two minutes.
Make it good.
Well, first of all, Mr. Mayor,
it's a great pleasure to see you again.
We'd like to say almost 50 percent
of us voted for you in the last election.
- I appreciate that.
- I'm sorry we always meet...
...under these circumstances.
Mr. Mayor, we're here tonight because
a psychomagnotheric slime flow...
...of immense proportions
is building up beneath the city.
- Psycho-what?
- Psychomagnotheric.
- Big word.
- Negative emotions...
...are materializing in the form
of a psychoreactive plasm...
...with explosive supernormal
potential.
Does anybody speak English here?
Yeah, Your Honor, what we're
trying to tell you is, like...
...all the bad feelings,
the hate, anger, violence...
...of the city is turning into this sludge.
I didn't believe it at first,
but we just swam in it...
...and we almost killed each other.
This is insane! Do we really
have to listen to this?
Can't you stop your lips from
flapping for two little minutes?
Lenny, have you been out
on the street lately?
Do you know how weird it is out there?
We've taken a head count.
There seem to be 3 million
completely miserable assholes...
...living in the Tri-State area.
- Oh, please.
I beg your pardon. 3 million and one.
What budgie-brain doesn't realize
is that if we don't do something fast...
...this place will blow
like a frog on a hot plate.
- Yeah, right.
- What am I supposed to do?
Go on television
and tell 10 million people...
...they have to be nice
to each other?
Being miserable and treating
other people like dirt...
...is every New Yorker's
God-given right.
Your two minutes are up.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Wait.
- You're making a mistake, Mr. Mayor.
A very newsworthy mistake.
The Times is gonna be interested...
...and, you know, The Post...
- Now, now...
"Mayor Drowns in River of Slime."
- "Times Square Slime."
- "Slime Square."
Fine. Now, before you go running
off to the newspapers with this...
...would you consider telling this slime
business to some people downtown?
It's gotta be done right away.
Well, it's gonna come back!
This city's in danger!
The whole state! The world!
- All we wanna do is help!
- I'm warning you.
The mayor wants them kept under
strict observation for a few days.
We think they're seriously disturbed
and potentially dangerous.
- Well, we'll do whatever's necessary.
- Thank you, doctor.
I await the word of Vigo.
I, Vigo...
...the scourge of Carpathia...
- No, you told me this, the scourge.
...the sorrow of Moldavia...
- Sorrows, I've heard all of this, yes.
...command you.
- Command me, lord.
The season of evil begins
with the birth of the new year.
Good.
Bring me the child,
that I might live again.
Yes!
Lord Vigo...
...I was wondering.
This woman, Dana,
is fine and strong.
Now...
If I was to...
...bring the baby...
...could I have that woman?
So be it.
On this day of darkness,
she will be ours.
Wife to you and mother to me.
Yes!
Thank you, lord!
Thank you.
- I mean, is she the killer or what?
- No, that's Rita Hayworth.
She was married to Citizen Kane
while they were doing this thing.
Right after they finished, she dumped
him for some polo player. Thanks.
I don't know why beautiful women
love horses. Do you love horses?
- No.
- You really don't have to stay.
I'm sure Peter will be back soon.
Oh, we don't mind.
Can you see okay?
Yep.
Oscar?
Oh, God!
Oscar!
Louis!
- What?
- It's Oscar!
- Oscar.
- Call 911 right now!
Oscar.
Oh, no.
Oh, God. No!
No!
- It was a ghost!
- No.
- No, that was Janosz.
- What?
- He took him.
- What? What's happening?
- What should we do?
- Where's the baby?
The museum!
- Where are you going?
- I've gotta get my baby!
We gotta find the guys.
As I explained before...
...we think the spirit
of a 17th-century Moldavian tyrant...
...is alive and well in a painting
at the Manhattan Museum of Art.
And are there any other paintings in
the museum with bad spirits in them?
You're wasting valuable time.
He's drawing strength from...
...a psychomagnotheric slime flow
that's been collecting under the city.
- Yes, tell me about the slime.
- It's very potent stuff.
We made a toaster dance with it.
And a bathtub tried
to eat his friend's baby.
A bathtub?
Don't look at me. I think
these people are completely nuts.
Oscar.
Sweetheart.
I thought I'd lost you,
that I'd never see you again.
Oh, baby.
Hello, Dana.
I thought that you might come.
You stay away from us, Janosz.
I mean it.
Oh, don't worry.
He will not be harmed.
He has been chosen...
...to be the vessel
of the spirit of Vigo.
And you will be the mother
of the ruler of the world.
Doesn't that sound nice?
No, it sounds ludicrous.
You stay away from him.
I mean it.
Well, I don't think we have
choice here, yes? Take a look.
It's not Gainsborough's
Blue Boy there, huh?
He is Vigo.
I don't care who he is.
You're not gonna take my baby.
Oscar!
Oh, you bastard!
Is this a big dinosaur
or a little dinosaur?
A skeleton?
Which way was it heading?
Wait a sec.
What was chasing you in the park?
The park bench was chasing you?
- I see.
- What?
Wait a second.
Lieutenant, I think you better
talk to this guy.
I'm busy here.
It's some dock supervisor
down at Pier 34.
What's the problem?
He says the Titanic just arrived.
Well, better late than never.
We're swamped. We've had more than
3000 calls since midnight last night.
We've got every man in uniform on
the streets and I'm still shorthanded.
Meter maids are chasing
ghosts all over midtown.
There's this shell thing over the
Museum of Art. We can't make a dent.
- Have you tried dynamite?
- We've tried everything.
What the hell's going on?
It's pandemonium out there.
- I know. We're working on it.
- While you're working on it...
...I'm going down as the mayor
who let New York...
...get sucked down
into the 10th level of hell.
We've got no choice.
Call the Ghostbusters.
Wait!
Now, I'm sure there's another way.
Jack, I spent an hour last night
talking to Fiorello La Guardia...
...and he's been dead for 40 years.
Now, where are the Ghostbusters?
They're not available.
What do you mean,
they're not available?
Well, I had them committed to the
psychiatric ward at Parkview Hospital.
- You what?
- They threatened to go to the press.
I was protecting your interests.
Yeah? Well, you can stop
protecting my interests.
You have exactly three minutes
to clear out. You're fired!
But the election...
- Remove this man.
- You're making a mistake.
- And get me the Ghostbusters!
- Mr. Mayor, come take a look at this.
What is it?
Have you ever seen
anything like that?
Somebody get me the Ghostbusters.
Then he put the baby in a carriage
and then levitated away.
Where did Dana go?
She was going to the museum
to get the baby.
Then there was an eclipse. The whole
town went dark and everybody's nuts.
It all fits. Vigo wants in
on the 21 st century.
He needs a human body to inhabit.
Oscar must be it.
- We're the only ones who can help.
- You bet we are.
It looks like a giant Jell-O mold.
I hate Jell-O.
Oh, come on.
There's always room for Jell-O.
Soon it will be midnight and the city
will be mine and Vigo's.
Well, mainly Vigo's.
Dana.
You and I have this terrific opportunity
to make the best of this relationship.
We don't have a relationship.
I know! Marry me, Dana.
Together, we will raise
Vigo as our son.
And let me tell you something here.
There are many perks in being
the mother of a living god.
I'm sure we could get
a magnificent apartment...
...a car, free parking.
Many marriages begin
with a certain amount of distance.
Yet I think that perhaps
you and I could learn...
...to love each other?
Yes.
I could learn.
Pull them.
Full neutronas.
Let's cook!
Save them.
That slime wall
is pulsing with evil.
It would take a tremendous amount
of positive energy to crack that.
And I doubt there's enough goodwill
left in this town to do it.
I just can't believe things are so bad
in this city that there's no way back.
Sure, it's dirty, crowded,
polluted, noisy...
...and there's people who'd just as
soon step on your face as look at you.
But come on!
There gotta be a few sparks of
humanity left in this burned-out burg.
We have to figure out a way
to mobilize it.
He's right. We need something that
everyone can get behind. We need...
A symbol.
Something that appeals
to the best in each of us.
Something good.
Something decent.
Something pure.
Kind of makes you wonder,
doesn't it?
Wonder what?
Whether she's naked
under that toga.
She's French. You know that.
Got it.
Ready with the speakers, Ray.
Slime blowers ready.
Okay. Internal audio set.
Internal electric set.
Slime blower primed and set.
Good slime. Good slime.
Is our slime in a good mood tonight?
I hope so.
She's a lot bigger than a toaster.
- All yours. Let's go.
- Thank you.
Testing, one, two. Hey, how many
people here are a national monument?
Raise your hand, please.
Oh, hello, miss.
- Let's frost it.
- It's slime time.
Beautiful.
Pilot controls are ready.
All right. It's getting late.
It's almost midnight. Let's go.
Here's something off the request line
from Liberty Island!
We gonna squeeze some New Year's
juice from you, Big Apple.
Man, I can't wait to see people's faces
when we come onshore.
This should really get the city's
positive energy flowing.
Keep kicking, Libby.
You make this work...
...we'll pop for a weekend in Vegas
with the Jolly Green Giant.
You look fantastic in this.
I was born to wear this stuff.
Boy, this equipment is heavy.
It's a love-fest, New York!
- Sing it out!
- Come on!
Come on, you sing!
- We're running out of time, Ray.
- Can't you go faster?
I'm afraid the vibrations
will shake her to pieces.
- We should have padded her feet.
- They don't make Nikes in her size.
Don't worry. She's tough.
She's a harbor chick!
Sorry! My fault!
Happy New Year.
Stay fit. Keep sharp.
Make good decisions.
Oh, good. Oh, good. Oh, good.
Okay.
Oh, it's you.
Okay, but I didn't know
you had your license.
Four minutes to go, and then...
...party times.
It's happening.
It's really happening.
No. No!
Go away from here!
- I love you when you roughhouse!
- Hit it, Mama!
- Drop the hammer on her!
- Go! Do it now!
- Oscar, look.
- Go away!
- Don't know who that is?
- Happy New Year.
He's Vigo! You are like
the buzzing of flies to him!
Oh, Johnny, did you back the wrong
horse. Will you hose him, please?
Hose him.
- One down.
- On the ground.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
- Oh, Oscar. Oscar.
Is he dead?
This slime is positively charged.
He'll wake up feeling
like a million bucks.
This gentleman is a little bit ripe.
That's all right, my friend.
I think I had an accident too.
Get him away!
Get a knife or something!
We gotta cut her out of this!
Okay.
All right. Now, listen. You gotta
stay right here. Don't move.
Uncle Pete's gotta go help your mom.
You stay here and don't say anything.
Hold it right there, deadhead!
You want a baby? Go ahead
and knock up some willing hellhound.
Otherwise, I'm giving you three
to get back in that painting.
One!
Two.
Three!
You got him! You got him!
That was really stupid.
Ray, can you move?
No. Are you okay?
No.
Venkman, how are you?
I'm fine.
No.
No! Oscar.
Please, do something!
Not so fast, Vigo!
Hey, Vigo!
Yeah, you.
The bimbo with the baby.
Didn't anybody tell you
the big-shoulder look is out?
You know, I have met
some dumb blonds in my life...
...but you take the taco, pal.
Only a Carpathian
would come back to life now...
...and choose New York.
Tasty pick, bonehead!
If you had brain one in that huge
melon on top of your neck...
...you would be living
the sweet life...
...out in Southern California's
beautiful San Fernando Valley.
Oh, darn it.
Oh, darn it.
Now we become one.
- Where's that singing coming from?
- People outside.
Excuse me. Ghostbusters.
I'm here with you, guys.
He's weakening! The singing
is neutralizing the slime!
I can move!
Oscar!
Oh, sweetie.
It's okay.
He's back in the painting!
All right, go find a shady spot.
Vigie, Vigie, Vigie.
You have been a bad monkey.
Ray, we'd like to shoot the monster.
Could you move, please?
- Ray.
- Ray.
- Ray!
- No!
I, Ray and Vigo,
shall rule the Earth!
- Be gone, you pitiful half-men!
- Now!
- I did it! I did it!
- That was great!
- I'm a Ghostbuster!
- I loved it!
- You all right?
- Come on, get up. Let's get this off.
Here.
Here we go.
- How do you feel?
- Groovy.
- You all right?
- Yes. Thank you, Peter.
Spread out, shorty.
I love you guys.
- I love all you guys.
- Great, Ray.
- And I love Venkman.
- Let's go.
- We gotta live with this?
- Real friendship.
Yeah.
Sir, are you all right?
Why am I drippings with goo?
You had a violent, prolonged,
transformative psychic episode.
Sorry we had to hose you there,
but you were out of control.
Hey, man...
...let me tell you something.
I love you.
- Yes?
- Yeah.
Well, I love you too.
Hey, fellas.
You wanna take a look at this?
Early Renaissance, I think.
Raphael or Piero della Francesca.
No, I believe it's one
of the Fettuccines.
