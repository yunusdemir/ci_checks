<font color=#0080FF>Please, help. Somebody, help.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Miss Flores.
- Professor Cale.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on in. When did you get in?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A couple of days ago.
I've been talking to some guides...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...hoping they might know the whereabouts our tribe.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Any luck?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, Looks like there's sufficient evidence to suspect
these people are out there...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...can be found and studied.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>At least, that's what I told the grant people.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>My man seems to think that the tribe was somewhere around here...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...between these two tributaries.
He'd found one of their markers.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Well, that's good.
- Yep, I think we may have a chance.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well you get me there and I'll shoot it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm counting on that.
That's why I hired you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And I'm glad you did.
I really appreciate it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, I wanted the best director I could get.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I think we'll make a good team.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You're a mess.
What happened to you?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, just a small attack of piranha.
Barely escaped with my life.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Somebody's up awfully early.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah, well, today's a good day.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Not every day my homegirl from SC get to direct her own documentary.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You ready?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I think so.
- That's right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Congratulations.
- Thanks. - Mateo?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I see you made this a pleasure cruise.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, you know me.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I don't mix business with pleasure.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, well, what about if we go up through here?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This way better.
If not, I cannot be responsible.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, well, it's only 55 kilometres out of the way.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shouldn't be a problem.
Better safe than sorry.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Morning.
- Morning.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Mateo, you understand me?
- Sure, I understand.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Great. I'm gonna need you to drift through that channel over there.
I wanna get some shots.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>As you say, chefe.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- For your approval.
- Thanks.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>So where's Westridge?
I know he checked in.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He's probably just catching up on his beauty sleep.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Careful!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Careful! Bordeaux. Fragile.
Expensive wine.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Christ!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Morning.
- Morning. How was your flight?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Actually, it was a bloody nightmare.
Ongoing, I think.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>One zoom lens.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You. Stow this in my room, will you?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Excuse me? I'm not the bellhop, I'm the production manager.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Then surely you can manage my things into my room.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- One pompous ass.
- No. In some cultures, that's a sign of friend and respect...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...when somebody asks you to carry their bags.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Respect this, sound man.
- It's not me who said that.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Mr. Westridge, Terri Flores.
- Terri, this is a pleasure.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Professor Cale lent me some of your films.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I thought they were very promising.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- God, it's hot. Are we on the equator?
- Well, thanks.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Welcome aboard, I guess.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I think he likes you.
- Oh, you felt that too?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Damn, Cale, you look like a little low-budget-ass Jacques Cousteau.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah, well, whatever the hell that means.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's good to see you, man.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Chefe, ready for Rio Negro.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>All right everybody.
Double check your gear, make sure it's all onboard...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...and pray you didn't forget your bug spray.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Our adventure begins 1000 miles from the mouth of the mighty Amazon...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...deep in the heart of the rain forest.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>From here, we will travel by river barge...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...up through shallow tributaries and unexplored backwaters...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...in search of the elusive people of the mist: The Shirishama tribe.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>One of the last great mysteries of the rain forest.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Is it just me or does the jungle make you really, really horny?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, no. I think it's the jungle.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm serious.
I've got, like, one thing on my mind.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Can I work, please?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Help!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Save me! I'm stranded.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>My boat is stranded in the roots.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Help me!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Help me! Hello!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Check it out, there's a dude on a boat over there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey! Pull over to his boat.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Stop.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We'll bring you onboard.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Thank the Lord for you.
Thank the Lord.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You hurt?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Are you okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>My propeller tore off in the roots.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We can't take you back to Manaus.
We're headed upriver.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>At the next village, I know the people.
They help me fix my boat.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I sorry if I be trouble for you.
- There's no need to apologise.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We're all at the mercy of our machines.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Your's broke.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Fish, river-style.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Not bad.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We're gonna have to get that on film next time.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr?
- Serone. Paul Serone.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Where you from, Mr. Serone?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Paraguay.
- Really?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I started out studying for the priesthood...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...but then I needed to see the real world.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>So I ended up in the jungle.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I seem to fit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Tell me, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Fail?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Who says I fail?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I didn't fail.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I'm sure you didn't.
- Well, what is your calling now?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Snakes.
- Snakes?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I catch them.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>For zoos and collectors.
Whatever they want.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Poaching?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Poaching is illegal.
May I ask what you are hunting?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We are not hunting or trapping anything.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We're making a documentary on the Shirishama Indians.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- The People of the Mist?
- That's right. You've heard of them?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I've seen them.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Really?
You think you could show me where that was?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You people saved my life.
This I can do.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I can show you exactly where I saw the Shirishama.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>So slurs every other river rat after
five whiskies in any bar in Manaus.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, lovey.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Five whiskies?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's breakfast on the river.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, does salad go well with fish river-style, Mr. Serone?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Salad would be perfect little baby bird.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Look at that.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What are those, fireflies?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's pretty, huh?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Family Lampyridae.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>On certain nights they all gather in the same tree and use their...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...night flashes to announce their readiness to mate.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, whose flashes, the males or females?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Both, actually.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The females with a series of short,
dainty feminine little flashes about eight per second.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The males respond with a series of long, drawn-out manly flashes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I like that.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>No pick-up lines, no misunderstandings.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Just instinct and nature.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I've missed you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Bloody racket.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, hey, hey! Don't touch my radio.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You know, I could cheerfully hire someone to kill you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A local tribesman, perhaps.
Fifteen dollars should cover it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I could just kill you for free right now.
- Oh, yeah?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- You and whose army?
- Your mama's.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>So are we getting close?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Just around this bend.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Perfect.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A snake totem.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This totem is Shirishama.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shirishama worship giant snakes, anacondas as gods, protectors.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There's a legend they pass down of a journey to a sacred lake.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>First you must pass a waterfall protected by warrior snakes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Once you pass those guardians...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...you travel through the land of the Shirishama...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...until you come to a wall so high, it blots out the sky...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Follow that wall for five days,
finally reaching its end the head of a giant anaconda.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- You know the story.
- Of course.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Beautiful, beautiful legend.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I believe, however, it's a legend of the Maku.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Also the Shirishama.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Not to my knowledge.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The water is high now, but the village was right here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You'll find them down this fork.
I know, I trap snakes for a living.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And I'm sure you're very good at it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I locate tribes for a living and I'm very good at that.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The water level is high, which by my calculations means...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...the areas to this side will be flooded...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...which would force our tribe, if they wanted to eat...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...to seek out higher ground.
So over here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Which way?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We'll go this way.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge, I wanna get a shot of you with the totem.
And, Gary, you're gonna roll sound.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Camera rolling.
- Action.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Our first piece of luck: A Shirishama idol
although this is the subject of some dispute.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I know what I know.
You can accept it or reject it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Leave me at the next village.
- Cut.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>With pleasure.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What the hell was that all about?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We're gonna go out and get some wild sound.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, just be careful.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We will.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>See you guys.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>All right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's unbelievable.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Gary?
- What?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>No, wait.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Do you hear that?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The silence.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Run, Gary!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- What was that?
- I don't know.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, shine the light over there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>These two are fortunate to be alive.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- What happened?
- You guys okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Man, you should have seen it.
What a shot.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This guy just blasted this thing coming right at us.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Wild boar.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gores with his tusks.
Goes for the eyes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Denise, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>From now on, everybody stays onboard at night, all right?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No exceptions.
- That's a smart idea.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, let's cut him up.
Food for a week.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Food?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- My turn?
- No, it's my turn.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No, it isn't.
- Yeah, it is.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, do you have control of this vessel?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Lie, if you must.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Goddamn rope's caught in the propeller.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, looks like I'm gonna have to cut us loose.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's maybe better I do it.
This river can kill you in 1000 ways.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I can handle it.
The only thing I'm really afraid of...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Okay.
- ...is the candiru acu.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Can do what?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Candiru acu. It's a tiny little catfish.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It swims up into your urethra, finds a nice warm spot...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...spreads its thorny little spines and refuses to budge.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You have to cut it out.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's it, man.
I'm getting the hell back to L.A.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Terri, something's wrong!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Cale?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- He's hurt. I'm going.
- Hold up, hold on. Hold it, I got it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hurry up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, guys. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Steven? Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Is he breathing?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Faster, come on.
Is he all right? Is he okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Hurry.
- Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Dan, be careful.
- What is it?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- It's okay.
- What is it?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Take his mask off.
Be careful, be careful.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get something for his head.
- Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- He's not breathing.
- Move him.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He's not breathing.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Something for his head.
- Here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There's something in the mouth.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, dear God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, damn. What's that?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A wasp.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Deadly.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Poisonous.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, he's still not breathing.
What are we gonna do?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Oh, God. How did this happen?
- Alcohol.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I've got whisky in my flask.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Quickly.
- What's that for? What are you... - ?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- He's breathing. He's breathing.
- That's it. He's gonna be all right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He seems okay. We should go now.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Man, that radio don't work.
We have no communication.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, I can't fix, okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- We can start now.
- No, no, no.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Fog.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We don't get this man to a hospital soon...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...we might as well throw him in the river.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Terri, we got lights.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Good. Mateo, we're just gonna double back.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Fighting the current, lose two days.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Cut back to this tributary, save us 50 miles.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This is the route you suggested we take yesterday.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yesterday for a different reason.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Now our concern is getting Professor Cale to a hospital...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...as fast as possible.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Fine.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I hope you know what you're doing...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...because I don't know about this dude.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What choice do I have?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What the hell is this?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, Terri, come here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This is the river you know?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>No, this is new.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>But no cause for panic.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not panicking, I'm just looking at this wall...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...that's blocking our way down this river that you know.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, let's just see what we can do.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, is that real dynamite?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- It's always good to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, you gotta be kidding me.
That thing must be there for a reason.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah, to keep us out.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm talking about upsetting the ecological balance of this river.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, look, I can blow it in 10 minutes...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...or if you feeling sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's up to you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Terri?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, for God's sake, blow the bloody thing.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Just give me 10 minutes, people.
Ten minutes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm gonna need some help.
Gary, get the little boat.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- There's something down there.
- That's right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No, I really mean it.
- I really mean it too.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hurry!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Goddamn it. These snakes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Babies. All of them babies.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, how do we get them off the boat?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, babies.
Come on, back to your mama. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Some of these aren't babies.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, there's more right here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Calm.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- You little shit.
- Serone, help him get it off.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Someone get this bloody thing off my freaking hand!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get it off!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>So young and yet so lethal.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get it off me. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Later, sweetie.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You knew there were snakes here, didn't you, Serone?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It was a pleasant surprise.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What about the fuel?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There's only one drum left.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's enough for about 100 kilometres.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>About a day's ride.
Well, that will have to do.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go, go. Back to your mother.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hi.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How's he doing?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- He's breathing normally now.
- That's good.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We'll get him home.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I just don't know what's going on, you know?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Serone's supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And he acts like he owns this river.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And we run into a barrier full of snakes.
s</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I mean, where is he taking us?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo. Mateo! Stop the boat.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Stop it.
- Why are we stopping now?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Could be fuel.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You know that boat?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There's lots of boats like that.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hello?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I get the distinct impression there's nobody home.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come with me.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hold up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm gonna get this on film.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- You don't need sound, do you?
- No, I'm not gonna go over there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go aft.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Serone?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Kind of spooky in here.
- You think so?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What the?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Goddamn.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Help me with this.
- What's that?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Treasures.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, be careful.
I put my camera in here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, that's it. Let's go.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, I'm coming. I'm coming.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What's all this?
And what about the fuel?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There wasn't no fuel.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Great.
- Where's Mateo?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I don't know.
He was right behind us.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I'm going back.
- Serone, go with him.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Maybe some other time.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Asshole.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Stuck in the middle of nowhere and now we've lost the driver.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, man. Stop playing.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Yeah.
- You okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm all right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I didn't see him.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How very reassuring.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Here, this is it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- This is all you found?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- What the hell is this?
- Anaconda skin.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- There's snakes out there this big?
- This skin is three or four years old.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Whatever's shed it has grown since then.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>But something like this has made a meal of our dear captain.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Snakes don't eat people.
- Oh, they don't?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Anacondas are a perfect killing machine.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>They have heat sensors.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A warm body like Mateo's in the water wasn't hard to find.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>They strike, wrap around you, hold you tighter than your true love.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And you get the privilege of hearing your bones break...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...before your power of the embrace causes yours veins to explode.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No, Mateo's probably just lost.
- Oh, wake up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Imagine something this big, captured alive.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's worth a lot of money, Gary.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Jesus.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Please, people...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...don't make me out a monster.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I didn't eat the captain Mateo.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, everybody.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We are not sure that Mateo is dead.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- So we'll just wait here till morning.
- Are you insane?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Where do you think he went, a walk in the woods?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Now listen. We've got to get the hell out of here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Oh, get a grip, Westridge.
- I've got a grip.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We are not leaving.
If it was you out there, you'd want us to stay too.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Listen, if it was me out there, I'd be dead, don't you see?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Just go into your cabin and lock the door.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Like a bad boy. All right. All right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Where are my shoes?
Where are my shoes?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- We're gonna aim some lights at the boat.
- That's a good idea.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Lights are a good idea.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not so sure he didn't eat the captain.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He sure looks satiated.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Think he's still alive?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No. Let's go to bed.
- Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danger.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You go on to the bed, I'm gonna catch up to you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Gary, come on.
- I'm just gonna talk to him for a second. Then I'll catch up to you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Well, hurry up, I'm scared.
- I'll be right there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- So it's out there, isn't it?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- And you know how to catch these things, right?
- That's right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>But you can't catch an anaconda by yourself.
You need a partner.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Capture alive maybe a million dollars, Gary.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Still no Mateo.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Keep it steady, Westridge.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Steady it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Man, what the fuck are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You can't catch anacondas without bait.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, my God.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Westridge, let's go.
- No, Westridge. Stop. Not on my boat.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Your boat?
You speak for everybody?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary? She speak for everybody?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, I mean, the way I figure it,
with Cale messed up, I mean the movie's off.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Why not salvage something?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You know, let's film Serone capturing a big snake.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Have you lost your mind?
- Have I lost my mind?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>No, I haven't lost your mind.
If anything, I'm completely lucid right now.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I think it's you guys who need to open up your eyes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yo, hold up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How we go from taking Cale to the hospital...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- ...to catching a goddamn snake?
- Do you know where you are?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You're in the middle of the jungle.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay, all you guys do is you question and you criticise...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...but just remember,
you don't know shit about the shit we're in out here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And neither do I, okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>But I guarantee you I know who does: This guy.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Paul has been here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And if we help him catch the snake...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...then he will help us get out of here alive.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And that, amigos, is not insanity.
That is common freaking sense.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, Gary, this... this isn't you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Honey, what did he do to you?
- Stop, okay? Stop.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Think about how much money this will be worth.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Imagine capturing something like this on film for the first time ever.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Let's be honest. What else are we supposed to do?
- I know what I'm gonna do.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm about to throw both of you son of bitches in the river myself.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I don't think so.
- I didn't want this to happen, people.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Let's go, Westridge.
- Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Occupy yourselves.
Play some cards.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Nobody move.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary! Gary, get the lights.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge, stop the boat. Stop it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get it over here, Westridge.
- You're gonna get us all killed.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's it, that's it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go for the eyes.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Go for the eyes. Blind it.
- Oh, man.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He's fishing for snakes.
The man gotta be crazy.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Just let it go.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge, come here.
Come down here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Where is it?
Where is it?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Don't move.
I'll get it with the tranquillizer.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Denise, get up here. Get up here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary, help me.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get out of there.
- Grab her, man.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm stuck.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Grab her hand.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The snake, it's in the water!
Let's go!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Gary!
- I got you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary, give me your hand.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Gary!
- No!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's no good to me dead.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, God! Oh, God!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gary!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>May the souls of the faithful departed...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...through the mercy of God rest in peace. Amen.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Westridge.
- How dare you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It was you who brought that snake.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You brought the devil.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>There's the devil inside everyone.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get your hands off her.
- Horrible.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Westridge!
- What?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Take my gear up to the pilot house.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not your bloody poodle.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What you say?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How dare you presume to order me about?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Presume?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How you like I presume to throw you in the river?
You like that presume?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Take it upstairs.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Thank you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Everyone else, don't move.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get back. Get back.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Terri, let's talk.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You want something?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I just want to talk to you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I was thinking about the myth.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I don't know if you know, but this...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This film was supposed to be my big break.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>And it's turned out to be a big disaster.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Anyway, I was just thinking...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...that maybe I could film you...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...capturing the snake and then...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...it wouldn't have all been for nothing.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I don't know. It could be dangerous.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Well, I know.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>But at least you'd be there to protect us.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You need protection?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's been a long time...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...since I had a woman.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You think I'm stupid?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm not stupid.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- It worked.
- Asshole in one.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Shall I hit him again to make sure?
- No. Let's throw him in the river.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Haven't we had enough of that?
- I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, let's just tie him up, okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>This was all one big setup, huh?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Mateo, you stranded...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...the shipwrecked boat, your route to the hospital.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>How can you forget about the wasp?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>See, what you do is not so hard.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I can trap a snake too.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>As smart as you are, you can't survive without me.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, we're gonna be home soon, okay?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I can't believe how good you're doing.
Hang in there, baby.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Is it hard to drive?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's a doddle, like driving a Cadillac Fleetwood.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Tell you what, I'll give you a driving lesson.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Right, black knobs: Up to go forward, down to go back.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Red knobs: Up to go fast, down to go slow.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Wheel: Four turns hard over, left and right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>If you get into trouble, turn off the ignition, all right?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Take it for a spin.
- That's it?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Take us back to civilisation.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit, no problem.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Take us back to...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...crisp sheets and hot showers.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The playoffs and a six-pack.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Eighteen holds of golf and a quadruple gin and tonic.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>L.A. Traffic and my cellular phone.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Don't start.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The waterfall.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's a beautiful sight, baby bird.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The legend was right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>What is this place?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, dear.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's absolutely beautiful.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- What the hell was that?
- I think we hit the bottom.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- We did.
- Hey.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Turn the wheel hard over left.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Right. Put it in reverse.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shut it down.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We got to winch ourselves loose.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Whoa, what are you doing?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I mean, we have to get in the water?
- We ain't got much choice.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I figure me and you go over here, wrap a rope around that tree.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You, you wrap a rope around that tree.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Pull it tight.
If not, we're stuck here forever.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We've got to make it quick, in and out.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I rather hoped I'd done my bit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's our rope right there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Just enough to go around the tree, right?
- Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We'll take this, get it around that trunk right there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Make sure it's secure.
- Roger.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Hate this.
- Last time I was in water like this...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...I was up all night picking leeches off my scrotum.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Aren't you gonna pray?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Never look in the eyes of those you kill.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>They will haunt you forever. I know.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I firmly resolve with the help of thy grace...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...to confess my sins...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...and to amend my life. Amen.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...baby bird.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hurry up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit. Back on the boat. Now.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on! Go.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Christ.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get on the boat. Go on, hurry.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Come on. Come on.
- Quick!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get up.
- Hurry, it's there!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>All right. Get up!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Over here, you fat-assed bastard.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Westridge, go up the rocks.
- Go!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get up the rocks!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>It's coming. Go!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Go get the gun.
- What are we gonna do?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go get it.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hurry up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, man.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Westridge, keep going, man.
- Danny, watch out!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny, move your arm.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Look out!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny! Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Westridge? Westridge?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, hurry up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm caught.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, Danny. Hurry up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>No!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny, hold on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hold on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You killed my warrior snake.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The dart.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>The tranquillizer's working. Get him.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Damn, the dart came out his back.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on, almost there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>All right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Baby?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>He's lost consciousness again.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm gonna try to get us out of here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- The tree knocked us loose.
- All right.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey, Terri, look.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>They might have some fuel for us.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Let's check it out.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Need some help?
- No, I'm cool.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I don't even wanna know what happened here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Me neither.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I hope they got some fuel, though.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Damn.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Those drums. Could be fuel.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>A snake skin.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Look, there's plenty of fuel in here.
- Welcome.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Time to wake up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Monkey blood.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I'm gonna kill you, Serone!
I swear to God, I'm gonna kill you!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Don't get me upset.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>See this?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Human bones.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>That's how it comes out.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Ashes to ashes...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, shit.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Oh, shit. Look.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Up, on three. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Gotcha.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Get loose.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Let's get the fuel and get the hell out of here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Don't worry, just go.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Run. It's coming for you.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny, where are you?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- There's a whole nest up there.
- I'll have him chase me up the smokestack.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- No, I've got the legs.
- Okay, we can trap it there.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Go. Go!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hey! Can you climb up the top?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I can use the rope.
- Hurry up, I think I can blow him up.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I'm about to light it.
- Go ahead, I'm at the top.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Danny!
- Okay.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Danny!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- Get out, the fuse is lit.
- Danny, wait!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Push it on the side! Hit the hinges!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Hurry up! You gotta jump!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>- I can't, it's too high.
- Just jump!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>I got you. Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Did we get him? Did we get him?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We got him.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>You all right?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Yeah.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>We should get the fuel...</font>
<font color=#0080FF>...so we can get the hell out of here, all right?</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Come on!</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Bitch.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Let's get out of here.</font>
<font color=#0080FF>Miss Flores.</font>
