[AlRCRAFT TAKlNG OFF]
NARRATOR<i>:</i>
<i>In the year 2 1 33...</i>
<i>...the world was plunged</i>
<i>into an era of devastation and chaos.</i>
<i>More than half the Earth's population</i>
<i>was killed off by nonnuclear global war.</i>
<i>It was only a matter of time</i>
<i>before the planet itself...</i>
<i>...would become utterly uninhabitable</i>
<i>and all life there would cease to exist.</i>
<i>Human beings searched</i>
<i>for their last seed of hope.</i>
<i>And when they could not find one,</i>
<i>they created one:</i>
<i>Olympus.</i>
<i>In this new utopia...</i>
<i>...those injured in the war</i>
<i>were reconditioned as human cyborgs.</i>
<i>International disputes</i>
<i>would be buffered...</i>
<i>...by a breed of genetically engineered</i>
<i>humans called bioroids...</i>
<i>...designed never to feel such emotions</i>
<i>as anger and hatred.</i>
<i>To further ensure peace,</i>
<i>Olympus also created ES.W.A.T...</i>
<i>...an elite force</i>
<i>with worldwide jurisdiction.</i>
<i>Yet with all gardens...</i>
<i>...this Eden was still susceptible to serpents</i>
<i>who seek its destruction.</i>
LANCE<i>:</i>
All right, gang, listen up.
We got a heavily armed group
holed up in an abandoned church...
...with top-ranking EU officials
as hostages.
Don't know who they are
or what they want.
Local police haven't taken them down,
so you know the drill.
You could be looking at combat cyborgs.
We move in at 2245 sharp.
Synchronize your watches
to 2230 on my mark. Three...
...two...
...one...
...mark.
A high-tech cyborg
wearing an analog watch. Well, look at that.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Has its own heartbeat, just like l do.
AEACUS<i>:</i> Yeah, well, the sound of it
will get your ass shot.
Tell him, Deunan. He's your partner.
[SCOFFS]
Well, l'll be.
You two are made for each other.

Who are you? What do you want?
Do you hear me? Answer me.
C YBORG<i>:</i>
All will be one. We will all be one.
l am Halcon.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
He's gonna blow. Move it.
[BRlAREOS YELLS]
Deunan, are you all right?
Briareos?
Briareos! Don't--
AEACUS<i>:</i> Deunan, stop.
-Let go.
Let go of me, goddamn it!
Briareos. Briareos!

LANCE<i>: Deunan?</i>
-l heard the call.
l'm already near B-47 right now.
Aren't you supposed to be
off-duty today?
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Yeah.
Things change.
LANCE<i>:</i>
<i>We're on our way.</i>
<i>Don't do anything stupid, Deunan.</i>
<i>You hear me?</i>
[WORKERS PANTlNG]
WORKER 1 <i>:</i>
Run. Run.
-What's happening?
-He got fired.
Next thing you know,
he grabbed a Landmate.
He's going to turn the place--
WORKER 2<i>:</i>
Oh, God.
[TlRES SCREECHlNG]
[SUPERVlSOR YELLS]
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Get up.
-Where's the kill switch?
SUPERVlSOR<i>:</i> On his back.
Unit 1 ready.
MAN<i>:</i>
Don't treat me like a fool!
[SCREAMS]
Goddamn you!
[MAN SCREAMS]
Goddamn you!
l swear to God l'll kill you!
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
You're late.
[GRUNTlNG]
Got it. l saw it.
MAN<i>:</i>
Come here, you little shit!
Damn it!
Get off of me! Damn it!
Get off! Shit! Get off!
[MAN SCREAMlNG]
You little bitch! Get off!
l can't move. Aah!
What are you doing?
Let me out of here.
You bitch!
Looks like we missed the party.
l told you to play it cool.
Didn't l?
Don't yell at me, he started it.
Who's the new guy?
Oh, yeah, right.
l have to introduce you.
Some other time, Lance.
Today is my day off.
LANCE<i>:</i>
Deunan Knute, meet Tereus.
Your new partner.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
What the hell are you thinking, Nike?
LANCE<i>:</i>
Watch your mouth, Deunan.
DEUNAN<i>:</i> Oh, l'm sorry, but did you forget
that my partner is in the hospital?
-l can't believe that you'd do this to me.
LANCE<i>:</i> Well, believe it.
Tereus is the only one whose
fighting potential compares to Briareos.
DEUNAN<i>:</i> That's not what l'm talking about
and you know it.
NlKE<i>:</i> Why does your new partner
look remarkably similar to Briareos...
...before he became a cyborg?
lsn't that what you want to know?
Yeah.
Come with me, Deunan.
NlKE<i>:</i> At first glance, you might not notice
anything different here.
This facility is, for the most part,
just like its predecessor.
We continue to create bioroids
from the very same DNA as you humans...
...genetically deleting negative emotions.
As you know, bioroids are,
more often than not, diplomats, emissaries...
...and, like your friend Hitomi,
ministers of political affairs.
But is this application limited?
We believe it is.
So we decided to produce bioroids
with high combat capabilities...
...to further uphold public order.
NlKE<i>:</i>
<i>Tereus is serving as our prototype.</i>
<i>He fights to preserve law and order.</i>
<i>And unlike humans, anger and hatred</i>
<i>will never influence his decision to fight.</i>
<i>The majority of his genetic code</i>
<i>was taken from Briareos.</i>
And you expected me
to be fine with that.
After analyzing combat data
from all soldiers in ES.W.A.T...
...we found him to be by far
the most qualified of all candidates.
And then there is
his Hecatonchire-class body.
Briareos is the only person in existence
who has ever adapted to it.
His physical and mental strength
are truly remarkable.
You were his former partner.
That's why we need you to assess
Tereus' capabilities. Am l quite clear?
Crystal. But l won't do it.
Well, it's not really your decision.
You bitch.
-Deunan.
-Hitomi, you're back.
l just got back
from the World Trade Expo.
l heard about Briareos.
[CELL PHONE RlNGlNG]
-Yes?
LANCE<i>: Deunan, it's Lance.</i>
<i>Briareos is waking up.</i>
l'll be right there.
WOMAN [ON TV] <i>:</i>
<i>As the prime minister of Olympus...</i>
<i>...I strongly advocate</i>
<i>a global security network.</i>
<i>This would entail bringing</i>
<i>all the world's surveillance...</i>
<i>...as well as communication satellites</i>
<i>under the control of Olympus.</i>
<i>This will enhance our capacity to monitor</i>
<i>and prevent synchronized terrorist acts.</i>
<i>This issue will be</i>
<i>our highest priority next month...</i>
<i>...at the Olympus</i>
<i>International Peace Summit.</i>
Hey, how about dinner tonight?
[SPEAKlNG lNDlSTlNCTLY]
Hey, what--? What are those things?
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
Hm?
l swear, you are always behind the times,
aren't you, Deunan?
l know, l know.
Here. Check it out.
lt's called a Connexus.
lt's the most advanced
personal multimedia terminal ever made.
Makes my life so much easier.
Here, try it on.
They are so hot right now.
Everybody's got one.
-lt's an amazing piece of technology.
-Wow.
And anyone can use it just by accessing
the free open-source codes.
That's the best thing about it.
Hey, go ahead
and open that message on the right.
What is it?
A birthday party?
HlTOMl<i>:</i> Promise me you'll come, okay?
DEUNAN<i>:</i> Of course.
So how old are you gonna be?
HlTOMl<i>:</i> Look, just because l'm a bioroid,
l am not gonna tell you my age.
[DEUNAN CHUCKLES]
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Briareos.
Hold it right there, honey.
You have to be gentle, all right?
After all, they just put him back together.
We can't have you
breaking him all up again. Get in there.
We should be able to be release him
in just over a week.
-Are you serious?
AEACUS<i>:</i> He's a lucky man.
Dr. Kestner's the chief professor
at the academy...
...not to mention the foremost expert
on cyborg medical science.
Your buddy's in good hands.
Hell, he's even my doctor. Sheesh.
[KESTNER CHUCKLES]
You're being too kind, l'm afraid.
l'll leave you all to your visit.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
So, what's new?
lt's like we thought it was.
The investigation at the church
revealed all the terrorists were cyborgs.
We've taken another look
at the five most recent terror incidents.
Four were carried out entirely by cyborgs.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Cyborg terrorists? What are they after?
That's what l'd like to know.
But we do have a couple of leads to go on.
We've found unidentified frequencies,
all of them in the surrounding areas.
Pattern looks like
a puppet-master program from the war.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
They're being brainwashed.
AEACUS<i>:</i>
lt's a possibility.
The problem is
there's a bunch of cyborgs out there...
...with poorly protected systems,
unlike us.
But if someone is manipulating
civilian cyborgs for terrorist acts--
LANCE<i>:</i> Things are gonna get a lot hotter
on our end.
What's worse, we have no idea
who we're dealing with or what they want.
-So get off your ass, we need you.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> What are you talking about?
l can't go on active duty like this.
When can all these wires come off?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Don't pull. You're not my doctor.
-Come on.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Let go of that.
[ALL LAUGHlNG]
AEACUS<i>:</i> Don't look at me,
l was trying to stop her.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Oh.
Here, l fixed it for you.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
This thing's tougher than l am.
You heard about the new guy,
Tereus, right?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Yeah. Before you came.
Well, l don't care what they say.
You're my partner,
no matter what happens.
[GUNFlRE]
[GRUNTlNG]
Deunan, get back!
[GRUNTS]
-Deunan, talk to me. Are you all right?
DEUNAN<i>:</i> Briareos.
Am l--?
Am l alive?
Yeah, you're alive.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Thank you.
l'll always protect you,
even if the world comes to an end.
l know you will.
l am Yoshino from Poseidon.
And l am Nike,
the chief of staff of Olympus.
Prime Minister Athena
has been expecting you.
ATHENA<i>:</i> As you can see, many of the
cyborgs involved in the terrorist incidents...
...were equipped with components
made by Poseidon.
l would like to know...
...what are your thoughts on the matter,
Emissary Yoshino?
YOSHlNO<i>:</i> We have tracked down
the cyborg parts in question...
...to the lab that manufactured them,
and shut it down immediately.
Other departments have enacted
countermeasures as well.
However...
...it would be regrettable
to draw connections...
...between these criminals and Poseidon.
So then you're saying Poseidon had nothing
to do with the latest terrorist attacks?
Prime minister, you're well aware...
...that Poseidon is the largest
industrial conglomerate in the world.
<i>Our profits come from trade</i>
<i>with other countries.</i>
<i>Siding with terrorists would give</i>
<i>no financial benefits whatsoever.</i>
lf Olympus were to boycott our products,
other countries would follow your lead.
Clearly, the negative impact on business
would not be in our best interest.
That may be, but we have issued
the same message...
...to all the businesses
that may have been involved.
We cannot afford to give Poseidon
special consideration.
lsn't one of the topics
at the peace conference...
...your desire to enhance surveillance...
...by controlling
international satellite systems?
ls it not?
This hyper-sheath contains the master
control program to our satellite network.
Consider it a gift.
-Cutting a deal, are we?
-Our contribution to global welfare.
Not something l'd expect to hear
from a business that makes tools for war.
lf l may ask,
what is your military's true purpose?
Don't you believe you can protect the world
without force?
l'm sorry, but we'll discuss such matters
another time.
Then we will look forward
to your favorable reply.
[PEOPLE CHATTERlNG]
-You know her?
-Yeah, known her for about 1 0 years now.
Great. Keep them coming.
MAN 1 <i>:</i> Happy birthday.

l hope all of you have a great time.
You look great. Happy birthday.
Yoshitsune, it's beautiful.
Hey, who's that? Looks like you've got
a surprise guest hiding over there.
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
Come on, get over here. Come on.
-Well, take a look at Deunan.
-You clean up nice.
-Hello.
MAN<i>:</i> Hey.
Where do you think her partner is?
Well....
Yeah. Okay, enough already.
[HlTOMl CHUCKLES]
-Here you go.
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.
Have a good time.
We have good things in store
for you tonight too.
-Hm?
-Just look over there.
What?
[DEUNAN GASPS]
Briareos.
-Does this mean you're okay?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Yeah.
They say l've checked out just fine.
But l might need to have them
look at my eyescope.
Oh, stop it.
Tonight we're also celebrating
Briareos' full recovery.
l had no idea.
[GASPS]
LANCE<i>:</i>
Happy birthday, Hitomi.
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
How lovely.
Thank you so much.
Oh, yeah. You two still haven't met yet,
have you?
Briareos, meet Tereus.
Well, Briareos at last.
lt's nice to meet you.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
ls this supposed to be a costume party?
This guy's wearing a mask
with my old face.
To be honest,
it wasn't exactly my own choice.
[BRlAREOS CHUCKLES]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Sounds a little like me too.
So l have my old partner back now?
l meant to talk to you about that.
Afraid l need you to stick with Tereus
a little longer.
-What?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> lt's okay, Deunan.
-l'll team up with Aeacus for a while.
-What do you mean?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
l saw your combat data with him. Not bad.
Wait, is this some kind of joke?
Because l'm not laughing.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Think about it, Deunan.
They fixed me twice.
Who are you gonna partner with...
-...if they can't do it a third time?
-Then l won't partner with anyone.
[GRUNTS]
Deunan.
Seems Briareos was pretty worried
about you.
Do l look like l care?
And so what if he is, anyway?
-Another one.
TEREUS<i>:</i> Better make that a coffee.
Espresso. With a shot of liqueur.
Look, Deunan,
l know you're not too fond of me...
...but l gotta admit that l'm really glad
they chose you as my partner.
All l ask is that you stick with me
a little longer.
What's the matter?
Did Briareos tell you
how l like to drink it?
No.
Go home.
l'll take you.
Leave me alone.
l get confused.
l get confused when l'm with you.
So do l.
[GUNSHOTS]
AEACUS<i>:</i>
Phew!
The Hecatonchires were giants
with a hundred arms, right?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
That's mythology...
...but now it's a system that can control
multiple external networks.
And you are the only one,
the only man they could find...
...who was able to adapt
to the H-class machine body.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Yeah, yeah. Lucky me.
lt sure sucks, don't it,
being a cyborg and all?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
lt has its drawbacks.
So, what you gonna do, pretty boy?
With Deunan, l mean.
Not too many girls out there
who'll stay with you...
...once you're more of a machine
than a man.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
lt hasn't crossed my mind.
Nobody ever said love was easy, pal.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
What about you? You got a girl?
Huh?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
She making you wear jewelry?
Oh, you mean this.
No, it's just my Connexus.
My daughter gave it to me.
She's got one to match it.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> What, your being a cyborg
isn't enough metal on you already?
Once you start you can't stop.
-You're an addict.
-Hey, don't break the merchandise.
REPORTER<i>: Leaders from</i>
<i>all over the world are arriving now...</i>

-Sorry.
-Ah, don't worry about it.
You and l are gonna be partners,

No matter what happens between us,

And l got you.
You'll have to be faster than that.
<i>This worldwide peace summit</i>

<i>Prime Minister Athena is in. We are green.</i>
Okay.
All units, look alive. Here we go.
AEACUS<i>:</i>
Looks like it's starting.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
All right. Let's hope nothing happens.
Don't sweat it, partner.
lf the shit hits the fan,
ES.W.A.T. will handle it.
Hell, that's why they pay us the big bucks,
isn't it?
NlKE<i>:</i> And by merging
each country's satellite systems...
...we will create a unified
global communications network.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we believe this will quell conflicts...
...and terrorist attacks
before they ever happen...
...helping ensure peace
for future generations.
Obviously, this was simply an overview
of the proposed global security network.
For the good of mankind, l urge you all...
...to place your countries' satellites
under Olympus' control.
MAN 1 <i>:</i> The recent incident
that occurred in our country...
...was handled by the Olympus ES.W.A.T.
in a very expeditious manner.
A truly secure network, as you propose,
would require full cooperation of every--
My country already has the means
to protect itself from terrorism...
...without having to rely on
Olympus' support.
Or perhaps your country might have things
you don't want anyone else to see.
What do you mean?
Would you care to elaborate on that?
Sources indicate that your country
supports several regional conflicts--
That's ridiculous!
How dare you make such an accusation.
MAN 2<i>:</i> Enough of this. Why should Olympus
be in control of the satellite systems?
-How do we know bioroids can be trusted?
MAN 3<i>:</i> l agree.
MAN 4<i>:</i> This discussion
has nothing to do with race.

As a result of our debate
at the Olympus Assembly...

...with one notable exception.
Certain cyborg parts.
Thank you, prime minister,
for your consideration.
l'll let our headquarters know
immediately.
We've received the latest report
on the attack at Tartaros Conference Hall.
-There's something that concerns me.
-What is it?
According to this, one of the rioters
was reported to have said, ''l am Halcon.''
What? That's impossible.
l-- Halcon is nothing more
than a memory.
There's no way they could be involved.
lD verified.
Thank you.
[GRUNTlNG]
TEREUS<i>:</i>
Need a partner?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
l have a partner.
Just not the one you used to have.
[BOTH GRUNTlNG]
-Whoa. Not bad there, kid.
-Ooh.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Not bad for a copy.
[BRlAREOS YELLS]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Anything happens to her,
l hold you responsible.
Can't believe
he just kicked his ass like that.
YOSHlTSUNE<i>:</i> We've determined
the unidentified data frequency...
...detected during the incident were
being transmitted by the robotic doves.
We believe they were responsible.
They transmitted a virus program
to the cyborgs, triggering the uprising.
What we don't know...
...is how regular non-cyborg humans
were involved in the attack as well.
But the investigation is still under way
and we should know more soon.
Right now, evidence suggests
cyborg terrorists were behind this attack.
Whether or not Aeacus was collaborating
with the terrorists remains to be seen.
At the same time,
we can't ignore the possibility...
...that ES.W.A.T.'s
virus-protection programs for cyborgs...
...may have been compromised.
So effective immediately, we will suspend
participation of cyborg troops.
ES.W.A.T. OFFlCER 1 <i>:</i> What?
-This is bullshit.
-Non-cyborgs were involved as well.
-You treat us like criminals for this.
LANCE<i>:</i> As long as the enemy's objectives
remain unclear, we have no choice.
That is all. Dismissed.
ES.W.A.T. OFFlCER 2<i>:</i>
Man, forget this. l'm out of here.
ES.W.A.T. OFFlCER 3<i>:</i>
l don't need this crap.
ES.W.A.T. OFFlCER 4<i>:</i>
l'm with you.
Yoshitsune.
Yeah?
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Would you run some tests on this?
Some sort of biochip?
Where did you get this from?
Off one of the rioters.
Just check it out for me, will you?
-No problem. l'll check it out.
-Thanks a lot.

[SlRENS WAlLlNG]
DEUNAN<i>:</i> The unidentified data frequency
wasn't detected in that area.
So they ruled that out as the cause.
l think they wanna conduct drug tests
and a psych exam on him.
So where is he now?
He's here, in the isolation ward.
Did you see him?
He didn't want me to, so no.
l see.
-l can do that.
-Of course.
l'll go on my rounds and be right back.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Turn around.
Okay. Be gentle.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
This birthmark.
Briareos had the same one.
What's happening to him, Tereus?
l feel like l can't help him.
YOSHlTSUNE<i>:</i> That biochip you wanted me
to check out? Part of a Connexus.
Take a look at this.
l put a Connexus on this lab rat.
Watch what happens
when l transmit the same frequency...
...from one of the robotic doves
to this rat.
Whoa.
lt's like he has no control.
And now he can be controlled.
When activated, the Connexus emits
a signal that stimulates nerve tissue.
ln other words,
it can potentially be used...
...to manipulate
both humans and cyborgs at will.
That would explain why non-cyborgs
were involved in the attack.
Exactly.
So that means Aeacus
was innocent, then.
Just being used
like the people in the riots were.
This thing that's happening
isn't just some kind of cyborg virus.
This is something much bigger.
Then the terrorist attack on Tartaros
was just some kind of test.
l don't know how, but we gotta
get these things off the street.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
ls it true?
Did l really attack Deunan?
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
Mm-hm.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
What's happening to me?! What?!
They don't know,
and that's why she's worried.
She wants to see you.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
No.
Not now.
Maybe there's something l can do.
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
Richard Kestner.
He's been with the Olympus
Science Academy since 21 35...
...but he worked for Poseidon
before that.
BRlAREON<i>:</i>
Poseidon?
Keep going. What else does it say?
Let me try to access
Olympus' host computer.
Okay, l'm in Gaia.
Chief Technician of New Technology
Elizabeth Xander.
Halcon Laboratory.
BRlAREON<i>:</i> Halcon?
HlTOMl<i>:</i> Yeah.
Give me a sec.
''No data selec--'' lt's been erased.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
ls Kestner behind this?
That's impossible.
Kestner never would have been able
to remove that amount of data...
...from a global network on his own.
Someone else must be behind this.
BRlAREON<i>:</i>
Kestner. Poseidon.
Hitomi, cover your ears. And get back.
Briareos, no! Stop it.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
l need to pay the good doctor a visit!
HlTOMl<i>:</i>
Please, don't do this! You could get--
[PULSE SQUEALlNG]

Doctor, Levels 4 and 6 have been cleared!
Hey! Where do you think you're going?
We have to evacuate the hospital.
-You get out, l have to find someone. Go.
-You can't. We have to leave.
Aren't you listening to me?
Leave me alone.
[SlRENS WAlLlNG]
Hang on.

<i>Attention, citizens:</i>
<i>The Connexus is now considered</i>

<i>If you are a Connexus user...</i>

l want enforcement measures
taken as early as tomorrow.
Of course.
MAN<i>:</i> Nike.
-What is it?
MAN<i>:</i> Briareos has escaped
from the hospital.
He's taken Vice Minister Hitomi hostage.
LANCE<i>:</i>
You're all aware of Briareos' capabilities.
Don't you ever let your guard down.
All right, move out.
Deunan Knute.
l want you to withdraw
from this assignment.
-What are you talking about?
-That's a direct order. You understand me?
Remain here on standby. Got it?
PlLOT [O VER SPEAKER] <i>: Pull your vehicle</i>
<i>to the side of the road immediately.</i>
<i>Surrender or we will take hostile action.</i>
-What do we do?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Do what they want.
-<i>I repeat, stop your vehicle immediately.</i>
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Just not right away.
Thanks for the lift.
-Do you want a gun?
-Don't need one.
OFFlCER<i>:</i> We've taken the hostage
into protective custody.
The fugitive's whereabouts
are still unknown.
So where is he? Where did he go?
Are you asking me?
How would l know?
l don't care if you're the vice minister
or not, you're aiding and abetting a fugitive.
And that makes you
just as guilty as he is.
OFFlCER [O VER RADlO] <i>: It looks like</i>
<i>the fugitive took Harbor Way Number 4...</i>
<i>...and exited somewhere near Cygnus.</i>
<i>We're currently inspecting all vehicles</i>
<i>within a 1-kilometer radius of the area.</i>
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> l see that you're going
for that bachelor-pad look.
l can tell you live alone.
Oh, no.
l am never exactly alone.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
What have you done to my body?
KESTNER<i>:</i>
lt's impossible to control your body...
...using data frequencies
from the outside.
Fortunately,
your little incident the other day...
...gave me the perfect opportunity
to add a rather special feature...
...to that Hecatonchire body of yours
at no extra charge.
Nanomachines.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
You did what?
They're ravenous feeders,
and how they feed off of you.
lt's a fascinating program, really...
...activated the instant
that your adrenaline levels...
...rise just beyond a certain point.
You do realize that the hacking incident
you caused was all part of the plan.
You see, l found
it would be very difficult...
...to infiltrate the main control room
of the satellite command center.
So l performed a little trick
on their backup module.
All that was needed then
was to crash the main system.
And you did that wonderfully.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Why are you doing this?
Do you know why this world
can never exist without bloodshed?
lndividual differences, of course.
Different hearts, different minds.
That is the essence of all conflict.
But if our world was converted
to a single, united consciousness....
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> You're the one.
You're the one behind the attacks.
No. l have comrades all over the world.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Don't fuck with me!
Oh, l've already done that.
Now onto the others.
[BEEPlNG]
MAN<i>:</i> System error.
We've lost control of the satellites.
WOMAN<i>:</i>
All links to the satellites are cut off.
What the hell is going on?
-Backup system's out too.
-Try it again.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> What are you trying to do?
KESTNER<i>:</i> lntegration...
...and natural selection.
Those that cannot be integrated
will be eliminated.
Thanks to the Connexus
and the global satellite network...
...mankind will be united
once and for all.
lmagine a world without
misunderstanding or discrimination.
The elimination of all human conflict
and the banishment of war.
My vision and Halcon's ideals
will finally become our reality and truth.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Halcon.
MAN [O VER RADlO] <i>:</i>
<i>The global security network is down.</i>
<i>We've lost control of the satellites.</i>
<i>Repeat, we've lost control of the satellites.</i>
They waited for the satellites to unite
before hijacking them.
Even the attack on the peace summit
must have been thoroughly designed.
Prime minister, if they use--
lf they transmit that signal to Connexus
via satellites....
-Nike, issue an alert to the alliance nations.
-At once.
KESTNER<i>:</i>
Don't worry.
My friend,
in but a moment you will understand.
Mechanical or not,
our bodies are just vessels.
Oh, l'm afraid this bullet is not meant
for you, my cyborg accomplice.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Kestner. Don't do it!
KESTNER<i>:</i>
We will all become one.

Send a medical team to street level.
OFFlCER [O VER RADlO] <i>:</i>
<i>We will continue pursuit.</i>
LANCE<i>:</i>
<i>Briareos is still on the run.</i>
<i>He's considered armed and dangerous.</i>
<i>If he resists...</i>

<i>Headed south on Cygnus Street.</i>
<i>I repeat, Briareos is still on the run.</i>
l'll always protect you,

-l need your help.
-You're gonna go after him, aren't you?
When you find him, use these.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
What are they?
YOSHlTSUNE<i>:</i>
Parasite antitoxins.
They were developed during the war as
a countermeasure against cyber-terrorism.
lt's like shock treatment for cyborgs.
lt should help him regain consciousness.
lf he starts to lose it,
shoot this into his nervous system...
...from the back of his neck,
if you can get it there.
So this can save him?
lt's just an emergency measure,
but it's better than nothing.
Thanks for doing this.
l owe you one.
Good luck.

But remember, they're not terrorists,
just ordinary civilians being manipulated.
No excessive force unless you have to.
But don't forget
these riots must be stopped.
<i>By any means necessary.</i>
Steady. Steady.
Son of a bitch! How's this happening?
TEREUS<i>:</i> Everyone who's hooked

What do we do?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
This way.
-l've got signals everywhere.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> We have to destroy the source.
''Halcon,'' that's what Kestner called it.
Poseidon is behind all this...
...and they're hiding something.
Poseidon's ship and their emissary

We need to see your emissary.
Who are you? What do you want?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
We need to know two things<i>:</i>
What is Halcon and where can we find it?
Halcon is no more.
But once it was Poseidon's
leading research-and-development lab.
<i>Professor Elizabeth</i> X<i>ander</i>
<i>was the head of research.</i>
<i>They designed and developed</i>
<i>rehabilitation devices...</i>
<i>...for those who had sustained</i>
<i>severe head trauma in the war.</i>
<i>Using artificial intelligence</i>
<i>and cyborg technologies...</i>
<i>...they saved hundreds of the wounded.</i>
<i>Almost like a god.</i>
<i>Their pride led them to develop</i>
<i>a distorted sense of reality.</i>
Did Halcon Laboratories
invent the Connexus?
l don't know.
What l do know is this<i>:</i>
Mind control was their obsession.
And like any obsession,
it needed to be stopped.
You could say it was fate.
<i>Elizabeth</i> X<i>ander was killed</i>
<i>in an accident.</i>
<i>Shortly after,</i>
<i>we decided to put an end to Halcon.</i>
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
<i>But you didn't put an end to it.</i>
<i>You gave it new power.</i>
<i>You gave Kestner purpose.</i>
Tried to cover it up
and instead gave it new life.
Look what you've done,
all to protect your profits.
Halcon's still alive
and you know where it is.
Tell me!
YOSHlNO<i>:</i>
This is Halcon's zero-gravity plant.
lt's been abandoned for years...
...but we've traced the frequency
back to this location.
You intercepted our vessel
on our way there.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Good. Then l'll finish the job you started.
All l need to know is
are you gonna get in my way?
Because l'm going to Halcon...
...and tear it apart piece by piece.
You won't do it alone.
Tereus and l are going too.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Then let's move.
YOSHlNO<i>:</i> We can supply you with
the latest weapons and a small task force.
Consider it a goodwill gesture.
This is Arges.
He will take care of the rest.
We'll take you there.
And l got something you'll need.
YOSHlNO<i>:</i>
A human, a bioroid and a cyborg.
Only in Olympus.
Good luck to all of you. You'll need it.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Excellent.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
lf it wasn't pink, l'd be riding it.
Not to be mean,
but pink was never your color.
Look, we're gonna stop the Halcon signal
and you'll be fine, l know it.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
lt's worth a shot.
ARGES<i>:</i> The target should be in sight soon.
All Landmates, prepare for takeoff.
Oh, my God. That's it.
lt's a hell of a lot bigger than l imagined.
Halcon's main computer

Our unit will escort three Olympus
Landmates to Halcon's central core.
No idea what's gonna be inside.
But that doesn't matter.
We're gonna put an end to this now.

DEUNAN<i>:</i> Briareos?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Part of Xander still lives.
You have to find it.
Deunan.
XANDER<i>:</i>
<i>Help me, please.</i>
KESTNER<i>:</i>
<i>You cannot help her.</i>
[GASPS]
[DEUNAN GRUNTlNG]
You can try to plug me into
whatever program you've got planned...
...but let me tell you,
l won't let you do it.
XANDER<i>:</i>
Hmm.
[GASPS]
[BRlAREOS GRUNTlNG]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Deunan...
...use this.
Go.
XANDER<i>:</i>
How l admire your spirit.
[GRUNTlNG]
Tereus.
Xander, you've got to listen.
You're not real,
you're not the same anymore.
l know.
You're like l am. We're just copies...
...but neither you....
Neither you nor l have should be used
by anybody else.
[GASPS]
[XANDER CHOKlNG]
[DEUNAN GASPS]
Deunan.
l've reset Halcon's signals,
but you'll need to hurry, Deunan.
Xander, you can't let him
use you anymore.
Deunan, destroy me while you still can.
lt's the only way
to stop the Halcon system.
Kill me before...
...Kestner's machine
takes control of me...
...again.
Deunan, shoot her.
l'm sorry.
Xander.
l have release. l am free.
He has no hold any longer.
Thank you.
And l'm so, so...
...sorry.

<i>This is Sector J-4.</i>
<i>The rioters have all started collapsing</i>
<i>en masse.</i>
<i>They've just stopped moving.</i>
OPERATOR 1 <i>:</i> The unidentified data
frequency has stopped transmission.
OPERATOR 2<i>:</i>
The rioters appear to be collapsing.
What the hell's going on?
Someone must have gotten through.
[DEUNAN PANTlNG]
-Are you--? Are you all right?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Yeah.
l'm okay, Deunan.
Are you sure
Kestner has no hold on you?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> There's only one person
who's ever had a hold on me.
[TEREUS GRO ANS]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
You're not gonna like this.
[SCREAMS]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Get up.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Where's Arges? Where's the ship?
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Get back.
[TEREUS GRUNTS]
Leave me here.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i> Get up. The backup
always follows the point man.
l'm just a bioroid.
-They can make another one.
-Don't say that.
We're not gonna leave you, Tereus.
You're coming with us.
No one can replace you.
We need you.
[AlRCRAFT APPRO ACHlNG]
Arges.
ARGES<i>:</i>
What are you waiting for? Move your ass!
Come on, you heard him.

Come on, come on.
Let's go!
[ALL GRUNTlNG]
ARGES<i>:</i>
Nice of you to join us.
[PEOPLE GRO ANlNG
AND MUTTERlNG]
Where am l?
[PEOPLE GASPlNG]
MAN<i>:</i>
What in the world...?
Man seems to yearn
for his own destruction.
lt seems so.
Yet somehow his spirit
always pulls him back from the brink.
Perhaps they are a race worth saving.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
You're a good partner...
...Deunan.
l'll always protect you,
even if the world comes to an end.
[BRlAREOS CHUCKLES]
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Now, where have l heard that before?
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
Somebody told me that once.
BRlAREOS<i>:</i>
Must have been a smart guy.
DEUNAN<i>:</i>
He's all right.
You okay?
Yeah, l'm all right.
He was her partner first.
She'll have him and l'll find my own girl.
ARGES<i>:</i>
Whatever. Maybe they'll make one for you.
Next stop, Olympus.
