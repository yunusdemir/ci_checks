Here, Charlie,
more fortune cookies.
Thanks.
What?
Next week we'll be selling
- Sanyo remote control VCRs for $299?
- Look, it's Dad.
Oh, no!
I'll go broke.
To give away Mitsubishi
giant-screen television sets
for $1,299!
Oh, no!
We won't be undersold
on microwaves,
video recorders, ovens...
Mom, you're not looking.
Please turn that off.
Mom, when are you going
to stop being mad at Dad?
I mean, how do you think
that makes me feel?
I have certain unresolved
feelings about your father.
I don't trust him.
And I hate those commercials.
All right, forget it.
We don't have time for
another heart-to-heart.
Come on.
You have to get dressed.
Oh.
I want you to understand,
- it's insulting...
- Watch your hair.
...for him to go from
me to that bimbo.
Do you think he
really loves Janet?
Maybe he's just smashed
too many fortune cookies.
Mom, give me a break.
He's missing the reunion because of you.
You know he's dying to go.
Yeah, well, at least we won't
both have a miserable time.
Let me see.
What do you think?
You are a very hip chick.
God, you look like you've stepped
right out of Life magazine.
Oh, I don't know.
What if nobody else
there is dressed like this?
So?
Well, I don't think
I want to go.
- Mom...
- Everybody's just going to say,
"Hey, where's crazy Charlie?"
Lots of people are
separated and divorced.
Not from the guy with
the lowest prices in town.
I feel ridiculous in this dress.
I think I wanna go change.
Why are you so nervous?
What's the matter with you today? Come on.
I don't know.
Reunions do funny things to people.
- Oh, Peggy Sue. Beth, hi.
- Hi.
Hi, Maddy.
- How are you? - You two look
just like that soap commercial.
Which one's the mother?
And which one's the daughter?
You took this seriously.
You're a real blast from the past.
It was Beth's idea.
I wish I had the nerve
and the figure.
Hi.
Peggy Sue Bodell.
- Oh. Here.
- Mom.
You know, Beth's boyfriend
is with the band.
- It must run in the family.
- What does?
You and your mother.
You both seem to fall for musicians.
Mom, look.
Oh, God.
- Um...
- It's okay. Come on.
Look!
Peggy, why don't you find a table?
We'll see you in a little while.
Sure.
God, Mom,
that picture's great.
Come on.
Let's get a table.
- Is this good?
- Fine.
I'll be right back.
You'll be all right?
- Sure.
- All right. Thank you.
We're going to do
a little medley for you.
Come on.
Pose like the picture.
What?
Oh.
- Oh, my.
- You like it?
Well, you know, I figured
everybody has a gold Rolex,
so I'd have one specially
made in platinum.
What a wonderful idea.
- How are you?
- I'm fine.
- How many children do you have?
- Oh, I don't have any.
You don't?
Oh, I thought you did.
- No, no, how many do you have?
- I have four.
- Four?
- Four, yeah.
Oh, Maddy,
I'm so happy for you.
- I know, and I love them.
- How is Peggy Sue doing?
Oh, she was a mess right
after they separated,
but I think she's
coming out of it.
- Seems to be pretty friendly now.
- Oh, I'm so glad.
Sometimes it's easier
when you hate them.
- How about a little dance, princess?
- Oh!
Walter!
- How are you?
- Good. Good.
- Nice to see you. See you later.
- Yeah.
Aren't you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
I was once.
Richard?
Richard Norvik?
Oh!
I didn't recognize you.
Well, you look terrific.
You look exactly the same.
I feel ridiculous.
I only did this for tonight.
It's adorable.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry. Peggy Sue Kelcher,
this is my wife Sharon.
How nice to meet you!
Oh, why don't you sit?
But call me Peggy,
Peggy Bodell now.
So, where's Charlie?
I was in town
about a year ago,
and I turn on the television,
and I see crazy Charlie.
It really made me laugh.
Well, Charlie won't
be here tonight.
Um...
We're getting divorced, actually.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Mr. Norvik! Mr. Norvik.
Richard.
Doug Snell, Merrill Lynch.
I read about that Cordex
deal in Business Week.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much, Doug.
Hey, Peggy, how are you?
How's Charlie?
- Dougie, over here!
- Hey, Terry!
- Thank you, Doug. Thank you very much.
- Hey, call me.
Madeline Hutton and Arthur Nagle
were high school sweethearts.
Married right after graduation,
they're still together.
Maddy, Arthur,
how does it feel
to have missed the
sexual revolution?
What?
What kind of question is that?
That doesn't have anything to
do with the reunion, Delores.
Take it easy, kitten.
Take it easy.
Well,
welcome to the singles scene.
I don't know how you do it.
I've never even dated
anybody but Charlie.
Well, it's not that bad, really.
You just have to think
of men like houses
and trade upward.
I always thought that you and
Charlie had a really great marriage.
Oh, I think we did.
We just got married too young
and ended up blaming each other
for all the things we missed.
So he started having affairs,
and you started
getting depressed.
Well, you just should have
left here years ago like I did.
It's not so bad.
I've got two great kids.
I've got my own business.
Still, if I
knew then what I know now,
I'd do a lot of things differently.
Your damn computers
put me out of business.
- No, Mr. Norvik.
- He's drunk.
You're a billionaire,
and I'm a goddamned failure.
The bakery's doing very well.
And you manage it?
I own it.
I remember that dress.
Rosalie?
- Hi.
- Oh, no.
I remember that locket, too.
You were so excited.
I think you showed it
to the whole school.
You have an incredible memory.
It's beautiful.
Does it open?
Yes.
These are my children.
Oh, they're so cute.
Of course,
they're not babies anymore.
Oh, but you were married
when you were three, right?
God bless you.
The best thing about
being a dentist.
Pure pharmaceutical grade.
Couple of lines of this,
I could drill my own teeth.
Hi.
Who's the guy with the eyes?
Michael Fitzsimmons.
I used to have such
a crush on him in school.
- Peggy. Hi.
- Hi.
God, that Walter Getz
can still dance.
Oh, your first boyfriend.
Come on, tell me,
any sparks left?
Oh, well, who knows?
I mean...
Remember,
whatever Walter wants...
Walter Getz!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sharon Norvik,
this is Carol Heath and Maddy Nagle,
my oldest and my
dearest friends.
Sharon is married to Richard.
Oh, lucky lady.
Michael Fitzsimmons.
Is he here?
No. I asked Rosalie.
She couldn't track him down.
That's too bad.
He must have been quite a guy, huh?
Yeah.
Do you know he's the
only boy in high school
I wish I'd gone to bed with.
Only one?
Well, besides Charlie.
Hmm.
I hope the sales of
your book go very well.
Is there anything anecdotal
you'd like to leave us with?
Yeah.
Every dog has its day.
Meaning what?
Peggy, would you please
rescue Richard?
Ask him to dance.
- Richard?
- Yes?
Would you like to dance?
Well, of course I would.
- So are we through now? Good.
- No.
From sniveling runt to
pompous ass in 25 years.
That's quite an accomplishment.
I really cannot get over this.
Do you know that the only
time people like Delores Dodge
used to pay any attention to me
was to laugh at me or insult me.
- You know that guy Doug Snell...
- Yeah.
...who shook my hand
when we walked in here
used to call me
four-eyed worm.
Well, you showed them all.
You're rich and famous
and successful,
and you have a beautiful wife.
You were always friendly to me.
I appreciated that.
Whoa!
Oh, Richard.
It's crazy Charlie,
the appliance king!
Hey, Charlie!
Crazy Charlie!
- I don't believe it.
- Look at you! You look great.
How are you doing?
Great.
So, uh, this is the reunion?
Wonderful.
This is it.
Are you and Peggy still talking?
Is it amicable?
She hasn't changed at all, Charlie.
Your daughter's a real doll.
Why, I ought to...
You guys know
any Chuck Berry?
Hello.
Hello.
Hi-ho!
Can I have your attention please?
Listen up. Can I have your attention?
Well, I know everybody's
having a great time,
but now,
you have to get ready
for that moment you've
all been waiting for.
Dad?
Hi.
You don't know what that moment
is because we didn't tell you.
The reunion committee has
selected a king and a queen.
All right, now,
let's get back to business.
You know, the reunion committee
has given this a lot of thought
and decided on two people
who best represent
the spirit of Buchanan High's
class of '60!
What are you doing?
The king is someone
who in more ways than one
has come a long,
long way since he left here.
And we are especially proud
to welcome him back.
Richard Norvik!
Come on up here, King Richard.
Are you okay?
I demand a recount!
That's got to be Getz.
First you got to
learn how to count.
Hold me back!
Hold me back!
Uh...
Well, I just want
to say thank you.
Sharon and I, uh,
feel real welcome.
We're having a great time.
Boy, high school looks
really good from up here.
And I just want to say it's
good to be back. Thanks a lot.
Now, every king deserves
a queen and...
Over here!
Not you, Getz.
Life of the party.
But when we sent
out the invitations
we didn't mention anything
about this being a costume party.
Perhaps we should have, because
just looking at her brings it all back.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you our queen,
Peggy Sue Kelcher Bodell!
Come on up here, Peggy Sue.
I can't do it.
Yes, you can. Now, go on.
You can do it.
Go on.
You can do it.
<i>Peggy</i>
<i>My Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Oh, I love you, gal</i>
<i>I love you, Peggy Sue</i>
Peggy Sue!
<i>Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Oh, how my heart
yearns for you</i>
Daddy.
<i>Oh, Peggy</i>
<i>My Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Oh, and I love you, gal</i>
Congratulations.
<i>I love you, Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Yeah, Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Peggy Sue</i>
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
<i>Oh, Peggy</i>
<i>Yeah, my Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Well, I love you, gal</i>
<i>And I want you, Peggy Sue</i>
<i>Peggy Sue</i>
Mom!
Mom?
Oh, my God!
Now, hold your arm up.
Would you like
your Twinkie now?
Blood.
Blood.
- Charlie?
- Bl-bl-blood.
Bl-bl-bl-blood.
I vant to suck your blood.
I also vant to suck
your Twinkie.
- Am I dead?
- No. You are the undead.
Come on, let's have it.
You hate them anyway.
Young man!
Would you stop that?
Hey, I just made a
deposit in your bank.
Now I want to make
a withdrawal.
I think it's time for
your next class. Go on.
I'm a little worried about
the side effects.
Now you lie back down.
Cookies!
Just take a deep breath.
What am I doing here?
You passed out for a minute.
That's all. Nothing to worry about.
But how did I get here?
Why don't you let
your friends help you?
Take her into the washroom,
and splash some cold
water on her face,
- and that should perk her up.
- Okay, yes, ma'am.
How are you doing?
Blood drive?
1960?
Want a smoke?
No, Carol, that's the
worst thing for her.
I gave them up years ago.
Where is it?
Where's what?
Maddy, what did you
do to your hair?
We're taking you
back to the nurse.
Yeah, really.
Come on, Peggy Sue.
Ooh, Delores,
why aren't you giving blood?
I can't, I'm too anemic.
Oh, maybe you should drink
some of that nail polish.
It might give you
some strength.
Why don't you come
back and show me how?
We're going to
take you home now.
Oh, that's okay.
I'm sure I can remember the way.
Steady, now.
People get weak
when they give blood.
<i>It's wonderful Spring Radio</i>
<i>at 1280 on your AM dial.</i>
<i>Here's more from
our golden survey.</i>
And now, from The Champs,
let's party with a little Tequila.
I'll call you later!
Yes.
Let's keep in touch.
Who is it?
Peggy.
Peggy Sue.
Come on in.
I left the door open for you.
The nurse called and said
you'd be coming home.
I have a note.
How do you feel?
Uh, I was excused.
Why don't you go upstairs
and lie down for a while.
Oh, Mom.
Mom.
Oh, Chanel No. 5.
That always reminds me of home.
Of course, dear.
You're home now.
You sure you're
going to be all right?
Yeah.
Oh.
What is going on?
Nancy?
It's Nancy.
Oh.
Oh, my baby sister.
Oh.
Oh, honey.
Oh.
Oh, I'm so happy
to see you.
What are you doing?
Mom said you were sick.
You're never
happy to see me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about that.
I want us to be closer.
I have too many unresolved
relationships in my life.
Teenagers are weird,
and you're the weirdest.
Um...
Hey, you want
to play a game?
Come here.
Uh...
How about Monopoly?
Or, uh, Parcheesi?
Or, uh...
Chutes and Ladders?
I have a question for you.
Let me turn the tables on you.
Maybe you down
here don't know.
Is there anybody in the house who
knows where Dion and the Belmonts are?
Yeah!
I don't believe it.
Look at that man. He never ages.
Isn't Kenny Rossi dreamy?
I wish he'd break up
with Arlene, though.
She thinks she's so great.
Oh, don't eat any
of the red ones.
Why not?
They're bad for you.
They give you...
Um, red lips.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh, what the hell?
I'm probably dead anyway.
Peggy Sue, get in here.
Dion's almost over.
I left your laundry on your beds, girls.
Don't forget to put it away.
What's for dinner?
Creamed chipped beef
on toast with rutabagas,
your father's favorite.
Ugh.
Not again.
Evelyn! Girls!
What is this out in the street?
Come and take a look.
Who left this out here?
- What is it, dear?
- Well, come on out and see for yourself.
Wow!
It's cool!
Ta-da!
Wait till I tell Dianne.
She's always bragging
about her dad's Cadillac.
What do you think, Peggy Sue?
Oh, Dad, you were always
doing stuff like this.
It's funny.
It's really funny.
You bought an Edsel.
Young lady,
what's the matter with you?
Are you drunk?
Uh...
Just a little.
I had a tough day.
No, don't wear it out, Nancy.
We can't afford a new car.
We have to take it back.
I fail to see the humor of this.
Go to your room. You're grounded.
I'm grounded?
Put that down.
That's the story of my life.
I'm an adult.
I want to have fun.
I'm going to go to Liverpool
and discover the Beatles.
Jack! Take it easy.
She gave blood at school today.
She's a little lightheaded,
that's all.
This is not giving blood.
This is drunk.
Dad, I never knew you
had a sense of humor.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Come on, Mom!
You're making a mountain out of
a molehill. A tempest in a teapot.
My little baby.
Mmm-hmm.
Now...
Don't try to grow up so fast.
Oh.
Mom, I forgot you
were ever this young.
Oh, sleep, baby.
Oh.
Well, honey, bananas,
strawberries.
Good morning.
What happened to
your hair, Peggy?
You have such a pretty face.
Why are you always
trying to cover it up?
I forgot.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Excuse me, Peggy Sue.
Nancy, put your homework
down and sit down.
You're looking bright and
chipper this morning.
Well, I'm still here.
I thought I might as well enjoy myself.
I think I'll go to
school today.
You know, Dad,
I'm sorry about yesterday.
The Edsel is a classic.
Use it in the best of health.
Well, thank you.
But don't ever let anything
like that happen again.
You're far too young to
start acquiring bad habits.
I agree.
You know, Mom and Dad,
you are the best parents
a girl could ever have.
I'm really going to
try and behave myself.
Sure you will.
Come on, Mom.
Sit down.
You want me to sit?
I mean, isn't this great?
Just all of us
here together.
Oh.
Can I tell Charlie Peggy Sue
got drunk last night?
Young lady.
Hmm!
I forgot about him.
What am I going to do?
What's the matter, Peggy?
Did you two have a fight?
- Sort of.
- About what?
House payments.
Baby!
How do you feel?
Pretty strange.
Well, come on. Get in.
I can take care of that.
I have a headache.
Oh. Headache, huh?
Ah!
You drive like a maniac!
It's not that I'm
glad you were sick,
but it gave me a chance to
do some thinking last night.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you know,
about what we said on Tuesday.
I think it makes
a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget?
We talk about seeing other people,
and you forget.
I must have blocked it out.
Yeah.
I guess I could understand that.
But, please...
Don't start crying again.
It's not going to be forever.
I figure, three years is long enough
for the music to pan out,
which it will.
I know it.
So right after graduation,
we should, one,
start to see other people
so that we can, two,
we can comparison shop.
And then, three,
settle down and get married.
Why wait?
Why not break up now?
Because we got
the prom coming up
and all these parties.
We don't want to
upset our parents.
They'll learn to live with it.
Peggy Sue!
Peggy Sue!
Come here! Come on!
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Psst!
Peggy Sue,
did you study for the test?
Test?
- There's a test?
- Yeah.
All right, class.
Time's up.
And what's the meaning of this,
Peggy Sue?
Well, Mr. Snelgrove,
I happen to know that in the future,
I will not have the slightest
use for algebra.
And I speak from experience.
- Who said that? Sit down.
- I'm sorry.
The result of his struggle is that
Santiago comes back with honor.
Santiago comes
back with nothing.
There's no meat on the bone.
It's Hemingway's ego trying to defend itself
again, trying to prove he can still perform.
What Hemingway's saying,
Michael, is that we are alone,
that when we go out too far,
we're vulnerable.
The irony that Santiago
is beaten by the sharks
doesn't make him
less of a hero.
Who's the victim,
and who's the predator?
We'll finish this
discussion next week.
And don't forget. The first four
chapters of The Great Gatsby by Monday.
Hope you enjoy it.
Why does your father take
inventory on Sunday nights?
- Hi, Peggy.
- It's poker night.
You always got
out of it before.
Well, I just got to string him along
for a little while. It's for his own good.
Yeah, but you're not
going into his business!
I mean, when are
you gonna tell him?
Soon.
Walter!
I can't tell everybody
everything all at once.
Strange rumors are sweeping
the school about you.
Hi, Peggy.
What do you mean?
I hear you really gave
it to old smellygrove.
Oh, I was there.
She told the creep off right to his face.
That-a girl, Peg.
Arthur, don't call me Peg.
Why, I ought to...
I don't get it.
That's because you're not
a total moron like they are.
Stupid movie thing
they just started.
That's enough out of you,
little lady.
Why, I ought to...
I'll be right back.
Hi, Richard.
I wanted to congratulate you
on winning the math contest.
It really wasn't that difficult.
Hey, Peggy, you fishing
for four-eyed worms?
Get lost,
you macho schmuck.
Sheesh!
I wanted to talk to you.
It's really important.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year.
I'm too busy.
No. It's not about that.
Would you meet me
after school, please?
All right.
I'll be in the physics lab.
But, uh...
Can you make it 4:30?
Because I have to go to
a rocket club meeting.
Sure.
She's not wasting any time.
Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root?
He's a nice guy.
He's writing a book.
A book?
Excuse me for a second.
Why is she punishing herself?
Come on, Peggy Sue.
Try it again.
You haven't been practicing.
Sorry.
What a girl, what a twirl.
Peg-leggy Sue Kelcher.
A brief but glorious
career as a majorette.
Ouch!
Baby!
Looking good out there.
Thanks.
I love it when you
twirl your baton.
I noticed you were giving me
the silent treatment at lunch.
I guess I deserved it.
I've been thinking about
my three-year plan.
I think it's totally
unworkable.
I must have been delirious.
Oh, I don't know,
I thought it made some sense.
Well, in the abstract, maybe.
Get a grip on yourself.
But, uh...
When I think about you
going out with other guys,
I feel...
Rejected, worthless, miserable?
Yeah.
Good.
Oh.
Boy, that's some kite.
I'm writing a book
on kite construction.
So, what do you
want to talk about?
I just wanted to
ask you a question.
Do you think time
travel is possible?
Are you doing some
kind of science project?
Sort of.
Well, that's a very
interesting question.
Now, let's see.
If we look at this in
a Newtonian framework,
the possibilities of time
travel were limited.
With the advent of
the relativity theory,
that's Einstein's relativity theory,
the idea of absolute time
cannot be reasonably affirmed.
Well, then we have
Richard's burrito.
What's that?
That's my own theory,
based on a Mexican
food called the burrito.
I had it once when my parents
took me to Disneyland.
I know what a burrito is.
You see, I think that
time is like a burrito
in the sense that one
part of itself will fold over,
and then it will just
touch the other part.
- What's inside?
- You can fill it with whatever you want.
You can fill it with memories,
with experiences, trigonometry.
Anything.
Then you think that time travel
is possible for people?
Yes, it is.
It is possible.
It's absolutely possible
for people, for dogs,
for elephants, for cancan girls.
Oh!
Then I'm not crazy!
I really don't know
if you're crazy.
I know most people think I am.
Come here, Richard.
- Come on.
- What are you doing?
Wait a minute!
What are you...
Now, I want to
tell you something,
only you have to promise
not to tell anyone else.
Okay.
I'm serious.
No one else can know.
I promise I'm not
going to tell anybody.
I have come here
from the future,
from 25 years ahead.
I think that you're
probably crazy.
Uh... I really...
You know, I really don't have time
for this. I don't have time for jokes.
Because I know what you
people think about me.
No!
No!
- I really don't appreciate...
- Listen.
You're just the smartest
guy I knew to ask.
I know it sounds unbelievable,
but I can prove it.
Well, proof is an
excellent concept.
How?
You have a blind grandfather.
You're going to invent this machine
that reads books for the blind.
You're gonna invent a lot of things.
You're gonna be really famous.
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
How did you know
about my grandfather?
Because I'm telling the truth.
I read about your
invention in a magazine.
I know a lot of things that
are going to happen.
There's gonna be test tube
babies and heart transplants.
An American named
Neil Armstrong
is going to be the first man
to walk on the moon,
July 20, 1969.
1969?
That's 6 years
ahead of schedule.
I would be very careful
about this if I were you.
What if you fall into the
hands of some madman
with plans to manipulate
your brain?
Well, that's why I
was getting a divorce.
You know what I really
think happened?
I think that I had a heart attack
at the reunion and I died.
You look great for a corpse.
- I'm serious.
- You're giving me the creeps here.
Well, am I dead or not?
There's one way to find out.
- Here, give me this.
- What are you doing?
Confucius say, "If you want a way out,
you go through a door. "
Okay.
There's a fire truck.
If you're dead,
it will pass right through you.
Okay, now just stay there.
You're dead.
- Hey, lady!
- No! I don't want to die!
It's all right, it's all right.
- Are you all right? Okay, okay.
- Yeah.
I had it made into a
cocktail ring though.
This is good.
Well, there's not
a whole heck of a lot here.
- Very nice pieces.
- So... Thank you.
Well, I'll take them
to the shop
and have the appraisal ready next week.
Good day, Mrs. Kelcher.
Goodbye.
Who was that man?
That was nobody, Peggy.
I'm voting for the
democrats this year.
You know how your father
feels about democrats?
That was a polltaker.
I wouldn't mention
it if I were you.
How was school today, darling?
Oh, well, it was nice to
see everybody again.
I don't know, everything
they teach is so useless.
And the lunch!
God, that was the worst.
Get that, Peggy.
- Hello.
- Peggy Sue? This is Grandma.
- Grandma?
- How's my little girI?
What's the matter, Peggy?
- Peggy, what's wrong?
- It's Grandma.
I can't talk.
I'm sorry.
Mom, I'll call you
back in a minute.
It's Peggy.
It's okay.
I'll call you back.
Peggy Sue, what is it?
What happened to you just now?
What is this all about?
I dreamed that Grandma died.
Oh, baby.
No wonder you're so upset.
She's getting on, it's true,
but she's fine.
I told her you weren't
feeling well yesterday.
She called to find
out how you are.
I love her so much,
and I haven't seen
her in so long.
Grandpa Barney,
is he all right?
He's perfectly fine.
You saw them at Easter.
What's this all about, Peggy?
I don't know.
I forgot.
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'll apologize.
Good girl.
I hate to see you so upset.
You're my angel.
Peggy, I don't mean
to be intrusive,
but are you having
problems with Charlie?
You mentioned something
this morning.
A lot of things are
confusing right now.
Charlie's just one of them.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things
you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Peggy, you know
what a penis is.
Stay away from it.
Whoa!
You're the best.
Make her love me, okay?
Feed me, charge me.
Go get her, tiger.
Get the door, Jack!
Just a moment.
Oh, hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Mr. Kelcher.
- Come on in.
How are things at
the hat store?
Very good.
Charlie, could I have
a word with you?
- Is something wrong, sir? - No.
Not a thing. I'd just like to talk to you.
- Charles!
- Hi, Mrs. Kelcher.
You look wonderful.
Snap, crackle, pop.
Oh, they're delicious.
Sit down, Charlie.
Nancy!
That sounded really great, Nancy.
Charlie, you may
have noticed that
Peggy Sue has been acting
a little bit strange lately.
- Indeed.
- She's distorted.
Nancy, please.
She seems to be a little
bit nervous and confused.
Uh-huh.
Overemotional,
and even a bit
irresponsible at times.
Uh-huh.
Of course, her mother says
that's the way girls act sometimes.
She's almost a
juvenile delinquent.
- No.
- Out!
Why, I ought to...
Oh, God.
Yes, sir, but I think that's what
I like about Peggy, Mr. Kelcher.
She's not like all the
other girls at school.
Charlie, in spite of your adolescent
infatuation with music,
we've always regarded you
as a very fine young man.
Oh, thank you, sir.
And we've trusted you
with our daughter.
Well, trust is a
two-way street.
In the past two years,
I've been pleased to note
that you and Mrs. Kelcher have
provided your sacred trust
with upbringing the woman that
I plan to take off your hands.
Charlie's downstairs.
Why aren't you ready?
For what?
For Maddy's party,
that's for what.
Mom, I don't feel like
going to a party.
Feel or not feel,
you accepted this invitation,
Maddy's one of
your best friends,
I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
You're supposed to be
doing your homework.
I have to talk to your sister.
Baby,
try and enjoy yourself.
This is the best time
of your whole life.
The sooner you learn to
handle Charlie, the better.
Stand up to Charlie.
Be a good girl.
Wear something cheerful...
Perky.
We think this party
might cheer her up,
as long as you understand
what's expected of you.
What would that be?
Show her a good time,
but for heaven's sake, restrain yourself!
Of course.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Charlie?
Your sweater!
It's great, isn't it?
Wow! It's really '50s.
It's like you clash
with the whole world.
Hey, what's the fun of being a
teenager if you can't dress weird?
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.
- Good night, Mom.
- Be good, dear.
Good night,
Mr. And Mrs. Kelcher.
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Have a good time, youngsters!
Nancy!
Oh.
You look really beautiful.
Thank you.
I cleaned the car.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
It looks better at night.
I got tickets for Fabian on your birthday.
You like him, right?
Yeah, he's cool.
Well, I was thinking of four
ushers and four bridesmaids.
See, the Yankees got pitching,
but the White Sox
got the defense.
What are your
colors going to be?
Take Kubek and Richardson
any day over Fox and Aparicio.
Guess I'm thinking
of pink and green.
Carol, Carol!
- Look at Delores! What a tramp!
- Oh, my God!
I think that pitching
wins pennants.
The Tigers have got four
20-game potential winners.
You'd be surprised at how many
girls in school aren't virgins.
- Like who?
- Like who?
Don Mossi, Frank Lary,
Jim Bunning,
and Paul Foytack.
- Hello.
- Hello!
Hello!
And now... Direct from four weeks
of rehearsal in Walter's garage,
four guys who have
prided themselves
on becoming the greatest
singing group in the world,
Walter, Leon, Terry,
and Charlie,
The Definitions!
Shh!
Shh!
<i>Don't - know - why - I
love you like I do</i>
<i>Don't - know - why - I do</i>
<i>Don't know why I love you</i>
<i>Don't know why I care</i>
<i>I just want
your love to share</i>
<i>I wonder why I</i>
<i>love you like I do</i>
Charlie can really sing!
Yeah, maybe they'll be the
next Dion and the Belmonts.
I wouldn't count on it.
Oh, come on,
where's your enthusiasm?
<i>...like I do</i>
<i>I told my friends,
that we would never part</i>
<i>They often said;
That you would break my heart</i>
- Oh, he really is kind of cute,
isn't he? - Oh, yeah!
...think that we will part
He really loves you, too.
You're so lucky.
He's always telling Walter
how wonderful you are.
- He is?
- Yeah.
Carol and I saw you with that
creep Richard Norvik today.
First of all,
he's not a creep.
He's an exceptional person.
You'd know that if you took any time.
You're just taking pity on him
because he has no friends.
You know, if you weren't
so neurotic and insecure,
maybe you could shut up for a while
and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
I don't know what you just said
to her, but I wish I'd said it.
Hi, fellas.
Oh, Walter!
What do you think
about Richard Norvik?
He's a nice guy.
Is he going to help you
with all that physics stuff?
He's trying.
Hey, who needs physics
when we've got chemistry?
Hey, put on some make-out music,
and turn out the lights.
Good idea.
There's not a girl in school
that can hold a candle to you.
You're pretty charming
when you want to be.
Yeah.
I know.
But I don't have
to flatter you.
It just feels right.
You're the perfect girl for me,
as in, is,
was,
and always will be.
I'm glad dancing was invented.
You know,
the first dances were rituals,
like fertility rites.
I always loved the
way you kissed.
Oh, I missed you.
Your eyes
look like silver pools
of moonlight,
and the tide rushes in.
Oh...
You really love me,
don't you?
You know I do.
I even wrote you into my will.
Oh, Charlie...
Let's make love.
What?
You mean sex?
Intercourse.
You want to have intercourse?
Last weekend, you said...
What time is it?
Holy cow! It's late.
A lot of things have happened
since last weekend.
But you were the one
who said we should wait
and you were right.
We should wait until we get married.
Well, I know I must have
believed that when I said it,
- but doesn't Lucky Chucky
want to come out? - Who?
You know,
your love machine,
your throbbing thrillhammer,
your thing.
You mean my wang?
Listen, it's running real late!
Come on!
What is this?
What the hell is going on,
Peggy Sue?
One week, you say
"If you love me, you won't. "
The next week you say,
"If you love me, you will. "
That's a guy's line!
Forget about it.
I made a mistake.
You're damn right.
Jesus, Peggy.
You sure know how
to spoil a mood.
I'm sorry.
Save it, woman!
Humiliator!
I was very impressed with what
you said in English class today.
Gilfond's okay, except that he thinks
Hemingway's great literature.
And you don't?
He's a fisherman.
The most overrated
writer of the century.
Man, he is the perfect
American author.
Fat, violent, drunk.
Maybe you're confusing
his life with his work.
A writer's life is his work.
Jack Kerouac doesn't
have to kill a bull
to have something
to write about.
I mean, man, he's out there
burning, feeling, grooving on life!
The young man leaned
back in his chair.
No bulls would die today.
What are you doing here, anyway?
Coffee, donuts.
I thought chicks like
you traveled in packs.
Hey, man.
I'm a hip chick.
- Come on, Delores.
- Terry, slow down.
Why?
Look, there's Peggy Sue
with Michael Fitzsimmons!
Oh, that commie beatnik?
Yeah. First a geek,
and now a weirdo.
Yeah.
Woo!
Woo!
- This is great!
- Yeah.
This is great reefer.
Mmm-hmm!
It must belong to Beth.
I found it in my dress.
It's really old.
Travels well.
Boy, the world sure
looks better up here.
The world is fantastic.
It's the ultimate absurd circus,
and I am shot from a
cannon into the energy.
What are you shooting for?
Maximum intensity.
Yeah! I'm gonna get out of here.
I'm going to write.
I'm going to check out
of this bourgeois motel,
push myself away
from the dinner table,
and say,
"No more Jell-O for me, Mom!"
Don't you get along
with your parents?
Well...
All my father digs is money.
All my mother cares about is her
standing at the country club.
Oh, come on.
They care about you.
They're just a different generation.
Hey, what's with you?
I thought you were cool.
You rode my bike,
you blew some pot.
Hey, what's your scene,
Miss majorette?
You going to marry
Mr. Blue Impala
and graze around with the other
sheep for the rest of your life?
No. I already did that.
I want to be a dancer.
That's what I want to do!
I'm going to dance
and dance.
And dance.
Come here.
You know,
I had you pegged all wrong.
A ray of oneness
piercing the solitude.
Falling bodies in
the ecstasy of flesh.
Oh! Is that one of your poems?
No.
I just made that up.
- Oh.
- Do you want to hear one?
Yeah!
It's called Tenderness.
I couldn't sleep,
so I thought I'd scream.
Betrayed by a kiss,
sucking pods of bitterness
in the madhouse of Dr. Dread!
Razor shreds of rat
puke fall on my bare arms!
I'm sorry.
I was trying to impress you.
Michael,
you're as good
as you looked.
How many loved your
moments of glad grace,
and loved your beauty
with love false or true.
But one man loved
the pilgrim soul in you,
and loved the sorrows
of your changing face.
I didn't write that.
That's Yeats.
I envy you.
You have your whole
life ahead of you,
and you know exactly
what you want.
But no more rat puke, okay?
Try and write
something beautiful.
I'll respect you for eternity.
Oh, Michael.
You know,
this really isn't happening.
That's one Shostakovich.
Shostakovich?
Charlie, I'm just taking the Ravel.
Listen, take the
Shostakovich home.
Listen to it.
Let it grow on you.
If you don't like it,
I will give you your money back.
Well, I did like the Dvorak one
you suggested. I liked it a lot.
Young man,
you talked me into it.
It was definitive Dvorak.
You'll like it.
I kid you not.
Ahhh!
What do you know
about classical music?
Nothing.
Selling is selling.
Charlie, about last night...
Hush. Hush, baby.
Hush.
I've been thinking.
Girls must go through
that stuff, too.
Sometimes when I look at you,
I feel like an animal!
I don't know.
Maybe my dad's right.
Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not.
I'm a grown woman
with a lifetime of experiences
you can't understand.
Yeah. Girls mature
faster than guys.
But last night, I was the one
who put on the brakes.
And you know why?
Why?
Because nothing else matters.
That's the great
thing about love.
Every time we argue,
every time something
goes wrong...
And I know I'm
not perfect, either.
Things just work out
better in the end
because you're my baby,
and I love you.
Charlie,
what am I going
to do with you?
Oh, boy.
Just cherish me.
You have an unparalelled
opportunity
to become the richest
woman in the world.
and I'm gonna be your partner.
I'll tell you where there's a real
fortune to be made, running shoes.
Tennis shoes, jogging shoes.
All that kind of stuff.
I mean, I'm talking $50,
$100, $200 a pair.
- Wait, you gotta be kidding me.
- No!
You're talking about exercise stuff,
like gym stuff?
Not your style, huh?
These are the choices, okay?
Microwave ovens.
Pocket calculators.
Walk-a-mans.
Digital watches.
And miniature television sets.
Oh, and huge radios.
I mean, for some reason,
everything else gets tiny,
but portable radios
get enormous.
Huge, enormous radios.
- Portable enormous radios.
- Wait a minute.
I got an idea.
Come on! Come on!
Come here.
Here.
Okay.
Excuse me, Miss,
do you have pantyhose?
I'm sorry.
What?
Pantyhose.
You know.
Pantyhose?
Why, Richard!
This is lingerie!
Oh! Mrs. Woodhouse.
Uh, I'm studying the fabric
for the aerodynamic principles,
uh, for kites.
They don't have it! They've never even
heard of it. Isn't that wonderful?
Wait, what are
you talking about?
I'm talking about the
wave of the future.
- I've decided on our first fortune.
- Shh!
Okay, I'll see you later.
- Okay.
- You just keep thinking high tech.
Okay?
High tech?
Ooh, that's nice.
I like the sound of that.
High tech.
Yeah?
- All right, what is the scoop?
- What?
How come we're
your best friends,
and we had to find out about you and
Michael Fitzsimmons from Delores.
Wow. Who needs satellites
when I got Delores' mouth?
I hear she does more than
talk with her mouth.
That's disgusting!
Oh, Maddy,
would you grow up?
It says right in
Love Without Fear
that the tongue kiss as a means of genital
stimulation is widely practiced
and has much to commend it!
Did you memorize that whole
book or just the good parts?
No.
Just what you underlined.
You did!
You know, Carol,
you have great hair.
Peggy Sue, come on!
What's with you and Michael?
Yeah, come on.
He's so cool and mysterious.
Well, he's interesting.
Underneath that
rough exterior
lurks the heart
of a true poet.
A poet?
I bet Delores told Charlie.
- Oh, that loud-mouthed little bitch!
- Hey, Peggy Sue!
You better watch out for her, Peggy Sue.
She's after Charlie.
Just cool it, girls, huh?
Charlie is free to go out with
whoever he wants to.
What?
But I always thought you
were gonna marry Charlie,
and that Carol would marry Walter,
and I'd marry Arthur.
We'd all live on
the same street
and take our kids to
the park together
and have barbecues
every Sunday.
It's gonna spoil everything
if you and Charlie break up.
That Michael Fitzsimmons doesn't
look like the barbecue type!
Oh, come on!
I just had one date with him.
I'm not gonna marry him!
You promise?
Come on.
Let's go to the movies.
Oh, Peggy Sue,
I mean, don't be silly.
It's Saturday night.
It's date night!
Yeah. I got to go.
Arthur's picking me up soon.
Oh, no, wait a minute, I mean something
just the girls, like a slumber party, huh?
Aren't we a little old
for that, Peggy Sue?
Sometimes you're so immature.
Bye.
I'm immature.
Charlie?
Charlie, I had such a dream.
Peggy Sue,
I have to talk to you.
Charlie, what are
you doing here?
Let's go down to the basement.
Okay.
I want to know
what's going on.
Delores told me about you and
that scuzball, Michael Fitzsimmons.
When you dropped me off last night,
I just didn't feel like going to bed
and I ran into Michael.
We went for a ride.
Then it's true, damn it!
I had a miserable time
tonight because of you.
When the Monotones did
Book of Love, chapter four...
<i>You break up</i>
<i>Won't you give it
one more chance?</i>
I'm thinking,
did we break up?
Did we break up?
Cause if we did,
I don't even know about it.
Did that Maynard, Maynard G. Beatnik,
give you what you wanted?
You know,
I hate your sarcasm.
You're going to blow it,
Peggy Sue.
No one treats
Charlie Bodell like this.
Why do you have to talk
about yourself in the third person
like you were Napoleon?
Why does everything have
to be an argument with you?
Look, I've got the hair.
I've got the teeth.
I've got the eyes.
Well, Peggy, look outside that window.
I've got the car.
I'm the lead singer.
I'm the man.
Why are you arguing with me?
It's over, Charlie.
I don't want to hurt you.
I want you to be happy!
But, no, I will be
happy if I have you.
I love you.
No! That doesn't make
any difference!
We just can't live together.
And you went off with
that bimbo Janet!
What are you talking about? Who is Janet?
I don't know any Janet.
I just can't trust you.
But what about everything
I said to you this afternoon?
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
It's like I have this window in my heart.
And any time you feel like it, you can just
crawl right in. Well, I got to close it,
or nothing's ever
going to be different!
What has to be different?
Everything! You know it's
not gonna work like this.
You have to go to
college and finish!
What about the group
and my singing career?
What about me?
I am trying to save
you years of frustration,
of waiting for that...
That big break.
No, that big disappointment
so you can blame me
for the rest of your life!
You don't know zip.
You think I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life
selling appliances,
chasing women around the store
like my father?
I've got to give it a shot!
What the hell has changed,
Peggy Sue?
Until yesterday, you loved me,
and you loved us.
For two years,
I've done nothing but love you.
Fine. I'll prove it to you.
I'll show you.
I'm going to be
just like Fabian.
Let's sit there.
Sure.
This is great.
Yeah.
Okay, here we go.
Suds for you.
Thank you.
And whiskey for you.
Five more weeks of school.
Ten minutes past graduation,
I'm gone.
To freedom!
For everyone.
Now this is the plan.
As soon as school is finished,
we move to Utah.
Utah?
I thought you'd be going
to Paris or New York.
I mean, what's in Utah?
Rita.
I met her last summer.
She's cool.
You'll really dig her.
She's got this great little cabin
just outside the hills of Provo
where she raises chickens.
I'll write. And you two can take
care of the chickens to support us.
I can't do that.
Why not?
Polygamy's legal in Utah.
I'm allergic to chickens.
I'd like to introduce
Mr. Charlie Bell.
Oh.
Well, wait.
What about the other night?
We were like two stars
in the same constellation.
Michael, you and I
are light-years apart.
You should go,
but not with me.
But we had heat, baby.
Passion!
Fire!
We owe it to ourselves
to fuse together
at least one more time.
Oh. That's a great line.
You are going to be a terrific writer.
You think so?
Yeah.
Michael,
we had one glorious
night together.
Someday you'll remember
and write about it.
Yeah.
I can dig that.
Bittersweet perfection.
Dogs of lust on
leashes of memory.
Yes!
It's Charlie!
What a treat.
- Now I get it.
- Shh! It's great.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on
treble without a cause.
I thought I knew
everything about him.
Yeah.
Can we split now?
Thank you.
Yeah!
So, Mr. Wilkins, new client?
Uh, I'm sorry, Charlie.
Um, it...
I don't think so, you know?
It happens, but not with you.
It's, uh...
Believe me when I tell you.
Maybe it's the material,
but it can't happen.
Good morning.
Charlie...
What are you doing here?
I wanted to talk to you.
I got one last thing I have
to do at school, and then...
Hey.
Hey, Elvis.
Hi! How are you?
Hi, guy.
Elvis is dead.
That's Ajax.
Oh.
I guess I always liked Elvis.
- Can I have a ride to school?
- No.
Why?
Blue Tiger's out of
commission for a while.
How about a walk, Charlie Bell?
How do you know about that?
I was at Lena's last night.
I heard you sing
I thought you were terrific.
Not terrific enough. What were you
doing there? Who were you with?
Well, what were you doing there? You
never told me you sang with an R&B group.
Well, there's not a whole heck of a lot
we know about each other, Peggy.
I forgot how much
music meant to you.
Ha!
That's real big of you.
Stop being so defensive.
Here.
I wrote a song for you.
Why did you write me a song?
Because I want to help you.
And it'll be a hit, I promise.
Oh, come on!
Stop being sarcastic.
Lee Wilkins came to
hear me last night.
He told me to forget it.
Would you just
take a look at it?
Come on.
I wrote it for you.
Well, if you wrote it,
I guess I'll look at it.
Listen, about the other night,
I feel so stupid.
I'm beginning to think that
maybe there is more to life
than just music.
Do you think the world
would still like me
if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Yeah.
Do you want to walk to school?
- Okay. I'll just put the dog inside.
- Okay.
Come on, Ajax.
What's the matter, princess?
Lost your prince?
You know, Delores,
there are a lot of things
I could say to you,
but you're just not
worth the effort.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
These pens are so tricky.
You did that on purpose!
I hate you!
Go stuff your bra.
I beg your pardon?
Take a long walk
on a short pier.
Have a nice day.
You know, Peggy, there are so many
things to look forward to in the future.
I came to say goodbye, Richard.
Goodbye?
Wait a minute.
Sit down.
Goodbye?
Where are you going?
Peggy, we have a partnership, here.
I'm making real progress
on that microchip.
Well, you were meant to.
You're just one of the fortunate
people good things happen to.
So are you.
You have a vision, Peggy.
A vision?
I am a walking anachronism.
I've upset my parents.
I miss my kids.
I could be trapped here forever.
And poor Charlie.
I got pregnant
when I was 18.
That was why we
had to get married.
Tomorrow's my birthday.
I have to get out of here.
You broke up with Charlie?
Yeah.
I know it's a gamble.
I've loved him for a long,
long time.
Okay, then let's do
something really visionary.
Change your destiny, Peggy Sue.
Change your destiny
and marry me.
No.
No, no!
Peggy Sue got married.
Case closed.
I don't want to
marry anyone, Richard.
Goodbye.
Wait. Peggy, please,
can I go with you?
No.
You have to be valedictorian.
Peggy Sue!
Wait a minute.
Listen, I cut shop and I did
some work on your song.
You know, it's not half
bad for your first try.
Of course, I changed all the yeahs
to oohs, but listen to this.
She loves you,
ooh, ooh, ooh
You love me,
ooh, ooh, ooh
I got to go.
About your birthday...
I made reservations
at Chez Treve.
I thought it'd be great to
eat at a nice restaurant.
I won't be here.
Why?
I want to go see
my grandparents.
Goodbye, Charlie.
I canceled the
tickets for Fabian.
Let me close that.
- There you are.
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, look!
Oh, it's so beautiful!
What's the matter, Peggy?
Did someone jump on your grave?
It's nice over here.
You know, Peggy, your mother
said you had a dream that I'd died.
I wish she hadn't
told you that.
I'm not afraid.
I know exactly when I'm going to die.
What's it going to be,
Lizzie, 75 or 80?
I'm not telling!
I've been trying to drag
that out of her for years.
You know, dreams are
fascinating business,
especially when
you see the future.
Do you believe all this?
Well, I like to speculate.
Like this book I'm
reading right now.
It's about a woman in Colorado
who says she lived in
Ireland 150 years ago.
She gives names, dates,
and where she lived.
Grandma, Grandpa,
I want to tell you something.
If you believe it, darling,
then I believe.
Being young is just as
confusing as being old.
The things that happened
to me 50 years ago
are more on my mind than the
things that happened today.
But I'm remembering
the future.
Chilling wind tonight.
It's really picking up.
Right now, you're just
browsing through time.
Choose the things
you'll be proud of.
Things that last.
I'm proud of my children.
I miss them so much.
Beth...
Scott and Beth.
I named my daughter after you.
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Oh.
Grandpa.
You know, when you and Grandma
are gone, the family's gone.
I don't ever see
the cousins anymore.
It's your grandma's strudel that's
kept this family together.
If you could do it
all again, Grandpa,
what would you do different?
I'd have taken better
care of my teeth.
Oh.
Now, what's Peggy Sue going
to do at your lodge meeting?
It's her 18th birthday and
I want to show her off.
It was my idea, Grandma.
I always wondered what went
on at those lodge meetings.
He won't tell me, but I have my
suspicions and I don't want to know.
Have a good time, darling.
- Thank you. Night, darling.
- Goodbye.
Grandpa?
What does Grandma think
you do at these meetings?
Stag movies and poker.
I may be an old fool,
but I think I can help you.
Well, at least I got to see
you and Grandma again.
Has this ever worked before?
The last time was
600 years ago.
And it's about time
for another one.
Look at this!
Gramps brought a
beautiful young lady!
Oh, my goodness!
Welcome, Peggy Sue.
Peggy Sue.
Welcome, Peggy Sue!
It's so wonderful to
have you here with us.
- Thank you very much.
- You've come to the right place.
Our lodge was founded
by a time traveler.
- We're gonna send you back home.
- That's right. That's right.
You know, this is very
exciting for all of us.
You know, we've waited
a very long, long time
to find a girl like you.
Yes.
Grandpa.
Do you have to
wear that hat?
Wouldn't be a
lodge without hats.
Lord of the universe,
vast and mighty one,
ruler of light,
king of the sun,
this girl is lost amid
your mysteries
and wishes to return
to her own time.
We adore thee
and invoke thee.
Grant thy...
Look with favor upon us
as we witness the
regeneration of spirit.
We ask thy intervention
that this girl may
return to thee
on the wings of thy love.
O spirit, reclaim
thy child of light.
The name of your
love is rebirth.
This is never going to work.
It's gonna work.
Reclaim thy child of light.
We offer up this girl
that her soul may
find its home.
Nothing to worry about.
Somebody get the lights.
Somebody get the lights!
She's gone!
What the hell do you
think you're doing?
I'm saving you!
They were going
to vaporize you!
...completely ridiculous.
They're a bunch of harmless old men!
My grandfather was in there!
- Get in the car!
- I'm not getting in, you monstrosity!
Well, the girl's gone.
Let's play cards.
Let me go!
Well, I got good news.
Now, sit down right there.
You've got two minutes!
I told my father that
I'm going to quit singing,
and he gave me 10%
of the business right now!
What are you talking about?
I know what you've
been going through.
But you were just scared.
But you don't have to be scared anymore.
I can support you now.
- Aw, sh...
- Peggy Sue,
will you marry me?
How can you know what
I've been going through?
Of course I'm scared!
I can't change anything!
I can't help anybody!
You're not listening to me.
I'm proposing to you now.
You betrayed me. You were never
there for me and the children!
I'll be there for the children.
I'll forget Walter!
Forget the group!
I want to marry you!
Don't be crazy.
I may be crazy, but I'm not crazy
enough to marry you twice.
Oh, Christ.
Peggy.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was what
you wanted me to be.
It's all my fault.
Here.
It's a birthday present.
I'm tired of being
the romantic fool.
I'm going to go sit in my car.
Oh.
Charlie?
It opens, too.
Look inside.
Scott and Beth.
Where did you get this?
Who are Scott and Beth?
Your mother gave me those.
It's you and me.
You know that.
So are they.
Oh, Charlie!
Oh, I do love you!
I love you.
This is right, Peggy Sue.
I want this to be forever.
Forever.
Mom, can you hear me?
Please, Mom,
can you hear me?
I call what happened
to you a near-death.
But we figured out
what the problem is.
You are a very
lucky young lady.
I'll give you some medicine.
And you're going to be okay.
What happened to you,
Peggy Sue,
was a very rare problem
with the rhythm of your heart.
Mom, do you
remember anything?
So many people were praying.
They had to do CPR on you
before the paramedics arrived to
give your heart a shock and restart it.
Dad's been here every day.
<i>Because I love you,
Peggy Sue</i>
<i>I love you, Peggy Sue</i>
<i>I love you, girl</i>
<i>And I need you</i>
<i>Peggy</i>
Peggy.
Charlie.
Was I dead?
I thought you
were for a while.
You look awful.
You look like you
haven't slept in days.
You look so old.
But happy.
Very happy, Peggy.
I thought I knew
everything about you.
- I'm sorry.
- I wanted to tell you that I...
I wanted to apol...
I can't live...
without you.
What about Janet?
That's over.
I got tired of translating
everything to her.
She thought the Big Bopper
was a hamburger.
Who are all the
flowers from?
Everyone.
Maddy and... Arthur,
and Carol and Walter,
and Richard Norvik.
And here's a book
by that guy in high school,
Michael Fitzsimmons.
He dedicated it to you.
It couldn't be me.
I hardly knew him.
Well, I'll just set
this right here.
Charlie,
I had a strange experience.
I went back to high school,
and I spent a lot
of time with you.
You and Walter and Leon
were singing I Wonder Why.
Oh, God!
Dion.
You were terrific.
And I kept trying
to push you away.
But you wouldn't give up.
I'll never give up.
Would you hold me?
Oh, Peggy.
I don't expect that all our
problems can just vanish.
But...
Oh, Christ.
I would cut my right arm off
- for another chance.
- No, please.
I need some time.
Well, I'll let you
get some rest.
Charlie, uh...
I'd like to invite you over
to your house for dinner
on Sunday with your kids.
I'll make a strudel.
