Porphyria:
Excess of porphyrins in the blood.
Subject may become
egocentric, irritable or aggressive.
May lead to acts of violence.
Your young man?
This is Grandma Margot.
My mom.
You're very pretty, Joseph. Very charming.
My compliments.
How's Dad?
Your father's fine.
He adores Spain.
I wouldn't say Spain is perfect. I'm more...
What's the word?
- Circumspect?
- Yes, "circumspect. "
I'm forgetting my French.
Oh, I've made a stain.
- Where?
- There.
No, there's no stain.
These suburbs are so ugly!
Why hide out here in the suburbs?
In the outer suburbs.
Vaucresson's almost the country.
- If I were famous...
- That's why I hide out here.
The Marriage Knot
- I started it.
- About time!
It's not easy to find in Malaga.
Even a bestseller.
If you'd sent us a copy...
Maybe I was scared you'd not like it.
Dad would've pretended to read it,
but I think it's excellent.
The start, superb!
You were rough on New York.
And on poor Edouard.
You do lay into him!
Does he look like him?
He's giving me a look.
Yes. He must be wondering
why you talk all the time.
Joseph's story
Remember, you'd say to your father:
"Here we go!
She's giving us her glazed look! Help!"
How do I look now?
The poor Spanish doctors say I'm fine now,
but that a break in Paris
couldn't do any harm.
Yeah, sure! What hicks!
They're just not able to run such tests.
- When do you start?
- Tomorrow at 9:00.
But how will I get to Porte Champerret
by 9:00?
I won't take these suburban lines!
You can loan me the car.
You won't be able to look after me.
This kid won't stand it.
I can find a nanny. It's not that hard.
You don't have one?
I've only been back in France for 3 weeks.
- Unbelievable!
- Maybe...
but you'll see, I do have a pretty house.
What do you think?
Nothing too fancy, then?
No. Just a house.
- Not like New York.
- That's the idea.
I wanted a normal place
where I could live with Joseph.
No dinner parties every night
or cocktail parties.
No Edouard...
- No accursed poet.
- Exactly.
You have to bring him up!
Calm down, will you?
Stop clowning around. Silly boy!
You don't want kids, then you love them.
Yes, but I wanted him.
Yes, sorry.
No mirror here?
Yes, there is. In here.
- Edouard didn't want kids.
- Yes, OK.
I never understood women
who want to become mothers.
I know.
You don't have a TV?
I was so looking forward to French TV!
Why no TV?
It's not that bad, is it?
I'm lost without TV!
Oh, hello.
Yes, of course she's here.
We were going to phone you.
Want to say hi to your grandson?
Your grandson, you know?
Joseph the American.
Grandpa says hello.
OK, I'll put her on.
Well, how are you doing?
Oh, not even a two-hour flight.
What? Well, the house is OK,
but I've seen better.
The tests tomorrow.
Yes, same to you, same to you.
He's worried sick!
Ah, time for a nap.
Yes, beddy-byes.
I'll take you both out for a meal tonight!
Know any good restaurants?
No. This little fellow has a set pattern:
afternoon nap, and bedtime at 8:00.
Let's go, just us two.
Phone some home-help service.
You'll have a girl here in no time.
I'd love to eat out with you.
If I abandon him, he'll hold it against you.
Don't make an enemy.
The window's on the catch
'cause it's hot, isn't it?
- Aren't you hot?
- I am.
I'll leave the night-light on.
You have a rest.
Be quiet. Don't behave like your grandma.
I'll leave this door open
and shut the other.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're brooding, Brigitte.
You've got your back to me.
Only because
I'm washing the saucers, Mom.
Thinking I was a bad mother, aren't you?
That I wasn't a "proper mom"?
Sometimes I think that, yes.
Making up for it with your son.
But you're right, I was a terrible mother.
Awful.
But I was sick. Sick!
Long before you and Dad realized that.
I was a suffering soul, Brigitte.
A lost soul... I'd gone astray.
You don't like your name.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.
It's your name.
It's the name Dad and I chose for you.
We so loved Brigitte Bardot.
We just adored that name!
You're too hard. Too rigid.
Stiff. You're stiff.
You were so scared of me!
So scared of me.
Weren't you, my love?
What a childhood I gave you!
All that anxiety. All that fear.
I'd give anything to let you forget.
It's hot in here.
I'm running a temperature. Feel.
On fire, aren't I?
A little.
I'll get some air, then.
I'll go in the garden.
I haven't seen it yet.
- How are his reflexes?
- All normal.
- When did it happen?
- Around 6 PM.
Was he already unconscious?
I don't know. Probably.
- Didn't you find him?
- No, my mother did.
The lady who came with you wants you.
Well, what's going on?
I don't understand it.
They say his spinal column
and head are OK,
but they don't know
when he'll come out of the coma.
Well, there's no sense in you staying.
I'll tell you which key is which.
You can get a taxi home.
- What's wrong?
- You're staying here?
Well, of course I am.
I can't stay in a strange house alone.
Your father never leaves me alone.
You take a taxi and go home.
Your son's in a coma! What does he care?
He won't realize a thing.
Your father wouldn't have let me come
if he'd known.
I'll get sick...
I'm staying tonight if you like it or not!
- Either go home or come with me...
- No!
So, keep your ass on that chair till I say!
What about my tests tomorrow?
As soon as you get home, call me.
- You do have my mobile number?
- Yes!
Well?
Too soon to say.
We'll have to wait,
but your little boy seems pretty tough.
Is the coma normal?
In certain cases of cerebral bruising, yes.
I'll come back tomorrow morning
around 8:00. Good night.
- Valerie, are you coming?
- Yes.
Things are tense. It's been a long day.
This is no time to say this,
but I really liked your book.
I lived in New York for a while.
It brought it all back.
- The sensations...
- Thank you.
Look, I'm sorry.
We can talk about books...
No, I shouldn't have... I'm sorry.
Don't worry. Everything will be OK.
Is everything OK?
What time is it, please?
12:30 AM.
She didn't phone...?
Who?
No, ma'am, it's not allowed in here.
It disrupts the electronics.
Thanks. I'll pay you back.
102 Fahrenheit.
- That's high.
- He's running a fever.
Where the hell has she gone to?
You left her alone? Anything could happen!
Look, if she calls, leave me a message.
Damn, not on the cell phone!
Excuse me, what's the number here, please?
Wait, I know. Call Clemence.
Maybe she went to see her.
- Clemence who?
- Favereaux. An old friend.
Brigitte? Is that you? Well, I never!
Have you heard from my mom recently?
No, we haven't.
Why? Is she in Paris?
Yes, since yesterday.
Thanks, Mrs. Favereaux.
Excuse me. Goodbye.
Adrenaline ready?
Of course I heard the phone!
I didn't think it was you.
You were far too busy with him
to worry about me.
If you're interested, I had my tests.
And I'm very disappointed.
What news?
Not much. They examined me.
I go back Thursday.
You're not interested...
Sorry about last night. I wasn't well.
You sensed it, didn't you?
I feel so bad in hospitals.
They smell of sickness, death...
This morning, I feel just fine!
A good night's sleep
and I feel great!
Mrs. Fisher...
We're so sorry.
Your little boy just had a cerebral edema.
We did all we could to save him.
What are you doing, Jose? Come here.
It's nothing. C'mon.
Mind your wrist.
Does it still hurt?
Jose's story
Where's Mom?
There.
Well, what's up?
No kiss?
What did the hospital say?
It's OK. But he hurt his wrist.
Any fool can see that!
We'll look after you tonight, kid.
You didn't find a babysitter?
- Oh, shit!
- We're going clubbing.
I feel awful.
You should! I only get weekends off!
Know why I forgot?
I found a job. On Lozach's site.
I start next week.
Oh, is that good?
Hi, gorgeous!
- Hi, gigolo.
- OK, Carole?
- Why're you back here?
- To say hello to you.
I was downtown,
but the hot chicks are here!
Nice kid... Hello.
Gotta go. Milo will bug me.
So long, little bastard!
There are customers!
You OK?
Can we have 2 J & Bs on the rocks, please?
Violet suits you.
2 J & Bs.
30 "Mali," 30 "Burkina. "
I can get you more.
No. I've earned too much this year.
Yeah, it's been a good year.
- Who's that guy?
- An Armenian.
Just bought the Park Hotel in Vaucresson.
Don't hit on clients.
What's it to you?
This isn't a convent!
You should've been a streetwalker.
Huh? Why didn't you?
'Cause I limp, Milo.
I wanted to be a wrestler.
I'd have liked to hit.
And get hit...!
How do you know I don't like that?
I've got stuff that's more used than these.
How's little Jose today?
What's he done this time?
He did it on the washbasin.
Where was Carole?
Showering.
Your wife dolls herself up!
She's not my wife
after 2 months.
You'd like her to be!
- Keep him this weekend?
- Costs more.
Are you working?
I start on Monday.
If you work, it's 300. If not, 150.
300 francs she's charging us? She's crazy!
Mom! Fatou wants 300 francs to mind Jose!
You better do more overtime, girl!
This is Jean-Jean, my future ex.
Works for the water company,
but only drinks beer!
- Can you light me up?
- Sure.
Where's the Rover?
Park it miles away again?
No, just opposite.
Isn't that your waitress?
- After midnight, she's not.
- What, then?
Just a beautiful lady.
- Well, I'll be going.
- OK, thanks.
- I'm pleased to see you.
- Oh, yeah?
So why are you leaving?
Are there too many cops inside?
Why do you say that?
I have no trouble with the police.
Still seeing that kid?
- I'm all for youth.
- And blacks?
Sure!
A pretty girl like you...
A pretty girl with a bad leg.
Didn't you notice? Didn't Milo tell you?
My Dad did it to me.
He knocked me into shape. I was wild.
In fact, I still am.
There's my car.
- Hope to see you soon.
- Me, too.
Bye!
How'll we manage next week?
I work every evening!
She's working for once!
Can't he look after your kid?
No, I start a job Monday at Lozach.
Well, I work, too, kids!
Hey, I didn't ask to be a grandma!
It was your choice.
I was in love. It happens.
In love with who?
Where's the father?
He's the Invisible Man!
- Kids come too soon.
- Exactly!
I'll take Jose, but not before Wednesday.
- Thanks, Grandma.
- That's OK.
At least he's polite. Hang on to him.
Didn't we come to dance?
Yeah.
All this talk about kids
is getting on my nerves.
Leave me alone!
Just let me die!
Let me die!
Do you like my new dress?
It's great.
- I swiped it.
- Where from?
You know, Leone's.
That real expensive store
by the supermarket.
What I do know is,
one day, you'll get caught.
I'll never get caught! I'm too smart!
Milo keeps saying:
"You're too smart!"
He tried to kiss me. I was mad.
Been out with Milo, too?
No way. Perish the thought!
Not even before you were with me?
I don't go for Milo.
He's not my type. I have some taste!
Who's Jose's father, then?
That Alex we saw today?
The passport dealer?
What do you care? Don't go on.
Come here.
Let me take my shower.
Leave me alone.
So, tell me who Jose's father is.
I won't tell you.
After 2 months,
you're bugging me like a husband.
You're the one I want.
I want to spend my life screwing you.
Let's do it in front of the bedroom mirror.
No.
I want you here.
The bedroom's too far.
Betty's story
Three weeks later
Oh, hello, Antonia.
No, but... I'll tell her.
As soon as she's back on her feet.
Yes, I promise.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Goodbye, Antonia.
- You know Antonia?
- Know what?
They're your first words in 3 weeks.
Don't get cold, on top of it.
I am glad.
How do you know Antonia?
She works for your publisher.
- Been many calls?
- Not that many.
I said you needed rest, you couldn't talk.
Did Dad call?
Every night.
Can't have been easy.
What?
Telling him...
Oh, I didn't.
Anyway, he never asked after the child.
Should we tell Edouard in New York?
Ah, the father! I tried, of course.
I couldn't reach him.
Vanished!
His newspapers
say he's gone on a literary world tour.
- Did you tell anyone?
- Tell, not to tell...
Why go upsetting everyone?
You didn't tell anyone?
Answer me!
Don't get worked up!
I told the funeral parlor.
The formalities...
The death certificate... Someone had to.
How's this doing?
Lunch with Clemence Favereaux
Back around 4. Mom
I did some tidying-up. What do you think?
Try to do some work
It's only me!
Go home, Mom. Leave me alone.
Why are you on the table?
- Who's that?
- Bernadette's boy.
You know, Clemence's daughter.
- What?
- There's a problem with their vacation.
Listen or you won't understand.
He was supposed to stay
with his godmother.
The poor woman broke her leg.
They were devastated.
They'd kissed their vacation goodbye.
The tickets, Mauritius...
First vacation in 5 years!
You telling me they're going
on vacation without their kid?
Some people leave their dog.
Shoes off!
They asked you...?
- No, I offered.
- Oh, did you?
For a week? A month?
You bring a little boy here?
How can you behave like that?
I don't believe it!
You're unfair!
Is it a crime to help a friend?
Yes, it's a crime!
I'll never get used to you! Never!
You can be so selfish!
I've looked after you!
- Devotedly!
- He's sleeping here?
Not in Joseph's room.
He's sleeping here?!
There's plenty of room.
We'll make up a bed on the floor.
- Now what?
- I'm phoning the Favereaux.
I'm returning him. Their number?
I don't know it by heart.
- They've gone!
- I don't believe you!
They're on a plane to Mauritius!
What kind of people entrust a kid to you?
Don't they know you're completely crazy?
Where are you going? Where...?
The bathroom... Want to make peepee?
Make peepee?
Come on...
Be good. What's your name?
They didn't say?
No, I don't remember.
- What's your name?
- Jo!
Sorry, it's Joseph. It's not my fault!
- Going?
- Out.
This late? It's dangerous.
Good. I may get murdered!
- Were you worried?
- You shouldn't go off like that.
Why put Joseph's jacket on him?
Why? You idiot! Lunatic!
You had my kid buried anywhere, anyhow!
- Where are you going?
- For my tests.
If we're not wanted...
Yeah, get lost!
Hospital! What an outing for him!
Oh, here's my taxi! Come on.
I'll look after him.
Stop torturing yourself.
It does me good! Come on.
Take that off.
Do you understand me?
Take that off!
I've never seen such an ugly kid!
Not bad. Is that where you live?
Where's the TV?
No, there's no TV here, pal.
I want TV!
Yell! I don't care!
You didn't want TV.
It's for you two. It'll keep you busy.
By the way, your lodger isn't clean.
He needs changing.
- I've forgotten how.
- Me, too!
Didn't the Favereaux leave any spares?
It's a funny way to look after him.
What's that?
Interested in dead dogs?
I haven't finished it.
Think I feel like reading?
Mom...
Sir wanted the TV on.
Why turn it off? 8 PM isn't his bedtime.
- What a fuss!
- Turn it on!
Mom!
- Now what?
- He wants his mother.
See to him, calm him down,
but leave me alone.
Take him out. Where's his parka?
I don't know.
When you put Joseph's jacket on him,
where was it?
I said I don't know.
It's not good for me to get worked up.
Put him to bed.
Oh, shit!
C'mon!
I'll leave the little light on.
Hope is fading of finding the boy alive...
Leave the TV alone!
I turned it off for your sake.
Do what you like!
No, it's OK.
I've watched enough TV.
Telephone!
Ah, it's you, Brigitte.
- Who's speaking?
- Clemence Favereaux.
Your mom there?
No. She's at the hospital for her tests.
You're back from your vacation?
Vacation? No.
We're not going away.
I'm phoning, because your mother
promised to visit us.
As we haven't seen or spoken to her,
we were worried.
She didn't visit?
No! She forgot us!
Ask her at least to phone us.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Thank you. Goodbye, dear.
Yes, goodbye.
So, who are you?
The search goes on
for little Jose's kidnapper
I'll make some tea.
- Where did you find him?
- No more Darjeeling.
Down in the projects.
I did it for you.
You lost your boy, I found you another one.
After Jose Novacki's disappearance,
hope of finding the child alive is fading.
This morning,
our reporter spoke to Carole Novacki,
the boy's mother. Here is what she said...
You didn't report Jose's disappearance
for 2 days. Why wait so long?
No one knew where he was.
We thought he was at his babysitter's.
Police are questioning your partner,
Mr. Diembele.
He's not my partner. He's my tenant.
A young African man?
Yes. He's my tenant.
Francois's story
I don't understand "tenant. "
She says you're just her tenant.
Did you get on well with Jose?
Sure, I got on well with him.
Not sorry he disappeared?
Of course I am.
You don't look it.
It's not like he was my own kid.
Let's go back to last Wednesday,
the day the kid disappeared.
His mom's story doesn't tally with yours.
Who was looking after him?
His grandmother or Mrs. Fatou?
It kept changing. I don't recall.
Try.
His grandma, from Wednesday on.
Before that, Fatou.
That's complicated. Be clearer.
Tell us about Wednesday,
the day he disappeared.
Again?
From the beginning.
I didn't pick just any child.
At least give me that.
I found the same kind of boy.
More or less.
Yes, more or less.
His mother must be worried sick.
Did you consider that?
No, it goes right over your head.
Do I call the cops or go to the station?
You'd turn me in?
This tea's too strong.
That would be stupid.
- Really very stupid.
- Why?
They'd immediately think
you kidnapped him!
- Me?
- Of course!
To compensate for losing your own child.
Your book got such coverage.
You're famous.
The media will have a field day,
making you a kidnapper.
But hang on, I didn't do it.
You did!
- A field day...
- You took the kid!
No one'll believe you!
They will! I'll tell them the truth!
- Truth?
- About my life!
My own childhood!
How you tried to kill me!
How you kidnapped this kid!
I'm going crazy!
You want me put away in a hospital?
Yes! That's the best solution!
So you can't destroy everything!
I'll tell them I didn't do it!
I'm going away!
Right now! Anywhere!
I'll call the police from the airport
and take the first plane!
Why would I kidnap him? I don't like kids!
It wasn't me! I won't confess!
How dare you accuse me?
You took him. Now you're blaming me.
Stop yelling. It wasn't you, OK.
Yes! OK! That's right!
Where are you going?
To clean him up. He peed himself.
You left the cinema at 5 PM. And then?
I went to pick up Carole...
You mean Mrs. Novacki?
Yeah, right. Mrs. Novacki.
Remember what the movie was?
Give me a break!
I don't give a damn about film titles!
It was some Van Damme thing.
Van Damme...
It says here you did a month in jail.
Were you dealing?
Just dope. None of the hard stuff.
I'm clean now, I'm in work.
Stop treating us like idiots, Francois.
You've been together for 2 months.
This kid's always in your way.
He cramps your style, doesn't he?
- I'm not dirty!
- You are!
So, we'll take this off.
We have to clean you up. Help me.
Early to bed tonight.
I'm taking you home tomorrow.
We'll do it while she's asleep.
What on earth is that?
What is that?
What did you do to yourself?
We need to talk.
Well, come in, then.
What do you want?
I'm entitled to know what you intend to do.
You didn't hit him, did you?
What? What are you talking about?
I don't hit children!
Well, really!
I never hit you!
Did you hit him?
You gotta be kidding.
- You're totally crazy.
- Yeah, right.
As well as the housework and dishes,
you do babysitting?
Doing her housework doesn't bother you?
- No, it doesn't.
- OK, it doesn't.
Maybe the kid does, though.
A kid that age can be a pain in the ass.
Kept your movie ticket?
- Why?
- That'd change quite a lot.
Maybe you never went.
Maybe you found Jose.
Maybe you took him someplace.
Maybe he went too far
and started screaming.
And you...
tried to calm him down.
Maybe you also went too far...
Oh, look at your face!
Cool it! We don't have any proof.
You're Mr. "Presumed Innocent. " Know it?
Isn't that a Van Damme movie?
- Can I go home then?
- Yes.
You can go home. But don't go too far away.
Stay within reach.
We'll carry on slogging away.
And one day, we'll nail you.
- When are you leaving?
- You can't wait!
- Many more tests?
- One. Friday.
The last one.
You leave Friday evening.
My ticket's for Wednesday.
I don't care. I'll pay.
You buy airplane tickets like bus tickets.
- And then what?
- Then what?
Once I've gone?
I'll tell the police.
Tell them what?
That I found him in the street.
- I'm going to bed.
- Do.
See you tomorrow.
Despite the police's efforts,
Jose Novacki is still missing.
Carole Novacki, the child's mother
today refused to make a statement.
Mrs. Novacki, excuse me...
Can I ask you a question?
Francois Diembele, the African man
who's been there for 2 months,
was held for questioning for part of the day
by local police.
He was released a few minutes ago.
What are you doing?
You going out with this whore?
Eat shit and die!
I won't let a little brat fuck with me!
Have the cops seen enough of you today?
Swallow that with some wine.
You'll have sweet dreams.
Give me your hand.
There anything left to eat?
Didn't the cops feed you?
- Hey, kid!
- Yeah.
Don't talk bad to Carole.
- Oh, no?
- No.
Show her some respect.
If I can help, ask.
It hurts to see you suffering alone.
She isn't "alone. "
- Any more rose?
- You've had enough.
I'll get some.
What a pain in the ass!
You're not "alone. " I'm here!
Know what I'll do? Dump all you guys.
I've had a bellyful of these
shitty projects.
It reeks of death.
- New hairstyle?
- Don't you like it?
I get hassled by the cops all day.
You go to the hairdresser's.
I don't wanna let it get to me!
That won't bring Jose back.
So, don't pull that damn face.
The cops accused me of hitting the kid.
Said he has marks all over.
The Armenian's muscling in!
You act like I don't belong.
I'm tired of all this.
Well, go to bed if you're tired.
Alex - 49 Allee de la Chenaie - Vaucresson
Alex...
Alex's story
Get up, lazybones.
Alex, wake up.
- Is it tomorrow?
- Yes. My taxi's coming.
- Why didn't you wake me?
- I'm going without you.
- What?
- I'm going alone, my love.
- Are you joking?
- No.
You're the one who's kind of a joke.
Must you look so happy?
I am happy!
I'm going to see the sun, my friends!
- Punishing me?
- Yes.
- But why?
- For lots of reasons, hon.
For your mocking look when...
Yes, when people think you're my son.
Your exasperated look
when I get tired at 3 AM.
How you look at girls...
For making me feel lucky
to be with a guy 20 years younger.
You still on welfare?
I'm on minimum benefit. 500 francs a week.
Not bad. I'd have thought it was less.
Very funny.
I've decided not to leave any money.
I've put the phone
and the electricity on direct debit.
- Got your Visa card?
- The machine swallowed it.
Poor darling!
Well, make the most of the house.
Feel free to use the phone
and don't catch cold.
Kiss me.
Poor baby
Bitch!
Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Busato!
5'8", 150 pounds. Fit as a fiddle!
- Is Carole here?
- No.
What'll it be?
- She still work here?
- Yes.
She does, but she isn't here.
- What'll it be?
- Nothing, thanks, pal.
You ain't the only one!
Don't hit on her.
Miss, can I see your purse?
You're still as dumb as ever!
- You scared me.
- You fell for it.
Other than faking passports,
you've never done much.
- Heart murmur.
- Even as a kid, you were scared.
Remember how I'd tell you,
"We'll make loads of money!"
- I'm fragile.
- That's the problem with you.
You're cute, you're really charming,
but are you a real man?
How dare you?
By the way, you got problems?
Your kid was kidnapped?
Some say he's your son.
That's unproven.
You don't seem too worried.
I was real depressed at first.
I have this funny feeling...
Maybe Jose's safe and sound, after all.
Maybe he found another family.
Another mother.
A good mother, this time.
I wouldn't win any prizes for motherhood.
I need to get up to stupid shit.
Nothing works the way I want it to.
Remember the sex bomb I was at 16?
I thought I'd screw 'em all.
Now I'm average.
And you? How's your life?
- Need money?
- Got any?
I'm with this poor guy, a laborer...
It's tough.
Have you got any scams
for getting cash, Caroline?
The cemetery trick on a widow.
Go to a cemetery, find a rich widow...
Yeah, I've already tried that!
I got myself one in Vaucresson
who's loaded.
I shouldn't have...
- She ugly?
- Ordinary.
A fat ass.
Know what?
She went on vacation for 3 months!
She left me alone in her home with no cash!
Come and stay if you're feeling lonely.
No way.
- But I've maybe got an idea for you.
- What?
- Her fine house...
- Yes.
Just sell it!

Betty's story
- A banana split.
- Oh, thanks.
"The mother believes he is alive
"and being well-treated. "
Leave that paper alone.
I'm going. Talk about something else.
"She spoke emotionally
"about the Christmas
she would have wanted to give him. "
Easily pleased!
Think she'll let me visit him?
Look. It's like a flower.
It moves like that
when there's some wind.
Isn't it pretty?
You'll be seeing me in 3 hours.
What? "What model airplane?"
We haven't a clue. Who gives a damn?
Yes, I'll put her on. See you soon.
He's so worked up!
Hello, Dad.
Weren't you keeping her till Christmas?
3 months! I've got her for life.
- Well, bye, hon.
- Yes, bye, Dad.
Maybe it'd be easier to tell them?
"I've found this boy. What do I do?"
I'll handle it another way.
How?
My way.
I'll miss you.
You're all I have.
You've got me and Dad.
He hates me.
Well, goodbye then.
Goodbye, Joseph.
I'm not called Joseph.
You stay here.
Wait. Don't move.
Stay there.
Where are you going?
Betty!
Are you on your own?
No, wait, he's mine.
He's mine. He's my little boy.
I'm sorry.
Alice's Garden
Oh, I like that one.
The elephant? 2 elephants.
Let's take that one. You want it?
- The big one?
- The little one.
- The little one?
- You think so?
I think we'll take the big one.
- The big one? Are you sure?
- No, he's too big.
Come on.
You're very strong.
- In you get.
- Get in the car.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Need a hand?
- No, it's OK.
You've got your hands full. Let me do it.
Is it for him?
My godson.
His mom's away till Christmas.
I'm looking after him.
Does it help you?
Does it help me?
I don't know... I really don't.
I tried to call several times.
Didn't your mother tell you?
No.
Can't wait for me to go!
What's his name?
Can I call you?
Yes, of course you can.
Goodbye.
"Mom, I've decided
I'll never give the boy back.
"Not to his mother or to the police.
Or to anybody...
"I won't send him back there.
"You won't be troubled.
"I'll be spared any apologies,
confessions or explanations.
"Only you and I will know.
"I don't want to lose him. "
- Second floor.
- Thank you.
Jerk.
Pauline is a weasel, a forest mouse.
She has lots of friends.
"Friends"?
They're the many people she loves.
The many other animals she loves, you see.
If it snowed,
what would happen?
Make a snowman!
That's a good idea.
- What'll we put here?
- A carrot.
Would you like to have a snowball fight?
Telephone!
Hello. This is Jerome Castang.
I got your number from
the hospital.
Am I disturbing you?
Not at all. I'm shopping.
How are you?
I'm in Milan.
- Pardon me?
- Milan. In Italy.
At a medical convention.
I'm phoning you,
because I've fallen in love with you.
Well, there you go.
Is it serious, Doctor?
I'll call when I get back.
Yes, do that.
Goodbye.
This the home of Betty Fisher,
the famous writer?
Given up the world tour?
No, passing through Vaucresson.
It's part of the world.
Do you mind?
Is he eating with us?
So, is this him?
Edouard's story
I called your mother.
She gave me your address.
So it seems that you need me?
She said you're not doing so good...
She said that?
Yes, that you'd be pleased to see me.
Have my company.
Margot is a bit weird.
Nice house.
All thanks to your masterpiece?
You think it's a masterpiece now?
- You read my review?
- Exactly.
- Couldn't stomach it?
- It was harsh.
- But fair?
- No. Just harsh.
Well, you sure pulled it off!
4 years in New York, a 6-month marriage...
You make it a bestseller.
What do you want: beef or fish?
- Yogurt.
- OK.
Don't you ask me?
What do you want?
No, it's OK, I didn't mean it.
One thing, though, I did find...
touching with this book,
but I couldn't put it in my review is...
let's say...
your debt to me, in a way...
This one or that one? That one? Sure?
I showed you New York in the first place.
- You want a percentage?
- No.
What I would have liked, though,
is a little word of thanks...
as an epigraph.
It would've been nice. It's the done thing.
You're talented, but badly brought up.
Introduce my son.
He's a friend's son I'm minding.
It's not Joseph.
That's a bit much.
Oh?
- You don't believe me?
- 'Course not.
I think it's pretty disgusting.
You already distanced me
from you and your success.
Now you stop me from seeing my son.
I'm not.
I said it's not him.
If it's not him,
where is Joseph?
He died.
Last autumn.
He fell out of the window,
died of a brain hemorrhage.
I don't believe you.
Check the death certificate.
- Where you going?
- I don't want him to hear.
When you "dismissed" me,
I thought you couldn't go any lower.
I hoped you changed.
Playing the grieving father
isn't your forte!
You have no idea what it's like
to go through that!
Don't mourn a child you never wanted!
"Me! Me! Me! My career!"
Remember what you said?
"I'll never understand
this need you have for a child. "
Do you know why I came?
So we could get back together.
But I'd forgotten what you're capable of,
Miss Novelist.
Making up Joseph's death...
Some stupid damn thing
to keep me from you two.
To screw everything up. Even that. Bravo!
Well, so long!
I won't let you get away with it.
You're going to have me on your back.
I'm warning you.
Sorry, I wasn't expecting you so early.
I've cut a few corners,
because my friends, the Barskys,
who are friends and clients,
have been looking for the past...
- 6 months.
- At least.
...for a property near Paris like yours.
Lots of charm, as you see.
Lots of taste!
A view of Vaucresson Hill.
Large living room, mezzanine.
Brushed aluminum.
An opportunity like this
is becoming quite...
rare in a market that has been bled dry.
Bled dry...
- Will you sell it furnished?
- We haven't discussed that detail.
Why not? We'll have to see.
- Nice, huh?
- Yeah.
It works well...
Well, they love it.
Especially her!
I said 24. They're offering 18.
Million?
It's OK, I'll get 20.
Care to think it over?
No, 20's good.
You're quite right.
Mustn't dally with Russian money.
Nor ask where it comes from.
There he is.
- How's life, Diembele?
- Great.
- Enjoy the breather?
- Yes, thanks.
That's OK, but we better close the case.
Yes. Enough playing around.
I'm on vacation in a week.
You won't ruin my vacation
in Thailand, will you?
Be seeing you.
D'you want a photo?
It's all over the papers.
I can just cut it out.
'Cause of the cops, you ignore me?
Have you all gone crazy?
D'you think I'd hurt Carole's kid?
What about when you put
some alcohol in his bottle
so he sleeps better?
Someone took the kid.
He didn't rent a hotel room.
Pass me the box of Dash, please.
Maybe the real father took him...
Who knows who he is?
He has one! He's not a test-tube baby!
No one's looking for him.
I'm sorry, but Carole had too many men.
The racing guy, the Total guy,
the guy called... uh... Alex...
- Busato.
- It's him!
- No. Why?
- It's him.
It's Alex Busato. Know why?
He's the only one whose name you knew!
That's no proof.
You didn't forget his name.
He kidnapped Jose! He's hiding him.
And I know where.
If you smile, I'll bust your head open!
You're from the projects.
- What're you doing here?
- I don't know you!
What about Jose Novacki?
And Carole? Carole Novacki!
Now listen: I won't take the rap for you.
I wanna live an ordinary life
with Carole, you hear?
I won't let a motherfucker ruin my life!
I can hurt you, too.
Asshole!
Some prepare their vacation,
others answer the phone!
Police.
Jose Novacki... His father kidnapped him.
Alex Busato.
49 Allee de la Chenaie, Vaucresson.
Who are you?
Merry Christmas.
May I?
I went shopping in Paris. So, I thought...
My husband was in such a rush.
I only got a glimpse.
- It concerns our future.
- That's pretty.
- Is it mink?
- Blue fox. Does that shock you?
No, why?
That I'm covered in animal pelts.
Give me a hand.
I want to see the bedroom. Coming?
Terylene is a little bland
for a bedroom, isn't it?
Sorry, excuse me.
I'll open the door.
- Get in touch.
- OK.
- Don't wait too long.
- No.
Mr. Busato?
Police.
- You Jose Novacki's father?
- Me?
No, me!
No, but I... Who told you that? Carole?
It's a serious case.
Abducting a minor. No news for weeks.
We've just been informed
about your possible paternity,
so...
You think I'm hiding him here?
We'll just have a quick look around.
Go ahead.
Almost as nice as my house!
- Well, Merry Christmas.
- Our apologies, sir.
That's quite all right.
Merry Christmas to you, too.
Goodbye.
Who could've told you about him?
- I don't know.
- Some asshole.
I hate these long days.
Holy shit.
I'm quitting!
Keep him in bed.
See you tomorrow. Sleep tight.
Good night.
This is Jerome Castang. Merry Christmas.
Thank you. Merry Christmas to you, too.
Can I come and see you?
When?
Now.
I'm doing this so badly.
No, you're not doing badly at all.
It's not very convenient.
You're not alone?
Yes, I am, but...
What's your address?
Betty? It's Edouard.
Your husband, remember? Are you home?
OK, you're not home.
Well, where are you on a night like tonight?
What about poor Edouard's Christmas?
You're making it worse for yourself.
I have a proposition.
Propositions are for before, not after.
What's your proposition?
To go away.
Go where?
To Canada.
I've had a job offer. A new hospital.
I have a month to make up my mind.
And how long have I got?
As long as you want.
If you say no, I'll be sad.
I'll still read your books.
Is he the problem?
Who?
Hello. Want breakfast?
Come on.
What's your name?
His name's Jo. Jonathan.
His mom's staying here over Christmas.
She left him with you on Christmas Eve?
Canada goes for him, too.
- Where's Carole?
- I don't know! At the bar?
No, pal. She's absent!
What's she up to?
You don't know where your girl is?
She's playing you for a sucker.
Alex has stolen her!
That shitty two-bit pimp!
A woman's precious.
Gotta look after a girl like Carole.
Aren't you sick of these guys around
her who don't know what love means?
Oh, I love this little painting.
Is it a Marco Gilli?
You starting to have regrets?
No, no regrets. I'm just wary.
You might get carried away.
You might be a pervert
who gets carried away.
You might tell your husband.
Just for fun!
Can you get me a drink?
A vodka or something.
What if your husband goes crazy
and won't buy the place?
My, you're anxious!
I'd like an answer.
You buying the damn house?
My husband's OK with the price.
No problem there.
- But 20 million...
- ... is a big check?
Exactly.
- Maybe there's another solution.
- Yes?
If you sell us the house "officially"
for 15 million instead of 20,
we'll give you 5
in cash.
In dollars. What do you say?
I raise the price by 5.
$10 million cash.
You launder twice as much, OK?
Asshole!
Are you OK?
You look pale.
It's winter.
Go ahead.
It's only natural...
See, it does work. You have to be patient.
Helping out a friend?
6 weeks is a lot of babysitting!
What do you want?
You think I'm jealous, huh?
Jealous of your success?
That's all over.
Do you know what being a writer is?
Ever thought about it?
Do you get up early to write?
No, not at the moment.
No one understands my writing.
You know that.
You're doing great,
you move in higher spheres.
I'm still a small-time journalist.
To each his own.
But why not do it together?
Tell me why I should support you.
I'll give you a reason. A good reason.
Him.
The kid...
I watch TV, I read the papers.
Little Jose who disappeared...
Poor Betty.
How could you do something so dumb?
You're like your mother...
You're a bit crazy.
I said a gun, not a rifle.
It's all I've got.
It's 2,000. Know how it works?
I don't have 2,000. I'm unemployed.
I can rent it to you. 500 a week.
Hey!
Why didn't you go to bed, hon?
Think of the kid's real mother,
Carole Novacki.
She doesn't care about her kid!
Seen her face on TV?
She obviously doesn't care.
She whores, does lousy jobs,
her boyfriend's out of work.
She's bound to agree to...
That's right! To sell her kid to us.
They're poor! The poor will sell anything.
Listen! I've fixed up a meeting with her.
Tomorrow night.
She saw there was money in it.
She was very keen.
- Offer her money?
- Right!
We dump the kid somewhere
we're sure he'll be found.
He goes back to his mother.
A year later,
no one will remember the kidnapping,
and Carole gives us what we bought.
How high can you go? A million?
Hey, that's life, kid.
Don't look at me like that.
You have no choice. I know everything.
What a bunch of morons!
I saw it already.
- Not worked in 8 days?
- 10.
I'd had a bellyful of the Ranch!
I'd had enough of Milo!
I've got a great new job.
Receptionist at the Park Hotel.
Night receptionist?
That's right, but at least I work!
I'm not on welfare! I bring home the bacon!
You've smoked all my dope?
Oh, no, here it is.
- Want me to do you one?
- No.
This hooker gear's for work?
Don't you like my knickers?
Everyone else does.
Seen the watch? It's a Diagem.
It sparkles, but it's not real.
The Armenian can't hire me. It's an advance.
- The Armenian?
- Yes. I like working for him.
He doesn't keep asking after Jose.
It does me a lot of good.
Enough with this Armenian!
- You weren't with him.
- Oh, no?
Why ask me, then?
It wasn't the Armenian.
- You were with Alex.
- Get off my back!
"Where were you?" "Who with?"
What's it got to do with you?
We're not married!
You're no use!
Can't even earn 100 francs!
You were with your Alex!
He's Jose's father! I'll get him!
- I'll fuck him up!
- You won't! Nobody's Jose's father!
Know how many guys I had that week?
Eight, nine, I don't know!
His father's one of that lot!
Or one I had the week after! Who cares?
The last day
Ready?
Let's go.
"You can never replace a child. Ever.
"But you can love another.
"Not the same love, but it's love.
"For someone else...
"When you read this,
I'll be at the other end of the world.
"I know it's unfair, to you and to me.
"I did enjoy getting to know you.
"But nothing's possible between us.
"I'm leaving for reasons
"which concern my past life
"and big secrets
I'm unable to share with you. "
Can I talk to Carole Novacki?
- Who is it?
- Is she there?
I want you out
I hope you'll have gone when I get back
Tell her it's about Jose.
It's OK for tonight, 8 PM
at the Belgian Bar.
Who are you? Are you Alex?
Just say, "8 PM, Belgian Bar. "
My wife's waiting in the cafe opposite.
Why are you calling me?
Your guy phoned.
Meet him at 8 at the Belgian Bar.
Bye.
- Who was it?
- Nobody.
Open it and check.
- Come on.
- No! No way!
Orly, quick!
There's 400 francs on the clock.
Never mind.
BELGIAN BAR

Let's go.
A few weeks later, Betty wrote to
her mother from Singapore.
She did not blame her for the past.
She was eternally grateful to her
for this child that Margot had given her.
Betty got a letter back from her
with excellent news about her health.
She ended: "Who is this 'Joseph'?
"I thought your son was called Jose. "
