Let me emphasise
that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive,
both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an
Infantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWII, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing
serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall,
they were trying to arm you better.
<i>We were tryin' to make you better.</i>
Banner's work was very early phase.
It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working
on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him
what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto,
that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's
whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working
on weapons, right?
- No.
- But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
- So why did he run?
- He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45?
- 39.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now,
with your record.
No, I'm a fighter.
I'll be one for as long as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now,
put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone
I wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange
something like that.

- Oh, my.
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you out of your mind?

- What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?

You know, I know a few
techniques could help you
- manage that anger very effectively.
- You zip it. We're walking.
Okay.
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.
Oh! Dr Ross!
- I have someone who'd like to meet you.
- Okay.
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?
Mr Green?
I got to tell you,
I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much
power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man
shaking my hand.
But, look. We're not strolling
into the park for a picnic, here.
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode,
if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress
that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this
by even the smallest integer
we're dealing with concentrations
with extraordinary levels of toxicity.
- You mean it could kill him.
- Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.
You should know that there's
a flip side to this, too.
If we miss on the low side,
if we induce me and it fails,
this will be very dangerous for you.
Look. I've always been
more curious than cautious,
and that's served me pretty well.
So, are we going to do this?
How you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay. On the table.
These will protect you from yourself
if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later
if you thought it was strong.
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.
Okay...
You, you, you.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.

We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote
with your blood.
Except the antidote will only take hold
once we've achieved a full reaction.
Just relax.
Okay. We are comprehensive.
Here you go.
All right. We set to pop?
I'd take your hands off him.

Hi.
Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing
I have seen in my entire life!
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.
We need to go back and talk
about what just happened in there.
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse
came from the amygdala.
- I think Dr Ross's primer...
- Are you okay?
...lets the cells absorb the energy
temporarily, and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die
of radiation sickness years ago!
Now, maybe we've neutralised
those cells permanently,
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter,
but it's hard to know
because none of our
test subjects ever survived.
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer!
- Wait, wait.
- Wait, what did you just say?
- They weren't getting
- the myostatin primer...
- No, no, no. Test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.

so we had to go bigger.</i>
And we still don't know which is more toxic,
the gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood?
- Bruce, this is all you.
You didn't send me much to work with,
so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error,
there's no end to what we can do!
This is potentially Olympian!
This gamma technology
has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans
impervious to disease!
No, no, we've got to destroy it.
- Wait, what?
- All of it.
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.
- Is this the whole supply?
- What...

I will never forgive what you've done to him.
He's a fugitive.
You made him a fugitive
