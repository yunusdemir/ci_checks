<i>No place you can go in the world

<i>We's the first on this planet.</i>
I been here a long time.

This old lady, she stopped me.
She said...
"Running around,
catching up all that light.
In moonlight...
black boys look blue.
You blue.
That's what I gon' call you.
Blue."
So your name Blue?
Nah.
At some point you gotta decide
for yourself who you gon' be.
Can't let nobody make
that decision for you.
How you like swimming, man?

That's all I'm gon' say about that.
Thank you.
What's a faggot?
A faggot is...
a word used
to make gay people feel bad.
- Am I a faggot?
- No.
No.
You can be gay, but you gotta let nobody
call you no faggot.
I mean, unless...
How do I know?
You just do.
I think.
You'll know when you know.
Hey...
You ain't gotta know right now,
all right?
Not yet.
Do you sell drugs?
Yeah.
And my mama...
She do drugs, right?
Yeah.
Okay, deoxyribonucleic acid.
Long word, right?
All right, it's basically genes.
I know y'all don't know what that means,
but just hang with me for a second.
So it's basically this long--
Chiron, you need something?
Hey, yo, that nigga forgot
to change his tampon.
I'm sorry, Mr. Pierce.

Ain't that right, Little?
All right, Terrel,

Nah, can't be enough for Little.

All right, Terrel, that's it.
Hey, what you gonna do, Chiron?
I fuck you up.
Hey, yo, Terrel! Out!
Come on, man.
What's wrong with you?
Where were we? So DNA,

Damn, nigga.
You straight spaced, dawg.
Yo, school been out.
You ain't going home?

- My bad--
- No, I'm playing, yo.
Look, I wanted
some quick head, you know,
but this chick all like, "Hit that shit,
Kevin. Hit it with that big dick."
Why she got to compliment a nigga for?
So I'm like, "A'ight, like, shit,
we can do this", you know?
So I started
banging her back out, dawg.
I'm talking
I'm banging her back out.
She went and made
all this fucking noise, though.
So Aimes come in,
acting like 5-0 and shit,
almost had my ass suspended, dawg.
I talked it out, though, you know.
I told him we was like childhood
sweethearts and all of that,
so I just got detention.
It's cool.
<i>- Cook

Real talk though, I gotta go, a'ight?
Before this fool change his mind.

Find somewhere for you to be.
Find somewhere for you to be.
All right.
Water for me...
and a little gin for you.
Boy, please.
I know Juan used to give you that gin.
But we ain't doing that
up in here, shorty.
You don't think
my joke was funny?
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm good.
No. I've seen good
and you ain't it.
Stop putting your head down
in my house. You know my rule.
It's all love
and all pride in this house.
You feel me?
I can't hear you.

All right.
Thank you for this.
Boy, please, you know you can stay here

Okay? Any time.

Thank you, Teresa.
I mean it.
Now, if you gon' stay here, though,
you gonna have to learn how to make
a bed better than this, boy.
- What?
- What you mean, "What"?
Give me that.
That ain't how you make up no bed.
You think you slick, too.
You know, do it all wrong so Teresa
can come over here and do it right.
I know what you doing.
Oof, you and Juan.
Y'all two, thick as thieves.
Give me that.
All right.
Do you need anything else
from me, sweetheart?
- Uh, no, I'm good.
- Okay.
All right, I'm gonna
wake you up in the morning.
You good, Black?
Chiron!
- Hey! Hey, baby!
- Hey, Mama.
- Where'd you go last night?
- What?
Why?
Well, I'm yo' mama, ain't I?
Why you ain't just
come home later, boy?
You had me worried about you.
<i>I guess you getting grown.</i>
I can't be keeping up
with you all the time.
Anyway, baby, how Teresa doing?
I ain't seen her since the funeral.
Listen, Mama locked herself
out the door, yeah?
Can you come let her in?
Come on, baby.
Let me in, baby.
Baby, come on.
I thought you said--
Mama, I thought you--
Wait, Mama-- Mama!
I need some money.
For what?
That's my business.
Don't you ask me no shit like that.
- I don't have no money--
- No, no. Don't lie to me, boy.
I'm your mama. That bitch over there
ain't no kin of you.
I'm your blood, remember?
Now I ain't feeling good.
I need something
to help me out.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Where am I supposed
to get money from?
What?
Teresa ain't give you nothing, huh?
Your li'l play-play mama ain't put
something in your hand?
Give me that damn money, Chiron.
Give me the damn money!
Give me the damn money!
I don't have no money!
- Mama, come on--

Yes. That is what I thought.
I know that bitch like a hooker

You my child, okay?
And tell that bitch
she better not forget it.
Go on to school.
Ain't you late?
So you can see how a lack
of white blood cells
can be dangerous
to the human body, right?
Okay, can anybody explain
what will happen to the body
if there's not enough
white blood cells?
Ain't nobody's leaving this classroom
until I get a response.
This is more important for you
than it is for me, trust me.
Hey, yo, Little!
<i>- Fuck.

Chiron and trouble
always found a way.
Yeah... somethin' like that.

I'm a cook, man.
<i>You a cook?</i>
Yeah, buddy.
Man, I got sent up for some stupid shit,
the same stupid shit
we always get sent up for.
They put me on the kitchen line, man,
and... kinda took to it.
<i>Anyway, man, I just--
I just thought about you, man, I...</i>

<i>So, uh...</i>
<i>Hey, man, if you ever come to town, man,

Maybe play that song for you.
<i>All right, man, um...
You be easy, all right?</i>
How you been?
I'm all right.
I ain't sleepin'.
Why not?

Maybe not even a counselor,

Might as well help other folks.
Keep myself out of trouble.

So, you still in them streets?
Didn't come all the way

I know that.
But yo' heart ain't gotta be black
like mine, baby.
I love you, Chiron.
I do.
I love you, baby.
I mean, you ain't gotta love me.
Lord knows I did not have love for you
when you needed it, I know that.
So you ain't gotta love me.
But you gon' know that I love you.
You hear?
You hear me, Chiron?
I hear you, Mama.

I'm so sorry.
Come here, Mama.
Be right with you.

Hey, hey...

Don't look like your ass

Yo, sit down, man,

You gon' drink with me.
Boom.
Nah, bruh, nah, bruh--

Welcome back, bruh.
Damn, brother, I thought

Can't really taste it,

You don't wanna waste none of that,
do you? It tastes good.
Chill out, man.

"It's straight."
Man, please, it's better

Chill out, bruh.
My Spaghetti-O's go hard, man.

Eat your dinner.

Fine-ass Samantha.

Who you doin'?
Man, come on now. I've been back there

Hey, these grandma rules, man.
You know the deal.
Your ass eat, your ass speak.
All right... straight up?
Yeah, nigga, straight up.
I'm trappin'.
- What?
- Yeah.
When they sent me to Atlanta,
put me straight into juvie
for beatin' the old boy.
Met this dude in there.
When I come out,
he put me on the block.
Did good at it and rose up.
It is what it is.
Bullshit, man.
That ain't what it is.
That ain't you, Chiron.
Nigga, you don't know me.
I don't know you?
There you are.
Twenty-four fifty.
Want the change?
- All right.
- Bye.
Why you got
them damn fronts, man?
Why'd you call me?
What?
Why did you call me?
I told you, man.
- Dude came in--
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
He played this song, man...
This you?
You wasn't playin'
'bout them traps, huh?
Ride dirty, huh?
Something like that.
<i>So, how you be gettin' to work?</i>
Bus. Jitney.
Sometimes Samantha shoot me out there
when I got Li'l Kev.
I can't picture bein' in Miami
with no car.
- Man, it's real out here.
- Yeah, I bet.
Real hot, real slow,
and real busted.
Shot me like a duck out here, man.
This nigga said "a duck."
- Yeah, you on one. You on one.
- You know what I'm doin'.
Nah, I'm just tired, bruh.
Hey, man, bet on the ride, though.

- Appreciate it.
Yeah, man.
Can't have yo ass on no Jitney.
So, Chiron...
What-- what you looking at me

What, man? Come on,

Yeah.
Like you was just-- you was just on one...
and you hit the highway?
Yeah.
So where you gon' stay tonight, man?
- Watch that shit.

Come on in.
Get yourself at home.
- This is real, man.

You a'ight?
No. Yeah, no, I just

Man, you a lightweight.
Nah, you was pouring that mug.
You was pouring it.
- "I can't taste this".
- Chill out, man.
We had like three bottles.
Yeah, three bottles. I'll make you
some green tea, man, come on.
I won't be drinking

- What do you drink?
- Water.
Who is you, man?
Who, me?
Yeah, nigga. You.
I'm saying, man, them fronts.

Who is you, Chiron?
I'm me, man.
I ain't tryin' to be nothin' else.
Oh, okay.
So you hard now?
I ain't say that.
Well, then what?
Hey, hey, hey, I ain't tryin'
to hem you up, man, it's just...
I ain't seen you in a minute and...
It's not what I expected.
Well, what did you expect?
You remember...
You remember the last time
I saw you?
For a long time,
tried not to remember.
Tried to forget all those times.
Yeah.
When we got to Atlanta...
I started over.
Built myself from the ground up.
Built myself hard.
What about you? You--
Me?
I wasn't never really worth shit.
Just kept on, man.
Never really did anything
I actually wanted to do.
It was all I could do was to do what folks
thought I should be doing.
I wasn't never really myself.
And now?
Now?
Now, man...
Now I got li'l Kev.
Got this job.
Another 18 months of probation.
That's some real shit, man.
Nah, man, it's a life.
You know?
I ain't never had that before.
Like...
Like, I'm tired as hell right now, man,
and I ain't making no more
than shoe money, but...
I ain't got no worries, man.
Not them kind
what I had before.
That's that real shit.
That's that Bob Marley shit, nigga.
You the only man
that's ever touched me.
You're the only one.
I haven't really
touched anyone since.
