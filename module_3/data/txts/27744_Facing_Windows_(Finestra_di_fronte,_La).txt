You've been weird since we Ieft
the market, what's wrong?
Nothing! Does there have to be
something wrong?
We've been out for an hour
and you haven't said a word!
We got the groceries, came
downtown and you're silent!
If you're mad at me, say so.
Stop wearing that face
I'm not making a face, you're
the one who's always pissed off
Let's go over there
If l'm mad I don't shut up
and hoId it in Iike you!
Oh sure, you're aIways right,

I'm not aIways right,
but I am this time
Come on, you like to fight
You could stick up for me
just once!
You made a scene because she
cut into the Iine
- Butshe was ahead of us!
-When l tried to apologize,
she jumped on me like a maniac
and you kept quiet!
What was I supposed to do?
You don'tsee the face you make
when l taIkto peopIe
-You're ashamed of me
-Whatare you taIking about?
You were screaming. Even the
cashier said you were wrong
Did you see how she pointed
that penciI at me?
Yes, but you didn't need
to telI her where to shove it
Okay, maybe I went too far.
Then she asked the Romanian
if she had enough money to pay.
Whata racist!
Listen, putthat money away.
There are peopIe around...
He's lost.
He can't remember his own name
Maybe he's got I.D.
Do you have an identity card?
No, not money, identification
-What about in his pockets?
-What, shouId l frisk him?
I'm very confused...
I don't rememberanything
Put your money in your pocket
Give it a minute,
you'II remember
-We can't just Ieave him!
-What can we do about him?
He's folIowing us!
- He's not foIIowing us
-Yes, he is!
Don't worry
We'Il take you to the poIice
station near our house
They'll know whatto do
You know how many people

Detergent on the right,

You're the one

Martina, can you hear me?

Good evening

- He told me
He got his memory back
He told your daughter

He's asleep
from overexertion
Did he just telI you
or did you ask him?
-Why are you whispering?
- So l don't wake him up
If you let him sIeep, wiII you

Sir? Simone?
You have to wake up.
We have to go, wake up
No, FiIippo!
You're not Ieaving him here!
- He couId be a maniac!
-You're exaggerating, Giovanna
He'Il sIeep near the kids!
You're crazier than he is!
Stop yeIIing

Watch how he wakes up now!
Great, he made himseIf

-You resoIve this situation!
- Look! You made him cry!
Stop that tone

And l'lI report you to a cop!

Turn out the Iight,
l'm coming
- Go to sleep!
- l'd go to sIeep,
- butthis guy's awake!
- I don't feel Iike it
We sleep together once a week
and you don't feel like it?
No, Ieave it open. l don't

- No, he'Il hear us this way
-We'Il do it with a silencer
- l reaIly don't feel Iike it
-Come on, sure you do!
Good morning!
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-You were sleeping so niceIy
Look Mama,
Simone made breakfast
-Where is he now?
- He's in there
He made a mess with the eggs,

Have a crepe
- No, l don't want anything
- l heIped him, you didn't!
Martina, go do your notebook
Yeah, and do Marco's too!
Remember, they

-What time do you start?
-At seven, Iike always
- Haven't they changed the shifts?
-Sure they have
lt's just that they gave me
the night shiftagain
-You always getcheated
- I was the Iastguy hired
l have to hurry now,
I hate doing things in a rush!
He's in there
He's going, today
l'lI take care of it
Today
Don't worry, I promise
What's wrong?
- Have you seen Chen SuiIan?
-Why?
- Have you seen her?
- Sure, don't you see her too?
- That's not her
-What's the difference?
-What happened to Chen SiuIan?
- She works two jobs,
her sister repIaces her
and she has no working papers.
The bosses know this trick of using
the same name for relatives who come
- It doesn't work anymore!
-What are you, an SS officer?
-They asked me to investigate
-You teIl them it's not your job
You do the accounting.
What does that mean?
-You count peopIe?
- How can I say no to them?
With your mouth!
Hi!
Hi Mama,
look what we got
-What's aIl this?
-Wait or l'Il crash
-What have you done?
- l'lI expIain later
- How about expIaining now?
-Are you happy now?
- No, I'm playing!
- Let Marco play too
No, he doesn't know howto play
- l didn't buy it, okay?
-You took money from that man?
- No, he gave it to me
-You know what that's called?
- ExpIoiting the vulnerabIe
- Don't yeIl, he'lI hearyou!
He'II hear me?
Why the fuck didn't you
bring him to the poIice today?
l did and I made a report.
Ijust couIdn't leave him there
- How much did you take?
-They'lI calI and let us know
l didn't take his money, are
you crazy? He came with me
to get the kids from school and
he wanted to buy them a gift
He told Martina to pick one,
you know how grand she is
Yes, but you've realIy Iost the plot!
l can't sleep with him here
Take him to the pub and leave
him at the station on the way
Sure! This way I'm aIways
the one who's the shit!
They're not for us,
l seIl them
-Are you a pastry maker?
- To earn some extra money
l make them twice a week
for my friend who owns a pub
But l'd have Iiked that
l would have Iiked
to open a pastry shop
Why didn't you?
I didn't have the money
You could work in a pastry shop
if you Iike it that much
Sure, at 29 years old with
2 kids, I'd be an apprentice
with a husband who gets himseIf
fired alI the time
I know it's hard to quit,
but at Ieast when you bake
you shouIdn'tsmoke.
You used
tap water
and you didn'teven taste it
to make sure
there wasn't too much chlorine
Pardon me. I'Il use
mineraI water nexttime
Do you have a favorite brand
to suggest?
You'II find the right one.
Try it when it's cold
and when it's heated.
The water mustalways be clear,
have no smeIl,
be pleasant to the taste
and be absoluteIy low
in aIkaIine
How do you know alI this?
Maybe I knew someone...
who knew how to bake very welI
Then you must remember
something
lf I'm late
at the poIice station,
would you put my kids to bed
after yours?
-Want Giambo to go with you?
- He is just what l need...
l'lI take two minutes,
wait for me here
No, you couId have brought them
a littIe Iater
for closing time!
Sorry, l'II bring them early
next time, life is a mess at home
Send your husband if you're in
a mess, or don'tyou trust him?
lt's you I don't trust!
He works nights anyway, so...
Excuse, excuses. If I had the
chance,I'd show him a good time
Do it! You'd get him off
my back then!
- Trouble is, he'd never do it
- Oh yes he wouId
- lsn't Giorgio enough for you?
-StilI?
After 15 years,
it's incest now
- Irene, the cash register
- I'm coming!
I can't,
I'm in a rush
Relax a bit oryour brain
wiIl blow up, honey
By the way, the pies
aren'tseIling very welI
What can I do foryou then?
That's my favorite question.
Make sure it's good
Be serious,
teIl me what you want
How shouId I know?
Invent something, shock me
Make something new
You think that's easy.
'Bye
Pardon me, I think your
grandfather isn't feeling well
I was standing by him and he
was saying some strange things
-Then he waIked off
- He's not my grandfather
Sorry, it's just that
I saw him with you before...
I live in the building
across from you
ReaIIy?
l don't know who he is,
we found him in the street
The poIice said
they'd inform us
iftheyfind out anything
Where did he go now?
I met him
there in front of my car
Excuse me, but you took him
to the poIice
and they Ieft him
in your care?
- lmpossibIe, right?
- lt seems a bitstrange to me
You're right. I wasn't the one
who brought him anyway
WelI, he can't be too far
He's not welI
-What's wrong with him?
- His memory is gone
What's the name?
Giovanna
I'm Lorenzo.
But, I meant his name
Oh! Simone
l shouId have taken him to the
police before going to the pub
Now whatcan l do with him...
l can't chase him around
aIl night
You've been very kind,
but I'd better go home now
Simone, what are you doing?
Why did you get out of the car?
My Iife is aIready a mess,
you are just what I need!
Come back to the car
l'lI take you where you want
We can go ask again,
maybe they've found out
-where you lives
- I'Il take you there
No, thanks anyway
My car is right here.
Two people are better than one
l'm sorry, I'm taking up
so much of your time
Don't worry about it,
I'm not working tomorrow
- They're coming!
-Who's coming?
Don't get upset
- Let me out. l have to get out!
- No! Whatare you doing?
Simone, wait!
- I'll go with him
- Okay, I'Il catch up
No, please! Let me go!
Lorenzo! He's not feeling weIl!
Simone, what's wrong?
Nothing
I just need...
to sit down for a bit
Good evening, Mario.
l'lI have the usuaI, please
- Sorry, I'm notMario
- Then have Mario come
No one named Mario works here
-Whatdo you usualIy have?
-Vermouth
- I'Il have a beer, pIease
- Make that two
Who are you?
Lorenzo. We were in the car
together just now
We met in front of the pub,
remember?
No.
What kind of work do you do?
l work in a bank
Do you like it?
I guess so. I'm about to become
a branch manager
Your wife wilI be pleased
WelI...l'm not married
You're not married atyour age?
Why not?
I don't know
Maybe I haven't found
the right person yet
Whatabout you?
-Whatabout me?
- Do you like your job?
- Do you like chicken?
-Yes, it's aIright
l work in a chicken factory
l'm in accounting.
And l don't like it
I like your cakes very much.
The ones you bring to the pub
How did you know I make them?
I've seen you quite often
and I go to the pub a Iot
And Iike I told you,
I Iive across from you
You've never seen me?
Maybe l have
Maybe in the neighborhood
Or maybe from my window
I don't know, what with
everything I have to do...
- Sir?!
-Oh, excuse me
Have you seen Sara? They're
even taking babies away!
Please heIp me find her,
pIease!
Help me find her
Rememberto take the money
out of your jacket
These are Filippo's.
They might be smalI for you
Ijust need time to wash
your things, put them here
I don't like the sweater
You haven'teven tried it on
I don't like the coIor
AIright, I'Il get another one
for you
This robe is for you...
it's blue!
l'lI take your clothes
to the cleaners tomorrow
Do you understand?
- HeIIo?
-Giovanna? lt's Lorenzo
Sorry to caIl so Iate,
but I looked up your number
and l saw you were stiIl awake
Yes
After I left you at your car,
I lost you and
Ijust wanted to know
if he's aIright
Yes, he's taking a shower
I couIdn't...
I couldn't teII you before
what he said to me
when he stopped me
So, here we are
My friends had gone
and I was getting into my car
At a certain point,
he was almost on top of me
He spoke to me...as if
he were talking to someone eIse
He...it was actually as if
he were decIaring his love
I don't remember
the words exactly now
''I'Il aIways Iove you''
More or Iess
that's what he said
And then?
''We have to Iove each other
secretIy,''
''because no one...no one
wilI forgive our Iove''
What did you answer?
l didn't know what to say
It was a bitembarrassing too
Then he just stopped.
He Iooked me in the eyes
''l don't want to give up
our love. Do you?''
He reaIly said that?
Yes
For a moment I was...
I tried to give him an answer
Any answer. I don't know
how he took it
You didn't understand
who he was taIking to?
No, but he was convinced he was
talking to the person he loved
So he wasn't taIking
about me...l mean
about her. About the woman
that he couldn't love
What was he thinking about?
Who knows how it ended...
Take him to the poIice tomorrow
Yes, l have to take the kids
to schooI and shop, but...
You can aIways caIl if
you need a hand. I'Il give you
- my mobile number
-Alright
Is everything alright?
Is everything alright?
Listen, I'm coming in
Whatare you doing?
You couldn't sIeep?
You couIdn'teither
Did the children stay
with your friend?
Yes, but Emine's kids
sIeep here often too
I Iike the way your husband
plays with his children
Yes, FiIippo is a good father
Have you known him long?
We've been married for 9 years,
but were together before that
It was different
in the beginning. Then...
Then the worries, the children,
like everyone eIse l guess
It must be beautiful to watch
Iove grow that started only as
passion...
and to heIp itchange,
to protect it
from the passage of time
WeIl,
that's notaIways easy
Do you like to dance?
Yes, but I haven't danced
for years
lt's been longer for me
- Martina, hurry up
-We'll be ready in two minutes
-What time is it?
-Too early for you
l'II take the kids to schooI
and then go shopping with Emine
I swear I'Il leave him
at the poIice station today
No, I have to take his clothes
to the cIeaners Iater
AIright,
just don't compIain Iater
l took him to the pub
Iast night. I almost Iost him,
but thank God I got heIp.
You know, thatguy that...
Alright, I'Il telI you
some othertime
You be quiet,
l'lI talk to her
Comb your brother's hair,
it's sticking up
lt took me an hour
to get it Iike this
Don't yelI,
you'll wake him up
She doesn't understand,
she's an old Iady
He doesn't care about the oId man.
He wants to do you!
Come on, he hasn't even
thoughtabout that
Don't you think
l'd have noticed?
He spied on you
just Iike you spied on him!
I didn't spy on him!
You've been acting out a soap opera
for months
- For this afternoon, pIease
- This wiIl take three days
Please, it's reaIly urgent
It's Saturday, we're cIosed
this afternoon. No way, sweetie
It's a human issue
lf someone begs you
there must be a reason!
Come on,
it's important to her
Pass by Iater and knock
on the grate
Just this once, got that?
Nice suit, very fine fabric...
-Whose is it?
-What's it to you?
He's hitting on you, he even
knows how you Iike your coffee
These were in the pocket
-What's he doing with rocks?
- He throws them at busybodies!
Oh, heIlo!
Right now?
l don't know,
how can l do that?
Yes, that's a good idea
Where?
AIright, the same coffee bar.
Fine
The same coffee bar!
Do you two
have ''your song'' yet?
- Good morning
- Good morning
- Sit down
- Thank you
Would you like something?
-A coffee?
-Yes, a coffee, thank you
Two, pIease
- How is Simone?
- He was asIeep when I left
l had to wash him Iast night.
I saw numbers on his arm...
- From a concentration camp?
-Yes
He took us here
to theJewish neighborhood
I wanted to tell you, I calIed
a policewoman friend of mine
She said there's been no report
of anyone finding an oId man
- They know nothing about this
- That's what I thought
She'lI let me know if anyone
reports a missing person
- I see you're getting involved
-Yes, a bit
Thank you
- Milk?
-Yes, a drop
No, l don't take sugar
- l can'tstay here Iong
-Alright, we'lI hurry
How is it that someone like you
took a stranger home?
lt wasn't me. It was
my soft hearted husband
He goes overboard when itcomes
to heIping someone
In fact, it seemed odd.
With your kids in the house...
What do the kids
have to do with this?
No, I onIy meant that...
it seemed rather strange
What did you think strange?
Whatdo you know about me?
It's true, I hardly know
anything about you
I onIy know
that you take your chiIdren
to school at 8 every morning
Yourfriend, who has bIack
children, is aIways with you
I know thatevery night
after you wash the dishes
you stay in the kitchen
to smoke a cigarette
You put out your cigarette
under the tap water
I know you often wander
around the house at night
You go to the window
and Iook outside
But I don't know what you see
- Good morning
- Good morning
- l'd Iike some information
-Certainly, what is it?
Would you happen to know
an eIderIy gentleman
caIled Simone?
No, no one comes to mind
He's lost, he remembers nothing.
He's staying with her for now
I think he's
a concentration camp survivor
How can you say that?
He has those numbers
on his arm
He stopped here in front
of your shop last night
He knocked on the grating
as ifhe knew this pIace
very weIl
He may be one of your customers
Are you sure his name
is Simone?
lt's the onIy thing
he remembers
- Did you make a poIice report?
-Yes, but there's no response
Listen, I've worked here
for a very long time
Maybe if you brought him here
l'd recognize him
l'm sorry. We're not Iooking
forany missing persons here
Itseemed the name Simone meant
something to you a minute ago
lt struck me because this
Iady's brother was named Simone
But itcan't be him.
Simone died many years ago
in a concentration camp
Excuse me,
where is your car parked?
-AIong the river
- Mine is the other way
Goodbye
-Why was your celIphone off?.
- It wasn't, I was at the bar
Maybe itdidn't receive there
Look, it's on.
I never turned it off
lf you say so
Didn'tSimone go outwith you
this morning?
Oh sure,
l took him shopping with me
- He wasn't here when I woke up
-Where is he now?
-You said you'd stay with him
-What did I say?
I said l was going to the
cleaners, you stupid shit!
-You're realIy a balI buster!
- l can never trust you!
I know you didn't make a police
report! I'm sick of this!
- It makes me even sicker!
- Then do something!
Take some initiative!
Just one thing!
Whatam I saying? You can't
even get on the day shift!
Give me time for fuck's sake!
It's a new job!
Do you call checking the gas
on trucks a job? Fuck you!
Is it my fault? You forget
l Iost the job the auto shop
to a family member.
lfitwasn'tfor the kids
l wouIdn't be breathing
gas fumes alI night!
You could stop breathing
for whatthey pay you!
Are you throwing money
in my face now?
I've aIways had a job!
Who gave you this house, huh?
lfI'm correct, if your mother
hadn't passed you the Iease...
At Ieast I had parents
who heIped us!
True, I didn't have any
But l'm not Iike you
At least I'm not like you!
Why? What am l?
Go on, say it!
What am l to you?
I'm a failure?
Am I a faiIure?
Right?!
You're a real bitch!
My dear Simone,
After you,
red is no Ionger red
The blue ofthe sky
is no Ionger blue
The trees are no longer green
After you,
l have to search for colors
in the yearning I have for us
After you,
l miss even the pain
that made our love
timid and secret
I regret the waiting,
the relinquishing,
the coded messages,
our stoIen glances
in a world fuIl of bIind peopIe
who didn't want to see
because if they'd seen us
we'd have been their shame,
their hatred, their cruelty
l regret I haven't yet had the
courage to ask your forgiveness
And that is why l can no Ionger
even Iook inside your window
That is where I always saw you
when I didn't
even know your name and you
dreamed of a better world
Aworld where a tree was not
forbidden to be a tree,
or for bIue
to become the sky
I don't know
ifthis is a better worId...
now that no one
caIls me Davide anymore,
now that everyone caIls me
only Mr. VeroIi
How can l say
this is a better world?
How can I say that
without you?
l have to leave
in a few days
l'm being transfered
to the lschia branch
It must be a beautiful isIand
Yes.
But not now
It's aIways like this
l'm never good
at guessing the right timing
Afew days ago, I thought
this promotion wouId save me
lt's the last thing l want
right now
It seems l always get
what I want at the wrong time
Everything's fine as long as
l'm dreaming of something,
but then when I try
to make that become reality...
l don't know how to expIain it,
sorry, I know, but...
It's just that I...
l'd stay sitting on this bench
forever,
even though l know
it would never be possible...
Just Iook at
how you're dressed
You have to be cleaner, more
polite, better than other kids
That's easy
if everybody eIse is Iike you!
Martina!
Say you're sorry right now!
You weaned this kid
on viper's milk!
HelIo.
May l please speak to
Mr. VeroIi?
Mr. Davide VeroIi
-Who is this?
-You wouIdn't know my name
You don't know me.
TeIl him I'm Simone's friend
-Simone?
-Yes
Just a moment
Mr. Veroli
is sleeping now,
please caIl back Iater
You may also Ieave me
your teIephone number
HelIo. We spoke yesterday.
I have an appointment
-with Mr. Davide Veroli
- Come in
You're not bringing bad news,
are you?
Why bad news?
You never know. I expect
just aboutanything from Iife!
Davide shouIdn't be seeing you
However, don't agitate him.
Diabetes! Heart! Depression!
His problems are worse than
other peopIe's! Understand?
- l'm sorry
-You're telIing me
Justthe effort it takes
for me to give him a piII...
There's nothing worse
then someone who refuses
to take care of himself!
Stop putting on a show, Sara
Why don't you go
make us some coffee?
''What's your name,
what's your name''
Martina constantly asked me
The onIy name l had
fixed in my head
was Simone's
I read it, I'm sorry
I thought itwould heIp me
to find you
In fact, you found me
Simone never read this Ietter
When you found me
that morning
l was on my way
to our meeting pIace
Simone and l had
a secret meeting pIace
We left our messages there
Everything we couldn't say
in front of anyone eIse
or on the teIephone,
we wrote
We hid the messages
between the stones
of the fountain
l made you worry,
didn't I?
Yes
Why?
Everything is ready
l don't taste things
as I once did
Come here.
Taste this chocoIate
Did it break immediateIy?
l didn't notice,
it's melting
QuickIy?
-Yes
- It's the grain
It must have an aImost
imperceptibIe graininess
Then once it's meIted
it must leave a sweetsensation
that lasts for just a moment,
and then the thing that counts
is the bitterness
Yes, that's what it tastes Iike
Do you taste the perfume
ofthe vaniIla?
Yes, but...distantIy
Distantly...
Yes, distance
You've transformed your passion
into a hobby
You shouIdn't treat
your talent that way!
Do you know the pastry shop
on Via Giustini?
-VeroIi's?
- Davide Veroli. It was his
He was a great pastry chef, an
artist famous all over Europe
- Have you known him Iong?
-A lifetime
l owe him my Iife
He was the one who saved me
on October 16, 1943
You don't know what
l'm taIking about, do you?
No, I'm sorry
The Nazis...began at dawn
and continued all day
to Ioad entire famiIies on to
their trucks
Men, women,
old peopIe, babies
Not only in the Ghetto,
but in aIl of Rome
Davide did everything to warn
as many peopIe as he couId
He saved a lot of chiIdren
thatday
That's why he was given
medals and honors...
For what it was worth...
-Whatdid you do for him?
-Why?
You don't know how truly
priviIeged you are
He's never aIlowed anyone
to make pastry with him,
much less give them
his baking tooIs
Are you a pastry cheftoo?
l don't know, maybe it was...
alI the Iove in the Ietter
that never made me think...
they were two men
I didn't realize it either,
but then...
OnIy after
l thought about it again...
Mama
- I'm on the telephone
- lt's been an hour!
The second time he has to go
home, why isn't Tom Thumb
-abIe to find the bread crumbs?
-I don't remember
-The birds ate them
- The birds, the birds ate them
But wasn't it pebbles he Ieft
aIong the road?
Everyone remembers fairy tales
in their own way
Do you stilI have
a lot of packing to do?
l guess so
He's a dead end
Look, he wants to sIeep with
you and then he'II take off
Anyway, he'lI be in lschia
and you'Il be here
Alright, but would he spy on me
for months just for a fuck?
Then telI him you're leaving
everything to run off with him
to live your dreams of love
on the island.
Watch how fast he disappears
Listen, l'm working overtime.
WiIl you wait for me?
No, I'Il take the bus
Fuck him!
Yes, have yourseIf a good fuck
It's the only way
to get him out of your head.
Go home, make yourself pretty,
Ieave the kids
to sIeep at my house,
and that's the end of it
Don't make that face,
it's not a tragedy
Look, if you do it welI,
do it very weII
Come in
I tried to give the place
some atmosphere
Maybe I went overboard
l'lI put them out if you like
No, it's very nice
lf you knewfor how long
I imagined this...
And now you're here
and I can kiss you.
I can kiss your mouth,
your face,
your eyes
You never stop,
did you know that?
You're always moving
Day after day
l watched you,
you became an obsession
for me
l came home early
just to watch you
I hid behind the curtains
l waited for you to go out
to see where you went
lt was enough to know
thatyou were there
and there were times l couIdn't
tear myseIf from the window
in the hope that I'd see you
for one more instant
From that window?
Yes
With this transfer you'lI have
a lot of responsibilities
Your Iife wilI change
completely
A new pIace, a new job,
new friends
-It'II be hard at first, but...
-l'm not asking you to come
I can give you
alI the time you want
Why do we have give this up?
I know it's difficuItfor you
lt's difficuIt for you
to be with me
But it's even more difficuIt
for me to Ieave you
l owe you 13 euros
l'II give it to you
atthe end ofthe month
HelIo.
l've brought back his suit
Giovanna, come in, pIease.
Hurry!
But I came only
to give him his suit
- No, please come inside
- Has something happened?
The air is too humid.
It's no good for pastries
lt makes it harder to knead
the dough
You didn't telI me
if the chiIdren liked
the cake we made together
I'm sorry, they liked it very much.
Emine wentcrazy for ittoo
That woman shouId go crazy
with a good diet
Today is not the day
to make pastries,
they're turning out badly
Are you sure he told you
the truth?
lt wasn'teasy, he didn't want
to talk. But when I aimed
the gun at the baby,
he told me everything
He made a list of everyone
stilI hiding vaIuabIes
You can'tgo wrong. l'm not
Ieaving. Is everything ready?
Yes, the German troops are here.
In haIf an hourwe'II surround
the Ghetto. What about thatJew
who works with you?
-WiII he warn anyone?
-Who? That queer?
No, he's harmless.
I keep an eye on him
lfhe dares to Ieave here...
I beIieve you! I'm going,
but keep an eye on him
l saved many peopIe that night
The same people
who Iaughed at me,
who didn't beIieve
in my sentiments,
who wouIdn'taccept
that l could love Simone
And to save them,
I Iost him
I was at a crossroads,
can you understand that?
But instead of running
to Simone,
l chose
to warn the others first
l had to show
that l was worthy ofthem,
to save them first
wouId be my redemption
Where did you Ieave
the chiIdren?
With Emine
You mustn't trustanyone!
Every neighbor
couId be an informer, a spy!
-They're not in danger
-Yes, they are! Run,
go home, hide them, take them
as far away as you can!
CaIm down, Davide,
nothing's happened!
There's no time to Iose,
they'll be here any minute!
- The chiIdren are safe
-Oh, the indifference...
That's your disease.
You're blind and deaf
They've stupified all of you
with their propaganda!
You must...
You must run and warn
everyone you know, Giovanna
Before it's too late!
Alright, Davide, l wiIl.
JustcaIm down now
We're here with you,
nothing can happen
l'm not afraid for myseIf
I can't do anything now
But you...
you stilI have a choice
You can change, Giovanna
Don't be content
to merely survive
You must demand
to live in a better worId,
not just dream about it
l didn't do that
Are you awake aIready?
I never went to sleep
Has something happened?
I've decided to quit my job
In two hours
l'II take the kids to schooI
and then l'lI go to work
and give them my resignation
Why?
What's the reason?
l'm sorry
l thought something happened
to you at work
That you were forced to do this
No.
This was my choice
l shouId have done it sooner,
but I don't think it's too late
WhatwiIl we do now?
What wiIl you do?
I want to work
in a pastry shop
HeIp me, FiIippo
HeIp me
- Here they are
-Where's my other bag?
I'Il go get it
- That's very welI done
- I know
Then why did you want me
to check it?
To show you how smart I am!
l've never had a doubt
lt's me!
Hi.
Did you find a job?
No, l had some interviews,
but l'm too oId to apprentice
Did you make these for the pub?
- No, they're for us
- They're not fattening, right?
- No
- lf you get any fatter...
You little...
He's downstairs,
he's moving out
Should l put raisins
or aImonds in the cookies?
Both
-We're done
- Good.You lock up
My dear Davide,
Since you Ieft us forever,
Martina asks me of you often
She stilI calIs you Simone.
I'll telI her your story soon
Yesterday at work,
for the first time l was asked
to make a cake by myself.
Guess which one l made?
The head pastry chef didn't
comment, but it was added
to the list of cakes to be made
for Sundays
l think that's a good sign
Filippo was abIe to get on
the day shift
ltseemed as if he'd won
the lottery, he was so happy
and I understood that l can't
ask more of him right now
You know, when l think
of Lorenzo,
l'm afraid l'm aIready
beginning to forget his face,
that I can't remember
his voice anymore
What is he doing right now?
Who is he smiling at?
l stilI need your advice,
Davide,
one of your gIances,
one of your gestures
But then suddenly I'Il feeI
your gestures in mine,
and I recognize you
when I speak
Does everyone who Ieaves you
aIways Ieave part
of themseIves with you?
ls this the secret
ofhaving memories?
If that's true,
I feeI much safer
