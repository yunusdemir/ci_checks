KINGSNAKE69\Tremors 2 Aftershocks 1996
Wildfire, you either walk
into that other corral
or I'm going to shoot you and
drag your carcass in there.
Come on, Wildfire.
Come on, boy.
Let's go meet Susie now.
You'll like her.
You two gotta
get together.
Got you!
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, boy. Whoa! Whoa!
Damn it.
Now you and Susie are going
to make me some little birds
or I'm gonna take some
barbecue sauce to both of you.
Earl Bassett, right?
I told you
that's the other one.
Senor Bassett.
This is beautiful country,
but very isolated.
I had great difficulty finding
you, but I'm glad I did.
You see,
we have had to close down one
of Mexico's biggest oil fields.
Several workers
have been killed.
We have now determined
that the men
were killed by
certain large
underground animals.
Graboids.
Ah! I told you that's
what they named them.
Excuse me.
You mean,
there's more of them?
Yes.
The company is facing
very expensive delays.
But more importantly,
there are many
isolated people who
live in the region.
Many lives are
in danger.
We need someone,
an expert,
to eliminate
these creatures.
You want somebody
to go graboid hunting?
Si.
Senor, please!
Please, we have already spoken
to your partner, senor McKee.
He is unwilling
to help us.
Sure, Val married a good
woman. Why would he want to die?
Of course,
we are willing to pay.
Of course,
they're willing to pay!
Okay.
Fifty thousand.
Go away.
No, no, no.
He wants to pay you
50,000 for each graboid.
Look.
No way.
Not for any amount
of money.
But for you, getting those
worms would be a piece of cake.
Who are you?
And why are you so dumb?
Oh. Grady, Grady.
Grady Hoover.
It's an honor to
meet you, Mr. Bassett, sir.
I'm probably
your biggest fan.
That Reebok commercial with you
guys running through the desert.
So very cool.
You like that, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Listen, could I come in?
I mean,
just for a second.
All right.
Great.
Thanks.
The Earl Bassett.
Oh!
Yep. I've read
every one of these.
I got two copies
of this one.
I keep one wrapped
in plastic.
Oh, my God, you got
your own one of these!
I bet you made
a fortune off this.
Quarter, quarter,
quarter, quarter.
Well, somebody did.
It sure wasn't me.
Well, you must
have got a percentage.
I should have
got a lawyer.
Wow.
That sucks.
Did he really
say 50,000?
Stack of Bibles.
Forget it.
You boys don't know
how mean these things are.
Well, okay,
but...
That was my big chance.
Yeah, but Mr. Bassett...
You only get one
of those in life,
and I blew it
on goddamn Big Bird
and his scrawny girlfriend!
Yeah, but 50,000.
Guess what
she's doing there.
Who?
Ooh.
"Miss October, 1974"?
Yeah. She's there to
remind me not to keep
chasing after things
I'm never going to get.
But why wouldn't
you get this?
Earl, Mr. Bassett.
You're the expert. You guys
kicked ass with those things.
And this time, you'll
be a step ahead of them.
He said the Mexican army is willing
to give you whatever you want.
Dynamite.
Whaa-bam! Fifty G's!
Maybe this is your
big second chance.
Senor Ortega.
You've got a deal.
Bravo! Bravo!
And I'm going
with him.
Muy bien! Muy bien!
If you'll excuse me.
What?
Why do you think
I drove all this way?
When he said he was looking
for the Earl Bassett,
I knew opportunity was knocking,
and for once I was home.
I don't even know you.
I drive a taxi, I live
in a crappy apartment,
I watch too much TV,
et cetera, et cetera.
Look, you're going
to need a partner.
And how many people
do you know
who would actually want
to do something like this?
I'll do anything you want.
Carry luggage, make coffee,
light fuses.
Well, maybe you
will come in handy.
Ha!
When they are eating you, it
will give me a chance to get away.
Uh-oh. Who gets
the last soda?
One, two...
What?
Scissors, rock, paper.
One, two, three!
What's this?
Scissors cuts paper.
I win.
Um...
Welcome. Welcome, gentlemen.
You made good time.
Sooner we get here,
the sooner we can leave.
This is Pedro, the
company's chief engineer.
Mucho gusto.
I have all your
equipment over here.
Oh. By the way,
I have some good news.
We are prepared to offer
you double the price,
if you are able to capture
one of the animals alive.
Double?
Alive?
Have you ever seen
one of these things?
It is only a suggestion.
If it was possible to
capture one of them.
No, now, you never know.
Earl, you never know.
Yes, I do.
I never should
have come down here.
The army has sent
everything you requested.
You have asked
for some, uh,
unusual things.
Earl, please check this out.
Look, this isn't
some kind of party.
I know that.
I just think we should show
a little enthusiasm here.
Let me introduce you to Kate Riley. Hi.
She is the geologist
for the oil company.
And these are the men...
I know, I know.
The monster hunters.
I saw you on
Good Morning, America.
Or one of those.
Yeah, this is
the Earl Bassett,
the one and only.
That's right.
Nice to meet you.
Really nice to meet you.
I'm Grady Hoover,
the new guy.
Nice hat.
Thanks.
Gentlemen, I hope to
hear some good news soon.
Miss Riley will stay
in contact with me.
Let us know anything
else you need and...
Well,
best of luck to you.
So, this is the place.
I'll show you around. Are you
thirsty or anything, you guys?
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.
Anyway, we've been
pretty nervous down here.
Glad you guys were willing
to come all this way.
Yeah. It sure is
in the middle of nowhere.
Well, of course.
Stuff like this
only happens in
the middle of nowhere.
Hey, Julio.
Hey, Kate.
So?
It's all done. They're
all working. Yes! Yes!
Guys, this is Julio.
He's been setting up
the seismographs
they talked to you about.
Earl, Grady.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I've seen you
in the magazines.
Oh, actually, I'm not the original guy.
You know, you must have
made a lot of money, huh?
The royalties on that
video game alone! Ooh!
Julio, we should be able to get
an accurate count now, right?
Yes, yes. You know, I have a friend
who invested
in that company.
Hey.
Oh, hi.
Come on in.
So...
We were gonna
look over some maps?
Right.
Coffee?
Yeah, black.
How were those burritos,
anyway?
Um...
Good, good.
Yeah,
sorry about that.
Pretty bad, I know. But with the
cook gone, that is the best we've got.
So, uh,
how many of you are
still working out here?
Only the three of us. They had
to shut the whole operation down.
Six people got killed.
People I knew.
Oh, well...
How come
you stayed on?
You're not scared?
Shit, yeah.
I'm scared.
But I'm also
fascinated. It's...
With me,
fascinated usually wins.
Maps.
I'll get these cores out
of the way. Come on, baby.
So...
Have the graboids come
near the refinery yet?
No, so far
they've left us alone.
They stay
about 20 miles north.
That's where
the workers were killed.
Who named them graboids,
anyway?
A friend of ours,
Walter Chang.
He named them,
then they ate him.
Hey, guys,
look what I made.
Just, you know,
drag it behind the truck.
Make, you know,
make more noise.
You see,
graboids hunt by sound.
I'll probably just go hook
that to the back of the truck.
Moonstrose.
Si.
Mr. Hoover,
come here please.
I have
the monitor working.
Okay.
We've set up radio
seismographs all over the place,
so the monitor will show
you where the graboids are.
Cool.
You know, this is none
of my business, I guess.
But you guys are
going out there alone?
You don't want to
take with you, like,
the whole army
of Mexico?
Let me explain something to you, Julio.
Graboids, they got no
eyes. They hunt by sound.
Now you make a noise,
even a little footstep
they are gonna
come after you.
Now we get a bunch of
people running around...
Graboids gonna spread
out all over the place.
No, we want them
all to come to us.
So you guys are what?
You guys are the bait?
That is the plan.
Okay. So,
that's us.
That's our truck.
Seems like everything's
working okay.
Sure it is, Earl. This is a
high-tech, professional operation here.
Hey, we got a good plan going.
Fifty thousand apiece, baby.
Ho! You know, I'm going to get
mine all at once, just stacked!
Well, if I make
any money this time,
I'll invest it
conservatively.
Hey, you shaved.
What?
No, I just... I just noticed
you, you know, shaved.
So what? A man can shave, can't he?
No, you're right.
She's a babe.
Well...
Here is where they
are supposed to be.
Man, look at
that country, huh?
Yeah.
Not a lot of rocks
and boulders out there.
Not much to climb on if we
don't want to get slurped.
There's mountains
all around.
You said they can't
get through mountains.
I said they can't
go through rock!
These hills are
alluvial.
Oh. "Alluvial. "
Wait a minute. That's
the little dingleberry
in the back of
your throat, right?
You want to hunt graboids,
you better know geology.
Here, you drive. I'm keeping
my eye on this seismo-jigger.
Ooh. Good call.
No offense, Earl, but you're
nervous as a Chihuahua.
I'm not nervous.
I'm alert.
Whatever.
Those worms have to be
deaf if they don't hear us.
Hey, take it easy, huh?
Whoo! Jesus! Grady, we got one!
It spotted us! It is
coming right toward us.
Well, that's the idea.
Yeah, I know
that's the idea.
Doesn't mean I have
to like it. Now stop.
Stop already,
will you?
Okay, time for
the secret weapon.
Careful with
that detonator.
Set it like I showed you.
How dumb
do you think I am?
Catch me later
on that one.
He's coming in.
I think he's following it.
Of course he is.
I can't see it, Earl.
Earl, I can't see it.
Left. Left.
Left!
Okay! Okay!
Wait. Wait, there.
He did it. He took it.
Okay. Hit it!
Hit it! Get him!
Oh, shit. What are you doing? Hit it!
Hit it! Hit it!
Hit it! Hit it, Earl.
Fifty G's, baby!
Fifty G's!
Oh, shit!
Told you.
I forgot.
Man, this stuff
really stinks.
Yeah, don't forget to
get that antenna, too.
You left the radio
on the ground?
Sorry, I forgot.
Is that a coyote?
Yup.
Man, he better
keep quiet.
Yup.
He took it.
Hey, it's my turn.
No, come on, Earl.
Let me get one more.
Shit.
Rock breaks scissors.
I win.
It does?
I told you one stick
would be enough.
You're right.
That makes 300,000.
Apiece.
I'm feeling
light-headed, Earl.
What are you gonna do
with all your money?
Invest it.
Yeah, of course,
invest it, but...
Even at 5%,
I'll be doing good.
5%?
You're talking mutual funds
or CDs or something?
That's right.
That's small, Earl.
You're thinking small.
See, I'm thinking big, okay?
I'm thinking theme park.
Now, "Grady Hoover's
World of Natural Wonders. "
Whoa.
Or, you know,
maybe something simple.
Like "Monster World. "
Or "Monsterland. "
Or "Worm World. "
How about "Loony World"?
Seems to fit.
Get off the ground!
It's vision, Earl.
Vision is what
separates the average...
I know that song.
Jesus!
Get off the ground, Grady!
Get off the ground!
Whoa!
Jesus, man,
those things are huge!
Be quiet!
Did you see
that mouth?
Oh, no.
It snagged
the chain.
Can it do that?
It can't be that strong.
Son of a bitch!
Hit the brakes!
I am! I did!
It doesn't work!
Earl, what do I do?
I don't know. Do anything!
Oh!
Cliff!
Oh, no.
He stopped.
He stopped.
Oh, shit.
Oh, come on.
Rock!
He's going under it!
Turn! Turn the wheel!
Turn!
I'm trying!
I'm trying!
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm all right.
You all right? Wow.
Chain broke right off.
Jesus, we're lucky.
Well, truck seems
to be all right.
Earl.
That's gonna be the first
ride in my theme park.
Doesn't anything
ever get you down?
Well, I'm blessed
with a sunny disposition.
Most people see
to like it.
Oh, yeah.
What does this do
for your disposition?
I think we're
gonna need some help.
Help?
Who'd be crazy enough
to wanna help us
with this mess?
The big guns pounded enemy
positions for 72 straight hours.
It was the deadliest
bombardment of the siege.
Yeah?
Hey, Burt. It's Earl.
How are you doing?
Listen, um,
this sounds kind of funny
because I'm on a radio phone.
It's the only way we can
call out of this place.
Earl?
Oh, Earl!
Haven't seen you
in a while.
Well, I haven't seen you.
Guess you've been
laying kind of low, huh?
Laying low?
No. Negative.
I've been real busy.
Lots of projects.
So, how you
and Heather doing?
Well, she, uh...
She's still
visiting her sister.
Yeah?
You know, she actually
blames our problems
on the collapse of
the Soviet Union?
Well, you did take that
kind of hard, Burt.
Said I was too
hard to live with.
Said I couldn't handle life
without the threat of global war.
What kind of thing is that
to say to a man?
Well, I don't know,
Burt. I guess it...
Anyway, it takes more
than that to get me down.
I've been
running around so much,
it's lucky you
caught me at home.
Well then,
in that case,
I don't know if you would
be interested in this.
I'm down in Mexico, see.
And I find myself in
a sort of situation.
What kind of situation?
A graboid kind
of situation.
Hey, you keeping
an eye on that monitor?
Yeah, I'm watching it.
They're just staying up north.
Oh, my God!
What?
Sorry. Come here.
Come here.
Look at this.
I've been staring at this
fossil for over a month,
and I just realized
what it is.
Hey, Earl, that looks like one
of those spikes on their sides.
Okay,
it resembles one.
I think it is.
I really think it is
a fossil fragment
of a graboid.
Now, I know it's gonna take months
of testing to prove this. But I...
Now, this is important,
isn't it?
Science has never
determined their origin.
I read that
in People.
And that's true.
But that's
not the only thing.
You guys,
this is Precambrian rock.
Precambrian.
Precambrian.
That means that this is
the oldest life form
on the planet.
I mean, other than, you know,
one-celled things. But look at that.
Wait a minute, now.
Older than dinosaurs?
Way.
So they're from Earth, right? Yeah.
Damn. I always thought
they were from outer space.
Doesn't
look like it.
Look at the size
of that! Look!
It ain't no graboid.
It's something
more dangerous.
Monster HQ,
I presume.
Hey, Burt. Good to see
you. Earl, good to see you.
This is Kate, Pedro. Kate. Pedro.
Julio, and... The pleasure is mine.
Grady, Grady,
Grady Hoover.
Yeah, I read all
about you, Mr. Gummer.
Yeah,
it's a real honor.
Yes.
Man, you think you got
a big enough truck here?
Is he the new guy?
So, did you get me one
of those seismo-monitors?
Hey, no problem.
Hey, what the hell you got
in this thing, anyway?
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Don't touch.
Don't touch. Easy.
Mexican army
gave me this truck
and a few little items
on my wish list.
Ho!
It's, uh, a bit much,
don't you think?
Maybe I'm wrong.
Hope I'm right.
Makes my homemade stuff
look like cherry bombs.
Thermite, C-4, TNT,
high-explosive, H. E.
Is there such thing
as low-explosive?
Well, yes, son.
There is. I mean, the federales
offer you anything you want
and you guys take
one case of dynamite?
What the hell is
this thing for?
That might end up
in my collection.
Hey! Got some new equipment
for you, gentlemen.
Your backup weapons.
Can you handle
a firearm?
I'll check him out.
Shotguns?
We're not hunting
rabbits down here, Burt.
Not shotguns. Double
rifles. Elephant guns.
Wesley-Richards 480,
375 H & H mag.
Cockdown power up the
yin-yang. Treat them well.
But hold them good and tight
to your shoulder,
or they'll break
your collarbone.
So where is Mrs. Gummer?
She didn't want to come?
Why don't you get this
stuff in our truck?
Sure, no problem.
Look, man.
I really want to thank
you for coming down.
We're in
pretty deep here.
Oh, forget it, Earl.
To tell you the truth
if I didn't get
out of that house
and do something,
I was going to go crazy.
Heather's not coming back.
No?
She called me and told me
to send her the HK91.
Ouch.
Yeah.
So...
Anyway,
it'll be good to get into
something constructive.
Oh, my.
What is this?
Grizzly single-shot
50-caliber BMG,
based on a World War I
anti-tank cartridge.
Anti-tank?
Had the bullets custom
cast from solid bronze.
Man, Burt. You put a whole new
shine on the word "overkill. "
When you need it
and don't have it,
you'll sing
a different tune.
Well, this is it, Burt.
Okay. I'll patrol east.
You take the west.
You know, those are
terrible for you.
You need complex
carbohydrates. Lower those LDLs.
I already gave up smoking,
Burt. What more do you want?
Have an MRE.
A what?
Meals Ready to Eat.
Freeze-dried,
foil sealed.
It's got to be foil. Plastic
is not an oxygen barrier.
Includes entree,
cracker pack, cheese spread
mixed fruit, beverage
powder, spoon, coffee,
cream substitute, candy,
salt, matches, toilet tissue.
Shelf life of 10 years.
Here, take a few.
I buy them all the time.
Saves trips to the supermarket.
Oh, no, Burt. We don't want
to use up all your food.
No problem.
Brought 120 pounds of it.
Good luck, compadres.
Oh, man, this stuff
tastes like toilet paper.
That is
the toilet paper.
14 May.
1500 hours.
I have a confirmed
graboid reading.
I'm now employing the technique
pioneered by Earl Bassett
to make my first kill.
Subject has
taken the bait.
Preparing to fire.
Memo.
Four pounds of
C-4 may be a little
excessive.
Yo! Grady and Earl.
I got one. Over.
Yeah, we know, Burt. We
heard it clear over here.
Damnedest thing, too. It had a
big chain hanging out of its mouth.
Damn it.
Burt, you skunk,
that one was ours.
Oh, yeah, son? I didn't see
your name on it. Over and out.
Why did we invite him,
anyway?
Hey! Pay attention.
Whoa. We got one.
Wait a minute.
It's moving away
from us.
It must be
something else.
Like what?
A giant prairie dog?
Well, shit, I don't know,
Earl. It's moving away from us.
Should we follow it?
What the hell is
the matter with him?
We're making plenty
of noise.
I don't like it, Grady. They are
getting smarter. That's what they do.
They got some kind
of plan going here.
I tell you,
these boys are
up to something new.
They're digging
a trap for us,
or playing possum.
Or something.
Holy mother!
Oh, man! Oh, no!
Shit, how could
I do that?
I've got to get
to Burt's gun!
Whoa.
Where is he? He should be all over us.
I don't know.
What is that?
Can they do that?
That's a new one on me.
Jesus, Grady. What are you
doing? Get off the ground!
I know, I know.
I've got an idea.
Trust me.
Damn it, Grady.
Come on back!
Earl,
he's still there.
What the hell
is it doing?
I have no idea.
Something is wrong
with him.
Must be sick.
Probably ate somebody
that didn't agree with it.
Jesus, Grady.
It's okay, Earl.
He's not going anywhere.
Hey.
We just caught
ourselves a live one.
That's $100,000, Earl.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do, carry him back?
We just
wrecked the truck.
Oh, yeah.
Hello,
this is Earl to anybody.
Anybody there?
Hey, Earl, it's Kate.
How are you guys doing?
Well...
We kind of wrecked
our truck a little bit.
You what?
Are you okay?
Yeah. We're fine.
We are gonna need somebody to
come out and fetch us, though.
Let me talk to her.
Just for a second.
Look, would you
tell Pedro to bring
that big old truck
of his out here?
It's got a crane
on it, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Whoo-hoo!
It's going to take him
hours to get there. Whoo!
Tell him to bring it
out here because...
We're going winch
that slinky on board
and haul his ass off
to Monster World.
Will you shut up, and
get off the damn ground!
I'm off. I'm off.
Jesus!
Damn it, he got himself another one.
The man never sleeps.
Guys, Burt here.
Doing a little
night-fishing.
Got three of them
on a cluster charge.
I'd say we're about
even now. Over.
Come on, Burt.
This isn't a competition.
Who's competing?
I'm just saying the score's
tied, that's all. Over.
Well, son,
no, it isn't.
'Cause we just caught ourselves
a live one. How about that?
A live one?
How in the...
Well, that's just a little trade
secret. Happy hunting, Burt.
I'll bet that
burnt his skinny ass.
God almighty!
Something's wrong
with our worm, Earl.
Well, what do you
want me to do about it?
Maybe something's trying to eat it
out there. Coyotes or something, huh.
Well, they'll have
plenty to eat, won't they?
Come on, Earl.
We have got to protect
our investment here.
We can't just sit here.
Jesus, listen to it!
Poor thing. Well, don't you
just feel a little sorry for him?
No.
That's cold, Earl.
Where's that Pedro
and that damn truck?
Something ate it!
In two minutes?
Well, something
happened to it,
because there is
nothing left inside.
Something came
out of it.
What do you mean,
something came out of it?
Yeah, it did that thing that things
do when they change, you know.
There's a word for it.
It turned into something else,
like a caterpillar does.
Only I bet that
whatever came out
wasn't no sweet
little butterfly.
Damn worms never
cut you any slack.
I said, I think you all ought
to head out to Rio Verde.
Clear out until we know
what's going on. Over.
Kate, did you get
any of that? Over.
Shit! Now what?
The radio's out. How could that
be? I was just talking to her.
Oh, man! You know what
that is, don't you?
Yeah.
Another one's doing it.
There! There's Pedro!
About damn time.
He stopped.
He stopped?
Maybe he's
taking a leak?
That's a long leak.
Hey, Pedro! Pedro!
Well, maybe we should go
over and see what's wrong.
Go over? You mean, walk a
mile across open country?
I'm not going six feet
from that seismo.
Come on. There's no graboids
anywhere near us right now.
Now I say we go
while the going's good.
You know, you could
carry some of this stuff.
I got what I want.
Well,
I can't say
this looks good.
Pedro?
Hey, Pedro!
Man!
This brings
back memories.
Jesus! Looks like somebody
took a can opener to the thing.
Oh, man, look at that
engine. It's torn to pieces.
Pedro!
Damn it!
Where are you?
Hey, there he is!
Pedro?
Oh, God!
It's a whole new
ball game.
A whole new
goddamn ball game.
Well, you know
what to do, right?
Right?
I don't know shit!
Okay! Okay!
We can hike over
to that radio tower.
They have got to have
a radio that's working.
We can call direct.
14 May. 1900 hours.
I've been out of radio
contact for several hours
unable to reach Grady
and Earl or anybody at HQ.
The situation dictates
that I return to base.
A further mystery.
I haven't had a single
seismic reading in hours.
Yet I tracked one of the sightless
brutes right into this valley.
Where the hell did he go?
They do get smarter.
Is it possible he learnt
to avoid the unique sound
of my deuce-and-a-half's
mil-spec engine?
I do not have the answer
at this time.
No, no, no. Don't tell
me that's the radio stuff.
I can't
believe this.
Oh, man.
Can't we ever get
a goddamn break?
If we get out of here alive,
I'll count that as a break.
I mean, there wasn't even
any people here to eat.
They're doing this
on purpose, man.
They're cutting
us off on purpose!
Quiet. Quiet.
I told you
they get smarter.
Hey, look.
Oh, yes! Yes!
It's not going
to have a key.
So I'll hot-wire
the damn thing.
I like that.
Grady. Grady.
What is that?
I don't know, but it's coming this way.
Jesus!
How big is this thing?
What the hell is that?
Is that it?
Sure ain't
no damn ostrich.
How does a 30-foot worm
turn into that little thing?
It might hear us.
Shit! It heard us.
Wait.
We got it!
Ugly little toad.
No eyes.
Wow.
Just like the big ones.
Earl, man.
We ought to take
this one with us.
You crazy?
What?
Sounds like
a bunch of them!
Come on, man!
Let's go! Let's go!
I'm trying!
I'm trying!
Let's go!
Pedro.
Can you hear me?
Earl, come on!
Talk to me.
Burt? Anybody?
God! What the hell is going on?
Oh, man.
Hey.
Julio, man you scared me half to death!
Sorry.
Shit. You know the radios, they're out.
No, I know.
I know that.
That's what I've
been doing here.
I think the repeater towers
are down or something.
How can that be?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Something coming
our way?
No! The creatures have completely
disappeared off the screen.
It's weird.
Well, if the radios
are all out,
shouldn't everybody
come back?
Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.
I don't like this.
This is not good.
Okay. Okay, stay here
with the seismos.
And then I'm going to go
to look for them right now.
Okay, but...
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
No!
Get him!
Get him!
Bastards!
Kate!
What are they?
What are they?
We don't know.
The worms changed somehow.
Now we've
got these things.
Julio! Julio! They...
I know. I know.
We got them, though.
We just blew them away!
Pedro!
Did Pedro find you?
No. They jumped his
truck. He's dead, too.
Have you seen Burt?
Did he get back?
No.
I tried to call him, I tried
to call you. The radio...
Excuse me. But I think
we should get going.
You okay? Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, no!
Not again!
They wrecked our car, Pedro's
truck, the radio tower.
How can they
be so smart?
Let's get
our butts inside.
I mean, what the hell
are we going to do?
Let's get
these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.
Grady, Grady. Come on!
All right. All right.
How many of them
do you think there are?
All right, I remember, I remember.
There was three
big sacks or bags
in that one we saw
split open, huh, Earl?
Can't be more than three of
those things in each worm.
Yeah, that's right,
I guess.
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.
So if all eight of them
changed, that would make...
Twenty-four! Twenty-four
of those things left!
How many
have you killed?
Let's see.
We killed one on the radio
tower and one out there
and one on top
of the car.
That's it?
Well, I'm sorry.
No. It's just that...
I mean...
Oh, man, now what?
Thank God. It's Burt.
Yes!
They didn't get him.
I think
they did get him.
Burt!
Burt?
You okay?
Burt?
I feel I was denied
critical,
need-to-know information.
Well, we're
sorry, Burt.
I mean, they just changed
all of a sudden, man.
We would've warned you, but
they knocked out the radio tower.
Come on, Burt.
What happened?
Well, when the
radios went out,
I decided to return
to the refinery.
But en route, I find I'm
in an ambush situation.
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!
I dropped the first wave with semi-auto
fire, but they just kept coming.
Sheer luck, most of them
were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran them down.
Ones that got on board, I handled
with a combination of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand
techniques.
I am completely
out of ammo.
That's never
happened to me before.
Shit!
Who cares, Burt?
Sounds like you
killed them all, huh?
I hope not. These creatures
are very important.
You know,
I mean scientifically.
That fact was
not lost on me.
When it was all over, I saw one of
the little SOBs was just stunned.
So I detained him.
Oh, man,
it's drooling.
Don't let him
spook you.
That line is
1,000-pound test.
Go on.
Haul him out of there.
Hold on to
that son of a bitch!
I'll get the door.
I knew it. Infrared.
It doesn't hear us, it
doesn't actually see us.
It senses the heat
of our bodies.
See that? The thing that rises
up must be the heat sensor.
You feel that? Gives off a
lot of heat when it screams.
That's it.
I bet that's the way
they communicate.
The sound doesn't matter.
I mean, they make noise,
but they signal each
other with their body heat.
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not
so weird.
A rattlesnake strikes
at body heat.
That's why they
tore up the cars,
because the engines were
hot. They thought it was food.
Same thing
with the radio tower.
That electronic gear puts
off all kinds of heat.
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.
You mean, they've been acting so
smart because they're so stupid?
Now, that's not warm. How
does he know to eat that?
It tastes it
with its tongue.
See how he's dragging
his tongue all over?
If he touches
anything he likes,
he eats it.
How much can it eat? Those
MREs aren't cheap, you know.
Looks like
he's had enough.
You're feeding it too
much! You made it sick.
Give me a break. Probably
your nasty food made it sick.
Oh, good God!
Hermaphrodites.
They reproduce
without having sex.
I claim
the little one.
Hey, wait a minute.
It was my food!
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just...
And there's another one.
And then one makes two,
two makes four,
four makes eight.
It's exponential.
Well, hell. That gives
them quite an edge.
You never see this in higher
animals. Ever! It's astounding.
Don't you guys get it?
Oh, we get it.
We just don't want it.
I think the little one's
getting big already.
I think we better
think about leaving.
These guys have taken a completely
different evolutionary path.
They got into your
damn super-food, Burt!
Let's go. Come on.
The warehouse! We'd
better close the warehouse!
This way!
Grady! No!
No! Not that way!
Grady!
Grady! Damn it!
All right!
This isn't
gonna work.
Shit!
They stopped.
They're just
milling around.
Looks like they
lost track of us.
Yeah, but that's not going to last.
We're like
sitting ducks here!
Well, I'm sorry. It looked
like a goddamn building to me!
Well, why didn't
you listen to me?
Come on. These little
snappers are blind and deaf.
We've got to be able
to beat them.
I told you,
they can't see us.
Great.
Now what?
Now move with me.
Move?
It's gonna work,
damn it. Now move!
And step, and step,
and step.
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.
I think on my feet.
Come on! It's working.
Coming at you.
Okay. All right.
And down.
So,
where are we going?
Are there
any more cars left?
Yeah. One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.
Which way?
Left. Move left.
Okay. Ready
and moving left.
And step, and step,
and step, and step,
and step.
Okay, it's not
much further.
Oh!
God damn it! There's one
of them out there! Shit.
Did it see you?
I don't know.
Well, if it had, I think we'd
be hearing about it by now.
How far is it?
Hundred yards, about.
That's
a heck of a shot.
Mmm-hmm.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You only got one shot?
Then you've got
to hit it, man.
Before it sends one of those
heat signals to the others.
I know.
Cover your ears.
Jesus.
You smoked his ass.
Doing what I can
with what I got.
Good.
Holy shit, Burt.
Oh, no. Pop the hood.
I got it. I got it.
Damn!
We're dead.
What?
I didn't know.
How could I have known?
We're supposed to be
up against graboids.
I wanted
maximum penetration.
Well, you've got it.
Now what?
We can't stay here.
We've got to get inside.
Cantina!
Damn!
Burt?
Uh-oh.
Burt!
Oh, no! Burt!
No! Burt! It's working. They
can't find you. Don't move.
Good! Good idea.
Now, this is pathetic!
Wait a minute! I've got a plan, I think!
Earl. Earl!
Yeah, I know. I know. I
just need another second.
Oh! Oh! Shit!
Oh!
That's great!
Here.
Here, here.
Get ready to run.
We're going to head for
those oil towers and climb.
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.
Go.
You're okay.
They can't climb.
Watch your step.
Oh, God. Oh, man.
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.
Slick? Man,
that was brilliant.
God, you really do think
on your feet, don't you?
Yeah, well...
Hey, where's Burt?
Oh. Over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.
Oh, man.
I think he's going
to be okay for now.
Oh, I'm just dandy!
So what do we do now?
Hey, Burt.
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check
all your pockets?
You know,
as I lie here,
I can't help but comment.
The reason I'm out of
nine millimeter rounds
is I was not
properly briefed.
And the reason for that is this
mission was not properly researched.
If certain people
had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures
before bumbling
into the situation...
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.
...when we
should've been packing
full-auto,
preferably belt-fed!
Shut up!
They're Precambrian
life-forms, Burt.
How's anybody supposed to
research Precambrian life-forms?
What difference
does it make now?
We're stuck
on a goddamn roof
with a bunch of whatsits
trying to eat us.
I mean, I've done this
before and I did not like it.
Oh. Oh, okay.
Now it's all my fault!
So, things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!
Please! Would you
just all relax?
Now, look. Nobody's heard
from us since last night.
Which means that pretty soon they're
going to be up here looking for us, right?
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?
Burt!
Okay.
So I figured I wanted
to learn some Spanish
and six months in Mexico would
be an adventure, you know.
So, uh...
Seeing anybody?
Not since
the monsters arrived.
Well, you know.
You spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start thinking
about your future and...
Thinking you should
date more?
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.
Look.
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool,
you know, in a situation like this.
What I mean is that, um,
all that matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.
It's more important
than what she looks like.
Thanks a lot.
Oh, come on.
You look great.
Enough guys have
told you that, huh?
Yeah, well.
Believe it or not,
I made my living
as a model
once upon a time.
I put myself
through college.
I believe it.
I was a...
I was even
a playmate once.
About gave my dad
a heart attack.
What?
October, '74?
Shit!
Yup.
Guys. Guys!
Oh, my God.
Look at that.
Goddamn
little heat-seekers.
What do
we do, Earl?
You gotta stop asking
me that! I don't know!
What's going on?
What's happening?
Uh-oh.
Smart little bastards.
Whoa.
Come get me, you suckers! You
hungry? 185 pounds of lean meat.
What are you doing?
You know you want it!
Burt!
What is wrong
with him?
Has he got a plan?
Burt's always got a plan,
usually.
Yes!
Problem solved.
Nice going,
you maniac!
Whoo!
Burt, you did it!
You tricked
the little plug uglies!
How's it feel
to be so stupid?
Whoo!
Oh, Christ! Did they
find something to eat?
What's in there, Kate?
I don't know,
boxes and supplies.
Sweet! Golosinas. I
know this one. Snack.
Sweet snack food?
Sweet snack food?
Rice flour.
I didn't know! How could I have known?
God, don't they ever
get tired of eating?
There will be
a hundred of them.
Okay, we're going
to run for it!
What?
Where?
We're not going
to make it!
Look! Earl, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I got
you all into this.
Come on, Grady.
We ain't dead yet.
Okay! Come on.
Okay, what?
What, okay?
I've got a plan!
Sort of.
You're going to
squirt me with this.
That's great! CO2,
it'll make you cold.
Right. They won't see me.
Says who?
No, no, no, they're
right. It ought to work.
For how long?
We've got to
try something!
But what is
the point?
Look, if I can just get to your
truck, I can grab some bombs.
Earl, this is nuts!
Well, yeah, and...
Let me do it!
Don't be stupid.
It was my idea!
No, I got you all
into this.
It's my fault. I'm going in. Spray me.
We got to do it before they
break out. Now, blast me!
Oh, Jesus!
Yes!
No! Rock rips
through paper.
Huh?
I go!
Give me that shirt. I need the
gloves too. This stuff is cold.
You ready? Here goes.
Man, this stuff
is cold!
Okay, here goes.
Lock this door behind me. Lock it?
Yeah. I'll get the bombs
and go out the other door.
All right.
Sounds like
it's working.
I can't see anything.
Over here.
Come here!
Holy tamole!
There's dozens of them.
Good Lord.
Wait a minute!
Paper wraps rock,
doesn't it?
Paper always
wraps rock.
Damn!
He's starting to melt!
Earl, you're melting! Step
on it! Come on! Go! Go! Go!
Damn! They see him.
Rope! All right, we
need rope or something.
Hang on, Earl!
A hose. There's a hose
by the fire hydrant!
Here you go.
It's too short!
Did you hear me?
The hose is too short.
Burt, hurry!
Heads up, Earl!
Grab it! Come on!
Go! Run! Run! Go!
I set a bomb.
What?
It's the only thing
I could think of.
Kate, what
did he do?
Grady?
Come on!
Where the hell are the
bombs? I don't know.
I didn't have time. I just
threw one in your truck.
You what?
That's two-and-a-half tons
of high explosives, Earl!
You saying
that's not enough?
Oh, God, Burt. Don't
tell me it's not enough!
Not enough?
Never mind. Never mind. Just run!
Faster!
No! No, no! Keep going.
It's going to be big. Big!
Is he serious?
Burt knows his bombs.
How big can it be?
How long
did you set it for?
I don't know.
I just pushed it.
God, it's going
to be big. Big!
All right,
this will have to do.
Get down, stay down,
cover your ears.
It's going to be big!
Is it going to
be today?
Grady,
get your ass down!
Hey, Grady! Grady!
Grady,
you all right, man?
You okay?
Yeah. Thanks.
Watch yourselves.
Phew!
Wow.
You know, Grady,
some people think
I'm over-prepared.
Paranoid.
Maybe even
a little crazy.
But they never met any
Precambrian life-forms, did they?
Look, I don't mind hanging
around down here for a while.
Going to have
any free time?
Well, spend a couple days
almost getting killed,
you start thinking
about your future.
Thinking you should
date more?
Well, yeah, actually.
Hey, Earl, I just realized
they owe us for 28 worms, man.
Hey, that's right. That's
right. We didn't die.
Although,
we did kind of blow up their refinery.
Hey, that's just part of the job.
In fact, we ought to charge them
for all those
little ones, too.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, we'll have enough to
start our own theme park.
"Grady and Earl's
Monster World. " Huh?
Hey. No way!
Come on, Earl.
This could be like
your big, third chance.
