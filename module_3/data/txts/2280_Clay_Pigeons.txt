WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
AMANDA!
AMANDA?
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW, WHY WOULD SHE SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
WHAT?
I WANT TO KNOW.
I DON'T THINK THAT MATTERS
RIGHT NOW, CLAY.
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE
SHE TOLD YOU, MAN.
WELL, SHE DID!
IN GREAT DETAIL,
MR. LIKE-TO-DO-IT-FROM-BEHIND.
YO, EARL,

YOU CAN'T KILL A DEER,
SO JUST...
PUT THE GUN DOWN.

PUT IT DOWN.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE FACT IS...
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME.
NOW I'M
A LITTLE CONFUSED.
I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT IT, CLAY!
EVER SINCE SHE TOLD ME!
SHE WAS A VIRGIN
WHEN WE WAS MARRIED.
[SCOFFS] I REMEMBER HER
BEING A LITTLE WILD
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
YOU'RE STRAYIN'!

OH, YEAH, CRAZY?
CRAZY ENOUGH TO TELL PEOPLE

CRAZY ENOUGH TO TELL
AMANDA THAT ME AND YOU
WAS GONNA HAVE IT OUT
OVER THIS HERE VERY ISSUE?
CRAZY ENOUGH TO BRING BOTH
OF THE TRUCKS UP HERE?
'CAUSE IT'LL BE ONE THING
TO HIDE MY BODY.
IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER THING
GETTIN' BOTH THESE
TRUCKS OUT OF HERE.
I THOUGHT IT ALL OUT,
CLAY.

SEEMS TO BE TAKING IT WELL.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
YOU SHOULD SEE HER.
SHE WALKS AROUND TOWN

I JUST SUPPOSE...
DIFFERENT PEOPLE
HANDLE THINGS
IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
THANKS.
I DON'T LIKE TO
TALK BAD ABOUT PEOPLE,
BUT I JUST NEVER UNDERSTOOD
HOW EARL COULD HAVE MARRIED
A BITCH LIKE THAT.
DIDN'T ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU
ABOUT PERSONAL SPACE?
WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER
MY CALLS, CLAY, HMM?
PEOPLE NEED A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF ROOM TO FEEL COMFORTABLE.
IT'S BEEN 2 WEEKS, BABY,
2 WEEKS, AND THAT'S
JUST TOO LONG.
I HEARD IN OTHER COUNTRIES
PEOPLE DON'T NEED SO MUCH SPACE.
WILL YOU SHUT UP
FOR A SECOND, HMM?
THAT MAY BE OK--
I SAID SHUT UP, CLAY.

I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
A COUPLE TIMES, CLAY,
BUT THIS HAS GOT TO BE
ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES
IN THE WHOLE STATE
RIGHT HERE.
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS.
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NO DAMN
GOOD FOR FISHING, THOUGH.
THEY QUIT STOCKING IT.
THAT'S WHY NO ONE
COMES HERE ANYMORE.
Except for you and me.
TELL YOU WHAT, I PULLED
A 5-POUND STRIPER
OUTTA HERE LESS
THAN A MONTH AGO.
JUST MAKES IT MORE OF
A CHALLENGE, THAT'S ALL.
PUT A LITTLE MOTION
IN YOUR CAST THERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
WHAT'S THAT?
THE EAR.
OH, THIS HERE?
OH, NOTHIN'. JUST BLEEDS
ONCE IN A WHILE, THAT'S ALL.

WELL, FUCK ME!
MAN OVERBOARD!
OH, MY GOD.
MAN OVERBOARD! ALARM!
WHAT IS THAT?
THAT'S A PERSON, CLAY.
I THINK THAT'S A DEAD PERSON.
I CAN SEE IT'S A
FUCKING DEAD PERSON.
WHAT DO WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS
A NEW SITUATION FOR ME.
BUT I GUESS THE RIGHT THING TO
DO WOULD BE TO BRING IT ASHORE.
NO, WAIT.
WAIT A GODDAMN MINUTE.
NOW, DON'T YOU THINK WE
SHOULD REPORT IT FIRST?
THAT'S STANDARD
PROCEDURE.
YEAH, BUT WE'RE A LONG WAY
FROM A PHONE, MAN.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY
WOULD WANT US TOUCHING HER.
EVIDENCE.
HER?
HER? HER?
I'M NOT EVEN SURE
THAT DAMN THING'S A WOMAN.
OF COURSE IT'S A WOMAN.
IT'S GOT LONG HAIR.
COULD BE A ROCK STAR.
WE DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW
WHAT IT IS, DO WE?
DON'T MAKE IT LIKE I'M DUMB.
OK, BUT I STILL THINK WE
OUGHT TO REPORT IT FIRST.
LISTEN, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.
LET'S SAY WE GO
AND WE GET SOME PEOPLE,
AND THEN WE COME
BACK HERE, RIGHT?
AND THEN WE DON'T
FIND IT AGAIN.
OK.
AND HOW DO YOU PROPOSE
THAT WE BRING IT IN?
LET'S SINK A LINE IN IT.
WE'LL TOW IT IN.
THIS ISN'T
A GODDAMN JOKE.
I'M SERIOUS.
GET YOUR POLE.
IT'S A HUMAN BEING,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
IT'S AWFUL GAMEY.
IT'S NOT RIGHT! YOU
CAN'T PUT A FUCKING--
OK, OK, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!

I LOVE THE OPEN WATER, MAN!
OOH-WEE,

I GREW UP NEXT TO
A SLAUGHTERHOUSE, MAN,
BUT, DAMN, IT NEVER
SMELLED THAT BAD.
NOW WONDER THEM DAMN
FISH WEREN'T BITING.
[LAUGHS]
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
SHOOT.
WELL, SEEMS LIKE WE GOT

THEN ANSWER
A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS.
YEAH?
WELL, I'M DUE IN
BILLINGS THIS AFTERNOON,
AND TRUTH BE TOLD,
I'M NOT IN REAL GOOD
GRACES WITH MY BOSS.
IF I'M LATE AGAIN, ACTUALLY,
I COULD BE OUT OF A JOB.
WE GOTTA REPORT THIS THING.
OH, I KNOW THAT.
I KNOW THAT.
I WAS JUST WONDERING MAYBE
YOU COULD DO IT YOURSELF.
LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.
DO WHAT?
YOU KNOW, JUST SAY YOU
WENT FISHING ALONE MAYBE.
I THINK WE BOTH OUGHT
TO BE THERE, LESTER.
HELL, IT AIN'T LIKE I SAW
ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T SEE.
LOOKIT, YOU WERE FISHING.
BODY WASHES UP.
END OF DEPOSITION.
I DON'T LIKE TAKING CHANCES
WHEN IT COMES TO THE LAW.
YOU'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.
YOU'RE JUST REPORTING
WHAT YOU SAW.
YOU TRUST ME.
[AIR HORN BLOWS]
OHH.
I APPRECIATE IT, CLAY.

MAN PUTS A BODY
IN A LAKE...
THE IDEA IS TO KEEP IT
AT THE BOTTOM.
GIMME ONE OF THOSE.
HOW'S AMANDA HOLDING UP?
DON'T KNOW.
HAVEN'T SEEN HER AROUND
MUCH TO TELL THE TRUTH.
YOU SHOULD CHECK IN ON HER.
SHE ALWAYS LIKED YOU.
I'LL DO THAT.
IS--IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE?
NO. GO HOME.
PROMISE ME SOMETHING,
THOUGH, WILL YA?
WHAT'S THAT?
PROMISE YOU'LL STOP
FINDING DEAD PEOPLE.
Sheriff Mooney:

PERSONAL, MOONEY.
ANSWER THE QUESTION.
[CLEARS THROAT]
AFTER THIS, UH,
WONDERFUL MOVIE,
WE WENT

DID SHE STAY THE NIGHT?
NO.
SHE LEFT AROUND,
UH, 2:00 OR SO.

YOU HEARD FROM HER?
YEAH.
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THAT?
TELL YOU WHAT?
YOU KNEW SHE WAS MISSING,

YEAH. I...
[CLEARS THROAT]

DID YOU GET A VERY
GOOD LOOK AT HER?

7 TIMES.
[SIGHS]
STABBED, HUH?
HI, CLAY.

Amanda:

SO TENDER ??
?? MY HEART

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, HUH?

CUT MYSELF GETTING
THE BOTTLE OPEN.
YOU WANT SOMETHING

NO, DARLING,
IT'S JUST A NICK.

SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM?

HA HA!
WELL, MY MAMA

HERE COMES DADDY

I DON'T THINK THIS IS LEGAL

[MUTTERING]
HEY, I THOUGHT THAT WAS
YOUR TRUCK OUTSIDE.
HEY, HEY. CLAY,
HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
YOU SON OF A BITCH. GOOD.
YOU'RE UP AWFULLY EARLY.
YEAH. GOT TO GET
A LOT OF MILES IN TODAY.
OH, YEAH?
ON THE ROAD AGAIN, HUH?
MM-HMM.
[LAUGHS]
SO, UH, HOW'S AMANDA?
OH, MAN, YOU SURE WERE
RIGHT ABOUT HER.
BOY, SHE WAS A MOUTHY
LITTLE BITCH.
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.
YOU SHOULD'VE HEARD SOME OF
THE THINGS SHE SAID ABOUT YOU.
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?
I DON'T THINK YOU'D
BELIEVE THEM IF I TOLD YOU.
HA HA HA!
UH, KIMBERLY?
KIMBERLY? I'M READY
FOR THE CHECK WHEN YOU ARE.
NO RUSH.
APPRECIATE IT.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
THOUGH.
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.
JUST BETWEEN US.
Kimberly:
THERE YOU GO.
HEY, CLAY.
HI, KIMBERLY.
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD.
WELL, I GUESS YOU TWO
ARE ALREADY
ACQUAINTED THEN, HUH?
HE USED TO BABY-SIT ME
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
HEH HEH.
IS THAT RIGHT?
USED TO BABY-SIT YOU?
THAT'S GREAT.
WELL...
I THINK THIS SHOULD
SETTLE US UP.
YOU KEEP THE CHANGE.
THANKS.
YOU DESERVE IT.
YOU THANK YOURSELF.
THANKYOU.
AND, UM, UM,
COULD I GET
A CUP OF COFFEE?
SURE.
OK, THANKS.
THANK YOU, GIRL.
MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM, MMM.
HEY.
SHE'S JUST A KID.
YEAH.
WHATEVER YOU SAY, MAN.
[LAUGHS]
I WANT TO THANK YOU
AGAIN, CLAY.
OH, YEAH?
FOR WHAT?
THAT THING AT THE LAKE.
USED TO BE FRIENDS WOULD STICK
THEIR NECK OUT FOR EACH OTHER.
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
WELL, IT WAS
NO BIG DEAL.
HELL, IT ISN'T A BIG DEAL.
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, CLAY.
ALL RIGHT.
[SLAPS TABLE]
ENOUGH SAID.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
A LOT OF MILES

[THUNDER]

[SIREN]
[TURNS OFF RADIO]
[SIREN STOPS]
WHAT HAPPENED?
SOMEBODY GOT KILLED.
I'M SORRY, CLAY.
YOU CAN'T COME IN.
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT'S AMANDA.
WHAT?
SOMEBODY CUT HER
ALL TO PIECES, MAN.
OH.

[TIRES SQUEAL]

[DROPLET HITS WATER]
[CAMERA TAKING PICTURES]
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU, DAN.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.
AGENT SHELBY?
HI. ARE YOU
SHERIFF MOONEY?
YEAH.
HOW YOU DOING?
DALE SHELBY, FBI.
THIS IS AGENT REYNARD.
MAY WE SEE THE BODY,
PLEASE?
WHEN WAS SHE DISCOVERED?
UH, A COUPLE HOURS AGO.
A METER MAN SAW HER.
THE METER'S RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE WINDOW.
HAS THE WEAPON
BEEN RECOVERED?
NO.
HEY, SHERIFF.
OH! WHOA! WHOA! WHOA!
YOU'RE STANDING
IN EVIDENCE.
GOD.
HI. UH, THERE'S A REALLY
BIG CROWD OUT THERE.
YOU WANT ME
TO RUN THEM OFF?
JUST KEEP THEM
OFF THE PROPERTY.
OK, BARNEY?
YES, SIR, SHERIFF.
YOUR DEPUTY'S NAME
IS BARNEY?
YEAH.
THAT'S GREAT.
[COUGHS]
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME.
WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?
UH, STATE POLICE,
THE FIRE CHIEF, AND...
A COUPLE OF COUNCILMEN.
WHY IS THE FIRE CHIEF HERE?
WELL, HE'S DONE
SOME POLICE WORK BEFORE.
I THOUGHT
IT COULDN'T HURT.
AND HOW ABOUT THE COUNCILMEN?
WELL, UH...
THEY WANTED TO COME.
YOU KNOW, ORDINARILY I SAY
THE MORE THE MERRIER.
I DO. I SAY IT ALL THE TIME,
BUT A MURDER SCENE IS NOT
REALLY CROWD APPROPRIATE,
SO COULD WE JUST MAKE SURE
THAT NOBODY TOUCHES ANYTHING?
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
ANYBODY SEEN THIS?
NO.
WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE--
HE CLEANED UP
AFTERWARDS.
BINGO.
MM-HMM.
HOW WELL
DID YOU KNOW AMANDA?
PRETTY WELL.
WHAT WAS SHE LIKE?
HONEST.
MEANING?
AMANDA WASN'T THE NICEST
PERSON IN THE WORLD.
Woman on P.A.:
PAGING DR. CROWDER.
DR. CROWDER,
PLEASE PICK UP LINE 364.
I TOLD DR. JAFFE
TO MEET US HERE.
DID YOU CATCH SOMEBODY?
THE WOUNDS WERE ALL MADE
WITH THE SAME KNIFE.
PROBABLY A STANDARD
KITCHEN KNIFE.
THE FATAL BLOW ENTERED
JUST BELOW
THE SHOULDER BLADE,
WHERE IT PIERCED HER
HEART AND HER LEFT LUNG.
HOW LONG HAS HER HUSBAND
BEEN DEAD?
OH, ABOUT A MONTH.
HAS SHE BEEN SEEING ANYONE
SINCE THAT TIME?
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.
EXCUSE ME.
ANY SIGNS
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT?
NO, BUT SHE DID
HAVE INTERCOURSE
WITHIN 2 HOURS
OF HER DEATH.
HOW MANY OF THE WOUNDS
WERE POSTMORTEM?
ALMOST ALL OF THEM.
I COUNTED MORE THAN 40
POINTS OF ENTRY IN ALL.
LET ME SHOW YOU.
Kane: THE FIRST THING
THAT I'M GOING TO DO
WHEN I GET BACK IS
TO GET SOME DECENT FOOD.
Parker: I CAN DIG IT. I'VE BEEN
EATING VIRTUAL MYSTERY MEAT.
BUT THEN I'VE TASTED BETTER.
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
COCONUTS, PINEAPPLES.
YOU POUND DOWN THE STUFF
LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW.
[LAUGHING]
Kane:
YOU SHOULD KNOW.
YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S MADE OF.
Parker: I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT IT'S MADE OF.
I'M EATING THIS.
[BED VIBRATING
AND SQUEAKING LOUDLY]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
SMALL CHEESE
AND BROCCOLI.
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?
UH, 7.50.
[MAN SCREAMING ON TELEVISION]
WHATEVER
FLOATS YOUR BOAT.
KEEP IT.
OH, THANKS.
[SCREAMING ON TELEVISION
CONTINUES]
Lambert: OH, GOD!
[WOMAN MOANING]
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]
WHY DON'T YOU START
BY DESCRIBING YOUR
RELATIONSHIP WITH AMANDA?
WE WERE FRIENDS.
NOTHING MORE?
NO.
DO YOU LIKE MOVIES,
CLAY?
AND CAN I CALL YOU CLAY?
SURE.
SURE, YOU LIKE MOVIES,
OR SURE,
I CAN CALL YOU CLAY?
SURE, YOU CAN CALL ME CLAY,
AND I LIKE MOVIES.
I MEAN, YOU GOT TO, LIVING
IN A TOWN LIKE THIS, RIGHT?
AMANDA WAS QUITE A FAN,
TOO. DID YOU KNOW THAT?
NO, I DIDN'T.
SHE HAD A VERY EXTENSIVE
VIDEO COLLECTION.
MOST OF THE STUFF
WAS NOT REALLY MY TASTE.
LOW-BROW COMEDIES,
ACTION JUNK,
THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
BUT I WAS VERY BORED
IN MY MOTEL ROOM,
SO I DECIDED TO BORROW
ONE OF HER VIDEOS.
YOU EVER SEENALIEN?
I THINK SO, A LONG TIME AGO.
IT'S A GREAT FLICK.
VERY EMPOWERING,
ALTHOUGH SMALL SCREEN,
SHITTY DUB
IS NOT REALLY THE WAY
TO EXPERIENCE IT.
I WAS JUST WATCHING IT
AND MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS,
AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED.
Shelby: LET'S FIND OUT.
AAH!
[SCREAMING]
Lambert: OH, GOD!
SO YOU'RE A FULL-SERVICE
GARAGE, EH?
THAT WAS REALLY IMPRESSIVE,
MR. De MILLE.
WHEN DID YOU SHOOT THAT?
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.
SHE SAID SHE WAS GONNA
RECORD OVER IT,
BUT I GUESS SHE DIDN'T.
NO.
[SIGHS]
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOU TWO?
WE WERE HAVING
AN AFFAIR, MOONEY.
THAT'S NOT THE KIND
OF THING YOU TALK ABOUT.
[SIGHS]
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT CAROL PIERCE?
WHO'S CAROL PIERCE?
THE WOMAN WHOSE BODY YOU FOUND
FLOATING IN BEAR LAKE.
I'VE NEVER HEARD
THE NAME BEFORE.
SHE'D BEEN MISSING
ABOUT 2, 2 1/2 MONTHS.
SHE WAS LAST SEEN
IN THE GREAT FALLS AREA.
DO YOU EVER GET UP THERE
FOR ANY REASON?
GREAT FALLS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
MOONEY, WHAT'S
SHE TRYING TO DO?
I'M TRYING TO TELL
YOU SOMETHING.
SHE WAS STABBED
JUST LIKE AMANDA,
AND JUST LIKE 7 OTHER WOMEN
THAT HAVE TURNED UP DEAD IN THIS
STATE OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS.
WE'VE ALSO GOT
5 WOMEN MISSING,
INCLUDING GLORIA COLLINS,
SO WHY DON'T YOU QUIT
DICKING AROUND,
AND TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?
THIS IS CRAZY.
THIS IS REALLY
FUCKING CRAZY.
MOONEY, TELL HER
THAT THIS IS CRAZY.
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
TO BE SEEN WITH HER.
I'M NOT ANSWERING
ANY MORE QUESTIONS.
YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT'S A BIG COINCIDENCE.
WHAT?
YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH ONE VICTIM,
YOU'RE DATING ANOTHER,
AND YOU ACTUALLY FOUND
A THIRD.
COME ON.
WE'RE A LITTLE CURIOUS.
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT
TALKING ANYMORE.
ALL RIGHT, MOONEY,
I WANT A LAWYER.
YOU DON'T NEED
A LAWYER, CLAY.
YOU'RE NOT BEING
CHARGED WITH ANYTHING.
BUT I DO THINK
YOU CAN HELP US.
THERE'S BOUND
TO BE SOMETHING
YOU SAW OR HEARD
THAT MIGHT LEAD US
TO THE KILLER.
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
GO ON HOME
AND THINK ABOUT IT?
MAYBE YOU'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING
IF ANYTHING
COMES TO YOU,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.
HEY, MOONEY.
DO ME A FAVOR.
YOU MAKE SURE THAT TAPE
DOESN'T GET OUT, OK?
YOU'VE GOT MY WORD.
HE'S NOT YOUR MAN.
WHY?
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.
WHY WOULD HE LEAD US
TO ONE OF THE BODIES?
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT RATIONAL THOUGHT HERE.
SOMETIMES PEOPLE
WANT TO BE CAUGHT.
SOMETIMES THEY'RE
CRYING OUT FOR HELP.
SOMETIMES THEY PUSH
THE ENVELOPES, THEY TAUNT US.
NO.
CLAY IS A NICE GUY.
THEY'RE ALL NICE GUYS.
[RING]
HELLO.
Lester: HEY, BUDDY.
LESTER.
YEAH,
ONE AND THE SAME.
LISTEN, CLAY.
I THINK ME AND YOU
SHOULD GET TOGETHER.
HELLO.
ARE YOU THERE?
CLAYBORNE.
HA HA HA.
YEAH, I'M HERE.
LISTEN, I'M GONNA BE
UP YOUR WAY
LATER ON TONIGHT,
SO WHERE'S A PLACE
ME AND YOU CAN MEET?
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
COMFORTABLE.
UM...
WHAT ABOUT DOC HOLIDAY'S?
OH, NOW, I DON'T
THINK SO, CLAY.
[LAUGHS]
I DON'T THINK
ME AND YOU
SHOULD BE SEEN
TOGETHER.
DO YOU?
HEY, CLAY.
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D SHOW.
JUST HAD TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU WEREN'T
FOLLOWED, MY MAN.
HA.
BOY, DON'T THIS
BRING BACK MEMORIES?
WHY? WHY?
DON'T GET ALL
RILED UP ON ME NOW!
DON'T GET ALL RILED
UP ON ME NOW, BOY!
SON, TAKE IT SLOW.
TAKE IT SLOW.
TAKE YOUR ASS SLOW,
BOY. I TOLD YOU NOW.
PLAY NICE WITH YOUR
BIG DADDY HERE.
WHY?
WHY?!
I WAS DOING YOU
A GODDAMN FAVOR.
I NEVER ASKED YOU
TO FUCKING KILL HER!
WELL, YOU'RE NOT SORRY
SHE'S GONE, ARE YOU?
THEY THINK I DID IT.
NO, THEY DON'T.
THEY THINK I DID
ALL OF 'EM.
THEY DON'T HAVE
NOTHING ON YOU.
IT'LL ALL BLOW OVER
IN A WEEK.
JESUS CHRIST.
BRING DOWN
THE TEMPERATURE
A LITTLE BIT.
IT WON'T TAKE THAT LONG
IF I TELL THEM ABOUT YOU.
BUT YOU WON'T DO THAT.
YEAH, WHY NOT?
WELL, YOU ALREADY
HAD YOUR CHANCE, CLAY...
BUT YOU DIDN'T DO IT,
DID YOU?
I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT
OLD AMANDA TOLD ME.
[LAUGHING]
I MEAN, HERE YOU GOT
2 GUYS FISHING...
AND THEN OUT OF
THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE,
ALL OF A SUDDEN
A BODY WASHES UP.
THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF
THING YOU SEE EVERY DAY.
BUT YET, NEITHER OF US
SEEMED ALL THAT
SURPRISED BY IT, MAN.
YOU KNOW, WHAT
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
IS HOW COME AFTER
YOU DROPPED ME OFF
YOU DIDN'T JUST
COME BACK HERE
AND THROW HER ASS
RIGHT BACK IN THE LAKE.
NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN.
I DIDN'T KILL HER.
I BELIEVE YOU.
I SAID IT.
I BELIEVE YOU.
I BELIEVE YOU, CLAY,
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT
ANYBODY ELSE WOULD.
HOW MANY HAVE THERE BEEN?
OH, COME ON NOW, CLAY.
LET'S NOT GET
INTO THAT SHIT.
I WANT TO KNOW.
[SPLASH]
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING
TO PLAY DETECTIVE
OR ANYTHING WITH ME,
WOULD YOU?
YOU KNOW IF I GO DOWN,
YOU GO WITH ME.
SO WHY NOT TELL ME?
WELL, THERE'S A FEW
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT.
BUT THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT IS, CLAY.
SOME PEOPLE
CAN JUST, UH...
DISAPPEAR.
NOBODY MISSES 'EM.
WHAT, MAMA LESTER
DIDN'T LOVE YOU?
DON'T LOWER YOURSELF.
DON'T LOWER IT!
DON'T LOWER YOURSELF!
SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE
THE LAST PERSON
IN THE GODDAMN WORLD
THAT SHOULD BE ASKING ME
A FUCKING QUESTION
LIKE THAT.
I SAW YOU
THAT NIGHT, CLAY.
UH-HUH.
I SAW THE WAY YOU
HANDLED HER LIKE THAT.
WHAT, BECAUSE
I SLAPPED AMANDA?
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT HER.
SURE YOU DID.
WHO KNOWS, CLAY?
WHO KNOWS?
IF THERE HADN'T BEEN
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE
AROUND YOU THERE.
YOU MIGHT
NOT HAVE STOPPED
JUST WITH A LITTLE
OLD WHACKY.
YOU'RE FUCKED.
AM I?
IT'S ALL
VERY SIMPLE, CLAY.
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
OUT THERE
THAT NEED--NEED KILLING.
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD HAVE
HEARD SOME OF THE SHIT
THAT SHE WAS SAYING AFTER.
YOU KNOW, SHE EVEN TRIED
TELLING ME THAT, UH...
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HER HUSBAND DYING.
NOW, CAN YOU FUCKING
BELIEVE THAT ONE?
THAT LITTLE BITCH GOT ME
SO FUCKING PISSED OFF, MAN!
THAT'S WHY I LOST
FUCKING CONTROL WITH HER!
THAT'S WHY I MADE SUCH
A GODDAMN FUCKING MESS!
USUALLY I'M PRETTY CLEAN
ABOUT IT ALL.
BUT, UH...
AW, HELL.
THAT'S ALL OVER WITH NOW.
IT ISN'T FOR ME.
PATIENCE, BUDDY.
CAN YOU TRY THAT?
THE BIG "P" WORD, PATIENCE.
HELL, CLAY, I DON'T
BLAME YOU FOR BEING SORE.
FUCK, MAN.
I PUT YOU IN A SPOT,
AND I KNOW IT.
ONE OF THESE DAYS, CLAY...
YOU'RE GONNA LOOK BACK.
YOU'RE GONNA REALIZE
I DID THE WORLD
A GREAT SERVICE THAT NIGHT.
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.
[THUNDER]
Mark: HE DID SEEM
A LITTLE NERVOUS
THE OTHER DAY
WHEN HE CAME IN.
Shelby: ALL RIGHT.
OK. WELL, THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
HEY, CLAY.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]
[KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK]
[COUGHS]
HI.
GET DRESSED.
BARNEY.
COULD YOU NOT...
POKE THE BODY
WITH A STICK, PLEASE?
I WAS JUST SEEIN'
SOMETHIN'.
THANK YOU.
IT'S TIME
WE DRAGGED THE LAKE.
YEAH.
MOONEY.
CLAY.
I'M MISSING WORK,
YOU KNOW.
YEAH. WELL,
THIS WON'T TAKE LONG.
Shelby:
WOMAN'S BODY FOUND FLOATING.
Shelby: WE'VE ALSO
GOT 5 WOMEN MISSING.
Lester:
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE
OUT THERE THAT NEED--
NEED KILLING.
Mooney: CLAY.
RIGHT IN HERE.
DISGUSTING SMELL,
ISN'T IT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
GLORIA COLLINS
ISN'T MISSING ANYMORE.
HIS NAME IS LESTER LONG.
I MET HIM OVER AT DOC HOLIDAY'S
A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.
I KNOW HE'S A TRUCK DRIVER.
HE WORKS FOR A COMPANY,
SCANLON SOMETHING.
SCANLON VAN LINES.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
Shelby: LOCATION?
I DON'T KNOW.
SO WHY DO YOU THINK
HE KILLED HER?
HE THOUGHT HE WAS
DOING ME A FAVOR.
A FAVOR?
APPARENTLY HE'S GOT
A REAL DIM VIEW OF WOMEN.
WELL, HELL,
WHO DOESN'T AROUND HERE.
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU
WAIT SO LONG TO TELL US?
WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET HIM.
HEY.
QUIT.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
JUST TRYING TO MAKE
AN HONEST LIVING.
ANY MESSAGES HERE?
WHO'D WANT
TO TALK TO YOU?
THERE WAS SOMEONE
CALLING
FOR THAT LESTER LONG
FELLA, THOUGH.
OH, YEAH?
DID THEY, UH...
SAY WHO IT WAS?
SAID SHE WAS
FROM THE FBI.
THEY GOT WOMEN
WORKING THERE NOW?
WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?
I TOLD HER THERE WAS NO
LESTER LONG WORKING HERE.
I DID RIGHT,
DIDN'T I, BOBBY?
MMM.
SURE DID.
WHERE'S MY SUGAR, DARLIN'?
THANK YOU.
WHO IS THAT
LESTER LONG ANYHOW?
WELL, I AM...
SWEETIE PIE.
[DOOR OPENS]
HI. THIS IS A WARRANT
AUTHORIZING A SEARCH
OF THESE PREMISES.
[BASEBALL GAME ON TV]
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.
I TOLD YOU WHERE
YOU COULD FIND HIM.
WE CALLED SCANLON VAN LINES.
THERE'S NO LESTER LONG
WORKING THERE.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MAYBE THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE SCANLON VAN LINES?
MM-HMM.
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
ALL OUR OPTIONS.
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE
THERE'S A BIG TRUCK
WITH "SCANLON VAN LINES"
WRITTEN
RIGHT ON THE SIDE.
I JUST FIGURED
WITH ALL THE POLICE
AND FBI YOU MIGHT...
TV sportscaster: HERE'S
A SMASH TO THE SHORTSTOP.
MAKES A GREAT PLAY...
Reynard: WOULD YOU COME
IN HERE, SIR?
WHAT?
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
THE FLOORBOARDS
ARE COMING UP.
YEAH, THE PIECE OF SHIT
WATERBED BROKE.
THAT HAPPENED TO ME
ONE TIME.
WHAT A MESS.
NO KIDDING.
YOU KNOW...
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE
YOU THINK I DID IT.
WHY NOT?
WELL...
I'M NO FBI
OR ANYTHING, BUT...
YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
THIS GUY FOR A LONG TIME.
I THINK YOU'RE PRETTY
OBSESSED BY HIM BY NOW.
IF YOU THOUGHT I DID IT,
I THINK I COULD TELL.
I'M NOT OBSESSED,
NOR AM I THAT EASY TO READ.
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WITH THE FBI?
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
IT'S A PRETTY SMALL
PIECE OF INFORMATION,
CONSIDERING
THAT RIGHT NOW
YOU'RE SEARCHING THROUGH
EVERYTHING I OWN.
FAIR ENOUGH.
12 YEARS.
12 YEARS. WOW.
SO THAT WOULD
MAKE YOU WHAT?
VERY GOOD AT WHAT I DO,
AND 32 YEARS YOUNG.
32.
THAT'S A GREAT AGE...
I WOULD IMAGINE.
JUST TRYING TO MAKE
A LITTLE CONVERSATION.
I APPRECIATE THAT, I DO,
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARY,
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO FINISH
WATCHING YOUR SPORTING EVENT?
BASEBALL.
BASEBALL.
Reynard: IN HERE!
[CELL DOOR SLAMS]
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
[SIGNAL BELL CLANGING]
Mooney: YOU'RE UP EARLY.
Shelby: YUP.
ANY NEWS?
I SENT HIS MUG SHOT
OUT LAST NIGHT.
WE'LL SEE IF ANYBODY
RECOGNIZES HIM.
TELL ME SOMETHING.
IS HE LIKE YOU PICTURED?
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I PICTURED,
BUT NO, HE'S NOT.
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?
IT ALL BOTHERS ME.
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS]
[KEYS JINGLE]
[DOOR UNLOCKS]
[DOOR OPENS]
CHOW TIME.
NOT HUNGRY.
WELL, I HEARD THAT,
BUT YOU GOTTA EAT
SOMETHING, BOY.
ANY LUCK FINDING HIM,
MOONEY?
NO.
WELL, KEEP TRYING,
WON'T YOU, MOONEY?
OH, HELL, YOU KNOW I WILL.
IF YOU GET HUNGRY LATER,
TELL BARNEY.
HE'LL HEAT IT UP FOR YOU.
[DOOR OPENS]
[DOOR CLOSES]
[DOOR LOCKS]
MORNING, GLORY.
Lester: HOW ARE YOU?
WHERE'S BARNEY?
OH, YOU MEAN
SLEEPING BEAUTY?
[LAUGHS]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WELL, YOU'RE A FRIEND
OF MINE, CLAY.
YOU KNOW LESTER LONG
WOULD NEVER FORGET A FRIEND.
THAT'S NOT YOUR NAME.
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT IS NOT MY NAME,
BUT, BROTHER, I'VE ALWAYS
LIKED THE SOUND OF IT.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
SO HOW ARE THEY TREATING YOU?
YOU DOING OK BACK THERE?
WELL, I'M CHARGED
WITH MURDER.
ONLY ONE COUNT.
DON'T BE SUCH A FUCKIN' PUSSY
ALL THE TIME, PLEASE.
YOU WANT A CIGARETTE?
I GOT SMOKES.
COME ON.
THAT'S IT.
SO, GOT YOURSELF A LAWYER?
NOPE.
DON'T WORRY, BROTHER.
YOU AIN'T GONNA NEED
A FUCKIN' LAWYER.
I'LL SEE TO THAT.
OH, YEAH. YOU'VE BEEN
GOOD TO ME SO FAR.
DON'T START WITH ME, CLAY.
YOU SET ME UP.
YOU SET YOURSELF UP,
GODDAMN IT!
YOU CROSSED THE LINE
WITH ME, BOY.
WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD I BE
IF I LET SOMETHING LIKE THAT GO?
THAT'S BEHIND US.
THE THING WE GOTTA
THINK ABOUT NOW
IS GETTING YOU OUT OF THERE.
YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?
I'M NOT GONNA TRY
TO ESCAPE.
OH, I KNOW THAT,
YOU LITTLE FUCKIN' CUNT.
DID I SAY THAT TO YOU?
DID I SAY YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO TRY TO ESCAPE?
I GOT SOMETHING ELSE
IN MIND FOR YOU, CLAY.
NOW, LET'S FACE IT.
THEY ALL THINK YOU KILLED
A LOT OF WOMEN.
AND I THINK THE ONLY WAY
THEY'RE GONNA STOP THINKING THAT
IS IF THEY KNOW--IF THEY KNOW...
THAT THE MAN
THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR
IS STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
STILL OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.
HEY.
UH, YOU WOULDN'T
HAPPEN TO HAVE
THAT KIMBERLY'S NUMBER
ON YOU, WOULD YOU?
YOU LEAVE HER OUT
OF THIS, GODDAMN IT.
MAN, WHAT THE FUCK
AM I SAYING?
YOU KNOW, SHE ALREADY
GAVE IT TO ME. WE'RE GOOD.
DON'T FUCKING DO THIS.
I AM NOT GONNA LET YOU SPEND
YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN JAIL.
YOU LEAVE HER
OUT OF THIS.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, GOTTA RUN.
LESTER.
TRAINS ARE LEAVING
THE STATION.
YOU FUCKING
LISTEN TO ME.
HEY, LISTEN, MAN.
I AM SORRY THAT YOU GOTTA SPEND
THE NIGHT HERE IN JAIL,
BUT ALL THIS IS GONNA BE
OVER WITH SOON ENOUGH.
A COUPLE MONTHS FROM NOW,
AFTER EVERYTHING DIES DOWN,
COOLS OFF A LITTLE BIT,
MAYBE YOU AND OLD L.L. HERE
CAN GET TOGETHER.
FUCK THAT.
MAYBE GO FISHING.
DON'T DO THIS.
DON'T YOU GET SASSY,
GODDAMN IT.
[LAUGHS]
YOU ARE A WILD ONE.
ADIOS, AMIGO.
DON'T GO. LISTEN.
LESTER.
LESTER,

SHOWTIME.
PLEASE, LESTER.
LESTER, COME ON!

[COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING]
EXCUSE ME.

THANK YOU.
OH, I GOT IT.

I'M LIKE A BIG
FIREWORKS SHOW.
VERY BRIGHT.
LIKE LITE-BRITE.
