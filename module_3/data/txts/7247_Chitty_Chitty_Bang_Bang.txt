Hang on,
we're coming to a bend.
You're going too fast!
No, l'm not. Hang on !
What's this heap of
old iron doing here?
Old iron?
l'll give you
10 bob for it.
Don't be daft.
This was once
a great car.
Won the Grand Prix
three years running.
So it's a car, is it?
Certainly
it's a car.
lt's a racing car.
And we're winning.
And you're
in the way.
And you're in the way for a
right belt around the ear, young man,
if l have any
more of your lip.
All right. l'll give you
15 bob for it.
Make it 30 bob,
and she's yours.
Mr. Coggins, you're not going to
sell her, are you?
Of course he's
gonna sell her.
What do you think
he's running here,
a children's playground
or something?
All right, 30 bob.
l'll pick her up Wednesday.
But, Mr. Coggins, you promised we
could play in her.
Well, l'm sorry, my dears,
but she ain't any use to me.
Times are hard.
But you can't
take her away.
She's not just any old car.
She's ours.
Not anymore, she ain't.
l'll see you tomorrow, Bill.
Giddy-up!
What're you going
to do with her?
l'll tell you what
we're gonna do with her,
we're gonna put her
in the clapper
and we're gonna crunch her up till
she's one solid piece of metal.
Then we're gonna put her
in a fiery furnace,
and we're gonna melt her down
till she's liquid iron.
That's what we're
gonna do with her.
Now look what you've done.
You've frightened her.
She shivered.
See? She's a very
special car.
lf you put her in the fiery furnace,
you'll be guilty of murder.
Yeah, and if you
don't get out of it,
l'll be guilty of
two more murders.
Now go on, out of it.
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
Please, Mr. Coggins, you can't sell
our lovely car
to that nasty man.
Well, l'm sorry, children,
but l'm afraid l already have.
l know! Daddy will buy it for us.
Won't he, Jemima?
Of course he will.
Mr. Coggins, promise you won't let
her go until we come back.
Well, 30 shillings, mind.
Not a penny less.
Please promise.
Please.
All right, l promise.
Come on, Jemima.
Well, that's
a clever thing to do!
We're very sorry, miss.
l'm sure you are.
Well, just look at my car.
And just look what
a mess l'm in, too.
Oh, no, l think
you're beautiful.
And l like your car.
Hmm.
Just the same, you shouldn't be
rushing across the road like that.
You know, you might
have been killed.
Anyway, why aren't
you in school?
lt isn't a holiday, is it?
No, miss.
Do you live around here?
Yes, we live just
down the road.
Come on, get into my car,
l'm taking you home.
Gosh, just wait till Daddy hears
we've been for a ride in a motorcar!
Yes!
What's your name?
l'm Jemima.
And l'm Jeremy.
What's yours?
Truly.
That's a very
pretty name.
Now, where is your house?
Oh, we don't live
in a house.
We live in the castle
on top of the hill.
A castle? l didn't know there were
any castles around here.
Well, it isn't
a castle exactly.
That's what
Daddy calls it.
He says King Alfred used to live
there hundreds of years ago.
And does your daddy know
you aren't in school?
Oh, he won't mind.
He never does.
Anyway,
he's awfully busy.
ls he?
Well, he'll have to
find time to see me,
because l have
a few things to say to him.
Edison ! Edison !
Come here, boy!
Good boy, good boy.
That's Daddy
over there.
- Hello!
- Hello!
Hello.
You're just in time.
What on earth
is he up to?
That's his latest invention.
Rockets.
Rockets?
Stand back!
Keep clear!
Hooray!
Hooray!
Does he know
what he's doing?
Of course he does.
Whoa!
Well, l don't see
anything funny.
Somebody should do
something about it.
Hold on ! Hold on !
Wait! Wait there.
Oh !
Thank you !
l should hope so.
You might have
gone up in flames.
Madam, l took that
into consideration.
This suit is
completely flameproof.
Oh, dear.
You have just succeeded in ruining
my propulsion unit.
But how was l
to know that you were. . .
Don't be cross
with the lady, Daddy.
She gave us
a ride in her car.
She was only
trying to help.
How very kind.
Her name's Truly.
That's nice.
Do you realize,
Mr. Potts,
that l nearly knocked down
your two children?
Well, we do seem to be accident-prone,
don't we?
But it wasn't my fault. You see,
they came rushing out...
Oh, well, it was very, very nice
of you to apologize.
Apologize?
Tea time, children.
Bye-bye, Truly.
Thanks for the ride.
Just a moment,
you two.
Don't you have something to
tell your father?
Yes, we have. Daddy, Mr. Coggins
promised us...
But she didn't
mean about that.
Daddy, we didn't go
to school today.
Oh-ho.
Well, it'll give the other children
a chance to catch up, won't it?
Run along, children.
Goodbye.
Goodbye. Bye, Truly.
Come on, Edison.
But, Mr. Potts...
Good day!
But, but...
Unstable. Definitely unstable.
Good afternoon, miss.
Sorry l can't stop. l'm off to lndia.
Going to have a cup of tea with
the Maharajah. Cheerio!
Mr. Potts.
l'm sorry to
persist about this,
but perhaps you simply aren't aware
that your children
were running
about in the road.
And after all, you know, it's not
a playground. lt's very...
Would you mind just pressing
that switch there?
Switch?
Yes, just behind you.
On the right.
The right.
The right?
Thank you.
You really ought to try and exercise
more control over them.
Yes, l suppose l could
chain them up, couldn't l?
On a nice long chain,
of course,
so they get
plenty of exercise.
Mr. Potts, don't your children
go to school?
Oh, l have it now.
You're the truant officer.
No, l'm not
the truant officer.
Well, didn't you ever play truant?
l mean, just once?
No, l most
certainly did not.
l bet you didn't.
Would it be too much to ask what
this is, this, um, thing?
A little invention of mine,
cleans carpets by suction.
All that to clean carpets?
Away with sweeping,
and away with brushing,
and away with
dirty carpets.
ls that all you do,
Mr. Potts? lnvent things?
ls that all l do?
And what's this gadget?
Well, that's not
quite right yet,
but eventually, l hope to transmit
moving pictures by wireless.
Oh, really?
Yes, really. That's my...
And this?
This, madam,
is a sweet-making machine.
And is this one
of the sweets?
Yes, it is.
And is it supposed to have
all those holes in it?
No. Actually, l think
that the problem is. . .
The boiling point of
your sugar is too high.
Oh, we're an expert on
sweet-making, are we?
Well,
as a matter of fact...
And an expert
on child welfare.
l was only trying to
help your children.
Well, maybe my children
like running wild in the street.
Did that ever occur to you?
l do not see any cause to...
And in any case,
how my children behave
is frankly
no concern of yours.
l was merely trying...
So, if you'll be so good
as to take yourself off
in that fancy
automobile of yours
and go do good
somewhere else.
Well, l've never been...
Spoken to that way before?
Well, maybe it's about time.
Good afternoon, madam.
Mind the cable!
Vicious, interfering...
lf women are going to drive
motorcars around,
they should learn to
operate one correctly.
Well, l suppose it wouldn't occur
to you to offer to help me.
Get in the car. Please.
Well, for a mechanically-minded man,
Mr. Potts...
Try switching it on.
Oh.
Hmm !
Open the throttle!
And keep it open!
Women!
Confounded woman!
Who does she think she is?
Coming in here and telling me how
to raise my children.
Do l need somebody to tell me how
to raise my children?
Do l? Hmm?
No, of course not.
Of course not!
Where's my cardigan?
Under your jacket.
Under... Yes.
Self-righteous busybody.
She won't be
bothering us again.
But l liked her.
So did l.
She was very pretty.
She certainly was.
Do you think your
father's a crackpot?
Your cardigan's
inside out.
Oh.
Do you think
l'm a lunatic,
wasting my time on a lot
of silly inventions?
But they aren't silly.
They're wonderful.
Nobody else
could think of them.
That's right. That is right.
Nobody else could think of them.
Yes. After all, what makes the battle
worth the fighting?
What makes the mountain
worth the climb?
What makes the questions
worth the asking?
The reason worth
the rhyme?
To me, the answer's clear
lt's having someone near
Someone dear
Someone to care for
To be there for
l have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
l have you two
Someone to share
joy or despair with
Whichever betides you
Life becomes a chore
Unless you're living for
Someone to tend to,
be a friend to
l have you two
Someone to strive for
Do or die for
I have you two
CouId be we three
get along so famously
'Cause you two have me
And I have you two, too
Someone to care for
To be there for
I have you two
Someone to do for
Muddle through for
I have you two
Someone to smiIe
once in a whiIe with
Whenever you're lonesome
I've a happy lot
Considering what I've got
But I couIdn't do more
Than you do for
your poor father
Daddy!
Daddy!
Things go asunder
And I wonder why you bother
Could be we three
Get along so famously 'cause
We two have you
And I have you two
Too
Jeremy.
Oh, good.
Do l smell food?
Bring the bread,
will you, Grandpa.
Yes, sir! Sir! Sir!
And pepper
and salt, please.
Right away, sir!
Oh !
Sausage and egg,
my favorite!
How was lndia?
lndia?
l'll tell you something.
l got up this morning,
and l shot an elephant
in my pajamas. How he ever...
Got into my pajamas,
l shall never know.
You've heard it before.
Now, l wonder how that
could have happened.
Daddy, could we
ask you something?
lt's about Mr. Coggins.
Mr. Coggins.
You see, the junkman
wanted to take it away.
But Mr. Coggins says
if we asked you first. . .
Asked me what first?
He's a horrid,
mean, old man.
Mr. Coggins?
No, the junkman.
He's going to
take it away
and put it in a furnace. And burn
it all up. lt's terrible.
What are you
going on about?
Our car!
Yes, well, what about it?
Mr. Coggins is selling it
to the junkman.
And the junkman's going to put it
in the fiery furnace.
And squidge it all up
till there's nothing left.
Oh, well, that's terrible.
That is terrible.
We can't let
that happen, Grandpa.
No, definitely not.
We knew you
wouldn't let them, Daddy.
So we made Mr. Coggins promise
we could have it
if you gave him
30 shillings.
Uh, 30 shillings.
You can give Mr. Coggins the
money in the morning, Daddy.
Yes, well, l suppose we can
work something out somehow.
Good !
Hooray!
Are you all finished?
Yes, Daddy.
Yes, thank you.
Well, l think, maybe,
you should go run up to bed.
Good night, Grandpa. Good night,
my boy. Sleep tight.
Good night, Grandpa.
Good night, my darling. God bless you.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night.
Good night, Daddy.
Yes, well, you've done it now,
haven't you?
You think Coggins might do a deal?
So much a week?
Coggins? What,
him down the road? Sure.
He's so mean he wouldn't light your
pipe if his house was on fire.
Did you hear that?
You know what that means, don't you?
l'll be up all night, rain pouring
through my bedroom roof.
Grandpa, why don't you sleep in the
workshop? lt's nice and...
The workshop?
You promised, faithfully,
to fix my bedroom roof.
l will, Grandpa.
lt's just...
Caractacus, please.
My boy, listen.
lt's time you woke up. When l was your
age, l did a day's work...
For a day's pay,
polishing the Colonel's boots.
l was the smartest batman
in the British Army.
So you've been
telling me.
When my Brigadier
went into action,
the fuzzy-wuzzies were so blinded
by the shine on his boots,
they couldn't see to fight.
Catch me death of cold.
He doesn't care.
Nobody cares.
Me own son!
She was right.
Who wants sweets with holes in them?
Oh, Edison,
stop that whistling.
Edison, hey,
do that again.
Edison, you're a genius.
The employment office
is in the rear.
Thank you. Oh.
You see, l've invented
these sweets.
Really?
Name?
Uh. . .
Whistling Sweets.
Mr. Whistling Sweets.
Not Mr. Whistling Sweets.
No, l'm Potts.
Hmm.
May l see
the managing director?
Lord Scrumptious sees no one
without an appointment.
Well, how do l
get an appointment?
Why, hello, children.
Jeremy, it's Truly.
Hello, Truly.
Good morning, Miss Scrumptious.
How nice to see you.
Good morning, Phillips.
Please tell my father that l'm here.
But of course,
Miss Scrumptious.
Are you here
on business, Mr. Potts?
Yes, Miss. . .
Father?
Truly Scrumptious.
You're his. . .
His daughter.
Mmm-hmm.
Come on, children,
let's go.
But, Daddy,
you haven't shown
anybody your invention.
Somehow, l don't think
that'll do much good.
Just a moment,
Mr. Potts.
Exactly what was it you...
You've seen them.
Oh, those.
But they whistle.
Whistle?
Those holes.
You just blow through them.
They're very ingenious.
Kind of a novelty.
Please go in,
Miss Scrumptious.
You can come back
in three weeks' time.
Show Mr. Potts in,
Phillips.
Now?
Now.
But his Lordship said...
Now.
Very well.
Please follow me.
Maybe l should come
back in three weeks.
Oh, Daddy!
Go on, Daddy.
All right.
And don't let him
bully you.
Yes.
Mr. Potts, milord.
Potts? Who's he?
Where's me daughter?
She insisted on
Mr. Potts seeing you.
All right, don't just stand there.
What's it all about?
Sweets, sir.
l hardly thought it was nuts and
bolts. Let's have a look.
Yes.
Hurry up, man !
Yes, sir.
lf l may be allowed
to explain, sir.
You have exactly
20 seconds.
Yes.
Well, the fundamental novelty of
these particular sweets
is their musical quality.
Not only are they
remarkably tasty,
but due to the unique positioning
of these little holes,
they are capable,
when blown through,
of rendering
a tuneful whistle.
Place your fingers over the holes
and blow thus.
Tasting time, milord.
Too late. Had your chance.
Muffed it. Good morning.
Go on. Follow him.
Milord?
Sir?
Excuse me.
Sir, if l may be
allowed to demonstrate.
You see, by blowing air through this
hole in the center of the sweet
you get a
wonderful-sounding. . .
Raspberry?
No, no.
lt's more like
a toot, really.
Not enough fruit,
too much sugar.
Yes, milord.
Prepare the peppermint.
Beautiful. Would you
care to try it, sir?
Under no circumstances.
Prepare the lemon!
He's not doing
very well, is he?
You know, another remarkable feature
about these little sweets
is that by sucking on them...
Throw it away!
Will you get rid of
this idiot for me?
Milord. You.
. . .in perfect pitch.
They also come in
strawberry, raspberry...
Are you still here?
...lemon and...
And pineapple.
Go on.
Don't waste your pucker
on some all-day sucker.
And don't try
a toffee or cream.
lf you seek perfection
in sugar confection,
well, there's something
new on the scene.
A mouthful of cheer,
a sweet without peer.
A musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The candies you whistle
The whistles you eat
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The eatabIe,
tweetabIe treats
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The toot of a flute
with the fIavor of fruit
Toot sweets, toot sweets
No longer need candy be mute
Don't waste your pucker
on some all-day sucker
And don't try
a toffee or cream
If you seek perfection
in sugar confection
Well, there's something
new on the scene
That mouthfuI of cheer
That sweet without peer
That musical morsel supreme
That musical morsel supreme
Toot sweets,
toot sweets
A bonbon to blow on
at last has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
With tweetabIe,
eatabIe sound
No! Take it away!
Father, please.
He likes it!
Their value is intrinsic
Surpass any mint stick
Or marshmallow
mouthful you munch
Though licorice is chewy
And gumdrops are gooey
And chocoIate is
charming to crunch
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
It's clearly
the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
That savory fife
That sweet of your life
Is clearly
the best of the bunch
Toot sweets, toot sweets
A bonbon to bIow on
at Iast has been found
Toot sweets, toot sweets
The treat
that's so tweetabIe
Lusciously eatable
With that unbeatabIe
Sound
Get out of here!
Go away!
What's going on?
Get those dogs out of here!
Edison, no!
Edison! Edison!
- Children!
- Edison!
Edison!
lt's entirely your fault.
l'll send for the police.
Daddy.
Now, why aren't
you two asleep?
Don't be sad,
Daddy.
lt wasn't your fault.
lt was all those
mean, old dogs.
Children,
about the car...
You see,
30 shillings is
pretty hard to come by.
And when l do get any money,
l need it for my inventions.
Well, there isn't
any left.
Jeremy and l
have been thinking.
lt's our treasure chest.
These things are
enormously valuable.
Look, an ivory tusk.
That must be
worth a fortune.
And diamonds.
And a golden crown.
lt's probably
King Alfred's.
Of course, it needs
cleaning up a little.
Take them, Daddy.
You can sell them.
And never mind about the car.
You can spend it all on your inventions.
Thank you, children.
All these wonderful things,
they're very precious.
But l'm afraid other people
wouldn't appreciate them.
Why not, Daddy?
Because other people
don't see things the way you do.
Come on, now.
Let's go to bed.
And don't you worry.
Things are going to
come right somehow.
A gentle breeze
from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows
o'er Lullaby Bay
It fiIIs the saiIs
of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
your worries away
It isn't far
to Hushabye Mountain
And your boat
waits down by the quay
The winds of night
so softly are sighing
Soon they will fly
your troubles to sea
So close your eyes
on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye to
cares of the day
And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away
from Lullaby Bay
All the lovely colors.
Two for the price of one.
Get your balloons here!
Hurry, hurry,
hurry along now.
Don't miss these
lovely toffee apples!
Hurry along now!
Get your toffee apples at 8p each.
Thank you very much, young man.
Any more for any more?
Which one of you lovely ladies
and gentlemen
would like a splendid,
automatic haircut?
l've stood in this
marketplace for 25 years.
l do not profess to
make dead men talk!
Hey, now, here you go then.
Who's for an automatic haircut?
Only three pence a time.
You may have long hair,
you may have short hair, sir,
you may have straight hair,
it makes no difference
to the Potts
automatic and hygienic,
electronic
hair-cutting machine!
Come on. You could do
with a haircut.
Cut me hair?
That's where me strength is.
Excuse me, sir, you look like a man
who could do with a haircut.
Bah!
Yeah, go on! Go on.
Come on, sit down.
Hold that, then.
My word,
you have a lot of hair.
Would you like
an estimate, sir?
Very funny.
Go on, get on with it.
You just sit tight, sir, while l
lower this hair-cutting machine.
There we are. You just relax, we'll
have you finished in a bit.
l feel like a real
right nana sitting here.
No, you look lovely, Cyril.
lt's going to be smashing.
You keep your eyes
on that geezer.
Yeah, all right, then.
What's going on?
lt's all right,
Cyril, it's all right.
Nothing to worry about, sir,
a little friction to start.
lt tickles!
Oh, you always
say that, Cyril.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Cyril, you're smoking!
l'm on fire!
Stop it!
Oh!
Excuse me!
Me head's on fire!
lt's all right, sir.
What you done? Give me a mirror.
Let's have a look.
A mirror? l'll go home
and get you one.
Me hair! Look at me hair!
Where is he?
l'll kill him!
There he is, mister!
Cyril!
l'll smash your teeth
down your throat!
You!
Come on, you're too fat
to catch him !
Oi! Big bonce!
Get out of here.
There he is!
Get out of my way!
Oi!
Here, hurry up.
We're on.
Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
A gentleman's got a walking stick,
a seaman's got a gaff
And the merry men of Robin Hood
They used a quarterstaff
On the Spanish plains, inside their
canes, they hide their ruddy swords
But we make do with an old bamboo
And everyone applauds
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight
Me old bamboo,
me old bamboo
You better never bother
with me old bamboo
You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother
with me oId bamboo
When punting on
the beautifuI Thames
You use a sturdy pole
To protect their
fair complexion
Ladies use a parasol
It's usefuI in the underbrush
To have a hefty spear
Right! But what we do
with an oId bamboo
Makes everybody cheer
One, two, three
Me oId bamboo,
me oId bamboo
You better never bother
with me oId bamboo
You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother
with me oId bamboo
Have a go, mate!
A flier in an aerial plane
He steers it with a stick
He does?
A collier in
the pits of Wales
He leans upon his pick
That's right
Now every wheel of an automobiIe
RevoIves around a shaft
But what we do with an oId bamboo
Makes everyone go daft
And one, two
Me oId bamboo,
me oId bamboo
You better never bother
with me oId bamboo
You can have me hat
or me bumbershoot
But you better never bother
with me oId bamboo
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight
And a-one, two, three, four
And a-five and six and seven
Me oId bamboo,
me oId bamboo
You better never bother
with me oId bamboo
You can have me hat

But you better never bother

You better never bother

Thank you. Here, thank you
very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.
lt's Daddy! lt's Daddy!
He's got the car!
Look! l've got it!
He's got the car!
He's got the car!
Come on! Come on!
Come on!
- Hello!
- The car!
What do you think of this?
lsn't she a beauty?
Oh, Daddy! Oh !
That's a nice pile of junk
you got there, my boy.
Well, it needs a little work,
but there's a fine engine under here.
lt doesn't go,
though, does it?
No, not yet,
but it will. lt will.
You can make it go,
can't you, Daddy?
Well, l'm gonna
give it a try.
All right, come on, everybody,
put a hand to the wheel.
George, give us a hand, will you?
Yes, sir.
Okay, heave!
We're off!
We're off! Hooray!
Comfortable, Grandpa?
Won't work, of course.
Another catastrophe.
- Left hand down.
- Come on, Grandpa, push!
Watch it, Jeremy.
Mind the bicycle.
Push.
Good. Keep coming, Jeremy.
That's it. Keep coming.
Look out, Edison.
Watch out, Edison.
Look out, Edison.
That's it.
Keep coming.
Good. Whoa! That's it.
Whoa!
All right, governor.
Many, many thanks, George.
Right.
Now. . .
Can we stay and watch, Daddy?
Yes!
No, come on, my dears,
we'd better go.
You know what your dad's like
when he's working.
But, Grandpa,
we wanted to stay and watch.
Come back
in the house, darling.
l'll make you
a nice cup of tea.
Don't overdo it,
will you, my boy?
Right, Grandpa.
You might exhaust yourself.
Come on !
"And the big brown bear
"came lolloping
over the mountain.
"'No, no,'
the princess cried.
"And the big brown bear came
lolloping over the mountain."
lt's awfully quiet
in there.
Come on, children,
breakfast is ready.
He's been there
for days!
Will you please come and have
your breakfast?
But Daddy said the car would be
finished today.
Darling, you'll be waiting a month
of Sundays before he's finished that.
Come on.
Be good children. Come on.
That's Daddy!
The car. He's finished the car!
Gosh!

Grandfather!
Come on.
We're going on a picnic.

But it is going !
Hooray!
Then it'll never stop.
Anyway, it's far too hot.

Look out!
You'll find a slight
squeeze on the hooter
an excellent safety precaution,
Miss Scrumptious.
Never mind about that.
How am l supposed
to get out of here?
Well, looks to me
as if you have to walk.
Or swim.
What? ln this dress?
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Mr. Potts.
Come on.
What are you gonna do?
l'm gonna carry you.
Oh, dear, must you?
Well, unless you'd
rather ride piggyback.
All right.
You may carry me.
Good.
Wait, wait, wait.
My handbag. Oh !
Whoa! Oh !
lt's all right.
Thank you.
Not at all.
We're going
to the seaside.
On a picnic.
Come with us.
Please.
Well, l'm hardly in the mood
for a picnic just now.
Well, you needn't
worry about your car.
l can have Mr. Coggins
tow it out.
Well, l...
We've got sausage tarts.
And marmalade rolls.
l'm afraid l got 'em
a little mixed up.
What an unusual car.
Daddy made it.
Oh. And it actually goes?
lt's called
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a curious name

Truly Scrumptious.
You know, even if we didn't

we could have guessed it.
Oh?
You had to be called
something lovely.
Like Yum Yum!
Or Angel Cake.
Or Toot Sweets.
Yes. Toot Sweets.
Toot Sweets?
Oh, no.
Toot sweets sound like what they are
So do IoIIies
in a lollipop jar
Gingerbread men

We've found
Sugarplum, cinnamon,

Tell you what they are

And your name

By coincidence,
Truly Scrumptious
You're truly,

Scrumptious as

When you're near us
It's so deIicious
Honest, Truly
You're the answer

Never, never ever go away
Our hearts beat so unruly

Aw!

Come on.
Hey, wait for me!
Mr. Potts.
Somebody call?
Oh.
Oh ! Oh, l'm sorry.
That's all right.
What are you doing?
Oh, just tinkering.
Oh.
You know, Mr. Potts, you have two
wonderful children.
Why, thank you.
l must agree with you there.
lsn't it beautiful?
Lovely. Just lovely.
Jeremy, it's not nice
to peek.
l'm not peeking,
l'm looking.
Do you think
they like each other?
Of course they do.
Do you think they're
going to get married?
Has he kissed her yet?
Not yet.
Well, just as soon as
he kisses her
then they'll
have to get married.
Jeremy,
what are you doing?
l'm keeping
a lookout for pirates.
There aren't any pirates around
here, are there, Truly?
Oh, l'm sure there are.
Hundreds of them.
'Course there are.
This is where they bury their treasure,
isn't it, Daddy?
Mmm-hmm.
Tell us a story
about pirates, Daddy.
A story about pirates, huh?
Well, let me see.
A boat!
l can see a boat!
A boat?
Did you say, "a boat"? That isn't
just any old boat out there.
- No?
- No?
No.
That is a private yacht of the notorious Baron Bomburst.
Baron Bomburst?
Baron Bomburst?
You have never heard
of Baron Bomburst, ruler of Vulgaria?
The most evil man
in the world!
- Oh!
- Yeah.
And he has sailed
all the way to England
because he has heard tell
of a fantastic motorcar
built by that brilliant inventor
Caractacus Potts.
Hooray!
Hooray!
Yes, hooray!
And he has come
to steal the car
and take it back to
Vulgaria with him.
- No!
- Yeah.
Yes!
That car!
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
l want it! l want it!
l want it! l want it!
But, Your Excellency...
Are you giving
me an argument?
No, Your Excellency.
Stand by the boats!
Stand by the boats!
Man the grappling hooks.
Man the grappling hooks.
And load the cannon!
Load the cannon!
He's awful.
He's terrible.
Not only that,
he isn't even nice.
But he can't
steal our lovely car!
You won't let him,
will you, Daddy?
Look!
They're getting closer.
We've got to get away!
Start the car.
Quickly, Daddy,
before they get here.
Well, now, that's easier said
than done.
But why, Daddy? Why?
Well, l'll tell you.
What none of us have noticed
is while we've been sitting here,
the tide has been coming in.
Now, we're completely cut off.
What are we
going to do?
Do hurry, Mr. Potts!
Now don't panic.
Everyone, stay calm !
Quickly, Daddy.
Quickly. Hurry up.
Look! They are completely cut off
by the tide.
They will all drown!
l haven't seen
a good drowning in years!
ls there anything
l can do to help?
The throttle.
Push the throttle lever.
Hurry, Daddy! Hurry!
Quickly, Daddy,
before they get here!
No, not that one,
the other one!
lt's no good.
lt won't start!
We're gonna have to swim for it.
Come on, Jemima.
We must. Come on.
Come on, Jeremy. We have to.
Come on,
everybody over the side.
Quickly!
lt's starting
to change!
Everybody, hold on !
lt's unbelievable!
Mr. Potts,
it's so clever!
This is impossible!
But you built it!
lt's a magic car.
You always said it was a magic car.
l did?
Yes. Look, it's like a boat!
l knew Chitty
would save us!
Hang on, everybody!
We're off!
A floating car?
What do you think of that, Chancellor?
Yeah, Baron.
A car floating, floating on the water.
This, in my whole life long,
it never could be seen, never, never.
lt's uncategorical!
A fuel-burning oracle.
Phantasmagorical machine!
lt's more than spectacular
To use the vernacuIar
It's wizard
It's smashing
It's keen
Oh, Chitty, you Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,
we love you
And, Chitty, our Chitty
Pretty Chitty Bang Bang
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Ioves us too
High Chitty, low Chitty,

On Chitty Chitty we depend
Bang Bang,
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
Our fine four-fendered friend
They're firing at us!
All right.
We'll show them something.
Follow that car!
Follow that car!
My word!
l want the car! l want that car!
l must have it!
Follow the car!
Stop that car!
After them! Faster!
l want the car!
l must have it!
Action stations, everybody.
We're going ashore!
Get out!
Where are
my two spies?
Ah, there you are.
Now, then, l have
a secret mission for you.
You will go ashore,
and you will capture that motorcar,
understand? Good.
But if you fail,
l will cut off your heads.
Out.
l want that car!
Now, then,
where are we?
l have here a map.
l know where we are, stupid!
We are in England!
And when we are in England,
what do we do?
We play cricket!
We play...
No. We dress
like Englishmen.
A-ha!
Remarkable weather we are having
for the time of year.
Do you not
think so, Cuthbort?
lndubitably, Basil.
You know, Mr. Potts...
Caractacus.
lt's a pretty
silly name, isn't it?
Oh, l don't think so.
You know, l really owe you
an apology.
You're more than just a father
to those two children.
Oh, yes.
Nursemaid, private tutor,
chief, cook, and bottle washer.
Everything.
Except what
they really need.
Well, it's been
quite a day.
Yes, certainly has.
Thank you, and say goodbye to
the children for me.
Yes, l will.
l hope we'll see you again.
l hope so, too. Goodbye.
Goodbye.
This lovely, lonely man
I've only known a day
I Iook at him
And cannot look away
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
I've met so many men
So easy to forget
I thought I'd grown
immune to them
And yet
He's such a Iove
He's such a lovely,
lonely man
How did he touch my heart?
How did this feeling start?
This glow that feels
so warm inside
This sudden
summer storm inside
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see
That I need him
as much as he needs me
Oh, what a love
Oh, what a lovely, lonely man
My life now has a plan
To someday make him see

Oh, that'll be a change.
You'd better

There isn't room.
Get out of the way.
Move over, you idiot!
Turn off here.

for this outrage.
You stupid fool!
Why? What have l done?

Ah, ah !

Now, remember, we are supposed to
be English gentlemen.
So let us try and behave like
English gentlemen.
So open the door!
Caracatacacus Potts.
lnventor.
Typical English eccentric.
That must be the inventor.
Hmm.
Pardon me for protruding,
but have l the pleasure
of addressing Herr...Mr. Potts?
Yes, that's me.
What do you want?
You selling something?
l don't want nothing.
Excuse me.

Africa.
That was a ruse to
put us off the scent.

Where? Where?
He has gone into
his laboratory.
Quick! The portable

What's that underneath?
That's...
That's Grandpa's hut.
But what's it
doing up there?
Well, l don't know.
Help me! Caractacus, my boy.
l'm being kidnapped !
Grandpa, what do you think you're
doing? You come down here!
Caractacus! My boy, it's me,

Caractacus! They're not getting

Sit down, Jeremy.

Right, we'll catch them up.
Oh !
Oh, we've lost them.
We'll find them,

But what about Grandpa?
Don't worry about Grandpa.

Good morning.
This is your Captain speaking.
We hope you had

ln a few moments

Where?
Vulgaria.
Oh. So, please,
fasten your seat belts.
And no smoking.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're weIcome.
Speed, four

Wind, east-southeast, sir.
Brigade, attention!
Present arms!
We have a guest.
Welcome him.
Jawohl, your Excellency.
Order arms!
Ah, Professor Potts.
Please, to walk this way.
Present arms!
On behalf of Her Majesty The Queen,

Oi!
Excuse me.
You're early!
Oh !
Down the table
and in the pocket.
Cheat, cheat, cheat.
Ah, Professor Potts!
Professor?
Vulgaria welcomes
the brilliant Professor Potts,

Excuse me, sir. There seems to be
some sort of mistake.
What?
You are not Professor Potts,
the inventor?
Well, l...
Executioner!
Executioner!
What would you like
me to invent, sir?
l will show you. My horse!
Get the horse
for his Excellency.
Giddy-up.
How proud you look
on that fine horse.
The most beautiful toy
you ever bought me, my darling.
But who is this?
This is Professor Potts
from England.
How do you do, madam?
And l think we have
a surprise for you.
Herr Professor, come on.
Well, what do you
think, professor?
Everything you need. And these will
be your assistants.
And here,
this is the Baronial car.
Can you make this car float?
Float? Like amphibial
English moty car,
float over the cresty
wave of the water.
Yes, sir, but you see, it's not
that easy without my laboratory.
Oh, l have already
thought of that.
Here is your lavatory.
lf you succeed in
making the car float,
l will make you
privy councilor.
But if you fail,
l will stuff your head with sauerkraut
and feed you to the dogs!
Feedy dorribles,
snarly horribold.
You have got 24 hours!
Twenty-four hours
and worky nosy grindstone.
Proper card he is.
Odd sense of humor.
Stuff me head with sauerkraut.
The Baron never
makes jokes.
Look at us. We've been here
for years and years.
l came here to
repair the telephone.
That was 24 years ago.
They have
terrible tortures.
The thumbscrew and rack.
They stretch you
and stretch you!
When l first came here,
l was a midget.
Come on.
Me? Floating car?
Well, that's impossible!
Nothing's impossible.
Now, that's what
my son's always saying.
We'll help you,
won't we, lads?
Nil desperandum.
We'll succeed. You'll see.
Courage, man, courage.
Every bursted bubble
has a glory
Each abysmal failure
makes a point
Every glowing path
that goes astray
Shows you how to find
a better way
So every time you stumble,
never grumble
Next time you'll bumble
even Iess
For up from the ashes
Up from the ashes
Grow the roses of success

Oh, yes!

but he wants it to float.
lt will !
For every big mistake you make
Be grateful
Hear, hear!
That mistake
you'll never make again
No, sir
Every shiny dream
that fades and dies
Generates the steam

There's magic in

Correct!
It gives you that chance

Oh, yes!

Don't you think
we ought to stay together?
Maybe you're right.
All right, come along.
Come on, children.
l wonder where we are.
l don't know.
Come on.
Pardon me, sir.
The castle?
What's the matter
with him?
Come on.
What are they staring at?
l don't know.
lt seems to be
the children.
What's the matter with them?
Haven't they seen children before?
Haven't you noticed?
There aren't any children.
Not one.
What's going on?
What's happening?
What's...Hey, you. What's happening?
What's going on?
What is it?
Soldiers! Soldiers!
Hey, you there.
Get those children in here.
Would you mind telling me
what's happening?
Quickly, before the
soldiers get here.
Soldiers?
Come, Fräulein.
Quickly, quickly.
Get inside.
Just a minute.
Would somebody
mind telling me
what's going on? Please don't talk.
We must get those
children out of sight.
Jeremy!
lf the soldiers find them,
they will take them away.
But why? What for?
lt's the law.
Nobody's allowed
to have children in Vulgaria.
Not allowed?
What about these toys?
The Baroness,
she hates children.
Who could
hate children?
Quickly,
down there!
Whatever you do,
don't make a sound.
l want every house
in this square
to be searched
from top to bottom!
Jawohl, Captain!
The first section,
step out over there
and search !
The second section,
over there and search.
Quick!
Section three, over there.
Quick! Search!
Search everywhere!
Giddy-up! Giddy-up!
There are children
here somewhere.
l can smell them.
A-ha!
Captain,
l think we've got them.
Lieutenant.
You two men, break down this door.
Quick! Quick!
Yes, sir!
Get this door open.
Quickly!
All right! l'm coming!
l'm coming! Open the door!
Break the door down !
Quickly!
You have no right to come into here.
You've no right.
Search the place!
Search! Search!
A-ha!
They are here somewhere.
l can feel it in my bones.
There are children
here somewhere.
Children? ln the toy shop?
Such a notion.
l mean...What do you think
you're doing?
That's something special
for the Baron's birthday.
Let me tell you, toymaker.
This nose of mine
has never failed me,
and if there are
children here, my friend,
you will die.
A-ha!
Quick! Open it up! Get down there
and search the cellar!
The Baroness will
have your teeth for a necklace
and your eyeballs
for earrings.
Nobody down here, sir.
Fool! ldiot!
Out of my way!
You have to know
where to look.
Like cockroaches,
they get under the floors,
in the cracks in the walls,
in the woodwork.
l don't trust
a man who makes toys
in a land where
children are forbidden.
Every toy l make is exclusively
for his Excellency, the Baron.
Captain, Captain,
the flying car!
We've captured
the flying car!
Come on !
Let's go!
Uh-huh !
Take this car
to the castle!
They can't take
Chitty, Daddy.
Daddy, do something.
They can't take
Chitty away.
What are you
going to do?
Well, l don't know,
but l'm not just gonna stand here.
Are you mad?
Are you going to take on the whole
Vulgarian Army single-handed?
What kind of a country is this?
No children!
Everybody terrified
out of their lives.
My friend,
take some good advice.
Take your children and your good
lady and get out of Vulgaria.
And leave Grandpa
up in the castle?
Oh, no. We came to get him out,
that's what we're gonna do.
Just tell me
how to get there.
Look, l'm only
a toymaker.
And if l don't
finish this in time
for the Baron's
birthday tomorrow,
l shall be
a dead toymaker.
All right. l'll go myself. Truly,
you stay here with the children.
All right. All right.
You don't know what you're letting
yourself in for, believe me.
Here's one for you,
one for you. Thank you.
Thank you, toymaker.
Keep them out
of sight, please!
You be good children. And you do
what Truly tells you.
Yes, Daddy.
We will.
Well, are you coming?
Come.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.
There isn't a scrap
of food in the place.
l'm so hungry,
my tummy hurts.
Mine's making
funny noises.
l simply must find
something for you.
Now, if you promise me not to move
from here until l come back...
We promise,
don't we, Jemima?
Yes.
Now, you remember,
you stay right here.
To get in that way,
you would have to be a mouse
or a magician.
We should go down now
before a sentry sees us.
Come. Come.
Ah, the flying car!
At last it's mine!
Send for the inventor!
Then, fly!
Fly.
Yes, fly.
Come on, fly.
Fly, fly, fly. Oh.
l command you to fly!
Bring him over here.
Over here.
Hello.
What's this doing here?
You're the inventor.
Make this car fly.
Make it fly. Go get in.
Stand back, everyone! We are going
to fly. Stand back.
Yoo-hoo, Bombie!
Wait for me!
No, every time l want to have a
little fun, she turns up.
There you are. Get in.
My darling, we're going for a fly.
How exciting.
Fly. How thrilling.
Very well. Come on.
Hurry up.
Yes, yes,
l'm doing my best, sir.
Now just a minute.
Here's one that we haven't tried yet.
Here we go,
my beloved.
Hold on !
lsn't it exciting,
my dear?
Oh !
You're a genius.
My guns! Bring my guns!
Don't worry.
l'll get you down.
l've been waiting for this for
20 years. Hold on, my love.
Are you still there, my love?
Don't move.
There she is,
Your Excellency.
Oh! Oh! My God.
My diamonds.
Are you all right, my dear?
l'm all right,
my dumpling.
Good.
Never mind. l'll get her
the next time.
Here we are, children.
Come and get your lollipops.
Lollipops.
Come along, my little ones.
Lollipops.
lce cream, chocolate,
all free today.
Listen.
Come along, children.
Lollipops.
What's that?
Children, where are you?
l know you're here somewhere.
l've lots of
lovely goodies for you.
Jeremy, you mustn't.
Lollipops.
And all free today.
Cherry pies. Cream puffs.
lce cream. Treacle tarts.
Treacle tarts!
And ice creams.
And all free!
Come along,
kiddie-winkies.
Come on !
But, Jeremy,
Truly said we mustn't...
We'll get Truly some
as well. Come on.
Mr. Man !
Hey! Wait!
Children !
Come back here!
Wait! Wait!
Come along, my little dears,
my little mice. Come to me.
What will it be?
lce cream?
Yes, ice cream!
Strawberry,
chocolate, vanilla?
Strawberry! Chocolate!
lt's all inside.
Yes, strawberry!
Come along, my little dears.
Goodie! Come on. Yes!
Come inside. Not a penny to pay.
Yes, come on.
Get in.
Go inside, my little dears!
No. Help, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Children! Children!
Truly!
Help! Help!
Help! Help!
What is it?
What's happened?
The children!
He took the children!
Your Excellency!
Let us out!
Let us out!
Silence!
Children,
Your Highness.
Foreign children.
Unique specimens.
You're sure
they can't get out?
No, Your Highness.
Perhaps Your Highness
would care to examine them.
Nasty little creatures.
Very, very treacherous.
Foreign.
Just you wait till our daddy
hears about this.
He'll come and
blow up the whole castle!
Take them away
to the tower.
To the tower!
Nasty, horrid,
mean old lady.
And very ugly.
Oh, she's going!
She's going!
Two hundred feet above us
through that solid rock
is the castle of
Baron Bomburst.
These are our children.
For 12 years, we have hidden them
here. Look at them.
They don't know
what a tree looks like
or what it is to run
or to laugh in the sunshine.
Do you, eh?
Food!
Get the food here.
Come on!
There's bread for everyone.
Look at them.
Like little rats,
they run up and down
the sewers,
stealing food
from the kitchens.
...potatoes.
Here, catch!
Son! Son!
l'm looking
for my children.
l think they're up there in the
castle with their grandfather.
Have you seen
anything of them?
No, sir.
A little boy and girl?
Yes.
They're locked up
in the tower.
And the grandfather?
He's in the dungeon
under the castle.
Sir, have you come
to help us?
Are you going to
take us out of here?
What's your name, son?
Peter, sir.
Well, Peter,
you shouldn't be afraid,
even in a terrible place
like this,
because there's
always hope.
That's what l always
tell my children when they're afraid.
A gentle breeze
from Hushabye Mountain
Softly blows
o'er Lullaby Bay
It fiIIs the saiIs
of boats that are waiting
Waiting to sail
So close your eyes
on Hushabye Mountain
Wave goodbye
to cares of the day
And watch your boat
from Hushabye Mountain
Sail far away
from Lullaby Bay
ls that the only advice
you have to offer, my friend? Hmm?
lt's a beautiful dream,
Caractacus,
but l don't see how
it's gonna help them.
You know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna get up into that castle.
lt is impossible!
Well, we'll see.
Now, everybody listen to me.
You want to get out
of here, don't you?
Yes! Yes!
Tomorrow is
Baron Bomburst's birthday, yes?
Well, we're gonna give him
a birthday party he'll never forget.
l want everybody to gather around here.
l have an idea.
Yes, come in closer.
All right, quiet!
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday to me
Happy birthday,
dear Bombie...
Don't move. What a picture!
Such memories it brings back.
My little dumpling!
You're my little chu-chi face
My coot-chi, coot-chi
woot-chi IittIe chu-chi face
Every time I look at you
I sigh
And you're my
little teddy bear
My lovey lovey dovey
little teddy bear
Yoo-hoo!
You're the Apfelstrudel
of mein eye
Your chu-chi woot-chi nose
Your chu-chi woot-chi eyes
They set my heart aflutter
Your oot-chi, coot-chi ways
Your oot-chi, coot-chi gaze
WiIts me down
like melting butter
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi,
oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Whatever you may ask
becomes my happy task
I only live to serve you
I never wiII divine
what magic made you mine
I only know
I don't deserve you
You're my little chu-chi face
And you're my teddy bear
Together we're a chu-chi, woot-chi,
oot-chi, coot-chi
Chu-chi
Woot-chi
Oot-chi
Coot-chi
Chu-chi, woot-chi,
oot-chi, coot-chi pair
Oh, what a rotten
birthday party.
Never mind,
my little Bombie.
l have a surprise for you.
Surprises?
Oh, l love surprises!
Sit down quickly.
Summon the toymaker!
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!
Don't waste time!
Your Excellency, may l be permitted
to wish you
all you wish yourself
on this happy occasion.
Never mind all that. What have you
made me for my birthday?
What have l made you?
Such a toy!
Such a work of
mechanical perfection.
Well, well, well,
where is it? Bring it in!
Right away.
l'll just get it for you.
Bring in the Baron's
birthday present!
Here, here, here.
This year, Your Excellency,
l have surpassed even myself.
Put it down there.
Careful! Careful with it!
For months, l have been working
night und day
perfecting every little detail
to bring you this!
Dolls? Dolls?
l have hundreds of dolls!
No dolls.
But this is not just an ordinary
doll, Your Excellency.
You see?
What do you see?
You people gazing at me
You see a doII on a music box
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for
Iove's first kiss
You cannot see
How much I long to be free
Turning around
on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
WhiIe
I'm
Turning around and around
What do you see?
Truly Scrumptious
You people gazing at me
You're truly,
truly scrumptious
You see a doII
on a music box
Scrumptious...
That's wound by a key
How can you tell
I'm under a spell?
I'm waiting for
Iove's first kiss
Honest, Truly
You're the answer
to my wishes
You cannot see
Truly Scrumptious
How much
I long to be free
Though I may
seem presumptuous
Turning around
on this music box
That's wound by a key
Yearning
My heart beats so unruly
Yearning
Because I love you truly
WhiIe I'm
Honest, Truly
I do
Turning around and around
Just a minute!
Oh, l'm so happy,
l could jump for joy!
Come on !
Follow me.
Children ! No! No!
No! No!
No!
Let me down !
Call out the cavalry!
Let me down !
- Jeremy!
- Jemima!
Jeremy!
They could be anywhere.
You look down that way.
l'll go this way.
Jeremy! Jemima!
Jeremy and Jemima!
Jeremy! Jemima!
lt's Truly!
Truly! We're in here!
Don't worry. We'll get you out
of here in a minute.
Here! Here, quick.
Quick, they're in there.
Children,
are you all right?
Get us out of here!
We found them. They're in there.
Come on. Help me break the door down.
Children, get away
from the door.
Children !
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
Let me down !
Ow!
My Liebchen,
are you hurt?
My back is broken.
We must escape
through the cellars.
Very well. Come on.
Come on !
Daddy, look
at the children.
You stay here.
Daddy!
What are you doing?
Where are all these
children coming from?
l thought we had
passed a law against children.
Quick. This way.
Where are we going?
Quickly. We'll go down here.
No, no.
l'll get my clothes dirty.
Don't argue.
Oh, my crown.
l lost my crown.
Oh, never mind,
my little pumpkin.
Here.
Attack!
No! Daddy!
Look! There's Chitty!
Chitty's come to save us!
Hooray!
Hello, a motorcar.
What's that doing here?
There's Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Caractacus! My boy!
Are you all right?
Oh !
Stand back from
the propellers. Keep clear.
Bye!
Bye! Bye!
Bye! Bye!
And so, after that,
Vulgaria became a free country,
and all the children laughed and
played in the sunshine,
and they were very,
very happy.
And Chitty flew high
over the mountains
back to England,
everybody safe and sound.
And Daddy and Truly
were married.
And lived happily
ever after.
Yes.
ls that how
the story ends?
lt's getting late.
We better get back.
Well. . .
Goodbye, Jeremy.
Goodbye, Jemima.
Goodbye, Truly.
Will we see you again?
Oh, l expect so.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Truly.
l'm sorry about the children.
l hope they didn't embarrass you.
ln what way?
Why, that silly joke
about us getting married.
Well, you know what kids are like.
Yes, l understand.
l mean, l don't think they realize
how ridiculous that would be.
Ridiculous?
Well, yes.
You live in that big house,
your father,
the factory and all.
lt's a different world, Truly.
You know, if l said something like
that, you'd call me a snob.
l didn't mean...
Goodbye.
Well, don't you
want to ride up front?
Well, that was a fine picnic,
wasn't it?
Shall we have
another one tomorrow?
With Truly?
Yes.
Well, Miss Scrumptious has a lot of
social engagements, you know.
Are we ever going to
see Truly again, Daddy?
Well, we'll see.
Look,
that's Lord Scrumptious' car.
Why, l believe it is.
l wonder what
it's doing here.
Well, l don't know.
Come on.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Are you...
Boom! Boom! Boom!
That's wiped out
your dashed cavalry.
Yes, sir.
But l have my 2nd lnfantry battalion
attacking here from the rear.
Attacking from the rear?
That's dashed unethical.
Artillery,
prepare to open fire.
Fire!
Number one battalion,
prepare to advance!
What's going on here?
There you are, young Potts.
Been waiting for you.
And that wiped
out your artillery!
You're a cad, Potts.
Would someone mind
telling me what's going on?
Fancy you being
old Bungie's son.
Bungie? Bungie Potts,
best batman l ever had.
Weren't you, Potts?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
You mean that you were...
My boy.
Allow me to introduce
to you my Brigadier.
Your Brigadier?
Potts...
How about some more tea?
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
As for you, young man, there's a
very good chance you may be very rich.
Very rich?
What do you mean?
Those confounded
sweets of yours.
Useless for humans,
wonderful for dogs.
Woof Sweets,
that's what we'll call them.
Woof Sweets?
Canine candies. Dogs love them.
Make a fortune.
Daddy, Daddy!
You've done it, Daddy.
You've done it!
Have l?
lt's the posh life
for us all now, my boy.
We're all going to be rich!
Hooray!
Do you mean to tell me l invented
something that actually works?
Of course they do. Wouldn't be offering
you a contract unless they did.
Sign here, please.
Wait. Don't go away.
l'll be right back.
What about the contract?
But, Daddy,
where are you going?
Daddy!
What's the matter
with the fellow?
Well, he's a bit of
an eccentric, sir,
a genius, of course,
but definitely an eccentric.
Can't imagine
where he gets it from.
Truly, you'll never
believe it.
l just got home...
This is beginning to be...
...and your father was at my house.
...a hazard.
l know! l know!
They told me at the house.
We're rich.
You know, more than that,
l have succeeded.
l always knew you would.
You know something else?
The kids were right.
There's nothing so ridiculous
about the idea of getting married.
Well, whoever said
there was?
Well, Mr. Potts.
What's the matter?
Now you'll have to
marry me.
So dreams can come true.
Yes, they can.
Yes, they can, but you have to
be practical, too.
You have to face the facts.
Man has to see things
as they really are.
After all,
a man with responsibilities
can't walk around with his head
in the clouds all the time.
A man should keep his feet
solidly on the ground.
Oh, a man should have
his dreams
but a man has to learn to put those
dreams to some practical use,
not just sit around and think
about them all the time.
