: Ah...
MAN: Mm. What are you reading?
Hm?
The Overcoat by Gogol.
Gogol?
Uh-huh.
Mm-mm.
Never heard of him.
I'm just reading.
My grandfather gave me this book.
Hmm.
Seen much of this world?
Uh-uh. I went to Delhi once.
Every year I visit my grandfather in Dungarpur.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
: Not this world.
I mean, England, America.
I was in England for two years.
It was like a dream.
Sparkling clean streets.
Nobody spitting on the road.
Have you ever thought
of going abroad?
No.
You should.
You are young.
You are free.
Let me tell you something.
Pack a pillow and a blanket.
See the world.
You will never regret it.
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for.
Hmm.
To travel without moving an inch.
: Mmm.
To each his own.

§ §
Show us.
§ §
Sis, you're home late.
Hurry, go and prepare yourself.
There is someone waiting to see you.
Watch and learn, Rini.
Hm?
Mmm...
She is fond of cooking.
And she can knit well.
She made a cardigan for me in one week.
She is the children's favorite Auntie.
She has been
learning classical music since childhood.
It's notjust that she is my daughter...
Here she is.
Uh, my son has been living abroad...
for the last two years.
He's in New York.
He's doing his PhD in the
field of fiber optics.
Hm?
Hmm... hmm.
Our daughter's best
subject is English.
Won't you recite something for us?
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills
When all at once I saw a crowd...
A host of golden daffodils.
:
This was my father's
favorite poem.
Used to read a lot, my father.
Please.
My child?
Have you ever flown in a plane?
Will you be able to go
halfway across the world?
Live in a cold city...
with freezing winters...
Leaving your family and friends very far away?
Won't you be lonely?
Won't he be there?
Huh? Oh!
Come to me.
Your life is about to change.
Embrace the new.
Don't forget the old.
And your new life--
Enjoy it fully.
Let me see her.
§ §
Are you there?
It is freezing today outside.
Bread... milk...
apple tea...
The rest we'll buy
from the Indian shop
after I come home in the evening.
You are going out?
I've been away three weeks.
I have to go.
How are you feeling?
It will take you
several days to recover.
After all, you've just flown
halfway around the world.
Go lie down. I'll bring you tea.
It is the American way.
Now go, go.
I can't.
Okay.
OK then, sit and watch.
Here we get gas 24 hours of the day.
Look, this is how you turn it on.
Hot and cold water, too.
Red one and blue one.
Don't confuse between the two.
You will get burned.
And you can drink water
straight from the tap.
No need to boil it.
Our washing machine is
just down the street.
I will show you when I come home.
Now...
Once you are settled,
I will take you
to my department
and introduce you
to my professor here.
You won't believe it.
Our rickshaw drivers
dress better than professors here.
§ §
§ §
§ §
Just a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
ASHl MA: I am very happy.
And everything here is wonderful.
The planejourney
was long but enjoyable.
And I'm feeling fine.
How is Rini?
The house is very nice.
Big, with lots of windows.
Do you know...
over here...
we get gas all day and all night.
All these have shrunk.
I mean, who asked you to wash my clothes?
Why didn't you just wait until I came back?
Here one dollar is 8 rupees.
We only have so much money to buy...
Where are you going?
Hel...
Ashima.
Ashima?
Open the door, Ashima.
I'm sorry.
Ashima.
It's my fault.
Your intention was good.
It was my mistake not to tell you.
Ashima, please, open the door.
My Ashima.
My Ashima, crazy Ashima,
open the door, Ashima.
Oh, my dear, open the door.
Please?
Crazy girl.
Don't smile.
Sorry, Baba.
ASHOKE: Take One or Three train
from here all the way to...
Fulton Street.
Get out of the station,
ask anybody...
"Where is the Fulton fish market?"
And if I get lost?
You think I'd let you get lost?
§ §
§ §
Uh...
What happened?
Come.
Come to me.
Do you have a longer frock?
What's that?
Uh... I need to here.
And hide those gorgeous legs?
Here we go. Let's get you
under the covers. Here we go.
All right.
Time those contractions.
All there.
I already checked.
His eyes are black as a blackberry.
Black as his hair.
How are you feeling? Was it all right?
Being rescued was the first miracle of my life.
You are the second.
Mrs. Ganguli, I'm Mr. Wilcox.
You, um, have a name for the baby?
One minute.
My husband is coming.
He's asking about the baby's name.
Yes, the name.
We are waiting for my wife's
grandmother to choose.
Will she be here soon?
She is in India.
She is more than 85 years old.
But there is no hurry.
Some of my cousins, you know,
they were not named
until they were six years old.
Until then they were all called
by their daknams only.
Daknams?
Pet names.
We all have two names.
One pet name-- daknam.
One good name-- bhalonam.
Unfortunately in this country
a baby can't be released
from the hospital without
a birth certificate,
and a birth certificate
requires a name.
How about"Baby Boy Ganguli"?
Baby Boy?
Uh, uh, till
the letter arrives.
Afterward we can change it?
Is that what we should do?
I wouldn't.
Endless red tape.
Expensive, too.
Sleep on it.
Baby Boy Ganguli?
Gogol.
Gogoloo.
What do you say?
We could call him Gogol.
Till the letter arrives.
Later we could change it
on the birth certificate.
Mmm.
We would not be here
but for Gogol's blessings.
Hold still.
Hold still.
Don't move.
One, two, three.
Say"cheese."
Uncle, Auntie.
Look, Gogol.
Did this just come?
How beautiful.
...Gogol!
Gogol!
Hey, lady-killer!
I want to go home.
I don't want to raise Gogol
in this lonely country.
Think of Gogol's future.
This is the land
of opportunity, Ashima.
He can become
whatever he wants,
study whatever he desires.
You know, options are limitless.
Don't you want to give him that?
Huh?
Here you go.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Come here.
Yeah.
Fish.
Leave it, leave it, leave it.
Come. Come.
Don't go so far
that I cannot see you!
He's too little!
MAN: Welcome to suburbia, Ashoke.
You have a beautiful house, Ashoke.
Congratulations.
Everything is bought in a yard sale.
Ashima does not like it,
but I say, what is wrong
with it, you know?
Even my chairman,
who lives in a huge mansion,
wears a tie he had
bought for 50 cents.
That is America, Ashoke.
Hey, guys.
Hey, kids, catch it.
ASHl MA: Gogol?
Where are you?
Hey, Gogoli.
Poor Baba.
He's probably
feeling very left out
because of his sister
Sonia's naming ceremony.
Is he going to be called Gogol
in school?
No.
We have decided on a good name.
Finally.
What is it?
Nikhil.
Bah.
The all-encompassing one.
Of course they will turn it
into Nick, you know.
Gogol?
Hey, Gogol.
He's here.
Missing your sister's ceremony, huh?
Hey, Gogoli.
I found him!
GOGOL: I don't like the baby.
Sonia, eat this.
And now will be the grand finale.
Ashima.
What will your baby
girl's future be?
Her future will soon be revealed.
She wants everything.
Ask her to pick up the pen.
Hey, Sonia, pick up the pen.
Pick up, pick up.
Be the first female...
Put the dollar in her hand.
Pick up something, Sonia.
American girl must be rich.
She's not picking anything.
So...
how did you like your first day
in big school?
Great!
Oh.
And what is this?
"Due to your son's
preference,
"he will be known as
Gogol in school.
Mrs. Lapidis, Principal."
Hmm.
And what about your
parents' preference?
Hmm?
ASHl MA:
In this country the children decide.
He wants to keep Gogol
and not Nikhil as his good name.
Fine.
No big deal.
With a president named Jimmy,
there is nothing we can do.
As long as our kid is
happy, you know.
So late?
Hello.
Hello?
MAN: Hello, Ashoke...
Can you hear me?
I have terrible news.
I can't tell my sister.
Don't, don't worry, I, I will.
ASHl MA:
He told you something you're not telling me?
Yesterday when
your father was
playing patience
on his bed,
he died of a heart attack.
Father!
Be calm, Ashima.
At least he went peacefully.
§ §
Gogol, go on.
Go on.
Look, Baba, Gogol!
Where?
Ashima.
G-O...
...G-O-L!
ASHOKE: Oh, very good, very good.
Come on, we'll lose the plane.
Huh? Come on, come on.
I can't go.
I can't bear to see them in mourning.
You can't be like this.
Think of your mother.
Think of your son.
They need you to be strong.
Push, push, push...
Not your ordinary
guy, Nikolai Gogol.
Hey, Gogol, it's your namesake.
Today, he is respected
as one of Russia's
most brilliant writers,
but in his own lifetime
he was understood by no one.
Least of all himself.
One might say
that he was an eccentric genius.
Yo, Gargle, way to go!
Shut up!
Hey, Mr. Hatch!
Mr. Epstein!
I will see you both after class.
Thank you. Out. Come on.
Out.
Thank you,
gentlemen.
Now, Gogol was reputed
to be a hypochondriac.
He was deeply paranoid,
frustrated, friendless.
He never married
and he fathered no children.
Ooh.
Towards the end of his life
he proceeded
to commit slow suicide
by starvation.
Gl RL: What?!
Did you guys know
all this stuff
about him when you
decided to name me?
That he was paranoid, suicidal,
friendless, depressed?
ASHOKE: You forgot to
mention that he was
also a genius.
I don't understand
how you guys could
name me after someone so strange.
Don't talk back to your father.
And don't call us"guys."
Sometimes when l
close my eyes
and listen to you both,
I feel I have given
birth to strangers.
Just because you're graduating
does not mean you can
behave like this, Gogol.
So, I'm two inches away from her.
Her luscious lips part.
Just as I'm about to kiss her...
she looks at me and she says...
"What's your name?"
Gogol Ganguli.
End of Seduction 101.
Plain Jane loves your name.
:
Gogol, Gogol, I love you.
Gogol!
Oh, Gogol!
Don't bogart that joint, man.
You know, of all
the frickin'
Russian writers in the universe...
...why'd they have to go
and choose the weirdest?
What the hell's wrong
with Leo or Anton?
Shit. You know, I just want
to sit 'em down and be, like,
"Man, Gogol is your
favorite author, not mine."
Shit.
What?
I got the thing. Oh, shit.
Hey, where you going?
See ya!
Good-bye, Air India!
Whoo-hoo!
: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
They have been here
for two hours already. Come.
This is our son, Gogol.
Sorry I'm late.
ASHOKE: Hey, Gogol.
Mr. and Mrs. Mazumdar,
they just moved
into New York from London.
Oh, wow, that's far.
WOMAN: Hey, Gogol...
Hey, Mira Mashi.
I'll show you something.
And this is our daughter, Moushumi.
Both the same age also.
Oh.
They'll have a lot in common.
Oh, I'm sure.
GOGOL: Hi.
: Hello.
What are you reading?
Bonjour Tristesse.
In French.
Oh...
Want to go watch some TV?
I detest American television.
Ml RA MASHl: Gogol...
Come and sit next
to your Mira Mashi.
Come. Come.
Why are your eyes so red?
Someone's envy has definitely...
I'm fine.
Ashima...
Chilies.
Nicky?
Hmm. Oh, Mira Mashi.
I promise you there
are no evil eyes
in the United States of America.
That is what you think.
You be careful where you're going.
What is the name?
Yale.
There will be plenty of girls
in this Yale place
who will want to trap you.
Have as much fun as you want.
Mm-hmm.
But...
BOTH: Marry a Bengali.
Gogol?
Hey, Baba.
How are you feeling now?
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Uh-huh.
Thank you.
Good.
Listen.
I have never given
you any presents
apart from what
your mother buys, but...
for your graduation,
I have something special.
§ §
Thanks, Baba.
I ordered this
just for you from the bookstore.
Took four months to arrive.
I hope you like it.
Very nice.
Thanks, Baba.
Thanks again.
You know, I feel a special
kinship with Gogol
more than with any other writer.
Do you know why?
Yes.
Gogol's your favorite author.
I know, Baba.
Apart from that,
he spent most of his adult life
outside his homeland.
Like me.
Right.
But...
there...
there is another reason.
Hello?
Hmm?
What's the other reason?
No, there isn't.
Okay, good night.
Good night, Baba.
We all came out of Gogol's overcoat.
One day you will understand.
MAN  :
Your attention, please.
Indian Airlines announces
the departure of their
flight Ic408 to Calcutta.
WOMAN  : Ladies and gentlemen,
on behalf of Indian Airlines
and Captain Das Gupta,
we hope you enjoy your flight.
WOMAN: Flight Ic408.
§ §
Take out the luggage.
Gogol!
Hi, Daadima.
Take her size.
Earphones.
Earphones!
Go buy two pairs of slippers from Bata.
Only from Bata.
Please take your present.
For you, mother-in-law,
a sweet for a sweet.
Oh, New York and Calcutta.
What's wrong with you?
I want to go home.
I have something
that'll cheer you up.
Here. My planner says
that there are only
89 days left to go.
What is wrong with you?
What, are you hot?
You're hot? Here.
Have some ancient air conditioning.
Go away!
You are going out?
Jogging.
Jogging?
Running.
On the street.
I'm in training.
Training?
Yep. Don't worry, Daadima.
I'm not gonna go far.
Chotu?
Chotu?
Ah. What?
Quick. Follow young master.
He's gone running on the street.
Keep your eye on him.
Can you do that?
I can do anything. I know English.
Oh, good morning.
Gogol, Gogol, Gogol!
Gogol!
Take pity on a fat man!
Stop!
Gogol!
Stop!
Grandma said to keep my eye on you.
They sent you to follow me.
Heart.
Chotu... die.
Don't die.
Want to go back?
There is something
I always wanted to ask you,
but never had the courage.
All those years ago, why did you...
say yes to me?
You were the best of the lot.
Huh?
Better than the widower
with four children
and the cartoonist with one arm.
Gl RL: Please?
You have an extra..?
Oh, my God...
I also liked your shoes.
Oh. Oh, okay, okay.
You want me to say...
"I love you"...
like the Americans?
Eh.
Huh.
Huh.
Stop sulking, Sonia.
You actually look really
great in that outfit.
It suits you.
Shut up!
Hmm.
Why don't you get in,
my American son?
Sonia can sit on my lap.
Come on.
No. Because being pulled
by another human being
is feudal and exploitative,
and I don't want to be part
of something like that,
because...
Hmm.
Ma, stop!
It's embarrassing me!
Okay, guess where
we are going tomorrow.
Another relative's house?
No.
The botanical gardens,
for the hundredth time.
To Agra to see the Taj Mahal.
Are you serious?
You're not kidding?
Really?
Mm.
That's awesome, Ma.
Oh, my God!
It's a wonder of the world.
Come on.
We should have taken the plane.
Don't worry. Everything is fine.
Nothing is fine.
It's right here.
Huh?
§ §
I've always wanted
to come here with you.
Just imagine how much Shah Jahan
must have loved Mumtaz
to make this for her.
Other husbands also love
their wives, Ashima.
Only we cannot afford
to build Taj Mahals.
Hey, guess what?
I think I'm gonna major
in architecture.
What about engineering?
Come on, Baba.
Architecture has everything.
It's got engineering, drawing,
aesthetics.
Our family Shah Jahan.
§ §
Show you something.
Look.
"Gangrene."
What the...
Can you believe this?
I'm gonna catch
the racist punk who did that.
ASHl MA: Don't be upset. Come on.
Frickin' welcome home.
Just some kids having fun.
GOGOL:
So,
I've been thinking a lot
about my name.
"Gogol's" fine on-on
my high school diploma,
but can you imagine"Gogol"
on a résumé or a
credit card after that?
What are you trying to say?
I'd like to change my name back
to my good name.
ASHl MA: What is done is done.
Now Gogol has become your good name.
It's too complicated now.
You're too old.
And anyway,
you have only yourself
to blame.
Oh, yeah.
It's my fault
'cause I was four years old?
That's right, Goggles.
Ow!
Anything is possible in America.
Do as you wish.
An excellent choice, sir.
GOGOL: I'm home.
Hi, Nick.
Hello.
Hi, Lydia.
How you doing?
Good. Have you got it?
Yup.
Where's my girl?
Where's my Master of Fine Arts?
Congratulations.
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you all so much for coming.
This means so much to me.
Drink! Celebrate!
Beep, beep! Excuse me,
darling. Sorry.
Ooh. There we go.
Cake?
I still can't believe
it's over already.
Hey.
I'm gonna get a drink.
Hi.
Nick.
Open it.
You like it?
Yeah. It's beautiful.
LYDlA: Hello!
Oh, I want you to meet
the young Indian architect
who has so captured Maxine's heart.
Oh.
This is Pam Burton,
a dear college friend,
and this is Nikhil Ganguli.
How do you do?
Maxine, look who's here.
It's very nice to meet you.
You, as well.
Now, how old were you
when you moved to America?
I was actually born in New York.
I'm from here.
I once had a girlfriend
who went to India.
Came back thin as a rail.
I'm sure.
I was horribly envious of her!
Don't your parents want you
to marry a nice Indian girl?
I don't care what they want.
This is what I want.
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick...
ASHl MA:
Sally gave them to me
before anybody else
could check them out, huh?
Ah. Reading Chekhov.
What perks I get
from my wife, the librarian.
Mmm.
MAN: What, are you blind?
MAN: Today, huh?
Uh...
WOMAN: Hey!
MAN: Lady, get out of the way!
You have to learn to drive faster.
Don't talk to me.
I will have an accident, huh?
If you keep on driving like this,
you will have an accident.
Everything's fine, Mom.
Mom, why are you calling me?
Hey, hon.
ASHl MA: Because you're not
at your apartment.
Shh, whoa.
You are never
at your apartment, Gogol.
In the middle
of the night,
I have called and you are not there.
I am, Ma.
I need my sleep.
I turn off the phone.
Ooh.
Gogol, are you there?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here, I'm here.
I want you to come
home next Saturday.
Then you can
come with us
to the airport the next day.
Baba is going to teach in Ohio
for six months.
You remember or not?
Yeah, I remember, Mom,
but what's the big deal?
He's only going to Cleveland.
Sonia's not coming home.
Sonia lives in California, Gogol.
: Mom, I can't come
home that weekend.
I'm going on a vacation
with my girlfriend.
Her parents have a place
in Oyster Bay.
Mom?
Would you mind if we went
to go see my parents
on the way to Oyster Bay?
You mean I'd finally
get to meet them?
Mm-hmm.
I'd love to, baby.
: Oh, that's too much.
I'm back...
You know, he is willing
to go on vacation
with someone
else's parents,
but not to see his own.
Oh, forget it, this is America.
As soon as the kids turn 16,
they're gone.
I lost the company
of my parents
when I first came to this country.
Now I feel I'm losing my
family all over again.
Besides, what kind of a
girl is called Max, huh?
Maybe it's a boy.
There are some things
you should know.
Um, no kissing, no holding hands.
My parents are not Lydia and Gerald.
I've never seen them touch,
let alone anything else.
A little depressing.
Ah, a little bit.
You know, you really don't
have to get all this stuff.
Come on,
why are you getting truffles?
God, they won't like
them, will they?
: No.
Come on, Nick, everyone
loves truffles.
GOGOL: Ma, we're here.
Ma.
Hi.
Ma, this is Maxine.
Max, this is my mother.
Hello, Ashima.
It's so nice to finally meet you.
Mm.
These are for you and Ashoke.
Oh.
There was no need.
Thank you.
Please come in.
Come.
Thank you.
Please sit.
I will get drinks.
It's nice.
Thank you.
This is where you grew up, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nikhil's father is upstairs
with the man from the alarm company.
Why on Earth are you getting
a security system?
It was your father's idea,
now that I will be on my own.
You know,
even in good areas like this,
these days there are crimes.
Ashima,
I've been admiring
what you're wearing.
Is this,
uh, a kanta?
: Oh, yes.
I grew up with fabrics.
My mother curates textiles
at the Met.
The Met?
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.
You remember, Ma, I took you there.
It's the museum with all the
steps and the Egyptian temple.
Uh-huh, I remember.
My father was also an artist.
That painting you're seeing there...
that is his painting.
Oh, it's nice.
MAN: We're all set, Mr. Ganguli.
ASHOKE: So it'll be installed
tomorrow, all right?
Uh-huh.
Let me give you a receipt.
Hmm, it's really lovely.
Thank you, Mr. Odin.
GOGOL: Hey, Baba.
Hi.
This is Maxine.
Max, this is my father.
Hello.
Hello, Ashoke.
How are you?
Fine.
Fine.
Hmm.
This is the best Indian
food I've ever tasted.
Nikhil's mother has been cooking
for the past two days.
It's better
than this boy here makes.
ASHOKE: Oh...
I forgot the ice cream.
Nikhil, come with me
to Breyer's, would you?
Sure.
I'll come with you.
Why don't you stay here and
keep Nikhil's mother company?
We'll be back in no time.
Yes?
Okay.
ASHOKE:
I wanted to tell you something before I leave
for my semester in Ohio.
It is about your name.
My name?
Yeah, Gogol.
There is a reason for it, you know.
I know.
Gogol's your favorite author.
I remember.
It is more than that.
It was, uh...
1974 when I was a
student in Calcutta.
Every year I would take
the train to visit
my grandfather in Dungarpur.
I carried one book with me
to read on thejourney.
Gogol?
Yes, The Overcoat.
So, in the train late at night,
a Mr. Ghosh befriended me.
He kept trying to persuade me
to leave India...
...I was in England for two years...
...and I just wanted
to get back to my book.
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for:
to travel without moving an inch.
And that's when it happened.
Find anybody?
§ §
Nothing here, keep going.
Found anybody?
No survivors.
Look-- the man holding the book!
He's moving. Come quickly!
ASHOKE:
I kept hearing Ghosh's voice in my head.
GHOSH: Pack a pillow and blanket.
See the world.
You will never regret it.
That is how I came to America
and you got your name.
Come.
Maxine will be waiting for you.
Baba, is that what you think of
when you think of me?
Do I remind you of that night?
Not at all.
You remind me of everything
that followed.
Every day since then has been
a gift...
Gogol.
Samosas for the journey.
Thank you.
Thank you for lunch.
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye.
Bye, Ma.
Same here.
Remember to check in
on your mother now and again.
Okay, Baba.
And call to let us know
that you arrived safely.
I will.
ASHOKE: Drive safely, Gogol.
What did your dad just call you?
I'll explain later.
MAXl NE: I'd never have guessed
they're your parents. You're so different.
Oh, we're here.
This is beautiful.
You like?
Yeah.
It's a perfect example
of New England Victorian.
Thus spake my architect.
We got truffles!
GOGOL: Hey, Gerald. Hey, Lydia.
Hey!
Hi, Boomer! Hi!
GERALD: Hi, Nick.
MAXl NE:
This is my absolute favorite place on Earth.
I can map my life here.
You know, I envy you this place.
My parents never felt the need
to be so far away from things.
Where did you guys go?
On the road.
In rented vans, we would
travel with Bengali families
to see other
Bengali families,
inevitably getting
lost along the way.
Dads mulling over AAA maps
on the side of the road.
And when it was time to eat,
we would pull over again
at some rest stop and pull
out a nine-course Indian meal
from a bunch of tiffins
when all I really wanted
was McDonald's to begin with.
It was kind of fun,
though, you know,
if you didn't know anything else.
Mm...
Well, you're here now.
Mm...
So, Ms. Maxine Emma Faye,
what's it gonna be?
The museum job or
the book on Montagna?
I don't want to think
about it right now.
I want to be free!
He never called.
I'm sure they're fine.
Hmm.
It is you I am worried about.
You know, being alone...
for the first time.
No big deal...
as the children always say to me.
It is easy for them, Ashima.
They grew up here.
You will be alone, too.
How will you manage?
But I will see you
every third weekend.
I wish you would change
your mind and come with me.
Hmm?
Come.

TELEPHONE OPERATOR:
That was Radcliff?
I do have a number for a
G. Radcliff in Oyster Bay.
But I'm afraid it's unlisted.
Happy Birthday, Gogol.
Happy Birthday, Nick.
Thank you.
Ooh!
Make a wish.
LYDlA: Yea!
Thanks, you guys.
This is really nice.
You just... see?
§ §
Hello?
ASHOKE: Hello, Ashima?
Hey.
I was just thinking about you.
The shrubs the children planted
need to be pruned.
Ashima, I'm in Cleveland General Hospital.
What happened?
I don't know. My stomach's been
bothering me since morning, and I was...
invited by some Bengali
students for dinner.
Take an Alka-Seltzer?
I did.
It didn't help.
I came to the emergency
room because, uh...
all the doctors' offices are
closed today.
So who drove you there?
No one. I am here on my own.
I, uh...
Really, it's not that bad.
I wish I had come with you.
I was also so selfish--
only thinking about myself.
Ashima...
Don't worry. It is nothing.
Ashoke, what does the doctor say?
I'm waiting to see him.
There's a long line.
Very long line.
And don't worry.
Hmm.
I am feeling better already.
Huh?
All right.
Ashima...
I'll call you when I get home.
Okay.
ASHOKE  :
This is Professor Ganguli.
Kindly leave a message.
Yes.
"G" for green...
"A" for apple...
"N" for Nancy...
"G" for gold...
"U" for umbrella...
"L" for letter...
"l" for India.
I have already spelled
my name five times.
WOMAN: Uh, I'm just going to
have to put you on hold, ma'am.
WOMAN: I apologize for the wait.
To whom am I speaking?
Ashima Ganguli.
Ashoke Ganguli's wife.
Who I am speaking to?
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm the intern who first
examined your husband.
I have been holding on
for half an hour.
Is my husband still there,
or has he gone?
He said he will phone me.
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
We've been trying to reach you.
The patient, your husband...
Ashoke Ganguli,
passed away at 5:35 p.m.
Hello?
It is a mistake.
He was not there for emergency.
Only for stomachache.
Your husband had a massive
heart attack.
All attempts to revive him failed.
Is there anyone
in the Cleveland area to
identify and claim the body?
§ §
§ §
§ §
That's why the Blair Building's
my favorite.
Yeah, it's beautiful.
Hi.
LYDlA AND GERALD: Hi.
Jesse...
Come here,Jesse.
Come here.Jesse!
Jesse,Jesse.
Uh, Nick, your mother called for you twice.
Sit, sit!
Okay, thanks. I'll give
her a buzz in the morning.
Okay.
What about it?
What about this?
It's nice. It's the colors for downstairs?
Hello?
Yeah.
For just that little...
Nick, it's your sister this time.
I might wear it for the...
Hello, Sonia?
It's so pretty, isn't it?
Nice.
I like it.
Do you like this?

ASHOKE: I take 20 rounds
every morning before going to work.
Baba...
I'm sorry, Baba.
Father?
Is that you?
Ma.
Gogol.
You didn't have to do this, Son.
I wanted to, Ma.
§ §
Excuse me, have
you seen Nick Ganguli?
Oh, um, he's over here.
Somewhere.
So tragic about Ashoke.
Him going like that.
I'm so sorry.
Hey.
Hey.
How are you?
Good.
Thanks for bringing my stuff.
WOMAN: Gogol.
Bring ghee for the ceremony.
Excuse me.
The ceremony's about to begin.
Do you want to sit?
MAXl NE: Thank you.
Come sit down.
So when are you coming back
to the city?
I don't know.
They've given me a month.
More if I want.
I miss you.
I know how hard
this must be for you.
But you guys can't stay
with your mother forever.
You know that.
Listen...
I really, really,
really, really,
really want to come
to India with you
to scatter the ashes.
It's a family thing.
I thought we were family, Nick.
You were certainly part of mine.
I have so many regrets, Max.
You're bound to.
Listen...
why don't we still go away
for New Year's?
Like we planned.
It might do you good
to get away from all this.
I don't want to get away.
:
What do you want from me, Nick?
I'm trying to be here for you,
but it's like I don't
even know you anymore.
Max, this is not about you.
Go carefully.
Maxine?
We will all miss him, you know.
Yeah.
Your name?
Gogol.
Father's name?
Ashoke.
Your name?
Ashima.
Husband's name?
Ashoke.
Gogol Baba.
Maybe you should let
bygones be bygones now.
What do you mean?
Make up with Maxine.
Ma, you never liked her, did you?
That is not the point, Gogol.
The point is that now you should
move on with your life.
You know,
by the time I was your age,
I had already celebrated
my tenth wedding anniversary.
This is America, Ma.
People have twins when they're 60.
Oh, Gogol, very funny.
Uh, do you remember, uh,
Moushumi Mazumdar?
"I detest
"I detest
American television."
American television."
Mm, don't be so rude.
You think your accents
don't sound funny to other people?
Poor thing.
Terrible, terrible tragedy.
You know, she was supposed
to have been married.
But it was canceled
at the last minute.
The invitation cards were sent out.
The hall was booked, even.
She's also in
New York-- alone--
doing her PhD.
I told her parents,
"Don't worry, Gogol is also
there. He will call her."
Hey, hey, hey, Ma!
You don't have time for
one cup of tea, Gogol?
Her parents came to
Baba's funeral, also.
This is the least we can do.
Okay, look, time out.
Let's say
that I take her out to tea, okay?
Then what? What are we going
to talk about?
As far as I recall,
she doesn't even speak.
Only reads.
Weird French stuff, Ma.
Bye, Ma.
Later, Goggles.
See you later.
This is her number.
Ma...
Call her if you want.
Don't call her if you don't want.
Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you.
Nikhil.
Yes.
As opposed to Gogol?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Single malt, please. Thanks.
Okay.
WAlTER: Single malt.
I've never done this before.
What's that?
Gone out on a blind date
engineered by my mom.
It's not a blind date exactly.
No?
No, we sort of
know each other, in a way.
Here you go.
I don't remember our
ever talking, really.
Actually, neither do I.
Does your family still live in
the same house I used to visit?
Yeah.
I remember the kitchen.
It had these very blue cupboards.
Yeah, those are still there.
I was sorry to hear
about your father.
Oh.
How's your mother getting along?
She's all right.
You know, Sonia's been living
with her, so that helps.
So why'd you leave Paris
for New York?
Wouldn't you rather study
French literature in France?
I moved here for love.
Surely you know about my
prenuptial disaster.
Not really.
Well, you ought to.
Every other Bengali living
on the East Coast does.
So, uh...
should we make
our mothers happy
and see each other again?
Maybe.
Give me a call.
Okay.
I know why he went to Cleveland.
He was teaching me how
to live alone.
MOUSHUMl:
So of course, my mother is
appalled that I'm not cooking
you Indian food.
You told her I was coming over?
She called today.
What about you? Have you been
giving your mother updates?
Sort of.
Oh, God! I need to add more liquid.
Are you all right?
God. Um...
Yeah, um, could you
please help me
with my glasses?
Get them off for me.
§ §
God, did I really say that?
You sure as hell did.
No wonder you never
talked to me back then.
Hey, I tried.
You were the one who used
to treat me like an untouchable.
How'd you get so sexy?
Paris.
Paris.
After years of convincing myself
I'd never have a lover...
...I began to have affairs.
How many?
How many what?
Lovers.
You don't want to know.
MAN:
But you must understand
that without fire,
this entire ceremony's invalid.
I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot allow you
to light a fire
anywhere within the hotel premises.
§ §
ASHl MA: I wandered...
lonely as a cloud
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills
When all at once
I saw a crowd
A host of golden daffodils.
You're next, Sonia. Beauty!
§ §
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
Mmm-hm, mm-hmm.
Mmm? Ah.
Hmm.
Hmm?
§ §
Mmm!
$101 from the Banagi family.
All right.
That brings the total...
...to $7,035.
:
Not bad, Mr. Ganguli.
:
I'd say we made a killing, Mrs. Ganguli.
Oh, hold it, hold it.
Ms. Mazumdar's the name.
We've already discussed this.
Yeah, but I thought, you know,
both names.
Do you know how many
letters that is?
lmagine spelling
that over the phone.
I've begun to publish under my name.
No one would know me.
Oh, come on, Nikhil.
What if somebody asked you to
change your name?
I already have, remember?
Forget it, I was just
being silly, Ms. Mazumdar.
GOGOL: But it's our anniversary.
MOUSHUMl: So, we'll celebrate.
Wish we didn't have to go.
Tonight of all nights.
We promised.
No, no, no, no. We didn't
promise. You promised.
I bought your gift.
Mmm-hmm.
Have you bought mine?
I'm not buying it, I'm making it.
I'm designing a dream house
for you, Ms. Mazumdar.
So you're just gonna have to wait.
So, we're thinking Prescott.
I'm sorry? Prescott? Why?
Prescott?
It's a family name.
What does it mean?
The name should mean something.
Where have you been?
Just keeping Donald company.
What does Moushumi mean?
A damp, southwesterly breeze.
Well, stop worrying.
If he doesn't like his name,
he can always change it.
I'd never change my name.
It's my grandmother's.
Nikhil changed his.
Really?
What do you mean,
he changed his name?
Nikhil, it wasn't the name
he was born with.
Well, what name were you born with?
Gogol.
As in The Overcoat?
Yes.
Ah, I get it.
Nikolai Gogol.
Exactly.
What in the world made
your parents choose that name?
My father was a fan.
What I told you about
my name was personal.
: Nobody cares.
It's not just some joke
or conversation piece, okay?
And for you to bring it up
in front of these people...
These people happen
to be my friends.
You know, I had a life
before I met you.
You can't wish away my past!
You know I can't read French.
It's an offer to teach...
at the Sorbonne.
Don't worry. I turned it down.
I'm going to be a
good Bengali housewife,
and make samosas every
Thursday from scratch.
It's so hard to know
what to do sometimes.
I was looking at this Joseph
Campbell book the other day.
And he says
when you feel lost,
you should close your eyes
and think of when
you were most happy.
Not thrilled.
Just... deeply happy.
It's called"following your bliss."
You wanna try it?
Well?
Ashima? You all right?
Hmm.
I've been thinking of leaving.
Is that very selfish of me?
You know, I thought now that the
children are both well settled.
§ §
One day...
I hope you will turn to this book...
and remember.
Your Pierre.
ASHl MA: You don't know how
happy I am
that both my children
have found their life partners.
You don't mind
that Ben's not Indian?
Times have changed.
No, I don't mind.
He's a very good boy, you know?
And he makes Sonia very happy.
She is following her bliss.
You've been reading Joseph Campbell.
It's you.
Frying samosas with my mother-in-law.
And you?
See you later.
Kisses.
I still can't believe my little
sister's getting married.
Better believe it, Goggles.
ASHl MA: I have something to say.
Gogol, I did not want
to tell you on the phone.
Uh, I have decided
to sell the house.
I am going
to do what
your father and l
had always planned.
Six months in India,
and six months here with all of you.
And then I can
go ahead and start
my singing again in Calcutta.
That is, if any guru wants
a 45-year-old student.
Of course they will.
Of course, Mom.
I want to be free.
Mm-hmm, like your name.
GOGOL: What do you mean?
Ashima means"without borders."
"Limitless."
Mo.
ASHl MA: No Mo. Your ma.
Hey, Ma. What's up?
Uh, Gogol, there's a buyer
for the house.
Are they meeting your price?
Yes.
Then do it, Ma.
I have told them they will have
to wait until after Christmas.
Both of you are coming, aren't you?
Of course.
It will be the last party
at Pemberton Road.
I know.
I don't see it.
Ooh.
So, this year...
Mm-hmm.
...they're renting a house
in the Pyrenees for the summer.
Oh.
And I told them we might join them.
Astrid and Donald
for an entire summer.
Can't.
Yeah, but the Pyrenees
are so beautiful.
Pierre says it's possibly...
Who's Pierre?
Hmm?
Are you having an affair?
Are you?
Who is he?
Someone I've known a long time.
Why?!
I saw myself becoming my mother.
I saw myself stuck.
Look, maybe it's not enough
that we're both Bengali.
That's not why I love you.
So, when are you giving us
the good news?
Just because
your mother's going
doesn't mean you have
to forget about us.
Yes. You must come over.
You should not feel shy.
Hey...
Hey.
Remember, we're your family, also.
Mm-hmm.
And we're still there.
Thanks.
Dude, I am never gonna
remember all these names.
It's all right, man.
You don't have to.
Just call everyone Auntie.
You'll be fine.
Sonia?
Where's Moushumi?
Ah.
Uh-huh.
Nah. Nah.
Ah.
We all came out of Gogol's overcoat.
One day, you will understand.
Hey, Gogoli.
Hey, Ma.
Oh, Baba...
Everything is okay?
Hmm, between Moushumi and you, hmm?
Ma, Moushumi found someone else.
Some... some old boyfriend.
A French guy named Pierre.
For once, somebody else's name
bothered me more than my own.
Oh.
It is all my fault.
I am sorry, Gogol.
Ma...
Ma, it has nothing to do with you.
We're different people.
We wanted different things.
I will not go back to India now.
I cannot go.
Oh, you have to go.
Listen to me...
you know, l-I know that
I'm supposed to be devastated.
Everybody's gone,
but... I know this is
gonna sound crazy, but
for the first time in my life,
I actually feel free.
Look...
Look what I found.
It's Baba's graduation gift
from high school.
See?
ASHOKE:"For Gogol Ganguli.
"The man who gave you his name,
from the man
who gave you your name."
There are no accidents, Gogol.
Baba made you find it.
He is with us.
§ §
ASHl MA:
Don't go so far
that I cannot see you!
He's too little!
Jump,jump.
Are you listening?
The camera.
It is in the car.
All this way, and no picture.
Huh?
We just have to remember it then, huh?
Will you remember this day, Gogol?
How long do I have to remember it?
Ah, remember it always.
Remember that you
and I made the journey,
and went together to a place
where there was nowhere left to go.
ASHl MA:
For 25 years, I missed my life in India.
And now,
I will miss my life here,
and all of you
who became my family.
I will miss
living with my daughter
and the surprising
friendship we formed.
I will miss phoning my son
at all times of day or night.
And I will miss
this country
in which I had grown to know
and love my husband.
And though his ashes
are scattered in the Ganges...
...it is here, in this house,
in this town,
amongst all of you...
that he will continue
to dwell in my heart.
Hear, hear!
Long live Ashima.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers. Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Thank you.
GOGOL:
"After several minutes blushing all over,
"he begin reassuring them
quite simple-heartedly
"that it was not
a new overcoat at all.
"That it was just so,
that it was an old overcoat.
"Finally, one of the clerks,
"even some sort of assistant
to the chief clerk said,
"'So be it.
I'll throw a party instead
of Akaky Akakyevich..."'
ASHOKE: Pack a pillow and blanket.
Go, see the world.
You will never regret it, Gogol.
