Our village sat high in
the mountains of southern Turkey.
It was half-Turk,
half-Armenian.
I was the local apothecary.
For 200 years,
the Boghosians made medicines
using formulas handed
down from our ancestors.
We treated everyone alike,
Muslim and Christian, rich and poor.
I was proud of our craft.
But making potions from herbs
and minerals was not enough.
My greatest desire
was to study medicine
at the Imperial School
in Constantinople.
But I could never
afford the fees.
So, I decided to become
engaged to Maral
and use the dowry
to pay my way.
Here you are,
some tea.
Thank you.
Can I ask you
a question?
Do you really want
to do this?
We will build a future
together, Maral and I,
and we will grow
to love each other.
And you will
be proud of us.
Give this letter
to your Uncle Mesrob.
He is an important man
in Constantinople,
but he has never
forgotten his roots.
He will take
good care of you.
I will make
you proud, Papa.
The Boghosians will bring more
than medicine into Siroun.
Always remember,
God has given you this mission.
May He bless
and protect you.
Whoa, hey.
What a day, huh?
The best wine, finest food,
and the perfect match.
Thank you for your
generosity, Harut.
Karine. That's it.
Thank you.
Four hundred gold coins,
as agreed.
My daughter's future
and my trust in you.
Spend it wisely.
You won't regret it, sir.
Normally, it takes
three years to become a doctor,
but I know that I could
complete it in two.
It will pass
quickly, Maral.
Not quickly enough.
I will pray for you
every day.
Thank you.
Whoa.
I'm going
to the Grand Bazaar.
Sir?
No, sorry.
Please.
No, thank you.
Ah, my friend.
Better prices here.
No, no.
Better prices here.
I'm going here.
This Armenian dog
will rob you.
Hey, hey, hey.
Get back to your thieves' den.
Always trying
to steal my customers.
Please.
What can I
sell you today?
Are you Mr. Mesrob Boghosian?
Mesrob Boghosian, yes.
What, is it a bill?
No, no, no.
This is from my father,
Vartan Boghosian.
I'm Michael.
You're Vartan's son?
Yes.
Why didn't you say so?
Speak up! Come here.
Hello, uncle.
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Good morning.
Thank you. Please.
Ah, here's my sweet Yeva.
Ah... Oh!
Say hello
to Cousin Michael.
Hello.
Hello, Yeva.
Please. Please.
Hmm.
And here is
my beautiful wife, Lena.
Michael Boghosian,
Cousin Vartan's son.
Michael?
Yes.
Welcome to our home.
Thank you.
And my pearl, Tamar.
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hello.
Oh! What a view.
Here is Europe. There is Asia.
The world is at
your feet, Michael.
Do us proud.
How old
is this suit, huh?
Come by my shop sometime.
We need to dress you like a doctor, huh?
Ah. That's the girls' tutor,
Ana Khesarian.
The great violinist's daughter,
just back from Paris.
Those are your notes?
Yes.
So, you've already studied medicine?
Yes, it's my passion.
Female anatomy.
That's my passion.
I have no interest in medicine.
My father gave me two choices.
This or the military.
Emre Ogan. You?
Michael Boghosian.
Good morning,
gentlemen.
Welcome to
the Imperial Medical School.
Good morning.
Good morning.
We haven't been introduced.
I'm Michael Boghosian, Mesrob's nephew.
Ana Khesarian.
Lovely to meet you.
Lovely to meet you, too.
Would you like some coffee?
Please.
Yes, thank you.
You're an artist.
I try.
May I take a look?
Please do.
Huh.
These are excellent.
Thank you.
So, Mesrob tells me
you're from Siroun.
Yes, I'm from Siroun.
My family is from
the village of Ardoo.
Ah! Ardoo. Yes, I've been there.
You have?
Yes, yes,
I'm the local apothecary.
And now you're going to become a doctor.
That's wonderful.
Yes, yes, um,
I will do that.
Go back to the region
and set up a clinic there.
I intend to go back
there also, I think.
Reconnect with my family.
Dance time.
Yes!
We dance each morning
before class.
It releases the soul from here,
out to the extremities,
the hands, the brain, the feet.
It's both spiritual
and medicinal.
Why don't you join us?
No, no, no, no.
Come on, Cousin Michael.
Dance with me.
It's wonderful.
All right,
you want me to dance?
Let's go very, very slowly
for Cousin Michael.
So, throw your arms up
to the wind.
Now, dance
through the forest.
Through the forest.
Through the fields
of flowers.
Through the fields of flowers.
Now, sweep them
into your arms.
Arms.
And cast them
to the heavens.
Exactly.
He's very good.
All right.
He's a very good dancer.
Goodbye.
Bye.
It's medicinal.
The deceased died
from cancer of the bowel.
Monsieur Boghosian,
please remove the spleen.
Very good.
Now, Monsieur Ogan,
can you please remove the
lesion on the small bowel?
Lesion?
The cancerous growth.
Hey. Come on.
It was shit. Well, what do
you think is in a bowel?
Come with me.
Michael.
Ana.
What a pleasant surprise.
Chris, Michael is the nephew
of Monsieur Boghosian.
Uh, Christopher Myers.
Hi, nice to meet you.
The legendary Chris Myers.
Emre Ogan.
Notorious playboy,
frequents opium dens.
How, and why the hell,
did they let you in here?
Good to see you.
May I introduce
Mademoiselle Ana Khesarian.
Constantinople is blessed by your beauty,
Mademoiselle Khesarian.
Nice to meet you.
Please, join us. Sir.
I'm so happy we get to meet
when I'm not teaching.
Yes, what a surprise.
Chris is a star reporter
for the Associated Press.
We met in Paris when my
father was Deputy Consul.
His father was a spy.
That's why you were such
a good drinking companion.
You were looking
to expose us.
A toast, to old friends
and new. Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.
What brings
you here, Chris?
Is it the war?
The AP star reporter comes east.
The war is coming east.
This place is so boring.
It is boring.
I know the perfect place.
Absinthe makes
the heart grow fonder.
No, no, no, no.
Dance with me. Please, come on.
I don't know... I don't...
I don't know
how to dance this.
I'll teach you.
Oh, no. Poor Michael.
He needs help.
Let's swap.
Oh. Hello.
Behave.
How are you?
I think I was
being attacked.
I think you were, too.
Bravo.
Oh, what a night, huh?
Yes.
Sunday is my birthday.
My family are having a party
for me at Ciragan Palace.
You must join me and save me from
my father and his guests. Please.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you.
And thank you.
You make me feel like I'm home.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Good night.
Good morning.
Michael!
You made it.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
You look absolutely amazing.
Oh, thank you.
Please join us.
That's my father.
He's a bigot. I'll spare you
the frosty introduction.
Come with me.
Dear all, this is my friend and
mentor, Michael Boghosian.
Nice to meet you.
Ah. Here's Ana. Alone.
Chris seems to have abandoned me.
I'm sorry.
Foolish man.
Some champagne?
Uh, water, please, for now.
Hello, Ana.
Hello, Michael.
Everyone, Ana Khesarian.
Hello.
Hello.
Nice to meet you all.
Ah. I hear
a French accent.
I lived in Paris for many years,
but I'm a proud Armenian.
This is a glorious day,
General.
We have a flotilla
waiting to greet your ships.
Would you like to escape the
Germans for a little while?
Yes, I think I'd love that.
Let's take a walk.
I do sketches for some Parisian
magazines and American newspapers.
You're lucky to have
traveled the world.
My mother died
when I was 10.
So after that, my father took
me all over Europe with him.
He played for...
for the Kaiser,
for... for Queen Victoria.
Wow. Huh.
It was wonderful.
And then, um...
And then he insisted I stayed
in Paris to attend La Sorbonne,
and that's what I did.
But, um...
That was
a terrible mistake.
Why?
Because he killed himself.
He was drowning in debt,
and I had no idea.
If it wasn't for Chris,
I would have lost my mind.
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my God,
what was that?
Chris!
Where were you?
We just took a walk.
Ah. You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You see that?
Did you see?
German... German battleships.
Yes.
A gift from the Turkish Navy.
Perfectly... Perfectly innocent gift
from Teutonic friends
to the Turkish Navy.
Turkey has every right
to have a strong navy.
The Empire needs
to protect its borders.
The Ottoman Empire wants
its borders to stretch
from the Atlantic
to the Indian Ocean,
and what these fellas...
These Germans want your sultan to
declare a holy war against the infidel.
The British, the French,
and the Russian. Hmm?
Curb your tone, Mr. Myers.
This is not Paris.
It's certainly not Paris.
It's not Paris, okay.
I apologize.
Yes, you do apologize.
Maybe Berlin.
It's starting to look
a lot like Berlin.
Gentlemen, let us
celebrate this great day.
Chris.
You've made your point.
You've made your point.
Armenians aren't singing?
Oh, that's right.
You're the resident infidel.
You'd be the first to go
when the war breaks out.
Chris, man, please.
Ana!
I let my anger
get the better of me.
But the Germans,
I can't stand their arrogance.
Their arrogance? You insulted me.
You insulted my friend.
I'm sick of
your drunken behavior.
I can't take it anymore.
I will stop drinking.
I've heard that before.
No, I swear. I swear.
Please sit down.
I'm sorry.
You wanted to come,
find your roots,
and start over.
I understand. I support that.
I love what you're doing.
I love your illustrations.
They complement my work.
I love that
we are partners.
We have something
very special.
Don't give up on that.
Over there. Line up.
Line up over there.
Over there. This way.
Everyone must line up.
Hey, Armenian, gonna teach you
how to fight and die now.
Get in line.
No exceptions. Everyone line up.
Next.
Emre Ogan.
Sadly, I must accept the
medical student exceptions.
Next.
Hello. Good day.
Boghosian from Siroun?
Yes. Yes.
You have been assigned
to the third military division.
Uh, um...
I am a medical student.
So?
Uh, I would like to apply for
a medical student exemption.
You're not a Turk. Armenians
have to apply in their hometown.
I can't go
all the way back.
- I can't go all the way back.
- Officer.
Mr. Boghosian is
a medical student.
His loyal family are good friends
of my father, Ogan Pasha.
Now, he would
appreciate a favor.
Of course.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, my friend.
You really thought I'd be
in line to join the army?
Where are you going?
There's something bad
going on around Konya.
I need to investigate.
And listen, it's very dangerous
for Armenians right now.
When I get back,
I'll get you an American visa.
I want to get you out of here.
No.
What do you mean, no?
No. I'm not going to pack up and run
off at the first sign of trouble.
If it's not safe for me, then it's
not safe for any of my people.
Ana, this is different.
This... I'm staying.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes, I'll be there.
Yes, I'm coming right now.
I have to go. We'll discuss
this when I get back.
All right.
Ana, you, uh...
You be careful.
You be careful.
Yes.
Emre.
Come.
Father. Dr. Nazim,
salaam-alaikum.
Alaikum-salaam.
It has come to my attention
that you used my name
to procure an exemption
for an Armenian.
He's my friend, Father,
entitled to an exemption.
The Armenians are a tumor
in our midst, Emre.
Do you understand?
Tumor, yes.
You took this
military exemption?
Yes, Father, I need to learn
how to identify tumors,
so that I can best serve.
Don't you agree, Doctor?
Hmm.
Good night.
Ana! Ana!
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!
Ana! Ana! Ana! Ana!
Thank you.
May I? You got chocolate
on your face.
Oh!
Yes.
Gone?
Yes.
Thank you.
Oh. Um...
I was wondering,
Father Komitas is singing
at the cathedral on Sunday.
He's a dear friend, and my father
accompanied him many times.
Would you like
to come with me?
Yes.
Of course, I would love to.
Wonderful.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
Ana is a fine woman,
Michael.
Yes.
Chris is
a very lucky man.
Hmm. Lena tells me things are not so
good between her and the American.
You know, women talk.
It can't happen, Uncle.
Why not? She's very fond of you.
It's obvious.
I'm betrothed
to a girl in Siroun.
You are betrothed?
Yes.
Her name is Maral.
We're using the money from the
dowry for my studies here.
Betrothal.
My father, your great-uncle,
was a cruel man.
He matched me with a witch.
She tormented me every day.
Barren as the desert.
Thank God she died.
Then I found Lena,
a good woman from our province.
How much is this dowry?
Four hundred gold coins.
I've used 100 already.
You give it back.
All 400, and 200 more
to ease their trouble.
Money is not a problem.
I will give you the money.
I made a promise.
I...
I can't go back
on that, Uncle.
Hello!
We must leave, sir!
Hey!
We cannot be here.
We must leave. It's forbidden.
Wait!
Come.
We must leave. Come!
Wait, wait, wait.
Go over there.
Go over that way.
Nein.
Go over that way.
Nein.
Stop the car!
We can't stop!
Stop! Stop the car!
Stop the car! Get out. Get out!
No, this is my car.
I'll pay you more.
Here. Here, here.
Here. I'll come back.
Get out.
That's my car!
This is my car!
Get in! Get in!
Kill him!
Please, stop!
Please, stop!
No! Stop!
Get away!
Stop!
Get in. Quick.
Give me a key.
Here. Room 12.
Take him up.
Thank you.
I will send ointment, hot water.
Thank you.
They set fire
to his shop.
Oh, my God.
Let me take
a look at you.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Were you throwing cabbages?
And a couple of potatoes.
They can go make soup.
Sorry.
Where are you going?
I need to go
back to the hotel.
You can't go alone.
It's not safe.
No. No. No,
I better go alone.
I need to sort
things out with Chris.
I'm coming with you.
A young child tried
to pull her to her feet,
and as she lay
on that dirt road,
a Turkish cavalryman rode up and
dispatched her with a single shot.
Write it. Write it.
Good morning.
Here you are, Miss Khesarian.
Thank you.
All right,
hold for more.
Oh, my God.
What?
It's from Lena.
She's in trouble.
Where were you?
What are you
doing here?
Were you with this bastard last night?
Wait, look.
Please calm down, all right?
That's enough.
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
- Mr. Myers.
Mesrob has been arrested,
and Lena is alone with the girls.
We have to go right now.
Mr. Myers,
New York is waiting.
Ana.
We must go, Chris!
- Ana!
- Mr. Myers, New York.
We will lose
the connection.
Armenian men are being
slaughtered in their villages.
Their women and children are
being driven into the desert
to be murdered!
Send that!
Lena!
Lena!
Michael. Michael.
What happened?
Oh, Michael.
They've taken Mesrob.
Who has taken him?
State Security have taken
him to Sikedji Prison.
They said he's being
investigated for treason.
All right.
Wait here.
- Is Papa coming back?
- Oh, Yeva.
The men said
he's an Armenian traitor.
It's a mistake, Yeva.
Your father is a good man.
I'll go speak with Emre.
He'll help us get Mesrob out.
I'll bring your papa
back home. Don't worry.
Michael.
Mesrob Boghosian?
Yes.
This is good.
All right.
Father Komitas.
You come with me.
I need you to point out your uncle.
You can wait here.
Him. That's my uncle.
What?
What's happening? Please.
Sir, I have an exemption.
Emre.
I warned you.
You will join the army today.
The captain will escort
you to your barracks.
I do not want
to lay eyes on you
until you restore honor
to the family name.
Sir. Sir. Please,
I have an exemption.
...involving the mass arrest of
intellectuals, bankers, and clergy.
It does appear to be
an attempt to stifle
and silence
the Armenian population.
Please, come in.
Yes.
Ambassador Morgenthau, can I get
back to you when I have more news?
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
Chris, this is
Mesrob's wife Lena.
They have nowhere to go.
Come here with me.
Nice to meet you. I'm so sorry.
Please, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.
Let me get a cloth
for your face.
Will you excuse me?
Take his place.
Help me. Help me.
Please!
Don't let me die.
Come. Come.
All right.
You should thank me.
I eased your burden.
Thank me.
I said, thank me.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
He's better off dead.
We'd all be better off dead.
We won't have
long to wait.
Another month,
winter will come,
and we'll freeze
in these mountains.
They need us for this railroad.
No, they don't.
They're going to kill us. I know.
How do you know?
Do you see that?
It's a bullet.
It's still there.
Went in my cheek,
bounced up here.
I was in the battalion
building the Drizi Road.
And when we finished,
they brought in machine guns.
Blood everywhere.
A few of us survived.
Spared to dump
the bodies into a ravine.
Let me see this.
If we find something
sharp and some thread,
I can take this out.
No, no.
It's my good luck.
You a doctor?
Medical student.
Mmm.
I was a clown
in the circus.
I used to make
the children laugh.
The dynamite is weeping.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Shoot him!
Thank you.
Water!
Water!
Some water! Water!
Get us out of here!
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Help us get out of here!
Hello? Yes!
Open the doors. Please.
Save us. Help us!
Thank you! Thank you!
You're Armenian!
I'm Armenian!
Please, help me! Please!
Come. Come.
These are our sons.
Did you see them?
They were conscripted
in Tarsus.
No, I'm sorry.
Tarsus is close?
Yes.
I am from Siroun.
Do you know it?
I know of it.
God bless you both.
Food, please.
Wake up!
Wake up, you traitors!
Wake up, traitors!
Great news.
Our victorious army have driven
the British back into the sea,
and the Russian dogs
have fled for their lives.
Be ready, Armenians.
We will find you a new homeland.
Who are you?
We have nothing here.
Mama.
Oh, Jesus.
Thank you, Jesus.
Papa. Jesus. Jesus.
Thank you.
All the young men
are gone.
Our business is gone.
We have nothing left.
Praise God,
at least we have you.
I can't...
I can't stay here.
They'll kill us all
if they find me.
Where will you go?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Rest up, son.
Michael.
Oh!
I'm not a ghost.
Michael,
thank God, you're alive.
Harut has the answer. As soon as
I told him, he had the answer.
Get dressed
and he will explain.
Come.
Come. Sit down.
Hello.
Maral.
Michael.
Here's my plan.
I keep a cottage
for my woodcutters.
It's high in the hills.
No one ever goes there.
You'll be safe. We must hurry
to make all the arrangements.
Maral will prepare all the
provisions you will need.
Vartan and I
will bring the priest.
The priest?
Yes. Oh.
We'll have to have the wedding
at the cottage tomorrow.
It is too dangerous for you
to go to the church.
Tonight, you can
leave for the hills.
My prayers
have been answered.
You'll sit out this war.
Make babies.
Praise God
you've been spared.
What's wrong?
In Constantinople,
I fell in love with someone.
I can't do this.
I can't marry Maral.
You have to marry Maral.
Whatever happened,
that was another life.
You told me you would
grow to love Maral,
and you will, my son.
You will.
Here you are.
That's it, come in.
Everything you will need
for a quiet life.
I will bring you supplies
each week.
Welcome.
Thank you.
Tell me
about Constantinople.
Is it as magical as they say?
There are churches and mosques
like you couldn't believe.
The finest fashions
from Paris and London.
And the Grand Bazaar,
you could buy anything you want.
From a camel
to a crown.
Were you happy there?
It was a different life.
Can I help you?
Pastor Merril?
Yes. Who are you?
I'm Christopher Myers
from the Associated Press.
I have correspondence
from the US Embassy,
and I have money
from the Church Relief Fund.
God bless you. You're heaven sent.
God bless you.
Hello, welcome.
Welcome.
Dozens of orphans
are arriving every week.
Most of them have just seen their
parents murdered before their eyes.
This whole country
is a graveyard
of bloated bodies
polluting the rivers.
Corpses rot
in the desert.
I was told that you're organizing
an escape route for orphans.
Who told you that?
I want to go with them.
This is a historic endeavor,
needs to be recorded for posterity.
A group of orphans left for the
port of Bassek a few days ago.
When the guides return,
you can leave with the next group.
Thank you.
Lena won't come with us.
Why?
She won't leave
without Mesrob.
She wants to stay in Siroun
with Michael's family.
I want to take her there.
I need to go
and talk to his family.
I really do.
Would you come with me?
Of course.
Thank you.
My eyes get worse, Marta.
Nonsense.
You see well enough when you
count your money.
We'll get you
better glasses.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Lena. Lena Boghosian.
Lena! Come in.
Come in. Oh.
Vartan.
Lena.
Close the door.
This is
your Uncle Vartan.
Who are you?
Oh, they are my friends.
They saved us, thank God.
Mesrob has been deported
to Chankiri.
They took our house, everything.
And then they came and...
We are good friends of your son
Michael from Constantinople.
Michael is dead.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear that.
There are spies everywhere.
You're a foreigner.
You'll bring trouble
down on us.
Marta, please. They have
cared for us, Marta.
No, no, she... It's okay.
We should leave.
He was a very good man.
I'm truly sorry.
Lena is with
her family now.
We will take care
of her and the girls.
Ana.
Ana.
God bless you, Ana.
Ana.
Are you all right?
I think I am with child.
Deputy Governor, welcome.
The order from Istanbul is
that no one's to be spared.
You should evacuate the
orphans as soon as you can.
Who are you?
I'm Christopher Myers.
I'm from the Associated Press.
Ah, yes, Mr. Myers.
I've been alerted that you're in my district
and you're to be detained and deported.
I have all the official documents
from the Sultan's office
and from the American Embassy.
Mr. Myers, I suggest
you leave this place.
I've done all I can, Pastor.
Please take my advice.
Thank you,
Deputy Governor.
I'm risking my life
being here, Mr. Myers.
I want your word that
you will not expose me.
You have my word. Absolutely.
I would never reveal a source.
You need to get those
children out of here, Pastor.
Who is it?
Mama, it's me.
Michael.
Why are you here?
What's wrong?
She's sick.
Let's get these
wet clothes off.
We must get her
to bed. Come.
It's a very
difficult pregnancy.
She needs better nourishment.
She needs calcium, iron.
Perhaps after she rests,
we can...
Michael?
Lena?
Oh, my God. Lena.
Oh!
I... I thought...
Are the girls here?
Yes.
Yes? And Mesrob?
They still have him.
How did you get here?
Ana and Chris brought us.
- Ana was here?
- Yes.
I told them
you were dead.
Why?
You trust no one.
Where is Ana now?
Michael, you have to leave
before the sun comes up.
They were at the American
Mission at Moodan.
The missionaries
have an escape route
to get orphans
out of the country.
They're going
with them soon.
Ana wanted us to go, but I won't
leave here without my Mesrob.
Escape? How?
By boat from Bassek,
I think.
Michael, seeing you
alive has given me hope
that my Mesrob
will also survive.
Yeva is restless.
I have to go.
Michael.
I have to find them.
Michael,
leave these people alone.
You're safe in the woods.
No, no, I'm not safe.
No one here is safe.
Don't you see what's happening?
We have lived through these
Turkish threats before.
It's not threats.
They want us dead.
I have to get us out of here
before there's no time left.
Trust me. It's all right.
I'm getting us out of here.
When will you be back?
Soon.
Soon?
Very soon.
My parents will take care
of you till I come back.
Don't worry.
All right. All right.
Almost done.
Close your eyes.
One and two...
Ana.
Thank you.
I can't believe you're here.
Lena tells me that you
are headed for the sea.
That you have a way out
of the country. Yes.
Ana, I need your help.
My family in Siroun,
I need to get them out.
Of course. Yes.
I have a wife.
When we met
at Constantinople,
I was already betrothed
to a girl in my village.
When I returned home,
we married.
I'm sorry, Ana.
Michael is alive.
I saw.
He wants us to help his
wife and his family escape.
We have to help them.
And after that, he'll be gone,
and we'll never see him again.
Here you go.
Mr. Myers, when you arrive in Bassek,
find Reverend Antreassian.
He'll arrange
the boats for you.
And tell him we'll be along with the
rest of the orphans as soon as we can.
Thank you.
You're a brave man.
Thank you. God bless you.
And take care of them.
Hyah!
We're close to Siroun.
We'll find a place to rest
while I get my family.
Here you go.
Oh, my God,
you're so heavy.
- May I have some bread?
- Oh, yes, me, too.
Thank you, Ana.
Thank you, Ana.
I'm guessing that your wife
knows nothing about Ana?
What?
How do you intend
to introduce them?
Why? Are you going
to report it?
Is this what you do?
You feed off the pain
and misery of others?
Without reporters, the Armenian
people would disappear,
and no one would know.
How wonderful it must be
to go back to the comfort of your
American home and write about it.
- What was that?
- What's going on?
Mustafa, get the mules.
Ana, load them up, we should leave.
- Everybody get up.
- Take my hand.
Get into the carriage
right now. Quickly.
Mira, help me.
That's our horse. Oh, God.
Papa.
Michael.
Mama.
Mama.
Oh, thank God.
Yeva!
Run! Michael, run!
Ana! Mustafa!
Oh, my God!
We have to go now!
Ana!
- I'm coming.
- Go! Go! We need to go!
Chris! Come back!
There he goes!
Turn around!
American!
American reporter!
I have papers. Here.
Get down.
I'm gonna get off the horse.
Don't shoot.
Here. Travel documents
from the Sultan's office.
Permission.
Mama. Mama.
It's over. It's over.
Mama.
All right?
Mama.
Michael, tell me,
please, where's Lena?
They're all gone.
They killed them all.
Mr. Myers, I am Faruk Pasha,
commander of this region.
What is the Associated Press
doing here, Mr. Myers?
Uh, reporting on the war.
There is no war here.
Merely the evacuation of the civilian
population to a safer region.
"The gallant
Armenian partisans of Van
"put up a heroic resistance
against Turkish divisions,
"inflicting heavy casualties."
Hardly objective reporting.
This is my favorite.
"A Turkish official,
"a man of unshakeable
humanity and courage,
"informed us
that Faruk Pasha,
"a general notorious
for barbarism,
"has been instructed
by the highest authorities
"to spare no village."
Are these words
your fabrications,
or the words of some
lying Turkish traitor?
Prove to me that you did
not fabricate these words.
Give me the name of the
high-ranking Turkish official.
I'll confirm he gave you this
information and release you.
Uh...
No.
You are not
a journalist.
You are a foreign agent.
You insist there is war here?
Very well.
Under the military code
of war,
I'm obliged to execute you!
No, no, no. No, no, no, no!
Don't! Don't! Don't!
To execute you
as a foreign agent and a collaborator!
Don't! Don't!
Now,
was that my barbarism
or mercy?
Take him!
Who are you?
We're fleeing Siroun
on the way to Bassek.
This is Bassek.
No one left in the village.
We were told to find
a Reverend Antreassian,
and he would arrange
for a boat for these orphans.
There are no boats. The Turks
have destroyed them all.
Who are you?
I'm the mayor of Bassek.
The Turks are on their way
to drive us into the desert.
You'll find Reverend
Antreassian back there.
Excuse me. Reverend Antreassian?
Back there.
Reverend Antreassian?
Hello.
We are from the American Mission.
Hello.
We were told to meet you in Bassek.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Faruk Pasha sent orders that we
were to be evacuated to Aleppo.
Mayor Stepan announced that
we would not obey the Turks.
We have brought
the orphans with us.
You need to come with us.
We will care for you.
There's this American reporter,
Chris Myers. Did he find you?
No. No, I have not
encountered any Americans.
Oh.
Thank you very much
for your help.
Emre. Am I glad
to see you.
You're in very serious trouble, Chris.
Hmm.
They're going
to make you disappear.
I need your help, Emre.
I need to get word
to the American Ambassador.
He can stop this.
Help?
I'm in this ridiculous uniform
because I tried to help Michael.
Now, you're asking me to
commit an act of treason? I...
Listen, Chris, they're
willing to offer you a deal.
You sign it,
you'll live, Chris.
You'll go to jail, but your
government will get you out.
The world knows
you're not a spy.
If I sign this confession,
destroys everything
I've ever written.
My reputation, my future.
Future? What future?
Trust me, my friend, if you do not
sign this, your future ends tonight!
No one knows you are here.
No one will know you died.
You'll know.
Hey.
Listen to me.
The Turks will come
soon to punish us.
Join me and fight them,
or you should leave now.
Fight them? With what?
With whatever weapons
we have.
With stones and rocks
and our bare hands.
I will not walk out into the desert
to starve or to die of thirst.
We have brought enough food
to reach Aleppo.
You'll never make it.
You'll be murdered along the way.
Who are you
to spread such rumors?
Right now,
outside of Siroun,
you'll find the bodies of every
Armenian from my village,
rotting in a river.
Every man, woman, and child,
marched from their home,
brought there, and slaughtered,
all of them.
My father, my wife,
stabbed, slashed open,
our unborn child
ripped from her womb.
You don't believe me?
Hmm?
Go. Go look for yourself.
Follow the vultures
and the smell.
You have heard this man.
He speaks the truth.
We will not walk
like sheep to slaughter.
We will make refuge
on Musa Dagh.
And if the Turks will
not leave us in peace,
we'll fight them
from every rock.
Let's move!
Michael.
I'm so sorry.
We need to prepare.
Ambassador Morgenthau,
my apologies for the delay.
What is the problem?
I have reason to believe,
Talaat Pasha,
that your military is about to
execute an American citizen.
We have captured a spy.
He is indeed an American.
Christopher Myers.
Both our countries
have the same punishment
for spying
during wartime, no?
The United States
is not at war with Turkey.
Myers attacked our men, and he has
been collaborating with traitors.
Nonsense.
He's a world-renowned
journalist.
He's a spy,
and he has used journalism
to smear the Ottoman Empire and
its soldiers around the world
with his fabrication about the
relocation of the Armenians.
Minister, you are using this
so-called "relocation" as a cover
for the systematic extermination
of the Armenian people.
Christopher Myers has been reporting
this outrage to the world.
That is why you want
to silence him.
Ambassador, you're Jewish.
Why are you so concerned about
these Armenian Christians?
I am a Jew
and I am an American.
Many Americans
have fled persecution,
and they are appalled
by what is taking place here.
Now, I am making
a formal request
that you release
Christopher Myers.
And I must caution you,
any harm done to him
will be considered
an act of aggression
against the United States
of America.
Good day to you, sir.
One thing, Ambassador.
The New York Life
Insurance Company
and the Equitable Life
of New York have,
for years, done considerable
business among the Armenians.
I wish you would get these
American life insurance companies
to send us a complete list
of Armenian policyholders.
They're practically
all dead now,
and they have left no heirs
to collect the money.
It all, of course,
reverts to the state.
The government is
the beneficiary now.
You will never get
any such list from me.
All right, this is where
we will build our tent.
This is going to be
the best tent of the camp.
- Who will help me?
- I will! I will!
Let's get started.
We have only a few weapons.
Don't take one unless you
know how to use it well.
Can you shoot?
Yes.
- Can you shoot?
- Yes.
Can you shoot?
Yes.
Are you the one he fell in
love with in Constantinople?
He told me he loved you,
but I made him marry Maral.
You're getting
good at this.
Do you remember
the French song we learned?
- Yes!
- Yes? Let's sing it.
- Who wants to lead?
- Me, me, me!
Hmm.
Mira.
Come on, let's go. Move!
I want to talk
to this man.
I thought I was being driven
to an unmarked grave.
What's going on?
You're being deported
to Malta.
How did you know I'd been captured?
Someone called the Embassy.
Thank you.
I have a request.
Can you contact a Reverend
Antreassian in Bassek
and find out if Ana Khesarian
and a group of orphans
reached there safely?
I'll do my best.
Good luck to you.
Thank you, sir.
Sir.
Lieutenant.
One moment.
Read that, Lieutenant Ogan,
your normal voice.
"I have important information.
"The reporter Chris Myers is
being held at Army Headquarters.
"He will...
He will be executed."
They're here.
Get the men together.
Surrender these weapons.
Come down,
or we will kill you all.
All we ask
is to live in peace here.
Hold fire. Hold fire!
Hold fire!
Hold the line! Hold the line!
Shoot him! Shoot him!
Fall back! Fall back!
Press here. Hard.
As hard as you can.
I found these tools
for you.
Give those to Susie, please.
And I need more alcohol.
Take these and boil them.
Fifteen minutes. All right.
The Turks will be back soon.
Tomorrow, at dawn,
we will climb higher.
Everything that cannot be
carried should be destroyed.
Livestock, carts.
If you cannot
carry it, burn it.
Here. I made you
some tea.
Thank you.
I couldn't do it.
I couldn't pull the trigger.
Pasha, the Armenians
ambushed us.
There were hundreds
of Armenian gunmen,
well armed,
with snipers positioned.
They appeared to be retreating,
so then... Enough!
Mobilize the third division
and the artillery.
Admiral.
Admiral Fournet?
I'm Christopher Myers
from the Associated Press.
I'm told that you plan
to investigate
the plight of the Armenians
on the Turkish coast.
That is
restricted information.
Would you permit me
to sail with you?
Why would I do that?
Well, if you want the United
States to join this war,
then the American public need
to know what the enemy is doing
and what you're doing
to fight them.
Everyone,
find a place to camp.
Thank you.
Marta, I have
some soup for you.
Marta?
Oh...
Dear Lord, take
your loving child Marta,
who endured all
with such bravery.
Take her into your care with as
much love as she gave to us.
- Amen.
- Amen.
We were always arguing.
We'd fight all the time.
She would fight more with me
than with my father.
I think it's because we are
the most alike.
My mama.
They're all gone now.
Yeva and I are all
that's left of my family.
I know
that it won't bring
any of them back,
but God help me,
I want revenge.
I don't care.
Hey. Hey.
Our revenge
will be to survive.
Fast! Run! Run! Run!
Run! Run! Run!
Fast as you can!
Everyone stay down!
Keep your head down!
Come!
Mira! Get on the rocks!
Get down! Stay down!
It's all right. You're all right.
Come, here!
Reverend, they say
the Turks will kill us all.
It's not true.
God will protect us, yes?
Let's pray together.
Dear Lord, the light of
all goodness and mercy,
please protect us
in our hour of need
and help us survive
these cruel times,
so we may once more
sing your praises.
A French battleship is
steaming toward the coast.
Tomorrow I want
a final assault.
Look, there!
Light the bonfires!
Get everyone down to the beach.
Easy. On my command.
Go, go, go!
To the beach!
Everyone, hurry!
Admiral, I need
to be there.
Hurry! Hurry, everyone!
Bring the children!
Have you seen children?
Have you seen children?
A group of orphans?
Ana...
Ana!
Chris?
Ana!
Oh, Chris!
Oh, thank God!
Oh, my God!
Where's Michael?
He's coming behind us.
Quickly, everyone,
come on!
Stay together. I'm going back to help.
Keep close to me.
Chris.
Michael.
You survived.
Thank God.
How can I help?
The people there,
help them down.
Thank you, Chris.
She's injured.
Michael!
Ana!
Michael!
Did you see Chris?
Yes. Yes. He's on his way down.
I love you. I love you.
Let me help you.
Get your leg up.
This will help.
Here, put this on.
All right,
put this on.
Put your hands up.
Help! Help!
Help us!
Hold on. Hold on.
Michael!
Ana! Ana!
Ana!
Ana!
Ana!
Ana!
Yeva!
Help!
Where's Ana?
Where's Ana?
Michael!
Michael!
Where is she?
Michael.
Michael.
There was nothing
that could be said.
Both of us had lost
the woman we loved.
The French took us
to a refugee camp in Egypt.
Chris arranged for US visas
for me, Yeva, and the orphans.
We lost Chris in 1938.
He died while reporting
on the Spanish Civil War.
I adopted Yeva,
finished my medical studies, and set up
a practice in Watertown, Massachusetts.
After the Japanese
attacked Pearl Harbor,
Yeva joined
the Women's Army Corp
and fell in love with a
young Marine lieutenant.
And on her wedding day,
the orphans joined us
in celebration.
A toast in Armenian.
May they return safely to us.
Cheers.
My darling Yeva told me
that her greatest wish
was that her parents
and our dear Ana were here.
I told her I know
that they are.
For sure, they are here.
And all of your parents
and all those families lost
in an attempt to wipe our nation
from the face of the Earth.
But we're still here.
We're still here.
