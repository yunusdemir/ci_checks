Doogie!
Douglas, I can't understand why
you're so angry.
We caught the fish.
Ha ha.
A good-sized critter,
I might add.
You just
don't get it, Dad.
I don't care.
I never wanted to come here.
What?
I could be in Palm Springs
with Wanda right now.
Instead,
I'm stuck out here--
Needs more butter.
...talking to the fish!
Butter.
More.
[Doorbell Rings]
Murray, get the door!
I've grown out
of these trips.
Butter.
[Muttering]
I don't want to be
the great white hunter.
Sorry to disturb you at this hour,
Mr. Seidenbaum,
but you have been
personally selected
to receive a most...
irresistible offer.
Giving me instructions
like I was still
a little boy.
I didn't realize
you felt like this.
I'm surprised you
didn't say anything before this.
Murray, what are you
doing back there?
Murray!
[Electronic Noise]
Aah!
[Burp]
My name is Darryl Knable.
I'm a normal kid
who led a pretty normal life...
until that night.
[Announcer]
It looks and feels natural,
whether you're
skimming the surf
or racing the wind
on a cruiser for two.
And remember,
we stand behind it.
I'm not only
the Hair Club President,
but also a client.
[Darryl] In describing my dad,
several names come to mind--
Bill Cosby, Alan Thicke,
the Brady Bunch father.
My dad watched
all of them.
In fact, he watched
anything on TVall the time.
They say
the average American
watches 7 1 / 2 hours
of TVa day.
If that's true,
there are two guys who never watch,
and my dad
took their times.
Perhaps I shall
one day.
You have some dispatches for me,
Captain?
I have some dispatches
for the queen.
Prepare to taste
Corsican steel.
Uhh!
Hi.
Hi.
It's late.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be up in a minute, honey.
[Swords Cross]
I'm thinking
of renting out
your side of the bed.
Huh?
Don't get me wrong.
I like TVjust as much
as the next person.
It's just there are
more things you can do with it
than only watch it.
For instance, you can
also make money with it.
We interrupt this broadcast
for a special report.
Young electronics
genius Darryl Knable
has just won
the Nobel Prize.
Oh, you dipstick.
For secretly videotaping
his sister Diane
French-kissing with
her boyfriend Chris.
We're talking
tongues here!
For copies of this tape,
send $3.00 to...
Darryl Knable,
1 532 Blue Jay Court--
Hey, Knable, your kid's messing up
my TV reception again.
And your dog's
messing up my dichondra.
Rivets didn't do that.
Then there's a brontosaurus
loose in the neighborhood.
Bad dog. Bad, bad doggie.
I'm going to call
the FCC!
The FCC!
[Snort]
My mom was a big-deal
advertising executive
with a vitamin company.
My dad had this real suck job
selling plumbing supplies.
I heard them
arguing one night,
and she said
he was suffering from
something called
a mid-life crisis,
whatever that is.
He said he wasn't.
She said he was jealous
of her success.
He said he wasn't.
They argued a lot.
Aah!
So that's my dad,
going to his
pretty normal home
after his pretty normal day
at his suck job,
ready to watch his TV.
That brings us to that night
I was talking about.
That's when
everything changed.
[Woof Woof]
I love you.
I don't care
who loves who--
I won't play
the sap for you.
You killed Miles, and
you're going over for it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you two going?
Mom, remember?
Oh, right. You're spending
the night with friends.
Diane...
no boys.
Mother,
I am not a child.
Mm-hmm. You go directly
to Tracy's, you understand?
Right.
Mom, you know my friend
Billy Stephan?
Mm-hmm.
Well, his dad
moved out for a while.
Then his parents went away
and sat in a hot tub all weekend.
When they got back,
Billy's dad moved back in
and things were all better.
Did you plan this so your dad
and I could be alone?
We don't know how much
that hip bruise he got--
Roy?
Hi, Helen.
I have an idea.
You know how proud
I am of you-- Pass it!
Let's go away.
Go ahead. I'll be there
in 4 minutes and 1 6 seconds.
Roy. Roy, listen.
Let's go away
like we used to,
to the mountains.
O.K.
Just the two of us.
No phones, no kids,
no TV.
No TV?
They don't have TV there.
Is there a plug?
This is abnormal.
Honey, you're just
shutting yourself off
from everything
and everybody.
Are you having problems?
Is--Is it me?
Yes! No.
Is--Is it work?
Are you having trouble at work?
Of course not.
What makes you say something like that?
Shoot, you idiot.
Shoot.
The one thing we always
promised each other
is that we would
remain honest.
We are honest
with each other.
Look...
you say
that I'm shut off,
that--that I can't
open up to you,
that I'm closed down.
O.K., well,
I'm going to
tell you something
that's--that's
very important to me.
I'm going to be
completely honest.
I just don't want you to
take this the wrong way.
Oh, Roy, talk to me.
I can take anything.
We're in double overtime here.
Fine!
Watch TV.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Could you move
just to--
This is unbelievable!
You couldn't listen to me
for two minutes
without that stupid television
being on!
When I married you,
you were a doer.
Now all you are
is a watcher!
[Announcer]
He gave it away to Drexler.
Drexler fouled
at mid-court.
Oh, Roy?
Huh?
Hyah--aah!
The TV!
[Paul Henreid]
I was afraid
you were keeping Tina
out of pity,
but that wasn't pity
just now.
Now I know
you still love me.
It won't die,
what's between us.
Do what you will--
Never happen.
ignore it,
neglect it--
No further developments
in the disappearance
of Murray and Sarah
Seidenbaum of Oakview.
Police are still baffled
and report they have no clues.
Ahhhh...
Roy...
your boring little life
is about to become
much more exciting.
[Doorbell Chimes]
Mr. Knable?
Sorry to disturb you
at this hour,
but you've been
personally selected
to receive a most
irresistible offer.
I'm busy.
Wait, Mr. Knable.
I have something you want--
escape...
from all your
failures and woes,
at the touch
of your thumb...
on this.
[Beeping]
Go ahead.
[Beeping]
Your new controller.
Your passport to the ultimate
television adventure.
Cute place.
You fence!
Oh, I used to.
Did you ever, uh,
kill anyone?
Of course not.
Look, Mr., uh...
Spike.
At your service.
What exactly is it
that you're selling?
Mmm! Attractive.
The little woman.
You two
having difficulties?
Well, I don't see how--
I know all about you, Roy.
Success, it's like a fly
buzzing around your head.
You reach for it,
you grab it,
and all you get is...
nothing!
You're tired
of nothing, Roy,
so you want to hide
from everything,
but she gives you heat,
right?
Roy, wait till she
gets a load of this--
600 and 66 channels
of heart-pounding,
skull-blasting
entertainment.
Comedy! Drama!
Hot-oil aerobics
like nothing you've ever seen,
brother.
Unlimited entertainment,
snatched from the ether
and slammed into your brand-new
44-inch,
900-line resolution,
3-way expanded-matrix,
Dolby stereo TV,
right here, Roy.
A new TV?
Straight from
the temple of high-tech.
Make this thing
look like a Philco.
Some people would give
their souls
for a system like this.
Just sign here.
We're in business.
I--I can't.
All right.
Good night, Mr. Knable.
Did I mention, uh...
free trial?
Free?
Well, Roy, all set for the TV
adventure of a lifetime?
Now remember...
you'll have to
adjust the dish
to fine-tune reception.
Like this.
Enjoy your new system,
Roy.
We'll be in touch.
Ha ha ha!
That was a dead end!
[Thunder]
[Spike]
Ha ha ha ha!
Hi.
Ho ho ho ho ho!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Aah!
Now, honey, just
keep an open mind.
There's no obligation.
I got it on a free trial.
It's a whole satellite system,
over 600 channels.
Wednesdays at 9:00...
The salesman said
we'd get a lot of shows
you can't get
on regular TV.
Helen?
Helen?
I don't want this anymore!
[Announcer]
We thought it would be funny,
if our Bob, dressed
as a policeman,
would tell
a perfect stranger
her husband is dead.
Mrs. Cecily Barth?
Yes.
Your husband's name
was Steven Barth?
Was?
What do you
mean, was?
Did your husband drive
a 1 978 Chevrolet Impala?
What are you saying?
Has something happened
to my Steven?
[Announcer]
Watch her reaction to the bad news.
I'm afraid so.
Ah! Aah!
[Weeping]
It's all right.
[Announcer]
I think it's time for Mrs. Barth
to be let in on the fun.
Mrs. Barth, look
across the street
at that van behind me.
Look really carefully.
Is that, uh...
It's a camera, yes.
Then...you mean...
Yes, Mrs. Barth.
You're on...
Sadistic Hidden Videos?
And you're...Bob.
Ha ha ha ha!
I'm on TV?
Uhh! Oh, you guys!
Oh!
The dish needs adjusting.
Ohh!
That'll improve
the reception!
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, Roy?
Well, how's this?
[Banging]
You receiving this?
Are you getting this?
Will you stop it?
I am leaving you, Roy.
[Beeping]
I want a man who'll touch me
rather than his remote control.
Please hang on
a second.
We have to talk!
It's too late
to talk!
Whoa!
Fasten your seat belts,
folks.
It's going to be
a bumpy ride!
Ha ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha.
And welcome back to...
- You Can't Win!
- You Can't Win!
Now let's welcome
our new contestants
Roy and Helen Knable!
Do you know
the rules of our game?
What game?
The game with these
great prizes.
Jay?
Feast your eyes on this--
the all-new
Nappa-crapper 9000.
You'll never have to
get off your fat butt again.
It has every amenity--
a built-in color TV.
It adjusts to you
so you don't have to move.
No more trips to the kitchen
during commercials.
Better yet, no more annoying
trips to the bathroom.
Your television viewing
never has to be interrupted,
and of course,
win or lose,
every contestant takes home
a set of Encyclopedia Satanica!
And now it's time to play...
You Can't Win.
Back to you, Guy.
Roy, the first question's
for you.
On your last
wedding anniversary,
you missed the romantic dinner
your wife had planned.
The reason,
A--Car trouble.
B--You were
running a marathon.
C--You were in a bar
swilling a beer,
watching...World Series.
Car trouble,
just like I said!
No! Can you take it?
You were watching
baseball?
That's right!
Trust me, babe.
You walked into the right place.
Very cushy down here.
You can cool your heels
in here for the rest of eternity
if you
kiss the right ass.
These lips ain't calloused
for nothing!
Ha ha ha ha!
Are you some kind
of comedian?
I once opened
for Liberace in Vegas.
Great.
This is
the Jumbotron.
It's got all the bells
and whistles.
It's our
official scoreboard.
Keeps track of the SBIs.
Souls batted in.
Ha ha ha.
Kind of a sports thing.
[Cough]
Time for the
Seidenbaums, sir.
Punch 'em up.
Mmm...
the Seidenbaums.
Yearning for
exotic locales.
This episode
takes them to Tokyo.
They're having
a wonderful time
starring in
their own movie.
It's the Seidenbaums
versus...
the gigantic
stinking-footed lizard!
Aah!
Ooh!
Sayonara, Mrs. Seidenbaum.
That's entertainment.
Oh, he's good.
He's so good.
Ha ha ha!
Shocking.
Sir, this is Pierce,
our new, uh, intern.
If you can't stomach
the sight of blood--
It's not the blood
I find distressing.
It's your lack
of subtext.
Film school graduate.
Yes, sir.
USC.
I did my thesis
on Kurosawa and Spike Lee.
Mr. Pierce, let me educate you
about our organization.
Here at Hellvision,
we've turned the process
of soul acquisition
into an entertainment
extravaganza,
and all for the benefit
of one very demanding viewer below.
The boss himself,
and I don't mean
Springsteen.
He has an enormous
appetite for misfortune.
It is our job to supply him
with an eclectic offering
of light amusements,
not subtext!
Don't go away, Knables!
It's time for...
the final question.
What's that mean?
- The pit!
- The pit!
Yes, the pit!
And what's down there
today,Jay?
Lots of slimy, crawly
bad things, Guy.
Eeeuw!
Now you have
1 0 seconds
to answer the question
correctly, or be...
eliminated.
Aah!
So the object's
to get to the end--
The object's to kill them
before the end.
Take the Knables,
for instance.
They just
checked in.
If they survive 24 hours,
they go back.
Part of our treaty
with the other side.
Kind of
a Geneva Convention
in the war
for souls.
Ha ha ha ha!
Name the person who's
recently been seeing
a former lover.
Is it,
A--Roy?
No.
B--Helen?
Or C--Roy and Helen?
I know, I know.
The former lovers we've
been seeing are each other!
You're...
right!
Aah!
We'll be back with
the Knables' vacation round
right after this!
How long do they
usually last?
Whether they go
quickly or not,
in the end,
they always join us.
You're forgetting that
wiry little Peruvian chap.
A mistake, Mr. Crowley,
that won't be repeated.
Hey, it wasn't me
that loused up.Jeez.
Are you implying
that if was my fault?
I'm kidding!
You know me.
Always joking.
I think, Mr. Crowley,
it's time for a little...field work.
Uh...
Spike.
Sir.
Uh...
Why don't I
take you to lunch?
We can sit down.
We can--
Oh, boy.
Hey, Spike,
come on.
You know me.
Heh heh heh.
Chronic foot-in-the-mouth
disease.
I don't want to
do field work.
I'm executive material.
I belong
here with you.
Aaahhh!
Screw up in here,
and you're dead meat...
dead meat.
Mr. and Mrs. Knable,
it's time to find out
where you go on
your fantasy vacation.
Door number 1
it is!
What is going on?
You're going on
the trip of a lifetime!
Aah!
[Bell Dings]
Ladies and gentlemen,
the main event--
mixed pairs wrestling.
No holds barred.
No transfusions allowed.
A battle to the death!
This has got to be
a dream.
It's a bad dream.
In this corner, Roy
''The Couch Potato'' Knable
and his wife
Helen the Harridan!
I gotta wake up.
And the challengers...
the vilest and evilest duo
ever to disgrace
a wrestling ring...
that ogre and ogress...
the Gorgons!
Rraahhhrr!
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.
Rraahhr!
Calm down. Stay calm.
Couch Potato, come on.
I--I think
he means us.
Excuse me.
We're not supposed to be here.
Rrraahhhr!
O.K. everything goes--
maim, murder each other,
I don't care,
but keep it clean.
When the bell rings,
kill or be killed.
Do we look
like wrestlers?
We have no idea
why we're here.
I'm a senior product manager
for a vitamin company.
Senior product manager?
I got a promotion.
Why didn't you tell me?
Roy, you know why.
Why?
Because my success
threatens you.
Your success
does not threaten me.
It does, too!
[Bell Dings]
Uh-oh.
I've watched enough
wrestling to know
it's all fake.
No one
ever gets hurt--
- Aaaahhhh!
- Rrraahhrr!
Rrraahhhr!
Roy!
Not fake.
It's not fake.
Run for your life,
Helen--quickly.
Helen, hold me...
Aah!
Aah!
Watch, Mr. Pierce.
See how it's done.
The exhilarating end
of a tedious life.
Grrr!
Get up. Get up!
Here comes that Gorgon girl
to finish the job.
Leave him alone,
you bitch!
Grrr!
I apologize.
You're probably really
not a bitch.
Roy, get up!
The Gorgon's
in the seats!
He's history!
Roy!
You know, for
a full-figured woman,
you really wear
that outfit well.
Help! Ow!
Whoa, Nellie! Cat fight!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
This could be the end.
Grrr!
My hair!
Looks like
that pathetic loser
isn't going to be
as easy as we thought.
Roy.
What happened?
We won.
Or rather, I won.
- Knables!
- Knables!
- Knables!
- Knables!
- Knables!
- Knables!
All right,
you won, too.
Damn right.
And your success
does not threaten me.
It does, too.
Totally wicked.
Excellent.
[Door Opens]
Where's Mom and D--
Oh, my God.
Dad must have gotten it
last night.
How did James Dean
really die?
Find out tonight on
Autopsies of the Rich and Famous.
The usual, sir?
Please.
[Ride Of The Valkyries
Plays]
Bizarre.
Welcome to
Northern Overexposure,
the story of a young doctor
from New York
who comes to Alaska,
complains about everything,
and freezes to death.
Hello! Yoo-hoo, Mister!
Stay away!
These are my holes!
Back off!
Oh, Knable,
it's only you.
How does he know
our name?
Trying to find
a conduit out of here.
Conduit?
Yeah. A window
to the next channel.
If you think I'm spending
the rest of eternity here,
you're crazy!
[Wolf Howls]
Here it is!
Here it is!
This is it!
[Growling]
The shack!
Aah!
Helen! Helen!
Hey, Mom and Dad
left us a note.
Give me that.
''Dear kids,
had to leave for a while.
Will call tomorrow
to explain.
Love, Mom.''
Killer!
The house to myself!
They did it.
They went away, just like
Billy's mom and dad did.
And now it's your turn
to go away, dweebnik.
Shelley, it's me.
Guess what?
[Beeping]
What are you doing?
Did you see that?
That dish,
it ate my BMX.
Is this some kind
of male puberty thing?
[Barking]
Let me get
this straight.
We've been sucked into
some kind of TV world?
Are you saying
that that salesman was--
Mr. Spike--
Mephistopheles
of the cathode ray,
big brother
to the ungrateful dead.
If we ever cross
channels again--Ho ho ho!
Roy, how could you?
I thought
I was buying a TV.
Oh! This is
just great.
This is great.
You wanted to live
in a TV fantasy?
You got your wish.
At least we're not dead.
Not yet.
Stay alive
another 1 5 hours--
Bingo. Free pass
back to reality.
The odds
of making it are--
[Crack]
Oh, my.
The cold's no place
for a stiff.
Oh, my God.
Don't panic.
I got us into this,
I'll get us out.
Your leadership skills couldn't
get us out of a t-shirt!
[Doorbell Chimes]
I'll get it!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Hi!
Hi. Come in.
I don't believe in
out-of-body experiences.
That's because you hold
your emotions back.
Do not.
What do you think
of this color?
That's all right.
I don't think it
really goes in here.
Clashes with the bars.
You can't really say
you're an expressive person.
What do you think
of this color here?
Clashes with the bars.
See? I told you.
Coming this fall...
These kids are
driving me crazy!
Wish there was some way
to shut them up!
[Announcer] For those long,
tedious car trips, you need...
the Silencer of the Lambs.
Driving will never
be the same.
Silencer of the Pets
sold separately.
It's...
My bike.
That's my bike.
You saw a bike
like yours on TV.
So what?
Not a bike
like my bike.
My bike! Come on.
Stop it!
Leave me alone.
Look, there's
something else.
I found this on the ground
near the dish.
Mom's watch.
It stopped at 1 0:30.
This is going to sound
totally crazy,
but I don't think
Mom and Dad went to the mountains
for the weekend.
Come on, Diane!
Look, I'm sure it's nothing
to worry about, O.K.?
Now leave us alone!
Diane, whatever you do,
don't go
in the backyard, O.K.?
Don't go
in the backyard!
If you'll excuse me,
I'm off
to warmer megahertz.
Going to find a channel
with sun,
funny drinks with
those little umbrellas,
and maybe a dog track.
All clear.
[Grrr]
Hey! Aah!
I'm already dead!
Save her!
We got to get
to that conduit!
Roy, it's getting worse!
Wait, wait, wait.
I got an idea.
Push! Come on, now.
There it is.
There it is!
Come on.
[Grrr]
Jump.
Jump?
Wherever it leads can't
be any worse than this.
Yeow!
Umph!
Couldn't be any worse,
huh, Roy?
Helen?
Oh, my God!
We're cartoons.
Boy, this is strange.
Strange? I'm
an animated rodent
wearing high-heeled
running shoes.
The word ''strange''
is somehow lacking.
At least we're safe here.
No one ever dies
in cartoons, right?
Ralph, I left
some food out.
I hope it doesn't
attract any mice.
Don't worry.
That new device is guaranteed.
No rodent stands
a chance in there.
Stay tuned.
How can you even think
of eating doughnuts
at a time like this?
Should I look for some oat bran?
I'm starved.
If you don't come down,
I'm leaving.
Where you going to go,
your cartoon mother's house?
I am warning you, Roy.
Roy?
Wow! These things are
as big as Buicks.
I'm gone.
That's it.
I said we're through,
and we are through.
I can do better
on my own.
I am not a mouse.
I'm Helen Knable.
I have an MBA.
I live at 1 53 2
BlueJay Court.
I have two
beautiful children--
who I may never
see again.
Mom?
Roy?
Warning--You are trespassing
in a human habitation.
The penalty is death.
My doctor was right.
Doughnuts will be
the death of me.
[Whistle Blows]
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Would you let go
of me?
You have to see this.
There.
This will work.
It worked on MacGyver.
What are you
talking about?
Can't you see?
It's Mom and Dad
in the cartoon.
Very funny, pus-head.
Diane, you've got to
believe me.
Kids, don't try
this at home.
I think we lost them.
What?
For a mouse,
you, um, look pretty sexy.
Too bad you didn't like
the way I looked
when I was human.
I always did.
News to me.
I'm sorry.
Surrender.
Come out with...
Look!
Roy, turn! Turn!
Helen, wait!
This is one clever pussy.
I've watched
enough cartoons.
How would
an animated character
handle this?
This will put a permanent
crease in his shorts.
[Doorbell Chimes]
Identify yourself.
Catnip-gram.
[Barking]
[Meow]
I'll never get out
of here.
Deeb-a-deeb-a-deeb--
That's all, folks.
I've lost the feeling
in my arm.
All of a sudden,
I can't see anything.
- Uhh!
- Oh!
Sundays at 8.:00...
it's...
Where did he go?
Duane's Underworld.
Duane's Underworld.
It's partytime! Excellent!
[Guitar Riff]
Welcome to Duane's Underworld,
O Father of Lies.
I'm your
excrement host Duane,
and with me as always is my
slightly decaying cohost Garf.
Wifto! Wifto!
Party eternally, Garf.
Party eternally,
Duane.
All right.
Today we have a special guest,
a man who can't even
sell plumbing supplies.
Shhyeah! Like no one
uses a toilet.
Mr. Roy Knable.
Salutations,
O mighty failure.
Mr. Knable,
before we get started,
tell me what you see
on this card.
I...war ship...satin?
Excrement.
Now, I understand
you're searching for
your lovely wife Helen...
who I truly believe
you will find,
because good always
conquers over evil...
- Not!
- Not!
In order to assist you
in your efforts,
we have located
a photograph of your wife
to show our viewers.
Where did that
come from?
She's a vixen,
Mr. K.
Beezle-babe! Tent pole!
Lady Knable,
we salute you.
- Schwing!
- Schwing!
And your daughter's
pompoms,
they're delectable,
too, man.
You creeps!
Uh-oh. Extreme close-up
on Mr. Knable.
- Oh!
- Oh!
Excellent.
One more time!
Man,
I'm getting dizzy.
I could hurl.
No. Chew it back, man.
Now the red-hot-poker-
in-the-eye cam.
Bogus.
I'm black and white.
Hello. Testing, testing.
''Roy Knable,
private dick. ''
Well, better than being
a public dick.
O.K., I'm in some old movie.
Must be on cable.
I've been watching
these things my whole life.
I should know
what to do.
Be like Bogart, like in
The Maltese Falcon.
I'm on a case.
I got to find Helen.
Got to find the clues.
Got to find out
how to use this thing.
[Intercom Buzzes]
Mr. Knable,
you've dropped your gun again.
I know!
[Knock On Door]
Roy, is that you?
Sir...great news.
Your new class
of recruits--
We've taken possession
of all of them,
except two, sir.
Oh! I know that,
you postulating putz!
They've just been lucky,
that's all.
Have they?
You know, the strain
of your job
must be tremendous.
Ever considered
taking a vacation,
letting someone else take
the burden off your shoulders?
Someone else?
You?
I'm flattered
you'd even think
I could fill
your shoes.
But I'm ready
to try, sir.
[Announcer] And now...get
in shape with The Exorcisist.
Come on, people,
let's get in shape.
Come on.
Make it burn.
Feel it burn.
[Explosion]
Good, Doreen.
O.K., everybody,
head spins.
With me.
Ready, go.
Very good.
Very nice.
I like it.
O.K., that's good.
Cool down.
Shake it out.
O.K., now vomit.
[Announcer] Kids, now there's
a new beerjust for you.
It's got no alcohol,
but it'll make you
act just like Dad.
[Burp]
Give me another one, babe.
That's my boy.
Yogi Beer. You'll be
just like your dad.
[Channel Changer Beeps]
Dad?
[Voices]
Get away
from the dish.
Darryl, what
is with you?
Get lost.
[Beep]
[Beep]
[Beep]
5, 6, 7, 8.
5, 6, 7, 8.
5, 6, 7, 8.
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Darryl,
what are you doing?
Darryl!
Oh, my God!
Guys, wait! It's not my fault
my brother's a creep!
[Door Slams]
Darryl!
Darryl!
Darryl!
You're pizza topping!
Wait. Mom and Dad
are here.
They're home?
Well, not exactly.
Look.
See? That's Dad.
That is not dad.
Mom?
That looks like Mom.
It is mom. That's what
I've been trying to tell you.
Our parents are trapped
in television.
Oh, wow.
''Classy dame vanishes.
Last seen
at Club Seidenbaum. ''
Helen.
Seidenbaum.
That name is famil--
Oh, my God.
Murray Seidenbaum.
He lives
right near me.
He borrowed
my lawn mower.
[Beep Beep Beep]
Obviously,
we're dealing with something
of a supernatural
nature here, Diane.
I mean, this thing,
it did not come from Radio Shack.
Yeah, so you're the smart one.
Think of something.
O.K., um...
what goes in a dish
and winds up on TV?
My bike...
our parents...
Follow me.
Hey, not my stereo.
I need the parts.
Go downstairs
and watch them.
Keep track of them.
Ho ho.
Nice work, boys.
Glad you could
join me, Mrs. Knable.
Didn't have
much choice.
Lobster?
Drink.
Where's my husband?
Why worry about him?
I ditched my wife
five channels ago.
She happened to meet the business end
of a 50-ton reptile.
And I can tell you,
I don't exactly miss
dried meat loaf.
This is great here.
Great.
I don't ever want
to get out.
Outside, I was
Murray the doormat.
In here...
Boss Seidenbaum.
Brought my remote
in with me.
Gets too hot--Bam,
I'm on another channel.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Oh!
- Oh!
You're not coming
in here!
Euh! Euh!
Ahhh!
Well, look
who showed up.
Where's my--
Hello, Roy.
Helen,
you're all right.
You--
You look terrific!
Oh, really?
Hey, Seidenbaum!
I'm taking over your business!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
- Aah!
Seidenbaum.
Knables.
All I wanted was to be
the big shot for once.
Take my remote.
Get out of here.
You two still got a chance
of making it together.
There it is!
No, no, stay down.
This is my job.
Piece of cake.
O.K., ready?
[Channel Changer
Beeps]
[Neigh]
Oh, my God.
I lost them.
The next item we have
for you on the...
Dad, where are you?
And now the all-new miniseries
about the French Revolution...
the story of
the Marquis de Knable,
an enemy of the people,
who wears a disguise
to escape the guillotine.
It's an epic drama of love,
danger, and cross-dressing.
Roy.
You have boobs.
Oh, they're not mine.
[Shouting In French]
Psst! Hey, Knables.
Nice disguise.
Crowley?
Interesting concept,
diagonal boobs.
Could you fix
that thing?
Thought the wolves
got you.
Tell you something
about wolves--
Vicious?
Goes without saying.
But not that bright.
While those dumb bunnies were
fighting over my appendages,
I managed to escape.
Liberte, citizen.
Vive la France!
Power to the people!
Ha ha ha ha!
Come on.
Personally,
I think he's losing it.
What a pathetic
thing to watch.
Only 2 hours left,
and your 24 hours are up.
All you got to do
is lie low.
[Speaking French]
Les cops.
Les cops.
Inside.
Inside.
I'll find a conduit
out of here.
Bonjour. Nice day
for an execution, non?
[The Marseillaise Plays]
Stay tuned for the final chapter of
Off With His Head,
when the Marquis de Knable
finally loses his.
Uh-oh.
Darryl!
We got to jam.
[Beep Beep]
Merci.
Well, we've always
wanted to go to Paris.
In the 20th century.
Since we're here, we might as well
make the best of it.
Make the best of it?
This is the French
Revolution.
People are trying
to kill you.
If we get out of this,
things will be different.
I won't just be
a watcher.
I'll be the man I was
when we first met.
You weren't blond then,
and you wore a lot less makeup.
[Darryl]
Aim it at the center of the dish!
You are both
under arrest!
For what?
For being
too beautiful
and without
proper escort.
Ha ha ha!
Garcon,
more wine!
[Beep Beep]
O.K. TV's connected
to the dish.
Now we go
for contact.
There's no interference.
Nothing's getting through.
We need more power.
I'm going to cop
some juice.
Be careful.
This woman is not
who you think.
She is wanted.
Of course she's wanted,
you fool!
By me!
My cherie...
you inflame me.
I never kiss
on the first date.
Oh?
- Ooh!
- Naughty boy.
This has been a kick,
fellas, but we've got to go.
No, no!
Come back here, sweetheart!
Keep your hands
off her!
Your hair's so beautiful.
May I have a lock of it?
I--
- Oh!
- Oh!
Why don't you keep
the whole thing?
I tried
to tell you!
It's the Marquis
de Knable!
Enemy of the people!
I knew that!
Marquis de Knable...
the guillotine awaits!
I would have
given you chocolates.
[Beep Beep]
Kill the marquis!
Kill the marquis!
I'm telling you,
I'm not a marquis!
I sell plumbing supplies
in Seattle...
Washington!
[Grrr]
Roy!
Roy! Roy!
I love you.
You guys are making
a big mistake.
I'm not even a member
of this country!
Darryl, you'd
better hurry up!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
Kill the marquis!
Hi, fellas,
I loved you in Star Wars.
Can we just talk
for a second?
Oh, my God. Holy--
Oh! Could we--
[Grrr]
[Woof]
[Grrr]
[Shouting]
Any last requests?
Yeah. How about the long version
of Stairway to Heaven?
I'm afraid that is
not where you are going.
Darryl!
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Grrr]
[Woof]
[Grrr]
Here, catch!
Wait! An innocent man's
blood is being spilled!
Good point.
Better back away.
This one, he could
be a gusher.
By order of the court...
Looks like Spike's going to make
his quota after all.
I deliver the Marquis
de Knable's soul
to its rightful owner!
Finally, he's mine.
How come he dresses
like a woman?
I do that sometimes.
Kill the marquis!
Dad, can you hear me?
Darryl? My God!
God?
Yes!
It's...
God!
Right, God?
Tell the infidels
to release him.
What's an infidel?
I don't know.
Tell them
to release him!
Tell them!
Um...um...release
the marquis.
You heard him.
Get me out of this.
What's happening?
[Beep Beep]
Who's messing
with my programming?
[Beep Beep Beep]
You--the weenie
in black--
You, dork--
at the wheel--
Yeah, you!
Release him!
I am the voice of--
- Ohhh...
- Oh, Roy!
We beat Spike!
We did it!
I would have given an arm
and a leg to see this!
In fact,
I already did!
- Ha ha ha!
- No, it's...
not possible.
[Beep Beep Beep]
[Alarm Warbling]
Sir. Speaking
for the staff...
we'll all miss your kind words
and inspiring leadership.
Ducker, contracts--
What?
There was a protest
filed on the Knable case.
A verbal contract binds only those
parties personally making the agreement.
Therefore, the contract can
only be for one person.
You took two.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes! Yes! Oh!
Mmm!
Oh, you're the ugliest bitch
in perdition,
but you gave me
a beautiful idea.
Discharge
Mr. Knable.
But, sir...
The contract
was for him only.
Masterful stroke, sir.
I don't get it.
They should've zapped
you two home by now.
You heard me...
discharge Mr. Knable.
Roy?
Roy!
- Oh!
- Oh!
[Darryl]
Dad!
[Diane]
Dad!
Where's your mother?
My obligation is limited to those
I have a contract with.
I fulfilled my end
by discharging Mr. Knable.
His wife is still--
Those who trespass into the system
are on their own.
We'll sort out
the bodies later
after I kill them both.
How can we be sure
he'll come back?
Because he loves her.
He's a puss.
Oh, and I'll be back,
in case anyone's
feeling ambitious.
Well, time
to rock 'n' roll.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Crowley.
Quite a radical wight-loss plan
you've been on.
Yes. Ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha.
But, uh...feeling
a lot, uh, better.
Ha ha ha!
Aah!
Hello, Mrs. Knable.
Mr. Spike,
at your service.
Where's my husband?
I'll take you to him.
Rahrr.
- Oh!
- Oh!
- Oh!
Howdy, ma'am.
Reckon the 3:1 0 to Yuma
will be along any minute.
Funny thing, though...
it don't exactly stop here.
You're going to hit me
with a train?
What can I say?
I'm a sucker for a big ending.
You sadistic bastard.
Runs in the family.
My father was
an oil company president.
Well...have a good day,
Mrs. Knable.
[Beep]
This just in...
Helen Knable
has been kidnapped
and taken to Channel 1.
We take you there live.
Roy, wherever you are,
get your butt back here!
Unfortunately,
her gutless failure of a husband
won't lift a finger
to save her.
Right, Roy?
No.
Dynamite. He's going to hit me
with a train and blow me up?
Roy!
I want you both
to stay inside.
Make sure those doughnuts
are ready.
I'll be very hungry
when I get back.
O.K.?
[Darryl]
Careful, Dad.
[Theme From The Good,
The Bad, And The Ugly Plays]
[Cough]
[Cough Cough]
[Cough Cough]
[Cough]
[Cough]
Help!
Helen?
Roy!
Back to play
the hero, huh?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Not exactly
typecasting.
Be about 6...6'1 ''.
Yeah.
Make your move,
tinhorn.
Today, Roy!
No!
- Dad!
- Dad!
[Beep Beep]
[Beep Beep]
You missed me,
partner.
Captain, the ship
has found itself
in an orbit
around hell.
The underworld
is hailing us.
I know you.
Greetings,
Captain Roy.
Our remotes
are synchronized,
so wherever
you go, I go.
Enjoy the attack.
[Alarm Warbling]
Lieutenant?
Captain?
G-G...Get us
out of here!
No!
Phasers on, uh...
torture.
Holy Shatner!
And just to show you
how effective
our passenger
restraint system really is,
watch this demonstration
at 1 1 0 miles an hour,
where our driver dummy
has the benefit
of seat belt
and air bag,
the other dummy
having neither one.
Neither one?
I can't watch.
Switch to Mom.
Switch to Mom!
[Train Whistle Blows]
Dad'll save her.
[Beep Beep]
Aah!
Ooh. Rrr!
No! No, wait!
Aaaaaahhhhh!
Hey, lady, watch out!
Ooh.
Whoop.
Aah!
Yaaahhhh!
Whoa!
Unh! Ahh!
Where have you been?
Aaaaaahhhh!
[Cough Cough]
My, my.
Now you'll never
get back to Kansas.
En garde.
Oh, no sword.
Have to talk
to that prop man.
Right about now,
your wife is probably
catching that train...
right between the eyes.
And you let it happen.
Here it comes, Dad!
I've taken
loads of souls...
and none more pathetic
than yours, Roy.
Say good night, Gracie.
Not yet.
You see, I was captain of my
junior college fencing team.
All right. Co-captain.
I gave you escape
from your pitiful life.
I want it back.
All sales are final.
Not this one.
Wait.
O.K. You got
the remote. You win.
But how about--
Just pitching here--
you and me
working together?
We could come up with
dynamite programming.
Chairman'd love it.
Knock him
off his hooves.
We'd be number one.
Of course, we are
the only one, but--
You don't get it,
do you?
Without me, you
don't get out of here.
Sorry, Spike.
You're cancelled.
Roy!
Deactivate
escape frequencies.
What are you doing?
I've trapped them.
It's not working!
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
Turn it off.
What do you do when you want
the TV to go away?
You turn it
off!
We've lost them.
Helen...
we're home!
Kids!
- Oh!
- Dad!
Oh! Oh!
[Dog Growls]
Whoever left the gate open
is grounded for a week.
[Woof]
Check that.
Whoever left the gate open
gets double their allowance.
Look at that.
Wetzel!
Don't get me angry,
you worm!
Get me out of here!
Put a lid on it, Fido.
O.K., Pierce,
what do you want?
Corner office?
Name on the door?
Hello, Spike.
Heh heh.
Crowley.
You know, you're a gentleman
and a scholar...
a fine
corporate asset...
a man who I, personally,
like very much.
Oh, incidentally, Spike,
nice of you to drop in.
Ha ha ha ha...
Ah...that's funny.
Ah!
Aah!
[Woof Woof]
I get his parking space.
So what can I tell you?
My parents
got back together.
The only TVmy dad
watches is 60 Minutes,
and he started
a new job.
I guess you could call us
a pretty normal family.
That's if anything
is ever normal.
Who on Earth
taught you that?
Uh, I saw it
on TV somewhere.
Some old movie.
Take my advice, kiddo.
Don't watch too much TV.
It can get you
into trouble.
O.K., fencers.
Class dismissed.
