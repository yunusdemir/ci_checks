<i>Back then,</i>
<i>this is years ago,</i>
<i>I couldn’t afford secrets.</i>
<i>I just had chores.</i>
<i>As a child,</i>
<i>growing up,</i>
<i>we had been rich.</i>
<i>And then...
well...</i>
<i>we weren’t.</i>
<i>And like most people
during the Depression,</i>
<i>I now lived each day
as it came,</i>
<i>no longer expecting anything.</i>
<i>Waiting --</i>
<i>for nothing.</i>
<i>And then...</i>
Hello?
Yes.
What??
Sh-sh!!
Be quiet.
Sinus?
Somebody die?
No. No one Mom...
Good Morning Miss Dayse.
<i>I wasn’t the first relative</i>
<i>his Mother called that day.</i>
<i>Maybe not even the tenth.</i>
<i>But I was around.</i>
<i>His Mother said he needed someone</i>
<i>to take his mind off his work.</i>
<i>Why she thought I could do that,</i>
<i>I had no idea.</i>
I suppose he’s related
to half of everybody up here.
We’re fifth --
or sixth cousins.
Depends on how you count...
Cigarette?
No. No, I don’t.
<i>I figured I’d spend the afternoon there,</i>
<i>and after having thoroughly
bored him to death,</i>
<i>go back</i>
<i>to my quiet life.</i>
<i>taking care</i>
<i>of my act</i>
<i>But was not what happened</i>
He's not been feeling well.
Sinuses.
Seems to happen every time,
the second he comes home.
Mr. President?
Daisy.
What a rare treat.
I hope my mother
didn't force this on you.
She said everyone else
was away.
Did she?
She shouldn’t have said that.
How nice to see you.
How long has it been?
Oh, years.
The Dows’ wedding, sir.
In Rhinebeck?
Oh, were you there?
Where would you like me to sit?
There’s tea...
I think there’s still tea.
Will you..?
I can do this because
my mother's not here.
She doesn’t believe
in sinus medicine...
Do you collect stamps,
Daisy?
I - don't.
Come and look at these...
I suppose you’ve met
pretty much
everyone of these...
Not every one.
Not yet.
Excuse me,
I should have knocked.
I actually wrote this?
My cross, Daisy,
is that I am too nice.
But --
we need the Senator’s vote.
Don’t we?
Why can’t politicians
just be honest?
My cousin.
Those are from Africa.
They say that's the highest
waterfall in the world.
Would you like me to go?
No. Please.
I wouldn’t.
This one’s pretty.
I’d like to go there.
Where is that?
Well.
To be honest,
I’d like to go almost
anywhere.
<i>In Europe there would certainly be</i>
<i>another war,</i>
<i>one we would be dragged into,</i>
<i>whether we liked it or not.</i>
<i>Here at home,</i>
<i>the country is still
in a depression</i>
<i>people out of work</i>
<i>Hungry</i>
<i>needing help</i>
<i>the President
spent an awful lot</i>
<i>of time that spring
in Hyde Park On Hudson.</i>
Fellows, one of you
please tell Mother --
that this is radio?
<i>He said --</i>
<i>I helped him forget --.</i>
<i>-- ‘the weight of world’.</i>
thirty seconds
look at me...
I think that means you,
Mother.
<i>His Mother said he’d run the whole</i>
<i>country from here if he could.</i>
<i>But he couldn’t.</i>
<i>Not with how things were --</i>
<i>Everyone knew someone
who couldn't find a job</i>
the first duty of government
<i>Everyone scared.</i>
is to protect the economic welfare
of all the people
and in all groups...
I said...
if private enterprises
does not provide jobs this spring
government will take up
the flag
we have all learned the lesson
that government cannot afford
to wait
until it is lost the power to act.
therefore I've sent a message
of reaching a prop to the congress
<i>And everyone looking to him.</i>
<i>They all wanted something from him.</i>
<i>The local labor union,</i>
<i>the Hyde Park Chamber of Commerce,</i>
<i>the German-American Friendship Band.</i>
<i>And all he wanted --</i>
<i>was to relax.</i>
<i>Each time he came home,</i>
<i>he’d telephone and ask:</i>
<i>Daisy where would you like
to go today?</i>
<i>And I would always answer --</i>
<i>‘anywhere.’</i>
<i>His wife, he said,</i>
<i>didn’t like to take drives.</i>
<i>I learned the names of birds and trees</i>
<i>I’d seen my whole life.</i>
<i>We drove along country roads,</i>
<i>up hills,</i>
<i>through woods,</i>
<i>through fields.</i>
<i>we drove down roads
I never knew the existence.</i>
<i>Roads later...
I couldn't find by my own.</i>
<i>He’d had the car built</i>
<i>so it could be driven</i>
<i>with just the hands.</i>
In some ways it's smoother
than the regular car
Do you like to drive?
<i>I believe I helped him
to forget the world</i>
<i>As we just</i>
<i>run away</i>
<i>And then,
one day...</i>
Where’s the police car going?
Oh, they don't follow all the time.
Sometimes they have to go
and catch a crook or something,
I suppose.
We've not been here before?
No.
I've been saving this.
I like this song.
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry.
I’m--
I’m the one who should apologize...
<i>I knew,</i>
<i>that we were now --</i>
<i>not just fifth cousins --</i>
<i>but very good friends.</i>
As soon as I can get away.
<i>time passed.</i>
<i>Time measured now</i>
<i>in Franklin’s visits to hyde park.</i>
Who was that?
The President wishes to see me.
And he’s the President.
He wishes to show me a new stamp.
Where are we going?
I don't know.
I had it built.
It's where I’ll retire.
I’ll write those detective books
I'm always talking about.
go, take a look...
go on...
There's no better place
to smell it
It’s heaven!!
I have been thinking, Daisy...
What?
What have you been thinking?
I’d like to--.
To share
with you --
this.
When I go away...
You know I
have to go ...
away.
Should you ever miss me...?
Do you ever miss me?
I always do.
Always.
A place to come.
And be alone.
And miss me...
Oh!
I am sorry!
Sorry.
That's all right!
<i>By now everyone was used to me.</i>
<i>I was the cousin
who’s always visiting.</i>
<i>No one ever even asked me
why that was.</i>
Has he read this?
I believe he has.
"If one could choose,
from all possible
British personalities,
the two who might make
the best impression upon Americans --
King George
and Queen Elizabeth
would not even
make the short list."
How dare they talk
about Royalty like this!
<i>No King of England
had ever visited America before.</i>
<i>But now he was coming --</i>
<i>to Hyde Park on Hudson.</i>
<i>and the only quiet place
left to work was outside</i>
What are those for?
He has a headache.
You do?
His sinuses again.
Happens this time every year.
I know that.
You didn’t say anything
about a headache.
He's not going to trouble you
with everything, Missy.
You have enough on your plate.
What does that mean?
It means --
you take very good care of me.
It means that you do too.
Mrs Roosevelt,
we appear not to have enough plates.
What?
We don't have enough plates.
Someone miscounted.
You tell me this now?
Mrs Astor has called again.
Franklin warned us,
Mrs Astor will have plates.
We'll borrow hers.
<i> today,</i>
<i> stay out of Mother’s way.</i>
On second thought --
we shall call for cook.
Mrs Astor is so rich,
she doesn’t know what she has.
<i>Franklin's wife,
Eleanor.</i>
I’m just doing what I’m told.
So much for your little secret...
- Good morning, Mother.
- Good Morning. Eleanor.
We are not going to serve
the King of England -
a cocktail!!
Your Mother has now told me
for the tenth time --
not to call her Royal Highness --
Elizabeth.
She’s told me that too.
I mean, please --
what century is this?
Daisy?
Daisy?
Oh yes.
She told me the same thing.
I told her
who did she think I was?
I think she knows.
Daisy?
Hello!
You’re just staring.
I’m not.
I wasn’t.
What do you want?
Eleanor’s just brought out fresh coffee.
She was asking if you’d like any.
She’s staring again.
I’m not.
Missy, Leave her alone.
My husband lives for the adoring eyes
of young women.
We know this.
Let’s change the subject,
shall we?
Don’t tell me
you’re embarrassed.
That day,
I would like to see.
I didn’t say I was embarrassed.
Why do we care what a ‘king’ or
‘queen’ thinks about us?
Real rosewood.
Still got the smell.
Is that why it cost so much?
Hick called.
For this morning's Royal visit
she'd been ordered to produce
five thousand children overnight.
What? Why?
m                                                                       m
As buffers for holding back
the crowds.
No.
The Girl Scouts refused outright--.
Good for them.
They said their girls had taken
an awful beating in DC!
So she finally got some Boy Scouts!
But when they were pushed,
they pushed back!
Started something
like ten fist fights!
When she finally got back
to her office,
she kicked off her shoes,
opened her window
and shouted out:
‘God damn the King and Queen!”
we’ll maybe saying
the same thing tomorrow!
<i>‘Hick’ was short for Lorena Hickock.</i>
<i>One of those friends
of Eleanor’s Franklin called --- </i>
<i>"she men."</i>
<i>People said their marriage
was troubled and unhappy.</i>
<i>That they lived mostly
separate lives.</i>
<i>But I never saw that.</i>
<i>That’s now how they seemed
when they were together.</i>
<i>We ended it up</i>
<i>And stated our last hope
for refuge.</i>
We must remind ourselves
that these kings and queens or whatever--
are no better than us.
They’re just people.
I read that in your column,
Eleanor.
Are you all right?
You look in pain.
- He has a sinus infection.
- He gets them --
this time of year.
Oh does he?
I didn’t know that.
I took an aspirin.
They just left Beacon.
Good!
won’t be too long.
Hick says I should get a month of
columns out of this weekend.
Hick says this King hates
his brother.
There’s a column right there.
His brother’s met with Hitler.
That's good.
There’s another column...
And this is the family we’re having
to our home for the weekend.
you don’t even live here.
I am staying the night.
Besides, I told your mother.
I thought the brother
gave up being king
so he could marry
the woman he loved.
Daisy, have you ever met a man
who would do that?
Hick says she thinks
the brother
might be positioning himself
to be the savior
of the monarchy,
once England
has been defeated
and the fascists
have taken over. Of course.
He’s young, Eleanor
So is she.
They’re both young.
Now let's just give them a break.
Can we?
<i> And all the wild, the king and queen
were getting close.</i>
Should we stop
and meet some people.
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
But...
We've just left...
We're almost there.
I don't think there are
any more towns until...
It's just a country road now.
Still...
He wants a cigarette.
We don’t want to be e-e-e-arly.
No. No we don’t.
And I'd like to meet some Americans.
Doesn't he want to meet you?
He's busy.
I know how important this is.
You’re not going
to let the side down.
Don’t worry.
That is what I’ve been
telling myself too.
You started to talk
about the weekend's itinerary.
You will be staying
in the Roosevelt house.
In fact,
it is the President's mother's house,
and she will officially
be your hostess.
Where is the President's house?
This is where he lives.
When he's not in Washington.
With his m-m-mother?
He doesn't have a house?
He has a room.
And his wife?
She lives in another house.
Hers.
And he doesn't--?
Which she shares with other --
women.
Who make furniture.
I’m sorry?
Furniture. They make it.
Build it.
They're couples.
They're the sort
who like each other.
The Ambassador's wife,
after having visited Hyde Park...
Why do they call it that?
- What?
- Hyde Park, is in London.
It's confusing to me.
I don't know.
Our Ambassador's wife wrote -
and I think you need to hear this.
She wrote
"It is a dismal house,
extremely badly run,
and most uncomfortable."
## I don't want to set
the world on fire
## I just want to start
a flame in your heart
## In my heart...
<i>Half of his cabinet
had been against the visit.</i>
<i>The country, they said,</i>
<i>was in no position</i>
<i>to take sides in another
European War.</i>
<i>So Franklin invited them here</i>
<i>where,
out of the spotlight,</i>
<i>we could all relax
and just be ourselves.</i>
## I've lost all ambition
for worldly acclaim
## I just want to be
the one you love
## And with your admission
that you feel the same
## I'll have reached the goal
I'm dreaming of
## Believe me
## I don't want to set
the world on fire
## I just want to start
a flame in your heart
<i>Looking back,</i>
<i>I now see how important
this day was,</i>
<i>to them,</i>
<i>to us,</i>
<i>to the world.</i>
<i>And of course --</i>
<i>as it turned out,</i>
<i>to me.</i>
Oh, what lovely ships.
My son built them
when he was a boy.
How very clever.
Wasn’t that clever?
T-t-terribly clever.
He also did the birds...
as a boy.
Until the taxidermy smells
made him ill.
He’ll tell you about it.
I shall look forward to that.
## I don't want to set
the world on fire
## I just want to start
a flame in your heart
Come in. Please,
I can't tell you,
how I am awfully of this.
My Mother, hasn't spoken
of nothing  else for months..
Hei, Daisy!
Mr. Cameron’s with the embassy --
this is Daisy.
Hello!
How do you do?
How do you do?
<i>That day, the President,
sent me upstairs on a mission...</i>
<i>to spy...</i>
<i>behind enemies lines.</i>
Charming.
Look at that view.
You must tell me
about everything.
That's --
the field.
We have fields
just like that.
Those hills --
lead down to the river.
So that's where they go.
What are you doing?
I came to see
if I could be any help.
Do you mind
if I call you Elizabeth?
No.
No.
So these are the beds --
your friend made?.
Those are them.
Not bad.
Not bad.
Is my wife behaving herself?
Yes!
Has my mother calmed down?
She’s fine!
It’s like a madhouse.
Don’t worry.
All quiet on the upstairs front.
He's definitely younger
than I'd imagined.
For a King,
you know....
Is he...
And they both seem nervous.
That surprised me.
Without some help from us,
Daisy --
there soon might
not be an England --
to be King of.
So I’d be nervous too.
Anyway,
that’s why they’re here.
Damn it.
Let me do it.
Let me do it.
They seem very nice people.
Smell like Martini.
Later tonight,
after the dinner and all that is over,
what do you say,
you and I get out of here?
J                                                                        J
Go someplace quiet.
I think I’ll need that.
Well --
I think I’m free.
It’s going to be a big,
big success.
Oh -- it's you.
We share a bath.
So I was t-t-told.
So we don't have to go
through the...
Yes.
What were you looking at?
These prints.
I just told
the President's mother
how humorous I found them.
What are they of--?
British soldiers.
The 1812 War.
Cartoons actually.
Mocking them.
Us.
They put you in a room with--?
The mother tried to apologize.
I told her
I found them funny.
She said she tried
to remove them,
but her son insisted.
Why would he do that?
What was he trying to say?
I don't know.
I don't know.
He knows this is important.
He knows why we’re here.
May I have a drink too?
How many have you had?
The mother just left.
Cheers.
She apologized for everything.
For Eleanor m-m-mostly.
And for the hot dogs.
Hot dogs?
What are you talking about,
Bertie?
It appears that
at the picnic tomorrow--.
There's a picnic tomorrow?
In our honour.
You hate picnics.
At the picnic,
the President's wife
has organized
that hot dogs be served
as our main dish.
I gather she's even publicized
this in the column she writes.
Are they trying to make fun of us?
I d-d-don't kn-kn-know.
What do you think?
You’re not going to tell Mother,
are you, Mary?
Not a soul, sir.
<i>Mary, we all knew,</i>
<i>was one of Mother’s spies.</i>
<i>Mother had spies them too.</i>
These are revolting.
They make our seamen
look like monkeys.
I can't believe he thought
these would make you laugh, Bertie.
I 'laughed'.
They're trying to make us seem --
common.
Your brother would never
have stood for this.
I'm sorry,
but he wouldn't.
I th-th-think if we j-j-just
ignore the-the-these--.
Please, stop stuttering!
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean it,
Bertie.
I think I have a headache.
My face feels hot.
Feel sorry.
I am not my brother.
Thank God for that.
And you are not
the D-d-duchess of Windsor.
You are better than that.
I just hate to see you...
See me...?
Laughed at.
<i>Mother,</i>
<i>who had a sixth sense
for sniffing out alcohol,</i>
<i>was on the warpath.</i>
<i>Mother’s father had been
a nasty drunk.</i>
Is he coming down?
What is that doing
in here?
Leave it, Mother.
I thought we had agreed.
That's not true.
I'm not going to serve
the King and Queen of England --
Dammit, I said -- leave it!!
close the door. Daisy.
m                                                                         m
Why are you shouting?
I am not shouting!
Close the door, Daisy!
Should I stay?
Just close it.
He's brought out the drinks tray,
Eleanor.
Franklin, you promised.
As I said to Mother,
that's not true.
Maybe after dinner!!
Don’t shout, Mother.
J                                                                          J
We have guests.
I know we have guests!
And I know who they are!
And my son is not going
to serve them cocktails!
They’re my guests!!
It’s my house!!
You’re the one
who wants us to live here.
Eleanor, please,
don’t-- remember that.
Give me the tray.
Isn’t it true?
No. Yes.
I’m the President!!
Oh! Just stop this!
Stop this.
You behave like a child!!!
I have the programme
for tomorrow's
'event.'
This is for the hot dog picnic?
There will be entertainment
as well.
Perhaps I should be surprised.
Indians.
No.
"Ish-Ti-Opi."
What???
He's called here
"The Indian Baritone."
So he's going to sing.
There's "Princess Te Ata."
She is going to show us
"The Indian Corn Ceremony."
Oh god.
"Accompanied by Kurkus Pahitu
on the Tom-Tom."
There's our incentive
not to be hungover.
The 'tom-tom.'
'Hot dogs.'
'Cartoons of British naval officers
as monkeys.'
Come in.
The President is waiting for you
in his study,
your Majesty.
He said it was time for --
‘children’s hour.’
Drinks.
And the Queen?
She's been allowed more time to relax.
Here we go...
Good luck!
Sir, my Mother does not approve
of cocktails.
And thinks you might rather have
a cup of tea.
M-m-my m-m-mother would have said
the s-s-s-same thing.
Actually I-I-I-I-I prefer a-a-a-a...
... cocktail.
A man after my own heart...
So she said:
‘I’m so pleased to meet you,
Mr. President,
I’ve only met three Americans.
Joe Kennedy,
J.P. Morgan,
and Fred Astaire.’
‘Thank God,’ I said,
‘you met Mr. Astaire,
or what would you think
of the rest of us?’
Good evening.
Good evening.
Mrs. R-r-r Roosevelt
Mrs. R-r-r-r-r-ro-ro...
I’d love to,
your majesty.
We could have sold tickets
to this dinner,
and made ourselves a pile
of money.
<i>The moon was coming up</i>
<i>there was a warm...
summer breeze</i>
<i>It was... just... her</i>
<i>A perfect summer night!</i>
To His Majesty, the King.
<i>Inside... Everyone
was very  impressed behavior!</i>
To His Majesty, the King.
And to Her Majesty, the Queen!
Actually, normally,
we wouldn’t toast the Queen.
<i>The tray...</i>
<i>was of Mrs.Astor</i>
<i>24 plates collapsed</i>
<i> for no reason.
just before the soup.</i>
What happened?
I don't know.
No one touched it.
I su-su-suppose an angel
just passed -
a ve-ve-ry clumsy one.
<i>but some people</i>
<i>had other explanation...</i>
It’s the full moon.
Daisy?
Oh hello, Dick.
You think it’s full tonight?
What?
Oh -- yes.
That moon certainly is full.
She says I’m right!
Oh, I don't know for sure--.
I could be wrong.
I just.... Such an important night.
Is it?
I don’t know.
What’s one king more or less?
He still has to put his pants
on one leg at a time.
Did you curtsey for the Queen,
Daisy?
I certainly did!!
And I think I did it right.
I didn’t fall down!
How come you’re not
inside there, Daisy?
I’m glad to see you working.
It’s just for the one night...
Well it’s something...
Can I take some home
for my dog?
He doesn’t have a dog.
Touch me there again,
you’ll be wearing it
and not eating it...
Nu-nu-number 2!
Shoot!
Those damn horses.
It’s not the horses’ fault--.
I know. I know.
You like them.
I’ve been looking for you.
Do you need a handkerchief?
Come here.
We saw you out here--.
We??
Franklin’s asked me to tell you
that you could go home.
He thinks he’s going to be occupied
with the King all evening now.
Of course he will...
<i> No one lost to go to bed that night.</i>
<i> Finally Franklin had to instruct the band
to stop playing.</i>
<i> He wished to spend time
with the king, on his own.</i>
Let's go to my study.
Will be quiet out there.
Unless you need to--.
No. No.
Would you mind pushing?
Her Majesty has gone to bed?
She has.
And -- your wife?
Who knows?
I'm sure.
Would you my closing the door.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Do you collect stamps?
I did.
I have.
I understand you are
a serious stamp collector.
Perhaps, you would show me
some of your stamps.
You can’t be interested.
But I am --.
Do not -- protest.
When I was a young man --
before my marriage of course --
I found that showing one’s stamps
was a very helpful way
to get a young woman’s attention.
Was it.
But I suppose if your father’s
the king...
Who needs stamps?
The Queen
is certainly a lovely woman.
As is the first lady.
She’s a --
strong -- person
Some days
you don't feel like
getting out of bed --
but then these women,
they won’t let you do that,
will they?
No.
What do you do --
to be alone?
You need to give them
a reason not to bother you.
You can figure things out
in the quiet of your own mind.
I open up my stamp books
and everyone knows
not to bother me.
You were wonderful tonight,
young man.
What do you mean?
Just what I said.
You were graceful.
You were confident.
You're going to be
a very fine king.
I don't know what to say.
Your father would be
very proud.
I’m not so certain
about that.
If I were your father,
I’d be proud.
The Queen --
she’s... She worries so much.
It’s been hard for her.
Women worry.
I just stop listening
to her sometimes.
Forget I said that.
Forgotten.
I’ve been asked
to say things...
Such a war as we now
co-cocontemplate --.
The carnage,
Think at S-S-S-Spain.
Ch-children -- b-bbombed.
Tha-tha-that’s what we can expect.
It will b-b-be horrific.
And yet
we know some
of your countrymen
wi-wi-wi-sh my country ii- i-i-ill...
And w-w-want us to fail.
And want me to fail
wi-th-thth you...
This god damn st-st-stutter...
What stutter?
This god damn polio.
Sometimes I think --
they deserve
better than me.
My -- ‘subjects.’
I’m sorry.
I don’t know why-why
I’m saying this to you.
I’m s-s-supposed to be trying
to convince you to help us.
Let me confess
something to you, now.
As you have been so honest--
with me.
No one -- ever mentions the fact
that I can’t use my legs.
It’s never referred to.
Not by anyone.
I used to think it was because
they were embarrassed about it.
But now I think it’s because
is not what they want to see.
Of course you and I
We think
they see everything
that we are.
All our flaws.
Or transgressions.
Or failures.
But that is not
what they’re looking to find
when they look to us.
And God help us
if that ever changes.
Do you imagine
the disappointment...
when they find out
what we really are.
Thank you.
They didn’t want me
as their King.
I didn’t know they voted
for that in England.
I’m thinking --
another drink?
Right!
<i>Suddenly only one can sleep
that night</i>
<i>Was it the moon?</i>
<i>How a longed fan</i>
I beg your pardon...
Sir.
I mean, Your Highness.
Your Majesty...
Good night.
You're still awake?
Mmmmmmm.
I think I'll go to sleep.
It's late.
Why are you smiling?
Are you drunk?
No.
He's a very funny man.
Has some wonderful jokes.
Like what?
I couldn't tell you.
They're not meant
for women.
They sound very 'funny.'
He liked my stories too.
What stories?
I-I-I told him about
the coronation.
About how they p-p-put
the crown  wrong way around.
And the stepping on my robe
so I couldn't move.
You shouldn't
have told him that.
We don't make fun
of ourselves.
That's not true.
Not here.
Of course he liked those stories,
they make us look like fools.
They make us look like people!
Don't be naive, Bertie.
He made fun of himself too.
He said at the picnic tomorrow--
Oh god that picnic.
He said that the Indians --
they were Eleanor's ideas.
"One of my-my-my wife's
crazy ideas."
His Mother is furious about it.
Franklin's just trying
to keep it short.
He talks about his wife
like that to you?
I hope you didn't talk
about me to him.
I didn't.
I wouldn't do that.
We didn't talk about you.
I asked him --
without mentioning you --
about these hot dogs?
What's that about?
You want to know what he said?
He said he doesn't get
the fuss.
They're just a good thing to eat
at a picnic.
There's no 'meaning.'
Nothing more.
You didn't say
I was concerned?
No.
I'm not sure I believe you--.
That's not fair.
Three different women tonight
asked me if I thought
there could ever be
an American queen.
If we'd ever 'allow' that.
That was rude.
Give me a cigarette?
I have smoked all of mine.
That won't help you sleep.
I know.
Thank you.
Give me lighter?
Light, of course!
I never wanted this life.
I know.
It’s hard.
I'll be fine.
If there's a war --
and we know there will be --
he believes America
could be persuaded to help.
Did you see some of the people
here tonight?
Hear their names?
They're from Italy.
Germany.
They're Irish.
-  Their ancestors--
- they're Jews.
They hate us, Bertie!!
They want to see us fall on our face!!
They want to laugh at us!!
I think you're wrong.
I th-th- think we just need
to be a little more confident.
I'm not sure I can even sleep.
Finally,
he patted me on the knee
and said,
'young ma-ma-man,
it's time for you to go to bed."
Like a father, I suppose.
He's very happy that I am king.
Good Night.
## If I didn't care
more than words can say
## If I didn't care
would I feel this way?
## If this isn't love
then why do I thrill?
## And what makes my head
go 'round and 'round
## While my heart stands still?
## If I didn't care
would it be the same?
## Would my ev'ry prayer begin and end
with just your name?
## And would I be sure t
hat this is love beyond compare?
## Would all this be true
if I didn't care for you?
<i>If ever I missed him,</i>

What the hell
are you doing up here?
Tommy?
What the hell are you doing here?
You shouldn’t be up here now.
Why?
Why not?
Can you get that
out of my face, please?
President can't be disturbed
right now, Daisy.
Daisy!
How nice to see you up here.
Do you want to see
the President?
Come back.
Come back!
Daisy!!
Daisy!!
Daisy!!
Here.
No. Get out of here.
Listen to me, Daisy.
He wants to talk to you.
He’s going home.
He’s headed home.
I want you to listen to me.
very very carefully.
Understand?
Understand?
Look at me.
Look at me, Daisy.
Understand?
I know you are --
intimate.
I've known
since the day it happened.
What??
Those things he said?
He meant them.
I know that.
That hurt.
Cigarette?
I need one.
But I accepted.
Like you will.
I am a part of his life,
and I accept
that you are too.
I don't accept you.
What about Dorothy Schiff?
Do you accept her?
Why do you think she has built
that place next to Top Cottage?
- There are other cottages on that hill--
- He asked her to.
He asked her to build a cottage,
so they could live close together
when he retired,
while he wrote
those goddamn detective books
he's always talking
about writing.
I read the letter.
When was that?
This year.
It wasn’t Eleanor
who ‘abandoned’ him.
She caught him too.
With you?
No.
This was -- long ago.
Years and years ago.
Maybe you’ve met her.
Mrs. Rutherford.
I... I misunderstood.
I wonder...
I wanna us...
realistic.
I don't think I can ...
'share'-
Oh I think you can.
You can.
You decide.
You won't go to bed.
He’s waiting for you.
Missy and my Mother
both severely criticized me
for not having invited you
to the dinner tonight.
I want to apologize.
I think I showed you these
when you first came to visit me,
Daisy.
But you probably don't remember.
I remember.
Aren't they beautiful?
Can you see from over there?
The highest waterfall in the world.
That's on this stamp.
I really don't think you can see
from way over there, Daisy.
I really don't.
And that -- would be terrible.
Not to.
How do you see me?
What?
Am I --
to you -- just stupid?
No, Daisy.
But I can understand
how you can feel that way.
Am I --
Like...
a whore?
No, you are not 'like a whore.'
Now would you come over
and sit by me.
No, you’re not getting off
that easy,
you son of a bitch!!
<i>But that’s not what I said.</i>
<i>Instead:</i>
No. I need to go.
I’d say I’m sorry --
but that wouldn’t do
any good right now,
would it?
Someone’s coming out.
Which one is she?
The one you think
looks like a governess.
I tought she was
the governess.
I understand that's a very
common thing --
men and their
children's governesses.
She's not the governess.
But she's obviously
his mistress.
She dresses like a--.
She's not the governess,
Bertie.
Men find --
some men find--
I think because
they're around children,
there's something
quite attractive about--
Why do you keep talking
about governesses?
Is there something
you want to tell me?
No. Nothing.
Why?
Look over there.
The secretary?
I hadn’t seen her before.
And she's his mistress too.
According to Cameron.
- We don't need Cameron to--.
- Cameron says there's another one.
Another--?
Who's married.
But she's built a cottage by his?
Or something.
Another mistress?
Good thing we changed our minds
about bringing Lilibet with us.
You changed your mind.
I never wanted
to bring Lilibet to America.
Only be-be-because
you don't like Americans.
I like Americans.
That’s not fair.
I don’t like
a lot of Americans.
I like some.
Bertie,
are you going to eat a hot dog?
What???
At the picnic.
Tomorrow. Today.
I mean,
isn't it like having
say the PM over
and serving him
bangers and mash?
He probably would like--.
To a guest!
If we did that
he'd know we were trying
to tell him something.
He'd understand.
What would he understand?
How we felt about him.
The PM knows
how we feel about him.
We like him.
As if that matters.
You know what I mean.
I wish I did.
Bertie, I don't think your brother
would eat a hot dog.
How would you know that?
Because he'd know
what was meant!!
It doesn't mean anything!!!
The walls, sir.
They are quite thin.
- We know.
- One can hear--.
Everyone in this house
is already awake.
But to answer your question,
Elizabeth,
I am going to eat a hot dog,
no five hot dogs,
ten!
I'm going to shove them
into my mouth,
stick two up my nostrils,
two more in my ears,
then walk around
so people can take pictures
of the King of England
with hot dogs hanging out
of his orifices!!
Don't ever compare me
to my brother again.
Sir.
It's the President.
Has she gone?
What do you think
she’s going to do?
I don’t think
she’ll cause you any trouble.
If that’s what you’re asking.
Is that what you’re asking?
They’ll see us.
Hello! And good morning!
- Wave.
- I am.
Hello!
Hello!
Lovely morning, isn't it?
Sleep well?!
Oh yes. Yes, we did.
Didn't we?
We did!
Good!
Me too!!
I thought
I might have a swim...
Come along?
gosh... a swim.
Daisy is that you?
Let me help.
You’re up early.
I just woke up.
<i>And so,
the day of the picnic began.</i>
<i>And everyone pretended,
as usual...</i>
<i>not to notice anything.</i>
They feeding you
all right out here? Boys.
Throwing you the odd bone?
We’re eatin’ like kings.
Mr. President.
You have king to thank for that.
I made them all agree --
no pictures in our bathing suits.
Though you don’t look so bad.
Maybe you should get
your picture taken like that...
And get the women’s vote.
But that’s right --
you don’t vote for king.
you two counfy
like that?
Yes, thank you.
Here we are.
I'm not driving with him again.
Wave...
Wave, wave...
She’s here.
Good for her.
What are you doing?
I’m ...
so pleased you came.
I promised my Aunt.
How do you do?
How do you do.
Mrs. Langdorf
So nice to meet you.
Tommy, looks who’s here.
Daisy,
would you come with me?
Tommy,
she has every right to be here.
He wants her sitting with him.
I’m not doing that.
Who wants
you sitting with him?
The President, ma’am.
Daisy...
Daisy, please.
Where are your manners?
Let’s sit up
with the President.
Just Daisy,
thank you ma’am.
Please.
Daisy,
What were you doing
way over there,
The special guests
are here on the porch.
You should be here.
Please sit down, Daisy.
Please, Daisy.
How much more of this
is there?
Thank you, Indian Baritone!
Thank you so much.
He wasn't finished.
Oh. I thought he was.
Thank you, thank you.
Let's all say thank you,
to Ish-Ti-Opi in Cherokee
which is tokapi
Tokapi
Come all say it again,
boys and girls come on...
Let's enjoy it,
say Tokapi
<b> Tokapi.</b>
Thank you,
thank you so much.
<i>at last...</i>
<i>after Eleanor's Indians...</i>
<i>the event we're all secretly
waiting for...</i>
Your Majesty...
Would you like -- a hot dog?
Do you take mustard?
I take ...
whatever you think
I should take with my hot dog.
Allow us then to put
a bit of mustard on for you.
Daisy, would you show
how we put the mustard.
You are too kind.
Why are they applauding?
It's all right!
It's fine!
What's this about?
<i>And like that --</i>
<i>we felt America and England
were back on the road</i>
<i>to being very good friends.</i>
<i>At least,</i>
<i>I’m told that’s how some people took it.</i>
<i>It made me wonder --</i>
<i>maybe the hot dogs
hadn’t been Eleanor’s idea</i>
<i>after all.</i>
<i>When he left for England
later that day,</i>
<i>the King sent back a telegram,</i>
<i>in which he wrote that our
two nations had now ‘forged’ --</i>
<i>and these are his words:</i>
<i><b>a special relationship.</b></i>
It's good! It's all fine!
I'll have another!!
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>he sent a car.</i>
<i>But I said I was too ill
to take a drive.</i>
<i>I was ill the next day.</i>
<i>And the next.</i>
<i>And the next day after that.</i>
<i>A week after the Royals’ visit
to Hyde Park,</i>
<i> the President came in person
to my house.</i>
Good morning.
<i>I had been waiting.</i>
<i>He drove us by the plumbing shop</i>
<i>where his mother
had returned the toilet seat</i>
<i>she had ordered for the Royal Visit,</i>
<i>without paying for it.</i>
<i>He tried to make me laugh.</i>
<i>And he was good at that.</i>
<i>He was after all a politician.</i>
Mother wants to pay him now.
But he says it’s really been good
for business.
<i>He hoped I would forgive him.</i>
<i>But I was damned
if I was going to tell him </i>
<i>that I already had.</i>
<i>Occasionally now,</i>
<i>Missy would come
and fetch me when she felt --.</i>
I think he could use --
your company tonight.
Let him wait.

<i>When we play cards...</i>
<i> Missy and I are partners...</i>
<i> we now share everything!</i>
<i>I learned,</i>
<i>as we got to know
each other better,</i>
<i>of Missy's bouts
with her 'blackness.'</i>
<i>And of her 'dark days.'</i>
<i>When she fell terribly ill.</i>
<i>He paid for everything.</i>
<i>He even changed his will --</i>
<i>giving her half --</i>
<i>should she outlive him.</i>
<i>But to the surprise
of nearly everyone --</i>
<i>he did not visit her once
in the hospital.</i>
<i>I asked him why.</i>
<i>It's a terrible fault of mine,</i>
<i>he said.</i>
<i>I find it too painful
to be around illness.</i>
<i>I grew close not only to Missy
but to all of Franklin’s boys.</i>
<i>They seemed to accept me,</i>
<i>no questions asked.</i>
<i>And no more promised
were made </i>
<i>so none could be broken.</i>
<i> A year pass...</i>
<i> And then, another...</i>
<i> and another...</i>
<i> I watch him grow tired,
and fail and ill</i>
<i> He tried the high best
of everyone...</i>
<i> He knew how to do that.</i>
<i> for everyone, but me...</i>
Mr. President.
Ok boys, Take it away!
<i>Everyone still looking to him.</i>
<i>Still seeing it ever was.</i>
