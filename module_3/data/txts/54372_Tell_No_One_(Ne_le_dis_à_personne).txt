TELL NO ONE
You guys free next weekend?
I told you we'd wake her.
Let me hold her.
You want to cuddle with Alex?
If she cries, give her the pacifier.
- Against her will, even?
- Yes.
The country... What a drag...
I think he's ready.
After nine years of med school,
a kid's the last thing he needs.
Why not?
Are they annoying you?
Poor thing. You feed her
exhaust fumes all day long.
No worries, I know what she likes.
Wrap the blanket around her.
LAKE CHARMAINE
François! François!
Daddy! Daddy!
Let's go.
Stop that!
Looks good.
- Did you call your sister back?
- No.
Why are you being like this with her?
Like what?
I don't know.
You totally ignored her last night.
- Because she won't sell the farm?
- It's crazy.
It costs us a fortune.
She doesn't even want to live there.
You think your dad
would've wanted to sell?
That's irrelevant.
She's a rider, not a manager.
Who'll run the stables?
Me? I don't have time.
- Don't get mad.
- I'm not.
You always take her side.
You're right. I'll butt out.
Margot, it's not that. Look, I'm sorry.
I'll let the dog out.
I'm sorry.
Margot?
Margot?
Alex!
Eight years later
Okay...
I think I've seen enough
to contradict your family doctor.
We'll take her off cortisone.
It won't cure her eczema.
What will help her
is if you let your child enjoy her life.
<i>Get off me!</i>
You know what I would suggest
when she doesn't have school?
Cartoons in bed,
fries for lunch,
friends to visit all afternoon,
Barbie, chocolate,
the whole shebang!
<i>Call him, I said!</i>
And lots of TV, of course. Excuse me.
<i>Let go of me!</i>
<i>Let go of me or I'll pop you!</i>
- Call him!
- Calm down...
Get lost! Who the hell are you?
Get lost, I said!
- Calm down.
- He hit me!
Bruno, what's wrong?
He fell off the couch!
I told them to call you!
I called the ER first!
- He's your patient?
- For three years. Hemophiliac.
Bruno, give them your son.
- No. Why not to you?
- It's not my unit.
- Fuck that! I want you.
- Bruno...
Nobody touches my boy!
Nobody touches my boy!
Okay, Bruno.
Your son probably
has internal bleeding.
Give him to me.
I'll take him in if you want.
Stand back!
What you staring at?
Two bodies unearthed
in Rambouillet forest
Shit, that's good.
Julie, show Mr. Rossignon to table nine.
- I love lunch with you.
- Oh, sorry.
Summer's usually quiet,
but we're overrun by tourists. Olga.
I'll have the sole.
And turn the air up, it's sweltering.
You got plans tomorrow?
I promised Margot's mom I'd stop by.
Alex, don't you think it's...?
It's been eight years.
I'm not saying turn the page,
but I don't see why you always
celebrate this morbid anniversary.
- Celebrate?
- Whatever.
You've nothing to say to them.
You see them once a year,
to commemorate her death.
I'm sorry...
It's just I thought
we'd spend the evening together.
I'll come by afterward.
If you shut me out,
you'll shut everyone out.
Talk to me, okay?
How you doing?
Going nuts, sitting doing nothing.
I can imagine.
Unfortunately, it's the only option.
They'll call you
when the operation's over.
Now that you're here, I'll take a walk.
Call me if there's news.
Sure.
Thanks.
What? Take it back.
You'd prefer a DVD player?
Plasma TV? A sweet plasma?
I don't want anything. Take it back.
I'll call you.
<i>Click on the link. Anniversary. 6: 15 pm.</i>
<i>Doctor, Mrs. Offenstein...</i>
<i>Click on the link. Anniversary. 6: 15 pm.</i>
<i>Server not found</i>
Is there a problem with the intercom?
Not at all. Show her in.
Rambouillet police called.
Sergeant Lavelle.
He said it was urgent.
What are you staring at?
I love watching you ride.
- Come more often then.
- Yeah, I should.
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.
Can you tell me when you last
went to Lake Charmaine?
I was down there last year.
And you, doctor?
Eight years ago.
Like I told your brother on the phone,
workmen laying pipes
dug up two bodies near the lake.
She heard it on the radio.
Yes, the press caught us
with our guard down.
- You've identified them?
- No, we're running tests.
All we have is two Caucasian males
shot dead over 5 years ago.
You said the bodies weren't
on our land. So why speak to us?
I'm getting to that.
We may have to excavate farther,
so I'd need permission to...
You have it.
- Anne?
- Of course.
- You need a signature?
- Yes.
Both your signatures.
Sorry to drag this back up.
I know your wife's killer was tried...
Cut the crap.
You thought I killed her.
You were her husband.
Family members are often...
If not for that,
you might have found her alive.
My colleagues had to examine
every possibility.
Thank you.
I'll need one last thing.
- What?
- A blood sample for a DNA test.
When your wife was abducted,
you said they hit you...
Yes.
Well, we found a baseball bat
with the bodies
with traces of blood on it.
B Positive. Just like you.
You are type B Positive?
Of course, they could be victims
of Frank Serton,
except serial killers
rarely change their M.O.
Neither body shows signs of torture.
They'd been buried.
There were no animal corpses.
And Serton's victims were all women.
So?
So, it's all a bit fuzzy, doctor.
Let's talk again when it's not.
That's precisely
why I need your cooperation.
I'll give the sample,
but I told you all I knew back then.
Yes, I read your statement.
Your wife screams,
you get hit, fall in the water.
Wake up in the hospital.
And the rest is still a blank.
We bought that version.
But if it is your blood,
the discovery of these two bodies
means we'll reopen the investigation.
I'll get it.
We'll try to get some answers
to all those questions,
like why were you found
unconscious on the dock?
Who made the anonymous 911 call?
And above all,
how did you get out of the water
when unconscious?
Ms. Vigne is a nurse.
She'll take your blood sample.
I thought you'd prefer
to do it right here.
Céline, I'm not taking calls.
<i>Yes, doctor.</i>
<i>Tomorrow, same time + 2 hrs.
Message for you.</i>
<i>User name: Concert
Password: Olympia</i>
<i>TELL NO ONE. THEY'RE WA TCHING.</i>
Are you seeing anyone?
I'm sorry, Alex.
You don't have to tell me,
it's none of my business.
There's no one.
I mean, nothing serious.
Alexandre...
We all miss her so much.
But you have a life to live.
Don't feel guilty
about seeing other people.
I don't. I mean, it's not that.
I'll check the lamb.
How are you?
Good. And you?
Retirement.
I wake up every morning
and make like...
Drink?
Jacques?
I have an important question for you.
I want to know...
Margot...
What did she look like
when you found her?
What?
I keep thinking about it.
Maybe it's the anniversary.
I need to know.
I never asked you for details.
Was she beaten?
Why are you doing this?
I really need to know.
There were bruises, yes.
Where?
Alexandre...
- On her face?
- Yes.
- Her body too?
- I didn't see her body.
I was there as her dad,
not a cop, to ID her.
Did you identify her easily?
Easily?
You said her face was bruised.
Screw you and your questions!
If you could please identify the body?
<i>Her left eye was swollen.</i>
<i>Her nose was flattened and broken.</i>
<i>Her face was slashed,
probably with a box cutter.</i>
Her jaw was dislocated,
tendons ripped out...
I'd like you to leave.
Already?
- They kick you out?
- Yeah.
EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS
To conclude this tribute,
I'd like you to welcome
the President
of the Children's Trust,
organizer of tonight's show
in memory of his son,
who will lead the riders out.
Please give a warm welcome
to state senator Gilbert Neuville!
Four short strides. It's tight.
So at 8:15 tomorrow,
you get another message, right?
Right.
Where's that?
Don't know. Not in France, it's still light.
How can you think it's her?
You can't see shit.
Don't go there, Alex.
It'll drive you insane.
I know.
How did it go?
I placed second.
- Bed for me. I'm wiped out.
- I was just leaving.
You want some food, sweets?
It's nothing. We had a fight.
She thinks I'm banging
one of the waitresses.
Lose that and get back to the emails.
You knew the two guys at the lake?
Show me the other one.
Same sender?
Anonymous. Who knows?
I do. It's the same person.
You tried the passwords?
Yeah. The account doesn't exist.
The sender will set it up at 8:15.
I'm hooked up to both his computers.
As soon as he's online, we'll know.
I think I know enough already.
Dr. Beck?
Detective Meynard, Versailles police.
Can you follow me?
What's going on?
Excuse me a second.
- Where'd you go?
- Wash my hands.
Captain Eric Levkowich, Versailles PD.
What's all this about?
It'll be easier to talk at the office.
Mr. Beck...
Who is Juliette Langlois?
Will you stop that?
Does the name Juliette Langlois
mean anything to you?
Juliette is my wife's middle name.
And your middle name?
Arnaud.
So let's imagine
that I ask you if the name
Arnaud Ripper
means something to you.
You'd say, "Actually,
Arnaud's my middle name."
My wife grew up on Rue Langlois.
That's why I said
it was her middle name.
It reminded me of her.
Did your wife ever use that name?
In what way?
"Hello, I'm Juliette Langlois,
I booked a room..."
Or to get an ID with that name, see?
No, it was a game we played
when we were kids.
Did you ever beat your wife?
Let me repeat the question.
Did you ever beat your wife?
What's wrong with you?
Slapping your wife's no crime.
Pretty natural even, huh?
No, it's not natural.
I never beat my wife.
Are you listening to me?
Doctor?
You think I did that?
I promised your friend Hélène
I'd help you,
but I need you to tell me
all you can, understand?
The car accident story, is it true?
Of course it's true.
Were you with her?
I was doing my internship in Bordeaux.
- I'm warning you. They'll check.
- Let them.
I know what I'm saying.
Maybe she took the photos
for the insurance. Seems logical.
No idea. I never saw them before.
Are you forgetting anything?
No. What happens now?
Eight years on, it's a bit late
for a wife-beating charge. This stinks.
Okay, go for it.
Love it!
Now let's get a little wild.
This is really good.
Hold the duck in front of you,
like it's your thingy.
Your tongue out,
like you're gonna lick it.
That's great.
Fred!
And again. More tongue!
Love it!
Hold on.
I don't get it.
You came to ask me that?
That's all you have to say?
I'm sorry.
I don't give a shit about sorry.
That's not the problem.
I was grieving too, you know.
I needed you there.
You never called.
You never took my calls.
I couldn't.
I swear. I couldn't face calling you.
I thought I'd pull through alone.
But I just went under.
Tell me what happened.
I don't know.
Weren't you with her?
No.
One evening, she came by
covered in bruises.
She said she'd had a car accident.
If anybody asked, I was to say
we'd been together in my car.
If anybody asked?
I think she meant you.
She wouldn't tell me anything else.
Nothing, honestly.
- You took photos?
- Of?
Her. Her injuries.
Why would I do that?
No reason.
What's wrong?
I've no idea.
She was my best friend.
Look at me, please.
I swear she never lied to you.
It was the only time.
You gotta believe me.
<i>Ferrault & Gamblin.</i>
May I to speak to Mr. Ferrault, please?
<i>He's in court. Can I take a message?</i>
We found no trace of an accident
in either the insurance
or police records.
Alex never hit Margot.
He couldn't have.
Can you leave us alone?
Captain,
if your son-in-law decided
to kill your daughter...
He loved her. Why'd he wanna do that?
For 200,000 euros.
Her life insurance policy.
That's absurd.
With all the holes in the official story,
compare it to this:
Beck drives her to an isolated locale
where there'll be no witnesses.
There, the two guys we found
last week kidnap and kill her.
Serton's on the loose.
It's in all the papers.
They make it look
like she's one of Serton's victims.
With dead cats and dogs all around.
Easy as that. He takes the rap.
Serton confessed to seven murders,
but not to your daughter's.
This is ridiculous.
Alex was assaulted.
He was in a coma for three days.
He had to get hurt.
How'd he explain a couple scratches?
He was on the shore.
How'd he get out of the water?
All the doctors who saw
his file say it's impossible.
Didn't that ever intrigue you?
Who gave you those?
In some way,
I'd say it was your daughter.
We found a key
on one of the two corpses.
To your daughter's safe deposit box.
Box 174.
Registered to one Juliette Langlois.
Her middle name and this street name.
The photos were inside.
Your son-in-law said
he never saw them.
Why would she hide them from him?
You talked to Alex?
Yes.
- What else did he say?
- Nothing. He left with a lawyer.
Not just any lawyer. Elysabeth Feldman.
Does that sound like an innocent man?
Stop it, now, that's enough.
It's impossible. It's the cops
trying to manipulate you.
They can do anything with computers.
She looked older.
Age progression software.
They use it for missing kids.
Mommy!
If they think I killed her,
why send me emails
as if she's still alive?
Think about it.
To get me to confess.
If I killed her, I know it's a trap.
- Alex, not now.
- It doesn't make sense.
If they wanna trap me, send me emails
from a guy who saw me kill her.
You see?
If daddy says yes,
we'll go this weekend.
Come on, sweetheart,
it's time to sleep now,
and don't give her a hard time.
Sleep well, princess.
Where's Margot?
I asked you a question.
Where's Margot?
Nina.
Go away. To your basket.
Cut it out.
Fuck it!
Hold on, let me try.
I've been trying for half an hour!
It doesn't work.
Nothing works.
Fucking thing.
What's that up there?
What is it?
It means you're connected
to another computer.
And?
And I only have one computer here.
Someone's connected to my computer.
They're watching me.
Fuck it.
Okay.
That was The Basque.
The chick's bailed
and Beck's out walking his dog.
He'll keep in touch.
She told us all she knows. Let's go.
Hit the lights.
You asshole.
Come on, Nina.
You can't bring a dog in.
You were first.
Number 15.
<i>Hello U2. You have 1 new message.</i>
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.
Near the bandstand.</i>
<i>Be careful. I love you.</i>
<i>Parc Monceau, tomorrow, 5 p.m.
Be careful. I love you.</i>
Eight years ago, my wife,
Margot Beck, was brought here.
She was one of Serton's victims.
Frank Serton, yes?
Did you do the autopsy?
Yes.
Do you photograph the corpses?
Yes, we do.
So you photographed
my wife's autopsy?
- Most likely.
- I'd like to see them.
I don't have them here.
The case is closed.
But I can see the report?
Sure, but not today.
You have to request to see it.
There are forms, a procedure.
Okay, I'm making the request.
- I'm Captain Barthas, Crime Squad.
- Hello.
My partner's here with the witnesses?
In the kitchen.
He was the last person you saw?
Yes.
- What time was it?
- I don't know. Around 2 p.m.
- She introduce you?
- Yeah.
She tell you his name?
Alexandre Beck.
- We found this.
- Where?
A trash can downstairs.
He's going down. It was
a pleasure working with you.
A doctor has latex gloves
in his trash can? Big deal.
We'll send it to the lab, though.
Karim, take care of it.
Fuck! Check this out!
Springfield.45.
Patrick. It's all yours.
Look.
It still smells.
But that's not the green one.
Let's look for the green one together.
Is that the green one?
It is?
That's not green.
- It's orange.
- That's orange?
No, that's blue.
- That's orange.
- Very good, that's orange.
Can you find the green one now?
If I don't answer, then I'm busy.
Put her through.
Yes, counsel?
Last night? Why?
Because she was shot dead
last night at her studio.
Listen to me.
The murder weapon was
in your apartment. You'll be arrested.
The murder weapon?
That's bullshit. What were they doing
in my apartment?
Later. They're going to take you in.
I'll try to beat them there.
- Well?
- Coming.
If I get there after them, stay evasive.
Keep your answers vague,
is that clear?
Are you there?
That's the green one.
<i>Just sit tight.
They'll be there any minute.</i>
Not now. No can do.
<i>I'll be right there!</i>
Barthas to Levkowich.
Barthas to Levkowich.
The beltway!
Around the other side!
You four, that way!
Vincent, go with them!
Hello? Bruno?
Not at all. In fact, he got in early today.
Did he seem at all nervous?
Nobody mention anything?
No. Only Mrs. Abidal
after he jumped out the window.
- He take any private calls?
- Yes. Ms. Feldman.
- You talked to him?
- Yes.
- What did you say?
- I told him to sit tight.
- Who tipped you off?
- I don't tell the DA my sources.
You realize your client
just signed his confession.
Well?
I hate being wrong.
- What about?
- About him.
I don't care that he lied
but he should trust me, not run.
He didn't do anything. He was scared.
An innocent man doesn't run.
I pay you a fortune to hear shit like that?
Come on!
Follow me.
Sit on that or the car'll stink.
Who fired those shots?
Some pals.
Beltway's out. You fucked it up good.
Yeah?
What? Who?
Hold on, where are you at?
Get out of there!
Be right there.
One little errand,
then we'll get you some clothes.
The owner?
Send me it in writing, then.
Who was that?
Ballistics.
About?
The shotgun.
And?
Stop fucking around, they're off!
The gun?
It was his dad's. François Beck.
Let me do that.
It's simple. When his dad died,
he inherited the gun.
But he smacks his wife around,
so she hides it with the photos.
Who pays for the box for eight years?
Why's the key on a dead man?
It's full of holes.
We all know it and we all shut up.
Who cares about the wife?
He'll get 20 years for the photographer.
What are you saying?
You know what I'm saying.
If we prove Serton didn't kill her,
he'll get a retrial.
That'd piss a lot of people off.
What do I care if it pisses people off?
All I want is the truth.
I called his lawyer to tip her off.
Are you stupid?
For his wife's murder,
a zillion leads and no proof. Why?
- Because he's good.
- Exactly.
So tell me why he's dumb enough,
eight years later,
to keep the murder weapon
in his home.
He could plan his wife's murder,
but now he's under pressure.
Sure.
So much so he took time out
to request access to his wife's autopsy
before heading to his office
to wait for us.
May I speak to Dr. Herbin
at the medico-legal institute?
Yes, I'll hold.
Bye, Mom. See you on Sunday.
The groceries are done.
Thanks, son. See you Sunday.
- Goodbye, Simone.
- Goodbye, Antoinette. Goodbye, Simone.
<i>Ferrault
Attorney at Law</i>
- Hello?
- Yes?
Sorry I'm late.
I have an appointment with Mr. Ferrault.
Are you sure?
Gentlemen.
Sorry to press you,
but this is very important.
Was my wife your client?
No, she wasn't my client.
But you met her?
Yes.
A few years ago, I was assigned
to defend Helio Gonzales.
- Know who I mean?
- No.
A street kid raised
by the Children's Trust
your wife worked for
with Philippe Neuville.
- The showjumper and senator's son.
- And?
When Neuville's son
was found in a dumpster
with two bullets in him,
Gonzales was the prime suspect.
He was well known to the police,
and he was seen with Neuville
the night he died.
- And my wife?
- She was his alibi.
Meaning?
At first, she said that,
at the time of the murder,
he was in her office
for career counseling.
Of course, nobody bought it.
Why?
Career counseling at 11 p. M?
Given the penalties for perjury,
I suggested she come clean.
What did she say?
What did she say?
Obvious, isn't it?
She was with Gonzales.
They'd been lovers for two months.
It ain't such a big deal.
You never cheated on her?
No.
The guy in the shirt.
What we doing with this guy?
Who asked you?
He staying long?
I owe this guy from three years ago.
I took my kid to the hospital,
all bruised up.
Fuckers thought I'd beat up on him.
This guy tells the cops it wasn't me,
my kid's a hemophiliac.
As long as he needs us,
we're there, okay?
Take it easy, he just wants information.
Fuck!
- Cool it!
- Stay right there!
It's cool, guys.
Back off!
- It's cool.
- Take it easy.
What you wanna know?
Sure, I fucked your wife!
I fucked her for months!
What's up?
Shut the fuck up!
No kidding, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man.
She loved when I spat in her mouth.
Your wife was a slut. Don't blame me.
Let go of me.
You never fucked my wife.
She was in Lyon.
I can prove it and wreck your alibi.
I don't care if you killed Neuville.
But I'm accused of murder
and I wanna know why.
So tell me what you know
or go get your ass fucked in jail.
You think jail scares me?
I don't give a shit.
I didn't kill Neuville.
I was doing business,
with no alibi, and she saved my ass.
You see her again?
She's dead, man.
Why'd she do it?
How do I know?
She gave me a story. I said it.
Now, get out of my face, faggot.
You're crazy, man.
Why we here if it was a lie?
I wasn't sure. I was bluffing.
You were bluffing?
You're a total headcase.
Good one. "I was bluffing."
Motherfucker.
I thought if the cops got her husband,
she'd show up to help him.
I have no idea how he got away.
I didn't know she'd set up a meeting.
No, I don't know where he is.
Okay, I'll call you back.
Excuse me,
do you have the time, please?
- Just after 5.
- Thanks.
I don't know if it's her, but the kid's real.
She look like the photo?
I don't know. The eyes, maybe.
She's leaving. What do I do? Grab her?
She's headed for the gate.
Zach, she's yours!
I'll stay with him.
It's not her. Back off!
You hear me?
Get back in position.
<i>He's leaving. What do I do?</i>
I repeat. He's leaving. What do I do?
He's coming this way.
<i>Bernard?</i>
Grab him.
Keep calm!
What do you want?
Where's your wife?
I don't know.
Where is she?
I don't know!
Where's your wife?
Where's Margot?
Move it, asshole!
Freeze!
Stand up!
Untie him!
Untie him, shithead!
You okay?
Who you working for?
Don't move!
Holy fucking shit!
Floor it!
<i>- Yes?
- Eric?</i>
<i>Beck is booked on a flight
for Buenos Aires at 10:30 p.m.</i>
Wait for me.
Philippe had just turned 5.
We were waiting for the school bus.
I was holding his hand.
The bus arrived.
The doors opened
and he suddenly let go of my hand
and jumped on the bus.
I had this incredible urge
to pull him back
and take him home.
That's when I understood
what I had felt
the day he was born.
A blend of joy and apprehension
and also
terror.
I sensed that despite my efforts
something could happen to him
at any time.
I'm scared of disease.
I'm scared of aging
and I'm scared of death.
But it's nothing compared
to what I felt that day,
the knot in my stomach
as I watched the bus drive away.
While my son rots underground,
she may still be alive?
I can't accept that, Bernard.
Do you understand that?
Do you?
I understand, sir.
<i>Passengers for the flight

<i>are invited to proceed...</i>
<i>Charlotte Bertaud was shot

<i>A suspect, Dr. Alexandre Beck,

There.
She booked her ticket

She had the seat next to his.

She checked in?
Yes, she must be boarding.

Enjoy your trip.
Out of the way! Police!

Let me see your passport or some ID.
No fair. My controller's not working.
- Always got an excuse.
- Smart-ass.
Check it out!
I don't believe it.
- He did you good.
- It's the controller.
I always get the dud.
He always blames some shit.
Hey, no shoes.
Give us a break
with your scuzzy carpet.
Well?
I don't get it. Nothing.
Mouss, come on.
I'm sorry.
Really.
Forget it.
I'll send a guy for my son
when he's better.
Okay, guys.
See you.
Hold on.
Hello?
<i>This is Alexandre Beck.</i>
<i>- Yes?
- I can prove I didn't kill Charlotte.</i>
You can?
Hold on while I step outside.
Go ahead.
Good evening.
Captain Levkowich.
We met at the hospital.
- Yes?
- Can I have a word?
Sorry, my wife's expecting me home.
I don't believe Beck killed anyone.
Right now, I'm the only one.
- You're the smarty-pants, right?
- That's right.
But I'll need your help.
You must know where he's hiding.
Correction. You're the dummy.
If you don't help me,
we'll find him anyway.
When we do, it could get nasty.
He was booked
on a flight to Buenos Aires.
Of course, he didn't show,
but he was traveling with one
Caroline Parreire. Know her?
Hold that.
Well?
What?
Caroline Parreire?
Never heard of her.
- Did Margot Beck do drugs?
- No way. You're nuts.
The autopsy report suggests otherwise.
- It's confidential.
- You're shitting me?
Show me a photo. Just one photo.
Funny, I had the same reaction.
There aren't any. They vanished.
A problem?
- Did he call?
- No.
Hélène?
What?
What's wrong?
The photos...
I took them.
It was Philippe Neuville
who beat her up.
Why?
I don't know. She wouldn't tell me.
And you did nothing?
- What could I do?
- Take her to the cops.
She refused to go.
She said she just needed evidence.
She wouldn't even let me tell you.
And you never said anything?
What did you expect me to do?
Tell my brother
while he's mourning his dead wife
that just before she died,
she got the crap beaten out of her?
Would that have helped him?
She asked me to keep it secret.
No kidding.
What?
You rode Neuville's horses.
If you'd accused his son of battery,
you'd have been fired.
It was a smart choice asking you.
She knew you'd keep your mouth shut.
Hello?
Yes, Elysabeth?
I'll email you one right away.
Thanks a lot.
A Briard. Cute, huh?
You're helping a fugitive...
Shut up or the dog
will piss on your career.
You established Charlotte's
time of death as 10:45 p.m., right?
Give or take 30 minutes.
This dog proves Beck is innocent.
He was on a computer at Medianet
between 10:36 and 11:13,
according to their records.
He was told to leave the dog outside.
Two witnesses have positively
identified him.
Assuming the alibi checks out...
Don't worry, it will.
Assuming it does,
there's just one hitch.
The murder weapon
we found at his place.
Trouble is, the tables have turned.
That's now your problem.
Tell the press your men planted
evidence without your knowledge.
At worst, you're a coward.
At best, a DA with no authority.
Are you crazy?
Who'd believe they'd do that?
Nobody.
So tell the press Dr. Beck
is wanted as a witness,
the last man to see the victim alive,
and is suspected of nothing.
Agreed?
- He'll answer questions?
- Don't pretend you can negotiate.
I promised to keep it a secret.
I never meant to hurt you.
Say you forgive me.
Thanks for telling me.
Did you know?
- About Neuville?
- Of course not.
I saw her. I swear to you I saw her.
I believe you.
Come here.
Don't worry, just a courtesy visit.
We'd like to apologize.
<i>Traces of heroin...
regular user...</i>
<i>Weight: 49 kg
Height: 1.75 m</i>
- It's not her!
- Really, why?
She was never 1.75 m tall!
Where are the photos?
There are none.
- They think they were stolen.
- By who?
The only person to request the file.
Mr. Laurentin, Margot's father.
Did your father own a gun?
A hunting rifle you inherited?
Do you know where it is?
In my cellar, I guess.
You're not sure?
I moved eight years ago.
It must be in a box someplace.
I don't think so.
It was in Juliette Langlois'
safe deposit box. With the photos.
I don't have to talk to you.
Call my attorney.
Pierre Ferrault?
Elysabeth Feldman.
That's a relief. Ferrault called us.
I thought you'd maybe
changed lawyers.
We were surprised you'd go
for a washout like him.
Ferrault's the pits, you know that?
Why did you go to see him?
- To retrace my wife's last days.
- Why?
I agree with you
that Serton didn't kill her.
- Ferrault confirmed that?
- No, it was a dead end.
But he told you about Philippe Neuville?
What's he got to do with Margot?
That's what I decided to find out.
- Meaning?
- I ran some tests on that rifle.
Know what we found?
It was the gun
that killed Philippe Neuville.
Of course, I'm not accusing you yet.
I won't risk looking
like a total idiot twice.
I don't mind. I'll take the risk.
For Alexandre Beck
care of Hélène Perkins.
Sign for it, please.
<i>For Alex</i>
I'm in the kitchen.
What the hell are you doing?
- Where's Martine?
- In a safe place.
- A safe place?
- Move!
What's this about Neuville?
Who was cremated eight years ago?
Sit down.
I read the autopsy. It wasn't Margot.
Sit down, I said!
- Have you seen her?
- I think so.
Where is she?
I don't know.
- She's in trouble.
- You think you can help?
You couldn't eight years ago.
Sit down!
I was out cold.
I know. I was there.
What?
For the last time,
get your ass on that couch!
Have you any idea how much
I miss your daughter?
Sit down, Alexandre.
Two months before Margot
disappeared,
a kid from the Trust came to see her.
He seemed very on edge.
Margot tried to find out why.
After a half-hour,
the kid bursts into tears and says
that Neuville's son
has been raping him for months.
Margot asked Neuville to stop by.
You were in Bordeaux.
- Let go!
- That's not all!
- We need to talk.
- No way.
Tell me the truth, Philippe. Please.
I never hurt them.
Stop it!
<i>She'd asked me to arrest him
if she got him to confess.</i>
I couldn't stand there and watch.
<i>I killed him with your father's gun.</i>
<i>Then I dumped the body.</i>
What's that crackling?
The signal's fine.
- He found it.
- Sit down.
He's found the wire! Let's go!
Nobody moves! Is that clear?
Nobody moves until I say so.
<i>There was this street kid, Gonzales.</i>
He'd done jail time.
<i>The ideal fall guy.</i>
<i>It would have been all so simple.</i>
<i>But</i>
she couldn't stand that idea.
Next day, she asked your sister
to take the photos.
She thought she could use them
if Neuville's dad ever suspected us.
And he soon did,
after Margot got Gonzales
off the hook.
And then
she called Neuville
to tell him she had evidence
against his son.
Knowing old Neuville,
I knew exactly what he would do.
So I tapped his phone.
He hired the goons at the lake?
Bartola and Pagnac.
He paid them
<i>to get the evidence and get rid of her.</i>
<i>What saved Margot's life</i>
<i>is that one was
an even bigger scumbag.</i>
<i>I offered to pay Bartola double</i>
<i>if he agreed to change the plan.</i>
- You pulled me out of the water?
- Yes.
<i>Bartola respected his side of the deal.</i>
<i>Not me.</i>
The only way to calm Neuville
was if Margot disappeared.
I knew they planned to make out that
<i>she was one of Serton's victims.</i>
<i>I had to find a corpse.</i>
<i>I was thinking of digging one up</i>
<i>when I took a call at work.</i>
<i>A junkie had been knifed by the station.</i>
<i>I went alone.</i>
<i>I dumped the body
maybe 100 km away.</i>
I made sure I got there quickly
for the identification.
You were in the hospital.
Why would a father lie anyway?
Everybody bought it.
She knew about the abduction?
She would have told you.
You'd have gone to the cops
and we'd all be dead.
<i>Old man Neuville has every cop
and DA on his payroll.</i>
<i>I should know. I was top of the list.</i>
- Where'd she go?
- I bought her a ticket for Madrid.
I don't know if she stayed.
Never any news?
No.
So, why now?
The press coverage
of those two bodies they dug up.
Your name got mentioned.
I guess she realized I'd lied.
When Margot came around,
she asked where you were.
<i>I couldn't tell her the truth.</i>
<i>It was the only answer</i>
or else she'd never have gone.
She truly would be dead today.
What did you tell her?
That you were dead.
There's more.
I did it for her, Alex.
For all of us.
<i>My only mistake was the key.</i>
<i>Bartola had taken it out
of Margot's purse.</i>
<i>I forgot to check their pockets.</i>
Neuville wouldn't let it drop.
He kept a close eye on you and me.
The burglary at your house
just after her death...
I mean, disappearance. That was them.
Looking for the key.
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't she file charges?
It was too late.
I'd already crossed the line.
Your dad had come to see me
six months earlier.
My father?
<i>One evening</i>
<i>he stayed late at the stables
with a sick horse.</i>
Léa, what's wrong?
Philippe? What's wrong with little Léa?
- I can explain.
- You don't have to.
I understand perfectly!
Do you know how old she is?
- Get out!
- No, I won't. You're...
Get out! Go!
Get the fuck out!
You're on my property!
If I was younger, I'd kick your ass.
But I'll make you pay.
You're scum.
I'll make sure action's taken.
She was one of the kids
he and Margot worked with.
Lots of them helped out at the stables,
do you remember?
<i>Next day, he came to file a complaint.</i>
I won't calm down! That won't help.
<i>I tried to persuade him
to talk to Neuville,</i>
<i>but he just brushed me off.</i>
<i>Neuville loved your dad.</i>
<i>He'd been a trainer
at the stables for years.</i>
<i>He taught his son to ride.</i>
<i>I thought it would stop there.</i>
Thank you.
<i>But Neuville knew François
would talk eventually.</i>
It's all in there.
Names and addresses
of Neuville's men.
Details of every rotten affair
I got mixed up in with him.
<i>Including the Angeneau
assassination in 1995.</i>
Your father didn't die
in a hunting accident.
They killed him.
Stop! Don't shoot!
<i>What a fine partnership!</i>
<i>In the ring now is Rimsky,</i>
<i>ridden by Hervé de Luze.</i>
Mr. Neuville?
Captain Barthas of the Crime Squad.
Will you follow me, please?
Gilbert?
What's wrong? What's going on?
Tell me.
Please follow me.
What the hell are you doing?
I killed him with your father's gun.
Then I dumped the body.
I know you have a wire.
I know they're listening.
Now I'll tell you the truth.
Margot! Wait!
TELL NO ONE
