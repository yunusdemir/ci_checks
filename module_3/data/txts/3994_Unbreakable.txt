This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.
Thank you.
Is there a name yet?
Elijah.
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?
May I?
Can I have him back?
What happened during the delivery?
Nothing.
It was very quick.
The babyjust wanted
to come right out.
And there were no problems.
Did you drop him?
What?
Did you drop this baby?
Jesus Christ, no.
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.
All right.
Molly.
I've never seen this.
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...
while inside your uterus.
His arms and his legs are broken.
This is Eastrail 177.
Nextstop, Philadelphia.
Are you alone?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Someone left this magazine.
Want to take a look at it?
Could I take a look at that one?
Thanks.
- You like sports?
- It's my field.
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?
I'm afraid ofwater.
Think that's a problem?
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.
He's a cornerback.
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.
He runs a 40 in 4,3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.
Do you like football?
Not really.
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
Nice - Nice to meet you.
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?
- I'm married.
- Great.
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?
I--
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...
- s-saying--
- I know.
I think I'm gonna find another seat.
I-I didn't mean, uh--
That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.
I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?
But I'm afraid you forgot this!
- And this! And--
- Where has you been, Banana?
Now I've got you, weasel.
Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.
We are notsure at this time, uh...
how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.
If you're just tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...
has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.
And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.
Yes, that is-- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...
and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.
I don't know how close they're
gonna be able toget, David.
These are woodsand, uh, trees.
It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.
Try to hack some of that off.
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.
You were in a serious accident.
Look at me.
How are you feeling?
- Okay.
- Good.
I'm gonna ask you some questions.
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?
- No.
- Any allergies?
No.
Where were you sitting
on the train?
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?
Yeah.
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?
No.
Did you get up from your seat?
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?
Yes.
Why are you looking at me like that?
Your train derailed.
Some kind of malfunction.
They only found
two people alive so far--
you and this man.
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...
why I'm looking at you like this.
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.
And two...
because you didn't break one bone.
You don't have a scratch on you.
David?
What happened in New York?
I don't think I got the job.
I'm still going to, uh--
I'm still moving there.
Just--
Uh, just - just not now.
Good night.
Good night.

- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?
No, sir, he is not.
I read about you in the paper.
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.
A horse almost trampled me to death.
- Wow.
- Had him put down.
That's a sad story.
Could-- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?
Proceed.
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...
since I've worked here?
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.
Thankyou.
Hey, Noel.
What, you hit your head on that train?
Get your brain
to start working again?
- What?
- Forty dollars.
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.
That's it.
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.
Smart way to make your point.
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.
- He's asleep.
- Oh.
I wanted to ask you a question.
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...
just think about it
for a second, okay?
Okay.
When's the last time I was sick?
Do you remember?
Um, I-I don't know.
It's been a while.
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.
Okay.
Do you remember me gettin' sick?
Um...
not a specific day.
And what's-what's this about?
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?
In the three years
we lived in this house?
In the old apartment?
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?
I-I can't remember.
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?
What do you think it means?
Um...
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.
You might fall between
this chair and that television.
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.
You make this decision now...
to be afraid...
and you will never turn back.
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.
- I got a present for you.
- Why?
Forget why.
You want it or not?
Well, go get it, then.
Where is it?
On a bench...
across the street.
Someone's gonna take it.
Then you better get out there soon.
I bought a whole bunch.
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...
every time you want
to come out here.
They say this one
has a surprise ending.
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.
This again is common,
but only in villains.
The thing to notice about this piece...
the thing that makes it
very, very special...
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.
When the characters
reached the magazine...
they were exaggerated...
as always happens.
This is vintage.
Well...
wrap it up.
You've made a considerably
wise decision.
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.
Once again, please?
My son Jeb--
it's a gift for him.
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.
No.
No, no, no, no, no.
You need to go. Now.
What'd - What'd I say?
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...
with my name printed on it?
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.
This is an art gallery,
my friend...
and this is a piece ofart.
We're by appointment only.
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?
Seventy-five percent.
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?
That's hole number one.
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.
About all what?
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?
Dad's been injured.
Is the child correct?
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.
That's hole number two.
That's a big one.
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...
with nothing else to do but read.
I believe comics
are our last link...
to an ancient way
of passing on history.
The Egyptians drew on walls.
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.
I believe comics
are a form of history...
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.
This city has seen its share
of disasters.
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fiire.
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specifiic combination of words...
but they never came.
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...
and I heard them.
"There is a sole survivor...
and he is miraculously unharmed."
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.
It's a genetic disorder.
I don't make a particular
protein very well...
and it makes my bones
very low in density.
Very easy to break.
I've had 54 breaks in my life...
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.
There are type two,
type three, type four.
Type fours don't last very long.
So that's how it popped into my head.
If there is someone
like me in the world...
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...
couldn't there be someone else...
the opposite of me
at the other end?
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?
And he probably
doesn't even know it.
The kind of person
these stories are about.
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.
To guard us.
- You think my dad's a real--
- I don't think anything right now.
It's a possibility--
one with many holes.
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad--
Do it now, please.
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...
you tell them a fantastic story...
and somewhere in there you say it:
"I just need
your credit card number...
a small down payment."
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...
sadness.
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.
I'm gonna leave now.
Good luck with your exhibition.
So, what kind ofjob
do you have, David?
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.
I'm a security guard.
Hi.
I've come to a decision.
Okay.
I just wanna ask you something, okay?
And you can be totally honest.
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.
Have you been with anyone?
I mean, since we've
been having problems.
The answer won't affect me.
I just need to know, you know?
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.
No.
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.
Anyway...
my decision is...
that I want to start again.
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.
I feel like it's a second chance.
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...
that'd be okay.
Okay.
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.
Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.
What's he look like?
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...
you chose protection?
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.
You made that decision,
and I find that...
very, very interesting.
Now all I need is
your credit card number.
That last part was a joke.
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.
Programme here.
Programme.
Programme.
Programme. Programme here.
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.
-Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.
Yeah, step right up here.
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...
was carrying a weapon?
I don't know.
Maybe it was that camouflage
armyjacket he was wearing.
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.
You thought he was carrying a knife?
- I thought he was carrying
something, yeah.
- But not a knife.
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...
tucked in his pants.
You know, like on TV.
You have good instincts
for things like that?
- Like what?
- Knowing when people
have done something wrong?
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.
- You can get to your seat right down--
- Characters in comics...
are often attributed special powers--
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.
Okay.
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.
- But he might not have been
carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.
- One last question.
- What?
That car accident you were in.
Was there anyone else involved?
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.
She was in the car with me.
Have a good life, Elijah.
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.
...into the investigation
of train 177...
being conductedat the Eastrail
holding warehouses.
The citycouncil has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...
requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...
of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...
and its outlying districts.
Hold up a second!
I just want to ask you something.
Dad! Hey, Dad!
Dad!
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be if
she knew you were playing football?
Are you gonna tell?
You wanna play last ofthe downs?
We got a big guy like you.
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.
He's going pro in the draft.
They say he can run the
40 Yards in 4,3 seconds.
Yeah, I've heard.
You can beat him, Dad.
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.
Just play one set ofdowns.
I told them you were great.
- Why'd you do that?
-Just one.
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need--
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!
I've got to run
To keep from hiding
And I'm bound
To keep on riding
And I've got one more silverdollar
How much did you put on there?
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.
How much can you lift?
That's the most I ever lifted.
That could've been dangerous,Joseph.
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?
No.
I mean, if you knew karate.
No.
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?
No, Joseph.
How much did you take off?
I lied.
You added?
How much is it?
270 pounds.
Let's put more.
Okay.
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?
More?
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?
What do you do
if something bad happens?
Get Mom.
Right.
How much did you put on that time?
All of it.
What else can we use?
How much is it?
How much is it, Dad?
About 350 pounds.
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...
in the form of a spiral fracture.
There were 14 breaks.
It simply shattered.
They call me Mr. Glass.
- Who does?
- Kids.
Are you all right, Mr Price?
Shall I continue?
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.
Hospital stay will range
from fiive to eight days...
followed by 9 to 12 months
of physical therapy.
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.
The hospital discharged him
this morning.
Thanks.
Elijah, right?
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy ofyour good leg with this...
and it works your quadriceps.
How long have you been married?
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?
I'm a little nervous being here.
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.
A car accident.
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.
My husband was a star athlete
in college...
and we were in
an accident together.
Our car flipped on an icy road
and we were both injured, and he
couldn't play football any more.
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.
- How so?
- I think we should talk
about your rehab.
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.
It prevents atrophy by--
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.
It's pretty much that simple.
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but--
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...
and took football out of the equation.
And everyone lived happily ever after.
Sort of.
What part of David's body was injured?
Who said my husband's name was David?
Ladies and gentlemen--
In the first half--
A 737 crashes on takeoff--
172 die, no survivors.
A hotel fire downtown--
211 die, no survivors.
An Eastrail train derails
7 1/2 miles outside the city--
131 die...
one survivor.
He is unharmed.
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...
however unbelievable...
is now more a probability.
And what was it you suggested?
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.
I hope you can keep an open mind.
Excuse me, sir?
Can you step out of line, please?
We've been having some problems
with people selling drugs
here in the stadium.
Would you mind if I check your pockets?
Raise your arms, please.
Come on, raise them up.
I just got here, man.
Can I put my hands down now?
Can I go?
Yeah.
Hope you find them.
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.
He wants you to come down there.
Is that your dad?
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.
I mean, you're not on our list.
Audrey handles this type of stuff.
Oh. What type of stuff?
Joseph stuff.
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?
No, no, it's more emotional damage.
Not, uh-- Not to serious, physically.
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.
When was that?
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.
You don't remember me, do you?
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...
around the pool because of you?
The kids still tell about it...
Like it was some sort of ghost story.
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead."
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.
You still phobic of water?
It was Potter and another guy.
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.
Y-You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.
I tried to make them stop...
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...
I thought I might be like you.
I'm not like you.
You are like me.
We can both get hurt.
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.
Why do you keep saying that?
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.
Jesus.
He didn't do anything. Hejust...
told me his theory.
That's sad when patients get like that.
They lose reality.
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?
Oh, my God.
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.
In your Rookie of  the Year trophy.
Joseph, did you load the gun?
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.
No one believes him.
Joseph, listen to me.
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.
I'll show you.
Do you remember the story about the--
about the boy that almost
drowned in the pool?
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.
- You're lying.- I'm not lying, okay?
I just didn't remember it, that's all.
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.
You know that.
You know all about that.
Don't do it.
He'll die,Joseph.
- I'll just shoot him once.
-Joseph, listen to what your moth--
Don't be scared.
Joseph...
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.
Y-Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...
and I'm going to leave for New York.
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real.
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't--
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?
N-No shooting friends,Joseph.
Joseph!
You are about to be in big trouble!
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!
One, two--
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...
to end your football career,
no questions asked.
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.
I guess that makes sense.
Football's what, just ten years?
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?
I think I know what that is.
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.
I never said you couldn't be killed.
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.
I have been sick.
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.
Heroes don't get killed like that.
Normal people do, right?
I don't need to see you any more, okay?
Please stay away from my family.
She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry
What about you
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.
I gotta head.
And she sighed, ahh
lsaid, I want to be a singer
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.
Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics
Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby
Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears
I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a--
Losin'my life to
a whore with disease
-Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please
The baby-sitter's here.
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.
We can do this another time.
Don't lie.
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired
- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!
She's a little bit older than me
Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk
Breasts like a cluster  of grapes
I can't escape her ways
She raise me
- Dude.
- Even if you have no one
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...
I'm calling 5-0.
And while you're at it, baby
Man.
You don't want to sleep
aftersetting my loins on fire
That's it, cracker jack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired, I've been tired
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?
I've been tired
- Rust?
- Yeah.
As a colour, not as rust.
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.
Mine's still brown.
Okay, my turn.
Favourite song?
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.
What?
We're supposed to be honest.
"Soft And Wet."
That's very interesting.
Okay, my turn.
When was the first time...
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?
That's not the game.
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.
What about the game?
It's over. I won.
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.
- Maybe it was a time--
- I had a nightmare one night...
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.
I think that was the first time.
Does that count?
That counts.
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?
Yes.
Why?
I don't know.
I just don't feel right, Audrey.
Something's...
just not right.
Do you resent us, David?
Resent the life you have?
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.
These were your choices.
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...
I never would've wished
that injury on you.
What you could do physically...
was a gift.
I never would've wished it to go away.
You know that, right?
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do her own perm, and now
she looks like she stuck her head--
Who called through?
Um, someone from New York...
uh, about a security job.
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.
Thanks for telling me.
We weren't all gonna move.
Oh.
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.
Great.
Look, let'sjust be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...
and I don't expect
you or I to change...
the course of where
our lives were headed...
because of one date.
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.
We'll just be forced to take it slow.
And in the end, I think
that's defiinitely better.
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...
to get carried away.
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.
David, it's Elijah.
It was so obvious.
It was this one issue
that brought it back for me--
Century Comics 117.
That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...
because they all have one,
just like you.
Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.
You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.
But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.
We swallow it too fast, we choke.
We get some in our lungs, we drown.
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.
We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.
The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.
You have a weakness-- water.
It's like your kryptonite.
You hearing me, David?
Audrey?
Gotcha. Come on.
Audrey. Audrey.
Hey!
You'll be okay.
What-- What happened?
I thought I was--
I thought I was dead.
Me too.
Is she all right?
I think her leg's broken.
Are you hurt?
Hey, man, are you hurt?
Hello.
I wasn't injured in that caraccident.
David.
I've never been injured, Eliijah.
What am I supposed to do?
Go to where people are.
You won't have to look very long.
It's all right to be afraid, David...
because this part won't be
like a comic book.
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.
There's one in the first row.
It's-- It's the second one.
Yes. It's the second one over.
Go back to Africa!
Hey, what's your name?
I think you drank too much.
Can I come in?
Who are you?
I like your house.
Can I come in?
What is this?
No, you can't come in.
Are you sure?
What are-- What are you--
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.
I had a bad dream.
It's over now.
I don't know.
I can't believe you'd think that.
I'm just asking you.
I'm making French toast.
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?
Okay?
Okay.
You were right.
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.
See the villain's eyes?
They're larger than
the other characters'.
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world--
just off normal.
He doesn't look scary.
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.
But he says there's always two kinds.
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...
and then there's the real threat--
the brilliant and evil archenemy...
who fights the hero with his mind.
Are you Elijah's mother?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.
He's spoken ofyou.
Says you're becoming friends.
We are.
Looks like he's doing good today.
I'm very proud of him.
He's come through a lot in his life--
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.
Mm-hmm. They were bad...
but he made it.
Yes, he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
Yes, he is.
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.
It has begun.
Tell me something, David.
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?
The sadness?
No.
I think this is where we shake hands.
- Look!
- Did you see it?
I worked in that building 25 years.
I know all its secrets.
Secrets?
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.
Passengers aren't allowed in there.
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?
To not know your place
in this world...
to not know why you're here.
That's--
That's just an awful feeling.
What have you done?
I almost gave up hope.
There were so many times
I questioned myself.
You killed all those people.
But I found you.
So many sacrifiices...
just to find you.
Jesus Christ!
Now that we know who you are...
I know who I am.
I'm not a mistake.
It all makes sense.
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?
He's the exact opposite of the hero.
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?
Because of the kids.
They called me Mr. Glass.
