Looks like a doll's house.
It is a bit like a doll's house.
This is loose,
so you can get underneath this.
- This is 5'9".
- Why?
So the back-line guys can get in
and out of there.
Look at those balconies.
It might be nice to get them
out there, from... One wide.
You know what I mean, Bob?
Hand-held.
Well, that we can do.
I don't know.
I have no idea why
the stage is designed in this way.
If there's any really rhyme
or reason to it.
- Which part?
- All of it.
- You wanted it.
- I never asked for those.
That's Marty that wanted all of those.
I thought he wanted those.
So we got them now.
I hope he likes them.
I don't know what's going on.
I did a hundred things over there,
but nothing that I needed to do.
<i>I still got no answers.</i>
<i>They're all over the place.</i>
That's the set.
What are these?
The camera's arm.
They could come
the next week together.
No, the set's gotta be built now.
They're building it.
<i>If worse comes to worst, we change it.</i>
<i>We break it up and we cut it.
We saw it in half.</i>
<i>We can glue it to different pieces...</i>
Until they're all in the same place,
we're not gonna
ever get a final decision.
Do it again.
<i>My other worry about the cameras was,</i>
<i>Marty, that they whiz around
all the time.</i>
<i>That's very annoying to the audience</i>
<i>and to everyone on the stage.</i>
<i>And it's dangerous.</i>
It would be good
to have a camera that moves,
that swoops down, and in and out.
And tracks us, you know,
along the side somehow.
<i>Is that it?</i>
I think so.
<i>Okey-doke, you guys. Nice to chat.</i>
These are the songs that I've prepared,
that he said he really wanted to do.
These are the songs
that are really strong possibilities
and these are the ones
that they're going to rehearse.
But we got six days to go,
and he still hasn't given me an idea
of what the set list was gonna be.
<i>Loving Cup we already did.</i>
<i>Shine A Light, Some Girls,
As Tears Go By.</i>
<i>Too Much Blood, he wants to do.
She Was Hot.</i>
This is my setlist
for Austin and the Beacon.
It's been a bit of work, you know.
<i>First Time I Met the Blues, possibly.</i>
Getting a good mixture,
and then things that everyone likes,
and things that are not so well-known,
and things that kind of work
for a theater and things that don't.
Try and avoid those.
<i>Factory GirI, he wants to do.
I'm Free, he wants to do.</i>
Categorizations and obsessions.
All be done, Marty.
On the night, you know,
an hour before the show.
That cleared my sinuses.
After you guys rehearse,
I'll do something with Bob.
You start creeping in.
We'll just warm up and get the feel
of the room and the setup.
<i>So if you want to have
a specific conversation with Marty</i>
<i>about a shot when he says "move"
in a particular song,</i>
because he is extremely precise.
Pat should have a wide
of the whole place, if he can.
Even with the cranes in it.
<i>Pat Capone, you should be wide
of the whole place.</i>
Can we know, if at all possible,
what they're gonna play?
And if... It doesn't have to be in order.
If we know,
and it would be nice to know...
If Mick stands in front of the light
for more than 18 seconds, he'll burn.
- What do you mean "burn"?
- He'll burn up. He'll get too hot.
You mean, like flames?
- He might catch on fire.
- We can't do that.
We cannot burn Mick Jagger.
Very simple.
We want the effect,
but we can't burn him.
- What is that for?
- We're gonna do some lighting tests.
That's normal movie stuff, is it?
What do you think?
I love movies... Looking at them.
That's the best one.
I've got to show you one other thing.
If you can get a camera in here.
Where is Charlie Watts?
Or somebody else has got to kick.
This is my only view.
Nobody else sees this shit except me.
It'll be good here
when we get people in here,
when we get the live crowd.
And the set list. I can't wait to see
what we finally end up with.
What's the matter, Joe?
We got a lot to do.
Communication,
that's what I'm onto now, Bob.
Communication systems.
<i>Give me champagne when I'm thirsty</i>
<i>Give me a reefer
when I want to get high</i>
Then we go into...
Whatever the set list is gonna be,
the first two
are going to be really strong.
Okay, then the problem with...
I really would like to know
what the first song's gonna be.
Because if the first song opens
on a guitar riff, a guitar intro,
we have to make sure
that we're covered which guitar.
It usually is Keith.
We have to know that.
Or if the keyboard begins
and then Mick starts singing,
the cameras have to be on Mick.
I'm just asking, find out what it is.
<i>- Clinton will be here.
- What is it? A benefit concert?</i>
<i>For his foundation?</i>
Thank you.
It's great to see you.
My nephew's coming. He's 10 or 11.
And I've got some friends coming
with all their kids.
And they're really excited.
I had all these people in their '60s,
calling and begging me for tickets.
So how's the audience gonna be
with all these cameras?
Your guys are gonna be
in this first balcony.
This is President Kwasniewski.
He just left being President of Poland.
This is rock and roll, okay?
Don't be nervous about anything.
So, their guests aren't scheduled
to be here until around 6:00 or 6:05.
Whose guests?
The meet and greet guests.
Mr. Clinton's.
- We just did it.
- You met and greeted the President.
But he's got 30 guests coming.
So we're not gonna do that until 6:05.
Hey, Clinton, I'm bushed.
<i>They said,
"I'm waiting for Hillary's mother. "</i>
<i>You're so nice to wait for her.</i>
Hi, Mom.
The Rolling Stones
have been waiting for you.
Hello. I'm Ronnie.
Very pleased to meet you.
Hello. Nice to see you.
Hi, Dorothy.
- And there's Charlie.
- Charlie keeps it all going.
- And some inserts of hands and faces.
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>This is one of my birthday presents.</i>
<i>I get to open for The Rolling Stones.</i>
<i>I want to say a speciaI word of thanks</i>
<i>on behalf of Hillary and Chelsea
and myself</i>
<i>to The Rolling Stones for doing this.</i>
<i>I actually did open
for The Rolling Stones once before.</i>
<i>They did a concert
in Los Angeles in 2001</i>
<i>to raise awareness
of the threat of climate change.</i>
<i>They know as much about these issues
as we do.</i>
<i>They care about them
as much as we do.</i>
<i>And that's why
they're giving us this wonderfuI night.</i>
<i>Thank you and God bless you all.</i>
Let's get ready to go.
Everyone, get ready to go.
<i>And now, for their second
and finaI appearance</i>
<i>at the Beacon Theatre,
please welcome The Rolling Stones!</i>
- Set list.
- Okay, first song.
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>How you doing? Okay?</i>
<i>You've been doing this
for how many years?</i>
Two years.
And how much longer
do you give yourself doing this,
- going round being a sort of...
- I don't know.
I never thought I'd be doing it
for two years even.
When we started off, I never thought
we'd make it very big anyway.
And now we've been making records
for two years
and everybody still calls us
quite a new group.
I don't know, quite honestly.
I think we're pretty well set up
for at least another year.
Well, if you weren't a music maker,
what would you like to be?
- Design.
- Design what?
A designer, 'cause I was one.
I'd call myself a designer
because I couldn't be a painter.
Because I'm not versed well enough
in the language of painting.
I'm not talented enough.
You need talent, surely, and discipline.
No, you need a lot of talent, as well.
What sort of talent?
The talent of knowing.
But knowing comes from discipline.
Not necessarily.
So the talent is to have an imagination?
Yeah.
So do you think you're imaginative
with your work?
Yeah.
Maybe it's just
an inferiority complex I got.
Maybe I'm great after all.
- Who do you think you are?
- Mick Jagger.
<i>You've been on your second tour
of the United States for two weeks.</i>
- How was it?
- It was very enjoyable. Most enjoyable.
Very successful, too.
Well, that was not true of the first one,
was it?
Oh, no. But we only came over here
on the first one
so we could get ourselves known,
so to speak.
And when we went back,
things started happening for us.
Well, why did they start happening?
I don't really know.
Some sort of chemical reaction
seemed to happen, somehow.
What would you say happened?
I really don't know quite honestly.
<i>Jack White.</i>
<i>We're gonna do a really old song
for you now.</i>
<i>It's one of the first we ever written.
In fact, we never did it.</i>
<i>We gave it to someone else
'cause we were slightly,</i>
<i>slightly embarrassed about it
the first time we wrote it.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Lovely, isn't it?</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones leader,
sentenced to jaiI a month ago, is free.</i>
<i>He has won his appeaI
against the prison sentence.</i>
<i>And tonight he flew by helicopter
to a location 30 miles from London</i>
<i>to appear in World In Action.</i>
<i>Publicity on the case is split
between the society</i>
<i>which resents the anarchy of people
like The Stones</i>
<i>and that which favors
greater individuaI freedom.</i>
<i>Tonight, World In Action examines
the reasons for this split.</i>
<i>With Mick Jagger are</i>
<i>William Rees-Mogg,
editor of The Times newspaper,</i>
<i>Father Thomas Corbishley,
a leading British Jesuit,</i>
<i>Lord Stow Hill, who has been
Home Secretary and Attorney GeneraI,</i>
<i>and Dr. John Robinson,
Bishop of Woolwich</i>
<i>and author of the controversiaI
reassessment of Christianity,</i>
Honest to God.
<i>Mick Jagger has been silent
for three months.</i>
<i>He's read of people
saying he's got what's coming to him</i>
<i>and he read The Times asking
"Who breaks a butterfly on a wheeI?"</i>
I try to keep out of discussions
on religion
such as some pop stars try and get into.
Try to set a good example to teenagers
by being religious.
We're trying to keep out of that.
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I just ask you
to take your pictures
as speedily as possible.
I don't think we're being unreasonable.
I don't propagate drug views
such as some pop stars do.
This whole sort of thing
was pushed upon me.
By whom?
By the mere fact
that I've been prosecuted
and also with Keith being prosecuted.
We didn't make a public statement
on religion, on drugs,
or anything like that.
Gentlemen, can I interrupt?
If it continues on that sphere,
then I'll have to cut...
<i>Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards
was arrested last night here in Toronto.</i>
<i>Keith Richards,
how will this conviction affect you</i>
<i>and your music
and The Rolling Stones?</i>
I just want to get on with it,
now that it's over.
Do you think
it will have any effect, then?
Might get a song out of it.
<i>Yesterday, after you arrived,</i>
<i>somebody wrote
that on this visit to Australia,</i>
you're about as controversial
as the local vicar.
Does that particular description
offend you or please you?
- Who said that?
- A journalist in Sydney. In a paper.
That's all right. I don't want
to be offensive or controversial.
- Mick Jagger.
- Hi.
This is noticeably different
from Germany.
We're actually in Denmark, not Sweden.
Though you're Swedish,
which is confusing for us.
We'd all like to know what kind of joy
or what kind of thing does it bring you
on a personal or professional level?
It was very enjoyable.
- Could I ask you how old you are?
-29.
Twenty-nine yesterday.
- You are the same age as me.
- Oh, isn't that wonderful?
How long do you want to do it?
Do what? Be on the road?
Be The Rolling Stones.
"And what would you do, Mr. Jagger?
"Please tell us what you will do
if you are not Mick Jagger?"
I say, "Well, I'll be somebody else. "
What do you feel just before
you jump onstage
- in front of 100,000 people?
- I wake up.
Well, I usually say to myself,
"You better... do a good show. "
That's what I do. That's my last thought.
"This better be good. "
What is the question, Keith,
that you've been asked the more often?
That question you just asked me.
"How long do you think
you're gonna carry on singing?"
<i>My God, what's up next?</i>
<i>What are you doing
with that strange instrument, Ronnie?</i>
<i>Can you drive that really?</i>
<i>We're gonna do
a little bit of country for you now.</i>
<i>This one we do is called
Far Away Eyes.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Thanks, crackerheads.</i>
<i>Here's a song that was written...</i>
<i>I don't know if it was written
by Muddy Waters,</i>
<i>but I first heard it done
by Muddy Waters.</i>
Champagne and Reefer.
<i>And Buddy Guy is gonna help us out.</i>
<i>Thank you. Buddy Guy!</i>
<i>Buddy... Guy.</i>
It's yours.
<i>Thank you!</i>
<i>You're being wonderfuI.</i>
<i>You've been a... great audience,
I tell you.</i>
<i>Lord have mercy.</i>
<i>You're sounding good,
you're looking good,</i>
<i>you're doing everything you should.</i>
<i>I'm going to tell you
who's up here tonight,</i>
<i>who's playing and singing
and carrying on.</i>
<i>First I want to introduce you...</i>
<i>From Queens, a very beautifuI lady,
Miss Lisa Fischer!</i>
<i>I fucked up.</i>
<i>She's not from Queens,
she's from Brooklyn! I'm sorry.</i>
<i>You're from Queens, right?
You're from Queens.</i>
<i>I got this one.</i>
<i>Right behind her, from Queens,
Mr. Bernard Fowler!</i>
<i>From South Africa, Mr. Blondie Chaplin.</i>
<i>Tim Ries. MichaeI Davis. Kent Smith.</i>
<i>On the tenor saxophone, Bobby Keys.</i>
<i>On the keyboards, Chuck Leavell.</i>
<i>On the bass, DarryI Jones.</i>
<i>On the guitar, rocking Ronnie Wood!</i>
<i>They love you, Ronnie.
They really love you.</i>
<i>On the drums,</i>
<i>Mr. Wang dang doodle, Charlie Watts.</i>
<i>- Want to say hello?
- Hello.</i>
<i>He speaks.</i>
<i>On the guitar,
and now the vocals, Keith Richards!</i>
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>How did that come across? All right?</i>
<i>It's good to see you all, you know.</i>
<i>It's good to see anybody.</i>
<i>So if you're all all right...</i>
<i>Hey, baby in blue.</i>
<i>We're gonna go on and
You Got The Silver.</i>
<i>Thank you, Ronnie.</i>
<i>CooI, huh?</i>
- Well, how are you physically?
- Me? I'm fantastic, baby.
- Are you up for this tour?
- Sure.
The other word on the street
is that this is the proverbial last tour.
Yeah, so they said
in '75, '72, '69, et cetera.
We didn't say it.
How have you survived? All the bad...
The answer is
not to keep asking yourself
how you do it as long as you do it.
I don't try and analyze it.
My luck hasn't run out yet.
<i>Onstage, does your mind wander off
or are you always in the guitar?</i>
I don't think onstage. I feel.
<i>Up there, you're just who you are.
You're not thinking.</i>
<i>When we get up there,
we're in our own little zone.</i>
We love what we do.
<i>As a man, what's Keith's best point?</i>
Well, he's very moral
and he's very caring, unlike his image.
In the bad old days or the good old days
was he really as mad
as all the books say?
- And were you?
- Yeah. And Keith still is.
And so am I, really.
Ronnie says that the hardest thing
is keeping up with you.
Generally in life.
And he thinks one of the reasons
he got the gig is
'cause he could stay the pace.
- Is he pretty tough?
- He's tough, but I wear him out.
Is Ronnie your right hand,
your left hand?
Is he your pal, your twin?
Good question.
Ronnie and I, we're like that.
And also we're like that.
Who's the best guitarist? You or Keith?
Oh, well, he knows I am.
- How would you answer that question?
- Nobody is interested in being the best.
- He said he was definitely the best.
- I know he'd say that. Yeah.
But I know the truth,
which is like, we're both pretty lousy,
but together we're better than 10 others.
<i>I guess you know the feeling.
Gold rings on you all. Bless you.</i>
<i>You're sounding good out there.</i>
<i>Thank you, Christina Aguilera.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
<i>All right! I loved it.</i>
<i>Are you feeling good?</i>
<i>Are you feeling good?</i>
<i>Come on and say, "Yeah. "</i>
<i>Thank you so much, everybody!</i>
<i>Good night, and thank you so much.</i>
<i>August 4th, 1972.</i>
<i>Cavett meets The Rolling Stones.</i>
Is there ever a temptation
when a whole audience is out there
waiting for you to chuck it,
and to just say, "I can't go on,
they're asking too much of me. "
You earn every cent
with that performance you give.
The exercise, the energy.
You lose probably 10 pounds a night.
- I can't remember the question.
- I can't either.
I've completely lost sight of it.
Yeah, there is a temptation
some nights.
When you have a real problem
to get there.
Like the other night
when we were in jail.
In jail?
Keith was on one side of this wall
and I was on the other.
And I say, "We're not gonna make it,
so let's forget about it
"and not try and make it. "
So Keith says, "We got to make it. "
So I say, "Okay, we'll make it. "
So we start yelling,
"We got to make it, we got to make it".
We didn't have to.
They did it all. They got us out.
Can you picture yourself at the age 60
doing what you do now?
- Yeah, easily, yeah.
- Really?
<i>Those lights are burning up my ass!</i>
<i>Thank you so much. Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you very much.</i>
Put my robe on right.
Go, go, go, go, go.
Up! Up!
<i>Ripped into failure.</i>
<i>So how's the audience gonna be
with all these cameras?</i>
