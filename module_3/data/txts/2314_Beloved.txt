For the past year...
I was at the jazz bar hoping that you would show up once ...
- Please once ...
- Stop it!
What is it that you are trying to say?
I shouldn't have come.
Give me one more chance.
I want to live ... with you.
Do you think I'd fall for such sweet words?
Choi Eun Hyok!
Do  want to sleep with me?
Do you want me to?
Then will you leave me alone?
I'm getting a divorce.
My mind is already made up.
Until your mind is made up
I will wait for your answer.
So ... you are saying ...
Because you are getting a divorce,
You want me to leave my husband?
Is that what you are saying now?
Chan Joo!
Don't touch me!
I'm not your woman.
Don't follow me.
I might call the police.
Thank you.
You came.
Are you okay?
You are not hurt, are you?
Are you okay?
Try this.
It will calm you down.
Because of some expensive materials...
Something like this happened only once before.
If I catch whoever did this...
he's dead meat.
Don't stay out too late.
Make sure you lock the door.
Don't wear anything too revealing.
Don't make it look like that
it's you living here alone.
Where have you been?
Uhm ...
I was worried. You weren't
answering the phone.
I wasn't?
The article wasn't going well,
so I went out to get some air.
How did it go in the office?  Did it go well?
It wasn't something serious, was it?
Oh ... it worked out well.
I will take a shower.
Okay, do you want me to turn on the heater?
No, thanks.
It's hot anyway.
- How about these clothes?
- Out!
- How about you guys?
- Here we go.
Hmm ... that's it.
That's really nice. Okay.
Everyone, let's get back to work, okay?
- Where should we put the special?
- In the second chapter.
Just now.
I got the confirmation about the interview from the executive office.
It's at 3pm, at her house in Chung Dam Dong.
You know, forget it.
Don't even worry about it.
I will just handle it myself.
You know what?
If it doesn't go well, I can just go find another job.
I have nothing to be scared of.
By the way
I really can't understand.
She was the one who took Choi Eun Hyok
away from you and married him.
It was three years ago.
It should be you who's upset.
Why is she all of a sudden trying
to make your life hell? Why?
Where did you move out to?
It's not a dry sauna.
And it's not a move-in-study room either.
Are you not going to tell me?
Do you have a boyfriend?
- Ah!
- Ran!
Are you okay?
- Let me see.
- Concentrate, will you?
You could've just told where you moved out to.
- Let me see, is it any better?
- It still hurts.
I'm sorry.
Han Soo!
I was on my way out from
the dance school construction site.
Right now?
Now is not a good time.
I have to go to the site in Ok Soo Dong.
- Why don't you ask Cho team leader?
- Mister.
Stop right there.
When somebody is hurt,
you don't even act like you noticed?
Never mind.
Are you busy?
- Hooray!
- Hey, stop it.
- This is nice.
- Hey!
Ran!
Let's go. I have to go to a construction site.
Mister can you come here?
Hurry!
Should a brief be better or a boxer?
What are you doing? You are embarrassing me.
Flashy PJs would be better right?
I don't wear anything like that.
Don't and put it back.
Who says it's for you?
I am going to hang it on the balcony
for security reasons.
You told me not to make it look like
there is only a woman in the house.
If so ...
Get this.
Polka dot boxer. This is nice.
Hmm ... you like polka dots, don't you?
Polka dots?
Perhaps ... you are wearing a polka dot boxer?
Hey, that's not it.
It's just ... it's rather normal than others.
You are, aren't you?
You are blushing up.
The editor said so many times that
I should take good care of you.
I'm loving it. I'll get to see how rich people,
especially our boss lives.
I think we should be almost there.
Could you wait here a little bit?
She is in the middle of her workout.
Please sit here.
Wow!
This is nice.
Oh, it's open there.
Wow, it's really big in here.
Oh, my gosh, it's a painting by Picasso.
I bet it is authentic. Wow.
No wonder that she majored in art in college.
It is certainly different.
Oh my gosh!
This must be her husband.
Wow.
Our master seems to have everything.
Money, status, beauty, artistic talent...
Plus, especially ...
a sexy husband ...
How long does our master have to workout for?
Manager.
We've been waiting for over an hour, haven't we?
Janie.
Are you a servant?
Excuse me?
Our master, matser ...
Do you really want to her her 'master'?
Well, it's just that ...
Well, everybody in the office calls her that.
Hurry.
Come on, Mister. Hurry up!
He's so slow.
I said I'd pay for the shipping.
I will go wash up a bit.
He is as weak as I thought.
Where are you going?
Are you going to the bathroom?
Janie, I'm sorry.
But tell her that I have to leave because
I have another appointment.
You want me to interview her by myself?
I can't do that by myself. Manager!
I'm ready now.
Oh, how are you?
You are home, honey.
Great timing.
These are the reporters of the magazine
company that I took over.
This is Moon Janie.
And ...
This is Seo Chan Joo.
It's the first day of my interview.
I'd love it, if you could join us.
How about it, reporters? It's okay, isn't it?
Of course, it's okay.
How about you, reporter Seo?
Why don't you join us?
If you do...
It will be a big help for the interview.
Looks like we need you now.
Han Soo.
Why don't you go to the hospital?
Wouldn't it be better?
For a good cause?
You let a girl move in the storage building.
That's not it.
I told you. When I was little,
That's not it.
I told you. When I was little...
She is a daughter of my teacher next door.
A daughter of your teacher? My butt!
That would be something
I used to say to my ex wife.
When did it start?
You finding her a place means
that you are really into her.
What are you talking about?
I didn't find her a place to see her privately.
That mattress ...
I caught you on the spot,
but you're still denying it?
She is pretty. Where did you meet her?
At a bar or through the Internet?
Looking at her red flashy dress ...
Does she dance at a bar?
Okay, I admit it. It probably didn't look good.
But come on, let's be rational. Think about it.
If what you say is true...
If this is what you think it is...
Wouldn't I hide her some place else?
My office is right around the corner.
It's just a matter of time when people
are going to know about this place.
Am I that stupid?
You should know this more than anybody.
- So it is not?
- It is not.
Really it's not?
I am telling you that it is not.
You are sure that it's not?
No, not at all!
You've almost fooled me.
Say it, say it!
Hey!
- Hey, why are you following me?
- Hey you!
Make her gone, do you understand?
Whether she's a sport dance athlete
or she just dances at a bar...
Is he hurt a lot?
- He didn't have to go to the hospital?
- No.
He's not hurt that much.
He's just shocked to know about
the situation because I didn't tell him.
Don't worry about it.
I will move out soon.
What are you talking about?
You don't have a place to go.
I can just move back to the dance studio.
This is not my first time.
Ran, you don't have to do that.
It's because he's a player...
He is mistaken about us now.
He thinks all men out there are like him.
I'm not him. What is he talking about? Nonsense!
Anyway.
Ran, don't worry about a thing.
I will take care of everything, okay?
Whew!
Why aren't you rich yet?
Then, I wouldn't feel this bad.
Why didn't you show up when you had more?
How can you not see me as a whole?
Hey, Ran!
I'm not that poor.
My annual income is high enough.
Weren't you under your wife's tight control?
You get your allowance...
And try to keep some money on the side.
And you get so weak to her.
What are talking about?
My wife and I ...
Are not that narrow-minded.
- Are you not?
- No, we are not.
If you know how fairly and reasonably we live...
- You will be surprised.
- Okay.
That's right.
And so many people wish that
they had what we have.
They say we are like friends,
lovers, siblings, etc.
And do you know what Han Soo told me before?
That we, we, we ...
Did I say I wanted to hear about you two?
Where are you going?
Never mind!
Hey, Ran!
Are you okay?
Is it the same spot?
Why care? You didn't even keep the promise.
By the way...
Who does he think he is to say that I dance at a bar?
How annoying!
I might not look like it, but I won more
than ten dance sport trophies.
Soon I'm going to the contest in London.
I'm going to make lots of money too and...
I'll become a member of the national
team and get famous.
Anyway!
And ...
It's not sport dance, but dance sport.
This is nice.
Wow, this is what I'd like too.
That is Monet.
How could you make a green house
like this inside the house?
I would've never guessed that there
is something like this inside a house.
He likes plants, so we built this when
we were getting ready to marry.
All year around...
We've been working hard to take good care of it.
Flowers that he likes.
Trees, wild flowers...
Cactus, even moss ... haha!
But he doesn't seem thrilled about it any more.
Wow, that is so romantic.
So this green house itself is so called a wedding present then?
Your husband must be so happy.
Why don't we stop with that story?
We might be boring them.
Oh, it is?
Are you bored, reporter, Seo?
No, not at all.
What the readers want to know about
is something intimate like that.
While we are at it...
Can I ask you more personal questions?
Go ahead.
People are still very interested in your marriage.
With an heiress to a conglomerate...
And an ordinary employee, their union is a dramatic story.
People get envious and curious.
On the other hand...
Some are uncomfortable with it.
Some are uncomfortable with it?
Is that true?
I didn't know about it because
of the painting and company.
I believe in destiny when it comes to love.
Marriage between people with similar conditions
was boring to me from the beginning.
When I met this guy for the first time
on our company's foundation day...
I knew it right away.
I wanted him to be mine.
I wanted to make a happy family with him.
So ...
You two are now ...
Happy?
Of course, we are.
Wow!
You were pretty tough in there.
I had no idea that you were
straight forward like that.
By the way, don't you think the
husband would be tired?
Even if you marry one of the rich girls
and enter a different world of money...
It could be very difficult for an ordinary
person to get used to ...
He looked like that a bit.
Is that why he looked so lonely?
My heart is fluttering.
He's lonesomely charismatic.
Can we go quietly, Janie?
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
No, I think I'm just tired.
Manager, you are relaxing now, aren't you?
You were all tense when we were inside the house.
Anyway, the rest of the interview
will be very interesting.
What was that about?
Didn't you want me here to discuss us?
Yes, it was .. about us, wasn't it?
You and me ...
And Seo Chan Joo.
Didn't we just talk about us?
Why are we having an interview like that
when we are about get a divorce?
You are surprisingly naive.
Do you really think that you can leave
me with a piece of paper like that?
By the way, she was surprisingly tough.
She was good at provoking others too.
But I wonder how long she can continue.
Leave her out of this.
- Talk to me.
- I'm still your wife.
Don't talk about other woman that way in front of me.
For the last three years...
In this house,
I was being a hunting dog.
Fetch, bark, rip, and guard!
Thanks to that, your life was so comfortable.
That's true.
But I don't want to live like this.
I will leave everything behind.
That is all I'm asking you not to do.
Did I ask for your heart?
You can just stay next to me like this.
Whether it's as a hunting dog or a butler.
Don't you try to put a dent on my reputation.
You know something?
The more you show me that side of you...
The tougher I get.
You ...
You will be ruined for life, if this continues.
That will be the end of you.
I'm ready for it.
That freaking we, we, we ...
Did I say that I wanted to hear about your 'we'?
Why bother? You didn't even keep the promise.
Han Soo, are you gone for the day yet?
I thought you had a date.
I looked like a panda.
She can't get pass that.
She wants to stop seeing.
Gosh, she doesn't deserve you.
Good that it ended.
And you ...
Did you tell the sport dance girl to move out?
It's not sport dance, but dance sport.
She is a dance sport athlete. She dances it as a sport.
Did I ask you what she does?
She has no where to go.
Where can I send her out to?
Take the rent out of my paycheck then.
Is that okay then?
Are you being all humanitarian again?
If you continue, you might become like me.
If you cheat, you get divorced.
You will have talimony taken too. Do you want that?
Slow down, you are way over your head.
- How can you say that?
- Enough said.
Let me ask you one thing.
Like you said, it's nothing.
You are just helping a daughter of
your teacher from your hometown.
But can you tell it all to Chan Joo?
Tough. I heard it from Moon Janie.
Chan Joo!
There is something you haven't told me, isn't there?
Just to be sure, I asked a reporter I know.
The couple ... they are having marital problems.
Baek In Kyung isn't doing this without
any reason, is she?
He ...
Said he wants to get a divorce.
He wants to live with me.
What?
See?
You can't, can you?
Something bothers you deep down, doesn't it?
If a couple keeps a secret about another person,
that's a dangerous sign.
Secrets will lead to lies. If lies get repeated,
it will lead to an affair.
Do you think that I cheated on my wife because
I wanted to have an affair at first?
You don't understand it.
I have this feeling of debt to her.
What are you talking about?
She lost her parents at the age of seven.
At the same time on the same day.
There was a car accident.
Their car was hit by a truck.
What is a little girl going to do?
<i>The day she moved in with her aunt</i>
<i>There is one thing she asked me of.</i>
Hold on!
Will you come and see me?
She asked me to come see her.
But that was it.
I told her that I would, but ...
But she still remembered that ...
So you feel bad that you couldn't keep
your promise to the poor girl next door.
So you can't turn your back to her
because of sympathy and responsibility?
So you will continue to stay close to her?
Are you kidding me?
Choi Eun Hyok must be crazy. Isn't he?
You two have your own family now.
What does he want after all these years?
I get the picture!
He got sold to a rich family and got bored.
And he comes back to his old girlfriend and says help me.
He looked very lonely.
His face during the interview.
When Baek In Kyung was going on
and on about how happy she was
I could tell that he was living in hell.
What is this? Are you saying
you pity him or something?
Chan Joo, just to be sure,
it will never happen, but ...
If you ever feel confused by him ...
No way! Never not even 1% ...
There you go!
Come on, wake up. This is your house.
This way. Wait a minute.
- Goodbye.
- Come to your senses. You're home.
- What is this?
- Uh, it's our house.
Yes, it is your house. Wake up, will you?
- Hello.
- Oh yes. Hello.
<i>Who wears sunglasses at night?</i>
<i>Where has she been in that outfit?</i>
No wonder why he wasn't answering his phone ...
She's so wasted.
- Who's that...?
- There she is!
- Oh my shoe.
- Your shoe!
- Here's your shoe.
- As expected.
I'm cold, husband.
Where's the sleeve?
The sleeve, dear. The sleeve.
Okay.
Should we just leave them here?
Let's ditch them.
Gosh, what a sick couple!
It was bad tonight.
By the way, long time no see.
I haven't seen you since Jin Sae's birthday.
How have you been?
You still all work and no play?
You are all about play then?
Well, I do what I do best.
By the way, have you done modeling before?
You knew? I did a little bit when I was young.
For this month's issue, we were planning a photo shoot of
a sexy man among successful young entrepreneurs.
But entrepreneurs don't seem too comfortable
about having a sexy image.
You have experience in that area and have an open-mind.
Are you trying to cast me?
Well ... I was just wondering ...
- What is it?
- Just hold on.
- What do you like to drink?
- Anything's fine.
By the way, why are you wearing the sunglasses at night?
I have my reason.
What kind of drink do you prefer?
Beer or hard liquor?
- Or soju mixed with beer?
- Soju with beer!
Okay then!
Can you move to the side?
<i>What kind of dream are we having?</i>
<i>A dreary dream?</i>
<i>A lonely dream?</i>
<i>A wonderful dream?</i>
Give me a chance.
Just this once.
I want to live with you.
<i>Dream that you can't get out of?</i>
<i>One thing for sure is that we are having
different dreams on the same bed.</i>
You woke up.
I'm making stew.
Let's eat.
- What are you doing?
- Making stew just for you.
Come on, you can use a cup.
How much did you drink last night?
I can't even remember.
How about you?
Not sure either.
I think I saw Myung Jin last night.
I think I saw Han Soo.
Let's pretend that we don't remember
anything about last night.
Okay.
Let's hurry. We don't want to be late.
- Sit here.
-Okay.
- Looks so good!
- Looks delicious.
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!
Looks yummy.
Is it good?
- That's how you react.
- Because it's good.
Honey, what if I quit my job?
What happened? I thought everything worked out.
Is Myung Jin making you work hard?
No, it's just that...
I'm a bit tired of the same work.
Maybe it's because I'm too relaxed.
Why? Should I not?
Honey, how can we live with
one paycheck these days?
The loan, interest, what we lost
from investing on the stocks ...
How can I take care of that all by myself?
No, you should continue to work.
You thought I'd say this?
I told you at the wedding.
I, Ko Jin Sae can take care of you just fine.
If you want to quit, go right ahead.
Is that why you got drunk last night?
Go ahead and eat.
This is so good. Your soup.
- Great, huh?
- Totally.
Are you up?
What are you doing here?
You wanted to go to some place quiet...
so, here we are in my office.
How could you drag me here?
I didn't drag you here!
You walked in here yourself.
You are making it sound bad.
It was very nice last night...
we even did a love shot.
Stop it. Just let it go, okay?
Forget about the whole thing.
Fine.
Then ... see you.
But the model coasting is still good, right?
I will wait to hear from you.
I can't believe that guy.
Hey! Hey!
- I'm here.
- Hello there.
There must have been some party here.
I told you to play upstairs.
Did you see anybody leave here?
What good is seeing a woman who drinks
at a guy's office late at night?
You know how I went to the President's wedding?
The wedding gifts...
It was a flower garden!
It was awesome!
The scale is different.
And her husband...wow.
He's totally sexy.
He looks like a movie star.
So my style.
Ran, are you okay?
Is that the same ankle again?
Let's just take her to the hospital. Hurry.
You're going to the hospital, right?
Get her in.
Do you know Ran?
Get Ran in. Hurry!
Be gentle, be gentle!
Put her down.
What are you doing Mister?
Ran, get out of the car. Now.
Get out now.
Don't worry, Ho Gee!
What are you two?
What a surprise! You've come to my room.
You have a hangover.
What is it you want to talk about?
I've been watching you for the last few days.
I believe it's time to show what
it is that you really want.
Interesting word choice, I should say.
But I wouldn't choose those words
to my boss if I were an employee.
I'm not your employee anymore.
So I will give it to you straight, Baek In Kyung.
Did two of you promise to hand out the resignation
letter and flee together or something?
He left a letter of resignation behind and disappeared.
Now you have to help me to find him.
Why should I? Why should I help you with that?
I'm sorry but I'm not interested
in your husband's whereabouts.
Whether you guys are happy, unhappy,
or getting a divorce, it's none of my business.
So leave me out of it,
and you take care of it yourself.
This is all I have to say.
Chan Joo, did you know that
you were paid thanks to him?
For the last three years, it was my husband who
was the faceless investor for your magazine.
What did you say?
Shocking, isn't it? I was too.
But you would turn your back from your savior
who is in need?
If he continues like this, he will lose everything.
He'd lose his place as the husband of the largest shareholder of Mun Ho Group.
Let me reveal one more thing while we are at it.
Because of you, I took over this company
that has been going under.
If you leave, do you think I'll keep this company alive?
Your colleagues of eight years, especially the editor,
Kang Myung Jin...their fate is in your hands.
Answer it!You bastard!
Thank you.
Are you sure that you are an athlete?
How can you not take good care of your body?
Did you not feel the pain around the ankle?
Okay, enough nagging.
I will be outside, so get some sleep.
I will ask them to turn off the light.
You could continue.
I don't mind hearing all that. Don't ask them
to turn the light off. I can't sleep.
Sorry that I couldn't keep my promise, Ran.
Get some sleep. I will be here until it's done.
This is something worth doing.
You've come looking for me.
You felt good about yourself while you
were helping me with the magazine?
If you had to leave like that, you should be happy.
Who asked you to help me?
Who asked you to help me with that?
If you thought I was touched by it and would come
running into your arms, you are mistaken.
Go back to where you belong.
That's the best.
The best for who? It is hell.
If you do this, don't you know it makes it hard for me
and the people around me?
Call me bastard! I deserve it all.
How? How are you going to take it?
Are you going to cut your leg off? Or go blind?
You will get the punishment from heaven.
You have no right to talk about it.
I will give up everything.
If I could, I would.
Could you stop by the subway station?
Just go.
I'm sorry, but please stop here.
Just keep driving.
I'm sorry. Please stop.
I'll get off here.
Okay, okay. Please take her to her house.
And leave the car at the parking lot on the name card.
Leave the key with the door man.
Just stay in here.
That's just how men are.
Sir, please stop the car.
Why me?
I said why me? Why!
If you left like that, you shouldn't have come back?
Why did you come back!
- It's just you.
- What does that mean?
What does that mean?
What's wrong with you?
It's you ... who I love is ... you.
You're crazy. You really are.
Will you ever listen?
Why do you keep on doing this to me?
Let go of me.
Let go!
You're the one I love.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
Why did you come out?
What if you catch a cold?
- It doesn't matter.
- What do you mean?
- Your leg is hurt.
- You'll get wet.
Hurry and run.
Hong Ran. You really don't listen.
If you catch a cold, ...
Why do you always do what you want?
Here.
Hurry and put it on.
Before you get sick.
Go home later and take a hot shower, okay?
I've decided to like you.
I don't care whether you are married or else.
Ran ...
I'm going.
Mister, I really liked you today.
Are you hurt?
I'm sorry.
Subtitles by DramaFever
I called you because I had something to say.
Just hear me out.
Can you make some time tomorrow?
Hey, I don't know who it is,
but whoever's sending you out on this...
I don't need things like that okay?
Get off me!
Will you stay until I sleep?
What I was trying to tell you...
Even when he gave me the divorce papers,
it didn't feel this awful.
This is what I had to tell you.
