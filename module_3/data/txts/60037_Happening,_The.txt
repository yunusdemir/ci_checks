- Come on!
- Ha, ha.
I forgot where I am.
You're at the place where the killers need
to decide what to do with the crippled girl.
Oh, that's right. That's right.
Did you hear that?
That's funny.
That's weird. Those people look
like they're clawing at themselves.
Is that blood?
Claire, you seeing this?
Claire.
Claire? Claire?
What page was I on?
What page?
- We need an extension over here.
- Pull back!
Give me, like, another 20 feet.
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.
I told you he wouldn't do it.
So then the little guy says,
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy too?
Well, I saw your thing
and it said 'W.Y.'
The big guy says, "No, man.
Mine says 'Welcome to Jamaica.
Have a nice day."'
Christ. McKenzie fell.
M-Medic. We have a major accident
at the south side of the building.
- We'll need an ambulance.
- Copy.
Jesus.
Give him some room.
- Hey!
- Somebody fell!
- Davis?
- That guy just fell! Someone fell!
Over at that building!
Oh, my God!
- Watch it!
- Oh, my God!
- Watch it!
- Get out of there!
- Hey, someone - Help!
- Look out!
Christ! Just go! Look out!
God in heaven.
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article ...
in the New York Times
about honeybees vanishing.
Well, apparently, honeybees are
disappearing all over the country.
Tens of millions of them
just disappearing.
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.
It's scary, huh?
Let's hear some theories about
why this might be happening.
Nothing? Come on, guys.
- Laura.
- Disease?
Right. Could be a virus or infection.
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.
It's a little tricky.
- Pollution?
- Could be.
I mean, we're just pumping so much junk into
the environment, they're just keeling over.
But there are no bodies.
Keep guessing.
- Dylan.
- Global warming.
Temperature goes up a fraction of a degree,
makes them disoriented. Maybe.
Jake?
You don't have an opinion?
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?
You should be more interested
in science, Jake. You know why?
Because your face is perfect.
The problem is your face
is perfect at 15.
Now, if you were interested
in science, you would know facts ...
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.
So a perfect balance of features now might
not look so perfect five years from now.
They might look downright
whack 10 years from now.
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science. What could
be a reason the bees have vanished?
An act of nature
and we'll never fully understand it.
Nice answer, Jake. He's right.
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books ...
but in the end it'll be just a theory.
I mean, we will fail to acknowledge ...
that there are forces at work
beyond our understanding.
To be a good scientist ...
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.
- Jake?
- How much does the human nose grow each year?
It's minuscule, buddy, okay?
Don't worry about it.
You're gonna be a heartthrob your
whole life. I was just messing with you.
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.
Whoo!
Vice Principal. What can we do for you?
I'm afraid I have to interrupt
you for a moment, Mr. Moore.
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.
What is that?
I've never seen anything like it.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
You excused all the teachers?
The administration makes us teach with a
foot of snow on the ground. What is this?
Elliot!
All right.
There appears to be
an event happening.
Central Park was just hit by what
seems to be a terrorist attack.
- Oh, no.
- They're not clear on the scale yet.
It's some kind
of airborne chemical toxin ...
that's been released
in and around the park.
 They said to watch for warning signs.
The first stage is confused speech.
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.
The third stage is fatal.
Central Park? That's kind of odd.
I spoke with the head of the schools.
He said we should
dismiss the students.
So take your planners home, so we
can get back when this is over.
All right? Let's do our jobs.
You guys still got to work on your
science projects for next week.
What are the rules
of scientific investigation?
Identify variables, design the experiment ...
careful observation and measurement,
interpretation of experimental data.
Hey, guys?
Nothing.
Go back to the laughing, please.
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.
People -- People are comforted by percentages.
Didn't work. She still wants us to get
out of the city and come out to her house.
But she said for
you and Alma to come.
Yeah. Let me think about that, okay?
Did you hear about New York?
Are you okay?
No, I mean are you okay?
Yeah, me too. Listen,
I want to talk about it more.
Julian's mom offered for all of us
to stay with her.
What do you think?
I'll bring Jess and Evette and
I'll meet you at the station.
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?
- What's going on?
- She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?
- Odd?
- Look, if she's acting like
she's distant or something.
- What?
- I can't say any more.
- Is she leaving you?
- I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?
Hey.
I'm gonna tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.
Why is everybody saying that?
I saw her on your wedding day.
Again with the wedding. What?
I walked into a waiting room
by mistake and she was crying.
She looked up. I saw her face.
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.
So do federal,
state and local officials ...
have a plan in place for
this type of catastrophe?
Are they utilizing all the
manpower, the money --
- Hi.
- Are you packed?
- Yes.
- What are they saying?
They're evacuating New York City.
Well, our brains come equipped
with a self-preservation mechanism ...
to stop us from harmful actions.
This is controlled
by a combination ...
of electrochemical
signals in the brain.
The blocking of neurotransmitters
by certain toxins ...
has been proven
to cause hallucinations ...
asphyxiation and paralysis.
This new neurotoxin is basically ...
flipping the preservation switch ...
blocking neurotransmitters
in a specific order ...
causing specific self-damaging
and catastrophic effects.
Just how the toxin works,
it makes you kill yourself.
Just when you thought there
couldn't be any more evil ...
that could be invented.
I'll be packed in two minutes.
Hello?
- No need to rush.
- Sir. Thank you.
Sir, we'll need to
check your suitcase.
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!
This just in to the Eyewitness Newsroom,
and it's the latest development.
Autopsies on the
first victims confirm ...
the toxin is a natural compound.
The attacks remain confined to
the New York metropolitan area.
This is a very, very disturbing story.
Track 3 now boarding for Harrisburg.
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?
She was at a shop across town. She got stuck
in traffic. She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.
- No. She wanted us to get on this train with Jess.
- She'll feel a lot safer. Where's Alma?
- Restroom.
Please have your tickets out and ready.
I bought them.
it was like getting one of those "Cabbage
Patch Dolls" when they first came out.
- What a madhouse. How are you?
- Good. You?
Good.
- Okay. Good. Why don't we --
- I'm really glad you chose to come.
Thanks. Um, Elliot,
can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.
- Have your tickets out, please.
- You told him about our fight?
No.
- Why did he say that?
- He guessed.
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.
I'm not that type of person.
Elliot, these are our problems.
I am upset.
I'm gonna sit alone and cool off.
By the time we get there, I'll be fine.
- Is that okay?
- Fine.
I'm gonna get on the train.
We're not gonna get to sit together anyways.
Okay.
- Hey, babe.
- Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?
- Hanging in there.
Me too.
- What's wrong with you?
- What?
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.
- Come on, don't get all sensitive.
- Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help --
- I don't want your help. Duh.
- Okay. I heard it.
- Jess, could you ask your dad for my ticket, please?
Thank you.
See you on the train, Jess.
Track 3 now boarding
all ticketed passengers.
Here we go.
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.
- I'm serious. Come on. Come on.
- Mom --
I know. I know you don't want to.
- Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?
You've got to stop calling me. You're
acting like the "Fatal Attraction" guy here.
I feel like I'm gonna take a shower and see
your silhouette on the shower curtain.
We ate tiramisu together. That is it.
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.
What?
When? In Philadelphia?
- Well, I don't know.
What did you hear?
- What's the news?
- Apparently Philadelphia was just attacked.
- Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy! Call Mommy!
Honey! Honey, yeah, where are you?
What? What? I - I can't hear you.
I said I can't hear you! Text me.
Text me. I can't hear you!
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.
Another park?
- Hey, she got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.
I know, baby. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.
I want to talk to her.
... get themselves out.
- Hello?
- Do you have a phone?
- No, no. I'm sorry. I don't.
- You okay?
- They say Boston got hit too.
- Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.
What the hell is going on, Elliot?
I honestly don't know.
Now what?
We just stopped. I don't know.
They're not telling us anything.
- Sir?
- Train service has been discontinued.
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.
Well, hey.
What do you mean?
Where are we?
Filbert, Pennsylvania.
Filbert? Does anybody
know where that is?
Why are you giving me one useless piece
of information at a time? What's going on?
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.
- Sir, we lost contact.
- With whom?
Everyone.
I'm scared.
I don't like it here.
- I want Mom.
- Don't be silly. We're safe here. Okay?
Look at me. See?
I'm sorry. She whispers
to us when she gets scared.
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions either.
- She's shivering.
- I know. She's never right without her mom.
- It's okay.
- They're not saying anything.
We're stuck here.
is Jess okay?
She's not talking.
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.
Don't know what you want?
Just have the grilled cheese,
with milk. Come over here.
No. You know what? Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.
What? All right, you want to come with me?
You can come and wait in line?
Bro, I got it. Go get the milk.
All right, yeah. Okay.
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?
It's scientifically proven.
They got these cameras that can record what
color you are when you're feeling different things.
People that are angry give off
a different color than people that are sad.
See this ring? This ring can
supposedly tell you what you're feeling.
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.
Oh, yellow. That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.
You must be about to laugh or something.
It's probably just about to come out.
We'll wait.
We got all day.
Oh, my God. There it is.
Cool. That ring really works.
That's amazing.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.
My sister sent it to me. It was taken
an hour ago at the Philadelphia Zoo.
Oh, I think he's gonna feed them.
Mother of God. What kind
of terrorists are these?
They're not sure it's terrorists now.
Moments ago,
in an official statement ...
the government moved away
from its initial position ...
that this was a terrorist attack.
Authorities are now feeling, by the sheer
number of incidents being reported ...
that a terrorist group being responsible
is becoming less and less likely.
The event appears to be
limited to the Northeast ...
where smaller and smaller towns
are being attacked.
- Where are we?
- The affected area now includes
most of New England ...
from Massachusetts to Maryland.
We're dead center.
Everything okay?
Smaller towns --
if we stay here,
we are gonna die here.
Whatever this is ...
it looks like it's not occurring
about 90 miles from here.
Let's go.
... go by car?
Can anyone give us a ride?
Hey!
Excuse me, sir?
Sir, can we get a ride, please?
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.
Did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation.
We have a little girl with us.
Please. Sir?
- Drive. Just roll up the window.
- Sir!
You're not just gonna --
Can you believe how
crappy people are?
There's a car.
Um, hi. I, uh -- I run
a plant nursery up the street.
We're, uh, picking up
a few things from home ...
then heading ...
wherever this isn't happening.
We-we have room.
- We have two others.
- That's okay.
Julian!
Is Julian okay?
We got a ride.
He can fit all of us.
Elliot, I can't get Evette
on the phone or e-mail or nothing.
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.
She was on that bus
headed to Princeton.
There's a car over there headed
to pick up friends and family.
 They said they could
squeeze one more.
Gotta go.
Look. Think real carefully about this.
She was looking for a birthday present
for Jess. Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.
Look, I'm just gonna go get her, and I'm gonna
bring her back, and I'm gonna find you guys.
I just -- I need -- I need you to take Jess, okay?
She's gonna be a lot safer with you.
Don't do this to me.
I'm doing my best here
not to fall down.
I'm sure the probability
of Princeton not being hit is good.
Yeah. You want me to throw some figures
and percentages at you so we both feel better?
- Please.
- All right.
Sixty-two percent chance --
Sixty-two percent chance
it hasn't even been hit.
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man.
This is all some weird event, that's all.
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.
- I have to go.
- I got her, Julian.
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.
Okay.
I'm gonna go get Mommy.
Hold our picture.
Okay.
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.
We're packing hot dogs for the road.
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.
They got a cool shape.
They got protein.
You like hot dogs, right?
By the way --
I think I know what's causing this.
- You do?
- It's the plants.
They can release chemicals.
You like hot dogs, don't you?
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going ...
but we will be back soon, okay?
Oh. Plants react to human stimulus.
They proved it in tests.
Did you get the mustard?
Don't look outside.
Stop it! Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!
Close the vents.
I'm gonna give you
a math riddle, okay?
- And you're gonna tell me the answer.
- What?
How much -- How much would you have ...
if I said I would pay you
a penny on the first day ...
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day ...
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?
- Ten dollars.
- No. Higher, higher, higher.
Just - just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.
- Twenty dollars?
- No, keep going. Keep going.
Thirty. It's 30. It's $30.
Want me to tell you the answer?
It's over $10 million.
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.
Do you want to hear another one?
Water contamination has surfaced ...
as one of the many theories
being taken seriously ...
as to the cause of the
events in the Northeast.
We have to go through
this little community of homes.
A small town called Holcomb.
Then we hit the highway.
From there we're 30 miles
from the state line.
Okay.
Are those dead animals up ahead?
Stop the car.
- You don't think it's -
- I don't know.
You got binoculars in the back from
when you were spying on our neighbors.
- Can I have the map?
- Elliot.
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.
It's bodies, isn't it? I knew it would
be bodies. How could it not be bodies?
Please, give me the map.
We have to turn around. There's a right
turn about a quarter of a mile back.
We're just gonna take
a different route, honey, okay?
Oh, it's the army. We're safe.
My name is Private Auster.
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 -- 10 miles back.
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.
I lost communication with them.
When I approached the base,
I saw military personnel ...
in the barbed wire -- in the fence --
so I suggest no one take that road.
This town about
eight miles behind us-
There were bodies
on the road into town.
Cheese and crackers.
Well, that still leaves us two directions.
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?
- We have no communication.
- We don't have a cell phone.
- I'll talk to them.
- You see anything out of the ordinary on the road?
Hello! Please stop!
Excuse me.
- Who's Joey?
- Oh, it's no one.
- Any luck?
- I can't get Julian on his cell phone.
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.
Has anyone seen any other
people on the roads?
- Walking or --
- Maybe he's onto something.
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.
Why did it start in parks?
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back -
They say there's a bus in a lake.
F-Five miles back,
there were dozens of bodies.
Okay.
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.
There's a woman talking to her daughter.
She's talking to her daughter in Princeton.
- Isn't that where your friend went?
- Come on.
It's okay. Honey -- Honey, it's okay.
You -- She's so scared.
You just -- You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.
Just keep watching out
the window with the tree, baby.
- Someone will come and get you soon.
- Tell her --
Tell her not to go near
the window with the tree. Just tell her.
Baby, don't go near
the window with the tree.
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.
Honey, someone wants to know
if-if-if Princeton's had any problems.
She says everyone's dead outside.
You just stay in your room. You --
Honey?
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?
- What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?
Stace - Stacey, you're scaring me.
I - I - I don't understand
what you're saying.
What, baby? I --
She's just not making any sense.
Calculus.
I see ... in calculus.
- Calculus.
- Stacey.
- Calculus.
- Stacey!
Stacey Ann! No!
Oh, my God!
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Stacey. Stacey. Stacey.
Oh, no.
- Oh, no!
- She'll be okay.
... her daughter in Princeton.
Oh, damn. Oh, no.
I don't know how old she is,
but this is her mother.
I don't think she has
anything goin' on.
We're gonna go back
to the car, okay, Jess?
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?
Oh. Come here. Come here.
I just walked down a quarter mile.
It was clean.
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean.
No bodies, no nothing.
A quarter mile.
- That's not enough.
- It's better than goin' back -
That'll give us a battle plan.
Everybody will make a clean break.
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?
Yeah. He never gives up.
You know, plants have
the ability to target specific threats.
Tobacco plants, when attacked
by heliothis caterpillars ...
will send out a chemical, attracting wasps
to kill just those caterpillars.
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.
They-They just evolve very rapidly.
Which species do you think
is doing it, if you think it's true?
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.
Trees can communicate with bushes,
bushes with grass and everything in between.
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities ...
- then went to the towns, and now the roads.
- That's right.
Whatever is happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.
So we shouldn't be
on the roads then.
The terrorists, or whatever,
could be watching the roads.
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.
We're in the area of attack.
if you can't find a way
through the area of attack ...
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.
They're attacking populations.
We need to go where
there aren't that many people --
Where people don't travel.
Now, this is Mr. Collins.
He's a Realtor that works in this area.
if we go west, we'll hit
a county called Arundell.
It's not on that map.
It would only be on local maps.
Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?
We should go into two groups.
Those that are ready
to go right now ...
and those that need to
get things from their cars.
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together!
- We'll go soon, honey. We'll go soon.
- Mmm. Mmm.
Maybe we should have
waited for the rest of them.
Stayed in a big group
like the private said.
Your phone's out too?
What's wrong?
Okay, I was gonna tell you. Okay?
There was this guy.
Joey. His name is Joey.
He's at work.
We went out, and we had dessert.
I went out and I had
dessert with him ...
when I told you I worked late,
and I didn't work late.
And I'm feeling really guilty. In case we're
gonna die, I just wanted you to know that.
You lied to me?
- How much further is it now?
- How you doing?
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who made you boss?
If y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
If you follow me, you're gonna live.
I'm in charge of this group.
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group.
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!
Private Auster?
My firearm is my friend.
Jesus.
- Oh, no.
- What "Oh, no"?
Is it the toxin?
The toxin is affecting them?
Are those people killing themselves?
You were with the private.
What do we do?
- We need to do something.
- Just let me think.
They're dying.
- I need a second.
- They released it? We're not near the roads.
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers.
I need a second, okay?
Just give me a second.
We're not gonna be one
of those assholes on the news ...
who watches a crime happen
and not do something.
- We're not assholes.
- Just a second!
- There were children in that group.
- Please tell us what to do.
I need a second, okay?
Why can't anybody give me
a goddamn second?
All right, be scientific, douche bag.
identify the variables.
That's the two groups.
Design an experiment.
That's where we begin.
Careful observation and measurement.
That's what I'm trying to do.
interpret the experimental data.
interpret.
What if it is the plants?
Their group was larger than ours.
This thing has been
escalating all day.
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.
They react to human stimulus.
Maybe people are
setting off the plants.
What are you saying?
That guy was crazy. We have to save them.
They're already dead.
What if they're
targeting us as threats?
This part of the field may
not have been set off.
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air ...
when there's too many of us together.
Let's just stay ahead of the wind.
Let's just break up into groups.
Come on, come on!
This way! Follow me!
I'm here. Right here. Keep going.
Come on. Come on.
Here it comes.
Don't you let go of my hand.
Nothing happened.
It was the size of the groups, I think.
Could this really be happening?
What are your names?
- Jared.
- Josh.
Wait, wait.
I'm gonna go see
if that truck has a map.
You guys wait here.
Why aren't they looking
into nuclear power plants?
There are 15 or more
in the Northeast alone ...
more than anywhere else
in the United States.
There's probably
been some leak or something.
It's probably poisoning the air.
There's a house over there!
Come on!
It could have been
some terrorist booby trap.
Someone stepped on it
out in the field.
- Yeah, in a field in "Bumbletown, Pennsylvania."
- I don't know.
Look. A toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent
in a certain density.
The source had to be close
to that field, if not in the field.
Here's one.
Plants have a chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.
You think it could be plants?
I don't know.
But if it is, and people
are setting it off in groups ...
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.
We can't walk to the borders
where this is not happening. It's too far.
Whatever it is --
terrorists, a nuclear leak, plants --
It's probably safe
to get away from people right now.
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.
Okay, this place
must have a bathroom.
- I'm gonna take Jess, and we can leave.
- Hurry.
Hello?
My name is Elliot Moore.
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner ...
giving off good vibes.
We're just here to use the bathroom.
Then we're just gonna leave.
I hope that's okay.
Plastic.
I'm talking to a plastic plant.
I'm still doing it.
You guys ready to leave?
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving
the front door unlocked?
Hey, everything's fake.
Why is this happening?
I don't know for sure, Josh.
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.
It hadn't been around
for billions of years.
it just appeared in the water.
It's toxic to humans. Fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.
It feels kind of similar
to that, with the bees disappearing?
I mean, I don't know.
It feels like a pattern.
The nature of events
like the one in Australia ...
is that they crest and then stop.
We just have to be alive
when it's over.
- I don't believe it's nature.
- It may not be.
It could be some other explanation.
l don't know.
Let's go.
There are people coming.
We can't stay here.
It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.
There's two groups coming together.
There's too many of them together.
Run. Run.
- Is she your kid?
- No.
- You got kids?
- No.
- How come? You got a problem?
- No.
- She wanted to wait.
- Really? For what?
For me to grow --
Why are we talking about this?
Oh, sweet. I used to love those.
Could I see it?
You need to take, uh,
personal responsibility ...
for yourself in a relationship.
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.
- Yeah, man.
- Hey, that's not a toy. It's got meaning to me.
Elliot! Look.
Come on.
Oh, wow.
... an emergency broadcast.
All those who are still inside
the affected area of the Northeast ...
are asked to proceed
to the police borders ...
- west of your state.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- This is an emergency broadcast.
... inside the affected area --
Jess needs a 10-minute
rest and some food.
Are you sure?
We should keep going.
I know, but she's only eight.
What?
if we're gonna die,
I want you to know something.
I was in a pharmacy a while ago.
There was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.
Really good-looking. I went up
and I asked where the cough syrup was.
I didn't even have a cough ...
and I almost bought it.
I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.
That's, like, six bucks.
Are you joking?
Thank you.
Maybe that's not a good idea.
I told her just for a minute.
- Mr. Moore, I think I can open this door.
- Wait.
We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.
We're just gonna get
some food for Jess.
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.
I mean, it's all boarded up.
Maybe we could leave some money.
What kind of tree is this?
I think it's a maple.
Not so high.
Okay, Josh, open the door.
Wait!
I see something.
There's somebody in there.
- You sure?
- Yeah. I saw him move.
I see him.
Let's stop.
Is there any way
we could get some food?
We have a little girl.
We just wanna get her some food.
You best leave now. You ain't gonna
bring that poison gas in here with you.
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.
Nothing's happened out here yet.
I mean, you could see that.
Just listen to our voices.
We're perfectly normal.
♪ Oh, black water Keep on rolling ♪
♪ Mississippi moon
won't you keep on shining on me ♪
See? We're normal.
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.
Okay. It's not worth it.
- Open the door, bitch!
- Hey, Josh, don't do that.
- He didn't mean that.
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.
- Stop it, Jess.
Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.
Best not let that gas in here.
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.
You might be with the terrorists.
I don't think it's terrorists, sir.
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore.
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in --
No!
Jared!
We're gonna get out
of this nightmare.
Elliot.
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.
Okay?
You've got to three
to get of four porch.
Come here. Come here.
No new people have crossed
over the border for a few hours.
It appears those residents
that are still ...
in the affected area of
the Northeast are trying to wait it out.
We have Professor Kendel Wallace of
Carnegie Mellon, a statistician, here with us.
Professor, what can you tell us?
Calculating by the rise in intensity ...
of reports of incidents
within the affected area ...
one can guess at a crude timetable.
Uh, one can see the incident
is rising in sensitivity.
It would seem fewer and fewer people
can provoke the attacks.
Uh, the event should be
at its most sensitive tomorrow morning.
Typically, these type of slopes
drop precipitously after cresting ...
meaning it could end suddenly
at any moment.
Of course, these
are only probabilities.
There are some quiet rumblings
that the government ...
may be involved in the tragic events
playing out in the Northeast.
Now, these rumors
have been fueled ...
by the statements
of a confidential informant ...
who claims that the C.I.A.
has facilities in the Northeast ...
where they are testing drugs with
some similar psychotropic properties ...
as a defense against chemical weapons.
C.I.A. and White House officials have
declined to respond to these accusations.
Perimeters have been set up
all along the East Coast ...
from Maryland
all the way to Massachusetts.
This house has no power going to it.
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.
Let me go. You guys stay right here.
That's for Clement.
He's a retriever.
You lost?
You must be.
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?
I suppose the kind thing
for me to do is to offer you supper.
I ain't gonna ask you again.
I hope the meal was sufficient.
I wasn't expecting guests.
This is a beautiful place.
There's a springhouse in the back.
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.
It has a speaking tube ...
running under the ground
to the main house.
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.
So what's with you two?
Who's chasing who?
I'm sorry?
Ain't no time two people
staring at each other ...
standing still, love in both their eyes ...
at the same time, equal.
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.
That's the way we's built.
So who's chasing?
I knew that. I knew that.
Don't touch things
that aren't yours.
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.
I got enough to fill my time right here.
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.
Although I ain't got the touch.
Gardens don't grow
the way they should. Never have.
How do you stay in contact with others?
I don't.
How would you know if something
were to happen, like a world event?
Mrs. Jones, um ...
something's happened
along the East Coast.
Whatever it is that you think is so important
that you need to tell me, don't.
Just keep it to yourself.
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.
Suppose I have to let you spend the night.
Guest room's up on the left.
Mind the steps.
I'm scared, Elliot.
It's okay.
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.
You've been great
taking care of Jess.
I don't like this woman.
There's something
"Exorcist-y" about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?
We need to stay in this house.
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.
Let's just deal with her.
I hear you whispering.
- Planning on stealing something?
- No, ma'am, we're not.
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?
What? No.
Mrs. Jones?
Crazy lady.
You trying to steal my things?
No. No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.
You all are gonna leave right now.
Ma'am, you don't understand.
There's something happening
in a few states.
- In this region it's not safe.
- Leave now!
The Lord is my shepherd.
The Lord is my shepherd.
Mrs. Jones, could we
talk calmly for a second?
Please hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher.
Mrs. Jones?
Oh, my God.
Alma, shut the windows and the doors!
Alma?
Alma?
Alma?
Jess?
Hi, froggy.
Hi, frog.
Over here. Over here.
Wait. Up!
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby?
I think he's a baby.
He's so tiny. I didn't know frogs
could be that tiny.
He got water on my shoe.
isn't this a cool house?
if we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.
Wait. Get him again.
Get him again.
Hey, froggy.
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.
Close the windows
and the doors, Alma.
Why?
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.
Close the door, Jess.
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.
I'm sorry, Alma.
What's going on, Elliot?
It's happening here.
It could be the grass
and the trees are doing this now.
She was alone when it happened.
Seems like they might
have gotten more sensitive.
It's too dangerous to go
outside, isn't it?
Yes.
This is the end, isn't it?
I wish you were here.
Me too.
You remember our first date?
You were so quiet.
You bought me the mood ring.
It turned purple when you wore it.
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."
It got you to talk, didn't it?
Then-Then we checked
the little paper chart ...
and it turned out that
purple meant I was horny.
You loved that.
I had no idea.
Yours was blue.
- Peaceful, right?
- Right.
What color was love?
I don't remember.
Me neither.
Elliot?
Yeah?
I was just making sure you're there.
It's not right for it to end like this.
if we're going to die,
I want to be with you.
l want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come be with you.
Elliot, don't.
The event must have ended
before we went out there.
I found the hair clip.
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.
Oh, wait.
Um, I'm just gonna
put this right here.
Okay?
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma.
I love you.
I love you too.
All right. Pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?
Good-bye.
As everyone knows by now,
traces of the neurotoxin ...
have been found
in some plants and trees.
Now most environmentalists
feel that this event ...
is like -- like the red tide in the ocean ...
but instead of algae killing fish,
this happened on land.
Plants and trees just can't
pick up and move ...
when they feel threatened,
like other species.
They have only one option:
to rapidly evolve their chemistry.
Well. Uh, Kay from Mississippi ...
wants to know why it started
so suddenly -- on a Tuesday at 8:33 --
and then ended so suddenly
at 9:27 the next morning.
Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest ...
um, this was an act of nature ...
and we'll never fully understand it.
And, Doctor, there's been
a lot of speculation ...
as to why this happened
in the Northeast only.
How do you explain that?
I believe - All right?
And this is just my opinion.
That this was a prelude --
A warning, like -- like -
like the first spot of a rash.
We have become a threat
to this planet.
I don't -- I don't think anybody
will argue that. And this is a warning.
A warning? See, I think
the skeptics would believe that ...
if it had occurred anywhere else.
That's why most people
believe it was the government.
If it had happened
in one other place, anywhere else ...
we could all believe
what you're saying.
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.
That frightened me.
That frightened me.
I should drop my bicycle off
What?
My God ...
My bicycle.
