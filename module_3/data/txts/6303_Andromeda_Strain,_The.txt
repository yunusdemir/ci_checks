ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This film concerns
the four-day history of
a major American scientific
crisis. We received the help of
many people attached to Project
Scoop and at the Wildfire Laboratory
They encouraged us
to tell the story accurately.
The documents presented here
are soon to be made public.
They do not in any way
jeopardize the national security.
First day
Piedmont, New Mexico. Population 68.
Come on.
I didn't notice them before.
I didn't know buzzards fly at night.
That's what they look like.
Here.
Boy, that's some dead burg.
Buzzards only come
when something's dead.
I guess we'd better go in
and have a look.

'This is Caper One to Vandal Deca.
Caper One to Vandal Deca.
- 'Are you reading? Over. '
- Yes, I'm reading. Over.
'We're about to enter Piedmont
and recover the satellite. '
- Very good. Leave your radio open.
- 'Roger. '
'We're now inside the town.
'It's kind of spooky.
I see a church steeple ahead on the left. '
'It's quiet here.
'It's the damnedest thing,
there's no sign of life.
'The signals from the satellite
are getting very strong. '
'Sir!
Did you see that, Lieutenant?'
- 'See what?'
- 'By the fence. It looks like a body. '
'Easy, Crane. You're imagining things. '
- 'Holy Toledo!'
- 'Sir, it's another one. '
'You're right. It looks dead. '
- 'Yes, sir. Shall I, er...?'
- 'No, stay in the van. '
- What's happening?
- 'We see bodies, lots of them. '
- Are you certain?
- 'Dammit, of course we're certain!'
Your orders are...
proceed to satellite and retrieve.
'Roger, Vandal Deca. '
Stay at your stations.
Hit that security button.
- Get me Major Manchek.
- 'They don't look dead. '
- 'There must be dozens of them. '
- Dammit, get this call through.
'It's like they just dropped
in their tracks, sir.
'Sir!'
- 'Good Christ!'
- 'See that thing in white?'
'It's coming toward us. '
Major, this may sound crazy
but something strange is going on.
'Sir, I think we should get out of... '
Hello, Ops. This is Major Manchek.
Scoop Control A-12.
We need a flyby
over Piedmont, New Mexico.
Infrared, a FLIR scan all sectors.
Film to come direct to Scoop.
Assign Gunner Wilson,
if he's not crocked someplace.
Jeez.
I'm declaring a state of emergency.
All personnel restricted to base.
- Everything in that room is top-secret.
- Yes, sir.
'This is a recording. State your name
and your message and hang up. '
Major Arthur Manchek,
Scoop Mission Control, A-12.
I recommend calling a Wildfire Alert.
We have film evidence of death caused
by Scoop Vll returning to earth.
Time check,
zero-one-four-seven inclusive.
I won't wear wool next to my skin
so Herbert had to refuse
the chair at Minnesota.
We'd like to see Dr Jeremy Stone, please.
Well, I'm Mrs Stone
and we are having a party. May I...
Does that man have a gun?
Ma'am, we must see Dr Stone.
- What is this?
- Please call Dr Stone to the door.
Otherwise we'll go get him, ma'am.
Just a minute.
I'll just wait here, ma'am.
I'll come to Berkeley any time, Stone.
Four million is a large Federal grant.
May I see you, Jeremy?
The SDS has arrived, no doubt.
There are some Army types in the hall
and two outside with guns.
- They want to see you.
- I'll take care of it.
- Jeremy! If you knew about this...
- I didn't. I'll explain later.
I'm Dr Stone.
Yes. I'm Captain Morton.
There's a fire, sir.
- I've got to leave.
- For God's sakes, Jeremy.
- When will you be back?
- I'm not sure.
- The guns, is it...
- It's our job to protect your husband.
- Nothing must happen to him.
- I'll be as safe as in your arms.
Jeremy? Jeremy?!
You tell the Senator it's his daughter.
'Allison?'
Dad, something strange just happened,
even for Jeremy.
A few minutes ago...
Dad? Are you there? What's going on?
'This communication
is being monitored
'and has been broken
for reasons of national security.
'You will be briefed later. Thank you
for your cooperation, Mrs Stone. '
- I feel like Onassis.
- It's the fastest thing we could arrange.
Thanks.
- Yes?
- General Sparks here.
I wanted to inform you that all members
of your team have been called in...
except for Professor Kirke,
who's in hospital.
You'll get complete details
with your team.
You talk like you've been brainwashed.
- You don't understand.
- Germ warfare people? A lab accident?
Thank you. It's different.
Don't pack, Claire, I won't need anything.
A hippie. He's going to a love-in.
I give up.
One minute you're fed up.
You talk about retiring - to Alaska!
- Now you're a cloak-and-dagger man.
- My glasses.
- Here they are, Dad.
- Can't you even tell me who phoned?
Grandpa, Grandpa!
There's a car and they got guns.
Do they, now?
That's serious. I'll watch out.
- Honey, you've been dreaming.
- I wish I were.
No. Get someone else.
Dr Leavitt, I told you there's a fire.
My experiment's at the critical stage,
I can't just leave now.
- I want that new plate read.
- Yes, ma'am.
My orders come from Dr Robertson,
the President's science adviser.
There's a phone. Pick it up. Call Robbie.
Tell him I burnt my draft card.
Are you sick?
We have a physician on call.
All Dr Leavitt needs is rest.
Knock it off, Bess.
- If the physician
certifies that you can't...
No.
I'm fine.
Relax.
I'm going with you.
Skin knife.
'Mark, sorry to disturb you.
'There was a call from a Dr Robertson
at the White House.
'Your orders are to break scrub. '
Orders? I got a patient all ready.
'Kelly will take over for you.
'You're expected
in the surgeon's room in 30 seconds. '
Second day
Vandenberg Air Force Base, 8:00am
- You sure the satellite isn't radioactive?
- No.
Manchek showed me the reports.
It could be some form of space germ.
Presumably this stuff is nonporous.
Why did you pick me?
You're an MD, a talented surgeon
who knows blood chemistries.
And you're single.
- The Odd Man Hypothesis.
- What the hell is that?
Didn't you read the Wildfire material?
Very little, I never went
in much for science fiction.
Nor do I.
The Senate Committee
on Space Sciences
Closed Hearing
April 14, 1971
It seems
Dr Stone put one over on you.
He made us all think his Wildfire lab
could handle any contamination
from outer space.
I disagree with the Senator
from Vermont.
Dr Stone, a Nobel Prize winner,
twice president of the National Academy
of Sciences, is well known.
Is the implication that
Dr Stone deliberately misled us?
Perhaps not deliberately, Senator.
I'm certain that before
the Wildfire team was mobilised
Dr Stone didn't know Scoop existed.
- I'm astounded.
- National security.
Very smart. We've had experiences
with scientists before.
This famous letter Dr Stone
sent to the President two years ago.
From what you're saying,
it was just a shot in the dark?
Perhaps that's a little unfair.
Dr Stone and I were consultants
with NASA on the Lunar Receiving Lab.
He felt a more advanced lab
was required.
You mean more expensive, don't you?
I call that Dr Stone's
$90 million mash note to Uncle Sam.
"In a biological crisis which
our exploration of space could cause,
"the present Lunar Receiving Laboratory
might prove inadequate. "
University of California Faculty Club
March 20, 1969
"I therefore urge the establishment
of a facility
"to deal with
an extraterrestrial form of life.
"Its purpose would be to limit the
dissemination of a space organism
"and to provide laboratories
for its analysis.
"This facility should be located
in an uninhabited region of the US,
"it should utilise all isolation techniques
"and be equipped with a nuclear device
for self-destruction
"in the event of an emergency.
Yours very truly, Jeremy Stone. "
Don't encourage the President to think
scientists are wizards, Jeremy.
If things get out of control, and they
might, even you can't work miracles.
I'd expect to have your help, Charlie.
- Piedmont approaching.
- Go over and give us a look.
I was afraid of that.
The birds will eat the infected flesh
and then spread the disease.
If it is a disease.
- Drop the gas canisters, Dempsey.
- Someone should be alive down there?
Somebody did something,
that's for sure.
Let's give it a double dose.
That gas will only kill the birds.
OK, Dempsey, hover over the main street
and drop the ladder.
- Do not attempt to land. Is that clear?
- Roger. Clearer all the time.
When we climb down, hover at a safe
distance and come back when we signal.
If anything happens,
you have your orders.
Yes, sir. Proceed directly to Wildfire
and then, er, zzzz!
If we're eliminated,
the aircraft must be sterilised.
Wait a minute. That's not what
they told me. Just incinerated.
- Coronary?
- I doubt it.
Hall? Take a look at this.
- Are you sure that isn't coronary?
- No, coronary's painful.
- They should grimace.
- If it was fast, they wouldn't have time.
Fast? These people
were cut down in mid-stride.
Up there. Look.
An air force jet.
If we don't make it, he'll see
the helicopter does or shoot it down.
For Dempsey's sake,
we'd better not slip up.
"The day of judgment is at hand.
"Have mercy on my soul
and to hell with all the others. Amen. "
Senile.
This took time, whatever made her do it.
There's a chance someone's still alive.
I wouldn't believe
you could commit suicide that way.
Most died instantly
but a few had time to go nuts.
Let's find the damn satellite.
This injury, there isn't any bleeding.
A cut like this, torn veins,
it should bleed like hell.
Yes.
Well, there's no blood on any of them.
Even where it's chewed. No bleeding.
Hold it. Hold it!
You'd better back up,
we got to go to the... left.
We're damn close. Bear right.
I'll bet they took it to the doctor.
There it is.
The damn fool opened it.
Every country doctor should run
his office like the Lunar Lab
Capsule first, we've got about
40 minutes of oxygen left.
- Look at his buttocks.
- That's not funny.
Not meant to be. Blood in a dead person
goes to the lowest points.
There should be marks of lividity.
- See any purplish marks on his butt?
- No.
Careful you don't puncture your suit.
Clotted blood.
- Powdered.
- I'll be damned.
No wonder they didn't bleed.
It's completely clotted.
Five quarts of blood turned to powder.
In theory, a single organism could do it.
But there isn't an organism on earth...
You mean there didn't used to be.
- I don't...
- We heard it, all right.
- Go away. Go back.
- Back!
- Go back. Get out of here.
- Go back.
Get away.
- This must be the mother.
- Scared and hungry as hell.
Can't be more than six months old.
- There'll be a formula here.
- Don't feed it.
- He hasn't eaten in 12 hours.
- Wait till we get the kid out.
Maybe those who hadn't eaten
lasted longest.
Whatever it is, we can't take a chance.
Hall, wait a minute.
This is a major break - a survivor.
Too bad he can't tell us what happened.
Maybe he can... if he lives.
You...
You did it!
- Give me that knife.
- You're not human!
Everybody's dead.
What happened?
What is it?
What happened?
'The town is finished.
Contaminated beyond... '
Careful, sir - open transmission.
- I'm aware of that. Order up a 7-12.
- Only the President...
Precisely. Get on it. The town must be
neutralised immediately.
White House Situation Room
2:40pm EST
Has the President made his decision
on Directive 7-12 yet?
He doesn't jump into things.
First I've got to put together a briefing.
His main concern
is the international consequences.
What do you think, Mr Secretary?
It's against the Moscow Treaty of 1963
to fire nuclear weapons above ground.
The Russians will have to be informed
we're gonna cauterise the area.
- Then there'll be questions.
- Some we don't want answered.
That'll take hours.
God knows how far the infection
can spread in that time.
Yes, Chief?
Yes, sir.
Yes, Mr President.
The President is postponing
Directive 7-12 for 24 to 48 hours.
- But th-the...
- The National Guard will seal the area.
- That's your department, Ed.
- Safe and sound.
It should have been left up
to the scientists.
It's a colossal mistake.
Tell the President I said so.
No, but I'll get you an appointment.
'By whose decision
was the site for Wildfire chosen?'
'Dr Stone's. It seemed ideal
because of its remoteness.
'There is no inhabited area
within a 112-mile radius. '
'Las Vegas is to the north,
Phoenix is south, Los Angeles west.
'Didn't you worry
the infection might spread?'
'Yes, sir. But Dr Stone
and Dr Robertson assured the President
'Wildfire was foolproof
because of its atomic self-destruct.
'The military had to take a back seat. '
Flatrock County, Nevada
55am
They could have sent
a licensed driver to meet me.
They keep personnel to a minimum
for obvious reasons.
You're lost. No one's been down
this goat path for years.
That's how it's supposed to look.
They spent $50,000 on it.
Putting in the potholes?
Getting rid of tread marks.
Those big tractors leave an impression.
A lot of heavy equipment
has passed this way.
Where's our leader?
We'll catch up to him, and Hall, soon.
Why'd they pick Hall? He's no scientist.
Who needs an over-priced MD?
Relax and enjoy your cigarette,
it's your last.
It starts here.
It's a great place to grow pot.
Just a plain crop of barley.
Still, it is rather clever.
- Something wrong?
- I never liked red lights.
Reminds me of my years in a bordello.
- Howdy.
- Howdy Doody.
- You got the time?
- My watch stopped at 11:46.
- Durn shame.
- Must be the heat.
It's no fake.
When I retire, I'd like an
agricultural station like this - in Alaska.
- You, a sourdough?
- The sourest.
This way.
Step in.
Cute.
The whole thing,
what a world we're making.
I see why the kids are dropping out.
We should have.
It's an emergency, we got tagged. Period.
Till I saw those photos
from Vandenberg, I...
- They brought it on themselves.
- Who? The people in Piedmont?
You don't think the infection
was brought back deliberately, do you?
Skip it. I hope I'm talking through my hat.
Put your hands on that, palms down.
It's a finger and palm-print analyser...
Reads
10,000 dermatoglyphic lines.
How'd you know that?
Oh, Dutton, I have a long criminal record.
Then you're in trouble -
this machine has a long memory.
It gives you final clearance
to enter Wildfire.
'Isothermal reading
for MC Levels 4 and 5
'is ZB and RA over 2.9.'
- How's Piedmont?
- I had to order up a 7-12.
No other way to halt the spread.
- You know each other, don't you?
- By reputation.
Yes, up to now we've had
to worship from afar
Be good, Ruth.
Any messages from the White House?
Not a thing or you'd have it.
- No personal messages?
- No, ma'am.
Nothing from Dr Robertson?
Dr Stone, sir, I have one thing to do -
just one.
Everything else is computerised
and self-regulating.
I, er... I listen for a little bell in here.
"Ding-a-ling"!
That means there's a message.
- I'm expecting an MCN communication.
- Yes, sir. Top priority. "Ding-a-ling"!
I push a button and all five control
centres are notified at the same time.
- The bell hasn't rung, sir.
- Thanks for the tour, Sergeant.
Dr Dutton. Thank you.
Will you follow me, Dr Leavitt?
- May I have your glasses?
- What for?
- They'll be treated and returned to you.
- Hope so or I'll need a white cane.
Who picked Leavitt?
Talk about the Odd Man Hypothesis,
she's really an oddball.
We're lucky to have her.
She's the best replacement for Kirke.
'When dressed, proceed
directly to Conference Room 7.'
Keep this with you at all times.
- What's it for?
- You're the odd man.
The key man, quite literally.
This other key, and Wildfire itself,
depend on your key.
Wildfire has a nuclear device
for self-destruct.
In an emergency
it's activated automatically.
I've just inserted the key
to arm the mechanism.
It's ready for detonation.
- When?
- Never, we hope.
It only goes off if there's danger
of infection breaking out.
That silver key can't be removed.
Only you can disarm it
by inserting your red key
in one of the substations located
throughout the facility.
There's a five-minute delay between
detonation lock-in and explosion.
That gives you a chance to think
and, please God, call it off.
- Look, I'm the new boy here, why me?
- Because you're single.
Should have done
your homework, sport.
Page 255. Robbie's Odd Man Hypothesis.
"Results of testing confirm
the Odd Man Hypothesis -
"an unmarried male
should carry out decisions
"involving nuclear destruct contexts. "
Let me look at that.
It's vital that you always know
where your nearest substation is.
You need to be familiar
with the entire facility.
It can be studied on
this electronic diagram,
which rotates to afford an overall view.
Or it can be stopped at any section.
Detailed plans of the various levels
are also stored in the system.
We're on Level 1 of a five-storey
cylindrical underground structure.
Each level has three substations,
indicated by the yellow lights.
If the nuclear device is triggered,
you can cancel it
by inserting your red key
in a substation.
After our last simulation run,
we decided to add
two more substations per level
but they're not finished yet
so don't use them.
At the bottom of the central core
is the apparatus for self-destruct.
Each level is a different colour
based on a Navy study of the effects
of colour in environments.
Each level is biomedically cleaner
than the one above it.
We don't want to contaminate
a possible organism.
That would make it twice as hard
to isolate and characterise.
It'll take us 16 hours to descend
through the decontamination procedures
on the first four levels
to Level 5
where the main labs are.
Where exactly are we now?
There's one way to locate
yourself instantly -
call up projections
from the electronic diagram
on any video monitor
anywhere in Wildfire.
Views such as this.
This shows we're
in Conference Room 7, Level 1.
Each of us is indicated by our initial.
Our movements
are continuously monitored.
- Where are the patients?
- Where's the capsule?
The patients are the yellow Xs.
The red circle is the capsule.
On Level 5, the patients and capsule
will be biologically isolated.
Are you sure the old man and the baby
are still alive?
- What are their chances, Hall?
- Uncertain.
I'm hoping the intravenous
dextrose and saline will hold them.
We start decontamination
and immunisation procedures now.
You really expect me to fire the thing?
I'm afraid you don't understand.
All you can do is stop it.
In an emergency,
the bomb is activated automatically.
It'll go off within five minutes
unless you lock in your key.
Oh.
'Delta 5 to all levels. '
5:10pm
'We're checking ray-band emergency
communications. This is a test. '
'Proceed to infrared
radiation decontamination room 1 D.'
It could be an organism from
another planet, released deliberately.
To wipe us out? Really.
Just the opposite.
To make friendly contact.
To show us life exists elsewhere. It could
be benign in its own environment.
Pretty far-fetched.
We can't rule out anything.
'You are about to undergo
long-wave radiation.
'A buzzer will sound. Close your eyes
and stand still or blindness may result. '
We wondered how to disinfect the body,
one of the dirtiest things that exists.
- Without killing the human being.
- It gets tougher as we go.
Hard on the taxpayers,
burning up uniforms.
They're paper.
- I'd swear it was cloth.
- New process.
- Where's the next substation?
- Left of elevator on Level 2.
Right. Across from Body Analysis,
our next call.
Not for my alabaster body.
Stone, you can take
your body analyser and...
'Sit down, please.
'Please look at the screen in front of you.
'Place your body
so that all points are obliterated.
'That is fine. We may proceed.
'State your name for the records,
surname first. '
Mark Hall.
Hall, Mark.
- 'Thank you for your cooperation. '
- Yes, dear.
'Please answer the following questions
yes or no.
- 'Have you any allergies?'
- Yes. To ragweed pollen.
- I'll repeat for your memory cells...
- 'Please repeat for our memory cells. '
Ragweed pollen!
'This ends the formal questioning.
Please undress. '
'This is a scan for fungal lesions. '
'Dr Stone, this is Level 2
Control. The answer is affirmative.
'Major Manchek contacted
the White House at 11:23 this morning. '
'Contact on all leads is R for ready.
- 'Do not be nervous. '
- I'm not nervous!
'Physical parameters
are being measured.
'There's no need to be nervous,
Dr Leavitt. '
'Please raise your left arm.
'Please sit up, facing the scanning
screen, and watch carefully.
'You have received pneumatic injections
of booster immunisations.
'You may get dressed. Thank you.
This recording is now ended. '
That body analyser. I want to be there
when the AMA gets wind of it.
So far it's only been used by NASA.
You doctors better start
making house calls again!
'This is a xenon lamp apparatus.
'To ensure complete effectiveness,
spread your feet apart.
'To protect scalp and facial hair, place
the metal helmet securely on the head.
'Make sure the helmet is firmly seated
and the visor lowered,
'then raise your arms and wait. '
'You may now remove helmet.
'You will notice a fine white ash
on your body.
'This is the outer
epithelial layers of your skin
'that have been burned away.
'Please replace the helmet
'and proceed through shower
in next room.
'Then you may dress
and descend to Level 4.'
We have to rest for six hours
after exposure to the xenon lamp,
so go to your rooms and sleep.
At the end of the corridor is the cafeteria,
we'll meet there at 0400 hours tomorrow.
'Pharmacology to Maintenance LB.
'One of our RS shows six points
over nominal and pressure three. '
'Watchdog to all levels.
Scoop Vll capsule secure.
'Biocheck 66 plus 9 minus OL5.'
'Cleo Control to Keepsake 5.
'The pressure integrity check runs
2.54g/cm to the second.
'Please confirm. '
'A new form of life.
'Like Rudolph Karp's bacteria. '
Fools.
They refuse to believe
life exists in meteorites.
I showed them at the astrophysics
conference what I showed you
but no, even with a microscope
they are blind.
What do I have to do?
Hit them over the head?
I'm glad you're amused, gentlemen,
but it might just be true.
During this symposium,
we'll discuss the possibility
that intelligent life on a distant planet
may be no larger than a flea.
Perhaps no larger than a bacterium.
Third day
'Time to wake up, sir.
'Time to wake up, sir. '
Hello?
'Time to wake up, sir. '
- Who are you?
- 'Time to wake up, sir.
'Do you wish something, sir?'
- Your name.
- 'Will that be all, sir?'
For the moment.
'This is the answering service
supervisor.
'We wish you would adopt
a more serious attitude, Dr Hall. '
Sorry. Her voice is quite luscious.
'The voice belongs to
Miss Gladys Stevens who is 63 years old.
'She makes her living taping messages
for voice-reminder systems. '
Much obliged.
Let's not get sidetracked
on Rudolph Karp and his theories.
His technique was worthless.
- We should contact him.
- Fair enough. Where is he?
Behind the Iron Curtain.
He couldn't get a research grant here.
'HP nutrient now available
in the cafeteria
'for staff members from sectors 1 to 6.'
Hemlock. All for you, Hippocrates.
Not your own venom?
- Tastes like orange juice.
- Nutrient 42-5.
Developed for the astronauts. Eight
ounces satisfy all nutritional needs.
- Except coffee.
- And lipid soluble vitamins.
For that, we have these. Help yourself.
So what's the point of the cafeteria?
- Wildfire isn't always on crash status.
- Maybe there's some sugar.
- Nothing that bacteria could feed on.
- Right. No sugar in the gut.
I'd like a cigarette right now.
It's after meals you miss 'em.
You should have no trouble on Level 5,
we'll be entirely on
high-protein nutrients.
I've planned work in three stages.
One, detection.
Confirm that an organism is present.
Two, characterisation.
How's it structured, how does it work?
And three, control.
How to contain and exterminate it.
On this matter of extermination,
we should go slowly.
Without realising, we might destroy
an intelligent form of life.
Let's go, I have two patients down there.
- The team has two subjects.
- They're not guinea pigs, Stone.
'You may now proceed to Level 5,
gentlemen. '
Erm... stop by your rooms and insert
these before taking the elevator.
I have risked drowning in that bath,
I have been parboiled, irradiated
and xenon-flashed and now...
We haven't done anything
about the GI tract yet.
On Level 5 we must be
as germ-free as possible.
Anyone care to join me for a smoke?
- Level 5, 4:33am
- 'Watchdog to Level 2, Sector D.
'You are Red Kappa Phoenix status. '
Off the main corridor,
on the outer rim,
are the living quarters,
conference room, cafeteria,
biosafety maintenance, etc.
Inside are the labs.
- Where's the library?
- No need for books.
Everything's in the computer.
Notice the capsule's already been
delivered by the sterile conveyor system
to the main control lab here.
Your patients are in
the Hot Room of Miscellaneous.
We can't have any
direct contact with them.
'Dr Dutton and Dr Hall
are wanted in Main Control immediately. '
Hey!
If the patients are sealed off,
how do I get to them?
- Ever used a glove box?
- No.
Wildfire's gone further - whole rooms
that operate like glove boxes.
You'll be working in one shortly.
'We have a magnetic K indices here,
give us a code three when you get it. '
I wanted you here while we see if there's
still anything biologically active.

is still there and potent.
If potent's the word. Let's try a rhesus.
We'll want a postmortem on it, anyway.
'Housekeeping to Level 5.
Clean sweep schedule B now in effect.
'Germ-free animal technicians

So, OK. Isolate and identify.
Right. You and I'll scan the capsule.
Charlie, you work on these in autopsy.
Open the SL, Ruth.
'Adjust SY system

'Points 2A and 5, points 9 through 12

- Charlie?
- Yes.
Yes, the vector study first, then autopsy.
Incredible.
Dutton.
Be careful. Let our distinguished
surgeon handle the knife.
Fine, but not for a while.
First I'm a paediatrician and a geriatrist.
Take it easy.
Charlie will have a technician.
What's been done for them?
Plasma for the old man,
dextrose for the baby.
- Your therapy?
- No.
- Medcom's.
- Do I call you Miss Medcom?
If you like, Dr Hall.
My name's Karen Anson.
Good. I couldn't cope
with two machines. How does this work?
We're lucky. Medcom's got
one of the best minds here.
It's a medical data analyser
that can diagnose as well as prescribe.
It's hooked up to the main computer.
Every instrument in Wildfire is plugged
into it on a time-sharing basis.
All our lab studies are done
on machines.
- I prefer the personal touch.
- It's hard to come by in those suits.
- Have you worked in them?
- Not for real.
- But I've been drilling for three months.
- Thank God. It's new to me.
It's new to all of us.
Until now, Wildfire's been like a game.
We've even had
simulation biowar games,
with live subjects - volunteers.
I mean, I'm scared.
- I never believed it could really happen.
- It has happened.
I'll need some lab tests.
Use this to check off what you want.
- Just touch the pen to the screen.
- Hm.
You draw the bloods,
I'll do the physicals.
Use the bar. The tunnel seals off
automatically behind you.
The only way you might break your suit
is with a scalpel
and a surgeon isn't likely to do that.
'Biosafety to SL.

Second scan completed.
Score, nothing to nothing.
Go to 100 power.
No, Ruth, use one microscanner.
Are you being paid hourly?
We could do it in half the time.
Less chance of missing something
with one screen.
Go to the inside. They put the scoop on
to scoop something into it.
They got what they were looking for.
We're not here to make accusations,
we have a job to do purely as scientists.
Maybe not so pure.
Continue the scan, Ruth. On the outside.
No, don't do that. We'll use the hands.
Nothing can happen. I'm faster.
I want you out of the Hot Room.
'BZ Doris to IZ Alice,
SDT energy output is 1.8 to 3.0 joules
'which rates 2 to 3 milliradians.
'And we still need those blankets. '
No sweat. Those cages are airtight.
I wish you would sweat
a little more, Toby.
Sweat is a safeguard against
carelessness. Use the hands.
- Wow.
- Transmitted by air, as we thought.
Now we've got to determine its size.
Could be a gas or a virus.
We'll use a 100 angstrom filter to begin.
About the size of a small virus.
All systems go, sir.
Whatever it is, it's larger than a virus.
- We'll try a one-micron filter.
- Hang in there, baby.
Must be pretty big,
I'm gonna get a flyswatter.
Do that. Here goes with two microns.
Aha. Nasty.
At least we'll be able
to get a good look at it. Dutton to Stone.
'We've just found out its size -
about two microns. '
Big enough to be a complete cell.
Interesting.
There's a good chance it's alive.
Airborne transmission?
- 'Yes. What have you found?'
- So far, nothing.
Our Nobel laureate
won't scan the inside...
All right. Thanks, Charlie. Keep at it.
It's pointless to go on scanning outside.
If it's two microns,
we'd have seen it at 440.
True. But we didn't know that before.
We'll start with five power inside.
Stick to established procedure.
Establishment gonna fall down
and go boom!
Switch to manual. The interior's
too irregular to probe on automatic.
More light, huh?
Here's his blood value now.
Half normal. Severely anaemic.

- J-Jackson.
- What?
Jackson.

- 'It's clear you're a bachelor. '
- What?
I didn't say anything.
'We're doing an isotope scan -
how the bugs get in. You should watch. '
I assume it was inhaled. It's not likely
it's absorbed through the skin.
'That's what we'll find out now -
the mechanism of death. '
'We'll look at a replay
of that at speed six.
'That tells us what
we want to know, Hall.
'The organism is inhaled.
The clotting spreads from the lungs. '
I didn't think it possible for the total
volume of blood to solidify that fast.
I hoped one clot may form in the brain
which made them go insane,
then the rest clotted more slowly -
we could cure that.
'Cure what? We don't know what it is.
'Stone and Leavitt haven't been able
to isolate the hellish thing.
'Of course, they will in time. '
Of course.
9:50am
Hold it.
At the edge of that shadow.
I think there's...
Me too.
It's an indentation.
Yes.
About the size of a pencil point.
Go to 40.
Go to 60.
Do you think maybe...
Maybe it's just a grain of sand.
Go to 80.
What about the bits of green?
Paint.
Pistachio ice cream!
Don't assume anything!
You're too good a scientist
not to be thinking the same thing I am.
If this is really something new,
some brand-new form of life...
Our best hope is to be grindingly
thorough, using computer number one.
OK? Now, let's get on with it.
Hold it.
More pistachio?
I count four patches.
Keep going.
I'll computerise the coordinates.
Let's take a look at the rock at 100.
I doubt that knocked it off
trajectory.
Unless the rock was going at
tremendous speed or is very heavy.
It can't be that heavy,
Hall and I could lift the capsule.
But it's possible the rock
is different in space.
Maybe it has elastic properties
we don't even know yet.
Let's have a look at the green patches.
They must have come off the rock.
If it is rock.
You know something?
They do look like spatters of paint.
Let's see the rock again at 440.
If that's a meteor,
it's a damn peculiar one.
This left border, over here.
It's smooth.
Almost like an artificial surface.
Painted, maybe? Luminous paint?
If I keep watching it, I might think so.
"Wet paint" sign and all.
- Jeremy?
- What?
Nothing.
You OK?
My eyes are tired.
We've been at it for five hours.
We'll take a caffeine break soon.
First, I want to see
one of the patches of green at 1,000.
Did you see that?
Yes.
- You didn't change the lighting?
- I didn't touch it.
It's alive.
Yes.
Bigger than two microns.
Which means the infection is spread
by a mere fraction of the green.
I'm bringing down cameras.
Let's have the other microscanner.
- Stone to Level Control, I need a Mic T.
- 'Roger. Will send. '
- Jump it up to 1,500.
- It doesn't go any higher.
We can get 1,500 in Microchemistry.
I'll send the rock through.
'Attention CLTs on Levels 4 and 5.
'Main computer shows

'at ten to the twelfth digit.
'For any change

'CLTs must check their unicom off. '
Beautiful, sir. I'm the Mic T.
You're real sharp on the hands.
Nice to know I've not lost my touch.
Next step is to see what makes it grow.
We'll need samples
to send through Maxcult.
Roger, sir. In work.
Good God!
It's growing.
Not so good.
He has acidosis.
His blood pH is nine points off normal.
But why? Stupid machine!
What makes his blood too acid?
Ask the patient.
'Biosafety to SL, sector 3-6.
'Give us a code three when you get it. '
Mr Jackson.
Now, don't be scared. I'm a doctor.
Bull.
- Where am I?
- A special laboratory in Nevada.
We brought you here from Piedmont.
You're sick.
It's this damn stomach of mine.
- Bleeding?
- Hell, yes, bleeding.
In your stomach? You have an ulcer?
Damn tootin'.
Two years.
You must have pain.
What do you do for it?
Aspirin...
and squeeze.
Squeeze? What's that?
Ain't gonna tell you.
So you're a Sterno drinker, huh?
Works good.
Give him squeeze.
What's the baby's name, Mr Jackson?
- You the nurse?
- Uh-huh.
Shoot! Can't see your legs.
Do you know the baby's name?
- Give us a butt first.
- Smoking isn't allowed here.
Then go fish.
We'll transfuse Jackson
and start ice-water lavage.
He has a history of bleeding ulcers.
- You seem delighted.
- It may be the reason he survived.
If only our young gourmet
weren't so normal.
Let's hope nothing changes that.
We might have to before this is over.
They should have dropped
the bomb two days ago.
10:15am
This Phantom crashed 60 miles
beyond the cordoned area.
We can't cordon off airspace.
I just don't understand why Wildfire
hasn't beefed about the delay in 7-12.
Almost 24 hours and not a word.
I don't think Piedmont had anything
to do with this crash. It was a fluke.
That plane was only over the WF area
for two minutes, at 23,000 feet.
It's a training mission accident, I bet.
Pilot error.
Let's go.
Check with Wildfire Message Centre.
Make sure everything's nominal.
Send me word on the scrambler
at Big Head crash base.

'Dr Robertson, you're saying
Stone's $90 million facility,

'Tell that to the taxpayers. '
'These were highly trained
men looking for an electronic fault.
'The trouble was mechanical,
of the simplest kind,
'but for them, it was like trying to see
an elephant through a microscope.
'The sliver had wedged between
the bell and striker,
'preventing the bell from ringing. '
12:00 noon
I'm convinced
we're being held incommunicado.
Very flattering. We don't know
much more than when we got here.
We know about Scoop now. It's possible
what Scoop found was no accident.
I suspect they were looking for
the ultimate biological weapon.
Sounds like you're getting paranoid
in this funhouse.
What does Stone think?
About the ultimate weapon, I mean.
We've isolated the organism.
It's in Microchemistry.
We'll show you.

'IB Control to cafeteria, Level 3.

Ready.
Nothing so unusual
about our rock after all.
Hydrogen, carbon,
oxygen, sulphur, silicon, etc.
Except the black rock isn't rock at all.
It's some material similar to plastic.
How about that?
The green's even simpler.
Hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
The four basic elements of life on earth,
nothing else. That's a relief.
I'd have been happier
if it hadn't been alive.
Green stuff,
you really had us going for a while.
AA analysis results are ready.
Something's wrong.
It's not registering.
Yes, it is, sir. It's just registering
double zero, double zero.
We'll switch to computerised analysis.
No amino acids!
No proteins, no enzymes,
no nucleic acid.
Impossible. No organism
can maintain life without them.
You mean no earth organism. It must
have evolved in a totally different way.
You got it.
It doesn't come from here.
Without chemical reactions there can't
be life. Yet it grows, reproduces...
Wait. The infection has been stopped
by the bomb.
We're secure. We have everything
we need to achieve a breakthrough.
We just attack this problem
like any other.
You could spend years
solving its structure.
But when you do,
there'll be some red faces.
It could change everything.
Great.
Ruth, take over the growth programme.
We're halfway home if we find out
what will keep that from growing.
- Charlie, work with me on the EM.
- OK.
- Hall...
- Let me get back to my patients.
I'm sure they were protected
by some simple mechanism I don't see.
There's got to be something that the
old man and the baby have in common.
Oh, Hall?
- Five minutes.
- You told me before.
We wouldn't want you
to get too far from a substation now.
- 4:30pm
- Men, look out for pieces of rubber.
I'll repeat that, keep a sharp eye open
for pieces of rubber.
Major. Major Manchek.
Take a look at that, sir.
We just found this, General.
It's a human bone.
Arm, I think.
It looks picked clean,
like it was polished.
- That's right.
- I don't get it.
There is no actual rubber
on the Phantom F-4.
It's all a synthetic plastic compound
called Polycron.
It has some of the characteristics
of human skin.
- What's that?
- What's left of his oxygen mask.
It's made of Polycron.
I'd say it was done
by a chemical reaction
- or maybe a microorganism.
- Meaning?
There was something in that plane
that consumes plastic.
45pm
'How's Maxcult coming? Will you be
finished by the midnight conference?'
- Easy.
- 'Good.
'You can give us the results then. '

- Yep.
- You always have to wear that iron suit?
- Yep.
Maybe you'll tell us
the baby's name now?
Manuel Rios. Mex.

Squalls morning, noon and night.
Neighbours wouldn't let 'em
keep their windows open.
- Do you sleep with your window closed?
- No, sirree, Bob.
Fresh air fiend.
Tell us what happened.
I don't want to think about it.
You know what people will say?
Piedmont was bad,
that's why it was punished.
First the town went crazy
and then was destroyed.
You're crazy.
Folks at Piedmont was good.
Decent, normal folks.
The man we found in his
doughboy's uniform, that's normal?
Pete Arnold, who worked at the store.
- It was the disease.
- How do you know?
Cos the only thing wrong with him
before that night was sugar.
Diabetes? Did he take insulin?
Couple of times a day.
Hated the needle.
I tried to talk him into using squeeze.
Insulin. If he missed his treatment,
he'd go...
Thanks, Mr Jackson.
Oh, my God.
'Central CC to Big PC Control,

'Doctor, you have a midnight

I heard!
I heard. I've been busy.
Fourth day
The important thing is
that something can slow it down.
I think it's some kind of blood disorder.
If the old soldier missed his insulin,
he'd go into acidosis
the same as Jackson on Sterno.
I'll bet Leavitt finds no growth
on some of the blood cultures.
What's wrong with the baby's blood?
Nothing. So far.
- Then you're back where you started?
- No, they're all inter-related.
I'll have the answer when I know why
a 69-year-old Sterno drinker with an ulcer
is like a normal six-month-old baby.
- Get any no-growth read-outs?
- No, but I'm not finished.
- You said you would be by now.
- I decided to play it back.
- The first time should be enough...
- Knock it off!
Wait. Wait.
We're all tired.
Tired people make mistakes.
They draw wrong conclusions,
they drop things.
That mustn't happen.

- They didn't drop the bomb!
- It was sent yesterday.
Idiots!
- Put me through to Dr Robertson.
- 'In work, sir. '
- You didn't special alert a message.
- 'There were none, sir. The bell... '
Don't argue, dammit!
I got one in my hand.
'Well, well.
About time we heard from you. '
A communications foul-up.
Why the hell wasn't that bomb dropped?
'The decision on 7-12 isn't final.
It was just postponed 48 hours. '
By then it could be
a worldwide epidemic.
'Rash statements are why
the President doesn't trust scientists. '
Warn the President it may be too late!
You've got to make him call a 7-12.
'Can I get an appointment tonight?'
'Now, let's all just keep
our heads screwed on.
'Any thoughts about the Phantom crash?
'We sent you a couple
of messages on it. '
- 'A Phantom jet strayed over Piedmont. '
- Any other information?
'The pilot said rubber was dissolving.
His last communication was weird. '
- Like he was crazy?
- He was mighty confused.
Robbie, it's your job to get the President
to activate a 7-12.
Or else anyone west of Piedmont
might not live!
'Simmer down.
I'll wake the boss.
'General Sparks
says the crash was a fluke. '
Forget the crash, Robbie.
Stay on that 7-12.
We'll be working round the clock.
2:45am
That's a good slice. But too thick.
I'm setting it at 800 angstroms
and I'm going to a higher magnification.
Now we're getting somewhere.
But these can't be
more than a few molecules in depth.
That's the one. That silver one.
'This is a Villabach alert. A levels.
'Electromagnetic waves
are not registering on the DIRs. '
Sample in the button and sealed.
Start the vacuum pump.
'Stone, I have the results
of the growth cultures. '
We can't leave now.
We have an Andromeda cell on the EM.
Charlie, let's put it on the screen.
Run it through the computer
for contrast expansion.
- Stone?
- What do you think?
Looks like a crystal.
- Gentlemen, there's our answer.
- To what?
- How it functions without amino acids.
- Crystalline structure?
Yes. I've often thought that living matter
might be based on crystals.
All these wedge-shaped compartments
would separate biochemical functions.
It's dividing.
In a vacuum? Bombarded by electrons?
It shouldn't be alive!
That's what I wanted to tell you.
Andromeda can live on anything.
Only gas and light affect it.
- You didn't get any no-growth results?
- None. Look.
The poorest growth occurs in pure
oxygen incubated under infrared light.
Andromeda grows best in carbon dioxide
and hydrogen under X-rays.
- No excretions, no waste of any kind.
- You'd expect that.
Andromeda's perfect
for existence in outer space.
Consumes everything. Wastes nothing.
- Good Lord!
- What?
- Get me Robertson now!
- I hope we're not too late.
- Tell me.
- It functions like an atomic reactor.
An atomic blast could give it enough
energy to grow into a supercolony.
In one day.
'You can relax now.
We've just left the
President, he agreed... '
No, stop 7-12 from happening.
'We're not playing Ping-Pong.
We just finished telling the President... '
Go back! It grows when exposed
to X-rays or any source of energy.
No nuclear device
must be detonated near it.
Andromeda works like a reactor.
Converts matter to energy directly.
'The bomb would only provide
a fantastically rich growth medium.
- 'Understand?'
- 'No, but I'll make the recommendation.
'He'll be pleased he made
the right decision in the first place. '
Congratulate him
on his scientific insight.
And Robbie, you'd better get
the self-destruct in here disarmed.
'Right. I'll start on the clearances now.
It'll be done by morning. '
No, no, no. That won't work
until the damn thing's going.
3:50am
All the molecules
appear to be the same.
Andromeda isn't composed of
different substances like a normal cell.
All the subunits are the same.
It's the damnedest thing I've ever...
A single substance.
Then how does anything
so simple utilise energy for growth?
- Can't tell from that structure.
- Yes, we can.
We can get a computerised version
of how it functions.
They're not uniform. Could be mutations.
What the devil?
601?
The computer's overloaded.
Too much data coming in too fast.
Dividing and mutating at the same time?
And nothing to stop it.
Normal earth checks and balances
don't exist for it.
We'd better get a biomath mapping
of its new growth potential.
According to this, there'll be
a supercolony over the southwest...
Jeremy, these are
biological warfare maps.
Why, yes, so they are.
Well, but... simulations, Charlie.
Defensive. It's just a scenario.
That's not the point, for God's sake.
Wildfire was built for germ warfare!
Wildfire and Scoop
and you knew, Stone. You knew it!
Not true. I learned about Scoop
when you did.
They already had
Andromeda programmed.
Scoop was built to find new biological
weapons in space - to develop here!
- It stinks, Stone.
- We have no proof.
- The map!
- Don't be an ass!
That's only what it could do
in the hands of an enemy.
Enemy? We did it to ourselves.
Perhaps. But it's hardly the time
to organise a protest.
Another giant leap for mankind.
I wish I could believe you.
The only important thing now
is to find the antidote.
Let's get on with it.
Test the culture organisms
for biologic potency.
All right. I'll run them
against a rat in Autopsy.
- I'll seal off the capsule.
- Watch it. Andromeda's altered.
Its effect might be radically different.
I'll try to get a photo of the mutated form.
4:30am
'Photo Lab to Red Lab.
'Optimum axis reference

- She's in trouble.
- Ruth, are you...?

- No, it's epilepsy.
Give her the injection. She'll be all right.
Good girI. Thanks.
'I'm scared. Oh, Lord, I'm scared. '
You'll be OK. We're pumping pure
oxygen in, Andromeda doesn't like it.
- He's alive.
- Where have you been?
- Leavitt had a seizure.
- What?
Epilepsy.
A red light flashing brought on a fit.
- Why didn't she tell us?
- No lab would have her if they knew.
- Insurance, prejudice, all that crap.
- From the Middle Ages.
- Amazing he's still alive.
- It's been three minutes.
He's on pure oxygen.
I don't know how long that can hold him.
We're, erm, working
on some ideas, Charlie.
'Ask your germ warfare friends.
They have lots. '
Try to stay calm.
- What happened?
- The seal must have broken.
Had the same thing at the Lunar Lab.
That's why we use Polycron
gaskets here.
At least the rest of Wildfire is secure.
Poor devil.
Look at the way he's breathing.
He's scared.
That oxygen should relax him,
slow down his breathing.
No, we want him to breathe fast.
Jackson was on Sterno. Sterno, acidosis.
Acidosis, rapid breathing.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Turn off the oxygen.
- The baby?
- Cries, can't catch his breath.
- Rapid breathing? It can't be that simple.
- It isn't. Dutton?
Don't let the bug in your lungs
long enough to penetrate blood vessels.
I'll turn off the pure oxygen -
you breathe room air as fast as you can.
'No! No, I was running a test in here.
The air is thick with Andromeda.
- 'Experiment with your own life!'
- We won't do it.
- I'm sure it has to do with breathing.
- 'Dr Hall?
'May I please feed the baby?
He's been crying ever since... '
That's what I want. Keep him crying
and run another blood value on him.
'Yes, Doctor. '
With all the yelling the kid
should have too little acid - alkalotic.
A condition opposite to the old man -
too much alkali.
What good does that do Dutton?
- Karen, where's the blood test?
- 'It's coming through now. '
'Hell of a way to run a hospital. '
Just what you expected.
Opposite blood chemistries.
- One of them should be a dead opposite.
- But he's not.
There must be a connection.
They both stayed alive in Piedmont,
one's blood too alkaline
the other too acid...
Yes. Yes!
Dutton, I'm turning off the oxygen.
Breathe fast.
'No, don't let him cut off my oxygen. '
- No! The air in that room is loaded.
- Air doesn't matter. Blood does.
That's the answer.
I need 30 seconds
to run a growth programme.
He could die in 30 seconds.
- Leavitt checked all the programmes.
- Epileptics blank out.
I want to see how Andromeda's growth
is affected by blood of pH... Damn.
You do it.
Excellent.
The graph's straight up and down.
Andromeda can only exist
within a narrow range of pH.
A very narrow range. On either side
of the range - no growth, nothing.
It's exterminated.
Dutton, our troubles are over.
It grows within a narrow range of pH.
- A very narrow range.
- If your blood's abnormal,
if it's too acid or alkaline,
Andromeda can't survive.
So breathe as fast as you can.
Go into respiratory alkalosis.
Fine. That'll shoot
your blood chemistry to hell.
It's what happens to the baby
when he cries or the old man.
- How do you feel?
- 'OK.
'Er, a little dizzy but OK.'
He can't keep breathing like that,
he'll pass out.
- We need to alkalise his blood.
- We can't in there.
Charlie? That cage - in the Hot Room.
Right in front of you.
It's alive.
'The rat's been exposed
as long as I have - longer.
'I exposed it to the cultures first. '
Precisely. Andromeda's mutated
to a non-infectious form.
Holy...
- Where does that gasket lead?
- Central core. Connects all the labs.
The gaskets are decomposing.
It's Andromeda!
Next sector. There's no substation here.
'Level 5 is sealed.
Emergency procedures are in effect. '
When the bomb goes off,
there'll be 1,000 mutations.
Andromeda will spread everywhere.
'There are now five minutes
to self-destruct. '
- What about the other levels?
- Can't tell. Each sector seals off.
The defence system is perfect.
It'll even bury our mistakes.
What about the central core?
- The core has safeguards.
- What?
Gas, lasers,
to prevent lab animal escape.
- What are my chances in there?
- They don't exist here.
- How do I get into the core?
- Through there.
Go. I'll ride shotgun for you
in Main Control and monitor the lasers.
Karen, get me a scalpel.
'There are now four minutes
and 30 seconds to self-destruct. '
Cut it off! Cut the panel off.
Karen, cut it!
Come on, hurry up!
Hey, Doc!
You ain't leaving us here, are you?
The lasers are tuned low
for small animals.
'You can make it
if you're not hit on the spinal cord. '
'There are now four minutes
to self-destruct. '
'That's the ladder.
Go before the gas starts. '
'There are now three
minutes and 30 seconds to self-destruct. '
'That's the gas. Keep going. '
The sensors have picked you up.
Get moving.
'Duck. '
'Keep going.
'Duck.
'Keep going.
'Duck!'
'There are
now three minutes to self-destruct. '
It's no good.
The level's contaminated, go to 3.
'Go to 3!'
'There are now two minutes
and 45 seconds to self-destruct. '
Sway. Weave.
You're zeroed in. Duck.
'There are now two minutes
and 30 seconds to self-destruct. '
'Keep going. You'll make it!'
'There are now two minutes
and 15 seconds to self-destruct. '
'Fight the effect,
it's mostly shock. '
You can still do it. See the door?
'There are now two minutes
to self-destruct.
'There is now one minute
and 45 seconds to self-destruct.
'There is now one minute
and 30 seconds to self-destruct. '
- 'There is now one minute... '
- You're in an airlock. Turn the wheel.
No, not that one! The one near the door!
'There are now 60 seconds
to self-destruct.
'There are now 55 seconds
to self-destruct.
'There are now 50 seconds
to self-destruct. '
Where is it?
Come on, where is it?
Help me!
'There are now 40 seconds
to self-destruct.
'There are now 35 seconds
to self-destruct.
'There are now 30 seconds
to self-destruct.
'There are now 25 seconds
to self-destruct.
'20 seconds, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15,
'14, 13, 12, 11,
'10, nine...
'Self-destruct has been cancelled. '
Congratulations.
- I take it the bomb didn't...
- No, it didn't.
Eight seconds to spare.
Hardly even exciting.
What's happening?
The supercolony is now off the coast
moving across the Pacific.
Andromeda hasn't turned lethal again -
no reports of bizarre deaths.
We're applying your antidote to it -
cloud seeding.
We're seeding the clouds
with silver iodide.
The rain will carry the organism
into the ocean
and the alkaline reaction should kill it.
Just as acids or alkali
in the blood stopped it.
'This cloud seeding, Stone,
are you sure it worked? You better be. '
'All reports indicate success. '
'Then your
so-called biological crisis is over. '
'As far as Andromeda goes, yes.
We continue to study it.
'We now know that other forms of life
exist in the universe. '
- Thanks to Scoop.
- Yes.
However, with this new knowledge
there's no guarantee that another
so-called biological crisis won't occur.
Hm.
What do we do about that?
Precisely, Senator.
What do we do?
