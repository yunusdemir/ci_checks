He sent me flowers... to wish me luck.

Fundamental differences, I guess.
It wasn't going to last.

Oh. Really great, actually.

I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp and... and relevant.
And I... I think
he's really got something.
- You think?
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll check it out.
- Great.
Have fun tonight, Ana.

Can we talk somewhere... private?
No.
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...
I've never wanted to try again.
Christian, I don't...
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.
Okay? Just talk. Please.

I have a proposition.
Just...
...come to dinner, we can talk.
Would you like some more time?
No. Two steaks... medium fries...
...green vegetables.
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.
Fine. And two glasses
of the Barossa Valley Shiraz.
We only sell that by the bottle, sir.
A bottle, then.
Yes, sir.
Thanks.
So...
...let's talk.
I want you back.
I'd like to renegotiate terms.
But I don't see how.
The things you want, you said
that's the way you are.
But what happened last time,
it's not gonna happen again.
How can you say that?
I know that I asked you to...
...show me how far it can go, but...
...you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.
That's still in you.
I'm working on it.
Working on what?
I can't do this if you won't talk to me.
What do you want to know?
Everything.
Fine.
Yeah. We'll manage.
My birth mother died when I was four.
She was an addict. Crack.
You can fill in the blanks.
Why didn't you tell me that?
I did.
But you were asleep at the time.
Okay. Well, um...
...generally...
...a key part of good communication...
...is that both parties be conscious.
I'm really sorry about your mother.
It's in the past.
Now...
I brought you here to negotiate.
You're open to new terms?
No rules.
No punishments.
No rules, no punishments, and...
...no more secrets.
I can do that.
You want a...
What do you call it...?
A vanilla relationship?
I mean we only do
what you're comfortable with.
But you need all those things.
I need you more.
Miss Steele.
Thanks, Taylor.
No strings attached.
This is spiky.
I like it.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay.
Good night.
Hmm.
Ana.
I've been hearing a lot of
good things about you.
- Oh...
- <i>Told you, Liz.</i>
This one actually reads.
- Hey, Jack.
- What's the head of HR doing...
...lurking around?
Are we in trouble?
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.
<i>Really? Well, I think...</i>
...a round of drinks at Lori's
would do the trick.
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.
Who's Lori?
Oh, it's a bar around the corner.
- Oh.
- Fridays are a bit of a ritual.
You should come.
Absolutely. Go network.
Oh, no, I... I would.
I... have plans tonight.
So, have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Jack.</i>
Yeah. Yeah...
...no, my, uh, my...
Have fun.
<i>Doing light duty, I swear.</i>
Yeah. Two more chapters
like that and we're good.
Anastasia.
I'm sorry, have we met before?
It's okay.
I'm nobody.
Hey. Lori's is this way.
Come on. I'm buying.
All right, here we go.
Thanks.
- Where is everyone?
- You know, it's still early.
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.
Yeah, well, I think the parallels...
...with Dante's Inferno are amazing...
- ...but...
- No, no, no. You convinced me.
I'm reading.
<i>Oh. That's great.</i>
Hey.
Hi. Um, uh, Christian...
...this is Jack Hyde.
I'm the boyfriend.
I'm the boss.
What'll you have, Chris?
Thanks, Jack.
Another time.
Mm.
Thanks.
Another time.
I can't believe...
...you just talked to him like that.
He wants what's mine.
What's yours?
That's a little presumptuous.
He's my boss, Christian.
You've got to calm down.
Calm isn't really my forte.
I know something that could help.
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.
When's the last time you went shopping?
Houston. A week ago.
What'd you buy?
An airline.

Morale? You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle...
...and sing the company song
in the morning?
Yeah, is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?
- Oh, my God.
- What?
You're buying SIP?
No, you can't do that.
That's my job.
You can't start interfering
in my career.
It's not about that.
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They're the best fit.
But you're gonna be my boss.
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.
And I'm gonna be sleeping

Well, right now you're arguing with him.
Yeah, because he's being an ass.

Why do you think you waited?
For sex.
Um...
Well...
I was reading Austen and... Brontë...
...and nobody ever measured up to that.
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.
And then I met you.
Would Miss Austen...
...approve of this?
I was being romantic, and then
you just go and distract me...
...with your kinky fuckery.
- "Kinky fuckery"?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't know what that is.
But I like the sound of it.
You looked so peaceful,
I didn't want to wake you.
There's not much for breakfast...
...unless you want cold stir-fry.
No.
Here. The check
you gave me for Wanda...
- ...you should have it back.
- Keep it.
Keep it? It's $24,000.
Ana.
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.
- <i>Yes, Mr. Grey.</i>
- Andrea, good morning.
Could you please transfer $24,000...
...into the account
of Miss Anastasia Steele?
No. What are you doing?
That's fine. Thank you.
<i>You're welcome.</i>
Why do you have my bank account details?
What's good for breakfast around here?
Christian, how do you have
my bank information?
Thank you.
Got to be quicker than that, Grey.
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.
I promised I'd make an appearance.
Want you to come with me.
<i>- The food is really good.
- Oh, yeah, really good.</i>
I've never been to a ball.
I don't have...
I don't have a dress for that.
Also, uh, what am I
gonna do with my hair?
I know a salon.
And you don't need
to worry about a dress.
It's all gonna be taken care of it.
- What is it?
- Um...
There was just a girl over there...
...and she was outside
my office yesterday.
And she knew my name.
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.
We should go.
Just now.
Yeah.
Keep me informed.
You know that girl, Christian?
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?
Don't want you to worry about it.
Trust me.
<i>Yes, when were you
thinking of coming in?</i>
One moment, let me put you on hold.
Um...
<i>Hey. How you doing?</i>
Good. Okay.
So, uh, my girlfriend's here...
- Done.
- Okay, fine.
Oh.
- Hey, how are you doing? Good.
- Christian, I missed you.
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Ana.
Is that Mrs. Robinson?
Her name's Elena Lincoln.
I don't care
what her name is, Christian.
Why would you take me there?
Why would you take me to meet
the woman who seduced...
- ...and abused you?
- Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.
And business partners.
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?
Would you take your subs there?
Oh, my God.
For what, her approval?
- What?
- What is this?
No, it's... it's not like that.
That girl that I saw this morning...
...was one of them, wasn't she?
Let's discuss this back at my place.
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.
Christian, I don't care about my hair.
Explain to me what's going on.
I'll explain when we're there.
Come on.
Okay, you can either walk,
or I can carry you.
- Your choice.
- You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.
Okay, fine. Fine. I'll walk.
<i>Her name's Leila Williams.</i>
She was my sub for a while
about two years ago.
What happened to her?
She wanted more; I didn't.
So I ended it.
She... left, got married.
I thought she moved on,
but then her husband died...
...in a car crash.
She had a breakdown.
What does she want now?
When you and I were
in Georgia together...
...she turned up here
and tried to slit her wrists...
...in front of Mrs. Jones,
my housekeeper.
Oh, my God.
Gail took her to the hospital.
But by the time I got there,
she'd taken off.
My people have been trying to find her.
Your people?
Is that who put this together?
Is there one on me?
Let me see it.
"Subject works part-time
at Clayton's Hardware...
...Richmond Road."
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.
You should probably get your money back.
I had them drawn up...
...on any prospective submissive.
Ha! Nice. Jesus.
You know, I had no idea what this...
...was gonna become...
I didn't know you'd be different.
Different?
Really?
Is that why you brought
me to Mrs. Robinson's...
...where you brought
all the other women?
Because I'm so different?
That was wrong, I admit.
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.
You put money into my account
that... I... I don't want it.
You bought the company I work for.
This isn't a relationship,
Christian, it's ownership.
I'm trying to understand you.
I am...
...just wanting to get close to you.
But it's really difficult to do that...
...when you keep doing
bizarre things like this.
And it's really difficult to do that...
...when you won't let me touch you.
Come to my bedroom.
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?
Ana...
Please.
You wanted a road map?
Start here.
Those are my boundaries.
I can live with that.
Then I'm all yours.
<i>Mr. Grey...</i>
<i>...your appointment's arrived.</i>
Okay, send him into Ana's room.

I can give you this...
Christian has a date.
I'm impressed.
I'm sorry?
Elena.
I wanted to meet you.
I can't say the same.
Excuse me.
Hey, I'm not the enemy.
I know what you did to Christian.
All I did was lead him to
the truth of who he really is.
Without me, he'd be in jail or dead.
And he would say the same.
I'm not listening to this.
Do you think you're the first woman...
...he'd hoped would save him?
He needs a submissive in life.
Not just in the bedroom.
No. He's changing that.
It's not what he wants anymore.
But it's what he needs.
And you don't strike me
as the type of woman...
...who wants to be owned.
If you really want to make him happy...
...if you want to be happy...
...you'll let him go.
There's no way that someone like you...
...could ever understand what we have.
I've been there.
Nothing lasts.
Nothing.
Whatever happens
between me and Christian...
...is none of your goddamn business.
So you stay the fuck away from us.
<i>Hey.</i>
We should think about going soon.
I want to go now.
What did Elena say to you?
Nothing I didn't already know.
Will you just take me to my house?
Stay with me tonight.
Hey, wake up. We're home.
Sir.
Stay here.
<i>No.</i>
Yeah, her car is totally trashed.
They're fine.
They're okay.
Well, I think we're gonna...
...head over there now.
- We'll have the car towed.
- <i>What happened?</i>
That's my car.
What happened to my car?
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.
Yes, sir. Right away.
Smith, you stick with Mr. Grey.
- Stay with Mr. Grey.
- Where are we going?
Christian?
<i>Do you think it was Leila?</i>
You really think she would do
something like that?
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.
That place is like a fortress.
There's no way she
could have gotten in there.
She shouldn't have been able
to get into the garage, either.
I'm not taking any chances.
Good evening, Mr. Grey.
Hey, Ed.
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.
If something were to happen
to you because of me...
It won't.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.
Can I wash this off?
Don't stray from the lines.
Okay.
<i>Are these burns?</i>
Who did this to you?
Go on, it's over.
I know how difficult it is for you to...
...open up to me...
...and...
...tell me these things.
But it means the world to me.
It means you love me.
Yes.
I do.
Mm.
So this is where...
...your knot-tying expertise comes from.
Good morning.
You sleep well?
I did.
This boat is really beautiful.
This is from my yard in Seattle.
You built it?
I had some help.
It's called The Grace.
After your mom?
You sound surprised.
Well, you're always so cool
towards her, and...
I owe everything to Grace.
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.
Do you remember your birth mom?
I try not to.
What happened to her?
She overdosed.
They found her body three days later.
Where were you?
I was with her.
Oh, my God.
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.
Grace was there.
Thank you for telling me.
Look at that house.
That's beautiful.
The view's probably amazing.
I wonder who lives there.
It's an old sea widow.
Lost her husband years ago.
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.
Did you just make that up?
Yeah.
You want to take the helm?
- Me?
- Yeah, you.
Come on.
- I can't do that.

- Hey.
- Hey, Jack.
Personal calls on your own time, okay?
- Yeah?
- Um, did you get my message?
You had a phone call this morning...
...with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.
Shit.
I can just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.
Did you book our rooms for New York yet?
Sorry?
New York. Book expo.
This Friday. It's in the diary.
N... Yeah, I know, yeah,
I booked your room. Of course.
And you.
It's expected that my assistant
also attends.
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.
Don't apologize.
Just get yourself a room.
Unless you'd rather stay back
with your boyfriend.
I mean, it's not like you need to work.
I'll sort it out.
Eric, hey, it's Jack.
How was your weekend?
<i>No shit?</i>
Hey, no, mine, mine was great.
It was fantastic.
Yeah, 'cause I read your new pages.
No, they're amazing. Amazing.
No, I couldn't put it down.
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants, of course...
...but more than 70% of the funding...
...will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.
We'll be making cutting-edge
renewable energy tech...
...that will more than
repay our investment.
Because GEH operates for the long term.
Call it... enlightened self-interest...
...but it's always been the Grey
philosophy that a motivated...
...highly skilled,
well-paid workforce...
...builds a strong community.
That in turn...
...provides a solid consumer
base for our products.
We're aware that you have other
bidders, and some of them...
...may offer
what look like better terms.

<i>You know, at some point...</i>
<i>...we're gonna need
to talk about New York.</i>
We have talked about it.
You forbidding it
is not us talking about it.
If you want to go to New York,
don't go with Hyde.
Let me take you...
I have a place there.
Of course you do.
This isn't some sort of vacation.
It's a work trip with my boss,
who I would like to impress.
You know he's had three assistants...
...in the last 18 months, all
of whom quit without notice?
You don't think I can handle him?
That's not it.
That's what it feels like.
Ana, I know full well
that you can handle anything.
And, uh, if you really want to go...
...then... I can't stop you.
But I'd like to take you there myself.
<i>♪ Empty pack of cigarettes and you... ♪</i>
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
I... I mean, of course I would
rather see New York with you.
Good.
I hate it when we fight.
That wasn't a fight.
That was a conversation.
It was, you know, when somebody talks...
...and the other person listens
and you resolve an issue.
That's how it works.
It's crazy, isn't it?
Good night, Ana.
Good night, Hannah.
You leaving?
Um, I was actually just
about to come talk to you...
...uh, about New York.
There a problem?
Um...
I'm so grateful for the
opportunity, Jack...
...but with such short notice,
I made plans that I can't change.
- Huh.
- But I will have my phone on me...
...all weekend, so if you
need anything, I'm available.
Ana, have a seat.
I'm really... I'm sorry.
I think you have
tremendous potential here.
But I don't want to waste
my time training...
...someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.
I do. Um...
This is my dream job.
Well, then shouldn't
going to New York...
...and the book expo
be part of that dream?
It is.
It is. Um, uh...
It was just a misunderstanding.
- It won't happen again.
- Because there are plenty...
...of qualified people
who would kill for this job.
I mean, look, I don't want to brag...
...but I'm a pretty great teacher.
I'm sure you are.
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.
I've read more than you've asked me to.
And I...
I... I'm on top of every...
I'm talking about going the extra mile.
Unless you want me to...
...compete with Christian Grey...
...for your attention.
I'm... I apologize...
...that... Christian was so curt
with you the other night.
Is that what this is about?
Your boyfriend...
...has a reputation for being...
...a little ruthless.
Is that what you like?
If you have a problem with my work...
...then you should take it up with HR.
Whoa. Why are you being so serious?
Wh... What do you think I'm gonna do...
- ...make you fuck me?
- Jack.
I just think...
I just think...
...if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence...
...that you should do it with someone...
...who can at least make you smarter.
Not just richer.
Right?
- Don't...
- Don't what? Hmm?
Now, this is a serious...
Serious question.
Do you want to be kept...
...or taken seriously?
- Hmm?
- I would like to leave, please, Jack.
Plus...
I can make you come...
...like nobody else has.
Not him.
- Not anyone.
- No.
Ana? Ana, what happened?
Jack... Hyde.
Jack tried to...
- ...to touch me.
- I'll kill him.
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.
Okay. Go.
It's okay. Hey.
I left everything.
I don't have any of my stuff.
Taylor will get it. Taylor
will get it. It's fine, okay?
I'll take you home. Come on.
And his pass has been canceled?
Good.
No. Thank you, Jerry.
Good night.
Well, at least that's dealt with.
Hyde's out. He's been fired.
Whoa.
How? That's...
You... I...
But I thought your deal...
...with SIP hasn't been finished yet.
It's not.
But I know the CEO.
I told him what happened.
You'll never have to see him again.
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?
Well, if you don't, you can...
you can just...
Christian, you know I love working.
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.
What if I gave you a key?
I mean...
What if you had a key...
...and you kept some
of your stuff here...
You can keep all of your stuff here...
And...
And you slept, you know...
...not at your place?
Are you asking me to
move i... in with you?
Mm-hmm.
Are you sure?
Yes.
I want you here all the time.
As soon as possible.
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?
Well, that's just one
of the many things...
...that we can talk about
over breakfast.
Can I think about it?
Sure.
Yeah.
Liz, hi.
Ana. Don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.
In kind of a hurry.
SIP isn't recruiting right now,
so we're screwed.
So you don't need me anymore, then?
We're gonna try to find you
something temporary.
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?
At the senior editors' meeting?
Just for today.
You're the only one...
...who knows Jack's entire slate.
Well, yeah, but I.. I.. I...
You're right, it's too much.
No, I can do it.
It's fine. I can do it.
Great.
Call me when you're done.
We need to print fewer titles.
Stick with established authors...
...focus on our core readership.
Ex... Expand it.
I'm sorry?
Um, uh...
So, Ana, what do you think
we should be publishing?
Um, well, newer voices.
- Along with your established authors.
- Uh..huh.
Boyce Fox, for example, got...
...80,000 hits last week.
- Really?
- <i>Online hits...</i>
<i>...don't automatically
translate to print sales.</i>
Well...
But they could.
His online audience is in the
18-to-24 demographic...
...and those are exactly the readers...
...that we should be chasing.
Um, I mean, I can show you the stats.
I really... I think
he's worth taking a risk on.
Maybe we should take a look.
W...
Great idea.
Uh, Ana? Ana, just, uh...
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?
Um, well, Liz mentioned
something temporary.
- I.. I don't know.
- Okay.
So why don't you fill in
for Jack temporarily?
- Good?
- Um...
Great. Okay.
That's settled.
<i>To SIP's new fiction editor.</i>
Acting fiction editor.
Till they find out how good you are.
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?
No.
Hey, it was all you.
What, you don't believe me?
I don't believe it myself.
I asked you a question last night.
About moving in with you?
Emmh.
I just think that I'm probably...
I need to get some things
from my apartment.
That can be arranged.
Good.
Now, maybe we could take
this celebration home.
The check, please.
Take off your panties.
Do it now.
Right in here?
Yeah, right here. Now.

No, of course not.

- Ana, please don't do this.
- Christian.
Don't give up on me.
I just need to think a little bit.
Don't leave me.
What are you doing?
Get up.
What are you doing?
Look at me.
Look at me.
I'm scared.
I know you say that I'm enough.
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting...
...that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.
And it might be fine for right now...
...but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?
I won't.
How do you know that?
How can I believe you?
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.
- It doesn't...
- I'm not a dominant.
I'm not. I...
The right term is a sadist.
I get off on punishing women,
women who look like you and...
Like your mother.
Yes.
And I know how fucked up that is.
When you left, I swore
that I would stop it...
...if that's what it took
to get you back.
But I'm done with it.
You mean more to me than anything else.
I want to believe you.
I do.
- But I can't. I...
- Ana, give me your hand.
This is me.
All of me.
Christian.
And I'm all yours.
<i>No.</i>
No!
Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- No.
It's okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here.
Marry me.
What?
I want you to marry me.
Christian, I think you're dreaming.
<i>♪ You look as if

Good morning.
Morning.
Sleep okay?
I did. You?
Like a log.
Out all night.
Hmm.
You didn't have any weird dreams
or anything...
...or, like, wake up at all?
No.
I mean, none that I can think of.
Hmm.
I mean, there was a little thing...
...of asking you to marry me,
but, uh, aside from that...
...no, nothing.
Don't mess with me like that.
No?
How should I mess with you?
Like this?
Huh?
That better?
I meant it.
I want to marry you.
Why?
Because I want to spend every second...
...of the rest of my life with you.
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.
I know I'm complicated.
Just a little bit.
<i>You have an assistant?</i>
I thought you were an assistant.
It's a long story.
What's going on?
What do I give Christian
for his birthday?
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.
Uh, his wh... his birthday?
When is his birthday?
Sunday. He didn't tell you?
He is so weird.
Mom and Dad are throwing him a party.
Didn't they just have a party?
Geez, you're as bad as he is.
That was a ball.
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.
No biggie.
Hey, what about a tie?
Uh, uh, Christian has a lot of ties.
Socks, suspenders...
Throw me a bone here?
Um, oh.
God, Mia, I got to go.
Okay, okay. But Sunday
or I'll hunt you down myself.
Bye.
Ooh. Perfect.
- Do you have a gift box?
- One second.
Hey.
<i>Mm.</i>
- Miss Steele.
- Hmm.
How was your day?
Looking up, Mr. Grey.
Where's Taylor?
He went to get my bag.
Your bag? Where are you going?
Ros and I have to go
to Portland for some meetings.
I'll be back tomorrow night.
Hey, come on.
When were you gonna tell me
about your birthday?
Your parents are throwing you a party.
Were we just gonna stay home?
They do this every year.
Um, yeah, birthday.
My, uh, arrival in the world...
...isn't something
I feel like celebrating.
Well, I feel like celebrating it.
Can't open it till the day though.
Then why give it to me now?
Call it delayed gratification.
Is that...
Is that Mount St. Helens?
I changed the flight plan,
get us over sooner.
Great.
Y.. You realize that's a volcano, right?
Relax, Ros.
If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.
Oh.
Lucky me.
Ch.. Christian, what is that?
Don't worry.
- Oh, my God! Christian!
- Fuck!
Oh, no, shit.
Shit. Christian, what is going on?
- Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
- What is happening?!
- Damn it.
- Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, Christian!
Stop it! Oh, no!
Christian!
There.
There, there, there!
- Oh, you remember this guy?
- Oh, the one with the...
- <i>Kate!</i>
- Oh!
Yes! Oh!
Hi!
Oh, my God, you're so tan...
- ...and glowing.
- Oh, I know.
You want a beer, Ana?
Yes! Please, please.
- Hi, José.
- Hey.
Hi. How's it going?
So? Congratulations, Fiction Editor.
Right? She's a big deal now.
And how's, uh, your hottie?
Uh, Christian is good.
Um, uh, he asked me to move in with him.
What?
<i>Ana's moving in with Christian.</i>
<i>Oh, that's great.</i>
You know, we could use the privacy.
He's so subtle, it kills me.
Stop.
So you're serious.
But are you happy?
'Cause that's all I care about.
I... Well, I mean,
it's complicated, but I'm...
- I've never been happier.
- <i>Hey, Mia. What's up?</i>
Did you hear about José's show?
It was incredible.
Really. He was amazing.
- He got rave reviews.
- I got to check it out.
Wait, wait, Mia. Slow down.
Sh.. Shit. Okay.
Yeah, yeah, we're on our way.
Um, Christian's chopper went missing...
...on the way back from Portland.
They're sending out
search parties right now.
Come on, let's go.
<i>For more on this breaking story...</i>
<i>...let's go out to the field...</i>
<i>...and our reporter Rachel Taylor.</i>
Rachel?
Thank you, John.
I'm speaking to you live...
...from the private helicopter
terminal at Seattle.
They'll find him.
He'll be okay.
It's Christian.
The helicopter was
an Airbus Helicopters H130...
<i>Yeah. Is there
anything we can do?</i>
<i>And Christian Grey,
although only 27 years old...</i>
<i>...had extensive flying experience.</i>
All right, bye.
<i>One of Seattle's
youngest billionaires...</i>
<i>...Grey is the charismatic head
of Grey Enterprises Holdings...</i>
<i>...a multinational conglomerate
and nearly...</i>
<i>...Jesus, will someone shut them up?</i>
No, please.
Leave it on.
Just turn it down please, José.
Thank you.
You're shivering.
I'll get you a sweater. Okay.
Ana. Tea.
He's gonna be fine.
He has to be okay.
We haven't had any time.
We need to have more time.
You're going to have plenty of time.
We are so glad that
you're here with us...
...and in Christian's life.
You've made such a difference to him.
He never let anyone get...
...close until you came along.
Grace, he adores you.
I know, but children grow apart
from their parents...
...and that's... that's fine,
as long as they're happy.
And he is happy with you.
And that's all I ever wanted.
<i>Turn it up.</i>
<i>...that Christian
Grey and his colleague...</i>
<i>...Ros Bailey have been
found safe and well...</i>
<i>...and are at this moment
on their way back to Seattle.</i>
<i>Sources tell us their helicopter
had to make a...</i>
<i>What the hell are you all doing here?</i>
Christian! Oh, my God!
- Oh, thank God.
- <i>Christian!</i>
How did you get here?
<i>Later, Mia.</i>
<i>What happened? Oh, my God.</i>
Why didn't you call?
<i>I.. I had an accident.
I lost my phone.</i>
<i>We know.
It's been all over the news.</i>
<i>I'm fine. Ros is fine.</i>
<i>- Dad. He's here.
- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>He just walked in.</i>
- I'm okay.
- <i>I mean, he looks like shit...</i>
- <i>...but he's in one piece.</i>
- No, he doesn't.
- Hey.
- <i>Yeah, he does.</i>
- <i>Okay. Call you back.</i>
- Guys, relax, I'm fine.
- Okay?
- Come here, man.
- Need to say hi to my girl.
- Okay.
<i>Come on, Mom.</i>
I told you they'd be okay.
<i>I need a drink.</i>
<i>Me, too.</i>
Miss me?
<i>- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, my God.</i>
- I thought...
- Hey, hey.
Ana, it's all right.
Ana, I'm here.
I was so scared.
I was so scared.
Hey.
I thought I lost you forever.
Not a chance.
I'm here.
That's when all my instruments lit up.
We had a fire in the tail,
lost both engines.
Both of them?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.
We hit 'em pretty hard, but luckily...
...we were both
able to crawl out of there.
Thank goodness.
Thank God.
Sorry, guys, but I got to take off.
<i>Okay.</i>
José, thanks for being here.
Means the world to Ana.
Of course.
Hey, welcome home, Mr. Grey.
Christian, please.
Well, it's late...
...and these two should get some rest.
<i>Yes.</i>
Grace, shall we?
Yeah, I think we're going
to head home, too, bro.
<i>Cool.</i>
We'll walk you guys.
Kind of hate to say this...
...but your guy's all right.
I'm glad he's okay...
...and I'm glad you're happy.
Thank you.
Will we be seeing you
tomorrow at his party?
Don't push it.
Come here. Mm.
<i>I'm okay, Mom.</i>
I know.
- <i>Mom.</i>
- Okay.
We'll see you tomorrow, Ana.
<i>Yeah, good night.</i>
It's after midnight.
I'm not tired.
No.
It's your birthday.
Yeah.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
Do you still have that gift I gave you?
You know you didn't have to.
All I want is you.
Just open it.
Okay.
Key chain.
Turn it over.
Does this mean yes, yes?
Yes.
Yes, yes, yes.
Wait.
So this whole time,
I had the answer in my pocket?
Anastasia Steele,
what am I gonna do with you?
Take me to the Red Room.
Take me.
Take me to the Red Room.
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
Yes.

- Mom?
- Hi.
Ana, sweetheart, where have you been?
I know, I've been...
I.. I'm sorry.
Work has been so crazy.
I hope they're not overworking you.
No, no, it's actually...
It's going really well.
Um, but I was calling because I, um...
...I wanted to talk to you
about Christian.
Christian?
You've heard from him?
Yeah, we got back together.
Honey.
That's wonderful.
This time it's going to last.
I know it is.
I hope you're right because...
...um... he asked me to marry him...
...and I said yes.
Mom?
You're not...?
No, no, I'm not pregnant.
Um...
I know that we haven't been
together very long...
...but...
But I just...
I love him so much.
He's the one.
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm so happy for you.
- You are?
- Of course.
You've always known your own mind.
If that man is the love of your life...
...you grab him with both hands.
Thanks, Mama.
Have you called Ray?
Um, no, not yet.
Um, Christian did, though.
He asked for his permission.
He asked for your hand?
That's so chivalrous.
I don't think she's
gotten one of these.
<i>Cheers.</i>
Hey.
Hey.
Champagne, Mr. Grey?
Thanks, Gretchen.
And can I just say happy birthday?
Sure. Thank you.
- Christian.
- Mom.
- Oh. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.
- Mmm. And Ana.
- Hi.
It's so good to see you again.
You saw us last night.
Yes. And because of that...
...I am never taking anything
for granted, ever again.
<i>Hey.</i>
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine, Elena. Thank you.
- Oh!
Ana, let me introduce to you
my good friend Elena Lincoln.
Uh, we met at the masquerade.
Yes.
Nice to see you again.
<i>Excuse us.</i>
Surely.
She's fantastic.
Ladies, gentlemen, Mia.
I want to thank you all
for coming here this evening.
I was expecting
a small family gathering.
Thanks, Mia.
Uh, but I'm happy
that you're all here...
...because I have
an announcement to make.
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters...
...and how important it is
to seize the day.
We should cherish
the people we care about...
...and... and who care about us.
Mom, Dad...
...I know I haven't always
been the perfect son...
...but I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.
<i>Hear, hear.</i>
Oh, here.
But that's not the announcement.
Ana, come up here a second, please.
So a while ago, I was lucky enough...
...to meet this amazing
young woman, Anastasia Steele.
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one...
...I wanted to share my life with.
So I asked her to marry me.
And she said yes.
Oh, that is so...
- I'm thrilled, Ana.
- Come here, bro.
- Welcome to the family.
- <i>Thank you.</i>
<i>And if I cry any more,
I'm just going to dehydrate.</i>
- Welcome.
- Oh, my God, don't do that.
Congratulations.
Stop crying, Mom.
Can't help it.
- I love you so much.
- I love you.
Well done, big brother.
Ring. Show me the ring.
Oh, we're gonna choose it together.
No rock.
Christian Grey.
Oh, my God, I have a sister!
Ana!
<i>Thanks, Jim.</i>
Grace and I are so proud.
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks and this is what happens?
I know. I'm...
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you.
- Oh, please.
- Come here.
- Oh.
Mm.
So, how does it feel to bag...
...Seattle's most eligible bachelor?
It's a little scary, but...
Well, if anyone can make
it work, it's you.
Hey, sis-in-law.
Congratulations.
Christian's a very lucky guy.
You, however, are certifiably insane.
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Uh, Mia wants to taste
one of your killer cocktails.
Oh, well, coming right up.
I see you heeded our little talk.
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?
You don't care about Christian.
He'll see that.
I'll make sure of it.
He'll see right through you.
It's over for you, Elena.
You're just a mousy
little thing after his money.
He's not capable of marriage.
Thank you, Christian.
<i>Why are you even here, Elena?</i>
She's not right for you.
You don't know what's right for me.
You taught me how to fuck, Elena.
Ana taught me how to love.
She's just the next one in line.
Get out of my house.
Leave my children alone...
...and get the hell out of my house.
Ana, darling...
...would you give us
a moment alone, please?
I'm sorry about that.
Is your mom okay?
- Furious.
- Hmm.
Elena's gone.
Like gone, gone?
I'm done.
The business, everything.
I'll have my people sort out
the details tomorrow.
I know she was important to you.
I'm sorry.
Are you?
- No.
- No.
What's that you got there?
Come with me.
There's something I need to show you.
<i>Last time we came down here...</i>
<i>...I was over your shoulder.</i>
Oh, yeah.
After you.
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
You wanted hearts and flowers.
- Oh, my God!
- It's okay.
It's okay.
Christian.
This is amazing.
Be mine.
Share my life with me.
Yes.
Marry me.
I'll marry you.
Give me your hand.
Did you do that?
- Bravo!
- Bravo!
It's beautiful.
Ah!
- It's great, isn't it?
- Oh, that's so pretty.
- Mm.
- Oh, look!
