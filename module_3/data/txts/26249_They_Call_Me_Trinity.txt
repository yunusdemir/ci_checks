She did not want to.
He left.
Should be judged.
The judge's wife fell into place.
And it would have remained there if
the man would not come.
- It was bound.
- Your friend chose the wrong bed.
The law is the law and even if you do not
understand, it must be respected.
You have one minute to exit the city.
This is your last warning.
Release him our friend.
Guys, it seems to be
to choose a new sheriff.
- Hey, you...
Yes, Paduchiosu.
I think he refers to them.
Drop sheath.
Now it's your turn, sheriff.
Drop it.
They'll die before I managed to retire EASC.

Put your finger inside.
You're always gringos
" nis hiijos the Putas."

A good idea...
Sleep easy.
Tomorrow you can take him to
you to his beloved wife.
- Yet quickly retreat...
- Yes, thank you for"help".
- There were only three.
- Yes, this time.
But many more will come
in this town dirty.
Better to disappear before
the brothers" gunmen" to come.
- I do not want any trouble.
- Have you been involved in and something else?
This smells burnt.
- Who is he?
- My brother.
It's just in passing.
Leaving tomorrow.
So he smelled when he came.
I had three pieces
soap- up to clean it.
Would you shake hands with me,
you must first wash.
I do not want tetanus.
What does that mean?
- How'd you like that?
- I was tracked.
The one who holds the sheriff badge?
Two days after I escaped
from prison in Yuma...
...
He does not follow me,
have just the same way with me.
I never knew that, so that I shot.
Later I learned that he had to
replace the sheriff who had been shot.
He had sheriff badge in his pocket.
I took place.
- To me the wait people.
Go to California.
I plan to give it a break,
but to us you're starter.
I do not know how, but
to make sure.
This is not a prison but a crapper.
Reminds me of beats in the bar,
when you were gone.
Officers have beaten two peasants.
I am now able to eat only gray and
that those officers are lathe to the floor.
They were armed?
Peasants are certainly not
armed, and Sheriff.
Let us get your take a bath
before becoming a pig.
Wash and tomorrow you're gone.
- See you.
- No, see you later!
- You're really brothers?
- Yes.
We have the same mother.
I have seen so much dirt from
when Pecci flew by.
This is the last time!
It should be a great chaos in the city?
Are you thinking of course the people officers.
They break peasants hands and feet.
But peasants back.
- Why not fight?
- It's against their faith.
These people are freaks east.
They do nothing but pray and
to work, to pray and to work...
- What will my brother?
- None.
I've never seen a
sheriff so unlucky.
When something happens, there are
elsewhere and vice versa.
Always been unlucky.
If I knew that you take your zdrenþele
stuff, Did not I would have given the last soap.
- Good, And Sheriff.
- Shut up.
- What about him?
- As always.
- People the officer?
- Yes.
Farewell...
I want to go to bed.
We do not review, so as luck.
Officer, I start to get tired of your hooligans.
Let alone give the peasants,
either get the guns.
- Why did you do that?
- Yes, why not?
Be understanding, and Sheriff.
Cowboys who work hard have
need little fun Sunday.
Like peasants beat
deprived of defense?
Peasants must induce different
i become too lazy
That's normal.
Did not know?
Mind your own business and let me do it
and my people alone.
All right.
What did you say?
Hoth bumps.
There is only one way to act.
And to tell you frankly, I do not like.
Guys, listen.
What's wrong with you Jeff.
And sheriff starts to annoy me.
It's a bit stupid to understand the
what it takes us this town
So you must learn it through
the hardest way.
They work hard but
the officer does not care.
Wants to have around
valley for horses.
Forget it, you're not ª sheriff..
I know...
If the army comes cause much clutter.
Before my boys to reach.
- He must win.
- Why?
Outside the valley is the most beautiful and
and horses that I've seen.
Nemarcaþi.
If you ban the peasants of the valley and
and bring their horses who will care?
- That's helpful.
- Officer...?
Peasants.
It's easier said than done.
No one in town will not
the officer against people.
And I will not succeed this alone.
No, no.
Yes...!
There...!
- For a dollar a day?
- No.
And ammo..?
And accommodation and meals...?
And you're going to persuade the old man Jonathan

An understanding...?
No.

- Welcome, Major.
- I welcome?
- We do not lie.
- Just hide the truth.
If so miraculously disappear
in front of your eyes...

We do not want such a miracle.
Only a sense of our poverty.
There is nothing more irritating
than a hypocrite.
I've come here with Caruth
with zdrenþe and much hope.
A lot of faith, Major.
And after a few months they emerged
by chance he supposes and your brothers.
And then" faith" can build
a house to fit within an army...
Fold and fill with cheese.
That must be a
worthy poverty and profitable.
- God has Dacian wild cows.
- And that you fast then you have marked.
While I and my horses hit
feet of rocks...
your cows gain weight and so i
and that will be multiplied.
All we want is a piece of
land where we can live.
This" piece" is on
12000 tons of earth, my friend.
Only a small part.
's Enough for all.
Leave vo and three horses to graze here.
We have nothing against.
No...
Get your things, people, gutters,
cows and get out of my valley.

- You can still do 3000 km longer.
- We have children...
- I hate children.
I tried to speak to the
highest simþãminte yours.
But I have to remind you that
we came first in the valley.
I believe that God said:
The last shall be first.
- And so why hurry?
- It's bad to be cynical.
- E practical.
- May God forgive you.
I hope, but do not think this would happen.
Let this be a reminder, old man.
Whether you leave the valley or bury you here.
You can choose one.

Everybody knew not promise anything good.

- To greet the newcomers.
I hope you doing not fight?
- I hate people sigh of relief.
- Let this and stay here with me!
What would people do without horses?
Great Caesar, Alexander the Great...
Great men of Spain...
It would have been great without horses?
What would have been formed nation
so without this noble animal...?
This debt could be paid
better than by giving them...
're green meadows where graze and
to grow in peace?
So I want that valley to
be mine at any cost.
And if you convince them
the peasants to leave...
I will reward you with a large amount o
allows you to Withdraw.
- Valley is already you, officer.
- Good.
But first you need to make busy
to ª sheriff and the deputy sheriff.
They disturb us the most.
- Can You very well appoint a new sheriff.
- I'll do that.
A glass of sherry?
It's coming...
No thank you, officer.
Do you work.
That's what I call service to have your take seriously.
Watch the deputy sheriff.
's Very fast.
You heard Mortimer...?
ª Sheriff's Deputy rapidly.

- To see the surroundings.
It's one day quiet Tita...
Therein lies the
quick vice sheriff, Mortimer.
Can I help you with something and vice Sheriff?
Are you interested in something in particular...?
Yes.
- What about the horses?
- No time.
He said 10 seconds.
You had nothing to do with this, right?
And Sheriff, the city was peaceful
before coming madness.
He can not shoot and hit that
the citizens of our...
you just because you
give the sheriff badge.
I want you and the sheriff deputy
to give your resignation.
Otherwise you will have to talk to
my friend the governor.
We can not let them get away out of this.
Cursed be the day you were born.
You're worse than pure evil.
What to do with Mexicans?
- Get them out.
- It can not stand.
Give him whiskey and Make him sleep.
- Issues...
- Nothing special.
We put a bounty on my head.
The new sheriff And I took the badge
not dead, leaving just lame.
And follow me now.
And now I ask for help...
that I may find myself.
$ 200...?
Are you thinking to denounce
on your own brother?
This is an insult...
Not for $ 200 prãpãdiþi.
- Come with me?
- Where?
You rely on the fact that I never
that I will not shoot, do not you?
No.
Why do not you ever teach?
Go home mother in New Orleans.
Take with you a few girls
the Mothers and sons.
Get out now.
- Farewell.
If I felt like, I'd be stuck.
I think not.
Good to see you, brother.
What brings you here?
Nothing.
You were our angel guns.
God be with you.
But if you're decided to Stay
here, you're welcome.
Thanks, but I have to go.
It's a shame.
But how do tulle.
Before you go to Sarah and Judith
'd like to get your thank the.
I'm down at the water.
- I'll send someone after them.
- On going there anyway.
You'll enjoy.
- E Trinity.
- Welcome, brother.
Come...
Hot water.
And not your horse!
He can swim.
I do.
Far.
Oh, but...
What are you...?
From the first moment I saw you I
want you to stay with us.
I thought.
You could have your make a house here...
with devoted spouses who care for you.
Wife...?
You knew that to allow our faith
men to have multiple wives?
This becomes deeper.
Farewell.
Leaving?
If your invitation still stands,
there is still one day.
All we will share with you.
There is no way
to stop the officer?
He never cancel.
Vine, before you realize you.
Our destiny is in God's hands.
He has no weapons, so that
we are helpful.
God probably is not you
mind if you defend.
We can not kill people.
Bastards are worse than snakes.
You will not be able to return
always cheek.
We will see what the Lord wants.
I hope that he has a gun.
You could get rid of all the band.
...
We propose...
Who could it be?
Looks like you some bother tourists.
Or two fugitives without any law.
Lord and he walked the fields.
But he had no army on his tail.
Ask him what you want.
If something happens behind you.
Give to him who is thirsty
BEA says in the Bible.
There is the saying:
Give the starving food...?
No!
You're Røyskatt, is not it?
And you're Flaumann...?
And you look on the Bambino?
You know where it is?
Yes, we are waiting for you.
What are you doing here?
Hey, boss.
I rotted there for several weeks.
I thought you were hanged.
I took her to gallop
because we pursued one.
We have retired and then I shot.
And that was a lame sheriff.
He is not chasing us.
I was just the same way.
- Did you kill him?
- Almost.
What's with that badge?
I hide behind the law.
Listen to me.
A pleasant work awaits us.
Like a ripe plum.
Cows?
Cai!
The most beautiful herd of stallions
we mark with iron red.
How you knew that I'm here?
I said.
Listen here, Bambino...
I do not want to listen.
I just want to say...
Get out!
You heard the boss...?
I have something very important to tell you.
I saw the officer on the way
towards bordering Mexico.
Means that it will stop at Mezcal.
Peasants did not have any chance.
Help me get rid of sheriff ª and
then get married.
- Get married.
- Who...?
Sarah and Judith.
I have not decided yet.
I'll lay here
peasants...
Definitely...?
Yes, forever.
I want to forget the past.
Our old mother swears by.
Whether it becomes a woman's honor,
if I lie.
This is an agreement between us.
I'll help you.
Whether our paths split...
I'll not be sorry.
As respects the officer, I thought...
- I'm the one who's thinking.
- That's what I thought and I.
Idiot!
Gringos...!
It's nice that officer.
It has a lot of money.
- Stay here in the shade.
- Thank you.
How do we go our
large enemy mine?
Now I'm your best friend...!
Your people shot at us yesterday.
If you steal my horse I'll be
need to let them shoot you down.
But if you work for me, you have horses.
20...
Mezcal will rob Texas
for 20 stallions.
There is a special way of
eradicate the worm's that?
That and you have to decide yourself.
- Just one thing...
- And that is?
Let me steal 20 horses
after work.
A work is humiliating.
Stealing is a pleasure.
Jeff, people have to steal
the Mezcal 20 horses.
Without Catur shot this time.
Collided on the 20 stallions.
- When we attack...
- When will the least expect it.
Send a spy to follow them
and then let me know.
'll Send Emiliano.
Is capable of approaching hats
men without them - and realizing.
Thought that they would come 20...
gunmen all together.
If you will not use the weapons you
fertilizers and the earth with your bodies.
Our faith forbids violence.
November 4 Just do not think we
could keep the officer chest.
You need to ask the Lord
a temporary solution.
Do you get that quick, man.
We have to decide now.
Otherwise we will have no hope.
We will only appear.
Do not want to kill.
And that's fine.
OK...
to begin.
When someone is heading by hand
straight to you what you do?
We gathered with the left and
then hit the right.
repeat
You enforce the left and knock the right.
Trying.
Break with the left...
See what's happening...
It's a matter of precision.
What do you do if you throw one
a filler citizen you?
I do not know.
Watch and down...
- Understand?
- Yeah, man.
Ready?
No...!
Look here to see what to do.
Look at me.
Prepare?
Remember...
Experience is the best teacher.
If you are unable to
move the hands, should
you use legs...
Upstairs, it's your turn to try.
Throw it up and then down.
- A quick take on...
- No time to lose.
EASC'll succeed.
I thought...
If it's advice, keep it to yourself.
I just want to get your opinion heard.
Tell.
Do you think it's someone we
spying under that sombrero?
- It's a serious chance.
- That's what I was thinking and I.
Come here.
Try each other.
Up there, in the sombrero is
certainly a spy.
Bring it.
Alive!
- Problems
- nothing important.
There's a man up the cliff...
Røyskatt invite him up here.
Heaven to guard our friend.
And the spy.
If you're waiting for, you will talk.
Who sent you?
Emiliano not betray anyone.
Emiliano says it all.
U are one of the people of Mezcal.
