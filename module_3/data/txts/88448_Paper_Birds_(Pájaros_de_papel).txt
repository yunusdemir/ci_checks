PAPER BIRDS
Late again, Mr. Del Pino.
I'm sorry. I work nights.
- You're late every day.
- Don't worry, it won't happen again.
- Boys, the siren went off.
- Okay, Paco.
Let's go home.
- Hi, Jorge, Maria.
- Hi, Antonio!
- How's your wife?
- Fine, fine!
Come on, Rafa. Go to sleep,
you have school tomorrow.
Dad, we're at war!
That's news! I know we are,
but you have to go to school.
- Can't I miss tomorrow?
- No way.
You can't miss school
and I can't miss work.
That's the deal, man to man.
- "Man to man."
- That's right.
- Hand it over.
- No.
I haven't finished yet.
I can't get it right.
Don't worry,
you can practice tomorrow.
Come on, go to sleep.
Rafa, ten lines and lights out.
I'm running out of candles.
All right.
I don't have much time, son.
I just wanted
to kiss you good night.
Hey! Did you do your homework?
Why not?
Don't give me that
"we're at war" stuff!
That we're at war!
Rafa, son, I'm about to go onstage.
I'll see you in the morning.
Big kiss.
No, I love you more.
Go on, put your mother on.
Hello.
The crowd is great.
One of the best I've ever seen.
Don't worry, darling. We'll pay it
next week, no matter what.
Can you hear me?
Maria! Maria!
- Damn it! It got cut off again!
- We're at war.
Yeah, but these phone lines
are more like enemy lines.
- Oh, that's hilarious!
- Come on, we have to go on!
Jesus Christ, take it easy. There
are more important things in life.
- Isn't that right?
- Trying to get paid? Is that it?
Did he just say the magic word?
Paid!
Don't give him a cent, he'll blow it.
- Go on, sign.
- 25 pesetas?
More than you're worth.
You know how things are.
- Know what I like about you?
- No. What do you like about me?
- I don't know, I was asking you.
- You're on a roll tonight!
You should do Shakespeare.
- How's the crowd, Luis? Cold?
- Cold? They're dead!
- This isn't Madrid.
- Even Madrid isn't Madrid anymore.
If you really wanna be a hit,
repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit...
- Hey, watch it!
- Always messing around!
You're not playing
with my dogs anymore!
<i>My neighbor on the third floor,</i>
<i>he's as screwy as a bat.</i>
<i>He must be off his rocker,</i>
<i>yesterday he ran off just like that.</i>
<i>Why all of a sudden screwy?</i>
<i>You've known him your whole life.</i>
<i>Because the fool is so dumb</i>
<i>he ran away with my wife!</i>
<i>Give me a hand, Marilu.</i>
<i>Nobody makes the pain go away</i>
<i>quite like you do.</i>
<i>Last month I went under the knife,</i>
<i>they opened my stomach up wide.</i>
<i>But when they stitched me up,</i>
<i>they left a big sponge inside.</i>
<i>Imagine the discomfort,</i>
<i>it really is a crime.</i>
<i>Discomfort isn't a problem,</i>
<i>I'm just thirsty all the time.</i>
<i>Give me your hand, Marilu.</i>
<i>Nobody makes the pain go away</i>
<i>quite like you do.</i>
- No!
- Montpellier will be exciting!
I'm not going to France!
And much less Montpellier.
Think about rehearsing.
We have to rehearse.
- All right. Meet me at the Hesperides.
- Okay.
- But to rehearse.
- Don't be such a pest!
What do we do about
the new number?
Do it right. Goodbye.
- Which way is the subway station?
- This way! This way!
Want it?
It's yours.
Thank you.
Maria!
Maria!
Rafa!
Maria!
Rafa!
Rafa!
Rafa!
No!
MADRID, ONE YEAR LATER
Hello, Enrique. How are you today?
Fine. Can't complain.
Glad to hear it.
Because I can't find the words
to express my anger.
Besides, someone might report me.
You okay?
- How about some coffee?
- Yeah,
for a change.
Okay, for Cuenca. Two shows.
I need a young variety singer,
a tap dancer,
- clarinet, saxophone...
- Alto or tenor sax?
You can castrate him for all I care.
As long as he plays in tune.
- Pick me, Arturo!
- No, you can't, Merceditas.
I'm getting a permit
to work as a minor.
You may be young,
but you're no variety singer.
Arturo, I haven't worked in a month.
I'll do anything, really.
Even just for a meal...
Well, okay. I'll think it over.
- I can sing.
- Not you again!
Quit bugging me, kid!
Don't tell me, you sing now too?
Darn right I do!
Ever heard of the Peñaranda
de Bracamonte Boys Choir?
- Yeah. Have you sung with them?
- No, but I've heard of them, too.
- And I can do magic.
- Scram, kid! And quit bugging me!
Arturo, let him do a trick!
Poor kid...
Okay, show me what you've got.
It works better with a little music.
<i>- Et... voilà!</i>
- Good job!
They saw the trick
coming a mile away, kid.
Now get out of here
and quit bugging me.
Okay, but you might want
this back first.
Thanks.
Go rob people for a living,
you'll do just fine.
Plenty of competition out there.
I'm no thief! I'm an artist!
Arturo, with a little practice,
this kid could be very good.
And who's gonna teach him? You?
Besides...
Did your folks give you permission?
What's your name?
Miguel Puertas Maldonado.
Where are
Miguel Puertas Maldonado's parents?
In the East Cemetery, Mister Arturo.
Enrique, talk to the boy.
See if you can use him.
Okay, Miguel, have a seat.
You've been hanging around here
the last few days.
I met your parents once.
Good people, good artists.
- Can you really sing?
- Some.
- Some?
- Some.
- Can you dance?
- Some.
Can you play an instrument?
And don't say "some."
A little.
I can play a polka on the piano.
- And you sang with Caruso at La Scala.
- Never heard of it.
- Where do you live?
- In a boarding house.
- With my Auntie Isabelita.
- Isabelita Puertas?
No! Not Isabelita Puertas!
She doesn't live with anyone anymore.
She died after the war.
I live with the Cañizares family.
But they wanna get rid of me.
They say I eat enough for two
ration cards, and that's bull!
Get this straight, everyone!
A sextet means 6, not 8!
What I need is a new number...
I don't know, with music, comedy...
The usual stuff,
but something new!
I've got something.
I've been giving you work
for three weeks.
Arturo. Over here.
I've got something.
Though I'm a little rusty.
Hugging me like that'll make
your old boyfriends jealous.
Jealous! They know nothing about love,
and even less about friendship.
Liar.
What about this new son of yours?
- He's not my son!
- He's not my father!
Maybe we could work the kid
into a new routine.
My name's Miguel, sir.
Don't call me "sir."
I'm not exactly a gentleman.
You know what they say about kids.
They steal.
I wasn't stealing, it was a trick!
Nobody here believes me!
Nobody raises their voice to me.
You got that?
Keep quiet or I'll send you back
where you came from.
- I didn't do anything!
- Shut up!
Jorge, the kid doesn't seem
capable of something like that.
People like kids for being kids,
not for their talent.
He'll steal the crowd away from you,
you'll see.
My routine is a little out of date.
I'll figure something out.
And with you aboard...
Thank you, sir...
I mean, Enrique! Enrique!
Okay, okay! We have to okay it
with your guardian, right?
His name's Antonio,
but that isn't necessary.
Keep lying and I'll turn you over
to Social Services.
Shut up, kid!
- You came back.
- What did you expect?
Okay, then.
Monday at noon at the Infanta Isabel,
- like a general run through.
- We'll be there.
He won't pay us for the rehearsal.
I know.
Just another dress rehearsal.
You know what? I'm glad
certain traditions haven't been lost.
He's going to request asylum
the day of his conference
at the French embassy.
We'll arrange his escort
to the embassy that day.
Well, then.
Any news in the comedy world?
I was at the Hesperides this morning.
The Rivas' are touring Valencia
and nobody's heard from Torres Vidal.
Stay a couple more weeks and
don't take any shows out of town.
You're dismissed.
Colonel,
Jorge Del Pino has reappeared.
Del Pino?
So he's still alive.
Fine, you're dismissed.
See you next week.
I've been looking for you
all morning!
I should've taken you
to Social Services! Never again!
Hey!
- What are you doing?
- None of your business!
- Let's go! Get up or I'll drag you!
- I don't want to!
You don't want to! Don't you
talk back to me! Goddamn it!
- Don't even think about it.
- Get moving! Let's go!
No! I don't want to!
I won't go! I don't want to!
Are you this boy's guardian?
Yes.
Do you have his papers?
Come on, show me his papers.
Show me his papers!
Get out of here!
I was gonna hand him in
to Social Services anyway.
So we're even.
Thank you.
You froze up.
Like a Popsicle.
This is looking really good.
- Where did you learn that?
- Where did you learn how to sew?
Pour some more wine. You won't
be keeping the bottle or the cork.
Are you gonna tell me where the hell
you've been all this time?
I already told you. Around.
You disappear for a year
without a word,
I had no idea
where you sleep at night...
Wherever the night catches me.
Pass me the corkscrew.
There's more wine?
No, to pull the words out of you.
Jesus Christ!
- I don't feel much like talking.
- Yeah, I can see that.
Okay, it's all set.
Miguel Puertas Maldonado
is now officially a minor
in your charge, according to
the Government's new law.
- It looks genuine.
- It is genuine!
Thank you, sir. For the stamp.
Holy cow! We have another Picasso
here and we didn't even know it!
Thank you.
So, have I earned
some of that stew or not?
There's enough for three.
If there isn't enough for me,
it's okay.
I said there's enough for three.
I see you're still eating
Resistance food.
I can't resist it any longer.
Enrique, sir,
these lentils sure are tasty.
- I told you not to call me "sir"!
- "Ma'am" would be better.
What? Hey, if you make fun of me,
you get no dessert.
- What's for dessert?
- Oranges.
- Yeah. From China.
- Really?
Yeah. For you, at least.
He gets the peel.
- Liar.
- Mooch.
- Isn't everybody?
- Not everybody.
Miguel, get your elbow off the table!
Miguel, for God's sake!
Knock it off!
Where did you get this?
Get moving!
- But...
- Now!
- He tried to steal a banana!
- No, I didn't!
Kids and dogs, you knew that!
You asked for it.
- That's not true! You're saying...
- Shut your mouth.
- I don't want to.
- Yes, you do.
- Why won't you help me?
- No kids.
Just no.
Will you let me breathe?!
Give me a cigarette.
Hey, isn't that Merceditas?
- My bag.
- Hold on.
What are you doing here?
Where are you living now?
In a boarding house in Vallecas.
Until they kick us out.
This isn't for you, Merceditas.
Come by the theater on Monday.
- Arturo said there was nothing for me.
- Come by anyway, don't worry.
Now, go home.
Thank you.
Go on, you go home too.
- Did you get anything?
- Yes.
Just potatoes.
What about you?
- Move. I've got a pimple here, look.
- Enrique, did you perform with him?
- Yeah.
- And where are you? I can't see you.
- That was me.
- You were..."and many other?"
Yeah. I was "And many other incredibly
talented, highly-renowned performers".
- Come in!
- Good evening, Enrique.
- Good evening.
- I'm sorry, but this can't go on.
Three people are living here
and you're only paying for one.
Ah! I have something for you.
Good evening.
I promised you one, right?
- When are you going on tour?
- Well,
it may be a couple more nights.
- Three, four at the most.
- No, that's too long.
- And with the boy as well...
- My name's Miguel, ma'am.
He looks like a good boy,
but you can only stay one more night.
- No, please, lady! Don't hit me!
- What are you doing?
- I don't want to be hit anymore!
- No, dear child...
- The kid's good. Did you see that?
- Yeah.
We don't do that sort of thing here.
Calm down.
Miguel, please, get up.
You can stay.
- Really?
- Yes.
Thank you, ma'am.
And come with me.
I'll get you something to eat.
- Do you like cheese?
- Yes.
The colonel worries
when people like him turn up.
Thank you.
- Remember the attempt on Franco?
- I heard about it.
There were plenty of rumors,
but they were never confirmed.
Red, please.
Well, it happened.
And one of the names that came up
was Jorge Del Pino,
a comedian.
A comedian?
I can't believe we have to worry
about people like this.
The enemy can be anyone.
By the way, how is your juggling?
Juggling?
Don't worry, Lieutenant.
I won't ask you to do anything
you've never done.
The colonel ordered me
to get you into Del Pino's company
- so you can keep me informed.
- Why not just arrest him?
No, no. Let the flock come together.
There's plenty of time
to send in the wolves.
- Enrique.
- What?
The kid, he's crying.
Miguel,
- what are you doing?
- He said we had to rehearse.
- Who did?
- Jorge.
Come on,
you can rehearse tomorrow.
- Now go to sleep.
- Good night.
Good night.
And put out that candle
before it runs out.
Okay, in a second.
Good night.
How are you today, my dear Sancho?
<i>Very well, thank you.</i>
<i>I'd like to play a little something.</i>
Then sing!
That's Señor Wences' number.
Hey, that's Wences' number!
I know it's Wences' number.
I'm just trying it out.
Besides, he said I could use it
before he went to America.
You people are getting on my nerves!
What's wrong, Jorge?
You've been avoiding me all day.
I've been working all day.
You know what I mean.
The fight must go on...
- Not for me.
- Sure.
But I'll let you know
if there's a meeting.
Then you can do whatever you want.
- Enough already...
- Okay then.
Amparo,
he was about to pee backstage.
Thank you, Pastor.
- Bad dog!
- Very naughty.
- Right, Miguel, come here.
- I'm ready.
No, not like that. Let me see.
Pretend you're a dummy.
Good, but not too limp.
Okay, on three, right?
One, two... and three.
Very good.
No, no. Put your hand here, Miguel.
- Why can't I put it here?
- Because! Your hand goes here.
- Here.
- Miguel!
Can I have a little silence, please?
- Can you hear me, Dummy?
- Yes.
Don't say "yes,"just nod your head.
Can you do that?
- Yes.
- Don't say "yes."
- Don't say "yes."
- Dummy!
- No! I mean "yes"!
- No, Miguel!
- One time and then you keep quiet.
- Why only one time?
The other dummies have more lines.
It's not fair!
The other dummies
have toured with me for years.
- You got that?
- Yes.
- Damn it!
- But Enrique! I made one mistake!
Hey, Enrique!
And you shut up, kid!
Nice kid, but he talks too much.
- Bring me the kid's papers.
- Okay, right.
There's nothing to worry about,
Captain.
I would never hire someone
without their papers in order.
Isn't that right, Jorge?
I got sent back to Madrid once
because my ID was unreadable.
They made me cross enemy lines
right in the middle of the war!
- Which enemy lines did you cross?
- As many as I could!
There were so many
I can't even remember.
It was so dark
you couldn't even see the enemy.
Because I crossed them at night!
- Save the comedy for the theater.
- This is a theater.
You're talking to a superior.
I'm not a soldier, I'm a comedian.
And since this is a theater,
I'm on hallowed ground.
Are you comparing this place
to a church?
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- We didn't come here to argue.
Here it is, I found it!
I was afraid it would get lost
so I hid it somewhere
and I couldn't...
"Miguel Puertas Maldonado..."
Age?
Nine.
- Date of birth?
- Yes, yes.
September 20th.
Yes, that's it, the 20th.
And your parents didn't object?
They allow you to participate
in these activities?
- Can you at least say yes or no?
- Jesus, answer him, Miguel.
Jesus is in Heaven.
And I'm standing right here!
Answer me right now!
Yes! Yes!
My parents didn't say anything
because they want what's best for me.
And I know how to do lots of stuff.
Wanna hear me play a polka
on the piano?
You may proceed.
- Thank you, Arturo.
- You're welcome, Captain.
I can't believe how much time
they make me waste with all this!
You took care of the boy's papers,
right? Well done, Jorge.
I missed having somebody around
to help me while you were...
- By the way, where were you?
- Excuse me. Jorge told me to come.
Honestly, I can't, Merceditas.
I can't afford it.
I'll do anything you ask of me:
Sing, slapstick, the Chinese Shadows
number... Anything you say!
Don't be a scrooge!
"Don't be a scrooge."
Damn it,
this isn't Social Services.
You're 16 years old.
- Another minor.
- Not anymore. I'm of age now.
You put my last name on it!
Too bad you can't forge a paella.
Arturillo, darling!
Where am I on the program?
Rocio, don't worry, I got it covered.
Well, I'll be in my dressing room
until you call me.
Don't worry.
Rocio, did you get your?
You mean my washbowl?
Yes, they brought it in.
Thank you so much, Jorge, darling.
My skin is very sensitive.
- From top to bottom.
- That's right. So what?
The sensitivity of a true artist
can manifest itself in many ways,
even on the skin itself.
You can say that again...
Well, that's variety singers for you.
That's hemorrhoids for you!
They swell up like apricots!
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your new dance,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
<i>I want you to show me,</i>
<i>and to learn the Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show it to me, show it to me,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
<i>To dance the Babaloo</i>
<i>glide gently on your feet.</i>
<i>Move your hips just right,</i>
<i>your heart will follow the beat.</i>
<i>Rumba dancers do it great</i>
<i>by always stepping in threes.</i>
<i>They rock their hips back and forth</i>
<i>and cross their legs with ease.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo...</i>
<i>Show me your new dance,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
You finish your make-up.
I'm going to warm up.
- Why do you do that?
- For my eyes.
So everyone in the audience
can see my eyes.
Jorge! You're late,
the Pizarros are already on.
Don't worry,
I'm on after the magician.
- No, the magician is on last.
- You're kidding.
Goddammit.
If you really wanna be a hit,
repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.
- Shit!
- Hey, watch it!
Why did he do that?
For good luck.
What did your parents do?
- My parents didn't do that stuff.
- They didn't?
They didn't like me saying things
that bring bad luck, like...
Don't even think about it!
After Jorge, Rocio is on
and then we sing "A Swig of Wine."
Don't budge from here.
If you really wanna be a hit,
repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.
Pastor, when we've finished
the number, bring the sign up slowly.
- Jorge! We have to talk.
- I can't right now. I have to go on.
- Just a minute! It's very important.
- Don't forget!
Let's go.
<i>- Gentlemen, I opine...</i>
<i>...that a swig of wine...</i>
<i>... helps you sing.</i>
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
<i>- Gentlemen, I opine...</i>
<i>...that a swig of wine...</i>
<i>... helps you forget.</i>
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
<i>White wine and red</i>
<i>keep the Reaper away...</i>
<i>For pennies a day.</i>
No money, no booze.
More booze, less money.
<i>Gentlemen, I opine...</i>
<i>... that a swig of wine</i>
<i>... is the whole point of life.</i>
More and more booze,
less and less money.
Very good.
Why do I only get to sing one line?
You need practice!
Your tongue is like a brillo pad.
"No money, no booze.
More booze, less money."
Are you gonna paint that mole
on your face every night?
Yes! It's just like the one
my mother had!
I'm an artist, a lady,
and many even consider me
to be quite respectable.
I never discuss my hemorrhoids,
not even to the monks.
And sometimes
they're as big as sausages.
Feel free to talk about your sausages,
Rocio. You are from Burgos, after all.
Jorge, this is very serious!
I need a bigger washbowl.
There's only one thing
as important as top billing,
and that's the size of my washbowl.
I'll see what I can do.
Thank you.
Oh, Jorge.
Pain is such an awful thing...
Mine is chronic, intimate
and impossible to cure.
- But yours...
- No, mine is different, Rocio.
I know.
But you listen to me.
Trying to ease it
is well worth the effort.
If only there were a washbowl
for that.
You'll have to find it.
Good show, yes indeed.
I liked it.
Here.
Wait.
Here they are.
Rocio Molina Santander.
Rocio Moliner!
- From Burgos.
- Yes, from Gamonal de Riopico.
- My mother was from there...
<i>- Let us sing to Burgos,</i>
<i>blessed treasure...</i>
<i>... which Spain reveres</i>
<i>with deep emotion.</i>
Miguel.
That's enough for today.
I imagine you all want to leave.
You have 3 shows tomorrow, right?
Yes. Matinee, afternoon and evening.
Company, dismissed!
Del Pino, Corgo, Pastor and Ostense!
Will you come with me
for a moment, please?
You too!
Me?
Yes, you, the trumpet player.
Form a semi-circle
and show me your papers.
I know all about you
and I don't like you one bit.
I don't like what you've been
and I don't like who you are.
That's funny,
I know nothing about you
and I like you even less.
Don't mess with me, Del Pino,
or I'll make you disappear.
Lieutenant...
Forgive him, he's a little impulsive.
I wanted to speak to you alone.
Pedro Ostense... You've worked
as a stagehand on a lot of shows.
Yes, for meals.
Of course. I only ask
that from now on, be more...
careful. Do you see
the Lledo brothers very often?
No, I haven't seen them
for some time.
Well, keep it that way, all right?
They're bad news.
Jorge, I haven't heard anything
about you in over a year,
no one's seen you perform...
How did you manage?
I got by.
- Like everybody else.
- Like those of us who could.
Luckily the others haven't had
to deal with problems like yours.
Did you vanish too, or are you new?
I can't quite place you.
I'm a carpenter by trade
but this is my first job
in the theater.
Then get to work, stay out of trouble
and careful who you hang out with.
You like theater,
you like music, you like musicians...
I know your tastes.
What you do behind closed doors
is of no interest to me.
- You make me sick.
- What's that, Lieutenant?
"Valentin Fernandez Alba,
born on June 1st, 1916
in Palomera, Province of Cuenca."
Never been there. Is it pretty?
It's a beautiful place, Captain.
I go back every chance I get.
Is that right,
Valentin Fernandez Alba?
- Yes.
- You think I'm an idiot, do you?
No, sir.
I'm not an idiot,
Valentin Jurado Menendez.
And I'm not the one
who was at a meeting in Ocaña
and who's mixed up in something
brewing that I don't like at all!
It was you and not just you.
Who else is with you?
There is evidence
of your presence at that meeting
and I want to know
who else here knows about it!
I don't know
what you're talking about.
You don't know
what I'm talking about?
If there's one thing I can't stand
it's a sheep.
And a wolf in sheep's clothing,
even less.
No one plays with me...
unless I want them to.
Take him away.
Where were you all?
I was looking for you.
What are you doing here?
- Nothing, Sergeant.
- "Captain", Miguel.
He's a captain.
Don't be scared. Why are you scared?
I'm going to show you a trick.
See this coin?
It's one of the new coins, huh?
Let me see, here we go...
Nothing here...
Nothing there... Where is it?
Want me to show you a trick now?
Go on, time for bed. It's late.
Bed? What about supper?
Get going.
We're not having supper?
Okay.
<i>Why all the questions?</i>
Why us?
Where have they taken poor Valentin?
You know where. They've been picking
on us since the war ended.
Yeah, but I thought
they'd calmed down.
Do you think it's because of Pedro,
or because of me?
- You think it's because of me.
- No, no.
- But we've got to leave.
- Yes. Where to?
I've got friends in Argentina,
Venezuela, Cuba...
Don't start talking about
your friends. Don't talk nonsense.
Why not?
You can't think like that because
of every idiot comes along.
Those idiots showed us
their fangs today
and I don't like it, Jorge.
I don't like it.
And tomorrow or the next day
there'll be another, then another...
and another.
Jorge, it's time to leave all this.
Is this how you want to live?
I've got nothing tying me down here.
Nothing.
You're scared.
Yeah. So what?
- Well, I'm not.
- I don't care.
No thing's tying you down either.
And your wife...
What the hell do you know?!
Obviously nothing!
Because I can't get a word out of you!
- What do you want to know?
- Leave me alone!
Nice job. Avery good rehearsal,
I think...
- we can stop there.
- Yeah.
Were you fighting about work?
Something like that.
It's okay, go back to sleep.
- No, no. I'd rather have supper first.
- Me too.
- Let's see what we've got.
- I'm hungry.
So are we.
Is anybody in this shithole
gonna serve us?
That depends.
Did you bring any money along?
- Not a penny.
- Then quit bothering me. Beat it!
But first give me a hug,
you poor schmuck!
Damn, it's good to see you.
And who's this big kid?
I can't believe it.
How you've grown, little Rafa!
I can't call you little Rafa anymore!
He sure is a Del Pino, eh?
I'm not Rafa. I'm Miguel.
He's not Rafa.
It's just... I'm sorry.
- Have you got a bathroom?
- Yeah, kid. In there.
I'm going to the bathroom.
He wants to do a number with him.
I don't want kids, but here I am.
He's a Puertas.
Do you remember them?
Yes.
- We've gotta go.
- Hold on a second.
- No, we have to go.
- Wait! I'm talking to Marcelino!
Don't ever let me
catch you stealing again!
I didn't want to.
The rice was pouring out,
it looked at me, our eyes met...
What could I do? It was calling me...
That's enough! You want me
to turn you over to Social Services?
Then you'd better quit stealing
or I'll cut off your hand.
I didn't steal it, I made it.
Why did that man call me Rafa?
Do I look like Rafa?
You don't look like Rafa
and never say his name again!
Get up!
You look a bit sad, my dear Sancho.
<i>My job was all I had in life,</i>
<i>and I lost it.</i>
Hey, do you know about
what they're planning?
Who? Another uprising?
No, no, no. Something bigger.
Against who?
- You know, don't you?
- No, no, I know what we all know.
But please, if you hear anything,
don't keep it to yourself, eh?
If I hear anything? Quit bugging me
with this stuff, Pedro!
Do you remember Father Gabriel?
- Father Gabriel? Yes.
- He sends his greetings.
And this.
I'll let you know if something
comes up. Now that you're...
- of age.
- And she has your last name too.
Thanks, Arturo, you're so good.
Thank you.
Did you hear that?
"Arturo, you're so good."
Though something about that sentence
doesn't sound right.
Oh, Arturo, you're so good.
Poor Merceditas.
- When she finds out the truth...
- You need money?
- No, I'm fine.
- Then you can spare some.
Never!
How much will you pay us?
Relax.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I owe a friend a favor,
the Mayor of Alberche del Marqués.
I can't take care of it, but you can.
You have to make me look like...
like a king.
Like a king? Damn!
Well, like a dictator.
You can take part
of my company if you like.
But prepare something worthy
of Arturo del Val.
Wouldn't you prefer something good?
Oh, you're a riot!
Tell me what to do and how much
you want for setting it up.
Nothing, Jorge, please.
- What do you mean?
- You know him.
I won't ask you for a single penny.
Just tell me how much
you're willing to pay.
Sorry, the coffee made me...
Here.
The shows I owed you for.
We'll talk about the rest of it later.
There'll be more.
Oh, Arturo, "you're so good."
Thanks a lot.
Where would we be
without people like you?
"Arturo, you're so good."
Hey, Enrique.
Give me back the fan I lent you.
I gave it back to you
half an hour ago, Rocio.
Hey! The bus!
Stop the bus!
What?
Isn't somebody picking us up?
Oh, for God's sake!
Can't you avoid these potholes?
- She's got hemorroids.
- Who, the mule?
Chusa, watch where you're going,
the lady's got hemorroids!
<i>For you,</i>
<i>I'd count the sand in the sea.</i>
<i>For you...</i>
<i>... willing to kill I'd be.</i>
Would someone really do that?
Killing doesn't take
much encouragement.
<i>God strike me down</i>
<i>if l'm lyin'.</i>
No, he says he could count
the sand in the sea. You can't.
- How do you do that?
- Piece of cake.
"A totalitarian state will harmonize
the operation in Spain
of all the country's
activities and energies
which, within the framework
of national unity,
work being considered
as one of the most
unavoidable of duties,
would be the only exponent
of the popular outcry."
Amen!
Didn't Franco say that?
Harpo Marx.
That jerk promised it would be full.
- Do you have the money?
- Yeah. I put it away.
- Lieutenant. May I speak with you?
- Excuse me.
- What are you doing here?
- Following orders.
Did Montero send you?
- Yes.
- Come on, Quiroga...
What's wrong, Pastor,
don't you like dames?
Good evening, everyone!
You, in the orchestra!
Can you stop playing for a moment!?
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop for a moment!
Thank you very much, very kind.
Pedigree artists.
The most talented of all...
Who's talking?
The mayor.
Antonio, please, lights!
Well, as mayor,
and before opening
this performance
which I arranged
as a tribute to our people...
Stop it! Sit down! Stop!
...our community
and especially to our beloved deceased
Marquis, may he rest in peace...
Children! Stop it!
I'm trying to give a speech!
Thank you so much, thank you.
Well...
What... What I wanted
to say is that... Children!
Will you sit down already!
Your father is speaking!
It's gone... It's gone!
I forgot what I was going to say!
You brats!
Let the show begin.
Thank you very much.
Where are they?
I can't go on!
- What do you mean?
- Not without my glasses.
What do I do?
Should I say something?
No!
- Get on your unicycle right now!
- I can't! I can't!
Get on that unicycle!
- Pizarro!
- Let's go!
- I can't!
- Just get out there!
He killed himself.
Has anybody seen the unicyclist?
You see, we've lost him
and can't find him.
Or the unicycle, and that would be
a great loss. It's a family heirloom.
My great-grandfather
gave it to my grandfather,
my grandfather gave it to my father
and my father sold it to me.
- Come on, we're on.
- But we haven't rehearsed it.
Then we'll rehearse it now
with an audience!
It's a beautiful number,
very romantic,
<i>vivace, allegro ma non troppo,</i>
<i>ritenuto, sostenuto,</i>
<i>linguini al pesto,</i>
equipped with two bedrooms,
kitchen, and a bathroom, entitled:
"How do you expect me
to miss you if you don't leave."
<i>Maestro!</i>
As well as enjoying the performance,
especially your number,
Don Ricardo
wanted to meet you in person.
What an honor!
Mayor, Rocio Moliner.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.
Don Ricardo Ubieto,
Mayor of Alberche del Marqués,
widower, father of two boys,
native of Esteiro
and adoptive son of this blessed town,
which took me in 25 years ago.
But you can just call me Mayor.
Let's immortalize this moment.
I'll have it framed.
Manolo... Thank you.
Stand together, please.
Smile.
Thank you very much.
You were sublime tonight.
I would be delighted...
I'm sorry, I mean,
we'd all be delighted if you sang
another song from your repertoire.
I never accept, Ricardo...
May I call you Ricardo?
Of course, Rocio. Of course.
Well, I never accept requests
of this kind,
and much less offstage.
But coming from your Excellency...
Oh, I'm sorry.
...from you,
I'll sing all night...
if I have to.
Sebastian, please, "The Brazier".
This is for you, Ricardo.
<i>When you're gone</i>
<i>my senses freeze over</i>
<i>and the distance</i>
<i>chills my heart.</i>
<i>I feel sad,</i>
<i>all alone and blue.</i>
<i>I live in an igloo</i>
<i>when we're apart.</i>
<i>The sky begins to sob</i>
<i>and all along my rooftop</i>
<i>gather white teardrops</i>
<i>that chill me from above.</i>
<i>When you're far away</i>
<i>no heat can get in.</i>
<i>My life is a sin</i>
<i>without your love.</i>
<i>Light my brazier, darling.</i>
<i>I can feel the cold in my spine.</i>
<i>Light my brazier</i>
<i>or I'll call for the coal man.</i>
<i>He heats it up just fine.</i>
<i>The fire that fuels my passion</i>
<i>is like lava from a volcano.</i>
<i>It's too cold in here,</i>
<i>light my brazier,</i>
<i>hotter than ever before...</i>
Lieutenant.
Is Madrid too boring, or are we
so good you had to come and see us?
I prefer another type of theater,
a little more refined.
Now...
what I do enjoy is admiring
this woman's beauty.
A little young for you.
She's no longer a minor.
<i>Light my brazier, darling.</i>
<i>I can feel the cold in my spine.</i>
<i>Light my brazier</i>
<i>or I'll call for the coal man.</i>
<i>He heats it up just fine.</i>
<i>The fire that feeds my passion</i>
<i>is like lava from a volcano.</i>
<i>It's too cold in here,</i>
<i>light my brazier,</i>
<i>hotter than ever...</i>
<i>before.</i>
Thank you.
Thank you.
I haven't felt like this
in a long time.
Madam, you have re-ignited
something...
- inside of me.
- Oh, Ricardo.
Don't be so formal.
If you wanted, we could be friends.
Almost all my friends are dead,
Lieutenant.
And I don't feel like
making new ones.
Jorge!
Jorge! Where's Jorge?
Ah, Jorge!
Why don't you play us something
on the... accordion?
That...
- The trikitixa.
- Yes, that little accordion.
It's adorable.
It's very late, Mayor,
and we have another show tomorrow.
By the way, we have a film as well.
Thanks to a friend from Madrid
we're showing the latest newsreel
with images of our beloved Franco.
It's very moving.
How interesting. Do you see him
crying after the firing squads?
Jorge...
A funny thing happens with age.
You lose certain faculties
and your hearing goes...
Just as well...
Come on, how about a little music
before we hit the sack?
We'd better be going. Good night.
Miguel! Miguel!
Now that we're alone,
let's sit down
- and have a drink.
- Whatever you say.
What was that all about?
The truth is, I don't understand you.
If you wanna die,
why do this for a living?
- What are you talking about?
- You act suicidal at times.
What's worse, you endanger
the people who love you.
- And who loves me?
- I do, for example.
Me too.
Hey, you either sleep or walk.
And stay out of adult conversations.
I haven't done anything wrong.
He didn't have to treat us like that.
- He's the one who paid us, Jorge!
- That doesn't mean he owns us.
Always the same,
always on the defensive.
Haven't you suffered enough already?
Why keep testing everyone?
If being around me bothers you
so much, I'll leave in the morning.
I was only joking, I was testing you.
- Screw you!
- Don't talk like that in front of me.
- Jorge! Jorge!
- What's wrong?
- We've been robbed.
- What do you mean, robbed?
Be quiet!
Mayor, the box office earnings
have disappeared.
Luis' dogs are gone, the trunks,
tools, clothing, all of it.
- Things are missing from my trunk...
- Let me speak a moment.
The thief can't be
anyone from Alberche.
These things don't happen here.
That's what he said
after the last robbery.
Whoever it was
is long gone by now.
The bird has flown the coop.
Everybody keep your chins up.
We'll ask the mayor for new dogs.
You'll see, he'll listen to me.
Don't worry, son.
Yes! We'll get the cages now
and go talk to him.
Okay... Silence, please! Look,
the mayor of Castelar de la Vega
is a good friend of mine
and he owes me a favor,
so I'll call him first thing
in the morning to tell him
to hire you this weekend.
I can't promise a big take,
but it's better than nothing, right?
And what do we do
in the meantime?
Frankly, I don't know
what else I can do.
For God's sake, Ricardo.
Don't be so modest. Beds.
Well, if you want you can sleep here.
And food.
We'll see what we can do about meals.
In that case, Mr. Mayor,
we'll do the show.
Remember, you're all invited
to stay for the newsreel.
We'll start first thing tomorrow
afternoon. Check what's missing...
- We can go whenever you're ready.
- Yes, darling.
I still owe you a song.
Then let's go.
Have they gone?
- Has the film started?
- No, not yet.
You have time to get dressed
and put on your makeup. Let's go.
<i>Local bus service</i>
<i>is back up and running</i>
<i>in the streets of Madrid.</i>
<i>60,000 blue shirts from Huelva</i>
<i>and the surrounding province,</i>
<i>filled with patriotic</i>
<i>and Falangist fervor...</i>
- When does the little comedian appear?
- Which one?
- The one with the little mustache.
- There he is.
- He's in all the newsreels.
- He means Chaplin.
Why are you clapping?
You said to clap
whenever the audience claps,
- to encourage them.
- He's right.
Look, he's saluting with his left!
He's turned Socialist!
<i>... about Spain's unity,</i>
<i>freedom and greatness.</i>
<i>And the true purpose</i>

Jorge,
I should hire this guy
for the magic act.
I'd make him vanish into thin air.
For good.
I don't mind, but you should
be more careful what you say.
Relax, Pastor, it's okay.
My mother! That's my mother!
- Your mother?
- Yes, that's her! Right there!
I thought your parents died.
That's what they told me, but look,
I saw the beauty mark!
Didn't his parents sign a release
so he could work?
Jorge forged it.
Jorge, please,
tell them to play the newsreel again!
Okay, we'll talk to them later.
We can't now.
But you will, right?
Yes.
You promise?
I promise.
You don't believe me?
I'll go and get a photo
so you can see it was my mother.
- Could it be true?
- How should I know?
Who knows how old these images are?
They could be 3 years old, or a week.
What about you?
Forging papers, for God's sake!
Just like the good old days, huh?
How about that! The guy has guts.
Nothing scares him.
- Who knows what he's really up to!
- Shut your mouth.
What are you thinking?
Miguel, I asked you a question.
Is it what you saw in the film?
What do you want to know?
Do you think
my mother might be alive,
or is everything we see
on the newsreel a lie,
- like Pedro says?
- No.
Pay no attention to Pedro,
he has a big mouth.
But you'll see. We'll find out.
You promise?
I promise.
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your new dance,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
<i>I want you to show me,</i>
<i>and to learn the Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show it to me, show it to me,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
<i>To dance the Babaloo</i>
<i>glide gently on your feet.</i>
<i>Move your hips just right,</i>
<i>your heart will follow the beat.</i>
<i>Rumba dancers do it great</i>
<i>by always stepping in threes.</i>
<i>They rock their hips back and forth</i>
<i>and cross their legs with ease.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show me your new dance,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
<i>I want you to show me,</i>
<i>and to learn the Babaloo.</i>
<i>Show it to me, show it to me,</i>
<i>I'll dance it just like you.</i>
- Want one?
- Yeah.
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes, yes.
That was my final performance.
It's better this way and you know it.
You don't get too many second
chances at my age.
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- As long as he stays one...
Thanks for thinking of me.
I love you, Moliner.
Will you be okay without me?
We'll be fine.
Well, you could have said no.
He means we'll be fine,
but it won't be the same.
Rocio!
Are you taking this with you?
Keep it as a souvenir.
I don't need it anymore.
- Love cures even hemorrhoids!
- It's not that.
Ricardo promised to buy me a new one.
Gold plated.
That's money for you. It's no cure,
but it sure eases the pain.
In times like these,
any relief you can get...
Well, since we'll never see
each other again,
I guess I'm supposed
to make some big farewell speech
worthy of a great stage actress
like myself.
That's not necessary, Rocio.
- Between us, there's no need.
- Very well.
Then I bid you farewell
with a painful...
to hell with you!
- What did you say, darling?
- No...
Yes, yes.
Tell them about your friend.
Ah! Yes, of course.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
The mayor of Castelar de la Vega
offered his theater.
You can sleep in the dressing rooms.
- Ready to go, darling?
- The photo.
Ah, that's right, the photo, yes.
Well, this is a souvenir
of your stay in Alberche.
- Very nice. Thank you.
- God be with you.
- Thank you very much.
- Goodbye, Moliner!
Excuse me, Jorge. I have to go
to Madrid tomorrow for family reasons,
- but I'll be back tomorrow night.
- Do you have money for the trip?
Yeah. Thanks.
I told the man in the booth
to play the part you said.
- But don't get your hopes up, okay?
- Jorge, my mother's alive,
- I saw her.
- In a film, do you understand?
- In a film!
- No, I saw her there.
The speaker said it was in Almagro.
What you saw on the newsreel
doesn't mean a thing.
Why not? It's my mother.
Why won't anyone believe me?
Look at me. I believe you.
Look, that's her, it's her!
- Who? The woman with the bread?
- Yes! That's her!
I can't see...
It might not be her.
It is her! Look!
She's got the beauty mark!
- You see it?
- It's just a coincidence.
Sir, put my mother on again!
Please, sir!
Put her on again, here on the screen!
- Too bumpy to draw?
- If I make the drawing big enough,
it'll be easier to find her, right?
Yes.
If you give me a photo
of Maria and Rafa,
I can make you a drawing
so that you can look for them too.
That's not necessary.
Why not?
Look what happened with my mother.
I thought she was dead and look...
Don't get your hopes up.
We might not find anything.
The newsreel man
said she was in Almagro.
The newsreel man says
what he's ordered to say.
If you don't wanna help me,
I don't care.
General Franco will be going
to Caceres in 4 days
to meet with high-ranking officers.
He has entrusted me with
the logistics and entertainment.
Is your company to be trusted?
What? To perform
for the <i>Generalísimo?</i>
Yes. Any problem?
No. But there are little things,
remarks they make.
I'd never been around performers.
They say such disrespectful things
about the general
- I have to hold myself back.
- We live in difficult times.
People need to let off steam.
As long as it's only little things...
I still haven't figured out Del Pino.
And I don't like Pedro,
the other stagehand, one bit.
Pedro... Ostense. Yes, the stagehand.
What have you found out?
I hear all kinds of things.
He's constantly whispering
with Del Pino and other members
of the company.
- Somebody should be tailing him.
- Lieutenant, what are you saying?
You need a regiment now
to follow a few comedians?
- Is this mission too much for you?
- No, Captain.
But can't they hire another company?
Don't piss me off.
I've got enough on my plate here.
Go back to your comedians
and have fun.
Don't worry,
I'll help you get them there.
We're going to make sure
this show makes us look good.
- Understood?
- Yes, Captain.
And now I'm going to perform
a number of mine,
composed by Giacomo Puccini,
called "Goodbye Life".
- Goodbye, good day.
- Goodbye, good day, my good man.
- And what do I do in this number?
- Stay out of the way.
Why?
I want to play the trikitixa in this.
Let us rehearse,
we don't have much time.
We put the two jokes in here,
the one about the arm
and then we kick off. Come on.
I might be starving, but my soup
turned out pretty tasty.
Is there anything more delicious
than garlic soup?
Yeah, hot garlic soup.
- Don't slurp your soup.
- It tastes better like that.
Yeah, but don't slurp it.
The guards showed up again
this morning asking for papers.
- Miguel!
- I forgot!
Jorge, we have to go.
Don't start.
Go where?
Nowhere.
Are you gonna eat cold garlic soup
your whole life?
- There's no future here.
- If you want to leave, go ahead.
I can't go on like this.
Begging for work, begging for food...
Look at us.
We share mattresses, nightmares...
- I'd like to see the sea.
- Let's go to America.
- America?
- Really?
Yeah, the four of us.
Buenos Aires, Jorge.
- Buenos Aires is wonderful.
- Have you been there?
No, but I heard all about it.
Well, that's what people say.
Could we take my mother?
If we find her, I mean.
Sure we can.
Miguel de Molina?
No, Jorge Del Pino.
You got the wrong dressing room.
And theater, Lieutenant.
I bring you a message
from Captain Montero.
You will be given the honor
of performing for the <i>Generalísimo.</i>
I'll pick you up
the day after tomorrow.
Merceditas...
Okay. We'll think it over.
No, you don't get it.
We're the ones who do the thinking.
You people stick
to your usual stupidity,
nothing else.
- Hey, Jorge, is it true what I heard?
- What did you hear?
That we're performing for...
Well, you know who.
I'd gladly put
a couple bullets in him.
If I ever got the chance.
I don't give a damn about
what you would or wouldn't do!
What are you doing? We're working!
If he comes to the theater,
we won't get another chance.
We'll be left without any options.
Would you rather die...
or be killed?
- I'd rather not be asked.
- Come on...
No matter how hard you try not to,
you always end up taking a stand.
Bullshit.
A big hand for Mercedes del Val
and her wonderful dancing!
But aren't there two numbers to go?
- Where is he going?
- He didn't say "shit" seven times!
Shit, shit, shit...
- What is he doing?
- I don't know.
Life isn't easy, is it, <i>mon ami?</i>
<i>Oh, bien sur, bien sur, Monsieur!</i>
No food, no justice,
in this country there is no freedom.
<i>Bien sur, bien sur, Monsieur!</i>
- I'm going to sing the other lyrics.
<i>- Très</i> bad idea, <i>Monsieur!</i>
It's not easy living in this country.
Isn't that right, <i>mon ami?</i>
And even harder
if you sing the other lyrics!
A friend of mine said to me:
"Did you know the <i>Generalísimo</i>
is getting older?"
"Great, at least he's finally
doing something!"
<i>Oh well, my friend, c'est la vie.</i>
<i>Money's worth an all-time low.</i>
<i>Wanna buy a pineapple in Madrid?</i>
<i>Prepare yourself for quite a blow.</i>
<i>Nothing to buy, nothing to spend.</i>
<i>Prices as high as they go.</i>
<i>Can't breathe in,</i>
<i>can't breathe out.</i>
<i>I sure could live without Franco.</i>
<i>Oh well, my friend,</i>
<i>life passed away.</i>
<i>Can't even pick the shirt I wear.</i>
<i>My navy blue one faded gray.</i>
<i>I put it on and die of laughter.</i>
<i>I wear it everywhere, even to bed.</i>
<i>It brings tears to my eyes,</i>
<i>you know.</i>
<i>If only I could dye it red.</i>
<i>I sure could live without Franco.</i>
- That was quite a number.
- Did you like it?
I didn't see it,
but I hear nobody laughed.
They've lost their sense of humor.
What's your problem?
Are you cold or trembling with fear?
I'm telling you for your own good.
Don't play with fire.
Stick to your job and nobody
will bother you, I can guarantee it.
Then tell your lieutenant,
the Falangist,
to stop busting my chops.
Haven't you suffered enough?
Go back to your people.
I'll see you in Caceres.
Wait.
I hear the boy thinks
he saw his mother.
Who told you that?
I'm the government,
I know everything.
This is where to look.
- Let's go.
- Wait.
Captain, I still have
some questions for Corgo.
- Then I'm staying.
- No, you're leaving.
Del Pino... What did I tell you?
Quiroga.
Just a few questions?
Go on, move it.
What are you doing there?
Why aren't you in bed?
They kept saying you'd be right back,
but you never came.
- Where's Enrique?
- He'll be right in.
Did they put you in jail?
Merceditas said they would,
and she never lies.
Jail scares me. Does it scare you?
The jailers scare me.
That's what you get
for not saying "shit" seven times.
You're right.
Let's see what we've got here...
What's this?
Look at that! Here. For your fear.
But how do you manage
to always hide the trick?
- I can never catch you.
- It's magic.
When are you going to show me
everything you know?
How to play instruments,
magic tricks, comedy...
You'll learn a lot more
from somebody else.
But I want to learn from you.
It's getting cold.
Come on, let's go to bed.
Just a little longer.
Please.
Where did that little jerk take you?
You had me worried.
It's nothing, nothing...
What did he do to you?
I've had worse nights.
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
It's a personal matter.
Last night I heard Montero and Quiroga
talking about Miguel's mother.
- I told you, it's personal.
- These trucks...
are always breaking down.
It's too far to go alone.
Look out!
Yes, the information is correct,
but don't get your hopes up.
We try to take care of patients
who are dying.
The information was given
to me by the government.
Many of them came here
without identification.
We do have a lady named
Concepcion, with curly hair
and a mole on her cheek.
Is it her?
She looks so pretty here.
Concepcion, sweetie,
a friend is here to see you.
Sit down.
Come closer.
Hello, Concepcion.
You don't know me
but I'm here on behalf of your son.
My name is Jorge del Pino.
Miguel Angel?
Whenever she sees someone,
she only mentions her husband.
He died when the war ended.
Hello, Concepcion.
Miguel is fine.
He's a very good boy, hard-working,
he learns very quickly
and he's a natural performer.
He says it comes from you...
and I believe him,
even if he does lie sometimes.
But he will be a great artist,
don't you worry.
He'll live up to his name.
He's learning
some new instruments now
and he's a born comedian.
You should see him!
He told me that he wanted to write
to you... Well, actually,
he said he wanted to send you drawings
of all the places we've played,
because Miguel also draws very well.
And also...
he makes little paper birds
like this one.
Well, it's not one of his best ones.
I'm sure he got nervous
because he was thinking about you.
We'll take good care of him,
don't worry.
Like one of the family.
How sad, ending up like that.
It must be terrible losing your
husband and living like a vegetable.
This war caused too much pain.
We're lucky it's over.
The war, yeah.
I've suffered too.
They didn't kill your son.
When they kill your son,
you know what suffering really means.
You don't care about anything.
You can't eat, you can't sleep,
and when you do,
you wake up with the same torment,
the same agony.
It goes away because it hurts
so much you don't care anymore.
And you just want to kill...
or you just want to die.
You know how many times
I've taken the pin out of a grenade
and instead of throwing it,
kept it in my hand?
Then one day
I had a grenade in each hand
and everywhere I looked all I saw
were the faces of my wife and son.
And I said: Enough.
One day you wake up
and the war is over
and you think all the death
is behind you and life goes on.
And you just want to die.
- You're not going to sleep?
- I'll stay a while.
Good night.
When will you hear something
about my mother?
Jorge?
I don't know.
We'll get news, don't worry.
Right. Jorge. Jorge!
- Have you seen Quiroga?
- No.
And please, Jorge,
leave things be today.
- He's definitely coming.
- Fine by me.
We can't let a chance
like this slip away.
We have to get rid of him.
Jorge, it's now or never.
It'll go fine,
I've got it all worked out.
- Where's Captain Montero?
- He's coming with the delegation.
Jorge.
I need to talk to you.
I... think the world of you,
Miguel, Enrique... and I don't want
you getting into any trouble.
What are you talking about?
Well, you told me those things
about your past
- and the grenades and...
- And what?
Franco's coming and I'm worried.
What do you mean, you're worried?
About what?
How stupid of me...
I told you things I've never told
anyone. What's this all about, Pastor?
And what about you? What do I know
about you and your life?
Not a thing. I don't know
who you are or where you came from.
And what's more, I don't care.
Not about you, or all those soldiers
or Franco or anyone else
who tries to screw up my life.
People can't even leave me alone
for 5 minutes to get my act ready.
Attention!
His Excellency the <i>Generalísimo!</i>
- Arriba España!
- Viva!
- Viva Franco!
- Viva!
Excuse me, Colonel.
I'm Lieutenant Pastor.
Pastor? We meet at last.
That was some idea of yours, having
the company meet the <i>Generalísimo.</i>
Very bright!
My idea? Excuse me, Colonel,
but I never suggested any such thing.
Besides, I don't think it's very safe.
What do you mean, it's not safe?
Montero said the company is clean.
He can't have told you
such a thing!
Not just the captain! I'm quoting
your own reports, Lieutenant!
I didn't write any report.
And I never spoke to anyone about
Franco meeting the company!
What are you saying?
Jorge,
a chance like this only comes along
once in a lifetime.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
We've been waiting for this moment
for a long time.
What do you mean, we?
Put that away, this makes no sense!
Jorge, I should hire this guy
for the magic act.
I'd make him vanish into thin air.
For good.
The enemy can be anyone.
And you too.
Yes, you, the trumpet player.
Would someone really do that?
Killing doesn't take
much encouragement.
Let the flock come together. There's
plenty of time to send in the wolves.
We're going to make sure this show
makes us look good.
- Understood?
- Yes, Captain.
Is he with us or not?
Yes, he's with us.
I hope Pedro's right.
A lot of people are involved in this
and I don't want to endanger anyone.
Captain...
Take him in the corner!
Get back to your business!
- We have to go.
- What are you talking about?
Don't ask me questions
I can't answer.
Get your coats.
We'll use the back door.
- But we still haven't...
- We're leaving!
The boy got hit on the head.
I'm taking him to a doctor.
He has to go on later in the show.
- What do we do now?
- I don't know. I don't know.
Jorge.
- Are you Luciano?
- Yes.
Father Gabriel sent me.
Good evening.
Antonio, go home, it's late.
Here, Enrique.
It's okay. Don't worry.
Come in, Joaquin.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
He'll take you
to the station in Badajoz.
You must cross into Portugal
as soon as possible.
- Portugal?
- Yes, the train is the safest way.
There are too many checkpoints
if you try through Cadiz or Malaga.
I'll prepare four passports for you.
They're waiting for you in Lisbon
and they'll give you money
for the trip.
Your ship sets sail for Buenos Aires
on Thursday.
Buenos Aires...
- What about my mother?
- We'll talk later.
You can't smoke here.
Why not?
God doesn't smoke.
How do you know?
You don't believe in God. If He
finds out, you're in big trouble.
Miguel.
Miguel.
I don't want to go without my mother.
She'll always be with you.
How do you know? Have you seen her?
The people we love are always with us,
wherever we go.
Are Maria and Rafa always with you?
Always.
And me too?
You? Of course.
When we get to Buenos Aires I'll
teach you how to play instruments
and we'll prepare a new act.
- Just you and me?
- Yeah. Just you and me.
But you'll have to show me one of your
magic tricks to make the act better.
And can I repeat seven times
the word?
Sure you can.
Yeah, I'll let you.
Thanks, Papa.
I have to call you that,
Father Gabriel told me so.
"Papa"...
"Father" is okay.
"Papa" sounds better, I like that
more than calling you "Father."
Besides, I'm the father around here.
Get your things together,
Joaquin has the passports ready
and you have to go.
Let's go.
Remember,
Joaquin will give you the tickets
at the station in Badajoz.
God be with you, my son.
- You didn't give me papers for Him.
- Don't worry.
He always finds a way
to get where he needs to be.
Thank you.
When you tell him about his mother,
tell him she was always
well taken care of.
Now go! Go, it's getting very late!
Luciano Castillo!
Here. You'd better start boarding.
And don't sit together.
- Second-class seats aren't numbered.
- Okay, I'll handle it.
- Thanks a lot, Joaquin.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
- Send me a postcard from Buenos Aires.
- Thank you.
Go now and don't look back.
Why? Why did you lie to me?
I trusted you.
I can't believe it.
One more step
and you're a dead man!
Put the gun down!
You know perfectly well
I had nothing to do with it.
The train's leaving!
Handcuff him!
Why don't you believe me?
Let's go!
Please, Pastor! No!
He has to come with us!
He's my father, please!
Enrique, do something!
They're taking him away! Do something!
Get the car!
Stop! We can't go yet!
Please!
My father has to get on board!
Don't worry.
The boy needs a real father,
not a piece of shit like you.
Run, run!
Stop the train, please!
- Come on! Come on!
- Run! Run!
What are you doing?
Shoot, damn it!
Papa!
Goodbye, son.
I'm a big admirer of yours,
Don Miguel.
It's an honor to be here with you.
My parents and grandparents
also admire you a great deal.
Thank you, thank you very much.
- Say hello to them for me.
- I will.
If you really wanna be a hit,
repeat seven times the word "shit."
Shit, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.
As an old friend of mine used to say,
I don't know if I deserve this award.
But I have gout, rheumatism
and high cholesterol
and I don't deserve
any of that either.
I would've liked to have prepared
a beautiful speech.
Coming back to Spain,
returning to this beloved theater,
being reunited with my old friends...
Actually, not that.
At my age,
unless I visit them at the cemetery...
I thank you for this award
for my career
and I dedicate it to many people,
but they are not here
for me to do so in person.
I'm sorry, forgive me.
You've taken the trouble
to come here,
and I'm boring you
with the stuff of old folks.
No more speeches,
I'm a comedian and not very good
at this sort of thing.
Thank you very much.
Well...
I'm going to dedicate this song
to my parents,
Enrique Corgo...
and Jorge del Pino.
Jorge del Pino taught me this song.
He only let me call him "Papa"...
a couple of times.
After a long time
I finally understood why.
Things from these wars
that never stop haunting us.
Maestro, please.
<i>Oh well, my friend, c'est la vie.</i>
<i>Money's worth an all-time low.</i>
<i>Wanna buy a pineapple in Madrid?</i>
<i>Prepare yourself for quite a blow.</i>
<i>Nothing to buy, nothing to spend.</i>
<i>Prices as high as they go.</i>
<i>Can't breathe in,</i>
<i>can't breathe out.</i>
<i>I sure could live without Franco!</i>
<i>Oh well, my friend,</i>
<i>life passed away.</i>
<i>Can't even pick the shirt I wear.</i>
<i>My navy blue one faded gray.</i>
<i>I put it on and die of laughter.</i>
<i>I wear it everywhere, even to bed.</i>
<i>It brings tears to my eyes,</i>
<i>you know.</i>
<i>If only I could dye it red.</i>
<i>I sure could live without Franco!</i>
